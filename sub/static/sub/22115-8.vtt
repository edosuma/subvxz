00:02.303 --> 00:04.038
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.539
Welcome to Sophe.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.209
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.444
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.478 --> 00:11.545
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:11.579 --> 00:13.381
or to tear us apart.

00:13.414 --> 00:14.648
I know, because I spent my life

00:14.682 --> 00:16.550
trying to turn it
into something

00:16.584 --> 00:19.053
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:19.087 --> 00:21.055
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:21.089 --> 00:22.623
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.658
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:24.692 --> 00:25.959
the police, my ex-wife--

00:25.993 --> 00:28.362
but I was convinced the
wrong man had been convicted

00:28.396 --> 00:30.264
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.200
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:32.233 --> 00:34.668
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.702 --> 00:37.471
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:37.505 --> 00:40.408
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:40.441 --> 00:43.077
you.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.044
Let's get to work.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.616
Ron.

00:48.649 --> 00:53.087
Brought you a present,
you sick degenerate.

00:53.121 --> 00:56.290
Dude, that party last night
was epic.

00:56.324 --> 00:57.558
To $25 million.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.693
To half a billion.

00:59.727 --> 01:02.596
That's the VCs' valuation
after this round.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.232
We built that.
Yeah.

01:04.265 --> 01:05.666
You helped a little bit.
(laughs): Shut up.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.501
Oh, here. Oh.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.470
What I'm talking about.

01:09.503 --> 01:10.604
All right.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.574
Here's to...

01:13.607 --> 01:15.243
caffeine addiction.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.611
Ah.

01:17.645 --> 01:18.679
Oops.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.416
Hey, sorry about your rug.

01:22.450 --> 01:25.419
But, man, what about
Mason and Faith, huh?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.255
("Fight For Your Right"
by The Beastie Boys playing)

01:27.288 --> 01:28.422
(both laughing)

01:28.456 --> 01:29.257
Get a room!

01:32.226 --> 01:34.228
(laughs)

01:34.262 --> 01:36.197
The first thing I'm doing

01:36.230 --> 01:37.498
after the IPO:

01:37.531 --> 01:39.233
buying a jet.
Dude, you hate to fly.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.701
You don't even like
to leave the house.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.137
Why don't you just burn the
IPO money. It'll be prettier.

01:43.171 --> 01:44.638
Ow.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.241
(laughs)

01:49.943 --> 01:52.546
* You got to fight...

01:52.580 --> 01:55.216
All you lushes
can get out of my house.

01:55.249 --> 01:57.351
* To party...

01:57.385 --> 01:58.352
I need my beauty sleep.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.257
BEN: Ron, where the hell
is your lazy ass? Wake up.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.194
(woman screams)

02:10.298 --> 02:12.533
BEN:
We should have stayed

02:12.566 --> 02:14.435
to keep an eye on him.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.371
Ron was wasted out of his mind.

02:17.405 --> 02:21.242
He was so happy,
you know? Like...

02:21.275 --> 02:23.677
like everything we've done
was worth it.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.214
This IPO was gonna
change our lives.

02:26.247 --> 02:27.515
And then this happens?

02:27.548 --> 02:30.251
Falling down the stairs
of your own house?

02:30.284 --> 02:32.586
Like, what kind
of cosmic joke is that?

02:32.620 --> 02:36.357
If I had just stayed...

02:36.390 --> 02:38.359
This didn't have to happen.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.195
I'm so sorry.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.197
Thanks.

02:43.231 --> 02:45.199
(sighs)

02:45.233 --> 02:48.736
Listen... I-I dig Sophe

02:48.769 --> 02:51.205
and how you're putting
your crowdsourcing work

02:51.239 --> 02:52.640
to use and everything,

02:52.673 --> 02:54.342
but why are you here?

02:54.375 --> 02:56.477
I mean, no offense.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.612
SARA: Uh, Sophe consults
with the SFPD.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.715
And since this case
is tech-related,

03:01.749 --> 03:03.551
they asked for our help.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.253
Wait, what case?

03:05.286 --> 03:06.620
Ron fell. It was an accident.

03:06.654 --> 03:08.489
CAVANAUGH:
Not quite.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.823
For the moment, at least,

03:09.857 --> 03:12.660
our M.E. has labeled this
a homicide.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.496
According to the doc,

03:15.529 --> 03:16.730
Ron was murdered.

03:16.764 --> 03:19.567
What?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.369
Everybody loved Ron.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.671
Someone didn't.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.839
And the exterior
surveillance cameras

03:25.873 --> 03:27.608
show that no one
snuck into the house.

03:27.641 --> 03:31.345
The M.E. puts the time
of death at 2:30 a.m.

03:31.379 --> 03:33.781
when only three people
were left at the party,

03:33.814 --> 03:36.384
you being one of them.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.287
I-I've known Ron
since we were interns at Google.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.522
We-we came up together.
We built JavaWell

03:41.555 --> 03:43.457
from nothing

03:43.491 --> 03:45.359
into a powerhouse together.
I did not kill him.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.531
No, Captain Picard
was a diplomat.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.433
He was a philosopher.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.368
But if you push too far,
he could still kick your ass.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.537
Two words: tactical ability.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.606
And we wouldn't even
be having this debate

03:58.639 --> 03:59.807
if it wasn't for Kirk.
He set the standard,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.375
and you can't argue with that.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.377
I can argue with that.
This is me, arguing with that.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.545
Dude, what is Prudence doing?

04:05.846 --> 04:07.515
JOSH:
I forgot

04:07.548 --> 04:08.616
to lock my terminal.

04:08.649 --> 04:09.850
Should I say something?

04:09.883 --> 04:11.619
I can't say something.
We're in that weird

04:11.652 --> 04:12.720
"kind of dating" place

04:12.753 --> 04:13.821
where we're not talking
about it.

04:13.854 --> 04:15.356
I don't want to mess that up.

04:15.389 --> 04:17.358
Yeah. Good luck with that.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.493
Hey. What are you doing?

04:19.527 --> 04:20.894
I-I thought you were in the
bathroom or something.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.463
Yeah, I was.

04:22.496 --> 04:23.764
But that's
when I got to thinking

04:23.797 --> 04:25.599
about how you clearly
don't appreciate

04:25.633 --> 04:28.569
the sociocultural critique
that death metal represents.

04:28.602 --> 04:29.803
But why are you, uh...

04:31.339 --> 04:32.773
I swear you're trolling me

04:32.806 --> 04:34.642
with the whole
death metal thing.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.478
I mean, you don't really listen
to that stuff, do you?
(chuckles)

04:37.511 --> 04:38.679
Best day off ever.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.647
TANNER:
Hey.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.681
What do we got?

04:40.714 --> 04:42.316
On JavaWell?

04:42.350 --> 04:43.684
The sweater
from Mia's apartment.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.653
Our best lead yet on the killer?

04:45.686 --> 04:46.687
Right. Course. Um...

04:46.720 --> 04:48.356
users have submitted
a whole bunch of pictures

04:48.389 --> 04:49.857
of different men wearing it,

04:49.890 --> 04:51.559
and Sophe's using
the measurement diagram

04:51.592 --> 04:54.695
to compare sizes,
but no extra-larges yet.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.598
That's it? That's all you have?

04:57.631 --> 04:58.899
With under a thousand of
those sweaters sold,

04:58.932 --> 05:01.402
that's pretty good.
No, no.

05:01.435 --> 05:03.537
Until we find something,
it's not.

05:03.571 --> 05:05.539
(ringing)
That's Sara.

05:05.573 --> 05:06.540
Uh, put her up.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.376
Yeah.

05:08.409 --> 05:09.543
Did you get the data I just sent

05:09.577 --> 05:10.544
from Ben Oberly's interview?

05:10.578 --> 05:11.945
Uber for coffee.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.781
Even for a tech start-up,
that's elitist.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.516
Well, you can hate all you want,

05:15.549 --> 05:17.351
but these guys paid their dues,

05:17.385 --> 05:19.487
and their financials are real.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.555
This IPO isn't happening
by accident.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.657
And Howland didn't die
by accident, either.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.526
The M.E. said he fell,

05:25.559 --> 05:27.528
but it's the blow on the
head that killed him.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.729
We found the murder weapon
on top of the stairs,

05:28.762 --> 05:30.731
wiped clean. Here.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.801
TARIQ:
Death by hackathon trophy.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.436
What a way to go.

05:35.469 --> 05:36.970
Keep that under wraps for now.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.706
We have three suspects
and no physical evidence

05:38.739 --> 05:40.808
that points to anyone.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.610
The less they think we know,
better chance they slip up

05:42.643 --> 05:43.977
on their own.

05:44.011 --> 05:44.845
We have the other
two interviews

05:45.679 --> 05:47.415
coming in soon--
the head of product

05:47.448 --> 05:49.550
and a woman who works
for U.X. or something.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.585
User experience.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.587
Great. She knows.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.423
Anyway, I'm going after
all of them,

05:55.456 --> 05:57.958
so any ammunition you have,
now's the time.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.993
Well, you got
to ask nicely, Detective.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.496
Or I could just arrest you
for obstructing justice.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.864
Tariq.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.667
Fine. I found something weird
on the victim's computer.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.469
It's a memo he was writing

06:08.502 --> 06:09.603
criticizing diversity
initiatives

06:09.637 --> 06:11.505
in the tech world.

06:11.539 --> 06:13.474
It looks like he was gonna send
it out to the entire company.

06:13.507 --> 06:14.842
Like that asinine Google post

06:14.875 --> 06:16.477
that said women were inferior.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.412
I think that's
what he was responding to.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.781
"Diversity has become
the tech world's third rail.

06:20.814 --> 06:21.815
"We're not allowed
to question it,

06:21.849 --> 06:23.617
"but, as engineers,
it's our duty

06:23.651 --> 06:24.985
"to question everything.

06:25.018 --> 06:27.020
"And hiring more women
and minorities

06:27.054 --> 06:28.889
"isn't actually making
us more successful,

06:28.922 --> 06:30.958
just more politically correct."

06:30.991 --> 06:31.992
Lovely.

06:32.025 --> 06:34.762
And it's your ammunition.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.798
Uber took a big hit
from that sexism scandal.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.634
It lost market shares,
publicity and goodwill.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.035
A start-up like JavaWell

06:42.069 --> 06:44.605
could lose everything
if that memo got out.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.006
Could be a motive for murder.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.541
JOSH:
Hey, look at this.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.478
Users keep focusing on
JavaWell's proprietary app.

06:50.511 --> 06:51.679
They're saying it could
help crack the case.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.714
Why? How would their app help?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.583
I'm asking the crowd right now.

06:55.616 --> 06:56.717
(alarm blaring)

06:57.885 --> 06:59.520
Yeah, what's that?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.054
That's the server
overload warning.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.523
Talk to me. What's happening?

07:03.524 --> 07:04.024
Traffic's spiking. It's
overloading the system.

07:05.258 --> 07:05.926
TARIQ: We're being slammed with
too many requests to handle.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.561
Try to black hole the traffic.

07:08.395 --> 07:08.929
W-We can't.
It's too distributed.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.798
It's coming from everywhere.

07:10.831 --> 07:13.033
It's a DDoS.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.067
CAVANAUGH:
Okay, what is that?

07:14.101 --> 07:15.569
It's a denial-of-service attack.

07:15.603 --> 07:16.704
Cybercriminals use it

07:16.737 --> 07:18.472
to knock websites off-line.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.940
They send so much traffic
to the site that the servers

07:19.973 --> 07:21.942
just get overwhelmed.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.677
It's like directing a fire hose
through your pipes--

07:23.711 --> 07:25.746
nothing else
can make it through.

07:25.779 --> 07:26.880
Can't you just stop it, or...

07:29.082 --> 07:30.851
What?

07:33.687 --> 07:34.655
JOSH:
What the hell just happened?

07:39.927 --> 07:43.096
Sophe's off-line.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.865
*

07:55.308 --> 07:57.678
If you can get
enough servers online...

07:57.711 --> 07:59.212
The basement.
The guys in the server room

07:59.246 --> 08:00.981
could use your help.

08:01.014 --> 08:01.849
All hands on deck.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.218
Anything?

08:05.252 --> 08:06.219
Working on it.

08:06.253 --> 08:06.887
SARA:
Jeffrey,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.222
we can't access Sophe at all.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.559
The DDoS took us down.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.094
Without Sophe,
we'll never solve Mia's case,

08:14.127 --> 08:16.597
which is exactly why
we need to fix this.

08:16.630 --> 08:17.965
JOSH: We're doing
everything we can,

08:17.998 --> 08:19.299
but we're getting slammed

08:19.332 --> 08:21.034
with over 600 gigabits
per second.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.703
The only thing that could
generate this much traffic

08:22.736 --> 08:25.939
is a massive botnet like Mirai.
TARIQ: Baby monitors.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.274
We're being taken down by
unsecured baby monitors,

08:27.307 --> 08:29.109
home routers, freaking DVRs.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.011
S-Sara, what are they
babbling about?

08:31.044 --> 08:34.047
Botnets take over devices

08:34.081 --> 08:35.716
connected to the Internet.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.250
Things like home appliances.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.187
They use them to direct traffic
to websites.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.590
Huge ones like Mirai
have control of so many devices,

08:42.623 --> 08:44.592
the sites can't handle

08:44.625 --> 08:46.293
the traffic, so they just crash.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.260
TANNER: Well,
someone has to be controlling

08:47.294 --> 08:50.097
these baby monitors.

08:50.130 --> 08:53.133
You were just making progress
at the JavaWell case, right?

08:53.166 --> 08:54.735
CAVANAUGH:
You think someone at JavaWell

08:54.768 --> 08:56.737
took Sophe down
so we wouldn't solve the murder?

08:56.770 --> 08:58.672
TANNER: They're a tech company.
Their people have skills.

08:58.706 --> 08:59.907
Right? Plus,
you can rent time

09:00.841 --> 09:02.075
on the botnet
on the dark web for what--

09:02.109 --> 09:03.744
$20,000 in bitcoin?

09:03.777 --> 09:05.312
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

09:05.345 --> 09:06.279
SARA: Well, actually,
when we interviewed

09:06.313 --> 09:08.015
Ben Oberly,

09:08.048 --> 09:09.249
he knew about Sophe.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.051
He was asking us
why we were involved.

09:11.084 --> 09:11.985
TANNER:
And there it is.

09:12.019 --> 09:13.320
Sara, stay right there.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.956
Figure out who at JavaWell
is behind this.

09:15.989 --> 09:19.126
The faster we solve this murder,
the faster we get Sophe back.

09:19.159 --> 09:20.761
(sighs) But no pressure.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.295
Looks like
our next interview's here.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.197
Faith Laferty.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.299
("Fight For Your Right"
by Zen Boy & Karma Girl playing)

09:26.333 --> 09:28.669
Faith, lighten up.
No, I'm good.

09:28.702 --> 09:31.304
After 12 failed start-ups,
I deserve this.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.974
(distorted):
Lucky number 13.

09:34.007 --> 09:35.776
RON:
Get a room, Mason.

09:35.809 --> 09:36.677
Hey, get off me.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.782
(distorted):
Faith.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.283
All right, when we IPO,

09:43.316 --> 09:45.318
I'm buying Jet Skis.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.087
And a yacht to pull them.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.090
(laughs) You hate water.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.660
Well, with this much money,
I'll learn to like it.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.228
* Man, living at home
is such a drag *

09:57.665 --> 09:59.700
Faith.

09:59.733 --> 10:03.036
(distorted):
Faith.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.673
* Busted

10:05.706 --> 10:07.274
* You got to fight

10:07.307 --> 10:10.043
Faith.

10:10.077 --> 10:12.079
* To party...

10:12.112 --> 10:15.182
CAVANAUGH: Do you remember
anything else about that night?

10:15.215 --> 10:18.686
Honestly, I was pretty trashed.

10:18.719 --> 10:20.220
My LSD microdose
turned out to be

10:20.253 --> 10:22.222
a lot less micro than I thought.

10:22.255 --> 10:22.923
SARA: Some people
in the tech industry

10:22.956 --> 10:25.759
think it helps you stay focused.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.094
Uh-huh.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.063
FAITH: I needed to
be somewhere quiet,

10:30.097 --> 10:31.665
so I stayed in the bathroom.

10:31.699 --> 10:34.101
But I left
when Ron kicked everyone out.

10:34.134 --> 10:37.104
RON: All you lushes can
get out of my house.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.240
* Party...

10:40.273 --> 10:43.711
And now he's just... gone.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.813
You said Mason hassled you.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.180
What about Ron?

10:47.214 --> 10:49.082
Ron never
gave me any trouble.

10:49.116 --> 10:51.251
He even helped me
when I wanted to move teams

10:51.284 --> 10:53.253
to get more
technical experience.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.188
He was a good boss.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.190
SARA: When I was
at university,

10:57.224 --> 10:59.827
I had this computer science T.A.

10:59.860 --> 11:02.295
who used to call me
Mary Poppins.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.832
Kept asking
for a spoonful of sugar.

11:04.865 --> 11:08.068
Yeah. At my first internship,
my supervisor would say,

11:08.101 --> 11:09.737
"You should just sit there

11:09.770 --> 11:11.872
and look pretty."
(scoffs)

11:11.905 --> 11:15.442
Funny how my ideas
always ended up being his ideas.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.111
Well, that's all just...

11:18.145 --> 11:20.447
boys being boys, right?

11:20.480 --> 11:23.383
Look, whatever happened,
you can tell us.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.753
It will stay in this room.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.254
This is not me being loyal.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.389
Ron was awkward--

11:29.422 --> 11:33.093
so are a lot of programmers--
but he never hassled me.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.395
Not like the others.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.897
SARA: Did you know
that he was writing

11:36.930 --> 11:38.732
a memo questioning

11:38.766 --> 11:42.169
the value of women
and minorities in the workplace?

11:42.202 --> 11:44.738
No.

11:44.772 --> 11:47.875
But, then, I guess you never
really know anyone, do you?

11:47.908 --> 11:50.343
Now that Ron's dead,

11:50.377 --> 11:53.313
what happens to his ownership
stake in the company?

11:53.346 --> 11:56.449
It'll get redistributed...
between the current employees.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.451
The guys set it up
that way.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.821
Yes, my stake
will be worth more.

12:00.854 --> 12:03.190
No, I wouldn't kill for it.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.457
SARA:
This, um, microdose

12:04.491 --> 12:06.193
that you took,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.195
I'm assuming you
bought it online?

12:08.228 --> 12:10.230
CAVANAUGH:
Girl, please,

12:10.263 --> 12:14.467
I'm here to solve a murder,
not bust you for being stupid.

12:14.501 --> 12:18.471
There's a guy
in our tech support division.

12:18.505 --> 12:21.809
He supplies it.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.510
So you didn't pay for it
with bitcoin?

12:23.543 --> 12:25.412
Please. Crypto-currency?

12:25.445 --> 12:27.948
That's a bubble about to pop.
I never touch it.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.317
Talk to Mason.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.153
He loves that stuff.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.255
MASON:
Come on, Faith, cut it out.

12:35.288 --> 12:36.523
Hey, people are watching.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.191
You bet they are.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.860
(laughs)

12:39.893 --> 12:41.361
You know, if this
is what a VC round does to you,

12:41.394 --> 12:43.363
I can't wait for the IPO.
(giggles)

12:43.396 --> 12:44.798
Mason, this is not your bedroom.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.199
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.268
(glass shatters)

12:48.301 --> 12:49.436
(groans)

12:49.469 --> 12:51.238
I think I'm gonna be sick.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.374
First IPO present to myself:
brand-new skis.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.910
(laughs):
Dude, you hate the snow.

12:56.944 --> 12:59.880
Well, let's just say
I'm warming up to it.

12:59.913 --> 13:01.882
*

13:07.855 --> 13:10.423
("Fight For Your Right to Party"
by The Dagmars playing)

13:14.962 --> 13:18.431
* I'll kick you out of my home
if you don't cut that hair *

13:19.900 --> 13:21.902
* Aw, your mama busted in...

13:21.935 --> 13:24.371
All you lushes
can get out of my house.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.541
I need my beauty sleep.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.912
* 'Cause you gotta fight

13:31.945 --> 13:33.881
* For your right...

13:33.914 --> 13:35.849
CAVANAUGH: And you didn't see
where Ron went?

13:35.883 --> 13:37.317
Nah.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.320
Last I saw, he was wasted
but still on his feet.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.521
Alive.

13:43.924 --> 13:46.326
None of this makes sense.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.561
We were going to Vegas
for Thanksgiving--

13:48.595 --> 13:50.030
the high-roller suite
and everything.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.531
He was so stoked.

13:51.564 --> 13:54.301
And... now...

13:54.334 --> 13:56.469
What about Faith?

13:56.503 --> 13:58.972
She was wasted, too?

13:59.006 --> 14:00.941
(sighs):
I guess.

14:00.974 --> 14:03.543
Girls and liquor, man.
(chuckles)

14:03.576 --> 14:06.880
Just another reason why women
don't belong in tech, right?

14:06.914 --> 14:08.581
No need to be defensive.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.550
Okay? I love women in tech.

14:10.583 --> 14:14.321
Ron said the same thing
in a memo about how...

14:14.354 --> 14:16.056
female programmers
aren't as qualified

14:16.089 --> 14:18.058
as the men around them.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.659
No way.
I talked him out of that.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.461
So you knew
about the memo.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.263
Ron thought he was
some kind of intellectual

14:23.296 --> 14:24.664
out to change
the industry.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.000
But I'm the one that convinced
him not to be an idiot.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.601
I mean, look, you can think

14:28.635 --> 14:30.470
whatever you want,
you just can't say it.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.072
You don't want
to scare the investors.

14:32.105 --> 14:35.675
But you love
women in tech, right?

14:35.708 --> 14:38.078
(sighs) Shouldn't you
be off fixing Sophe?

14:38.111 --> 14:39.947
Heard it crashed.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.681
Bummer.

14:41.714 --> 14:44.952
Tell me, who takes over
Ron's duties now?

14:44.985 --> 14:46.086
I don't know.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.321
Me, probably. Of course.

14:48.355 --> 14:49.422
And you'll get a bigger stake

14:49.456 --> 14:51.358
in the company, too,
as well, right?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.293
We all will.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.328
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

14:55.362 --> 14:57.430
I didn't kill Ron.

14:57.464 --> 15:00.367
When my last job completely
overreacted to this...

15:00.400 --> 15:02.602
joking text I sent,
Ron was the only one

15:02.635 --> 15:04.938
that had my back--
he was my friend.

15:09.409 --> 15:13.380
He was my friend,
and I never would have hurt him.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.348
So, with the IPO on the horizon,

15:15.382 --> 15:17.985
they all stood to benefit
from his death.
Mm-hmm.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.687
As much as I hate to admit it,
Faith could have found out

15:20.720 --> 15:23.390
about the memo and saw
it as an opportunity

15:23.423 --> 15:26.059
to get rich and get
rid of a techbro.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.728
Two birds with one stone.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.598
Yeah.

15:31.631 --> 15:34.034
Tell me something.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.568
Did you notice
anything off

15:35.602 --> 15:38.138
about their accounts
of that night?

15:38.171 --> 15:40.440
They were all different.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.509
Except the end.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.677
They all said they were drunk
or high or both,

15:44.711 --> 15:47.014
and then every other detail
was different...

15:47.047 --> 15:49.149
But Ron's last words
were exactly the same.

15:49.182 --> 15:53.053
All you lushes
can get out of my house.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.721
I need my beauty sleep.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.356
So you're saying
they huddled together

15:56.389 --> 15:57.724
and got their stories straight.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.526
Even if they're covering
for each other,

15:59.559 --> 16:02.029
only one of them
hit Ron over the head.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.631
Question is, which one?

16:04.664 --> 16:06.433
PRUDENCE: The thing that people
don't get about death metal

16:06.466 --> 16:08.101
is that it's a response
to the superficiality

16:08.135 --> 16:09.502
of consumerist culture.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.038
It's people screaming.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.173
It's an expression
of the chaos of being.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.175
It speaks to those
who won't conform.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.509
By screaming.

16:16.543 --> 16:17.577
You two are perfect
for each other.

16:17.610 --> 16:20.080
Okay, this is no use.
The techs keep bringing on

16:20.113 --> 16:21.748
more servers, but
they keep crashing.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.483
And the techs keep crying.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.018
The traffic's coming in
from everywhere.

16:25.052 --> 16:27.154
Who knew baby monitors
could do this much damage?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.389
I hope Tanner's
got an idea,

16:29.422 --> 16:31.358
'cause we're tapped out.

16:34.761 --> 16:36.796
(phone beeps)

16:36.829 --> 16:37.997
(phone beeps)

16:39.632 --> 16:41.768
What do you want, Jeffrey?

16:41.801 --> 16:44.404
I need your help, all right?
Sophe's down.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.705
We're under attack by a botnet.

16:45.738 --> 16:46.806
The only way

16:46.839 --> 16:48.641
for us to get back online

16:48.675 --> 16:51.078
is to host the site
on a network so big,

16:51.111 --> 16:53.080
no amount of traffic
can take it down.

16:53.113 --> 16:54.714
A site like Ratchet.

16:54.747 --> 16:56.749
Millions of people
search Ratchet simultaneously

16:56.783 --> 16:59.619
all over the world--
it could easily handle

16:59.652 --> 17:01.654
the kind of traffic that
is keeping Sophe off-line.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.723
Jeffrey, even if I wanted
to help you,

17:03.756 --> 17:05.525
Vikram won't help you.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.526
He hates you.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.428
But he adores you.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.098
If you called him as a friend
and appealed to him...

17:11.131 --> 17:13.466
You are literally
so unbelievable.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.768
I have been begging you
to stop this whole thing,

17:15.802 --> 17:17.470
and now you're
asking for my help

17:17.504 --> 17:19.206
to get it back online. Really?

17:19.239 --> 17:20.840
I know it's a lot to ask,

17:20.873 --> 17:23.676
but this isn't
just about Mia anymore.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.216
We're helping people.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.853
We're giving parents
the kind of closure

17:33.886 --> 17:36.556
that we wish we had.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.858
But we can't do it
without Sophe.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.594
We can't.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.430
Please, Alex.

17:46.833 --> 17:48.835
Okay, I'll call Vikram.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.504
But no guarantees.

17:51.538 --> 17:52.872
Thank you.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.274
You know,

17:54.307 --> 17:55.842
I really appreciate this, and...

17:55.875 --> 17:57.877
(phone beeps)

17:57.910 --> 18:00.213
(door closes)

18:04.184 --> 18:07.820
WOMAN: FBI! Everyone step away
from your computers.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.822
Away. Everyone.

18:11.258 --> 18:14.161
Mr. Tanner,
I presume?

18:14.194 --> 18:15.562
Special Agent Driscoll.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.298
This is our tech expert,
Isaac Wallace.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.200
And this is a
federal warrant

18:20.233 --> 18:22.502
giving us access
to Sophe.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.637
Your network,
your personnel, everything.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.273
What-what the hell is going on?

18:26.306 --> 18:27.874
You're under attack
by a botnet.

18:27.907 --> 18:30.210
Yeah, no kidding.
We believe it's one

18:30.243 --> 18:31.678
the FBI has been tracking,

18:31.711 --> 18:34.281
run by a foreign
criminal organization.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.648
Our intel suggests
it may be planning

18:35.682 --> 18:37.850
a strike
on U.S. infrastructure soon.

18:37.884 --> 18:39.552
We don't have any time
for this, okay?

18:39.586 --> 18:40.820
We're pretty sure
that JavaWell

18:40.853 --> 18:42.622
is behind all this--
it's a company

18:42.655 --> 18:43.823
that we're
investigating...

18:43.856 --> 18:45.692
Well, anything is possible.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.894
But JavaWell could very well
be renting the botnet

18:47.927 --> 18:49.896
in order to launch its attack.

18:49.929 --> 18:53.233
Either way, in the interests
of national security,

18:53.266 --> 18:56.603
the FBI will need access to
Sophe's servers to investigate.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.771
We'll also need to
question everyone here.

19:05.612 --> 19:07.580
You want a suspect?
You got one: JavaWell.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.182
And we're looking into that,
but we need to consider

19:09.216 --> 19:10.583
all angles, Mr. Tanner.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.719
For example, could
someone out there

19:12.752 --> 19:14.687
think Sophe knows
something it shouldn't?

19:14.721 --> 19:15.922
Yeah.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.590
JavaWell.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.526
Or, is this more about you,

19:19.559 --> 19:21.594
and Sophe's
just collateral damage?

19:21.628 --> 19:24.331
You've certainly
made enemies.

19:24.364 --> 19:25.965
Vikram Singh, for example.

19:25.998 --> 19:29.302
VIKRAM (on video): Jeffrey
and I had different visions

19:29.336 --> 19:30.803
for AllSourcer.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.672
And when it became clear
they were incompatible,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.974
I chose to leave
and focus on Ratchet instead.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.876
Now, Ratchet's market cap

19:36.909 --> 19:39.212
surpassed AllSourcer's
three years ago.

19:39.246 --> 19:41.314
I'd say I made a wise move.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.317
Ratchet's stock is inflated.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.719
And ousted CEOs
don't let things go.

19:46.753 --> 19:49.622
Sounds like
motive to me.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.791
There's 116 bad things
I could say about Vikram,

19:51.824 --> 19:56.296
but he wouldn't waste
his time on this.

19:56.329 --> 19:58.331
Then maybe it's closer to home.

19:58.365 --> 20:01.568
How much do you know
about Tariq Bakari?

20:01.601 --> 20:03.303
(chuckles):
Oh, come on.

20:03.336 --> 20:06.373
Tariq has nothing
to do with this.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.376
He's a known gray-hat hacker.
He's made enemies, too.

20:09.409 --> 20:11.911
Can you tell us how it is
that you hired Mr. Bakari?

20:11.944 --> 20:14.714
Tariq demonstrated skills
that we needed.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.349
He hacked you.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.718
It was a bold move.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.853
DRISCOLL: The way I
see it, Mr. Tanner,

20:20.887 --> 20:22.989
while you may be focused
on JavaWell,

20:23.022 --> 20:25.925
there are multiple people who
might want to take Sophe out.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.995
Maybe you
should widen your view.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.963
Well, maybe you shouldn't ignore

20:30.997 --> 20:33.300
what's right in front
of your face.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.601
JavaWell.

20:38.405 --> 20:40.840
What's happening?

20:40.873 --> 20:42.675
Congratulations.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.278
You've been raided by
the federal government.

20:45.312 --> 20:47.880
Check that off the bucket list.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.649
JOSH: Sara, this is Prudence--
she's just visiting

20:49.682 --> 20:52.752
on her day off.
Oh. Right. The girlfriend, yes.

20:52.785 --> 20:55.855
What? No, she's not-- I...
Can we move on, please?

20:55.888 --> 20:57.023
TARIQ:
The FBI are investigating

20:57.056 --> 20:58.691
the denial-of-
service attack,

20:58.725 --> 21:01.060
and they want to talk
to all of us.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.895
Yay.

21:02.929 --> 21:04.364
DRISCOLL:
Sara Morton.

21:04.397 --> 21:05.598
Please come with me.

21:13.005 --> 21:16.743
Is someone out there punishing
Sophe for your sins, Ms. Morton?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.878
You think this is my fault?

21:18.911 --> 21:20.780
How is this my fault?

21:20.813 --> 21:23.783
Of course it's
the brown guy's fault.

21:23.816 --> 21:26.419
AllSourcer has
a temporary restraining order

21:26.453 --> 21:27.920
barring you
from working at Sophe,

21:27.954 --> 21:30.423
and yet... here you are.

21:30.457 --> 21:32.659
On the advice
of our C.O.O., Mike Leigh,

21:32.692 --> 21:34.727
I'm staying pending a hearing.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.829
So maybe this attack
is a power play.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.931
Could it be AllSourcer's attempt
to try and stop you

21:38.965 --> 21:41.000
from using technology
that it says it owns?

21:41.033 --> 21:42.802
AllSourcer wouldn't do that.

21:42.835 --> 21:45.037
I mean, I hope
they wouldn't.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.773
I used to work there--
they're not that evil.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.475
Are they?

21:48.508 --> 21:50.076
It's JavaWell, right?

21:50.109 --> 21:52.345
I-I mean, they're about to IPO.
It makes sense.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.713
Why are you so nervous, Josh?

21:56.883 --> 21:59.886
I've been doing this
a long time.

21:59.919 --> 22:02.389
If there's one thing
I know how to spot,

22:02.422 --> 22:03.856
it's a guilty conscience.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.759
Trust me,

22:06.793 --> 22:09.462
you'll feel better
once you get it off your chest.

22:11.398 --> 22:13.366
In grad school, I hacked into

22:13.400 --> 22:14.867
MIT's server to
delete an e-mail

22:14.901 --> 22:16.703
I sent to a girl.
But I was, like, really wasted.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.806
I-I can't be held responsible
for that, right?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.908
Oh, God, I'm going to prison.
WALLACE: Do you make it a habit

22:21.941 --> 22:23.976
of taking liberties
with other people's networks?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.912
I'm a curious guy.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.747
But whatever I did,
it's to expose

22:27.780 --> 22:29.416
fat cats who take advantage
of people

22:29.449 --> 22:30.883
who don't know
any better.

22:30.917 --> 22:35.154
If that makes them mad, good.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.391
So maybe this botnet attack
is payback for your misdeeds.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.793
Who, Tariq?
Yes.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.795
Have you noticed any...

22:42.829 --> 22:44.731
suspicious behavior from him?

22:44.764 --> 22:45.998
What, because Tariq's Muslim,

22:46.032 --> 22:48.000
he must be a criminal?

22:48.034 --> 22:50.803
What's next? Are you gonna
call him a terrorist?

22:50.837 --> 22:53.906
Disappear him off somewhere?
Think about it.

22:53.940 --> 22:56.543
What do you really know
about Tariq?

22:56.576 --> 22:59.446
He's my punishment,
put on Earth to torture me.

22:59.479 --> 23:01.414
Wait, why are you asking
about him?

23:01.448 --> 23:02.849
WALLACE:
Did you know that Tariq

23:02.882 --> 23:06.753
has made a lot of money
from bug bounty programs?

23:06.786 --> 23:10.823
So what? Companies ask hackers
to find flaws in their networks.

23:10.857 --> 23:13.059
If I happen to be
awesome at what I do,

23:13.092 --> 23:14.927
that's hardly a crime.

23:14.961 --> 23:17.096
But where does
all that money go?

23:17.129 --> 23:18.931
Back to your friends
and family in India?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.867
(scoffs)
Maybe Pakistan?

23:20.900 --> 23:24.003
Dude, try "I help my parents
pay for their house."

23:24.036 --> 23:26.939
You know how expensive it is
to live in San Francisco?
WALLACE: Fine.

23:26.973 --> 23:29.442
So if this botnet attack
isn't because of you,

23:29.476 --> 23:30.977
is it because
of other Sophe users?

23:31.010 --> 23:33.179
Are there any other hackers
among them?

23:33.212 --> 23:35.982
Any... government employees?
You have

23:36.015 --> 23:40.520
no idea what's going on, do you?

23:40.553 --> 23:42.922
You're just fishing.

23:42.955 --> 23:45.492
And you're wasting
everybody's time.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.993
We done here?

24:05.578 --> 24:07.980
(computers whirring)

24:09.849 --> 24:12.619
(applause)

24:12.652 --> 24:14.787
(cheering)

24:16.989 --> 24:19.125
You don't deserve me, you know.

24:19.158 --> 24:20.927
I never did.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.862
Sophe's back on.

24:22.895 --> 24:24.163
Thank you.

24:24.196 --> 24:25.598
You're welcome.

24:25.632 --> 24:28.034
It was great
to connect with Vikram.

24:28.067 --> 24:29.602
It gave me an excuse
to reminisce

24:29.636 --> 24:31.170
about the good old days,
you know.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.139
The three of us and some ramen.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.908
I miss the good old days.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.243
Even the ramen.

24:37.276 --> 24:39.045
Um, I'm gonna go ahead
and forward you

24:39.078 --> 24:41.914
all of the technical stuff
so you can have a look at this.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.617
I don't understand it,
and I don't want to pretend to.

24:44.651 --> 24:45.852
Well, I appreciate it.

24:46.819 --> 24:47.920
Now if I can just get the FBI
off my back,

24:47.954 --> 24:49.155
I'll be all right.

24:49.188 --> 24:52.959
Wait, Jeffrey,
what about the FBI?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.161
They're getting in the way here.
I actually have to go.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.598
Seriously, Alex, thank you.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.936
David?

25:03.970 --> 25:05.071
What did you do?

25:05.104 --> 25:06.205
This wasn't us.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.541
No, it was me.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.076
Sophe is being hosted

25:10.109 --> 25:12.545
on Ratchet's network.
For the time being, anyway.

25:12.579 --> 25:13.980
I have an investigation to run,
Mr. Tanner.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.948
So do we.
You'll have access to Sophe.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.550
Interview anyone you want.

25:17.584 --> 25:20.086
Just try to stay
out of our way.

25:20.119 --> 25:21.954
Just calm down, people.

25:21.988 --> 25:25.558
It's a Band-Aid. Ratchet's
only hosting us for eight hours.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.093
And after that?
There is no "after that."

25:27.126 --> 25:29.228
I created Sophe
to find Mia's killer,

25:29.261 --> 25:31.664
and I refuse
to let him just go free.

25:31.698 --> 25:33.700
So I don't care what you do
or how you do it.

25:33.733 --> 25:35.034
We have to fix this, all right?
Let's go.

25:39.806 --> 25:40.907
Users are realizing we're
back up. Submissions aren't

25:40.940 --> 25:41.908
at their pre-outage levels,

25:41.941 --> 25:43.075
but they're growing.

25:43.109 --> 25:45.044
They like us.
They really like us.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.013
What about Mia's investigation?
Uh, we got

25:47.046 --> 25:48.280
a couple more photos of
people wearing the sweater.

25:48.314 --> 25:50.282
Which won't matter
if Sophe goes down again

25:50.316 --> 25:52.318
when we're kicked off
Ratchet's servers.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.888
We have to find out who's behind
the DDoS attack and stop it.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.057
That means the JavaWell case
has to come first.

25:58.090 --> 26:01.828
Hey, uh, remember how users were
obsessing about the JavaWell app

26:01.861 --> 26:03.730
before we went down?
They're back at it.

26:03.763 --> 26:05.798
SARA: I still don't understand
how that's important.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.767
Well, uh, CoffeeCrazy78

26:07.800 --> 26:09.869
says the app automatically
connects phones that have it

26:09.902 --> 26:11.804
if they're within ten
feet of each other.
TANNER: That's like Airport.

26:11.838 --> 26:14.340
People don't notice phones
are being synced anymore.

26:14.373 --> 26:16.108
Wait, got another message here.
"Check the user logs

26:16.142 --> 26:18.110
from the suspects' phones."
This one's from...

26:18.144 --> 26:19.946
DearPrudence95.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.347
TARIQ:
We won't have to check anything.

26:21.380 --> 26:24.984
User CityGal154
quit JavaWell last week,

26:25.017 --> 26:26.352
but they haven't revoked
her admin access.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.187
She just submitted
the data logs from that night.

26:30.356 --> 26:35.261
Ben, Mason, and Faith all
told us that Ron was alive

26:35.294 --> 26:36.963
when they left.
But-but these records,

26:36.996 --> 26:38.831
they prove that
all three of them

26:38.865 --> 26:42.334
were within ten feet of
Ron when he was killed.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.036
They've all been lying.

26:44.070 --> 26:45.772
And now we have
the evidence.

26:45.805 --> 26:46.973
Go.

26:47.006 --> 26:47.774
Yeah.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.386
I messed up.

27:00.419 --> 27:02.021
What do you mean? What happened?

27:02.054 --> 27:05.057
This morning, I went
to get something to eat.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.159
And when I came back,
Prudence was at my computer.
And she wouldn't tell me what

27:07.193 --> 27:09.862
she was doing on it, but...
it was right before the attack.

27:09.896 --> 27:12.198
If I ask her about it, she'll
think that I'm accusing her

27:12.231 --> 27:14.233
of something or that I
don't trust her. Which I do!

27:14.266 --> 27:17.236
It's just a little suspicious,
but it's not that suspicious.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.939
This is a really weird
conversation to be having

27:19.972 --> 27:21.107
with my boss, isn't it?

27:21.140 --> 27:24.944
Yes, but I'm rolling with it.

27:24.977 --> 27:28.047
Things are kind of undefined
and awkward

27:28.080 --> 27:29.916
and you don't want
to mess it up.

27:29.949 --> 27:30.917
I get it.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.284
So, how about this?

27:32.318 --> 27:34.020
I will talk to Prudence
when I get back

27:34.053 --> 27:35.955
and I will leave you out of it.

27:35.988 --> 27:39.325
Unless Prudence is some sort
of stealth JavaWell plant,

27:39.358 --> 27:41.027
which I highly doubt,

27:41.060 --> 27:42.328
I think we're fine.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.030
From now on, just, uh,

27:44.063 --> 27:45.932
keep your terminal locked, yeah?

27:45.965 --> 27:48.167
Yeah.
And maybe...

27:48.200 --> 27:49.902
define your relationships
a little better?

27:49.936 --> 27:51.070
Yeah.

27:51.103 --> 27:53.105
Thank you.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.175
CAVANAUGH:
These are data logs

27:56.208 --> 27:58.110
from the JavaWell app.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.446
They prove
you were within ten feet

28:00.479 --> 28:02.181
of Ron Howland when he died.

28:02.214 --> 28:03.850
You all were.

28:03.883 --> 28:05.384
You've been lying to us.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.919
Okay, so we lied.

28:06.953 --> 28:08.454
Doesn't mean I killed him.

28:08.487 --> 28:12.191
No, but I showed these to Faith
and Mason and, guess what,

28:12.224 --> 28:13.860
they gave you up.

28:13.893 --> 28:15.327
They said you got
in a fight with Ron.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.963
It got physical.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.364
Then you murdered him.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.867
It's a fun story,

28:20.900 --> 28:23.002
but that's all it is.

28:24.370 --> 28:26.873
I'd like a lawyer now.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.976
No. No, there's no way Ben
and Faith would turn on me.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.110
But they did.

28:35.982 --> 28:39.151
You know, I did this prisoner's
dilemma experiment in college.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.953
And the thing
I learned is,

28:40.987 --> 28:42.488
if you want to win,

28:42.521 --> 28:44.991
you stay silent.

28:45.024 --> 28:47.193
So I'll be exercising
that right.

28:49.495 --> 28:51.430
Thanks.

28:52.999 --> 28:55.201
Of course they turned on me.

28:55.234 --> 28:59.305
Did you expect
anything different?

28:59.338 --> 29:03.109
They were always gonna do
what was best for them.

29:03.142 --> 29:06.913
(sniffles)
It was an accident.

29:06.946 --> 29:10.282
Why don't you tell us
what happened that night, Faith.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.084
(sniffles)

29:12.118 --> 29:14.286
We were all wasted.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.023
Are you out of your mind,
writing a memo like that?

29:17.056 --> 29:19.358
There's a reason that
Google fired that guy.

29:19.391 --> 29:21.994
The customers won't stand
for it, especially

29:22.028 --> 29:24.030
not our wealthy,
liberal ones!

29:24.063 --> 29:26.532
Calm down, all right?
You're overreacting.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.366
FAITH: Oh, don't
patronize me.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.168
You know what
happened with Uber.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.037
Do you want to destroy
this company?

29:31.070 --> 29:33.005
Wait. Wait, I'm-I'm sorry.

29:33.039 --> 29:35.541
You actually wrote...
that stupid think piece?

29:35.574 --> 29:37.143
Are you joking?

29:37.176 --> 29:38.444
Oh, come on.

29:38.477 --> 29:40.012
It's no big deal.

29:40.046 --> 29:41.013
We've talked about this.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.015
What you do reflects on us.

29:43.049 --> 29:45.952
FAITH: This is the kind of thing
that could kill the IPO.

29:45.985 --> 29:48.087
The entire company!
Faith,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.489
chill. I know that
your feelings are hurt.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.492
Maybe just take some time,
think about what you're saying.

29:53.525 --> 29:56.295
No. We're going to talk
about this.
Wha... Hey, let go of me.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.297
We're gonna talk about...
Let go, Faith. Do you know
how much this shirt costs?!

29:58.330 --> 29:59.966
(both grunting)

29:59.999 --> 30:01.167
Oh, my God!
BEN: Ron!

30:05.471 --> 30:07.439
What the hell, Faith?

30:07.473 --> 30:09.308
FAITH: You saw!
I didn't mean it!

30:09.341 --> 30:11.177
BEN:
Oh, my God.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.312
(sniffles)
It was an accident.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.482
Ben thought if we got
our stories straight,

30:16.515 --> 30:18.484
everyone would think
that he just fell.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.452
The death of a founder
was bad enough.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.121
This way, we could avoid

30:22.154 --> 30:24.356
the bad press
about the memo.

30:24.390 --> 30:28.427
It would be a tragedy,
not a scandal.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.130
I didn't mean
to hurt him.

30:31.163 --> 30:33.565
(sniffles)
I just lost it.

30:33.599 --> 30:36.435
Another guy I trusted

30:36.468 --> 30:38.470
who didn't even think that
I deserved to be there.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.007
If that memo got out,
people were gonna think

30:41.040 --> 30:42.241
he was talking about me.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.012
You're really trying to sell it
as an accident?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.146
That he fell?

30:48.247 --> 30:50.182
That's what happened.

30:50.216 --> 30:52.084
Why are you still lying, Faith?

30:52.118 --> 30:53.019
I'm not.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.220
CAVANAUGH:
You are.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.122
Ron didn't fall.

30:56.155 --> 30:58.257
He was bashed in the head
with this.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.526
What the hell is that?
That's what killed him.

31:00.559 --> 31:01.593
(scoffs, sniffles)

31:01.627 --> 31:03.495
You know what,

31:03.529 --> 31:05.364
you see this?

31:05.397 --> 31:07.133
What?

31:07.166 --> 31:10.036
You see here? Here's where
the award cracked his skull.

31:10.069 --> 31:12.638
Here's the indentation
that matches perfectly.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.107
No. What? No. No.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.542
I didn't hit him.

31:16.575 --> 31:19.378
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

31:19.411 --> 31:21.280
Please, just take
these away from me.

31:22.548 --> 31:25.217
(sniffles)
Please!

31:25.251 --> 31:28.387
Either she's the best
liar I ever saw

31:28.420 --> 31:29.588
or she's telling the truth.

31:29.621 --> 31:32.291
She believed that he fell.

31:32.324 --> 31:36.295
Which means when someone hit him
over the head with that trophy,

31:36.328 --> 31:38.497
it had to be at the bottom
of the stairs.

31:40.432 --> 31:43.435
Ron had those damn awards
all over the house, right?

31:43.469 --> 31:45.137
We assumed that the murder
weapon came from upstairs,

31:45.171 --> 31:46.438
'cause that's where we found it.

31:46.472 --> 31:49.141
But what if it didn't?

31:49.175 --> 31:51.143
(exhales)

31:51.177 --> 31:53.079
Look here.

31:54.180 --> 31:56.182
Here. Look at this.

31:56.215 --> 31:58.517
This is a picture
of the awards upstairs.

31:58.550 --> 32:02.121
And this is a picture of
the award table downstairs.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.625
Look, the dates don't line up.

32:06.658 --> 32:10.196
So Ron was killed
with a 2016 award.

32:10.229 --> 32:14.333
All the awards upstairs were,
what, from '07, '08, '09.

32:14.366 --> 32:16.168
All the ones downstairs
were more recent.

32:16.202 --> 32:18.170
2014, 2015.

32:18.204 --> 32:19.638
They were all there,

32:19.671 --> 32:22.474
but Faith said Mason went
to go check on him.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.576
SARA: She had no reason
to lie about it.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.213
She thought she'd killed Ron.

32:27.246 --> 32:29.481
CAVANAUGH:
So Mason found him still alive,

32:29.515 --> 32:31.183
grabbed an award, and bashed
him over the head with it.

32:31.217 --> 32:33.085
And then tried to cover it up.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.222
My client is not
saying a word.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.458
CAVANAUGH: That's okay.
He can just listen.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.727
We know you killed Ron.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.196
I guess you guys were friends,
but there's friendship

32:44.230 --> 32:45.731
and then there's business,
right?

32:45.764 --> 32:48.734
The memo he wrote would have
destroyed your company,

32:48.767 --> 32:51.237
right before the big IPO.

32:51.270 --> 32:54.206
So after he fell,
you went to check on him.

32:54.240 --> 32:57.376
And when you realized
he was still alive,

32:57.409 --> 32:59.111
you grabbed
the first thing you saw...

33:01.180 --> 33:03.215
...one of his hackathon awards,

33:03.249 --> 33:05.184
then you finished him off
with it.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.319
And then you used it
to frame Faith.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.656
SARA: Typical
overcompensating male.

33:10.689 --> 33:12.624
Too clever by a third.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.560
That's what you've got?

33:14.593 --> 33:17.463
Really? No evidence,
no fingerprints.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.665
Your client might have been
smart enough

33:19.698 --> 33:23.635
to wipe off his prints, but...
DNA tends to stick around.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.337
You see these sharp edges?

33:25.371 --> 33:28.207
They dig in to your hands.

33:28.240 --> 33:30.542
You see any cuts?

33:30.576 --> 33:33.245
CAVANAUGH: You don't need to
cut yourself to transfer DNA.

33:33.279 --> 33:35.447
All it takes is one
or two skin cells

33:35.481 --> 33:37.516
left behind.

33:37.549 --> 33:40.386
Now how sure are you
that when we test those cells,

33:40.419 --> 33:41.520
they won't match yours?

33:51.763 --> 33:54.666
Get the D.A. in here,

33:54.700 --> 33:57.536
and we can make a deal.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.471
Ron was your friend.

33:59.505 --> 34:03.309
And he told me he wouldn't
write that damn memo.

34:03.342 --> 34:04.676
(scoffs)

34:04.710 --> 34:06.545
All he had to do was wait
for the IPO.

34:06.578 --> 34:08.547
Yeah, it was all his fault.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.483
But since we know the truth,
you can call off

34:11.517 --> 34:13.785
your denial-of-service attack
on Sophe now.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.288
What are you talking about?
SARA: You didn't want us

34:16.322 --> 34:18.590
solving the case,
so you rented a botnet

34:18.624 --> 34:21.260
to crash Sophe,
but it's over now.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.829
I don't know anything
about that.

34:23.862 --> 34:25.797
(laughs softly)

34:25.831 --> 34:28.334
Typical hysterical female.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.236
(scoffs)

34:33.472 --> 34:35.674
Any change in the traffic?

34:35.707 --> 34:37.276
Yeah, it looks like
Mason was telling the truth.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.744
JavaWell didn't launch
the attack.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.413
We only have four hours left
on Rachet's servers,

34:41.447 --> 34:43.749
and then Sophe goes down
again. If the attack

34:43.782 --> 34:46.518
wasn't about the
JavaWell case, then what?

34:46.552 --> 34:49.555
Who the hell is the
ghost in the machine?

34:50.756 --> 34:53.359
Hey, boss?

34:53.392 --> 34:56.362
In the middle of blaming me,
did the feds ask either of you

34:56.395 --> 34:57.763
about Sophe users
in government?

34:57.796 --> 34:59.465
Yeah.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.599
Yeah.

35:00.632 --> 35:01.667
Where our users work ought

35:01.700 --> 35:03.335
to be irrelevant.

35:03.369 --> 35:04.603
Why would they care?

35:11.443 --> 35:14.813
Because they're not here
investigating the attack.

35:14.846 --> 35:17.883
(phone ringing)

35:17.916 --> 35:19.718
Everything all right, Alex?

35:19.751 --> 35:23.555
We looked into the FBI's
Sophe investigation.

35:23.589 --> 35:25.357
And?

35:25.391 --> 35:27.693
Well, there isn't one.

35:27.726 --> 35:29.628
Not officially, anyway.

35:29.661 --> 35:33.699
Alex, I got guys in suits
at my terminals right now.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.767
Well, there is no
FBI investigation,

35:35.801 --> 35:38.537
but the Bureau is sometimes used
by another agency.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.806
Let me guess.

35:40.839 --> 35:44.510
Begins with an "N"
and ends with an "A"?

35:44.543 --> 35:47.346
Is there any reason the NSA
would be interested in you?

35:47.379 --> 35:49.315
Yeah, we had a case
a couple weeks ago,

35:49.348 --> 35:51.583
and a source helped us out.

35:51.617 --> 35:55.921
Then Sophe gets attacked,
the NSA comes in to investigate.

35:55.954 --> 35:58.624
That's a pretty big coincidence,
Jeffrey.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.926
That was the plan.

36:00.959 --> 36:04.363
The NSA took Sophe down
so that they can gain access.

36:04.396 --> 36:05.864
Well, here's what I know.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.500
If the NSA wants Sophe off-line,

36:08.534 --> 36:10.502
it's staying off-line.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.737
Uh-huh. We'll see about that.

36:15.741 --> 36:18.710
You needed me?
Come here.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.647
Can you get remote access to
Sophe and cover your tracks?

36:21.680 --> 36:24.516
What do you think?
Good. I got
a new job for you.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.452
For something
with such grand artistic merit,

36:26.485 --> 36:28.787
death metal is sure
widely hated.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.589
Because it's not controllable.
Besides, being hated

36:30.622 --> 36:32.658
by the powers that be
is a badge of honor.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.526
Anything new here?

36:34.560 --> 36:35.861
We're still getting
sustained traffic

36:35.894 --> 36:37.763
of over 600
gigabits per second.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.798
Ratchet's servers are
handling it for now.

36:39.831 --> 36:43.269
(alarm blares)

36:43.302 --> 36:44.736
What the hell?

36:44.770 --> 36:45.904
Did the attack
take down Ratchet?

36:45.937 --> 36:48.707
No, this is just Sophe.

36:48.740 --> 36:50.809
What's going on?

36:50.842 --> 36:52.944
I thought you had, uh, three
more hours on Ratchet's server.

36:52.978 --> 36:54.646
When Driscoll got here,
she showed us her badge,

36:54.680 --> 36:55.714
and you didn't.
Why is that?

36:56.982 --> 36:59.251
Do you have a point,
Mr. Tanner?

36:59.285 --> 37:00.886
No. I'm just making
conversation.

37:00.919 --> 37:02.888
Hey,

37:02.921 --> 37:05.257
you guys hear
about the NSA's website?

37:05.291 --> 37:07.793
I guess that we're not the
only ones having a bad day.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.962
What the hell?

37:10.996 --> 37:12.698
TANNER:
Kind of embarrassing, though.

37:12.731 --> 37:16.302
You know, when the country's
top computer spies get owned.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.837
Let's play out
a little hypothetical.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.706
Let's say that there
was an agency

37:20.739 --> 37:26.545
who, uh, was paranoid
about leakers. See,

37:26.578 --> 37:28.314
some of their own people
had gone rogue.

37:28.347 --> 37:29.748
People with names like--
I don't know--

37:29.781 --> 37:31.583
Snowden and Manning.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.585
Let's say that
they thought

37:33.619 --> 37:36.988
that someone else
had gone rogue, and contacted

37:37.022 --> 37:40.859
a site like Sophe, but
they didn't know why.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.028
I bet they would do
anything in their power

37:43.061 --> 37:45.331
to figure out
who that leaker was,

37:45.364 --> 37:48.334
including setting up
a denial-of-service attack

37:48.367 --> 37:51.737
so they could swoop in
and... investigate.

37:51.770 --> 37:54.973
It's very creative,
Mr. Tanner.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.976
You've got a career
in airport novels.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.845
TANNER:
Now, if all that were true,

37:59.878 --> 38:02.013
if the NSA directed
all that traffic

38:02.047 --> 38:04.750
directly at Sophe
to cripple it,

38:04.783 --> 38:06.885
then wouldn't it be smart
if Sophe then

38:06.918 --> 38:11.757
directed all of its traffic
at the NSA site?

38:11.790 --> 38:13.925
Give it a taste
of its own medicine.

38:17.062 --> 38:20.632
Something like that would take
the NSA site right down.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.601
But...

38:22.634 --> 38:24.903
if the NSA really was

38:24.936 --> 38:27.606
behind all of this,
they could just

38:27.639 --> 38:29.775
stop the attack at any time.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.077
And I hear that you used to
play ball with the government.

38:33.745 --> 38:36.882
I do a lot of things
differently now.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.618
(phone chimes, vibrates)

38:39.651 --> 38:42.654
Look at that.

38:42.688 --> 38:45.924
The NSA site's back up
and running.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.760
Looks like the attack
has been shut down,

38:48.794 --> 38:50.396
which means
we can probably

38:50.429 --> 38:51.730
get Sophe back
online now, too.

38:53.665 --> 38:56.768
(scoffs) Pack it up.
We're done here.

38:59.805 --> 39:02.774
The United States government
thanks you for your cooperation.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.382
Pleasure doing business
with you!

39:10.416 --> 39:11.817
SARA:
So this whole thing

39:11.850 --> 39:14.085
was about the suicide game
investigation?

39:14.119 --> 39:17.823
That user that gave us
information on microdots?

39:17.856 --> 39:19.157
It seems like it,
but if they really think

39:19.190 --> 39:20.826
that's the leaker,

39:20.859 --> 39:22.661
they're not gonna
give up that easily.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.696
The NSA didn't get
what they were looking for.

39:24.730 --> 39:27.799
They'll be looking for leverage
so that we'll cooperate.

39:27.833 --> 39:30.902
It's not over.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.742
(sighs)

39:36.775 --> 39:39.177
This is probably not what
you imagined from your day off.

39:39.210 --> 39:43.114
You mean it's not
always like this? Bummer.

39:45.684 --> 39:49.721
I, um, wanted to talk
to you about something.

39:49.755 --> 39:53.191
I heard that you were
on Josh's computer this morning.

39:53.224 --> 39:56.127
(loud death metal blaring)

39:56.161 --> 39:57.863
It won't stop!
What the hell?

39:57.896 --> 39:59.130
TARIQ:
Aren't you supposed to be

39:59.164 --> 40:00.966
some kind of genius?
(music stops)

40:00.999 --> 40:02.901
Don't fear chaos, Josh!

40:02.934 --> 40:04.736
(whoops)

40:04.770 --> 40:06.004
That's what you were
doing on his computer?

40:06.037 --> 40:07.873
You were playing a prank?

40:07.906 --> 40:10.842
Yeah, I'm just trying
to get Josh out of his shell.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.878
I thought you
were a file clerk.

40:12.911 --> 40:14.713
For now.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.449
I mean, I tried working at
a couple start-ups, but

40:17.483 --> 40:20.018
the dudebro contingent's
really a drag, so...

40:20.051 --> 40:22.854
Well, you shouldn't give up
on the tech world just yet.

40:22.888 --> 40:23.989
We're not all bad.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.758
Here's my number.

40:26.792 --> 40:28.026
If you ever want to talk.
(phone chimes, vibrates)

40:29.761 --> 40:32.063
TARIQ:
Ah, man, she totally got you.

40:32.097 --> 40:34.933
Whatever.
You gonna go over there
and talk to her or what?

40:34.966 --> 40:36.868
Sara talked to her.
It's fine.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.036
Dear Prudence,
Josh wants to talk to you.

40:38.069 --> 40:39.738
I got you. Don't worry.

40:39.771 --> 40:41.039
First Picard, and now this?

40:41.072 --> 40:42.741
Is there no end
to your betrayal?

40:42.774 --> 40:44.676
I got more in store.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.013
What's the
matter, Josh?

40:48.046 --> 40:51.883
You scared of me?
No.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.920
Is this, um...

40:54.953 --> 40:56.955
about that "girlfriend"
thing from earlier?

40:56.988 --> 40:59.758
Look, I-I just don't want
things to get weird,

40:59.791 --> 41:02.060
or, like, pressurey or whatever.

41:02.093 --> 41:04.062
What, do you hate that term?

41:04.095 --> 41:06.031
'Cause I don't.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.701
I'm-I'm cool with it.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.940
TARIQ: Look alive, Hive.
We're ready here!

41:14.973 --> 41:18.209
We're all set to port Sophe from
Ratchet's servers to our own.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.811
Well done.
I don't want to be dependent

41:19.845 --> 41:21.813
on Vikram for another second.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.782
(computers whooshing)

41:23.815 --> 41:26.117
(applause and cheering)

41:27.986 --> 41:30.221
And traffic is normal.

41:30.255 --> 41:32.558
The denial-of-service
attack is over.

41:32.591 --> 41:35.126
We've lost some users, but if
we don't have any more outages,

41:35.160 --> 41:36.962
our growth should resume apace.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.797
Well done, everyone. Now,

41:38.830 --> 41:40.966
back to work.
(phone ringing)

41:40.999 --> 41:44.235
Mike, you surviving your time
with the lawyers?

41:44.269 --> 41:47.773
Yeah, that sounds fascinating.
My day?

41:47.806 --> 41:49.941
Well, you know what?
It's been interesting.

41:49.975 --> 41:52.043
We'll have to get into it
over a drink sometime.

41:52.077 --> 41:53.945
Okay, stay on it.

41:53.979 --> 41:56.014
If the leaker contacts
Sophe again, we need to know.

41:58.083 --> 42:01.920
(goat bleating)

42:06.024 --> 42:08.827
(evidence alert blaring)

42:08.860 --> 42:10.829
What is it?

42:10.862 --> 42:12.998
It's about Mia.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.266
A user in San Francisco said
he spotted a homeless man

42:15.300 --> 42:17.035
wearing a sweater
like the one

42:17.068 --> 42:18.604
in Mia's video.
A homeless man?

42:18.637 --> 42:20.606
Yeah, the user says
he asked him where he got it,

42:20.639 --> 42:22.340
but the guy just said he found
it in the trash somewhere.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.910
In the trash? Where?
TARIQ: He doesn't know.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.578
He got spooked and left.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.847
Let's set up a meeting with this
user, see what we can learn.

42:28.880 --> 42:30.616
What are you thinking?

42:30.649 --> 42:32.350
Well, why would anyone
throw away an expensive sweater?

42:32.383 --> 42:33.952
SARA:
You wouldn't,

42:33.985 --> 42:35.921
unless you thought
it would implicate you.

42:37.989 --> 42:40.125
He knows we're looking for him.

42:44.930 --> 42:47.365
The killer's on Sophe.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.167
He's watching us.
