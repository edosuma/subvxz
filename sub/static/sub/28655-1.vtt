01:32.693 --> 01:33.592
- Al?

01:40.434 --> 01:41.300
Al!

01:42.970 --> 01:43.836
Al.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.607
Al, Al.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.510
Huh!

01:51.512 --> 01:54.012
- Okay, but I haven't
finished writing the story.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.118
"The Ultimate Weapon"
by Albert Flinch.

02:00.187 --> 02:01.420
Chapter one.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.022
Our story begins
30 years from now.

02:05.159 --> 02:06.558
He was stationed in Area 51

02:07.528 --> 02:09.261
but he would be back for it

02:09.263 --> 02:11.797
because contained within
the pages of that book

02:11.799 --> 02:15.167
was all he needed to
destroy the world.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.068
- Al!

02:17.872 --> 02:19.938
No, Al.
No.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.074
- Sorry, but that's
all I've got.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.578
Petie, I told you I wasn't done.

02:28.516 --> 02:29.781
- Al, ahhh.

02:29.783 --> 02:31.717
- I can't take this,
it's your magic orb.

02:35.156 --> 02:35.855
- Al, Al.

02:35.856 --> 02:36.555
- Oh you
think it'll help me

02:36.557 --> 02:37.723
finish writing my story?

02:37.725 --> 02:38.924
- Yawwwh.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.926
- I'll finish writing
it tomorrow, okay?

02:40.928 --> 02:42.060
I promise.

02:42.062 --> 02:43.162
But for now...

02:55.009 --> 02:56.074
- Al?

02:56.076 --> 02:57.075
Al!

02:57.077 --> 02:58.076
Al?

02:58.078 --> 02:58.944
- Petie!

02:59.914 --> 03:00.879
Stay right there!

03:00.881 --> 03:01.847
- Al!
- Look out!

03:01.849 --> 03:03.882
- Al, Al!
- Petie!

03:03.884 --> 03:04.783
No, Petie!

03:05.786 --> 03:06.685
No!

03:10.691 --> 03:11.590
Petie.

03:13.327 --> 03:14.393
No, no.

03:16.797 --> 03:20.632
No, Petie, no.

03:22.069 --> 03:22.968
Petie!

03:30.344 --> 03:33.111
How you doing,
buddy, sleep okay?

04:13.254 --> 04:14.820
Ow.

04:14.822 --> 04:15.721
Ow.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.488
Ow.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.628
Okay, Hemingway,
today is the day.

04:26.567 --> 04:28.100
Okay listen to me, Hemingway.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.069
You're in charge
while I'm gone, okay?

04:31.071 --> 04:32.571
Got that?

04:32.573 --> 04:34.239
All righty.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.107
Give me five.

04:36.777 --> 04:37.676
All right.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.791
I'm going, I'm going.

04:52.793 --> 04:55.027
Hang on, hold your horses.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.298
Okay.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.067
Here we go.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.068
Here we go.

05:04.872 --> 05:05.771
I'm going.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.380
Okay, I can do this.

05:16.383 --> 05:17.616
I can do this.

05:18.619 --> 05:19.685
Liv needs me.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.755
Livvie.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.696
I can do this.

05:31.598 --> 05:32.497
I can do.

06:48.342 --> 06:50.409
â™ª

08:12.893 --> 08:13.792
- Dammit.

08:56.937 --> 08:57.836
Albert?

09:02.609 --> 09:04.209
Albert, I know you're in there!

09:11.652 --> 09:12.551
Albert!

09:14.555 --> 09:16.254
- Go
away, we're closed.

09:18.292 --> 09:19.190
We open when I'm awake.

09:19.192 --> 09:21.960
- It's me, Liv.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.531
Your offspring.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.910
- Oh my God, Livvie, it is you.

09:41.515 --> 09:43.515
- So are you gonna
let me in, or?

09:43.517 --> 09:44.783
- Yeah, please, come in.

09:45.719 --> 09:46.618
Come in.

09:51.792 --> 09:53.425
Oh, look at you.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.262
The last time I
saw you, you were,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.831
now you're so tall

09:59.833 --> 10:01.566
and you look great.

10:04.671 --> 10:06.538
Welcome to the Omega
Used Bookstore.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.214
- So do you live here?

10:19.386 --> 10:20.685
- Yeah.

10:20.687 --> 10:22.253
I have an apartment out back.

10:22.255 --> 10:23.588
- What, this way?

10:23.590 --> 10:24.522
- Yeah.

10:26.093 --> 10:26.992
Yeah.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.829
You ought to check out
my UFO section out front.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.030
It's award-winning.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.498
People come from
all over to see it.

10:34.635 --> 10:35.934
It's a pretty huge
selection, huh?

10:35.936 --> 10:38.036
- Do you even get
any customers out here?

10:38.038 --> 10:40.605
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
We get a lot of people heading off area 51

10:40.607 --> 10:41.873
looking for UFO books.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.476
I have a great
selection out front.

10:44.478 --> 10:46.211
And it's probably the best
selection in the city,

10:46.213 --> 10:47.178
probably United
States, you know.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.446
Something we're proud of.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.448
You know, people come
from all over to see it.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.284
- So this way?

10:54.655 --> 10:55.920
- No, no, no, it's uh,

10:55.922 --> 10:56.921
hmmm, okay.

11:00.727 --> 11:02.260
- Where's your apartment?

11:02.262 --> 11:05.764
- Um, well it's more like a
studio apartment, you know.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.532
'Cause you gotta
keep the real estate

11:07.534 --> 11:09.668
for the business aspect
of things, right.

11:15.509 --> 11:17.008
- What, this is it?

11:17.010 --> 11:18.009
- Yeah.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.411
That's more like a bedroom.

11:20.614 --> 11:22.414
- This isn't like
a bedroom at all.

11:22.416 --> 11:23.682
- Yeah well I have a bad back

11:23.684 --> 11:25.617
and the cot is
actually quite firm

11:25.619 --> 11:27.819
and it serves its purpose.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.287
- Just a microwave?

11:29.289 --> 11:31.056
- It's not just any microwave.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.824
I mean look, I could
cook a whole turkey

11:32.826 --> 11:33.858
if you wanted.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.127
Popcorn, defrost, multi purpose.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.697
- And where's your fridge?

11:40.100 --> 11:41.132
- I don't need one.

11:43.637 --> 11:46.137
- What, you drink warm beer?

11:46.139 --> 11:48.606
- Yeah well apparently
if you drink warm liquids

11:48.608 --> 11:50.775
it absorbs the body better
so I get drunk faster.

11:50.777 --> 11:52.310
- No, it's just gross.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.478
- Okay.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.846
- What do you do for food?

11:54.848 --> 11:56.715
- I manage.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.584
I'm breathing, I'm
moving, I'm alive.

12:03.957 --> 12:04.856
Wait.

12:06.927 --> 12:07.826
- Oh my god.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.236
Albert!

12:18.238 --> 12:19.838
- I like soup.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.439
- Clearly.

12:21.441 --> 12:22.607
Is this all you eat?

12:23.510 --> 12:24.676
- Yeah, but you'd be surprised.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.912
I mean there's chicken and beef.

12:27.914 --> 12:30.181
Look at this, it's
vitamin A and C and D.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.116
- Where do you get
your water from?

12:31.118 --> 12:32.250
You don't have a kitchen.

12:33.153 --> 12:34.018
- The sink.

12:35.155 --> 12:37.122
- What sink, you
don't have a kitchen.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.065
- Tada.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.933
Welcome to the best drinking
water in Lincoln County.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.069
- Where's your shower?

12:54.007 --> 12:56.875
- See, what the Japanese, they
do these freestanding showers

12:56.877 --> 12:59.043
where you don't need a tub
or a sink, or anything.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.345
It's quite efficient.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.281
Livvie, please don't go.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.317
Stop, Livvie, please, please.

13:06.319 --> 13:07.619
Listen.

13:07.621 --> 13:10.188
I just want a
moment of your time

13:10.190 --> 13:11.623
so we could talk and I could see

13:11.625 --> 13:13.158
what you've been up to
for, it's been seven years.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.927
I just wanna know how you been.

13:15.929 --> 13:17.395
- No.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.665
I am only here because
it was mom's dying wish

13:20.667 --> 13:22.901
for us to reconnect.

13:22.903 --> 13:25.069
But you couldn't even
go to her funeral!

13:27.574 --> 13:28.473
- I tried.

13:29.242 --> 13:30.341
I just, I couldn't.

13:30.343 --> 13:31.910
- You tried?

13:31.912 --> 13:34.412
What the hell does that
mean that you tried?

13:35.549 --> 13:36.681
- I have, um...

13:38.418 --> 13:40.819
I have an issue with...

13:41.822 --> 13:43.121
Listen, okay, um.

13:43.123 --> 13:45.089
Okay look, can I just,

13:45.091 --> 13:46.791
can you just give me
a second of your time?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.526
I'm sorry, listen, I
failed as a father,

13:48.528 --> 13:49.427
I know I did.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.764
But I'm here for you now and I just want
to take advantage of this moment so you--

13:52.766 --> 13:53.598
- No, no, no.

13:53.600 --> 13:54.899
You are not here for me.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.534
I am here for you.

13:57.904 --> 13:59.304
And now I'm leaving.

14:00.774 --> 14:01.673
- No, don't.

14:09.282 --> 14:10.782
Wait, you ride a motorcycle?

14:10.784 --> 14:13.051
Do you realize how
dangerous those things are?

14:13.053 --> 14:14.319
You can get killed.

14:14.321 --> 14:15.520
- Yeah.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.890
And people die from
cancer every single day.

14:18.892 --> 14:21.726
You cannot tell me what I
can and can't do anymore.

14:22.829 --> 14:23.995
- Listen, I care for you, okay?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.196
I don't want you to get killed.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.097
I'm your dad!

14:27.868 --> 14:29.500
- No, you are not my dad.

14:29.502 --> 14:31.569
You may be my biological father

14:31.571 --> 14:34.038
but you are not my dad.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.641
I have lived my whole
life without you

14:36.643 --> 14:38.910
and I certainly do
not need you now.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.181
Here.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.956
Are you gonna take it, or?

14:54.661 --> 14:55.560
- I uh...

14:57.597 --> 15:00.465
I have a problem going outside.

15:00.467 --> 15:01.332
- What?

15:02.702 --> 15:05.203
When's the last time
you left this bookshop?

15:07.073 --> 15:08.406
- About a year?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.707
- Holy shit.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.679
So that's why you didn't
go to mom's funeral.

16:19.679 --> 16:20.511
- Hello.

16:20.513 --> 16:22.613
- Hey, Dr. Tanner.

16:22.615 --> 16:23.815
It's Liv.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.384
I know it's been a
really long time, but,

16:26.386 --> 16:28.653
I have a huge favor to ask you.

17:38.525 --> 17:39.424
- Hey there.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.093
- Hey.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.300
- You work here?

17:49.302 --> 17:50.201
- Yeah, yeah.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.706
- Pretty sizeable establishment
for the middle of nowhere.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.041
- Yeah.

17:57.043 --> 18:00.378
We get the odd tourist
heading out to Area 51.

18:05.385 --> 18:06.350
- Name's Sherwood.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.356
- Nice to meet you.

18:14.027 --> 18:16.094
- Yeah, normally you
would fist bump me

18:16.096 --> 18:17.095
and tell me your name.

18:17.097 --> 18:17.929
- Oh, like that.

18:17.931 --> 18:18.830
- Poofff.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.033
I like to blow things up.

18:22.035 --> 18:22.934
- Oh.

18:25.638 --> 18:26.804
- Your name?

18:26.806 --> 18:29.040
- Uh, Albert, Albert.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.511
Have you been here before?

18:35.482 --> 18:36.881
- Can't say that I have.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.553
- You heading over to Area 51?

18:44.090 --> 18:45.256
- I work out that way.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.692
- Oh, yeah, what do you do?

18:58.204 --> 18:59.537
- I'd tell you,

19:03.276 --> 19:05.109
but I'm not going to.

19:13.853 --> 19:18.055
Let's just say I'm not
at liberty to discuss it

19:19.225 --> 19:20.424
for your own safety.

19:22.228 --> 19:23.895
- You're messing with me, right?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.764
- No.

19:27.867 --> 19:28.766
- No?

19:30.303 --> 19:33.604
- What I can tell
you is that what I do

19:34.941 --> 19:38.609
will have a global impact.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.146
- Whoah.

19:42.148 --> 19:43.114
Sounds important.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.717
You know, it's funny
you said that, actually,

19:46.719 --> 19:48.953
just yesterday I read
this book on this,

19:48.955 --> 19:50.788
the simple effects
of household products

19:50.790 --> 19:52.023
and how they have
a global impact

19:52.025 --> 19:53.791
and how they affect
the environment.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.993
I think, I'm gonna think
it's right up your alley.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.396
Anything that sounds
interesting to you at all?

19:59.399 --> 20:00.665
- Yeah.

20:00.667 --> 20:01.499
- Yeah, yeah.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.733
I mean for nonfic,

20:02.735 --> 20:05.002
for nonfiction it's
actually not a bad read.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.772
And literally, it's
right over here.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.075
Now the author, she's
an unknown but she's,

20:11.077 --> 20:12.810
you could finish this in a--

20:17.016 --> 20:17.915
Okay.

20:23.156 --> 20:24.055
Sherwood.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.525
Sherwood, Sherwood, Sherwood.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.329
That's right about,

20:31.331 --> 20:32.797
right about here.

20:38.738 --> 20:39.804
Atomic chess?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.139
This isn't one of my books.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.814
Why would he leave this here?

20:52.785 --> 20:56.554
Sherwood, doomsday
weapon, atomic chess,

20:56.556 --> 20:57.922
all of it, you know?

20:58.858 --> 20:59.890
It's like a,

21:03.162 --> 21:04.428
it's like a picture
that's out of focus

21:04.430 --> 21:06.297
and I just can't, I just
can't see it, you know?

21:06.299 --> 21:07.982
It's there.

21:07.983 --> 21:09.666
It's right there on the tip of
my tongue but I can't see it.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.507
The deja vu, do you
guys get deja vu?

21:36.129 --> 21:37.561
- The test is already scheduled.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.797
- General, there are too
many unknown variables.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.565
You can't go through with it.

21:41.567 --> 21:43.034
- What are you
telling me, Dr. Lin?

21:43.036 --> 21:44.568
You want me to
postpone the test?

21:44.570 --> 21:46.270
- I'm saying that
it's too powerful.

21:46.272 --> 21:48.339
This weapon should
never be tested.

21:48.341 --> 21:50.441
- So you want
me to just put it out there

21:50.443 --> 21:52.276
on the battlefield
and hope for the best?

21:52.278 --> 21:54.278
- No, sir.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.881
The Goliath weapon should
never be detonated.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.418
Once detonated, it'll create
an infinite chain reaction

22:00.420 --> 22:02.687
that will result in
global annihilation.

22:03.790 --> 22:05.356
- Why wasn't I told
about this until now?

22:05.358 --> 22:06.991
- Because Sherwood,

22:08.194 --> 22:10.394
Dr. Russell withheld
information from me.

22:11.564 --> 22:13.364
But according to
my calculations,

22:14.667 --> 22:17.034
the antimatter explosion
will create a black hole

22:17.036 --> 22:19.537
that will consume this planet.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.805
- That's not possible.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.175
- It is now.

22:25.578 --> 22:27.845
Sherwood's crazy, general.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.014
You need to terminate
this project.

22:51.938 --> 22:52.803
- Al?

22:55.174 --> 22:56.040
Eh?

22:57.477 --> 22:58.342
Al?

22:59.846 --> 23:00.644
Al!

23:01.647 --> 23:02.880
- Not now, buddy.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.882
Maybe later, okay?

23:04.884 --> 23:05.783
- Al!

23:06.786 --> 23:08.018
Al.

23:08.020 --> 23:09.620
Al.

23:09.622 --> 23:12.423
- Okay, but I haven't
finished writing the story.

23:13.493 --> 23:16.761
"The Ultimate Weapon"
by Albert Flinch.

23:16.763 --> 23:17.962
Chapter one.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.431
- Name's Sherwood.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.401
- But he
would be back for it

23:23.403 --> 23:26.237
because contained within
the pages of that book

23:26.239 --> 23:30.775
was all he needed to
destroy the world.

23:30.777 --> 23:35.579
- What I do will
have a global impact.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.782
- I can't take this,
this is your magic orb.

23:37.784 --> 23:38.682
- Al, Al.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.653
Al.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.822
- Tell you what, I'll finish
writing it tomorrow, okay?

23:44.824 --> 23:45.890
I promise.

23:47.960 --> 23:48.793
- Al, Al!

23:48.795 --> 23:49.927
- Petie, Petie!

23:49.929 --> 23:50.961
Petie!

23:50.963 --> 23:51.862
No, Petie!

23:52.765 --> 23:53.664
No!

24:35.141 --> 24:36.040
Sherwood!

24:41.380 --> 24:42.279
No.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.116
No, I'm dreaming.

24:47.053 --> 24:48.519
I'm dreaming.

24:48.521 --> 24:49.553
I must be dreaming.

24:50.957 --> 24:51.889
I'm not dreaming.

24:53.493 --> 24:54.725
Look at me.

24:54.727 --> 24:56.961
Tell me, tell me I'm not crazy.

24:57.763 --> 24:58.996
Look at me.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.064
Am I losing my mind?

25:01.567 --> 25:02.800
I'm dreaming, right?

25:02.802 --> 25:03.834
This can't be real.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.236
It's impossible.

25:06.439 --> 25:08.005
Things like this don't
happen in real life, right?

25:08.007 --> 25:08.806
This is...

25:47.513 --> 25:48.412
- Hello?

25:51.217 --> 25:52.116
Is anyone here?

25:55.187 --> 25:56.086
Albert?

26:01.794 --> 26:02.693
Hello?

26:02.694 --> 26:03.593
- Oh my god, I
thought you were him.

26:03.596 --> 26:04.428
- Albert.

26:04.430 --> 26:05.262
- He's real.

26:05.264 --> 26:06.363
- Excuse me?

26:06.365 --> 26:07.831
- He's coming back,
what am I gonna do?

26:07.833 --> 26:08.766
- Who's coming back?

26:08.768 --> 26:10.868
- We gotta tell someone,
you gotta help me.

26:10.870 --> 26:13.070
- We gotta call
- That's why someone called for me.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.538
- Homeland Security,
FBI, CIA, the military.

26:14.540 --> 26:15.339
You name it, we--

26:15.341 --> 26:16.473
- I see, and why is that?

26:16.475 --> 26:17.808
- Because I don't have a phone.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.477
Is that a phone?
- No, it's, that's for my own personal use.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.446
Albert, why is it that we need
to call Homeland Security?

26:22.448 --> 26:23.814
I don't understand.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.516
- You're wasting time, he's
gonna be back any second.

26:25.518 --> 26:26.250
Do you understand?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.184
- Who, who is coming?

26:27.186 --> 26:28.385
- Sherwood, he needs this book.

26:28.387 --> 26:29.853
- Albert, I'm sorry.

26:29.855 --> 26:31.522
I'm having a real hard
time understanding, okay?

26:31.524 --> 26:32.923
I need you to take
a deep breath.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.925
- I'm breathing.
- You're doing great, Albert, all right?

26:34.927 --> 26:36.427
I'm a psychologist.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.595
I'm Dr. Tanner.

26:37.597 --> 26:39.697
Your daughter Liv was --
- Wait, wait.

26:39.698 --> 26:41.798
Wait, wait, wait, I just have to destroy
the book. That's it, it's simple.

26:41.801 --> 26:44.201
Hey do you have like a match or something?
- No, I don't.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.137
Albert, why do you
wanna burn that book?

26:47.139 --> 26:48.706
- So he can't destroy
the world, that's why.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.307
- Who, who, this Sherwood?
- Sherwood, yes.

26:50.309 --> 26:51.942
- What makes you think he's
gonna destroy the world?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.744
- Because that's the plan.
That's what I wrote.

26:53.746 --> 26:54.712
- I don't understand.

26:54.714 --> 26:55.546
You wrote what?

26:55.548 --> 26:56.480
- Listen, Sherwood.

26:56.482 --> 26:57.681
He's the villain of my story

26:57.683 --> 26:59.950
and he was just here in my
bookstore, do you get it?

26:59.952 --> 27:00.951
No, you don't.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.287
Just come.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.622
- So just so I have this clear,
Sherwood is the name of a character

27:05.625 --> 27:07.324
from a story you wrote,

27:07.326 --> 27:10.761
and he came here to visit you?

27:10.763 --> 27:13.163
- Yes, and he put
this book in my store.

27:13.165 --> 27:14.098
He hid it in there.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.966
- The book you wrote?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.601
- No.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.203
See, this is Atomic Chess.

27:19.205 --> 27:21.238
This is the book that
inspired me to write my story.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.407
And I also put Atomic
Chess into my story

27:23.409 --> 27:25.009
and it gives Sherwood the idea

27:25.011 --> 27:26.343
to create his weapons.

27:27.446 --> 27:28.512
You want more proof?

27:28.514 --> 27:29.813
I'll show you proof.

27:31.817 --> 27:32.833
Look.

27:32.834 --> 27:33.850
But Sherwood knew
he might be searched

27:33.853 --> 27:35.552
so he decided to hide the book

27:35.554 --> 27:37.121
and he had the perfect place.

27:37.123 --> 27:39.423
An out of the way bookstore
in the middle of nowhere.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.025
But he would be back for it

27:41.027 --> 27:43.327
because contained within
the pages of that book

27:43.329 --> 27:45.396
is all he needed to
destroy the world.

27:46.198 --> 27:47.564
That's the last thing I wrote

27:47.566 --> 27:49.099
and that's just what happened.

27:49.101 --> 27:53.637
I met Sherwood exactly
where the story ends.

27:53.639 --> 27:56.674
- And this is why you think
your character is real?

27:56.676 --> 27:58.142
Because his name
is Sherwood also?

27:58.144 --> 27:59.977
- Sherwood, yes, and
because he left this book

27:59.979 --> 28:00.844
in my store.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.715
- Albert, it doesn't even
mention the name Atomic Chess

28:04.717 --> 28:05.916
in your story.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.751
- Yeah but I remember
that was the name.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.387
I'm sure that was the
name of the story.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.823
I'm sure it was.

28:12.825 --> 28:16.293
- Albert, our subconscious
can be a powerful force.

28:16.295 --> 28:18.195
Sherwood is an uncommon name

28:18.197 --> 28:19.263
so I'm sure when you heard it

28:19.265 --> 28:21.065
it acted as a conduit,

28:22.435 --> 28:24.735
unlocking the memory of
the story that you wrote.

28:25.705 --> 28:27.404
- But he also had a birthmark

28:27.406 --> 28:29.139
shaped like a flame.

28:29.141 --> 28:31.041
Just like the
character in my story.

28:31.043 --> 28:32.609
- Okay, Albert, let's
put a pause button

28:32.611 --> 28:33.911
on the Sherwood
thing for a moment.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.646
Let's talk about Liv.

28:35.648 --> 28:37.381
- How do you know my daughter?

28:37.383 --> 28:39.783
- Albert, I told you.

28:39.785 --> 28:40.851
She called me.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.154
I'm a psychologist.

28:44.156 --> 28:45.589
I'm Dr. Tanner.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.159
- A psychologist?

28:49.161 --> 28:50.527
- Yes.

28:50.529 --> 28:52.963
She's very worried about you.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.765
- She's worried about me?

28:54.767 --> 28:55.666
- Yes.

28:56.769 --> 29:00.938
Albert, I'm not here to
judge you, all right?

29:02.007 --> 29:03.240
I'm here to help you.

29:06.746 --> 29:10.247
Your ex wife recently passed
away and your daughter

29:10.249 --> 29:12.516
who you haven't even
seen in years shows up.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.453
I'm sure that's dragged
up all sorts of emotions

29:16.455 --> 29:17.588
and memories for you.

29:18.691 --> 29:19.590
- Yeah.

29:20.826 --> 29:22.059
Yeah.

29:22.061 --> 29:26.096
- Sometimes, when
we have a hard time

29:26.098 --> 29:28.132
facing the choices
of our actions,

29:29.401 --> 29:31.034
we find ways of escaping them.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.004
Isolation and
alcohol have worked

29:34.006 --> 29:35.873
as coping mechanisms for you

29:35.875 --> 29:37.975
until Liv came back
into your life.

29:39.078 --> 29:42.312
And now in order to
escape those memories

29:42.314 --> 29:43.247
that have resurfaced,

29:43.249 --> 29:45.616
you've constructed this fantasy

29:45.618 --> 29:47.251
about your character being real

29:47.253 --> 29:49.286
and it's very
possible that this,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.622
this notion about your
character destroying the world

29:51.624 --> 29:54.958
actually symbolizes how your
own world is falling apart.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.997
Albert, are you taking these?

30:02.034 --> 30:04.701
Albert, this is a very
strong and powerful sedative.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.336
I mean this could be
very well the reason

30:06.338 --> 30:07.571
of what you're
experiencing right now.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.873
Hallucinations are one
of the side effects.

30:09.875 --> 30:11.642
I wouldn't suggest taking
any more of those, all right

30:11.644 --> 30:12.810
until we get this sorted out.

30:12.812 --> 30:13.710
- Okay.

30:15.414 --> 30:19.716
- Deep down, you
know there is no way

30:19.718 --> 30:21.385
that your character can be real.

30:22.488 --> 30:24.655
You know that it's not possible.

30:27.760 --> 30:29.927
Look, you can choose to
burn this book if you want

30:29.929 --> 30:32.329
and stay in this wonderland of
a world that you've created.

30:32.331 --> 30:37.167
Or you could put that book
back, face your problems head on

30:37.169 --> 30:40.070
and look forward to the
happy things in your life.

30:41.207 --> 30:42.406
Like your daughter Liv.

30:43.676 --> 30:44.541
- Yeah.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.277
Yeah.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.449
- I'm proud of you, Albert.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.885
You made a big step in
the right direction here.

30:56.455 --> 30:57.921
Now if it's all right with you

30:57.923 --> 31:00.858
I want to stop back tomorrow so
we can discuss some next steps.

31:18.644 --> 31:21.011
- They pulled the
plug on my Goliath project.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.647
- Really,
that's strange.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.316
Did they tell you why?

31:26.318 --> 31:28.752
- They said that the
project was being terminated

31:28.754 --> 31:31.321
and that my services
were no longer needed.

31:32.391 --> 31:33.957
- It's
probably political.

31:33.959 --> 31:37.194
Some guys in DC cutting
military funding.

31:37.196 --> 31:40.831
- I think someone
on this base is responsible.

31:41.667 --> 31:43.533
- No, it wasn't me.

31:43.535 --> 31:45.602
I didn't know anything about it.

31:45.604 --> 31:48.071
- You
should be more careful.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.176
Checkmate.

32:19.972 --> 32:21.605
- Relax, okay, relax.

32:22.808 --> 32:24.908
It could be anybody.

32:24.910 --> 32:26.910
Just a customer, relax.

32:32.985 --> 32:36.053
Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
Oh my god.

32:38.691 --> 32:40.057
Hey, welcome back.

32:40.059 --> 32:41.976
- Thanks.

32:41.977 --> 32:43.894
- Oh, so this is the book you want?
- That's the one I was gonna get, yeah.

32:43.896 --> 32:45.963
- Yeah well it's not a,
it's a terrible read.

32:45.965 --> 32:47.698
- Well you're
familiar with it, huh?

32:47.700 --> 32:48.665
- Fortunately, yeah.

32:48.667 --> 32:49.633
It's got terrible reviews,

32:49.635 --> 32:50.600
I wouldn't recommend it at all.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.002
- I think I'll take my chances.

32:52.004 --> 32:53.203
- Okay.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.471
Well you know there's
no price on it,

32:54.473 --> 32:55.939
let me at least get you a price.

32:55.941 --> 32:57.574
- I've got 50
dollars, that should cover it.

32:57.576 --> 32:58.909
- No, no, I wouldn't
wanna cheat you.

32:58.911 --> 33:00.844
That's not the policy here.

33:00.846 --> 33:02.312
We wanna treat everybody fairly.

33:02.314 --> 33:05.015
This just wouldn't
make any sense that,

33:05.017 --> 33:06.550
yeah so, at the very least

33:06.552 --> 33:08.118
let me get you a receipt.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.353
- It's not necessary.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.887
- You wouldn't happen
to have a lighter on you

33:10.889 --> 33:11.722
or anything, would you?

33:11.724 --> 33:13.190
- No.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.993
- Um, well, looks like
it's gonna rain out there

33:15.995 --> 33:18.862
so let me get you a bag
so it doesn't get wet.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.330
- I really don't need a bag.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.799
- Let me ask you.

33:22.801 --> 33:25.902
You wouldn't happen to be from
Boulder, Colorado, would you?

33:25.904 --> 33:28.271
- Matter of fact, I would.

33:28.273 --> 33:29.172
- Oh.

33:30.409 --> 33:31.308
- How'd you know?

33:33.245 --> 33:34.644
- It's the accent.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.913
Let me get some bags,
they're out back.

34:17.822 --> 34:18.655
Where is he?

34:18.657 --> 34:19.922
- Hello?

34:19.925 --> 34:21.625
- Hey, hey, what's up?

34:21.627 --> 34:22.559
How are you?

34:22.561 --> 34:23.592
Hey I brought you some water.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.628
I figured you might be thirsty.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.929
- No thanks.

34:26.931 --> 34:28.364
My book.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.199
- Book, oh yeah
the book, the book.

34:30.202 --> 34:32.101
See, I was there, got the book.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.471
But I got the, when I went to
get the bag I forgot the book.

34:34.473 --> 34:35.705
So I, I brought the water.

34:35.706 --> 34:37.139
- Hey look, look, friend.

34:37.141 --> 34:38.141
- What?

34:38.143 --> 34:40.210
- I'm in a bit of a hurry.

34:40.212 --> 34:43.013
If you go get my book,
I'll be on my way.

34:43.014 --> 34:44.380
- Yeah, okay.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.248
It's really good quality water.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.385
I highly recommend it.

34:48.387 --> 34:49.920
'Cause the sun will
just dry you right up.

34:49.922 --> 34:51.388
- Albert.

34:51.389 --> 34:54.257
Look, I know what
you're trying to do.

34:54.259 --> 34:56.659
- You do?
- I know you're trying to keep me here.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.762
- No, no, no, I'm not trying to
keep you here. No, I just took a--

34:58.764 --> 34:59.963
- I mean I get it.

34:59.965 --> 35:01.231
You're out here in
the middle of nowhere,

35:01.233 --> 35:03.233
you got no friends.

35:03.235 --> 35:04.835
And along comes this guy.

35:04.837 --> 35:06.303
I get it.

35:06.305 --> 35:07.471
But I don't have time.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.339
You go get my
book, I'll be gone.

35:09.341 --> 35:10.440
- Yeah, the book.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.541
But, triple filtered.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.877
It's like really good quality.

35:13.879 --> 35:14.845
- Book.

35:18.183 --> 35:20.750
- Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

36:02.027 --> 36:02.926
Yes.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.432
Want a piece of me, huh?

36:09.434 --> 36:10.767
Want a piece of me,
want a piece of me?

36:10.769 --> 36:12.569
I want a piece of you!

36:14.940 --> 36:17.707
Want some of this,
huh, want some of that?

36:17.709 --> 36:19.476
I'll strike you over
the head with this.

36:19.478 --> 36:20.310
- Albert.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.012
- There you are.

36:22.014 --> 36:22.879
I was looking for you.

36:22.881 --> 36:23.813
- My book.

36:23.815 --> 36:25.315
- Yeah, book.

36:25.317 --> 36:27.317
I put the book in a bag
and it fell on the ground

36:27.319 --> 36:28.585
but, bad back.

36:28.587 --> 36:29.986
But you know I'll
get it for you.

36:29.988 --> 36:30.854
- No, I'll get it.

36:30.856 --> 36:31.788
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

36:31.790 --> 36:33.290
- Oh, that's yeah, it's just.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.592
- Albert, you
don't have a light switch?

36:43.302 --> 36:45.035
- Ah, I know who you are, okay?

36:45.037 --> 36:48.338
I know you have plans to
destroy the world, okay?

36:48.340 --> 36:51.174
I'm just gonna keep you here
for a couple of days, okay?

36:51.176 --> 36:53.543
Just two days and then
it'll all blow over.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.045
So just hang tight.

36:55.047 --> 36:57.347
- Not a very
good lock, my friend.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.682
- It was an accident.

36:58.684 --> 37:00.083
- An accident?

37:00.085 --> 37:01.851
Who've you been talking to?

37:01.853 --> 37:02.752
- No one.

37:02.754 --> 37:04.187
Okay.

37:04.189 --> 37:05.388
It was the military.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.390
They were here.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.192
And they said if you were
to come back, to call them

37:09.194 --> 37:10.860
so when I went to get
the bag for the book

37:10.862 --> 37:12.829
I called them, and
they're on their way, so.

37:15.100 --> 37:16.233
What's wrong?

37:19.705 --> 37:20.570
- The water.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.274
- Oh, you drank?

37:28.880 --> 37:30.714
- You better hope you wake
up before I do, friend.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.514
- What?

37:57.643 --> 37:58.541
Oh.

38:11.790 --> 38:12.689
- Albert?

38:27.539 --> 38:29.205
- Okay.

38:29.207 --> 38:30.106
- Albert?

38:44.890 --> 38:45.789
- Okay.

38:47.392 --> 38:48.558
All right.

38:48.560 --> 38:50.560
Yeah, you're not
going anywhere, buddy.

38:50.562 --> 38:51.528
You're not going.

38:53.465 --> 38:54.964
- Who are you?

38:54.966 --> 38:56.199
- I'm no one.

38:56.201 --> 38:57.400
I wrote you.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.703
- Okay, what are
you babbling about?

38:59.705 --> 39:01.771
- You're a scientist,
you work at Area 51,

39:01.773 --> 39:03.106
you created a doomsday weapon.

39:03.108 --> 39:05.275
Oh my god.

39:08.814 --> 39:12.449
- There is a perfectly
logical explanation for this

39:12.451 --> 39:14.417
and we will figure it out.

39:14.419 --> 39:18.054
Now Albert, I'm gonna
give you one last chance

39:18.056 --> 39:19.656
to make the right choice.

39:21.026 --> 39:23.960
You can either come over
here and let me go now or,

39:25.263 --> 39:27.497
I can let myself go later

39:27.499 --> 39:29.065
and you could pay
the consequence.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.501
- What, so you can kill
millions of people?

39:31.503 --> 39:32.402
Not gonna happen.

39:45.951 --> 39:46.850
- Albert?

39:48.754 --> 39:50.220
- Okay listen.

39:50.222 --> 39:52.255
I'm just gonna keep you here
for a couple days, okay?

39:52.257 --> 39:53.490
Till you can't
detonate the weapon.

39:53.492 --> 39:54.324
- Albert!

39:54.326 --> 39:55.158
- Oh my god.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.092
- Watch this, Albert.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.660
We're back here, come help me!

40:05.871 --> 40:07.771
- Albert?

40:09.674 --> 40:11.825
- You don't understand.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.977
He admitted it, he came back for the book!
- Oh, that's not true.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.945
I came here to buy
a book and he thinks

40:15.947 --> 40:17.614
I'm some sort of
character in a story.

40:17.616 --> 40:18.715
- He's lying!

40:18.717 --> 40:19.849
- Albert, what have you done?

40:19.851 --> 40:21.351
- What are you
doing, are you crazy?

40:21.353 --> 40:23.319
- No, albert, Albert, he is
not your character, all right?

40:23.321 --> 40:25.655
He's not, he's an
innocent person.

40:25.657 --> 40:26.823
He's a customer, stop!

40:26.825 --> 40:28.308
Albert.

40:28.309 --> 40:29.792
- I'm not good at confrontation,
okay, please don't make me do this.

40:29.795 --> 40:30.593
- Albert, all right.

40:30.595 --> 40:31.995
Let's breath, all right.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.164
Are you absolutely
positive that this is him?

40:34.166 --> 40:35.165
- One hundred percent.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.266
- Okay.

40:36.268 --> 40:37.834
This is what we need to do.

40:37.836 --> 40:40.236
I'm gonna go ahead and make a call,
all right. I'm gonna call for help.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.438
- That's a good idea, all right.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.405
- No, no, no, no, no.

40:42.407 --> 40:43.673
No, you need to stay here.

40:43.675 --> 40:46.075
You need to keep your
eyes on him, right?

40:46.077 --> 40:47.310
Make sure he doesn't escape.

40:47.312 --> 40:48.795
- Yeah.
- Right.

40:48.796 --> 40:50.279
- Go. Keep looking at him,
keep your eyes on him.

40:53.018 --> 40:53.983
- Wait, wait, stop.

40:53.985 --> 40:54.818
Wait, wait, wait, stop, stop.

40:54.820 --> 40:56.720
- What are you doing?

40:56.721 --> 40:58.621
- You were gonna call the police, weren't you?
- No I wasn't, give me my phone back.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.090
- I'm sorry, I'm not gonna let that happen.
- Albert, give me my phone.

41:01.092 --> 41:03.226
- Listen, listen, listen, just get back, listen to me.
- Albert, you need to let him go.

41:03.228 --> 41:04.828
- I'm not gonna let him go.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.429
If you want, I can't let you leave
okay, you know too much.

41:06.431 --> 41:07.997
- Take a deep breath.
Just take a deep breath.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.132
- I'm breathing.
- Calm down.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.033
- I'm breathing.
- It's okay, that's it.

41:10.035 --> 41:12.436
- Get down on the floor.

41:12.437 --> 41:14.838
Put your hands behind your back, okay?
- Oh what's he gonna do, squeeze you to death?

41:14.840 --> 41:15.672
- I swear to God!

41:15.674 --> 41:16.840
Ah, I'm a crazy person.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.208
You deal with crazy
people, right?

41:19.444 --> 41:20.977
- Deep breath, deep
breath, calm down!

41:20.979 --> 41:22.479
Calm down!

41:22.480 --> 41:23.980
- Come down, put your hands,
put your hands behind your back now!

41:23.982 --> 41:24.914
- Albert, please, okay.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.115
- I'm gonna count to three.

41:26.117 --> 41:27.851
- This is just a
fantasy, all right?

41:27.853 --> 41:29.285
None of this is real!
- Get down!

41:29.287 --> 41:31.421
One!

41:31.422 --> 41:33.556
Okay, put your hands behind your back.
- Albert, please, please.

41:33.558 --> 41:34.891
Just think about
your daughter, okay?

41:34.893 --> 41:36.226
- That's exactly what I'm doing.

41:36.228 --> 41:37.694
- Think
about everything

41:37.696 --> 41:39.295
we've been accomplishing,
don't throw this away!

41:39.297 --> 41:40.430
- I am thinking!

41:40.432 --> 41:42.432
Please, Albert please.

41:44.870 --> 41:45.869
- Okay.

41:45.871 --> 41:46.703
- Albert.

41:46.705 --> 41:48.371
- Here we go.

41:48.372 --> 41:50.038
- Albert, you've been isolated in
this place for far too long, okay?

41:50.041 --> 41:52.108
Your mind is playing
tricks on you.

41:52.110 --> 41:55.111
You have to just
remember who you are.

41:55.113 --> 41:56.646
Don't lose sight of reality!

41:57.649 --> 41:59.716
Albert please.
- I'm so sorry.

41:59.718 --> 42:01.818
- No, please come back Albert.

42:01.820 --> 42:04.153
Stop this!

42:11.930 --> 42:13.363
- I need to know
where the book is.

42:13.365 --> 42:14.364
Did it burn up?

42:14.366 --> 42:15.899
- Albert, listen to me.

42:15.901 --> 42:17.433
Listen to me.

42:17.435 --> 42:18.668
- The book, where's
the book, please?

42:18.670 --> 42:21.638
- I don't know, I left
it on a book somewhere.

42:21.640 --> 42:23.806
Albert, none of this is real.

42:23.808 --> 42:25.875
You're hurting people, Albert.

42:25.877 --> 42:27.644
Don't lose sight of what
we've accomplished so far!

42:27.646 --> 42:30.113
- Shh, you have to tell me where the book is!
- Albert!

42:30.115 --> 42:31.047
- Liv, Liv!

42:31.049 --> 42:32.649
Liv, please, we're back here!

42:32.651 --> 42:34.117
Liv, please help me!

42:34.119 --> 42:38.454
Help me, get me out
of here, please!

42:38.456 --> 42:39.722
- Albert?

42:39.724 --> 42:43.092
- Hey, sweety, what are
you doing here so soon?

42:43.094 --> 42:44.694
It's good to see you again.

42:44.696 --> 42:47.297
- My god, what happened to you?
You look like shit.

42:48.233 --> 42:49.599
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

42:49.601 --> 42:50.867
I ran into a wall.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.103
I was in a rush and the
wall wasn't, and bam.

42:54.105 --> 42:55.104
But I'm okay.

42:55.106 --> 42:57.574
Nothing some iodine can't fix.

42:57.576 --> 42:59.042
- Where's Dr. Tanner?

42:59.044 --> 43:00.176
- Who?

43:00.178 --> 43:00.977
- Dr. Tanner.

43:00.979 --> 43:02.011
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.446
He was here yesterday

43:03.448 --> 43:05.181
but he had to go.

43:05.183 --> 43:06.382
He hasn't been here since.

43:06.384 --> 43:07.884
He had some appointment,
something going on.

43:07.886 --> 43:10.653
- Well it looks like
his car outside.

43:10.655 --> 43:15.558
- Uh, well we get a lot of
hikers that leave it here.

43:16.695 --> 43:17.660
They probably should
be charged parking,

43:17.662 --> 43:18.928
I'll make a fortune.

43:19.764 --> 43:20.763
Who you calling?

43:20.765 --> 43:22.732
- I'm calling Dr. Tanner.

43:29.374 --> 43:31.007
- I have to go pee.

43:39.784 --> 43:42.185
- Hey, Dr. Tanner, it's Liv.

43:43.355 --> 43:46.122
I'm at the bookstore. I don't know
if you forgot or what happened there

43:46.124 --> 43:49.092
but I guess I'll
call you later, bye.

43:49.094 --> 43:50.693
- See?

43:50.695 --> 43:53.062
He's probably busy psychologicizing
some nutjob, you know.

43:53.064 --> 43:55.298
A ring like that
could set him off.

43:57.802 --> 43:59.102
But he's not here.

43:59.103 --> 44:00.403
So we'll be wasting time
waiting for him here.

44:00.405 --> 44:01.938
- It's weird though
'cause that looks exactly

44:01.940 --> 44:03.506
like his car outside.

44:03.508 --> 44:05.575
- Well you know.

44:05.576 --> 44:07.643
- I don't know why he would tell me
he's gonna be here and not be here.

44:07.646 --> 44:10.813
That's really unlike him.

44:13.118 --> 44:15.084
- You know, I gotta go tinkle.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.619
Just, can you give me a second,

44:16.621 --> 44:17.720
I'll be right back.

44:17.722 --> 44:20.189
Just hang on to that thought.

44:22.494 --> 44:24.560
- Liv, Liv, please
help me, I'm back here!

44:24.562 --> 44:25.561
No, no, no!

44:27.999 --> 44:29.432
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

44:29.434 --> 44:30.733
No!

44:30.735 --> 44:32.201
Liv, help me, I'm back here!

44:32.203 --> 44:33.269
Help me!

44:33.271 --> 44:35.238
No, no, Albert, no, no!

44:39.244 --> 44:40.043
No, Albert, please.

44:40.045 --> 44:41.411
- Nine o'clock, okay?

44:41.413 --> 44:42.545
Shh, shh.

44:42.547 --> 44:47.350
- Albert.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.352
I want the cops, now!

44:49.354 --> 44:50.253
No!

44:51.356 --> 44:52.722
- Albert!

44:52.724 --> 44:54.223
What the hell are you doing?

44:54.225 --> 44:55.324
- I can explain.

44:55.326 --> 44:58.294
It's not what it looks like.

44:58.296 --> 45:00.329
He's trying to rob me.

45:00.331 --> 45:01.898
I was lying about the
wall thing and the face.

45:01.900 --> 45:04.867
He came here and so he robbed me
and, would you stop?

45:05.804 --> 45:07.504
- I am so sorry.

45:07.505 --> 45:09.205
- What are you doing, are you crazy?
- Get out of here!

45:09.207 --> 45:10.039
- He can hurt you.

45:10.041 --> 45:10.973
- He's tied up.

45:10.975 --> 45:12.175
- Listen, he's insane, okay?

45:12.177 --> 45:14.377
He plays with your mind,
that's what he does.

45:14.379 --> 45:15.311
And he hurt me really bad,

45:15.313 --> 45:17.313
I don't want him to hurt you.

45:17.314 --> 45:19.314
- Would you please let me go, he's gone crazy!
- You have to believe me.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.584
- He thinks I'm some
sort of character of a book.

45:21.586 --> 45:22.485
- Albert!
- He's lying.

45:22.487 --> 45:23.319
Trust me, he's lying.

45:23.321 --> 45:24.153
- Where's Dr. Tanner?

45:24.155 --> 45:25.905
- He's not here.

45:25.906 --> 45:27.656
- Yes he's got him tied up in the back too.
- That's what he does.

45:27.659 --> 45:29.959
He's lying. He's playing with your
mind, that's what he does.

45:29.961 --> 45:31.394
No, listen, do you wanna die?

45:31.396 --> 45:33.429
Do you wanna get killed?
'Cause that's what he'll do, truly.

45:33.431 --> 45:35.965
- Give me one moment. I'll be right back
to untie you. Just give me a second.

45:35.967 --> 45:36.666
- Livvie, please!

45:37.869 --> 45:39.352
Livvie.

45:39.353 --> 45:40.836
- Oh my gosh.
Dr. Tanner, are you all right?

45:40.839 --> 45:41.704
- No, no, no, no.

45:41.706 --> 45:42.939
- Albert, get off me!

45:42.941 --> 45:44.474
- Let me explain
what's happening.

45:44.476 --> 45:45.775
Please, don't fight me.

45:45.777 --> 45:46.943
Listen, listen, listen.

45:46.945 --> 45:48.544
I didn't wanna tie him up

45:48.546 --> 45:49.479
but I had no other choice,

45:49.481 --> 45:50.413
he was gonna call the police.

45:50.415 --> 45:52.448
- Albert, this has gone too far.

45:52.450 --> 45:54.450
You're not well, you
can't tie people up.

45:54.452 --> 45:55.284
- Livvie.

45:55.286 --> 45:56.119
Livvie, stop, please.

45:56.121 --> 45:57.019
I don't wanna do this.

45:57.021 --> 45:58.020
Stop.

45:58.022 --> 45:59.856
He was gonna let Sherwood go.

45:59.858 --> 46:00.990
Do you know what that means?

46:00.992 --> 46:03.543
- Enough, Albert!

46:03.544 --> 46:06.095
- Listen, I just wanna keep Sherwood here
until it's safe. That's it, two days tops.

46:06.097 --> 46:07.730
Okay?

46:07.732 --> 46:09.432
- This is
all in your head.

46:09.434 --> 46:10.399
None of this is real!

46:10.401 --> 46:11.934
- No, listen.

46:11.936 --> 46:13.503
You have to believe
me right now, okay?

46:13.505 --> 46:15.872
Do you realize what will
happen if Sherwood's let go?

46:15.874 --> 46:17.640
We're dead, all
of us, we're dead.

46:17.642 --> 46:20.977
- It's all in your head, dammit!
- You have to believe me.

46:20.979 --> 46:23.613
- Albert, let me go.

46:24.949 --> 46:27.049
I don't wanna hurt you
but if I have to, I will.

46:29.454 --> 46:30.987
Albert.

46:30.989 --> 46:32.421
It's your life.

46:33.525 --> 46:36.659
If you wanna go to
prison, be my guest!

46:36.661 --> 46:38.194
You're already in one anyway.

46:39.531 --> 46:41.397
I should have never promised mom

46:41.399 --> 46:43.633
that I would take care of you.

46:49.808 --> 46:51.808
- Listen, listen to me.

46:53.444 --> 46:55.311
I didn't mean to
hurt either of you.

46:56.981 --> 46:58.014
Honestly, I didn't.

47:00.118 --> 47:04.387
- I will never understand
why mom loved you.

47:07.325 --> 47:08.224
I'm sorry.

47:11.095 --> 47:11.994
- Argh!

47:13.531 --> 47:14.764
- Dr. Tanner, I'm so sorry.

47:14.766 --> 47:17.266
I had no idea how
far gone he was.

47:21.172 --> 47:22.171
- Livvie, don't go.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.206
Livvie, please!

47:23.208 --> 47:24.407
He'll kill you!

47:24.409 --> 47:25.975
Livvie, come back!

47:27.812 --> 47:28.978
- Let me out!

47:30.114 --> 47:32.481
- Oh my gosh, I am so
sorry about all this.

47:32.483 --> 47:33.883
I have no clue what's
gotten into him.

47:33.885 --> 47:35.885
- He's gone crazy!

47:37.055 --> 47:38.888
- I'll make it right
though, I promise.

47:38.890 --> 47:41.123
I don't know how but I will.

47:41.125 --> 47:42.692
- Just get me out of here.

47:48.233 --> 47:50.032
- Dr. Tanner, can
you finish this up?

47:50.034 --> 47:51.334
I gotta go check on Albert.

47:51.336 --> 47:53.536
Yeah, go ahead, go.

47:53.538 --> 47:54.604
- Thank you.

47:55.773 --> 47:57.173
- You're gonna be
all right, sir.

48:06.918 --> 48:08.317
- Oh my god Livvie.

48:08.319 --> 48:09.151
Livvie, are you okay?

48:09.153 --> 48:10.319
- Yeah, I'm fine.

48:10.321 --> 48:11.888
Oh my gosh.

48:11.890 --> 48:13.356
- Where's Sherwood?

48:13.358 --> 48:15.391
- I'm sorry, I had no choice.

48:15.393 --> 48:16.459
- Neither do I.

48:16.461 --> 48:17.994
- Oh my god.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.095
Albert?

48:19.097 --> 48:20.229
Albert!

48:20.231 --> 48:21.197
Let me out!

48:22.800 --> 48:24.267
Albert?

48:24.269 --> 48:25.268
Albert?

48:25.270 --> 48:26.702
Let me out!

48:26.704 --> 48:27.603
Shit.

48:31.009 --> 48:31.974
- You're safe now.

48:35.580 --> 48:36.612
- Where's the book?

48:37.548 --> 48:39.181
- What book?

48:39.183 --> 48:40.683
- Atomic Chess.

48:42.287 --> 48:45.154
- Are you
talking about that book

48:45.156 --> 48:47.556
that's supposed to help
you destroy the world?

48:47.558 --> 48:49.292
- Yes.

48:50.395 --> 48:51.727
Where is it?

48:51.729 --> 48:54.096
- Look, I don't know
where the book is, okay?

48:55.099 --> 48:56.365
I really don't, okay?

48:56.367 --> 48:57.967
I can't even think
clearly right now.

49:03.374 --> 49:05.041
But I set you free.

49:07.245 --> 49:09.979
- And for that Doc, I thank you.

49:14.152 --> 49:15.051
- Oh dear.

49:24.329 --> 49:25.261
- Come on.

49:25.263 --> 49:26.162
Come on!

49:39.143 --> 49:41.177
- Dr. Tanner, Dr. Tanner.

49:41.179 --> 49:42.611
What happened to you?

49:42.613 --> 49:43.679
Where's Sherwood?

49:46.017 --> 49:47.383
- You were right.

49:48.987 --> 49:50.386
- Oh my god.

49:50.388 --> 49:51.354
Dr. Tanner.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.022
Dr. Tanner!

49:53.024 --> 49:53.923
- Albert!

49:55.660 --> 49:57.626
- He's dead, he's dead.

49:58.763 --> 50:00.129
- What?

50:00.131 --> 50:00.997
Dr. Tanner?

50:02.467 --> 50:05.034
Dr. Tanner, can you hear me?

50:05.036 --> 50:06.402
- Oh my god, oh
my god, oh my god.

50:06.404 --> 50:08.270
Oh my god, oh my god.

50:08.272 --> 50:09.638
Oh my god, he's dead.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.539
He's dead.

50:11.542 --> 50:12.875
- You killed him.

50:12.877 --> 50:13.776
- What?

50:13.778 --> 50:15.511
No, it was Sherwood!

50:18.816 --> 50:20.216
No, no, no, I can't
let you do that.

50:23.388 --> 50:25.554
What the hell are
you doing with a gun?

50:25.556 --> 50:26.989
Do you realize how
dangerous those things are?

50:26.991 --> 50:27.923
- You just killed someone!

50:27.925 --> 50:29.291
- Livvie, I couldn't hurt a fly,

50:29.293 --> 50:30.126
let alone a human being.

50:30.128 --> 50:31.627
You have to believe me.

50:31.629 --> 50:33.863
- I have no idea of
what you're capable of.

50:33.865 --> 50:36.632
- Livvie, please please
listen to me, okay?

50:36.634 --> 50:37.533
I have to find that book.

50:37.535 --> 50:39.101
I have to protect you.

50:39.103 --> 50:39.935
I have no other choice.

50:39.937 --> 50:42.254
- Stop it, Albert.

50:42.255 --> 50:44.572
- That's all I wanna do, I just wanna
protect you, okay? You have to believe me.

50:45.510 --> 50:46.475
We have to find that book.

50:46.477 --> 50:48.444
That's the only solution, okay?

50:48.446 --> 50:49.845
I'm gonna find the book.

50:49.847 --> 50:52.148
If you wanna shoot me, go ahead.

50:52.150 --> 50:53.916
- Surprise!

50:55.720 --> 50:57.353
- What are you doing?!

50:57.355 --> 50:59.655
- Get over here!

51:00.425 --> 51:02.224
- Let her go!

51:04.095 --> 51:05.227
Stop, enough!

51:06.030 --> 51:07.263
- The book!

51:07.265 --> 51:08.230
- I don't
have your book.

51:09.167 --> 51:10.166
- Albert.

51:10.168 --> 51:11.667
- Here, here, here's your book.

51:11.669 --> 51:12.501
- The book!

51:21.546 --> 51:23.112
You're gonna regret
that, Albert.

51:54.545 --> 51:57.079
I can hear you
breathing, Albert.

51:57.081 --> 51:59.748
I must say I'm a little
salty about the pepper spray.

52:01.586 --> 52:04.453
You're not trying
to leave, are you?

52:13.331 --> 52:15.965
Albert, stop hiding.

52:15.967 --> 52:17.833
You can't run from the pain.

52:17.835 --> 52:20.569
You try to escape
life through stories.

52:21.672 --> 52:25.274
Sci-fi, thriller,
adventure, romance!

52:34.018 --> 52:36.252
And fantasy!

52:36.254 --> 52:39.955
Look at me, Albert,
I'm real!

52:42.460 --> 52:47.096
I'm coming for you,
Albert!

52:53.671 --> 52:54.937
- Ow, ow, ow, oh my god.

52:54.939 --> 52:56.172
- It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

52:56.174 --> 52:58.207
Shh, put this over here.

53:00.745 --> 53:02.178
I'm so sorry.

53:02.180 --> 53:04.613
- Dad, stop worrying
about me for two seconds.

53:05.716 --> 53:07.750
- You're not afraid
of anything, are you?

53:07.752 --> 53:09.585
You know when you
were a baby girl,

53:11.389 --> 53:13.822
you used to drive
me insane, you know.

53:13.824 --> 53:15.891
You'd find the
boundaries and now you're

53:17.195 --> 53:19.962
riding motorcycles
and carrying guns

53:19.964 --> 53:21.230
and wearing a nose ring.

53:22.433 --> 53:24.066
- Dad.

53:24.068 --> 53:25.134
I get scared too.

53:26.504 --> 53:29.438
But I decided a long time ago

53:29.440 --> 53:32.241
that I wasn't gonna let fear
stop me from doing anything.

53:34.645 --> 53:36.612
I didn't want it
to get in the way.

53:36.614 --> 53:38.247
I didn't want to end up like...

53:41.385 --> 53:42.284
- Like me.

53:45.022 --> 53:48.390
- But you know, it was
those adventure books

53:48.392 --> 53:50.960
that we'd read together
when I was a kid

53:50.962 --> 53:54.430
that taught me that
being strong is brave

53:55.366 --> 53:56.632
and being brave is okay.

54:00.404 --> 54:03.105
- You know I wanted
to be like Hemingway

54:03.107 --> 54:04.707
and write the most
amazing stories

54:04.709 --> 54:07.276
and live a life far more
adventurous and all that.

54:09.714 --> 54:11.280
Ever since Petie died, I just,

54:12.516 --> 54:13.816
I couldn't write anymore.

54:15.319 --> 54:16.218
- Who's Petie?

54:17.788 --> 54:18.687
- He was my...

54:26.163 --> 54:27.463
He was my brother.

54:27.465 --> 54:29.732
I told you I hadn't
finished writing it yet.

54:31.369 --> 54:33.035
- Al.

54:33.037 --> 54:33.936
Al.

54:33.938 --> 54:35.004
- Pete, I can't take this.

54:35.006 --> 54:36.639
It's your magic orb.

54:36.641 --> 54:37.539
- Al, Al.

54:40.278 --> 54:41.877
Awwwh.

54:41.879 --> 54:44.647
- Oh, you think it'll help
me finish writing my story.

54:44.649 --> 54:46.181
- Al!

54:46.183 --> 54:47.750
Al, Al, Al.

54:47.752 --> 54:48.984
- All right, tell you what.

54:48.986 --> 54:50.919
I'll finish writing
it tomorrow, okay?

54:52.056 --> 54:54.590
But for now you can play
with my slingshot, deal?

55:12.176 --> 55:13.342
- Al!

55:18.516 --> 55:19.649
Al!

55:19.650 --> 55:20.783
- Petie, I told you
that I'm playing.

55:20.785 --> 55:22.051
Go play somewhere else.

55:22.053 --> 55:23.218
- Al!

55:23.220 --> 55:24.053
Al.

55:24.055 --> 55:26.722
- Petie, stop!

55:26.724 --> 55:28.190
Don't move.

55:28.192 --> 55:29.091
- Al.

55:30.695 --> 55:31.794
- I got you.

55:31.796 --> 55:33.896
Now slowly turn around.

55:33.898 --> 55:34.930
- Al?

55:34.932 --> 55:35.931
- That's it.

55:35.933 --> 55:36.932
You got it.

55:36.934 --> 55:37.766
- Al, Al!

55:37.768 --> 55:38.767
No, no, no.

55:38.769 --> 55:39.902
- I got you!

55:39.904 --> 55:42.204
- Al?
- I'm not gonna let you fall.

55:43.607 --> 55:45.274
Hold on, I see a rope.

55:45.276 --> 55:47.509
- Al, Al?

55:47.511 --> 55:48.410
- Petie?

55:49.347 --> 55:50.879
Petie!

55:50.881 --> 55:51.780
No, Petie!

55:52.783 --> 55:53.682
No, Petie!

55:55.720 --> 55:57.519
- My parents gave
him this ball to,

55:58.589 --> 56:00.255
to help him deal
with his disability

56:00.257 --> 56:01.490
and give him confidence.

56:03.828 --> 56:07.196
He'd be alive today if I
just finished the damn story.

56:07.198 --> 56:08.331
You know?

56:08.332 --> 56:09.465
And now it's come
back to haunt me.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.332
Maybe this is punishment.

56:10.334 --> 56:11.734
- No, dad.

56:11.736 --> 56:12.868
Don't blame yourself.

56:14.505 --> 56:15.404
It's not true.

56:17.308 --> 56:21.343
- You know when you were born,
my desire to write came back.

56:21.345 --> 56:23.946
And I wrote story after
story after story.

56:26.484 --> 56:29.385
I was just never able to come
up with an ending, you know?

56:32.456 --> 56:33.355
- Dad.

56:35.226 --> 56:38.327
This is one story that you
have to find a way to end.

56:43.534 --> 56:45.934
- I'm gonna find that
book and destroy it.

56:45.936 --> 56:47.669
- Here, you might need this.

56:50.508 --> 56:51.640
- What, you smoke now too?

56:51.642 --> 56:53.375
- Dad, go.

56:53.377 --> 56:54.276
- Right.

57:08.659 --> 57:10.659
Hang in there, buddy, okay?

57:10.661 --> 57:12.728
I'm coming back for you.

57:32.483 --> 57:33.382
- Albert.

57:40.691 --> 57:41.590
Albert!

57:52.670 --> 57:54.770
I know you're right here.

58:05.282 --> 58:06.515
There you are.

58:12.890 --> 58:14.790
So you're the culprit.

58:55.533 --> 58:58.534
- You know when you were
born my desire to write came back.

58:59.904 --> 59:03.405
And I wrote story after
story after story.

59:55.793 --> 59:56.625
Livvie!

59:56.627 --> 59:58.026
- Dad?

59:58.028 --> 01:00:00.128
Dad, no, he wants you to come.
- Please, don't, don't hurt her.

01:00:00.130 --> 01:00:01.530
Please, come here.

01:00:01.532 --> 01:00:03.031
It's just between
you and me, okay?

01:00:03.033 --> 01:00:04.132
She has nothing to do with this.

01:00:04.134 --> 01:00:05.033
- Hand it over.

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:07.636
- Dad, what are you doing?

01:00:09.740 --> 01:00:11.139
You didn't destroy it!

01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.642
- Great story.

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:14.876
- No, no, no, stop.

01:00:14.878 --> 01:00:17.212
Stop!
- Maybe we should see if Liv bleeds first of all.

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:19.314
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

01:00:19.316 --> 01:00:20.482
Stop.

01:00:20.484 --> 01:00:22.050
Okay, take the
book, take the book.

01:00:22.052 --> 01:00:23.118
Take your damn book.

01:00:26.657 --> 01:00:27.923
You know what?

01:00:27.925 --> 01:00:29.791
It's about time, this
story ends right here!

01:00:33.864 --> 01:00:35.497
- What are you doing?

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:37.065
- Huh, how's that?

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:38.066
How's that, huh?

01:00:38.068 --> 01:00:38.900
How's that feel?

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:39.768
- Albert, stop.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:43.905
I don't wanna have to climb
back up after I'm done.

01:00:43.907 --> 01:00:44.940
What are you doing?

01:00:44.942 --> 01:00:46.708
Seriously, what are you doing?

01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.210
You really think just
like tearing the paper

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:50.679
is gonna destroy me?

01:00:50.681 --> 01:00:51.913
Wow.

01:00:51.915 --> 01:00:53.682
I mean I knew you were
dumb, Albert, but.

01:00:55.219 --> 01:00:57.252
Wow, I don't even have words.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:00:59.521
Look at this.

01:01:01.058 --> 01:01:03.058
Oh, oh, oh, my knee.

01:01:03.060 --> 01:01:05.093
Ow, ooh eh, no.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:06.862
No, that's not
gonna work for you.

01:01:06.864 --> 01:01:08.430
I always thought you
were a little bit smarter

01:01:08.432 --> 01:01:09.965
but I guess I was wrong, huh.

01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:17.806
Where is it?

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:21.510
- Because contained
within the pages of that book

01:01:21.512 --> 01:01:23.245
is all he needed to
destroy the world.

01:01:23.247 --> 01:01:26.081
Because contained within
the pages of that book

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:27.616
was all he needed to
destroy the world.

01:01:31.488 --> 01:01:32.888
- What are
you looking at, Albert?

01:01:32.890 --> 01:01:34.856
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Huh, maybe this?

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.858
- Some things.

01:01:40.164 --> 01:01:41.430
- Oh man.

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:43.999
I guess the rabbit beat
the tortoise, didn't it?

01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:45.367
Now I've got the chip.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:48.970
My phone.

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:50.205
- It's the phone.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:53.842
That's what he needs
to detonate the weapon.

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:56.645
- The phone, that's what he
needs to detonate the weapon.

01:01:56.647 --> 01:01:59.047
It's all coming full
circle now, isn't it?

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:00.148
Ring a bell?

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:01.683
Global impact?

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.419
Yeah, get it?

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:05.554
Albert, you still--

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:07.723
You stupid little huss!

01:02:07.725 --> 01:02:09.291
- Oh my god,

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:10.292
- Stop!

01:02:10.294 --> 01:02:11.893
Look, stop.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:14.563
Stop, stop, look,
look, see that?

01:02:14.565 --> 01:02:15.630
See that, you see that?

01:02:15.632 --> 01:02:16.798
Listen, listen.

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:19.568
- Ah, stop, stop!

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:21.303
Albert, stop.

01:02:21.305 --> 01:02:23.105
You stop.

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:24.906
- I'm not gonna give this to you
because if I give it, we're all dead.

01:02:24.908 --> 01:02:26.575
- I'll kill her and I'm
not afraid of doing it.

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:28.043
- That was, as long
as it's functioning,

01:02:28.045 --> 01:02:29.511
you can carry out your plan.

01:02:37.154 --> 01:02:39.121
I can prove it.

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:41.156
I can prove that you're
the character in my story.

01:02:42.893 --> 01:02:45.794
I can prove it's you. It's just down
the street, it's not too far from here.

01:02:45.796 --> 01:02:46.928
- Outside?
- Yeah.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:48.897
Don't move any closer,
I swear to god, okay?

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:52.234
Let's just head on
down there, you first.

01:02:52.236 --> 01:02:55.771
Don't, I'll crack it
in two, I swear to God.

01:02:55.773 --> 01:02:57.672
Okay, just make
your way over there.

01:02:57.674 --> 01:02:59.741
Stop, no stop!

01:02:59.743 --> 01:03:01.009
She has nothing to do with this!

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:03.178
- No, she has everything
to do with this, Albert.

01:03:03.180 --> 01:03:04.646
She's my insurance.

01:03:04.648 --> 01:03:08.183
You break my phone, I
break your daughter.

01:03:08.185 --> 01:03:09.117
Go ahead.

01:03:09.119 --> 01:03:10.352
- Right behind you, okay?

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:12.053
- Yeah, so was that.

01:03:12.055 --> 01:03:13.388
So is the door.

01:03:23.333 --> 01:03:27.002
- Dad, come
on, you can do it.

01:03:27.004 --> 01:03:29.004
- Just go straight
down that way.

01:03:29.006 --> 01:03:30.806
I'm right behind you.

01:03:35.245 --> 01:03:37.078
- Come on, dad.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.149
- I'm coming.

01:03:51.495 --> 01:03:52.627
Okay do this.

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:54.796
We can do this.

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:25.093
- What the hell is going on?

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:27.095
Why is Goliath still
up and running?

01:04:27.097 --> 01:04:28.630
- Sorry General, seems
like we're having

01:04:28.632 --> 01:04:30.398
some complications here.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400
- That's pretty obvious.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:33.802
- We have a bit of a problem.

01:04:33.804 --> 01:04:35.637
Dr. Lin died of a heart attack.

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.072
- Yes, I'm aware of that.

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:41.142
But why is this monstrosity
of a weapon still on?

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:42.644
- It has to be
powered down slowly

01:04:42.646 --> 01:04:45.313
and in the proper sequence
or it'll self-detonate.

01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:47.382
- Lovely.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:51.152
And how long is that gonna take?

01:04:51.154 --> 01:04:52.954
- Sherwood and Dr.
Lin were the only ones

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:54.522
who knew how to.

01:04:54.524 --> 01:04:55.957
And we can't get
a hold of Sherwood

01:04:55.959 --> 01:04:58.493
but I have his notes and I'll
have it figured out soon.

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:00.095
- Just get it done, Doctor.

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:03.231
And try not to blow us
all to kingdom come.

01:05:06.069 --> 01:05:08.236
- It's straight ahead,
through that gate.

01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:19.881
It's okay sweetie, it's okay.

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:23.051
Be careful.

01:05:28.992 --> 01:05:30.926
What I wanna show
you is inside here.

01:05:35.666 --> 01:05:37.182
Straight ahead.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:38.699
- Us first, huh?
- I'm right behind you.

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:39.567
Easy!

01:05:39.569 --> 01:05:40.402
Easy.

01:05:43.307 --> 01:05:44.406
Right behind you.

01:05:44.408 --> 01:05:45.307
Straight ahead.

01:05:47.878 --> 01:05:49.144
- Just remember, Albert.

01:05:50.514 --> 01:05:52.647
If this is a trick, I will
kill little Livvie here.

01:05:52.649 --> 01:05:53.949
- It's not.

01:05:53.951 --> 01:05:55.050
It's just straight ahead.

01:05:55.052 --> 01:05:56.451
Easy, easy!

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.652
Straight ahead.

01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:59.254
It's right behind
the other side there.

01:06:08.365 --> 01:06:09.531
- Al?

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:12.534
Al!

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.447
- There, there, that's it.

01:06:26.283 --> 01:06:28.416
It's that box over there

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:29.784
on the other side of this.

01:06:31.421 --> 01:06:32.654
No, no, what are you doing?

01:06:32.656 --> 01:06:34.889
- This is just leverage,
remember, Albert?

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:36.324
Just remember, if
that phone goes down,

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:38.026
little Livvie goes
down after it.

01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:40.495
- Easy.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.907
It's that box right over there.

01:06:52.909 --> 01:06:54.142
The box right over there.

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:56.077
I got it there.

01:06:56.079 --> 01:06:57.379
Just dust off the top

01:06:58.482 --> 01:07:00.615
and you'll see what
I'm talking about.

01:07:32.516 --> 01:07:33.815
You see, Sherwood?

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:37.318
That's what inspired
me to create you.

01:07:37.320 --> 01:07:39.254
- This is a, it's
just a coincidence.

01:07:40.490 --> 01:07:41.322
Nobody created me.

01:07:41.324 --> 01:07:42.690
You didn't create me.

01:07:44.428 --> 01:07:46.494
You didn't create me,
nobody created me.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.534
- What are you doing,
it's dangerous.

01:07:52.536 --> 01:07:53.435
- Yes.

01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:56.304
But now that you know the truth,

01:07:56.306 --> 01:07:57.806
you're free to do what you want.

01:07:57.808 --> 01:07:59.307
You can choose your own destiny.

01:07:59.309 --> 01:08:01.509
You don't have to
go through with it.

01:08:01.511 --> 01:08:02.610
You're a genius.

01:08:04.047 --> 01:08:06.915
You can find a cure for
cancer, for world hunger even.

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.583
- What, world peace?

01:08:08.585 --> 01:08:10.485
- Yes, world peace.

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:12.487
- And be just like you, Albert?

01:08:12.489 --> 01:08:13.822
Look at you.

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:15.857
You're afraid, you're
alone, you're scared,

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:17.425
you're tired, you're pathetic.

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:19.694
- Yeah, I know.

01:08:20.796 --> 01:08:22.029
I wasted my life.

01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:25.233
But you know what, it's
not too late for me.

01:08:26.169 --> 01:08:27.702
And it's not too late for you.

01:08:29.973 --> 01:08:31.139
You're in control now.

01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:34.908
You could choose
your own destiny,

01:08:34.911 --> 01:08:35.844
your own path.

01:08:39.716 --> 01:08:40.615
- You're right.

01:08:50.292 --> 01:08:51.526
Remember that?

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:56.096
It contained a microchip

01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.533
to turn my phone
into a detonator

01:08:58.535 --> 01:09:00.201
for a weapon I built.

01:09:11.413 --> 01:09:12.814
- Oh, thank god.

01:09:12.816 --> 01:09:14.616
Thank you, thank you.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:17.352
Oh god.

01:09:18.388 --> 01:09:19.287
Thank god.

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:24.792
You okay?

01:09:25.629 --> 01:09:26.594
Okay, okay.

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:28.229
- Be careful.

01:09:28.231 --> 01:09:29.731
Take it slow.

01:09:29.733 --> 01:09:32.033
Now come over here.

01:09:32.035 --> 01:09:33.301
- How's your leg?

01:09:33.303 --> 01:09:34.135
- It hurts.

01:09:35.138 --> 01:09:36.437
- I'm so sorry.

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:39.174
I'll get you out of here, okay?

01:09:52.122 --> 01:09:53.520
- No, no, no!

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:54.422
- What the hell's happening?

01:09:54.424 --> 01:09:56.424
- I don't understand.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:58.493
It appears somebody's
established an external link.

01:09:58.495 --> 01:09:59.861
- What the hell does that mean?

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:01.429
- Somebody is getting ready
to detonate it remotely.

01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:03.565
- Who, shut it down, now!

01:10:04.501 --> 01:10:05.400
- I can't.

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:13.308
- On your face, it's off.

01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:15.310
- I know.

01:10:15.312 --> 01:10:17.312
- Dad, he's got the phone.

01:10:18.348 --> 01:10:19.914
- Wait, what are you doing?

01:10:21.017 --> 01:10:22.016
- Uh uh.

01:10:22.018 --> 01:10:23.585
I said contained, Albert.

01:10:23.587 --> 01:10:26.421
That's past tense, you
should have caught that.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:28.640
- But you're free now.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:30.858
You can do whatever you want with your life.
- I know, and I am.

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:41.135
Look at this world, Albert.

01:10:42.239 --> 01:10:46.474
Rape, molestation, war, abuse.

01:10:46.476 --> 01:10:47.475
People just numbing their pain

01:10:47.477 --> 01:10:49.110
through sex, drugs, and alcohol.

01:10:49.112 --> 01:10:51.980
Just so they can keep
on existing in misery.

01:10:51.982 --> 01:10:54.048
But for what reason?

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.916
I mean why?

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:57.552
- Hope.

01:10:59.556 --> 01:11:00.388
- Hope.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.559
Hope.

01:11:05.662 --> 01:11:07.562
It's the elusive
carrot on a stick.

01:11:08.898 --> 01:11:12.166
It's the dangling of a promise
of a better life someday.

01:11:14.804 --> 01:11:16.137
Someday never comes.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:23.711
Now this is, this is how the
story was supposed to end.

01:11:28.351 --> 01:11:30.118
Albert, you have changed.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.853
I'm so proud of you.

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:34.188
Unfortunately it's
too little, too late.

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:35.223
Goodbye, Albert.

01:11:44.801 --> 01:11:47.135
Albert!

01:11:47.137 --> 01:11:48.002
No!

01:12:04.688 --> 01:12:07.588
- Now that was a close call.

01:12:15.065 --> 01:12:16.597
- No, stop!

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:17.665
Don't hurt him!

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:21.836
Dad, no!

01:12:25.709 --> 01:12:27.375
Don't! fight!

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:29.010
Stop, please, stop!

01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:34.482
Hang on, dad!

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:44.892
- Livvie, hold on.

01:12:44.894 --> 01:12:45.793
- Okay.

01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:48.930
- Hold on!

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:52.567
- You're clinging by hope.

01:12:52.569 --> 01:12:54.435
I told you there
was no such thing.

01:13:13.189 --> 01:13:15.173
- Petie.

01:13:15.174 --> 01:13:17.158
Petie, I wish I
could. I wish I could.

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.627
No, I can't take this,
this is your magic orb.

01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:20.862
- Al, Al.

01:13:20.864 --> 01:13:22.063
Al!

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:23.598
- Oh, you think
it'll help me finish

01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:24.665
writing my story?

01:13:24.667 --> 01:13:25.566
- Al!

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:39.747
- It's time for your
story to end, Albert.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:42.283
One touch of a button
and it's the end.

01:13:43.286 --> 01:13:44.419
- Al.

01:13:45.422 --> 01:13:47.321
Awwwl. Ahhhh.

01:13:47.323 --> 01:13:48.523
- Petie?

01:13:48.525 --> 01:13:50.258
- Arrrrh!

01:13:53.696 --> 01:13:54.595
Al!

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.999
Please stay right there.

01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.036
- What the hell?

01:14:03.039 --> 01:14:04.505
- Al?

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:05.406
Al.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:07.341
Al!

01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:23.891
- Albert!

01:14:40.443 --> 01:14:42.977
- Dad, dad, it's
still counting down!

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.906
- We did it, Petie.

01:15:11.908 --> 01:15:12.807
We did it.

01:15:14.410 --> 01:15:15.576
Are you okay, Livvie?

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:17.445
- Yeah I'm fine,
just please hurry up.

01:15:17.447 --> 01:15:18.346
- Okay.
- Please.

01:15:18.348 --> 01:15:20.448
- Okay, I'm coming.

01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:21.749
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:15:28.291 --> 01:15:29.590
You ready Livvie?

01:15:29.592 --> 01:15:31.225
- Yeah, hold on, let me
finish this paragraph.

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.793
- There's no time for reading.

01:15:34.531 --> 01:15:36.497
- There's always
time for a good book.

01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:52.813
- All righty.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:53.814
- All right.
- Ready?

01:15:53.816 --> 01:15:55.082
- Mhmm, let's go.

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:27.114
â™ª I can't fly but I â™ª

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:32.019
â™ª I keep finding myself
soaring high above this â™ª

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:34.288
â™ª I have nothing left â™ª

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.824
â™ª But I keep on pouring out â™ª

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:39.594
â™ª Like I am endless â™ª

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.796
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:16:41.798 --> 01:16:43.464
â™ª Ow â™ª

01:16:43.466 --> 01:16:46.667
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:49.470
â™ª I don't run too fast â™ª

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:54.041
â™ª But I'm looking back at
miles and miles of past â™ª

01:16:54.043 --> 01:16:56.944
â™ª I can barely breathe â™ª

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.347
â™ª But I'm singing
out like this is â™ª

01:16:59.349 --> 01:17:01.515
â™ª Awesome to me â™ª

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:04.051
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:05.720
â™ª Whoah â™ª

01:17:05.722 --> 01:17:08.556
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:17:08.558 --> 01:17:12.460
â™ª Everybody there
see, another miracle â™ª

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:16.230
â™ª I can't believe I'm
living the impossible â™ª

01:17:16.232 --> 01:17:17.999
â™ª We are the sighted â™ª

01:17:18.001 --> 01:17:19.834
â™ª We are the wonder â™ª

01:17:19.836 --> 01:17:24.138
â™ª Another day of
living the impossible â™ª

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.073
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:27.575
â™ª Whoah â™ª

01:17:27.577 --> 01:17:30.845
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:33.681
â™ª I choose to be alive â™ª

01:17:33.683 --> 01:17:38.052
â™ª Especially because they
all say I should die â™ª

01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:41.122
â™ª I've wrestled death again â™ª

01:17:41.124 --> 01:17:43.524
â™ª I know more of his moves now â™ª

01:17:43.526 --> 01:17:45.826
â™ª And I won't give in â™ª

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.095
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:17:48.097 --> 01:17:49.797
â™ª Whoah â™ª

01:17:49.799 --> 01:17:52.967
â™ª Impossible â™ª

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:56.504
â™ª Everybody there
see, another miracle â™ª

01:17:56.506 --> 01:18:00.474
â™ª I can't believe I'm
living the impossible â™ª

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:02.243
â™ª We are decided â™ª

01:18:02.245 --> 01:18:04.145
â™ª We are the wonder â™ª

01:18:04.147 --> 01:18:07.815
â™ª Another day of
living the impossible â™ª

01:18:07.817 --> 01:18:11.218
â™ª Everyone in there
see, another miracle â™ª

01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:15.189
â™ª I can't believe I'm
living the impossible â™ª

01:18:15.191 --> 01:18:16.957
â™ª We are decided â™ª

01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:18.926
â™ª We are the wonder â™ª

01:18:18.928 --> 01:18:23.597
â™ª Another day of
living the impossible â™ª

01:18:30.306 --> 01:18:35.376
â™ª When I'm awake I wonder â™ª

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:38.245
â™ª If I'm gonna be all right â™ª

01:18:38.247 --> 01:18:40.948
â™ª But too much â™ª

01:19:46.349 --> 01:19:47.481
- Dr. Tanner?

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.416
Dr. Tanner, can you hear me?

01:19:49.418 --> 01:19:50.384
- Liv, I'm alive!

01:19:50.386 --> 01:19:51.252
Oh, okay.
- Holy shit!

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:57.992
- Ah, too much, I'm sorry.

01:19:57.994 --> 01:20:00.828
- I hate you!

01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:02.797
- Okay, to the top.

01:20:06.636 --> 01:20:08.769
- I came back, I'm alive!
