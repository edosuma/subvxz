40:17.850 --> 40:19.721
-OOH! WHAT HAPPENED?

40:19.852 --> 40:22.158
-OH, NOTHING.
JUST HAD A LITTLE RUN-IN
WITH A KNUCKLEHEAD.

40:24.813 --> 40:25.684
-IS THAT BETTER?

40:26.946 --> 40:28.034
-YEAH.

40:29.078 --> 40:31.124
-I TOLD YOU
I HAD THAT FANTASY ABOUT YOU.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.737
-UH, YEAH, I REMEMBER
YOU SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT.

40:36.825 --> 40:38.479
-WELL I THOUGHT IT WAS
ABOUT TIME I FULFILLED IT.

40:40.089 --> 40:42.657
-UH, SHOULD
WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE?

40:42.788 --> 40:44.137
-RIGHT HERE IS FINE.

40:54.190 --> 40:55.453
JUST LIKE I PICTURED IT.

40:59.805 --> 41:01.720
-UH, WAIT A MINUTE.

41:01.850 --> 41:04.026
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT ABOUT FULFILLING
YOUR FANTASY?

41:04.810 --> 41:05.854
-I JUST DID.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.466
-THAT WAS IT?
THAT WAS THE ENTIRE FANTASY?

41:09.162 --> 41:10.685
-I WAS ONLY NINE YEARS OLD.

41:11.904 --> 41:13.645
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

41:14.123 --> 41:17.475
-UH, WELL,
SOMETIMES WHEN PEOPLE GROW UP,
THEIR FANTASIES GROW WITH THEM.

41:19.128 --> 41:20.695
-YOU'RE SWEET.

41:20.826 --> 41:23.829
BUT I GOTTA CATCH A PLANE
TO AUSTRALIA. SORRY.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.180
DON'T FORGET
TO SAY HI TO JANICE.

41:28.050 --> 41:29.182
BYE, GARNER.

41:36.232 --> 41:37.320
-STRIKE OUT AGAIN?

41:37.973 --> 41:40.106
-EH, IT WOULDN'T HAVE
WORKED OUT ANYHOW.

41:40.236 --> 41:41.629
-WELL, I AGREE.

41:41.760 --> 41:44.806
ASIDE FROM LOOKS,
TALENT, INTELLIGENCE,

41:44.937 --> 41:47.069
SHE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE
THAT MUCH TO OFFER.

41:48.593 --> 41:50.812
-YOU REALLY KNOW
HOW TO PUT THINGS
IN PERSPECTIVE, DON'T YOU?

41:50.943 --> 41:52.074
-YEAH.

41:52.205 --> 41:53.511
IT'S WHY I GET THE BIG BUCKS.
