WEBVTT

00:02.620 --> 00:03.947
> Live television.

00:04.043 --> 00:05.142
Who cares?

00:05.618 --> 00:07.287
Who cares? Everybody.

00:07.345 --> 00:08.411
We love live TV.

00:08.479 --> 00:09.578
Do we, Lemon?

00:09.725 --> 00:12.080
Do you really love the
overzealous studio audience

00:12.081 --> 00:13.465
who will applaud at anything?

00:13.597 --> 00:16.456
Here in the greatest city on earth,
New York City, baby? Whassup?

00:20.768 --> 00:23.009
Wait, what are you saying, Jack?

00:23.094 --> 00:24.419
'Cause "TGS" is live.

00:24.544 --> 00:25.636
Not any more.

00:25.711 --> 00:27.134
It's financially impractical.

00:27.187 --> 00:29.778
From now on, you write and shoot
the whole season in two weeks

00:29.830 --> 00:32.299
like "Wheel of fortune" or FOX news.

00:33.761 --> 00:34.366
No.

00:34.386 --> 00:36.482
I mean, I grew up on live TV.

00:36.568 --> 00:38.287
Friday night in my parents basement.

00:38.387 --> 00:40.020
A telethon and cheese steaks.

00:40.276 --> 00:42.346
I can see it like it was yesterday.

00:43.918 --> 00:46.573
Best prom night ever!

00:50.113 --> 00:53.381
I'm going to lose my
virginity in nine years.

00:55.432 --> 00:56.925
"TGS" has to be live

00:56.947 --> 00:59.257
or it will lose all the
excitement and spontaneity.

00:59.430 --> 01:01.366
That's the beauty of live TV.

01:01.493 --> 01:03.413
Anything can happen.

01:04.297 --> 01:05.594
There's a bathroom in here

01:05.618 --> 01:08.986
you can use, sir Paul McCartney.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:21.546 --> 01:22.541
See?

01:22.582 --> 01:23.423
Awesome.

01:23.720 --> 01:24.723
Yes.

01:24.857 --> 01:26.324
But my way is cheaper,

01:26.347 --> 01:28.981
and you only have to work
two weeks out of the year.

01:29.465 --> 01:30.868
I want to go to there.

01:32.475 --> 01:33.397
So it's settled.

01:33.436 --> 01:35.891
Tonight is PGS's final live show.

01:35.979 --> 01:37.018
What?

01:37.014 --> 01:39.839
No, live television is
an American tradition.

01:39.870 --> 01:41.236
You can't just throw it away!

01:41.276 --> 01:42.275
Sorry, Kenneth.

01:42.329 --> 01:43.560
It's a done deal.

01:43.923 --> 01:45.940
Our last live show?

01:46.906 --> 01:48.649
No.

s06 ep19 - Live from studio, east coast

02:07.159 --> 02:10.658
sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

02:12.607 --> 02:15.669
There's a rumor spreading
around here like wildfire.

02:15.706 --> 02:17.816
But unlike the wildfires
I've started,

02:17.839 --> 02:20.197
this one doesn't sexually arouse me.

02:20.979 --> 02:21.923
It's true, Hazel.

02:21.924 --> 02:24.425
Tonight will be our last
live show but don't worry.

02:24.455 --> 02:25.520
It won't affect you.

02:25.550 --> 02:26.967
Unless my plan all along

02:26.968 --> 02:28.832
was to run on stage during a sketch

02:28.833 --> 02:30.642
and get discovered by Hollywood.

02:37.043 --> 02:38.163
Liz.

02:38.179 --> 02:39.745
An important me-nouncement.

02:40.109 --> 02:42.478
Paul and I have decided
to get married.

02:42.547 --> 02:43.947
Oh. Wow.

02:44.047 --> 02:47.219
And I told Paul that he should
propose to me tonight on tg...

02:47.245 --> 02:49.705
- Absolutely not!
- You didn't let me finish.

02:49.766 --> 02:50.583
S.

02:51.332 --> 02:53.432
Jen, come one, it's our last live show!

02:53.472 --> 02:54.424
Exactly!

02:54.461 --> 02:56.642
And it's Jenna Maroney
is getting engaged,

02:56.658 --> 02:58.341
it's going to be on live TV.

02:58.645 --> 03:01.652
I've been working on my
reaction since I was 3.

03:01.846 --> 03:02.684
Aaah!

03:09.281 --> 03:10.905
It's happening, Liz.

03:12.427 --> 03:13.297
Miss Lemon,

03:13.298 --> 03:16.779
Mr. Donaghy just discovered you
can get pornography on the Internet.

03:17.136 --> 03:17.933
Oh, my gosh.

03:17.968 --> 03:19.273
He's going to die in there.

03:24.882 --> 03:25.714
What's going on?

03:26.375 --> 03:27.634
You called a meeting, Lemon.

03:27.826 --> 03:29.801
Actually, I called it.

03:29.846 --> 03:30.996
Gasp!

03:33.199 --> 03:35.277
Live television is sacred,

03:35.441 --> 03:37.363
and we are not leaving this room

03:37.371 --> 03:40.577
until the 12 of us have
agreed to defend her.

03:41.342 --> 03:43.573
There is a great American play

03:43.604 --> 03:46.941
that was first written and
performed for live television.

03:47.035 --> 03:48.924
It's called "12 angry men."

03:49.119 --> 03:51.613
No, we are not debating
this like a jury.

03:51.666 --> 03:52.643
Shut him down, Jack.

03:52.698 --> 03:54.689
"12 angry men" is
preposterous Kenneth.

03:54.945 --> 03:58.372
11 decent Americans are swayed
by Jane Fonda's father?

03:58.417 --> 03:59.532
Open the door.

04:04.649 --> 04:06.499
How long do you think
you'll get away with this?

04:06.560 --> 04:09.841
Hazel or Jenna will know
that we're missing.

04:10.659 --> 04:12.889
Have an amazing set
tonight, everyone.

04:12.903 --> 04:14.517
I love you all.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.175
Tonight, night, Hazel.

04:16.219 --> 04:18.039
I do my surprise cameleo

04:18.079 --> 04:20.593
it goes viral, I take
medicine for it.

04:20.612 --> 04:22.710
Next stop, Hollywood, Florida

04:22.734 --> 04:24.155
to get the car from my mom.

04:24.161 --> 04:27.048
Next stop, California,
piece of kitchen.

04:27.106 --> 04:29.251
Tell my old boss, suck it.

04:29.283 --> 04:31.067
Next stop, tinseltown,

04:31.113 --> 04:34.251
because Christmas decorations are
really cheap this time of year.

04:35.327 --> 04:39.059
Nothing brings our country
together like live television.

04:39.150 --> 04:41.939
In studio 6h, it's a
part of that tradition.

04:42.063 --> 04:45.747
Why it was right here that NBC
broadcast the final episode

04:45.802 --> 04:47.935
of the 1950s classic

04:47.967 --> 04:49.791
"The Lovebirds."

04:50.642 --> 04:53.585
It's the grandpa replacement comedy hour

04:53.610 --> 04:56.192
sponsored by Kraft Singles.

04:56.247 --> 04:59.481
Make it with milk, is the cheese
that won World War II.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.818
And now,
"The Lovebirds."

05:02.858 --> 05:05.661
Starring Cubby Gilmore
and Loretta Fields.

05:08.643 --> 05:10.410
I'm home, baby.

05:13.948 --> 05:15.548
And I could eat a horse.

05:16.460 --> 05:19.466
Don't you dare touch that
bacon till it's done, Larry.

05:19.794 --> 05:22.521
Ooooooh.

05:23.438 --> 05:26.811
Ooooo-boy.

05:27.469 --> 05:30.196
Oh, brother,
now I'm cooking a Turkey, too.

05:31.504 --> 05:32.626
That's rich.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.591
One of these days, I'm
going to take a shot and blam!

05:35.592 --> 05:37.131
And blow your face off.

05:38.566 --> 05:40.687
It would still be
better than our honeymoon.

05:41.559 --> 05:44.177
What was wrong with Niagara Falls?

05:44.610 --> 05:46.872
Your mother found it chilly.

05:48.228 --> 05:49.592
You're a real cut-up.

05:49.806 --> 05:52.583
In fact, one of these days I'm
gonna cut you up in pieces

05:52.584 --> 05:54.355
and feed you to the neighbor's dogs.

05:54.879 --> 05:58.171
It will be the first time you've
taken me out for dinner in years.

05:58.927 --> 06:01.372
Keep it up, Doris and bang, zoom,

06:01.396 --> 06:04.568
I'm going to drown you in the bathtub
and say a mental patient did it.

06:05.505 --> 06:07.552
Like I always say...

06:07.819 --> 06:09.056
Aaaaachh.

06:11.210 --> 06:12.723
That's a funny thing to say.

06:12.773 --> 06:14.004
This is real.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.863
Real heart attack.

06:16.936 --> 06:19.050
Here, eat the bacon.

06:19.118 --> 06:20.702
It'll lubricate your heart.

06:20.749 --> 06:21.927
Ride it out.

06:21.966 --> 06:24.466
Ride it to hell.

06:25.091 --> 06:27.813
Come on now, Larry.
Don't be a sissy...

06:29.539 --> 06:31.655
I'm having a heart attack, too.

06:32.119 --> 06:33.805
My marriage is a sham.

06:33.832 --> 06:35.838
My makeup lady is my lover.

06:41.008 --> 06:44.770
Hello.
I'm Nazi doctor Heinrich Spaceman.

06:45.181 --> 06:46.529
I mean doctor.

06:46.963 --> 06:48.596
We can edit that out, right?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.156
Oh, it's live!

06:51.227 --> 06:54.151
Are you a modern housewife
who is in the family way?

06:54.196 --> 06:56.476
Smoke Chattertons cigarettes.

06:56.706 --> 07:00.293
Your baby's lungs need refreshing
nicotine for science reasons.

07:00.331 --> 07:03.132
And his growing bones need
tar to hold them together.

07:03.529 --> 07:06.506
Nine out of ten doctors
surveyed said, <i>who is this</i> ?

07:06.520 --> 07:08.293
Why are you calling so late?

07:08.747 --> 07:10.869
But the tenth guy was into it.

07:12.567 --> 07:15.456
♪ Chattertons tastes so cool and mild

07:15.509 --> 07:18.344
♪ a treat for you and
your unborn child ♪

07:28.758 --> 07:30.695
Jenna, remember that package

07:30.695 --> 07:32.621
you made me take to
Singapore last summer?

07:32.644 --> 07:35.486
I just got out of Changi prison.

07:36.631 --> 07:39.921
Thank you.
Just portion control and exercise.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.999
Paul!

07:48.025 --> 07:49.639
Did you pick up the ring?

07:49.677 --> 07:51.227
Liza minnelli's baby tooth

07:51.280 --> 07:54.915
surrounded by rubies that passed
through a terrified Michael Kors.

07:56.416 --> 07:58.770
It'll look amazing on camera.

07:59.669 --> 08:01.883
Look . I don't want
to propose on TV.

08:01.903 --> 08:03.122
I want it to be private.

08:03.184 --> 08:04.642
What are you saying, Paul?

08:04.862 --> 08:06.331
Rick Santorum is right.

08:06.644 --> 08:09.395
Marriage is a sacred union
between a man and a woman.

08:09.932 --> 08:11.821
Which is why I'm asking you right now

08:11.900 --> 08:13.667
to make me the luckiest schman...

08:15.876 --> 08:19.881
Look, I'm sorry to play the
biological woman card here,

08:20.069 --> 08:22.687
but according to Roe V. Dwyane Wade,

08:23.942 --> 08:25.210
I have a right to choose.

08:25.249 --> 08:27.834
And I choose a televised proposal.

08:27.895 --> 08:29.210
If you can't give me that,

08:29.211 --> 08:30.875
I'm not sure what my answer will be.

08:31.014 --> 08:32.794
Are you giving me an ultimatum?

08:32.998 --> 08:34.885
Look, I am the man here, Jenna.

08:34.910 --> 08:37.625
I may have a dress and a
wig and a gynecologist,

08:37.664 --> 08:39.554
but I am the man.

08:45.552 --> 08:47.222
Without live TV,

08:47.267 --> 08:49.995
think of the amazing moments
we would have missed.

08:50.044 --> 08:51.403
The moon landing.

08:51.521 --> 08:52.719
The Beatles.

08:52.751 --> 08:54.607
"The voice" results show.

08:54.665 --> 08:56.274
That time Mr. Lutz was an extra

08:56.359 --> 08:58.249
and he got so nervous he threw up.

08:58.310 --> 09:00.210
No, don't remind him.

09:00.760 --> 09:02.228
Oh, I had veal.

09:02.257 --> 09:04.233
I had veal with cheese on it.

09:05.325 --> 09:07.471
And what about Joey Montero's

09:07.518 --> 09:09.102
old variety show?

09:09.180 --> 09:11.100
He was just like you, Mr. Jordan,

09:11.101 --> 09:13.082
because he didn't want to rehearse

09:13.083 --> 09:14.510
and he wanted to get out of there

09:14.533 --> 09:16.345
as soon as possible.

10:48.159 --> 10:51.958
I just burped up clams casino
which is weird 'cause I didn't have any.

10:52.240 --> 10:55.341
well, hello there glasess.

10:55.910 --> 10:56.677
Glamour.

10:56.745 --> 10:57.872
Excitement.

10:57.933 --> 11:00.733
What we today would call alcoholism.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.225
Live television had everything.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.561
Well, not everything.

11:04.588 --> 11:05.916
Where were the black people?

11:05.967 --> 11:06.976
Oh.

11:07.085 --> 11:08.889
Actually, Mr. Spurlock,

11:08.883 --> 11:12.143
NBC had the first two
black characters on TV.

11:12.313 --> 11:13.295
Sort of.

11:13.331 --> 11:15.205
For "Alfie and Abner," NBC hired

11:15.227 --> 11:17.970
one African-American
and one Caucasian

11:17.999 --> 11:19.640
because they thought two black
people on the same show

11:19.660 --> 11:21.179
would make the audience nervous.

11:21.444 --> 11:24.170
A rule NBC still uses today.

11:28.933 --> 11:31.152
Abner, I'm home from work.

11:31.222 --> 11:33.313
Where are you, my brother?

11:33.382 --> 11:35.530
Here I is, Alfie.

11:41.689 --> 11:44.102
Oh, hell no. I am not doing this.

11:46.348 --> 11:49.426
NBC received a lot
of complaints...

11:49.534 --> 11:52.452
That the show wasn't on often enough.

11:52.536 --> 11:55.346
So they forced Theodore Freeman
to honor his contract.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.272
I's done stole this catfish.

12:01.192 --> 12:03.660
Sir, I am asking
you as a human being

12:03.799 --> 12:05.811
so please stop talking like that.

12:05.990 --> 12:08.318
I's gonna eat it
till I'm bellyful.

12:10.004 --> 12:12.321
This is debasing to both of us.

12:12.409 --> 12:14.710
I was a tuskegee airman.

12:14.946 --> 12:16.953
Zip-a-Dee-goo-goo.

12:18.222 --> 12:19.448
You may anger me,

12:19.471 --> 12:22.965
but I believe nonviolence
is the path to change.

12:23.018 --> 12:26.491
And I believes you can
catch a rainbow in your hat.

12:26.846 --> 12:29.580
I'll kill you, you ignorant

12:31.724 --> 12:35.169
believe it or not, they
did not stop doing the show,

12:35.428 --> 12:38.794
which made for tense
but thrilling live TV.

12:48.226 --> 12:50.226
Banjo...

12:57.335 --> 12:57.997
Kenneth.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.173
I've frankly lost track

12:59.174 --> 13:00.975
of what you were trying
to convince us of

13:00.976 --> 13:03.291
with these detailed descriptions
of television shows.

13:03.557 --> 13:05.038
Thank you.

13:05.440 --> 13:06.309
Come on.

13:06.346 --> 13:08.599
Times change.
Television replaced radio.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.300
Cars replaced horses.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.030
Not where I'm from.

13:12.055 --> 13:15.175
Are you telling me the mayor
of your hometown is a car?

13:15.993 --> 13:16.964
Pretty weird.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.097
Why are you laughing at me?

13:20.354 --> 13:22.625
Okay.
Let's all take a little break.

13:25.119 --> 13:28.023
Hello.
I'm Nazi doctor Leo Speceman.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.066
I know it's live, I want people to know.

13:31.999 --> 13:34.842
Did your mother smoke Chatterton
cigarettes while pregnant

13:34.865 --> 13:36.857
during the 1950s or 60s?

13:36.887 --> 13:39.498
If she did, you
probably can't hear me

13:39.521 --> 13:41.931
because of fetal
Chatterton syndrome.

13:42.031 --> 13:44.142
Turn up the volume!

13:44.734 --> 13:46.554
Recent study is it show that

13:46.553 --> 13:48.287
while pregnancy is disgusting,

13:48.691 --> 13:51.482
babies do not need tar or nicotine.

13:51.659 --> 13:54.346
If you are currently suffering
from Chatterton syndrome,

13:54.384 --> 13:58.005
please, use your Bird-like
claws to dial the number below

13:58.636 --> 14:01.099
then use the rectum you have
instead of a mouth

14:01.144 --> 14:03.781
to say something like "wrulgh" or

14:03.884 --> 14:05.217
"thunghth"

14:05.237 --> 14:09.069
to signify that you wish to join a
class action suit against Chattertons.

14:10.105 --> 14:12.658
♪ If you have scales instead of skin

14:12.885 --> 14:15.736
♪pick up the phone suit the Chattertons.

14:19.660 --> 14:20.740
All right. This is idiotic.

14:20.770 --> 14:22.116
We've got a show to do it and...

14:22.177 --> 14:23.433
Oh, my God, Kenneth.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.601
It's my period.

14:24.663 --> 14:25.696
It's a-gonna blow.

14:27.543 --> 14:30.309
We both know you're not
due for another nine days.

14:31.072 --> 14:33.563
And I'm ashamed of you, Ms. Lemon.

14:33.608 --> 14:36.376
Think of your hero, Rosemary Howard.

14:36.445 --> 14:39.835
She wrote for the edgiest live
variety show of all time,

14:39.912 --> 14:42.356
"The Gruber Brother and Nipsey."

14:44.550 --> 14:48.068
Hey, Nipsey, what do you get when
you cross a chicken with a hippie?

14:48.129 --> 14:49.271
I don't know, Dickie.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.846
What do you get when you cross
a chicken with a hippie?

14:52.064 --> 14:55.075
I don't know, but LBJ
likes them both fried.

14:55.182 --> 14:56.281
Lay it on me.

14:57.787 --> 14:59.058
Lay it on me.

15:00.302 --> 15:01.957
Lay it on me.

15:03.967 --> 15:05.651
Lay it on me.

15:06.683 --> 15:08.320
Now, as you know, Nipsey...

15:08.333 --> 15:10.771
I'm the first streaker.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.834
Streaking's the new thing.

15:13.026 --> 15:14.877
We touched penises.

15:16.218 --> 15:19.779
We interrupt this program to bring
you an NBC news special report.

15:20.027 --> 15:21.319
From Rockefeller center,

15:21.320 --> 15:23.150
Chet Huntley and David Brinkley.

15:25.541 --> 15:26.150
Good evening.

15:26.163 --> 15:28.118
NBC news has learned that
less than an hour ago

15:28.157 --> 15:31.105
there was an explosion aboard
the Apollo 13 spacecraft.

15:31.250 --> 15:32.831
- David?
- Thank you, Chet.

15:33.415 --> 15:34.214
Chet?

15:34.291 --> 15:35.090
Thank you, David.

15:35.658 --> 15:37.588
We are awaiting further information.
David?

15:37.985 --> 15:38.751
Thank you, Chet.

15:39.147 --> 15:41.198
Let's go to the manned
space center in Houston

15:41.199 --> 15:43.379
and our reporter on the scene, Mr.
Jamie Garnett.

15:43.433 --> 15:44.499
Jamie?

15:44.621 --> 15:45.934
Thank you, Chet and David.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.290
I'm sorry, sweetheart, could you
move out of the way of our camera?

15:48.438 --> 15:50.865
We need to talk to our new
reporter Jamie Garnett.

15:50.957 --> 15:52.073
Now, where is he?

15:52.354 --> 15:53.720
I'm Jamie Garnett, gentlemen.

15:53.789 --> 15:56.277
I spoke earlier with NASA
flight director Glynn Lunney...

15:56.394 --> 15:58.568
Listen, doll, you're
not making any sense.

15:59.855 --> 16:01.952
You're probably hysterical
from menstruation.

16:01.983 --> 16:04.136
Go lie down and make sure
you get plenty of iron.

16:04.168 --> 16:05.586
Maybe eat a ham salad...

16:06.722 --> 16:09.023
And I'm being told that
commander James Lovell...

16:09.047 --> 16:10.479
Honey, you have a dynamite shape,

16:10.480 --> 16:11.891
but you're going to have to shut up

16:11.892 --> 16:13.543
and let a man tell
us what's happening.

16:14.276 --> 16:17.334
Now, is your father or
a policeman nearby?

16:18.246 --> 16:20.445
Look, where did you find
that microphone, sugar mouth?

16:20.521 --> 16:21.803
Was it just lying
there on the ground?

16:21.896 --> 16:23.500
Where is Jamie Garnett?

16:23.536 --> 16:27.776
This just in, male NBC news
reporter Jamie Garnett is missing.

16:28.125 --> 16:29.840
I'm right here you mother...

16:30.212 --> 16:33.264
Classic live television.

16:33.441 --> 16:35.335
And while they never
found Jamie Garnett,

16:35.774 --> 16:39.308
that woman who stole his
microphone went on to become

16:39.529 --> 16:40.607
a wife.

16:42.324 --> 16:44.893
Has Paul not come back?
He's not answering his phone.

16:44.966 --> 16:45.871
What have I done?

16:45.914 --> 16:47.467
Calm down.
Paul's gone,

16:47.468 --> 16:49.661
but you're getting proposed
to on the show tonight.

16:49.732 --> 16:50.622
By me.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.693
This is New York state bitch,

16:51.746 --> 16:54.046
anyone can marry anything now.

16:54.564 --> 16:55.089
What?
But...

16:55.121 --> 16:56.500
Come on. Everything you want,

16:56.531 --> 16:58.564
think what great TV this will be.

16:58.627 --> 16:59.453
It's all you want.

16:59.485 --> 17:01.654
No, it's not what I want.

17:01.842 --> 17:03.709
Paul is everything I want.

17:03.771 --> 17:05.357
He's the reason to get married,

17:05.406 --> 17:06.595
not TV.

17:07.054 --> 17:08.743
Rick Santorum was right.

17:09.126 --> 17:10.892
How could I have been so blind?

17:11.070 --> 17:12.872
Because you're a horrible person?

17:13.503 --> 17:16.808
Thank you.
Just portion control and lots of water.

17:20.380 --> 17:23.105
All in favor of
keeping "TGS" live?

17:24.604 --> 17:26.973
It's still not unanimous.
And it never will be.

17:27.018 --> 17:28.169
This is a business, Kenneth, and

17:28.247 --> 17:29.768
if live TV went away,

17:29.807 --> 17:32.556
the only thing that would change
would be NBC's profit margin.

17:32.789 --> 17:34.298
That's not true, Jackie d.

17:35.693 --> 17:37.510
Oh, come on, that
wasn't that dramatic.

17:38.032 --> 17:39.658
Live TV changed my life.

17:39.803 --> 17:42.091
In 1986 my church dance crew

17:42.134 --> 17:44.078
performed on a regional telethon.

17:44.131 --> 17:45.463
It was my big break.

17:45.741 --> 17:46.582
Flashback.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.151
This is for you, Jesus.

18:00.274 --> 18:02.862

18:04.781 --> 18:07.913
Coccyx is the scientific
term for your butt bone.

18:09.109 --> 18:11.051
Why are you all laughing?

18:13.345 --> 18:14.745
I like it.

18:15.052 --> 18:15.928
Coccyx.

Coccyx.

18:17.656 --> 18:18.591
You know what this is?

18:18.622 --> 18:20.326
This is the garry-o-many core.

18:23.117 --> 18:24.438
Oh, my God.

18:25.143 --> 18:26.428
I remember that.

18:27.430 --> 18:28.597
That was you?

18:28.629 --> 18:31.186
That's when I realized
I was a ridiculous man.

18:31.230 --> 18:32.861
Tracy, I was there.

18:32.996 --> 18:34.705
As a lower-level GE employee,

18:34.721 --> 18:36.861
I was answering phones
at that telethon.

18:36.892 --> 18:38.094
When you took off your clothes,

18:38.124 --> 18:39.927
they cut to the phone banks.

18:39.989 --> 18:40.955
Gasp.

18:41.016 --> 18:43.190
I made a hilarious prank call

18:43.221 --> 18:44.471
to that telethon.

18:45.048 --> 18:46.813
Did the man who answered the phone

18:46.814 --> 18:49.676
sound like he had the piercing
blue eyes of an ice dragon?

18:50.323 --> 18:51.344
Yes.

18:53.158 --> 18:57.604
Hello, I'd like to speak
to General Electric.

18:58.729 --> 19:00.061
Madam,

19:02.810 --> 19:05.170
I'm afraid you're confused.

19:05.701 --> 19:07.421
I was a nurse in the war

19:07.453 --> 19:09.306
and I met him when he
was just a colonel.

19:09.346 --> 19:11.417
He's the father of my child.

19:11.906 --> 19:14.141
General Electric is not a person.

19:15.046 --> 19:17.791
Toby, come talk to your father.

19:17.918 --> 19:20.910
Daddy, it's your
son, Toby electric.

19:23.158 --> 19:24.975
I can tell by your voice that

19:25.004 --> 19:27.587
you are a very ungainly teenage girl from

19:28.173 --> 19:30.067
southeastern Pennsylvania.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.322
Ah-ha, ya burnt.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.722
How you like me now?

19:34.874 --> 19:37.798
Young lady, no one... no one

19:37.893 --> 19:40.069
jokes down General Electric.

19:40.125 --> 19:43.125
And if I ever...

19:48.839 --> 19:50.239
Do you mind?

19:52.375 --> 19:53.495
If I ever

19:54.063 --> 19:56.692
get my thick,
manly hands on you,

19:56.693 --> 19:59.131
I will roast you alive in
an oven I design myself,

19:59.163 --> 20:01.365
using two, no, three kinds of heat.

20:01.698 --> 20:03.915
I'm Jack Donaghy, damn it.

20:05.509 --> 20:07.403
Watching you get
all red-faced on TV,

20:08.161 --> 20:10.054
that was the night I
found my calling...

20:10.224 --> 20:11.480
Sticking it to the man.

20:11.605 --> 20:13.533
You know what?
That night changed my life, too.

20:13.550 --> 20:14.980
Don Geiss saw my

20:14.981 --> 20:17.359
loyalty/handsomeness and the next day

20:17.360 --> 20:20.701
he promoted me out of poisons
and into microwaves.

20:20.817 --> 20:23.569
Live TV made us all
what we are today.

20:24.255 --> 20:25.714
No need to take another vote.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.374
"TGS" is meant to be live.

20:27.465 --> 20:28.550
To make it more profitable,

20:28.554 --> 20:31.117
we'll just do more sponsor
product placements

20:31.170 --> 20:33.825
you should do it with the
upcoming Warner Brothers movie,

20:33.856 --> 20:35.076
"Rock of Ages," based on
the hit Broadway musical.

20:53.623 --> 20:54.891
Paul didn't come.

20:54.934 --> 20:56.142
I ruined everything.

20:56.164 --> 20:57.470
Yeah, you blew it.

20:57.536 --> 21:00.749
So I'll just jump out at some
point and lez it up with you?

21:01.129 --> 21:02.152
Okay.
