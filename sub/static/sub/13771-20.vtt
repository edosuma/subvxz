So, there I was,
innocently paying the bills,

01:15.379 --> 01:19.079
when I was suddenly slapped
in the face by a charge for $45.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.689
Took me almost an hour

01:20.776 --> 01:23.996
to sniff out your little rathole
behind the refrigerator.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.955
Would you care
to explain these?

01:26.042 --> 01:27.870
Hal, I'm sorry.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.264
Lois, we are poor!

01:30.351 --> 01:32.483
I thought we had
an understanding.

01:32.570 --> 01:36.096
I know. You're right, Hal.
I just saw them in the store.

01:36.183 --> 01:37.923
And they're not real
Christian Louboutins.

01:38.010 --> 01:39.534
They're just a cheap knockoff.

01:39.621 --> 01:41.927
I just wanted to try them on,
just for a second.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.364
And then I saw them
in the mirror,

01:43.451 --> 01:45.627
and they looked so elegant
and glamorous,

01:45.714 --> 01:48.238
and I guess I just wanted
for once in my life

01:48.325 --> 01:52.503
to see what it would
feel like to be pretty.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.550
Oh, please,
I invented that act!

01:56.899 --> 01:58.509
Everyone says they'll economize,

01:58.596 --> 02:00.250
but I'm the only one
rinsing out baggies.

02:00.337 --> 02:02.905
I'm the only one splitting
two-ply toilet paper.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.429
I'm the only one snacking
out of birdfeeders!

02:05.516 --> 02:07.039
Look at this!

02:07.127 --> 02:10.565
$18 for a three-minute...

02:10.651 --> 02:12.393

[muttering phone number]

What's your name, baby?

02:23.534 --> 02:25.884
This is... Are you aware
kids call these numbers?!

02:25.971 --> 02:27.930
Put some clothes on!

02:28.017 --> 02:31.325
[muttering]
Oh! Just can't believe people.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.501
WOMAN [sultry voice]:
Yeah, baby,

02:33.588 --> 02:36.939
would you like that?

02:37.026 --> 02:39.550
Oh, you just love not
responding, don't you?

02:39.637 --> 02:41.509
You're such a bad boy.

02:41.596 --> 02:45.991
Well, big spender, I can keep
going as long as you can.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.995
And that slapshot

02:50.082 --> 02:52.128
you took totally turned
the game around!

02:52.215 --> 02:53.651
Well, I wasn't aiming
right for his mouth,

02:53.738 --> 02:55.175
but sometimes
you get lucky.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.654
You guys are not gonna believe
what happened!

02:56.741 --> 02:58.090
I was at the college,
checking out the trees

02:58.178 --> 02:59.788
over by the sorority houses,

02:59.875 --> 03:03.705
and then this guy comes up to me
and asks if I wanted a job!

03:03.792 --> 03:06.142
Experimental drug testing?

03:06.229 --> 03:07.361
He must've thought
I was in college

03:07.448 --> 03:08.318
because of my binoculars
and everything.

03:08.405 --> 03:09.667
Can you believe it?

03:09.754 --> 03:11.800
They pay people
just to take pills!

03:11.887 --> 03:13.584
Why is anyone
doing anything else?

03:13.671 --> 03:14.672
Reese, this is
the kind of job

03:14.759 --> 03:16.108
they give to guys
on death row.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.936
Yeah, and I'm totally skipping
that part.

03:20.504 --> 03:21.636
Jamie, get out of here.

03:21.723 --> 03:22.898
I have to...

03:28.382 --> 03:31.298
LOIS: Francis, I am not going
to ask you again!

03:31.385 --> 03:33.300
You tell me where
you hid my pearl necklace!

03:33.387 --> 03:34.605
Somewhere you'll
never find it!

03:34.692 --> 03:35.954
I have a hiding place
so perfect,

03:36.041 --> 03:37.173
you could look
for a hundred years

03:37.260 --> 03:38.696
and it won't matter!

03:38.783 --> 03:40.524
Your earrings, your necklace,
your bracelet,

03:40.611 --> 03:43.092
all your meaningless
material possessions

03:43.179 --> 03:45.050
you hold so dear,
gone forever!

03:45.137 --> 03:47.052
Now I can go to
military school

03:47.139 --> 03:48.532
knowing you're as
miserable as I am

03:48.619 --> 03:51.013
'cause you'll never
find it! Ever!

03:51.100 --> 03:53.189
[high-pitched laugh]

03:54.799 --> 03:57.062
The stash.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.368
Jamie, where did you...?

03:58.455 --> 03:59.456
The stash?!

03:59.543 --> 04:00.849
What about the stash?

04:00.936 --> 04:02.503
I didn't say anything
about the stash.

04:02.590 --> 04:04.983
I think I heard you
very clearly say "the stash."

04:05.070 --> 04:06.333
We don't talk
about the stash

04:06.420 --> 04:07.769
unless we found
the stash.

04:07.856 --> 04:09.249
I didn't find the stash!

04:09.336 --> 04:12.513
Okay, but I suggest
you remember our deal.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.471
If any of us does find it,

04:14.558 --> 04:16.125
we split Mom's reward
three ways.

04:16.212 --> 04:19.607
Because we're brothers
and we love each other.

04:24.176 --> 04:25.830
Malcolm, come on!

04:25.917 --> 04:27.136
We're going to be late!

04:27.223 --> 04:27.876
All right, all right,
I'm coming.

04:29.617 --> 04:30.922
Why aren't you wearing
your smock?

04:31.009 --> 04:31.880
Because the longer
I don't put it on,

04:31.967 --> 04:33.534
the longer I can pretend

04:33.621 --> 04:35.492
I don't work in that
soul-killing fluorescent tomb.

04:35.579 --> 04:36.972
As shocking
as it may sound to you,

04:37.059 --> 04:39.366
I don't actually like
stocking wart cream

04:39.453 --> 04:41.977
and telling 80-year-olds
which diapers leak the least.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.110
"Thank you, Mother,
for getting me a job

04:45.197 --> 04:46.460
so I don't have to be a bum
on the street."

04:46.547 --> 04:48.200
"You're welcome."

04:48.288 --> 04:49.680
"Can I open
the door for you,

04:49.767 --> 04:51.116
after everything
you've sacrificed for me?"

04:51.203 --> 04:52.553
"Why, that's very thoughtful
of you."

04:52.640 --> 04:54.555
You really got to stop
being such a snob.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.600
There's pride in doing
anything well.

04:56.687 --> 04:57.775
I'd rather you were

04:57.862 --> 04:59.473
the best toilet scrubber
in the world

04:59.560 --> 05:01.388
than a slapdash
Supreme Court justice.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.128
And how about showing me
a little bit gratitude?

05:03.215 --> 05:06.306
There's nothing embarrassing
about working at Lucky Aide.

05:08.090 --> 05:10.962
[slurred]:
Listen to your mother.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.225
She's a beautiful, foxy lady.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.793
Heh. [groans softly]

05:17.578 --> 05:19.101
Okay,

05:19.188 --> 05:20.537
everything looks great.
You're young.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.017
You're in excellent health.

05:22.104 --> 05:23.671
You're a perfect candidate
for this study.

05:23.758 --> 05:26.108
Now, one last question:

05:26.195 --> 05:28.328
are you taking
any other medications?

05:28.415 --> 05:29.938
Of course not.

05:30.939 --> 05:31.940
Of course not.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.508
Of course not.

05:35.726 --> 05:37.249
Of course not.

05:38.294 --> 05:40.688
Of course not.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.429
WOMAN:
Billing. Can I help you?

05:42.516 --> 05:45.040
Yes! I've just spent
the last half hour trying

05:45.127 --> 05:46.650
to explain to you people!

05:46.737 --> 05:49.827
You cannot charge me
$800 for a phone call

05:49.914 --> 05:51.220
I never agreed to!

05:51.307 --> 05:53.614
This is wrong and unethical!

05:53.701 --> 05:55.355
You're absolutely
right, sir.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.009
-We're bad.
-What?

05:58.096 --> 06:00.621
We've been very bad,
and we need to be punished.

06:00.708 --> 06:01.883
What would you like
to do to us?

06:01.970 --> 06:03.232
I don't want
to do anything to you!

06:03.319 --> 06:04.755
Whatever you want, big boy.

06:04.842 --> 06:06.235
You're the one paying
for this call.

06:06.322 --> 06:07.715
Ooh! Ooh!

06:07.802 --> 06:09.543
Malcolm!

06:09.630 --> 06:10.935
Malcolm!

06:11.022 --> 06:12.110
Did you hear the news?

06:12.197 --> 06:14.330
They fired Sam
the stilt guy!

06:14.417 --> 06:16.245
Word is he puked
into the sunroof

06:16.332 --> 06:17.551
of the boss's El Dorado.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.422
This is bad, Malcolm,
really bad.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.859
Bad? He's been coming
to work drunk for 20 years.

06:21.946 --> 06:24.384
I meant bad for me.

06:24.471 --> 06:25.646
This means they're
paying attention!

06:25.733 --> 06:26.995
Sam was my canary.

06:27.082 --> 06:29.476
Now my work has
to speak for itself!

06:29.563 --> 06:31.652
Don't say I never
listen to you, Malcolm.

06:31.739 --> 06:34.132
I had to lobby hard
for you, but...

06:34.219 --> 06:36.047
you're replacing Sam.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.746
It's 30 cents an hour more;
you get to work outside

06:38.833 --> 06:40.791
and wave to all your friends.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.230
This is so sweet.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.058
I'm gonna make
2,500 bucks

06:47.145 --> 06:49.409
and all I gotta do
is swallow 300 pills a day

06:49.496 --> 06:52.368
and sneak Jamie's urine
into a cup once in a while.

06:52.455 --> 06:56.546
Calonil, Frageset. Suppository.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.243
These taste the worst.

07:04.685 --> 07:09.690
Okay, Jamie, can you help your
favorite brother find the stash?

07:11.213 --> 07:13.824
Remember this, the necklace?

07:13.911 --> 07:17.132
You know what
I'm talking about, don't you?

07:17.219 --> 07:19.874
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

07:19.961 --> 07:23.094
Oh, my God! Where did you...?!

07:23.181 --> 07:26.576
Can you show Dewey
where you found this?

07:26.663 --> 07:28.056
Sure, you can.

07:28.143 --> 07:30.014
You show me where
you found this,

07:30.101 --> 07:32.147
and we can write
our ticket with Mom.

07:32.234 --> 07:36.064
We cut Malcolm and Reese out.
It's just you and me.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.460
Is it in the bathroom?

07:43.201 --> 07:45.247
Mom's underwear drawer?
Of course!

07:45.334 --> 07:47.858
She'd never think
of looking for it there.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.339
There's probably a false
bottom or something.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.123
LOIS: What are you doing?!

07:55.953 --> 07:58.260
God, look at the dump
this guy lives in.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.871
[doorbell playing tune]

08:00.958 --> 08:02.351
It's not bad enough
I have to take his job.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.744
Now I have to take his stilts
from him, too?

08:03.831 --> 08:05.310
Those stilts
are company property,

08:05.397 --> 08:07.443
and it's our responsibility
to get them back.

08:07.530 --> 08:08.705
It's nothing personal.

08:09.793 --> 08:11.012
Cough up
the stilts, alkie!

08:11.099 --> 08:12.970
No, no! Please
don't do this to me.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.276
I love my job!

08:14.363 --> 08:15.843
Malcolm, you gotta help me!

08:15.930 --> 08:17.148
Sam, I'm sorry.

08:17.235 --> 08:18.323
I feel really terrible
about this.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.847
Don't drag
this out, Malcolm.

08:19.934 --> 08:21.631
You got to crush him like a bug.

08:21.718 --> 08:22.937
It's kinder that way.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.504
You're a ghost, old man.

08:24.591 --> 08:25.679
No one can hear you.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.071
Malcolm, please!

08:27.158 --> 08:28.899
Just tell them
you won't do it.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.075
Then they'll have no choice.
They'll have to take me back!

08:31.162 --> 08:33.207
Please, I'm begging you.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.818
I'm Uncle Sam! Please!

08:35.905 --> 08:38.474
I have nothing else!
No family, no friends!

08:38.561 --> 08:41.129
This is my life! Please!

08:41.216 --> 08:43.784
You want me to kiss your ass
and call it ice cream?

08:43.871 --> 08:47.222
I'll do it!
I'll do it! Mm!

08:47.309 --> 08:48.397
It's ice cream!

08:48.484 --> 08:51.095
Mm! That's delicious ice cream!

08:51.182 --> 08:52.923
You know who has
delicious ice cream?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.621
That gas station down on Cedar.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.406
Smells a little funky,
but mm-mm-mm.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.321
Mm-mm. Malcolm, please!

08:59.408 --> 09:01.323
Mm-mm-mm. Please!

09:01.410 --> 09:03.194
Sam, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.414
No, no! No, no! Please!

09:05.501 --> 09:06.763
Okay, grab the suit

09:06.850 --> 09:09.157
and we'll get out
of Sam's hair.

09:09.244 --> 09:10.201
Please!

09:10.288 --> 09:11.463
Sorry, Sam.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.334
Please!

09:12.421 --> 09:13.683
Sorry.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.511
No, Malcolm!

09:15.598 --> 09:18.862
Sam, I'm sorry.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.168
Please!

09:20.255 --> 09:21.691
I'm really, really,
really sorry.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.955
Please! Please! Please!

09:25.042 --> 09:26.130
I'm sorry.

09:26.217 --> 09:27.436
Please!

09:27.523 --> 09:29.003

20:44.025 --> 20:46.201
We know what we're doing.
Thank you very much.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.899
Mom, Dad, the drugs
are wearing off!

20:48.986 --> 20:50.901
[whimpering]

20:51.859 --> 20:53.164
Sundance, baby, is that you?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.514
[horse whinnies]

20:58.518 --> 21:00.215
[panting]

21:04.567 --> 21:07.483
Will you listen to me?!
I found you a job!

21:07.570 --> 21:09.572
-What?
-I found you a job!

21:09.659 --> 21:11.008
I've been trying to tell you.

21:11.095 --> 21:12.967
It's perfect for you!

21:13.054 --> 21:15.491
It's at the circus!

21:17.014 --> 21:19.147
The circus?

21:19.234 --> 21:22.106
In what world do you depreciate

21:22.193 --> 21:24.935
an elephant over two years?!

21:25.022 --> 21:26.894
I want this all
redone tonight!

21:28.025 --> 21:29.592
What are you looking at?

21:29.679 --> 21:31.942
Get back to work!

21:32.029 --> 21:34.510
HAL: That is
fantastic, son!

21:34.597 --> 21:37.078
Reese's roommate in
detox is a lawyer.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.994
He thinks he can blackmail him
into defending his felony case!

21:40.081 --> 21:41.561
That's great.

21:41.648 --> 21:43.998
Hey, the feeling's coming back
to my thighs.

21:44.085 --> 21:46.348
Apparently, the medical term
for what happened to me is

21:46.435 --> 21:47.915
"Holy crap, come look at this,"

21:48.002 --> 21:50.134
because that's all
the ER guys kept saying.

21:50.221 --> 21:51.571
But if I ever have
to give birth,

21:51.658 --> 21:53.050
it'll be really easy.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.226
And Mom seems
to be in a good mood lately.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.619
DEWEY: The toilet's
backed up again!

21:56.706 --> 21:57.968
I'll get it.

22:02.886 --> 22:05.628
[heels clopping]
