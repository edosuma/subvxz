00:01.612 --> 00:02.941
Thank you old Gus,

00:03.066 --> 00:05.466
for brightening our lives,
our hearts

00:05.735 --> 00:07.423
and most importantly, our shoes.

00:09.676 --> 00:10.801
This truly is a day

00:10.969 --> 00:12.424
of mixed emotions for me.

00:12.933 --> 00:14.961
I'm sad that old Gus is leaving.

00:15.086 --> 00:17.874
But it allows me
to help Andy restart his life

00:17.999 --> 00:20.227
as pioneer hall's new shoeshine guy.

00:20.626 --> 00:23.060
I've been listening
to your boring speeches

00:23.185 --> 00:24.694
for the last 50 years.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.234
And now it's time for you
to listen to one of mine.

00:28.900 --> 00:32.148
You know, a day like this
makes a man reflect upon his life.

00:32.273 --> 00:36.270
And I've come to the conclusion
that I've completely wasted mine.

00:38.012 --> 00:39.747
And just for the record,

00:39.915 --> 00:42.342
I never ever liked
being called old Gus.

00:43.094 --> 00:44.460
I didn't understand it

00:44.628 --> 00:46.754
when I was in my 20's
and I sure hate it now.

00:47.189 --> 00:49.173
So go to hell,
every single one of you.

00:49.438 --> 00:52.214
Screw Pawnee
and screw your damn shoes.

00:55.329 --> 00:57.318
Old Gus is classic.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.038
So, I propose that we change

01:21.206 --> 01:23.926
our name, from the Subcommittee
for Pit Beautification,

01:24.051 --> 01:26.571
to the Subcommittee
for Lot Beautification.

01:27.350 --> 01:29.296
April, stop that.
Who are you texting?

01:29.464 --> 01:30.339
You.

01:31.868 --> 01:33.159
She's texting me.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.263
Sorry you're bored.

01:39.873 --> 01:41.517
Hey, everyone.
Hey, Ann.

01:42.393 --> 01:43.561
Can I talk to you?

01:43.729 --> 01:46.647
Fine. Tom, you're in charge.
Keep the momentum going.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.875
- Keep these minds working.
- Absolutely.

01:50.381 --> 01:53.070
Would you rather be able to fly
or speak fluent French?

01:53.238 --> 01:54.864
- Donna, go.
- French.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.575
I don't wanna freak you out,

01:56.700 --> 01:59.452
but another department
filed a planning claim for lot 48.

02:00.372 --> 02:01.203
Who?

02:05.288 --> 02:06.288
Damn it!

02:06.727 --> 02:07.979
The library?

02:08.930 --> 02:11.130
Pawnee's Library Department
is the most diabolical,

02:11.440 --> 02:13.424
ruthless bunch of bureaucrats
I've ever seen.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.169
They're like a biker gang.

02:15.579 --> 02:17.636
But instead of shotguns
and crystal meth,

02:18.160 --> 02:19.089
they use

02:19.372 --> 02:20.569
political savvy.

02:20.817 --> 02:21.967
And shushing.

02:22.772 --> 02:25.352
It's gonna be okay.
It's not a done deal.

02:26.023 --> 02:27.188
You're right.

02:27.356 --> 02:28.939
Thanks for pulling me out.

02:29.189 --> 02:30.316
I need a good plan.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.443
I don't want to cause a panic.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.404
News flash, we're screwed.
We got a big problem with the library.

02:35.732 --> 02:37.262
Punk ass book jockeys.

02:37.485 --> 02:39.286
Why do we hate the library?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.786
It's the worst group of people
ever assembled.

02:41.954 --> 02:43.788
They're mean, conniving, rude,

02:43.956 --> 02:46.040
and well read,
which makes them very dangerous.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.126
And they're trying to steal lot 48
for a new branch.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.294
What?

02:51.239 --> 02:52.622
- On 48?
- Yeah!

02:53.006 --> 02:56.008
I actually think a library
would be nice that close to my house.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.012
But I'm not about
to say that in there.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.305
A new branch?

03:01.856 --> 03:03.136
I hate them.

03:04.901 --> 03:06.847
We need to make contact
with someone there.

03:06.972 --> 03:09.271
Does anybody know anybody
that works at the library?

03:10.060 --> 03:11.982
Well, we actually kind of do.

03:12.737 --> 03:16.017
The new deputy director
of the department is Tammy Swanson.

03:16.734 --> 03:17.934
Ron's ex-wife?

03:18.408 --> 03:20.798
That's terrific.
Or is that awful?

03:20.923 --> 03:22.792
He hates her, but he knows her.

03:23.148 --> 03:25.246
Everything's okay.
Or is it just the same?

03:25.725 --> 03:27.248
You're thinking out loud again.

03:27.416 --> 03:28.754
Am I? I am.

03:29.411 --> 03:30.251
Of course,

03:30.419 --> 03:33.746
that bitch of an ex-wife
is working for the library now.

03:33.871 --> 03:35.090
That is perfect.

03:35.215 --> 03:39.018
The worst person in the world
working at the worst place in the world.

03:39.311 --> 03:41.720
I have to go talk to her.
Give me something I can use.

03:42.106 --> 03:43.556
Does she have any weaknesses?

03:45.142 --> 03:47.059
What do you mean no?
Everybody has one.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.377
Not machines.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.513
I honestly believe
that she was programmed

03:50.638 --> 03:53.639
by someone from the future
to come back and destroy all happiness.

03:53.816 --> 03:54.525
I see.

03:54.693 --> 03:57.137
Just, I knew that you had
two ex-wives named Tammy.

03:57.432 --> 03:59.905
So, I was hoping that there was one
that you got along with.

04:00.205 --> 04:01.505
I hate 'em both.

04:02.617 --> 04:03.637
On my death bed,

04:03.762 --> 04:07.204
my final wish is to have
my ex-wives rushed to my side,

04:07.372 --> 04:08.991
so I can use my dying breath

04:09.116 --> 04:11.816
to tell them both to go to hell,
one last time.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.845
Would I get married again?

04:13.970 --> 04:14.909
Absolutely.

04:15.034 --> 04:17.423
If you don't believe in love,
what's the point of living?

04:18.754 --> 04:21.863
I'm just looking forward
to a thoughtful debate with Tammy,

04:21.988 --> 04:25.139
about the relative merits
of Parks versus Libraries.

04:25.807 --> 04:29.051
And in case something bad goes down,
I wore my sharpest rings.

04:29.928 --> 04:31.270
This one will tear you up.

04:37.157 --> 04:39.412
I'm Leslie Knope.
I called a little while ago.

04:40.102 --> 04:42.740
You have a lot of nerve
showing your face here.

04:43.162 --> 04:44.162
Excuse me?

04:44.287 --> 04:46.076
You have overdue book fees

04:46.244 --> 04:47.870
totaling 3 dollars, Missy.

04:48.444 --> 04:49.774
That is so typical.

04:49.899 --> 04:53.459
I should've known you'd use a low blow,
dirty pool, B.S. move like that.

04:53.928 --> 04:56.808
That's why everybody hates the library.
Here's your 3 dollars.

04:57.135 --> 04:58.255
See you in hell.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.800
I was just kidding, dear God.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.078
You did have 3 dollars worth of fines,
but I cleared them.

05:05.811 --> 05:09.058
We government gals have to watch
each other's backs, right?

05:09.712 --> 05:11.920
I know this is a trap
but I don't know how.

05:13.173 --> 05:14.688
Did you talk to Ron?

05:16.091 --> 05:18.108
Ron tends to exaggerate

05:18.276 --> 05:19.660
when it comes to me.

05:19.899 --> 05:22.099
I swear, I don't have cloven feet.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.073
Sit down.

05:26.161 --> 05:28.089
<i>Shine, shine, shine your shoes?</i>

05:28.348 --> 05:30.431
What do you say, sir?
Ma'am, shoeshine?

05:30.556 --> 05:32.081
I won't look up your skirt.

05:34.652 --> 05:35.876
My gosh...

05:36.044 --> 05:37.885
Crazy! What are you doing?
It's me.

05:38.733 --> 05:40.297
So, Ann, how you been?

05:40.596 --> 05:43.509
Good. Leslie told me
you were working here now.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.595
Just trying the rat race.
Chasing the cheese. Racing the rats.

05:46.763 --> 05:47.930
To get the cheese.

05:48.430 --> 05:50.307
Enough business talk.
You look ravishing.

05:51.035 --> 05:53.395
- Not a lot of customers.
- Business is a little slow.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.198
It is definitely due to...

05:55.963 --> 05:57.063
the economy.

05:58.523 --> 06:02.403
I've been hearing a lot of people
say that a lot, about a lot of stuff.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.782
You want those shoes shined?

06:06.950 --> 06:09.371
I'll give you a discount
because you're a friend of Ann's.

06:10.012 --> 06:12.246
- I'm more than a friend of Ann's.
- Not for long.

06:12.629 --> 06:14.081
- I'm sorry?
- I don't know.

06:14.301 --> 06:16.386
At least, he finally has a real job.

06:16.786 --> 06:18.615
When we were dating,
the only job he had

06:18.740 --> 06:21.588
was sending audition tapes
to <i>Survivor</i> and <i>Deal or no deal</i>.

06:22.104 --> 06:23.633
Hi, my name is Andy Dwyer,

06:23.758 --> 06:26.778
and I would be a perfect contestant
for deal or no deal.

06:29.439 --> 06:31.098
I want it to be a perfect park,

06:31.266 --> 06:32.725
with a state of the art,

06:32.893 --> 06:34.810
swing set and basketball courts.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.167
And off to the side,
a lovely sitting area

06:37.292 --> 06:39.855
for kids with asthma
to watch other kids play.

06:40.782 --> 06:42.948
If I'd had a park like that
when I was growing up,

06:43.073 --> 06:46.530
I probably wouldn't have gone through
such a prolonged mall slut phase.

06:49.018 --> 06:50.318
That's the goal.

06:50.474 --> 06:51.452
Listen,

06:51.620 --> 06:52.994
you got there first.

06:53.119 --> 06:57.018
I'm gonna withdraw my request,
as a professional courtesy to you.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.204
Government gals, right?

07:00.246 --> 07:01.546
Government gals.

07:03.503 --> 07:05.153
So, you talked to Tammy.

07:05.763 --> 07:08.836
What's it like to stare
into the eye of Satan's butt hole?

07:08.961 --> 07:11.180
She's changed.
She's a different person.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.598
It would be healthy

07:12.766 --> 07:15.074
for you to get a sense of closure.
Look at Mark and me.

07:15.199 --> 07:17.311
We slept together, talked about it.
We're friends.

07:18.297 --> 07:19.855
You slept with Brendanawicz?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.894
Tammy and I don't work.

07:24.019 --> 07:25.434
We are oil and water.

07:25.603 --> 07:27.905
Or oil and TNT and C-4

07:28.030 --> 07:30.230
and a detonator and a butane torch.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.242
Nothing good will come.

07:33.808 --> 07:34.808
Wait...

07:39.043 --> 07:40.584
She's here, isn't she?

07:53.105 --> 07:54.556
Good.
Good start.

07:56.578 --> 07:59.283
Sorry about this,
but I really want to talk to you.

07:59.408 --> 08:02.147
Couldn't we go have a cup of coffee?

08:05.023 --> 08:06.610
Let's get this over with.

08:09.614 --> 08:10.656
It means a lot.

08:10.934 --> 08:12.324
You're a miracle worker.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.270
- Do you know what you just did?
- Yes, Donna.

08:17.395 --> 08:19.665
I got two people to put aside
years of hostility

08:19.833 --> 08:21.959
and open a door
to the possibility of friendship.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.209
You were not here
when they got divorced. I was.

08:24.334 --> 08:25.834
Those two are crazy.

08:26.139 --> 08:27.798
And you opened the gates.

08:28.136 --> 08:29.336
To crazy town.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.245
Frankly,
I think Ron was acting like a baby.

08:32.370 --> 08:33.361
A little bit.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.139
What is he afraid of?

08:35.534 --> 08:36.976
Tammy's just a woman.

08:37.101 --> 08:38.251
A nice woman.

08:38.804 --> 08:40.686
You know, she's not a murderer.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.304
She's not a dragon.

08:42.687 --> 08:44.648
It's really good to see you, Ron.

08:45.845 --> 08:47.395
You've aged horribly.

08:48.359 --> 08:49.148
You...

08:49.601 --> 08:51.155
son of a bitch.

08:51.323 --> 08:54.199
- That didn't take long.
- My God! What's your problem?

08:54.660 --> 08:55.993
Nothing's changed.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.661
Who set the bed on fire?

09:00.002 --> 09:01.081
We're fine.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.125
Take it easy.

09:04.664 --> 09:06.815
When you meddle
in someone's personal life,

09:06.940 --> 09:08.189
it's just so...

09:08.624 --> 09:09.636
rewarding.

09:21.906 --> 09:22.686
Gun it!

09:23.327 --> 09:24.605
Usual place?

09:46.043 --> 09:49.026
Good morning, Jerry.
That is a beautiful sweater vest.

09:50.466 --> 09:52.398
You look like you could use $20.

09:52.523 --> 09:54.051
- Am I right?
- Why?

09:54.480 --> 09:56.553
'Cause you're a kid
and kids always need money.

09:56.893 --> 09:58.055
I need money.

09:58.443 --> 10:00.057
That's why you're my favorite.

10:00.225 --> 10:03.772
When Tiger Woods feels invincible,
he wears a red shirt and black pants.

10:03.897 --> 10:05.187
Good morning, deputy.

10:05.587 --> 10:07.564
Ron wears the same thing
after he had sex.

10:07.966 --> 10:09.316
I'm a simple man.

10:09.614 --> 10:12.200
I like pretty dark-haired women
and breakfast food.

10:12.325 --> 10:15.918
But this stock photo,
I bought at a framing store, isn't real.

10:16.066 --> 10:17.574
Today I got the real thing.

10:18.488 --> 10:21.288
A naked Tammy
made me breakfast this morning.

10:22.454 --> 10:24.471
I should've taken a picture of it.

10:26.751 --> 10:27.559
What's up?

10:27.684 --> 10:30.685
My girlfriend's ex is working
100 feet away from my desk.

10:30.810 --> 10:33.178
And he's been pretty clear
out wanting her back.

10:33.446 --> 10:34.974
What do I do with that?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.387
That's a tough one. Break up with her
and tell her to go out with me.

10:38.555 --> 10:42.034
Good. Can I ask you another question?
Why did I come to you for advice?

10:43.697 --> 10:45.894
You should play this one cool, man.
Be the grown-up.

10:46.119 --> 10:47.393
Take the high road.

10:47.979 --> 10:49.329
Ann's a classy chick.

10:49.454 --> 10:52.067
If you get down in the mud,
you're just gonna lose her respect.

10:53.209 --> 10:55.833
You've just made a surprising
amount of sense.

10:57.018 --> 10:58.831
I've never taken the high road.

10:58.956 --> 11:00.339
But I tell other people to.

11:00.464 --> 11:03.321
'Cause then there's more room for me
on the low road.

11:05.719 --> 11:08.119
So how did your coffee
with Tammy go?

11:08.418 --> 11:10.558
Leslie, I can't thank you enough

11:10.741 --> 11:12.671
for sticking your nose
where it didn't belong.

11:12.839 --> 11:13.915
I knew it.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.374
So what did you guys talk about?
Old times?

11:16.499 --> 11:18.231
I love talking about old times.

11:18.356 --> 11:20.429
New times too.
But there's something about old times.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.731
- You know what I mean?
- We didn't talk.

11:22.861 --> 11:23.890
We made love.

11:26.426 --> 11:28.586
Good.
Well, spare me the details.

11:28.711 --> 11:30.431
- I'm just happy...
- It was so intense.

11:30.556 --> 11:33.317
I didn't know where my flesh stopped
and hers began.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.035
You know what I mean?

11:36.209 --> 11:38.248
Our marriage was always
a complete disaster,

11:38.373 --> 11:40.949
but we did have that,

11:41.692 --> 11:42.789
the two of us.

11:42.914 --> 11:45.892
It's like doing peyote
and sneezing slowly

11:46.017 --> 11:47.205
for six hours.

11:47.373 --> 11:51.075
- This seems like a private matter.
- She knows her way around a penis.

11:53.639 --> 11:57.466
Well, I'm happy that it went well
and that you enjoyed your coffee.

11:58.082 --> 12:01.136
I truly believe that everyone
should be friends with their exes.

12:02.211 --> 12:05.612
I can't even tell you how many
of my exes' weddings I've been to.

12:11.744 --> 12:13.809
They're reading
their old divorce papers.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.285
Three fistfuls of hair?

12:16.410 --> 12:17.944
That's not even possible.

12:18.476 --> 12:21.657
Well, I'm too classy
to say I told you so, donna.

12:21.856 --> 12:23.756
So I wrote it on a post it.

12:29.326 --> 12:32.026
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off.

12:33.356 --> 12:36.370
I mean you spend so much time
worrying about this park.

12:36.495 --> 12:38.445
But really, who cares?

12:39.499 --> 12:40.377
I care.

12:40.502 --> 12:41.652
I care a lot.

12:42.124 --> 12:43.428
It's kinda my thing.

12:43.684 --> 12:45.565
But at the end of the day
what does it matter

12:45.690 --> 12:48.884
if the lot becomes a park
or a museum

12:49.086 --> 12:51.164
or a mega church?

12:51.646 --> 12:52.687
Or a library.

12:53.992 --> 12:55.215
Nobody said library.

12:56.237 --> 12:58.568
You've been talking to Tammy
about the lot?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.305
I swear on...

13:02.734 --> 13:03.573
a grave.

13:04.089 --> 13:05.104
Oh, my god!

13:05.655 --> 13:06.827
Tell me the truth.

13:07.025 --> 13:08.412
Are you giving her the lot?

13:09.532 --> 13:10.532
Not giving.

13:11.553 --> 13:13.083
We have discussed a trade.

13:13.534 --> 13:14.534
For what?

13:15.827 --> 13:16.670
Excuse me.

13:17.638 --> 13:18.638
More sex.

13:22.229 --> 13:24.553
Tammy, can I speak with you
for a second?

13:25.423 --> 13:27.736
I know what you're doing.
You don't care about ron.

13:27.861 --> 13:30.090
You're using him to get lot 48
for your library.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.869
Leslie, that's crazy.

13:32.367 --> 13:33.467
And correct.

13:33.850 --> 13:35.063
Why are you doing this?

13:35.430 --> 13:38.056
Les, there are two kinds
of women in this world.

13:38.181 --> 13:40.434
There are women who work hard

13:40.559 --> 13:42.687
and stress out about doing
the right thing

13:42.812 --> 13:44.614
and then there are women
who are cool.

13:45.527 --> 13:47.727
You could either be a Cleopatra

13:47.852 --> 13:50.279
or you could be an
Eleanor Roosevelt.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.585
I'd rather be Cleopatra.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.077
What kind of lunatic would
wanna be Cleopatra

13:55.202 --> 13:56.852
over Eleanor Roosevelt?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.895
Haven't you ever messed
with a man's head

14:00.020 --> 14:02.697
just to see what you could
get him to do for you?

14:02.822 --> 14:05.183
We do it all the time
in the library department.

14:05.308 --> 14:07.053
You should come join us sometime.

14:07.221 --> 14:09.389
I would never work
at the library department.

14:10.182 --> 14:11.408
I'm gonna tell Ron.

14:11.533 --> 14:13.469
And this little game
is gonna be over.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.224
Yeah, you better run.

14:16.728 --> 14:18.273
We're no longer government gals.

14:19.104 --> 14:20.603
Look, we need to talk.

14:22.553 --> 14:24.738
The planning department
reprioritization document?

14:24.906 --> 14:27.240
- Calm down. I haven't signed it yet.
- You're gonna.

14:27.705 --> 14:30.113
Because Tammy wants you to
and you do everything that she wants.

14:30.238 --> 14:32.537
She made some really good points
about libraries.

14:33.051 --> 14:36.059
Are you even listening to yourself?
You're defending the library now?

14:37.061 --> 14:38.010
The library.

14:38.135 --> 14:40.378
Of all the horrifying,
miserable things in the world.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.130
Some people like libraries.

14:42.795 --> 14:45.132
I can't even believe it.
Some people like libraries.

14:45.257 --> 14:46.927
Ron, she's in your head.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.156
You said she was a manipulative monster
and you were right.

14:51.101 --> 14:52.140
Tammy's changed.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.543
Look me in the eye
and tell me that she's changed.

14:56.055 --> 14:57.229
Look me in the eye.

15:00.895 --> 15:02.108
I'm so screwed now.

15:02.561 --> 15:04.398
- Her hooks are in my brain.
- Yep.

15:04.523 --> 15:07.123
She has all the power
and I have nothing.

15:08.248 --> 15:09.449
I'm so little.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.216
Why don't you just break up
with her?

15:23.736 --> 15:25.006
I don't think I can.

15:25.598 --> 15:27.103
We would just end up naked.

15:27.228 --> 15:29.678
And I'd give her your lot
and my house

15:29.910 --> 15:31.338
and God knows what else.

15:31.463 --> 15:33.113
I have no control over my actions.

15:33.238 --> 15:36.177
- Like she's crawled up inside me...
- God, ron.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.645
I don't want to hear about
your disgusting sex anymore.

15:39.079 --> 15:40.479
Okay, now sack up.

15:40.976 --> 15:44.109
You are Ron freakin' Swanson!

15:44.277 --> 15:45.860
Not around her I'm not.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.864
It took years of intense,
focused hatred

15:48.989 --> 15:50.129
to get over her.

15:50.254 --> 15:52.754
And now I've undone
all that great work.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.121
You've gotta help me to break up.

15:56.572 --> 15:58.415
I shouldn't get involved in this.

15:58.737 --> 16:01.322
Now you don't want to get involved?

16:01.600 --> 16:04.504
"It's just coffee, Ron. "
"She's changed, Ron. "

16:04.672 --> 16:06.965
"I let Mark nail me
and we're still friends. "

16:07.191 --> 16:09.083
I never... I would never
use those words.

16:09.208 --> 16:11.108
I never said... Point taken.

16:12.970 --> 16:15.056
Let's go dump your ex.

16:15.401 --> 16:16.401
Thank you.

16:18.090 --> 16:20.024
Would you like to be in the room
when I tell her

16:20.149 --> 16:22.126
- or would you rather wait outside?
- In the room.

16:22.251 --> 16:24.413
I don't want her to think
I'm a wimp.

16:24.924 --> 16:26.915
Here are the ground rules.
Don't talk to her.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.291
Do not make eye contact with her.
Don't believe anything she says.

16:30.416 --> 16:32.275
Just sit there like a potted plant.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.782
Can you do that?

16:34.545 --> 16:35.545
Come on.

16:40.239 --> 16:42.167
So how's the shoeshine game?

16:42.723 --> 16:43.793
I'm on a break.

16:43.918 --> 16:47.293
One of the many advantages
of owning your own business.

16:47.556 --> 16:49.653
You know that's not
your situation, right?

16:52.065 --> 16:53.122
Listen, Donna.

16:53.247 --> 16:54.262
Quick question.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.681
Ann is trying to decide
between Mark and myself.

16:57.097 --> 16:58.350
.- }If you had to choose,

16:58.518 --> 17:00.559
who would you choose?
Right now, on the spot.

17:00.684 --> 17:03.007
I'm not sure.
Why don't you spin around for me.

17:03.132 --> 17:04.814
Can we talk privately?

17:05.258 --> 17:06.961
- Sure.
- Just out here.

17:12.824 --> 17:15.144
So, Tammy, for that
and many other reasons

17:15.269 --> 17:17.868
Ron has decided to end
this relationship.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.215
Wait a minute.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.920
Ron brought you here
to break up with me for him?

17:27.234 --> 17:28.380
She volunteered.

17:31.763 --> 17:33.802
Ron doesn't want to break up
with me.

17:34.611 --> 17:36.235
What Ron wants to do

17:36.957 --> 17:39.281
is leave here right now.

17:40.044 --> 17:42.693
Go to the sleaziest motel in town

17:43.538 --> 17:46.741
and wrap himself around me
like a coiled snake.

17:47.569 --> 17:49.776
- No, he doesn't.
- I'm pretty sure he does.

17:52.737 --> 17:54.948
See? He's completely over you.

17:55.331 --> 17:57.136
Look, I understand

17:57.467 --> 18:00.201
that this Ann situation is awkward.

18:00.326 --> 18:03.194
But I like you a lot as a dude.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.190
And I hope that there is some way

18:05.315 --> 18:08.420
that we can both be mature
and maybe be friends.

18:09.104 --> 18:10.546
Yeah, I doubt it.

18:11.032 --> 18:13.285
I mean, I think
you're a cool dude too.

18:13.410 --> 18:15.009
I like you as well.

18:15.265 --> 18:17.365
But I'm still in love with Ann.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.890
I couldn't have been more upfront
about that.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.330
Is punching allowed
on the high road?

18:25.346 --> 18:26.746
I'm sorry, Leslie.

18:27.823 --> 18:28.823
She wins.

18:30.060 --> 18:31.409
I can't resist her.

18:31.534 --> 18:32.819
But, you have to.

18:32.987 --> 18:35.535
Stay out of this.
This is our relationship.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.742
He's my man and we have
something twisted and beautiful.

18:41.187 --> 18:43.705
You want Ron.
That's what this is all about.

18:43.980 --> 18:45.612
No, that's insane.

18:47.547 --> 18:49.797
Fine, I had one dream, but no, no.

18:49.922 --> 18:52.088
Baby, don't you see
what's happening here?

18:52.256 --> 18:55.499
She's manipulating you
because she's jealous of me

18:55.875 --> 18:58.720
and the things I get to do
to your body and face.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.810
I'm here because Ron is my friend.

19:01.935 --> 19:05.310
And I don't like seeing my friends
miserable. And you make him miserable.

19:05.710 --> 19:08.396
So, Ron, you can give her
the lot or don't. Whatever.

19:09.005 --> 19:10.346
Just please...

19:10.827 --> 19:12.275
find a way to be happy.

19:17.613 --> 19:18.700
No, wait.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.572
Ron, it's okay.
Just sign the thing.

19:21.114 --> 19:24.120
It's not okay. You just put my needs
in front of your own.

19:24.406 --> 19:26.331
No woman has ever done that
for me before.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.813
I'm sure that's not true.

19:27.938 --> 19:29.667
You see the kind of women
that I choose.

19:30.214 --> 19:32.090
Look, just wait for me downstairs.

19:32.215 --> 19:33.465
If I'm not down in 5 min,

19:33.590 --> 19:36.406
it's only because I'm receiving
a pleasure so intense...

19:41.159 --> 19:42.889
What the hell are you doing?

19:43.164 --> 19:45.391
Andy and Ann's family shoeshine?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.185
I thought it had a nice ring to it.

19:47.638 --> 19:51.272
Mark has been really cool about this.
And you're throwing it in his face.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.296
But I still have feelings for you.

19:53.786 --> 19:55.737
I said it.
What do you want me to do?

19:55.862 --> 19:58.029
Not mention those feelings
to your boyfriend?

19:59.490 --> 20:01.307
And you might wanna take
these pictures down.

20:01.432 --> 20:02.432
Oh, my God.

20:02.557 --> 20:05.380
- Take those pictures down.
- What? It's fine. What did I...

20:05.505 --> 20:06.935
- All of it!
- I'm gonna.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.060
Now!

20:09.756 --> 20:11.876
- Give me the bikini one.
- The teeny one?

20:12.001 --> 20:13.128
Bikini one.

20:21.996 --> 20:24.078
- You didn't give her.
- Let's get out of here.

20:24.203 --> 20:26.266
- Is part of your moustache missing?
- Yes.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.268
- Walk.
- There's a push pin in your face.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.583
Leave it in.
Can't you walk faster?

20:30.708 --> 20:32.808
My legs are shorter than yours.

20:38.427 --> 20:39.827
We had a good run.

20:43.946 --> 20:46.307
Thank you for saving my future park.

20:46.540 --> 20:48.204
It must have been hard for you.

20:48.908 --> 20:50.949
You didn't kill Tammy, did you?

20:51.197 --> 20:53.603
I'm afraid she can't be killed.

20:55.513 --> 20:56.504
To exes...

20:57.167 --> 20:59.299
may they always stay that way.

21:00.174 --> 21:01.224
Tammy is...

21:02.881 --> 21:04.179
a mean person.

21:04.716 --> 21:06.681
Come on,
you can do better than that.

21:07.648 --> 21:10.144
- She's a great A bitch.
- There we go.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.479
Every time she laughs,
an angel dies.

21:13.791 --> 21:15.690
Even telemarketers avoid her.

21:16.017 --> 21:19.220
Her birth was payback
for the sins of men.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.821
But, you know,
the worst thing about her,

21:22.132 --> 21:23.781
She works for the library.

21:24.162 --> 21:26.087
She works for the library.
