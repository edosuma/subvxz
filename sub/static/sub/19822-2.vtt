WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:06.672
(all talking at once)

00:06.741 --> 00:10.342
(indistinct crosstalk continues)

00:14.348 --> 00:16.648
How can you all just feed your faces?

00:16.717 --> 00:18.951
(laughing and crosstalk)

00:19.020 --> 00:21.787
What are we going to do about this?

00:21.856 --> 00:24.623
Kate and Erik are gone
and we're all alone!?

00:27.495 --> 00:30.095
Hey, we're not alone. You
know, we've got each other.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.430
Yeah, and they're, they're
not gone, they're just...

00:32.500 --> 00:33.966
You know, not here right now.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.702
Keep it together, Sal, you're
supposed to be the smart one.

00:36.771 --> 00:37.870
We need you to come up with a plan.

00:37.938 --> 00:40.606
Me? I don't know what
to do, I'm just a kid.

00:40.674 --> 00:42.708
Sal's right. I'm the oldest.

00:42.777 --> 00:46.545
I'm in charge. And I say, uh...

00:47.882 --> 00:50.215
I need to clear my head.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.388
So, what are we supposed to do?

00:56.457 --> 00:58.891
Why aren't we calling the police?

00:58.959 --> 01:00.125
'Cause they'll split us up.

01:00.194 --> 01:03.762
I know you'll use any excuse
to get "Officer Adorable"

01:03.831 --> 01:05.531
to come over, but we
can't take the risk.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.167
Besides, I don't wanna have to
wipe your drool off the floor.

01:08.235 --> 01:10.502
I don't drool.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.439
No, hey, we drop everything and
keep looking until we find 'em.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.107
You mean...

01:15.176 --> 01:16.608
No school!

01:16.677 --> 01:18.844
I'll call and tell 'em you're sick.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.045
(Max) What about you?

01:20.114 --> 01:21.513
I don't go to school.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.749
"De Money" is taking a gap year.

01:23.818 --> 01:25.017
"De Money?"

01:25.086 --> 01:28.754
That's my new nickname
instead of "Canned Ham."

01:28.823 --> 01:31.290
Sorry, Canned Ham, you
know the nickname rules.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.525
I don't know if we should
<i>all</i> take a sick day.

01:33.594 --> 01:34.860
They might get suspicious.

01:34.929 --> 01:37.129
Let me guess, you volunteer
to go to school.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.598
Well, if you really think
somebody needs to,

01:39.667 --> 01:41.500
I guess I could take one for the team.

01:43.571 --> 01:47.106
What? I like school. Is that so weird?

01:47.174 --> 01:49.141
Max, you should go to school, too.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.343
Excuse me?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.544
Think about it. That Tim guy's

01:52.613 --> 01:53.712
probably gonna check and make sure

01:53.781 --> 01:56.215
you show up for the first
day at your new school.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.951
Good point.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.621
(Daniel) Hi, uh, it's Erik Hunter.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.591
It looks like the girls have
come down with something.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.259
I think it's the flu.

02:08.329 --> 02:10.162
I'm gonna keep them home for the day.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.264
The boys will be in.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.600
Our new one, Maximilian,

02:14.668 --> 02:17.736
is really psyched for his first day.

02:17.805 --> 02:20.539
Maximilian is really smart

02:20.608 --> 02:23.909
and I want to make sure
he's challenged in school.

02:23.978 --> 02:28.113
I would recommend you put him
in all the hardest classes.

02:29.183 --> 02:30.482
Don't worry about the workload.

02:30.551 --> 02:31.950
He can handle it.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.619
Thanks for much, have
a great day, bye-bye.

02:34.788 --> 02:37.689
That's for calling me Canned Ham.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.291
Okay, fair enough.

02:39.360 --> 02:40.392
Come on, we're gonna be late.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.833
(school bell ringing)

02:47.902 --> 02:49.434
Let's go.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.204
Hurry up, we're late.

02:54.000 --> 03:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.552 --> 03:07.953
(doorbell chimes)

03:09.657 --> 03:12.324
Why aren't you open? It's 9:00 sharp.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.725
Excuse me?

03:13.794 --> 03:15.561
This is the Hunter Museum, right?

03:15.629 --> 03:18.830
Yes, this is the Hunter Museum, but...

03:18.899 --> 03:21.600
But nothing, uh, step
aside and let us in.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.402
We're here for the tour.

03:23.470 --> 03:26.738
Uh, I'm so sorry, sir,
um, we're closed today.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.373
The guide is sick.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.142
We came all the way
from the north country.

03:30.211 --> 03:32.244
Well, in that case...

03:32.313 --> 03:35.714
Make sure they don't steal
our bikes on the way out.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.021
Which way's the principal's office?

03:43.090 --> 03:44.756
I have to undo that
stuff Daniel pulled.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.025
There's no way I'm getting
stuck in the hardest classes.

03:47.094 --> 03:49.528
Don't worry about it. He
was just messing with you.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.997
There's only one class for our grade.

03:52.066 --> 03:53.532
Our grade?

03:53.601 --> 03:55.767
Aren't you, like, a
year younger than me?

03:55.836 --> 03:58.971
I sort of skipped a grade.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.677
Nice of you to join us, Sal.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.146
I take it this is Maximilian?

04:08.215 --> 04:11.350
Live and in person. You
can call me Max though.

04:11.418 --> 04:14.519
What can I call you? This is Mr.
Kittredge.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.089
20 minutes late on your first day.

04:17.156 --> 04:18.923
Well, you certainly know
how to make an entrance.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.660
Yeah, I, uh, overslept.
I was dreaming about

04:21.728 --> 04:23.295
a soccer game and it
went into overtime so...

04:23.364 --> 04:24.963
(class laughs)

04:25.032 --> 04:27.266
And isn't it lovely that Salvatore

04:27.334 --> 04:28.800
has decided to join us too.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.669
Please, have a seat.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.104
(Sal) You're getting us into trouble.

04:36.143 --> 04:39.111
(panting) Whew.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.214
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
Sorry for the delay.

04:42.283 --> 04:44.149
The Hunter Museum is now open.

04:44.218 --> 04:46.852
That unpleasant young man
said the guide was sick.

04:46.920 --> 04:50.889
Oh, he is but there's a
new guide filling in, me.

04:50.958 --> 04:55.093
You? Why not? I am a Hunter after all.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.337
Please, do come on.

05:14.048 --> 05:16.048
Welcome, so, before we start the tour,

05:16.116 --> 05:17.816
everybody, please gather around.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.918
Okay.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.787
Say, "Hunter."

05:21.855 --> 05:23.155
Hunter! Hunter!

05:23.223 --> 05:24.156
(shutter clicks)

05:25.392 --> 05:28.660
(Mr. Kittredge) Okay,
open up page seven.

05:28.729 --> 05:32.097
Now who can tell us something
about the Pleistocene epoch?

05:34.201 --> 05:35.600
Anyone?

05:37.237 --> 05:39.104
Anyone at all?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.708
Sal?

05:42.776 --> 05:45.210
Pleistocene is the first
epoch of Quaternary Period.

05:45.279 --> 05:46.478
It was characterized by the appearance

05:46.547 --> 05:48.146
of large land mammals and birds

05:48.215 --> 05:50.282
including Mastodons, Mammoths, giant...

05:50.351 --> 05:52.584
Thank you, Sal.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.219
What else?

05:54.288 --> 05:56.521
Put your hand down, Sal.

05:58.692 --> 06:00.859
Max, yes, what can you share with us?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.227
Can I go to the bathroom?

06:02.296 --> 06:08.233
Fine. Sal? Why don't
you show him the way?

06:08.302 --> 06:09.534
Do I have to?

06:09.603 --> 06:10.702
Yes. But...

06:10.771 --> 06:13.171
Go. Later-ade.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.510
I thought you had to
go to the bathroom.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.345
Try to keep up.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.347
That was just to get out
of that boring class.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.950
'Cause you wanted to go to the library?

06:25.018 --> 06:27.352
To research this Saganash business.

06:27.421 --> 06:30.122
You're a computer whiz, right?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.957
Get to it.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.927
Watch the door.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.930
If Kluterbeek catches us
in here, we're toast.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.432
What's a "Clutter Beak"?

06:40.501 --> 06:43.702
The headmistress. She is a pit bull.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.303
I'm not afraid of
anyone with that name.

06:45.372 --> 06:46.872
You should be.

06:46.940 --> 06:49.107
She's suspended kids
for less than this.

06:49.176 --> 06:51.410
Suspended on my first morning.

06:51.478 --> 06:52.811
That'd be a record.

06:56.383 --> 06:57.949
What makes me think you're
not typing "Saganash"

06:58.018 --> 06:59.151
into the search engine?

06:59.219 --> 07:00.919
Commercial search engines
are for amateurs.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.255
Dynamic assignment
distributed web crawling

07:03.323 --> 07:06.458
uses infinite client sourcing
to maximize efficiency.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.994
Okay, say that again and
imagine I'm not a tech genius?

07:09.062 --> 07:10.028
My way's better.

07:11.365 --> 07:12.798
Okay, I'm in.

07:15.636 --> 07:19.304
All I'm getting for Saganash
is a hotel in Miami.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.106
And a deodorant.

07:21.175 --> 07:22.307
Maybe we're looking
for the wrong thing.

07:22.376 --> 07:24.609
You know, what if it's
some kind of code?

07:24.678 --> 07:28.547
Ooh, try, um... Hsanagas.

07:28.615 --> 07:30.215
Saganash spelled backwards?

07:30.284 --> 07:32.350
Really? Think about it.

07:32.419 --> 07:34.820
Kate wrote "Saganash," so
it must mean something.

07:34.888 --> 07:37.756
But how can it mean anything
if it's not on any computer?

07:37.825 --> 07:39.157
Just because something doesn't
show up on a computer

07:39.226 --> 07:40.826
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.027
Don't be ridiculous.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.196
The Internet is the
repository of all knowledge.

07:44.264 --> 07:45.697
Oh, yeah?

07:45.766 --> 07:47.732
Have it tell me what
I had for breakfast.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.167
What? It doesn't know that.

07:49.236 --> 07:50.469
It only knows the information

07:50.537 --> 07:52.637
that has been entered
<i>into</i> the computer.

07:52.706 --> 07:53.872
Which at this point is just about

07:53.941 --> 07:54.873
everything in the world.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.542
Just about, but not everything.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.711
Where can we find information
that Erik and Kate would know

07:59.780 --> 08:01.880
that isn't in a computer?

08:02.883 --> 08:03.815
(both) The library at home.

08:03.884 --> 08:04.883
We gotta go.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.185
But how? It's only first period.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.589
(sneezes)

08:11.825 --> 08:13.592
He doesn't look sick to me.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.060
Are you kidding?

08:15.128 --> 08:17.596
He's got all the symptoms
of a serious illness.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.865
Right? Headache? Ooh!

08:19.933 --> 08:22.000
Tenderness in the belly. (grunts)

08:22.069 --> 08:23.802
Muscle weakness and loss of balance.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.003
(grunts)

08:25.072 --> 08:26.071
(thuds to floor)

08:27.641 --> 08:29.908
I know your sisters
are home sick today.

08:29.977 --> 08:33.778
I suppose it's possible he's
caught what they've got.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.212
That's what I'm saying, yeah.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.950
All right, Sal, you're
excused for the day.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.818
(sneezes)

08:40.888 --> 08:42.587
What about me?

08:42.655 --> 08:43.922
Well, you like fine.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.590
For now, but I've been infected.

08:45.659 --> 08:47.659
This thing is mad
contagious, okay, I...

08:47.728 --> 08:48.760
(coughs)

08:48.829 --> 08:49.761
(sneezes)

08:49.830 --> 08:52.297
I would hate to get anyone else sick.

08:52.366 --> 08:55.867
Don't get your germs all over me!

08:55.936 --> 08:58.169
Go home, both of you!

09:10.217 --> 09:11.917
This is a painting of a game board

09:11.985 --> 09:14.219
for the kind of tic-tac-toe
people used to play.

09:14.288 --> 09:16.588
And the game really
never became popular.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.123
And all that's left of it
today is this picture.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.158
You're making all of this up.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.160
I am not. Yes, you are.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.695
This is not a game.

09:23.764 --> 09:27.198
This is an abstract work
in the style of Mondrian.

09:28.635 --> 09:30.201
It is a game. I've played it

09:30.270 --> 09:32.470
a lot of times with my
brothers and sister.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.372
And you wouldn't know
because you're too mean.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.874
Nobody will play with you.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.610
This way, everybody.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.682
Since when do you know
how to do laundry?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.450
Do I look like an idiot?

09:45.519 --> 09:47.586
You put the clothes in, add soap.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.255
The machines does the rest.

09:50.324 --> 09:51.756
This is pointless. I can't find

09:51.825 --> 09:53.658
anything useful about Saganash.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.493
Isn't there a Saganash deodorant?

09:55.562 --> 09:58.663
Read my lips, useful.

09:58.732 --> 10:00.665
There's just a hotel.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.701
And yes, I know, a deodorant.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.102
There's our answer, that must be it.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.937
Are you kidding me?
That's in Florida. So?

10:06.006 --> 10:07.505
So, you think they would just
leave the country without

10:07.574 --> 10:10.041
telling us on the one day a new
kid comes to live with us?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.544
I'll bet Erik surprised Kate

10:12.613 --> 10:14.512
with a trip for their anniversary.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.281
He probably didn't tell us because

10:16.350 --> 10:18.950
he was afraid we'd spoil the surprise.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.819
They wouldn't just leave us all alone.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.622
Hey, I'm 17, practically an adult.

10:23.690 --> 10:26.191
They know they can trust me
to take care of you guys,

10:26.259 --> 10:29.127
especially since I'm taking a gap year.

10:32.933 --> 10:35.800
Is that detergent or dish soap?

10:35.869 --> 10:38.837
Soap and detergent are the same thing.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.539
If you don't believe me, look it up.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.516
(beeping)

10:51.585 --> 10:52.717
Need any help in there?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.654
Aah! Aah!

10:57.224 --> 10:58.256
(groaning)

10:58.325 --> 10:59.424
Definitely don't look like an idiot.

10:59.493 --> 11:00.825
(doorbell chimes)

11:04.564 --> 11:05.930
Daniel?

11:05.999 --> 11:09.067
Simone! What's up?

11:09.136 --> 11:10.468
Is everything all right?

11:10.537 --> 11:15.106
Uh, yeah, yeah, um...
I, uh, was just, uh...

11:15.175 --> 11:17.642
Washing my hair. (chuckling)

11:19.246 --> 11:22.280
To what do I owe this
unexpected pleasure?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.883
I was just wondering if
Erik and Kate were home.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.685
Um...

11:33.393 --> 11:36.394
I was just wondering if
Erik and Kate were home.

11:36.463 --> 11:39.397
Um...

11:44.971 --> 11:48.707
You're very strong, aren't you?

11:48.775 --> 11:51.142
I don't like to brag.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.912
But yes... I am.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.648
Erik and Kate? Are they home?

11:56.717 --> 11:58.550
Oh, uh...

11:58.618 --> 12:00.885
They... they went on an art
exhibition outside the city.

12:00.954 --> 12:03.321
We'll have them call you
when they get back, okay?

12:03.390 --> 12:04.856
Shouldn't you guys be in school?

12:04.925 --> 12:06.124
Gap year.

12:06.193 --> 12:08.893
And, um... (coughing) I'm
sick and so is Anika.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.395
We caught that bug that's going around.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.397
(coughing) Daniel's taking care of us,

12:12.466 --> 12:14.165
and you should probably
go before you catch it.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.434
(coughing) Ooh, um, or, uh,

12:16.503 --> 12:19.738
maybe you'd like to come
in for a cup of tea.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.306
(Tess) I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:21.374 --> 12:22.340
Sure it is.

12:22.409 --> 12:23.575
You're not contagious anymore.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.276
Come in. (coughs)

12:25.345 --> 12:27.912
Um, Tess, will you make us some tea?

12:27.981 --> 12:29.914
I'll be right back.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.217
(chuckling)

12:33.520 --> 12:35.920
So, tell me, do Erik and Kate

12:35.989 --> 12:37.522
leave you guys home alone very often?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.424
Sure.

12:39.493 --> 12:42.494
I mean, no, I mean, we're not alone.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.429
It's only for a little while.

12:45.766 --> 12:49.334
Sorry to keep you waiting.

12:49.402 --> 12:53.538
Tess, could you pour
some tea for me too?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.373
Sure, no problem.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.610
I hitting the gym later.

12:58.678 --> 13:01.479
I'm up to 50 one-arm pushups.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.847
Do you work out?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.582
I... You really should.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.622
So, what are you guys talking about?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.590
I was just asking Tess
about your parents

13:12.659 --> 13:14.058
leaving you guys alone.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.827
It's no big deal.

13:15.896 --> 13:20.799
I'm here and I'm not
exactly a kid anymore.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.636
(door opens)

13:24.704 --> 13:25.837
I'll get that.

13:37.684 --> 13:40.819
So, uh, do you have any hobbies?

13:40.887 --> 13:44.055
Did Kate and Erik come back? Oh.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.423
What are you doing home?

13:45.492 --> 13:46.591
Researching Saganash.

13:46.660 --> 13:47.892
That's what I'm supposed to be doing.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.127
How's that working out?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.329
Not well, there's nothing
on the Internet.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.398
Exactly. We're gonna
look in the library.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.934
Did you know there are things out there

13:56.002 --> 13:57.769
that aren't on the Internet?

13:57.838 --> 14:00.038
How crazy is that?

14:00.106 --> 14:01.606
You can come with us if you want.

14:01.675 --> 14:02.841
You know, help us look
through all those books.

14:02.909 --> 14:05.210
Really? I have your permission? Thanks.

14:05.278 --> 14:06.511
Oh, no, I didn't mean, like...

14:06.580 --> 14:08.580
You know, hey, do whatever
you want, I don't care.

14:08.648 --> 14:10.448
I'm coming. Great.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.883
No, I'm not. That works for me too.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.484
I can't leave Daniel alone with Simone.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.753
(whispering) Simone is here?

14:15.822 --> 14:16.988
Who's Simone?

14:17.057 --> 14:19.090
It's this cop that Daniel
has a huge crush on

14:19.159 --> 14:20.458
and who knows what he'll tell her?

14:20.527 --> 14:24.295
Okay, so get rid of Simone and
then come to the library.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.730
Or don't, you know, whatever.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.066
(Anika) This painting is based
on my favorite cartoon,

14:28.134 --> 14:29.334
"Pudgie and Budgie."

14:29.402 --> 14:32.003
Hey, guys, say hi to my tour group.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.305
You're leading a tour all by yourself?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.107
Mm-hmm, they're from up north.

14:36.176 --> 14:37.775
Be sure to count the
silver before they leave.

14:37.844 --> 14:39.277
Especially the knives.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.448
Come on!

14:46.786 --> 14:53.358
I was thinking I've got nothing
planned for this Saturday so...

14:53.426 --> 14:55.293
maybe...

14:55.362 --> 14:56.461
(coughing)

14:56.529 --> 14:57.996
Can you give me some cough medicine?

14:58.064 --> 14:59.330
(coughing)

14:59.399 --> 15:00.732
I gotta go.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.935
I'll walk you out. (coughs)

15:04.004 --> 15:06.571
(clears throat, coughs)

15:13.680 --> 15:14.646
Whoa.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.414
There are a lot of books in here.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.417
That is why they call
it a library, you know?

15:19.486 --> 15:22.487
I know, there's just... so many.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.488
How are we gonna check 'em all?

15:23.556 --> 15:25.423
One at a time.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.658
Where do we start?

15:26.726 --> 15:28.326
I'll start with the "A"s,
you start with the "Z"s

15:28.395 --> 15:29.994
and we'll work our way
towards the middle.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.329
What about me?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.730
I'm sure we have some
comic books somewhere.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.565
Oh, ha, ha.

15:34.634 --> 15:36.034
I'll take the middle of the alphabet.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.569
"M" s, here I come.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.474
So, every night, this tiny bird

15:43.543 --> 15:46.544
would tell the boy all sorts
of funny bedtime stories.

15:46.613 --> 15:53.418
And the boy whose name was...
Posh Harry in the red sweater

15:53.486 --> 15:55.853
would always keep the
bird very close to him.

15:55.922 --> 15:59.090
Uh, even at school. He hid
him in a small drawer.

15:59.159 --> 16:02.794
And at lunchtime, he fed
him pieces of banana.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.663
Oh, come on, we didn't come all the way

16:05.732 --> 16:08.499
to hear a bunch of made up poppycock.

16:08.568 --> 16:12.036
And why aren't you in
school today anyway?

16:13.673 --> 16:15.540
I'll be right back.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.843
Anything, anybody?

16:18.912 --> 16:21.446
I saw sapsuckers four books ago.

16:21.514 --> 16:22.613
That was pretty close.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.582
I breathed a bunch of
dust from the 1800s.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.417
(coughs)

16:26.486 --> 16:30.355
I need help. The north
people hate my tour. Why?

16:30.423 --> 16:34.625
I maybe told them stories
that were kind of slightly

16:34.694 --> 16:36.361
totally made up.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.528
Heh, nice.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.163
They're really mad.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.299
Sal, you know everything
about the museum.

16:41.368 --> 16:42.467
Can you go talk to them?

16:42.535 --> 16:44.335
I can't leave now, we're
in the middle of this.

16:44.404 --> 16:45.570
(exhales)

16:45.638 --> 16:46.838
Here.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.576
"Sal's Professional Hunter
Museum Audio Tour."

16:51.644 --> 16:53.244
Thanks, Sal.

16:53.313 --> 16:54.912
(sighs)

16:54.981 --> 16:56.381
I need a break.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.082
How do you take a break
from doing nothing?

16:58.151 --> 17:00.018
This is useless. It's gonna take years

17:00.086 --> 17:01.686
to go through all these stupid books.

17:01.755 --> 17:03.721
Whoa, easy on the antiques.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.457
(creaks open)

17:08.795 --> 17:11.095
Uh, you guys?

17:14.800 --> 17:16.467
(creaking)

17:19.372 --> 17:20.471
(sighs)

17:28.815 --> 17:30.748
(Tess) A secret library?

17:30.817 --> 17:33.017
This is awesome!

17:34.788 --> 17:37.622
(Max) More books... yay.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.691
(water dripping)

17:48.968 --> 17:50.234
What's up there?

17:50.303 --> 17:52.837
I'm not sure. But it's
the perfect habitat

17:52.906 --> 17:54.739
for my favorite animal species.

17:54.808 --> 17:56.340
Myotis emarginatus.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.610
For a minute, I thought
you were gonna say bats.

17:59.679 --> 18:03.514
Myotis are bats.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.851
This is a painting of a Dutch meadow

18:06.920 --> 18:10.621
painted in 1645 by Paulus Potter,

18:10.690 --> 18:14.459
born in 1625 in Enkhuizen.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.360
At last, some facts.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.029
This way, please. Excuse me,

18:18.098 --> 18:20.698
don't you have some silly
story about that tree?

18:20.767 --> 18:23.835
Or maybe that funny
looking cow back there?

18:23.903 --> 18:25.036
As a matter of fact, I...

18:25.105 --> 18:27.205
No, just stick to the facts.

18:29.976 --> 18:33.444
Oh, all right, all right, all right.

18:35.381 --> 18:36.481
Well...

18:38.785 --> 18:40.551
These aren't just any books.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.186
This is the history
of the Hunter family

18:42.255 --> 18:44.155
going all the way back to the 1300s.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.190
Whoopee.

18:49.329 --> 18:50.428
Check it out.

18:51.931 --> 18:53.097
It's a ship's log.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.768
It's a voyage to Indonesia
over 300 years ago.

18:57.837 --> 19:01.038
Erik's great-great-great-
great-great-great...

19:01.107 --> 19:02.874
How many greats is that? Six.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.109
Great-great grandfather
was the captain.

19:07.380 --> 19:10.481
That's pretty cool, I guess.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.453
These books are about more
than just the Hunters.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.990
This is the end of the line.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.159
I hope you all enjoyed your
visit to the Hunter Museum.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.761
Please don't forget to
give us a review online

19:23.830 --> 19:26.631
unless you didn't like it. Then
please don't say anything.

19:26.699 --> 19:30.568
It was wonderful. Thank you.

19:31.704 --> 19:32.637
Thank you.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.477
I'm not gonna give you one penny.

19:39.546 --> 19:44.682
Maybe you'd like to walk
back to north country.

19:44.751 --> 19:46.150
Fine.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.786
Thank you.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.599
Look what I got.

20:01.668 --> 20:03.801
Wow, what'd you do, rob a bank?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.537
Unh-unh, I gave a tour in the museum.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.838
All by yourself?

20:07.907 --> 20:09.840
Mm-hmm. Look, I got ten...

20:09.909 --> 20:11.108
We found Saganash.

20:11.177 --> 20:13.811
Well, what is it? Don't
leave us hanging.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.379
It's a what, it's a who.

20:15.448 --> 20:16.847
Saganash is the name of
an old merchant family

20:16.916 --> 20:18.049
just like the Hunters.

20:18.117 --> 20:19.817
They used to do a lot
of business together.

20:21.120 --> 20:25.356
Hey... it's the same guys.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.424
When was this?

20:26.492 --> 20:28.526
1647.

20:28.595 --> 20:30.628
Wow, that's, uh...

20:35.001 --> 20:37.401
That's a really long time ago.

20:37.470 --> 20:38.703
So, what does it mean?

20:38.771 --> 20:41.272
How will it help us find Kate and Erik?

20:41.341 --> 20:44.108
I don't know.

20:44.177 --> 20:45.977
At least it's a start.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.246
It's definitely a start.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.257
(cell phone ringtone)

20:59.325 --> 21:01.559
Child Services, Tim speaking.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.894
Hi, is this Child Services?

21:03.963 --> 21:07.598
Sorry, yeah, uh, Child Services,

21:07.667 --> 21:08.799
how can I help you?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.067
Hi, this is Simone Smith.

21:10.136 --> 21:13.070
I'm a police officer in
Amsterdam District 17.

21:13.139 --> 21:15.339
<i>You know the Hunters, right?</i>

21:15.408 --> 21:16.907
What did he do?

21:16.976 --> 21:18.542
Who?

21:18.611 --> 21:21.012
Max, that's why you're calling, right?

21:21.080 --> 21:22.747
Please tell me he didn't fill the house

21:22.815 --> 21:23.848
with wild dogs again.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.816
<i>No, it's nothing like that.</i>

21:25.885 --> 21:27.852
Then... what?

21:27.920 --> 21:30.521
I was over there earlier and...

21:30.590 --> 21:32.790
I don't think there's any supervision.

21:32.859 --> 21:36.193
<i>I don't think there
are any adults there.</i>

21:38.831 --> 21:42.633
Is it possible for you to
come over and check it out?
