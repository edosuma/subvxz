WEBVTT

00:03.434 --> 00:06.565
REALTOR:
Look, I can't list this dump
unless you guys exterminate.

00:06.608 --> 00:07.739
You know, I think
my wife and I

00:07.782 --> 00:10.086
made an offer
on this place once.

00:10.130 --> 00:12.043
We didn't get it.

00:12.086 --> 00:14.608
Well, good news is, I'll bet
you can afford it now, huh?

00:14.652 --> 00:16.869
[chuckling]:
Yeah, I'm sure.

00:16.913 --> 00:19.000
Whew! Wow, looks to me
like you got yourself

00:19.043 --> 00:21.826
a full-on stage three
larval infestation.

00:21.869 --> 00:23.478
All right.

00:23.521 --> 00:26.434
Let's, uh...
Let's take a look, here.

00:26.478 --> 00:28.173
It's kinda gross, huh?

00:28.217 --> 00:29.565
Little bit.

00:30.695 --> 00:32.086
[beeping][chuckling]

00:33.739 --> 00:36.043
Yeah, you got enough
malaria-carriers here

00:36.086 --> 00:38.217
[Spanish accent]:
to make mosquito mojitos
until May Day!

00:38.260 --> 00:42.043
But y-you can
pump it out, right?

00:42.086 --> 00:44.130
Remove the red tag?

00:44.173 --> 00:46.304
Let's drain it.
Go from there.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.304
Okay?
Makes sense.
Yeah.

00:48.347 --> 00:50.521
[grunting][pump whirring]

00:53.739 --> 00:54.869
Oh, jeez!
Oh my God!

00:54.913 --> 00:55.956
What? What?

00:56.000 --> 00:57.086
Wh-Wh-What is it?

00:57.130 --> 00:58.086
I'm just-- I'm just--

00:58.130 --> 00:59.347
[chuckling]

00:59.391 --> 01:00.391
I'm just messing
with you.

01:00.434 --> 01:02.043
You gotta lighten
up, man, really.

01:02.086 --> 01:02.695
Nice. Nice.

01:06.869 --> 01:08.782
Oh, my-- oh, my God,
is that...?

01:08.826 --> 01:10.826
Oh, no.

01:10.869 --> 01:13.086
Oh!

01:43.391 --> 01:44.826
[typing]

01:47.217 --> 01:47.956
ZIVA:
I actually think it's--

01:49.347 --> 01:50.304
What are you doing?

01:50.347 --> 01:51.826
Uh, nothing, I was, uh--

01:51.869 --> 01:53.173
Lost a contact.

01:53.217 --> 01:54.652
Uh, where?
On Ziva's keyboard?

01:54.695 --> 01:56.000
You do not wear glasses.

01:56.043 --> 01:57.608
Maybe I started.

01:57.652 --> 01:58.826
Maybe you're lying.

01:58.869 --> 02:00.391
Maybe you should butt out,
McThird-Wheel.

02:00.434 --> 02:02.652
What were you
looking for, Tony?

02:02.695 --> 02:03.695
I'm sorry,
that's classified.

02:03.739 --> 02:06.434
You were trying to
access my email.

02:06.478 --> 02:08.739
How do you
know that?

02:08.782 --> 02:10.826
ZIVA:
Because McGee installed
a security system

02:10.869 --> 02:13.478
on my desktop.
Very hi-tech, by the way.

02:13.521 --> 02:14.217
You got caught red-handed.

02:14.260 --> 02:15.478
I got what?

02:15.521 --> 02:18.173
ZIVA:
There! Guilty as charged.

02:18.217 --> 02:21.043
So, what were you
looking for, Tony?

02:21.086 --> 02:24.652
Well, ever since you got back
from South Beach, you've been...

02:24.695 --> 02:26.217
flirting with the Miami Heat.

02:26.260 --> 02:27.217
He's just a friend.

02:28.869 --> 02:30.173
You are jealous.

02:30.217 --> 02:33.260
No. But I am concerned
about our national security.

02:33.304 --> 02:36.391
He's got a very
impressive clearance level.

02:36.434 --> 02:37.956
Now you're trying to
make me feel inadequate.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.478
Ha!

02:39.521 --> 02:41.043
No, that's my job,
DiNozzo.

02:41.086 --> 02:42.565
GIBBS:
A dead petty officer,
grab your gear.

02:43.826 --> 02:44.739
I'm going to ride with Gibbs.

02:46.347 --> 02:47.608
Now who's the third wheel?

02:47.652 --> 02:48.652
Shotgun, McGee!

02:48.695 --> 02:50.130
No... ow!

02:50.173 --> 02:51.652
[camera snapping]

02:51.695 --> 02:54.478
TONY:
This tub needs a new filter.

02:54.521 --> 02:56.739
Not exactly Davy
Jones' locker.

02:56.782 --> 02:59.217
But he did meet
a watery grave,

02:59.260 --> 03:01.391
even if it was only
18 inches deep at the time.

03:01.434 --> 03:03.739
Here we go.

03:05.000 --> 03:05.956
McGEE:
So Ducky...

03:06.000 --> 03:07.565
all right...

03:07.608 --> 03:09.260
our deceased is

03:09.304 --> 03:11.869
Petty Officer First Class
Edward Bick.

03:11.913 --> 03:14.043
Stationed at Norfolk, assigned
to the USS Lockwood.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.869
Fish him out.

03:15.913 --> 03:20.391
Uh, boss, this really
is a HazMat situation.

03:20.434 --> 03:23.260
You know, they did red-tag this
hot tub for mosquito larva.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.130
I think we really should call...

03:25.173 --> 03:26.086
Get in the hot tub, Tim.

03:29.521 --> 03:31.304
I bet you're not used
to hearing that, huh?

03:31.347 --> 03:33.913
"Get in the hot tub, Tim."

03:33.956 --> 03:37.304
Actually, I used to study
in a Jacuzzi, in college.

03:37.347 --> 03:39.652
McGEE:
We had one up
on the roof of the dorm.

03:39.695 --> 03:43.000
And you would study
in the Jacuzzi.

03:43.043 --> 03:43.652
Of course you would.

03:49.391 --> 03:51.043
Ooh.

03:51.086 --> 03:53.826
Ah-- Archimedes' theory, boss.

03:53.869 --> 03:55.913
My foot mass is going to
displace enough liquid

03:55.956 --> 03:58.217
to breach over
the top of the boots.

03:58.260 --> 04:00.217
It's more than a theory, it's a
proven scientific fact, McGee.

04:01.739 --> 04:02.739
Swim, Tim.

04:05.260 --> 04:06.000
[horrified
exclamation]

04:06.043 --> 04:07.565
Okay...

04:07.608 --> 04:09.043
[disgusted laughter]

04:09.086 --> 04:11.347
TONY: This reminds me of
the I Love Lucy

04:11.391 --> 04:12.347
grape-squishing episode.

04:12.391 --> 04:14.391
I love that episode.

04:14.434 --> 04:16.000
JIMMY:
Lucy gets dressed up
like a gypsy,

04:16.043 --> 04:17.869
and then she jumps
into the vat of grapes,

04:17.913 --> 04:19.826
so Ricky won't find out.

04:21.434 --> 04:22.347
It's inappropriate.
Sorry.

04:22.391 --> 04:23.782
Crime scene.

04:23.826 --> 04:25.695
[grunting]

04:27.173 --> 04:28.782
[camera snapping]

04:28.826 --> 04:29.869
Got a time of death?

04:29.913 --> 04:31.478
Ah, the body's been in the water

04:31.521 --> 04:32.869
too long to determine that.

04:32.913 --> 04:34.826
GIBBS:
You got a causeof death, Duck?

04:34.869 --> 04:36.086
DUCKY:
Well, I won't know for certain

04:36.130 --> 04:37.956
until I get him
back on the table.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.782
Yeah, we got a through-and-
through here, Doctor.

04:39.826 --> 04:41.695
Ziva! You find that round?

04:42.956 --> 04:44.304
Found part of it.

04:44.347 --> 04:49.217
Shooter had to be standing
somewhere over there.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.565
Well, there's nothing
in the tub.

04:50.608 --> 04:52.304
Yep, nothing here.

04:52.347 --> 04:55.826
He policed his brass
or used a revolver.

04:55.869 --> 04:58.565
This could've been
a violent drowning.

04:58.608 --> 05:00.086
But perhaps not here.

05:00.130 --> 05:01.652
Body was dumped.

05:01.695 --> 05:04.086
If he was already dead when he
got here, then why shoot him?

05:04.130 --> 05:05.652
What have we here?

05:07.695 --> 05:09.739
DUCKY:
His abdomen's been slit open.

05:16.217 --> 05:17.652
Also his stomach.

05:17.695 --> 05:20.260
Somebody was
looking for something

05:20.304 --> 05:21.521
in our dead sailor.

05:21.565 --> 05:23.043
Why would they zip
his jacket back up?

05:23.086 --> 05:24.043
Dumped body.

05:24.086 --> 05:26.565
Easy to transport.
Less messy.

05:26.608 --> 05:28.826
Well, I don't see
anything, Doctor.

05:28.869 --> 05:30.782
Maybe they found what
they were looking for.

05:40.086 --> 05:43.608
ZIVA:
Petty Officer Edward Bick
grew up in Concord, California.

05:43.652 --> 05:46.217
Currently stationed at Norfolk,
assigned to the USS Lockwood.

05:46.260 --> 05:48.869
McGEE:
Bick recently served
two tours in Afghanistan.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.652
He was in the medical supply
corps for the last four years.

05:51.695 --> 05:52.913
Immaculate
service record.

05:52.956 --> 05:54.826
No enemies, no
disciplinary action.

05:54.869 --> 05:57.608
Yet he ends up
in a strange hot tub,

05:57.652 --> 05:58.782
filleted like a fish.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.130
Family.

06:00.173 --> 06:01.173
Married to his
high-school sweetheart.

06:01.217 --> 06:03.217
Tara Bick.

06:03.260 --> 06:05.869
She was a cheerleader;
he was her tight-end.

06:05.913 --> 06:07.739
Okay. Start with the wife.
Tony, Ziva.

06:07.782 --> 06:09.913
Um, I would prefer...I can't, she's very
talented but...

06:09.956 --> 06:11.956
And I would rather
be fishing. Go!

06:12.000 --> 06:14.956
Interviewing the widow, boss.

06:16.695 --> 06:18.826
McGee.

06:18.869 --> 06:21.043
Uh, I'll look,
I'll look into

06:21.086 --> 06:22.391
Bick's last movements,
before he disappeared.

06:22.434 --> 06:24.608
[typing]

06:24.652 --> 06:27.043
This wasn't supposed to happen.

06:27.086 --> 06:29.043
Eddie was being so careful.

06:29.086 --> 06:30.478
[sobbing quietly]

06:30.521 --> 06:31.652
[sniffles]

06:31.695 --> 06:34.130
We were about to
start a family.

06:34.173 --> 06:35.434
Is there anything
you can tell us

06:35.478 --> 06:36.913
about your husband,
Mrs. Bick?

06:36.956 --> 06:38.391
Had anything out of the
ordinary happened recently?

06:38.434 --> 06:39.434
Tara!

06:39.478 --> 06:41.000
Jason.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.304
I jumped in the car
as soon as I heard.

06:45.347 --> 06:47.521
I'm so sorry.

06:49.478 --> 06:52.565
Jason, these are
NCIS agents.

06:52.608 --> 06:55.000
They're investigating
Eddie's death.

06:55.043 --> 06:56.608
How did you know
Petty Officer Bick?

06:56.652 --> 06:59.478
Ed and I were stationed
on the Lockwoodtogether.

06:59.521 --> 07:01.695
JASON:
We were tight.

07:01.739 --> 07:03.478
I knew something
like this would happen.

07:03.521 --> 07:04.391
Knew how?

07:06.173 --> 07:08.130
Ed had been acting all nervous.

07:08.173 --> 07:10.521
Really out of character for him.

07:10.565 --> 07:12.391
Eddie was fearless.

07:12.434 --> 07:13.304
Tell them.

07:14.608 --> 07:16.173
Tara, I can't.

07:16.217 --> 07:18.173
TARA:
Tell them, Jason.

07:18.217 --> 07:20.695
Or I will.

07:20.739 --> 07:24.478
Eddie was selected for
a special duty assignment.

07:24.521 --> 07:26.043
Special assignment.

07:26.086 --> 07:27.913
On the Lockwood?

07:27.956 --> 07:31.304
No, Ed hadn't stepped foot on
the Lockwoodin over two months.

07:31.347 --> 07:33.826
Duty roster shows
he signed in every day.

07:33.869 --> 07:36.608
Yeah? Well, don't believe
everything you read.

07:36.652 --> 07:38.130
What's that supposed to mean?

07:38.173 --> 07:40.086
It means, whatever secret
assignment Ed was on,

07:40.130 --> 07:42.391
it probably got him killed.

07:42.434 --> 07:44.608
Well, do you know
that for a fact?

07:44.652 --> 07:47.782
My husband told me he
thought he was being watched.

07:47.826 --> 07:49.173
Was he?

07:49.217 --> 07:53.130
Three nights ago,
I heard something outside.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.391
I found Eddie peeking out
the living room window.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.913
He said somebody was
watching the house.

07:59.956 --> 08:01.260
Did you see anyone?

08:02.695 --> 08:04.739
No.

08:04.782 --> 08:06.608
But I heard
a car drive off.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.869
Whatever he saw,

08:08.913 --> 08:09.913
whoever he was
working with,

08:09.956 --> 08:13.086
that's what
got him killed.

08:19.173 --> 08:20.304
Hey, you got
anything, Duck?

08:20.347 --> 08:21.739
Ah, Jethro.

08:21.782 --> 08:23.913
Well, as I predicted,

08:23.956 --> 08:26.260
our petty officer suffered
a violent drowning

08:26.304 --> 08:28.956
and notwhere
the body was found.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.260
There were no algae
in his lungs

08:31.304 --> 08:32.695
or in his
nasal passages.

08:32.739 --> 08:36.652
But why someone should shoot
a man after they drown him

08:36.695 --> 08:37.478
remains a mystery.

08:37.521 --> 08:38.478
Bullet?

08:38.521 --> 08:39.869
Well, it entered

08:39.913 --> 08:41.913
here, it smashed the scapula,

08:41.956 --> 08:44.043
and then part of it exited

08:44.086 --> 08:46.000
and lodged in that
railroad tie behind him.

08:46.043 --> 08:48.739
I found a piece of bullet

08:48.782 --> 08:49.695
lodged in his shirt.

08:49.739 --> 08:50.956
It may match

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
the fragment
that Ziva found.

08:55.913 --> 08:57.652
What are you doing,
Palmer, making lunch?

08:57.695 --> 09:01.000
A... lung sandwich?

09:01.043 --> 09:03.086
I am so sorry. Not a sandwich.

09:03.130 --> 09:05.260
Dr. Mallard noticed
a slight irritation

09:05.304 --> 09:06.956
in the tissue
of the lining,

09:07.000 --> 09:09.565
indicating a possible
allergic reaction, so...

09:09.608 --> 09:11.173
Reaction?
Mm-hmm.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.695
To what?

09:12.739 --> 09:13.739
It's too soon to tell.

09:13.782 --> 09:16.652
But take a look at this

09:16.695 --> 09:18.217
depressed fracture
of his cranium.

09:18.260 --> 09:21.000
Note the indentation mark
on his right temple.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.043
Remind you of something?

09:22.086 --> 09:24.260
Bolt, maybe?

09:24.304 --> 09:26.391
Well, it's definitely
metal of some sort.

09:26.434 --> 09:29.391
We found minute filings and
traces of rust in the wound.

09:29.434 --> 09:31.043
I've sent everything
up to Abby.

09:32.347 --> 09:33.565
Hey.

09:33.608 --> 09:35.000
Wait a minute...

09:35.043 --> 09:36.434
Mr. Palmer!

09:36.478 --> 09:37.739
Yes, Doctor?

09:37.782 --> 09:40.304
A hemostat.
A small one.

09:40.347 --> 09:43.826
There's something impacted
between his molars.

09:56.217 --> 09:57.956
What is that?

09:58.000 --> 09:59.304
Looks like, uh...

09:59.347 --> 10:02.043
DUCKY:
Benjamin Franklin's
mouth and chin.

10:02.086 --> 10:03.913
Part of a hundred-dollar bill.

10:03.956 --> 10:05.173
Maybe that's what
they were looking for

10:05.217 --> 10:06.565
inside of his stomach?

10:06.608 --> 10:09.391
We found no traces of paper
in his digestive tract.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.695
Why would he swallow money?

10:15.217 --> 10:17.565
[elevator bell dings]ABBY: Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

10:17.608 --> 10:19.217
Abby!
Help!

10:19.260 --> 10:20.391
What are you doing?

10:20.434 --> 10:22.000
Stuck. I can't breathe.

10:22.043 --> 10:24.739
I've got a charley horse
in my right leg. Pull!

10:24.782 --> 10:28.391
[grunts and groans]

10:28.434 --> 10:31.565
It's like a thousand
cute little mice

10:31.608 --> 10:34.608
that are pulling
the flesh off my thigh

10:34.652 --> 10:35.608
with blowtorches...

10:35.652 --> 10:37.086
GIBBS:
Up. Move.

10:37.130 --> 10:38.869
...and little tiny
fondue forks. Ahh!

10:38.913 --> 10:40.521
Point your toe.

10:40.565 --> 10:42.869
So I bet you were wondering what
I was doing down there, huh?

10:42.913 --> 10:44.217
Uh, no.

10:44.260 --> 10:45.869
So last night I was
watching this documentary,

10:45.913 --> 10:47.260
which is what I do
when I can't sleep,

10:47.304 --> 10:48.608
which is like, every night,

10:48.652 --> 10:50.304
but last night, it was
about this circus performer

10:50.347 --> 10:52.913
who could compress
his body into spaces

10:52.956 --> 10:54.608
that are actually
smaller than his body mass

10:54.652 --> 10:56.304
which is actually
impossible, but--

10:56.347 --> 10:58.000
Abby.

10:58.043 --> 10:59.913
Okay, so the round

10:59.956 --> 11:01.739
fragmented into two
when it exited the body

11:01.782 --> 11:03.043
and it hit
the railroad tie.

11:03.086 --> 11:05.217
So I was able to process
each half separately,

11:05.260 --> 11:07.739
and then combine them
virtually, and... voilà !

11:07.782 --> 11:09.043
What about the gun?
Um...

11:09.086 --> 11:10.043
[typing]

11:10.086 --> 11:11.521
It's a Webley.

11:11.565 --> 11:13.086
English, a .38.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.652
It's rare. They don't
even make 'em anymore.

11:14.695 --> 11:16.913
Nice.
What else?

11:16.956 --> 11:19.000
Um, I tested the water
in Petty Officer Bick's lungs.

11:19.043 --> 11:21.478
There were high levels
of marine fuel

11:21.521 --> 11:24.304
and a lubricant used
mostly on large Navy vessels

11:24.347 --> 11:26.652
and it has oil
dispersants in it.

11:26.695 --> 11:28.086
That salt water or fresh water?

11:28.130 --> 11:29.304
It's both.

11:29.347 --> 11:32.478
So, the water that
Bick drowned in

11:32.521 --> 11:35.478
had to be in a place that had
salt water and fresh water,

11:35.521 --> 11:36.565
or at least condensation.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.130
Well, that's the
hull of a ship.

11:38.173 --> 11:40.739
There's only 900 ships docked
at Norfolk harbor right now,

11:40.782 --> 11:41.826
so that'll narrow it down.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.130
What about
the head wound?

11:43.173 --> 11:45.130
Metal shavings, rust
and a cleanser

11:45.173 --> 11:47.217
that's used exclusively
on marine craft.

11:47.260 --> 11:49.478
And the cleanser
is not American-made.

11:49.521 --> 11:50.913
You good?

11:50.956 --> 11:52.434
Yeah, I'm running the
impression spec right now,

11:52.478 --> 11:54.043
so if I could match
like a valve...

11:54.086 --> 11:56.043
Yeah, go.
Make it happen, Abbs.

11:56.086 --> 11:58.608
...a valve... or a flange...
to a specific ship...

11:58.652 --> 11:59.521
Thank you, Gibbs!

12:05.000 --> 12:05.956
Apologize.
For what?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.608
For being you.

12:07.652 --> 12:09.956
Sweetheart, if I had a dollar
for every time I'd done that,

12:10.000 --> 12:11.260
I'd be loaded.

12:11.304 --> 12:13.391
[typing]

12:13.434 --> 12:16.130
You could've just asked
to see my email.

12:16.173 --> 12:18.652
You knew I was curious;
you could've just told me.Hmm!

12:18.695 --> 12:19.826
Somebody tell me something.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.739
TONY:
Boss! This is what we've got.

12:25.391 --> 12:26.608
Nothing.

12:26.652 --> 12:28.434
McGee, explain why
we have nothing.

12:28.478 --> 12:30.304
McGEE:
We ran into a firewall, boss.

12:30.347 --> 12:33.086
Petty Officer Bick was working
on a classified Navy project

12:33.130 --> 12:34.913
in conjunction with the CIA,

12:34.956 --> 12:37.043
which NCIS hasn't
been read into.

12:37.086 --> 12:39.347
So until the SecNav
gives us access, we got--

12:40.782 --> 12:42.565
ABBY:
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

12:44.217 --> 12:46.521
I found our bolt of lightning.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.652
Actually, it's not a bolt.

12:48.695 --> 12:50.913
By mapping the impact
points on Bick's head,

12:50.956 --> 12:52.043
I matched it to a

12:52.086 --> 12:53.304
steam control valve.

12:53.347 --> 12:56.173
But not just any
steam control valve.

12:56.217 --> 12:58.086
This one is an exact match

12:58.130 --> 13:00.478
to a specific piece
of plumbing on a ship.

13:00.521 --> 13:01.652
Made by who?

13:01.695 --> 13:03.652
ABBY:
Barish Industries.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.304
They're out of Liverpool,

13:05.347 --> 13:07.869
but they make transport vessels
for the British Royal Navy.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.130
[typing]

13:10.173 --> 13:12.434
The only British Royal Navy ship
currently berthed at Norfolk

13:12.478 --> 13:13.956
is the HMS Sparrow-Hawk.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.130
So that means
the murder occurred

13:15.173 --> 13:17.130
on a British naval vessel.

13:17.173 --> 13:19.130
Which means our crime scene
technically on British soil.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.782
Do we have the authority
to investigate this, boss?

13:31.086 --> 13:32.695
[conversing quietly]

13:32.739 --> 13:35.695
Major Malloy, British Royal
Marines, Special Agent Gibbs.

13:35.739 --> 13:37.652
Pleasure to make
your acquaintance .

13:37.695 --> 13:39.739
VANCE:
Major Malloy's the liaison
between the U.S. and British

13:39.782 --> 13:42.260
Navies while their
ship's in our port.

13:42.304 --> 13:45.217
Mm. We need access
to your ship.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.521
VANCE:
I've already
requested permission

13:47.565 --> 13:49.521
for NCIS to board
the Sparrow-Hawk.

13:49.565 --> 13:51.217
And unfortunately,

13:51.260 --> 13:53.217
Sparrow-Hawk'sorders
are to set sail at 1100.

13:53.260 --> 13:54.826
Right.

13:54.869 --> 13:57.565
But we have reason to believe
a U.S. sailor died on board.

13:57.608 --> 13:59.043
Means your ship's
a crime scene.

13:59.086 --> 14:00.130
Yes. Unfortunately,
my orders--

14:00.173 --> 14:01.434
U.K. and the U.S.

14:01.478 --> 14:03.000
have a status-of-forces
agreement.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.565
I'm well aware
of that agreement.

14:04.608 --> 14:07.739
Then you're aware that NCIS has
the authority to investigate

14:07.782 --> 14:10.086
a crime committed on a
British ship in U.S. waters.

14:10.130 --> 14:11.869
With one exception.

14:11.913 --> 14:13.652
If the mission

14:13.695 --> 14:15.739
of the British vessel is
deemed of a critical nature.

14:15.782 --> 14:18.913
Then its departure
cannot be disrupted.

14:18.956 --> 14:20.652
I'm terribly sorry,
gentlemen, but I'm afraid

14:20.695 --> 14:22.695
Her Majesty's vessel will
be leaving in two hours.

14:31.478 --> 14:32.913
GIBBS:
Good luck getting
out of port.

14:32.956 --> 14:34.565
Excuse me.

14:34.608 --> 14:35.826
Am I missing something
here? I'm sorry...

14:35.869 --> 14:36.826
Yeah.

14:36.869 --> 14:38.304
[door slams]

14:38.347 --> 14:39.608
You're sailing off
with my crime scene!

14:39.652 --> 14:40.521
Gibbs...

14:42.086 --> 14:44.782
You Yanks really are a bit
like John Wayne, aren't you?

14:44.826 --> 14:46.695
Gary Cooper.

14:46.739 --> 14:48.000
Oh, Sergeant York.

14:48.043 --> 14:50.652
How silly of me. Yes.

14:50.695 --> 14:52.478
You know, I heard you're
a former Marine, Gibbs.

14:52.521 --> 14:55.304
Always a Marine, Malloy.

14:55.347 --> 14:58.434
Mm. Well, did you know
that your Marine Corps

14:58.478 --> 14:59.695
was modeled after its
British counterpart?

14:59.739 --> 15:00.956
What's your point?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.434
I think you should
remember that we are allies.

15:03.478 --> 15:06.043
And I think you should
start acting like one.

15:06.086 --> 15:07.391
I've got a murderer
on my hands.

15:07.434 --> 15:09.217
Maybe, he's
on your ship.

15:09.260 --> 15:12.565
I'm calling SecNav.

15:12.608 --> 15:17.130
Before the two of you get into
a saber duel in the parking lot.

15:17.173 --> 15:19.695
VANCE:
Get me the Secretary
of the Navy.

15:19.739 --> 15:21.173
MALLOY:
Charming facility.

15:22.173 --> 15:23.565
Agent Gibbs.

15:26.173 --> 15:27.173
Is this your team?

15:30.043 --> 15:31.304
Everybody:

15:31.347 --> 15:32.391
Peter Malloy.

15:32.434 --> 15:34.304
Major, British
Royal Marines.

15:34.347 --> 15:36.478
Probationary Agent
Ziva David.

15:36.521 --> 15:40.217
Now... Israeli. Tel Aviv.

15:40.260 --> 15:42.478
Do I detect a trace
of the Haifa Coast?

15:42.521 --> 15:43.826
Very good.

15:43.869 --> 15:45.043
North London.

15:45.086 --> 15:46.739
Ah. Precisely, yes.

15:46.782 --> 15:48.434
Pleasure's all
mine, mate.

15:48.478 --> 15:49.695
Anthony DiNozzo.

15:49.739 --> 15:51.086
My brother's name
is Anthony.

15:51.130 --> 15:52.434
Best man at my wedding.

15:52.478 --> 15:53.739
It was a previous
marriage, of course.

15:53.782 --> 15:55.130
Of course.

15:55.173 --> 15:56.521
MALLOY:
And who might you be, sir?

15:56.565 --> 15:58.521
Ah, I'm Special Agent
Timothy McGee.

15:58.565 --> 15:59.826
Oh, an Irishman.

15:59.869 --> 16:02.173
Well, I promise I won't
hold that against you.

16:02.217 --> 16:03.826
Ha!

16:03.869 --> 16:04.869
Okay.

16:04.913 --> 16:06.086
We done with our
tea and crumpets?

16:06.130 --> 16:07.913
Malloy... beat it.

16:07.956 --> 16:09.304
VANCE:
Not so fast.

16:09.347 --> 16:10.608
SecNav has granted NCIS

16:10.652 --> 16:12.913
permission to board
the Sparrow-Hawk.

16:12.956 --> 16:14.826
Yes, well, I shall
need to get clearance

16:14.869 --> 16:15.956
from Fleet Command
in London.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.913
You understand.
It's a formality.

16:17.956 --> 16:19.347
Long as it doesn't take time.

16:20.173 --> 16:21.478
Agent David.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.304
VANCE:
Have you ever
been to Zurich?

16:25.347 --> 16:27.913
Several times.

16:27.956 --> 16:29.391
Good. Today,
you're Switzerland,

16:29.434 --> 16:32.217
between England and the U.S.

16:32.260 --> 16:33.173
Boss, Abby needs
to see you.

16:40.000 --> 16:40.869
Abby.

16:43.956 --> 16:45.521
Exhibit A.

16:45.565 --> 16:49.043
Actually, it's
evidence exhibit 2731.

16:49.086 --> 16:51.086
In this jar

16:51.130 --> 16:53.173
is the scrap of the
hundred-dollar bill
that was pulled from

16:53.217 --> 16:54.304
Petty Officer
Bick's la boca.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.782
La bocais Spanish
for--

16:55.826 --> 16:57.913
Mouth. Yeah, I know, Abbs.
Use yours. Faster. Please.

16:57.956 --> 16:59.565
Well, allow me to
show you the money.

17:02.782 --> 17:06.260
The money is coated in an
ultraviolet fluorescent powder.

17:06.304 --> 17:07.913
It's invisible to the naked eye.

17:07.956 --> 17:09.652
Undetectable, except
for the black light,

17:09.695 --> 17:12.478
and it's transferable
to anyone who touches it.

17:12.521 --> 17:14.695
So, anyone who
touches the cash--

17:14.739 --> 17:16.217
Lights up like a Christmas tree.

17:16.260 --> 17:17.869
Now, I ran the
black light over

17:17.913 --> 17:19.608
Petty Officer
Bick's stomach.

17:19.652 --> 17:21.565
He swallowed at least
one entire bill

17:21.608 --> 17:24.217
before someone
cut it out of him.

17:24.260 --> 17:25.260
But watch this.

17:27.565 --> 17:29.043
[radio static]

17:29.086 --> 17:31.521
Radioactive?
Nope. Better.

17:31.565 --> 17:35.043
The cash is emitting
low-watt radio waves.

17:35.086 --> 17:36.739
Old-school.

17:36.782 --> 17:39.260
I mean, we're talking
crystal radio technology.

17:39.304 --> 17:40.608
You're kidding me.

17:42.130 --> 17:44.260
I built a crystal
radio when I was 11.

17:44.304 --> 17:46.043
ABBY:
So, the powder

17:46.086 --> 17:49.086
is emitting a radio signal.
If we knew the frequency,

17:49.130 --> 17:50.739
you could track this cash,

17:50.782 --> 17:52.173
and anyone who touched it,
for miles.

17:52.217 --> 17:53.652
Okay. So we can track it.

17:53.695 --> 17:55.086
No, because we
don't have enough

17:55.130 --> 17:56.695
to determine
the exact frequency.

17:56.739 --> 17:57.695
The sample's too small.

17:57.739 --> 17:59.000
We need more dinero
for that.

17:59.043 --> 18:00.043
Dinerois Spanish for--

18:00.086 --> 18:01.086
Yeah, I know, Abbs.

18:01.130 --> 18:03.217
So where do we find the dinero?

18:03.260 --> 18:06.391
Well, since the CIA uses this
tracking technology, Gibbs,

18:06.434 --> 18:08.521
the CIA's ATM.

18:15.956 --> 18:16.956
Ms. Tennison?

18:18.173 --> 18:20.739
Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

18:20.782 --> 18:24.739
You, uh, you head of the
CIA office here in Norfolk?

18:24.782 --> 18:25.739
Thanks.

18:25.782 --> 18:26.956
Uh... walk with me.

18:27.000 --> 18:27.608
Thank you.

18:29.869 --> 18:30.826
You know this sailor?

18:30.869 --> 18:33.043
No.

18:33.086 --> 18:36.739
His name's Petty Officer
Edward Bick.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.000
We think he was working
with the CIA here in Norfolk.

18:40.043 --> 18:41.913
CIA doesn't operate
domestically.

18:41.956 --> 18:42.913
[chuckles]

18:42.956 --> 18:44.869
Really. What's
all this, then?

18:44.913 --> 18:47.086
TENNISON:
Staging for an
operation off-shore.

18:47.130 --> 18:51.043
Did, uh, Bick work
with you or not?

18:51.086 --> 18:52.043
Hold on.

18:52.086 --> 18:53.782
Hey.

18:53.826 --> 18:55.260
This man was murdered.

18:55.304 --> 18:56.521
In Norfolk, here.

18:58.391 --> 19:00.347
If you know something
about it, now would be

19:00.391 --> 19:01.913
a pretty damn good
time to tell me.

19:01.956 --> 19:03.304
Like I said,

19:03.347 --> 19:06.130
the Central Intelligence
Agency is restricted from

19:06.173 --> 19:08.304
conducting operations within
the borders of this country.

19:08.347 --> 19:13.347
So, if he was killed here,
we have no knowledge of it.

19:13.391 --> 19:15.739
We found this inside him.

19:15.782 --> 19:19.086
Piece of a tagged
one-hundred-dollar bill.

19:19.130 --> 19:20.695
Figure it belongs to you.

19:23.173 --> 19:26.304
I think somebody stole
CIA money in Norfolk.

19:26.347 --> 19:27.478
And whoever stole that money,

19:27.521 --> 19:29.695
killed a United States
petty officer.

19:31.782 --> 19:35.739
There was a CIA mission to
deliver cash to warlords

19:35.782 --> 19:37.956
and tribal leaders in
Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

19:38.000 --> 19:42.043
Sometimes we pay the
enemies of our enemies.

19:42.086 --> 19:43.913
Helmund is under
British control.

19:43.956 --> 19:46.173
May I go now?

19:47.304 --> 19:48.304
How much money?

19:52.304 --> 19:53.695
[sighs]

19:53.739 --> 19:55.913
We scrubbed the
mission last week.

19:55.956 --> 19:58.391
The money never made
it onto the ship.

19:58.434 --> 20:02.173
Petty Officer Bick couldn't
have been killed for the cash.

20:02.217 --> 20:03.869
I'm afraid I can't help you.

20:06.695 --> 20:08.608
[cell phone rings]

20:10.304 --> 20:11.782
Yeah. It's Gibbs.

20:11.826 --> 20:13.304
TONY:
Boss, Malloy's
at NATO Headquarters,

20:13.347 --> 20:14.347
trying to get permission
to set sail.

20:14.391 --> 20:16.260
Well, don't let him leave.

20:20.434 --> 20:21.869
What?

20:21.913 --> 20:26.130
I'm just watching the pheromones
ooze from your body.

20:26.173 --> 20:28.913
I do not see anything.

20:28.956 --> 20:30.521
[laughs]
That's because
they're invisible.

20:30.565 --> 20:32.608
It's just a musky scent

20:32.652 --> 20:34.260
given off to attract
the opposite sex.

20:34.304 --> 20:35.913
Now you're being
ridiculous.

20:35.956 --> 20:36.913
Oh, no. It's true.

20:36.956 --> 20:38.130
Think about it.

20:38.173 --> 20:39.434
First you had
your little Miami Vice.

20:39.478 --> 20:41.130
Now Prince Albert in a can.

20:41.173 --> 20:43.043
[laughing]

20:43.086 --> 20:44.739
Oh, they can't help it.

20:44.782 --> 20:46.869
You're just a walking
Israeli love machine.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.130
He is...

20:48.173 --> 20:49.521
charming.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.434
What is it with chicks
and Brits?

20:51.478 --> 20:53.434
Jagger, Bono,
Beatles, Bond.

20:53.478 --> 20:55.130
I'm not into bondage.

20:55.173 --> 20:56.347
I can assure you.

20:56.391 --> 20:57.434
Hello.

20:57.478 --> 20:58.913
How are you?

20:58.956 --> 21:01.130
Oh, bad news, I'm afraid.

21:01.173 --> 21:03.043
British Fleet Command
and CENTCOM

21:03.086 --> 21:04.521
have just requested
that we leave immediately.

21:04.565 --> 21:07.000
Tell your Agent Gibbs
I am sorry.

21:11.826 --> 21:13.130
Well...

21:13.173 --> 21:15.608
It takes a big ship several
minutes to get underway.

21:18.913 --> 21:21.565
Couldn't we
just do a quickie?

21:25.608 --> 21:27.521
[indistinct PA announcement,
ship horn blows]

21:34.043 --> 21:37.260
TONY:
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

21:37.304 --> 21:39.652
Why would anyone leave a needle
in a stack of hay, anyway?

21:39.695 --> 21:41.043
Oh, Lord.

21:41.086 --> 21:43.086
So, according to
the ship plans Abby sent,

21:43.130 --> 21:46.478
the valve in question...

21:46.521 --> 21:49.304
should be somewhere

21:49.347 --> 21:50.782
through here.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.347
[water dripping]

21:58.521 --> 21:59.652
Tony, look
over there.

22:01.347 --> 22:02.391
I see it.

22:03.086 --> 22:04.130
Perfect match.

22:05.347 --> 22:06.217
Well, that's enough water

22:06.260 --> 22:07.478
to drown a man.

22:07.521 --> 22:09.086
[metal rumbling]

22:09.130 --> 22:11.521
There you are.

22:11.565 --> 22:13.652
CENTCOM's just moved up
our departure.

22:13.695 --> 22:14.739
You'll have to leave.

22:14.782 --> 22:16.260
What about
our quickie?

22:16.304 --> 22:18.173
Weather alert.

22:18.217 --> 22:19.391
Headwinds off
the Atlantic current

22:19.434 --> 22:20.652
require us to depart
immediately.

22:20.695 --> 22:22.173
But we just found
our crime scene.

22:22.217 --> 22:24.652
Oh, that's a pity.

22:24.695 --> 22:26.478
My men will have to deal
with it from our end.

22:26.521 --> 22:27.565
I have my orders.

22:27.608 --> 22:29.043
What if we want
to stay on board?

22:29.086 --> 22:30.521
12 miles out to sea,
and you'll be in

22:30.565 --> 22:31.695
international waters.

22:31.739 --> 22:32.826
Your jurisdiction ends there.

22:32.869 --> 22:33.739
Follow me.

22:42.347 --> 22:44.347
I'm calling Gibbs.

22:44.391 --> 22:47.913
[alarm blaring]

22:47.956 --> 22:49.130
Excuse me.

22:49.173 --> 22:50.217
What's happening?

22:50.260 --> 22:51.608
It's a warning light
for the turbines.

22:51.652 --> 22:53.173
It could be nothing,
but we have to run a diagnostic.

22:57.913 --> 22:59.304
Hey. Trouble?

22:59.347 --> 23:01.217
Big ship.

23:01.260 --> 23:03.695
A lot could go wrong.

23:07.826 --> 23:09.086
Boss.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.391
Get back down there,
keep processing.

23:13.434 --> 23:14.521
Oh, lucky break, huh?

23:14.565 --> 23:15.521
We got some time.

23:15.565 --> 23:16.434
DiNozzo.

23:17.347 --> 23:19.521
No such thing as luck.

23:30.130 --> 23:31.913
Are you accusing me
of something, Malloy?

23:31.956 --> 23:32.913
Yes, sabotage.

23:32.956 --> 23:34.565
That's a serious accusation.

23:34.608 --> 23:35.695
It's a serious
crime, mate.

23:35.739 --> 23:36.695
Prove it.

23:36.739 --> 23:38.000
JAMISON:
Bracket broke loose

23:38.043 --> 23:39.434
in the engine room;
we replaced it.

23:39.478 --> 23:40.391
We depart

23:40.434 --> 23:42.130
in ten minutes.

23:42.173 --> 23:45.608
Please escort your people
from my ship.

23:54.695 --> 23:56.739
What did Gibbs say
we were looking for?

23:56.782 --> 23:58.782
Pixie dust.

23:58.826 --> 24:00.347
We're looking
for drugs now?

24:00.391 --> 24:02.826
Not exactly, Tinker Bell.

24:02.869 --> 24:05.739
Would you please, uh, find out
how to turn off that light?

24:05.782 --> 24:08.043
'Cause I need it as dark
as possible in here, thanks.

24:13.956 --> 24:16.086
Better?

24:16.130 --> 24:18.086
Yeah, that's much
better, thanks.

24:18.130 --> 24:20.652
[engines starting up,
Klaxon sounds]
Uh-oh.

24:20.695 --> 24:23.173
They're preparing
to leave port.
Yeah.

24:23.217 --> 24:25.695
TONY:
You see how the racking powder
shows up in the black light?

24:26.652 --> 24:28.913
What do you know.

24:28.956 --> 24:31.043
Money talks.

24:31.086 --> 24:32.347
[camera snaps]

24:32.391 --> 24:34.739
Okay, put these last two
on the manifest

24:34.782 --> 24:36.217
and give me an inventory report

24:36.260 --> 24:37.608
of everything
coming off the ship.

24:37.652 --> 24:39.217
Okay.Thank you.

24:39.260 --> 24:40.869
Agent Gibbs.

24:40.913 --> 24:42.652
There someplace
we can talk?

24:42.695 --> 24:44.565
I thought we
already talked.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.434
Talk again?

24:46.478 --> 24:47.956
You lied to me.

24:49.565 --> 24:51.304
Money was on this ship.

24:51.347 --> 24:52.565
No, there wasn't.

24:52.608 --> 24:54.565
We scrubbed the
last mission.

24:54.608 --> 24:56.869
But we've used that ship before
to transport painted cash.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.347
So we can
track it back

24:58.391 --> 25:00.086
to targets we might
want to eliminate.

25:00.130 --> 25:01.608
Just not this time.

25:01.652 --> 25:03.782
According to the ship
logs on the Sparrow-Hawk,

25:03.826 --> 25:06.260
that ship hasn't been to
the Mid East one time.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.739
Not one time.

25:07.782 --> 25:09.130
[sighs]

25:09.173 --> 25:11.043
We are the CIA, Agent Gibbs.

25:11.086 --> 25:12.782
We don't leave paper trails.

25:12.826 --> 25:14.782
He swallowed the money
just before he died

25:14.826 --> 25:16.913
to prove that
it was there.

25:28.391 --> 25:30.478
Listen, I worked with
Petty Officer Bick.

25:30.521 --> 25:31.913
Okay, he was
a good guy.

25:31.956 --> 25:33.086
I liked him a lot.

25:33.130 --> 25:37.130
Got a funny way
of showing it, ma'am.

25:37.173 --> 25:39.043
There were only
three people

25:39.086 --> 25:41.869
who knew the money was
on board that ship.

25:41.913 --> 25:44.043
Bick, who was in
charge of guarding it;

25:44.086 --> 25:45.826
myself, who just lost

25:45.869 --> 25:48.913
$3 million
in CIA money;

25:48.956 --> 25:51.782
and the limey bastard in
charge of coordinating

25:51.826 --> 25:54.565
the helicopter money drops
to Helmand Province.

25:54.608 --> 25:56.043
Malloy.

25:56.086 --> 25:57.043
Yeah.

25:57.086 --> 25:58.739
You do the math.

25:58.782 --> 25:59.782
[phone ringing]

25:59.826 --> 26:01.086
[phone beeps on]

26:03.086 --> 26:04.478
GIBBS:
What, McGee?Boss, hey.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.043
I got surveillance footage in

26:06.086 --> 26:07.652
from the east gate
at the Norfolk shipyard.

26:07.695 --> 26:09.043
Yeah, and?

26:09.086 --> 26:10.869
Shows Major Malloy's car
leaving the gate

26:10.913 --> 26:12.347
minutes after Bick was murdered.

26:12.391 --> 26:14.217
Phone records?

26:14.260 --> 26:16.478
Let me access
his British carrier.

26:16.521 --> 26:17.826
[computer trilling]

26:19.130 --> 26:21.217
Call was made from Malloy's cell

26:21.260 --> 26:23.347
less than a quarter-mile
from where the body was dumped

26:23.391 --> 26:24.782
the night of the murder, boss.

26:24.826 --> 26:26.913
Get DiNozzo and Ziva
to go pick him up.

26:26.956 --> 26:28.652
Isn't he on the ship?

26:28.695 --> 26:31.043
Send a helo from Norfolk.

26:31.086 --> 26:33.043
That ship is still
in American waters.

26:33.086 --> 26:34.130
Got it.

26:34.173 --> 26:35.347
[phone beeps off]

26:41.869 --> 26:43.391
You know, it's hardly surprising

26:43.434 --> 26:45.652
all of your tea
tastes like paper, now, is it?

26:56.826 --> 26:59.130
Petty Officer Bick was
assigned guard duty

26:59.173 --> 27:03.869
to watch over $3 million
in marked CIA cash.

27:03.913 --> 27:06.130
Well, I'm a liaison officer.

27:06.173 --> 27:07.739
I just coordinate
between the Royal Navy,

27:07.782 --> 27:09.304
U.S. and NATO forces.

27:09.347 --> 27:11.478
Where's the money?

27:11.521 --> 27:14.608
I have no idea.

27:16.391 --> 27:18.000
You own a
Webley revolver?

27:20.391 --> 27:21.869
I do, yes.

27:21.913 --> 27:23.043
It's in my flat in London.

27:25.478 --> 27:28.652
The, uh, flat in London
that's in foreclosure?

27:32.434 --> 27:34.695
Had a few poor investments
in Greece.

27:34.739 --> 27:36.260
Hmm.

27:36.304 --> 27:38.304
That's an interesting
motive for stealing cash

27:38.347 --> 27:39.608
from the CIA's slush fund

27:39.652 --> 27:42.043
that they wouldn't
want reported missing.

27:42.086 --> 27:45.217
Well, that's interesting
conjecture.

27:45.260 --> 27:49.652
Call the night of the murder
came from your cell phone.

27:49.695 --> 27:51.739
Four blocks from
where the body was dumped.

27:54.652 --> 27:57.869
Right, well, there's only two
tiny flaws in your theory here.

28:00.043 --> 28:03.739
I didn't kill anyone,
and I didn't steal the currency.

28:03.782 --> 28:05.913
I mean, where is
the cash, Gibbs?

28:05.956 --> 28:07.000
Where is it?

28:07.043 --> 28:08.608
Where's any evidence,
for that matter?

28:08.652 --> 28:10.391
Where is DNA?
Where is a murder weapon?

28:10.434 --> 28:11.739
Where is an eyewitness?

28:11.782 --> 28:13.217
You know,
I-I should like to call

28:13.260 --> 28:15.000
the British Consulate
now, please.

28:22.478 --> 28:25.434
All right, you have to
press charges or I'm walking.

28:27.391 --> 28:29.478
You have absolutely
no right to keep me here.

28:37.130 --> 28:38.043
[door closes]

28:39.434 --> 28:42.913
Abby, talk to me, now.

28:42.956 --> 28:45.434
Somebody took a bite out of
the crabby apple tree today.

28:45.478 --> 28:46.739
Abby.

28:46.782 --> 28:47.739
Okay, bad news.

28:47.782 --> 28:48.739
Still can't I.D.

28:48.782 --> 28:50.434
the trace elements that caused

28:50.478 --> 28:52.608
the allergic reaction in Petty
Officer Bick's lung tissue.

28:52.652 --> 28:54.695
You called me down here
to tell me what you don't have?

28:54.739 --> 28:56.347
Oh, blasphemy!
I would never do that.

28:56.391 --> 28:58.260
I got a clean print
on Major Malloy.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.304
Never throw your tea
away at NCIS, Gibbs.

29:01.347 --> 29:02.782
Yeah, and?

29:02.826 --> 29:05.000
And I ran it through NATO,
Interpol and the British

29:05.043 --> 29:06.391
Royal Navy databases--
nothing, Gibbs.

29:06.434 --> 29:07.565
He's not in
any of them.

29:07.608 --> 29:09.000
How great is that?

29:09.043 --> 29:11.086
The guy's a-a bogus
British sailor.

29:11.130 --> 29:12.086
He's a faux seaman.

29:12.130 --> 29:13.565
He's an imposter.
Who is he?

29:13.608 --> 29:15.434
He's MI-6.

29:15.478 --> 29:17.608
British Secret Service.

29:17.652 --> 29:20.043
He's on a special attaché
attached to the Sparrow-Hawk

29:20.086 --> 29:21.434
whenever it's docked
in an American port.

29:25.608 --> 29:28.260
Where's Malloy?

29:28.304 --> 29:29.913
Walked out
a while ago, boss,

29:29.956 --> 29:32.652
with a rep from
the British Consulate.

29:32.695 --> 29:34.043
McGee, track his cell phone.

29:34.086 --> 29:35.217
On it.

29:35.260 --> 29:37.043
[typing]

29:37.086 --> 29:38.826
[computer trilling]

29:38.869 --> 29:40.347
I can't. He's turned it off.

29:40.391 --> 29:42.521
Then track something
from the past few weeks.

29:42.565 --> 29:44.826
Cell footprints.

29:47.086 --> 29:49.086
He's made multiple calls
from a single location.

29:49.130 --> 29:51.782
Here in D.C.? I thought he was
on a ship in Norfolk.

29:54.000 --> 29:55.347
Give me a location.

29:55.391 --> 29:56.739
It's a hotel.

29:56.782 --> 29:58.000
The Drake.

29:58.043 --> 29:59.086
Constitution and
14th Southwest.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.608
Okay. Ziva, DiNozzo,
you're with me.

30:03.695 --> 30:05.478
He's in room 238, boss.

30:19.521 --> 30:20.782
Anything?

30:20.826 --> 30:22.086
We're clear.

30:22.130 --> 30:23.086
Clear.

30:24.173 --> 30:26.956
I'll put a
BOLO out.

30:27.000 --> 30:28.000
Yeah, Ziva.

30:34.521 --> 30:36.434
Tracking powder.

30:38.086 --> 30:40.826
Money was here.

30:40.869 --> 30:43.217
Malloy and the money both gone.

30:52.782 --> 30:54.173
DiNozzo.

30:54.217 --> 30:55.478
BOLOs-R-Us, boss.

30:55.521 --> 30:57.260
We got the entire
Eastern seaboard covered.

30:57.304 --> 31:00.000
Metro P.D. is on the bus,
train and subway stations.

31:00.043 --> 31:01.217
We've alerted airport police,
the state troopers

31:01.260 --> 31:02.304
in Maryland and Virginia.

31:02.347 --> 31:03.913
Customs and ICE
are staying frosty.

31:03.956 --> 31:05.130
Secret Service Uniformed
Division is monitoring

31:05.173 --> 31:06.739
the British Embassy
and Consulate.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.826
McGEE:
And the Coast Guard's
got the shipyards wired.

31:08.869 --> 31:09.521
Good work.

31:10.913 --> 31:12.086
Complimented us.

31:12.130 --> 31:13.130
That's never a good sign.

31:13.173 --> 31:14.956
Congratulations, Agent Gibbs.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.217
You've somehow managed to tick
off both your own government

31:17.260 --> 31:18.478
and one of our closest allies.

31:18.521 --> 31:20.739
Call the CIA, have them
track their money.

31:20.782 --> 31:22.565
Tennison's already
complained about you.

31:22.608 --> 31:24.695
The tracking powder
wasn't meant to help us.

31:24.739 --> 31:27.260
CIA doesn't want this cas
solved, they want it to go away.

31:27.304 --> 31:28.869
ZIVA:
Why?

31:28.913 --> 31:31.260
Paying criminals in the Middle
East is not a state secret.

31:31.304 --> 31:32.826
This time, it's different.

31:32.869 --> 31:35.043
These payments were earmarked
for groups in Afghanistan.

31:35.086 --> 31:37.347
Groups that we're not supposed
to be in business with.

31:37.391 --> 31:39.913
Then let's get out of business
with them and solve this case.

31:39.956 --> 31:42.478
The CIA brought down the Taliban
in eight weeks back in '02;

31:42.521 --> 31:44.826
I think they've earned
a little leeway.

31:44.869 --> 31:46.869
Ziva, contact the British
Consulate worker...

31:46.913 --> 31:47.739
You've done enough.

31:50.565 --> 31:51.521
Cool off, Gibbs.

31:51.565 --> 31:52.608
We'll catch this killer.

31:52.652 --> 31:54.304
I don't want this to turn into

31:54.347 --> 31:56.521
some international incident.

[slamming phone]

32:03.478 --> 32:04.521

[door slams shut]

32:19.086 --> 32:21.913
MALLOY:
Cheers, Gibbs.

32:21.956 --> 32:24.434
You know, it does read "beer"
on the label here,

32:24.478 --> 32:26.347
but unfortunately
it tastes

32:26.391 --> 32:28.913
rather more like horse
excrement.

32:28.956 --> 32:31.826
MI-6 knows my address.
I'm flattered.

32:31.869 --> 32:34.434
Yes, I do apologize
if I misled you.

32:34.478 --> 32:38.391
What are you
doing here, really?

32:38.434 --> 32:41.304
I need your help.

32:43.739 --> 32:45.521
[sighs]

32:45.565 --> 32:47.826
I'm not a lawyer.No, well, it's not

32:47.869 --> 32:49.565
your law that I'm
in trouble with.

32:49.608 --> 32:51.913
It's much worse than that.
Do you have pretzels?

32:59.000 --> 33:01.478
You have ten seconds...

33:03.173 --> 33:06.173
...until I accidentally shoot
you for trespassing.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.086
I've been set up.

33:12.304 --> 33:14.565
You know,
I thought MI-6 were good,

33:14.608 --> 33:19.739
but your CIA,
they're very impressive.

33:19.782 --> 33:23.086
That three million in marked CIA
money, it was on the ship.

33:24.869 --> 33:26.130
[Velcro rips]

33:29.130 --> 33:32.434
$10,000.
That's for the beer.

33:32.478 --> 33:33.956
You can keep the change.

33:39.086 --> 33:41.391
That's for the ship.

33:41.434 --> 33:43.695
Should be enough currency there

33:43.739 --> 33:46.043
for you to track
the CIA frequency.

33:46.086 --> 33:48.173
That'll lead you to the rest,

33:48.217 --> 33:52.304
and to the person who is
responsible.

33:52.347 --> 33:54.913
What's in it for me?

33:54.956 --> 33:56.739
You get your killer.

33:56.782 --> 33:59.913
Hmm? What's in it for you?

33:59.956 --> 34:02.173
I don't get killed.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.391
Hey, boss, good news.

34:07.434 --> 34:08.652
A guy fitting Malloy's
description

34:08.695 --> 34:10.260
just paid cash
for a ticket to Glasgow.

34:10.304 --> 34:13.086
It wasn't me.

34:13.130 --> 34:14.695
Gibbs, how did
you find him?I didn't.

34:14.739 --> 34:15.956
He found me.

34:16.000 --> 34:17.869
Ziva, you watch him.

34:17.913 --> 34:21.130
Watch him like Syria,
not Switzerland.

34:21.173 --> 34:22.347
Mm-hmm.[cell phone rings]

34:22.391 --> 34:23.782
Yeah, Abby, hi.

34:23.826 --> 34:25.913
Gibbs, I got something.Yeah. Coming.

34:25.956 --> 34:28.043
TONY: So, you're a
British person.Yes, I am.

34:28.086 --> 34:29.478
You like Peter Sellers?

34:29.521 --> 34:31.000
Yes, I do.

34:31.043 --> 34:31.826
What's his best movie?

34:34.347 --> 34:36.043
Strangelove.

34:36.086 --> 34:37.652
Kubrick.

34:37.695 --> 34:38.869
That's good.

34:38.913 --> 34:40.434
It's not his best.

34:40.478 --> 34:41.869
That would be Being There.

34:41.913 --> 34:45.086
Nice. Well, do you like
What's New, Pussycat?

34:45.130 --> 34:46.913
Sellers is terrific in that.

34:46.956 --> 34:48.217
You like Dudley Moore?

34:48.260 --> 34:49.521
Yes, I do like Dudley Moore.

34:49.565 --> 34:52.086
But I prefer his earlier work
with Peter Cook.

34:52.130 --> 34:54.695
Peter Cook?
Peter Cook!

34:54.739 --> 34:56.782
Nobody knows about
Peter Cook anymore.

34:56.826 --> 34:58.739
Beyond the Fringe?Oh, it's just
extraordinary.

35:00.565 --> 35:04.130
Gibbs, meet my
new main squeeze.

35:04.173 --> 35:06.434
This is Ken the SEM.

35:06.478 --> 35:08.478
My new scanning
electron microscope.

35:08.521 --> 35:11.304
This baby can magnify
up to 500,000 times.

35:11.347 --> 35:12.478
Mm-hmm. See anything good?

35:12.521 --> 35:14.565
Pollen!

35:14.608 --> 35:16.217
GIBBS:
Pollen?

35:16.260 --> 35:19.260
It's only the biggest forensic
science breakthrough since DNA.

35:19.304 --> 35:21.000
And this isn't
just any pollen.

35:21.043 --> 35:24.000
It's a specific strain of
the Cordyline fruticosa.

35:24.043 --> 35:25.478
See, every plant

35:25.521 --> 35:27.652
has its own fingerprint,
as specific

35:27.695 --> 35:30.347
and unique as DNA.
This pollen came from

35:30.391 --> 35:31.695
Petty Officer Bick's
lung tissue.

35:31.739 --> 35:33.000
This helps us how?

35:33.043 --> 35:35.913
Pollen is embedded
in everything.

35:35.956 --> 35:37.739
And it stays embedded
for months.

35:37.782 --> 35:39.304
It's nearly impossible
to wash off.

35:39.347 --> 35:40.956
It sticks using

35:41.000 --> 35:43.478
these microscopic
little hookie things.Meaning?

35:43.521 --> 35:46.130
Meaning, I can track where
someone's been

35:46.173 --> 35:48.260
and who they've been in close
contact with simply by

35:48.304 --> 35:50.478
looking at the pollen spores
that are in their clothes,

35:50.521 --> 35:52.782
and their hair
and their lungs...What's the point, Abbs?

35:52.826 --> 35:55.782
The pollen that was in
Petty Officer Bick's lungs

35:55.826 --> 35:58.304
is found only one
place on earth...

36:01.304 --> 36:03.173
Diego Garcia?

36:03.217 --> 36:06.565
An isolated military base in the
middle of the Indian Ocean.

36:06.608 --> 36:10.000
Guess where Petty Officer
Bick has never been

36:10.043 --> 36:11.304
in his entire life.Diego Garcia.

36:11.347 --> 36:13.478
Exactly! Which means
that whoever

36:13.521 --> 36:16.130
was in close contact with Bick--
and when I say "close," I mean

36:16.173 --> 36:17.913
like close enough to,

36:17.956 --> 36:22.000
say, drown him and cut him open,
transferring the pollen spores--

36:22.043 --> 36:23.000
that's your killer.

the Diego Garcia Air Force Base.

What's that right there?

36:36.695 --> 36:38.521

36:40.434 --> 36:42.521
It's a level-three
security facility.

36:42.565 --> 36:44.130
It's not on
the basic map directory.

36:44.173 --> 36:45.478
Well, then make it
un-basic, McGee.

36:49.695 --> 36:53.565
Who is the most recent
station chief there?

36:53.608 --> 36:56.826
Well, boss, that would require
me hacking into...

36:59.000 --> 37:01.260
Do it, Agent McGee.

37:05.304 --> 37:06.608
Well, I'll be damned.

37:08.304 --> 37:10.304
Time to go above
her head, Leon.Happy to.

37:12.652 --> 37:14.347
[typing]

37:17.000 --> 37:18.826
McGee?

37:18.869 --> 37:21.043
CIA's preparing to activate
their cash-tracking software.

37:21.086 --> 37:22.782
This'll show us exactly where

37:22.826 --> 37:24.782
the marked money can be found
at this very moment.

37:27.956 --> 37:29.521
She's hiding it
all over town.

37:29.565 --> 37:31.739
No, it's not hidden.
It's spent. McGee...

37:31.782 --> 37:34.565
[typing]

37:34.608 --> 37:37.173
You're right, boss.
Looks like the money has been

37:37.217 --> 37:38.869
spent at vendors
all over the city.

37:38.913 --> 37:40.652
How'd she do it?
She didn't.

37:40.695 --> 37:42.000
The Royal Navy did.

37:42.043 --> 37:44.391
Got the manifest for
the Sparrow-Hawk?

37:46.521 --> 37:49.478
McGEE: Over a million in cash
was on the Sparrow-Hawk.

37:49.521 --> 37:51.521
Payroll while
they were at sea.

37:51.565 --> 37:54.565
They use U.S. dollars, since
they're accepted at every port.

37:54.608 --> 37:57.869
Sailors get paid, come into town
on leave...

37:57.913 --> 38:00.521
So, somebody switched out
the CIA's marked money

38:00.565 --> 38:03.608
with the Brits'
clean currency.
Laundering.

38:03.652 --> 38:06.260
Malloy had access. How do we
know he wasn't involved in it?

38:06.304 --> 38:08.565
We don't. Petty Officer Bick
must have figured it out.

38:08.608 --> 38:10.739
So she killed him.
She's still got

38:10.782 --> 38:12.869
additional currency to switch
out, too, so what's next?

38:12.913 --> 38:13.739
McGee, where's Tennison?

38:13.782 --> 38:16.130
Tennison...

38:20.782 --> 38:23.608
She just arranged for a Navy
helo to transport her

38:23.652 --> 38:24.521
to the USS Tripoli.

38:24.565 --> 38:25.826
Calls?

38:27.086 --> 38:28.347
Initiate cell search.

38:30.434 --> 38:33.347
All right,
multiple recent cell calls

38:33.391 --> 38:36.173
to a Lieutenant Malcolm Dufrain
on board.

38:36.217 --> 38:38.043
Works in the Tripoli's
disbursement office.

38:38.086 --> 38:39.304
Dufrain must be her new contact

38:39.347 --> 38:41.086
to switch out the
rest of the money.

38:41.130 --> 38:43.434
What's her ETA?

38:43.478 --> 38:46.304
Pulling up Tennison's
flight request.

38:46.347 --> 38:47.565
Right here's the time
of departure.

38:47.608 --> 38:49.000
Here's her arrival
on the ship.

38:49.043 --> 38:50.304
McGee.
You can beat it.

39:05.347 --> 39:07.217
[indistinct chatter]

39:15.913 --> 39:17.695
I got it.All right.

39:22.695 --> 39:24.913
Lieutenant Dufrain,

39:24.956 --> 39:26.130
sorry I'm late.

39:26.173 --> 39:28.000
Yes, now I assume

39:28.043 --> 39:30.739
you'll be wanting to exchange
this for smaller bills.

39:30.782 --> 39:33.130
What are you doing here?

39:33.173 --> 39:34.695
Give me the money, Tennison.

39:34.739 --> 39:35.913
Not so fast.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.565
An English pistol.

39:37.608 --> 39:39.956
You killed that Yank sailor,
didn't you?

39:40.000 --> 39:42.652
I killed him because he
saw what I was doing,

39:42.695 --> 39:44.217
and he tried to stop me.

39:44.260 --> 39:46.434
Don't make the same
mistake he did.

39:46.478 --> 39:48.695
I think you just made
the mistake.

39:48.739 --> 39:51.260
You're under arrest

39:51.304 --> 39:53.260
for the murder of
Petty Officer Edward Bick.

39:53.304 --> 39:56.739
A Webley.
Bet it matches our slug.

39:56.782 --> 40:00.956
The money was going to drug
smugglers and opium growers.

40:01.000 --> 40:05.260
You think it
actually matters
whose side we're on?

40:05.304 --> 40:08.043
It all ends up the same
in the end, anyway.

40:08.086 --> 40:12.260
Hell, I was probably saving
lives by keeping the money.

40:12.304 --> 40:14.478
You didn't save Bick's.

40:45.391 --> 40:46.652
Perhaps.

40:46.695 --> 40:49.391
Well, I like that there's

40:49.434 --> 40:52.086
someone out there
that makes you smile.

40:52.130 --> 40:54.956
[chuckling] Yes, there is.

40:55.000 --> 40:57.043
Yeah, maybe
I can meet him someday.

40:57.086 --> 40:59.913
Maybe... one day.

41:01.304 --> 41:03.434
Got a big date tonight?

41:03.478 --> 41:06.913
Um, no. I'm going home.

41:06.956 --> 41:09.695
Uh, Tony, I have a question.

41:09.739 --> 41:11.260
Shoot.

41:11.304 --> 41:12.782
If and when you
meet my friend--

41:12.826 --> 41:17.260
and I emphasize if--

41:17.304 --> 41:19.782
what will you say?

41:19.826 --> 41:21.782
"Be careful."

41:21.826 --> 41:23.304
[chuckles]

41:23.347 --> 41:25.043
Um...

41:25.086 --> 41:28.826
"Handle with care."

41:28.869 --> 41:31.043
"Contents priceless."

41:32.782 --> 41:34.826
Good night, Tony.

41:37.608 --> 41:39.869
Good night, Ziva.

41:39.913 --> 41:41.782
[grunts]
Gotta get my keys.

41:44.130 --> 41:46.000
[elevator bell dings]

41:55.913 --> 41:57.565
[alarms blaring]

41:57.608 --> 41:59.478
Aah!

41:59.521 --> 42:01.478
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh!

42:01.521 --> 42:03.782
Oh, come on...!
