00:14.750 --> 00:17.417
No, put Carlos in front,
you go in back!

00:17.583 --> 00:19.542
And talk to him,
get him to say something.

00:19.708 --> 00:21.333
Whatever it is, get him to talk.

00:21.500 --> 00:24.208
What do I say to him?
I don't know.

00:24.708 --> 00:25.542
Víctor.

00:25.708 --> 00:26.958
Whatever you want!

00:27.125 --> 00:29.208
Damn, he's a kid.

00:29.875 --> 00:34.292
Shut up and snap out of it!
Don't you go to sleep too!

00:35.417 --> 00:37.792
-Nothing will happen to him.
-Don't leave me alone!

00:37.958 --> 00:40.583
Don't take him to my place.
My mother can't see him!

00:40.750 --> 00:41.583
Fuck!

00:41.750 --> 00:44.250
Call Nora, she always knows
what to do.

00:44.417 --> 00:47.292
Carlos, wake up, wake up...
Fuck! Fuck!

00:47.458 --> 00:48.917
Nora, Nora.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.458
Fuck, Carlos!

00:54.917 --> 00:56.292
Talk to him!

00:57.208 --> 00:58.042
Víctor?

00:58.833 --> 01:00.958
Tell me. Víctor.

01:01.125 --> 01:03.792
Let's go to your house.
Take me to your house.

01:05.500 --> 01:07.542
Carlos, don't fall asleep.

01:08.792 --> 01:09.750
Wake up.

01:10.583 --> 01:12.083
Tell me anything. Whatever it is.

01:13.958 --> 01:15.167
You talk!

01:15.333 --> 01:16.750
No, you, please.

01:16.917 --> 01:19.042
-Talk to him!
-Víctor, you talk to him.

01:19.208 --> 01:22.083
Talk! Do something!
Snap out of it!

01:22.250 --> 01:23.292
I can't.

01:28.167 --> 01:29.833
Fuck, fuck!

01:31.583 --> 01:33.042
Do something!

01:45.250 --> 01:49.458
SANTA ANA UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

02:27.750 --> 02:28.958
Where's Abel?

02:29.125 --> 02:30.625
At my place.

02:31.500 --> 02:32.792
But he's...

02:45.208 --> 02:46.917
You're going to help me, Víctor.

02:50.417 --> 02:51.917
I can't do anything.

02:53.292 --> 02:54.542
If only I could.

02:56.542 --> 02:58.042
Yes, you can.

03:03.167 --> 03:07.667

SIX YEARS LATER

04:10.375 --> 04:13.083
THURSDAY

04:16.583 --> 04:17.875
Good morning.

04:18.042 --> 04:18.917
Good morning.

04:25.125 --> 04:27.542
<i>Political corruption</i>
<i>has marked the days prior to</i>

04:27.708 --> 04:29.708
<i>a historic investiture session.</i>

04:30.000 --> 04:32.958
<i>The People United candidate,</i>
<i>Abel Ruiz,</i>

04:33.125 --> 04:35.458
<i>states that he will fulfil</i>
<i>his campaign promise</i>

04:35.625 --> 04:38.708
<i>and that his first goal at the head</i>
<i>of the Andalusian Government</i>

04:38.875 --> 04:41.083
<i>will be to put an end</i>
<i>to political corruption.</i>

04:41.750 --> 04:44.333
<i>Ruiz does not want the return</i>
<i>of the scandals</i>

04:44.500 --> 04:47.667
<i>like those of the top advisor</i>
<i>of the ex-government of Andalusia,</i>

04:47.833 --> 04:49.375
<i>Gonzalo Alarcón, in prison...</i>

04:49.542 --> 04:50.708
-Can you stop for a moment, please?
-Here?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.458
Yes. Just for a moment.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.000
<i>...and diverting public funds</i>
<i>to a "B account".</i>

04:57.542 --> 04:59.292
<i>All this indicates that</i>
<i>there will be no surprises</i>

04:59.458 --> 05:02.667
<i>and the foreseen scenario</i>
<i>will see Abel Ruiz named</i>

05:02.833 --> 05:04.958
<i>as the new Andalusian president</i>
<i>in four days,</i>

05:05.125 --> 05:07.958
<i>thus breaking the traditional</i>
<i>two-party system.</i>

05:08.125 --> 05:09.708
<i>Despite maximum support</i>
<i>in the ballot boxes,</i>

05:09.875 --> 05:13.042
<i>the opposition is on a war footing</i>
<i>due to Ruiz's controversial past.</i>

05:13.625 --> 05:17.542
<i>The People United candidate</i>
<i>has been surprisingly candid</i>

05:17.708 --> 05:19.292
<i>for our political class</i>

05:19.458 --> 05:22.292
<i>and has not hidden his struggle</i>
<i>against the ghosts of his past.</i>

05:22.458 --> 05:23.792
INCOMING CALL - UNKNOWN

05:23.958 --> 05:25.917
<i>Abel Ruiz once again shows</i>

05:26.083 --> 05:29.833
<i>his willingness to change</i>
<i>our country's tainted politics,</i>

05:30.000 --> 05:31.750
<i>working for all Andalusians...</i>

05:31.917 --> 05:33.458
Lady, I can't stay in
the middle of the road.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.125
-Do we go or stay?
-Yes, let's go.

05:36.292 --> 05:40.125
<i>...pledges to be transparent</i>
<i>and showing this commitment...</i>

06:29.917 --> 06:32.500
A CHANGE FOR ANDALUSIA

06:34.042 --> 06:37.458
PEOPLE UNITED
WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU

06:51.958 --> 06:54.417
Abel, I'm just saying that
this report is no joke.

06:54.583 --> 06:55.792
It's the first time

06:55.958 --> 06:57.167
that such a major medium,

06:57.333 --> 06:59.125
plus that fucking Sunday rag
that everyone reads,

06:59.292 --> 07:00.625
have recognized that this is history

07:00.792 --> 07:03.000
and doesn't treat us like
the idiot brother of the usual bunch.

07:03.167 --> 07:04.417
And on the cover, shit.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.000
I mean that it wouldn't be bad
if this weekend at your house

07:07.167 --> 07:09.583
there was someone trusted
with this photographer, just in case.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.958
Just in case?
In case of what?

07:12.125 --> 07:13.708
In case things deviate from the party

07:13.875 --> 07:15.375
and focus on things
that are nothing to do

07:15.542 --> 07:16.458
with what we've achieved.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.875
And that no one gives a shit about.
It's important...

07:19.042 --> 07:20.958
Everyone already knows
about all that, Martín.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.750
Abel, you've got better approval
than the Secretary General,

07:23.917 --> 07:25.542
and three years ago
we didn't even exist.

07:25.708 --> 07:26.958
You were wasting away
at that university

07:27.125 --> 07:28.708
teaching some brats
how to do things,

07:28.875 --> 07:30.500
and now you're doing those things.

07:30.667 --> 07:32.042
I know this is just the start,

07:32.208 --> 07:33.458
but we have to get it right

07:33.625 --> 07:35.958
and this report is
a huge fucking opportunity.

07:39.042 --> 07:42.042
THE "NEW FACE" OF ANDALUSIA

07:42.208 --> 07:43.333
Gee, Martín,

07:43.500 --> 07:45.042
they did a good job today,

07:45.208 --> 07:46.625
we can't deny them that.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.292
Yes, I saw the photo this morning.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.292
I don't know where
the bastards got it.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.958
Fear makes them rummage
through the trash.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.250
What's this?

08:00.583 --> 08:02.125
I've been doing my job,

08:02.458 --> 08:03.708
trying to understand why

08:03.875 --> 08:05.583
you're so interested in
him doing the photos.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.667
And what do you think?

08:07.833 --> 08:09.375
About the photos or your interest?

08:11.417 --> 08:13.125
Félix is an old friend of mine,

08:13.292 --> 08:14.417
and of Nora's.

08:15.083 --> 08:16.292
From when?

08:17.583 --> 08:19.375
It's a good time for bad friends.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.542
Félix is different.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.042
One of the few decent people
in that period.

08:24.208 --> 08:27.750
The photos are good,
too good in my opinion.

08:27.917 --> 08:29.542
But they're good. He's good.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.333
What Félix wants will only
come about if we're alone.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.750
Plus, it was the deal with the paper.

08:37.542 --> 08:39.833
Two mutts that shared a doghouse

08:40.000 --> 08:41.667
that nobody had any hope for

08:41.833 --> 08:43.458
and who finally got out

08:43.625 --> 08:46.458
and made something happen
in the world, each in his own way.

08:46.625 --> 08:49.125
And they see each other again
to talk about it.

08:49.292 --> 08:50.958
The two of them alone.

08:55.458 --> 08:56.458
Here.

08:56.625 --> 08:57.625
No, you keep it.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.542
I just wanted to take a look.

09:00.125 --> 09:03.375
And you should look for
an apartment downtown

09:03.542 --> 09:05.375
to make life easy for everyone.

09:05.542 --> 09:06.375
Yes.

09:06.542 --> 09:08.958
Anyway, I can always sleep
on your sofa, right?

09:09.125 --> 09:10.542
If Tino lets you, it's fine by me.

09:10.708 --> 09:12.542
-Your cat is a son of a bitch.
-He sure is.

09:12.708 --> 09:14.250
-He hates me.
-He hates you.

09:14.417 --> 09:16.958
Good, that way you're ready
for what's coming at you on Monday.

09:17.125 --> 09:18.792
Bastard. Go fuck yourself.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.375
Right. See you later.

09:23.125 --> 09:24.542
Blondie.

09:29.042 --> 09:30.417
Hi.

09:36.125 --> 09:37.417
You taste bitter.

09:37.583 --> 09:38.958
The coffee.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.917
Go on, help me.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.542
I got my dad's old room
ready for Félix.

09:47.708 --> 09:50.125
This heat's crazy and the sun
doesn't hit it until the afternoon.

09:50.292 --> 09:51.125
He'll be better.

09:51.292 --> 09:54.375
-I really want to see him.
-Me too. It's been so long...

09:56.333 --> 09:58.958
I left the building plans
for the bedrooms on your desk.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.667
You have to tell me
if you want parquet

10:00.833 --> 10:02.333
or if we leave the tiles
as they are.

10:02.500 --> 10:04.667
Up to you, Nora.
Whatever you say is fine.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.083
I prefer to keep the tiles

10:07.250 --> 10:09.042
and give them a good acid bath,

10:09.208 --> 10:10.375
so the house doesn't look
so strange to me.

10:10.542 --> 10:12.042
That's just fine.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.667
Do you know who came
this morning asking for you?

10:17.833 --> 10:18.750
You'd just gone.

10:19.417 --> 10:21.750
Virginia... Illescas, is that her name?

10:21.917 --> 10:23.667
Dark hair, always went with you
to El General.

10:23.833 --> 10:25.125
She was an actress, right?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.167
Yes, and what did she want?

10:27.333 --> 10:30.000
She was visiting Seville
and wanted to say hi to you.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.083
I'll call her later and see
if I can catch her.

10:35.667 --> 10:36.792
Are you alright?

10:40.208 --> 10:43.833
Yes, just a bit spaced out
from this humidity.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.458
If you don't want to, don't call her.
Do what you like.

10:48.917 --> 10:51.625
No, it's not that.
I'll see later.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.458
She said she wanted to go
take a look at El General.

11:02.917 --> 11:04.458
You didn't tell her it'd closed?

11:04.625 --> 11:06.792
Yes, I told her that since
they opened the new freeway

11:06.958 --> 11:08.042
there's nothing there.

11:08.208 --> 11:11.000
She then said "congratulations"
and left.

11:11.792 --> 11:13.542
A real weirdo.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.167
I'm going to lie down
upstairs for a while.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.250
You eat and tell me
when Félix arrives, okay?

11:18.417 --> 11:20.083
-I'll tell you.
-Okay.

11:21.750 --> 11:24.000
I went to Rosa's this morning

11:24.167 --> 11:25.917
and bought some flowers
for your brother.

11:26.083 --> 11:28.042
I left them in your office.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.958
If I can I'll take them.

11:30.125 --> 11:31.083
Please...

11:31.250 --> 11:32.667
If I can I'll take them.

11:33.750 --> 11:35.125
I told Félix I'd devote

11:35.292 --> 11:36.833
the whole weekend
to him and his report.

11:37.000 --> 11:37.917
It's no joke, eh?

11:38.083 --> 11:39.208
At least call your parents

11:39.375 --> 11:40.958
and tell them
I forgot to buy them.

11:41.125 --> 11:43.250
Your mother's always saying
the niche never has any flowers,

11:43.417 --> 11:44.458
that they get stolen.

11:44.625 --> 11:45.750
I'll do it this evening.

11:46.792 --> 11:47.958
I promise.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.333
Go get some rest.

12:33.625 --> 12:35.208
What's up, ugly?

12:36.417 --> 12:37.708
How are you, handsome?

12:44.917 --> 12:45.750
It's luck.

12:45.917 --> 12:48.250
Remember the photo of the president
with the Nazi mustache?

12:48.542 --> 12:50.375
When I took the photo

12:50.542 --> 12:52.333
I didn't realize that just then

12:52.500 --> 12:55.167
something was making a shadow
there on his mustache.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.375
I was fascinated by
our president's cold sores,

12:58.542 --> 13:00.667
which were all gooey.

13:00.833 --> 13:02.167
Looked like a toad to me.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.833
-Gross.
-I was fascinated.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.250
So I clicked and, well,

13:05.417 --> 13:09.250
and I got a 50,000-euro prize
for an accidental Nazi shadow

13:09.417 --> 13:12.500
on the president's gob.
50,000 big ones.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.125
That photo was a hit everywhere.

13:14.292 --> 13:15.750
They even made T-shirts of it.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.750
That's hitting the top
in my profession. No shit.

13:17.917 --> 13:20.250
He's a lucky fucker,
I've always said it.

13:20.667 --> 13:21.917
Yes.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.458
Abel, not at the table.

13:28.625 --> 13:29.625
Just a moment.

13:33.958 --> 13:35.042
Abel.

13:36.250 --> 13:36.917
Sorry.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.458
It was Martín.

13:39.625 --> 13:42.250
We're to invite Alberto Gómez
and his wife to the party.

13:42.833 --> 13:45.042
You invite them if you like,
I don't know them at all.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.417
And it's a friends thing,
not a work thing.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.792
Now you have friends in that sewer?

13:49.958 --> 13:51.583
There are some left

13:51.750 --> 13:53.833
of all those sewer rats.

13:55.542 --> 13:59.333
You should start with that pearl
in Monday swearing-in speech.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.417
Yes, the media would love it.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.250
The media will love
whatever you say.

14:03.417 --> 14:04.792
Alright, alright...

14:07.458 --> 14:10.417
Besides, now they'll be
working for you, right?

14:10.583 --> 14:11.417
Who?

14:11.583 --> 14:14.292
Your friend, Víctor Alarcón.

14:17.042 --> 14:18.583
"Don't know, no answer".

14:18.750 --> 14:20.875
Doesn't he still run the coven?

14:23.375 --> 14:25.458
-What's "the coven"?
-Nothing.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.208
Félix, what is it?

14:27.750 --> 14:30.708
The private hunting estate
of the Alarcón family.

14:30.875 --> 14:32.417
Jeez...

14:35.250 --> 14:38.625
It's the Board of Public TV and Radio.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.083
Anyway,

14:43.333 --> 14:46.750
Víctor's still there,
where his dad put him, right?

14:46.917 --> 14:48.917
But now he's at
the service of the good guys.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.042
"Don't know, no answer".

14:51.958 --> 14:53.125
Alright.

16:10.292 --> 16:13.000
THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV
DOSTOYEVSKY

17:05.333 --> 17:06.667
FRIDAY

17:06.833 --> 17:09.292
Why did you devote yourself
to politics?

17:11.208 --> 17:14.875
My mother served
in the Alarcón family house

17:15.042 --> 17:16.958
for over thirty years.

17:17.917 --> 17:18.917
In precisely the last year,

17:19.083 --> 17:21.833
Gonzalo Alarcón was advisor
to the Junta.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.500
She didn't tell me,

17:24.667 --> 17:28.000
but she'd watch the TV
in the living room

17:28.167 --> 17:30.625
from a wicker chair in the kitchen.

17:31.542 --> 17:33.583
When she was in the Alarcón
family house, I mean.

17:33.750 --> 17:35.958
We didn't even have a TV.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.625
She'd take the chair to the door

17:41.625 --> 17:44.000
and watch the TV from a distance

17:44.167 --> 17:46.833
while she did what she had to do.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.583
That was how she saw
Massiel win Eurovision,

17:52.250 --> 17:55.833
sitting in a wicker chair,
folding clothes.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.167
She loved Massiel.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.583
I only saw her like that once.

18:05.917 --> 18:08.292
One night I had to stay with her.

18:09.292 --> 18:12.042
She didn't even look at me,

18:12.208 --> 18:14.833
out of shame I imagine,

18:15.417 --> 18:17.167
or dignity.

18:17.958 --> 18:19.792
My father always told me

18:19.958 --> 18:21.583
that shame and dignity

18:21.750 --> 18:23.708
are two problems of
houses with no money.

18:28.708 --> 18:29.833
Well, that night,

18:30.750 --> 18:33.042
my mother sat me on her knees

18:36.750 --> 18:38.833
and we both stayed there,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.708
in the kitchen,

18:40.875 --> 18:42.292
in silence,

18:43.167 --> 18:45.458
watching the TV yards away.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.000
I remember that Mayra's
"One, Two, Three" was on.

18:50.833 --> 18:53.167
That's why I devote myself
to politics,

18:54.042 --> 18:56.708
for the people who have to sit
in those chairs.

19:24.417 --> 19:26.708
FOR SALE

19:39.917 --> 19:41.500
Wait, please. I won't be long.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.583
The meter's still on.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.375
It doesn't matter.
Wait for me.

19:45.542 --> 19:46.917
-Thanks.
-Alright.

20:12.458 --> 20:13.667
Shit.

21:11.125 --> 21:12.458
Hello.

21:13.292 --> 21:15.667
Víctor, can we do this
some other time?

21:15.833 --> 21:17.250
Impossible. I'm sorry.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.042
Please.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.625
What's wrong?

21:20.958 --> 21:21.917
Nothing.

21:23.458 --> 21:24.708
Did you come with someone?

21:25.042 --> 21:26.583
No, in a taxi, as usual.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.750
What's that car?
It looks familiar.

21:28.917 --> 21:30.542
Abandoned, like everything here.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.250
Here.

21:38.375 --> 21:39.833
Thanks.

21:42.875 --> 21:44.625
Would you mind...?

21:44.792 --> 21:46.250
You want the receipt?

21:49.708 --> 21:51.042
I have to ask you something, Nora.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.625
It's important.

21:52.792 --> 21:54.917
I have to go, Víctor.
Give it to me, please.

21:55.083 --> 21:56.917
It'll just be a moment.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.583
We'll get into the car if you like.

21:59.750 --> 22:01.542
I just need to tell you something,

22:01.708 --> 22:03.417
then you can go with your receipt.

22:27.250 --> 22:29.417
I haven't had much time lately
to clean it.

22:29.583 --> 22:30.542
I don't care.

22:31.000 --> 22:32.250
No.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.750
You do.

22:33.917 --> 22:36.375
You won't even put
your back on the seat.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.583
What do you think is in there?

22:38.750 --> 22:40.042
Bedbugs?

22:50.375 --> 22:54.000
Do you know it was Abel who
brought me here the first time?

22:56.542 --> 22:59.000
"We're going get hooked
on this place", he said.

23:00.042 --> 23:01.667
He dragged me

23:02.333 --> 23:04.292
and stayed up for almost two days,

23:04.458 --> 23:06.583
not leaving the bar,
not knowing what time it was.

23:10.500 --> 23:13.083
We had a great time here.
Pity the party always ends.

23:15.792 --> 23:18.083
But you were the friend
of the son in the family.

23:18.250 --> 23:19.667
Víctor and I were kids

23:19.833 --> 23:21.917
when my mother served
at the house of his family.

23:23.042 --> 23:26.000
I suppose making friends
was inevitable.

23:29.875 --> 23:32.375
The house could get very lonely.

23:35.958 --> 23:37.750
Let's carry on later, okay?

23:37.917 --> 23:39.625
-Are you alright?
-Yeah, yeah.

23:39.792 --> 23:42.625
All these photos in a row,
I'm not used to it.

23:43.625 --> 23:45.333
Do that outside.

23:56.042 --> 23:57.542
Give me a puff, go on.

23:58.792 --> 23:59.625
Are you sure?

23:59.792 --> 24:00.708
Give it here.

24:00.875 --> 24:03.750
You won't get hooked again
and ruin your Jesus Christ image?

24:03.917 --> 24:05.167
Fuck off.

24:11.500 --> 24:13.417
I missed it, eh?

24:14.292 --> 24:17.042
I even miss a good hangover.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.375
They're still an option.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.042
I imagine so.

24:29.917 --> 24:31.792
Aren't you...

24:31.958 --> 24:33.292
I don't know...

24:33.583 --> 24:37.042
scared that this whole thing
will take its toll somehow?

24:39.125 --> 24:40.250
No.

24:57.792 --> 24:59.625
It's all here. Thanks.

24:59.792 --> 25:00.958
Give me the receipt, please.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.875
The taxi's waiting
and it'll be a fortune.

25:03.292 --> 25:04.917
Don't worry about that.

25:05.250 --> 25:06.792
I'll pay for your taxi.

25:07.042 --> 25:09.292
For the bother of coming here
so many years.

25:13.958 --> 25:15.375
What's wrong?

25:15.542 --> 25:16.792
Isn't it enough?

25:16.958 --> 25:18.292
I don't want your money.

25:19.208 --> 25:21.083
This is new.

25:23.292 --> 25:25.917
It's the same money
that saved Abel.

25:26.708 --> 25:28.542
Take it, woman.

25:28.708 --> 25:29.833
It's nice that...

25:30.000 --> 25:32.125
you only need it now for a taxi.

25:32.292 --> 25:33.917
You keep it, you need it.

25:35.792 --> 25:37.083
Give me the receipt.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.750
It just occurred to me

25:44.917 --> 25:46.958
that you should send
my father a present...

25:47.125 --> 25:48.333
in prison.

25:48.500 --> 25:51.042
Something to cheer him up,
put him in a good mood.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.875
He's having a shit time inside,
you know?

25:57.792 --> 25:59.875
That's what you should do.

26:00.042 --> 26:02.292
And put a proper end
to your debt.

26:03.958 --> 26:07.125
You have to be grateful and good
to the people who help you, Nora.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.958
I'm even with you and with him.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.333
Give me the receipt.
It's fair and...

26:25.458 --> 26:26.875
I'm sorry.

26:27.042 --> 26:28.500
I'm sorry.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.625
Lying son of a bitch.

26:33.917 --> 26:35.083
Don't do this to me, Víctor.

26:35.250 --> 26:36.875
Do what?

26:37.042 --> 26:38.875
Don't humiliate me
in front of Abel.

26:39.542 --> 26:41.292
It won't happen if you help me.

26:41.458 --> 26:42.958
And you're going to.

26:45.708 --> 26:47.042
What do you want?

26:48.250 --> 26:51.667
If Abel kicks me out, I'll squeal
and it's goodbye to his career.

27:20.625 --> 27:21.792
I'm sorry, Nora.

27:21.958 --> 27:23.833
Shut up, you're incapable
of feeling anything!

27:24.000 --> 27:25.792
I asked for that money!
He didn't know!

27:25.958 --> 27:27.667
-I was the one that...
-That what?

27:28.292 --> 27:31.042
You didn't ask too much in case
the truth hit you in the face!

27:31.208 --> 27:33.500
I didn't know! Fuck!
I didn't know!

27:33.667 --> 27:34.708
That's the truth!

27:34.875 --> 27:36.958
A truth nobody will give
a fuck about.

27:50.375 --> 27:52.208
Call me when you do it.

27:52.875 --> 27:55.375
Or write if you don't want
to talk, I'll understand.

27:55.542 --> 27:57.708
But if I don't find out
by Sunday morning,

27:57.875 --> 28:00.042
I'll take it for granted that Abel
is sticking to his decision.

28:00.208 --> 28:02.000
Then I'll take mine.

28:02.333 --> 28:04.208
It depends on you and on him.

28:05.042 --> 28:06.292
I'm sorry.

28:34.542 --> 28:35.625
Nora?

28:46.417 --> 28:48.375
Are you alright?

28:50.167 --> 28:51.417
Are you alright?

29:01.625 --> 29:03.083
What are you doing here?

29:03.250 --> 29:05.833
I was on my way home

29:06.000 --> 29:08.583
and I suddenly saw your car
from the road.

29:08.750 --> 29:11.125
I recognized it and asked
the taxi driver to stop.

29:11.458 --> 29:13.958
I was in the area,
just passing through.

29:15.083 --> 29:17.042
I called yesterday to warn you.

29:18.042 --> 29:20.208
I know, I know.

29:20.375 --> 29:22.708
That's why I stopped
when I saw your car.

29:32.542 --> 29:34.875
Take me home
and tell me about it.

29:35.042 --> 29:36.167
Sure.

29:36.958 --> 29:40.542
Look, Nora gave me that
when we got back from Barcelona

29:41.042 --> 29:43.042
with what little was left over
from her old man's bequest.

29:43.208 --> 29:46.875
The rest she spent paying for
all the time I was in that clinic.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.542
She paid for it all.

29:48.708 --> 29:49.792
All of it.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.667
Every one of figures living there

29:51.833 --> 29:54.042
symbolizes a year further away
from the shit.

29:54.208 --> 29:56.042
And the lies.

29:59.708 --> 30:01.125
People get cured.

30:02.250 --> 30:04.167
Then they can cure others.

30:05.042 --> 30:07.125
Even in my shitty profession.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.583
That's why I'm not scared.

30:12.292 --> 30:14.792
I read in the press that
Víctor's dad lives in prison

30:14.958 --> 30:16.250
like some god.

30:16.417 --> 30:17.292
Well...

30:17.458 --> 30:19.208
He's even got a flat-screen TV
in his cell.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.917
Don't act innocent,
it doesn't suit you.

30:23.083 --> 30:26.042
They don't make life easy
for anyone in those places,

30:26.208 --> 30:27.667
much less someone like him.

30:28.625 --> 30:31.375
In fact, I know that
they've given him the odd scare.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.042
It works when it wants to.

30:38.000 --> 30:39.417
It's alright.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.667
Feeling better?

30:45.833 --> 30:47.917
Yes, it was just a dizzy spell.

30:50.875 --> 30:53.167
My mouth tastes awful.
Have you got any mints?

30:53.333 --> 30:54.708
You always had them, right?

31:03.167 --> 31:05.792
This car's full of trash.
Sorry, eh?

31:34.333 --> 31:36.875
I'm sorry for not
returning your call.

31:38.958 --> 31:40.833
Lots of people
have been calling lately

31:41.000 --> 31:42.417
who hadn't called for ages.

31:43.042 --> 31:46.042
Relax, I figured that you
didn't know who called.

31:46.208 --> 31:48.833
They cut my line,
I changed my phone number and...

31:49.458 --> 31:50.667
Sure.

31:59.625 --> 32:00.917
You look good.

32:04.875 --> 32:06.583
I look horrible.

32:09.167 --> 32:11.708
I'm fucked up, eh?

32:26.417 --> 32:28.375
You do look good,

32:29.167 --> 32:30.958
you look like a different woman.

32:32.292 --> 32:34.083
Both of us.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.167
Both of us are doing just great.

32:42.375 --> 32:43.208
See?

32:43.375 --> 32:45.833
One bang and it works,
like all old stuff.

32:53.083 --> 32:57.250
Do you have somewhere to stay
while you're passing through?

33:23.750 --> 33:27.500
I LOVE YOU - VÍCTOR

33:38.167 --> 33:39.458
Come in.

33:40.167 --> 33:41.583
No?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.208
What?

34:33.125 --> 34:35.000
Has your friend Virginia settled in?

34:36.208 --> 34:37.958
She's on it.

34:40.125 --> 34:42.375
Just as well you didn't
want to see her.

34:42.875 --> 34:44.167
It wasn't that.
I was embarrassed about

34:44.333 --> 34:47.292
forgetting she existed all this time.

34:47.458 --> 34:48.833
Right.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.958
So you pick her up
like an injured animal, eh?

34:53.875 --> 34:55.083
It'll only be a couple of days.

34:55.250 --> 34:56.125
Besides, it'll do me good

34:56.292 --> 34:57.875
to have someone help me
with Sunday's thing,

34:58.042 --> 35:00.667
it's a lot of hassle for me alone.
The food, the flowers...

35:00.833 --> 35:02.208
But has she come to stay?

35:03.042 --> 35:04.667
I don't know, maybe.

35:08.750 --> 35:10.458
She was looking after her mother,
but I think she died,

35:10.625 --> 35:11.875
even though she hasn't said anything.

35:12.042 --> 35:13.875
She's so weird...

35:14.042 --> 35:16.542
No. She's doesn't like
talking much, that's all.

35:16.708 --> 35:17.917
She is weird.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.792
-You're the weird one.
-Me?

35:32.500 --> 35:34.375
I saw Víctor today.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.500
Where?

35:42.917 --> 35:46.625
He was walking down the street.
I was in a taxi. He didn't see me.

35:46.958 --> 35:50.125
I don't like you taking a taxi every day,
as if we were millionaires.

35:50.292 --> 35:52.500
We have to present a good image,
especially now.

35:52.667 --> 35:55.375
And you've got the bus stop,
15 minutes away?

35:55.542 --> 35:58.458
He looked a wreck,
like someone else, so thin...

35:59.792 --> 36:00.917
Yeah?

36:03.167 --> 36:05.292
Is it true what Félix said?

36:05.458 --> 36:08.500
Will he be in your service now
or will you fire him?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.208
I don't want to talk about that.

36:10.375 --> 36:11.833
But they say he's great at his job.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.875
-Great, huh?
-That's enough.

36:14.042 --> 36:15.792
Okay?

36:27.292 --> 36:30.208
Abel, you're different from the others,
you believe in people.

36:30.375 --> 36:31.458
Not in that kind of people.

36:31.625 --> 36:32.833
Maybe you should show it

36:33.000 --> 36:35.333
by giving him a chance to change
than by kicking him out.

36:35.500 --> 36:36.583
What's all this about now?

36:36.750 --> 36:38.958
Nothing.
I saw him looking so bad...

36:39.125 --> 36:41.375
Maybe he's sorry and needs you.

36:41.542 --> 36:42.625
He needs me?

36:42.792 --> 36:44.833
Or needs your help.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.250
Sure, like he helped my brother, eh?

36:49.042 --> 36:50.875
Was he here?

36:52.333 --> 36:53.750
Was he here and asked you
to speak to me?

36:53.917 --> 36:55.042
Did he dare to do that, the fucker?

36:55.208 --> 36:57.417
-Don't talk rubbish, please.
-I'm not talking rubbish.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.000
Answer me.

36:59.167 --> 37:00.208
Look at me.

37:00.375 --> 37:03.042
You look at me. He wasn't here
and he didn't ask me for anything.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.625
I feel sorry for him, that's all.

37:04.792 --> 37:05.708
-You feel sorry for him.
-Yes.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.458
Like your friend? You feel sorry
for her and bring her home.

37:09.542 --> 37:10.708
And what do we do with Víctor?

37:11.167 --> 37:13.458
Do we whitewash everything
he and his family did?

37:13.625 --> 37:15.042
Because we feel sorry for them
and embarrassed?

37:15.208 --> 37:16.042
It was his father!

37:16.208 --> 37:18.708
His father put him there,
doing what the fuck he liked.

37:19.292 --> 37:20.917
Sure, now he's a good guy.

37:21.083 --> 37:21.958
Hard knocks taught him that.

37:22.125 --> 37:25.167
If Víctor's ruined paying off
what his father stole,

37:25.333 --> 37:27.208
at least he's not using
the people's money.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.542
Don't be naïve.
Víctor isn't sorry.

37:31.708 --> 37:34.625
He's furious because he knows
they're taking his bone away.

37:38.958 --> 37:40.750
You're not involved in this.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.708
You're doing great.

37:45.417 --> 37:47.625
Really, I'm proud of you.

38:50.875 --> 38:53.708
SATURDAY

39:13.042 --> 39:15.292
THIEVES

39:15.458 --> 39:19.083
SON OF A BITCH

39:27.500 --> 39:29.875
SON OF A BITCH

40:16.750 --> 40:18.458
It died three days ago.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.375
My mother thinks it flew off
and will be back when it's hungry.

40:23.542 --> 40:24.958
This way she handles it better.

40:26.292 --> 40:29.167
I think I threw it in the trash
and forgot about it.

40:30.375 --> 40:31.375
Do you smell funny?

40:33.667 --> 40:35.833
I don't know, the usual.

40:37.417 --> 40:38.708
Wait there.

40:52.750 --> 40:54.250
Good morning.

40:54.542 --> 40:55.542
Who was it?

40:57.000 --> 40:58.375
Nobody.

41:03.833 --> 41:05.250
I liked it better before.

41:05.417 --> 41:06.542
What?

41:06.708 --> 41:08.042
Your hair.

41:08.958 --> 41:11.042
When it was short and people
thought you were a lesbian.

41:13.750 --> 41:16.125
Shit. I forgot that you hate coffee.

41:16.667 --> 41:17.792
Do you want some tea?

41:17.958 --> 41:20.042
I think I've got some.
Or chamomile?

41:21.167 --> 41:22.792
Whatever you want,
it doesn't matter.

41:22.958 --> 41:24.917
I'm asking you,
tea or chamomile?

41:25.083 --> 41:26.792
Whatever you want, Víctor.

41:47.875 --> 41:49.208
It's a quarter after nine.

41:49.375 --> 41:50.750
Right.

41:55.875 --> 41:57.292
This is what I want.

42:02.458 --> 42:03.875
Something we both like.

42:09.083 --> 42:12.125
You won't make me drink alone?
You owe me.

42:12.292 --> 42:13.417
What do I owe you?

42:13.583 --> 42:14.667
A toast.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.333
To the reunion.

42:28.583 --> 42:30.083
Why don't you throw it out?

42:30.375 --> 42:31.375
What?

42:41.458 --> 42:42.833
I'll water it later.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.667
Don't bother. It's dead.

42:44.833 --> 42:46.542
It's bad luck.

42:47.833 --> 42:50.458
If it's bad luck, I'm sure
it's the cause of everything.

42:52.458 --> 42:53.667
Are you here for breakfast, Virginia?

42:56.250 --> 42:58.208
I just wanted to see how you were.

42:58.542 --> 43:00.042
Okay.

43:00.667 --> 43:02.750
So you've come
to clear your conscience?

43:03.667 --> 43:06.917
That's hard for me to swallow,
you and I aren't like that.

43:13.667 --> 43:15.625
What are you and Nora up to?

43:17.375 --> 43:20.458
See? See how easy it is
to tell the truth?

43:20.625 --> 43:22.250
Don't you feel a lot better?

43:26.875 --> 43:28.875
It rang a bell,
that car at El General.

43:30.250 --> 43:31.792
What were you doing there?

43:32.792 --> 43:34.083
What do you want, Virginia?

43:35.125 --> 43:36.042
I don't know.

43:36.208 --> 43:37.250
-Do you know Nora's been here?
-No.

43:37.417 --> 43:39.292
But she's scared, I know that.

43:40.167 --> 43:41.875
You must be desperate
to smell fear on someone.

43:42.042 --> 43:43.458
-What did you see?
-You tell me.

43:43.625 --> 43:45.208
No, you tell me,
you're sitting right there,

43:45.375 --> 43:47.208
five years after disappearing
without a word.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.875
Tell me what you want.

43:49.250 --> 43:50.625
Is she cheating on Abel?

43:52.542 --> 43:53.875
You want money.

43:56.292 --> 43:58.292
Then ask Nora, not me.

43:58.458 --> 43:59.625
She's much smarter.

43:59.792 --> 44:01.542
She knows when to shut up.

44:01.708 --> 44:04.125
Get your money from at
the good guys' place, not here.

44:04.292 --> 44:06.458
There's only useless stuff here.

44:06.625 --> 44:08.458
Stuff nobody cares about.

44:24.208 --> 44:25.708
Just a little.

44:25.875 --> 44:28.083
So you warm up your stomach
and don't run off again,

44:28.250 --> 44:29.500
which is what you want to do.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.958
Víctor.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.875
Fuck, Mom!

44:40.500 --> 44:42.208
I dreamt about your father.

44:42.542 --> 44:44.208
Let me.

44:44.375 --> 44:45.667
What are you doing?

44:45.833 --> 44:46.958
Who are you?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.333
Nobody.

45:04.708 --> 45:07.375
She almost never does
anything like this, I'm sorry.

45:13.042 --> 45:15.292
Leave it, I'll do it,
you've done enough.

45:15.458 --> 45:16.708
I'm used to it.

45:18.375 --> 45:20.333
This is a job for daughters.

45:20.500 --> 45:22.208
What daughters leave behind,

45:22.375 --> 45:25.750
nobody gives a shit about, right?

45:35.458 --> 45:36.792
Is it too hot?

46:00.708 --> 46:01.958
Come on, Mom.

46:10.542 --> 46:12.208
Got a cigarette?

46:15.708 --> 46:17.208
Keep it.

46:19.833 --> 46:21.375
Virginia,

46:21.542 --> 46:23.375
what were you doing at El General?

46:27.500 --> 46:29.417
I drove there without thinking.

46:29.583 --> 46:32.583
It's the last place where
I had nice memories.

47:00.375 --> 47:03.375
<i>I think we should lend support</i>
<i>to People United.</i>

47:03.542 --> 47:06.792
<i>To what will happen from Monday</i>
<i>because Abel Ruiz and his group</i>

47:06.958 --> 47:09.583
<i>have shown that another form</i>
<i>of politics is possible</i>

47:09.750 --> 47:11.917
<i>and that they're going to</i>
<i>clean out the corrupt.</i>

47:12.083 --> 47:15.500
<i>I'm going to love seeing</i>
<i>these opportunists exposed.</i>

47:15.667 --> 47:17.000
<i>There's Víctor Alarcón,</i>

47:17.167 --> 47:18.833
<i>clinging to a job</i>
<i>that was a gift to him</i>

47:19.000 --> 47:21.792
<i>on the Board of Public Radio and TV.</i>

47:21.958 --> 47:25.208
<i>And that after his father took</i>
<i>6 million in public money</i>

47:25.375 --> 47:27.542
<i>allocated for social services!</i>

47:27.708 --> 47:29.375
<i>What a scumbag.</i>

47:29.542 --> 47:31.417
<i>And his son charging for</i>
<i>turning up now and then</i>

47:31.583 --> 47:33.125
<i>at the Board and talking crap.</i>

47:33.292 --> 47:36.958
<i>I had to chance to interview</i>
<i>Abel Ruiz this week</i>

47:37.125 --> 47:41.292
<i>and he insists that he'll fulfil</i>
<i>all his promises one by one,</i>

47:41.458 --> 47:45.250
<i>including the immediate dismissal</i>
<i>of any person of responsibility</i>

47:45.417 --> 47:47.875
<i>linked to any corruption issue,</i>

47:48.042 --> 47:49.500
<i>that is his priority.</i>

47:49.667 --> 47:51.875
<i>Priorities change when</i>
<i>one begins to rule.</i>

47:52.708 --> 47:56.042
<i>Don't forget that Víctor Alarcón</i>
<i>and Abel Ruiz were friends.</i>

47:56.375 --> 47:58.375
<i>So time will tell if</i>

47:58.542 --> 48:00.750
<i>in the end he's able to kick out</i>
<i>his drinking buddy.</i>

48:01.792 --> 48:03.625
-No.
-Yes.

48:04.458 --> 48:05.875
I found it.

48:06.042 --> 48:07.917
To play this Sunday at the party.

48:08.083 --> 48:10.458
He turned the house upside down
to find this. What is it?

48:11.500 --> 48:15.542
173 songs in the car
from the Barcelona clinic to here.

48:18.750 --> 48:20.917
You remember?

48:23.583 --> 48:24.917
You're tacky.

48:30.917 --> 48:32.208
No, no...

48:32.375 --> 48:33.583
Stop it.

48:42.875 --> 48:45.250
Put down the fucking camera,
this isn't part of the report.

48:45.417 --> 48:46.542
This is real life.

48:49.000 --> 48:50.417
No, no. Not here.

49:00.333 --> 49:01.625
What happened?

49:02.625 --> 49:05.458
Nothing, it's nothing.

49:06.625 --> 49:08.000
Abel...

49:09.667 --> 49:11.375
I'm pregnant.

49:11.708 --> 49:13.125
What?

49:13.750 --> 49:15.625
Seriously.
I didn't want to tell you

49:15.792 --> 49:17.792
until I was sure it was all
going to be alright.

49:17.958 --> 49:19.458
You're really pregnant?

49:31.792 --> 49:34.583
This is more important than
anything else now, Abel.

49:34.750 --> 49:36.083
-More than anything.
-Of course.

49:37.125 --> 49:39.667
If I can ask you a favor, please...

49:39.833 --> 49:42.292
I don't want to squirm
every time the phone rings,

49:42.458 --> 49:45.292
thinking that something bad
might happen to you.

49:45.458 --> 49:48.167
I don't want to go through that now,
not with this inside me.

49:48.333 --> 49:49.625
I won't let anything happen.

49:49.792 --> 49:52.250
-Anything can happen.
-What do you want me to do?

49:54.125 --> 49:57.542
Don't let Víctor lose his job,
please, don't replace him.

49:57.708 --> 49:58.875
Trust me.

49:59.042 --> 50:00.875
What is it with you and Víctor?

50:01.042 --> 50:03.292
Nothing. I'm doing it for you.

50:03.458 --> 50:06.458
Kicking him out won't make you
forget what happened that night.

50:06.625 --> 50:08.458
On the contrary,
it'll stay there, simmering.

50:09.375 --> 50:11.708
You have no idea
what happened that night.

50:11.875 --> 50:13.292
You don't know.

50:15.875 --> 50:18.625
I know that you can't look
your parents in the eye.

50:18.792 --> 50:22.333
Or go to a niche to lay
the flowers I give you.

50:22.500 --> 50:25.458
And I don't want Víctor
to use that to hurt you.

50:26.542 --> 50:29.083
You think that's why
I want to kick him out?

50:29.750 --> 50:31.458
Because I feel guilty?

50:31.625 --> 50:33.000
No, I only...

50:33.167 --> 50:36.083
I want to so that I have
something to be proud of.

50:36.250 --> 50:37.792
Proud of what?

50:37.958 --> 50:39.250
Proud of not being afraid
of these scum

50:39.417 --> 50:41.292
who think they can buy
everything with money.

50:48.167 --> 50:50.042
Give me that.

50:57.375 --> 50:59.042
<i>Víctor, I need more time.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

50:59.208 --> 51:01.958
<i>I can't. I need to know</i>
<i>by tomorrow morning... I'm sorry.</i>

51:12.000 --> 51:13.875
CALLING... VÍCTOR

52:09.917 --> 52:11.250
It looks good.

52:12.750 --> 52:14.000
Your hair.

52:15.667 --> 52:17.708
It's hot. It's better like this.

52:18.333 --> 52:20.000
May I take some photos?

52:20.167 --> 52:22.083
-Of me?
-Yes.

52:26.792 --> 52:28.750
Where do I figure in your report?

52:28.917 --> 52:30.125
No, it wouldn't be for the report.

52:30.292 --> 52:31.417
It'd be for me.

52:31.583 --> 52:33.708
I like looking at faces
that say things.

52:34.250 --> 52:36.458
No, mine doesn't say anything.

52:36.625 --> 52:37.500
Yes, it does.

52:37.667 --> 52:40.167
-You have your story there.
-Yeah?

52:42.542 --> 52:44.000
And what story is that?

52:44.167 --> 52:46.833
I don't know, let me shoot you
and we'll find out.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.417
It could be good, eh?

52:48.583 --> 52:50.250
He knows a lot of people.

52:50.417 --> 52:52.292
Maybe someone will see you.

52:53.958 --> 52:55.750
Have you had a look at his book?

52:55.917 --> 52:56.958
It's around here, isn't it?

52:57.125 --> 52:58.875
Yes, I'll find it later.

52:59.042 --> 53:01.375
You were an actress, weren't you?

53:01.542 --> 53:02.958
I am.

53:03.125 --> 53:04.875
It could be a good opportunity.

53:05.042 --> 53:06.458
No.

53:07.750 --> 53:09.333
I'm sure it would be.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.750
Thanks for giving it to me.

53:12.083 --> 53:13.792
And it won't cost you a thing.

53:13.958 --> 53:16.708
He'd love to do you a favor, right?

53:16.875 --> 53:18.208
Sure.

53:18.375 --> 53:20.500
Then take the photos
whenever you like.

53:20.667 --> 53:22.500
-Thanks.
-No, thank you.

53:22.708 --> 53:25.708
For giving me this opportunity,
thank you.

53:29.458 --> 53:31.375
In fact, let's toast.

53:31.542 --> 53:33.917
To men who give women opportunities.

53:34.083 --> 53:35.458
-Go on.
-No, no, no.

53:35.625 --> 53:39.167
With water it's bad luck
and none of us here want that.

53:41.250 --> 53:43.417
Where have you got
something good to toast with?

53:43.583 --> 53:46.917
Your father kept the expensive wine
in the cabinet, right, Nora?

53:47.083 --> 53:48.542
Well, you must excuse me.

53:48.708 --> 53:50.375
I've never understood wines.

53:50.708 --> 53:52.708
I just know that
the expensive ones are good.

53:52.875 --> 53:54.208
Virginia, sit down.

53:54.792 --> 53:56.125
Why?

53:56.417 --> 53:57.458
Sit down!

54:03.833 --> 54:05.125
I'm sorry.

54:17.917 --> 54:20.250
I'm sorry. I'm... a moron.

54:23.167 --> 54:26.458
I just wanted us to toast

54:26.875 --> 54:29.875
to the wonderful men
who give women opportunities.

54:30.042 --> 54:31.083
We're going to do it.

54:31.250 --> 54:33.000
With water...

54:33.167 --> 54:34.625
and with balls.

54:34.792 --> 54:36.958
Luck doesn't exist, Virginia.

54:37.875 --> 54:40.833
Besides, we don't need it now, right?

54:44.917 --> 54:46.292
Cheers!

54:59.042 --> 55:00.875
-Nora.
-What?

55:01.250 --> 55:02.875
I'm sorry.

55:03.042 --> 55:04.792
I didn't want to upset anyone.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.708
Then what did you want?

55:08.583 --> 55:10.625
What the fuck did you want?

55:13.083 --> 55:16.083
From the road you couldn't see
my car at El General.

55:16.250 --> 55:17.458
Impossible.

55:17.625 --> 55:20.167
I made sure of that myself.

55:20.333 --> 55:22.250
I didn't want anyone
to see me sleeping there.

55:22.417 --> 55:23.875
I was ashamed.

55:24.792 --> 55:26.375
Then what are you doing here...

55:26.542 --> 55:28.750
if you saw us
and chose to hang back?

55:30.917 --> 55:33.583
I'm here because
you asked me to stay.

55:33.750 --> 55:36.583
Because you wanted my help
or you wanted me close

55:36.750 --> 55:38.708
to find out what I'd seen,
I don't know,

55:38.875 --> 55:41.583
but you asked me to stay.

55:49.542 --> 55:50.875
Here.

55:51.042 --> 55:53.375
Go outside. I'll be right out
to get some air.

56:29.250 --> 56:31.792
I owed Víctor money.

56:31.958 --> 56:33.833
That's why we were there.

56:40.708 --> 56:42.917
Help me with the table.

56:55.583 --> 56:57.667
I needed help
and Víctor needed

56:57.833 --> 56:59.833
to stop remorse from
driving him crazy.

57:01.042 --> 57:02.500
Do you remember Carlos?

57:03.250 --> 57:04.458
Yes.

57:05.667 --> 57:08.458
Abel's little brother,
they were always together.

57:08.625 --> 57:09.708
I can't place his face right now,

57:09.875 --> 57:11.917
but I do recall seeing him
in El General.

57:12.083 --> 57:13.167
He was always...

57:13.333 --> 57:16.708
Drunk. Say 'drunk',
hammered like Víctor and Abel.

57:16.958 --> 57:19.500
Following the example
of the older guys.

57:19.667 --> 57:21.000
The boy learned fast.

57:22.333 --> 57:25.250
The animals, there were nights
when they could barely speak.

57:30.375 --> 57:32.000
What happened to him?

57:32.167 --> 57:33.458
An overdose, right?

57:33.625 --> 57:36.375
That's what I was told,
that he died in the hospital.

57:36.792 --> 57:40.083
It depends on how you look at it,
but yes, he died in the hospital.

57:40.250 --> 57:43.250
At the door to Emergencies,
thrown out like a dog.

57:43.417 --> 57:46.292
Víctor and Abel left him there
and got away unseen.

57:47.292 --> 57:49.583
It wasn't their fault,
the kid was out of control,

57:49.833 --> 57:52.750
but they were scared
and left him there, alone.

57:53.000 --> 57:54.792
Víctor didn't want any scandal

57:54.958 --> 57:57.458
blemishing his father.
You see the irony there.

57:57.625 --> 57:58.917
And Abel...

57:59.250 --> 58:02.292
Abel was so wasted that
he didn't remember a thing.

58:03.417 --> 58:05.333
But Víctor did,

58:06.583 --> 58:08.625
he remembered everything.

58:08.792 --> 58:11.000
And it was driving him crazy.

58:11.667 --> 58:13.375
Then he came to see me.

58:25.000 --> 58:27.292
I took advantage of his conscience.

58:28.833 --> 58:30.458
I made him feel guilty

58:30.625 --> 58:32.917
so he'd give me enough money
to leave here and cure Abel,

58:33.083 --> 58:34.917
as long as it took.

58:35.250 --> 58:37.958
I admitted him to that clinic
in Barcelona he talked about,

58:38.125 --> 58:40.750
as if it were a trip
he was dying to take,

58:41.917 --> 58:46.167
but didn't dare because he didn't
have the balls or the money.

58:46.333 --> 58:48.458
I gave him both of those things.

58:54.000 --> 58:55.750
And now Víctor wants it all back.

58:59.417 --> 59:01.000
He already has it.

59:01.167 --> 59:03.250
All of it, down to
the last euro, I swear.

59:03.417 --> 59:06.458
I gave it back any way I could,
getting it from wherever I could.

59:06.625 --> 59:08.875
Some of my mother's jewels
are still left.

59:09.542 --> 59:11.417
And Abel never suspected a thing.

59:11.583 --> 59:13.083
He thinks I used an inheritance

59:13.250 --> 59:15.375
from my father that doesn't exist.

59:16.083 --> 59:18.583
He couldn't stand me
owing Víctor anything.

59:18.750 --> 59:20.958
It'd break him inside.
He hates him.

59:21.375 --> 59:23.750
That way he shakes off
his part of the guilt.

59:25.958 --> 59:28.500
With hate he's managed
to forge ahead.

59:28.667 --> 59:32.458
Everyone does what they can
and Abel's done it with hate.

59:34.292 --> 59:36.667
If you don't owe him anything,
what does Víctor want?

59:41.333 --> 59:42.708
He's going to be dismissed.

59:42.875 --> 59:45.667
He and some other higher-ups.

59:45.833 --> 59:48.333
Abel's cabinet doesn't want
anyone in public office

59:48.500 --> 59:51.167
with links to the previous party,
even if they weren't in it.

59:51.333 --> 59:53.500
It's a promise they made
and they're going to keep it.

59:53.667 --> 59:57.625
And Víctor's like a rabid dog,
it means taking everything from him.

59:58.167 --> 59:59.125
He's going down.

59:59.292 --> 1:00:01.167
And if he does go down,
he'll make the loan public.

1:00:01.333 --> 1:00:04.167
The money was stolen, wasn't it?

1:00:05.833 --> 1:00:07.417
He's got both our voices in his phone,

1:00:07.583 --> 1:00:10.667
admitting that he gave me
his father's money and I took it...

1:00:10.833 --> 1:00:12.250
for Abel.

1:00:16.458 --> 1:00:18.417
I let myself be recorded,
like an idiot.

1:00:20.083 --> 1:00:21.333
Fuck...

1:00:24.417 --> 1:00:27.958
He seemed to recognize your car.
I didn't know you knew each other.

1:00:30.542 --> 1:00:32.250
I never told anyone.

1:00:37.958 --> 1:00:38.958
Nora...

1:00:42.333 --> 1:00:44.000
I can help you.

1:00:44.833 --> 1:00:46.625
If you help me.

1:00:49.417 --> 1:00:52.292
I can try to convince him.
I think I know how.

1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:56.875
It has to be tonight.

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:13.250
<i>Lourdes wants to go over</i>
<i>the outline of your speech,</i>

1:01:13.417 --> 1:01:15.708

<i>at your party tomorrow.</i>

1:01:15.875 --> 1:01:17.750
<i>Maybe we can sort out the issue</i>

1:01:17.917 --> 1:01:21.042
<i>of the change of headline</i>

1:01:21.667 --> 1:01:23.042

1:01:23.208 --> 1:01:24.333

1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:26.458

<i>Plunder?</i>

1:01:26.625 --> 1:01:28.500
<i>What fucking "plunder"?</i>
<i>We haven't stolen anything.</i>

1:01:28.667 --> 1:01:31.292
<i>I need to get across</i>
<i>the sensation of legitimacy,</i>

1:01:31.458 --> 1:01:32.958

1:01:33.583 --> 1:01:35.875

1:01:44.417 --> 1:01:45.708

<i>Got your "communion suit"</i>

1:02:23.375 --> 1:02:25.042
It's right there so I don't forget.

1:02:25.208 --> 1:02:27.792
Ironed and with glistening

1:02:27.958 --> 1:02:29.333
<i>That's the way I like it.</i>

1:02:29.500 --> 1:02:31.042

1:02:40.292 --> 1:02:41.375

1:04:13.708 --> 1:04:16.042
I want Virginia to go tomorrow.

1:04:16.958 --> 1:04:18.292
I don't want her here.

1:04:52.708 --> 1:04:54.958
If you're going to puke,
tell me and I'll stop.

1:04:55.583 --> 1:04:58.083
What do you care,
this is a fucking trash heap.

1:06:12.083 --> 1:06:13.625
What are you doing?

1:06:19.750 --> 1:06:22.625
Tomorrow I'll have to get the train
to get my car because of you.

1:06:26.625 --> 1:06:28.125
I'm thirsty.

1:06:52.042 --> 1:06:55.125
Do you know, last year I had it
in my mouth for 7 minutes?

1:06:55.958 --> 1:06:57.917
7, exactly. I counted.

1:07:00.833 --> 1:07:02.375
I don't want to know about it.

1:07:03.042 --> 1:07:04.833
I don't give a fuck
if you don't want to know.

1:07:06.875 --> 1:07:08.208
Do you know why
I didn't pull the trigger?

1:07:08.375 --> 1:07:09.958
Víctor, you're drunk.
Cut it out.

1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:14.333
Because a friend of my father
did the same thing

1:07:14.500 --> 1:07:17.875
and blew off his jaw,
straight onto the office wallpaper.

1:07:18.292 --> 1:07:19.833
But he didn't kill himself,

1:07:21.458 --> 1:07:23.417
he was on the floor,
not knowing what to do,

1:07:23.583 --> 1:07:27.542
bawling and trying to squeal
like a pig, but he couldn't

1:07:27.708 --> 1:07:30.083
because his tongue
hung to one side.

1:07:32.292 --> 1:07:33.875
He shat himself.

1:07:36.167 --> 1:07:38.667
When the ambulance came,
the stench was unbearable,

1:07:38.833 --> 1:07:41.250
but he was alive, conscious.

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:48.625
I was scared that the same thing
will happen to me.

1:07:50.542 --> 1:07:53.583
I wouldn't die, I'd just be staring
at my teeth on the wall.

1:07:55.708 --> 1:07:57.208
I was scared of the pain.

1:07:58.458 --> 1:08:00.542
The smell of my own shit.

1:08:04.792 --> 1:08:08.708
I didn't pull the trigger,
I didn't do anything, as usual.

1:08:33.750 --> 1:08:34.583
Say it.

1:08:36.250 --> 1:08:37.625
What do you want me to say?

1:08:37.792 --> 1:08:40.292
That my mother and I deserved it,
all this shit.

1:08:41.375 --> 1:08:42.333
Yes,

1:08:43.250 --> 1:08:47.542
we deserved it for making out
we didn't know what was going on.

1:08:47.708 --> 1:08:51.125
If you know that,
why do you want me to say it?

1:09:23.042 --> 1:09:24.667
I stink like a drunk.

1:09:36.875 --> 1:09:39.833
SUNDAY

1:09:51.250 --> 1:09:52.417
Abel.

1:09:52.583 --> 1:09:54.708
It's very early.

1:09:57.125 --> 1:09:58.542
I'm nervous.

1:10:02.417 --> 1:10:04.375
Are you alright?
Shall I make you some herb tea?

1:10:04.542 --> 1:10:05.583
No.

1:10:06.917 --> 1:10:08.625
It's because of tomorrow.

1:10:10.583 --> 1:10:12.458
I don't know if
I'll be able to do it.

1:10:21.750 --> 1:10:23.333
Of course you will.

1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.292
I'm going to run a little
before the heat sets in,

1:10:30.458 --> 1:10:31.917
to clear my mind.

1:10:35.083 --> 1:10:37.250
Sleep a bit more. Rest.

1:12:33.542 --> 1:12:36.792
Martín, it's Víctor Alarcón.
No, don't hang up!

1:12:36.958 --> 1:12:39.250
I can't locate Abel.
Listen to me!

1:12:39.417 --> 1:12:41.708
I'm going to enjoy fucking up
your party before calling the press

1:12:41.875 --> 1:12:44.042
and telling them what
Abel is really like.

1:12:44.208 --> 1:12:46.167
And where he got
the money to get cured.

1:12:46.333 --> 1:12:47.958
Remember Carlos, Abel's brother?

1:12:48.125 --> 1:12:50.292
The press are going love
how he died.

1:13:07.833 --> 1:13:10.458
ABEL, CALL ME. URGENT.

1:13:43.833 --> 1:13:45.250
Hello?

1:13:46.583 --> 1:13:48.167
Oh, hi, Martín. Go ahead.

1:13:49.667 --> 1:13:51.500
No, he's not here.
He's gone out.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:56.708
I don't know, for a walk, I guess.

1:13:56.875 --> 1:14:00.167
You know he always
leave his cellphone everywhere.

1:14:03.167 --> 1:14:05.583
Yes, I'll tell him when I see him.

1:14:06.917 --> 1:14:09.500
Martín, is something wrong?

1:14:14.417 --> 1:14:16.875
Yes, I'll tell him it's urgent, okay.

1:14:18.625 --> 1:14:20.458
Will I see you soon?

1:14:23.208 --> 1:14:24.875
'Bye.

1:15:05.792 --> 1:15:07.167
What happened?

1:15:09.708 --> 1:15:10.917
Are you alright?

1:15:11.083 --> 1:15:12.208
Yes.

1:15:12.375 --> 1:15:15.208
I'm just clumsy, I'll pick it up.

1:15:18.333 --> 1:15:19.500
You're leaving?

1:15:19.667 --> 1:15:21.292
Yes, I'm going now.

1:15:21.458 --> 1:15:24.375
The newspaper will come for
my stuff when it suits you.

1:15:24.708 --> 1:15:27.083
Tell me where to leave it
so it's not in the way.

1:15:29.125 --> 1:15:31.333
Stay, please...

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:33.417
for the party.

1:15:33.583 --> 1:15:34.625
For Abel.

1:15:34.958 --> 1:15:36.250
I can't.

1:15:36.625 --> 1:15:39.458
I don't want to see Abel lose
everything he's fought for.

1:15:40.667 --> 1:15:42.792
What he's achieved is very important.

1:15:43.833 --> 1:15:45.292
Don't spoil it.

1:16:06.750 --> 1:16:09.875
<i>Don't take him to my house,</i>
<i>my mother's not to see him.</i>

1:16:10.125 --> 1:16:12.250
<i>To Nora, to Nora!</i>

1:16:30.875 --> 1:16:32.583
I couldn't do anything.

1:16:36.875 --> 1:16:38.167
I'm sorry.

1:16:43.875 --> 1:16:45.792
I only ask one more thing of you.

1:16:48.167 --> 1:16:49.542
What?

1:16:49.875 --> 1:16:52.458
Lend me your car. Now.

1:16:52.625 --> 1:16:54.125
I'll take you wherever you want.

1:16:55.375 --> 1:16:56.667
Lend it to me.

1:17:03.917 --> 1:17:05.708
He's scared but he's back.

1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000
I told you he'd come back
when he's hungry.

1:17:08.167 --> 1:17:10.708
-He'll kill himself if he keeps that up.
-Leave him.

1:17:10.875 --> 1:17:12.583
If he's come back,
it's for a reason.

1:17:13.500 --> 1:17:15.000
Where'd you find him?

1:17:15.167 --> 1:17:16.625
I told you,

1:17:17.167 --> 1:17:18.375
he came back by himself.

1:17:19.292 --> 1:17:20.333
It's another one.

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:29.792
I have to go get the car, Mom.

1:17:30.542 --> 1:17:31.708
Will you be alright?

1:17:31.875 --> 1:17:33.292
Yes.

1:17:34.250 --> 1:17:36.208
He's here with us.

1:17:36.542 --> 1:17:38.292
And that's good.

1:17:48.333 --> 1:17:50.875
SON OF A BITCH

1:18:55.667 --> 1:19:01.500
<i>The train for Seville Central</i>
<i>will be arriving shortly.</i>

1:21:43.458 --> 1:21:45.375
I was looking for you.

1:21:48.625 --> 1:21:50.625
Have you seen my phone?
I can't find it.

1:21:51.458 --> 1:21:53.708
You'll have left it lying around,
as usual.

1:21:59.708 --> 1:22:01.167
Nora.

1:22:08.625 --> 1:22:11.417
Thank you. For everything.

1:22:14.583 --> 1:22:16.750
It's a gift for you.

1:24:00.667 --> 1:24:02.583
Is it true what Martín said?

1:24:04.458 --> 1:24:05.792
Is it true or not?

1:24:12.250 --> 1:24:13.625
Fuck, Nora...

1:24:38.125 --> 1:24:40.833
Víctor was always bragging
about all they had...

1:24:41.000 --> 1:24:43.083
I thought what he gave me
was peanuts for him and his dad.

1:24:43.250 --> 1:24:45.375
-And it was just...
-What? Just what?

1:24:45.542 --> 1:24:46.375
Money... just money.

1:24:46.542 --> 1:24:47.375
-Just money?
-Yes.

1:24:47.875 --> 1:24:49.625
Money that grows on trees?

1:24:50.083 --> 1:24:52.458
That scum's money
is never just money.

1:24:52.625 --> 1:24:53.917
It's always something worse.

1:24:54.250 --> 1:24:56.917
I didn't know what to do
and I wanted to help you.

1:24:57.625 --> 1:25:00.042
But I gave it all back,
we don't owe him anything.

1:25:00.208 --> 1:25:01.458
Don't be ridiculous.

1:25:01.625 --> 1:25:05.125
That money, that debt,
will never go away.

1:25:07.417 --> 1:25:08.750
No, don't touch me.

1:25:08.917 --> 1:25:10.583
Don't touch me.
I don't want you to touch me!

1:25:10.750 --> 1:25:12.333
-Listen to me...
-No! Shut up!

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:15.042
You have no right
to say anything! None!

1:25:15.208 --> 1:25:16.708
So shut up!

1:25:27.917 --> 1:25:31.875
When the press hears the recording,
I'll have to give it all up.

1:25:32.208 --> 1:25:35.833
I'll be remembered as one more liar,
because of you.

1:25:36.875 --> 1:25:38.625
You're the same as your father.

1:25:38.792 --> 1:25:42.458
Letting himself be bought by anyone
who puts a collar around his neck.

1:25:43.958 --> 1:25:45.417
You did the same thing.

1:25:47.958 --> 1:25:50.667
You let Víctor and his father
put one on you.

1:25:51.583 --> 1:25:53.667
And what's worse,
they put one on me.

1:25:58.375 --> 1:26:00.917
That fucker must be enjoying the joke.

1:26:04.417 --> 1:26:06.292
It's my fault.

1:26:06.458 --> 1:26:08.792
That's the truth
and I don't care who knows.

1:26:08.958 --> 1:26:09.875
If only.

1:26:10.500 --> 1:26:13.542
But nobody will give a shit
about that truth.

1:26:13.708 --> 1:26:15.083
Don't you realize?

1:26:17.208 --> 1:26:19.750
Yes, I'm starting to.

1:26:19.917 --> 1:26:21.125
Now?

1:26:22.458 --> 1:26:24.208
It's all over now.

1:26:31.292 --> 1:26:33.333
You've turned me into what I hate.

1:26:35.292 --> 1:26:36.958
You've made me weak.

1:26:45.167 --> 1:26:47.125
If I go, you have options.

1:26:49.042 --> 1:26:52.208
No, you're not going, Nora.

1:26:53.750 --> 1:26:56.292
You have to face the consequences
of what you've done.

1:26:56.458 --> 1:26:58.250
Say you did it out of despair,

1:26:59.958 --> 1:27:02.250
out of ignorance,
whatever the fuck you want.

1:27:03.875 --> 1:27:05.292
But I have nothing to do with it.

1:27:08.542 --> 1:27:09.750
Say whatever...

1:27:19.542 --> 1:27:21.208
What'll happen to me when I do?

1:27:36.375 --> 1:27:37.375
Abel.

1:27:37.750 --> 1:27:39.708
Not now, Martín.
Give me a minute.

1:27:39.875 --> 1:27:40.792
Víctor's outside,

1:27:42.125 --> 1:27:44.625
-asking for you.
-Where is he?

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.083
In the hall, alone.

1:27:57.083 --> 1:27:58.083
Take it easy.

1:27:58.250 --> 1:28:01.458
I don't want to see you on the Internet
tomorrow beating each other up.

1:28:19.083 --> 1:28:20.875
-Abel.
-What the fuck are you doing here?

1:28:21.042 --> 1:28:24.458
-Get out.
-Listen. Abel!

1:28:24.625 --> 1:28:27.250
Get out or I'll tear your head off,
you son of a bitch!

1:28:29.667 --> 1:28:30.708
There you go.

1:28:32.875 --> 1:28:34.375
Do what you like with it.

1:28:35.500 --> 1:28:38.000
I don't want it near me, it's over.

1:28:39.625 --> 1:28:42.000
Are you going to pop up
every time you want money?

1:28:44.583 --> 1:28:45.833
How many copies do you have?

1:28:46.542 --> 1:28:49.292
You're poison, just like your family.

1:28:50.333 --> 1:28:52.250
Look at the way you talk.

1:28:52.417 --> 1:28:54.625
And you're not even drunk
like you were before.

1:28:55.500 --> 1:28:57.625
Sober and happy to be.

1:29:03.458 --> 1:29:06.375
No, I have no other copy.

1:29:07.167 --> 1:29:09.250
You'll have to live with that.

1:29:09.583 --> 1:29:13.208
Only Martín knows.
And you trust him, right?

1:29:18.375 --> 1:29:19.417
Why?

1:29:21.792 --> 1:29:24.500
Do you know how scary it is
for someone to want you dead?

1:29:26.875 --> 1:29:28.667
And to think you deserve it?

1:29:32.333 --> 1:29:35.458
Maybe in a couple of years
you'll know how scary it is.

1:29:37.417 --> 1:29:40.667
-You and I are very different.
-No.

1:29:41.542 --> 1:29:43.750
You and I are
exactly the same, Abel.

1:29:44.917 --> 1:29:47.583
Only your wife gave you
a second chance.

1:29:49.875 --> 1:29:51.542
Go.

1:29:57.875 --> 1:29:59.167
I forgot.

1:30:02.875 --> 1:30:05.667
Have a good time.
You've got a party, right?

1:30:07.167 --> 1:30:10.167
-It's a good day to celebrate.
-Go.

1:31:24.625 --> 1:31:25.958
Everything's alright.

1:31:29.125 --> 1:31:30.500
Nothing's going to happen.

1:31:31.625 --> 1:31:32.958
I'm glad.

1:31:35.583 --> 1:31:38.125
You must've had some shitty days.

1:31:39.625 --> 1:31:42.000
I know now that everything
you did was to help me.

1:31:44.875 --> 1:31:46.917
The same as everything
you did for your father.

1:31:53.833 --> 1:31:55.167
We'll forget.

1:31:56.958 --> 1:31:58.375
We deserve to.

1:32:23.708 --> 1:32:25.042
I love you.

1:32:34.875 --> 1:32:36.167
Abel, I'm leaving.

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:40.250
Where are you going?

1:32:41.958 --> 1:32:43.125
I don't know.

1:32:46.542 --> 1:32:47.667
Are you listening to yourself?

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:50.542
You sound crazy.

1:32:51.292 --> 1:32:52.583
What about you?

1:32:53.583 --> 1:32:54.417
Do you hear me?

1:32:56.375 --> 1:32:58.667
Do you see me?
Do you listen to me?

1:33:02.458 --> 1:33:06.042
You want the woman who sings
a cheesy love song like it's all fine.

1:33:06.208 --> 1:33:07.708
Who says nothing.

1:33:12.583 --> 1:33:14.042
What do you mean by that?

1:33:18.750 --> 1:33:20.375
That you're right,

1:33:21.292 --> 1:33:24.667
that it's no fucking fun anymore
having a collar around your neck.

1:33:26.958 --> 1:33:28.958
I don't want it.

1:34:03.083 --> 1:34:06.208
<i>All of a sudden, I sing</i>

1:34:10.708 --> 1:34:17.917
<i>and feel the wind</i>
<i>flow over my hands.</i>

1:34:18.333 --> 1:34:25.125
<i>Everything is different</i>
<i>when I look at myself.</i>

1:34:25.667 --> 1:34:29.542
<i>Now I understand...</i>

1:34:31.917 --> 1:34:35.000
<i>If the world explodes...</i>

1:34:38.417 --> 1:34:42.917
<i>If the world explodes...</i>

1:35:08.083 --> 1:35:11.042
<i>to my mother</i>

1:36:22.875 --> 1:36:25.917
<i>Inspired by "A Doll's House"</i>
<i>by Henrik Ibsen</i>
