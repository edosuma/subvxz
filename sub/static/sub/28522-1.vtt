Beat, Lost In Your Eyes.

02:52.585 --> 02:53.816
I mean come on now.

02:53.816 --> 02:55.928
Anyway, little bit about myself.

02:55.928 --> 02:57.979
I was born and raised
in the county of Dade,

02:57.979 --> 03:00.249
Opa-locka, Florida which
is of course the backdrop

03:00.249 --> 03:01.989
for this evening's event.

03:01.989 --> 03:03.796
A graduate of Norland Senior High School.

03:03.796 --> 03:05.619
That's right, the mighty Vikings,

03:05.619 --> 03:08.839
and a member of the University
of Miami School of Medicine.

03:08.839 --> 03:11.756
That's right, ladies, I'm a doctor.

03:13.218 --> 03:15.733
Don't worry about it, I'm taken, anyway.

03:15.733 --> 03:17.935
- Yo, yo, yo man, look, if
you gonna be doing all that

03:17.935 --> 03:20.002
why don't you go on to the room?

03:20.002 --> 03:21.352
Or go outside or something, I mean

03:21.352 --> 03:22.996
you see I'm in here working.

03:22.996 --> 03:23.859
- Work?

03:23.859 --> 03:24.900
No, no, no, no bruh.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.378
Listen, tonight is not about work.

03:27.378 --> 03:30.711
Tonight, we are about to have a histor--

03:38.013 --> 03:39.846
About to have a party.

03:41.170 --> 03:42.788
- How much is this?

03:42.788 --> 03:46.871
I had a go at 10 man, put
the rest on pump three.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.703
Alright, thanks man.

04:09.104 --> 04:10.879
- Go ahead on, man.

04:10.879 --> 04:12.129
- Whatever man.

04:15.908 --> 04:18.658
- Hey man, let me get a gar, man.

04:20.459 --> 04:21.625
No, Backwoods.

04:54.282 --> 04:56.045
- Bruh, you got a light?

04:56.045 --> 04:58.330
- Yeah, I got a light.

04:58.330 --> 05:02.305
I don't smoke though, least not no more.

05:02.305 --> 05:06.472
All this gas, you ain't about
to burn me up in flames.

05:07.606 --> 05:10.758
- You know what, you right, you right

05:10.758 --> 05:14.675
but brother, you know it's
kind of crazy out here

05:14.675 --> 05:17.592
so go head on and be safe, alright?

05:20.204 --> 05:23.537
- Yeah, alright, you be safe too, homie.

06:04.683 --> 06:06.213
- Ant called yet?

06:06.213 --> 06:07.046
- No.

06:07.922 --> 06:11.543
- You wanna wait on him
a little bit longer?

06:11.543 --> 06:12.376
- Nope.

06:13.438 --> 06:15.019
- Well the food's ready.

06:15.019 --> 06:18.415
I could get my mother to drop us off.

06:18.415 --> 06:21.565
- Thank you, that'd be nice.

06:21.565 --> 06:23.973
- Ma, drop us off at Ant's house.

06:23.973 --> 06:27.171
- Why don't you just drive yourself?

06:27.171 --> 06:29.549
- I told you how I felt about tonight.

06:29.549 --> 06:31.363
I'm not driving tonight.

06:31.363 --> 06:33.539
- Then why don't you just stay home?

06:33.539 --> 06:36.007
- Mother, I'm a grown woman.

06:36.007 --> 06:39.035
I can make my own decisions, Jesus.

06:39.035 --> 06:41.302
- Alright, alright, okay.

06:41.302 --> 06:43.637
Don't forget to wear your sweater.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.470
- Mother!

06:50.894 --> 06:52.787
- Did y'all pack the
food in the car already?

06:52.787 --> 06:53.620
- Yes, ma.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.370
Geez.

06:56.370 --> 06:59.126
Listen, I know you don't understand

06:59.126 --> 07:01.069
and I know you think I'm crazy

07:01.069 --> 07:03.291
but none of that matters right now.

07:03.291 --> 07:04.722
Tonight is different.

07:04.722 --> 07:09.058
I need you to just stay
home, don't answer the door,

07:09.058 --> 07:13.235
just pray and wait for the
shadow to pass over, okay?

07:13.235 --> 07:15.383
- Should we put goat's blood on the door

07:15.383 --> 07:17.213
and call Moses?

07:18.078 --> 07:19.124
- Mother, I'm serious.

07:19.124 --> 07:20.374
It's not funny.

07:21.226 --> 07:24.296
If you're not going to listen
to me I can't help you.

07:24.296 --> 07:27.360
- Oh girl, shut up, you know
I'm just playing with you.

07:27.360 --> 07:29.713
You don't have no sense of humor?

07:29.713 --> 07:31.630
How you deal with Inez?

07:34.610 --> 07:37.110
- I ask myself that every day.

07:38.502 --> 07:39.335
- Really?

07:40.353 --> 07:42.339
Do you read every day?

07:42.339 --> 07:43.663
- Uh-huh.

07:43.663 --> 07:46.899
- Same thing or different passages?

07:46.899 --> 07:48.178
- A different chapter of Proverbs

07:48.178 --> 07:50.034
for every day of the month.

07:50.034 --> 07:51.284
- Does it help?

07:52.766 --> 07:53.599
Inez?

07:55.029 --> 07:57.362
Does reading every day help?

07:58.806 --> 07:59.806
Knock knock.

08:02.497 --> 08:03.506
- What?

08:03.506 --> 08:05.693
- Reading, every day, does it help?

08:05.693 --> 08:07.612
- Oh yeah, yeah.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.862
Yeah, it keeps me straight.

08:39.777 --> 08:42.051
- What's up, player?

08:42.051 --> 08:43.134
Y'all better lock that door.

08:43.134 --> 08:46.946
- Ladies and gentlemen, may
I introduce Dwayne Shepherd

08:46.946 --> 08:49.064
otherwise known as the Shep.

08:49.064 --> 08:53.231
Aka D-Shep, aka Big Bo Peep,
aka Little Gold Herder,

08:54.605 --> 08:56.499
aka you know the rest.

08:57.992 --> 08:59.751
- Whoa, whoa, whoa
black man, where you been?

08:59.751 --> 09:01.035
- Over yonder way, yeah.

09:01.035 --> 09:02.148
- Across the field?

09:02.148 --> 09:03.805
- Nah, nah, nah, past that, past that.

09:03.805 --> 09:05.157
- Over there across the water?

09:05.157 --> 09:06.928
- No, no, no keep going past the water.

09:06.928 --> 09:08.293
- Over there in them mountains?

09:08.293 --> 09:10.833
- Higher than that, up
there with them shepherd's.

09:12.275 --> 09:13.108
KD.

09:15.583 --> 09:19.093
You don't know what's
funny or not, you bastard.

09:19.093 --> 09:21.618
- Hey hold up, man, you
brought your camera?

09:22.931 --> 09:23.764
- Bam!

09:24.751 --> 09:27.370
Of course I got my camera,
man, what you think this is?

09:27.370 --> 09:28.893
I'm a man of my word.

09:28.893 --> 09:29.964
- Stop.

09:29.964 --> 09:32.518
Chill, chill, don't break
my stuff, don't break.

09:32.518 --> 09:34.003
Yo man!

09:37.781 --> 09:39.596
- Hey, how did it go in practice man?

09:39.596 --> 09:41.126
Did y'all get in the ring?

09:41.126 --> 09:43.013
- Well I made your boy Chris tap out.

09:43.013 --> 09:44.096
- Yeah right.

09:45.629 --> 09:46.465
What?

09:46.465 --> 09:47.895
- Yeah, got in the ring
and made him tap out.

09:47.895 --> 09:49.544
That boy's soft, man, he gone.

09:49.544 --> 09:51.640
Your girl Summer, she took
his heart a long time ago.

09:51.640 --> 09:53.300
That boy done, done.

09:53.300 --> 09:55.920
- We are here in front of
the Dade County Courthouse

09:55.920 --> 09:58.640
and the verdict on Thomas Crow is in.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.899
The verdict is not guilty.

10:00.899 --> 10:02.617
- You have got to be kidding me.

10:02.617 --> 10:04.770
- All seven counts of
murder in the first degree.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.246
The cold blooded murder
of the seven little girls

10:07.246 --> 10:09.473
involved in the bombing at
King Elementary School--

10:09.473 --> 10:11.539
- Man, that's ridiculous.

10:11.539 --> 10:13.008
- Clearly there is shock and terror,

10:13.008 --> 10:15.736
emotion and electricity fill the air.

10:15.736 --> 10:18.247
We caught up with district
attorney Xavier Marshall,

10:18.247 --> 10:20.105
the prosecuting attorney on the case

10:20.105 --> 10:23.716
and clearly as you can
see he is heartbroken.

10:25.456 --> 10:29.623
- That verdict is not reflective
of the state's position.

10:33.049 --> 10:33.882
I'm sorry.

10:37.855 --> 10:41.033
Our prayers go out to the victims,

10:41.033 --> 10:45.500
the families of the victims
of this most horrific tragedy.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.068
It will not be forgotten.

10:47.068 --> 10:48.056
Thank you, that's all..

10:58.531 --> 11:00.978
- Yeah well if you people
paid your rent on time

11:00.978 --> 11:05.613
I wouldn't have to come
around to your freaky houses.

11:05.613 --> 11:06.762
- Mr. Rumineski.

11:06.762 --> 11:07.997
- Yeah?

11:07.997 --> 11:10.041
- Something we can help you with?

11:10.041 --> 11:11.589
- I'm coming here on the fourth.

11:11.589 --> 11:13.652
Just a reminder that the rent is due

11:13.652 --> 11:15.819
on the fifth or it's late.

11:16.774 --> 11:20.425
You know, I'm not gonna
send anymore notifications

11:20.425 --> 11:24.008
or paperwork and I'm
not paying any lawyer.

11:25.147 --> 11:29.147
What I am gonna do is I'm
gonna call the sheriff

11:30.146 --> 11:31.682
and he can take care of all those people

11:31.682 --> 11:33.323
that don't pay.

11:33.323 --> 11:35.010
I'm not gonna do this anymore.

11:35.010 --> 11:36.736
- Mr. Rumineski, what does that have to do

11:36.736 --> 11:39.960
with any of us, I mean we've
always paid you on time.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.985
Our payment is in for this month.

11:42.985 --> 11:45.242
- No it's not.

11:45.242 --> 11:46.366
- What?

11:46.366 --> 11:50.769
- You boys are usually on
time but not this time, no.

11:50.769 --> 11:52.666
- cracker.

11:52.666 --> 11:56.068
- Look, I know it's close to Christmas

11:56.068 --> 11:59.066
and I know you people like
to spend a lot of money

11:59.066 --> 12:02.097
but you've gotta get
your priorities straight.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.380
- Mr. Rumineski, I slipped the check

12:03.380 --> 12:05.187
under your door the other day.

12:05.187 --> 12:06.154
- Check?

12:06.154 --> 12:07.440
- Yeah, I slipped a check under your door

12:07.440 --> 12:09.544
just the other day.

12:09.544 --> 12:11.032
- I don't take checks.

12:11.032 --> 12:12.877
- Why, the check is good.

12:12.877 --> 12:15.438
- Don't trust them new niggas over there.

12:15.438 --> 12:17.633
- Mr. Rumineski, you know what, I'm gonna,

12:17.633 --> 12:21.701
first thing in the morning I'll
come by with a money order.

12:21.701 --> 12:22.534
Okay?

12:23.685 --> 12:25.519
- Alright, you boys are good boys.

12:25.519 --> 12:26.352
- Boy?

12:28.472 --> 12:31.882
- Have a good night, I'll
see you tomorrow morning.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.033
- Have a good night Mr.--

12:33.033 --> 12:35.873
- Don't mind him, don't
mind, you have a good night.

12:35.873 --> 12:37.971
Okay, and I'll see you in the morning.

12:37.971 --> 12:39.125
- What are
you carrying on for?

12:39.125 --> 12:40.875
Get away from my car.

12:47.883 --> 12:48.716
- See?

12:50.474 --> 12:53.265
That's what I'm talking about.

12:53.265 --> 12:55.515
I told you to pay that man.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.081
See you play too much.

12:59.081 --> 13:00.982
- I did, I gave him a check, KD.

13:00.982 --> 13:04.239
- Told you to give him a money order!

13:04.239 --> 13:05.406
A money order!

13:08.153 --> 13:09.145
See that's your problem.

13:09.145 --> 13:11.800
You don't listen, man.

13:11.800 --> 13:13.300
You play too much.

13:21.887 --> 13:23.590
- You know what man?

13:23.590 --> 13:24.748
You need to get up off me, man.

13:24.748 --> 13:26.143
I'm a grown man, bruh.

13:26.143 --> 13:27.254
- Really?

13:27.254 --> 13:28.986
Well if you're so grown
why is it necessary

13:28.986 --> 13:30.468
that you remind me of that?

13:30.468 --> 13:33.197
Shouldn't I just know that?

13:33.197 --> 13:34.480
- You need to chill, man.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.617
You really need to chill.

13:40.505 --> 13:41.621
You need to chill man.

13:41.621 --> 13:44.223
What you need to do is really chill.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.789
Who is this?

13:51.002 --> 13:51.859
- Hey Ant.

13:51.859 --> 13:52.763
- Hey.

13:52.763 --> 13:53.748
- We got chicken wings and fried rice.

13:53.748 --> 13:54.689
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

13:54.689 --> 13:55.522
How did y'all get here?

13:55.522 --> 13:56.564
- My mother dropped us off.

13:56.564 --> 13:58.245
- Your mama?

13:58.245 --> 13:59.078
I didn't--

14:00.718 --> 14:02.075
Damn, shut up.

14:02.075 --> 14:04.158
- We were waiting on you.

14:06.038 --> 14:08.948
But we figured you forgot or fell asleep

14:08.948 --> 14:10.262
or something like that.

14:10.262 --> 14:11.135
- I was on my way.

14:11.135 --> 14:11.968
- Really?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.254
- Baby, I was on my way, come on now.

14:16.254 --> 14:17.198
- Please.

14:17.198 --> 14:18.448
We're here now.

14:19.687 --> 14:21.465
What's up, Shep?

14:21.465 --> 14:22.840
- Ha, ain't nothing shaking but the leaves

14:22.840 --> 14:23.993
in the tree that wouldn't be shaking

14:23.993 --> 14:25.152
if it wasn't for me.

14:27.340 --> 14:28.923
- You are so crazy.

14:29.761 --> 14:31.261
How you doing, KD?

14:36.508 --> 14:37.925
I said hello, KD.

14:38.837 --> 14:40.658
- Actually you asked me how I was doing

14:40.658 --> 14:43.802
so I figured you could
see how I was doing.

14:43.802 --> 14:46.289
- Okay, y'all can have the food

14:46.289 --> 14:48.137
and we'll just go, alright?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.316
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:49.316 --> 14:51.864
- What, clearly we're not welcome here.

14:51.864 --> 14:52.887
- Baby, don't worry about KD.

14:52.887 --> 14:54.711
He is tripping, he been up for three days

14:54.711 --> 14:57.648
on NoDoze and energy drinks
and God knows what else

14:57.648 --> 14:59.702
but he is tripping, don't worry about him.

14:59.702 --> 15:00.993
Don't let him ruin our good time.

15:00.993 --> 15:03.845
We're supposed to have a party now, right?

15:03.845 --> 15:04.928
Party, right?

15:07.876 --> 15:09.522
- You know, you should
count yourself fortunate

15:09.522 --> 15:11.742
that I kind of like you.

15:11.742 --> 15:13.075
- Oh I do, I do.

15:14.704 --> 15:16.066
- Whatever, what's all this?

15:16.066 --> 15:19.189
- Well this, my love, is
the recording of history.

15:19.189 --> 15:20.506
My directorial debut.

15:20.506 --> 15:22.074
- No, no, Ant, stop.

15:22.074 --> 15:23.280
- Come on, come on
now baby, say something

15:23.280 --> 15:25.530
to the camera, come on now.

15:26.441 --> 15:29.388
- Alright, what do you wanna know?

15:29.388 --> 15:32.789
- Well tell us who you are.

15:32.789 --> 15:34.872
- Inez Miller, what else?

15:35.857 --> 15:37.341
- Tell us something about yourself.

15:37.341 --> 15:39.836
- Well what do you know about me?

15:39.836 --> 15:41.068
- Well from what I know of you

15:41.068 --> 15:43.964
you are a beautiful, intelligent,

15:43.964 --> 15:46.792
spiritual and forgiving woman.

15:46.792 --> 15:47.959
- Good answer.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.691
- What, pray tell,
is your relationship

15:50.691 --> 15:55.509
to the amazingly handsome
young man behind the camera?

15:55.509 --> 15:59.153
- The young man behind the
camera is my boyfriend.

15:59.153 --> 16:01.653
My habitually tardy boyfriend.

16:02.926 --> 16:05.265
- Why you gotta bring up old stuff, huh?

16:05.265 --> 16:07.484
- It's getting crowded out there.

16:07.484 --> 16:09.609
What are they having, a
block party or something?

16:09.609 --> 16:11.943
- A tear down a block party more like it.

16:11.943 --> 16:13.878
- Tear down the block, what's that?

16:13.878 --> 16:15.406
- Oh y'all ain't heard of them?

16:15.406 --> 16:16.478
- Heard what?

16:16.478 --> 16:19.211
- The verdict from the
Thomas Crow case came back.

16:19.211 --> 16:20.325
They let him go.

16:20.325 --> 16:21.240
- What?

16:21.240 --> 16:22.598
- Not guilty?

16:22.598 --> 16:25.259
- Not guilty, just like OJ but in reverse.

16:25.259 --> 16:27.498
- Oh my lord.

16:27.498 --> 16:29.591
- Them boys gonna act a fool,
especially when Barack lose.

16:29.591 --> 16:31.615
- Hold, hold, hold on man, hold on now.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.402
We are here to witness
history and we will.

16:34.402 --> 16:35.323
Yes we can, yes we can.

16:35.323 --> 16:36.954
- No, don't get me wrong, player.

16:36.954 --> 16:40.913
I know we can and I know
we should but will we?

16:40.913 --> 16:42.406
Shout out for him brother.

16:42.406 --> 16:43.604
I done prayed to the Koran that the lord

16:43.604 --> 16:45.963
protect him and his family and whatnot

16:45.963 --> 16:48.857
but will they let him lead the country?

16:48.857 --> 16:50.180
I doubt it.

16:50.180 --> 16:52.621
- Will they let him lead?

16:52.621 --> 16:54.503
- Yeah, will they let
him lead the country?

16:54.503 --> 16:55.682
- I don't think it's up to them.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.515
- Then who's it up to?

16:58.705 --> 17:01.847
- Tonight on Dateline,
two minds, two opinions,

17:01.847 --> 17:04.799
one much finer than
the other, let's watch.

17:04.799 --> 17:06.756
- The people that voted for him,

17:06.756 --> 17:09.646
the people that support
him and ultimately God.

17:09.646 --> 17:11.564
- Which God, whose God?

17:13.007 --> 17:15.198
I know I serve God and from what I know

17:15.198 --> 17:16.925
about you you serve God.

17:16.925 --> 17:18.204
You see we've got a bit of an impasse

17:18.204 --> 17:20.469
on what we call him but it's okay

17:20.469 --> 17:22.369
and sha Allah, you'll come around.

17:22.369 --> 17:24.316
What I'm saying is this.

17:24.316 --> 17:26.316
The God I'm talking about
is not necessarily the God

17:26.316 --> 17:27.651
they talking about.

17:27.651 --> 17:30.055
You see, some people God is money.

17:30.055 --> 17:32.384
Some people God is stature and power.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.375
Some people God is government.

17:35.375 --> 17:38.241
In God we trust, what
kind of God you trust?

17:38.241 --> 17:39.939
- There is only one God.

17:39.939 --> 17:41.962
- True, I know that so
what you trying to say?

17:41.962 --> 17:43.752
- Alright, you making some logical points

17:43.752 --> 17:46.335
but answer one simple question.

17:47.278 --> 17:48.968
- Okay.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.459
- Do you believe in God?

17:50.459 --> 17:51.568
- Yes I do.

17:51.568 --> 17:53.302
What kind of God you talking about?

17:53.302 --> 17:56.690
- The God, the only one,
the one that created us.

17:56.690 --> 17:58.984
- You see this right
here, you see this hat?

17:58.984 --> 18:00.391
What that say?

18:00.391 --> 18:01.462
Bismiallah.

18:01.462 --> 18:02.990
You know what that mean?

18:02.990 --> 18:05.218
That mean in the name of God.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.262
The only one created,
the one that created us.

18:07.262 --> 18:08.278
That answer your question?

18:08.278 --> 18:09.383
Yes, I believe in God.

18:09.383 --> 18:12.122
- Alright, and that God
is all powerful, correct?

18:12.122 --> 18:13.002
- Correct.

18:13.002 --> 18:15.839
- Then tell me, what's impossible for him?

18:15.839 --> 18:17.814
What can't he make happen
if it's in his will?

18:17.814 --> 18:19.491
If he wants Barack Obama to be elected

18:19.491 --> 18:21.308
then he will be and there nothing you,

18:21.308 --> 18:23.764
me, or anybody else can
say to prevent that.

18:23.764 --> 18:26.571
- Some people say he's the antichrist.

18:26.571 --> 18:27.482
- What?

18:27.482 --> 18:28.763
- Come on with that.

18:28.763 --> 18:31.549
- I'm serious and they can prove it.

18:31.549 --> 18:32.496
- Prove what?

18:32.496 --> 18:34.198
- That he's the antichrist.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.180
It's in the bible.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.213
- It is not in the bible

18:36.213 --> 18:38.150
that Barack Obama is the antichrist.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.866
- Well it does say that
all nations will love him

18:41.866 --> 18:44.312
and that there will be
this charismatic leader

18:44.312 --> 18:46.199
that will just come out of nowhere.

18:46.199 --> 18:48.261
- Hold on, don't bring
that crap up in here.

18:48.261 --> 18:50.403
Now see I know you bought
the chicken and what not

18:50.403 --> 18:51.942
but them damn wings ain't that damn good.

18:51.942 --> 18:54.246
- I ain't gonna lie brother,
these wings is good.

18:54.246 --> 18:55.856
Fire pon di wings!

18:57.096 --> 18:58.170
- You a fool.

18:58.170 --> 19:00.244
- Shep, you tell me.

19:00.244 --> 19:01.207
- Yeah?

19:01.207 --> 19:03.266
- What do you think is gonna happen?

19:03.266 --> 19:05.745
- Well I can't tell
you what's gonna happen

19:05.745 --> 19:07.313
but I can tell you what has happened.

19:07.313 --> 19:10.055
I remember 2000, my
memory ain't that short.

19:10.055 --> 19:11.024
It ain't short enough to think

19:11.024 --> 19:12.678
that everything's gonna be okay.

19:12.678 --> 19:14.528
It ain't gonna be okay.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.758
- You stupid, dog.

19:16.758 --> 19:18.870
- You can tell that by
what happened today.

19:18.870 --> 19:19.966
- That's the most intelligent thing

19:19.966 --> 19:21.963
that you've said all night.

19:23.516 --> 19:27.695
- Well, here comes Clarence
Thomas with an opinion.

19:27.695 --> 19:30.032
Go ahead, tell us what
you think Judge Thomas.

19:30.032 --> 19:31.684
- You really think that's an insult?

19:31.684 --> 19:34.395
By calling me a supreme court justice?

19:34.395 --> 19:38.501
One of the most powerful,
most intelligent black men

19:38.501 --> 19:43.343
in this country, supreme court
justice, that's an insult?

19:43.343 --> 19:45.792
You just proved my point.

19:45.792 --> 19:47.206
- And what is your point, KD?

19:47.206 --> 19:50.733
- My point is that despite
of what happens here tonight

19:50.733 --> 19:53.303
nothing's going to change about you,

19:53.303 --> 19:57.642
nothing's going to change about
how this country sees you.

19:57.642 --> 19:59.908
When you go to sleep tonight,

19:59.908 --> 20:03.177
they'll still look at you as a nigga

20:03.177 --> 20:04.587
and contrary to your delusions

20:04.587 --> 20:06.254
of grandeur, when you
wake up in the morning

20:06.254 --> 20:09.027
you will still be looked at as a nigga

20:09.027 --> 20:12.928
regardless of what happens here tonight

20:12.928 --> 20:15.511
and you believe in that change.

20:17.673 --> 20:20.256
- Ladies and gentlemen, we
just got filmed evidence

20:20.256 --> 20:23.606
that the slave field
mentality still exists.

20:23.606 --> 20:25.189
Just call him Toby.

20:28.521 --> 20:32.688
- That's the name that I
sign on your tuition checks.

20:33.704 --> 20:35.897
- So you gonna start hopping on that, huh?

20:35.897 --> 20:37.950
You gonna bring that back up?

20:37.950 --> 20:39.567
What, that make you feel big?

20:39.567 --> 20:41.955
You feel like a man?

20:41.955 --> 20:42.955
- Who is it?

20:47.229 --> 20:48.062
Who is it?

20:55.149 --> 20:56.868
- No, what you need to
do is keep Peaches' name

20:56.868 --> 20:58.352
out your mouth and find you some business

20:58.352 --> 21:00.719
and stay out of mine.

21:00.719 --> 21:02.386
Shut up, who is you?

21:03.430 --> 21:06.875
tripping, I swear to God.

21:06.875 --> 21:09.708
Hey now, Peaches up in this piece.

21:12.179 --> 21:14.010
What's wrong with y'all?

21:14.010 --> 21:15.079
What kind of party is this?

21:15.079 --> 21:16.811
Y'all ain't playing no music.

21:16.811 --> 21:19.494
Y'all sitting around like
somebody stole your dog.

21:19.494 --> 21:21.234
- We was waiting on you!

21:21.234 --> 21:24.401
- Well I'm here and I brought the liq.

21:25.749 --> 21:27.409
What's up, KD?

21:27.409 --> 21:29.358
You can't say hi to your neighbor?

21:29.358 --> 21:30.960
- How you doing, Peaches?

21:30.960 --> 21:32.793
- Fine as you can see.

21:35.384 --> 21:37.356
Anyway, I invited some of my girls over

21:37.356 --> 21:38.705
from the club, y'all don't mind do you?

21:38.705 --> 21:40.760
- Oh nah, nah, they don't
go to work til 10, right?

21:40.760 --> 21:42.843
Yeah, they can come over.

21:44.391 --> 21:46.242
- What is this?

21:46.242 --> 21:48.024
Y'all got a dead zone
in here or something?

21:48.024 --> 21:50.540
I have no reception, no bars.

21:50.540 --> 21:52.149
- I'm sorry, yeah,

21:52.149 --> 21:54.862
you can't get no good
cellphone reception in here.

21:54.862 --> 21:57.351
Yeah, you probably have to step outside.

21:57.351 --> 21:59.263
- And that might not help either.

21:59.263 --> 22:01.664
This apartment is so close
to electrical transformers

22:01.664 --> 22:06.472
on that light pole that it
may block all reception.

22:06.472 --> 22:07.305
- Okay.

22:08.241 --> 22:10.230
Y'all got a house phone?

22:14.637 --> 22:16.165
- What?

22:16.165 --> 22:17.968
- Are you not gonna say something?

22:17.968 --> 22:19.385
- Say what?

22:20.578 --> 22:23.055
- You're cool list now, alright.

22:23.055 --> 22:24.753
Deb, let's go.

22:24.753 --> 22:26.086
- What, come on.

22:26.998 --> 22:30.770
Look, look, look, I'm
sorry, alright, I'm sorry

22:30.770 --> 22:32.176
but you know how Peaches is.

22:32.176 --> 22:33.843
- You know how I am.

22:34.877 --> 22:37.151
I've changed my life and I
don't go for this foolishness.

22:37.151 --> 22:38.680
I mean I will not be a part of

22:38.680 --> 22:41.585
or the company of confusion.

22:41.585 --> 22:42.985
Y'all wanna drink and have a good time,

22:42.985 --> 22:44.457
knock yourself out but I'm not interested.

22:44.457 --> 22:47.114
- Okay baby, listen, listen, listen.

22:47.114 --> 22:49.014
These people are my neighbors

22:49.014 --> 22:51.847
but you are my lady, okay, please?

22:53.173 --> 22:54.298
- Stop.

22:54.298 --> 22:55.378
You know I can't resist that.

22:55.378 --> 22:57.211
It's a serious moment.

22:58.271 --> 23:00.336
- Please, baby, baby, please.

23:00.336 --> 23:01.711
- Spike Lee you're not.

23:01.711 --> 23:03.036
- No, but I'm working on it.

23:03.036 --> 23:04.560
- Yeah, whatever.

23:04.560 --> 23:05.545
- What's that?

23:05.545 --> 23:08.513
- Boy, you are a true fool.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.046
KD, man, where the other
deck tapes for this thing at?

23:11.046 --> 23:12.620
- I have no idea.

23:12.620 --> 23:14.658
- Well have you seen 'em around anywhere?

23:14.658 --> 23:16.075
- What does I have no idea mean

23:16.075 --> 23:17.793
besides I have no idea.

23:17.793 --> 23:20.388
Check the hall closet.

23:20.388 --> 23:21.877
- Okay.

23:21.877 --> 23:25.099
You know, you done got a
case of the slick mouth,

23:25.099 --> 23:27.432
got all these people around.

23:28.383 --> 23:32.179
But don't worry about it,
I know where you stay.

23:32.179 --> 23:34.846
You got to go to sleep sometime.

23:36.720 --> 23:39.846
There's something wrong with you.

23:39.846 --> 23:41.616
- So what do you want me to do?

23:41.616 --> 23:44.581
- Oh, just talk about yourself.

23:44.581 --> 23:46.648
- Just talk about myself?

23:46.648 --> 23:47.829
Boy, don't play with me.

23:47.829 --> 23:48.775
You didn't bring me all the way

23:48.775 --> 23:50.662
up in your bedroom just
to talk about myself.

23:50.662 --> 23:52.323
I could have talked about
myself on the couch.

23:52.323 --> 23:53.644
- Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

23:53.644 --> 23:55.863
It ain't like that, I have a girlfriend.

23:55.863 --> 23:58.372
- Oh, okay, is she here?

23:58.372 --> 23:59.864
- What?

23:59.864 --> 24:01.675
- Nigga, did I stutter?

24:01.675 --> 24:03.202
Is she here?

24:03.202 --> 24:05.869
- Nah, but what that mean?

24:06.713 --> 24:09.301
- Exactly, it don't mean nothing

24:09.301 --> 24:11.244
so why don't you put that camera down

24:11.244 --> 24:13.994
and really come and interview me.

24:14.893 --> 24:16.643
- Oh, oh, okay.

24:18.775 --> 24:20.603
- Oh, I wish a cracker would.

24:20.603 --> 24:22.849
I wish a cracker would
try to hurt this man.

24:22.849 --> 24:23.867
I wish they would.

24:23.867 --> 24:25.520
A nigga would tear this country up

24:25.520 --> 24:26.668
you know what I'm saying?

24:26.668 --> 24:28.195
If they try to hurt this man,

24:28.195 --> 24:30.213
they think them fools out there tripping?

24:30.213 --> 24:32.016
They think they out there acting a fool?

24:32.016 --> 24:34.070
Let them try to hurt
this man or his family

24:34.070 --> 24:35.758
and it's gonna be some smoke in the city.

24:35.758 --> 24:37.035
It's gonna be a misunderstanding

24:37.035 --> 24:38.688
in United States of America.

24:38.688 --> 24:40.832
- Girl what is you gonna
do if something jump off?

24:40.832 --> 24:41.848
Nothing.

24:41.848 --> 24:42.756
- Who ain't gonna do nothing?

24:42.756 --> 24:43.699
- You ain't gonna do nothing.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.351
- You must not know about me.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.376
You must not know about me.

24:47.376 --> 24:48.592
Peaches ain't always that sweet,

24:48.592 --> 24:50.528
I'ma tell you that right now.

24:52.386 --> 24:53.920
- What in the world with them?

24:53.920 --> 24:55.487
- Just some fools
out there being ignorant,

24:55.487 --> 24:56.774
shooting up in the air.

24:56.774 --> 24:58.837
- Oh, Peaches, look, another state.

24:58.837 --> 25:00.431
- Oh my God, I
think he's gonna do it.

25:00.431 --> 25:01.389
- Man, he ain't gonna do jack.

25:01.389 --> 25:02.881
- Hey hold on, hold on man.

25:02.881 --> 25:04.323
Watch your mouthpiece, bruh.

25:04.323 --> 25:06.020
Don't be bringing that
pessimism up in here.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.752
What you bring that
pessimism up in here for?

25:07.752 --> 25:10.593
- I put no faith in
this, in the government,

25:10.593 --> 25:11.789
and that's a man.

25:11.789 --> 25:13.859
I don't put no faith in no man, bruh.

25:13.859 --> 25:15.301
KD had a point when he
said you gonna wake up

25:15.301 --> 25:17.675
the next day after the election
and nothing gonna change.

25:17.675 --> 25:19.453
You just gonna go to
work and pay the bills

25:19.453 --> 25:20.773
just like everybody else.

25:20.773 --> 25:22.294
He's a man.

25:22.294 --> 25:24.785
A leader, I'll give him that, but a man

25:24.785 --> 25:26.690
just like you and me.

25:26.690 --> 25:27.702
What you think, gonna snap his fingers

25:27.702 --> 25:29.356
and everything gonna be okay?

25:29.356 --> 25:31.004
I bet you any money if they
put that brother in office

25:31.004 --> 25:32.777
they gonna expect him to do everything

25:32.777 --> 25:35.051
and make it alright but
it ain't gonna happen.

25:35.051 --> 25:36.373
You know why?

25:36.373 --> 25:37.904
'Cause anything that mess up in the world,

25:37.904 --> 25:39.688
they gonna blame it on him.

25:39.688 --> 25:42.202
If it rain too hard it's his fault.

25:42.202 --> 25:44.909
If your wife leave you, it's his fault.

25:44.909 --> 25:46.645
If you scratch your ass

25:46.645 --> 25:49.945
'cause you ain't cleaning
good enough, it's his fault.

25:49.945 --> 25:52.429
I already see it coming.

25:52.429 --> 25:54.201
- What if he is the antichrist?

25:54.201 --> 25:55.356
- Fuck!

25:58.758 --> 26:00.319
- Nah, nah, nah, you done said that twice.

26:00.319 --> 26:01.152
I wanna hear what you got to say.

26:01.152 --> 26:02.677
Go ahead, talk the talk.

26:02.677 --> 26:04.177
- I'm just saying.

26:06.261 --> 26:10.121
Everybody says that
these are the last days.

26:10.121 --> 26:11.689
It's been predicted that the Earth

26:11.689 --> 26:15.067
will be destroyed in 2012, Nostradamus.

26:15.067 --> 26:17.485
- Who is a false prophet.

26:17.485 --> 26:19.014
- Scientists and other historians

26:19.014 --> 26:21.560
talk about us being in the end times

26:21.560 --> 26:24.750
and then all of a sudden, he comes along.

26:24.750 --> 26:28.800
I mean really, is it really
just all coincidence?

26:28.800 --> 26:29.915
That's what they said.

26:29.915 --> 26:32.360
- Well how you feel about that?

26:32.360 --> 26:33.919
- I just told you how I feel.

26:33.919 --> 26:36.432
- No, no, tell us what you really believe.

26:36.432 --> 26:39.512
Tell us how you feel about that.

26:39.512 --> 26:42.831
- I believe that where
there's smoke, there's fire.

26:42.831 --> 26:44.164
- There's in it.

26:45.232 --> 26:47.268
- There's fire.

26:47.268 --> 26:49.934
I read my bible, I know about the rapture.

26:49.934 --> 26:51.434
- Do you?

26:52.385 --> 26:53.824
- Yes I do.

26:53.824 --> 26:57.617
I know about the six seals
and the mark of the devil.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.100
It's like a barcode they're gonna put

26:59.100 --> 27:02.113
on your forehead or something.

27:02.113 --> 27:06.265
- , it's the seven seals

27:06.265 --> 27:08.432
and the mark of the beast.

27:09.315 --> 27:13.557
See this my problem with
people misquoting the bible.

27:13.557 --> 27:15.807
- This fool said six seals.

27:16.737 --> 27:18.561
Nigga, don't you mean sixth sense?

27:29.136 --> 27:31.411
- I see dead people.

27:45.929 --> 27:46.874
- You busy?

27:46.874 --> 27:47.707
- What?

27:49.014 --> 27:50.397
- Are you busy?

27:50.397 --> 27:53.217
You seem really lost in your work.

27:53.217 --> 27:56.716
- Yeah, I got a lot of work to do.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.144
- What is it that you're working on?

27:59.144 --> 28:01.311
- Public analysis reports.

28:03.723 --> 28:06.750
Can I help you with something?

28:06.750 --> 28:10.417
- I was just, you know,
making conversation.

28:12.403 --> 28:15.653
You seem kind of by yourself over here.

28:16.720 --> 28:17.871
I know how it feel--

28:17.871 --> 28:19.973
- I'm not by myself, okay,
I don't need a friend

28:19.973 --> 28:21.727
or a hug, I need you to
get the hell out of my face

28:21.727 --> 28:22.894
so I can work.

28:31.276 --> 28:32.776
- Who is you, man?

28:34.807 --> 28:37.330
- Y'all having a party in there?

28:37.330 --> 28:39.601
- I said who is you, dog?

28:39.601 --> 28:42.483
- Yeah, y'all got chicken in there?

28:42.483 --> 28:43.316
- Nigga.

28:44.710 --> 28:46.960
KD, man, you know this cat?

28:48.957 --> 28:50.815
- Look man, this is a private party.

28:50.815 --> 28:51.840
- Can't come to the party?

28:51.840 --> 28:52.673
- No.

28:55.288 --> 28:56.121
- You sure.

28:56.121 --> 28:57.412
- The fuck is wrong with you?

28:57.412 --> 28:59.444
- Hold on bruh, hey,
we got a problem here?

28:59.444 --> 29:01.685
Do we have a problem here?

29:01.685 --> 29:02.859
Is there a problem?

29:02.859 --> 29:03.852
- It's not a problem.

29:03.852 --> 29:05.233
- Alright then.

29:05.233 --> 29:08.143
- Hey, but y'all be safe in there.

29:08.143 --> 29:10.465
- Yeah, we'll be safe, go on man.

29:10.465 --> 29:11.391
- Don't worry about that man.

29:11.391 --> 29:12.426
They just trying to get in here

29:12.426 --> 29:15.985
'cause of all these females in here.

29:15.985 --> 29:17.304
Hey, hold on man.

29:17.304 --> 29:19.406
You brought some real fire in here?

29:19.406 --> 29:20.695
- No, I stole the remote control.

29:20.695 --> 29:22.158
No, but they ain't know that though.

29:22.158 --> 29:23.018
It's the way you bring it to 'em.

29:23.018 --> 29:23.929
It's the approach.

29:23.929 --> 29:25.112
You gotta run up on 'em.

29:25.112 --> 29:26.932
- Hey, but you know KD
do got that real cutter

29:26.932 --> 29:30.042
in his briefcase, he don't
think I know but he do got it.

29:30.042 --> 29:31.856
- Well if he got it up
there, he gotta bring it out,

29:31.856 --> 29:32.689
we gotta use it.

29:32.689 --> 29:33.764
Hopefully it won't go that far though.

29:33.764 --> 29:37.264
- Come on now, it's a party, it's a party.

29:44.644 --> 29:47.311
- Look, Deb, don't be mad, okay?

29:49.489 --> 29:51.351
- Why would I be mad?

29:51.351 --> 29:54.156
My best friend embarrasses
the hell out of me

29:54.156 --> 29:56.385
in front of a whole group of people.

29:56.385 --> 29:58.418
Why would I possibly be mad about that?

29:58.418 --> 30:01.488
- Deb, I am your friend and you know that

30:01.488 --> 30:03.259
but I know you and what you're doing

30:03.259 --> 30:05.185
and you don't have to
try to impress anybody.

30:05.185 --> 30:06.473
- Impress somebody?

30:06.473 --> 30:09.565
Who am I trying to impress, Inez?

30:09.565 --> 30:11.148
- Excuse me, y'all.

30:12.090 --> 30:13.914
- Who am I trying to impress?

30:13.914 --> 30:14.880
- You know what, forget
it, don't worry about it.

30:14.880 --> 30:17.693
- No, you my friend, tell me.

30:17.693 --> 30:19.711
Who am I trying to impress?

30:19.711 --> 30:21.410
Is it because I'm not as perfect as you

30:21.410 --> 30:24.903
that you think I'm trying
to impress somebody?

30:24.903 --> 30:26.336
- What did you just say?

30:26.336 --> 30:29.176
- I said because you
act like you so perfect

30:29.176 --> 30:31.049
and since I don't act like you

30:31.049 --> 30:33.590
then I'm trying to impress somebody?

30:33.590 --> 30:35.406
- That's twice she said that.

30:35.406 --> 30:38.566
- If you don't mind, this
is an A, B conversation.

30:38.566 --> 30:39.899
A, B, thank you.

30:42.197 --> 30:43.476
Deb, and you've been drinking

30:43.476 --> 30:45.950
so we can talk about this later.

30:45.950 --> 30:48.553
- Wait a minute, wait
a minute, mother may I.

30:48.553 --> 30:49.540
I don't know what your problem is.

30:49.540 --> 30:50.411
I didn't do nothing to you

30:50.411 --> 30:51.604
so don't raise your voice at me.

30:51.604 --> 30:55.215
- Be sure that when I
raise my voice at you

30:55.215 --> 30:56.081
you'll know it.

30:56.081 --> 30:57.861
- Look who puffing they chest up.

30:57.861 --> 30:59.826
Look, boo, I ain't the one, okay?

30:59.826 --> 31:01.811
So go over there, get your praying on,

31:01.811 --> 31:03.874
whatever it is you do,
get all on your knees,

31:03.874 --> 31:07.158
your bible,
do all that and stay

31:07.158 --> 31:08.559
out of grown folks business.

31:08.559 --> 31:10.492
- You recognize my face from somewhere?

31:10.492 --> 31:12.047
Maybe your hood.

31:12.047 --> 31:13.263
I come in here nice and easy

31:13.263 --> 31:14.703
and I don't say nothing to you, alright.

31:14.703 --> 31:17.151
Don't mistake the grace
inside of me for weakness.

31:17.151 --> 31:18.144
- Whatever.

31:18.144 --> 31:20.573
Ant, come get your girl,
come get your girl.

31:20.573 --> 31:22.754
- come in here
and don't say nothing

31:22.754 --> 31:25.419
to this woman and she come fast with me.

31:25.419 --> 31:28.037
I think she want me see myself.

31:28.037 --> 31:29.145
- Whatever, whatever.

31:29.145 --> 31:31.244
I hear you talking, mother may I, okay?

31:31.244 --> 31:32.832
But that's all you better do

31:32.832 --> 31:34.667
if you don't wanna get beat down.

31:34.667 --> 31:35.500
- Yo!

31:36.458 --> 31:38.995
Can't you see I'm trying to work?

31:38.995 --> 31:40.309
What don't you people understand

31:40.309 --> 31:42.655
that I'm trying to work in my own home?

31:42.655 --> 31:44.467
- Hey y'all, the
election's about to come on.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.352
- I don't care, get out of my house.

31:47.352 --> 31:49.055
- You ain't gotta tell me twice.

31:49.055 --> 31:50.398
Whatever y'all.

31:50.398 --> 31:51.590
Next time, bitch.

31:51.590 --> 31:54.007
- Oh, so, Satan get me hands.

31:54.951 --> 31:56.310
Oh, she come in the air.

31:56.310 --> 31:58.378
- Okay baby, okay baby, chill, chill.

31:58.378 --> 32:00.823
Listen, Peaches, look, if you gonna leave,

32:00.823 --> 32:03.046
leave, but don't disrespect
my lady in my house, okay?

32:03.046 --> 32:04.129
- Disrespect?

32:05.193 --> 32:07.216
Don't make me blow up your spot, okay?

32:07.216 --> 32:09.564
Please, don't get embarrassed

32:09.564 --> 32:11.275
and get your girl beat
down in the same night.

32:11.275 --> 32:13.108
- Get out of my house!

32:13.966 --> 32:16.216
- Yo listen, KD, chill man.

32:17.300 --> 32:18.870
- All the polls have closed

32:25.094 --> 32:26.630

32:56.389 --> 32:59.048

32:59.048 --> 33:01.027
The emergency lights
will kick in in a second.

33:01.027 --> 33:02.131
It's gonna be okay.

33:02.131 --> 33:03.458

33:04.577 --> 33:05.486

33:09.071 --> 33:10.161

33:10.161 --> 33:12.883
- Deb, stop that mess.

33:12.883 --> 33:14.816
- It's gonna be okay.

33:14.816 --> 33:17.653
- Just shut up, KD.

33:17.653 --> 33:19.892
- Whoa, yeah, told y'all, no need to fear.

33:19.892 --> 33:20.725
- Told you baby.

33:20.725 --> 33:23.189
It's gonna be alright.

33:23.189 --> 33:24.385
Probably just some fools out there

33:24.385 --> 33:25.759
shooting the transformer out

33:25.759 --> 33:27.332
but we gonna be alright now that we

33:27.332 --> 33:29.783

33:29.783 --> 33:30.816

33:30.816 --> 33:32.204

33:32.204 --> 33:33.308
Where's my keys?

33:33.308 --> 33:35.415
- Girl, I got your keys, I'll go check it.

33:35.415 --> 33:36.415
- Nah, B, B.

33:42.407 --> 33:44.157

33:46.270 --> 33:47.704

33:47.704 --> 33:50.067
- Oh my God, they just shot my girl Davia.

33:50.067 --> 33:51.498
I can't be part.

33:51.498 --> 33:53.410
- Relax, listen, listen!

33:53.410 --> 33:54.840
Alright, now go to the restroom

33:54.840 --> 33:55.831
and get yourself together.

33:55.831 --> 33:57.187
We'll take care of this.

33:57.187 --> 33:59.270
- I told you, I told you.

34:02.938 --> 34:05.211
- Hey Ant, you see something.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.211
- I can't see out there.

34:08.585 --> 34:10.327
- No, no, hey, hey, man, what you doing?

34:10.327 --> 34:11.943
- Ant, get away from the door!

34:11.943 --> 34:12.859
- Carla's out there, dog!

34:12.859 --> 34:14.051
- Hey man, man, look here man.

34:14.051 --> 34:15.239
I ain't saying I'm no punk or nothing

34:15.239 --> 34:16.516
but they got guns out there, bruh.

34:16.516 --> 34:17.679
They got guns.

34:17.679 --> 34:18.512
- I know.

34:18.512 --> 34:19.344
- You can't stop no bullet.

34:19.344 --> 34:20.178
- I know.

34:20.178 --> 34:21.011
- KD the only one with a gun in here

34:21.011 --> 34:22.409
but he ain't gonna let us use it.

34:22.409 --> 34:24.190
- KD,.

34:24.190 --> 34:25.204
- I got it right here.

34:25.204 --> 34:27.317
- Then use it, nigga.

34:30.885 --> 34:32.783
- KD, you have a gun in here?

34:32.783 --> 34:34.005
- I need protection.

34:34.005 --> 34:36.255
- KD, give me the gun, man!

34:37.905 --> 34:39.356
- Wait, just wait.

34:42.877 --> 34:45.137
- What are they doing to him?

34:45.137 --> 34:47.223
- Whooping his ass.

34:47.223 --> 34:48.908
- That man is dead.

34:48.908 --> 34:50.324
- Don't say that.

34:51.509 --> 34:52.380
- Help!

34:52.380 --> 34:53.297
- Sh, wait.

34:56.735 --> 34:58.271
- Help me!

34:58.271 --> 34:59.970
- He's alive.

34:59.970 --> 35:01.887
That's him, he's alive.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.633
You're a doctor.

35:06.532 --> 35:08.899
You have to help him, Ant.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.261
- The hell he does!

35:10.261 --> 35:12.902
- Okay, okay, okay, I'll help him.

35:12.902 --> 35:14.110
Okay, I'll help him.

35:14.110 --> 35:16.930
- No, no, Ant, just hold
on and wait for the police.

35:16.930 --> 35:18.625
- Baby listen.

35:18.625 --> 35:20.270
There's no ambulance that's coming here.

35:20.270 --> 35:22.086
Ain't no police coming
here to save us, okay,

35:22.086 --> 35:24.541
especially if this is
happening all over the city.

35:24.541 --> 35:26.345
I can go up there and stabilize him

35:26.345 --> 35:29.241
just long enough for us to
get help on something, okay?

35:29.241 --> 35:30.519
- Man, that's a bad idea.

35:30.519 --> 35:33.521
- What do you think this is?

35:33.521 --> 35:35.084
What the hell are you thinking?

35:35.084 --> 35:36.617
You run the risk of opening that door

35:36.617 --> 35:38.791
and having those fools run in here?

35:38.791 --> 35:40.304
- Everybody just calm down.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.178
Listen, listen, listen for a second.

35:43.178 --> 35:45.396
See, it's quiet up there now.

35:45.396 --> 35:47.876
I can get out here and go right upstairs.

35:47.876 --> 35:48.709
It's okay.

35:49.759 --> 35:51.592
Baby, it's okay, okay?

35:52.561 --> 35:54.167
Don't worry, Shep will come with me.

35:54.167 --> 35:55.039
- I will?

35:55.039 --> 35:56.313
- Yes you will, stop playing, dog.

35:56.313 --> 35:57.217
Let's go.

35:57.217 --> 35:58.415
- Tripping, man.

35:58.415 --> 35:59.654
Alright, hold up, hold up.

35:59.654 --> 36:02.097
If we gonna do this bruh,
let's do it like this.

36:02.097 --> 36:03.421
If we go out there, we get separated

36:03.421 --> 36:04.533
and there's too many people out there,

36:04.533 --> 36:05.888
promise me you gonna run.

36:05.888 --> 36:06.752
- I ain't gonna run--

36:06.752 --> 36:07.585
- Just promise you gonna run.

36:07.585 --> 36:08.570
You can't save everybody, man.

36:08.570 --> 36:10.987
You're not Superman, alright?

36:11.963 --> 36:13.923
- Okay, okay, alright.

36:13.923 --> 36:14.818
- Give me your word.

36:14.818 --> 36:16.346
- Baby, just--

36:16.346 --> 36:17.966
- Give me your word!

36:17.966 --> 36:19.526
- I give you my word, alright?

36:19.526 --> 36:20.974
- Alright, let's do this on three.

36:20.974 --> 36:22.297
- Alright.

36:22.297 --> 36:23.464
- One, two ...

36:33.340 --> 36:34.423
- I told you.

36:36.356 --> 36:37.773
It's the rapture.

36:38.711 --> 36:41.616
People are disappearing one by one.

36:41.616 --> 36:43.713
- Look, I don't like this.

36:43.713 --> 36:45.068
I think they've been gone for too long.

36:45.068 --> 36:45.901
KD?

36:47.082 --> 36:49.314
We should call the police.

36:49.314 --> 36:50.781
- With what?

36:50.781 --> 36:52.925
A cup and string?

36:52.925 --> 36:54.342
We have no phone!

37:04.780 --> 37:05.933
- Just hold on man, I told y'all--

37:05.933 --> 37:08.045
- Move, move, move.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.670
- Oh my God!

37:16.356 --> 37:18.189
- It's alright.

37:19.390 --> 37:20.585
- I don't wanna die.

37:20.585 --> 37:21.861
- Mr. Rumineski, I'm
gonna take care of you now.

37:21.861 --> 37:22.880
- Did they see you bring him in here?

37:22.880 --> 37:23.892
- What?

37:23.892 --> 37:25.055
- Did they see you bring him in here?

37:25.055 --> 37:26.417
- What are you talking about, KD?

37:26.417 --> 37:29.035
- Look, if they know that
he's in here and he's alive,

37:29.035 --> 37:30.498
they're gonna come in
here and finish the job

37:30.498 --> 37:32.316
and finish us too.

37:32.316 --> 37:33.967
Why would you do that, that was so stupid!

37:33.967 --> 37:35.939
- KD, this man has multiple lacerations

37:35.939 --> 37:37.334
and possible internal bleeding,

37:37.334 --> 37:39.066
if I don't do something
right now, he will die.

37:39.066 --> 37:39.973
Do you understand that?

37:39.973 --> 37:41.262
Them cats are gonna do
whatever they have to do

37:41.262 --> 37:44.112
and I'm gonna do whatever I have to do.

37:44.112 --> 37:45.604
- Please, help me.

37:45.604 --> 37:46.844
- It's gonna be okay,
we're gonna take care of you.

37:46.844 --> 37:48.161
- Ant, listen to your brother, okay?

37:48.161 --> 37:49.401
- Inez, what would you have me do?

37:49.401 --> 37:50.921
Let this man die right here and bleed out

37:50.921 --> 37:52.492
right here on this couch or take him less

37:52.492 --> 37:54.366
than 15 minutes away
where we can save him?

37:54.366 --> 37:55.365
What would you have me do?

37:55.365 --> 37:56.473
- I'd rather you be safe.

37:56.473 --> 37:57.429
- I know, baby, I know.

37:57.429 --> 37:58.722
- Look man, we got a bloody
white man on the couch.

37:58.722 --> 37:59.715
What we gonna do?

37:59.715 --> 38:00.595
- Where's your car?

38:00.595 --> 38:01.428
- It's right outside.

38:01.428 --> 38:02.395
- Okay, come on, come
on, come on, let's go.

38:02.395 --> 38:03.347
We're gonna need somebody to come with us

38:03.347 --> 38:04.265
just to open the door.

38:04.265 --> 38:05.169
- Okay, I will.

38:05.169 --> 38:06.002
- What?

38:07.230 --> 38:08.240
- If these are the last days,

38:08.240 --> 38:10.138
I wanna do something worthwhile.

38:10.138 --> 38:11.994
- Okay, my God, everybody
just stop talking like this

38:11.994 --> 38:14.833
for a minute, just be quiet
and let's think about this.

38:14.833 --> 38:16.322
- Okay, we gonna be alright,
just close the door behind us.

38:16.322 --> 38:17.616
- No, if you insist on
going then I'm going.

38:17.616 --> 38:18.449
Give me the keys.

38:18.449 --> 38:19.282
- No.

38:19.282 --> 38:20.115
- Give me--

38:20.115 --> 38:21.530
- We ain't got no time for this!

38:21.530 --> 38:22.921
- Come on bruh, let's get him.

38:22.921 --> 38:24.336
On my count.

38:24.336 --> 38:25.654
Ready, let's go.

38:25.654 --> 38:26.987
One, two, three.

38:28.866 --> 38:30.047
Get the door, get the door, get the door.

38:30.047 --> 38:31.714
- Get the door, man!

38:38.853 --> 38:40.262
- Watch his head!

38:40.262 --> 38:41.544
- Okay, Deb, get in the car.

38:41.544 --> 38:43.790
Get in the car, Deb.

38:43.790 --> 38:45.373
- What y'all doing?

38:46.639 --> 38:48.007
I said what y'all doing?

38:48.007 --> 38:49.695
- Dude, back up, just back up alright.

38:52.520 --> 38:54.992
- Hey man, we got a problem here?

38:54.992 --> 38:56.855
Do we got a problem here?

38:56.855 --> 38:58.715
- Y'all gonna shoot somebody.

38:58.715 --> 39:02.328
You gonna shoot somebody
over that cracker?

39:02.328 --> 39:05.245
- You better back your ass up, man.

39:23.479 --> 39:25.463
- Mr. Romineski, stay with me, okay?

39:25.463 --> 39:26.830
Keep breathing, keep
breathing, that's right.

39:26.830 --> 39:28.894
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

39:28.894 --> 39:29.912
Can you see the route?

39:29.912 --> 39:31.051
- Nah I can't see, man,
don't worry about me.

39:31.051 --> 39:32.884
Just take care of him.

39:34.203 --> 39:35.895
- Come on, Mr. Romineski.

39:35.895 --> 39:37.095
Come on, stay with me, stay with me.

39:37.095 --> 39:38.920
You can do it, yeah,

39:38.920 --> 39:40.259
Breathe, breathe.

39:40.259 --> 39:41.342
- Is he okay?

39:42.405 --> 39:43.694
- You know what, I'm
gonna double back man.

39:43.694 --> 39:44.681
They had those emergency lights

39:44.681 --> 39:47.714
and then I could see to get to 95.

39:47.714 --> 39:48.547
- What?

39:48.547 --> 39:49.406
- I gotta turn around.

39:49.406 --> 39:50.645
- No, don't turn around,
man, what are you doing?

39:50.645 --> 39:52.683
- I can't see up here,
man, I gotta turn around.

39:52.683 --> 39:53.851
There was some lights back there.

39:53.851 --> 39:55.189
I can go that way to get to 95.

39:55.189 --> 39:57.685
- Shep, listen to Ant, don't turn around.

39:57.685 --> 39:59.754
- I'm turning around, Deb.

39:59.754 --> 40:01.504
- What are you doing?

40:04.868 --> 40:05.701
Shit.

40:12.161 --> 40:12.994
Shit.

40:15.838 --> 40:17.122
It's the same guy.

40:21.747 --> 40:25.315
- Hand me the stick back there, man.

40:33.107 --> 40:35.857
Hey man, get your ass off my car.

40:37.460 --> 40:38.293
- Shep!

41:08.157 --> 41:09.407
- Ant, come on!

41:24.312 --> 41:25.517
- You see 'em, KD?

41:25.517 --> 41:26.881
- Nah.

41:26.881 --> 41:29.334
- So what do you see?

41:29.334 --> 41:30.917
- I don't see them.

41:32.277 --> 41:33.527
I see darkness.

41:36.758 --> 41:38.287
You stop moving around so much?

41:38.287 --> 41:41.870
We don't want them to
know that we in here.

41:55.468 --> 41:56.635
- You alright?

41:57.744 --> 42:00.259
- No, I wanna get out of here.

42:00.259 --> 42:02.116
- They'll be back soon with the cops.

42:02.116 --> 42:03.533
It won't be long.

42:04.534 --> 42:05.729
- I mean this is ridiculous.

42:05.729 --> 42:07.646
What's wrong with them?

42:09.306 --> 42:11.160
I mean I don't know where my girl at.

42:11.160 --> 42:13.328
I'm sitting here scared.

42:13.328 --> 42:14.314
I need to go find her.

42:14.314 --> 42:17.386
- Relax, it's alright,
it's already alright.

42:17.386 --> 42:18.587
- And who
you trying to convince?

42:18.587 --> 42:19.837
Me or yourself?

42:24.685 --> 42:27.518
- You should put some ice on that.

42:29.118 --> 42:29.951
- Damn.

42:34.958 --> 42:36.291
Look, I'm sorry.

42:37.546 --> 42:39.627
- For what, earlier tonight?

42:39.627 --> 42:40.991
Don't worry about it.

42:40.991 --> 42:42.965
- No, I'm not talking about that.

42:42.965 --> 42:44.548
I'm talking about--

42:46.022 --> 42:46.855
- What?

42:48.627 --> 42:50.188
- I wanna go home.

42:50.188 --> 42:52.453
- Peaches, it's alright.

42:52.453 --> 42:55.036
Trust me, it's already alright.

43:13.478 --> 43:14.811
- Fucking idiot!

43:18.783 --> 43:20.283
Fuck is this, huh?

43:23.601 --> 43:27.768
Why am I still here with
this boy babysitting him?

43:36.160 --> 43:39.577
I'm not your mother, I'm not your father.

43:43.208 --> 43:44.875
Why am I still here?

43:47.276 --> 43:48.943
Why am I still here?

44:21.941 --> 44:22.774
Mommy?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.333
Mommy?

44:33.884 --> 44:35.551
- Did you hear that?

44:36.842 --> 44:37.952
That's Davia!

44:37.952 --> 44:39.285
- Peaches, wait.

44:40.326 --> 44:41.821
- Davia!

44:41.821 --> 44:43.154
Stop, let me go!

44:44.590 --> 44:45.423
Let me go!

44:46.596 --> 44:47.957
- Shut up.

44:47.957 --> 44:48.973
- Let her go!

44:48.973 --> 44:50.958
- Yeah, y'all finally
came out the house, huh?

44:50.958 --> 44:51.875
Got yo ass!

45:07.537 --> 45:11.748
- Remember early when we had that argument

45:11.748 --> 45:12.860
and you walked away?

45:12.860 --> 45:13.693
- Yeah.

45:15.868 --> 45:17.810
- That's my move.

45:17.810 --> 45:18.643
- I see.

45:22.722 --> 45:23.586
- Deb!

45:23.586 --> 45:24.700
- Ant!

45:24.700 --> 45:25.734
Get up, they're coming!

45:25.734 --> 45:27.680
- I can't go no more.

45:27.680 --> 45:28.576
I want you to run.

45:28.576 --> 45:29.647
- Hurry, they're coming, they're coming!

45:29.647 --> 45:31.710
- Listen, listen.

45:31.710 --> 45:33.101
I can't go no more.

45:33.101 --> 45:34.014
- What?

45:34.014 --> 45:35.216
- They're gonna find us.

45:35.216 --> 45:37.771
When they come in here,
when they come in here

45:37.771 --> 45:40.172
I'm gonna distract them
long enough for you to run.

45:40.172 --> 45:41.701
Yes, listen to me!

45:41.701 --> 45:44.016
All you have to do is run
about three blocks, okay?

45:44.016 --> 45:45.266
You can make it.

45:45.266 --> 45:47.656
No, listen, look at me,
you're gonna be okay.

45:47.656 --> 45:48.890
You're gonna be okay.

45:48.890 --> 45:52.890
Just run back, it's three
blocks, you're gonna--

45:54.879 --> 45:55.712
Run!

46:00.786 --> 46:04.110
Hey look, man, chill, alright?

46:04.110 --> 46:05.587
- Nah, nigga.

46:05.587 --> 46:07.354
Ain't no chill.

46:24.906 --> 46:25.739
Deb!

46:29.309 --> 46:30.142
- Get her!

47:31.666 --> 47:32.542
- That's them.

47:32.542 --> 47:33.451
- Wait.

47:33.451 --> 47:34.566
- No, KD, that's your brother.

47:34.566 --> 47:35.399
- Hold on.

47:49.441 --> 47:50.941
- Ant, Ant, Ant, okay.

47:50.941 --> 47:52.754
Ant, talk to me, talk to me.

47:52.754 --> 47:55.587
Ant, what happened, what happened?

47:57.377 --> 47:58.660
- There was too many of 'em.

47:58.660 --> 48:00.191
There was too many of 'em.

48:04.573 --> 48:07.406
- Okay, okay, will you just relax.

48:08.349 --> 48:09.942
- Where's she at, where's Deb?

48:09.942 --> 48:11.881
- No, no, no, she's not here.

48:11.881 --> 48:12.759
- She's not here?

48:12.759 --> 48:13.669
- No.

48:13.669 --> 48:15.448
And you left her.

48:15.448 --> 48:18.076
- No, I didn't leave
her, she had, she ran--

48:18.076 --> 48:19.813
- Okay, okay.

48:19.813 --> 48:21.843
She's not here, okay.

48:21.843 --> 48:23.654
- She's out there, I'll get her.

48:23.654 --> 48:24.665
I'll go get her, I promise.

48:24.665 --> 48:26.484
- No, no, no.

48:26.484 --> 48:27.567
- No, no, no.

48:29.302 --> 48:30.368
Look at you, you're bleeding.

48:30.368 --> 48:32.857
You can barely stand up.

48:32.857 --> 48:35.205
Now look, I don't know
what's going on out there

48:35.205 --> 48:38.261
but you are not leaving this apartment

48:38.261 --> 48:41.487
and you know what,
nobody's opening this door.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.716
- That's her.

48:43.716 --> 48:45.543
- We don't know who that is.

48:45.543 --> 48:46.945
Sit down.

48:46.945 --> 48:48.698
- Open the door.

48:48.698 --> 48:50.737
- That's Debra, KD, who else would it be?

48:50.737 --> 48:52.065
- Whoever's been trying to get in here.

48:52.065 --> 48:54.197
- They wouldn't knock.

48:54.197 --> 48:56.272
- Move KD, I'm not playing
with you, open the door.

48:56.272 --> 48:57.991
- I'm not playing with you either.

48:57.991 --> 48:59.516
Now get back.

48:59.516 --> 49:01.301
- KD, they're trying to hurt her.

49:01.301 --> 49:02.541
You saw what they did to your brother.

49:02.541 --> 49:03.611
Just open the door.

49:03.611 --> 49:04.762
- No.

49:06.007 --> 49:08.334
- You heard her, you
heard her, didn't you?

49:08.334 --> 49:09.573
- KD, please!

49:09.573 --> 49:11.309
- Oh my God, they're killing her KD.

49:11.309 --> 49:13.059
- Open the damn door!

49:13.998 --> 49:14.831
Move!

49:17.535 --> 49:18.535
- Oh my God!

49:22.628 --> 49:24.882
- Just relax, just relax.

49:24.882 --> 49:26.817
- KD, are you serious?

49:26.817 --> 49:28.287
You filming this?

49:28.287 --> 49:31.037
Get out of here with that camera!

49:32.863 --> 49:35.696
- She's not breathing, Ant!

49:38.691 --> 49:40.875
Please God, please God,
please God, please.

49:40.875 --> 49:41.792
Please God.

49:45.717 --> 49:47.717
- Eight, nine, 10.

49:51.520 --> 49:54.270
One, two, three, four, five, six,

49:57.042 --> 49:58.125
seven, eight.

50:00.541 --> 50:02.519
- KD, come and get your brother.

50:06.580 --> 50:09.155
Oh God, KD, I told you, I told you.

50:09.155 --> 50:13.322
It's your fault, KD, you
should have opened the door.

50:33.545 --> 50:35.063
- A picnic?

50:35.063 --> 50:38.086
I came out here so y'all
would leave me alone

50:38.086 --> 50:39.364
so I could have a chance to breathe.

50:39.364 --> 50:43.151
Doesn't anybody give
me a chance to breath?

51:04.433 --> 51:07.100
You're crazy, you make me crazy.

51:10.026 --> 51:12.266
Look what you made me do.

51:12.266 --> 51:14.349
Look what you made me do!

51:16.745 --> 51:17.912
- You alright?

51:18.947 --> 51:20.996
- What time is it?

51:20.996 --> 51:23.818
- I lost my watch in the fight.

51:23.818 --> 51:25.937
Gotta be close to dawn.

51:25.937 --> 51:27.687
Close to six o'clock.

51:32.221 --> 51:34.721
- How long have I been asleep?

51:36.580 --> 51:37.413
- Sleep?

51:39.079 --> 51:40.901
You just closed your
eyes a second ago, man.

51:40.901 --> 51:42.484
You weren't asleep.

51:49.397 --> 51:51.064
- Man, I'm tripping.

51:56.188 --> 51:57.188
I saw mommy.

52:01.199 --> 52:05.366
I saw mommy, you, and me at
that park we used to go to

52:10.498 --> 52:14.165
and remember how much
fun we had with mommy.

52:20.492 --> 52:22.742
- KD, mommy killed herself.

52:24.839 --> 52:26.488
She was a very sick
woman that killed herself

52:26.488 --> 52:28.488
when we were very young.

52:30.093 --> 52:32.010
That's what I remember.

52:35.992 --> 52:39.948
At first light we gotta get out of here.

52:39.948 --> 52:41.531
One way or another.

52:43.276 --> 52:46.193
At first light we are leaving here.

52:47.838 --> 52:48.671
- Leaving?

52:50.375 --> 52:52.375
Why do we have to leave?

52:53.340 --> 52:56.539
- KD, there's a dead body in your room.

52:56.539 --> 52:59.326
My best friend is out there beat to death

52:59.326 --> 53:03.016
and if I don't get medical
attention I will die myself.

53:03.016 --> 53:07.183
At first light, one way or
another we are leaving here.

53:11.604 --> 53:14.604
I'm going upstairs to get some rest.

53:15.718 --> 53:17.051
Watch that door.

53:26.398 --> 53:27.512
- You alright?

53:27.512 --> 53:28.429
- I'm fine.

53:30.694 --> 53:32.277
Keep an eye on him.

53:39.771 --> 53:41.021
- KD.

53:42.523 --> 53:43.356
KD.

53:45.783 --> 53:46.783
You alright?

53:48.336 --> 53:49.753
- Yeah, I'm fine.

54:00.840 --> 54:03.923
- This is supposed to be a happy day.

54:04.941 --> 54:05.774
- Yep.

54:08.649 --> 54:10.333
- Think this is the end?

54:10.333 --> 54:11.166
- Yep.

54:17.382 --> 54:21.057
- This is not supposed
to happen like this.

54:21.057 --> 54:24.807
Supposed to have a
business, a house, babies.

54:27.764 --> 54:29.264
Oh God, I'm sorry.

54:50.856 --> 54:51.689
- Peaches.

54:54.791 --> 54:55.624
Peaches.

54:59.894 --> 55:00.727
Lauria.

55:03.599 --> 55:06.182
- How do you know my real name?

55:09.043 --> 55:11.543
- I've always known your name.

55:12.881 --> 55:14.631
I've always seen you.

55:15.667 --> 55:18.917
You never see me, I've always seen you.

55:22.816 --> 55:25.073
- You should have told me.

55:25.073 --> 55:27.573
Day late and a dog short, huh?

55:29.819 --> 55:31.652
- It's never too late.

56:44.190 --> 56:45.023
- What?

56:47.181 --> 56:49.348
KD, what's wrong with you?

56:50.972 --> 56:52.389
- Don't leave me.

56:53.692 --> 56:55.948
You can't say hi to your neighbor?

56:55.948 --> 56:57.159
- KD, get off of me!

56:57.159 --> 56:57.992
Get!

57:11.333 --> 57:12.250
- KD, stop.

57:20.198 --> 57:21.931
- What's the matter, Peaches?

57:21.931 --> 57:24.848
You can't say hi to your neighbors?

57:41.313 --> 57:42.146
Peaches!

57:45.757 --> 57:49.924
What's the matter, you can
say hi to your neighbors?

58:03.541 --> 58:05.874
- I will fear no evil.

58:13.248 --> 58:14.081
- Hi.

58:15.070 --> 58:16.665
You okay?

58:16.665 --> 58:17.748
Are you lost?

58:18.717 --> 58:20.634
Where are your parents?

58:21.846 --> 58:25.114
Don't worry, I'll protect you, alright.

58:25.114 --> 58:28.574
- Leave him alone, he's mine, he's mine.

58:28.574 --> 58:31.741
Leave him alone, he's mine, he's mine!

58:42.139 --> 58:45.472
- You were supposed to protect me.

58:48.043 --> 58:49.325
- Ant.

58:49.325 --> 58:52.158
- You were supposed to protect me.

58:54.883 --> 58:56.550
You let them get me.

59:01.197 --> 59:02.864
You let them get me.

59:04.348 --> 59:05.541
Get me!

59:34.887 --> 59:35.720
- Ant.

59:38.005 --> 59:38.838
Ant.

59:42.635 --> 59:44.099
- Who's that?

59:44.099 --> 59:45.618
What's that?

59:45.618 --> 59:47.701
It's me, KD, hello world!

59:49.588 --> 59:52.104
Or goodbye world, should I say

59:52.104 --> 59:53.841
being that we are wrapping things up here

59:53.841 --> 59:56.940
as a little society and all.

59:56.940 --> 59:59.836
To all of you white folks that said

59:59.836 --> 01:00:03.862
that the black man would
be the death of you,

01:00:03.862 --> 01:00:05.195
well guess what?

01:00:09.253 --> 01:00:10.503
You were right!

01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:13.523
Who's that, what's that?

01:00:13.523 --> 01:00:15.273
I think it's Peaches.

01:01:07.553 --> 01:01:08.720
Say hi, Peach!

01:01:11.778 --> 01:01:14.445
Say hi, Peaches, say it, say hi!

01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:19.077
What's the matter, Peaches?

01:01:19.077 --> 01:01:21.994
You can't say hi to your neighbors?

01:01:27.029 --> 01:01:29.696
Talk that apple bottom shit now.

01:01:38.825 --> 01:01:41.658
You can't say hi to your neighbors?

01:01:41.658 --> 01:01:44.075
Well then you just got to go.

01:01:51.268 --> 01:01:53.147
Come on, Peaches.

01:01:53.147 --> 01:01:54.987
Okay, we gotta go, we gotta go.

01:01:54.987 --> 01:01:57.404
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

01:02:02.978 --> 01:02:06.228
Haven't had much time to talk, Peaches.

01:02:07.301 --> 01:02:09.051
You in black panties.

01:02:10.831 --> 01:02:11.664
So cool.

01:02:12.973 --> 01:02:16.537
Listen, when we get through with all this

01:02:16.537 --> 01:02:20.704
then we can go out to
the park,.

01:02:24.671 --> 01:02:25.981
Take you out for a chicken dinner.

01:02:25.981 --> 01:02:27.564
We can go on swans.

01:02:35.219 --> 01:02:38.552
Apple bottom love in the night, alright.

01:02:43.648 --> 01:02:44.898
And we're back.

01:02:46.235 --> 01:02:47.652
And look at this!

01:02:48.806 --> 01:02:51.056
Wakey, wakey, lemon shakey!

01:02:53.567 --> 01:02:54.400
- KD.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.105
Why are you yelling?

01:02:58.052 --> 01:02:59.169
What happened?
