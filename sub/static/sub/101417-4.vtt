00:13.640 --> 00:17.160
[music grows more intense]

00:24.080 --> 00:27.800
It has long been a dream of mine
to open our home to a child.

00:27.880 --> 00:30.840
To a baby. A girl.
The cutest one you've got.

00:30.920 --> 00:33.800
Well, I'd be overjoyed
to have the child in the most need,

00:33.880 --> 00:36.320
whatever the age or drug problem,

00:36.400 --> 00:39.200
but my daughter is quite specific
about wanting a newborn.

00:39.280 --> 00:40.640
One that looks like me.

00:40.720 --> 00:44.240
Are, um, Christian teens
giving their babies away anymore or--

00:44.320 --> 00:46.120
<i>Placing </i>their babies for adoption.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.240
Placing, right.

00:47.720 --> 00:50.600
Because we're so close to Ireland,
so I was hoping that...

00:50.680 --> 00:54.000
You know, like when unmarried teens
would disappear on holiday,

00:54.080 --> 00:56.680
as not to bring shame
upon the Catholic family...

00:56.760 --> 01:00.760
When fallen women were pressurized
into placing their infants for adoption,

01:01.160 --> 01:04.720
with no access to counseling
or appropriate support?

01:04.800 --> 01:06.800
You were hoping that was still the case?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.480
No. Is it?

01:09.560 --> 01:10.440
No.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.720
It's not as common
now that mothers face less stigma

01:13.800 --> 01:16.320
and, thankfully,
have far more options available.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.840
Oh, that's... Wow. Excellent news.

01:18.920 --> 01:20.520
Good job. That's great to hear.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.040
So how much for a baby?

01:23.120 --> 01:24.640
Babies cannot be bought.

01:24.720 --> 01:26.880
Well, not in this country, anyway.
[laughs quietly]

01:28.120 --> 01:31.560
Your relationship status says single.
How long have you been single for?

01:31.640 --> 01:33.160
Oh, you don't want to bring that up.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.240
-She'll start crying again.
-[Katherine scoffs]

01:35.320 --> 01:38.920
No. I've been separated
from Olive's father since she was a baby

01:39.000 --> 01:44.160
and that was my last serious relationship,
so it's been a solid length of time.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.440
That's not true, Mummy. What about Evan?

01:46.520 --> 01:48.360
You moved him in
so that we could be a family

01:48.440 --> 01:51.160
and he broke up with you,
like, two weeks ago?

01:51.240 --> 01:54.480
[laughs awkwardly] No.
This decision is not reactionary.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.760
And then you said "Well, I'll show him,"

01:56.840 --> 01:59.680
and went online
and downloaded the application, remember?

01:59.760 --> 02:00.600
No!

02:00.680 --> 02:03.440
[Katherine] This has always been
the path for me. I'm not upset.

02:03.520 --> 02:05.960
She's been <i>so </i>upset.

02:06.040 --> 02:09.840
So, if you could just get us a baby,
it'd really fix things up around here.

02:10.320 --> 02:13.520
I'll be noting a few things
that concern me in our review, Ms. Ryan.

02:13.600 --> 02:18.200
I've never seen so much pornographic art
on display at a home visit.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.920
Breasts are practically
a baby's favorite thing.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.360
Another reason not to get us a bigger one.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.920
Also, you keep a lot of animals
in the house.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.520
That can be very dangerous and unsanitary.

02:28.600 --> 02:29.920
There aren't that many.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.360
Yet. But we get more all the time.

02:32.760 --> 02:34.840
No. We're not getting more.<i> </i>[chuckles]

02:34.920 --> 02:37.000
-But you said!
-I didn't say that.

02:37.080 --> 02:39.840
You did.
We were looking at Pomeranians online

02:39.920 --> 02:42.680
and you said, when the puppies were born,
we could get one.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.600
Did I? No. No.

02:44.680 --> 02:46.560
Here you are, lying again.

02:46.640 --> 02:47.840
You lie about sex,

02:47.920 --> 02:51.000
you lie about boyfriends,
you lie about crying and you're lying now.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.080
What else are you lying about?
Tell the truth.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.840

03:01.320 --> 03:03.800
[sweetly] Thank you so much for your time.

03:04.520 --> 03:06.480
I'm not sure we can recommend you.

03:07.040 --> 03:10.480
As you know, we reached out to Olive's
school as part of the sibling report.

03:10.560 --> 03:12.320
She has some behavioral issues.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.080
[cynically] Olive?
No, there must be some mistake.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.360
I'm afraid she's quite out of control.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.400
Are you in regular communication
with her teachers?

03:20.480 --> 03:23.600
Are you in regular communication
with my dick?

03:24.160 --> 03:26.720
I hope I'm not out of line here,
but fuck you in the face.

03:27.120 --> 03:29.000
My dogs are groomed every two weeks

03:29.080 --> 03:32.360
and I've never seen them look as clean as
they did next to your crusty fingernails.

03:32.760 --> 03:34.640
It's called self-care. Get a manicure.

03:34.720 --> 03:36.480
Adoption was only my last resort anyway,

03:36.560 --> 03:39.000
since sperm donors creep me out
and my ex doesn't trust doctors,

03:39.080 --> 03:41.560
so I tried to bang him for real
and it scared off my boyfriend.

03:41.640 --> 03:43.680
Yeah. I'm dealing with that.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.480
Then you insult my child and me
in our own home?

03:46.560 --> 03:49.680
So, eat a dick,
I'll stick with the kid I've got

03:49.760 --> 03:51.760

your secondhand crack babies.

03:51.840 --> 03:53.800

"The smartest thing to ever
come out of your mouth was a penis."

04:12.680 --> 04:15.280
"Your mama's so ugly,
smacking her would be animal abuse."

04:15.360 --> 04:17.240
I must say, it's been a long time

04:17.320 --> 04:20.480
since a "your mama" related incident
has been brought to my attention.

04:21.080 --> 04:24.640
I think Olive and Millie
may have been influenced

04:24.720 --> 04:27.040
to hurl these vile insults
upon the other children.

04:27.120 --> 04:30.160
Perhaps by someone older,
perhaps... at home.

04:30.640 --> 04:32.920
Jane? Are you gonna carry on
with this wholesome facade

04:33.000 --> 04:35.120
or are you gonna tell us
what's really going on at home?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.400
Hang on a minute.

04:36.480 --> 04:38.880
Millie may have a fiery spirit,

04:38.960 --> 04:44.440
but I have never heard her use
such sophisticated and hurtful language.

04:44.520 --> 04:48.840
"Your only chance of getting laid
is to crawl up a chicken's butt and wait."

04:49.720 --> 04:52.320
"If laughter's the best medicine,
your face could cure AIDS."

04:52.440 --> 04:55.600
I mean, I was unaware
that Millie even knew about AIDS.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.640
Where could she be getting this?

04:57.720 --> 05:02.280
Excuse me, why am I even here? Olive and
Millie have been hanging around together,

05:02.360 --> 05:04.360
but it wasn't my daughter
saying this shit.

05:04.440 --> 05:07.240
Here's what I think's going on.
This new alliance between the girls

05:07.320 --> 05:11.800
seems to have hatched a dynamic whereby
Olive is feeding Millie the lines to say

05:11.880 --> 05:16.440
and taking a supervisory role,
while other children are verbally abused.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.440
[sighs]

05:18.200 --> 05:20.160
Do you know whose fault this really is?

05:21.280 --> 05:22.640
Jane's. Yeah.

05:22.720 --> 05:26.640
I begged you, Jane, to sort that child out
and then I pushed Olive to be her friend,

05:26.720 --> 05:27.880
just to keep the peace.

05:27.960 --> 05:32.040
Ranking the entire classroom
from hottest to thottest

05:32.120 --> 05:33.880
isn't what I would call keeping the peace.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.640
-No.
-Thottest?

05:35.720 --> 05:39.120
Yeah. It's an acronym.
"That ho over there." It's a thot.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.480
It's like a thirstier type of slut.

05:41.560 --> 05:42.520
Hmm.

05:42.600 --> 05:45.160

When I'm sad, that's private.
You can't tell adoption agents.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.120
And when I make cruel jokes
about the other children,

05:58.200 --> 06:00.120
you can't tell anybody. I trusted you.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.480
Hang on. Millie repeated my jokes
and I'm in trouble.

06:03.560 --> 06:06.160
But I repeated your jokes,
so shouldn't you be the one in trouble?

06:06.240 --> 06:09.680
No, because I said those at home,
in confidence, and I nailed the delivery.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.440
I only tried to make her laugh
to start with

06:11.520 --> 06:14.240
because you said things would be easier
in school if Millie liked me.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.080
Humiliating me in front of the other
parents and your headmaster is not easier.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.360
How am I supposed to be smug
around them now?

06:21.760 --> 06:23.880

what those people think anyway?

06:23.960 --> 06:26.000
You're rude and nasty to them
all the time.

06:26.560 --> 06:29.480
[gasps] How could you say that about me?
I'm your best friend.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.840
Millie is my best friend.

06:31.920 --> 06:34.000

10:08.840 --> 10:09.800
-Nice.
-Thank you.

10:09.880 --> 10:12.360
And then get to marry a loaded woman
in her underwear.

10:12.440 --> 10:13.720
It's not a competition.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.600
But if it was, you've been annihilated.
Wow. [laughs]

10:17.080 --> 10:19.520
Why are you doing this?
He doesn't deserve joy.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.520
Fuck! Why do men fail forwards?

10:21.600 --> 10:25.160
This is bullshit. This is misogyny.
Olive! We're going.

10:25.240 --> 10:26.840
Okay, let me just finish these.

10:27.920 --> 10:30.320
Mmm, Dad,
what did you put in this rib sauce?

10:30.400 --> 10:31.760
The secret's young duck fat.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.360
She seems really hungry. I'm gonna
put some in some foil for you, babe.

She's not at all the sort of woman
I pictured Shep ending up with.

11:04.320 --> 11:05.840
Not inflatable, for a start.

11:07.560 --> 11:09.760
Just give me a ring
when you want Millie to be collected.

11:12.440 --> 11:13.680
Hmm.

I'm not gonna be able to ring you

Weirdly, yes, I do.

11:23.320 --> 11:25.000
Ah, so you do believe in love.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.080
No, I believe in Shep
latching onto an older woman with money

11:28.160 --> 11:30.000
and I believe in that woman being mental.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.640
You know, I believe in the universe.

11:31.720 --> 11:34.080
That's great, Jane.
I believe in practicality.

11:34.680 --> 11:37.440
Take Evan, for example. Of course,
he was always gonna be a problem.

11:37.520 --> 11:38.520
Sure, I miss him.

11:39.200 --> 11:40.240

Especially at night.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.080
The Amish learn to do their own dentistry.
How hard could it be?

11:46.160 --> 11:47.280
I could take online classes.

11:47.360 --> 11:48.440
Oh, babe.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.120
I firmly believe, actually,

11:50.200 --> 11:54.000
that our greatest struggles
can also be our guiding lights.

11:54.080 --> 11:55.440
You should meme that.

11:55.520 --> 11:58.320
Like, for example, when you sent Brian
those nude images of yourself--

11:58.400 --> 12:00.160
You left me no other choice there, Jane.

12:00.240 --> 12:03.000
Right, yes, and, you know,
to begin with, I was... [scoffs]

12:03.080 --> 12:04.720
...really quite cross.

12:04.800 --> 12:09.440
But ultimately, it reminded me
that I've got to keep chasing my man.

12:10.080 --> 12:14.680
I mean, our sex life has been
tremendously more adventurous since then.

12:14.760 --> 12:17.560
Really? What sort of things
are you getting up to then?

12:17.640 --> 12:19.200
Oh, no, have this conversation outside.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.600
Bev, I know you're sex-starved,
but I cannot listen to it.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.880
Oh, no, Bev, what's wrong?

12:23.960 --> 12:26.000
Tom used to be up for it all the time.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.800
Now, he barely wants to touch me.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.600
Oh, it's the constant childcare.
It's emasculated him.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.040
All right, have you teleported here
from the 1940s?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.040
A man's a man.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.840
Jane. Go sit in the garden.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.320
No! She's right. Keeping the home's
been a big change for Tom.

12:39.400 --> 12:41.320
Well, why not give him a night out?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.640
Brian and I do loads of stuff
outside the house.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.640
Yeah, but Tom's just always so knackered.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.160
Well, send the boys over to me.
I'll look after them.

Yep. When you're 18.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.200
But Millie has an Instagram.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.480
Well, Millie, I hope you're uploading
a lot of very clear pictures of your face,

13:03.560 --> 13:06.240
because the Missing Persons division's
gonna need those to find you

by one of your followers.

-No.

by Nazis and weirdos.

You see now what I'm up against?

13:31.760 --> 13:35.120
Oh, I'm sorry, Greta Thunberg. Maybe
you could rally the nation's teenagers

13:35.200 --> 13:38.440
to help you protest against the burning
injustice that you can't have Instagram.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.400

To be honest, Brian has been known
to log in and look at models' feet.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.960
Yeah, he's liked all the pictures
on an account called Hoes' Toes.

but I forgot.

Since Mummy nearly let a dentist
slip through the net.

that you started dating again so soon,

but luckily I'm a very forgiving person.

16:49.480 --> 16:50.320
Why?

after not so much as an apology

into an empty tooth-whitening syringe

20:20.840 --> 20:23.200
-Uh... I don't... I...
-[Shep] Let me recap.

20:23.280 --> 20:25.640
My lady sucked me off,
got you the seed you wanted.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.160
You get another baby
and you get to keep your money.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.160
You have everything you wanted.
You still want the baby, right?

20:32.560 --> 20:34.600
-I don't have to fuck you?
-No.

20:34.680 --> 20:35.760
And I don't have to pay you?

20:35.840 --> 20:37.560
-No.
-And I don't have to name the baby

20:37.640 --> 20:39.840
-something stupid?
-Ethos is a powerful choice.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.080
All right, Sheppy, shh.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.760
Middle name, then.

20:43.560 --> 20:44.480
[Olive] Ready!

20:45.400 --> 20:46.520
Come on, baby.

20:48.760 --> 20:50.480
[Shep] Come on, baby. Let's go!

20:50.560 --> 20:51.600
[Cheryl giggles]

20:52.400 --> 20:54.480
[Cheryl] What's that? A pink booster seat?

20:54.560 --> 20:56.560
-[Shep] Yeah! New Mummy got you that!
-[Cheryl] Yeah!

20:56.640 --> 20:58.320
[Shep] Click it in. You know the rules.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.320
Oh, I'll pop over on Monday
with some more. We'll do lunch.

21:02.240 --> 21:03.160
