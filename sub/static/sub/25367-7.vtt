"The Affair"...

00:05.555 --> 00:07.911
Mr. Solloway,
you, uh, got a second?

00:07.988 --> 00:10.349
- What's up?
- I was, um, wondering if you

00:10.426 --> 00:12.840
could take a look at this other
thing I've been working on.

00:12.917 --> 00:15.207
- You reapplying to Princeton?
- Maybe. I don't... I don't know.

00:15.274 --> 00:17.275
Mr. Solloway,
Principal Wilson's on the phone

00:17.342 --> 00:19.323
with the president of the board.
You shouldn't...

00:19.400 --> 00:21.436
- Are you firing me?
- What-what's going on?

00:21.513 --> 00:23.493
- Why are you here?
- I thought you should read this.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.342
Don't tell him
I gave it to you.

00:25.419 --> 00:28.726
- I owe you an apology.
- No, no, I-I barged in.

00:28.803 --> 00:31.497
- So, you still my boss?
- I'm on probation.

00:31.574 --> 00:33.910
Next week, I have to
supplicate to the board.

00:33.987 --> 00:35.539
Thank you for this.

00:35.616 --> 00:38.331
I'll read it over
and figure out what to do.

00:38.408 --> 00:40.481
I'm happy
to brainstorm with you.

00:42.283 --> 00:43.534
Forgot my history book.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.826
I got my quiz tomorrow, and...

00:45.903 --> 00:47.956
- Mom?
- We were just, um,

00:48.033 --> 00:49.368
discussing your
Princeton essay.

00:49.445 --> 00:51.165
- You showed her?
- Princeton? Again?

00:51.242 --> 00:52.544
He wants
to go to the school.

00:52.611 --> 00:53.785
We made a decision.

00:53.862 --> 00:55.451
Just read the damn thing!

00:55.528 --> 00:58.456
Nellie, let's just admit
what this is actually about.

00:58.533 --> 01:00.618
You were never gonna let him
stay here for school.

01:00.695 --> 01:03.122
No one drives
all the way across the country

01:03.199 --> 01:04.789
just to see about a surfboard.

01:04.866 --> 01:07.165
Truth is I'm in love
with somebody else.

01:07.242 --> 01:09.660
I'm gonna tell her how I feel.
So I'm going home.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.743
I'm so glad that you guys
moved in here.

01:11.820 --> 01:14.202
The last people had
a very stagnant energy.

01:14.279 --> 01:16.409
But you...
your being is, like...

01:16.486 --> 01:18.497
it's a little...

01:18.574 --> 01:20.368
- It is?
- Yeah, I don't know.

01:20.445 --> 01:22.160
I-I guess we'll find out.

01:22.237 --> 01:24.368
I'm going to die.

01:24.445 --> 01:28.524
And I haven't really
made a single choice

01:28.601 --> 01:30.220
for myself.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.956
I am going
to Joshua Tree.

01:33.033 --> 01:35.630
We go out there a couple times
a year to do a moon circle.

01:35.707 --> 01:37.606
- Do you want to come?
- I totally, totally don't.

01:37.673 --> 01:38.828
- Oh, okay.
- Okay?

01:38.905 --> 01:39.984
Cool.

01:40.061 --> 01:41.868
I have pancreatic cancer.

01:41.945 --> 01:43.252
I am going to die.

01:43.329 --> 01:44.445
What do you want me to do?

01:44.522 --> 01:46.581
I told you,
I want to have a baby.

01:46.658 --> 01:48.660
If you really want
to do something for me,

01:48.737 --> 01:50.564
you can do that.

03:29.598 --> 03:30.937
No. What are
overnight oats?

03:31.014 --> 03:32.563

03:32.640 --> 03:33.651

03:38.137 --> 03:39.417
It's only like
five ingredients.

- Rolled oats, almond milk,

03:41.431 --> 03:44.093
chia seed, peanut butter...

03:44.189 --> 03:45.554
Oh, shit.

03:45.631 --> 03:47.153
Chia seed,
peanut butter,

03:47.230 --> 03:48.731
almond milk...
maple syrup!

03:48.808 --> 03:50.315

a mason jar.

03:50.392 --> 03:51.528

please tell me where
to find the Medjool dates?

03:57.855 --> 03:59.265
Oh. Sorry, sweetheart.

03:59.342 --> 04:00.543
What do you need?

04:02.063 --> 04:04.112
Medjool dates.

04:04.189 --> 04:05.481
I can't find them anywhere.

04:05.558 --> 04:07.988
Sure, sure. Aisle seven.

04:10.022 --> 04:12.107

everything together...

and they're for Vik.

04:55.646 --> 04:58.535
I thought, if I organized them,
he might actually take them.

Homework. Let's go.

05:15.480 --> 05:16.937
- Let's go.
- Hold on.

05:17.014 --> 05:19.130
- No. Come on.
- I'm going.

05:19.207 --> 05:21.951
- You're not going.
- Yes, I am!

05:31.534 --> 05:33.024
Can I talk to you?

05:33.219 --> 05:34.386
What's up?

05:35.557 --> 05:37.963
I took a pregnancy test
this morning.

05:38.990 --> 05:40.720
Why would you do that?

05:41.482 --> 05:42.882
Because I'm late.

05:42.959 --> 05:45.290
We were just at the doctor.
You're not pregnant.

05:45.367 --> 05:47.668
Yeah, I... well,
I know that now. I...

05:47.745 --> 05:49.528
Didn't you hear anything
that Dr. Roper said?

05:49.605 --> 05:50.855
Yeah.

05:50.938 --> 05:53.736
You're entering
menopause, Helen.

05:53.813 --> 05:56.550
That's why your period is late.

05:58.847 --> 06:00.917
You know, things can happen.

06:01.105 --> 06:03.105
It's not impossible.

06:03.498 --> 06:06.178
Janet Jackson was older than me.

06:08.157 --> 06:10.519
Don't you think I'm too young
to be in menopause?

06:11.795 --> 06:13.910
Don't you think
I'm too young to die?

06:18.063 --> 06:19.105
Vik, wait.

06:19.189 --> 06:20.628
Kids, let's go!

06:23.490 --> 06:25.345
I'll make sure
he takes them, Mom.

06:25.810 --> 06:26.857
Thanks, baby.

06:26.934 --> 06:28.439
Bye.

07:02.392 --> 07:03.480
Helen.

07:03.563 --> 07:04.737
Oh, my God,
you scared me.

07:04.814 --> 07:06.361
Hi.

07:08.432 --> 07:09.672
You want some?

07:10.813 --> 07:13.429
Yeah. Sure.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.778
I know you hate California.

07:19.855 --> 07:22.348
You have to admit,
we have better weed.

07:22.537 --> 07:24.315
When did I say
I hated California?

07:24.392 --> 07:25.755
I can just tell.

07:25.832 --> 07:28.653
You're one of those
East Coast snobs

07:28.730 --> 07:31.934
who just loves to act
like you're in exile out here.

07:34.397 --> 07:37.363
Oh, no. Where is that
cookbook your mother wrote?

07:37.725 --> 07:38.898
It's in there.

07:38.975 --> 07:40.663
- Yeah, but which one?
- See, the thing that you

07:40.730 --> 07:42.450
transplants don't understand

07:42.527 --> 07:46.019
is that California is actually
the cradle of civilization.

07:46.096 --> 07:48.809
Uh, actually, I think that's
somewhere in the Middle East.

07:49.022 --> 07:52.345
Yeah, if you're talking
about patriarchal society.

07:52.779 --> 07:55.257
I'm talking about
matriarchal society.

07:55.334 --> 07:57.208
And you think that started here?

07:57.285 --> 07:58.927
Not right here.

07:59.004 --> 08:01.440
About 150 miles east,
in Joshua Tree.

08:01.517 --> 08:02.936
Sierra?

08:03.709 --> 08:06.840
You know nothing you're saying
is true, right?

08:09.605 --> 08:10.940
Such a cynic.

08:13.897 --> 08:15.105
I win.

08:15.303 --> 08:16.355
Oh, wait.

08:16.615 --> 08:17.937
No, I don't.

08:18.014 --> 08:19.271
You know, I wouldn't
have figured you

08:19.338 --> 08:20.957
for a solitaire type of girl.

08:21.108 --> 08:23.286
My mom taught me
when I was a kid

08:23.363 --> 08:26.394
so that I could keep myself
entertained when she was on set.

08:26.706 --> 08:29.446
I didn't really have
many friends my own age.

08:29.806 --> 08:31.629
That's why I'm such an old soul.

08:33.402 --> 08:35.605
No, you're not an old anything.

08:35.826 --> 08:39.136
Helen, I'm gonna
be 30 next year.

08:39.225 --> 08:40.304
Wow.

08:40.381 --> 08:42.488
No, you don't understand.

08:42.607 --> 08:46.397
Thirty is almost, like,
50 in actor years.

08:46.474 --> 08:49.302
Well, I'm almost, like,
50 in people years.

08:49.379 --> 08:51.394
Yeah, but you're still
really fuckable.

08:51.537 --> 08:53.154
I'm never gonna be
that fuckable

08:53.231 --> 08:54.970
when I'm your age.

08:55.412 --> 08:56.970
What time is it?

08:57.154 --> 08:58.403
I don't know.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.023
Alexa, what time is it?

09:00.100 --> 09:02.296
The time is 11:04 a.m.

09:02.373 --> 09:04.504
Oh, shit.
I gotta get an Uber.

09:04.688 --> 09:06.262
Where you going?

09:06.873 --> 09:08.148
To Joshua Tree.

09:08.225 --> 09:09.815
To my women's moon circle.

09:09.892 --> 09:11.296
I invited you, remember?

09:11.373 --> 09:12.862
You kind of spat in my face.

09:13.842 --> 09:15.793
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

09:15.870 --> 09:17.170
It's fine.

09:17.795 --> 09:19.457
It's too bad, though.

09:19.638 --> 09:21.359
I mean, I just had
this intuition

09:21.436 --> 09:23.720
that you really needed
some guidance, but...

09:38.847 --> 09:40.962
What is a moon circle, exactly?

09:42.232 --> 09:44.223
New moons represent beginnings.

09:44.308 --> 09:48.198
It's a time for planting seeds
and setting intentions,

09:48.275 --> 09:52.519
and then committing to behaviors
to help us manifest them.

09:53.006 --> 09:55.117
And I'm really looking
forward to this one,

09:55.194 --> 09:56.685
because Gaelle
is going to be there.

09:56.762 --> 09:57.970
Who's Gaelle?

09:58.388 --> 09:59.690
She's my guru.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.387
She's a healer.

10:01.490 --> 10:03.070
She's a true gift.

10:03.147 --> 10:05.232
I mean, my work with her
has been so transformative,

10:05.309 --> 10:07.191
I don't even see
my therapist anymore.

10:12.303 --> 10:13.975
Fuck it.

10:15.813 --> 10:17.314
I'll go.

10:18.154 --> 10:20.429
- For real?
- For real.

10:21.397 --> 10:23.230
Oh, my God. Awesome.

10:24.439 --> 10:27.322
You sure Vik
won't mind us borrowing his car?

10:27.399 --> 10:31.186
Um, he might, but I don't
particularly care at the moment.

10:33.097 --> 10:35.199
What kind of music
do you like?

10:35.615 --> 10:38.418
Oh, I think probably nothing
that you would like.

10:38.576 --> 10:39.945
Try me.

10:40.623 --> 10:41.690
Uh, I don't know.

10:41.767 --> 10:42.815
I like rock music.

10:42.892 --> 10:44.399
I like some folk music.

10:44.476 --> 10:45.529
Patti Smith?

10:45.606 --> 10:47.186
Uh, sure.

10:48.326 --> 10:50.606
She's my favorite
when I'm super depressed.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.427
Probably listened
to this album

10:52.504 --> 10:54.606
like 500 times
in the past week.

10:54.683 --> 10:57.278
- Why were you super depressed?
- Um...

10:59.597 --> 11:01.996
I fucked a married man.

11:02.980 --> 11:06.335
I'm really annoyed
with myself

11:06.412 --> 11:09.950
because I've done it before,
and it never ends well for me.

11:10.027 --> 11:11.365
I see.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.271
And I even know his wife,

11:14.348 --> 11:15.615
and I...

11:15.938 --> 11:18.324
I really like his wife, so...

11:19.701 --> 11:21.255
it was a stupid thing to do.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.569
Why did you do it?

11:22.646 --> 11:24.565
My mom broke up
like two marriages,

11:24.642 --> 11:28.070
so I guess I just always thought
that's how you vet a man,

11:28.147 --> 11:30.232
like how you know
if he's stable or not.

11:30.309 --> 11:32.629
You mean, if he's married
to someone else?

11:32.712 --> 11:33.828
Yeah, like,

11:33.905 --> 11:34.935
that's how
you can tell

11:35.012 --> 11:36.481
if he's serious
about commitment.

11:36.558 --> 11:38.611
That's what my mom
always said.

11:38.688 --> 11:39.950
You're gonna think
I'm full of it,

11:40.017 --> 11:42.429
but I wish I had your life.

11:43.131 --> 11:44.505
Oh.

11:44.855 --> 11:46.278
No, you don't.

11:46.355 --> 11:47.945
No, I'm serious.

11:48.022 --> 11:50.488
I would so much rather be you.

11:50.936 --> 11:52.636
I mean,
look at my life.

11:52.713 --> 11:54.055
Yeah?

11:54.132 --> 11:57.138
Literally, the only
currency that I have

11:57.215 --> 11:59.546
is my youth

11:59.623 --> 12:02.637
or my sex or whatever.

12:03.409 --> 12:05.742
But you...

12:06.561 --> 12:08.023
you, like, have it all.

12:08.100 --> 12:10.684
No, you're...

12:12.576 --> 12:15.507
You're, like,
this smart, beautiful,

12:15.584 --> 12:16.812
sophisticated woman.

12:16.889 --> 12:18.224
You've made all
the right choices.

12:18.301 --> 12:20.005
You have...

12:20.082 --> 12:21.279
I mean,
you don't have men

12:21.356 --> 12:23.364
chewing you up
and spitting you out.

12:23.441 --> 12:26.512
You have a family
and Vik and...

12:26.803 --> 12:29.570
I mean, you have a whole world
that needs you.

12:29.647 --> 12:32.019
Like, literally
couldn't live without you.

12:33.030 --> 12:34.936
How do I get that?

12:38.364 --> 12:41.563
♪ To build it back again ♪

12:43.980 --> 12:47.621
♪ Build the peaceable kingdom ♪

12:50.189 --> 12:51.272
See?

12:51.355 --> 12:53.012
♪ Back again ♪

12:53.162 --> 12:54.605
Told you.

12:54.803 --> 12:56.036
Pretty great, right?

12:56.113 --> 12:58.606
♪ Build it back again ♪

12:58.683 --> 13:00.314
Come on.

13:02.932 --> 13:05.990
We're gonna miss the
Blessing of the Eagle Feather.

13:11.897 --> 13:16.736
I want you all to take
a big, deep breath.

13:16.813 --> 13:21.694
We've made it to the new moon
in tropical Libra.

13:21.771 --> 13:23.690
We call upon this new moon,
our cosmic mother...

13:23.767 --> 13:24.934
That's Gaelle?

13:25.011 --> 13:26.065
Yeah. Isn't she
wonderful?

13:26.142 --> 13:27.486
You said she was a guru.

13:27.563 --> 13:29.481
- She is.
- Join us...

13:29.558 --> 13:30.604
She's a teenager.

13:30.681 --> 13:31.940
Well, she was
an Incan princess

13:32.017 --> 13:33.528
in a past life.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.565
Help us uncover
our first selves...

13:35.642 --> 13:39.146
I don't care if you don't
believe me. It's true.

13:39.476 --> 13:41.446
We call upon fire...

13:41.523 --> 13:43.565
Is she even allowed
to wear that thing?

13:43.642 --> 13:45.237
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

13:45.314 --> 13:46.876
it's kind of
politically incorrect.

13:46.953 --> 13:48.217
- Shh.
- I mean, how many birds

13:48.294 --> 13:50.107
- had to die to make...
- Okay, Helen. Shh.

13:50.184 --> 13:54.149
Let its great power
transmute our negative,

13:54.226 --> 13:56.178
lower energies.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.731
And help us

13:57.808 --> 13:59.952
move forward into positivity

14:00.029 --> 14:01.351
and light.

14:04.646 --> 14:07.499
For people whose chakras
are particularly blocked,

14:07.576 --> 14:09.587
the sage is very powerful.

14:09.664 --> 14:11.499
I'm allergic to sage.

14:11.576 --> 14:13.373
It's...

14:13.450 --> 14:15.778
It's Helen, right?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.565
- Mm-hmm.
- You're lucky the universe

14:17.642 --> 14:20.304
chose to partner you
with Sierra here.

14:20.687 --> 14:22.217
I've rarely met a sister

14:22.294 --> 14:24.595
whose sacral chakra
is more aligned.

14:52.521 --> 14:54.023
Get a yurt!

15:01.865 --> 15:04.105
Thank you for holding space.

15:04.230 --> 15:08.012
Thank you for receiving light.

15:21.855 --> 15:23.820
Oh, my God, I hate

15:23.897 --> 15:26.716
having to wear clothes
all the time. Don't you?

15:28.147 --> 15:30.606
That's what I love
about being out here.

15:30.683 --> 15:32.315
There's not
a man in sight.

15:32.392 --> 15:35.224
It's so liberating.

15:35.570 --> 15:37.023
Uh...

15:37.100 --> 15:38.690
So, what's the, um...

15:38.767 --> 15:40.493
What's on the, uh...

15:40.570 --> 15:42.285
What are we doing tonight?

15:42.362 --> 15:44.655
Well, I don't know exactly.

15:44.732 --> 15:47.647
Um, with Gaelle,
anything could happen,

15:47.724 --> 15:50.486
but we usually have a banquet,

15:50.563 --> 15:52.458
and then we do the moon circle.

15:52.539 --> 15:53.539
Cool.

15:54.105 --> 15:56.810
Ooh. This...

15:57.265 --> 16:00.421
is for you to wear to dinner.

16:00.498 --> 16:02.966
Oh, uh, do I have to?

16:03.523 --> 16:05.634
Well, no, you don't have to,

16:05.711 --> 16:07.813
but I don't know
how you expect to have

16:07.890 --> 16:09.315
a transformative experience

16:09.392 --> 16:11.512
if you don't at least try
to participate.

16:14.203 --> 16:15.794
What is that?

16:15.875 --> 16:17.335
That's the dinner gong.

16:17.412 --> 16:19.387
Gaelle loves that thing.

16:19.476 --> 16:21.439
So, um...

16:22.101 --> 16:25.677
what's up with the make-out sesh
with you and Gaelle?

16:25.757 --> 16:28.454
Oh. Yeah, there's a little more

16:28.531 --> 16:30.274
to that story
than I initially let on.

16:30.351 --> 16:31.648
Is she your girlfriend?

16:31.725 --> 16:35.665
No. No, I mean,
she's not... not now.

16:35.742 --> 16:38.576
She was, briefly,
for like a second.

16:38.656 --> 16:40.012
So you're bi?

16:40.398 --> 16:42.028
I don't like labels.

16:42.105 --> 16:43.970
Well, no, of course you don't.

16:46.563 --> 16:49.195
Um, I should call Vik
and tell him

16:49.272 --> 16:50.898
I'm not going to be home.

16:50.975 --> 16:52.690
How is Vik?

16:52.767 --> 16:54.563
He's fine.

16:54.646 --> 16:56.315
I just... I-I saw him
the other day,

16:56.392 --> 16:57.898
and he seemed a little tired.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.544
Well, he has a huge job, so...

17:00.625 --> 17:02.362
Hi. It's me.

17:02.439 --> 17:04.582
I'm just calling to say
that I'm not coming home.

17:04.659 --> 17:08.319
Um, and the kids are with Noah,
so you're on your own.

17:08.396 --> 17:12.060
Uh, there's some of your mom's
baingan bharta in the freezer.

17:12.257 --> 17:14.230
Okay. Bye.

17:16.521 --> 17:18.065
Are you really not
gonna wear that?

17:18.142 --> 17:19.845
Because you're gonna be
the only one.

17:21.314 --> 17:22.778
Okay, fine.

17:31.771 --> 17:35.357
So... what about you?

17:35.434 --> 17:38.444
Um, what about me?

17:38.521 --> 17:40.747
Do you only sleep with men?

17:40.898 --> 17:42.554
Um, mostly.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.845
Um, say more.

17:51.314 --> 17:54.237
I forgot to tell you
about the pièce de résistance.

17:54.314 --> 17:56.940
Later tonight, we're going
to a sensory deprivation tank.

17:57.017 --> 17:58.278
A what?

17:58.355 --> 17:59.555
Seriously,
you don't know

17:59.632 --> 18:01.274
what a sensory
deprivation tank is?

18:01.351 --> 18:02.565
- Should I?
- Oh, my God.

18:02.642 --> 18:04.035
Helen, you're
gonna love it.

18:04.112 --> 18:06.399
The water is warmed to
your exact body temperature,

18:06.476 --> 18:08.986
and it's like
this big womb,

18:09.063 --> 18:11.399
and you just kind of float
in this mystical cocoon,

18:11.476 --> 18:13.357
and it's, like,
totally transformative.

18:13.434 --> 18:15.486
You use that word a lot.

18:15.563 --> 18:18.099
Yeah, I'm just
noticing that, too.

18:18.797 --> 18:21.723
Okay, ladies,
hand over your fears

18:21.800 --> 18:23.254
that you wrote down.

18:24.850 --> 18:27.125
Okay.

18:27.727 --> 18:30.133
Okay, do I have a card
from everybody?

18:35.820 --> 18:39.857
Now, the first step
in validating our narratives

18:39.934 --> 18:42.841
is owning what scares us.

18:43.147 --> 18:46.611
As you all know,
a new moon is an ideal time

18:46.688 --> 18:49.315
for clearing psychic debris
that has accumulated

18:49.392 --> 18:51.945
over the previous lunation.

18:52.022 --> 18:55.112
You have all trusted
your current blockages

18:55.189 --> 18:56.440
to this sisterhood.

18:56.517 --> 18:58.403
Now, together, we will

18:58.480 --> 19:00.318
dissolve them with love.

19:02.006 --> 19:03.131
Okay.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.237
- I'm sorry.
- Read it!

19:10.314 --> 19:11.857
What does it say?

19:11.934 --> 19:14.028
- Read it.
- Okay, okay.

19:14.105 --> 19:16.694
"My boyfriend asked me
to try anal with him last week."

19:16.771 --> 19:18.660
And then there's a frowny face

19:18.737 --> 19:21.606
with X's for eyes.

19:21.933 --> 19:24.214
Ladies, suggestions?

19:26.808 --> 19:27.921
Butt plugs.

19:27.998 --> 19:29.540
The glass kind.

19:29.617 --> 19:31.328
They're tiny.
They're not offensive.

19:31.405 --> 19:33.315
I mean, at first, I was like,
"Absolutely not.

19:33.392 --> 19:34.815
No way. Not happening."

19:34.892 --> 19:37.278
But they are
a gateway drug to anal.

19:37.355 --> 19:39.690
What if I don't want
a gateway drug to anal?

19:39.767 --> 19:41.070
Oh, you do.

19:41.147 --> 19:42.731
You should listen to the lady.

19:44.314 --> 19:45.778
Okay.

19:47.392 --> 19:49.694
Next, let's see.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.399
"I am afraid having children

19:51.476 --> 19:54.278
is going to steal
my creative spirit.

19:54.355 --> 19:56.653
I still have so much
I want to accomplish.

19:56.730 --> 19:58.357
What if I wake up
an old woman

19:58.434 --> 20:00.773
and realize I gave up
all my energy

20:00.850 --> 20:02.565
to my children?"

20:02.642 --> 20:05.105
Fuck.

20:05.189 --> 20:07.314
That...

20:07.397 --> 20:08.980
Anyone?

20:10.980 --> 20:12.189
Okay.

20:12.272 --> 20:14.315
Guys, clearly that's mine.

20:14.392 --> 20:16.355
Um...

20:16.439 --> 20:19.237
I'm, like, freaking out.

20:19.314 --> 20:21.523
Like, seriously, like,
I don't even know...

20:21.600 --> 20:23.444
I'm not prepared for this.

20:23.521 --> 20:25.648
Like, what if this
ruins my life?

20:25.725 --> 20:29.304
Like, I really fucking
like my life, you know?

20:31.242 --> 20:32.606
The answer
already exists

20:32.683 --> 20:34.137
in you, Cass.

20:36.148 --> 20:40.287
It will come if you
let yourself surrender.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.646
I am surrendering.

20:43.077 --> 20:44.653
Surrender more.

20:44.730 --> 20:46.486
Okay, Gaelle,

20:46.563 --> 20:49.153
with all due respect,
you have never been pregnant,

20:49.230 --> 20:51.736
and you have no fucking clue
what this feels like.

20:51.813 --> 20:53.606
- Calm down, Cass!
- Guys, don't fight.

20:53.683 --> 20:55.255
I know what it feels like.

20:56.836 --> 20:58.357
I have four kids.

20:58.434 --> 20:59.731
- Whoa.
- Geez.

21:01.314 --> 21:03.149
And I do... I remember
being terrified

21:03.226 --> 21:04.857
before my first daughter
was born.

21:04.934 --> 21:07.474
My husband said I was acting
like a caged animal.

21:07.551 --> 21:10.365
Yes, that's exactly how I feel.

21:12.695 --> 21:14.220
What do you do?

21:14.530 --> 21:16.785
I'm a designer.
I make furniture.

21:16.862 --> 21:19.130
Ah. I love design.

21:19.828 --> 21:21.304
I used to have a shop.

21:21.437 --> 21:22.480
Where?

21:22.968 --> 21:24.529
In Brooklyn.

21:25.662 --> 21:28.401
- It was a great shop.
- Mmm.

21:28.781 --> 21:31.023
But, you know, um,
I can say this.

21:31.100 --> 21:34.153
Your life is about
to completely change.

21:34.230 --> 21:35.153
- Fuck.
- No, but not

21:35.230 --> 21:36.232
in the way you think.

21:36.309 --> 21:38.399
It-it doesn't get smaller.

21:38.476 --> 21:41.122
It gets larger.

21:41.429 --> 21:42.778
How?

21:42.855 --> 21:46.607
Okay, when... right after I had
my first daughter, Whitney,

21:47.015 --> 21:50.522
I had this moment,
and I remember it very clearly.

21:50.599 --> 21:51.614
I was looking

21:51.691 --> 21:53.820
at her little face,
and, um,

21:53.897 --> 21:57.639
it suddenly occurred to me
that she was going to...

21:57.716 --> 21:59.341
outlive me.

21:59.688 --> 22:01.982
Her life was going
to extend beyond mine,

22:02.059 --> 22:04.927
and I was finite.

22:05.147 --> 22:08.387
You know, really just dust
in the fucking wind.

22:08.655 --> 22:10.898
And so...

22:11.272 --> 22:14.544
I just said to myself,
"Okay, then, if that's true,

22:14.621 --> 22:17.903
what am I going to do
with my one

22:17.980 --> 22:19.880
wild and precious life?"

22:21.688 --> 22:23.095
Mary Oliver.

22:25.272 --> 22:27.576
You guys don't know
Mary Oliver?

22:27.897 --> 22:29.481
Okay, but what
was the answer?

22:29.558 --> 22:30.898
Like, what did you do?

22:30.975 --> 22:32.444
Well, I had
more children.

22:32.521 --> 22:33.898
Oh, that's nice.

22:33.975 --> 22:35.403
But I love being a mother.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.231
And not everybody does,
and that's okay.

22:37.308 --> 22:39.046
I mean, you don't have to give
everything over

22:39.113 --> 22:40.590
- to this little person.
- You just have to make

22:40.657 --> 22:42.463
some room for her. Or him.

22:42.540 --> 22:43.801
It's a girl.

22:46.897 --> 22:48.648
The heart actually does expand.

22:48.725 --> 22:51.403
I-I have no idea how it does it,

22:51.480 --> 22:54.310
but it seems to always be able
to make room for children.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.189
Helen...

22:58.851 --> 23:01.653
I'm passing my guru baton
to you this evening.

23:01.730 --> 23:03.232
Oh, please don't.

23:03.309 --> 23:04.439
I...

23:04.521 --> 23:06.480
I have to.

23:06.563 --> 23:08.440
Tonight belongs to you.

23:14.980 --> 23:16.598
What happens if
my husband loves a baby

23:16.675 --> 23:18.117
- more than he loves me?
- Well, he won't.

23:18.184 --> 23:19.731
And my boyfriend
wants to get pregnant.

23:19.808 --> 23:21.726
I'm not so sure
about him,

23:21.803 --> 23:24.274
but I want to really have a kid,
so should I just do it?

23:24.351 --> 23:25.357
- No.
- No.

23:25.434 --> 23:26.736
Don't do that.

23:26.813 --> 23:28.731
Like, what if I don't
find a man in time?

23:28.808 --> 23:30.481
Should I just do it alone?

23:30.558 --> 23:32.444
You can,
but it's very hard.

23:32.521 --> 23:34.533
But, I mean, that's why you guys
have each other, right?

23:34.600 --> 23:36.012
Why you have this group?

23:37.147 --> 23:39.107
Look, I want to be
honest with you.

23:39.184 --> 23:41.315
No matter how many new moons

23:41.392 --> 23:44.153
or tropical Libras
you circle under,

23:44.230 --> 23:46.606
the only way out of this thing
is through it.

23:46.683 --> 23:51.028
I mean, and you can talk to
astrologers or gurus or shamans,

23:51.105 --> 23:53.028
but the only thing
that really works

23:53.105 --> 23:55.315
is living and making choices
and making mistakes,

23:55.392 --> 23:56.731
and then eventually,

23:56.808 --> 23:58.435
you get old enough...

23:59.467 --> 24:01.956
and you start
to figure shit out.

24:06.855 --> 24:10.387
I thought we were going
to a sensory derivation bank.

24:10.792 --> 24:13.866
A sensory deprivation tank?

24:16.147 --> 24:17.694
What did I say?

24:17.771 --> 24:20.690
I think maybe we should
take that away from you.

24:20.767 --> 24:22.070
Actually, be careful,

24:22.147 --> 24:24.178
'cause sometimes
Gaelle's stuff is laced.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.980
Oh, well.

24:34.813 --> 24:38.744
So, what was your fear
that you wrote on the card?

24:39.302 --> 24:43.667
Um, I couldn't think of one.

24:46.042 --> 24:48.212
Your life is so perfect
that you don't have any fears?

24:49.447 --> 24:51.770
My life is a total
fucking wreck.

24:57.980 --> 25:00.565
I thought I was pregnant
this morning.

25:00.642 --> 25:02.440
Oh, my God. Are you?

25:02.517 --> 25:05.257
No. I'm in menopause.

25:05.492 --> 25:07.034
Oh.

25:07.646 --> 25:09.274
That's a bummer.

25:09.351 --> 25:10.556
Is it?

25:11.786 --> 25:13.735
I don't know. Is it?

25:13.947 --> 25:16.015
I mean, do you want more kids?

25:16.133 --> 25:17.665
You know...

25:18.771 --> 25:21.007
I have four children.

25:22.119 --> 25:24.815
I don't actually want
another baby.

25:24.892 --> 25:28.107
I just... you know,
but Vik wanted it.

25:28.184 --> 25:32.460
And I thought that I
should give that to him.

25:32.938 --> 25:36.127
But this whole day,
I've been thinking about it,

25:36.204 --> 25:39.107
and I've been wondering,
how many of my children

25:39.184 --> 25:41.012
did I want?

25:42.572 --> 25:47.359
Was it for me,
or was it for Noah?

25:47.570 --> 25:48.776
Who's Noah?

25:48.853 --> 25:50.429
My first husband.

25:52.022 --> 25:53.903
I mean, all my life,

25:53.980 --> 25:55.934
I've been feeling...
I don't know how to say this.

25:56.001 --> 25:58.095
I've been feeling needed.

25:58.181 --> 26:01.012
By men, by my children.

26:01.119 --> 26:03.565
You know, I remember when Noah
and I first got together,

26:03.642 --> 26:06.023
his mother had just died,
and-and-and...

26:06.100 --> 26:08.240
I remember how much
he wanted me,

26:08.317 --> 26:12.190
in this kind of really
desperate sort of way.

26:12.267 --> 26:14.232
And he would just, like,
climb into bed with me

26:14.309 --> 26:15.940
and need to fuck me,

26:16.017 --> 26:19.274
to feel, um, connected

26:19.351 --> 26:21.778
or, uh, safe

26:21.855 --> 26:23.778
or cared for.

26:23.855 --> 26:25.565
I don't know, and I-I was...

26:25.642 --> 26:29.778
I was happy to give that
to him when I was young,

26:29.855 --> 26:32.804
because I thought that that's
what I was supposed to do.

26:36.392 --> 26:40.944
And then my children came along,
and they're just all need.

26:41.021 --> 26:43.149
You know, they're like
little, tiny,

26:43.226 --> 26:46.982
little, walking balls of need.

26:47.059 --> 26:51.403
And men... men don't understand.

26:51.480 --> 26:54.288
I mean, they have
this notion of...

26:54.392 --> 26:58.190
of-of what bringing a child
into their lives would mean,

26:58.267 --> 27:01.731
but... but-but they only do
a fraction of the work,

27:01.808 --> 27:05.046
and the rest is, like, up to us.

27:05.572 --> 27:08.507
I think I'm...

27:09.103 --> 27:11.940
I think I'm relieved
to finally be in menopause,

27:12.017 --> 27:14.624
because I will never...

27:15.119 --> 27:17.845
have to make a decision
like that again.

27:18.408 --> 27:21.859
You mean whether or not
to give a man what he wants?

27:25.689 --> 27:27.605
Yes.

27:31.033 --> 27:32.565
Yeah. Fuck.

27:32.642 --> 27:33.642
Yeah.

27:33.855 --> 27:35.928
I think maybe
that's it.

27:40.771 --> 27:42.210
You know why...

27:42.397 --> 27:44.757
You know why I like
having sex with women?

27:45.431 --> 27:47.017
No. Why?

27:47.697 --> 27:51.015
Because I find that sex
with women is just...

27:52.017 --> 27:54.053
so much more intimate.

27:54.603 --> 27:55.771
You know?

27:56.197 --> 27:58.023
Because I can relate
to their struggles,

27:58.100 --> 27:59.835
because they're my struggles.

28:00.658 --> 28:04.842
And so, when I see
a woman there naked

28:04.919 --> 28:09.288
and confident
and hungry for orgasm,

28:10.165 --> 28:12.764
it's like this
primal admiration.

28:14.813 --> 28:16.595
It's very sexy.

28:17.892 --> 28:20.063
And also,

28:20.147 --> 28:22.694
usually with women...

28:22.855 --> 28:26.512
I feel like I have
a lot more control.

28:28.563 --> 28:30.397
And, um...

28:30.480 --> 28:33.512
I don't know,
control is really hot.

Listen, can I give you

Yeah, okay.

29:53.642 --> 29:54.923
Um...

29:56.470 --> 29:58.452
lay off the married guys.

29:59.509 --> 30:00.611
Yeah, I know.

30:00.688 --> 30:02.488
You don't, really,
because you're not married.

30:02.563 --> 30:04.237
You've never been married,
so you couldn't know.

30:04.304 --> 30:05.999
And that's okay, but...

30:07.087 --> 30:09.577
When you sleep
with a married man,

30:09.654 --> 30:13.055
it's not just him.

30:13.189 --> 30:15.648
There's a whole constellation
of people behind him,

30:15.725 --> 30:17.124
and it takes...

30:17.540 --> 30:19.579
years to build trust
in a marriage.

30:19.656 --> 30:22.167
And when you sleep
with someone's husband,

30:22.244 --> 30:23.430
it's not just a moment.

30:23.507 --> 30:25.736
It's years of his life,
and hers,

30:25.813 --> 30:29.023
and the promise they made to
each other and-and their kids,

30:29.105 --> 30:30.882
and it's everything.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.470
And you're just shitting
all over it.

30:35.958 --> 30:37.542
Fuck.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.940
The deprivation tank is here?

30:50.017 --> 30:51.563
Yeah.

30:55.938 --> 30:59.399
I want to have
four kids one day, too.

32:02.063 --> 32:03.886
- Hey.
- No.

32:05.230 --> 32:06.897
Sorry.

32:14.855 --> 32:16.293
Hey, Helen.

32:16.370 --> 32:17.486
There you are.

32:17.563 --> 32:18.940
Oh, my God, I found it.

32:19.017 --> 32:20.023
I found the tank.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.761
Come on. Let's go.

33:51.022 --> 33:52.861
Helen.

33:52.938 --> 33:54.096
Helen, wait.

33:54.173 --> 33:55.976
Where are you going?

34:15.255 --> 34:17.025
Helen.

34:17.242 --> 34:19.089
What are you doing here?
I-I thought you were

34:19.166 --> 34:20.577
in the desert tonight.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.178
What's wrong?

34:27.833 --> 34:28.958
Come here.

34:31.784 --> 34:32.942
What is it?

34:33.018 --> 34:34.926
I don't want you to die.

34:38.438 --> 34:40.344
I don't want to die, either.

35:01.189 --> 35:03.022
Don't die.

35:03.136 --> 35:05.126
Please don't die.

35:08.521 --> 35:10.107
- I won't.
- Promise me.

35:10.184 --> 35:11.611
I promise.

35:15.155 --> 35:16.863
I promise.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.454
- Trevor, straighten up.
- I am.

36:06.521 --> 36:07.867
No, you're not!

36:07.934 --> 36:09.232
Well, I'm trying.

36:09.309 --> 36:10.440
Holy shit, stop!

36:10.517 --> 36:12.134
Brake! Brake!

36:15.726 --> 36:17.554
This sucks.

36:19.206 --> 36:21.038
Come on. I thought
you'd enjoy this.

36:21.115 --> 36:22.103
Why?

36:22.180 --> 36:23.853
Well, your first
driving lesson.

36:23.930 --> 36:26.137
- I don't know.
- This isn't my first.

36:26.214 --> 36:27.694
Vik lets me back Mom's car

36:27.771 --> 36:29.107
out of the driveway
sometimes.

36:29.184 --> 36:30.945
Yeah, I know, but, you know,

36:31.022 --> 36:33.232
here you're learning how
to steer and park and...

36:33.309 --> 36:35.063
Whatever.

36:37.323 --> 36:40.023
Okay, buddy, why don't you
try reversing out?

36:40.100 --> 36:41.508
Are you giving up?

36:41.585 --> 36:43.028
This is pointless.

36:43.105 --> 36:45.535
I can't even take driver's ed
until next year.

36:45.612 --> 36:48.071
Vik and I were gonna
start lessons next summer.

37:08.147 --> 37:09.439
Hey, Trev.

37:11.003 --> 37:14.202
Listen, I-I wanted to talk
to you about something.

37:14.918 --> 37:16.237
Your friend, Brooklyn...

37:16.314 --> 37:17.681
What about him?

37:18.198 --> 37:19.325
Well, I just
wanted you to know

37:19.392 --> 37:23.053
that if there's... if there's
anything you wanted to...

37:23.534 --> 37:25.251
tell me about him or...

37:25.714 --> 37:27.871
Anything at all.

37:28.277 --> 37:31.262
Can we just get Stacey
and go back to Mom's now?

37:31.628 --> 37:32.771
Please.

37:35.097 --> 37:36.097
Of course.

37:45.688 --> 37:47.710
You better not be
heading for the Switch.

37:47.787 --> 37:48.986
It's my day!

37:49.063 --> 37:51.231
Helen!
What did you do with my razor?

37:51.308 --> 37:52.409
Hey, knock it off.

37:52.476 --> 37:53.564
What?

37:53.641 --> 37:55.939
Razor!
It doesn't have a blade.

37:56.016 --> 37:58.640
Well, I threw it away.
It was dull. Oh, hi.

37:58.717 --> 38:01.205
It was only dull because
you shaved your legs with it!

38:01.282 --> 38:04.429
There's more of them
in the top, right-hand drawer.

38:04.902 --> 38:06.918
How was the lesson?

38:06.995 --> 38:09.118
- Can I talk to you?
- Yeah, sure.

38:09.228 --> 38:11.547
You'd lose your mind
if I went into your room!

38:11.624 --> 38:13.116
I didn't go
into your room!

38:13.193 --> 38:15.897
I swear to God,
if you guys don't stop...

38:15.974 --> 38:17.369
You and Vik need
to work with me.

38:17.446 --> 38:19.360
- Work with you?
- I am trying

38:19.488 --> 38:20.813
so hard.

38:21.167 --> 38:22.320
I've upended my life

38:22.397 --> 38:24.158
to follow you here
for Vik's work,

38:24.235 --> 38:25.736
- to be near my kids.
- Yeah, me too.

38:25.813 --> 38:27.117
And you guys
won't meet me halfway.

38:27.184 --> 38:29.056
I don't... What?

38:29.147 --> 38:30.971
This is supposed to be
a partnership, Helen.

38:31.048 --> 38:33.057
We are co-parenting,
and right now,

38:33.134 --> 38:35.134
I am the only one
extending myself.

38:35.683 --> 38:38.391
You won't encourage
the kids to call back.

38:38.874 --> 38:40.905
You roll over my visitation.

38:40.982 --> 38:44.066
Vik is incredibly competitive
with the kids.

38:44.143 --> 38:46.836
I mean, for fuck's sake,
Helen, they are my children.

38:46.972 --> 38:48.354
Not his.

38:48.980 --> 38:51.485
You just need to tell him
to back the fuck up.

38:51.615 --> 38:53.104
He's dying.

38:56.688 --> 38:58.531
Vik has cancer,

38:59.439 --> 39:03.095
and he's going
to die soon, so...

39:05.065 --> 39:06.274
maybe you'll forgive us

39:06.351 --> 39:08.262
if we aren't
at our best right now.

39:11.198 --> 39:12.774
What kind of cancer?

39:12.851 --> 39:14.977
Does it matter?

39:16.204 --> 39:17.611
The kids know?

39:21.767 --> 39:23.321
Oh, God.

39:24.939 --> 39:26.617
You should have told me.

39:27.189 --> 39:28.969
Why would I
have told you?

39:29.189 --> 39:30.580
Because we're friends.

39:30.657 --> 39:32.345
No, we're not.

39:36.096 --> 39:37.803
Jesus, Helen, I...

39:38.029 --> 39:39.520
I'm so sorry.

39:41.213 --> 39:42.671
Look, I-if there's
anything you need,

39:42.748 --> 39:43.748
anything I can do...

39:43.821 --> 39:45.184
I-I can take the kids.

39:45.261 --> 39:47.126
You and Vik
can have some time.

39:48.063 --> 39:50.220
Oh, God, Helen, I...

39:52.688 --> 39:53.822
Sorry. I can also...

39:53.899 --> 39:56.039
I can just give
you guys some space.

39:56.182 --> 39:57.678
That would be great.

39:59.558 --> 40:00.900
Sure.

40:02.143 --> 40:03.338
Thank you.

40:22.521 --> 40:23.648
Hey.

40:23.725 --> 40:25.304
What the fuck?

40:25.825 --> 40:28.124
Sorry. Your-your door was open.

40:28.201 --> 40:30.155
Did I scare you?

40:31.755 --> 40:33.095
No.

40:34.138 --> 40:35.313
It's the hoodie, right?

40:35.390 --> 40:36.940
The hoodie makes me
seem threatening.

40:37.017 --> 40:38.017
Better?

40:38.239 --> 40:39.745
That's not funny.

40:39.919 --> 40:41.095
Yeah, it is.

40:49.386 --> 40:51.886
Well, now that you've
made yourself at home...

40:52.519 --> 40:54.337
want to tell me why you're here?

40:55.189 --> 40:57.178
How do you even
know where I live?

40:57.284 --> 40:59.368
Read through my mom's
personnel files.

40:59.667 --> 41:01.431
I've seen all your pay stubs.

41:03.439 --> 41:06.220
Well, then you should have known
not to eat all my prosciutto.

41:06.511 --> 41:09.040
I'm playing.
I-I White-Paged you, actually.

41:09.628 --> 41:11.032
It's that easy, huh?

41:11.128 --> 41:12.387
That's disturbing.

41:12.464 --> 41:14.212
Yeah, I think you
can get it blocked.

41:18.646 --> 41:20.556
I need your thoughts.

41:22.066 --> 41:23.652
Okay. What about?

41:23.729 --> 41:25.798
On whether or not
I should join the Marines.

41:25.875 --> 41:27.019
What?

41:27.964 --> 41:29.101
What about college?

41:29.178 --> 41:31.582
I need to be my own man,
Mr. Solloway.

41:31.659 --> 41:32.934
I-I can't keep
letting my parents

41:33.001 --> 41:34.440
push me around like this.

41:34.517 --> 41:35.899
It's not right.

41:37.698 --> 41:38.932
Look, I know you and my mom

41:39.009 --> 41:41.001
have something
going on right now.

41:42.116 --> 41:43.853
She can be a real bully.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.198
You should know that.

41:45.275 --> 41:47.282
Yeah, I do know that, Anton.

41:49.230 --> 41:52.354
I also know that she loves you
like a crazy person,

41:52.431 --> 41:54.648
and right now she's having
a hard time letting you go.

41:54.725 --> 41:56.190
And that's normal.
That's not her.

41:56.267 --> 41:58.211
That's just what happens
when the time comes

41:58.288 --> 42:00.126
for kids to
flee the nest.

42:00.521 --> 42:03.178
You'd really rather go to war
than go to college?

42:03.292 --> 42:06.080
Well, they said the chances
of me seeing combat are slim.

42:06.157 --> 42:07.325
Yeah, they're lying.

42:07.402 --> 42:08.482
This country is pretty much

42:08.558 --> 42:11.540
at war somewhere
all the time.

42:11.813 --> 42:14.678
Well, any way I go,

42:14.847 --> 42:17.262
one of them is going
to be disappointed.

42:20.188 --> 42:22.762
Look, you came here.
You want my advice, right?

42:25.646 --> 42:27.678
I really think
you need to see Princeton.

42:27.870 --> 42:29.345
Just see it. Just...

42:29.441 --> 42:31.149
spend some time there.

42:31.338 --> 42:33.565
You have this idea in your head
that it's a terrible place.

42:33.632 --> 42:35.669
Maybe it is,
but maybe you'd like it.

42:35.761 --> 42:37.242
Well, how am I supposed
to pull that off?

42:37.309 --> 42:38.787
It's all the way
across the country.

42:38.941 --> 42:40.112
Your mom will take you there.

42:40.189 --> 42:41.301
No, she won't.

42:41.378 --> 42:43.307
- How do you know?
- I just do.

42:43.384 --> 42:44.946
Have you asked her?

42:48.165 --> 42:49.907
How did you get here?
You drive?

42:49.984 --> 42:51.924
No, I Ubered.
I never get to drive.

42:52.001 --> 42:53.571
I don't have a fucking car.

42:53.761 --> 42:55.028
Okay. Let's go.

42:55.105 --> 42:56.065
Where are we going?

42:56.142 --> 42:57.315
To talk to your mom.

42:57.392 --> 42:58.848
No. I just got here.

42:58.925 --> 43:00.075
She'll kill me
if she finds out

43:00.142 --> 43:01.351
- I came to you.
- Come on.

43:01.428 --> 43:02.881
I'll let you drive.

43:03.313 --> 43:04.804
Down the PCH.

43:20.314 --> 43:23.899
Why can't you rebel
like a normal kid?

43:24.823 --> 43:27.470
Go to Europe for a year.
Date a white girl.

43:27.613 --> 43:29.239
You really want to fuck
with me and your dad?

43:29.306 --> 43:32.112
Do the Peace Corps in some
awful third-world place.

43:32.189 --> 43:34.190
Don't join the fucking Army.

43:34.267 --> 43:36.713
- Marines.
- Boy, I will kill you.

43:36.790 --> 43:38.982
Look, if I go to the Marines,
I won't be a victim.

43:39.059 --> 43:40.315
What are you
talking about?

43:40.392 --> 43:42.315
How is shooting
other brown people

43:42.392 --> 43:44.731
gonna give you agency?
Hear yourself.

43:44.808 --> 43:46.153
No, hear yourself.

43:46.230 --> 43:48.595
It is always about race
and agency with you.

43:48.777 --> 43:50.153
What nine-year-old has

43:50.230 --> 43:51.963
a Black Revolutionary-themed
birthday party?

43:52.040 --> 43:53.901
Fucking Marcus Garvey
on the chocolate cake?

43:53.978 --> 43:55.153
Malcolm X napkins?

43:55.230 --> 43:57.195
- Like, who does that?
- They make those?

43:57.272 --> 43:59.410
Yes. This is what I've had
to deal with my whole life.

43:59.487 --> 44:01.227
- To protect you.
- Look, if I have a target

44:01.304 --> 44:03.212
on my back,
why shouldn't I sign up?

44:03.552 --> 44:05.399
At least then
I'll have a gun.

44:07.103 --> 44:09.235
- What are you doing here?
- Your mother called.

44:09.472 --> 44:11.350
She didn't know where you went.

44:11.427 --> 44:13.752
You can't disappear without
telling her where you're going.

44:13.829 --> 44:15.354
You know that.
She worries.

44:15.431 --> 44:17.220
Why? I'm 19 years old.

44:17.298 --> 44:18.495
Tell him.

44:18.597 --> 44:19.605
Go on.

44:19.688 --> 44:20.982
You're such an adult.
Tell him.

44:21.059 --> 44:22.470
Tell him
what you did.

44:23.756 --> 44:25.773
I talked to a recruiter
about joining the Marines.

44:25.850 --> 44:26.973
You did what?

44:27.050 --> 44:28.481
Uh...

44:28.558 --> 44:29.762
Hi.

44:29.839 --> 44:31.940
Does this motherfucker
live here now?

44:32.017 --> 44:34.104
Look, I-I know
it's not my place...

44:34.181 --> 44:35.486
Oh, you're damn right.

44:35.563 --> 44:36.982
But your kid came to my house

44:37.059 --> 44:38.886
looking for help, so...

44:39.183 --> 44:41.231
I thought maybe we could all
just talk about it.

44:41.308 --> 44:43.088
Who the fuck does
your boyfriend think he is?

44:43.165 --> 44:44.356
He's not my boyfriend.

44:44.433 --> 44:45.922
Reason he wants
to join the Marines

44:45.999 --> 44:48.246
is because he can't
make a decision

44:48.323 --> 44:49.609
about this Princeton thing

44:49.686 --> 44:53.056
because he is terrified
of hurting one of you.

44:53.566 --> 44:55.237
So, what I suggested
was that

44:55.314 --> 44:57.274
somebody should just
take him there.

44:57.480 --> 44:59.399
Let him see the school,
see if he likes it,

44:59.476 --> 45:00.648
make his own decision.

45:00.725 --> 45:01.945
Sounds reasonable to me.

45:02.022 --> 45:03.229
If I go, it'd have to be

45:03.306 --> 45:04.736
- this week.
- Why?

45:04.813 --> 45:07.665
Because I scheduled
to take the GED next Monday.

45:08.402 --> 45:10.973
Anton... in order
to take the GED,

45:11.050 --> 45:12.776
you have to drop out
of high school.

45:12.853 --> 45:15.103
I can't join the Marines
without it.

45:15.253 --> 45:16.945
- Oh, no.
- You have school this week.

45:17.022 --> 45:19.153
Hell no. You're not joining
the fucking military.

45:19.230 --> 45:20.653
Look, I can miss
a couple classes.

45:20.730 --> 45:22.413
I already took these
fucking classes anyway.

45:22.480 --> 45:23.957
Boy, don't talk like that
to your mother.

45:24.024 --> 45:25.325
Why is it,
whenever you're mad at me,

45:25.392 --> 45:26.616
you act like
you're still her man?

45:26.683 --> 45:28.112
- You want to live?
- Oh, Jesus.

45:28.189 --> 45:29.798
Not another word.

45:29.938 --> 45:31.567
Look, Carl, my friend...

45:31.644 --> 45:33.653
Man, why are you
all up in my family?

45:33.730 --> 45:35.056
You don't have your own?

45:35.205 --> 45:36.447
Yeah, I do.

45:36.524 --> 45:38.579
Then what the fuck
you doing here?

45:39.589 --> 45:41.290
Anton, go to your room.

45:41.504 --> 45:42.954
Carl, go home.

45:43.031 --> 45:45.645
Let's... let's just
sleep on this, okay?

45:45.722 --> 45:47.242
We don't have to make
any decisions tonight.

45:47.309 --> 45:48.648
We don't have to do anything.

45:48.725 --> 45:50.694
- It's my decision.
- Okay.

45:50.771 --> 45:53.096
If you want
to go to the school,

45:53.173 --> 45:55.195
I'll take you
this week. I promise.

45:55.272 --> 45:56.846
Janelle, what about
the board meeting?

45:56.923 --> 45:58.075
This is more important.

45:58.152 --> 45:59.252
Janelle, hold up.

45:59.329 --> 46:00.596
We talked about
sending him

46:00.673 --> 46:03.121
to a state school...
Public education.

46:03.198 --> 46:04.176
We agreed on that

46:04.253 --> 46:05.155
when he was a baby.

46:05.232 --> 46:07.735
- Things have changed, Carl.
- No, you've changed.

46:07.812 --> 46:09.754
- Dad, what if I want to go?
- Anton, just be quiet.

46:09.821 --> 46:11.168
Just because you
couldn't make it there

46:11.235 --> 46:12.210
doesn't mean I can't.

46:12.287 --> 46:13.447
Carl!

46:13.524 --> 46:14.646
Hey.

46:16.646 --> 46:18.234
You gonna hit me?

46:18.579 --> 46:19.823
Hit me.

46:20.919 --> 46:22.545
Go ahead.

46:24.246 --> 46:25.371
Carl.

46:31.688 --> 46:33.945
So you a man now.

46:35.569 --> 46:37.559
Okay, be a man.

46:40.619 --> 46:42.469
Go see what it's like.

47:08.029 --> 47:09.895
Hi. It's Whitney.
Leave a message.

47:09.972 --> 47:11.986
Hey, Whit, it's Dad.

47:12.063 --> 47:13.736
Uh, it's super late
where you are.

47:13.813 --> 47:15.767
You're probably asleep,
but I just, uh...

47:15.844 --> 47:17.184
I was just calling to say hi.

47:17.261 --> 47:20.334
Mom keeps me informed
about most things, but, um...

47:20.922 --> 47:22.842
good to hear from you
once in a while.

47:22.980 --> 47:24.709
It's been a while.

47:25.414 --> 47:26.694
Okay. Love you.

47:26.771 --> 47:28.201
Call me if you can.

47:28.278 --> 47:30.236
If you feel like it. Bye.

47:57.774 --> 48:00.345
- Hey.
- Hey.

48:02.755 --> 48:04.179
Can I come in?

48:04.256 --> 48:05.563
Of course.

48:10.480 --> 48:11.605
It's nice.

48:11.688 --> 48:13.189
Thanks.

48:13.272 --> 48:14.731
You renting?

48:14.808 --> 48:16.147
Yeah.

48:16.230 --> 48:17.355
Thank God.

48:17.439 --> 48:19.444
How did you find me?

48:19.521 --> 48:22.611
Um, I made Anton
tell me where you live.

48:22.688 --> 48:24.357
What, and you drove
all the way up here

48:24.434 --> 48:25.773
in the middle
of the night?

48:25.850 --> 48:28.399
You didn't call
or text or...?

48:28.476 --> 48:29.903
Should I go?

48:29.980 --> 48:31.648
No, no, please, no.

48:31.725 --> 48:33.646
Sit down.

48:33.730 --> 48:36.773
Can I get you anything?
I... I've got whiskey.

48:36.850 --> 48:40.078
You can, but let me just
say something first.

48:41.353 --> 48:44.259
Thank you for what you did.

48:44.719 --> 48:46.070
I didn't do anything.

48:46.147 --> 48:47.494
No, you did.

48:47.571 --> 48:49.220
You stood up for my son.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.615
That was crazy earlier.

48:51.735 --> 48:54.224
Well, we've all been there.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.554
We've been, uh...

48:58.977 --> 49:01.056
divorced for so long,

49:01.133 --> 49:03.512
you'd think we'd be
over it by now,

49:03.633 --> 49:05.970
figured out a way
to forgive each other,

49:06.235 --> 49:08.053
find some peace.

49:08.453 --> 49:10.592
But somehow...

49:11.703 --> 49:13.967
They say time
heals all wounds,

49:14.044 --> 49:15.803
but sometimes it doesn't.

49:17.071 --> 49:18.278
No, it doesn't.

49:18.355 --> 49:20.429
It just makes things worse.

49:21.985 --> 49:24.201
Anyway, I just...

49:26.397 --> 49:28.898
Of course he should have
seen the damn school.

49:28.975 --> 49:30.761
I should have taken him.

49:32.855 --> 49:34.720
I'm gonna take him this week.

49:35.969 --> 49:37.709
What about the board meeting?

49:37.786 --> 49:39.329
What about it?

49:39.406 --> 49:41.595
If they fire me, they fire me.

49:44.149 --> 49:46.137
Look, what if I take him?

49:47.972 --> 49:49.305
You?

49:49.438 --> 49:50.687
I'm the neutral party.

49:50.764 --> 49:53.126
I can take him there,
introduce him to my friend.

49:53.203 --> 49:54.864
He can observe a class.

49:55.022 --> 49:57.429
Then we come back,
and he can make his decision.

49:58.156 --> 49:59.636
You'd do that?

49:59.922 --> 50:01.369
I'd be happy to do it.

50:01.446 --> 50:02.802
If it's okay with you.

50:02.879 --> 50:05.082
And Carl, of course.

50:05.438 --> 50:07.001
If it's a choice between this

50:07.078 --> 50:08.773
and the goddamn Marines,
who knows?

50:08.850 --> 50:10.365
Maybe he would.

50:10.972 --> 50:12.546
He should go.

50:19.439 --> 50:22.154
Why are you doing this, Noah?

50:23.399 --> 50:25.845
You really think my son
is that brilliant?

50:27.967 --> 50:29.818
Yeah, I do.

50:30.789 --> 50:32.686
But I'm not doing it for him.

50:47.897 --> 50:49.563
Mmm.

51:17.442 --> 51:18.632
Does it turn you on

51:18.709 --> 51:19.992
- that I'm your boss?
- Oh, Jesus.

51:20.059 --> 51:22.097
Janelle, shut the fuck up.

51:38.480 --> 51:40.959
Oh, my. Oh, my.

51:41.063 --> 51:43.274
Oh, my God.

51:45.147 --> 51:46.605
Oh, my.

51:56.314 --> 51:58.147
Oh, fuck.

52:08.938 --> 52:10.486
Excuse me.
Can you tell me

52:10.563 --> 52:12.444
what the connecting gate
to New York is?

52:12.521 --> 52:13.815
We don't have
that information.

52:13.892 --> 52:15.573
You'll have to check in
on the ground.

52:15.650 --> 52:17.270
Okay, thanks.

52:18.321 --> 52:19.778
Hey.

52:19.914 --> 52:21.653
Because we were
delayed taking off,

52:21.730 --> 52:23.530
we're gonna have to book it
when we hit the ground

52:23.597 --> 52:24.984
to make our
connection, okay?

52:25.061 --> 52:26.553
Should've got a direct flight.

52:27.480 --> 52:29.117
Yeah, well, your mother
booked this yesterday.

52:29.184 --> 52:31.220
We were lucky to get
any flight at all.

52:32.589 --> 52:34.204
Did you talk to your dad?

52:34.829 --> 52:36.610
He won't call me back.

52:42.272 --> 52:44.023
You're listening to my book?

52:44.100 --> 52:45.189
Yeah.

52:45.508 --> 52:47.345
It's pretty good, actually.

52:48.126 --> 52:49.492
Thanks.

52:53.868 --> 52:55.420
What?

52:55.497 --> 52:56.928
That's weird.

52:59.681 --> 53:00.888
Yo.

53:05.055 --> 53:06.717
Hi.

53:06.824 --> 53:09.685
Uh, we missed our connecting
flight to New York, so...

53:09.762 --> 53:10.891
Uh, no.

53:11.867 --> 53:13.153
"No"?

53:13.230 --> 53:16.115
No, we have no more flights
to New York today.

53:16.355 --> 53:18.204
What about the shuttle?

53:18.281 --> 53:20.158
They're all booked.

53:20.235 --> 53:22.494
We've had delays all day
because of the wind.

53:22.571 --> 53:23.546
What about standby?

53:23.623 --> 53:25.467
Good luck with standby.

53:25.571 --> 53:27.193
Come on, is there anything
you can do to help?

53:27.260 --> 53:30.959
Well, let me see
if I can switch you to...

53:31.036 --> 53:32.082
Ah.

53:32.625 --> 53:34.619
Tomorrow night, 8:23.

53:34.696 --> 53:36.232
No, we have to get
to New York tonight.

53:36.309 --> 53:38.012
Then rent a car.

53:45.730 --> 53:47.648
They're gonna
run out of cars.

53:53.332 --> 53:54.998
Cole?

53:58.303 --> 53:59.813
Wait.

54:01.214 --> 54:02.620
Wait. Cole, slow down.

54:02.697 --> 54:04.694
What do you mean?

54:04.771 --> 54:06.773
So, who's coming to get us?

54:06.850 --> 54:08.554
An old friend.

54:21.314 --> 54:24.149
Welcome to
O'Hare International Airport.

54:24.226 --> 54:25.857
Loading zones
for rideshare services

54:25.934 --> 54:27.648
are located on the upper level

54:27.725 --> 54:30.318
of terminals one,
three and four.

54:44.251 --> 54:45.928
I'm sure she's fine.

54:47.305 --> 54:49.255
That makes one of us.
