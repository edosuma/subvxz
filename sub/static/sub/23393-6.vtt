Cheese and crackers, Frankie.
Take your turn.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.937
Two of clubs.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.691
Two of hearts.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.448
Spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti!

01:13.531 --> 01:16.284
-GD it, Teddie!
-Ha-ha. Too slow.

01:18.161 --> 01:19.788
Hey, Robin, you're supposed to be napping.

01:19.871 --> 01:22.290
I'm too old to nap. Let me play.

01:22.373 --> 01:25.877
Kid, this is a very complicated game...
of our own division.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.671
-Devising.
-Don't correct me.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.173
Don't misuse words.

01:30.965 --> 01:31.925
She's right, Robin.

01:32.008 --> 01:34.427
It'd take years to teach you,
decades even.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.596
But I have candy!

01:38.306 --> 01:39.808
You won't tell Mom we let you gamble?

01:39.891 --> 01:42.894
I don't tell her you change
into fast clothes before school.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.479
Deal him in.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.193
May I shuffle?

01:52.862 --> 01:53.780
Apparently not.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.627
Knee again?

02:08.461 --> 02:11.172
-Knee again.
-I'm sorry you're in pain,

02:11.256 --> 02:15.009
but I hope the tools mean
that you've finally considered my proposal

02:15.093 --> 02:17.971
to replace the stairs
with an indoor slide.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.305
I'm fine.

02:20.348 --> 02:22.725
And stop leaving blueprints by my bed.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.772
You know I didn't do that, right?

02:28.690 --> 02:29.774
I know.

02:29.858 --> 02:31.276
For once.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.404
The hinge is rusty
and I think we have dry rot.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.532
Are you gonna use that
to climb onto the counter?

02:37.615 --> 02:40.368
No, I'm gonna use it
to do an erotic dance.

02:40.451 --> 02:42.036
Why don't we ask someone to help?

02:42.120 --> 02:43.955
I can do it myself.

02:44.038 --> 02:47.500
-But you aren't in any real shape--
-I'm fine!

02:47.584 --> 02:50.712
Once you start asking other people
to do things that you used to do,

02:50.795 --> 02:55.091
it's just an indoor slide
into the geriatric ward.

02:55.174 --> 02:58.094
Boy, oh boy. Arlene really shook you up.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.180
Oh...

03:00.597 --> 03:03.057
Have you given any more thought
to a replacement?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.226
-For your knee.

03:05.310 --> 03:08.730
Everything is under control.

03:09.814 --> 03:13.359
It's just a simple matter
of managing my pain,

03:13.443 --> 03:14.611
which I do...

03:15.111 --> 03:17.447
with a delicate cocktail...

03:18.448 --> 03:19.490
of everything.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.910
Anything in that pile for emotional pain?

03:21.993 --> 03:25.580
Why? Did Liev Schreiber hurt himself
at a celebrity golf tournament?

03:25.663 --> 03:28.374
No, I just can't stop thinking
about Teddie.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.003
Aw, Frankie, it's hard,

03:32.086 --> 03:35.215
but, you know, not all siblings are close.

03:35.298 --> 03:39.010
I get a very impersonal Christmas E-Card
every year from my brother,

03:39.093 --> 03:41.221
and that's enough for both of us.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.348
But Teddie and I were close. I want that back again.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.852
-You can have it with me.
-Oh, Grace.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.105
Sometimes I forget that within
that ice sculpture of a whippet

03:51.189 --> 03:53.942
beats the hot heart of my bosom friend.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.276
I take it back.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.988
No. I genuinely am asking for your advice.

03:59.072 --> 03:59.989
No jokesies.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.243
You ambushed your sister.

04:04.953 --> 04:08.957
So, why not try inviting her over
for a friendly dinner instead?

04:09.540 --> 04:10.959
That's a great idea.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.087
I will ambush her
with a dinner invitation! You can buffer.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.338
I'll get our trench coats.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.800
Enticing as that sounds,
I'm headed to the hardware store.

04:18.883 --> 04:22.512
I have a date
with a broken piece of old wood.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.305
Well, Nick will be jealous,

04:24.389 --> 04:27.141
but I think it sounds
like a much better match for you.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.021
Sorry, you just teed me right up.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.995
Hey, you busy?

04:47.078 --> 04:48.329
In fact, I am.

04:48.913 --> 04:51.833
Now that you've alienated
our new friends...

04:52.500 --> 04:55.795
I'm looking for other candidates
on this website I've found

04:55.878 --> 04:58.131
called Adult Friend Finder.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.174
That is not what that's for.

05:01.342 --> 05:04.929
I forgot, you're the expert
on adult friends.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.724
Listen, I don't want
to fight with you anymore, Sol.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.767
I'm sorry about last night.

05:10.977 --> 05:12.020
And?

05:12.103 --> 05:13.938
And I shouldn't have talked to Oliver.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.983
And?
-And I screwed up.

05:17.692 --> 05:18.526
And?

05:18.609 --> 05:21.487
And I'm out of things to apologize for,
but...

05:22.488 --> 05:23.823
I do have a peace offering.

05:23.906 --> 05:26.617
Well, I don't know what kind
of peace offering you could possibly...

05:28.411 --> 05:29.579
What are those?

05:29.662 --> 05:32.874
I booked us a luxury berth

05:32.957 --> 05:37.170
on the world's premiere
and only folk music cruise.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.215
<i>Both Tides Now</i>?!

05:41.299 --> 05:42.341
Yes!

05:42.425 --> 05:45.344
I've been dying to go on this cruise
for years!

05:45.428 --> 05:47.138
I know! I thought it sank.

05:47.221 --> 05:51.225
No, that was its competitor,
<i>Hey, Mr. Tambourine Boat.</i>

05:51.309 --> 05:56.189
<i>Both Tides Now</i> is a floating stage
for some of folk rock's greatest greats!

05:56.773 --> 06:00.985
And for some of folk rock's greatest
pretty-okays.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.154
But you hate folk rock.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.323
And cruises. You'll be in hell.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.407
But I'll be with you.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.869
I want us to have
some quality time together.

06:09.952 --> 06:12.622
No jails, no jazz hands, just us.

06:12.705 --> 06:15.166
What about<i> The Music Man?</i>
How can you miss rehearsals?

06:15.249 --> 06:16.209
I'm quitting.

06:17.502 --> 06:19.921
But I thought you were enjoying
assistant directing.

06:20.004 --> 06:23.674
You mean assisting Peter while he
ignores my notes or steals them?

06:23.758 --> 06:26.719
Well, if you're not happy...

06:28.179 --> 06:31.599
We'd get to eat pancakes
shaped like Joan Baez...

06:32.100 --> 06:34.769
with Joan Baez!

06:34.852 --> 06:39.065
And Cobe Tobenz, the Charo of the Ozarks.
If he's out of rehab.

06:39.148 --> 06:40.149
Possibly?

06:40.233 --> 06:42.276
I assume there will be drinks
on this cruise?

06:42.360 --> 06:45.822
-Like I'm gonna need a lot of them.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.241
-Oh, baby.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.867
I gotta get out my folk wear.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.331
Holy God, you two run fast.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.708
Yeah, we've been running
every day before AA.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.377
And after AA.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.089
-We have a lot of energy...
-To get rid of.

07:03.673 --> 07:08.344
Speaking of not having sex, I just got
<i>Anne of Green Gables</i> on Blu-ray!

07:08.428 --> 07:10.805
-Ooh!

07:10.888 --> 07:12.849
-Absolutely!

07:12.932 --> 07:16.519
Absolutely wish I could, but, uh...

07:17.353 --> 07:19.605
Nadia and I have a thing later.

07:20.148 --> 07:20.982
No, we don't.

07:21.399 --> 07:24.694
I have a movie makeup exam
for my cosmetology class.

07:24.777 --> 07:27.613
But as far as I know, you're totally free.

07:28.156 --> 07:31.242
<i>Anne of Green Gables</i> and Allison.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.953
-You're gonna have fun.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.665
Okay, gotta go practice my scab work.

07:37.748 --> 07:38.749
Bye, boys!

07:41.085 --> 07:42.670
Wish you'd give Allison a shot.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.592
It sucks having my best friend/brother
hate my best friend/mother of my child.

07:47.675 --> 07:50.428
-Come on, I don't hate her.
-Then come over.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.973
I am going to marry this girl.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.475
I know.

07:55.558 --> 07:58.436
Then spend some time with her.
Make an effort.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.813
She's more than just a collection
of imaginary rashes.

08:00.897 --> 08:02.482
Fine. I'll come over later.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.358
For you.

08:04.442 --> 08:07.195
And because these shorts,
they don't wick moisture well,

08:07.278 --> 08:09.655
so they tend to stink up
the old tiny house.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.782
You do not want to be in that hotbox.

08:13.451 --> 08:16.412
-Thanks, man. Really means a lot.

08:26.255 --> 08:27.507
What the hell are you doing?

08:28.925 --> 08:30.593
Inviting you to dinner!

08:31.385 --> 08:33.387
How'd you even know
I was gonna be here?

08:33.471 --> 08:36.599
Well, when last we met,
I intuited you needed a root canal.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.351
And my suspicions were confirmed

08:38.434 --> 08:42.939
when I snuck into your office this morning
and saw it on your calendar.

08:43.356 --> 08:44.649
You're blocking my car.

08:44.732 --> 08:48.778
Teddie, I realize
I approached things all wrong...

08:48.861 --> 08:50.321
Hmm. You got that right.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.989
...by letting you escape.

08:52.073 --> 08:57.036
I'd like to invite you to a formal,
clearing the air dinner,<i> chez moi.</i>

08:58.120 --> 08:59.121
No, thank you.

08:59.997 --> 09:02.083
But I haven't given you my avails yet.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.335
I don't need them. I'm not coming.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.128
But I need us to talk.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.713
Oh, what's there to talk about?

09:07.797 --> 09:09.090
My wedding.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.885
Oh, you mean when I said Sol was gay
and I was right?

09:12.969 --> 09:15.471
Oh, there, the air is cleared.
May I go now?

09:16.222 --> 09:17.431
I had a stroke.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.226
And you're telling me this because...?

09:20.309 --> 09:22.228
Because it scared the hell out of me.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.773
I don't want to leave things unresolved
with us.

09:25.856 --> 09:30.570
So you are using the threat of your death
to get me to come to dinner?

09:31.821 --> 09:33.239
I am if it's working.

09:34.073 --> 09:38.035
Things aren't unresolved, they just...
are the way they are.

09:39.078 --> 09:43.874
So, you'd be fine if I'd died
with us not speaking to one another?

09:43.958 --> 09:46.669
Well, why start now?
You haven't been in my life for years.

09:46.752 --> 09:50.590
And based on what's happening here,
I think it's been better for it.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.593
You know what?

09:54.844 --> 09:56.345
I tried, Teddie.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.640
I guess you don't care if I forgive you.

10:02.685 --> 10:03.853
What did you say?

10:03.936 --> 10:05.688
Enjoy the rest of your life.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.456
Oh. Excuse me, ma'am?

10:24.707 --> 10:27.793
Hi, for our differently-abled
shoppers' convenience,

10:27.877 --> 10:30.588
our scooter station is right there.

10:31.672 --> 10:34.008
I'm not a scooter-cart person.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.218
Do I look like a scooter

10:37.428 --> 10:40.473
If it's not too forward, I would like
to say you look very beautiful today.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.645
Why is Big Anthony waving at me?

10:45.728 --> 10:48.314
Because he is having the time of his life.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.984
Look, just tell me if you have this, uh...

10:53.611 --> 10:55.613
This is a hinge for an indoor shutter.

10:55.696 --> 10:59.033
It's hinge number 853002.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.326
We have it.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.788
It's a bit of a haul,
but you're gonna have to go... 234.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.998
Got it. Aisle 34.

11:06.082 --> 11:09.210
Oh, no, no... 234, as in two hundred.

11:19.720 --> 11:22.098
Oh, wow, you just swallow it dry, huh?

11:22.723 --> 11:24.100
I'm a professional.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.394
Hmm.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.001
-Stop!

11:51.460 --> 11:54.713
That was great! Just spectacular.

11:55.589 --> 11:57.258
-No.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.177
I was just saying something
in a convincing way.

12:00.678 --> 12:04.098
That's called "acting."
Want to give it a try?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.935
Yes, I'm going to act
like I wasn't hurt by that comment.

12:08.018 --> 12:09.520
You're even bad at that.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.065
-Sorry I'm late.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.401
Oh, hi, Robert.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.611
Peter, do you have a moment?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.238
Not really, Robert.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.908
This number is a bust. The play is ruined.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.661
Every bad thing the dead parents
of everyone here

12:25.744 --> 12:27.163
ever said about them was true.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.082
I did have a note about this number.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.418
-Mm-hmm.

12:32.877 --> 12:33.961
What kind of note?

12:34.670 --> 12:35.504
Well...

12:36.088 --> 12:40.551
Paul is marching in place,
but he should be engaging the audience.

12:40.634 --> 12:42.428
He needs to march down to the front,

12:42.511 --> 12:45.890
sing straight out,
and pull all of us into the band.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.268
Hold, everyone! I've had a vision!

12:49.685 --> 12:52.146
Paul, you need to march down to the front,

12:52.229 --> 12:56.108
sing straight out,
and pull all of us into the band.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.318
Take it from the top.

13:04.575 --> 13:06.243
What did you want to talk about?

13:07.369 --> 13:09.788
-Oh, my God!
My bones!

13:10.956 --> 13:12.625
Terrible note, Robert.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.415
Say you won't replace me.

13:53.999 --> 13:55.334
How could we?

13:55.834 --> 13:57.378
There's just one you.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.881
You just get better and you'll be back
treading the boards ASAP.

14:01.465 --> 14:02.591
Thanks, Peter.

14:06.095 --> 14:09.348
Okay, those legs are dog meat.
You've gotta step in and play Harold.

14:09.431 --> 14:12.560
-But you just said you wouldn't--
-Again, acting.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.688
Am I the only one here
who knows how to do it?

14:16.105 --> 14:17.314
George could do it.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.276
Look at George!

14:20.734 --> 14:23.070
Do you really think
he can pull off pinstripes?

14:23.153 --> 14:25.447
He'll look like a can of Tab in a hat.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.366
Oh, oh.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.326
What about Charlie? He could play Hill.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.203
-I can't do it.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.956
I know my strengths, and I don't have any.

14:34.290 --> 14:37.126
-Oh, geez.
-There you go, Robert. It's you.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.379
No! It can't be me.
I came here today to quit.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.173
-Things have been rough with Sol.

14:43.257 --> 14:47.011
We need some time together.
I'm taking him on a folk music cruise.

14:47.094 --> 14:50.973
Oh, because marital problems
are always solved on open water.

14:51.056 --> 14:52.266
Don't you watch<i> Dateline?</i>

14:52.349 --> 14:54.852
I'll end up on<i> Dateline</i> for sure
if we don't make this trip.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.104
There's always time to fix your marriage.

14:57.187 --> 14:59.690
-I need a Harold Hill.
-And I need my husband.

14:59.773 --> 15:05.446
It pains me to rob the greater San Diego
area of my Tappy Award-winning gifts,

15:05.529 --> 15:06.739
but I'm afraid I must.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.909
Wow, Robert, this is rich.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.536
-It's your fault we're in this position.
!

15:12.620 --> 15:16.498
It's also eerily similar
to my favorite part in<i> Showgirls.</i>

15:16.582 --> 15:17.917
You're not hearing me. Are you hearing yourself?

15:19.418 --> 15:21.003
Look at all these people.

15:21.086 --> 15:23.923
You'd be letting the entire company down.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.049
Think of Charlie.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.509
This is all she has.

15:27.968 --> 15:31.096
Be the first person
to ever think about Charlie.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.942
Teddie. How'd you find my house?

15:43.025 --> 15:46.028
You're not the only one
with good detective skills.

15:46.445 --> 15:50.574
I followed you home and it wasn't easy.
You drive like a lunatic.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.242
Well, it's chipmunk mating season--

15:52.326 --> 15:54.495
You don't get to forgive me.

15:54.578 --> 15:55.454
What?

15:55.537 --> 15:59.416
You seem to be under the impression
that you're the injured party here.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.711
-Well, I am.

16:03.128 --> 16:05.839
Oh. No, I didn't. When?

16:05.923 --> 16:10.844
Ninety-three to '97.
And, oh yes, again briefly in 2003.

16:10.928 --> 16:16.892
Of course, my husband wasn't with me
for that round because he passed in '99.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.811
I'm sorry.

16:18.894 --> 16:21.230
Well, I'm sorry you had a stroke,

16:21.313 --> 16:25.901
but, Frankie, you cut me out of your life
after your wedding,

16:25.985 --> 16:27.653
not the other way around.

16:27.736 --> 16:29.363
Because of the thing with Sol.

16:29.446 --> 16:32.032
It was the last straw.
You'd always been angry at me.

16:32.116 --> 16:36.954
Even before my wedding, it seemed like
the happier I was, the madder you got.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.872
And I never really knew why.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.874
Really

16:41.458 --> 16:44.837
Well, I thought maybe
you were jealous of my hair.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.883
Frankie, this is not about Sol being gay
or me being spiteful.

16:49.967 --> 16:54.054
It's about what you did after Robin died.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.028
I don't know what's keeping Bud.

17:09.737 --> 17:10.738
More distilled water?

17:10.821 --> 17:13.032
No, thanks. I'm stuffed.

17:16.994 --> 17:21.457
"Hey, you two. Sorry. Just gonna be
another 15 to 175 minutes late."

17:23.751 --> 17:25.127
I think we've been set up.

17:25.669 --> 17:26.795
What do you mean?

17:26.879 --> 17:30.132
Bud is trying to force us
to spend time together.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.634
Oh, is this because I told him
I didn't want to hang out with you?

17:33.927 --> 17:35.679
Wait, hold on a second.

17:35.763 --> 17:37.973
I told him that I didn't want
to hang out with you.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.892
Why wouldn't you want
to hang out with me?

17:40.434 --> 17:44.063
Gee, I don't know. Because you get
an erotic thrill from EpiPens?

17:44.146 --> 17:45.981
Yeah, I know. You think I'm a drip.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.108
At least I pay rent here.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.945
Hey, I paid my rent in fun.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.697
Are you implying that I'm not fun?

17:54.114 --> 17:57.493
No. No. I'm having a blast right now.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.619
Me, too.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.580
Leaving us here alone together
was a great idea, Bud.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.251
All right, look.

18:08.545 --> 18:12.091
Clearly, he really wants us to be friends.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.176
-It's not like I want to be your enemy.
-Yeah.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.386
And I don't want to be your enemy, either.

18:16.470 --> 18:19.014
So, since we both love Bud,

18:19.098 --> 18:23.185
do you want to try and, you know... bond?

18:23.268 --> 18:24.686
Okay. Sure.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.397
What's your favorite band?

18:27.481 --> 18:30.484
I don't listen to music.
It aggravates my Meniere's disease.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.111
Cool.

18:58.846 --> 18:59.680
There.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.226
Use your grabber!

19:05.894 --> 19:07.980
On the side of your chair!

19:10.816 --> 19:12.818
You gotta yank!

19:12.901 --> 19:15.362
Would you please keep your voice down?

19:16.947 --> 19:17.948
There.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.997
Oh! Damn it.

19:26.999 --> 19:31.628
Excuse me? Hi. Do you know where
the dog condominiums are

19:31.712 --> 19:34.923
-Oh, God. I hate my fucking life.
-It goes with the dog houses.

19:37.551 --> 19:41.180
It's for my girlfriend and her dog.
She's pretty particular about...

19:41.972 --> 19:44.308
-It had to be a condominium.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.579
Uh... Uh, ma'am, you have to pay for that!

20:06.622 --> 20:08.415
-Keep it!

20:09.041 --> 20:10.918
You also have to leave the scooter! I'll leave it on the curb!

20:12.961 --> 20:16.506
-Fu... uck!

20:18.675 --> 20:20.302
This isn't about Robin.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.720
Oh, sure it is!

20:21.803 --> 20:25.641
After he died, you did whatever
you wanted, whenever you wanted.

20:25.724 --> 20:29.061
You ran off with some guy,
then you ran off with some band.

20:29.144 --> 20:32.397
You're holding that against me?
I had to get out of that house.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.274
Which meant I had to stay.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.485
No. You chose to stay.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.779
How else could you feel like a martyr?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.113
Why don't you grow up?

20:40.197 --> 20:41.657
I did.

20:41.740 --> 20:45.077
Do you think it was easy
to strike out on my own at 18?

20:45.160 --> 20:48.288
I think it's easier to pick up and bail
than it is to stay.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.707
No. It was very lonely.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.335
But after Robin, it was just too hard.

20:53.418 --> 20:55.462
Dad was never the same,
Mom checked out.

20:55.545 --> 20:58.090
You were always on me about something.

20:58.173 --> 20:59.841
School. Boys. Reefer.

20:59.925 --> 21:05.055
Well, apparently not enough, if the choice
of your decor is any indication.

21:05.138 --> 21:07.516
Those are collector's items.

21:08.475 --> 21:11.520
I'm sorry you never approved of me,
Teddie.

21:11.603 --> 21:15.899
But I love my house.
I love my life. I'm proud of my family.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.735
And even of my super gay ex, Sol.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.196
Well, then...

21:23.073 --> 21:24.741
So what do you need me for?

21:25.534 --> 21:27.452
Because once upon a time...

21:28.537 --> 21:30.247
you were my best friend.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.458
Don't you think I wanted that to go on?

21:34.459 --> 21:37.212
You were <i>my</i> best friend,
but you were also my sister.

21:37.296 --> 21:40.048
-And things were brutal.
-That's why I left.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.217
What was there to stay for?

21:43.635 --> 21:44.469
Me.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.892
Officer, this has never happened before,

21:50.976 --> 21:53.061
and it will never, ever happen again.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.356
Yeah, considering the extremely
unusual circumstances here,

21:56.440 --> 21:58.567
-I actually believe that.
-Yeah.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.986
But I do have to ask
if you've been drinking.

22:01.445 --> 22:03.989
You do

22:04.406 --> 22:08.452
Because you hit a police car
with a scooter and you smell like Boston.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.498
Well, I have a prescription.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.126
Have one for that flask in your purse?

22:21.798 --> 22:24.926
Girl to girl, what are my options here?

22:25.010 --> 22:29.264
Police officer to drunk lady, I'm gonna
have to write you up for public intox.

22:29.347 --> 22:30.724
How you planning on getting home?

22:30.807 --> 22:34.728
Excuse me, Officer. Hi.
I was just about to drive my friend home.

22:34.811 --> 22:36.438
-That's Barry.
-I'm Barry.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.106
Hi, Barry.

22:55.707 --> 22:59.169
Hey! I've been
on the folk cruise message boards

22:59.252 --> 23:03.423
and people think our surprise
special guest might be Dan Fogelberg.

23:03.507 --> 23:05.092
Oh, I think he's dead.

23:05.634 --> 23:06.468
Oh.

23:06.968 --> 23:08.053
I should tell them.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.639
How are you?

23:11.223 --> 23:12.390
How'd it go with Peter?

23:13.308 --> 23:16.103
Did he cry
Did he call you the C

23:16.186 --> 23:17.938
You won't believe what happened.

23:19.481 --> 23:21.024
-You didn't quit.
-No, I quit.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.985
I'm officially no longer
Peter's assistant director.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.196
Oh, thank God. You scared me.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.156
Yeah, but when I was doing that,

23:28.240 --> 23:31.201
Paul sort of tumbled off the stage
and broke both legs.

23:31.284 --> 23:32.327
-Yes!

23:32.410 --> 23:33.328
Is he all right?

23:33.411 --> 23:36.414
Yes, but he's out for the season,
bless his heart.

23:36.957 --> 23:38.083
And now...

23:38.583 --> 23:40.961
Peter wants me to play Harold Hill.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.295
Oh.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.589
I told him I can't, of course.

23:45.966 --> 23:47.008
Oh.

23:47.592 --> 23:48.426
Good.

23:48.844 --> 23:53.014
But... you know,
he really laid it on thick.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.684
Yeah, I think I know the feeling.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.229
Are we going on this cruise or not?

24:00.147 --> 24:01.440
Well, of course we are.

24:02.649 --> 24:03.692
Right?

24:03.775 --> 24:05.235
I thought we were.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.946
Well... then we are.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.991
Right?

24:11.074 --> 24:14.703
You want me to tell you
to go save the show instead.

24:14.786 --> 24:17.164
Honey. I knew you'd understand.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.790
Because I'm not going to.

24:18.874 --> 24:20.000
Oh.

24:20.917 --> 24:24.713
Well, um... I thought we could
check if there's another cruise--

24:24.796 --> 24:27.465
There isn't. It's once a year,
and I'm going.

24:27.924 --> 24:31.052
-Whether you come or not.
-Oh, you can't go without me.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.137
Sure I can!

24:32.721 --> 24:34.264
I'll be a free man in Paris.

24:34.347 --> 24:37.559
Or off the coast of Baja, California.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.145
Let's face it,
you didn't want to come anyway.

24:40.228 --> 24:43.607
That's not true.
I want us to spend some time together.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.609
Not badly enough.

24:47.777 --> 24:51.740
So... you do your thing and I'll do mine.

24:53.909 --> 24:54.993
Sol!

25:00.207 --> 25:03.043
Sorry, that was the wind.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.671
That was me!

25:23.230 --> 25:24.564
Before you guys yell at me,

25:24.648 --> 25:29.361
I figured a good Escape Room scenario
just might...

25:31.696 --> 25:33.907
-Hey, buddy.

25:33.990 --> 25:35.617
Why don't you come sit down?

25:35.700 --> 25:36.660
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.705
-Yeah, sweetie. Come here.

25:42.332 --> 25:45.085
We just, um...
we need to talk to you about something.

25:45.168 --> 25:48.380
And the important thing to remember is,
this is not your fault.

25:48.463 --> 25:53.635
Bud, sometimes two people try very hard
to make things work, but...

25:53.718 --> 25:57.222
Your brother and I have decided
to not like each other... amicably.

25:58.974 --> 25:59.975
What's that supposed to mean?

26:00.058 --> 26:03.853
It means that...
we both love you very, very much.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.021
So much.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.899
But we're not gonna be hanging out.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.152
Ever. We tried. Very hard. But...

26:11.236 --> 26:13.446
We've grown apart in the last 45 minutes.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.949
Forty, but it feels like 45. Yeah.

26:16.032 --> 26:19.411
Wait. So, that's it?
You're just gonna stop trying?

26:20.287 --> 26:22.706
-No, little guy.
-No, we would never give up on you.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.416
We're just gonna love you separately.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.793
Okay. Okay.

26:26.876 --> 26:29.045
I shouldn't have set you up, that's on me.

26:29.129 --> 26:31.589
But you realize how immature this is.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.926
Or is it the most mature thing
we could possibly do?

26:35.010 --> 26:37.762
No. No, it's not.
What I was doing was mature.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.264
-Not that part.

26:39.347 --> 26:40.265
All right, Bud...

26:41.641 --> 26:44.978
remember when Mom and Dad told us
that they were splitting up?

26:45.061 --> 26:48.273
And we didn't know how we were
gonna get through it, but we did.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.025
And everything's fine.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.403
You know, it's separate, but it's fine.
And we all do things together.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.780
We're friends with Mom.
We're friends with Dad.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.033
We're friends with Robert. We know Grace.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.743
And everything's fine.

27:00.327 --> 27:01.578
And everything's fine.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.924
Thank you for the help back there.

27:15.592 --> 27:16.509
Sure, it's no problem.

27:16.593 --> 27:21.556
But you did not see me. You did not see
that thing that I was driving.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.933
Look, I'm an accountant.
I'm used to ignoring the law.

27:26.227 --> 27:28.730
I don't know why I said that.
I love the law.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.983
Well, there was this one time,
I bought a leather jacket and I--

27:32.067 --> 27:33.068
-Barry.
-Sorry.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.945
-This car ride never happened.
-Thank you.

27:36.029 --> 27:36.905
Yeah.

27:38.615 --> 27:42.077
Look, I'm probably gonna regret
asking this, but...

27:44.162 --> 27:45.205
are you okay?

27:47.499 --> 27:50.502
Look, since this car ride
is not happening,

27:50.585 --> 27:52.796
you know,
you might as well come clean, right?

27:55.131 --> 27:56.633
It's my knee.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.552
And I don't want Brianna
to know how bad it is,

27:59.636 --> 28:04.432
because she is mean and judgmental
and she will put me in a home.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.477
If anyone would think it was cool
to be drunk in a hardware store,

28:07.560 --> 28:08.728
it's your daughter.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.688
Yeah, she'd probably get a kick out of it.

28:10.772 --> 28:14.692
Yeah. And she actually might be...
really understanding if...

28:15.318 --> 28:18.029
-I don't know, something was wrong.
-Nothing's wrong.

28:18.947 --> 28:23.243
Well, except I might be
a scooter person after all.

28:24.160 --> 28:26.079
I'm sorry, a "scooter person"?

28:26.162 --> 28:27.288
I don't know.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.290
It's like my body is just...

28:29.833 --> 28:31.960
slipping away.

28:33.002 --> 28:35.797
And it's the fucking pits, Barry.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.549
You'll see when you hit 70.

28:39.134 --> 28:40.677
One day it's a hinge,

28:40.760 --> 28:42.721
the next day it's the whole damn house.

28:44.389 --> 28:47.934
Well, the house looks pretty good
from where I'm sitting.

28:49.769 --> 28:51.146
Barry, are you hitting on me?

28:51.896 --> 28:53.940
No! No! No!

28:54.023 --> 28:55.608
That can't be what's happening. No.

28:55.692 --> 28:58.486
All I'm saying is that if you are,
you know, over 70,

28:58.570 --> 29:01.531
and you think that's giving you
a run for your money, then I'm screwed.

29:01.614 --> 29:05.577
I mean, look at you.
You know, you're selling sex toys,

29:05.660 --> 29:07.579
and doing your own home renovation.

29:07.662 --> 29:11.291
I can barely lift the dog condo
on the roof.

29:11.374 --> 29:16.421
I don't know what I was thinking
trying to fix that... shutter by myself.

29:16.504 --> 29:18.089
Oh, my God!

29:19.007 --> 29:20.884
I still need a hinge.

29:21.468 --> 29:23.094
Would you take me to Lowe's?

29:23.887 --> 29:25.096
Sure can do.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.599
Let's plug it in the old navigation. Oh.

29:27.682 --> 29:29.601
Boop, boop, boop, boop, boop.

29:32.187 --> 29:33.855
I was kidding. I know where it is.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.232
What?

29:38.151 --> 29:41.446
Would you believe that I didn't drive
on the highway for years

29:41.529 --> 29:42.822
because of Robin?

29:43.406 --> 29:45.283
Sometimes I wonder today,

29:45.366 --> 29:47.535
you know, with airbags and seat belts--

29:47.619 --> 29:51.372
Well, I never think about that. But I do
wonder what he would look like today.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.626
Oh, God, he'd be 50 years old.

29:56.252 --> 29:59.923
Frankie,
he was six years younger than you.

30:00.381 --> 30:02.383
Right, so that would make him...

30:04.844 --> 30:06.137
Sixty-eight.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.514
Huh.

30:07.597 --> 30:09.182
You never did learn math, did you?

30:09.265 --> 30:12.060
I did, but I lost it again
at Lollapalooza.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.231
I'm sorry about your husband.

30:17.357 --> 30:19.567
I'm sorry about your breast cancer.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.611
No, it's okay. I'm okay.

30:21.694 --> 30:25.949
I had reconstruction, so now I have
the bosom of a teenager.

30:28.284 --> 30:33.039
But I'm sorry about all the stuff
I missed, particularly your boys.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.291
-I'd love for you to meet them.
-Mmm.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.086
You know, we almost named Coyote
"Robin,"

30:38.503 --> 30:40.588
but I thought it might be too tough.

30:42.131 --> 30:43.925
As opposed to "Coyote"?

30:44.008 --> 30:45.134
Ha ha.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.807
I probably should be going.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.935
-No. No rush.
-Oh, no, no. I have papers to mark.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.645
Here. One game?

31:01.818 --> 31:02.735
Are you gonna cheat?

31:02.819 --> 31:04.237
Super definitely.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.781
But I don't have any gum on me.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.741
I know what we can use.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.624
You realize your roommate's
a drug addict, right?

31:17.667 --> 31:18.543
Oh, I know.
