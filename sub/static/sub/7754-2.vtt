I just didn't run you over.
Now get out of my way!
>> Gumball: No way!

12:34.321 --> 12:38.289
I am not leaving your side until
i have saved your life in

>> Gumball: I'll never ever
leave your side.

Here they are.
"Antiseptic action."
>> Gumball: What's this

13:35.816 --> 13:39.951

middle of a floor?
Mr. Robinson could trip over it.

13:39.953 --> 13:45.557
There. Safely out of the way.
>> What?! Oh!

>> Gumball: To protect you from
intruders.

15:38.138 --> 15:41.539
All they have to do is ring the

>> Listen, kid.
This is the most important night

>> Gumball: But I've got to be
there to save your life.

That's so painful!
Aah! Oh, man, that hurts!

16:33.693 --> 16:37.495
Oh, I'll try to walk it off.
[ Crunch! ]
Oh, bad idea.

16:37.497 --> 16:43.501

No, wait.
This is what I've been waiting
for!

17:03.089 --> 17:07.792
Mr. Robinson!
>> Well, Margaret, it's nice
that you finally decided to show

17:07.794 --> 17:12.030
your support for me tonight.
>> [ Muttering ]
>> What do you mean you're only

17:12.032 --> 17:15.967
coming to see me fail?
>> Gumball: But, Mr. Robinson,
you can't go to the talent show

17:15.969 --> 17:18.803

>> Anais: Okay, Darwin, here's

17:37.424 --> 17:41.392
the plan.

Got it?
>> Darwin: Got it!

17:54.741 --> 17:57.842
We drop these heavy sandbags
onto Mr. Robinson's head.
>> Anais: No!

17:57.844 --> 18:01.045
We don't actually hit
Mr. Robinson.
>> Darwin: Hit Mr. Robinson.

18:01.047 --> 18:05.383
Okay. I understand.
>> Anais: Maybe i should try
reverse psychology.

18:05.385 --> 18:10.788
Okay, Darwin.
The plan is we throw all this
stuff at Mr. Robinson's head.

18:10.790 --> 18:13.791
>> Darwin: That's what i just
said.
>> Anais: Ugh!

18:13.793 --> 18:15.927
