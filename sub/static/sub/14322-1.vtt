WEBVTT

00:01.250 --> 00:02.625
[theme music playing]

00:30.083 --> 00:32.291
[crowd clamoring]

00:32.291 --> 00:34.708
[cop 1] This is two-baker-ten,
we're on the scene,
request a backup, over.

00:34.708 --> 00:37.000
This kind of thing
ain't supposed to
happen here.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.500
Stinking muties.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.416
[metal ripping]

00:41.416 --> 00:43.000
[roaring]

00:43.000 --> 00:45.458
Two-baker-ten, we need that
backup, now!

00:46.750 --> 00:48.500
[roaring]

00:51.333 --> 00:54.750
Not again! Why doesn't
Sabretooth get a life?

00:54.750 --> 00:58.875
I fear Sabretooth's
rages are at times,
beyond his control.

00:58.875 --> 01:02.750
Like Wolverine
would be, if he knew
we were after Sabretooth.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.416
Which is precisely why

01:04.416 --> 01:07.000
Professor Xavier
did not want him
accompanying us.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.958
Dealing with one
crazed combatant
is challenge enough.

01:09.958 --> 01:11.166
[Sabretooth exclaiming]

01:11.166 --> 01:12.500
[police sirens wailing]

01:19.000 --> 01:20.458
[Sabretooth roaring]

01:20.458 --> 01:22.458
Put me down!
Put me down!

01:26.208 --> 01:30.250
I find tranquilizing gas
eminently preferable to
physical aggression.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.875
And it tends to
be much gentler
on the citizenry.

01:32.875 --> 01:34.625
[crowd coughing]

01:34.625 --> 01:37.291
Though somehow I doubt
Sabretooth will thank us

01:37.291 --> 01:38.833
for his timely abduction.

01:41.083 --> 01:45.083
Our detention facilities are
adequate to hold Sabretooth
for the short term.

01:45.083 --> 01:47.208
But we cannot keep
him here indefinitely.

01:47.208 --> 01:51.083
[Xavier] Agreed.
If I cannot get
through to him this time,

01:51.083 --> 01:52.875
we shall turn him over
to the authorities,

01:52.875 --> 01:55.125
but I must first
try to help.

01:55.125 --> 01:58.083
Uh, don't you think
we ought to tell
Wolverine?

01:58.083 --> 02:02.166
I know of no way to
explain Sabretooth's
presence to him

02:02.166 --> 02:04.125
that won't start a war.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.291
I would not be concerned,
Jubilee.

02:06.291 --> 02:10.208
The sedative will keep
Sabretooth asleep for
another eight hours.

02:10.208 --> 02:12.208
We can discuss it
in the morning.

02:25.833 --> 02:26.875
[computer buzzing]

02:36.416 --> 02:38.708
Beast says with
what he gave him,

02:38.708 --> 02:41.875
Sabretooth won't
be up for hours. Oops.

02:41.875 --> 02:44.583
[groaning] Where is he?

02:45.375 --> 02:47.500
Don't worry,
Wolverine,
it's okay!

02:47.500 --> 02:49.166
We got him locked
up in the basement.

02:49.166 --> 02:51.000
-The Professor's gonna...
-No!

02:51.000 --> 02:53.083
The Professor's
in the gym!

02:53.083 --> 02:54.750
Oh, no.

02:54.750 --> 02:56.333
[metallic clanking]

03:02.708 --> 03:05.125
Professor,
we gotta talk.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.125
It seems that
you have heard.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.250
You know how I feel.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.708
You want him breathing,
get him out of here.

03:11.708 --> 03:16.375
As long as Sabretooth
is in our custody,
he is under my protection.

03:16.375 --> 03:20.333
If you want to attack
him, you will have
to deal with me.

03:21.708 --> 03:22.958
[groaning]

03:22.958 --> 03:26.083
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry!

03:26.083 --> 03:27.333
[groaning]

03:28.875 --> 03:33.000
All right.
But I warned you before,
and nobody listened.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.833
If he stays, he gets
me as a babysitter.

03:36.833 --> 03:39.750
I'd prefer it if
you'd get some rest.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.958
I'd prefer that, too,

03:41.958 --> 03:43.208
but it ain't gonna happen.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.708
[computer beeping]

04:00.166 --> 04:04.000
Look who finally got up
off his lazy hind end,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.208
and decided to
pay me a visit.

04:06.208 --> 04:09.000
You got it all wrong.
I was busy,

04:09.000 --> 04:11.208
dreaming about
taking you apart.

04:11.208 --> 04:14.875
Gee, I was dreaming
about that sweet
little frail of yours,

04:14.875 --> 04:18.458
what's her name,
Silver Fox?

04:18.458 --> 04:20.875
You low-life piece of...
Hold it!

04:21.500 --> 04:23.291
[sniffing]

04:23.291 --> 04:25.416
I don't know
who you are, bub,

04:25.416 --> 04:27.708
or how you know
what you know,

04:27.708 --> 04:29.875
but you ain't Sabretooth!

04:29.875 --> 04:31.958
I don't care whose skin
you're wearing, bub...

04:31.958 --> 04:33.458
[metallic clinking]

04:33.458 --> 04:36.208
...but I'm dying to find
out what's inside.

04:36.208 --> 04:39.625
Whenever you're ready,
little man!

04:39.625 --> 04:42.291
[roaring]

04:42.291 --> 04:45.750
[Mr. Sinister]
Xavier, can you read me?
They're everywhere!

04:45.750 --> 04:48.458
They're inside the walls!

04:48.458 --> 04:50.208
Who are you?
I'm not reading you.

04:50.208 --> 04:52.166
Your transmission
is breaking up.

04:52.166 --> 04:56.625
Xavier, are you hearing me?
You're in great danger!

04:56.625 --> 05:00.083
I'm realigning
the antenna array,
boosting power.

05:01.291 --> 05:03.500
Professor, can you hear me?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.208
Sinister, what?

05:05.208 --> 05:09.458
Xavier, you must help me!
This thing...

05:09.458 --> 05:11.750
What's happening?

05:11.750 --> 05:15.125
A being of immense
power has attacked
my base of operations.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.583
My men are all captured,
destroyed.

05:17.583 --> 05:23.000
This being causes infection,
it's spreading.
You must stop it!

05:23.000 --> 05:27.708
We'll do everything
we can once we analyze
the nature of this thing!

05:27.708 --> 05:32.125
There is no time for analysis!
The creature consumes matter!

05:32.125 --> 05:35.458
It can take on any form!
You cannot wait.

05:35.458 --> 05:38.083
Professor, behind you!

05:38.083 --> 05:39.250
What the...

05:39.875 --> 05:41.458
[screaming]

05:42.625 --> 05:46.500
Professor! Professor!
Professor!

05:47.458 --> 05:49.458
[jazz music playing]

05:59.458 --> 06:00.750
[exclaiming]

06:07.208 --> 06:10.250
Target identified.
McCoy, Henry.

06:12.875 --> 06:14.000
[wall crashing]

06:14.958 --> 06:16.125
[groaning]

06:18.125 --> 06:19.458
[thumping]

06:23.708 --> 06:26.583
Hmm. Not our usual
evening visitor.

06:45.250 --> 06:49.333
Fascinating. It moves
through solid matter
like I move through air.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.583
Oh, my stars!

06:56.750 --> 06:58.416
[groaning]

06:58.416 --> 06:59.458
Logan!

06:59.958 --> 07:01.250
Hank!

07:02.291 --> 07:04.458
[groaning]

07:05.458 --> 07:06.583
I am coming, Logan!

07:09.166 --> 07:10.875
No! Hank! Don't!

07:10.875 --> 07:12.875
[groans]

07:12.875 --> 07:17.750
Get out of here, Hank!
You gotta... Get help!
Get...

07:22.291 --> 07:23.583
Logan!

07:34.333 --> 07:37.458
Do not resist, mutant.
You will be assimilated.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.291
Perhaps.
But not this night.

07:40.875 --> 07:42.000
[explosion]

07:46.250 --> 07:48.083
A sample may prove useful.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.166
[gasping]

07:51.250 --> 07:53.583
There must be some sort
of neuro-chemical signal

07:53.583 --> 07:55.166
linking the
individual units!

07:55.166 --> 07:56.833
[government agent] Dr. McCoy,

07:56.833 --> 08:00.833
move away from the house.
Leave the situation to us.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.875
We need to debrief you.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.333
Very well, but I...

08:06.333 --> 08:09.166
No vehicles?
Then how did
they arrive?

08:16.958 --> 08:20.375
Under the circumstances,
I am sure Logan
will understand.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.583
[car engine starting]

08:31.583 --> 08:35.250
Relatively slow-moving.
I should easily
outdistance it.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.375
Negative.
Accelerate!
Accelerate!

08:38.583 --> 08:39.958
[car tires screeching]

08:40.708 --> 08:45.708
Do not be alarmed.
Self is friend.
Ally. On your side.

08:47.708 --> 08:49.958
Who, what are you?

08:51.708 --> 08:54.250
[Warlock] No time for
introductions! Drive!

09:13.000 --> 09:16.333
Self hopes
Self-friend Beast
had light supper.

09:16.333 --> 09:17.708
[Beast] My word!

09:18.708 --> 09:20.708
[Phalanx] Acquisition
of McCoy delayed.

09:20.708 --> 09:23.416
Remaining mutants
ready for transport.

09:23.416 --> 09:25.875
I believe some
introduction
is in order.

09:25.875 --> 09:29.958
Affirmative. Self is...
I am called Warlock.

09:29.958 --> 09:31.500
It is not a name,
but a title.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.708
I am heir apparent
of the Phalanx,

09:34.708 --> 09:38.375
a cluster some 37.5
light years distant.

09:38.375 --> 09:41.416
What it cannot assimilate,
it destroys.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.333
As I neared maturity,

09:44.333 --> 09:46.583
the time when I would
forever merge with
the Phalanx,

09:46.583 --> 09:49.708
I realized I had no
heart for conquest.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.708
My Lifemate felt as I did.

09:52.708 --> 09:56.125
Together, we broke free
and fled the Phalanx.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.000
As we searched
for a new home,
our ship became damaged.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
[metallic thumping]

10:02.000 --> 10:05.500
I struggled to
regain control,
but I could not.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.083
Our ship crashed
on your Earth.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.833
When I awoke here,
I could not find
my Lifemate.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.416
I feared the worst.

10:21.625 --> 10:26.125
Men came. Many men,
with vehicles and machines.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.750
They took our ship.

10:29.250 --> 10:32.125
And Self was too
afraid to help her.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.333
Now Phalanx has
followed us here,

10:37.333 --> 10:40.000
and your world
will be lost.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.750
Self is ashamed.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.708
[Beast]
There is no need to be.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.250
Our world is not lost yet.

10:46.250 --> 10:48.500
Land on that roof
over there.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.208
Self followed men's
trucks to a laboratory,

10:52.208 --> 10:54.500
but there was no
sign of Lifemate.

10:54.500 --> 10:58.125
Until Self
followed her energy
pattern to your home.

10:58.125 --> 11:01.500
You mean that creature
is your Lifemate?

11:01.500 --> 11:04.875
No! Yes. In part.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.625
The Phalanx has her now.

11:06.625 --> 11:09.583
Has done something to her.
Something horrible.

11:09.583 --> 11:12.416
Query-- will you help us,
McCoy? Please?

11:12.416 --> 11:14.375
Perhaps we can
help each other.

11:14.375 --> 11:16.291
I have a lab in
this building.

11:16.291 --> 11:19.416
I would like to
examine a sample
of your tissue.

11:20.250 --> 11:21.833
[buttons beeping]

11:21.833 --> 11:23.875
We are fortunate
that it is after-hours.

11:24.458 --> 11:27.000
Query-- why is
this fortunate?

11:27.000 --> 11:30.083
I fear your
appearance might
alarm the staff.

11:30.083 --> 11:32.291
Then Self will
change appearance.

11:33.875 --> 11:36.958
[exclaiming] Of course.
This way.

11:38.458 --> 11:43.000
Astonishing.
Assimilation occurs rapidly
in metallic substances,

11:43.000 --> 11:45.458
but more slowly
in non-metals.

11:45.458 --> 11:48.000
Living tissues are
also assimilated
quickly,

11:48.000 --> 11:50.875
yet mutant tissue
seems somehow immune.

11:50.875 --> 11:54.333
Does this assimilation
occur independent of
conscious thought?

11:54.333 --> 11:56.291
Oh, no,
Self-friend Hank!

11:56.291 --> 12:00.583
As with the Phalanx,
every part of Self
thinks and feels.

12:00.583 --> 12:03.708
Query-- if Self-friend
Hank is finished,

12:03.708 --> 12:06.000
may Self reintegrate
the sample?

12:06.000 --> 12:08.291
Well, yes, if you like.

12:10.458 --> 12:13.958
Extraordinary!
Do that again, please!

12:17.000 --> 12:20.708
Of course!
The rate of the assimilation
is directly proportional

12:20.708 --> 12:23.000
to the substance's
electrical conductivity.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.291
Query-- what is
Self-friend Hank
talking about?

12:26.750 --> 12:30.875
[Beast]
The assimilation process is
an electromagnetic phenomenon.

12:30.875 --> 12:33.333
That would explain
how the Phalanx
was able to travel

12:33.333 --> 12:35.166
so quickly along the fence.

12:35.166 --> 12:39.583
It could transmit
its mass along any
good conductor,

12:39.583 --> 12:44.375
railroad tracks, power lines,
phone lines. Good heavens!

12:44.375 --> 12:47.416
This thing could be
far more dangerous
than we realized!

12:47.416 --> 12:50.250
Query--
what is Self-friend...

12:50.250 --> 12:53.000
I am patching in
to President Kelly's
emergency line.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.166
He must be alerted
to the danger!

12:55.166 --> 12:57.416
Dr. McCoy.
What's the trouble?

12:57.416 --> 13:00.833
Mr. President,
I must warn you
of a grave threat.

13:00.833 --> 13:05.333
Don't say any more, Doctor.
This may not be a secure line.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.875
What's your location?

13:06.875 --> 13:09.000
The Grace Eye Clinic
in New York City.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.125
We'll send a chopper
to pick both of you up.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.958
Be on the roof in
10 minutes. Kelly out.

13:13.958 --> 13:17.750
Self-friend Hank.
You did not tell
the President about Self.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.958
We can explain
the situation
when we arrive.

13:19.958 --> 13:21.708
-Right now we must...
-Query--

13:21.708 --> 13:24.583
then what did the President
mean by both of us?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.208
[explosion]

13:38.000 --> 13:41.750
Self-friend Hank,
your President is
no longer human.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.583
The patients!

13:43.583 --> 13:47.291
Self-friend Hank.
We cannot help
them by ourselves!

13:47.291 --> 13:51.000
No, we cannot.
But who can
we turn to?

13:51.000 --> 13:53.208
My specialty is
organic chemistry.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.333
But the Phalanx is
as much inorganic
as organic.

13:56.333 --> 14:00.125
Of course!
I only pray we are not
too late in reaching him.

14:00.125 --> 14:03.833
Query-- will not
a transmission
reveal our location?

14:03.833 --> 14:06.750
Not if I direct it through
a few relay satellites.

14:06.750 --> 14:10.958
Dr. McCoy, I wish I could
say I'm happy to see you,
but for some reason,

14:10.958 --> 14:15.000
a visit from the X-Men
is usually more trouble
than it is worth.

14:15.000 --> 14:18.333
I'm afraid this time
will be no different,
Forge.

14:18.333 --> 14:22.000
I believe all life on
Earth may be at risk.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.750
Can we meet somewhere safe?

14:23.750 --> 14:26.000
If this is your idea
of a joke, McCoy...

14:26.000 --> 14:27.875
I only wish it were.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.750
Milford Township.
Sid's Grill on Oakhurst.

14:30.750 --> 14:31.875
One hour.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.375
Agreed. Trust no one.

14:34.375 --> 14:35.958
Not even your own team.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.000
Understood.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.333
You said you could
sense your Lifemate's
energy pattern.

14:40.333 --> 14:43.500
Affirmative.
Self could not
forget her pattern,

14:43.500 --> 14:45.500
even as Phalanx.

14:45.500 --> 14:48.416
Then could you tell if
Forge is really Forge?

14:48.416 --> 14:51.250
Affirmative.
But only in person.

14:51.250 --> 14:54.708
[sighs] I guess we
need to be thankful
for small favors.

14:58.416 --> 15:02.750
[Hodge] Unfortunately, there
has been little progress in
mutant assimilation.

15:02.750 --> 15:04.875
The X-factor in their
genetic structure

15:04.875 --> 15:07.166
is resistant to the
assimilation process.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.583
Work continues
on the Spire.

15:09.583 --> 15:12.250
[Nucleus] The Spire is
of primary importance.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.166
Mutant assimilation serves
only to accelerate

15:15.166 --> 15:17.500
completion of
the primary Phalanx.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
Once that has
been accomplished,

15:19.500 --> 15:22.708
all Phalanx will
rejoin the nexus.

15:22.708 --> 15:25.375
Random genetic
reproduction
will cease,

15:25.375 --> 15:31.250
and at last, all life
on this world will attain
the perfection of the Phalanx.

15:32.583 --> 15:33.708
[car doors closing]

15:36.958 --> 15:38.333
Please don't do that.

15:38.333 --> 15:40.416
Sorry.

15:40.416 --> 15:44.000
Both beings are human,
though Forge has
inorganic components.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.083
Additional being
is fully biological.

15:47.083 --> 15:50.208
Additional?
Well, as long
as he's human.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
[Beast] Quicksilver!

16:10.000 --> 16:13.750
He seems to think
the base personnel
are acting strangely.

16:13.750 --> 16:14.875
Is he right?

16:14.875 --> 16:16.708
Quite probably.

16:16.708 --> 16:18.708
This young man
is Warlock.

16:18.708 --> 16:21.375
We have discovered
something disturbing.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.625
It began roughly
12 hours ago.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.458
And we waited
until you arrived.

16:26.458 --> 16:29.333
It was the only way
to be sure you were
unaffected.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.458
You don't expect us
to believe this.

16:31.458 --> 16:35.000
Dr. McCoy isn't
given to flights
of fancy, Pietro.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.583
But couldn't this be
some elaborate ruse?

16:37.583 --> 16:39.958
We know of
any number of
mutants capable of...

16:39.958 --> 16:41.000
[crowd complaining]

16:42.333 --> 16:44.083
I know how
it must sound.

16:44.083 --> 16:47.500
But, Warlock, would you
assimilate that fork?

16:48.458 --> 16:50.708
Interesting.
And I'm afraid

16:50.708 --> 16:54.333
corroborating evidence
is standing outside.

16:54.333 --> 16:55.583
[crowd complaining]

16:59.083 --> 17:02.166
Miss, is there
a rear exit to
this establishment?

17:02.166 --> 17:04.333
There is no exit, mutant.

17:06.416 --> 17:07.833
[screaming]

17:08.250 --> 17:11.333
Lifemate, no!
Please!

17:12.750 --> 17:15.708
Warlock! Help Self!

17:17.833 --> 17:19.000
[groaning]

17:21.625 --> 17:23.583
Control link re-established.

17:25.125 --> 17:26.333
[glass shattering]

17:35.416 --> 17:36.708
[exploding]

17:38.375 --> 17:39.833
I'll bring
the van around.

17:39.833 --> 17:41.166
No, wait!

17:45.708 --> 17:48.291
Leave me! You can
travel faster alone!

17:48.291 --> 17:49.583
Not necessary!

17:52.250 --> 17:53.500
[crowd clamoring]

18:03.333 --> 18:05.291
Great spirit
protect us!

18:05.291 --> 18:07.250
Indeed. This way.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.083
Get down.

18:12.083 --> 18:13.583
-Ah!
-[exploding]

18:31.291 --> 18:34.291
Though Mr. Sinister
may seem an odd ally,

18:34.291 --> 18:39.416
the pragmatism of "the enemy
of your enemy is your friend"
seems to apply.

18:39.416 --> 18:41.250
Quickly! They're reforming!

18:43.708 --> 18:44.875
[thumping]

18:44.875 --> 18:46.583
[Beast] Go! Go!

18:59.708 --> 19:03.458
It destroyed my records,
my laboratory, my men.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.583
All gone.

19:05.583 --> 19:08.833
I have run a projection
based on what we have
observed so far.

19:08.833 --> 19:12.375
It appears that if
this Phalanx organism
proceeds unchecked,

19:12.375 --> 19:17.125
76% of the world's population
will be assimilated
within four days.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.500
-[welding device buzzing]
-[Forge] But you're
using a viral model.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.708
This thing thinks.

19:21.708 --> 19:25.625
It knew to go for the
President and it knew
to ambush us at Milford.

19:25.625 --> 19:29.000
It knows just what
and when to infect.

19:29.000 --> 19:32.458
True, but the range
of its control seems
limited.

19:32.458 --> 19:35.875
In the diner,
that portion of it
seemed to revert briefly.

19:35.875 --> 19:39.875
Perhaps it needs
a larger transmitter
to extend its range.

19:39.875 --> 19:43.250
Something like that,
for instance?

19:46.958 --> 19:48.500
[Warlock] It is the Spire!

19:49.416 --> 19:52.750
The Phalanx will
use it to summon
the rest of my people!

19:52.750 --> 19:55.750
To add this planet
to the Phalanx empire!

19:57.875 --> 20:01.833
It is Self's fault.
Self never should
have come here.

20:02.375 --> 20:06.333
Now, Self-friends,
Beast, Forge,

20:06.333 --> 20:09.833
your world is doomed!

20:16.625 --> 20:20.458
You and me. We're gonna be
together like it was always
meant to be.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.416
Everything's gonna be okay.

20:23.416 --> 20:25.125
[crackling]

20:25.125 --> 20:28.083
-[gasps] What's that?
-Shh.

20:31.416 --> 20:33.583
Ha ha. Oh, Cody.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.416
Cody, I can touch you!
It's true!

20:36.416 --> 20:37.958
[sighs]

20:37.958 --> 20:39.833
What have I done?

20:40.250 --> 20:42.166
[intense music playing]
