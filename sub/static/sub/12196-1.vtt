00:15.016 --> 00:18.183
- When I was a little girl,
my mother used to tell

00:18.185 --> 00:20.953
me story about a princess
who lived on a beautiful

00:20.955 --> 00:23.789
island surrounded
by turquoise waters

00:23.791 --> 00:26.325
where the sky kissed the sea.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.527
When the princess
met her prince,

00:28.529 --> 00:31.130
their love grew stronger
than the waves crashing

00:31.132 --> 00:33.198
against the shore.

00:33.200 --> 00:37.302
So when I met Jack
one day on the beach,

00:37.304 --> 00:40.639
he was everything I
had been searching for.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.475
I thought it was fate.

00:43.477 --> 00:47.379
But I had forgotten
something very important.

00:47.381 --> 00:51.483
Every fairy tale has a monster.

00:51.485 --> 00:56.555
In my life story, the monster's
name was Gan Cerrancurie.

00:56.991 --> 00:59.525
A man whom I later
found out was a ruthless

00:59.527 --> 01:01.427
crime lord.

01:01.429 --> 01:06.331
Little did I know, our path's
were destined to collide.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.454
(gun shot)

01:28.789 --> 01:31.523
(gun shots)

01:48.242 --> 01:52.044
- Now, a little Birdy
told me you're very bitter

01:52.046 --> 01:57.116
about land deals that
happened between our families.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.618
Where supposedly my
family got land that

01:59.620 --> 02:01.553
belongs to you.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.322
You have to understand,

02:03.324 --> 02:05.657
that wasn't me.

02:05.659 --> 02:10.095
- I should have squashed
you a long time ago,

02:10.097 --> 02:11.930
when I had a chance.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.499
- Let's bury the hatchet.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.967
- No.

02:14.969 --> 02:19.538
In Cambodia, there is not
enough room for the both of us.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.908
- That means one
of us has to die.

02:22.910 --> 02:26.879
- We will leave it to fate.

02:27.515 --> 02:29.915
(groaning)

02:33.654 --> 02:35.787
- You were always a cheat.

02:35.789 --> 02:38.357
- In matters of life and death,

02:38.359 --> 02:40.993
there is no cheating.

02:40.995 --> 02:43.996
Just living and dying.

02:43.998 --> 02:45.430
- Who's choice of weapons.

02:45.432 --> 02:46.665
- High sword.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.201
Winner take all.

02:49.203 --> 02:51.303
- Well that puts me
at a disadvantage

02:51.305 --> 02:55.007
because you're a master of
the knives and the swords.

02:55.009 --> 02:57.976
Maybe I'll survive.

02:57.978 --> 03:00.846
Maybe I will get lucky.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.548
Maybe not.

03:09.657 --> 03:12.391
(swords clanging)

03:24.171 --> 03:27.206
(swords clanging)

03:41.322 --> 03:45.123
(groaning)

03:52.066 --> 03:54.433
You're out of practice,
my old friend.

03:54.435 --> 03:57.102
I expected more from you.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.973
(groaning)

05:42.376 --> 05:47.012
Gentlemen, mysteriously
our competitors are gone.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.515
You all have done a great job.

05:50.517 --> 05:54.219
I just want to say that
violence is the last resort

05:54.221 --> 05:57.356
because it attracts
a lot of attention,

05:57.358 --> 05:59.925
but when we have no choice,
we're pretty good at it.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.361
(speaking a foreign language)

06:11.839 --> 06:13.505
Good job.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.440
Celebrate.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.399
- Ok, Sam.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.434
Bank's around the corner,
man, are you ready?

06:42.436 --> 06:44.269
- I know what time it is, Jack.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.638
- Just try not to shoot me
with that thing, ok pal?

06:48.609 --> 06:50.575
Jesus Christ.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.378
- Hold on.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.180
- Can we go now?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.515
- Let's go.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.716
- Everybody freeze.

06:57.718 --> 06:58.850
If you don't speak English.

06:58.852 --> 07:00.051
(gun shots)

07:00.053 --> 07:01.286
- Don't even think about it.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.287
Down.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.389
(speaking a foreign language)

07:04.391 --> 07:05.590
- Cooperate with us
and nobody gets hurt.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.925
You, manager.

07:06.927 --> 07:10.595
Open, open, open, out, out, out.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.633
- One minute.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.401
- Come on, man.

07:16.403 --> 07:19.504
Go, go, go, go.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.978
- Keep down.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.617
Move.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.221
- Ok, we're good,
get out of here.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.256
- A minute forty five, go.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.391
(gun shot)

07:39.393 --> 07:40.492
You (speaking in a
foreign language)

07:40.494 --> 07:42.494
- Come on, man.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.467
- Holy shit.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.801
What do they do with
all this US currency?

08:56.803 --> 08:59.204
I mean, this is like a
crazy amount of money.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.805
- How much money do
you think that is?

09:00.807 --> 09:01.840
- I haven't got a clue,

09:01.842 --> 09:03.475
I've been busy.

09:03.477 --> 09:04.476
- What would a small
bank in Cambodia

09:04.478 --> 09:06.011
have this much cash, man?

09:06.013 --> 09:07.345
- Stop complaining,
we scored, mate.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.813
We scored.

09:08.815 --> 09:09.514
- I'm not complaining,
what if they check the bags

09:09.516 --> 09:10.749
on the border?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.051
- Trust me, they won't.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.221
- Good thing, I brought this.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.689
- Great.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.524
You expect us to
tape this amount

09:19.526 --> 09:21.159
of cash to our bodies?

09:21.161 --> 09:22.894
- Tough guy like you
scared of some tape?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.563
- It's not the taping
I'm worried about.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.731
It's taking it off, my son.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.333
Taking it off.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.434
- You're a harry bastard, man.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.570
It'll do you some good.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.673
- Jesus Christ.

09:37.544 --> 09:39.511
You're always trying
to call that chick.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.413
You need to get a life, mate.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.081
- She is my life, man.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.382
- You're so whipped.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.017
Is that why you're doing this?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.452
- Maybe.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.954
What's it to you?

09:48.956 --> 09:51.189
- It just makes me nervous
working with such a pussy.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.024
- Whatever, man.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.593
Let's get you taped up.

09:54.595 --> 09:56.461
- No, no, no, after you, mate.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.762
Turn around and bend over.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.397
- Get off of me, you fucker.

09:59.399 --> 10:00.532
This is serious.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.767
Just fucking tape me.

10:07.074 --> 10:10.609
(tense music)

11:00.460 --> 11:01.826
Thank you.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.561
- Thank you kindly.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.600
(slow serene music)

11:50.911 --> 11:52.243
- Hey, baby.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.478
- Hey you.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.714
- Want to do me a favor
and ditch that thing?

11:55.716 --> 11:58.016
- I just started work.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.085
- You just finished work.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.586
Believe me.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.495
- [Girl] My mother
died when I was young

12:10.497 --> 12:13.198
but she taught me not to
take shortcuts in life.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.433
When I got older, I
didn't go for the quick

12:15.435 --> 12:18.703
cash in go-go bars like
some other girls I knew.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.539
Jack and I were working
towards our dream

12:21.541 --> 12:23.775
so that some day we
can live on a beautiful

12:23.777 --> 12:26.411
island together.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.219
Can I open my eyes yet?

12:34.221 --> 12:36.354
- No, not yet.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.922
I'll tell you when it's ok.

12:52.472 --> 12:53.872
Ok.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.607
Open them.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.642
(gasp)

12:58.411 --> 13:02.180
- It's the one that I saw from
the store window last week.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.384
I love it.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.319
Really, I do.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.555
But honey, we can't afford this.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.458
- That's the surprise part.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.293
Come here.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.628
Let me show you something.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.263
Come on, baby.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.365
Come on.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.168
Look.

13:23.170 --> 13:23.935
- Oh my god.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.570
What is that?

13:25.572 --> 13:27.105
- That is why you
don't have to work

13:27.107 --> 13:29.007
at the club anymore, Avalon.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.309
And it's all yours.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.412
- I don't understand.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.780
Where did you get it?

13:35.782 --> 13:37.448
- Don't ask me where or how

13:37.450 --> 13:39.651
or why.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.420
I'll tell you why.

13:42.422 --> 13:45.490
It's because I love you.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.193
I want you to stick around.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.628
- I'm not going anywhere.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.830
I love you.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.932
Don't you know that?

13:53.934 --> 13:54.866
You have to tell
me where you got

13:54.868 --> 13:57.035
all this money.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.469
- Avalon, honey, I'm serious.

13:58.471 --> 14:00.438
It's better that
you just don't know.

14:00.440 --> 14:04.309
- So, how do I explain
where I got it?

14:04.311 --> 14:07.879
- You can't explain
this to anybody, ok?

14:07.881 --> 14:10.381
Now, honey, I'm not
telling you what to do,

14:10.383 --> 14:12.951
but we can't spend this
money right now, ok?

14:12.953 --> 14:15.320
Maybe we can have a little fun,

14:15.322 --> 14:17.522
but I'm going to put most
of it away somewhere safe.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.325
- You're crazy, you know that?

14:20.327 --> 14:23.628
- I'm crazy for you.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.398
- You know what we should do?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.533
- What?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.635
- We should go on holiday.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.237
To an island.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.072
Like where we met.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.074
- Anything you want, baby doll.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.714
I'm going to go clean up, ok?

14:42.716 --> 14:44.315
I'll be right back.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.750
Don't go anywhere.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.788
(sighing)

15:20.854 --> 15:23.454
- I think you've
been naughty, Jack.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.957
- Oh yeah?

15:25.959 --> 15:28.026
Is it naughty time?

15:28.028 --> 15:30.895
Woah, woah, baby
that's not a toy.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.531
- You didn't tell me
you had a gun, Jack.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.365
- It slipped my mind.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.566
Don't point that.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.302
- Don't worry so much.

15:37.304 --> 15:39.404
The safety is on.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.607
Come here.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.711
Why don't you...

15:50.150 --> 15:53.184
Do me on all of this cash.

15:56.389 --> 15:59.524
Don't me ask you twice, Jack.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.929
(giggling)

16:04.931 --> 16:07.231
- Yes, ma'am.

16:07.233 --> 16:11.369
(giggling)

16:21.448 --> 16:24.082
- What kind of flower is that?

16:25.418 --> 16:28.286
- This is called a (speaking
a foreign language),

16:28.288 --> 16:30.788
it's known as the
rose of compassion.

16:30.790 --> 16:32.523
It's a climbing tea rose,

16:32.525 --> 16:34.525
kind of common but
I've always loved it.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.794
My momma used to grow
these in America.

16:36.796 --> 16:38.629
- Do you miss America?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.431
- This is my home.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.867
I came to Asia
quite a while back

16:42.869 --> 16:45.503
and fell in love
with this place.

16:45.505 --> 16:48.206
Just something I
believe in here.

16:55.849 --> 16:58.016
- The bank with your
money was robbed.

16:58.018 --> 17:00.651
They got away with about
200,000 US dollars.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.388
Most of it was yours.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.856
- Can I ask you a question?

17:04.858 --> 17:06.391
Aren't you the mother
fucker that told me

17:06.393 --> 17:09.127
that that's the safest
place to put my money?

17:09.128 --> 17:10.728
- Yes, sir.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.696
- You said it would be safe.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.465
You know, I took your advice.

17:15.468 --> 17:20.505
So if I were you, I
would get my money back.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.006
- It shouldn't be difficult.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.241
It was marked.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.575
- I don't want to
hear any stories about

17:24.577 --> 17:26.577
how easy it's going to be.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.514
I want to hear that
we got it back.

17:29.516 --> 17:30.815
I want results or I'll
take these fucking

17:30.817 --> 17:32.917
rose clippers and bury
them into somebody's

17:32.919 --> 17:35.520
mother fucking eye.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.622
- Yes, sir.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.772
- Yeah, yeah.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.540
Seriously, next time
you can't come in

18:29.542 --> 18:31.109
shooting the place
up like that, man.

18:31.111 --> 18:33.044
No need, it's too much.

18:33.046 --> 18:36.147
- You're thinking
about doing it again?

18:36.149 --> 18:39.417
- Thinking about it.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.586
- I'm up for another
run across the border.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.421
- Yeah.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.455
We were good right?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.591
- Fuck yeah.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.759
- I guess all those video
games finally paid off.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.561
- I'm all about the money, baby.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.096
- Big time.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.798
Especially after taking
so much shit for so long.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.800
It's nice to have
some real cash.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.636
- I'm going to buy myself
a new set of wheels.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.071
- Woah, woah, woah.

19:00.073 --> 19:01.405
Don't do anything crazy, Sam.

19:01.407 --> 19:02.507
We've got to let
that money cool off

19:02.509 --> 19:03.741
for a little while.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.009
- A man's got to have
some fun you know.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.677
- I'm just saying,
don't be stupid.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.247
- Be careful who
you're calling stupid.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.585
- Just looking out
for both of us, man.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.987
All right, go have some fun.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.588
Just don't go crazy.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.690
All right?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.192
I've got lunch.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.627
I've got to split, see you, pal.

19:22.629 --> 19:24.529
- See you later.

19:40.547 --> 19:41.679
- Yeah.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.281
Sam told me about this place.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.683
It's not too bad, right?

19:45.685 --> 19:48.352
- Oh my gosh, this
place is amazing.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.554
- You deserve
nothing less, babe.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.521
- Thank you.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.156
- Thank you.

19:52.158 --> 19:52.957
Cheers.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.892
- Cheers.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.600
- Oh wow.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.535
Baby, some of the cash
we're going to have

20:04.537 --> 20:06.170
to start putting in
your bank account.

20:06.172 --> 20:08.239
No more than a few
thousand dollars at a time.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.207
Ok?

20:09.209 --> 20:10.474
- Well, honey, what about you?

20:10.476 --> 20:12.677
I want you to have
some of this money too.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.312
- Don't worry about me.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.581
I took a little off
the top for expenses.

20:16.583 --> 20:19.016
Now if you want to take me
out to dinner a few times,

20:19.018 --> 20:22.653
or go on vacation,
I won't stop you.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.124
- Jack?

20:29.696 --> 20:32.496
We're not in any danger
because of this are we?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.934
- No, babe.

20:36.936 --> 20:41.539
Avalon, you're safe with me, ok?

20:41.541 --> 20:44.375
Swear to God, I'll
do anything I have to

20:44.377 --> 20:46.244
to make sure you're
taken care of.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.846
I promise.

20:52.218 --> 20:55.286
- [Avalon] I know that Jack
only wanted the best for me,

20:55.288 --> 20:58.289
but there are always
consequences for our actions.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.615
(whistling)

21:35.628 --> 21:38.496
(breathing heavily)

21:41.668 --> 21:44.302
- Hello, Jack.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.337
One of my two (speaking
foreign language).

21:46.339 --> 21:48.606
- Who the fuck are you?

21:48.608 --> 21:51.609
- My name is Neeron Mortima.

21:51.611 --> 21:55.313
I'm your new best friend.

21:56.316 --> 21:58.082
- That's ok, pal.

21:58.084 --> 21:59.950
I don't like the friends I have.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.253
I don't need another one.

22:02.255 --> 22:04.588
- Really?

22:07.260 --> 22:09.493
That's funny.

22:09.495 --> 22:13.531
(groaning)

22:18.304 --> 22:20.504
Because the way I see it,

22:20.506 --> 22:22.540
you could use one
right about now.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.179
- What are you, a cop?

22:28.181 --> 22:30.514
- There you go,
calling me names.

22:34.454 --> 22:36.620
(groaning)

22:36.622 --> 22:38.689
Hold on to that.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.129
That was a lot of
money you took from the

22:45.131 --> 22:47.398
bank in Cambodia.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.501
Especially for
such a small town.

22:50.503 --> 22:54.705
And all of that US currency.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.609
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

22:59.379 --> 23:01.011
- The butter.

23:01.013 --> 23:02.747
Is it helping?

23:02.749 --> 23:04.749
- Yeah, actually it
does help a little.

23:08.588 --> 23:12.690
- I am getting really mad
now with this bullshit.

23:12.692 --> 23:17.762
The money, asshole.

23:21.501 --> 23:24.969
I found it in the closet.

23:25.772 --> 23:28.305
- How'd you find me?

23:29.609 --> 23:31.208
- It's all marked and you were

23:31.210 --> 23:33.911
so eager to exchange
it that it showed

23:33.913 --> 23:36.580
up on my radar real quick.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.616
Now...

23:39.619 --> 23:41.852
This is how it's going to work.

23:41.854 --> 23:43.754
I'm going to give you
the names of the banks

23:43.756 --> 23:48.092
in Cambodia that you
are going to rob.

23:50.029 --> 23:53.597
You're going to do
exactly as I tell you.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.200
- Come again?

23:56.202 --> 23:58.369
- The banks will be
guaranteed to have

23:58.371 --> 24:00.938
just as much if not
more than what you

24:00.940 --> 24:03.340
took from the first heist.

24:04.710 --> 24:09.280
For my service, I get 50
percent of everything.

24:10.316 --> 24:12.616
And unfortunately for you today,

24:12.618 --> 24:15.419
you and your partner have
already split the money.

24:15.421 --> 24:18.823
And while you were out,
I took my 50 percent.

24:18.825 --> 24:21.325
That kind of wipes you out.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.934
- I'm not doing this.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.402
- Of course.

24:31.404 --> 24:33.938
I knew you were
going to say that.

24:33.940 --> 24:36.040
So here's the other option.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.345
You played a dangerous
game and the rules

24:41.347 --> 24:42.780
have changed.

24:42.782 --> 24:44.482
- Wait, wait, ok wait.

24:44.484 --> 24:46.317
- No, you know what?

24:46.319 --> 24:48.853
I think I'll just talk to
your boyfriend and maybe

24:48.855 --> 24:52.456
he will recognize the
generosity of my terms.

24:52.458 --> 24:54.658
(muffled speaking)

24:54.660 --> 24:57.161
What?

24:57.163 --> 25:00.331
I'm sorry, you want
to say something?

25:00.333 --> 25:02.867
- I'll do it.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.768
I'll do it.

25:07.173 --> 25:08.839
- See Jack?

25:08.841 --> 25:11.375
Best friends.

25:12.678 --> 25:15.312
I have a little
something for you.

25:15.314 --> 25:17.548
Keep it close.

25:17.550 --> 25:20.050
I'll be calling.

25:22.788 --> 25:24.488
But just in case.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.390
Your girlfriend,

25:26.392 --> 25:28.459
well I am sure that she's
going to be somebody

25:28.461 --> 25:31.962
that I will be meeting
quite intimately

25:31.964 --> 25:33.931
if you fuck with me.

25:37.570 --> 25:39.403
Take care, buddy.

25:44.176 --> 25:45.643
(door slams)

25:51.751 --> 25:53.317
- Jack.

25:53.319 --> 25:54.685
- Hey baby.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.720
Can you untie me?

25:57.690 --> 25:59.557
- Hold on, hold still.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.591
What the fuck, Jack.

26:00.593 --> 26:02.593
What happened?

26:02.595 --> 26:04.995
- Looks like I stole
from some bad guys, babe.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.900
- Are you ok?

26:09.902 --> 26:12.369
- Avalon, they took
all your money, doll.

26:12.371 --> 26:13.571
They took all the money.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.838
But it's ok, I've
got it worked out.

26:14.840 --> 26:16.340
All right, we got a deal
and I'm going to get

26:16.342 --> 26:17.575
your money back and I'm
going to get you more money.

26:17.577 --> 26:18.509
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:18.511 --> 26:19.777
Listen to me.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.245
Ok?

26:21.247 --> 26:23.547
It's only money, Jack.

26:23.549 --> 26:24.848
I'm worried about you.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.250
Are you ok?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.451
- Yeah, I'm ok.

26:27.453 --> 26:28.052
- Good.

26:28.054 --> 26:28.953
- I'm ok.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.522
Let's go to the bathroom.

26:31.524 --> 26:33.257
(coughing)

26:34.527 --> 26:35.726
I'm sorry, baby.

26:35.728 --> 26:37.695
I'm so fucking sorry.

26:47.440 --> 26:50.174
(thunder)

26:51.277 --> 26:53.277
- So you're pissed?

26:55.915 --> 26:59.049
- I think it was
crazy and stupid.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.488
But...

27:06.125 --> 27:08.425
I also think it was
kind of romantic

27:08.427 --> 27:11.629
that you robbed a
bank just for me.

27:11.631 --> 27:15.132
- I'm glad you feel
that way, babe.

27:18.571 --> 27:21.538
Because I'm going
to do it again.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.975
(sighing)

27:24.977 --> 27:27.811
- You sure about that, Jack?

27:27.813 --> 27:30.514
- I don't have a real job.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.415
If I don't do what
this guy says,

27:31.417 --> 27:32.416
I'm going to be in deep...

27:32.418 --> 27:34.418
- Shhh.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.423
Money's not important.

27:40.493 --> 27:44.595
Now, let's straighten
out the bedroom,

27:44.597 --> 27:46.530
so that I can take care of you.

28:24.236 --> 28:27.037
(phone ringing)

28:36.582 --> 28:38.082
- Yeah?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.983
- [Neeron] You ready?

28:39.985 --> 28:41.418
- Yeah, we're ready.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.587
- Listen carefully.

28:43.589 --> 28:47.524
There's a bank in the
town of Sesopoung.

28:47.526 --> 28:52.596
Next Wednesday,
exactly 2 o'clock.

28:52.898 --> 28:55.499
Not before.

28:55.501 --> 28:58.535
Not a minute later.

28:58.537 --> 28:59.703
Do you understand?

28:59.705 --> 29:00.871
- Yeah, 2 pm.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.606
Highway six.

29:02.608 --> 29:04.041
- On your way back
to the border,

29:04.043 --> 29:06.443
there's an old petrol depot.

29:06.445 --> 29:09.113
Just off of the highway.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.515
You'll see a black BMW.

29:11.517 --> 29:14.585
Go there immediately
after the job.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.354
Jack.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.857
I know exactly how much
money is in the bank.

29:19.859 --> 29:22.926
So don't try and
be wise with me.

29:22.928 --> 29:24.862
- Don't worry about it.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.802
(sighing)

29:44.450 --> 29:47.718
(quiet flute music)

30:58.123 --> 31:00.123
(buzzing)

31:00.125 --> 31:01.658
- [Intercom] Yeah?

31:01.660 --> 31:04.561
- Yo, I got to talk
to greedy Greg.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.697
Tell him it's Jack.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.516
(barking)

31:59.518 --> 32:01.051
- Shut up, Ewy.

32:01.053 --> 32:03.987
There's a courier
without a goddamn box.

32:08.060 --> 32:09.693
- Thanks for seeing
me like this, greedy.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.061
Sorry I haven't been around.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.763
- Save that shit, man.

32:12.765 --> 32:15.032
What you want?

32:15.034 --> 32:16.566
- Well this may seem
kind of strange,

32:16.568 --> 32:20.037
but over the last few
years making runs for you,

32:20.039 --> 32:22.406
I've noticed that
well, the packages,

32:22.408 --> 32:26.443
sometimes, sometimes
inside of them there's...

32:26.445 --> 32:28.578
- Yo, nigga get to the point.

32:28.580 --> 32:31.048
You see I'm doing
some shit right?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.317
I don't have time
for this bullshit.

32:33.319 --> 32:34.618
- I wanted to pick something up.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.453
- Pick something up like what?

32:36.455 --> 32:37.888
- I want to buy some heat.

32:37.890 --> 32:39.456
- Heat?

32:39.458 --> 32:41.591
- Guns, man.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.460
- I know what mother
fucking heat is.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.729
What I don't know
is who sent your

32:45.731 --> 32:48.598
1989 talking ass here for guns.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.500
- The packages, greedy.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.469
I've got to open them sometimes.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.670
Look man, you know I've
never taken anything

32:53.672 --> 32:55.472
off the top on a job.

32:55.474 --> 32:58.408
I'm only here tonight
because some of your bags,

32:58.410 --> 33:00.911
they got gun parts in them, man.

33:00.913 --> 33:02.846
Rifle rounds, large magazines.

33:02.848 --> 33:04.481
Machine gun shit.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.083
Now I've been doing
some new work lately.

33:06.085 --> 33:07.684
Some work that requires
more than a pistol

33:07.686 --> 33:08.652
and I don't know
where to get that kind

33:08.654 --> 33:11.521
of shit this side of the world.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.758
I thought maybe you could help.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.362
Look, man, maybe
this is a bad idea.

33:18.364 --> 33:19.529
I can just leave.

33:19.531 --> 33:20.931
- No, no, no you
ain't just leaving.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.432
You ain't going nowhere.

33:22.434 --> 33:24.134
You understand me?

33:24.136 --> 33:27.037
What you going to do is you
going to lift that shirt.

33:28.974 --> 33:30.474
I'm serious, man.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.075
I ain't playing with you.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.482
- I ain't wearing
a wire, greedy.

33:38.484 --> 33:41.952
I just got no where else to go.

33:45.457 --> 33:48.658
- All right, all right.

33:48.660 --> 33:52.562
I'm not one to turn away
business, you understand?

33:52.564 --> 33:54.898
Let's see what paper you've got.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.670
- American.

34:00.672 --> 34:03.373
- Now we talking.

34:03.375 --> 34:06.043
So what kind of heat you
looking for this evening?

34:06.045 --> 34:07.844
- AR 15.

34:07.846 --> 34:09.312
Beretta M9.

34:09.313 --> 34:11.047
AK, sub machine guns, shot guns,

34:11.050 --> 34:12.815
anything heavy.

34:12.818 --> 34:15.385
- All right.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.455
Let's take him upstairs, fellas.

34:30.002 --> 34:31.668
Bam.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.071
- Yeah.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.672
Yeah.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.608
Yeah, this will do.

34:42.614 --> 34:45.081
Maybe this.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.483
Definitely that.

34:47.585 --> 34:48.784
- Ok.

34:48.786 --> 34:50.786
Good choice.

34:58.630 --> 35:00.597
You know, I like you, Jack.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.866
I hope you're not getting
in over your head.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.205
- Then the guard
went for his gun,

35:08.207 --> 35:09.873
and I looked at him real mean.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.741
He knew if he
touched his pistol,

35:11.743 --> 35:13.777
I'd take him out just like that.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.745
Nobody moved after that.

35:15.747 --> 35:18.582
Until we were leaving, and
I shot the fucking shit.

35:18.584 --> 35:20.250
All right, Jack.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.718
What happened to you?

35:21.720 --> 35:22.819
- You've got a voice that
carries, you know that, pal?

35:22.821 --> 35:24.054
- I was telling Tracy or Sharon,

35:24.056 --> 35:25.555
or whatever her
fucking name is about

35:25.557 --> 35:27.290
some TV show, that's all, mate.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.025
- Can I talk to my friend?

35:29.895 --> 35:31.461
- What'd you do that for?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.930
I was about to tap
her fucking ass.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.732
- Let me talk to you outside.

35:42.007 --> 35:43.240
- What's up, Jack?

35:43.242 --> 35:44.641
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

35:44.643 --> 35:45.609
Talking about our
business in a fucking bar.

35:45.611 --> 35:46.576
Are you stupid?

35:46.578 --> 35:47.577
- Don't call me stupid.

35:47.579 --> 35:49.479
I let you get away with it once.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.148
Don't fucking test me, ok?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.616
That was Cambodia.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.817
The place can't touch us here.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.418
- We don't know that, Sam.

35:55.420 --> 35:56.686
Maybe they can.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.687
Maybe somebody wants
their money back.

35:57.689 --> 35:59.523
Did you ever think about that?

35:59.525 --> 36:01.491
- What're you trying to say?

36:01.493 --> 36:03.927
- I'm just saying,
use your head.

36:03.929 --> 36:05.462
I'm serious, man.

36:05.464 --> 36:07.497
Because we're doing it again.

36:07.499 --> 36:09.733
- Ok.

36:35.627 --> 36:38.061
- Everybody down.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.463
Get down.

36:41.567 --> 36:43.066
Everybody down.

36:43.068 --> 36:44.701
This is a robbery,
nobody fucking move.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.069
On the floor now.

36:46.071 --> 36:46.670
(gun shots)

36:46.672 --> 36:47.537
(groaning)

36:47.539 --> 36:49.406
Dammit, Sam.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.574
Fuck.

36:50.576 --> 36:51.708
You, get up, manager, go.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.009
You open the safe.

36:53.011 --> 36:53.743
Open the safe.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.345
Go, go, go.

36:55.347 --> 36:56.646
- Keep your mouth shut.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.582
Keep down, mother fuckers.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.550
- Out, out, out.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.621
Shit.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.494
(laughing)

37:14.666 --> 37:16.800
- Shut up.

37:20.572 --> 37:22.272
- All right, we're out.

37:22.274 --> 37:23.540
- Good job, Jack.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.208
You saved 15
seconds of our time.

37:25.210 --> 37:26.576
Good man.

37:26.578 --> 37:28.778
- God damn it.

37:29.581 --> 37:31.381
- Tell them it was the two
(speaking a foreign language).

37:31.383 --> 37:33.283
- Stop saying that.

37:56.541 --> 37:58.308
A little trigger happy back
there, don't you think, Sam?

37:58.310 --> 37:59.643
- That's the way it goes down.

37:59.645 --> 38:01.444
No room, no time
for nothing else.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.079
I only shot him in
the fucking leg.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.381
- That was a cell phone.

38:04.383 --> 38:05.649
- What if it wasn't?

38:05.651 --> 38:08.251
Who reaches inside their
jacket during a robbery?

38:08.253 --> 38:09.953
You told me to
cover your ass, Jack

38:09.955 --> 38:11.488
and as normal, I'm
covering your ass,

38:11.490 --> 38:13.256
and mine at the same time.

38:13.258 --> 38:14.824
- Sam, cover us, don't
shoot a mother fucker

38:14.826 --> 38:16.660
just because he moves.

38:16.662 --> 38:17.894
Do you want to kill somebody?

38:17.896 --> 38:18.962
Is that your gig?

38:18.964 --> 38:20.297
Because that's not mine.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.431
All right, we rob banks.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.466
That's it.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.902
- All right.

38:28.307 --> 38:30.073
- Now follow me.

38:30.075 --> 38:31.808
We've got to make a stop.

39:06.478 --> 39:07.477
- What're we doing here, Jack?

39:07.479 --> 39:08.778
- God damn it, Sam.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.714
Not another word till
we get back to Bangkok.

39:10.716 --> 39:12.182
All right, you're getting paid.

39:12.184 --> 39:13.550
Stay put.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.585
- Who's that in that car?

39:24.629 --> 39:25.662
- Your boyfriend.

39:25.664 --> 39:27.330
He know about us?

39:27.332 --> 39:29.172
- He knows what
he needs to know.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.135
- Nice feeling right?

39:32.137 --> 39:33.903
Taking what you want.

39:33.905 --> 39:35.739
Being in control.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.507
- I don't feel much in
control right now, Neeron.

39:37.509 --> 39:39.008
- No?

39:39.010 --> 39:40.744
All that money.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.580
And Avalon.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.548
How is she?

39:45.550 --> 39:49.152
Is she at that silly Thai
aerobics class of hers?

39:49.154 --> 39:50.320
- I swear to God.

39:50.322 --> 39:51.654
You stay the fuck away from her.

39:51.656 --> 39:53.323
- It must feel good
to have enough money

39:53.325 --> 39:55.692
to take care of this
young, hot, beautiful

39:55.694 --> 39:56.893
and sexy...

39:59.831 --> 40:01.898
Be slow, errand boy.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.867
Now ease off that.

40:03.869 --> 40:05.769
There we go.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.304
We're buddies, right?

40:09.574 --> 40:11.274
Ok.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.110
You guys were lucky last
time crossing the border.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.247
Now that I have an interest
in you not being caught,

40:17.249 --> 40:19.215
I'm going to show
you an old tunnel

40:19.217 --> 40:21.384
that we used to run
shipments through.

40:21.386 --> 40:22.752
Come on.

40:22.754 --> 40:24.687
Follow me.

40:28.960 --> 40:31.761
(intense bass music)

42:10.629 --> 42:12.161
A guard was killed.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.230
Was that necessary?

42:14.232 --> 42:16.132
- What are you
getting soft, Neeron?

42:16.134 --> 42:17.767
What's it matter to you?

42:20.038 --> 42:22.405
- You're not a killer, Jack.

42:22.407 --> 42:23.640
You tell your partner
there to watch his

42:23.642 --> 42:26.009
trigger finger or
he's going to lose it.

42:26.011 --> 42:28.378
Understood?

42:32.417 --> 42:34.551
- Who you giving up, Neeron?

42:34.553 --> 42:35.885
For these jobs.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.221
Moving up in the world, huh?

42:40.559 --> 42:42.592
- (speaking foreign language)

42:42.594 --> 42:44.227
And that's all you need to know.

42:44.229 --> 42:47.230
- No I need to know when
we're going to be square.

42:47.232 --> 42:49.265
- Square?

42:51.503 --> 42:53.570
Square has nothing
to do with it, Jack.

42:53.572 --> 42:55.905
You'll know when I'm
through with you.

42:58.510 --> 43:00.143
Later, buddy.

43:14.125 --> 43:17.694
- The way I look at it,
it's like this fish.

43:17.696 --> 43:20.563
People saying well I
shouldn't eat the fish

43:20.565 --> 43:25.635
because the fish is you know,
an important sentient being

43:25.870 --> 43:27.303
and that's true.

43:27.305 --> 43:28.204
- Excuse me, sir.

43:28.206 --> 43:29.939
I have some news.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.442
- Is it important?

43:32.444 --> 43:34.644
- Please, sir.

43:40.218 --> 43:41.551
- Excuse me.

43:49.628 --> 43:50.727
- I found them already.

43:50.729 --> 43:52.128
I'll take care of it right now.

43:52.130 --> 43:52.996
- Then take care of it.

43:52.998 --> 43:54.263
- I will, sir.

43:54.265 --> 43:55.765
- But you know I'm
just thinking that

43:55.767 --> 43:57.967
I'm not really
feeling confident.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.782
- So what's this surprise
you've been telling me about?

44:12.784 --> 44:14.651
- What do you think?

44:14.653 --> 44:16.653
- This is yours?

44:16.655 --> 44:18.655
- Fucking A it is.

44:18.657 --> 44:20.256
- God damn it, Sam.

44:20.258 --> 44:21.758
You are taking this back, man.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.959
- No way.

44:22.961 --> 44:24.160
- You don't even have a job.

44:24.162 --> 44:25.628
How are you going
to explain this?

44:25.630 --> 44:26.929
- You're spending all
of your money on Avalon.

44:26.931 --> 44:28.131
No offense, Avalon.

44:28.133 --> 44:28.865
- That is not the
same thing, man.

44:28.867 --> 44:30.166
- Fucking sure it is.

44:30.168 --> 44:31.834
I can spend my money
on what I like.

44:31.836 --> 44:33.536
Now piss off.

44:47.719 --> 44:49.852
- Fuck.

44:52.724 --> 44:54.023
- You were kind of
rough on him, Jack.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.558
- Just stay out of it, Avalon.

44:55.560 --> 44:57.060
- Fuck you, Jack.

44:57.062 --> 44:58.695
Take me home now.

44:58.697 --> 44:59.996
- Baby, I'm sorry.

44:59.998 --> 45:01.864
- Now.

45:06.171 --> 45:07.537
- [Avalon] Jack and
Sam fought sometimes

45:07.539 --> 45:09.238
like a married couple.

45:09.240 --> 45:12.341
The stress was affecting
us all in different ways.

45:12.343 --> 45:15.545
Or maybe it was guilt.

45:15.547 --> 45:17.547
Clearly we were taking shortcuts

45:17.549 --> 45:19.982
to try and make our
dreams come true.

45:19.984 --> 45:22.585
And everything was
getting too real.

45:22.587 --> 45:25.154
The fairy tale started
to crack apart.

45:37.602 --> 45:39.669
- You ready?

45:39.671 --> 45:41.604
- Whatever.

45:46.878 --> 45:47.944
- (speaking in a
foreign language)

45:47.946 --> 45:48.878
Everybody down.

45:48.880 --> 45:50.213
This is a robbery, you down.

45:50.215 --> 45:52.582
- You're making a big mistake.

45:52.584 --> 45:55.618
This is the Cerrancurie's money.

45:56.921 --> 45:58.521
- You, big guy, get down.

45:58.523 --> 45:59.956
Down on the ground.

46:06.965 --> 46:09.866
Last chance.

46:09.868 --> 46:11.768
- You're both dead men.

46:11.770 --> 46:13.269
- He said get down.

46:13.271 --> 46:15.638
- All right, manager,
you, keys, keys.

46:15.640 --> 46:17.774
Let's go, let's go.

46:17.776 --> 46:19.108
- (speaking foreign language)

46:19.110 --> 46:21.644
You and your men
still near point bed?

46:21.646 --> 46:23.479
Yeah.

46:23.481 --> 46:24.480
Yeah, the (speaking
a foreign language)

46:24.482 --> 46:25.248
are making a move right now.

46:25.250 --> 46:27.150
Go do what I would do.

46:31.656 --> 46:33.956
(police sirens)

46:36.327 --> 46:38.661
(gun fire)

46:38.963 --> 46:40.663
(police sirens)

46:40.665 --> 46:42.899
(gun fire)

46:53.178 --> 46:54.977
- Sam, I got to go to the bikes.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.612
Cover me.

46:56.614 --> 46:58.848
(tires screeching)

46:58.850 --> 47:02.652
(gun fire)

47:02.654 --> 47:03.786
Who the fuck are these guys?

47:03.788 --> 47:05.488
- How the hell should I know?

47:05.490 --> 47:06.355
- Come on, man.

47:06.357 --> 47:08.758
(gun fire)

47:12.630 --> 47:16.599
(gun fire)

47:34.285 --> 47:37.520
Sam, we have got to
get to the bikes, man.

47:38.990 --> 47:41.524
Move, move, move.

47:41.526 --> 47:42.625
Go.

47:42.627 --> 47:47.129
(gun fire)

48:21.532 --> 48:23.132
(tires screeching)

48:25.503 --> 48:28.271
(police siren)

49:30.401 --> 49:32.635
(gun shots)

49:44.949 --> 49:47.416
- Over half a million dollars.

49:47.418 --> 49:51.320
Somebody just came
into my banks and

49:51.322 --> 49:54.123
took that fucking money.

49:54.125 --> 49:57.626
They took the money
because someone

49:57.628 --> 50:00.730
told them it was there.

50:02.266 --> 50:05.368
Waiting for them.

50:06.838 --> 50:09.839
These two (speaking a foreign
language) are dead men.

50:09.841 --> 50:12.541
We can find them and
we can kill them.

50:12.543 --> 50:16.145
But what's more
important is to find out

50:16.147 --> 50:19.382
who the fucking rat is.

50:19.384 --> 50:21.817
On the inside.

50:21.819 --> 50:24.487
Because I think we know
this is an inside job.

50:24.489 --> 50:26.889
Don't we?

50:27.558 --> 50:29.492
- Looking at the banks, I'd
say these guys are coming

50:29.494 --> 50:31.327
from Thailand.

50:31.329 --> 50:33.529
They cross the border,
they do the job,

50:33.531 --> 50:36.565
and they go back.

50:38.302 --> 50:40.403
- Well, I'll get the money back

50:40.405 --> 50:44.507
but at this point, I'm not
as concerned about the money

50:44.509 --> 50:47.610
as my feelings.

50:52.350 --> 50:55.584
I would really hate
to kill you, you know.

50:55.586 --> 50:58.154
It would break my
heart to kill you.

50:59.657 --> 51:01.857
- If you think I turned on you,

51:01.859 --> 51:03.526
you do what you've got to.

51:03.528 --> 51:06.896
I have nothing to be scared of.

51:08.566 --> 51:10.399
- Unfortunately...

51:15.840 --> 51:18.607
I'm going to have to
wait to do what I do.

51:18.609 --> 51:20.543
Just a little bit longer.

51:20.545 --> 51:22.711
Because I want to
be sure I don't

51:22.713 --> 51:25.381
kill anybody innocent.

51:25.383 --> 51:27.716
A quarter of a million
dollars to any one

51:27.718 --> 51:31.787
of my brothers who
finds me this rat.

51:35.526 --> 51:39.261
I want his head put
in this fucking tray.

51:39.263 --> 51:41.464
By tomorrow.

51:46.037 --> 51:47.570
- I don't know what happened.

51:47.572 --> 51:50.272
These jobs are suppose to
always be easy pickings.

51:50.274 --> 51:52.441
- Maybe your secret connection
ain't that connected

51:52.443 --> 51:53.609
after all.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.244
What'd you think of
that crazy bastard man?

51:55.246 --> 51:57.279
This hairy Carry's
brother's money.

51:57.281 --> 51:58.881
- These guys are bad news, man.

51:58.883 --> 52:00.082
They're drug lords.

52:00.084 --> 52:01.417
I heard about them on the news.

52:01.419 --> 52:02.284
It's probably their
guys who shot the shit

52:02.286 --> 52:03.919
out of us.

52:03.921 --> 52:06.489
- And that crazy monkey
running son of a bitch.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.958
This guy you're meeting
after every job.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.726
Bro, you need to
tell me who he is.

52:10.728 --> 52:12.728
- I really don't know, Sam.

52:12.730 --> 52:13.562
He might be from a rival gang,

52:13.564 --> 52:14.630
he might be an inside guy.

52:14.632 --> 52:16.398
I just don't know.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.567
- Look, this shit's running deep

52:18.569 --> 52:22.071
and I need to know who's
out to kill my ass.

52:22.073 --> 52:24.340
- What do you suggest man?

52:24.342 --> 52:26.609
I'm lost here.

52:26.611 --> 52:28.911
- Let me have a think about it.

52:32.416 --> 52:34.316
- Hey, Sam.

52:34.318 --> 52:36.452
That was good shooting.

52:36.454 --> 52:38.220
- Cheers.

53:05.783 --> 53:08.684
(phone ringing)

53:08.686 --> 53:11.287
- Yeah, Neeron.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.155
What do you got for me?

53:13.157 --> 53:14.957
- Another bank score.

53:14.959 --> 53:16.859
Biggest one yet.

53:16.861 --> 53:18.694
Next week.

53:18.696 --> 53:20.629
A bank in Siem Reap.

53:20.631 --> 53:22.398
- That's good news.

53:22.400 --> 53:24.567
Because it's the last one.

53:24.569 --> 53:26.535
- I'll tell you when
it's the last score.

53:26.537 --> 53:27.870
- Hey fuck face.

53:27.872 --> 53:30.906
The commute is not
working for me anymore.

53:30.908 --> 53:32.241
All right, and if
you don't like it

53:32.243 --> 53:34.176
maybe I'll tell the
Cerrancurie brothers

53:34.178 --> 53:37.713
that you're the one that's
been feeding me these jobs.

53:42.553 --> 53:45.754
Did that get your
attention, asshole?

53:45.756 --> 53:48.424
- And how are you
going to do that, Jack?

53:48.426 --> 53:50.726
You're just going to
waltz into their compound,

53:50.728 --> 53:51.894
introduce yourself?

53:51.896 --> 53:53.495
What, I'm the
American that's been

53:53.497 --> 53:55.664
jacking your banks?

53:55.666 --> 53:58.534
You have no fucking
idea who these men are.

53:58.536 --> 54:00.336
- That may be the case.

54:00.338 --> 54:02.671
But you really should
listen to this.

54:02.673 --> 54:04.940
Yeah, Neeron, what
do you got for me?

54:04.942 --> 54:06.609
- [Neeron] Another bank score.

54:06.611 --> 54:08.010
Biggest one yet.

54:08.012 --> 54:09.411
Next week.

54:09.413 --> 54:10.746
A bank in Siem Reap.

54:10.748 --> 54:13.616
- Think they'll recognize
that voice, Neeron?

54:13.618 --> 54:14.750
How long you think
you're going to be alive

54:14.752 --> 54:16.785
after they hear that?

54:22.727 --> 54:24.793
- Ok, cowboy.

54:27.765 --> 54:29.298
We'll play your way.

54:29.300 --> 54:30.866
One last score.

54:30.868 --> 54:33.202
You give me my cut,
you make some money,

54:33.204 --> 54:36.705
then we'll go happily ever
after into the sunset.

54:36.707 --> 54:40.876
And then we'll be,
what did you say?

54:40.878 --> 54:42.911
Square.

54:42.913 --> 54:44.913
- Square?

54:44.915 --> 54:47.583
Yeah, fuck you square.

54:47.585 --> 54:49.418
I'm not going to spend
the rest of my life

54:49.420 --> 54:51.587
looking over my
shoulder, Neeron.

54:51.589 --> 54:55.324
And I am not every going
to let you hurt Avalon.

54:57.561 --> 54:59.328
- Until next time.

55:10.574 --> 55:13.275
- Sam, there's something I
want to talk to you about, man.

55:13.277 --> 55:15.177
After tomorrow's job,
Avalon and I are going to

55:15.179 --> 55:16.445
skip town.

55:16.447 --> 55:17.846
- Where are you going to go?

55:17.848 --> 55:19.615
- Don't know yet.

55:19.617 --> 55:22.251
- Don't know or don't trust me?

55:22.253 --> 55:24.820
- Don't know.

55:29.794 --> 55:32.328
What're we doing?

55:33.998 --> 55:36.265
- Do me a favor, get
me another drink.

55:36.267 --> 55:37.700
I'll be back in ten minutes.

55:37.702 --> 55:40.636
- That yabba shit is going
to kill you one day, man.

55:40.638 --> 55:42.538
- You've got your
vices, I've got mine.

55:42.540 --> 55:44.473
- Oh, yeah, what's mine?

55:44.475 --> 55:46.008
- Avalon's snatch.

55:46.010 --> 55:48.110
- Get the fuck out of here, man.

55:50.614 --> 55:53.048
Hey man (speaking a
foreign language).

55:53.050 --> 55:54.683
Cigarettes, do you
sell cigarettes?

55:54.685 --> 55:56.552
Ok, cool.

56:05.529 --> 56:07.129
Whiskey?

56:07.131 --> 56:08.697
And water.

56:08.699 --> 56:10.699
(speaking a foreign language)

56:10.701 --> 56:13.168
- Sick ride you got, Sammy.

56:13.170 --> 56:14.903
- [Sam] I want to
get wasted, you know?

56:14.905 --> 56:17.606
- Ok, cool, thanks man.

56:18.476 --> 56:20.743
- Get the fuck out of
the car, mother fucker.

56:22.546 --> 56:23.746
Put your hands down.

56:23.748 --> 56:25.781
(gun shot)

56:29.153 --> 56:32.621
(yelling)

56:43.267 --> 56:45.567
(gun shot)

56:49.673 --> 56:51.740
- Hey, hey you.

56:53.744 --> 56:54.543
Sam?

56:54.545 --> 56:55.344
Sam?

56:55.346 --> 56:56.779
Sam, god damn it, Sam.

56:56.781 --> 56:58.180
Oh fuck, man.

56:58.182 --> 57:00.749
Hey, buddy.

57:00.751 --> 57:03.919
- I don't think I'm going
to make the next job.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.387
- Don't worry about that, man,

57:05.389 --> 57:06.755
ok, we're going to
get you some help.

57:06.757 --> 57:08.557
We're going to get you
the fuck out of here, ok?

57:08.559 --> 57:10.626
- You were right.

57:10.628 --> 57:13.896
You said this shit
would kill me.

57:13.898 --> 57:15.130
- Sam?

57:15.132 --> 57:16.532
Sam, no, no, no, no don't.

57:16.534 --> 57:18.567
No, don't, man.

57:18.569 --> 57:21.603
Sam, don't fucking do this, man.

57:21.605 --> 57:23.272
Fuck.

57:23.274 --> 57:24.773
Sam?

57:24.775 --> 57:26.642
Sam?

57:26.644 --> 57:27.209
Sam?

57:27.211 --> 57:28.710
Fuck.

57:28.712 --> 57:31.146
Fuck.

57:31.148 --> 57:32.881
God damn it.

57:32.883 --> 57:36.084
(crying)

57:36.086 --> 57:38.454
Sam, mother fucker.

57:38.456 --> 57:41.890
(crying)

57:43.661 --> 57:46.061
Oh fuck.

58:21.799 --> 58:23.932
Oh, Sam.

58:26.704 --> 58:28.136
Yeah.

58:28.138 --> 58:30.772
Yeah, I'll bet
you're real torn up.

58:32.643 --> 58:35.043
Yeah, yeah.

58:35.045 --> 58:36.945
Yeah, I got it.

58:38.215 --> 58:40.382
Fuck that was fast.

58:40.384 --> 58:42.351
- What?

58:42.353 --> 58:44.319
- That was my connection.

58:44.321 --> 58:46.688
The guy heard about Sam.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.790
Says I still got to go
through with this next job

58:48.792 --> 58:50.792
or all bets are off.

58:50.794 --> 58:52.961
- Well, what does that mean?

58:52.963 --> 58:55.731
- It's not good.

58:57.635 --> 59:00.335
- Well, you can't pull
it off alone, right?

59:00.337 --> 59:01.703
- No.

59:01.705 --> 59:04.006
No way.

59:04.008 --> 59:06.575
I got to find a new partner.

59:06.577 --> 59:08.210
Somebody I can trust.

59:09.313 --> 59:10.913
- Well...

59:10.915 --> 59:13.015
You're looking at her.

59:13.017 --> 59:15.884
- Honey, I wasn't
saying that for you.

59:15.886 --> 59:18.587
- Who better to
watch your back, huh?

59:18.589 --> 59:20.656
Sam was your first
choice, I get it.

59:20.658 --> 59:22.057
He was your best friend.

59:22.059 --> 59:23.559
But now that he got
himself killed...

59:23.561 --> 59:25.661
- No, Avalon, there's
no fucking way.

59:25.663 --> 59:27.763
- Come on, I'm perfect.

59:27.765 --> 59:30.165
I've listened to every
detail of your other jobs.

59:30.167 --> 59:31.667
I know what to do.

59:31.669 --> 59:32.935
- Yeah, I know you're perfect.

59:32.937 --> 59:34.336
But there's a bit fucking
difference between

59:34.338 --> 59:35.737
hearing about a bank
robbery and actually

59:35.739 --> 59:36.872
robbing a bank.

59:36.874 --> 59:38.874
- Yeah, so how did you start?

59:38.876 --> 59:39.942
- That's not important.

59:39.944 --> 59:41.176
- Why, Jack?

59:41.178 --> 59:42.110
Why won't you let
me do this with you?

59:42.112 --> 59:43.278
- I don't have to tell you why.

59:43.280 --> 59:44.746
- Yes, you do.

59:44.748 --> 59:47.783
- Because I don't
want you to get hurt.

59:50.421 --> 59:52.654
Now that's it, end of story.

59:54.725 --> 59:56.959
- Check this.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:05.634
I can handle this gun
with my eyes closed, Jack.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:09.805
When I was growing up,
my father taught me how

01:00:09.807 --> 01:00:12.741
to shoot the snot off
any predator on earth.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:13.775
- That may be so,
but it's different.

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:18.313
- And with a body like this,

01:00:20.551 --> 01:00:24.019
you better believe I know
how to protect myself.

01:00:25.923 --> 01:00:28.724
- What if you've got
to shoot somebody?

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.759
Because on this job
we might have to.

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.894
You ready for that, Avalon?

01:00:32.896 --> 01:00:34.396
You ready to kill somebody?

01:00:34.398 --> 01:00:35.464
Without hesitation?

01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:37.065
Look him right in the eye?

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:39.067
Because that's going to happen.

01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:41.637
- I'll do what it takes
to protect you out there.

01:00:41.639 --> 01:00:45.140
Just like how you've
been protecting me

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.309
since the first day we met.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:52.347
I don't want to
kill anyone, Jack.

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:57.419
But if it means you'd
be safe I'd do it.

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.160
- This is crazy.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:07.596
You're crazy.

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:09.931
- So...

01:01:11.869 --> 01:01:13.702
- Ok.

01:01:13.704 --> 01:01:16.071
Let's go through it.

01:01:17.875 --> 01:01:20.776
Yeah, let's do it, here we go.

01:01:30.054 --> 01:01:33.355
- [Avalon] Didn't think I'd
find a car this fast, did you?

01:01:33.357 --> 01:01:36.191
- You got all the moves, baby.

01:01:38.729 --> 01:01:40.362
(laughing)

01:01:40.364 --> 01:01:42.564
Now let's go over it again.

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:45.701
- Ok, but I know what to do.

01:02:01.852 --> 01:02:05.821
(groaning)

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:11.827
- Hey, Lucky, how are you?

01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:13.829
- Mr. Cerrancurie.

01:02:15.099 --> 01:02:17.399
- Looks like your man
doesn't play by the rules.

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:20.335
- It's just a little practice
before the fight tonight.

01:02:20.337 --> 01:02:22.604
- You got any big
money on the fight?

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:23.839
- That's right.

01:02:23.841 --> 01:02:26.575
You know it takes big
money to make big money.

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:27.776
- Where you got
that kind of money?

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:30.278
I can afford that, how
you can afford that?

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.582
- You insinuating I had
something to do with that shit?

01:02:33.584 --> 01:02:34.583
- I'm just asking you a question

01:02:34.585 --> 01:02:35.784
to see what you had to say.

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:37.552
- I can't stand up to you.

01:02:37.554 --> 01:02:39.755
You want to think that of me?

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:42.190
I'm loyal till death.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:45.460
You've got no right to
accuse me of anything.

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:48.864
- We heard about the bank.

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.298
You just let those two
(speaking a foreign language)

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.600
get away with our money.

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:53.301
- Hey, they almost split
my fucking head open.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:56.138
I spent the night
in the hospital.

01:02:58.709 --> 01:03:00.475
- He's all right, man.

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:01.743
- Look, ever since
you guys took over,

01:03:01.745 --> 01:03:04.246
I play by your rules.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.781
Giving you your share
of the gambling.

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.649
I got nothing to hide.

01:03:07.651 --> 01:03:09.518
- Let him go.

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:34.676
- Big money on the
fight tonight, huh?

01:03:34.678 --> 01:03:36.378
Good luck with that.

01:03:58.969 --> 01:04:01.636
- Babe, what are you doing?

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:03.138
- What?

01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.673
It's not like I'm ever
going to get a chance

01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:05.874
to do this again, ok?

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:07.175
I've got to look good.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:09.544
- Babe, do you
remember, we wear these?

01:04:09.546 --> 01:04:11.379
A little extra protection.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:13.949
It covers our face.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:15.617
- Fine.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.788
Well, just in case, I want to
look good for the mug shot.

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:26.895
- You're ridiculous.

01:04:39.476 --> 01:04:40.475
(speaking a foreign language)

01:04:40.477 --> 01:04:41.309
Everybody down.

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.577
This is a robbery.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:45.914
(gun shot)

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.217
You, you, you, (speaking
a foreign language),

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:50.252
open the fucking door.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:52.254
Hey get out, get the fuck out.

01:04:52.256 --> 01:04:53.688
You over there, there, there.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.224
Told you open that fucking door.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:05:00.095
(suspenseful music)

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:32.127
(police siren)

01:05:33.297 --> 01:05:34.562
Avalon, go.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:36.798
(gun fire)

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.576
- Jack, start the car.

01:05:48.578 --> 01:05:50.879
(gun shots)

01:05:57.988 --> 01:06:00.455
(groaning)

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:05.160
(tires screeching)

01:06:12.903 --> 01:06:15.603
- You know, I must be
a dumb mother fucker

01:06:15.605 --> 01:06:17.072
or something because
I keep putting my

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.774
money in these banks.

01:06:19.776 --> 01:06:21.743
And the only reason
why I did that is

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:23.912
because one of my
most trusted employees

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:27.349
told me that was the
safe place to put my

01:06:27.351 --> 01:06:30.819
mother fucking money.

01:06:30.821 --> 01:06:34.956
You know, I'm having
trouble believing this shit.

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:36.925
Two (speaking a foreign
language) got away

01:06:36.927 --> 01:06:39.861
with 500,000
dollars US currency.

01:06:39.863 --> 01:06:41.863
Neeron.

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:44.699
You think I'm stupid?

01:06:44.701 --> 01:06:46.701
- No, Mr. Cerrancurie.

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:48.837
You're the master
mind and I wouldn't

01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:51.840
have gotten this far without
your leadership, sir.

01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:53.641
- To add insult to injury,

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:55.944
they're telling
me that one of the

01:06:55.946 --> 01:06:58.546
(speaking a foreign
language) is a girl.

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:00.382
I don't whether to
fucking kill them

01:07:00.384 --> 01:07:02.617
or hire them.

01:07:02.619 --> 01:07:04.886
- What do you think, Neeron?

01:07:04.888 --> 01:07:07.789
- I don't think anything of it.

01:07:07.791 --> 01:07:09.657
I'm not amused.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:11.459
Not at all.

01:07:11.461 --> 01:07:13.561
- I want these two (speaking
a foreign language) dead.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:15.730
And I want them dead today.

01:07:29.713 --> 01:07:31.146
- Can you take the wheel, baby?

01:07:31.148 --> 01:07:32.714
- Yeah, ok.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:33.681
- Ok, you got it?

01:07:33.683 --> 01:07:34.482
- Yep.

01:07:34.484 --> 01:07:36.951
(groaning)

01:07:38.088 --> 01:07:39.654
- Oh my god, Jack.

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:40.588
You've been shot.

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.757
- Ok, I've got it.

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:44.092
- We have to go to a hospital.

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:45.026
- Are you fucking crazy?

01:07:45.028 --> 01:07:45.827
- Jack.

01:07:45.829 --> 01:07:46.995
- Look at us.

01:07:46.997 --> 01:07:47.996
Do you want to spend
the rest of our lives

01:07:47.998 --> 01:07:50.165
in Cambodian prison?

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.001
- Ok, ok, fine.

01:07:53.003 --> 01:07:54.702
The next town we get to,
we're going to a pharmacy

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:55.737
and we're going to
get some supplies

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.005
to patch you up, ok?

01:07:57.007 --> 01:07:58.706
- Ok, that we can do.

01:07:58.708 --> 01:08:00.408
Fuck.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.077
(phone ringing)

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:03.611
Answer it.

01:08:05.382 --> 01:08:07.115
- Hello?

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:08.750
- Avalon.

01:08:08.752 --> 01:08:11.853
Is this you, my love?

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:13.221
- Who is this?

01:08:13.223 --> 01:08:14.756
- Where's Jack?

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.925
- I said who the fuck is this?

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.460
- [Neeron] It's Neeron.

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:21.129
You know, his connection.

01:08:21.131 --> 01:08:23.131
Now let me fucking talk to him.

01:08:23.133 --> 01:08:23.965
- Who's Neeron?

01:08:23.966 --> 01:08:25.966
- Give me the phone.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:27.969
Yeah?

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:29.370
Avalon.

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:31.106
She's quite spicy.

01:08:31.108 --> 01:08:32.774
- What do you want?

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:34.742
- [Neeron] I want my share of
the money, you cock sucker.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:36.444
What do you think?

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:37.578
Now in an hour meet me...

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:38.880
- No can do.

01:08:38.881 --> 01:08:39.881
Maybe a little while later.

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:41.448
Maybe tomorrow.

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.649
- If you try to run across
the border with my money

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.920
I swear to God,
there will be nothing

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:47.788
better for me to do
than hunt you down

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.892
and kill you and that
loud mouth bitch.

01:08:50.894 --> 01:08:52.393
- Hey calm down, mother fucker.

01:08:52.395 --> 01:08:53.161
I got shot.

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:53.928
I'm not going anywhere.

01:08:53.930 --> 01:08:55.563
I've got to patch up.

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:57.732
- [Neeron] Don't you die
before paying me, Jack.

01:08:57.734 --> 01:08:59.334
Or you know what
will happen to that

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:01.002
sweetheart of yours.

01:09:01.004 --> 01:09:02.604
- You know what, that's
enough of the threats, man.

01:09:02.606 --> 01:09:03.805
We've got some
settling up to do.

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:05.305
Just stay close to
your fucking phone.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:06.707
- Fuck you, Jack.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:23.992
- Honey.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:25.193
I got everything.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:26.027
- Did you get the sling.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:28.029
- Mhhmm.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:31.232
- Good girl.

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:35.435
(phone ringing)

01:09:41.778 --> 01:09:43.645
- Hello, sir.

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:46.481
No one's seen any sign of them.

01:09:46.483 --> 01:09:50.451
I'll wait here at the border
till it closes at midnight.

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:51.786
I'll call you if
anything happens.

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.453
- Ok.

01:09:57.060 --> 01:09:59.794
You're going to have to
go take care of this.

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:03.364
Be careful.

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:10.572
- He's at the border.

01:10:10.574 --> 01:10:13.007
Contact all of our
hotel connections.

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:14.943
Let me know when
you've got something.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:20.048
- [Jack] You ready?

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:21.249
- [Avalon] Yeah.

01:10:21.251 --> 01:10:22.317
- [Jack] Just like we
talked about, all right?

01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:23.718
- Ok.

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.820
(groaning)

01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.927
- Put some of that
vodka on the key.

01:10:34.264 --> 01:10:35.396
Yeah.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.265
Now pour some right
on that wound.

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:39.467
(groaning)

01:10:42.539 --> 01:10:43.404
Ok.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.172
- You ready?

01:10:44.174 --> 01:10:45.206
One.

01:10:45.208 --> 01:10:46.407
Two.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:47.108
Three.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:50.878
(groaning)

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.280
- Avalon, come on, do it.

01:10:52.282 --> 01:10:53.014
You can do it.

01:10:53.016 --> 01:10:54.282
You can do it.

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:55.383
Do it again.

01:10:55.385 --> 01:10:57.085
Come on.

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:59.921
- Ok, one.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:00.788
Two.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:03.291
(groaning)

01:11:03.293 --> 01:11:05.727
I can't do it.

01:11:05.729 --> 01:11:07.895
- Baby, you got to do it.

01:11:07.897 --> 01:11:09.697
You got to do it, Avalon.

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:11.132
Just stick it in there
and pull that bullet out.

01:11:11.134 --> 01:11:12.367
- Ok, ok.

01:11:12.369 --> 01:11:13.134
- One more time, come on.

01:11:13.136 --> 01:11:13.735
You can do it.

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:15.603
You can do it.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.038
- Ok.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:17.605
- Ok.

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:18.773
One.

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:19.607
Two.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:22.076
(groaning)

01:11:22.078 --> 01:11:24.812
- I'm sorry, I can't
do it, I can't do it.

01:11:26.449 --> 01:11:28.216
- That's ok.

01:11:28.218 --> 01:11:30.318
That's ok.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.954
- Baby, you have
to see a doctor.

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:35.790
- Ok.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.759
Yeah, ok.

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:40.461
We'll find a vet in Thailand.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:43.631
Somebody we can buy off.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:47.802
- Well it has to be soon,
you've lost so much blood.

01:11:50.307 --> 01:11:52.840
- It's not that much
blood, hey, hey.

01:11:52.842 --> 01:11:55.009
We're going to be ok.

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:56.744
I'm going to be ok, all right?

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.913
You're going to bandage me up

01:11:58.915 --> 01:12:01.916
and I'm going to be
just fine, all right?

01:12:01.918 --> 01:12:03.718
Ok.

01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:07.221
- Jack, Jack.

01:12:42.959 --> 01:12:45.693
(gun fire)

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:50.798
(gurgling)

01:12:54.337 --> 01:12:56.871
- Fucking amateur.

01:12:57.741 --> 01:12:59.674
- My brother was right.

01:12:59.676 --> 01:13:01.743
A rat's got no balls.

01:13:05.348 --> 01:13:10.284
(grunting)

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:31.239
(groaning)

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.911
I always knew it was
you, you fucking snake.

01:13:38.348 --> 01:13:41.682
(groaning)

01:13:52.595 --> 01:13:55.797
Look at me, Neeron.

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:57.965
I want you to see this coming.

01:14:03.807 --> 01:14:07.975
(groaning)

01:14:16.653 --> 01:14:19.654
- I bet you didn't
see that coming.

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.215
- Babe, wake up.

01:14:48.017 --> 01:14:49.250
Jack.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:52.753
Jack, wake up.

01:14:52.755 --> 01:14:54.789
Jack.

01:14:54.791 --> 01:14:56.757
Jack.

01:14:56.759 --> 01:15:00.761
(groaning)

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:05.166
Are you ok?

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:08.169
- I feel like shit.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:12.773
Babe, we've got to go.

01:15:12.775 --> 01:15:15.877
You drive, ok?

01:15:15.879 --> 01:15:18.846
I'll load the guns.

01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:22.316
- Why do you need
to load the guns?

01:15:22.318 --> 01:15:24.218
We're going home, right?

01:15:24.220 --> 01:15:27.221
- Yeah, we'll go home.

01:15:29.158 --> 01:15:31.959
I just got to take care
of my connection first.

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:36.464
Hey.

01:15:36.466 --> 01:15:38.366
Baby, it's ok.

01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:39.967
I promise.

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:25.212
(phone ringing)

01:16:25.214 --> 01:16:26.681
- Hello?

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.082
Jack?

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.717
- There's an old
temple off the highway,

01:16:29.719 --> 01:16:31.886
ten kilometers
west of Siem Reap.

01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:34.789
Be there at one o'clock.

01:16:34.791 --> 01:16:36.457
Not one minute before.

01:16:36.459 --> 01:16:37.925
Not one minute after.

01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:39.927
Do you understand?

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.796
- I'll be there.

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:59.880
- Son of a bitch.

01:17:03.453 --> 01:17:06.954
(phone ringing)

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:08.789
- Yeah?

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:10.091
- [Lucky] Mr. Cerrancurie.

01:17:10.093 --> 01:17:12.793
I just saw Neeron.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:15.162
- Don't let him
out of your sight.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:18.833
Tell me exactly where he goes.

01:17:18.835 --> 01:17:21.068
And don't fuck it up.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:22.870
- Yes, sir.

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:51.165
- What now?

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:53.734
- We wait.

01:18:25.501 --> 01:18:27.835
(phone ringing)

01:18:27.837 --> 01:18:29.837
- [Lucky] Mr. Cerrancurie.

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:30.738
- Where's he headed?

01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.839
- [Lucky] Siem Reap temple.

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:33.474
- I'll take it from here.

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:36.811
(speaking a foreign language)

01:18:52.662 --> 01:18:54.495
- Be right back.

01:18:54.497 --> 01:18:56.263
- Be careful.

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:09.410
- Hey Jack, you look like shit.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:16.951
I want my money.

01:19:21.691 --> 01:19:24.725
Give me that duffel bag or
I'll shoot that little bitch.

01:19:24.727 --> 01:19:26.660
(gun shots)

01:19:31.033 --> 01:19:32.666
(gun shot)

01:19:39.575 --> 01:19:40.775
- Are you ok?

01:19:40.777 --> 01:19:41.876
- I'm ok.

01:19:41.878 --> 01:19:44.779
He'll never hurt you, baby.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.283
- He'll never hurt us.

01:19:58.628 --> 01:20:00.928
Jack, we need to switch cars.

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:03.464
- Ok, let's go.

01:20:25.955 --> 01:20:27.655
- Jack?

01:20:27.657 --> 01:20:29.490
- What, doll?

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:32.226
Oh, shit.

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:36.997
- That's them in Neeron's car.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.833
Turn around.

01:20:38.835 --> 01:20:41.502
- Just keep driving, baby.

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:54.682
Faster.

01:21:00.323 --> 01:21:02.756
- We're after that BMW,
don't let them get away.

01:21:07.830 --> 01:21:09.730
- Shit.

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:13.534
Avalon, you give this
bitch all she's got, ok?

01:21:13.536 --> 01:21:15.135
Keep your eyes on the
road and don't look back.

01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:16.670
- Got it.

01:21:16.672 --> 01:21:18.439
(tires screeching)

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:24.645
- Faster, baby.

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.820
Just keep driving.

01:21:35.157 --> 01:21:39.059
(gun shots)

01:21:39.061 --> 01:21:40.895
Can't you go any faster?

01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:42.196
- This is it.

01:21:42.198 --> 01:21:44.899
(gun shots)

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:46.667
(screaming)

01:21:58.781 --> 01:22:03.851
(gun shots)

01:22:04.687 --> 01:22:08.856
(gun shots)

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:16.797
- Fuck you, assholes.

01:22:16.799 --> 01:22:20.334
(gun shots)

01:22:22.872 --> 01:22:24.805
- Oh my god.

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:27.708
(gun shots)

01:22:31.714 --> 01:22:34.949
(gun shots)

01:22:46.128 --> 01:22:47.761
What now?

01:22:47.763 --> 01:22:49.663
- I don't know.

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:50.764
Slow down.

01:22:50.766 --> 01:22:51.665
- What?

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:53.867
- Baby, slow down a little more.

01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:03.677
(gun shots)

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:08.816
(explosions)

01:23:08.818 --> 01:23:11.318
(tires screeching)

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.754
- God damn it.

01:23:15.091 --> 01:23:19.326
(laughing)

01:23:20.463 --> 01:23:21.795
- Did we lose them?

01:23:21.797 --> 01:23:23.163
- For now.

01:23:23.165 --> 01:23:25.632
We should put some
distance between us though.

01:23:25.634 --> 01:23:27.501
I think the border's
a few miles up.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.203
We'll figure it out there.

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:57.898
(groaning)

01:23:59.635 --> 01:24:01.735
Ok, baby.

01:24:01.737 --> 01:24:02.903
We're going to ditch the car.

01:24:02.905 --> 01:24:04.905
We can grab a boat
up the river here.

01:24:07.309 --> 01:24:09.843
- Who were those guys, Jack?

01:24:09.845 --> 01:24:12.513
- It's a long story, babe.

01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:14.915
- I thought you were
only hitting banks.

01:24:14.917 --> 01:24:16.850
- Me too.

01:24:16.852 --> 01:24:18.419
Turns out these
gangsters launder their

01:24:18.421 --> 01:24:20.487
money through the banks.

01:24:24.493 --> 01:24:27.161
Hey, it's ok.

01:24:27.163 --> 01:24:29.396
It looks like we're
home free now, huh?

01:24:41.377 --> 01:24:42.843
- Jack, they're here.

01:24:42.845 --> 01:24:44.478
- Fuck.

01:24:46.749 --> 01:24:48.415
Oh, fuck.

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:51.018
- Ok, so what's the plan?

01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:53.720
- Ok, the plan is you're
going to get out of here

01:24:53.722 --> 01:24:56.190
and I'm going to hold
them off as long as I can.

01:24:56.192 --> 01:24:56.757
- No.

01:24:56.759 --> 01:24:57.524
- Baby.

01:24:57.526 --> 01:24:58.692
- No.

01:24:58.694 --> 01:24:59.860
- Look, Avalon,
I've had a life, ok?

01:24:59.862 --> 01:25:01.095
And I spent the best
parts of it with you.

01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:02.696
Baby, back at the
safe there's almost

01:25:02.698 --> 01:25:03.864
a million dollars, ok?

01:25:03.866 --> 01:25:05.466
- Jack, it was never
about the money.

01:25:05.468 --> 01:25:07.701
Can we just give
it back to them?

01:25:07.703 --> 01:25:10.737
- It's past that, babe.

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:12.773
Ok?

01:25:12.775 --> 01:25:15.142
You got to get on a
boat and you're going to

01:25:15.144 --> 01:25:16.143
take that money
and you're going to

01:25:16.145 --> 01:25:17.544
get out of here.

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:18.745
You're going to
disappear and get a house

01:25:18.747 --> 01:25:19.913
on an island like
we talked about.

01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:20.981
- No, Jack, please
don't do this.

01:25:20.983 --> 01:25:21.882
- Ok, you're going
to buy a house.

01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:22.749
- Please don't do this.

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:23.584
Please don't do this to me.

01:25:23.586 --> 01:25:25.586
Please, Jack.

01:25:25.588 --> 01:25:27.121
- Baby, I love you.

01:25:27.123 --> 01:25:29.623
In this life and the next, ok?

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:31.258
Ok?

01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:32.626
- I love you too.

01:25:32.628 --> 01:25:34.561
- You've got to go.

01:25:34.563 --> 01:25:36.296
Baby, you got to go right now.

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.465
You got to go right
now, go, go, go, go.

01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:49.076
(gun shots)

01:25:55.584 --> 01:25:58.152
(grunting)

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:04.424
(gun shots)

01:26:19.008 --> 01:26:20.874
(screaming)

01:26:20.876 --> 01:26:23.710
(gun shots)

01:26:23.712 --> 01:26:24.711
- Fuck.

01:26:24.713 --> 01:26:27.781
(gun shots)

01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:52.206
Baby, go.

01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:57.477
- Jack.

01:26:57.479 --> 01:26:59.479
No.

01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:07.254
- Are you who killed Neeron?

01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:10.190
- Didn't I do you a favor?

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:12.426
- Yeah, I'm so
grateful for that.

01:27:12.428 --> 01:27:14.861
- Please don't hurt her.

01:27:14.863 --> 01:27:18.098
- You don't come into people's
yards, steal their money

01:27:18.100 --> 01:27:19.733
and shoot at them.

01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:22.569
There's people like
me who might get lucky

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.738
and kill you first.

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.773
- Just don't hurt her, man.

01:27:26.775 --> 01:27:27.541
- Jack.

01:27:27.543 --> 01:27:30.644
No.

01:27:33.215 --> 01:27:34.748
Jack, please don't leave me.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:35.616
Please.

01:27:35.618 --> 01:27:37.718
Please, don't leave me.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.753
- Hey, baby.

01:27:39.755 --> 01:27:41.722
- Jack.

01:27:41.724 --> 01:27:43.924
Jack?

01:27:43.926 --> 01:27:47.227
Jack?

01:27:47.229 --> 01:27:49.329
Jack?

01:27:52.901 --> 01:27:54.768
- You.

01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:58.872
Leave the money, take
your life and go.

01:28:00.075 --> 01:28:01.708
Now.

01:28:07.149 --> 01:28:09.716
- I love you.

01:28:19.995 --> 01:28:23.797
(slow bass music)

01:29:04.039 --> 01:29:05.806
I don't know why Gan
Cerrancurie spared my life

01:29:05.808 --> 01:29:07.908
that day.

01:29:08.944 --> 01:29:11.244
I guess even monsters
have a soft spot.

01:29:12.448 --> 01:29:15.716
Maybe I reminded him
of someone in his life.

01:29:15.718 --> 01:29:19.953
Compassion still lived
in him somewhere.

01:29:21.490 --> 01:29:24.291
I'm grateful I lived a
fairy tale with Jack.

01:29:24.293 --> 01:29:27.227
If only for a short time.

01:29:27.229 --> 01:29:30.464
But the price was too high,

01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:32.733
and I would give all
the money in the world

01:29:32.735 --> 01:29:34.935
to see Jack again.

01:29:36.739 --> 01:29:39.039
Now, Jack lives on.

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:41.808
But only in my heart.

01:30:00.062 --> 01:30:01.062
