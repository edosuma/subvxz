00:50.640 --> 00:52.920
911. Please identify yourself.

00:53.840 --> 00:55.880
There's a man in my house.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.880
I have a baby. He's going to kill us.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.280
Who's in the house, ma'am?
Ma'am, stay with me.

01:05.720 --> 01:06.680
Please, hurry!

01:12.400 --> 01:14.680
God, he's coming!

01:15.720 --> 01:16.680
He's coming.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.080
Possible homicide in progress.
Mother and infant.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.960
Dispatch all vehicles in the area.
Ma'am, stay with me.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.760
No! No!

01:40.120 --> 01:42.320
Why are you doing this?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.280
You're a bad mother.

01:58.080 --> 02:03.560
''Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop

02:04.840 --> 02:09.280
''When the wind blows, the cradle will rock

02:10.479 --> 02:15.240
''When the bough breaks
the cradle will fall

02:16.520 --> 02:21.800
''And down will come baby

02:21.960 --> 02:24.240
''Cradle and all''

02:25.600 --> 02:28.040
Let me finish your nightmare, kid.

02:36.880 --> 02:38.520
What's your status? ls SWAT here yet?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.040
Secure your perimeter.

02:49.240 --> 02:51.280
-What are you waiting for?
-SWAT team.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.600
They'll be all night. Take the stairs.

03:17.520 --> 03:19.440
We've got smoke in here.

03:22.440 --> 03:23.720
lt's him.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.240
Go!

03:43.560 --> 03:44.760
Don't shoot, please!

03:44.920 --> 03:46.720
-ls anybody else in there?
-No!

03:47.160 --> 03:49.000
Get them downstairs! Go!

03:49.120 --> 03:51.160
-Get them out!
-Check it!

03:54.000 --> 03:57.760
-We've got to wait for the fire trucks.
-Absolutely. Shit!

04:03.280 --> 04:05.560
Get those windows open. Go on!

04:05.960 --> 04:07.160
Come on! Move it!

04:44.840 --> 04:45.800
Come on, baby!

05:10.000 --> 05:10.960
Go!

05:14.960 --> 05:16.720
Come on, baby.

05:17.640 --> 05:19.120
l'm okay. Get out of here!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.120
What in hell are you doing?

05:52.440 --> 05:53.560
lt's okay.

06:11.080 --> 06:14.440
Take the baby. Get him to the hospital.
Make sure he's okay.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.440
Suspect is a white male,
heading north on Hauser on foot...

06:17.520 --> 06:19.560
...wearing a black leather coat.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.720
Hold it there!

06:45.040 --> 06:48.000
Stop the bus! Open up!

06:49.680 --> 06:51.520
-What's going on?
-Sorry, folks.

06:52.080 --> 06:55.760
Just a routine check.
Nothing to be alarmed about.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.720
What's going on?

07:03.760 --> 07:05.720
Sorry for the inconvenience.

07:12.000 --> 07:16.200
Everybody up! Against the window.
Don't look at me!

07:39.440 --> 07:40.400
Freeze!

08:29.880 --> 08:31.080
Be afraid, Jake.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.240
Be very afraid.

09:57.480 --> 09:59.280
Almost had him. l had him!

09:59.520 --> 10:01.480
Well, that's not your problem anymore.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.320
As of an hour ago, you're officially retired.

10:04.800 --> 10:06.000
l know.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.840
When they find the car
they should check for blood.

10:08.960 --> 10:11.480
Shut up, okay. lt's not your case anymore.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.680
l popped him one. Check for blood.

10:13.840 --> 10:16.040
You just couldn't leave quietly, huh?

10:16.640 --> 10:20.160
You know, l wanted
one last inspiring lecture from you.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.000
Ten years, you've heard them all.

10:22.080 --> 10:26.080
A lot of good it's done. But, before you go,
the feds are here. They want to talk.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.720
To me? Of course, they do.

10:31.480 --> 10:32.520
Gentlemen.

10:34.160 --> 10:37.760
-Stan Reisman. How are you?
-Fine. What do you want?

10:38.160 --> 10:41.360
-l understand you're leaving the force.
-That's right.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.080
-We'd like to offer you a job.
-No, thanks. Don't need one.

10:46.720 --> 10:50.160
We can help you catch him.
He will kill again.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.760
Last night,
the Torch claimed his 11th victim.

11:00.840 --> 11:03.360
This elusive serial killer
has remained at large...

11:03.440 --> 11:05.640
...for over three years,
preying on mothers...

11:05.760 --> 11:07.200
...throughout the Seattle area.

11:07.840 --> 11:11.680
Detective Jake Riley who has headed up
the case had this to say about the Torch.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.120
How's it to be leaving
with the Torch case unsolved?

11:14.200 --> 11:15.160
No comment.

11:15.280 --> 11:16.640
-Has he called you?
-No comment.

11:16.720 --> 11:19.080
Is this brilliant killer
the reason you're quitting?

11:19.160 --> 11:22.320
I'm retiring for personal reasons.
It's got nothing to do with it.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.120
-Come on. Give us something.
-I'll give you something.

11:25.200 --> 11:30.600
Our big bad bogeyman is nothing more
than a bed-wetting mama's boy.

11:30.680 --> 11:32.880
That's right.
He pisses himself all the time.

11:33.120 --> 11:37.360
Pathetic really. Just a sick pervert.
Is that enough for you?

11:37.880 --> 11:39.800
-Did you get that?
-Did we get that?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.400
Did you get that?

12:23.160 --> 12:26.120
-Darling, telephone for you.
-Oh, thanks, Mom.

12:26.720 --> 12:27.680
Yeah?

12:29.080 --> 12:32.160
That was a nasty thing
you said about me on TV.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.640
Oh, yeah? You're just a little too sensitive.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.080
I don't want you calling me anymore.
I'm retired.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.240
You can quit, but you'll never get rid of me.

12:40.800 --> 12:41.840
I'm too smart.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.000
Yeah, Mommy must be proud
of her little psycho.

12:44.400 --> 12:46.440
Stop it. Look at yourself.

12:47.120 --> 12:52.040
Three years trying to catch me.
But you failed. You're a bad cop.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.600
Do you think quitting would stop me?

12:55.120 --> 12:57.680
I'm going to keep on killing, asshole.

12:58.160 --> 13:01.440
-You're a real loser.
-Fuck you, you fucking prick!

13:01.560 --> 13:03.920
l'm gonna track you down
like a fucking dog!

13:04.000 --> 13:05.720
You understand, you son of a bitch?

13:05.800 --> 13:06.600
Fuck youI

13:06.680 --> 13:08.400
Fuck you, too, Jake.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.720
lt's always the same M.O.
with slight variations.

13:15.880 --> 13:18.840
Single mother. Mole.
Burns them postmortem.

13:19.880 --> 13:24.160
We've got partial prints.
Trace evidence. Blood type, even.

13:24.920 --> 13:27.360
-But still no Torch.
-No shit.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.400
Tell me something l don't know.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.600
We fed enormous amounts
of data on the Torch...

13:45.720 --> 13:49.400
...into our ViCAP supercomputer.
We've come up with a white male.

13:49.520 --> 13:51.440
Thirties. Very physical.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.960
Step up to the mark.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.440
Welcome, Jacob Riley.

14:44.240 --> 14:46.040
The Martucci slayings, a year ago.

14:46.320 --> 14:50.360
We found a hair follicle belonging to him.
lt was enough for a DNA imprint.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.200
Take a closer look.

15:04.000 --> 15:07.440
-Okay. So this is a clone of the killer?
-A replicant.

15:07.600 --> 15:10.360
God created man in six days.
We took longer.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.600
-Since when is the FBl--
-We're not FBl.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.280
We're National Security Force.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.840
We really don't care
about your serial killer.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.360
Originally, this was developed
for national security. Counter-terrorism.

15:28.400 --> 15:31.280
Today's intelligence
has failed to weed out terrorists.

15:31.520 --> 15:32.920
Okay. Go on.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.120
Our goal is to create replicants
that can lead us to them.

15:36.240 --> 15:37.520
l understand.

15:38.880 --> 15:40.520
He's not a terrorist, though.

15:40.600 --> 15:43.400
No. But the behaviour patterns are similar.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.600
So, why me?

15:47.360 --> 15:48.760
Because he picked you.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.880
What do you mean he picked me?

15:51.000 --> 15:54.000
When he's ready you'll take custody.
You'll care for him.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.760
Help him develop. Then you'll see
if he can lead you to the killer.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.600
Wouldn't it be easier
just to plaster his face on TV?

16:01.280 --> 16:06.720
This project is classified. No pictures.
No conventional techniques.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.920
All you have is Replicant.

16:29.560 --> 16:30.600
What's going on?

16:30.720 --> 16:34.320
A counter-reaction.
He's rejecting the latest growth hormone.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.240
-Talk to me. What can we do?
-V-fib! Flatline!

16:44.800 --> 16:47.080
Get him out. Now!

17:13.160 --> 17:15.040
Welcome to my world.

17:15.400 --> 17:16.520
Motherfucker.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.440
Good morning, Number One.

17:32.920 --> 17:34.400
Time to wake up.

17:37.160 --> 17:40.520
Today, we're going to cover the basics:
How to sit...

17:41.360 --> 17:44.160
...stand, walk and stop.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.760
Now I'm walking.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.680
I'm sitting.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.640
I'm standing.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.560
I'm Miss Johnson. How are you?

18:04.000 --> 18:05.480
Did you hurt yourself?

18:07.080 --> 18:08.920
Maybe your golden boy's retarded.

18:09.000 --> 18:12.440
Physical readings are normal,
but the brain sign waves are low.

18:14.400 --> 18:17.560
We've enhanced his telepathic ability
through genome resequencing.

18:18.920 --> 18:22.800
He may be our first, but genetic memory
has been scientifically proven.

18:23.040 --> 18:24.840
He just needs human stimuli.

18:26.400 --> 18:27.880
That's the toilet.

18:28.040 --> 18:31.560
That's where you come in:
first human contact.

19:18.520 --> 19:21.480
Good try. Watch the video and try again.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.040
-lmpressive, isn't he?
-He's exceeding expectations.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.160
You guys are pretty happy with yourselves,
aren't you?

19:46.400 --> 19:49.200
You have no idea
what you're getting into there.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.760
l've seen what he's able to do
firsthand to 1 1 women.

19:53.120 --> 19:58.040
lf this thing turns out to be anything
like the original, we're gonna regret it.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.000
At the end of the day,
Replicant is disposable.

20:08.640 --> 20:09.920
Take it easy.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.520
Food.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.440
Eat!

20:29.280 --> 20:30.400
l'm Jake.

20:46.040 --> 20:48.600
You like that? How about this?

20:52.040 --> 20:54.320
How's that?

20:57.800 --> 20:58.760
Here, here.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.640
Okay. Here. Look at that.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.560
You like that?

21:26.120 --> 21:30.040
Strong, huh? Easy! Take it easy!

21:34.360 --> 21:35.480
Take it easy!

21:38.320 --> 21:40.320
Back up! Back!

21:41.000 --> 21:43.200
Easy! Back!

21:48.440 --> 21:49.480
Now, sit!

21:51.760 --> 21:52.480
Sit!

21:58.080 --> 21:59.400
l'm standing.

22:01.600 --> 22:02.880
l'm walking.

22:04.920 --> 22:05.960
l'm sitting.

22:07.240 --> 22:08.200
Standing.

22:09.480 --> 22:10.440
I'm walking.

22:11.640 --> 22:13.120
I'm sitting.

22:13.640 --> 22:15.360
-I'm standing.
-StayI

22:24.240 --> 22:26.440
No. Walk.

22:31.280 --> 22:33.280
Move. Let's go.

22:44.720 --> 22:46.160
Give me your glasses.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.440
-Those are $500 sunglasses.
-Yeah?

22:54.240 --> 22:55.200
Look.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.080
Thank you.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.560
Do l get an owner's manual
on this guy, or what?

23:08.680 --> 23:11.800
You do whatever it takes
to awaken the killer inside.

23:11.880 --> 23:15.240
Here are your temporary NSF papers.
And your gun.

23:15.360 --> 23:17.880
-Got it.
-l want a report every 12 hours.

23:18.160 --> 23:21.680
Okay. Let's go. Walk!

23:33.280 --> 23:34.320
Sit.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.000
Sleeping killer. How sweet.

23:49.760 --> 23:51.600
We've got company.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.560
Okay, freak-of-science.

24:50.800 --> 24:54.000
Let's talk a little shop here, shall we?
What do you remember?

24:55.280 --> 24:57.960
What do you remember? Come on.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.840
Are you a killer? You feel like killing?

25:01.440 --> 25:04.720
Killing somebody other than a woman?
Show me how you did it.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.320
Show me how you did it, come on.

25:07.520 --> 25:10.280
Show me how you fucking did it.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.560
Remember that?

25:20.080 --> 25:21.040
Take it.

25:27.480 --> 25:28.600
Here.

25:30.160 --> 25:33.160
Want to kill me? Here's your chance.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.120
Do it.

25:37.800 --> 25:38.760
Do it.

25:39.960 --> 25:40.920
Do it.

25:43.720 --> 25:46.520
Drop the gun! Drop the gun!

25:47.240 --> 25:49.040
Three stooges to the rescue.

25:50.320 --> 25:53.920
Stay calm. Do not shoot the subject.
Jake, tell him to back off!

25:54.880 --> 25:56.280
Just shoot him. Kill him.

25:57.160 --> 26:00.840
-Goddamn it, Jake.
-Okay, boys. Take it easy.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.760
Maybe if you put your guns down,
he'll do the same.

26:15.840 --> 26:16.800
That's good.

26:19.880 --> 26:23.760
You deliberately jeopardised
a classified project. We're taking him back.

26:25.440 --> 26:26.920
Good riddance.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.240
He's useless.

27:48.560 --> 27:50.560
-Very nice.
-You broke my arm!

27:51.440 --> 27:54.000
You shouldn't have showed him
the moves!

27:56.240 --> 27:57.280
No!

27:59.720 --> 28:01.320
Hurts, don't it?

28:05.280 --> 28:07.280
-Freeze!
-No!

28:07.440 --> 28:09.880
Million-dollar project!
No shooting, remember?

28:10.240 --> 28:11.440
Put it away!

28:12.120 --> 28:13.960
That's it. Put it away!

28:15.440 --> 28:17.160
Stay! No!

28:18.400 --> 28:19.280
Stay!

28:19.960 --> 28:20.920
Here.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.440
Sit.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.240
Stay.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.000
Good.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.400
l'll call you a cab. Walk.

28:34.640 --> 28:35.600
Walk.

28:51.680 --> 28:52.640
Yeah, hi.

28:52.760 --> 28:55.280
l'd like an appointment
to see the house on Berkeley.

28:55.360 --> 28:58.560
-My name is Jake Riley.
-Drop the gun!

28:59.360 --> 29:00.080
Shut up!

29:00.160 --> 29:01.120
Excuse me?

29:01.200 --> 29:03.240
Sorry. lt was the radio.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.840
Half hour. Great. Thank you.

29:20.720 --> 29:21.760
You know this place?

29:23.120 --> 29:26.560
A year ago, you made it
the most famous house in the country.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.200
Real messy.

29:36.440 --> 29:38.440
Come on! Get back! Calm the fuck down.

29:38.560 --> 29:41.440
You hear me? Calm the fuck down.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.040
Okay. Let's go.

29:52.480 --> 29:54.320
lt's just rain. Come on.

29:57.600 --> 30:00.720
How about this weather? Jake Riley?

30:01.000 --> 30:02.480
Wendy Wyckham.

30:05.400 --> 30:06.680
Calm the fuck down.

30:06.960 --> 30:07.920
No.

30:09.120 --> 30:12.200
Sorry. My cousin Ron is a little special.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.800
-Let me show you in.
-Be good! Come on.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.440
This house was built in 1926.

30:20.600 --> 30:22.960
All the woodwork is original.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.960
A nice cosy fireplace here makes
the entrance that much more special.

30:28.040 --> 30:30.680
Over here, we have a spacious living room.

30:33.400 --> 30:34.760
This way.

30:35.920 --> 30:40.000
Here, we go into the kitchen
which has recently been remodelled.

30:40.240 --> 30:43.440
All the marble, of course,
imported from Florence.

30:43.880 --> 30:48.080
And over here, we have the dining room.
lt's perfect for entertaining.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.520
What line of work did you say you were in?

30:50.600 --> 30:52.120
l was in law enforcement.

30:53.080 --> 30:57.840
That's right. You're that TV cop.
The Torch case.

30:57.920 --> 30:58.960
l feel so much better.

30:59.080 --> 31:02.440
-You know the history of the house?
-Yes, l do.

31:02.720 --> 31:06.160
You know, it's such a shame
because most people can never get past it.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.600
But it is a steal.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.760
Way below market value.

31:11.640 --> 31:15.080
-ls he okay?
-Could you give us a minute, please?

31:16.280 --> 31:17.760
Absolutely.

31:20.360 --> 31:21.320
Let's go.

31:22.840 --> 31:23.800
Walk.

31:34.840 --> 31:35.800
Let's go.

31:58.720 --> 32:00.080
What do you remember?

32:13.960 --> 32:16.800
What? What is it? What do you see?

33:07.440 --> 33:11.200
-Has he been here before?
-ln another life.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.160
Let's go.

33:15.960 --> 33:19.400
l don't want to go home.
l want to go to the park! Now!

33:20.080 --> 33:23.360
Johnny, stop it! You're a bad boy.

33:46.320 --> 33:47.960
-How you doing, kiddo?
-Good.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.600
Come on! Jump up!

33:51.680 --> 33:53.000
Up you go!

33:54.880 --> 33:57.440
How you doing? You've been a good boy?

33:57.560 --> 33:59.120
Up you go!

34:01.800 --> 34:05.160
-How's things going?
-Good! Mommy's making your favourite.

34:05.280 --> 34:06.600
l like that.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.080
Go give Mommy a hug for me. Go!

34:18.920 --> 34:19.960
Be good.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.560
Danny, go on upstairs, okay?
And take Scout with you.

34:22.760 --> 34:24.440
-Okay?
-Scout, come!

34:28.920 --> 34:30.040
Come on.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.280
Sit. Down.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.880
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

34:50.920 --> 34:53.920
Classified. lf l told you l'd have to kill you.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.600
That's not funny.

34:56.840 --> 34:59.520
Sorry, l know. Listen, l need your help.

34:59.640 --> 35:03.000
l've got to get a rendering of this guy
as soon as possible.

35:03.880 --> 35:05.920
l'm not going to do that for you.

35:06.320 --> 35:09.160
That's against department policy.
Remember?

35:10.280 --> 35:12.720
That's why it's considered a favour.

35:36.240 --> 35:39.520
That's gross! Don't eat that!

35:39.920 --> 35:43.120
That's for doggies. Here. Try this.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.680
Want some more?

35:59.600 --> 36:02.040
You're supposed to say, ''Thank you.''

36:14.680 --> 36:15.880
What happened?

36:16.840 --> 36:18.040
Baby, what happened?

36:24.640 --> 36:26.080
Come here. Get up!

36:27.240 --> 36:29.680
You son of a bitch!
What did you do to him?

36:30.080 --> 36:31.640
Scout hit me in the tooth.

36:31.800 --> 36:35.400
lt was Scout? Wait a second.

36:36.560 --> 36:38.680
Stop! lt wasn't him.

36:38.800 --> 36:43.640
Scout knocked his tooth out.
lt was the dog. lt wasn't him.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.160
What happened?

37:23.520 --> 37:25.720
l kicked the shit out of him.
Honest mistake.

37:26.000 --> 37:29.080
lt's been 18 hours. You've gone AWOL,
let him attack my men...

37:29.160 --> 37:31.960
...and now you're telling me
you've mistreated my replicant?

37:32.040 --> 37:34.760
-Perhaps l made an error in judgment.
-Perhaps you did.

37:35.040 --> 37:39.520
Perhaps you should take your experiment
and go. l don't need your shit.

37:40.200 --> 37:44.520
After what the Torch said to you,
l thought you'd really want to nail him.

37:44.600 --> 37:46.400
How do you know what he said to me?

37:47.840 --> 37:50.200
You got my place wired, is that it?

37:51.720 --> 37:53.360
How did you know where we were today?

37:53.520 --> 37:55.200
You tracking us, too?

37:55.480 --> 37:58.840
You think we'd let you out
with the future of our national security...

37:58.920 --> 38:00.960
...without knowing everything about you?

38:01.080 --> 38:03.360
l expect a report every 12 hours.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.120
No exceptions.

38:19.560 --> 38:21.760
-ls that you?
-Yeah, it's me, Mom.

38:24.920 --> 38:26.440
Get your clothes off.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.280
That's it. Good. Stay!

38:36.560 --> 38:38.600
Not in the car. Too obvious.

38:38.760 --> 38:39.800
Let's see.

38:40.920 --> 38:43.280
lnternal, is that it? Open.

38:44.040 --> 38:47.920
lnternal tracking device.
They think they're real smart.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.240
lnternal. Smart, isn't it?

38:54.000 --> 38:58.040
lt's okay. Calm down.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.080
What are you doing?

39:09.160 --> 39:10.480
l'm working, Ma.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.800
lt's okay. lt's not what you think.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.480
Let's go, Ma.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.760
Jacob!

39:21.880 --> 39:23.760
-What?
-That man was beaten up.

39:23.840 --> 39:26.360
Ma, you don't even know the guy, okay.

39:27.040 --> 39:30.560
Wait a minute! l'm talking about you.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.640
What is the matter with you?
What has happened?

39:33.720 --> 39:36.760
-What's wrong with you?
-Why are you treating people like that?

39:36.840 --> 39:39.760
Mom, stop. Please.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.640
Okay. But remember one thing:

39:43.000 --> 39:47.520
lf you treat people like criminals,
that is exactly what they will become.

39:48.680 --> 39:51.560
Your dinner's in the fridge.
l'm going home.

40:12.520 --> 40:13.840
Thank you.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.240
I can't take itI

40:38.320 --> 40:41.120
You have ruined my life.

40:42.920 --> 40:45.600
Where are you?

40:46.720 --> 40:48.480
Bad boyI

40:50.880 --> 40:52.640
You must be punishedI

40:57.040 --> 40:58.440
You're a bad mother.

40:59.600 --> 41:01.080
Hey, you all right?

41:02.240 --> 41:03.960
Leave her alone!

41:35.240 --> 41:36.520
Easy, man.

41:43.040 --> 41:45.240
Thanks for the favour. l owe you one now.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.080
Forget about it.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.480
Right here. Stay.

41:52.400 --> 41:53.680
Subject loaded.

41:57.080 --> 41:59.120
Okay, let's see what you remember.

41:59.200 --> 42:01.000
How about this one?

42:01.080 --> 42:02.760
Remember that one?

42:03.520 --> 42:05.400
Come on, talk to me.

42:05.480 --> 42:08.640
The picture's scanned.
Make it snappy, all right?

42:46.200 --> 42:48.200
Sit down. Go on, sit.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.920
''Edward Garrotte.''

42:55.520 --> 42:59.120
Outstanding.
''lmmigrated from South Africa, 1995.''

43:09.920 --> 43:11.880
-Jake?
-Captain, how's the market?

43:11.960 --> 43:13.720
Well, oil prices are down.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.320
What the hell are you doing here?

43:15.400 --> 43:17.920
l was just cleaning up some files.
All done now.

43:18.000 --> 43:21.440
-Are you jerking me around?
-No, got to go.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.160
You're jerking me?

43:25.240 --> 43:26.200
Shut up.

43:35.200 --> 43:37.080
Son of a bitch.

43:54.680 --> 43:55.800
Stay.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.960
Let's go.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.800
Jesus Christ.

45:21.360 --> 45:22.760
Next victim.

45:23.640 --> 45:24.840
Keep it.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.320
Jake, we have an illegal entry.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.040
This is one sick puppy.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.280
The Torch. You got him.

45:53.360 --> 45:56.040
-That's him in the car.
-No. l'll explain later.

46:13.760 --> 46:16.200
Jake, l've got to call this one in.

46:41.600 --> 46:42.880
You...

46:42.960 --> 46:44.840
...back off!

46:50.720 --> 46:53.520
Get out! Go!

47:23.920 --> 47:25.520
Call for help.

47:27.160 --> 47:28.600
Are you okay?

47:29.240 --> 47:31.040
Where is he? He knew.

48:00.200 --> 48:03.560
Jake! What the hell's going on?

48:04.200 --> 48:06.760
-What's going on?
-Not now! l'm gonna lose him.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.840
That's the Torch.
You got the Torch in the car.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.840
No, it's not him. He's the key.

48:10.920 --> 48:13.440
-l got to find him.
-Jake, wait a minute!

49:08.160 --> 49:09.640
Who the fuck are you?

49:09.960 --> 49:11.600
Who the fuck are you?

49:29.720 --> 49:30.920
Break it up!

49:54.560 --> 49:55.600
Back off.

50:16.520 --> 50:17.800
No more phone calls.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.640
Who are you? What do you want?

50:32.600 --> 50:34.120
What do you want?

50:38.000 --> 50:39.400
You asshole!

51:23.000 --> 51:25.600
l lost him. How is he?

51:30.560 --> 51:31.680
How is he?

51:31.800 --> 51:33.160
You've been lying to me.

51:33.280 --> 51:36.200
Gunfire reported at Martini's Lounge,
9th and Renfrew.

51:36.280 --> 51:39.240
Caucasian male, black leatherjacket.
Any units in the area....

51:39.320 --> 51:40.920
That's two blocks away.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.880
There were two guys fighting
and they shot my boss.

51:49.960 --> 51:51.080
Then they took off.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.440
Calm down.

51:52.520 --> 51:54.160
Two guys. ldentical twins.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.680
-They were fighting.
-Stay here!

51:59.880 --> 52:02.720
The janitor said that it was
two identical twins fighting.

52:03.000 --> 52:04.360
ldentical twins.

52:09.000 --> 52:10.040
Go. Straight.

52:24.680 --> 52:25.400
Yeah?

52:25.520 --> 52:27.960
I'm proud of you. You're alive.

52:28.880 --> 52:30.320
Who is he?

52:30.480 --> 52:33.000
You're so smart, figure it out for yourself.

52:34.000 --> 52:35.360
l will.

52:36.400 --> 52:38.440
It will be my biggest challenge yet.

52:44.720 --> 52:46.600
Watch where you're going.

52:59.400 --> 53:01.360
Hey, buddy. Come on, beat it.

53:01.440 --> 53:04.320
Get out of here.
Yeah, you. Get out of here.

53:10.840 --> 53:12.680
Hello, Jake. How's my replicant?

53:12.760 --> 53:14.960
Fine. Shits and pisses in the toilet.

53:15.080 --> 53:16.120
Wants to get laid.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.680
Hasn't killed anybody yet, though.

53:18.840 --> 53:20.640
You know what I mean.

53:21.320 --> 53:22.640
Yeah, l do.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.280
And, yeah...

53:24.560 --> 53:27.240
...something's happening.
I think he's remembering stuff.

53:27.320 --> 53:30.520
Excellent. What can we do
to accelerate the process?

53:30.680 --> 53:31.400
Nothing.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.400
He's doing fine just on his own.

53:34.520 --> 53:36.880
But l've chosen a different approach.

53:37.280 --> 53:38.880
Yeah? What's that?

53:38.960 --> 53:40.240
You don't know?

53:40.680 --> 53:43.120
You don't know where we are right now?

53:44.240 --> 53:46.920
Aren't you still tracking us?

53:49.960 --> 53:51.640
4901 LaSalle.

53:51.720 --> 53:53.240
That's the red-light district.

53:54.320 --> 53:55.600
That's right.

54:03.200 --> 54:05.400
Hey, baby, what's the hurry?

54:09.440 --> 54:11.080
Like what you see?

54:16.320 --> 54:18.000
Let's take a walk.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.160
Come on.

54:25.240 --> 54:25.960
Come on.

54:37.800 --> 54:39.840
Make yourself comfortable.

55:18.760 --> 55:22.280
So, what's it gonna be?

55:28.480 --> 55:29.800
Have a seat.

55:30.920 --> 55:32.920
Let's just take this off.

55:33.520 --> 55:34.920
There we go.

55:42.160 --> 55:44.920
Okay, we can do that.

55:59.120 --> 56:02.720
Okay, that's all the freebies, baby.
Now l've got to see the green.

56:04.280 --> 56:06.720
Okay. Look, l said $100. Pay up.

56:07.360 --> 56:09.320
$100. Pay up.

56:10.400 --> 56:12.680
l said $100. Pay up!

56:13.280 --> 56:16.120
What are you doing?

56:17.440 --> 56:20.560
Let me go! Get the fuck off of me!

56:21.560 --> 56:24.400
Let me go! No!

56:33.400 --> 56:35.440
Yeah, l got me a deadbeat.

56:38.080 --> 56:40.360
What the hell is wrong with you?

56:43.520 --> 56:45.240
ls this your first time?

56:47.000 --> 56:48.200
Oh, shit.

56:48.920 --> 56:50.600
Look, l had no idea.

56:52.400 --> 56:55.000
Let's say it never happened, okay? Go!

56:55.080 --> 56:56.480
Come on. Go!

56:59.480 --> 57:00.680
Stop it.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.760
Stop it! Go!

57:04.160 --> 57:06.360
We got a problem with payment?

57:09.320 --> 57:10.920
l'm here to collect.

57:15.480 --> 57:17.520
Leave him be.
He doesn't know what he's doing.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.920
Shut up! You like this guy or what?

57:21.040 --> 57:23.760
You know the fucking rules, don't you?

58:15.200 --> 58:16.880
l've had enough.

58:18.320 --> 58:22.440
Stop it! Leave him alone! Please!

58:45.160 --> 58:46.800
Police! Don't move!

58:46.880 --> 58:49.160
-Get down! Freeze!
-Don't shoot!

58:49.440 --> 58:51.000
Get down, now! Get down!

58:51.400 --> 58:52.360
Get down!

58:52.480 --> 58:54.600
You men. Easy, boys.

58:54.720 --> 58:56.560
-Come on, man!
-What's going on, Jake?

58:56.640 --> 58:58.600
lt's okay. He's with me. l'll get him.

58:58.680 --> 59:02.040
Okay. Take it easy. Relax. Sit down.

59:05.120 --> 59:07.400
He's all right. You'll be okay.
Go with him.

59:13.440 --> 59:15.400
l brought you your coat.

59:17.440 --> 59:19.640
Look me up when you get out, okay?

59:36.160 --> 59:37.200
Come on.

59:37.280 --> 59:42.680
What is it you remember?
Help me out, buddy. Think.

59:45.560 --> 59:46.680
Remember.

59:46.800 --> 59:48.000
That's it.

59:48.120 --> 59:49.160
Bad boy.

59:49.560 --> 59:51.680
Bad boy? What do you mean ''bad boy''?

59:53.840 --> 59:54.960
Hello, Mama.

59:55.040 --> 59:58.160
Remember the mothers?
The killing of the mothers?

59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.000
Come on, talk to me.
What do you remember?

01:00:01.080 --> 01:00:02.200
Remember.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.280
Look at this picture.
Do you know this woman?

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.040
-Get the rendering?
-No DMV or passport.

01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:09.560
-She's got to be a tourist or something.
-Shit. ls she next?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:13.080
-Look at this picture.
-Is she next?

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.280
ls she next?

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:39.080
''Rock-a-bye baby, in the treetop
When the wind blows, the cradle will rock

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:43.400
''When the bough breaks
the cradle will fall''

01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.120
What do you see?

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:49.240
What do you see?

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:51.960

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:56.520
Me kill.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.400
Jake, who am l?

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:25.360
You are a genetic double.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.600
Genetic double.

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.000
l don't understand it either, buddy, but....

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.800
Your other half, he's a killer.

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.080
No.

01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.280
Hop in.

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:00.240
lt's all yours.

01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:05.600

Good.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.040

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:54.640
There you go.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:04.280
There you go.
You got to do me a favour here.

01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.680
l want you to look at that.

01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.680
You know that girl?

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:17.880
What are you thinking?

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.520
Here, no.

01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.160
Draw up here. That's good, up there.

01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:33.720
l don't know. House?

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.240
Church? What?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:37.160
Go ahead.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:44.720
l got it.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:03:59.800

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:22.600
Can you tell me if she's staying here?

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.040
Excuse me?

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.000
ls she a guest in the hotel?

01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:29.320
Who are you?
A police officer? You have lD?

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:31.400
lt doesn't matter who l am.
She's in danger.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:35.160
l'm very sorry, sir,
but hotel regulations strictly forbid....

01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.520
Excuse me.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:44.400
Sir, you're not permitted upstairs
unless accompanied by hotel staff.

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:46.160
Okay, l understand that.

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:51.360
l'm calling Security. Get out. Get out!

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.880
Stay!

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.800
Shit!

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.440
Open the door. Come on!

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.000
Make your call!

01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:30.000
We have a fire, 1404.
l repeat, we have a fire, 1404.

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.800
Here. Go!

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.520
ls he close?

01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:09.920
Close.

01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.760
What are you doing? Get back.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.640
Get over here and open the door!

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.320
Open the door, damn you!

01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:56.600
Open the fucking door! Open the door!

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.120
Get back here and open the door, now.

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.800
Get over here!

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.520
Stop and get over here right now!

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:10.480
Get back here, you asshole!

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.520
Damn it!

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.280
You received my message.

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:46.800
What are you?

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.640
Genetic double.

01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:52.560
A clone?

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.760
Un-fucking-believable. Fantastic.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.200
Beautiful.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.480
My exact replica.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.520
We are the same.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:11.440
Same?

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:15.360
Yeah. My body is your body.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.880
My mind is your mind.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:24.520
My life is your life.

01:08:25.479 --> 01:08:28.840
But, my brother, Jake cannot be trusted.

01:08:30.359 --> 01:08:32.279
He's going to kill you.

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:34.880
l'll protect you, my brother.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.160
Brother.

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.520
Where are you?

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:45.680
We are identical.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.359
-Get out of the way!
-ldentical.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:50.279
Get out of the way!

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.640
Get out of the way!

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.680
Move!

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:08.479
You let him get away!

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.279
We are the same.

01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.240
l should have shot you both.

01:09:12.319 --> 01:09:15.399
Goddamn you!
He's screwing with your mind!

01:09:16.279 --> 01:09:17.960
Will Jake kill me?

01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:22.600
Will Jake kill me? We are the same.

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:41.920
Will Jake kill me?

01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.040
-We are the same.
-Shut up!

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.160
-Jake, are you on the case?
-NoI

01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.040
-Are you back on the force?
-I'm retired.

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:52.880
Can you say something better than that?

01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.000
Look, this is an individual
who refuses to take responsibility.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.640
As far as I know,
he's not taking responsibility.

01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:01.560
He's a fucking nutcase, that's all.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:08.880
l've been waiting for your call.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:11.600
I know. How's your whiskey?

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.720
lt's fine.

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.160
How's my replicant?

01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.520
He's good.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.600
Put us on the speakerphone.

01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:24.720
Why would l want to do that?

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:28.400
We can talk, like family.
I want both of you to hear me.

01:10:29.640 --> 01:10:31.320
Go ahead and talk.

01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:34.480
I want him to know how much I love him.

01:10:34.560 --> 01:10:37.240
What it means to me
to have him in this world.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.600
How nice.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.680
Psycho love.

01:10:41.040 --> 01:10:43.800
So, do you want to know
who's my next victim?

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.760
Ask my brother.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:48.440
Jake.

01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.280
What are you waiting for?

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.040
In time, Jake.

01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:54.720
ln time.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:01.160
Give me a reason,
l'll blow your fucking head off.

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.080
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.800
-Hello, Mr. Savard.
-Hi, Carol.

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:30.000
-How's Mama today?
-Well, she's had better days.

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:33.160
-Maybe you can cheer her up.
-l've got a surprise for her.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:34.440
Good.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.760
And this one.

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:56.280
l cut her good. Very slow.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.880
l wish you were there.

01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:03.040
She was begging.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.560
Screaming.

01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:13.160
Bad boy, you must be punishedI Bad boyI

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.960
But you know what?

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:20.000
l did it for you.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:24.120
You bad boy!

01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:28.600
You must be punishedI

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:31.960
No.

01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:38.320
No more, you bitch.

01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:44.040
No more.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.560
You should never have been bornI

01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.240
Luc Savard.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.920
Luc Savard.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:28.520
Jake, I got it. Luc Savard.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.480
Jesus, talk about a bad boy.
Shoplifting at 11...

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:33.280
...grand-theft auto, narcotics, arson.

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.480
He enlisted in the corps in '88.

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.160
Reportedly killed
behind enemy lines in June of '91.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.280
But the body was never recovered.

01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:42.800
And I tracked down his mother.

01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:46.040
Gwendolyn Savard. She was committed
to the Nepenthe Home...

01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.160
...six years ago, after a stroke.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.640
One other thing:

01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.160
This woman killed her husband.

01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:55.320
She locked the kid up in a closet
and then set the house on fire.

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.720
Luc Savard only lived
because it rained that night.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:12.080
Mr. Savard?

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:18.160
We tried to call you last night.

01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:24.600
-He was here last night?
-Of course.

01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.920
l'm sorry, your mother....

01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.960
She had a sudden cardiac arrest.
We did everything we could.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.960
She was just too frail.

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.920
Her things.

01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.440
Excuse me.

01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.400
-May we see the body?
-Yes. Of course.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.320
Take it easy, Jake.

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.840
You want her to die? Do you?

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.240
Your gun, drop it.

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.360
Drop your gun.

01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:37.520
Good.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:39.960
You're not so smart.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.200
You never saw me coming.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.360
This is it, Jake.

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.400
You're going to die.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.200
So, what's the matter, Jake?

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.760
No smart comeback?

01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:27.080
No reporters to joke with?

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:39.440
He's not your family.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.960
He doesn't care about you.

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:46.040
But l do. That's why l want you with me.

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:49.600
l have an idea.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.400
You're gonna kill him.

01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:00.720
Do it.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.080
Finish him.

01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:06.920
Yeah.

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:19.480
No.

01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:32.720
That's why you're going to die with him.

01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.520
And they'll think you are me.

01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:39.360
You are a bad boy, Luc Savard.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.760
What did you say?

01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:50.040
You are a bad boy, Luc Savard.

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.880
You killed Mama.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:54.680

01:17:55.120 --> 01:17:58.800
That's right. And so what? lt felt good.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.800
You bitch!

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:55.640
Okay. You're gonna be okay.

01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.720
Don't move. l'll be back.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.520
There he is!

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.520
-Where is he?
-He's down there.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:14.840
Damn!

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:41.680
Not bad for a mama's boy?

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.880
Should l call the news now or later?

01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:56.840
Stop it.

01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.920
lf you kill me, you kill yourself.

01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:16.680
The safety, Luc Savard.

01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:55.440
What makes you think you can take me?

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:23.200
l can read your mind.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.520
Look at me. Come on, buddy.

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.840
-Look at me.
-Jake.

01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.880
My family's gone.

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:38.560
He's not your family.

01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.680
l'm your family. l'm your family now.

01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.120
Jake, l see rain...

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:51.720
...in my eyes.

01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:53.440
l see rain.

01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.640

01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:34.160
Open the door!

01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.960
Open the goddamn door!

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.560
Well, the only ones who made it
were the corpses in the fridge drawers.

01:30:05.720 --> 01:30:07.640
l expect a full report.

01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:20.360
Danny, you may be in first
but l'm better than you.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.400
No.

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.080
No, l'm in first. Who's the best?

01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.760
Me!

01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.760
-Did you see the delivery-man?
-No.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:00.600
Let's go get it.

01:31:26.280 --> 01:31:27.760
He likes rain.

01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.440
-Hi.
-Hi.

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.840
