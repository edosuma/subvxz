WEBVTT

00:10.550 --> 00:13.508
Jesus Christ. How am I supposed to...

00:13.590 --> 00:15.387
That's great. Go with it. Go with it.

00:15.470 --> 00:17.051
Watch out.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.556
Just go with it.
It looks great.

00:18.640 --> 00:21.382
- Watch where you're walking.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21.850 --> 00:23.477
It's the Deuce, man.

00:23.560 --> 00:25.516
Yo, mama. You fine.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.358
Yo, yo, what the fuck?

00:29.860 --> 00:31.521
No, no, no, it's okay,
he's in the movie.

00:31.610 --> 00:33.908
He's in the _movie _
we're making With the girl.

00:33.990 --> 00:37.448
- A movie?
- Yeah, look. We're making a ﬁlm.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.077
- On the Deuce.
- Yeah.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.322
Right out here on the street.

00:42.410 --> 00:46.995
Damn. Son, you gotta get that shit
checked out by a dentist.

00:49.670 --> 00:50.705
This is a goddamn joke.

00:51.420 --> 00:54.583
- Lance Minx doesn't work like this.
- No, no, no. Calm down.

00:54.680 --> 00:55.669
You in the movie, too?

00:55.760 --> 00:56.886
Mmm-hmm.

00:56.970 --> 01:00.098
I seen you in something.
Can't remember what, though.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.637
Wait; actual/)4 have you seen
Shampoo?

01:03.940 --> 01:05.396
What the fuck is that?

01:05.480 --> 01:07.971
- How about
Demon Seed?
- Shit.

01:08.610 --> 01:10.680
You the bitch got pregnant with
the computer's baby.

01:11.030 --> 01:14.102
This whole thing
is so goddamn unprofessional.

01:14.200 --> 01:16.486
I can't believe you people
operate this way.

01:16.570 --> 01:18.618
Hey. Hey, gentlemen,

01:18.700 --> 01:21.942
since you are such big fans
of Miss Christie here,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.156
would you do something for us?

01:26.370 --> 01:28.281
- Sorry, man.
- Y'all got to move out.

01:28.380 --> 01:32.749
Get out the way.
Walk on the other side.

01:32.840 --> 01:34.876
- Cross the street.
- Get out the way.

01:35.010 --> 01:36.580
A little help? Come on, man.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.046
Hey, I'm not playing with you.
Step off. Now.

01:40.010 --> 01:41.170
Yeah. Keep walking.

01:41.260 --> 01:44.263
Okay, stay with him for a minute more,
then let him go down the hole.

01:47.980 --> 01:50.642
Okay. Fucking great.

01:50.730 --> 01:53.608
Fucking hell. Jesus.

01:53.900 --> 01:55.447
- What?
- There's a fucking rat

01:55.530 --> 01:57.737
on the stairs,
the size of a Cocker Spaniel.

01:59.990 --> 02:03.778
Call me when you've dealt with that,
and not before.

02:03.870 --> 02:06.452
I'll be at my hotel.

02:08.370 --> 02:10.668
A rat, huh?

02:12.460 --> 02:14.758
No business like show business.

03:47.560 --> 03:51.132
This is easy. We paid the $100
for the liquor violation.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.970
You have a month
to pay the other fines.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.142
- My fee is covered.
- What about the girls?

03:55.230 --> 03:57.027
Fines and time served.

03:57.110 --> 03:59.988
You work it out with them directly,
if you want to cover the costs.

04:00.070 --> 04:01.731
Everybody's got
a hand in this, huh?

04:01.820 --> 04:04.402
Just keep your head down,
pay your fines,

04:04.490 --> 04:07.539
stay friendly
with your regular clientele.

04:07.950 --> 04:11.499
Have your client review and sign.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.541
Make sure nothing's missing.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.091
The fucking cigarette machine?

04:31.140 --> 04:34.769
You guys bring an extra set of hands?

04:35.520 --> 04:38.227
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

04:38.320 --> 04:42.438
Let's make it 10:00,
and you're out by 6:00.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.692
- Take a look.
- I never had foreplay like this.

04:45.780 --> 04:47.736
- My girls don't question me.
- What happens when

04:47.830 --> 04:50.196
I look out my window in the morning,
and they're still there?

04:50.290 --> 04:52.360
That shouldn't happen if both sides
stick to the agreement.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.951
If you're here during these hours,
they're not calling the cops.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.371
You get the night traffic
on this street,

04:56.460 --> 04:57.916
but the parking lot's off-limits.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.956
Hold up.
You want us to pick up our own trash?

05:00.050 --> 05:01.836
Motherfucker, look the fuck around.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.540
I guess we can scratch that off.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.210
All right.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.221
Anna, you want to
read over this one more time?

05:19.570 --> 05:22.186
Could my luck get any worse?

05:24.530 --> 05:26.942
Twenty-dollar cunt-fucking bottle.

05:29.910 --> 05:32.071
- Frank/e, it’s Fran.
- Yeah. Hey, Fran.

05:32.160 --> 05:34.537
- Joey was in a ﬁght He there?
- Yeah, he's here.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.240
Your boy got in a tussle.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.001
- The fuck?
- Joey was arrested

05:43.090 --> 05:44.830
for heahng up
the Caro’ucc/ kid at school.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.252
- They took him in.
- After everything I just went through.

05:47.340 --> 05:49.001
Yeah, well, he’s your kid.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.921
Well, he ain't a kid no more.
Which precinct they take him to?

05:52.020 --> 05:54.227
The 68th. He ’5 all by himse/ﬁ
I gotta...

05:56.020 --> 05:57.305
Jesus.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.607
They still smoking herb?
They lie, but we smell it.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.432
Mama, you smell it?
'Cause it's coming from your window.

06:02.530 --> 06:05.397
Everybody knows your son
loves the marijuana, okay?

06:07.160 --> 06:10.368
They're giving you free rein,
protection, for eight hours a day,

06:10.450 --> 06:12.361
and you can't keep
your fucking mouth shut.

06:12.450 --> 06:15.157
Look here, bitch, all right?
You couldn't swing it in the streets,

06:15.250 --> 06:17.616
now, you're out here,
acting like you died for our sins?

06:17.710 --> 06:20.281
- This doesn't have to get personal.
- Oh, shit.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.449
Baby, I'm all business.

06:22.050 --> 06:23.915
So, let's try to be respectful.

06:24.010 --> 06:25.375
Bitch be disrespecting us.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.711
What are we changing
with this bullshit, please?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.927
You always talk about
what's realistic.

06:30.010 --> 06:32.968
When those residents call the cops,
it's the girls who suffer.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.675
So, we're negotiating with the pimps?

06:34.770 --> 06:36.306
We're protecting their bottom line?

06:36.390 --> 06:38.301
All I know, in this situation here,

06:38.390 --> 06:40.017
making the pimps
part of the conversation

06:40.100 --> 06:41.101
is how we stop these arrests.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.527
I know who you are.

06:50.620 --> 06:53.157
They told me to watch out for you,

06:53.240 --> 06:55.538
that you always come
for girls like me.

06:55.660 --> 06:58.652
Does that scare you?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.781
Okay, action, Wolf. Go, Lance.

07:06.380 --> 07:10.089
Little girl, so young, so pretty...

07:13.970 --> 07:14.959
Cut.

07:15.060 --> 07:16.596
And that's take 12.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.843
First of all, fuck the teeth.
Let's just do it without dumb props.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.307
Besides, these caps
cost me four grand.

07:23.650 --> 07:28.098
Ever since you came to fucking town,
all you have done is complain.

07:28.190 --> 07:30.272
Cindy's been sitting here
with a fucking light meter

07:30.360 --> 07:31.520
up her snatch all morning.

07:31.610 --> 07:32.986
I haven't heard
a fucking peep out of her.

07:33.070 --> 07:35.402
Second, this isn't sexy.

07:35.490 --> 07:38.243
Third, Lance Minx
doesn't need to rape a chick.

07:38.330 --> 07:42.369
No. It's not rape. It's her fantasy.
It's gonna be hot.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.030
She's gonna be in control.

07:44.130 --> 07:48.339
You're the Wolf, motherfucker.
You gotta think like a wolf.

07:48.590 --> 07:50.876
Should be looking at her like
you ain't eat in a week,

07:50.970 --> 07:53.211
and her pussy tastes
like porterhouse steak.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.712
Now I'm getting lectures on
fuck films from the bit players.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.973
Son, Lance Minx
was fucking for the camera

08:00.060 --> 08:02.802
when you were jerking off
to the memory of a lost prom date.

08:02.900 --> 08:04.470
Candy, can I please cut this man?

08:05.480 --> 08:06.856
I'm out.

08:07.110 --> 08:09.396
I'll be around the corner
at that bar on 43rd

08:09.490 --> 08:12.311
when you all fix this shit.

08:21.750 --> 08:24.662
Bad, bad Larry Brown.

08:24.790 --> 08:25.779
Yo.

08:27.380 --> 08:29.291
Do they fit?

08:37.680 --> 08:39.921
So, wear them.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.186
All right. Ten minutes?

08:45.730 --> 08:47.971
What are you doing?

08:51.690 --> 08:52.736
What the fuck was that?

08:55.490 --> 08:57.151
Jesus Christ.

08:58.490 --> 09:00.230
You're taking this too personally.

09:00.330 --> 09:02.036
- I'm what?
- I'm just saying that...

09:06.500 --> 09:07.660
Get your ass up.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.415
Know what I think?

09:15.130 --> 09:18.463
I think I'm looking at a bar-back.

09:22.770 --> 09:25.432
We got the cash
because we had the star.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.726
Prima donna though he was.

09:26.810 --> 09:27.936
Hey, you're the one that told me

09:28.020 --> 09:30.727
nobody buys tickets
'cause of the swinging dicks.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.606
They come for the girls.

09:32.690 --> 09:35.818
The backers came in on the promise
of his name on a poster, too.

09:35.910 --> 09:38.731
And now, you're gonna swap him out
with some random black street pimp.

09:38.820 --> 09:40.526
- Hey.
- All due respect, Larry.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.743
Larry Brown's a wolf.
He always has been, he always will be.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.127
Lupine, he is. Guess what?

09:48.210 --> 09:50.622
The last thing
a bunch of white men want to see

09:50.710 --> 09:52.837
- when they're watching their porn...
- Hey. Shame on you.

09:53.210 --> 09:54.666
I'm not talking about me.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.172
I don't care if Red Riding Hood
fucks ten black guys,

09:57.260 --> 10:00.593
a tenement full of Puerto Ricans,
and a Palestinian hijacker.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.170
- Behind the Green Door.
- You cannot promote this!

10:02.270 --> 10:05.888
Behind the Green Door.
Black dude fucks Miss Ivory Snow.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.643
- That's not equivalent...
- Ninety-nine and 44/100% pure.

10:10.230 --> 10:11.766
A million bucks at the box office.

10:11.860 --> 10:13.020
- Excuse me.
- And counting.

10:13.110 --> 10:15.066
You're gonna give the Wolf
the run of the woods in this thing,

10:15.150 --> 10:16.526
Green Door
was one scene.

10:16.610 --> 10:19.408
And everybody talks about it
because it was the exception.

10:19.490 --> 10:21.196
Hey, flesh peddlers.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.407
- What'd I miss?
- Candy fucking fired Lance Minx!

10:24.500 --> 10:26.365
Oh, yeah? What for?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.246
His dick was bent.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.991
- Dick was bent?
- His dick was bent.

10:31.090 --> 10:32.296
This a problem?

10:33.670 --> 10:36.719
When the goombas come
to beat us into risotto,

10:36.800 --> 10:37.869
I hope they grab you first.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.079
- Me?
- Yeah.

10:40.180 --> 10:41.499
The fuck did I do?

10:41.640 --> 10:44.677
I go to lunch,
the whole movie goes to shit?

10:44.770 --> 10:46.920
- The fuck?
- Frankie...

10:47.020 --> 10:48.089
Huh.

10:48.390 --> 10:50.017
I thought you were
gonna talk to Candy.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.181
- What?
- You know, not the grandma.

10:52.270 --> 10:54.977
Like, I should be an aunt
or a cousin or something.

10:55.070 --> 10:58.699
Tina, it doesn't matter, all right?
It's just the way the fairy tale goes.

10:58.780 --> 11:01.157
Hey, fucko.

11:01.240 --> 11:04.232
Does this look like
a grandmother to you?

11:07.870 --> 11:08.950
Hmm?

11:10.250 --> 11:11.820
For real?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.456
- It's Desitin.
-Mmm.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.797
It's the only thing that keeps
my thighs from rubbing together

11:15.880 --> 11:17.836
without looking like
the Pillsbury Doughboy's

11:17.920 --> 11:19.046
hiding in my crotch.

11:20.510 --> 11:21.829
Here.

11:22.050 --> 11:23.711
Fresh pack, baby.

11:27.430 --> 11:28.476
I got two kids with her.

11:28.560 --> 11:31.393
Talking about the mother of my babies
is a bitch-ass ho.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.857
- About to be three.
- What?

11:33.940 --> 11:35.771
She been spending
a lot of time with Joe

11:35.860 --> 11:37.179
while you was out of the house...

11:37.940 --> 11:39.316
You alone tonight?

11:40.360 --> 11:44.069
- Girl, you know it.
-Hmm.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.327
- Most nights.
- Really?

11:46.700 --> 11:50.454
Larry's in a different groove.
Thinks he's a thespian.

11:50.920 --> 11:54.879
What about Darlene?
She still doing the movies?

11:57.800 --> 12:02.089
Well, fuck this.
I'm heading to the Judson bus.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.886
Come on. Come with me.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.553
If Larry comes,
I'll just give him a little...

12:07.640 --> 12:08.629
He ain't coming.

12:08.720 --> 12:10.802
I was thinking we could
use your help, um,

12:10.890 --> 12:13.848
getting to know
some of the new faces around here.

12:16.070 --> 12:20.279
I'll pay you for your time.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.903
Church bus ain't gonna
change my day-to-day.

12:23.070 --> 12:26.654
Yeah, but it'll help
make tonight's count.

12:29.500 --> 12:30.740
Come on.

12:36.290 --> 12:37.587
Yeah.

12:37.670 --> 12:40.412
Red Hot
scene 6-A, take one.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.001
Mark.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.040
And, action.

12:52.440 --> 12:53.725
And window.

13:01.990 --> 13:05.062
- Where Red at?
- She got off an hour ago.

13:05.280 --> 13:08.158
She went uptown, to see her grandma.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.281
I'm getting off now.

13:11.450 --> 13:14.203
I'm looking for Red. You know this.

13:14.540 --> 13:18.579
My, what big eyes you have.

13:20.840 --> 13:22.205
I'm wearing Ray-Bans, you dopey bitch.

13:22.880 --> 13:25.371
You just gonna lie there
with your legs in the air,

13:25.470 --> 13:29.304
- remarking on how big my shit is?
- Shh...

13:29.390 --> 13:32.473
Well, we might as well just get to
the damn point, don't you think?

13:32.560 --> 13:33.970
We didn't write this.

13:34.810 --> 13:38.598
I'm not just selling wolf tickets,
so to speak.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.937
Yeah, we didn't write that, either.
Kind of wish we did.

13:44.030 --> 13:45.816
So, you say she went
to see her granny.

13:46.570 --> 13:48.117
- Yeah.
- Well...

13:48.990 --> 13:53.745
Am I gonna have to huff and puff
and blow this whole booth down?

13:55.750 --> 13:58.162
Or you gonna come over here,

13:58.250 --> 14:01.048
and point me in the right direction?

14:01.170 --> 14:04.958
Hey, Candy,
I thought I was working alone.

14:05.050 --> 14:06.586
This is now a handjob scene?

14:06.680 --> 14:08.079
You wanna go with it?

14:16.020 --> 14:17.089
What's the matter?

14:19.400 --> 14:20.435
Sorry.

14:25.240 --> 14:28.061
It's okay. What's going on?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.525
Hmm?

14:30.120 --> 14:32.486
You know,
Rodney don't take care of me no more.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.868
- Alls I do is take care of him.
- It's the new way.

14:36.210 --> 14:40.499
Sometimes, when I get back
to our apartment, I can't sleep.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.911
Sometimes, I can't even
put my purse down

14:43.000 --> 14:44.410
before he send me back out again.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.330
He makes you score?

14:46.470 --> 14:49.177
His meal ticket and his nurse.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.711
What if I never get off this bus?

14:57.850 --> 15:01.684
Shit.
Fucking my fuck make-up.

15:13.120 --> 15:15.862
- Brought you a new employee.
- Hey, Unc.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.493
Hey. Came to the wrong place.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.332
- What the fuck's going on?
- Vince, he needs a job.

15:27.590 --> 15:30.673
I don't need you dropping
another bag of shit on me.

15:30.760 --> 15:33.046
Listen, he got thrown out of school.
I gotta teach him a lesson.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.348
Gotta be something for him
between this place and The Hi-Hat.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.135
I can't lay this on Abby, all right?

15:38.230 --> 15:40.346
And this place is open
from midnight till 10:00 am.

15:41.770 --> 15:45.103
- Joey's, like, what, 15?
- He's 17.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.226
Going on 30. Don't break anything.

15:49.740 --> 15:51.856
He needs the _rea|_world
to put a boot In hIs ass.

15:52.280 --> 15:56.444
I can't exactly take him to work
with me, can I?

15:56.580 --> 15:59.743
All right, all right. I hear you.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.952
Listen to your Uncle Vince.
He's saving your ass.

16:11.760 --> 16:13.000
Need some dinner?

16:13.470 --> 16:17.258
All right, Candy, Candy,
come on, all I'm saying is,

16:17.350 --> 16:20.422
does it really change the story
if Little Red Riding Hood

16:20.520 --> 16:22.306
is going to visit her aunt's house?

16:22.900 --> 16:24.015
Huh?

16:24.100 --> 16:25.431
I mean, who gives a fuck, really?

16:25.520 --> 16:28.353
Everybody'd rather fuck an aunt
than a grandmother. Right?

16:28.440 --> 16:30.351
Am I right?
I mean, you know what I'm saying.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.896
Frank, you know what a producer does?

16:31.990 --> 16:33.981
- What?
- He solves problems.

16:34.070 --> 16:36.118
- He doesn't cause them.
- This isn't a problem.

16:36.200 --> 16:39.499
Little Red has an aunt
who's hot as balls,

16:39.580 --> 16:42.071
maybe a few years older than she is...

16:42.160 --> 16:45.573
Frankie, you fucking begged me
to throw Tina a part.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.831
I did it. The part's a grandma.

16:47.920 --> 16:50.081
Candy, the zipper broke.

16:51.550 --> 16:53.370
What'd you do? Jumping jacks?

16:53.470 --> 16:56.542
No, I took a breath.
This thing is really tight.

16:56.680 --> 16:59.001
- Stuck?
- Fuck.

16:59.100 --> 17:01.091
Hey, Joss, do we have
another one of these?

17:01.640 --> 17:03.096
- No. No.
- No?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.511
It's established in everything
we shot last night.

17:06.690 --> 17:07.816
Oh, fuck.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.989
Does nobody on this crew know
how to mend a fucking zipper?

17:12.070 --> 17:13.480
Joss, honey, come here.

17:14.450 --> 17:17.066
Here. This...

17:17.160 --> 17:20.618
- Almeda?
- Almunda.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.156
- Almunda.
- Here.

17:23.330 --> 17:25.366
Here you go. Problem solved.

17:27.840 --> 17:28.989
Producer.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.455
No, I ain't lying, nigga.

17:33.170 --> 17:35.832
Oh, man. What?

17:36.050 --> 17:37.381
Hey, Carl.

17:37.470 --> 17:40.212
- I could use a sandwich.
- Yeah.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.670
Here. You have a good one.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.556
Why'd you do that?

17:48.650 --> 17:50.220
- What, Carl?
- Yeah.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.776
Been there for years.

17:51.860 --> 17:54.272
Ever since I started
work in this neighborhood.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.409
That shmoog's been begging for years,
and he's still there?

17:57.490 --> 18:00.277
I mean, he's not even wearing shoes.

18:00.370 --> 18:03.612
Used to call him El Dee.
Wanna guess why?

18:18.090 --> 18:20.422
Watch your fucking head, Tom.
Jesus Christ.

18:20.510 --> 18:23.468
Hey. We gotta get this
in three hours, all right?

18:23.560 --> 18:26.723
They need the lobby back by 5:00 am.
I'm not paying for a second night.

18:26.810 --> 18:28.220
No fucking way. Understand me?

18:28.310 --> 18:30.050
- Yeah, we're gonna get it.
- Yeah, we are.

18:30.150 --> 18:32.266
For a $500 location fee,
you sure as hell will.

18:32.360 --> 18:33.349
- We're gonna get it.
- Yeah.

18:33.440 --> 18:34.680
Hey, what's that movie with the guy,

18:34.780 --> 18:36.736
there's an "M" on
the back of his jacket?

18:36.820 --> 18:38.230
§§Eé§ikesi
gigs; .

18:38.320 --> 18:40.060
- Fritz Lang. Yes.
- Fritz Lang.

18:40.160 --> 18:43.539
Wait. Who the fuck
pays $500 for a location

18:43.620 --> 18:44.860
in a goddamn dirty movie?

18:44.950 --> 18:46.451
- You tell me.
- Hey. Harvey.

18:46.540 --> 18:48.280
- We're gonna get it.
- Yeah. Drop o’eao’.

19:00.260 --> 19:03.093
You had a caller, ma'am.

19:03.180 --> 19:05.307
A gentleman who called?

19:05.390 --> 19:08.473
It's "gentleman caller."

19:08.560 --> 19:10.300
- What?
- "A gentleman caller?"

19:10.400 --> 19:12.106
- Gentleman caller.
- That's all right.

19:12.190 --> 19:14.226
Let's keep rolling. Reset.

19:14.320 --> 19:16.311
It's important to me because
I wrote the fucking thing.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.482
- I don't give a shit. All right?
- And, action.

19:18.570 --> 19:19.605
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you, too.

19:24.370 --> 19:27.032
You had a caller, ma'am.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.400
Oh, Jesus Christ.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.199
You had a caller, ma'am.

19:35.590 --> 19:37.296
A gentleman caller?

19:37.840 --> 19:39.671
I would, in no way,
call him a gentleman.

19:40.510 --> 19:43.968
In fact, he seemed to be a wolf.

19:44.430 --> 19:45.715
Of course, I sent him away.

19:45.850 --> 19:48.421
Well, if he was no gentleman,

19:48.520 --> 19:53.059
then why don't you call him back
and show him upstairs?

19:57.610 --> 20:00.397
"And you
come along as well."

20:00.490 --> 20:01.775
Shit.

20:04.160 --> 20:08.324
Why don't you
show him upstairs, Aldoo?

20:08.410 --> 20:11.152
And you come along as well, too.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.825
That should be "Aldo," Christina.

20:14.210 --> 20:15.950
Fuck. I knew that. Aldo.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.793
- Aldo, Aldo. Got it.
- Yeah.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.916
This stupid fucking thing.
Can I please just smoke

20:21.010 --> 20:22.796
a regular cigarette
like a regular person?

20:22.890 --> 20:24.209
Yes, you can. Let's cut.

20:24.300 --> 20:26.461
- Let's reset.
- No. Fuck! You're killing me!

20:26.560 --> 20:28.960
Twenty-five in the hole
and counting, Eileen.

20:30.770 --> 20:33.011
Hopefully, not much longer.

20:34.770 --> 20:36.681
She'll get better.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.937
No. Aldoo.

20:42.450 --> 20:46.068
Candy, I... I can't fire my wife.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.408
Why not? You hired her.

20:49.700 --> 20:53.864
What the fuck part of solving problems
don't you understand, Mr. Producer?

20:54.750 --> 20:57.833
Okay, all right, let's, uh...

20:58.710 --> 21:00.086
Let's take five.

21:01.630 --> 21:03.461
Here you go.

21:03.550 --> 21:06.212
- Thank you, Vincent.
- Thank you.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.129
Tommy.

21:10.220 --> 21:11.300
Mmm-hmm?

21:13.480 --> 21:14.640
We gonna catch anything more

21:14.730 --> 21:17.016
from that parlor fire,
or is that crazy shit over?

21:18.150 --> 21:19.560
Hard to say. Why do you ask?

21:19.650 --> 21:21.777
I was walking from dinner last night,

21:21.860 --> 21:23.816
felt like some guys had eyes on me.
I don't know.

21:24.110 --> 21:28.399
Some guys? Got any names?

21:30.540 --> 21:33.156
I don't know. Maybe I'm just paranoid.

21:37.500 --> 21:38.660
Parlor weekly.

21:39.130 --> 21:42.088
Your cut on top, Vincent.
So, how'd it go?

21:42.170 --> 21:43.751
I tried to come past
and see last night,

21:43.840 --> 21:45.580
but we were reopening
the French Parlor.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.091
Told him to listen to his Uncle Vince,

21:48.180 --> 21:50.808
- so, if he gave you any shit...
- Look...

21:50.890 --> 21:52.175
I sent him home before we opened.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.049
You got this spic out there,

21:56.730 --> 21:59.301
and you can't find a job
for your own nephew?

21:59.400 --> 22:00.435
He didn't want to be here.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.897
For fuck's sake, we're open
from midnight till morning.

22:02.990 --> 22:06.653
Got drugs in here,
got people half-fucking in the VIP.

22:06.740 --> 22:08.310
You think I want
my kid nephew in here?

22:08.410 --> 22:11.231
It's fucking beautiful to get
parenting lessons from you.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.491
How are your kids?
You spoken to Andrea lately?

22:13.580 --> 22:16.617
- Come on, Bobby.
- You know what? Fuck this.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.950
Hey.

22:25.420 --> 22:26.921
Got fresh pie today, guys.

22:28.550 --> 22:29.630
Listen...

22:30.430 --> 22:32.341
You know, producing has got me

22:32.430 --> 22:36.014
learning a lot
about fiscal responsibility.

22:36.100 --> 22:38.933
People always tell me
it's something I gotta get better at.

22:39.020 --> 22:40.806
Well, you made money
off the dry cleaner.

22:40.900 --> 22:44.188
That is a successful businessman.

22:44.280 --> 22:45.679
Regardless, uh...

22:47.860 --> 22:52.024
I'm thinking, you know, as a producer,
some changes are necessary.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.189
Like what?

22:54.750 --> 22:57.150
Oh, for one, you shouldn't be
playing a grandmother.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.366
I mean, I agree with you on this.

22:59.460 --> 23:02.122
- I'm 28, for fuck's sake.
- Yeah. Exactly.

23:02.590 --> 23:06.082
You should have a bigger part
in a... In a film

23:06.170 --> 23:08.172
a lot more prestigious than this one.

23:08.260 --> 23:09.295
Huh?

23:09.760 --> 23:11.421
Can I get a refill?

23:12.510 --> 23:13.920
You good?

23:15.770 --> 23:17.055
Fuck are you saying?

23:19.190 --> 23:20.509
Look, uh...

23:22.270 --> 23:24.147
I made a mistake.

23:24.230 --> 23:26.778
You should be the hero.
HaVIng your own adventures.

23:27.110 --> 23:30.443
I don't want you playing
second fiddle, you know?

23:30.530 --> 23:32.521
So, fire Lori and make me the lead.

23:35.490 --> 23:36.946
Top you off here, baby?

23:38.790 --> 23:40.997
I didn't think so.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.661
You fucking liar. The producer's wife.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.241
I was in plenty of porn before
you came along, Frankie.

23:45.340 --> 23:48.503
Yeah, and you're gonna be
in a lot more. Very soon.

23:48.590 --> 23:49.875
All right?

23:49.970 --> 23:54.919
And look, I say this
because it's absolutely true.

23:55.060 --> 23:59.474
You are not a grandma, all right?
Not in my book, not ever.

24:00.140 --> 24:01.471
Are you firing me?

24:05.190 --> 24:07.431
Hey, what were you saying
about that pie?

24:09.820 --> 24:11.856
Pie ain't gonna
help you none, brother.

24:13.660 --> 24:16.788
Washington, Adams, Jefferson, Madison,

24:16.870 --> 24:20.579
Monroe, Adams, Jackson, Harrison.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.788
You forgot Van Buren,
and Harrison was barely president.

24:23.880 --> 24:25.199
But he was.

24:25.880 --> 24:27.950
Do you know who was
the first president born in America?

24:30.260 --> 24:33.002
Van Buren. Born after the Revolution.

24:33.090 --> 24:35.593
He was from New York.

24:36.220 --> 24:38.051
Bye.

24:38.140 --> 24:43.260
Washington, Adams, Jefferson,
Madison, Monroe,

24:43.350 --> 24:46.979
Adams, Jackson,

24:47.070 --> 24:49.436
Van Buren, Harrison.

24:51.490 --> 24:55.312
Everything we shot Wednesday?
Fucking left on the train?

24:55.410 --> 24:59.119
Yeah, somewhere on the Canarsie line,
a station master is getting an eyeful.

25:01.750 --> 25:04.412
- Don't tell Harvey.
- No.

25:05.880 --> 25:09.589
No, we're gonna catch up. We just...

25:12.130 --> 25:15.429
and he'll be ready
for some bad news tomorrow.

25:15.550 --> 25:18.963
- Is Frankie around?
- He's sleeping on the second set.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.926
The handle's longer
on that one.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.181
We're losing the head
in the shadow of the door frame.

25:25.270 --> 25:27.602
Maybe you can take a step back?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.522
- Like that? _
- Try It out again.

25:31.610 --> 25:34.397
- Hey, Frankie.
- What?

25:34.490 --> 25:35.696
- Did you sleep here all day?
-Mmm.

25:36.620 --> 25:39.692
Yeah. Christina tossed me.

25:39.780 --> 25:42.999
Oh, shit. I'm sorry about it.

25:46.670 --> 25:50.049
Had to be done, right?

25:50.130 --> 25:51.540
Oh, shit,
you need this couch for fucking?

25:51.630 --> 25:52.870
No, no.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.889
- We need money.
- More?

25:59.970 --> 26:01.881
Yeah. To ﬁnish it.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.636
Like, real money.

26:07.060 --> 26:08.186
Fuck.

26:11.150 --> 26:13.311
I wonder who the Mets are playing?

26:13.690 --> 26:16.488
Just one time.

26:16.570 --> 26:18.197
It's a lot of words for a wolf.

26:18.280 --> 26:21.022
I have my own shit to do,
and time is money.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.577
Or so, my man always told me.

26:23.660 --> 26:26.117
There's a lot on my shoulders.
It's big, the Wolf.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.319
It's my star shot.

26:33.130 --> 26:36.122
So, what if I, uh,

26:38.050 --> 26:39.130
pay you?

26:41.680 --> 26:42.669
Pay me?

26:44.890 --> 26:49.054
- Pay me to read lines with you?
- Yeah.

26:50.230 --> 26:52.642
Yeah, this is some sort of trick

26:52.730 --> 26:55.142
that you're gonna pay me Tuesday
for a hamburger today.

27:16.170 --> 27:18.468
Gentlemen.
Thank you for coming.

27:18.720 --> 27:21.291
I called you together here,
on this emergency basis

27:21.390 --> 27:24.132
for what's known in the film industry
as an emergency.

27:27.520 --> 27:28.760
I need $20,000.

27:31.190 --> 27:32.896
Don't ask me for shit.

27:33.570 --> 27:36.471
I do not require shit. I need cash.

27:36.650 --> 27:39.562
All right? For me and Candy
to finish our film. Huh?

27:40.200 --> 27:44.193
So, last chance to lay a winning bet
down on
Red Hot.

27:44.280 --> 27:47.989
- You're out of your damn mind.
- Twenty grand. Shit.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.780
Nobody's got any ideas? Come on.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.623
I'm out,
and anyone here with half a brain

27:53.710 --> 27:54.836
should be fucking out, too.

27:55.750 --> 27:58.332
Come on, brother.
I'm trying to make a move here.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.423
By making a fuck film? Some move.

28:01.510 --> 28:03.501
And even if you do
put the scratch together,

28:04.470 --> 28:06.711
you're gonna run over
to Aqueduct tomorrow,

28:06.810 --> 28:10.189
shove it up some horse's asshole,
then you'll be back to broke.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.432
What's the fucking point?

28:12.940 --> 28:14.476
This is the new me, Vincent.

28:15.820 --> 28:18.277
New you. You know what?

28:18.610 --> 28:21.852
Confucius say,
"Man born with idiot brother

28:21.950 --> 28:23.611
"die with no fucking money."

28:26.330 --> 28:28.195
Fuck Confucius.

28:29.790 --> 28:31.576
Make my own fortune.

28:32.870 --> 28:34.701
I heard something about something.

28:36.920 --> 28:38.126
What?

28:43.760 --> 28:46.137
Kath. Where's Abby?

28:46.220 --> 28:47.676
Community meeting.

28:48.470 --> 28:50.097
- Where at?
- Ninth Avenue.

28:50.180 --> 28:52.341
The center over there
on 40-whatever.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.977
What are you gonna do to me?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.686
I'm gonna give you
everything you want.

29:06.370 --> 29:09.487
I'm gonna give you
everything you want.

29:10.660 --> 29:14.118
Look, you know the lines.

29:14.210 --> 29:16.667
It's pretty simple.
You're the bad guy.

29:16.750 --> 29:20.049
No. No, that ain't right.

29:20.130 --> 29:25.045
I mean, he's doing what comes natural.
A wolf's gotta wolf.

29:26.680 --> 29:29.092
He's going after the ones
that want it.

29:29.180 --> 29:31.171
I mean, that's the change that Candy
made to the script, right?

29:31.270 --> 29:34.387
He ain't going after the ones
that ain't want it.

29:34.520 --> 29:35.680
He's in the big city,

29:36.020 --> 29:38.181
he's looking for the ones
that are looking for him.

29:38.980 --> 29:41.028
- They hungry, too.
- Not for what they get.

29:41.190 --> 29:43.897
- No one's hungry for that.
-Hmm.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.567
But no one knows what they
gonna get, though, do they?

29:47.660 --> 29:50.288
I mean, ain't no fairy tale out here.

29:50.370 --> 29:52.782
Yeah, well, fairy tales
don't end so good, either, do they?

29:55.080 --> 29:56.069
This one will.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.669
We're finding the more residents
call on the cops

30:02.760 --> 30:04.330
to patrol prostitution,

30:04.420 --> 30:08.049
the less protection there is
against violent crime and theft.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.428
For every prostitution arrest,
the cops spend about seven hours

30:11.510 --> 30:13.341
back at the precinct
processing the women.

30:13.430 --> 30:16.934
And even more time over at
the courthouses and in the Tombs.

30:17.480 --> 30:20.142
The cops make their quotas,

30:20.230 --> 30:22.858
but the basis for these arrests
isn't solicitation.

30:24.190 --> 30:27.853
It's being a woman, in public,
looking a certain way.

30:27.950 --> 30:30.771
The pimps and the johns?
They're never arrested.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.690
- You know that's true.
- Yeah, and then they have to

30:32.790 --> 30:36.282
get right back out into the street
and pay the fine.

30:36.410 --> 30:39.322
These_ laws trea_t women
like little girls,

30:39.420 --> 30:41.206
and it's the women
who are paying the price.

30:41.290 --> 30:43.622
- Do you know who she is?
- If we can make an agreement work...

30:43.710 --> 30:45.257
- She runs a bar.
- ...on a community level,

30:45.340 --> 30:46.409
then we can advocate

30:46.510 --> 30:48.125
- She knows of what she speaks.
- ...change city-wide.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.209
And correct these injustices...

30:49.300 --> 30:50.426
- Always.
- ...towards the women.

30:50.510 --> 30:52.171
I'd like to introduce Dave Hiller

30:52.260 --> 30:54.592
whose idea it was to work
with the tenants' council.

31:01.810 --> 31:03.437
We taking it all out?

31:08.360 --> 31:12.694
- I mean...
- Wait. Which scene is this?

31:12.780 --> 31:14.736
It's the ladies on the Wolf.

31:14.830 --> 31:16.240
No, that shoots on our set.

31:16.750 --> 31:21.073
Fuck our fucking set.
Look at that. It shoots right here.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.245
Here, on a parking lot?

31:23.340 --> 31:26.127
Not now.
Later, when there's nobody around.

31:30.130 --> 31:31.586
Say hi to the girls.

31:34.970 --> 31:37.928
That's Bernice, she pretty much
runs the place at this point.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.846
This is Anita, Portia,

31:40.940 --> 31:43.431
and that is Marilys.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.390
- Hey.
- My son. Joey.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.529
He has manners, I promise.
Where's Black Frankie?

31:48.610 --> 31:50.100
He say he on a caper tonight.

31:50.280 --> 31:51.406
A caper?

31:56.950 --> 32:00.329
So, Bring Your Kid to Work Day, huh?

32:22.980 --> 32:26.143
Me being a television star,

32:26.230 --> 32:27.686
you want me to keep pretending
you don't know?

32:30.700 --> 32:32.315
Come with me.

32:43.040 --> 32:44.246
Come on.

32:50.630 --> 32:53.212
First, you clean the break room,
then you vacuum,

32:53.300 --> 32:55.507
then you go to Bernice, you ask her
what else she needs tonight.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.052
You got me working with that shmoog.

32:58.140 --> 33:00.927
Joey, that shmoog is your boss.

33:08.860 --> 33:10.145
Sit. Eat.

33:11.110 --> 33:15.274
Can't. My call's in 30 minutes.
We're shooting outside tonight.

33:17.660 --> 33:18.695
I got paid.

33:23.210 --> 33:27.704
So, uh, how's it going
on-set with Sir Wolf Lancelot?

33:28.210 --> 33:29.996
VVho?

33:31.510 --> 33:35.423
Lance Mink. Or Lance Dink.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.040
Whatever the fuck
pretty boy calls himself.

33:38.140 --> 33:39.175
Mmm.

33:42.430 --> 33:44.341
Man, that's so fucked up.

33:45.650 --> 33:48.141
- Oh, he's an asshole?
- They threw me a fucking curveball.

33:48.230 --> 33:51.028
They sent Lance home, then guess
who Candy decides to recast?

33:52.990 --> 33:56.062
Fucking Larry Brown.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.697
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm. Can you fucking believe it?

33:59.780 --> 34:03.443
I mean, I'm with you, right,
and now, I have to pretend

34:03.540 --> 34:07.078
to be with some popcorn pimp
we've known for years?

34:07.170 --> 34:08.159
Jesus.

34:14.760 --> 34:17.968
Shit. I don't care about Larry.

34:18.140 --> 34:22.099
He ain't even a real pimp anymore.
Just a trick.

34:24.310 --> 34:27.097
I mean, it's not like
they're paying you less, right?

34:28.270 --> 34:29.305
Mmm-mmm.

34:40.990 --> 34:44.494
See? She ain't gonna lie to me.

34:44.580 --> 34:47.822
None of us would, Daddy.

34:51.630 --> 34:55.009
Okay, that's beautiful.
Now, let's start the lines again.

34:57.340 --> 35:01.549
This is all well and fine,
but you all know I'm in town

35:01.640 --> 35:03.710
looking for the one
they call Little Red.

35:05.100 --> 35:08.433
Gimme a line on her,
I'll let you both live.

35:08.520 --> 35:10.260
Are we gonna really hang around
for insert shots,

35:10.350 --> 35:11.681
- or can we do that later on set?
- Yes.

35:11.770 --> 35:13.146
Look at the fucking light.

35:13.230 --> 35:15.141
- Yes. Let's fucking get them.
- Jesus.

35:16.820 --> 35:18.356
Huh?

35:20.240 --> 35:22.231
- Okay, cover them up.
- Shit.

35:22.330 --> 35:24.230
- Cover them up.
- Who's got the bail money?

35:27.750 --> 35:28.739
Hi.

35:30.120 --> 35:31.496
Fuck is all this?

35:32.000 --> 35:35.913
We're, uh... We're shooting a scene
from a student film.

35:36.880 --> 35:39.963
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, uh,

35:40.050 --> 35:42.177
seeing is believing.

35:44.560 --> 35:48.178
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

35:50.900 --> 35:54.017
Okay, let's, uh...
Let's get back into position.

35:54.110 --> 35:55.225
Everybody, back to one.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.856
- Frame up.
- Roll sound.

35:56.940 --> 35:58.851
- Sound speed.
- Roll camera.

35:58.950 --> 36:00.440
- Rolling.
- Okay.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.406
Eighteen Apple, take three.

36:02.490 --> 36:04.526
And, action.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.788
I love this fucking town.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.549
What I'm trying to say is,

36:16.630 --> 36:20.839
that I've been carrying this lie
for a long time.

36:21.010 --> 36:22.637
With everybody.

36:22.720 --> 36:26.349
With you,
and myself in some weird way.

36:28.470 --> 36:32.554
It's like, I knew what I knew,
I put it into a box,

36:32.650 --> 36:37.189
and then I never wanted to
open the box and look at it.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.856
I know that barely makes sense.

36:38.940 --> 36:42.444
I... I backed myself
into this years ago.

36:42.530 --> 36:43.861
First with this bar,

36:44.320 --> 36:46.948
and then they came to me
about the parlors, and I said no.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.861
But Bobby, he wanted that.

36:48.950 --> 36:52.909
And I was the one
that they could trust,

36:53.000 --> 36:54.661
so, then the parlors.

36:54.750 --> 36:58.049
And then me at 3-6-6,
Paul at his bar downtown,

36:58.210 --> 37:00.041
and Frankie
with all the goddamn peeps.

37:00.130 --> 37:02.166
They're not just landlords,
or backers,

37:02.260 --> 37:04.171
or however I made it sound to you.

37:04.260 --> 37:06.592
So, all the envelopes go the Mob?

37:10.220 --> 37:11.426
Even mine?

37:11.520 --> 37:15.342
Yeah, but I'm not lying anymore.
I don't know how to get out.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.977
And I don't know what's gonna
happen to Bobby, or Frankie,

37:18.070 --> 37:19.276
or the girls, or anybody.

37:19.900 --> 37:24.064
And, you know, it's not like
it's just gonna stop if I leave.

37:25.030 --> 37:27.362
Fucking thing's a machine,
it just runs and runs and runs.

37:27.660 --> 37:29.571
The girls are your responsibility.

37:29.660 --> 37:31.366
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.821
And me lying to you all these years,

37:38.040 --> 37:41.544
putting it off on Bobby and Frankie,

37:41.670 --> 37:44.628
pretending that
I could just step away,

37:46.680 --> 37:48.420
that's on me, too.

37:51.850 --> 37:53.761
I'm sorry, Abby.

37:54.850 --> 37:57.978
I knew.

37:58.060 --> 37:59.266
At least I think I knew.

38:02.490 --> 38:05.607
Maybe I was lying, too.

38:11.580 --> 38:13.366
So, what are you gonna do now?

38:14.160 --> 38:17.209
I don't know. Uh...

38:17.290 --> 38:20.168
I know I'm not taking
another dollar from the parlors.

38:23.090 --> 38:27.254
My cut's right there. It's for you.

38:27.390 --> 38:29.756
For me?

38:29.850 --> 38:32.671
What the fuck do I want
with your fucking parlor money?

38:32.770 --> 38:36.058
You'll know where it should go,
and you can do something good with it.

38:36.140 --> 38:39.018
- Vincent, I don't want it.
- Well, I don't want it, either.

38:40.610 --> 38:43.022
I'm not picking it up.

38:56.250 --> 38:59.162
It'll be here when you look for it.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.397
Did you hear the game?
Fucking Amos Otis

39:19.600 --> 39:22.307
with a walk-off home run in the ninth.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.931
And it was inside the park.
What the fuck is that?

39:26.490 --> 39:27.559
All right, here we go.

39:50.260 --> 39:51.295
Oh, fuck.

39:54.560 --> 39:56.710
Take it. I didn't see anything.

39:59.560 --> 40:02.939
When they ask you who did this,
go on and say what you gonna say,

40:03.020 --> 40:05.352
"Two niggas ran up on me."

40:06.280 --> 40:07.736
Gimme your wallet.

40:08.530 --> 40:10.100
Let's go.

40:14.080 --> 40:17.038
Walter Mayer from Hoboken.

40:17.120 --> 40:19.748
- What's your boy's name?
- Tommy.

40:20.750 --> 40:23.457
Good name. Fine name.

40:23.580 --> 40:24.990
Just walk on, Walter Mayer.

40:27.300 --> 40:30.007
Forget enough,
so that I never come to Jersey.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.933
You got me out late, Francis.
Let's see what we're selling.

41:27.020 --> 41:30.069
Look, uh, Mr. Pipilo,
I don't know how this happened.

41:30.780 --> 41:34.272
- I honestly don't.
- What's the problem?

41:36.530 --> 41:38.486
Two left feet.

41:44.750 --> 41:47.708
They've doing this shit because
we been robbing them blind.

41:47.790 --> 41:49.587
They sent the left shoes in one truck,

41:49.670 --> 41:51.752
- and the rights in the other.
- Fuck me.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.410
So you saying we gotta hijack
the right-shoe truck,

41:53.510 --> 41:54.499
and we'll be good to go?

41:57.800 --> 41:58.846
As opposed to...

41:59.890 --> 42:01.926
- Who tipped you to this?
- Carlos.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.227
This motherfucker.

42:04.640 --> 42:08.019
Oh, man. You guys, you are
my favorite crew out here.

42:08.980 --> 42:11.858
I respect the ambition.

42:11.940 --> 42:13.100
Whoo!

42:13.440 --> 42:17.649
Well, be that as it may, uh...

42:17.740 --> 42:20.368
I'm still fucked.
At least, my movie is.

42:21.370 --> 42:23.497
- What movie?
- Oh, it's a porno, but,

42:23.580 --> 42:25.957
you know, it's like a real film.

42:26.040 --> 42:27.826
Little Red Riding Hood
in the big city,

42:28.290 --> 42:30.167
Lori Madison in red.

42:30.250 --> 42:32.081
Yeah, the film looks fucking great,

42:32.170 --> 42:34.752
but, you know, it's costing a lot more
than it usually does,

42:34.840 --> 42:37.889
and me being a producer and all...

42:38.640 --> 42:40.881
And you're making this movie
right now?

42:42.140 --> 42:44.222
Yeah. Yeah.

42:48.480 --> 42:50.220
Check the cars, check the cars.

42:50.860 --> 42:52.350
Candy, this looks empty.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.526
No, there's a couple
of guys in here.

42:54.820 --> 42:57.027
I think that last one's
our best bet.

43:00.070 --> 43:01.116
Empty here.

43:02.870 --> 43:05.156
How we gonna keep people
from getting on?

43:05.250 --> 43:06.706
They get to be
part of the movie.

43:06.790 --> 43:09.111
Okay, it's 3:00
in the fucking morning.

43:09.210 --> 43:12.122
We got two mags of film,
we got a subway car,

43:12.210 --> 43:13.950
we got 15 stops till Inwood.

43:14.050 --> 43:16.120
Woodsman, get your fucking pants off.

43:16.220 --> 43:17.960
Little Red, get naked.

43:18.050 --> 43:21.429
All right, freaks,
let's shoot this fucking movie!

43:21.510 --> 43:23.842
Joss, where's my axe?

43:51.000 --> 43:53.161
I don't get it.
Am I the sweet, innocent girl,

43:53.250 --> 43:54.706
or am I the seductive slut?

43:54.800 --> 43:58.873
No. First, you're one,
and then you're the other.

44:00.090 --> 44:01.250
Sometimes, you're both.

44:02.260 --> 44:05.889
I know, it can be confusing
when you shoot the story out of order.

44:08.480 --> 44:10.380
Or, you know,

44:11.100 --> 44:13.398
you could work those dimples, baby.

44:13.980 --> 44:16.107
Cut glass with those dimples.

44:19.950 --> 44:23.067
It's weird being out
on the old stroll.

44:23.240 --> 44:26.403
For me, anyway.

44:26.490 --> 44:31.496
You know, the first time I met you,
I think we were right over there.

44:32.620 --> 44:35.919
C.C. got you to come over and ask me
for a light or something, remember?

44:38.550 --> 44:39.790
Mmm-mmm.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.336
Yeah, you do.

44:43.930 --> 44:45.670
You ever think back on that first day?

44:46.890 --> 44:49.927
You stepped off the bus...

44:50.180 --> 44:53.934
From where, fucking Hicksville?

44:54.020 --> 44:57.808
Want so bad to take a bite
out of the Big Apple.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.106
And how it felt.

45:02.610 --> 45:05.943
Ready to conquer.
Everything was yours.

45:07.620 --> 45:09.406
Nothing could hurt you.

45:13.370 --> 45:15.577
Never felt that way.

45:15.670 --> 45:18.457
- I was never like that.
- No?

45:21.920 --> 45:24.172
Could've fooled me.

45:30.640 --> 45:33.017
Hey, Candy. The camera's ready.

45:59.340 --> 46:00.409
Here it is.

46:05.300 --> 46:09.088
What, that camera's so heaw,
they gotta put him in a wheelchair?

46:09.180 --> 46:10.249
Yeah.

46:11.180 --> 46:13.057
And, action.

46:14.890 --> 46:16.517
Okay, go ahead, go ahead.

46:33.700 --> 46:34.746
Oh, my God.

46:34.830 --> 46:36.661
- Holy shit.
- Fuck!

46:37.330 --> 46:38.410
Are you okay?

46:45.920 --> 46:49.219
Officer. Officer. He's not chasing her
for real. He's an actor.

46:49.300 --> 46:50.847
- Huh?
- He's not really chasing her for real.

46:50.930 --> 46:51.919
We're making a movie.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.637
We got a camera and lights...

46:53.720 --> 46:55.347
Once, uh...
Once we hit him, he's gotta go.

46:55.430 --> 46:57.057
Officer, he didn't do anything.

46:57.140 --> 46:58.801
Sorry, lady. All right, come on, pal.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.390
This is fucked up!

47:00.480 --> 47:01.515
Where are you guys taking him?

47:01.610 --> 47:03.180
That was fucking great.

47:03.280 --> 47:05.145
That looked like
they really threw him a beating.

47:06.820 --> 47:07.809
Yeah.

47:09.280 --> 47:12.192
I'll give you 20 grand
for 25% right now.

47:13.290 --> 47:14.359
Deal.

47:36.350 --> 47:37.806
Paul's opening's tonight.

47:41.230 --> 47:43.221
Can't miss that.

47:56.330 --> 47:58.787
- All right.
- They're still in the truck.

47:58.870 --> 48:00.861
The glass is too thick.

48:00.960 --> 48:02.825
Four more round tables.

48:04.710 --> 48:06.587
Don't get caught up
in this last-minute stuff.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.831
- You're not in this alone.
-Mmm.

48:08.920 --> 48:10.831
- I'll put out the fires.
- Okay.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.346
Someone's coming to hook up
the sound equipment, right?

48:14.430 --> 48:17.137
I have no idea which cable goes where.

48:17.220 --> 48:19.222
Right. Yeah, okay.

48:20.310 --> 48:23.518
We, uh, still owe everything.

48:23.940 --> 48:27.683
Grandma's bedroom
and the reshoot on the park sequence,

48:27.780 --> 48:31.523
which Fuck-Nuts
left on the, uh, subway train.

48:31.610 --> 48:33.407
But hey, the good news is,

48:33.490 --> 48:35.867
I got the uptown lobby location
back at half-price.

48:35.950 --> 48:37.076
Great.

48:37.160 --> 48:39.071
We're gonna have to hire
another Grandma

48:39.160 --> 48:41.742
before we reshoot that, so...

48:42.500 --> 48:44.377
Bottom line is, we're broke,

48:44.460 --> 48:47.293
and you're, what, almost a week shy
of filming a movie?

48:47.380 --> 48:50.042
- How broke?
- Thirty-five in the hole.

48:50.130 --> 48:51.210
Okay.

48:52.880 --> 48:54.211
I'll do the Grandma.

48:54.300 --> 48:56.131
- For free.
- Well, yeah.

48:56.220 --> 48:57.926
But she's Aunt Sue now.

49:00.180 --> 49:03.399
And she's hot as fuck.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.521
Candy. I gotta show you this.

49:08.860 --> 49:11.988
All I know is, she needs
to get settled somewhere else.

49:12.070 --> 49:13.731
And a bus ticket's one thing,

49:13.820 --> 49:17.574
but I might as well buy her
a round-trip fare.

49:17.660 --> 49:19.821
How much you thinking?

49:19.910 --> 49:20.899
Few thousand.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.740
Enough to get a place
and buy some time,

49:22.830 --> 49:25.128
- so, she can look for a job.
- We don't do that.

49:25.210 --> 49:26.370
The funds we have are limited,

49:26.460 --> 49:28.701
and go towards hiring staff
and doing outreach.

49:28.800 --> 49:30.756
Trying to effect large-scale change.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.967
Mmm-hmm. _ _
Yeah, one community meeting at a time.

49:33.430 --> 49:34.886
In the long run, that's how it works.

49:34.970 --> 49:38.462
Not for Chocolate.

49:38.560 --> 49:40.346
Dorothy,

49:41.600 --> 49:43.727
if we get into the business

49:43.810 --> 49:46.392
of trying to fund
every single escape story,

49:46.480 --> 49:49.779
we're gonna lose the chance to
change anything in a real way.

49:50.150 --> 49:52.391
The people with Judson, they're gonna
lose credibility with pimps

49:52.490 --> 49:55.562
- if it gets out that...
- Fuck the fucking pimps.

49:56.070 --> 49:58.732
Is this all so
you can get even With Rodney?

49:58.830 --> 50:01.788
Over one of his girls?
Or is this about C.C.?

50:02.290 --> 50:03.780
Because if it's down to that...

50:15.220 --> 50:17.040
At last. ,4 wolf.

50:17.140 --> 50:18.346
Yoo-hoo/

50:18.550 --> 50:20.006
Whatfs your hurry, Harry?

50:24.730 --> 50:27.301
Fuck the woodsman, right?

50:27.400 --> 50:30.892
Oh, yeah. We got this.

50:34.700 --> 50:35.985
Hey.

51:05.230 --> 51:07.596
- You look great.
- Thanks.

51:11.150 --> 51:12.469
Yeah.

51:20.820 --> 51:24.608
- Hey. This is erotic to you?
- Yeah.

51:24.700 --> 51:26.782
The... The "You tried my door before,
now you don't have to..."

51:26.870 --> 51:30.374
Not just me.
Men and women are different beasts.

51:30.460 --> 51:33.839
Yeah, one of us are beasts.

51:33.920 --> 51:36.718
When it comes to fucking,
we're all beasts.

51:37.550 --> 51:38.960
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey.

51:46.180 --> 51:49.013
- What's this?
- Open it.

51:49.310 --> 51:50.766
Holy shit.

51:52.860 --> 51:55.272
- How much?
- Eh, twenty K.

51:55.360 --> 51:57.146
What the fuck are you talking about?

51:57.240 --> 51:59.731
Twenty-fucking K.

52:00.110 --> 52:03.022
- What?
- What the fuck?

52:03.120 --> 52:04.519
Now, that's a producer.

52:04.620 --> 52:07.748
Frankie. Oh, my God.

52:09.250 --> 52:10.660
It's all over here.

52:12.880 --> 52:14.836
Hey, Frankie,
you wearing two left shoes?

52:17.800 --> 52:19.665
Yes, I am.

52:31.140 --> 52:33.552
Tod. Hey, how are you?

52:34.730 --> 52:38.029
Thank you. Your jacket is gorgeous.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.605
You got chandeliers
in this joint?

52:42.240 --> 52:43.650
Oh, shit. Yeah.

52:43.740 --> 52:44.900
Hey.

52:47.290 --> 52:49.155
Come here. All right, all right.

52:49.250 --> 52:50.956
- Man.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.621
- Good to see you.
- Congratulations.

52:53.710 --> 52:56.497
- Thank you. To you as well.
- I'm impressed.

52:56.590 --> 52:57.625
I'm impressed.

52:58.550 --> 53:00.120
It's amazing.

53:40.340 --> 53:41.455
Uh...

53:44.890 --> 53:47.256
Thank you all for coming.
