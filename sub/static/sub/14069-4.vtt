WEBVTT

00:00.064 --> 00:01.524
<i>Previously on "Suits"...</i>

00:01.526 --> 00:03.578
<i>Rachel,</i>
<i>it's Professor Dunbar.</i>

00:03.679 --> 00:05.657
I was wondering if you'd
be interested in helping me

00:05.681 --> 00:07.114
<i>with the Innocence Project.</i>

00:07.149 --> 00:09.094
You want me to help you get
an innocent man off death row?

00:09.118 --> 00:10.084
<i>What do you want, Harvey?</i>

00:10.119 --> 00:11.418
Help me protect Mike Ross.

00:11.454 --> 00:12.564
He's in there
with a guy I put away,

00:12.588 --> 00:13.554
and the guy is no joke.

00:13.589 --> 00:14.955
What am I supposed to do?

00:14.991 --> 00:17.224
You're supposed to move
the guy to another prison.

00:17.259 --> 00:18.826
You want me one-on-one?
You got it.

00:18.861 --> 00:20.794
I'm gonna use this,
and they're gonna hold you.

00:20.830 --> 00:22.162
- No!
- What's going on here?

00:23.766 --> 00:25.165
Why'd you come back
with a guard?

00:25.201 --> 00:26.712
I didn't do it
to get you to forgive me.

00:26.736 --> 00:28.780
I never should have let him
in here in the first place.

00:28.804 --> 00:30.537
The time you served
while awaiting trial

00:30.573 --> 00:32.473
was never factored
into your sentence.

00:32.508 --> 00:34.274
You're eligible for
parole in six weeks.

00:34.310 --> 00:36.410
You think I don't know
this is your protector's idea

00:36.445 --> 00:37.544
to get me off your back?

00:37.580 --> 00:38.812
Nah, Frank.

00:38.848 --> 00:41.248
Harvey's idea was for me
to tell these guys

00:41.283 --> 00:42.449
that you're an informant.

00:42.485 --> 00:44.351
I figured out a way
to get Mike out early.

00:44.387 --> 00:45.352
What's the catch?

00:45.388 --> 00:46.687
He has to inform
on his roommate.

00:46.722 --> 00:48.222
Mike gets him to turn,
he's free.

00:48.257 --> 00:49.490
When do you need an answer by?

00:49.525 --> 00:50.624
Yesterday.

00:50.660 --> 00:51.959
And the answer needs to be yes.

00:54.930 --> 00:55.963
Harvey, wait a second.

00:55.998 --> 00:56.964
Where are you going?

00:56.999 --> 00:58.143
Where do you think I'm going?

00:58.167 --> 00:59.199
I'm gonna see Mike.

00:59.235 --> 01:00.612
And I know what
you're going to say,

01:00.636 --> 01:02.703
but Mike went to prison
so we wouldn't have to,

01:02.738 --> 01:04.971
and now he's in danger
from a guy I put away.

01:05.007 --> 01:07.341
So you'll forgive me if
I don't stand around and wait

01:07.376 --> 01:08.776
for you to drop the hammer.

01:08.811 --> 01:11.211
You think I like the idea
of him rotting in that place?

01:11.247 --> 01:12.713
But if you want
this thing to work,

01:12.748 --> 01:14.893
you can't go running up there
in the middle of the night.

01:14.917 --> 01:16.850
You heard Cahill.
He needs an answer yesterday.

01:16.886 --> 01:18.886
What he needs is results.

01:18.921 --> 01:20.699
And if Mike's lawyer
pulls him out of his cell

01:20.723 --> 01:22.467
in the middle of the night,
then his roommate

01:22.491 --> 01:24.124
is going to sense
there's something wrong

01:24.160 --> 01:26.894
before this thing
even gets started.

01:26.929 --> 01:29.830
Fine, but I'm going up there
first thing in the morning,

01:29.865 --> 01:32.332
and nothing you say
is going to stop me.

01:40.376 --> 01:41.742
Can't sleep?

01:41.777 --> 01:43.210
Not really.

01:43.245 --> 01:44.778
Well, as long as you're up,

01:44.814 --> 01:45.779
might want to think about

01:45.815 --> 01:47.681
putting up some
pictures of your own.

01:47.717 --> 01:50.851
That way, you won't have
to keep staring at mine.

01:54.790 --> 01:57.925
How old are they?

01:57.960 --> 02:00.594
Maddy is seven.

02:00.629 --> 02:03.263
Nate just turned five.

02:03.299 --> 02:05.499
They look really sweet.

02:05.534 --> 02:08.869
Yeah...they're great.

02:08.904 --> 02:10.704
How often do you
get to see 'em?

02:10.740 --> 02:12.250
- I don't.
- What do you mean you don't?

02:12.274 --> 02:13.240
Bad divorce or something?

02:13.275 --> 02:15.008
Nah, nah,
nothing like that.

02:15.044 --> 02:16.844
We've been married
for ten years.

02:16.879 --> 02:18.390
I just--I just don't
let 'em come here.

02:18.414 --> 02:19.613
What?
Why not?

02:19.648 --> 02:21.515
They shouldn't see
their father as a criminal.

02:21.550 --> 02:22.516
Kevin, come on, man.

02:22.551 --> 02:23.717
I know it's hard on them.

02:23.753 --> 02:25.652
It tears me up every
single day that I'm here.

02:25.688 --> 02:29.156
But they're kids.
They're resilient.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.758
Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.

02:30.793 --> 02:32.092
Well, Mike,
you don't have kids.

02:32.128 --> 02:33.128
So you don't know.

02:33.162 --> 02:34.461
No.
I don't.

02:34.497 --> 02:37.264
But I do know what it's like
to be a kid missing his dad.

02:37.299 --> 02:40.467
Please don't tell me your
old man abandoned the family.

02:40.503 --> 02:45.305
Both of my parents died
in a car accident when I was 11.

02:45.341 --> 02:47.307
Hit by a drunk driver.

02:47.343 --> 02:50.444
Jesus, that's...
I'm sorry, Mike.

02:52.348 --> 02:55.549
Yeah, it was a long time ago.

02:55.584 --> 02:57.384
Kevin, I understand
the instinct to protect

02:57.419 --> 02:59.887
your children, but what are
you protecting them from?

02:59.922 --> 03:01.188
What do you mean?

03:01.223 --> 03:02.956
I mean we've been
roommates for a while now.

03:02.992 --> 03:06.093
Don't you think it's time you
told me what you're in here for?

03:07.696 --> 03:09.029
Hey, Ross.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.130
Your lawyer's here.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.665
- Now?
- I'm just the messenger.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.667
You want out of this box or not?

03:34.356 --> 03:36.190
Mr. Bailey, my name
is Rachel Zane.

03:36.225 --> 03:37.791
I am a law student at Columbia,

03:37.827 --> 03:39.626
and I'm here to talk
to you about your case.

03:39.662 --> 03:40.794
Student?

03:40.830 --> 03:42.763
Yes, we work alongside
the Innocence Project

03:42.798 --> 03:44.810
to determine if you have
the criteria for an appeal.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.634
Do you know how long
I've been sittin' on death row?

03:47.670 --> 03:49.636
12 years.
I read your file.

03:49.672 --> 03:52.206
And for the last ten of 'em,
I've been writing letters

03:52.241 --> 03:55.943
and begging any lawyer
to listen to my story.

03:55.978 --> 03:59.213
And they finally get around
to getting back to me,

03:59.248 --> 04:01.081
and they don't even
have the courtesy

04:01.116 --> 04:03.016
of sendin' me a real lawyer?

04:03.052 --> 04:06.386
Mr. Bailey, trust me,
I will fight for you.

04:06.422 --> 04:08.522
You're a student.

04:08.557 --> 04:11.859
You can't do shit for me.

04:11.894 --> 04:14.428
Well, you know what?
You killed two people.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.829
In cold blood.

04:16.866 --> 04:19.233
You know it, and I know it,
and that's why you're in there,

04:19.267 --> 04:20.934
so thank you
for making the decision

04:20.970 --> 04:23.871
to not take your case
an easy one.

04:23.906 --> 04:25.205
You don't know me.

04:25.241 --> 04:29.343
All you know is what you
read in some damn file.

04:29.378 --> 04:31.478
I didn't kill anyone.

04:31.513 --> 04:34.314
I've been saying it for 12 years
and I can prove it.

04:34.350 --> 04:35.315
You're right.

04:35.351 --> 04:36.516
I don't know you.

04:36.552 --> 04:39.186
And you don't know me either.

04:39.221 --> 04:43.357
So do you want to take
a chance on each other or not?

04:43.392 --> 04:48.262
I need help, Ms. Zane.

04:49.765 --> 04:52.199
So let me help you.

04:56.438 --> 04:57.738
Harvey, what are
you doing here?

04:57.773 --> 04:59.573
There's something I need
to talk to you about.

04:59.608 --> 05:00.574
Sit down.

05:00.609 --> 05:03.377
What is it?

05:03.412 --> 05:05.112
I just got a visit
from Sean Cahill.

05:05.147 --> 05:06.446
About Gallo?

05:06.482 --> 05:07.959
I thought you said
he can't get him transferred.

05:07.983 --> 05:09.549
He can't, but it turns out

05:09.585 --> 05:10.795
there's a way
he can get you out.

05:10.819 --> 05:11.919
What do you mean "out"?

05:11.954 --> 05:15.055
I mean out, as in
you walk out that front door

05:15.090 --> 05:17.324
and you never look back.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.792
- What's the catch?
- Mike--

05:18.827 --> 05:20.872
Harvey, you're not here
telling me that I can get out

05:20.896 --> 05:21.862
with that look on your face

05:21.897 --> 05:23.074
if there isn't something else.

05:23.098 --> 05:24.665
He needs you to inform
on your cellmate.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.732
What?

05:25.768 --> 05:27.178
If whatever you get
leads to a conviction

05:27.202 --> 05:28.368
on his father-in-law,

05:28.404 --> 05:30.671
he'll commute your sentence
and you get to walk.

05:32.341 --> 05:34.107
- What'd the guy do?
- Who cares what he did?

05:34.143 --> 05:35.676
I care,
because if it was so bad,

05:35.711 --> 05:37.255
why didn't Kevin turn on him
in the first place?

05:37.279 --> 05:38.245
Mike, what does it matter?

05:38.280 --> 05:39.280
He can get you out.

05:39.315 --> 05:41.114
This is my only
friend in here.

05:41.150 --> 05:42.115
I'm not gonna betray him.

05:42.151 --> 05:43.684
Friend?
Listen to me, God damn it.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.519
There's someone in here
trying to kill you

05:45.554 --> 05:46.720
and I'm giving you a way out.

05:46.755 --> 05:47.755
I'm taking care of Gallo.

05:47.790 --> 05:49.000
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

05:49.024 --> 05:50.602
It means that I did
what you told me to do.

05:50.626 --> 05:52.671
I threatened to tell people
that he was an informant,

05:52.695 --> 05:55.028
but what I also did was found
out a way to get him parole.

05:55.064 --> 05:56.763
Parole?
Are you crazy?

05:56.799 --> 05:58.098
He's not gonna get parole.

05:58.133 --> 05:59.099
Who's gonna say he deserves it?

05:59.134 --> 06:00.167
You know what, Harvey?

06:00.202 --> 06:01.546
Instead of coming here
and telling me

06:01.570 --> 06:03.381
to betray my cellmate because
Gallo will never get parole,

06:03.405 --> 06:05.083
maybe you should be helping
me get it for him.

06:05.107 --> 06:07.274
I'm never helping that
piece of shit do anything,

06:07.309 --> 06:09.242
and this isn't about Gallo
and you know it.

06:09.278 --> 06:11.556
No, it's about you telling me
to turn on the one guy in here

06:11.580 --> 06:13.780
that I trust based on
some plan that Cahill has

06:13.816 --> 06:15.026
that we don't even
know will work.

06:15.050 --> 06:16.283
No, Mike.

06:16.318 --> 06:18.296
It's about giving you
a chance to get your life back

06:18.320 --> 06:20.921
while it still looks the same.

06:20.956 --> 06:23.423

to take it or not?

07:13.669 --> 07:14.635
What the?

07:14.670 --> 07:16.837
Hey, douche stick.

07:16.872 --> 07:19.173
Are you responsible
for my mugs being here?

07:19.208 --> 07:23.443
I didn't--I don't--we didn't
have anything else to use.

07:23.479 --> 07:24.578
I don't give a shit!

07:24.613 --> 07:25.824
Take those things
and put 'em back where--

07:25.848 --> 07:27.080
Well, if it isn't Louis Shit.

07:27.116 --> 07:28.649
What's happening, boss?
You bastard.

07:28.684 --> 07:30.028
You took my mugs,
and you didn't even have

07:30.052 --> 07:31.285
the balls to do it yourself.

07:31.320 --> 07:32.764
I have no idea what
you're talking about,

07:32.788 --> 07:34.199
but if something
of yours is in here,

07:34.223 --> 07:35.663
it had nothing to do with me.
Really?

07:35.691 --> 07:38.692
Why don't you ask
the stuttering ass clown?

07:38.727 --> 07:41.328
We needed them for our...

07:41.363 --> 07:42.796
Urine tests.

07:42.832 --> 07:44.176
What'd you say?
You peed on my catch phrase?

07:44.200 --> 07:45.365
I don't know what's funnier--

07:45.401 --> 07:47.634
you got a catch phrase
or that we peed on it.

07:47.670 --> 07:49.548
I want those mugs sterilized
and I want 'em destroyed.

07:49.572 --> 07:50.982
They're your mugs,
you do what you want,

07:51.006 --> 07:52.350
but I'm not touching 'em
with a ten-foot pole.

07:52.374 --> 07:56.009
You know how much
asparagus Luterman eats?

07:56.045 --> 07:58.145
Later, Chief.

08:06.488 --> 08:07.688
How'd it go this morning?

08:07.723 --> 08:09.022
I was petrified.

08:09.058 --> 08:10.324
Death row.
How could you not be?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.325
It's not just that.

08:11.360 --> 08:12.726
When I got there, it hit me

08:12.761 --> 08:16.563
that if I do this, I have
a man's life in my hands.

08:16.599 --> 08:17.865
Rachel, you can handle it.

08:17.900 --> 08:19.433
I know I can.

08:19.468 --> 08:21.847
Then why do I get the feeling
that something is bothering you?

08:21.871 --> 08:23.403
Because when I got
back from there,

08:23.439 --> 08:25.417
I was so angry about what
happened to that poor man

08:25.441 --> 08:28.609
that I sat down, I started
working on this case, and I--

08:28.644 --> 08:30.277
I haven't moved since.

08:30.312 --> 08:32.346
I don't understand.
Why is that bad?

08:32.381 --> 08:34.659
Because it's the first time
since Mike left that I haven't

08:34.683 --> 08:36.350
thought about him every second.

08:38.654 --> 08:40.621
Listen to me.

08:40.655 --> 08:41.855
That's a good thing.

08:41.890 --> 08:43.690
It doesn't feel
like a good thing.

08:43.726 --> 08:45.926
Rachel, you can't live
your life on pins and needles.

08:45.961 --> 08:47.361
It's not healthy for you.

08:47.396 --> 08:49.441
It's not healthy for Mike.
It's not healthy for anyone.

08:49.465 --> 08:50.642
And forgetting about him
is healthy?

08:50.666 --> 08:51.977
Isn't that why
you took this case?

08:52.001 --> 08:53.901
To give yourself
something to focus on?

08:53.936 --> 08:55.102
Yes, but I just--

08:55.137 --> 08:56.403
Then don't fight it.

08:56.438 --> 08:58.272
If working to free
an innocent man helps you

08:58.307 --> 08:59.451
to forget about Mike
for a while,

08:59.475 --> 09:03.377
he would be the first person
to tell you to do it.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.945
And trust me,

09:04.980 --> 09:07.848
if you really
lose yourself in this,

09:07.883 --> 09:10.228
I have a feeling it's gonna seem
like a lot less than two years

09:10.252 --> 09:12.419
before he gets out.

09:22.765 --> 09:23.730
Where's Harvey?

09:23.766 --> 09:24.731
Harvey's not here.

09:24.767 --> 09:25.767
Well, get his ass in here

09:25.801 --> 09:27.212
because he made some
goddamn side deal

09:27.236 --> 09:28.747
with those traders
and I want them out.

09:28.771 --> 09:31.438
Louis, I am telling you,
now is not the time.

09:31.473 --> 09:33.273
And I am telling you
that I cannot look at

09:33.309 --> 09:36.076
their smug, stupid faces
for one more day.

09:36.111 --> 09:37.611
Maybe you don't
have to look at them.

09:37.646 --> 09:38.612
What are you talking about?

09:38.647 --> 09:39.613
Louis, did I ever tell you

09:39.648 --> 09:41.088
about my first apartment
in the city?

09:41.116 --> 09:42.082
No.

09:42.117 --> 09:44.151
I was sharing a 400
square-foot studio

09:44.186 --> 09:46.753
and it was a disaster
until we finally decided

09:46.789 --> 09:48.689
that we had to separate
our spaces for privacy.

09:48.724 --> 09:50.235
Well, this isn't
"The Brady Bunch," Donna.

09:50.259 --> 09:52.370
We can't put a masking tape line
down the center of the office.

09:52.394 --> 09:54.261
I'm not talking about
masking tape, Louis.

09:54.296 --> 09:56.363
I am talking about
hiring an architect

09:56.398 --> 09:59.466
to reconfigure the offices.

09:59.501 --> 10:01.068
You're right!

10:01.103 --> 10:02.881
We can even do a remodel, which
is what I've been wanting to do

10:02.905 --> 10:04.137
for the last five years.

10:04.173 --> 10:05.784
And the best part is,
you don't have to deal with

10:05.808 --> 10:07.574
those asshole traders
ever again.

10:07.609 --> 10:08.575
Donna, you're a genius.

10:08.610 --> 10:09.810
I know.

10:09.845 --> 10:11.256
Get me the names of
six architects before lunch.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.357
Louis, you have
your own secretary.

10:12.381 --> 10:13.347
Thanks for nothing.

10:14.383 --> 10:16.049
Why do I even?

10:20.956 --> 10:22.155
Nice of <i> you</i> to show up.

10:22.191 --> 10:24.624
Been peeling these
potatoes by myself.

10:24.660 --> 10:27.227
Sorry, I...got caught up.

10:27.262 --> 10:29.463
Speaking of which,
how'd it go with your lawyer?

10:29.498 --> 10:31.331
You gettin' out of here?

10:31.367 --> 10:32.933
What?

10:32.968 --> 10:35.702
I'm just kidding.
So what's going on?

10:35.738 --> 10:37.738
Nothing.

10:37.773 --> 10:38.972
It's not important.

10:39.008 --> 10:40.719
Your lawyer shows up
without you knowing about it

10:40.743 --> 10:41.942
and it's not important?

10:41.977 --> 10:43.221
Come on, do I look like
I was born yesterday?

10:43.245 --> 10:44.211
I just said
it is not important.

10:44.246 --> 10:45.523
And I'm sorry
I left you hanging,

10:45.547 --> 10:47.258
but you wouldn't even
have this job without me.

10:47.282 --> 10:49.349
I wouldn't even need this job
if it weren't for you.

10:49.385 --> 10:51.251
So what's your problem?

10:51.286 --> 10:53.120
I'm sorry, Kevin, I'm...

10:55.124 --> 10:57.324
I'm just not having a good day.

10:57.359 --> 10:58.325
Hey, it's okay.

10:58.360 --> 10:59.493
Don't sweat it.
All right?

10:59.528 --> 11:02.162
I mean, it's none of
my business anyway.

11:04.166 --> 11:07.701
No, actually,
it is your business.

11:07.736 --> 11:09.981
He came here to tell me that he
tried to get Gallo transferred,

11:10.005 --> 11:14.908
but...it's not gonna happen.

11:14.943 --> 11:16.187
Well, as long as
we stick together,

11:16.211 --> 11:19.579
we can deal with Gallo
anyway, right?

11:19.615 --> 11:23.417
Yeah, that's--
that's what I told Harvey.

11:23.452 --> 11:24.651
Right.

11:24.686 --> 11:25.697
Next time you talk to him,

11:25.721 --> 11:27.954
tell him I said
thanks for trying.

11:33.328 --> 11:34.294
How'd it go?

11:34.329 --> 11:35.762
He said he had
to think about it.

11:35.798 --> 11:37.431
What?
Why?

11:37.466 --> 11:39.533
'Cause he's an idiot,
that's why.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.767
So what're you gonna do?

11:40.803 --> 11:42.569
I'm gonna figure out
how to buy us some time.

11:42.604 --> 11:44.938
Well, you better do it fast
because Cahill's in your office

11:44.973 --> 11:46.640
and he wants an answer.

11:49.344 --> 11:50.510
Sean.

11:50.546 --> 11:51.778
What'd he say?

11:51.814 --> 11:53.914
Said he wants to see
the details in writing.

11:53.949 --> 11:55.026
I'm not in the mood, Harvey.

11:55.050 --> 11:56.383
And I'm not messing around.

11:56.418 --> 11:58.351
Please tell me
you're kidding me.

11:58.387 --> 11:59.397
Oh, come on, this is bullshit.

11:59.421 --> 12:00.387
You know my word is good.

12:00.422 --> 12:01.721
Yeah, and I told him that,

12:01.757 --> 12:03.735
and he doesn't want to risk
putting a target on his back

12:03.759 --> 12:05.325
and then find out
commuting his sentence

12:05.360 --> 12:06.793
really means cutting it in half.

12:06.829 --> 12:07.894
He's not risking anything.

12:07.930 --> 12:09.229
No one's gonna find out.

12:09.264 --> 12:11.631
I'm sure that's exactly
what Frank Gallo thought.

12:11.667 --> 12:14.534
So either put it in writing
or we don't have a deal.

12:16.171 --> 12:18.071
He didn't go for it, did he?

12:18.107 --> 12:19.117
What are you talking about?

12:19.141 --> 12:20.774
Mike being at risk
has nothing to do

12:20.809 --> 12:21.953
with putting anything
in writing.

12:21.977 --> 12:23.121
And you told me
he wouldn't go for it,

12:23.145 --> 12:27.447
so Harvey...
tell me the truth.

12:27.483 --> 12:29.049
All right, he said no.

12:29.084 --> 12:30.984
But Sean, I'm telling you,
he'll come around.

12:31.019 --> 12:32.097
He just needs a couple of days.

12:32.121 --> 12:33.561
Do you know how many
strings I pulled

12:33.589 --> 12:34.821
to put this thing in motion?

12:34.857 --> 12:36.857
What I know is, you wouldn't
have pulled anything

12:36.892 --> 12:38.458
if this case
wasn't huge for you.

12:38.494 --> 12:39.659
So instead of yelling at me

12:39.695 --> 12:41.072
for saying that it's gonna
take a couple days,

12:41.096 --> 12:43.263
why don't you just
give me a couple of days?

12:43.298 --> 12:44.264
Okay, Harvey.

12:44.299 --> 12:45.632
The deal's still on the table.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.712
But if I find a way to move
forward without his help,

12:47.736 --> 12:49.970
there is no deal and
he does the whole two years.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.251
Jessica.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.252
Harvey.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.587
What's going on with Mike?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.989
I gave him Cahill's offer.

13:12.025 --> 13:13.102
And he's thinking about it?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.225
I'm working on it.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.604
Well, in the meantime,
while you were out,

13:15.628 --> 13:17.361
I got a call from Nathan Byrnes.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.308
He thinks someone's trying
to take over his company.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.376
Why the hell would
he think of that?

13:20.400 --> 13:21.632
Because word on the street is,

13:21.668 --> 13:23.178
someone's selling off
a block of his stock.

13:23.202 --> 13:24.302
That doesn't make sense.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.804
We bought Sutter's shares
from him.

13:27.874 --> 13:28.839
Those goddamn traders.

13:28.875 --> 13:29.940
No way.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.186
They wouldn't do that
without telling me.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.410
They bought it in good faith.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.512
Well, they're dumping it
in bad faith.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.448
- I'll take care of it--
- No.

13:37.483 --> 13:39.850
You have your hands
full with Mike.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.018
I can handle this.

13:41.054 --> 13:43.254
Jessica, it was my idea
to involve them.

13:43.289 --> 13:44.500
I should be the one
to take care of it.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.357
I don't care whose idea
it was, Harvey.

13:46.392 --> 13:48.059
You take care of Mike.

14:01.441 --> 14:02.773
Hello?

14:02.809 --> 14:05.109
<i>You have a call from</i>
<i>Danbury Federal Prison.</i>

14:05.144 --> 14:06.610
<i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

14:06.646 --> 14:08.412
Yes, of course.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.981
<i>Mike, is everything okay?</i>

14:11.017 --> 14:12.616
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.352
I was just thinking about you.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.531
I was thinking about you too.

14:15.555 --> 14:16.721
<i>You were?</i>

14:16.756 --> 14:19.557
<i>Yes, in fact,</i>
<i>I was just in the middle</i>

14:19.592 --> 14:21.459
of a heated discussion with you

14:21.494 --> 14:24.462
about the best way to handle
a death row appeal.

14:24.497 --> 14:25.696
I don't understand.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.498
<i>I took on</i>
<i>an Innocence Project case,</i>

14:27.533 --> 14:29.778
just to have something to take
my mind off of our troubles.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.971
But I...I didn't want to
take my mind off of you.

14:34.006 --> 14:35.539
<i>So I figured I would just</i>

14:35.575 --> 14:37.641
<i>imagine we were working</i>
<i>on it together.</i>

14:37.677 --> 14:39.677
I don't know what to say.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.313
<i>Say you're in.</i>

14:42.348 --> 14:44.648
I mean, that depends on
what strategy we landed on.

14:44.684 --> 14:45.750
<i>Mike, seriously,</i>

14:45.785 --> 14:47.251
is there something wrong?

14:47.286 --> 14:50.388
<i>No, I just wanted to make</i>
<i>sure you were doing okay.</i>

14:50.423 --> 14:53.824
And that...
that we were still good.

14:53.860 --> 14:56.861
<i>Now that I have something to</i>
<i>take my mind off our situation</i>

14:56.896 --> 15:00.297
and connect me to you
at the same time,

15:00.333 --> 15:03.934
yeah, we're better than good.

15:07.840 --> 15:10.541
All right, can you do me a
favor and transfer me to Donna?

15:10.576 --> 15:11.642
Of course.

15:11.677 --> 15:12.910
Can I ask why?

15:12.945 --> 15:14.512
<i>I only get one phone call,</i>

15:14.547 --> 15:15.824
and I'm pretty sure
she had something to do

15:15.848 --> 15:19.650
with the idea of you
imagining us working together,

15:19.685 --> 15:21.419
so I just want to thank her.

15:21.454 --> 15:22.520
<i>Okay.</i>

15:22.555 --> 15:23.721
I love you.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.055
<i>I love you too.</i>

15:29.128 --> 15:30.261
Hello?

15:30.296 --> 15:31.996
<i>Donna, I have Mike</i>
<i>on the phone.</i>

15:32.031 --> 15:34.231
Put him through.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.267
Hello?
<i>Donna.</i>

15:35.301 --> 15:36.700
If Harvey's there,
do me a favor--

15:36.736 --> 15:38.580
keep your voice down,
and don't tell him it's me.

15:38.604 --> 15:39.637
Mike, what's going on?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.505
I'm not taking the deal,
Donna.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.506
Are you crazy?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.974
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

15:44.010 --> 15:45.721
What's not simple about it?
Harvey said that if you--

15:45.745 --> 15:46.944
<i>I don't care</i>
<i>what Harvey said.</i>

15:46.979 --> 15:48.279
Because what he didn't say

15:48.314 --> 15:50.448
is that if I do what he wants
and someone finds out,

15:50.483 --> 15:51.960
then I may never get back
to Rachel at all.

15:51.984 --> 15:53.462
<i>Harvey would never</i>
<i>let them find out--</i>

15:53.486 --> 15:55.130
Donna, look, I called you
so that I didn't want to have

15:55.154 --> 15:56.120
this argument with him.

15:56.155 --> 15:58.022
Now, I don't have much time.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.524
Are you gonna do this for me
or not?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.026
I'll tell him.

16:02.061 --> 16:03.839
<i>Then I also need you to</i>
<i>tell him something else for me.</i>

16:03.863 --> 16:06.664
If he comes here to try
to change my mind,

16:06.699 --> 16:08.933
I'm not gonna see him.

16:15.041 --> 16:16.507
You mind telling me
who the hell said

16:16.542 --> 16:19.043
you can dump Nathan Byrnes'
stock without talking to us?

16:19.078 --> 16:20.255
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.378
Who's Nathan Byrnes?

16:21.414 --> 16:23.113
CEO of Exodyne.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.315
Oh, that Nathan Byrnes.

16:24.350 --> 16:26.283
In that case,<i> I</i> said
I could sell that stock

16:26.319 --> 16:27.551
because I own it.

16:27.587 --> 16:31.422
Just like I own this one
and this one and this one.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.457
Hey, look at that,
my Neubacher Capital position's

16:33.493 --> 16:34.925
going through the roof.

16:34.961 --> 16:36.705
That's not the deal you made
with Harvey and you know it.

16:36.729 --> 16:38.796
Welcome to the big,
bad world of Wall Street.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.809
Now, do you want something
or can I get back to work?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.233
Oh, I want something.

16:42.268 --> 16:44.379
You're going to unwind that sale
and buy those shares back.

16:44.403 --> 16:46.237
At a premium?
Not gonna happen.

16:46.272 --> 16:47.238
I'm your landlord.

16:47.273 --> 16:48.417
And the fact
you had to lease to me

16:48.441 --> 16:50.018
means you don't have
much of an operation.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.642
You listen to me,
you little pissant.

16:51.677 --> 16:52.821
You don't know who
you're messing with.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.311
Then why don't I find out?

16:54.347 --> 16:55.779
Over dinner?

16:55.815 --> 16:57.414
You've got to be kidding me.

16:57.450 --> 16:59.350
You want me to have
dinner with you

16:59.385 --> 17:01.185
in exchange for
backing off that trade?

17:01.220 --> 17:03.087
I think of it as you get
to have dinner with me

17:03.122 --> 17:05.990
and I choose to back off that
trade 'cause I am a standup guy.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.559
Well, let me let you in on
a little something there, Stu.

17:08.594 --> 17:11.662
I don't share dinner staring
down the barrel of a shotgun.

17:11.696 --> 17:14.665
So why don't you unwind that
trade and then ask me out?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.467
And then we'll see
if you're as charming

17:16.502 --> 17:17.613
as you like to think you are.

17:17.637 --> 17:18.714
You know what?
I am charming.

17:18.738 --> 17:19.703
But I'm not an idiot.

17:19.739 --> 17:20.883
And I'm not unwinding my trade

17:20.906 --> 17:23.540
without getting
something in return.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.400
Harvey, I need to talk
to you about something

17:38.424 --> 17:39.390
and you're not going to like it.

17:39.425 --> 17:40.524
About what?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.526
That was Mike
on the phone before.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.661
Why didn't you get me?

17:43.696 --> 17:45.095
He's not taking the deal,
Harvey.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.497
The hell he isn't.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.966
Where are you going?

17:49.001 --> 17:50.100
To that prison.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.869
Harvey, the reason
he called me and not you

17:51.904 --> 17:53.982
is because he knew you wouldn't
take no for an answer.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.172
And I'm not going to.

17:55.207 --> 17:56.907
Which is why he said
if you show up there,

17:56.943 --> 17:58.776
he's not gonna leave his cell.

17:58.811 --> 17:59.811
Then get me Rachel.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.046
No, no, Harvey,
you cannot tell her.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.113
Like hell I can't.

18:03.149 --> 18:04.693
She's the only one
who can convince him.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.684
If you tell her that
Mike's not taking a deal

18:06.719 --> 18:08.519
that can get him out,
it'll tear her apart.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.454
And if I don't tell her,
he's gonna be in there

18:10.489 --> 18:11.455
for two more years.

18:11.490 --> 18:12.456
Is that what she wants?

18:12.491 --> 18:13.457
That's between them.

18:13.492 --> 18:14.458
That's why I want to tell her.

18:14.493 --> 18:15.459
She'll make it between them.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.161
Harvey.

18:17.196 --> 18:19.396
God damn it, he plays checkers
with this guy

18:19.432 --> 18:20.509
and thinks he owes him his life.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.232
No, that's not fair
and you know it,

18:22.268 --> 18:25.069
because Mike's loyalty is
the reason you're not in prison.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.807
That's what's killing me,
Donna, don't you understand?

18:29.842 --> 18:35.179
He's in there instead of me
with a guy I put away,

18:35.214 --> 18:37.748
and I can't just sit here
doing nothing

18:37.783 --> 18:39.984
when he has a chance to get out.

18:40.019 --> 18:42.519
Which is why you have to
think of something else.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.154
Because if you tell
Rachel about this,

18:44.190 --> 18:47.491
the life that's waiting
for Mike when he gets out...

18:47.526 --> 18:49.593
it isn't going to be there.

18:57.903 --> 19:00.504
Harvey. I'm surprised
to see you here so soon.

19:00.539 --> 19:02.084
I didn't think
you'd turn him this fast.

19:02.108 --> 19:03.073
I need more time.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.508
I don't think you understand.

19:04.543 --> 19:06.421
I'm being pressured to move
to another investigation.

19:06.445 --> 19:09.179
You've got 24 hours to change
his mind or this thing is done.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.726
Then I need you to
do something for me.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.893
I am doing something for you.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.283
I'm getting Mike out of prison.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.352
Well, you need to do
something else for me

19:15.388 --> 19:17.721
or that's never gonna happen.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.523
What are you talking about?

19:19.558 --> 19:21.258
I need you to get
into a room with him

19:21.293 --> 19:23.494
because he won't listen
to what I have to say.

19:23.529 --> 19:25.040
What exactly do you
want me to tell him

19:25.064 --> 19:26.196
that you haven't already?

19:26.232 --> 19:27.665
Sean, Mike's a bleeding heart.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.566
You need to make the case
directly to him.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.202
He needs to see the victims of
whatever the hell this guy did.

19:32.238 --> 19:33.604
That's a swell idea, Harvey,

19:33.639 --> 19:35.673
but if I go into that prison
and someone sees me,

19:35.708 --> 19:37.041
not only are we dead
in the water,

19:37.076 --> 19:38.642
but Mike's life
isn't worth shit.

19:38.678 --> 19:39.755
You think I don't know that?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.289
What the hell do you think
I'm doing here?

19:41.313 --> 19:42.391
What are you talking about?

19:42.415 --> 19:43.380
I have a plan.

19:43.416 --> 19:44.648
But you're not gonna like it.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.716
Why not?

19:45.751 --> 19:47.229
Because I need you
to pull another string,

19:47.253 --> 19:49.386
and I need you to do it
before Frank Gallo tries

19:49.422 --> 19:51.155
something else with Mike.

19:59.665 --> 20:00.931
All right, fake lawyer.

20:00.966 --> 20:04.068
Let's see what you got.

20:04.103 --> 20:05.703
You're gonna let me
look into it for you?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.404
Look into it?
Shit.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.351
You're gonna get me out of here
like you promised.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.340
I never promised.

20:10.376 --> 20:11.520
I said there was
an excellent chance

20:11.544 --> 20:13.410
that you could get--
Six weeks, brother.

20:13.446 --> 20:16.413
I'll be counting the days.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.415
I'll file the motion
first thing in the morning.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.416
There you go.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.418
That's what I'm talking about.

20:21.454 --> 20:24.254
And if I find out you're
screwing me on any level,

20:24.290 --> 20:27.124
you better hole up in some
dark corner of this prison,

20:27.159 --> 20:30.394
pray to God
I don't find your ass.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.269
What was that all about?

20:40.806 --> 20:44.108
Looks like he took me up
on my offer after all.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.605
God damn it, Gretchen,
where the hell is she?

20:58.629 --> 20:59.762
Where the hell is who?

20:59.797 --> 21:01.375
That architect
you were supposed to call.

21:01.399 --> 21:03.439
She's not supposed to be here
for another half hour.

21:03.467 --> 21:05.067
And if I want
someone's business,

21:05.102 --> 21:07.203
I show up a half-hour
early at the latest.

21:07.238 --> 21:08.982
And what exactly are
you looking to have me do

21:09.006 --> 21:10.139
about your little conundrum?

21:10.174 --> 21:11.607
I want you to give her a call

21:11.642 --> 21:13.854
and tell her if she doesn't have
the goddamn common courtesy

21:13.878 --> 21:15.989
to show up early, then she might
as well not show up at all.

21:16.013 --> 21:17.880
- Mr. Litt.
- I--

21:17.915 --> 21:19.348
Y-yes?

21:19.383 --> 21:20.549
I'm Tara Messer.

21:20.585 --> 21:22.117
I'm here to discuss
your remodel needs.

21:22.153 --> 21:23.519
My needs?

21:23.554 --> 21:26.088
Well, I'm sorry, Ms.
Was-Going-to-Be-Our-Architect.

21:26.123 --> 21:27.301
We no longer need your service.

21:27.325 --> 21:28.457
Gretchen, calm down.

21:28.492 --> 21:30.292
You are overreacting
like a crazy woman.

21:30.328 --> 21:31.360
You're hired.

21:31.395 --> 21:32.395
I am?

21:32.430 --> 21:33.929
Oh, yeah.
You're right for the job.

21:33.965 --> 21:34.930
I can feel it.

21:34.966 --> 21:36.765
Oh, you can feel something,
all right.

21:36.801 --> 21:38.841
Then why don't we start
with what you're looking for

21:38.869 --> 21:40.903
in the space?

21:40.938 --> 21:42.638
Oh.
Space.

21:42.673 --> 21:44.440
Right, the space.
Exactly.

21:44.475 --> 21:47.209
What I'm looking for are clear
yet unobtrusive boundaries

21:47.245 --> 21:48.744
between our offices
and the tenants'.

21:48.779 --> 21:51.513
But it needs to be
elegant and organic

21:51.549 --> 21:53.249
or we might as well
not do it at all.

21:53.284 --> 21:54.483
I understand.

21:54.518 --> 21:58.120
Like the perfect aria
leading seamlessly

21:58.155 --> 22:00.189
to its inevitable cadenza.

22:00.224 --> 22:01.224
You're an opera lover?

22:01.259 --> 22:02.391
Second only to the ballet.

22:02.426 --> 22:03.993
Then I suggest we start
with a marriage.

22:04.028 --> 22:05.861
I mean a tour.

22:15.106 --> 22:16.272
Excuse me, Professor Dunbar.

22:16.307 --> 22:17.406
Do you have a moment?

22:17.441 --> 22:18.974
This is the faculty lounge,
Ms. Zane.

22:19.010 --> 22:20.020
You're not supposed
to be in here.

22:20.044 --> 22:21.543
I understand that,
and I'm sorry.

22:21.579 --> 22:25.047
It's just this is important
and you weren't in your office.

22:25.082 --> 22:26.148
What can I do for you?

22:26.183 --> 22:28.417
I met with
Leonard Bailey yesterday.

22:28.452 --> 22:29.796
He's the inmate on death--
I know who he is.

22:29.820 --> 22:31.720
Is there a problem?
Yes, there is.

22:31.756 --> 22:35.057
He's rotting on death row for
a crime that he didn't commit.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.159
So you met with him
for ten minutes

22:37.194 --> 22:38.472
and you're ready to release him?

22:38.496 --> 22:39.628
No, what I'm saying is--

22:39.664 --> 22:41.264
You're a second-year
law student, Rachel.

22:41.299 --> 22:42.542
I asked you to be a part of this

22:42.566 --> 22:43.944
because you're one of
my brightest students,

22:43.968 --> 22:45.301
but I also asked
you in particular

22:45.336 --> 22:48.370
because I didn't think
you'd be so naive.

22:48.406 --> 22:49.638
Excuse me?

22:49.674 --> 22:51.473
Your job wasn't to
talk to Mr. Bailey once

22:51.509 --> 22:53.609
and, after being moved
by his tale of woe,

22:53.644 --> 22:55.577
tell me to jump him
to the top of the pile.

22:55.613 --> 22:57.846
It was to assess his case
and present evidence.

22:57.882 --> 22:59.715
And that's exactly
what I'm doing here.

22:59.750 --> 23:01.016
I just left two boxes

23:01.052 --> 23:04.286
of textbook prosecutorial
misconduct with your secretary.

23:04.322 --> 23:06.588
You found all of that
since yesterday?

23:06.624 --> 23:09.491
Yes, because while I may only
be a second-year law student,

23:09.527 --> 23:11.060
I have been
a practicing paralegal

23:11.095 --> 23:14.163
for the past eight years.

23:14.198 --> 23:16.532
Looks like I have
some reading to do.

23:18.035 --> 23:19.568
I'm sorry for
interrupting your day.

23:19.603 --> 23:21.570
Good afternoon, Ms. Zane.

23:21.605 --> 23:24.139
Good afternoon, Professor.

23:28.145 --> 23:29.912
And then we use
the glass motif

23:29.947 --> 23:31.947
you already have
to partition their space

23:31.982 --> 23:35.284
from yours starting at
that wall over there.

23:35.319 --> 23:37.653
And no one ever knows
they're two separate entities.

23:37.688 --> 23:39.988
And if we use
the frosted glass,

23:40.024 --> 23:42.257
you'll never even have to
lay eyes on them.

23:42.293 --> 23:44.126
Well, there's
just one more thing.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.794
You want to know
if I can design another

23:45.830 --> 23:47.129
bullpen area for your side.

23:47.164 --> 23:48.975
After all, it's the heart
and soul of the space.

23:48.999 --> 23:50.032
You get that?

23:50.067 --> 23:52.067
It's my job to get that.

23:52.103 --> 23:53.369
I don't understand.

23:53.404 --> 23:56.438
To me, architecture isn't
just about design.

23:56.474 --> 24:00.209
It's--it's about connecting with
my clients on an intimate level.

24:00.244 --> 24:02.144
Well, you're very good at it.

24:02.179 --> 24:04.747
And you know, it's too bad you
already sublet to someone else.

24:04.782 --> 24:06.382
We're looking to
expand ourselves.

24:06.417 --> 24:07.950
This space would
have been perfect.

24:07.985 --> 24:08.951
Are you serious?

24:08.986 --> 24:09.952
Yeah.

24:09.987 --> 24:11.153
In fact, it's so perfect,

24:11.188 --> 24:13.589
I would have made you
an offer on the spot.

24:13.624 --> 24:17.359
Anyway, I'll have some plans
drawn up as soon as I can.

24:27.371 --> 24:28.582
We need to get rid
of those traders.

24:28.606 --> 24:29.571
Excuse me?

24:29.607 --> 24:30.650
I don't care what kind of deal

24:30.674 --> 24:31.640
you and Harvey cut with them.

24:31.675 --> 24:32.641
We need to get rid of them

24:32.676 --> 24:33.676
and we need to do it now.

24:33.711 --> 24:35.088
Well, Louis,
I'm not going to do that

24:35.112 --> 24:36.612
because whoever
we replace them with,

24:36.647 --> 24:38.547
this conversation is just
going to happen again.

24:38.582 --> 24:40.749
Because we both know
that you're out of your mind.

24:40.785 --> 24:42.017
It's not gonna happen again

24:42.052 --> 24:44.264
because in this particular case,
I am not out of my mind.

24:44.288 --> 24:45.465
Why do you want me to do this?

24:45.489 --> 24:47.389
Because I'm in love
with an architect.

24:47.425 --> 24:48.490
Let me get this straight.

24:48.526 --> 24:50.003
You want me to further
antagonize people

24:50.027 --> 24:51.104
that I'm already fighting with

24:51.128 --> 24:52.094
because you don't have the balls

24:52.129 --> 24:53.173
to ask a woman out on a date?

24:53.197 --> 24:54.163
That's one way
of looking at it.

24:54.198 --> 24:55.164
No, there's another way.

24:55.199 --> 24:56.865
The answer is no.
Okay, fine.

24:56.901 --> 24:58.278
I'll just stick to
the original plan

24:58.302 --> 24:59.780
of having her completely
redesign our space,

24:59.804 --> 25:01.047
and I'll just make sure
it takes long enough

25:01.071 --> 25:02.382
for her to fall madly
in love with me,

25:02.406 --> 25:04.050
and it shouldn't take more
than two or three years.

25:04.074 --> 25:07.042
Louis, I want you to
look at me when I say this.

25:07.077 --> 25:09.711
If you hire this woman
to do anything relating

25:09.747 --> 25:11.180
to this firm's space,

25:11.215 --> 25:13.682
I will personally throw you
off the roof this building.

25:13.717 --> 25:15.284
Is that clear?

25:15.319 --> 25:16.285
So you'll think about it?

25:16.320 --> 25:19.188
Get out.

25:23.194 --> 25:25.694
Yo.
Ahnold.

25:25.729 --> 25:27.362
Come on.
Let's see what you got.

25:27.398 --> 25:29.465
I didn't know you played.

25:29.500 --> 25:30.899
Played?
Shit.

25:30.935 --> 25:34.570
I set the P.S. 092
single-game scoring record.

25:34.605 --> 25:37.473
P.S. 092 is an elementary
school, my friend.

25:37.508 --> 25:40.375
Yeah, sixth grade.
I dominated.

25:40.411 --> 25:43.011
Heard you had to file that
motion for Gallo's parole.

25:43.047 --> 25:44.746
- I did.
- Already?

25:44.782 --> 25:46.415
It was an 18-page
sentencing amendment.

25:46.450 --> 25:47.716
I could do that in my sleep.

25:47.751 --> 25:49.518
I should get you to
do some work for me.

25:49.553 --> 25:51.286
Why?
You need some?

25:51.322 --> 25:53.322
No, but if I did,
I'd probably get myself a lawyer

25:53.357 --> 25:54.556
who didn't sleep in a prison.

25:57.795 --> 25:58.760
You all right?

25:59.864 --> 26:01.630
I don't--I don't know.

26:01.665 --> 26:02.742
What do you mean,
you don't know?

26:02.766 --> 26:04.600
What is it, your stomach?

26:04.635 --> 26:05.745
Oh, my God,
something's not right.

26:05.769 --> 26:06.735
Take a deep breath.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.136
Put your head down.

26:08.172 --> 26:10.072
Oh, God, I can't--
that's not gonna do anything.

26:10.107 --> 26:11.273
I think...

26:11.308 --> 26:12.519
Oh, my God, I think somebody

26:12.543 --> 26:13.509
did something to me.

26:13.544 --> 26:14.910
Hey, can I get
some help over here?

26:14.945 --> 26:15.911
Guard!

26:15.946 --> 26:17.613
Mike, talk to me.

26:17.648 --> 26:19.114
It's Gallo.

26:19.149 --> 26:20.983
Yeah, he must've put
something in my--

26:21.018 --> 26:23.118
Somebody do something!
Guard!

26:23.153 --> 26:24.319
Call Harvey.

26:24.355 --> 26:25.854
Guard!

26:25.890 --> 26:27.723
Mike.
Mike!

26:40.160 --> 26:41.426
Where is he?

26:41.461 --> 26:43.306
If I knew who you were
talking about, maybe I could--

26:43.330 --> 26:44.896
Mike Ross.
I need to see him right now.

26:44.931 --> 26:46.030
And who are you?

26:46.066 --> 26:48.433
Harvey Specter.
I'm his attorney.

26:51.705 --> 26:54.639
Mr. Ross is in the infirmary,
but you can't see him in there.

26:54.674 --> 26:56.875
Then get me the warden.

26:59.546 --> 27:01.679
I don't appreciate being
pushed around, Mr. Specter.

27:01.715 --> 27:02.981
I don't care.

27:03.016 --> 27:04.927
I want everyone to know
what happened here today.

27:04.951 --> 27:06.384
They saw what happened.

27:06.419 --> 27:10.088
Yeah, there's a difference
between seeing and knowing.

27:10.123 --> 27:11.389
You Kevin Miller?

27:11.424 --> 27:12.390
Who are you?

27:12.425 --> 27:13.391
Harvey Specter.

27:13.426 --> 27:14.392
I'm Mike Ross's lawyer.

27:14.427 --> 27:15.605
Look, I already
told the warden

27:15.629 --> 27:16.672
I didn't see anyone
touch his food.

27:16.696 --> 27:18.796
Did you see Frank Gallo
with him?

27:20.033 --> 27:21.132
Did you or didn't you?

27:21.168 --> 27:22.278
Are you trying to
get me killed, man?

27:22.302 --> 27:24.602
Did he touch his food or not?

27:24.638 --> 27:27.172
Yeah, he did,
last night at dinner.

27:27.207 --> 27:28.773
But Mike offered
to get Gallo parole

27:28.808 --> 27:30.853
and Gallo took him up on it,
so why would he poison him?

27:30.877 --> 27:33.178
Because he didn't really
take Mike up on that offer.

27:33.213 --> 27:35.480
He just did it
to get close to him.

27:35.515 --> 27:37.326
Or he did it to give Mike
a taste of what happens

27:37.350 --> 27:38.750
if he doesn't come through.

27:38.785 --> 27:41.386
Either way, you stay the hell
away from that son of a bitch.

27:41.421 --> 27:43.254
All right, that's enough.
Let's go.

27:45.292 --> 27:46.658
Hey, counselor!

27:46.693 --> 27:49.093
I heard your boy had a little
tummy ache out in the yard.

27:49.129 --> 27:50.094
You piece of shit.

27:50.130 --> 27:51.429
You goddamn poisoned him.

27:51.464 --> 27:52.430
Guards, get him out of here.

27:52.465 --> 27:53.765
I didn't do shit.

27:53.800 --> 27:55.311
Why don't you come over here
and say that to my face?

27:55.335 --> 27:56.968
- You think I won't?
- God damn it.

27:57.003 --> 27:59.103
I said get him back to his cell!

27:59.139 --> 28:00.538
Hey, this wasn't part
of the deal.

28:00.574 --> 28:02.140
We talked about you
seeing his roommate,

28:02.175 --> 28:03.541
not rushing Frank Gallo.

28:03.577 --> 28:06.578
Yeah, well, my guy's lying
unconscious in the infirmary.

28:06.613 --> 28:08.913
So sue me.

28:14.588 --> 28:16.265
How did you know Gallo
would take the bait?

28:16.289 --> 28:18.957
Because he's an animal, and
animals always take the bait.

28:18.992 --> 28:22.060
Well, I'll give you credit for
knowing how it would go down.

28:22.095 --> 28:23.228
I don't need credit.

28:23.263 --> 28:25.029
I need to know
where Mike Ross is.

28:25.065 --> 28:26.831
Where I was instructed
to put him.

28:26.866 --> 28:28.144
Let me tell you something,
Mr. Specter,

28:28.168 --> 28:29.467
I don't know you.

28:29.502 --> 28:30.846
So in case you're thinking
of trying anything,

28:30.870 --> 28:32.148
that kid has a monitor
on his leg,

28:32.172 --> 28:34.205
and if it goes dark
for even one second,

28:34.241 --> 28:36.674
I'm gonna make sure that you
end up in a cell here with him.

28:36.710 --> 28:38.176
It's not gonna go dark,

28:38.211 --> 28:40.178
and he'll be back here
when I said he would.

28:40.213 --> 28:41.613
Then after that,
I'm gonna make sure

28:41.648 --> 28:44.983
he gets out of here.
For good.

29:12.245 --> 29:14.245
How you feeling?

29:19.853 --> 29:22.186
What's going on?

29:22.222 --> 29:23.621
Where am I?

29:23.657 --> 29:24.822
You're in the back of my car.

29:24.858 --> 29:27.925
You were drugged.

29:27.961 --> 29:28.993
By Gallo.

29:29.029 --> 29:31.629
By me.

29:31.665 --> 29:32.730
What?

29:32.766 --> 29:34.666
Cahill got the warden
and the prison doctor

29:34.701 --> 29:36.034
to put something in your food.

29:36.069 --> 29:37.880
They're the only ones
who know what's going on.

29:37.904 --> 29:39.337
What the hell are
you talking about?

29:39.372 --> 29:41.572
We needed to change your mind
about taking this deal,

29:41.608 --> 29:43.541
and we couldn't do it
as long as you're in there.

29:43.576 --> 29:44.742
Jesus Christ.

29:44.778 --> 29:46.678
So you drugged me?

29:46.713 --> 29:48.913
We needed a cover for why
you're not in your cell,

29:48.948 --> 29:50.226
and this was
the only way to do it.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.516
Are you insane?

29:51.551 --> 29:52.595
You broke me out of prison?

29:52.619 --> 29:54.018
I didn't break
you out of anywhere.

29:54.054 --> 29:55.553
Cahill sanctioned it.

29:55.588 --> 29:58.423
And if anyone's insane,
it's you, 'cause you're the one

29:58.458 --> 30:00.525
turning down a chance
to get out of that place.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.538
But we don't have time
to talk about that right now.

30:02.562 --> 30:03.761
Cahill's waiting for us.

30:03.797 --> 30:04.874
You got me out to see Cahill?

30:04.898 --> 30:06.197
I said he's waiting.

30:06.232 --> 30:07.965
I didn't say that's where
I'm taking you.

30:08.001 --> 30:10.968
Well, then where the hell
are you taking me?

30:25.118 --> 30:27.151
You think me spending
a couple of hours with Rachel

30:27.187 --> 30:28.786
is gonna change my mind?

30:28.822 --> 30:32.423
If it doesn't, there's
something wrong with you.

30:32.459 --> 30:34.659
So, you gonna yell at me?

30:34.694 --> 30:36.372
Or you gonna take the only
chance you're gonna get

30:36.396 --> 30:37.740
to be alone with
the woman you love

30:37.764 --> 30:40.331
for the next two years?

30:40.367 --> 30:42.066
Please tell me that
you did not tell her

30:42.102 --> 30:43.234
about Cahill's offer.

30:43.269 --> 30:45.403
Oh, I wanted to.

30:45.438 --> 30:49.140
But you have Donna to thank
for the fact that I didn't.

30:52.912 --> 30:57.548
What am I supposed to tell
Rachel about why I'm here?

30:57.584 --> 30:59.951
If it were me,
I'd tell her the truth.

30:59.986 --> 31:03.788
Now, since you don't
want to do that,

31:03.823 --> 31:07.091
you're lucky I came up
with something else.

31:11.564 --> 31:14.265
Wait till it hits 30
and then sell.

31:15.535 --> 31:17.001
Well, look who it is.

31:17.036 --> 31:18.636
You change your mind
about my offer?

31:18.671 --> 31:20.471
I'm not there just yet.

31:20.507 --> 31:22.306
But I did come to apologize.

31:22.342 --> 31:24.208
I didn't mean to be
so combative before.

31:24.244 --> 31:27.011
You're a proud woman.
I understand. Bygones.

31:27.046 --> 31:29.614
You know, your operation
here is kind of impressive.

31:29.649 --> 31:31.215
Mind if I look at one?

31:31.251 --> 31:32.795
You can take a look at
anything of mine you want.

31:36.022 --> 31:37.088
Huh.

31:37.123 --> 31:40.525
Now, what does
that line right there mean?

31:40.560 --> 31:42.438
What the hell, that's my
Neubacher Capital position.

31:42.462 --> 31:43.939
Well, it seems to be
falling very quickly.

31:43.963 --> 31:46.464
Is that a good thing?

31:46.499 --> 31:47.465
You did this.

31:47.500 --> 31:48.866
I'm not sure what you mean.

31:48.902 --> 31:49.867
All I did this afternoon

31:49.903 --> 31:51.636
was call my friend
at Jacobson Kearney

31:51.671 --> 31:53.070
and have them issue
a press release

31:53.106 --> 31:55.139
about their client's
merger negotiations.

31:55.175 --> 31:56.819
I mean, how was I supposed
to know that it would make

31:56.843 --> 31:59.343
your Neubacher position
fall through the floor?

31:59.379 --> 32:01.145
You used the information
I gave you yesterday

32:01.181 --> 32:03.247
about my holdings,
that's how.

32:03.283 --> 32:04.894
That's inside information,
and I can prove it.

32:04.918 --> 32:06.217
No, it could have been,

32:06.252 --> 32:08.719
if your attorney hadn't filed
your position with the SEC

32:08.755 --> 32:10.922
ten days earlier than he had to.

32:10.957 --> 32:12.056
I'm not gonna forget this.

32:12.091 --> 32:13.891
Good, because my
operation's been around

32:13.927 --> 32:15.104
a hell of a lot
longer than yours,

32:15.128 --> 32:18.496
and we can be friends
or we can be enemies.

32:18.531 --> 32:19.764
But you mess with me again

32:19.799 --> 32:22.366
and I'll not only kick you
out of these offices,

32:22.402 --> 32:25.570
I'll put you in the ground.

32:37.083 --> 32:38.749
Rachel.

32:47.093 --> 32:48.693
How?

32:48.728 --> 32:50.995
Harvey.

32:51.030 --> 32:53.598
Oh.
I don't understand.

32:53.633 --> 32:55.299
I know you know
about Frank Gallo.

32:55.335 --> 32:56.934
But what you don't know

32:56.970 --> 33:00.104
is that they put me in solitary
confinement for 36 hours.

33:00.139 --> 33:01.572
- Oh, my God.
- It's okay.

33:01.608 --> 33:03.241
I was safe.

33:03.276 --> 33:04.653
Then Harvey made them
watch the video,

33:04.677 --> 33:06.777
which showed that I was
only defending myself.

33:06.813 --> 33:08.424
Turns out they were
more than happy to trade

33:08.448 --> 33:13.117
six hours and an ankle bracelet
to avoid a lawsuit.

33:14.153 --> 33:16.754
We only have six hours?

33:16.789 --> 33:20.791
Yeah, and I don't want to
waste any of it.

33:44.650 --> 33:45.816
Mr. Litt,
what are you--

33:45.850 --> 33:48.317
Oh, please, call me Louis.

33:48.353 --> 33:49.719
What can I do for you, Louis?

33:49.754 --> 33:51.354
Tara, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

33:51.389 --> 33:52.355
We're not gonna be
moving forward

33:52.390 --> 33:55.158
with the renovations after all.

33:55.193 --> 33:56.292
I'm sorry to hear that.

33:56.327 --> 33:58.027
No, it has nothing
to do with you.

33:58.062 --> 34:00.096
And of course I will pay you
out of my own pocket

34:00.131 --> 34:01.575
for any of the work
you've already done.

34:01.599 --> 34:02.565
That won't be necessary.

34:02.600 --> 34:06.135
Please, Tara, I insist.

34:06.171 --> 34:07.904
In that case,
I might as well at least

34:07.939 --> 34:10.072
show you what I had in mind.

34:12.210 --> 34:15.411
As you can see,
these are just rough drawings.

34:15.446 --> 34:16.913
Not to me.

34:16.947 --> 34:20.616
Here's the frosted glass wall
curving in an elegant "S"

34:20.652 --> 34:22.685
that separates the space.

34:22.719 --> 34:23.820
It's beautiful.

34:23.855 --> 34:26.355
That's not even
the best part.

34:26.391 --> 34:28.991
Because I know how important
the new bullpen is to you,

34:29.027 --> 34:32.161
I modeled it after the
Kimmel Center in Philadelphia,

34:32.197 --> 34:33.696
and I enclosed
the entire space--

34:33.731 --> 34:35.598
In mahogany.

34:36.868 --> 34:38.701
It would have been exquisite.

34:38.735 --> 34:41.170
But some things
weren't meant to be.

34:42.774 --> 34:45.107
Yeah.

34:45.143 --> 34:46.987
How would you feel about
renovating my summer house

34:47.011 --> 34:47.976
in the Hamptons?

34:48.012 --> 34:49.178
I appreciate the thought,

34:49.214 --> 34:50.623
Louis, but I don't do
residential work.

34:50.648 --> 34:53.282
It's not residential.
I use it as a home office.

34:53.318 --> 34:54.449
But it would be so small.

34:54.485 --> 34:55.529
Oh, no, I want
the entire house to be

34:55.553 --> 34:58.287
a satellite division
of the firm.

34:58.323 --> 35:00.223
Are you sure?

35:00.258 --> 35:03.125
I've never been as sure
of anything in my entire life.

35:05.230 --> 35:08.297
Then I look forward to
working with you, Louis.

35:14.505 --> 35:15.671
Sean, what can I do for you?

35:15.707 --> 35:17.373
- Where the hell are they?
- What?

35:17.408 --> 35:19.386
I've been sitting in my office
for two hours waiting for them.

35:19.410 --> 35:20.810
Where the hell are they?

35:20.845 --> 35:22.223
I don't know.
Maybe they're caught in traffic.

35:22.247 --> 35:23.657
Listen to me,
I can contact the prison

35:23.681 --> 35:25.248
and find out exactly
where they are.

35:25.283 --> 35:27.149
But I do that,
it starts a tornado of shit

35:27.185 --> 35:28.751
with your boss in the eye
of the storm.

35:28.786 --> 35:32.121
So you're gonna tell me right
now what the hell they're up to.

35:32.156 --> 35:33.901
He's waiting for Mike
outside of his apartment.

35:33.925 --> 35:35.224
Waiting for him to do what?

35:35.260 --> 35:36.737
- He's with Rachel.
- You got to be kidding me.

35:36.761 --> 35:38.694
I didn't pull in every
favor I have so Mike Ross

35:38.730 --> 35:39.740
could have some conjugal visit.

35:39.764 --> 35:41.397
No, you pulled in
every favor you had

35:41.432 --> 35:43.833
so that Harvey could convince
Mike to do what you wanted

35:43.868 --> 35:45.434
and this is gonna
make that happen.

35:45.470 --> 35:46.602
By getting him laid?

35:46.638 --> 35:48.371
By reminding him of
what he's missing out on

35:48.406 --> 35:49.572
if he doesn't take your deal.

35:49.607 --> 35:51.908
That wasn't the plan.

35:51.943 --> 35:52.909
Where are you going?

35:52.944 --> 35:53.910
I'm gonna go down there and do

35:53.945 --> 35:55.122
what we said we were gonna do.

35:55.146 --> 35:56.590
I'm gonna show Mike
the innocent people

35:56.614 --> 35:58.092
that lost everything
because of that bastard.

35:58.116 --> 36:00.182
Sean, please,
if you do that,

36:00.218 --> 36:01.629
Rachel will find out
about everything

36:01.653 --> 36:03.319
and that can't happen.
Why not?

36:03.354 --> 36:04.987
Because Mike chose prison
over her once,

36:05.023 --> 36:06.567
and if he does it again,
she'll never forgive him.

36:06.591 --> 36:08.424
Mike's problem.
Not mine.

36:08.459 --> 36:10.593
No, that's Harvey's problem.

36:10.628 --> 36:12.128
He promised Mike
he wouldn't tell her,

36:12.163 --> 36:14.030
and Harvey's a man of his word.

36:14.065 --> 36:16.243
If he were a man of his word,
he would be here right now.

36:16.267 --> 36:17.500
So what are you gonna do?

36:17.535 --> 36:18.646
I'm gonna do what
should've been done

36:18.670 --> 36:19.769
in the first place.

36:19.804 --> 36:20.770
I'm gonna tell Mike's fiancée

36:20.805 --> 36:21.771
that he has a chance to get out

36:21.806 --> 36:23.806
but he doesn't want to take it.

36:25.376 --> 36:28.177
You want to tell me
what that was all about?

36:30.148 --> 36:31.781
Harvey and Cahill
got Mike out of prison

36:31.816 --> 36:34.050
to convince him
to take the deal,

36:34.085 --> 36:37.019
and Harvey brought Mike
to Rachel instead of to Sean.

36:37.055 --> 36:38.921
He broke Mike out of prison?

36:38.957 --> 36:40.022
Is he crazy?

36:40.058 --> 36:41.691
It sounded crazy
to me at first too,

36:41.726 --> 36:44.004
but Harvey's living with the
guilt of putting Mike in there

36:44.028 --> 36:47.563
and Cahill was willing to do it,
so can you blame him?

36:47.598 --> 36:50.499
No.
I can't.

36:51.703 --> 36:54.270
But I want to know how
this whole thing shakes out.

36:54.305 --> 36:56.906
And I want to know tonight.

37:11.289 --> 37:12.555
- Shh.
- What time is it?

37:12.590 --> 37:14.724
We still have time.

37:14.759 --> 37:17.126
Oh, my God.

37:17.161 --> 37:19.362
I fell asleep.

37:19.397 --> 37:21.163
You did.

37:21.199 --> 37:23.699
Why didn't you wake me?

37:23.735 --> 37:25.668
Because you looked
so peaceful.

37:25.703 --> 37:27.403
Rachel, I don't want us
to waste--

37:27.438 --> 37:29.005
We're not wasting anything.

37:29.040 --> 37:31.907
Mike, I don't know how well
you sleep in there,

37:31.943 --> 37:35.478
so to be able
to give you this...

37:40.752 --> 37:43.019
Thank you.

37:44.055 --> 37:47.123
Can I cook you something?

37:47.125 --> 37:48.691
I'll make you anything you want.

37:48.726 --> 37:53.029
No, I just want us to lie here
and stare at each other.

37:53.064 --> 37:55.031
Not say anything.

37:58.836 --> 38:01.237
Oh, God.

38:01.272 --> 38:03.706
You're so beautiful.

38:06.811 --> 38:09.045
I thought you wanted us
to be quiet.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.846
Well, couldn't help it.

38:10.882 --> 38:12.760
You know, you always tell me
how beautiful I am.

38:12.784 --> 38:14.528
You never give me a chance
to tell you how handsome

38:14.552 --> 38:15.618
I think you are.

38:15.653 --> 38:17.086
I thought you loved me
for my mind.

38:17.121 --> 38:18.454
I do.

38:18.489 --> 38:19.588
But that doesn't mean

38:19.624 --> 38:22.925
that I don't also think
you're handsome.

38:29.801 --> 38:32.268
Mike, what's going on?

38:32.303 --> 38:34.804
There's something
I need to tell you.

38:34.839 --> 38:39.108
Does it have something to do
with why you're really here?

38:39.143 --> 38:41.944
Because I didn't believe
what you told me earlier.

38:41.979 --> 38:44.313
Why didn't you say something?

38:44.348 --> 38:50.019
Because you're here,
so I didn't care.

39:02.567 --> 39:03.999
What's that?

39:04.035 --> 39:05.746
I'm unwinding my position
with Nathan Byrnes' company.

39:05.770 --> 39:06.969
Well, I appreciate that.

39:07.004 --> 39:08.715
But I don't need to take home
the paper trail.

39:08.739 --> 39:10.473
It's not a paper trail.

39:10.508 --> 39:11.841
It's an engagement letter.

39:11.876 --> 39:14.321
Turns out my attorney was filing
my positions before he had to,

39:14.345 --> 39:15.711
so I let him go.

39:15.746 --> 39:17.446
You want me to
take you as a client.

39:17.482 --> 39:18.447
If you'll have me.

39:18.483 --> 39:19.682
On one condition.

39:19.717 --> 39:22.485
I hear you've been having fun
with Louis Litt.

39:22.520 --> 39:25.154
But it stops now.

39:25.189 --> 39:26.155
Done.

39:40.705 --> 39:42.883
I should have known a guy
who would hire a fraud like that

39:42.907 --> 39:44.206
would pull a stunt like this.

39:44.242 --> 39:47.076
This stunt is gonna get you
exactly what you want.

39:47.111 --> 39:48.611
No, Harvey.
I'm gonna get what I want

39:48.646 --> 39:50.179
by telling that kid's
fiancée the truth

39:50.214 --> 39:51.492
and letting her do
the work for me.

39:51.516 --> 39:52.848
Listen to me, Sean.

39:52.884 --> 39:55.284
She doesn't know because
he doesn't want her to know.

39:55.319 --> 39:56.719
I don't give a shit
what he wants.

39:56.754 --> 39:59.021
Then trust me, this is the
only way to get what <i> you</i> want.

39:59.056 --> 40:00.789
Trust you?
You lied to my face.

40:00.825 --> 40:02.158
I made a judgment call.

40:02.193 --> 40:03.504
Then look me in the eye
and tell me you didn't

40:03.528 --> 40:05.861
make that call before
you asked me to get him out.

40:05.897 --> 40:07.163
I knew it.

40:07.198 --> 40:09.209
The whole time you were
always gonna bring him here.

40:09.233 --> 40:10.611
Because this is
the way to get it done.

40:10.635 --> 40:12.346
Then why didn't you tell me
that in the first place?

40:12.370 --> 40:14.810
Because it would have ended up
with you wanting to use Rachel.

40:14.839 --> 40:15.804
It ended there anyway.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.917
Now get the hell out of my way.

40:16.941 --> 40:18.240
Don't make me stop you, Sean.

40:18.276 --> 40:20.342
Are you threatening
a federal prosecutor, Harvey?

40:20.378 --> 40:21.418
You're goddamn right I am.

40:21.445 --> 40:22.589
Well, you better think
about this move

40:22.613 --> 40:23.891
more than you thought
about the last one.

40:23.915 --> 40:25.125
'Cause it's not gonna
end well for you.

40:25.149 --> 40:27.616
Far as I'm concerned,
it's the same move.

40:27.652 --> 40:30.619
I made a promise
and I'm not gonna break it.

40:31.722 --> 40:34.356
Harvey!

40:34.392 --> 40:37.026
Whatever you're fighting about,
you can stop.

40:37.061 --> 40:40.229
I told Rachel everything.

40:40.264 --> 40:42.431
I'm taking the deal.

40:44.168 --> 40:47.136
Then let's get in the car
and get moving.
