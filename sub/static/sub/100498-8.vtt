WEBVTT

00:44.127 --> 00:45.045
MAN :

03:18.489 --> 03:19.991
Hey.

03:52.482 --> 03:53.733
SAUL:
What's so funny?

03:58.613 --> 04:02.033
-Ah, you wouldn't get it.
-Okay.

04:02.116 --> 04:04.369
Okay, here's what you're gonna do.

04:04.452 --> 04:09.999
You're gonna take 25 South to Las Cruces.
You can pick up 10 West from there.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.919
Hey, write this down, man, <i>es complicado.</i>

04:13.002 --> 04:14.796
Ten West at Las Cruces.

04:14.879 --> 04:19.717
A little past Deming, there's a state road. It's 146.

04:19.801 --> 04:25.723
Uh, follow the signs to Antelope Wells
until Mile Marker 223.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.893
Turn off at the dirt road and take it 30 miles south.

04:28.977 --> 04:33.564
-Thirty miles down a dirt road?
-Fewer eyes out in the desert, you know?

04:33.648 --> 04:34.857
Actually, it's 31.6.

04:34.941 --> 04:39.821
So make sure that you use the little, you know,
trip meter thing on the odometer, whatever.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.116
Anyway, once you get there,
you're gonna see a well.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.702
It's really old. You know, broken down.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.079
What does this well look like?

04:48.162 --> 04:50.623
It looks like a well. It's the only one out there.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.626
-Can you see it from the road?
-You'll see it. Don't worry about it.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.629
My cousins are gonna meet you there
with the money, 9 a.m.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.840
-You'll like them. They're good boys.
-I'll bet.

04:58.923 --> 05:00.842
Um...

05:00.925 --> 05:04.220
Hey, I have an idea.
Why not have these cousins of yours

05:04.304 --> 05:06.639
bring the money just all the way here?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.641
Cut out the middleman.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.435
Yeah, see, the thing is,

05:10.518 --> 05:14.314
this whole thing has
to be very low-profile, you know?

05:15.315 --> 05:19.944
There are people, let's say competitors of mine,
people who wanna keep me in here.

05:20.028 --> 05:25.074
And so, you know, my cousins come into town,
those people will notice.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.370
What about Nacho Varga, right?
Would your competitors notice him?

05:29.454 --> 05:32.999
He seems like he's got
a pretty good head on his shoulders.

05:33.082 --> 05:35.084
You mean Ignacio?

05:35.168 --> 05:39.589
Yeah, sure, I mean, he's good for a lot of things.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.883
But with 7 million? Pfft.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.261
A guy like that could get real dumb real fast,
you know?

05:45.344 --> 05:48.514
Hey, you're the right guy for this. You're nobody.

05:48.598 --> 05:52.018
I mean, no offense,
but nobody's gonna look twice at you.

05:53.728 --> 05:55.646
Yeah, sure. Um...

05:57.607 --> 06:01.486
Hey, look, maybe this isn't your thing, you know?
I mean, that's okay. I get it.

06:01.569 --> 06:05.156
You did good in court. We'll leave it at that.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.035
Well, thanks, that's... I appreciate that.

06:09.118 --> 06:10.953
Don't worry about it.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.289
I'll find somebody else, you know?

06:14.290 --> 06:18.753
Yeah. Uh, so I guess we're done here.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.880
Guess so.

06:22.965 --> 06:24.133
All right.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.385
I will... I'm gonna shred these.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.678
And, uh...

06:28.679 --> 06:34.143
if there's anything else you need,
any legal services...

06:34.227 --> 06:37.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got your number. See you.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.445
This stupid thing.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
Ahem, hundred thousand?

06:57.750 --> 06:59.460
Dollars?

07:01.003 --> 07:03.756
-Yeah.
-That's a lot of money.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.551
To bring back 7 mil? And I'm the best guy to do it?

07:06.634 --> 07:12.098
Uh, that's actually less
than 2 percent commission. I think it's right.

07:15.435 --> 07:19.605
So 100K for a little drive through the desert, huh?

07:22.150 --> 07:24.277
That's the price.

07:29.949 --> 07:30.908
Done.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.584
Hey, I'm home.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.420
JIMMY:
Great. I'll be out in a sec.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.382
Evening shower, huh?

07:46.466 --> 07:49.886
Yeah. Got an early day tomorrow.

07:52.180 --> 07:55.141
Hey, I hope you're hungry. I'm making fajitas.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.853
-You're cooking?
-Yeah, why not?

07:58.936 --> 08:01.898
I picked up some strip steak on the way home,

08:01.981 --> 08:07.445
and it's been marinating for a couple hours
in a secret blend of herbs and spices.

08:07.528 --> 08:08.988
-Really?
-Yeah.

08:09.071 --> 08:12.533
Something I like to call "Old El Paso."

08:12.617 --> 08:15.244
KIM:
Heh-heh. It sounds exotic.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.039
JIMMY:
It'll be delicious, you'll see.

08:18.122 --> 08:22.168
I, uh... I have some business news.

08:25.463 --> 08:28.216
You're a friend of the cartel? Is that it?

08:29.217 --> 08:31.260
Not exactly.

08:33.429 --> 08:34.972
Maybe.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.268
You got him bail?

08:39.352 --> 08:43.189
Some evidence fell into my lap.
I was kind of obligated to use it.

08:43.272 --> 08:45.274
You know, for my client.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.654
When you said you couldn't do it,
I knew you'd find a way.

08:50.821 --> 08:54.033
There's a complication.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.161
Remember that time you had a PD case

08:57.245 --> 09:00.748
with the kid whose parents kicked him out
because he got caught with a joint?

09:00.831 --> 09:01.791
Yeah.

09:01.874 --> 09:06.879
And you had to drive all the way out
to the uncle's house, I think it was in Moriarty,

09:06.963 --> 09:08.422
to pick up the bail? Well--

09:08.506 --> 09:13.135
Wait, what? So, what, you're saying
you're gonna pick up Salamanca's bail?

09:13.219 --> 09:17.223
Yeah, only it's a little further than Moriarty
and a little more money.

09:17.306 --> 09:20.226
-How much?
-Seven.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.062
-Seven thousand?
-Million.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.773
-Seven million?
-Yeah.

09:26.774 --> 09:31.404
You're going to pick up $7 million of cartel money?

09:31.487 --> 09:34.657
I know what you're thinking,
but it's safe. Completely.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.285
-A quick drive down by the border, I'll be back.
-The border?

09:37.368 --> 09:40.871
Jimmy, you are an attorney, not a bagman.

09:40.955 --> 09:43.583
There's no amount of money that is worth this.

09:43.666 --> 09:46.627
-Can't his people do it?
-He trusts me.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.629
I'm his attorney, that's it.

09:48.713 --> 09:51.090
You're making a bigger deal out of this
than you need to.

09:51.173 --> 09:54.385
-What?
-I will pick it up in the morning, I will be done

09:54.468 --> 09:56.220
and I'll be home before you will.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.556
Okay. Then I'm going with you.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.726
Well, they're only expecting me.
You know, one guy?

10:01.809 --> 10:05.271
I mean, that's kind of the whole point.
You know, security through obscurity.

10:05.354 --> 10:08.065
-Jimmy, this is insane, I--
-No, listen, it's just little old me

10:08.149 --> 10:10.109
in my little old Suzuki Esteem.

10:10.192 --> 10:15.281
And there has never been more than 50 bucks
in an Esteem in the history of Esteems.

10:15.364 --> 10:18.034
So no one's gonna look at me twice.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.829
You sound like you are talking yourself into this.

10:22.830 --> 10:26.083
I will be okay. I swear.

10:26.167 --> 10:32.340
If I smell even the faintest whiff of anything wrong,
I'll be out of there like a shot.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.677
I don't like this.

10:37.762 --> 10:40.264
I don't want you to do it.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.775
Kim, listen.

10:50.858 --> 10:55.071
I swear, okay? I'll be fine.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.029
L-- Lawyer.

13:00.112 --> 13:06.952
From Lalo. Eduardo sent me
to pick up the, uh, dinero.

13:28.224 --> 13:32.269
I'll just take these back to Lalo.

13:33.771 --> 13:37.441
You guys are just gonna... Just go?

13:38.442 --> 13:40.152
Well, that'll work.

13:43.405 --> 13:44.907
All right.

14:02.591 --> 14:04.093
Woof.

Oh, nuts.

15:44.985 --> 15:46.445
Okay, yeah.

15:46.528 --> 15:49.782
Coming out. Slowly.

16:06.048 --> 16:11.428
I think-- I think I have a sense
of what you want here. It's in the trunk.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.181
Yeah, good. Take those.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.426
Whoa, whoa. What? No, no.
That's not what he meant.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.302
No, this is a mistake. It's a big--

16:56.890 --> 16:57.891
No!

20:13.629 --> 20:15.130
MIKE:
You hit?

20:18.926 --> 20:22.137
-Hit?
-Are you shot?

20:30.020 --> 20:31.521
Get up.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.650
Shot?

20:36.526 --> 20:37.653
You're in shock.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.532
You stay here and breathe.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.144
MIKE:
Hey.

22:35.145 --> 22:39.733
You're alive. Focus on that.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.075
You'll be okay.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.909
Get out. The alternator's shot.

23:32.369 --> 23:34.079
Literally.

24:05.777 --> 24:10.240
All right. I'm gonna need you
to put your back into this.

24:11.867 --> 24:13.493
Push!

24:29.843 --> 24:34.181
JIMMY:
Oh, oh! Wait! Wait, wait, wait!

24:35.807 --> 24:37.475
What is it?

24:38.894 --> 24:40.604
Where is it?

25:37.827 --> 25:39.913
Did you know all this was gonna happen?

25:40.914 --> 25:43.959
If I did, I would've brought more guys.

25:44.042 --> 25:47.337
Let's get that to where it belongs. This way.

25:47.420 --> 25:50.090
Well, uh, home is that way.

25:52.467 --> 25:55.178
One of those guys got away in a car.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.306
On the road. This road.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.684
We gotta get off it.

26:53.194 --> 26:55.113
JIMMY:
Big mistake...

26:55.196 --> 26:56.781
discontinuing...

26:56.865 --> 26:58.241
thousand dollar bill.

26:58.325 --> 27:00.368
Mm. Big.

27:02.620 --> 27:04.998
These would've been so much lighter.

27:09.336 --> 27:10.754
Hey.

27:12.005 --> 27:15.383
How about we take turns
with these bad boys, you know?

27:15.467 --> 27:17.385
So we both stay fresh?

27:21.264 --> 27:22.891
Fine.

27:28.521 --> 27:33.026
-I got an idea. Let's dig a hole.
-A hole?

27:33.109 --> 27:37.906
Yeah. Walk out of here, get to civilization,
drive back, pick it up.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.533
Work smarter, not harder.

27:40.617 --> 27:41.785
You'll never find it.

27:41.868 --> 27:45.038
Oh, I will because I'll memorize the landmarks.

27:45.121 --> 27:50.293
Like this tree? You can't miss it.
That hill, that's distinctive.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.546
It's got a hill shape.

27:53.630 --> 27:59.511
Yeah, very different from the couple dozen trees
we've seen on hillsides that we walked past.

27:59.594 --> 28:03.306
I will remember. I will find this tree.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.815
MIKE:
Mmm.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.943
That's hard pack.

28:15.026 --> 28:18.405
If you manage to dig a hole big enough
for those two bags,

28:18.488 --> 28:20.824
you might as well dig one for yourself.

28:24.369 --> 28:28.581
Oh, come on. That's not gonna work.

28:31.334 --> 28:33.461
You are wasting energy.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.089
I'm almost there.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.099
It's working. Heh.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.149
Stop.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.070
Put that away. They'll see it.

28:59.154 --> 29:02.282
You take off anything that'll catch the light.

29:03.158 --> 29:05.869
-Is it him?
-Oh, yeah.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.372
It looks like they're doing a grid search.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.332
Meaning?

29:11.416 --> 29:14.711
MIKE:
Meaning they found your car.

30:16.856 --> 30:19.108
I'd go easy on that.

30:39.629 --> 30:40.964
Hey, why are we camping?

30:41.047 --> 30:43.925
I mean, shouldn't we keep walking?
It's cooler at night.

30:44.008 --> 30:48.429
You go out there in the dark,
you're gonna break your leg in a prairie-dog hole.

31:23.131 --> 31:25.216
Hey, we gotta be halfway there, right?

31:25.300 --> 31:26.885
Almost.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.928
"Almost."

31:53.119 --> 31:57.290
I should have been home hours ago.
This will be tearing her up.

31:57.373 --> 31:59.876
Oh, she's just gonna think
you're out catting around.

31:59.959 --> 32:01.794
No, she won't.

32:01.878 --> 32:05.673
She's gonna think I'm chopped to pieces,
dead in some ditch.

32:06.966 --> 32:08.635
And why is she gonna think that?

32:11.179 --> 32:13.264
Are you saying she knows what you're doing?

32:14.265 --> 32:18.144
Not, you know, the details.

32:18.227 --> 32:22.732
She knows I'm picking up money
down by the border, that's all.

32:22.815 --> 32:27.195
-You told your girlfriend what you're doing?
-My wife.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.407
-Wife?
-Yeah, wife.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.452
Congratulations.

32:35.453 --> 32:38.331
And what's your wife gonna do
with this information, do you think?

32:38.414 --> 32:40.375
-Call the cops?
-No.

32:40.458 --> 32:43.628
No? People get scared, call the cops.
Pretty standard.

32:43.711 --> 32:45.296
No, she's not calling any cops.

32:45.380 --> 32:48.716
Her mother. Girls at the book club.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.135
Gonna call her boss,
tell her about her missing husband.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.930
No, she's not doing any of that, okay?
She knows better.

32:54.013 --> 32:57.976
She's just gonna be scared out of her mind, is all.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.811
Oh.

32:59.894 --> 33:03.606
Well, let's hope you're right.

33:07.402 --> 33:09.195
She knows.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.406
She's in the game now.

33:11.489 --> 33:14.784
What? No. She's not in the game, all right?

33:14.867 --> 33:17.161
She's not even game-adjacent.

33:17.245 --> 33:22.291
I just told her the truth.
A little slice of the truth. That's all.

33:22.375 --> 33:24.085
Mmm.

33:24.168 --> 33:27.213
-She's not in the game.
-Yeah.

33:38.725 --> 33:43.271
Well, I can't make a fire.
Our guy may still be out there.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.566
Oh...

34:08.212 --> 34:10.006
I got two of these, you want one?

34:11.340 --> 34:13.176
No, thanks.

34:13.259 --> 34:17.430
-Gets cold fast.
-I'm fine. Thanks.

34:20.016 --> 34:22.185
You suit yourself.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.142
-Ma'am, do you want me to--?
-Yes, please.

35:21.327 --> 35:22.245
Thank you.

35:34.507 --> 35:38.678
I know I misrepresented myself
as a member of your legal team,

35:38.761 --> 35:42.682
I apologize for that.

35:43.683 --> 35:46.352
I wouldn't be here right now
if I didn't absolutely have to be.

35:54.026 --> 35:57.280
I know who are. Who you actually are.

35:57.363 --> 35:58.948
We have something in common.

35:59.031 --> 36:02.743
You wanna know where your money is,
I wanna find Saul Goodman.

36:02.827 --> 36:06.747
If you tell me where you sent him,
I won't alert the authorities, I won't tell anyone.

36:06.831 --> 36:10.501
I will find him and you'll get your money.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.597
Mr. Salamanca--

36:22.680 --> 36:25.808
Who the hell are you
that he tells you my business?

36:25.892 --> 36:28.394
He didn't betray your confidence.

36:28.477 --> 36:32.231
We're married,
which means I have spousal privilege.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.358
Anything he says to me stays with me.

36:34.442 --> 36:38.237
No one can make me discuss it.
It's as bulletproof as lawyer-client privilege.

36:39.238 --> 36:41.532
So you're his wife?

36:43.201 --> 36:44.535
Yes.

36:49.665 --> 36:51.083
Huh.

36:53.294 --> 36:59.175
So you're his wife and you love him,

36:59.258 --> 37:02.720
and he didn't come home last night,

37:02.803 --> 37:07.808
and you got scared enough
to come down here and talk to me.

37:10.353 --> 37:13.147
What makes you think
he didn't run off with my money, huh?

37:13.231 --> 37:15.441
He did not run off with your money.

37:15.524 --> 37:17.193
Yeah, maybe not.

37:18.194 --> 37:19.278
Not without you.

37:19.362 --> 37:22.406
Just tell me where you sent him. That's all I need.

37:23.616 --> 37:25.159
I don't think so.

37:26.160 --> 37:30.873
Your man, he's, um...
He's like <i>la cucaracha</i>, you know?

37:30.957 --> 37:32.541
Born survivor.

37:32.625 --> 37:37.797
If trouble found him, give it a day.
If he's alive, he'll show.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.423
And if he's--?

37:39.507 --> 37:43.219
Well, then a day's not gonna make
a difference, is it?

37:44.220 --> 37:49.016
All right. Well, nice to meet you, Mrs. Goodman.

37:51.352 --> 37:54.772
Wait, um, Mr. Salamanca...

37:56.274 --> 37:58.109
Done!

38:38.816 --> 38:41.819
Hey. I wouldn't waste that.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.989
Waste what?

38:46.574 --> 38:49.744
I don't have enough of this for the both of us.

No. You want more...

41:46.921 --> 41:48.464
All right.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.428
Come on. Let's go.

42:05.648 --> 42:08.651
Hold it. I have an idea.

42:29.964 --> 42:33.008
-That's not gonna work.
-This is gonna work.

43:56.550 --> 43:57.968
You gonna get that?

43:58.969 --> 44:00.763
Get what?

44:02.806 --> 44:04.391
Oh.

44:09.396 --> 44:11.065
Got it.

44:12.232 --> 44:14.193
Oh, crap.

44:58.570 --> 44:59.905
Hey. Aah! Shit!

45:12.751 --> 45:16.588
Ugh. Ah! That's it. I'm done.

45:16.672 --> 45:17.673
Done!

45:19.049 --> 45:20.592
Done!

45:20.676 --> 45:22.219
Quiet.

45:22.302 --> 45:25.973
Why? I'm quiet, I'm loud,
I'm gonna die in this dirt one way or the other.

45:26.056 --> 45:27.808
Let's get it over with.

45:28.809 --> 45:30.185
-Get up.
-No.

45:31.186 --> 45:32.855
I'm not going.

45:33.856 --> 45:35.941
I'm done.

45:36.024 --> 45:37.818
Everything hurts.

45:38.819 --> 45:41.655
God, I'm so thirsty.

45:41.738 --> 45:43.699
You need to drink.

45:43.782 --> 45:47.786
What's the point? So they can find a corpse
with a mouth full of piss?

45:47.870 --> 45:52.166
That's not gonna happen. Now get up.

45:54.918 --> 45:56.587
Come on.

46:02.968 --> 46:06.472
Oh, God. Oh, no. How--?

46:07.473 --> 46:09.349
How the hell are you still going?

46:09.433 --> 46:13.562
Because I know why I'm out here. That's how.

46:13.645 --> 46:15.606
I know what it's for.

46:15.689 --> 46:19.359
And I can't drag that money out of here by myself.

46:20.527 --> 46:26.533
So you-- You get up, and you get up now.

46:26.617 --> 46:31.330
What it's for? What is it for?

46:35.834 --> 46:37.544
I have people.

46:38.545 --> 46:42.549
I have people waiting for me.

46:42.633 --> 46:45.427
They don't know what I do, they never will.

46:46.428 --> 46:48.680
They're protected.

46:48.764 --> 46:52.434
But I do what I do so they can have a better life.

46:52.518 --> 46:56.688
And if I live or if I die,
it really doesn't make a difference to me

46:56.772 --> 47:00.317
as long as they have what they need.

47:00.400 --> 47:02.694
So when it's my time to go,

47:02.778 --> 47:07.324
I will go knowing I did everything I could for them.

47:08.325 --> 47:12.955
Now, you ask me how I keep going?

47:14.748 --> 47:16.750
That's how.

47:29.096 --> 47:32.349
Stay down. He's back.

48:10.887 --> 48:12.639
Lie low.

48:12.723 --> 48:15.475
We're gonna have to wait him out.

48:53.805 --> 48:56.892
Hey, get that thing ready.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.502
Come on, you asshole.

49:23.585 --> 49:26.171
You want this 7 mil?

49:27.130 --> 49:29.925
Come on, I'm just walking here

49:30.008 --> 49:32.469
like a goddamn idiot!

49:46.733 --> 49:49.611
Come and get some, you dickhead.

49:55.075 --> 49:58.120
You son of a bitch. Look at me!

50:14.094 --> 50:17.973
MIKE:
Yeah, there you go.

50:41.621 --> 50:43.874
Come on. Come on.
