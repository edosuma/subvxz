00:01.641 --> 00:03.340
Previously on "The Closer"...

00:04.141 --> 00:07.385
Oscar! I need you to send units to 1st
and Indiana. My brother's been shot.

00:07.505 --> 00:09.153
We will find who did this.

00:10.048 --> 00:11.547
Ricardo Ramos from the Times.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.726
He's gonna be trailing
priority homicide's investigation.

00:15.250 --> 00:16.748
Nice to meet you, chief Johnson.

00:16.868 --> 00:19.021
I take orders
from assistant chief Will Pope.

00:19.141 --> 00:21.854
And 9 times out of 10,
decisions he makes anticipate

00:21.974 --> 00:24.772
what's going to be splashed across
the front page of your paper.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.048
Have you read the Times today?
"90% of the time,

00:27.168 --> 00:31.904
priority homicide division is deployed
to anticipate media coverage."

00:32.024 --> 00:33.620
Did you actually say this?

00:33.780 --> 00:37.108
PHD handles more white murder victims
than robbery/homicide,

00:37.228 --> 00:40.198
and that has nothing to do with me.
That's how you assign cases.

00:40.318 --> 00:43.921
Priority homicide has run its course.
It's over. I'm shutting it down.

00:45.166 --> 00:47.717
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Kiry

00:48.310 --> 00:50.943
Deputy chief Brenda Leigh Johnson,
priority homicide...

00:52.319 --> 00:54.098
Major crimes division.

00:54.218 --> 00:55.821
Shoot. Can we start over?

00:55.941 --> 00:58.172
<i>I can't. I'm not allowed
to edit any of this, and once...</i>

00:58.292 --> 01:00.236
Just cut it, then. Just stop the tape.

01:00.356 --> 01:02.671
I can't. Once I start recording,
I can't stop.

01:03.169 --> 01:05.275
All right, then,
just get the body please.

01:06.277 --> 01:08.275
No, no, no. Let's start over here.

01:08.522 --> 01:09.465
Thank you.

01:09.585 --> 01:11.145
Watch out for the glass.

01:13.249 --> 01:15.375
And you need to stay there
for a second.

01:17.664 --> 01:19.067
Okay, lieutenant Tao

01:19.597 --> 01:21.835
- what happened here?
- I can't look underneath him, but

01:22.296 --> 01:25.974
judging from the damage to the mirror
and the size of the spatter

01:26.512 --> 01:29.515
and the way the blood has collected
on the bed linen,

01:29.635 --> 01:32.756
I'm thinking, perhaps,
a shotgun blast to the belly.

01:33.795 --> 01:35.859
Must have been in a lot of pain
before he died.

01:35.979 --> 01:38.059
Look at the way
he was grabbing at the sheets.

01:39.548 --> 01:42.939
Why are we always waiting for
the coroner's investigator these days?

01:45.051 --> 01:46.744
All right, since I can't touch the body,

01:46.864 --> 01:48.795
maybe someone could tell me
about this gentleman?

01:48.915 --> 01:50.330
Like, his name, for example?

01:50.450 --> 01:53.545
Yeah, the neighbor who called in
the shots-fired knew him as Darren.

01:53.665 --> 01:55.737
Last name on the mailbox is Melman.

01:56.154 --> 01:59.760
Well, my vast experience as a detective
tells me that his name is

02:00.051 --> 02:01.166
Darren Melman.

02:02.666 --> 02:05.233
I found these unpaid bills
with Melman's name on it.

02:05.353 --> 02:07.019
That doesn't mean he's our victim.

02:07.139 --> 02:09.838
A neighbor said that Melman
was some kind of building contractor.

02:09.958 --> 02:12.027
Isn't he a little young
to be a contractor?

02:12.147 --> 02:14.091
Only have to be 18 in this state.

02:14.376 --> 02:16.367
All right, sergeant Gabriel,
I'd like a photograph.

02:16.487 --> 02:18.117
Please run his name through the DMV.

02:18.237 --> 02:21.146
Also check through the state
contractors licensing board.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.063
And let's find out if he has
a police record of any kind. Also,

02:24.223 --> 02:26.470
- next of kin. I'm on it, chief.
- Thank you.

02:27.972 --> 02:29.811
Did Mr. Melman have a roommate?

02:29.931 --> 02:32.563
- Not according to his landlord.
- And what about a girlfriend?

02:32.683 --> 02:35.116
Well, would you go out with
anybody who kept a place like this?

02:35.276 --> 02:39.121
I mean, I would say it was a robbery,
but how would you know what was missing?

02:41.013 --> 02:42.999
Well, no one stole the computer.

02:43.159 --> 02:45.764
We'll take that with us.
And dump the phones.

02:45.884 --> 02:49.438
I'm assuming that his cellphone's still
on his body, lieutenant Tao?

02:49.983 --> 02:52.634
Maybe. Chief, there's velcro
on his sleeve.

02:53.286 --> 02:54.286
Odd.

02:55.424 --> 02:58.141
What is keeping that slow poke
coroner's investigator?

02:58.659 --> 03:01.385
My son's sick. Waiting for my mom
to sit with him.

03:01.505 --> 03:02.920
Hate to leave you hanging.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.402
I'm so sorry.

03:06.043 --> 03:07.043
Poor thing.

03:09.000 --> 03:15.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:18.062 --> 03:20.139
Chief, this was taped to the wall.

03:20.390 --> 03:22.886
And the victim's got a whole notebook
with the same drawing.

03:23.006 --> 03:25.336
Double "E." Is that some kind
of gang symbol?

03:25.456 --> 03:26.291
No.

03:27.907 --> 03:29.504
Well, maybe it's a business logo.

03:29.783 --> 03:31.741
Or an old girlfriend's initials.

03:31.861 --> 03:32.861
Chief.

03:41.038 --> 03:42.038
Chief.

03:42.260 --> 03:44.219
Not much in the way
of personal belongings,

03:44.339 --> 03:48.184
but we do have some roofing nails
and some plumbing pipe.

03:48.304 --> 03:50.249
That makes sense if he's a contractor.

03:50.369 --> 03:53.903
Also three kinds of ammunition,
including rifle bullets.

03:54.063 --> 03:56.067
What would he be hunting
in the hollywood hills?

03:56.187 --> 03:59.318
Not much without rifles,
but maybe someone stole his guns.

04:01.101 --> 04:02.101
Sir,

04:02.605 --> 04:06.261
I really need you to get the wallet and
the cellphone off the victim, please.

04:06.381 --> 04:08.157
Chief, I think I see his cellphone.

04:08.277 --> 04:09.308
Wait, wait!

04:09.428 --> 04:10.737
- What?
- Okay.

04:11.054 --> 04:13.423
The nonconcentric abrasions
concern me. But...

04:14.764 --> 04:15.764
Look at this.

04:15.884 --> 04:18.195
- What?
- This is not a bullet fragment.

04:19.572 --> 04:21.293
See this oblong piece here?

04:22.139 --> 04:23.462
This is shrapnel.

04:25.337 --> 04:26.811
That says "bomb". Everybody out!

04:26.971 --> 04:29.476
- No, no, hang on!
- Sergeant Gabriel, call the bomb squad.

04:29.596 --> 04:31.472
No, delay that order.
I want the computer, and

04:31.592 --> 04:34.027
I need the cellphone and the wallet.
Then we call the bomb squad.

04:34.187 --> 04:35.724
No way, chief. Everybody out now.

04:35.844 --> 04:37.405
- Gabriel, you grab her!
- No!

04:37.851 --> 04:39.073
- Sorry, chief!
- No!

04:39.233 --> 04:42.266
No! Detective, I am issuing
a direct order!

04:42.727 --> 04:45.492
Detective! Detective! And my purse!

04:48.098 --> 04:49.739
Put me down this instant!

04:50.026 --> 04:52.642
I mean it! You had better
put me down!

04:53.140 --> 04:54.233
My purse!

04:54.617 --> 04:55.715
My purse!

05:01.190 --> 05:02.764
This is ridiculous.

05:03.188 --> 05:04.891
I'm conducting a murder investigation.

05:05.051 --> 05:07.261
Y'all had no right to haul me out
like a sack of potatoes!

05:07.381 --> 05:09.708
Chief, you get upset with us
when we break the rules,

05:09.828 --> 05:11.715
you get upset with us when
we follow the rules.

05:11.835 --> 05:15.526
If you want to beef us for pulling you
out of a bomb scene, be my guest.

05:17.126 --> 05:18.793
Commander, I want good news.

05:18.913 --> 05:21.866
We've evacuated the building,
and we're clearing the block

05:22.026 --> 05:24.118
so the bomb squad can set up
their forward post.

05:24.278 --> 05:26.598
Okay, how soon do I get
my crime scene back?

05:26.718 --> 05:27.638
Tao?

05:27.758 --> 05:29.160
12 hours, give or take.

05:29.280 --> 05:31.363
- You're joking.
- That's standard protocol, chief.

05:31.483 --> 05:33.795
But the bomb already went off.
It killed our victim.

05:33.955 --> 05:35.993
There may be more bombs up
in that building.

05:36.113 --> 05:37.918
Anyways, it's not really up to us,

05:38.038 --> 05:40.885
so I recommend that we let them
do their jobs as safely as they can,

05:41.045 --> 05:41.870
all right?

05:41.990 --> 05:45.151
Bomb squad already notified
FBI and homeland security.

05:46.037 --> 05:47.558
This goes from bad to worse.

05:47.718 --> 05:50.310
I need to see that body.
It is vitally important

05:50.430 --> 05:53.585
that I get that computer and
that cellphone as soon as possible.

05:53.705 --> 05:55.208
<i>Good morning, lieutenant.</i>

05:56.017 --> 05:57.235
<i>How can I help you?</i>

05:57.704 --> 05:59.609
- Here she comes.
- Here who comes?

05:59.729 --> 06:00.571
Babs!

06:00.731 --> 06:01.890
Saint Barbara.

06:03.407 --> 06:05.868
Patron saint of all bomb techs.
She's named after her.

06:06.681 --> 06:08.976
State-of-the-art in UGVS.

06:09.488 --> 06:11.261
Unmanned ground vehicles.

06:14.714 --> 06:15.898
Ain't she cool?

06:16.497 --> 06:19.996
Does she have a second gear,
or is she the slowest robot on Earth?

06:20.116 --> 06:23.302
When you're handling bombs,
it's not good to rush Babs.

06:23.586 --> 06:26.655
Hey, provenza, that robot looks
like you running.

06:26.775 --> 06:28.580
Oh, you're so full of it, Flynn.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.780
You know that I don't run.

06:53.878 --> 06:56.405
Babs is almost at the front door.

06:56.525 --> 06:57.966
Oh, for Heaven's sakes!

06:58.086 --> 07:00.006
Hey, chief, I have
the victim's rap sheet.

07:00.166 --> 07:03.468
Darren Melman, age 19,
one juvenile arrest two years ago.

07:03.628 --> 07:05.449
Great, great. Where and when, please?

07:05.569 --> 07:07.861
It doesn't say, I'll have to pull
the report when we get back

07:07.981 --> 07:09.046
to Parker Center.

07:09.166 --> 07:11.392
Okay, people, Babs has entered
the building.

07:30.032 --> 07:31.370
I'm climbing the stairs.

07:31.898 --> 07:33.962
Okay, Babs, watch those stairs.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.626
I know how you are.

07:38.955 --> 07:40.171
Okay, here we go.

07:45.428 --> 07:47.678
We want to move left into
the apartment.

07:51.648 --> 07:53.355
Turning. Turning.

07:53.976 --> 07:56.596
- Turning.
- Right. Good. Yeah, left.

08:03.253 --> 08:05.196
Very good. Okay, now pan right.

08:05.474 --> 08:06.474
Panning.

08:06.983 --> 08:08.259
Yeah, there you go.

08:09.253 --> 08:10.118
Oh, no!

08:10.407 --> 08:11.407
Oh, my...

08:11.617 --> 08:14.413
What the hell is she doing in there?!

08:14.573 --> 08:16.409
Y'all can stop worrying now.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.043
I have the wallet. Now I just need
to get the cellphone.

08:22.397 --> 08:24.558
And don't hurry on my account, Babs.

08:29.146 --> 08:30.179
<i>Pipe bomb.</i>

08:36.010 --> 08:37.010
Help...

08:37.544 --> 08:38.544
Me.

08:39.347 --> 08:41.315
- Get her out of there.
- Now, now!

08:41.475 --> 08:43.609
Get chief Johnson out of there now!

08:43.769 --> 08:45.791
Remove the chief now!

08:46.427 --> 08:47.798
Go! Go! Go! Go!

08:49.984 --> 08:51.409
She could totally blow up.

08:54.844 --> 08:56.656
I could walk this, you know.

09:09.578 --> 09:11.333
Do you have any idea

09:11.771 --> 09:13.835
how many, how many rules you broke?

09:14.463 --> 09:16.104
I had to get my purse.

09:16.652 --> 09:18.200
And look, I got the wallet.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.318
That'll give us something to do while
we wait for the computer and cellphone.

09:21.438 --> 09:22.999
You know, it's just, it's just,

09:23.119 --> 09:26.780
I would really hate to see you
get blown up by a pipe bomb

09:26.900 --> 09:28.844
just as I've gotten used to you.

09:28.964 --> 09:32.658
Well, I so appreciate the sentiment.
Oh, good, driver's license.

09:32.935 --> 09:36.245
Darren Melman. That looks like our victim,
so we're on the right guy.

09:37.141 --> 09:38.291
Detective daniels,

09:38.411 --> 09:42.142
here is a receipt from home
supply central for $358.

09:42.262 --> 09:45.429
It's organized by UPC codes, so
I can find out exactly what he bought.

09:45.549 --> 09:47.040
- Wonderful.
- What's that?

09:47.339 --> 09:48.674
You're kidding me.

09:49.442 --> 09:50.626
Fire in the hole!

09:50.746 --> 09:53.012
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

10:01.553 --> 10:03.432
Lieutenant, what just happened?

10:04.298 --> 10:07.276
The explosives on Melman were unstable,
so they had to be bip'ed.

10:07.685 --> 10:09.088
- What?
- B.I.P.

10:09.451 --> 10:10.827
Blown in place.

10:11.270 --> 10:12.593
So, where's my victim?

10:12.851 --> 10:15.841
My guess is he's probably
all over the ceiling.

10:17.012 --> 10:18.162
You blew him up?!

10:19.181 --> 10:20.665
What about the computer?

10:20.825 --> 10:22.324
What about the cellphone?

10:22.444 --> 10:23.584
What about Babs?

10:26.725 --> 10:31.050
Three boxes of 8-inch galvanized
metal pipe, 10 to a box.

10:31.660 --> 10:32.509
Check.

10:32.629 --> 10:33.629
One drill.

10:35.248 --> 10:37.765
Five boxes of light-anywhere matches.

10:39.301 --> 10:41.560
Two 50-pound boxes of roofing nails.

10:41.932 --> 10:42.932
Check.

10:43.569 --> 10:44.569
Check.

10:45.818 --> 10:46.818
Check.

10:47.015 --> 10:49.476
This is stuff you'd need
if you're a building contractor.

10:49.596 --> 10:52.538
But add some gunpowder,
you got yourself a bomb factory.

10:52.658 --> 10:53.498
Wait.

10:53.618 --> 10:56.470
There's one more item from the home
supply central receipt, and

10:56.590 --> 10:57.648
here it comes.

10:57.768 --> 10:59.494
Four propane tanks.

11:02.567 --> 11:03.777
Detective, no guns?

11:03.897 --> 11:06.460
This is everything you pulled
from the receipt from his wallet,

11:06.620 --> 11:08.904
but it doesn't cover the ammunition
we found at his home.

11:09.024 --> 11:10.968
We still don't know if he
has guns to go with it.

11:11.088 --> 11:14.553
I didn't see any propane tanks
in Darren Melman's apartment.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.213
Bet he has a storage unit.

11:16.333 --> 11:18.872
Or he already placed them
somewhere and set them to go off.

11:18.992 --> 11:21.578
So, did Melman blow himself up
or was he murdered?

11:21.698 --> 11:24.312
I don't know. He could have
been killed by a co-conspirator,

11:24.472 --> 11:28.399
which is why I wanted that computer
so badly and his cellphone.

11:28.559 --> 11:32.403
Chief, Melman's contractor's license
was up-to-date,

11:32.563 --> 11:34.655
no liens, no lawsuits, no complaints.

11:34.775 --> 11:39.130
But sgt Gabriel pulled the juvie arrest
record for our human roman candle.

11:39.484 --> 11:40.446
Good.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.922
Go ahead, sergeant.

11:42.412 --> 11:43.581
Tell her.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.890
I... I pulled the file
on the vandalism bust.

11:49.010 --> 11:52.859
And apparently, Mr. Melman broke
into his high school, where he...

11:55.711 --> 11:58.554
... defecated on the principal's desk.

11:59.520 --> 12:00.431
Ew.

12:00.711 --> 12:04.226
Which means he's been dropping bombs
his whole life.

12:05.471 --> 12:07.767
I said "ew," lieutenant, "Ew. Ew."

12:09.850 --> 12:12.776
Darren's parents are in the middle of a
three-week cruise on the Mediterranean.

12:12.896 --> 12:14.814
- We're trying to contact them.
- All right,

12:14.934 --> 12:18.446
maybe they can tell us who his friends
are and explain what this symbol means.

12:18.566 --> 12:19.784
About that double "E,"

12:19.944 --> 12:22.828
I've literally checked every symbol
and alphabet database I know.

12:23.531 --> 12:27.208
Satanic, gothic, pre-colombian,
celtic, aryan,

12:27.903 --> 12:30.535
a list of initials related
to famous criminals,

12:30.655 --> 12:32.626
eastern European serial killers,

12:32.746 --> 12:35.758
the L.A graffiti index,
popular tattoos,

12:35.918 --> 12:37.503
Asian calligraphy cults.

12:37.623 --> 12:39.053
You name it, no matches.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.574
I think it's probably
something personal.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.022
Chief, a DVD of the store's
security cam.

12:44.142 --> 12:45.142
Thank you.

12:49.139 --> 12:52.056
Y'all won't believe this.
He left almost a pound.

12:56.533 --> 12:58.364
Oh, for heaven's sake!

13:01.768 --> 13:04.700
The time and date stamp on
the home supply central receipt

13:04.820 --> 13:07.836
shows Melman checked out
with all the stuff at 10:38 a.m.

13:07.956 --> 13:10.955
We pulled the footage
from a half-hour before and after.

13:14.762 --> 13:16.627
There he is. There's Melman.

13:17.167 --> 13:20.331
Buzz, can you read
the license plate on that truck?

13:21.005 --> 13:22.454
I can blow it up for you.

13:34.852 --> 13:37.493
- And he brought a friend.
- Well, congratulations, everyone.

13:37.613 --> 13:39.341
We have a conspiracy.

13:40.974 --> 13:42.658
The truck is registered to Melman.

13:42.947 --> 13:44.900
Yeah, but who's the other little freak?

13:45.134 --> 13:47.131
Hang on, hang on. What's this?

13:49.164 --> 13:51.519
Maybe one of them can tell us.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.295
Okay, buzz, can you freeze
that and...

13:55.927 --> 13:57.131
... make it larger?

13:57.515 --> 13:59.261
- I sure can.
- Thank you.

14:02.757 --> 14:03.971
That's Darren Melman.

14:04.131 --> 14:06.317
He comes by home supply central a lot.

14:06.580 --> 14:08.618
I think he's a roofer or something.

14:08.738 --> 14:10.071
Y'all are good friends.

14:10.471 --> 14:11.605
Not really.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.053
- How do you know him?
- We went to high school together.

14:15.173 --> 14:16.317
OAK Valley west.

14:16.477 --> 14:17.318
Frank.

14:17.887 --> 14:18.764
What?

14:18.884 --> 14:21.530
- What about you?
- He's Frank. I'm Keith.

14:21.690 --> 14:24.024
I got out of OAK Valley
a year before Melman.

14:24.144 --> 14:26.648
I knew him, but he wasn't,
like, in my fave five.

14:26.768 --> 14:29.339
I don't think Melman
even graduated, did he?

14:30.348 --> 14:32.708
We heard about what he did in
the principal's office.

14:32.868 --> 14:33.916
Oh, yeah?

14:34.036 --> 14:35.603
I thought that was just a rumor.

14:35.723 --> 14:38.213
Well, the principal
was kind of a turd.

14:40.584 --> 14:43.450
Boys, Darren Melman
blew himself up this morning

14:43.570 --> 14:45.846
with supplies he bought
at your store.

14:46.342 --> 14:47.848
- Blew up?
- That's right.

14:48.008 --> 14:49.232
You mean like...

14:49.801 --> 14:51.685
Like, "exploded" blew up?

14:52.020 --> 14:55.230
His insides ripped apart
by a homemade pipe bomb

14:55.350 --> 14:57.347
packed with gunpowder and nails.

14:59.472 --> 15:01.986
How about the other guy in the video,
helping put stuff in the truck?

15:02.106 --> 15:03.402
You guys know his name?

15:06.214 --> 15:09.049
Y'all seem pretty chummy here
in the security video.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.499
- His name's Joe.
- No,

15:13.659 --> 15:15.027
John... something.

15:15.147 --> 15:16.397
John. Right.

15:16.648 --> 15:17.709
He was younger.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.069
Probably a senior at OAK Valley by now.

15:20.189 --> 15:23.507
And this John and Darren Melman,
were they good friends?

15:23.773 --> 15:25.487
We didn't really know him that well.

15:25.607 --> 15:27.555
Did John blow himself up, too?

15:28.387 --> 15:29.890
Not if I can help it.

15:30.335 --> 15:33.286
Two boys go out and buy
and build a small arsenal.

15:33.406 --> 15:34.907
One of them blows himself up.

15:35.027 --> 15:37.236
The other, a John somebody
from the videotape, is still

15:37.356 --> 15:40.636
very much at large and might be about
to use the weapons we can't account for.

15:40.756 --> 15:43.471
And, sir, both of these boys
went to the same high school.

15:43.591 --> 15:47.238
Which we now have very good reason
to evacuate. Commander.

15:47.485 --> 15:49.985
I'll alert L.A unified police.

15:50.105 --> 15:51.807
Call it an earthquake drill.

15:52.117 --> 15:53.498
If the school is the target,

15:53.618 --> 15:55.823
I don't want this kid
to know we're on to him.

15:56.076 --> 15:58.894
Let's make sure L.A.F.D has
two engine companies standing by,

15:59.014 --> 16:02.548
and I want every officer with a picture
of this John what's-his-name.

16:02.878 --> 16:05.775
Nobody gets off the grounds
until we check every face.

16:06.198 --> 16:08.387
Go over every inch of that school.

16:17.453 --> 16:19.729
I've been principal here
for going on 20 years,

16:19.849 --> 16:21.561
and I always know the bad kids.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.612
Darren Melman was a trouble maker.

16:24.939 --> 16:28.284
But John McFadden, the boy you're after,
he's, he's never been a problem.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.404
<i>Turning.</i>

16:32.217 --> 16:33.659
Is that gonna blow something up?

16:33.779 --> 16:35.998
Babs is a she. And no, sir.

16:36.158 --> 16:39.793
No, I think she'll use a water cannon
to open up that locker.

16:40.204 --> 16:43.465
When you're dealing with homemade
pipe bombs, you can't be too cautious.

16:44.698 --> 16:47.301
And Johnny's parents are good people,
too very involved.

16:47.461 --> 16:48.636
<i>Preparing to fire.</i>

16:49.880 --> 16:51.603
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

16:51.723 --> 16:54.283
Sir, let's go over here, please,
just to be safe.

16:55.063 --> 16:57.061
You might want to cover your ears.

17:00.448 --> 17:01.448
<i>Fire.</i>

17:04.685 --> 17:05.986
Good job, Babs.

17:15.811 --> 17:18.523
Sir, Darren Melman had this drawn

17:18.644 --> 17:21.050
all over his apartment
and tattooed on his body.

17:21.171 --> 17:24.527
It must have meant something to him
and clearly to John McFadden, as well.

17:24.646 --> 17:26.362
Do you have any idea what
it might mean?

17:26.482 --> 17:28.146
No, I'm sorry. I really wish I knew.

17:28.266 --> 17:29.573
Excuse me. Chief,

17:29.693 --> 17:32.255
John McFadden is nowhere on campus,
and according to his teacher,

17:32.375 --> 17:34.544
he went home sick after first period.

17:36.178 --> 17:38.321
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

17:40.272 --> 17:43.065
We're gonna end up evacuating
this whole city.

17:51.525 --> 17:52.525
So,

17:53.416 --> 17:55.507
all the neighbors are being told
there's a gas leak.

17:55.627 --> 17:57.042
So, everyone's going quietly.

17:57.162 --> 17:59.714
No sirens, no broadcasting, no commotion.
Was that made clear?

17:59.834 --> 18:01.302
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

18:01.670 --> 18:05.531
Sergeant, take off your sunglasses.
Just try and look less like a cop.

18:15.145 --> 18:16.434
- Mrs. McFadden?
- Yes.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.727
I'm Miss Johnson from OAK Valley west
high school, and this is Mr. Gabriel.

18:20.105 --> 18:21.395
You can call me David...

18:21.555 --> 18:24.815
Or Mr. G. Actually, that's what
the kids call me, it's hipper.

18:25.745 --> 18:28.110
Oh, Johnny never mentioned you.
What class do you teach?

18:28.442 --> 18:29.611
Chemistry.

18:29.771 --> 18:32.043
And we know that John's got
an awfully big test tomorrow,

18:32.163 --> 18:34.385
and we just want to make sure
that he has all the material.

18:35.084 --> 18:36.910
That is so nice of you.
Please come in.

18:37.070 --> 18:39.069
- Thank you.
- I should have called the school.

18:39.189 --> 18:41.304
Johnny came home early
with an upset stomach.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.266
I'll just go check
and make sure he's up.

18:43.386 --> 18:44.351
Johnny!

18:44.471 --> 18:47.180
- Lovely home you have, mrs. McFadden.
- Well, thank you.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.385
- Johnny?
- Yeah.

18:48.505 --> 18:50.507
Got some people here to see you.

18:56.168 --> 18:56.977
<i>Johnny?</i>

18:57.097 --> 18:59.696
<i>Wait, what are you people doing?
Johnny, are you okay?!</i>

18:59.816 --> 19:01.562
<i>Please, stop it! Who are you people?</i>

19:01.682 --> 19:02.682
Johnny?

19:02.888 --> 19:04.966
Oh, my god! Could you... stop it!

19:05.086 --> 19:06.467
- Show me your hands!
- Yeah.

19:06.587 --> 19:08.258
Don't move! Hands behind your back!

19:08.378 --> 19:10.285
- Yeah, you got me.
- What's happening? Johnny?

19:10.405 --> 19:12.321
Who are you people? What is going on?

19:12.481 --> 19:14.683
- We're the L.A.P.D please, calm down.
- Chief.

19:14.803 --> 19:17.346
- Oh, my god.
- Johnny, are you okay?

19:17.466 --> 19:19.163
Tell me what is going on here.

19:19.283 --> 19:20.887
Ma'am, we're taking your son downtown.

19:21.007 --> 19:23.342
You can come with us if you like.
This way, please.

19:29.946 --> 19:33.359
- Is the neighborhood totally evacuated?
- Everyone within a 10-block radius.

19:33.479 --> 19:35.198
Do you want to call in
the bomb squad?

19:35.318 --> 19:36.977
Have we found any bombs yet?

19:37.834 --> 19:39.269
- No.
- All right, then.

19:39.389 --> 19:42.731
Hey, chief, looks like Melman and
Johnny boy were planning armageddon.

19:42.851 --> 19:44.645
- Got bulletproof vests.
- We got guns.

19:44.805 --> 19:46.480
- Got big guns.
- Got ammo.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.803
- And propane tanks.
- So much for involved parents.

19:51.979 --> 19:54.755
Chief, there must be over a dozen
pipe bombs in here.

19:54.875 --> 19:57.335
Okay, now these are bombs!
Everybody out! Everybody out!

19:57.455 --> 19:59.277
Everybody out! Quickly! Come on!

20:00.170 --> 20:01.804
And somebody call Babs!

20:05.656 --> 20:06.484
Okay.

20:06.604 --> 20:08.667
Still haven't found
anything at the school.

20:08.787 --> 20:12.114
And John McFadden's old man
is on his way over here from work

20:12.234 --> 20:14.392
demanding an attorney for his boy.

20:14.643 --> 20:16.468
His boy is 18 years old and

20:16.588 --> 20:18.357
can ask for an attorney for himself.

20:18.477 --> 20:20.998
And if dad gives you any trouble,
you can arrest him

20:21.118 --> 20:23.966
for storing bombs and
illegal weapons in his garage.

20:24.086 --> 20:26.145
Yeah, well, mrs. McFadden said
they had "no idea"

20:26.265 --> 20:27.980
little Johnny was doing
that back there.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.524
Yeah, I'll tack on a charge
of felony stupidity.

20:30.847 --> 20:34.260
<i>Lieutenant, have you reminded
mr. McFadden of his rights?</i>

20:34.380 --> 20:35.380
<i>Sure have.</i>

20:35.765 --> 20:36.982
<i>Mr. McFadden...</i>

20:38.967 --> 20:40.793
You mind if I call you "John"?

20:41.070 --> 20:42.361
I've been called worse.

20:42.481 --> 20:44.598
Oh, yeah? What have people
been calling you?

20:53.164 --> 20:55.598
You went home sick from school today.

20:56.597 --> 20:58.819
Glad to see you got your appetite back.

21:02.048 --> 21:04.504
This kid is blissed out.
Did anybody check him for drugs?

21:04.624 --> 21:06.259
Well, you know how it goes in booking.

21:06.379 --> 21:09.390
Every suspect we bring in, we say,
"are you on anything?"

21:09.510 --> 21:11.481
Every suspect says, "no."

21:13.121 --> 21:15.291
Sure we can't get you
anything else to eat?

21:18.089 --> 21:20.206
You're a chocolate person.
So am I.

21:23.017 --> 21:25.433
We should, like,
get married or something.

21:27.699 --> 21:30.751
Well, we have to get to know
each other a little bit first.

21:31.322 --> 21:35.172
For example, you had a pretty serious
arsenal at your house.

21:35.767 --> 21:37.866
I have pipe bombs,
propane tanks, bullets,

21:37.986 --> 21:39.956
fuses, nails, automatic weapons.

21:40.076 --> 21:41.928
Where did you learn about all this?

21:42.768 --> 21:43.999
Not in school.

21:45.295 --> 21:47.020
I take it you don't like school?

21:47.288 --> 21:48.783
Oh, no, I love it.

21:49.608 --> 21:50.646
My favorite.

21:51.566 --> 21:54.450
If you don't want to tell me what
you were up to, maybe your parents will,

21:54.570 --> 21:55.952
when we arrest them.

21:56.072 --> 21:58.483
I mean, it was their garage, after all.

21:59.567 --> 22:02.279
My parents aren't smart enough
to understand what I'm doing.

22:02.399 --> 22:04.652
What about your friend Darren Melman?

22:08.619 --> 22:10.248
I don't know who that is.

22:10.973 --> 22:12.846
We have video of both of you

22:12.966 --> 22:16.302
buying your bomb-making materials
at home supply central.

22:19.249 --> 22:22.649
Like you, he had this...
tattooed on his arm.

22:23.036 --> 22:27.177
Or at least he did until this morning
when he exploded all over his apartment.

22:32.894 --> 22:36.233
- Melman was supposed to die anyway.
- Why's that?

22:43.233 --> 22:45.075
We could wait here all day.

22:52.305 --> 22:53.447
No, we can't.

22:54.825 --> 22:56.518
You're running out of time.

22:57.860 --> 23:00.797
I don't think I understand.
Who's running out of time?

23:00.917 --> 23:02.496
It's natural selection.

23:03.298 --> 23:04.428
Read your Darwin.

23:05.913 --> 23:07.040
Educate me.

23:07.725 --> 23:09.057
What does it say?

23:20.358 --> 23:22.863
- Are you guys recording this?
- Yes, we are.

23:23.865 --> 23:25.210
<i>Okay, check it out.</i>

23:27.656 --> 23:30.221
<i>The human race is an infestation
on this planet...</i>

23:30.341 --> 23:32.948
6.68 billion termites

23:33.068 --> 23:36.793
chewing up and spitting out resources,
choking on their own vomit.

23:38.122 --> 23:40.881
You know what the logical end
of this behavior is?

23:41.589 --> 23:42.774
Extinction.

23:43.922 --> 23:46.303
- And what's your role in all this?
- Mine?

23:48.873 --> 23:50.891
I am an agent of extinction.

23:52.059 --> 23:53.268
I am evolution's end.

23:54.124 --> 23:55.062
The double "E".

23:55.521 --> 23:58.203
Is that what this symbol means?
Evolution's end?

23:59.415 --> 24:02.486
You will learn about evolution's end
as you line up to die.

24:13.667 --> 24:15.386
I'm not afraid of death.

24:15.809 --> 24:17.657
I used to be, but not anymore.

24:17.777 --> 24:21.357
See, I didn't create...
I didn't create this bullshit world.

24:21.670 --> 24:24.675
I just want to do as much damage
as I can before I go.

24:25.342 --> 24:27.677
These are pretty big
evolutionary ideas, John.

24:28.356 --> 24:30.597
Radical, but not without merit.

24:30.757 --> 24:32.802
And people need to hear about them.

24:32.922 --> 24:35.412
But I don't think most everyone
will understand what all this means

24:35.532 --> 24:37.364
unless you explain it to them.

24:37.484 --> 24:39.280
What don't you... understand?

24:39.400 --> 24:41.901
Well, for example,
how you're planning on

24:42.021 --> 24:43.846
setting off the propane tanks.

24:43.966 --> 24:46.029
It's easy...
you just aim them and shoot.

24:47.857 --> 24:48.620
Boom!

24:50.656 --> 24:52.632
So that's evolution's end...
you and Darren Melman

24:52.752 --> 24:54.758
- killing some kids at school?
- No, no, no,

24:54.878 --> 24:56.605
you keep on reducing this to some

24:56.856 --> 24:59.676
minuscule high-school shooting,
but it's so much more than that.

24:59.796 --> 25:03.421
I'm talking about setting the record...
killing the most people ever.

25:04.310 --> 25:05.715
It's about inspiring others.

25:06.402 --> 25:09.427
Columbine was a great idea,
but they just didn't execute it right.

25:09.763 --> 25:10.724
We will!

25:13.425 --> 25:15.058
And people will remember us...

25:16.297 --> 25:17.940
as they line up to die.

25:19.073 --> 25:20.767
No one is going to die, John.

25:21.184 --> 25:23.402
Darren Melman is dead,
and you're in custody.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.735
Your plan is over... extinct!

25:27.605 --> 25:28.527
Now,

25:29.440 --> 25:32.364
the bad news is, is that you were caught
with a lot of bombs and guns,

25:32.484 --> 25:35.036
but the goods news is that you
haven't killed anyone yet.

25:35.518 --> 25:38.960
So all you have to do is tell us
what you and Darren Melman

25:39.080 --> 25:41.903
were planning, and I'll
get you some help.

25:44.822 --> 25:46.267
I already told you.

25:47.498 --> 25:49.598
And now you're running out of time.

25:49.718 --> 25:51.261
Time to do what?

25:58.542 --> 26:00.221
Have you planted a bomb?

26:05.173 --> 26:08.737
- What were we talking about?
- Is there a bomb somewhere, on a timer?

26:11.608 --> 26:13.651
No, it's natural selection.
Read your Darwin.

26:13.771 --> 26:16.077
Okay, John, you already said that.
I want you to listen to me.

26:16.237 --> 26:18.721
I want you to focus!
Where are the bombs?!

26:18.993 --> 26:20.716
You're running out of time.

26:23.621 --> 26:24.948
<i>Are you on drugs?</i>

26:27.791 --> 26:28.894
Look at me!

26:32.615 --> 26:33.382
John!

26:33.502 --> 26:34.830
Don't go anywhere, John!

26:34.950 --> 26:36.599
<i>Stay with me, John! John!</i>

26:36.719 --> 26:37.463
<i>John!</i>

26:37.583 --> 26:40.677
Mrs. McFadden, is your son
taking any prescription drugs?

26:41.125 --> 26:43.013
Yes. He's... he's clinically depressed.

26:43.133 --> 26:44.650
- Why?
- OK, what drugs is he on?

26:44.770 --> 26:46.314
- Is he OK?
- What is he taking?!

26:46.434 --> 26:48.661
Some sort of MAO inhibitor.
I can't remember the name.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.316
- Is Johnny all right?
- Chief, something's happening here.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.823
What's going on? Where is he?

26:54.291 --> 26:57.244
John! Come on, John!
Come on, John!

26:57.404 --> 26:59.120
He had a seizure and just dropped.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.436
Come on, stay with us, John!
Stay with me!

27:01.556 --> 27:03.902
- Wake up! Come on, John!
- I have the defibrillator.

27:04.022 --> 27:06.643
- Here we go.
- Come on, buddy, stay with us.

27:06.951 --> 27:09.143
- Stay with us, Johnny. Come on, buddy.
<i>- Okay.</i>

27:09.263 --> 27:10.067
Clear.

27:10.959 --> 27:12.626
Check his pulse, check his pulse.

27:12.746 --> 27:13.950
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

27:14.070 --> 27:14.838
Clear.

27:15.309 --> 27:18.014
Come on, Johnny! Stay with us, Johnny!
Clear!

27:20.594 --> 27:22.642
Well, it didn't take long.

27:23.188 --> 27:26.897
The McFaddens' attorney is accusing us
of killing their son while in custody.

27:27.409 --> 27:30.136
I'm moving the autopsy
to the top of the line.

27:30.256 --> 27:32.779
And the coroner will only tell
them what we already know...

27:32.939 --> 27:35.285
that their son overdosed
on an MAO inhibitor

27:35.405 --> 27:38.034
that turns lethal
when mixed with chocolate.

27:38.194 --> 27:40.086
He blew himself up,
just like his friend.

27:40.206 --> 27:43.023
The drug was the explosive.
The chocolate was the detonator.

27:43.143 --> 27:45.997
But did he leave another bomb somewhere
with another detonator?

27:46.117 --> 27:48.952
Do we have all the guns?
Where did they come from?

27:49.072 --> 27:50.529
Okay, it's a total...

27:50.649 --> 27:51.960
a total long shot,

27:52.080 --> 27:54.788
but there is a sporting-goods store

27:54.908 --> 27:57.804
at the shopping mall where the kids
bought the bomb-making materials.

27:57.924 --> 28:00.430
We could check their receipts...
see if the kids have a record

28:00.550 --> 28:03.348
- of purchasing weapons there.
- Haven't found a thing at the school,

28:03.468 --> 28:05.138
and we've torn that apart.

28:07.675 --> 28:10.054
Oh, great. Thank you so much.

28:10.553 --> 28:11.708
My clothes.

28:12.146 --> 28:14.249
Okay, but John mentioned
Columbine for a reason.

28:14.369 --> 28:16.026
It must have been part of their plan.

28:16.146 --> 28:18.094
The Columbine plan didn't work.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.196
Really? How so?

28:20.316 --> 28:23.250
The shooters planted propane tanks
inside the school.

28:23.615 --> 28:25.117
The plan was...

28:25.407 --> 28:28.084
to blow up the tanks
and force the survivors outside

28:28.244 --> 28:30.754
where they could be picked off
by rifle fire.

28:30.914 --> 28:33.385
When the tanks didn't explode,
the shooters went inside the school.

28:33.505 --> 28:37.260
All I'm saying's, as horrible as it was,
the original plan didn't work.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.621
If it had, it could have
been even worse.

28:39.741 --> 28:42.020
Morning, everyone. Congratulations.

28:43.017 --> 28:43.942
What for?

28:44.848 --> 28:46.483
For... preventing what

28:46.603 --> 28:48.855
could have been a horrible massacre
at a public high school.

28:49.015 --> 28:50.827
I'm headed there now
for a press conference.

28:50.947 --> 28:52.875
Wait, wait, wait.
I think it's much too early

28:52.995 --> 28:55.264
to say for certain
that the threat is over.

28:55.384 --> 28:57.051
- Why?
- Because we...

28:57.703 --> 28:59.895
found more propane tanks
than we have receipts for,

29:00.015 --> 29:03.698
and we don't know how many guns
these boys had to begin with, and...

29:03.818 --> 29:06.457
"you're running out of time."
That's what John Mcfadden kept saying

29:06.577 --> 29:09.028
before he died. "You're running out
of time", and I never found out

29:09.148 --> 29:10.647
- what he meant.
- Well,

29:10.870 --> 29:13.079
sure you did. He'd taken
a lethal dose of his medication.

29:13.199 --> 29:16.126
He was minutes from lapsing into
cardiac arrest, and he knew it.

29:16.246 --> 29:18.328
But what if that's not what he meant?

29:18.448 --> 29:19.996
So, to be clear,

29:20.116 --> 29:23.076
you're basing your misgivings about
the success of this investigation

29:23.196 --> 29:26.099
on the fact that you have...
too much evidence

29:26.219 --> 29:28.844
and on the testimony
of a clinically depressed kid

29:28.964 --> 29:30.728
in a drug-induced delirium.

29:30.848 --> 29:34.074
Sir, I... I think what
chief Johnson is saying

29:34.194 --> 29:36.768
is that she'd like more time
to tie up some loose ends

29:36.888 --> 29:38.558
before we go to press.

29:38.678 --> 29:41.316
And all I'm asking is,
"what loose ends?"

29:41.436 --> 29:43.888
Like how and where they purchased
their guns, and

29:44.008 --> 29:47.152
- where they got their ammunition...
- I'm not saying stop investigating.

29:47.272 --> 29:49.834
Start your after-action report
right now.

29:50.857 --> 29:51.668
And...

29:51.982 --> 29:52.907
listen...

29:53.027 --> 29:55.588
I know. It's been a rough
couple of days.

29:56.410 --> 29:57.757
Two young men died.

29:57.877 --> 30:00.410
One of them died right here
in this building.

30:00.530 --> 30:03.765
But whatever these boys were planning,
you stopped them...

30:04.964 --> 30:06.924
which is why I need
to do this press conference.

30:07.044 --> 30:09.942
We've all taken a few on the chin
from the media around here recently.

30:10.062 --> 30:13.314
And for once, I get to talk
about something we did right.

30:13.474 --> 30:16.526
Our new Major Crimes Division
is working! Thank God.

30:17.452 --> 30:20.191
At the end of the day,
this is a big win for us.

30:20.728 --> 30:22.320
So, congratulations.

30:34.494 --> 30:36.164
Flynn, check this out.

30:36.284 --> 30:38.509
You could fit a whole person
in this thing.

30:38.629 --> 30:41.032
Yeah, remind me not to come
to your house for a barbecue.

30:41.152 --> 30:44.053
- Yeah, like I'd invite you.
- Like you could cook.

30:49.343 --> 30:51.085
So, could you use the computer

30:51.205 --> 30:54.336
to pull up any receipts for Darren
Melman, going back about three months?

30:54.456 --> 30:55.257
Yeah.

30:55.751 --> 30:56.978
I could do that.

30:57.251 --> 30:59.402
You could. That's great.
Thanks, Keith.

31:00.316 --> 31:03.698
And if I gave you credit-card numbers
for John McFadden and his parents,

31:03.858 --> 31:07.131
would you pull up receipts for them
during the same time period?

31:07.251 --> 31:09.446
Just let me get the key
from my manager.

31:09.566 --> 31:10.844
That's great.

31:11.297 --> 31:13.019
Just got to get the key.

31:19.309 --> 31:21.116
- Are you bored?
- Actually,

31:21.678 --> 31:24.306
- I'm thinking about wallpaper.
- Ugh, things are bad enough

31:24.426 --> 31:25.976
without shopping.

31:27.256 --> 31:30.183
You guys sure the propane tanks
you found were from our store?

31:30.343 --> 31:33.364
You know, we're not, actually. We're
just trying to account for everything.

31:33.484 --> 31:35.533
Would you know if any tanks
were stolen from here?

31:35.653 --> 31:37.445
I could tell you pretty fast
if they were.

31:37.565 --> 31:39.655
Our system keeps track
of every item in stock.

31:39.775 --> 31:41.680
- Do you want me to go check?
- Oh, could you?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.546
- I'd really appreciate that.
- No prob.

31:43.666 --> 31:46.913
And, Frank, I believe
that there's a sporting-goods store

31:47.033 --> 31:49.786
in the mall that sells guns.
Can you tell me where that might be?

31:50.096 --> 31:52.887
Yeah. Go into the mall,
then up the broken escalator.

31:53.116 --> 31:54.749
Stay right. You can't miss it.

31:54.909 --> 31:56.869
Thank you. Stay right.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.234
Stay to the right.

32:05.461 --> 32:08.917
- This is why I hate shopping malls.
- Look, here's the directory.

32:09.103 --> 32:10.388
Okay.

32:10.931 --> 32:13.257
"You are here." That much we know.

32:13.377 --> 32:15.781
And the sporting-goods store is...

32:16.105 --> 32:18.074
- over there.
- Okay.

32:18.194 --> 32:21.551
I also think there's a place here
to get wallpaper. So...

32:21.936 --> 32:24.344
- if you don't mind, I'm gonna...
- Oh...

32:28.250 --> 32:29.035
What?

32:44.572 --> 32:46.543
The school's not the target.

32:48.129 --> 32:49.926
We're in the target.

33:09.396 --> 33:11.853
Chief, SWAT team is
setting up fast as they can.

33:11.973 --> 33:14.029
We should hear helicopters
in less than 10 minutes.

33:14.149 --> 33:17.208
We may not have 10 minutes, Lieutenant.
Move the rollout along, please.

33:17.328 --> 33:19.207
Chief, Keith says that the propane tanks

33:19.327 --> 33:21.065
are kept in a locked cage
behind the store

33:21.185 --> 33:24.033
- and Frank's the only one with the key.
- He didn't tell me that.

33:24.153 --> 33:25.840
Let me see your arms now!

33:31.739 --> 33:33.426
Have you ever seen this?

33:33.767 --> 33:36.225
Yeah, man, Frank's got that
tattooed on his arm.

33:36.345 --> 33:38.124
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Look at this.

33:38.244 --> 33:40.521
Melman, McFadden,
and this other kid, Frank, right?

33:40.681 --> 33:42.655
Three kids, three stars.

33:42.775 --> 33:45.575
Maybe these points show us where
each kid was gonna position himself.

33:45.695 --> 33:49.104
And the propane tanks were arranged so
that when they were shot and exploded,

33:49.224 --> 33:51.021
it would push the people
out the exits.

33:51.141 --> 33:53.504
And if Frank is still here
and sticking to the plan at all,

33:53.624 --> 33:56.500
maybe we find him
at one of these three points, no?

33:56.620 --> 33:58.623
High ground or... the roof.

33:58.783 --> 34:00.583
But if the propane tanks
aren't exploding,

34:00.743 --> 34:02.710
how is he gonna get people
to run out of here?

34:03.533 --> 34:05.252
- Do we evacuate?
- No, no, no.

34:05.899 --> 34:08.585
Let's all spread out
and start looking for Frank.

34:09.793 --> 34:10.641
Yes, hello?

34:10.761 --> 34:12.666
Why did you pull the bomb squad
from the school?

34:12.786 --> 34:15.460
And you've asked for all available
units and air support?

34:15.580 --> 34:17.538
The school is not the target.
It's the mall.

34:17.658 --> 34:19.745
<i>And there's a third boy involved.</i>

34:20.797 --> 34:23.081
- Are you sure?
- He could start shooting at any time,

34:23.202 --> 34:25.178
I don't know where he is
or if we found everything

34:25.297 --> 34:27.360
- they were planning to detonate.
- Chief! Chief!

34:33.731 --> 34:35.136
What's happening?

34:35.255 --> 34:36.183
Brenda?

34:38.047 --> 34:39.996
I can't talk now. Just send help.

34:42.672 --> 34:44.960
- How do you get to the roof?
- There and there.

34:45.121 --> 34:47.656
Okay, lt. Provenza, dt. Sanchez,
you go that way.

34:47.775 --> 34:50.068
- I'm coming with you.
- Fine. Lt Flynn, sgt Gabriel,

34:50.188 --> 34:53.320
come with us. We'll split up on the roof
and surround him.

34:53.592 --> 34:57.259
It's starting. Lt. Tao, dt. Daniels,
keep people inside!

34:57.379 --> 35:00.255
Stay away from the door!
Sir, step in!

35:00.375 --> 35:01.936
This is only a drill!

35:02.304 --> 35:04.315
L.A.P.D! I need you to step back!

35:04.435 --> 35:06.293
I need you to go back
in the mall!

35:21.986 --> 35:23.571
Get her out of here!

35:47.471 --> 35:48.858
Son of a bitch!

35:55.756 --> 35:57.832
- Are you okay, sir?
- Fine, fine.

36:04.599 --> 36:07.120
Check your guns.
Check your extra mags.

36:08.858 --> 36:09.796
You ready?

36:09.916 --> 36:11.339
Yeah. Good luck.

36:12.011 --> 36:13.102
Good luck.

36:14.517 --> 36:16.844
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

36:23.011 --> 36:23.898
Bastard!

36:56.770 --> 36:57.776
Be careful.

37:59.774 --> 38:00.588
Julio!

38:12.382 --> 38:13.210
Stop!

38:18.572 --> 38:21.487
Keep firing on him!
He's not going down!

38:31.789 --> 38:33.380
- You okay?!
- Yeah, I'm okay.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.358
- I'm okay. You okay!
- Good!

38:35.518 --> 38:37.742
Head shots! Head shots!

38:43.192 --> 38:44.474
I only got one mag.

38:44.594 --> 38:45.643
Shoot slow.

39:14.001 --> 39:16.273
Shoot the bag! Shoot the bag!

40:12.907 --> 40:14.765
He took three hits.
Probably a collapsed lung.

40:14.885 --> 40:17.752
Now you get him to the nearest
trauma center. Losing blood fast!

40:17.912 --> 40:19.634
Get him in! Get him in now!

40:20.707 --> 40:22.691
- You'll be okay, Julio.
- Okay, let's go!

40:24.585 --> 40:25.418
Easy.

40:26.134 --> 40:27.549
I'm going with him.

40:27.669 --> 40:30.330
- Sir!
- Take it easy, Julio. Take it easy.

40:30.450 --> 40:32.103
- Sir.
- What is it, son?

40:32.223 --> 40:34.018
- You ran.
- What?

40:34.320 --> 40:36.246
You ran! You never run!

40:39.873 --> 40:41.509
Go! Go! Go!

40:44.230 --> 40:45.277
Let's go!

41:02.514 --> 41:05.168
Detective Sanchez, listen to me!

41:05.509 --> 41:07.093
I'm issuing you a direct order.

41:07.781 --> 41:10.175
Keep breathing! Do you hear me?!

41:10.634 --> 41:12.100
Keep breathing!

41:13.305 --> 41:19.408
