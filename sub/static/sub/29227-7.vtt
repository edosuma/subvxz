<i>Previously on</i> The Affair...

00:05.964 --> 00:07.299
I don't want to have to pay
the rent by myself every month.

00:07.382 --> 00:10.135
Let's just go get married
at city hall tonight.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.970
I want a wedding,
at my grandparents' house.

00:12.054 --> 00:13.931
Whitney, this marriage thing,

00:14.014 --> 00:15.307
you don't have to do it,
you know.

00:15.390 --> 00:16.225
But, actually, Dad, I do,
because if I don't,

00:16.308 --> 00:18.560
then Colin has to leave
the country.

00:18.644 --> 00:22.397
I'm desperate for a date
to my opening tomorrow.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.733
- Dashiell Boucicault.
‐ Hi.

00:24.816 --> 00:26.818
<i>He likes to watch.</i>

00:26.902 --> 00:29.738
<i>He could give you a gallery.</i>

00:29.821 --> 00:30.864
‐ I'm married.
‐Thank you

00:30.948 --> 00:32.406
for finally telling me.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.535
‐That's it?
‐What do you want me to say?

00:34.618 --> 00:35.494
Doesn't matter.
You love me, too.

00:35.577 --> 00:39.081
Oh, it does matter.
And I don't forgive you.

00:39.164 --> 00:41.583
And how can I tell you I love
you? I don't even know you.

‐Noah.
‐Margaret.

‐Where's Helen?
‐Oh, I told you, Grandma.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.720
She couldn't come.
She had to work.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.097
Well, that's just disgusting.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.932
I don't think so.

03:44.015 --> 03:44.850
Well, of course it is.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.726
This is your wedding.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.438
What could be more important
than your wedding, Whitney?

03:49.521 --> 03:51.648
I swear I brought
your mother up better than that.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.859
I really did.

03:53.942 --> 03:56.069
Oh, well.
She's a lost cause.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.738
You're my only hope
for happiness now.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.282
Ugh. Come upstairs.

04:00.365 --> 04:02.993
I've laid out
all the bridal magazines.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.953
Noah, take Whitney's things
to the blue room.

04:05.036 --> 04:06.204
You're in the basement.

04:06.288 --> 04:08.248
Oh, and see if you can
find Bruce.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.083
He'd be thrilled to see you.

04:15.881 --> 04:19.843
Hey. Hey, Bruce.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.262
‐Hi.
‐H‐Hello.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.349
Who are you?

04:26.433 --> 04:29.186
Uh, Noah.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.938
Noah. N‐Noah Solloway?

04:32.022 --> 04:34.274
‐I'm your ex‐‐
‐Oh, oh. Yes, of course.

04:34.357 --> 04:34.775
I'm so sorry.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.985
Uh, Bruce Butler.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.488
Margaret told me
you were coming.

04:39.571 --> 04:41.156
The writer. Uh...

04:41.239 --> 04:42.866
She says you've published
multiple books.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.367
That's right, yeah.

04:44.451 --> 04:46.495
Wow, that's impressive.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.664
Uh, you know,
there's a great expression.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.875
Uh...

04:51.958 --> 04:55.504
"No one has one book
in him, but..."

04:55.587 --> 04:57.172
Um. It's, uh...

04:57.255 --> 04:59.508
I think it's,
"Everyone has one book in them.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.510
Almost nobody has two."

05:02.928 --> 05:06.723
Oh. Uh... That's not very nice.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.684
Uh, you know,
I always wanted to be a writer.

05:09.768 --> 05:13.271
But there never seemed
to be enough hours in the day.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.606
Yeah...

05:14.689 --> 05:17.150
Are you hungry?
I was craving some, uh,

05:17.234 --> 05:19.319
some of these, uh...

05:19.402 --> 05:20.695
‐ some of these...
‐ Here.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.239
Bruce, let‐let me
make those for you.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.907
No. No, no, you're our guest.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.160
You know... No, no.
You... have‐have some coffee.

05:27.244 --> 05:31.414
Uh, uh, I have no idea
how to use that machine.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.166
Sure, I'll make some.

05:33.250 --> 05:37.546
Um, are you, uh, you married?

05:39.422 --> 05:42.551
Uh, no. Divorced.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.427
Twice, actually.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.514
Well, that's probably why
you have so much time to write.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.559
I'm more of
a family man, myself.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.060
Bruce, no.

05:52.143 --> 05:54.145
‐ Oh...
‐Oh, Jesus.

05:56.815 --> 05:57.615
- ‐It's okay.
- ‐

05:57.649 --> 06:00.193
‐No...
‐I just, I just wanted to‐‐

06:00.277 --> 06:02.445
It's‐it's all right,
it's all right. Shh, shh.

06:02.529 --> 06:06.825
We're trying
to set boundaries for Bruce.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.708
Some new expectations.

06:07.784 --> 06:09.494
While you're here,
I'd appreciate it

06:09.578 --> 06:10.412
if you could help with that.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.622
I'm sorry.
I didn't... I didn't know.

06:12.706 --> 06:13.915
Well, now you do.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.294
Hi.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.796
Ah.
What are you doing here?

06:19.880 --> 06:23.717
‐I'm getting married.
‐What? To this fellow?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.261
Why, Helly‐Belly,
that's fantastic.

06:26.344 --> 06:28.013
Does this mean that
you've finally broken up

06:28.096 --> 06:29.931
with that kid from Pennsylvania?

06:30.015 --> 06:30.974
The‐the one that
was practically a mute?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.893
Bruce, t‐this is Whitney.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.187
Helen is your daughter.
This is your granddaughter.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.106
G‐Granddaughter?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.941
I can't do this anymore.

06:40.025 --> 06:40.901
It's okay.
Margaret, it's okay.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.485
Let's‐let's focus
on the wedding. Uh...

06:42.569 --> 06:44.362
Whitney has this huge agenda
for us,

06:44.446 --> 06:46.323
and, uh, she needs your help.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.866
Uh, that's right, Grandma.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.493
Um, I need to decide
on a florist.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.953
I've narrowed it down to three,

06:52.037 --> 06:53.455
but I'm sure
you'll have an opinion.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.124
Um, I need to
figure out a caterer.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.043
I wanted to find somebody
who could do vegan options.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.044
I don't know if you know
anybody.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.212
And, um... Oh, well,
we already got a tent.

07:01.296 --> 07:03.214
Oh, that reminds me.

07:03.298 --> 07:04.549
The bill for the tent came.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.803
Margaret, I'm...

07:08.887 --> 07:09.846
I thought I was doing
the catering,

07:09.929 --> 07:12.349
and you and Bruce were
gonna pay for the tent.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.727
Noah, we can't pay for this.
It's $20,000.

07:16.478 --> 07:18.647
We don't have any money.

07:18.730 --> 07:20.857
And whose fault
is that, Marie Antoinette?

07:22.942 --> 07:25.570
Whitney,
I just had a splendid idea.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.407
Why don't I call Dean
at our tennis club?

07:29.491 --> 07:30.200
They do a marvelous brunch.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.035
And if we do
the wedding reception

07:32.118 --> 07:34.704
outside of peak hours,

07:34.788 --> 07:36.331
I'm sure we can get a discount

07:36.414 --> 07:37.749
on the cabana.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.000
They have a waffle station

07:39.084 --> 07:42.170
and a make‐your‐own‐omelette
bar.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.089
Excuse me, please.

07:47.634 --> 07:51.179
Okay, M‐Margaret, the‐the
wedding is happening here.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.348
Okay? So, if you want
to help,

07:53.431 --> 07:56.851
help us figure out
a way to make that happen.

07:58.853 --> 08:01.690
Hey.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.529
We can't afford a wedding,
can we?

08:07.612 --> 08:09.030
No one can afford a wedding.
Not really.

08:09.114 --> 08:11.533
We can figure it out.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.618
No, I‐I need
to get back to reality.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.078
I... Work has been crazy.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.538
I had to miss three days
to be here.

08:16.621 --> 08:19.374
Andrea already wants
to fucking kill me.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.128
It's fine. We'll just...
we'll get married at city hall.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.213
Come on, Whitney. You've been
talking about having a wedding

08:25.296 --> 08:26.715
in this house since
before you were in braces.

08:26.798 --> 08:28.133
I already found a red‐eye
that we can get on tonight.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.135
It has seats available.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.095
Give me six hours.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.513
Okay? Let's at least try.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.224
Then if you still
want to go to city hall,

08:36.307 --> 08:37.808
then we'll go to city hall.

08:37.892 --> 08:40.477
Come on. Have you got a pen?

08:45.316 --> 08:47.652
Right.
What's the first thing?

08:47.736 --> 08:49.404
‐Um...
‐Tent.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.740
Okay, I just received
the last part of my advance,

08:51.823 --> 08:54.117
and I can't think of a better
thing to spend it on.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.410
‐Dad, no.
‐So that's that done.

08:55.493 --> 08:57.662
‐Next?
‐Dad, you don't get it.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.582
A‐A tent is no good if you don't
have things to put in it.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.917
Backyard weddings are so
expensive because you have

09:03.001 --> 09:06.546
to pay for every single
little thing. See?

09:07.047 --> 09:10.300
Okay.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.343
Let's start with plates.

09:14.179 --> 09:16.347
Well, this house
has got to have plenty of those.

09:16.431 --> 09:18.641
<i>I always hoped</i>

09:18.725 --> 09:21.269
your mother would inherit this,

09:21.352 --> 09:23.229
but she insists
on feeding you all

09:23.313 --> 09:25.690
from earthenware as if
she grew up on a riverbank.

09:25.774 --> 09:27.442
But no matter,

09:27.525 --> 09:29.277
because now it'll go to someone
who appreciates it.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.155
‐Thank you, Grandma.
‐This is helpful.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.948
Thanks. What's next?

09:34.032 --> 09:36.618
Oh, I have an appointment at
an East Hampton bridal boutique

09:36.701 --> 09:38.620
at two,
but it's crazy expensive.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.539
‐I think we should cancel it.
‐You don't have a dress yet?

09:41.623 --> 09:43.333
Perfect. Come on, let's go.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.216
Oh, Margaret,
can we borrow your car?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.128
Only if Whitney drives.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.297
‐Why?
‐Because the last time you drove

09:49.380 --> 09:51.800
a car in Montauk,
you killed Scott Lockhart.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.311
So, what do you want
to do about music?

10:03.394 --> 10:05.480
You want dancing, right?

10:05.563 --> 10:07.690
Honestly, I kind of wanted
a flash mob.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.193
‐What?
‐You know, a flash mob?

10:10.276 --> 10:12.821
It's, like, a surprise dance,
but everyone knows the steps.

10:12.904 --> 10:16.157
How could everybody know
the steps to a surprise dance?

10:16.241 --> 10:17.575
Because somebody teaches them
ahead of time,

10:17.659 --> 10:20.453
and it's like a... Never mind.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.833
Oh, look.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.961
We have to stop

10:28.044 --> 10:29.963
and see what they've done
to the Lobster Roll.

10:30.046 --> 10:30.922
No, Whit‐Whitney,
we don't have time.

10:31.005 --> 10:33.800
Yes, we do. Come on.
It'll be hilarious.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.908
Hi, we okay here?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.455
Not as friendly
as they used to be.

11:04.539 --> 11:06.207
Yeah.

11:10.837 --> 11:14.424
Hey, remember when Stacey
almost choked and Mom saved her?

11:14.507 --> 11:15.717
What?

11:15.800 --> 11:18.344
Yeah, you remember.
We were sitting right there,

11:18.428 --> 11:20.388
and Trevor and Stacey were
playing that game, and then

11:20.471 --> 11:21.806
Stacey put a marble
in her mouth.

11:21.890 --> 11:25.226
No, it wasn't, uh, it wasn't
your mom who saved her.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.478
It was, it was Alison.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.397
What?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.399
No, that's‐that's not
how I remember it at all.

11:31.482 --> 11:32.734
No, I'm pretty sure it was her.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.861
Stacey was choking
and Alison was right there.

11:40.742 --> 11:43.494
So, was that the day
you met Alison?

11:44.412 --> 11:46.706
Yeah, I think it was.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.793
So you bonded over the fact that
Stacey almost choked to death?

11:52.629 --> 11:53.630
Whitney, if you ever want
to talk about what happened

11:53.713 --> 11:55.715
‐between Alison and me...
‐Yeah.

11:55.798 --> 11:56.925
Sure. I do, actually. Go ahead.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.597
Well, there's not... I didn't
exactly have a prepared speech.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.806
‐But if you‐‐
‐Yeah. That's what I thought.

12:03.890 --> 12:04.474
No, I mean, if you want
to ask questions or‐‐

12:04.557 --> 12:07.560
- ‐Stop.
- ‐ Noah?

12:08.519 --> 12:10.063
Luisa, hi.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.648
‐Hey.
‐Hey, you remember Whitney,

12:11.731 --> 12:14.275
‐my daughter?
‐Yeah, of course. Uh...

12:14.359 --> 12:15.610
I babysat you one summer
at the Butlers'.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.278
I remember. Nice to see you.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.863
Yeah, we're in town planning
Whitney's wedding,

12:18.947 --> 12:20.448
if you can believe it.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.409
Cool. Congratulations.

12:23.493 --> 12:25.161
Thank you.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.372
So this is different.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.834
Yeah. It's officially in the
hands of the new owners now.

12:31.918 --> 12:34.337
I just came by to empty
a few things out of the office.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.172
Ah. End of an era.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.925
Yep.

12:40.843 --> 12:42.470
I have to get going.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.764
What's, uh, what's next for you?

12:44.847 --> 12:47.267
I'm going back to New York.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.309
‐Really?
‐Mm‐hmm.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.394
Wow.

12:49.477 --> 12:52.438
I can't believe you got Cole
to go to the city.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.942
We're separated, Noah.

12:56.025 --> 12:58.152
He and Joanie
are moving to Vermont.

12:58.236 --> 13:01.823
This afternoon, actually,
so I have to get going.

13:01.906 --> 13:02.991
Congratulations on
your wedding. Good luck.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.955
I'll be right back.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.039
No, Dad, she doesn't
want to talk to us.

13:14.252 --> 13:15.670
Hey, Luisa.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.171
I'm sorry
if I offended you there.

13:17.255 --> 13:20.174
‐I had no idea.
‐It's fine.

13:20.258 --> 13:21.843
That's terrible
about you and Cole.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.096
Well, the writing
was on the wall, wasn't it?

13:25.179 --> 13:28.850
Look, I was wondering, have you
any idea when they're leaving?

13:28.933 --> 13:31.728
‐Why?
‐'Cause I want to see Joanie.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.980
You can't just waltz
in and out of her life

13:34.063 --> 13:36.024
‐when it's convenient.
‐I know that. I know that.

13:36.107 --> 13:39.319
I raised her as my own for
two years. I care about her.

13:39.402 --> 13:40.320
Noah, I don't feel like getting

13:40.403 --> 13:42.363
‐in the middle of this.
‐No, I understand.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.032
If you could just tell me
when they're leaving,

13:44.115 --> 13:46.075
then I can swing by, and if Cole
doesn't want me to see her,

13:46.159 --> 13:47.660
that's fine, I just,
I don't want her to think

13:47.744 --> 13:49.162
I just disappeared.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.248
They're leaving at five.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.875
Thanks.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.920
I'm sorry about
how it turned out here, and...

13:58.004 --> 13:59.005
I hope there are
good things ahead.

14:00.882 --> 14:03.843
Noah, I babysat your kids.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.137
My mother worked at your house.

14:06.220 --> 14:07.930
Don't pretend we're friends.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.870
‐Hey, can I get a menu, please?
‐You order on that.

Hey... you think these
would look good in a bouquet?

15:14.705 --> 15:16.916
Uh, you know th...
that's poison ivy, right?

15:16.999 --> 15:19.168
‐This is not poison ivy.
‐Not the stuff you got in your hand, man.

15:19.252 --> 15:22.421
The three‐leafed plants that are
all around where you were

15:22.505 --> 15:23.798
‐secret gardening.
‐W... N...

15:23.881 --> 15:24.799
Poison ivy doesn't grow
in the winter.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.343
Oh, yeah.
It definitely does.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.555
Oh, fuck.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.647
Yay.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.357
‐Are you Mr. Solloway?
‐Yeah. Hi.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.694
Yeah, they told me at the front
that Whitney might be back here.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.071
‐She sure is. Welcome.
‐Thank you.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.035
‐ Hi, Dad.
‐Hey, Whit. How's it going?

15:53.119 --> 15:54.078
Good.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.830
Oh, thanks.

15:55.913 --> 15:57.540
It is so cute that you're here.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.959
We almost never see dads
in the shop.

16:00.042 --> 16:03.004
- ‐What do you do?
- ‐ He's a writer.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.839
Ooh. Anything I'd know?

16:04.922 --> 16:06.924
- ‐I doubt it.
- ‐ He's being very

16:07.008 --> 16:09.302
modest. He has
a movie coming out

16:09.385 --> 16:11.012
‐starring Sasha Mann.
‐Sasha Mann?

16:11.095 --> 16:14.515
I fucking <i>love</i> Sasha Mann, wow.

16:14.599 --> 16:15.850
Hey, Hannah,
could you come back here

16:15.933 --> 16:16.434
and give me a hand
with these clamps?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.352
Coming.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.993
Okay...

16:56.766 --> 16:59.644
Well?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.230
What do you think?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.776
Oh, Whit.

17:06.858 --> 17:07.659
You're beautiful.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.529
Thanks, Dad.

17:10.613 --> 17:14.242
You guys are gonna make
the cutest father‐daughter ever.

17:14.325 --> 17:16.786
Wow. Whitney, it's 19,

17:16.868 --> 17:19.413
but I'll knock it down to 17
because it's...

17:19.497 --> 17:21.457
it's just so...
it's perfect.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.042
Uh, wh... That's, uh...

17:24.126 --> 17:25.127
17, as in thousand?

17:25.211 --> 17:29.298
Mm, sometimes dads
just need a little convincing.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.424
Do you mind pulling
a few less expensive

17:30.508 --> 17:33.261
options?

17:33.344 --> 17:36.722
Uh, Lizzie! Can you
come here a second?

17:36.806 --> 17:39.600
Oh... sweetheart.

17:39.684 --> 17:44.647
You are front‐cover
Martha‐Stewart gorgeous.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.190
- ‐Isn't it perfect?
- ‐ Mm‐hm.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.109
Whitney thinks so, too.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.611
Actually, I was wondering if you
could pull some cheaper options?

17:50.695 --> 17:51.988
Ah, she is such a doll.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.614
Is she your first
to get married?

17:53.698 --> 17:55.783
Yeah. Yeah.

17:55.866 --> 17:59.036
Okay. So, like, what price range
were you thinking?

17:59.120 --> 18:00.913
Uh... Wh...
I‐I don't know, I‐I‐‐

18:00.997 --> 18:02.873
He's a big screenwriter.

18:02.957 --> 18:06.335
He works with Sasha Mann.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.962
Really?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.505
Let me ask you something,
Mr. Hollywood.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.882
When will there ever be
a more important time

18:11.966 --> 18:13.884
to splurge than for your
eldest daughter's wedding?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.971
She loves this dress.

18:17.054 --> 18:21.642
Uh... Look, maybe...
maybe I can, um...

18:21.726 --> 18:22.643
‐ Maybe...
‐ Don't, Dad.

18:22.727 --> 18:23.561
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm gonna change.

18:23.644 --> 18:27.023
I'm sorry, what,
what's happening here?

18:27.106 --> 18:28.107
I didn't know the dresses
were this expensive. I...

18:28.190 --> 18:30.776
I haven't earned
that kind of money yet.

18:30.860 --> 18:32.903
Well, then why did you waste
our time with this appointment?

18:32.987 --> 18:35.489
It was my idea, Hannah,
and it was a big mistake.

18:35.573 --> 18:39.452
What kind of psycho
spends $17,000 on a dress?

18:39.535 --> 18:40.453
Do you know how many
clean water wells

18:40.536 --> 18:42.204
you could build in Africa
with that money?

18:42.288 --> 18:46.042
‐No. Do <i>you?</i>
‐I bet it's a lot, you cunt.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.295
Nice work, Dad.

19:02.016 --> 19:04.769
Dad... what's up
with the itching?

19:04.852 --> 19:06.896
It's fucking...

19:06.979 --> 19:09.857
‐poison ivy.
‐What?

19:09.940 --> 19:12.276
Yeah, I tried to pick you
some wildflowers.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.070
Thought you might like them.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.204
What?

19:23.287 --> 19:26.499
I know what you're trying to do.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.917
And I appreciate it.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.252
What am I trying to do?

19:32.380 --> 19:34.173
You're trying to make amends.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.891
Oh, look, a daytime moon.

19:43.974 --> 19:47.311
Your mom always used to say
they were good luck.

‐Who sings that?
‐I don't know.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.753
Colin's always playing it,
it stuck in my head.

20:12.837 --> 20:15.631
It was the Waterboys.
That's <i>my</i> generation.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.843
Yeah, I think they're Irish.
I don't know, Colin's obsessed.

20:18.926 --> 20:21.095
‐Mmm, boy's got good taste.
‐

20:24.849 --> 20:28.978
Hey, I got an idea, but,
uh, you may hate it.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.439
Your mom had a really beautiful
wedding dress.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.777
And I don't know where it is
now, but your grandmother,

20:36.861 --> 20:37.361
she'd probably have it.

20:37.445 --> 20:39.405
We know she's a hoarder.

20:41.282 --> 20:43.284
Okay. It was
a terrible idea.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.953
No.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.496
I love it.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.210
‐How'd it go?
‐Hey, Margaret, do you know

20:53.294 --> 20:55.838
where Helen's wedding dress is?

20:55.921 --> 20:58.215
She looked like a vagabond whore
in that dress. Why?

20:58.299 --> 21:01.010
Okay,
let's just check the attic.

21:30.915 --> 21:32.416
Sorry, I need a minute.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.591
What's wrong?

21:43.969 --> 21:46.639
You hate it?

21:46.722 --> 21:49.058
- ‐You hate it, right?
- ‐ No.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.810
Don't worry, don't worry.
We'll get another one.

21:50.893 --> 21:51.852
It's not the dress.
I love the dress.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.729
What is it?

21:53.813 --> 21:54.480
This wedding is gonna be

21:54.563 --> 21:56.357
‐a fucking disaster.
‐What?

21:56.440 --> 21:58.400
No, it's not. Come on,
we're pulling it together.

21:58.484 --> 21:58.984
We got a tent,
we got the plates,

21:59.068 --> 21:59.902
now we got a dress.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.946
That's not what I mean.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.405
Then what is it?

22:11.205 --> 22:13.541
I cheated on Colin.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.213
Okay.

22:19.296 --> 22:21.048
Okay? That's what
you have to say to me?

22:21.131 --> 22:24.218
‐No, no.
‐God, why am I not surprised?

22:24.301 --> 22:25.101
When did this happen? Recently?

22:25.135 --> 22:28.264
Yeah.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.890
After you got engaged?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.142
Yeah.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.564
And I have to tell him, right?

22:39.567 --> 22:43.696
Uh... uh, not necessarily.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.992
I mean... did you want
to be with this other guy?

22:48.075 --> 22:49.702
No. God, no.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.454
Well, is there any other way
that Colin might find out?

22:52.538 --> 22:56.083
I mean, is it someone
who's around a lot, do you have

22:56.166 --> 22:59.378
‐friends in common?
‐No. Why?

23:01.046 --> 23:03.424
Because, in that case,
telling Colin might just

23:03.507 --> 23:05.092
hurt him unnecessarily.

23:05.175 --> 23:08.012
And end your relationship.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.346
I mean, unless...

23:09.430 --> 23:11.098
‐What?
‐Well, unless

23:11.181 --> 23:13.225
that's what you were
trying to do.

23:13.309 --> 23:14.518
‐
‐I...

23:17.438 --> 23:21.567
I don't know.
Uh... maybe.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.947
Whitney?

23:27.031 --> 23:29.491
Do you want to marry Colin?

23:29.575 --> 23:31.118
If you're asking if he's
the only person I'll ever love,

23:31.201 --> 23:33.537
I... I have no
fucking idea.

23:33.621 --> 23:35.039
How am I supposed to know that?

23:35.122 --> 23:36.123
Look, I don't think
anybody knows that.

23:36.206 --> 23:38.751
Yes, they do.
Some people do.

23:38.834 --> 23:39.960
‐Colin does.
‐Now, you don't know that.

23:40.044 --> 23:41.170
You're not in his head.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.340
For all you know, he's...
he's having major doubts, too.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.008
‐Wow.
‐No... not about you,

23:46.091 --> 23:48.093
about marriage.

23:48.177 --> 23:50.679
When I got married,
I thought that if you,

23:50.763 --> 23:51.847
if you, if you chose
the right person,

23:51.931 --> 23:54.308
then you'd be happy forever,
and if you were unhappy,

23:54.391 --> 23:55.601
then they were the wrong person.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.603
But that's just not
how it works.

23:57.686 --> 23:59.146
‐It's not?
‐No. No.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.481
Marriage is...
it's not magic, it's,

24:00.564 --> 24:02.983
it's just a decision
that you have to make.

24:03.067 --> 24:06.445
And keep on making,
over and over, to stay.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.405
Whitney,

24:08.489 --> 24:09.698
deciding you're not ready

24:09.782 --> 24:11.116
doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.493
It means you know yourself

24:12.576 --> 24:14.662
much better than I knew
when I was your age.

24:15.621 --> 24:18.666
No, I'm not hurting Colin.
I'm not doing it.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.542
‐He's my best friend.
‐He'll be okay.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.169
He, he... he'll survive.

24:22.252 --> 24:25.089
You hurt Mom so badly.

24:27.633 --> 24:29.468
Yeah, but that was...

24:29.551 --> 24:32.680
that was different.
We had four kids.

24:32.763 --> 24:34.932
I don't want to ever hurt anyone
the way you hurt her.

24:35.015 --> 24:37.518
Right.

24:37.601 --> 24:39.186
Why did you do it?

24:39.269 --> 24:41.605
If marriage is a choice,
if you can decide to stay,

24:41.689 --> 24:43.190
why did you go?

24:47.277 --> 24:49.488
I don't know how to answer that.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.157
Was it Alison?

24:52.241 --> 24:54.368
Did you just love her
more than you loved us?

24:54.451 --> 24:55.536
No.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.079
What was it, then?

25:01.333 --> 25:02.710
I don't know.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.086
See, the thing
that I don't get is,

25:04.169 --> 25:05.921
you were a good dad.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.258
And Mom was a great mom,
and‐and we were happy.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.051
Or at least I thought we were.

25:11.135 --> 25:12.678
And then...

25:15.556 --> 25:17.683
I guess I just worry that,

25:17.766 --> 25:19.393
if that wasn't real

25:19.476 --> 25:20.853
and if that wasn't good,

25:20.936 --> 25:25.274
then... then maybe nothing is.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.985
Whitney, look, I fucked up.

25:28.068 --> 25:28.868
I...

25:33.073 --> 25:35.451
I was thinking about myself,
and I fucked up.

25:38.746 --> 25:43.042
Which is why I want you
to give yourself the time

25:43.125 --> 25:44.585
to make the right decision.

25:47.337 --> 25:50.632
I love you, Whit.
I just want you to be happy.

25:51.842 --> 25:54.720
I love you, too.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.722
Come on.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.689
I got to change
out of this dress.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.411
Oh, fuck.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.010
Hello?

26:35.094 --> 26:38.597
<i>Noah, hi. This is</i>
<i>Petra Ranes from</i> Vanity Fair.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.142
Oh, hi, Petra.
It's been a while.

26:42.226 --> 26:43.685
‐How are you?
<i>‐I'm good.</i>

26:43.769 --> 26:46.063
<i>And the piece is really
coming together.</i>

26:46.146 --> 26:47.272
‐Great.
<i>‐I'm just doing a last</i>

26:47.356 --> 26:49.149
<i>little bit of fact‐checking,
if you have a second.</i>

26:49.233 --> 26:52.152
‐Sure.
<i>‐Great.</i>

26:52.236 --> 26:55.155
<i>So, do you happen to know
a woman named Eden Bishop?</i>

26:56.448 --> 26:58.242
Uh... no, I don't think so.

26:58.325 --> 26:59.660
<i>That's her married name.</i>

26:59.743 --> 27:03.455
<i>Maybe you know her
as Ellery? Eden Ellery?</i>

27:03.539 --> 27:05.332
Oh, yeah, yeah, she was,
uh, she was my publicist

27:05.415 --> 27:07.751
on the book tour for <i>Descent.</i>

27:07.835 --> 27:09.461
<i>That's what she said, too.</i>

27:10.462 --> 27:12.297
Okay?

27:12.381 --> 27:13.841
<i>Did you two have a relationship?</i>

27:13.924 --> 27:16.051
<i>Beyond the professional?</i>

27:16.135 --> 27:17.886
Me and Eden?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.639
<i>She claims you pressured her
into sleeping with you</i>

27:20.722 --> 27:22.140
<i>on the book tour.</i>

27:22.224 --> 27:24.017
<i>Does that match
your recollection?</i>

27:29.297 --> 27:30.097
Sorry, wh‐what did you say?

27:30.107 --> 27:32.693
The reception here is terrible.

27:32.776 --> 27:33.576
<i>Eden claims you coerced her
into having sex</i>

27:33.652 --> 27:36.405
<i>while on the book tour together.</i>

27:36.488 --> 27:38.949
<i>I'm asking if you remember
something like that happening</i>

27:39.032 --> 27:40.951
<i>between you and her
during that time.</i>

27:42.494 --> 27:44.830
No. Absolutely not.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.039
<i>Are you sure?</i>

27:46.123 --> 27:49.001
This is fucking shit!
What? No!

27:49.084 --> 27:50.210
<i>So that's not your memory?</i>

27:50.294 --> 27:53.046
‐No!
<i>‐Okay. That's it, then.</i>

27:53.130 --> 27:55.799
<i>I just needed a comment.
Thanks for your time.</i>

28:00.137 --> 28:02.306
What...?

28:04.349 --> 28:06.435
Oh, fuck.

29:36.650 --> 29:38.485
Yes?

29:38.568 --> 29:42.781
Hi, I'm looking
for Benjamin Cruz.

29:48.245 --> 29:50.414
I'm Ben Cruz.

29:50.497 --> 29:51.873
Can I help you?

29:52.916 --> 29:57.212
I just wanted to ask
about your clinic.

29:57.295 --> 30:02.134
I... I need help.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.302
I think I have PTSD.

30:05.262 --> 30:08.015
Ah.

30:08.098 --> 30:09.766
What's your name?

30:09.850 --> 30:12.144
Gabrielle.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.523
Very nice to meet you.

30:16.606 --> 30:19.526
Come on inside.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.952
Danny, Isla, meet Gabrielle.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.038
She's here to learn
about our community.

30:31.121 --> 30:31.955
‐Hey there.
‐Hey.

30:34.332 --> 30:35.417
Hi.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.003
I thought I was the only one

30:38.086 --> 30:40.839
who read real books anymore.

30:45.052 --> 30:47.012
How about I give you a tour?

30:51.808 --> 30:54.644
I believe in the healing power

30:54.728 --> 30:57.856
of fresh air
and tilling the land.

30:57.939 --> 31:01.193
Everything here has been
designed to be self‐sustaining.

31:01.276 --> 31:04.529
My patients get free lodging

31:04.613 --> 31:08.366
in return for their time
in the garden.

31:08.450 --> 31:11.119
So, a‐are you
a veteran, Gabrielle?

31:11.203 --> 31:14.247
Um, no, I'm not.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.666
How did you find us, then?

31:16.750 --> 31:19.002
Recommendation.

31:21.671 --> 31:25.425
I only ask because we
mostly service ex‐military.

31:25.509 --> 31:26.802
When I was a young vet,
I started

31:26.885 --> 31:30.472
my post‐service career
at the VA,

31:30.555 --> 31:32.516
during what I thought
was a really exciting time

31:32.599 --> 31:34.434
for PTSD therapy.

31:34.518 --> 31:37.562
Newer, integrative
psychotherapeutic approaches

31:37.646 --> 31:40.649
like exposure therapy, EMDR.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.068
They all seemed
to be taking root

31:43.151 --> 31:45.570
in the mainstream community,

31:45.654 --> 31:49.032
but then, of course,
they were obliterated

31:49.116 --> 31:51.785
as soon as the government
deregulated

31:51.868 --> 31:53.495
psychopharmaceutical drugs.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.455
If vets want
alternative therapies,

31:55.539 --> 31:58.041
they have to seek them
under the table,

31:58.125 --> 32:01.002
pay out of pocket,
get treatments in secret.

32:01.086 --> 32:05.006
If the VA finds out,
people lose their health care.

32:06.758 --> 32:08.468
Anyway,

32:08.552 --> 32:12.430
that's why I have to be
extra careful

32:12.514 --> 32:14.307
when people knock on my door.

32:14.391 --> 32:18.061
Well, you weren't that careful.
You kind of just let me in.

32:19.271 --> 32:22.107
True.

32:23.233 --> 32:26.027
But you have an honest face.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.781
We grow all our own food.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.074
There's something so

32:31.158 --> 32:33.869
satisfying about putting
your hands in the dirt,

32:33.952 --> 32:37.914
turning the soil,
caring for the space,

32:37.998 --> 32:42.043
and then watch it
as it bears fruit.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.421
Here,

32:44.504 --> 32:47.549
the land that we've
taken care of

32:47.632 --> 32:49.968
then turns around
and cares for us.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.054
I firmly believe,

32:53.138 --> 32:56.516
if we can remember
how to care for a garden,

32:56.600 --> 33:00.395
we can remember
how to care for each other.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.907
Thank you.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.869
Let's head back inside.

33:15.952 --> 33:19.331
Get to know each other
a bit better.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.879
So...

33:25.962 --> 33:28.048
Gabrielle.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.175
That's a beautiful name,
by the way.

33:30.258 --> 33:30.717
Thank you.

33:30.800 --> 33:34.638
Is it a family name?

33:34.721 --> 33:36.556
Yes.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.560
So tell me,

33:40.644 --> 33:42.771
how can I help you?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.735
I think I suffer from PTSD.

33:48.818 --> 33:53.782
Okay.
How does that manifest?

33:55.617 --> 33:58.078
I can't connect with people.
I think I'm incapable of love.

33:58.161 --> 34:02.749
Well, sometimes such feelings
are connected

34:02.832 --> 34:07.087
to a significant loss or trauma

34:07.170 --> 34:08.255
at an early age.

34:10.507 --> 34:13.092
Does that resonate with you?

34:13.176 --> 34:14.469
No.

34:14.552 --> 34:18.014
Hmm.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.934
Are you familiar with EMDR?

34:21.016 --> 34:22.978
No.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.063
It's an old form of therapy.

34:25.146 --> 34:28.942
Nobody really understands
why it works or how,

34:29.025 --> 34:31.277
but it does.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.487
There's something
almost magical about it.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.284
Mm. You don't believe in magic?

34:37.367 --> 34:38.034
No.

34:38.118 --> 34:43.206
Maybe that's why
you have such...

34:43.290 --> 34:45.166
trouble with love.

34:47.668 --> 34:50.130
Would you like to try EMDR?

34:50.213 --> 34:54.009
J‐Just to see if we can get
a little closer

34:54.092 --> 34:58.305
to understanding why you came.

35:00.724 --> 35:04.561
Sure. Why not?

35:04.644 --> 35:06.688
Excellent.

35:06.771 --> 35:09.524
I record all my sessions.
Do you mind?

35:11.651 --> 35:13.862
And this is just

35:13.945 --> 35:17.616
our standard release form.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.453
It's on paper.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.788
I know. What can I say?

35:23.872 --> 35:25.749
I am nostalgic
for the analog world.

35:25.832 --> 35:29.252
I suspect you are, too.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.964
Well, take a moment,
read it through.

35:33.048 --> 35:35.091
What's the date?

35:35.175 --> 35:36.718
Oh, don't worry about that.

35:36.801 --> 35:37.601
I just need your signature.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.684
Okay. Thank you.

35:44.768 --> 35:46.144
So...

35:46.227 --> 35:49.230
the way EMDR works.

35:50.523 --> 35:54.694
We pick one specific
traumatic event

35:54.778 --> 35:56.321
and then we basically
rewrite the script

35:56.404 --> 36:00.700
so it doesn't trigger
the same debilitating response.

36:00.784 --> 36:01.993
Does that make sense?
Good.

36:02.077 --> 36:07.540
We can start
on any memory, really.

36:07.624 --> 36:10.877
Is there a moment, a...

36:10.960 --> 36:14.047
a night where you remember this,

36:14.130 --> 36:17.008
as you say, "inability to love"

36:17.092 --> 36:19.010
really manifesting itself,

36:19.094 --> 36:21.429
impeding your life in some way?

36:24.974 --> 36:26.726
I...

36:28.478 --> 36:32.232
I had a fight
with my boyfriend recently.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.609
Excellent.

36:34.693 --> 36:38.738
That is the perfect thing
to unpack with this therapy.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.156
Let's start there.

36:40.240 --> 36:44.577
Can you please, um,
move your chair

36:44.661 --> 36:45.870
to face me.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.501
Good.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.882
No, see, you need to be
a little closer.

36:57.966 --> 37:01.761
There you go.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.471
Okay, to begin,

37:03.555 --> 37:07.058
just follow my fingers
with your eyes.

37:11.104 --> 37:13.565
‐Th‐That makes me dizzy.
‐Okay.

37:13.648 --> 37:17.402
Let's switch to something else.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.448
Your palms up.

37:21.531 --> 37:23.366
There you go.

37:26.453 --> 37:30.957
Close your eyes
and take a deep breath.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.964
Now think back
to the night of the fight.

37:38.047 --> 37:41.551
What do you notice?

37:41.634 --> 37:42.434
Where are you?

37:45.138 --> 37:46.973
I'm in my apartment.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.434
‐Where is that?
‐Montauk.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.521
How about your boyfriend,
is he there?

37:53.605 --> 37:54.856
He's on his way.

37:54.939 --> 37:58.067
How do you feel?

37:58.151 --> 38:00.320
Scared.

38:00.403 --> 38:02.906
Good. Go with that.

38:04.908 --> 38:07.911
Same as before.

38:07.994 --> 38:12.457
Tell me...
what do you notice?

38:12.540 --> 38:16.836
My apartment is warm, cozy.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.339
There's a fire in the fireplace.

38:19.422 --> 38:22.217
My daughter's drawings

38:22.300 --> 38:25.220
are on the refrigerator.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.430
It's raining outside.

38:27.514 --> 38:32.894
Pouring, actually.
There's a storm, a... a bad one.

38:32.977 --> 38:33.853
The windows are rattling.

38:33.937 --> 38:36.022
Good. Go with that.

38:36.105 --> 38:40.193
Now what do you see happening?

38:40.276 --> 38:42.529
My boyfriend arrives.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.532
He's soaking wet.
He dries himself by the fire.

38:45.615 --> 38:47.200
How's he dressed?

38:47.283 --> 38:50.119
Jeans and a military jacket.

38:50.203 --> 38:52.997
He's a veteran.

38:53.081 --> 38:53.748
Good.

38:53.832 --> 38:56.960
Close your eyes.

38:57.043 --> 39:00.922
Notice what he says

39:01.005 --> 39:02.382
and go with that.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.677
‐He's angry.
‐Why is he angry?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.179
Because he's married,

39:08.263 --> 39:12.100
and I want him
to leave his wife.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.935
We have a fight.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.771
I tell him that if he doesn't
leave her, I will kill myself.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.398
Keep going.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.817
He tells me that
I'm ugly and stupid

39:20.900 --> 39:22.068
and that nobody
will ever love me,

39:22.151 --> 39:25.530
and that the best I could hope
for is to be someone's slut.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.740
Okay. That's enough.

39:29.659 --> 39:32.537
EMDR doesn't work
if you're lying.

39:44.215 --> 39:47.218
I never said those things.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.596
I respected your mother greatly.

39:52.098 --> 39:55.101
I would never have
spoken that way to her.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.074
Hello, Joanie.

40:10.158 --> 40:11.618
Hello, Ben.

40:14.203 --> 40:16.581
I'm so glad
you are finally here.

40:21.210 --> 40:24.088
Why don't we start again
with the same question?

40:24.172 --> 40:26.758
How can I help you?

40:31.220 --> 40:33.765
Did you kill my mother?

40:37.810 --> 40:40.480
Yes.

40:40.563 --> 40:42.190
I did.

40:50.239 --> 40:54.160
I can only imagine
what you think of me right now.

40:54.243 --> 40:55.870
It's all so new for you.

40:58.623 --> 41:01.834
The truth is, I've been
thinking about you for years.

41:01.918 --> 41:06.214
I've tried to imagine where
you've been living your life

41:06.297 --> 41:07.799
and‐and how.

41:07.882 --> 41:12.220
I've awaited our reunion
with great anticipation.

41:16.307 --> 41:20.603
Is there anything else
you want to ask me?

41:20.687 --> 41:23.356
Anything at all?

41:23.439 --> 41:26.859
Go back behind your desk.
I need a barrier between us.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.779
Of course.

41:37.328 --> 41:40.164
I‐I want to be held
accountable, Joanie.

41:40.248 --> 41:41.833
I've always known
I would eventually

41:41.916 --> 41:44.711
have to answer for what I did.

41:44.794 --> 41:48.423
I welcome the opportunity.

41:51.676 --> 41:55.805
I know this might be hard
for you to believe,

41:55.888 --> 42:00.893
but I think of your mother
every day.

42:00.977 --> 42:03.396
Every minute, in fact.

42:03.479 --> 42:07.859
She is constantly with me,

42:07.942 --> 42:10.403
and...

42:10.486 --> 42:13.656
I hate myself for what I did.

42:13.740 --> 42:15.908
Okay. So why did you do it?

42:18.036 --> 42:20.079
I had a psychotic break.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.247
What?

42:21.330 --> 42:24.250
When I met your mother...

42:24.333 --> 42:26.753
the doctors at the VA
had me on a lot of drugs.

42:26.836 --> 42:28.921
Antidepressants, MDMA,

42:29.005 --> 42:31.257
antipsychotics.

42:31.340 --> 42:33.885
I was losing my mind.

42:33.968 --> 42:37.930
I couldn't sleep.
Uh, I‐I‐I was paranoid.

42:38.014 --> 42:39.640
I started hearing voices.

42:39.724 --> 42:42.477
I didn't tell anyone,
of course, because...

42:42.560 --> 42:45.521
I, I was afraid
they'd lock me up for good.

42:45.605 --> 42:50.610
That night...
I became a monster,

42:50.693 --> 42:53.154
uh, completely out of control.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.616
What did you do to her?

42:56.699 --> 42:58.951
Well, we had an argument

42:59.035 --> 43:01.996
in her apartment,
as you guessed.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.372
About what?

43:03.456 --> 43:05.124
The fact that I was married.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.835
So I was right.

43:07.919 --> 43:10.338
Yes.

43:10.421 --> 43:14.425
But she told me to leave.

43:16.969 --> 43:20.807
It was me
who was begging to stay.

43:20.890 --> 43:22.016
Why?

43:24.102 --> 43:26.354
Have you ever met someone

43:26.437 --> 43:29.649
who‐who looked at you,

43:29.732 --> 43:30.775
all of you,

43:30.858 --> 43:33.152
even the savage parts,

43:33.236 --> 43:34.821
and they didn't flinch?

43:37.073 --> 43:38.825
No.

43:38.908 --> 43:39.867
I thought she was gonna
be the one to bring me back,

43:39.951 --> 43:44.455
restore me to the man I was
before I went to war.

43:44.539 --> 43:45.957
That night

43:46.040 --> 43:48.793
we tried to make love...

43:51.045 --> 43:53.172
...and...

43:53.256 --> 43:55.299
I found that I couldn't.

43:55.383 --> 43:58.469
For years after Afghanistan,

43:58.553 --> 44:02.181
I had thought
the problem was my wife.

44:02.265 --> 44:04.392
But then, all of a sudden,
it was clear.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.104
The problem had been me
all along.

44:10.398 --> 44:13.943
My fate was sealed.

44:14.026 --> 44:17.947
I would never be the man
I was before the war.

44:18.030 --> 44:20.283
And I was never going
to be enough for Alison

44:20.366 --> 44:22.618
or any woman.

44:22.702 --> 44:24.412
So you killed her?

44:26.956 --> 44:30.126
I never felt such rage.

44:30.209 --> 44:31.752
And because Alison
was in front of me,

44:31.836 --> 44:34.255
I‐I directed it at her.

44:34.881 --> 44:38.217
She said she was leaving.

44:38.301 --> 44:40.720
She ran to the door.

44:40.803 --> 44:44.223
And I didn't want her to go,
so I grabbed her by the arm

44:44.307 --> 44:48.227
to try to bring her back,

44:48.311 --> 44:53.065
and I lost my grip,
and she fell, hard,

44:53.149 --> 44:55.818
against the bookshelf.

44:57.570 --> 45:01.199
Before I could reach her,
this statue, a heavy statue,

45:01.282 --> 45:03.868
it fell on her head.

45:05.745 --> 45:08.706
And she was gone.

45:10.416 --> 45:13.711
So... it was an accident?

45:13.794 --> 45:16.547
Yes, of course.

45:16.631 --> 45:19.759
I never wanted
to hurt your mother.

45:32.855 --> 45:36.609
I have... I have tried...

45:36.692 --> 45:40.029
to find a way to make
what I did bearable.

45:40.112 --> 45:44.408
I have dedicated
the last 30 years of my life

45:44.492 --> 45:48.871
creating this place:
a safe haven for veterans.

45:51.624 --> 45:55.336
So nobody again
will ever lose control

45:55.419 --> 45:58.506
the way I did.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.884
Hurt someone the way
I hurt your mother.

46:01.968 --> 46:04.303
You didn't just hurt her.

46:04.387 --> 46:08.057
You killed her.

46:08.140 --> 46:10.851
Yes, and I'm sorry, Joanie.

46:12.728 --> 46:15.648
If you're so sorry, then why
didn't you turn yourself in?

46:15.731 --> 46:18.901
I‐I don't know what good
it would have done.

46:23.197 --> 46:27.451
I‐I‐I could help more people...

46:27.535 --> 46:31.289
make more amends by being
of service to these men,

46:31.372 --> 46:34.333
rather than waste
the rest of my life

46:34.417 --> 46:37.086
rotting away in some cell.

46:37.169 --> 46:39.839
Don't you think you should have
let a jury make that call?

46:40.923 --> 46:44.218
Y‐You know who I think
should make that call?

46:46.137 --> 46:47.054
You.

46:47.138 --> 46:50.808
Me?

46:51.934 --> 46:55.813
I promised myself
a long time ago, Joanie,

46:55.896 --> 46:58.566
that when you found me‐‐

46:58.649 --> 47:03.279
and I knew it was a "when,"
not an "if"‐‐

47:03.362 --> 47:04.238
that I would submit

47:04.322 --> 47:08.993
to whatever accountability
you demanded,

47:09.076 --> 47:12.246
and I‐I‐I would not resist.

47:13.289 --> 47:14.874
So...

47:14.957 --> 47:19.253
if you want to call
the police right now,

47:19.337 --> 47:20.137
I'll give you my phone.

47:23.632 --> 47:27.678
If you want to...
you want to kill me...

47:29.597 --> 47:32.183
...I'll give you my gun.

47:32.266 --> 47:33.976
I am completely in your hands.

47:41.650 --> 47:45.404
If I were going to kill you,

47:45.488 --> 47:48.616
I wouldn't use a gun.

47:48.699 --> 47:50.910
It's too quick.

47:50.993 --> 47:52.411
Okay.

47:52.495 --> 47:55.414
How would you do it?

47:55.498 --> 47:57.750
I'd like to cut off your dick

47:57.833 --> 48:02.713
and let you bleed out
like a pig until you die.

48:05.341 --> 48:09.887
Well... that's an option, too.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.101
I have to go.
I need to think.

48:15.184 --> 48:16.852
Okay, but, Joanie,

48:16.936 --> 48:19.271
you know where to find me now.

48:19.355 --> 48:21.440
And I'm not gonna run.

48:23.192 --> 48:27.154
I'll be right here
whenever you decide.

48:27.238 --> 48:28.948
I have to go.

48:38.499 --> 48:40.459
So, what are you gonna do?

48:40.543 --> 48:41.961
I don't know.

48:42.044 --> 48:45.172
How about calling the police?

48:45.256 --> 48:47.133
I guess I should?

48:48.717 --> 48:49.969
This man murdered your mother

48:50.052 --> 48:51.470
and then sat there and gave you

48:51.554 --> 48:53.389
a detailed description
of how he did it.

48:53.472 --> 48:56.684
That's a special kind
of psychopath.

48:56.767 --> 48:58.477
He's a lot of things,
but I‐I don't think

48:58.561 --> 49:01.021
he's a psychopath.

49:03.774 --> 49:05.151
What?

49:05.234 --> 49:09.655
He seemed sorry.

49:09.738 --> 49:13.367
Truly sorry.

49:13.451 --> 49:16.328
He spent his entire life
trying to make amends.

49:16.412 --> 49:18.664
Uh, Joanie, most murderers
are sorry for what they did.

49:18.747 --> 49:20.207
They still have to go to prison.

49:20.291 --> 49:22.001
He said I could kill him
if I liked.

49:22.084 --> 49:24.044
I think that would be a mistake.

49:24.128 --> 49:25.171
I wasn't being serious.

49:25.254 --> 49:26.213
‐Yes, you were.
‐No, I wasn't.

49:26.297 --> 49:27.339
I think you were.

49:27.423 --> 49:30.259
‐EJ.
‐Joanie, listen to me.

49:30.342 --> 49:31.844
This problem is
above your pay grade.

49:31.927 --> 49:33.304
There are people who specialize

49:33.387 --> 49:35.264
in crime and punishment
for a living.

49:35.347 --> 49:36.891
That's why they're called
the authorities.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.017
How about we let them
decide what to do

49:38.100 --> 49:41.395
before we take vengeance
into our own hands.

49:41.479 --> 49:45.191
Ben may be sorry, but he was
clearheaded enough at the time

49:45.274 --> 49:47.026
to use your mother's history
of mental illness against her

49:47.109 --> 49:50.404
and make everyone believe
she drowned herself.

49:55.284 --> 49:57.161
That's right.

49:57.661 --> 50:01.373
She drowned.

50:01.457 --> 50:04.126
They found water in her lungs.

50:35.491 --> 50:36.992
Benjamin Cruz?

50:37.076 --> 50:39.245
Can I help you?

50:39.328 --> 50:41.580
I'm Detective Clark,
this is Detective Woods.

50:41.664 --> 50:42.581
We'd like to ask you
a few questions

50:42.665 --> 50:44.625
pertaining to the death
of Alison Bailey.

50:44.708 --> 50:45.709
May we come in?

50:45.793 --> 50:48.212
I've made my decision.

50:51.173 --> 50:52.591
Where did you find her?

50:54.176 --> 50:56.345
She's one of the patients
from my facility.

50:56.428 --> 51:00.724
She went AWOL last night...
and we've been worried sick.

51:00.808 --> 51:03.310
What?

51:03.394 --> 51:05.145
This is her signature,
committing herself

51:05.229 --> 51:07.147
‐to psychiatric care.
‐What?

51:07.231 --> 51:08.899
And this is my case study
for Joanie Lockhart.

51:08.983 --> 51:11.277
She was admitted
three weeks ago.

51:11.360 --> 51:12.444
That's not true.
None of this is true.

51:12.528 --> 51:14.363
Joanie suffers from severe
depression and PTSD.

51:14.446 --> 51:15.948
Her mother tragically
committed suicide

51:16.031 --> 51:18.158
when she was seven years old.

51:18.242 --> 51:21.412
And lately she's been
experiencing homicidal

51:21.495 --> 51:22.496
fantasies and delusions.

51:22.580 --> 51:23.998
‐This is all horseshit.
‐We have been exploring

51:24.081 --> 51:27.001
some of them in a safe,
therapeutic space,

51:27.084 --> 51:29.795
but, um, yesterday
she had a turn for the worse

51:29.878 --> 51:32.881
and she threatened my life.

51:35.551 --> 51:37.303
<i>I'd like to cut off your dick</i>

51:37.386 --> 51:40.806
<i>and let you bleed out
like a pig until you die.</i>

51:40.889 --> 51:42.141
That is not what I said.

51:42.224 --> 51:44.268
That isn't your voice
on the recording?

51:44.351 --> 51:45.978
Of course it is, but it was
meant as a hypothetical,

51:46.061 --> 51:48.314
like... if I <i>were</i> to kill him.

51:51.442 --> 51:54.028
He knew my mother. He isn't just
a random doctor I came to see.

51:54.111 --> 51:57.531
He was dating her when she died.

51:57.615 --> 51:59.658
He told me that he set up
this whole clinic

51:59.742 --> 52:02.411
because he felt like such a shit
for what he did 30 years ago.

52:02.494 --> 52:03.829
Officers,
I have nothing to hide.

52:03.912 --> 52:06.373
I was cleared of any wrongdoing

52:06.457 --> 52:08.375
in Alison Bailey's death
years ago.

52:08.459 --> 52:10.711
The police ruled it
as a suicide.

52:10.794 --> 52:11.879
Joanie just can't accept it.

52:11.962 --> 52:15.341
She needs someone to blame.

52:15.424 --> 52:20.346
She herself has made
a series of suicide attempts,

52:20.429 --> 52:23.891
as you can see referenced
on pages five and six.

52:25.392 --> 52:28.312
Ms. Lockhart,
what are you doing?

52:28.395 --> 52:30.397
Where is it, Ben?

52:30.481 --> 52:32.650
‐Where's your fucking gun?
‐There's no gun.

52:32.733 --> 52:34.526
He said I could kill him with it
if I wanted to.

52:34.610 --> 52:35.944
I don't have a gun, Joanie.

52:36.028 --> 52:37.780
I run a therapeutic center

52:37.863 --> 52:40.032
for PTSD recovery.

52:40.115 --> 52:42.701
A gun would be
a very dangerous thing

52:42.785 --> 52:45.371
to have on these premises,
wouldn't it?

52:45.454 --> 52:47.164
Ms. Lockhart,
is it true what he's saying?

52:47.247 --> 52:49.875
Are you a patient
at this facility?

52:49.958 --> 52:52.711
- ‐No, of course not.
- ‐ All right, but...

52:52.795 --> 52:54.213
this is your signature
on this form?

52:54.296 --> 52:57.049
I wasn't paying attention
to what I was signing.

52:57.132 --> 53:00.219
So you didn't read
what the form said?

53:00.302 --> 53:02.388
You aren't listening to me.

53:02.471 --> 53:04.390
I'm telling the truth.

53:04.473 --> 53:05.273
I'm not the crazy one.

53:05.349 --> 53:08.268
‐He is.
‐Okay, well, why would you sign

53:08.352 --> 53:09.728
something you didn't read,
ma'am?

53:09.812 --> 53:10.896
Because I was too busy
thinking about

53:10.979 --> 53:11.779
how I was gonna kill him.

53:14.650 --> 53:16.610
Mr. Cruz, do you want us

53:16.694 --> 53:18.404
to remove Ms. Lockhart
from the property?

53:18.487 --> 53:20.447
That won't be necessary.

53:20.531 --> 53:22.199
Are you sure, sir?

53:22.282 --> 53:25.411
More than anything, right now,
she needs my support.

53:25.494 --> 53:28.247
Sorry to have wasted
your time, Officers.

53:28.330 --> 53:29.498
Okay.

53:41.385 --> 53:44.596
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.932
You can't touch me now, Joanie.

53:47.015 --> 53:51.061
Police are watching you now.

53:51.145 --> 53:53.856
You'll go to prison
for the rest of your life.

53:53.939 --> 53:56.316
Your kids will grow up
without a mother.

53:56.400 --> 53:58.402
That's not what you want, is it?

53:58.485 --> 54:00.612
What do you know about my kids?

54:00.696 --> 54:01.864
I meant what I said.

54:01.947 --> 54:06.452
I thought about you over the
years, wondered how you were.

54:06.535 --> 54:08.954
Were you watching me?

54:09.037 --> 54:11.123
I looked you up online.

54:11.206 --> 54:12.124
When did you know it was me?

54:12.207 --> 54:15.961
When you took off
your sunglasses.

54:16.044 --> 54:17.504
Why didn't you say
something then?

54:17.588 --> 54:20.132
What was the point
of this whole exercise?

54:23.719 --> 54:25.763
My mother was still breathing

54:25.846 --> 54:28.182
when her body
went into the water.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.434
She didn't die in our apartment
like you said she did.

54:30.517 --> 54:32.644
She had water in her lungs.

54:32.728 --> 54:34.480
She fucking drowned.

54:34.563 --> 54:35.272
Calm down.

54:35.355 --> 54:38.358
Can I get you something?
A drink?

54:38.442 --> 54:40.152
You wanted me
to call the police.

54:40.235 --> 54:41.487
So you could show them
my signature

54:41.570 --> 54:45.782
and play them the tape
and make me seem like a nutjob.

54:45.866 --> 54:49.161
The one person left alive
who knows what you did.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.496
You killed her, and then you
dumped her body in the water.

54:50.579 --> 54:53.749
You made it look like a suicide.
You used her history

54:53.832 --> 54:57.127
and you set her up just like you
set me up, didn't you?

54:59.004 --> 55:00.088
Yes.

55:00.172 --> 55:02.299
Why?

55:02.382 --> 55:03.717
I didn't want to go to prison.

55:03.800 --> 55:06.011
Oh, you're a killer.
You belong in prison.

55:06.094 --> 55:08.722
Oh, thou shall not kill.

55:08.805 --> 55:12.309
Well... except sometimes.

55:12.392 --> 55:14.186
I killed people in Afghanistan,
plenty of them.

55:14.269 --> 55:17.814
Some of them innocent civilians.

55:19.149 --> 55:21.193
It wasn't a crime there.

55:21.276 --> 55:23.529
Why should it be a crime here?

55:24.738 --> 55:28.158
You took my mother from me.

55:30.035 --> 55:31.495
I was a child.

55:34.456 --> 55:35.541
You took her.

55:41.571 --> 55:42.371
You know,

55:42.381 --> 55:45.884
you are just so much like her.

55:45.968 --> 55:47.886
When you showed up at my door,

55:47.970 --> 55:52.099
you seemed so...
strong, so tough.

55:53.267 --> 55:56.270
I should have known
it was a mask.

55:56.353 --> 55:58.063
Just like hers.

55:58.146 --> 55:59.189
You're just as sad

55:59.273 --> 56:01.817
and as frightened as she was.

56:21.003 --> 56:22.963
Harder.

56:23.046 --> 56:24.673
Harder.

56:24.756 --> 56:27.593
Oh.

56:29.428 --> 56:34.266
I understand
why you came here now.

56:34.349 --> 56:37.394
It wasn't for Alison at all.

56:38.895 --> 56:42.774
You just want someone
to put you out of your pain.

56:46.820 --> 56:50.490
I'm not gonna do you that favor.

56:56.288 --> 56:59.791
I'm sorry for your pain, Joanie.

56:59.875 --> 57:02.753
I really am.

57:04.671 --> 57:07.966
But if I go away,

57:08.050 --> 57:10.802
what happens to these patients?

57:10.886 --> 57:12.763
They need me here.

57:12.846 --> 57:16.642
You are so full of shit,
and you know it.

57:16.725 --> 57:18.602
I've paid for my sins.

57:20.270 --> 57:23.982
I can live with myself.

57:28.695 --> 57:31.865
You're the one, apparently,

57:31.948 --> 57:34.076
who cannot.
