00:00.066 --> 00:02.100
There was a domestic violence incident.

00:03.133 --> 00:05.133
You mean, with the father of her child?

00:05.200 --> 00:10.333
Correct. And that's when the baby
was put into my custody.

00:10.400 --> 00:12.000
Stop shaking your head!

00:12.066 --> 00:14.233
You don't take care of the baby.

00:14.300 --> 00:15.934
I buy her clothes, I buy her--

00:16.000 --> 00:17.500
I don't care!

All rise! Court, come to order!

00:48.333 --> 00:49.333
Be seated, everyone.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.400
-Good morning, Judge.
-Morning.

00:52.467 --> 00:55.000
We have case number 1026,
Sherman versus Riggs.

00:55.066 --> 00:59.700
Thank you. Miss Sherman,
you have custody of your granddaughter.

00:59.767 --> 01:01.066
That is correct.

01:01.133 --> 01:02.400
How old is she now?

01:02.467 --> 01:03.467
She's eight months.

01:03.533 --> 01:05.133
How long has she been with you?

01:05.200 --> 01:07.633
She's been with me
since the day she was born.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.033
Where is her mother?

01:09.100 --> 01:10.266
Right there.

01:10.333 --> 01:14.400
That would be you. Was she
living with you when the baby was born?

01:14.867 --> 01:17.166
She did. When she was
released from the hospital,

01:17.233 --> 01:20.500
she came to stay with me
for about a month.

01:20.567 --> 01:24.934
Then she tried to go stay on her own
in her apartment.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.233
Some domestic violence broke out.

01:27.300 --> 01:29.600
You mean, with the father of her child?

01:29.667 --> 01:30.633
Correct.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.567
And that would be the father of the child?

01:32.633 --> 01:34.600
-Yes.
-How old is your daughter?

01:34.667 --> 01:35.934
Twenty-five.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.967
-Is this her first child?
-It is.

01:38.033 --> 01:39.000
How's the baby?

01:39.066 --> 01:40.033
She's amazing.

01:40.100 --> 01:44.400
When the baby was born,
did the state put a social hold

01:44.467 --> 01:46.200
on her being released to her mother?

01:46.266 --> 01:51.133
Not initially. In December, when
there was a domestic violence incident,

01:51.200 --> 01:54.967
they did, and that's when the baby
was put into my custody.

01:55.033 --> 01:59.767
Was the baby living with you and
your daughter and the boyfriend?

01:59.834 --> 02:01.133
Or were they living on their own

02:01.200 --> 02:03.800
when this domestic violence
took place in December?

02:03.867 --> 02:08.433
My daughter was living in an apartment,
but she has some limitations.

02:08.500 --> 02:11.166
So, when she had the baby,
I was there to support her.

02:11.233 --> 02:14.100
They came to stay with me,
I supported both of them.

02:14.166 --> 02:16.867
She wanted to try to live independently.

02:16.934 --> 02:22.433
Although I had some reservations, she
hadn't given me any reason to doubt that.

02:22.500 --> 02:24.567
So, I-- I don't want to say allowed,

02:24.633 --> 02:27.700
but I allowed them to go
without hesitation.

02:27.767 --> 02:30.767
But the baby will still come stay with me
about three days a week

02:30.834 --> 02:35.066
and then go back with her mom.
But in that three-week span,

02:35.133 --> 02:37.467
a domestic violence incident broke out.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.633
-Between the two of them.
-Absolutely.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.533
-And the police were called?
-Absolutely, and Children Services.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.233
And that's when the child was removed.

02:44.300 --> 02:46.300
That's when she was officially removed,
correct.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.800
And when she was officially removed,
she was placed with you.

02:48.867 --> 02:50.700
-That is correct.
-[Judy] Okay, now I got it.

02:50.767 --> 02:52.667
And she's been with you ever since?

02:52.734 --> 02:55.166
That is correct.
But I would like to interject that

02:55.233 --> 03:00.900
I filed for custody of my granddaughter
ten days after she was born,

03:00.967 --> 03:04.734
that would be when she was
released from the hospital,

03:04.800 --> 03:09.600
because my daughter does have limitations
and the father has limitations as well.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.900
-[Judy] Was that granted?
-That was granted.

03:11.967 --> 03:14.800
-Is that order still in existence?
-Yes, it is.

03:14.867 --> 03:17.033
-Do you have a copy of that order?
-I do.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.567
I'd like to take a look at it.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.967
Uh-- Try to behave yourself.

03:22.033 --> 03:23.633
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-[Judy] Good.

03:29.600 --> 03:33.700
I'm not seeing, Miss Sherman,
your name in here.

03:33.767 --> 03:35.667
It's actually Doctor Sherman, and it--

03:35.734 --> 03:38.000
[Judy] Dr. Sherman, I'm not
seeing your name here.

03:38.066 --> 03:41.166
I do have the file
I downloaded on my laptop.

03:41.233 --> 03:42.934
-I need to see them.
-Okay.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.367
-Do you have your laptop with you?
-I do.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.700
[inaudible]

03:47.767 --> 03:48.767
Kevin?

03:58.834 --> 04:03.433
Okay. For the record,
Dr. Sherman has custody of this child

04:03.500 --> 04:06.533
pursuant to a court order.
The court order provides that

04:06.600 --> 04:12.533
any child funds support that's received
for this child go directly to her.

04:12.600 --> 04:16.934
That's what the case is about and
what your claim is that Mr. Riggs,

04:17.000 --> 04:22.367
who is the child's father, who was
actually present at this hearing,

04:22.433 --> 04:25.233
according to the document itself,

04:25.300 --> 04:29.600
he received stimulus money for this child,

04:29.667 --> 04:32.600
which should have gone to you.
That's your claim.

04:32.667 --> 04:35.400
I don't know what Mr. Riggs
has to say about that,

04:35.467 --> 04:39.033
but whatever he has to say about that,
he better say it quickly!

04:39.100 --> 04:42.367
So, let's go directly to you,
now I've got the background of the case.

04:42.433 --> 04:45.834
Dr. Sherman takes care of this baby--
Stop shaking your head.

04:45.900 --> 04:50.033
Don't shake your head. You don't!
You don't take care of the baby.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.800
How did you manage to receive
stimulus money for this child?

04:53.867 --> 04:56.433
Your Honor--
-No, just-- I've asked a question.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.033
-I'm answering only your question, ma'am.
-[Judy] Good.

04:59.100 --> 05:02.500
Your Honor, I had someone else
apply for taxes for me.

05:02.567 --> 05:05.233
I told him to look into it for me
and he applied.

05:05.300 --> 05:08.400
Who did you tell to look into it for you?

05:08.467 --> 05:11.333
A friend. I only know him
on a nickname basis.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.333
What's his nick-name basis?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.400
Tony... or something. I'm sorry.

05:15.467 --> 05:19.533
So, you asked a friend of yours
to look into the fact

05:19.600 --> 05:23.266
that the government was
handing out free money.

05:23.333 --> 05:25.767
Did you get a stimulus check?
For yourself?

05:25.834 --> 05:27.433
-It came with the money--
-[Judy] Just a second.

05:27.500 --> 05:28.834
-Yes, ma'am.
-My question is,

05:28.900 --> 05:31.100
-did you get stimulus money for yourself?
-They camer together, yes, ma'am.

05:31.166 --> 05:32.967
-How much?
-Fourteen hundred.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.867
-Fourteen hundred?
-[Larry] Yeah, twice.

05:35.934 --> 05:38.533
One for her and one for me,
they came together.

05:38.600 --> 05:40.333
-Nothing more, nothing less.
-Just a sec.

05:40.400 --> 05:43.934
Did you get $2,800 for yourself?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.767
Did you get two checks for fourteen--

05:45.834 --> 05:48.500
-No, one check. Yes.
-Just one check for $1,400.

05:48.567 --> 05:52.300
No, no, one check for $2,800
and it went straight to my card.

05:52.367 --> 05:55.734
Mr. Riggs, how much money,
in total, in stimulus,

05:55.800 --> 05:57.834
did you receive from
the federal government?

05:57.900 --> 05:59.633
-In total?
-In total--

05:59.700 --> 06:01.934
Both times that they sent out checks.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.133
One time was only me and
the other time was me and her.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.600
-Just a second. One time was--
-The first one was $1,400, by myself.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.367
-Just my name.
-[Judy] Okay.

06:10.433 --> 06:13.834
And that's before the baby was even born.
And I used all that money.

06:13.900 --> 06:17.367
Just a second. Fourteen hundred dollars,
you got for yourself.

06:17.433 --> 06:20.767
-Yes, ma'am.
-Okay. And are you employed?

06:20.834 --> 06:22.834
At the time, I had just lost my job.

06:22.900 --> 06:25.000
So, the answer is no.
Are you working now?

06:25.066 --> 06:28.500
Self-employed. I do dog grooming
and dog walking right now.

06:28.567 --> 06:30.133
I get paid ten dollars an hour.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.300
-So, not employed, you do odd jobs.
-[Larry] Yes, ma'am.

06:32.367 --> 06:34.166
So, you got a second stimulus check.

06:34.233 --> 06:36.567
And when you do these odd jobs,
you're paid in cash.

06:36.633 --> 06:38.066
-Yes, ma'am.
-[Judy] Okay.

06:38.133 --> 06:42.467
So, the second stimulus check,
after you asked your friend Tony--

06:42.533 --> 06:43.600
[Larry] Mm-hmm.

06:43.667 --> 06:47.333
To look into whether or not you were
entitled to money for your daughter,

06:47.400 --> 06:50.200
-who does not live with you, found out--
-But I take care of her.

06:50.266 --> 06:52.000
-Hmm?
-I take care of her.

06:52.066 --> 06:53.600
I buy her clothes, I buy her--

06:53.667 --> 06:55.300
I don't care!

06:55.367 --> 06:56.367
Yes, ma'am.

06:56.433 --> 07:00.233
It's not your money, period!
It's not your money!

07:00.300 --> 07:03.433
[Larry] All her expenses,
I pay for 'cause she's mine.

07:03.500 --> 07:04.734
I take care of her.

07:04.800 --> 07:09.400
How much money do you give to
Dr. Sherman every week to take care--

07:09.467 --> 07:10.867
-No, look at me!
-Yes, ma'am.

07:10.934 --> 07:12.867
-This comes up with a number!
-I have it here.

07:12.934 --> 07:16.667
-I have it right here.
-How much money, every week,

07:16.734 --> 07:19.266
do you give to Dr. Sherman

07:20.000 --> 07:23.333
-to take care of your daughter?
-[Larry] Yes, ma'am.

07:23.400 --> 07:25.300
-How much money? Just, that's a number!
-We--

07:25.367 --> 07:27.000
-We had an agreement--
-[Judy] No, no, no!

07:27.066 --> 07:28.800
I don't want to hear we had an agreement.

07:28.867 --> 07:31.300
I don't want to hear anything else.
I want a number!

07:31.367 --> 07:33.367
-I gave her nothing because her--
-[Judy] Nothing!

07:33.433 --> 07:36.633
That would be,
you give her zero every week.

07:36.700 --> 07:39.333
-How much money do you g--
-[Larry] She put me on child support.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.533
-They told me not to give it to her.
-[Judy] What?!

07:41.600 --> 07:44.133
She put me on child support.
They told me to pay them, not her.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.400
That's the reason why
I haven't give her nothing.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.400
-[Judy] Just a second.
-Yes, ma'am.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.533
'Cause I take care of everything.

07:49.600 --> 07:54.934
I want to know how much money
you give anybody,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.166
-including a gov--
-[Larry] I give it to my daughter.

07:57.233 --> 08:01.967
Just-- Pay attention. How much money
do you give to anyone,

08:02.033 --> 08:06.100
or any institution, including
a governmental institution--

08:06.166 --> 08:11.000
How much do you give to any person--
Don't give to her--

08:11.066 --> 08:14.867
To any government institution
for your daughter?

08:14.934 --> 08:16.567
Nothing. They want me to pay--

08:16.633 --> 08:20.367
Bup-bup! Don't tell me what they want!
I want to hear a figure or a nothing.

08:20.433 --> 08:23.834
-Ninety dollars a month.
-[Judy] Ninety dollars-- Shh!

08:23.900 --> 08:26.834
-Just a second. So you give n--
-[Larry] Plus eighty.

08:26.900 --> 08:28.200
[theme music playing]

08:28.266 --> 08:32.000
So, the two of you were
irresponsible enough to make a child

08:32.066 --> 08:37.233
that you couldn't take care of,
and foist her upon Dr. Sherman.

08:37.300 --> 08:40.033
If Dr. Sherman didn't take her,
if they took her away from you,

08:40.100 --> 08:42.567
they would've put her
in a strange foster home.

[narrator]
<i>And later today...</i>

08:44.233 --> 08:47.433
Mr. Vaswani, did she have
a conversation with you--

08:47.500 --> 08:48.667
No.

08:48.734 --> 08:51.233
Just a second.
You answered my question too fast!

08:51.300 --> 08:53.867
-[laughs] Sorry. Sorry.
-[Judy] Which means, I don't believe you!

08:53.934 --> 08:56.667
Because you didn't even let me
ask the question.

Child support.

09:20.233 --> 09:26.000
And you give them this $90
from what source of funds?

09:26.066 --> 09:29.800
I do odd jobs. I do what I can
to take care of my family.

09:29.867 --> 09:32.200
I wave signs, I walk dogs--

09:32.266 --> 09:34.767
You're not entitled to the stimulus money!

to spend on everything she needed.

09:48.934 --> 09:50.567
-Her diapers, everything.
-I don't care!

09:50.633 --> 09:53.266
I was supposed to go to school
so I can get more money and I didn't

09:53.333 --> 09:55.433
because I'm gonna take care

All the stimulus money I got,
received that $1,400,

10:03.967 --> 10:05.333
went to my daughter.

-And-- There's an order

10:11.300 --> 10:16.667
of the court that says any money
goes to Dr. Sherman.

10:16.734 --> 10:19.533
I am going to prepare an order

10:19.600 --> 10:23.567
that she is going
to send to the IRS,

10:23.633 --> 10:25.934
who's sending out
all these stimulus checks.

10:26.000 --> 10:30.367
I told her I would pay for the schooling
and she, in turn, put me on child support.

10:30.433 --> 10:33.600
She said yes, okay, we could do that.
And when I went to go pay her,

10:33.667 --> 10:36.100
next thing you know, I had
child support calling me,

10:36.166 --> 10:38.467
talking about, don't give her no money,
pay us.

10:38.533 --> 10:41.066
Listen, let me explain something
to you, Mr. Riggs.

10:41.133 --> 10:43.433
You and your girlfriend
are not the victims here.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.433
-Dr. Sherman--
-Every time I--

10:45.500 --> 10:47.900
-I'm paying. I don't even have a job.
-Bup-bup!

10:47.967 --> 10:49.767
-I want you to pay attention--
-She brags about having three jobs.

10:49.834 --> 10:52.033
I want you to pay attention to me!

10:52.100 --> 10:55.000
-You think you're a victim, here.
-[Larry] I'm giving my best,

10:55.066 --> 10:58.266
-and I have nothing to show for it.
-Don't speak. Don't speak!

10:58.333 --> 11:03.467
God gave you one mouth
and two ears for a reason.

11:03.533 --> 11:06.934
The two of you, based upon
what a court found,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
are incapable of taking--

11:09.066 --> 11:12.934
Don't speak! Don't raise your hand!
Do nothing!

11:13.000 --> 11:17.734
A court, and I'm not going behind that,
found that the two of you,

11:17.800 --> 11:20.467
because the police
had to be called to your home

11:20.533 --> 11:24.066
because there was a domestic dispute
and maybe other things as well,

11:24.133 --> 11:29.533
found that the two of you were
not capable of taking care of an infant.

11:29.600 --> 11:34.233
The infant would be unsafe in your care.
You were present during,

11:34.300 --> 11:37.100
according to the document that I read,
you were present--

11:37.166 --> 11:40.400
-Falsified--
-Don't speak! Don't speak.

11:40.467 --> 11:44.100
Now, that would mean, to me,
that the two of you

11:44.166 --> 11:49.834
were not terribly responsible in
creating a child that you couldn't,

11:49.900 --> 11:51.934
physically, take care of.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.166
Dr. Sherman has already
been through the time

11:56.233 --> 11:59.834
when she wanted to take care of babies.

11:59.900 --> 12:03.834
I remember, because I have
good long-term memory,

12:03.900 --> 12:08.066
when I was Dr. Sherman's age.
And I want to tell you,

12:08.133 --> 12:13.867
the last thing I wanted was full-time
responsibility of an eight-month-old.

12:13.934 --> 12:18.400
Nothing-- I was dancing on my own,
I napped when I wanted to,

12:18.467 --> 12:21.867
I went to dinner when I wanted to,
I saw friends when I wanted to.

12:21.934 --> 12:26.166
I wasn't encumbered, at her age,
by an infant.

12:26.233 --> 12:29.900
I like my grandchildren, I went and
saw them, I patted them on the head,

12:29.967 --> 12:33.533
I gave them some gummy bears,
sometimes a dollar or two,

12:33.600 --> 12:36.266
and then I said to their parents,
"They're all yours."

12:36.333 --> 12:38.934
Just a second-- They're all yours.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.633
So, the two of you were
irresponsible enough to make a child

12:42.700 --> 12:44.433
that you couldn't take care of--

12:44.500 --> 12:46.600
The state says you
couldn't take care of her--

12:46.667 --> 12:51.300
and foist her upon Dr. Sherman.
Now, she could've just as easily,

12:51.367 --> 12:54.200
if Dr. Sherman didn't take her,
if they took her away from you,

12:54.266 --> 12:56.266
they would've put her in
a strange foster home.

12:56.333 --> 12:59.500
You are not entitled to
that child's stimulus check.

12:59.567 --> 13:04.934
How much money, in total--
This requires a number, Mr. Riggs--

13:05.000 --> 13:07.033
-Fourteen hundred, ma'am.
-Fourteen hundred.

13:07.100 --> 13:08.900
Judgment for the Plaintiff.
Thank you very much.

13:08.967 --> 13:12.200
But wait, Judge Sheindlin.
What I am suing for is the fact that,

13:12.266 --> 13:17.500
because he filed before me,
there were certain monies from the IRS

13:17.567 --> 13:21.266
that I was owed on my taxes
that I am not entitled to.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.800
That I can't help you with. You're
entitled to the stimulus money check.

13:24.867 --> 13:28.033
But he has more-- But there was
more than one stimulus and there's also--

13:28.100 --> 13:30.033
-No.
-He said he only received one.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.500
Can you prove to me that
he received more than one?

13:32.567 --> 13:37.200
I don't know what-- But I was
also entitled to the Child Tax Credit.

13:37.266 --> 13:38.367
I work, he doesn't--

13:38.433 --> 13:42.333
Let me explain something to you. He--
Put your paper down!

13:42.400 --> 13:45.133
It's the proof I only got the fourt--
The twenty-- That's it.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.200
-She can't prove you got any more.
-[Larry] Okay. I have the proof.

13:48.266 --> 13:51.967
I would suggest that you
speak to your accountant

13:52.033 --> 13:55.667
and take care of all of this business
in the future.

13:55.734 --> 14:01.433
Right now, what you're getting from him
is $1,400 that he had no right to keep.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.000
-Do you understand?
-I do.

14:03.066 --> 14:05.266
Great. Judgment for the Plaintiff.
We're done.

14:05.333 --> 14:06.800
[Kevin]
Court adjourned.

14:06.867 --> 14:07.834
[theme music playing]

14:07.900 --> 14:09.967
I think she saw right through him.

14:10.033 --> 14:13.200
Every time she asked me for anything,
I gave her the money, I gave it to her.

14:13.266 --> 14:17.500
Everything he said was a lie. He hasn't
been taking care of this baby at all.

14:18.367 --> 14:21.867
That baby was lucky to have a grandmother
that was responsible enough

14:21.934 --> 14:24.100
to take, to take her in,
in her time of need,

14:24.166 --> 14:25.734
to make sure she wasn't neglected.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.500
That's true. Over 40 years I've seen
that people who were irresponsible

14:29.567 --> 14:32.767
and having children that
they're not able to physically

14:32.834 --> 14:35.233
or financially or emotionally
take care of,

14:35.300 --> 14:37.834
those children usually
wind up in a system

14:37.900 --> 14:41.033
that is not as welcoming
as Dr. Sherman.

14:42.133 --> 14:45.867
She was lucky, you know.
Irresponsible people should not have kids.

14:45.934 --> 14:47.967
-[Sarah] Mm.
-Until they're responsible.

14:49.033 --> 14:53.266
Case number 1019, Scott versus Keller.
Please step forward.

14:53.333 --> 14:56.567
[narrator]
<i>Mary Scott is suing her former employee,</i>

14:56.633 --> 15:00.133
<i>Cherrie Keller, for an unpaid car loan.</i>

15:00.200 --> 15:02.033
Ms. Scott, you have a cleaning business?

15:02.100 --> 15:04.367
Well, we recently sold it, but we did.

15:04.433 --> 15:05.900
Okay, who's the "we"?

15:05.967 --> 15:07.066
My husband and I.

15:07.133 --> 15:08.834
How long did you have the business?

15:08.900 --> 15:10.000
About 20 years.

15:10.066 --> 15:11.467
Name of the business?

15:11.533 --> 15:13.266
It was Maryland Cleaning Services.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.633
Did you have full time employees,
part time employees?

15:16.700 --> 15:18.734
-Both.
-What was the Defendant?

15:18.800 --> 15:21.900
She was a part time
independent contractor.

15:21.967 --> 15:24.467
[chuckles] Ms. Scott,
there is no such thing

15:24.533 --> 15:28.667
as a part time independent contractor.
That's just sort of a tax thing.

15:28.734 --> 15:30.333
-[laughs]
-Okay.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.467
Okay? And if you had a business
for 20 years, you know that.

15:33.533 --> 15:36.533
Which means, you didn't pay
medical insurance for her?

15:36.600 --> 15:37.734
-Correct.
-[Judy] Right?

15:37.800 --> 15:39.533
Did you pay her in check or cash?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.934
-Cash.
-So, you paid her in cash.

15:42.000 --> 15:43.834
Did she work for you five days a week?

15:43.900 --> 15:44.834
It varied.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.834
Was it mostly five days a week?

15:46.900 --> 15:48.567
Yes, I'd say yes.

15:48.633 --> 15:50.533
Was it mostly five days a week?

15:50.600 --> 15:52.166
When I was pregnant, yes.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.133
What does that mean,
when you were pregnant?

15:54.200 --> 15:58.066
After I was pregnant, my hours,
they went to, like, three days a week.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.934
Okay. How long did you work
at five days a week?

16:01.000 --> 16:02.467
Probably about almost a year.

16:02.533 --> 16:04.867
Okay, and how much were you paid daily?

16:04.934 --> 16:06.200
It was per job.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.867
Explain that to me, per job.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.400
It depended on, like, the houses
that we had to clean.

16:10.467 --> 16:14.300
So, they were, like, per hour.
So, like, you would clean, like,

16:14.367 --> 16:17.333
a house for, like, one or two hours
and it was like $90 an hour,

16:17.400 --> 16:19.367
but we didn't get that full $90. So--

16:19.433 --> 16:21.300
-You mean, the people who cleaned?
-[Cherrie] Yes.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.100
Well, that's how they made their money.

16:23.166 --> 16:26.734
They would pay the company, and then
they would pay me part-- a percentage.

16:26.800 --> 16:30.867
So, Maryland Cleaning charged
the homeowner $90 an hour.

16:30.934 --> 16:33.533
-Correct.
-And how many women, or men,

16:33.600 --> 16:36.467
-went to a house? Were there a team?
-One to two.

16:36.533 --> 16:38.233
Was it most of the time
with another person?

16:38.300 --> 16:39.567
-Yes.
-[Judy] Okay.

16:39.633 --> 16:43.367
And how much of the $90 an hour
did your team get?

16:43.433 --> 16:44.533
You or your team?

16:44.600 --> 16:47.500
I was a supervisor,
so I would get 21 percent,

16:47.567 --> 16:49.300
and then the lady I would work with,

16:49.367 --> 16:52.600
she would get, I believe,
it was 14... or 19.

16:52.667 --> 16:56.100
And when you were working for Ms. Scott,

16:56.166 --> 16:59.200
-did you pay taxes for that year?
-Nope.

16:59.266 --> 17:01.967
Did you 1099 your employees?

17:02.033 --> 17:03.367
Yes, we did, Your Honor.

17:03.433 --> 17:05.033
No, they did not.

17:05.100 --> 17:06.033
[theme music playing]

17:06.100 --> 17:11.200
I want you to understand that I don't
think this was some kind of mitzvah

17:11.266 --> 17:16.033
that you were doing for the Defendant.
Mitzvah, parenthesis, good deed.

17:16.100 --> 17:18.700
Because if you wanted to
do a mitzvah for her,

17:18.767 --> 17:21.400
you would've done it
while she was pregnant. Right?

17:21.467 --> 17:22.467
Sure.

17:32.166 --> 17:34.400
[narrator]
<i>Cleaning business owner Mary Scott</i>

17:34.467 --> 17:39.100
<i>says her former employee, Cherrie Keller,</i>
<i>owes payments on a car loan.</i>

17:39.166 --> 17:43.100
Okay, now we're gonna move on
because I just had the lay of the land

17:43.166 --> 17:44.900
and I understand your business.

17:44.967 --> 17:47.667
How far into your employment

17:47.734 --> 17:51.066
did Ms. Scott get you a car?

17:51.133 --> 17:55.600
Okay, I worked for them for about a year
and I was-- I got pregnant

17:55.667 --> 17:58.300
and I left for, like, two months
to have the baby.

17:58.367 --> 18:01.734
Before I was even back
is when they offered to buy me a car.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.867
-So, you had worked there for a year.
-Uh-huh.

18:03.934 --> 18:07.633
And so, evidently, you were excited
and happy with her performance

18:07.700 --> 18:10.233
if you were taking her back
after her maternity leave.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.367
-Yeah.
-That's clear,

18:11.433 --> 18:13.133
you don't even have to
answer that question.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.600
I want you to tell me your version
of how it came about

18:16.667 --> 18:20.200
that you either gave her money,
or purchased a car.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.667
-That's in her name?
-[Mary] Yes.

18:21.734 --> 18:26.266
After she came back from maternity leave,
she was having trouble getting to work.

18:26.333 --> 18:30.300
We also needed, you know, employees
be able to drive to jobs and such.

18:30.367 --> 18:32.467
-Uh, just a second.
-[Mary] Okay.

18:32.533 --> 18:35.834
You went over that very fast.
She didn't have a car

18:35.900 --> 18:38.033
-before she was pregnant.
-Correct.

18:38.100 --> 18:41.567
And she worked for you for a period
of time after she became pregnant?

18:41.633 --> 18:44.133
-Correct.
-And--

18:44.200 --> 18:47.333
-During that time, she didn't have a car.
-Correct.

18:47.400 --> 18:49.667
And you didn't offer to get her a car.

18:49.734 --> 18:54.100
You offered to get her a car after
she came back from maternity leave.

18:54.166 --> 18:57.834
Because you not only needed her
to get to where she had to go,

18:57.900 --> 19:00.834
you needed other employees
to get to where they had to go.

19:00.900 --> 19:03.500
-She asked us to get her a car.
-Just a second. Great.

19:03.567 --> 19:04.900
-[Mary] Excuse me.
-No.

19:04.967 --> 19:07.834
Just a minute.
You have to understand, Ms. Scott,

19:07.900 --> 19:12.467
that, you know, if they wanted somebody
really great-looking and young

19:12.533 --> 19:15.567
with no life experiences,
they wouldn't've hired me.

19:15.633 --> 19:18.567
-They might have. [laughs]
-No. No.

19:18.633 --> 19:22.567
So, I understand your business.
I understand now, how it works,

19:22.633 --> 19:26.800
I understand your accounting practices,
and I understand the common sense of,

19:26.867 --> 19:31.867
I've got a lot of workers that I'm paying
14 percent of $90 to an hour,

19:31.934 --> 19:35.200
and I have to get them to and from
their jobs.

19:35.266 --> 19:39.834
So, it inures to my benefit
for an employee

19:39.900 --> 19:45.033
who I know has a history with us
of a year, and was a good employee,

19:45.100 --> 19:47.600
this could be beneficial to everybody.

19:47.667 --> 19:52.734
So, I want you to understand that I don't
think that this was some kind of mitzvah

19:52.800 --> 19:57.166
that you were doing for the Defendant--
Mitzvah, parenthesis, good deed--

19:58.433 --> 20:03.200
That you were doing for her. Because
if you wanted to do a mitzvah for her,

20:03.266 --> 20:05.867
you would've done it
while she was pregnant. Right?

20:05.934 --> 20:07.433
-Sure.
-[Judy laughs] Of course.

20:07.500 --> 20:11.000
So, explain to me, the car is in her name?

20:11.066 --> 20:12.633
-Correct.
-[Cherrie] It's not.

20:12.700 --> 20:14.867
-In whose name is it?
-It's in my boyfriend's name.

20:14.934 --> 20:17.100
-It's in your boyfriend's name?
-Mm-hmm.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.800
Okay, was it purchased
in your boyfriend's name?

20:19.867 --> 20:24.934
No, they wrote a check directly
to the person who the car was from.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.100
And why did you put it
in your boyfriend's name?

20:27.166 --> 20:29.533
Because I couldn't personally
put it in my name.

20:29.600 --> 20:33.800
Just a second. You know, [chuckles]
we're gonna get into that.

20:33.867 --> 20:36.533
-I know. I know.
-[Judy] You know.

20:36.600 --> 20:41.400
Okay, and you couldn't put this car
in your name because...

20:41.467 --> 20:45.834
Because I've had a previous car, the car
broke down and I never took the tags back,

20:45.900 --> 20:48.867
so I couldn't put another car in my name.
They never asked me that.

20:48.934 --> 20:52.834
So, the only way I could actually get it
was to put it in his name.

20:52.900 --> 20:54.900
Just for giggles, did you tell them

20:54.967 --> 20:57.266
that you were putting it in
your boyfriend's name?

20:57.333 --> 20:59.600
No, they never asked any questions,
they just--

20:59.667 --> 21:02.433
Okay, so they just paid the money
to the seller of the car.

21:02.500 --> 21:05.500
And we had to pay for the tags and
the title and everything.

21:05.567 --> 21:08.433
-Okay, and the car is in boyfriend's name.
-Mm-hmm.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.900
And they were taking money
out of your check.

21:10.967 --> 21:13.567
-Correct.
-Every week or so.

21:13.633 --> 21:15.000
-Correct.
-Was it every week?

21:15.066 --> 21:16.633
-Every week.
-Every week. Fifty bucks,

21:16.700 --> 21:18.533
-according to what I read here.
-Correct.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.967
-And then you quit.
-There's more to that, but yes.

21:22.033 --> 21:26.066
Yeah, you're gonna tell me about
this other person that you had to drive.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.934
-Mm-hmm.
-And that she was a problem.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.100
And she drank a little in the morning--

21:30.166 --> 21:32.066
-It was more than a little.
-Just a sec.

21:32.133 --> 21:34.900
Did you ever have a discussion
with Ms. Scott about that?

21:34.967 --> 21:36.700
I had a discussion with Kamlesh.

21:36.767 --> 21:38.166
My husband.

21:38.233 --> 21:39.600
Is your last name Scott?

21:39.667 --> 21:41.266
-No.
-Vaswani.

21:41.333 --> 21:44.633
Mr. Vaswani, did she have
a conversation with you--

21:44.700 --> 21:46.567
-No.
-[stammers] Just a second.

21:46.633 --> 21:48.667
You answered my question too fast.

21:48.734 --> 21:50.834
-[laughs] Sorry. Sorry.
-Which means, I don't believe you.

21:50.900 --> 21:53.533
Because you didn't even let me
ask the question.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.533
-I thought it was finished.
-How could it be finished?

21:56.600 --> 21:59.200
You must have had conversations with her
over the years

21:59.266 --> 22:01.667
-of her employment, did you not?
-Yes. Yes, I did.

22:01.734 --> 22:04.533
Right, I said did you ever have
a conversation with her,

22:04.600 --> 22:07.333
-and you said no.
-I'm sorry, Your Honor.

22:07.400 --> 22:10.233
You know, this can be easy
or it can be hard,

22:10.300 --> 22:12.200
'cause I have a feeling
that everybody here

22:12.266 --> 22:15.767
didn't do everything
according to all the rules.

22:15.834 --> 22:19.700
Did Miss Keller ever discuss with you
the behavior

22:20.333 --> 22:24.033
of one of your employees
that you asked her to pick up?

22:24.100 --> 22:28.500
Uh, no, she did not.
I was not in the office every day.

22:28.567 --> 22:32.967
We had a manager,
and she would be discussing

22:33.033 --> 22:35.333
whatever she wanted to discuss
with the manager.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.834
-The manager?
-Yes.

22:36.900 --> 22:40.166
There's an on-site manager
managing the business.

22:40.233 --> 22:43.100
Did you ever have a conversation
with him directly?

22:43.166 --> 22:45.166
Yes, I have a text message.

22:45.233 --> 22:47.433
-Oh, may I see it? Oh, better!
-[Cherrie] Yes.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.867
-Better!
-[audience chuckles]

22:58.066 --> 23:00.800
-Okay. So, Miss Keller.
-Yes.

23:00.867 --> 23:04.600
There's one line in this whole text
message that refers to her drinking.

23:04.667 --> 23:07.700
-I've talk--
-Just-- Everything else refers to the fact

23:07.767 --> 23:11.300
that this other person, who I gather
was your supervisor--

23:11.367 --> 23:15.667
No, I was the supervisor
driving the drunk lady.

23:15.734 --> 23:19.867
Got it. There's a line here about this
other woman being drunk and,

23:19.934 --> 23:23.467
you know, and if we got pulled over
it would be terrible,

23:23.533 --> 23:27.200
but it appears, from this text,
my overall reading of this text,

23:27.266 --> 23:31.467
is you got fed up with this woman
who was treating you disrespectfully.

23:31.533 --> 23:36.100
Yes, but I've had two phone conversations
prior to that, in detail,

23:36.166 --> 23:38.934
talking to him about the woman
who was drunk.

23:39.000 --> 23:44.867
Okay, but the tenor of your text messages
that your direct supervisor

23:44.934 --> 23:47.834
was disrespectful to you,
and you had worked very hard,

23:47.900 --> 23:49.867
you worked very hard
during your pregnancy,

23:49.934 --> 23:55.633
and you probably came back way too early.
And you say in this text,

23:55.700 --> 23:59.166
you've been very nice to me,
I'm sorry I have to quit,

23:59.233 --> 24:02.834
but I just can't work for someone
who's been disrespectful to me

24:02.900 --> 24:05.800
and continues to be disrespectful to me.
Got it.

24:05.867 --> 24:09.734
You also acknowledge, here,
that I'm gonna pay you for the car.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.567
I was going to. I said-- I did say, also,

24:12.633 --> 24:15.533
once I found a place to live
and I got the money.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.900
-No, Miss Keller, have you tried
-I have two kids.

24:18.967 --> 24:24.533
telling that to [chuckles] J.P. over
at Chase. "I'm gonna pay you back.

24:24.600 --> 24:28.166
Well, but first I have to
find a place to live,

24:28.233 --> 24:30.700
then I have to see if I have
any extra money.

24:30.767 --> 24:33.800
If I have any extra money,
I will repay my car loan."

24:33.867 --> 24:36.400
I had every intention,
it just didn't work out.

24:36.467 --> 24:38.667
It just didn't work out.
Well, that's very nice,

24:38.734 --> 24:40.867
that could've saved me
a whole lot of time

24:40.934 --> 24:44.867
if you said, "I owe you the money,
I'll pay you over time." Okay.

24:44.934 --> 24:48.567
So, left on the money is $2,538.
Is that correct?

24:48.633 --> 24:49.700
Yes, Your Honor.

24:49.767 --> 24:53.834
$2,538 is exactly what you owe.
You haven't made any payments since?

24:53.900 --> 24:56.700
-No, I haven't had--
-$2,538, judgment for the Plaintiff.

24:56.767 --> 24:59.000
-Thank you very much. We're done here.
-Thank you.

24:59.066 --> 25:00.400
[Kevin]
Court adjourned.

25:00.467 --> 25:01.667
[theme music playing]

25:01.734 --> 25:05.867
I explained to him that she was getting
drunk and I just couldn't do it anymore.

25:05.934 --> 25:07.467
We never heard from her. [chuckles]

25:07.533 --> 25:09.100
Time to go separate ways.

25:10.100 --> 25:12.600
You know what I found interesting
about that case?

25:12.667 --> 25:15.834
The Defendant, who owed the money,

25:15.900 --> 25:18.300
was totally comfortable
about telling the truth.

25:18.367 --> 25:22.533
Telling the truth about the car
being in her boyfriend's name.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.200
Totally comfortable.

25:24.266 --> 25:29.900
And the Plaintiffs, because they were,
sort of, skimming over the rules.

25:29.967 --> 25:32.367
You know, that she was
an independent contractor.

25:32.433 --> 25:34.667
Not really, she was really an employee.

25:34.734 --> 25:38.033
And I think, if I took anything away
from that rather simplistic case

25:38.100 --> 25:40.600
was something that I've always known...

25:41.633 --> 25:45.200
If you tell the truth,
you don't have to have a good memory.
