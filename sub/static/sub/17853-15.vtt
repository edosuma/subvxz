WEBVTT

00:01.100 --> 00:03.620
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:03.620 --> 00:06.689
we are third to zero in on something a

00:06.689 --> 00:09.340
special two-hour season finale we were

00:09.340 --> 00:10.940
on things come up

00:10.940 --> 00:12.940
the tech is going on

00:12.940 --> 00:17.760
ten years of planning yes four years of

00:17.760 --> 00:18.760
digging

00:18.760 --> 00:24.610
we think we found in man-made chamber

00:24.610 --> 00:28.890
deep in the money pit

00:28.890 --> 00:31.460
finally pays off

00:31.460 --> 00:35.870
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:35.870 --> 00:38.469
where people have been looking for an

00:38.469 --> 00:40.699
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:40.699 --> 00:43.530
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.530 --> 00:46.949
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.949 --> 00:48.899
symbols carved into it

00:48.899 --> 00:52.789
even a 17th century Spanish coin

00:52.789 --> 00:55.730
today six men have died trying to solve

00:55.730 --> 00:57.589
the mystery

00:57.589 --> 01:00.389
according to legend

01:00.389 --> 01:04.120
one more will have to die 
before the treasure can be found

01:06.000 --> 01:12.074

01:24.120 --> 01:26.760
for Rick and Marty lagina the stakes

01:27.560 --> 01:28.560
couldn't be higher

01:28.560 --> 01:33.270
so far this year they along with their

01:33.270 --> 01:35.679
partners have spent hundreds of hours

01:35.679 --> 01:39.580
and millions of dollars in an effort to

01:39.580 --> 01:43.009
solve the Oak Island mystery once and

01:43.009 --> 01:46.040
I keep I'm thinking we're gonna run out

01:46.040 --> 01:47.040
of wood

01:47.040 --> 01:49.939
load after load foods are coming up

01:49.939 --> 01:50.939
coming up

01:50.939 --> 01:54.700
yeah for about five six that are all we

01:54.700 --> 01:57.469
dumped already dumped one love so far

01:57.469 --> 01:59.409
they have completed excavating three

01:59.409 --> 02:01.820
massive holes in an effort to find the

02:01.820 --> 02:04.369
mysterious treasure vault although each

02:04.369 --> 02:07.560
location did yield a number of important

02:07.560 --> 02:09.110
clues

02:09.110 --> 02:17.630
no one of this is part of the money pit

02:17.630 --> 02:20.500
the original money pit

02:20.500 --> 02:22.620
the team's enormous frustration over the

02:22.620 --> 02:25.080
failure of their third hole prompted a

02:25.080 --> 02:27.520
rare emotional confrontation between

02:27.520 --> 02:30.860
Rick and his brother Marty there has to

02:30.860 --> 02:34.020
be and enough see enough maybe we're

02:34.020 --> 02:37.400
done with the money pit no I'm

02:37.400 --> 02:39.810
interested going to the southwest and

02:39.810 --> 02:42.530
then we continue pushing a hold on you

02:42.530 --> 02:48.290
want to do this yeah I do I'm kind of

02:48.290 --> 02:52.060
feeling shifted towards doing it but you

02:52.060 --> 02:54.280
know what I think the final position of

02:54.280 --> 02:56.600
this one should be yours nobody deserves

02:56.600 --> 02:59.460
that more than you it is as simple as

02:59.460 --> 03:00.460
that

03:00.460 --> 03:03.600
you do it together

03:03.600 --> 03:09.170
the result was gal 1 which was named

03:09.170 --> 03:12.230
after Rick and Marty's parents for them

03:12.230 --> 03:14.920
it symbolizes not only their bond as

03:14.920 --> 03:18.310
brothers but also their determination to

03:18.310 --> 03:20.690
honor the sacrifices of everyone who has

03:20.690 --> 03:22.780
helped make their childhood dream a

03:22.780 --> 03:25.950
reality

03:25.950 --> 03:28.010
Charles well in the tester well we

03:28.010 --> 03:30.180
decided to name it after our parents so

03:30.180 --> 03:31.811
rather than just the lagina and well we

03:31.811 --> 03:33.420
decided to call it the George and an

03:33.420 --> 03:35.400
lagina and well and I think our sisters

03:35.400 --> 03:39.940
would be happy with it as well yeah

03:39.940 --> 03:42.930
unfortunately gal one is the last hole

03:42.930 --> 03:45.570
that will be dug on Oak Island this year

03:45.570 --> 03:49.150
these are the partners have spent well

03:49.150 --> 03:51.600
beyond their engineering budget and

03:51.600 --> 03:54.450
another harsh Nova Scotia winter is only

03:54.450 --> 03:57.950
a few weeks away actionable information

03:57.950 --> 03:59.530
has to come from that hole is that

03:59.530 --> 04:01.230
simple you have to find something

04:01.230 --> 04:05.230
underground we want answers Rick wants

04:05.230 --> 04:08.290
answers I would like answers so we're

04:08.290 --> 04:10.840
moving forward we're down to the debt

04:10.840 --> 04:13.370
where that we went to the I think of

04:13.370 --> 04:15.460
shaft number six they went to 118 and

04:15.460 --> 04:18.410
then went across and right and they had

04:18.410 --> 04:21.170
the big cave-in so I think that's the

04:21.170 --> 04:24.240
one we're seeing right here

04:24.240 --> 04:27.280
in 1861 a team of treasure hunters dug a

04:27.280 --> 04:30.640
large shaft 18 feet west of the original

04:30.640 --> 04:33.780
money pit known simply as shaft number

04:33.780 --> 04:38.320
six it was excavated to a depth of 118

04:38.320 --> 04:41.040
feet in an effort to come in underneath

04:41.040 --> 04:43.030
what they hoped would be a treasure

04:43.030 --> 04:46.570
vault unfortunately as the tea began

04:46.570 --> 04:48.530
tunneling eastward toward the money pit

04:48.530 --> 04:52.660
they hid a booby-trapped flood tunnels

04:52.660 --> 04:54.560
which inundated the shaft with seawater

04:54.560 --> 04:58.370
but even worse was what happened a few

04:58.370 --> 05:01.190
days later when several loud crashes

05:01.190 --> 05:04.070
were hurt underground indicating that

05:04.070 --> 05:06.840
the wooden Timbers of shaft number six

05:06.840 --> 05:08.900
along with the wooden cribbing inside

05:08.900 --> 05:10.730
the money pit had collapsed and most

05:10.730 --> 05:13.810
likely created a cave-in of the treasure

05:13.810 --> 05:15.950
vault one which would have scattered its

05:15.950 --> 05:20.070
precious contents into other areas deep

05:20.070 --> 05:21.600
below ground

05:21.600 --> 05:23.400
the money pit collapsed towards shop

05:23.400 --> 05:25.240
number six that's the debris field

05:25.240 --> 05:27.430
that's what I'm looking for we need to

05:27.430 --> 05:29.830
take a good hard look at all spoil so as

05:29.830 --> 05:33.410
I come up and metal detect you know go

05:33.410 --> 05:35.510
through it physically because it could

05:35.510 --> 05:36.814
be anywhere with from 85 feet give or

05:36.814 --> 05:37.814
take to 118

05:37.814 --> 05:38.814
I think it's the tunnel searcher tunnel

05:38.814 --> 05:39.814
so we gotta get the bottom of the

05:39.814 --> 05:47.300
tunnels where the treasure blew out

05:47.300 --> 05:53.260
they'd be sitting on the bottom

05:53.260 --> 06:00.230
yeah because they came Donald and then

06:00.230 --> 06:01.230
went over but when we go out of the wood

06:01.230 --> 06:04.150
we shouldn't bring it you should be

06:04.150 --> 06:08.670
bringing something up if the gal one

06:08.670 --> 06:11.080
exploration hole has breached shaft

06:11.080 --> 06:13.840
number six could the team really be just

06:13.840 --> 06:16.030
a few feet away from the original money

06:16.030 --> 06:19.920
pit did you get some depth yes sir our

06:19.920 --> 06:23.670
119 with the casing and 114 with the

06:23.670 --> 06:24.670
hole

06:24.670 --> 06:27.300
I live down the step so Rick

06:27.300 --> 06:29.300
at this point with the wood you see

06:29.300 --> 06:30.980
coming up are you concerned at all about

06:30.980 --> 06:32.860
that is that I was initially because you

06:32.860 --> 06:35.030
know we're getting raw material which is

06:35.030 --> 06:36.030
hand-hewn

06:36.030 --> 06:39.520
comes on the side of a shaft the only

06:39.520 --> 06:43.890
definitive statement you can make is

06:43.890 --> 06:44.960
when you

06:44.960 --> 06:46.550
it's like hunting for a treasure galleon

06:46.550 --> 06:49.000
and the ship wrecked or was lost there's

06:49.000 --> 06:51.440
a scatter of clues across the ocean

06:51.440 --> 06:53.940
floor we could basically have the same

06:53.940 --> 06:54.940
thing going on

06:54.940 --> 06:56.120
where did it go

06:56.120 --> 07:02.870
information is up in the Spoils

07:02.870 --> 07:10.390
they're up there 130 yeah I want to see

07:10.390 --> 07:11.650
one more

07:11.650 --> 07:13.530
always one more

07:13.530 --> 07:16.840
as the steel caisson continues to grind

07:16.840 --> 07:18.810
its weight even lower into the possible

07:18.810 --> 07:21.669
treasure site just a few hundred feet

07:21.669 --> 07:25.380
away on lot 18 Marty lagina along with

07:25.380 --> 07:27.870
Charles Barkhouse and metal detection

07:27.870 --> 07:30.340
expert Gary Drayton are searching

07:30.340 --> 07:32.080
through the spoils that have recently

07:32.080 --> 07:39.900
been removed from Gao on this area all

07:39.900 --> 07:42.610
the peaks

07:42.610 --> 07:46.139
this stuff is incredibly hard to shovel

07:46.139 --> 07:48.140
and so I'm basically just using the

07:48.140 --> 07:50.270
teeth of the backhoe to to shuttle it

07:50.270 --> 07:52.180
back and forth the depth of

07:52.180 --> 07:54.340
investigation of his metal detector is

07:54.340 --> 07:57.170
only about 1218 inches so if you have a

07:57.170 --> 07:58.170
two foot violator you're missing you

07:58.170 --> 08:00.730
know almost a foot of material

08:10.330 --> 08:15.420
that's how tuber should we try digging

08:22.020 --> 08:24.530
in there Miyoung

08:24.530 --> 08:29.900
and the cool fine Charles

08:29.900 --> 08:33.490
was it looks like a sailcloth needle

08:33.490 --> 08:35.309
tonight really that looks like

08:35.309 --> 08:37.698
double-ended that's like it I mean

08:37.698 --> 08:42.099
obviously it's made in that shape that's

08:42.099 --> 08:46.410
cool Marnie Gary thinks he found a

08:46.410 --> 08:50.560
sailcloth needle really yep sailing

08:50.560 --> 08:52.709
cloth needle it would have been made out

08:52.709 --> 08:54.450
of iron and obviously they would have

08:54.450 --> 08:59.589
wrapped the Fred around it use it for

08:59.589 --> 09:03.310
sewing canvas sails put the last the

09:03.310 --> 09:06.680
last one through the dead man - yeah

09:06.680 --> 09:08.360
yeah that's the way it goes they call it

09:08.360 --> 09:10.350
a dead man's stitch or something just to

09:10.350 --> 09:12.970
see if he was alive before they threw

09:12.970 --> 09:16.389
him overboard during the period from the

09:16.389 --> 09:19.430
15th to the 18th century it was

09:19.430 --> 09:21.470
customary for a man who died while

09:21.470 --> 09:23.800
aboard a sailing ship to be buried at

09:23.800 --> 09:24.800
sea

09:24.800 --> 09:27.449
dead men's body would often be sewn into

09:27.449 --> 09:30.079
his hammock with the last ditch made

09:30.079 --> 09:32.589
through his nose or his lips to make

09:32.589 --> 09:33.930
sure he was deceased

09:33.930 --> 09:38.199
good the sailcloth Neal found buried in

09:38.199 --> 09:40.740
the money pit area be further evidence

09:40.740 --> 09:43.360
that a large sailing ship was once used

09:43.360 --> 09:45.540
to bring something of great value to Oak

09:45.540 --> 09:49.029
Island centuries ago the reason why

09:49.029 --> 09:51.170
Geary is here of course is because he's

09:51.170 --> 09:53.610
he's eminently capable with that MindLab

09:53.610 --> 09:58.360
CTX 3030 metal detector let's find some

09:58.360 --> 09:59.360
gold

09:59.360 --> 10:03.110
agreed my whole thing about the alcohol

10:03.110 --> 10:05.279
is that hopefully we're in the debris

10:05.279 --> 10:08.620
field if we are then we need him to find

10:08.620 --> 10:14.179
something if it's there Gary a find the

10:14.179 --> 10:17.189
decent sound and target here yeah

10:17.189 --> 10:23.319
underneath that pile there and if you

10:23.319 --> 10:25.600
could dump it here it would be great

10:25.600 --> 10:27.040
yeah gave me through that stuff

10:27.040 --> 10:34.959
it's something

10:34.959 --> 10:50.820
I found the coin

10:50.820 --> 11:03.470
the gold coin right this I gotta see

11:03.470 --> 11:05.019
we've got coin I found the coin come on

11:05.019 --> 11:09.860
whoa the gold coin yes a gold coin could

11:09.860 --> 11:11.970
this be the first solid evidence that an

11:11.970 --> 11:14.639
incredible treasure still lies buried

11:14.639 --> 11:16.529
deep within the Oak Island money pit

11:16.529 --> 11:27.629
oh let's get some marks on the side see

11:27.629 --> 11:28.899
okay

11:28.899 --> 11:35.610
there is wording around the outside of

11:35.610 --> 11:37.480
it yeah

11:37.480 --> 11:41.310
there is a there's writing on the

11:41.310 --> 11:42.509
outside when you say my eyes are

11:42.509 --> 11:45.050
horrible I can't know all right this I

11:45.050 --> 11:46.050
gotta see

11:46.050 --> 11:49.399
yeah honest to god a coin this I think

11:49.399 --> 11:51.079
so hard a cone or a bullet I'm just

11:51.079 --> 11:53.930
marking around the inside Marty look

11:53.930 --> 12:03.149
that you say it failed friendships go

12:03.149 --> 12:05.230
out the window that's right this one

12:05.230 --> 12:06.230
some info

12:06.230 --> 12:14.389
I think it says plated how would that

12:14.389 --> 12:15.389
mean

12:15.389 --> 12:17.389
it says play it it's a boat what's it

12:17.389 --> 12:18.660
doing deep in the money pit

12:18.660 --> 12:22.149
almost the untapped it it's it's highly

12:22.149 --> 12:24.699
meaningful it's something out of place

12:24.699 --> 12:27.050
it's in the money pit very deep in an

12:27.050 --> 12:28.959
area where it shouldn't be

12:28.959 --> 12:32.779
well maybe that is a button well I don't

12:32.779 --> 12:34.019
know I mean the reason you think it's a

12:34.019 --> 12:35.429
button is because it looks like there's

12:35.429 --> 12:37.009
two like a little dimple in the booty

12:37.009 --> 12:39.819
not doesn't go through yeah the officers

12:39.819 --> 12:41.800
back in the day in the Army in the Navy

12:41.800 --> 12:44.069
in the seventeen and eighteen hundred's

12:44.069 --> 12:46.769
they used to wear nice gold-plated

12:46.769 --> 12:49.990
buttons there and if it's a button it's

12:49.990 --> 12:53.369
a couple a gold-plated British military

12:53.369 --> 12:56.420
button possibly dating to the 18th

12:56.420 --> 12:59.290
century could this be further evidence

12:59.290 --> 13:01.600
of British military activity on Oak

13:01.600 --> 13:04.239
Island in the years before the money pit

13:04.239 --> 13:08.059
was first discovered in 1795

13:08.059 --> 13:15.189
holy smokes Wow

13:15.189 --> 13:17.220
earlier this year while searching an

13:17.220 --> 13:19.360
area of the island that was once owned

13:19.360 --> 13:21.769
by a former American slave named Samuel

13:21.769 --> 13:25.540
ball the team found a number of 18th

13:25.540 --> 13:28.129
century British coins buckles and other

13:28.129 --> 13:31.009
artifacts now we've got start putting

13:31.009 --> 13:33.249
things together we've got a bottom we've

13:33.249 --> 13:35.550
got coins and this may be this is some

13:35.550 --> 13:36.550
kind of camp

13:36.550 --> 13:40.699
we are certain to zero in on something

13:40.699 --> 13:43.499
something happening here of substance in

13:43.499 --> 13:46.170
the mid 1700s Fred Nolan felt that the

13:46.170 --> 13:48.740
money pit was engineered that it was

13:48.740 --> 13:50.470
done by a disciplined group of

13:50.470 --> 13:52.610
individuals you know where are you gonna

13:52.610 --> 13:55.940
go who has all of those capabilities if

13:55.940 --> 13:59.009
you go at that time it would be military

13:59.009 --> 14:02.040
if that little gold button predates the

14:02.040 --> 14:04.499
discovery of the money pit then yeah it

14:04.499 --> 14:06.589
is the most important thing to go to the

14:06.589 --> 14:10.790
money pit since well maybe ever well the

14:10.790 --> 14:13.410
fact that you found it we're able to

14:13.410 --> 14:14.589
find like that you found it is what's

14:14.589 --> 14:18.129
amazing well you guys invited me to yeah

14:18.129 --> 14:20.760
true do you said you'd find gold by God

14:20.760 --> 14:22.179
you were supposed to find a tiny bit

14:22.179 --> 14:28.559
more than that but that's okay

14:28.559 --> 14:30.799
later that day as the excavation

14:30.799 --> 14:33.949
continues at the gaol one work site Rick

14:33.949 --> 14:36.619
Marty and members of the team take time

14:36.619 --> 14:38.929
out to welcome back two very special

14:38.929 --> 14:42.049
visitors visitors who have a profound

14:42.049 --> 14:45.230
historical connection to both Oak Island

14:45.230 --> 14:52.619
and the infamous money pit
under such

14:52.619 --> 15:00.680
circumstances but walking back sisters

15:00.680 --> 15:03.389
gene and Joan McGinnis are direct

15:03.389 --> 15:05.981
descendants of Daniel McGinnis one of

15:05.981 --> 15:08.029
the three young men who first discovered

15:08.029 --> 15:11.540
the money pit in 1795

15:11.540 --> 15:14.970
according to legend McGinnis and two of

15:14.970 --> 15:17.170
his friends were standing on the

15:17.170 --> 15:19.179
mainland when they spotted strange

15:19.179 --> 15:21.470
flickering lights on the eastern side of

15:21.470 --> 15:23.759
the island making their way across

15:23.759 --> 15:26.529
Mahone Bay in a small boat they quickly

15:26.529 --> 15:28.730
followed the lights to the base of a

15:28.730 --> 15:31.410
large oak tree once there McGinnis and

15:31.410 --> 15:34.430
his friends spotted an old pulley

15:34.430 --> 15:36.930
hanging from a branch and at the base of

15:36.930 --> 15:39.129
the tree was a large circular

15:39.129 --> 15:41.629
indentation as if the ground had been

15:41.629 --> 15:45.170
disturbed by the digging of home knowing

15:45.170 --> 15:47.079
the area to have been frequented by

15:47.079 --> 15:50.509
Spanish and Portuguese pirates the boys

15:50.509 --> 15:53.439
began to dig looking feverishly for

15:53.439 --> 15:56.799
pirate treasure for days and weeks they

15:56.799 --> 15:59.089
dug but were repeatedly astonished to

15:59.089 --> 16:01.679
find layers of wooden planks carefully

16:01.679 --> 16:05.920
laid at intervals of 10 feet

16:05.920 --> 16:10.350
now I've been told they found three

16:10.350 --> 16:12.329
treasure chests

16:12.329 --> 16:16.300
really really last year Joan gene and

16:16.300 --> 16:18.550
their younger sister Joyce journey to

16:18.550 --> 16:20.439
the island in order to share an

16:20.439 --> 16:23.679
incredible family secret this is one of

16:23.679 --> 16:25.970
the stories we were told as children

16:25.970 --> 16:29.869
Grandpa Daniel five generations ago he

16:29.869 --> 16:32.619
noticed the depression in the ground so

16:32.619 --> 16:35.009
he and his two friends started digging

16:35.009 --> 16:38.689
they found three treasure chests and

16:38.689 --> 16:41.410
what is in this box is one of the things

16:41.410 --> 16:43.199
that came from that chest

16:43.199 --> 16:47.180
oh my goodness

16:47.180 --> 16:54.720
that is quite extraordinary

16:54.720 --> 16:56.670
you know it seems seems like far longer

16:56.670 --> 16:59.839
than a year since you were last year and

16:59.839 --> 17:03.199
you know we appreciate you coming back

17:03.199 --> 17:05.569
well I I love this place

17:05.569 --> 17:09.141
it draws me it has a hold on me it's

17:09.141 --> 17:13.140
like coming home unfortunately today's

17:13.140 --> 17:15.329
visit by the McGinnis family is

17:15.329 --> 17:19.180
overshadowed by sadness in the year

17:19.180 --> 17:21.959
since their last visit Joan and jeans

17:21.959 --> 17:24.619
younger sister Joyce lost her long

17:24.619 --> 17:29.039
battle with cancer and to honor her

17:29.039 --> 17:31.820
memory Rick Marty and the team have

17:31.820 --> 17:34.120
arranged for gene and Joan to return to

17:34.120 --> 17:36.500
Oak Island in order to offer her a

17:36.500 --> 17:37.500
special tribute

17:37.500 --> 17:46.840
what is it I had choices ashes some

17:46.840 --> 17:53.860
choice analysis blowing five mmm it's

17:53.860 --> 18:00.679
beautiful a real pretty colors in it

18:00.679 --> 18:04.220
okay so ladies I think why don't we go

18:04.220 --> 18:06.399
to the McGinnis foundation and we have

18:06.399 --> 18:15.750
this memorial for Joyce okay on the

18:15.750 --> 18:19.039
western end of Oak Island Rick and

18:19.039 --> 18:21.299
members of the team arrived with Joan

18:21.299 --> 18:23.799
and Jean at the site of the old McGinnis

18:23.799 --> 18:26.480
family foundation built by Daniel

18:26.480 --> 18:29.620
McGinnis in the early 1800s so that he

18:29.620 --> 18:31.130
could live there while searching for

18:31.130 --> 18:32.200
treasure

18:32.200 --> 18:34.590
having the McGinnis sisters come back on

18:34.590 --> 18:36.760
a personal note they're part of this

18:36.760 --> 18:39.990
magic place if you will a story place so

18:39.990 --> 18:42.210
to have them come back even though

18:42.210 --> 18:44.820
albeit it's under some sad circumstances

18:44.820 --> 18:48.250
they're part of the Oak Island family

18:48.250 --> 18:49.250
and

18:49.250 --> 18:53.019
and I welcome them back so ladies this

18:53.019 --> 18:55.730
is obviously the McGinnis foundation and

18:55.730 --> 18:57.860
so why don't we walk down inside and

18:57.860 --> 18:59.640
then you can pick a stone where you'd

18:59.640 --> 19:03.260
like to place it good you don't if you

19:03.260 --> 19:05.850
want to wait there I'll come back up and

19:05.850 --> 19:07.880
get you how's that thank you

19:07.880 --> 19:10.210
for Oak Island historians the McGinnis

19:10.210 --> 19:13.929
foundation is considered hallowed ground

19:13.929 --> 19:16.070
it is so important in fact that the

19:16.070 --> 19:17.809
Canadian government has declared it

19:17.809 --> 19:19.500
strictly off-limits

19:19.500 --> 19:23.269
unless special permissions are obtained

19:23.269 --> 19:25.980
for me my thoughts when I step down into

19:25.980 --> 19:29.260
the foundation is how committed everyone

19:29.260 --> 19:32.030
that has preceded us have been they

19:32.030 --> 19:35.980
built a life around this mystery and it

19:35.980 --> 19:39.000
remains today two centuries later that

19:39.000 --> 19:43.679
connection remains I think if you'd like

19:43.679 --> 19:46.970
there's a perfect place of concealment

19:46.970 --> 19:50.460
and and place of safety right there if

19:50.460 --> 19:55.070
you'd like this it should go all the way

19:55.070 --> 19:59.210
to the back I think you might want John

19:59.210 --> 20:02.760
you might want to hold it

20:29.360 --> 20:32.179
unfortunately for Rick lagina the recent

20:32.179 --> 20:34.860
death of Joyce McGinnis is not the only

20:34.860 --> 20:39.120
loss he has suffered this year last June

20:39.120 --> 20:41.820
he received the tragic news that one of

20:41.820 --> 20:44.679
his Oak Island heroes Fred Nolan passed

20:44.679 --> 20:49.370
away how many years this map represents

20:49.370 --> 20:52.639
4050 years

20:52.639 --> 20:54.990
there is much loss associated with

20:54.990 --> 20:57.549
Fred's passing but it he lived the

20:57.549 --> 21:00.520
wonderful life he pursued his passion he

21:00.520 --> 21:03.690
contributed to the history of this place

21:03.690 --> 21:06.809
I was and am currently still saddened by

21:06.809 --> 21:08.929
his passing he will not be forgotten

21:08.929 --> 21:15.590
it's a lovely thing he does time flies

21:15.590 --> 21:21.370
Suns rise and shadows fall love is

21:21.370 --> 21:28.029
forever overall she was my best friend

21:28.029 --> 21:35.710
I'll be missing her it's very lovely

21:35.710 --> 21:39.000
she's hot now

21:39.000 --> 21:46.860
it was a touching moment leaving on the

21:46.860 --> 21:50.240
island a memento of their sister is

21:50.240 --> 21:52.149
obviously important to them and we're

21:52.149 --> 21:53.850
willing participants in that it's

21:53.850 --> 21:55.820
important to them thus it's important to

21:55.820 --> 21:56.820
us

21:56.820 --> 21:57.820
yeah we're just going to turn around and

21:57.820 --> 22:00.290
we'll head back to the museum okay okay

22:15.690 --> 22:23.460
John I think we're all excited I think

22:23.460 --> 22:26.450
we finally finally maybe after all these

22:26.450 --> 22:29.360
years we're gonna get some answers so

22:29.360 --> 22:31.640
Jean I take it that's the cross why

22:31.640 --> 22:34.760
don't we go in at the Oak Island visitor

22:34.760 --> 22:37.380
center Rick lagina and members of the

22:37.380 --> 22:39.721
team have arranged for Joan and Jean

22:39.721 --> 22:41.769
McGinnis to have expert analysis

22:41.769 --> 22:44.230
conducted on the gold cross they believe

22:44.230 --> 22:46.950
Daniel McGinnis found in the money pit

22:46.950 --> 22:53.519
more than two centuries ago dr. Lori

22:53.519 --> 23:00.159
Bergeron is an internationally renowned

23:00.159 --> 23:02.820
art and antiquities expert and former

23:02.820 --> 23:05.380
professor of art history at Pennsylvania

23:05.380 --> 23:08.649
State University for nearly two decades

23:08.649 --> 23:11.029
she has studied and identified ancient

23:11.029 --> 23:14.059
artifacts from all over the world Jean

23:14.059 --> 23:15.530
and Joan kind enough to bring the

23:15.530 --> 23:18.850
signature item related to Oak Island law

23:18.850 --> 23:21.250
history and of course that is the cross

23:21.250 --> 23:24.190
we all want answers hoping that you can

23:24.190 --> 23:26.380
weigh in on this and enlightens well

23:26.380 --> 23:29.410
let's see what we've got

23:48.110 --> 23:49.630
yeah you really do have something very

23:49.630 --> 23:52.130
interesting here ladies what we're

23:52.330 --> 23:54.610
looking at here of course is a gold

23:54.610 --> 23:57.100
cross of high carat weight probably

23:57.100 --> 24:00.030
between 22 and 24 carats what you have

24:00.030 --> 24:02.519
here is rose gold it's a Christian cross

24:02.519 --> 24:05.820
in many ways it's very Spanish colonial

24:05.820 --> 24:09.320
which indicates that it was proudly cast

24:09.320 --> 24:11.350
in the Spanish colonies which were known

24:11.350 --> 24:13.370
as the Spanish Indies at that time

24:13.370 --> 24:15.750
Mexico Peru areas like that

24:15.750 --> 24:19.419
the piece dates between 1550 and 1700

24:19.419 --> 24:23.350
the fact that it is irregularly shaped

24:23.350 --> 24:25.769
indicates that it was cast into a mold

24:25.769 --> 24:27.909
you see all the holes the holes were for

24:27.909 --> 24:31.241
emeralds then would it be your

24:31.241 --> 24:35.450
contention then that they were pried out

24:35.450 --> 24:39.090
pried out knocked out oldest oft so it's

24:39.090 --> 24:40.510
easier to get it out of a piece of gold

24:40.510 --> 24:41.900
that I might be able to get it out of a

24:41.900 --> 24:44.330
different metal there's a definite front

24:44.330 --> 24:46.759
and a back based upon the information

24:46.759 --> 24:48.879
she was providing then you could see

24:48.879 --> 24:51.809
little marks on the back you can

24:51.809 --> 24:54.080
definitely see that well I wish I had it

24:54.080 --> 24:55.650
when it was packed with emeralds but at

24:55.650 --> 24:57.309
least David see you know

24:57.309 --> 25:00.240
and what I know the the incan the South

25:00.240 --> 25:02.200
American emeralds were always still are

25:02.200 --> 25:03.200
the very bad eyes

25:03.200 --> 25:07.650
the possibility that what lies deep

25:07.650 --> 25:09.571
below the surface of Oak Island is a

25:09.571 --> 25:12.640
vast Spanish treasure hoard originally

25:12.640 --> 25:15.590
stolen from the ancient Inca is a notion

25:15.590 --> 25:17.679
that has been widely held by many Oak

25:17.679 --> 25:20.809
Island enthusiasts most notably veteran

25:20.809 --> 25:23.129
treasure hunters dan Blankenship and

25:23.129 --> 25:26.620
Fred Nolan they believe the treasure may

25:26.620 --> 25:28.740
have been buried there by the Spanish as

25:28.740 --> 25:32.389
early as the 1500s or by the British who

25:32.389 --> 25:34.379
may have stolen it from the Spanish

25:34.379 --> 25:38.370
after the Battle of Havana in 1762 could

25:38.370 --> 25:42.059
this small gold cross reportedly found

25:42.059 --> 25:45.759
in the money pit back in 1795 be proof

25:45.759 --> 25:48.769
that Dan and Fred's theory is true it's

25:48.769 --> 25:50.929
a wonderful fantastic piece of history

25:50.929 --> 25:53.110
and one which has become really the

25:53.110 --> 25:56.320
object of objects here on Oak Island yes

25:56.320 --> 25:59.530
this is our latest that's part of the

25:59.530 --> 26:02.789
miracle that it even survived yeah you

26:02.789 --> 26:06.200
have our utmost respect and thank you

26:06.200 --> 26:08.590
for for bringing a significant object

26:08.590 --> 26:11.070
forward and and to tell the story of the

26:11.070 --> 26:13.179
McGinnis family as relates Oak Island

26:13.179 --> 26:14.429
anyway thank you

26:14.429 --> 26:20.990
dr. Lurie here's a few other items that

26:20.990 --> 26:23.830
wanted you to take a look at okay in

26:23.830 --> 26:26.559
addition to the gold cross the team is

26:26.559 --> 26:29.309
hoping dr. Lori Verteron can also help

26:29.309 --> 26:31.390
identify some of the other interesting

26:31.390 --> 26:33.750
items discovered on the island earlier

26:33.750 --> 26:37.250
this year I think you'll find that quite

26:37.250 --> 26:39.190
interesting

26:39.190 --> 26:41.280
okay now this particular piece this is

26:41.280 --> 26:45.100
an 18th century tag well it's his ball

26:45.100 --> 26:49.570
right here on this test at one time was

26:49.570 --> 26:53.059
actually owned by Samuel ball skip slave

26:53.059 --> 26:55.009
who fought in the Revolutionary War when

26:55.009 --> 26:58.090
did he come here 1783 when New York was

26:58.090 --> 26:59.980
evacuated he came with the British Army

26:59.980 --> 27:01.460
I mean the fact that the Samuel ball

27:01.460 --> 27:03.240
came here and you know he made a

27:03.240 --> 27:05.450
wonderful life for himself on the island

27:05.450 --> 27:07.409
there's there's a possibility that he

27:07.409 --> 27:09.990
may have found something I don't got and

27:09.990 --> 27:12.070
that's how maybe how he acquired as well

27:12.070 --> 27:14.460
that's fascinating terrific great piece

27:14.460 --> 27:16.860
of history and one other one other piece

27:16.860 --> 27:20.539
here dr. Lurie and this is a spike

27:20.539 --> 27:28.740
look at that's nice earlier this year

27:28.740 --> 27:31.080
metal detection expert Gary Drayton

27:31.080 --> 27:33.500
along with Jack Begley and Alex lagina

27:33.500 --> 27:36.139
made an intriguing find in the Oak

27:36.139 --> 27:37.139
Island swamp

27:37.139 --> 27:39.880
that is old it's an unmade spike that's

27:39.880 --> 27:40.880
pretty good yeah

27:40.880 --> 27:45.659
those who believe that the Oak Island

27:45.659 --> 27:48.470
treasure is actually comprised of stolen

27:48.470 --> 27:50.899
artifacts from Central and South America

27:50.899 --> 27:53.640
have long theorized that the objects

27:53.640 --> 27:55.940
were brought to the island in the hold

27:55.940 --> 27:57.309
of a large sailing vessel

27:57.309 --> 28:00.940
after unloading its precious cargo the

28:00.940 --> 28:03.230
ship was likely sailed to the middle of

28:03.230 --> 28:05.649
a narrow channel that divided the east

28:05.649 --> 28:09.370
and west sides of the island then two

28:09.370 --> 28:10.990
large copper dams were most likely

28:10.990 --> 28:14.149
constructed and the seawater drained so

28:14.149 --> 28:16.080
that all evidence of the ship could be

28:16.080 --> 28:18.649
concealed in what would be a man-made

28:18.649 --> 28:22.159
swamp the very same body of water that

28:22.159 --> 28:26.350
still exists on Oak Island to this day

28:26.350 --> 28:28.700
could the spike and the fact that it was

28:28.700 --> 28:31.179
found in the swamp be evidence that this

28:31.179 --> 28:34.850
audacious theory is correct well now

28:34.850 --> 28:37.460
this I have to look into some more any

28:37.460 --> 28:39.570
ideas off the top of your head what it

28:39.570 --> 28:44.240
could be I have lots of thoughts

28:44.240 --> 28:46.230
swirling around I'm gonna take a little

28:46.230 --> 28:48.120
bit of time to look at three into this

28:48.120 --> 28:49.389
fair enough that good for you guys

28:49.389 --> 28:52.330
absolutely yeah she had not been amused

28:52.330 --> 28:56.029
by any of these artifacts she she spun

28:56.029 --> 28:58.990
them off as quickly as they were

28:58.990 --> 29:03.379
presented to her when she declines to

29:03.379 --> 29:04.759
make any sort of statement about the

29:04.759 --> 29:07.509
spike yeah of course it's very

29:07.509 --> 29:09.679
interesting we don't have a significant

29:09.679 --> 29:12.380
Spanish connection we now have a British

29:12.380 --> 29:15.100
military connection and a complete

29:15.100 --> 29:19.670
unknown yeah at least currently and so I

29:19.670 --> 29:21.510
think it's been a really good date but

29:21.510 --> 29:24.759
but but as we all know the thing is is

29:24.759 --> 29:28.179
that there are more questions yeah dr.

29:28.179 --> 29:30.340
Laurie thank you very much we appreciate

29:30.340 --> 29:32.870
all your efforts my pleasure you know

29:32.870 --> 29:35.120
without you we'd be guessing it's been

29:35.120 --> 29:38.700
now we are not thank you so a couple

29:38.700 --> 29:41.450
days and I'll get back to the fact

29:41.450 --> 29:43.740
you're intrigued yeah I think we're not

29:43.740 --> 29:48.429
all

29:48.429 --> 29:50.460
one day after the emotional and

29:50.460 --> 29:52.480
informative visit to Oak Island

29:52.480 --> 29:55.460
my sister's Jean and Joan McGinnis

29:55.460 --> 29:58.210
morning guys all right Marty lagina

29:58.210 --> 30:00.940
arrives at the money pit site to check

30:00.940 --> 30:03.110
on the progress of this year's fourth

30:03.110 --> 30:08.510
and final exploration shaft gal Juan all

30:08.510 --> 30:10.860
right talk to me where we are what are

30:10.860 --> 30:12.419
we doing what do we got

30:12.419 --> 30:14.740
we're 151 feet with the casing 150 feet

30:14.740 --> 30:16.730
of the estimation we got out of that

30:16.730 --> 30:19.809
cement like bra okay and then we got

30:19.809 --> 30:22.200
into two buckets of pure pure clay I'd

30:22.200 --> 30:24.430
be good and then we got into kind of

30:24.430 --> 30:26.640
some silky sandy clay and then fragments

30:26.640 --> 30:29.659
of wood fragments some full chunks like

30:29.659 --> 30:33.200
6x6 we got into 20 feet of clay which

30:33.200 --> 30:35.740
would indicate back to normal Oak Island

30:35.740 --> 30:37.840
conditions and then more wood which of

30:37.840 --> 30:39.799
course gets our interest level on yeah

30:39.799 --> 30:41.850
okay well we're past what Rick's

30:41.850 --> 30:43.909
objective which was the debris field so

30:43.909 --> 30:46.639
now we're looking for the Chappell vault

30:46.639 --> 30:49.360
the Blair vault but everyone call

30:49.360 --> 30:52.730
I think we keep on hitting the edge of

30:52.730 --> 30:55.440
the trouble sir I think it's

30:55.440 --> 30:57.749
we would be by all accounts right at the

30:57.749 --> 31:01.799
top of the wall yeah

31:01.799 --> 31:05.341
it was at a depth of 153 feet back in

31:05.341 --> 31:09.070
1897 that treasure hunters William

31:09.070 --> 31:10.580
Chappell and Frederick Blair drilled

31:10.580 --> 31:13.230
into what they believed to be a seven

31:13.230 --> 31:16.019
foot high wooden vault but what made the

31:16.019 --> 31:18.629
find even more exciting was that when

31:18.629 --> 31:19.889
they examined their drill bit

31:19.889 --> 31:22.549
it appeared to contain small bits of

31:22.549 --> 31:26.659
gold unfortunately when chaplain Blair

31:26.659 --> 31:28.990
later duck an enormous shaft in an

31:28.990 --> 31:31.610
effort to retrieve the vault the entire

31:31.610 --> 31:33.620
area flooded with water and collapsed

31:33.620 --> 31:41.619
and the vault has been lost ever since

31:41.619 --> 31:44.789
earlier this year Rick Marty and the

31:44.789 --> 31:46.830
team believe they'd identified the

31:46.830 --> 31:52.320
location of the Lost Chappell vault they

31:52.320 --> 31:54.090
soon became bitterly disappointed

31:54.090 --> 31:56.519
however after learning that what they

31:56.519 --> 31:59.080
had found was a searcher shaft dug by

31:59.080 --> 32:01.399
William chapels son Melbourne during his

32:01.399 --> 32:03.250
attempt to find the mysterious wooden

32:03.250 --> 32:05.309
vault back in 1931

32:05.309 --> 32:09.080
do you think this is searcher as opposed

32:09.080 --> 32:12.529
to original depositor in all probability

32:12.529 --> 32:15.340
just by the texture of it it's probably

32:15.340 --> 32:16.869
part of chakra shaft

32:16.869 --> 32:23.759
well maybe the Chappell chef just missed

32:23.759 --> 32:25.350
the capital

32:25.350 --> 32:28.610
keep digging keep digging Thanks

32:28.610 --> 32:33.200
we're on hole number four I had said

32:33.200 --> 32:35.740
before it's three strikes near oh you

32:35.740 --> 32:37.350
know we got an extra strike here and

32:37.350 --> 32:40.029
this this particular game so we're

32:40.029 --> 32:42.289
digging it we're still searching for

32:42.289 --> 32:48.320
that elusive fault after their recent

32:48.320 --> 32:51.130
find of an 18th century British military

32:51.130 --> 32:54.139
button Jack Begley and metal detection

32:54.139 --> 32:56.850
expert Gary Drayton are more determined

32:56.850 --> 32:59.450
than ever to search the gaol one spoils

32:59.450 --> 33:00.879
for possible artifacts

33:00.879 --> 33:16.740
good to see you Dave okay this should be

33:16.740 --> 33:21.809
good we're finally getting spoils that

33:21.809 --> 33:24.179
are at the depth where there could be

33:24.179 --> 33:27.399
treasure and so it's exciting

33:27.399 --> 33:28.740
as you're running the metal detector

33:28.740 --> 33:30.450
over the pile you're just waiting to

33:30.450 --> 33:34.660
hear some sort of precious metal ding

33:34.660 --> 33:36.100
because you're always hopeful that

33:36.100 --> 33:39.260
you're gonna find something good it's

33:39.260 --> 33:42.320
the money

33:42.320 --> 33:46.330
sounds good liar yeah got annoying

33:46.330 --> 33:49.450
reading but it's must be something

33:49.450 --> 33:52.590
substantial it's like a big piece of

33:52.590 --> 33:53.590
iron

33:53.590 --> 33:59.240
there's reading about 6 inches you might

33:59.240 --> 34:08.880
this is the last pilot came out so no a

34:08.880 --> 34:11.179
distinct it there's a little bit the

34:11.179 --> 34:13.270
squeaky signal yeah it's probably deep

34:13.270 --> 34:18.389
on the other part yeah

34:18.389 --> 34:22.870
what's dig everything so we're breathing

34:42.370 --> 34:47.610
the heck is they almost looks hammered

34:47.610 --> 34:48.889
that's weird

34:48.889 --> 34:50.820
Wow look and it looks like it's got a

34:50.820 --> 34:56.330
square hole in it what oh you see that

34:56.330 --> 34:58.790
looks like a square hole from the nail a

34:58.790 --> 35:01.510
square nail I think you might be right

35:01.510 --> 35:03.990
I mean look at the way it's punched out

35:03.990 --> 35:07.780
this side it's the same kind of deal

35:07.780 --> 35:08.780
yeah you're right

35:08.780 --> 35:14.030
that's a definitely old with a square

35:14.030 --> 35:18.550
hole in that yeah it's not a uniform

35:18.550 --> 35:24.290
width or depth either prior to 1800 iron

35:24.290 --> 35:26.500
nails tended to be hand forged by

35:26.500 --> 35:29.130
blacksmiths and often tapered into

35:29.130 --> 35:32.790
square shafts but what then was the

35:32.790 --> 35:36.410
purpose of this mysterious metal object

35:36.410 --> 35:38.490
could gary and jack have just found

35:38.490 --> 35:42.550
another important piece of evidence okay

35:42.550 --> 35:45.090
let's try this pile if these don't look

35:45.090 --> 35:48.390
like they've been detected as Jack and

35:48.390 --> 35:50.140
Gary resumes searching the gaol one

35:50.140 --> 35:54.090
shaft spoils for clues operations at the

35:54.090 --> 35:55.490
mud pit site continue

35:55.490 --> 36:04.690
big bro let's go see what's going on

36:04.690 --> 36:12.750
that's the biggest piece we pulled up

36:12.750 --> 36:15.050
the wall

36:15.050 --> 36:25.710
the machine and no it's not none of this

36:25.710 --> 36:36.550
is machine you can definitely has a very

36:36.550 --> 36:40.460
strong smell to it

36:40.460 --> 36:46.820
is that five inches

36:46.820 --> 36:51.590
what is it

36:51.590 --> 36:57.950
where'd it come from

36:57.950 --> 37:00.840
now we have to get the items cleaned

37:00.840 --> 37:02.941
look that dated clean all the

37:02.941 --> 37:04.870
information we can perhaps then you can

37:04.870 --> 37:07.260
make a determination or an assessment of

37:07.260 --> 37:08.390
what this may imply

37:08.390 --> 37:13.910
come on

37:13.910 --> 37:27.690
take it apart right now

37:27.690 --> 37:41.470
they're a lot bigger feet

37:41.470 --> 37:43.110
the fire oscillator

37:43.110 --> 37:47.260
might we be in the area of the fault in

37:47.260 --> 37:49.110
finding this structure it could answer

37:49.110 --> 37:51.370
the questions that have driven me since

37:51.370 --> 37:54.350
I was a little boy might answer the who

37:54.350 --> 37:56.660
might answer the win and it might answer

37:56.660 --> 38:00.330
the hollow it's big it's it's huge villa

38:00.330 --> 38:01.660
hill

38:01.660 --> 38:04.320
present maybe

38:04.320 --> 38:11.910
here dude I'd be like a black tire

38:11.910 --> 38:14.480
something to use

38:14.480 --> 38:17.520
it's possible the real ancient people's

38:17.520 --> 38:20.270
if they dug here maybe they dipped it in

38:20.270 --> 38:22.900
pine tar or something I don't know but

38:22.900 --> 38:24.980
it has a bit of a hydrocarbon spell and

38:24.980 --> 38:27.430
it's very black it looks different than

38:27.430 --> 38:31.250
the Timbers from above pine tar is a

38:31.250 --> 38:33.350
sticky substance which has been used for

38:33.350 --> 38:34.510
centuries

38:34.510 --> 38:37.230
not only as a wood preservative but also

38:37.230 --> 38:39.670
as a sealant to protect the contents of

38:39.670 --> 38:43.320
wooden structures from water

38:43.320 --> 38:51.220
where should the vault have been right

38:51.220 --> 38:54.354
here if these are the verticals while

38:54.354 --> 38:55.354
we're coming down a corner

38:55.354 --> 38:56.354
I think these things are sitting

38:56.354 --> 38:57.354
horizontal because the that's where the

38:57.354 --> 38:58.890
quick of that that's where it's digging

38:58.890 --> 38:59.890
through

38:59.890 --> 39:00.890
drive yourself crazy thinking of the

39:00.890 --> 39:02.620
possibilities it could be a timber group

39:02.620 --> 39:11.360
you know I agree but I want to see it I

39:11.360 --> 39:15.330
just say we keep advancing

39:15.330 --> 39:18.740
what are you tearing up a house down

39:18.740 --> 39:25.150
there Thanks good morning morning dear

39:25.150 --> 39:27.471
aside from finding a gold-plated button

39:27.471 --> 39:30.600
and several old wooden Timbers the

39:30.600 --> 39:32.750
team's last-ditch effort to locate the

39:32.750 --> 39:35.580
original money pit as so far yielded

39:35.580 --> 39:38.440
only modest results

39:38.440 --> 39:40.690
first we go through wood then there's a

39:40.690 --> 39:43.370
Boyd if you will or a lack of wood and

39:43.370 --> 39:45.220
then we're back into wood and then we

39:45.220 --> 39:48.350
come out of it again it shouldn't be

39:48.350 --> 39:51.200
layers of tongues but again the money

39:51.200 --> 39:54.090
pit is almost a complete unknown in

39:54.090 --> 39:56.080
which tunnels lead where what company

39:56.080 --> 39:58.870
did it were they encrypt were they roof

39:58.870 --> 40:02.910
were they floored I mean very very

40:02.910 --> 40:04.890
little information about the money pit

40:04.890 --> 40:08.070
in general

40:08.070 --> 40:12.420
one coming from tell me man tell me

40:12.420 --> 40:14.170
having worked on Oak Island for more

40:14.170 --> 40:17.160
than 40 years Dave Blankenship has

40:17.160 --> 40:19.260
extensive knowledge concerning every

40:19.260 --> 40:22.801
aspect of Oak Island and the 221 year

40:22.801 --> 40:25.940
old mystery bucket nobody knows what's

40:25.940 --> 40:27.510
down there no

40:27.510 --> 40:30.120
no father doesn't Fred did nobody can

40:30.120 --> 40:31.470
look down there

40:31.470 --> 40:34.750
it's not snow I would say that's top

40:34.750 --> 40:35.750
face roof really

40:35.750 --> 40:36.750
what

40:36.750 --> 40:54.850
the smell

40:54.850 --> 40:58.320
metal found some 150 feet deep

40:58.320 --> 40:59.320
underground

40:59.320 --> 41:02.350
could the team have just discovered a

41:02.350 --> 41:04.540
piece of a long-lost Chappell vault

41:04.540 --> 41:08.610
have they found something else perhaps

41:08.610 --> 41:11.430
something even more incredible we're

41:11.430 --> 41:21.210
getting tin now turn the roof off now

41:21.210 --> 41:28.230
what are you doing to us here Rick yes

41:28.230 --> 41:31.540
seeing what you can drill through I have

41:31.540 --> 41:33.840
no idea what the metal means we were all

41:33.840 --> 41:36.180
surprised I think we all said at the

41:36.180 --> 41:39.480
same time what's that

41:39.480 --> 41:41.150
I can't even articulate a proper

41:41.150 --> 41:45.010
response metal from that depth it's

41:45.010 --> 41:48.190
strangely modeled metal almost like it's

41:48.190 --> 41:51.780
hand hammered it has that look to it

41:51.780 --> 41:59.750
heavier than you think yeah it is

41:59.750 --> 42:00.750
everything

42:00.750 --> 42:02.890
day but they might be using it for

42:02.890 --> 42:06.630
I'm just wondering Dave the pumps they

42:06.630 --> 42:08.130
put down there

42:08.130 --> 42:10.440
did they put any kind of covers around

42:10.440 --> 42:13.060
the pumps so that I know of that has no

42:13.060 --> 42:15.000
business of being down there that I know

42:15.000 --> 42:30.100
let's get my brother's ball film about

42:30.100 --> 42:34.410
the medal

42:34.410 --> 42:47.420
hey Marty we've brought up some pretty

42:47.420 --> 42:50.200
big sheet of metals probably a foot and

42:50.200 --> 42:52.110
a half by a foot and a half no it's a

42:52.110 --> 43:00.780
bit baffling so why don't you come on up

43:00.780 --> 43:04.210
which is interesting

43:04.210 --> 43:11.070
they've always said well charcoal being

43:11.070 --> 43:17.920
down there various levels with that

43:17.920 --> 43:24.780
could you misinterpret that is charcoal

43:24.780 --> 43:25.780
this is that huge chunk of it

43:25.780 --> 43:26.780
Terkel

43:26.780 --> 43:27.780
in 1804 as members of the Onslow company

43:27.780 --> 43:29.670
began excavating the money pit they

43:29.670 --> 43:31.430
reported finding large amounts of

43:31.430 --> 43:34.380
charcoal at a depth of approximately 30

43:34.380 --> 43:37.250
feet the searchers speculated that they

43:37.250 --> 43:40.160
had found evidence of an old furnace

43:40.160 --> 43:41.950
which would have been used to draw air

43:41.950 --> 43:43.940
down into the pit for the workers who

43:43.940 --> 43:48.940
constructed the original treasure vaults

43:48.940 --> 43:50.850
is it possible that the strange pieces

43:50.850 --> 43:53.190
of metal the team is pulling up from the

43:53.190 --> 43:55.440
bottom of the galones shaft are the

43:55.440 --> 43:57.540
remains of an abandoned searcher furnace

43:57.540 --> 44:02.470
we should have this look at it we've

44:02.470 --> 44:05.580
found intriguing objects metal the

44:05.580 --> 44:08.450
charcoal like rocks I'll call them

44:08.450 --> 44:11.590
there's enough clues if you will there

44:11.590 --> 44:16.190
to say we've got to explore this further

44:16.190 --> 44:22.340
this is that you grab it don't grab that

44:22.340 --> 44:29.490
piece heavier than it looks isn't Wow

44:29.490 --> 44:35.780
now that does not look modern do we know

44:35.780 --> 44:41.620
what precise depth this came from you

44:41.620 --> 44:43.040
01:54

44:43.040 --> 44:48.080
a metal plate discovered 154 feet deep

44:48.080 --> 44:51.520
in the money pit area

44:51.520 --> 44:53.410
it was almost at the same depth that

44:53.410 --> 44:55.280
treasure hunters William Chappell and

44:55.280 --> 44:57.680
Frederick Blair reported finding

44:57.680 --> 44:59.530
evidence of a seven-foot high wooden

44:59.530 --> 45:03.940
vault back in 1897 but when they tried

45:03.940 --> 45:06.230
to drill deeper they're drilled it was

45:06.230 --> 45:08.180
stopped by what they thought was a

45:08.180 --> 45:12.050
mysterious metal plate located some 171

45:12.050 --> 45:16.070
feet underground but the metal object or

45:16.070 --> 45:18.500
Dinah's found actually be a piece of

45:18.500 --> 45:21.550
this plate or does it suggest that much

45:21.550 --> 45:23.390
of what they believed about the Chappell

45:23.390 --> 45:28.930
vault was only partly true described

45:28.930 --> 45:33.030
well it could be the impenetrable thing

45:33.030 --> 45:34.190
where the auger bit stopped

45:34.190 --> 45:36.080
couldn't it that's where they couldn't

45:36.080 --> 45:37.940
get through something it's within a few

45:37.940 --> 45:40.180
feet yeah so we have torqued that with

45:40.180 --> 45:42.770
the oscillator you cannot move it left

45:42.770 --> 45:45.610
to right it anymore the emotions that

45:45.610 --> 45:50.120
gal won have suddenly turned serious

45:50.120 --> 45:52.450
it seems the drilling caisson has come

45:52.450 --> 45:54.570
upon a metal object that it cannot

45:54.570 --> 45:55.640
penetrate

45:55.640 --> 45:57.290
there's too much negative skin friction

45:57.290 --> 46:05.810
on the ball that actually turned it any

46:05.810 --> 46:06.810
more

46:06.810 --> 46:10.400
oh wait a minute we're like on the verge

46:10.400 --> 46:17.710
of something exciting and we're

46:17.710 --> 46:21.830
we have torque that with the oscillator

46:21.830 --> 46:22.830
what does that mean to you

46:22.830 --> 46:23.830
that means they can't go further with

46:23.830 --> 46:25.550
the case here

46:25.550 --> 46:29.330
it is a tense situation on Oak Island

46:29.330 --> 46:31.390
after finding large pieces of a

46:31.390 --> 46:33.460
mysterious metal in the exploration

46:33.460 --> 46:37.570
shaft known as gal one the massive 58

46:37.570 --> 46:40.110
ton steel drilling caisson has hit what

46:40.110 --> 46:43.290
seems to be an impenetrable metal object

46:43.290 --> 46:48.320
at a depth of approximately 154 feet the

46:48.320 --> 46:51.010
casing is Stockton the oscillator cake

46:51.010 --> 46:53.950
will be donated for so that's very

46:53.950 --> 46:57.170
disturbing is it possible that Rick

46:57.170 --> 47:00.350
Marty Craig and the team have found the

47:00.350 --> 47:02.750
same large metal obstruction that

47:02.750 --> 47:04.330
treasure hunter William Chappell

47:04.330 --> 47:10.490
described back in 1897 could the team

47:10.490 --> 47:13.370
have located an actual treasure vault

47:13.370 --> 47:16.520
and really what might be happening is if

47:16.520 --> 47:18.350
there is bedrock that we were commenting

47:18.350 --> 47:20.400
on he's pushing on the rock and trying

47:20.400 --> 47:21.730
to turn it then you got the negative

47:21.730 --> 47:24.280
skin friction working against it is

47:24.280 --> 47:27.650
there any way we can get any deeper than

47:27.650 --> 47:30.710
where we are right now yeah it's

47:30.710 --> 47:31.710
possible

47:31.710 --> 47:32.710
the key could advance another five feet

47:32.710 --> 47:33.710
and we could hammer grab another five

47:33.710 --> 47:36.500
feet that'd be ideal

47:36.500 --> 47:39.840
so one now and chisel past the underside

47:39.840 --> 47:40.840
of the can break up all we can get and

47:40.840 --> 47:44.490
go in with a smaller graph and pluck it

47:44.490 --> 47:48.200
whatever broke up okay let's see how

47:48.200 --> 47:49.790
this works good

47:49.790 --> 47:51.700
in an effort to penetrate the metal

47:51.700 --> 47:54.660
obstruction the team has decided to use

47:54.660 --> 47:57.830
what is known as a chisel bet a four-ton

47:57.830 --> 48:01.150
column made of steel it will be used as

48:01.150 --> 48:03.090
a type of vertical battering ram

48:03.090 --> 48:06.230
alternatively raised and lowered until

48:06.230 --> 48:09.330
the object in its path can be removed

48:09.330 --> 48:12.610
if for some reason the chisel bit cannot

48:12.610 --> 48:15.020
break through the entire money pit

48:15.020 --> 48:17.150
operation on Oak Island may just

48:17.150 --> 48:20.940
literally have ground to a halt so will

48:20.940 --> 48:25.390
will five more feet from where we are

48:25.390 --> 48:28.160
yeah I mean it unless you know we just

48:28.160 --> 48:30.740
start bringing up nothing but if we keep

48:30.740 --> 48:33.000
on bringing up water especially metal in

48:33.000 --> 48:34.290
the combination of those

48:34.290 --> 48:37.031
you know yeah yeah I'm hoping that we do

48:37.031 --> 48:38.400
this something

48:38.400 --> 48:44.793
all right well I want to see it good

48:44.793 --> 48:45.793
while the team's efforts to penetrate

48:45.793 --> 48:47.900
the large metal obstruction continue at

48:47.900 --> 48:52.030
the gaol one exploration site

48:52.030 --> 48:54.550
Rick lagina and Jack Begley head over to

48:54.550 --> 48:59.571
the home of dan Blankenship they have

48:59.571 --> 49:01.731
just received news that dr. Laurie

49:01.731 --> 49:04.360
Verteron has completed her analysis of

49:04.360 --> 49:06.900
the large iron spike that was found in

49:06.900 --> 49:10.830
the swamp earlier this year you have

49:10.830 --> 49:12.660
some answers I have some answers for you

49:12.660 --> 49:16.760
jack the spike has spoken volumes really

49:16.760 --> 49:20.950
yeah the spike is a wrought iron spike

49:20.950 --> 49:23.290
it was the type that were used called a

49:23.290 --> 49:26.430
burrow Tate type which in Spanish just

49:26.430 --> 49:29.670
means iron bar and a burrow daze type

49:29.670 --> 49:31.770
spike would have been similar to a

49:31.770 --> 49:35.080
finishing nail on a Spanish galleon ship

49:35.080 --> 49:40.760
that is interesting these particular

49:40.760 --> 49:43.170
spikes in a way they would be used the

49:43.170 --> 49:45.250
keel of a Spanish galleon would be made

49:45.250 --> 49:48.830
of oak the mass would be made of pine

49:48.830 --> 49:51.040
and then the decks would be made of a

49:51.040 --> 49:53.820
hardwood and then these would be driven

49:53.820 --> 49:56.390
in fact into the decks you don't need a

49:56.390 --> 49:58.960
lot of strength to use one of these the

49:58.960 --> 50:01.730
spike does all the work for you and

50:01.730 --> 50:03.810
these are very similar to those that

50:03.810 --> 50:06.630
have been found all along the Florida

50:06.630 --> 50:09.110
Keys Treasure Coast particularly the

50:09.110 --> 50:12.710
Treasure Coast of Florida all right it

50:12.710 --> 50:14.020
confirms what Gary first thought when he

50:14.020 --> 50:15.830
found it I mean he's found hundreds of

50:15.830 --> 50:18.300
these well the Treasure Coast and your

50:18.300 --> 50:22.140
expertise just confirmed it exactly so

50:22.140 --> 50:25.820
how did you arrive at that conclusion

50:25.820 --> 50:28.050
compare and contrast what does it look

50:28.050 --> 50:30.170
like what doesn't it look like with

50:30.170 --> 50:32.550
similar ones so you compared and

50:32.550 --> 50:35.140
contrasted this with similar ones that

50:35.140 --> 50:37.530
have been confirmed that they are deck

50:37.530 --> 50:40.990
spikes exactly what differentiates this

50:40.990 --> 50:43.010
from being a railroad spike what is the

50:43.010 --> 50:44.850
difference well the difference has to do

50:44.850 --> 50:46.220
with the way in which the iron is

50:46.220 --> 50:49.050
wrought and also has to do with in fact

50:49.050 --> 50:51.140
the form and the size if the thing for

50:51.140 --> 50:54.950
me is on a railroad spike there's always

50:54.950 --> 50:58.030
a little nose piece which this relaxed

50:58.030 --> 51:01.190
to catch the plate yeah that's what I

51:01.190 --> 51:04.050
was looking for but as she said the

51:04.050 --> 51:06.600
spikes that they use and wood plank him

51:06.600 --> 51:09.150
the wood planking was probably 2 inch or

51:09.150 --> 51:11.230
more that would be just perfect through

51:11.230 --> 51:16.560
2 inches blanket this is ship not train

51:16.560 --> 51:18.680
yeah in the fact that Fred Nolan found

51:18.680 --> 51:21.100
parts of a ship buried in the swamp

51:21.100 --> 51:26.370
you're kidding I'm not kidding you

51:26.370 --> 51:28.290
Oak Island landowner and treasure hunter

51:28.290 --> 51:31.460
Fred Nolan was convinced that one of the

51:31.460 --> 51:34.340
keys to solving the mystery was located

51:34.340 --> 51:36.160
beneath the surface of the swamp

51:36.160 --> 51:39.220
what were the things that you found in

51:39.220 --> 51:42.930
this swamp well we found parts of a ship

51:42.930 --> 51:46.020
the ratlines have a ship the city is

51:46.020 --> 51:49.250
where the ropes went through and this

51:49.250 --> 51:51.640
shows the scuppers on the side of a ship

51:51.640 --> 51:54.580
how far from the beach were these items

51:54.580 --> 51:55.940
fall into your call

51:55.940 --> 51:57.850
they were pretty well in the middle of

51:57.850 --> 51:59.470
the swamp and we found a number of

51:59.470 --> 52:01.880
survey stakes in the swamp what do you

52:01.880 --> 52:04.230
make of that well whoever laid over the

52:04.230 --> 52:08.770
swamp they did it to hide something my

52:08.770 --> 52:10.220
guide if you will tells me there's

52:10.220 --> 52:13.490
something in this I can't let go of that

52:13.490 --> 52:17.830
the swamp is important no question about

52:17.830 --> 52:20.010
it

52:20.010 --> 52:22.190
French theory was given more credibility

52:22.190 --> 52:24.600
earlier this year when prior to the

52:24.600 --> 52:27.210
discovery of the iron spike the team

52:27.210 --> 52:30.210
also found an 18 foot long wooden plank

52:30.210 --> 52:40.940
wow it's huge looks like a piece of wood

52:40.940 --> 52:43.170
it was also near the same area of the

52:43.170 --> 52:45.831
swamp that three years ago the team

52:45.831 --> 52:49.010
located a 17th century Spanish coin is

52:49.010 --> 52:54.300
it a coin I believe this is a coin the

52:54.300 --> 52:59.560
coin was Spanish yeah how old 1652

52:59.560 --> 53:01.920
what's the window on this I think this

53:01.920 --> 53:08.070
is earlier the coin was Spanish yeah how

53:08.070 --> 53:12.150
old 1652 what's the window on this piece

53:12.150 --> 53:18.400
dates about 1575 to about 1600 yes if

53:18.400 --> 53:22.190
that's true it's in the best damn era

53:22.190 --> 53:26.340
that it could ever be yet at the home of

53:26.340 --> 53:27.980
Oak Island treasure hunter dan

53:27.980 --> 53:31.250
Blankenship antiquities expert dr.

53:31.250 --> 53:34.060
Laurie Verteron has just revealed that

53:34.060 --> 53:36.250
the strange metal spike found earlier

53:36.250 --> 53:38.680
this year in the Oak Island swamp was

53:38.680 --> 53:41.351
most likely a piece from a 16th century

53:41.351 --> 53:44.530
Spanish galleon if that spike is really

53:44.530 --> 53:47.060
from the 1500s from a Spanish galleon

53:47.060 --> 53:49.390
that would ratchet up things maybe the

53:49.390 --> 53:50.780
same thing as the coin

53:50.780 --> 53:54.310
couldn't walk away stronger even

53:54.310 --> 53:56.380
stronger the date would be more

53:56.380 --> 53:59.570
significant I think it's it's

53:59.570 --> 54:01.520
mind-boggling you think that there's a

54:01.520 --> 54:03.630
Spanish galleon associated with Oak

54:03.630 --> 54:08.580
Island this object is not going to be

54:08.580 --> 54:12.470
too far into the 1600s your coin was

54:12.470 --> 54:16.730
1652 yeah it's the same time period but

54:16.730 --> 54:18.150
that coin might be a little late you

54:18.150 --> 54:20.840
don't think they celebrate one another

54:20.840 --> 54:24.640
yes that they're all Spanish the coin

54:24.640 --> 54:27.160
now speaks to a culture which is

54:27.160 --> 54:30.120
terrific

54:30.120 --> 54:31.490
beginning with the expedition of

54:31.490 --> 54:35.300
Christopher Columbus in 1492 the Spanish

54:35.300 --> 54:37.070
Empire would spend the next three

54:37.070 --> 54:40.160
centuries exploring colonizing and

54:40.160 --> 54:43.140
plundering large areas of North Central

54:43.140 --> 54:45.080
and South America

54:45.080 --> 54:47.930
during this period it is reported that

54:47.930 --> 54:50.600
conquistadors confiscated billions of

54:50.600 --> 54:53.310
dollars worth of gold silver and

54:53.310 --> 54:55.430
precious gems from various native

54:55.430 --> 54:58.910
cultures most notably the Aztec and Inca

54:58.910 --> 55:01.490
empires

55:01.490 --> 55:04.280
that's been my theory all along yeah I

55:04.280 --> 55:08.350
mean to me it makes common sense yeah

55:08.350 --> 55:14.490
every ship that sailed to Spain that was

55:14.490 --> 55:17.670
loaded with with gold and silver

55:17.670 --> 55:24.800
the captain's only got about 15% of it

55:24.800 --> 55:27.740
so it's not hard to theorize that a

55:27.740 --> 55:30.460
group of these captains probably got

55:30.460 --> 55:33.020
together and saying why should we give

55:33.020 --> 55:36.060
all of this gold and silver to the king

55:36.060 --> 55:37.060
of Spain

55:37.060 --> 55:40.510
or we're the ones taking the risk common

55:40.510 --> 55:42.510
sense says who the hell's you want to

55:42.510 --> 55:44.620
settle for 15% when they can get a

55:44.620 --> 55:54.770
hundred percent
so you're a hundred

55:54.770 --> 55:56.311
percent sure that this came from a

55:56.311 --> 55:58.440
Spanish guy I'm 100% sure this came from

55:58.440 --> 56:00.820
a Spanish galleon all right definitive

56:00.820 --> 56:03.660
proof there you go exactly Jake this

56:03.660 --> 56:06.210
gives us an idea that the Spanish were

56:06.210 --> 56:08.850
here and probably crashed a ship in the

56:08.850 --> 56:10.980
swamp or someone got one of their ships

56:10.980 --> 56:13.460
and brought it here when will we have

56:13.460 --> 56:15.560
enough information to be able to do a

56:15.560 --> 56:18.370
big dig in the swamp well it's more a

56:18.370 --> 56:20.630
regulatory process I mean we have to

56:20.630 --> 56:23.100
define a hard target you know given

56:23.100 --> 56:25.180
wetlands considerations and that type of

56:25.180 --> 56:28.100
thing now if we hard targeted some sort

56:28.100 --> 56:30.160
of wooden structure in the swamp

56:30.160 --> 56:33.660
absolutely yeah I think if we were to

56:33.660 --> 56:37.170
apply for such a permit we have a story

56:37.170 --> 56:39.520
line which has developed we have the

56:39.520 --> 56:40.520
spike have the wood

56:40.520 --> 56:44.080
of the coin we have Fred's discovery of

56:44.080 --> 56:46.640
the ship scuppers I mean we have now a

56:46.640 --> 56:50.180
legitimate line of inquiry to propose to

56:50.180 --> 56:52.090
them that hey this is what we're looking

56:52.090 --> 56:53.090
for

56:53.090 --> 56:55.670
yeah well I've always said it's a

56:55.670 --> 56:57.650
treasure hunt in information hunt and

56:57.650 --> 56:59.160
not only have you provided more

56:59.160 --> 57:02.130
information but you've introduced us to

57:02.130 --> 57:04.630
perhaps in the storyline this is a great

57:04.630 --> 57:06.730
story of history Rick it's a lot of fun

57:06.730 --> 57:10.460
for me so I thank you thank you it's

57:10.460 --> 57:12.800
very intriguing absolutely no question

57:12.800 --> 57:16.220
about that

57:16.220 --> 57:18.170
back at the money Patti

57:18.170 --> 57:20.070
Marty lagina joins his partner Craig

57:20.070 --> 57:22.350
tester to get an update on the team's

57:22.350 --> 57:26.260
progress well is it time to do her happy

57:26.260 --> 57:27.260
dance

57:27.260 --> 57:29.740
ah getting close he went in with the

57:29.740 --> 57:31.174
chisel pound it out so he could get some

57:31.174 --> 57:32.174
more grabs so at least we're getting a

57:32.174 --> 57:33.174
little bit deeper here and seeing when

57:33.174 --> 57:34.174
we come up

57:34.174 --> 57:38.980
can move the can or she's done it yeah

57:38.980 --> 57:42.240
we are stalled with the can 100% stop

57:42.240 --> 57:44.850
all right well nothing new came up in

57:44.850 --> 57:45.850
the interim

57:45.850 --> 57:48.460
they're here for the first bucket I also

57:48.460 --> 57:51.581
go with a smaller graph just to make

57:51.581 --> 57:56.100
sure

57:56.100 --> 57:57.900
having successfully chiseled through the

57:57.900 --> 58:00.600
metal obstruction the team is now ready

58:00.600 --> 58:03.150
to begin removing additional spoils from

58:03.150 --> 58:06.360
gaol one but rather than using the large

58:06.360 --> 58:08.640
eight ton hammer grab tool they have

58:08.640 --> 58:11.030
chosen to switch to a smaller more

58:11.030 --> 58:12.930
surgical three ton device

58:12.930 --> 58:16.360
there was a natural or man-made chamber

58:16.360 --> 58:17.710
and it's got things in it we're

58:17.710 --> 58:19.170
interested in we need to grab them all

58:19.170 --> 58:21.050
so we kept going with a handle grab

58:21.050 --> 58:23.420
which is somewhat risky because it can

58:23.420 --> 58:25.730
get stuck below the pipe or certainly

58:25.730 --> 58:28.020
below the room of that hole so what

58:28.020 --> 58:29.620
we're gonna do is go as far as we can

58:29.620 --> 58:32.230
with that and grab whatever it is that

58:32.230 --> 58:35.690
filled that chamber

58:35.690 --> 58:37.280
suddenly

58:37.280 --> 58:51.560
you guys want that in the bucket or on

58:51.560 --> 59:01.080
the ground the hell was that

59:01.080 --> 59:03.910
while searching for the location of the

59:03.910 --> 59:06.780
original Oak Island money pit the team

59:06.780 --> 59:08.940
has just retrieved another mysterious

59:08.940 --> 59:12.550
metal object from the 155-foot deep

59:12.550 --> 59:15.920
exploration shop known as gal WAN

59:15.920 --> 59:21.100
metal corner plate it looks like

59:21.100 --> 59:22.830
corner plate

59:22.830 --> 59:27.160
that's heavier steel to it

59:27.160 --> 59:35.900
there were odd things coming up the

59:35.900 --> 59:38.010
plate was the whole side that could be

59:38.010 --> 59:40.170
original stuff you know it looked like

59:40.170 --> 59:41.810
hammered metal it didn't look at all

59:41.810 --> 59:43.860
modern and the holes don't look like

59:43.860 --> 59:46.060
they're cut very cleanly they didn't

59:46.060 --> 59:49.570
have any of sort of modern look to it so

59:49.570 --> 59:51.430
this is getting pretty exciting scene

59:51.430 --> 59:54.700
right there she'll find that seam is the

59:54.700 --> 59:57.280
whole way yeah and right here and then

59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.951
again you can see it right there yeah

01:00:00.951 --> 01:00:01.951
but you're right it does have that

01:00:01.951 --> 01:00:04.190
hammered finish to it yeah those

01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:06.450
old-timers Craig landed on plate steel

01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:07.450
that thick they wouldn't got through it

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:08.450
look at all these marks

01:00:08.450 --> 01:00:09.450
it's from the amber drug no I don't

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:14.990
think so

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:22.800
still not sure you know what it is so we

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.280
need to get it sent out we need to get

01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:27.330
it tested looking for impurities

01:00:27.330 --> 01:00:30.000
what's it composed of and all that will

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.860
help determine the age of it and then

01:00:32.860 --> 01:00:34.960
that'll help us you know start coming up

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.460
with ideas of what it might be for

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:40.630
it's thicker than the other metal

01:00:40.630 --> 01:00:44.680
and he was noticing you can see his seem

01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:46.190
like it's pattern-welded stuff

01:00:46.190 --> 01:00:50.460
I don't know what that's got to get

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:54.570
tested and I mean look at all these

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:55.600
patterns on

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.150
that came up

01:00:57.150 --> 01:01:00.370
there's gonna find all kinds stop there

01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:01.890
now

01:01:01.890 --> 01:01:06.120
that one big thick washer just looked

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:08.760
ancient to me seem to be like hammered

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.810
layered metal fits that whole burger

01:01:10.810 --> 01:01:11.810
that's the wash

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:16.420
yeah it's worth long why do you need a

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.630
washer you're just going into wood

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.780
it was strong enough stuff to have been

01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.480
some sort of casing some sort of chamber

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.440
so it could have been almost like a

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.320
chest bump a big one covered in metal or

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.700
plated with metal and inside it would've

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:33.960
been an ideal way to encase something

01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:35.090
for a long long time

01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:40.340
what the heck is going on

01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.370
good Rick Marty and their partners have

01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.710
finally located the so-called Chappell

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:48.370
vault or perhaps even the money pit

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:52.220
itself some 160 feet deep underground

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:56.730
one thing is certain the metal object

01:01:56.730 --> 01:01:59.840
found in gal Wan is proof of man-made

01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.790
activity and doesn't match the

01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:04.460
description of any of the objects known

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:06.840
to be used in previous documented

01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840
searches

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.180
citizens

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.910
we look carefully through each hammer

01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:15.580
grip fact we had lots of help from the

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.510
crew could there be a coin could there

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:19.160
be that piece of gold that's what we

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:24.010
were looking for every time those guys

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:27.670
treasure hunters you find a coin in your

01:02:27.670 --> 01:02:33.330
remodel your bathroom what was

01:02:33.330 --> 01:02:35.970
intriguing about it is how invested the

01:02:35.970 --> 01:02:38.330
crew was and it's what's happens here on

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:41.360
Oak Island even if you're only somewhat

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.520
associated with the search you buy in

01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.930
and you want to find something

01:02:44.930 --> 01:02:49.590
I've got another item for your mystery

01:02:49.590 --> 01:02:53.460
bag that would be a nut it just looks

01:02:53.460 --> 01:02:56.420
like some real primitive stuff my

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.310
goodness we're down 160 feet now it's

01:02:59.310 --> 01:03:01.180
very very exciting because there were

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:04.210
odd things coming up and they did look

01:03:04.210 --> 01:03:06.580
very old it's just awesome that people

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.730
were down there without modern

01:03:07.730 --> 01:03:10.080
technology underground working this

01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:15.110
doesn't make sense to me more nuts the

01:03:15.110 --> 01:03:17.470
georgia dan lagina for at least isn't

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.900
disappointing thank you mom and dad

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:29.600
she'll go down and give her a smash

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:36.120
be careful you don't get caught

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.300
underneath the

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:41.270
so guys we're past the bottom of the can

01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:43.540
down by about a foot and a half I

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.260
thought you didn't want to do it don't

01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:47.490
it's the top of the jar I don't want to

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.560
get lodged underneath the law so we go

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:54.500
another foot or something why am I here

01:03:54.500 --> 01:04:29.380
now it's just a matter of the limited I

01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:30.380
ever

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:31.380
watch yourself guys

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:32.380
sure

01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.380
what's a Michelle why not what's picking

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.950
up there yeah we're going through sort

01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.300
of a is there yeah talking to God

01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.770
while trying to retrieve additional and

01:04:39.770 --> 01:04:42.060
potentially valuable artifacts from the

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:45.750
exploration shaft known as gaol one the

01:04:45.750 --> 01:04:47.830
three ton hammer grab device has

01:04:47.830 --> 01:04:50.280
suddenly become stuck on an object at

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.790
the bottom of the hole

01:04:52.790 --> 01:04:55.620
we're at 160 feet with a hole right now

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:58.880
just got the hammer caught

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.020
on what I don't know that we're gonna

01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.410
try to get it out right we've reached a

01:05:03.410 --> 01:05:06.200
depth where we've found intriguing

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.150
objects frustrating thing is the hammer

01:05:09.150 --> 01:05:13.070
grab has gone far beyond the bottom of

01:05:13.070 --> 01:05:15.320
the casing and in fact Andrews saying

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.890
he's a little bit worried that he can

01:05:17.890 --> 01:05:21.220
pull it out hey Michelle one more time

01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.620
but be careful let's just go down and

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:24.620
close the bucket and come up

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:29.110
if the team can't retrieve the hammer

01:05:29.110 --> 01:05:31.550
grab tool they will have no choice but

01:05:31.550 --> 01:05:33.950
to suspend their search operation at the

01:05:33.950 --> 01:05:37.830
money pit

01:05:43.330 --> 01:05:48.010
so that's a positive

01:05:55.610 --> 01:05:58.580
what do you think we hit there I don't

01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.110
know I'm hoping there's two different

01:06:00.110 --> 01:06:01.780
things there I'm hoping that it's the

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:03.860
corner the Chappell shaft and maybe a

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.320
piece of the old vault

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.700
the Chappell shaft the original money

01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:11.670
pit vault

01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:14.120
after 10 long years of planning and

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:16.790
searching a trick Marty and the Oak

01:06:16.790 --> 01:06:19.480
Island team finally reached their target

01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:22.790
have they found the exact spot where a

01:06:22.790 --> 01:06:25.400
mysterious treasure was buried centuries

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.940
ago

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:30.200
with possible success just a few feet

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:33.200
away the team must make a difficult

01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.880
decision if they continue with the

01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:38.410
hammer gram device they may lose it in

01:06:38.410 --> 01:06:41.390
the hole and even if losing valuable

01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:44.100
equipment wasn't a factor protecting the

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.960
integrity of the metal object they've

01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:47.920
encountered is a key concern

01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:53.480
my thought is we're out of the ground

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.720
right now with the hammer grab we go

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.550
back in we don't know if it's coming out

01:06:58.550 --> 01:06:59.550
again

01:06:59.550 --> 01:07:01.800
you know walk us in with us as much as

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.350
I'd love to go in when we're trying to

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:05.950
come up with a queen or something I

01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:07.130
don't think it's worth it

01:07:07.130 --> 01:07:08.590
he's well beyond his comfort level you

01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:09.710
don't want to write I am concerned the

01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:13.910
next one might be the one that gets

01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:20.520
stuck or comes up with the bars

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.160
I think we may get some answers from

01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:27.040
that metal

01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:29.462
we have materials to test have materials

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.080
to test me we're gonna mark this spot we

01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.590
can get right back down there how hard

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.870
would be if we wanted to reenter that

01:07:34.870 --> 01:07:36.860
spot it would go really fast yeah

01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:38.860
absolutely well then we can always get

01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:39.860
back there

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:42.820
I say we know more about the money pit

01:07:42.820 --> 01:07:47.170
than anybody on earth right now we've

01:07:47.170 --> 01:07:49.380
found something that probably hasn't

01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:52.631
been found before say that let's declare

01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:55.970
victory and go home no can we just

01:07:55.970 --> 01:08:00.130
declare victory sure Andrew crank the

01:08:00.130 --> 01:08:03.560
horses up and let's get out of the hole

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:06.560
here absolutely we're done agreed agreed

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.560
agreed

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:10.220
yeah good after the decision has been

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.800
made the team will hold off on trying to

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.960
retrieve additional artifacts from

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.920
Galois at least until they can weigh

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:30.020
their options

01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.520
so you meant with dr. Lurie regarding

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.501
those artifacts we found in gaol one

01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:35.810
right we did she came here or she looked

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.859
at certain items but she wanted to take

01:08:37.859 --> 01:08:41.020
some more time three days after the team

01:08:41.020 --> 01:08:43.460
decided to suspend operations at the

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:46.060
money pit site they have gathered in the

01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:48.580
war room to find out if any of the

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:51.149
objects they've retrieved so far could

01:08:51.149 --> 01:08:54.130
reasonably be dated to a period before

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:57.819
1795 the year the original money pit was

01:08:57.819 --> 01:09:01.620
first discovered she ready do if we have

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:06.120
a standby so why don't we get her on

01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:12.250
television here and see what she has to

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:14.979
say it sounds great

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:18.189
dr. Laurie joining the team once again

01:09:18.189 --> 01:09:21.090
this time via video conference is

01:09:21.090 --> 01:09:23.399
antiquities expert dr. Laurie Verteron

01:09:23.399 --> 01:09:25.779
dr. Laura the last time we spoke you

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:27.620
wanted to take some time to look at

01:09:27.620 --> 01:09:30.470
several of the items and we're hoping

01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:32.680
that we can get some feedback from you

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.220
we'd love to hear what you think how

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.281
about the button I'm interested in the

01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:41.520
but we don't cool all right this I gotta

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:42.520
see

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.250
honest to god the coin out of this

01:09:44.250 --> 01:09:47.270
spoils pot I don't know if it's a coin

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:48.270
or a bowl

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:49.270
is it possible just plated hell would

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:50.270
that mean it says play and it's a book

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:51.270
the button that was found in the money

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:52.310
pit says plated on it and the word

01:09:52.310 --> 01:09:53.310
plated is very clear and plated buttons

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:54.311
like those used to have the word guilt

01:09:54.311 --> 01:09:55.311
on them GI LT and guilt actually

01:09:55.311 --> 01:09:57.250
indicated that the piece was in fact in

01:09:57.250 --> 01:10:07.010
some way gilded similar buttons were

01:10:07.010 --> 01:10:20.020
found about 1775 to about 1812 1815 on

01:10:20.020 --> 01:10:23.260
military uniforms of the British what's

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:24.880
it doing in the money pit Charles Marty

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:25.880
I have no idea

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.960
add that depth could this gold-plated

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.770
button be evidence that members of the

01:10:32.770 --> 01:10:34.650
British military could have been the

01:10:34.650 --> 01:10:37.530
ones behind the Oak Island mystery or

01:10:37.530 --> 01:10:40.640
might it simply be an indication that

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.900
English officers having learned that a

01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:44.510
vast treasure had been buried on the

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:47.120
island lost one of their buttons while

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:49.540
searching for it

01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:50.910
it's based on some of the other things

01:10:50.910 --> 01:10:52.420
that were in the money pit which also

01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:54.920
date to the same origin dr. Lurie gave

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.250
an opinion that the button was related

01:10:57.250 --> 01:11:01.000
to perhaps British military and you know

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.230
that runs through some belief that fred

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:05.230
was onto something that mr. Nolan's

01:11:05.230 --> 01:11:08.880
theory of British involvement perhaps

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.480
that that's what this Oak Island mystery

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.650
is about I mean it certainly lends

01:11:14.650 --> 01:11:18.700
credibility to it that was relatively

01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:22.000
interesting this is dr. Lori's this what

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000
you're speaking of that's what I'm

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:28.130
speaking of it's a piece that is pretty

01:11:28.130 --> 01:11:32.010
fascinating so here's what you have

01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:33.010
there

01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:35.100
that B's is decorative and if you look

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.110
at those hinges

01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:38.480
they actually have drill holes there are

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:40.580
several drill holes in it right yeah

01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:45.710
they're also used to actually attach the

01:11:45.710 --> 01:11:50.150
metal or wooden sides of treasure chests

01:11:50.150 --> 01:11:52.450
treasure chests did dr. Laurie just

01:11:52.450 --> 01:11:54.580
present the team with further evidence

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.680
that the mysterious metal object at the

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:59.670
bottom of gaol one is one of the keys to

01:11:59.670 --> 01:12:01.460
solving the Oak Island mystery

01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:05.000
the very object that people have been

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.230
looking for and dying for for more than

01:12:08.230 --> 01:12:12.530
two centuries well well you can envision

01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:13.980
that particular piece sort of going

01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:14.980
around the side of a treasure chest I

01:12:14.980 --> 01:12:17.200
would say that it's much more possible

01:12:17.200 --> 01:12:21.590
that that particular piece relates to a

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:24.720
ship I think they were reclaiming pieces

01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.600
and reusing pieces in the money pit from

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.150
ships that's just as exciting if that's

01:12:31.150 --> 01:12:33.710
the case I mean it's just as just as

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:36.170
meaningful and what date your best

01:12:36.170 --> 01:12:41.770
bracket son date about 1800 a metal

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:46.120
bracket from a ship dating to us early

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:49.580
as 1650 and found in the money pit could

01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:51.190
the Oak Island team have finally

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:53.590
discovered solid evidence that the

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:55.400
various legends about a mysterious

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:57.750
treasure being buried on Oak Island are

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:00.210
true

01:13:00.210 --> 01:13:01.630
without much more information that's

01:13:01.630 --> 01:13:05.880
where we are whether it's from again

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:09.963
that idea of the pirates of the

01:13:09.963 --> 01:13:10.963
privateers or the British military I

01:13:10.963 --> 01:13:11.963
think we have to do more testing yeah

01:13:11.963 --> 01:13:13.560
all we can say dr. Laurie is again our

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.460
heartfelt thank you for for contributing

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:24.990
appreciate it have a great day you too

01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:28.400
well that's an eye opener you know what

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:31.310
it is it's another typical Island you

01:13:31.310 --> 01:13:33.699
know as far as the medals that are

01:13:33.699 --> 01:13:35.710
concerned I think we need to further

01:13:35.710 --> 01:13:37.480
testing I think these medals needing

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:41.280
undergo a real metallurgical analysis I

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:44.460
couldn't agree more dr. Lori's analysis

01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:47.240
is dead-on dead-on stand on she's she

01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.230
explains why what she's referring to

01:13:51.230 --> 01:13:54.220
what her controls are she dates it

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:56.730
within a window that makes sense so I

01:13:56.730 --> 01:13:58.930
think wow that's that's impressive

01:13:58.930 --> 01:14:02.180
so again sit back calmly and objectively

01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:07.790
and review the data ok well season is

01:14:07.790 --> 01:14:09.900
coming to an end now we have to figure

01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:19.460
out what we do

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.770
season is coming to an end

01:14:20.770 --> 01:14:22.690
winter is closing in and I think it's

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:25.980
time sure you agree right absolutely

01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:28.290
side I guess two things what we

01:14:28.290 --> 01:14:32.460
accomplished and where we go from there

01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.750
you had distinct goals at the beginning

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:36.210
of this year I remember even voiced them

01:14:36.210 --> 01:14:39.640
many times it's not about I it's about

01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.020
we yeah so we had goals basically three

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.520
things well we were gonna prove that

01:14:45.520 --> 01:14:47.390
there's something in the swamp try to

01:14:47.390 --> 01:14:50.020
prove that Smith's Cove was real and

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.810
then we do a very large scale they get a

01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:55.750
real date for real dig into the money

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:56.750
pit

01:14:56.750 --> 01:15:00.370
okay well when you start put an X

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:02.150
through the swamp not yet

01:15:02.150 --> 01:15:06.270
no to me that has to be explored further

01:15:06.270 --> 01:15:07.980
I'm not too keen on the swamp I mean I

01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:09.170
in it I know it's getting to be a big

01:15:09.170 --> 01:15:11.690
joke because of my bias against working

01:15:11.690 --> 01:15:14.190
and stinky sloppy nasty mud look we

01:15:14.190 --> 01:15:16.630
found the spike we found the coin we

01:15:16.630 --> 01:15:19.370
found the board from a ship I just think

01:15:19.370 --> 01:15:21.100
there's there's things yet to be

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:23.400
discovered in the swamp into that and I

01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.520
think it remains a viable opportunity if

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.400
you will we're gonna go drain the swamp

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.090
again next year yes no matter what we're

01:15:30.090 --> 01:15:31.910
gonna dig in the swamp you still think

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:34.020
there's something in there I absolutely

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:40.000
believe something like

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.630
it's gonna sound corny but the best

01:15:41.630 --> 01:15:43.230
place to hide something is in plain

01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:44.230
sight

01:15:44.230 --> 01:15:48.030
it's a simple brick there's nothing

01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:51.500
simple on Oak Island you should realize

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.820
that by now the swamp I'm with Greg it's

01:15:54.820 --> 01:15:57.540
not done no no okay

01:15:57.540 --> 01:15:59.650
I guess we can move on all right Smith's

01:15:59.650 --> 01:16:03.090
Cove Smith's Cove did do us good cuz we

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:06.210
found the same manmade strata that other

01:16:06.210 --> 01:16:07.940
searchers have recorded when they were

01:16:07.940 --> 01:16:10.210
digging up the whole box drain system

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:20.250
the actual flood tunnels going down just

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.780
a few weeks ago

01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:23.240
while looking for evidence of the

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.270
original flood tunnel system at Smith's

01:16:25.270 --> 01:16:28.540
Cove the team uncovered three layers of

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.131
rounded stones it is interesting the

01:16:31.131 --> 01:16:32.980
gradation right you know you got the

01:16:32.980 --> 01:16:34.670
smallest rocks at the bottom then bigger

01:16:34.670 --> 01:16:36.420
than big great ones that seemed to be

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.630
holding it all in place I think humans

01:16:38.630 --> 01:16:41.040
built that for what end for what purpose

01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:42.040
I don't know

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:44.830
the stones were later determined to be

01:16:44.830 --> 01:16:47.330
part of an elaborate man-made irrigation

01:16:47.330 --> 01:16:51.020
system known as a French drain wear a

01:16:51.020 --> 01:16:52.970
trench would be dug and then filled with

01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:55.510
layers of stones in an effort to channel

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:58.600
water to a specific location well I

01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.450
think that was obvious those rocks were

01:17:00.450 --> 01:17:03.000
put there by man I think we found enough

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.630
structure out there to indicate that the

01:17:04.630 --> 01:17:06.690
Smith's Cove is real that it is some way

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:09.630
to artificially introduced seawater

01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:11.360
inland all right well let's let's go on

01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:15.270
to the money pit then I think we did

01:17:15.270 --> 01:17:18.230
what we set out to do in the money pit

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:22.860
we did dig that we did it not once not

01:17:22.860 --> 01:17:26.190
twice not three times like four times

01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:28.270
look I think there is something in the

01:17:28.270 --> 01:17:31.820
money good do you yes I think there's

01:17:31.820 --> 01:17:33.500
concrete information down there that

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.840
said the man was down there that wasn't

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:39.050
a searcher Amen I believe that there was

01:17:39.050 --> 01:17:42.070
a hell of a lot of work Gunnar

01:17:42.070 --> 01:17:44.250
I think we have the that sufficient

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:47.340
proof to substantiate that I believe

01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:49.440
they even going all the way back to

01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.550
although I couldn't work with him with

01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:54.650
Fred Nolan's so-called crops there I

01:17:54.650 --> 01:17:57.010
believe there's some relevance to it

01:17:57.010 --> 01:18:00.060
probably based on everything else yeah

01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:04.000
I have a question for you told me in 65

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:06.730
when you read the article you said

01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:08.880
there's treasure on Oak Island and I'm

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:11.190
going to be instrumental in finding it

01:18:11.190 --> 01:18:14.520
are you still of that mindset I don't go

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:17.400
back on what I said I know I remember

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.900
what I said I don't go back on it

01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:22.980
some people called me a damn fool yeah

01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:28.500
nobody in this group ever did one of the

01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:29.770
things is I sit here and listen to this

01:18:29.770 --> 01:18:32.340
whole deal we're going through is that I

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.620
think this I think we did a damn fine

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:36.840
job this year I really do

01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:38.860
we dug those holes in the money pit that

01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:40.900
was a technological challenge we got

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:43.360
down we excavated we did it we pulled it

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:45.920
off the question is though is it prudent

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:48.210
to continue well excuse me for

01:18:48.210 --> 01:18:51.650
interrupting I respectfully suggest you

01:18:51.650 --> 01:18:53.940
take most of the winter to find out

01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.210
because the conclusion you come to is

01:18:56.210 --> 01:18:59.000
going to be a major conclusion you know

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:02.170
that's probably Sejal effort into it

01:19:02.170 --> 01:19:04.110
there's no question about yeah we did I

01:19:04.110 --> 01:19:07.000
would want to fish in time to analyze

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.940
the pros and cons and then come to

01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:11.920
logical conclusion to whether you should

01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:15.920
continue and if so where I think that's

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.500
what you call wisdom right there

01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.460
I've seen farther because I've stood on

01:19:20.460 --> 01:19:22.900
the shoulders of giants right I can't

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:25.800
argue with a single thing he voiced well

01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.320
I agree completely with Dan's statement

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.050
I mean there's a lot of data we just

01:19:30.050 --> 01:19:32.040
haven't had time to look at it all and

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.450
to process at all and then to take the

01:19:34.450 --> 01:19:37.170
emotions out of it I've never been able

01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:38.500
to look at Oak Island except from an

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:41.020
emotional standpoint so if I were you

01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:45.360
guys I wouldn't but that's me I think

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:46.690
there's something here I can't tell you

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:48.860
why I know it's here but I believe it's

01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.920
here and I believe it's quite

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:51.920
substantial

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.100
now I said in the money Federer's that

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:56.860
somewhere else I don't know but you just

01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:01.150
haven't found the right spot

01:20:01.150 --> 01:20:03.340
and if you've done a thousand holes here

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:05.500
that we still say we didn't find the

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.900
right spot but that's strictly from an

01:20:07.900 --> 01:20:10.640
emotional standpoint I'm with Charles

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.730
I'm I'm in his bandwagon

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:16.540
I would I would love to keep going I

01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:18.430
think there's so much unfinished

01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:23.260
business let me give you that back right

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:25.670
absolutely yeah yes yep

01:20:25.670 --> 01:20:27.880
look here's what I just heard we're on

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.321
this table I heard that we should

01:20:30.321 --> 01:20:35.280
declare victory for this season who we

01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:38.630
should adjourn for this season and

01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:39.790
contemplate what comes next

01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:50.540
all in favor say aye motion carries with

01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:53.020
another harsh Nova Scotia winter just

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:55.770
weeks away and having stretched this

01:20:55.770 --> 01:20:58.500
year's financial resources to the limit

01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.130
take care have a good trip Ollie buddy

01:21:00.130 --> 01:21:03.770
come on Rick Marty and the Oak Island

01:21:03.770 --> 01:21:06.230
team have made the difficult but

01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:09.040
understandable decision to suspend their

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.310
search operations until next summer

01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:19.130
nevertheless they will leave confident

01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:21.520
that this year's search was by far their

01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:24.380
most productive take care partner thank

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.370
you to the Oak Island family is now much

01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:31.140
larger than it was prior to us arriving

01:21:31.140 --> 01:21:33.600
it's been nearly a decade

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:38.230
we still are on this quest together in

01:21:38.230 --> 01:21:40.440
addition to the mysterious metal objects

01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:44.700
they retrieved from gaol one they made

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:46.460
several more equally important

01:21:46.460 --> 01:21:49.420
discoveries you see the features that's

01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:53.910
a King George 1700s that changes a lot

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.920
this is a treasure room this dream for

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:58.370
in the general area of the suppose it

01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:00.910
hatch they heard several compelling new

01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:03.450
theories holy smokes

01:22:03.450 --> 01:22:06.310
FDR thought they were the lost jewels of

01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:09.560
Marie Antoinette and have come with

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.810
impossible inches of finding the elusive

01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:14.900
money pit these Timbers have played

01:22:14.900 --> 01:22:17.560
these part of the original date Rick and

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:20.480
I chased this dream pretty hard and

01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.320
something we've done together now how

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.540
many boys get to enact their childhood

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:28.540
dream searching for pirate treasure

01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.150
when you look at it in summation the

01:22:31.150 --> 01:22:33.561
efforts and the passions and the belief

01:22:33.561 --> 01:22:35.830
and the angst and round it all along

01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:38.880
we've been good stewards of a great

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.380
mystery and it's not a singular pursuit

01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:45.500
it's all of us together they Oak Island

01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:52.040
family

01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:56.840
for now the island secrets remain hidden

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.290
safely protected under dozens of feet of

01:22:59.290 --> 01:23:00.580
rocks and clay

01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:08.690
but it is only a matter of time before

01:23:08.690 --> 01:23:12.590
whatever is buried will be exposed and

01:23:12.590 --> 01:23:15.360
the truth about Oak Island and its curse

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:22.580
will finally be revealed

01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:29.590
next week the Oak Island team travels to

01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:32.400
Michigan along with host Matty Blake to

01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.590
share an exclusive look at what lies

01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:37.570
ahead in the math there's a cipher and

01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:39.440
that's what the cipher says Wow

01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.570
join them as they reveal the latest

01:23:41.570 --> 01:23:44.560
information we add carbon testing and

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:46.950
expose some shocking new discoveries

01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:50.110
system research puts X on the spot

01:23:50.110 --> 01:23:52.360
this is it don't miss the exciting

01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:55.380
season four wrap up the curse of Oak

01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.440
Island drilling down
