00:06.615 --> 00:09.531
MURPHY:
Jenny's mom said
she had a friend.

00:09.574 --> 00:11.098
What was it?

00:12.142 --> 00:13.883
Savannah?

00:15.711 --> 00:17.713
Savannah?JESS:Oh, boy.

00:18.757 --> 00:21.021
[sighs] Definitely
not Savannah.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.849
I actually find
it hilarious

00:23.893 --> 00:27.679
that you're not excited
to see me at all anymore.

00:27.723 --> 00:29.420
Susan?I mean, a day ago,
you were begging for me.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.466
Susan Josephs?To be quite
honest, Murphy,

00:31.509 --> 00:34.338
you should be thrilled

00:34.382 --> 00:35.905
that I'm even talking to you
right now,

00:35.948 --> 00:39.213
because... no one else is, kid.

00:39.256 --> 00:40.953
[bag rustling]

00:40.997 --> 00:43.956
I still can't
believe that Max

00:44.000 --> 00:48.091
convinced Felix
to smuggle your body

00:48.135 --> 00:51.225
across the border
just so he could...

00:51.268 --> 00:53.879
bone Lesley in peace.

00:53.923 --> 00:56.056
[chuckles]

00:56.099 --> 00:59.189
And then Felix left you
in the middle of nowhere.

00:59.233 --> 01:01.626
By the way, have you
heard from Trey?

01:01.670 --> 01:04.107
Oh, that's right.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.674
He said he would call you

01:05.717 --> 01:08.024
when he got
his phone,

01:08.068 --> 01:10.287
but he never
did. Ugh.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.289
The hits just
keep comin'.

01:12.333 --> 01:13.986
Look, I have bigger problems
right now.

01:14.030 --> 01:15.292
Sorry, but what
do you think

01:15.336 --> 01:16.902
this friend is
gonna lead you to?

01:16.946 --> 01:19.122
She's gonna help me find
Jenny's brother.

01:19.166 --> 01:21.168
You're never gonna
figure it out.S...

01:21.211 --> 01:22.473
S... Susannah.

01:22.517 --> 01:25.824
Ingrid. [sighs]Shut up. Susannah, uh...

01:25.868 --> 01:27.826
Beth.Susannah Jenkins.

01:27.870 --> 01:29.828
Thank God.
[sniffles]

01:29.872 --> 01:31.656
That was it. Susannah Jenkins.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.658
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Five percent battery.

01:33.702 --> 01:34.790
Have a good one.

01:34.833 --> 01:37.140
Thank you!

01:37.184 --> 01:38.533
Sir!

01:38.576 --> 01:39.969
What a nice man.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.014
You should
learn from him.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.496
Oh, my God, this is
what rock bottom is like.

01:45.540 --> 01:48.586
[sniffles]We're in rock
bottom right now.

01:48.630 --> 01:50.022
All your friends
abandoned you,

01:50.066 --> 01:52.764
and everybody thinks
you're homeless!

01:52.808 --> 01:55.419
Okay, technically,
I abandoned Felix.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.380
Look up
"Susannah Jenkins."

01:59.423 --> 02:01.033
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Call from Gordon Howard.

02:01.077 --> 02:03.558
Felix. Stop.
Go away.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.864
[sighs]

02:05.908 --> 02:07.649
Look up "Susannah Jenkins."

02:07.692 --> 02:10.347
Look up "Susannah Jenkins
friend missing."

02:10.391 --> 02:12.349
Look up
"Jennifer Walker missing."

02:12.393 --> 02:14.134
"Susan Jenkins."

02:14.177 --> 02:15.483
Look up "Bonnie Walker."

02:15.526 --> 02:16.745
Oh, God.

02:16.788 --> 02:19.313
"Jennifer Walker
missing persons case."

02:19.356 --> 02:22.490
Look up "Susannah Jenkins
Jennifer Walker."

02:22.533 --> 02:25.667
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Result for "Susannah Jenkins
Jennifer Walker"

02:25.710 --> 02:28.191
in the Chicago Tribune.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.889
"Susannah Jenkins, who now
resides in South Bend..."

02:30.933 --> 02:33.631
Look up "Susannah Jenkins
South Bend."

02:33.675 --> 02:36.025
Well, I'm gonna
leave you to it.

02:36.068 --> 02:39.855
White pages results for
"Susannah Jenkins South Bend."

02:39.898 --> 02:41.900
[engine rumbling]

02:49.212 --> 02:50.909
South Bend, right?

02:50.953 --> 02:52.346
That's right.

02:53.651 --> 02:55.653
[brakes hiss]

02:59.309 --> 03:01.398
â™ª

03:13.715 --> 03:16.196
I would say it's weird for
a guy to basically move in

03:16.239 --> 03:18.198
after a few days.

03:18.241 --> 03:20.678
But I'll just look at you more
as, like, my live-in chef.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.419
So as soon
as I stop cooking, then it's...

03:22.463 --> 03:24.421
Oh, it's over.
You're homeless.[chuckles]

03:26.771 --> 03:27.990
Felix, what
the hell?

03:28.033 --> 03:28.991
Where's Murphy?

03:29.034 --> 03:31.298
I don't-- I have no idea.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.691
We got into a huge fight,
and I left her.

03:33.735 --> 03:34.910
Where?

03:34.953 --> 03:36.128
In a parking lot.

03:36.172 --> 03:37.260
After I calmed
down a bit,

03:37.304 --> 03:38.914
I went back to try to find her,

03:38.957 --> 03:39.915
and she wasn't there.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.046
Did you try calling her?

03:41.090 --> 03:42.265
No, Max,
I haven't tried calling her.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.093
That's a very
interesting idea.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.181
Maybe I should give that one
a go.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.269
LESLEY:
So that's it?

03:46.313 --> 03:47.270
You're not even
gonna go look for her?

03:47.314 --> 03:48.358
FELIX:
I mean, even if I do

03:48.402 --> 03:49.968
find her, what am I gonna do,

03:50.012 --> 03:51.579
throw her in my trunk again?

03:51.622 --> 03:52.884
'Cause that went really well.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.146
I know it sounds
like I'm giving up,

03:54.190 --> 03:56.279
but I actually think
the best use of my time

03:56.323 --> 03:57.715
is to start building our defense

03:57.759 --> 03:59.804
for when she inevitably
gets caught.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.153
LESLEY:
Ah.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.765
That's why you came back.

04:03.808 --> 04:06.202
I also need a place to stay.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.377
[chuckles]Cool.

04:07.421 --> 04:08.726
Well, unlike
you people,

04:08.770 --> 04:10.946
I actually have
a job to get to.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.208
Les.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.514
Les.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.950
How else do you think
I can pay for this house

04:14.993 --> 04:16.299
you've all decided to live in?

04:16.343 --> 04:17.431
Okay, so Max

04:17.474 --> 04:18.997
and I are just gonna spend hours

04:19.041 --> 04:20.956
researching
Illinois criminal law when we're

04:20.999 --> 04:23.480
in the presence of one
of the best public defenders

04:23.524 --> 04:25.134
in the history of the state?Is that true?

04:25.177 --> 04:26.396
FELIX:Yeah.

04:26.440 --> 04:27.963
I'll see you freeloaders later.

04:29.443 --> 04:31.662
[door opens, closes]

04:32.707 --> 04:34.491
So, what'd she do?

04:34.535 --> 04:36.101
What?Murphy.

04:36.145 --> 04:37.929
What'd she do
that pissed you off?

04:37.973 --> 04:39.148
I don't know.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.237
You know how she is.

04:45.197 --> 04:47.287
Illinois criminal offenses.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.549
Start reading.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.553
MURPHY:
Do you by any chance know

04:52.596 --> 04:54.598
where
J-Jennifer's brother is?

04:54.642 --> 04:56.383
God, Patrick. Um,

04:56.426 --> 04:59.255
last I heard, he had
checked himself into rehab.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.344
Where was the rehab place?

05:01.388 --> 05:02.780
What is it?I'm not sure.

05:02.824 --> 05:04.173
Somewhere
in Chicago?

05:04.216 --> 05:05.566
But, just so you know,
I-I really don't think

05:05.609 --> 05:08.264
he had anything to do
with what happened to Jenny.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.397
What doyou think
happened to Jenny?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.007
[inhales]

05:12.050 --> 05:14.357
Honestly, I think
it was suicide.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.839
She was troubled.

05:17.882 --> 05:20.058
Yeah, I've-I've heard that.
[clears throat]

05:20.102 --> 05:22.626
I get what
you're doing.

05:22.670 --> 05:24.628
After Jenny went
missing, I spent...

05:24.672 --> 05:26.848
years trying
to find her.

05:26.891 --> 05:29.024
Gives you a sense of control.

05:29.067 --> 05:31.766
It's like... so long as
you're looking for her,

05:31.809 --> 05:33.420
you can keep telling
yourself she's alive.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.509
I get that. Um...

05:36.510 --> 05:38.642
But Jess is alive.

05:39.643 --> 05:40.905
She is.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.125
Okay, I hope
that's the case.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.084
But, um...

05:46.128 --> 05:47.999
I can't help you.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.479
There's no one
hunting Jenny down.

05:49.523 --> 05:52.003
At-at least that I know of.

05:54.005 --> 05:55.572
Thanks. I'll, uh,
get out of your hair.

05:58.923 --> 06:00.490
Do you have a, um...

06:00.534 --> 06:03.711
a charger for this?

06:03.754 --> 06:05.321
This phone.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.802
Um...

06:08.846 --> 06:11.327
Uh, no. Sorry.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.547
Um, I can call someone for you
though.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.115
I don't really have, uh,
a lot of numbers memorized.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.856
I'll-I'll figure it out.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.380
[baby fussing]

06:20.423 --> 06:22.033
[chuckles]:
Oh.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.557
Ooh.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.775
[baby crying]

06:24.819 --> 06:26.821
[shushing softly]

06:29.432 --> 06:30.564
Hi.

06:30.607 --> 06:31.739
Hello.

06:31.782 --> 06:33.436
Ooh, someone'shungry.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.003
Are you
getting hungry?

06:35.046 --> 06:36.744
Actually,
can you call someone for me?

06:38.528 --> 06:40.530
I know the number.

06:45.579 --> 06:46.754
Mrs. Walker.

06:46.797 --> 06:49.234
I'm Gene Clemens.
We're with Chicago P.D.

06:49.278 --> 06:50.975
Is this about Jenny?Sort of.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.848
Uh, there was a girl who
came here asking about her?Mm-hmm.

06:53.891 --> 06:55.676
Okay, her name
is Murphy Mason.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.286
She's a criminal,
and we're trying to figure out

06:57.329 --> 06:58.461
where she may have gone
from here.

06:58.505 --> 07:00.463
So this has nothing to do
with my daughter?

07:00.507 --> 07:02.117
SARAH:
I know this
is difficult,

07:02.160 --> 07:03.858
and I'm-- we're
sorry that we...Did you give her

07:03.901 --> 07:06.034
any information?

07:07.601 --> 07:09.646
If you don't know anything
about my daughter's whereabouts,

07:09.690 --> 07:10.821
I would like for you to leave.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.910
Can you just tell us
what you told Murphy?

07:12.954 --> 07:14.477
She told me

07:14.521 --> 07:16.436
that Jenny was so scared
of somebody

07:16.479 --> 07:18.394
that she sold
her own identity.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.310
So maybe go find that person
and see where they're keeping

07:21.353 --> 07:22.833
my baby.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.487
Just find my daughter.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.358
Okay. Thanks, ma'am.

07:26.402 --> 07:27.621
We'll do our best. Thank you

07:27.664 --> 07:29.318
for your time.

07:32.800 --> 07:34.454
All right.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.850
[crunching]

07:43.245 --> 07:44.725
Uh...

07:44.768 --> 07:46.640
can I have some--
can I have some of that?

07:46.683 --> 07:48.511
I'm starving.[chuckles softly]

07:48.555 --> 07:51.514
It's a, um...
lactation cookie.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.907
I don't think
you want them.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.604
Okay.

07:58.042 --> 08:00.523
[tires screech]

08:00.567 --> 08:01.916
[car door shuts]

08:01.959 --> 08:04.484
I think that's
your ride.

08:05.615 --> 08:07.965
[exhales]

08:10.620 --> 08:13.014
Murphy?

08:13.057 --> 08:14.798
Murphy, come outside right now!

08:20.456 --> 08:21.762
[leaves rattling]

08:24.895 --> 08:26.897
Thank God.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.298
Hi, Mom.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.778
You in
one piece?[sniffles]

08:37.821 --> 08:39.388
You okay?

08:39.431 --> 08:40.824
Yeah?

08:40.868 --> 08:42.870
[sniffles]It's okay.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.133
In the car. Come
on. In the car.

08:46.177 --> 08:48.049
Step down. Step down.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.051
Let's get you home.

08:54.229 --> 08:58.015
We need to know where did Murphy
go from the mom's house.

08:58.059 --> 09:00.104
You keep asking me
that question like I have

09:00.148 --> 09:02.716
the answer.Hey, idiots. We could just solve
this missing person case.

09:02.759 --> 09:03.934
It might lead us to Murphy

09:03.978 --> 09:06.589
and give this poor mother
some closure.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.025
It's not about solving the case.

09:08.069 --> 09:09.461
It's about solving it
through Murphy's eyes,

09:09.505 --> 09:10.941
figuring out
where she might go next.

09:10.985 --> 09:13.422
Yeah, well, if you bothered
to do an ounce of research,

09:13.465 --> 09:14.728
you would know that Redford Long

09:14.771 --> 09:17.252
was arrested for kidnapping
Jennifer Walker.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.689
If I'm Murphy Mason,
that's where I'm going next.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.691
[chuckles softly]

09:25.129 --> 09:27.523
GPS:
Vehicle stopped
on shoulder ahead.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.178
Thanks for driving me back
to Chicago.Mm-hmm.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.006
[song playing quietly on radio]

09:32.049 --> 09:33.834
Slowdown reported ahead.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.749
Turn that dumb thing off, Mom.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.359
I need it.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.403
You don't need it.

09:38.447 --> 09:40.144
I do, actually.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.406
I've gotten in a
couple of accidents

09:41.450 --> 09:43.887
because I haven't
been sleeping.

09:43.931 --> 09:46.629
Promised Dad I'd
always have it on, so...

09:48.718 --> 09:50.546
Slowdown reported ahead.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
Now, are you gonna tell me
where you've really been?

09:53.636 --> 09:55.116
I already told you, Mom.

09:55.159 --> 09:56.944
I was hiking
the Appalachian Trail.

09:56.987 --> 09:58.772
First of all,

09:58.815 --> 10:00.774
I haven't seen you so much
as hike up a driveway.

10:00.817 --> 10:02.297
Second of all, the
Appalachian Trail

10:02.340 --> 10:04.560
runs from Georgia to Maine,
but yet somehow you ended up

10:04.604 --> 10:06.040
in South Bend.
Try again.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.694
Slowdown reported ahead.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.653
Oh, my God. I got separated
from the group. And it--

10:10.697 --> 10:12.699
Mom, it's a long story.
I don't--

10:12.742 --> 10:14.831
I'm not doing this right now.
I...

10:14.875 --> 10:16.833
I just need to get home.What home?

10:16.877 --> 10:18.443
[sighs]I went to your apartment.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.489
Someone else is living there.

10:21.969 --> 10:23.405
Now, I'm gonna give you
one more chance

10:23.448 --> 10:25.059
to tell me
what the hell is going on.

10:25.102 --> 10:26.538
There's nothing going on!

10:26.582 --> 10:28.236
Then why are cops
showing up at my door,

10:28.279 --> 10:30.107
telling me you're
involved in a murder case?

10:30.151 --> 10:32.153
So cut the crap!

10:35.330 --> 10:37.680
I don't know.
That I don't know about. I...

10:37.724 --> 10:40.683
I don't know what that is, Mom.
I swear.

10:40.727 --> 10:43.033
Okay, Murphy.

10:43.077 --> 10:45.601
You're lying to me, and
I'm not driving another inch

10:45.645 --> 10:47.124
until you tell me
what's going on.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.300
What are you doing?

10:49.344 --> 10:50.562
Are you...?

10:51.999 --> 10:53.565
MURPHY:
You're actually insane.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.742
What are you doing?
I don't have time for this.

10:55.785 --> 10:57.700
JOY [laughing]:
Oh, 'cause
your schedule's so busy?

10:57.744 --> 11:02.009
Just drive!No. Not until you tell me
what's really going on!

11:02.052 --> 11:05.708
[phone buzzing]

11:05.752 --> 11:07.449
Hey.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.931
SARAH:
Hey, look, I got your texts
and everything. I...

11:10.974 --> 11:12.541
I can't do this.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.804
Come on. Sarah,
I said I was sorry.

11:14.848 --> 11:18.068
I'd get fired if anyone found
out what happened, and I...

11:18.112 --> 11:19.853
Okay, but who am I gonna tell?

11:19.896 --> 11:23.726
Darnell, I like you--
I think that's pretty clear--

11:23.770 --> 11:25.859
but we both know
that this is a bad idea.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.732
I just... I can't do this.

11:32.213 --> 11:34.128
Well...

11:34.171 --> 11:36.347
I guess you know where to find
me if you change your mind?

11:36.391 --> 11:38.915
Yeah. I'll see you.

11:45.182 --> 11:47.271
Oh.

11:49.621 --> 11:53.103
Want some food?
I got enough for you.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.539
How could I eat,

11:54.583 --> 11:56.150
knowing the cops think
I killed three people?

11:56.193 --> 11:57.891
[scoffs]

11:57.934 --> 12:01.938
I told you, Cindy could hook you
up with a whole new identity.

12:01.982 --> 12:04.593
Yeah? Then what?

12:04.636 --> 12:07.291
Start over.
Do whatever you want.

12:07.335 --> 12:09.206
But I didn't just
ruin things with Sarah

12:09.250 --> 12:11.818
so you could sit on my couch
playing video games forever.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.907
Ruin things?

12:13.950 --> 12:16.213
You only slept with her once.

12:16.257 --> 12:18.259
Yeah.

12:20.391 --> 12:22.611
Fine. Whatever.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.353
I'll go see Cindy
after I beat this level.

12:30.532 --> 12:33.187
Mm...
Anything?

12:33.230 --> 12:36.538
I understand about every fifth
word in this book, so... no.

12:36.581 --> 12:38.279
[exhales]

12:40.890 --> 12:42.805
Okay, why didn't you guys just
call the cops

12:42.849 --> 12:45.025
and claim self-defense?FELIX:Well,

12:45.068 --> 12:47.201
look who came crawling back.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.769
No, I just... I couldn't
pay attention in this meeting

12:49.812 --> 12:52.989
because your stupidity was
bothering me, and so, just...

12:53.033 --> 12:54.861
Why didn't you claim
self-defense?

12:54.904 --> 12:57.646
Because they were trafficking
heroin at the time, that's why.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.213
Okay, but I thought you were
forced into the heroin thing.

12:59.256 --> 13:00.649
FELIX:
Did you really

13:00.692 --> 13:03.043
leave work early just
to come ridicule the way

13:03.086 --> 13:04.914
I handled the situation?I just don't want

13:04.958 --> 13:07.308
to see you go to prison
for the rest of your life.

13:07.351 --> 13:10.311
But, honestly,
self-defense was

13:10.354 --> 13:12.269
my one swing, and so,
unless you have an eyewitness

13:12.313 --> 13:14.054
or someone
to corroborate that story,

13:14.097 --> 13:16.186
I have to pivot
and think of something else.

13:16.230 --> 13:19.624
Wait. There is actually somebody
who could corroborate, but,

13:19.668 --> 13:21.670
uh,

13:21.713 --> 13:23.628
they're gonna take
some convincing.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.674
[door buzzes, latch clicks]

13:30.070 --> 13:32.072
[door closes]

13:33.073 --> 13:35.162
Who are you?

13:36.554 --> 13:39.035
Lesley Bell, your new attorney.

13:44.127 --> 13:45.433
Look, I don't have any money.

13:45.476 --> 13:47.914
I'm doing this pro bono.Why?

13:47.957 --> 13:49.872
I've reviewed your case, Sam.

13:49.916 --> 13:51.613
I can't promise
you won't do any time,

13:51.656 --> 13:53.833
but I know I can get a lot
of these charges thrown out.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.488
Like the murder of...
Vincent Davis?

13:57.532 --> 14:00.230
All they have is
your fingerprints in his car.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.015
On the passenger side.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.668
Have you ever ridden
in that seat,

14:03.712 --> 14:05.540
in the last-- I don't
know-- five years?

14:05.583 --> 14:06.933
Nope.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.673
Well, let's say you had.

14:08.717 --> 14:11.328
That would explain
the fingerprint.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.591
Okay.

14:13.635 --> 14:14.984
Here's my overall strategy
for the stuff

14:15.028 --> 14:17.073
I can't get thrown out.

14:17.117 --> 14:19.467
You started in the business
when you were too young

14:19.510 --> 14:21.469
to think for yourself.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.472
Your main shot at survival
was doing what you were told,

14:24.515 --> 14:26.430
which mainly consisted
of threatening people

14:26.474 --> 14:28.693
into working for
Nia Bailey, right?

14:28.737 --> 14:30.739
So this isn't free.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.263
Like I said,
I'm doing this pro bono.

14:33.307 --> 14:35.048
Lesley Bell, right?

14:35.091 --> 14:38.007
You're related to Felix.
Let me guess.

14:38.051 --> 14:41.315
You want me to testify
that I coerced them into this?

14:41.358 --> 14:43.012
What happened?

14:43.056 --> 14:44.796
They get caught?

14:44.840 --> 14:47.669
Murphy... might,

14:47.712 --> 14:50.193
yes, and I'm
worried if she does,

14:50.237 --> 14:52.543
my brother's gonna go down, too.

14:52.587 --> 14:55.720
Sam, you need good
representation.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.418
Loyalty isn't gonna get you
anything anymore.

14:59.637 --> 15:01.639
You never
had a chance.

15:01.683 --> 15:04.468
Give yourself one.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.862
[sighs]

15:08.646 --> 15:11.693
I'll think about it, okay?

15:11.736 --> 15:13.913
I'll leave my number
with your CO.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.701
[door buzzes]

15:21.529 --> 15:24.880
Mom, can we... can we please
just get back in the car?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.534
This is so stupid.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.275
I need to go back to
Chicago. I-I got to...

15:28.318 --> 15:29.711
I got to go.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.931
Jess and Felix--
they're worried about me.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.584
You know what's funny?

15:33.628 --> 15:35.412
You still think
you can lie to me.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.848
No, I'm not lying.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.459
Please.No.

15:38.502 --> 15:40.330
You've been lying
since you could talk.

15:40.374 --> 15:43.072
Every time you said
you were doing your homework

15:43.116 --> 15:45.379
when you were actually
smoking pot in your room.

15:45.422 --> 15:47.859
Every time you said
you were staying at Jess's

15:47.903 --> 15:50.210
when you were actually sneaking
into Jared Johnson's bedroom?

15:50.253 --> 15:52.212
Okay.I know every lie you have

15:52.255 --> 15:54.214
ever told me, Murphy.You know what's
even funnier, Mom?

15:54.257 --> 15:56.912
You think
you know everything about me.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.132
Well, I clearly don't know
everything.No, you don't.

15:59.175 --> 16:01.569
That's okay! Just stop...

16:01.612 --> 16:04.006
Stop trying to control
my every move!

16:04.050 --> 16:06.182
Control your every move?

16:06.226 --> 16:08.271
Come on!
You come on!

16:08.315 --> 16:11.666
You try to keep me
in this little box.

16:11.709 --> 16:14.625
You picked my job,
and you picked my apartment,

16:14.669 --> 16:16.410
you homeschooled me...

16:16.453 --> 16:19.413
Oh, I am so sorry for wanting
to protect you, Murphy!

16:19.456 --> 16:20.980
Well, look around, Mom.
Look around.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.372
It did the opposite.

16:22.416 --> 16:24.244
Oh, here it comes.
All my fault.

16:24.287 --> 16:26.942
You know what? I will
find another ride.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.813
Oh, really? How?Believe it
or not, Mom,

16:28.857 --> 16:30.946
I am capable
of doing things without you.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.992
[scoffs]I am.

16:34.689 --> 16:36.517
[yelling]:
Help! Someone help me!

16:36.560 --> 16:38.171
Please!JOY:Murphy,

16:38.214 --> 16:39.737
what are you doing?I need help!

16:39.781 --> 16:42.566
Ma'am?Help!
Oh, God.

16:42.610 --> 16:44.177
Is everything okay?No, I-I'm...

16:44.220 --> 16:46.266
I'm blind, and I'm lost,

16:46.309 --> 16:48.050
and this woman is harassing me.

16:48.094 --> 16:49.443
I just need a ride out of here.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.922
Where are you headed?I am going

16:50.966 --> 16:52.272
to Chicago.No! No, you are not
getting into a car

16:52.315 --> 16:53.969
with a stranger.Ma'am, ma'am.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.405
Lower your voice.I am her mother.

16:55.449 --> 16:58.843
Lower your voice
and get away from me.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.149
Is this really your mom?

17:00.193 --> 17:02.151
No! No.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.892
I don't even know her.
I've never even met her

17:03.935 --> 17:05.720
in my life.Check her jacket pocket.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.331
You will find ChapStick
and potato chip crumbs.

17:10.507 --> 17:12.466
Okay, maybe she
is my mother,

17:12.509 --> 17:14.294
but that doesn't mean
she isn't harassing me.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.730
Please give me a ride.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.514
Be nicer to your mom.JOY:
Thank you.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.690
You are impossible.Don't, don't, don't.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.692
You are im...[sniffles]

17:21.736 --> 17:23.433
I don't have time
for this, Mom.

17:23.477 --> 17:26.480
If you're not gonna
drive me, just... just go.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.482
I'm not going anywhere.

17:28.525 --> 17:30.397
Fine. I'll go, and I'll
go find another ride,

17:30.440 --> 17:31.876
and you just stay
here forever.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.269
No. No. You don't move
a muscle, Murphy Mason.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.358
Mom, don't you get it?

17:37.360 --> 17:40.015
You can't tell me
what to do anymore.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.760
Forward, Pretzel.

17:45.803 --> 17:49.242
Just wait!
Just... wait.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.114
What?

17:52.158 --> 17:54.725
Just let me buy you lunch
before you go.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.339
I can tell
you've barely eaten in days.

18:05.562 --> 18:06.998
LESLEY:
I don't know what to tell you.

18:07.042 --> 18:08.783
Sam says she needs time,

18:08.826 --> 18:10.785
but I really think
she'll come around.

18:10.828 --> 18:12.395
We don't have time.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.267
That's not actually true.
We don't even know

18:14.310 --> 18:15.833
when Murphy's gonna
get arrested,

18:15.877 --> 18:17.531
and after she does, she
still has to wait for trial.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.141
And in said trial,

18:19.185 --> 18:21.274
we need Sam's help,
which you didn't get.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.102
I said I think
she'll come around.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.321
Just wait. I'm telling you.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.931
I'm going
back to work.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.936
Let me know the moment
you hear from her, please.Mm-hmm.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.509
It's 8,000 bucks
and an extra $50 for the phone.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.163
You'll pay Jason
at Lefty's Lodge,

18:41.207 --> 18:42.556
who'll give you
your passport.

18:42.599 --> 18:45.080
Got it. Thank you.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.647
Hey, could you tell me

18:46.690 --> 18:48.344
about a girl that
got an ID from you,

18:48.388 --> 18:50.085
like, ten years ago?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.348
Jennifer Walker.

18:54.524 --> 18:57.745
I'll give you, like,
an extra 500 bucks.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.751
Walker, you said?

19:03.794 --> 19:05.796
Yeah.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
Oh. I never actually met her.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.196
Someone sold me her identity
a few months ago.

19:14.240 --> 19:15.806
A few months ago?

19:15.850 --> 19:17.765
Who?
Her brother.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.514
Do you think you could
give me Murphy's number?

19:27.557 --> 19:29.211
It was in my old phone.Come on, man.

19:29.255 --> 19:30.734
What? Don't you think
it's kind of weird

19:30.778 --> 19:32.345
Jenny's brother
sold her identity?

19:32.388 --> 19:34.825
What I think is weird
is you not getting out of town.

19:34.869 --> 19:37.567
Just... give
me her number.

19:39.830 --> 19:42.050
[scoffs]

19:42.093 --> 19:44.705
"You just slept with the girl,
like, once."

19:46.750 --> 19:49.231
Actually, I slept with her
twice, but I see your point.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.712
What?You're an idiot.
Just get in the car.

19:52.756 --> 19:55.629
I got to say,
I have a little PTSD

19:55.672 --> 19:57.805
sitting across
from three detectives.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.242
Look, Redford,
we're just here to ask

20:00.286 --> 20:01.765
about this girl
Murphy Mason.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.419
Did she come by here?

20:03.463 --> 20:05.204
Yeah, she and a friend.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.292
She did?

20:06.335 --> 20:08.729
They were asking about Jenny.

20:08.772 --> 20:10.861
Did you tell her
anything?

20:10.905 --> 20:12.602
Just my side of the story.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.735
And do you know
where she went from here?

20:14.778 --> 20:16.258
Yeah.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.433
To Jenny's mom's house.

20:17.477 --> 20:18.695
I gave her the address.

20:24.527 --> 20:26.703
I'm gonna put in our order.

20:31.839 --> 20:34.755
[sighs] Well, this
is hard to watch.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.670
What?

20:36.713 --> 20:39.107
Your mom.

20:39.150 --> 20:40.674
She's in
a bad way.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.153
Well, she's always in a bad way.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.981
No, I know, but
not like this.

20:44.025 --> 20:46.201
I mean, she's like a shell of
her former self or something.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.986
Oh, Joy.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.598
You shouldn't have called her,
you know that.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.861
I didn't have anyone else
to call. Trust me.

20:53.904 --> 20:55.428
Oh.She was my last option.

20:55.471 --> 20:58.039
You didn't have
anybody else to call.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.171
Okay.

21:00.215 --> 21:03.479
What?Don't act like you don't know
what you're doing.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.829
I wasn't doing anything.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.398
You're terrified.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.922
That's okay.

21:11.966 --> 21:14.403
You just wanted your mommy.

21:14.447 --> 21:16.449
That's not what I was doing.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.190
Okay.

21:19.234 --> 21:21.018
Well, then, the next time

21:21.062 --> 21:23.586
you're this desperate
for comfort, can you just, like,

21:23.630 --> 21:25.327
go have sex
with somebody?

21:25.371 --> 21:28.025
Just, like, go drink
a bottle of whatever.

21:28.069 --> 21:31.072
But please, for the love of God,
leave Joy out of this.

21:31.115 --> 21:32.465
Please.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.380
JOY:
Okay.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.295
Here.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.994
Just because I didn't make it
at home doesn't mean I can't add

21:40.037 --> 21:42.170
my special ingredient.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.305
[sniffles]

21:46.348 --> 21:47.741
Eat.

21:47.784 --> 21:50.309
[sighs]

21:50.352 --> 21:53.747
You've always done that exactly
the same way since I was a kid.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.358
Your hand on my cheek like that
whenever you fed me.

21:56.402 --> 21:58.099
Old habits.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.449
â™ª

22:00.493 --> 22:02.669
I'm so sorry, Mom.

22:02.712 --> 22:04.671
[voice breaking]:
I'm so sorry.

22:04.714 --> 22:06.716
[sniffling]

22:08.588 --> 22:10.372
Oh, this wasn't fair to you.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.592
Just tell me.

22:12.635 --> 22:14.768
Tell me what's going on.

22:14.811 --> 22:17.248
You don't have to do this alone.

22:18.293 --> 22:20.469
I don't know what to do, Mom.

22:20.513 --> 22:22.689
I can help you.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.778
I don't know what to do.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.736
You can tell me anything.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.043
It's so bad.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.959
I don't even know
how I got here.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.743
[takes deep breath]

22:33.787 --> 22:35.876
You remember
my friend Tyson, right?

22:35.919 --> 22:37.878
[breathing shakily]

22:37.921 --> 22:39.662
We were forced
into selling drugs.

22:39.706 --> 22:41.490
...this woman,
she almost killed me.

22:41.534 --> 22:43.536
Oh, my God.MURPHY:
Jess shot her, but she had to.

22:43.579 --> 22:45.538
She didn't know what else to do.

22:45.581 --> 22:46.843
Jess is missing.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.671
I don't know where she is.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.851
[line rings]

22:54.895 --> 22:56.287
JOSH:
Yeah.

22:56.331 --> 22:58.420
Hi, uh, J-Josh Wallace?

22:58.464 --> 23:01.336
This is Joy Mason,
uh, Murphy's mom.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.295
I didn't know who else to call.

23:04.339 --> 23:06.646
You said
you could protect Murphy.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.476
And I think she needs it.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.875
â™ª Never to stay, never

23:18.919 --> 23:23.924
â™ª Never to tell them again

23:26.143 --> 23:27.928
â™ª I've been looking...

23:27.971 --> 23:29.320
You ready?

23:31.148 --> 23:33.107
Where are we going?

23:33.150 --> 23:35.805
Wherever you can get
that information about Jess.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.504
So I guess we'll try to see
wherever, uh...

23:38.547 --> 23:41.028
whatever rehab facility
the brother's at.

23:41.071 --> 23:42.638
[exhales]

23:42.682 --> 23:44.466
[inhales deeply]

23:44.510 --> 23:46.947
Thank you, Mom.I want to get you

23:46.990 --> 23:48.296
some cash
and some fresh clothes, too,

23:48.339 --> 23:50.646
so we'll
just swing by the house first.

23:50.690 --> 23:52.082
Okay.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.171
Thank you, Mom.Yeah.

23:54.215 --> 23:55.869
Come on, Pretzel.

23:55.912 --> 23:59.176
Find outside. Find outside.

23:59.220 --> 24:01.744
Thank you.Yeah.

24:01.788 --> 24:04.443
Find outside.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.229
JOSH:
Hang on one sec.

24:08.272 --> 24:10.797
Joy gave me the code.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.191
GENE:
All right. Well,

24:14.235 --> 24:15.236
backup's on the way.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.977
Okay, great.

24:17.020 --> 24:19.327
You guys ready?Yeah.

24:19.370 --> 24:21.416
It's what
we've been waiting for.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.026
Let's do it.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.380
How far away are we?

24:29.424 --> 24:31.948
Ten minutes or so.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.515
Okay.

24:33.559 --> 24:35.996
GPS:
Police reported ahead.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.260
GENE:
All right, listen up.

24:39.303 --> 24:41.697
They're driving
west on Plymouth.

24:41.741 --> 24:42.959
So we're gonna station
a few of you

24:43.003 --> 24:44.178
east of here, just in case.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.223
All right, let's move out.

24:48.574 --> 24:51.664
Do you care if I take
a quick shower when we get home?

24:51.707 --> 24:54.144
I feel disgusting.

24:54.188 --> 24:57.060
Course.Thank you.

24:57.104 --> 24:58.845
I won't use
your good shampoo.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.847
Police reported ahead.

25:00.890 --> 25:02.979
Let me turn this off.

25:03.023 --> 25:04.590
What's going on?

25:04.633 --> 25:06.330
Police reported ahead.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.724
Why are there so many
cops by our house?

25:08.768 --> 25:10.987
Nothing. There aren't.
It's just this-this app...

25:11.031 --> 25:12.423
Police reported ahead.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.643
...is being weird.

25:14.687 --> 25:16.471
There, it's-it's off.

25:19.518 --> 25:21.128
Did you set me up?

25:21.171 --> 25:22.825
No! I...

25:22.869 --> 25:26.133
Mom, did you set me up?No, no, I... I-I...
I would n... No!

25:26.176 --> 25:27.917
Mom.It's not...
It's not what it seems, okay?

25:27.961 --> 25:30.006
It's just... I'm just...
I'm trying to keep you safe.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.879
Oh, my God.J-Jess is gone.

25:32.922 --> 25:34.620
That can't happen to you.
Josh promised

25:34.663 --> 25:36.535
to protect you, so...Josh?!

25:36.578 --> 25:37.971
Josh?Yes.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.539
Josh doesn't want
to protect me, Mom.

25:40.582 --> 25:43.803
He wants me to rot in prison
for the rest of my life.Well,

25:43.846 --> 25:45.065
it's better than being dead.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.457
Oh, my God.
Let me out of the car.No,

25:46.501 --> 25:47.937
you are not getting out
of the car. Murphy!

25:47.981 --> 25:49.591
Let me out of the car, Mom.You are not getting out

25:49.635 --> 25:51.201
of the car!I said let me out
of the car now!

25:51.245 --> 25:52.638
You are not getting out
of the car!Let me leave the car.

25:52.681 --> 25:54.727
[Murphy and Joy scream][crash]

25:56.598 --> 25:59.601
Ow! What the hell?!Oh, my God!

25:59.645 --> 26:01.603
Mom, what did you do?!

26:01.647 --> 26:03.083
Oh, my God.Oh, no.

26:03.126 --> 26:06.086
No, no, no. Are you serious?

26:06.129 --> 26:07.783
Go get out of the car
and apologize to that person.You just stay

26:07.827 --> 26:10.264
right there.And say, "Hi, I'm Joy.
I'm crazy.

26:10.307 --> 26:13.267
I can't drive."
Talk to them.

26:13.310 --> 26:15.269
Oh, look at this.

26:15.312 --> 26:17.271
Come on, man.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.620
I am so sorry.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.361
Why did you slam
on your breaks?I-I just....

26:20.404 --> 26:22.537
The stop sign, and I...

26:22.581 --> 26:25.192
Just let me, uh...

26:25.235 --> 26:26.541
Let me get
my insurance information out.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.151
Just one second.

26:30.806 --> 26:33.069
Murphy?

26:33.113 --> 26:35.245
Murphy!

26:35.289 --> 26:38.771
Did you see
where my daughter went?No.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.645
MURPHY:
Hi. Uh, hello?

26:44.690 --> 26:46.039
Uh...

26:46.082 --> 26:48.868
Hi?Hi.

your address, please?

26:53.220 --> 26:55.135

26:55.178 --> 26:57.354
Sherwin connects to Dawson,

26:57.398 --> 26:59.356

26:59.400 --> 27:01.445
21 Sherwin Street.

27:01.489 --> 27:04.448
21. 21. Okay.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.363
Thank you.

27:06.407 --> 27:07.974
Okay, forward, Pretzel.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.585
Right. Right. Good.

27:10.629 --> 27:11.847

I really got to get going.

27:11.891 --> 27:14.154
Get out of my face.Um, okay.

27:14.197 --> 27:15.459
I'm not sure what
I'm supposed to do.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.070
I said get out of my face!

27:19.115 --> 27:21.335
Where'd she go?JOY:
Uh,

27:21.378 --> 27:25.208
she-she got out there
and headed that way, I think.

27:25.252 --> 27:27.558
Show us.

27:27.602 --> 27:30.257
She's on the move.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.650
We're with the mom in pursuit.

No.How in the hell

27:33.347 --> 27:36.219

Let's just go. Let's go.

Oh, my God. Sherwin Street.

28:35.888 --> 28:38.455

where she went.

She used to sneak
into this boy's house.

This way.All right, let's go. Let's go.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.682
You still live here?Uh,

29:58.187 --> 29:59.972
Go, go, go!

30:00.015 --> 30:01.974
Freeze!Brown sedan.

30:02.017 --> 30:03.540
Go, go, go.

30:03.584 --> 30:05.412
Where do I go?
Where do I go?!Away from here.

30:05.455 --> 30:07.588
Anywhere away from here.Oh, my God. Oh, my
God. Oh, my God.

30:07.631 --> 30:09.416
[siren wailing]Lose them somehow.

30:09.459 --> 30:11.157
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Um...

30:11.200 --> 30:13.115
Oh! I have an idea.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.378
Yeah, yeah, yeah.Hurry. Go, go, go, go, go.

30:15.422 --> 30:16.640
Please.Just calm down. Murphy!

30:16.684 --> 30:18.338
Just calm down, all right?Hurry!

30:18.381 --> 30:21.080
Yes, I got it.Why are you stopping?

30:21.123 --> 30:23.517
What are you doing?I still know
Neil Duncan's garage code.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.084
What the hell?

30:25.127 --> 30:26.650
Okay.

30:26.694 --> 30:28.304
[garage door whirring]

30:28.348 --> 30:31.264
Hurry. Hurry,
get in the... Hurry.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.876
[siren wailing]

30:44.407 --> 30:47.062
[panting]Oh, my God.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.936
Oh, my God. That
was so crazy.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.720
We'll just wait it out here
for a bit.

30:52.763 --> 30:54.853
Sure.Yeah.

30:54.896 --> 30:57.420
Thank you so much, Jared.

30:57.464 --> 30:58.857
Give me a hug.

31:00.902 --> 31:03.165
Thank you. You okay?

31:04.950 --> 31:06.342
Can I get in trouble for this?

31:06.386 --> 31:07.778
What I did?

31:07.822 --> 31:09.476
Oh, my God,
am I gonna go to jail?

31:09.519 --> 31:10.825
No, you're not
gonna go to jail.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.348
Just say
that I forced you into it.

31:12.392 --> 31:15.482
They already think
I'm some criminal mastermind.

31:15.525 --> 31:18.659
Okay. What did you do?

31:18.702 --> 31:20.835
I didn't do anything.[scoffs]

31:20.879 --> 31:23.794
And Jared, I'm really sorry
I-I... I roped you into this.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.667
I am. I feel bad. I'm...

31:26.710 --> 31:29.539
I'm looking for this guy,
and my phone's dead.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.715
A guy? You're worried
about finding some guy

31:31.759 --> 31:33.413
when there's, like, a
million cops after you?

31:33.456 --> 31:35.894
You remember Jess from high
school? My best friend Jess?

31:35.937 --> 31:37.417
Yes.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.811
Well, she's missing.

31:40.855 --> 31:43.510
And if I can find this guy,
I... I just...

31:43.553 --> 31:45.729
I think I might know
where she is.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.949
I-I don't know if I should.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.472
I mean, if you're, like,
wanted, I don't want to...

31:49.516 --> 31:51.126
Jared, I didn't...
I didn't do anything, okay?

31:51.170 --> 31:53.999
I didn't do anything,
and you know me.[scoffs]

31:54.042 --> 31:57.306
You've known me since
we were, like, little kids.

31:57.350 --> 32:00.701
Who are you gonna believe?
Me or some... some cops?

32:00.744 --> 32:02.964
[sighs]

32:03.008 --> 32:04.574
Come on.

32:04.618 --> 32:07.403
How am I supposed
to find this guy?

32:07.447 --> 32:09.971
[sighs]His name's Patrick Walker.

32:10.015 --> 32:12.017
He's in a rehab
somewhere in Chicago.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.932
That's all you know?

32:13.975 --> 32:15.890
Yes.

32:15.934 --> 32:18.284
Can you just start
calling places

32:18.327 --> 32:20.329
and see if we can find out
where he's at?

32:25.682 --> 32:28.598
I'm-I'm calling Les again.Dude, stop.

32:28.642 --> 32:30.296
If Sam called her,
she'd let you know. I promise.

32:31.340 --> 32:33.603
[sighs]

32:33.647 --> 32:35.997
[rapid tapping]

32:36.041 --> 32:38.217
Okay, you know what?
You're stressing me out.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.697
I'm gonna go, uh,
take a nap or something.

33:02.632 --> 33:04.591
[line ringing]

33:04.634 --> 33:06.462
SAM:
Hello?

33:06.506 --> 33:09.683
Hello, Sam.
Uh, it's-it's Felix.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.293
How'd you get this number?

33:11.337 --> 33:13.252
It doesn't matter. Look,

33:13.295 --> 33:16.342
um, I know you spoke
to my sister earlier.

33:17.647 --> 33:19.693
Told her I'd think about it.

33:19.736 --> 33:22.957
Okay. Well, what is there
to think about?

33:24.089 --> 33:26.787
Look, just let her
take on your case.

33:26.830 --> 33:28.484
You'll get a lot less time.

33:28.528 --> 33:32.488
Sam, I know you and I have had
our differences,

33:32.532 --> 33:35.839
but at the end of the day, we
have one major thing in common.

33:35.883 --> 33:37.841
We were both victims.

33:37.885 --> 33:39.321
The person

33:39.365 --> 33:42.237
who puppeteered
this whole thing is Nia.

33:42.281 --> 33:43.804
You should...

33:43.847 --> 33:46.067
She-She's the person
you should hate, not us.

33:48.374 --> 33:50.115
Hello? Sam?

33:50.158 --> 33:52.117
You weren't a victim.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.554
You murdered her.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.469
And you know what?

33:56.512 --> 33:59.602
I'd rather spend
the rest of my life in here

33:59.646 --> 34:01.648
than to help you
get away with it.

34:01.691 --> 34:03.215
Come on, Sam.

34:03.258 --> 34:05.130
And when Murphy does get caught,

34:05.173 --> 34:07.306
I'll be right here
waiting for her.

34:10.396 --> 34:12.311
Oh, no.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.182
[sniffles]Please, I...
We just need to know

34:14.226 --> 34:16.967
if Patrick Walker is a...
is a patient there.

34:17.011 --> 34:18.404
WOMAN:
I told you, we can't disclose

34:18.447 --> 34:20.667
that kind of information.
I'm sorry.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.799
Thank you.

34:22.843 --> 34:25.237
That's, like, the fifth
rehab place that's said that.

34:25.280 --> 34:26.760
I don't think this
is gonna work.

34:26.803 --> 34:29.328
Let's go to these places.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.330
Maybe I'll have
better luck in person.

34:31.373 --> 34:33.375
Okay. I'll put in the address.

34:33.419 --> 34:35.899
Then I promise
you can drop me off.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.033
[Jared clears throat]

34:39.077 --> 34:41.775
You're really a good guy,
Jared, you know that?

34:41.818 --> 34:43.907
You always have been.

34:43.951 --> 34:46.258
Shut up.

34:46.301 --> 34:50.697
I-I don't properly know how to
say thank you for all of this.

34:52.264 --> 34:54.483
Although I did give you
my virginity, so...

34:56.006 --> 34:58.487
Thank you for the charge, too.Yup, Uber driving--

34:58.531 --> 35:00.533
comes in handy.

35:00.576 --> 35:03.753
It was also... you know,
it was good to see you.

35:03.797 --> 35:07.192
It is really good to see
you... really good.

35:08.889 --> 35:11.848
Jared Johnson...
to the rescue.

35:11.892 --> 35:13.502
[laughs]

35:13.546 --> 35:15.548
Yeah.

35:22.076 --> 35:24.078
I'm just gonna...

35:24.122 --> 35:26.124
pull in here for a sec.

35:27.734 --> 35:30.563
We're already there?Uh...

35:30.606 --> 35:33.043
Oh.No. Murphy, look,

35:33.087 --> 35:36.177
I just, uh, have to
tell you something.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.961
What?

35:38.005 --> 35:41.617
â™ª We'll run away together...

35:41.661 --> 35:43.184
[groans]

35:43.228 --> 35:45.186
What are you doing?!

35:45.230 --> 35:47.188
I-I thought
it was clear.

35:47.232 --> 35:49.408
What? Keep your...
keep your tongue

35:49.451 --> 35:51.801
in your own mouth and drive.

35:51.845 --> 35:55.109
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, look
what I just did for you.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.893
[sighs]I'm such an idiot.

35:56.937 --> 35:59.418
You know what? I let you use me
all through high school.

35:59.461 --> 36:01.202
What?I'm done.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.856
Use you?Yeah.

36:02.899 --> 36:04.901
Jared, by having sex
with you every day?

36:04.945 --> 36:06.990
I'm sure that was hell.

36:07.034 --> 36:09.645
Can you just get out
of my car, please?

36:11.125 --> 36:13.083
Why?

36:13.127 --> 36:15.825
Cause I won't hook up with
you on the side of the road?

36:16.913 --> 36:18.872
Are you seriously
being that pathetic?

36:18.915 --> 36:22.049
Get out.Jared.

36:22.092 --> 36:24.051
Get out!

36:24.094 --> 36:27.881
I'll take that as a "yes." God.

36:34.583 --> 36:37.499
Come on, Pretzel.
Come on.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.197
Good luck
with your dumb app.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.941
[sighs]

36:50.425 --> 36:52.427
Please turn on.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.476
[sighs]

36:57.519 --> 37:01.915
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have five voice mails
from Unknown Number.

37:14.275 --> 37:19.019
Hey, how many times am I
gonna have to rescue you?

37:19.062 --> 37:22.501
[entry bell jingles]Follow, Pretzel.

37:22.544 --> 37:25.721
Hi. How can I help you?

37:25.765 --> 37:28.898
Uh, is Patrick Walker
being treated here?

37:28.942 --> 37:30.639
Are you the one that called?

37:30.683 --> 37:32.728
No.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.513
Like I said
over the phone,

37:34.556 --> 37:36.689
I can't disclose the names
of patients.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.995
Could you just ignore that
policy for, like, one minute?

37:39.039 --> 37:41.215
It's not a policy.
It's the law.

37:41.259 --> 37:42.651
Okay, this is an emergency.All the places

37:42.695 --> 37:44.305
have said the same thing.

37:44.349 --> 37:45.741
Sorry. Ma'am? Ma'am?I just need to know--
yes or no--

37:45.785 --> 37:47.134
is he in this building?You need to leave.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.135
Okay, Murphy, let's go.Just tell me if he's here!

37:48.178 --> 37:49.397
I can't answer
that question.

37:49.441 --> 37:50.703
Come on, Murphy.Oh, my God!

37:52.226 --> 37:53.967
Come on, let's just go.

37:54.010 --> 37:56.361
[entry bell jingles]

37:56.404 --> 38:00.278
[sighs]Murphy-- I
mean, I just...

38:00.321 --> 38:03.281
I can't understand how she
gets away... every time.

38:03.324 --> 38:06.588
I know. Literally
in the palm of my hand.

38:06.632 --> 38:10.070
This is Murphy.
In the palm of my hand. Poof.

38:10.113 --> 38:12.551
Disappeared.I know.
She's-she's...

38:12.594 --> 38:15.554
She's like Houdini.Mm.

38:15.597 --> 38:18.121
I'll see you two tomorrow.Mm.

38:19.514 --> 38:20.863
GENE:
See you later, man.Yeah.

38:20.907 --> 38:22.778
Good night.

38:22.822 --> 38:25.390
Yeah, just leave the door open
for the whole office to see me

38:25.433 --> 38:27.392
drinking on the job.There's nobody there.

38:27.435 --> 38:30.003
[sighs]

38:30.046 --> 38:31.744
Technically,
our shifts are over.

38:31.787 --> 38:33.746
And we still have
nothing to show for it.

38:33.789 --> 38:35.791
Mm.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.839
Poor Josh.

38:39.882 --> 38:42.494
I feel like I'm letting
him down at every turn.

38:42.537 --> 38:44.496
You are.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.498
Okay, I hate you.[both laugh]

38:46.541 --> 38:49.327
No, you don't.

38:53.548 --> 38:57.073
Um... I'm so sorry.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.945
It's fine. It's fine. I just...No. No, it's not.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.947
I'm technically your boss
now, and I-I just...

39:00.990 --> 39:02.383
It's not that.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.820
Okay, I should probably go, too.

39:04.864 --> 39:07.432
You want me to walk you
to the train, or...?

39:07.475 --> 39:10.609
Oh, my God, that sounded
so romantic. Okay.

39:10.652 --> 39:13.307
I'm-a go. Okay. Um...

39:14.482 --> 39:18.007
Do you...? Uh, I'm just...
I'm gonna call it a night.

39:18.051 --> 39:20.619
Okay, all right.
Nuh-night.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.925
Night.

39:24.971 --> 39:26.973
[sighs]

39:35.764 --> 39:39.638
â™ª At the dark end

39:39.681 --> 39:42.031
â™ª Of the street

39:44.077 --> 39:48.734
â™ª That's where we always meet

39:48.777 --> 39:51.432
â™ª Hiding in shadows

39:51.476 --> 39:53.434
â™ª Where we don't belong... Okay.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.305
Couch pulls out.

39:55.349 --> 39:56.829
There's some more blankets
in there if you need 'em.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.657
Thanks.I'm gonna
get a pizza.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.180
You guys want something?

40:00.223 --> 40:02.269
Yes, I'm starving.All right.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.709
â™ª At the dark end

40:07.753 --> 40:09.711
â™ª Of the street... Hey.

40:09.755 --> 40:11.365
You okay?

40:11.409 --> 40:14.455
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just...

40:14.499 --> 40:16.718
Still thinking about
that brother, huh?

40:16.762 --> 40:18.764
Yeah. [sniffles]

40:18.807 --> 40:20.896
I guess we're just
gonna have to wait

40:20.940 --> 40:22.768
until he checks out
of rehab or something.

40:22.811 --> 40:26.032
â™ª We have to pay
for the love we stole â™ª

40:26.075 --> 40:27.990
I don't have
that kind of time.

40:28.034 --> 40:30.079
â™ª

40:30.123 --> 40:31.646
I... I don't...

40:31.690 --> 40:35.694
â™ª To the dark end
of the street... â™ª

40:35.737 --> 40:37.696
I don't know what to do.

40:37.739 --> 40:40.307
[voice breaking]:
I just don't... I don't...

40:40.350 --> 40:42.396
[crying]:
I don't know what to do.Hey.

40:42.440 --> 40:44.224
Hey, you're
gonna be okay.

40:44.267 --> 40:45.704
[crying]:
I don't...

40:45.747 --> 40:47.619
Hey, come here.

40:47.662 --> 40:49.795
No.Come here. Come
here. Come here.

40:49.838 --> 40:53.451
[crying]

40:53.494 --> 40:55.627
[crying]:
I'm so tired.

40:55.670 --> 40:57.933
I know.

40:57.977 --> 41:01.546
â™ª At the dark end
of the street... â™ª
