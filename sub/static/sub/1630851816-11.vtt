WEBVTT

00:44.461 --> 00:47.380
ALL CHARACTERS, ORGANIZATIONS
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

00:48.381 --> 00:49.674
YEAR 1985

00:49.758 --> 00:50.675
Let's go.

00:53.553 --> 00:54.471
Kiddo.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.806
-Clean it up.
-Okay.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.855
Detective.

01:04.731 --> 01:07.108
I'm sorry for asking this, Detective.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.737
But could I have some water?

01:11.404 --> 01:12.238
I'm…

01:12.739 --> 01:14.324
I'm so thirsty.

01:14.991 --> 01:20.580
<i>-It's raining on Yeongdong Bridge
-It's raining on Yeongdong Bridge</i>

01:20.663 --> 01:24.042
<i>-Trying to forget but I can't
-Trying to forget but I can't</i>

01:24.125 --> 01:25.502
Why are you standing up?

01:31.090 --> 01:34.677
Hey, kiddo. Are you in a really good mood?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.638
His father-in-law is Lim In-gwan,

01:36.721 --> 01:38.807
who is really close
to a powerful politician.

01:38.890 --> 01:42.227
So once we wrap up
the One Family Welfare Center case,

01:42.310 --> 01:43.645
he'll be on the fast track for promotions.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.194
Thank you.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.322
-Did you have enough?
-Yes. Thank you.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.703
Detective.

02:02.580 --> 02:05.083
Could you tell me your name?

02:06.209 --> 02:07.627
-What?
-Well,

02:08.962 --> 02:11.548
I owe my life to you.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.841
Don't say that.

02:21.975 --> 02:22.851
Hyung-in.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.645
The name is Choi Hyung-in.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.690
Thank you for telling me.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.861
Thank you, Detective Choi Hyung-in.

02:33.945 --> 02:35.155
My name is…

02:35.238 --> 02:36.489
You don't have to tell me. I already know.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.575
My name is Jo Kyung-ho.

02:39.325 --> 02:42.495
I'm Jo Kyung-ho, Detective Choi Hyung-in.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.998
I'm Jo Kyung-ho.

02:45.832 --> 02:48.209
My name is Jo Kyung-ho.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.797
Detective. My name is Jo Kyung-ho.

02:52.881 --> 02:53.715
Could you

02:54.382 --> 02:56.926
bring all the <i>dongdongju</i> wine you have?

02:57.010 --> 02:58.344
We'll order all of it.

02:58.428 --> 02:59.804
Wow.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.099
The kiddo knows how to party.
He's a real man.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.018
Let's drink all night.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.185
Have a drink.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.145
Senior detectives.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.897
I took off my pants, as you can see.

03:10.189 --> 03:12.150
And I'll drink all night so…

03:12.734 --> 03:13.610
I'd like to

03:15.361 --> 03:18.072
be taken off this case. I'm sorry.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.451
I'll do whatever you tell me
to do tonight.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.828
Hey, kiddo. You're drunk. So sit down now.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.955
-No, I won't sit down.
-I said sit down, you bastard!

03:28.333 --> 03:29.876
Fine! Damn it!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.753
Call me a bastard all you want.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.048
-I'll put up with any insults.
-Why you!

03:35.131 --> 03:37.300
Do whatever you want to me.
Beat me up or kill me.

03:37.383 --> 03:39.552
But I can't do this anymore.
I quit this case.

03:39.636 --> 03:40.637
I've had enough.

03:41.679 --> 03:42.680
Okay?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.475
I've had enough!

03:54.400 --> 03:55.985
OVERSEAS PUBLIC SECURITY HEAD OFFICE

04:38.152 --> 04:39.237
Damn it.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.577
Mister…

04:47.662 --> 04:50.748
Can I ask you for a little favor?

05:01.676 --> 05:03.594
SOOK CHINESE RESTAURANT

05:05.513 --> 05:07.390
I asked my aunt and grandma

05:09.183 --> 05:11.561
to move back here.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.065
They probably didn't want to
come back to this town.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.443
I insisted that we move here.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.237
Why did you want to come here?

05:23.781 --> 05:24.949
Jo Kyung-ho.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.954
He said he would tell me about my mom.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.959
He said my late mom had

05:36.753 --> 05:38.629
left behind traces in this town

05:41.674 --> 05:44.302
which I could see for myself if I came.

05:47.680 --> 05:51.434
I stubbornly insisted that
my family move back here.

05:54.562 --> 05:57.315
If I hadn't been so stubborn,
do you think Lee Kyung-jin

05:59.400 --> 06:00.568
would be still alive?

06:01.569 --> 06:03.279
And what's happening to my aunt now…

06:05.364 --> 06:07.450
Would none of this had happened?

06:18.753 --> 06:21.047
Nobody will pass through
this underpass today, right?

06:21.130 --> 06:24.217
Who would come here
when it's raining so hard?

06:24.300 --> 06:25.259
Right.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.595
Let's head home before it gets dark.

06:29.514 --> 06:30.890
I don't like putting out the candles.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.642
Don't obsess over that.

06:32.725 --> 06:35.686
How can a candle burn
for 24 hours straight?

06:35.770 --> 06:37.146
Leave her alone.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.816
She comes here every day
at the break of dawn, you know.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.275
And lights the candles
that went out overnight.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.029
Moon-sook can be so determined.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.281
Wonder why you don't study
with that kind of determination.

06:47.365 --> 06:48.991
-I just like this.
-Like what?

06:49.075 --> 06:51.536
Jae-young likes a nostalgic mood.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.371
So if she were to come here

06:53.454 --> 06:56.541
and see these candles,
it would make her feel so great.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.055
Good thing we didn't leave yet.

07:11.139 --> 07:12.640
Someone is coming.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.007
Moon-sook.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.427
I came.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.907
Don't cry.

08:12.074 --> 08:13.409
I missed you so much.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.795
SISTER, PLEASE COME HOME BEFORE WINTER

08:24.879 --> 08:26.839
HOPE YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SPEND
CHRISTMAS WITH YOUR FAMILY

08:27.548 --> 08:29.884
You waited for me this whole time.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.930
Thanks so much.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.057
It

08:36.974 --> 08:38.768
wasn't just us who were waiting.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.561
Your aunt set this up.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.605
It was your aunt who moved

08:42.688 --> 08:44.190
the hearts of the townspeople.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.400
She never gave up.

08:50.112 --> 08:51.197
I see.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.202
Nobody seems to be coming.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.206
We told all the followers that you,

09:00.289 --> 09:02.166
the successor, would be here today.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.677
Nobody is here. It's an empty room.

09:16.180 --> 09:19.433
It's disappointing that you don't
have the trust of our followers.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.311
What are you looking at?

09:22.895 --> 09:24.313
Am I not welcome here?

09:26.107 --> 09:27.900
I need to watch over you

09:27.984 --> 09:30.736
to make sure that you are carrying on

09:30.820 --> 09:34.115
Guru's visions through your teachings

09:34.198 --> 09:36.450
and see how well your escape plan
is coming along.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.248
Isn't they why you came here
on your own volition?

09:42.331 --> 09:43.833
Your plan was to
let Guru's daughter escape

09:43.916 --> 09:45.626
and when you got the chance,
you'd escape, too.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.003
Believe whatever you want.

09:49.505 --> 09:51.465
But did you know this, Jung-hyun?

09:54.885 --> 09:57.179
Before your plan even gets off the ground,

09:57.263 --> 09:59.015
the Day of Purification will happen.

09:59.890 --> 10:00.891
You're already late.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.977
The future cannot be altered.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.021
We will reach the end
of the predetermined future

10:05.104 --> 10:06.147
and reach salvation.

10:06.856 --> 10:10.276
Why would you want to die like a dog?

10:10.359 --> 10:11.777
What do you get out of it?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.199
Don't question me.

10:18.492 --> 10:20.161
You don't know anything.

10:20.244 --> 10:22.371
You're not the successor and never were.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.832
Do you really believe

10:26.042 --> 10:27.251
that this is worth

10:28.252 --> 10:31.505
sacrificing your life for?

10:33.090 --> 10:34.258
You better shut up.

10:35.259 --> 10:37.845
You'll be helping me tomorrow.

10:37.928 --> 10:40.306
You just have to carry the bag
to Saju Station…

10:40.389 --> 10:44.060
Then release the nerve gas
after you get a signal from Jung-hyun.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.995
<i>Do you remember the room you locked us in?</i>

11:04.372 --> 11:06.999
It was pitch dark inside that room.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.335
I couldn't even see my own hands.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.005
When I was in there,

11:13.881 --> 11:16.967
I had no sense of sound or smell.

11:17.051 --> 11:21.263
That dark room
was the definition of darkness.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.057
I only spent an hour there at first.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.851
Even that felt like an eternity.

11:25.935 --> 11:29.313
But I was able to endure it.
There was no way out, anyway.

11:30.231 --> 11:33.859
For three hours, five hours and ten hours…

11:34.860 --> 11:38.406
At some point,
you locked us in there all night.

11:40.741 --> 11:45.246
In that dark room, I had an experience
that shattered the boundaries of time.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.043
The lines between the past,

11:52.086 --> 11:54.505
present, and future began to fade away.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.594
Suddenly, a lot of things
started to change.

12:02.513 --> 12:07.017
I was who I was
but also without an identity.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.771
I was cut off

12:10.855 --> 12:13.858
but connected to everything
at the same time.

12:18.529 --> 12:23.159
That was probably around the time
I found the ability to control ants.

12:24.952 --> 12:26.829
You could say

12:30.249 --> 12:33.961
all of that was a gift from you to me.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.217
You remember all of it?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.761
I told you that I don't remember events.

12:43.471 --> 12:47.057
There are no lines
between the past and present.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.769
What happened in that dark room

12:53.397 --> 12:55.900
is occurring in this moment as well.

12:57.818 --> 12:58.736
I'm sorry.

12:59.361 --> 13:00.571
I really am.

13:03.073 --> 13:05.034
What I did was unforgivable.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.954
But could you please spare my life?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.834
For the sake of my young son.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.393
When you'd unlock the door to the room,

13:33.312 --> 13:34.855
you would look at us

13:37.608 --> 13:40.778
with glee while drunk as we were dying.

13:44.698 --> 13:47.284
Do you remember
what you would always say to us?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.330
I still vividly remember.

13:54.208 --> 13:57.878
Why are these half-breeds
still not dead yet?

14:54.685 --> 14:56.520
You're a changed person, eh?

15:39.688 --> 15:41.273
Wow.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.037
What's this smell?

15:55.704 --> 15:56.664
It's dusty.

15:57.831 --> 16:01.001
The detective said
he hasn't been home for a while.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.921
Is it really all right for us
to stay here?

16:04.505 --> 16:06.465
Wouldn't it be too inconvenient?

16:06.548 --> 16:07.967
Oh, it's fine.

16:08.592 --> 16:09.843
I'm hardly at home most days.

16:09.927 --> 16:12.930
But you need to be home
and watch over them.

16:13.013 --> 16:18.185
Mrs. Jo, we are keeping it a secret
that Jo Jae-young has been found.

16:18.268 --> 16:21.355
Until we arrest
every Youngjin Sect cult member,

16:21.438 --> 16:23.816
you're not safe
at your home or at the restaurant.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.652
It still must be an inconvenience.

16:26.735 --> 16:27.611
It's really okay.

16:28.320 --> 16:29.697
Come to the precinct with me.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.700
Mrs. Jo, will you be fine
until he comes back?

16:32.783 --> 16:34.451
It won't take long.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.828
Of course, it's fine.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.747
I'll look after them
until they go to sleep.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.541
Don't worry. Take care of your business.

16:43.293 --> 16:45.879
What's that? That's embarrassing.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.715
You brought a doll?

16:48.590 --> 16:53.012
I've never slept over at someone's house.
I can't sleep without my doll.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.513
I should've brought my doll, too.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.390
I didn't bring it
because I thought you'd tease me.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.642
I can't stand it.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.067
What's this? Are you sleeping?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.446
You're supposed to be a tough guy.

17:28.422 --> 17:29.423
Is this true?

17:30.424 --> 17:33.135
This is a big accusation, you know.

17:33.218 --> 17:36.638
That Professor Jang of the Haegol Gang
is a sitting senator.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.140
If it turns out you're wrong,

17:38.223 --> 17:40.768
this will blow up in your face.

17:40.851 --> 17:41.935
No.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.607
I also suspected that the professor
was someone in politics.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.653
You're certain it's him?

17:51.737 --> 17:52.946
Detective.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.949
Do you know that my boss is dead?

17:56.033 --> 17:57.826
You mean, Kang Yong-tak?

17:57.910 --> 18:00.996
Don't you think
they're the ones who did it?

18:01.830 --> 18:03.749
LIM IN-GWAN

18:10.422 --> 18:14.426
I don't care if the Haegol Gang,
Youngjin Sect or the senator did it.

18:14.510 --> 18:15.844
All I care about

18:16.470 --> 18:20.307
is avenging my boss' death.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.862
Excuse me. I heard
you were close to Jae-young.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.532
Was Jae-young fine while she was here?

18:36.615 --> 18:40.119
I don't know. I hardly talked to her.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.331
Oh really?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.793
I guess I misheard.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.130
I was told that you were close to her.

18:51.213 --> 18:55.801
No. She didn't care at all about me.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.471
She only thought about using me to escape.

19:01.473 --> 19:04.768
That's the story of my life.
I never had a real friend.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.812
People have always tried to use me.

19:07.396 --> 19:10.023
But I know why.
Because I don't have strength.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.942
I'm weak in spirit
which is why I'm like this.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.111
You know…

19:16.196 --> 19:17.489
Why are you lying?

19:19.366 --> 19:20.868
You think I don't know?

19:20.951 --> 19:22.202
About Jae-young?

19:26.665 --> 19:28.041
Your name is Shi-young, right?

19:28.792 --> 19:29.877
Can I ask you

19:30.836 --> 19:33.589
how long you've been
living here, Shi-young?

19:33.672 --> 19:36.592
How many years have the followers

19:37.926 --> 19:39.094
been trapped here?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.345
What's it to you?

19:40.429 --> 19:43.307
You're going to abandon us
and leave just like Jae-young.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.810
Or are you going to be with us
on the Day of Purification?

19:48.270 --> 19:49.521
You're not planning to.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.607
So why the heck did you come here?

20:34.274 --> 20:37.486
You had this secret spot all to yourself?

20:44.368 --> 20:48.580
Yeah. It would be quiet here
even during lunch recess.

20:49.331 --> 20:52.000
Sometimes, I would come
and eat my lunch here alone.

21:01.176 --> 21:02.344
I have something to tell you.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.263
I

21:04.972 --> 21:06.056
want to live with you

21:07.766 --> 21:09.559
in a home for the two of us.

21:10.143 --> 21:11.228
And I want to

21:12.187 --> 21:13.939
go home every day

21:16.650 --> 21:18.068
holding your hand.

21:22.072 --> 21:22.948
Will you

21:24.866 --> 21:26.159
marry me?

21:47.347 --> 21:49.683
Se-yoon. Let's get out of here quickly.

21:51.893 --> 21:52.894
Se-yoon.

22:12.789 --> 22:14.583
Excuse me, Mister.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.251
Oh, okay.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.171
Do you need anything?

22:19.254 --> 22:20.589
Are you all right?

22:29.264 --> 22:30.307
What is this?

22:31.349 --> 22:32.517
It's coke tea.

22:33.268 --> 22:34.144
Coke what?

22:34.227 --> 22:36.438
It's warm coke.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.365
When I couldn't sleep,

22:47.449 --> 22:49.743
my aunt would give me warm coke
without telling grandma.

22:49.826 --> 22:51.620
It'll help you fall asleep.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.095
How does it taste?
It's pretty good, isn't it?

23:14.935 --> 23:17.938
Do you have nightmares often?

23:19.064 --> 23:20.232
Yes, most of the time.

23:20.315 --> 23:21.775
Since when?

23:21.858 --> 23:23.068
I don't know.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.195
I don't remember

23:26.404 --> 23:27.781
when they started.

23:28.949 --> 23:30.367
Did it start

23:30.450 --> 23:33.870
when you lost your baby?

23:34.621 --> 23:37.582
I was curious so we entered

23:38.333 --> 23:39.793
that bedroom.

23:40.836 --> 23:42.003
The baby's room.

23:43.421 --> 23:46.550
I was going to tell you we saw the room.

23:46.633 --> 23:49.052
But you came home late.

23:51.012 --> 23:53.515
I'm sorry we didn't respect your privacy.

23:54.099 --> 23:55.100
No, it's all right.

23:56.059 --> 23:57.394
Don't let it bother you.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.480
Did you divorce your wife

24:01.773 --> 24:03.733
because you lost your baby?

24:05.527 --> 24:06.695
I see.

24:07.445 --> 24:08.947
So that's what you're curious about.

24:13.577 --> 24:14.828
No, that's not the reason.

24:15.829 --> 24:16.872
She left

24:17.998 --> 24:19.666
because she didn't like me anymore.

24:21.042 --> 24:24.713
I found out
she had a miscarriage much later.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.131
She informed me about it.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.135
There's no need for you to dwell on it.

24:32.470 --> 24:34.764
Your aunt asked me to care for you.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.476
I can see how she might have felt guilty.

24:39.561 --> 24:42.189
My wife and Jo Kyung-ho

24:42.981 --> 24:44.316
are your parents.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.902
So she probably got worried

24:48.320 --> 24:50.071
about how I would react to that.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.118
I wanted to ask you

24:57.204 --> 24:59.789
how you felt about me.

25:02.542 --> 25:03.585
My wife

25:05.003 --> 25:07.047
didn't give me an explanation
when she left.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.342
Which means she couldn't
stand living with me.

25:11.426 --> 25:15.764
So I don't think I have the right
to judge the choice she made.

25:16.806 --> 25:17.933
I don't think

25:18.767 --> 25:21.770
I should harbor any ill will
towards you either.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.773
I'm not sure
if that answers your question.

25:27.651 --> 25:28.902
It's late. So go to sleep.

25:29.736 --> 25:30.570
But…

25:31.571 --> 25:33.657
I don't think people

25:33.740 --> 25:36.326
leave their families without a reason.

25:37.285 --> 25:41.164
I think there was a deeper reason
that she couldn't tell you.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.417
Because she cared a lot.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.128
That's how it is with me and my aunt.

25:50.632 --> 25:51.800
You can't

25:53.843 --> 25:56.137
explain everything to your family.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.791
This is the room
for ascetic training, right?

26:24.874 --> 26:27.252
You hang people upside down
here every night.

26:28.086 --> 26:28.962
Well…

26:29.546 --> 26:32.257
We learned that it's important training

26:33.091 --> 26:35.302
to understand the true meaning
of Guru's teachings.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.222
I really don't like all of you.

26:40.890 --> 26:42.600
But you shouldn't be doing this.

26:44.602 --> 26:45.937
This isn't training.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.148
It's plainly

26:49.566 --> 26:50.692
torture.

26:52.986 --> 26:54.404
There's no other way to describe it.

27:04.831 --> 27:07.000
I find myself back here
after all those years.

27:11.087 --> 27:12.213
I told you so.

27:13.423 --> 27:15.675
Nothing has changed.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.679
-Oh my goodness.
-What to do?

27:19.763 --> 27:22.766
What is the meaning of this?
How dare you shout in this room!

27:33.651 --> 27:35.070
What do you think you're doing?

27:43.995 --> 27:45.914
You think what you did
will make a difference?

27:46.873 --> 27:49.417
Are you trying to act like a hero?

27:50.377 --> 27:52.420
We can install a new rope.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.047
What you did is meaningless.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.320
What are you doing?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.618
Stop it. Are you crazy?

28:46.015 --> 28:48.226
I wasn't waiting for the
rope to burn to ash.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.478
I wanted to show everyone that

28:50.562 --> 28:52.856
there is no such thing as a rope
that can't be cut down.

29:05.285 --> 29:06.911
Thank you for coming.

29:13.376 --> 29:14.627
We're done, sir.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.427
Would you please excuse me?

29:22.510 --> 29:24.012
I have to receive a guest.

29:24.554 --> 29:26.222
-I'm so sorry.
-That's fine.

29:39.569 --> 29:40.862
Now look here.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.281
Don't you have any manners?

29:44.032 --> 29:46.409
How could you come barging here

29:47.076 --> 29:49.037
when I'm having dinner
with family and relatives?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.872
And you also brought a knife with you.

29:51.414 --> 29:54.584
We've met before, haven't we?

29:54.667 --> 29:57.253
I think I met you
at the summer house before.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.716
I don't think we started off
on the right foot back then.

30:02.759 --> 30:03.885
Now I remember.

30:04.761 --> 30:07.305
You were with Kang Yong-tak, weren't you?

30:07.388 --> 30:08.431
That's right.

30:09.140 --> 30:12.185
I came to avenge my boss' death.

30:12.268 --> 30:15.438
You're not making any sense, fella.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.274
I'm not the one who did that to him.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.985
Why did you come to
the wrong place for vengeance?

30:21.069 --> 30:25.532
I just do business with the Youngjin Sect.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.748
Did you know

30:34.582 --> 30:37.001
that the place where your boss died

30:37.961 --> 30:40.380
is where the Youngjin Sect gather to pray?

30:41.673 --> 30:45.301
And the representative who leads
the Youngjin Sect is a sly fox.

30:45.385 --> 30:48.680
Objectively speaking,

30:48.763 --> 30:50.265
it's the representative's fault

30:51.140 --> 30:52.976
that your boss died like that.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.562
So if you want revenge,

30:55.645 --> 30:57.981
you should go after him.

31:00.942 --> 31:03.528
Hey, untie his hands.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.531
You tied his hands so tight

31:06.614 --> 31:08.533
that they're turning purple.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.290
If you want to accomplish a lot in life,

31:15.373 --> 31:17.709
you need to be able to tell
who's friend or foe.

31:17.792 --> 31:21.170
Seeing the spirit you have,

31:21.254 --> 31:23.715
I just came up with a fantastic idea.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.425
Would you like to hear it?

31:25.508 --> 31:29.596
I'm thinking about giving you
a compass that will lead you straight

31:30.763 --> 31:33.391
to the representative's room.

31:35.059 --> 31:36.394
That's my idea.

32:27.028 --> 32:28.404
Why did you come here?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.282
I've always wanted to come here.

32:32.283 --> 32:33.451
Where are we?

32:42.293 --> 32:43.461
It's just

32:44.712 --> 32:45.797
the school I graduated from.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.899
"Just the school I graduated from."

33:24.127 --> 33:25.169
Mister.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.547
Take a look at this.

33:30.049 --> 33:33.428
I asked Jae-young about it
and she said she didn't write it.

33:34.262 --> 33:37.932
And the text messages they got
weren't sent by me.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.685
Someone was pretending to be me.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.272
Who could have done this? For what?

33:46.441 --> 33:47.775
It was a ploy

33:47.859 --> 33:49.986
to lure your aunt to the cult.

33:51.112 --> 33:52.530
They wanted to release you

33:52.613 --> 33:55.742
and have your aunt take your place.

33:57.785 --> 33:58.703
I…

33:59.662 --> 34:02.749
want to go to the seven secret spots
mentioned here.

34:03.583 --> 34:08.337
It could help me find out
where I was held and where my aunt

34:08.421 --> 34:09.922
could be right now.

34:13.760 --> 34:17.263
I don't know what this person wants
but we have to stop him.

34:17.346 --> 34:18.431
I want to stop this.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.820
GYEONGCHEON HIGH SCHOOL MAGAZINE
IS SEARCHING FOR CLUES!

35:13.903 --> 35:15.822
PLEASE SEND IN ANY TIPS YOU MAY HAVE

36:27.310 --> 36:30.188
FIRST SECRET PLACE IS THE SAJU
DEER FARM. ITS TRUE PURPOSE?

36:44.869 --> 36:46.037
I'm okay.

36:48.331 --> 36:51.500
For real. So don't cry.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.850
Can I see your hand?

37:30.790 --> 37:31.624
Successor.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.419
You need to stop.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.756
We've already made up our minds.

37:40.716 --> 37:42.301
You're too late.

37:43.761 --> 37:44.762
So

37:46.430 --> 37:47.682
leave us alone.

37:51.894 --> 37:52.895
Please.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.066
I won't rush anyone.

37:57.149 --> 37:59.360
I'll just continue staying in my place.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.571
So if you ever change your mind,

38:02.655 --> 38:03.990
come to me.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.658
Even if it's just once.

38:05.741 --> 38:06.617
Give me

38:08.035 --> 38:09.328
a chance.

38:54.123 --> 38:57.418
Thank you for coming.
I was waiting for you.

38:58.210 --> 39:01.505
Everyone. I am not the successor.

39:02.548 --> 39:06.135
So I don't have the right
to impart any teachings.

39:06.802 --> 39:08.137
I know that

39:09.805 --> 39:12.350
what I'm saying is not what you expected.

39:21.442 --> 39:25.905
However, I thought I could do something
even as an insignificant person.

39:31.702 --> 39:32.661
Everyone.

39:32.745 --> 39:35.206
Raise your chin. Look into my eyes.

39:35.956 --> 39:37.333
Please.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.959
And come to me and

39:39.668 --> 39:40.586
tell me

39:41.587 --> 39:42.963
your story.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.299
It doesn't matter what you share with me.

39:46.967 --> 39:48.260
Let me

39:50.054 --> 39:51.347
hear your voices.

40:04.610 --> 40:05.653
Will you

40:06.737 --> 40:08.489
really listen to my story?

40:10.408 --> 40:11.367
Yes,

40:12.618 --> 40:13.577
go ahead.

40:13.661 --> 40:14.578
Anything

40:15.371 --> 40:16.372
you want to say.

40:17.581 --> 40:18.457
I'm

40:20.126 --> 40:21.460
an orphan.

40:22.378 --> 40:23.754
My parents

40:24.922 --> 40:28.259
died in the 1987 terrorist attack
at Saju Station.

40:28.342 --> 40:30.678
I moved from one relative's house
to another.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.847
I never went to school.

40:43.107 --> 40:44.191
I think this is it.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.292
Do you think it'll be safe to go in?

41:04.587 --> 41:05.629
Is it?

41:07.965 --> 41:09.467
Mister.

41:09.550 --> 41:10.509
Oh, okay.

41:10.593 --> 41:13.220
-You're coming too, right?
-Of course.

41:21.353 --> 41:26.192
My fiancee was helping out
at her parent's shop in the station.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.320
She cared more about her family

41:31.155 --> 41:34.325
and me than herself.

41:37.077 --> 41:40.581
When the paramedics
retrieved grandma's body,

41:41.290 --> 41:43.417
they found a half-eaten taffy
in her pocket.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.919
She had trouble walking

41:45.628 --> 41:47.796
but she walked to the station

41:49.673 --> 41:52.301
and waited there for me
while sucking on the taffy.

41:53.135 --> 41:55.804
My grandma appears in my dreams a lot.

41:56.805 --> 41:57.765
And I'll

41:59.767 --> 42:00.851
speak to her while crying.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.938
Grandma, don't

42:05.940 --> 42:07.358
come to the station to pick me up.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.110
Please stay home.

42:12.905 --> 42:14.573
Grandma, please don't die.

42:17.451 --> 42:18.285
My husband

42:19.036 --> 42:20.704
worked at the train station.

42:21.288 --> 42:24.083
I was told he died
while saving other people

42:24.166 --> 42:25.334
in the station.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.547
Why didn't he just save himself first?

42:30.798 --> 42:33.884
I hate him
more than I hate the perpetrators.

42:34.510 --> 42:37.846
Why are you bringing up painful memories?

42:41.100 --> 42:43.310
We've already made up our minds.

42:45.354 --> 42:47.022
All of the people here

42:47.898 --> 42:49.775
have lost a loved one

42:51.402 --> 42:53.404
at Saju Station on the day of the attack.

42:54.738 --> 42:57.449
They've endured a pain
that's worse than dying.

42:58.951 --> 43:01.120
We want salvation now.

43:01.954 --> 43:03.581
We've been forgotten by society.

43:03.664 --> 43:04.999
As time went by,

43:05.874 --> 43:07.585
people have completely forgotten

43:08.919 --> 43:10.212
the painful experience

43:11.797 --> 43:14.675
we underwent.

43:15.676 --> 43:18.178
That is why we've chosen this path.

43:19.388 --> 43:20.431
Because Guru

43:23.350 --> 43:25.811
has told us he'd join us.

43:27.605 --> 43:28.731
He said

43:29.607 --> 43:31.942
he would share our pain.

43:33.068 --> 43:36.447
But who are you?

43:37.072 --> 43:40.451
What the heck can you do for us?

43:41.619 --> 43:44.913
You suddenly show up
and try to test our beliefs?

43:46.040 --> 43:46.957
Damn it.

43:50.878 --> 43:54.006
Why are you looking at us like that?

44:09.396 --> 44:10.522
I'm sorry

44:13.400 --> 44:14.985
for neglecting all of you.

44:16.737 --> 44:18.405
I wanted to forget.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.991
I wanted to stay as far away as possible.

44:22.743 --> 44:24.328
That way, I thought

44:25.954 --> 44:28.165
I could erase that incident.

44:29.667 --> 44:31.251
But I was very wrong.

44:33.420 --> 44:35.130
I should've met each of you.

44:36.173 --> 44:37.591
And listened

44:39.051 --> 44:40.135
to what

44:41.178 --> 44:42.429
you had to say.

44:43.430 --> 44:46.266
Someone should've apologized to you.

44:48.602 --> 44:50.729
An apology was in order.

44:54.274 --> 44:55.317
I'm sorry.

44:56.819 --> 44:58.028
I'm sorry for

44:59.530 --> 45:01.115
coming so late and forgetting.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.660
I'm sorry.

45:06.703 --> 45:08.205
I'm very sorry.

45:10.165 --> 45:11.542
I'm sorry.

45:12.793 --> 45:14.211
I'm so sorry.

45:15.295 --> 45:16.505
I'm sorry.

45:22.469 --> 45:24.012
Moon-sook told me

45:26.098 --> 45:27.474
that someone died here

45:28.517 --> 45:30.144
in a fire.

45:37.818 --> 45:38.986
That drawing.

45:41.238 --> 45:42.573
Jo Kyung-ho.

45:42.656 --> 45:44.533
I think Jo Kyung-ho came here.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.171
What's wrong, Mister?

46:00.048 --> 46:01.258
Are you okay?

46:06.346 --> 46:07.306
I knew it.

46:08.140 --> 46:09.141
Now I know.

46:09.975 --> 46:10.851
What?

46:12.478 --> 46:15.439
The seven secret spots are all

46:15.522 --> 46:17.107
related to my wife.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.234
I've been to each place

46:20.152 --> 46:22.279
with my wife before we got married.

46:22.362 --> 46:24.865
She wanted to show me around her hometown.

46:30.078 --> 46:30.913
Then…

46:31.663 --> 46:35.000
"Let's return to our home" means…

46:47.304 --> 46:50.724
This is where I proposed to my wife.

46:53.018 --> 46:54.728
So Jo Kyung-ho

46:56.813 --> 46:58.941
has always wanted me to realize it.

46:59.858 --> 47:00.734
Something

47:02.486 --> 47:04.530
I should never forget.

47:06.114 --> 47:07.783
But he's accusing me of forgetting.

47:10.619 --> 47:11.954
That's why he came back here.

47:13.539 --> 47:14.915
To tell me that.

48:03.505 --> 48:05.716
You're home? My son.

48:06.466 --> 48:08.385
You've returned.

48:10.137 --> 48:12.639
I see something I don't want to see.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.309
Your end.

48:16.935 --> 48:18.061
Son.

48:23.275 --> 48:24.735
Have you eaten?

48:25.777 --> 48:27.487
Are you hungry, son?

48:53.221 --> 48:56.642
My dad and I used to
come here often when I was little.

48:57.392 --> 49:01.104
Dad used to be
an ordinary person and very kind.

49:06.443 --> 49:08.487
But you don't understand something.

49:09.488 --> 49:11.990
You can't stop this.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.325
Everything

49:14.117 --> 49:15.452
is predetermined.

49:16.703 --> 49:17.663
Really?

49:21.166 --> 49:24.503
Then should I just
do nothing in that case?

49:25.170 --> 49:26.963
If I can't change your mind,

49:27.047 --> 49:29.049
I'm supposed to do nothing?

49:29.633 --> 49:31.551
You expect me to turn a blind eye to

49:31.635 --> 49:33.762
the awful thing that happened to your dad

49:33.845 --> 49:35.347
when he was framed?

49:40.018 --> 49:41.186
Am I

49:41.853 --> 49:43.563
supposed to do nothing

49:44.439 --> 49:48.735
when you're trying to kill my family
and the people of my town?

49:49.653 --> 49:50.696
I already told you.

49:51.321 --> 49:53.448
Whatever you say or do
won't change anything.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.868
So there's no need
for you to risk your life.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.001
So you can see my future?

50:07.963 --> 50:09.923
But I'm not going to avoid what awaits me.

50:13.176 --> 50:14.469
I can't do that.

50:27.274 --> 50:28.734
I'm not afraid.

50:31.194 --> 50:32.571
I'm not afraid.

50:59.806 --> 51:00.932
Did you watch this tape?

51:02.851 --> 51:03.852
Son.

51:05.562 --> 51:06.730
My poor son.

51:08.356 --> 51:09.775
Why did you do that?

51:11.568 --> 51:12.986
Why did my son

51:14.154 --> 51:18.158
do such a terrible thing
to the townspeople?

51:19.659 --> 51:22.496
My heart had turned to stone.

51:22.579 --> 51:23.622
I…

51:26.166 --> 51:27.793
Is it my fault

51:30.545 --> 51:32.130
that you became like that?

51:36.092 --> 51:37.427
Let me ask you one thing.

51:40.847 --> 51:41.765
Son.

51:42.724 --> 51:44.768
Were you not able to forget that day?

51:46.102 --> 51:48.104
When your dad was on his deathbed,

51:49.397 --> 51:52.567
he said to us,

51:53.735 --> 51:55.028
"Let's all die

51:57.113 --> 52:00.033
together as a family."

52:03.119 --> 52:04.204
I held

52:06.081 --> 52:08.333
your hand and Jung-hyun's tightly.

52:10.001 --> 52:11.878
With anger in my voice I told him,

52:12.712 --> 52:14.798
"Come to your senses, Husband.

52:16.466 --> 52:19.386
How could you say such utter nonsense?"

52:20.345 --> 52:23.640
And he replied.

52:24.432 --> 52:25.767
"Because we're family and

52:27.978 --> 52:29.187
because I love you,

52:30.230 --> 52:31.857
I can't leave you behind."

52:33.733 --> 52:35.485
"You crazy man.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.237
You pathetic human.

52:38.029 --> 52:40.824
No, never.

52:40.907 --> 52:44.035
Don't even think about
taking them with you.

52:45.996 --> 52:47.247
If you want to die.

52:53.670 --> 52:55.130
Then die alone.

52:59.342 --> 53:00.302
Die

53:05.807 --> 53:06.933
alone."

54:09.287 --> 54:10.497
Run away.

54:10.580 --> 54:11.831
Son.

54:14.334 --> 54:15.502
I'm sorry.

54:20.382 --> 54:22.092
For neglecting you

54:23.343 --> 54:24.761
for all those years.

54:25.428 --> 54:26.972
Please run away.

54:32.143 --> 54:33.228
My son.

54:35.105 --> 54:36.398
Run away from here.

54:40.694 --> 54:43.989
And prove that what I saw was wrong.

54:44.072 --> 54:44.990
Son.

54:46.616 --> 54:47.867
Forgive me.

54:48.451 --> 54:50.036
I wished

54:50.912 --> 54:52.998
that you could have

54:55.208 --> 54:56.668
told me just one

55:00.964 --> 55:02.507
that I was wrong.

55:08.054 --> 55:09.806
What I saw didn't happen.

55:10.974 --> 55:11.975
I'm sorry.

55:14.185 --> 55:15.770
I'm really sorry.

55:17.063 --> 55:18.148
What I did

55:19.649 --> 55:21.067
was shameful.

55:23.695 --> 55:25.030
I let you down.

55:29.451 --> 55:30.869
I'm so sorry.

55:49.721 --> 55:52.265
This will never end.

55:55.810 --> 55:58.229
Everyone who sees this.

56:15.747 --> 56:17.499
Whoever sees the video

56:23.713 --> 56:25.381
will die no matter what.

56:33.181 --> 56:35.266
And will kill the person

56:36.768 --> 56:38.019
they love the most.

56:51.783 --> 56:53.034
You've returned.

56:54.410 --> 56:55.411
At last.

57:02.085 --> 57:03.962
We're all sinners.

57:05.964 --> 57:10.009
Sometimes, we question Guru's teachings
and don't understand the true meaning.

57:10.593 --> 57:15.598
Until we reach the new future,
our sins will remain with us forever.

57:17.434 --> 57:19.185
That is why it is absolutely necessary

57:19.936 --> 57:21.729
for us to see the Day of Purification.

57:23.898 --> 57:26.651
Everyone, I have very good news for you.

57:27.610 --> 57:29.529
He has kept his promise.

57:32.574 --> 57:34.117
He will return to us.

57:34.826 --> 57:38.079
The promise he made to us
that he would be with us

57:40.540 --> 57:42.208
in the new future has been kept.

57:49.382 --> 57:51.551
Guru has returned to us.

57:56.222 --> 57:57.765
Now let go of your fear.

58:00.185 --> 58:02.854
Let go of any useless attachment
you have to your present life.

58:10.695 --> 58:13.323
Let us all

58:14.782 --> 58:16.409
welcome him together.

58:25.710 --> 58:26.794
Was it you?

58:29.464 --> 58:31.049
What do you mean?

58:31.132 --> 58:32.300
Did you send

58:34.177 --> 58:35.303
the videotape to her?

58:36.429 --> 58:37.805
No, it's not me.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.683
I wouldn't dare to. You didn't
give me permission either.

58:40.767 --> 58:41.893
I think

58:43.186 --> 58:46.064
Master Jung is behind it.

58:46.940 --> 58:50.151
As the representative,
he's been making his own rules.

58:52.529 --> 58:53.530
What

58:57.200 --> 59:00.495
do you think I know and don't know?

59:01.996 --> 59:02.872
Guru,

59:03.498 --> 59:04.374
I…

59:04.999 --> 59:06.084
What

59:09.712 --> 59:13.341
do you think

59:16.219 --> 59:18.263
I know and don't know?

59:20.473 --> 59:22.934
Do you know why I've kept you alive?

59:25.019 --> 59:28.189
I can clearly see your future.

59:30.358 --> 59:32.193
It's a fitting future for you.

59:39.117 --> 59:41.494
I wasn't thinking about killing you.

59:45.248 --> 59:47.834
But you kept threatening me so…

59:48.918 --> 59:51.963
That I should admit to
what I did at the welfare center.

59:52.046 --> 59:54.799
And accept punishment
for my crimes by confessing.

59:55.466 --> 59:57.218
What's the point of doing that?

59:58.219 --> 1:00:00.972
That's in the past.

1:00:01.681 --> 1:00:05.101
If I go to prison,

1:00:05.184 --> 1:00:07.520
will that bring back those
dead people to life?

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:10.273
Would it?

1:00:11.149 --> 1:00:12.358
Raise your head.

1:00:28.708 --> 1:00:30.168
It's interesting.

1:00:33.755 --> 1:00:37.383
You're someone
who killed his own daughter.

1:00:38.009 --> 1:00:39.719
I'll let you join her.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:49.687
No.

1:00:50.438 --> 1:00:52.523
You could be useful.

1:00:57.362 --> 1:00:59.989
Now answer my question.

1:01:01.199 --> 1:01:03.159
I can erase this memory.

1:01:07.205 --> 1:01:10.041
The memory of you killing your daughter

1:01:12.502 --> 1:01:16.005
with your own two hands.

1:01:17.298 --> 1:01:18.299
You're

1:01:20.760 --> 1:01:22.136
the one who did it,

1:01:23.554 --> 1:01:25.098
The cursed kid.

1:01:25.848 --> 1:01:30.728
You drowned all the people
at the welfare center in the pool.

1:01:30.812 --> 1:01:32.063
Answer me.

1:01:35.817 --> 1:01:37.276
Do you want your memories to be erased?

1:01:38.403 --> 1:01:40.655
Will you become my worker ant?

1:01:50.581 --> 1:01:51.624
Do it.

1:01:54.961 --> 1:01:57.130
Erase my memory.

1:01:58.172 --> 1:02:00.633
So that I can

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:04.220
be reborn with a clean memory.

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:31.307
Grandma…

1:03:40.733 --> 1:03:42.109
Please be reincarnated into

1:03:44.237 --> 1:03:46.948
the future daughter I'll have.

1:03:53.079 --> 1:03:57.166
Then I'll wrap you up in a bundle

1:03:58.751 --> 1:04:00.294
and carry you on my back.

1:04:05.466 --> 1:04:06.717
I'm sorry.

1:04:09.554 --> 1:04:10.763
I'm sorry.

1:04:12.557 --> 1:04:13.975
I'm sorry, Grandma.

1:04:42.461 --> 1:04:44.589
We finished all the preparations.

1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:49.635
It's time to return home.

1:05:06.861 --> 1:05:09.572
She'll learn who she is
when she returns home.

1:05:13.034 --> 1:05:14.827
Who Jo Jae-young is.

1:05:19.081 --> 1:05:20.583
Who her parents are.

1:06:35.783 --> 1:06:37.702
-<i>In return,</i>
-<i>Where is my Auntie?</i>

1:06:37.785 --> 1:06:39.453
promise me that it'll end with me.

1:06:40.913 --> 1:06:44.000
My late wife wrote me a letter?

1:06:44.583 --> 1:06:45.793
What kind of nonsense is this?

1:06:45.876 --> 1:06:49.630
<i>Both sides did cruel things.</i>

1:06:49.714 --> 1:06:51.632
<i>I've waited for this moment my entire life</i>

1:06:51.716 --> 1:06:54.093
even though I feared it.

1:06:55.761 --> 1:06:56.846
I'll get you!

1:06:56.929 --> 1:06:59.432
You can never kill me.

1:07:00.349 --> 1:07:02.643
I'm the only person

1:07:02.727 --> 1:07:04.228
who can end my life.

1:07:06.272 --> 1:07:11.277
