00:42.410 --> 00:44.112
Come on. Come on!

01:18.679 --> 01:19.956
He's coming!

01:19.980 --> 01:21.149
He's coming!

01:28.356 --> 01:29.390
Father.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.425
Jeremy.

01:32.660 --> 01:34.595
Have you come to
pray for me, Father?

01:36.330 --> 01:37.831
God can't help you.

01:45.973 --> 01:47.784
You think you can trap me here?

01:47.808 --> 01:51.087
Deliver this boy from all
sin, from hatred and anger.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.222
What are you doing?

01:52.246 --> 01:54.891
From lightning and tempest,

01:54.915 --> 01:56.850
from plague and
damnation, I deliver you!

01:58.786 --> 01:59.786
Begone, devil!

02:03.557 --> 02:05.535
Tremble under the
powerful hand of God.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.761
Cower in the sight of His glory.

02:15.369 --> 02:18.206
You have no power
over me, old man.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.608
This is sacred ground.

02:21.742 --> 02:24.678
It is you without the power.

02:30.218 --> 02:33.330
Your precious sanctuary
won't save you!

02:33.354 --> 02:35.199
Leave him, unholy one.

02:35.223 --> 02:36.857
Leave with all your wickedness!

02:50.638 --> 02:53.217
Do you renounce the
power of evil?

02:53.241 --> 02:55.209
Father, please have mercy.

02:56.410 --> 02:58.612
Do you renounce the
power of evil?

03:01.349 --> 03:05.619
Do you renounce the
power of evil?

03:08.055 --> 03:09.790
Please don't hurt me, Father.

03:12.159 --> 03:15.529
Do you renounce the
power of evil?

03:17.731 --> 03:18.731
No!

03:30.844 --> 03:36.526
Saint Michael, our Archangel,
defend us in this day of battle.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.887
Be our safeguard against the
wickedness and snares of the devil.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.497
Michael!

04:13.521 --> 04:15.231
Do I have to stay with Sofia?

04:15.255 --> 04:16.535
It's only for a couple of hours.

04:16.559 --> 04:18.302
We won't be long, I promise.

04:18.326 --> 04:19.336
I made you something.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.870
What's this?

04:20.894 --> 04:23.206
It's you getting your award.

04:23.230 --> 04:24.298
Aww...

04:25.366 --> 04:26.400
Thank you, sweetheart.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.472
You haven't seen my brooch
anywhere, have you?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.776
Michael, we're going to be late!

04:36.310 --> 04:37.487
I'm here.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.655
Didn't hear me calling you?

04:38.679 --> 04:40.357
I didn't. I'm sorry.

04:40.381 --> 04:41.615
Hey, what's this?

04:42.983 --> 04:45.395
It's a card. Jacob
made it for me.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.420
I didn't get one?

04:47.220 --> 04:48.340
You're not getting an award.

04:48.633 --> 04:49.633
Touche.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.034
Have a good time.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.258
I'll keep Jacob in line while you're gone.
Right, kiddo?

04:55.028 --> 04:56.430
Your fly.

04:59.232 --> 05:01.845
Will you read me a bedtime
story when you get home?

05:01.869 --> 05:06.683
You mean something like "Wee Willie
Winkie runs through the town?"

05:06.707 --> 05:08.818
"Upstairs, downstairs,
in his nightgown!

05:08.842 --> 05:09.819
Michael. "Tapping
at the window,".

05:09.843 --> 05:11.621
"Crying through the lock."

05:11.645 --> 05:13.957
"Are all the children in their beds?
It's past 8 o'clock"

05:13.981 --> 05:14.981
Michael!

05:20.220 --> 05:21.655
What do you want for dinner?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.334
Ice cream.

05:24.358 --> 05:25.759
Chicken nuggets it is.

05:28.362 --> 05:29.397
What's wrong, boy?

05:41.375 --> 05:42.952
Don't worry.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.016
If we take the freeway, we
should get there in time.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.956
How long has it been going on?

05:46.980 --> 05:48.580
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

05:48.604 --> 05:49.604
Don't.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.562
Rachel, it's a big night.

05:52.586 --> 05:55.064
Whatever it is, I'm sure it can wait.
We need to talk.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.101
Hon, we're gonna be late.
Just answer the question.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.126
How long?

06:00.694 --> 06:03.096
Please, not now. Not tonight.

06:14.174 --> 06:15.685
Oh, my God! Jacob!

06:15.709 --> 06:17.020
He's supposed to
be in the house.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.187
Call 911!

06:18.211 --> 06:19.211
I am, I am.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.289
Yes, I need an
ambulance immediately

06:23.313 --> 06:24.561
to 508 Hapgood Way.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.295
My son's been hit by a car.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.319
He's seven.

06:34.227 --> 06:37.073
He's got difficulty breathing, rapid
heart rate, unstable vital signs.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.743
Tell Dr. Stubeck we've
got a hot unload.

06:39.767 --> 06:41.478
What have we got?
Seven-year-old male.

06:41.502 --> 06:42.512
Possible punctured lung.

06:42.536 --> 06:43.513
Get him on the table.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.248
Get me an amp of epi.

06:45.272 --> 06:46.272
He's going in to V-fib.

06:47.975 --> 06:48.975
He's unstable.

06:51.512 --> 06:52.989
We need to start compressions.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.013
Get me a cart over here!

07:09.096 --> 07:10.176
Where the hell is that epi?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.534
- DR.
- We're losing him.

07:14.568 --> 07:16.212
Losing pulse.

07:16.236 --> 07:17.505
Charging to 120.

07:18.205 --> 07:19.205
Clear.

07:21.374 --> 07:23.086
Get me another amp of epi.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.444
Clear.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.074
Call it.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.212
You're gonna have to say
something eventually.

09:07.648 --> 09:08.749
Rachel?

09:14.788 --> 09:17.691
For crying out loud, we're
coming from our son's funeral.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.292
Please.

09:23.997 --> 09:24.997
Fine.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.100
Michael!

09:28.802 --> 09:30.680
What the hell is the
matter with you?

09:30.704 --> 09:31.824
It just came out of nowhere.

09:31.848 --> 09:33.182
Right!

09:33.206 --> 09:34.784
You know what?

09:34.808 --> 09:36.786
Why don't you just say it?
Say what?

09:36.810 --> 09:38.779
That you blame me for Jacob.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.814
Do you?

09:41.749 --> 09:42.950
It was an accident, Rachel.

09:45.085 --> 09:46.085
Were you drinking?

09:46.920 --> 09:48.798
Is that what you think?

09:48.822 --> 09:52.068
I had one drink that night while
I was getting ready. One.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.738
It's never just one. No,
I wasn't drunk, Rachel!

09:54.762 --> 09:56.196
- Yeah, right.
- Oh, come on!

10:15.749 --> 10:16.860
It's in pain.

10:16.884 --> 10:17.884
Well, call a vet.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.225
Michael, you can't.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.335
We can't just leave it here.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.077
Stay here. I'll be right back.

10:50.884 --> 10:52.052
Can I help you?

10:54.287 --> 10:56.866
Actually, I was hoping
I could help you.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.467
It's been a really bad day.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.936
What's he want?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.362
Would you like to
have your son back?

11:05.699 --> 11:08.244
What did he say?

11:08.268 --> 11:11.080
I asked you if... Yeah.
I heard what you said.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.873
Now I'm asking you to leave.

11:14.407 --> 11:18.278
All I'm asking is that you
promise to protect the boy.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.389
Protect him from what?

11:20.413 --> 11:22.058
Did you hear me?

11:22.082 --> 11:24.127
Small price to pay, isn't it?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.029
For the life of your son?

11:26.053 --> 11:27.630
Okay, that's it. Michael.

11:27.654 --> 11:29.056
Bring the body back here.

11:30.223 --> 11:31.992
I'll take care of
everything else.

11:33.160 --> 11:35.428
Good day to you.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.466
I can't believe you're
even thinking about it.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.269
It came back to life, Michael.

12:50.537 --> 12:51.537
Yes.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.208
But digging up our son's body?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.157
Handing it over
to some stranger?

12:59.012 --> 13:00.247
It's insane.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.658
Yeah, it is.

13:02.682 --> 13:03.851
Thank you.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.920
What have we got to lose?

13:08.488 --> 13:11.200
Listen to yourself!

13:11.224 --> 13:14.170
Are you honestly willing
to go out there right now

13:14.194 --> 13:16.029
and dig up Jacob's grave?

13:17.931 --> 13:20.267
Because I know I'm not.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.275
Get down, get down.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.324
It's clear. Come on.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.393
It's gonna be okay, boy.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.965
What have we done?

15:32.799 --> 15:34.234
Everything we could.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.205
Thanks. For trying.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.123
Wait downstairs.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.969
Bad dream?

17:06.992 --> 17:07.992
Yeah.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.445
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.

17:35.388 --> 17:36.699
What is it, Mommy? What's wrong?

17:36.723 --> 17:38.033
Nothing.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.302
Just so glad to see you.

17:39.326 --> 17:40.936
It's really him.

17:40.960 --> 17:41.904
Of course it is.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.130
It's our son.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.835
What's wrong, boy?

17:57.810 --> 17:58.811
Bruce?

17:59.512 --> 18:00.713
Bruce!

18:23.035 --> 18:24.035
I've had my demons.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.809
I drank, I cheated on my wife.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.844
But...

18:32.945 --> 18:35.023
Three months ago,

18:35.047 --> 18:36.616
I got a second chance.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.720
We moved to a new
town, a new house.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.824
And you know what? We're better.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.829
I'm not drinking anymore.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.167
My wife and I are
closer than ever.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.404
And my son...

19:05.412 --> 19:09.516
I feel like I got
my family back.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.652
You pretending to be asleep?

19:36.676 --> 19:37.953
Nope.

19:37.977 --> 19:40.289
You want to fool around
before he wakes up?

19:40.313 --> 19:42.249
Yep.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.030
Good morning.

19:48.054 --> 19:49.689
Hello to me.

19:53.993 --> 19:56.195
Oh!

19:57.664 --> 19:59.208
Michael. What?

19:59.232 --> 20:00.609
Michael. What?

20:00.633 --> 20:01.444
- He's here.
- Who?

20:01.468 --> 20:02.502
Look.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.090
Huh? Hey. How long you been
standing there, buddy?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.016
I'm hungry.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.184
Can you make pancakes?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.378
Sure. Be right there.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.845
Look at him.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.705
He's like a perfect
little angel.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.085
You know, this is what I
thought it would be like

20:43.109 --> 20:44.711
when we were first married.

20:45.278 --> 20:46.446
Me, too.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.352
Have we unpacked
the spatula yet?

20:52.952 --> 20:53.986
Let me look.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.901
You know, I was thinking.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.327
We should go to church tomorrow.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.462
Church?

21:03.563 --> 21:04.873
Yeah, why not?

21:04.897 --> 21:06.833
Got a new name, new
house, new car.

21:09.569 --> 21:10.903
New beginnings.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.706
Sounds perfect.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.820
Me like mine with blueberries.

21:17.844 --> 21:19.646
So demanding.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.686
Tell Jacob breakfast
is almost ready. Okay.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.291
Jacob!

21:56.315 --> 21:58.050
Mom says breakfast
is almost ready.

22:01.954 --> 22:02.954
Jacob?

22:03.990 --> 22:05.057
You out here?

22:08.828 --> 22:09.828
Jacob!

22:11.097 --> 22:12.097
Boo!

22:13.400 --> 22:16.144
Gotcha.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.414
Come on, it's time to get
in the house for breakfast.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.506
Okay.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.881
"Wee Willie Winkie runs
through the town."

22:52.905 --> 22:56.452
"Upstairs, downstairs,
in his nightgown."

22:56.476 --> 22:59.655
"Tapping at the window
Crying through the lock."

22:59.679 --> 23:02.615
"Are all the kids in their beds?
It's past 8 o'clock."

23:03.616 --> 23:06.094
I know I'm not like other kids.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.196
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to do.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.823
I feel different sometimes.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.637
You make me feel better.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.272
You always were a
good mother, Rachel.

23:17.296 --> 23:18.798
Sorry, were you talking to me?

23:22.334 --> 23:23.979
Is something wrong, Daddy?

23:24.003 --> 23:26.515
Who were you talking to? Myself.

23:26.539 --> 23:27.779
I saw someone in here with you.

23:29.642 --> 23:30.877
There's no one here.

23:32.812 --> 23:33.812
Michael?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.549
There was someone here.

24:13.019 --> 24:14.663
I swear I saw something.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.188
Hasn't he been through enough?

24:17.389 --> 24:18.701
I'm not making this up.

24:18.725 --> 24:20.435
What's going on
with you, Michael?

24:20.459 --> 24:21.570
Let's talk about this.

24:21.594 --> 24:22.895
There's nothing to talk about.

24:29.502 --> 24:31.203
There. They're gone now.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.540
So, where were we?

24:45.051 --> 24:48.487
The devil, Satan,
Lucifer, Beelzebub.

24:49.656 --> 24:53.092
Often symbolic of man's
fall from grace.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.864
The Bible calls him
by many names.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.536
How can one not realize

25:05.938 --> 25:09.275
that not only is the devil
real, but he is thriving?

25:11.343 --> 25:14.847
Strife in the Middle
East, disease in Africa,

25:16.248 --> 25:18.718
families being washed
away by floods.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.622
His influence can
be felt everywhere,

25:24.456 --> 25:28.227
constantly tempting all of
humanity to betray one another

25:30.630 --> 25:31.931
to commit sin.

25:37.169 --> 25:40.306
As Jesus said in 1
John, chapter 3.

25:42.508 --> 25:44.310
"Let no one be led astray."

25:46.846 --> 25:49.048
"The one who sins
is of the devil."

25:52.151 --> 25:55.221
"That is how we know who
the children of God are"

25:56.856 --> 25:59.158
"and who are the
children of the devil."

26:01.794 --> 26:02.938
Jacob? Jacob, are you okay?

26:02.962 --> 26:04.139
Michael, what's wrong?

26:04.163 --> 26:05.163
You're the doctor.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.634
"Anyone..."

26:09.235 --> 26:10.637
"Anyone who does not..."

26:14.373 --> 26:17.786
"Any... Anyone who does not
know what right is..."

26:17.810 --> 26:19.779
Is it a seizure? I don't know.

26:21.547 --> 26:24.183
You have... You have to rid
yourself of the devil!

26:26.052 --> 26:28.396
"Anyone who does not
know what is right..."

26:28.420 --> 26:29.632
Jacob!

26:29.656 --> 26:30.790
"Is not God's child!"

26:41.300 --> 26:42.540
We need to get him out of here!

26:49.976 --> 26:50.976
Go.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.731
What's wrong with him?

27:02.755 --> 27:03.923
I have no idea.

27:05.524 --> 27:06.902
Put me down!

27:06.926 --> 27:08.671
Get the car. Get the door.
Let go of me!

27:08.695 --> 27:10.096
Stop it!

27:10.797 --> 27:12.440
Ah! Jacob!

27:12.464 --> 27:13.942
Let me see. Michael!

27:13.966 --> 27:15.802
It's fine. Let's just go.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.512
Father, are you okay?
Are you hurt?

27:50.536 --> 27:51.771
What was that?

27:56.776 --> 27:58.310
That was a warning.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.925
Hey, it's not your fault.

28:49.528 --> 28:50.839
You tried to save him.

28:50.863 --> 28:52.331
You were the only one.

28:54.633 --> 28:57.179
Look, I know you've been
trying really hard.

28:57.203 --> 28:59.806
You have us. Isn't that
what really matters?

29:02.274 --> 29:03.442
I'll be fine.

29:18.524 --> 29:19.524
Hey!

30:20.286 --> 30:21.954
Why were you watching me?

30:23.055 --> 30:24.556
Please take a seat, Mr. Young.

30:33.866 --> 30:36.778
How'd you know that name?

30:36.802 --> 30:41.040
I know a lot of things about
you, your wife, your son.

30:45.777 --> 30:47.777
You're probably thinking
you made a mistake, right?

30:50.216 --> 30:52.051
Are you a man of faith, Michael?

30:54.020 --> 30:55.521
Occasionally.

30:57.623 --> 31:01.436
Well, when you've seen the things I
have, you realize that a crucifix

31:01.460 --> 31:03.906
is just two pieces
of crossed wood.

31:03.930 --> 31:05.197
Holy water,

31:06.665 --> 31:08.034
regular H2O.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.172
The real power

31:15.541 --> 31:16.541
is in the devil.

31:18.044 --> 31:20.788
What if I told you
he could be reborn?

31:20.812 --> 31:23.249
If the right opportunity
presented itself.

31:25.217 --> 31:28.730
Like a recently
deceased young boy?

31:28.754 --> 31:31.099
Two loving, desperate
parents willing

31:31.123 --> 31:33.701
to do anything to
get their son back?

31:33.725 --> 31:38.030
Are you suggesting the devil is
responsible for bringing my son back?

31:39.999 --> 31:42.945
I'm suggesting that
the son you got back

31:42.969 --> 31:44.370
is the devil.

31:50.076 --> 31:51.876
This is a mistake. I
shouldn't have come here.

31:51.900 --> 31:54.089
So a complete stranger
pops out of nowhere

31:54.113 --> 31:56.858
and offers to bring your
son back from the dead?

31:56.882 --> 31:57.882
Come on.

31:58.985 --> 32:01.263
You don't find
that a little odd?

32:01.287 --> 32:04.599
You don't see the catch?

32:04.623 --> 32:07.263
You think what happened at the
church this morning was an accident?

32:13.799 --> 32:15.801
You think Jacob had
something to do with that?

32:17.269 --> 32:18.780
As long as that boy lives...

32:18.804 --> 32:19.948
What do you mean "lives"?

32:19.972 --> 32:22.450
Not you, not your wife,

32:22.474 --> 32:25.320
not anyone you care
or love will be safe.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.689
This is my son we're
talking about.

32:27.713 --> 32:28.713
It is not your son!

32:42.761 --> 32:43.761
What's this?

32:47.933 --> 32:49.744
He was barely 10-years-old

32:49.768 --> 32:52.008
the day he chased his ball
into the middle of the street.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.174
I ran after him, but
it was too late.

32:57.309 --> 33:00.422
He was hit by a van.
He died instantly.

33:00.446 --> 33:03.725
The next day, a man came
to visit his mother and I.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.184
This is your son?

33:06.218 --> 33:08.863
He offered us a chance to...

33:08.887 --> 33:10.389
To bring Jeremy back.

33:12.458 --> 33:15.227
But it didn't take
long for me to realize

33:16.162 --> 33:18.064
that it wasn't Jeremy.

33:19.398 --> 33:24.036
It was something else.
He'd become something.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.814
I don't know. I got lost.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.208
I was struggling for an answer.
I was scared.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.579
So I joined the church.

33:35.013 --> 33:36.558
And the Lord...

33:36.582 --> 33:38.893
The Lord showed me
what had to be done.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.795
You did this?

33:40.819 --> 33:42.630
I did what I had to do.

33:42.654 --> 33:45.724
You killed your son. No, I killed
the devil who looked like my son.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.696
Jacob has to be stopped
at all costs, Mr. Young.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.042
And only the boy's
father can do it.

33:54.066 --> 33:56.368
Only you can stop Jacob
before it's too late.

33:57.103 --> 33:59.781
You are out of your mind!

33:59.805 --> 34:02.317
I understand what
you're going through.

34:02.341 --> 34:04.086
It'll only get worse,
I promise you.

34:04.110 --> 34:05.777
If Jacob matures,

34:09.181 --> 34:10.315
God help us all.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.120
For your coffee.

34:26.732 --> 34:27.732
Jacob?

34:41.280 --> 34:42.414
Jacob?

35:19.718 --> 35:20.718
Jacob?

35:46.545 --> 35:50.416
"Tapping at the window And
crying through the lock."

35:52.251 --> 35:54.520
"Are all the children
in their beds?"

35:55.454 --> 35:57.323
"It's past 8 o'clock."

36:09.000 --> 36:11.112
I... I have to go. I'm sorry.

36:11.136 --> 36:12.180
What the hell, man? Hey!

36:12.204 --> 36:13.505
What are you doing?

36:19.077 --> 36:20.622
Hey, hey, hey.

36:20.646 --> 36:22.557
Hey. Say hi to Mom. Say hello.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.115
Hi, Mommy! Hi.

36:25.484 --> 36:26.752
Hu.

36:29.455 --> 36:30.656
Go on, go on. Good!

37:20.171 --> 37:21.483
What are you doing out here?

37:21.507 --> 37:23.318
Oh, I was, uh...

37:23.342 --> 37:26.421
I was just on my phone.

37:26.445 --> 37:27.605
Can we have pizza for dinner?

37:28.146 --> 37:29.281
Sure, yeah.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.723
I can't believe he did that.

37:38.223 --> 37:40.802
What did he say?

37:40.826 --> 37:43.671
He just wanted to make
sure Jacob was okay.

37:43.695 --> 37:45.507
And what did you tell him?

37:45.531 --> 37:48.042
I don't know. I...

37:48.066 --> 37:52.046
I mean, last night in the
room, and then the church.

37:52.070 --> 37:56.618
You have to admit, he hasn't been
the same since he came back.

37:56.642 --> 37:57.985
I can hardly blame him

37:58.009 --> 37:59.554
after everything
he's been through.

37:59.578 --> 38:02.590
I knew things would be
different for a while,

38:02.614 --> 38:04.416
but these last couple days...

38:07.085 --> 38:08.896
Maybe we should take
Jacob to a specialist.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.065
You mean a shrink? No, I
mean someone to talk to.

38:11.089 --> 38:14.936
Someone who can tell us if there's,
you know, something wrong.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.796
What happens when the specialist
figures out who he is?

38:18.797 --> 38:20.766
Fifty people at his funeral.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.677
We had to leave everything

38:22.701 --> 38:24.546
and everyone behind. I know.

38:24.570 --> 38:27.214
We have a new life, a new home.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.384
Can't just keep running.

38:29.408 --> 38:31.377
We promised to protect him.

38:32.177 --> 38:33.311
I know.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.992
I thought you were doing better.

38:38.016 --> 38:40.362
I thought the meetings
were helping.

38:40.386 --> 38:42.397
What does that have
to do with anything?

38:42.421 --> 38:44.265
You know exactly what
I'm talking about.

38:44.289 --> 38:45.791
You weren't exactly
there for him.

38:46.992 --> 38:47.993
Or me.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.941
We were having trouble.

38:53.965 --> 38:56.101
Our marriage was falling apart.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.540
And we're better now. Huh?

39:02.307 --> 39:05.252
I'm better now.

39:05.276 --> 39:08.414
But what's happening with
Jacob, this is something else.

39:12.150 --> 39:14.396
Jacob, honey?

39:14.420 --> 39:16.688
How long have you
been standing there?

39:17.456 --> 39:19.967
Daddy?

39:19.991 --> 39:21.560
Why did you kill me?

39:26.632 --> 39:27.766
Don't.

39:38.810 --> 39:40.888
How's he doing this morning?

39:40.912 --> 39:42.890
Better.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.326
We're going to the park later.
You want to come?

39:45.350 --> 39:47.462
I think I'm gonna hit up
a couple temp agencies.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.830
Mind if I take the car? No.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.197
I could use the fresh air.

39:50.221 --> 39:51.221
Go get 'em.

39:52.891 --> 39:53.891
I will.

39:56.562 --> 39:57.763
Bye, Jacob.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.176
How come Daddy didn't come?

41:09.200 --> 41:10.612
He had an interview.

41:10.636 --> 41:11.846
Is he getting a job?

41:11.870 --> 41:13.071
I certainly hope so.

41:17.676 --> 41:18.986
Can we get a cat?

41:19.010 --> 41:20.010
No, honey.

41:22.548 --> 41:23.858
How come?

41:23.882 --> 41:25.551
Your father's allergic.
You know that.

41:26.852 --> 41:28.887
Can we get one when Daddy dies?

41:31.022 --> 41:32.022
Mrs. Field.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.539
You go ahead and play.
Mommy will be right there.

41:37.563 --> 41:38.930
Okay. I'll hold that.

41:46.672 --> 41:49.216
How'd you find us?

41:49.240 --> 41:51.218
Don't be alarmed.

41:51.242 --> 41:53.879
I just wanted to see how
things were coming along.

41:57.382 --> 41:59.918
What a fine, young,
handsome boy.

42:01.386 --> 42:02.654
So innocent.

42:03.822 --> 42:04.822
Pure.

42:05.991 --> 42:08.302
My husband's
concerned about him.

42:08.326 --> 42:10.805
Thinks we should take him
to see a specialist.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.840
What do you think?

42:12.864 --> 42:14.566
He's a seven-year-old boy.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.670
Moved to a new home,
a strange new town.

42:20.471 --> 42:22.551
I'd be alarmed if he wasn't
feeling a little awkward.

42:24.442 --> 42:26.311
Well, Jacob's an
extraordinary child.

42:27.779 --> 42:29.791
As with many
extraordinary children,

42:29.815 --> 42:33.184
you'll find that some people take
an unusual interest in them.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.021
You mean hurt him?

42:37.856 --> 42:40.692
You have to remember,
Rachel, Jacob is a miracle.

42:42.560 --> 42:45.964
He needs your love and devotion
if he's to live a normal life.

42:52.203 --> 42:54.773
Promise me you'll
continue to protect him.

42:55.907 --> 42:57.075
Of course. At all costs.

42:59.544 --> 43:02.213
Even from those who
are close to him.

43:06.251 --> 43:07.285
I promise.

43:08.486 --> 43:10.765
I'm gonna give you an address.

43:10.789 --> 43:14.760
If things become difficult, you
and Jacob will always be welcome.

43:21.667 --> 43:23.334
Jacob? Jacob?

43:24.569 --> 43:25.569
Jacob?

43:34.545 --> 43:35.613
Oh...

43:57.135 --> 43:59.380
Hey, what do you think you're doing?
I was waiting.

43:59.404 --> 44:01.615
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?

44:01.639 --> 44:03.651
Yeah, we don't want you here.
Get lost.

44:03.675 --> 44:05.310
Leave me alone.

44:10.716 --> 44:12.150
Ugh.

44:28.767 --> 44:31.136
That's right, go home
to Mommy and cry.

44:50.688 --> 44:52.991
What's going on?
Is he doing that?

45:01.733 --> 45:04.469
You've got to be kidding me.

45:06.571 --> 45:07.971
What the hell is
going on out there?

45:12.543 --> 45:15.256
We were just kidding.
We didn't mean it.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.000
I think we better get out of here.
Let's go.

45:25.423 --> 45:27.334
Can anybody hear me?

45:27.358 --> 45:28.994
Hello?

45:49.647 --> 45:51.358
Please!

45:51.382 --> 45:52.382
Somebody, help me!

46:11.970 --> 46:13.238
Open! Please!

46:14.172 --> 46:15.172
Somebody, help me!

46:24.549 --> 46:25.550
Go, go, go.

46:26.417 --> 46:27.417
Run home.

46:41.032 --> 46:43.034
Jacob? Jacob?

46:51.609 --> 46:52.878
Here, Mommy.

46:53.611 --> 46:54.611
Jacob.

47:05.390 --> 47:07.401
Hey.

47:07.425 --> 47:08.705
I just heard about
what happened.

47:10.195 --> 47:13.007
Are you okay? Yeah, we're
just a bit shaken up.

47:13.031 --> 47:15.671
They said a number of people were
brought in to the emergency room,

47:15.695 --> 47:17.411
but nobody seems to
know what caused it.

47:17.435 --> 47:20.414
Well, the news is calling it some
kind of freak weather thing.

47:20.438 --> 47:21.448
We got lucky.

47:21.472 --> 47:23.117
Mmm-hmm.

47:23.141 --> 47:24.475
I'm just glad you both are okay.

47:26.211 --> 47:28.755
Hey, what do you say we get
some pizza on the way home.

47:28.779 --> 47:30.624
Would you like that? Sure.

47:30.648 --> 47:31.648
Come on.

47:50.801 --> 47:51.903
Jacob.

47:53.704 --> 47:55.549
Time for bed.

47:55.573 --> 47:57.142
Make sure he brushes
his teeth, too.

47:59.577 --> 48:03.481
You hear that? Mommy says it's
time to brush your teeth.

48:13.224 --> 48:14.292
Jacob?

48:17.895 --> 48:19.097
Jacob?

48:20.765 --> 48:22.000
Are you here?

48:42.887 --> 48:43.955
What is it?

48:45.190 --> 48:47.301
Have you seen Jacob?

48:47.325 --> 48:49.045
Not since earlier. I
thought he was in here.

48:51.396 --> 48:53.398
Oh, my God. Jacob.

49:01.072 --> 49:02.974
Jacob? Jacob?

49:04.642 --> 49:06.144
He couldn't have gotten far.
Come on.

49:11.649 --> 49:12.649
Hello?

49:59.264 --> 50:01.032
Such a shame about Jeremy.

50:03.934 --> 50:06.071
I don't think I got a chance
to offer my condolences.

50:08.739 --> 50:09.739
Tell me, Father...

50:11.409 --> 50:16.990
What was it like to bring that
blade down on your own son's neck?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.416
He wasn't my son.

50:36.234 --> 50:38.636
Father, you're
losing your touch.

50:39.604 --> 50:40.604
Such a pity.

51:13.971 --> 51:16.217
I'm not gonna let
you do what you did

51:16.241 --> 51:18.952
to my son and I, to anyone else.

51:18.976 --> 51:21.522
I gave him a little life. You
turned him into a monster.

51:21.546 --> 51:26.627
Well, one man's monster
is another man's God.

51:26.651 --> 51:27.885
Yeah, but my God will win.

51:31.989 --> 51:36.337
AND THE DEVIL WHO HAD
DECEIVED THEM...

51:36.361 --> 51:40.107
WAS THROWN INTO THE LAKE...

51:40.131 --> 51:43.477
OF FIRE AND SULFUR...

51:43.501 --> 51:48.415
WHERE THE BEAST AND
FALSE PROPHET WERE...

51:48.439 --> 51:52.210
AND WHERE THEY WILL
BE TORMENTED...

51:53.878 --> 51:55.256
DAY!

51:55.280 --> 51:56.280
AND NIGHT!

51:56.681 --> 51:57.681
FOREVER!

52:00.385 --> 52:02.753
Good-bye, Vetus Amicus.

52:10.595 --> 52:12.763
So filled with anger,

52:14.299 --> 52:17.302
consumed with vengeance you could
smell, but you couldn't taste.

52:20.638 --> 52:23.408
Tell me, old friend.

52:24.842 --> 52:25.842
Hmm?

52:27.578 --> 52:29.146
Where's your God now?

52:38.356 --> 52:40.491
Oh, so much suffering. Hmm?

52:42.760 --> 52:46.297
What kind of a God would
let his child endure it?

52:59.644 --> 53:02.313
Did your son cry out for mercy
before you cut his head off?

53:03.648 --> 53:05.383
Perhaps he's watching now.

53:06.451 --> 53:07.852
I wonder whose side he's on.

53:09.620 --> 53:10.755
Jacob.

53:27.037 --> 53:28.037
Jacob?

53:30.241 --> 53:31.276
Jacob?

53:33.444 --> 53:34.512
Jacob?

53:34.979 --> 53:36.347
Jacob?

53:38.249 --> 53:39.250
Come on.

53:51.396 --> 53:52.797
He's getting stronger, isn't he?

53:54.799 --> 53:55.799
He's the one.

53:57.968 --> 53:58.968
I feel it.

54:00.004 --> 54:01.004
Jacob?

54:01.772 --> 54:02.772
Jacob?

54:03.574 --> 54:04.574
Daddy? Oh, my God.

54:05.009 --> 54:06.009
Mommy?

54:16.854 --> 54:18.589
I'm ready to come home now.

54:21.191 --> 54:22.427
I think we'd better go.

54:37.141 --> 54:39.219
Now, you can't just
run off like that.

54:39.243 --> 54:40.483
You understand that, don't you?

54:41.078 --> 54:42.078
Jacob?

54:44.715 --> 54:45.983
I understand, Mommy.

54:49.920 --> 54:50.920
Michael?

54:52.423 --> 54:53.491
Michael?

54:56.727 --> 54:58.028
There's something I need to do.

56:48.591 --> 56:50.751
"The Discipuli is a secret
society of wealthy noblemen"

56:50.775 --> 56:52.477
"dating back to
17th-century Rome."

56:54.062 --> 56:56.222
"They dedicated their lives
to manipulating bloodlines"

56:56.246 --> 56:59.016
"in order to give birth
to a true Antichrist,."

57:00.618 --> 57:04.631
"Satan himself reborn
in human form.

57:04.655 --> 57:05.832
"The Discipuli believed"

57:05.856 --> 57:06.833
"that the birth and
rise of Satan"

57:06.857 --> 57:09.202
"would usher in a new age,"

57:09.226 --> 57:12.797
"in which they could achieve
limitless power and wealth."

57:15.099 --> 57:16.200
Oh, my God.

57:28.579 --> 57:29.579
Father Francis?

57:30.648 --> 57:32.149
Yeah, he was in room 156.

57:41.325 --> 57:42.627
Hey, what are you doing here?

57:47.397 --> 57:50.176
Officer? Officers?

57:50.200 --> 57:51.936
Officer, you need to
talk to this guy.

58:02.980 --> 58:05.492
"After initial efforts failed,
the Discipuli realized"

58:05.516 --> 58:07.596
"that their young subjects
must be offered willingly"

58:07.620 --> 58:08.921
"by their parents
as sacrifices."

58:10.846 --> 58:12.966
"The children would become a
vessel for the Antichrist"

58:12.990 --> 58:14.030
"until reaching maturity,"

58:15.292 --> 58:16.837
"at which point their
real potential,"

58:16.861 --> 58:18.141
"the devil within, will awaken."

58:21.231 --> 58:23.109
What are you doing?
You scared me.

58:23.133 --> 58:25.011
I scared you?

58:25.035 --> 58:27.404
What the hell is going on, Michael?
Nothing.

58:29.173 --> 58:30.875
Is this about what
the priest told you?

58:32.643 --> 58:34.579
Where were you tonight?
It doesn't matter.

58:40.084 --> 58:42.519
Look, I've been thinking.
We should leave.

58:44.789 --> 58:46.624
What? Everything that's
happened tonight...

58:47.324 --> 58:48.902
This week...

58:48.926 --> 58:50.971
We should leave
town for a while.

58:50.995 --> 58:52.930
For Jacob. For... for Jacob?

58:54.699 --> 58:57.602
And where would you
like to go, exactly?

58:59.570 --> 59:00.570
Here.

59:01.672 --> 59:03.040
What's this? It's an address.

59:05.209 --> 59:08.454
The Stranger gave it to me.
The Stranger? When?

59:08.478 --> 59:11.324
At the park, he said
we'd be safe there.

59:11.348 --> 59:14.227
What do you mean, safe? We
promised to protect Jacob.

59:14.251 --> 59:16.797
You remember? Yeah.

59:16.821 --> 59:19.941
You remember what he said? We can't allow
anything to happen to him at any cost.

59:22.459 --> 59:23.794
And he's our son.

59:25.129 --> 59:26.673
Right.

59:26.697 --> 59:28.599
So what's the problem?

59:34.872 --> 59:36.850
You're probably right.

59:36.874 --> 59:39.394
Why don't you put a bag together,
and I'll finish up here, okay?

59:39.610 --> 59:41.187
Really? Yeah.

59:41.211 --> 59:42.211
Okay.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.606
You okay?

01:00:10.808 --> 01:00:12.109
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:16.156
Why don't you go in and get some
snacks for the road while I fill up?

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.214
Good idea.

01:00:17.915 --> 01:00:18.949
I'll be right back.

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:20.718
We'll be here.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:46.036
Quiet tonight, huh?

01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:04.121
Thanks.

01:02:11.361 --> 01:02:12.361
Have a good one.

01:02:23.808 --> 01:02:24.809
I'm sorry.

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:36.729
What happened? My God,
we have to save him.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.498
No, no, no. Don't.
Get off of me!

01:02:38.522 --> 01:02:41.225
Rachel. Help me. There's
a child in the car!

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:44.361
He's your son! No, he's not!

01:02:52.837 --> 01:02:54.004
Jacob!

01:03:11.388 --> 01:03:12.388
It can't be.

01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:16.093
Rachel. Rachel, no. Jacob.

01:03:19.763 --> 01:03:21.174
How could you do this?

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:22.833
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel, please.

01:03:42.352 --> 01:03:43.592
Have you found my wife and son?

01:03:46.256 --> 01:03:48.668
We'll get to that, Mr. Field.

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:51.838
No, you don't understand.
You have to find them.

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:54.164
You know how many murders we
had in this town last year?

01:03:55.099 --> 01:03:56.466
Go on, go ahead, guess.

01:03:58.035 --> 01:03:59.336
We're wasting time. None.

01:04:02.672 --> 01:04:04.472
You know how many we had
the year before that?

01:04:06.911 --> 01:04:08.012
None?

01:04:10.314 --> 01:04:11.594
Smarter than you look, Mr.
Field.

01:04:15.219 --> 01:04:16.320
Do you know this man?

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.700
No.

01:04:20.724 --> 01:04:22.468
That's funny, 'cause I
got three witnesses

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:25.062
that put you in his hotel room
hours after the time of his death.

01:04:28.765 --> 01:04:29.934
We'll get back to him.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:33.802
How about this man?

01:04:39.977 --> 01:04:41.078
It's that...

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:43.132
That priest from the church.

01:04:44.306 --> 01:04:46.026
Now, the witnesses say
you were the only one

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.761
that went up there and
tried to help him.

01:04:48.785 --> 01:04:51.464
In fact, you were the one that
actually put out the flames.

01:04:51.488 --> 01:04:52.488
Is that true?

01:04:53.290 --> 01:04:54.290
Yes.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:58.571
Okay, well, here's my problem.

01:04:58.595 --> 01:05:00.740
I haven't had a murder in
this town in two years.

01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:02.308
Now I got two dead priests,

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:04.252
and the only connection
between them both is you.

01:05:09.406 --> 01:05:10.846
Are you sure you
don't know this man?

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:20.860
Father Francis and I met up at a
restaurant a couple days ago.

01:05:20.884 --> 01:05:23.420
I was having family issues.

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:26.366
He said he wanted to help.

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:29.093
Now, if you could just help
me find my wife and son.

01:05:32.762 --> 01:05:35.165
Wait. What's going on?
What are you doing?

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:38.801
What's going on?

01:05:40.204 --> 01:05:41.538
Too many eyes and ears.

01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:48.112
Here's the truth.

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:51.791
I've been following Father
Francis for a while now,

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:53.855
ever since he fled the city
after murdering his son.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:56.963
That's not exactly
what happened.

01:05:56.987 --> 01:05:58.288
I know about the Discipuli cult.

01:05:59.789 --> 01:06:01.591
I know that Father Francis
was following them.

01:06:03.393 --> 01:06:05.938
Children rising from the grave,

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:08.332
death and destruction following
them wherever they go.

01:06:13.537 --> 01:06:15.948
Six victims succumbed
to their injuries

01:06:15.972 --> 01:06:17.583
just this afternoon.

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:18.847
If you knew it was happening...

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.421
Why didn't you do
something about it?

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:23.113
I told you, lots
of eyes and ears.

01:06:24.381 --> 01:06:26.993
We're talking about a
secret society here.

01:06:27.017 --> 01:06:28.537
It's been around for
hundreds of years.

01:06:29.386 --> 01:06:31.055
That's a hell of a
lot of influence.

01:06:31.921 --> 01:06:33.423
What I need is an active case.

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:39.305
You're talking about Jacob.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:40.809
Do you happen to know
where they went?

01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:45.045
They gave my wife an address.

01:06:45.069 --> 01:06:46.349
Can you write that down, please?

01:06:47.071 --> 01:06:48.272
No, I don't need to.

01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:51.751
I'm going.

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:53.953
You're the prime suspect in
an attempted murder case.

01:06:53.977 --> 01:06:55.679
You're not going anywhere.
I don't care.

01:06:57.481 --> 01:07:00.184
You can cuff me, shackle
me, do what you want.

01:07:01.151 --> 01:07:02.352
But I'm going with you.

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.351
Hello?

01:07:43.093 --> 01:07:44.361
Is there anybody here?

01:07:53.036 --> 01:07:54.070
Welcome.

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:57.541
I'm glad to see you.

01:08:00.844 --> 01:08:01.844
What is this place?

01:08:02.946 --> 01:08:04.248
Someplace safe.

01:08:05.482 --> 01:08:06.483
Do come.

01:08:15.492 --> 01:08:17.794
Please, make yourselves at home.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:19.828
After all,

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.435
it's been put here for you.

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:29.538
Quite the collection.

01:08:30.874 --> 01:08:35.154
Oh, reminders of a rich
and storied history.

01:08:35.179 --> 01:08:38.548
You know, we've been waiting
for this a long time.

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:43.229
I want you to know how
dedicated we all are

01:08:43.252 --> 01:08:45.389
to seeing you reach
your full potential.

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:48.134
What potential is that?

01:08:48.158 --> 01:08:50.303
Oh, don't be concerned, Rachel.

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:52.395
You and your son
will be safe here.

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:54.531
Is he my son?

01:08:55.899 --> 01:08:57.810
Even if he weren't,

01:08:57.834 --> 01:09:01.871
would he be less deserving
of your love, nurture, care?

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:05.875
Every boy deserves a mother.

01:09:21.024 --> 01:09:23.727
Your husband's arrived, and
he's brought some friends.

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:27.309
I'm gonna need you to stay here.

01:09:27.332 --> 01:09:28.808
You can't leave me.

01:09:28.832 --> 01:09:30.734
If your wife and son are
here, we'll find 'em.

01:09:40.577 --> 01:09:41.944
You... you don't understand.

01:09:42.912 --> 01:09:43.912
It's being handled.

01:09:45.415 --> 01:09:46.959
No. Hey!

01:09:46.983 --> 01:09:47.983
Hey!

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:50.420
Jacob.

01:09:53.756 --> 01:09:55.401
There's a threat.

01:09:55.425 --> 01:09:56.793
We need to move
to the next step.

01:09:57.461 --> 01:09:58.461
Can you do it?

01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:01.197
Good boy.

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:16.531
It's police. We have a warrant
to search the premises.

01:10:16.555 --> 01:10:17.589
Open up.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.365
Jacob.

01:10:38.768 --> 01:10:41.405
Jacob? What's he doing?
What's going on?

01:10:57.220 --> 01:10:58.540
What's happening?
What's he doing?

01:10:58.564 --> 01:10:59.798
Doing what needs to be done.

01:11:28.385 --> 01:11:30.029
You have to stop him.

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:31.431
We can't let them hurt the boy.

01:11:31.455 --> 01:11:32.656
But he's killing them.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:34.790
Jacob?

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:44.833
Larson.

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.881
Get me out of here!

01:11:48.905 --> 01:11:49.905
Let me out! Open the door!

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:51.575
Open the door.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:56.346
Please, move!

01:12:05.088 --> 01:12:06.088
Here, here.

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:09.993
Come on.

01:12:17.501 --> 01:12:19.369
Okay, Mr. Young.

01:12:21.004 --> 01:12:22.406
What now? Now?

01:12:23.407 --> 01:12:24.674
We find my son. Come on.

01:12:59.976 --> 01:13:00.977
Come on.

01:13:29.639 --> 01:13:30.807
We're all clear.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:34.386
What?

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:35.445
Thought I saw something.

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.151
He's toying with us.

01:13:44.287 --> 01:13:46.167
Might be the Antichrist,
but he's still a child.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.164
I think it's time we give that
son of a bitch a time-out.

01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.562
Yeah, come on.

01:14:08.612 --> 01:14:09.679
He's got to be up here.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.482
Come on.

01:14:33.903 --> 01:14:34.938
Jacob?

01:14:37.173 --> 01:14:38.173
Rachel?

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.481
I know you're in here.

01:14:53.356 --> 01:14:54.624
Show yourself.

01:14:58.728 --> 01:14:59.829
Hide-and-seek?

01:15:00.463 --> 01:15:01.497
Great.

01:15:21.417 --> 01:15:22.552
Let's play, Daddy.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:26.556
Okay.

01:15:28.524 --> 01:15:31.561
My friend, he'd
like to play, too.

01:15:33.396 --> 01:15:34.396
Is that okay?

01:15:35.632 --> 01:15:36.733
Sure.

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:40.303
What are we gonna play?

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.306
How about we play...

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:47.577
Dead.

01:15:54.618 --> 01:15:56.729
Jacob, stop.

01:15:56.753 --> 01:15:58.433
You stop that this
instant, you understand?

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:02.058
It's your choice.

01:16:21.310 --> 01:16:22.311
Look out.

01:16:30.787 --> 01:16:32.121
You know what needs to be done.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.443
He's the only one
standing in your way.

01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:44.801
Please, don't hurt him.

01:16:47.704 --> 01:16:49.038
I know you're not my son.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:54.108
But I also know there's still
part of him in there somewhere.

01:16:58.748 --> 01:16:59.849
I'm sorry...

01:17:01.718 --> 01:17:03.687
For everything I've done
to you and your mother.

01:17:06.522 --> 01:17:07.957
I'm so, so sorry.

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:11.126
But you don't have to do this.

01:17:12.662 --> 01:17:14.063
We can end this
nightmare right now.

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:16.299
All you have to do

01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.634
is come with us.

01:17:25.742 --> 01:17:26.843
Please.

01:17:30.446 --> 01:17:31.446
You're lying.

01:17:44.694 --> 01:17:46.095
Please.

01:17:49.232 --> 01:17:50.232
Finish him.

01:17:59.242 --> 01:18:00.276
Oh, honey.

01:18:02.578 --> 01:18:04.413
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be...

01:18:07.216 --> 01:18:09.016
We've got to go. We've
got to get out of here.

01:18:25.769 --> 01:18:26.769
Come on.

01:18:39.148 --> 01:18:40.148
Run.

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:42.285
Come on.

01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:53.806
Okay, baby, gonna get
you to a hospital.

01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:54.831
Okay.

01:19:06.776 --> 01:19:08.812
Faster. Go faster. I'm trying.

01:19:17.053 --> 01:19:19.064
Get off the road now.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.957
Just get to the house. Okay.

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:37.807
- What are they waiting for?
- I don't know.

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:39.976
Come on. Wait.

01:20:04.934 --> 01:20:06.802
Upstairs, now. Now.

01:20:15.811 --> 01:20:19.182
Mommy? Daddy? I'm home.

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:39.568
Where are you, Father?

01:21:15.038 --> 01:21:17.582
You think you can defeat me?

01:21:17.606 --> 01:21:21.277
You think you have
power over me?

01:21:22.145 --> 01:21:23.879
I'm the Father now.

01:21:30.353 --> 01:21:33.966
I am the Father, the Son.

01:21:33.990 --> 01:21:36.159
I am the unholy trinity.

01:21:47.036 --> 01:21:49.348
You should know, Daddy,

01:21:49.372 --> 01:21:51.340
this is all your fault.

01:22:00.984 --> 01:22:02.351
Are you okay?

01:22:04.753 --> 01:22:06.298
It has to be me.

01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:08.233
Wh... What you mean?

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:09.537
I have to do it.
It has to be me.

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:06.649
Go to hell.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:09.221
Try to take it easy for
a couple of days, okay?

01:24:09.245 --> 01:24:10.779
Keep off your feet, if possible.

01:24:14.483 --> 01:24:16.027
And, um...

01:24:16.051 --> 01:24:17.253
I'm sorry for your loss.

01:24:18.187 --> 01:24:19.588
Thank you, Doctor.

01:24:52.455 --> 01:24:53.589
It's never easy, is it?

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:56.192
So young.

01:24:57.193 --> 01:24:58.261
So vulnerable.

01:25:00.129 --> 01:25:01.530
You have my condolences.

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:04.567
However...

01:25:06.869 --> 01:25:08.671
What if I told you I
could bring him back?
