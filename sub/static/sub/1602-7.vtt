Previously on Bates Motel... </i>

00:01.778 --> 00:04.241
(Marcus) I am gonna be the sheriff here.
That's a done deal.

00:04.304 --> 00:06.004
I could use a guy like you.

00:09.342 --> 00:11.076
Caleb's in town.
He's up at my farm.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.611
He just wants to talk to you,

00:12.712 --> 00:15.184
to tell you that he's sorry
that it ever happened.

00:16.683 --> 00:17.749
Norma, stop it!

00:17.851 --> 00:19.184
Leave me the hell alone!

00:19.285 --> 00:20.619
- Norman!
- Mother!

00:20.720 --> 00:22.821
Your brother
will look after you!

00:22.922 --> 00:24.857
Mother!

00:24.958 --> 00:26.792
Norman?
Norman.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.127
(Dylan)
What are you doing?

00:28.228 --> 00:29.595
I'm just making
some breakfast.

00:29.696 --> 00:30.929
French toast.

00:31.030 --> 00:33.198
- Norman?
- Norman's sleeping.

00:33.299 --> 00:34.800
(Norma)
My son isn't normal.

00:34.901 --> 00:35.801
There's something
wrong with him.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.436
How so?
Like, physically?

00:37.537 --> 00:39.037
You know how my husband
was in an accident?

00:39.139 --> 00:40.873
Your son did it.

00:40.974 --> 00:45.144
You've been carrying this burden
around alone a long time.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.945
We're going to the farm
to talk to your uncle.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.848
[crying]
I'm so sorry.

00:49.949 --> 00:52.317
I'm so sorry.

00:52.418 --> 00:54.353
I'm so sorry.

[rings bell]

01:10.136 --> 01:13.071
Hi.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.340
Hey.

01:15.441 --> 01:17.209
So everything's
calming down?

01:17.310 --> 01:20.846
She came back yesterday.

01:20.947 --> 01:24.082
Yeah, well,
she came back yesterday.

01:24.184 --> 01:27.786
Did you talk to her
about Norman yet?

01:27.887 --> 01:30.255
Not yet, no.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.494
I want to do something for you.

01:35.595 --> 01:37.095
To thank you.

01:37.197 --> 01:41.433
Uh, can I maybe buy you dinner
some night this week?

01:41.534 --> 01:42.434
I know it's not much, but...

01:42.535 --> 01:43.435
[car door slams]

01:43.536 --> 01:44.736
Tomorrow night would work.

01:47.707 --> 01:50.275
(Will) Emma, you're
coming home, right now.

01:50.376 --> 01:53.011
Dad, I'm fine.

01:53.112 --> 01:54.780
Do you know Dylan,
Norman's brother?

01:54.881 --> 01:56.748
- Hey.
- Hello, Dylan.

01:56.849 --> 01:59.084
I'm sorry.
I told her not to come in today.

01:59.185 --> 02:01.620
She's still recovering
from that night with no sleep.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.956
Uh, I'm really sorry.
I didn't... I didn't realize...

02:04.057 --> 02:05.924
It's not your fault.
It's hers.

02:06.025 --> 02:07.726
She doesn't realize
her own limitations.

02:07.827 --> 02:09.026
It's helped her
most of her life...

02:09.127 --> 02:10.929
- Dad!
- Emma, get your stuff.

02:11.030 --> 02:13.031
We're going home, now.

02:19.839 --> 02:21.873
[gentle music]

02:21.975 --> 02:23.809
Sorry.

02:23.910 --> 02:26.979
It's fine.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.748
She doesn't want to accept
the truth about her health.

02:29.849 --> 02:33.252
I don't either,
but it is the truth.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.087
And I'm not gonna let
her life get shortened

02:35.188 --> 02:36.455
if it's in my power.

What?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.570
- Where were you all night?
- I told you.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.505
I drove around, and I spent
the night in a motel.

02:53.606 --> 02:57.175
Nothing exciting.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.944
Norman, stop it.
You're acting like a twit.

02:59.045 --> 03:01.179
It's not masculine,
and it's not attractive.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.914
(clerk)
I got you all set up.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.850
Looks like you've got
a few messages.

03:04.951 --> 03:07.452
Mm, yeah, I dropped my phone
in the mud.

03:07.553 --> 03:09.254
Thank you so much.

03:09.355 --> 03:10.322
Come on, Norman, let's go.

03:10.423 --> 03:12.257
Oh, yes, Mother.
Here I come.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.926
Following after you in a very
masculine and attractive way.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.395
[door open alert dings]

03:16.496 --> 03:20.165
Holy crap, Dylan left, like,
a hundred messages.

03:21.734 --> 03:22.868
Oh, my Lord.

03:22.969 --> 03:24.936
What was going on
with you two?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.605
Jeez, all I did was leave
for a few hours.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.206
With a suitcase.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.841
We spent the night wondering
if you were ever coming back.

03:29.942 --> 03:31.343
If you were dead.

03:31.444 --> 03:34.046
What does death have to do
with a suitcase?

03:34.147 --> 03:35.514
What the hell?

03:35.615 --> 03:37.683
Alex left me a message
saying he was shot?

03:37.784 --> 03:38.984
What do you mean
he's been shot?

03:39.085 --> 03:42.521
I don't know.
What the hell?

03:42.622 --> 03:44.289
I mean, can't a woman get
in a freaking mood for one night

03:44.390 --> 03:45.657
without the whole world
coming to an end?

03:45.758 --> 03:47.559
A mood?

03:49.796 --> 03:50.829
Hi, Alex, it's Norma.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.465
What's going on?
Call me.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.368
Ow! Ugh.

03:56.469 --> 04:00.505
[engine starts]

- Hello?
- Norman!

04:59.465 --> 05:00.465
Uggh, yeah.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.134
Uh, yes.
This is the right number.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.404
She's just waddling
through the gravel as we speak.

05:05.505 --> 05:09.241
Uh, it's James.

05:09.342 --> 05:11.643
Hi, James.
Hi, I'm fine.

05:11.744 --> 05:14.112
Everything's fine.
Yeah.

05:14.213 --> 05:16.248
No, I'm back home now.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.750
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, can I call you back?

05:18.851 --> 05:21.586
Okay, bye.

05:21.687 --> 05:24.956
Well, I'm gonna go
to the office.

05:25.057 --> 05:26.958
Well, you are the manager,
so, yeah.

05:27.059 --> 05:28.827
Go manage.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.244
W-where the hell
have you been?

05:46.345 --> 05:47.512
I went to the phone store.

05:47.613 --> 05:48.513
W-what are you doing
in my house?

05:48.614 --> 05:50.015
What's going on?

05:50.116 --> 05:52.350
Why haven't you answered
your texts for 36 hours?

05:52.452 --> 05:53.652
I thought you were dead.

05:53.753 --> 05:55.187
I just lost my phone.

05:55.288 --> 05:59.458
Why does everyone immediately
jump to "I died"?

05:59.559 --> 06:02.761
Maybe I jumped to it
because you put yourself and me

06:02.862 --> 06:04.095
in a vulnerable position,

06:04.197 --> 06:07.132
making that alleged deal
with Bob Paris.

06:07.233 --> 06:09.935
Alex, don't start, okay?
I am not dead.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.371
I'm alive. You're alive.
Whoopee.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.614
Well, somebody
tried to kill me,

06:22.715 --> 06:24.883
and I could only assume
it was a message from Bob, so...

06:24.984 --> 06:26.051
Are you sure?
That does not make sense.

06:26.152 --> 06:27.719
Bob seemed fine.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.287
Oh, now you're gonna tell me
how things work around here?

06:29.388 --> 06:30.989
I just don't think that
you should assume

06:31.090 --> 06:33.725
that he's the one
who tried to kill you.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.361
You know, I could be dead.
I-I did get shot at.

06:36.462 --> 06:38.964
Well, it looks like
it went right through you.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.169
- Where's the flash drive?
- Why?

06:44.270 --> 06:45.737
Because I need to know
what I'm dealing with.

06:45.838 --> 06:47.339
Why do you have to drag
my flash drive into it?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.641
You wanted me as an ally.
I gave that to you.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.577
I respected you.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.015
Fine.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.717
Dylan hid it at the farm.

06:58.818 --> 07:01.686
It's taped under
a grow light timer at the cabin.

07:01.787 --> 07:04.723
Some kid named Gunner
knows how to open it.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.458
What kind of name
is Gunner, anyway?

07:06.559 --> 07:08.493
A stupid one.

07:13.032 --> 07:16.034
[bell jingles]

07:27.980 --> 07:29.881
Can I help you?

07:29.982 --> 07:32.050
Hey, Mr. Decody.

07:32.151 --> 07:36.555
I know this isn't any
of my business, but, um...

07:36.656 --> 07:39.591
I wanted to ask you
about Emma.

07:39.692 --> 07:42.060
Come in the back.

07:44.897 --> 07:47.966
She won't be with us
forever.

07:48.067 --> 07:50.769
Maybe another few years.

07:50.870 --> 07:54.739
She won't accept what
the doctors are telling her.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.608
She won't stop doing
everything she wants to do,

07:56.709 --> 07:59.210
and it's at the point
where it's too much for her.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.946
She's aggravating
the situation

08:01.047 --> 08:02.881
and shortening the time
she has left,

08:02.982 --> 08:06.551
and I won't
let that happen.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.887
I'm so sorry
to hear that.

08:10.723 --> 08:14.292
I appreciate that.

08:14.393 --> 08:16.227
I have her on a list
for a lung transplant,

08:16.329 --> 08:20.632
but it's... it's not likely
she'll make the top of the list.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.337
Not enough people
want to donate their organs.

08:27.707 --> 08:29.126
There must be something.

08:30.872 --> 08:33.912
I hear there's a hospital
in Portland

08:34.013 --> 08:37.916
where for the right donation,

08:38.017 --> 08:41.019
they'll move the patients
up the transplant list.

08:44.523 --> 08:46.124
How much does it take?

08:46.225 --> 08:48.093
Oh, I don't know.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.963
I heard something
like $20,000.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.532
Whatever it is,
it's way beyond my means.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.609
I'll be in touch.

09:11.032 --> 09:14.034
[hammering]

09:15.136 --> 09:18.605

[birds chirping]

09:31.178 --> 09:32.812
Hey.

09:32.914 --> 09:34.414
- Hey, Sheriff.
- Hey, Gunner.

09:34.515 --> 09:35.749
What can we do for you?

09:35.816 --> 09:39.986
Uh, can I talk
to you inside for...

09:40.087 --> 09:42.622
I-I don't know you, do I?

09:42.723 --> 09:44.758
(Gunner)
Oh, that's Dylan's uncle, Caleb.

09:46.794 --> 09:47.827
You... you're Norma's brother?

09:47.929 --> 09:49.663
Yeah.

09:51.032 --> 09:52.566
Come inside.

10:20.928 --> 10:24.698
I hear you can open
the file on this.

10:24.765 --> 10:26.333
No one here is gonna be
in trouble for any of this.

10:26.434 --> 10:28.068
Come on.

10:28.135 --> 10:29.502
I don't know what that is.

10:29.604 --> 10:30.670
As far as I know,
it's just a piece

10:30.771 --> 10:32.339
of the timer
for the grow light.

10:32.406 --> 10:34.908
Gunner, don't make me
get out the gun

10:34.976 --> 10:37.210
and bang your head against
the wall and all that shit,

10:37.311 --> 10:39.579
'cause I will do just that.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.448
So open it.

10:41.515 --> 10:42.983
[sighs]

10:49.156 --> 10:51.524
[typing]

11:05.006 --> 11:08.942
It's some kind of ledger.

11:17.551 --> 11:20.186
What?

11:23.924 --> 11:24.924
What?

11:25.026 --> 11:26.760
You can tell Dylan
I have it.

11:26.827 --> 11:28.428
Hey...

11:30.364 --> 11:32.265
Thanks.

11:32.366 --> 11:33.933
Pull.

11:34.035 --> 11:36.202
[gunshot]

11:38.305 --> 11:40.807
- Don't even start.
- Let him by.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.709
Go ahead.

11:42.810 --> 11:45.745
I'm gonna kick your ass someday,
and I'm gonna enjoy it.

11:47.381 --> 11:49.249
I got a question for you
about a name on that ledger.

11:49.350 --> 11:51.618
I was wondering
when you'd actually look at it.

11:51.719 --> 11:55.622
Took an awful lot on faith
from that Bates woman.

11:55.723 --> 11:58.758
You finally saw
your mom's name on that ledger.

12:00.394 --> 12:01.928
She's been dead 22 years,

12:02.029 --> 12:03.396
and she'd be rolling
in her grave thinking

12:03.497 --> 12:04.964
her name's on
some piece of shit like that.

12:05.032 --> 12:06.599
It wasn't me.
I didn't put it on there.

12:06.701 --> 12:09.002
- Then who did?
- Your father.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.472
He set up that holding company
way back.

12:12.573 --> 12:16.009
"Thanks, Bob."
You're welcome, Alex.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.277
So maybe now
you'll help me.

12:17.378 --> 12:18.578
(man)
Pull.

12:18.679 --> 12:20.947
[gunshot in the distance]

12:22.049 --> 12:25.051
[phone vibrating]

12:26.420 --> 12:28.088
[sighs]

12:28.155 --> 12:30.523
I need to talk to you.

12:35.262 --> 12:37.464
[stammers] I can't let him
back in my life, Dylan.

12:37.531 --> 12:39.332
Don't ask for the moon,
okay?

12:39.433 --> 12:41.968
Just because we had one operatic
meeting in the middle of a field

12:42.069 --> 12:43.036
doesn't mean
we're all gonna hang out now

12:43.137 --> 12:44.204
and go bowling together.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.605
Okay, you... you have
to be realistic.

12:45.706 --> 12:47.107
We can't just erase
what happened.

12:47.174 --> 12:49.709
I actually wanted to talk
to you about Norman.

12:52.613 --> 12:54.547
Oh.

13:05.459 --> 13:06.793
I know this is gonna be
hard for you to hear,

13:06.894 --> 13:08.995
but you need to hear it.

13:11.332 --> 13:14.534
That night you were gone,

13:14.635 --> 13:17.070
Norman pretty much
lost his mind.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.172
He... he... he blacked out.

13:19.273 --> 13:20.640
Okay, but he...

13:20.741 --> 13:22.509
Not for minutes,
for hours.

13:22.576 --> 13:25.078
Okay, and then he kept wandering
around the house that way.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.880
I found him in the basement
with a dead pigeon.

13:26.981 --> 13:28.414
That's nothing new
for Norman.

13:28.482 --> 13:29.549
There's always something dead
in the basement.

13:29.650 --> 13:31.718
He's not okay.

13:31.819 --> 13:34.888
All right?
He's... he's hallucinating.

13:34.989 --> 13:36.389
I found him in here

13:36.490 --> 13:37.891
in the middle of the night
cooking breakfast.

13:37.992 --> 13:39.592
Who doesn't want breakfast
at some point

13:39.660 --> 13:40.693
in the middle of the night?

13:40.761 --> 13:43.196
He was wearing
your robe.

13:43.297 --> 13:45.165
And then he told me
that I needed to go

13:45.266 --> 13:48.368
wake up my brother, Norman,
for breakfast.

13:50.504 --> 13:53.106
He thinks he's you,
Norma.

13:56.510 --> 14:00.413
Look, this has been circling us
for a long time, and...

14:00.514 --> 14:05.218
And... and we just... we... we keep
looking the other direction.

14:05.319 --> 14:07.520
The blacking out, the...

14:07.588 --> 14:09.022
The cutting up
all the dead animals.

14:09.123 --> 14:10.423
Blaire Watson.

14:10.524 --> 14:12.091
The polygraph
completely disproved that.

14:12.159 --> 14:15.395
It's all way too much
together to be dismissed.

14:19.533 --> 14:22.402
But I'm keeping him home.
He's gonna be safe.

14:22.503 --> 14:23.736
Are you gonna...
You gonna lock him up

14:23.804 --> 14:25.605
when you need
to go somewhere?

14:25.706 --> 14:27.106
Maybe.

14:29.877 --> 14:33.112
We need to do something.

14:33.180 --> 14:35.348
We have to deal with it.

14:55.086 --> 14:56.720
[door buzzer]

14:56.821 --> 14:59.823
[indistinct PA announcement]

15:07.999 --> 15:10.600
[indistinct chatter]

15:22.113 --> 15:25.448
[indistinct PA announcement]

15:25.549 --> 15:26.916
Alex.

15:30.655 --> 15:33.023
You're looking well.

15:34.859 --> 15:37.694
Yeah, well, um...

15:37.762 --> 15:40.263
it's, uh,
it's not a social visit.

15:40.364 --> 15:42.666
Why would it be?

15:46.937 --> 15:50.940
What does it matter?
It's... it's a name on a ledger.

15:51.042 --> 15:53.176
I don't understand
your attitude.

15:53.277 --> 15:55.612
I made a lot of money
for a lot of people.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.781
You were a dirty cop
to the rotten core.

15:57.882 --> 15:59.249
That's what you were.

15:59.316 --> 16:02.385
Oh, yeah?
And you're Prince Charming?

16:02.486 --> 16:05.188
I'm nothing like you.

16:05.289 --> 16:06.790
You're gonna take her name
off that ledger,

16:06.891 --> 16:07.924
or I'm gonna kill you.

16:08.025 --> 16:10.360
You got that?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.362
Use one of your dead
friends instead.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.097
Okay, I'm sure you got
a lot of them.

16:14.198 --> 16:15.932
You're not using her.
Not anymore.

16:16.033 --> 16:17.233
Fine, fine, fine.
You don't have to make

16:17.334 --> 16:19.135
such a big deal
out of everything

16:19.236 --> 16:21.871
like you always did.

16:21.972 --> 16:23.573
It's annoying.

16:23.674 --> 16:26.242
But there's no telling
you anything, huh?

16:26.343 --> 16:28.878
You always know best,
don't you?

16:28.979 --> 16:32.882
And you...
You vilified me

16:32.983 --> 16:35.452
for your mother's death
for 22 years,

16:35.519 --> 16:38.121
and she's the one
that chose to leave that way.

16:38.222 --> 16:40.990
No, you drove her to it.
You drove her to it.

16:41.092 --> 16:43.193
- I did no such thing.
- You drove her to it.

16:43.260 --> 16:45.261
I loved her.

16:51.535 --> 16:54.571
Nice seeing you, Alex.

17:00.111 --> 17:01.211
[door buzzes]

17:01.278 --> 17:05.381
[door opens and shuts]

17:07.752 --> 17:09.618
[groans]

17:12.021 --> 17:13.656
Ow.

17:17.294 --> 17:19.329
Hey, you think, um,
there's any chance

17:19.396 --> 17:21.765
I could maybe stop by
the house, ever?

17:25.569 --> 17:27.971
I don't think so.

17:28.038 --> 17:31.274
Yeah.
Yeah, no, I get it.

17:31.375 --> 17:32.842
(Caleb)
I get it.

17:32.943 --> 17:35.645
[pounding on door]

17:35.746 --> 17:37.614
(Chick)
Hey.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.649
[door closing]

17:39.750 --> 17:43.620
Found these
in my garage.

17:43.687 --> 17:47.857
(Chick)
I tried to grow pot once.

17:47.958 --> 17:50.493
After I got
out of that hospital.

17:50.594 --> 17:53.663
I didn't have the touch.

17:53.764 --> 17:55.165
Thanks.

17:55.232 --> 17:56.933
Yeah, that should...
That should be helpful.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.336
So you and I got
some things to go over?

18:02.072 --> 18:03.206
(Caleb)
Yeah.

18:03.307 --> 18:05.642
Look, about that.
I changed my mind.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.978
You just...
changed it, huh?

18:11.482 --> 18:13.750
You think you'll
change it back?

18:13.851 --> 18:15.318
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

18:15.419 --> 18:18.154
Your dad was gonna
do a run for me.

18:18.255 --> 18:20.824
A run of what?

18:20.891 --> 18:24.260
Apparently nobody needs to know,
now that no one's doing it.

18:24.361 --> 18:28.598
Look... sorry,
but things have changed.

18:28.699 --> 18:31.501
Okay, I don't want
to take the risk anymore.

18:33.604 --> 18:35.538
How much this "run" pay?

18:35.639 --> 18:38.441
After FICA
and Social Security?

18:38.542 --> 18:39.776
$25,000.

18:39.877 --> 18:41.945
Hey, Dylan?
What's the run?

18:42.012 --> 18:43.246
Guns.

18:43.347 --> 18:45.682
How risky?

18:45.783 --> 18:48.451
It's gun running.

18:48.552 --> 18:52.055
S... so in the running
of guns spectrum,

18:52.156 --> 18:54.123
it's relatively mild.

18:54.191 --> 18:56.226
(Chick)
I've done it for years.

18:56.293 --> 18:58.027
One run.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.729
25 grand.
That's all I'm up for.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.130
Look, you're not
doing it.

19:01.198 --> 19:02.532
That'll give me time
to get another driver.

19:02.633 --> 19:06.769
He's not doing it.

19:06.837 --> 19:11.474
You guys talk it over
and let me know by tonight.

19:13.310 --> 19:15.044
Or else I'll have
to do it myself,

19:15.112 --> 19:18.281
and I'd rather stay here
because it's my kid's birthday.

19:25.189 --> 19:28.157
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

19:28.225 --> 19:30.994
A situation came up.

19:31.095 --> 19:32.729
I need money.
There's this girl.

19:32.830 --> 19:35.465
She was up here once.
She wears oxygen.

19:35.566 --> 19:37.133
Wait, you got that girl
in trouble?

19:37.234 --> 19:38.601
No, it's nothing
like that.

19:38.702 --> 19:41.170
She, uh, she's a friend.

19:41.238 --> 19:43.740
She works in the motel.

19:43.841 --> 19:46.409
She has cystic fibrosis.

19:46.510 --> 19:47.410
And she... she needs
a lung transplant,

19:47.511 --> 19:48.845
or she's gonna die.

19:48.946 --> 19:51.514
Look, I just don't think
this is a solution.

19:51.615 --> 19:53.650
If anything happened to you,

19:53.751 --> 19:57.220
especially something
that I somehow brought on you,

19:57.321 --> 19:59.155
I don't know
what would happen to me.

20:03.894 --> 20:05.161
I'm sorry, but you
can't do it.

20:05.262 --> 20:07.263
It's the end
of the conversation.

20:11.268 --> 20:12.335
[door shuts]

20:18.995 --> 20:20.428
(James)
Hi, Norma.

20:20.530 --> 20:22.430
What are you doing here?

20:22.498 --> 20:26.434
You... you left in a pretty
agitated state the other day.

20:26.536 --> 20:28.737
You won't return any
of my messages.

20:28.838 --> 20:30.839
I was worried about you.

20:30.907 --> 20:33.475
Well, it's just been
really busy.

20:33.543 --> 20:34.876
I, uh, I talked
to my brother.

20:34.977 --> 20:39.581
It's okay.
Everything's fine.

20:39.649 --> 20:42.651
I... highly doubt that.

20:42.752 --> 20:44.252
Just given the things
that you were

20:44.353 --> 20:46.555
talking to me about,
everything about your son.

20:46.656 --> 20:48.657
Everything that
you're going through.

20:59.135 --> 21:02.938
Okay, I am very worried
about Norman.

21:03.039 --> 21:04.673
Maybe you could
talk to him?

21:04.774 --> 21:06.875
Of course.

21:06.943 --> 21:09.110
Look, at... at some point,
I'd be happy to...

21:09.212 --> 21:11.046
Okay, c-come on in.
Come in.

21:16.586 --> 21:18.820
- [steps approaching, door opens]
- (Norma) Norman?

21:18.921 --> 21:20.288
There's someone
I want you to meet.

21:20.389 --> 21:21.656
I'm busy right now,
mother.

21:21.757 --> 21:22.991
This'll just be
for a minute.

21:23.059 --> 21:25.160
Come on down, James.

21:25.228 --> 21:28.063
Hi, Norman.

21:28.130 --> 21:29.364
James Finnigan.

21:29.465 --> 21:31.399
Licensed family therapist.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.201
Your mother asked me
if I could come down

21:33.302 --> 21:35.370
and just talk
to you for minute.

21:35.471 --> 21:37.205
Please, Norman.

21:37.306 --> 21:39.207
Oh, no, I'm... I'm more than
happy to talk to James,

21:39.308 --> 21:41.076
if you think that's best.

21:41.143 --> 21:42.911
But I'd like
to do it alone.

21:42.979 --> 21:44.880
Oh, of course.
Yes, I understand.

21:44.981 --> 21:46.548
Hmm, okay, I'm... going to be
upstairs if you need anything.

21:46.616 --> 21:48.250
Great.

21:48.351 --> 21:50.418
I'm sure James and I
won't be needing you, Mother.

21:57.627 --> 21:58.894
I don't want you
to be nervous about

21:58.995 --> 22:01.696
talking to me, Norman.

22:01.797 --> 22:04.532
This is what I do.
I'm a professional.

22:04.634 --> 22:07.068
Helped a lot of people.

22:07.169 --> 22:10.605
I-I'm not nervous.

22:10.706 --> 22:12.407
That must be
really nice, huh?

22:12.508 --> 22:15.243
To help people.

22:15.344 --> 22:18.046
It is.

22:18.147 --> 22:20.415
So you like taxidermy, no?

22:20.516 --> 22:23.585
Yeah, I do.

22:23.653 --> 22:26.354
I find it very peaceful.

22:26.455 --> 22:29.057
Sort of allows me
to shut the world out.

22:29.158 --> 22:30.926
"Shut the world out."

22:33.162 --> 22:35.096
Yeah, sometimes when
I'm in the world,

22:35.197 --> 22:38.133
I feel almost like
there's this annoying

22:38.200 --> 22:41.970
sort of buzzing
that just won't stop.

22:42.071 --> 22:43.538
And then I get down here
with my animals,

22:43.639 --> 22:47.208
and it all goes silent.

22:47.310 --> 22:49.811
It's interesting.

22:49.912 --> 22:52.180
Tell me more about that.

22:52.281 --> 22:55.750
Of the... "buzzing"
you experience.

22:58.220 --> 23:01.423
Well, it's like a world
full of people.

23:01.490 --> 23:03.892
So many people,
all with opinions

23:03.960 --> 23:07.629
and judgments and arrogance
and theories.

23:07.730 --> 23:10.432
People who think
that they help people.

23:10.499 --> 23:12.834
And they're pointless.
None of them know anything.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.169
You might as well listen
to a woodpecker

23:14.236 --> 23:15.870
pecking in a tree.

23:18.407 --> 23:21.910
Can I ask you something now?

23:21.978 --> 23:23.845
Of course, shoot.

23:23.946 --> 23:27.782
How was it,
sleeping with my mother?

23:30.052 --> 23:32.635
What makes you think I slept
with your mother, Norman?

23:35.257 --> 23:37.450
Let's just say
I've known her a long time.

23:39.261 --> 23:43.365
And would it bother you if
someone slept with your mother?

23:45.634 --> 23:49.371
Let's see... if your mother
ran out on you

23:49.438 --> 23:50.972
and your brother one night,

23:51.073 --> 23:52.540
didn't tell you where
she was going

23:52.641 --> 23:55.343
or when she was coming back,
and then threw herself,

23:55.444 --> 23:57.812
like a whore, into the bed of
someone she barely knows,

23:57.913 --> 24:00.882
some... licensed family
therapist who could probably

24:00.983 --> 24:02.350
lose his license
for such behavior,

24:02.451 --> 24:05.153
but that's not
really the point...

24:05.254 --> 24:08.890
Would all of that
behavior bother you?

24:08.991 --> 24:10.892
Yes, it might.

24:13.095 --> 24:14.654
So what was she like?

24:16.832 --> 24:19.381
That's not an appropriate
question, Norman.

24:20.436 --> 24:23.171
Come on.
We're both men here.

24:23.272 --> 24:26.875
It's not like we don't know
what goes on.

24:26.942 --> 24:29.344
Did she give-to easily?

24:29.445 --> 24:32.047
You know, I think
we're done here.

24:32.148 --> 24:34.682
What, are you uncomfortable?

24:34.784 --> 24:36.451
Huh?
'Cause I know?

24:36.552 --> 24:38.853
'Cause I can imagine
what it was like?

24:38.954 --> 24:40.722
Did you really think
that you'd come down here

24:40.823 --> 24:42.891
and it would be
your little secret?

24:42.992 --> 24:44.726
"Oh, we banged each other,
but now let's send you

24:44.827 --> 24:46.763
downstairs to fix
crazy Norman."

24:49.565 --> 24:51.800
Norman, why do you care
so much who your mother

24:51.901 --> 24:54.169
might be sleeping with?

24:56.172 --> 24:58.506
What does it mean?

24:58.607 --> 25:00.809
That she could be
attracted to someone?

25:00.910 --> 25:04.212
Does that...
take her away from you?

25:09.385 --> 25:12.487
Norman, do you want
to sleep with her?

25:16.358 --> 25:17.258
[snarls]

25:17.359 --> 25:19.727
[gasps, grunts]

25:19.829 --> 25:21.396
How dare you come
into my house

25:21.497 --> 25:24.666
and say such an ugly thing
to me?

25:25.768 --> 25:29.003
[struggling for air]

25:29.105 --> 25:31.239

25:38.214 --> 25:41.249
[panting]

25:41.317 --> 25:42.884
James?

25:42.952 --> 25:45.687
(Norma) James, what's wrong?
What happened?

25:45.788 --> 25:48.690
Get him some help, Norma.

25:48.791 --> 25:50.258
Right away.

25:53.229 --> 25:54.229
[door slams shut]

25:59.897 --> 26:02.632
What happened with him?

26:02.733 --> 26:04.534
Nothing.

26:04.635 --> 26:06.569
He... he just said
horrible things to me.

26:06.670 --> 26:08.915
- Like what?
- I can't even tell you.

26:17.614 --> 26:20.082
I'm sorry.

26:20.184 --> 26:22.652
I'm so sorry, Norman.

26:29.126 --> 26:31.627
I just miss you.

26:31.728 --> 26:35.565
I miss how close
we used to be.

26:35.666 --> 26:36.966
Everything's changing.

26:37.067 --> 26:38.367
I don't know why it is,
but it is,

26:38.469 --> 26:40.903
and it's just
changing so fast.

26:41.004 --> 26:43.139
Nothing will ever change
between us, Norman.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.589
I am your mother,
and I always will be.

26:49.012 --> 26:51.814
Okay? I'm sorry I left
the other night.

26:51.915 --> 26:53.149
I just went a little mad.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.017
I mean, we all go
a little mad sometimes.

26:55.118 --> 26:57.753
It... it was a mistake.

26:57.855 --> 27:00.756
But I'm home now,
and I'm not going anywhere.

27:00.858 --> 27:04.093
And nothing means as much
to me as being your mother.

27:07.965 --> 27:09.031
I'll make us some dinner,

27:09.132 --> 27:12.101
and we can spend
some time together.

27:12.202 --> 27:14.203
Okay, Mother.

27:20.677 --> 27:23.679
[phone rings]

27:25.649 --> 27:27.717
Hi, Alex.

27:27.818 --> 27:29.385
(Alex)
Hey, um... Hey, Norma.

27:29.486 --> 27:32.021
I, um...
[laughs]

27:32.122 --> 27:33.389
I-I need a favor.

27:33.490 --> 27:34.957
I-I-I don't have
anyone else to call.

27:35.058 --> 27:36.225
(Norma)
[scoffs]

27:36.326 --> 27:37.560
(Alex)
I need you to come get me.

27:37.661 --> 27:39.862
Are... are you okay?
You sound weird.

27:39.963 --> 27:42.298
I can't drive
and I can't be

27:42.399 --> 27:46.102
walking around town
like this, and...

27:46.203 --> 27:48.871
Okay.

27:48.972 --> 27:50.273
Are you drunk?

27:56.880 --> 27:58.948
Emma!

27:59.049 --> 28:01.918
You gotta be kidding me.
Where you going?

28:02.019 --> 28:03.452
I was gonna go and grab
some dinner with Dylan.

28:03.554 --> 28:05.087
(Will)
Dammit, Emma.

28:05.188 --> 28:08.324
I'm sick and tired of having
to play the bad guy here.

28:08.425 --> 28:09.959
(Will)
You need to use your head.

28:10.060 --> 28:11.460
You're acting like
you can somehow control this

28:11.562 --> 28:14.063
by keeping me locked
inside that house.

28:14.164 --> 28:15.898
But you and I both know
that won't make a difference.

28:15.999 --> 28:19.001
My... my time is gonna pass
no matter what you do.

28:19.102 --> 28:21.837
So I might as well do something
with it that I want.

28:21.939 --> 28:24.073
This really amazing person wants
to take me to dinner tonight

28:24.174 --> 28:26.309
and all I want in the world
right now is to spend

28:26.410 --> 28:28.878
some of whatever time
I've got left with him.

28:28.979 --> 28:31.280
I can't even tell you
why that's so important.

28:37.187 --> 28:39.889
If I let you go right now,

28:39.990 --> 28:42.525
I don't want you to think
you've won this argument.

28:48.332 --> 28:50.166
Never.

29:07.751 --> 29:09.518
Wh... where's your car?

29:09.620 --> 29:11.721
I traded it in.

29:11.822 --> 29:13.055
I don't know what
I was trying to prove.

29:13.156 --> 29:14.457
You know, I... I wish I didn't.

29:14.558 --> 29:17.293
Ugh, I hate it.
I miss my car.

29:29.673 --> 29:31.624
What is going on
with you?

29:33.121 --> 29:34.505
[straining]

29:36.513 --> 29:39.081
Oh, my... you are a mess.

29:44.621 --> 29:45.855
Can you just drop me off
at my house?

29:45.956 --> 29:47.523
No way, you need
looking after.

29:47.624 --> 29:49.025
No, no, no, no, I'm fine.
I'll be... I don't want

29:49.126 --> 29:50.426
to put you out, just...
Just drop me off at my house.

29:50.527 --> 29:52.728
Aw, man, shut up.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.699
You're gonna sleep here
for a few hours.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.501
- All right.
- Okay?

29:58.602 --> 29:59.969
I'm gonna go make dinner
and then I'll come check on you.

30:00.070 --> 30:02.104
All right.

30:10.180 --> 30:12.682
Alex, what happened?

30:12.783 --> 30:15.618
Hmm?

30:15.719 --> 30:17.953
Uh...
[grumbles]

30:21.892 --> 30:26.529
One of the names on the ledger
was my... was my mom.

30:26.630 --> 30:32.068
She's, uh... she's been
dead 22 years.

30:32.169 --> 30:34.637
Suicide.

30:34.738 --> 30:36.639
And my dad, he's...

30:36.740 --> 30:39.875
He was the one
who set up the trust.

30:39.976 --> 30:41.243
He's in prison.

30:41.344 --> 30:45.147
(Alex) And he was using
her name to, uh,

30:45.248 --> 30:50.553
collect her share of, uh,
of... of the drug profits.

30:50.654 --> 30:54.457
I'm so sorry, Alex.

30:54.558 --> 30:57.827
Yeah, that's my sad story.

31:01.331 --> 31:02.874
Life is so hard, isn't it?

31:05.836 --> 31:07.670
Sometimes.

31:46.853 --> 31:48.711
I'm... I'm gonna
go make dinner, okay?

31:48.812 --> 31:51.671
And I'll... I'll... I'll come...
I'll come back.

31:53.583 --> 31:54.740
I think you're beautiful.

31:57.721 --> 31:58.988
You're drunk.
You're not gonna like

31:59.089 --> 32:01.457
that you said that
to me tomorrow.

32:01.558 --> 32:03.392
Probably.
[laughs]

32:13.103 --> 32:15.371
- Smells great.
- Chicken Marsala.

32:15.472 --> 32:17.306
Be ready in about
half hour.

32:17.407 --> 32:19.041
I thought we could eat
dinner here tonight,

32:19.142 --> 32:20.976
and make it special.

32:22.979 --> 32:27.516
Oh, I, um... I didn't know
that you were making dinner.

32:27.617 --> 32:30.352
Uh, I... I have plans
to meet with Emma.

32:30.453 --> 32:32.822
Why are you having
dinner with Emma?

32:32.923 --> 32:34.089
Well, she, uh,
she stayed over here

32:34.191 --> 32:35.424
the night that you
were gone

32:35.525 --> 32:38.427
to help with Norman,
and I just... I... I wanted

32:38.528 --> 32:39.862
to take her to dinner.

32:39.963 --> 32:41.764
Norman, yeah.

32:41.865 --> 32:44.099
But why don't we talk
about that tomorrow?

32:44.201 --> 32:47.169
Tonight, let's just
have a nice family dinner.

32:47.270 --> 32:49.555
Okay, why not invite Emma here?
I would love to have her.

32:51.842 --> 32:55.077
Sure.
Okay, yeah, I'll ask her.

32:55.178 --> 32:57.012
Okay.

33:10.560 --> 33:13.929
[clipping]

33:14.965 --> 33:17.833
[tense music]

33:39.856 --> 33:41.457
What are you doing here?

33:41.558 --> 33:43.626
I picked you some flowers.

33:43.727 --> 33:46.028
I remember you like these.

33:46.129 --> 33:47.696
They're lupins.

33:51.768 --> 33:55.237
Hey, we used to run around
the hills and pick them?

33:58.375 --> 34:01.010
Well, I... I was just gonna
leave them for you.

34:01.111 --> 34:03.312
Um, and this note...

34:03.413 --> 34:06.649
Is...

34:06.750 --> 34:12.454
Basically saying thank you
for talking to me the other day.

34:17.494 --> 34:21.597
It meant a lot to me.
Here.

34:27.437 --> 34:29.438
We can't be friends, Caleb.

34:35.245 --> 34:38.547
No, I understand.

34:38.648 --> 34:40.382
All right.

34:40.483 --> 34:42.820
Okay.
Good-bye, Norma.

34:48.725 --> 34:50.659
Caleb?

34:54.266 --> 34:55.813
Do you want to stay
for dinner?

34:59.432 --> 35:00.903
Hmm. Just for tonight.

35:08.278 --> 35:10.708
The family's here, we can...
We can all be together.

35:12.315 --> 35:13.624
But maybe just for tonight.

35:23.479 --> 35:25.080
Where's Norman?

35:25.181 --> 35:28.950
He's, uh, he's working
on something in the basement.

35:29.051 --> 35:31.553
[door opens]

35:35.324 --> 35:37.513
My brother's
joining us for dinner.

35:39.729 --> 35:41.029
I'm gonna get the food
on the table.

35:41.130 --> 35:42.422
It's almost done.

35:54.377 --> 35:56.912
Uh, Caleb,
you remember Emma.

35:57.013 --> 35:59.114
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:59.215 --> 36:01.923
I'm so happy you're
having dinner with us.

36:03.286 --> 36:06.177
I'm gonna go see if Norma
needs any help in the kitchen.

36:10.426 --> 36:13.128
So she's the one?

36:13.229 --> 36:15.397
Yeah.

36:15.498 --> 36:17.766
No, I totally get it.

36:43.059 --> 36:45.727
Ah, she got a piano.
I'm glad.

36:45.828 --> 36:49.331
She always loved music.
It's so good.

36:52.735 --> 36:54.569
So do you want a Chardonnay
or a Pinot Noir?

36:54.670 --> 36:56.071
- Mm, I'll do either.
- Okay.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.306
Hey, do you still...
You still play, Norma?

36:58.407 --> 36:59.574
- Piano?
- Yeah.

36:59.675 --> 37:02.477
Eh... you know, tinker
around a little bit.

37:02.578 --> 37:04.062
Play something for me.

37:05.948 --> 37:07.983
Go on.

37:08.084 --> 37:11.519
I hardly remember.

[slow individual notes]

37:15.191 --> 37:18.159

I remember you practicing
that on that old piano

37:20.263 --> 37:21.529
that we inherited.

37:21.631 --> 37:23.832
Half the keys stuck,
but you played it anyways.

Yeah.
