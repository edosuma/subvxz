<i>Kids, by the spring of 2013,</i>

00:04.326 --> 00:06.059
<i>Lily and Marshall had life</i>
<i>figured out;</i>

00:06.061 --> 00:09.929
<i>Lily was making a name as the</i>
<i>art consultant for The Captain,</i>

00:09.931 --> 00:12.665
<i>Marshall was a superstar</i>
<i>environmental lawyer</i>

00:12.667 --> 00:16.036
<i>and home life</i>
<i>was a well-oiled machine.</i>

00:16.038 --> 00:17.070
<i>And then...</i>

00:17.072 --> 00:18.955
<i>something changed.</i>

00:18.957 --> 00:22.008
(knocking)
Captain, you wanted to see me?

00:22.010 --> 00:24.327
Captain? Hello?

00:24.329 --> 00:26.463
Permission to come aboard?

00:26.465 --> 00:28.431
Granted.

00:28.433 --> 00:31.718
Lily, small order of business:
I'm moving to Rome

00:31.720 --> 00:33.520
and I'd like you to come
with me.

00:33.522 --> 00:34.521
Carry on.

00:34.523 --> 00:36.606
What?!
That-That-That's amazing,

00:36.608 --> 00:40.060
but I-I don't know if I can
just uproot my life.

00:40.062 --> 00:42.062
It's only for a year.
Carry on.

00:42.064 --> 00:43.530
But I'm married
and we have a baby

00:43.532 --> 00:46.366
and they just opened
a Shake Shack on our block

00:46.368 --> 00:47.767
and there's never a line!

00:47.769 --> 00:49.035
I understand
it's a big decision.

00:49.037 --> 00:50.453
Take all the time you need.

00:50.455 --> 00:52.872
Just let me know
by the end of the day.

00:52.874 --> 00:55.792
Also, I need your advice on
purchasing some luggage.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.727
What kind?
Carry on.

01:11.342 --> 01:13.426
Well, this has been fun.
I should go.

01:13.428 --> 01:15.228
But you literally just got here.

01:15.230 --> 01:16.779
I didn't "literally"
just get here.

01:16.781 --> 01:18.481
I hate when people misuse
that word.

01:18.483 --> 01:21.267
So do I.
But you literally just got here.

01:21.269 --> 01:23.820
Hey, Ted.

01:23.822 --> 01:25.805
Well, this has been fun.
I should go.

01:25.807 --> 01:27.940
Okay, fine, now I'm leaving.

01:27.942 --> 01:30.042
Why do people go
to a bar, anyway?

01:30.044 --> 01:32.778
To get your drink on
and some girl's pants off.

01:32.780 --> 01:34.613
I can do both at home.

01:35.883 --> 01:37.900
What are you looking at?

01:37.902 --> 01:39.118
The girl in the big coat?

01:39.120 --> 01:40.619
We were in
the same yoga class together.

01:40.621 --> 01:44.073
You know how sometimes you'll
meet a girl and there'll be

01:44.075 --> 01:46.225
that one bewitching little
detail that'll make you

01:46.227 --> 01:48.294
fall in love with her instantly?

01:48.296 --> 01:50.463
You know, a little freckle
on the nose,

01:50.465 --> 01:51.647
the-the lilt of her laugh,

01:51.649 --> 01:53.966
the way she pronounces
a certain word or phrase?

01:53.968 --> 01:55.801
Sure, totally.

01:55.803 --> 01:57.186
Well, in this girl's case,

01:57.188 --> 02:00.323
the bewitching little detail is
the fact

02:00.325 --> 02:03.476
that she has
just a "redonkulous" body.

02:03.478 --> 02:04.810
Redonkulous?

02:04.812 --> 02:06.028
Redonkulous!

02:06.030 --> 02:08.413
I've only heard you use
"redonkulous" to describe

02:08.416 --> 02:10.383
<i>Mission Impossible:</i>
<i>Ghost Protocol.</i>

02:10.384 --> 02:11.751
Barney, this girl has

02:11.753 --> 02:16.873
the <i>Mission Impossible:</i>
<i>Ghost Protocol</i> of bodies.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.708
Whoa.

02:18.710 --> 02:20.793
Just wait till she takes
that coat off.

02:20.795 --> 02:23.829
Oh, wait, sorry, you were
just about to leave, right?

02:23.831 --> 02:26.048
I mean, I've already paid
for this drink.

02:26.050 --> 02:30.303
Guys, The Captain just made me
a very interesting offer.

02:30.305 --> 02:32.855
Finally, we get around
to the real reason he hired you.

02:32.857 --> 02:35.391
Just promise you film it,
and please use a tripod.

02:35.393 --> 02:36.526
There's nothing artistic
about shaky-cam.

02:36.528 --> 02:38.060
It just looks sloppy.

02:38.062 --> 02:40.696
He wants me to move
to Rome for a year

02:40.698 --> 02:42.114
to buy art for him.

02:42.116 --> 02:43.282
Whoa! Seriously?

02:43.284 --> 02:45.117
Is that something you want to do?
Are you kidding?

02:45.119 --> 02:46.852
I've always wanted
to live abroad!

02:46.854 --> 02:50.456
My summer in Paris, back in
college, was so enlightening:

02:50.458 --> 02:53.859
the art, the history,
the free cheese

02:53.861 --> 02:55.495
just for wearing
a low-cut top.

02:55.497 --> 02:57.547
Well, how does Marshall feel
about moving?

02:57.549 --> 02:59.048
I haven't told him yet.

02:59.050 --> 03:00.866
He really loves
his job here.

03:00.868 --> 03:02.585
Yeah, but he also
loves Italy!

03:02.587 --> 03:04.837
He took a week
of Italian in college,

03:04.839 --> 03:07.006
and the only reason
he dropped it was

03:07.008 --> 03:09.642
'cause he had a conflict...
with being not stoned.

03:09.644 --> 03:12.762
But he still knows
how to say the phrase,

03:12.764 --> 03:15.765
"Come on, bro, don't Bogart
all the Funyuns."

03:16.533 --> 03:18.484
All right,
I'm gonna call him.

03:20.220 --> 03:21.437
Hey, baby.

03:21.439 --> 03:23.155
Hey, baby, I can't talk
right now.

03:23.157 --> 03:24.690
I'm working on a big case. Bye.

Oh, right. While you were

04:44.606 --> 04:46.138
about your whole life crisis
or whatever,

04:46.140 --> 04:48.807
I slipped Carl a hundred
to turn the heat up in here.

04:48.809 --> 04:49.909
What? Why?

04:49.911 --> 04:53.479
Because she is still
in the big puffy coat!

04:54.948 --> 04:55.831
Barney, what are
you doing?

04:55.833 --> 04:57.316
I'm trying her out of that coat,

04:57.318 --> 04:58.200
that's what I'm doing!

04:58.202 --> 04:59.452
I'm fighting hotness
with hotness!

04:59.454 --> 05:00.653
You're engaged.

05:00.655 --> 05:03.205
Okay, Lily, clearly you're
forgetting something.

05:03.207 --> 05:06.425
Yes, I'm engaged
to the coolest girl on Earth.

05:06.427 --> 05:08.260
This is about looking,
not touching.

05:08.262 --> 05:11.213
Robin understands there is one
set of balls she can't tie up

05:11.215 --> 05:14.216
with a necktie and lightly hit
with a Ping-Pong paddle.

05:14.218 --> 05:15.635
These balls.

05:15.637 --> 05:17.169
Okay, I'm gonna call
The Captain,

05:17.171 --> 05:19.505
get this over with.

05:20.840 --> 05:22.975
(phone rings)
Ahoy.

05:22.977 --> 05:23.809
Hello, Captain?

05:23.811 --> 05:26.011
Lily, I hope you're not calling

05:26.013 --> 05:27.863
to harpoon our big move
to Rome.

05:27.865 --> 05:31.867
Thank you, but I can't ask my
husband to abandon his career.

05:31.869 --> 05:33.852
Would you like me
to try and convince him?

05:33.854 --> 05:35.471
I'm very persuasive.

05:35.473 --> 05:37.523
I'm sorry, the ship has sailed.

05:37.525 --> 05:39.141
What's that mean?

05:39.143 --> 05:42.328
Well, you know,
"The ship has sailed"?

05:42.330 --> 05:44.380
That it's over and there's
nothing you can do?

05:44.382 --> 05:46.465
What a peculiar expression. Hmm.

05:46.467 --> 05:48.867
Well, thanks for all
your hard work, Lily.

05:48.869 --> 05:50.536
I've never been good at
good-byes, so...

05:52.005 --> 05:53.205
Well, that's that.

05:53.207 --> 05:55.925
My dream job as an
art consultant is over.

05:55.927 --> 05:57.093
And the sad part...

05:57.095 --> 05:59.044
Okay, I gotta stop you
right there, Lily,

05:59.046 --> 06:02.231
'cause unless I'm mistaken,
lock and load gentlemen.

06:04.518 --> 06:07.553
A scarf?! No, don't put on,
take off!

06:07.555 --> 06:09.555
Okay, you're
starting to drool.

06:09.557 --> 06:11.157
I'm calling creepy.

06:11.159 --> 06:12.074
Lily, it's fine.

06:12.076 --> 06:13.559
This is purely academic.

06:13.561 --> 06:16.195
It's-It's like bird-watching.

06:16.197 --> 06:19.448
And right now, I am watching
a double-breasted-- Robin!

06:22.902 --> 06:24.086
Wait-- they know
each other?!

06:24.088 --> 06:25.504
Whoa, wait--
what is going on here?

06:25.506 --> 06:27.456
Oh, my God,
it's happening.

06:27.458 --> 06:28.708
This is just like I imagined.

06:28.710 --> 06:31.761
Right in front of Ted,
so I can rub it in his face.

06:31.763 --> 06:32.911
The belt is mine!

06:32.913 --> 06:36.132
Hi, guys. Barney,
you remember Liddy.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.916
I do?

06:37.918 --> 06:40.136
Yes! Libby.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.021
Liddy. We met
when Robin hired me.

06:42.023 --> 06:42.972
Robin hired you?

06:42.974 --> 06:44.473
Naughty girl. Okay.

06:44.475 --> 06:46.475
Okay, so how's
this gonna go down?

06:46.477 --> 06:48.894
You two just gonna start,
and I'll just jump in?

06:48.896 --> 06:52.565
Uh, she's our
wedding planner.

06:52.567 --> 06:55.367
Of course
she's the wedding planner!

06:55.369 --> 06:57.203
Good to see you again, Libby.

06:57.205 --> 06:58.788
Liddy.
Yeah.

06:58.790 --> 07:02.241
Hey, I'm Ted.
We, uh, we met once before.

07:02.243 --> 07:04.460
Oh, right, in yoga class.
How are you?

07:04.462 --> 07:07.213
She's talking to me.

07:08.131 --> 07:09.582
Well, I would love
to stay,

07:09.584 --> 07:11.050
but now that
I'm unemployed,

07:11.052 --> 07:13.502
I think I'll go surprise
Marshall at work.

07:13.504 --> 07:16.639
(sighs)
Wedding planner.

07:18.091 --> 07:20.626
NARRATOR: <i>So Lily went</i>
<i>to visit Marshall at work,</i>

07:20.628 --> 07:22.394

07:22.396 --> 07:24.313
<i>She wasn't.</i>

07:24.315 --> 07:28.267

07:28.269 --> 07:30.703
Bernard, if we just glue
the cards together...

07:30.705 --> 07:33.305
Lily!
What are you doing here?

07:33.307 --> 07:34.490
Well, I baked you brownies

07:34.492 --> 07:36.809
because I thought
you were busy working, but...

07:36.811 --> 07:38.611
so when you said...

07:38.613 --> 07:40.079
Lily, hey, I can't really talk.

07:40.081 --> 07:42.164
I'm working on a big project
right now.

07:42.166 --> 07:43.532
It's a real house of cards.

07:43.534 --> 07:46.585
Is this the "house of cards"
you were talking about?

07:47.804 --> 07:50.005
I thought you had
some big client.

07:50.007 --> 07:53.509
Oh, sweetheart, we haven't had
a client here in months.

07:53.511 --> 07:56.545
Mmm! Brownies! Hey!

08:01.892 --> 08:03.504
What is going on?
What do you mean

08:03.505 --> 08:05.507
you haven't had
a client in months?

08:05.508 --> 08:07.292
Ever since the Gruber case,

08:07.294 --> 08:09.094
we lost a lot of business,

08:09.096 --> 08:12.414
people got laid off...
it's just me and Bernard now.

08:12.416 --> 08:13.482
Where's Cootes?

08:13.484 --> 08:15.717
He's holed up in a bomb shelter
in Colorado,

08:15.719 --> 08:18.636
waiting for the apocalypse and
tending to his herb garden.

08:18.638 --> 08:21.806
So all those times I've called
you in the past few months,

08:21.808 --> 08:24.943
when you talked
about how busy you were...

08:24.945 --> 08:26.528
you were just lying to me?

08:26.530 --> 08:29.030
Technically, I never lied...

08:30.449 --> 08:31.700
Hey, baby.

08:31.702 --> 08:33.335
Hey, baby, I can't talk
right now.

08:33.337 --> 08:35.921
I'm working on a big case. Bye.

08:39.325 --> 08:41.826
That <i>is</i> a big case.

08:42.628 --> 08:43.595
Bad time, Lily.

08:43.597 --> 08:45.013
I got to focus on the client.

08:45.015 --> 08:46.214
Gotta go. Bye.

08:47.216 --> 08:48.600
Where were we?

08:48.602 --> 08:50.018
Chapter 19.

08:50.020 --> 08:53.504
I can't talk right now;
I got a lot on my plate.

08:53.506 --> 08:55.724
Well, let's dig in.

08:55.726 --> 08:58.109
If we start now,
we can be done by lunch.

08:59.529 --> 09:00.896
Now's not a good time, Lil.

09:00.898 --> 09:04.316
We got a lot of balls
in the air right now.

09:04.318 --> 09:07.035
Okay, toss me
the stapler.

09:08.187 --> 09:09.905
Unbelievable.

09:09.907 --> 09:13.491
Wait-- when you said you were
about to get reamed...

09:13.493 --> 09:15.660
Oh, right. That.

09:15.662 --> 09:16.878
No, sometimes, for fun,

09:16.880 --> 09:18.997
We throw reams of paper
at each other.

09:18.999 --> 09:22.083
Bernard! Not a good time!

09:22.085 --> 09:24.669
Read the room!

09:24.671 --> 09:26.755
I'm sorry, baby, I...

09:26.757 --> 09:28.974
I didn't want you
to see me fail.

09:28.976 --> 09:32.844
Damn it! Do you realize what you
cost us by lying to me?

09:32.846 --> 09:34.479
The Captain is moving
to Rome,

09:34.481 --> 09:37.515
and he offered to bring me along
as his art consultant,

09:37.517 --> 09:40.185
but I turned it down, because
I thought you loved your job.

09:40.187 --> 09:42.070
Oh, my gosh.

09:42.072 --> 09:43.738
If we lived in Italy,

09:43.740 --> 09:46.074
I could just spend my days
taking care of Marvin

09:46.076 --> 09:50.228
and trying to make pasta and
watching Italian <i>Price Is Right.</i>

09:50.230 --> 09:51.780
It sounds like a dream!

09:51.782 --> 09:52.747
Oh, it's too late.

09:52.749 --> 09:54.232
No, no. Lily, I'm going

09:54.234 --> 09:55.617
to The Captain's right now!

09:55.619 --> 09:57.168
I'm gonna make this right!

09:57.170 --> 09:58.253
I'm gonna get
you that job!

09:58.255 --> 10:00.455
No, Marshall...
You're getting that job!

10:00.457 --> 10:02.908
You can just make it out
to Liddy Gates.

10:02.910 --> 10:04.843
That's L-I-D-D-Y.

10:04.845 --> 10:06.544
L-I, two D's...

10:06.546 --> 10:07.745
double D...

10:07.747 --> 10:10.265
two D's... -Y.

10:10.267 --> 10:12.884
Well, here is the final
menu, as we discussed,

10:12.886 --> 10:14.135
but let me be clear.

10:14.137 --> 10:15.804
You're the boss;
I'm here to serve you.

10:15.806 --> 10:17.806
So if there's anything
you want me to remove,

10:17.808 --> 10:19.724
just tell me to remove it
and it's gone.

10:19.726 --> 10:21.443
I'll remove
anything you want.

10:21.445 --> 10:23.061
That sounds like a sound policy.
Up to you, whatever you feel like.

10:23.063 --> 10:24.229
That's a good...
That's a good thing to know.

10:24.231 --> 10:26.032
That's fine, you can
remove whatever you want.

10:26.033 --> 10:28.433
I'm serious, and I won't be
offended; you want it gone,

10:28.435 --> 10:30.902
I'll take it right off.
Is it hot in here?

10:30.904 --> 10:32.570
It's not cold.
You know what?

10:32.572 --> 10:34.239
It's hot; it's sticky.
It's not... It's like

10:34.241 --> 10:35.940
Bikram, right?

10:35.942 --> 10:37.409
We're yoga buddies.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.961
♪ Yoga buddies.

10:39.963 --> 10:43.548
Well, I'll let you
guys read the menu.

10:43.550 --> 10:45.717
Can you point me to the...
GUYS: Coat rack?

10:45.719 --> 10:46.918
...restroom?

10:46.920 --> 10:48.803
Uh, it's right over there.

10:48.805 --> 10:50.972
But it's hard to pee
in a giant coat.

10:52.174 --> 10:53.425
Okay, what's going on?

10:53.427 --> 10:54.843
Why are you guys being
so weird?

10:54.845 --> 10:58.930
Ted says that Liddy has
a ridonkulous body,

10:58.932 --> 10:59.665
but there's no way of
verifying

10:59.690 --> 11:01.517
because she
won't take off the coat!

11:01.518 --> 11:03.101
Is that why
it's so hot in here?

11:03.103 --> 11:05.387
Did you pay Carl
to turn up the heat again?

11:05.389 --> 11:07.489
Well, yes.

11:07.491 --> 11:09.658
But I was curious.

11:09.660 --> 11:11.443
I want to get that
coat on the rack

11:11.445 --> 11:13.328
so I can see the rack
that's under the coat.

11:13.330 --> 11:14.579
My God.

11:15.448 --> 11:17.615
I have been wondering

11:17.617 --> 11:19.284
the same thing.

11:19.286 --> 11:21.202
I mean, she never takes
that coat off.

11:21.204 --> 11:22.537
Whatever she's smuggling
under there

11:22.539 --> 11:23.988
has to be thermonuclear.

11:23.990 --> 11:26.791
I bet she has WBDs.

11:27.460 --> 11:29.044
Weapons of bra destruction.

11:29.578 --> 11:30.661
Thank you.

11:30.663 --> 11:32.047
This, this is why

11:32.049 --> 11:34.265
you're the coolest
fiancée ever.

11:34.267 --> 11:36.267
(both moan, laugh)

11:36.269 --> 11:40.505
So, Ted, when you
say ridonkulous...

11:40.507 --> 11:42.190
I can't even describe it.

11:42.192 --> 11:45.860
It'd be like trying to explain
a rainbow to a blind person.

11:45.862 --> 11:47.512
Is she single?

11:47.514 --> 11:48.679
Why don't you ask her out?

11:48.681 --> 11:51.533
Actually, I almost did
the first time we met,

11:51.535 --> 11:54.953
before she took off that coat.

11:54.955 --> 11:56.187
Sandstorm?

11:56.189 --> 11:58.490
Dubai? That hoodie?

11:58.492 --> 12:00.041
I mean, it's ridonkulous.

12:00.043 --> 12:02.043
Oh, I know.
I so want to see it again.

12:02.045 --> 12:03.611
Well, hey, I mean,
maybe after this,

12:03.613 --> 12:04.796
if you're not doing anything.

12:04.798 --> 12:06.197
Totally, and maybe later,

12:06.199 --> 12:07.532
we could get a bite to eat.

12:07.534 --> 12:09.884
There's this great place
that's super close.

12:11.804 --> 12:12.754
No, I...

12:12.756 --> 12:14.055
No, I... No.

12:14.057 --> 12:15.640
It was just too much.

12:15.642 --> 12:18.760
Indiana Jones wouldn't look
at this body.

12:18.762 --> 12:22.347
This is a body
that would melt a Nazi's face.

12:22.349 --> 12:25.817
Oh, man, I want
my face to melt.

12:25.819 --> 12:28.386
(sighs) It's too bad
Marshall isn't here.

12:28.388 --> 12:29.788
Why Marshall?

12:29.790 --> 12:31.055
'Cause he could just say...

12:31.057 --> 12:32.123
Hey, Liddy,

12:32.125 --> 12:33.908
why don't you take
off that coat?

12:33.910 --> 12:35.026
BARNEY:
<i>And Liddy would be all...</i>

12:35.028 --> 12:36.611
Sure, should I take
my shirt off, too?

12:36.613 --> 12:38.029
No, the coat's
probably enough.

12:38.781 --> 12:40.081
And he'd get away with it.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.866
You know why? No stink.

12:41.868 --> 12:44.953
You obviously haven't split
a cab with him after basketball.

12:45.671 --> 12:46.737
No, I don't mean

12:46.739 --> 12:47.789
"physical stink."

12:47.791 --> 12:49.073
I mean the pheromonal stink

12:49.075 --> 12:51.509
a guy gives off when
he's desperate for action

12:51.511 --> 12:52.794
to a pathetic degree.

12:52.796 --> 12:54.412
You know, like Ted.

12:54.414 --> 12:55.580
I have stink?

12:55.582 --> 12:57.465
Bro, you dipped in stink.

12:57.467 --> 12:59.384
If Liddy came back to
the table and you said...

12:59.386 --> 13:00.468
Uh, Liddy,

13:00.470 --> 13:02.587
why don't you, uh,
take off that coat?

13:02.589 --> 13:03.754
You want me to take my coat off?

13:03.756 --> 13:05.390
How about instead,
I take off your face?

13:05.392 --> 13:06.591
Ow!

13:06.593 --> 13:07.725
Ow, oh!

13:07.727 --> 13:08.893
TED:
<i>Really?</i>

13:08.895 --> 13:10.612
You had to have her beat me up?

13:10.614 --> 13:11.896
She's not done, Ted.

13:11.898 --> 13:13.548
<i>Ghost Protocol</i>

13:13.550 --> 13:15.933
wasn't that good!

13:15.935 --> 13:17.135
(screams)

13:17.137 --> 13:18.570
Marshall, on the other hand,

13:18.572 --> 13:20.872
girls take one
look and just know

13:20.874 --> 13:23.708
there's a guy who's met
the girl of his dreams

13:23.710 --> 13:25.710
and wants to spend
the rest of his life

13:25.712 --> 13:27.295
with her and only her.

13:27.297 --> 13:28.913
So why don't you ask her?

13:28.915 --> 13:30.114
Pardon me?

13:30.116 --> 13:31.049
Aren't you

13:31.051 --> 13:32.383
a guy who's met

13:32.385 --> 13:34.252
the girl of his dreams
and wants to spend

13:34.254 --> 13:36.954
the rest of his life with her
and only her?

13:36.956 --> 13:39.757
Of course, baby.

13:39.759 --> 13:42.310
So why don't you ask her
to take her coat off?

13:44.814 --> 13:46.981
Um...

13:48.684 --> 13:51.603
And you never even
saw <i>Ghost Protocol.</i>

13:52.605 --> 13:54.272
So, the big day's
coming up.

13:54.274 --> 13:56.357
How are you guys feeling?

13:56.359 --> 13:57.692
I talked to the caterer,

13:57.694 --> 13:59.744
and the mini lamb shanks
are gonna be amazing.

13:59.746 --> 14:00.778
Oh, by the way,

14:00.780 --> 14:02.363
I talked to the florist,
and the violets

14:02.365 --> 14:04.282
are gonna be gorgeous.
BARNEY: <i>Okay, Barney. You can do this.</i>

14:04.284 --> 14:05.834
<i>Just say it. Say it.</i>

14:05.836 --> 14:07.252
...little ones and big ones...

14:07.254 --> 14:08.503
<i>Say it.</i>

14:08.505 --> 14:11.789
Hey, Liddy, do you want
to take off your coat?

14:16.595 --> 14:18.329
Sure.
(whimpers)

14:18.331 --> 14:20.849
<i>I did it! I proved to myself</i>
<i>and everyone else</i>

14:20.851 --> 14:23.268
<i>that I have no desire</i>
<i>to be with any other woman.</i>

14:23.270 --> 14:25.854
<i>I am completely immune</i>
<i>to every other...</i>

14:28.107 --> 14:30.141
<i>Holy crap!</i>

14:30.143 --> 14:33.194
(both panting)

14:33.196 --> 14:34.312
And it was, indeed,

14:34.314 --> 14:35.446
ridonkulous.

14:35.448 --> 14:38.149
And we got to see it,
all thanks

14:38.151 --> 14:39.567
to this lovely lady
right here.

14:39.569 --> 14:42.704
Robin, thanks to you,
I can now walk up to any girl

14:42.706 --> 14:45.123
and say whatever creepy,
disgusting thing I want

14:45.125 --> 14:46.457
and totally get away with it.

14:46.459 --> 14:47.525
Mm.
Man!

14:47.527 --> 14:49.827
I think I'm gonna
like being married.

14:49.829 --> 14:51.663
(phone rings)

14:51.665 --> 14:52.697
Hello?

14:53.449 --> 14:54.799
Ahoy.

14:54.801 --> 14:56.200
Ahoy, Lily.

14:56.202 --> 14:58.086
I just had a long talk
with your husband.

14:58.088 --> 15:00.922
He convinced me to offer you
that job in Rome again.

15:00.924 --> 15:02.473
How do you respond?

15:02.475 --> 15:07.262
Thanks,
but the answer is still no.

15:12.943 --> 15:16.005
Lily, why the hell did you
turn that down again.

15:16.030 --> 15:19.278
Because I 'd have to get
a new passport photo.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.874
And I'd miss out
on New York in August.

15:21.899 --> 15:24.301
Unless they open
the Shake Shop in a box.

15:24.326 --> 15:26.650
Lily, what's
the real reason?

15:27.879 --> 15:29.757
What if we moved to Rome...

15:36.143 --> 15:38.004
(laughing)

15:38.221 --> 15:39.618
What's so funny?

15:39.643 --> 15:40.781
I'm uh sorry.

15:40.830 --> 15:44.537
I can't believe you paid a
10 million euro this painting.

15:44.562 --> 15:45.462
Why not?

15:45.487 --> 15:46.855
This is not even a painting.

15:47.095 --> 15:49.491
I spin my plate, it's gonna
fill a blank canvas.

15:50.749 --> 15:51.981
It's like a toilet.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.467
It just make you look uh

15:54.828 --> 15:56.182
stupida.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.169
Lily, you're fired.
What?

15:58.194 --> 16:00.608
But no. I-I...it's still
a great painting.

16:00.633 --> 16:03.448
I like what it says about
the structure in society

16:03.473 --> 16:04.954
and the changing
worlds of women.

16:04.979 --> 16:06.878
(speaks Italian)

16:16.117 --> 16:18.816
I used to be
an art consultant.

16:27.280 --> 16:29.874
Hey baby. It's time for
Marvin's, uh, bottle.

16:31.193 --> 16:33.527
And it's all because
I screwed up and through away

16:33.552 --> 16:35.723
a perfectly comfortable
life here in New York.

16:35.748 --> 16:37.753
Lily, you're not going
to screw up.

16:37.802 --> 16:38.952
You know what, just please,

16:38.954 --> 16:40.269
just leave it alone.

16:40.271 --> 16:41.454
Besides,

16:41.456 --> 16:42.706
deep down, I don't think

16:42.708 --> 16:44.549
Marshall's even excited
about Italy.

16:44.574 --> 16:46.785
NARRATOR: <i>At that very moment</i>
<i>in little Italy.</i>

16:56.337 --> 16:58.555
(phone chirps)

17:03.277 --> 17:05.895
<i>Marron!</i>

17:05.896 --> 17:07.814
I can't wait for
my wedding day.

17:07.816 --> 17:09.683
I mean, there is no way

17:09.685 --> 17:12.652
that Liddy is gonna be wearing
that coat, right?

17:12.654 --> 17:13.737
Right?

17:13.739 --> 17:15.655
"Barney Stinson, do you hope

17:15.656 --> 17:17.857
she wears something slinky
and backless?"

17:17.858 --> 17:20.160
"I do."

17:21.278 --> 17:24.580
Okay, can I just say something
as your best man?

17:25.249 --> 17:26.532
Be careful.

17:26.535 --> 17:27.817
What do you mean?

17:27.819 --> 17:29.669
You just... you haven't
been acting like a guy

17:29.671 --> 17:31.988
who's about to get married,
and I know you think it's okay

17:31.990 --> 17:33.840
because Robin's so cool,
but I'm telling you,

17:33.842 --> 17:36.492
she's not as cool
as you think she is.

17:36.494 --> 17:39.112
Oh, I see.

17:39.114 --> 17:41.131
And you'd know this

17:41.133 --> 17:43.332
because you know Robin
better than I do.

17:43.334 --> 17:46.836
You know what she appreciates
better than her own fiancé.

17:46.838 --> 17:47.837
I'm just saying,

17:47.839 --> 17:49.355
if I was getting married
in three weeks...

17:49.357 --> 17:51.024
But you're not getting married
in three weeks, Ted.

17:51.026 --> 17:52.308
I am.

17:52.310 --> 17:54.561
Robin's marrying me, not you.

17:56.397 --> 17:58.148
You're right.

17:58.150 --> 17:59.783
Not my place.

17:59.785 --> 18:01.818
Why don't I get the next round?

18:07.074 --> 18:10.994
So... how many times are you
gonna say no to your dream job?

18:10.996 --> 18:12.929
I'm just trying
to plan my day.

18:12.931 --> 18:15.131
I'm a scaredy-cat, okay?

18:15.133 --> 18:16.499
I want to be the type

18:16.501 --> 18:18.534
of person that
just charges fearlessly

18:18.536 --> 18:20.170
into the unknown,

18:20.172 --> 18:22.472
but I came back
two weeks early from Paris

18:22.474 --> 18:24.007
because I was lonely.

18:24.009 --> 18:25.058
I went to San Francisco,

18:25.060 --> 18:29.212
and I was never more depressed
in my life.

18:30.314 --> 18:32.232
I'm small town, Marshall.

18:32.234 --> 18:35.218
I'm a hick from Brooklyn
who's terrified of living

18:35.220 --> 18:38.855
more than ten subway stops
from where I was born.

18:38.857 --> 18:42.075
Okay, Lily, if I can move
from St. Cloud, Minnesota,

18:42.077 --> 18:43.693
to New York City,

18:43.695 --> 18:45.728
then you can move to Rome.

18:45.730 --> 18:48.498
We know nothing about Italy.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.749
We have no friends there.

18:49.751 --> 18:51.400
We don't speak the language.

18:55.539 --> 18:58.091
Okay, so you know
that one sentence.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.575
Can you say anything else?

19:06.133 --> 19:07.416
That-that was the same sentence.

19:07.418 --> 19:09.752
You just changed the inflection.

19:49.810 --> 19:51.995
I love you, too.

19:51.997 --> 19:54.297
All right.

19:54.299 --> 19:55.431
We're going to Italy.

19:55.433 --> 19:57.317
<i>Si!</i>

19:58.435 --> 20:00.303
You may not know this yet,
but, um,

20:00.305 --> 20:02.822
I've already done some shopping.

20:13.221 --> 20:15.256
Welcome home.

20:17.042 --> 20:21.467
Oh... You are so cool,

20:24.210 --> 20:25.363
but not for long.

20:25.364 --> 20:30.363
