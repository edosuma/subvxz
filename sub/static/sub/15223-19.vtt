00:59.868 --> 01:02.534
Latka, nice threads.

01:02.567 --> 01:05.367
Oh? Thank you
very much.

01:05.400 --> 01:06.834
You like?

01:06.868 --> 01:08.434
You can keep.

01:10.634 --> 01:12.901
Hey, Latka, how come
you're so dressed up?

01:12.934 --> 01:16.100
Well, because my mother
is visiting today

01:16.133 --> 01:17.567
from the old country.

01:17.601 --> 01:18.734
Oh! Hey!
Oh! Hey!

01:18.767 --> 01:20.434
You must really be excited.

01:20.467 --> 01:21.467
When does her plane land?

01:21.501 --> 01:24.534
Right at the end of flight.

01:24.567 --> 01:27.601
Good, good, very good.

01:27.634 --> 01:30.567
She coming today
from the airport.

01:30.601 --> 01:31.801
She coming right here.

01:31.834 --> 01:33.767
Louie give me rest of day off

01:33.801 --> 01:37.701
so I could show her
around the Big Banana.

01:37.734 --> 01:40.634
Latka, I think you mean
The Big Apple.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.067
Oh, that, too.

01:43.100 --> 01:47.033
Latka, three cabs just
came in that need repairs.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.467
What are you doing in
these glad rags?

01:49.501 --> 01:51.567
Because you said
I could have the day off.

01:51.601 --> 01:54.133
Forget it, I got a garage
to run here.

01:54.167 --> 01:55.901
Yeah, but, Louie, you promised.

01:55.934 --> 01:58.467
Right, I promised,
now I'm breaking my promise.

01:58.501 --> 01:59.968
Get back to work.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.167
You are a nasty man.

02:02.200 --> 02:05.033
I'm not nasty.
A lot of guys

02:05.067 --> 02:06.701
wouldn't have given
you the day off

02:06.734 --> 02:08.834
in the first place.

02:08.868 --> 02:09.934
Go on, go on.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.601
Hey, come on, Louie.

02:11.634 --> 02:13.000
His mother's coming
to visit him.

02:13.033 --> 02:15.534
I'm not doing this
because I enjoy it.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.601
I do enjoy it,
but that's not the reason.

02:17.634 --> 02:20.834
Now get back to work!

02:20.868 --> 02:23.167
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

02:25.267 --> 02:27.267
I'll pretend
I didn't hear that.

02:30.234 --> 02:32.200
Hey, Latka.

02:32.234 --> 02:34.000
Very sorry about this.

02:34.033 --> 02:35.667
Is there anything
I can do to help?

02:35.701 --> 02:36.834
Yes.

02:36.868 --> 02:38.434
When my mama comes,

02:38.467 --> 02:40.734
you could take her
to Mario's for eat.

02:40.767 --> 02:41.901
I will come later.

02:41.934 --> 02:44.634
Oh. I, uh... I just got
off a 14-hour shift,

02:44.667 --> 02:46.634
and I-I thought I'd just go home
and try to get some sleep.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.801
Please, please, Alex.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.367
Poor little Mama,
she want to see America

02:50.400 --> 02:51.567
before she die.

02:51.601 --> 02:53.534
Latka, I'm sorry, I'd like to
help, but I'm really very tired.

02:53.567 --> 02:55.133
I mean, uh... Hey, wait
a minute, wait a minute.

02:55.167 --> 02:56.133
It's Tony's day off today.

02:56.167 --> 02:57.467
Hey, Tony, can I
ask you a question?

02:57.501 --> 02:58.167
Sure.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.200
Please.

03:00.033 --> 03:02.100
Mama, my mama!

03:02.133 --> 03:03.100
Oh, Latka.

03:03.133 --> 03:06.501
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

03:10.234 --> 03:12.634
What did you want
to ask me, Alex?

03:12.667 --> 03:14.334
Huh?

03:14.367 --> 03:15.701
Oh, how you doing?

03:17.167 --> 03:18.133
Good.

03:18.167 --> 03:19.634
Yeah, it was nice
talking to you.

03:19.667 --> 03:20.934
I think I got a date
for breakfast.

03:28.834 --> 03:30.767
What are you
going to have?

03:30.801 --> 03:32.834
Well, something
American.

03:32.868 --> 03:34.033
What have you?

03:34.067 --> 03:37.234
Uh, pizza, spaghetti, chili...

03:37.267 --> 03:40.934
and the special
of the day is chop suey.

03:40.968 --> 03:41.968
Yes.

03:43.367 --> 03:45.000
Why don't you bring us

03:45.033 --> 03:46.000
a couple of hamburgers, Tommy?

03:46.033 --> 03:48.167
Coming right up.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.434
So, Mrs. Gravas, when did
you get into New York?

03:51.467 --> 03:52.834
This morning.

03:52.868 --> 03:54.767
Have seen nothing.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.501
Hear much about
New York City.

03:57.534 --> 03:59.300
Oh?Many things want to see.

03:59.334 --> 04:00.467
Yeah? Like what?

04:00.501 --> 04:07.567
Oh, garbage strike,
blackout, urban blight.

04:07.601 --> 04:11.067
I'll find out when
the next tour is.

04:11.100 --> 04:14.634
Oh, also want to see
Yankee Dog Stadium.

04:14.667 --> 04:16.466
Oh, yeah.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.200
Yeah, you shouldn't miss that.

04:19.233 --> 04:20.767
You know, you talk
very good English.

04:20.801 --> 04:21.901
You, too.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.400
I learn English
from phrase book.

04:26.434 --> 04:29.000
Well, you learned
your phrases very well.

04:29.033 --> 04:30.601
Oh, you're welcome.

04:31.801 --> 04:33.467
Thank you.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.067
You're welcome.

04:37.968 --> 04:39.968
You're welcome from me, too.

04:42.367 --> 04:43.767
Oh, try this.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.667
No thirsty.

04:49.767 --> 04:53.367
Mrs. Gravas, I, um, I hope
this isn't too personal,

04:53.400 --> 04:55.234
but, uh, you know,
I was really very surprised

04:55.267 --> 04:56.400
to see how young you are.

04:56.434 --> 04:59.300
Oh, my, my, you're welcome.

04:59.334 --> 05:03.400
I marry Latka's father when 15.

05:03.434 --> 05:04.834
He killed two years later.

05:04.868 --> 05:06.234
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.200
Oh, you're welcome.

05:08.234 --> 05:11.667
He die in struggle
for liberty and freedom.

05:11.701 --> 05:14.133
Oh, he was a freedom fighter
shot by police?

05:14.167 --> 05:18.000
No, he was a police
shot by freedom fighter.

05:21.501 --> 05:24.968
I, uh, I just can't believe
that you never remarried.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.801
I mean, you really are a very,
uh, attractive woman.

05:27.834 --> 05:29.234
( <i>chuckling</i> )

05:29.267 --> 05:32.501
And you're a very nice man,
Mr. Reiger.

05:32.534 --> 05:34.200
( <i>chuckling</i> )

05:34.234 --> 05:37.000
Well, thank you, Mrs. Gravas.

05:37.033 --> 05:38.934
I am Greta.

05:40.934 --> 05:44.400
Okay, I'm Alex.

05:44.434 --> 05:46.067
Like Alexander?

05:46.100 --> 05:47.000
Right.

05:47.033 --> 05:51.167
( <i>cracking up</i> )

05:51.200 --> 05:52.734
( <i>laughing uneasily</i> )

05:54.234 --> 05:55.200
What?

05:55.234 --> 05:59.734
In my country, Alexander mean...

06:02.501 --> 06:06.234
...one who makes <i>nik-nik</i>
during harvest.

06:10.033 --> 06:12.033
Well, that's me all right.

06:13.701 --> 06:16.167
And, uh, what does Greta mean?

06:16.200 --> 06:18.667
Oh, means pretty.

06:18.701 --> 06:21.067
It fits.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.667
And yours fits, too.

06:27.767 --> 06:29.868
It's not even harvest. Ha, ha.

06:34.901 --> 06:35.868
Hi, everybody.

06:35.901 --> 06:37.033
Hi, Latka.
Hi.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.534
How are you, Mama?

06:38.567 --> 06:39.534
Mmm.

06:39.567 --> 06:40.868
( <i>speaking</i>
 <i>native language</i> )

06:40.901 --> 06:43.200
Mm. I can only
stay a minute

06:43.234 --> 06:45.434
because many cabs
are broke.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.767
Oh, Alex...

06:47.801 --> 06:51.767
this is for you--
two tickets to Rockettes.

06:51.801 --> 06:52.868
Mm.

06:52.901 --> 06:55.601
I was going to take Mama,
but, uh, so busy.

06:55.634 --> 06:57.300
Rockets?

06:57.334 --> 06:59.000
Oh, no, no, no.
Eh...

06:59.033 --> 07:01.634
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

07:01.667 --> 07:04.901
( <i>humming cancan music</i> )

07:06.734 --> 07:08.133
So you use them, Alex.

07:08.167 --> 07:09.734
Well, thank you
very much, Latka.

07:09.767 --> 07:11.868
Right. You can take girlfriend.

07:11.901 --> 07:13.968
What about your mother?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.400
She don't have a girlfriend.

07:16.434 --> 07:18.601
So tell me, Mama,

07:18.634 --> 07:20.000
how is Grishmel?

07:20.033 --> 07:23.033
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

07:28.400 --> 07:31.801
Oh, eh... and how is Triska?

07:31.834 --> 07:33.801
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

07:39.100 --> 07:40.367
Oh...

07:40.400 --> 07:42.501
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

07:42.534 --> 07:45.767
Eh, how is Schmopsy?

07:47.100 --> 07:49.634
Schmopsy <i>cookypoots.</i>

07:49.667 --> 07:52.467
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

07:55.033 --> 07:56.000
Oh.

07:56.033 --> 07:58.300
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

08:00.033 --> 08:01.834
How is Lurgid?

08:01.868 --> 08:05.834
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

08:07.968 --> 08:09.200
Oh!

08:12.634 --> 08:16.033
It's always nice to get
the news from home.

08:26.267 --> 08:27.868
How come every time
I get an apple

08:27.901 --> 08:29.801
out of the machine,
it's old and mushy?

08:29.834 --> 08:31.734
Don't they ever put any
new apples in this machine?

08:31.767 --> 08:34.033
Uh, yeah, they put new apples
in that machine,

08:34.067 --> 08:36.067
uh, but in order to get
to the new apples,

08:36.100 --> 08:38.200
you have to eat
the old apples first,

08:38.234 --> 08:39.534
be-because the old
apples are so old,

08:39.567 --> 08:41.000
very few people
eat them.

08:41.033 --> 08:43.033
So, by the time you get
to the new apples,

08:43.067 --> 08:45.534
they're old apples.

08:45.567 --> 08:48.801
So then all we gotta do

08:48.834 --> 08:50.934
is eat more apples.

08:50.968 --> 08:52.200
We'll eat right
through the old ones

08:52.234 --> 08:53.300
and get to the new ones.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.200
Except that

08:56.234 --> 08:58.400
if we all start
to eat the old apples,

08:58.434 --> 08:59.501
the apple man

08:59.534 --> 09:01.400
will think we like old apples

09:01.434 --> 09:04.033
and he'll never put
any new apples in the machine.

09:08.634 --> 09:10.968
So then how do we get
new apples, John?

09:11.033 --> 09:13.167
We can't.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.834
ALEX:
Hi.

09:17.367 --> 09:18.501
BOBBY:
Hey, Alex.

09:18.534 --> 09:20.367
How did your date go
with Latka's mama?

09:20.400 --> 09:21.634
It wasn't a date.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.133
Latka had these tickets
to a show,

09:23.167 --> 09:24.701
so I went and, uh, she went.

09:24.734 --> 09:26.267
It was sort of like,

09:26.300 --> 09:29.167
you know, uh, two people
being at the same place

09:29.200 --> 09:31.734
at the same time, uh,
together. That's all.

09:31.767 --> 09:34.067
Well, whatever it was,
how did it go?

09:34.100 --> 09:35.567
Fine, just fine.

09:35.601 --> 09:37.501
She sure is attractive.

09:37.534 --> 09:38.934
Who?

09:38.968 --> 09:40.701
Oh, Mrs. Gravas? Yeah.

09:40.734 --> 09:42.167
Gee, imagine
having a mother

09:42.200 --> 09:44.133
who's that
good-looking.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.567
You guys
talking about me?

09:46.601 --> 09:48.634
You?

09:48.667 --> 09:50.968
Yeah, my mom's good-looking.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.133
Very handsome
figure of a woman.

09:53.167 --> 09:56.734
If she'd just stop wearing those
black dresses all the time...

09:56.767 --> 09:58.067
shed a few pounds...

09:58.100 --> 10:00.434
get rid of the wart
and the mustache.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.033
Hi, guys.

10:03.067 --> 10:04.200
Hi.Hey.

10:04.234 --> 10:06.167
Hey, uh, Elaine,
you got a minute?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.200
Sure.

10:08.334 --> 10:10.767
Um, I want, I want
to ask you something.

10:10.801 --> 10:12.634
I, um...

10:14.467 --> 10:16.334
Elaine, listen.

10:16.367 --> 10:18.501
What would, uh...
what would you think of a guy

10:18.534 --> 10:22.167
who, uh...
kind of got friendly

10:22.200 --> 10:24.200
with the mother
of a buddy of his?

10:24.234 --> 10:26.000
Oh, that depends
how friendly.

10:26.033 --> 10:29.267
Shockingly friendly.

10:29.300 --> 10:32.267
Offhand, I'd say it was a
pretty crummy thing to do.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.267
No, no, wait,
now listen, um...

10:34.300 --> 10:35.934
What if, what if the
guy didn't plan it?

10:35.968 --> 10:38.767
You know what I mean? What if
it just sort of happened?

10:38.801 --> 10:42.534
In fact, what if the
mother, well, uh...

10:42.567 --> 10:45.334
forced herself on the guy?

10:45.367 --> 10:47.234
Forced herself?Yeah.

10:47.267 --> 10:48.501
I mean, what'd she do, like

10:48.534 --> 10:50.400
throw him down and pin him
to the floor?

10:52.634 --> 10:54.100
Kind of, yeah.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.968
Elaine, listen, uh...

10:57.000 --> 11:00.000
I'm talking about me
and Latka's mother.

11:00.033 --> 11:01.868
Latka's mother?!

11:04.667 --> 11:08.167
Uh... yeah. She flew in
yesterday from the old country.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.567
Just for that?

11:09.601 --> 11:11.968
Huh? No, no, no.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.467
She flew in to see Latka.

11:14.501 --> 11:17.834
Wow! You and
Latka's mother!

11:17.868 --> 11:19.334
Please.How old is she?

11:19.367 --> 11:20.901
About six-foot-three.

11:20.934 --> 11:23.334
Look, she-she happens to be
a very attractive woman.

11:23.367 --> 11:24.834
Look, Latka gave us
tickets to a show.

11:24.868 --> 11:26.400
We went to the
Radio City Music Hall,

11:26.434 --> 11:27.734
and afterwards out
for a bite to eat

11:27.767 --> 11:29.434
and she wanted to come up
to my place for a drink.

11:29.467 --> 11:30.501
Well, look,Oh, now...

11:30.534 --> 11:32.467
no, I had no idea
what was gonna happen.

11:32.501 --> 11:35.834
I mean, I don't think
she did either.

11:35.868 --> 11:38.667
Just one of those things,
you know what I mean?

11:38.701 --> 11:40.367
You mean,
you actually...

11:40.400 --> 11:42.601
Elaine, I couldn't help it.
I really couldn't help it.

11:44.133 --> 11:47.367
After we were alone for a while,
she turned into an animal.

11:48.801 --> 11:50.033
A great one.

11:53.801 --> 11:55.067
She started to rip my shirt.

11:55.100 --> 11:56.067
She ripped my raincoat.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.667
Latka's mother?!

11:57.701 --> 11:58.767
Quiet, will you?

11:58.801 --> 12:00.100
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.767
Look, there-there's no reason
for you to feel guilty.

12:02.801 --> 12:04.133
I don't, but it just
bothers me that

12:04.167 --> 12:06.267
if Latka found out about it,
it would really hurt him.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.367
Oh, well, that's simple.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.367
If I were you, I'd just make
sure he never finds out.

12:11.400 --> 12:12.400
Hmm.

12:12.434 --> 12:13.767
LATKA:
Alex?

12:14.601 --> 12:16.234
Alex Reiger?

12:20.734 --> 12:23.033
If I were you,
I'd think of
something else.

12:27.367 --> 12:28.767
Um...

12:28.801 --> 12:34.067
Alex, I must talk
to you man-to-face.

12:34.100 --> 12:35.100
Yes.

12:36.834 --> 12:38.467
Yes, Latka.

12:38.501 --> 12:42.033
Last night, Mama
come home very late.

12:42.067 --> 12:43.701
Yes, I-I know. I know.

12:43.734 --> 12:45.934
And I ask her
where she been.

12:45.968 --> 12:47.834
She did not
want to tell me,

12:47.868 --> 12:49.267
but I make her.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.234
She told you everything?

12:51.267 --> 12:53.100
Everything.

12:53.133 --> 12:55.901
Oh, listen, Latka,
please, I can explain.

12:55.934 --> 12:59.267
You don't need
to explain... Daddy.

13:08.801 --> 13:10.834
I think we really have
to talk about this, Latka.

13:10.868 --> 13:13.200
You know, Alex,
if there was anyone

13:13.234 --> 13:15.133
in the world for me
to choose for my father,

13:15.167 --> 13:16.133
I would choose you.

13:16.167 --> 13:18.400
Oh, well, that's
really very nice.

13:18.434 --> 13:21.334
Latka, come over here
and pick up your work order.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.067
Okay, coming, Louie.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.100
See you later, Papa.

13:27.701 --> 13:30.934
Hey, Alex, you and Latka's
mother getting serious?

13:30.968 --> 13:32.334
Of course not.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.968
Hello, Alexander.

13:38.067 --> 13:40.033
It's not what
you're thinking.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.067
No, it's probably
a lot better.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.934
Uh, You guys got
something better to do?

13:45.968 --> 13:46.601
No.

13:46.634 --> 13:47.734
Then do it!

13:50.200 --> 13:53.300
We are going to be
so happy together.

13:53.334 --> 13:57.467
Mama cook, Alex read paper,
I mow the lawn, oh...

you speak?

14:05.000 --> 14:05.968
I no marry Alex.

14:06.000 --> 14:06.968
No, no, no,

14:07.000 --> 14:08.968
Look, Latka, your mother's
is a wonderful woman,

14:09.000 --> 14:10.834
but I... I don't
want to marry her.

14:10.868 --> 14:14.767

But, Mama, if you play

14:22.501 --> 14:24.801
then you must marry.

14:24.834 --> 14:27.667

to save the family honor.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.501
Oh, goat droppings.

No marry.

No goat

Yes.

15:31.834 --> 15:33.701
Oh, uh, what did you tell him?

15:33.734 --> 15:35.868
She told me how
lonely she'd been

15:35.901 --> 15:37.801
since father died

15:37.834 --> 15:39.400
and I forgive her.

15:39.434 --> 15:41.968
Hey, that's terrific, Latka.

15:42.000 --> 15:44.200
But you, Mr. Reiger,

15:44.234 --> 15:46.734
you, I never forgive.

Latka, Latka.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.300
Look!

16:09.334 --> 16:12.367
I don't know what's exactly
going on here, Reiger,

16:12.400 --> 16:14.667
and I don't want
to make a judgment

16:14.701 --> 16:17.133
about who's right
and who's wrong.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.534
But I just want you
to remember one thing:

16:19.567 --> 16:22.100
My mother's
off-limits.

17:16.834 --> 17:18.800
Hello, Latka.

17:18.834 --> 17:19.834
Hello.

17:21.032 --> 17:23.666
I was looking
all over for you.

17:23.701 --> 17:24.968
That so?

17:27.400 --> 17:28.834
How you doing?

17:28.868 --> 17:30.701
What's it to me?

17:35.167 --> 17:36.234
Can I sit down?

17:36.267 --> 17:37.767
Free country.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.834
Latka, I think
we have to talk.

17:43.868 --> 17:45.701
I know what you're
going to say.

17:45.734 --> 17:47.801
( <i>speaking native language</i> )

17:50.968 --> 17:54.267
I wanted to say that, um...

17:54.300 --> 17:55.634
I'm deeply sorry

17:55.667 --> 17:57.267
that you were hurt
by what happened

17:57.300 --> 17:58.501
between your mother and me.

17:58.534 --> 17:59.868
I knew it.

18:01.534 --> 18:04.434
Look, Latka, what your mother
and I did was indiscreet.

18:04.467 --> 18:08.567
You mean,
not even indoors?

18:08.601 --> 18:10.033
No, no, no, no, no.

18:10.067 --> 18:15.033
Latka, look, what
I'm trying to say is

18:15.067 --> 18:17.033
that I know through your eyes

18:17.067 --> 18:19.701
what happened between
your mother and me was wrong.

18:19.734 --> 18:20.901
But what happened between

18:20.934 --> 18:24.200
a woman by the name of Greta
Gravas and me was not wrong.

18:31.234 --> 18:32.234
May I?

18:36.434 --> 18:39.601
( <i>grunting</i> )

No, eats... eats the pipes.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.901
Oh!

18:52.767 --> 18:55.367
Look, Latka, Latka,
what do you say...

18:55.400 --> 18:56.934
What do you say
we just shake hands, okay?

18:56.968 --> 18:58.300
Okay.

18:58.334 --> 18:59.767
Then we're
friends again?

18:59.801 --> 19:02.634
No, no, not friends.

19:02.667 --> 19:04.567
We just shook hands,
that makes us friends,

19:04.601 --> 19:05.567
doesn't it?

19:05.601 --> 19:06.968
Not in my country.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.434
Only one thing means
friendship between two men--

19:09.467 --> 19:11.801
when they do this
to each other.

19:16.100 --> 19:17.167
I guess that seems

19:17.200 --> 19:20.033
a lot friendlier
than shaking hands.

19:20.067 --> 19:22.100
Latka, why can't
you forgive me?

19:22.133 --> 19:24.701
Because you have shamed
the name of Gravas.

19:24.734 --> 19:26.767
Was it that bad?

19:26.801 --> 19:28.367
Look, why you do this?

19:28.400 --> 19:30.334
I would not do it
to your mother.

19:30.367 --> 19:31.868
My mother's 67 years old.

19:31.901 --> 19:35.501
Then not do for sure.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.534
Latka, look, I like you.

19:39.567 --> 19:41.467
I... to be friends
with you again.

19:41.501 --> 19:43.501
Well, I like you,
too, Alex,

19:43.534 --> 19:45.200

be friends.

We work in the same place.

We see each other every day.

19:48.634 --> 19:50.133
Come on, you'll
get over this.

19:50.167 --> 19:51.934
Of course we can
be friends again.

19:51.968 --> 19:53.801
No.

19:55.300 --> 19:57.467
You mean to say that we'll
never go to breakfast

19:57.501 --> 19:58.734
with each other ever again?

19:58.767 --> 20:00.400
Never.

20:01.601 --> 20:05.334
We'll never be able to play
poker together ever again?

Never.

we cannot be friends.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.934
It's a question of honor.

Without honor, a man is nothing.

20:29.434 --> 20:32.767
I'm sorry, but this
is how it must be.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.801
There's nothing I can
do to change that?

20:36.834 --> 20:38.367
Nothing.

that's it, then.
