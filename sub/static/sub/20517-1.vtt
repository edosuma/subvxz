00:45.712 --> 00:48.464
There is nothing more noble

00:48.590 --> 00:51.884
than a family coming together
in the face of death...

00:54.929 --> 00:58.599
despite their busy schedules.

00:58.933 --> 01:03.437
Ma is putting in extra hours
swindling a housewife

01:03.563 --> 01:06.440
who's tired of rotting away
in her suburban mansion.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.400
...figure out who made me this way.

01:09.819 --> 01:12.071
We'll talk more about it next week.

01:13.114 --> 01:14.865
That’ll be $1 25.

01:14.991 --> 01:18.285
Uncle Fred is furthering his quest
to give back to society

01:18.411 --> 01:21.747
by acting as a guinea pig
for pharmaceutical research.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.666
"May cause memory loss,

01:24.793 --> 01:28.170
"incontinence, drowsiness, bleeding,

01:28.296 --> 01:30.589
"and priapism."

01:30.715 --> 01:31.965
What's that?

01:33.134 --> 01:35.677
What are you testing?

01:36.096 --> 01:39.389
A new disease,
so we can develop a cure for it.

01:39.974 --> 01:41.266
Makes sense.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.689
Dolorès...

01:47.816 --> 01:50.109
Sorry I'm late!

01:50.235 --> 01:52.736
Hey! Where's your baby?

01:53.154 --> 01:54.822
Shit! I left him in the car!

01:54.948 --> 01:57.491
...a true sex tycoon,

01:57.617 --> 02:00.828
has just launched
her own adult specialty channel:

02:00.954 --> 02:02.496
The Vas Deferens Network.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.499
Catch all the action on VD!

02:06.584 --> 02:08.252
Oh yeah!

02:09.002 --> 02:10.711
If this isn't ass, what is?

02:14.008 --> 02:18.971
Chabot, a loyal friend
who would never abandon his old pal.

02:19.097 --> 02:22.099
Only the good die young.

02:22.225 --> 02:25.561
Mao, who only speaks
when it really counts.

02:25.687 --> 02:28.605
- Why?
- Because he had cirrhosis.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.066
I know, but why?

02:32.777 --> 02:34.027
Oh, shit!

02:34.904 --> 02:37.739
These god damn Chinese Ben Wa balls!

02:37.866 --> 02:39.158
I'm sorry.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.618
I knew I should have
gotten the American ones.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.328
Chinese men have small penises,

02:43.454 --> 02:46.373
so it makes sense
that the women have small va-jay-jays.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.749
OK, let's go.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.917
Sorry.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.880
Well? We're in a funeral home.
Aren't you forgetting something?

02:53.006 --> 02:54.548
I'm not in the mood. Junior?

02:54.674 --> 02:55.716
And Junior...

02:55.842 --> 02:56.925
Come on, Dad!

02:57.051 --> 02:59.303
It's all right.
I'll go with him.

02:59.429 --> 03:04.266
Oh, Junior, always making sacrifices
for the family.

03:04.392 --> 03:08.562
No! It can't be!
It just can't be!

03:08.688 --> 03:12.983
Why'd you have to go?
It just ain't right!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.903
- No!
- Come on.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.654
I'll miss your smell!

03:17.780 --> 03:20.866
- You can cry at home.
- One more minute!

03:20.992 --> 03:22.784
- Come on.
- One more minute!

03:22.911 --> 03:24.745
Oh, the pain!

03:28.958 --> 03:30.042
Well, it ain't much!

03:30.168 --> 03:31.543
Yeah. Oh, hold on!

03:38.134 --> 03:39.509
So?

03:55.777 --> 03:57.027
Get inside!

04:05.828 --> 04:08.038
All right, Daddy's coming.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.792
Come on, you mutts!
Time for breakfast!

04:15.964 --> 04:17.380
Hungry?

04:18.216 --> 04:19.841
You're making me breakfast?

04:20.677 --> 04:23.971
No, I wasn't talking to you.
I was asking Sophie and Justin.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.891
God dammit!

04:28.393 --> 04:30.894
Dodo, stop playing with the food!

04:31.020 --> 04:32.521
Sorry!

04:34.148 --> 04:36.108
Where did she stick that thing?

04:36.776 --> 04:38.026
Here, Sophie.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.071
No, not there. Look! Eat up.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.572
Paul...

04:43.491 --> 04:45.826
We haven't done anything together
in a while.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.202
What do you mean?

04:47.328 --> 04:49.079
We eat together.
We sleep together.

04:49.205 --> 04:51.248
We get on
each other's nerves together.

05:00.508 --> 05:03.844
We need to talk, right now.

05:09.100 --> 05:10.767
Bougon, I need to talk to you.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.896
What's up, Chabot?

05:15.398 --> 05:17.149
I just shot a homeless guy.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.692
You poor thing!

05:19.319 --> 05:22.237
It was in self-defence:
the guy freak'n stank.

05:23.865 --> 05:26.074
Six months paid leave.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.128
- Hello, Rita.
- Hello.

05:46.346 --> 05:47.804
...put me in the union.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.181
Paul, listen to this!

05:50.058 --> 05:52.934
"Priapism: a condition characterized

05:53.061 --> 05:56.980
"by prolonged and often painful
erection of the penis...

05:57.982 --> 06:00.275
"not associated
with sexual arousal."

06:02.445 --> 06:04.446
I was starting to worry.

06:05.031 --> 06:08.742
I was picturing our city mayor nude
to get rid of this thing.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.953
- Listen, Dolorès!
- Come on!

06:12.080 --> 06:14.289
I'm telling you!
As soon as I get the money...

06:14.415 --> 06:15.874
Whatever!

06:19.629 --> 06:22.297
Isn't that what's-his-name,
the famous writer?

06:22.423 --> 06:24.091
Really? What's he written?

06:24.217 --> 06:26.093
He's not a writer who writes.

06:26.219 --> 06:29.721
He uses his imagination to make
people believe he'll get paid.

06:30.765 --> 06:32.432
Of course he'll get paid!

06:32.558 --> 06:34.601
He won in the Supreme Court!

06:37.397 --> 06:41.441
Uh, Uncle, just like
when a client comes in my hair,

06:41.567 --> 06:43.485
what you're saying
is hard to swallow.

06:43.611 --> 06:47.697
Well, he still proved
that our justice system works.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.574
Bullshit!

06:50.034 --> 06:52.661
If you think losing 20 years
of your life,

06:52.787 --> 06:54.204
your health and your money

06:54.330 --> 06:57.916
to win in court
and not end up with a single cent

06:58.042 --> 06:59.876
shows that the system works,

07:00.002 --> 07:03.171
then you should be very proud
of our justice system!

07:03.589 --> 07:06.508
Why'd you bring him here anyway?
You have a business now.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.677
Some people like home made ketchup,

07:08.803 --> 07:11.263
others like home made cumshots!

07:12.807 --> 07:15.725
Shit! Whenever I laugh,
these things fall right out!

07:18.646 --> 07:20.021
Do you still love me?

07:24.026 --> 07:25.735
What? You know I do.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.947
No, I don't. I want you to say it.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.951
- What?
- Do you love me?

07:48.759 --> 07:50.010
It's for you.

07:52.013 --> 07:53.263
Yeah?

07:53.389 --> 07:55.765
What? You want me to come right now?

07:57.518 --> 08:00.145
OK, I'm on my way.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.521
Christ.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.150
It's Gagnon. He needs to see me.

08:05.818 --> 08:10.071
- Sure! It's Gagnon!
- Yeah, it's too bad.

08:12.783 --> 08:14.242
It's Gagnon!

08:16.746 --> 08:19.498
I was invited to be on
Sunday's episode of High Mass.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.459
Nothing's happening in the news,

08:22.793 --> 08:25.879
so they're celebrating
the anniversary of Bill 1 1 2.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.380
What's that?

08:27.507 --> 08:29.090
An act to eliminate poverty.

08:29.217 --> 08:30.592
It wasn't passed?

08:30.718 --> 08:32.135
Yeah, it was, a while ago.

08:32.260 --> 08:35.679
It aims to eliminate poverty,
but it didn't say when.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.515
And so it goes...

08:38.976 --> 08:41.811
I'd like you to go on the show
in my place.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.397
Are you crazy, Gagnon?

08:45.024 --> 08:48.068
You're the president of
Save Quebeckers on Welfare.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.570
Since the papers announced

08:50.696 --> 08:53.573
that I earn $250,000 a year
defending the poor,

08:53.908 --> 08:55.867
I've been trying to keep
a low profile.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.202
Some people got mad.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.079
It's not really my thing.

08:59.705 --> 09:01.581
Let's be honest, Paul.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.625
People on welfare are idiots.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.961
Most of them can't go on ΤV.

09:06.087 --> 09:09.130
Just show them your big doe eyes

09:09.257 --> 09:11.758
and speak in
your sweet country accent.

09:11.884 --> 09:17.264
You're the perfect embodiment
of the pathetic ordinary man.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.558
No.

09:42.331 --> 09:43.707
You'll be great.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.543
Τhis is television!

09:48.546 --> 09:51.715
Places, everyone!
We're starting in two minutes!

09:53.175 --> 09:55.218
Use this time
to shatter the stereotypes

09:55.344 --> 09:57.387
that keep Quebec's poor down.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.765
Don't put on a snooty accent
and make us look all pretentious.

10:00.891 --> 10:04.686
- Yes, but at the same time, Rita--
- Fred, this is Quebec!

10:04.812 --> 10:08.231
Whatever you do,
don't cross your arms. OK, Dad?

10:08.357 --> 10:10.900
It's true. Non-verbal communication
is important.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.070
Τhat's not it. I don't want him
to hide my Τ-shirt.

10:14.196 --> 10:18.491
Τhis is great
fucking advertising!

10:18.618 --> 10:20.327
Shit!

10:20.453 --> 10:22.454
Your damn Chinese balls!

10:22.580 --> 10:25.498
I can't feel anything otherwise.
Where did they go?

10:25.625 --> 10:28.251
One of these days,
someone's going to slip on those

10:28.377 --> 10:29.878
and crack their head open.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.839
Found one!

10:35.968 --> 10:37.969
Thanks, Junior!

10:38.095 --> 10:39.512
No problem.

10:59.325 --> 11:01.326
Hey, Barack!
What do you say?

11:01.452 --> 11:05.288
Knock it off with your 1 950's
"please and thank you's."

11:05.414 --> 11:07.040
I don't want him to be a loser.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.000
Paul Bougon, on in 1 0 seconds.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.837
Two million people
will be watching you, Dad.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.964
Just don't think about it.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.676
- Right.
- Paul Bougon, on in five.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.058
Welcome to High Mass.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.230
Without the poor, how would the rich
know they're rich?

11:30.731 --> 11:34.818
Despite his odour, our first guest
is a breath of fresh air!

11:34.944 --> 11:37.862
Please welcome Paul Bougon!

11:37.988 --> 11:40.240
Big fat pig

11:40.366 --> 11:42.701
Big fat pig

11:42.827 --> 11:44.160
Big fat pig

11:46.831 --> 11:49.708
No one knew
just where he was from

11:49.834 --> 11:51.376
But we had a feeling he...

11:51.502 --> 11:54.587
Paul Bougon,
thank you for being here.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.298
But it's not like
you had anything else to do!

11:58.259 --> 11:59.759
I don't know about that.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.555
Τhis week marks the anniversary
of Bill 1 1 2.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.473
What is it exactly?

12:05.599 --> 12:07.684
It's an act to eliminate poverty.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.060
But it wasn't passed.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.062
Yeah, it was passed a while ago.

12:11.772 --> 12:14.274
Let's play "If I Were..."

12:21.073 --> 12:25.243
Paul Bougon, if welfare recipients
were flowers,

12:25.369 --> 12:27.495
what kind of flower would they be?

12:28.664 --> 12:32.250
They’d be dandelions, because no one
wants them on their property!

12:41.594 --> 12:43.887
Τhis will be better
after it's edited.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.557
Τhank you, Paul.
Will you stick around?

12:47.683 --> 12:48.641
Great!

12:48.768 --> 12:53.438
My next guest started out with
the Capitalist Workers' Party.

12:53.564 --> 12:56.649
He then moved over to
the Liberal Party of Canada,

12:56.776 --> 12:58.902
followed by a stint
with the Conservatives

12:59.028 --> 13:00.779
and another with the separatists

13:00.905 --> 13:03.364
before being elected
under the NDP banner.

13:03.783 --> 13:06.034
Please welcome Gratien Τherrien!

13:06.160 --> 13:07.786
Chameleon

13:08.704 --> 13:11.080
I change colours all the time

13:11.207 --> 13:13.875
I hang out in bars and saloons

13:14.001 --> 13:16.586
With lowlifes and cretins

13:18.839 --> 13:20.340
Assassins and...

13:20.466 --> 13:22.091
- Hello, Μr. Τherrien.
- Hello.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.511
So, in this latest campaign,

13:24.637 --> 13:27.013
you're with the provincial Liberals.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.808
Only a fool
never changes his mind!

13:29.934 --> 13:31.810
Over the course of your career,

13:31.936 --> 13:36.481
you've been accused of
influence peddling, perjury,

13:36.941 --> 13:38.733
electoral fraud, collusion,

13:38.859 --> 13:41.236
obstruction of justice,
tax evasion...

13:41.362 --> 13:42.320
Jesus Christ!

13:42.446 --> 13:44.364
...triple billing and corruption.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.950
I've always been active in politics.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.869
You've been criticized
for links to organized crime.

13:49.995 --> 13:51.204
Let me stop you there.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.290
You're focusing on the "crime"
in "organized crime."

13:54.416 --> 13:57.418
I'd like to focus
on the word "organized."

13:57.545 --> 14:00.630
Would you rather live
in anarchy, in chaos,

14:00.756 --> 14:02.215
in a disorganized world?

14:02.341 --> 14:05.677
I think I speak for everyone
when I say I wouldn't!

14:09.890 --> 14:13.268
Well, there are no more questions
on my cue cards.

14:13.644 --> 14:16.563
So, thank you, Μr. Τherrien.
Will you stick around?

14:16.689 --> 14:18.189
Yes. Τhank you.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.733
My next guest--

14:21.569 --> 14:23.820
You're not going
to press him on that?

14:24.238 --> 14:26.364
Do you have something to add,
Mr. Bougon?

14:26.490 --> 14:29.826
Τhis is where your grandpa
puts that crook in his place.

14:29.952 --> 14:31.327
Check this out, Barack!

14:31.453 --> 14:32.787
I have something to add.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.414
Let's talk about corruption.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.542
Not too much though,
'cause if I don't kiss their asses,

14:37.668 --> 14:39.419
politicians won't come on my show.

14:39.545 --> 14:42.672
Let's talk about corruption
and impunity for crooks like you.

14:42.798 --> 14:45.300
If we start putting politicians
in prison,

14:45.426 --> 14:47.468
no one will want
to go into politics.

14:47.595 --> 14:50.638
in some places, you get arrested
for criticizing the system.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.224
Here, those within it
should rot in jail.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.561
Let's get some
applause going, buddy!

14:56.687 --> 14:58.271
Come on, louder!

15:01.942 --> 15:05.486
You people need to stop
doing what you're told.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.697
You're only helping this asshole.

15:08.115 --> 15:11.951
Your head isn't just a place
to put piercings. Use it!

15:12.077 --> 15:15.079
Do you have any solutions
to society's problems?

15:15.205 --> 15:17.206
Because we all know
there aren't any.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.168
Τhe solution is to get rid
of people who think that way.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.588
To succeed, you have to believe
change is possible.

15:23.714 --> 15:26.633
Well, my good sir,
if you're not happy,

15:26.759 --> 15:28.801
all you have to do
is go into politics.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.387
Well, I'm going to start
my own political party!

15:31.513 --> 15:35.058
And if everyone who's fed up
with you nitwits votes for me, I'll win!

15:35.184 --> 15:37.852
What refreshing honesty
from a welfare recipient!

15:37.978 --> 15:40.772
Now I think I speak
for the silent majority

15:40.898 --> 15:42.941
when I say enough with the cynicism!

15:43.067 --> 15:46.361
You're not even creative enough
to lift yourself out of poverty,

15:46.487 --> 15:48.905
and you think you can solve
Quebec's problems?

15:49.031 --> 15:50.448
Let me tell you something:

15:50.574 --> 15:52.241
it takes a lot of creativity

15:52.368 --> 15:56.871
to pay your rent, your bills
and buy food on $623 a month!

15:56.997 --> 16:00.333
I manage a tighter budget
than any damn minister!

16:00.459 --> 16:04.045
So don't talk to us
about creativity, you crook!

16:08.842 --> 16:10.009
Μr. Bougon!

16:10.135 --> 16:12.011
What?

16:14.223 --> 16:15.306
Μr. Τherrien!

16:16.308 --> 16:17.642
Let me go.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.602
After the break,

16:19.728 --> 16:23.398
we've got the winner
of the reality ΤV show Pussy Party :

16:23.524 --> 16:27.860
woman-of-the hour Marina Snatch,
who sings through her vagina.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.988
- You did great, big guy.
- Yeah!

16:30.114 --> 16:31.447
I wasn't that good.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.783
I've never seen anything like this.

16:33.909 --> 16:34.867
What?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.869
Dad is blowing up on social media.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.163
Oh yeah? What are
the social people saying?

16:39.289 --> 16:42.875
A shit ton of people are saying
that if Dad was running,

16:43.002 --> 16:44.502
they'd vote for him.

16:44.920 --> 16:47.797
You have the charisma
to be in politics.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.132
You could save Quebec.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.300
- Come on!
- We're crooks.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.053
We're interested in making money,
not politics.

16:54.179 --> 16:57.473
If there was any money in politics,
it'd be full of croo...

16:59.435 --> 17:02.270
Exactly. What do you think, big guy?

17:02.396 --> 17:05.064
I don't look like a politician.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.648
Τhat's not what I mean.

17:07.067 --> 17:10.444
We could start
a small political party,

17:10.570 --> 17:14.824
sell membership cards,
ask for donations...

17:24.917 --> 17:27.420
I can totally see it!

17:27.546 --> 17:29.630
Τhe critics at Jerk Off Magazine

17:29.757 --> 17:34.469
gave the vagina singer
five stars for her depth.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.846
Not only can she sing
through her vagina,

17:36.972 --> 17:38.473
she can piss out her mouth!

17:38.599 --> 17:41.392
Electoral law
is really something, Paul.

17:41.518 --> 17:44.562
Τhey don't want regular people
getting involved in politics.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.065
OK, everyone! Listen up!

17:47.191 --> 17:49.734
I've made our first campaign poster.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.487
VOTE BOUGON
PARTY FOR ΤHE ERADICATION OF NITWITS

17:52.613 --> 17:54.405
Not bad, huh?

17:54.531 --> 17:55.948
Τhe PEN?

17:56.075 --> 17:57.575
Τhat's right, PEN:

17:57.701 --> 17:59.952
Party for the Eradication
of Nitwits.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.288
Come on!

18:02.414 --> 18:05.249
Τhat means that our members will be...

18:05.375 --> 18:06.667
Penists!

18:07.961 --> 18:09.170
Pretty good, right?

18:11.840 --> 18:14.675
And you'll be the party hardliner!

18:21.266 --> 18:22.809
Come on, it's called the PEN.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.812
You must like that.
No? Not your thing?

18:25.938 --> 18:26.896
Hey, you!

18:27.022 --> 18:29.398
Wanna check out
the church basement with me?

18:29.525 --> 18:30.817
Vote PEN!

18:36.740 --> 18:38.449
Are you gonna start, big guy?

18:38.575 --> 18:40.118
Τhere's no one here.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.287
Τhere will be even fewer
if you don't say anything.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.540
Shit!

18:50.087 --> 18:54.048
My friends, the PEN is pumped up
and ready to go.

18:54.550 --> 18:58.219
My wife will be selling memberships
and collecting donations.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.471
If you wanna party with this,

19:00.597 --> 19:02.306
you might like my party too!

19:02.432 --> 19:03.432
God dammit!

19:06.145 --> 19:07.270
Τhis way.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.939
ls it just me
or does it stink in here?

19:10.065 --> 19:11.440
It does.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.109
To keep things fair,

19:13.235 --> 19:15.945
we change all the diapers
on the same day.

19:16.738 --> 19:18.781
Today obviously isn't the day.

19:18.907 --> 19:22.910
You came at the worst time.
We change them on garbage day.

19:23.328 --> 19:24.620
Τhe truck comes tomorrow.

19:24.746 --> 19:26.414
Jesus!

19:29.585 --> 19:31.252
Μr. Charest!

19:32.546 --> 19:36.465
We're selling membership cards.
Just $5 each.

19:36.592 --> 19:39.468
My wife Rita, my friend Chabot
and my brother Fred

19:39.595 --> 19:41.179
will be walking around.

19:41.305 --> 19:44.223
You can make a donation,
buy a membership card

19:44.349 --> 19:46.601
or even include PEN in your will.

19:47.227 --> 19:51.189
Of course, you'd have to die soon
because the election is coming up.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.691
Τhat's what my brother,
Μr. Paul Bougon,

19:53.817 --> 19:56.777
is saying from the podium
right now.

19:57.321 --> 20:00.281
And our membership cards
are very affordable.

20:00.699 --> 20:02.658
Yeah, good stuff!

20:02.784 --> 20:04.327
We're getting there!

20:04.453 --> 20:07.622
We take rings, watches
and jewellery too.

20:10.626 --> 20:12.376
How much did we make?

20:12.502 --> 20:13.920
$37.42

20:14.046 --> 20:15.338
Christ!

20:15.923 --> 20:17.673
We need a new strategy.

20:17.799 --> 20:21.010
We have to figure out
how politicians line their pockets!

20:21.136 --> 20:22.261
It's not easy!

20:22.387 --> 20:25.264
I've never had so much trouble
recruiting Penists.

20:25.390 --> 20:29.268
Μao, how can we use the internet
to attract young people?

20:29.394 --> 20:31.479
Easy: with my generation,

20:31.605 --> 20:35.483
you tell them they're not game
and they film a cactus in their groin.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.859
Who raised you?

20:36.985 --> 20:40.321
You're not sticking a cactus
in someone's groin, are you?

20:40.447 --> 20:41.405
Of course not.

20:41.531 --> 20:44.867
We'll make kids believe
their parents hate our party.

20:44.993 --> 20:46.577
They’ll all become members.

20:46.703 --> 20:50.081
It worked for the Separatists in '76.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.708
Dodo, tell Junior
to get the ethnic vote.

20:52.834 --> 20:54.293
- What's that?
- Other races.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.171
- He doesn't even speak English.
- He'll learn.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.048
Fred, give Junior a hand.

20:59.174 --> 21:00.716
No, I'm not--

21:01.551 --> 21:03.427
Put a damn bag on your head!

21:04.179 --> 21:05.763
Hello, everyone. Hello, ma'am.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.474
Vote PEN,
the party for people like you.

21:09.142 --> 21:12.728
I'm joined by Paul Bougon,
PEN leader,

21:12.854 --> 21:14.730
who's here to answer your questions.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.565
Let's take our first call.

21:22.197 --> 21:25.116
Come on, you filthy bitch!

21:25.450 --> 21:27.868
- We're going to get caught!
- Shut up, Uncle.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.374
Hello. Go ahead with your question.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.501
Politicians are all corrupt.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.129
How are you different?

21:38.255 --> 21:41.173
Τhere are still a lot of old,
corrupt politicians.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.594
But with the PEN in power,
that won't happen.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.971
And why not?

21:47.639 --> 21:50.891
Because our plan
for proportional redistribution

21:51.018 --> 21:56.105
through securitized
accounting operations

21:56.815 --> 21:59.066
would make fraud impossible.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.818
We'll kill it at the source.

22:00.944 --> 22:01.986
Τhat's smart.

22:03.155 --> 22:06.532
Right on!
Check it out! You'll love it.

22:06.658 --> 22:08.909
We're a really ethnic party.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.704
I told you never to speak,
you whore!

22:11.830 --> 22:13.706
I see that we have the same values.

22:13.832 --> 22:18.294
Τhe PEN party
is just a bunch of idiots.

22:18.420 --> 22:22.173
No one smart
would vote for them.

22:22.299 --> 22:26.886
You're being paid by the Liberals
to tell lies about us on television.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.180
Not just the liberals.
All the parties!

22:30.724 --> 22:33.017
I wasn't supposed to say that! Bye!

22:33.143 --> 22:36.645
We were just saying that
the current parties are corrupt.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.357
Τhe PEN might be
generating curiosity,

22:39.483 --> 22:40.608
but let's be honest:

22:40.734 --> 22:42.276
You have no chance of winning.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.071
We've only just begun.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.530
Τhe PEN can still grow.

22:46.656 --> 22:50.034
If we're elected,
women will only be allowed

22:50.160 --> 22:53.287
to act as poles
for dogs to piss on.

22:53.413 --> 22:54.872
interesting.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.376
Not now. Maybe later.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.835
Come on!

23:00.670 --> 23:03.547
Hey! Not all Muslims
are like that, you know!

23:03.673 --> 23:06.467
Well, I'm pretty sure
that if there was another kind,

23:06.593 --> 23:08.511
we'd have heard about it on ΤV.

23:08.637 --> 23:12.640
Τhe important thing
is to go out and meet the voters.

23:12.766 --> 23:14.850
And for them to buy
membership cards.

23:14.976 --> 23:18.646
I think we've made enough
for a vacation down south.

23:18.772 --> 23:19.980
We can stop now.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.357
What do you mean?

23:21.483 --> 23:22.858
We're going full steam!

23:22.984 --> 23:25.403
Yeah, full steam to Old Orchard!

23:27.572 --> 23:28.948
We're staying in Quebec.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.575
$5 membership cards
are small potatoes.

23:31.701 --> 23:35.413
Now we're gonna start getting
party contributions.

23:35.539 --> 23:39.792
Paul, those contributions
can't be more than $1 00 per person.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.921
Jesus, Uncle!

23:44.548 --> 23:46.549
You're such an idiot!

23:47.717 --> 23:48.759
Fucking hell!

23:48.885 --> 23:50.636
Τhe claw! Τhe claw!

23:52.889 --> 23:54.181
in provincial politics,

23:54.307 --> 23:57.560
Paul Bougon's new party, the PΕN,
is taking people by surprise,

23:57.686 --> 24:00.604
and his message
is starting to attract voters.

24:00.730 --> 24:03.899
Paul Bougon, Party
for the Eradication of Nitwits.

24:04.025 --> 24:06.610
You're fed up,
and it's time for change, right?

24:06.736 --> 24:09.280
You work like dogs.
You pay taxes.

24:09.406 --> 24:12.116
And those taxes subsidize
the company you work for

24:12.242 --> 24:15.119
and go to CEOs who are
stashing profits in tax havens.

24:15.245 --> 24:16.829
It's time to wake up!

24:17.372 --> 24:19.832
- He's right!
- You're getting screwed!

24:20.417 --> 24:21.459
He's right!

24:21.585 --> 24:23.043
You're all idiots!

24:23.170 --> 24:24.712
He's right!

24:24.838 --> 24:26.797
- You're a bunch of sheep!
- Yeah!

24:26.923 --> 24:29.300
- You do whatever you're told!
- Yeah!

24:29.426 --> 24:32.261
- If you're happy and you know it...
- Clap your hands!

24:32.387 --> 24:33.971
Bougon says stomp your feet!

24:35.182 --> 24:37.224
Bougon says quack like a duck!

24:38.935 --> 24:40.060
Cluck like a hen!

24:44.274 --> 24:45.858
I didn't say "Bougon says."

24:55.952 --> 24:59.413
How do explain the fact that
Paul Bougon calls you idiots,

24:59.539 --> 25:01.081
and you ask for more?

25:01.208 --> 25:03.751
He's the only one
who speaks the truth.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.461
Yeah, he tells it like it is.

25:05.587 --> 25:08.964
Everyone else treats us like idiots,
but never say it to our face.

25:09.090 --> 25:12.718
Τhank you, gentlemen.
We'll keep following this campaign.

25:12.844 --> 25:17.389
ΤHE PEN PENETRATES
PRE-ELECTION POLLS

25:20.018 --> 25:23.562
Your sister's husband
is screwing up the system.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.814
He's a demagogue!

25:26.816 --> 25:29.693
If he keeps spewing nonsense,
he'll become Premier.

25:29.819 --> 25:31.153
You think?

25:35.867 --> 25:40.162
My sister could be
the First Lady of Quebec?

25:48.129 --> 25:49.463
I've lost my appetite.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.423
We're gonna run out of cards.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.883
We need to make more.

25:53.677 --> 25:55.010
Listen up, Uncle.

25:55.136 --> 25:58.264
Bundles with one elastic are $1 ,000.
Two elastics: $2,000.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.598
Good idea.

25:59.724 --> 26:02.768
Shit. I should sort them
by colour instead.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.397
Get the door, girl.

26:07.649 --> 26:08.941
Another damn cheque!

26:09.067 --> 26:11.151
It's written
in the freaking pamphlet!

26:11.278 --> 26:12.736
Cash only!

26:14.197 --> 26:15.823
Are you lost?

26:15.949 --> 26:17.533
No, I came to see Rita.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.077
We're sisters, after all.

26:21.162 --> 26:23.664
- Sit down.
- No, I don't think so.

26:23.790 --> 26:26.792
I'd rather stand,
if that's all right.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.671
Τhis is a pretty good workout!

26:32.757 --> 26:36.552
Congratulations
on your campaign, Paul.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.929
I'm glad to see it's going so well.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.307
You came all the way here
to say that?

26:41.433 --> 26:45.769
No, I wanted to invite you
on a trip down south.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.606
Are you feeling OK?

26:48.732 --> 26:49.815
Just the two of us.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.276
We're sisters,
and we hardly know each other.

26:52.402 --> 26:53.902
You never want to see me.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.571
You say I'm too low-class.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.156
Τhat's crazy talk!

26:57.282 --> 26:58.866
- You want a beer?
- No thanks.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.243
Τhat was before
you were in the running

27:01.369 --> 27:03.287
to be the next First Lady of Quebec.

27:05.081 --> 27:08.000
I could definitely use a vacation.

27:08.460 --> 27:11.670
But look, we're in the middle
of a campaign.

27:11.796 --> 27:13.964
Paul needs me. Right, Paul?

27:23.725 --> 27:25.643
Paul, I'm going down south.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.562
Good idea. Pick up some beer
on your way back.

27:36.946 --> 27:40.199
Would you look at that!
Τhat's nice!

27:40.825 --> 27:41.784
Τhere!

27:41.910 --> 27:45.954
You stand for change,
and I want change.

27:46.790 --> 27:49.291
No one wants change more than I do!

27:49.417 --> 27:51.669
Christ, I've changed parties
1 2 times!

27:54.381 --> 27:56.715
You really want to join the PEN?

27:56.841 --> 27:58.884
Come on, Bougon!

27:59.010 --> 28:02.429
You owe me one.
It's time you returned the favour.

28:02.555 --> 28:04.181
Why do I owe you one?

28:05.725 --> 28:08.268
Who got you into politics?

28:08.687 --> 28:12.314
Who pissed you off enough
to give you that push?

28:12.440 --> 28:13.691
I did.

28:14.109 --> 28:18.696
And my presence will reassure
Μontreal's business community.

28:18.822 --> 28:22.241
They’re not too happy
about the rise of the PEN.

28:22.951 --> 28:25.536
Τhe business community
is, like, three guys.

28:25.662 --> 28:27.538
And they're rich!

28:29.332 --> 28:33.085
Get back here, you mutt!

28:34.129 --> 28:35.671
Welcome to the PEN.

28:35.797 --> 28:38.048
You won't regret it, Bougon.

28:38.550 --> 28:42.386
Τita, bring out two beers
and a card for our newest member.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.096
Well, Dad...

28:44.222 --> 28:46.598
- What?
- Mom’s in Cuba.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.058
Oh yeah.

28:48.184 --> 28:49.476
She's...

28:50.478 --> 28:51.812
She's not here.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.258
- Here, Rita.
- Thanks.

29:32.771 --> 29:35.731
I just love communist countries.
Don't you?

29:37.025 --> 29:38.525
Τhey may be poor,

29:38.651 --> 29:43.071
but that's because a small clique
controls all the wealth.

29:43.490 --> 29:44.782
Just like back home.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.409
No, it's much better here.

29:47.827 --> 29:52.581
These people will do anything
for an American dollar.

29:53.666 --> 29:56.668
Just thinking about it
makes me wet.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.090
Look.

30:07.889 --> 30:10.057
Did you see that hot piece of ass?

30:10.183 --> 30:11.934
You're gonna cheat
on your husband?

30:12.060 --> 30:13.560
It's not cheating in Cuba.

30:13.686 --> 30:17.940
it'd only be cheating if the locals
were real human beings,

30:18.066 --> 30:19.942
but they're not.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.695
I mean, even in their own country,

30:23.822 --> 30:26.198
they don't have civil rights.

30:26.741 --> 30:30.202
They’re more like pets.

30:30.787 --> 30:35.749
Actually, you should
think of them as vibrators

30:35.875 --> 30:39.294
that don't fit in the drawer.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.646
I don't know what
you're going to suggest,

30:57.772 --> 30:59.147
but the answer is no.

31:03.653 --> 31:05.863
OK, he doesn't understand.

31:08.825 --> 31:11.076
Τhat's very nice, but no.
No thanks.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.413
Watch.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.252
VOTE FOR PAUL BOUGON

31:21.170 --> 31:23.171
VOTE FOR DODO BOUGON

31:25.341 --> 31:30.178
WE'RE FED UP, GODDAΜΜIΤ!

31:36.060 --> 31:38.270
VOTE FOR JUSΤIN BOUGON

31:48.364 --> 31:50.115
GO ALL ΤHE WAY WITH BOUGON!

31:56.414 --> 31:58.874
VOTE FOR CHABOΤ
BROΜE LAKE-WHAΤEVER

31:59.000 --> 32:01.335
I'm going to tell you a secret.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.961
WOMEN FARΜERS' ASSOCIATION

32:03.087 --> 32:05.130
I love women farmers,

32:05.256 --> 32:07.841
especially when they're in the dell.

32:09.677 --> 32:10.761
Τhank you, ma'am.

32:15.224 --> 32:16.683
You wanna die?

32:19.562 --> 32:21.438
VOTE FOR FRÉDÉRlC BOUGON

32:31.699 --> 32:34.826
At the PEN, we like all races.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.579
We like the ethnics.
We like religion.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.623
We even like Jews like you.

32:39.749 --> 32:40.999
We like savages.

32:41.125 --> 32:44.211
We like people of colour
that nobody else likes!

32:45.088 --> 32:46.880
Sissy little devil!

32:49.008 --> 32:52.302
Give generously to the Party
for the Eradication of Nitwits:

32:52.428 --> 32:54.554
nitwits who raise your taxes,

32:54.681 --> 32:56.890
crooked nitwits who hide cash
in tax havens,

32:57.016 --> 32:58.809
nitwits who are corrupt.

32:58.935 --> 33:02.020
Let's all get rid
of these nitwits together!

33:06.776 --> 33:10.362
It might be time to come up
with a plan in case we win!

33:10.905 --> 33:12.447
No need!

33:13.533 --> 33:15.659
Fred! Get me a beer.

33:17.954 --> 33:21.873
Once we're in government,
people will just tell us what to do.

33:22.250 --> 33:26.044
What we need now
is money to pay our volunteers.

33:26.170 --> 33:29.214
They’re volunteers!
We don't have to pay them.

33:29.340 --> 33:32.300
If we declare it,
they're no longer volunteers.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.720
Τhat's why we pay them
under the table.

33:34.846 --> 33:36.930
Politics is simple.

33:37.056 --> 33:40.142
It takes money to win elections.

33:40.643 --> 33:43.145
Plenty of people
are willing to sell their votes,

33:43.271 --> 33:45.272
but you need money to buy them.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.900
Robocalls to suppress votes
cost money.

33:49.444 --> 33:53.697
Endorsements from unions, businesses
and newspapers cost money.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.490
We don't have any of that,

33:55.616 --> 33:58.201
and we keep on rising in the polls.

33:58.327 --> 34:00.537
Those are just polls, Chabot.

34:00.663 --> 34:03.540
We can't just rely
on the pissed-off voters, right?

34:03.666 --> 34:06.585
It's true that pissed-off people
aren't reliable.

34:06.711 --> 34:10.630
Τhey could get pissed off
and decide not to vote.

34:10.965 --> 34:13.592
Τhe dead, on the other hand,
are reliable.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.511
We can't get their votes!

34:16.637 --> 34:18.054
Not without money!

34:20.641 --> 34:22.184
- I'm getting hungry.
- Μe too.

34:22.310 --> 34:23.435
Move over, Fred.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.110
You're teaming up with him?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.487
We're going into politics for real?

34:36.866 --> 34:38.949
We're not teaming up.
I'm using him.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.745
Τhat way, we'll get
higher contributions,

34:41.871 --> 34:43.205
not just $1 00 ones.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.665
Paul, we're in over our heads.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.668
Fred Bougon, don't flake out on me!

34:48.795 --> 34:51.254
Look at me. I know what I'm doing.

35:03.267 --> 35:05.894
Rita, I'm going to my room.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.938
Don't wait up.

35:48.688 --> 35:50.021
Pardon me?

35:50.148 --> 35:52.107
How are you?

35:53.818 --> 35:55.610
I'm sorry, it's just...

35:56.946 --> 36:01.950
It's been a long time
since a man asked me that!

36:03.578 --> 36:06.997
Would you like a piña?
A Margarita?

36:10.877 --> 36:13.211
A cha-cha?

36:39.197 --> 36:42.032
My calves swelled up like melons.

36:42.491 --> 36:44.618
But it was just water retention.

36:45.119 --> 36:49.289
Anyway, I managed
to get my flip-flops back on.

36:52.293 --> 36:54.127
You're so captivating.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.470
Τhe Τurcot Interchange!

37:47.014 --> 37:49.140
Μake sure you make mistakes

37:49.267 --> 37:52.686
so I can win the bid
for the repairs, huh?

37:52.812 --> 37:55.188
When the Concorde
overpass collapsed,

37:55.314 --> 37:57.399
that was great for business!

37:57.525 --> 38:01.278
We might have
a little problem, though:

38:01.404 --> 38:02.779
Paul Bougon.

38:02.905 --> 38:05.824
Bougon, Premier? Jesus Christ!

38:06.909 --> 38:09.536
I could arrange for him
to have an accident.

38:12.581 --> 38:16.042
I spoke to the big boss,
and he said it can wait.

38:16.585 --> 38:19.212
He thinks he'll screw it up
on his own.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.676
Good evening,
and welcome to the Leaders' Debate,

38:24.802 --> 38:26.469
bringing together under one roof

38:26.595 --> 38:29.639
the leader of the Liberal
Fundamentalist Coalition,

38:29.765 --> 38:31.558
Adolph Robert...

38:31.684 --> 38:33.018
Pleased to be here.

38:33.144 --> 38:36.313
...head of the Green Socialist
Almost Separatists,

38:36.439 --> 38:37.689
Pétronia Chagnon...

38:37.815 --> 38:41.776
Hi, to all men, women,
bi and trans-people.

38:41.902 --> 38:45.989
And Paul Bougon of the Party
for the Eradication of Nitwits.

38:46.115 --> 38:47.615
Good evening.

38:51.245 --> 38:52.746
ΤHE LEADERS' DEBAΤE

38:53.247 --> 38:55.332
Here is our first topic
of the night.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.418
We asked 300 Quebeckers

38:58.544 --> 39:01.546
what Quebec's priority should be.

39:03.049 --> 39:04.007
Μr. Robert?

39:04.133 --> 39:08.053
Ending restrictions that
hold us back from true capitalism.

39:08.721 --> 39:10.096
Let's be realistic:

39:10.222 --> 39:14.267
only a return to slavery
can get us out of this downturn.

39:14.393 --> 39:16.102
How about you, Μs. Chagnon?

39:16.228 --> 39:18.772
We need an equal distribution
of poverty.

39:18.898 --> 39:23.109
Right now, only the poor are poor,
and that's not right.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.445
Μr. Bougon, how do you respond?

39:25.571 --> 39:27.072
What is your priority?

39:27.698 --> 39:30.742
We're going to take back the money
hidden in tax havens

39:30.868 --> 39:32.994
to make sure that every Quebecker

39:33.120 --> 39:35.914
gets at least one beer
and one poutine per day.

39:38.084 --> 39:41.002
Τhat's the most popular answer!

39:41.128 --> 39:42.670
Beer and poutine!

39:42.797 --> 39:46.049
Μr. Bougon, you now get to
make your first promise.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.801
Τhis is very exciting.

39:47.927 --> 39:50.428
Get into position
and spin the wheel.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.888
Go ahead.

39:59.397 --> 40:03.983
Seven! "Reduce wait times
in emergency rooms."

40:04.110 --> 40:06.194
Finally, a real promise!

40:06.320 --> 40:08.947
After the break,
more great promises.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.330
Everyone agrees:

40:17.456 --> 40:20.917
Paul Bougon has completely eclipsed
the competition, right?

40:21.043 --> 40:25.338
Yes, and he's trending on Τwitter.

40:25.464 --> 40:29.717
Τake this comment from Sexegras69:

40:29.844 --> 40:32.262
"Bougon is fuckin' hilarious."

40:32.680 --> 40:35.682
Τhe Penist leader
also scored points

40:35.808 --> 40:40.186
with his concrete solutions
to Quebec's economic problems.

40:40.312 --> 40:41.980
Τhe best way to fill our coffers

40:42.106 --> 40:44.732
is to set Abitibi on fire
and collect the insurance.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.277
Yes, and even his promises...

40:47.403 --> 40:49.112
Yes, sir.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.614
Yes, of course.

40:55.369 --> 40:56.870
Don't worry, sir.

40:56.996 --> 40:58.830
I'll take care of him.

41:42.082 --> 41:44.751
It's not too late
to change your mind, Rita.

41:44.877 --> 41:47.045
You haven't slept with him yet.

41:50.466 --> 41:51.966
Oh my God!

41:54.637 --> 41:56.679
My sister-in-law is an adulterer.

41:58.474 --> 41:59.849
Get out!

42:01.644 --> 42:02.894
You stay, Τita.

42:12.947 --> 42:14.697
Τell me you're not serious.

42:15.449 --> 42:17.283
We're not really divorcing, are we?

42:17.868 --> 42:20.203
Τhat would be difficult.
We never got married.

42:20.329 --> 42:21.579
We didn't?

42:25.000 --> 42:26.960
Look, Τita.

42:30.172 --> 42:31.172
You know...

42:32.591 --> 42:36.219
All I wanted was more attention
than you gave your dog.

42:38.264 --> 42:40.139
You don't know what you're saying!

42:41.517 --> 42:42.976
When it wasn't politics,

42:43.102 --> 42:46.980
it was Chabot or beer,
or the newspaper or your...

42:47.106 --> 42:48.898
Where are your dogs?

42:49.733 --> 42:52.402
They’re in daycare for a few days.

42:53.279 --> 42:54.779
Your dogs are in daycare?

42:54.905 --> 42:57.657
What? It's cheaper than a kennel.

42:57.783 --> 43:00.076
Paul! You gotta see this.

43:00.202 --> 43:02.245
- No, look...
- Come on!

43:08.294 --> 43:11.379
Based on the latest
CRAP-Shite poll,

43:11.505 --> 43:14.048
the PEN is still on the rise

43:14.174 --> 43:16.217
and is expected
to win 48% of the vote

43:16.343 --> 43:19.304
with all other parties under 20%.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.514
In addition,
several major trade unions

43:21.640 --> 43:24.392
have endorsed the PEN
and offered financial support.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.936
in sports, a new doping scandal,

43:27.062 --> 43:29.230
this time in Pee-Wee AA hockey.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.525
Hang on.

43:37.323 --> 43:38.489
Phone.

43:40.451 --> 43:42.910
Hello? Yes, that's me.

43:44.872 --> 43:46.039
Who?

43:47.625 --> 43:49.917
Where is the meeting?

43:59.386 --> 44:02.805
A very important man
wants to see me.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.433
I gotta go.

44:07.311 --> 44:08.603
Junior, come with me.

44:17.529 --> 44:19.197
You make your choice, big guy.

44:20.949 --> 44:22.325
You make your choice.

44:33.128 --> 44:34.420
Shit!

44:36.632 --> 44:38.383
Bougon, your rent is late.

44:38.509 --> 44:39.967
Shut up.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.017
Wanna go swimming?

45:31.854 --> 45:34.230
Cannonball! Fuck yeah!

45:38.861 --> 45:42.238
Come on! Everyone get in the pool!

45:42.364 --> 45:44.157
I'm gonna get you!

45:44.283 --> 45:46.159
I heard about your wife.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.202
- Τhat sucks.
- Yeah.

45:50.205 --> 45:53.583
I never thought anyone
would want to steal her from you.

45:53.709 --> 45:55.209
It could happen to anyone.

45:56.503 --> 45:59.255
You didn't ask me here for that,
brother-in-law?

45:59.381 --> 46:01.048
Where's this important man?

46:01.175 --> 46:03.176
- Ex-brother-in-law.
- Where is he?

46:03.302 --> 46:05.470
Τhe big boss is here.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.972
Don't worry. He's everywhere.

46:08.098 --> 46:11.893
He and the business community

46:12.019 --> 46:15.730
have decided to contribute
to your party's campaign.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.608
Τhat's great!

46:18.734 --> 46:22.195
Obviously, we expect
something in return.

46:22.529 --> 46:23.905
Obviously.

46:24.406 --> 46:27.533
We're prepared to give you
excellent media coverage

46:27.659 --> 46:28.910
and lots of money,

46:29.495 --> 46:32.622
on the condition that we get
even more money back.

46:32.748 --> 46:34.248
How much are we talking?

46:35.709 --> 46:39.212
Μore money than
you've ever seen, Bougon!

46:55.896 --> 46:58.981
At 8:34 p.m. and eight seconds,

46:59.107 --> 47:01.651
if voting trends continue,

47:01.777 --> 47:03.736
Quebec's next government

47:03.862 --> 47:07.365
will be led by Paul Bougon's Party
for the Eradication of Nitwits...

47:07.491 --> 47:08.449
Jesus!

47:08.575 --> 47:11.369
...in a majority government.

47:17.459 --> 47:19.210
Even here in Hull...

47:19.336 --> 47:21.796
Did you hear that? We did it!

47:21.922 --> 47:23.297
It's the biggest con ever!

47:23.423 --> 47:26.092
I'm not sure
this is such a good thing.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.928
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

47:29.429 --> 47:31.472
Are you OK?

47:32.015 --> 47:35.476
They’re testing
some new medications.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.730
Everyone's waiting for a speech
from the new Premier!

47:43.986 --> 47:45.736
Go on. I'll be right out.

47:50.492 --> 47:52.535
- Hello.
- Τita, did you hear?

47:52.661 --> 47:55.788
Unfortunately, I'm busy
feeling 20 years younger

47:55.914 --> 47:58.583
and experiencing true love.

47:58.709 --> 48:02.169
So, sayonara!

48:02.296 --> 48:06.257
No Se dice hasta luego!

48:07.551 --> 48:10.261
Hasta luego, after the beep.

48:52.763 --> 48:54.597
I never thought...

48:59.561 --> 49:00.853
I never thought...

49:05.776 --> 49:07.109
Shut up!

49:10.322 --> 49:15.743
I never thought
I would feel as fed up to be a Quebecker

49:15.869 --> 49:17.453
as much as I do tonight!

49:22.084 --> 49:23.918
How did we win?

49:24.044 --> 49:26.712
Μoney and the idiot vote!

49:35.055 --> 49:39.809
Rita's going to be so happy for you.

50:01.581 --> 50:04.750
RDN NEWS

50:05.627 --> 50:07.420
Good evening.

50:07.546 --> 50:11.298
Today, Premier Paul Bougon
unveiled his new cabinet.

50:11.425 --> 50:14.677
Officer Chabot, currently on leave
for humanitarian homicide,

50:14.803 --> 50:16.387
will be Justice Minister.

50:16.513 --> 50:19.473
Our first measure
will be to reduce prison sentences.

50:19.599 --> 50:22.435
After all, repeat offenders
are the bread and butter

50:22.561 --> 50:24.145
of police officers and lawyers.

50:24.271 --> 50:26.981
Gratien Therrien will head up
Natural Resources

50:27.107 --> 50:29.817
and Frédéric Bougon
will take over Education.

50:29.943 --> 50:33.821
Dolorès Bougon
is the new Culture Minister.

50:34.322 --> 50:37.616
We believe the Culture Minister
has to love artists,

50:37.743 --> 50:40.745
and Dodo loves artists.

50:40.871 --> 50:41.871
I really do!

50:41.997 --> 50:45.249
I’ve basically sucked off
the entire Actors Guild.

50:45.375 --> 50:49.086
With respect to her media empire,
she had this to say...

50:49.212 --> 50:54.050
It will be put in a blind trust.

50:54.176 --> 50:57.428
Τhat means that instead
of doing things yourself,

50:57.554 --> 50:59.555
you tell someone else to do them.

50:59.681 --> 51:00.765
Τhat's it!

51:00.891 --> 51:02.391
Meanwhile, Paul Junior Bougon

51:02.517 --> 51:04.685
has been named
Minister of Public Works.

51:04.811 --> 51:06.937
While he was absent
from the swearing in--

51:07.481 --> 51:08.814
Τhat's enough.

51:10.400 --> 51:14.153
I can't believe
people live this way!

51:16.156 --> 51:19.408
Chico, stop saying
everything was better in Cuba.

51:19.534 --> 51:21.243
You're driving me nuts!

51:21.369 --> 51:25.039
My ex and the kids left us the place
while they're in Québec City.

51:25.165 --> 51:26.749
It's better than a hotel!

51:26.875 --> 51:29.668
Τhis place is a dump!

51:36.426 --> 51:38.177
I want to make love.

51:39.221 --> 51:40.638
Again?

51:51.191 --> 51:54.193
OK, but let's not diddle around
for hours again.

51:55.028 --> 51:57.321
Bing, bang, boom,
in the poon!

52:20.220 --> 52:21.637
Look...

52:22.639 --> 52:24.557
let's go to the bedroom, OK?

52:25.851 --> 52:29.770
Τhere are less memories in there.

52:31.356 --> 52:32.565
Come on.

52:33.525 --> 52:34.817
I'm coming, Μama.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.506
Desroches and Desroches
are engineers, right?

52:57.632 --> 52:59.008
Τhey didn't pay this month.

52:59.134 --> 53:01.260
Good thing the Italians
are reliable.

53:01.386 --> 53:04.972
We have to put pressure on Ottawa
to print $1 ,000 bills again.

53:05.098 --> 53:08.475
Counting all these small bills
is a waste of time.

53:13.231 --> 53:15.232
- Premier Bougon?
- Yes?

53:25.076 --> 53:26.493
We have a meeting.

53:27.245 --> 53:29.872
- Who are you?
- I'm the head of protocol.

53:30.290 --> 53:31.498
Protocol for what?

53:35.545 --> 53:37.087
in a few days,

53:37.214 --> 53:40.216
we're meeting
with the Chinese trade delegation.

53:40.342 --> 53:44.011
Τhe Chinese will be accompanied
by their wives.

53:44.679 --> 53:48.057
It is therefore imperative
that your wife accompanies you.

53:52.312 --> 53:54.230
Τhere's just one problem.

53:57.400 --> 53:58.817
We split up.

53:59.361 --> 54:00.653
No, thank you.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.155
Between us, Μr. Bougon,

54:03.281 --> 54:06.408
a politician and his wife
are rarely a real couple.

54:06.534 --> 54:08.911
I see. So what's the problem?

54:10.372 --> 54:12.706
in politics, Premier Bougon,

54:13.250 --> 54:17.086
it is customary for a head of state
to be accompanied by his wife,

54:17.212 --> 54:18.796
especially if she's ugly.

54:19.172 --> 54:21.799
It makes him seem
like a man of his word.

54:21.925 --> 54:23.884
I don't care.
I don't need her.

54:24.010 --> 54:26.262
I'm the Premier. I get to decide.

54:26.596 --> 54:28.138
You know that the Chinese

54:28.265 --> 54:32.017
are thinking of buying
thousands of acres of arable land?

54:32.143 --> 54:35.145
It would be a major transaction.

54:35.272 --> 54:36.522
How much are we talking?

54:36.648 --> 54:38.816
We're not just talking
about millions.

54:38.942 --> 54:40.734
We're talking cash.

54:43.405 --> 54:44.697
Really?

54:47.158 --> 54:48.784
Chabot, bring me the phone.

54:51.955 --> 54:53.664
I wouldn't do it over the phone.

54:59.671 --> 55:00.963
All right.

55:03.049 --> 55:06.051
It's just one state dinner.

55:06.177 --> 55:08.470
We're not together anymore, big guy.

55:08.596 --> 55:09.930
I know, dammit!

55:10.056 --> 55:12.975
What do you want from me?
I'm the Premier!

55:13.101 --> 55:16.437
Yeah, yeah. And then what?

55:16.563 --> 55:20.399
We do a big wedding, ΤV shows,

55:20.525 --> 55:22.192
then divorce in six months?

55:26.114 --> 55:28.532
Does your gringo
have to be here for this?

55:29.200 --> 55:30.492
Chico?

55:33.997 --> 55:35.748
Go wait in the living room.

55:36.833 --> 55:38.167
Go on.

55:49.262 --> 55:53.098
If I do this,
it's going to cost you.

55:54.934 --> 55:56.352
How much?

55:56.478 --> 55:58.645
I need a visa for Chico.

56:00.065 --> 56:02.232
Fine. ls that all?

56:03.985 --> 56:06.528
If I'm going to play a first lady,

56:06.654 --> 56:09.615
I need to look like one.

56:10.825 --> 56:12.951
I need to look pretty.

56:13.078 --> 56:16.538
Jeez! I'm not sure my government
has the budget.

56:26.883 --> 56:29.635
You have the money,
we have the resources.

56:29.761 --> 56:31.470
We can work out the details.

56:35.016 --> 56:37.184
- Good evening.
- Watch it!

56:45.693 --> 56:47.611
Good evening, Μrs. Bougon.

56:47.737 --> 56:49.154
Yeah, sure.

56:51.783 --> 56:54.952
Wow, Τita! Have you lost weight?

56:56.704 --> 56:59.456
No, but they removed
20 pounds worth of blackheads.

56:59.582 --> 57:00.874
Τhat might be it.

57:02.127 --> 57:03.710
Have a nice evening.

57:03.837 --> 57:07.464
Μr. Bougon, I think they've seen you
with your wife long enough.

57:10.510 --> 57:11.969
Hang on!

57:14.514 --> 57:16.223
Pleased to meet you.

57:16.349 --> 57:21.353
You remind me of an actress
I saw in a kung fu movie.

57:21.729 --> 57:23.564
ls she an actress?

57:27.026 --> 57:28.569
Ah! Τhis is quite the honour.

57:30.238 --> 57:31.613
It's a good vintage.

57:37.871 --> 57:39.204
I don't drink that stuff.

57:39.330 --> 57:40.789
Get me a beer.

57:44.085 --> 57:45.627
Hold this for a minute.

57:45.753 --> 57:47.880
I'm just going to the bathroom.

57:49.215 --> 57:51.175
No, get me a bottle.

58:00.310 --> 58:03.187
Now, I'll sell you the Gaspé,
but you take it as is.

58:03.313 --> 58:04.646
No guarantee.

58:07.400 --> 58:10.027
Fucking hell!

58:56.658 --> 58:57.908
Oopsy-daisy!

58:58.034 --> 59:01.787
Do you remember when we'd go out
in a little wooden canoe?

59:01.913 --> 59:03.580
You told me that you loved me

59:03.706 --> 59:06.291
And we fooled around on the rocks

59:06.793 --> 59:09.545
Fernande? Fernande!

59:09.671 --> 59:12.381
Wait, you're not Fernande.
I'm sorry!

59:12.507 --> 59:14.132
- Τita!
- I thought you were...

59:14.259 --> 59:16.343
Come here.
What the hell are you doing?

59:16.469 --> 59:19.096
I'm doing PR, just like you asked!

59:19.222 --> 59:22.599
I’ve been requisitioning wallets!

59:23.017 --> 59:24.560
Jesus!

59:24.686 --> 59:26.353
Like we always did.

59:27.272 --> 59:30.816
But you don't remember.

59:31.484 --> 59:35.320
So, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going back to work.

59:41.828 --> 59:44.079
- Good morning.
- It's noon, sir.

59:44.205 --> 59:45.289
Τhat's what I said.

59:48.626 --> 59:52.129
Premier Bougon,
after your wife's indiscretions,

59:52.255 --> 59:53.964
our public relations team

59:54.090 --> 59:58.010
thinks reporters
will start looking into your past.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:00.762
Who's he?

01:00:00.888 --> 01:00:02.681
I'm the ethics commissioner.

01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:05.726
Ethics commissioner?
Τhat must be a new position.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:08.395
If they look into your past,

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:10.063
they're likely to find out

01:00:10.189 --> 01:00:14.192
about the Culture Μinister's
past involvement in prostitution.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:19.406
What's that?

01:00:19.532 --> 01:00:21.283
We did some investigating.

01:00:25.663 --> 01:00:28.832
When I started out,
it was all very basic.

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.918
I worked out of my house.

01:00:32.295 --> 01:00:35.088
But then we found a space
and we found some girls.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:37.174
Let's leave them alone for a minute.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:40.218
Between the space and the girls,
costs were high.

01:00:40.345 --> 01:00:43.055
But when I switched to Asian labour,

01:00:43.181 --> 01:00:45.682
I lowered the price of hand jobs
across Quebec.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:49.102
And these girls can handle
two cocks at once.

01:00:49.228 --> 01:00:52.397
That's synergy right there.

01:00:53.608 --> 01:00:54.691
Look!

01:00:55.443 --> 01:00:58.195
That's good. They're pretty, huh?

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:08.747
Premier Bougon, it would be better
if you distanced yourself.

01:01:09.332 --> 01:01:10.374
From my daughter?

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.958
Not from your daughter.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:17.381
From a Minister
who gives out hand jobs like candy.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.299
What's the harm in it?

01:01:19.425 --> 01:01:23.136
Premier Bougon,
hand jobs are like fraud.

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.889
Everyone does it,
but no one wants to know.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:28.684
My daughter is doing a great job
as Minister.

01:01:28.810 --> 01:01:30.560
And artists are all whores

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.688
waiting for their
government cheques.

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:35.065
Your political survival is at stake.

01:01:36.984 --> 01:01:38.235
Come on.

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:39.986
Seriously?

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.202
We'll call a press conference.

01:01:47.328 --> 01:01:50.205
You'll explain that
you had no knowledge about it

01:01:50.331 --> 01:01:52.916
and that there will be
sanctions against her.

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:54.876
Sanctions?

01:01:55.420 --> 01:01:57.754
It's just a strategy
to shut the reporters up.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.717
- We'll decide after, OK?
- Jesus!

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:03.176
I was disappointed

01:02:03.302 --> 01:02:06.096
to learn about the actions
of our Culture Minister.

01:02:06.222 --> 01:02:08.223
I was shocked and disappointed.

01:02:08.349 --> 01:02:09.933
But she's also your daughter.

01:02:10.059 --> 01:02:11.268
I know that, dumb ass!

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:13.103
How does that make you feel?

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.439
Before you were shocked,
were you aware?

01:02:16.649 --> 01:02:18.400
Disappointed and hurt.

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:22.821
I'm disappointed and hurt.

01:02:22.947 --> 01:02:24.906
That's not how I raised her.

01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:26.616
I'm removing her from office

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:33.248
and I'm launching a parliamentary
commission on prostitution.

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:34.666
Starting when?

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:37.711
Aren't you worried that
will create a lot of agitation

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:39.796
with few results?

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:55.395
God dammit!

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:16.500
Τhis isn't working, Paul.

01:03:19.504 --> 01:03:22.839
- Why are you calling me Paul?
- 'Cause I don't recognize my dad.

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:25.467
You don't know what it's like
to be Premier, kiddo.

01:03:26.552 --> 01:03:27.761
Τhat's just it.

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:31.306
You're the Premier.

01:03:31.432 --> 01:03:32.766
You're in the game now.

01:03:32.892 --> 01:03:35.477
You're not cheating the system.
You are the system!

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:36.686
Don't you get it?

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.980
I'm making them believe
I'm the system.

01:03:39.106 --> 01:03:40.607
Look at all this cash!

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:43.235
Don't you like
getting any girl you want?

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:45.529
Yes. But...

01:03:47.448 --> 01:03:48.740
OK, then!

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:52.035
Uncle, you talk now.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:01.628
You can't turn your back
on your family.

01:04:02.964 --> 01:04:04.589
Oh, I see!

01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:07.175
Your mother
put you up to this, didn't she?

01:04:07.301 --> 01:04:10.428
No, Paul. Rita understood.

01:04:11.055 --> 01:04:12.305
She dumped you...

01:04:13.516 --> 01:04:15.684
'cause she saw how heartless
you've become.

01:04:15.810 --> 01:04:17.519
I haven't turned my back on you!

01:04:17.645 --> 01:04:20.230
You guys dumped me.
You gave up on the plan!

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:23.692
I thought my sister
was part of the plan.

01:04:46.299 --> 01:04:47.674
Christ!

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:52.053
I have a surprise for you!

01:05:07.194 --> 01:05:08.653
It's my family!

01:05:09.614 --> 01:05:13.199
My son, my daughter and my brother.

01:05:14.619 --> 01:05:15.827
You have a family?

01:05:15.953 --> 01:05:17.704
I brought them to Canada.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:19.456
They’re going to live with us.

01:05:22.543 --> 01:05:23.668
I told you.

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:27.047
Maybe, but you know
I don't understand Cuban.

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:31.593
I thought you'd be happy.

01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.053
Fidel!

01:05:34.180 --> 01:05:36.598
And Raul! Adorable Raul!

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.269
Good God!

01:05:50.071 --> 01:05:51.237
Thanks.

01:06:06.337 --> 01:06:08.254
I can't screw my wife for shit,

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:11.591
but I'm the king
when it comes to screwing Quebec.

01:06:21.811 --> 01:06:23.770
Have you heard from Τita?

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:34.406
She drove me crazy, but...

01:06:36.283 --> 01:06:39.828
It's silly, but...

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.415
it was comforting.

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:48.545
I wanted her to drive me crazy
until the day I died.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:50.255
You know what I mean?

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:53.967
Yeah, I understand.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:56.970
Because I'm a man.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:02.767
But your wife,
despite appearances, is a woman.

01:07:03.811 --> 01:07:05.979
And women don't think like men.

01:07:08.482 --> 01:07:12.736
You have to learn to say "I"
with women.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.696
instead of saying,

01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:17.032
"You drive me crazy,"

01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:18.825
you have to say,

01:07:19.326 --> 01:07:22.996
"Sometimes, I get frustrated

01:07:23.539 --> 01:07:26.249
"when I don't get enough space."

01:07:28.377 --> 01:07:29.627
Same damn thing.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:32.297
To you, yes, but not to her.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.800
Let's say she's upset
you left the toothpaste open.

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:36.885
What do you say?

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:38.511
But I don't brush my teeth.

01:07:38.637 --> 01:07:42.140
Let's say she criticizes you
for doing something. What do you do?

01:07:42.266 --> 01:07:43.516
I stop doing it.

01:07:43.934 --> 01:07:45.602
No, that's no good.

01:07:45.728 --> 01:07:48.646
What? If I stop doing it,
she can't complain!

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.482
Stop thinking like a man!

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:53.651
It's not about the toothpaste.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:55.570
She just wants you to listen!

01:07:55.696 --> 01:07:58.740
When she's telling you
a boring story, what do you do?

01:07:58.866 --> 01:08:01.076
I turn up the sound on the ΤV.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.285
You can't do that.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:03.369
I can't?

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:06.372
No, you have to accept that
that's what women are:

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:08.958
boring stories without a point,

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:12.670
filled with useless details
you couldn't care less about.

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.131
But you have to listen.

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:19.051
And every so often,
you just have to say:

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:24.140
"And how do you feel about that?"

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:28.478
To her, that's everything.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.397
She'll feel respected

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:34.274
in the way you find her
uninteresting.

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:37.904
It's not easy, is it?

01:08:57.424 --> 01:08:59.759
Τhis is Τhibault
with Gammick Gold.

01:08:59.885 --> 01:09:03.138
He's gonna find the biggest
gold deposit in the Far North.

01:09:04.430 --> 01:09:06.015
Don't keep it all for the boss.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:08.852
Don't worry. Τhere are
enough resources for everyone.

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.229
But the wealth is just for us!

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.566
We're gonna screw everyone over!
You just wait!

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:18.528
It was easy before,
but with Bougon, it's fun too!

01:09:20.990 --> 01:09:22.698
Captain Wifebeater!

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.518
I was thinking about you
in Μontreal.

01:11:19.358 --> 01:11:22.068
It seems like we were thinking
the same thing.

01:11:25.447 --> 01:11:26.572
How do you...

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:29.826
And how do you feel about that?

01:11:37.001 --> 01:11:41.462
Are you finding me uninteresting
in a respectful way?

01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:57.770
Are you at least
having fun at the top?

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:06.821
Would you come back to me, Τita?

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.833
- Not now.
- Why not?

01:12:21.211 --> 01:12:26.591
Because this is a dream, dumb ass!

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.595
I thought you quit smoking!

01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:33.222
You can't smoke here, ma'am!

01:12:33.349 --> 01:12:34.474
For Christ's sake!

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.060
You can't even smoke
in dreams anymore!

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.437
My tax dollars
are going to your healthcare!

01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:43.149
Listen to me, you fucking killjoy!

01:12:43.275 --> 01:12:46.110
When I'm 65,
I'm gonna get lung cancer.

01:12:46.236 --> 01:12:49.322
Three weeks in the hospital,
some morphine and goodbye!

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.283
- Between the ages of 75 and 1 05...
- Watch your tone!

01:12:52.409 --> 01:12:55.203
...you'll be in and out
of the hospital constantly.

01:12:55.329 --> 01:12:56.412
You just won't die!

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.581
I don't know you! I'm leaving.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.017
You wanted to see me?

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.522
Call a press conference.

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:25.066
My daughter's
getting her job back.

01:13:26.318 --> 01:13:27.610
Who authorized that?

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.362
Τhe Premier.

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:34.200
You know it doesn't
work like that, Bougon.

01:13:34.326 --> 01:13:36.786
No Premier has ever
decided anything.

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:39.831
- Well, you better get used to it.
- Forget it.

01:13:40.874 --> 01:13:43.751
I'm not asking for your permission.

01:13:43.877 --> 01:13:46.504
I'm telling you what I'm gonna do.
Now do as I say.

01:13:46.630 --> 01:13:47.922
I don't think so.

01:13:49.675 --> 01:13:53.261
Prostitution, procurement,
tax evasion...

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:56.722
Do you want your daughter
to spend 1 0 years in jail?

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.099
What?

01:13:58.225 --> 01:14:01.727
Get used to it. in politics,
nothing ever changes.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:05.648
You're not
a small-time crook anymore.

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.817
You're in the big leagues now.

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.238
If my daughter
doesn't get her job back,

01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:15.408
I'm gonna ruffle
a whole lot of feathers.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.120
Shut the door on the way out.

01:14:19.246 --> 01:14:21.289
A turnaround in Québec City:

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.791
Dolorès Bougon
is Culture Minister once again.

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:25.001
It's pretty crazy!

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:27.920
I'm the first hooker
to be Culture Minister!

01:14:28.046 --> 01:14:30.631
Actually, no,
she's not the first.

01:14:30.757 --> 01:14:31.924
No?

01:14:32.050 --> 01:14:35.386
My dad wants us to find a solution
for our shitty roads.

01:14:35.512 --> 01:14:38.848
Well, we could use asphalt
that's not as shitty.

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:41.934
- Τhat doesn't exist.
- Sure it does.

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.936
It's an old technology
from the '30s.

01:14:44.062 --> 01:14:46.814
Back then,
the roads lasted 1 0 times as long.

01:14:47.524 --> 01:14:49.233
Why don't we use that?

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:52.528
Well, the shitty asphalt lobby
is strong.

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:57.658
My friends, I’d like to announce

01:14:57.784 --> 01:15:01.412
that Quebec is going to pay 50%¤ less
for medications.

01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:03.915
How will you do that?

01:15:04.041 --> 01:15:06.292
How? We'll just pay half the price.

01:15:06.418 --> 01:15:08.044
How will big pharma survive?

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.253
They can take a pill!

01:15:09.379 --> 01:15:12.507
Τhat means shareholder profits
will go down.

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:15.551
Hey, jerkoff!
Are you a reporter or a shareholder?

01:15:15.677 --> 01:15:16.636
A reporter.

01:15:16.762 --> 01:15:18.679
Well, then stop
spreading their lies!

01:15:19.181 --> 01:15:21.057
What are you doing here, Bougon?

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.394
Calls for tender.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.855
If you want contracts,
you have to bid.

01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:30.191
Wait a minute, you moron!

01:15:30.317 --> 01:15:33.069
Τhe foundations of democracy
will crumble

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:37.365
if the people who fund campaigns
don't get their slice of the pie!

01:15:37.491 --> 01:15:38.950
Your democracy can eat shit!

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:42.453
We're also going to cut
RRSP tax deductions.

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:43.913
And I'll go further.

01:15:44.039 --> 01:15:46.916
If I give a billion dollars
to a company,

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:48.876
instead of them cutting jobs here,

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:51.337
I'll make them cut jobs
in some other country.

01:15:51.463 --> 01:15:52.922
ls that what you wanna hear?

01:15:53.048 --> 01:15:56.092
You're saying that every government
before you screwed us.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.635
That's unacceptable.

01:15:59.888 --> 01:16:01.389
Bring me a beer.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:05.268
I want you to draft a bill
based on this public inquiry,

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:06.602
and fast!

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:16.362
Paul! Τhe establishment
have pulled out the big guns!

01:16:17.281 --> 01:16:18.823
They’re tearing us apart!

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:21.826
ΤHE PEN GOES ΤOO FAR

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:27.582
"Simplistic solutions
that spread cynicism."

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.834
"W... Wh...

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.502
"Where..."

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.421
"Where is our democracy headed

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:36.132
"when a newcomer
can solve all our problems?"

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:38.009
"Gas prices have increased

01:16:38.135 --> 01:16:41.804
"as a result of the instability
created by good governance."

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:45.933
We have to do something.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:48.144
OK.

01:16:48.854 --> 01:16:52.106
We're gonna stop reading the polls.

01:16:52.232 --> 01:16:54.775
Then we're gonna get to work. Go!

01:16:56.778 --> 01:16:58.321
I’ve had enough, Dad.

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:02.074
Oh yeah? You've had enough?

01:17:02.200 --> 01:17:04.493
What about your sister
I just reinstated?

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:09.624
She's sick of it too.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:13.878
And she says
that the Culture Minister

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:15.921
has to go to the theatre.

01:17:35.275 --> 01:17:37.026
If I name you, stay here.

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:39.362
Everyone else, get the hell out.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:44.158
Chabot, Uncle Fred, Μao, Junior.

01:18:03.553 --> 01:18:05.638
Look, I know the theatre sucks.

01:18:07.432 --> 01:18:09.558
But there are things
that suck even more.

01:18:10.018 --> 01:18:11.519
Like life,

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.979
a shitty, boring life.

01:18:14.606 --> 01:18:16.315
Now, that sucks!

01:18:18.026 --> 01:18:19.819
Losers who meet other losers,

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:23.906
have loser children
and create a society of losers!

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:27.660
They’re scandalized
by a fucking swear word,

01:18:27.786 --> 01:18:31.205
but getting screwed by the system
and lied to every day?

01:18:31.331 --> 01:18:32.915
Τhat's just fine!

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:34.917
People do what they can, Paul.

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:37.878
A loser does what he can,

01:18:38.004 --> 01:18:40.214
but that's not enough, is it?

01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:42.425
You're being arrogant, Paul.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:45.302
You're confusing arrogance
and realism, Fred.

01:18:47.514 --> 01:18:49.640
You know what else sucks
even more than the theatre?

01:18:51.309 --> 01:18:56.355
Realizing that your family
and friends are losers too.

01:18:56.481 --> 01:18:58.399
Τhat really fucking sucks!

01:18:58.942 --> 01:19:00.609
You're all traitors!

01:19:16.084 --> 01:19:19.920
And I’ve realized that
I'm the biggest loser of them all.

01:19:22.132 --> 01:19:24.550
I can't even tell
if this is real life.

01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:28.179
I feel like I'm in a movie,
like I'm the butt of the joke.

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:32.558
Τhere's no other explanation.
I'm a character in a god damn movie!

01:19:34.978 --> 01:19:37.313
Sometimes, I’d like
to fire a gun into a crowd

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.774
just to see if real blood comes out.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.408
Gentlemen...

01:19:49.534 --> 01:19:50.910
What do you want?

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:53.245
I’d like to be alone
with the Premier.

01:20:18.563 --> 01:20:20.689
I just met with the big boss.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.442
He says...

01:20:24.569 --> 01:20:26.529
if you don't do what he wants,

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:29.865
he and his big-shot friends
will take all their assets...

01:20:31.451 --> 01:20:33.244
and move down south,

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.745
and that...

01:20:36.498 --> 01:20:39.667
the 1 976 exodus
of corporate headquarters...

01:20:41.002 --> 01:20:44.171
will look like nothing
compared to what's coming.

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:50.594
Unless you sign this.

01:20:51.221 --> 01:20:52.721
What is it?

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:55.641
Your resignation.

01:21:16.204 --> 01:21:19.290
Tell your big boss I dropped
my resignation in the trash.

01:21:21.585 --> 01:21:23.002
Now get the hell out!

01:21:48.862 --> 01:21:51.405
Quebec is facing ruin
thanks to your brother.

01:21:51.531 --> 01:21:52.615
No, it's not!

01:21:52.741 --> 01:21:56.952
He's too proud to back down
from the establishment.

01:21:57.078 --> 01:21:58.329
You know I'm right.

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.748
Do we want Quebec
to fall into ruin?

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:02.041
Of course not.

01:22:05.879 --> 01:22:08.297
He wants more justice
in our society.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.215
But civil war?

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:12.092
Do you think war is just?

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:13.344
Of course not.

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:20.142
Your brother isn't a leader.
He's a yes-man.

01:22:20.852 --> 01:22:22.269
He says yes to everything.

01:22:22.395 --> 01:22:25.522
He says yes to extremists.
He says yes to more justice.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:27.983
He says yes to more freedom.
He's a yes-man!

01:22:29.444 --> 01:22:30.653
Not you, though.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:33.739
I asked you if you were in favour
of war and ruin.

01:22:33.865 --> 01:22:35.783
And what did you say?

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.452
You said no.

01:22:39.621 --> 01:22:41.372
You're a true leader!

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.749
Not a puppet who does whatever--

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:45.459
Don't do that! It bothers me.

01:22:46.002 --> 01:22:47.086
Besides...

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.004
The big boss is convinced

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:52.174
that Quebec needs a leader like you,

01:22:52.300 --> 01:22:54.885
not some guy
who just does what he's told.

01:22:55.011 --> 01:22:57.137
Do you agree?
Of course you do!

01:22:57.263 --> 01:22:59.723
And he's not alone.

01:22:59.849 --> 01:23:05.145
Even freethinkers like Joseph Fecal
and André Onallfours agree.

01:23:05.480 --> 01:23:08.065
It's in tomorrow's editorial.

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:10.150
Τomorrow's paper is out already?

01:23:11.611 --> 01:23:12.903
What do they say?

01:23:13.029 --> 01:23:16.323
Τhat you're the saviour
of democracy!

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:18.701
Really?

01:23:19.869 --> 01:23:22.788
Τhe Bougon government
is in complete disarray.

01:23:22.914 --> 01:23:26.458
Analysts warn that
current political instability

01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:28.585
could lead to a stock market crash.

01:23:28.712 --> 01:23:31.171
Panic is spreading
across the province.

01:23:31.297 --> 01:23:33.507
Here's Roger Denis,
with more on this story.

01:23:33.633 --> 01:23:36.176
It's total chaos out here,

01:23:36.302 --> 01:23:38.470
both on the streets and indoors.

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:44.768
Τhere you are!

01:23:45.353 --> 01:23:47.229
I'm getting killed on social media.

01:23:47.355 --> 01:23:50.649
Facebook is your job!
So get out your phone and fix it!

01:23:51.693 --> 01:23:53.318
Where's your freaking phone?

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:56.113
- I'm taking a break from Facebook.
- Now?

01:23:56.239 --> 01:23:59.825
After a while, reading the crap
people are saying about your dad

01:23:59.951 --> 01:24:01.660
can get you down.

01:24:01.786 --> 01:24:04.913
...a minute of silence
on social media.

01:24:05.248 --> 01:24:10.169
There will be 60 long seconds
of silence on Twitter

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:12.588
as a form of protest.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:17.051
This mass movement is reminiscent
of the biggest revolutions

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:18.927
that have shaped our civilization.

01:24:19.054 --> 01:24:20.012
ls it that bad?

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.431
- The people have no leader.
- Yes.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.683
Panic is setting in.

01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:27.019
It's not your fault, Dad.

01:24:27.145 --> 01:24:29.605
People think
what they're told to think.

01:24:29.731 --> 01:24:33.233
Τhey read it in the paper,
and they don't even question it.

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:37.821
If they're even smart enough
to read the paper.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:47.831
Dad, Quebeckers say
they want change,

01:24:47.957 --> 01:24:49.374
but it's not true.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:51.710
They’re content
with all the bullshit.

01:24:51.836 --> 01:24:54.922
Τhat's why we have to stand up, Μao.
We have to--

01:24:55.757 --> 01:24:59.301
Let's listen to the minute
of silence on Twitter.

01:25:06.476 --> 01:25:08.560
That was the shortest
minute of silence...

01:25:08.686 --> 01:25:09.895
Where are you going?

01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:16.276
I love you, Dad,
but I'm going back home.

01:25:16.402 --> 01:25:20.072
The disinterest, disappointment
and anger of the people--

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:21.782
Shut the hell up!

01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:34.503
Junior!

01:25:52.021 --> 01:25:53.438
Don't even.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.001
What are you doing here, big guy?

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:16.545
I want to talk to you.

01:26:21.467 --> 01:26:22.801
I know...

01:26:24.053 --> 01:26:25.721
I know I can be a damn fooI

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.640
who thinks he's better
than everyone else.

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:31.727
And I know I haven't been
the perfect husband, but...

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:35.397
I love you, Τita...

01:26:37.609 --> 01:26:39.359
and I love our family.

01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:42.487
I’d like you to give me
a second chance.

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:05.886
How do I know
you aren't full of crap?

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:09.014
Let me finish, Τita. Sit down.

01:27:15.688 --> 01:27:17.981
Politics opened my eyes.

01:27:18.858 --> 01:27:21.235
I realized there's more to life
than money.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:22.861
Oh, did you?

01:27:24.739 --> 01:27:27.574
Don't look for Chico.
I sent him to paradise.

01:27:32.121 --> 01:27:34.081
You had him killed?

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:38.460
Τhat is so romantic!

01:27:39.754 --> 01:27:43.507
Of course not. I sent him
to Cuban paradise: Florida.

01:27:43.633 --> 01:27:46.718
I gave his whole family
money and plane tickets.

01:27:46.844 --> 01:27:49.096
I’ve never seen a guy
take off so fast.

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:53.558
Τita, I...

01:27:58.898 --> 01:28:01.149
I don't know if you feel the same,

01:28:02.944 --> 01:28:05.862
but I can't imagine my life
without you in it.

01:28:07.532 --> 01:28:10.784
It's just no fun
when you're not there.

01:28:10.910 --> 01:28:14.663
You gave away everything
for a chance to get me back?

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:31.972
You're such a moron!

01:28:33.349 --> 01:28:35.309
I dumped Chico.

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:37.936
You didn't have
to give him anything!

01:28:38.604 --> 01:28:40.856
- Shit!
- Christ!

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:49.448
Well, I'm a bit pissed
that I wasted all that money...

01:28:51.576 --> 01:28:53.243
but if you kiss me, Τita...

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:55.912
it'll all be worth it.

01:29:03.546 --> 01:29:07.716
I'm going to kiss
every pore on your body,

01:29:07.842 --> 01:29:10.010
starting with your big mouth!

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:11.636
Get over here!

01:29:13.639 --> 01:29:14.765
Wait!

01:29:14.891 --> 01:29:16.975
Since when do you brush your teeth?

01:29:17.101 --> 01:29:18.352
Well...

01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:25.776
Jesus, Τita!

01:29:29.530 --> 01:29:32.199
Just a month
after Paul Bougon's resignation,

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:34.368
the members of the PEN party

01:29:34.494 --> 01:29:37.287
unanimously elected
their new leader,

01:29:37.413 --> 01:29:39.831
Quebec Premier Frédéric Bougon.

01:29:39.957 --> 01:29:43.210
My friends,
the national debt worries me.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:47.756
As Premier,
I'm making it my top priority.

01:29:48.299 --> 01:29:51.093
in order to clean up
the province's finances,

01:29:51.219 --> 01:29:54.554
we will be privatizing Hydro-Québec,

01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:59.476
all natural resources, the roads,
the health system and schools.

01:29:59.602 --> 01:30:01.937
What more could you ask for?

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:03.855
Great kids

01:30:03.981 --> 01:30:06.775
and a husband who pets me a little
before we screw.

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:09.319
It's true, Μa!

01:30:09.445 --> 01:30:12.906
You could be a little more discreet
when you talk about sex.

01:30:13.032 --> 01:30:15.826
Speaking of discretion,
where's your boy?

01:30:16.536 --> 01:30:18.662
- What boy?
- Your baby!

01:30:18.788 --> 01:30:19.788
Shit!

01:30:19.914 --> 01:30:22.124
- I don't believe it!
- Where is he?

01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:24.084
- He's not in his chair!
- Jeez!

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.128
It's all right! He's fine!

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.963
Τhank you, Chabot.

01:30:29.132 --> 01:30:30.966
- Where the hell was he?
- Yeah?

01:30:31.092 --> 01:30:32.342
in Μontreal North.

01:30:32.468 --> 01:30:34.970
A street gang was using him
as a drop site.

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:37.222
You can fit a lot of dope
in a diaper!

01:30:40.351 --> 01:30:41.977
Don't make me laugh!

01:30:44.397 --> 01:30:46.189
Go to bed, Beaudoin!

01:30:49.277 --> 01:30:56.366
VOTE BOUGON

01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:02.330
We support PPPPPPPs:

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:05.167
public-private partnerships,

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:08.420
private profits,
public pain.

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:11.047
We're also privatizing water.

01:31:11.174 --> 01:31:15.677
By handing all of Quebec's water
over to private interests,

01:31:15.803 --> 01:31:19.264
we're ensuring that it will be
well taken care of,

01:31:19.849 --> 01:31:23.435
because private companies
will have no interest in wasting it,

01:31:23.561 --> 01:31:26.605
as it will be worth a whole lot,
believe me.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:30.942
However, health is still
our main priority.

01:31:31.611 --> 01:31:34.154
But citizens
have to do their part too.

01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:36.740
Those who are in good health

01:31:36.866 --> 01:31:39.784
are the people who take good care
of themselves.

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:42.078
Τhey will therefore
be given priority

01:31:42.205 --> 01:31:45.457
in the health system as a reward.

01:31:45.583 --> 01:31:49.461
After that, if there's still room,
we'll take care of the sick.

01:31:53.424 --> 01:31:57.511
Of course, another priority
is the environment,

01:31:57.637 --> 01:31:59.596
for future generations.

01:31:59.722 --> 01:32:03.808
But we still have to stimulate
the economy through consumption.

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:09.314
What doesn't kill you
only makes you stronger.

01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.984
So I think it's important
to challenge the environment

01:32:13.110 --> 01:32:16.571
by pumping it full of gases
and really polluting it,

01:32:16.697 --> 01:32:18.907
while being careful
not to kill it.

01:32:19.033 --> 01:32:22.869
Τhat way,
it will be that much stronger.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:31.086
Another priority
is to attract multinationals

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:35.048
by giving them
our natural resources, tax breaks...

01:32:36.259 --> 01:32:40.887
and other incentives
with taxpayer money.

01:32:41.013 --> 01:32:45.100
Τhat way, those companies
will hire people here,

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:47.435
and pay them salaries,

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:51.189
and those people
will pay taxes here.

01:32:51.315 --> 01:32:52.899
And with that money,

01:32:53.025 --> 01:32:55.527
we can attract more multinationals,

01:32:55.653 --> 01:33:00.657
who will in turn distribute
their wealth.

01:33:05.663 --> 01:33:07.330
Τhank you, Μr. Speaker.
