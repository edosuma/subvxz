NO, NO.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

42:43.145 --> 42:44.855
OH!

42:45.022 --> 42:46.565
OOH!

42:46.732 --> 42:48.609
OH!

42:48.776 --> 42:50.611
OH! GEE,
I'M SORRY, GIRLS.

42:50.778 --> 42:53.906
I WAS GOING TO COOK YOU UP A
REAL EDWARD SPECIAL TONIGHT.

42:54.073 --> 42:56.700
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO BE
ABLE TO BEND OVER THE FIRE.

42:56.867 --> 42:58.577
OH, DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL COOK SUPPER.

42:58.744 --> 43:00.871
WON'T TASTE AS GOOD,
BUT WE WON'T STARVE.

43:01.038 --> 43:03.791
OUGHT TO BE ALL RIGHT BY THE
TIME YOUR FOLKS GET BACK.

43:03.958 --> 43:05.751
WOULDN'T WANT THEM
TO SEE ME LIKE THIS.

43:05.918 --> 43:08.337
THEY'D THINK THEY LEFT YOU
GIRLS IN PRETTY POOR HANDS.

43:08.504 --> 43:09.880
WE'LL
GET ALONG FINE.

43:10.047 --> 43:11.715
I'LL TAKE CARE OF CARRIE, AND
LAURA CAN DO THE CHORES.

43:11.882 --> 43:13.676
WHY DO I
HAVE TO DO THE CHORES?

43:13.842 --> 43:15.052
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THE YOUNGEST.

43:15.219 --> 43:16.178
CARRIE'S
THE YOUNGEST.

43:16.345 --> 43:18.013
THAT'S SILLY,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

43:18.180 --> 43:20.766
[PANS RATTLING]
ALL RIGHT, QUIT YOUR SQUABBLING.

43:22.726 --> 43:25.145
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO BE TAKING CARE OF CARRIE.

43:25.312 --> 43:27.731
I WOULD, IF
YOU'D STOP ARGUING.

43:27.898 --> 43:31.235
Edwards: NOW, YOU TWO CARRY ON
LIKE THIS WHEN YOUR MA'S HERE?

43:31.402 --> 43:32.236
NO, SIR.

43:32.403 --> 43:33.279
NO, SIR.

43:33.445 --> 43:37.199
WELL, I'M YOUR MA NOW,
SO STOP IT.

43:37.366 --> 43:39.076
OH...

43:56.719 --> 44:00.931
AH, HELLO, LAURA! OH, I SEE
YOU'VE GOT SOME EGGS FOR ME.

44:01.098 --> 44:02.391
ONLY 9 TODAY.

44:02.558 --> 44:04.059
OH, THE HENS
TAPERING OFF?

44:04.226 --> 44:07.187
NO. SOME GOT BROKEN
THE OTHER NIGHT.

44:07.354 --> 44:09.732
WELL, DID YOU WANT ME
TO MARK THESE DOWN,

44:09.898 --> 44:11.608
OR YOU HAVE
SOME SHOPPING TO DO?

44:11.775 --> 44:15.612
I GUESS YOU CAN WRITE THEM DOWN.
MA WILL BE BACK TOMORROW.

44:17.072 --> 44:19.700
Oleson: WELL,
MY, HOW TIME FLIES.

44:19.867 --> 44:21.493
YOU KNOW, IF I
DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

44:21.660 --> 44:25.039
I'D SAY THAT WAS YOUR MA
COMING THIS WAY RIGHT NOW.

44:27.416 --> 44:29.626
DON'T LET THEM
COME HOME, PLEASE?

44:29.793 --> 44:31.462
WE'RE NOT READY
FOR THEM!

44:31.628 --> 44:34.006
KEEP THEM HERE
AWHILE, PLEASE?

44:39.219 --> 44:40.804
Oleson: AH! HOW WAS
THE TRIP, INGALLS?

44:40.971 --> 44:42.973
Charles: IT WAS GREAT, BUT
IT'S GOOD To BE BACK.

44:43.140 --> 44:44.475
I'LL HELP YOU
UNLOAD.

44:44.641 --> 44:46.810
I WAS HOPING TO DROP
CAROLINE AT HOME FIRST.

44:46.977 --> 44:49.271
UH, I DON'T SEE THE,
UH, FLOUR SACKS.

44:49.438 --> 44:51.190
WELL, DON'T WORRY.
THEY'RE IN THERE.

44:51.357 --> 44:52.483
THEY'RE DOWN BELOW
EVERYTHING.

44:52.649 --> 44:54.318
WHAT, DO YOU NEED
THE FLOUR?

44:54.485 --> 44:55.694
OH, I SURE DO.

44:55.861 --> 44:57.988
I GOT A CUSTOMER TAKING
OFF FOR DAKOTA TERRITORY.

44:58.155 --> 44:59.823
HE'S REALLY CHAMPING
TO GET GOING.

44:59.990 --> 45:03.410
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO UNLOAD THE WAGON.

45:06.830 --> 45:08.415
WON'T TAKE LONG.

45:20.719 --> 45:21.804
Mary: LAURA!

45:21.970 --> 45:24.223
PUT CARRIE'S
CLEAN DRESS ON HER!

45:24.390 --> 45:26.058
COME ON, CARRIE.

45:27.393 --> 45:28.644
HOW YOU FEELING?

45:28.811 --> 45:31.397
OH, NEVER BETTER.
NEVER BETTER.

46:00.342 --> 46:02.886
Edwards: OH! THE BROOM!
THE BROOM!

46:05.013 --> 46:06.932
Edwards:
HA! WE DONE IT.

46:07.099 --> 46:08.392
OOH.

46:08.559 --> 46:10.102
NEAT AS A PIN.

46:10.269 --> 46:11.728
HEY!

46:13.772 --> 46:15.232
HERE THEY COME!

46:15.399 --> 46:17.234
COME ON, CARRIE.

46:19.570 --> 46:22.239
Mary and Laura: MA! PA!

46:32.124 --> 46:33.959
Charles: WHOA!

46:35.627 --> 46:36.962
Charles: THERE THEY ARE!

46:37.129 --> 46:38.547
Caroline, laughing:
OH!

46:38.714 --> 46:41.049
HI, CARRIE!

46:41.216 --> 46:42.968
HI, HALF-PINT.

46:43.135 --> 46:45.512
[EVERYONE LAUGHING]

46:45.679 --> 46:46.805
Caroline: LAURA!

46:46.972 --> 46:48.765
Laura: DID YOU
GET US A SURPRISE?

46:48.932 --> 46:50.726
Charles: WELL, I THINK
WE JUST MIGHT BE ABLE

46:50.893 --> 46:53.145
TO FIND A LITTLE SURPRISE
BACK HERE IN THESE BAGS.

46:53.312 --> 46:55.981
GOT TO WAIT TILL
WE GO IN THE HOUSE.

46:56.148 --> 46:57.691
HEY, EDWARDS!

46:57.858 --> 46:59.485
HI!

47:00.944 --> 47:03.947
Caroline: WELL, EVERYBODY
LOOKS BLOOMING WITH HEALTH.

47:04.114 --> 47:05.908
Edwards:
OH, SURE, SURE.

47:06.074 --> 47:08.660
WHAT DID YOU THINK
WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?

47:08.827 --> 47:10.704
WELL, I JUST CAN'T
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

47:10.871 --> 47:12.206
OH, WELL,
IT WASN'T NOTHING.

47:12.372 --> 47:13.832
THE HOUSE KIND OF
RUN ITSELF.

47:13.999 --> 47:15.501
YOU SEE?
WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

47:15.667 --> 47:17.711
DIDN'T YOU MISS US
JUST A LITTLE BIT?

47:17.878 --> 47:19.254
SURE, MA.

47:19.421 --> 47:21.173
JUST
A LITTLE BIT.

47:21.340 --> 47:23.133
COME ON, GIRLS.
LET'S GO INSIDE.

47:23.300 --> 47:24.843
I WANT YOU TO TELL ME

47:25.010 --> 47:27.387
ABOUT EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENED WHILE WE WERE AWAY.

47:27.554 --> 47:29.056
AND THANKS AGAIN.

47:29.223 --> 47:31.225
Charles: DON'T WORRY. I'LL BRING
THE PRESENTS IN IN A MINUTE.

47:31.391 --> 47:33.143
I KNEW EVERYTHING WAS
GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT,

47:33.310 --> 47:35.562
BUT YOU KNOW THE WAY WOMEN
ARE--THEY'RE NOT AROUND EVERY MINUTE,

47:35.729 --> 47:37.606
THEY THINK THE ROOF'S
GOING TO CAVE IN.

47:37.773 --> 47:40.442
IT WASN'T NOTHING.
SAY, HOW WAS THE TRIP?

47:40.609 --> 47:42.903
OH, IT--IT WAS FINE.
IT WAS MARVELOUS.

47:43.070 --> 47:44.905
REALLY, I CAN'T
EVEN TELL YOU.

47:45.072 --> 47:46.865
IT WAS A SECOND
HONEYMOON FOR US.

47:47.032 --> 47:48.992
DIDN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THE KIDS.

47:49.159 --> 47:50.536
OH, GOOD, GOOD.

47:50.702 --> 47:52.412
I'D BETTER BRING THE
PRESENTS IN THE HOUSE.

47:52.579 --> 47:54.498
WHY DON'T YOU COME
ON IN FOR A MINUTE?

47:54.665 --> 47:56.458
NO, THANK YOU,
JUST THE SAME.

47:56.625 --> 47:58.335
WELL, THANKS A LOT.
