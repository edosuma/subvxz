Original Air Date on March 3 2013

00:27.276 --> 00:30.228
Hmm. I can't believe
you're reading

00:30.262 --> 00:32.714
when there's so much
great stuff on TV.

00:32.747 --> 00:34.532
Hmm, you're right.

00:34.567 --> 00:35.867
It is the golden age

00:35.901 --> 00:38.536
of well-written,
brilliantly-acted TV shows.

00:38.571 --> 00:41.239
Writing is
for bathroom walls,

00:41.273 --> 00:43.708
and acting is for
getting out of DUIs.

00:43.742 --> 00:46.945
The only reason TV exists
is for reality shows

00:46.979 --> 00:51.216
about white-trash scuzzbags
doing subhuman, made-up jobs.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.384
Um... Oh. Ah.

00:53.419 --> 00:55.487
Eek. Yikes. Oh.

00:55.521 --> 00:57.388
Ew. Ugh. Well...

00:57.423 --> 00:59.390
Ew. Ah. Dad!

00:59.425 --> 01:01.392
No. Ah! Oh.

01:01.427 --> 01:02.760
Seriously? Ah!

01:04.997 --> 01:07.432
Ooh, jail music!

01:07.466 --> 01:09.250
<i>When storage lockers</i>
<i>are abandoned,</i>

01:09.285 --> 01:11.603
<i>we open them up!</i>

01:11.637 --> 01:14.305
<i>Our expert bidders face off</i>
<i>in the ultimate contest</i>

01:14.340 --> 01:17.292
<i>to discover the amazing</i>
<i>treasures within.</i>

01:17.326 --> 01:20.645
<i>This is</i> Storage Battles!

01:21.647 --> 01:23.648
I'll give it one marathon.

01:26.185 --> 01:29.287
I don't care what people say,
I am feeling this unit.

01:29.321 --> 01:31.723
No one feels out a unit like CJ.

01:31.757 --> 01:34.692
Not Bubba,
not Debbie and Danny, no one.

01:34.727 --> 01:36.494
Mostly worthless junk:

01:36.529 --> 01:39.197
family photo albums,
home movies,

01:39.231 --> 01:40.999
ah, kids' drawings.

01:41.033 --> 01:43.735
Eh, just some nobody.

01:43.769 --> 01:45.236
Here we go, here we go.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.038
Bubble wrap.

01:47.072 --> 01:49.507
If there's wrap, it ain't crap.

01:49.542 --> 01:50.742
Bingo!

01:50.776 --> 01:52.210
Antique bayonets.

01:52.244 --> 01:55.813
Oh! I'm talking World War One,
Spanish American War.

01:55.848 --> 01:58.149
Crimea, baby.

01:58.183 --> 02:01.819
Well, if you found the right
buyer on the right day,

02:01.854 --> 02:04.556
and he knew nothing
about bayonets,

02:04.590 --> 02:07.425
you might sell them
for possibly $500.

02:07.459 --> 02:09.160
Definitely $500.

02:09.193 --> 02:10.395
$500!

02:10.429 --> 02:11.763
Five hundy!

02:11.797 --> 02:13.197
Five hundaminidos!

02:17.269 --> 02:18.436
High-five me, Marge.

02:18.470 --> 02:19.737
I want to know
what it's for.

02:19.772 --> 02:21.105
Too late.

02:21.140 --> 02:24.175
We're gonna get rich
off the poor and forgetful.

02:24.209 --> 02:25.710
And dead people.

02:29.448 --> 02:31.449
I bet I win a locker
full of treasure,

02:31.483 --> 02:35.119
like a solid gold bar of silver
or Picasso's TV.

02:35.154 --> 02:36.621
Oh, no, no, no.

02:36.655 --> 02:39.324
It is I who will be watching
Picasso's TV tonight!

02:41.393 --> 02:42.727
Looks like
you're not the only

02:42.761 --> 02:44.629
predatory opportunist
in town.

02:45.664 --> 02:47.065
There's other P.O.'s?!

02:47.099 --> 02:49.667
Uh-oh, better put on
my game shades.

02:56.775 --> 02:58.476
Do I hear $50? Let me get $50.

02:58.510 --> 02:59.444
Oh, yeah!

02:59.478 --> 03:00.745
$100. Is there $100 out there?

03:00.779 --> 03:02.246
Looking for $100.
Thank you!

03:02.281 --> 03:03.915
$150, $150.

03:03.949 --> 03:05.116
Do I have $200?

03:05.150 --> 03:06.985
$250. Do I hear...

03:07.019 --> 03:08.086
$350.
Yarr!

03:08.120 --> 03:09.821
Four. Do I hear $400?

03:09.855 --> 03:11.089
$450.
Bidding!

03:11.123 --> 03:12.256
$500.

03:12.291 --> 03:13.725
$550.
Skinner!

03:13.759 --> 03:15.493
$600.

03:15.527 --> 03:16.728
$650.

03:16.762 --> 03:18.630
$650 going once,
$650 going twice...

03:21.300 --> 03:24.068
$1,000.

03:24.103 --> 03:25.403
$1,000 going once, going twice.

03:25.437 --> 03:27.505
Sold to the man who didn't
wait for the bidding

03:27.539 --> 03:29.107
to get anywhere near $1,000!

03:29.141 --> 03:32.210
In the money game,
cash is king.

03:38.651 --> 03:41.753
We spent $1,000 on a
bunch of old boxes?

03:41.787 --> 03:43.688
You won't be laughing
when these boxes

03:43.722 --> 03:45.456
are full of
priceless treasures.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.059
I wasn't laughing,
I was being worried.

03:51.063 --> 03:52.363
Feather boas?

03:52.398 --> 03:54.332
Mine's full of
hand mirrors.

03:54.366 --> 03:56.501
I've got perfume spritzers.

03:56.535 --> 03:58.469
Makeup and baby oil.

03:58.504 --> 04:00.171
Tights? Robes?

04:00.205 --> 04:03.324
Oh, this stupid locker must have
belonged to some old lady.

04:03.359 --> 04:06.260
"Property of
Abraham J. Simpson"?

04:06.295 --> 04:08.162
This is Grampa's stuff.

04:08.197 --> 04:10.998
Why would my man-dad
have lady stuff?

04:11.033 --> 04:12.900
It's not all lady stuff.

04:12.935 --> 04:17.572
Look at all these
fitness publications.

04:18.574 --> 04:20.141
Beefcake mags?

04:21.810 --> 04:25.046
I think your dad might be gay.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.014
Oh, that's insane.

04:27.049 --> 04:29.167
My dad was
married to a woman

04:29.201 --> 04:32.620
who left him because he ignored
her needs for decades.

04:32.654 --> 04:36.991
Ah, my gay dad
is gay for gays.

04:43.365 --> 04:45.800
I think this is great.

04:45.834 --> 04:47.902
Old gay men
are adorable.

04:47.936 --> 04:51.038
Like wrinkle dogs in a
wrinkle dog calendar.

04:51.073 --> 04:53.040
Those are pretty cute.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.810
Your dad's been in the
closet for so long,

04:55.844 --> 04:59.197
he probably doesn't know how
tolerant society's become.

04:59.231 --> 05:03.701
They even had a gay float
in the Pride Parade last year.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.571
My dad has
always been so angry.

05:06.605 --> 05:08.873
Maybe if we help him
be who he is,

05:08.907 --> 05:10.608
he'll finally be happy.

05:10.642 --> 05:12.110
Oh, Homie,

05:12.144 --> 05:15.079
you're so enlightened.

05:18.317 --> 05:21.586
Yeah, gay rights
are human rights, baby.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.908
Are you sure you're not
just doing all this

05:26.942 --> 05:28.676
because it's cool
to be accepting

05:28.710 --> 05:30.077
of a gay family member?

05:30.112 --> 05:32.513
Oh, honey, that's
just silly.

05:32.548 --> 05:34.298
This'll show
Helen Lovejoy.

05:34.333 --> 05:37.435
Always bragging about
her he-she cousin.

05:37.469 --> 05:41.606
Abe, we found
your storage locker.

05:41.640 --> 05:42.940
It's okay, Dad.

05:42.975 --> 05:45.443
We know the truth,
and we love you.

05:45.477 --> 05:46.778
What?!

05:46.812 --> 05:49.430
The contents of that locker
are my private business!

05:49.465 --> 05:50.598
Get out!

05:50.632 --> 05:51.966
Just admit who you are,

05:52.000 --> 05:54.101
and you can find new love.

05:54.136 --> 05:56.037
If you don't
want to die alone,

05:56.071 --> 05:58.239
come out of your room.

05:58.273 --> 06:01.709
Love... love...

06:01.760 --> 06:03.344
love... love...

06:06.265 --> 06:07.715
Hi, Marge.

06:07.749 --> 06:10.785
I was just taking Stanlerina
to get her hormone shots.

06:10.819 --> 06:11.986
Oh.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.388
Your father wasted
his whole life being married

06:14.423 --> 06:16.157
to your mother
and having you.

06:16.191 --> 06:19.260
We've got to find him a
boyfriend before it's too late.

06:19.294 --> 06:21.596
Why don't you put a
personal ad on the Internet?

06:21.630 --> 06:23.664
That's how young people
date these days.

06:23.699 --> 06:24.832
It's weird that you don't

06:24.867 --> 06:26.567
consider yourself
a young person.

06:26.602 --> 06:27.401
I know.

06:27.436 --> 06:28.603
It's weird to me, too.

06:28.637 --> 06:30.671
"Help me out of the closet.

06:30.706 --> 06:33.274
"Wonderful older man
seeks life partner

06:33.308 --> 06:35.810
before rapidly-encroaching
death."

06:35.844 --> 06:36.911
No fatties.

06:36.945 --> 06:38.613
How about <i>some</i> fatties?

06:38.647 --> 06:39.614
Fine.

06:39.648 --> 06:41.015
Okay, post this under

06:41.049 --> 06:42.817
"Men Seeking Men."

06:42.851 --> 06:44.285
But what subheading?

06:44.319 --> 06:45.920
Hmm, nothing too serious.

06:45.954 --> 06:48.923
Here we go, "Casual Encounters."

06:48.957 --> 06:51.959
Perfect! No pressure.

06:53.228 --> 06:54.929
I hope someone
saw our ad.

06:54.963 --> 06:57.698
If I can't find my father a man
to kiss and cuddle,

06:57.733 --> 06:59.333
then I've failed as a son.

07:00.569 --> 07:01.569
Someone's coming.

07:02.871 --> 07:05.373
Are you
"Wrinkled and Romantic"?

07:05.407 --> 07:08.009
Huh? What the heck are you
talking about, Spectacles?

07:08.043 --> 07:10.211
Oh, I've been hung up
on someone for years,

07:10.245 --> 07:12.346
but I'm trapped
in the friend zone.

07:12.381 --> 07:14.448
It's time for me to move on.

07:14.483 --> 07:15.516
So move on.

07:15.551 --> 07:16.717
You're blocking the ducks.

07:16.752 --> 07:18.920
Don't you want
to be happy, Abe?

07:18.954 --> 07:22.690
Admit who you are,
a wonderful gay man.

07:24.343 --> 07:25.443
What?!

07:25.477 --> 07:27.144
I don't ride sidesaddle!

07:27.179 --> 07:29.013
I'm straight as a submarine!

07:29.047 --> 07:31.482
Then how do you
explain this?

07:31.516 --> 07:33.117
Oh, hello, Smithers.

07:33.151 --> 07:36.053
Fancy seeing you
in Casual Encounter Park.

07:38.257 --> 07:40.274
You're Glamorous Godfrey!

07:40.309 --> 07:41.976
Who?

07:42.010 --> 07:44.612
Glamorous Godfrey was the most
famous wrestler in the world.

07:44.646 --> 07:45.880
And you are he!

07:45.914 --> 07:47.715
Is this true?

07:47.749 --> 07:49.617
Behold.

07:49.651 --> 07:51.085
Look at
all this wrestling crap.

07:51.119 --> 07:52.236
Ah.
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

07:52.271 --> 07:54.972
Fine, I was Glamorous Godfrey.

07:57.175 --> 07:58.209
What's wrong?

07:58.243 --> 08:01.045
I so wanted
him to be gay.

08:01.079 --> 08:04.081
Well, on V.E. Day, I
kissed a man by mistake.

08:04.116 --> 08:05.449
Thank you.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.647
You were
a world-famous wrestler?

08:09.681 --> 08:11.482
Spill the beans, old man.

08:11.516 --> 08:12.650
Word beans!

08:12.684 --> 08:14.885
Oh, all right, I'll tell you.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.021
It was the 1950s.

08:17.055 --> 08:19.056
Oh, those things?

08:19.091 --> 08:21.492
It <i>was the heyday</i>
<i>of pro wrestling.</i>

08:21.526 --> 08:24.261
<i>You could make good money</i>
<i>if you were the manly mixture</i>

08:24.296 --> 08:26.731
<i>of strong and fat</i>
<i>we called beefy.</i>

08:26.765 --> 08:30.534
<i>Good guys were called</i>
<i>"baby faces."</i>

08:30.569 --> 08:33.320
<i>And bad guys</i>
<i>were called "heels."</i>

08:33.355 --> 08:37.224
<i>I was the king of the heels,</i>
<i>Glamorous Godfrey.</i>

08:37.259 --> 08:38.509
How dare he!

08:38.543 --> 08:40.410
That was drinking milk!

08:40.445 --> 08:42.897
<i>My motto was "Always cheat."</i>

08:48.136 --> 08:52.957
<i>But the thing that really drove</i>
<i>them crazy was my vanity.</i>

08:52.991 --> 08:55.893
You are the luckiest people
in the world.

08:55.927 --> 08:58.062
You get to look at me.

09:02.501 --> 09:05.736
Grampa, you were
the original bad boy.

09:05.771 --> 09:09.540
Yeah, I was boastful before
all your football showboaters,

09:09.574 --> 09:12.359
rap music-ers and
TV beach Italians.

09:12.394 --> 09:15.262
But there was a down side
to being hated:

09:15.297 --> 09:17.031
being hated.

09:19.000 --> 09:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:27.592 --> 09:29.660
<i>Well, I just couldn't take it.</i>

09:35.834 --> 09:38.836
Being despised was
no way to live.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.904
Pshaw!

09:39.938 --> 09:41.172
Pshaw, I say!

09:41.206 --> 09:42.706
Pshaw yourself!

09:42.741 --> 09:44.475
Pshaw!
Pshaw!

09:44.509 --> 09:45.810
Homer, do something!

09:45.844 --> 09:47.611
They're killing each other!

09:47.646 --> 09:49.580
Oh, yeah?

09:49.614 --> 09:52.399
The world may have despised
Glamorous Godfrey,

09:52.434 --> 09:54.702
but that conceited
mother-puncher was my hero.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.339
Please, Abe, let
me buy you dinner

09:58.373 --> 10:00.674
in exchange for a few
tales of the golden age

10:00.709 --> 10:02.076
of professional
grappling.

10:02.110 --> 10:06.797
Sorry, I been trying to forget
those days for 50 years.

10:06.832 --> 10:08.165
But, Grampa,

10:08.200 --> 10:10.100
I want to hear about
old-time wrestling, too.

10:10.135 --> 10:12.486
Well, it looks like
you've made a new fan.

10:12.521 --> 10:15.322
It'd be a shame to
let him down, hmm?

10:15.357 --> 10:16.323
Fine.

10:16.358 --> 10:17.791
One dinner.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.093
Excellent.

10:19.127 --> 10:21.278
So we'll take the boy
and make a night of it.

10:21.313 --> 10:22.379
I don't know.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.047
Should I really
let the men

10:24.065 --> 10:25.916
who ruined my
past and present

10:25.951 --> 10:28.469
hang out with the kid who's
going to ruin my future?

10:28.503 --> 10:29.637
I'll bring you home
my dessert.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.138
Text me the choices.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.840
<i>I can't believe I'm on the town</i>

10:32.874 --> 10:35.776
with Glamorous Godfrey
himself.

10:35.810 --> 10:39.163
Tell me of your epic battle
with Swedish Olaf Johannsen.

10:39.197 --> 10:42.917
Oh, yeah,
"The Fury of the Fjords."

10:50.458 --> 10:52.509
You settled
that Swede's meatballs.

10:52.544 --> 10:54.995
What I wouldn't give
to see Glamorous Godfrey

10:55.030 --> 10:56.530
in action once more.

10:56.565 --> 10:58.032
Would you ever consider

10:58.066 --> 10:59.900
throwing your wig
back into the ring?

10:59.935 --> 11:01.969
Go back to
being a villain?

11:02.003 --> 11:03.370
Oh, forget that.

11:03.405 --> 11:06.173
Being hated is the
worst feeling there is.

11:07.275 --> 11:08.909
You've got it all wrong,
my friend.

11:08.944 --> 11:10.477
Once you see it my way,

11:10.512 --> 11:12.813
you'll understand
that being hated

11:12.847 --> 11:15.316
is the greatest
feeling in the world.

as long as everybody
wants me dead.

12:41.703 --> 12:43.037
Okay, Burns!

12:43.071 --> 12:46.240
Glamorous Godfrey
will wrestle again!

12:47.475 --> 12:50.878
That cocaine I ordered
is taking forever!

12:56.220 --> 12:58.002
I can't wait to see Grampa
kick some ass.

12:58.004 --> 12:59.572
He's always pretended
to be boring,

12:59.606 --> 13:01.474
but he's really
a straight-up psycho.

13:01.508 --> 13:04.260
Your grandfather
is not psycho.

13:04.294 --> 13:07.463
The only thing he's
"straight-up" is loves you.

13:07.497 --> 13:10.199
Gorilla Joe, Gorilla Sam,
Gorilla Pete,

13:10.233 --> 13:12.368
Ook and Eek, the Gorilla Twins.

13:12.402 --> 13:15.204
Where did Mr. Burns dig up
all these old wrestlers?

13:15.238 --> 13:16.605
Apparently, old folks homes

13:16.640 --> 13:19.075
are full of people
that used to be things.

13:19.109 --> 13:21.594
Just like you and me.
Swear to God.

13:21.628 --> 13:24.096
Welcome, aficionados
of the roped ring,

13:24.131 --> 13:26.749
to a thrilling night
of senior-on-senior action.

13:36.860 --> 13:38.844
Folding chairs!
Folding chairs!

13:38.879 --> 13:40.780
Can't hit somebody when
they're not looking

13:40.814 --> 13:42.248
without a
folding chair!

13:42.282 --> 13:43.249
Can I have one?

13:43.283 --> 13:44.300
Can I?
Fine.

13:44.334 --> 13:45.601
Ha!

13:45.635 --> 13:47.620
And now our main event.

13:47.654 --> 13:50.539
In this corner,
Baby Face Palooka.

13:50.574 --> 13:51.807
And entering the ring,

13:51.842 --> 13:54.577
America's original
vainglorious bastard,

13:54.611 --> 13:56.278
Glamorous Godfrey!

14:05.288 --> 14:07.273
Yes,
feel the hatred.

14:07.307 --> 14:10.943
It makes you strong,
powerful, alive.

14:10.977 --> 14:14.380
You are the luckiest people
in the world!

14:14.414 --> 14:16.382
You get to look at me!

14:22.239 --> 14:23.439
You show 'em, Godfrey!

14:23.473 --> 14:25.508
You're the prettiest
old man in the world!

14:25.542 --> 14:28.077
Why do you think
bad guys are so cool?

14:28.111 --> 14:30.279
Why do you still have
a thing for Nelson?

14:30.313 --> 14:32.114
I'm not!
That's ridiculous!

14:32.149 --> 14:34.433
I just...
it's that... he, uh...

14:34.468 --> 14:37.119
He's a rebel,
and only I can change him!

14:57.707 --> 14:59.808
It's so sad that
Grampa has to cheat

14:59.843 --> 15:02.878
instead of relying on his
God-given wrestling skills.

15:02.913 --> 15:05.948
What kind of person
revels in disapproval?

15:05.982 --> 15:09.785
What kind of
person, indeed.

15:13.990 --> 15:17.960
It's the prettiest boy
in Springfield, Bart Simpson!

15:17.994 --> 15:19.695
What's going on?

15:23.567 --> 15:26.135
You are the luckiest people
in the world!

15:26.169 --> 15:27.570
You get to look at me!

15:31.758 --> 15:33.058
Hey!

15:37.531 --> 15:39.932
Hey, Simpson, tell your
kid to quit showboating.

15:39.966 --> 15:43.469
I've never seen anyone
so full of self-regard!

15:43.503 --> 15:46.639
And I've worked
with Bob Balaban!

15:52.829 --> 15:55.764
Your behavior at that
game was unacceptable!

15:55.799 --> 15:58.817
You're lucky they gave you
your participant trophy!

15:58.852 --> 16:01.186
I got one
just for watching the game.

16:03.189 --> 16:05.991
Listen, getting people riled up
is what heels do.

16:06.026 --> 16:07.626
Heel? Oh, no.

16:07.661 --> 16:09.662
Tell me you're not
trying to be like Grampa!

16:09.696 --> 16:11.096
Well, sure I am.

16:11.131 --> 16:12.698
I always thought
Grampa was lame,

16:12.732 --> 16:14.433
but he's
really awesome!

16:14.467 --> 16:16.569
Your grandfather
is super lame!

16:16.603 --> 16:19.371
I mean, if he wasn't
a terrible father,

16:19.406 --> 16:21.507
what's my excuse for this?

16:24.878 --> 16:27.413
I know your grandpa
seems exciting now,

16:27.447 --> 16:29.915
but all that preening
and cheating--

16:29.950 --> 16:33.786
those turnbuckle antics are
not gonna make him happy.

16:36.306 --> 16:38.240
Burnsy, I can't
remember the last time

16:38.275 --> 16:40.259
I was so happy!

16:41.394 --> 16:43.362
You grandson-
ruining fiend!

16:43.396 --> 16:45.414
Look what your
number one fan

16:45.448 --> 16:47.049
did at show-and-tell!

16:48.118 --> 16:49.785
Wait. Ow.

16:49.819 --> 16:51.854
Ah. Wait.

16:51.888 --> 16:53.856
Who would film
such a thing?

16:53.890 --> 16:55.374
It's found footage!

16:55.408 --> 16:58.143
So what? We could use
another winner in this family!

16:58.178 --> 16:59.595
How are you
a winner?

16:59.629 --> 17:01.597
You're cheating
in a fake sport.

17:01.631 --> 17:02.931
Fake? Ridiculous.

17:02.966 --> 17:04.583
If professional wrestling
were fake,

17:04.617 --> 17:07.486
that would make every fan
in the history of the sport

17:07.520 --> 17:09.954
a complete and utter moron.

17:11.590 --> 17:12.958
Mercy.

17:12.992 --> 17:16.028
You know, I've always had
a keen eye for tiny talent.

17:16.061 --> 17:18.464
Perhaps you and the lad
could tag-team up.

17:18.498 --> 17:19.798
Wrestle with Bart?

17:19.833 --> 17:22.800
Well, he ain't beefy,
but he is infuriating,

17:22.836 --> 17:24.703
and you can't
teach infuriating.

17:24.738 --> 17:26.805
Monty, you're
a genius!

17:26.839 --> 17:29.308
Bart cannot be an
old-time wrestler!

17:29.342 --> 17:33.362
As your inattentive son, and
your incompetent employee,

17:33.396 --> 17:34.913
I forbid it!

17:34.948 --> 17:39.084
Oh, why does everything
I forbid always happen?

17:44.599 --> 17:47.267
So, Beautiful,
you got your moves memorized?

17:47.301 --> 17:48.935
You know it,
Glamorous!

17:48.970 --> 17:50.704
Eye gouge! Ear bite!
Folding chair!

17:50.738 --> 17:52.839
Hair pull! Face-fart!
Flying face-fart!

17:52.874 --> 17:54.858
And then I start
fighting dirty.

17:56.043 --> 17:57.778
They're gonna
hate you so much.

17:59.197 --> 18:00.764
Oh, I get it.

18:00.798 --> 18:04.401
You're here to tell the kid he
can't wrestle with his grandpa.

18:06.554 --> 18:08.872
I don't care if Bart
is a wrestler,

18:08.906 --> 18:13.210
a busboy, or even
a stoplight squeegee man,

18:13.244 --> 18:16.046
as long as
he's a nice person.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.949
But if he gets too much
attention for acting bad,

18:18.983 --> 18:21.735
he might turn bad
on the inside.

18:21.769 --> 18:23.653
Eh, that's women-talk.

18:23.688 --> 18:27.557
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to comb out my curls!

18:27.592 --> 18:30.961
One... two... three...

18:33.865 --> 18:37.067
Beautiful Bart,
can I have your autograph?

18:37.101 --> 18:38.902
Sure. Here you go.

18:42.573 --> 18:44.107
Eh, hey, Bart,

18:44.142 --> 18:46.543
leave some of that bad
attitude for the ring.

18:46.577 --> 18:48.945
The world is my ring now.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.853
In this corner,
for truth and justice,

18:56.888 --> 18:58.688
Captain Flag and Half-Mast.

19:00.725 --> 19:04.094
Now entering the ring,
the first family of foul play,

19:04.128 --> 19:06.396
Glamorous Godfrey
and Beautiful Bart!

19:09.717 --> 19:11.384
You all stink!

19:17.508 --> 19:20.527
Glamorous Godfrey is dead!

19:24.148 --> 19:26.783
I am Honest Abe!

19:30.488 --> 19:33.623
And this is Laddie Liberty!

19:33.658 --> 19:35.192
What are you doing?

19:35.226 --> 19:37.510
I ain't a heel no more,
I'm a good guy.

19:37.545 --> 19:38.945
And you're a baby-face.

19:38.980 --> 19:40.480
But-but what about
the cheating?

19:40.514 --> 19:41.548
No more cheating.

19:41.582 --> 19:42.649
And the preening?

19:42.683 --> 19:43.817
No more preening.

19:43.851 --> 19:45.051
But I'm so pretty.

19:45.086 --> 19:47.287
That's for others to say now.

19:47.321 --> 19:49.022
What are you doing,
Godfrey?

19:49.056 --> 19:52.292
You're a villain, not some
bullet-brained rail-splitter.

19:52.326 --> 19:55.312
Without someone to hate, there's
no excitement, no thrill.

19:55.346 --> 19:57.981
I don't care.
My grandson's soul is at stake.

19:58.015 --> 20:00.317
How dare you.
I wrote a song for you.

20:00.351 --> 20:02.636
When am I ever
going to use that again?

20:02.670 --> 20:05.972
Curse you, and this
morbidly obese little half-wit.

20:07.174 --> 20:10.360
So, they only want
to see a good guy

20:10.394 --> 20:12.195
fight a bad guy, eh?

20:13.848 --> 20:16.066
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa...

20:17.752 --> 20:19.703
He's taking on Mean Man Monty!

20:19.737 --> 20:21.538
Go get him, Honest Abe!

20:21.572 --> 20:23.840
This is why we go to
everything in this town--

20:23.874 --> 20:25.225
it always pays off.

20:28.195 --> 20:29.813
Honest Abe,
can I pin him?

20:29.847 --> 20:32.749
Ha-ha! You know it,
Laddie Liberty!

20:40.558 --> 20:43.226
Damndest boos
I ever heard.

20:43.261 --> 20:45.095
They're cheering, Grampa.

20:45.129 --> 20:48.265
This is what I've been
missing my whole life.

20:50.301 --> 20:52.769
Oh, that was so sweet.

20:53.871 --> 20:56.439
I wish Grampa was <i>my</i> dad.
