WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:08.642
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.742 --> 00:11.945
YOU REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I SAID YES TO HIM?

00:12.046 --> 00:15.549
IT'S BECAUSE YOU
SAID NO TO ME.

00:15.649 --> 00:18.719
PERHAPS I'M AN ALTERNATIVE
TO EVERYTHING THAT ANDREW
REPRESENTS--

00:18.819 --> 00:20.554
DEPENDENCY, ANXIETY.

00:20.654 --> 00:23.757
BUT I AM NOT A REALISTIC
OPTION FOR YOU, LAURA.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.959
JUST TELL ME.

00:26.060 --> 00:28.662
I THINK YOU OWE IT TO ME.

00:30.798 --> 00:32.700
DO YOU WANT ME?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.668
NO.

00:41.008 --> 00:43.811
( alarm ringing )

00:50.551 --> 00:52.086
( alarm stops )

01:15.909 --> 01:20.781
( footsteps thudding )

01:25.686 --> 01:27.755
( theme music playing )

02:13.401 --> 02:15.736
( knock on door )

02:21.942 --> 02:23.744
( panting )
I'M REALLY SORRY.

02:23.844 --> 02:25.546
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO ME.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.282
I ALMOST DIDN'T
MAKE IT HERE AT ALL.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.452
GOD!

02:31.552 --> 02:33.821
I'VE GOTTA
CALM DOWN FIRST.

02:33.921 --> 02:37.358
- CAN I GET SOME WATER,
PLEASE?
- SURE.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.600
WHAT, WERE YOU GOING TO
PUNISH ME FOR BEING LATE?

02:46.700 --> 02:48.469
OH, SORRY.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.004
I DON'T KNOW HOW
THAT GOT THERE.

02:51.104 --> 02:53.574
IT'S YOURS?

02:53.674 --> 02:56.143
YEAH.

02:56.244 --> 02:58.679
I THOUGHT SOMEONE
LEFT IT HERE.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.160
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

03:13.261 --> 03:15.429
WHY ARE YOU
25 MINUTES LATE?

03:15.529 --> 03:18.031
RIGHT.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.635
WELL, I TOOK A CAB HERE.
WE'RE FLYING DOWN
MADISON, RIGHT,

03:21.735 --> 03:24.605
AND ABOUT 200 FEET AWAY
FROM ME IS THIS DOG.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.174
SHE-- HE-- IT TRIES
TO CROSS THE STREET.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.344
YOU KNOW, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO CROSS THAT STRETCH
OF MADISON, IMPOSSIBLE.

03:30.444 --> 03:32.212
AND OF COURSE,
HE GETS RUN OVER.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.748
WELL, NOT RUN OVER--
HIT.

03:34.848 --> 03:37.485
THE CAR IN FRONT OF US
HIT HIM, SO HE RAN INTO
THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET.

03:37.585 --> 03:39.820
AND THEN ANOTHER CAR HIT HIM.
IT WAS AWFUL.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.790
( sobs )

03:42.890 --> 03:46.460
THE CARS WERE PLAYING
PING-PONG WITH HIM.
IT WAS LIKE PING, PING.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.696
HE DIDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.665
THE CAB I WAS IN ALMOST
HIT HIM, BUT THE DRIVER
STOPPED SHORT.

03:51.765 --> 03:54.702
BUT THEN THE CAR
ON THE LEFT HIT
HIM REALLY HARD.

03:54.802 --> 03:58.205
I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD,
BUT HE WASN'T.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.774
I LOOKED IN THE REAR WINDOW
AND I SAW HIM LIMPING
ACROSS THE STREET.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.143
I YELLED AT THE DRIVER
TO PLEASE STOP,
BUT HE COULDN'T

04:03.243 --> 04:06.314
BECAUSE THE TRAFFIC
THERE WOULD HAVE CAUSED
A MASSIVE PILEUP.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.416
BUT I COULDN'T NOT STOP,
YOU KNOW?

04:08.516 --> 04:10.684
I MEAN, IF THE DOG WAS ALIVE,
I HAD TO GET HIM TO A VET.

04:10.784 --> 04:15.122
I MEAN, DIDN'T I?
YOU WOULD'VE PULLED OVER.

04:15.222 --> 04:18.292
OR MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE GIVEN A DAMN.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.329
I DON'T THINK EVERYBODY
WOULD HAVE PULLED OVER.

04:21.429 --> 04:23.030
BUT YOU WOULD'VE
PULLED OVER, PAUL.

04:23.130 --> 04:27.134
I'M SURE YOU WOULD HAVE.
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
PULLED OVER?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.169
I WOULDN'T
HAVE PULLED OVER.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.405
NO?

04:31.505 --> 04:32.873
I WOULD'VE ASSUMED
THE DOG WAS DEAD

04:32.973 --> 04:35.376
AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING
I COULD REALLY DO FOR HIM.

04:35.476 --> 04:38.211
SURE, I'D BE SAD,
JUST LIKE YOU WERE,

04:38.312 --> 04:41.014
BUT I WOULDN'T
HAVE PULLED OVER.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.817
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.657
WELL, ANYWAY,
I COULDN'T NOT
STOP, OKAY?

04:49.757 --> 04:52.460
SO I YELLED AT THE DRIVER
TO MAKE A U-TURN

04:52.560 --> 04:54.227
SO I COULD GET
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE STREET,

04:54.328 --> 04:55.429
BUT SHIT,
THERE'S NO U-TURNS.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.164
AND THIS IDIOT CABBIE
IS TRYING

04:57.264 --> 04:59.633
TO PERSUADE ME THAT
WOUNDED ANIMALS PREFER
TO DIE ALONE

04:59.733 --> 05:01.835
JUST BECAUSE HE CAN'T
MAKE A FUCKING U-TURN.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.771
SO I YELLED AT HIM,
"PLEASE, CAN YOU STOP?

05:03.871 --> 05:05.806
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO. I NEED
TO DO SOMETHING."

05:05.906 --> 05:08.576
AND THEN I LOOKED
AT HIS DASHBOARD
AND IT'S FIVE TO,

05:08.676 --> 05:11.512
AND IT'S, YOU KNOW,
ANOTHER 25 MINUTES
TO YOUR OFFICE.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.482
IT WAS INCREDIBLY
FRUSTRATING.

05:14.582 --> 05:16.316
SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.719
IMAGINE, STOP FOR A DOG
THAT MAY DIE ANYWAY
AND BE VERY LATE.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.254
BUT YOU WOULD'VE
BEEN LATE ANYWAY.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.823
WHAT?

05:22.923 --> 05:25.292
WELL, YOU WERE STILL
VERY FAR AWAY

05:25.393 --> 05:27.395
AND IT WAS ALREADY FIVE TO.

05:27.495 --> 05:30.330
DOG OR NO DOG,
YOU'VE WOULD HAVE
BEEN 25 MINUTES LATE.

05:30.431 --> 05:34.402
THE FACT IS YOU'RE
NEVER LATE, LAURA.

05:34.502 --> 05:37.004
I WOULD HAVE
APPRECIATED A CALL.

05:40.408 --> 05:43.176
WHY ARE YOU LIKE THAT?

05:43.276 --> 05:45.278
LIKE WHAT?

05:45.379 --> 05:47.981
I DON'T KNOW--
ANTI.

05:48.081 --> 05:51.218
( scoffs )
ANTI?

05:51.318 --> 05:53.687
- ANTI WHAT?
- ANTI ME.

05:53.787 --> 05:56.223
I COME IN FEELING
LIKE SHIT FOR WHAT
I JUST WITNESSED

05:56.323 --> 05:58.659
AND YOU'RE GIVING ME
A REALLY NEGATIVE VIBE.

05:58.759 --> 06:00.961
I DON'T THINK I'M
BEING NEGATIVE, LAURA.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.831
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND YOU,
THAT'S ALL.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.833
I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

06:05.933 --> 06:08.702
THAT YOUR BEING LATE
TODAY WASN'T ENTIRELY
COINCIDENTAL.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.739
MAYBE YOU'RE TRYING
TO TELL ME SOMETHING.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.941
( chuckles )

06:14.041 --> 06:17.010
WHAT, I PAID THE DOG
TO GET RUN OVER IN FRONT
OF MY FACE?

06:17.110 --> 06:20.848
- I PLANTED HIM?
- NO, YOU WERE LATE
ALREADY, LAURA.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.186
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU WANT FROM ME, PAUL.

06:26.286 --> 06:29.723
YOU OPERATE ON
A VERY TIGHT SCHEDULE.
YOU'RE A BUSY WOMAN.

06:29.823 --> 06:32.059
YOU ALWAYS CALL IF THERE'S
GONNA BE A PROBLEM.

06:32.159 --> 06:35.162
IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY
AT THE HOSPITAL OR WHATEVER,
YOU ALWAYS CALL ME.

06:35.262 --> 06:36.764
YOU ARE NEVER LATE.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.800
IN FACT,
VERY OFTEN YOU'RE EARLY.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.702
AND SO?

06:41.802 --> 06:43.737
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOUR BEING LATE IS
TRYING TO SAY TO ME?

06:43.837 --> 06:46.907
NOTHING, PAUL.
I-- NOTHING.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.377
MAYBE--

06:50.478 --> 06:53.213
MAYBE YOU THINK THAT--

06:53.313 --> 06:55.816
THAT I'M NOT
DOING MY JOB.

06:55.916 --> 06:59.753
'CAUSE IF THAT'S THE CASE,
THEN WE SHOULD TALK
ABOUT THAT.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.189
ABOUT WHAT?

07:02.289 --> 07:04.124
LAURA, I KNOW...

07:04.224 --> 07:06.860
YOU WERE UPSET ABOUT

07:06.960 --> 07:09.563
- WITNESSING--
- LOOK AT YOU, PAUL.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.866
LISTEN TO YOU.
YOU'RE SCHEMING.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.836
I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE UP TO SOMETHING.

07:15.936 --> 07:18.438
WHAT AM I UP TO?

07:27.014 --> 07:28.749
IT SEEMS TO ME THAT
THE LAST FEW SESSIONS
THAT WE'VE HAD

07:28.849 --> 07:30.684
HAVE BEEN QUITE
DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.920
THE LAST FEW MONTHS,
PAUL.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.758
VERY
VERY DIFFICULT.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.195
AND WONDERFUL.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.300
ARE YOU ANGRY WITH ME?

07:47.400 --> 07:48.769
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,

07:48.869 --> 07:51.438
THEN THAT'S SOMETHING
WE REALLY NEED

07:51.539 --> 07:53.774
TO TALK ABOUT.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.177
MAYBE WE NEED
TO TALK ABOUT

07:57.277 --> 07:59.112
WHAT GOOD THIS THERAPY
IS DOING YOU

07:59.212 --> 08:02.449
OR NOT DOING.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.885
MAYBE YOU'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF IT.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.360
I WAS LATE
AND YOU'RE KICKING
ME OUT OF THERAPY?

08:13.460 --> 08:15.395
FUCKING HELL,
USE THE BELT.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.731
IT'S A MORE
HUMANE PUNISHMENT.

08:19.533 --> 08:23.303
LOOK, I'M NOT ANGRY.
I HAVE BEEN.

08:23.403 --> 08:25.505
I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT
NOT COMING HERE AT ALL

08:25.606 --> 08:28.742
JUST AS, LIKE,
A SMALL PROTEST.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.844
WHEN I LEFT HERE
LAST WEEK,

08:30.944 --> 08:32.746
I PHONED FOR A CAB
AND THE LINE WAS BUSY.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.648
I WAS JUST WALKING AROUND
IN CIRCLES,

08:34.748 --> 08:36.850
ROUND AND ROUND--
AROUND THE BLOCK,
AROUND THE GARDEN.

08:36.950 --> 08:39.787
THEN I REALIZED
I WAS IN SHOCK, PAUL.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.690
I FELT LIKE SOMEONE
HAD PUNCHED ME.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.125
THAT'S HOW YOU FELT?

08:46.794 --> 08:49.329
LIKE I'D PUNCHED YOU?

08:49.429 --> 08:52.132
DO I NEED TO REMIND
YOU WHAT YOU SAID
TO ME RIGHT HERE

08:52.232 --> 08:56.604
AT THE DOOR AT THE END
OF THE LAST SESSION?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.644
YOU KNOW, I HAVE
A FEELING THAT IF I
HADN'T MENTIONED IT,

09:03.744 --> 09:06.046
YOU NEVER WOULD
HAVE BROUGHT IT UP.

09:06.146 --> 09:08.115
YOU WOULD HAVE HIDDEN
BEHIND THAT IDIOTIC RULE

09:08.215 --> 09:11.184
ABOUT THERAPISTS
NOT INITIATING TOPICS
OF CONVERSATION.

09:11.284 --> 09:14.722
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO LET
THE PATIENT LEAD, RIGHT?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.926
YOU WOULD'VE TAKEN
ADVANTAGE OF THAT RULE

09:19.026 --> 09:21.862
SO WE'D NEVER TALK
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AGAIN
AS IF IT DIDN'T EXIST.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.568
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO TALK ABOUT TODAY?

09:28.669 --> 09:32.472
YOU ACT AS IF YOU
DON'T KNOW ME, PAUL.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.407
THAT'S WHAT PISSES
ME OFF THE MOST.

09:34.507 --> 09:36.877
YOU LOOK AT ME AS IF,
"REMIND ME AGAIN WHAT
YOUR NAME IS."

09:36.977 --> 09:39.747
ON THE CONTRARY.
I THINK I'M COMING
FROM SOMEWHERE

09:39.847 --> 09:41.514
THAT I THINK
YOU KNOW VERY WELL.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.717
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I'M
DWELLING ON THIS POINT--

09:43.817 --> 09:46.353
- WHAT POINT?
- YOUR ANGER.

09:46.453 --> 09:48.822
MY ANGER OVER--

09:50.157 --> 09:52.125
YOU'RE TRYING
TO MAKE ME ANGRY.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.662
YOU'RE PROVOKING ME.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.897
NO, I'M SUGGESTING THAT
YOU ALREADY WERE ANGRY

09:56.997 --> 09:58.866
BEFORE YOU CAME IN THE DOOR.

09:58.966 --> 10:01.534
YOU WERE SO ANGRY THAT
YOU WERE CONSIDERING
NOT COMING HERE AT ALL.

10:01.635 --> 10:04.337
AND YOU EXPRESSED THAT
ANGER BY COMING LATE.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.173
FUCK!
I CAN'T WIN HERE.
YOU'RE--

10:06.273 --> 10:08.141
- I'M WHAT?
- I WAS GONNA TELL YOU
WHAT CONCLUSIONS

10:08.241 --> 10:10.644
I'VE REACHED THIS WEEK,
BUT YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED,
ARE YOU?

10:10.744 --> 10:13.046
YOU'D PREFER TO BAIT ME,
TO PISS ME OFF TO PROVE--

10:13.146 --> 10:15.749
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT THE TRUTH IS?
I'M THE OPPOSITE OF ANGRY.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.152
- ANTI-ANGRY.
- FUCK YOU, PAUL!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.226
WHEN YOU SAID YOU
DIDN'T WANT ME,

10:26.326 --> 10:29.096
MY FIRST INSTINCT WAS
TO TELL YOU, "WHO CARES?
I DON'T WANT THIS.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.631
I WON'T COME."

10:31.732 --> 10:35.635
BUT THEN I REALIZED
THAT IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
IT'S MY FAULT.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.504
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.773
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
LOVE ME IN RETURN.

10:42.142 --> 10:45.545
LAURA, I REALIZE
THAT I MAY HAVE

10:45.645 --> 10:48.749
SLAMMED THE DOOR
TOO LOUDLY IN YOUR FACE.

10:50.650 --> 10:53.486
- MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE--
- CRUEL?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.155
NO, I DON'T THINK
I WAS CRUEL.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.924
I WAS RESOLVED.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.325
OH.

10:58.425 --> 11:01.294
SEE, YOU DEMANDED
AN UNEQUIVOCAL ANSWER
AND I GAVE YOU ONE.

11:01.394 --> 11:04.998
I DON'T APOLOGIZE
FOR GIVING YOU THAT ANSWER.

11:10.470 --> 11:12.439
I AM SORRY
THAT I HURT YOU.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.315
OKAY.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.786
SO A:
I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY.

11:28.621 --> 11:32.259
AND B: I THINK
YOUR ANSWER LAST TIME
WASN'T SO UNEQUIVOCAL.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.995
AND C: I THINK
MY EXCUSE FOR COMING
LATE WAS PERFECT.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.131
THE EXCUSE MAY HAVE BEEN
PERFECT, BUT THE TIMING
WASN'T COINCIDENTAL.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.234
( laughs )

11:41.334 --> 11:44.371
NOW I SEE WHY
THEY LAUGH AT SHRINKS
AND ALL THEIR BULLSHIT.

11:44.471 --> 11:46.673
WHAT DID YOU REALLY MEAN?
WHAT DOES THAT REALLY MEAN?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.842
- IT'S BULLSHIT.
- ANNOYING BULLSHIT.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.078
WOULDN'T IT ANNOY YOU
IF YOUR THERAPIST
FORCED YOU

11:51.178 --> 11:53.313
TO ACCEPT SOME
RIDICULOUS INTERPRETATION

11:53.413 --> 11:55.916
AND YOU COULDN'T DEFEND
YOURSELF AGAINST IT BECAUSE
YOU'RE THE PATIENT?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.885
EVERYTHING YOU SAY
WOULD BE HELD
AGAINST YOU.

11:57.985 --> 11:59.953
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SHOULD'VE STAYED
WITH THAT DOG.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.856
I SHOULD TAKEN THE DOG
TO THE VET INSTEAD
OF COMING HERE.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.093
HERE WHERE YOU'RE
NOT BEING ADEQUATELY
TREATED MAYBE?

12:06.193 --> 12:08.328
WHAT DO YOU WANT
FROM ME, PAUL?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.730
YOU REFUSE TO LISTEN
TO ME.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.700
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE
LISTENING TO YOURSELF.

12:13.801 --> 12:16.904
MAYBE YOU'RE IDENTIFYING
WITH THE DOG.

12:17.004 --> 12:19.039
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT DOG DESERVES MORE
THAN BEING CO-OPTED

12:19.139 --> 12:22.142
AS SOME IDIOTIC
INTERPRETATION.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.377
YOU WANT TO EXPLORE
SOME COCKAMAMIE THEORY?

12:24.477 --> 12:26.579
WELL, THEN AT LEAST
MAKE UP SOMETHING ORIGINAL.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.181
I MEAN, JESUS,
MAKE AN EFFORT.

12:28.281 --> 12:31.251
YOU THINK I DON'T
MAKE AN EFFORT?

12:31.351 --> 12:34.587
DO YOU THINK I DON'T TRY
HARD ENOUGH IN THERAPY?
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

12:34.687 --> 12:38.091
THAT I SIT HERE LIKE
A PARASITE WHO FEEDS
OFF YOUR STORIES

12:38.191 --> 12:41.061
AND YOUR REALITY
AND YOUR PAIN?

12:41.161 --> 12:44.331
MAYBE I'M NOT
HELPING YOU AT ALL.

12:48.535 --> 12:50.871
WOW.

12:53.673 --> 12:56.076
ALL OF A SUDDEN
I MISS ANDREW.

12:56.176 --> 13:00.180
FOR THE FIRST TIME I'M
SITTING HERE FACING YOU,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.315
AND I MISS HIM.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.821
IT'S SO STRANGE
TO MISS ANDREW.

13:09.656 --> 13:12.826
ANDREW WHO LOVES ME,

13:12.926 --> 13:14.995
WHO ADMITS IT,
WHO SHOUTS IT OUT
IN PUBLIC.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.197
WHAT IF I DID THAT?

13:17.297 --> 13:19.833
HAVE YOU EVER
IMAGINED THAT?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.634
NO NO NO, PAUL.

13:21.734 --> 13:24.471
HUH-UH.
I'VE STOPPED FANTASIZING.

13:24.571 --> 13:28.441
I'VE KICKED THE HABIT.
IT'S HAZARDOUS TO MY HEALTH.

13:36.083 --> 13:37.985
I'M GETTING MARRIED
IN A FEW MONTHS.

13:38.085 --> 13:40.787
I NEED TO CONSERVE EVERY
LAST DROP OF ENERGY

13:40.888 --> 13:42.856
FOR MY WEDDING.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.860
YOU'RE FINDING IT REQUIRES
ENERGY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE?

13:46.960 --> 13:49.162
I THOUGHT BRIDES
WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

13:49.262 --> 13:52.132
WHIRLING DERVISHES
OF ACTIVITY.

13:58.305 --> 13:59.873
OH MY GOD.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.910
JUST THE WORD "BRIDE"
CREEPS ME OUT.

14:04.611 --> 14:08.215
I TOLD ANDREW TO PICK
A CATERER AND LOCATION
WITHOUT ME.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.483
- REALLY?
- YEAH, WELL,

14:10.583 --> 14:12.819
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE IF YOU GET MARRIED
AT THE HILTON OR THE HYATT?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.321
IT'S ALL THE SAME.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.289
NO MATTER HOW HARD
YOU TRY TO BE DIFFERENT,

14:16.389 --> 14:19.192
YOU ALWAYS END UP LOOKING
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE,
EVEN WORSE.

14:25.365 --> 14:28.301
GOD, I WISH I COULD
JUST GET MARRIED IN VEGAS.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.838
NO CATERERS, NO GUESTS,
JUST AN ALCOHOLIC
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

14:31.939 --> 14:33.840
AND A TRANSVESTITE
ORGAN PLAYER.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.576
( laughs )

14:39.612 --> 14:41.348
YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID--
ANDREW?

14:41.448 --> 14:44.617
HE SENT AN E-MAIL
TO EVERYONE IN HIS
ADDRESS BOOK.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.119
I MEAN EVERYONE--

14:46.219 --> 14:48.521
HIS INSURANCE AGENT,
HIS MECHANIC.

14:48.621 --> 14:51.124
WE HAD AN EXTERMINATOR OVER
A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO,

14:51.224 --> 14:52.960
EVEN HE GOT AN E-MAIL.

14:53.060 --> 14:56.429
HE'S TOLD EVERYBODY.
I HAVEN'T EVEN
TOLD MY FATHER.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.265
REALLY?

14:58.365 --> 15:01.001
WELL,
I HAVEN'T HAD TIME.

15:01.101 --> 15:03.036
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

15:03.136 --> 15:04.837
I'VE BEEN BUSY.

15:04.938 --> 15:07.240
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL
HIM OVER THE PHONE.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.243
ANDREW SUGGESTED THAT
WE BOTH GO IN THERE
AND TELL HIM TOGETHER,

15:10.343 --> 15:13.513
BUT, I DON'T KNOW,
SOMETHING HAPPENED.
WE DIDN'T GET AROUND TO IT.

15:13.613 --> 15:16.083
BESIDES, I DIDN'T WANT
US BOTH TO GO IN THERE.

15:16.183 --> 15:19.619
YOU KNOW, HAND IN HAND
ALL LOVEY-DOVEY
LIKE THE MOVIES--

15:19.719 --> 15:21.854
"GUESS WHAT, DADDY!"

15:21.955 --> 15:24.857
SO IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THAT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

15:24.958 --> 15:29.129
YOU'VE JUST AVOIDED
TELLING HIM.

15:36.069 --> 15:38.738
HE HASN'T BEEN
FEELING WELL LATELY.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.408
HE'S HAD
ALL THESE TESTS DONE.

15:41.508 --> 15:42.709
OF COURSE,
I TAKE HIM.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.877
HE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT QUESTIONS TO ASK.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.780
HE THINKS BECAUSE I'M
A DOCTOR THEY'LL BE MORE
STRAIGHT UP WITH ME.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.051
TO BE HONEST,
IT WOULD BE MUCH NICER
TO BE IN THE DARK,

15:51.151 --> 15:52.752
NOT KNOW THE TRUTH.

15:52.852 --> 15:54.754
I COULD BE POSITIVE,

15:54.854 --> 15:57.024
ENCOURAGING, OPTIMISTIC.

15:57.124 --> 15:59.659
HE HAS AN MRI TODAY.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.330
MAYBE THE NEWS OF YOU
AND ANDREW WOULD COME

16:03.430 --> 16:05.298
AS A WELCOME DISTRACTION
TO HIM.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.368
IT'D MAKE HIM HAPPY,
YEAH?

16:11.371 --> 16:13.940
YES.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.942
WELL, THAT'S A PROBLEM.

16:16.043 --> 16:18.711
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

16:21.848 --> 16:25.352
WELL, IT'LL GIVE HIM
SOMETHING TO LOOK
FORWARD TO.

16:26.586 --> 16:29.122
YOU MEAN IF YOU TELL HIM,
IT'LL BE REAL?

16:37.164 --> 16:39.499
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.770
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.840
I KNOW ANDREW'S BEEN
SO HAPPY THESE DAYS,

16:47.940 --> 16:50.310
I FEEL LIKE I'M
CHEATING HIM.

16:50.410 --> 16:54.047
- HOW?
- JUST BY BEING SAD.

16:54.147 --> 16:57.717
WELL, NOT SAD EXACTLY,
BUT NOT HAPPY EITHER--

16:57.817 --> 17:00.587
NEUTRAL, INDIFFERENT.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.156
IT'S LIKE ANDREW MADE US
DO THE ROUNDS LAST WEEK

17:03.256 --> 17:05.092
AND SEE ALL OUR FRIENDS
AND TELL THEM THE GOOD NEWS.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.828
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE...

17:08.928 --> 17:11.331
DID YOU EVER SEE THE MOVIE
"KING KONG"?

17:11.431 --> 17:12.499
YES.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.801
YOU KNOW HOW
THEY CAPTURE HIM
FROM THE WILD

17:14.901 --> 17:16.803
AND THEY BRING HIM BACK
TO CIVILIZATION

17:16.903 --> 17:19.172
AND THEY PUT HIM ON DISPLAY
FOR THE WHOLE WORLD TO SEE?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.241
BUT HE WASN'T
INDIFFERENT.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.743
HE WAS ANGRY,
IF I REMEMBER.

17:23.843 --> 17:26.146
WHATEVER. IT'S A FREAK SHOW.
I FEEL LIKE A FREAK SHOW.

17:26.246 --> 17:29.082
EVERYONE'S LOOKING AT ME
WITH THESE FAKE SMILES

17:29.182 --> 17:31.951
PLASTERED ALL OVER
THEIR FACE.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.787
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE ALL WAITING
TO SEE WHAT I DO NEXT.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.492
LAURA, WE DON'T
REALLY HAVE--

17:39.592 --> 17:41.294
WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
THAT MUCH TIME LEFT.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.895
COME ON,
I JUST GOT HERE.

17:42.995 --> 17:44.864
YOU WERE HALF AN HOUR LATE.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.334
WE'RE BACK
TO THAT AGAIN,

17:47.434 --> 17:49.001
THAT BULLSHIT
ABOUT ME BEING LATE.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.804
I KNOW YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S IMPORTANT. I DO.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.240
I GIVE UP, PAUL.
IT'S POINTLESS.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.275
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST
BIND AND GAG ME,

17:55.375 --> 17:57.944
BECAUSE WHATEVER I
SAY OR DO DOESN'T MAKE
A DIFFERENCE ANYWAY.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.113
MAYBE THAT'S WHAT
YOU'D REALLY LIKE
TO DO-- SHUT ME UP.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.915
YEAH, I WOULD,
'CAUSE YOU KEEP SAYING
THE SAME THING.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.418
I HEAR YOU, PAUL.
YOU WANT TO KICK ME
OUT OF THERAPY.

18:05.518 --> 18:07.754
- I GET IT.
- NO, I DON'T WANT
TO KICK YOU OUT.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.557
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

18:12.892 --> 18:16.329
I DO THINK WE SHOULD
ALLOW THE POSSIBILITY
INTO THE ROOM.

18:16.429 --> 18:20.400
THE POSSIBILITY
OF US WINDING DOWN
OUR THERAPY.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.735
OH, BELIEVE ME,
YOU LET IT IN.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.208
HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THIS?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.243
HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
ABOUT GETTING RID OF ME

18:30.343 --> 18:32.579
FOR A LONG TIME?

18:32.679 --> 18:34.614
TO BE HONEST, IT LOOKS
TO ME LIKE YOU'VE BEEN

18:34.714 --> 18:36.883
WAITING FOR THIS TO HAPPEN,
HOPING THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

18:36.983 --> 18:39.719
MY BEING LATE TODAY
IS THE PERFECT EXCUSE
TO GET RID OF ME.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.322
FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT GETTING RID
OF YOU, LAURA.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.558
I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO CONSIDER

18:45.658 --> 18:48.195
WHETHER THIS THERAPY
IS REALLY HELPING.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.263
OH, SO NOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO SOFTEN THE BLOW.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.598
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
DON'T BOTHER.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.701
SECONDLY, I THINK
THAT YOU TOSSED ME OUT

18:54.801 --> 18:56.569
A LONG TIME AGO.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.206
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO TREAT YOU AS
A PSYCHOLOGIST.

18:59.306 --> 19:03.109
YOU WANT ME TO TREAT YOU
AS SOMEBODY

19:03.210 --> 19:04.844
WHO'S IN LOVE WITH YOU.

19:04.944 --> 19:08.415
AND IN MY OPINION,
THAT IS RUINING ANY CHANCE

19:08.515 --> 19:11.484
OF THIS THERAPY BEING
TRULY PRODUCTIVE.

19:11.584 --> 19:15.087
LET'S FACE IT,
I HAVE NOT BEEN
YOUR THERAPIST

19:15.188 --> 19:18.358
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,
LAURA.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.293
I'M THE ONE
WHO SAYS NO TO YOU.

19:20.393 --> 19:22.429
I'M THE ONE
WHO HUMILIATES YOU.

19:22.529 --> 19:24.864
I'VE BEEN HUMILIATING YOU
FOR THE LAST YEAR

19:24.964 --> 19:27.467
BY NOT RESPONDING
TO YOU.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.003
MY HONEST OPINION IS THAT
IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT

19:31.103 --> 19:33.039
TO CONTINUE THERAPY
THIS WAY,

19:33.139 --> 19:35.275
FROM SUCH AN EMOTIONALLY
CHARGED PLACE.

19:35.375 --> 19:37.377
THERAPY SHOULD
NOT BE A SOURCE

19:37.477 --> 19:40.913
OF CONSTANT HUMILIATION
FOR YOU.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.416
YOU REALLY DESERVE MORE.

19:48.388 --> 19:51.391
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT A GOOD
ENOUGH THERAPIST ALL
OF A SUDDEN?

19:52.825 --> 19:56.296
AM I THE FIRST PATIENT
TO BE IN LOVE WITH YOU, PAUL?

19:57.430 --> 19:59.499
YOU'VE BEEN A THERAPIST
FOR 20 YEARS.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.269
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO KNOW WHAT TO DO
IN THESE CASES?

20:02.369 --> 20:05.738
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,
JUST DEAL WITH IT.

20:09.942 --> 20:13.179
MAYBE YOU CAN'T TREAT ME
BECAUSE YOU'RE IN
LOVE WITH ME TOO.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.915
I CAN'T TREAT YOU,
LAURA,

20:16.015 --> 20:19.586
BECAUSE THE BOUNDARIES
HAVE BEEN BREACHED
TOO OFTEN.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.654
YOU'VE BREACHED THEM
BY TELLING ME

20:21.754 --> 20:24.324
THAT YOU NO LONGER WANT
TO BE MY PATIENT.

20:24.424 --> 20:26.793
SO FUCKING WHAT?

20:33.866 --> 20:35.368
WHAT, OUR TIME IS UP?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.905
YES, I'M AFRAID IT IS.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.508
COULDN'T YOU GIVE ME
EXTRA TIME?

20:41.608 --> 20:45.812
THERE WAS THIS LITTLE DOG,
REMEMBER?

20:47.480 --> 20:49.749
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T,
LAURA.

20:49.849 --> 20:51.183
COME ON, 10 MINUTES.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.786
I HAVE TO BE
SOMEWHERE ELSE.
I'M SORRY.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.562
IT'S--

21:02.662 --> 21:05.298
IT'S THE END
OF THE MONTH.

21:05.398 --> 21:08.568
I PRESUME
YOU WILL NEED...

21:08.668 --> 21:10.236
A RECEIPT.

21:10.337 --> 21:14.206
I'VE DONE OUT AN INVOICE.

21:14.307 --> 21:16.776
I'VE BILLED YOU FOR THE--

21:39.866 --> 21:43.536
- YOU NEED SOME HELP?
- YEAH, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.107
- THANKS.
- YOU HERE TO SEE PAUL?

21:48.207 --> 21:51.478
- YEAH.
- YOU'RE A PATIENT OF HIS?

21:51.578 --> 21:53.846
- YOU?
- YEAH.

21:53.946 --> 21:57.850
- WHAT'S THAT?
- OH, JUST SOMETHING
I BROUGHT HIM.

21:57.950 --> 21:59.819
WHAT, A GIFT?

21:59.919 --> 22:02.455
WOW. WHAT, DID HE
SOLVE SOMETHING HUGE
FOR YOU?

22:02.555 --> 22:04.657
- MAJOR CRISIS?
- NO, NOT YET.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.826
I'VE JUST BEEN COMING TO HIM
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.095
IT'S FUNNY I'VE NEVER
RUN INTO YOU BEFORE.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.964
IS THIS YOUR USUAL TIME?

22:12.064 --> 22:15.034
YEAH, EVERY TUESDAY.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.937
IT'S MONDAY.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.105
WHAT?

22:19.205 --> 22:21.107
IT'S MONDAY.

22:21.207 --> 22:23.109
- NO.
- YEAH.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.678
IT'S NOT--

22:27.213 --> 22:29.949
OH, SHIT.

22:33.520 --> 22:36.222
- IT'S MONDAY.
- IT'S MONDAY.

22:36.322 --> 22:38.691
FUCK!

22:41.260 --> 22:43.162
YOU KNOW,
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT

22:43.262 --> 22:45.398
AND SOMEHOW I GOT--

22:45.498 --> 22:47.333
GOT THE TIMES--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

22:47.434 --> 22:49.101
I'M GONNA COME BACK TOMORROW

22:49.201 --> 22:51.137
AND BRING IT TOMORROW.

22:55.742 --> 22:58.044
TOO BAD YOUR GOOD
SAMARITAN EFFORTS
WERE WASTED.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.979
IT'S OKAY.

23:06.519 --> 23:09.221
DO YOU KNOW OF A VET,
BY ANY CHANCE?

23:09.321 --> 23:12.459
A VET? REALLY?

23:12.559 --> 23:15.361
NO, I'VE GOT A FRIEND
WHO'S GOT A DOG.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.431
I CAN ASK HIM
IF YOU WANT.

23:20.533 --> 23:23.035
WHERE YOU HEADED?

23:26.338 --> 23:29.141
DOWNTOWN.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.143
YOU NEED A RIDE?

23:31.243 --> 23:33.546
WELL, I WAS GONNA
GET A CAB.

23:33.646 --> 23:37.617
CAB? H OW WOULD YOU LOOK
IN A CAB WHEN YOU COULD
BE ROLLING WITH THIS?

23:41.153 --> 23:42.822
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

23:42.922 --> 23:45.291
LAURA.

23:45.391 --> 23:47.760
ALEX.
LET'S DO IT.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.735
( theme music playing )
