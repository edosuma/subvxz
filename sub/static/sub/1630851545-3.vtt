<i>[narrator] Alaska,
a vast, remote wilderness</i>

00:04.071 --> 00:06.005

00:06.007 --> 00:09.742
You could walk for a year

[narrator]
<i>In the last 30 years,</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:50.582
In the vastness of this country,

00:56.624 --> 00:58.057

02:12.967 --> 02:16.135
<i>They want to keep the humans
out of their territory.</i>

02:16.137 --> 02:18.370
So, it could be dangerous.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.573
<i>[narrator] Huge trees

<i>Investigators unearth perhaps
the most compelling evidence yet</i>

02:28.015 --> 02:30.449
<i>of a colony of Bigfoot.</i>

02:30.451 --> 02:35.554
This, to me, is the Holy Grail
of Bigfoot researching.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.421
This is proof.

02:36.423 --> 02:38.123
It's an upside-down tree.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.926
[typing machine]

02:40.928 --> 02:43.595
[suspense music]

02:43.597 --> 02:46.031
[narrator] <i>Prince of
Wales Island, in Alaska.</i>

<i>With over 2,500 square miles

<i>But, with a population
of just 6,000,</i>

03:01.348 --> 03:04.850
<i>it's one of the most remote

03:04.852 --> 03:06.885
<i>An ideal hiding place</i>

03:06.887 --> 03:09.555

[creature growls]</i>

03:13.726 --> 03:16.128
[Bill] Everywhere
we're looking right here,

03:16.130 --> 03:18.397
there's no one out there
right now.

03:21.301 --> 03:23.802
It's very, very remote.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.771
I think that's one
of the reasons

03:25.773 --> 03:27.706
it's such a good place
for the...

03:27.708 --> 03:29.975
something like Bigfoot to live.

03:33.246 --> 03:35.881
<i>[narrator] Local trapper
and hunter Bill Musser</i>

03:35.883 --> 03:38.584
<i>has lived in the island

03:40.086 --> 03:42.955
<i>Like many islanders,
he has a story to tell</i>

03:42.957 --> 03:44.990
<i>about a brush with the Bigfoot,</i>

03:44.992 --> 03:46.425
<i>who are said to roam here.</i>

03:47.994 --> 03:49.728
<i>His encounter came recently,</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:51.964
<i>when he was out hunting
with his cousin.</i>

03:53.766 --> 03:56.935
[Bill] You know, we packed in,
uh... a small motor,

03:56.937 --> 03:58.704
and tooled
around the lake a little bit

03:58.706 --> 03:59.871
and explored.

04:01.507 --> 04:03.675
<i>[narrator] They decided
to build a trapper's cabin</i>

04:03.677 --> 04:05.744
<i>to use as their base.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:10.449
<i>But, soon, they realized they
weren't alone in the woods.</i>

04:10.451 --> 04:14.219
We start hearing some,
uh, banging on a tree

04:14.221 --> 04:15.554
across the way.

04:15.556 --> 04:19.091
[loud banging]

04:19.093 --> 04:22.160
<i>[narrator] Knowing they were
the only humans in these woods,</i>

04:22.162 --> 04:24.229
<i>Bill and his cousin
were unnerved</i>

04:24.231 --> 04:26.365
<i>by this bizarre sound.</i>

04:27.133 --> 04:28.867
[Bill] We would pound
a little bit

04:28.869 --> 04:30.702
and it would pound back at us.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.338
[loud banging]

04:33.340 --> 04:37.309
Three, maybe four good whacks
at a time.

04:37.311 --> 04:41.179
[suspense music]

04:41.181 --> 04:44.316
[loud banging]

04:44.318 --> 04:47.386
<i>I don't know any animal
that can do anything like that.</i>

04:47.388 --> 04:48.787
<i>There was something
in the woods,</i>

04:48.789 --> 04:51.790
whacking the trees.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.794
<i>[narrator] After hearing
similar reports of Bigfoot nearby,</i>

04:55.796 --> 04:58.363
<i>Bill came
to one sinister conclusion.</i>

04:59.799 --> 05:01.900
[Bill] I believe
that was a Bigfoot,

05:01.902 --> 05:03.402
especially
with all the other sightings

05:03.404 --> 05:04.903
that have happened
on the island.

05:04.905 --> 05:08.607
[suspense music]

05:08.609 --> 05:11.276
[narrator] <i>Sasquatch
researcher Cliff Barackman</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:13.612
<i>believes this tree pounding
by Bigfoot</i>

05:13.614 --> 05:18.116
<i>is a tell-tale sign of the
creature marking its territory.</i>

05:18.118 --> 05:21.853
It's been noted as far back
as the late 1950s

05:21.855 --> 05:24.856
that Bigfoot
tends to bang on logs

05:24.858 --> 05:26.124
or do something like that.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.826
We call it tree-knocking.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.995
[loud banging]

05:29.997 --> 05:33.065
It's very often deployed
to let the other Sasquatches

05:33.067 --> 05:35.334
in the area know
that something has changed.

05:35.336 --> 05:38.036
<i>Like, maybe somebody
has come into an area.</i>

05:38.038 --> 05:42.374
A similar behavior has been
well documented in gorillas.

05:44.043 --> 05:46.812
<i>They clap their hands
to warn the other gorillas</i>

05:46.814 --> 05:49.181
<i>that, "Hey, a shooter's
around the area," you know?</i>

05:49.183 --> 05:52.250
I think Sasquatches
use this form of communication

05:52.252 --> 05:53.752
for something similar.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.887
But, sometimes,
those tree-knocks

05:55.889 --> 05:59.024
can be very threatening
to the humans.

06:00.093 --> 06:02.060
<i>[narrator] It seems
that those who haven't heeded</i>

06:02.062 --> 06:03.462
<i>these warning signs</i>

06:03.464 --> 06:06.131
<i>have often faced consequences.</i>

06:06.933 --> 06:10.135
[loud banging]

06:10.137 --> 06:12.337
<i>[Cliff] There have been
a small number of cases</i>

06:12.339 --> 06:13.772
<i>when people have been
out in the woods</i>

06:13.774 --> 06:15.173
hunting or foraging

06:15.175 --> 06:17.008
and, then, they hear
these knocking noises.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.545
[loud banging]

06:22.048 --> 06:24.383
<i>[narrator] Some have dared

06:30.891 --> 06:32.023

<i>[Cliff] And, when they went
to investigate,</i>

06:33.961 --> 06:36.094
<i>they observed a Sasquatch.</i>

06:36.096 --> 06:40.298
[loud banging]

06:40.300 --> 06:43.068
<i>There's one message

Get the hell out.

06:44.037 --> 06:48.106
[creature growls]

06:49.742 --> 06:52.277
[narrator] <i>This could be a
warning from the Bigfoot here</i>

06:52.279 --> 06:55.347
<i>that they will now seize
control of this island.</i>

06:59.820 --> 07:02.053
<i>the tales

07:07.527 --> 07:10.262
<i>But, for islanders
like Paul Washington Sr.,</i>

07:10.264 --> 07:14.032
<i>these incidents seem to have
become frighteningly more common.</i>

<i>Paul tells of one encounter while

[creature roaring]

07:54.241 --> 07:58.076
[Paul] Right in front of me

07:58.078 --> 07:59.811
I just froze.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.147
[creature growling]

08:04.217 --> 08:06.618
[narrator]
<i>Paul radioed for help.</i>

08:06.620 --> 08:08.854
<i>Then, set off
towards his colleague,</i>

08:08.856 --> 08:12.090
<i>who was alone and unaware
of their predicament.</i>

08:12.092 --> 08:14.192
I put my eyes down on the road,

08:14.194 --> 08:16.394
and I start walking toward her.

08:18.965 --> 08:21.333
<i>[narrator] She too heard
a rustle in the trees.</i>

08:26.138 --> 08:29.574
[woman screams]

08:30.142 --> 08:32.377
[Paul] All of a sudden,
there was a big scream

08:32.379 --> 08:36.414
on the radio that said there was
a Sasquatch right in front of her.

08:37.016 --> 08:40.452
[creature growling]

08:41.921 --> 08:43.889

08:46.126 --> 08:48.927
[creature growling]

08:59.239 --> 09:03.108
[narrator] <i>Next, Paul says
backup raced to the scene.</i>

09:07.246 --> 09:09.614
<i>But the pair of Bigfoot
had vanished</i>

09:10.683 --> 09:12.484
<i>as quickly as they'd appeared.</i>

09:14.887 --> 09:18.490
<i>For now, it seemed Paul

09:21.127 --> 09:24.162
<i>Though, after his run-in
with two of these creatures,</i>

09:24.164 --> 09:27.265
<i>Paul is now wary
whenever he's out hunting.</i>

09:29.902 --> 09:31.803
I always look behind my back,

From the evidence

do some investigation,

11:30.157 --> 11:32.924
[creature growling]

11:32.926 --> 11:34.459
<i>and driven
into the ground.</i>

11:34.461 --> 11:36.561
[creature growling]

11:37.930 --> 11:41.166
<i>It's only something a
powerful Bigfoot could achieve.</i>

11:41.168 --> 11:43.635
[creature growling]

11:43.637 --> 11:46.337
<i>And Chuke's on a mission
to find them.</i>

11:46.339 --> 11:50.608
<i>This may even lead to the
island's Sasquatch community itself.</i>

11:52.078 --> 11:55.246
[Chuke] It's a place I've
wanted to travel to for years.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.749
For me, it's kind of like the...

11:57.751 --> 12:01.953
Holy Grail of a Bigfoot
hunter or investigator,

12:01.955 --> 12:04.289
because these Bigfoot
are ripping out trees,

12:04.291 --> 12:06.057
turning them upside down,

12:06.059 --> 12:07.959
and shoving them
deep in the ground

12:07.961 --> 12:10.128
as a show of their strength.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.130
To show what they can do
and to warn people

12:12.132 --> 12:13.865
to stay out of their territory.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.467
[creature growling]

12:15.469 --> 12:17.602
It's frightening to see because,

12:17.604 --> 12:19.838
I mean, it looks like
a Hollywood horror movie.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.607
[creature growling]

12:24.110 --> 12:26.211
<i>[narrator] Cryptozoologist
Lance Hightower</i>

12:26.213 --> 12:28.313
<i>has been studying
this phenomenon,</i>

12:28.315 --> 12:31.449
<i>which he also believes
points to Bigfoot.</i>

12:32.852 --> 12:35.620
[Lance] The trees
are hundreds of pounds.

12:35.622 --> 12:38.957
It would require a human being
having heavy machinery

12:38.959 --> 12:41.092
in order to rip it
out of the ground,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.795
with roots extending
several feet down,

12:43.797 --> 12:45.830
then turning it upside down,

12:45.832 --> 12:48.500
and jamming it
in the soil several feet.

12:48.502 --> 12:51.236
Again, hundreds of pounds
of the tree

12:51.238 --> 12:53.071
going that far into the ground?

12:53.073 --> 12:54.606
No human could do that.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.341
It had to be a Bigfoot.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.912
<i>[narrator] To trace
these fabled trees</i>

13:00.914 --> 13:04.382
<i>and find out more about the
island's Bigfoot population.</i>

13:04.384 --> 13:06.217
<i>First, Chuke's journey takes him</i>

13:06.219 --> 13:09.521
<i>to the native
Tlingit community in Klawock.</i>

13:09.523 --> 13:12.223
<i>Here, he meets Elder Al Jackson,</i>

13:12.225 --> 13:16.294
<i>who's seen groups of
Sasquatch with his very own eyes.</i>

13:18.030 --> 13:19.264
There's two.

13:19.266 --> 13:22.767
A... A male and female that...

13:22.769 --> 13:24.969
they're along the Klawock river.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.806
The male's about 10 feet tall!

13:27.808 --> 13:29.007
[Chuke] Wow.

13:29.009 --> 13:33.812
You know, the male has a roar.
I mean, loud.

13:33.814 --> 13:34.913
It is...

13:34.915 --> 13:36.047
- [Chuke] Okay.
- It's real loud.

13:36.049 --> 13:39.617
Make the lion sound
like a pussycat.

13:39.619 --> 13:42.353
- [Chuke] Maybe we'll see something, I'm hoping.
- [Al] Yeah.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.592
[narrator] <i>Chuke decides to
head towards Klawock Mountain,</i>

13:47.594 --> 13:50.495
<i>which is central to the
various Bigfoot sightings.</i>

13:51.263 --> 13:54.365
<i>The upside-down trees
are said to lie here,</i>

13:54.367 --> 13:56.568
<i>and it's believed
this marks the start</i>

13:56.570 --> 13:58.469
<i>of Bigfoot territory.</i>

14:00.272 --> 14:04.576
<i>At close of day,
Chuke reaches Klawock Lake.</i>

14:04.578 --> 14:06.311
[Chuke]
I believe that a Bigfoot

14:06.313 --> 14:08.880
may come through this area
because I've got reports

14:08.882 --> 14:11.282
that there has been
a number of sightings.

14:11.284 --> 14:12.684
<i>So, I thought it'd be great</i>

14:12.686 --> 14:14.619
<i>to put the trail cam up
and maybe see</i>

14:14.621 --> 14:18.389
if I can spot a Bigfoot
with the trail cam.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.059
<i>[narrator] This is where the most
frequent Sasquatch encounters</i>

14:21.061 --> 14:22.193
<i>have occurred,</i>

14:22.195 --> 14:25.096
<i>close to the foot
of Klawock Mountain.</i>

14:25.098 --> 14:28.933
<i>Here, Chuke secures
motion-activated cameras on the trees</i>

14:28.935 --> 14:31.703
<i>to see if he can catch
a glimpse of Bigfoot</i>

14:31.705 --> 14:36.574
<i>and track which direction they may
be heading towards their community.</i>

14:36.576 --> 14:39.277
[Chuke] Yeah, we're done here.
We're going to leave that...

14:40.246 --> 14:42.914
for the night and the morning,
see what...

14:42.916 --> 14:44.082
See if we captured anything.

14:44.084 --> 14:48.186
So, feeling positive that
we might capture something.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.993
[narrator] <i>But the Bigfoot
population here, it seems,</i>

14:54.995 --> 14:57.862
<i>are brave enough to venture
out of their territory</i>

14:57.864 --> 15:00.365
<i>without even the cover
of darkness.</i>

15:01.800 --> 15:04.269
<i>Locals recently had
an aggressive encounter</i>

15:04.271 --> 15:06.671
<i>with a Sasquatch
while out hunting,</i>

15:06.673 --> 15:09.507
<i>according
to islander Walter Frank.</i>

15:11.310 --> 15:14.679
Something starts throwing
big rocks at them.

15:14.681 --> 15:17.315
They were boulders,
great big boulders.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.118
But there were four or five
of them hunting at the time,

15:20.120 --> 15:22.253
and they all told the same story

15:22.255 --> 15:26.257
about the big boulders flying
out of the woods at them.

15:28.227 --> 15:29.460
[narrator]
<i>Walter and his friends</i>

15:29.462 --> 15:33.598
<i>could be living on the edge
of Bigfoot territory...</i>

15:33.600 --> 15:37.969
<i>And experts are concerned about
this increasingly violent behavior.</i>

15:38.837 --> 15:40.605
[Cliff]
<i>Bigfoot are territorial.</i>

15:40.607 --> 15:42.874
If you had
the encroachment of people,

15:42.876 --> 15:45.944
or a settlement of a town
of people coming in,

15:45.946 --> 15:47.612
wouldn't you also be bothered?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.615
You wouldn't want anyone
around your place of living.

15:50.617 --> 15:51.950
<i>There is a level of danger</i>

15:51.952 --> 15:55.086
<i>that people do need
to consider very seriously.</i>

15:55.088 --> 15:57.588
A Bigfoot, with his bare hands,

15:57.590 --> 16:00.358
<i>could take down an elk,
a moose, and even a bear.</i>

16:00.360 --> 16:02.160
So, a human,
or a group of humans,

16:02.162 --> 16:05.229
could easily be prey
for Bigfoot.

16:09.201 --> 16:11.069
[narrator] <i>Before he
continues on his journey,</i>

16:11.071 --> 16:14.038
<i>at his lodging,
Chuke checks the trail cams</i>

16:14.040 --> 16:17.275
<i>he left overnight at the foot
of Klawock Mountain.</i>

16:17.277 --> 16:19.177
<i>He's found evidence, it seems,</i>

16:19.179 --> 16:21.479
<i>that could point to Bigfoot.</i>

16:22.915 --> 16:25.717
[Chuke] So, I captured a deer
in the game cam.

16:25.719 --> 16:29.721
I find it interesting that its
ears are up, it looks alert.

16:29.723 --> 16:32.156
<i>[narrator] Perhaps it's seen
one of the island's Bigfoot</i>

16:32.158 --> 16:35.193
<i>hunting food near its territory.</i>

16:35.195 --> 16:37.895
There's no humans out here,
I know that for a fact,

16:37.897 --> 16:40.965
and the deer
is looking at something.

16:42.101 --> 16:45.303
<i>[narrator] And Chuke's
next trail cam picture is blurry.</i>

16:45.305 --> 16:48.339
<i>This leads
to a sinister conclusion.</i>

16:49.274 --> 16:51.142
[Chuke] The only way
I can explain this

16:51.144 --> 16:54.245
is, some creature that was tall,

16:54.247 --> 16:55.780
like a human being,

16:55.782 --> 16:58.516
grabbed the game cam
and moved it.

16:59.885 --> 17:02.153
<i>[narrator] This could be
a warning to Chuke</i>

17:02.155 --> 17:05.590
<i>not to step further
into Bigfoot territory.</i>

17:05.592 --> 17:07.592
[Chuke]
Something didn't like it

17:07.594 --> 17:09.060
or was checking it out.

17:09.062 --> 17:10.628
I don't know
what it could've been.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.163
There was no signs of bear.

17:12.165 --> 17:14.799
A deer couldn't stand up
that high,

17:14.801 --> 17:16.234
it's not going to move a camera.

17:16.802 --> 17:18.269
I think it was a Bigfoot.

17:19.505 --> 17:22.106
From the evidence
from these pictures,

17:22.108 --> 17:23.274
um...

17:23.276 --> 17:26.077
It makes me think
that something's out there.

17:27.012 --> 17:28.679
<i>[narrator] Now that Chuke
has found evidence</i>

17:28.681 --> 17:31.115
<i>of what he believes
are Bigfoot nearby,</i>

17:31.117 --> 17:35.720
<i>he's arming himself ready
for the final stage of his quest.</i>

17:35.722 --> 17:39.257
[Chuke] I think it could be a dangerous
journey that we're going to take.

17:39.259 --> 17:41.793
We just don't know
what we're going to encounter.

17:41.795 --> 17:44.162
<i>Something is out there.</i>

17:45.864 --> 17:48.766
<i>[narrator] His journey
to find the upside-down trees</i>

17:48.768 --> 17:51.869
<i>could take him deep
into Bigfoot territory</i>

17:51.871 --> 17:55.606
<i>and, perhaps, lead him to
the Sasquatch community itself.</i>

17:56.708 --> 17:58.342
<i>This is, after all,</i>

17:58.344 --> 18:00.912
<i>one of the most
treacherous corners</i>

18:00.914 --> 18:02.380
<i>of the Alaska Triangle.</i>

18:03.248 --> 18:05.183
Okay, I'm hearing stuff.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.452
I don't have a good feeling
about this.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.399
[narrator]
<i>Prince of Wales Island,</i>

18:21.401 --> 18:23.601
<i>in the South
of the Alaska Triangle.</i>

18:25.971 --> 18:28.106
<i>This small isle is said to home</i>

18:28.108 --> 18:30.908
<i>large numbers
of a terrifying creature,</i>

18:30.910 --> 18:32.210
<i>Bigfoot.</i>

18:33.112 --> 18:34.579
[creature growls]

18:34.581 --> 18:36.814
<i>It's said groups of them
have been spotted here,</i>

18:36.816 --> 18:38.449
<i>at close quarters.</i>

18:40.853 --> 18:43.721
<i>Perhaps the Triangle's
forces are conspiring</i>

18:43.723 --> 18:46.591
<i>with these cryptids
to create a new domain.</i>

18:48.193 --> 18:50.695
There's many instances
and sightings

18:50.697 --> 18:53.297
where people are encroaching
upon their territory,

18:53.299 --> 18:55.066
the Bigfoot attempts
to scare them off.

18:55.068 --> 18:56.601
[creature growls]

18:56.603 --> 18:59.370
<i>I believe Bigfoot
are very territorial.</i>

19:01.106 --> 19:03.141
[narrator] <i>Bigfoot
investigator Chuke Rowley</i>

19:03.143 --> 19:05.943
<i>has traveled 700 miles
from Anchorage</i>

19:05.945 --> 19:07.912
<i>to see maybe
the most sinister proof</i>

19:07.914 --> 19:10.214
<i>of its territorial behavior.</i>

19:11.850 --> 19:13.384
[Chuke]
<i>There are some famous cases</i>

19:13.386 --> 19:16.721
of trees ripped
right out of the ground,

19:16.723 --> 19:17.688
turned upside down,

19:17.690 --> 19:21.058
and shoved feet down
into the ground.

19:21.060 --> 19:23.594
<i>And that
has widely been theorized</i>

19:23.596 --> 19:27.298
<i>as a way for the Bigfoot
to scare people off,</i>

19:27.300 --> 19:28.166
<i>it's a show of strength.</i>

19:28.168 --> 19:29.367
[creature growls]

19:31.303 --> 19:33.938
[narrator] <i>To find these
trees steeped in legend,</i>

19:33.940 --> 19:37.341
<i>and evidence of the
Bigfoot community itself,</i>

19:37.343 --> 19:39.677
<i>Chuke has to go deep
into the forest</i>

19:39.679 --> 19:41.345
<i>to Klawock Mountain.</i>

19:43.382 --> 19:47.685
[Chuke] I have been dreaming
of visiting this place for years,

19:47.687 --> 19:50.254
so I'm really happy
to have this opportunity.

19:50.256 --> 19:55.326
This is the spot to go to, as
far as I'm concerned, in Alaska.

19:58.330 --> 20:00.665
<i>[narrator] But a Bigfoot
could be close by,</i>

20:00.667 --> 20:03.167
<i>ready to defend its territory.</i>

20:04.736 --> 20:07.205
<i>And even the terrain
seems deadly.</i>

20:08.740 --> 20:10.908
[Chuke] This is a rainforest
and, I have to say,

20:10.910 --> 20:13.611
this is
the most inhospitable place

20:13.613 --> 20:15.079
I have ever seen.

20:16.148 --> 20:17.281
There is so much foliage

20:17.283 --> 20:19.050
and it's covered up
the deadfall.

20:19.052 --> 20:22.253
There's so many deep pools
and swamps,

20:22.255 --> 20:25.122
you could put your foot
in ten-foot-long holes,

20:25.124 --> 20:26.190
steep mountains.

20:26.192 --> 20:28.159
I mean, it's impossible.

20:30.963 --> 20:33.731
[narrator] <i>Chuke has to
travel three miles by foot</i>

20:33.733 --> 20:37.034
<i>and a 1,500-foot elevation
up Klawock Mountain</i>

20:37.036 --> 20:40.404
<i>to find the legendary
upside-down trees.</i>

20:42.241 --> 20:45.042
<i>But stories of Sasquatch
have been passed down</i>

20:45.044 --> 20:46.010
<i>through the generations,</i>

20:46.012 --> 20:49.413
<i>warning locals
not to set foot here.</i>

20:54.152 --> 20:55.853
<i>As Chuke heads up the mountain,</i>

20:55.855 --> 20:57.955
<i>he hits upon something
of interest.</i>

20:58.257 --> 21:00.825
<i>Plentiful food sources.</i>

21:00.827 --> 21:03.494
<i>A Bigfoot colony
could thrive here.</i>

21:05.831 --> 21:07.064
[Chuke] There's game trails.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.166
I can't tell
what's been through it.

21:09.168 --> 21:14.105
Haven't found
any really succinct footprints

21:14.107 --> 21:18.276
but, you know, there's bear
and deer coming through here.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.345
These blueberries.

21:22.214 --> 21:26.884
Man, I pretty sure could live
up here all summer long,

21:26.886 --> 21:28.653
all fall long,
just eating these.

21:28.655 --> 21:30.021
Fish, deer.

21:31.223 --> 21:33.224
<i>[narrator] But, as Chuke
climbs the mountain,</i>

21:33.226 --> 21:35.826
<i>it seems the forces
of the Triangle</i>

21:35.828 --> 21:37.595
<i>are trying to hamper
his mission.</i>

21:39.965 --> 21:41.899
[Chuke] Rain's coming in.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.267
I don't know how long
I can do this.

21:43.269 --> 21:46.003
I've been hiking
for almost four hours...

21:46.838 --> 21:49.307
and I'm getting pretty tired.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.978
So, I don't know
if we're going to make it,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.413
and that really bums me out

21:55.415 --> 21:58.082
because this is a long way
to come for...

21:58.084 --> 21:59.183
for nothing.

21:59.185 --> 22:02.920
But I don't think
it's going to happen today.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.189
I don't think
we're going to see anything.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.069
[narrator] <i>Suddenly, Chuke
finds he may not be alone.</i>

22:18.071 --> 22:20.204
[rustling]

22:20.206 --> 22:22.006
Who's that?

22:31.550 --> 22:34.251
Okay, I'm hearing stuff
about 20 meters this way.

22:34.253 --> 22:36.287
I can't see anything.

22:36.289 --> 22:38.055
I don't have a good feeling
about this.

22:38.057 --> 22:39.924
Sometimes you just get
that feeling,

22:39.926 --> 22:43.027
and I feel like I was
not supposed to be there.

22:43.829 --> 22:47.031
Whatever's out there
is angry now.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.134
[narrator]
<i>Chuke may have gone too deep</i>

22:50.136 --> 22:52.536
<i>into the island's
Bigfoot territory.</i>

22:54.272 --> 22:57.942
<i>There could be a whole colony
of the creatures nearby.</i>

22:57.944 --> 23:00.077
I went somewhere
I shouldn't have.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.246
Now I feel like something's
after me.

23:02.248 --> 23:04.315
[narrator]
<i>This could only happen</i>

23:04.317 --> 23:07.118
<i>in the deadly Alaska Triangle.</i>

23:18.163 --> 23:20.598
[narrator] <i>Prince of
Wales Island in Alaska,</i>

23:20.600 --> 23:23.334
<i>believed to be home
to a colony of Bigfoot.</i>

23:24.603 --> 23:26.036
[creature growls]

23:26.872 --> 23:28.873
<i>Their territory
seems to lie somewhere</i>

23:28.875 --> 23:30.808
<i>on Klawock Mountain,</i>

23:30.810 --> 23:32.610
<i>and it's said
they've marked it out</i>

23:32.612 --> 23:35.980
<i>by mysteriously turning trees
upside down,</i>

23:35.982 --> 23:37.715
<i>then driving them
into the ground.</i>

23:37.717 --> 23:40.518
[creature growling]

23:42.287 --> 23:44.288
<i>Hunter Chuke Rowley
is on a mission</i>

23:44.290 --> 23:46.157
<i>to find these trees,</i>

23:46.159 --> 23:49.026
<i>perhaps leading to the
Sasquatch community itself.</i>

23:49.861 --> 23:52.129
[rustling]

23:52.131 --> 23:55.399
<i>But he's unnerved
by noises deep in the forest.</i>

23:59.037 --> 24:01.038
I keep hearing stuff.

24:01.807 --> 24:02.740
I need to get out of here.

24:02.742 --> 24:05.142
I...
I don't feel good about this.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.178
<i>[narrator] This could be
a warning from Bigfoot</i>

24:07.180 --> 24:10.514
<i>telling Chuke
not to venture any further.</i>

24:12.017 --> 24:14.318
Now I feel
like something's after me.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.086
I went somewhere
I shouldn't have,

24:16.088 --> 24:17.988
that's why it's closed up, and

24:17.990 --> 24:19.323
something's not happy.

24:21.426 --> 24:22.726
<i>[narrator] Chuke seems close</i>

24:22.761 --> 24:26.597
<i>to what the locals have
deemed the Bigfoot territory.</i>

24:26.599 --> 24:30.534
<i>Perhaps he's within reach of the
fabled trees he's been searching for.</i>

24:34.172 --> 24:35.573
<i>Chuke presses on...</i>

24:39.010 --> 24:42.079
<i>And something on the horizon
catches his eye.</i>

24:46.318 --> 24:48.586
[Chuke] Oh! We found it!

24:48.588 --> 24:51.622
That is an upside-down tree.

24:55.861 --> 24:59.563
<i>[narrator] At last, the Bigfoot
evidence Chuke's been looking for.</i>

25:06.571 --> 25:09.139
<i>And there are more
of these mighty trees here,</i>

25:09.141 --> 25:11.175
<i>seemingly driven into the ground</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:13.210
<i>by a colossal cryptid.</i>

25:14.946 --> 25:16.113
There's another one!

25:17.048 --> 25:19.216
This area must just have
a lot of these.

25:19.218 --> 25:22.219
There's another one!
It's incredible.

25:24.623 --> 25:27.091
<i>[narrator] For Chuke,
his quest to find proof</i>

25:27.093 --> 25:31.028
<i>of a Bigfoot territory
on the island is over.</i>

25:31.030 --> 25:36.367
This, to me, is the Holy Grail
of Bigfoot researching.

25:37.302 --> 25:38.168
[sighs]

25:38.436 --> 25:40.371
I've been talking
about this for years,

25:41.039 --> 25:42.239
and...

25:43.341 --> 25:46.377
To me, this is proof.
It's an upside-down tree.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.046
[narrator]
<i>This 12-foot cedar tree</i>

25:49.048 --> 25:52.850
<i>is estimated to weigh
over 2,500 pounds.</i>

25:52.852 --> 25:55.219
<i>That's the weight
of a small car.</i>

25:55.221 --> 25:58.022
<i>Only a monster
the size of a Bigfoot</i>

25:58.024 --> 26:00.391
<i>could've turned
this upside down.</i>

26:01.893 --> 26:04.261
[Chuke]
This is something intelligent,

26:04.263 --> 26:05.996
very strong, and very big.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.165
I mean, the locals
were telling me

26:08.167 --> 26:11.068
that there's
Bigfoot 13 feet tall.

26:11.070 --> 26:14.171
So, you think about a few
of them working together,

26:14.173 --> 26:16.240
they would be able to do
something like that.

26:16.242 --> 26:19.109
[suspense music]

26:19.111 --> 26:20.644
[narrator]
<i>So, it seems the Bigfoot</i>

26:20.646 --> 26:22.880
<i>are indeed marking out
their land.</i>

26:22.882 --> 26:27.251
<i>Perhaps it's a warning to
the island's human inhabitants.</i>

26:27.253 --> 26:31.055
I think this marks the
beginning of the Bigfoot territory,

26:31.057 --> 26:33.023
where they wanted people
to stay out of.

26:33.025 --> 26:34.458
They're showing their strength,

26:34.460 --> 26:36.594
is what the locals say.

26:36.596 --> 26:37.528
And...

26:39.030 --> 26:40.531
That's what this is.

26:41.866 --> 26:43.467
And I think
we should respect them.

26:44.836 --> 26:46.170
I know I do now.

26:47.572 --> 26:49.006
It's amazing.

26:51.977 --> 26:55.245
<i>[narrator] After witnessing
these trees with his very own eyes,</i>

26:55.247 --> 26:57.348
<i>Chuke has one word of caution</i>

26:57.350 --> 26:59.350
<i>for the Prince of Wales
islanders.</i>

27:01.620 --> 27:05.322
[Chuke] As long as humans can
stay away from these creatures,

27:05.324 --> 27:07.091
I think we'll keep the peace.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.828
But, in the future,
if humans and Bigfoot

27:10.830 --> 27:13.063
come together at some point,

27:13.065 --> 27:14.965
who knows
what's going to happen?

27:16.001 --> 27:18.135
<i>[narrator] For now,
it seems the island's Bigfoot</i>

27:18.137 --> 27:21.372
<i>and humans have largely
kept to their territories.</i>

27:23.041 --> 27:25.242
<i>But the Triangle
may be planning a bigger,</i>

27:25.244 --> 27:27.511
<i>more dominant Sasquatch colony</i>

27:27.513 --> 27:31.715
<i>that could one day spell
disaster for the islanders.</i>

27:31.717 --> 27:36.186
<i>After all, the Alaska Triangle
seems to hold many mysterious places</i>

27:36.188 --> 27:39.023
<i>where the paranormal
has taken over.</i>

27:39.025 --> 27:41.792
<i>There's one place,
though, where it seems</i>

27:41.794 --> 27:45.763
<i>to be working hand-in-hand
with even stranger creatures,</i>

27:45.765 --> 27:48.265
<i>perhaps from another planet.</i>

28:04.149 --> 28:06.050
<i>[narrator] Directly across
the Gulf of Alaska</i>

28:06.052 --> 28:07.785
<i>from Prince of Wales Island</i>

28:07.787 --> 28:09.953
<i>lies another island
that holds within it</i>

28:09.955 --> 28:12.556
<i>one of the Triangle's
greatest mysteries.</i>

28:13.591 --> 28:16.560
<i>There are places here
where few have ventured.</i>

28:17.662 --> 28:21.331
<i>There are also places
that are strictly off-limits.</i>

28:24.602 --> 28:28.305
<i>This is Kodiak Island
and, over the years,</i>

28:28.307 --> 28:30.574
<i>strange things
have been seen here</i>

28:30.576 --> 28:32.976
<i>that have defied explanation.</i>

28:34.079 --> 28:36.280
<i>Whatever's hiding
in the wilderness,</i>

28:37.148 --> 28:41.085
<i>it could be something
truly out of this world.</i>

28:42.721 --> 28:44.988
There's definitely
something out there.

28:44.990 --> 28:49.259
This island in Alaska
holds immense secrets.

28:50.762 --> 28:52.963
<i>[Andrew] This is
simply extraordinary.</i>

28:52.965 --> 28:55.933
What goes on, on Kodiak Island?

28:55.935 --> 28:59.503
[typing machine]

29:03.074 --> 29:05.142
<i>[narrator] So much
of the Alaska Triangle</i>

29:05.144 --> 29:07.144
<i>is wild and uninhabited.</i>

29:08.613 --> 29:10.280
<i>But one
of its most remote corners</i>

29:10.282 --> 29:12.149
<i>is the island of Kodiak.</i>

29:13.218 --> 29:15.319
<i>At around 3,500 square miles,</i>

29:15.321 --> 29:18.789
<i>it's the second largest
island in the US,</i>

29:18.791 --> 29:22.192
<i>but only 13,000 people
live here.</i>

29:22.194 --> 29:25.629
<i>A large proportion
of it is total wilderness,</i>

29:25.631 --> 29:27.965
<i>ideal
for secret military training,</i>

29:27.967 --> 29:31.735
<i>and home to only a handful
of the heartiest people.</i>

29:31.737 --> 29:35.873
[Jonny] Even for Alaska,
Kodiak Island is very remote.

29:35.875 --> 29:39.843
I mean, two-thirds of this
place is a wildlife refuge.

29:39.845 --> 29:42.546
<i>If you want to escape,
this is the place to come.</i>

29:45.617 --> 29:46.884
<i>[narrator] Back in 2003,</i>

29:46.886 --> 29:49.119
<i>Jenni Walker moved
with her family</i>

29:49.121 --> 29:52.489
<i>to one of the more
out-of-the-way parts of the island.</i>

29:54.225 --> 29:58.695
<i>They were surrounded by hundreds
of square miles of Kodiak wilderness.</i>

29:58.697 --> 30:02.766
No power, no cable,
no phone lines.

30:02.768 --> 30:05.402
We ran our ranch off
of a generator.

30:06.437 --> 30:10.140
Back there, where we lived,
there was nothing.

30:11.142 --> 30:15.145
[narrator] <i>In the early morning
of September 25th, 2007,</i>

30:15.147 --> 30:18.115
<i>Jenni experienced something
a few miles from home</i>

30:18.117 --> 30:20.217
<i>that shocked her to the core.</i>

30:22.954 --> 30:25.122
<i>[Jenni] I was taking my son
to school</i>

30:25.124 --> 30:28.992
at approximately 6:30,
7:00 in the morning.

30:28.994 --> 30:31.628
<i>It was fairly dark still then.</i>

30:33.965 --> 30:37.267
<i>All of a sudden,
out of the corner of my eye,</i>

30:37.269 --> 30:40.037
<i>I look up at the top
of the ridge</i>

30:40.039 --> 30:44.041
<i>and there was something,</i>

30:44.043 --> 30:47.177
which we thought
was an aircraft,

30:47.812 --> 30:50.080
that was on fire.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.918
<i>It was something
literally traveling with us,</i>

30:54.920 --> 30:56.820
<i>in the same direction
we were traveling,</i>

30:56.822 --> 31:00.490
but it was moving way faster.

31:06.064 --> 31:09.600
<i>[narrator] Having stopped, they
could see that it wasn't an airplane,</i>

31:09.602 --> 31:12.369
<i>but it was a flying craft
of some kind.</i>

31:14.706 --> 31:17.808
[Jenni] Once it got
in front of us,

31:17.810 --> 31:20.244
then that's when we could see
it start going down.

31:20.812 --> 31:24.014
[explosion echoes]

31:24.016 --> 31:26.783
<i>[narrator] Whatever it was
crashed beyond the ridge.</i>

31:26.785 --> 31:29.353
<i>Jenni heard
and felt the explosion.</i>

31:29.355 --> 31:32.289
<i>It's a moment
she'll never forget.</i>

31:32.291 --> 31:33.924
<i>[Jenni] I was horrified.</i>

31:33.926 --> 31:37.294
I could never imagine seeing
something like that in my lifetime.

31:38.162 --> 31:40.264
<i>[narrator] Jenni called 911.</i>

31:40.266 --> 31:43.567
<i>It was obvious to her that
this was a major disaster.</i>

31:43.569 --> 31:44.868
[sirens wailing]

31:44.870 --> 31:50.374
The fire department, troopers,
everybody started showing up,

31:50.376 --> 31:53.977
<i>and you could hear the
helicopters flying around.</i>

31:53.979 --> 31:55.312
[helicopter blades whirring]

31:55.314 --> 31:57.180
They were there
for hours and hours,

31:57.182 --> 31:59.149
just waiting for the helicopter,

31:59.151 --> 32:03.020
you know, to say, "Oh,
here it is. There, we found it."

32:03.022 --> 32:06.590
But I just remember them telling
me that they never found anything.

32:06.592 --> 32:07.791
That was it.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.092
[sirens wailing]

32:09.094 --> 32:10.994
<i>[narrator] But Jenni
knew what she'd seen</i>

32:10.996 --> 32:13.463
<i>and, thankfully,
she got her evidence.</i>

32:14.799 --> 32:18.835
[Jenni] It was ash
falling from the sky.

32:18.837 --> 32:22.606
<i>So, at that point,
they knew I wasn't crazy</i>

32:22.608 --> 32:26.443
<i>and that something had
streamed across that skyline.</i>

32:27.245 --> 32:29.947
<i>[narrator] Journalist
and researcher Jonny Enoch</i>

32:29.949 --> 32:32.249
<i>has been looking
into Jenni's story.</i>

32:33.217 --> 32:35.886
[Jonny] I found this report
from a local paper online,

32:35.888 --> 32:38.121
and it verifies Jenni's story.

32:38.123 --> 32:42.225
It says, "Several Kodiakans
saw something fall

32:42.227 --> 32:45.595
from the sky,
but no crash site was found."

32:45.597 --> 32:46.997
This bit is interesting.

32:46.999 --> 32:49.099
It says,
"No emergency distress signals

32:49.101 --> 32:51.601
were received," and,
"The authorities

32:51.603 --> 32:54.404
have accounted
for Kodiak-based aircraft

32:54.406 --> 32:56.606
and known flight plans
in the area."

32:57.275 --> 32:59.209
And yet, all the time afterwards

32:59.211 --> 33:02.045
when Jenni was trying
to find out what happened,

33:02.047 --> 33:05.349
they said there was no crash
and nothing was found.

33:06.217 --> 33:07.951
[Jenni]
<i>I'd ask in town every day,</i>

33:07.953 --> 33:09.119
<i>"Did they find anything?"
Nope.</i>

33:09.121 --> 33:11.154
<i>Nobody found nothing.</i>

33:11.156 --> 33:15.325
And I just couldn't believe
that they couldn't find it.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.828
[Andrew]
<i>This is highly unusual.</i>

33:17.830 --> 33:22.199
A large flying craft
crashes in the wilderness,

33:22.201 --> 33:26.236
but there's no report of any
airplanes that have gone missing.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.205
<i>No satellite has come down,</i>

33:28.207 --> 33:31.375
<i>and it can't have been a meteor.</i>

33:31.377 --> 33:33.877
<i>It was flying, not falling.</i>

33:33.879 --> 33:36.013
Something happened here.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.716
<i>[narrator] The big question
for Jenni is whether or not</i>

33:39.718 --> 33:42.586
<i>what she witnessed
was a crashing UFO.</i>

33:43.855 --> 33:47.024
<i>If so, it wouldn't be
the first time a UFO</i>

33:47.026 --> 33:49.526
<i>was spotted in this part
of the Alaska Triangle.</i>

33:50.094 --> 33:51.528
<i>Far from it.</i>

33:53.698 --> 33:56.266
<i>Debbie Ziegelmeyer,
of the Mutual UFO Network,</i>

33:56.268 --> 33:58.769
<i>has been collating
the Kodiak sightings,</i>

33:58.771 --> 34:00.871
<i>and she thinks
it's the very remoteness</i>

34:00.873 --> 34:04.141
<i>of the island
that's attracting them.</i>

34:04.143 --> 34:06.877
<i>[Debbie] That whole area
is really active.</i>

34:06.879 --> 34:08.245
I think a lot of it
just had to do

34:08.247 --> 34:11.615
with the vast amount
of unpopulated area.

34:11.617 --> 34:13.817
<i>There could be so much going on,</i>

34:13.819 --> 34:16.420
but there's nobody there.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.021
[narrator]
<i>The sightings from Kodiak</i>

34:18.023 --> 34:19.156
<i>that Debbie has documented</i>

34:19.158 --> 34:21.324
<i>include flying-saucer-like craft</i>

34:21.326 --> 34:24.995
<i>of the kind seen by Jenni,
as well as more distant,</i>

34:24.997 --> 34:27.731
<i>less-defined bodies of light.</i>

34:27.733 --> 34:29.966
Most of the sightings
that I researched

34:29.968 --> 34:34.571
were either silver,
metallic, saucer-shaped craft,

34:34.573 --> 34:38.308
<i>or strange,
unexplained balls of light</i>

34:38.310 --> 34:41.445
<i>that will hover for a while
and then move rapidly</i>

34:41.447 --> 34:43.647
<i>out into the distance.</i>

34:43.649 --> 34:47.918
<i>One of them in particular had
one great, big, bright yellow in front</i>

34:47.920 --> 34:50.821
<i>and two other white lights
behind it,</i>

34:50.823 --> 34:52.856
<i>and then just moved
kind of up at an angle</i>

34:52.858 --> 34:54.691
<i>and, then,
shut off really quick.</i>

34:54.693 --> 34:57.160
<i>But that seems to be a lot
of what's going on.</i>

34:57.162 --> 34:58.895
<i>There could be craft
coming in and out all day</i>

34:58.897 --> 35:00.964
and nobody's going to see it.

35:00.966 --> 35:03.667
[narrator] <i>Now, an
extraordinary military report</i>

35:03.669 --> 35:05.569
<i>has come to light that suggests</i>

35:05.571 --> 35:09.172
<i>not only are there UFO
in the skies above Kodiak,</i>

35:09.174 --> 35:12.142
<i>but that aliens
have actually landed.</i>

35:25.590 --> 35:28.225
<i>[narrator] Kodiak Island is
one of the most remote places</i>

35:28.227 --> 35:29.860
<i>in the Alaska Triangle,</i>

35:29.862 --> 35:31.695
<i>and there's now
increasing evidence</i>

35:31.697 --> 35:34.197
<i>of substantial UFO activity.</i>

35:34.832 --> 35:37.968
<i>Video evidence is rare
but, in 2012,</i>

35:37.970 --> 35:42.072
<i>this strange flashing light
was captured over the island.</i>

35:42.074 --> 35:44.641
<i>It's moving too fast
to be an aircraft,</i>

35:44.643 --> 35:48.345
<i>and isn't displaying the
mandatory aircraft strobe lights.</i>

35:51.749 --> 35:55.986
<i>Then, in October 2018,
this video was taken.</i>

35:55.988 --> 35:58.655
<i>It shows the bottom
of an orange orb</i>

35:58.657 --> 36:01.758
<i>that's hovering
over Kodiak Town.</i>

36:01.760 --> 36:04.394
<i>It doesn't look
like the sun or the moon,</i>

36:04.396 --> 36:06.897
<i>and the time and location
in the night sky</i>

36:06.899 --> 36:08.331
<i>doesn't fit for either.</i>

36:08.966 --> 36:10.567
<i>It can only be described</i>

36:10.569 --> 36:13.336
<i>as an unidentified
flying object.</i>

36:14.939 --> 36:19.009
<i>In fact, sightings of UFOs
over Kodiak go way back.</i>

36:19.977 --> 36:22.279
<i>Investigative journalist
Andrew Gough</i>

36:22.281 --> 36:25.582
<i>has been looking
into one case from 1950</i>

36:25.584 --> 36:28.218
<i>that sent shockwaves
to the highest level.</i>

36:29.153 --> 36:31.221
[Andrew] Look at this.
This is astonishing.

36:31.223 --> 36:35.559
It's an official report
from the US Navy from 1950.

36:35.561 --> 36:38.862
<i>A Navy pilot
witnessed a UFO out here.</i>

36:38.864 --> 36:43.066
It was clocked on radar going
over 1,800 miles per hour.

36:43.801 --> 36:46.937
<i>The plane's
radar operator reported,</i>

36:46.939 --> 36:49.973
<i>you know, the strangest
interference he had ever seen.</i>

36:49.975 --> 36:52.509
The control tower
was in a state of panic.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.613
<i>Then, suddenly,
the UFO vanished.</i>

36:56.615 --> 36:59.950
The Navy chiefs
issued a top-secret report

36:59.952 --> 37:03.053
to the highest levels
of the US government.

37:04.088 --> 37:05.488
I mean, it's extraordinary.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.191
Who knows about this?

37:09.760 --> 37:13.897
<i>[narrator] Something in Kodiak
seems to be attracting these UFOs.</i>

37:13.899 --> 37:17.133
<i>Perhaps it's the sparseness
of the population.</i>

37:18.135 --> 37:22.205
<i>But Andrew Gough suspects
there's more to it than that.</i>

37:22.207 --> 37:24.174
[Andrew] You've got
to look at the fact

37:24.176 --> 37:28.378
that the US Army
and Navy regard Kodiak

37:28.380 --> 37:30.013
<i>as a really strategic location</i>

37:30.015 --> 37:33.883
<i>where they have advanced
military activity and development.</i>

37:33.885 --> 37:36.753
<i>So, if you're a UFO
and you want to spy</i>

37:36.755 --> 37:38.288
<i>and see what's coming
down the pipe</i>

37:38.290 --> 37:41.958
in terms of new technology,
this is where you'd look.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.760
I think it's
a distinct possibility

37:43.762 --> 37:45.895
that's what's going on.

37:45.897 --> 37:47.964
<i>[narrator] But this
might not be all there is</i>

37:47.966 --> 37:52.302
<i>to the connection between
the military and these UFOs.</i>

37:52.304 --> 37:55.472
<i>Jonny Enoch has now uncovered
a shocking report</i>

37:55.474 --> 37:58.074
<i>about an incident here
that suggests collusion</i>

37:58.076 --> 38:03.046
<i>between the higher ranks and some
unknown mysterious intelligence.</i>

38:03.048 --> 38:05.682
Now, Kodiak Island
is an important base

38:05.684 --> 38:08.618
for military training,
and Navy SEALs go there

38:08.620 --> 38:11.688
<i>to conduct their special
cold-weather training.</i>

38:11.690 --> 38:14.557
<i>They have a base at a place
called Spruce Cape.</i>

38:15.760 --> 38:19.095
This highly sensitive report
was sent anonymously,

38:19.097 --> 38:21.298
for understandable reasons,
to MUFON,

38:21.300 --> 38:25.068
the Mutual UFO Network, in 2015.

38:25.070 --> 38:26.569
And this is what is says.

38:27.204 --> 38:30.440
A small group
were on a remote maneuver.

38:32.743 --> 38:35.578
<i>They were making good progress
towards their BDL,</i>

38:35.580 --> 38:38.114
<i>or their bed down location.</i>

38:40.084 --> 38:42.285
<i>Because they were
making good progress,</i>

38:42.287 --> 38:44.354
<i>they decided to push on further,</i>

38:44.356 --> 38:46.389
<i>trying to impress
their commanding officer</i>

38:46.391 --> 38:48.258
<i>with their new BDL.</i>

38:50.895 --> 38:55.699
After a while, they post a
radio through their new location,

38:55.701 --> 38:58.468
<i>but they didn't get the
response they were expecting.</i>

38:59.870 --> 39:03.773
<i>In fact, their commanding officer
flipped out and became frantic,</i>

39:03.775 --> 39:07.177
<i>and told them
to leave the area immediately.</i>

39:07.179 --> 39:11.147
<i>He actually asked them if they
had seen anyone or anything.</i>

39:11.149 --> 39:15.285
<i>Note, anyone or anything.</i>

39:15.287 --> 39:18.021
<i>They made their way back,
totally in the dark</i>

39:18.023 --> 39:20.256
<i>about what the fuss
was all about.</i>

39:21.892 --> 39:23.259
<i>That's all strange enough,</i>

39:23.261 --> 39:25.462
but now it gets weirder still.

39:27.732 --> 39:31.034
<i>When they got back to base,
they were interrogated</i>

39:31.036 --> 39:34.137
<i>by mysterious men-in-black
type government agents.</i>

39:36.073 --> 39:38.007
<i>And they were sworn to secrecy</i>

39:38.009 --> 39:41.378
<i>and told never to breathe
another word of this meeting again.</i>

39:43.180 --> 39:44.848
<i>They were asked if they had seen</i>

39:44.850 --> 39:47.817
<i>any other human-type beings
of any kind,</i>

39:47.819 --> 39:50.520
or any evidence
of some technology out there.

39:52.056 --> 39:54.023
<i>They didn't understand
any of this</i>

39:54.025 --> 39:56.159
<i>because they hadn't seen
anything.</i>

39:57.027 --> 39:59.162
And, when they asked
what was going on,

39:59.164 --> 40:02.899
<i>they were told there were
"The Others" up there.</i>

40:02.901 --> 40:05.702
<i>After the debrief,
they asked their CO</i>

40:05.704 --> 40:08.538
<i>who "The Others" were
and what was going on,</i>

40:08.540 --> 40:12.809
and he just told them never
to mention this incident again.

40:12.811 --> 40:16.980
<i>As you can imagine, they were
really shaken up by all of this.</i>

40:16.982 --> 40:19.682
This is all really bizarre,
but it seems to me

40:19.684 --> 40:22.118
like the Navy SEALs
stumbled into a place

40:22.120 --> 40:25.588
<i>where humans and aliens
were working together.</i>

40:25.590 --> 40:28.792
<i>Does that mean that there are
these elements</i>

40:28.794 --> 40:30.593
<i>of the military
or secret services</i>

40:30.595 --> 40:33.997
<i>working with aliens on
some sort of new technology?</i>

40:33.999 --> 40:36.132
<i>A technological exchange
of some kind.</i>

40:36.134 --> 40:39.002
It's fascinating
and totally shocking.

40:40.237 --> 40:43.540
<i>[narrator] If the suspicions of
the anonymous report were right,</i>

40:43.542 --> 40:45.642
<i>then the Navy SEALs
could have stumbled</i>

40:45.644 --> 40:49.512
<i>upon the biggest secret in
the history of the US military.</i>

40:51.015 --> 40:53.349
<i>[Andrew] Not only does this
suggest that alien life forms</i>

40:53.351 --> 40:55.151
<i>have landed on Kodiak</i>

40:55.153 --> 40:58.121
and the military
is aware of that,

40:58.123 --> 41:02.058
but it appears as though
they're working in unison.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.560
That's unbelievable!

41:05.496 --> 41:06.796
[narrator]
<i>For local residents,</i>

41:06.798 --> 41:09.732
<i>the suspicion is
that there is secret activity</i>

41:09.734 --> 41:13.369
<i>going on, on Kodiak and that,
despite official denials,</i>

41:13.371 --> 41:18.041
<i>the burning craft
witnessed by Jenni was a UFO.</i>

41:18.043 --> 41:19.075
We seen it.

41:19.077 --> 41:21.311
We know it was there.

41:21.313 --> 41:24.280
<i>And there's people trying
to tell us that it wasn't there.</i>

41:25.282 --> 41:27.183
[explosion echoes]

41:27.185 --> 41:32.222
<i>Either there was something
there that disappeared,</i>

41:32.224 --> 41:35.992
<i>or there was something there
that they covered up.</i>

41:37.161 --> 41:41.097
There is a lot going on
on that island.

41:41.732 --> 41:43.566
[narrator]
<i>Aliens drawn to Kodiak</i>

41:43.568 --> 41:47.170
<i>by the strange forces
of the Alaska Triangle.</i>

41:47.172 --> 41:49.739
<i>If the military
is in contact with them,</i>

41:49.741 --> 41:52.842
<i>we can only speculate
about the reasons.</i>

41:52.844 --> 41:55.211
<i>The mysteries of the triangle</i>

41:55.213 --> 41:59.449
<i>are truly as dark and deep
as they are extraordinary.</i>
