00:01.999 --> 00:05.001
I knew that you were switched.

00:05.036 --> 00:08.170
I found out 12 and a half
year ago when Daphne was 3.

00:08.206 --> 00:10.407
<i>Angelo secretly had her D.N.A. tested.</i>

00:10.441 --> 00:12.275
He came back with the results saying

00:12.310 --> 00:14.311
I had to have had an affair.

00:14.345 --> 00:16.413
<i>- I hadn't.
- We find in favor of the plaintiff,</i>

00:16.447 --> 00:19.349
Angelo Sorrento, in the
amount of $5,000,000.

00:21.052 --> 00:22.419
<i>- Completely restored.
- John: At this rate,</i>

00:22.453 --> 00:24.154
he'll blow through it in six months.

00:24.388 --> 00:26.589
I'm up to my ears with
bills for the restaurant.

00:26.624 --> 00:28.425
And now you owe 50 grand?!

00:28.459 --> 00:30.593
What's this mean?

00:30.628 --> 00:32.362
This means we foreclosed.

00:32.396 --> 00:33.563
Isn't there something you can do?

00:33.797 --> 00:35.765
I thought this

00:35.799 --> 00:38.835
<i>was supposed to be when
everything came together,</i>

00:38.869 --> 00:40.670
but it fell apart.

00:40.704 --> 00:41.738
I'll see you tomorrow.

00:44.575 --> 00:45.708
- (Phone rings)
- (Kathryn groans)

00:45.743 --> 00:47.610
- What is it?
- There's been an accident.

00:47.645 --> 00:48.745
- Pull.
- All right, let's see what we got.

00:48.779 --> 00:50.446
Contusions on the face and neck.

00:50.481 --> 00:52.782
- No clear indications...
- Any signs of spinal injury?

00:52.816 --> 00:55.418
<i>- _

00:55.452 --> 00:57.520

01:00.724 --> 01:03.459
- You lied to me.
- What are you talking about?

01:03.494 --> 01:05.695
- What is this?
- That's a D.N.A. test.

01:05.729 --> 01:08.398
It's proof that Daphne is not my daughter.

01:08.432 --> 01:09.832
Green eyes and freckles,

01:09.867 --> 01:11.634
you really think I'm stupid, huh?

01:11.669 --> 01:13.603
<i>(Elevator dings)</i>

01:13.637 --> 01:16.372
We have been over this a million times.

01:16.407 --> 01:17.674
I didn't have an affair.

01:17.708 --> 01:20.510
Daphne is your daughter!

01:20.544 --> 01:21.778
Where is this coming from?

01:21.812 --> 01:23.813
My word has always been
good enough for you.

01:25.649 --> 01:29.385
Wait, is this because the
doctors are saying she's deaf?

01:30.821 --> 01:32.689
That's ridiculous!

01:32.723 --> 01:36.492
Look, I know that you are scared.

01:36.527 --> 01:37.527
I am too.

01:37.561 --> 01:39.395
It's not because she's deaf.

01:39.430 --> 01:41.598
I don't want to raise another man's child.

01:41.632 --> 01:43.466
Is this test even real?

01:43.500 --> 01:44.767
I mean, maybe you're making it up

01:44.802 --> 01:46.803
so you will have an excuse to walk away.

01:46.837 --> 01:48.638
- Gina...
- You know what?!

01:48.672 --> 01:51.541
- You are off the hook.
- I just want the truth!

01:51.575 --> 01:54.744
I'm serious. Go home, pack your stuff

01:54.778 --> 01:56.579
and get out.

01:56.614 --> 01:58.548
We'll be better off without you.

<i>Kathryn: We got here as soon as we could.</i>

02:56.774 --> 02:58.608
When did you find out?

02:58.642 --> 02:59.642
<i>Regina: About an hour ago.</i>

02:59.677 --> 03:00.643
The police called me.

03:00.678 --> 03:02.478
- Any news?
- What happened?

03:02.513 --> 03:05.348
Apparently, he ran off
the road and hit a tree.

03:05.382 --> 03:06.616
They think he has a brain injury.

03:07.718 --> 03:09.719
Do they know what caused it?

03:09.753 --> 03:12.522
They said maybe a deer ran across the road

03:12.556 --> 03:14.424
- and he swerved.
- Anyone else hurt?

03:14.458 --> 03:16.459
- No.
- Regina Vasquez?

03:16.493 --> 03:19.328
How is he?

03:19.363 --> 03:20.697
Your husband's out of surgery. He's stable

03:20.731 --> 03:22.465
and being transferred to the I.C.U.

03:22.499 --> 03:23.666
(Both sigh)

03:23.701 --> 03:24.734
Oh, thank God.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.641
He suffered a cerebral
hemorrhage from the crash.

03:31.675 --> 03:33.643
We performed an endovascular coiling

03:33.677 --> 03:37.413
to reduce the swelling and
prevent further bleeding.

03:37.448 --> 03:40.349
But he's gonna be okay, right?

03:40.384 --> 03:42.385
He's in serious condition.

03:42.419 --> 03:44.520
We won't know anything
for a couple of days.

03:44.555 --> 03:47.790
That said, he's young
and otherwise healthy...

03:47.825 --> 03:49.592
both factors in his favor.

03:49.660 --> 03:51.360
Can we see him?

03:51.395 --> 03:52.361
Two at a time.

03:53.630 --> 03:54.764
Maybe I should go first.

03:54.798 --> 03:57.366
We're fine. We can handle it.

03:58.836 --> 04:00.369
We're all going in.

04:06.543 --> 04:08.644
(Respirator hissing)

04:42.412 --> 04:43.679
It's okay, sweetheart.

04:43.714 --> 04:45.615
You're gonna be okay.

04:58.562 --> 05:00.363
<i>Doctor: Morning, ladies.</i>

05:00.397 --> 05:01.531
Has he been awake?

05:01.565 --> 05:04.333
Not since we first saw him.

05:04.368 --> 05:06.502
- Is that bad?
- Oh no.

05:06.537 --> 05:09.639
Not necessarily. He's been
through a major trauma.

05:09.673 --> 05:11.340
<i>Sleep allows the body to heal.</i>

05:11.375 --> 05:13.442
How do you know how is brain is doing?

05:13.477 --> 05:14.710
See here?

05:14.745 --> 05:16.779
Cerebral perfusion pressure

05:16.814 --> 05:20.383
tells us the pressure
driving blood from his heart

05:20.417 --> 05:21.684
to his head.

05:21.718 --> 05:23.519
20 or below is normal.

05:23.554 --> 05:25.388
Your father is at 19.

05:25.422 --> 05:27.590
So a higher number

05:27.624 --> 05:30.393
means more bleeding?

05:30.427 --> 05:31.694
Correct.

05:31.762 --> 05:32.728
You pre-med?

05:32.763 --> 05:34.564
I'm hoping to be.

05:34.598 --> 05:36.666
I'll check back in a couple hours.

05:38.435 --> 05:40.503
John: I don't care what
his maximum is, okay?

05:40.537 --> 05:42.471
I will cover whatever you wont!

05:44.608 --> 05:46.342
<i>I don't know, but I would imagine</i>

05:46.376 --> 05:47.810
<i>a few more weeks in the hospital</i>

05:47.845 --> 05:50.513
<i>and some kind of physical therapy at home.</i>

05:55.786 --> 05:58.821
Honey, the S.A.T. is today.

05:58.856 --> 06:00.723
That doesn't matter.

06:00.757 --> 06:02.525
Of course it does.

06:02.559 --> 06:03.693
You said you need a higher score

06:03.727 --> 06:06.329
in order to get into a good pre-med program.

06:06.363 --> 06:07.597
This is your last chance to take it.

06:07.631 --> 06:09.298
Mom, I'm not gonna leave you.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.533
I'm fine.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.668
And... (Sighs)

06:12.703 --> 06:14.403
Angelo could be here for days,

06:14.438 --> 06:15.571
maybe weeks.

06:15.606 --> 06:17.306
Life has to go on.

06:18.742 --> 06:20.376
He would want you to go.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.347
Okay.

06:27.784 --> 06:29.585
<i>Toby: Uh, Regina,</i>

06:29.620 --> 06:31.621
the police are here to see you.

06:31.655 --> 06:33.623
- Police?
- They want to ask

06:33.657 --> 06:34.657
a couple questions about the accident.

06:34.691 --> 06:36.459
Okay.

06:45.402 --> 06:46.769
Can you do me a favor?

06:46.803 --> 06:49.338
Sure, anything.

06:49.373 --> 06:51.340
Do you see this number?

06:51.375 --> 06:54.377
If it goes above 20, I need you to text me.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.580
I can do that.

07:04.454 --> 07:06.555
<i>Policeman: Do you know if
he had anything to drink?</i>

07:06.590 --> 07:08.391
No. No, no.

07:08.425 --> 07:10.326
Angelo would never drink and drive.

07:10.360 --> 07:12.728
How did he seem when he left?

07:15.332 --> 07:16.632
<i>Regina: What are you saying?!</i>

07:16.667 --> 07:17.667
<i>That I'm cheating?!</i>

07:17.701 --> 07:20.736
- Are you?!
- Are you kidding me?!

07:20.771 --> 07:24.540
Can I remind you that you
are the one that left us

07:24.574 --> 07:27.376
and then had a baby with another woman!

07:27.411 --> 07:29.345
You couldn't raise that
one either, could you?!

07:31.448 --> 07:33.349
Did he give you any reason to think

07:33.383 --> 07:35.318
that something might be wrong?

07:35.352 --> 07:36.452
No.

07:36.486 --> 07:37.687
If we're done here,

07:37.721 --> 07:39.488
I'd like to get back to my husband.

07:39.523 --> 07:41.590
Of course. I appreciate your help.

07:42.693 --> 07:44.727
See you in a bit.

07:48.899 --> 07:52.535
So we hear he might have
been trying to avoid a deer.

07:52.569 --> 07:54.503
Tire marks indicate he swerved.

07:54.538 --> 07:56.539
Any other theories?

07:56.573 --> 07:58.607
Isolated crash, no eye-witnesses...

07:58.642 --> 08:01.277
could have been a hit-and-run,

08:01.311 --> 08:02.545
suicide attempt.

08:03.647 --> 08:05.281
Suicide? No.

08:05.315 --> 08:06.615
Not Angelo.

08:06.650 --> 08:09.618
In my experience, it's usually
the ones you least expect.

08:09.653 --> 08:12.288
Anyway, thank you for your time.

08:12.322 --> 08:13.322
No, thank you.

08:14.691 --> 08:16.359

08:44.454 --> 08:46.322
No phones allowed during the exam.

08:46.356 --> 08:48.491
I have a family member in the hospital

08:48.525 --> 08:50.326
and they need to be able to reach me

08:50.360 --> 08:51.460
in case of emergency.

08:51.495 --> 08:53.529
I'm sorry. Rules are rules.

08:53.563 --> 08:55.398
It's a really serious condition.

08:55.432 --> 08:56.732
Can't you make an exception?

08:56.767 --> 08:58.601
You can have it back after the test.

09:12.716 --> 09:14.717
Bay: So once you're
back across the driveway,

09:14.751 --> 09:16.719
we should probably start
working on my French.

09:26.329 --> 09:27.563
Oh.

You always said you were gonna
be my tour guide in Paris.

And I'm gonna hold you to that, okay?

10:17.814 --> 10:19.381
It's a date then.

Whoa, what's happening?

10:25.455 --> 10:26.722
Whoa, okay, somebody help!

10:26.756 --> 10:28.557
Somebody help! Help! Help!

10:31.495 --> 10:32.695
Okay, give us some room.

10:35.465 --> 10:37.533
Cerebral pressure is spiking.

10:37.567 --> 10:38.601
It might be another bleed.

10:38.635 --> 10:39.668
What does that mean?

10:39.703 --> 10:40.636
Pupils are sluggish.

10:42.405 --> 10:43.806
Page Dr. Larkin and clear room in the O.R.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.741
O.R.? I don't understand.
Is he gonna be okay?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.510
We're gonna do everything we can.

12:54.549 --> 12:58.418
to just sit here and wait?

12:58.453 --> 12:59.519
It's like torture.

12:59.554 --> 13:02.389
Sweetie, I know this is hard,

13:02.423 --> 13:06.259
but we just have to let
the doctors do their job.

13:06.294 --> 13:08.462
I just wish there was something I could do.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.563
I know.

13:12.633 --> 13:15.235
You know what? I'm gonna do something.

13:19.340 --> 13:21.408
I've never done this before.

13:22.577 --> 13:24.311
Could this go to my dad?

13:24.345 --> 13:26.446
My biological dad, Angelo Sorrento,

13:26.481 --> 13:28.315
he's in surgery right now.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.383
I'll make it as a directed donation, yes.

13:30.418 --> 13:32.285
Okay, make a fist.

13:32.320 --> 13:35.155
Good girl. Okay.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.623
Huh, well, this isn't so bad.

13:36.657 --> 13:39.292
(Steady breaths)

13:44.398 --> 13:46.500
Not bad at all.

13:46.534 --> 13:48.335
Honey, you okay?

13:49.470 --> 13:51.438
<i>(Bay screams)</i>

13:51.472 --> 13:53.540
No, I am not okay!

13:53.574 --> 13:55.275
I feel like the guy in Alien

13:55.309 --> 13:56.576
right before his stomach explodes!

13:56.611 --> 13:57.945
- (Uneven breaths)
- You're doing fine.

13:57.999 --> 13:59.066
Oh, I don't think these babies

13:59.100 --> 14:00.167
are gonna wait much longer!

14:00.201 --> 14:02.102
- Where the hell is he?!
- Okay, he'll be here.

14:02.136 --> 14:03.971
- Okay, he'll be here.
- He didn't have a problem

14:04.005 --> 14:05.105
showing up nine months ago!

14:05.139 --> 14:07.107
- Ah!
- How about John and Kathryn?

14:07.141 --> 14:09.042
Their flight lands in an hour! Ah! Ah!

14:09.077 --> 14:10.210
Okay, okay, you have to breathe.

14:10.245 --> 14:11.912
Okay, short quick breaths.

14:11.946 --> 14:13.947
Like this, watch. Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

14:13.982 --> 14:15.048
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.017
- Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.
- You look ridiculous!

14:17.051 --> 14:18.919
Well, seriously, try it.

14:18.953 --> 14:21.154
Both: Hoo, hoo, haa,
haa. Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

14:21.189 --> 14:22.189
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

14:22.223 --> 14:23.257
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

14:23.291 --> 14:24.958
- Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.
- Good.

14:24.993 --> 14:26.293
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.
How'd you know about that?

14:26.327 --> 14:28.161
How do you think? I was with Regina

14:28.196 --> 14:29.263
when you were born.

14:29.297 --> 14:30.998
(Sighs)

14:31.065 --> 14:32.933
This is the most natural
thing in the world.

14:32.967 --> 14:34.234
Maybe for her. She's got two daughters.

14:34.269 --> 14:35.869
She only had to push one out.

14:35.904 --> 14:37.971
Hoo, hoo. I can't believe I'm having twins.

14:38.006 --> 14:40.908
- Haa, hoo, hoo, haa, haa.
- Breathe.

14:40.975 --> 14:43.210
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa. Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

14:43.244 --> 14:44.912
I still remember when
they put you in my arms

14:44.946 --> 14:47.014
for the first time.

14:47.048 --> 14:49.182
_

14:50.215 --> 14:51.170
_

14:51.871 --> 14:52.623
_

14:54.030 --> 14:55.885
_

14:59.700 --> 15:02.290
_

15:05.389 --> 15:06.658
_

15:10.171 --> 15:12.306
What is it?

15:12.340 --> 15:14.942
Were you scared?

15:14.976 --> 15:16.310
Of course.

15:22.283 --> 15:24.017
And when I look into your eyes,

15:24.052 --> 15:25.986
I knew.

15:26.020 --> 15:29.189
As long as I lived all my success,

15:29.223 --> 15:31.325
all my failures...

15:36.898 --> 15:38.332
I would never do anything

15:38.366 --> 15:40.200
more important than this.

15:43.137 --> 15:45.138
Here comes another one! (Screaming)

15:45.173 --> 15:46.239
Okay, you're gonna be fine!

15:46.274 --> 15:48.141
- Just breathe! Breathe.
- Hoo, hoo...

15:48.176 --> 15:50.043
Haa, haa. Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

15:50.078 --> 15:52.946
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa. Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

15:52.981 --> 15:54.081
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

15:54.115 --> 15:55.349
(Pants)

15:55.383 --> 15:57.217
Thanks for being here, dad.

15:57.251 --> 16:00.187
Hoo, hoo, haa, haa. Hoo, hoo, haa, haa.

16:00.221 --> 16:01.254
<i>(Door opens)</i>

16:01.289 --> 16:03.890
Here's the proud papa.

16:03.925 --> 16:05.192
(Pants)

16:16.971 --> 16:18.205
You're here.

16:28.216 --> 16:30.217
When's the last time you took vitals?

16:30.251 --> 16:31.918
<i>Nurse: It was 1:00 P.M.</i>

16:34.322 --> 16:36.123
Bay.

16:36.157 --> 16:37.991
How is he?

16:38.026 --> 16:40.927
They won't tell us anything.

16:40.962 --> 16:43.897
What happened? He was stable when I left.

16:43.931 --> 16:46.967
I was just sitting there talking to him.

16:47.001 --> 16:48.268
He even squeezed my hand.

16:48.302 --> 16:50.871
And then the next thing I know,

16:50.938 --> 16:53.306
alarms are going off and
nurses start running in.

16:53.341 --> 16:55.308
I'm so sorry.

16:55.343 --> 16:57.277
I should have never left.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.192
_

17:00.314 --> 17:02.215
I was taking the S.A.T.

17:02.250 --> 17:07.287
- Whoa.
- Angelo's in the hospital

17:07.320 --> 17:10.223
and you were off taking some stupid test?

17:11.325 --> 17:12.959
I don't understand

17:12.993 --> 17:14.227
<i>how you could just leave</i>

17:14.262 --> 17:15.896
<i>in the middle of everything!</i>

17:15.930 --> 17:20.099
He needs us right now! Both of us...

17:20.134 --> 17:21.835
Daphne, what's wrong?

17:26.941 --> 17:27.907
Could you read his lips?

17:29.110 --> 17:32.245
Did he say something about Angelo?

17:32.280 --> 17:34.114
Wh...

17:36.951 --> 17:39.052
what did he say?

17:39.087 --> 17:40.187
Daphne, tell me!

17:41.222 --> 17:42.255
Angelo...

17:42.290 --> 17:44.191
"Angelo" what?

17:46.094 --> 17:47.327
He's brain dead.

18:07.105 --> 18:09.773
The second hemorrhage was very severe.

18:09.807 --> 18:12.642
Based on changes in his
clinical presentation,

18:12.677 --> 18:14.911
I'm afraid this is not
a recoverable injury.

18:14.946 --> 18:17.080
But he's in the hospital.

18:17.115 --> 18:20.083
You were watching him. He was stable.

18:20.118 --> 18:21.952
There was no way to predict this.

18:21.986 --> 18:24.788
Wait, I... I don't understand.

18:24.822 --> 18:27.057
Your husband's brain has lost all function.

18:27.091 --> 18:28.892
<i>It can no longer communicate</i>

18:28.926 --> 18:31.761
<i>- with the rest of his body.
- He's saying he's gone.</i>

18:31.796 --> 18:33.697
Brain death...

18:33.731 --> 18:34.798
is death.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.968
- (Sighs)
- I'm very sorry.

18:38.002 --> 18:39.703
No, this doesn't make any sense.

18:39.737 --> 18:42.806
If he's breathing, then he is still alive.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.107
The ventilator is breathing for him.

18:44.142 --> 18:45.942
<i>It's keeping his heart beating</i>

18:45.977 --> 18:47.711
<i>and his blood oxygenated,</i>

18:47.745 --> 18:49.012
but without brain function,

18:49.046 --> 18:50.981
his heart will eventually stop on it's own.

18:51.015 --> 18:53.116
Okay, Doctor, wait a second.

18:53.151 --> 18:55.785
There's got to be something
else that we can do.

18:55.820 --> 18:57.721
The most humane thing you can do

18:57.755 --> 18:59.689
is to remove him from the ventilator.

18:59.724 --> 19:01.925
So you want us to kill him?

19:01.959 --> 19:04.127
Do the dirty work for you?

19:04.162 --> 19:05.695
Again...

19:06.797 --> 19:08.665
I am sorry for your loss.

19:16.908 --> 19:19.676
Dr. Larkin, please wait.

19:21.112 --> 19:24.047
- How could this happen?
- Unfortunately,

19:24.081 --> 19:26.082
there's a lot about the
brain we don't understand.

19:26.117 --> 19:28.652
But he was hooked up to all those machines.

19:28.686 --> 19:29.786
Couldn't you see this coming?

19:29.820 --> 19:32.022
Medicine is an imperfect science.

19:32.056 --> 19:34.824
But his life can't just be over.

19:34.859 --> 19:36.893
In cases like your fathers,

19:36.928 --> 19:39.062
there's the option of organ donation.

19:43.801 --> 19:44.935
Organ donation?

19:44.969 --> 19:46.670
It won't bring him back,

19:46.704 --> 19:50.674
but it may offer some kind
of consolation to your family

19:50.708 --> 19:52.909
in knowing that a part of him lives on.

19:52.944 --> 19:55.111
Think about it.

20:12.096 --> 20:13.997
I got some things for Regina.

20:14.031 --> 20:15.732
Any luck?

20:15.766 --> 20:16.700
I talked to four neurosurgeons.

20:16.744 --> 20:18.612
They're all giving me the same line...

20:18.646 --> 20:20.581
"brain dead is dead."

20:21.649 --> 20:23.317
So what do we do now?

20:23.351 --> 20:24.685
Well, I'm waiting on a
call from Walt Wrobel.

20:24.719 --> 20:26.553
Remember him? He's the
old Royals' team doctor.

20:26.588 --> 20:27.788
He's up at the Mayo now.

20:27.822 --> 20:30.324
And I thought maybe, you
know, I'd call in an old favor,

20:30.358 --> 20:31.725
have Angelo transferred up there.

20:31.759 --> 20:34.528
Honey, that's just not realistic.

20:34.562 --> 20:35.662
What are you talk... Kathryn, I'm trying

20:35.697 --> 20:37.464
everything that I can think of.

20:37.498 --> 20:38.599
What else do you want me to do?

20:38.633 --> 20:39.766
I think we're just gonna
have to start accepting

20:39.801 --> 20:41.468
that all these doctors are right.

20:41.502 --> 20:42.803
What are you talking about? That is crazy.

20:42.837 --> 20:44.404
I'm not gonna quit on him.

20:44.439 --> 20:45.539
- John...
- What if that was me

20:45.573 --> 20:47.407
- lying in that bed?!
- I don't know.

20:47.442 --> 20:48.809
But if every single doctor
told me you were gone,

20:48.843 --> 20:50.344
I'd have to let you go.

20:50.378 --> 20:52.613
I mean, why are you acting like this?

20:52.647 --> 20:54.648
- (Sighs)
- Sorry, it's just...

20:56.484 --> 20:58.285
Angelo came to me the other day...

20:59.354 --> 21:00.420
Said the restaurant was going under.

21:00.455 --> 21:01.521
He wanted a loan.

21:03.391 --> 21:04.458
A loan?

21:04.492 --> 21:06.593
What happened to all the
money from the lawsuit?

21:06.628 --> 21:08.495
That's what I said. It's gone.

21:08.529 --> 21:11.665
$5,000,000? What happened?

21:11.699 --> 21:14.534
You don't think that that car accident...

21:14.569 --> 21:16.770
that... that he would...

21:16.804 --> 21:19.406
(Sighs)

21:19.440 --> 21:22.476
Angelo? What? No, way.

21:22.543 --> 21:25.612
Well, money makes people
do very strange things.

21:25.647 --> 21:28.582
Honey, I am telling you,
Angelo is not that guy.

21:28.616 --> 21:30.717
Yeah, well...

21:33.821 --> 21:36.356
when he came to me for the loan,

21:36.391 --> 21:38.659
I said no.

21:38.693 --> 21:41.328
Can't do it. Money's tied up,

21:41.362 --> 21:42.496
can't liquidate.

21:46.467 --> 21:47.768
But the truth is...

21:49.504 --> 21:53.440
when he told me he was broke...

21:53.474 --> 21:55.676
I thought to myself,

21:55.710 --> 21:57.377
"yeah.

21:58.579 --> 22:00.580
You deserve it."

22:04.719 --> 22:06.586
(Scoffs)

22:08.756 --> 22:11.558
What the hell is the matter with me?

22:13.761 --> 22:15.495
You're human.

22:21.336 --> 22:22.436
(Exhales)

22:22.470 --> 22:24.304
(Groans)

22:30.678 --> 22:33.313
<i>Bay: I don't care what the doctor says.</i>

22:33.348 --> 22:34.581
His heart's still beating.

22:34.615 --> 22:37.384
He looks exactly like he did before.

22:39.387 --> 22:41.755
The machines are keeping him alive.

22:41.789 --> 22:43.557
At some point,

22:43.591 --> 22:45.392
we're gonna have to let him go.

22:47.462 --> 22:50.364
What? (Scoffs)

22:51.833 --> 22:53.767
What are you talking about?

22:53.801 --> 22:58.705
Dr. Larkin said that he
can't come back from this.

22:58.740 --> 23:00.540
So you're ready to just pull the plug?

23:01.743 --> 23:04.544
We're not Angelo's only family, you know.

23:04.579 --> 23:07.314
We haven't even talked to his mother yet.

23:07.348 --> 23:08.482
You're right.

23:08.516 --> 23:09.750
Of course, we should call her.

23:09.784 --> 23:11.651
And, um...

23:14.455 --> 23:17.357
Dr. Larkin suggested

23:17.392 --> 23:20.660
that we should consider organ donation.

23:20.695 --> 23:24.331
You want to strip Angelo for parts

23:24.365 --> 23:25.699
like he's some kind of used car?

23:25.733 --> 23:28.735
- No, it's not like that.
- Right, sure.

23:28.770 --> 23:30.537
Then you can go back to taking the S.A.T.

23:30.571 --> 23:32.472
and all will be right with the world.

23:32.507 --> 23:34.307
The world will never be right.

23:34.375 --> 23:38.745
But if Angelo could
save some other lives...

23:40.681 --> 23:42.582
I think that's what he would want.

23:42.617 --> 23:46.620
What the hell do you know
about what he would want?!

23:46.654 --> 23:48.588
<i>You don't know anything about him!</i>

23:48.623 --> 23:50.457
He's not even your dad!

24:15.258 --> 24:17.675
_

24:18.066 --> 24:20.968
Uh, I don't know.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.938
His phone was broken in the accident,

24:23.972 --> 24:27.007
but he has to have his mother's number

24:27.042 --> 24:28.943
written down somewhere.

24:28.977 --> 24:32.279
Maybe an address book or a laptop.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.551
_

24:35.552 --> 24:37.200
_

24:37.201 --> 24:41.140
_

24:41.145 --> 24:42.156
She's his mother.

24:42.190 --> 24:44.358
She's gonna want to keep
him alive as much as I do.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.768
_

24:47.769 --> 24:49.063
You sound just like Daphne.

24:50.232 --> 24:52.099
Whose side are you on?

24:52.100 --> 24:54.057
_

24:54.060 --> 24:56.270
As long as Angelo is breathing

24:56.304 --> 24:58.105
there's still hope.

24:58.140 --> 25:00.141
So are you gonna help me or not?

25:31.339 --> 25:32.973
Be still my heart.

25:34.009 --> 25:35.376
Is this really happening?

25:37.379 --> 25:40.214
You're gonna be the most beautiful bride

25:40.248 --> 25:41.949
to ever walk down the aisle.

25:44.352 --> 25:47.321
How will I know I'm
making the right decision?

25:47.355 --> 25:50.124
You can't know anything for sure.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.961
Being a doctor must
have taught you that, no?

25:53.995 --> 25:56.230
It's like how you call medicine?

25:56.264 --> 25:58.065
An imperfect science.

25:58.099 --> 25:59.200
<i>Exactement.</i>

26:00.302 --> 26:02.236
Love is the same.

26:03.905 --> 26:05.306
You cannot see it,

26:05.340 --> 26:08.242
touch it, measure it.

26:08.276 --> 26:12.146
Only you can know how he makes you feel.

26:12.180 --> 26:14.882
Does he make you smile, laugh?

26:16.284 --> 26:20.221
Makes you feel like the most
amazing woman in the world?

26:23.959 --> 26:25.893
Then you made the right decision.

26:26.995 --> 26:28.329
(Sighs)

26:28.363 --> 26:31.131
Thanks.

26:31.166 --> 26:33.100
I needed that.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.102
<i>Anytime, mon trésor.</i>

26:37.272 --> 26:39.206
I feel like the luckiest girl

26:39.241 --> 26:42.243
to have two dads walk her down the aisle.

26:44.212 --> 26:47.014
I wouldn't have missed it...

26:48.083 --> 26:49.216
For the world.

27:25.387 --> 27:28.889
Q, R, S...

27:28.924 --> 27:30.057

27:51.012 --> 27:52.212
just tried to give me a recommendation

27:52.247 --> 27:54.214
for a funeral home.

27:54.249 --> 27:56.850
I want to move Angelo to another hospital.

27:56.885 --> 27:58.185
Have you talked to anyone?

27:58.219 --> 28:00.321
Yes, we've called all over.

28:00.355 --> 28:02.222
Everyone says Dr. Larkin is one of the best

28:02.257 --> 28:03.991
neurosurgeons in the country,

28:04.025 --> 28:06.927
and they all agree with his opinion.

28:08.063 --> 28:10.230
Exactly, his "opinion."

28:10.265 --> 28:13.033
Regina, we could not have
done better for Angelo.

28:14.169 --> 28:16.103
(Scoffs) That's it?

28:16.137 --> 28:17.171
You're giving up?!

28:17.205 --> 28:20.040
Why am I surprised?

28:20.075 --> 28:21.275
You never liked Angelo,

28:21.309 --> 28:23.978
never gave him a chance.

28:24.012 --> 28:25.045
Please, Regina.

28:25.080 --> 28:27.214
Ever since he came into our lives,

28:27.248 --> 28:29.249
you have treated him like a joke!

28:29.284 --> 28:31.352
You resented having to
share the girls with him.

28:31.386 --> 28:34.355
And now you get to be their only father!

28:34.389 --> 28:36.223
Well, congratulations!

28:36.257 --> 28:38.058
This is working out great for you!

28:50.046 --> 28:51.714
We shouldn't be looking at this.

28:53.740 --> 28:59.456

28:59.957 --> 29:01.750

29:01.858 --> 29:04.994

expectation of my recovery

29:05.028 --> 29:06.862

29:06.897 --> 29:09.632
will only serve to postpone
the moment of my death,

I direct that support to...

29:21.713 --> 29:23.375
_

29:23.383 --> 29:24.747
No, we don't.

29:24.781 --> 29:26.882
We will put this back where we found it.

29:26.917 --> 29:28.684
And no one ever needs to know.

29:30.055 --> 29:31.274
_

29:31.284 --> 29:32.955
Yes, we can.

29:32.989 --> 29:34.056
We pretend we were never here.

29:34.057 --> 29:35.757
_

29:35.758 --> 29:37.793
I don't give a damn what it says!

29:37.828 --> 29:38.794
Okay?!

29:46.036 --> 29:47.937
Do you know what the last

29:47.971 --> 29:51.841
real conversation I had with Angelo was?

29:53.977 --> 29:56.045
Neither do I.

29:59.850 --> 30:01.150
Those were his last words to me.

30:05.856 --> 30:07.823
I can't even remember them.

30:07.858 --> 30:10.025
He was living across the driveway.

30:10.060 --> 30:12.761
He was right there...

30:14.998 --> 30:17.032
and I ignored him.

30:19.330 --> 30:22.590
_

30:22.591 --> 30:25.063
_

30:25.064 --> 30:31.690
_

30:31.691 --> 30:35.288
_

30:55.138 --> 30:56.138
Hey.

30:56.172 --> 30:57.940
Hey.

30:59.709 --> 31:00.709
I'm sorry.

31:00.744 --> 31:02.978
No, you don't have to apologize.

31:03.013 --> 31:04.980
I shouldn't have yelled at John.

31:05.015 --> 31:07.082
Look...

31:07.117 --> 31:08.784
(Sniffles)

31:08.818 --> 31:10.085
We're family.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.755
If you can't yell at
us, who can you yell at?

31:14.858 --> 31:17.126
Last night, Angelo and I had a huge fight.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.894
Tsk.

31:18.929 --> 31:20.129
He was so mad at me.

31:20.163 --> 31:23.032
And then he got in that car.

31:23.066 --> 31:25.000
This is not your fault.

31:25.035 --> 31:27.169
I said all these horrible things.

31:27.203 --> 31:29.838
Listen to me, Regina.

31:29.873 --> 31:32.841
We don't know why his
car went off the road.

31:32.876 --> 31:35.010
You can't blame yourself.

31:46.056 --> 31:48.023
We broke up because of the switch.

31:49.826 --> 31:51.160
He thought I cheated on him.

31:52.963 --> 31:54.763
And then...

31:55.966 --> 31:57.800
when I found out the truth,

31:57.834 --> 32:01.003
I was too stubborn to tell him,

32:01.037 --> 32:02.972
too angry.

32:03.006 --> 32:04.907
(Sobbing)

32:04.941 --> 32:06.909
(Sniffles)

32:06.943 --> 32:09.745
All those years that we
could have had together.

32:11.147 --> 32:12.881
Yeah.

32:13.984 --> 32:17.853
You know, earlier when I was praying...

32:19.723 --> 32:22.791
I wasn't just praying for Angelo to live.

32:24.160 --> 32:27.096
I was praying for strength...

32:27.130 --> 32:28.931
for you.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.767
For all of us.

32:33.837 --> 32:38.807
Honey, we're gonna get
through this as a family.

32:40.744 --> 32:42.711
I promise you.

32:49.819 --> 32:52.054
Have you heard about this man in Texas?

32:52.088 --> 32:53.822
He was in a motorcycle accident,

32:53.857 --> 32:55.024
they said he was braid dead,

32:55.058 --> 32:56.659
but he woke up.

32:56.693 --> 32:57.726
I am aware.

32:57.761 --> 32:59.128
And in that case, it was doctor error.

32:59.162 --> 33:03.699
Well, with all due respect, Doctor,

33:03.733 --> 33:05.734
couldn't you have made the same mistake?

33:05.769 --> 33:07.836
Let me show you something.

33:13.076 --> 33:14.877
This is the angiogram we did

33:14.911 --> 33:17.046
after your father's first hemorrhage.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.080
You see these?

33:18.114 --> 33:20.716
They're blood vessels.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.685
And you can see the blood

33:22.719 --> 33:23.886
flowing through them.

33:23.920 --> 33:24.987
Now...

33:25.021 --> 33:27.756
This was taken

33:27.791 --> 33:29.692
after the second hemorrhage.

33:31.928 --> 33:33.829
There's no blood.

33:33.863 --> 33:37.733
I also performed a
25-point neurological exam.

33:37.767 --> 33:39.735
He failed across the board...

33:39.769 --> 33:42.771
no corneal reflex, no gag response,

33:42.806 --> 33:43.806
nothing.

33:51.781 --> 33:54.049
That's not fair.

33:54.084 --> 33:55.651
I know.

33:56.820 --> 33:59.655
Death never is.

34:09.866 --> 34:12.835
I know what Angelo would want.

34:20.009 --> 34:22.777
He never told me he had a will.

34:22.812 --> 34:24.716
He already made

34:24.947 --> 34:27.916
the hard decision for us.

34:27.951 --> 34:30.953
But I can't just give up on him.

34:30.987 --> 34:31.987
Mom...

34:46.870 --> 34:48.003
There's something else.

34:49.839 --> 34:52.040
We would like

34:52.074 --> 34:54.842
to donate his organs.

35:04.954 --> 35:06.688
(Crying)

35:12.695 --> 35:14.696
(Exhales sharply, sniffling)

35:14.731 --> 35:16.098
I guess now...

35:19.836 --> 35:21.837
we have to say goodbye.

35:31.876 --> 35:33.945
What you're doing, is a gift.

35:34.479 --> 35:38.182
Mr. Sorrento's donated organs and tissues

35:38.216 --> 35:40.284
could save as many as 50 lives.

35:40.318 --> 35:42.553
Do you know which organs

35:42.587 --> 35:44.455
he'll be able to take?

35:44.489 --> 35:46.590
We've cleared the heart,

35:46.625 --> 35:48.259
liver,

35:48.293 --> 35:50.361
pancreas, lungs,

35:50.395 --> 35:52.563
corneas, small intestines,

35:52.597 --> 35:55.299
<i>bone, bone marrow and skin tissue.</i>

35:55.333 --> 35:57.935
Wow, that's amazing.

35:57.990 --> 36:00.024
Only the kidneys are questionable

36:00.058 --> 36:01.092
because of a condition

36:01.126 --> 36:02.893
related to the brain aneurysm.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.329
- Wha... ?
- Oh.

36:05.364 --> 36:09.300
I'm sorry, um, no one said anything

36:09.334 --> 36:11.202
about a brain aneurysm.

36:11.236 --> 36:13.304
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:13.338 --> 36:15.206
<i>I thought you knew.</i>

36:15.240 --> 36:17.241
His latest C.T. scan

36:17.276 --> 36:19.310
showed evidence of a
ruptured cerebral aneurysm.

36:19.344 --> 36:24.148
So the accident caused it?

36:24.182 --> 36:27.184
No, the aneurysm was a
pre-existing condition.

36:27.219 --> 36:32.156
When it ruptured, it likely
caused him to run off the road.

36:32.190 --> 36:36.327
But... why didn't Dr. Larkin say anything?

36:37.996 --> 36:39.130
Um...

36:39.164 --> 36:41.098
<i>Woman: I see.</i>

36:41.133 --> 36:44.068
The results of the earlier C.T. scans

36:44.102 --> 36:46.337
were obscured by profuse bleeding.

36:46.371 --> 36:50.107
Do you know what caused the rupture?

36:50.142 --> 36:51.409
Typical causes

36:51.443 --> 36:53.244
<i>are high blood pressure,</i>

36:53.278 --> 36:54.979
<i>stress, anxiety,</i>

36:55.013 --> 36:56.013
anger.

36:56.048 --> 36:58.349
- Did you say "anger"?
- Mm-hmm.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.887
So if he was really angry

37:02.921 --> 37:04.088
right before the accident... ?

37:04.122 --> 37:05.890
Yes, that could have caused it.

37:05.924 --> 37:09.026
<i>Now, once the organs are harvested,</i>

37:09.061 --> 37:10.094
<i>U. N.O.S. matches them</i>

with recipients on waiting lists

37:12.230 --> 37:13.230
around the country.

37:13.265 --> 37:15.933
That means time is of the essence.

37:15.967 --> 37:17.268
If there are other relatives

37:17.302 --> 37:19.170
who would like to pay their respects...

37:20.372 --> 37:23.274
There's Angelo's mother in France.

37:23.308 --> 37:25.076
Time is of the essence.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.185
Okay.

37:35.220 --> 37:37.254
Let's go ahead.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.058
Are you sure?

37:41.093 --> 37:43.027
Honey, I could make the call.

37:43.061 --> 37:46.063
No. It should be me.
