00:06.717 --> 00:09.032
No, not you!

00:09.616 --> 00:10.943
No. No. No.

00:11.683 --> 00:11.993
Oh, please, not you.

00:15.367 --> 00:18.167
No, i'm here, and i'm
not goin' anywhere.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.667
You can't stay.

00:19.667 --> 00:21.801
You know that. You have to cross over.

00:24.133 --> 00:26.300
Jim, no!

00:28.667 --> 00:31.334
Jim, it's you... y-You're back.

00:32.234 --> 00:33.767
Do i know you?

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.534 --> 01:18.801
I know that you did
this to stay with me.

01:20.701 --> 01:22.734
I can't be mad at that.

01:22.734 --> 01:25.601
But you could have gone into the light.

01:25.601 --> 01:28.000
I would have missed you...

01:29.267 --> 01:32.767
But at least i would
have known where you are.

01:36.801 --> 01:41.000
Can you hear me inside there, jim?

01:41.000 --> 01:42.334
Please...

01:42.334 --> 01:45.234
Give me a sign if you can hear me.

02:01.234 --> 02:03.133
Hey.

02:05.367 --> 02:06.968
Hey.

02:06.968 --> 02:10.501
What the heck happened to me?

02:10.501 --> 02:12.667
It's a long story.

02:14.334 --> 02:16.534
What do you remember?

02:18.634 --> 02:20.534
I remember you.

02:21.601 --> 02:23.133
You do?

02:23.133 --> 02:24.868
Yeah.

02:24.868 --> 02:27.467
How could i not?

02:29.167 --> 02:31.968
You're here every time i wake up.

02:36.033 --> 02:39.334
And?

02:39.334 --> 02:41.133
What more is there?

02:41.133 --> 02:42.934
I mean, i barely know you,

02:42.934 --> 02:45.501
But you're here more
than anybody else i know.

02:45.501 --> 02:46.667
Or knew.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.267
He only game to grandview

02:49.267 --> 02:50.901
A few months ago for work,

02:50.901 --> 02:53.267
So he has no friends here to speak of,

02:53.267 --> 02:55.434
And his family's far
away, michigan, i think.

02:55.434 --> 02:57.267
So who does everybody think melinda is?

02:57.267 --> 02:59.601
He's an architect, so
melinda's been telling people

02:59.601 --> 03:01.634
She hired him to remodel her garage.

03:01.634 --> 03:02.801
And they bought that?

03:02.801 --> 03:05.334
Hey, as long as the guy
doesn't have any memory,

03:05.334 --> 03:07.067
Who's to say it's not true, right?

03:07.067 --> 03:09.167
You should get a few more days rest.

03:09.167 --> 03:11.033
Melinda thinks that jim's soul

03:11.033 --> 03:13.467
Just magically went into this guy?

03:13.467 --> 03:16.334
She says that when sam died,

03:16.334 --> 03:17.968
His spirit went into the light,

03:17.968 --> 03:19.868
And jim's spirit took its place somehow.

03:19.868 --> 03:21.367
Melinda says she's seen it before.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.601
It's called a step-In.

03:22.601 --> 03:25.767
When is she planning on
telling him all of this?

03:25.767 --> 03:28.400
As soon as he remembers
who she is to him.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.267
She's afraid if she tells him now,

03:30.267 --> 03:31.501
He'll think she's insane.

03:31.501 --> 03:35.501
This has got to be one
of the stages of grief,

03:35.501 --> 03:37.367
Eh, just melinda-Style, right?

03:37.367 --> 03:40.033
You wanna look through your stuff again?

03:40.033 --> 03:41.000
The doctor says that...

03:41.000 --> 03:42.901
Right. The amnesia therapy, huh?

03:42.901 --> 03:44.067
Here.

03:47.734 --> 03:50.234
Oh. How sick do you have to be

03:50.234 --> 03:52.767
To not even remember your own face, huh?

03:52.767 --> 03:53.767
You're not sick.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.400
There's no brain damage.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.200
You're just temporarily...

03:57.200 --> 03:58.868
Wait a minute. Right here it says

03:58.868 --> 04:02.334
I have an appointment with
jordan, whoever that is, tomorrow.

04:02.334 --> 04:05.934
You want me to keep
the appointment for you,

04:05.934 --> 04:07.767
Find out? Sure.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.400
Why are you so nice to me?

04:10.400 --> 04:13.701
I mean, i'm just a guy you
hired to do a job, right?

04:13.701 --> 04:16.567
But you've been here
every day since i woke up.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.767
Let's just say i knew someone like you

04:18.767 --> 04:21.601
Who was there for me once.

04:28.567 --> 04:30.400
Hey.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.634
What are you guys doing here?

04:32.634 --> 04:36.567
What, your friends can't come
and take you out for a nice meal?

04:36.567 --> 04:38.734
Oh, that's... that's nice,

04:38.734 --> 04:40.934
But i'm just gonna turn in.

04:40.934 --> 04:42.200
So rain check?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.200
Sure.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.934
Ok.

04:48.067 --> 04:50.834
How long are we gonna
pretend this is ok?

05:18.934 --> 05:20.434
Jordan?

05:21.634 --> 05:23.634
Yeah.

05:23.634 --> 05:25.767
Who are you?

05:26.834 --> 05:28.667
Hi.

05:28.667 --> 05:31.033
I'm melinda. I'm a friend of sam's.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.834
Where is he? Is he ok?

05:32.834 --> 05:35.000
Yeah. He's fine.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.234
Thank god.

05:36.234 --> 05:38.567
So worried when he didn't
come home last night.

06:17.067 --> 06:20.334
Are you... are you sam's girlfriend?

06:21.201 --> 06:22.301
No.

06:22.301 --> 06:24.568
God, no. I...

06:24.568 --> 06:25.900
I'm his sister.

06:25.900 --> 06:28.267
How do you know sam anyway?

06:28.267 --> 06:29.601
Through his work.

06:29.601 --> 06:31.934
Look, the reason that i'm here

06:31.934 --> 06:33.568
Is there was an accident.

06:33.568 --> 06:36.000
He wasn't hurt too badly, but
he's still in the hospital.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
What happened?

06:37.000 --> 06:38.100
We should go see him,

06:38.100 --> 06:40.100
Talk to the doctors, let them explain.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.634
Ok.

06:44.467 --> 06:45.733
She's staying in his apartment

06:45.733 --> 06:48.000
Until she can get one of her own

06:48.000 --> 06:48.967
And a job.

06:48.967 --> 06:50.534
He was supposed to meet her

06:50.534 --> 06:52.601
To help apply for a cellphone.

06:52.601 --> 06:55.067
I'm so glad you're all right! I'm fine.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.900
Am i a terrible person?

06:56.900 --> 06:58.401
Why?

06:58.401 --> 07:01.334
I'm relieved that he
didn't recognize her,

07:01.334 --> 07:04.534
Because if he did, he might not be jim.

07:05.867 --> 07:06.900
Might not be?

07:06.900 --> 07:08.900
Look, i see the same guy that you see,

07:08.900 --> 07:12.167
Different hair, nose,
eyes. It's not jim.

07:12.167 --> 07:14.067
But the day of the accident,

07:14.067 --> 07:16.601
I saw jim's ghost step into sam's body,

07:16.601 --> 07:19.434
And ever since then, he
hasn't appeared to me.

07:19.434 --> 07:21.067
He's gone.

07:21.067 --> 07:23.534
I just know what i see when i look

07:23.534 --> 07:25.167
In those eyes, and jim...

07:25.167 --> 07:26.767
Is in there somewhere.

07:26.767 --> 07:28.201
Do you need anything
before i go? I'm all right.

07:28.201 --> 07:30.167
He just has to be.

07:33.034 --> 07:36.767
Paging dr. Becker, paging dr. Becker.

07:39.134 --> 07:41.767
He doesn't remember me.

07:42.668 --> 07:45.434
Not my name, not my face.

07:45.434 --> 07:48.267
It's one stupid thing, he...

07:48.267 --> 07:51.100
He remembers the smell of my shampoo.

07:51.100 --> 07:54.334
He remembers your shampoo?

07:54.334 --> 07:57.201
It's the same almond-Scented
stuff i've always used.

07:57.201 --> 08:01.967
He used to tease me
about it relentlessly.

08:01.967 --> 08:02.934
Really?

08:02.934 --> 08:04.833
How long do you think it'll take

08:04.833 --> 08:06.700
Before he remembers the rest?

08:06.700 --> 08:08.767
Never! That's when.

08:11.234 --> 08:12.267
What?

08:12.267 --> 08:14.767
Nothing. Sure it's nothing at all.

08:19.434 --> 08:21.000
Hey, can you get me that box,

08:21.000 --> 08:23.301
The one that says "sports"?

08:27.167 --> 08:28.767
You ok?

08:28.767 --> 08:31.167
Yeah. Sure.

08:33.601 --> 08:35.832
How's the guy doin',

08:35.832 --> 08:37.501
The one in the hospital?

08:37.501 --> 08:40.301
He died in an accident.

08:40.301 --> 08:43.433
Then he...

08:43.433 --> 08:47.134
Was revived when jim's
spirit stepped into his body.

08:47.134 --> 08:49.100
His name was sam.

08:49.100 --> 08:51.634
Is... is sam.

08:52.501 --> 08:54.201
Is he remembering stuff yet?

08:54.201 --> 08:55.867
I don't know. I...

08:55.867 --> 08:58.201
He seems to remember me a little,

08:58.201 --> 09:00.067
But then there's other times...

09:01.634 --> 09:03.034
What?

09:04.367 --> 09:06.000
Well, all of a sudden,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.401
He likes different foods

09:07.401 --> 09:09.401
Than jim used to, and he can remember

09:09.401 --> 09:11.100
The smell of his sister's shampoo.

09:11.100 --> 09:13.401
Eli says that it's
like a physical thing,

09:13.401 --> 09:15.134
Like some sort of muscle memory,

09:15.134 --> 09:17.367
But if it is jim,

09:17.367 --> 09:19.100
How does he recognize sam...

09:21.767 --> 09:22.934
What?

09:24.934 --> 09:27.034
You don't have to stop on my account.

09:27.034 --> 09:30.134
You know, actually you
guys have done so much,

09:30.134 --> 09:32.334
I think i'm good here, so...

09:55.733 --> 09:58.067
I didn't know you had practice today.

09:58.067 --> 10:01.700
I thought your shooting
clinic was on mondays.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.034
It's jim's.

10:03.034 --> 10:06.434
Do you think it's ok if i
take it instead of donating it?

10:06.434 --> 10:08.201
Yeah.

10:08.201 --> 10:09.668
Of course, honey.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.234
I know you miss him, ned.

10:17.234 --> 10:20.301
Melinda told me that you
would play pickup games

10:20.301 --> 10:22.167
With jim practically every weekend.

10:24.601 --> 10:28.134
I know we're lucky to
have each other, mom...

10:28.134 --> 10:30.100
But sometimes...

10:31.267 --> 10:33.634
Jim was like a dad to you.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.700
I know.

10:37.134 --> 10:38.733
I want you to know

10:38.733 --> 10:42.800
That i was happy that you
felt that way about him.

10:45.634 --> 10:48.134
It's ok to be sad, ned.

10:48.134 --> 10:49.501
We all are.

10:50.467 --> 10:52.434
I know.

10:52.434 --> 10:56.967
We just all deal with
it in different ways.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.034
Yeah.

11:14.634 --> 11:16.601
Who are you?

11:16.601 --> 11:18.301
What do you want?

11:19.467 --> 11:21.401
You were at the hospital.

11:21.401 --> 11:23.267
You've been following me.

11:23.267 --> 11:26.634
Just tell me what you
want, or i can't help you.

11:26.634 --> 11:29.301
The two of you, you're both thieves.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.134
But you won't get to
keep what you've stolen.

11:33.134 --> 11:34.634
What have i stolen?

11:34.634 --> 11:36.134
You know perfectly well.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.733
Where did sam go?

11:42.733 --> 11:43.867
He was checked out last night.

11:43.867 --> 11:45.067
By who?

11:45.067 --> 11:46.733
I don't know. Maybe if you ask...

11:51.534 --> 11:52.833
Yes?

11:52.833 --> 11:56.467
Hi. My name is melinda
gordon. I'm a friend of sam's.

11:56.467 --> 11:58.767
A client, actually, and
i went to the hospital,

11:58.767 --> 12:01.367
And they told me that
he was on his way...

12:01.367 --> 12:02.367
Home. That's right.

12:02.367 --> 12:05.067
I'm nancy lucas, sam's mother,

12:05.067 --> 12:08.000
And this is my husband gerald.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.668
Mom and dad.

12:09.668 --> 12:11.601
W-Well, that... that's great

12:11.601 --> 12:13.900
That they... that
they finally found you.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.934
It was so kind of you to look after
sam while he was in the hospital,

12:16.934 --> 12:18.934
But you don't have to be
concerned about him now.

12:18.934 --> 12:21.167
His family's here, and we're
gonna be taking him home.

12:22.767 --> 12:24.634
Isn't this his home?

12:24.634 --> 12:28.134
Well, sam doesn't even
know his own mother,

12:28.134 --> 12:30.534
But luckily his mother knows him.

12:30.534 --> 12:33.534
He'll be coming home with us
until he can find himself again.

12:35.301 --> 12:36.434
With you?

12:36.434 --> 12:38.568
Mmm. You're gonna have
to find somebody else

12:38.568 --> 12:39.967
To do your blueprints, i'm afraid.

12:39.967 --> 12:42.267
He won't be much help
to you 800 miles away.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.634
Now, if you'll excuse us.

12:53.434 --> 12:55.000
The ghost seemed pretty
bent out of shape.

12:55.000 --> 12:56.568
He kept calling us thieves and saying

12:56.568 --> 12:58.634
That we would never get
to keep what we've stolen.

12:58.634 --> 13:00.733
Hey, was the ghost a
guy in his late thirties,

13:00.733 --> 13:01.767
Kind of a high forehead?

13:01.767 --> 13:03.134
Sounds like him. Why?

13:05.267 --> 13:06.234
Alan walters...

13:06.234 --> 13:08.201
The driver who caused the accident,

13:08.201 --> 13:09.467
Died on the scene.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.467
So i'm not crazy. That's good news.

13:11.467 --> 13:12.634
Good news? The guy kind of died.

13:12.634 --> 13:13.934
No, it's not good news that he's dead,

13:13.934 --> 13:15.134
But that he was a witness.

13:15.134 --> 13:16.900
To the accident? To
what happened afterwards.

13:16.900 --> 13:18.733
If he was there, he saw what jim did.

13:18.733 --> 13:20.000
That's why he's calling us thieves,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.634
'Cause he saw jim go into sam's body.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.634
So good news that you are thieves.

13:23.634 --> 13:25.967
No. Sam went into the
light. That i'm sure of,

13:25.967 --> 13:28.100
But this alan guy, he
must not have noticed.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.601
Why didn't you notice him?

13:29.601 --> 13:31.000
I was a little distracted.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.634
The important thing is is that
the reason he's haunting me

13:33.634 --> 13:35.401
Is because he knows that jim did.

13:35.401 --> 13:37.634
Melinda, i've been in some
very strange bookstores,

13:37.634 --> 13:39.800
Which is why my clothes
stink of patchouli,

13:39.800 --> 13:42.267
And read some very interesting things
on this whole step-In phenomenon.

13:42.267 --> 13:44.601
First of all, it tends to be permanent.

13:44.601 --> 13:45.934
And second?

13:45.934 --> 13:47.134
Supposedly it's like reincarnation.

13:47.134 --> 13:48.201
No. Reincarnation happens at birth.

13:48.201 --> 13:49.301
I've already dealt with that.

13:49.301 --> 13:50.434
Of course you have,

13:50.434 --> 13:52.767
But the book says that in both cases,

13:52.767 --> 13:54.967
Memories of past lives are usually lost.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.467
You gotta wonder how
much of the jim you know

13:58.467 --> 14:00.467
Is in the sam that you don't.

14:03.134 --> 14:04.900
If you take him home, the first thing

14:04.900 --> 14:06.800
He's gonna do is remember
how much he hates you.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.601
The doctors said he should
be in familiar surroundings

14:08.601 --> 14:09.833
To help him remember who he is.

14:09.833 --> 14:11.334
You mean who you want him to be.

14:11.334 --> 14:12.634
You're just upset because he can't

14:12.634 --> 14:14.401
Remember he promised to
let you freeload off of him.

14:14.401 --> 14:15.833
At least he offered to take me in,

14:15.833 --> 14:17.967
Unlike you two, who just kicked me out.

14:17.967 --> 14:19.501
We did not kick you out.

14:19.501 --> 14:21.733
We told you that if you
dropped out of college,

14:21.733 --> 14:22.800
You'd have to pay rent.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.401
If you wanted to
continue living at home.

14:24.401 --> 14:25.800
Oh, i'm not sure
"wanted" is a good word.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.401
It's not like i had a
whole lot of options.

14:27.401 --> 14:28.700
You make your own options.

14:28.700 --> 14:30.568
What are you, a fortune cookie?

14:34.767 --> 14:36.301
I remember something.

14:36.301 --> 14:39.134
Oh, sam, that's wonderful.

14:40.201 --> 14:42.401
You see? Having us
around is helping already.

14:42.401 --> 14:44.501
What is it, dear?

14:44.501 --> 14:46.534
Coffee.

14:46.534 --> 14:47.700
Anybody make any?

14:50.668 --> 14:54.034
We were just, talking about
fixing up your old room.

14:55.367 --> 14:56.700
How old am i?

14:56.700 --> 14:58.367
Look at you guys.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.100
This is like a dream
come true for you...

15:00.100 --> 15:01.668
A chance to control him all over again.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.867
That's enough, jordan.

15:02.867 --> 15:05.501
Look, maybe i-I'll take
a shower first and then...

15:05.501 --> 15:07.568
Sure, and then we'll have some coffee,

15:07.568 --> 15:09.267
And we'll talk about your future.

15:09.267 --> 15:11.767
Right. Something to look forward to.

15:36.733 --> 15:38.668
Puttin' together a memory book?

15:38.668 --> 15:41.568
Yeah, kind of.

15:41.568 --> 15:43.501
Is it for you...

15:43.501 --> 15:44.934
Or for him?

15:44.934 --> 15:46.267
Both, i guess.

15:46.267 --> 15:49.367
I... i was kind of
hoping that maybe jim...

15:49.367 --> 15:52.601
Sam would see it and
it would jog something.

15:54.434 --> 15:56.501
I know you think i'm out of my mind,

15:56.501 --> 15:57.601
But i'm not.

15:57.601 --> 15:59.668
No, i didn't suggest for one...

15:59.668 --> 16:01.167
Hi.

16:01.167 --> 16:03.100
Excuse me. I'm sorry i came,

16:03.100 --> 16:06.267
Straight to your store, but the
hospital gave me your address.

16:06.267 --> 16:08.267
No, it's fine, really.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.634
Good. Because i'm...

16:10.634 --> 16:12.434
Wait a minute.

16:12.434 --> 16:13.568
I know you.

16:13.568 --> 16:15.267
You do? Really?

16:15.267 --> 16:16.967
No. You came to the
hospital, didn't you?

16:16.967 --> 16:20.134
Yes, but i don't think we actually met.

16:20.134 --> 16:21.434
I'm... i'm delia.

16:21.434 --> 16:23.534
I'm sam. Hi.

16:23.534 --> 16:25.234
Well, so they tell me.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.301
Look, i don't know much
about brain functions,

16:28.301 --> 16:29.833
But i know i'm not
gonna get my memory back

16:29.833 --> 16:33.434
Unless i relax, and right
now, my family is imploding,

16:33.434 --> 16:35.034
And you're the only person i know

16:35.034 --> 16:38.034
Who's not desperate for me to remember
them, so are you busy right now?

16:41.733 --> 16:43.700
Not... not really.

16:43.700 --> 16:46.800
I went to the deli and
got a couple sandwiches.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.167
You wanna go somewhere?

16:49.401 --> 16:51.034
I got it covered.

16:51.034 --> 16:52.267
Thanks.

16:59.833 --> 17:02.000
Why stop at one?

17:02.000 --> 17:05.934
I mean, we could... we could
have a whole house full of kids.

17:05.934 --> 17:08.134
It would be fun raising them, i think.

17:08.134 --> 17:09.900
It'd be even more fun making them.

17:10.867 --> 17:14.300
Don't... don't press your luck.

17:20.201 --> 17:22.166
Well, it's like on the one hand,

17:22.166 --> 17:24.867
Sure, i'd like to
remember who the hell i am,

17:24.867 --> 17:28.166
But on the other, i don't remember
what it's like to remember,

17:28.166 --> 17:30.568
So i don't feel like i'm missin' much.

17:32.434 --> 17:34.034
I lost you, didn't i?

17:34.034 --> 17:36.267
No.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.034
No, sorry. I... i was just...

17:38.034 --> 17:39.267
Thinking about something.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.267
A memory, huh? Showoff.

17:44.434 --> 17:48.434
Does anything look familiar to you?

17:49.634 --> 17:51.534
I'm afraid not.

17:53.568 --> 17:56.467
But honestly, after the way
my family was goin' at it,

17:56.467 --> 17:58.201
Amnesia is my new best friend.

17:58.201 --> 17:59.967
What do you mean?

17:59.967 --> 18:02.900
I mean that from the
looks of it, my old life,

18:02.900 --> 18:04.434
Maybe it's good riddance, you know?

18:04.434 --> 18:07.167
Maybe it's better i let
it go and start over again.

18:07.167 --> 18:10.501
Yeah, or maybe your old life
wasn't as bad as it seems.

18:10.501 --> 18:13.067
You know somethin' about it i don't?

18:14.267 --> 18:15.800
Look, the truth is

18:15.800 --> 18:17.934
I actually feel at peace right now.

18:17.934 --> 18:20.401
I mean, i know i had
problems in my old life,

18:20.401 --> 18:21.733
But suddenly, fwoof, they're all gone.

18:21.733 --> 18:23.800
Is it wrong not to want them back?

18:23.800 --> 18:26.501
I... i think you should...

18:26.501 --> 18:28.967
Do whatever feels right.

18:28.967 --> 18:30.334
Trust your instincts.

18:30.334 --> 18:31.867
Yeah.

18:31.867 --> 18:35.733
I still have no idea
why you're so nice to me.

18:36.900 --> 18:40.934
I know. I must have done a
spectacular job on that garage.

18:42.100 --> 18:43.134
Yeah. Heh.

18:43.134 --> 18:45.833
Wait a minute. Could you do that again?

18:45.833 --> 18:47.668
Could you just laugh, 'cause...

18:47.668 --> 18:48.900
That sounded familiar.

18:52.401 --> 18:55.301
What do you say i conk you on the head,

18:55.301 --> 18:57.301
And then you can forget
your worries, too?

18:57.301 --> 19:00.634
'Cause then we could just
sit here and enjoy this...

19:00.634 --> 19:02.568
Glorious, oblivious afternoon together.

19:03.434 --> 19:04.934
Yeah.

19:04.934 --> 19:07.434
That sounds good.

19:07.434 --> 19:09.867
Really good.

19:35.467 --> 19:38.501
How do you like seeing
a stranger in the mirror?

19:38.501 --> 19:40.700
I know who you are, alan.

19:40.700 --> 19:43.267
I know about your wife and your son.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.767
I'm sure they'd like to hear from you.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.234
I can help you. It's what i do.

19:46.234 --> 19:48.767
Same way you helped when
your husband stole sam's body?

19:48.767 --> 19:50.301
Jim didn't steal anything.

19:50.301 --> 19:52.767
He stole that family's
chance to mourn their son.

19:52.767 --> 19:56.301
Thanks to your jim, they will
never believe that sam is dead.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.134
Right after the accident,
i saw the light, too.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.833
I watched sam go into it,

20:02.833 --> 20:04.201
Almost followed him.

20:04.201 --> 20:05.934
Why didn't you?

20:05.934 --> 20:08.833
'Cause that accident that
we had, it was my fault.

20:08.833 --> 20:11.267
I didn't deserve to go
into the light, not yet.

20:11.267 --> 20:14.668
When i saw your husband
take over sam's body,

20:14.668 --> 20:16.100
I knew what my purpose was.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.601
I saw how i had to
make things right. How?

20:18.601 --> 20:21.201
By making sure they know the truth.

20:21.201 --> 20:22.534
Who, his family?

20:22.534 --> 20:23.501
All of them.

20:23.501 --> 20:25.134
They need to know what you did

20:25.134 --> 20:26.434
So they all can move on.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.034
What if i think they're
better off not knowing?

20:28.900 --> 20:31.867
Then you are lying to yourself, too!

20:31.867 --> 20:33.800
And i will make sure they know the truth

20:33.800 --> 20:37.100
If i have to stay here the
rest of your miserable life.

20:46.934 --> 20:49.268
Hey. Sorry. I was about to knock.

20:49.268 --> 20:52.467
No. No, i... it's... i'm
sorry. It's just i'm...

20:52.467 --> 20:54.500
Little jumpy. It's ok. What happened?

20:54.500 --> 20:58.134
A tree branch broke my bedroom window.

20:58.967 --> 21:02.001
Hey, l-Let me.

21:02.001 --> 21:03.034
All right.

21:03.034 --> 21:04.867
Recycling, right? Ok.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.067
Thank you.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.567
I think i remember how to
replace a pane of glass.

21:10.567 --> 21:13.167
That's ok. You don't have to do that.

21:13.167 --> 21:14.533
Well, i gotta do something.

21:14.533 --> 21:17.867
I mean, everybody tells me
to get back to my old routine.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.667
I went back to work this morning.

21:19.667 --> 21:23.201
You can imagine how much i
remember about architecture

21:23.201 --> 21:24.901
And then subtract a lot.

21:24.901 --> 21:25.867
Sorry.

21:25.867 --> 21:26.901
Maybe my parents were right.

21:26.901 --> 21:28.667
Maybe i should go back with them.

21:28.667 --> 21:31.001
At least i'd have a roof over my head.

21:31.001 --> 21:32.101
Wh-What about your apartment?

21:32.101 --> 21:33.301
Ah. The lease is up,

21:33.301 --> 21:34.834
And they want a 6-Month renewal.

21:34.834 --> 21:37.667
No income, no job...

21:37.667 --> 21:40.500
There's not a whole lot keepin' me here.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.001
You know, if...

21:44.001 --> 21:47.034
If you remember how to fix glass...

21:47.034 --> 21:48.867
What about carpentry?

21:48.867 --> 21:51.567
Measure twice, cut one. Sure.

21:52.433 --> 21:53.700
It's not much, but maybe

21:53.700 --> 21:55.700
You could help me finish my garage.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.500
Well, that's very generous,

21:59.500 --> 22:01.667
But i don't think it'll cover my rent.

22:01.667 --> 22:02.767
There's plumbing and a fridge,

22:02.767 --> 22:05.067
And you could live there
while you do the work.

22:05.067 --> 22:06.700
You know, just until you...

22:06.700 --> 22:08.600
Figure out your next move.

22:10.967 --> 22:12.800
Heh. Well...

22:12.800 --> 22:15.667
Maybe i found something to keep me here.

22:19.433 --> 22:23.034
Sorry i'm late. I just had to
go over some things with sam.

22:23.034 --> 22:24.667
He's decided to stay in town.

22:24.667 --> 22:27.334
Oh, really? Wh-What's he gonna do?

22:27.334 --> 22:28.567
You know, this, that,

22:28.567 --> 22:30.634
Just until he gets back on his feet.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.901
So that's great, but...

22:32.901 --> 22:35.800
Why are you trying to keep our son here?

22:35.800 --> 22:39.034
Because i wanna help,
and because he's...

22:39.034 --> 22:40.567
He's not your responsibility.
We're his parents.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.734
You have no right to
tell him what to do.

22:42.734 --> 22:45.268
I didn't. I just made him an offer.

22:45.268 --> 22:46.967
To be your live-In handyman?

22:48.268 --> 22:51.234
That's... you know what? I
understand how hard this is.

22:51.234 --> 22:53.167
Don't stand there and
tell us you understand

22:53.167 --> 22:54.167
When you can't possibly.

22:54.167 --> 22:55.834
He needs to be in familiar surroundings

22:55.834 --> 22:57.734
With people who'll
love him and embrace him

22:57.734 --> 22:59.934
No matter how much of
his memory he recovers.

22:59.934 --> 23:02.800
I want the same thing
for him that you do.

23:02.800 --> 23:06.600
I just think he should be
able to decide how to find it.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.433
Thank you for your professional opinion.

23:08.433 --> 23:10.067
He's coming home with us.

23:41.368 --> 23:42.500
All right, sam.

23:42.500 --> 23:44.034
Let's see what you got.

23:53.034 --> 23:55.368
Great. That's what i remember.

24:24.967 --> 24:28.034
"Grandview...paramedic jim clancy
was shot and killed last night.

24:28.034 --> 24:32.567
"Clancy is survived by his wife...

24:32.567 --> 24:34.867
Melinda gordon."

24:38.800 --> 24:40.268
Hi.

24:40.268 --> 24:41.600
Am i too early?

24:41.600 --> 24:42.600
No, not at all.

24:42.600 --> 24:46.101
Let me just go open
up the garage for you.

24:46.101 --> 24:49.301
Would you mind if i had
a little coffee first?

24:49.301 --> 24:51.001
Sure. Milk, no sugar?

24:51.001 --> 24:52.567
Black's fine.

24:52.567 --> 24:53.867
Thanks.

24:56.767 --> 24:58.634
Melinda, look...

24:58.634 --> 25:00.734
Everybody's walkin'
on eggshells around me,

25:00.734 --> 25:02.734
And i can't blame them, but...

25:02.734 --> 25:06.167
I really need some honesty right now.

25:07.034 --> 25:08.634
Are you asking me a question?

25:08.634 --> 25:13.567
You hired me to do the
remodel of your garage, but...

25:15.901 --> 25:17.634
I'm startin' to get the weird feeling

25:17.634 --> 25:19.600
That there's a lot more to it.

25:20.567 --> 25:21.767
What is it?

25:21.767 --> 25:23.700
It's just...

25:25.134 --> 25:26.667
That's your husband, right?

25:31.634 --> 25:34.500
You know, you'd think
i'd recognize his face.

25:35.433 --> 25:37.034
Why would you say that?

25:37.034 --> 25:41.901
Well, he must have been
around when i started the job.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.934
Before he died, i mean.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.067
You know about that?

25:46.067 --> 25:48.101
Yeah. I read about it in the paper.

25:48.101 --> 25:50.234
I'm monopolizing your time.

25:50.234 --> 25:52.201
I'm yammering on and on.

25:52.201 --> 25:54.034
You just lost a husband.

25:55.567 --> 25:57.567
Why didn't you tell me?

25:57.567 --> 25:59.467
You had enough on your plate.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.034
You don't?

26:06.500 --> 26:08.867
Look, there's something
i have to tell you,

26:08.867 --> 26:12.767
And it's not gonna be easy
for me or for you, i'm sure.

26:12.767 --> 26:14.301
Do you have an open mind?

26:14.301 --> 26:17.467
More like an empty one, but...

26:17.467 --> 26:19.167
Do you believe in the afterlife?

26:19.167 --> 26:20.967
Heaven or ghosts?

26:20.967 --> 26:22.667
Both.

26:22.667 --> 26:25.201
What about stuff like reincarnation?

26:25.201 --> 26:28.767
Like respect cows because
they might be your ancestors?

26:28.767 --> 26:30.334
Sort of.

26:32.667 --> 26:34.600
My husband just died,

26:34.600 --> 26:38.800
And you just had a
brush with death also.

26:38.800 --> 26:41.467
Heh. Wait, you're not
gonna tell me you think

26:41.467 --> 26:42.700
I'm your husband reincarnated,

26:42.700 --> 26:44.268
Because...

26:44.268 --> 26:48.134
You're the only sane person
i've met since i woke up.

26:50.134 --> 26:51.400
No.

26:52.368 --> 26:55.934
No, of course not. I... i just...

26:55.934 --> 27:00.301
I just thought maybe you'd be able
to understand what he went through

27:00.301 --> 27:01.934
Since you just kind of died yourself,

27:01.934 --> 27:04.500
And i just need to know
he's ok wherever he is.

27:20.901 --> 27:22.934
Whatever.

27:22.934 --> 27:25.501
Ah, your high school yearbook.

27:29.133 --> 27:30.868
Oh, my god. You were such a geek.

27:30.868 --> 27:32.367
You know, jordan,

27:32.367 --> 27:35.100
You've been playing the remember
when game for about an hour now,

27:35.100 --> 27:36.934
And i'm kind of getting
the sneaking suspicion

27:36.934 --> 27:38.767
That you're trying to get me to remember

27:38.767 --> 27:40.834
When i said that i'd
lend you some money.

27:40.834 --> 27:42.701
Wow. Major buzzkill.

27:42.701 --> 27:44.334
No, really, i...

27:44.334 --> 27:47.000
Oh, there you are.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.901
Where have you been?

27:49.801 --> 27:52.067
I started work again.

27:52.067 --> 27:53.267
Oh. For that woman?

27:53.267 --> 27:54.267
Whose name is melinda, yes.

27:54.267 --> 27:55.267
Oh, listen, sweetheart,

27:55.267 --> 27:57.300
We wanted to talk to you about this.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.767
Look, i just wanna do
what feels right now.

27:59.767 --> 28:02.267
All of your doctors agree
you need to come home.

28:02.267 --> 28:05.267
What i need is for you to stop
pressuring me. I know you mean well...

28:05.267 --> 28:06.367
You're coming home with us now.

28:06.367 --> 28:08.033
We've already bought your ticket.

28:08.033 --> 28:09.234
It's nonrefundable.

28:09.234 --> 28:11.734
Good, because i'm not going.

28:11.734 --> 28:13.801
Finally, the sam i know.

28:14.868 --> 28:16.267
But you should go.

28:16.267 --> 28:17.434
Excuse me?

28:17.434 --> 28:19.634
Look, i need to decide my own future.

28:19.634 --> 28:21.868
I... i know that, and i'm ready for it,

28:21.868 --> 28:24.167
Whether i get my past back or not,

28:24.167 --> 28:26.167
But, jordan, you're barely 20 years old,

28:26.167 --> 28:27.968
And you're acting a lot less.

28:27.968 --> 28:29.601
You're not ready to
take care of yourself.

28:29.601 --> 28:32.033
Do you have any idea how
much you sound just like them?

28:32.033 --> 28:35.167
You know, you told me how
much i hated these people.

28:35.167 --> 28:36.167
Yeah.

28:36.167 --> 28:38.467
Sorry. No offense.

28:38.467 --> 28:41.467
But... but to me, they seem like
they genuinely care about us.

28:41.467 --> 28:45.033
If i can forget why i
was so angry at them,

28:45.033 --> 28:46.000
Why can't you?

28:46.000 --> 28:48.734
Hello! You lost your memory.

28:48.734 --> 28:50.767
Well, maybe you should, too.

28:52.634 --> 28:53.634
Jordan.

28:53.634 --> 28:54.634
Jordan.

28:54.634 --> 28:56.634
No. Sam, wait.

28:56.634 --> 28:59.300
Don't you run away, too, please.

29:00.133 --> 29:03.200
What's left of my mind is made up.

29:13.200 --> 29:14.367
You're here early.

29:16.334 --> 29:18.000
Hey, whatever's wrong,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.701
You don't have to hide it from me.

29:20.701 --> 29:22.601
Trust me,

29:22.601 --> 29:25.501
It's not anything you wanna hear about.

29:25.501 --> 29:27.834
Melinda, you gotta
stop thinking like that.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.601
I'm your friend,

29:29.601 --> 29:31.367
And i love you.

29:33.567 --> 29:36.200
I just...

29:36.200 --> 29:39.834
I couldn't lie anymore...

29:39.834 --> 29:43.300
So i started to tell sam the truth.

29:45.434 --> 29:47.934
Jim...

29:47.934 --> 29:51.200
He never doubted anything i told him.

29:52.300 --> 29:53.734
But sam...

29:53.734 --> 29:55.868
You should have seen
the look on his face.

29:55.868 --> 29:58.734
It's like i told him i
was abducted by aliens.

29:59.567 --> 30:01.501
I'm so sorry.

30:01.501 --> 30:06.033
I know this is probably the
worst pain you have ever felt.

30:07.367 --> 30:08.868
What do i do?

30:10.100 --> 30:11.868
You get angry. That's what.

30:11.868 --> 30:15.667
You gotta curse the universe
and break some stuff.

30:15.667 --> 30:18.367
Breaking stuff, that sounds great.

30:18.367 --> 30:21.000
It's the next stage after denial.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.834
Denial?

30:26.834 --> 30:28.701
The stages of grief.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.067
You're just going through
what we all went through,

30:31.067 --> 30:32.601
What i went through with charlie.

30:32.601 --> 30:35.033
Some people call it denial.

30:35.033 --> 30:37.701
Some call it magical thinking.

30:37.701 --> 30:41.434
Whatever it is, it's...
it's completely normal.

30:41.434 --> 30:43.234
Normal...

30:43.234 --> 30:45.167
But not real.

30:45.167 --> 30:47.300
Unfortunately, no.

30:48.601 --> 30:50.400
Do you remember jim's funeral...

30:50.400 --> 30:52.734
When everybody started to dance

30:52.734 --> 30:55.601
And i told you afterwards
that jim had made that happen

30:55.601 --> 30:57.167
And you said you believed it?

30:57.167 --> 30:59.634
You said that you could
feel him there, too.

31:00.801 --> 31:02.267
That was different.

31:02.267 --> 31:04.234
That's what you always do.

31:04.234 --> 31:06.334
You talk to ghosts or whatever it is,

31:06.334 --> 31:07.901
And you make people's lives better.

31:07.901 --> 31:10.033
Well, how is it different this time?

31:10.033 --> 31:13.167
It's different, because
you aren't helping anyone.

31:13.167 --> 31:14.667
You're not helping sam,

31:14.667 --> 31:16.334
You're not helping his family,

31:16.334 --> 31:19.434
And you are definitely
not helping yourself.

31:19.434 --> 31:21.167
The last conscious
decision my husband made

31:21.167 --> 31:23.400
Was to risk everything
just to be with me.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.634
I am not gonna turn my back on that.

31:25.634 --> 31:26.601
That's great.

31:26.601 --> 31:28.734
Believe he is out there somewhere.

31:28.734 --> 31:31.701
You are not listening to me, as usual.

31:31.701 --> 31:33.701
As usual?

31:33.701 --> 31:35.000
I know it's bizarre.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.133
All right, it's even
hard for me to believe,

31:37.133 --> 31:38.100
But it's what happened.

31:38.100 --> 31:40.033
Jim is not just "out there somewhere."

31:40.033 --> 31:42.767
He's here, in this man's body.

31:42.767 --> 31:44.601
Melinda... no, he took a chance

31:44.601 --> 31:46.901
Out of love and out of loyalty

31:46.901 --> 31:49.868
For the one person who
meant everything to him,

31:49.868 --> 31:53.000
Even though he knows it
doesn't make any sense.

31:54.334 --> 31:56.400
That is what love is,

31:56.400 --> 31:58.501
In case you're unsure.

31:59.901 --> 32:01.634
So there's no middle ground?

32:01.634 --> 32:05.033
I have to check my
common sense at the door,

32:05.033 --> 32:06.868
Or we can't be friends?

32:37.567 --> 32:39.200
Hey.

32:43.067 --> 32:45.400
What's wrong?

32:45.400 --> 32:47.300
Rough day.

32:47.300 --> 32:49.200
Me, too.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.868
You moving in?

32:52.567 --> 32:53.567
What's wrong?

32:53.567 --> 32:55.400
Well, look, i been thinkin' about this.

32:55.400 --> 32:57.734
You've been amazingly supportive.

32:57.734 --> 32:59.167
But it's just weird.

32:59.167 --> 33:01.100
I mean, i don't even know you,

33:01.100 --> 33:02.968
And suddenly i'm movin' into your place.

33:02.968 --> 33:05.267
And then what's even weirder is...

33:05.267 --> 33:08.033
I mean, how i feel when we're together.

33:08.033 --> 33:09.467
It's ok.

33:09.467 --> 33:11.300
Ah, is it?

33:12.801 --> 33:16.701
Heh. The point is...

33:16.701 --> 33:19.934
No matter how painful
this whole thing has been,

33:19.934 --> 33:21.901
I've been given a second chance,

33:21.901 --> 33:24.467
And i realized that last
night when i stood up

33:24.467 --> 33:25.767
To my parents and my sister.

33:25.767 --> 33:27.734
Ok. So, take your time.

33:27.734 --> 33:31.634
Do whatever it is that you need
to do to get your memory back.

33:31.634 --> 33:34.033
I don't know if i want to get it back.

33:37.300 --> 33:40.234
Look, i don't know if the guy i was

33:40.234 --> 33:42.934
Is the kind of guy i wanna be.

33:45.167 --> 33:47.100
What kind of guy is that?

33:47.100 --> 33:50.567
The kind that has an
affair with a married woman.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.801
Tell him.

33:58.601 --> 34:01.100
You deserve an explanation.

34:01.100 --> 34:03.100
He deserves the truth.

34:05.100 --> 34:07.834
But all i can give you right now

34:07.834 --> 34:11.601
Is that i would have never
cheated on my husband, ever.

34:12.567 --> 34:15.601
Will you tell me what
is goin' on between us?

34:15.601 --> 34:17.132
'Cause i'm confused,

34:17.132 --> 34:19.868
And whenever i'm around
you, i can't think straight.

34:19.868 --> 34:21.868
Because i feel so familiar?

34:21.868 --> 34:24.234
That's part of it.

34:24.234 --> 34:26.167
Do i feel like a friend?

34:26.167 --> 34:27.900
At least.

34:27.900 --> 34:29.067
That you can trust?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.667
I think so.

34:34.434 --> 34:35.766
Then trust me.

34:38.300 --> 34:42.266
I just don't know if i can trust myself.

34:43.367 --> 34:44.132
Sam, look...

34:44.132 --> 34:46.333
Look, thank you for helping me, ok?

34:46.333 --> 34:50.300
Thank you, but i think
we're better off if...

34:50.300 --> 34:51.501
Maybe i just go away, huh?

34:51.501 --> 34:52.100
Go?

34:52.100 --> 34:53.734
Where?

34:55.100 --> 34:56.734
I guess i'll know when i get there.

35:18.334 --> 35:19.467
Oh, melinda.

35:19.467 --> 35:20.900
Is she here? Where's sam?

35:20.900 --> 35:22.334
Where did you send him?

35:22.334 --> 35:24.034
I don't know. Oh, terrific.

35:24.034 --> 35:25.568
The boy can't remember a damn thing,

35:25.568 --> 35:27.100
And now he's out wandering all alone.

35:27.100 --> 35:28.900
Do you really think
that's what he needs?

35:28.900 --> 35:31.800
No. Actually, i wanted him to stay.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.601
Well, what are we supposed to do now?

35:34.601 --> 35:35.601
I have no idea.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.100
But if he ever gives
you a second chance,

35:37.100 --> 35:39.134
I hope you don't blow it
like you did the first time.

35:39.134 --> 35:40.534
I beg your pardon?

35:40.534 --> 35:41.967
I know what it's like to lose someone

35:41.967 --> 35:43.367
And to not know if it's for good.

35:43.367 --> 35:47.067
I know that impulse to do
everything humanly possible

35:47.067 --> 35:48.934
Just to get them back.

35:48.934 --> 35:51.367
Sometimes impulses are wrong.

35:51.367 --> 35:53.067
Are you a parent? No,

35:53.067 --> 35:54.234
And i'm not a doctor either,

35:54.234 --> 35:56.501
But believe me when i
say that you have to start

35:56.501 --> 35:58.167
Preparing yourself for
the fact that your son

35:58.167 --> 35:59.501
May never remember who he was.

35:59.501 --> 36:00.668
Look, ms. Gordon...

36:00.668 --> 36:03.067
And you should be grateful
for that. You know why?

36:03.067 --> 36:04.568
Because you'll actually have a son.

36:06.334 --> 36:08.167
At some point, he's
gonna need his family,

36:08.167 --> 36:09.367
And he will call,

36:09.367 --> 36:11.501
But all he's gonna
remember is who you are now,

36:11.501 --> 36:13.668
So wouldn't you want
that to be a good thing?

36:13.668 --> 36:15.167
What is that supposed to mean, exactly?

36:15.167 --> 36:16.434
You've held on to your children

36:16.434 --> 36:18.401
So tight that you've lost them both.

36:19.668 --> 36:22.301
But there's still time
to maybe get them back,

36:22.301 --> 36:25.134
But not if you keep
making the same mistakes.

36:30.267 --> 36:32.800
Hey. Where are you?

36:32.800 --> 36:34.267
At the cafe, doing homework.

36:34.267 --> 36:36.034
Oh. I thought i'd surprise you

36:36.034 --> 36:37.334
And stop by and take you out

36:37.334 --> 36:38.867
For something to eat,
but you're not here.

36:38.867 --> 36:40.034
Where? At the courts.

36:40.034 --> 36:41.767
Isn't your shooting clinic on mondays?

36:41.767 --> 36:45.100
Ok, promise you won't get mad.

36:45.100 --> 36:48.900
Well, i promise i will if
you don't start talkin'.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.700
Mom, there's no shooting
clinic on mondays.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.134
What?

36:53.134 --> 36:54.900
I used to meet jim there
on mondays to practice,

36:54.900 --> 36:56.900
But i didn't tell you
it was just him and me,

36:56.900 --> 36:58.100
Because i was afraid if you knew,

36:58.100 --> 37:00.401
You'd make me come and
work at the store instead.

37:00.401 --> 37:02.201
Ned, i wish you would have...

37:02.201 --> 37:03.668
Mom, please don't be mad.

37:03.668 --> 37:05.301
I'm not mad. I'm ju...

37:16.334 --> 37:18.767
I have to call you back.

37:34.534 --> 37:35.867
Sam?

37:42.800 --> 37:45.100
Hey. Delia, right?

37:46.000 --> 37:47.634
What are you doin' here?

37:47.634 --> 37:50.767
Heh. Promise not to laugh?

37:53.401 --> 37:54.934
I have no idea.

37:54.934 --> 37:57.034
I was drivin' out of town.

37:57.034 --> 37:58.000
I was leaving...

37:58.000 --> 38:00.201
And then suddenly i got this feeling

38:00.201 --> 38:02.467
That i was supposed to be somewhere,

38:02.467 --> 38:04.833
Somewhere important.

38:06.067 --> 38:07.900
So i just came here.

38:09.967 --> 38:12.267
Weird, isn't it? Heh.

38:12.267 --> 38:14.867
Yeah. You could say that.

38:14.867 --> 38:17.534
I was hoping someone
would recognize me...

38:17.534 --> 38:21.067
They could tell me why i had to be here.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.733
It's really you.

38:26.833 --> 38:28.000
Sorry?

38:30.434 --> 38:33.733
I think you could be right.

38:33.733 --> 38:36.668
I think you are
supposed to be somewhere.

38:38.301 --> 38:39.867
Where?

38:50.833 --> 38:52.534
You tried.

38:54.034 --> 38:56.067
I will never forget that.

39:04.401 --> 39:07.100
If you never forgive
me, i will understand,

39:07.100 --> 39:08.501
But i couldn't just sit
around and do nothing

39:08.501 --> 39:09.934
When this whole thing
was ready to blow away.

39:09.934 --> 39:12.067
What whole thing? What
are you talking about?

39:12.067 --> 39:13.568
You and jim, your future together,

39:13.568 --> 39:14.601
Your whole everything.

39:14.601 --> 39:15.800
Are you drunk?

39:15.800 --> 39:17.767
No, there is no time to explain, mel.

39:17.767 --> 39:18.733
He's outside.

39:18.733 --> 39:20.100
Who? Jim.

39:20.100 --> 39:21.967
I mean sam... jim... sam...

39:21.967 --> 39:22.967
Whatever the hell his name is.

39:22.967 --> 39:24.401
But i convinced him to come back

39:24.401 --> 39:25.434
And talk to you, but you have to

39:25.434 --> 39:26.467
Figure out what to do next.

39:26.467 --> 39:27.733
Where did you?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.568
He was on the basketball
court on the way out of town.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.034
I saw him, i stopped,
and i convinced him

39:31.034 --> 39:32.301
To come back and talk to you.

39:32.301 --> 39:33.967
Why did you?

39:35.234 --> 39:37.568
Because he was waiting for ned,

39:37.568 --> 39:39.634
And i finally understood.

39:40.967 --> 39:42.201
What?

39:44.234 --> 39:45.634
That i was wrong.

39:45.634 --> 39:48.501
Ok? About pretty much everything.

39:48.501 --> 39:51.700
And i know that we are gonna talk
about this endlessly in the future,

39:51.700 --> 39:53.467
But right now, you have to go outside

39:53.467 --> 39:56.201
And make sure that jim does
not get back on that road

39:56.201 --> 39:57.867
And go out of town.

39:57.867 --> 40:01.134
You keep calling him jim.

40:02.434 --> 40:04.634
That's who he is, isn't he?

40:06.767 --> 40:09.034
Ok. Stop. Go.

40:09.034 --> 40:10.401
It's ok.

40:10.401 --> 40:12.234
Got my best friend back.

40:16.401 --> 40:17.467
Ok, quit your blubbering.

40:17.467 --> 40:18.467
You made me blubber.

40:18.467 --> 40:20.034
Oh, wait a sec.

40:20.034 --> 40:21.568
Delia.

40:21.568 --> 40:22.634
There's a stain on it.

40:22.634 --> 40:24.167
You gotta really be presentable.

40:24.167 --> 40:25.867
You got any lip gloss?

40:25.867 --> 40:28.467
No, if it's jim, i don't need lip gloss.

40:28.467 --> 40:30.267
Do you know how lucky you are?

40:30.267 --> 40:34.833
You are gonna get a second
shot at your one true love.

40:36.234 --> 40:38.367
Ok. Go.

40:38.367 --> 40:39.767
Go, go, go.

40:39.767 --> 40:40.934
Ok.

40:48.833 --> 40:49.867
Hi.

40:49.867 --> 40:51.467
Hey.

40:51.467 --> 40:52.733
You're back.

40:52.733 --> 40:55.534
I apologize for before.

40:55.534 --> 40:57.601
I got a little overdramatic.

40:57.601 --> 40:58.668
It's ok. I don't...

40:58.668 --> 41:01.167
I mean, if i'm on
some search to find out

41:01.167 --> 41:03.501
What feels right in my life, you know,

41:03.501 --> 41:05.367
What places and what people,

41:05.367 --> 41:06.700
You know, i should take baby steps.

41:06.700 --> 41:08.634
I should start at square
one and not square 10.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.668
And if that does...

41:09.668 --> 41:12.167
You know what? Whatever
your reasons are,

41:12.167 --> 41:13.534
I'm fine with it.

41:13.534 --> 41:15.833
You don't need to explain anything.

41:15.833 --> 41:19.167
Maybe that's best for
now, for both of us.

41:19.167 --> 41:21.034
Ok.

41:21.034 --> 41:22.167
Ok.

41:22.167 --> 41:24.467
Can i move this stuff into your garage?

41:24.467 --> 41:26.134
Yeah. I'll help you.

41:26.134 --> 41:27.668
Thanks.

41:31.067 --> 41:32.601
Hey, you guys need some help?

41:32.601 --> 41:34.267
Sure. Sure.

41:37.501 --> 41:39.401
Did i mention my...

41:39.401 --> 41:41.367
Parents called my sister

41:41.367 --> 41:46.267
And apologized for a lifetime
of controlling behavior?

41:46.267 --> 41:50.367
And then jordan just got up
and went back home with them.

41:50.367 --> 41:51.800
I had no idea.

41:51.800 --> 41:55.100
Oh, yeah? Because when i asked
them why the big change of heart,

41:55.100 --> 41:56.767
They said that they had talked to you

41:56.767 --> 42:00.201
And that you had talked sense to them.

42:01.767 --> 42:02.900
How'd you do that?

42:02.900 --> 42:05.000
I have a few talents.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.100
A few talents?

42:06.100 --> 42:07.800
That's what you're gonna leave me with?

42:08.733 --> 42:10.401
Ok.

42:11.401 --> 42:12.934
No explanations.

42:13.800 --> 42:15.134
I'll be right there.

42:17.900 --> 42:19.934
Hey, sam, why don't you...

42:19.934 --> 42:21.900
Show me what you're plannin'
to do with the space in here?

42:21.900 --> 42:23.467
Love to, if i can remember.

42:23.467 --> 42:24.668
I know what you're thinking.

42:24.668 --> 42:27.634
It's a good thing you
didn't listen to me.

42:27.634 --> 42:29.934
I beg your pardon?

42:29.934 --> 42:31.867
If there's one thing
i thought being dead

42:31.867 --> 42:34.301
Would make me an expert
on, it was being dead,

42:34.301 --> 42:35.733
But i was wrong.

42:35.733 --> 42:38.467
That's your specialty, like you said.

42:38.467 --> 42:41.167
I've been at it a while.

42:42.367 --> 42:44.700
I wanted them to have the closure,

42:44.700 --> 42:47.833
But you held out for more.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.733
You gave them their family back.

42:55.134 --> 42:56.301
Are you ready?

42:57.334 --> 42:58.800
To go into the light?

42:58.800 --> 43:00.934
It's been following me around all day.

43:02.301 --> 43:06.501
But there is one thing i wanted
to say to you before i went in.

43:06.501 --> 43:08.000
What?

43:08.000 --> 43:11.167
What your husband did
might just be a miracle.

43:12.234 --> 43:13.833
I hope it is,

43:13.833 --> 43:15.967
Because after a lifetime of this,

43:15.967 --> 43:18.134
A miracle's what you deserve.

43:28.034 --> 43:30.501
Hey, you ok?

43:31.434 --> 43:32.800
Yeah.
