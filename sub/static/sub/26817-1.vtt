01:27.488 --> 01:28.349
- Turn it off.

01:28.350 --> 01:30.516
- Oh, shh, you love it.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.525
- Turn it off.

01:34.593 --> 01:38.159
Why can't you put that
on your side of the bed?

01:38.160 --> 01:40.010
- 'Cause then I don't
get to do this.

01:41.211 --> 01:42.211
- No.

01:43.013 --> 01:44.629
- No.
- Come on, please.

01:44.630 --> 01:45.810
- Please.

01:45.811 --> 01:48.570
- Yes.

01:48.571 --> 01:49.732
- No.

01:49.733 --> 01:51.270
- And, yes.
- No.

02:03.916 --> 02:07.916
- See ya in a little bit
I'm gonna go for a run.

02:16.766 --> 02:17.889
- Hey, babe.

02:17.890 --> 02:18.890
- In my office.

02:25.180 --> 02:27.429
Hey, good morning.

02:27.430 --> 02:28.959
- Good morning.

02:28.960 --> 02:30.192
- What?

02:30.193 --> 02:31.469
- Call me on your way back.

02:31.470 --> 02:35.520
I got croissants and ETA
eight minutes in the oven.

02:35.521 --> 02:38.438
- Croissants, eh, fancy.

02:40.534 --> 02:41.867
You're freezing.

02:44.396 --> 02:45.535
I shouldn't be too long.

02:45.536 --> 02:47.216
- All right.
- Alright, I'll see you later.

02:49.732 --> 02:50.968
Love you.

02:50.969 --> 02:51.969
- Love you.

03:39.810 --> 03:40.643
- Pretty beautiful,
morning, huh?

03:40.644 --> 03:42.330
- Yeah, it sure is.

03:42.331 --> 03:44.164
- Good day.
- You too.

04:19.700 --> 04:21.339
- Hi, this is Lilly Tarver.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.173
Please leave a message

04:22.174 --> 04:23.960
and I'll get back to
you soon as you I can.

05:07.437 --> 05:12.079
Hey, babe I'm gonna guess and
say you're on your way back.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.829
So, if I'm wrong, let me know.

05:14.830 --> 05:17.404
Otherwise I'll see you
in a few, love ya.

05:55.523 --> 05:58.949
- Time of death was
approximately 6:30 a.m.

05:58.950 --> 06:00.000
Get them out of here.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.069
- Yeah, we said
hi to each other,

06:03.070 --> 06:05.280
and we had a conversation.

06:05.281 --> 06:07.904
Oh, my god, I can't believe
this is happening to me.

06:07.905 --> 06:09.139
- Please go.
- Alright.

06:09.140 --> 06:10.832
- Fine.
- Thank you.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.446
- Do you know what time...
- I feel sick.

06:12.447 --> 06:14.199
I feel so sick.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.393
- About an hour ago.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.639
24 hours are you fucking crazy?

06:19.640 --> 06:22.469
No, I am telling you something
has happened to him.

06:22.470 --> 06:24.230
This is not like him.

06:38.010 --> 06:39.010
- Found it.

06:44.353 --> 06:46.020
- Who's this?

06:47.830 --> 06:49.899
- This is Lilly Tarver.

06:49.900 --> 06:51.400
I'm calling my husband Jeremy.

07:19.770 --> 07:22.809
- There's just a few things
I'd like to go over.

07:22.810 --> 07:26.176
Jeremy's body was
found at 6:45 a.m.,

07:26.177 --> 07:30.619
and we believe the time of
death was right before then

07:30.620 --> 07:32.453
at approximately 6:30 a.m.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.863
Jeremy suffered
severe head trauma.

07:41.070 --> 07:45.869
Mrs. Tarver, this isn't
going to be easy to hear,

07:45.870 --> 07:50.870
but Jeremy was also
posthumously castrated.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.000
- Excuse me.

07:58.320 --> 08:00.719
- Is there anyone
other than yourself

08:00.720 --> 08:04.779
that would know when
Jeremy went jogging

08:04.780 --> 08:06.619
at what time this morning?

08:06.620 --> 08:09.288
- Yeah, probably everybody.

08:09.289 --> 08:11.563
He ran every morning.

08:12.620 --> 08:14.819
- Did he have any enemies
that you can think of?

08:14.820 --> 08:16.839
Any recent arguments
with anybody?

08:16.840 --> 08:18.129
Anybody threaten to harm him?

08:18.130 --> 08:19.615
- No.

08:19.616 --> 08:22.723
No, Jeremy was married
to his research, me.

08:26.030 --> 08:27.033
- One other thing.

08:27.890 --> 08:32.946
He works for a company
I-Gen or IGen Electronics?

08:32.970 --> 08:35.342
- Yes, they have a
contract with JPL.

08:38.092 --> 08:40.392
- Do you have any idea
what he was working on?

08:41.246 --> 08:45.383
- I don't know some new
communication device, I think.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.420
- Okay, that was very helpful.

08:53.966 --> 08:54.966
Thank you.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.429
- The police are gonna.

09:10.430 --> 09:12.489
You know, they're
gonna catch the

09:12.490 --> 09:16.543
psychopath asshole who did this.

09:17.820 --> 09:18.820
I know it.

09:22.030 --> 09:23.183
This is crazy, right?

09:26.090 --> 09:30.923
- You know what's really sad
besides, you know, everything.

09:32.350 --> 09:33.350
- What?

09:34.570 --> 09:35.730
- He tried to call me

09:39.140 --> 09:41.483
right before it
happened, I think.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.833
But he didn't leave a message.

09:45.820 --> 09:47.203
I just got a missed call.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.378
I just keep wishing
so hard that he had,

09:51.379 --> 09:52.853
so I could hear his voice.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.080
- Oh, sweetie.

10:04.600 --> 10:05.933
Well, there's two.

10:07.170 --> 10:08.829
- What?

10:08.830 --> 10:10.863
- There's two missed
calls from Jeremy.

10:12.770 --> 10:13.870
- That can't be right.

10:16.180 --> 10:17.549
- Well, maybe you just
remembered it wrong.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.613
When's the last time you
checked your phone?

10:20.820 --> 10:22.369
- This morning.

10:22.370 --> 10:25.909
- Well, a lot has
happened since then.

10:25.910 --> 10:28.323
You know, so maybe you just
don't remember it right.

10:32.485 --> 10:33.485
See look.

10:34.325 --> 10:37.408
The first missed
call is at 6:29 a.m.

10:38.730 --> 10:41.589
Second missed call
is at 7:01 a.m.

10:41.590 --> 10:43.549
- It has to be wrong.

10:43.550 --> 10:44.550
- Why?

10:46.170 --> 10:49.519
- The police said
Jeremy died at 6:30

10:49.520 --> 10:51.833
and his body was found at 6:45.

10:55.140 --> 10:57.236
- Well, it was a beautiful
service, you know

10:57.237 --> 10:58.829
and you did so good.

10:58.830 --> 11:01.389
I love that you told
that story about Jeremy

11:01.390 --> 11:04.140
how he almost burned the house
down on your first date.

11:05.150 --> 11:06.150
I remember that.

11:07.550 --> 11:09.579
- Remember when we
dragged you to Big Bear?

11:09.580 --> 11:10.809
He almost burned that rental.

11:10.810 --> 11:11.859
- Yeah.

11:11.860 --> 11:14.722
- And then he took that
cooking course, so.

11:14.723 --> 11:17.869
- Well, yeah, 'cause he
wanted to make you happy

11:17.870 --> 11:20.179
and he did, right,
he made you happy.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.843
- Yeah, he did.

11:23.687 --> 11:25.478
- Okay, well, I'm gonna go.

11:25.479 --> 11:26.312
Are you okay?

11:26.313 --> 11:27.439
- Yeah, thank you.

11:27.440 --> 11:29.289
- Okay, and I'll call you later.

11:29.290 --> 11:30.290
- Okay.

11:33.710 --> 11:34.710
Who is that?

11:35.430 --> 11:36.430
- Who?

11:40.510 --> 11:41.979
- You didn't see her?

11:41.980 --> 11:44.013
- Uh-huh, no.

11:44.920 --> 11:45.753
Oh, but don't worry, okay.

11:45.754 --> 11:47.479
'Cause you know funerals

11:47.480 --> 11:49.085
people just come out
of the wood work.

11:49.086 --> 11:51.609
- Hey, Lilly, just if you want

11:51.610 --> 11:54.109
I can pack up Jeremy's laptop

11:54.110 --> 11:56.059
and his other
personal belongings

11:56.060 --> 11:57.310
and bring them over here.

11:58.210 --> 11:59.729
- That'd be great, thanks.

11:59.730 --> 12:00.929
- You know, I should
probably check out

12:00.930 --> 12:02.409
some of his stuff
here just in case

12:02.410 --> 12:05.279
there're any details that
pertain to the project.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.869
- His office is a bit
of a mess right now.

12:07.870 --> 12:09.513
- Yeah, no hurry, no hurry.

12:14.470 --> 12:19.163
Do the police think that
it was someone he knew or?

12:21.030 --> 12:22.253
It's just absurd.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.659
Seems like a freak
killing to me.

12:25.660 --> 12:28.359
I mean who would
want Jeremy dead.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.889
- Okay, you know what
now is not the time

12:30.890 --> 12:33.259
to try to solve the case.

12:33.260 --> 12:34.399
- Yeah.
- Right.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.389
- Yeah, we were just talking.

12:36.390 --> 12:37.390
- Right.

12:40.022 --> 12:44.273
- Okay.

12:44.274 --> 12:45.849
- You okay?

12:45.850 --> 12:46.850
- Yeah.

12:48.256 --> 12:49.089
- Okay.

12:49.090 --> 12:50.793
- I'll walk you out.
- Yeah, yeah.

14:23.653 --> 14:26.189
- Is something new, a suspect?

14:26.190 --> 14:27.623
- There is something.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.769
Two years ago we
found the bodies

14:30.770 --> 14:33.899
of a couple Claire
and Richard Fawner

14:33.900 --> 14:38.139
in one of the more secluded
Griffith Park trails.

14:38.140 --> 14:41.949
A similar M/O to Jeremy's
with severe head trauma

14:41.950 --> 14:44.573
and post mortem
removal genitalia.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.773
And we also found this.

14:54.010 --> 14:55.239
It's Sanskrit.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.239
It means continuous flow.

14:58.240 --> 15:03.240
The repeating cycle of
life, death, and rebirth.

15:03.470 --> 15:04.411
- You didn't mention there was

15:04.412 --> 15:06.039
anything like this
on Jeremy's body.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.893
- Well, we didn't understand
what it meant at the time.

15:10.340 --> 15:12.513
- Jeremy was attacked
by a serial killer.

15:14.500 --> 15:16.937
- Claire and Richard Fawner were

15:20.680 --> 15:25.079
well, known to be swingers?

15:25.080 --> 15:27.683
The M/O is so similar.

15:28.580 --> 15:31.009
I need to know if
you and Jeremy.

15:31.010 --> 15:34.123
- Jeremy and I were in a strictly
monogamous relationship.

15:35.020 --> 15:39.023
We had a very nice,
normal sex life.

15:40.110 --> 15:41.110
- All right.

15:43.450 --> 15:44.390
Thank you.

15:44.391 --> 15:46.573
I can see myself out.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.000
Thanks for the coffee.

17:27.510 --> 17:28.633
- Hello.

17:31.320 --> 17:32.343
Who is this?

17:42.976 --> 17:44.327
No, no.

17:48.050 --> 17:49.239
- Do you know how easy it is

17:49.240 --> 17:51.333
to fake call you from
Jeremy's number?

17:52.450 --> 17:53.649
It's like...

17:53.650 --> 17:55.489
You know, like Hacking 101.

17:55.490 --> 17:57.903
I'm sure that anybody
with a laptop can do it.

17:58.780 --> 17:59.879
Like Skype you just pick out

17:59.880 --> 18:02.059
a number that you
wanna call with.

18:02.060 --> 18:05.622
Or maybe the phone company
just already reassigned it.

18:05.623 --> 18:07.253
- That seems really unlikely.

18:08.365 --> 18:11.023
I mean who would be so
cruel to do this to me?

18:11.860 --> 18:13.660
- Well, what about
Jeremy's ex-wife.

18:14.896 --> 18:15.860
- I never met her.

18:15.860 --> 18:16.860
- Exactly.

18:18.110 --> 18:20.873
You know, maybe she's the one
with the sick sense of humor.

18:22.413 --> 18:23.413
- I don't know.

18:24.101 --> 18:26.001
It just didn't feel
like a prank call.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.620
- Well, what did it feel like?

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
- Like,

18:32.560 --> 18:33.560
Jeremy.

18:35.460 --> 18:37.362
- Yeah, because.

18:37.363 --> 18:40.253
Because that's what
you want it to be.

18:43.610 --> 18:45.089
Sweetie, just do me a favor.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.049
Okay, before you pull
out the Ouija boards

18:47.050 --> 18:49.969
and before you light this
whole house up with candles,

18:49.970 --> 18:54.083
can you just call the phone
company and check it out, okay?

18:55.338 --> 18:56.338
- Yeah.

18:59.349 --> 19:01.239
- Oh, and hey, you
know next month

19:01.240 --> 19:04.199
we're having a group
showing at the gallery.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.239
Maybe you could
submit something.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.749
- I haven't felt like painting.

19:08.750 --> 19:10.580
- I know, I know I just...

19:11.650 --> 19:13.050
I thought it would help you.

19:15.270 --> 19:16.633
- You might be right.

19:18.070 --> 19:19.070
I should try.

19:20.509 --> 19:25.509
- Yeah.

19:25.680 --> 19:27.730
Here, honey, I want
you to take some tea.

19:31.958 --> 19:35.441
You're gonna be okay.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.947
- Yeah.
- Gonna be okay.

19:36.948 --> 19:39.218
- Gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.019
- I'm gonna call
that phone company.

19:42.410 --> 19:43.852
- Ma'am, I'm sorry
are you there?

19:43.853 --> 19:46.119
- No, I have been
on hold forever.

19:46.120 --> 19:46.990
- Yeah, I wish I could help you.

19:46.990 --> 19:47.823
But there's nothing we could do.

19:47.824 --> 19:50.469
- Yes, I closed his
account August 21st.

19:50.470 --> 19:52.039
- Yeah, well, looked, and it...

19:52.040 --> 19:54.319
- No, I know it's closed and
it shouldn't be working.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.099
But can you think of any
reason why it might be?

19:56.100 --> 19:57.259
- Ma'am this is not
my department.

19:57.260 --> 19:58.619
- I'd have to send a...
- No.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.269
- Can you understand I have
to talk to the tech team?

20:00.270 --> 20:02.989
- Yeah, well, somebody is
calling me from his number.

20:02.990 --> 20:04.649
- Ma'am, you're talking
to the wrong person here.

20:04.650 --> 20:06.163
- Yes, from his number.

20:07.150 --> 20:08.299
- Can you please hold?

20:08.300 --> 20:10.053
- Fine, I will hold.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.999
- Ma'am.
- Yeah.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.939
- There's been no calls, ma'am.

20:17.940 --> 20:20.719
- So you're saying that
no calls have been made

20:20.720 --> 20:22.779
from his number
since August 21st?

20:22.780 --> 20:24.209
- There's been no calls, ma'am.

20:24.210 --> 20:25.289
- You're sure?

20:25.290 --> 20:26.416
- Let me give you a case number

20:26.417 --> 20:27.397
and we can talk to someone...

20:27.398 --> 20:29.729
- No, I don't need
a case number.

20:29.730 --> 20:30.620
- 8-6.

20:30.620 --> 20:31.620
- Fine.

20:32.370 --> 20:37.370
- J-0-4-9-0-K-L-J-6.

20:41.230 --> 20:42.479
- Okay, yeah.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.449
- Yeah, I'm sorry, ma'am
there's nothing we can do.

20:44.450 --> 20:45.450
- Thank you.

20:59.881 --> 21:01.048
Ghosts.

21:14.587 --> 21:15.587
Okay.

21:21.820 --> 21:26.820
Dennis Faxson, Voices
From Beyond by Telephone

21:27.660 --> 21:30.819
the results of a two year
investigation into a

21:30.820 --> 21:34.257
previously unexplored
paranormal and paraphysical.

21:36.870 --> 21:39.249
It is my plan to
continue researching

21:39.250 --> 21:40.989
anomalous telephone experiences

21:40.990 --> 21:45.063
and build awareness of
this neglected phenomenon.

21:46.655 --> 21:47.655
Dennis.

21:49.540 --> 21:50.540
Perfect.

22:02.970 --> 22:03.999
- Lily Tarver.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.429
- Yes, and you're...

22:07.430 --> 22:08.327
You're Dennis.

22:08.327 --> 22:09.327
- Faxson.

22:15.030 --> 22:17.369
So, I know who you are.

22:17.370 --> 22:18.683
You know who I am.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.609
I know what you think
is happening to you.

22:21.610 --> 22:23.012
What can I do for you.
- What do you mean what I

22:23.013 --> 22:25.354
I think is happening to me?

22:25.355 --> 22:27.379
I'm one of those cases
you've written about.

22:27.380 --> 22:29.229
- No, no you think you're
one of those cases.

22:29.230 --> 22:30.323
- I don't think.

22:31.430 --> 22:32.430
I know.

22:33.690 --> 22:35.239
You wrote about people having

22:35.240 --> 22:36.909
actual conversations
with someone

22:36.910 --> 22:39.623
who had turned out
to be deceased.

22:40.990 --> 22:42.779
- The people on the
receiving end didn't know

22:42.780 --> 22:46.053
the person they were talking
to was dead, you knew.

22:47.170 --> 22:49.809
- Okay, but you also
wrote that these calls

22:49.810 --> 22:52.529
were sometimes messages or
warnings from the beyond.

22:52.530 --> 22:54.830
- I get people like you
every once in a while,

22:56.140 --> 22:59.679
and trust me 99% of
the time it's either

22:59.680 --> 23:02.983
a dream, a hallucination,
or a hoax.

23:05.910 --> 23:06.910
- Wow.

23:09.660 --> 23:11.403
You really are an asshole.

23:13.680 --> 23:15.789
I imagine it must be difficult

23:15.790 --> 23:18.339
researching something so rare.

23:18.340 --> 23:21.579
I bet you started out all
wide eyed and hopeful,

23:21.580 --> 23:23.689
and then came one
disappointment after the next.

23:23.690 --> 23:26.229
And suddenly one day
you find yourself

23:26.230 --> 23:28.723
a little bitter, resentful.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.660
So you start acting like a jerk

23:32.950 --> 23:34.109
because then at
least you get to be

23:34.110 --> 23:35.710
the one doing the disappointing.

23:37.060 --> 23:38.069
- Let me recap this for you.

23:38.070 --> 23:40.339
Since the invention of the
telephone until the present day

23:40.340 --> 23:42.749
there have been a total
of 50 cases worldwide.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.759
That's about a 100 years of
humanity making phone calls.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.909
Billions, trillions
of phone calls,

23:47.910 --> 23:49.499
text massages, voicemails

23:49.500 --> 23:51.369
I don't even know
50 next to that,

23:51.370 --> 23:53.369
50 that's nothing.

23:53.370 --> 23:54.743
It's a drop in the ocean.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.759
- Whatever.

23:57.760 --> 23:58.913
- Mrs. Tarver, hold on?

24:02.650 --> 24:04.220
All I'm saying is that

24:05.900 --> 24:09.073
given the nature in which
the way your husband died,

24:11.130 --> 24:13.049
you may wanna
consider that whoever

24:13.050 --> 24:16.023
or whatever it is could
be coming for you next.

24:19.270 --> 24:20.270
And one more thing.

24:21.130 --> 24:22.189
You've called the phone company,

24:22.190 --> 24:24.619
but do you have your
husband's cellphone?

24:24.620 --> 24:27.933
- No, it's still in evidence.

24:37.023 --> 24:38.023
- Here.

24:39.363 --> 24:42.309
Write down any information
you might have.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.859
The lead detective's
name, station

24:44.860 --> 24:46.473
what else you can think of.

24:48.531 --> 24:50.031
- What are you gonna steal it?

24:51.247 --> 24:53.147
- I'm glad I give you
that impression.

24:57.346 --> 24:58.346
- Thank you.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.829
- And down the line any kind of

25:01.830 --> 25:03.339
concrete proof that
you might have

25:03.340 --> 25:05.899
that these phone calls
are actually happening

25:05.900 --> 25:08.163
in your I'm sure very
vivid imagination,

25:10.340 --> 25:11.943
that would help too, okay.

25:13.010 --> 25:14.060
It's been a pleasure.

25:16.500 --> 25:19.247
- Oh, you can use an app.

25:20.538 --> 25:23.810
The recorder app records
my phone calls.

25:35.947 --> 25:36.947
Got it.

25:37.970 --> 25:40.439
- Mrs. Tarver, this
is Detective Becker.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.893
Are you by any chance
by your computer?

25:44.090 --> 25:45.449
I just emailed you something

25:45.450 --> 25:47.453
well, I'd like you
to take a look at.

25:49.280 --> 25:50.780
It's a photograph in the file.

25:51.970 --> 25:53.969
- Who's the guy in the photo?

25:53.970 --> 25:55.829
- That's Rudger Stanton.

25:55.830 --> 25:57.053
He works in real estate.

25:57.940 --> 25:59.163
- Did he know Jeremy?

26:00.885 --> 26:01.889
- He was very well acquainted

26:01.890 --> 26:03.449
with the previous two victims.

26:03.450 --> 26:05.733
I thought maybe it
was worth a shot.

26:06.980 --> 26:08.379
- Did he admit to
being very well

26:08.380 --> 26:10.092
acquainted with my husband?

26:10.093 --> 26:10.926
- Ugh.

26:10.927 --> 26:12.671
- That's impossible he's lying.

26:12.672 --> 26:14.637
- It's possible he's not.

26:14.638 --> 26:15.471
- I mean are you just gonna wait

26:15.472 --> 26:16.559
for the next body to show up?

26:16.560 --> 26:18.840
Will that move your
investigation along further?

26:18.841 --> 26:20.199
- I know it's
frustrating, but...

26:20.200 --> 26:21.580
- Thank you, detective.

26:42.994 --> 26:44.827
Jeremy's phone.

26:44.828 --> 26:46.495
Dennis, you're good.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.326
No service available.

27:02.174 --> 27:04.007
That's what I thought.

27:12.598 --> 27:13.598
Tim Warner.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.305
Work, home.

27:25.829 --> 27:26.829
Parker.

27:29.813 --> 27:31.979
- I don't think there are any
other personal belongings,

27:31.980 --> 27:34.559
but whatever Gus found I
told him to pack up for you.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.730
- Thanks for bringing it over.

27:35.731 --> 27:37.653
- Yeah, yeah, of course.

27:43.347 --> 27:44.764
We were so close.

27:47.850 --> 27:48.810
Only a few more weeks

27:48.811 --> 27:50.860
and he would've seen
the first prototype.

27:53.750 --> 27:56.689
If it works NASA will
be the first in line.

27:56.690 --> 27:57.729
- That's great.

27:57.730 --> 27:58.563
- Yeah.

27:58.564 --> 28:01.789
- He didn't really tell
me all the details.

28:01.790 --> 28:04.359
It's a quantum communicator.

28:04.360 --> 28:05.883
- Cryptography, yeah.

28:07.290 --> 28:08.599
I won't bore you with
all the details,

28:08.600 --> 28:12.139
but we used quantum particles
of light particles

28:12.140 --> 28:13.829
to secure cyber communication.

28:13.830 --> 28:15.799
So far that's only
be successful with

28:15.800 --> 28:17.783
distances over a
100 miles or so.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.003
We're looking at space.

28:21.480 --> 28:22.320
- That's big.
- Yeah.

28:22.320 --> 28:23.153
- Space.

28:23.154 --> 28:24.270
- Yeah, it's pretty cool.

28:25.222 --> 28:27.429
- Well, I guess if
anyone could figure out

28:27.430 --> 28:29.399
how to communicate
through the ether,

28:29.400 --> 28:30.600
it would've been Jeremy.

28:32.490 --> 28:34.389
- For sure, yeah.

28:34.390 --> 28:38.579
You know, I heard
that he put your name

28:38.580 --> 28:42.459
on the patent as a sort
of life insurance.

28:42.460 --> 28:43.460
- Really.

28:44.410 --> 28:46.859
- Yeah, yeah, I'd
look into that.

28:46.860 --> 28:47.860
- I will.

28:48.630 --> 28:50.030
Do you mind if...

28:51.660 --> 28:54.179
I'd like to go through
this on my own.

28:54.180 --> 28:55.789
- Yeah, of course, of course.

28:55.790 --> 28:58.170
If you need anything else,
just give me a call again.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.076
- I will.
- Okay.

29:00.077 --> 29:00.993
- Thanks.

29:00.994 --> 29:02.115
- Yeah.

30:20.206 --> 30:21.623
- Hello.

30:23.586 --> 30:24.586
Hello.

30:45.385 --> 30:46.385
- Yes.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.800
- We got disconnected.

30:50.910 --> 30:52.003
- Who are you?

30:53.250 --> 30:54.979
- You called me.

30:54.980 --> 30:56.030
I thought you'd know.

30:57.710 --> 31:00.463
- I do kind of know.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.165
- You're new to this.

31:04.166 --> 31:05.423
- Yeah.

31:06.540 --> 31:08.273
- Who put you in touch with us?

31:09.600 --> 31:10.600
- Claire.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.509
- That must have been
a long time ago.

31:15.510 --> 31:17.723
You know she passed on.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.200
- I know.

31:21.010 --> 31:22.883
It was a while ago.

31:23.860 --> 31:28.860
I never could quite get the
courage up to actually call.

31:30.860 --> 31:31.860
- Why now?

31:34.860 --> 31:36.739
- I don't know.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.559
I'm alone now.

31:38.560 --> 31:41.033
I could use some human contact.

31:42.370 --> 31:44.133
I'm really quite lost.

31:45.060 --> 31:46.933
- You don't have
to feel that way.

31:48.090 --> 31:52.063
Come by a Saturday night 8:00

31:52.064 --> 31:54.873
119 Ridgeway Road.

31:56.858 --> 31:59.765
- It's in...
- Sherman Oaks.

31:59.766 --> 32:01.099
- Yes.

32:03.980 --> 32:05.583
- Should I bring anything?

32:07.150 --> 32:10.403
- Vaseline, your favorite
whip, anything latex.

32:11.800 --> 32:12.800
I'm kidding.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.243
Really, kidding.

32:16.750 --> 32:17.750
Just bring yourself.

32:18.948 --> 32:21.432
- Okay, I will.

32:21.433 --> 32:23.317
- I'm looking forward
to meeting you.

32:24.793 --> 32:26.293
- Me too.

32:43.695 --> 32:44.695
Jeremy.

32:45.843 --> 32:47.313
Jeremy, is that you?

32:49.510 --> 32:51.519
Whoever you are
I'm tracking you,

32:51.520 --> 32:53.139
and I'm gonna make
you pay for this.

32:53.140 --> 32:54.423
This isn't funny anymore.

32:57.250 --> 32:59.000
And, Jeremy, if
this is really you,

33:01.020 --> 33:03.103
then fuck you, you
piece of shit.

33:04.679 --> 33:06.560
I don't know who
you are or were,

33:08.915 --> 33:11.862
and I don't know what
you're trying to tell me.

33:11.863 --> 33:13.989
But I don't ever wanna
talk to you ever again.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.527
Just fuck you.

33:33.732 --> 33:34.831
- Hi.

33:34.832 --> 33:35.989
- Hello.

33:35.990 --> 33:38.153
- Welcome to the love
nest of decadence.

33:39.870 --> 33:40.923
- You're beautiful.

33:41.832 --> 33:45.082
- Thank you.

33:45.931 --> 33:46.931
- Love away.

33:48.650 --> 33:49.850
- We spoke on the phone.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.469
I'm Rudger Stanton.

33:52.470 --> 33:55.603
- I'm Danielle Smith.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.743
- You seem nervous.

33:59.610 --> 34:01.193
- That's because I am.

34:03.262 --> 34:05.643
- You don't have to do
anything you don't wanna do.

34:07.490 --> 34:10.090
- I don't really see anybody
doing much of anything.

34:11.090 --> 34:11.927
- It's early,

34:11.928 --> 34:14.603
and we're in the wrong
section of the house.

34:17.810 --> 34:19.853
Angel, this is, Danielle.

34:21.889 --> 34:23.103
- Pleasure to meet you.

34:23.963 --> 34:25.795
- If you'll excuse me.

34:30.177 --> 34:31.177
- Are you married?

34:32.030 --> 34:33.228
- I was.

34:33.230 --> 34:34.293
I'm with Rudger now.

34:36.330 --> 34:38.993
- Your husband did
he ever approve?

34:44.800 --> 34:48.958
So, how do we get started?

34:48.960 --> 34:51.208
- There's an initiation
when you're ready.

34:51.210 --> 34:53.089
- Should I have
brought my checkbook?

34:53.090 --> 34:54.599
- Not that kind.

34:54.600 --> 34:56.402
- It's a spiritual kind.

34:57.570 --> 34:59.347
We like to see things as they

35:00.410 --> 35:02.023
pertain for a rebirth.

35:04.030 --> 35:06.159
- But I'm agnostic.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.669
- It has nothing to
do with religion.

35:08.670 --> 35:12.079
Although I am partial to
the Buddhist's philosophy.

35:12.080 --> 35:17.080
No, we cater to
people's base needs,

35:19.810 --> 35:20.883
who we really are.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.923
If you'll follow us, please.

35:28.540 --> 35:32.417
Your body needs acknowledgement
just like your mind.

35:35.385 --> 35:38.707
You nourish your mind with
literature, music, or art.

35:43.370 --> 35:46.093
You have to nourish
your instincts too.

35:49.920 --> 35:51.649
- What about love?

35:51.650 --> 35:52.750
- It's all about love.

36:02.180 --> 36:03.180
- He did this?

36:05.410 --> 36:06.660
He fucked you, didn't he?

36:10.790 --> 36:11.830
I can't do this.

36:59.130 --> 37:01.403
I don't ever wanna talk
to you ever again.

37:03.090 --> 37:04.090
Fuck you.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.020
What do you think?

37:12.590 --> 37:15.409
- Remind me to never
get on your bad side.

37:15.410 --> 37:16.803
- Do you think it's a hoax?

37:19.110 --> 37:20.110
- I'm not sure.

37:21.160 --> 37:24.809
Yeah, a lot of early research
into this phenomenon

37:24.810 --> 37:26.363
had to be taken at face value.

37:29.570 --> 37:34.570
There was one other case
that was similar to yours

37:35.480 --> 37:36.679
that I was privy too myself,

37:36.680 --> 37:39.543
and that person didn't
have your ingenuity.

37:40.540 --> 37:41.640
They used a camcorder.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.379
No connection between
the two apparatus.

37:44.380 --> 37:45.659
Nobody could track the signal,

37:45.660 --> 37:48.423
and the recording
itself was rather weak.

37:49.365 --> 37:52.179
Other cases that seemed
legitimate at best,

37:52.180 --> 37:54.630
the person on the receiving
end usually described

37:56.260 --> 37:59.479
great winds that seemed
like they were coming

37:59.480 --> 38:01.349
from a very far, distant place.

38:01.350 --> 38:04.109
- That's exactly how I
would describe this.

38:04.110 --> 38:05.110
- Oh, I would too.

38:06.830 --> 38:09.139
- You thought I was a fraud.

38:09.140 --> 38:10.719
- I thought you were
hysterical broad

38:10.720 --> 38:12.670
with a very excentric
coping mechanism.

38:16.400 --> 38:19.293
- So how long does this
usually go on for?

38:20.960 --> 38:23.093
- Well, that really depends.

38:24.450 --> 38:25.929
There was one woman who reported

38:25.930 --> 38:29.073
to talk to her deceased
friend for about a year.

38:29.980 --> 38:31.949
- Is there any other way for
him to get in contact with me?

38:31.950 --> 38:34.423
- Well, it seems phone
is his device of choice.

38:35.460 --> 38:38.249
Of course, there's
many other avenues.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.929
You can put the television on

38:39.930 --> 38:41.969
the static black
and white channels

38:41.970 --> 38:43.999
like the little girl
in Poltergeist,

38:44.000 --> 38:45.369
it's always a fan favorite.

38:45.370 --> 38:48.969
Ouija, otherwise known
as the spirit board,

38:48.970 --> 38:51.260
recording electronic
voice phenomena

38:52.620 --> 38:54.370
whatever you feel
comfortable with.

38:56.912 --> 38:59.432
- Okay.

38:59.433 --> 39:00.763
So, what's next?

39:02.850 --> 39:03.850
- I'll track

39:04.950 --> 39:06.100
the origin of the call,

39:07.901 --> 39:11.999
and for now just try
to take note of

39:12.000 --> 39:14.400
how long the phone call
is, at what time of day.

39:16.730 --> 39:18.339
There's two reasons
why the deceased

39:18.340 --> 39:20.120
would wanna resume contact

39:22.120 --> 39:23.203
comfort and regret.

39:26.500 --> 39:28.550
With the unusual passing
of your husband,

39:30.400 --> 39:31.779
there could be a third.

39:31.780 --> 39:32.780
- Which is?

39:35.810 --> 39:37.448
- Revenge.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.220
You paint?

39:45.530 --> 39:47.443
- Um, yeah.

39:51.050 --> 39:52.953
- You mind if I take a look?

40:07.660 --> 40:10.279
These are incredible.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.417
Where'd you study?

40:12.830 --> 40:14.409
- I didn't.

40:14.410 --> 40:17.433
I just sort of
learned on my own.

40:21.560 --> 40:22.560
- What's next?

40:25.032 --> 40:26.365
- Good question.

40:27.373 --> 40:29.973
Just not really feeling
it these days.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.530
- Of course.

40:33.830 --> 40:36.249
- Jeremy always cheered me on,

40:36.250 --> 40:38.240
but now that he's gone.

40:40.350 --> 40:41.400
I don't know anymore.

40:43.510 --> 40:45.219
- Well, I don't know
shit about art,

40:45.220 --> 40:47.853
but these are pretty amazing.

40:50.390 --> 40:51.390
- Thank you.

41:02.180 --> 41:03.373
What did you forget?

41:08.270 --> 41:09.279
What are you doing here?

41:09.280 --> 41:12.409
- You didn't think the wig
fooled anybody, did you?

41:12.410 --> 41:13.243
I thought we could talk.

41:13.244 --> 41:14.259
- About what?

41:14.260 --> 41:16.303
- About Jeremy and you.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.060
- You're his ex-wife.

41:22.650 --> 41:25.469
- He didn't tell you
anything about me, did he?

41:25.470 --> 41:27.339
- No, nothing actually.

41:27.340 --> 41:28.739
- And you never asked.

41:28.740 --> 41:29.940
- It was never an issue.

41:30.970 --> 41:31.970
- Can I come in?

41:37.413 --> 41:38.413
Thank you.

41:41.775 --> 41:42.775
Cute place.

41:48.520 --> 41:49.719
So cozy.

41:49.720 --> 41:52.589
- You wanted to talk, talk.

41:52.590 --> 41:54.889
- I'm sorry about
the other night.

41:54.890 --> 41:58.509
I forget how it may
feel for someone new.

41:58.510 --> 42:00.010
It must have been so shocking.

42:01.009 --> 42:02.549
- I'm not a prude.

42:02.550 --> 42:03.850
- I didn't think you were.

42:06.110 --> 42:08.973
- I guess it was shocking.

42:09.949 --> 42:11.219
I mean I haven't kissed anybody

42:11.220 --> 42:13.459
but Jeremy in over six years.

42:13.460 --> 42:14.989
- That's terrible.

42:14.990 --> 42:16.173
You must be angry.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.600
- Why did he keep going?

42:21.610 --> 42:22.910
What did he get out of it?

42:25.550 --> 42:27.939
- We were only
married for a year.

42:27.940 --> 42:29.263
It was an intense year.

42:30.210 --> 42:33.763
But ultimately we had very
different ideas of marriage.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.900
Sex was another story.

42:38.400 --> 42:41.713
He kept going because it was
a safe place to experiment.

42:42.580 --> 42:46.089
For Rudger the act is
more about connectivity,

42:46.090 --> 42:48.340
reaching for a higher
state of consciousness.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.823
Not just for the kicks.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.019
- Why couldn't I be enough?

42:54.020 --> 42:55.759
- It's not that you
weren't enough.

42:55.760 --> 42:58.089
Jeremy put you on a pedestal.

42:58.090 --> 43:01.439
You were to be untouched and
unharmed by the rest of us.

43:01.440 --> 43:04.433
He couldn't imagine you with
anybody else, could you?

43:09.730 --> 43:13.099
- Wow, that's really fucking
hypocritical of him.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.079
- He talked about
you all the time.

43:15.080 --> 43:16.380
We were dying to meet you.

43:18.220 --> 43:19.390
- What do you want?

43:19.391 --> 43:20.773
- I want you to come back.

43:23.710 --> 43:25.209
- I don't think I'm
that kind of person.

43:25.210 --> 43:28.069
- Everybody says that
until they do something

43:28.070 --> 43:30.129
that they never
thought they could.

43:30.130 --> 43:32.239
You're going through
this all alone.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.440
We can be there for you.

43:35.340 --> 43:38.899
If not sexually, emotionally.

43:38.900 --> 43:40.419
We're always there for Jeremy.

43:40.420 --> 43:41.833
We can be the same for you.

43:43.140 --> 43:44.140
- I'm not alone.

44:09.384 --> 44:12.301
- I hope that you
change your mind.

44:32.870 --> 44:34.409
- Nothing at all.

44:34.410 --> 44:35.789
- Everybody checks out.

44:35.790 --> 44:38.989
Solid alibis, no motives,
not even rumors.

44:38.990 --> 44:42.017
But you did know that man
whose picture I sent you?

44:44.090 --> 44:46.773
- He's dating my
husband's ex-wife.

44:48.150 --> 44:50.509
- We weren't aware of the
personal connection.

44:50.510 --> 44:52.629
I didn't know you were
in touch with him.

44:52.630 --> 44:53.759
- I'm not.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.019
I just know.

44:55.020 --> 44:57.049
- Mrs. Tarver, even though
everybody checks out,

44:57.050 --> 44:59.259
it might be putting
yourself in serious danger.

44:59.260 --> 45:00.399
It's very possible that somebody

45:00.400 --> 45:02.227
outside the group
is targeting you.

45:03.320 --> 45:07.407
Either way it's not a good
idea to get involved.

45:08.524 --> 45:10.160
- I know.

45:10.161 --> 45:12.244
Thank you for the update.

45:21.501 --> 45:22.501
Jeremy.

45:23.378 --> 45:24.378
Jeremy.

45:26.346 --> 45:27.346
Jeremy.

45:31.428 --> 45:32.428
Jeremy.

46:10.936 --> 46:13.519
What are you trying to tell me?

46:14.360 --> 46:15.910
You're tying to drive me crazy?

46:19.230 --> 46:20.530
Are you trying to warn me?

46:25.910 --> 46:27.713
Should I go back
to Rudger's house?

46:30.050 --> 46:32.903
Jeremy, it's the only lead left.

46:35.260 --> 46:36.260
Are you jealous?

46:46.627 --> 46:48.229
- Hi.

46:48.230 --> 46:49.230
- Jeremy.

46:51.849 --> 46:52.696
- Hi.

46:52.696 --> 46:53.696
- Jeremy.

46:57.963 --> 46:58.963
Baby.

47:18.497 --> 47:20.053
- You're looking pretty good.

47:22.030 --> 47:24.403
- Thanks, I'm feeling better.

47:27.573 --> 47:28.573
- Thank you.

47:29.530 --> 47:32.073
So, I verified the connection,

47:33.320 --> 47:36.070
and it's definitely not coming
from a traceable source.

47:36.950 --> 47:38.500
It doesn't have a base station.

47:40.055 --> 47:41.629
- Phew.

47:41.630 --> 47:42.630
- In layman's terms

47:44.260 --> 47:46.160
it's not coming from
anything earthly.

47:47.430 --> 47:48.889
- Really.

47:48.890 --> 47:51.090
- You feeling scientifically
vindicated yet?

47:54.045 --> 47:55.679
- A little bit.

47:55.680 --> 47:57.329
- I just...

47:57.330 --> 47:59.293
This whole thing is incredible.

48:03.244 --> 48:05.194
I might have to write
a book about you.

48:07.070 --> 48:08.070
- Oh, really.

48:11.160 --> 48:14.963
- But then again I'd have to
spend a lot more time with you.

48:15.830 --> 48:17.784
You know, get to know
your back story and all.

48:17.785 --> 48:18.785
- Right.

48:24.238 --> 48:25.405
- I love Chai.

48:45.300 --> 48:47.049
- So glad you could make it.

48:47.050 --> 48:48.489
Drink.

48:48.490 --> 48:49.599
- Thank you.

48:49.600 --> 48:50.649
- It's perfect timing.

48:50.650 --> 48:53.283
Tonight is Nikita and
Victor's initiating night.

48:54.240 --> 48:55.369
- So what happens?

48:55.370 --> 48:56.653
- We sacrifice a virgin.

48:59.620 --> 49:00.620
Come.

49:04.420 --> 49:09.420
- Victor, Nikita we're happy
to have you in our midst.

49:10.200 --> 49:14.953
During our lives, we go through
several stages of existence.

49:16.880 --> 49:19.253
You are in samsara,

49:20.920 --> 49:25.483
a continuous flow
of life, death,

49:26.840 --> 49:27.840
and rebirth.

49:30.090 --> 49:31.423
By joining this family,

49:32.810 --> 49:37.810
you become part of a greater
spiritual consciousness.

49:40.100 --> 49:42.990
Are you ready to be born anew

49:45.770 --> 49:47.000
to start this day

49:48.710 --> 49:49.710
a new journey

49:52.120 --> 49:53.319
with this family?

49:53.320 --> 49:54.589
- Yes.

49:54.590 --> 49:55.423
- Yeah.

49:55.424 --> 49:58.489
- We welcome you.

49:58.490 --> 50:01.373
You're no longer mere seekers.

50:02.490 --> 50:03.967
But Dedicants.

53:18.114 --> 53:19.114
- Hello.

54:53.348 --> 54:54.348
Parker.

55:15.395 --> 55:16.809
- How are you doing?

55:16.810 --> 55:17.810
- Okay.

55:23.500 --> 55:25.959
- You said you got a phone call,

55:25.960 --> 55:29.309
some kind of warning
that woke you up.

55:29.310 --> 55:30.310
- Yes.

55:33.430 --> 55:34.430
What's that?

55:36.210 --> 55:38.973
- This is a very sophisticated
cellphone blocker,

55:39.890 --> 55:43.023
a modern day equivalent
of cutting wires.

55:44.340 --> 55:46.649
No calls could have
been made or received

55:46.650 --> 55:48.773
from any cellphones
in this house.

55:51.460 --> 55:52.719
- I guess not.

55:52.720 --> 55:54.423
- Maybe it was just an alarm.

56:00.973 --> 56:02.953
- I came as soon as I could.

56:02.954 --> 56:04.164
You okay?

56:04.165 --> 56:05.915
- Yeah, I'll be okay.

56:09.600 --> 56:11.793
Um, this is Detective Becker.

56:12.690 --> 56:14.875
- Hi, I'm Dennis.

56:14.876 --> 56:16.829
- He's a friend.

56:16.830 --> 56:17.867
- Nice to meet you.

56:20.020 --> 56:21.123
- Yeah, you too.

56:57.340 --> 56:58.340
I'm impressed.

57:03.610 --> 57:04.799
The phones were unplugged.

57:04.800 --> 57:06.963
I mean there's no
explanation to this.

57:09.660 --> 57:10.910
Once again I'm at a loss.

57:12.990 --> 57:14.406
You're painting again?

57:14.407 --> 57:16.002
- Trying to.

57:16.003 --> 57:17.003
Yeah.

57:18.235 --> 57:19.874
- That's good.

57:19.875 --> 57:22.042
I mean you're talented so.

57:28.730 --> 57:29.880
I don't think there's any

57:30.750 --> 57:33.353
good way of asking
you or good time.

57:34.690 --> 57:36.769
Do you wanna go
for a bite to eat

57:36.770 --> 57:39.563
or a coffee or something?

57:41.800 --> 57:42.800
- Yeah.

57:43.710 --> 57:44.710
Yeah, I'd like that.

57:45.757 --> 57:47.799
I mean don't I gotta eat, right?

57:47.800 --> 57:50.676
- That's good, it's
good to have to eat.

57:50.677 --> 57:51.963
I hear it's good for you.

57:54.230 --> 57:56.180
- Parker fell into a
coma this morning.

57:59.290 --> 58:00.799
- Did he say anything?

58:00.800 --> 58:02.919
- There was a bit
of a patent dispute

58:02.920 --> 58:06.319
over the quantum cryptography
communication's project

58:06.320 --> 58:08.699
with you as the beneficiary.

58:08.700 --> 58:11.079
Parker believed that
he was also entitled

58:11.080 --> 58:12.780
to at least half
of the ownership.

58:13.760 --> 58:16.539
He and your husband
had been heard

58:16.540 --> 58:18.823
and seen arguing
about it for months.

58:20.018 --> 58:21.759
- But why did he break
into the house?

58:21.760 --> 58:23.769
- He thought it
was here at home,

58:23.770 --> 58:25.579
and that you would
finally find it

58:25.580 --> 58:27.510
and file it on Jeremy's behalf

58:28.500 --> 58:30.869
unwittingly cutting
Parker out all together.

58:30.870 --> 58:33.903
- Do you think he had anything
to do with Jeremy's death.

58:36.150 --> 58:38.733
- He had the motive
and no alibi.

58:39.990 --> 58:42.623
- But what about the
markings, the castration?

58:43.490 --> 58:45.379
- Parker was close
enough to Jeremy to

58:45.380 --> 58:49.069
possibly know about his
extra-marital activities

58:49.070 --> 58:51.586
that and how some of
the members of the

58:51.587 --> 58:54.253
swinger's group were
killed in the past.

58:55.242 --> 58:57.379
- Just sounds a bit extreme

58:57.380 --> 59:00.303
to go through all
that for a patent.

59:01.311 --> 59:03.339
- For a communications
contract worth billions

59:03.340 --> 59:07.523
and billions of dollars people
have killed for a lot less.

59:09.690 --> 59:14.690
I think as far as Jeremy's
concerned, we found our man.

59:39.057 --> 59:40.057
- Jeremy.

59:46.064 --> 59:48.814
Jeremy, the police
caught Parker.

59:54.723 --> 59:57.140
You know how much I miss you.

01:00:02.675 --> 01:00:04.040
I have to move on.

01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.077
All those secrets
you kept from me.

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:16.603
I know you did it to protect me.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:21.823
I wish we could have been
honest about everything.

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:28.953
But I'm starting to understand
why you did what you did.

01:00:47.087 --> 01:00:48.087
I love you.

01:00:51.468 --> 01:00:53.218
I'll always love you.

01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:00.160
- Are you ready to be born anew

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.790
to live this day

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.773
your new journey
with this family?

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.960
- Yes.

01:01:12.322 --> 01:01:14.117
- Then we welcome you.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.763
You're no longer a mere seeker,

01:01:19.042 --> 01:01:20.292
but a Dedicant.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.080
- Orgasmic.

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.478
- Short, fleeting, and
not worth the effort.

01:01:44.479 --> 01:01:45.947
- Doesn't have to be.

01:01:45.948 --> 01:01:47.319
- You must be relieved, huh?

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:48.539
Now that they caught Parker.

01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:50.089
- He's still in a coma.

01:01:50.090 --> 01:01:51.769
- Do they know if he'll make it?

01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:52.770
- No idea.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.340
- Can I ask you something?

01:01:57.370 --> 01:02:00.433
How was it, burying
the cellphones?

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.309
- It wasn't easy.

01:02:03.310 --> 01:02:05.569
I mean part of me
wanted to hang onto it,

01:02:05.570 --> 01:02:07.949
but I knew it was the
right thing to do.

01:02:07.950 --> 01:02:10.199
- Yeah, and the patent?

01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.179
- The lawyers are finalizing.

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:13.399
NASA picked it up.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.979
It looks like a lot of money,

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.249
and, you know, now I can
put this all behind me

01:02:18.250 --> 01:02:20.393
and move on with my life.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:24.519
- I'm so proud of you.

01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:26.263
- Well, it's been a process.

01:02:29.262 --> 01:02:30.262
Uh-huh?

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:33.643
- Are you seeing anybody?

01:02:35.155 --> 01:02:36.009
- Sort of.

01:02:36.010 --> 01:02:38.149
- What sort of?

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:39.479
Come on that's all
you're gonna say?

01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.929
- Okay, okay, I know it's soon.

01:02:41.930 --> 01:02:43.069
- Yeah.

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:44.949
- His name is Dennis.

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:47.699
We're actually going on
our first date tonight,

01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.683
and I have to change but I have
something for you hold on.

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:53.690
- Okay.

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:02.749
Wow, you did this?

01:03:02.750 --> 01:03:04.189
- Yeah, I know it's different.

01:03:04.190 --> 01:03:08.462
- Yeah, it's not, you
know, how you usually...

01:03:10.070 --> 01:03:12.486
This is quite a statement.

01:03:12.487 --> 01:03:15.866
- It's intense I know.

01:03:15.867 --> 01:03:17.809
But I think it'll look
really good in the gallery.

01:03:17.810 --> 01:03:19.587
- Right, I'm gonna find a

01:03:21.630 --> 01:03:22.980
a really safe place for it.

01:03:24.785 --> 01:03:27.179
It's the new you, huh?

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.223
- It's the new me.

01:03:29.136 --> 01:03:31.013
- Okay, wow.

01:03:32.410 --> 01:03:33.410
- Closure.

01:04:14.965 --> 01:04:16.489
- Well, that was nice.

01:04:16.490 --> 01:04:17.699
- Yeah, I had a good time.

01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:18.810
- Yeah, so did I.

01:04:22.590 --> 01:04:24.390
- Maybe we can do
it again sometime?

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:27.630
- I'd like that.

01:04:30.476 --> 01:04:31.476
Well, huh.

01:04:51.450 --> 01:04:52.450
- Well.

01:04:54.120 --> 01:04:55.120
- I'll see you soon.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:57.150
- See you soon.

01:05:03.277 --> 01:05:05.170
- I thought you should know

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.690
Parker White died
this afternoon.

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:11.330
- I'm sorry.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:14.299
- There's been another homicide.

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.850
Her name was Nikita Washington.

01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:18.099
- Nikita.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:19.263
- Do you know her?

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.669
- How did she die?

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:23.979
- The some M/O as Jeremy

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:25.823
only this time
nobody interrupted.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.247
How exactly did you know her?

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.373
- I don't just the name.

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:36.689
- Please be safe.

01:05:36.690 --> 01:05:39.319
- Yes, I will.

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:40.370
Thank you, detective.

01:06:02.790 --> 01:06:04.233
- Poor, poor Nikita.

01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:07.183
- Someone's targeting us.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:10.800
- What do you mean?

01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:16.830
- Don't you see, Jeremy,
Nikita, Richard, and Claire?

01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:21.939
He removes their sexual organs.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.299
He makes fun of your philosophy

01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.263
by carving it into their skin.

01:06:26.410 --> 01:06:29.369
All of the victims have
been part of this group.

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.988
If it's not someone
within the group,

01:06:31.989 --> 01:06:33.749
it's someone watching us.

01:06:33.750 --> 01:06:35.229
- I'm not gonna change who I am

01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:36.709
because someone's
trying to scare us

01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:39.303
back into an age of
Victorian repression.

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:43.574
- Maybe we could not
meet for a while

01:06:43.575 --> 01:06:45.559
and let the police
handle things.

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.709
- Not meet I don't know what
that's gonna accomplish

01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:50.759
if he already knows who we are.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.280
- We can't act out of fear.

01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:54.969
I'm sorry I was eavesdropping.

01:06:54.970 --> 01:06:57.679
- Someone is targeting the
members of this group.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.899
I think acting out of fear
is a pretty smart idea.

01:07:00.900 --> 01:07:01.973
- But Angel's right.

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:05.390
Until we catch this
son of a bitch

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:09.283
we're no more safer alone
than we are together.

01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:16.290
- I'm sorry.

01:07:17.890 --> 01:07:18.963
I can't come back.

01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:22.023
- Maybe this isn't about you.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.893
Maybe it's about someone
else you care about.

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.743
Not very hard to figure out.

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.629
- No, I came here to warn you.

01:07:33.630 --> 01:07:35.213
It's too dangerous.

01:07:37.470 --> 01:07:38.470
I can't.

01:07:41.850 --> 01:07:45.293
I want you to know that I did
have a really good time,

01:07:46.550 --> 01:07:48.710
and I see why Jeremy
couldn't stay away.

01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:55.169
- I was hoping we were more
than a really good time.

01:07:55.170 --> 01:07:56.833
Maybe a family.

01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:00.550
- You were.

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.400
- I'm glad to hear that.

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:05.500
- I'm sorry.

01:08:08.969 --> 01:08:10.408
- I'm gonna miss you a lot.

01:08:10.409 --> 01:08:11.826
- Me too.

01:09:12.705 --> 01:09:13.705
- Okay.

01:09:14.777 --> 01:09:17.277
- Watch out for that...
- Tree.

01:09:19.312 --> 01:09:20.145
- Can't see can you?

01:09:20.145 --> 01:09:21.501
- I can see anything I promise.

01:09:21.502 --> 01:09:23.419
- All right, all right.

01:09:32.077 --> 01:09:35.209
- Dr. Dennis Freedman, who
would've thought you were

01:09:35.210 --> 01:09:37.323
capable of such grand gestures.

01:09:39.563 --> 01:09:41.063
- I surprise myself sometimes.

01:09:46.687 --> 01:09:47.854
- It's lovely.

01:09:49.010 --> 01:09:50.010
- You're lovely.

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.290
No, you didn't.

01:09:52.291 --> 01:09:54.292
- I totally did.

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:56.889
I stared at that screen
for like an hour.

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:59.520
Any one more minute and I
probably would've been sucked in.

01:09:59.521 --> 01:10:01.371
- Well, it's a great
movie, isn't it?

01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:05.039
I can't believe you
listened to me.

01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.290
- I always listen to you.

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:13.352
Look there's...

01:10:13.353 --> 01:10:16.913
There's something I
need to tell you.

01:10:18.415 --> 01:10:19.415
- Okay.

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:22.169
- It's just something I
did for a little while,

01:10:22.170 --> 01:10:24.899
and I think you should know.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:25.900
- All right.

01:10:26.940 --> 01:10:29.863
Whatever it is I'm
fine with it I'm sure.

01:10:31.287 --> 01:10:32.287
Bring it on.

01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:46.698
- Why are you people so hell
bent on making me do this?

01:10:46.699 --> 01:10:48.029
You're just like the rest of the

01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:51.863
repressed fucking
people in this world.

01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.929
How you find it so easy just to

01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:59.209
walk away from those that
you gave your word to.

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:03.079
- Is that why, because
they all wanted to leave?

01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:04.363
- Well, Nikita was weak.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.569
She just needed a call
from her Catholic father

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.799
to remind her of sin.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.299
Now Jeremy on the other hand
was a little different.

01:11:14.300 --> 01:11:16.959
See, he had a decade of devotion

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.683
and all of a sudden he
wanted to start a family.

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:23.069
- What are you talking about?

01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:26.639
- You agreed to have rebirth.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:28.553
We gave you rebirth.

01:11:29.770 --> 01:11:32.739
Now I'm gonna take it away.

01:11:32.740 --> 01:11:35.779
- Don't you think you should
disclose these house rules.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.059
Who in their right mind
would do any of this

01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:40.073
if the only out was
to be slaughtered?

01:11:41.230 --> 01:11:42.574
You're crazy.

01:11:45.785 --> 01:11:46.785
No.

01:11:53.839 --> 01:11:54.839
No.

01:11:56.785 --> 01:11:57.785
Wait, wait.

01:12:00.981 --> 01:12:01.981
- You bitch.

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:06.820
Who's here?

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.087
- It's Jeremy.

01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.093
- Jeremy's dead.

01:12:45.864 --> 01:12:46.955
- Last one.

01:12:46.956 --> 01:12:48.449
- This better be it.

01:12:48.450 --> 01:12:49.505
- It's not too heavy?

01:12:49.506 --> 01:12:52.373
- No, no, no I got it, okay.

01:12:52.374 --> 01:12:54.374
Oh, hi, detective, yeah.

01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.389
- Hi, there.

01:12:59.390 --> 01:13:00.255
- Hi.

01:13:00.256 --> 01:13:01.529
- I was just in
the neighborhood.

01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:03.372
Thought I'd stop and
