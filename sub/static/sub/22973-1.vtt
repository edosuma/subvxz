00:30.457 --> 00:32.916
Don't worry honey, the alarm is on.

00:33.624 --> 00:36.083
A squirrel would set it off.

00:36.749 --> 00:37.791
Are the police there?

00:38.582 --> 00:39.582
Look out the window.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.083
White car.

00:41.749 --> 00:42.958
Might be black.

00:43.958 --> 00:47.041
Stay calm, they have Asian officers now.

00:48.624 --> 00:51.624
I'm coming. You're safe, I swear.

00:51.874 --> 00:52.582
Thanks.

00:52.916 --> 00:54.250
We live in the suburbs,

00:54.292 --> 00:56.499
most dangerous thing is a tanning salon.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.417
Everything'll be fine.

00:59.833 --> 01:01.958
Massarelli isn't crazy.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.791
He wouldn't kill the prosecutor's wife.

01:19.292 --> 01:20.375
Marc, can you hear me?

01:20.416 --> 01:22.791
Côté is a witness, don't rough him up.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.125
I'm on it.

01:34.749 --> 01:35.791
Fuck you, Montreal!

02:21.749 --> 02:22.749
Côté!

03:02.167 --> 03:02.791
Out!

03:33.458 --> 03:34.583
Thanks, Jacques...

03:34.624 --> 03:36.374
Almost crushed our only witness,

03:36.416 --> 03:39.041
but the redneck method works!

03:39.083 --> 03:41.875
You think I'd harm a suspect?

03:41.916 --> 03:43.083
Hmm...

03:43.125 --> 03:44.499
yes, I do!

03:44.541 --> 03:47.499
I had it under control, you show-off!

03:47.541 --> 03:51.000
Oh! You wanted to arrest him yourself!

03:51.041 --> 03:52.167
Are you going senile

03:53.332 --> 03:55.624
or gathering stories for the nursing home?

03:55.666 --> 03:57.041
You want to feel alive?

03:57.083 --> 04:00.541
Get a hobby... Aquafit or something!

04:00.583 --> 04:01.958
You been snorting Red Bull?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.208
You're so 2009...

04:04.875 --> 04:07.291
Be cool, dude! We got him!

04:07.332 --> 04:09.374
Dude? You say dude?!

04:09.416 --> 04:10.791
You don't say dude!

04:10.833 --> 04:12.791
Yes I say dude. Alice?

04:12.833 --> 04:13.833
He says dude.

04:14.666 --> 04:15.666
You look ridiculous, Dad!

04:16.000 --> 04:18.875
Are you Simple Plan's bassist?

04:18.916 --> 04:21.125
He was escaping, I stopped him.

04:21.166 --> 04:21.833
Almost killed him!

04:23.666 --> 04:26.499
Nice, they're getting along better now!

04:27.000 --> 04:28.125
Enough!

04:28.167 --> 04:29.499
I'm trying to stay chill...

04:29.541 --> 04:31.125
You wanna fight? Bring it!

04:31.167 --> 04:32.041
You say chill?

04:32.083 --> 04:34.624
You're not licensed to chill!
You're unchill!

04:34.666 --> 04:35.958
I say chill!

04:36.000 --> 04:37.791
I say chill... you don't!

04:37.833 --> 04:39.332
Yes, I say chill!

04:42.167 --> 04:45.416
FATHER AND GUNS 2

04:46.666 --> 04:49.167
<i>Normand Massarelli, Montreal Mafia boss,</i>

04:49.207 --> 04:50.958
<i>was released this morning.</i>

04:51.000 --> 04:52.167
<i>No evidence connected him</i>

04:52.207 --> 04:53.791
<i>to the murder of Alain Gabourit,</i>

04:53.833 --> 04:57.291
<i>prosecutor for
the Organized Crime Commission.</i>

04:57.332 --> 04:58.791
This Commission bears my name.

04:58.833 --> 05:00.958
I will not be intimidated.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.624
Never!

05:02.666 --> 05:05.666
<i>The car bombing's key witness,</i>

05:05.708 --> 05:06.958
<i>Jean-François Côté,</i>

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
<i>refuses to cooperate.</i>

05:11.000 --> 05:13.125
We're tailing too many people,

05:13.167 --> 05:15.125
like Massarelli's hairdresser...

05:15.167 --> 05:17.125
He'll only give up his hair dye number.

05:17.167 --> 05:19.125
Let's stay on Capelli.

05:19.167 --> 05:21.167
Let's focus on his inner circle.

05:22.499 --> 05:24.166
Trying to steal my job?

05:24.666 --> 05:25.458
You bet.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.458
In 40 years of Mafia history,

05:27.499 --> 05:29.333
one guy was in every city

05:29.374 --> 05:32.125
during intimidation campaigns: Massarelli.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.000
Make sure Côté...

05:36.708 --> 05:39.333
Killing an attorney? This is insane!

05:39.374 --> 05:40.499
We're going too far!

05:57.207 --> 05:58.291
That's Martin Germain.

06:00.125 --> 06:02.042
Big fish in Hamilton. Why's he here?

06:02.750 --> 06:04.750
Jacques has no idea who he is.

06:04.791 --> 06:05.541
Really?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.791
I studied his case: 643 pages.

06:07.833 --> 06:09.541
He's murdered a lot of people.

06:09.583 --> 06:10.916
He's 6'3”.

06:11.291 --> 06:12.625
204 lbs.

06:12.666 --> 06:15.791
Now 197, give or take a few ounces.

06:15.833 --> 06:17.583
Eats right, drinks left.

06:17.625 --> 06:19.374
Washes hands before peeing.

06:19.416 --> 06:21.791
His cologne has a touch of bergamot.

06:21.833 --> 06:23.249
Makes his own mayo.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.249
Been dating Pascale Léveillée for 2 years,

06:25.291 --> 06:27.791
a waitress in a Polish restaurant

06:27.833 --> 06:30.708
in Hamilton Harbour's Chinatown.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.291
Grew up in Ahuntsic,

06:32.333 --> 06:34.042
moved to St-Leonard at 13.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.666
When angry, his right eye
is 10% smaller than his left,

06:36.708 --> 06:37.833
or vice-versa.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.750
He's nervous. He's ready to crack.

06:40.499 --> 06:42.583
He even switched deodorant.

06:43.625 --> 06:45.750
He's always used Gillette Glacier Cool.

06:45.791 --> 06:48.750
Switched to Axe body spray, Twin pack.

06:50.082 --> 06:50.917
It's a sign!

06:51.750 --> 06:53.333
You went through his garbage?!

06:54.666 --> 06:55.583
A little bit.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.875
Imagine my dad's reaction
when he finds out

06:58.917 --> 07:01.750
we can nail Massarelli with a guy he's
never seen.

07:01.791 --> 07:03.791
He'll fall off his chair!

07:03.833 --> 07:05.166
Yeah, sure...

07:06.458 --> 07:09.625
Hey buddy. You don't want to talk?

07:11.416 --> 07:13.082
Jean-François Côté...

07:14.249 --> 07:17.291
Car theft, extortion, kidnapping,

07:18.082 --> 07:20.249
gangsterism. Great!

07:20.625 --> 07:22.791
You just need first degree murder!

07:22.833 --> 07:24.000
I told you.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.833
I was running from the explosion.

07:28.583 --> 07:29.583
Listen.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.625
Let's make a deal.

07:32.625 --> 07:33.583
Give me Massarelli

07:33.625 --> 07:36.291
and the Queen will give you a big check.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.249
I don't know Massarelli.

07:40.458 --> 07:41.166
You don't?

07:41.625 --> 07:42.917
Oh you don't!

07:43.958 --> 07:46.124
You blew up the prosecutor!

07:46.166 --> 07:47.333
You can't touch me!

07:47.374 --> 07:48.541
I know.

07:49.541 --> 07:51.666
Jacques is the only guy who can play

07:51.708 --> 07:53.666
good cop-bad cop by himself.

07:53.708 --> 07:56.374
If I hit you, and I don't want to,

07:56.416 --> 07:57.708
you might bruise,

07:58.875 --> 08:01.541
but you just had a car accident...

08:02.416 --> 08:03.082
Here!

08:04.333 --> 08:06.000
That's the bulldozer.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.041
The steering.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.166
That's the airbag.

08:09.208 --> 08:10.666
Damn airbags!

08:11.041 --> 08:11.833
Sorry.

08:12.374 --> 08:14.041
I don't like being violent.

08:15.708 --> 08:16.666
You think I like it?

08:17.041 --> 08:18.666
I don't.

08:18.708 --> 08:20.208
You had a difficult childhood.

08:21.666 --> 08:23.166
It makes me sad.

08:23.208 --> 08:25.374
We don't like sad.

08:26.208 --> 08:28.875
Give me something and the sad stops!

08:29.708 --> 08:30.833
Hey, dude...

08:32.666 --> 08:34.041
You know me, dude?

08:34.332 --> 08:36.166
I'm the great Jacques Laroche.

08:36.207 --> 08:38.332
I arrested Fripon Tanguay in 2008.

08:38.707 --> 08:40.500
Check out my shiny tattoos,

08:40.541 --> 08:41.416
dude.

08:54.875 --> 08:55.666
Uh...

08:57.708 --> 09:00.041
Confirmed our reservation for tomorrow.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.583
8:30 at the restaurant.

09:04.041 --> 09:05.249
Don't wanna go?

09:06.208 --> 09:07.500
Not really...

09:08.416 --> 09:09.208
Why not?

09:09.249 --> 09:12.041
It'll be 3 hours of Martin Germain talk.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.208
We won't talk about him.

09:15.249 --> 09:16.416
He might've gained weight.

09:17.082 --> 09:17.833
We should discuss it.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.541
It's our anniversary...

09:21.041 --> 09:22.082
I know.

09:22.999 --> 09:24.208
I should study.

09:24.249 --> 09:26.416
I swear we won't talk about him.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.333
I love watching him work.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.708
I've gathered enough intel for Jacques.

09:39.666 --> 09:40.957
Can't wait to see his face

09:40.999 --> 09:43.333
when I tell him our guy is...

09:43.374 --> 09:44.291
Martin Germain

09:44.333 --> 09:45.500
is our man.

09:50.374 --> 09:53.374
Martin Germain:
Massarelli's new lieutenant.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.625
Extremely dangerous.

09:55.666 --> 09:58.041
Linked to 10 murders in Ontario.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.625
Insufficient evidence for arrest.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.374
According to Côté, they're at odds:

10:02.416 --> 10:03.833
Germain didn't want

10:03.875 --> 10:05.374
the prosecutor killed.

10:05.416 --> 10:06.625
Not to brag,

10:06.666 --> 10:08.833
but Côté spilled his beans quickly.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.249
Germain's ready to quit.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.833
The girlfriend's made him soft.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.750
He's ready to talk, now.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.999
Côté is like Fripon Tanguay in 2008:

10:25.375 --> 10:27.124
I've got him by the balls.

10:27.166 --> 10:28.833
He'll testify against Germain.

10:28.874 --> 10:30.458
Feeling trapped, Germain

10:30.500 --> 10:32.124
will clear his conscience

10:32.166 --> 10:33.541
and give us Massarelli.

10:39.166 --> 10:39.999
Where's the prisoner?

10:40.833 --> 10:41.792
Jesus...

10:41.833 --> 10:43.208
Christ!

10:43.249 --> 10:44.916
We've lost the suspect.

10:52.667 --> 10:54.124
You piece of garbage!

10:54.166 --> 10:56.166
We told you to shut up!

10:56.667 --> 10:58.625
Getting cozy with the cops?

10:58.667 --> 10:59.792
I didn't tell them anything.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.291
You drank tea and talked retirement plans?

11:02.333 --> 11:03.667
Martin, please!

11:03.708 --> 11:05.166
Think about my kid!

11:06.541 --> 11:07.500
Please!

11:12.041 --> 11:12.999
Get out of here!

11:23.667 --> 11:25.625
<i>The Minister must resign.</i>

11:25.667 --> 11:27.999
<i>The police lost Côté,</i>

11:29.166 --> 11:30.999
<i>their only suspect!</i>

11:32.541 --> 11:34.333
<i>Incompetent morons!</i>

11:38.208 --> 11:40.832
<i>Man looking for woman between 18 and 50</i>

11:42.583 --> 11:43.541
<i>0 messages</i>

12:10.124 --> 12:10.916
Cuba!

12:13.750 --> 12:16.083
That Michael Jackson impersonator?

12:16.124 --> 12:18.375
Tiny Korean woman screaming:

12:19.999 --> 12:21.083
She was wearing shorts.

12:21.124 --> 12:22.583
Michael Jackson in shorts?

12:23.041 --> 12:24.375
The worst was the camping trip.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.458
The old man peeping on us
with his binoculars.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.375
Pretending to look at the sky
when we caught him.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.541
He was cockwatching...

12:32.583 --> 12:34.083
Sure, the horny-tologist.

12:35.625 --> 12:36.667
Remember?

12:36.708 --> 12:38.791
My joke: the horny-tologist.

12:39.375 --> 12:40.291
You were right,

12:40.333 --> 12:41.791
this is a nice change.

12:42.541 --> 12:44.083
Laughing helps me relax.

12:44.999 --> 12:47.916
I'm stressed with work and school.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.916
At least my advisor is good.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.416
Have I met him?

12:54.999 --> 12:55.832
Sure!

12:56.166 --> 12:57.250
A few times.

12:58.458 --> 12:59.416
Paul Grégoire.

13:00.958 --> 13:02.291
I remember, Paul Grégoire.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.250
He's good.

13:04.916 --> 13:06.791
Project management is so broad.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.916
It's easy to get lost.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.916
Focusing on law enforcement...

13:14.791 --> 13:15.916
...helps.

13:26.916 --> 13:28.333
I'll try to stay calm.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.999
Why the hell is Massarelli behind me?

13:33.416 --> 13:34.166
Listen...

13:36.916 --> 13:38.250
Boris Bistro was full.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.542
This is Massarelli's favorite restaurant.

13:40.583 --> 13:41.749
Clues are everywhere:

13:42.291 --> 13:44.083
who he hangs out with.

13:44.958 --> 13:47.166
To his right, Tony Capri, 36,

13:47.208 --> 13:49.833
10 years for attempted murder, single...

13:49.874 --> 13:51.208
What's my advisor's name?

13:51.250 --> 13:52.250
Jean Dufour.

13:56.250 --> 13:58.458
My short-term memory sucks,

13:58.500 --> 13:59.749
I'll remember in the morning.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.833
We've talked about this,

14:01.874 --> 14:03.083
you're not here.

14:03.542 --> 14:04.999
You're obsessed with your job.

14:05.041 --> 14:05.999
Exaggerate much?

14:06.416 --> 14:07.874
We're spending our anniversary

14:07.916 --> 14:10.749
with Montreal's head mobster.

14:11.041 --> 14:12.250
We're falling apart.

14:13.874 --> 14:15.166
I thought this dinner would...

14:15.208 --> 14:16.208
Falling apart?

14:16.250 --> 14:17.041
We are!

14:17.874 --> 14:18.707
Since when?

14:18.749 --> 14:19.791
Where are you?

14:19.833 --> 14:21.166
Here with you.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.250
Even when you're here,

14:23.999 --> 14:24.791
you're not.

14:24.833 --> 14:26.999
I can't be more here than this!

14:27.041 --> 14:28.707
You're here, but you're not here.

14:28.749 --> 14:29.958
What?

14:29.999 --> 14:32.542
I'm the police department's Houdini?

14:33.208 --> 14:35.041
Wanna see how great we're doing?

14:36.666 --> 14:37.500
Here!

14:44.874 --> 14:46.041
Did you just...

14:47.166 --> 14:49.542
You chucked a ring to prove we're good.

14:49.874 --> 14:51.125
I didn't chuck it.

14:51.166 --> 14:51.999
Chucked it.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.375
Like a dirty Kleenex.

14:54.416 --> 14:56.166
I was going to kneel.

14:58.833 --> 15:01.333
I'll start over: Alice, my love...

15:17.375 --> 15:18.666
<i>Hey, Geneviève.</i>

15:19.041 --> 15:21.791
You're my ex and I can talk to you.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.458
We're friends, though you never call...

15:24.500 --> 15:27.041
<i>Give me one word to describe</i>

15:27.582 --> 15:29.958
the problem with our relationship,

15:29.999 --> 15:31.624
why we broke up?

15:31.666 --> 15:32.833
Be honest...

15:33.417 --> 15:34.041
Jacques.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.624
My father...?

15:37.666 --> 15:40.083
Ever take Alice to Massarelli's bars?

15:41.250 --> 15:42.500
Why would I do that?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.999
To find a clue

15:44.833 --> 15:47.624
that would impress Jacques?

15:47.666 --> 15:48.958
Enough about Jacques.

15:48.999 --> 15:51.166
I called to talk about our break-up.

15:51.500 --> 15:52.958
Exactly.

15:52.999 --> 15:53.958
What?

15:53.999 --> 15:56.500
<i>With us, it was like you were there...</i>

15:57.833 --> 15:58.874
<i>but not there.</i>

16:00.208 --> 16:01.208
<i>Helpful?</i>

16:02.166 --> 16:04.458
<i>While the Commission
is still investigating,</i>

16:04.500 --> 16:06.291
<i>the home of judge Solange Bourgault</i>

16:06.333 --> 16:07.500
<i>has been destroyed by a fire.</i>

16:07.541 --> 16:09.458
<i>No one was hurt.</i>

16:09.500 --> 16:11.458
The Commission will go on,

16:11.500 --> 16:13.666
it is out of the question

16:14.166 --> 16:16.958
that criminals influence
the judicial process.

16:16.999 --> 16:17.958
Thank you.

16:17.999 --> 16:19.166
As Justice Minister,

16:19.208 --> 16:20.833
I look incompetent right now.

16:20.874 --> 16:21.958
Right now?

16:21.999 --> 16:23.833
You might not be the man for the job.

16:23.874 --> 16:25.624
We could force retirement.

16:25.666 --> 16:26.624
Really?

16:26.666 --> 16:28.000
Know how many ministers

16:28.041 --> 16:30.958
have come and gone in my career? 14.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.125
Cowardly, dickless, corrupt,

16:33.166 --> 16:35.291
idiots, liars, alcoholics,

16:35.333 --> 16:36.500
one coke head.

16:36.541 --> 16:39.499
Once we got a competent one,
it blew our minds!

16:41.499 --> 16:42.666
We found something.

16:42.708 --> 16:44.958
Cabinet is pressuring me.
You have 2 weeks.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.083
2 weeks? You might be gone by then.

16:49.499 --> 16:51.791
You won't believe this.

16:53.582 --> 16:55.333
<i>I don't know you.</i>

16:55.375 --> 16:58.083
<i>I've never met your coworkers!</i>

16:58.125 --> 16:59.958
<i>You disappear for days!</i>

17:00.000 --> 17:01.000
<i>What do you do?</i>

17:01.874 --> 17:03.291
<i>I can't tell you.</i>

17:03.333 --> 17:04.833
I wouldn't know you were cheating

17:04.874 --> 17:07.040
if I hadn't caught you with those 2 sluts.

17:07.083 --> 17:08.749
It was a meaningless mistake.

17:08.790 --> 17:09.958
Meaningless?!

17:10.708 --> 17:11.958
I'll cheat on you,

17:12.000 --> 17:13.208
you'll understand meaningless!

17:13.250 --> 17:14.333
Babe, what can I...

17:14.375 --> 17:15.499
Stop hiding things from me!

17:15.540 --> 17:17.125
They're the only 2!

17:17.165 --> 17:18.208
It was a threesome.

17:18.250 --> 17:20.375
<i>You're such an idiot!</i>

17:20.416 --> 17:22.040
How can I make amends?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.416
Talk to me!

17:25.165 --> 17:26.165
I love you, babe.

17:26.208 --> 17:26.958
I love you too.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.457
She's got him hooked.

17:35.666 --> 17:37.624
I found this couples therapy.

17:37.666 --> 17:38.708
It's that or it's over.

17:38.749 --> 17:40.250
We've been to therapy.

17:40.292 --> 17:41.541
This one is different.

17:42.666 --> 17:44.375
<i>It's more physical.</i>

17:45.457 --> 17:47.916
It's called Bootcamp for Couples.

17:47.958 --> 17:49.708
<i>Bootcamp for Couples...</i>

17:49.749 --> 17:51.292
<i>The promise of a new beginning.</i>

17:51.333 --> 17:53.041
<i>Come back from the edge</i>

17:53.083 --> 17:55.499
<i>with celebrity psychologists.</i>

17:57.250 --> 17:58.708
<i>A memorable week</i>

17:58.749 --> 18:00.916
<i>in isolation with other couples</i>

18:00.958 --> 18:03.125
<i>who wish to rekindle the flame.</i>

18:03.166 --> 18:04.125
<i>Bootcamp for Couples,</i>

18:04.166 --> 18:06.375
<i>where caring rhymes with daring.</i>

18:06.416 --> 18:07.791
Christ.

18:13.666 --> 18:15.375
We're going undercover at your bootcamp.

18:15.416 --> 18:16.708
No way!

18:16.749 --> 18:19.125
Martin Germain,
Massarelli's new lieutenant.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.541
He's signed up.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.292
He's ready to cooperate.

18:23.499 --> 18:26.250
It's our best chance to catch Massarelli.

18:26.292 --> 18:28.000
Therapy doesn't work that way!

18:28.333 --> 18:29.416
You have no clue!

18:29.457 --> 18:32.583
We've done therapy. It was great.

18:33.083 --> 18:33.958
Not bad.

18:34.000 --> 18:35.791
We followed the program.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.457
It helped, right, Marc?

18:38.000 --> 18:38.958
Not for long.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.208
I think our relationship improved.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.333
For you.

18:42.916 --> 18:44.624
Massarelli is unscrupulous.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.958
He controls Quebec's drug trade.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.541
He burns down judges' houses,

18:48.583 --> 18:50.041
blows up attorneys.

18:50.083 --> 18:51.166
No!

18:51.208 --> 18:53.208
I won't be involved!

18:53.916 --> 18:55.374
Here's something...

18:55.416 --> 18:57.875
Show me burnt houses, dead kids.

18:58.208 --> 18:59.166
I've made up my mind.

18:59.208 --> 19:00.416
Take a look.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.166
You're the star!

19:04.041 --> 19:05.583
What are you stealing?

19:06.416 --> 19:08.041
A blow-up doll? Oh my!

19:10.333 --> 19:11.208
I didn't steal.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.875
You took it for a test drive...

19:16.041 --> 19:17.833
It's like a reality show

19:17.875 --> 19:19.416
about low self-esteem.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.875
What would your patients think?

19:24.208 --> 19:25.666
<i>I'm buying it!</i>

19:25.708 --> 19:27.583
And the College of Psychologists?

19:28.208 --> 19:31.000
YouTube loves these videos.

19:31.041 --> 19:32.292
It'd go viral.

19:32.332 --> 19:34.250
Fine, you bastards!

19:36.208 --> 19:37.332
I'll help you,

19:37.374 --> 19:38.624
on one condition:

19:38.666 --> 19:40.125
the couples registered

19:40.167 --> 19:41.875
because it was urgent.

19:42.541 --> 19:44.167
Their pain is real.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.416
Therapy must go as planned.

19:47.416 --> 19:49.208
We won't interfere.

19:49.833 --> 19:51.208
We'll focus on Germain.

19:51.250 --> 19:53.541
At least, you're a credible gay couple.

19:54.000 --> 19:54.875
No!

19:55.541 --> 19:56.875
We won't be the couple.

19:57.374 --> 19:58.541
We could.

19:59.041 --> 20:00.791
Or not... ever!

20:00.833 --> 20:02.624
It would be unusual...

20:02.666 --> 20:05.125
Something no one wants to imagine.

20:05.167 --> 20:06.208
Sure, okay.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.374
We have a real couple.

20:09.833 --> 20:10.958
He won't be there.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.916
Alice and I will go undercover.

20:13.499 --> 20:16.208
You do the therapy, for real.

20:17.875 --> 20:19.041
Do you have...

20:19.083 --> 20:20.749
issues to resolve?

20:27.374 --> 20:28.499
Is this a joke?

20:28.541 --> 20:31.000
Everyone knows we have problems, but me?

20:31.708 --> 20:32.416
I don't...

20:32.708 --> 20:34.875
Kev, what do you know?

20:36.167 --> 20:37.499
Uh, I dunno...

20:38.708 --> 20:40.541
Alice is tired, y'know,

20:41.041 --> 20:43.083
she's working and studying.

20:43.833 --> 20:47.125
She needs her boyfriend's support,

20:47.875 --> 20:51.167
to feel important, uh... all that stuff.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.416
You're just not there.

20:55.875 --> 20:57.249
I'm totally there.

20:58.332 --> 21:00.374
You talking behind my back?

21:01.249 --> 21:02.624
I told no one.

21:02.666 --> 21:03.458
- Really?
- Nope.

21:03.499 --> 21:04.624
Why does everybody know?

21:04.666 --> 21:06.624
Even Kev!

21:06.666 --> 21:08.791
I didn't tell them. It's obvious

21:08.833 --> 21:10.208
to everyone but you.

21:10.249 --> 21:11.666
That's the fucking problem!

21:15.499 --> 21:16.374
You'll do great.

21:26.208 --> 21:28.208
Welcome to Bootcamp for Couples.

21:28.708 --> 21:31.083
Isolation forces you to bond

21:32.416 --> 21:34.708
on a path to a healthy relationship.

21:34.750 --> 21:36.374
I'm your guide,

21:37.374 --> 21:39.708
with my assistant, Jacques.

21:40.708 --> 21:43.207
We saw a woman in the video?

21:44.791 --> 21:46.042
Where is she?

21:46.083 --> 21:48.207
She had personal issues. But...

21:48.249 --> 21:50.332
Jacques is a great psychologist.

22:12.499 --> 22:13.750
Chill tattoos!

22:16.249 --> 22:17.624
You say chill?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.958
This hotel was closed.

22:24.458 --> 22:25.916
They've reopened for us.

22:25.958 --> 22:28.499
There's water damage in one room.

22:29.458 --> 22:31.083
With 6 couples

22:31.125 --> 22:34.458
and 5 rooms, one couple has to go.

22:34.833 --> 22:36.125
With full refund.

22:36.166 --> 22:38.291
What is this? Big Brother?

22:38.958 --> 22:40.083
Not much I can do.

22:40.125 --> 22:41.916
We'll go.

22:41.958 --> 22:43.458
Enjoy! Come on.

22:44.499 --> 22:45.458
Don't move!

22:50.458 --> 22:51.916
How thoughtful!

22:51.958 --> 22:54.083
You can save your relationship too.

22:54.125 --> 22:55.083
No, no!

22:55.125 --> 22:56.458
Want to leave?

22:56.499 --> 22:58.124
Fine. Let's go back!

22:59.166 --> 23:00.416
It's over between us!

23:00.458 --> 23:02.083
Let's stay then.

23:02.124 --> 23:03.416
I can't take this!

23:03.458 --> 23:04.416
He cheated on me...

23:04.458 --> 23:06.625
with two girls... at the same time!

23:06.666 --> 23:08.083
I want to do this.

23:08.124 --> 23:09.416
Excuse me?

23:09.458 --> 23:10.583
I want to do this.

23:10.625 --> 23:11.666
You do?

23:12.666 --> 23:13.958
You'll do the exercises?

23:14.791 --> 23:16.625
Good. We're staying!

23:16.958 --> 23:18.291
Figure it out.

23:18.333 --> 23:20.166
We want to stay too.

23:20.958 --> 23:23.124
Marie-Claude has zero libido.

23:23.166 --> 23:24.875
A croissant makes me wet.

23:26.458 --> 23:27.458
Come on!

23:27.499 --> 23:30.207
I can't use the showerhead forever.

23:30.249 --> 23:31.583
You can!

23:31.958 --> 23:33.583
I'll even watch.

23:34.083 --> 23:35.666
That's not what I want!

23:35.708 --> 23:36.875
Wonderful!

23:38.166 --> 23:40.875
Akim, Élissa, why do you need therapy?

23:43.207 --> 23:44.499
We're 25.

23:45.291 --> 23:47.082
We have a 1-year-old.

23:50.042 --> 23:52.042
You're straight out of a therapy ad.

23:52.374 --> 23:54.541
Who votes the burnout parents in?

23:56.416 --> 23:57.374
Therapy for you!

24:00.458 --> 24:02.458
Geneviève and I are professionals,

24:02.499 --> 24:04.042
we've been retired for a year.

24:04.625 --> 24:06.541
Married 30 years,

24:06.583 --> 24:08.000
separated a few times,

24:08.042 --> 24:09.708
but we're giving it one last try.

24:09.750 --> 24:11.249
The tone of his voice,

24:11.291 --> 24:13.708
how he pronounces every syllable...

24:16.000 --> 24:17.166
Stop enumerating!

24:17.208 --> 24:18.458
Don't interrupt me!

24:21.374 --> 24:23.666
We're here because Carole will leave me.

24:23.708 --> 24:25.416
No, Gaël, you'll leave me.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.875
I'd never leave you.

24:27.917 --> 24:29.499
You'll find a girl your age.

24:29.541 --> 24:31.666
I want you so much it hurts.

24:31.708 --> 24:34.333
I love your skin, your breasts,

24:34.374 --> 24:36.082
your hips.

24:37.416 --> 24:39.458
You can't fake that.

24:40.374 --> 24:41.499
That's not love.

24:41.541 --> 24:44.166
Sex 10 times a week means nothing.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.291
Well...

24:46.374 --> 24:48.291
Don't go for 11 just now.

24:48.708 --> 24:50.791
Everything looks cool for you.

24:51.249 --> 24:52.000
She's right.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.875
We're in a lousy relationship.

24:54.917 --> 24:56.041
So lousy,

24:56.625 --> 24:58.374
everyone knew it was bad but me.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.249
We're real-estate agents.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.750
I only talk about work.

25:02.791 --> 25:04.333
Condos, sheds, bungalows,

25:04.374 --> 25:06.374
duplex, triplex, all the plexes!

25:07.541 --> 25:09.875
I also manage to be there,

25:09.917 --> 25:12.082
but not there. It's a superpower.

25:12.124 --> 25:13.500
Marc is like Happy,

25:13.541 --> 25:14.875
the dwarf in Snow White:

25:15.291 --> 25:16.541
?Life is grand!

25:16.583 --> 25:18.583
I only talk about work!”

25:18.625 --> 25:20.291
I miss out on everything.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.541
We all work too much.

25:22.541 --> 25:25.166
When together, we're not together!

25:26.666 --> 25:28.416
Maybe it's time to put

25:28.458 --> 25:31.124
my <i>for sale</i> sign on another man's lawn?

25:31.166 --> 25:32.792
Oh, hurtful metaphor!

25:33.166 --> 25:35.958
Sorry, you'll have to drag me away.

25:36.833 --> 25:38.333
That can be arranged.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.666
We're doing the goddamn therapy!

25:42.458 --> 25:44.124
We're staying too, got it?

25:44.166 --> 25:45.958
No one hates each other more than us.

25:45.999 --> 25:47.416
We'll kill each other!

25:47.458 --> 25:48.917
You should go.

25:48.957 --> 25:50.583
You and your little problems...

25:50.625 --> 25:51.666
Should I kill him?

25:51.708 --> 25:53.792
You're taking a loving couple's spot!

25:53.833 --> 25:54.999
Wasn't talking to you.

25:55.041 --> 25:56.792
Watch your tone!

25:56.833 --> 25:57.625
Want to fight?

25:57.666 --> 25:58.333
Anytime!

26:13.999 --> 26:14.792
Congratulations.

26:14.833 --> 26:16.333
That was the first exercise.

26:19.583 --> 26:20.917
Jesus Christ!

26:20.957 --> 26:22.416
Participants' introduction.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.625
Getting to know each other.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.291
You're eager to work.

26:27.333 --> 26:28.957
There's room for everyone.

26:40.792 --> 26:43.625
Bunch of lunatics, right, Happy?

26:45.291 --> 26:46.583
Why are you here?

26:46.625 --> 26:48.666
To get Martin Germain to talk.

26:49.458 --> 26:51.083
That's our job.

26:51.124 --> 26:53.333
Forget the mission,
focus on your relationship.

26:53.375 --> 26:54.416
Forget the mission?

26:54.458 --> 26:57.166
Saving your relationship
will be demanding.

26:57.208 --> 26:59.124
That's why I'm here.

26:59.625 --> 27:01.500
To keep an eye on me?

27:01.875 --> 27:02.957
You don't trust me.

27:03.500 --> 27:04.541
You don't!

27:06.500 --> 27:08.458
At your age, fading out isn't a big deal.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.583
It's normal.

27:09.625 --> 27:12.333
You can't let go. Makes you take risks.

27:12.375 --> 27:13.916
I know what I'm doing.

27:13.957 --> 27:14.750
So do I.

27:14.792 --> 27:17.208
Martin Germain will be
eating out of my hand.

27:17.249 --> 27:19.541
Martin Germain will eat out of my hand!

27:19.583 --> 27:20.999
Out of my hand...

27:25.500 --> 27:26.957
He won't eat out of yours,

27:26.999 --> 27:29.916
he'll be stuffed after eating from mine.

27:29.957 --> 27:33.124
You won't have enough.
He'll come to my hand.

27:34.792 --> 27:36.625
Alice will eat where?
My other hand!

27:37.667 --> 27:38.583
Watch me work.

27:38.625 --> 27:39.916
I'm watching.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.792
Take notes and get them tattooed.

28:02.667 --> 28:03.667
What are you doing?

28:04.957 --> 28:06.750
I'm taking the couch.

28:06.792 --> 28:08.625
That's what fighting couples do.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.957
I'm playing the part.

28:10.999 --> 28:12.958
Stop exaggerating!

28:12.999 --> 28:14.792
We'll mix up our stories.

28:15.792 --> 28:16.750
I wasn't.

28:16.792 --> 28:17.999
Fine.

28:18.333 --> 28:20.333
I'm putting my sign here!

28:21.708 --> 28:22.500
Goodnight.

28:25.874 --> 28:27.124
You're being ridiculous.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.333
Why?

28:30.375 --> 28:31.416
It's 8:30.

28:33.375 --> 28:34.541
Jacques is waiting.

28:43.041 --> 28:44.208
So...

28:45.124 --> 28:46.041
I just...

28:46.083 --> 28:47.500
Let's be clear...

28:49.625 --> 28:50.541
I love you,

28:50.583 --> 28:51.416
y'know.

28:52.124 --> 28:53.250
It's...

28:55.041 --> 28:56.208
I, uh... I love you...

28:57.541 --> 28:58.750
by the way.

28:59.124 --> 29:00.250
I'm in love and...

29:00.832 --> 29:01.541
all that...

29:03.166 --> 29:04.041
a lot.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.124
Me too.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.583
Stop flirting with the therapist.

29:16.708 --> 29:18.916
What are you talking about?!

29:19.958 --> 29:21.083
You're crazy.

29:21.124 --> 29:23.375
True, it turns me on to see a man

29:23.416 --> 29:25.541
speak more than 2 words an hour.

29:28.375 --> 29:30.166
Being attracted to your therapist

29:30.208 --> 29:31.416
is called transference.

29:32.375 --> 29:33.791
The shrink's too short anyway.

29:34.124 --> 29:35.583
I'm not into midgets.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.291
It's like he left his legs in Montreal.

29:39.749 --> 29:41.958
What about his assistant?

29:44.208 --> 29:47.500
He's handsome, doesn't mean
I'd sleep with him.

29:47.542 --> 29:49.041
You're one to talk!

29:49.458 --> 29:50.874
I didn't do a thing.

29:51.208 --> 29:52.083
Transference.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.208
Anyway, Jacques must be 128!

29:56.542 --> 29:57.832
I'd never kiss a man

29:57.874 --> 29:59.500
who was there on D-Day,

29:59.542 --> 30:02.416
wrinkled like a prune...

30:02.458 --> 30:03.667
He's pretty wrinkly.

30:03.707 --> 30:04.832
Dyes his hair more than me.

30:04.874 --> 30:06.916
He has Viagra-breath.

30:09.041 --> 30:11.208
He's Amy Winehouse's great-grandfather.

30:11.250 --> 30:13.041
Explains the tattoos.

30:13.707 --> 30:15.166
His first girlfriend was Shirley Temple.

30:15.208 --> 30:15.916
Really?

30:15.958 --> 30:17.291
She was really kinky.

30:17.791 --> 30:19.083
Enough.

30:19.124 --> 30:20.999
He was there when the Titanic sank...

30:22.208 --> 30:23.166
That's you!

30:23.208 --> 30:24.916
He knew Jesus.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.625
He was at the Last Supper.

30:27.375 --> 30:28.583
This is perfect.

30:28.625 --> 30:29.833
Transference!

30:30.333 --> 30:31.583
Goddammit!

30:31.625 --> 30:33.833
Where's the off button?

30:33.874 --> 30:35.291
Don't help me!

30:52.500 --> 30:53.999
Gotta love 'em, huh?

30:56.208 --> 30:57.291
Our girlfriends...

30:59.208 --> 31:00.833
Going to therapy.

31:02.041 --> 31:03.333
It's so girly.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.542
Hold on a sec...

31:09.208 --> 31:10.500
Out of my hand!

31:14.166 --> 31:17.125
Show us how you perceive your partner.

31:17.166 --> 31:18.999
I call this Living Sculptures.

31:19.625 --> 31:22.625
You will sculpt your partner into a shape

31:23.375 --> 31:26.707
that best represents them and explain why.

31:28.874 --> 31:30.791
If Jacques and I were partners

31:30.833 --> 31:32.999
and I thought he was grouchy...

31:38.125 --> 31:39.791
This is Suzanne.

31:40.707 --> 31:42.125
She protects me.

31:43.833 --> 31:44.999
You're beautiful!

31:45.041 --> 31:46.166
Isn't she?

31:46.208 --> 31:49.791
Since Marie-Claude's lost her sex drive...

31:51.833 --> 31:53.833
This is how I see her.

32:02.542 --> 32:04.125
Seeing it moves me.

32:10.333 --> 32:11.333
I love you.

32:14.999 --> 32:16.291
Beautiful.

32:17.333 --> 32:18.333
Touching.

32:19.125 --> 32:20.833
Ladies and gentlemen, Akim.

32:24.291 --> 32:26.458
Since the baby was born,

32:26.500 --> 32:28.833
he's become the Invisible Man.

32:30.375 --> 32:32.125
Very funny.

32:32.791 --> 32:33.833
Fucking hilarious!

32:34.542 --> 32:36.542
We've been together for 10 years.

32:37.624 --> 32:40.874
She was outgoing, happy.

32:42.125 --> 32:43.291
Now this.

32:43.333 --> 32:44.958
We had a baby, dumb-ass.

32:44.999 --> 32:45.958
There's the proof.

32:45.999 --> 32:47.166
Stop exaggerating, idiot.

32:47.208 --> 32:48.624
Seriously, shut the hell up.

32:48.666 --> 32:49.999
See?

32:50.041 --> 32:52.166
Stop! Why are you laughing?

32:52.208 --> 32:54.166
You're a statue!

32:54.208 --> 32:55.458
Statues don't hit!

32:55.500 --> 32:56.916
You're revolting.

32:56.958 --> 32:58.958
I can't believe I let you inside me.

32:58.999 --> 33:01.874
I tore, they sewed me up, you fainted...

33:03.666 --> 33:04.916
Asshole!

33:04.958 --> 33:06.291
Hear that echo?

33:09.125 --> 33:10.541
To me, Marc is...

33:11.958 --> 33:12.833
Happy.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.624
Happy lives in his own world,

33:14.666 --> 33:16.541
doesn't see reality.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.333
He thinks our relationship is...

33:19.166 --> 33:20.333
peachy.

33:20.916 --> 33:22.417
Super positive.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.291
Even when knee-deep in it.

33:28.958 --> 33:30.458
This is Alice.

33:30.499 --> 33:31.749
Fantastic.

33:31.791 --> 33:32.958
What does it mean?

33:33.458 --> 33:34.458
Nothing.

33:34.499 --> 33:36.166
It's funny to see her struggling.

33:37.166 --> 33:38.791
She seems stable, but...

33:39.333 --> 33:40.291
she's not.

33:41.291 --> 33:43.791
The image burned into my brain:

33:52.166 --> 33:53.125
There you have it.

33:53.791 --> 33:55.916
This is not how I see Geneviève,

33:55.958 --> 33:57.833
but how I'd like her to be.

34:04.499 --> 34:08.083
Bernard's narcissism is best showcased

34:08.125 --> 34:10.292
in a position

34:11.292 --> 34:13.166
which allows him to fellate himself.

34:16.456 --> 34:18.833
This isn't how I perceive Gaël,

34:20.250 --> 34:21.958
but how I feel him.

34:39.498 --> 34:41.083
We've seen enough!

34:41.708 --> 34:42.623
Let them be!

34:42.666 --> 34:43.791
They're fully participating.

34:44.333 --> 34:45.708
Hush, Édouard!

34:46.623 --> 34:48.583
Go on, Gaël.

34:49.208 --> 34:51.873
Want us to make love in front of you?

34:52.708 --> 34:54.125
Wouldn't be a first.

34:57.250 --> 34:59.958
Time to find your inner caveman.

35:03.499 --> 35:06.166
I want you to act like primitive couples.

35:06.208 --> 35:08.666
Communicate only through grunts.

35:10.791 --> 35:13.292
Rediscover your partner

35:14.250 --> 35:16.292
as if for the first time.

35:18.791 --> 35:20.292
I want to see seduction

35:21.125 --> 35:22.958
in its most primitive form.

35:23.624 --> 35:24.875
No words!

35:26.708 --> 35:27.416
Goddammit!

35:29.208 --> 35:29.916
Get away!

35:32.541 --> 35:33.541
Really?

35:51.541 --> 35:52.749
You stupid idiot!

35:59.041 --> 36:00.583
Almost the same vocabulary.

36:14.208 --> 36:15.041
Stop!

36:15.708 --> 36:16.374
Help!

36:28.541 --> 36:29.374
You're crazy!

36:30.833 --> 36:31.499
Help!

36:32.666 --> 36:35.458
Men, you're hunter-gatherers,

36:35.499 --> 36:37.749
you must feed your partner

36:37.791 --> 36:39.875
while protecting her from predators.

36:41.125 --> 36:41.958
Right.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.125
A T-rex attacks.

36:44.958 --> 36:47.167
He's attacking right now!

36:49.167 --> 36:51.958
Dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years

36:52.000 --> 36:53.292
before humans appeared.

36:53.332 --> 36:54.374
It's just a game.

36:55.374 --> 36:56.458
It doesn't matter...

36:56.499 --> 36:57.292
There's a bear!

36:57.791 --> 36:58.499
A bear!

36:58.541 --> 36:59.541
I swear!

37:02.499 --> 37:03.332
There's a fucking bear!

37:14.958 --> 37:16.499
Scream, come on!

37:36.666 --> 37:37.958
How comforting!

37:39.332 --> 37:40.458
My back!

37:42.332 --> 37:43.041
Don't touch me!

37:45.125 --> 37:47.167
I fell, but I'm fine.

37:48.291 --> 37:49.291
It's all good.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.042
Gentlemen, congratulations!

37:55.833 --> 37:58.000
To Suzanne, our real hero!

37:59.291 --> 38:01.624
Men used to be men,

38:01.666 --> 38:03.833
now they can't even do that.

38:03.875 --> 38:06.416
You smothered our primal urges

38:06.458 --> 38:10.000
so we could be in touch with our emotions.

38:10.042 --> 38:12.208
When I see a bear, my emotions flare up!

38:12.791 --> 38:14.958
Like in bed. One minute,

38:15.000 --> 38:17.291
they want it rough enough to break a rib,

38:17.332 --> 38:20.000
then, they want you to recite Shakespeare.

38:21.791 --> 38:23.750
We don't have sex anymore.

38:23.791 --> 38:25.624
I'll never have sex again.

38:26.000 --> 38:27.583
He doesn't understand me.

38:27.624 --> 38:29.416
He's not there.

38:29.458 --> 38:31.000
The baby is, even when I poop.

38:31.791 --> 38:33.583
I don't like pooping with an audience.

38:33.624 --> 38:35.624
I do all the housework

38:35.666 --> 38:37.583
while you sit on your ass.

38:37.624 --> 38:38.583
I breastfeed!

38:38.624 --> 38:40.916
Ladies and gents, she breastfeeds!

38:40.958 --> 38:42.583
She's a mother, she breastfeeds.

38:42.624 --> 38:43.750
Female monkeys climb trees

38:43.791 --> 38:46.416
with 8 babies feeding off their nipples.

38:46.458 --> 38:49.416
You can't even get a glass of water.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.416
If I could touch your breasts.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.624
Kid's on my boobs 18 hours a day.

38:53.666 --> 38:55.958
On my breaks, I want them to myself.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.333
She used to love my penis!

38:59.958 --> 39:01.458
Now it's her nemesis.

39:02.291 --> 39:04.750
But my penis is resilient.

39:04.791 --> 39:06.083
My penis is like...

39:06.125 --> 39:07.624
a Tibetan monk:

39:08.291 --> 39:10.791
he doesn't speak, he's patient and bald.

39:10.833 --> 39:12.291
But don't upset him.

39:12.333 --> 39:15.416
You wanna bang me screaming my name?

39:15.458 --> 39:18.166
I'd have an orgasm not hearing my name.

39:18.708 --> 39:20.750
24 hours. Total silence.

39:22.416 --> 39:23.583
If I had a dildo,

39:23.625 --> 39:25.958
I'd shove it in my ear to block sound.

39:26.000 --> 39:27.166
You'd need 2 dildos.

39:28.791 --> 39:30.958
We also don't make love.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.625
I feel no desire for Bernard.

39:32.916 --> 39:33.666
None.

39:34.125 --> 39:35.625
I hate seeing him naked.

39:35.666 --> 39:37.000
We get it.

39:37.666 --> 39:38.625
I hate it too.

39:40.541 --> 39:43.000
How does one boost their sex drive?

39:43.625 --> 39:46.207
Well... everyone's different.

39:46.249 --> 39:48.042
There's no difference.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.166
No sex is the same problem

39:50.207 --> 39:52.499
for 2 women or a normal couple.

39:53.249 --> 39:55.416
What do you suggest?

39:55.458 --> 39:57.541
Stop worrying, just do it!

39:57.583 --> 39:58.625
Simple as that.

39:59.458 --> 40:00.875
He understands.

40:00.917 --> 40:02.374
Just do it!

40:02.416 --> 40:04.541
If you or your wife don't feel like it,

40:05.207 --> 40:06.458
jump on it.

40:06.499 --> 40:09.166
Take her and, y'know, soon enough...

40:09.207 --> 40:10.458
That's rape!

40:10.958 --> 40:13.541
It's not rape if you're a couple.

40:15.083 --> 40:18.083
What you said about real men and women,

40:18.124 --> 40:19.750
sensitivity and emotions...

40:21.583 --> 40:23.499
Let's say it like it is.

40:23.541 --> 40:26.541
A man is male, a woman is female.

40:26.875 --> 40:29.833
Males have penises, females vaginae.

40:29.875 --> 40:33.207
At some point,
the penis goes into the vagina.

40:35.583 --> 40:37.333
Do you approve of his methods?

40:37.374 --> 40:38.416
They're not my methods,

40:38.458 --> 40:40.374
but it is one school of thought.

40:40.416 --> 40:41.374
Exactly, it's...

40:42.291 --> 40:43.708
Pre-Freud.

40:44.291 --> 40:46.208
Pre-thought itself.

40:47.458 --> 40:49.875
Sex has to go back to basics.

40:51.708 --> 40:54.875
If men breastfed, there'd be world peace.

41:05.958 --> 41:07.000
This isn't easy.

41:07.042 --> 41:08.541
It's challenging.

41:12.124 --> 41:14.249
Our relationship or the mission?

41:14.625 --> 41:15.541
The mission.

41:17.124 --> 41:18.041
You?

41:19.124 --> 41:20.041
Same thing.

41:21.917 --> 41:23.917
We should focus on the case.

41:24.708 --> 41:27.416
We can't fix everything.

41:28.291 --> 41:29.583
Sure we can!

41:30.541 --> 41:31.708
I'll bet on it.

41:32.708 --> 41:34.708
$100. When we leave,

41:35.208 --> 41:37.041
Germain will have spilled his guts

41:37.082 --> 41:38.708
and you'll be nuts about me.

41:44.708 --> 41:45.791
Easy money.

42:08.708 --> 42:11.041
Oh? The grunt of the scared caveman?

42:11.082 --> 42:13.500
I thought you were behind me.

42:13.541 --> 42:15.041
We were holding hands!

42:15.082 --> 42:16.583
It was Édouard's hand...

42:16.625 --> 42:18.500
Very delicate hands.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.500
We have to cancel the therapy.

42:26.291 --> 42:27.875
I can't get up.

42:29.208 --> 42:30.500
We just started!

42:30.541 --> 42:33.124
I can't, physically or psychologically!

42:35.208 --> 42:36.124
I have to cancel.

42:36.875 --> 42:38.291
I'll stand in for him.

42:38.833 --> 42:41.249
We'll get some cortisone.

42:41.291 --> 42:42.416
You can't replace him.

42:42.458 --> 42:43.458
No! You...

42:44.792 --> 42:45.792
I'll be the shrink!

42:45.833 --> 42:47.208
You won't.

42:48.291 --> 42:49.999
You think like an old cop.

42:52.833 --> 42:55.666
They'll know you're not a psychologist.

42:56.500 --> 42:57.583
Why?

42:57.625 --> 42:59.458
You don't have one ounce of psychology.

42:59.875 --> 43:01.957
I infiltrated Apache Poitras's gang,

43:01.999 --> 43:03.833
we became best friends.

43:03.875 --> 43:06.083
You think I didn't use psychology?

43:06.124 --> 43:08.166
Yes, Apache Poitras psychology.

43:08.208 --> 43:10.374
This is Marie-Claude and Suzanne.

43:10.833 --> 43:12.583
He tried to scalp me twice.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.124
You think 2 lesbians scare me?

43:14.166 --> 43:15.333
Exactly.

43:15.374 --> 43:17.500
Can you gently address

43:17.541 --> 43:20.249
the libidos of a suburban gay couple?

43:20.291 --> 43:22.249
He who can do more can do less.

43:23.458 --> 43:25.374
Ask the guy who built the pyramids

43:25.416 --> 43:26.957
if he can build a shed.

43:28.124 --> 43:29.625
You just compared lesbians to a shed...

43:30.458 --> 43:31.957
It's a metaphor!

43:32.957 --> 43:34.375
You understood?

43:35.625 --> 43:37.625
You're a hero cop,

43:37.666 --> 43:39.124
but we'll find a better solution.

43:40.541 --> 43:41.333
Any ideas?

43:43.041 --> 43:44.875
I'll blow your cover!

43:45.291 --> 43:46.625
Wanna see something?

43:57.124 --> 43:58.625
Édouard is seriously injured,

43:58.666 --> 44:01.166
he won't be able to continue.

44:03.458 --> 44:05.625
I'm taking over.

44:07.500 --> 44:08.625
In a few days,

44:08.666 --> 44:10.500
you'll present a dance routine.

44:10.541 --> 44:13.166
On each iPad, there's a choreography.

44:14.208 --> 44:15.041
Here.

44:16.041 --> 44:18.667
You'll work on different concepts.

44:19.999 --> 44:22.833
Cooperation, touch, synchronicity,

44:23.957 --> 44:25.583
sensuality and...

44:26.999 --> 44:28.083
communication.

44:28.124 --> 44:29.083
Focus!

44:29.124 --> 44:30.625
Stop checking Akim out.

44:31.291 --> 44:32.750
What?!

44:32.792 --> 44:34.249
There's no need to rewind.

44:34.291 --> 44:36.124
- Rewind!
- Do it yourself!

44:38.291 --> 44:39.833
You'll dance with the damn iPad?

44:40.792 --> 44:42.291
The tension is rising!

44:42.333 --> 44:43.583
Can't stand those two.

44:43.625 --> 44:44.792
Jacques!

44:45.957 --> 44:48.083
We both have low self-esteem,

44:48.124 --> 44:50.416
we feel unworthy of each other's love.

44:50.458 --> 44:52.333
No. It's simple,

44:52.792 --> 44:54.792
the age gap is too large.

44:54.832 --> 44:56.124
Think about it.

44:57.124 --> 44:58.583
Off to bed.

44:58.625 --> 45:00.916
- We can do it.
- Forget the choreography.

45:00.958 --> 45:02.458
Sleep therapy.

45:02.792 --> 45:04.291
Off to bed!

45:05.792 --> 45:06.625
Ridiculous.

45:09.792 --> 45:11.458
You're doing good.

45:12.124 --> 45:14.458
Oh yeah, you have no desire
for each other.

45:14.958 --> 45:17.291
Suzanne, if we waited for women,

45:17.333 --> 45:18.916
we'd never get anywhere.

45:18.958 --> 45:21.083
It's up to us men to take the lead.

45:22.083 --> 45:24.291
You're the man here... You should...

45:24.333 --> 45:25.041
Excuse me?!

45:25.083 --> 45:27.124
Women love conquerors.

45:27.166 --> 45:29.667
Did he just say I'm the man here?

45:30.958 --> 45:33.625
If there's no man,
no wonder there's problems.

45:33.667 --> 45:34.708
I'll slug him!

45:34.750 --> 45:36.541
Not very feminine of you.

45:39.999 --> 45:41.208
The cute couple.

45:41.250 --> 45:42.708
Move on.

45:43.750 --> 45:46.375
You know what your problem is?

45:46.874 --> 45:47.667
If I may?

45:47.708 --> 45:48.874
You may not!

45:48.916 --> 45:50.541
Let's hear him.

45:51.874 --> 45:53.791
You have an attention deficit.

45:53.832 --> 45:54.708
You're not there.

45:54.750 --> 45:55.541
He's not.

45:55.583 --> 45:57.083
I know.

45:57.124 --> 45:58.667
Your girlfriend wants to tango

45:58.708 --> 46:00.791
and Happy is goofing around.

46:01.541 --> 46:03.999
Grab her and tango away already!

46:06.625 --> 46:07.874
How are things here?

46:07.916 --> 46:09.458
Martin won't dance.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.583
I've never danced before.

46:12.208 --> 46:13.999
Who gives a shit?!

46:14.041 --> 46:15.999
Martin, I get it,

46:16.041 --> 46:17.832
but today, it's dance therapy.

46:19.166 --> 46:20.458
Allow me.

46:30.542 --> 46:31.749
Are you kidding me?

46:32.916 --> 46:34.708
Screw her on the dancefloor.

46:34.749 --> 46:37.667
He's teaching us the steps.

46:37.708 --> 46:39.083
The steps to get in your pants!

46:41.250 --> 46:43.791
Time for a private session.

46:49.208 --> 46:51.375
In my spare time...

46:55.041 --> 46:56.416
I can't do it.

46:56.458 --> 46:59.041
Just spit it out, dammit!

46:59.542 --> 47:01.707
Take your time.

47:05.208 --> 47:06.667
I'm not ready.

47:06.707 --> 47:09.500
Quit it with the? Not ready”.

47:09.542 --> 47:10.874
Jacques, chill out!

47:11.707 --> 47:14.208
Martin needs an individual session.

47:14.250 --> 47:15.707
Can you leave us?

47:16.458 --> 47:17.707
I'd rather stay.

47:17.749 --> 47:19.542
I'm the therapist.

47:19.583 --> 47:22.250
I'm here to help him open up.

47:22.291 --> 47:23.916
Trust my methods,

47:23.958 --> 47:25.667
go practice your cha-cha-cha.

47:37.333 --> 47:38.500
You know...

47:39.125 --> 47:40.833
honesty is essential.

47:43.833 --> 47:46.583
What are you hiding from Pascale?

47:46.625 --> 47:48.208
That's blunt.

47:49.208 --> 47:50.958
Tell me your secret.

47:50.999 --> 47:51.791
I'd rather not.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.833
You'd better or else...

47:53.874 --> 47:55.125
Are you threatening me?

47:55.166 --> 47:57.542
Yes. Therapeutic threats.

47:59.166 --> 48:00.125
I don't like this.

48:02.375 --> 48:03.416
Let's try another method.

48:03.458 --> 48:04.542
Come closer.

48:07.166 --> 48:08.500
Look into my eyes.

48:14.375 --> 48:15.833
That's part of the therapy?

48:18.500 --> 48:19.333
How do you feel?

48:19.833 --> 48:21.624
Surprised and my face stings.

48:23.250 --> 48:24.666
Still therapy?

48:25.749 --> 48:26.458
New method.

48:27.624 --> 48:28.958
Scandinavian.

48:29.874 --> 48:31.624
It's for your own good.

48:31.999 --> 48:34.458
Tell me what you're keeping from Pascale.

48:34.833 --> 48:36.417
You have to open up.

48:36.458 --> 48:38.208
Set yourself free.

48:38.707 --> 48:39.749
It's time.

48:39.791 --> 48:40.874
Open up.

48:41.291 --> 48:42.458
Open up!

48:43.375 --> 48:44.333
Is that open enough?

48:45.500 --> 48:46.624
Should I open up more?

48:46.666 --> 48:48.125
Yes! Even more!

48:52.041 --> 48:53.458
This feels good!

48:53.958 --> 48:55.624
I love the Scandinavian method!

49:00.458 --> 49:01.291
You're right.

49:01.958 --> 49:04.291
Amazing method. Spill it.

49:04.333 --> 49:05.749
Isn't it enough?

49:05.791 --> 49:07.125
No!

49:07.166 --> 49:08.624
Set yourself free!

49:09.375 --> 49:10.916
Talk!
I can't.

49:10.958 --> 49:12.791
Excuse me, Jacques? I just...

49:13.666 --> 49:14.500
I really...

49:15.125 --> 49:16.791
need some advice about Alice.

49:17.958 --> 49:19.125
I can't do this.

49:21.333 --> 49:22.958
You've really outdone yourself.

49:22.999 --> 49:24.125
You're beating our witness up.

49:24.166 --> 49:26.458
You told Suzanne she's the man.

49:26.500 --> 49:27.458
I'm speechless.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.250
It's obvious she's the man!

49:29.291 --> 49:31.083
Call a spade a spade?

49:31.125 --> 49:33.125
She even walks like a man!

49:33.166 --> 49:35.083
Psychologists have a bit of restraint.

49:35.125 --> 49:36.749
That's the problem.

49:36.791 --> 49:39.250
You have to look competent.

49:39.291 --> 49:40.791
On active listening:

49:42.624 --> 49:45.125
don't give advice, don't judge.

49:45.458 --> 49:47.624
They have to feel that you hear them.

49:47.958 --> 49:49.458
I'm not deaf.

49:52.166 --> 49:54.458
Hearing their emotions.

49:55.291 --> 49:58.083
Getting someone to open up.

49:58.125 --> 49:59.791
Like an interrogation.

50:00.958 --> 50:01.791
Without the slapping.

50:02.833 --> 50:04.000
It's simple:

50:04.458 --> 50:05.500
be receptive,

50:07.624 --> 50:09.166
repeat what they're saying

50:09.458 --> 50:12.125
and nod, while saying: Mmm-hmm.

50:12.458 --> 50:14.666
I'll do patient and therapist.

50:18.125 --> 50:20.582
My lover no longer desires me.

50:22.499 --> 50:24.166
Your lover no longer desires you.

50:25.250 --> 50:26.666
I get it.

50:26.708 --> 50:28.666
I repeat their statement and say:? Mmm.”

50:28.708 --> 50:31.708
Not just? Mmm.” An interested? Mmm-hmm.”

50:41.333 --> 50:42.582
Talk with your eyes.

50:50.791 --> 50:51.541
A bit more.

50:53.000 --> 50:53.749
Less.

50:54.624 --> 50:55.458
With compassion.

50:56.166 --> 50:56.874
Empathy.

51:00.083 --> 51:01.208
Are you in pain?

51:02.582 --> 51:03.708
Start low, end high.

51:06.457 --> 51:07.125
What's that face?

51:09.457 --> 51:11.250
You sound like a horny bull.

51:14.041 --> 51:15.166
Loosen it up.

51:16.125 --> 51:16.833
Not as tight.

51:18.000 --> 51:18.791
Good.

51:20.874 --> 51:22.083
Hold on to that.

51:22.791 --> 51:23.791
Next step.

51:24.916 --> 51:25.958
You've got it.

51:27.791 --> 51:28.541
Enough.

51:32.417 --> 51:33.541
Can you be serious?

51:34.375 --> 51:36.208
Can you take me seriously?

51:37.041 --> 51:38.541
We don't have to compete.

51:39.208 --> 51:40.208
We could cooperate.

51:43.624 --> 51:45.375
We're a team.

51:47.749 --> 51:49.708
I want you to see what I'm capable of.

51:51.375 --> 51:52.416
It matters to me.

51:54.375 --> 51:55.708
It matters to you.

51:57.250 --> 51:58.375
Go to hell.

52:03.958 --> 52:06.083
Those who suffer from vertigo, get ready!

52:06.125 --> 52:07.875
We're rock climbing!

52:18.292 --> 52:19.457
My legs hurt.

52:21.125 --> 52:22.292
Are we lost?

52:23.292 --> 52:24.875
No. We're almost there.

52:38.541 --> 52:40.583
Do you know where the rock face is?

52:41.374 --> 52:42.167
Of course.

52:42.208 --> 52:44.708
We've already been here.

52:46.374 --> 52:49.416
It looks similar, but it's different.

52:50.041 --> 52:51.125
You seem lost.

52:51.457 --> 52:52.791
I'm not lost.

52:53.541 --> 52:54.292
Really?

52:54.708 --> 52:56.708
Where's the rock face then?

52:56.749 --> 52:58.250
Not far.

52:58.916 --> 52:59.916
You...

53:01.208 --> 53:02.208
You...

53:02.250 --> 53:03.374
I don't get you.

53:03.749 --> 53:04.583
Me either.

53:05.208 --> 53:08.041
The rock face is just around the corner!

53:08.708 --> 53:11.208
Rock climbing: the steep ascent.

53:11.583 --> 53:13.000
This is about trust:

53:13.041 --> 53:14.916
your partner will help you climb.

53:15.624 --> 53:17.416
I can touch the peak.

53:21.624 --> 53:22.916
Sure...

53:22.958 --> 53:24.833
This is bullshit!

53:26.332 --> 53:27.292
You're angry.

53:27.332 --> 53:28.332
Fuck you!

53:30.666 --> 53:32.666
Next activity.

53:35.833 --> 53:37.332
This exercise

53:37.374 --> 53:39.416
will help you understand

53:39.458 --> 53:42.041
how your relationship with your parents

53:43.167 --> 53:44.791
affects your lovelife.

53:44.833 --> 53:47.000
Your parents are your first love...

53:48.167 --> 53:50.791
Talk about your mother... or father.

53:57.499 --> 53:59.041
I grew up alone with my mother.

53:59.624 --> 54:01.624
We had no money. She had 3 jobs.

54:01.666 --> 54:03.624
I did all the housework.

54:03.958 --> 54:05.958
She taught me responsibility.

54:07.332 --> 54:08.416
Impressive.

54:08.458 --> 54:10.833
No. I was dealing weed at 11.

54:13.958 --> 54:15.624
My dad was strict.

54:17.624 --> 54:18.791
Violent.

54:19.291 --> 54:21.624
My brother and I called him? The mime.”

54:21.916 --> 54:24.624
He didn't talk much,
but he used his hands.

54:25.416 --> 54:26.916
Élissa scares me too.

54:27.167 --> 54:28.499
When we talk...

54:28.541 --> 54:30.833
it's like walking on eggshells.

54:30.875 --> 54:32.125
Crystal eggshells.

54:33.374 --> 54:34.708
Just looking at her scares me.

54:35.458 --> 54:36.833
I'm also scared of Élissa.

54:36.875 --> 54:38.499
You see?

54:38.833 --> 54:41.541
It's not easy to talk about this.

54:43.499 --> 54:45.624
My mother never touched me.

54:46.167 --> 54:48.374
She was not affectionate.

54:49.666 --> 54:51.541
She made me feel ugly.

54:51.958 --> 54:54.125
I read somewhere that for a child,

54:54.167 --> 54:56.291
not being touched is like torture.

54:57.875 --> 54:59.458
So my mother was ISIS.

55:02.042 --> 55:03.624
And my house, Guantanamo.

55:05.791 --> 55:07.833
That's why you won't go to Cuba.

55:13.167 --> 55:14.708
My mom had me at 49.

55:15.708 --> 55:17.291
I breastfed until grade 3.

55:21.291 --> 55:23.291
I grew up with cows.

55:24.416 --> 55:25.624
I learned a lot from them.

55:26.624 --> 55:27.458
Peacefulness,

55:28.083 --> 55:29.958
patience, digestion.

55:35.458 --> 55:37.125
Fond memories.

55:38.291 --> 55:40.583
My mother died when I was young.

55:40.624 --> 55:41.958
It affected me.

55:43.125 --> 55:43.958
Thanks.

55:44.291 --> 55:46.291
Thank you, Marc. Carole?

55:46.333 --> 55:47.458
Just a second.

55:48.125 --> 55:49.833
You were raised by your dad?

55:50.624 --> 55:52.583
Yes. I'd rather not get into it.

55:52.624 --> 55:54.333
No pressure.

55:58.625 --> 56:00.125
He doesn't want to share.

56:01.625 --> 56:03.791
Like I said, she died when I was young,

56:04.291 --> 56:07.000
and my dad was away for work.

56:07.833 --> 56:09.583
He left me with a nanny

56:09.625 --> 56:11.291
from the Philippines.

56:12.499 --> 56:15.958
Cerila only spoke Filipino. I learned it.

56:19.958 --> 56:22.249
Which in little-kid language means:

56:22.833 --> 56:24.499
?Where's Daddy? I miss him.”

56:25.875 --> 56:28.833
Cerila pitied me, insisted we play catch.

56:28.875 --> 56:30.791
My dad never played catch.

56:32.791 --> 56:34.958
Ever play catch with a Filipino nanny?

56:37.499 --> 56:38.166
She'd say...

56:41.666 --> 56:43.583
?Come, let's play catch.”

56:45.875 --> 56:46.625
I'd reply:

56:51.124 --> 56:53.042
It means:? Where's my dad?

56:53.083 --> 56:54.750
I'd rather play with him.”

56:55.875 --> 56:56.625
She'd say:

57:00.458 --> 57:01.416
?He's at work.”

57:03.000 --> 57:05.207
I didn't exist for him.

57:05.958 --> 57:07.374
He spoke in monologues.

57:07.416 --> 57:08.833
Your dad's a self-centered jerk!

57:09.166 --> 57:09.958
Damn right.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.166
Thanks for sharing.

57:11.207 --> 57:13.917
Whatever I accomplish, it's never enough.

57:13.958 --> 57:16.000
Thank you very, very much.

57:16.499 --> 57:17.249
Excellent.

57:17.291 --> 57:18.875
Let's move on...

57:18.917 --> 57:20.291
My dad was an asshole too.

57:21.583 --> 57:23.499
He'd beat my mother and me.

57:23.541 --> 57:25.124
We weren't allowed to talk.

57:25.416 --> 57:27.583
When I was 5, he gave me a dog.

57:27.625 --> 57:28.875
A few months later he...

57:30.082 --> 57:31.124
he killed it

57:31.583 --> 57:33.416
looking me straight in the eyes.

57:39.124 --> 57:40.374
Well done, love.

57:49.042 --> 57:50.458
Thanks for sharing.

57:51.208 --> 57:52.208
Feels good, huh?

57:53.374 --> 57:57.042
Anything you'd like to get off your chest,

57:57.082 --> 57:58.082
now's the time.

57:59.458 --> 58:00.291
Right now.

58:05.917 --> 58:08.374
It'll be dark soon. We should head back.

58:09.208 --> 58:10.791
It's cold, what's the plan?

58:14.541 --> 58:15.750
Right...

58:15.791 --> 58:18.625
This next activity is a surprise:

58:18.875 --> 58:22.124
camping as a couple... without gear.

58:23.458 --> 58:25.666
That's not in the brochure...

58:27.291 --> 58:29.000
or in the promo video.

58:30.541 --> 58:31.833
Absolutely not.

58:31.875 --> 58:34.291
I'm not dying here. I'm out.

58:34.333 --> 58:36.333
We can't go, it'll be dark soon.

58:36.374 --> 58:38.082
We can't split up!

58:38.124 --> 58:39.291
I'm not staying.

58:39.333 --> 58:40.374
We're staying!

58:42.041 --> 58:43.166
Jesus...

58:43.208 --> 58:44.458
No need to yell.

58:44.500 --> 58:45.666
Let's wait a bit.

58:47.625 --> 58:48.792
Surprising.

58:54.166 --> 58:55.666
Impressive, Akim.

58:56.500 --> 58:57.833
Haven't camped much.

58:58.833 --> 59:00.500
Your ancestors taught you?

59:01.666 --> 59:03.041
Yeah.

59:03.625 --> 59:05.458
My grandfather was Bedouin.

59:05.833 --> 59:07.750
When we traveled the desert,

59:07.792 --> 59:09.458
I prepared fires while he...

59:09.500 --> 59:11.666
hunted for goats to eat.

59:13.500 --> 59:15.166
What a rich culture.

59:16.708 --> 59:17.833
I'm from Laval.

59:21.333 --> 59:22.833
There's a Laval in your country?

59:24.583 --> 59:26.249
Ah, it's you.

59:28.249 --> 59:28.999
Want some?

59:29.041 --> 59:31.124
I don't smoke on the job.

59:32.166 --> 59:33.957
Feel free to share,

59:33.999 --> 59:35.625
especially with Geneviève and Bernard.

59:35.666 --> 59:37.666
It'll get the stick out their ass.

59:40.792 --> 59:42.458
Where the hell did you study?

59:44.541 --> 59:45.957
Sleeping in the forest?

59:45.999 --> 59:48.291
As soon as we get back, I'm leaving.

59:48.333 --> 59:49.666
Really? Why?

59:50.833 --> 59:52.625
Emotions...

59:53.541 --> 59:54.875
You saw the shrink,

59:55.291 --> 59:56.291
he jumped me.

59:57.208 --> 59:58.750
Looked hardcore.

59:58.792 --> 59:59.875
New method?

01:00:00.166 --> 01:00:01.291
Scandinavian.

01:00:02.124 --> 01:00:04.249
Ah, the Gestalt-Punch.

01:00:04.291 --> 01:00:06.124
It was upsetting.

01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:07.833
That's why we're here?

01:00:07.875 --> 01:00:09.333
Sure, but it was really hard.

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:12.792
Pascale loved it when you opened up.

01:00:13.541 --> 01:00:14.208
You're right.

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:17.833
Maybe I needed Jacques to beat me up.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:18.750
Maybe.

01:00:18.792 --> 01:00:20.541
Can't wait for him to beat me up.

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.208
I could ask him?
No, spontaneity is best.

01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:25.333
You're right, I was surprised.

01:00:26.999 --> 01:00:28.500
You're a good guy, Marc.

01:00:35.833 --> 01:00:37.124
I really like you.

01:00:42.957 --> 01:00:44.124
I needed this.

01:00:45.166 --> 01:00:46.458
<i>What are the police doing?</i>

01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:49.083
<i>Intimidation tactics have succeeded.</i>

01:00:49.124 --> 01:00:51.625
<i>The Commission has been suspended.</i>

01:00:52.833 --> 01:00:54.124
Judge Bourgault,

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:56.249
you're leaving the country.

01:00:56.291 --> 01:00:58.249
Massarelli's tactics worked.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.916
The Commission has not been dissolved:

01:01:00.957 --> 01:01:02.249
it's on standby.

01:01:02.291 --> 01:01:04.083
I did not resign

01:01:04.124 --> 01:01:05.792
because of intimidation.

01:01:06.458 --> 01:01:09.750
I'm leaving due to family matters.

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:11.957
I do not fear Normand Massarelli.

01:01:12.625 --> 01:01:14.625
You're wearing a bulletproof vest!

01:01:20.083 --> 01:01:22.874
In-laws were gonna watch the kids.

01:01:22.916 --> 01:01:25.124
Friends are babysitting.

01:01:26.874 --> 01:01:28.541
Jacob is 10, Gabriel is 16.

01:01:29.333 --> 01:01:30.166
2 beautiful boys.

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:33.124
I miss Florence so much.

01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:36.500
I'm leaking, I could breastfeed you all.

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:39.874
I miss her too.

01:01:40.375 --> 01:01:43.583
My youngest is 22, my oldest 30.

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:46.208
You're silly.

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:48.041
Bat!

01:01:51.832 --> 01:01:52.916
I hate this!

01:01:53.999 --> 01:01:55.625
Shitty therapy.

01:01:55.667 --> 01:01:57.291
We're getting eaten alive.

01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:58.500
That's the therapy?

01:01:58.750 --> 01:02:00.500
Becoming a mosquito buffet?

01:02:00.832 --> 01:02:01.625
Yup!

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:02.667
Therapy...

01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:04.249
Shitty!

01:02:06.166 --> 01:02:07.208
You have kids?

01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:09.874
Do you want any?

01:02:14.041 --> 01:02:15.500
Later...

01:02:17.416 --> 01:02:20.750
Besides work, Alice is doing her Master's.

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:23.458
I'm hardly there for her,

01:02:24.416 --> 01:02:26.625
so for a baby...?

01:02:29.333 --> 01:02:30.958
You being serious?

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:33.625
How romantic.

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.958
You're a romantic?

01:02:37.124 --> 01:02:37.999
Not exactly.

01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:41.083
Every now and then.

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:43.416
Sometimes, things don't come out right.

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:46.333
Me too, I screw up.

01:02:47.791 --> 01:02:49.291
I ruined my wedding proposal.

01:02:49.333 --> 01:02:50.250
No!

01:02:50.291 --> 01:02:51.667
Well...
You did.

01:02:52.291 --> 01:02:53.750
During our anniversary dinner,

01:02:53.791 --> 01:02:55.999
to prove we were good,

01:02:57.625 --> 01:02:59.124
he chucked a ring on the table.

01:03:00.124 --> 01:03:00.832
No way!

01:03:01.458 --> 01:03:02.916
He might as well have said:

01:03:02.958 --> 01:03:04.458
?Yo... Marry me?”.

01:03:05.832 --> 01:03:06.625
Why?

01:03:06.667 --> 01:03:08.458
Context...

01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.708
It's not easy for a man to propose.

01:03:11.749 --> 01:03:12.999
Really?

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.083
It was a sexy throw.

01:03:16.542 --> 01:03:18.166
Here! Let's get married.

01:03:18.208 --> 01:03:19.166
That's not sexy!

01:03:19.208 --> 01:03:20.874
You weren't there.

01:03:22.416 --> 01:03:23.999
I opened up.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:25.874
It was chivalrous...

01:03:29.416 --> 01:03:30.916
It's unforgivable.

01:03:32.333 --> 01:03:33.458
Do you have kids?

01:03:34.749 --> 01:03:37.208
Our son is 32, our daughter 27.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:39.583
They live abroad.

01:03:39.625 --> 01:03:41.208
Which is fucking great!

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:42.458
Come on!

01:03:42.833 --> 01:03:44.916
She's right, they're unbearable.

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:46.500
Who raised them?

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.916
We had a dog though...

01:03:49.999 --> 01:03:50.791
Poumpi.

01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:52.083
He euthanized him.

01:03:52.124 --> 01:03:53.375
You killed him.

01:03:53.416 --> 01:03:55.166
He was 23 and diabetic.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:57.375
Daily shots...

01:03:57.416 --> 01:03:58.375
I loved injecting him.

01:03:58.416 --> 01:03:59.749
It wasn't a life,

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:01.667
his hind legs were paralysed.

01:04:01.916 --> 01:04:03.375
He'd crawl towards me, imploring:

01:04:03.416 --> 01:04:05.458
?Bernard, let me die.

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.749
Leave me my dignity.”

01:04:06.791 --> 01:04:08.291
Then his anal glands would empty.

01:04:10.291 --> 01:04:12.291
Splendid. Got pictures?

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:14.166
Not with us.

01:04:17.458 --> 01:04:18.542
Are you...

01:04:20.707 --> 01:04:21.958
We're done.

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.250
You're kidding!

01:04:23.291 --> 01:04:25.250
That's disgusting! We're right here!

01:04:25.291 --> 01:04:26.333
There's a forest!

01:04:26.375 --> 01:04:28.083
Go do it on a rock!

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:30.542
They're fucking next to us! Gross!

01:04:30.583 --> 01:04:32.542
We didn't do it on purpose.

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:33.874
Not on purpose?

01:04:33.916 --> 01:04:35.707
I wish you had as much testosterone.

01:04:35.749 --> 01:04:38.041
Shut up! You know what?

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.041
Poumpi hated you.

01:04:39.083 --> 01:04:40.083
Liar!

01:04:40.416 --> 01:04:42.749
Why are you still together?

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:44.874
You should split up.

01:04:44.916 --> 01:04:46.125
Honestly...

01:04:46.791 --> 01:04:49.083
finding a new partner is difficult.

01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:51.250
I'm 60.

01:04:52.583 --> 01:04:55.749
Do I want to live alone at 60, 70?

01:04:56.749 --> 01:04:58.291
Are you married?

01:04:58.916 --> 01:05:00.083
Have any kids?

01:05:03.749 --> 01:05:05.250
I have one.

01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:06.625
A girl.

01:05:08.083 --> 01:05:09.417
Such a princess.

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:11.083
Temperamental.

01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:14.083
Spoiled. That's my fault.

01:05:14.791 --> 01:05:16.999
Cute, but... demanding.

01:05:19.375 --> 01:05:21.666
Funny coincidence,

01:05:21.707 --> 01:05:23.458
like Marc's father,

01:05:24.458 --> 01:05:27.583
my wife died when my daughter was 3.

01:05:28.458 --> 01:05:30.666
I raised her by myself.

01:05:32.916 --> 01:05:34.208
It wasn't easy.

01:05:34.749 --> 01:05:38.041
Raising a child alone is challenging.

01:05:39.666 --> 01:05:41.624
But I'm proud,

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.874
I rose to that challenge.

01:05:44.166 --> 01:05:47.375
I'm happy, she's a wonderful person:

01:05:48.916 --> 01:05:49.916
well-balanced,

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:51.874
lovable, intelligent.

01:05:52.666 --> 01:05:55.125
Needs to learn a thing or two.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.041
When she has kids, she'll understand.

01:05:59.166 --> 01:06:01.542
Another thing I'm sure of:

01:06:02.666 --> 01:06:03.624
I love my kid.

01:06:05.041 --> 01:06:06.624
Always have,

01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:08.291
always will.

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:13.833
Wish I'd had a father like you.

01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:15.083
Me too.

01:06:18.833 --> 01:06:19.542
Bat!

01:06:21.749 --> 01:06:22.916
Idiot!

01:06:24.542 --> 01:06:25.666
Not funny!

01:06:25.708 --> 01:06:26.666
Wasn't a bird.

01:06:26.708 --> 01:06:28.250
Take a nap!

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.291
Wake up! Make noise!

01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:52.582
I hear something!

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.500
You must be the therapy group.

01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:06.375
All good. I found them.

01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:08.000
<i>Are you sure it's them?</i>

01:07:08.041 --> 01:07:09.874
No doubt about that!

01:07:13.708 --> 01:07:15.582
What's the problem?

01:07:16.417 --> 01:07:18.582
Marc is such a good guy.

01:07:18.916 --> 01:07:21.208
I'd make him my boyfriend in a second.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:22.375
If I was a woman...

01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:23.708
I'm not or anything...

01:07:23.749 --> 01:07:25.582
Would you like a moment, guys?

01:07:26.916 --> 01:07:28.166
You know what I mean!

01:07:29.083 --> 01:07:30.958
You're a good guy too.

01:07:34.458 --> 01:07:35.833
Trust one another.

01:08:07.749 --> 01:08:09.916
Being with couples

01:08:10.499 --> 01:08:12.833
going through the same thing as us...

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:14.457
It makes me want to...

01:08:21.541 --> 01:08:24.082
I want to share things I've never told
you.

01:08:24.125 --> 01:08:24.957
Really?!
Really.

01:08:34.457 --> 01:08:35.375
I'm sorry.

01:08:35.417 --> 01:08:36.624
You're not here.

01:08:41.791 --> 01:08:43.416
What should I do with that $100?

01:08:46.624 --> 01:08:48.457
Bring me to Massarelli's restaurant?

01:08:59.957 --> 01:09:00.916
What are you doing?

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:04.416
<i>Thought you wanted to talk.</i>

01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:08.000
Let's have a drink, then talk.

01:09:10.457 --> 01:09:11.332
Easy now.

01:09:19.957 --> 01:09:21.207
<i>Goddammit!</i>

01:09:21.957 --> 01:09:24.292
<i>You said we'd talk.</i>

01:09:51.582 --> 01:09:52.916
I lost Martin.

01:09:52.957 --> 01:09:54.416
He got wasted and left.

01:09:55.749 --> 01:09:58.125
He's just napping outside.

01:10:01.416 --> 01:10:02.749
I can't take this anymore.

01:10:03.083 --> 01:10:05.416
I'm losing it, it's too much.

01:10:05.749 --> 01:10:08.041
Sorry to barge in,

01:10:08.083 --> 01:10:10.125
but you get it? You're a shrink!

01:10:10.749 --> 01:10:11.583
I'm upset.

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:13.875
Really upset.

01:10:13.916 --> 01:10:17.458
He was about to confide

01:10:17.499 --> 01:10:19.416
but he started drinking.

01:10:19.458 --> 01:10:21.916
He drank, fell asleep and left.

01:10:21.958 --> 01:10:24.125
Now, he's snoring on a bench.

01:10:24.541 --> 01:10:26.666
It's a lot to handle for him.

01:10:26.708 --> 01:10:28.791
Alcohol is a means of escape.

01:10:30.916 --> 01:10:33.125
I also wish he opened up.

01:10:34.541 --> 01:10:37.041
Sorry to bother you in your room.

01:10:37.083 --> 01:10:38.833
You're not bothering me.

01:10:39.499 --> 01:10:41.208
We've barely spoken

01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:44.875
but I haven't felt
this validated in years.

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:46.833
It's fucked!

01:10:46.875 --> 01:10:49.332
I'm here to save my relationship.

01:10:49.374 --> 01:10:50.833
To save your relationship.

01:10:52.041 --> 01:10:55.000
I shouldn't really say this, but...

01:10:56.916 --> 01:10:58.125
you give me shivers, man.

01:11:00.708 --> 01:11:01.458
I give you shivers.

01:11:04.041 --> 01:11:05.167
I'm flustered.

01:11:07.499 --> 01:11:09.083
A normal reaction.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.291
I also find you very, very beautiful.

01:11:13.332 --> 01:11:14.167
Really?

01:11:14.583 --> 01:11:17.125
This is a therapist-patient relationship.

01:11:17.167 --> 01:11:19.208
I'll have to ask you to leave.

01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:20.332
Fine.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:22.083
Even though I don't want to.

01:11:25.083 --> 01:11:26.916
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:11:26.958 --> 01:11:29.291
<i>There were 3 murders last night.</i>

01:11:29.332 --> 01:11:31.249
<i>Massarelli is cleaning house.</i>

01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:32.458
<i>No worries.</i>

01:11:32.499 --> 01:11:33.791
<i>The judge resigned,</i>

01:11:33.833 --> 01:11:35.499
<i>the Commission was dissolved,</i>

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:37.416
<i>Massarelli knows we got nothing.</i>

01:11:37.916 --> 01:11:41.083
<i>We can only nab him if Germain talks,</i>

01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:45.499
<i>but you're frolicking
in the woods with him!</i>

01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:48.208
<i>You can't be bothered!</i>

01:11:48.249 --> 01:11:49.416
<i>I'm at a loss here!</i>

01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:51.958
A small setback. But things are good.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.249
Germain's about to talk.

01:11:54.624 --> 01:11:56.083
It's under control.

01:11:57.167 --> 01:11:59.916
I stood in for the shrink,
I'm pretty decent.

01:12:00.374 --> 01:12:02.083
Didn't think I had it in me.

01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:04.000
The couples are making progress!

01:12:04.042 --> 01:12:05.458
<i>You stood in for the shrink?!</i>

01:12:05.499 --> 01:12:06.791
Don't worry.

01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:08.416
<i>? Don't worry?”.</i>

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:11.374
We have a big day ahead.

01:12:11.958 --> 01:12:13.708
He's happy. Proud.

01:12:14.042 --> 01:12:15.000
Couples are making progress.

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:16.374
People are getting killed,

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:19.541
but Bernard's gonna
screw his old lady, woohoo!

01:12:19.583 --> 01:12:21.374
I hope he does.

01:12:21.416 --> 01:12:24.207
You beat up our suspect,
insulted patients,

01:12:24.249 --> 01:12:26.125
got us lost in the forest, what next?

01:12:26.167 --> 01:12:27.374
<i>I slept with Jacques.</i>

01:12:27.416 --> 01:12:28.333
<i>What?</i>

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.167
<i>We were talking, you got wasted.</i>

01:12:31.541 --> 01:12:33.291
<i>You left, I panicked</i>

01:12:33.333 --> 01:12:34.333
<i>and went to Jacques.</i>

01:12:34.374 --> 01:12:36.042
He was really nice and...

01:12:36.083 --> 01:12:36.958
You slept with him?

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:37.708
You slept with her?

01:12:37.750 --> 01:12:39.666
We just slept...

01:12:40.583 --> 01:12:41.541
<i>We had sex!</i>

01:12:41.583 --> 01:12:42.374
<i>What?</i>

01:12:42.416 --> 01:12:45.333
<i>I was checking out your
infidelity theory...</i>

01:12:45.374 --> 01:12:46.499
You slept

01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:49.291
with the mafia hitman's girlfriend?

01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:50.125
I'll kill him.

01:12:50.167 --> 01:12:51.791
With the mafia hitman's girlfriend?

01:12:51.833 --> 01:12:52.708
I'll kill him!

01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:53.791
Get over it!

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:57.166
Get over you sleeping with
the mafia hitman's girlfriend?

01:12:57.666 --> 01:12:59.583
Wasn't the best idea.

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:03.207
Not the best idea?!

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:08.333
That's...

01:13:08.875 --> 01:13:11.333
I can't think of any word but? Bad”

01:13:11.374 --> 01:13:13.958
to express how bad the idea was

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.374
to sleep with the bad person.

01:13:16.416 --> 01:13:19.416
Bad timing, bad sexual partner

01:13:19.458 --> 01:13:20.708
to have bad sex with.

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:23.917
Actually, the sex was amazing!
No complaints!

01:13:24.291 --> 01:13:25.750
Oversharing!

01:13:26.249 --> 01:13:27.416
<i>I'll kill him!</i>

01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:29.083
Where is he?

01:13:29.125 --> 01:13:30.917
I'll strangle him with his saggy balls!

01:13:30.958 --> 01:13:33.249
<i>Hey! Say one word</i>

01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:34.458
<i>and we're done!</i>

01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.416
<i>Jacques is a good guy.</i>

01:13:39.333 --> 01:13:41.083
You're a woman,

01:13:41.124 --> 01:13:42.625
you'll understand.

01:13:43.124 --> 01:13:44.583
I've fallen for her.

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:47.917
Haven't felt butterflies in 30 years.

01:13:47.958 --> 01:13:49.791
I probably won't again.

01:13:49.833 --> 01:13:52.249
I think she felt the same.

01:13:52.291 --> 01:13:54.458
We talked all night. Get it?

01:13:54.958 --> 01:13:56.416
Of course, I'm a woman.

01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:57.917
I totally get it.

01:14:00.124 --> 01:14:01.541
Control yourself,

01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:04.458
or you'll be speaking 2 octaves higher.

01:14:04.499 --> 01:14:06.083
Need me to spell it out?

01:14:06.124 --> 01:14:07.750
I'll cut your pee-pee.

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:09.625
I'm sure I love you.

01:14:10.499 --> 01:14:12.583
<i>Babe, I believe you.</i>

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:15.249
Sex is meaningless.

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.750
I felt nothing for that geezer,

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:18.917
he's not a good lay.

01:14:18.958 --> 01:14:20.249
<i>Took him forever.</i>

01:14:21.249 --> 01:14:23.000
<i>It's you I love.</i>

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.082
She's lying.

01:14:24.124 --> 01:14:26.708
We connected, I'm sure.

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:30.082
<i>I'll think about it.</i>

01:14:32.249 --> 01:14:34.458
The good news, they're staying together.

01:14:34.499 --> 01:14:36.416
We can concentrate on our mission.

01:14:37.291 --> 01:14:38.416
The mission!

01:14:47.249 --> 01:14:49.708
This is why we call it bootcamp.

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:51.750
Communication is the key.

01:14:51.791 --> 01:14:53.416
Coordination, endurance...

01:14:53.458 --> 01:14:54.374
I'm doing it.

01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:55.708
Babe, no.
It'll do me good.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:56.958
...blowing off steam.

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.833
You'll be competing together,

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:01.458
even tied to each other.

01:15:08.333 --> 01:15:09.708
Beating me up

01:15:09.750 --> 01:15:11.291
was an unusual method,

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:12.583
but screwing my girlfriend,

01:15:12.625 --> 01:15:14.291
I didn't see that coming.

01:15:14.583 --> 01:15:15.500
Honestly...

01:15:21.541 --> 01:15:22.249
Well done!

01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.416
It was an eye-opener.

01:15:25.458 --> 01:15:27.750
It brought us closer together.

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:29.917
You're an amazing shrink!

01:15:32.249 --> 01:15:33.750
Scandinavian method?

01:15:33.792 --> 01:15:34.917
Thai, actually.

01:15:36.124 --> 01:15:37.750
Don't do it again.

01:15:42.249 --> 01:15:43.625
Give me a second.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.041
Look at him.

01:15:46.082 --> 01:15:48.208
Where's the chapter on sleeping

01:15:48.249 --> 01:15:50.416
with the mafia hitman's girlfriend?

01:15:50.958 --> 01:15:53.124
When you hear this:

01:15:55.291 --> 01:15:56.416
switch partners.

01:15:57.458 --> 01:15:58.416
Switch?

01:15:58.750 --> 01:15:59.875
When there's a switch,

01:15:59.917 --> 01:16:01.541
take the man's position.

01:16:01.583 --> 01:16:02.792
Enough.

01:16:03.249 --> 01:16:04.917
There's no man in our relationship.

01:16:05.416 --> 01:16:06.208
Come on...

01:16:06.249 --> 01:16:08.416
Suzanne has some...

01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:10.750
...traits we associate with men.

01:16:11.792 --> 01:16:14.249
I don't cook and I make twice her salary.

01:16:14.917 --> 01:16:18.124
Am I the man, but only sometimes?

01:16:18.374 --> 01:16:20.124
Carole is 30 years older
than her boyfriend,

01:16:20.166 --> 01:16:21.999
is she the man?

01:16:22.041 --> 01:16:23.833
Bernard is effeminate.

01:16:23.875 --> 01:16:26.291
Akim screams like a girl
when he sees a bug,

01:16:26.875 --> 01:16:29.083
that makes him the woman?

01:16:29.124 --> 01:16:32.333
There's no man in our couple,
is that clear?

01:16:32.374 --> 01:16:33.625
We're both women.

01:16:33.666 --> 01:16:35.041
Two women!

01:16:37.416 --> 01:16:38.166
Very touching.

01:16:40.792 --> 01:16:42.083
Thanks. Duly noted.

01:16:52.083 --> 01:16:52.999
Everyone!

01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:54.999
Time to suffer!

01:16:55.875 --> 01:16:58.416
This training course is challenging.

01:16:59.249 --> 01:17:00.833
It's make or break.

01:17:01.957 --> 01:17:05.041
You're all screw-ups,
so you'll probably break.

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:09.875
Who goes first?

01:17:11.957 --> 01:17:12.583
You do.

01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:14.249
What did you do?

01:17:15.124 --> 01:17:16.666
It's over and done with.

01:17:16.708 --> 01:17:18.875
I can't help picturing it.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:20.416
How long did you kiss?

01:17:21.333 --> 01:17:22.666
Over.

01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:25.041
Over.
Under!

01:17:26.583 --> 01:17:28.208
Raise your stick.
Be more precise.

01:17:28.249 --> 01:17:30.375
?Raise your stick” is pretty precise.

01:17:30.416 --> 01:17:31.249
Forward.

01:17:32.041 --> 01:17:33.583
Now, jump!

01:17:36.333 --> 01:17:37.208
Fuck you.

01:17:37.249 --> 01:17:38.041
Fuck yourself!

01:17:38.083 --> 01:17:39.957
I envy you.

01:17:39.999 --> 01:17:42.833
The passion that makes people suffer...

01:17:43.333 --> 01:17:46.041
You'll never feel that again.

01:17:46.083 --> 01:17:47.375
Your troubles are over.

01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:49.874
Never again will you
feel those butterflies,

01:17:49.916 --> 01:17:53.375
the tiny fuckers who gnaw at your insides.

01:17:55.833 --> 01:17:57.208
Your butterflies are dead,

01:17:58.166 --> 01:18:01.333
pinned to the grey walls of your stomach.

01:18:03.667 --> 01:18:05.124
So lucky!

01:18:05.166 --> 01:18:07.333
It's always crashing into walls with you.

01:18:07.375 --> 01:18:08.291
Really?

01:18:08.333 --> 01:18:09.291
You saying I'm flat?

01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:10.333
What?!

01:18:10.375 --> 01:18:12.124
Walls! I'm flat?

01:18:12.166 --> 01:18:13.291
Are you even listening?

01:18:13.333 --> 01:18:14.458
No!

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:16.375
I had a kid when I was young.

01:18:16.416 --> 01:18:17.708
My wife and I fought too.

01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:18.792
Eventually,

01:18:19.249 --> 01:18:20.541
we stopped fighting.

01:18:20.583 --> 01:18:21.625
What happened?

01:18:22.291 --> 01:18:23.249
She died.

01:18:26.750 --> 01:18:29.958
For a relationship to work,
someone has to die.

01:18:30.458 --> 01:18:31.249
He's crazy.

01:18:31.291 --> 01:18:32.291
Insane.

01:18:34.583 --> 01:18:37.541
Haven't lain together panting in a while?

01:18:37.583 --> 01:18:40.375
Enjoy! Might not happen again.

01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:42.083
Keep it up, Laurel and Hardy!

01:18:45.667 --> 01:18:46.792
Left.

01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:48.792
Towards you.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:51.250
Am I close?

01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:53.250
Pascale, be clear,

01:18:53.625 --> 01:18:55.208
you send mixed messages.

01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:56.541
We don't know what you want.

01:18:56.583 --> 01:18:59.416
Your lover is left
waving his stick around.

01:19:04.458 --> 01:19:06.250
What's going on? Am I close?

01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:07.041
Just relax.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:08.583
What's that tone?

01:19:08.625 --> 01:19:11.541
I'm the shrink,
I use whatever tone I want!

01:19:11.583 --> 01:19:13.916
We're cool, but don't push it,

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:17.208
the Scandinavian method might kill you.

01:19:17.250 --> 01:19:19.416
You're getting on my nerves!

01:19:19.458 --> 01:19:21.416
Completely to the right.

01:19:21.458 --> 01:19:22.375
You're gonna die!

01:19:22.416 --> 01:19:23.916
I'm getting annoyed...

01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:25.375
Forward and down.

01:19:29.832 --> 01:19:30.708
Okay, love,

01:19:30.750 --> 01:19:31.832
go right.

01:19:32.291 --> 01:19:33.416
We can't ignore it.

01:19:33.916 --> 01:19:36.333
Jacques slept with
the mafia hitman's girlfriend.

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:38.625
It happened!

01:19:39.166 --> 01:19:40.083
Jacques slept...

01:19:40.124 --> 01:19:42.458
With the mafia hitman's girlfriend!

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:43.999
Get over it.

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:46.124
Did you see him?

01:19:46.166 --> 01:19:47.750
He almost fought with the mafia hitman.

01:19:47.791 --> 01:19:49.750
At least Pascale doesn't know she slept

01:19:50.458 --> 01:19:53.166
with the head of the organized crime unit.

01:19:55.416 --> 01:19:57.416
The fact that we know who
slept with you-know-who...

01:19:57.916 --> 01:19:58.874
Shut up!

01:19:58.916 --> 01:20:00.416
I have to keep an eye on him.

01:20:00.458 --> 01:20:01.416
Forget your dad!

01:20:01.458 --> 01:20:04.416
He almost fought with the mafia hitman!

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.375
I can't take this anymore!

01:20:08.416 --> 01:20:10.250
Well, neither can I!

01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:12.166
What are you talking about?

01:20:13.667 --> 01:20:16.916
We did it twice yesterday,
things were back to normal.

01:20:16.958 --> 01:20:19.874
Making love doesn't solve the problem.

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:21.083
Sorry I'm so out of it,

01:20:21.124 --> 01:20:23.958
I'm focusing on the mission
my dad's screwing up.

01:20:25.124 --> 01:20:27.667
You're not focusing on the mission or us,

01:20:27.708 --> 01:20:28.874
you're focusing on Jacques.

01:20:28.916 --> 01:20:29.583
Let it go.

01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:32.958
You're 37 and still waiting
for his approval?

01:20:33.791 --> 01:20:36.250
He's 63, he won't change now.

01:20:36.291 --> 01:20:37.583
Let it go!

01:20:37.625 --> 01:20:39.041
That's nonsense!

01:20:39.083 --> 01:20:40.375
Why don't you let go?!

01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:41.916
This is me, letting go.

01:20:43.583 --> 01:20:45.542
That conversation took a bad turn.

01:20:45.583 --> 01:20:46.625
You should've led it elsewhere!

01:20:47.083 --> 01:20:49.250
Don't think about this anymore.

01:20:50.416 --> 01:20:51.874
Out of bounds.

01:20:51.916 --> 01:20:53.375
Good news!

01:20:53.416 --> 01:20:55.208
Uh... Scratch that!

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.291
It's open bar.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:05.416
<i>In 4th place, the ping pong-playing cat...</i>

01:21:05.458 --> 01:21:07.916
<i>If only there were Olympic Games for cats.</i>

01:21:09.416 --> 01:21:12.916
<i>The 3rd-place video instantly went viral:</i>

01:21:13.916 --> 01:21:16.250
<i>couples in therapy, lost in the forest,</i>

01:21:17.416 --> 01:21:19.916
thought they were
getting attacked by a bear.

01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:22.041
<i>They don't just need couples therapy,</i>

01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:23.416
<i>they need to be committed.</i>

01:21:30.666 --> 01:21:32.958
It's not even 9:00!

01:21:46.833 --> 01:21:48.916
The bootcamp was so challenging.

01:21:50.083 --> 01:21:50.999
It was gruelling.

01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:53.583
Pushing her wheelchair will be gruelling.

01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:57.542
Where are you heading?

01:21:57.583 --> 01:21:58.375
What are you doing?

01:22:00.542 --> 01:22:01.666
Hey, everyone!

01:22:01.707 --> 01:22:03.500
Don't tell me to calm down!

01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:05.125
Jacques insulted us!

01:22:05.749 --> 01:22:06.999
This is wonderful.

01:22:07.041 --> 01:22:08.999
We're celebrating our breakup.

01:22:09.041 --> 01:22:10.083
Thanks to Jacques,

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:12.874
we're splitting up
to get our butterflies back.

01:22:12.916 --> 01:22:13.624
Butterflies?

01:22:13.666 --> 01:22:14.749
Amazing therapy!

01:22:14.791 --> 01:22:16.999
You'll dump me because
you think I'll dump you.

01:22:17.041 --> 01:22:19.208
I never will
and you'll dump me for nothing.

01:22:19.250 --> 01:22:20.166
Don't dump me!

01:22:22.583 --> 01:22:24.791
Is it Jacques' wheelchair comment?

01:22:29.583 --> 01:22:30.500
You!

01:22:40.874 --> 01:22:41.542
No way!

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:43.666
What are you doing?

01:22:45.166 --> 01:22:46.125
Stay here.

01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:47.125
You're ridiculous.

01:22:47.166 --> 01:22:48.125
You're not going anywhere.

01:22:48.166 --> 01:22:50.791
I'll hit you, Scandinavian style.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:51.874
Don't do it!

01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:54.083
Hey!

01:22:58.666 --> 01:23:01.041
Stop him, I'll deal with Martin.

01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:03.624
He drove up in his cart...

01:23:03.666 --> 01:23:05.208
Said he killed his wife.

01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:07.375
Sorry!

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:09.833
Pascale needs a private session.

01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:15.291
You're weird.

01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:16.333
He's weird.

01:23:17.500 --> 01:23:19.833
So what if I need a private session?

01:23:20.417 --> 01:23:21.874
Privately.

01:23:23.666 --> 01:23:25.333
You're a professional?

01:23:25.666 --> 01:23:27.874
A private session is a bad idea.

01:23:27.916 --> 01:23:29.749
The mother of bad ideas.

01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:31.708
The supreme bad idea.

01:23:31.749 --> 01:23:33.708
A bad idea within a bad idea.

01:23:33.749 --> 01:23:35.541
The inception of all bad ideas.

01:23:35.582 --> 01:23:37.541
I don't know you well,

01:23:37.582 --> 01:23:39.083
but if you don't shove off,

01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:41.375
I'll show you the inception of a slap.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:42.958
You don't know what inception means.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.916
No, but I know what a slap is.

01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:46.292
Pascale and I...

01:24:10.582 --> 01:24:12.292
Jacques, she's a patient.

01:24:12.333 --> 01:24:14.125
Who needs to talk, so bye!

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:18.125
Where's Pascale?

01:24:18.458 --> 01:24:19.582
She needed some rest.

01:24:19.624 --> 01:24:21.749
You wanna lose your license?

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:25.250
Go in there and there'll be consequences.

01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:26.624
I hope so!

01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:33.541
She left with Jacques.

01:24:34.041 --> 01:24:34.916
That fucker!

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:36.333
It's a private session.

01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:37.208
Christ!

01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:40.708
Happy to see you!

01:24:40.749 --> 01:24:42.375
He left with Pascale.
Who?

01:24:42.417 --> 01:24:44.417
Tattooed Dr. Phil! I'll kill him.

01:24:45.083 --> 01:24:46.833
You want to kill him.
Yes!

01:24:52.916 --> 01:24:53.708
What are you doing?

01:24:53.749 --> 01:24:55.417
Hugging. Men don't touch enough.

01:24:56.916 --> 01:24:57.958
Out of my way!

01:24:58.583 --> 01:24:59.749
That fucker!

01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:02.250
I'll kill the fucker!

01:25:08.417 --> 01:25:10.624
You can't barge in there.

01:25:10.666 --> 01:25:13.083
You can't kill the shrink...

01:25:13.624 --> 01:25:15.083
Mind your business!

01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:16.417
Sure, but I spoke to him.

01:25:17.250 --> 01:25:19.791
He has high blood pressure, had 3 strokes.

01:25:20.250 --> 01:25:22.375
Go back to the bar. Understood?

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:24.749
Yes, sir. Enjoy your stay. Thank you.

01:25:33.708 --> 01:25:34.958
My savior.

01:25:36.292 --> 01:25:37.791
I'm not feeling well.

01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:39.416
Marc was just here.

01:25:39.457 --> 01:25:40.583
Not Marc.

01:25:41.583 --> 01:25:43.208
He hates it when I'm like this.

01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:44.041
Really?

01:25:44.083 --> 01:25:45.916
I have to cool down.

01:25:46.916 --> 01:25:48.208
I can't find my key.

01:25:48.250 --> 01:25:49.708
I'm looking for Pascale.

01:25:49.749 --> 01:25:51.416
Help me. I'm boiling.

01:25:54.624 --> 01:25:55.708
I'm hot too.

01:25:55.749 --> 01:25:57.041
I'm feeling sick.

01:25:57.083 --> 01:25:58.583
You need water.

01:25:59.416 --> 01:26:00.708
I have water in my room.

01:26:00.749 --> 01:26:02.875
I'll deal with the shrink later.

01:26:02.916 --> 01:26:04.250
Thanks.

01:26:06.749 --> 01:26:08.125
I have scotch too.

01:26:28.292 --> 01:26:29.083
Drink this.

01:26:29.125 --> 01:26:29.833
Thanks.

01:26:32.791 --> 01:26:35.250
Didn't think we'd do this again.

01:26:35.292 --> 01:26:37.958
The chemistry is undeniable.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.666
You get me.

01:26:41.708 --> 01:26:43.041
Same here.

01:26:43.083 --> 01:26:44.624
After my wife's passing,

01:26:44.666 --> 01:26:46.416
I didn't think it possible.

01:26:46.458 --> 01:26:49.167
The huge age gap doesn't bother me.

01:26:49.208 --> 01:26:50.458
Me either.

01:26:54.250 --> 01:26:55.749
You're a bad boy?

01:26:55.791 --> 01:26:57.208
A very bad boy.

01:26:58.125 --> 01:26:59.875
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

01:26:59.916 --> 01:27:01.833
You don't want to know.
Nothing scares me.

01:27:06.875 --> 01:27:08.041
Time to head back.

01:27:08.083 --> 01:27:10.416
I'm telling you, I'm rough.

01:27:12.499 --> 01:27:13.583
What's going on?

01:27:14.583 --> 01:27:15.332
Where's Jacques?!

01:27:16.374 --> 01:27:18.958
Why is Alice in Martin's room?

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.750
Alice is with Martin...

01:27:21.541 --> 01:27:23.958
because Jacques is with Pascale.

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:27.332
It's a swap.

01:27:27.916 --> 01:27:30.416
Actually, it's a... transfer.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.583
Jacques might've...

01:27:37.208 --> 01:27:39.041
maybe, vaguely slept with...

01:27:40.541 --> 01:27:43.041
the mafia hitman's girlfriend.

01:27:45.833 --> 01:27:47.666
Yes, the Mafia.

01:27:47.708 --> 01:27:49.541
Sometimes, in our line of work...

01:27:49.583 --> 01:27:51.000
Sex happens.

01:27:51.041 --> 01:27:51.791
What?!

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:54.833
I know, he's 78 years older than her!

01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.208
I'll kill you!

01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.875
I will literally kill you.

01:28:00.708 --> 01:28:01.958
With my own hands.

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.791
I'll take your head and your father's head

01:28:04.833 --> 01:28:06.083
and smash them together.

01:28:09.208 --> 01:28:12.000
Till all that's left is a puddle of blood
and shit.

01:28:13.499 --> 01:28:15.666
That's all you have in your heads:

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:16.750
shit!

01:28:18.833 --> 01:28:20.042
I hear you.

01:28:24.416 --> 01:28:25.291
That's a normal reaction.

01:28:25.332 --> 01:28:26.208
Shut up!

01:28:26.249 --> 01:28:27.541
Wouldn't want to rush things.

01:28:27.583 --> 01:28:30.875
For the remainder of the therapy...

01:28:30.916 --> 01:28:32.750
Finish the week with Martin.

01:28:32.791 --> 01:28:34.708
I was just about to say that!

01:28:34.750 --> 01:28:35.916
We're totally in sync.

01:28:42.458 --> 01:28:43.333
Wait, why...

01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:46.458
Why do you want me to
finish the week with Martin?

01:28:48.333 --> 01:28:49.624
Because...

01:28:49.916 --> 01:28:51.083
Won't you be upset

01:28:51.125 --> 01:28:52.583
that I'm trying to save my relationship,

01:28:52.624 --> 01:28:54.167
that you're helping me save it,

01:28:54.791 --> 01:28:56.208
that I'm sleeping with him?

01:28:56.249 --> 01:28:56.916
Hold on...

01:28:57.624 --> 01:29:00.624
Why do you want to
finish the week with him?

01:29:01.333 --> 01:29:03.000
We're talking about you.

01:29:04.291 --> 01:29:07.249
You're so hot, the bad boy might come out.

01:29:07.291 --> 01:29:08.916
You've been bad?

01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:09.916
Really bad.

01:29:10.458 --> 01:29:11.167
Tell me more.

01:29:11.958 --> 01:29:12.750
Later.

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:18.083
How should I behave? You're in my room.

01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:19.042
I know...

01:29:19.083 --> 01:29:20.291
Think about Pascale.

01:29:20.333 --> 01:29:21.791
I really love Marc.

01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:23.583
And... I'm pregnant.

01:29:24.958 --> 01:29:26.833
That's great news!

01:29:26.875 --> 01:29:28.916
Are you a cock tease?

01:29:30.583 --> 01:29:31.499
That motherfucker!

01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:32.374
Bad idea!

01:29:37.291 --> 01:29:38.249
<i>I'm so sorry!</i>

01:29:38.291 --> 01:29:39.374
I love her.

01:29:39.416 --> 01:29:40.541
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:43.458
It's more complicated than you think.

01:29:43.499 --> 01:29:45.374
For me, it's 100...

01:29:45.416 --> 01:29:46.916
1000 times more complicated.

01:29:46.958 --> 01:29:50.374
It's fucked up that you keep insisting

01:29:50.416 --> 01:29:51.916
I stay with him.

01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:54.083
Why do you insist on staying?

01:29:54.125 --> 01:29:55.125
He scares you?

01:29:55.166 --> 01:29:56.458
I'm not scared, you are!

01:29:56.499 --> 01:29:57.416
I am!

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:58.374
What's the deal?

01:29:58.416 --> 01:29:59.917
You're married? Got kids?

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:02.583
Who cares?

01:30:03.083 --> 01:30:06.083
I care! You'd be in danger if I told you.

01:30:06.125 --> 01:30:07.291
In danger?

01:30:08.125 --> 01:30:09.458
Just tell me.

01:30:09.499 --> 01:30:10.458
If you only knew...

01:30:10.499 --> 01:30:13.249
You tell me your great reason!

01:30:13.291 --> 01:30:15.042
Go ahead, I'm really intrigued.

01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:16.541
Ladies first!

01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:18.249
Age before beauty!

01:30:18.291 --> 01:30:19.791
- You're so immature.
- You're senile!

01:30:19.833 --> 01:30:21.583
- You're really irritating!
- You're fucking annoying!

01:30:21.625 --> 01:30:22.791
- Whatever!
- Fuck this shit!

01:30:22.833 --> 01:30:23.958
- I'm a cop!
- I'm a cop!

01:30:28.791 --> 01:30:30.042
<i>The RCMP?</i>

01:30:30.083 --> 01:30:31.750
The mafia hitman's girlfriend

01:30:31.791 --> 01:30:33.499
works for the RCMP?

01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:35.416
I've been on this case for 2 years.

01:30:35.458 --> 01:30:38.249
Best covert agent. He's under her spell.

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:39.458
He's clueless.

01:30:39.791 --> 01:30:41.583
He's about to crack.

01:30:42.583 --> 01:30:45.249
Ethics and professionalism
mean nothing to you?

01:30:45.291 --> 01:30:46.249
Calm down.

01:30:46.291 --> 01:30:47.249
It's no big deal,

01:30:47.291 --> 01:30:49.708
I've slept with a few witnesses in my day.

01:30:49.750 --> 01:30:50.583
Same.

01:30:52.291 --> 01:30:53.917
Sorry. My bad.

01:30:53.958 --> 01:30:55.208
You've both done this before,

01:30:55.249 --> 01:30:56.791
all good, sorry.

01:30:57.124 --> 01:30:59.750
Fuck the case. Let's start a commune,

01:30:59.791 --> 01:31:01.208
grow our hair out

01:31:01.249 --> 01:31:02.875
and bump uglies to the Grateful Dead.

01:31:02.917 --> 01:31:04.541
Show some respect!

01:31:04.583 --> 01:31:05.875
If we cooperate,

01:31:05.917 --> 01:31:07.458
he'll talk.

01:31:08.082 --> 01:31:10.917
Tomorrow, we're talking about intimacy...

01:31:12.917 --> 01:31:14.042
Enough, you clowns!

01:31:14.082 --> 01:31:15.249
You're risking the lives

01:31:15.291 --> 01:31:18.416
of parents and children
with your shenanigans!

01:31:19.249 --> 01:31:21.042
I'm taking control of the therapy

01:31:21.082 --> 01:31:23.541
and I will not help you!

01:31:23.583 --> 01:31:26.750
You're in no position
to stop me from doing my job.

01:31:27.583 --> 01:31:28.208
Shut up.

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.583
You're not even doing your job.

01:31:30.124 --> 01:31:31.917
He's right, you keep messing things up.

01:31:32.416 --> 01:31:33.875
Martin was about to snitch.

01:31:33.917 --> 01:31:34.875
He was this close

01:31:34.917 --> 01:31:36.208
and eating out of my hand!

01:31:36.249 --> 01:31:38.082
You fucked up his relationship.

01:31:38.416 --> 01:31:39.917
His fake relationship...

01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:43.082
You're so selfish.

01:31:43.958 --> 01:31:45.416
You've always been selfish.

01:31:50.791 --> 01:31:52.917
You want to do this alone? Go ahead.

01:31:53.416 --> 01:31:54.625
See if I care.

01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:58.374
You're not my partner, or my father.

01:31:58.416 --> 01:31:59.625
We're finished.

01:32:23.249 --> 01:32:24.249
Fucking Jacques!

01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:27.041
He takes up all the space.

01:32:27.708 --> 01:32:29.875
We're always cleaning up after him.

01:32:30.458 --> 01:32:31.666
He's never grateful.

01:32:31.708 --> 01:32:33.249
He'd never say, "Good job".

01:32:33.291 --> 01:32:35.374
Is that too much to ask?

01:32:36.999 --> 01:32:40.208
Look, I can't stop talking about him.

01:32:43.041 --> 01:32:44.458
This might be our last case together

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:45.625
and he screwed everything up.

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:46.875
I wish things had gone smoothly,

01:32:47.374 --> 01:32:49.833
that he'd see I can take over.

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:53.333
I'm still talking about him. See that?

01:32:53.374 --> 01:32:55.708
Me-me-me! Exactly like him.

01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:57.249
Do I remind you of him?

01:32:57.291 --> 01:32:58.249
Sometimes.

01:32:58.541 --> 01:33:02.208
It's normal, he's scared of ageing.
I'm only 37.

01:33:02.249 --> 01:33:03.708
Seeing him with Pascale,

01:33:03.750 --> 01:33:05.374
it's clear he's not scared of ageing,

01:33:05.416 --> 01:33:07.083
but of growing old alone.

01:33:09.750 --> 01:33:10.458
So...

01:33:10.875 --> 01:33:12.249
I didn't get that either?

01:33:12.291 --> 01:33:15.625
I'm not there, even with my dad?

01:33:15.666 --> 01:33:18.208
I'm a lousy boyfriend <i>and</i> a shitty son?

01:33:18.583 --> 01:33:20.166
Are you really pregnant?

01:33:20.792 --> 01:33:22.541
Are you happy or disappointed?

01:33:22.583 --> 01:33:23.583
Slightly disappointed.

01:33:23.625 --> 01:33:24.957
Good for me?
Very good.

01:33:24.999 --> 01:33:26.041
You owe me $100?

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:27.041
I'll give you $75.

01:33:27.083 --> 01:33:27.875
More than expected.

01:33:27.917 --> 01:33:28.666
My pleasure.

01:33:28.708 --> 01:33:29.500
Change of tone?

01:33:29.541 --> 01:33:30.166
Yesss!

01:33:31.750 --> 01:33:33.583
What's happening
inside your head is great!

01:33:34.041 --> 01:33:35.666
Just remember to breathe.

01:33:37.249 --> 01:33:38.208
Breathe.

01:33:41.166 --> 01:33:41.875
I'm sorry.

01:33:43.333 --> 01:33:45.999
Thanks for being this way... with me.

01:33:47.708 --> 01:33:49.333
I should treat you so well.

01:33:55.999 --> 01:33:57.792
There's a part of me you don't know.

01:33:57.833 --> 01:33:59.208
That I'm not proud of.

01:33:59.833 --> 01:34:00.999
I'm listening.

01:34:01.916 --> 01:34:03.291
You can trust me.

01:34:03.333 --> 01:34:04.333
You're sweet.

01:34:05.041 --> 01:34:07.583
If what I'm about to say got out,

01:34:09.166 --> 01:34:11.333
it could cost me my life.

01:34:12.541 --> 01:34:14.750
Take this to the grave, okay?

01:34:15.166 --> 01:34:15.999
Of course.

01:34:16.249 --> 01:34:17.583
I can't...

01:34:19.333 --> 01:34:20.833
...bear this alone anymore.

01:34:29.416 --> 01:34:30.458
I like...

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:32.249
cross-dressing.

01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:33.416
What?

01:34:34.083 --> 01:34:36.750
I enjoy wearing women's clothing.

01:34:37.416 --> 01:34:39.208
I'm not gay or anything,

01:34:39.249 --> 01:34:40.249
I like women.

01:34:40.291 --> 01:34:41.583
You know I love women.

01:34:41.625 --> 01:34:43.416
Inside, I'm a man, but...

01:34:44.792 --> 01:34:46.166
I enjoy wearing women's clothing.

01:34:48.166 --> 01:34:49.750
That's your big secret?

01:34:52.500 --> 01:34:54.291
Expecting something else?

01:34:54.333 --> 01:34:55.625
I dunno...

01:34:57.333 --> 01:34:58.291
I'm shocked.

01:35:01.458 --> 01:35:02.625
Feels good?

01:35:02.667 --> 01:35:03.874
Real good.

01:35:03.916 --> 01:35:05.458
<i>Thanks for listening.</i>

01:35:10.458 --> 01:35:12.792
Côté. He's the one who came to us.

01:35:13.124 --> 01:35:14.291
Let go.

01:35:19.291 --> 01:35:20.291
I've got something for you.

01:35:21.124 --> 01:35:22.792
Martin Germain and Jacques Laroche.

01:35:24.291 --> 01:35:25.750
A crazy cop.

01:35:43.958 --> 01:35:44.667
I'll handle it.

01:36:05.083 --> 01:36:05.832
Rhythm.

01:36:06.416 --> 01:36:08.832
Essential to dancers. Couples too.

01:36:10.124 --> 01:36:11.667
The dance you'll perform now

01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:14.250
will reveal the state
of your relationship.

01:36:14.750 --> 01:36:16.791
Harmonious movements,

01:36:16.832 --> 01:36:18.208
understanding each other,

01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.458
anticipating.

01:36:20.083 --> 01:36:22.083
No one can give up.

01:36:23.583 --> 01:36:25.333
Love each other, dammit!

01:36:25.958 --> 01:36:26.958
Music!

01:36:51.416 --> 01:36:52.208
Forget the waltz.

01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:53.874
Since we got here, Élissa and I

01:36:53.916 --> 01:36:56.041
realized life is short.

01:36:56.083 --> 01:36:58.416
Even with a kid, we can still have fun.

01:36:58.458 --> 01:37:00.749
Because we love each other.

01:38:23.083 --> 01:38:23.916
Sorry.

01:38:24.208 --> 01:38:25.041
So sorry!

01:39:03.583 --> 01:39:06.333
My love, thanks for accepting me as I am.

01:39:10.333 --> 01:39:11.666
I haven't told you everything.

01:39:12.666 --> 01:39:15.333
I have another secret. Here goes:

01:39:15.916 --> 01:39:16.999
I'm a criminal.

01:39:17.041 --> 01:39:18.458
I've tortured men,

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:19.333
even killed some.

01:39:19.375 --> 01:39:20.999
I want to turn my life around.

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:27.041
I can't keep lying to you.
I want to change.

01:39:27.083 --> 01:39:27.916
Hurry!

01:39:30.083 --> 01:39:31.250
I hope one day,

01:39:32.250 --> 01:39:33.083
you'll forgive me.

01:39:46.458 --> 01:39:47.624
Where's Martin Germain?

01:40:19.458 --> 01:40:20.458
The cha-cha?

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:23.500
In a skirt?

01:40:23.791 --> 01:40:25.582
You've really gone soft.

01:40:26.582 --> 01:40:28.083
Nobody move!

01:40:28.874 --> 01:40:30.250
Why are you here?

01:40:30.292 --> 01:40:32.749
You should've killed me. You're screwed!

01:40:33.041 --> 01:40:34.749
Your friends, the tattooed geezer,

01:40:34.791 --> 01:40:36.708
the smartass and his girl, they're cops.

01:40:36.749 --> 01:40:38.417
They wanted you to snitch.

01:40:40.624 --> 01:40:41.624
Is that true?

01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:44.749
Motherfuckers.

01:40:45.250 --> 01:40:46.375
Traitors!

01:40:46.417 --> 01:40:48.833
I can't leave any witnesses.

01:40:49.916 --> 01:40:51.417
No choice, I'm sorry.

01:40:52.250 --> 01:40:53.041
I didn't talk!

01:40:53.083 --> 01:40:54.916
They have nothing.

01:40:54.958 --> 01:40:55.874
Really?

01:40:55.916 --> 01:40:57.916
You drank tea and talked retirement plans?

01:41:08.083 --> 01:41:09.250
I'll kill you all!

01:42:06.250 --> 01:42:07.000
That way!

01:42:12.417 --> 01:42:13.041
Come on!

01:42:24.624 --> 01:42:26.375
Take the bus, leave with him!

01:42:26.416 --> 01:42:27.416
Call backup!

01:42:37.375 --> 01:42:38.749
You're a cop too?

01:42:39.583 --> 01:42:40.457
Jesus Christ!

01:42:41.125 --> 01:42:42.583
I'm sorry.
All good.

01:42:56.250 --> 01:42:57.083
Ow!

01:42:59.250 --> 01:43:00.583
Marc, go around.

01:43:02.916 --> 01:43:05.041
You're a better cop than a shrink.

01:43:05.083 --> 01:43:06.416
I'm a great psychologist.

01:43:11.374 --> 01:43:13.208
It was fun while it lasted.

01:43:14.416 --> 01:43:16.875
You made me a better man.

01:43:17.708 --> 01:43:18.875
Could I still borrow

01:43:18.916 --> 01:43:20.374
your little black skirt.

01:43:21.708 --> 01:43:22.499
Don't move!

01:43:22.541 --> 01:43:23.541
Côté, calm down!

01:43:27.208 --> 01:43:29.167
Now you die, RuPaul.

01:43:29.208 --> 01:43:31.167
You had an unhappy childhood...

01:43:31.208 --> 01:43:33.083
I had a great childhood!

01:43:36.041 --> 01:43:36.875
Calm down, Côté.

01:43:42.875 --> 01:43:43.875
You need help.

01:43:47.208 --> 01:43:49.041
You had a difficult childhood.

01:43:50.583 --> 01:43:52.374
Stop talking about my childhood!

01:43:57.875 --> 01:43:59.416
We missed you, buddy.

01:44:05.541 --> 01:44:06.208
Good thinking.

01:44:26.833 --> 01:44:27.624
Case closed.

01:44:33.499 --> 01:44:34.541
Mister Laroche.

01:44:35.958 --> 01:44:37.541
My childhood hero!

01:44:38.250 --> 01:44:39.458
Congratulations.
Thanks.

01:44:39.958 --> 01:44:40.666
Ciao, guys.

01:44:41.083 --> 01:44:42.458
Lucky you were here.

01:44:43.541 --> 01:44:44.374
It's just experience.

01:44:44.416 --> 01:44:46.332
Amazing seeing you in action.

01:44:46.374 --> 01:44:48.250
It was pure instinct.

01:44:49.541 --> 01:44:50.583
I have to tell you something.

01:44:52.416 --> 01:44:54.374
I don't want any misunderstandings.

01:44:57.416 --> 01:44:58.416
Me neither.

01:44:59.042 --> 01:45:00.042
I mean...

01:45:00.083 --> 01:45:02.042
whatever happens with you and Pascale...

01:45:03.167 --> 01:45:04.125
you should know...

01:45:05.708 --> 01:45:07.208
you're my dad and...

01:45:10.332 --> 01:45:11.499
you can count on me.

01:45:11.541 --> 01:45:12.875
You won't be alone.

01:45:14.374 --> 01:45:15.708
I'll take care of you.

01:45:16.208 --> 01:45:17.125
Some day.

01:45:17.958 --> 01:45:20.791
I'll feed you if it comes to that.
And wash you.

01:45:22.374 --> 01:45:23.666
I'll rinse you too.

01:45:24.666 --> 01:45:25.374
I'll...

01:45:25.791 --> 01:45:28.249
groom you, trim your hair,

01:45:28.291 --> 01:45:30.167
I'll even change your diaper!

01:45:31.208 --> 01:45:35.291
Not now, unless you have
something to tell me.

01:45:35.333 --> 01:45:37.499
I'll change it with my own hands.

01:45:38.291 --> 01:45:39.125
Don't worry.

01:45:42.708 --> 01:45:44.958
I love you, son. I'm proud of you.

01:45:52.708 --> 01:45:54.333
Any comments, Judge?

01:45:55.333 --> 01:45:57.916
It's a complete coincidence
that we've returned

01:45:57.958 --> 01:45:59.791
after Massarelli's arrest.

01:46:02.791 --> 01:46:04.458
It's true I'm reassured

01:46:05.167 --> 01:46:08.374
that he'll spend
the next 40 years behind bars.

01:46:10.374 --> 01:46:11.374
But what really matters

01:46:11.875 --> 01:46:14.541
is that, thanks to the police's efforts,

01:46:14.875 --> 01:46:16.374
justice has been served.

01:46:23.541 --> 01:46:24.750
Are we there?

01:46:24.791 --> 01:46:26.083
Almost.

01:46:28.416 --> 01:46:29.958
Take it off.

01:46:31.583 --> 01:46:33.042
Happy retirement!

01:46:38.583 --> 01:46:39.917
Good luck.
Thanks.

01:46:39.958 --> 01:46:42.166
Happy retirement. Well deserved.
Thanks.

01:46:42.207 --> 01:46:43.541
Congrats.
Minister!

01:46:44.125 --> 01:46:45.249
Still in office?

01:46:45.291 --> 01:46:47.625
I've been made Minister of Culture.
Nice promotion!

01:46:49.083 --> 01:46:49.958
Congrats, Dad.

01:46:50.583 --> 01:46:52.249
I won't say? It's about time.”

01:46:53.958 --> 01:46:55.083
Congratulations,

01:46:55.125 --> 01:46:56.499
I'm so happy for you.

01:46:56.541 --> 01:46:59.042
She sure is happy, she got my job.

01:46:59.083 --> 01:47:00.207
Well, well!

01:47:00.249 --> 01:47:02.042
Have an amazing retirement!

01:47:04.125 --> 01:47:05.416
My ex-daughter-in-law.

01:47:06.666 --> 01:47:07.666
Tell me,

01:47:08.207 --> 01:47:09.291
how do you do it?

01:47:09.333 --> 01:47:11.000
What do you see in him?

01:47:11.042 --> 01:47:11.875
So...

01:47:11.917 --> 01:47:14.083
how's the world's worst fake therapist?

01:47:15.249 --> 01:47:17.042
What are you all doing here?

01:47:17.083 --> 01:47:18.333
We were in the neighbourhood

01:47:18.374 --> 01:47:20.333
and felt like getting insulted.

01:47:20.374 --> 01:47:22.541
Marc insisted!

01:47:23.333 --> 01:47:24.708
This is your son?

01:47:31.708 --> 01:47:33.042
This is Florence.

01:47:33.374 --> 01:47:34.416
She's gorgeous.

01:47:34.458 --> 01:47:35.541
Congratulations.

01:47:36.374 --> 01:47:37.708
You!

01:47:39.374 --> 01:47:40.374
Congratulations!

01:47:40.416 --> 01:47:42.416
Thank you. Careful with your back!

01:47:45.708 --> 01:47:46.541
So you...

01:47:47.583 --> 01:47:49.083
We swapped.

01:47:49.374 --> 01:47:50.833
He kisses like a god.

01:47:50.875 --> 01:47:52.541
Carole does everything.

01:47:54.541 --> 01:47:56.166
Congratulations!

01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:57.458
To Jacques!

01:48:01.625 --> 01:48:03.166
Any news from Martin?

01:48:03.208 --> 01:48:06.042
He's cooperating, he'll get 15 years,

01:48:06.082 --> 01:48:07.666
parole after 10.

01:48:08.583 --> 01:48:09.875
Must be strange for you.

01:48:11.416 --> 01:48:12.541
All part of the job.

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.208
I'm sorry.

01:48:17.583 --> 01:48:19.416
I need time for myself.

01:48:21.166 --> 01:48:22.042
I understand.

01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:27.166
Are we together?

01:48:27.208 --> 01:48:28.082
We're not.

01:48:30.249 --> 01:48:33.500
We're not in an open relationship either.
What?!

01:48:33.541 --> 01:48:35.541
Open, like we can see other people.

01:48:36.042 --> 01:48:37.708
So we're faithful.

01:48:38.708 --> 01:48:40.208
But not together.

01:48:42.875 --> 01:48:46.041
At parties, I might kiss a girlfriend.

01:48:47.541 --> 01:48:50.041
So can I kiss one of your girlfriends?

01:48:50.082 --> 01:48:50.833
Well no.

01:48:50.875 --> 01:48:53.833
Our relationship is open, just for you?

01:48:53.875 --> 01:48:54.666
Exactly.

01:48:54.708 --> 01:48:56.208
Am I getting screwed here?

01:48:58.750 --> 01:48:59.541
Only by me.

01:49:01.041 --> 01:49:03.666
I'm happy he met someone.

01:49:03.708 --> 01:49:05.500
More than he bargained for.

01:49:05.541 --> 01:49:06.208
Much more.

01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:09.750
Makes you think about love.

01:49:12.082 --> 01:49:13.666
Why's that, Kev?

01:49:15.500 --> 01:49:16.625
Well, I dunno, uh...

01:49:17.583 --> 01:49:18.208
Well...

01:49:19.082 --> 01:49:20.541
that perfect someone,

01:49:20.583 --> 01:49:22.958
who'll satisfy your every need,

01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:25.416
who'll fill the void inside you,

01:49:25.458 --> 01:49:26.875
doesn't exist.

01:49:26.917 --> 01:49:29.666
Sometimes we have to accept

01:49:29.708 --> 01:49:32.666
that love is a big let-down.

01:49:34.291 --> 01:49:38.208
If you can't accept that
it can be totally shitty,

01:49:38.249 --> 01:49:39.875
you don't really know what love is.

01:49:39.917 --> 01:49:40.999
Just look at you two.

01:49:42.041 --> 01:49:45.166
You felt that Marc was there,
but not there.

01:49:45.208 --> 01:49:46.541
You wanted him to be completely there.

01:49:47.333 --> 01:49:49.333
Marc, you thought you were there,

01:49:49.374 --> 01:49:50.625
but you weren't really and...

01:49:51.124 --> 01:49:52.750
now, you're still not completely there,

01:49:52.792 --> 01:49:54.500
but you are a bit more.

01:49:55.333 --> 01:49:56.792
That's it, really.

01:49:57.625 --> 01:49:58.708
And that's love.

01:49:58.750 --> 01:49:59.833
Precisely.

01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:01.792
Thank you, Kev.

01:50:02.291 --> 01:50:03.083
For what?

01:50:18.875 --> 01:50:20.083
This is boring.

01:50:20.124 --> 01:50:20.957
You bet.

01:55:30.749 --> 01:55:32.083
Tell me something.

01:55:32.666 --> 01:55:33.542
What?

01:55:33.916 --> 01:55:34.916
Apache Poitras.

01:55:35.874 --> 01:55:36.999
When you arrested him,

01:55:37.375 --> 01:55:39.666
was it when Fripon shot you?

01:55:39.708 --> 01:55:41.874
No, 2 different cases.

01:55:45.833 --> 01:55:46.666
Tell me about it.

01:55:47.291 --> 01:55:48.542
No big thing.

01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:50.916
Fripon was the nephew
of the Hells' leader.

01:55:52.125 --> 01:55:53.666
I became his best friend.

01:55:53.708 --> 01:55:56.250
He had no clue I was a cop.

01:55:57.125 --> 01:55:59.208
I screwed up and slept with his sister.

01:55:59.250 --> 01:56:02.624
You slept with the sister of the nephew
of the Hells' leader.

01:56:02.874 --> 01:56:03.542
Many times.

01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:06.542
Fripon freaked out.

01:56:07.333 --> 01:56:08.833
I've told you this story.

01:56:08.874 --> 01:56:10.125
I like hearing it.

01:56:10.166 --> 01:56:13.458
He took me out for Chinese food.

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:15.624
I had the place bugged cause I had slept

01:56:15.666 --> 01:56:18.000
with the goddaughter
of the building's owner.

01:56:18.041 --> 01:56:20.958
You slept with the goddaughter
of the building's owner?

01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:21.916
Many times.

01:56:21.958 --> 01:56:23.791
You slept with the goddaughter

01:56:23.833 --> 01:56:26.000
of the Chinese restaurant's
building's owner?
