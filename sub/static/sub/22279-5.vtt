00:06.767 --> 00:09.067
NARRATOR: On this episode of
Life Below Zero...

00:09.100 --> 00:12.833
The race to prepare
for the freeze has
Alaskans on edge.

00:12.867 --> 00:14.267
Ahhh!

00:14.300 --> 00:16.133
NARRATOR: Chip struggles
to keep his head above water.

00:16.167 --> 00:17.833
AGNES: The wind
has caught the boat.

00:17.867 --> 00:20.867
NARRATOR: Andy makes
a potentially
bone-crushing mistake.

00:20.900 --> 00:22.867
KATE: Ahhh! I gotta move!

00:22.900 --> 00:25.867
NARRATOR: Glenn searches
the Brooks Range
for new hunting grounds.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.700
GLENN: I like to live
as much as possible
on wild food.

00:28.733 --> 00:32.933
NARRATOR: And Sue calls
a World War II vehicle
into active duty.

00:32.967 --> 00:35.500
SUE: It's smoking
like a son of a bitch.

00:52.800 --> 00:57.033
SUE: I've owned
Kavik River Camp now
for a little over a year.

00:57.067 --> 00:59.867
Last year,
one of the things I did,
my food trailer,

00:59.900 --> 01:02.933
my dry food storage
used to be out here
on the path.

01:02.967 --> 01:06.700
I thought I would
move my food trailer
all the way back there

01:06.733 --> 01:09.067
to keep it away from clients.

01:10.900 --> 01:12.933
Error in judgement on my part.

01:12.967 --> 01:15.233
I don't like having to go

01:15.267 --> 01:17.800
almost a mile
to get the dry storage

01:17.833 --> 01:20.067
because the predators
can hide behind anything,

01:20.067 --> 01:21.367
and that's what they did
this spring.

01:21.400 --> 01:24.600
They just hid
and tried to ransack me
as I went through,

01:24.633 --> 01:27.167
and that's way beyond
my comfort zone.

01:27.200 --> 01:29.433
You know, I always say,
"Don't be a pork chop,"

01:29.467 --> 01:31.233
but I made myself
right into one.

01:34.567 --> 01:38.233
NARRATOR: In order to protect
her food storage on camp,

01:38.267 --> 01:43.067
Sue will enlist
a piece of machinery
from the Second World War,

01:43.100 --> 01:45.133
the Nodwell.

01:45.167 --> 01:46.933
SUE: This thing
is pretty freaking cool.

01:46.967 --> 01:49.567
It has tank controls.

01:49.600 --> 01:53.167
Tank tyres,
that's what it used to be,
now it's a vehicle.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.433
Seventy-three years old
but it still runs.

01:55.467 --> 02:00.800
You know, it may have
10 to 12 flat tyres out of 12,
but it still rolls.

02:00.833 --> 02:04.767
The biggest issue,
getting it from where it is

02:04.800 --> 02:06.700
to where I want it to live.

02:07.833 --> 02:09.267
Do we need to do
some groundwork first?

02:09.300 --> 02:11.067
Or am I just gonna
tear it up bringing it over?

02:11.067 --> 02:14.933
Nah, just park it
and I'll guide you
when you're coming through.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.067
RICK: If you come out
to the bushes over here...
SUE: Uh-huh.

02:17.067 --> 02:18.567
And I'll get the water line
out of the way,

02:18.600 --> 02:20.233
because we got a water line
in the bushes.

02:20.267 --> 02:21.833
Yeah, yeah,
that was the other concern.

02:21.867 --> 02:24.100
I'm done with tearing up
water lines.

02:24.133 --> 02:27.133
And then I'll stand
and I'll guide you right up
into this spot here,

02:27.167 --> 02:30.400
make sure you pull straight in
and we'll get the trailer
as level as possible.

02:30.433 --> 02:31.667
It's never gonna be level.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.067
I wanna go inside.
Things are gonna fall over.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.267
There's no way to help it.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.967
Who cares if paper towels
hit the floor?

02:42.067 --> 02:43.633
I do care
if something glass does.

02:46.233 --> 02:48.433
Just open it up and

02:49.133 --> 02:51.767
(SIGHS) see... Yeah.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.700
This is not gonna cut it.

02:54.733 --> 02:56.500
Let's get you down...

02:57.833 --> 02:59.533
In there.

02:59.567 --> 03:02.067
Anything that may
cause a problem...

03:02.067 --> 03:04.900
Those will jiggle.
They won't be bad.

03:04.933 --> 03:08.267
There is always potential
for things to break
and get damaged.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.600
Things will bounce off.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.067
I'll have a lot of cleaning
to do once I move it,

03:12.100 --> 03:14.333
but it all looks
basically good on this end.

03:14.367 --> 03:16.667
It's time to just
shut the door,

03:16.700 --> 03:18.567
lift the stairs,
lock 'em down.

03:21.067 --> 03:22.467
(EXHALES) All right.

03:27.067 --> 03:30.700
I'm gonna kick the tyres,
light the fires,
and get that thing rolling.

03:30.733 --> 03:34.667
See if that 73-year-old
piece of equipment
can make it work.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.533
GLENN: That's what I'm about.
Connection.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.533
Connection to reality,
to nature.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.067
It's a beautiful thing.

04:00.233 --> 04:02.433
(LEAVES RUSTLING)

04:02.467 --> 04:04.133
I'm used to going
without things out here.

04:04.167 --> 04:05.667
I don't use sugar.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.100
I don't like to eat a lot
of store-bought food.

04:08.133 --> 04:10.533
I like to live off the land
as much as I can.

04:12.967 --> 04:14.567
NARRATOR:
With limited resources,

04:14.600 --> 04:17.333
Glenn Villeneuve,
must trek over rugged,
thawing terrain

04:17.367 --> 04:19.800
to secure
a spring food supply.

04:22.100 --> 04:25.500
GLENN: This time of year
the ducks are coming in.
I'm gonna go look for some.

04:25.533 --> 04:27.367
If I can find open water
with no ice on it,

04:27.400 --> 04:29.067
I'm gonna have
more opportunities.

04:29.067 --> 04:31.400
So that's what
I'm looking for today.

04:36.367 --> 04:38.467
It can be a lot harder
travelling around in summer

04:38.500 --> 04:40.300
in a lot of areas here
than it is in the winter.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.133
In the wintertime,
I got trails that are smooth,

04:45.167 --> 04:47.067
hard-packed,
and easy travelling.

04:49.733 --> 04:52.733
In the summertime,
I have to detour around
bodies of water.

04:52.767 --> 04:55.267
I have to walk through bogs.
I get all wet.

04:57.900 --> 05:00.367
There's brush
I have to fight through.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.767
Getting around can be
a lot harder

05:01.800 --> 05:04.133
depending on the country
you're travelling through.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.267
This is a spot
where I'd like to go
look for some ducks.

05:13.333 --> 05:16.067
In recent decades,
the water has fallen.

05:16.067 --> 05:20.667
So it's all melted off
because it's just a shallow
pond now, really.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.400
And the ducks around
at this time of year,

05:22.433 --> 05:24.233
they're looking
for open water.

05:24.267 --> 05:26.067
Here is some right here.

05:28.567 --> 05:30.533
One of the big things
about ducks, too, is that

05:30.567 --> 05:33.700
I have to be able to get them
after I shoot them.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.633
Most of the time
when I shoot ducks,
they're in the water

05:37.667 --> 05:39.500
or they're just taking off
from the water.

05:39.533 --> 05:41.067
And I need to take
into consideration

05:41.100 --> 05:44.167
if they're in a place
where I can get to them.

05:45.467 --> 05:46.667
Okay.

05:46.700 --> 05:49.233
I see some ducks
way down on the other end,

05:49.267 --> 05:51.067
so I'm thinking about
walking around

05:51.100 --> 05:53.667
and seeing how close I can see
another duck there.

05:56.633 --> 06:00.067
Okay, I see two other
ducks here that look like
good eating ducks.

06:10.533 --> 06:11.700
(GUN FIRING)

06:11.733 --> 06:12.767
(GUN COCKING)

06:12.800 --> 06:14.267
(GUN FIRING)

06:15.133 --> 06:16.833
I missed them. They got away.

06:16.867 --> 06:18.500
(DUCKS QUACKING)

06:19.967 --> 06:23.067
ANDY: There's no rest
for the wicked
this time of the year.

06:24.867 --> 06:28.133
You gotta get moving
'cause the summers are short.

06:28.167 --> 06:29.433
It just takes time.

06:29.467 --> 06:31.467
It takes planning.
It takes vision.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.100
(DOGS HOWLING)

06:39.633 --> 06:43.067
Kate and I
are getting ready to go
up river about 30 miles.

06:43.067 --> 06:45.333
We're working on a project
to build

06:45.367 --> 06:47.667
what's called a masonry heater
at our house.

06:47.700 --> 06:50.133
It's a really efficient way
to heat your home.

06:50.167 --> 06:54.500
Basically it's a fireplace
that circulates up and down
and up and down,

06:54.533 --> 06:56.933
and then it goes out
so all of the heat
from the fire

06:56.967 --> 06:58.600
goes directly into the rock.

07:01.300 --> 07:05.067
I don't really like the look
of round cobble rock for this.

07:05.067 --> 07:07.600
So we're going
for the castle look.

07:07.633 --> 07:09.067
In the boat.

07:09.100 --> 07:12.700
And I need about
12,000 pounds of rock
to get ready for this project.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.433
There's a ton of rock
all around here,

07:16.467 --> 07:18.433
but it's all crumbly,
shale type rock,

07:18.467 --> 07:22.733
and you can't build
this type of masonry heater
out of that type of rock.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.100
All right.

07:24.133 --> 07:26.333
You guys ready to go
for a boat ride? Oh, boy!

07:26.367 --> 07:30.533
This will be a good chance
for Kate and I to go camp out
together in the summertime.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.833
We're also gonna bring
Iceberg and Bergis with us

07:32.867 --> 07:35.800
to have some companionship
and some bear alert.

07:37.900 --> 07:41.533
NARRATOR: With spring bears
awake and highly aggressive,

07:41.567 --> 07:45.167
Andy and Kate will need
the extra layer of protection.

07:47.133 --> 07:50.733
It's probably gonna cost me
100 bucks in gas
to go up and back.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.067
I'm gonna take
my army boat with me

07:55.100 --> 07:56.767
so I can haul more rock
at a time.

07:56.800 --> 07:59.767
I like being as efficient
as I can be.

08:03.067 --> 08:04.467
I wanna make
this trip worthwhile.

08:04.500 --> 08:07.567
You know, the more rock
that I can haul down
in one load,

08:07.600 --> 08:11.067
the more efficient this whole
process begins to be.

08:16.267 --> 08:17.667
So what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna make

08:17.700 --> 08:21.067
a whole bunch of these
big piles of rocks,

08:21.067 --> 08:22.467
and then I'll just drive
the boat up

08:22.500 --> 08:25.300
and throw these
into the super sack bags.

08:27.600 --> 08:28.633
(GRUNTS)

08:31.900 --> 08:33.267
(GROWLS)

08:38.133 --> 08:40.300
That's a good stash
right there.

08:41.667 --> 08:43.700
Whoo!

08:43.733 --> 08:45.833
I've got quite a few piles
of rocks going now.

08:45.867 --> 08:48.467
It looks like about, maybe,
10 or 12 piles.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.367
So, a pretty good hit
for this evening.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.433
I'll go back
and see if Kate's got
some dinner going

08:55.467 --> 08:57.933
and put a cold jug of beer
in that nice, icy stream

08:57.967 --> 08:59.567
and chill out
for a little bit.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.067
CHIP: A lot of people
don't get the idea
of being out here.

09:09.067 --> 09:11.833
We get to shape ourselves here
and we get to flow
with nature.

09:11.867 --> 09:14.400
I don't have to have
a cool car parked
in my driveway.

09:14.433 --> 09:16.633
I don't have to wear
the latest in fashions
and stuff.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.267
I have to wear something
that's warm and practical.

09:19.300 --> 09:21.800
Something I can wash
the blood off of.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.200
CHIP: First let's just
drag this over there,

09:28.233 --> 09:29.633
then you guys
can take your things off

09:29.667 --> 09:31.400
so that they're at hand
to put them back on
if you need them.

09:31.433 --> 09:33.233
AGNES: Ready, girls?
Let's go fishing?

09:33.267 --> 09:34.433
CHIP: Yep, grab a corner,
would you?

09:34.467 --> 09:36.267
Or don't grab a corner,
whatever works.

09:36.300 --> 09:40.567
AGNES: Just make sure we got
the floater and the rope.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.633
NARRATOR: Chip
and Agnes Hailstone
are 85 miles away from home

09:43.667 --> 09:46.867
on their seasonal fishing trip
along the Kiwalik River.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.133
They're teaching
their youngest daughters
fishing skills

09:49.167 --> 09:51.767
to help survive
the coming freeze.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.500
CHIP: The plan for today
is to set a net for salmon.

09:54.533 --> 09:57.733
We got chum salmon,
king salmon, pink salmon
and silver salmon.

09:57.767 --> 10:00.433
And what we'd really
like to catch here
are some silver salmon

10:00.467 --> 10:03.067
because we don't catch
lots of silver salmon
on the Kobuk River.

10:04.200 --> 10:06.567
So our plan is to basically
make the most of

10:06.600 --> 10:08.633
what the Kiwalik River
here has to offer.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.667
AGNES: Here's our sinker.

10:10.700 --> 10:15.267
We still have to put it
together, but this will do.

10:16.933 --> 10:18.267
CHIP: So you got
your weight set.

10:18.300 --> 10:20.033
Knock it off, you two,
don't start fighting now.

10:20.067 --> 10:21.567
Watch what your mom is doing.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.533
So now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna tie the floater on

10:24.567 --> 10:26.800
to this point, right here
where the float starts,

10:26.833 --> 10:30.967
and it's gonna mark the end of
our... That buoy there is
gonna mark the end of our net,

10:31.000 --> 10:32.367
so we'll know where
the end of our net is.

10:32.400 --> 10:35.800
So I'm gonna use the boat,
and I'm gonna pull this out.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.700
No, I'll do it myself.

10:38.733 --> 10:41.600
Me and your mom have
been fishing here before
you were born.

10:41.633 --> 10:43.700
-Careful there.
-CAROL: I've got it good.

10:43.733 --> 10:47.700
In the early '90s, when we
started fishing here we used
to put our nets out there

10:47.733 --> 10:51.233
on the upper channel,
and we would just get
socked with fish.

10:51.267 --> 10:54.300
This net was made
by your mom to fit this.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.433
She had a good measurement
of how deep it was.

10:56.467 --> 11:00.167
You know, at high tide
and low tide it's usually
about two feet difference.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.567
I made a net that was
specifically for this river.

11:03.600 --> 11:05.500
This is a shallow,
fast moving river,

11:05.533 --> 11:09.700
so I have this one cut
specifically shorter
for this river.

11:10.933 --> 11:12.667
CHIP: This net is way
older than you kids.

11:12.700 --> 11:14.333
(AGNES SPEAKING)

11:20.800 --> 11:22.233
Okay.

11:23.133 --> 11:24.667
You need help putting it in?

11:24.700 --> 11:25.800
CHIP: No, I'm fine.

11:31.833 --> 11:33.733
AGNES: Wait!

11:33.767 --> 11:35.500
CHIP: Okay, here we go.

11:49.267 --> 11:51.267
AGNES: Careful, puppy.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.500
We don't want to
catch the puppy.

11:53.533 --> 11:57.133
Once it reaches about
halfways with the net,
we'll tie it off.

11:57.167 --> 11:58.633
CAROL: Sure.

12:00.667 --> 12:02.167
AGNES: Okay, watch
what he does, girls.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.633
He throws out the heavy stuff.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.200
I just need to tighten
it up a little bit.

12:18.533 --> 12:21.733
AGNES: The wind
has caught the boat.

12:29.400 --> 12:30.633
(GIRLS LAUGHING)

12:30.667 --> 12:32.200
AGNES: Whoa!

12:32.233 --> 12:33.500
Crazy!

12:34.767 --> 12:36.467
(AGNES LAUGHS)

12:36.500 --> 12:38.433
CHIP: When I was just
taking off, I felt a real
strong breeze

12:38.467 --> 12:41.600
and I was telling myself,
this must be what 50 miles an
hour feels like on this boat,

12:41.633 --> 12:42.533
'cause of the gust.

12:42.567 --> 12:44.600
But it just brought
my nose up.

12:44.633 --> 12:47.167
AGNES: Wow, that was crazy!

12:47.200 --> 12:50.133
You were straight
up like this.

12:50.167 --> 12:52.300
That was a close call.
Anything could've happened.

12:52.333 --> 12:55.767
His boat motor prop
could've get caught
to him or slashed him.

12:55.800 --> 13:01.333
We're a long ways from help,
and that could get to a real
scary situation real quick.

13:01.367 --> 13:02.800
CHIP: Whoo, man!
The wind had me up.

13:02.833 --> 13:04.300
Once I got out of the wind,
you see me come down?

13:04.333 --> 13:06.400
-Yeah.
-That was fucking crazy, huh?

13:06.433 --> 13:08.433
I couldn't figure out what
the hell was holding me up,

13:08.467 --> 13:11.700
and then when I felt the wind,
the gust go down,
it was like, "Whoa."

13:11.733 --> 13:13.667
And the boat came right down.

13:13.700 --> 13:16.367
AGNES: Sometimes they
hit right as soon as you
throw your net out.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.800
-Pretty soon, when the tide
comes up, more of the net...
-The fish will come in.

13:19.833 --> 13:25.167
...will be up and the
fish will come right in
with the high tide.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.100
Well, now that this
is done anyway, and that's
the best part of it all.

13:28.133 --> 13:29.500
This will be
productive pretty soon.

13:29.533 --> 13:31.167
Why don't you girls go get
some greens and berries,

13:31.200 --> 13:32.400
and we'll have
ourselves a salmon...

13:32.433 --> 13:34.600
-AGNES: Yeah.
-...greens and berry dinner.

13:34.633 --> 13:37.500
AGNES: And onions?
CHIP: And onions! Yes!

13:37.533 --> 13:39.800
We need some onions
for this project.

13:39.833 --> 13:40.900
AGNES: Ready girls?
QUTAN: Yup.

13:40.933 --> 13:42.800
AGNES: Let's go.
Right on!

13:42.833 --> 13:47.067
Our net will catch fish
while we go pick berries.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.800
GLENN: That's part of
the reason I'm here.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.700
To be connected to nature.

13:53.733 --> 13:56.500
It's just fascinating
all the stuff that's going on.

13:56.533 --> 13:58.367
Every year I learn
something new.

14:06.767 --> 14:09.700
This time of year
I'd like to get
some small game like

14:09.733 --> 14:13.167
ducks, or a porcupine would be
great, or even some fish.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.300
I never know.
I don't plan. When I leave,

14:15.333 --> 14:16.633
I'm just going looking
for food.

14:16.667 --> 14:18.600
Whatever I find,
I'll be happy with it.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.100
It's springtime.
Birds are coming back,

14:22.133 --> 14:25.067
bears are waking up,
the thaw is here.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.667
I see a couple of
ducks down here,

14:29.700 --> 14:32.633
just landed in the moat next
to the lake, so I'm gonna
take a walk down,

14:32.667 --> 14:34.700
see if I might be
able to get 'em.

14:38.067 --> 14:42.067
(WHISPERING)
Yeah, they are two pintails
right over here.

14:42.100 --> 14:43.400
I think I might be
able to get 'em

14:43.433 --> 14:45.567
but I just have to
be careful because

14:45.600 --> 14:47.833
if they take off, and
they're flying up very high,

14:47.867 --> 14:50.767
they could fall out
on that ice, and I'll never
be able to get 'em.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.467
The ice is too
thin to walk on.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.400
I've got to make
sure they're in the water.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.067
(GUN FIRING)

15:02.733 --> 15:03.733
(GUN COCKING)

15:05.067 --> 15:06.233
(GUN FIRING)

15:08.067 --> 15:10.733
GLENN: I just got two ducks.

15:10.767 --> 15:12.300
Luckily they're not drifting.

15:12.333 --> 15:14.400
There's a little breeze coming
and going, so I just want to

15:14.433 --> 15:17.200
go down right away and get 'em
before anything changes.

15:17.233 --> 15:21.333
Sometimes the hardest part
of getting a duck is getting
it out of the water.

15:23.800 --> 15:27.300
It's a fairly large duck,
so that's good,

15:27.333 --> 15:28.933
but I have to go out and
get that one,

15:28.967 --> 15:31.167
the water's a little bit
deep there,

15:31.200 --> 15:34.133
and I don't want to
get my clothes all wet.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.533
So I've got to get out there.

15:47.233 --> 15:49.867
Jesus,
that water's cold.

15:49.900 --> 15:55.367
I'm standing on ice.
There's ice on the bottom.

15:57.100 --> 16:00.500
Oh, those should be tasty,
'cause pintails are

16:00.533 --> 16:03.300
some of the better ducks
out here for eating, you know.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.633
They're good tasting duck.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.633
They live on vegetation,
mostly,

16:06.667 --> 16:11.067
little insects, things.
But different ducks
have different flavours.

16:13.067 --> 16:14.433
I don't like to plan
too far in advance,

16:14.467 --> 16:16.333
and it's the same thing with
what I'm gonna eat.

16:16.367 --> 16:18.333
I'm gonna eat whatever
nature provides.

16:18.367 --> 16:19.733
Today it provided two ducks,

16:19.767 --> 16:23.133
so that'll be what
I have for dinner.

16:23.167 --> 16:24.400
Hunting's an
uncertain business.

16:24.433 --> 16:26.200
I never know how things
are going to turn out.

16:26.233 --> 16:27.500
I missed two ducks and

16:27.533 --> 16:29.700
ended up getting another
two a little bit later.

16:29.733 --> 16:32.233
I got two ducks. I'm gonna
bring them back to camp,

16:32.267 --> 16:34.533
cook 'em up, have dinner.

16:36.600 --> 16:38.667
ANDY: I do this
for me and for Kate.

16:38.700 --> 16:40.233
It's not to impress anybody.

16:40.267 --> 16:42.233
I could care less about that.

16:42.267 --> 16:45.067
It's what do I need to
do to satisfy myself

16:45.067 --> 16:48.467
and to feel good about
what it is I want out of life.

16:48.500 --> 16:49.800
(DOGS HOWLING)

16:58.200 --> 17:00.667
KATE: What's our plan?
We're gonna go
finish up the rock?

17:00.700 --> 17:02.600
You think we're gonna
be able to load all that now,

17:02.633 --> 17:04.867
and get it on the boat
and get out of there?

17:04.900 --> 17:08.367
NARRATOR: Yesterday, Andy
and Kate ventured 30
miles down the Yukon

17:08.400 --> 17:11.367
in search of materials
for an upcoming build.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.400
Now they must load over five
tons of stone by hand

17:14.433 --> 17:16.533
and freight it
safely back home.

17:21.433 --> 17:23.467
ANDY: Did that stake pull out?

17:24.600 --> 17:26.667
God damn it.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.233
The line holding the
army boat came loose

17:29.267 --> 17:33.367
and the army boat
drifted out to the middle
of the river with me.

17:39.500 --> 17:41.767
I touched
bottom with my prop.

17:43.400 --> 17:46.100
I felt it hit a rock
underneath there pretty good.

17:46.133 --> 17:50.167
So, that was probably
about a $250 oops.

17:59.567 --> 18:01.533
KATE: There's a
big rock right there.

18:02.467 --> 18:03.733
And right there.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.467
ANDY: Here's breakfast.

18:15.367 --> 18:17.933
-Ooh, man.
-KATE: What?

18:17.967 --> 18:20.300
ANDY: My prop
is just fried there.

18:20.333 --> 18:21.867
I don't want to
push it too much.

18:21.900 --> 18:26.600
I'll just limp home with that
prop. It's all beat up.

18:26.633 --> 18:30.233
If any of these are too heavy,
just let them go, okay?
I can load them.

18:30.267 --> 18:32.600
NARRATOR: Loading the boat
is only half the job.

18:32.633 --> 18:36.133
Andy and Kate still have half
a day's worth of work left,

18:36.167 --> 18:38.133
but the daylight is dwindling.

18:42.167 --> 18:43.433
Why don't you hand me
your bucket, Kate,

18:43.467 --> 18:46.067
and I'll fill up some of
these small pieces.

18:58.900 --> 19:00.633
ANDY: A little lighter?
KATE: Please.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.433
(ANDY LAUGHING)

19:07.133 --> 19:08.667
That was a good idea
to use the bucket.

19:08.700 --> 19:11.633
I hate ruining a good water
bucket, but it's definitely...

19:11.667 --> 19:14.467
KATE: Well, I took the one
that was melted down the side.

19:14.500 --> 19:15.767
Uh-huh, yeah, I see.

19:20.867 --> 19:22.300
I can get this one.

19:24.433 --> 19:27.533
If you're struggling
with it, I won't get it
off the ground. (LAUGHING)

19:34.200 --> 19:36.533
I think I might move
down to the next spot.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.700
ANDY: Watch your fingers!

19:51.600 --> 19:53.600
Argh, motherfucker!

19:53.633 --> 19:57.633
I got hit with a good sized
rock on my index finger.

19:59.633 --> 20:02.467
And it's going to
hurt for a long time.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.300
Well, why are
you throwing them,

20:05.333 --> 20:07.067
when you know I was fixing it?

20:07.100 --> 20:10.267
ANDY: I didn't see you
fixing it, I turned around
to throw it in.

20:10.300 --> 20:13.533
It's definitely bruised
and it's causing her
a little discomfort,

20:13.567 --> 20:16.433
but she's a tough girl.

20:16.467 --> 20:21.100
She's got a high threshold of
pain and she'll suck it up,
and she'll continue to work.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.667
You're all right.

20:22.700 --> 20:25.933
Shit happens when you're
moving heavy stuff
and when you're working.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.733
That's just the way
it is out here.

20:27.767 --> 20:29.533
(LAUGHING)

20:29.567 --> 20:30.733
It hurt hard, you know?

20:30.767 --> 20:32.433
ANDY: I know it hurts.
KATE: Yeah.

20:38.033 --> 20:41.467
ANDY: It's got to be
a good 150 pounds
or so, I would think.

20:42.900 --> 20:44.067
(GRUNTS)

20:50.033 --> 20:51.600
Yeah, buddy.

20:51.633 --> 20:53.467
Now, that's a rock.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.533
If I want to start loading
my silver boat,

20:55.567 --> 20:58.167
I think I got a load
in my army boat.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.267
Oh! (LAUGHING)

21:07.700 --> 21:09.067
You almost went swimming.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.767
Maybe you should take
a little break, Andy.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.500
ANDY: Nope.
We're almost done.
Take a break on the way home.

21:18.500 --> 21:20.567
I tend to overload boats.
I tend to

21:20.600 --> 21:23.533
push the limits when it comes
to doing this sort of thing.

21:24.267 --> 21:25.800
-You ready?
-Yup.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.633
ANDY: Come on off.

21:30.533 --> 21:31.900
KATE: Huh?

21:31.933 --> 21:34.367
I think we got it.

21:34.400 --> 21:36.300
We got about a
30-mile trip home.

21:36.333 --> 21:39.367
I really don't want these
bags sitting in the boats
that long. There's a lot of

21:39.400 --> 21:41.633
stress and pressure
on the boats.

21:41.667 --> 21:46.267
It's really hard on a riveted
boat to put this kind of
weight and pressure in it.

21:46.300 --> 21:48.300
Any time you're putting
a lot of weight in boats,

21:48.333 --> 21:51.467
there's always a
potential for disaster.

21:51.500 --> 21:53.467
Whether it be the
boat capsizing,

21:53.500 --> 21:56.633
heavy winds on the river
can put up a pretty big fetch.

22:02.133 --> 22:05.533
ANDY: That's what I feel
like doing, Iceberg.
(LAUGHING)

22:08.233 --> 22:12.333
I know what my capabilities
are, but at the same time,
you never know.

22:12.367 --> 22:16.133
There's always variables
that sometimes you
don't think about.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.533
SUE: I may make a mistake.

22:22.567 --> 22:26.067
It's okay because with each
mistake is an opportunity
to learn how to do it right.

22:37.667 --> 22:38.700
SUE: Flat.

22:41.367 --> 22:42.467
Tight.

22:42.500 --> 22:43.567
All righty.

22:43.600 --> 22:45.367
I'm ready to go.

22:45.400 --> 22:48.200
You know, to bring
the Nodwell out here,
you want to do the,

22:48.233 --> 22:51.367
you know, minimum impact
on the land around you,

22:51.400 --> 22:54.233
so I'll be keeping it
tight to the path.

22:54.267 --> 22:55.767
NARRATOR: With the help
of the Nodwell,

22:55.800 --> 22:59.267
Sue is moving her food
container closer to camp.

23:01.433 --> 23:04.067
Engine button
has to be in. I mean,

23:04.067 --> 23:05.867
these are old tank controls.

23:05.900 --> 23:07.300
This is how you turn.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.067
I have the gas pedal here.

23:10.067 --> 23:11.700
Gonna be going through
some bouncy stuff, man,

23:11.733 --> 23:13.933
so my foot's gonna
want to be bounce, bounce.

23:13.967 --> 23:16.100
I'm gonna use
the hand throttle.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.067
Let those glow plugs
heat up a little bit.

26:06.500 --> 26:10.467
I shot a little bit
too far west before
I started swinging in.

26:11.133 --> 26:12.567
New game plan is

26:12.600 --> 26:16.067
I'm gonna go take
it all the way around
and try a new approach.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.267
GLENN: Half the time
when I'm out here alone
walking around hunting,

26:21.300 --> 26:22.733
I don't even think in words.

26:26.167 --> 26:28.167
I just go where my
feelings lead me.

26:28.200 --> 26:31.667
I'm following my feelings
through the forest and
that's how I find things.

26:42.100 --> 26:44.167
Yeah, this is
a beautiful duck.

26:44.200 --> 26:48.800
Ducks have really nice down
all along the breast here,
I like to save that.

26:48.833 --> 26:51.467
If you get enough ducks,
you can make
a pillow out of it.

26:51.500 --> 26:55.767
So I just bring a bag
with me to put it in,
when I'm plucking 'em.

26:58.333 --> 27:01.233
You know, it's a useful thing.
Why throw it out?

27:01.267 --> 27:04.333
Why not save it and use it?

27:04.367 --> 27:06.933
I really enjoy
just sitting by a lake,
plucking a duck.

27:06.967 --> 27:08.633
It's just a beautiful thing to

27:08.667 --> 27:12.133
be listening to the birds
singing and feeling
the sunshine.

27:12.167 --> 27:14.533
There's nothing I'd rather
be doing right now.

27:17.400 --> 27:19.100
I'm gonna pluck the wings.

27:19.133 --> 27:21.600
The skin is where
a lot of fat is.

27:21.633 --> 27:23.400
The skin's the best part.

27:23.433 --> 27:25.367
I eat pretty much
everything on a duck,

27:25.400 --> 27:27.633
except for the bones,
the guts.

27:27.667 --> 27:30.533
I mean, that just depends
on how hungry I am, too.

27:34.600 --> 27:37.833
Clean these ducks and...
This is female.

27:37.867 --> 27:39.333
You never know, sometimes

27:39.367 --> 27:41.700
you get a surprise,
this time of year.

27:41.733 --> 27:43.900
You can get fresh eggs.

27:43.933 --> 27:47.067
Let's see what's in here.

27:47.067 --> 27:48.733
There's the heart.

27:52.233 --> 27:54.567
Duck liver, very good to eat.

27:57.967 --> 27:59.567
I always like the gizzard.

27:59.600 --> 28:01.633
Didn't get any eggs
out of this one.

28:01.667 --> 28:06.167
Not a lot of ducks around
here, and I never harass the
ones that nest here.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.267
There's usually
only one family of,

28:08.300 --> 28:09.833
of ducks that stay
on the lake.

28:09.867 --> 28:13.567
These ducks are
just passing through.

28:13.600 --> 28:18.067
Once I get a moose, I'm not
interested in much else,
to tell you the truth.

28:22.467 --> 28:25.367
I'm gonna get some
water and cook up my ducks.

28:25.400 --> 28:29.667
I mean, I'm sure it's full of
moose shit and whatever else,
but it gets boiled.

28:29.700 --> 28:32.800
I haven't got sick
off of it yet.

28:32.833 --> 28:35.767
So next step, add the ducks.

28:35.800 --> 28:38.633
Duck liver, couple of
duck hearts,

28:38.667 --> 28:40.167
couple of duck gizzards.

28:40.200 --> 28:44.333
Mix it all together,
have nice flavours, the broth
will be good to drink.

28:44.367 --> 28:46.500
Might as well throw
a duck head in there, too.

28:46.533 --> 28:47.900
It'll add a little
bit of flavour.

28:47.933 --> 28:50.333
Of course most of the meat's
right on the breast there.

28:50.367 --> 28:52.533
One duck, here's another duck.

28:52.567 --> 28:55.733
Looks pretty good.
Ducks for dinner.

29:02.533 --> 29:05.967
I'm gonna see
how my duck's doing.

29:06.067 --> 29:08.067
I think they should
be done by now.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.467
Oh, look at that.
Yeah. That's hot.

29:14.500 --> 29:16.600
Oh, I got some berries
to go with them, too.

29:16.633 --> 29:18.067
I'm pretty happy with it.

29:18.067 --> 29:19.500
I don't need anything fancy.

29:19.533 --> 29:21.900
Just some berries
and some duck meat.

29:21.933 --> 29:25.067
I'm all set.

29:25.067 --> 29:28.633
Duck head, I put this in
there just to add a little bit
of flavour to the broth,

29:28.667 --> 29:31.133
but there's probably a little
bit on it I can eat.

29:32.267 --> 29:33.333
Mmm,

29:34.867 --> 29:36.767
duck cheeks, pretty tasty.

29:40.133 --> 29:43.700
Ducks have great eyesight, so,

29:43.733 --> 29:46.233
some people think that
if you eat their eyes,

29:46.267 --> 29:48.300
it'll improve your eyesight.

29:52.267 --> 29:55.667
I was looking for
a new place where I could
get something like ducks

29:55.700 --> 29:59.833
or fish, porcupine,
and walked over here,
found some open water,

29:59.867 --> 30:01.533
and got these ducks.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.833
Mostly I don't have ducks.
So it's a special thing.

30:03.867 --> 30:06.567
They taste really good.
Mmm.

30:06.600 --> 30:07.867
It was a great day.

30:07.900 --> 30:09.433
I could stay here for a while.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.233
ANDY: I don't like using
the term "living off the land"

30:14.267 --> 30:17.633
because you're not living
off the land, you're living
with the land.

30:18.700 --> 30:21.600
You have to utilise
renewable resources.

30:34.467 --> 30:37.067
ANDY: We're almost
home, buddy.

30:40.033 --> 30:41.733
A lot of current here.

30:42.300 --> 30:44.333
Hope it's deep enough.

30:44.367 --> 30:49.267
Landing in shallow water
along the Yukon is always
a little bit challenging.

30:49.300 --> 30:52.067
I'm usually pretty careful,
but when you've got
a big load like this

30:52.100 --> 30:54.633
and you're trying to get
your boat into the shore,
it makes it

30:54.667 --> 30:56.867
double challenging to
try and get on and off

30:56.900 --> 30:58.767
without touching the bottom.

31:10.067 --> 31:11.800
KATE: Yeah.
ANDY: A little farther.

31:13.300 --> 31:15.400
ANDY: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

31:15.433 --> 31:18.067
That felt like an awful
hard rock it came on.

31:23.267 --> 31:25.400
Man, that's a long ways out.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.433
Put a wrap on it
right there, Kate.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.867
ANDY: My bulldozer
doesn't have good brakes,

31:36.900 --> 31:40.767
so if I can't put something
to kind of stop it from
rolling back into the river,

31:40.800 --> 31:44.533
it makes it way more
complicated for me to
get these rocks out.

31:44.567 --> 31:47.700
I really don't want to
bop over this edge
if I can help it.

31:49.267 --> 31:51.633
I don't know if I can
reach that far back,
but we're gonna try it.

31:51.667 --> 31:53.967
So when it starts to lift,
where do you want me to go?

31:54.067 --> 31:57.400
-Back here or run up there?
-Probably just
up in the front is fine.

32:11.067 --> 32:13.267
I usually stay in the
boat and hook the bags

32:13.300 --> 32:16.133
so that he can pull them
out with the bulldozer.

32:18.533 --> 32:21.300
There's a real potential
for disaster here.

32:35.233 --> 32:37.100
KATE: I got to move.

32:43.367 --> 32:45.667
ANDY: I knew once I started
taking the weight off the boat

32:45.700 --> 32:49.067
and it started dragging
on the bottom, it was gonna
pull that boat in.

32:49.100 --> 32:51.633
It was starting to swing there
over my head, and I was

32:51.667 --> 32:56.600
not gonna stay there
with a ton of rocks
on top of my head.

32:56.633 --> 32:58.600
NARRATOR: Kate learned
her lesson last summer,

32:58.633 --> 33:00.800
after a potentially
deadly mistake.

33:00.833 --> 33:04.400
Hey, don't go underneath it.
Get the hell away from it!

33:04.433 --> 33:06.767
Don't ever walk
underneath that, Kate.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.833
That's just not smart.

33:08.867 --> 33:13.767
She's starting to develop
some natural instincts from
moving all this heavy crap.

33:17.267 --> 33:19.100
Every rock we move
in that house

33:19.133 --> 33:23.133
is going into our dream
fireplace and our heating
system for the home.

33:23.167 --> 33:26.200
And it's gonna make
for a beautiful home
when we're all done.

33:47.867 --> 33:51.267
Now, we just
finished bringing the rocks
up from the boats,

33:51.300 --> 33:53.500
no major hassles.

33:53.533 --> 33:55.067
I damaged a prop.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.867
Kate's got a
bruised up finger.

33:56.900 --> 34:01.167
I think we did pretty good
considering the potential
dangers that we're up against.

34:01.200 --> 34:03.400
It wasn't all about just
getting rocks, it was about

34:03.433 --> 34:05.233
Kate and I spending
some time together and

34:05.267 --> 34:09.433
getting some dogs out,
and trying to enjoy
the country a little bit.

34:09.467 --> 34:13.200
I think we'll get the
sauna going and go
get a cold beer and

34:13.233 --> 34:17.633
spend the rest of the day
relaxing, and then we'll be
at it again tomorrow.

34:21.867 --> 34:25.300
CHIP: We're not some
sort of crude and rude bunch
of people trying to

34:25.333 --> 34:27.700
make some sort of
primitive existence.

34:28.633 --> 34:30.067
We flourish here.

34:30.067 --> 34:31.800
This stuff works
really well for us.

34:44.933 --> 34:46.533
CHIP: Check it out,
the net is sunk.

34:46.567 --> 34:49.267
AGNES: Oh!
CHIP: Every float is down.

34:49.300 --> 34:52.600
-So I think we got a full net.
-(AGNES SPEAKING)

34:57.533 --> 35:01.267

Good dog.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.867
CAROL: Hey!
CHIP: All right, we're good.

35:02.900 --> 35:04.600
AGNES: No, puppy.
CHIP: Stay back, puppy.

35:08.300 --> 35:09.967
Just take us to the net.

35:10.067 --> 35:12.300
Uh-uh, we're not leaving you.

35:12.333 --> 35:14.933
CHIP: It's a good feeling to
provide for my family
and it's a good feeling

35:14.967 --> 35:17.133
to show my family how
to provide for themselves.

35:17.167 --> 35:20.867
And that's really my goal,
not just tell them about it
or let them read about it.

35:20.900 --> 35:22.733
I want them to
participate in it.

35:26.633 --> 35:28.200
AGNES: Okay.

35:28.233 --> 35:30.433
Oh! Ew!

35:30.467 --> 35:32.467
-Leave that in.
-(AGNES LAUGHING)

35:32.500 --> 35:34.767
CHIP: Some of these
fish have been upriver,
and they've spawned.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.467
-See how it looks rotten?
-QUTAN: Mmm-hmm.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.333
The body, their body,
is virtually rotten.
Throw it that way.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.400
AGNES: Ugh.

35:44.533 --> 35:46.967
CHIP: Kiwalik River is
the place to be in the
summertime for us.

35:47.067 --> 35:49.067
It's a place
we know very well.

35:49.067 --> 35:52.467
We are hunters and fishers,
and a very important thing is
to know your hunting grounds.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.667
We're into what we
know is rock solid.

35:54.700 --> 35:56.667
And we rock solid
know the Kiwalik.

35:56.700 --> 36:00.467
This is a really good place to
fish, it always has been,
always probably will be.

36:00.500 --> 36:02.867
And the fact is I want
my daughters to be
good providers,

36:02.900 --> 36:06.333
and they'll have kids
and they'll need to
take care of things.

36:06.367 --> 36:07.967
AGNES: These are all alive.

36:08.067 --> 36:10.067
This one is a female.
It got eggs in it.

36:10.100 --> 36:13.267
CHIP: Oh, good. That one
will make a good smoker, then.

36:13.300 --> 36:16.133
AGNES: Wow, look at this one.
This is a silver?

36:16.167 --> 36:19.433
CHIP: Yep, might be
our first silver this year.

36:28.400 --> 36:30.433
CHIP: No, don't worry,
if you cut, I'll take over.

36:30.467 --> 36:32.467
AGNES: This one is alive.
That's why you girls have to

36:32.500 --> 36:34.600
watch out when the fish
are alive and they start...

36:34.633 --> 36:38.733
QUTAN: Mom, can you get this?
AGNES: ...moving around
all freaky ways.

36:40.133 --> 36:44.167

colourful one.
Was that all of them?

(QUTAN AND AGNES SPEAKING)

36:48.900 --> 36:51.233

Well, that's a good hunt.

37:00.733 --> 37:03.067
CHIP: Look at all the
water gushing in up front.

37:03.100 --> 37:04.967
It's really flowing in
up front.

37:05.067 --> 37:08.067
More than anything I want to
get them out of here because
the boat's sinking.

37:10.167 --> 37:13.700
This motor is putting
too much water in the boat,
so I'm gonna go to shore.

37:13.733 --> 37:16.133
If we keep this up, we're just
gonna end up sinking.

37:17.200 --> 37:18.567
It's a tired old boat.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.067
And it's been retired
to a net-checker.

37:20.100 --> 37:23.067
It floats long enough
to check the net.

37:23.067 --> 37:25.367
AGNES: We got a boatload here.

37:25.400 --> 37:27.700
AGNES: Qutan, grab fish
and jump out.
QUTAN: Okay, okay.

37:27.733 --> 37:29.833
CHIP: Get out of my boat.
Look, you don't realise
how much weight

37:29.867 --> 37:32.067
we're throwing around here.
We have a lot of water
in the boat,

37:32.100 --> 37:34.233
a lot of fish in the boat,
and when you're going
back and forth,

37:34.267 --> 37:35.600
you're making
it real unstable.

37:35.633 --> 37:37.533
So if you just stay right
there, I'll throw you a fish.

37:37.567 --> 37:42.567
When we get to shore,
that boat's loaded up
with fish and water.

37:42.600 --> 37:45.800
And if we'd let it sit there
like another 10 minutes,
it would have sunk.

37:57.200 --> 38:00.333
AGNES: That's a silver.
You can tell that's different
from the rest of them.

salmon, pinks and silvers.

stomach off.

38:19.467 --> 38:22.467
Cut the bones off
right at the tail.

38:25.167 --> 38:27.733
Nice little haul
we've got going here.

38:27.767 --> 38:30.567
Instead of using
lots of little this kind cuts,

38:30.600 --> 38:32.567
I always go like this,
the whole thing with your ulu.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.600
Start from the top
and use your whole ulu
till you go to the back.

38:37.300 --> 38:39.267

doubts. They have no doubts.

fed in a farm.

This wasn't put in a pen out
to sea and given antibiotics
and growth hormones.

But I'm willing to
try everything.

39:41.067 --> 39:45.900
NARRATOR: Sue's first attempt
at moving her food container
to a safer location failed.

39:45.933 --> 39:49.767
Now, with a higher risk of
failure, she'll try again.

39:49.800 --> 39:53.367
The first time I did the
distance, which is half of
what I'm gonna do now,

39:53.400 --> 39:55.633
this thing started smoking
and cut itself out.

39:55.667 --> 39:58.467
So, it's a concern
it does it again.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.300
But I got to get it done.

40:45.667 --> 40:47.233
SUE: Fuck!

40:47.267 --> 40:50.667
-Goddamn, son of
a fucking bitch.
-RICK: You'll get it.

40:52.167 --> 40:53.333
(ENGINE RUMBLES)

40:59.900 --> 41:01.700
(SUE SPEAKING)

41:02.700 --> 41:04.200
(RICK SPEAKING)

41:12.667 --> 41:14.267
Whew.

41:15.633 --> 41:16.600
That was pretty touch-and-go.

41:16.633 --> 41:19.067
I thought this thing
was gonna fry.

41:19.100 --> 41:20.567
The engine's
overheating itself,

41:20.600 --> 41:22.667
might have blown a little
oil gasket, I don't know.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.300
I don't see anything
leaking, just oil.

41:24.333 --> 41:27.367
Could be the old shit burning
off. But it killed itself.

41:27.400 --> 41:30.367
Let's go out and see
what kind of trouble I caused.

41:35.767 --> 41:37.533
SUE: That ain't too bad.

41:38.633 --> 41:40.533
This is doable.

41:40.567 --> 41:44.167
It will block a little
bit of my view

41:44.200 --> 41:46.300
for what's coming
at me this way.

41:46.333 --> 41:51.167
But I'm only so many
yards from the food

41:51.200 --> 41:53.100
when it's dark out,

41:53.133 --> 41:57.067
when it's blowing a gale.
If I need something,
it's here.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.800
I'm not going a mile.

42:04.767 --> 42:06.533
(RICK SPEAKING)

42:11.367 --> 42:13.200
SUE: This gives
me peace of mind.

42:13.233 --> 42:17.700
It's something that I saw
that could be improved,
and I did it.

42:17.733 --> 42:21.567
And I'm going into winter,
a little bit better than I was
just about five minutes ago.

42:33.733 --> 42:38.100
Just got back from
putting the Nodwell to bed
over in the boneyard.

42:38.933 --> 42:41.567
The Nodwell did really well.

42:41.600 --> 42:46.633
Yeah, I swore a lot at it,
but it's still kicking

42:46.667 --> 42:48.367
just like I am.

42:48.400 --> 42:52.233
You know, we're both
maybe past our prime
to other people but

42:52.267 --> 42:55.767
there's a lot left in store
coming out of me and it.

42:55.800 --> 42:58.600
So, it's a good day.
