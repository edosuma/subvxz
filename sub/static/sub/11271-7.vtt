OLD FLAMES

00:08.957 --> 00:11.710
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

00:11.877 --> 00:15.464
- How's life?
- It's not going to win any awards.

00:15.631 --> 00:17.674
Put a brew in my face, please.

00:17.841 --> 00:20.552
- Right up.
- What have you been up to?

00:20.719 --> 00:26.015
I went out for the first time
since Vera and I split up.

00:26.182 --> 00:28.476
Who was the lucky damseI?

00:28.643 --> 00:34.357
Arlene Horsley. She's a typist
at that firm I got fired from.

00:34.524 --> 00:40.780
I gave her a slice of my pizza one day.
Things took off from there.

00:40.947 --> 00:43.406
We caught a movie this afternoon.

00:43.573 --> 00:46.535
- What was playing?
- "Gandhi".

00:46.701 --> 00:50.705
"Gandhi". Fine piece
of cinematic art there.

00:51.873 --> 00:54.501
- I'm out of here.
- Where you going?

00:54.668 --> 00:58.088
I gotta get back
before Arlene misses me.

00:58.255 --> 01:01.090
- Where is she?
- Watching "Gandhi".

01:01.257 --> 01:06.887
I'm just out for popcorn. See you
in an hour when I go out for jujubes.

01:08.000 --> 01:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:21.499 --> 02:24.501
We did. Thank you for
a wonderfuI afternoon.

02:24.668 --> 02:27.421
Right. My heart's still pounding.

02:31.717 --> 02:35.053
If you have something to say,
come right out and say it.

02:36.096 --> 02:38.265
All right.

02:39.849 --> 02:45.897
- What is your problem?
- There is no bigger romantic than me.

02:46.063 --> 02:51.736
But if you two are going to do stuff
like that, do it out by the garbage.

02:54.363 --> 03:00.118
Even you cannot ruin our mood. We had
a wonderfuI afternoon gallery haunting.

03:00.285 --> 03:03.705
We saw the work
of New England's finest artists.

03:03.872 --> 03:06.166
Did you lose a bet, Sam?

03:10.629 --> 03:16.425
Mr Malone is developing an appreciation
of non-representationaI art.

03:16.592 --> 03:19.637
- That's right.
- Name any art you saw today.

03:22.431 --> 03:24.558
There were so many.

03:25.518 --> 03:28.395
Name any piece of art in the world.

03:30.563 --> 03:34.192
- A buck says he gets this one.
- You're on.

03:35.318 --> 03:39.822
Michelangelo's "Two Muscular Guys
Touching Fingers".

03:40.907 --> 03:44.410
- Pay up.
- Fooled me.

03:48.372 --> 03:50.999
Why?

03:51.166 --> 03:56.046
Diane, I wouldn't try too hard
to domesticate the guy.

03:56.213 --> 03:59.258
You're going against eons of biology.

04:00.425 --> 04:02.677
What are you talking about?

04:02.843 --> 04:08.474
Early cavemen went out and hunted
for the food that graced their table.

04:08.641 --> 04:12.812
Women stayed in the cave
and developed art and culture.

04:12.979 --> 04:18.733
Men, through the centuries, have always
been hunters. Doers. Adventurers.

04:18.901 --> 04:23.697
<i>Cogito, it is not in man's nature
to sit alone and be docile.</i>

04:26.116 --> 04:30.078
- What's the matter?
- My shorts are binding up on me.

04:38.252 --> 04:40.504
Just straighten them out.

04:40.671 --> 04:45.676
No, I'll give them five minutes.
Sometimes they self-correct.

04:50.139 --> 04:54.684
The leveI of conversation in this bar
could not sink lower.

04:56.436 --> 04:58.855
Hiya, wonder-buns.

05:00.982 --> 05:03.985
- Going down...
- Dave Richards!

05:04.152 --> 05:06.195
Hi, sports fans.

05:06.362 --> 05:09.281
What did you say at the end
of your sports report last night?

05:09.448 --> 05:12.534
I said, "Good night and remember

05:12.701 --> 05:18.707
"the world is full of winners and losers.
Here's hoping you're one of them. "

05:20.042 --> 05:22.544
I guess I did hear it right.

05:25.464 --> 05:28.841
- Hey, big fella.
- How're you doing, Mayday?

05:29.008 --> 05:32.094
- Good. How are you, Dave?
- Miserable.

05:32.261 --> 05:35.765
- Brenda and I split.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

05:35.931 --> 05:41.312
This is from the heart. This is the most
devastating period of my life.

05:41.479 --> 05:46.816
- You want to talk about it?
- No. Fall off a horse, you get back on.

05:46.983 --> 05:51.237
Sam, how about you and me
giving the females of Boston

05:51.404 --> 05:54.699
ten minutes head start,
then round them up?

05:54.866 --> 05:58.328
We did have fun, didn't we?
We were pretty good.

05:58.495 --> 06:02.956
I was wondering.
What was the best night we ever had?

06:03.123 --> 06:09.421
That's tough. I think I'd have to say
July 4th, Chicago.

06:10.464 --> 06:12.591
Yankee Doodle?

06:14.384 --> 06:18.387
- I was thinking about Minneapolis.
- It was great.

06:18.554 --> 06:22.391
But that was quantity. I'm talking quality.

06:22.558 --> 06:26.938
Was there a night when
there was both quantity and quality?

06:27.104 --> 06:29.524
Vegas!

06:29.690 --> 06:34.611
- What are we waiting for?
- Nothing. Don't wait up for us.

06:34.778 --> 06:38.949
Females of Boston, stop dreaming.
It's on its way.

06:39.115 --> 06:44.496
See you later, sweetheart. Take care,
Dave. Don't you be a stranger now.

06:44.663 --> 06:47.874
Don't you be a stranger.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.961
Did you get a chance to say hi to Dave?
Good old guy.

06:52.127 --> 06:55.339
Where were you going with him?

06:55.506 --> 07:00.844
Where am I? Last thing I remember,
I was standing behind the bar.

07:01.095 --> 07:03.931
Coach, I'm having blackouts.

07:04.098 --> 07:07.517
Kind of a nice break in the day, isn't it?

07:08.601 --> 07:10.353
Sam, what gives?

07:10.520 --> 07:14.774
I'm not going to make it to the aquarium
with you today. I'm sorry.

07:14.941 --> 07:19.529
I know where you were going.
You were going trollop hunting.

07:20.947 --> 07:23.991
That sounds fun.
Can you do that with women?

07:24.157 --> 07:27.911
Wait. Listen. I was not thinking, Diane.

07:28.078 --> 07:31.957
It was just an automatic reaction,
that's all.

07:32.124 --> 07:38.338
You're not going to tell me that you and
human brain have got something going?

07:40.423 --> 07:43.718
Well, kind of, yeah.

07:43.884 --> 07:46.387
Definitely. I mean, totally.

07:49.056 --> 07:51.142
Very romantic phrasing.

07:51.309 --> 07:53.394
You must be one hot honey.

07:53.561 --> 08:00.608
Take it easy. We've got a good thing
going here and I'm very proud of it.

08:00.775 --> 08:05.572
- Speaking of things going... Dave?
- I'll talk to you later.

08:05.739 --> 08:09.993
OK. I'll come back when you've split up.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.203
I've got about an hour to kill.

08:14.663 --> 08:19.918
- Listen, this is going to work out.
- Who are you talking to here?

08:20.085 --> 08:23.839
You were a worse hound than me.
The worst hound ever.

08:24.006 --> 08:27.384
David, that has all changed now.

08:27.551 --> 08:33.972
Some things never change. You cannot
give an old leopard new stripes.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.518
Why are we talking to him?

08:37.684 --> 08:42.356
I have nothing against you.
I just want my buddy back.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.692
I say I can break you two up.

08:44.859 --> 08:48.987
<i>Tomorrow, we will be out scouting
those el feminitos.</i>

08:49.154 --> 08:52.908
You're wrong. There's no way.
You're out of line.

08:54.201 --> 08:58.538
24 hours, you two are bye-bye.
Bye-bye.

08:58.705 --> 09:03.292
Do you believe that? That's ridiculous.

09:03.459 --> 09:10.257
Sam, he can give us 24 hours,
24 days, 24 years.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.219
We have transcended time.

09:13.385 --> 09:17.223
Right now the important thing
is the next 24 hours.

09:17.389 --> 09:24.187
Just to be on the safe side, let's not
even get into a heated discussion today.

09:24.354 --> 09:27.774
- Sure. That's easy.
- Good. I hope so.

09:27.941 --> 09:33.363
The truth is, we've never gone 24 hours
without a fight.

09:33.530 --> 09:36.573
- We most certainly have.
- We haven't.

09:36.740 --> 09:39.993
- Sam Malone...
- You're right.

09:40.160 --> 09:44.915
The important thing is no arguing,
no fighting, no break-up.

09:45.082 --> 09:47.835
I couldn't agree more.

09:51.213 --> 09:57.343
Sam. Seeing as you're going to be
out of commission, or so you say,

09:57.510 --> 10:01.347
could you give me the number
of that Lydia chick?

10:01.514 --> 10:03.766
You're impossible.

10:05.893 --> 10:08.104
Cliff! The book!

10:12.566 --> 10:14.317
This still her number?

10:14.484 --> 10:18.446
Come on.
You're smudging Judy Wilson's number.

10:21.074 --> 10:23.994
Thanks, buddy. See you, gang.

10:24.160 --> 10:26.537
Oh, and, moonbeam...

10:28.122 --> 10:32.585
Seeing as you'll be split up tomorrow,
maybe you and I...

10:32.751 --> 10:37.131
I'd rather be staked out on an ant hill,
naked.

10:40.134 --> 10:43.428
See how they always get the word
"naked" in?

10:43.595 --> 10:46.347
Go on.

10:49.225 --> 10:54.188
What a sleazy, egotisticaI, greasy,
rotten sewer rat.

10:54.355 --> 10:56.858
- You're right.
- I think I'm in love.

10:58.526 --> 11:02.362
Diane, I'm glad that jerk came by today.

11:02.529 --> 11:07.617
Moments like that make me realise
what a good thing we got going.

11:07.784 --> 11:12.080
- Why do you still have that thing?
- What's that, babe?

11:12.247 --> 11:14.291
The book.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.043
Why are you keeping it?

11:18.210 --> 11:25.426
Sweetheart, this is my address book.
I've got emergency numbers in this.

11:31.974 --> 11:36.144
What emergency service does
Wanda Mendelsohn render?

11:36.311 --> 11:38.730
She's an all-night plumber.

11:43.401 --> 11:48.656
The only plumber in Boston
you have to go to her house.

11:50.033 --> 11:54.286
Why are you holding onto
phone numbers of other women?

11:54.453 --> 11:58.624
I just haven't gotten around
to getting rid of it.

11:58.791 --> 12:03.212
Fine. Then you won't mind
if I help you with that. Cliff.

12:05.881 --> 12:08.758
Cliff, you touched it!

12:10.343 --> 12:12.929
I can see!

12:14.347 --> 12:17.475
- Normie, I can walk!
- He's walking!

12:17.642 --> 12:22.522
- Hallelujah!
- Cliff's walking! He's walking!

12:24.064 --> 12:29.861
I'm just saying it would be a wonderfuI
gesture to me if you destroyed the book.

12:30.862 --> 12:36.201
Are you nuts? It took me years
to meet all these people!

12:36.368 --> 12:40.579
- And even longer to alphabetise them.
- All right!

12:40.746 --> 12:43.249
I knew you'd bring up stupid.

12:43.415 --> 12:46.085
Arguing with you begins and ends with it.

12:46.252 --> 12:51.298
You can put up with this
if I can put up with paint splatters.

12:51.465 --> 12:57.929
Paint splatters? If brains were money,
you'd need a loan for a cup of coffee.

12:58.096 --> 13:00.723
I got that one!

13:02.225 --> 13:05.395
You're making marvellous progress.

13:05.562 --> 13:08.898
What's not making progress
is you and me.

13:09.065 --> 13:13.403
- We can change that.
- Whatever. I'm keeping that book.

13:13.570 --> 13:18.365
And you know where you can keep it?
Right straight...

13:18.532 --> 13:22.160
...under the pillow you dream on, big guy.

13:40.266 --> 13:42.351
Sam, got a minute?

13:42.518 --> 13:48.022
I just wanted to congratulate you on
your falling-out with miss chicken-parts.

13:48.189 --> 13:51.484
Take this opportunity
to make it permanent.

13:51.651 --> 13:55.238
Whenever we fight,
you just love to gloat.

13:55.405 --> 13:59.451
No, Sam. In fact,
I feeI a little sad about this one.

13:59.617 --> 14:02.704
- Why?
- I wasn't the cause of it.

14:06.206 --> 14:12.546
I don't know. Maybe me and Diane
being together doesn't make any sense.

14:12.713 --> 14:16.633
Love, Sam. Who can explain it?
Fools have tried.

14:16.800 --> 14:20.095
- You're right.
- I've got this theory.

14:20.262 --> 14:23.389
- Coach, would you take me home?
- OK.

14:23.556 --> 14:27.602
Every night you forget your keys.
Have you got them?

14:27.768 --> 14:32.356
It's OK. I got it all figured out.
I left them in the car.

14:32.523 --> 14:36.194
- You're not afraid it will get stolen?
- I locked it.

14:36.360 --> 14:40.197
- How will you get in without keys?
- I made a duplicate set.

14:40.363 --> 14:43.283
- Where are they?
- Holy mackereI!

14:45.911 --> 14:48.955
Carla, we've got to make a scramble.

14:49.122 --> 14:52.918
Looks like rain. Come on.
I left the windows open.

15:06.263 --> 15:09.934
Are you deep in thought
about how much you love me

15:10.100 --> 15:12.143
or are you not talking to me?

15:12.310 --> 15:17.523
I hate you with the white-hot intensity
of 1,000 suns.

15:18.650 --> 15:21.110
Somebody's cranky.

15:25.698 --> 15:31.495
Tell you what. As a gesture, to put
all this behind us, I'll take this book...

15:31.662 --> 15:37.584
I see. You're going to patch it up
so you don't lose face with Dave.

15:37.751 --> 15:42.422
No, forget about Dave.
I'm concerned about us right now.

15:42.589 --> 15:47.885
I'm going to take this book,
which represents my past,

15:48.052 --> 15:52.598
and I'm gonna rip up X through Z
and all but one of Q.

15:56.727 --> 16:01.189
You just don't understand.
There's nothing more to say.

16:22.918 --> 16:28.007
- Well, there he is. Isn't he pretty?
- What do you want, Dave?

16:28.173 --> 16:31.510
Was that Diane I saw leaving?

16:31.677 --> 16:37.140
Yeah, she had to go home early. She
has pictures of me she wants to hang.

16:38.266 --> 16:41.602
- I'm in a bind.
- You don't look too bad off.

16:41.769 --> 16:45.273
The one on the left is Valerie.
The other's Didi.

16:45.440 --> 16:50.778
- Can you take one off my hands?
- What is this? Part of your plan?

16:50.944 --> 16:54.030
Come on. I'm asking a favour
from a buddy.

16:54.197 --> 16:58.618
Ordinarily I wouldn't ask,
but Valerie thinks I'm complex.

17:00.245 --> 17:03.623
Need I say more?
Just see that she gets home.

17:03.790 --> 17:09.127
- Give me a break.
- Just see that she gets home. OK?

17:09.295 --> 17:14.675
Thanks. Valerie? What do you say
you and I jump in that Dave-mobile?

17:17.720 --> 17:21.432
So Didi, where do you live?

17:21.598 --> 17:24.018
Chicago.

17:24.185 --> 17:27.729
- Excuse me?
- Chicago. It's in Illinois.

17:27.896 --> 17:32.942
- I know where Chicago is, but...
- I'm just here overnight.

17:33.109 --> 17:36.821
I'm a stewardess.
I'm at the Stafford HoteI.

17:39.032 --> 17:44.703
- Why don't you let me call you a cab?
- Well, OK.

17:44.870 --> 17:48.665
Dave said you were a fun guy.

17:48.832 --> 17:52.961
I used to be a fun guy before I met...

17:55.797 --> 17:59.050
Before I met you.
Now I'm a really fun guy.

17:59.217 --> 18:02.470
- All right!
- Stafford HoteI? All right.

18:10.186 --> 18:13.856
How come you're not
out with Arlene tonight?

18:14.981 --> 18:17.526
Oh, gee, I am.

18:19.945 --> 18:23.573
- Where are you gonna be?
- I think the circus.

18:23.740 --> 18:28.453
No, that's tomorrow.
We're on a balcony somewhere.

18:33.499 --> 18:39.838
- I thought it was your turn to drive.
- Did I forget to pick you up, Carla?

18:40.005 --> 18:43.801
- I'm sorry. I'll make it up to you.
- It's OK.

18:43.968 --> 18:47.680
No. Tomorrow, you forget to pick me up.

18:49.472 --> 18:53.268
- Coach, is Sam in yet?
- No, he's not.

18:53.434 --> 18:56.437
FeeI a case of the nags coming on?

18:56.604 --> 19:02.277
I deserve that.
Actually, I wanted to apologise to him.

19:04.445 --> 19:08.073
I made too big a deaI
of that address book.

19:10.742 --> 19:13.203
But he was being insensitive.

19:15.163 --> 19:17.708
I guess I should learn to controI myself.

19:19.668 --> 19:22.962
I still think Sam was wrong.

19:25.840 --> 19:29.552
- Cheers.
- Coach, that ringing is in your head.

19:29.719 --> 19:32.430
I'm sorry.

19:32.596 --> 19:35.975
Coach, I don't blame you
for being confused.

19:36.142 --> 19:39.436
My relationship with Sam
is making me crazy.

19:39.602 --> 19:42.981
And you used to be so together.

19:45.191 --> 19:50.989
- Diane, I got something to tell you.
- I'm sorry the way I reacted yesterday.

19:51.156 --> 19:54.325
- I had a miserable night.
- It's all right.

19:54.492 --> 19:57.369
You're gonna love this. It's so good.

19:57.536 --> 19:59.955
Great! I can't wait either!

20:05.753 --> 20:10.007
- Coach, your phone's ringing.
- No, it's in my head.

20:12.675 --> 20:16.095
The big guy's chair. Tell me.

20:16.262 --> 20:22.018
Diane, last night, I took a beautifuI
woman back to my place.

20:22.185 --> 20:25.521
She was ready, willing and able
and so was I.

20:25.688 --> 20:29.107
We were right in the sack,
then all of a sudden

20:29.274 --> 20:33.528
I stopped, I thought
about how much you mean to me,

20:33.695 --> 20:37.157
and I said,
"I can't do this. I got a chick. "

20:40.494 --> 20:43.580
What do you think about that?

20:48.250 --> 20:53.839
Well, I was expecting a hug or a kiss,
but this is more personaI, I guess.

20:57.051 --> 21:00.971
- How could you?
- Diane, this is good news!

21:01.138 --> 21:05.350
You go to bed with another woman
and this is good news?

21:05.517 --> 21:10.772
You're not getting the big picture.
This is the first time I said no.

21:10.939 --> 21:15.443
And she was gorgeous. Not a man
in the world would say no to her.

21:15.610 --> 21:18.737
Not many women either, I'll tell you that.

21:18.904 --> 21:23.325
Besides, you and I were
as good as broken up.

21:23.492 --> 21:28.330
The only thing as good as broken up
is being broken up. And we are.

21:28.497 --> 21:31.625
Come on.
Don't you see what this means?

21:31.792 --> 21:33.835
Damn it!

21:34.961 --> 21:37.755
Your 24 hours is about up.

21:41.842 --> 21:45.429
Do I sense tension in this room?

21:45.596 --> 21:50.059
That was a crumby thing you did,
pushing Didi on me like that.

21:50.226 --> 21:54.437
If Diane and I didn't have
such a good thing going here

21:54.604 --> 21:57.607
that might have split us up.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.694
Come on. You two? Good thing going?

22:00.860 --> 22:05.031
I get along better with my wife
and we've exchanged gunfire.

22:06.241 --> 22:09.034
- You'll be happy to hear that Sam and...
- Wait!

22:10.452 --> 22:14.123
Whatever Dave hears,
he'll hear from me.

22:14.581 --> 22:19.169
I made a mistake last night.
I almost made a mistake.

22:19.336 --> 22:25.174
I've admitted this to Diane and now
I'm telling her that I'm finally convinced.

22:26.551 --> 22:30.805
I'm crazy about this woman.
She is the best thing going

22:30.972 --> 22:37.437
and I care about no one else. I'm not
going to let anything come between us.

22:45.235 --> 22:47.612
Puke.

22:51.116 --> 22:54.369
Find someone else
to waste your evenings with

22:54.536 --> 22:58.956
cos I'm gonna be wasting mine
with this little filly.

22:59.123 --> 23:02.084
Well, I know when I'm beat.

23:03.169 --> 23:09.633
Wait. I want you to watch me kiss my
woman here. You might learn something.

23:11.635 --> 23:14.096
That's great, Sam.

23:15.680 --> 23:19.392
- Didi said you're the best kisser.
- Really?

24:01.015 --> 24:02.016
English

24:03.305 --> 24:09.881
