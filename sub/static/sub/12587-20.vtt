<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:33.659 --> 00:36.003
Dinner is almost ready, Hank.

00:35.994 --> 00:37.462
Turkey chili.

00:37.454 --> 00:40.253
It sounded so crazy,
I just had to try it.

00:40.249 --> 00:43.093
Well, I'm just gonna make
a quick call to my mom.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.213
I haven't checked in
since yesterday.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.597
Hello?

00:47.589 --> 00:48.806
Greetings.

00:48.799 --> 00:51.643
My name is Prince Jabari.

00:51.635 --> 00:52.761
I live in Nigeria,

00:52.928 --> 00:55.056
and I need
to use your bank account

00:55.055 --> 00:56.682
for a short while.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.275
Hank? Is that you?

00:58.267 --> 01:00.816
No. It's Prince Jabari.

01:00.811 --> 01:04.566
Hank, if you need money,
I can send you a check.

01:04.565 --> 01:07.819
I just got adorable ones--
Covered bridges.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.820
Okay, Mom, it is me.

01:09.820 --> 01:12.573
I'm just trying to make sure
you're on your toes.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.825
There are people out there

01:13.824 --> 01:15.747
who would take advantage
of someone like you.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.003
You're sweet to worry, honey.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.838
Oh, I have news.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.173
I'm getting married.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.542
Really? Well, that's great.

01:23.542 --> 01:24.794
I've always liked Gary.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.339
Any man who eats that much
brisket can't be all bad.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.965
Oh, not to Gary.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.763
Gary and I broke up weeks ago.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.598
What? Why?

01:33.594 --> 01:35.471
He got paranoid, Hank.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.598
He was always snooping around.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.817
That's how he found out
about me and Chuck.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.776
What...? Who's Chuck?

01:41.768 --> 01:43.566
We met a couple of months ago.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.314
The wedding is next weekend.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.816
Hope you can make it, honey.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.987
Bye.

01:47.983 --> 01:49.951
Who's Chuck?!

01:51.320 --> 01:54.199
I don't understand
what the heck is going on here.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.040
How could my mother
be getting married?

01:56.033 --> 01:57.535
They just met.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.081
Probably got her in trouble.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.079
When you know, you know, Hank.

02:01.079 --> 02:03.127
But sometimes you're wrong.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.375
Well, I tell you what.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.593
I'm gonna give this Chuck
the once-over

02:06.585 --> 02:08.383
as soon as I get to Arizona.

02:08.377 --> 02:11.803
I wish I had someone
to look after me when I get old.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.596
Maybe I'll just get a cat.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.391
Although I hear
they eat you after you die.

02:16.386 --> 02:17.729
Lucky for you,

02:17.721 --> 02:19.769
the Japanese are
developing robots--

02:19.765 --> 02:22.564
Sexy robots
to care for the elderly.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.687
Thank God
for that tiny, perverted,

02:24.686 --> 02:26.688
technologically advanced nation.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.319
Well, we made it.

02:32.319 --> 02:36.199
A road trip west that stops
before you hit California.

02:36.198 --> 02:38.041
Pretty good in my book.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.206
111 degrees?

02:40.202 --> 02:42.796
Phoenix can't really be
that hot, can it?

02:46.583 --> 02:49.211
Oh, my God, it's like
standing on the sun!

02:49.211 --> 02:51.509
This city should not exist.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.758
It is a monument
to man's arrogance.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.722
Well, that must be Chuck's car.

02:55.717 --> 02:57.719
You can learn a lot about a guy

02:57.719 --> 02:59.721
from what he has lying
on his seat.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.064
No time, Hank.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.353
We are moments away

03:02.349 --> 03:03.771
from sunstroke
and certain death.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.936
Go, go, go!

03:07.896 --> 03:11.491
I picked up another safety bar
for your bathroom, Mom.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.826
Last time I was here,

03:12.818 --> 03:16.163
I noticed a dead spot between
the shower and the toilet.

03:16.154 --> 03:18.407
I hardly think that's necessary.

03:18.407 --> 03:21.035
Well, you're gonna be living
in this condo a long time.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.503
I want to make sure
it's as safe as possible.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.712
Sounds like

03:24.705 --> 03:26.378
pretty good advice, Tilly.

03:26.373 --> 03:27.795
I'd listen to your son.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.631
Chuck Garrison.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.301
I'm the lucky guy who tricked
your mom into marrying me.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.718
Yeah.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.639
Aw, look at you two lovebirds.

03:37.634 --> 03:40.262
Ready to start what's left
of your lives together.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.809
You must be Peggy.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.728
And that would make you Bobby.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.816
Yes, sir.

03:44.808 --> 03:46.810
Well, he's smooth, all right.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.279
Come check out
my new air ionizer.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.115
It was endorsed
by Norman Schwarzkopf.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.735
So, Chuck, what, if anything,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.533
do you do for a living, Chuck?

03:56.528 --> 03:57.825
Well, I'm retired now,

03:57.821 --> 04:00.415
but I used to own a chain
of hardware stores.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.750
Used to, huh?

04:01.908 --> 04:03.751
Sounds like
there's a story there.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.162
No story.

04:05.162 --> 04:06.789
My son runs the business now.

04:06.955 --> 04:10.755
For a kid with only one thumb,
he's doing okay for himself.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.344
Grandma,
is this you parasailing?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.882
Yes.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.597
Chuck and I went to Mexico

04:15.589 --> 04:17.716
to celebrate his 70th birthday.

04:17.716 --> 04:18.808
Parasailing?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.052
Is that the kind

04:20.051 --> 04:21.769
of daredevil stuff
you're into, Chuck?

04:21.928 --> 04:23.601
Actually, it was Tilly's idea.

04:24.806 --> 04:25.728
The kettle's ready.

04:25.891 --> 04:28.360
I thought some tea
would take the chill off.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.819
None for me.

04:29.811 --> 04:33.236
I was thinking Chuck and I
could take a little drive.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.155
You know what I miss most
about the hardware game?

04:36.151 --> 04:37.744
The nails.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.830
Galvanized,
hand-cut, roofing.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.033
We had a nail for every mood.

04:43.033 --> 04:46.663
Well, Chuck, I could spend
all day talking about nails--

04:46.661 --> 04:49.835
I have-- but I got
to ask you something.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.631
Why did you start dating my mom
when she was still with Gary?

04:53.627 --> 04:54.970
I feel terrible about that.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.508
I really do.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.507
But Tilly didn't tell me
about Gary

04:58.507 --> 05:00.555
until after they broke up.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.804
Feels like it's
cooling down a bit.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.522
Sure does.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.767
Have you ever been
indicted, Chuck?

05:09.434 --> 05:11.812
Look, Hank, I know
you just met me,

05:11.812 --> 05:13.735
but you have nothing
to worry about.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.366
I love your mom,
and I promise you,

05:16.358 --> 05:18.611
her happiness
is the most important thing

05:18.610 --> 05:19.827
in the world to me.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.831
Well, that's good to hear.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.622
You know what
my favorite nail is, Chuck?

05:25.617 --> 05:29.042
The three-penny,
fluted stainless steel.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.459
I don't know why.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.423
I don't know.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.966
If this were a Hugh Grant movie,

05:39.965 --> 05:42.593
this is the moment
when he would run in.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.061
If this were a
Julia Roberts movie,

05:45.053 --> 05:48.523
this is the moment
when she would run out.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.731
Welcome.

05:52.894 --> 05:56.068
We are here today
to witness and bless

05:56.064 --> 06:00.069
Matilda and Charles'
union of marriage.

06:00.068 --> 06:03.743
Do you give this woman
to be married to this man?

06:03.738 --> 06:05.115
I, uh...

06:05.115 --> 06:07.664
Uh, well...

06:09.119 --> 06:11.372
Uh...

06:11.371 --> 06:12.998
yes, I do.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.338
Congratulations, you two.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.770
Bye.
Bye.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.690
Ooh, they're expecting
thunderstorms in Phoenix.

06:37.689 --> 06:39.407
Hank, call your mom

06:39.399 --> 06:41.527
and remind her not
to use the phone.

06:41.526 --> 06:44.826
Well, luckily, Chuck is around
to take care of my mom now.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.791
I can stop worrying so much
and just relax.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.543
What the heck?!

06:51.828 --> 06:54.877
Mom, Dad,
there's a spaceship outside!

07:00.337 --> 07:01.759
Is that Mom?

07:01.755 --> 07:03.883
We sold our condos, Hank.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.805
We're going
to spend our golden years

07:05.800 --> 07:07.768
zigzagging across the country!

07:15.143 --> 07:16.520
Yup.

07:17.812 --> 07:18.779
Mm-hmm.

07:20.815 --> 07:22.988
Yeah.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.157
No, no, no, no, no!

07:25.153 --> 07:26.370
What's going on?

07:26.363 --> 07:27.990
You can't live in a trailer park

07:27.989 --> 07:29.832
so you bring trailer park
to you?

07:29.824 --> 07:32.748
I dislike this RV
as much as you do, Kahn,

07:32.744 --> 07:34.337
but it is my mom's.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.832
Ah, the portrait
completes itself.

07:36.831 --> 07:39.334
Granny rocking away
in the driveway

07:39.334 --> 07:42.838
tapping her toes to the fiddle
and setting a spell.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.464
Why you hate me? Why?

07:46.007 --> 07:48.806
Dang it, I never should've
trusted that Chuck.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.396
I take my eye off the ball
one time,

07:51.388 --> 07:53.516
and now my mom's living
in a house

07:53.515 --> 07:55.768
that could get T-boned
on the freeway.

07:55.767 --> 07:59.317
I've often fantasized
about the RV lifestyle.

07:59.312 --> 08:00.734
You live in a town

08:00.730 --> 08:03.074
until people grow tired
of your anecdotes.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.489
Then you pull out the chocks
and drive off.

08:05.485 --> 08:08.739
At least the condo was safe
and stationary.

08:08.738 --> 08:11.366
Who knows what kind of
terrible things can happen

08:11.366 --> 08:12.993
to her on the open road?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.745
You're right to be scared, Hank.

08:14.911 --> 08:17.835
RVs are a one-way ticket
to meth addiction

08:17.831 --> 08:21.085
and KOA sites
where the law has no meaning.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.757
Tilly is about to enter a world

08:22.919 --> 08:26.139
that she cannot change,
but will change her.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.010
Welcome to our home.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.808
Would you like the grand tour?

08:31.803 --> 08:33.225
Not so grand.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.225
This place makes my old
one-bedroom condo look

08:36.224 --> 08:37.817
like the Hearst Castle.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.436
Not here. Not now.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.736
Well, I think
it's surprisingly spacious.

08:43.732 --> 08:45.826
In fact, now that
it's fully expanded,

08:45.817 --> 08:48.320
our driveway
is completely unusable.

08:49.654 --> 08:51.281
This thing's got everything.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.000
Look-- a camera so you can see
what's behind you.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.455
Oh!

08:58.455 --> 09:00.457
Dinner's ready, everyone!

09:07.839 --> 09:10.592
Chuck, would you please
say grace?

09:10.592 --> 09:11.809
Sure thing.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.599
Thank you, God, for your bounty,

09:13.595 --> 09:15.142
which we are about to enjoy.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.641
And for protecting me
and the other motorists

09:17.640 --> 09:19.438
from my wife's erratic driving.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.778
This RV is clearly
too much car for her.

09:21.936 --> 09:23.609
We were all over the road.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.822
Amen.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.031
Message received.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.118
Potatoes, Mr. Slowpoke?

09:28.109 --> 09:30.111
I'd love some potatoes.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.079
We need an excuse to leave.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.415
Blame computers.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.784
Old people do not
understand computers.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.668
I'm a defensive driver.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.333
You should try it sometime.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.627
I like getting out
of first gear.

09:41.623 --> 09:43.591
You should try that sometime.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.551
Yup. Potatoes.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.547
This thing doesn't exactly
stop on a dime, Tilly.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.173
Wow, look at that.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.050
You're showing some emotion.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.178
I thought I'd married
a piece of driftwood.

09:54.177 --> 09:55.394
Emotion?

09:55.386 --> 09:57.809
Is that what led you
to flip off that trucker?

09:57.806 --> 09:59.808
He chased us through two mesas.

09:59.808 --> 10:02.607
So, is this a foot
or a table I'm touching?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.229
I'm kicking it right now.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.822
Foot?

10:05.814 --> 10:07.236
Table?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.234
Must be table.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.578
Chuck, it has
been two weeks.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.571
you need a prescription!

10:13.571 --> 10:16.290
Not everyone's
libido is the same!

10:16.282 --> 10:20.003
I'm thinking about getting
a mesh screen for my gutters.

10:19.994 --> 10:21.837
Where do you guys fall on that?

10:21.830 --> 10:23.252
Hank, shh, shh, shh!

10:23.248 --> 10:25.797
I can't hear the fight
over your annoying small talk.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.836
Well, now we can drive

10:27.836 --> 10:29.008
to Hearst Castle.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.630
Are you kidding?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.804
The Exxon Valdez here only
gets three feet per gallon.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.223
We'll be lucky to make it
to the nearest White Castle.

10:36.219 --> 10:37.562
This is what happens

10:37.554 --> 10:39.727
when you base a relationship
on fiery passion.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.106
I've heard.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.476
Forget it!

10:42.475 --> 10:43.818
I'm going for a walk.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.563
I was going to suggest
a flying leap!

10:47.814 --> 10:49.691
All right,
this has gone too far.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.659
I got to do something.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.781
Sorry you had to see that, Hank.

10:56.781 --> 10:57.828
Look, Chuck,

10:57.824 --> 10:59.826
I've kept my powder dry
up until now,

10:59.826 --> 11:01.828
but I gotta tell you something.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.456
I think this RV was a mistake.

11:04.455 --> 11:07.129
The perm I got in the '70s
was a mistake.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.173
This was a disaster.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.797
So, this wasn't your idea?

11:11.796 --> 11:13.423
No, it was your mother's.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.470
Personally,

11:14.465 --> 11:15.808
I prefer living in something

11:15.800 --> 11:18.474
that doesn't require me
to do a lot of quick math

11:18.469 --> 11:20.221
when I'm approaching
a low bridge.

11:20.221 --> 11:22.815
Mom never mentioned
wanting an RV.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.686
Your mom has something
of a wild streak, Hank.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.687
It's part of why I fell for her.

11:27.687 --> 11:28.734
The parasailing,

11:28.897 --> 11:31.741
midnight swims
at the condo, UGGs.

11:31.900 --> 11:35.325
I just wish Tilly and I
could get our old life back.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.288
Huh.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.248
Maybe you can.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.207
I put out some feelers
at Strickland

11:43.203 --> 11:46.047
and I think I've lined
up a buyer for the RV.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.416
It always amazes me

11:47.415 --> 11:49.964
what a well-placed flier
can accomplish.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.802
And I picked up some information

11:51.794 --> 11:53.546
about local condos for seniors.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.225
Every unit has a spa tub.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.219
Maybe that'll help
convince Tilly.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.098
Convince me of what?

12:02.096 --> 12:03.814
Well, um...

12:03.806 --> 12:05.479
we've been talking, Mom.

12:05.475 --> 12:06.818
We think it's best

12:06.809 --> 12:09.733
if you and Chuck move
into another condo.

12:09.729 --> 12:10.776
What?

12:10.772 --> 12:13.400
What about the RV?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.777
Well, you'd, uh, sell that.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.370
I can take care of everything.

12:17.362 --> 12:19.990
And you decided all of this
behind my back?

12:19.989 --> 12:22.833
I'm sure the RV seemed
like a good idea,

12:22.825 --> 12:24.452
but it's too dangerous.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.749
Absolutely.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.840
Most accidental deaths
occur either on the road

12:28.831 --> 12:30.333
or in the bathroom.

12:30.333 --> 12:31.801
Now you've combined the two.

12:31.960 --> 12:33.928
It is a recipe for disaster.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.843
And you're a part of this?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.260
I think it's for the best.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.679
Well, I don't.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.801
And I'll thank you all

12:39.801 --> 12:42.145
to keep your noses
out of my business.

12:42.136 --> 12:45.106
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to my RV.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.272
Wait, Tilly.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.270
Honey...

12:50.270 --> 12:53.820
Your pajamas and your weird
pillow will be on the lawn.

12:53.815 --> 12:56.785
It's not weird.
It's memory foam!

13:01.823 --> 13:03.825
Morning there, Chuck.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.827
Hope you don't mind.
I'm making some eggs.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.579
I haven't known your mom long,

13:07.578 --> 13:10.832
but I know she can't stay mad
when she's eating poached eggs.

13:10.832 --> 13:12.459
Toast points.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.052
You are pitching some woo,
Chuck Garrison.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.843
I feel bad about last night.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.262
I just want to put this nonsense
behind us.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.557
What the heck?

13:28.182 --> 13:29.775
She's gone.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.276
Jackass.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.791
Uh, no, officer, my mom
isn't technically a runaway,

13:44.782 --> 13:47.786
but I still think the Amber
Alert is the way to go here.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.001
Well, it's a dumb policy.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.795
The woman is crazy.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.383
She could be anywhere by now.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.797
I demand recompense!

13:55.793 --> 13:58.797
Stupid RV run over
my container herb garden.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.265
Where I get mint
for mojitos now?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.259
I don't have time for this,
Kahn.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.806
My mom's gone missing.

14:04.802 --> 14:05.803
Ah!

14:05.803 --> 14:07.020
This is exactly

14:07.013 --> 14:09.061
why I had a chip put in Nancy.

14:09.057 --> 14:10.809
I'm worried about her out there.

14:10.808 --> 14:13.812
She thinks cruise control
is like autopilot.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.064
She tried to make a cup
of coffee, Hank.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.317
I'm going to try
calling her again.

14:22.070 --> 14:23.663
I'll have a tuna melt

14:23.654 --> 14:25.406
and some strawberry rhubarb pie.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.453
Ooh!

14:26.449 --> 14:28.543
But bring the pie first.

14:28.534 --> 14:29.831
I like you.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.545
You're a hot ticket.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.541
If you're heading out to see
the wildflowers off Route 9,

14:34.540 --> 14:36.542
make sure you have
four-wheel drive.

14:36.542 --> 14:37.759
The access road is bumpy.

14:37.919 --> 14:38.920
Oh, yes.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.547
I've got four wheels.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.471
Hot ticket.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.810
Tilly talked about going

14:45.802 --> 14:48.806
to the Mark Twain Festival
in Sulphur Springs.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.807
Maybe we should head
in that direction.

14:50.807 --> 14:51.808
Good idea.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.810
I just hope we find her
before we get there.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.814
I do not want to get involved
in that traffic.

14:56.813 --> 14:58.815
Hey, dang ol',
let's get going, man.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.817
You guys don't have to come.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.160
Of course we're coming.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.824
We're the Three Amigos!

15:03.820 --> 15:04.821
And Bill.

15:04.821 --> 15:07.290
And Chuck, is it?

15:07.281 --> 15:08.828
Dad...

15:08.825 --> 15:11.123
can I help look
for Grandma, too?

15:11.119 --> 15:13.087
Tomorrow is garbage day, Bobby.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.706
I need you here.

15:27.552 --> 15:30.021
Hot dog!

15:33.099 --> 15:35.101
Maybe Tilly stopped in here.

15:35.101 --> 15:36.819
She said something
about this place

15:36.811 --> 15:38.734
having the best pies
in east Texas.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.739
Mmm, check it out.

15:40.731 --> 15:41.778
A couple of birds

15:41.774 --> 15:43.697
waiting to be plucked
from a tree.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.115
Mm-hmm,
yeah, man,

15:45.111 --> 15:47.705
talking 'bout dang ol'
low-hangin' fruit, man.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.165
This'll be fun to watch--

15:49.157 --> 15:51.831
Just like an '80s
spring break movie.

15:51.826 --> 15:53.749
Which one is going
to fall in love

15:53.744 --> 15:56.793
before they find out
she's a prostitute?

15:56.789 --> 15:58.837
Excuse me.

15:58.833 --> 16:01.382
We're looking for a woman
around 70.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.970
Probably paid with a check.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.805
Had her own teabag.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.174
I remember her.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.176
She was a real live wire.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.974
Mmm, no, wait.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.562
She was a hot ticket.

16:11.554 --> 16:13.056
The live Wire's still here.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.477
She went to check out

16:14.474 --> 16:16.772
the bluebonnets in the ravine
off Route 9.

16:16.767 --> 16:17.814
What?!

16:17.810 --> 16:19.528
She can't take an RV down there!

16:19.520 --> 16:20.567
Ugh, dang it.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.190
We gotta hurry.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.817
You like pie?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.113
I like pie.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.656
Let's go, guys.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.826
Hey, man, I'm sorry, man,
but dang ol' hit the road.

16:29.822 --> 16:30.823
Go on without us, man.

16:30.823 --> 16:31.665
What?!

16:31.657 --> 16:32.829
Sorry, Hank.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.169
You knew our attention spans
when you invited us.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.834
You invited yourselves.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.081
Who remembers?

16:38.080 --> 16:40.708
In fact, I forgot
where we were even going.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.508
...dumping
inches of rain into the east valley.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.805
Flash flood alerts for...

16:54.805 --> 16:57.809
The map shows this road
as a yellow dotted line.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.687
Dang it, RVs should stay
on the solid lines.

17:00.686 --> 17:01.812
That's nothin'.

17:01.812 --> 17:03.109
On the way to your place,

17:03.105 --> 17:06.108
she dumped the RV's septic
over a bridge.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.736
The people on the ferry
were not happy.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.830
Mom has made some questionable
decisions over the years.

17:11.821 --> 17:13.039
I tell you what.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.830
You know, she spent a summer
unwittingly spying

17:15.826 --> 17:17.828
for the Chinese.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.832
Looks like there's a storm
up in the hills.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.458
Yeah,

17:22.458 --> 17:24.836
and all that water is going
to drain through the ravine.

17:24.835 --> 17:27.463
Ah, Mom could get caught
in a flash flood.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.965
We gotta take a shortcut.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.570
Ugh, got-dang it!

18:00.454 --> 18:02.877
Okay, give her some gas
and hit the winch.

18:06.544 --> 18:08.262
Nice and steady.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.301
You got it!

18:12.800 --> 18:14.802
Ugh, we gotta find
something heavier

18:14.802 --> 18:16.645
to connect the cable to.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.807
You boys need some help?

18:19.807 --> 18:21.525
Tilly!
Mom!

18:21.517 --> 18:22.564
You're okay.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.813
What are you two doing out here?

18:24.812 --> 18:26.029
We came to save you.

18:26.022 --> 18:27.069
I'm fine.

18:27.064 --> 18:28.816
But I think a storm is coming.

18:28.816 --> 18:30.739
My knee is acting up.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.157
We need to get out of here.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.781
Chuck, hook the cable
to the back of the RV.

18:34.780 --> 18:36.828
Mom, I need you to pull us out.

18:36.824 --> 18:37.791
Okay.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.253
Go for it, Mom!

18:49.754 --> 18:52.803
Well, that was something.

18:52.798 --> 18:55.802
This is what I was
talking about, Mom.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.803
The road is a dangerous place.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.646
It's too easy
for someone like you

18:59.639 --> 19:01.107
to get into trouble out here.

19:01.098 --> 19:02.725
I wasn't in trouble.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.111
You two boys are the ones
who got yourselves stuck.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.150
I saved you.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.524
Well, uh, sure, this time.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.776
But you're going to get into
trouble out here eventually.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.741
I know you think
I'm an old lady, Hank.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.785
But I'm as sharp as I ever was.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.541
I don't worry about you
because you're old.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.535
I worry about you because...

19:21.535 --> 19:22.832
because you're an idiot.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.750
What?

19:23.746 --> 19:25.840
You make stupid decisions, Mom.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.128
You married Cotton.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.923
You started dating Chuck
before you broke up with Gary.

19:29.919 --> 19:32.968
You sent your gold
to some guy on TV.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.010
I'm sick of it.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.805
Have you always felt this way?

19:36.801 --> 19:41.227
Well, just maybe for the past
30 years or so.

19:41.222 --> 19:42.815
Huh.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.024
You know what?

19:44.016 --> 19:45.233
Maybe you're right.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.728
Maybe I am an idiot.

19:46.727 --> 19:47.819
Who cares?

19:47.812 --> 19:49.109
I do.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.699
When you make a mistake,
I have to pick up the pieces.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.238
No, you don't.

19:53.234 --> 19:55.407
I want to live
on my own terms, Hank.

19:55.403 --> 19:57.622
I want to have fun while I can.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.661
Let the pieces fall
where they may.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.250
Some things will work out well.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.289
Some won't.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.254
At least it won't be boring.

20:05.246 --> 20:06.668
Well, what's boring

20:06.664 --> 20:10.510
about living a sensible life
near emergency services?

20:12.837 --> 20:15.386
Can you try talking
some sense into her?

20:15.381 --> 20:16.974
The only thing I want, Hank,

20:16.966 --> 20:20.641
is to jump back in that RV,
if your mom'll have me.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.771
We can be at the Mark Twain
Festival by sunrise.

20:28.811 --> 20:30.813
Don't worry, Hank.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.235
I'll be okay.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.664
I'll do my best to look
after her, Hank.

20:40.656 --> 20:41.828

20:41.824 --> 20:45.078
You know, uh, Mom has made

20:56.839 --> 20:57.806
My-my truck!

20:58.799 --> 21:00.767

21:42.968 --> 21:45.892
<i>No, no, no, no, no!
Why you hate me?</i>
