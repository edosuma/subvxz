02:05.913 --> 02:08.703
<i>(horse approaches)</i>

03:20.704 --> 03:23.287
- Help us, Father, help us!
- What about some food?

03:23.371 --> 03:26.787
- Father, they're starving us!
- Are you staying, Father?

03:26.871 --> 03:28.495
<i>(man cackles)</i>

03:28.579 --> 03:30.078
This man's raving.

03:30.163 --> 03:33.412
Are you quite sure
you wish to see him on your own?

03:38.663 --> 03:41.037
<i>(heavy keys jangle)</i>

03:54.621 --> 03:57.078
A visitor for you, Baron Frankenstein.

03:58.163 --> 04:01.203
If you need any assistance,
I shall be outside.

04:09.746 --> 04:12.453
They told me you wanted to see me.

04:15.121 --> 04:19.287
Is it spiritual comfort you want,
my son? Is that it?

04:19.371 --> 04:21.662
<i>(Frankenstein)</i>
Keep your spiritual comfort

04:21.746 --> 04:23.703
for those who think they need it.

04:23.788 --> 04:27.328
I sent for you
because I could think of nobody else.

04:27.413 --> 04:29.578
People trust you.

04:29.663 --> 04:32.120
They listen to what you tell them.

04:36.788 --> 04:40.578
Now, you listen to me. And when I've
finished, you can pass it on to them.

04:40.663 --> 04:42.495
Then perhaps they'll believe me.

04:42.579 --> 04:45.787
- I have to tell you...
- <i>I'll</i> tell you. You just listen.

04:45.871 --> 04:50.078
I'm sorry. If you think my word will
carry any authority, you're mistaken.

04:50.204 --> 04:53.245
Perhaps you'd better not tell me
what you think so important.

04:53.329 --> 04:55.620
- You'll stay.
- Take your hands off me.

04:55.704 --> 04:58.787
- Tell me you'll stay.
- Do you want me to call the guard?

05:02.746 --> 05:07.370
I apologise. Please, sit down.

05:08.413 --> 05:12.287
I said I apologise.
I'll not forget myself again.

05:12.371 --> 05:14.162
As you wish.

05:17.621 --> 05:20.245
Unless I can convince you

05:20.371 --> 05:24.328
that what I'm about to tell you
is the absolute truth,

05:24.413 --> 05:26.620
then in one hour from now,
I shall be dead.

05:26.704 --> 05:29.037
- I told you...
- Then you'll understand.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.620
Perhaps you'd better start
from the beginning.

05:31.704 --> 05:33.787
<i>(chuckles)</i>

05:35.454 --> 05:38.078
Where did it all begin?

05:39.079 --> 05:43.162
I suppose it was
when I was a boy at school.

05:43.288 --> 05:45.787
I always had a brilliant intellect.

05:47.496 --> 05:50.578
That old fool who taught us
may have hoodwinked the others,

05:50.663 --> 05:52.162
but what did he know?

05:52.246 --> 05:54.787
He'd been teaching the same rubbish
for 30 years

05:54.871 --> 05:58.453
and I don't suppose he'd read
a new book for 20 of those.

05:59.204 --> 06:03.828
<i>When my mother died,</i>
<i>I inherited the Frankenstein fortune.</i>

06:03.913 --> 06:07.203
<i>This enabled me</i>
<i>to begin the life and the work</i>

06:07.288 --> 06:10.078
<i>I had always planned for myself.</i>

06:10.163 --> 06:11.662
Victor, dear boy,

06:11.746 --> 06:15.787
you are the sole remaining member
of the Frankenstein family.

06:15.871 --> 06:18.120
Now I know you will conduct yourself

06:18.204 --> 06:22.203
in a manner which would make
your poor dear mother proud of you.

06:22.288 --> 06:25.412
I shall do my best, Uncle. Thank you.

06:25.496 --> 06:27.578
Thank you all for coming.

06:27.663 --> 06:29.328
Goodbye.

06:35.038 --> 06:37.620
What was it you wished
to see me about, Aunt Sophie?

06:37.704 --> 06:40.120
It is a matter
of some delicacy, Victor. I...

06:40.204 --> 06:42.620
Was it about the allowance
my mother made you?

06:42.704 --> 06:45.745
- Oh...
- I shall continue to pay it.

06:45.829 --> 06:48.662
You're a good boy, Victor.
Your poor mother would be...

06:48.746 --> 06:51.412
- Yes, yes.
- Elizabeth, thank your cousin.

06:51.496 --> 06:53.495
<i>(Frankenstein)</i> There's really no need.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.203
Come along, Elizabeth.
Say thank you nicely.

06:56.288 --> 06:57.703
Thank you.

06:57.788 --> 07:01.287
She's a good girl.
She'll grow into a fine woman one day.

07:01.413 --> 07:04.328
- I'm sure she will.
- She'll make someone a good wife.

07:04.413 --> 07:05.745
Goodbye.

07:05.829 --> 07:07.662
Well, goodbye.

07:11.621 --> 07:12.745
Oh!

07:12.871 --> 07:16.120
- The first of the month your mother...
- I understand perfectly.

07:16.204 --> 07:18.620
- I shall do the same.
- Thank you.

07:34.871 --> 07:38.203
Good morning. Is this the home
of the Frankenstein family?

07:38.288 --> 07:40.120
It is.

07:40.204 --> 07:43.703
I'm Paul Krempe. I have an appointment
with Baron Frankenstein.

07:43.788 --> 07:47.078
You must be Victor.
I'm going to be your tutor.

07:47.204 --> 07:50.912
So I understand.
But surely it isn't settled yet.

07:50.996 --> 07:53.120
I thought that
this was just an interview

07:53.204 --> 07:56.078
to decide whether you were suitable
for the position.

07:56.163 --> 07:58.953
Well, yes, but I've had correspondence
with the Baron

07:59.038 --> 08:01.578
and he seemed satisfied
with my qualifications.

08:01.663 --> 08:02.828
That's right, he did.

08:02.913 --> 08:05.162
I expect he wanted to see
what I look like.

08:05.246 --> 08:07.495
Yes, that must have been it.

08:07.579 --> 08:09.995
Well, will you tell your father
that I'm here?

08:10.121 --> 08:12.203
My father is dead.

08:12.288 --> 08:15.912
- That's ridiculous. I had a letter...
- He's been dead for ten years.

08:15.996 --> 08:21.245
It was I who advertised for a tutor.
It was I who wrote to you.

08:21.329 --> 08:23.245
You're the Baron then, are you?

08:23.329 --> 08:25.370
And have been
since I was five years old.

08:25.454 --> 08:27.870
And you want a tutor for your son?

08:27.954 --> 08:30.953
I thought it would save
a lot of explanation by letter.

08:31.038 --> 08:33.203
A difficult thing at the best of times.

08:33.288 --> 08:36.745
I fail to see that the disclosure
of the facts can make any difference.

08:36.829 --> 08:41.162
You were to be engaged as my tutor,
subject to the Baron's approval.

08:41.246 --> 08:44.370
You will take up the position.
You will be paid as arranged.

08:44.496 --> 08:45.578
By whom?

08:46.579 --> 08:51.787
By the Baron. Well, I'm quite rich.
Now, do you still want the position?

08:51.871 --> 08:55.120
I should be honoured, Herr Baron.

08:56.913 --> 08:58.703
<i>(Paul clicks his heels)</i>

09:01.204 --> 09:04.162
<i>My first opinion of Paul</i>
<i>was soon confirmed.</i>

09:04.288 --> 09:07.037
<i>He turned out to be an admirable tutor.</i>

09:07.121 --> 09:11.745
<i>In two years I'd learned all he had</i>
<i>to teach, but we went on together</i>

09:11.829 --> 09:17.245
<i>probing into the unknown,</i>
<i>investigating, recording, searching,</i>

09:17.329 --> 09:19.578
<i>always searching,</i>

09:19.663 --> 09:22.203
<i>until, gradually,</i>
<i>the great sweep of our research</i>

09:22.288 --> 09:24.453
<i>began to assume a single direction.</i>

09:24.538 --> 09:28.537
<i>And to this aim</i>
<i>we finally turned all our energies.</i>

09:30.454 --> 09:35.370
<i>It took us years of unrelenting work</i>
<i>to discover what we were seeking.</i>

09:35.454 --> 09:38.037
<i>Then, one night,</i>

09:38.121 --> 09:41.662
<i>out of sight and sound</i>
<i>of the rest of the house,</i>

09:41.788 --> 09:44.828
<i>our efforts were rewarded.</i>

09:44.954 --> 09:46.745
<i>(bubbling)</i>

10:05.413 --> 10:09.412
<i>(low hum)</i>

10:21.538 --> 10:24.037
<i>(crackling)</i>

11:23.246 --> 11:26.120
<i>(bubbling)</i>

12:51.246 --> 12:53.578
Paul, it's alive.

12:54.871 --> 12:58.287
Paul! Paul, we've done it!

12:58.371 --> 13:00.370
<i>(both laugh)</i>

13:02.121 --> 13:04.453
Paul, we've done it!

13:06.413 --> 13:09.370
There seemed to be a lag
between the cardiac reaction

13:09.454 --> 13:13.370
and the first visible signs of life.
That'll be the time necessary

13:13.454 --> 13:18.620
for the heartbeats to circulate the
bloodstream throughout the entire body.

13:20.204 --> 13:25.828
If we could delay or prolong the period
in which the body is apparently dead

13:25.913 --> 13:28.120
while the heart is alive,

13:28.204 --> 13:31.870
we'd have a living body
with only the barest life spark present.

13:31.996 --> 13:36.120
Think what that would mean when
it came to performing major surgery.

13:36.204 --> 13:39.287
We could save hundreds of lives.

13:39.371 --> 13:41.912
Reducing shock to a minimum,
no loss of blood.

13:41.996 --> 13:45.120
Victor, the Medical Federation
meets next month in Berne.

13:45.204 --> 13:47.203
Can we have our paper ready by then?

13:47.288 --> 13:50.078
We could. But we're not going to.

13:50.163 --> 13:54.662
But why not? The Federation doesn't meet
again for a year. Why wait that long?

13:54.746 --> 13:56.287
We must wait, Paul.

13:56.371 --> 13:59.787
What we've done up to now
is nothing. Nothing to what we <i>will</i> do.

13:59.871 --> 14:02.578
We've only just started.
Just opened the door.

14:02.663 --> 14:06.870
Now is the time to go through that door
and find what lies beyond it.

14:06.954 --> 14:11.412
Don't you see, Paul? We've discovered
the source of life itself.

14:11.538 --> 14:14.287
We've have used it
to restore a creature that was dead.

14:14.371 --> 14:19.245
This is a tremendous discovery,
but we mustn't share it yet.

14:19.329 --> 14:22.578
We must move on to the next stage.

14:23.371 --> 14:27.245
We've restored life
where life was extinct.

14:28.788 --> 14:31.953
It's no longer sufficient
to bring the dead back to life.

14:32.038 --> 14:36.120
We must create from the beginning.
We must build up our own creature,

14:36.204 --> 14:37.828
and build it up from nothing.

14:38.663 --> 14:42.328
From what? What on earth
are you talking about?

14:42.413 --> 14:43.953
Forget the whole.

14:44.038 --> 14:49.953
Now we must take the parts:
limbs, organs, and then we must build.

14:50.079 --> 14:51.578
Build what?

14:52.538 --> 14:55.495
The most complex thing known to man.

14:56.246 --> 14:57.620
Man himself.

14:57.704 --> 15:01.370
We must create a human being,
a man with the perfect physique,

15:01.454 --> 15:04.578
with the hands of an artist
and the matured brain of a genius.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.620
- We can do it. Don't you see?
- No, I don't.

15:07.704 --> 15:11.662
What you're saying is nonsense,
a revolt against nature.

15:11.746 --> 15:15.037
- Such a thing could only end in evil.
- What's the matter with you?

15:15.121 --> 15:17.745
You haven't shown any scruples
up to now.

15:17.829 --> 15:21.495
As for revolting against nature,
haven't we done so and succeeded?

15:21.579 --> 15:24.703
Isn't the thing that's dead
supposed to be dead for all time?

15:24.788 --> 15:27.245
Yet we brought it back to life.

15:27.329 --> 15:32.245
We hold in the palms of our hands such
secrets that have never been dreamed of.

15:32.329 --> 15:35.328
Where nature puts up barriers
to confine the scope of man,

15:35.413 --> 15:38.745
we've broken through those barriers.
There's nothing to stop us.

15:38.829 --> 15:40.703
What is it you want to do?

15:45.038 --> 15:48.370
First we need the framework, the body.

15:48.454 --> 15:51.495
Last week they hanged a man
at Ingolstadt, a highwayman.

15:51.579 --> 15:55.370
He'd been terrifying the countryside
for months. As a warning to others,

15:55.454 --> 15:58.662
his body has been left on a gibbet
just outside the town.

15:58.788 --> 16:00.912
It'll hang there till it rots.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.078
Or till it's stolen.

16:05.163 --> 16:06.662
<i>(glasses clink)</i>

16:21.163 --> 16:22.828
Whoa!

16:45.954 --> 16:48.162
<i>(horse whinnies)</i>

17:14.329 --> 17:16.245
Whoa! Whoa!

17:34.788 --> 17:39.120
Well, the birds
didn't waste much time, did they?

17:39.204 --> 17:41.078
The eyes.

17:41.163 --> 17:43.995
Half the head's eaten away.

17:50.829 --> 17:52.828
What are you going to do?

17:52.913 --> 17:56.120
Take the head off.
It's no use to me anyway.

18:58.704 --> 19:02.203
<i>(fizzing)</i>

19:11.913 --> 19:15.787
It's in the acid.
A few minutes and there'll be no trace.

19:19.746 --> 19:23.578
Now, Paul, give me a hand
with his clothes, will you?

19:38.204 --> 19:40.162
Just look at those hands.

19:40.246 --> 19:43.328
Great clodhopping things.
No wonder he was a robber.

19:43.413 --> 19:46.537
With hands like those,
he couldn't have been anything else.

19:46.621 --> 19:49.078
Except perhaps a gorilla.

19:49.163 --> 19:51.995
I don't think
we should continue with this.

19:52.121 --> 19:55.037
We should wait and present our findings
at the Federation.

19:55.121 --> 19:58.412
- Should anything go wrong with that...
- I've got it.

19:58.496 --> 20:01.078
- What?
- You look after things while I'm gone.

20:01.163 --> 20:02.203
Gone where?

20:02.288 --> 20:05.370
If I leave tonight
I should get back by tomorrow evening.

20:05.454 --> 20:08.203
- Victor!
- Yes, Paul, what is it?

20:08.288 --> 20:10.953
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

20:11.038 --> 20:15.328
Going? I'm going away for a while.
I'll tell you about it when I get back.

20:15.413 --> 20:18.412
And, Paul, better not touch our friend
while I'm gone.

20:18.496 --> 20:21.453
Let him rest in peace...
while he can.

20:21.538 --> 20:23.662
Let's have some food. I'm hungry.

20:40.996 --> 20:42.995
I thought it was the master.

20:43.079 --> 20:45.078
No, he hasn't come back yet, Justine.

20:45.163 --> 20:47.912
Will he be in time for dinner, sir?

20:47.996 --> 20:50.037
I don't know, he didn't say.

20:51.121 --> 20:52.620
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

20:52.704 --> 20:54.870
There he is now, sir.

21:00.579 --> 21:04.162
<i>(woman)</i> Good evening,
Baron Frankenstein is expecting me.

21:04.246 --> 21:05.912
May I come in?

21:07.079 --> 21:09.703
I shall need some assistance
with my luggage.

21:09.788 --> 21:12.745
- Luggage?
- Yes, I'm coming to stay.

21:12.829 --> 21:16.120
Well, I'm sorry, miss,
but the Baron told no one of this.

21:16.204 --> 21:20.745
But he must have done.
I wrote to him some weeks ago.

21:20.829 --> 21:23.245
Victor, how happy I am to see you.

21:23.329 --> 21:25.120
I'm afraid there's some mistake.

21:25.204 --> 21:29.037
Mistake? But didn't you get my letter?

21:29.121 --> 21:32.453
I'm not Victor. I'm Paul Krempe.

21:32.538 --> 21:36.703
Oh, Paul Krempe. I'm so sorry.

21:36.788 --> 21:39.703
It's just that, well,
I haven't seen Victor for so long.

21:39.788 --> 21:43.245
Now that you know who <i>I</i> am,
why not tell me who <i>you</i> are?

21:43.329 --> 21:46.662
I'm Elizabeth, Victor's cousin.
Didn't he tell you about me?

21:46.746 --> 21:51.078
No, he did not, for which he will be
severely reprimanded when he returns.

21:51.163 --> 21:52.453
Oh, he's away?

21:52.538 --> 21:54.745
Yes, but he's expected back any moment.

21:54.829 --> 21:57.745
So we shan't have long to wait.

21:57.829 --> 22:00.078
Are you going to stay with us long?

22:00.204 --> 22:03.787
I'm coming to live here.
This is to be my home.

22:03.871 --> 22:05.995
- Live here?
<i>- (Frankenstein).</i> Paul, I...

22:08.621 --> 22:10.245
Elizabeth.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.370
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Victor.

22:12.454 --> 22:14.620
Well, Elizabeth.

22:15.538 --> 22:18.953
I received your letter. I was
so sorry to hear about your mother.

22:19.038 --> 22:21.620
How are you?
The maid will show you to your room.

22:21.704 --> 22:25.370
Paul, come and see what I've got.
Elizabeth, we'll see you at dinner.

22:25.454 --> 22:27.828
- Yes, but...
- Paul, come on.

22:27.913 --> 22:30.287
As he said, we will see you at dinner.

22:35.371 --> 22:36.828
<i>(sighs)</i>

22:42.788 --> 22:45.578
Lock the door, Paul.
Come and look at these.

22:57.788 --> 23:01.078
<i>(sighs deeply)</i> What about these?

23:01.163 --> 23:04.203
Have you ever seen anything
so beautiful?

23:04.288 --> 23:08.620
Bardello's hands. The hands
of the world's greatest sculptor.

23:08.704 --> 23:10.787
- Where did you get them?
- Leipzig.

23:10.871 --> 23:13.287
I heard that Bardello died there
last week.

23:13.371 --> 23:16.953
- All it needed was a little bribery.
- You realise what this means?

23:17.038 --> 23:18.995
It means that our friend will be reborn

23:19.079 --> 23:21.578
with the finest hands
ever possessed by any man.

23:21.663 --> 23:26.495
I mean your cousin's arrival. We can't
continue with this experiment. Not here.

23:26.579 --> 23:30.662
- What are you talking about?
- Elizabeth. She might find out.

23:30.746 --> 23:33.328
What if she does? Where's the harm?

23:33.413 --> 23:35.537
She's young, Victor.

23:35.621 --> 23:38.703
Her mind would be incapable
of receiving such a shock.

23:38.788 --> 23:42.370
Alright. You can't see the horror
of what you're doing.

23:42.454 --> 23:45.037
At first I was blind to it.

23:46.079 --> 23:47.870
And now?

23:47.954 --> 23:51.912
When you were away, I decided I could
not continue with this experiment.

23:51.996 --> 23:55.328
I hope I can convince you I'm right,
change your mind, too.

23:55.413 --> 23:59.328
You'll never do that, Paul. In six
months' time, you'll rejoice in the fact

23:59.413 --> 24:02.370
that you helped me present
this achievement to the world.

24:02.454 --> 24:05.328
- You'll be as famous as I will be.
- No, Victor. Infamous!

24:05.413 --> 24:07.745
I will not help you, not any more.

24:07.829 --> 24:09.578
I beseech you, give this thing up,

24:09.663 --> 24:12.162
if not for your own sake,
for the sake of the girl.

24:12.246 --> 24:15.703
You're wasting your time, Paul.
Help me graft these hands on.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.870
It'll be interesting
to see if they take.

24:17.954 --> 24:21.787
Can't you understand?
I will not help you any more.

24:21.913 --> 24:24.287
And I shall try and make Elizabeth
leave here.

24:25.496 --> 24:28.120
Elizabeth won't leave, Paul.

24:29.371 --> 24:33.078
If you're really not going to help me,
I'd be glad if you'd leave me alone.

24:33.163 --> 24:35.620
I have work to do.

24:37.788 --> 24:42.828
I shan't be down to dinner.
Make my excuses to Elizabeth, will you?

24:58.746 --> 25:02.162
- Will you require anything else?
- No, thank you, that'll be all.

25:02.246 --> 25:06.037
Very well, sir.
I shall take the master's dinner up now.

25:06.121 --> 25:07.703
Leave it outside the door.

25:07.788 --> 25:10.828
Of course, Herr Krempe, I always do.

25:11.996 --> 25:15.078
Do you take your coffee
black or white, Paul?

25:15.163 --> 25:19.328
Elizabeth, I don't know you very well
but I want you to do something for me.

25:19.413 --> 25:20.912
Yes?

25:20.996 --> 25:24.412
- Leave here.
- Leave?

25:24.496 --> 25:27.537
Yes, leave this house at once
and never come back.

25:27.621 --> 25:31.245
But that's impossible.
Why do you ask it?

25:31.329 --> 25:35.578
I can't explain
but it... it will not be safe here.

25:35.663 --> 25:37.453
Not safe?

25:38.413 --> 25:41.828
- Victor will be here, won't he?
- Oh, yes. Victor will be here.

25:41.913 --> 25:43.203
Then I fail to see...

25:43.288 --> 25:45.745
It is because of Victor
I'm asking you to leave.

25:45.829 --> 25:48.912
He's conducting experiments
which could be dangerous.

25:48.996 --> 25:50.870
What sort of experiments?

25:52.954 --> 25:57.078
- You wouldn't understand.
- I would understand, I'm sure I would.

25:57.163 --> 25:58.912
Please tell me.

25:58.996 --> 26:02.953
Believe me, I can't tell you.
I would if I could.

26:03.038 --> 26:04.870
Then I shall have to ask Victor.

26:04.996 --> 26:07.203
If I'm to marry him,
I have a right to know.

26:07.288 --> 26:08.328
Marry?

26:09.371 --> 26:11.828
Of course, we're engaged.
Didn't he tell you?

26:12.829 --> 26:15.620
How can you be engaged
to someone you don't even know?

26:16.538 --> 26:19.120
It was an arrangement
between Victor and my mother.

26:19.204 --> 26:23.953
That's absurd. You can't be expected
to honour an arrangement of that sort.

26:24.038 --> 26:27.078
My mother and I
were entirely dependent upon Victor.

26:27.163 --> 26:29.537
We'd have starved without him.

26:29.621 --> 26:31.787
Now perhaps you understand.

26:31.871 --> 26:34.995
I understand you're confusing
gratitude with affection.

26:35.079 --> 26:38.537
You have no right to speak to me
like that. How dare you?

26:39.871 --> 26:44.078
I'm sorry. It's entirely your own affair
and nothing to do with me.

26:44.163 --> 26:47.953
Nevertheless, I think you should leave.
Believe me, it's for your own good.

26:48.038 --> 26:51.078
Really, I can't imagine
why you make this idiotic request.

26:51.163 --> 26:55.745
It is not a request.
It's a demand. You must not stay here.

26:55.829 --> 27:00.203
Perhaps we should let Victor
decide that. After all, it is his house.

27:00.288 --> 27:02.537
Or had you forgotten?

27:02.621 --> 27:05.537
No, I haven't forgotten.

27:05.621 --> 27:11.370
I'm sorry. Perhaps I shouldn't have
spoken to you like this.

27:11.454 --> 27:16.953
I'm sorry, too. I lost my temper.
Please forgive me.

27:17.038 --> 27:21.495
But really, Paul, just because
it was arranged years ago,

27:21.579 --> 27:25.162
that's no reason
for my <i>not</i> marrying Victor.

27:25.246 --> 27:29.703
It has always been
my dearest wish. His, too.

27:42.871 --> 27:44.787
- Victor.
- How many times must I...?

27:44.871 --> 27:48.453
- Baron then. Herr Baron.
- That's better.

27:48.538 --> 27:50.787
How much longer is this to go on?

27:50.871 --> 27:56.120
Meeting like this in dark corridors,
making love in secret.

27:56.204 --> 27:57.953
When are you going to marry me?

27:59.079 --> 28:01.287
What makes you so sure
that I'll marry you?

28:01.371 --> 28:06.537
Because you promised.
And because of this.

28:19.954 --> 28:23.162
Herr Baron Victor,

28:23.246 --> 28:26.745
this woman, what is she doing here?

28:28.038 --> 28:31.162
- Are you jealous?
- No.

28:32.371 --> 28:34.120
Yes.

28:34.204 --> 28:36.578
Yes, I <i>am</i> jealous.

28:37.329 --> 28:38.745
She's not your mistress?

28:38.829 --> 28:40.828
<i>- (laughs)</i>
- If I thought she was...

28:40.913 --> 28:44.037
On the contrary, Justine,
she's to be <i>your</i> mistress.

28:44.121 --> 28:47.245
It'll be your duty
to serve my cousin Elizabeth

28:47.329 --> 28:51.953
and see to her every need
just as thoroughly as you have mine.

28:52.038 --> 28:56.120
- But in a different way, of course.
- Of course.

29:02.454 --> 29:05.287
Victor, you're not going away again,
are you?

29:05.371 --> 29:08.912
I'm afraid I must.
But I'll be back tomorrow evening.

29:08.996 --> 29:12.870
Why, Elizabeth, what's the matter?

29:12.954 --> 29:16.995
It's just that I'm disappointed.
I see so little of you these days.

29:17.079 --> 29:20.578
There are the household accounts to see.
You should check them with me.

29:20.663 --> 29:24.370
They'll soon be your department.
I'm sure you'll handle them admirably.

29:24.454 --> 29:27.203
But I'd like you to see them.
I'd like your assistance.

29:27.288 --> 29:30.328
You'll be asking soon
if you can help me with my experiments.

29:30.413 --> 29:33.745
But I would. I would like that
more than anything in the world.

29:35.538 --> 29:38.745
Who knows, my dear? Perhaps you will.

29:39.788 --> 29:41.662
One day.

29:42.163 --> 29:45.078
And now I have to go.
I have some materials to buy.

29:45.163 --> 29:46.953
Materials for my work.

30:11.746 --> 30:13.703
<i>- (man coughs)</i>
<i>- (Frankenstein)</i> Well?

30:13.788 --> 30:16.870
- <i>(man</i> Here you are, sir.
- Careful, man.

30:18.621 --> 30:21.828
<i>(man)</i> Not often
we get 'em perfect in here, sir.

30:21.913 --> 30:24.370
<i>(coughs)</i>

30:24.454 --> 30:27.162
Eyes is generally the first to go.

30:34.121 --> 30:36.162
What do you think, sir?

30:36.246 --> 30:37.995
<i>(Frankenstein)</i> They'll do.

30:39.079 --> 30:42.495
<i>(man coughs)</i>

30:42.954 --> 30:45.037
<i>(Frankenstein)</i> Ten we said, didn't we?

30:45.163 --> 30:47.620
- <i>(man)</i> Each.
- The pair.

30:47.704 --> 30:50.703
<i>(man)</i> The pair. Just like you said.

31:01.954 --> 31:03.620
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

31:03.704 --> 31:05.995
- Who is it?
- Paul.

31:07.079 --> 31:08.953
I'm just coming.

31:21.579 --> 31:23.495
Come in, Paul.

31:29.329 --> 31:30.828
You wanted to see me?

31:30.954 --> 31:34.245
It's been a long time
since you've been up here. Why is that?

31:34.329 --> 31:38.162
- You know you're always welcome.
- I told you I would not help you.

31:38.288 --> 31:40.745
In that case
why do you continue to live here?

31:40.829 --> 31:44.037
But of course, it's Elizabeth
you're worrying about, isn't it?

31:44.121 --> 31:45.662
What is it you want?

31:46.829 --> 31:49.828
Haven't you found it difficult
keeping away,

31:49.913 --> 31:52.078
just guessing what I was doing?

31:52.163 --> 31:55.370
Never knowing just how well
I was getting on?

31:55.454 --> 31:58.120
Well, I've decided
to let you see my progress.

31:58.204 --> 32:01.578
Then you can judge for yourself
whether I shall succeed or not.

32:01.663 --> 32:03.870
I'm at the last stage but one.
Come and see.

32:11.204 --> 32:14.287
- Well, what do you think of it?
- It's horrible!

32:14.371 --> 32:17.245
Paul, the features are not important.

32:17.329 --> 32:20.662
What matters is I'm creating a being
that will live and breathe!

32:20.746 --> 32:23.453
Once the scars on the face heal,
it won't look so bad.

32:23.538 --> 32:25.662
Victor, I appeal to you.

32:25.746 --> 32:28.787
Stop what you're doing
before it's too late.

32:28.871 --> 32:31.870
But what <i>am</i> I doing?
I'm harming nobody.

32:31.954 --> 32:35.245
Just robbing a few graves.
What doctor or scientist doesn't?

32:35.329 --> 32:38.495
How else are we to learn
the complexities of the human animal?

32:38.579 --> 32:41.453
Doctors rob
for the eventual good of mankind.

32:41.538 --> 32:44.953
This can... This can never end
in anything but evil.

32:45.038 --> 32:47.662
Now, why do you say that?

32:47.746 --> 32:51.787
I admit he isn't a particularly
good-looking specimen at present.

32:51.871 --> 32:56.870
One's facial character is built up
by what lies behind it, in the brain.

32:56.954 --> 33:00.662
A benevolent mind, and the face
assumes the patterns of benevolence.

33:00.746 --> 33:03.162
An evil mind, then an evil face.

33:03.246 --> 33:06.537
For this, the brain of a genius
will be used.

33:06.621 --> 33:09.537
And when that brain starts to function
within the frame,

33:09.621 --> 33:14.412
then the face and features
will assume wisdom and understanding.

33:17.913 --> 33:22.078
I told you I was at the last stage
but one, the brain.

33:22.163 --> 33:24.787
A brain of superior intellect.

33:24.871 --> 33:28.495
A lifetime of knowledge
already behind it.

33:28.579 --> 33:30.537
Imagine that, Paul.

33:30.621 --> 33:33.995
My creature will be born
with a lifetime of knowledge.

33:34.079 --> 33:37.412
Victor, where is this brain
to come from?

33:42.496 --> 33:44.287
I'll get it.

33:50.246 --> 33:52.537
<i>(laughter)</i>

33:52.663 --> 33:55.453
- Now, Professor.
- Dear, oh dear!

33:55.538 --> 33:58.370
Your hospitality is too generous,
my dear Baron.

33:58.454 --> 34:02.078
On the contrary, Professor Bernstein,
it is we who are in your debt.

34:02.163 --> 34:05.495
When Victor told me you accepted
our invitation, I was overjoyed.

34:05.579 --> 34:07.870
<i>(Bernstein)</i>
You honour me, Miss Elizabeth.

34:07.954 --> 34:10.537
Not only overjoyed
because you were to stay with us

34:10.621 --> 34:14.412
but because your presence at dinner
would ensure my Victor's presence.

34:14.538 --> 34:17.620
Elizabeth thinks I spend too much time
in my laboratory.

34:17.704 --> 34:20.578
He's locked in his old laboratory
for hours on end.

34:20.663 --> 34:22.828
He doesn't eat and he doesn't sleep.

34:22.913 --> 34:26.912
I, for one, think the world would be
a far better place without research.

34:27.038 --> 34:29.078
At least, <i>my</i> world would be.

34:30.038 --> 34:32.745
She may be right, Baron.

34:33.246 --> 34:37.537
One can spend too much of one's life
locked in stuffy rooms,

34:37.621 --> 34:40.787
seeking out obscure truths.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.828
Searching, researching,

34:43.913 --> 34:47.453
until one is too old to enjoy life.

34:47.538 --> 34:50.120
You see, Victor?
The professor's on my side.

34:50.871 --> 34:52.662
You've failed me, Professor.

34:52.746 --> 34:56.453
Now Elizabeth will quote you
every time she wants me to leave my work

34:56.538 --> 34:59.328
- and idle away the time with her.
- Indeed you shall.

34:59.413 --> 35:02.287
I shall say, "Victor,
you are only a little scientist."

35:02.413 --> 35:03.787
"I shall not listen to you."

35:03.871 --> 35:06.453
"On the authority
of the greatest brain in Europe,

35:06.579 --> 35:08.537
you must leave your stuffy laboratory

35:08.663 --> 35:10.953
and come out into the sunshine
with me."

35:11.038 --> 35:13.037
Women, Professor, you see?

35:13.121 --> 35:16.828
How cleverly they twist our words
to suit their own ends.

35:18.329 --> 35:21.912
She'll only be happy
if I give up my work entirely.

35:21.996 --> 35:27.078
Is the world ready for the revelation
you scientists make?

35:27.163 --> 35:32.037
There's a great difference
between knowing that a thing is so

35:32.121 --> 35:36.870
and knowing how to use that knowledge
for the good of mankind.

35:36.954 --> 35:44.828
The trouble with us scientists
is we quickly tire of our discoveries.

35:44.913 --> 35:50.078
We hand them over to people
who are not ready for them,

35:50.163 --> 35:53.995
while we go off again
into the darkness of ignorance,

35:54.079 --> 35:57.703
searching for other discoveries

35:57.788 --> 36:03.495
which will be mishandled in
just the same way when the time comes.

36:03.579 --> 36:07.620
It's not as bad as that, surely?
Would you have us give up research, too?

36:07.704 --> 36:09.287
Good evening.

36:09.371 --> 36:13.870
Paul, I'm so glad you arrived in time
to meet Professor Bernstein.

36:13.954 --> 36:16.537
- Professor Bernstein?
- Yes, indeed.

36:16.621 --> 36:18.828
May I introduce my friend Paul Krempe.

36:18.913 --> 36:21.037
- Good evening, sir.
- How do you do, sir?

36:21.121 --> 36:23.537
The professor
is staying with us tonight.

36:23.663 --> 36:25.870
I am indeed proud to meet you, sir.

36:25.954 --> 36:28.370
I had no idea such an honour
awaited my return.

36:28.454 --> 36:31.703
We didn't expect you back
until the morning, Paul.

36:31.788 --> 36:33.578
I thought it best to come back.

36:33.663 --> 36:38.870
I've heard a great deal about you
from Baron Frankenstein.

36:38.954 --> 36:42.620
And I look forward to a talk with you
in the morning.

36:42.704 --> 36:44.245
I shall be delighted, sir.

36:44.329 --> 36:48.037
- I feel we've exhausted the professor.
- No, no, no, no, no.

36:48.121 --> 36:52.537
I have enjoyed every minute
of this delightful evening.

36:52.621 --> 36:58.162
But old age comes not alone.
Goodnight, young lady.

36:58.246 --> 37:00.995
Goodnight, Professor.
I trust that you will sleep well.

37:01.121 --> 37:02.870
- Goodnight, sir.
- Goodnight, sir.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.328
- I'll show you to your room.
- Thank you.

37:14.996 --> 37:17.912
I really am most honoured
to have you here, sir.

37:17.996 --> 37:24.328
I am most grateful to you, my boy.
You know, I'm alone in the world.

37:24.413 --> 37:27.703
And to be a guest in someone's home,

37:27.788 --> 37:33.870
especially such a charming home like
this with such a wonderful atmosphere,

37:33.954 --> 37:35.370
it's very precious to me.

37:35.496 --> 37:37.662
You are too kind, sir.

37:39.579 --> 37:42.537
I would like to show you a painting
just before you retire.

37:42.621 --> 37:45.120
It's this one
at the top of the staircase here.

37:45.204 --> 37:47.120
It was purchased by my father

37:47.204 --> 37:49.912
and illustrates
one of the early operations.

37:52.996 --> 37:57.370
If you step back a little,
you'll see it better.

37:58.121 --> 37:59.745
Look out, Professor! Look out!

38:11.829 --> 38:16.370
<i>(bell tolls)</i>

38:30.538 --> 38:32.203
Baron Frankenstein.

38:33.996 --> 38:36.995
I'm sure I'm expressing the feelings
of all of us

38:37.079 --> 38:41.203
when I say how much we appreciate
your kindness and consideration

38:41.288 --> 38:43.578
in allowing the body
of our poor colleague

38:43.663 --> 38:47.287
to find its last resting place
in your family vault.

38:47.413 --> 38:51.078
As you know, Professor Bernstein
had no living relatives.

38:51.163 --> 38:55.620
It was the least I could do.
He was a guest in my house.

39:13.496 --> 39:15.745
<i>(hammering)</i>

40:35.704 --> 40:38.162
<i>(approaching footsteps)</i>

40:43.329 --> 40:46.412
<i>- (sighs deeply)</i>
- I thought I'd find you here.

40:46.496 --> 40:50.828
That was very intelligent of you. Now
that you've found me, what do you want?

40:50.913 --> 40:55.245
You killed the old man, didn't you?
And now you're mutilating his body.

40:55.329 --> 40:59.370
Mutilating? I've removed his brain.
Mutilating has nothing to do with it.

40:59.454 --> 41:04.078
I can't prove you murdered him
but I can stop you using his brain.

41:04.163 --> 41:06.078
Why? He has no further use for it.

41:06.163 --> 41:08.745
- Give me that!
- Don't be a fool. Be careful!

41:08.829 --> 41:10.870
- You'll damage it!
<i>- (glass shatters)</i>

41:12.038 --> 41:16.662
Get out! Get away from here
and leave me alone! Get out of here!

41:17.663 --> 41:19.453
If you've damaged it...

41:19.538 --> 41:21.828
If you've damaged it...!

41:35.496 --> 41:37.370
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

41:37.454 --> 41:38.495
Who is it?

41:40.954 --> 41:42.203
What's the matter, Paul?

41:44.538 --> 41:46.995
I've come to appeal to you
to leave here.

41:47.079 --> 41:49.870
- What are you talking about? Leave?
- Now.

41:49.954 --> 41:52.203
This very minute. Before it's too late.

41:52.288 --> 41:54.912
Paul, we've been through
all this before.

41:54.996 --> 41:57.120
Won't you understand
you're in real danger?

41:57.204 --> 41:59.953
What Victor is doing
is dangerous to everyone in the house.

42:00.079 --> 42:03.578
Then why do you stay here?
You're not helping him any longer.

42:03.663 --> 42:06.120
I'll tell you why I stay here.

42:06.204 --> 42:09.495
I will not leave you alone in this house
with him.

42:09.579 --> 42:12.620
Believe me, Paul.
You're wrong about Victor.

42:12.704 --> 42:14.287
Am I?

42:14.371 --> 42:17.578
- You must be.
- How do you know?

42:17.663 --> 42:22.203
Have you ever been
in that laboratory of his? No.

42:22.288 --> 42:26.412
You cannot possibly conceive
the dreadful thing he's proposing to do.

42:26.496 --> 42:30.870
What are you trying to tell me, Paul?
That Victor is wicked, insane?

42:33.663 --> 42:37.203
Neither wicked nor insane.
Just so dedicated to his work

42:37.288 --> 42:40.537
that he can't see the terrible
consequences that could result.

42:42.454 --> 42:46.162
Elizabeth, I can't bear the thought
of any harm to you.

42:47.704 --> 42:50.203
I'd do anything
to avoid hurt to you both,

42:50.288 --> 42:53.453
but Victor is so wrapped up
in his experiments that...

42:53.538 --> 42:56.203
Stop it, Paul, please. <i>(sobs)</i>

42:56.329 --> 42:58.953
Please leave me, Paul.

47:09.496 --> 47:12.162
I want you to help me.

47:12.246 --> 47:13.578
You must be mad.

47:17.496 --> 47:21.287
That apparatus was constructed
for dual operation. You know that.

47:21.371 --> 47:24.370
I thought I could work it myself
but... but I can't.

47:26.204 --> 47:28.287
I'm delighted.

47:29.704 --> 47:32.120
That means your experiment
will not succeed.

47:34.288 --> 47:38.120
You're going to help me, Paul,
whatever you say.

47:50.954 --> 47:53.787

48:31.579 --> 48:33.495

48:45.288 --> 48:48.120
If you help me, I promise
once I've proved my theories,

48:48.204 --> 48:49.912
I'll dispose of this creature.

48:49.996 --> 48:53.537
- How long will that take?
- A month, two at the outside.

48:53.621 --> 48:57.412
And have that thing alive up there
all the time? No, Victor.

48:57.496 --> 49:00.370
If you don't help me, Paul,
then I make no such promise.

49:00.454 --> 49:04.703
Somehow I'll manage on my own.
However difficult, I'll do it.

49:04.788 --> 49:08.745
When I have succeeded, I'll introduce
Elizabeth to the world of science.

49:08.829 --> 49:09.912
You'd never dare!

49:09.996 --> 49:14.078
There is nothing more important to me
than the success of this experiment.

49:14.163 --> 49:17.120
It's what I've worked for all my life.

49:19.913 --> 49:21.537
Alright, Victor.

49:23.163 --> 49:25.203
I'll help you.

49:33.538 --> 49:35.370
<i>(glass shatters)</i>

50:06.788 --> 50:08.620
<i>(gasps for breath)</i>

50:16.038 --> 50:17.453

50:32.579 --> 50:34.245
Victor!

50:36.288 --> 50:37.995
<i>(gasps)</i>

50:40.704 --> 50:42.412
I did it, Paul.

50:44.163 --> 50:47.495
<i>(Paul)</i> This thing must be destroyed
before it regains consciousness.

50:47.579 --> 50:49.703
Do you hear me, Victor?

50:49.788 --> 50:53.245
- What did you say?
- You must destroy this thing now.

50:53.371 --> 50:55.537
Paul, don't you see? I've succeeded!

50:55.621 --> 50:58.412
Yes, nearly succeeded
in getting yourself killed.

50:58.538 --> 51:01.203
- Another ten seconds...
- This is my creation.

51:01.288 --> 51:04.495
Yes, a criminal lunatic!
It tried to kill you.

51:04.579 --> 51:07.703
That's the brain.
When you attacked me, it was damaged.

51:07.788 --> 51:09.620
That makes it your fault, Paul.

51:09.704 --> 51:12.120
Your fault it's not what
I intended it to be.

51:12.204 --> 51:13.703
But I can repair the brain.

51:13.788 --> 51:17.828
It's what I've done that counts.
I've created a being.

51:17.913 --> 51:22.037
- You promised to destroy it, Victor.
- When I've carried out my research.

51:22.121 --> 51:24.328
Don't you see you've created a monster?

51:24.413 --> 51:25.745
That doesn't matter.

51:25.829 --> 51:28.912
I shall operate on the brain tomorrow.
It shouldn't take long.

51:28.996 --> 51:32.537
Very well, Victor. Goodbye.

51:59.246 --> 52:01.828
<i>(Frankenstein)</i> Paul! Paul!

52:02.788 --> 52:05.037
- Paul, he's gone.
- He's what?

52:05.163 --> 52:08.037
I've searched the house.
Heaven knows where he's got to.

52:08.121 --> 52:10.620
It's true, Paul.
We must get out and find him!

52:10.704 --> 52:13.412
- I'll go to the village for help.
- No, I'll send word.

52:13.538 --> 52:15.828
We must pick up his trail
before he gets too far.

52:15.913 --> 52:18.287
If he gets deep into the woods
we'll never find him.

52:18.371 --> 52:20.412
I'll meet you downstairs.

52:38.829 --> 52:41.703
<i>(birds twitter)</i>

52:44.371 --> 52:46.620
<i>(footsteps)</i>

53:00.871 --> 53:04.537
Hold on, boy. You're going too fast
for your old grandpa.

53:04.621 --> 53:06.495
You sit here then, Grandpa.

53:06.621 --> 53:08.620
- Where?
- Here.

53:13.079 --> 53:15.703
I'll go on now. It's not far.

53:15.788 --> 53:17.995
Aye, thank you, boy.

53:18.121 --> 53:21.037
- Do be careful now. Go on.
- Yes, Grandpa.

53:48.913 --> 53:51.495
<i>(footsteps)</i>

53:51.579 --> 53:54.953
That was quick.
You can't have picked many.

53:59.079 --> 54:03.745
What's the matter?
Can't you find your way? I'm here, son.

54:08.538 --> 54:12.370
I've lost my stick.
Help me find it, son.

54:18.496 --> 54:21.537
You're quiet. Cat got your tongue?

54:33.204 --> 54:35.328
Who are you?

54:35.413 --> 54:37.162
Tell me who you are.

54:38.663 --> 54:42.370
What do you want with me?
Can't you see I'm only a poor blind man?

54:43.329 --> 54:45.120
I've got nothing for you.

54:46.329 --> 54:48.120
I can't harm you.

55:02.038 --> 55:05.453
Somebody help me. Help me!

<i>(screams)</i>

55:34.038 --> 55:35.203
Grandpa!

Grandpa!

56:03.621 --> 56:06.953
Look, he must have stopped here.

56:07.996 --> 56:10.662
Where did you tell
the villagers to make for?

56:10.746 --> 56:15.537
The south lakeshore. I said we'd meet
in half an hour or when we spotted him.

56:15.621 --> 56:18.578
Well, his trail
is easy to follow anyway.

56:43.163 --> 56:44.203
No, Paul!

57:00.663 --> 57:03.162
<i>(gasps)</i>

57:23.996 --> 57:25.037
You shoot well.

57:25.121 --> 57:27.453
I've done what had to be done.

57:27.538 --> 57:29.745
We'll bury him
before the villagers arrive.

57:29.829 --> 57:32.912
They won't arrive.
I didn't send the message.

57:33.371 --> 57:38.537
You madman!
You risked just two of us against that?

57:38.621 --> 57:41.787
- We might've been killed.
- We might. But we weren't.

57:43.038 --> 57:45.453
Now he's dead so it doesn't matter.

58:01.746 --> 58:03.995
Well, it's done
and I hope you're satisfied.

58:04.079 --> 58:06.995
I'm satisfied we were in time
to stop this monstrous act

58:07.079 --> 58:10.662
before it was too late,
if that's what you mean.

58:10.788 --> 58:14.995
I don't think I shall ever forgive you
for what you've done. Ever.

58:27.746 --> 58:29.870
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

58:29.954 --> 58:33.078

- It's me, Paul.

58:34.954 --> 58:36.787
Just a minute.

58:48.079 --> 58:50.203
Well?

58:50.329 --> 58:54.537
I'm leaving now. I shall send
for my things in a few days.

58:54.621 --> 58:58.537
As you wish, Paul. Where are you going?
What are you going to do?

58:58.663 --> 58:59.912
I have no idea.

58:59.996 --> 59:03.495
It's sufficient that it's no longer
necessary for me to remain here.

59:03.579 --> 59:05.453
What do you mean, necessary?

59:05.538 --> 59:09.203
Of course, there's Elizabeth.
You stayed to protect her.

59:09.288 --> 59:13.287
You've done what you set out to do.
You can leave with a clear conscience.

59:59.788 --> 1:00:01.953
I'll give you life again.

1:00:12.454 --> 1:00:15.037
- Justine, you can serve dinner now.
- Just a minute.

1:00:16.538 --> 1:00:18.120
Is it true?

1:00:24.496 --> 1:00:25.828
I beg your pardon?

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:29.162
About you marrying that... that woman?

1:00:29.288 --> 1:00:32.745
- Aren't you forgetting yourself?
- You promised to marry me.

1:00:32.829 --> 1:00:35.162
I'm not forgetting that.

1:00:35.246 --> 1:00:38.453
Yes, so I did. <i>(chuckles)</i>

1:00:38.538 --> 1:00:41.078

<i>- (chuckles)</i>

1:00:41.163 --> 1:00:44.578
- Stop it! Stop it or I'll...
- What?

1:00:44.663 --> 1:00:46.703
- What will you do?
- I'll kill you.

1:00:46.788 --> 1:00:50.370
You stupid little fool!
Did you really think I'd marry you?

1:00:50.454 --> 1:00:54.203
- You're hurting!
- Get back to your work!

1:00:54.329 --> 1:00:57.828
But you've got to marry me.
You've got to.

1:00:57.913 --> 1:00:59.620
I'm going to have a child.

1:01:01.913 --> 1:01:02.953
Since when is this?

1:01:04.038 --> 1:01:07.287
It doesn't matter.
It's true, that's all.

1:01:08.746 --> 1:01:12.412
Why choose me as the father?
Pick any man in the village.

1:01:12.496 --> 1:01:15.953
The chances are it'll be the right one.

1:01:16.038 --> 1:01:19.912
She won't think so. Not when I tell her.

1:01:19.996 --> 1:01:22.828
And I'll tell her
what you're doing in that laboratory.

1:01:22.913 --> 1:01:26.578
And then I'll go to the authorities
and tell them.

1:01:26.663 --> 1:01:27.828
Tell them what?

1:01:29.163 --> 1:01:32.412
Oh, I know plenty if I care to tell.

1:01:40.746 --> 1:01:44.495
- What do you know?
- You wouldn't like that, would you?

1:01:44.579 --> 1:01:49.578
Well, if you don't marry me, I'll tell.

1:01:51.871 --> 1:01:54.287
Tell what?

1:01:54.371 --> 1:01:56.495
You know what I'm talking about.

1:01:58.454 --> 1:02:00.370
Proof, my dear.

1:02:00.454 --> 1:02:03.703
That's all the authorities
would be interested in.

1:02:03.788 --> 1:02:08.870
Proof. I want you out of this house
by tomorrow morning.

1:02:08.954 --> 1:02:16.954
I'll get proof.
Just you see. I'll get it.

1:03:58.413 --> 1:04:00.203
<i>(door creaks)</i>

1:05:05.538 --> 1:05:07.953

1:05:13.246 --> 1:05:14.370
<i>(faint noise)</i>

1:05:28.996 --> 1:05:31.578
<i>(whimpers)</i>

1:05:35.413 --> 1:05:37.037
<i>(screams)</i>

1:05:52.163 --> 1:05:54.995
Pass the marmalade
would you, Elizabeth?

1:05:55.663 --> 1:05:57.495
Thank you.

1:05:59.871 --> 1:06:01.537
- Victor?
- Hm-hmm.

1:06:02.746 --> 1:06:05.203
I'm worried about Justine.

1:06:05.288 --> 1:06:08.703
It's a week since she went away
and we've still had no word from her.

1:06:08.829 --> 1:06:13.078
I told you not to worry. I expect
some village Lothario eloped with her.

1:06:13.163 --> 1:06:15.912
She always was a romantic little thing.

1:06:17.829 --> 1:06:21.328
How are the wedding invitations
coming along? Had any replies yet?

1:06:21.413 --> 1:06:23.203
- Yes, quite a few.
- Oh.

1:06:24.996 --> 1:06:26.995
- Victor.
- Yes, Elizabeth?

1:06:27.079 --> 1:06:28.787
I've invited Paul to the wedding.

1:06:28.871 --> 1:06:31.662
After all, he was
a very good friend of yours.

1:06:34.746 --> 1:06:37.787
I'm sorry if I've done wrongly.

1:06:41.121 --> 1:06:45.537
He hasn't accepted yet
so maybe he won't come.

1:06:48.663 --> 1:06:50.078
I hope he <i>does</i> come.

1:06:53.038 --> 1:06:56.203
There's something I'd like him to see.

1:06:58.496 --> 1:07:01.328
<i>(string quartet plays)</i>

1:07:12.079 --> 1:07:14.870
To the bride and bridegroom.

1:07:18.329 --> 1:07:20.162
To the happy couple.

1:07:26.996 --> 1:07:32.245
- To the bridesmaids.
- What are you gibbering about?

1:07:32.329 --> 1:07:35.328
I was just rehearsing my speech,
my dear.

1:07:35.413 --> 1:07:38.453
Fool. That's not until tomorrow
after the wedding.

1:07:38.538 --> 1:07:41.537
Yes, I know, my dear,
but these things take time.

1:07:41.621 --> 1:07:46.495
- Come on. We're going home.
- So soon?

1:07:47.163 --> 1:07:49.370
Come on.

1:07:53.038 --> 1:07:55.370
<i>(sighs)</i>

1:07:55.454 --> 1:07:58.787
Thank heavens they've gone.
I've work to do upstairs.

1:07:58.871 --> 1:08:01.578
But, Victor, this is our wedding eve.
I thought...

1:08:01.663 --> 1:08:05.537
Oh, come, Elizabeth.
We are not sentimental young lovers.

1:08:05.621 --> 1:08:09.412
Can I come and watch you
working in your laboratory?

1:08:09.496 --> 1:08:13.995
No, no, my dear. Not yet.
But one day very soon.

1:08:17.288 --> 1:08:19.037
I promise you.

1:08:23.538 --> 1:08:25.245
It's a pity that Paul didn't come.

1:08:49.079 --> 1:08:51.328
Leave those till the morning, Ellen.

1:08:51.413 --> 1:08:53.370
Yes, Miss Elizabeth.

1:08:56.788 --> 1:08:58.703
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

1:09:05.663 --> 1:09:08.287
Good evening. I'm Herr Krempe.

1:09:08.371 --> 1:09:10.703
Are the Baron and Miss Elizabeth
at home?

1:09:10.788 --> 1:09:12.787
<i>- (Ellen)</i> Yes, sir.
- Paul!

1:09:12.871 --> 1:09:15.703
- Paul, how marvellous to see you!
- Elizabeth.

1:09:15.788 --> 1:09:17.620
We thought you weren't coming.

1:09:17.704 --> 1:09:20.745
Why, you look wonderful. And Victor?

1:09:20.829 --> 1:09:22.203
He's in his laboratory.

1:09:22.288 --> 1:09:25.120
He's been almost living up there
for the past few weeks.

1:09:25.204 --> 1:09:27.578
- What's he doing?
- As if I should know.

1:09:27.663 --> 1:09:31.245
I'll never know what goes on
behind that locked laboratory door.

1:09:31.329 --> 1:09:32.578
Of course, I forgot.

1:09:32.663 --> 1:09:35.828
But he'll be pleased to see you.
He was saying only yesterday

1:09:35.913 --> 1:09:39.662
that he wished you were here because
he has something he wants you to see.

1:09:39.746 --> 1:09:40.787
Has he?

1:09:40.871 --> 1:09:43.537
Why don't you go up
and surprise him now?

1:09:44.996 --> 1:09:46.412
I will.

1:10:04.288 --> 1:10:05.578
<i>(knocking at door)</i>

1:10:05.663 --> 1:10:07.745
- Who's there?
- Paul.

1:10:07.829 --> 1:10:09.162
Paul?

1:10:11.288 --> 1:10:13.328
Paul.

1:10:24.371 --> 1:10:27.578
Still keeping the door locked.
Is that necessary?

1:10:27.663 --> 1:10:30.745
You can judge for yourself in a moment.

1:10:30.829 --> 1:10:33.662
Elizabeth said
you had something to show me.

1:10:33.746 --> 1:10:35.620
Yes.

1:10:35.704 --> 1:10:38.912
Yes, Paul, I have.

1:10:39.621 --> 1:10:41.745
I've started on brain surgery, Paul.

1:11:01.288 --> 1:11:02.953
Nothing to say?

1:11:03.913 --> 1:11:06.203
- So it wasn't killed.
- Oh, it was.

1:11:06.288 --> 1:11:08.370
At least, life had passed from its body.

1:11:08.454 --> 1:11:11.995
But don't forget, I was the one
who put it there in the first place.

1:11:12.079 --> 1:11:14.953
It was comparatively easy to restore it.
No, wait, Paul.

1:11:15.079 --> 1:11:17.578
I want to show you something else.

1:11:17.663 --> 1:11:21.412
- I've seen enough.
- Wait, Paul!

1:11:21.496 --> 1:11:23.328
Watch this.

1:11:25.329 --> 1:11:27.078
Get up.

1:11:29.163 --> 1:11:30.412
Come on, get up.

1:11:43.288 --> 1:11:44.620
That's right.

1:11:46.413 --> 1:11:47.662
Now, come here.

1:11:49.538 --> 1:11:51.162
Come on, now.

1:11:51.913 --> 1:11:53.537
Come here!

1:12:03.079 --> 1:12:04.578
Sit.

1:12:05.621 --> 1:12:07.203
Sit down.

1:12:08.413 --> 1:12:09.703
Sit down!

1:12:19.704 --> 1:12:22.745
Is this your creature
of superior intellect?

1:12:22.829 --> 1:12:27.245
Your perfect physical being,
this animal?

1:12:27.329 --> 1:12:30.370
Ask it a question of advanced physics.

1:12:30.454 --> 1:12:34.620
It's got a brain with a lifetime
of knowledge. It should find it simple.

1:12:36.538 --> 1:12:39.078
Shall I tell you something, Paul?

1:12:39.163 --> 1:12:42.287
There you see the result
of your handiwork as much as mine.

1:12:42.371 --> 1:12:46.287
Oh, yes. I gave him life.
I put a brain in his head.

1:12:46.371 --> 1:12:48.370
But I chose a good brain,
a brilliant one.

1:12:48.454 --> 1:12:52.203
But it was you who damaged it. You who
put a bullet in the wretched thing.

1:12:53.454 --> 1:12:57.078
This is your fault, Paul.
Do you understand that?

1:12:57.163 --> 1:12:58.995
Your fault.

1:13:00.121 --> 1:13:01.828
Yes, I understand.

1:13:01.913 --> 1:13:07.078
But you won't win, Paul.
And shall I tell you why you won't win?

1:13:07.163 --> 1:13:09.245
Because I shall carry on.

1:13:09.329 --> 1:13:12.828
If I can't cure it by brain surgery,
then I'll get another brain.

1:13:12.913 --> 1:13:14.828
And another. And another.

1:13:14.913 --> 1:13:18.370
No, Victor! No, you will not!

1:13:20.538 --> 1:13:23.578
Paul! Paul, what are you going to do?

1:13:25.663 --> 1:13:28.370
Paul, what are you going to do?

1:13:28.454 --> 1:13:32.495
For your sake and to protect Elizabeth,
I've so far kept silent.

1:13:32.579 --> 1:13:36.287
But now I shall go to the authorities
and have them destroy that creature

1:13:36.371 --> 1:13:38.662
and see that you pay
for these atrocities.

1:13:38.788 --> 1:13:40.287
No!

1:13:54.204 --> 1:13:56.037
Paul, where are you going?

1:14:12.121 --> 1:14:15.912
Paul! Paul, wait a minute! Paul!
What are you going to gain by this?

1:14:15.996 --> 1:14:17.495
You're as much a part of it as I.

1:14:17.579 --> 1:14:19.620
I've had nothing to do with it
for months.

1:14:19.704 --> 1:14:22.078
Listen!
I've got something to say to you.

1:15:30.538 --> 1:15:32.787
<i>(chains rattle)</i>

1:16:20.954 --> 1:16:23.703
<i>- (splash)</i>
- Who's there?

1:16:23.788 --> 1:16:29.662
I warn you, if you tell the authorities,
Elizabeth will be the first to suffer.

1:16:32.663 --> 1:16:34.787
Victor! On the roof.

1:16:37.371 --> 1:16:38.662
We must get up there.

1:16:38.746 --> 1:16:41.412
Not this time.
I'm going to the village for help.

1:17:16.704 --> 1:17:19.162
<i>(stumbling footsteps)</i>

1:17:53.788 --> 1:17:57.078
<i>(Frankenstein)</i> Elizabeth! Come back!

1:17:57.163 --> 1:17:59.162
<i>(screams)</i>

1:18:08.621 --> 1:18:11.620
Get back! Get back!

1:18:19.538 --> 1:18:21.662
No. No.

1:18:24.663 --> 1:18:26.870
Get away from me!

1:18:26.996 --> 1:18:28.703
<i>(glass shatters)</i>

1:18:44.579 --> 1:18:45.787

<i>(fizzing)</i>

1:18:50.579 --> 1:18:52.870
<i>(Frankenstein)</i>
My life's work, destroyed.

1:18:54.079 --> 1:18:57.037
Destroyed in a moment.

1:18:57.121 --> 1:19:00.495
And by the same hand that gave it life.

1:19:00.621 --> 1:19:03.412
Within half an hour
there was nothing left of him.

1:19:04.954 --> 1:19:07.953
And that is my story.
That is what happened.

1:19:10.121 --> 1:19:12.662
You don't believe me, do you?

1:19:12.746 --> 1:19:15.537
You must believe me, do you hear?

1:19:17.913 --> 1:19:21.953
A visitor for you, Frankenstein.
Herr Krempe. Will you see him?

1:19:22.038 --> 1:19:26.787
Oh, yes. Yes! I knew it!
Paul wouldn't fail me.

1:19:26.871 --> 1:19:31.953
He'll tell you it's true. He knows.
He'll tell you it's true!

1:19:36.788 --> 1:19:38.537
Alright, he'll see you.

1:19:44.579 --> 1:19:47.703
I knew Paul wouldn't fail me.
He's been a good friend.

1:19:47.788 --> 1:19:51.578
He'll prove everything I said is true.
He knows.

1:19:51.663 --> 1:19:55.828
Paul! Paul, my dear friend Paul!

1:20:01.704 --> 1:20:03.453
Paul.

1:20:07.204 --> 1:20:11.453
Paul. Paul, my friend, tell them, Paul.

1:20:11.538 --> 1:20:12.912
Tell them what, Victor?

1:20:12.996 --> 1:20:16.453
About him. About the creature I made.

1:20:16.579 --> 1:20:20.828
Tell them. You were the only person to
see him apart from myself and Justine.

1:20:20.913 --> 1:20:22.995
The girl you murdered.

1:20:24.454 --> 1:20:28.328
But I didn't. That's what
I've been saying. It was him.

1:20:28.413 --> 1:20:32.328
- He did it.
- Who? Who did it, Victor?

1:20:32.913 --> 1:20:37.787
The creature I made!
You know. The man. Tell them.

1:20:42.621 --> 1:20:44.120
Oh, no! No, Paul!

1:20:44.204 --> 1:20:46.578
No, Paul, you must tell them.

1:20:46.663 --> 1:20:49.953
You know what's going to happen.
Only you can save me.

1:20:50.038 --> 1:20:52.828
You must tell them.

1:20:52.913 --> 1:20:56.245
Paul, I'll make you tell them!
I'll make you! Paul!

1:20:56.329 --> 1:20:59.328
Paul, you must tell them! Paul!

1:20:59.413 --> 1:21:03.453
Paul, you must tell them. Paul!

1:21:03.538 --> 1:21:08.412
I'm sorry, Paul, but you must tell them.
You must save me, Paul.

1:21:08.496 --> 1:21:11.287
Paul, you've got to save me!

1:21:12.413 --> 1:21:16.995
No! Paul! Paul! <i>(sobs)</i> Paul!

1:21:28.163 --> 1:21:31.328
There is nothing we can do for him now.

1:21:35.038 --> 1:21:38.287
Come on, I'll take you home.
