WEBVTT

00:38.580 --> 00:40.573
- Lemon drop?
- Not really my thing,

00:40.749 --> 00:42.409
but keep them coming
for everybody else.

00:42.584 --> 00:45.157
You know, if you ever get tired
of these downtown party ho's,

00:45.337 --> 00:47.080
I'm around.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.832
Whoa, I didn't think the Marines
made that much.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.879
- You're not from here, are you?
- Seattle. How did you know?

00:54.387 --> 00:56.463
L.A. Girls never ask
where the money comes from.

00:56.973 --> 00:58.550
I'm gonna take a lap.

00:58.724 --> 01:00.267
Catch you, Amy.

01:00.434 --> 01:02.807
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:03.437 --> 01:04.468
Yeah!

01:06.315 --> 01:07.430
Aw. Heh.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.398
Yo, B.

01:12.863 --> 01:14.571
What's up, Alex?

01:19.328 --> 01:21.237
On top of the world, dog.

01:22.372 --> 01:23.866
What's up?

01:33.425 --> 01:35.168
Over here. Whoo!

01:39.055 --> 01:40.715
Brandon Valdivia.

01:40.890 --> 01:42.219
No way.

01:42.392 --> 01:43.802
It's not true.

01:44.310 --> 01:46.599
Where's Brandon?

02:25.892 --> 02:27.351
- Is this an argument?
- No.

02:27.519 --> 02:31.137
A difference of opinion. I happen
to be right, you happen to be wrong.

02:31.314 --> 02:33.769
For the record,
I'm right, you're wrong.

02:33.941 --> 02:35.649
Operators are made,
they're not born, G.

02:35.818 --> 02:37.360
- Skills can be taught.
- Mm-hm.

02:37.528 --> 02:38.809
Hey, what was that guy's name?

02:38.988 --> 02:41.693
- Swishman? Fishman?
- Swisher.

02:41.866 --> 02:43.858
- Swisher. Chuck Swisher.
- Chuck Swisher.

02:44.035 --> 02:46.407
Used to sit and study the ops manual
in the UC van.

02:46.579 --> 02:47.907
- Yeah.
- Knew the regulation book

02:48.080 --> 02:50.701
backwards and forwards.
Terrible operator.

02:50.875 --> 02:53.544
Yeah, who used to overcompensate
for his lack of undercover skill

02:53.711 --> 02:55.537
by knowing everything
about surveillance.

02:55.713 --> 02:58.382
That doesn't make him a bad agent.
Teachers learn to be teachers,

02:58.549 --> 03:00.209
cops learn to be cops.

03:00.384 --> 03:03.088
And somebody taught Lebron
how to dunk from the free-throw line.

03:03.261 --> 03:06.049
- SEALs learn to be SEALs, G.
- Oh, that's right.

03:06.223 --> 03:08.180
You couldn't swim when you enlisted,
could you?

03:08.350 --> 03:10.177
How long did they
let you wear the floaties?

03:11.311 --> 03:13.718
Look,
I will take a lazy natural operator

03:13.897 --> 03:15.889
over an all-night studier
any day of the week.

03:16.066 --> 03:18.735
- It's too late, I already did it.
- Mm-hm.

03:19.903 --> 03:23.271
Nature versus nurture.
Quite the conundrum.

03:23.448 --> 03:26.484
You cannot use the word "conundrum"
before 9:30, Hetty.

03:27.326 --> 03:30.530
Nine thirty-one, which means,
Mr. Callen, you're late.

03:30.705 --> 03:32.247
So are you, Mr. Hanna.

03:32.415 --> 03:34.241
Late for what?

03:37.503 --> 03:40.338
Corporal Brandon Valdivia.
Twenty-five, single.

03:40.506 --> 03:42.712
Went off the roof
of the downtown Apex last night.

03:42.883 --> 03:46.584
Valdivia was stationed at a supply unit
at Camp Pendleton.

03:46.762 --> 03:49.549
He just returned from a deployment
in Iraq three months ago.

03:49.723 --> 03:51.051
Diagnosed PTSD.

03:51.225 --> 03:53.431
Possible suicidal ideation,
anxiety disorder.

03:53.602 --> 03:55.594
And because of his
mental health history,

03:55.771 --> 03:57.847
L.A.P.D. Has already ruled it a suicide.

03:58.023 --> 03:59.896
And we're investigating because?

04:00.066 --> 04:02.984
Valdivia's family
is tight with their congressman.

04:03.820 --> 04:06.276
The congressman calls SECNAV,

04:06.448 --> 04:09.152
SECNAV calls the commandant
of the Marine Corps

04:09.325 --> 04:11.697
who calls Director Vance.

04:11.869 --> 04:13.992
It's the proverbial Pentagon shuffle.

04:14.163 --> 04:16.833
Downtown Apex
is a high-end party spot.

04:16.999 --> 04:19.288
They mix a meaningful mojito.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.951
They have the most marvellous
pool on the roof.

04:22.129 --> 04:27.503
It stays open all night
and it's kept at a balmy 92 degrees.

04:30.888 --> 04:33.805
Have you people
never heard of a staycation?

04:38.979 --> 04:42.063
Did Valdivia have any kind of record?
In the service or out?

04:42.232 --> 04:43.607
No, not even a parking ticket.

04:43.775 --> 04:47.559
- Did he have a room at the Apex?
- No, but I got a hit

04:47.737 --> 04:50.738
on some turn-on service notices
for gas and electric.

04:50.907 --> 04:53.315
The Social Security number
matches Valdivia's.

04:53.493 --> 04:55.651
Looks like he had
an off-base apartment.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.074
Culver City.

04:57.247 --> 05:00.829
What's he doing with an apartment
90 miles from Pendleton?

05:01.084 --> 05:04.287
Certainly not taking a staycation.

05:16.682 --> 05:19.054
So do you think Hetty
was born or made?

05:19.226 --> 05:20.341
Hatched.

05:20.519 --> 05:22.725
How long have we been
working together, G?

05:23.230 --> 05:26.017
- Two years?
- Three next month.

05:26.191 --> 05:28.184
And the longest you ever had
the same partner was?

05:28.360 --> 05:29.391
Your point?

05:29.570 --> 05:30.980
Point is we complement each other.

05:31.154 --> 05:32.981
- I'm a natural...
- I'm natural, you're made.

05:33.156 --> 05:34.401
No, I'm the natural operator.

05:34.574 --> 05:37.908
Well, if you're natural,
I'm supernatural.

05:38.078 --> 05:40.154
That doesn't even make sense.

05:40.330 --> 05:44.244
Let's see if Valdivia
left anything for us.

05:55.845 --> 05:56.876
Clear.

05:59.098 --> 06:00.592
Clear.

06:02.935 --> 06:03.966
ESPN.

06:04.145 --> 06:06.054
Military Channel.

06:08.232 --> 06:11.186
Hoo-rah. I win.

06:12.361 --> 06:14.650
- Beer and mustard.
- You sure you don't live here?

06:14.822 --> 06:18.570
Meaningless sex with an endless
stream of beautiful women.

06:18.742 --> 06:20.367
How empty.

06:22.621 --> 06:24.281
This guy look depressed to you?

06:24.956 --> 06:26.748
No suicide note.

06:27.292 --> 06:28.620
It's like a post office in here.

06:28.793 --> 06:30.751
What do you think
this guy was sending?

06:30.921 --> 06:32.960
- "Guitar Hero."
- What?

06:33.131 --> 06:37.378
I got receipts for the last two weeks
for 20, 40, 60, 80...

06:37.552 --> 06:40.506
A hundred and 60 copies
of "Guitar Hero."

06:43.725 --> 06:45.432
All paid for in cash.

06:46.727 --> 06:49.301
A bunch of mom-and-pop shops.

06:49.564 --> 06:51.141
Two and three at a time.

06:51.315 --> 06:53.557
Why buy multiple copies
of a video game?

06:53.734 --> 06:56.142
- Because it kicks major ass.
- I'll tell you one thing,

06:56.320 --> 06:58.396
this guy Valdivia
was overpaying bigtime.

06:58.572 --> 07:02.190
So basically, we've got a dead Marine
with no skill at volume-buying.

07:02.368 --> 07:03.530
Oh, ye of little faith.

07:04.286 --> 07:06.528
We've got receipts.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.369
- Ever play "Guitar Hero"?
- Mm-mm.

07:09.708 --> 07:11.036
I prefer the real thing.

07:11.209 --> 07:13.202
Django Reinhardt, Gabor Szabo,

07:13.378 --> 07:15.170
a little Hendrix
thrown in for good measure.

07:15.338 --> 07:18.043
Dominic Vaile, I am liking you
more and more every day.

07:18.216 --> 07:21.087
Speaking of video games,

07:21.261 --> 07:24.760
Brandon Valdivia
went off the roof here,

07:24.931 --> 07:27.636
and landed here, 227 feet down.

07:27.809 --> 07:30.679
Now, normally, determining
cause of death in a high fall

07:30.853 --> 07:32.182
is all about launch speed.

07:32.355 --> 07:35.190
This one is more about
angle and placement.

07:35.358 --> 07:38.892
Valdivia landed on his back,
relatively close to the building,

07:39.070 --> 07:43.648
arms spread, in what's known as
the upturned-crucifix position.

07:43.824 --> 07:45.733
That's a long way down.

07:45.910 --> 07:47.949
His body could have flipped over
during the fall.

07:48.120 --> 07:50.113
- Unlikely.
- But not impossible.

07:50.289 --> 07:52.281
Also, he had a broken jaw.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.415
- From the fall?
- Not if he landed on his back.

07:54.585 --> 07:56.245
And there was no bruising
on the face,

07:56.420 --> 07:58.128
which indicates
that the break was fresh.

07:58.297 --> 08:01.132
- He was punched.
- Brandon Valdivia was unconscious

08:01.300 --> 08:02.710
before he even went over the rail.

08:02.884 --> 08:04.877
So someone knocked him out
with a shot to the jaw

08:05.053 --> 08:06.631
and threw him backwards
off the roof.

08:06.805 --> 08:09.260
Our suicide just became a murder.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.386
It would take someone pretty strong

08:35.554 --> 08:38.758
to throw a 200-pound Marine
off the side.

08:44.272 --> 08:46.597
Eric, I got one camera
up on the roof.

08:46.774 --> 08:49.312
- I'm on it.
- It's even better at night.

08:49.485 --> 08:52.107
- Most things are.
- I'm the events coordinator.

08:52.280 --> 08:54.189
- Callen.
- Special Agent Kensi Blye.

08:54.365 --> 08:55.824
Did you know Brandon Valdivia?

08:55.992 --> 08:58.565
Everybody knew Brandon.
It's so sad.

08:58.744 --> 09:00.452
Was he a guest
at a lot of these parties?

09:00.621 --> 09:01.819
Guest? He was the host.

09:01.997 --> 09:04.619
For the last three Saturday nights,
Brandon paid for everything.

09:05.876 --> 09:06.907
How much are we talking?

09:07.086 --> 09:10.585
Open bar, hors d'oeuvres,
tray-passed shots.

09:10.756 --> 09:13.247
This week, 27,000. In cash.

09:14.676 --> 09:15.957
That didn't surprise you?

09:16.136 --> 09:17.547
Who questions cash?

09:17.721 --> 09:19.429
Don't ask, don't tell.

09:19.598 --> 09:21.839
Amy was his waitress.

09:22.851 --> 09:24.393
I'll be back.

09:25.312 --> 09:27.019
You waited on
Brandon Valdivia last night?

09:27.188 --> 09:28.220
He wasn't drinking.

09:28.398 --> 09:30.521
Did you see him with anyone
in particular?

09:30.692 --> 09:33.313
Just this guy he always hung with.
Alex, I think.

09:33.486 --> 09:34.684
I don't know his last name.

09:34.862 --> 09:37.484
Did you ever see Brandon and Alex
ever get into it or anything?

09:37.657 --> 09:40.693
Fight? No. They loved it here.
Especially Alex.

09:41.202 --> 09:44.653
You know, all you meet in this job
is Euro trash and wannabe actors.

09:44.830 --> 09:45.993
Brandon was different.

09:46.165 --> 09:48.703
He actually cared about who I was,
where I was from.

09:48.876 --> 09:52.541
He had a lot of money, but mostly
he seemed like a nice, smart guy.

09:53.589 --> 09:56.839
Now he's gone and that sucks.

09:57.760 --> 09:58.922
I got customers.

10:02.222 --> 10:03.253
Hey, I'll be right back.

10:03.432 --> 10:06.302
All right,
your Alex is most likely Alex Walder.

10:06.476 --> 10:07.757
He was Valdivia's rackmate.

10:07.936 --> 10:09.478
They were deployed together in Iraq,

10:09.646 --> 10:12.102
and now they're assigned
to the supply unit.

10:12.274 --> 10:17.434
Okay, the Staff NCO in charge
is Gunnery Sergeant Jerrold Mulhearn.

10:17.612 --> 10:20.020
Yeah, but he ships so much gear
out of Pendleton,

10:20.198 --> 10:22.190
that they call him Gunny Pallet.

10:22.367 --> 10:24.822
Like a pallet? Okay.

10:25.411 --> 10:28.412
Great. Okay. All right, Sam and
Callen are headed to the base,

10:28.581 --> 10:30.906
and Kensi's coming back here.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.494
The quality's lousy.

10:32.668 --> 10:35.420
Yeah. Not good enough
to run facial recognition.

10:35.588 --> 10:36.619
What about the elevators?

10:36.797 --> 10:39.917
All right.
Accessing last night's footage now.

10:40.092 --> 10:42.215
Anyone pushing the top button
went to the roof.

10:45.681 --> 10:46.926
Hello.

10:49.143 --> 10:53.804
If only your vocabularies
could be augmented as much.

10:58.485 --> 11:00.810
Busted.

11:03.114 --> 11:06.317
We move more gear than
any other dock in the Marine Corps.

11:06.826 --> 11:08.534
A hundred-thousand tons a year.

11:08.703 --> 11:11.075
Everything from TOW missiles
to toilet paper.

11:11.247 --> 11:12.576
That's impressive.

11:12.749 --> 11:14.658
Any idea who would wanna see
Corporal Valdivia

11:14.834 --> 11:16.625
take a swan dive off a roof?

11:16.794 --> 11:18.123
Not a lick.

11:18.296 --> 11:21.830
Kid was too stupid to have enemies.
I mean, no offence to the dead,

11:22.008 --> 11:24.759
but that rock couldn't pour water
out of a boot

11:24.927 --> 11:26.469
with instructions on the heel.

11:26.637 --> 11:28.096
What about his hootchmate?

11:28.264 --> 11:29.806
- Lance Corporal Walder?
- Yeah.

11:29.974 --> 11:31.516
Dumber than a box of air.

11:31.684 --> 11:35.349
Went to Sickbay this morning.
Probably swallowed his toothbrush.

11:35.521 --> 11:36.719
Those two get along?

11:36.897 --> 11:39.139
Yeah. Like Dumb & Dumber.

11:39.316 --> 11:43.266
Walder followed Valdivia around
like a little lost puppy.

11:43.445 --> 11:45.023
Until last week.

11:45.197 --> 11:48.530
They got up in each other's grill,
ended up rolling around on the deck.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.535
I figured I either had to pull them apart
or turn a hose on them.

11:51.703 --> 11:54.574
- You know what that was about?
- Hell, no. I just wanted it to stop.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.574
Appreciate it, gunny.

11:57.167 --> 11:59.658
Look like you still handle yourself.
You a Marine?

11:59.836 --> 12:02.208
Navy. Been out a while, though.

12:02.380 --> 12:05.334
I'm just an old box kicker,
so you take this with a grain of salt,

12:05.508 --> 12:07.584
but there was a time
when you could make these kids

12:07.760 --> 12:08.923
into regular Marines.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.800
Now if they aren't gangbangers
or convicts,

12:11.973 --> 12:14.261
they're just some other kind of
major knucklehead.

12:14.433 --> 12:16.640
It's almost getting too hard
to be worth it.

12:16.811 --> 12:17.890
I hear you.

12:18.062 --> 12:20.600
I said, almost.

12:20.773 --> 12:22.646
Yeah, right.

12:22.858 --> 12:25.349
Hello! Brain-dead.
I see half a dozen...

12:25.527 --> 12:28.065
Gunny Pallet said
Walder went to Sickbay.

12:28.238 --> 12:30.812
No, I checked.
He's not there and he's not in his rack.

12:30.991 --> 12:32.900
I said move!

12:33.827 --> 12:37.362
Eric. Yeah, get me an ID
on Alex Walder's vehicle.

12:37.539 --> 12:40.456
- Tell me if it's left the base.
- Checking that for you right now.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.914
Why buy multiple copies
of the same video game?

12:43.086 --> 12:47.084
When I see multiple purchases,
Resale.

12:47.257 --> 12:49.878
People buy stuff
and sell it online all the time.

12:50.051 --> 12:51.794
All right,
so first we search for the item,

12:51.970 --> 12:54.757
and then we see
who has the most active listings.

12:54.931 --> 12:57.766
Biggest local seller
is B Dog V in Culver City.

12:58.267 --> 13:00.307
Brandon Valdivia.

13:00.478 --> 13:03.099
He was buying the games
for an average of $129,

13:03.272 --> 13:05.728
but selling them
for half that at auction.

13:06.275 --> 13:08.517
Buy high, sell low.
That doesn't make sense.

13:08.694 --> 13:09.809
Maybe they were fakes.

13:09.987 --> 13:12.774
No, his feedback is perfect.
A hundred percent. Right there.

13:14.867 --> 13:18.485
Maybe we're looking
at the wrong side of the equation.

13:19.913 --> 13:21.906
Eric, can you compare the retailers

13:22.082 --> 13:24.999
where Valdivia bought the games
to each other?

13:25.961 --> 13:28.084
Well, we already know
they were small operations.

13:28.255 --> 13:31.374
I mean, they aren't owned by the same
family, if that's what you mean.

13:31.550 --> 13:33.174
They're spread out
all over L.A. County.

13:33.343 --> 13:35.252
No discernible geographic pattern.

13:35.428 --> 13:37.088
What about where the stores
got the games?

13:37.263 --> 13:39.256
Distributors? Wholesalers?

13:41.726 --> 13:44.643
All right. Different wholesalers.

13:44.812 --> 13:46.520
A few had the same distributor.

13:46.689 --> 13:51.315
They all use different banks,
but each bank is...

13:51.485 --> 13:52.766
Wait for it.

13:54.322 --> 13:57.239
On the Secret Service
Counterfeit Currency Alert.

13:57.408 --> 13:58.902
Different banks, different reporting.

13:59.076 --> 14:01.234
That's why Valdivia
went to so many different stores.

14:01.412 --> 14:04.911
And that's why it took Treasury
two weeks to issue an alert.

14:05.082 --> 14:06.706
Valdivia bought
all those video games

14:06.875 --> 14:10.624
with what the Treasury is calling
top-quality counterfeit bills.

14:10.796 --> 14:13.334
- I gotta call you back.
- Thanks, Eric.

14:13.507 --> 14:14.917
He bought them with the fakes,

14:15.092 --> 14:17.962
sold them online,
got real money in return.

14:18.386 --> 14:19.964
Not a bad little plan.

14:20.138 --> 14:22.214
Yeah,
but where is a 25-year-old corporal

14:22.390 --> 14:24.430
getting high-quality
counterfeit Benjies?

14:24.601 --> 14:26.677
The quality is too good
for them to be homemade.

14:26.853 --> 14:27.968
He's probably buying them.

14:28.146 --> 14:29.308
[CELL PHONE RINGS

14:29.481 --> 14:31.603
- Yeah.
- All right, take a look at your laptop.

14:31.774 --> 14:33.518
I'm streaming you something now.

14:33.693 --> 14:35.317
Got a search
going through Kaleidoscope,

14:35.486 --> 14:37.064
and I got a hit on Alex Walder's car.

14:37.238 --> 14:40.488
- Where?
- It just went off Pier 60 in San Pedro.

14:40.658 --> 14:42.366
They're trying to locate any survivors.

14:42.535 --> 14:44.777
The accident was caught
on a dockside security camera.

14:44.954 --> 14:46.946
Stunned onlookers
watched in horror

14:47.123 --> 14:50.871
as the car went off the pier
into Los Angeles Harbour.

15:09.093 --> 15:10.503
You got it.

15:10.677 --> 15:11.922
All clear.

15:23.940 --> 15:25.399
Thanks.

15:31.781 --> 15:35.150
Okay.
So Valdivia gets tossed off a building,

15:35.660 --> 15:38.945
and Walder takes a long drive
off a short pier.

15:39.122 --> 15:42.455
Somehow, they're all connected
over counterfeit hundreds.

15:42.625 --> 15:43.953
You're going in, right?

15:44.126 --> 15:46.084
The police divers can handle it,
I'm sure.

15:46.254 --> 15:47.878
Yeah, but you're a SEAL.

15:48.047 --> 15:50.716
You've been looking a little pale lately,
maybe you should go.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.041
Uh-uh. Too many bullet holes
in me, Sam, I'd sink.

15:54.428 --> 15:58.508
Well, the tide's going out. The body
could have floated out after impact.

15:58.682 --> 16:00.639
Current would have
pulled him away pretty quick.

16:00.809 --> 16:04.059
Eric? You got any more security
camera angles here at Pier 60?

16:04.229 --> 16:05.640
Already checking.

16:05.814 --> 16:08.934
Oh, and the Secret Service wants
to talk to you about counterfeit bills.

16:09.109 --> 16:11.148
- Stall them.
- Too late.

16:16.575 --> 16:19.825
Natalie Giordano, Secret Service.
I like your clubhouse.

16:19.994 --> 16:22.830
You guys got a secret handshake
and a stash of girlie mags?

16:23.331 --> 16:25.537
- Sam Hanna.
- Callen.

16:26.626 --> 16:27.705
Just Callen.

16:27.877 --> 16:30.664
Nice to meet you, Callen,
"Just Callen."

16:35.426 --> 16:38.261
These are the bills
that Valdivia passed.

16:39.055 --> 16:43.551
1995 series.
Rotating serial numbers.

16:44.226 --> 16:45.768
Beautiful craftsmanship.

16:45.936 --> 16:50.812
Portrait, vignette, ornaments,
lettering, script, scrollwork.

16:51.567 --> 16:53.939
Not some Photoshop job either.

16:56.071 --> 16:59.274
These were printed in a press
with real plates.

16:59.449 --> 17:01.074
These are seriously tight.

17:01.243 --> 17:03.568
We need to get into
the distribution network

17:03.745 --> 17:05.702
and find out who sold these bills
to Valdivia.

17:05.872 --> 17:08.030
We're tracking a murder.

17:09.626 --> 17:11.951
Generally, hundreds show up
in Las Vegas near the casinos

17:12.127 --> 17:15.046
where no one bats an eye at big bills.
That's where I'm stationed.

17:15.214 --> 17:17.088
Do you ever get up to Vegas?

17:17.258 --> 17:18.337
Now and then.

17:20.636 --> 17:22.214
Hundreds are double hard
to counterfeit

17:22.387 --> 17:25.140
because they have to beat the pen.

17:25.683 --> 17:28.684
On counterfeit notes, the detection pen
reacts to the starch in the paper

17:28.853 --> 17:30.051
and turns brown.

17:30.229 --> 17:34.476
So the printing quality is amazing,
the paper, not so much.

17:34.650 --> 17:37.271
That's why Valdivia passed them
at the mom-and-pop stores.

17:37.444 --> 17:39.069
Less likely to use the pen.

17:39.238 --> 17:41.230
So I say it's an open book
on everything we find.

17:41.406 --> 17:43.399
I catch my counterfeiter,
you catch your murderer.

17:43.575 --> 17:45.651
Who knows?
Maybe it's one and the same.

17:46.161 --> 17:47.276
Ain't it great to share?

17:48.955 --> 17:51.114
Well, regardless,
I will be staying here

17:51.291 --> 17:53.414
until we get a collar
on whoever printed these.

17:53.585 --> 17:56.206
Can you recommend
any good restaurants nearby?

17:56.379 --> 17:58.419
FYI, no salads.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.713
I think room service
is probably your best bet.

18:03.761 --> 18:05.006
Room service? Really?

18:05.179 --> 18:07.931
She did leave that door pretty
wide open with the restaurant thing.

18:08.099 --> 18:09.677
Could have drove
a truck through it, G.

18:09.851 --> 18:11.974
I don't date law enforcement.

18:12.145 --> 18:13.804
Might wanna make an exception
this time.

18:13.980 --> 18:17.230
Sam, you know the rule.
They got their own handcuffs, I'm out.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.060
Look,
I think you're making a big mistake.

18:19.235 --> 18:21.607
The room service she wants to order
isn't on the menu.

18:21.779 --> 18:23.855
Eric, tell me something good.

18:24.031 --> 18:26.948
I got into the traffic cams on the pier.
I pulled this.

18:27.117 --> 18:29.822
It's not the best image,
but it's good enough to see.

18:29.995 --> 18:31.655
Nobody in the driver's seat.

18:31.830 --> 18:35.199
A few people on the pier,
they see the car go over.

18:35.500 --> 18:36.995
They run toward the crash.

18:38.712 --> 18:41.499
Except that guy. He's walking away.

18:41.965 --> 18:44.290
Zoom, zoom, zoom.

18:46.469 --> 18:48.758
I ran him through facial recognition.

18:50.014 --> 18:51.758
Hello, Alex.

18:51.933 --> 18:54.768
Guys, we've got a broadcast beacon
from Walder's phone.

18:54.936 --> 18:55.967
Begins at the pier.

18:56.145 --> 18:58.636
He checks his voicemails,
then switches off his phone.

18:58.815 --> 19:01.566
He's only done this four times,
but it's enough to track a pattern.

19:01.734 --> 19:04.439
It runs north up the 405
to the 10 East.

19:04.612 --> 19:07.862
He could have hitched a ride
or jumped in the back of a truck.

19:08.032 --> 19:11.899
Hey, nine minutes ago, someone
checked Walder's cell-phone voicemail

19:12.077 --> 19:13.904
from a pay phone
on Wilshire and Western.

19:14.079 --> 19:17.080
He's using pay phones now.
He thinks it's harder to trace.

19:17.249 --> 19:19.076
He's moving east, and fast.

19:19.251 --> 19:21.208
I mean, what is Walder doing?

19:21.378 --> 19:23.584
What a good Marine is supposed to,
improvising.

19:23.755 --> 19:26.460
Bring up the L.A. Metro map.
I wanna see the Purple Line.

19:27.092 --> 19:29.844
He's on the subway.
Next stop is the last one.

19:30.345 --> 19:31.673
Seventh and Fig.

19:31.847 --> 19:33.923
A block away from the Apex Hotel.

19:34.849 --> 19:38.301
- Why is he going back there?
- Maybe he left something behind.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.060
Walder.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.029
Don't do it. Don't do...

19:56.787 --> 19:58.412
Let me go! Let me go!

20:01.041 --> 20:02.536
Get your hands behind your back.

20:02.710 --> 20:05.627
What's the matter with you?
You trying to jump off the roof?

20:06.422 --> 20:10.040
What do you have here?
What do you have here? What is this?

20:23.579 --> 20:25.571
- Are you crazy?
- No.

20:25.748 --> 20:27.408
Then you must have been
real scared then.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.207
So scared you thought
jumping off a roof

20:29.376 --> 20:30.870
was better than
getting caught by us?

20:34.214 --> 20:35.625
Who did you think we were, Alex?

20:35.799 --> 20:37.792
Why did you go back to the roof?

20:38.051 --> 20:39.510
I wanted to honour my friend.

20:39.678 --> 20:41.801
- To be close to him.
- Maybe you shouldn't have

20:41.972 --> 20:44.260
- thrown him off the roof.
- I didn't kill Brandon.

20:44.432 --> 20:45.677
He was my best friend.

20:45.850 --> 20:47.930
Every day in Iraq,
I was sure we weren't coming back,

20:48.103 --> 20:51.020
but Brandon was like, "Dog,
keep your head down and follow me."

20:51.689 --> 20:54.607
And I did.
I did and I came back home.

20:54.776 --> 20:56.536
Your gunny said
he had to pull you two apart.

20:56.694 --> 20:58.770
I was trying to get him
to stop having the parties.

20:58.946 --> 21:00.571
Stop spending the money.

21:00.740 --> 21:02.198
I told him.

21:02.366 --> 21:03.991
He was gonna get killed for it.

21:04.160 --> 21:05.322
Killed by who?

21:09.623 --> 21:11.532
There was this kid.

21:12.084 --> 21:13.709
Jason.

21:15.546 --> 21:17.871
He was a couple years
older than me,

21:18.048 --> 21:20.337
I lived with him in a foster home.

21:20.592 --> 21:21.837
He looked out for me.

21:23.136 --> 21:25.971
Not for any other reason,
it was just the right thing to do.

21:27.265 --> 21:30.634
He used to make up
these "G" names for me.

21:30.810 --> 21:35.188
G-Money, G-Ride, G-Force.

21:35.398 --> 21:40.190
One night, our foster dad got drunk
and he beat him to death.

21:42.405 --> 21:46.153
I felt bad because I didn't do anything
to help him.

21:50.288 --> 21:51.568
I still do.

21:54.250 --> 21:57.037
Who killed Brandon, Alex?

21:58.879 --> 22:00.623
Rick.

22:00.839 --> 22:02.749
Rick Pargo.

22:07.930 --> 22:12.259
Wow, that was pretty damn cool,
Callen. Any of it true?

22:13.935 --> 22:15.975
Rick Pargo. You know him?

22:17.314 --> 22:18.689
Blast from the past.

22:20.066 --> 22:22.557
He's pretty well known
by our guys at Treasury.

22:22.736 --> 22:25.523
Commercial printer charged
with forgery and counterfeiting.

22:25.697 --> 22:28.270
Seven times and no convictions.

22:28.450 --> 22:30.608
I mean,
we've been after this guy for years.

22:30.785 --> 22:33.620
Eric, see if you can place Rick Pargo
on the hotel rooftop

22:33.788 --> 22:35.615
the night Brandon Valdivia
was killed.

22:35.790 --> 22:37.249
Checking that for you right now.

22:40.086 --> 22:42.493
- Nate?
- He is terrified.

22:42.672 --> 22:44.581
- You're kidding.
- So why go back to the place

22:44.757 --> 22:47.129
your friend was murdered?

22:47.301 --> 22:49.757
He said he wanted to
honour his friend?

22:49.929 --> 22:52.466
Fear is a primal instinct.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.466
It overrules everything,

22:54.641 --> 22:58.141
including cerebral concepts
like honour.

22:58.312 --> 23:00.600
Whatever took him back there
was so important

23:00.772 --> 23:02.646
that he had to suppress his fear.

23:02.816 --> 23:06.730
Until he ran into you guys
and then the fear kicked back in.

23:06.903 --> 23:09.573
And I don't blame him. I'd probably
wanna throw myself off a roof

23:09.739 --> 23:12.526
if I saw you guys coming at me too.

23:13.451 --> 23:15.408
You left a few things out, Alex.

23:15.578 --> 23:17.986
- What? No.
- You heard of good cop, bad cop?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.327
This is bad cop, bad cop.

23:19.499 --> 23:22.072
He can do things to make
waterboarding feel like a sponge bath.

23:22.252 --> 23:25.620
You said you went back to honour him.
What do you know about honour?

23:28.049 --> 23:31.667
We were on patrol in Baghdad,
clearing buildings.

23:31.844 --> 23:34.169
We were in this huge old print shop.

23:34.347 --> 23:36.553
Had presses and plates
and everything.

23:38.058 --> 23:39.968
We took a look at the plates.

23:40.144 --> 23:42.017
They were
for making American money.

23:42.187 --> 23:44.014
Hundred-dollar bills.

23:44.565 --> 23:46.557
We took a set of plates,
hid them with our gear,

23:46.733 --> 23:48.607
smuggled them
when we came back.

23:48.777 --> 23:50.900
- Where did you find Rick Pargo?
- He found us.

23:51.071 --> 23:52.613
Someone must have told him.

23:52.781 --> 23:53.896
We gave Pargo the plates.

23:54.074 --> 23:56.565
- He made some test batches, but...
- The paper wasn't good.

23:56.743 --> 24:00.527
Brandon was supposed to destroy the
bills. Instead, he laundered them online.

24:01.081 --> 24:03.868
One more question. What's this?

24:04.834 --> 24:06.708
Brandon gave it to me
the night he was killed.

24:06.878 --> 24:08.502
It's a serial-number generator.

24:08.671 --> 24:12.455
Agent Giordano,
we're in the middle of something here.

24:12.634 --> 24:15.303
I thought we were gonna share.

24:22.977 --> 24:26.559
It generates a new serial number
on counterfeit bills.

24:26.730 --> 24:27.975
This is a good one too.

24:28.149 --> 24:31.149
Saddam had master forgers
working all over Iraq.

24:31.318 --> 24:34.521
That's why they're printing
1995-series bills.

24:34.697 --> 24:36.025
They're using old plates.

24:37.074 --> 24:38.865
A hell of a case
you guys stumbled into.

24:41.078 --> 24:42.904
You're a bartender.

24:43.080 --> 24:45.784
You work at a little place
in the valley.

24:45.957 --> 24:48.627
Yeah,
I'm also Alex Walder's girlfriend.

24:48.793 --> 24:52.625
Oh, the things we do for our country.

24:52.797 --> 24:57.543
Ha, ha. I once had to hide in a cake.

25:00.179 --> 25:01.638
Never mind.

25:02.140 --> 25:05.343
That brute, Pargo,
will undoubtedly frisk you,

25:05.518 --> 25:08.353
so a wire is out of the question.

25:09.146 --> 25:11.305
- Ah. Watch.
- Ah-ha.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.309
Tank style, leather band.

25:14.485 --> 25:18.732
Microphone and transmitter
smartly concealed within.

25:18.906 --> 25:20.780
I like.

25:20.950 --> 25:23.737
Rick Pargo is, in many respects,
a classic narcissist.

25:24.244 --> 25:26.735
He's beaten seven cases against him
in the past.

25:26.914 --> 25:30.532
I consulted on one of them
and I saw him in the courtroom.

25:30.709 --> 25:34.707
He literally acts like he's above the law
and that makes him very dangerous.

25:35.589 --> 25:37.581
Okay. I'll tread lightly.

25:37.757 --> 25:40.165
Pargo will construe
any conciliatory gestures as weakness.

25:40.343 --> 25:44.388
It's best if you consider
at least one well-timed bold gesture.

25:44.556 --> 25:46.133
Like kicking his ass?

25:46.307 --> 25:47.718
One more thing.

25:47.892 --> 25:51.842
Courtesy of our colleague
from the Secret Service.

25:52.438 --> 25:53.470
Have you met her yet?

25:53.648 --> 25:56.317
I have not yet met Agent Giordano,

25:56.484 --> 26:01.229
but I'm under the impression
from multiple sources

26:02.156 --> 26:04.113
that you could take her.

26:17.588 --> 26:19.414
I'm looking for Rick Pargo.

26:19.590 --> 26:20.621
Who's asking?

26:20.799 --> 26:22.459
Alex Walder's girlfriend.

26:23.552 --> 26:24.880
Never heard of him.

26:39.609 --> 26:41.186
This way.

26:44.906 --> 26:46.649
You a cop?

26:50.911 --> 26:53.581
I can't hear.
This guy's not taking any chances.

26:53.748 --> 26:55.574
How long do you wanna give her?

26:55.750 --> 26:57.493
A minute. Then we go in.

26:59.587 --> 27:01.330
Enjoying yourself?

27:01.505 --> 27:03.130
Are you?

27:03.716 --> 27:05.174
You got my number generator?

27:06.093 --> 27:07.587
It's safe, like Alex.

27:07.761 --> 27:10.003
- Alex is dead.
- So you think.

27:10.806 --> 27:14.257
I believe you might be interested
in seeing this.

27:22.984 --> 27:24.182
Born operator.

27:24.736 --> 27:25.767
Yeah.

27:25.945 --> 27:28.187
Well, then, maybe we'll call Alex

27:28.364 --> 27:31.199
and tell him to bring
the number generator over here.

27:31.367 --> 27:34.238
If he wants to see you alive again.

27:38.666 --> 27:40.244
Hold it.

27:41.085 --> 27:43.540
- Move away.
- My boyfriend's an idiot.

27:43.713 --> 27:45.088
I'm just here to make a deal.

27:45.256 --> 27:46.916
That was really impressive.

27:47.091 --> 27:48.633
I think I like you.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.081
All right, darling.

27:53.097 --> 27:55.173
With the number generator in place,

27:55.349 --> 27:57.887
I can print 20 million
in under two hours.

27:58.769 --> 28:01.057
- What stopped you before?
- Paper.

28:01.229 --> 28:03.388
Yours can't beat the pen, can it?

28:03.940 --> 28:05.103
That's why I'm here.

28:05.275 --> 28:07.481
I have access
to a primo paper source.

28:07.986 --> 28:11.355
- Let's say I'm interested.
- If I introduce you,

28:11.531 --> 28:14.698
how do I know
I won't end up like Brandon?

28:16.536 --> 28:19.406
You think I killed Valdivia?

28:19.872 --> 28:21.699
I'm just a businessman.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.544
And I'm just a debutante.

28:25.169 --> 28:27.660
I got a partner who's supposed to
come through with the paper.

28:27.839 --> 28:31.706
So far, he hasn't.
That's what got Valdivia so impatient.

28:32.259 --> 28:35.296
Now Valdivia is not with us anymore.

28:39.141 --> 28:40.849
Four-thirty.

28:42.102 --> 28:45.187
Oh, just so you know,

28:45.939 --> 28:48.062
if this goes south,

28:48.233 --> 28:50.854
I will not hesitate to kill you.

28:55.198 --> 28:58.199
What, you wanna frisk me again
before I leave, Rick?

29:01.621 --> 29:02.652
We're in.

29:14.724 --> 29:16.099
I'm Gordon Taymis,

29:16.267 --> 29:21.344
the youngest son of a prominent
Canadian paper-making family.

29:22.731 --> 29:25.353
- Do you think I ought to wear a tie?
- Hmm.

29:25.693 --> 29:27.317
You're disillusioned.

29:27.486 --> 29:28.814
Your father wears a tie.

29:28.988 --> 29:30.980
I thought Canadians
were all supposed to be happy?

29:31.156 --> 29:34.323
Never mistake politeness
for contentment.

29:36.745 --> 29:38.536
What are the three P's?

29:38.705 --> 29:41.279
Let's see. We've got printing press,

29:41.583 --> 29:43.208
- Patent green ink,
- Yeah.

29:43.376 --> 29:45.535
- And paper, of course.
- Ah.

29:46.129 --> 29:51.468
What's the power requirement
for a ten-ton intaglio press?

29:51.634 --> 29:54.256
That's a trick question, Hetty.
It takes at least a 20-ton press

29:54.429 --> 29:56.587
to get the proper raised finish
on authentic paper.

29:56.764 --> 29:59.338
- You're ready, Mr. Callen.
- Thank you.

30:00.810 --> 30:04.095
Take her out to dinner,
after the case is over.

30:05.815 --> 30:07.807
- Agent Giordano?
- Mm.

30:08.526 --> 30:12.773
Then take Sam the next night.
You know how he gets.

30:25.334 --> 30:26.413
Rick.

30:26.585 --> 30:27.996
Gordon.

30:28.170 --> 30:29.747
- How you doing?
- Hey.

30:30.589 --> 30:34.040
I hear you're in the paper industry.

30:34.217 --> 30:36.257
Family business.

30:36.928 --> 30:40.095
- Third generation.
- My old man was a printer.

30:40.265 --> 30:41.759
Ink in the veins.

30:45.436 --> 30:48.640
I'm sorry. This...
This just doesn't feel right.

30:48.815 --> 30:50.357
It's okay, it's okay. Relax.

30:50.525 --> 30:53.146
I'm just used to meeting
in boardrooms, not in bars.

30:53.319 --> 30:54.979
Sit down, sit down. Finish your drink.

31:01.410 --> 31:04.115
I've seen your work.
It's extraordinary.

31:04.288 --> 31:06.993
- Twenty-ton intaglio press?
- Mm-hm.

31:07.750 --> 31:08.864
And I mix my own ink.

31:09.043 --> 31:11.534
1995 series, though.
That's old paper.

31:11.712 --> 31:14.915
Single security strip,
still in circulation.

31:15.090 --> 31:18.755
That's your problem,
you need the right paper to match.

31:18.927 --> 31:20.505
My family company,
we have the contract

31:20.679 --> 31:22.588
with the U.S. Bureau
of Printing and Engraving.

31:22.764 --> 31:25.469
We supply all the cotton
and linen rag.

31:26.393 --> 31:29.263
Yeah, but every single sheet
has to be accounted for.

31:29.437 --> 31:31.181
It does.

31:31.481 --> 31:32.856
I'm the compliance officer.

31:34.609 --> 31:36.483
Really?

31:38.780 --> 31:42.231
So, what?
The family business doesn't pay?

31:44.410 --> 31:49.866
My current level of compensation
is inadequate.

31:50.041 --> 31:54.916
You see, Gordon has a family
and a wife in Vancouver,

31:55.379 --> 31:57.621
and a very good friend in L.A.

32:03.428 --> 32:04.673
How much paper do you need?

32:04.846 --> 32:07.219
A three-foot stack should do it.

32:09.810 --> 32:12.301
That's 2000 sheets.

32:13.563 --> 32:15.105
That's $20 million.

32:15.273 --> 32:16.471
Can't handle it?

32:17.317 --> 32:19.523
How are you gonna move
$20 million?

32:20.487 --> 32:25.148
Oh, I got a window once every 90 days
where we can unload all we print.

32:25.325 --> 32:27.994
- At par, guaranteed.
- Par?

32:28.578 --> 32:30.451
A hundred cents on the dollar?

32:33.791 --> 32:35.333
My cut's 40 percent.

32:35.835 --> 32:41.256
Ha, ha, ha. You get 20 and you
take care of her out of your end.

32:41.424 --> 32:43.997
And I'll need a sample.

32:46.971 --> 32:49.177
The sample is right in front of you.

32:56.563 --> 32:57.974
Son of a...

33:00.067 --> 33:02.355
Pargo said "we." He's got a partner.

33:02.527 --> 33:04.520
Eric couldn't place Pargo or Eddie
on the roof.

33:04.696 --> 33:06.190
Neither of them killed Valdivia.

33:06.364 --> 33:09.235
But if we can deliver the paper,
maybe we can meet the partner.

33:09.409 --> 33:11.734
Nobody gets a hundred cents
on the dollar for counterfeit.

33:11.911 --> 33:13.868
And what is this 90-day window
all about?

33:14.038 --> 33:15.616
Bigger question is:

33:15.790 --> 33:17.948
How do we get 2000 sheets of paper
by tomorrow?

33:18.126 --> 33:19.668
Hey, Callen.

33:24.840 --> 33:28.126
Somebody is clicking through
your backstop website.

33:28.469 --> 33:30.960
"Supplying high-end cotton
and linen products

33:31.138 --> 33:33.463
to only the most discerning customers
worldwide."

33:33.641 --> 33:36.392
- Nice turn of phrase, Eric.
- I minored in Lit.

33:36.560 --> 33:39.596
Okay. So I traced the IP address
back to Rick Pargo.

33:39.772 --> 33:42.725
Oh, he's going deeper now.
I hid a hard-to-read shipping manifest

33:42.900 --> 33:44.726
for the U.S. Bureau
of Printing and Engraving

33:44.902 --> 33:48.068
- in the background of one of the shots.
- So if he clicks on it, he's hooked.

33:48.238 --> 33:49.566
He's downloading the JPEG now.

33:57.539 --> 34:00.160
- Yeah.
- Hey, Gordy. How you doing?

34:00.333 --> 34:02.456
- Hi, Rick.
- Looks like you and me

34:02.627 --> 34:04.370
are going into business.

34:18.726 --> 34:20.101
I need paper.

34:20.603 --> 34:23.473
Look at you, you got in with Pargo.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.271
Is that a double-double?

34:27.443 --> 34:28.522
I missed lunch.

34:28.694 --> 34:29.808
We're sharing, right?

34:37.619 --> 34:39.078
So how much paper do you need?

34:39.579 --> 34:41.572
Two-thousand sheets.

34:44.542 --> 34:45.871
By tomorrow.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.045
That's good.

34:57.180 --> 34:58.804
Testing my wire, Sam.

34:58.973 --> 35:00.348
I got you in my earpiece, G.

35:00.516 --> 35:02.425
We're going in.

35:16.907 --> 35:18.567
Search them.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.667
You're my newfound friend, Gordy,
you know that?

35:26.833 --> 35:28.244
Got the number generator.

35:30.504 --> 35:33.374
- Where's my money?
- Your money will be here in a bit.

35:33.548 --> 35:37.083
In the meantime, we've got work to do.
You are a printer, right?

35:37.260 --> 35:39.632
- Ink's in my veins.
- We'll see. Let's go.

35:39.804 --> 35:41.382
Unload it!

35:51.691 --> 35:52.722
All right.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.476
I'll ink it, you wipe it. That work?

35:55.653 --> 35:57.444
Let's do it.

36:07.664 --> 36:11.994
Just enough to fill the grooves.

36:12.461 --> 36:13.836
The pressure does the rest.

36:14.004 --> 36:15.628
He's a born operator, Dom.

36:24.347 --> 36:25.758
Oh, yeah.

36:25.932 --> 36:28.470
Three seconds, $3000.

36:28.643 --> 36:30.552
There's no feeling like it.

36:33.189 --> 36:35.146
All right, they're printing.
We got all we need.

36:35.316 --> 36:38.187
No, you've got all you need.
I'm waiting on one more player.

36:38.361 --> 36:39.903
Yeah, if he ever shows up.

36:40.071 --> 36:42.906
- I'm here to catch a counterfeiter.
- I'm trying to catch a murderer.

36:43.074 --> 36:45.991
And it's not Pargo,
because he wasn't on the roof.

36:47.620 --> 36:49.577
Already dry.

36:56.170 --> 36:57.878
They're flawless.

37:01.216 --> 37:02.794
Company.

37:03.885 --> 37:05.677
Eyes open, G. It's Gunny Pallet.

37:06.179 --> 37:07.971
He's Pargo's partner.

37:08.140 --> 37:10.595
Unbelievable. All right, I'm going in.

37:10.767 --> 37:13.388
Dom, if the truck leaves,
follow them.

37:13.895 --> 37:16.351
It's all there. Twenty million.

37:17.232 --> 37:18.856
Just like the real thing.

37:19.025 --> 37:20.650
- Yeah.
- It's all in the paper.

37:24.280 --> 37:27.614
I'm sorry, you want your money.
Here you go.

37:33.039 --> 37:34.782
Guys, we had a deal.

37:34.957 --> 37:37.578
Where are you gonna get
your paper next time?

37:38.502 --> 37:41.788
I mean, wait a minute. L...

37:42.298 --> 37:45.298
All right, we can renegotiate.
I mean...

37:45.718 --> 37:46.880
How does 10 percent sound?

37:47.386 --> 37:49.046
It sounds expensive.

37:49.221 --> 37:51.712
Wait until we leave,
then take care of them.

38:01.024 --> 38:02.767
Frank!

38:09.240 --> 38:12.526
Get in there! Get in there!
Now, now! Get in! Let's go!

38:33.305 --> 38:34.799
I told you I'd kill you.

38:34.974 --> 38:36.468
Pargo.

38:37.643 --> 38:39.185
It's over.

38:39.353 --> 38:40.551
Eddie!

38:40.729 --> 38:42.057
Eddie's taking a nap.

38:43.649 --> 38:44.811
Kensi?

38:53.033 --> 38:54.610
Turn over.

38:54.784 --> 38:57.073
- Dom?
- Following the money.

38:58.746 --> 39:01.119
Callen.
Pallet's back at Camp Pendleton.

39:01.291 --> 39:03.082
And the counterfeit money's
still on board.

39:03.251 --> 39:05.125
- We're on our way.
- You've got $20 million

39:05.294 --> 39:07.620
in counterfeit hundreds.
Why go back to the loading dock?

39:07.797 --> 39:09.754
Because you're gonna
ship something.

39:09.924 --> 39:12.082
Eric, give me a list of all flights
leaving Pendleton

39:12.260 --> 39:14.169
in the next four hours
and what's on them.

39:14.345 --> 39:16.421
Sending the manifest to you now,
Sam.

39:18.766 --> 39:20.094
We got payrolls in Afghanistan,

39:20.267 --> 39:22.343
embassy ATMs
all over the Middle East and Asia.

39:22.519 --> 39:24.845
Twenty million in cash
flying out tonight.

39:25.022 --> 39:27.857
Pallet just printed 20 mil
and he's swapping it for the real thing.

39:28.025 --> 39:29.436
We should be in on that swap.

39:29.610 --> 39:32.361
Tell Hetty we need to intercept
the real money.

39:32.779 --> 39:34.902
The plane leaves in two hours, G.

39:36.825 --> 39:38.652
Standby. The game is in play.

39:38.827 --> 39:40.618
Armoured truck on its way in.

39:44.124 --> 39:46.745
Get that pallet unloaded.

39:48.336 --> 39:50.792
You need to sign
for this money, sergeant.

39:53.591 --> 39:54.754
Signed and sealed, corporal.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.337
- On your way.
- Aye, aye, gunny.

39:56.511 --> 39:59.511
Hello! That pallet on the right
goes on the aircraft.

39:59.680 --> 40:02.302
- Your right, not my right, brain-dead!
- Yes, sergeant!

40:02.475 --> 40:04.302
Let's move it!

40:07.855 --> 40:09.515
Let's go, lollygags.

40:09.690 --> 40:12.228
We've got aircraft
going OCONUS at 1800.

40:12.401 --> 40:14.109
Now, move!

40:15.446 --> 40:18.446
That aircraft ain't gonna wait for us.

40:20.117 --> 40:24.066
That's going 8000 miles.
Get it secure.

40:26.248 --> 40:27.790
Move!

40:55.484 --> 40:57.477
What the hell?

41:01.907 --> 41:03.318
Sorry to disappoint you, gunny.

41:04.159 --> 41:08.453
A C-130 with your fake
20 million has been turned around.

41:08.622 --> 41:09.997
What happened to almost, gunny?

41:14.127 --> 41:17.543
The federal government
prints 20 million every hour.

41:17.714 --> 41:19.173
And for what?

41:19.341 --> 41:22.295
Two more wars
that civilians won't let us win?

41:22.469 --> 41:23.714
That's how you justify it?

41:24.804 --> 41:27.176
I wouldn't do that if I was you,
gunny.

41:27.724 --> 41:30.511
You tell me
that it's the same Navy now

41:30.685 --> 41:32.428
that you enlisted in, chief.

41:32.937 --> 41:36.721
I can't say it is,
but they still ask the same of us.

41:36.899 --> 41:38.892
And that was always
good enough for me.

41:39.402 --> 41:41.062
Not for me.

41:41.237 --> 41:42.399
Not anymore.

41:44.865 --> 41:46.276
Don't do it, gunny.

41:47.201 --> 41:48.779
Don't move.

41:52.039 --> 41:54.956
Part of Pallet's job
was shipping $20 million overseas

41:55.125 --> 41:57.960
every three months,
so he decided to make a switch.

41:58.128 --> 42:00.251
Valdivia's mistake
was spending it too soon.

42:00.422 --> 42:02.664
Messed up Pallet's plans,
so he threw him off the roof.

42:02.841 --> 42:05.047
Yeah, just leaving. On my way.

42:07.512 --> 42:09.421
Born operator?

42:10.140 --> 42:11.967
He's growing on me.

42:13.059 --> 42:14.435
Mr. Callen?

42:15.395 --> 42:16.557
Hetty.

42:16.730 --> 42:22.150
While congratulations are in order,
there is one small loose end.

42:22.318 --> 42:23.433
The money?

42:24.028 --> 42:25.736
The money.

42:27.865 --> 42:31.400
Today, Mr. Callen.

42:32.078 --> 42:35.696
Strangely,
the Treasury wants its money back.

42:37.792 --> 42:40.745
- Done.
- You don't wanna count it?

42:43.339 --> 42:48.878
So do you wanna go get a hamburger?
Or we could order room service?

42:50.262 --> 42:54.722
I've got this rule about dating cops.

42:55.600 --> 42:58.886
So you mean
I have to wait till I retire?

42:59.062 --> 43:00.971
I guess.

43:01.147 --> 43:03.817
Well, I'll put it in my calendar.

43:08.738 --> 43:10.778
Maybe you could take
early retirement?

43:11.741 --> 43:13.734
Maybe I will.

43:15.328 --> 43:16.988
She must have been some cop.

43:20.708 --> 43:22.582
She was.
