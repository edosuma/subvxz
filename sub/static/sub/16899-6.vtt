WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:05.689
Eugene!

00:05.740 --> 00:06.434
Surprise, Ma.

00:06.480 --> 00:07.868
Were you discharged?

00:07.920 --> 00:10.081
Ace Gunner promoted
to Sergeant.

00:10.140 --> 00:12.267
First leave, then
a war bond tour.

00:13.700 --> 00:15.349
What do you think
your doing?

00:15.400 --> 00:18.528
The message is simple,
stay away from my son.

00:18.580 --> 00:22.698
It's not the dying that I'm
afraid of it's the killing.

00:22.760 --> 00:25.058
I'm sorry to hear
about you and Betty.

00:25.110 --> 00:30.230
Ivan asked me to go out
with him but I won't if you
don't want me to.

00:30.290 --> 00:32.281
You could do alot worse.Okay then.

00:32.330 --> 00:37.108
Gene! Stop please!

00:37.160 --> 00:38.855
That was close!

00:38.900 --> 00:42.336
Your heart beating like
that, that's what it
feels like to fly.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.553
When James comes back home
to you, he'll know.

00:45.610 --> 00:48.170
And it like cut through
him like shrapenl.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.476
Broadcasting live from
Victory Munitions,

00:51.520 --> 00:53.260
it's the Freedom Cavalcade,

00:53.310 --> 00:55.562
brought to you by
Witham Foods!

00:57.180 --> 00:59.876
To bring this war to end

00:59.920 --> 01:02.093
We make do and mend

01:02.140 --> 01:06.497
We lend our support
to the crew.

01:06.540 --> 01:09.008
Our boys are fighting hard

01:09.060 --> 01:11.403
While the home-front
stands its guard

01:11.460 --> 01:12.848
At Witham Foods,

01:12.890 --> 01:16.326
We're _with 'em
Just like you!

01:16.380 --> 01:18.507
Sing it like that
on broadcast day;

01:18.550 --> 01:21.246
they'll be running to the
store for baked beans.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.429
I was a little sharp
in the middle.

01:23.470 --> 01:24.596
Close enough for jazz.

01:24.640 --> 01:26.688
But is it close_
enough for radio!

01:26.730 --> 01:28.038
You'll sing great,
trust yourself.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.685
Need a hand?

01:30.740 --> 01:32.696
Yeah thanks.

01:32.740 --> 01:35.607
Boy, you guys are pulling
out all the stops for tomorrow.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.878
Yeah, government's trying to
double the take from the

01:37.920 --> 01:39.308
last bond drive.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.579
Raising funds shouldn't be
heavy- lifting at VicMu,

01:42.620 --> 01:44.793
we're all go-getters.

01:44.840 --> 01:46.319
Hey, Princess!

01:46.360 --> 01:47.748
You see this?

01:47.800 --> 01:50.496
Gene's making time
with DeeDee Burke.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.792
And he called me
a glamourpuss.

01:52.850 --> 01:55.808
You heard from him since he
left on the bond tour?

01:55.850 --> 01:58.637
Nope. It's for the best,
I suppose.

01:58.680 --> 02:00.193
It was just a silly romp.

02:00.250 --> 02:01.581
And your fianc...

02:01.640 --> 02:04.723
Well he's own fun,
that's what I tell myself.

02:04.770 --> 02:07.728
Seems like things are
changing for both of us.

02:07.770 --> 02:09.590
I really don't know
what to do.

02:09.650 --> 02:10.901
How about lending
your muscle?

02:10.950 --> 02:12.906
How big a bond
should I buy?

02:12.950 --> 02:15.908
I tell folks to think hard
about what they can spare

02:15.960 --> 02:17.211
and then double it.

02:17.260 --> 02:19.171
As an added incentive,
VicMu's top contributor

02:19.220 --> 02:20.915
gets this handy spatula set!

02:20.960 --> 02:23.781
And a chance to meet
DeeDee Burke.

02:23.830 --> 02:25.570
Okay. I'll do it.

02:32.230 --> 02:33.754
Is this...

02:33.800 --> 02:35.017
a hundred dollars.

02:35.060 --> 02:36.277
Is that too low?

02:36.330 --> 02:37.627
Princess, you never fail.

02:37.670 --> 02:39.718
You'll be flipping eggs
in no time.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.716
Her hotel room doesn't
have a kitchen.

02:41.770 --> 02:43.897
Well? One thing war
has taught us

02:43.940 --> 02:45.988
a gal can cook
wherever she wants.

02:46.030 --> 02:47.156
You said it, Sister!

02:52.650 --> 02:54.720
They're coming,
they're coming!

02:54.780 --> 02:56.941
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:57.000 --> 02:59.639
here she is, there she is...
Miss Deedee Burke.

02:59.700 --> 03:01.645
Sorry to keep you all waiting.

03:01.700 --> 03:02.598
Introduce me,
you numbskull.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.265
Welcome to our
humble hospital.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.744
Deedee, meet my pipsqueak sis.

03:07.790 --> 03:09.269
I'm weak in the knees.

03:09.310 --> 03:11.961
You were amazing
in Dancer Man.

03:12.010 --> 03:14.149
Can you believe I
haven't even seen it?

03:14.190 --> 03:15.919
Our patients are
excited to meet you,

03:15.970 --> 03:17.972
a Hollywood star
and a War hero.

03:18.020 --> 03:19.976
We'll give them a lift, Doc.

04:06.630 --> 04:07.801
35 cents.

04:07.850 --> 04:10.808
Just off the horn
with the radio folks.

04:10.850 --> 04:11.930
What do you need?

04:11.990 --> 04:14.060
We gotta whoop Ajax.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.987
Freedom Cavalcade broadcast
out there last week

04:17.030 --> 04:19.169
and broke the record
for bond sales.

04:19.210 --> 04:21.121
When Witham's Freedom
Cavalcade comes here,

04:21.170 --> 04:22.512
it'll be one damned humiliation

04:22.560 --> 04:25.347
if they announce from our
yard that Ajax beat us.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.823
Ajax is bigger than us,

04:26.870 --> 04:29.338
how are we supposed to
match their pledges?

04:29.390 --> 04:32.917
Maybe if we had a stunt or
something that screams Vic Mu!

04:32.960 --> 04:36.999
Like what? Setting off a
bomb at the bandstand?

04:37.050 --> 04:37.744
Vera?

04:37.790 --> 04:38.449
Yes?

04:38.490 --> 04:40.310
Think of something!

04:43.840 --> 04:44.659
Good luck.

04:48.150 --> 04:50.675
Some fellows are heading to
the Jewel Box tonight,

04:50.720 --> 04:53.325
thought maybe you and some
girlfriends might want to join?

04:53.380 --> 04:54.449
Sounds like fun...

04:54.510 --> 04:56.319
Aren't we seeing
The Sunset Embargo?

04:56.380 --> 04:57.802
Oh, I've seen it already.

04:57.860 --> 05:00.112
DeeDee Burke is wonderful!

05:00.160 --> 05:01.980
You got your pick
of hens here,

05:02.040 --> 05:04.258
why you gotta go after
my best friend?

05:04.300 --> 05:06.814
What can I say, she
turned my head.

05:06.870 --> 05:10.829
Mess with her heart or put your
hands where she don't want 'em?

05:10.870 --> 05:12.997
I'll kick you so hard
you'll be tasting leather.

05:13.050 --> 05:17.396
I think she's the one that gets
to decide where my hands go.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.742
Mrs. Corbett?

05:24.880 --> 05:28.623
I just wondered if
Gene's back safely?

05:28.670 --> 05:30.535
He's been on a
War Bond Tour,

05:30.590 --> 05:32.626
Still, the way we left it.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.932
You thought you'd
hear from him again.

05:34.980 --> 05:39.064
Sadly, my son makes
a Sherman Tank look
like a tricycle.

05:39.120 --> 05:42.635
I've seen him roll over
many a tender heart.

05:42.690 --> 05:44.681
So you haven't heard
from him either.

05:44.730 --> 05:47.335
Get back to work,
Ms. Witham.

06:01.230 --> 06:02.788
You're out here smoking?

06:05.840 --> 06:08.058
There's a whole ward
waiting for you.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.965
Drooling for DeeDee Burke
not me.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.578
You're wrong.

06:11.630 --> 06:14.019
For weeks I've been telling
those men that my big brother

06:14.060 --> 06:16.881
the "Ace Gunne_r'_' was
coming to VISIt.

06:16.940 --> 06:18.623
They need to know,

06:18.680 --> 06:19.897
how good it's going.

06:19.940 --> 06:22.374
How the work they did,
the price they paid,

06:22.420 --> 06:23.808
it made a difference.

06:23.860 --> 06:25.725
What if it didn't?

06:25.770 --> 06:27.988
You sound just like Dad.

06:28.030 --> 06:29.372
What did you say?

06:29.430 --> 06:31.853
A crusty soldier wants
his every crime excused,

06:31.910 --> 06:33.866
just because he went over.

06:36.090 --> 06:38.126
Stop it. Gene! Don't.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.863
Don't!

07:11.950 --> 07:13.815
Three weeks arrears?

07:13.860 --> 07:16.681
Front Desk? Gladys Witham.

07:16.740 --> 07:19.129
I seem to_ have been
billed in error.

07:19.170 --> 07:22.469
My fianc is overseas...

07:24.260 --> 07:28.003
Well then who has been
making payments?

07:31.010 --> 07:32.705
Thanks for coming, Daddy.

07:34.800 --> 07:36.449
What are we celebrating?

07:36.490 --> 07:38.629
I thought you'd
might like to see

07:38.670 --> 07:41.582
what you've been spending
all your money on.

07:41.630 --> 07:43.803
[Chuckles]

07:43.850 --> 07:45.750
James told you
I've been paying.

07:45.810 --> 07:49.632
Oh no, he kept his
word to you.

07:49.680 --> 07:50.897
Well?

07:50.940 --> 07:53.636
I won't have my daughter
kept by another man.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.988
That "man" is my fianc.

07:56.040 --> 07:58.998
And until you're his wife,

07:59.040 --> 08:02.828
you are my responsibility.

08:02.870 --> 08:05.509
I stopped paying because I
want you to come home.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.128
It will be different now.

08:07.180 --> 08:08.829
Yes.

08:08.870 --> 08:11.134
You'll know you won.

08:11.180 --> 08:15.093
Thanks, Daddy, but I'd
rather pay my own way.

08:15.140 --> 08:20.316
You might find out what
this all costs before
you commit to that.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.055
Cheers.

08:27.980 --> 08:29.629
Betty, the boys will be there,

08:29.680 --> 08:31.500
it's easier if we're
evenly matched.

08:31.550 --> 08:33.506
You make it sound
like a dogfight.

08:33.550 --> 08:34.539
Well? Isn't it?

08:34.600 --> 08:35.635
Men!

08:35.680 --> 08:37.500
Princess! My point exactly.

08:37.560 --> 08:39.505
Moira's on the phone
in the hallway

08:39.560 --> 08:41.425
and I booked a
person-to-person with James.

08:41.470 --> 08:44.337
Except... Moira actually
lives here.

08:44.390 --> 08:47.086
My hotel won't let me
incur any more charges.

08:47.130 --> 08:48.904
Sounds like someone's
overdrawn.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.178
Could I get an advance
on my next paycheque?

08:51.220 --> 08:52.471
Not a chance.

08:52.530 --> 08:55.351
What about that War Bond
money I forked over,

08:55.400 --> 08:56.742
can I get that back?

08:56.790 --> 08:57.916
Yeah of course.

08:57.970 --> 08:58.834
Thank heavens --

08:58.880 --> 09:00.871
When the war's over.

09:03.490 --> 09:05.924
She really needs to
get off that phone.

09:05.980 --> 09:09.802
This is starting to
sound serious.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.977
It is.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.325
Aren't you making a mountain
out of a molehill?

09:16.380 --> 09:18.541
You people treat
sick folk all day.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.942
Everyone looks ill to you.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.890
Mom, someone who burns
himself with a cigarette?

09:21.950 --> 09:23.941
Your son has
combat fatigue.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.992
He's shown a short
temper, hurts himself...

09:26.040 --> 09:28.349
I heard he crashed a car?

09:28.390 --> 09:31.564
The car slipped
into a ditch.

09:31.610 --> 09:32.690
Honestly Shelia,

09:32.740 --> 09:34.788
if word got out, Gene could
be demoted.

09:34.830 --> 09:36.912
And if he goes back,
Mrs. Corbett,

09:36.960 --> 09:40.782
he's a danger to others.

09:40.840 --> 09:44.094
Your son's faced more than his
share of fear, awful things.

09:44.140 --> 09:47.485
Now he can't feel alive unless
his heart's in his throat.

09:47.540 --> 09:52.580
He could get himself killed
if we don't do something.

09:52.630 --> 09:55.679
What, then?

09:55.720 --> 09:59.713
We've had success with
medically-induced sleep.

09:59.770 --> 10:00.805
For how long?

10:00.860 --> 10:03.158
Few weeks, maybe a month.

10:03.210 --> 10:05.678
You want to knock my
son out for a month?

10:05.730 --> 10:07.641
Just_ so that his
brain can rest.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.999
We've seen some great
results with this procedure.

10:10.040 --> 10:11.905
The patient is well
taken care of,

10:11.950 --> 10:13.349
totally at ease.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.472
He'll be resting comfortably,
feed intravenously;

10:15.520 --> 10:17.909
a pleasant time away
from life's struggles.

10:17.960 --> 10:22.351
It may seem like a strange
course of therapy...

10:27.010 --> 10:28.796
Don't be mad.

10:28.840 --> 10:30.922
You know how impossible it is
to tell your father "no."

10:30.970 --> 10:34.144
And how hard it's been for
me to break free from him.

10:34.190 --> 10:36.363
I'll make good,
I'll wire you the money.

10:36.410 --> 10:38.674
Don't bother, I won't cash it.

10:38.720 --> 10:39.971
You're being ridiculous.

10:40.030 --> 10:43.158
Gladys I'm your fianc.
I'll support you.

10:48.730 --> 10:49.981
Gladys?

10:50.040 --> 10:52.258
Are you there?

10:52.300 --> 10:56.259
I'm not strong, James.

10:56.300 --> 10:58.382
I haven't done right by you.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.919
Gladys, let's not...

10:59.960 --> 11:01.655
You deserve to know.

11:01.700 --> 11:04.009
Please let try to
say this, James,

11:04.050 --> 11:05.608
this is difficult.

11:05.660 --> 11:09.039
You won't be coming back
to the same girl you
left behind.

11:09.100 --> 11:10.180
Gladys, please.

11:10.230 --> 11:12.573
They started manoeuvres
in the South.

11:12.620 --> 11:14.053
What are you talking about?

11:14.100 --> 11:16.011
We've gathered enough
troops in England.

11:16.060 --> 11:17.049
It may happen soon.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.361
What will?

11:18.410 --> 11:19.798
We're headed for the
front line.

11:19.850 --> 11:21.670
Maybe North Africa,
maybe even France...

11:21.720 --> 11:23.108
it's an open secret.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.969
This may be our last
chance to talk...

11:25.030 --> 11:29.069
before the war's finally done.
So, please.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.554
It's going to be okay, James.

11:31.600 --> 11:34.114
It means the world,
you saying that.

11:34.170 --> 11:35.853
There's more I want to say.

11:35.910 --> 11:37.992
You have to let me say it.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.348
[Sound of bombs]

11:39.390 --> 11:40.550
James?

11:40.610 --> 11:43.306
Just a Stuka rattling
ourcage.

11:43.350 --> 11:44.908
You'll be careful, yes?

11:44.960 --> 11:46.177
I love you, Gladys.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.745
I love you too.

11:48.790 --> 11:55.138
[Sirens]

12:06.720 --> 12:07.971
Fireworks will make a splash
for the bond drive.

12:08.030 --> 12:09.099
Fireworks?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.764
We'd pack the Cavalcade
if we got some,

12:10.810 --> 12:12.858
they're such a rare
treat nowadays.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.765
Yeah. Not a
"booming" busmess.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.333
Hardy har.

12:16.380 --> 12:19.725
Ever since I went to visit my
dad in the internment camp

12:19.780 --> 12:22.419
the police have been
giving me a hard time.

12:22.480 --> 12:23.868
Marco, there's nothing illegal,

12:23.910 --> 12:25.992
about a man buying fireworks
during his off-hours.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.476
I know. It's just, they got
me chasing my own tail.

12:29.530 --> 12:30.087
Sorry.

12:32.530 --> 12:34.782
There's one place,

12:34.840 --> 12:36.967
Vinzo D_iCarlo's_son
Frankie runs it.

12:40.450 --> 12:42.099
I suppose I could ask him.

12:42.150 --> 12:44.926
Great. If we can't
show 'em a bomb-blast,

12:44.980 --> 12:48.063
at least we can fire
off some rockets.

12:48.110 --> 12:51.022
Wow, look who's doing
that right now.

13:23.710 --> 13:26.577
How goes the War Bond drive?

13:26.630 --> 13:28.848
Pulling out all the stops.

13:28.890 --> 13:31.495
Looks like you're
pulling yours back in.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.714
We used to date.

13:34.770 --> 13:36.101
Him or her?

13:36.160 --> 13:39.857
Him of course!

13:39.900 --> 13:41.982
Kate's a friend.

13:42.030 --> 13:43.941
The way I see it,
life's short.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.163
Why not make it
a happy one?

13:46.210 --> 13:48.166
I've got a great life.

13:48.210 --> 13:51.429
Could it get any better?

13:58.220 --> 14:01.098
Good luck getting
your pledges.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.227
I saw the new Hally at
Downsview yesterday.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.056
She's a beaut! Hitler
won't know what hit him.

14:12.110 --> 14:13.589
Four 303's in the tail!

14:13.630 --> 14:16.281
With these babies, the
war'll be over in not time...

14:16.330 --> 14:20.938
What happened to your hand?

14:20.990 --> 14:23.595
Awww... I cut it on
a bottle cap.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.768
Eugene, that's a lie.

14:26.820 --> 14:28.640
What'd Sheila say?

14:28.690 --> 14:29.987
Bloody little snitch.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.907
She's worried about you.
So am I.

14:32.950 --> 14:36.078
Two years I been gone, I can't
let off a little steam?

14:36.130 --> 14:38.121
You got drunk out of your mind,

14:38.180 --> 14:40.341
played a stupid game
of chicken?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.879
Nearly killed a girl.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.046
Aww.

14:43.090 --> 14:45.968
What... is in you,

14:46.010 --> 14:48.001
it's not normal.

14:53.500 --> 14:57.493
Who says I'm normal?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.144
I kill people, Ma,

14:59.200 --> 15:02.715
I look through the dark at a
man's face and shoot him dead.

15:02.770 --> 15:05.284
So if I want to whoop
it up to forget?

15:05.330 --> 15:08.072
I damn well will.

15:08.120 --> 15:11.556
There's doctors, they have
treatments...

15:11.600 --> 15:13.989
I already got one.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.257
It's called going back.

15:15.300 --> 15:17.643
I'll see ya when
the war is over.

15:17.690 --> 15:18.384
Gene!

15:35.100 --> 15:37.056
Hey, Moretti.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.101
I was just
looking for you.

15:39.150 --> 15:41.141
Haven't seen you
in awhile.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.009
Keeping a low profile
these days.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.025
It's called being Italian.

15:44.070 --> 15:45.150
You and me both.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.156
At least you scored
a steady job.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.760
Hey, Frankie, I've been
looking for some fireworks

15:49.810 --> 15:51.539
for the Witham's
Freedom Cavalcade.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.591
Trying to impress King
and Country now?

15:53.640 --> 15:56.814
I can get DiCarlo's a mention
or two on the radio.

15:56.860 --> 15:58.771
If you could put together
something special.

15:58.820 --> 16:01.288
You got a load of TNT at
your factory,

16:01.350 --> 16:02.567
what's wrong with that?

16:02.610 --> 16:04.043
Doesn't quite do the trick.

16:04.090 --> 16:05.739
I understand you
can't help me.

16:05.790 --> 16:07.655
How's your Pa?
His bronchitis?

16:07.700 --> 16:09.179
How'd you know about that?

16:09.220 --> 16:10.699
Just...word got out I guess.

16:10.750 --> 16:13.002
He shouldn't even be in there.

16:13.050 --> 16:15.666
He got a raw deal,
your old man.

16:15.710 --> 16:17.792
Someone told some
stupid lies.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.148
Yeah. Well,

16:19.190 --> 16:21.010
I ever hear anyone dishing
dirt on your family,

16:21.060 --> 16:23.881
I'll let you know.

16:23.930 --> 16:26.012
Hey, Moretti!

16:26.070 --> 16:28.106
I'll get you the fireworks.

16:30.940 --> 16:35.639
I will pay the bill, sir, it
just won't happen overnight.

16:35.690 --> 16:39.945
What do you want me to do,
hawk my jewelry?

16:48.440 --> 16:51.170
[Knock at the door]

16:51.220 --> 16:53.211
I tell you it's like blood...

16:53.270 --> 16:54.919
Mine's boiling already.

17:00.710 --> 17:04.009
Well look who thinks he
can waltz right in.

17:06.280 --> 17:08.362
You gonna model
these for me tonight?

17:08.410 --> 17:09.195
No!

17:12.200 --> 17:14.509
I spoke to James,
I'll have you know.

17:14.550 --> 17:17.018
Yeah?

17:17.070 --> 17:19.026
Whatcha tell him?

17:19.080 --> 17:21.378
Nothing.

17:21.430 --> 17:23.421
Good call.

17:23.470 --> 17:27.076
_ He's afraid the Allies
might open up a new front.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.031
I'll show you a new front.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.217
Are you even
listening to me?

17:32.260 --> 17:35.081
You don't make it easy.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.085
I couldn't be honest with him.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.096
And now he's going into battle.

17:39.140 --> 17:40.869
Listen.

17:40.920 --> 17:44.185
Your guy doesn't want
to hear about me,

17:44.230 --> 17:47.961
and I sure as heck don't
wanna hear about him.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.236
I...can't.

17:57.420 --> 17:59.672
I just need a litte holding.

17:59.730 --> 18:02.198
Okay, I can do that.

18:03.470 --> 18:04.949
Rita Hayworth.

18:04.990 --> 18:06.981
Can you believe it, that's
who Ivan said I looked like.

18:07.040 --> 18:09.508
I need to get myself
some new needles.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.994
He's such a great dancer,
so confident.

18:12.040 --> 18:15.168
Almost made me feel like I
knew what I was doing.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.563
Did you two ever jitterbug?

18:17.610 --> 18:18.918
No.

18:22.970 --> 18:24.835
Come here.

18:24.880 --> 18:29.965
So first you face your partner,
then take their hands,

18:30.020 --> 18:31.669
right foot, step.

18:31.710 --> 18:32.881
Side.

18:32.930 --> 18:34.841
Back step.

18:34.890 --> 18:36.619
Side.

18:36.680 --> 18:37.453
Back step.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.285
That's good!

18:40.200 --> 18:48.505
[Humming]

18:50.820 --> 18:52.128
I can't do this anymore.

18:52.170 --> 18:53.387
You were doing great!

18:53.430 --> 18:56.160
It's not what I mean
and you know it.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.994
Is it Ivan?

18:58.040 --> 18:59.860
You still have
feelings for him...

18:59.920 --> 19:01.820
Of course I don't!

19:01.870 --> 19:04.873
Damn it, Kate.
You're not idiot.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.229
Betty don't, things
are going so well.

19:07.270 --> 19:08.965
For you, yeah.

19:09.010 --> 19:10.534
You got all you want.

19:10.580 --> 19:15.404
A boy who's falling for
and a girl who already has.

19:15.450 --> 19:21.286
You've used this...
you used me.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.410
That's not true.

19:22.460 --> 19:24.542
I helped you make a
whole new life.

19:24.590 --> 19:26.194
And what are you doing?

19:26.250 --> 19:27.239
I'm living it, Betty.

19:27.290 --> 19:28.803
There's nothing
wrong with that.

19:33.170 --> 19:35.775
Then you ﬁnd someone
else to dance with.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.347
Woman's Quarterly?

19:46.400 --> 19:49.267
Great romances, but not
for the young girls.

19:49.310 --> 19:51.221
I'd only stock a couple dozen.

19:51.270 --> 19:53.056
Got it.

19:53.100 --> 19:56.228
What about Ladies' Monthly?
Ugh.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.668
The recipes are awful.

19:57.710 --> 20:00.144
Remember that breaded
ham hock I cooked up?

20:00.190 --> 20:02.533
Enough said.

20:02.590 --> 20:05.320
Got all these_
women's magazmes.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.191
Who'd'a thought there was
so much to say about

20:08.250 --> 20:11.151
"Ways to Cheer Your
Fighting Boy."

20:11.210 --> 20:14.247
Hey, hey, bad choice
of words, c'mon Lorna,

20:14.300 --> 20:16.200
you got caught in the
boy's cross-hairs.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.298
Don't let him get to you.

20:20.520 --> 20:23.296
I called his officer.

20:23.350 --> 20:24.692
Lorna.

20:24.740 --> 20:28.210
Something's wrong and I
don't know how to reach him.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.397
We'd call it "soldier's heart."

20:30.440 --> 20:32.567
He's carrying more
than he can handle

20:32.620 --> 20:35.259
but he's got nobody
he can admit it to.

20:35.320 --> 20:40.223
I can't stand by
and do nothing.

20:40.280 --> 20:43.272
I'll talk to him,

20:43.320 --> 20:47.199
fighter to fighter.

20:49.900 --> 20:54.416
Come on folks, lets shake a
leg or we'll never be ready
for show time.

20:58.770 --> 21:01.728
Well things are looking
pretty good for the
Cavalcade today.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.554
How's it going with
your pledges?

21:03.610 --> 21:04.508
Need help?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.209
Sure.

21:06.260 --> 21:10.299
You can help fold
these forms.

21:10.350 --> 21:12.818
Looks like we'll be in
for a good turn-out.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.702
Fireworks, starlet,
and a war hero.

21:16.750 --> 21:19.355
I see your friend
is performing.

21:19.400 --> 21:21.004
Kate?

21:21.060 --> 21:24.052
She's singing a jingle,
part of the Witham Trio.

21:24.100 --> 21:26.273
That's not why I'm here.

21:26.320 --> 21:28.276
Got a thing for folding forms?

21:30.890 --> 21:34.417
Doing my bit for the war effort.

21:34.460 --> 21:41.150
Well, you ask me, this
war's given us more than
we could dream of.

21:41.210 --> 21:43.246
Now we fit right in.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.337
For once we don't stick
out like a sore thumb.

21:56.010 --> 21:57.784
Shipping out soon, Dad.

21:57.830 --> 22:00.355
Despite Mom's best efforts.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.789
Did you tell them what's
going on in there?

22:02.840 --> 22:03.704
Why?

22:03.750 --> 22:06.310
You never did.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.703
Sit down.

22:13.110 --> 22:16.898
One time in the trenches

22:16.940 --> 22:21.377
we'd been up to our
armpits in mud for days.

22:21.420 --> 22:24.765
Finally my buddy Billy Ford and
me, we went over the top.

22:24.820 --> 22:27.380
Straight into fire.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.331
Shrapnel got Billy's throat.

22:30.390 --> 22:34.645
I tried to help him
but what can you do?

22:34.700 --> 22:40.081
And now I go to bed every night,

22:40.140 --> 22:43.359
I close my eyes and
see my hands

22:43.400 --> 22:47.609
around Billy's throat trying
to stop the bleeding.

22:47.670 --> 22:50.628
Only to see that I've
choked him instead.

22:53.890 --> 22:57.678
Now I see his blood on
my hands every night.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.196
What do you see, son?

23:08.340 --> 23:10.296
Nothing.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.422
Up in my glass bubble?

23:12.470 --> 23:16.213
No mud, no blood.

23:16.260 --> 23:21.436
_You hold men's lives
in your hands, Gene.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.391
You're no good anymore.

23:23.440 --> 23:26.000
You got a customer, Pop.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.868
And I got a show to put on.

23:31.710 --> 23:34.406
Read your own papers, Pop!

23:34.450 --> 23:35.758
I'm an Ace.

23:43.070 --> 23:44.719
Test. 1,2,3.

23:49.510 --> 23:52.980
Working out some
bond drive jitters?

23:53.040 --> 23:54.462
Nice dress.

23:54.520 --> 23:58.991
You're looking good
in your uniform.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.291
Could use a little ironing.

24:00.350 --> 24:01.999
Trying to tame me, Gladys?

24:02.040 --> 24:03.564
You girls are all the same;

24:03.610 --> 24:07.000
you want a wild man then
you want to chain him down.

24:07.050 --> 24:09.484
Gene, you're here,
what, a few more days?

24:09.530 --> 24:11.578
I know that I like
you, that's all.

24:11.620 --> 24:14.009
Do ya? There's someplace
I gotta be.

24:14.060 --> 24:18.440
What is wrong with you?

24:23.070 --> 24:24.753
That was Eugene Corbett.

24:24.810 --> 24:26.323
He's a friend, Father.

24:26.370 --> 24:32.377
And a close one by
the looks of it.

24:32.420 --> 24:35.378
You checked out of the hotel.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.681
I'm staying with friends.

24:36.730 --> 24:41.201
You really think you'll
last a week on your own.

24:41.260 --> 24:43.342
Enjoy your cavalcade, Daddy.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.649
Where you going?
Come on through!

24:52.700 --> 24:54.258
You winning any money here?

24:54.310 --> 24:57.131
I could use some to buy
a War Bond.

25:00.580 --> 25:02.536
Places! Two minutes
to show-time!

25:02.580 --> 25:03.922
Knock them dead people.

25:03.980 --> 25:06.369
It'll be the best darned
jingle they ever heard.

25:06.410 --> 25:07.456
Sure hope so.

25:10.630 --> 25:13.326
Family photo. The Globe and
Mail's doing a spread.

25:13.380 --> 25:15.507
Ace Gunner and
his proud mother,

25:15.550 --> 25:16.767
what could be finer?

25:16.810 --> 25:18.027
Is my hair okay?

25:18.080 --> 25:20.298
Your hair looks great, Ma.
Give us a smile.

25:20.340 --> 25:22.388
I was worried you
wouldn't make it.

25:22.430 --> 25:25.035
Better get behind you, so
you can't stab my back.

25:25.080 --> 25:27.548
My higher-ups told me you
tried to get me discharged.

25:27.610 --> 25:29.566
I thought they should
know what I know.

25:29.610 --> 25:32.955
Which ain't much. I talked my
way out of the whole mess.

25:33.000 --> 25:35.343
Which is more than
you can do here.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.356
Perfect family!

25:37.400 --> 25:39.527
Gene, I was only
trying to help you.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.184
You tried to sabotage me.

25:41.230 --> 25:43.573
I can't stand by
while you fall apart.

25:43.620 --> 25:46.578
I don't fly with
folks I can't trust.

25:46.630 --> 25:48.188
Have a nice war.

25:52.630 --> 25:55.326
Welcome listeners,
here and home!

25:55.370 --> 25:58.931
This is Witham's Freedom
Cavalcade.

25:58.990 --> 26:02.073
Broadcasting live from
outside of Victory Munitions

26:02.120 --> 26:05.817
in beautiful East Toronto.

26:05.860 --> 26:09.739
And now, here is the
President of Witham Foods,

26:09.780 --> 26:12.169
Mister Rollie Witham!

26:12.220 --> 26:14.347
But first the Witham Trio.

26:15.830 --> 26:18.469
To bring this war to end

26:18.530 --> 26:20.430
We make do and mend

26:20.490 --> 26:25.052
We lend our support
to the crew.

26:25.100 --> 26:27.409
Our boys are fighting hard

26:27.450 --> 26:29.839
While the home-front
stands its guard

26:29.890 --> 26:32.188
At Witham Foods,
we're with 'em

26:32.240 --> 26:34.276
Just like you!

26:34.330 --> 26:42.112
[Clapping]

26:42.160 --> 26:44.025
Greetings, Radioland.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.332
This week we're at
Victory Munitions!

26:46.380 --> 26:48.644
[Clapping]

26:48.690 --> 26:51.466
I built Witham Foods being
honest with customers,

26:51.520 --> 26:53.818
and I'm not going to beat
around the bush today.

26:53.870 --> 26:57.340
Freedom costs money,
lots of it.

26:57.390 --> 26:59.085
So buy a War Bond.

26:59.130 --> 27:01.178
The more money we raise today,

27:01.220 --> 27:06.226
the sooner our boys
will come home.

27:06.270 --> 27:09.660
That was great for someone
whose head's not in the game.

27:09.710 --> 27:12.144
Something with your fellow?

27:12.190 --> 27:14.499
It's Betty she has
these feelings.

27:14.540 --> 27:17.145
Yeah, she's very fond
of you.

27:17.200 --> 27:21.808
No. What she feels, is sin.
It says so in the Bible.

27:23.380 --> 27:29.239
The Bible also tells us to stone
a man for working Sundays.

27:29.290 --> 27:33.386
I can tell in my heart
when something's wrong.

27:33.430 --> 27:37.389
If you can't love her
the way she wants,

27:37.430 --> 27:39.773
just love her the way you can.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.480
When I think about sacrifice,

27:46.530 --> 27:49.613
I think about my daughter.

27:49.660 --> 27:52.788
Not only does she build the
bombs that strafe the enemy,

27:52.840 --> 27:55.798
but she's committed
herself to her ﬁanc

27:55.840 --> 27:57.273
fighting overseas.

27:57.320 --> 28:01.324
Lovers investing
in their bond,

28:01.370 --> 28:04.191
deferring easy happiness,

28:04.240 --> 28:06.504
knowing that greater
rewards await.

28:11.550 --> 28:13.552
Three minutes to Miss Burke!

28:13.600 --> 28:16.854
We can't just sit in silence
waiting for her to grace us
with her presence.

28:16.910 --> 28:18.514
We can do a filler act.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.381
Yeah, well Leon unless you're
whipping out a fiddle...

28:21.430 --> 28:23.512
No. But I have a
darned good singer.

28:23.570 --> 28:24.559
That honey?

28:24.610 --> 28:26.475
She sang a jingle.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.784
I'm ready. I promise.
Give me a shot.

28:29.830 --> 28:31.832
Okay.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.745
Sgt. Corbett!

28:33.790 --> 28:35.792
Who's seen this joker?

28:35.840 --> 28:37.182
You rehearsed for this?

28:37.230 --> 28:39.539
Only my whole life.

28:41.670 --> 28:42.887
Gene?

28:48.330 --> 28:49.581
Ladies and gentlemen.

28:49.640 --> 28:54.464
The beautiful and talented
Miss Kate Andrews.

29:04.610 --> 29:09.388
They've asked me out
a hundred times or more

29:09.440 --> 29:14.355
But all I say is
leave me in a gloom

29:14.400 --> 29:19.315
And here I stay within
my lonely room

29:19.360 --> 29:24.798
Cause I don't want
to walk without you

29:29.200 --> 29:31.418
Gene?

29:33.940 --> 29:35.544
A class-act.

29:35.590 --> 29:39.287
I wanted to say I let things go
too far but you beat me to it.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.558
It's not like I broke
a promise here.

29:41.600 --> 29:44.251
No, just onto the next
distraction.

29:44.300 --> 29:47.997
You're the one, dropped
your lily-livered
"officer" for a joy-ride.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.770
James Dunn is more man
than you'll ever be.

29:50.830 --> 29:52.821
And what's he
done to prove it?

29:52.870 --> 29:54.519
What have you done?

29:54.570 --> 29:57.960
A dozen dead Germans and
a hundred hearts shot
down in flames.

29:58.010 --> 29:59.910
You had me fooled.

29:59.970 --> 30:05.613
But you're nothing but
a sad, frightened boy.

30:08.760 --> 30:16.508
Turn off all that sunshine

30:16.550 --> 30:25.595
Oh, Baby, please come back or
you'll break my heart for me

30:25.640 --> 30:31.863
'Cause I don't want
to walk without you

30:31.910 --> 30:36.609
No, siree

30:36.660 --> 30:43.304
[Clapping]

30:43.360 --> 30:47.182
And with that stellar song,
our bond pledges are up to...

30:49.580 --> 30:52.799
Four hundred and fifty dollars!

30:52.850 --> 30:54.408
[Clapping]

30:59.850 --> 31:00.635
Gladys!

31:06.080 --> 31:07.024
Gladys!

31:08.990 --> 31:09.729
Gladys!

31:17.480 --> 31:20.529
Teresa: Glad my shift's over so
I can see your place.

31:20.570 --> 31:23.789
Well, here you got a wall.

31:23.830 --> 31:26.788
Fan, dresser, another wall.

31:26.840 --> 31:28.057
Window.

31:28.100 --> 31:30.352
Wall.

31:30.410 --> 31:32.139
Lamp.

31:32.190 --> 31:37.719
And a picture I've never
actually looked at until
right this moment.

31:37.760 --> 31:42.766
Brush.

31:42.810 --> 31:45.586
And... well... bed.

31:45.640 --> 31:47.983
That's a lot of walls.

31:56.740 --> 32:01.086
Hey, it's okay, we don't
need to do anything here.

32:01.130 --> 32:02.995
No, I want to.

32:11.140 --> 32:13.870
It's just...

32:13.930 --> 32:16.626
how can this
happen so fast?

32:29.680 --> 32:32.729
Seems to me you've
waited a long time.

32:41.690 --> 32:45.046
Our pledges are now up to
five hundred dollars.

32:45.090 --> 32:49.698
Okay, let's thank DiCarlo's
Fireworks for sending us
out with bang!

32:49.750 --> 32:51.433
[Clapping]

32:51.490 --> 32:52.912
And now...

32:52.970 --> 32:56.189
speaking of celestial bodies,

32:56.230 --> 32:59.529
here's the moment I know
I've been waiting for.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.445
Ladies and Gentlemen,

33:01.500 --> 33:06.881
The exquisite, the remarkable
Miss DeeDee Burke!

33:06.940 --> 33:12.583
[Wild cheers]

33:12.640 --> 33:13.857
Hi, everyone!

33:13.900 --> 33:17.461
I have meet so many
soldiers on this tour.

33:17.510 --> 33:22.072
and each and every one of
them has touched me.

33:22.130 --> 33:24.291
[Clapping]

33:36.710 --> 33:38.314
Gene!

33:42.750 --> 33:44.012
Mrs. Corbett?

33:56.680 --> 33:57.590
Yes?

34:01.380 --> 34:02.722
Oh my God!

34:09.430 --> 34:10.909
There he is.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.178
The police, we
should call them.

34:13.220 --> 34:15.859
No. It'll only spook him,
then God knows what.

34:15.920 --> 34:18.229
He does this,
goes somewhere.

34:18.270 --> 34:20.738
Then, Mrs. Corbett,
you bring him back.

34:20.790 --> 34:23.918
I don't... I don't know how.

34:23.970 --> 34:27.406
You're his mother.
Of course you do.

34:27.450 --> 34:32.752
He loves you, more than
anyone else I bet.

34:35.460 --> 34:39.157
Watch your step...
you got it.

34:39.200 --> 34:41.589
Eugene?

34:41.640 --> 34:42.720
It's Ma.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.949
What a view, hey?

34:46.990 --> 34:49.902
Come on, Gene,
let's go.

34:49.950 --> 34:54.512
Gotta go be a hero,
remember Gene?

34:54.570 --> 34:55.434
Gene!

34:58.220 --> 35:00.563
Ma.

35:00.620 --> 35:03.566
They need you, honey.
Down there.

35:06.190 --> 35:08.704
This is where I belong.

35:08.750 --> 35:11.139
High enough to touch
the hand of God!

35:11.190 --> 35:12.532
Gene, don't!

35:12.580 --> 35:15.538
Enough!

35:15.590 --> 35:17.751
You need to be
careful up here.

35:17.810 --> 35:20.802
Things only make
sense when I'm not.

35:20.850 --> 35:24.024
Gene!

35:24.070 --> 35:25.674
The girl's right.

35:25.730 --> 35:27.982
All I'm good for is
shooting things down.

35:28.030 --> 35:30.772
No, that's not true.

35:30.820 --> 35:33.732
I'm a loon, Ma.
That's what you keep telling me.

35:33.780 --> 35:36.681
No. I know you wouldn't
hurt anybody.

35:36.740 --> 35:38.776
I hurt them all the time.

35:41.130 --> 35:42.734
All the time.

35:48.050 --> 35:49.927
Tell him he can go.

35:49.970 --> 35:51.483
No.

35:51.540 --> 35:53.792
Over there maybe he has enough
purpose to keep him going.

35:53.840 --> 35:55.057
What if you're wrong?

35:55.100 --> 35:57.978
Either way, Mrs. Corbett...

35:58.020 --> 36:01.456
you can't hold onto him.

36:03.980 --> 36:07.632
You help the boys too
though, don't you?

36:07.680 --> 36:10.331
Up gunning from the tail?

36:10.380 --> 36:12.291
Help 'em get home safe.

36:12.340 --> 36:14.649
And this mission's almost done.

36:14.690 --> 36:16.294
It's good work.

36:16.340 --> 36:17.648
Come on, Gene.

36:17.690 --> 36:20.739
It's time to land this one.

36:23.260 --> 36:26.218
You promise you'll
let me go back?

36:28.530 --> 36:30.486
I promise.

37:04.390 --> 37:06.176
I'm keeping you
safe too, Ma.

37:07.960 --> 37:10.269
I know you are.

37:10.310 --> 37:11.959
I appreciate it.

37:23.370 --> 37:26.009
I saw Harold Aikins
looking at those

37:26.060 --> 37:28.494
bouquets and spinners
with tears in his eyes.

37:28.550 --> 37:29.710
That felt good.

37:29.760 --> 37:32.843
It was you that made me do it;
thank you.

37:32.900 --> 37:35.539
Hey, you're the one who
put on the show.

37:35.600 --> 37:37.204
You know, Vera.

37:37.250 --> 37:42.859
I'm so tired of towing the line
and feeling second-class.

37:42.910 --> 37:45.299
When am I going to
get my life back?

37:45.350 --> 37:47.864
When the war's over.

37:47.910 --> 37:49.821
I can't wait that long.

37:53.570 --> 37:56.038
It's a good day.

37:56.090 --> 37:58.308
You celebrating tonight?

37:58.360 --> 37:59.782
Maybe.

37:59.840 --> 38:03.219
Off to break some
lonely hearts?

38:03.280 --> 38:05.407
Wouldn't you like to know.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.838
Yes, I would.

38:09.110 --> 38:12.807
Here I was thinking I'd gone
and missed the fireworks.

38:12.850 --> 38:15.842
Oh you soldiers are
fast-talkers.

38:15.900 --> 38:20.075
Don't tell me you
haven't heard it before.

38:20.120 --> 38:21.337
I haven't.

38:23.770 --> 38:25.681
This was my first time.

38:30.520 --> 38:32.647
First time it felt right.

38:35.090 --> 38:36.739
Felt safe.

38:42.580 --> 38:46.129
Now's the time you ask me how
soon before I ship out?

38:48.280 --> 38:50.794
And so? When do you?

38:50.850 --> 38:53.978
I'm heading out on
a bond tour...

38:54.020 --> 38:55.715
but I'll be back.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.936
Don't take this the wrong way,

39:00.990 --> 39:06.940
but I'm not sure I would have
done this with you if I knew I'd
have to see you again.

39:06.990 --> 39:10.903
Is that what you're looking for?

39:10.950 --> 39:16.035
I wasn't looking for anything.

39:16.090 --> 39:18.729
But I'm glad you found me.

39:28.190 --> 39:29.487
I gotta tell you,

39:29.540 --> 39:31.929
seeing you onstage
doing your thing,

39:31.970 --> 39:33.881
was like watching a
whole new person.

39:33.930 --> 39:35.318
How'd you do it?

39:35.370 --> 39:38.589
Helped having the right
folks out there to sing to.

39:38.630 --> 39:40.063
Ready for some
Chinese food?

39:40.110 --> 39:41.930
My favourite.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.113
[Muffled Laughter]

39:51.210 --> 39:52.029
You coming?

39:56.000 --> 39:56.864
You bet.

40:20.060 --> 40:22.494
Could we have some privacy,
please?

40:26.160 --> 40:28.856
You'll want to
keep that on a low heat.

40:33.030 --> 40:36.852
Keep them moving.

40:36.910 --> 40:38.332
Are you staying here now?

40:38.390 --> 40:41.348
For the time being at least.

40:41.390 --> 40:43.779
Gene's gone, I suppose.

40:43.830 --> 40:46.253
Thank you for
helping me with him.

40:46.310 --> 40:52.397
I'm sorry you didn't
get a proper goodbye.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.999
I've lost my taste for
teary farewells.

40:56.060 --> 41:00.497
I'm not here about Gene.

41:00.540 --> 41:02.053
You're not?

41:02.110 --> 41:05.932
Your hotel, you gave them VicMu
as a forwarding address.

41:05.980 --> 41:09.450
And ah...

41:09.510 --> 41:11.501
A telegram.

41:11.550 --> 41:13.461
It may not be bad news.

41:13.510 --> 41:15.683
No soldiers delivering it.

41:15.730 --> 41:17.550
Because James serves
another country.

41:20.210 --> 41:23.338
Thing is, we just spoke.

41:26.440 --> 41:27.919
Oh, do you want me...

41:27.960 --> 41:29.734
No.

41:49.020 --> 41:51.022
I can't.

41:51.070 --> 41:53.971
Will you?

41:54.030 --> 41:55.281
Please, Mrs. Corbett.

42:01.340 --> 42:05.253
"The Secretary of War
desires me to express

42:05.300 --> 42:07.552
his deepest...

42:07.610 --> 42:08.952
regret....

42:09.000 --> 42:09.955
that your fianc...

42:10.000 --> 42:12.082
Lt. James Dunn

42:12.130 --> 42:14.041
was killed during
a bombing raid

42:14.090 --> 42:18.868
in Canterbury England,
June 6 1942.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.048
Please accept our
sincere sympathies

42:22.100 --> 42:26.491
and gratitude for your
fianc's brave service..."

42:30.110 --> 42:31.099
Damn it!

42:33.110 --> 42:34.589
It's okay.

42:37.110 --> 42:40.068
No it's not.

42:55.480 --> 42:57.471
Help me do this right.

43:02.660 --> 43:04.969
Use the fork
kind of like this.

43:05.010 --> 43:09.754
Lift it up.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.052
Perfect good.

43:12.110 --> 43:20.063
Then, I find a little milk
helps, just a dash.

43:20.110 --> 43:22.852
That's good.

43:22.900 --> 43:25.892
And salt and pepper.
