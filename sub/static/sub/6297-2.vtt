<i>The Borgias...</i>

00:02.156 --> 00:04.858
Now is the
time of reckoning.

00:06.160 --> 00:08.762
Our task is of vengeance.

00:08.796 --> 00:10.864
But you must know
by now, Cardinal.

00:10.965 --> 00:13.066
Work with us.

00:13.167 --> 00:14.468
Not against us.

00:14.568 --> 00:15.869
We are family!

00:15.970 --> 00:17.037
We are one!

00:17.071 --> 00:19.172
And we will only
triumph as one!

00:25.613 --> 00:28.615
We will have none of that;
you are brothers, after all.

00:28.683 --> 00:30.584
Is His Holiness
lacking something?

00:30.618 --> 00:34.388
Does my presence
no longer fill him with joy?

00:35.990 --> 00:38.292
You're very young, beautiful.

00:38.393 --> 00:42.396
You are more Eve than Adam.

00:42.430 --> 00:46.600
We propose a celebration for
the entire populace of Rome.

00:46.634 --> 00:47.801
Whatever the cost.

00:47.902 --> 00:51.004
Let Rome be full of joy!

00:51.105 --> 00:52.506
I gave my body to you.

00:52.607 --> 00:54.141
I broke my marriage vows.

00:54.208 --> 00:56.310
You bought those three
weeks with murder.

00:56.411 --> 00:58.211
Admit it, Cardinal.

00:58.246 --> 00:59.846
I will search you out.

00:59.914 --> 01:03.250
You may find a nunnery but
you will never be free of me.

01:03.318 --> 01:05.519
Tell me again, my love.
Who was his father?

01:05.620 --> 01:08.021
A groom, Paolo.

01:08.122 --> 01:09.823
Impossible loves;

01:09.924 --> 01:11.959
they can become an addiction.

01:12.026 --> 01:14.928
You fear for the constancy
of your lover's affections?

01:15.029 --> 01:16.229
Don't do as I did.

01:16.331 --> 01:17.931
Allow him his fancy.

01:18.032 --> 01:20.067
Let him look both ways.

01:20.134 --> 01:22.636
But be sure one of those
gazes falls on you.

Excuse me, old man.

03:08.342 --> 03:09.876
Which way is Rome?

03:09.944 --> 03:13.046
Can you not smell it,
from here?

03:13.147 --> 03:14.548
Does Rome smell?

03:14.582 --> 03:15.749
It stinks.

03:15.783 --> 03:17.350
What do you want in Rome?

03:17.385 --> 03:18.952
I have a child there.

03:18.986 --> 03:21.254
Pity the poor child, then.

03:21.355 --> 03:22.656
Rome.

03:24.358 --> 03:25.959
Good!

04:15.309 --> 04:19.713
We had a dream.

04:22.416 --> 04:28.221
We were a trinity upon
this bed last night.

04:28.322 --> 04:31.858
What if there was no dream?

04:31.926 --> 04:34.227
And we were three indeed.

04:38.633 --> 04:49.242
Was it by our
invitation or by yours?

04:49.343 --> 04:52.646
Our memory is...

04:55.750 --> 05:00.353
I'm afraid it was
I, Your Holiness.

05:10.665 --> 05:13.166
Shall I be whipped
for my offence?

05:16.571 --> 05:19.372
You should be bound and
whipped and ravaged.

05:22.376 --> 05:24.177
When?

05:26.547 --> 05:28.381
Often.

05:52.707 --> 05:54.207
You may leave us, sisters.

05:54.308 --> 05:56.209
Your Eminence.
Your Eminence.

06:04.518 --> 06:06.519
Sister Martha.

06:06.554 --> 06:08.321
Cardinal.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.526
You know what this is?

06:13.561 --> 06:15.128
It is the fresco

06:15.162 --> 06:17.230
you have so graciously
commissioned, Cardinal.

06:17.331 --> 06:18.965
<i>Of the founder of our order.</i>

06:19.033 --> 06:23.136
St. Cecelia, the
patron saint of music.

06:23.170 --> 06:25.405
But it lacks a model.

06:25.439 --> 06:27.374
Which is why I
have asked for you.

06:27.441 --> 06:28.742
I am afraid I cannot.

06:28.843 --> 06:30.577
And I am afraid you must.

06:30.645 --> 06:32.846
I am the Abbey's
benefactor, after all.

06:36.984 --> 06:41.454
St. Cecelia was
renowned for her beauty.

06:41.555 --> 06:45.058
But St. Cecilia was
no nun, Your Eminence.

06:49.263 --> 06:52.365
But if you would
allow me...

06:52.466 --> 06:54.868
You offend me, Cardinal!

06:54.969 --> 06:56.369
Perhaps.

06:56.470 --> 06:58.872
I am sorry for it.

06:58.973 --> 07:01.241
But I would restore this
hair to what it was

07:01.275 --> 07:03.376
before God snatched
it from me.

07:03.411 --> 07:07.247
Cardinal, please.

07:07.281 --> 07:10.250
I know, I know.
I blaspheme.

07:10.284 --> 07:13.987
But it's for
a higher purpose.

07:14.021 --> 07:17.190
Can you restore her hair,
Pinturicchio?

07:17.224 --> 07:18.658
Gladly.

07:18.693 --> 07:20.593
And can you make
those lips live again?

07:24.398 --> 07:26.199
From a throne to
a Judas chair.

07:26.233 --> 07:28.401
Who could
have thought it?

07:28.436 --> 07:30.804
Certainly not Prince Alfonso.

07:30.905 --> 07:33.006
Did you revive him often?

07:33.040 --> 07:37.210
Seven times, through
one long night.

07:37.311 --> 07:40.313
Can you imagine pain, Doctor?

07:40.414 --> 07:44.617
Pain such as this.

07:44.652 --> 07:47.420
I imagine it hurts.

07:47.455 --> 07:51.024
And enough of this sophistry.

07:51.125 --> 07:53.226
Indeed.

07:53.327 --> 07:55.929
To work.

08:03.537 --> 08:06.039
Your Eminence.

08:06.073 --> 08:10.643
You will die, Your Eminence,
if you eat nothing,

08:10.745 --> 08:13.847
drink only rainwater!

08:13.881 --> 08:16.049
I can trust only
the rain, Sister.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.051
We cook our own food!

08:18.085 --> 08:20.053
Who provides the grains?

08:20.087 --> 08:21.287
The meat?

08:21.355 --> 08:23.857
Is there no persuading
the Cardinal?

08:23.958 --> 08:28.561
Perhaps a monkey...

08:28.662 --> 08:31.097
A monkey?

08:31.165 --> 08:34.868
A capuchin monkey.

08:39.106 --> 08:41.674
Some bread sir?

08:44.111 --> 08:48.481
You are looking for a
lady, young handsome man?

08:48.516 --> 08:50.350
How did you know?

08:50.384 --> 08:52.285
I imagine everyone
walking these streets

08:52.386 --> 08:53.987
is looking for a lady.

08:54.088 --> 08:56.022
What's her name?

08:56.090 --> 08:58.591
Come on now.
She must have a name.

08:58.692 --> 09:00.293
Lucrezia.

09:00.327 --> 09:02.595
I know a few Lucrezias!

09:02.696 --> 09:04.898
She is noble, my Lucrezia.

09:04.999 --> 09:07.400
You saying I'm not noble?

09:07.501 --> 09:09.502
I would not be
so bold, my lady.

09:11.705 --> 09:14.507
Your lady?
Right.

09:14.608 --> 09:16.810
I am your lady.

09:16.911 --> 09:20.113
And I'll find you
your Lucrezia.

09:32.626 --> 09:35.929
Can you never rest?

09:44.538 --> 09:47.540
Where do you sleep?

09:47.575 --> 09:49.542
Under silk covers,
last night.

09:49.643 --> 09:54.147
No, on a normal night?

09:54.181 --> 09:56.649
On a straw bed on
a studio floor.

09:56.750 --> 10:00.453
So you know the
streets of Rome?

10:00.554 --> 10:02.155
The slums,
the tenements.

10:02.189 --> 10:04.257
You live among
the common people?

10:04.358 --> 10:05.959
I am one of them,
Your Holiness.

10:08.262 --> 10:13.166
Not for long, I would hazard,
knowing your talents.

10:13.200 --> 10:18.805
Does the Pope of Rome
not know his flock?

10:18.873 --> 10:22.709
You have seen the gilded
cage we live within.

10:22.776 --> 10:26.713
We meet princes and
potentates and prelates.

10:26.780 --> 10:29.582
But very few of
the common people.

10:32.887 --> 10:35.588
We might need
your assistance.

10:40.494 --> 10:42.795
Ah, Cardinal Sforza.

10:42.830 --> 10:45.698
You have come to view our...

10:45.799 --> 10:48.434
Roman treasures?

10:48.502 --> 10:49.936
Etruscan,
I would wager.

10:50.004 --> 10:53.473
Ah, the cardinal is an
expert on such matters.

10:53.507 --> 10:55.208
The cardinal has seen
Donatello's David

10:55.242 --> 10:57.410
and marvelled at the
source of its eros.

10:57.444 --> 10:58.945
Now he knows.

10:59.013 --> 11:01.514
The cardinal thinks there
may be scandal perhaps?

11:01.615 --> 11:04.117
The cardinal does not care.

11:04.218 --> 11:05.718
What the cardinal
does care about

11:05.819 --> 11:07.520
are the
Vatican finances.

11:07.621 --> 11:10.490
Ah, yes.

11:10.524 --> 11:13.426
You will excuse us,
young maestro.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.862
Maestro?
Well, assistant now, but he-

11:15.930 --> 11:17.764
Oy.

11:17.831 --> 11:21.734
This nice young man here
is looking for a Lucrezia.

11:21.835 --> 11:23.836
Do we have any
Lucrezias?

11:23.938 --> 11:25.238
I'll be Lucrezia.

11:25.339 --> 11:26.439
For a consideration.

11:26.540 --> 11:27.840
Her name is Magdelena.

11:27.942 --> 11:29.242
I am Lucrezia.

11:29.276 --> 11:30.643
Oh, shut up, you trollop.

11:30.678 --> 11:32.345
We'll all be Lucrezia for you.

11:32.446 --> 11:34.247
Do we have a second name?

11:34.348 --> 11:35.348
Borgia.

11:36.684 --> 11:38.451
Lucrezia Borgia?

11:38.485 --> 11:40.053
She'd cost more
than a shilling.

11:40.154 --> 11:41.688
You do her a
disservice, my lady.

11:41.755 --> 11:43.856
And I must consider this
conversation to be at an end.

11:43.891 --> 11:45.558
You mean the
pope's daughter?

11:45.659 --> 11:47.260
I'd try the Vatican
if I were you.

11:49.964 --> 11:51.364
The Vatican finances-

11:51.465 --> 11:52.865
Are like Cardinal
Piccolomini's hair.

11:52.967 --> 11:54.067
Getting thin?

11:54.101 --> 11:55.468
Cardinal Piccolomini is bald.

11:55.502 --> 11:57.070
But he had hair once.

11:57.104 --> 11:58.905
And our beloved Vatican
had finances once.

11:58.973 --> 12:00.673
But His Holiness's
celebrations have reduced them

12:00.708 --> 12:02.175
to a state akin to baldness.

12:02.276 --> 12:03.476
But you are the
vice chancellor.

12:03.510 --> 12:05.578
Vatican finances are
your responsibility!

12:05.679 --> 12:07.213
Do something about it!

12:07.281 --> 12:09.816
We have hardly begun our task
for the renewal of Rome.

12:09.883 --> 12:12.285
The restoration of its
historic monuments,

12:12.319 --> 12:14.287
our transformation of
the lives and futures

12:14.321 --> 12:15.888
of its common people.

12:15.923 --> 12:18.024
What does His Holiness know of
the lives of the common people?

12:18.092 --> 12:20.393
I would remind the
Cardinal that unlike him

12:20.494 --> 12:22.495
we were born amongst them.

12:22.529 --> 12:24.597
His Holiness's roots
were in Spain, I believe.

12:24.698 --> 12:26.699
When he came here he was
already a great prelate.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.401
So I would ask him again,

12:28.502 --> 12:30.103
what does he know of the lives
of the common people of Rome?

12:30.137 --> 12:32.305
Well, perhaps the cardinal
would be so kind one evening

12:32.339 --> 12:34.607
as to walk us amongst them?

12:37.945 --> 12:40.313
His Holiness must know
that that is impossible-

12:40.347 --> 12:42.181
for either of us.

12:42.216 --> 12:45.918
As, I'm sorry to say, is
this project of renewal.

12:57.731 --> 13:00.733
Does the monkey
have a name?

13:00.768 --> 13:02.535
Let us call him...

13:02.636 --> 13:04.837
Julius.

13:04.938 --> 13:07.140
Julius Caesar.

13:10.377 --> 13:11.544
Stop.

13:11.645 --> 13:13.379
You mock me, fair lady.

13:13.447 --> 13:15.448
If I did, forgive me...

13:15.549 --> 13:17.350
kind sir.

13:17.384 --> 13:19.452
My name is Paolo.

13:19.553 --> 13:22.855
Beatrice.

13:22.956 --> 13:25.658
I mistook you for a client.

13:25.759 --> 13:27.760
A girl has to work.

13:27.795 --> 13:29.862
Must you so debase yourself?

13:29.963 --> 13:32.465
If I do not lift my
skirts, I'll starve.

13:32.566 --> 13:33.966
Better to starve, surely.

13:34.001 --> 13:36.169
What, like the rest of Rome?

13:36.203 --> 13:37.670
They were fed yesterday.

13:37.771 --> 13:39.205
But today they starve.

13:39.273 --> 13:40.973
But there is such wealth
in evidence here, my lady.

13:41.075 --> 13:42.375
How could anybody starve?

13:42.409 --> 13:43.976
There is wealth, of course.

13:44.011 --> 13:45.778
But we starve.

13:45.813 --> 13:49.582
Whilst Lucrezia Borgia
dines on a silver plate.

13:49.616 --> 13:51.884
With a fork.

13:51.985 --> 13:54.887
You have heard
of a fork, Paolo?

13:54.988 --> 13:56.789
No, my lady.

13:56.824 --> 13:59.025
It is all the rage now.

13:59.093 --> 14:01.394
And I'll bet Lucrezia
Borgia dines with a fork

14:01.495 --> 14:04.030
of solid gold.

14:04.098 --> 14:06.999
Your day of celebration, Holy
Father, was a great success.

14:07.034 --> 14:08.334
Triumph.

14:08.402 --> 14:10.703
The mob does need
bread and circuses.

14:11.839 --> 14:13.005
The mob?

14:13.040 --> 14:14.907
He means the people.

14:15.008 --> 14:16.109
I mean the mob.

14:16.210 --> 14:20.012
But isn't the mob
made up of people?

14:20.114 --> 14:22.048
Is this a riddle, Holy Father?

14:22.116 --> 14:24.450
Well, wouldn't you be
one of them

14:24.518 --> 14:25.852
if you took
away your titles,

14:25.919 --> 14:27.453
Gonfaloniere,
your dukedom,

14:27.521 --> 14:32.825
your linens and your laces-
and your filigree codpiece?

14:32.926 --> 14:35.228
It was a riddle.
A bad one.

14:35.329 --> 14:37.563
Well, riddle me this.

14:37.631 --> 14:42.635
When Adam delved and Eve span,
who was then the gentleman?

14:42.669 --> 14:44.303
There are
distinctions, Father,

14:44.338 --> 14:45.938
in the natural
order of things

14:46.039 --> 14:47.940
between the peasant
and the nobleman.

14:48.041 --> 14:50.910
Between the stallion
and the mule.

14:50.944 --> 14:52.445
Between us and
the common people?

14:52.546 --> 14:53.846
Of course.

14:53.881 --> 14:55.848
But we all have
an eternal soul.

15:01.088 --> 15:02.455
Tell me,

15:04.691 --> 15:06.125
if we were to go
out one evening

15:06.160 --> 15:08.294
amongst the
common people,

15:08.362 --> 15:10.329
which of you, our family,
would guide us?

15:10.364 --> 15:12.064
You would need
protection, Father.

15:12.099 --> 15:13.466
The Pope cannot just
walk amongst that rabble

15:13.567 --> 15:14.667
like one of them.

15:14.768 --> 15:16.269
Why not?
Our Saviour did.

15:16.303 --> 15:18.337
Yes, but he was not the
pope, was he, Father?

15:18.372 --> 15:22.275
You see, it was a riddle,
after all.

15:47.134 --> 15:49.702
Ragazzi.

15:59.613 --> 16:02.815
Be careful.

16:02.916 --> 16:04.717
How can people
live like this?

16:04.818 --> 16:06.319
Because they have
no alternative.

16:09.623 --> 16:12.458
That shoe's worth something!
Let her go!

16:12.526 --> 16:13.926
Fancy shoe...
fancy blade...

16:13.961 --> 16:15.328
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

16:15.429 --> 16:16.829
Who are you?

16:16.930 --> 16:18.731
Alms, alms!

16:20.567 --> 16:22.034
For the love of God!

16:22.135 --> 16:24.237
To feed the infant!

16:26.740 --> 16:28.441
That child is dead.

16:28.542 --> 16:30.843
To bury the infant then!

16:30.944 --> 16:33.646
A grave costs money,
even a pauper's grave!

16:33.747 --> 16:35.348
Come!

16:35.382 --> 16:37.283
Now, sir, sir!

16:37.351 --> 16:40.453
The Roman emperors had their
faults, Your Holiness.

16:40.554 --> 16:42.755
As do we.

16:42.789 --> 16:46.492
But they kept order
on their streets...

16:46.560 --> 16:48.561
and they provided
water for their people.

16:52.566 --> 16:55.701
They built aqueducts,
they provided sanitation.

16:55.769 --> 16:59.272
Yes, and now people
sleep in filth.

16:59.373 --> 17:01.307
Pigeons everywhere.

17:01.375 --> 17:04.410
Where do they come from,
these pigeons?

17:04.478 --> 17:06.012
This was a bath house once,

17:06.079 --> 17:08.881
dedicated to the
Goddess Sulis Minerva.

17:08.982 --> 17:11.851
Now the orphans of Rome make
their bed amongst its ruins.

17:11.885 --> 17:14.686
Among the rats
and the pigeons?

17:14.788 --> 17:17.790
Go on!

17:17.824 --> 17:19.992
Did Rome once
provide for them?

17:20.027 --> 17:21.794
The pigeons?

17:21.828 --> 17:26.065
No, Your Holiness.
The orphans.

17:26.098 --> 17:28.267
There is an entire
branch of the Curia

17:28.301 --> 17:31.537
dedicated to
charitable works.

17:31.605 --> 17:33.306
But its bounty
never reaches them.

17:35.442 --> 17:36.909
Well, we must
see that it does.

17:37.010 --> 17:38.911
Come.

17:43.717 --> 17:44.817
All right.

17:55.262 --> 17:57.730
We will have you,
Giulia Farnese,

17:57.831 --> 18:00.833
go through their
curatorial accounts.

18:00.867 --> 18:02.835
And ensure that
money for the poor

18:02.869 --> 18:04.737
actually reaches
the poor.

18:05.939 --> 18:07.907
<i>Three!</i>

18:07.941 --> 18:10.242
Will I have your
full authority?

18:10.277 --> 18:12.345
You will.

18:12.446 --> 18:15.047
And we shall set
ourselves another task.

18:15.082 --> 18:17.650
To rid this city of its
infestation of pigeons.

18:17.684 --> 18:19.452
<i>More wine!</i>

18:19.486 --> 18:24.256
And then we'll see who will
be the most successful.

18:24.358 --> 18:26.859
Hmm...
Is this a challenge?

18:26.960 --> 18:29.061
A wager.

18:29.162 --> 18:32.264
Which is the greater task,
poverty or pigeons?

18:32.299 --> 18:33.966
<i>Four!</i>

18:34.067 --> 18:39.972
Now we will have two
solidus on number one.

18:43.110 --> 18:45.678
One!
And we win!

18:49.583 --> 18:52.485
You must insist
the cardinal eats.

18:52.586 --> 18:55.087
I will, sister.

18:55.122 --> 18:58.090
He has a terror of food,
since the event.

18:58.125 --> 19:00.893
But if little Julius
here deigns to eat,

19:00.927 --> 19:02.695
the cardinal will
partake too...

19:02.796 --> 19:04.930
I understand.

19:04.998 --> 19:08.167
See him safe to the
monastery in Perugia.

19:08.201 --> 19:10.336
The brothers will arrange
his passage to Rome.

19:10.404 --> 19:12.204
God be with you,
Your Eminence.

19:22.149 --> 19:23.816
Cardinal Versucci.

19:23.917 --> 19:26.619
Your Holiness.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.521
Please.

19:31.324 --> 19:33.526
You have been in charge of
the office of public works

19:33.560 --> 19:35.394
for how many years?

19:35.429 --> 19:37.163
As long as I have been
cardinal, Your Holiness.

19:37.230 --> 19:40.332
Ah.
Two decades, then.

19:40.367 --> 19:44.136
After which time the orphans of
Rome find themselves destitute,

19:44.171 --> 19:47.740
and the cardinal has built
himself how many palaces?

19:47.774 --> 19:49.341
Three.

19:49.376 --> 19:51.343
You see the irony there?

19:53.947 --> 19:57.750
The poor will be always
with us, Your Holiness.

19:57.851 --> 20:00.853
The poor.
Like the pigeons.

20:00.954 --> 20:03.989
I beg your pardon?
Your Holiness.

20:04.057 --> 20:07.760
Does the cardinal believe that
pigeons will be always with us?

20:07.861 --> 20:09.862
Is this a riddle?

20:09.963 --> 20:11.797
We will have
curatorial funds

20:11.865 --> 20:13.833
used for their
declared purposes.

20:13.867 --> 20:16.869
Money destined for the poor
should go to the poor!

20:16.970 --> 20:19.105
So we will have
you go through-

20:19.172 --> 20:21.874
- the last two decades
of your accounts

20:21.975 --> 20:24.276
with one we have designated
to supervise them.

20:24.377 --> 20:26.579
The Lady Giulia Farnese.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.981
What Your Holiness
proposes is unthinkable!

20:29.082 --> 20:30.649
What?

20:30.684 --> 20:32.384
That monies destined for the
poor should go to the poor?

20:32.419 --> 20:36.288
That a woman should have
access to curatorial accounts.

20:39.626 --> 20:43.295
Can a woman not count?
Add, subtract?

20:43.396 --> 20:45.097
Count her children, perhaps.

20:48.602 --> 20:50.836
There is a new method,
Cardinal,

20:50.904 --> 20:53.205
devised by the
Florentine bankers.

20:56.209 --> 21:00.412
It is called double-entry
book keeping.

21:00.447 --> 21:06.752
It proves a valuable tool in
tracing all missing funds.

21:06.820 --> 21:09.622
So, the cardinal shall help
you in your efforts

21:09.656 --> 21:11.824
to source those
missing funds

21:11.858 --> 21:15.060
while we shall attend
to another matter

21:15.128 --> 21:17.630
of what is of
some import.

21:19.432 --> 21:21.433
Your Holiness.

21:21.468 --> 21:24.036
Cardinal.

21:27.741 --> 21:33.145
So, you say a
falcon eats pigeon?

21:33.246 --> 21:37.149
When he can get one,
in his natural habitat,

21:37.250 --> 21:40.052
What is his natural habitat?

21:40.086 --> 21:42.254
The forest of Umbria,
Your Holiness.

21:42.355 --> 21:45.691
Ah.

21:45.759 --> 21:49.762
He should be in
paradise here in Rome.

21:49.863 --> 21:51.664
Think he's hungry now?

21:51.698 --> 21:53.265
Starving, Your Holiness.

21:53.366 --> 21:55.467
Oh.

21:55.502 --> 21:56.869
Well then.

22:09.916 --> 22:12.384
Oh ho ho!
Look it!

22:18.325 --> 22:21.293
You must get me a
battalion of those birds.

23:07.774 --> 23:10.142
These are dangerous
roads, Sister.

23:10.176 --> 23:11.810
I have heard so.

23:11.845 --> 23:13.846
But you have a
precious load there.

23:13.947 --> 23:16.649
Why do you say so, sir?

23:16.750 --> 23:18.951
To keep it so well hidden.

23:18.985 --> 23:20.619
But then...

23:20.654 --> 23:23.155
...you keep your
own beauty hidden.

23:30.964 --> 23:32.364
Hey!

23:41.074 --> 23:43.375
Forgive me, Sister.

23:43.410 --> 23:47.179
Sometimes goodness needs
the help of a little badness.

23:55.021 --> 23:56.989
Lord have mercy.

24:08.435 --> 24:11.036
You can ply your sad trade
upon the Vatican steps?

24:11.104 --> 24:13.238
There's no better
place, my love.

24:13.306 --> 24:16.842
And a cleric's skirt is easier
to lift than a codpiece.

24:16.910 --> 24:19.511
<i>I have spent many profitable</i>
<i>hours beneath them.</i>

24:23.249 --> 24:25.317
<i>Paolo?</i>

24:25.418 --> 24:26.819
<i>Paolo!</i>

24:30.123 --> 24:32.925
However noisome
this Roman air,

24:33.026 --> 24:36.662
the Roman populace deserves
their glimpse of us.

24:36.730 --> 24:39.131
They have a thousand
eyes, the mob,

24:39.232 --> 24:43.702
and those eyes will
be fed, occasionally.

24:43.737 --> 24:45.738
Will you make your wish
at Agatha's fountain?

24:45.839 --> 24:47.306
Yes, Brother.

24:47.340 --> 24:48.941
I would throw a coin in the
waters and say a prayer

24:49.042 --> 24:50.442
for my little Giovanni.

24:50.477 --> 24:53.345
On blessed
Saint Agatha's Day.

24:53.446 --> 24:56.882
I hate Saint Agatha's Day.

24:56.950 --> 24:58.951
Stay close to me.

25:02.255 --> 25:05.657
Go away.

25:05.692 --> 25:15.467
[♪]

25:15.502 --> 25:17.669
Let me hear your wish, Sis.

25:17.704 --> 25:20.305
My wish is for the
fountain's ears alone, Juan.

25:20.373 --> 25:22.975
Make your own.

25:34.788 --> 25:35.988
Narcissus.

25:36.089 --> 25:37.322
Lucrezia.

25:37.390 --> 25:39.691
My God,
what effrontery!

25:39.726 --> 25:42.494
A peasant to a
pope's daughter?

25:44.397 --> 25:46.198
I should colour this
market with your blood!

25:46.299 --> 25:48.400
Let him be!
Let him be!

25:49.502 --> 25:51.003
You know this commoner?

25:51.104 --> 25:52.905
I do not.

25:52.939 --> 25:55.040
Then I will cut out his
impertinent tongue.

25:55.108 --> 25:56.308
Do not ruin this day
for me, dear brother.

25:56.342 --> 25:57.810
Let the commoner
keep his tongue.

25:57.911 --> 26:00.512
He may need it in the future
to explain his impertinence.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.918
There will be more
impertinence?

26:06.019 --> 26:07.519
No, my good lord.

26:07.554 --> 26:09.988
And I beg your lady's
pardon for any offence.

26:10.023 --> 26:11.723
If there is anything I can do
to make good my offence...

26:11.825 --> 26:14.126
There may be.

26:14.160 --> 26:15.527
Then, my lady,
I would hear of it.

26:15.562 --> 26:17.429
Say a prayer
by this fountain.

26:17.530 --> 26:19.731
At midnight.

26:19.766 --> 26:20.933
Midnight.

26:20.967 --> 26:22.401
And beg forgiveness
of St. Agatha.

26:22.435 --> 26:25.437
Now be gone, while you yet
have a tongue to speak with.

26:27.173 --> 26:29.842
I beg pardon, my lord!
Scatter!

26:33.546 --> 26:36.849
Oh, thank you, kind father.

26:40.186 --> 26:43.255
You look happy.

26:43.356 --> 26:45.557
I have seen heaven.

26:45.592 --> 26:47.559
I've seen it too.

26:47.594 --> 26:49.561
From a different angle.

26:50.997 --> 26:52.865
Was your heaven worth it?

26:52.966 --> 26:55.300
Yes.

26:55.368 --> 26:58.170
And if I understood her
rightly, I'll see her again.

26:58.204 --> 26:59.972
Who?

27:00.073 --> 27:01.874
Lucrezia.

27:03.076 --> 27:05.277
My Heaven.

27:05.378 --> 27:07.779
Oh Paolo.
You just made me cry.

27:07.881 --> 27:09.214
Please don't.

27:09.282 --> 27:11.183
Unless they be tears
of happiness, of course.

27:13.086 --> 27:16.588
Just promise me...

27:16.623 --> 27:18.790
you'll be careful, huh?

27:24.397 --> 27:26.598
You have your spies,
do you not?

27:26.699 --> 27:27.900
Who told you that?

27:28.001 --> 27:30.903
A spy, of course.

27:31.004 --> 27:33.605
We would have our ear
to the ground in Naples.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.108
Naples is unhealthy, Father.

27:36.209 --> 27:37.709
So we have heard.

27:37.810 --> 27:39.611
Prince Alfonso is
no longer with us.

27:39.646 --> 27:42.047
That is tragic, indeed.

27:42.115 --> 27:44.416
He would have made a good
match for your sister Lucrezia.

27:44.450 --> 27:46.618
What's a prince
without a kingdom?

27:46.653 --> 27:49.054
It will not always be thus.

27:49.122 --> 27:51.657
King Charles cannot
remain in Naples forever.

27:51.724 --> 27:55.561
Unless he wants to die
of the pestilence himself.

27:55.628 --> 27:59.631
But if he does have plans to
leave that blessed kingdom,

27:59.666 --> 28:02.634
we would be the
first to know of it.

28:05.038 --> 28:07.239
Watch over him this
evening, Nurse.

28:07.340 --> 28:08.440
May I?

28:08.541 --> 28:10.042
Please.

28:12.045 --> 28:14.346
I have business
to attend to.

28:14.447 --> 28:16.048
Certainly, my lady.

28:48.982 --> 28:52.384
Was that was my coin?

28:52.485 --> 28:55.153
How would I know?

28:55.188 --> 29:00.092
Because there was a
wish attached to it.

29:00.126 --> 29:01.893
My Paolo.
Is it really you?

29:01.995 --> 29:03.795
It is nobody else, my lady.

29:05.398 --> 29:06.698
I have missed you so.

29:06.733 --> 29:08.900
As I have missed you.

29:11.504 --> 29:15.807
But you know, my love,
it is impossible.

29:15.908 --> 29:18.510
Impossible.

29:19.912 --> 29:24.516
Have you not yet
read your romances?

29:24.617 --> 29:27.219
I know, I know.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.621
You still cannot read.

29:31.324 --> 29:33.025
It's a bit past her
bedtime, isn't it?

29:33.126 --> 29:35.927
Oh hush, would you.

29:38.965 --> 29:41.233
So why did you come?

29:41.334 --> 29:45.637
To punish me with longing?

29:45.738 --> 29:48.540
I would see my son.

29:48.641 --> 29:50.542
It was a son, was it not?

29:50.643 --> 29:52.744
It was.

29:52.779 --> 29:56.648
A beautiful little boy.

29:56.749 --> 29:59.017
I would see my
boy before I die.

29:59.052 --> 30:02.154
Please, Paolo, do
not mention death.

30:02.188 --> 30:06.191
For you may die,
if you stay in Rome.

30:06.259 --> 30:08.860
Then I will not
stay in Rome.

30:08.961 --> 30:11.229
But if there is any kindness
in your Borgia blood,

30:11.264 --> 30:15.267
you would let me see you
with my son before I leave.

30:18.204 --> 30:21.506
Were you not whipped, Paolo?

30:21.574 --> 30:24.976
My back was at your
husband's mercy.

30:39.625 --> 30:41.893
Oh Lord.

30:41.994 --> 30:44.196
Is that what it is like?

30:44.230 --> 30:46.598
Love?

30:46.632 --> 30:50.202
It must be.

30:50.236 --> 30:52.804
I'll save myself
for business then.

30:52.905 --> 30:54.673
One night.

30:54.707 --> 30:58.210
If you promise me that
you will leave Rome.

30:58.244 --> 31:00.712
Is Rome so deadly?

31:00.813 --> 31:05.450
For innocents like you.

31:05.518 --> 31:09.488
So promise me.

31:09.522 --> 31:14.126
And meet me here
again tomorrow night.

31:14.227 --> 31:16.027
I promise.

31:20.733 --> 31:27.839
Oh, do I hear the rattle of
gold in your pocket, sir?

31:27.874 --> 31:31.276
This coin is
for the fountain.

31:31.344 --> 31:34.312
It would find a
better home here.

31:34.347 --> 31:38.150
Those lovers,
do you know them?

31:38.251 --> 31:42.454
That's the pope's daughter,
Lucrezia Borgia.

31:42.488 --> 31:45.257
To so shame
herself in public?

31:45.358 --> 31:47.259
With whom?

31:52.298 --> 31:55.667
Are you paying, sir?

31:58.971 --> 32:00.572
Some country bumpkin.

32:00.673 --> 32:02.774
Father of her bastard child.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.910
You would earn more
of that gold coin?

32:04.977 --> 32:08.280
Where should we go,
kind sir?

32:08.314 --> 32:10.115
Nowhere.

32:10.183 --> 32:14.686
But I would have that bumpkin
followed day and night.

32:14.720 --> 32:17.589
So I needn't lift
my skirt tonight?

32:18.991 --> 32:23.094
No.
Not tonight.

32:25.131 --> 32:28.200
Is he sleeping, Nurse?

32:28.301 --> 32:31.403
He did miss his mother.

32:31.504 --> 32:32.904
Cesare.

32:32.939 --> 32:35.707
You have a lover, Sis?

32:35.741 --> 32:40.011
No, Brother.

32:40.112 --> 32:41.613
But this child
has a father.

32:41.714 --> 32:43.114
A stable hand.

32:43.149 --> 32:46.017
Who has come to Rome.

32:46.118 --> 32:48.320
Ah.

32:48.354 --> 32:49.921
Unwise.

32:50.022 --> 32:51.423
You disapprove?

32:51.524 --> 32:53.124
Not yet.

32:53.159 --> 32:54.526
But I know those who would.

32:54.627 --> 32:57.963
My father.
Your brother.

32:58.030 --> 33:01.633
My husband whipped him.
My brother would flay him.

33:01.734 --> 33:03.735
Which is why you
go out hooded.

33:03.769 --> 33:07.339
At night.
Like a phantom.

33:11.177 --> 33:15.747
Cesare, he suffered for me
in absolute silence.

33:15.781 --> 33:18.583
He would have
died for me.

33:18.651 --> 33:20.752
The least I can do
is let him see his child.

33:20.786 --> 33:22.754
You loved him, Sis?

33:24.590 --> 33:26.758
I did.

33:29.395 --> 33:31.363
Perhaps I do.

33:36.202 --> 33:38.970
Then you must see him.

33:39.005 --> 33:41.172
You would help me?

33:44.777 --> 33:45.977
Once.

33:46.012 --> 33:47.879
And only once.

33:47.980 --> 33:51.216
Just tell me what to do.

33:51.284 --> 33:52.984
Find us a room.

33:53.019 --> 33:55.186
Where we can spend one night
together away from prying eyes.

33:55.288 --> 33:56.888
One night.

33:56.989 --> 33:58.690
You promise.

33:58.791 --> 34:01.393
I promise.

34:01.427 --> 34:05.697
Go to our mother's house,
tomorrow evening.

34:05.798 --> 34:07.999
She needs to see her
grandchild, does she not?

34:09.435 --> 34:11.703
And?

34:11.804 --> 34:14.205
Leave the rest to me.

34:28.454 --> 34:31.623
You afraid, boy?

34:31.657 --> 34:33.425
I was waiting.

34:33.458 --> 34:34.759
I had hoped for someone...

34:34.827 --> 34:37.027
One a lot prettier
than I, perhaps yes?

34:37.063 --> 34:38.563
Perhaps.

34:38.630 --> 34:40.065
Are you saying that
I'm not pretty?

34:40.132 --> 34:41.933
I have killed for less.

34:44.337 --> 34:47.339
But not tonight.

34:47.440 --> 34:49.741
Come.

34:55.081 --> 34:59.150
You are looking for your love.
Yes?

34:59.251 --> 35:01.252
Then come.

35:08.160 --> 35:11.262
What is your name, boy?
Paolo.

35:12.565 --> 35:16.167
Tell me about love, Paolo.

35:16.268 --> 35:18.370
I know nothing of love.

35:27.713 --> 35:30.215
<i>Should I absent myself?</i>

35:30.282 --> 35:32.884
<i>So my presence</i>
<i>doesn't implicate me?</i>

35:32.985 --> 35:34.919
In what, Mother?

35:34.987 --> 35:39.190
A love that would
displease your father.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.792
Is there such a thing?

35:40.893 --> 35:42.127
No.

35:42.194 --> 35:44.295
Your father is
the pope of love.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.702
But I would keep this
tryst a secret, Mother.

35:50.803 --> 35:52.570
Yes, I am aware.

35:52.605 --> 35:55.907
Affections can be lethal
in this Rome of ours.

36:00.146 --> 36:01.813
He has a right
to see his son.

36:01.914 --> 36:03.214
He does.

36:03.315 --> 36:05.817
But only once.

36:05.918 --> 36:07.218
Come, Mother.

36:07.319 --> 36:09.154
Let us dine together.

36:09.221 --> 36:10.522
Have you dismissed
the servants?

36:10.556 --> 36:12.824
Of course.

36:28.374 --> 36:31.342
Tell me.

36:31.377 --> 36:33.945
Love.

36:33.979 --> 36:38.249
What does it feel like?

36:38.350 --> 36:40.652
It hurts.

36:40.753 --> 36:42.954
Ah, like life.

36:43.055 --> 36:48.660
Yes?

36:52.865 --> 36:55.066
Like Micheletto.

37:30.803 --> 37:34.105
My baby!
Let me hold him.

37:34.206 --> 37:37.609
Does he have a name?
Giovanni.

37:37.643 --> 37:42.547
Giovanni.
Say "Papa."

37:42.615 --> 37:46.417
He's the most beautiful
thing I've yet seen.

37:46.519 --> 37:50.021
I feel sorriest for him.

37:50.055 --> 37:53.124
This needs to be
our secret, Mother.

37:53.225 --> 37:56.027
You know how
I love secrets.

37:58.531 --> 38:02.233
Four noble women, all from
the house of Castille.

38:02.268 --> 38:04.335
So you would
marry me to Spain?

38:04.436 --> 38:09.941
Well, it would be quite
a natural alliance.

38:10.042 --> 38:12.544
And Lucrezia?

38:12.645 --> 38:15.046
Would you marry her again?

38:15.080 --> 38:16.915
In time.

38:16.949 --> 38:19.450
To a nobleman
or a commoner?

38:19.485 --> 38:21.119
What?
A commoner?

38:21.153 --> 38:22.954
Is that wine going
to your head?

38:23.055 --> 38:28.860
Look, stop drinking for a
while and make a choice!

39:02.728 --> 39:05.296
Sister slut.

39:36.562 --> 39:38.429
Fuck off, whoever you are.

39:42.568 --> 39:45.937
<i>What are you,</i>
<i>uh-you're busy tonight?</i>

39:46.038 --> 39:47.138
<i>Huh?</i>

39:47.172 --> 39:48.473
Yes.

39:48.540 --> 39:51.042
But tonight I
keep my skirts on.

39:55.748 --> 39:57.282
Pity.

39:57.349 --> 39:59.150
No pity at all.
It pays better.

39:59.184 --> 40:01.352
What does?

40:01.387 --> 40:04.155
Spying.

40:04.256 --> 40:06.958
Makes a change from fucking.

40:11.764 --> 40:15.366
Spying.

40:15.467 --> 40:16.868
For who?

40:32.284 --> 40:36.387
That gentleman there?

40:36.488 --> 40:38.389
How did you know?

40:38.424 --> 40:40.191
I read your mind.

41:07.820 --> 41:09.220
Were you expecting visitors?

41:09.321 --> 41:11.923
No.

41:26.238 --> 41:28.339
I see you've found
your way home, Brother.

41:28.440 --> 41:30.675
Home.
Like a pigeon.

41:30.743 --> 41:32.443
In your cups you
have forgotten,

41:32.544 --> 41:33.845
your home is no longer here.

41:33.879 --> 41:35.446
I would speak with my mother.

41:35.547 --> 41:36.547
Of what?

41:36.648 --> 41:39.784
Of a peasant from Pesaro.

41:39.852 --> 41:42.653
Who's had his way
with our dear sister

41:42.755 --> 41:44.355
and made his way to Rome.

41:44.456 --> 41:46.457
To what purpose?

41:47.960 --> 41:53.164
If she finds that dog
sniffing around our family,

41:53.265 --> 41:55.666
I would have news of it.

41:55.701 --> 41:57.668
She is sleeping, Juan.

41:57.770 --> 41:59.170
And you are drunk.

41:59.271 --> 42:01.272
Do you really want to
her to see you like this?

42:05.077 --> 42:07.378
Tomorrow then.

42:07.479 --> 42:09.380
Best tomorrow.

42:29.201 --> 42:31.702
Was that an infant crying?

42:31.804 --> 42:35.406
It was from my dovecote.

42:35.507 --> 42:36.908
You loved those doves.

42:36.942 --> 42:38.209
Yes.
And you woke them.

42:38.310 --> 42:39.710
Shame on you.

42:53.525 --> 43:01.265
[♪]

43:01.267 --> 43:08.739
[♪]

43:08.774 --> 43:11.042
Do you love me, Brother?

43:11.143 --> 43:13.144
I would kill for you.

43:13.178 --> 43:15.847
But do you love me?

43:15.948 --> 43:18.282
As I love myself.

43:18.350 --> 43:21.452
Which, these days,
is not a lot.

43:21.553 --> 43:24.255
You are observant.

43:24.356 --> 43:27.058
But you love your family.

43:27.159 --> 43:30.962
And your family name.

43:30.996 --> 43:33.564
Borgia.

43:33.599 --> 43:35.566
Borgia.

43:38.403 --> 43:40.371
He must feed now.

43:40.405 --> 43:41.973
And I must leave.

43:42.007 --> 43:43.574
I wish it were different.

43:43.675 --> 43:45.443
But, yes, you must.

43:45.477 --> 43:49.680
And by the back door,
the back streets.

43:57.990 --> 44:00.291
I would gladly
die for you both.

44:00.392 --> 44:03.895
I know.

44:03.996 --> 44:06.197
So go now, my love.

44:06.231 --> 44:10.201
I would have you live.

44:10.302 --> 44:13.004
I will write.

44:14.306 --> 44:16.507
You know I cannot read.

44:16.608 --> 44:20.211
Well, you must learn then.

45:18.370 --> 45:20.972
Who walks with me?

45:29.314 --> 45:32.083
I mean you no harm, kind sir,
whoever you may be.

45:36.488 --> 45:38.322
Suicide.

45:38.390 --> 45:40.491
A sin even the
pope can't forgive.

45:42.194 --> 45:46.797
Because dead men can't
confess, can they?

46:00.545 --> 46:04.515
Tell your tale
to the river.

46:14.326 --> 46:18.829
Sh, sh.

46:18.930 --> 46:20.831
Yes.

46:20.932 --> 46:22.733
Ah. Sh, sh.

46:25.570 --> 46:29.940
Yes, sh, sh.

46:30.042 --> 46:31.742
Yes.
