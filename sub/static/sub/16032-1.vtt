00:31.947 --> 00:33.615
# Movin' in #

00:33.698 --> 00:36.034
# Makin' my connection #

00:39.037 --> 00:40.205
# Something's up #

00:40.330 --> 00:43.208
# I can feel it in the air #

00:46.378 --> 00:47.546
# Private eyes #

00:47.629 --> 00:50.216
# Never know who's watchin' #

00:53.386 --> 00:54.554
# Play it cool #

00:54.637 --> 00:57.723
# But you haven't got a prayer #

01:00.059 --> 01:01.561
# Have you heard the news #

01:01.561 --> 01:03.729
# Makin' all the headlines #

01:03.729 --> 01:07.233
# Zoomin' via satellite #

01:07.233 --> 01:08.734
# Have you heard the news #

01:08.734 --> 01:10.736
# Comin' through the grapevine #

01:10.736 --> 01:16.242
# Fletch is
workin' overtime #

01:16.325 --> 01:17.785
# Bit by bit #

01:17.785 --> 01:19.537
# One way or another #

01:19.662 --> 01:21.414
# Bit by bit #

01:21.414 --> 01:23.584
# Running undercover
tonight #

01:23.584 --> 01:26.920
# Have you heard the news
Makin' all the headlines #

01:27.004 --> 01:28.422
# Bit by bit #

01:28.422 --> 01:30.424
# Gettin' to the bottom #

01:30.507 --> 01:32.092
# Bit by bit #

01:32.092 --> 01:33.760
# Nothing's gonna
stop him #

01:33.760 --> 01:37.181
# Tonight ##

02:02.957 --> 02:05.043
My name is Erwin Fletcher.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.629
I'm an investigative reporter
for a Los Angeles paper.

02:07.629 --> 02:10.632
You've probably read my stuff
under the byline of Jane Doe.

02:10.715 --> 02:13.134
It's better than Erwin.

02:13.134 --> 02:16.137
Recently I've been
loitering around the beach...

02:16.262 --> 02:19.516
trying to pass for
a minor league junkie.

02:19.641 --> 02:22.143
I don't nod out or drool;
that's too obvious.

02:22.227 --> 02:24.812
Act like you don't care
and you fit right in.

02:24.896 --> 02:27.649
Business has really picked up.

02:27.732 --> 02:29.151
I'm still closed.

02:29.193 --> 02:31.237
Is it a Colombian national holiday?

02:36.075 --> 02:37.743
What do you figure, Sam?

02:37.826 --> 02:39.495
No idea.

02:39.578 --> 02:42.331
- No idea at all?
- Some idea.

02:42.414 --> 02:43.749
Like when?

02:43.832 --> 02:45.876
When it comes, it comes.

02:46.752 --> 02:48.337
I got some reds.

02:49.255 --> 02:51.257
You don't mean communists,
do you?

02:51.340 --> 02:53.843
Is everything a joke
to you, Fletch?

02:53.926 --> 02:55.427
Everything, Sam.

02:57.763 --> 03:00.516
- Hey, Gummy!
- Hey, Fletch. Hey, Sam.

03:00.599 --> 03:02.185
How's the eye?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.354
It's OK.
The cops did it.

03:04.354 --> 03:06.439
They always
beating up on me.

03:26.042 --> 03:28.545
- He doesn't know.
- Son of a bitch!

03:30.213 --> 03:32.215
That's what he said.

03:32.299 --> 03:35.803
He doesn't know?
How come he doesn't know?

03:35.887 --> 03:38.139
I don't know.
He just doesn't know.

03:38.222 --> 03:40.224
Son of a bitch!

03:41.559 --> 03:43.477
I wonder how he
gets the stuff.

03:43.561 --> 03:45.229
I have no idea.

03:45.313 --> 03:47.398
Sam never leaves the beach.

03:47.481 --> 03:50.818
He sits in that chair.
He's out of shit.

03:50.902 --> 03:53.821
Suddenly he gets up,
he's got shit.

03:53.905 --> 03:56.657
Where's it coming from?
The sand?

03:57.658 --> 03:59.744
That's highly unlikely, Grease.

04:00.912 --> 04:03.080
I oughta get some sleep.

04:06.834 --> 04:08.920
Grease, how old are you?

04:09.004 --> 04:10.339
Nineteen.

04:11.673 --> 04:14.259
You're not taking
very good care of yourself.

04:22.017 --> 04:26.355
If you haven't guessed, there's been
a lot of drug traffic on the beach.

04:26.438 --> 04:28.690
I'm not talking about No-Doze.

04:28.774 --> 04:31.902
I talkin' about the hard stuff.
A lot of it.

04:32.945 --> 04:35.948
I've been trying to find out
who's behind it.

04:36.031 --> 04:38.033
It hasn't been easy.

04:38.116 --> 04:40.118
I don't shower much.

04:48.753 --> 04:52.465
Excuse me. I have something
I'd like to discuss with you.

04:52.465 --> 04:55.468
- What's that?
- We can't talk about it here.

04:55.552 --> 04:58.638
- Why not?
- Because we can't.

04:59.806 --> 05:04.143
You on a scavenger hunt, or did I
forget to pay my dinner check?

05:04.227 --> 05:06.646
Come to my house
to talk.

05:06.729 --> 05:08.273
Wrong gal, fella.

05:08.314 --> 05:10.358
I'll give you
$1,000 cash.

05:11.693 --> 05:12.819
What?

05:13.987 --> 05:16.991
Come to my house
and listen to the proposition.

05:19.493 --> 05:22.580
If you reject the proposition,
you keep the thousand...

05:23.414 --> 05:24.957
and your mouth shut.

05:29.003 --> 05:32.006
Does this entail
my dressing up as Little Bo Peep?

05:33.257 --> 05:36.927
- It's nothing of a sexual nature.
- Yeah.

05:37.011 --> 05:39.096
One thousand just to listen?

05:39.180 --> 05:41.765
How can you pass that up,
Mister...

05:41.849 --> 05:44.852
Nugent. Ted Nugent.

05:45.936 --> 05:47.354
Alan Stanwyk.

05:48.439 --> 05:49.941
Alan, charmed.

05:51.860 --> 05:55.363
For an extra grand, I'll let you
take me out to dinner.

06:16.968 --> 06:18.720
What a coincidence.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.639
What?

06:20.722 --> 06:23.392
I almost bought
this place.

06:23.476 --> 06:26.395
Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy
killed himself here. Blew it for me.

06:26.479 --> 06:28.564
- Who?
- Hopalong Cassidy.

06:28.648 --> 06:31.400
Bow and arrow.
Very weird.

06:31.484 --> 06:33.319
Are you doped up?

06:33.402 --> 06:36.405
Don't talk to me like that.
I don't work for you.

06:41.244 --> 06:42.995
- Buenos dias.
- Buenos dias.

06:43.079 --> 06:44.080
Pup 'N' Taco.

06:45.581 --> 06:48.167
Oh, you've remodeled
the garage.

06:48.251 --> 06:50.253
Must have
cost you hundreds.

06:53.089 --> 06:55.174
Good idea.
I oughta frame mine.

06:56.009 --> 06:58.011
Will the Pope
be in later?

07:14.862 --> 07:16.363
Here's my proposition.

07:16.446 --> 07:17.948
I'm all ears.

07:18.031 --> 07:19.950
I want you
to murder me.

07:23.871 --> 07:25.205
Here...

07:25.289 --> 07:26.790
on Thursday.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.044
I'd like you
to shoot me dead.

07:35.466 --> 07:38.219
The reason
I ask for this service...

07:38.303 --> 07:40.889
is because I'm already facing
a very long...

07:40.972 --> 07:44.475
painful and most certain death.

07:44.559 --> 07:47.562
You see, I have bone cancer.

07:47.645 --> 07:51.733
I don't know if you
know about bone cancer.

07:51.816 --> 07:53.902
It's the worst kind you can get.

07:53.985 --> 07:56.988
It just eats you up
bit by bit.

08:02.493 --> 08:04.496
You don't look sick.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.832
I don't feel sick. Not yet.

08:06.916 --> 08:09.501
It'll get bad
in a month.

08:09.585 --> 08:12.588
After that, I'd rather
not be around for it.

08:14.173 --> 08:15.758
Why not try suicide?

08:15.841 --> 08:17.509
I've thought about it.

08:17.593 --> 08:20.763
My company's taken out
a large life insurance policy on me.

08:20.846 --> 08:25.267
Suicide would nullify it,
but murder does not.

08:30.606 --> 08:33.525
- Why me?
- You're a drifter.

08:33.609 --> 08:37.113
A, uh... pardon the expression...
a junkie.

08:37.197 --> 08:39.950
Nobody would notice
if you disappeared.

08:41.034 --> 08:44.203
I've been watching you
for a couple of weeks.

08:44.203 --> 08:46.373
Maybe I'm
just on vacation.

08:46.456 --> 08:49.876
Not with the scum
you hang out with.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.713
No, I've watched...
and I've thought.

08:53.713 --> 08:55.465
It's an elegant plan.

08:55.549 --> 08:57.717
I've even figured out
your escape.

08:57.801 --> 08:59.135
Swell.

09:01.555 --> 09:05.350
Has it ever occurred to you
I might not want to murder you?

09:06.393 --> 09:09.229
I've got $50,000
says you will.

09:09.981 --> 09:12.400
50,000.

09:12.483 --> 09:14.485
And a guarantee you
won't get caught.

09:14.569 --> 09:16.529
I'm still here.

09:17.822 --> 09:19.907
I want it done Thursday
around 8:00 p.m.

09:19.949 --> 09:23.661
My wife will be out,
and it's the staff's night off.

09:24.704 --> 09:26.998
- These will be open.
- Wouldn't they normally be locked?

09:27.081 --> 09:29.792
Sometimes. The staff
usually forgets.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.253
I have the same trouble
with my help.

09:32.295 --> 09:35.590
I'll be here
waiting for you.

09:35.590 --> 09:37.675
The safe will be open.

09:38.926 --> 09:41.762
There will be
$50,000 in it.

09:41.846 --> 09:45.517
You'll be wearing rubber gloves.
Do you own rubber gloves?

09:45.601 --> 09:48.687
I rent 'em. I have
a lease with an option to buy.

09:49.730 --> 09:51.690
Now in this drawer...

09:53.734 --> 09:54.776
Ah!

09:54.818 --> 09:56.278
A.357 Magnum.

09:56.361 --> 09:58.780
My.357. You use it.

09:58.822 --> 10:01.116
No one can trace it to you.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.202
The room will be
in disarray.

10:03.285 --> 10:05.704
Like a burglary attempt?

10:06.705 --> 10:09.875
You come in and catch me
stealing your ties and money?

10:09.958 --> 10:14.880
We scuffle. The gun
gets loose and I shoot you.

10:14.963 --> 10:16.549
Precisely.

10:17.759 --> 10:20.637
- Are you a good shot?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.224
Get me on the first shot,
if you can.

10:24.307 --> 10:27.060
- Do you have a passport?
- Can dig one up.

10:27.143 --> 10:31.439
Good. Now, after you kill me,
take the Jaguar.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.067
The keys will be
in the glove compartment.

10:35.151 --> 10:37.237
- Take it where?
- L.A.X.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.614
Pan Am will have a ticket for you.

10:39.656 --> 10:41.658
- Where am I going?
- Rio.

10:41.741 --> 10:44.160
It departs at 11 p.m.

10:44.160 --> 10:46.412
They serve dinner onboard?

10:46.496 --> 10:48.581
And a movie and drinks.

10:48.665 --> 10:52.169
Stay down there
for a year.

10:53.170 --> 10:54.505
So?

10:56.173 --> 10:57.800
So...

11:01.095 --> 11:03.180
You certainly
thought this out.

11:03.264 --> 11:05.766
I don't leave
a great deal to chance.

11:08.269 --> 11:10.020
Those will be open?

11:10.104 --> 11:12.606
Take care of the gloves,
the passport and the aim.

11:12.690 --> 11:14.108
I'll handle
everything else.

11:14.191 --> 11:17.152
The gun, the money,
the tickets...

11:17.194 --> 11:18.654
and the dying.

11:18.696 --> 11:20.698
That's right.

11:21.782 --> 11:24.035
Looks like you
get the hard part.

11:24.119 --> 11:26.037
What do you say?

11:26.121 --> 11:28.707
You'll be doing me
a great service.

11:31.209 --> 11:33.295
Will you kill me?

11:38.049 --> 11:39.301
Sure.

11:53.565 --> 11:55.734
Hey! Good to see you.

11:55.734 --> 11:58.237
Slouch,
how are you?

11:59.739 --> 12:01.324
Can I steal you?

12:01.407 --> 12:03.159
If you promise
not to return me.

12:03.242 --> 12:05.161
- Magic today?
- Yeah, Kareem's in the wash.

12:05.244 --> 12:06.829
I need a favor.

12:06.913 --> 12:09.415
- Fletch!
- Did you hear something?

12:09.498 --> 12:12.501
See what we have on Alan Stanwyk
in Beverly Hills.

12:12.585 --> 12:14.337
I need this right away.

12:14.420 --> 12:17.089
- I take it the story's done.
- W-Y-K.

12:17.089 --> 12:19.091
Tell me I'm right.

12:19.175 --> 12:21.177
You're right,
but you're very peaked.

12:21.260 --> 12:23.846
Want to vomit?
Come on in.

12:23.930 --> 12:26.265
- The story's done, right?
- Uh... almost.

12:26.265 --> 12:28.100
Almost is not an answer.

12:28.184 --> 12:30.354
Yes is an answer.

12:30.437 --> 12:33.106
And a damn fine answer.

12:33.273 --> 12:35.275
Professional journalism time now.

12:35.359 --> 12:38.529
Go back and finish
the story!

12:38.612 --> 12:41.448
Frank, I will.
I swear it.

12:41.532 --> 12:42.950
Something came up.

12:42.950 --> 12:45.118
You've got
a deadline tomorrow.

12:45.202 --> 12:47.204
Did you see Sunday's ad?

12:47.287 --> 12:50.207
I don't read the paper.
What's the spread on tonight's game?

12:50.290 --> 12:53.043
- Lakers by six.
- Take a look.

12:54.545 --> 12:56.630
"Shame of the City."
That's very nice.

12:56.713 --> 12:58.632
Try to follow this.

12:58.632 --> 13:01.635
You can't run the ad
and then not run the story.

13:02.886 --> 13:04.389
You can't? Why not?

13:05.723 --> 13:07.225
Shit. Really?

13:08.810 --> 13:12.146
I'm putting you on. You'll get
the story. You'll be proud of it.

13:12.230 --> 13:14.649
You broke it?
You know the source?

13:14.649 --> 13:15.984
Practically.

13:16.067 --> 13:18.903
Is it Fat Sam?
You said you had pictures of him.

13:18.987 --> 13:22.156
- I do have pictures of him dealing.
- Let's go. We'll run them.

13:22.240 --> 13:23.741
You can't do that.

13:23.825 --> 13:26.995
Fat Sam isn't the story.
There's a source behind him.

13:27.078 --> 13:28.997
Who?

13:29.080 --> 13:30.665
That's a gray area.

13:30.748 --> 13:31.916
How gray?

13:33.001 --> 13:34.168
Charcoal.

13:36.839 --> 13:38.841
May I help you with that?

13:40.009 --> 13:41.677
OK. A little lighter.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.679
Can you go higher?

13:43.762 --> 13:46.765
Over to the right.
Higher. Perfect.

13:46.849 --> 13:49.852
Nice and hard.
That's good. Thank you.

13:49.935 --> 13:51.937
- That it?
- Perfect.

13:52.021 --> 13:53.772
Everything's recent.

13:53.856 --> 13:57.359
Let me see that. "Alan Stanwyk,
commercial airline pilot...

13:57.443 --> 13:59.361
from Provo, Utah."

13:59.445 --> 14:02.364
Formerly a test pilot,
member of the Jaycees.

14:02.364 --> 14:04.116
- Move on?
- Yeah.

14:05.534 --> 14:07.036
Married Boyd Aviation.

14:07.119 --> 14:09.121
He's no dummy.
That's big bucks.

14:09.205 --> 14:13.126
His parents are Marvin and Velma,
"were unable to attend the wedding."

14:13.210 --> 14:17.047
Those are three names I enjoy:
Marvin, Velma and Provo.

14:18.882 --> 14:20.634
Hold it there.

14:20.717 --> 14:23.887
Cancer.
"Cancer Society Benefit."

14:23.970 --> 14:27.390
"Internist Dr. Joseph Dolan."

14:27.474 --> 14:30.644
I wonder if
that's his doctor.

14:30.727 --> 14:32.646
One way to find out.

14:32.729 --> 14:34.481
There is.

14:34.731 --> 14:37.317
Where do you
know Alan from?

14:37.400 --> 14:40.237
We play tennis
at the club.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.821
California Racquet Club?

14:41.905 --> 14:44.408
- Right.
- That's my club too.

14:46.077 --> 14:48.412
I don't remember
seeing you there.

14:48.412 --> 14:52.333
I haven't been playing
because of these kidney pains.

14:52.416 --> 14:56.587
Right. How long have you
had these pains, Mr. Barber?

14:56.671 --> 14:58.256
No, that's Babar.

14:59.757 --> 15:00.841
Two B's?

15:01.842 --> 15:03.678
One "B."
B-A-B-A-R.

15:03.761 --> 15:06.013
- That's two.
- Yeah, but not together.

15:06.097 --> 15:08.015
I thought
that's what you meant.

15:11.018 --> 15:12.436
Arnold Babar.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.438
Aren't there
children's books...

15:14.522 --> 15:16.775
about an elephant
named Babar?

15:17.860 --> 15:20.946
- I don't know. I don't have any.
- No children?

15:21.029 --> 15:23.448
No, elephant books.

15:23.532 --> 15:25.450
Open wide.

15:26.285 --> 15:27.369
Say, "Ah."

15:27.452 --> 15:28.787
Aah.

15:29.788 --> 15:31.790
It's an odd name.

15:31.874 --> 15:34.793
I haven't seen it
on the club registry.

15:34.793 --> 15:38.297
I don't formally belong.
I'm a guest of my aunt's.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.715
Your aunt?

15:40.799 --> 15:42.885
- Right. Mrs. Smith.
- Joan or Margaret?

15:42.968 --> 15:44.386
Uh-huh.

15:44.469 --> 15:45.804
Which one?

15:46.889 --> 15:47.973
Margaret.

15:49.892 --> 15:51.561
Funny old bird.

15:51.644 --> 15:53.646
I could tell you
some stories.

15:53.730 --> 15:55.231
I bet.

15:57.317 --> 16:00.570
You know,
it's a shame about Ed.

16:00.653 --> 16:03.573
It was.
That was really a shame.

16:03.656 --> 16:05.575
To go so suddenly.

16:05.658 --> 16:07.827
He was dying
for years.

16:07.911 --> 16:11.164
But the end
was very sudden.

16:13.082 --> 16:15.084
He was in intensive care
for eight weeks.

16:15.168 --> 16:17.086
But the very end,
when he actually died...

16:17.253 --> 16:19.172
was extremely sudden.

16:21.257 --> 16:24.845
Alan and I were recently
speaking of dying.

16:24.929 --> 16:28.265
He told me Boyd Aviation took out
a large insurance policy on him.

16:29.516 --> 16:31.602
You've got to be
in perfect shape...

16:31.685 --> 16:34.355
to get that sort
of a policy, I bet.

16:34.438 --> 16:36.941
Drop your shorts
and bend over, Mr. Babar.

16:37.024 --> 16:40.027
No, really.
We don't need to.

16:40.110 --> 16:42.363
We don't want
to do that.

16:43.697 --> 16:45.699
My kidneys feel better
in this position.

16:45.783 --> 16:48.702
Maybe it's that I'm not doing
any calisthenics.

16:48.786 --> 16:50.955
If I did sit-ups
or bent over like this...

16:51.038 --> 16:53.040
I'd feel 100%/% bet...

16:53.040 --> 16:56.293
# Moon River ##

16:56.377 --> 16:59.297
Whew! Thank you, Doc.
You ever serve time?

16:59.381 --> 17:01.550
- Breathe easy.
- Breathe easy.

17:02.884 --> 17:05.971
I was surprised Alan
got that policy.

17:06.054 --> 17:08.223
There's a history of cancer
in the family.

17:08.306 --> 17:10.474
- There is?
- Yeah.

17:10.559 --> 17:13.979
As a matter of fact... Aah!
You using the whole fist?

17:14.061 --> 17:15.564
Just relax.

17:17.232 --> 17:20.484
I saw Alan the other day.
He was looking peaked.

17:20.569 --> 17:22.988
Are you sure
he's all right?

17:23.070 --> 17:26.074
I can't discuss another patient.
You know that.

17:26.907 --> 17:29.661
Well, I don't find
anything wrong with you.

17:29.744 --> 17:32.915
I'm sure it's not
for a lack of looking.

17:35.251 --> 17:36.836
12 noon.

17:36.919 --> 17:39.255
I was anxious
to return to my drug story.

17:39.338 --> 17:42.008
But since Dr. Jellyfinger
wasn't talking...

17:42.091 --> 17:45.094
I had to find out
about Stanwyk's health.

17:49.599 --> 17:52.018
May I help you, Dr., uh...

17:52.101 --> 17:54.186
Dr. Rosenpenis. I'm here
to check Stanwyk's file.

17:54.270 --> 17:55.438
Doctor who?

17:55.521 --> 17:56.939
Dr. Rosenrosen.

17:56.939 --> 17:58.941
Your name again.

17:58.941 --> 18:00.693
It's Dr. Rosenhite.

18:00.776 --> 18:02.361
Doctor who?

18:02.486 --> 18:04.448
Dr. Rosen.
Where's the records room?

18:04.573 --> 18:07.618
- Next to Pathology.
- Would you take care of these things?

18:07.701 --> 18:11.121
I'd like to check
Alan Stanwyk's file.

18:11.205 --> 18:14.124
Where the hell's
the records room?

18:14.124 --> 18:16.376
Next to Pathology, B1.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.296
Collate these for me.
Where did you say that was?

18:19.379 --> 18:21.298
- B1.
- Thank you very much.

18:21.381 --> 18:23.342
- Take the elevator.
- Thank you.

18:58.169 --> 19:01.089
Give me a hand, Doctor.

19:01.172 --> 19:03.007
Me?

19:03.007 --> 19:04.634
Come on!

19:10.139 --> 19:11.350
Yeah.

19:15.354 --> 19:17.773
Have you ever seen a spleen
that large?

19:17.856 --> 19:21.068
No, not since breakfast.

19:21.193 --> 19:22.695
Here. Hold this.

19:22.778 --> 19:26.031
I haven't sterilized
my hands.

19:26.115 --> 19:29.285
You won't make him
any sicker.

19:39.795 --> 19:42.381
I'll get it.

19:45.635 --> 19:47.304
Ah, oh!

19:47.387 --> 19:50.473
You never get used
to the smell, do ya?

19:58.648 --> 20:02.152
Oh, Doctor.
Are you all right?

20:02.277 --> 20:03.570
Where am I?

20:03.695 --> 20:06.156
- The records room.
- The records room?

20:06.239 --> 20:09.075
- I'm fine.
- Can I get you something?

20:09.159 --> 20:12.245
Do you have
The Beatles' White Album?

20:12.287 --> 20:14.414
Never mind. Get me
a glass of hot fat.

20:14.497 --> 20:16.499
And bring me the head
of Alfredo Garcia.

20:16.583 --> 20:20.755
Dr. Holmes was
surprised you fainted.

20:20.838 --> 20:22.924
He was surprised?

20:22.965 --> 20:25.009
I thought that body
was my dead brother.

20:25.092 --> 20:27.011
Oh!

20:27.094 --> 20:28.930
That spleen was
the spitting image.

20:29.013 --> 20:30.932
No, I'm fine.

20:34.060 --> 20:36.687
Nurse, I'm hyperventilating.

20:36.771 --> 20:38.689
Would you get me
a paper bag?

20:38.773 --> 20:40.858
- Yes, right away.
- Thank you.

21:30.159 --> 21:32.078
Here you are, Doctor.

21:32.161 --> 21:33.496
Oh, thank you.

21:33.580 --> 21:35.498
Can I help you?

21:35.582 --> 21:37.584
No. Uh, yes, there is,
actually.

21:41.254 --> 21:44.257
One of my associates
was doing a biopsy on this man.

21:44.340 --> 21:48.094
They said he had a melanoma,
carcinoma... some kind of noma.

21:49.596 --> 21:51.681
There's no record
of it here.

21:51.764 --> 21:54.684
If he had one,
it would be in here.

21:56.311 --> 21:57.855
Wait. Here it is.

21:57.938 --> 21:59.940
"Surgical removal
of two moles.

22:00.024 --> 22:02.109
Tissue was benign."

22:03.736 --> 22:06.071
Benign? There's no mention
of cancer? That's it?

22:06.197 --> 22:07.656
That's it.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.285
This is one month ago.

22:12.369 --> 22:15.623
According to this hospital,
Alan Stanwyk does not have cancer.

22:15.748 --> 22:17.208
I guess not.

22:18.083 --> 22:19.710
He'll be so relieved.

22:21.712 --> 22:24.215
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

22:24.215 --> 22:26.217
Have a nice day.

22:54.663 --> 22:56.331
I'm not finished.

22:56.414 --> 22:58.583
- Sorry, Mr. Underhill.
- Do I look finished?

22:58.667 --> 23:00.085
I guess not.

23:01.419 --> 23:04.507
- Now I'm finished.
- Whatever you say.

23:12.431 --> 23:14.850
You're expecting
a nice gratuity, right?

23:17.436 --> 23:19.021
Maybe next time.

23:23.109 --> 23:24.443
Gail Stanwyk?

23:24.527 --> 23:26.862
Yeah.

23:26.946 --> 23:28.781
I haven't seen you
since the wedding. You look great.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.117
I do?
That's sweet of you.

23:33.035 --> 23:36.205
I must've been plowed
at your wedding.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.125
I don't know you.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.378
Not my wedding,
your wedding.

23:41.461 --> 23:44.548
Oh, my wedding.
Thank God.

23:44.631 --> 23:48.051
Doesn't really help me.
Are you a friend of Alan's?

23:48.135 --> 23:50.220
Yes, we flew together.
I'm John.

23:50.304 --> 23:52.222
Oh, John.

23:55.225 --> 23:58.145
Oh, yes.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.479
No. John who?

24:00.480 --> 24:02.316
John Cocktoasttoy.

24:02.399 --> 24:03.483
Beautiful name.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.068
It's Scotch-Rumanian.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.487
- An odd combination.
- So were my parents.

24:08.572 --> 24:11.993
Do you mind if I
practice some more?

24:12.076 --> 24:13.578
Go ahead.

24:21.002 --> 24:23.671
You're a member
of the club, senor?

24:23.671 --> 24:26.174
No. I'm with the Underhills.

24:26.257 --> 24:27.759
They left, senor.

24:27.842 --> 24:30.845
He'll be back
after his urinalysis.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.014
Would you like some drinks?

24:33.097 --> 24:35.099
I'll put it on
the Underhills' bill.

24:37.101 --> 24:39.437
Yes. I'll have
a Bloody Mary...

24:39.520 --> 24:42.273
a steak sandwich,
and a steak sandwich.

24:47.529 --> 24:48.948
So how's Alan?

24:49.031 --> 24:53.285
He's been so busy lately,
I hardly see him.

24:53.369 --> 24:56.121
- He's been preoccupied.
- With what?

24:56.205 --> 24:58.874
I don't know.
Personal stuff.

24:58.874 --> 25:01.460
Whoa!
I hit one.

25:01.544 --> 25:03.629
Lobs are important
in tennis.

25:03.712 --> 25:04.797
Sorry, sir.

25:07.132 --> 25:10.302
I'll show you
a couple things.

25:10.386 --> 25:12.137
Stand here.

25:12.221 --> 25:15.391
When the ball comes,
face it like this.

25:15.474 --> 25:16.976
Yeah.

25:17.059 --> 25:18.645
And then
pivot your body,

25:18.728 --> 25:21.231
step in
with your left foot.

25:21.314 --> 25:23.149
Just like this.

25:23.233 --> 25:24.568
OK?

25:24.651 --> 25:26.319
Go ahead. Try one.

25:26.403 --> 25:27.904
All right.
Go ahead.

25:27.988 --> 25:29.906
Get in position.

25:29.990 --> 25:33.159
The ball's going to come.
Ready?

25:33.243 --> 25:34.911
How many are
in the machine?

25:34.995 --> 25:37.581
- A lot, I thought.
- It's finished.

25:37.664 --> 25:39.416
Good.
Much better.

25:40.667 --> 25:44.087
I must be having an off day.
I'm usually a fabulous player.

25:44.170 --> 25:46.172
I affect women this way.

25:46.256 --> 25:48.174
I bet you do.

25:48.258 --> 25:51.929
I bumped into Alan
this morning.

25:51.929 --> 25:53.931
You know what
I can't figure out?

25:54.015 --> 25:55.683
Alan's in Utah.

25:55.766 --> 25:59.437
I can't figure out what I was doing
in Utah this morning.

26:02.273 --> 26:05.860
I'm very flattered,
but I'm also very married.

26:07.361 --> 26:09.780
You're hitting
on me, aren't you?

26:09.864 --> 26:11.115
How did you guess?

26:12.533 --> 26:15.369
I'm such a heel.
Don't know what came over me.

26:15.453 --> 26:19.540
If I had a nickel
for every one of Alan's flyboy
buddies who tried to pick me up...

26:19.624 --> 26:20.958
I'd be rich.

26:21.125 --> 26:22.877
You are rich.

26:22.960 --> 26:24.713
See what I mean?

26:27.549 --> 26:30.969
The vice president knew
I was opening the door...

26:31.053 --> 26:32.804
but the Secret Service...

26:32.888 --> 26:34.306
Whack!
And blood...

26:36.642 --> 26:38.227
Washington.

26:38.310 --> 26:40.062
Sugar, Mr. Poon?

26:40.145 --> 26:42.314
No, never, never.
Thank you.

26:48.070 --> 26:50.489
Well, now,
let me reiterate...

26:50.572 --> 26:52.908
that this is not
a formal investigation.

26:52.991 --> 26:57.246
If Alan Stanwyk isn't involved
in improprieties...

26:57.329 --> 27:00.667
Alan Stanwyk is not involved
in any improprieties.

27:00.750 --> 27:04.671
How can the S.E.C.
make such an accusation?

27:04.671 --> 27:07.006
You know that,
and I know that...

27:07.006 --> 27:10.343
but somebody's bucking
for a promotion.

27:10.426 --> 27:12.512
It's probably that
pederast Hanrahan.

27:12.595 --> 27:14.681
If I don't go back
with something...

27:14.764 --> 27:17.100
you and your son-in-law
will be the scapegoats.

27:17.183 --> 27:19.852
Unbelievable.
This is unbelievable.

27:19.936 --> 27:22.855
They want to know
why he's in Utah.

27:22.939 --> 27:26.442
Jesus H. Christ
on a Popsicle stick.

27:26.526 --> 27:27.777
First of all...

27:27.860 --> 27:31.198
Alan Stanwyk does not own
one single share of stock.

27:32.032 --> 27:34.118
The $3 million
for the ranch in Provo...

27:34.201 --> 27:36.370
was entirely provided
by my daughter...

27:36.453 --> 27:41.792
who converted her personal,
non-corporate holdings.

27:43.127 --> 27:45.880
So, if any
of your D.C. boys...

27:45.880 --> 27:49.216
want to challenge that,
bring them on.

27:49.300 --> 27:54.305
Otherwise, tell them
to get out of my face.

27:57.558 --> 27:59.977
God, I admire you.

28:03.647 --> 28:05.150
Well...

28:05.233 --> 28:07.235
consider
this case closed.

28:10.822 --> 28:13.491
It stopped bleeding.
Isn't that something?

28:13.575 --> 28:14.993
My pleasure.

28:15.076 --> 28:17.078
Thank you and good day.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.496
By the way...

28:20.165 --> 28:22.167
what kind
of a name is Poon?

28:23.168 --> 28:25.503
Comanche Indian.
Good-bye.

28:27.255 --> 28:30.175
Madeline, Frieda lost the number
for Alan's realtor in Provo, Utah.

28:30.258 --> 28:31.843
Could you get me that?

28:31.927 --> 28:33.929
- Jim Swarthout?
- Yeah.

28:37.682 --> 28:39.602
- Who are you again?
- I'm Frieda's boss.

28:40.603 --> 28:43.022
- Who's Frieda?
- My secretary.

28:46.025 --> 28:49.111
I knew my junkie pals were awaiting
my good cheer on the beach...

28:49.195 --> 28:52.198
but I needed a second wind,
a beer and a wardrobe change.

28:55.868 --> 28:58.621
As I pulled up to
my imitation apartment building...

28:58.704 --> 29:03.459
I observed the Oldsmobuick
of Mr. Arnold T. Pants, Esquire...

29:03.459 --> 29:06.546
attorney for the former
Mrs. Erwin Fletcher.

29:07.797 --> 29:10.466
Time to use
the service entrance.

29:45.670 --> 29:49.591
Refusal to pay alimony
is a jailable offense, Fletch.

29:53.177 --> 29:55.597
What about trespassing
and loitering?

29:55.680 --> 29:57.849
I am neither loitering
nor trespassing.

29:57.932 --> 30:00.268
I've simply chosen
an advisable location...

30:00.351 --> 30:02.854
to await my client's
delinquent husband.

30:02.937 --> 30:06.024
I prefer to discuss
business inside.

30:09.777 --> 30:11.779
Leave your rubbers outside.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.702
A little one-on-one?

30:20.456 --> 30:22.791
He draws the foul.

30:25.544 --> 30:27.796
You owe Wendy $918.

30:27.880 --> 30:30.966
She doesn't need it. She's been
living with somebody for months.

30:31.050 --> 30:33.052
I don't
what you're referring to.

30:33.135 --> 30:34.970
Wendy maintains
her own residence.

30:35.054 --> 30:36.472
This stinks.

30:36.555 --> 30:39.892
I empathize, Fletch.
However, you threw her out.

30:39.975 --> 30:42.061
She slept with everybody.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.896
Prove that in court.

30:43.979 --> 30:45.898
My lawyer was a bum.

30:45.898 --> 30:47.233
I agree.

30:47.316 --> 30:48.817
They slept together.

30:48.901 --> 30:51.488
You may be right.

30:51.571 --> 30:52.906
Are you serious?

30:52.989 --> 30:54.491
That's history, Fletch.

30:54.574 --> 30:57.077
You owe us $918.

30:59.996 --> 31:00.997
Hey!

31:01.081 --> 31:05.585
I think our problems may just
be solved. Ed McMahon.

31:07.003 --> 31:10.507
I think I
just won $1 million.

31:10.590 --> 31:13.009
"Erwin M. Fletcher,
you choose."

31:13.093 --> 31:15.595
Whoo-ee! I lost. Sorry.

31:15.679 --> 31:17.347
It's no joke, Fletch.

31:17.430 --> 31:22.352
If some kind of payment isn't made,
I'll have to garnish your wages.

31:23.603 --> 31:26.107
I can't have
my wages garnish-ied.

31:26.190 --> 31:27.191
Tell you what.

31:28.276 --> 31:30.695
Cash? I'm impressed.

31:30.778 --> 31:32.697
I saw my pimp today.

31:33.698 --> 31:35.032
Open your raincoat.

31:35.116 --> 31:37.535
Come on. Just once.
It's worth it.

31:38.869 --> 31:42.373
That's $1,000.
Apply some towards next month.

31:42.456 --> 31:44.375
- Now scram.
- Till then.

31:44.458 --> 31:47.712
Keep 10 and get yourself
a nice piece of ass.

32:05.480 --> 32:07.900
Our guest is
the most valuable player...

32:07.983 --> 32:10.152
of the National
Basketball Association...

32:10.235 --> 32:12.154
from the Los Angeles Lakers...

32:12.237 --> 32:15.407
the all-time scoring champion
of the N.B.A., Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

32:15.490 --> 32:18.410
He's coming off a game that was
second to none in his brilliant career.

32:18.493 --> 32:19.828
You must be proud.

32:19.912 --> 32:21.997
Definitely, Chick.
It was a great effort.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.167
But I had a lot of help,
and we're just glad to be here.

32:25.250 --> 32:27.169
How about Fletch?

32:27.252 --> 32:30.422
What can I say about Fletch?
He's been fantastic.

32:30.505 --> 32:33.259
He boxes out for us,
gets the tough rebounds...

32:33.343 --> 32:35.511
and does what
we need to win.

32:35.595 --> 32:38.765
It's great working with him. I don't
know where we'd be without him.

32:40.099 --> 32:43.603
Let's look at the play.
He's 6'5". With the Afro, 6'9".

32:43.686 --> 32:47.523
Good dribbler. Comes in deep.
His club is behind by one point.

32:47.523 --> 32:51.277
Fletch puts the ball through the legs.
What a great play!

32:51.361 --> 32:53.780
He puts it in!
The Lakers have the lead!

32:53.863 --> 32:57.951
Was that some play! This kid
from Harlem really creates excitement.

32:58.034 --> 33:02.372
$4 million a year,
but he earns every nickel.

33:02.372 --> 33:06.543
Look how he shakes off
four or five defenders with ease.

33:06.543 --> 33:10.130
Fletch... he truly defines
grace under pressure.

33:14.969 --> 33:19.557
See if you've got anything on Stanwyk
from when he lived in Utah.

33:19.640 --> 33:22.893
Yeah. And check out a realtor
in Provo named Swarthout.

33:29.817 --> 33:31.402
Shit!

33:41.663 --> 33:43.081
What's going on?

33:43.164 --> 33:45.000
Take off, Fletch!

33:45.083 --> 33:46.585
What are you doing?

33:46.585 --> 33:48.587
They're after
Gummy again.

33:48.670 --> 33:51.506
Slow down.
This is dumb.

33:57.178 --> 33:58.680
Come on, man!

33:58.763 --> 34:00.265
He's defenseless.

34:01.182 --> 34:02.601
Don't...

34:02.684 --> 34:04.269
Get up!

34:04.352 --> 34:06.354
What are you doing?

34:06.438 --> 34:08.607
Fletch!

34:11.693 --> 34:13.862
Let me out!

34:21.954 --> 34:23.456
Beat it, cop!

34:24.873 --> 34:26.876
Hey, you're really nuts.

34:28.127 --> 34:29.295
You OK?

34:29.378 --> 34:31.380
Yeah. I feel like $100.

34:32.465 --> 34:35.717
- They didn't do anything.
- What are you talking about?

34:35.801 --> 34:37.719
I busted their window.

34:37.803 --> 34:39.639
You're lucky.

34:39.722 --> 34:41.724
It's not luck.
They didn't want me.

34:43.809 --> 34:45.312
They wanted Gummy.

34:46.563 --> 34:48.732
The cops and Gummy...

34:58.659 --> 35:00.994
Relax, Frank.
I need more time.

35:01.078 --> 35:02.996
I could be onto something.

35:02.996 --> 35:04.998
What?

35:05.082 --> 35:08.168
I don't want to spoil your surprise.
Read about it tomorrow.

35:10.003 --> 35:11.755
What do you want?

35:11.838 --> 35:13.423
Don't point. Speak!

35:14.258 --> 35:16.677
- I need Fletch.
- She needs me.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.846
Nothing on Utah
or Jim Swarthout.

35:18.930 --> 35:21.516
I know. Put this
on the back burner.

35:21.599 --> 35:23.935
Right here. That's good.

35:24.018 --> 35:26.854
You wanna give me
just a little hint?

35:26.938 --> 35:28.439
All right, Frank.

35:29.357 --> 35:32.360
- There may be cops involved.
- Did you say cops?

35:32.443 --> 35:34.445
- Yeah.
- That's one thing I found.

35:34.529 --> 35:36.948
- It's from last month.
- What's this?

35:37.031 --> 35:40.368
More cops. Frank,
I need to go to Utah.

35:40.451 --> 35:41.869
Utah?

35:41.953 --> 35:45.039
Yeah, Utah. It's wedged in
between Wyoming and Nevada.

35:45.123 --> 35:47.625
- What about finding the source?
- I have some ideas.

35:49.210 --> 35:52.298
Say yes, Frank. I'll buy you
some new deodorant.

35:53.883 --> 35:56.302
Go to Transportation.
Get a ticket.

35:56.385 --> 35:58.470
- My hero.
- Nothing to it.

36:09.398 --> 36:11.400
You're not recording this,
are you?

36:11.483 --> 36:13.485
No. Never. Never.

36:16.238 --> 36:17.656
Question.

36:25.373 --> 36:26.750
Question.

36:29.085 --> 36:31.880
Why does a man
ask me to kill him...

36:31.922 --> 36:34.925
and lie about dying
when he isn't dying?

36:37.636 --> 36:41.431
Gail Stanwyk converts
$3 million of her stocks...

36:41.514 --> 36:43.099
to buy the ranch.

36:43.183 --> 36:45.018
Why pay in cash?

37:14.882 --> 37:16.801
Mr. Jim Swarthout?

37:16.884 --> 37:20.972
I'm Igor Stravinsky. I'm calling about
some ranch property I'd like to buy.

37:21.055 --> 37:23.057
What did you have in mind?

37:25.059 --> 37:26.811
Mm-hmm.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.813
Are you a friend of Alan's?

37:28.813 --> 37:30.273
No, not exactly.

37:30.398 --> 37:33.235
I overheard some people
talking at the club.

37:33.318 --> 37:36.154
$3 million sounded
like a good price.

37:38.073 --> 37:40.450
Oh, is that right?

37:40.450 --> 37:43.912
In that case,
I have been very misinformed.

37:43.996 --> 37:46.248
Excuse you? Yes.

37:46.331 --> 37:50.085
I'd like to come out and
see you anyway. Is that all right?

37:50.168 --> 37:51.670
What's good for you?

37:51.753 --> 37:55.674
Well, I'm about
to close up shop.

37:55.757 --> 37:57.384
How about tomorrow morning?

37:57.426 --> 38:00.429
First thing in the morning.
Tomorrow. Bye.

38:36.507 --> 38:38.051
Hello!

38:38.134 --> 38:39.887
Anybody home?

38:40.971 --> 38:44.975
Hey, fella, what's your name?
Fluff? Fifi?

38:46.143 --> 38:47.436
All right.

38:48.729 --> 38:49.897
Bad dog.

40:13.733 --> 40:15.151
Sit.

40:44.181 --> 40:45.599
Stay.

40:52.774 --> 40:54.651
I hate dogs.

41:16.965 --> 41:18.633
Come on. Smile.
Say, "Fletch."

41:23.054 --> 41:24.973
Look, defenseless babies.

41:29.979 --> 41:31.981
Fell for the oldest trick
in the book.

41:54.003 --> 41:56.005
# Strangers in the night #

41:56.088 --> 41:58.507
# Exchanging clothing #

41:58.591 --> 42:01.011
# Strangers in my pants... ##

42:03.346 --> 42:04.848
Surprise!

42:04.931 --> 42:07.267
- What the hell's...
- Police. Spread 'em!

42:09.519 --> 42:11.855
- Got a gun?
- Shamu's got one. Borrow his.

42:13.023 --> 42:15.191
- What have we here?
- That's my dick.

42:15.275 --> 42:17.193
Oh, funny boy.

42:17.277 --> 42:18.862
What have we here?

42:18.945 --> 42:20.864
Looks like heroin, Gene.

42:20.947 --> 42:22.866
You just planted that.

42:22.949 --> 42:26.036
- What'd you say?
- Wanna read me my rights?

42:26.119 --> 42:28.371
You have the right
to remain silent.

42:28.455 --> 42:30.457
You have the right
to have your face kicked in.

42:30.540 --> 42:31.541
Nice.

42:31.625 --> 42:33.794
You have the right to have
your balls stomped by him.

42:34.629 --> 42:35.963
I'll waive my rights.

42:46.766 --> 42:48.643
What's the booking, gentlemen?

42:48.643 --> 42:51.312
Possession of narcotics.
The chief wants to talk to him.

42:51.437 --> 42:54.815
You'll like Chief Karlin.
He's a nice man.

42:54.899 --> 42:57.985
I hear he's mellowed
since he came out of the closet.

42:58.069 --> 43:00.571
Take his picture
while he still has a face.

43:00.655 --> 43:02.823
That hurts.
You've been hurting.

43:04.242 --> 43:05.785
Give him a buzz.

43:05.785 --> 43:07.329
Come in.

43:07.412 --> 43:09.414
Here he is, Chief.

43:12.542 --> 43:14.836
Easy, fellas. I'll be
with you in a moment.

43:28.475 --> 43:31.186
Did Mrs. Chief of Police
help you decorate?

43:33.939 --> 43:36.608
So... what's your name?

43:36.692 --> 43:38.110
Fletch.

43:38.193 --> 43:41.948
- Full name.
- Fletch. F. Fletch.

43:42.031 --> 43:46.202
I see. What do you do
for a living, Mr. Fletch?

43:46.286 --> 43:47.745
I'm a shepherd.

43:48.955 --> 43:52.625
Officers, could you excuse us
for a few moments?

43:53.751 --> 43:55.962
Go to the gym
and pump each other.

44:00.383 --> 44:02.594
Why are you doing this?

44:03.636 --> 44:04.804
I like men.

44:04.887 --> 44:06.889
I like to be manhandled.

44:08.725 --> 44:10.560
I like you.

44:10.685 --> 44:14.064
For someone caught holding
a bag of heroin...

44:14.148 --> 44:17.651
- That was planted.
- We're looking at maybe 10 years.

44:17.735 --> 44:19.904
Is that what you want, Jane Doe?

44:20.863 --> 44:22.948
Your editor phoned me...

44:23.073 --> 44:25.034
to respond to allegations
you're about to print...

44:25.159 --> 44:28.412
concerning police involvement
in narcotics dealings.

44:28.495 --> 44:32.499
Uh-uh. I'm about to bust
that beach wide open.

44:32.583 --> 44:35.002
I don't need some penny-ante
Woodward and Bernstein...

44:35.085 --> 44:37.087
to get in the way
of my men.

44:37.171 --> 44:41.091
Your men may be involved in this.
I would think that might interest you.

44:41.175 --> 44:42.843
Idiot!

44:45.346 --> 44:47.849
All right.
Strictly off the record, OK?

44:47.933 --> 44:49.267
Yeah, OK.

44:49.351 --> 44:52.270
I got that beach crawling
with undercover cops.

44:52.354 --> 44:56.566
But if you go nosing around,
you'll make the bad guys more cautious.

44:56.691 --> 44:58.902
Makes my job harder.

44:59.027 --> 45:02.864
And listen, if you print
your story this week...

45:02.948 --> 45:05.533
it might get
some of my men killed.

45:05.617 --> 45:08.286
I can't have that,
Mr. Fletch.

45:08.286 --> 45:09.621
You understand?

45:09.704 --> 45:11.039
Yeah.

45:11.122 --> 45:12.624
I understand.

45:14.793 --> 45:16.127
I got a deadline.

45:17.379 --> 45:19.381
The name's Karlin
with a "K"?

45:19.464 --> 45:21.300
You dipshit!

45:22.468 --> 45:25.471
Go back to that beach,
you won't live to regret it!

45:25.513 --> 45:27.139
All right?

45:28.391 --> 45:30.226
Hey, you and
Tommy Lasorda.

45:30.309 --> 45:32.812
- Yeah.
- I hate Tommy Lasorda.

45:40.486 --> 45:41.821
Hey!

45:44.323 --> 45:46.325
I'll take care of it now.

45:46.409 --> 45:49.328
# Swing low,
sweet chariot #

45:49.412 --> 45:51.831
I'll handle it from here.

45:51.914 --> 45:55.502
# Comin' for
to carry me home ##

45:55.586 --> 45:57.087
Can't keep me here.

45:57.170 --> 45:59.590
Maybe I won't keep you.

45:59.673 --> 46:02.676
Maybe I'll blow
your brains out.

46:04.511 --> 46:07.514
I do believe that's
a violation of my rights.

46:07.598 --> 46:11.685
After I shoot you,
I stick myself with this knife...

46:11.768 --> 46:13.854
and place it
in your dead hand.

46:13.937 --> 46:16.189
Self-defense.

46:16.273 --> 46:19.860
We don't do it anymore,
but back in the old days...

46:22.362 --> 46:23.614
You're serious.

46:23.697 --> 46:25.699
Ask anybody.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.454
Can I ask anybody now?

46:29.537 --> 46:31.539
Can I call my mom,
tell her I love her.

46:31.623 --> 46:33.708
Uh... guess not.

46:45.637 --> 46:48.306
I'm a newspaper reporter. You don't
blow away newspaper reporters.

46:48.389 --> 46:50.308
Kinda stupid, isn't it?

46:50.391 --> 46:52.143
What will it be, Fletch?

46:58.149 --> 47:00.903
Hey, I hate the beach anyway.

47:00.986 --> 47:02.988
It's not even my story.

47:04.990 --> 47:07.076
I've got a deadline
on the off-track betting...

47:07.159 --> 47:08.661
in the Himalayas.

47:08.744 --> 47:11.247
Smaller story, but I know
you've been following it.

47:13.749 --> 47:17.002
You have things
under control down there.

47:17.086 --> 47:19.088
Your beach.

47:26.178 --> 47:28.180
Come on out.
Come on.

47:28.180 --> 47:29.598
May I? Thank you.

47:29.848 --> 47:31.600
How could you call him?

47:31.684 --> 47:32.935
Fletch, I'm sorry.

47:33.018 --> 47:34.938
You know how close
to death I came?

47:35.021 --> 47:36.856
Yeah, it's awful.

47:37.941 --> 47:41.278
He had a gun at my head
and a knife in his hand!

47:41.361 --> 47:43.196
He threatened
to kill me.

47:43.280 --> 47:45.448
Hey, that's a shame.

47:45.532 --> 47:47.450
He would've shot me.

47:47.534 --> 47:48.535
Unbelievable.

47:54.374 --> 47:55.875
You don't believe me.

47:55.959 --> 47:57.460
Nope.

47:58.295 --> 48:00.547
- He thinks I'm lying.
- Unbelievable.

48:00.630 --> 48:02.882
I need an article
by tomorrow.

48:02.966 --> 48:04.884
- You believe me.
- Yes, I do.

48:04.968 --> 48:07.805
I don't want unsubstantiated charges
about dope-dealing cops...

48:07.888 --> 48:12.393
or paranoid fantasies
about homicidal police chiefs.

48:12.476 --> 48:14.562
Give me something
I can print!

48:16.063 --> 48:17.148
Print this.

48:20.318 --> 48:21.736
Me, too.

48:21.819 --> 48:25.406
Hey, watch it.
You're on thin ice, Larry.

48:32.914 --> 48:36.000
It was time to hang out
at Boyd Aviation...

48:36.083 --> 48:39.587
to find out what Stanwyk
was doing with that plane.

48:39.670 --> 48:41.423
I splurged.

48:41.506 --> 48:44.509
I invested 49 cents
on some novelty teeth.

48:54.770 --> 48:56.772
Hey!

48:56.855 --> 48:59.775
- You the guy from Ajax?
- Yeah, you bet.

48:59.858 --> 49:00.943
All right.

49:01.026 --> 49:02.945
- Thought you were bringing the eight?
- They're coming.

49:03.028 --> 49:06.782
I'm the supervisor.
I don't carry the stuff.

49:06.865 --> 49:08.784
Freddie's bringing them?

49:08.867 --> 49:10.285
Yeah. Freddie.

49:10.369 --> 49:13.790
You were supposed to be here
an hour ago.

49:13.873 --> 49:16.209
Traffic was murder.

49:16.292 --> 49:20.296
A manure spreader
jackknifed on the Santa Ana.

49:20.380 --> 49:22.298
God-awful mess.

49:22.382 --> 49:24.717
You should see my shoes.

49:24.801 --> 49:26.719
Whew!

49:29.555 --> 49:30.974
Stanwyk's baby, huh?

49:31.057 --> 49:32.725
Yeah.

49:32.809 --> 49:34.394
Uh-huh.

49:39.983 --> 49:41.484
Looks well-used.

49:41.568 --> 49:43.570
Travels to Utah every weekend.

49:43.653 --> 49:45.488
Is that right?

49:45.572 --> 49:47.241
Is he a Mormon?

49:49.743 --> 49:52.162
I don't think he's doing
a lot of singing...

49:52.246 --> 49:54.415
with the Tabernacle Choir.

49:54.498 --> 49:57.334
These executives live high.
Know what I mean?

49:57.418 --> 49:58.836
I sure do.

50:07.761 --> 50:10.598
That's a terrific wing.
I love this shape.

50:13.267 --> 50:15.102
Do us a favor, pal.

50:15.185 --> 50:16.937
Name's Liddy.
Gordon Liddy.

50:17.021 --> 50:19.940
Take a look
at the seventh Fetzer valve.

50:19.940 --> 50:21.443
It's been sticking.

50:22.944 --> 50:24.613
Probably the humidity.

50:25.947 --> 50:27.365
That's funny.

50:27.449 --> 50:30.869
I think it's
the by-pass line.

50:32.037 --> 50:35.457
It could be the by-pass line.
I should look at it.

50:40.128 --> 50:41.630
Uh, Gordo?

50:42.714 --> 50:44.215
Back here?

50:45.300 --> 50:47.636
Don't tell me
my business, boy!

50:47.636 --> 50:50.388
Just checking the luggage.

50:50.472 --> 50:54.143
Somebody should clean these windows.
There's gook all over 'em.

50:54.226 --> 50:55.978
Look at that.

50:57.146 --> 50:59.148
You use a lot of fuel
to go to Utah?

50:59.231 --> 51:00.816
I ask that, too.

51:00.900 --> 51:03.486
Burns enough to go
to South America and back.

51:03.569 --> 51:05.571
South America and back.

51:07.323 --> 51:08.824
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

51:08.908 --> 51:10.993
I always kid him.
I say:

51:11.077 --> 51:14.413
"You doing some stunt flying
up there or something?"

51:15.831 --> 51:17.416
What's he say?

51:17.500 --> 51:20.753
Nothing.
He just gives me that look.

51:20.836 --> 51:23.005
You know,
he's got that look.

51:23.089 --> 51:25.508
Yeah, he just gives him
that look.

51:25.591 --> 51:27.511
Sure.
He's the boss.

51:27.594 --> 51:30.847
Let me look
at this Fetzer.

51:32.849 --> 51:34.851
Uh, Gord.

51:34.935 --> 51:38.438
I know. I'm getting
a bird's-eye view.

51:38.522 --> 51:40.607
Oh, ho ho.

51:40.691 --> 51:42.859
It's the by-pass line, right?

51:42.943 --> 51:44.945
I think so. Yeah.

51:45.028 --> 51:47.030
Told ya.

51:47.114 --> 51:49.283
I'll need some pliers...

51:49.366 --> 51:51.952
and a set of 30-weight
ball bearings.

51:52.035 --> 51:54.121
- What?
- Yeah.

51:54.204 --> 51:56.790
Tell ya what.
I gotta go to my truck.

51:56.873 --> 51:59.793
If Fred gets here before I'm back,
tell him to start without me.

51:59.876 --> 52:02.880
Why do you need
ball bearings?

52:02.964 --> 52:04.382
Come on, guys.

52:04.465 --> 52:07.218
Maybe you need
a refresher course.

52:07.218 --> 52:10.221
Hey, it's all
ball bearings nowadays.

52:13.558 --> 52:16.227
Prepare that valve
with 3-in-1 oil...

52:16.311 --> 52:18.313
and gauze pads.

52:18.396 --> 52:20.648
And I'll need 10 quarts
of antifreeze...

52:20.732 --> 52:22.650
preferably Prestone.

52:22.734 --> 52:25.737
No, make that
Quaker State.

52:26.821 --> 52:29.574
And wash those windows.
They got muck on 'em.

52:29.741 --> 52:31.075
Buenos dias, senor.

52:31.075 --> 52:32.911
Hi. Where's
Mrs. Stanwyk?

52:32.911 --> 52:34.330
In her cabana.

52:34.413 --> 52:36.749
I'm supposed to meet her.
Cabana six?

52:36.832 --> 52:39.919
Cabana one. You would like
something to eat or drink?

52:40.002 --> 52:41.503
Actually, I would.

52:41.587 --> 52:43.505
Charge it
to the Underhills?

52:43.589 --> 52:45.758
Right.
Do you have any caviar?

52:45.841 --> 52:48.510
Si, senor. Beluga.
But it is $80 a portion.

52:48.594 --> 52:50.846
I better just take
two portions.

52:50.930 --> 52:52.848
How's the Lobster Thermidor?

52:52.932 --> 52:55.267
- I recommend it.
- Good. That'll be fine.

52:55.351 --> 52:57.353
Bring two bottles
of Dom Perignon.

52:57.436 --> 52:58.854
Very good, senor.

52:58.938 --> 53:01.941
- Put down $30 for yourself.
- Muchas gracias, senor.

53:12.953 --> 53:14.454
Who is it?

53:14.454 --> 53:16.373
It's John.

53:16.456 --> 53:17.958
John who?

53:17.958 --> 53:21.044
It's John.
John Levin... I don't remember.

53:21.127 --> 53:22.629
John Cocktoastin?

53:23.964 --> 53:25.548
Hi.

53:27.050 --> 53:28.885
Hi.

53:29.970 --> 53:31.972
I was hoping
you'd say that.

53:33.139 --> 53:35.225
I just got out of the shower.

53:35.308 --> 53:37.477
Yeah.
Can I borrow your towel?

53:37.560 --> 53:39.896
My car hit
a water buffalo.

53:40.982 --> 53:42.566
Nice place.

53:44.151 --> 53:47.238
I'm surprised to see you.
What are you doing here?

53:47.321 --> 53:49.240
I ordered some lunch.

53:49.323 --> 53:50.491
For here?

53:50.575 --> 53:52.743
I knew this is where
my mouth would be.

53:55.079 --> 53:56.831
I really should change.

53:56.831 --> 53:59.834
No, you should stay
the wonderful person you are today.

53:59.917 --> 54:01.669
I mean put clothes on.

54:01.752 --> 54:04.338
Make yourself comfortable.

54:04.422 --> 54:06.424
Are you always
this forward?

54:06.507 --> 54:09.260
Only with
wet married women.

54:10.845 --> 54:12.513
Get the door!

54:18.520 --> 54:21.690
Ah. Very good, gentlemen.
Come right in.

54:21.773 --> 54:23.358
Right in this way.

54:25.110 --> 54:26.528
Right in here.

54:26.612 --> 54:29.114
That's good.
That's very nice.

54:29.197 --> 54:30.449
Want I set up?

54:30.532 --> 54:33.785
No, I'll take care of it.
Give each other $20.

54:33.869 --> 54:36.622
- Put it on Underhill.
- Muchas gracias.

54:36.705 --> 54:37.706
Sierra del fuego.

54:41.543 --> 54:43.462
Oh, this is beautiful.

54:43.545 --> 54:45.464
There we have it.

54:46.548 --> 54:49.469
This goes
on the Underhills' bill?

54:49.552 --> 54:51.971
I saved his life
during the war.

54:52.055 --> 54:54.974
- You were in the war?
- No, he was. I got him out.

54:55.058 --> 54:56.726
Oh.

54:56.809 --> 54:58.978
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

54:59.062 --> 55:00.480
This is great.

55:00.563 --> 55:02.315
Let's eat.

55:03.316 --> 55:05.318
- Your bill, senor.
- Oh, thank you.

55:06.736 --> 55:09.822
- $400 for lunch?
- Your guest, senor.

55:09.906 --> 55:13.243
We didn't have
any guests today.

55:13.326 --> 55:16.079
Two bottles of Dom Perignon?
$100 a pop!

55:16.162 --> 55:19.332
- Jesus H. Christ! Where is he?
- With Ms. Stanwyk.

55:19.415 --> 55:21.252
- Where's she?
- Cabana one.

55:21.335 --> 55:23.337
Can I ask you a question?

55:23.420 --> 55:25.506
- Depends on the question.
- More champagne?

55:25.589 --> 55:28.008
- Yes.
- Are you still in love with Alan?

55:28.092 --> 55:31.762
No. I mean, no, you can't
ask me that question.

55:31.845 --> 55:34.932
- Ask me another one.
- Why'd you let me in?

55:36.433 --> 55:38.602
Um, because I'm bored.

55:39.270 --> 55:42.273
If you're bored, why didn't you
go to Utah with Alan?

55:42.273 --> 55:45.943
Utah's not exactly
a cure for boredom.

55:46.026 --> 55:47.444
Good point.

55:47.528 --> 55:50.364
I've never been there.
I shouldn't say that.

55:50.447 --> 55:51.949
What about his parents?

55:52.032 --> 55:54.786
He hasn't seen them for years.
I've never met them.

55:54.869 --> 55:56.788
They don't get along?

55:59.291 --> 56:01.626
- Mrs. Stanwyk.
- Yes?

56:01.710 --> 56:04.713
I'm sorry to disturb you.
It's Ted Underhill.

56:05.797 --> 56:09.551
Thanks for a great time.
I... Whew! ...gotta go.

56:09.634 --> 56:11.469
Wait a minute.
What is this?

56:11.553 --> 56:13.221
Someone of
your acquaintance...

56:13.305 --> 56:15.890
has charged a $400 lunch
to my account.

56:15.974 --> 56:17.892
You don't know
the Underhills?

56:17.976 --> 56:20.812
I'd like to discuss this matter
with you.

56:20.895 --> 56:22.731
I'm just out of the shower.

56:22.814 --> 56:24.816
- Wait a minute.
- I have to wee-wee.

56:24.899 --> 56:26.401
Yes, of course.

56:28.738 --> 56:32.158
- Why did you do it?
- You shouldn't have to pay the bill.

56:32.158 --> 56:34.410
A $400 lunch tab?

56:34.493 --> 56:36.913
It's outrageous.
It's way over the line.

56:36.996 --> 56:39.832
I'll cover it. You can't
go out looking like that.

56:39.916 --> 56:41.918
He might spot you.
Hold on.

56:42.001 --> 56:45.671
You look like you're the same size
as Alan. Put this on.

56:45.755 --> 56:47.924
- Nice suit.
- Just return it.

56:50.343 --> 56:52.094
Any other surprises?

56:53.346 --> 56:54.764
Yeah.

56:54.847 --> 56:57.099
My name is not
John Cocktoastin.

56:58.935 --> 57:02.522
- I wasn't at your wedding.
- Who are you?

57:02.606 --> 57:04.274
I'm Erwin Fletcher.

57:04.358 --> 57:08.612
I write a newspaper column
under the name of Jane Doe.

57:08.695 --> 57:09.696
So?

57:09.780 --> 57:11.198
So...

57:13.784 --> 57:15.869
your husband
hired me to kill him.

57:17.621 --> 57:19.289
Mrs. Stanwyk.

57:20.207 --> 57:22.292
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- In a minute!

57:24.294 --> 57:26.546
Enough surprises.
What are you talking about?

57:26.630 --> 57:28.215
Sit down.

57:30.550 --> 57:34.305
Your husband told me he was dying
of cancer. Is that true?

57:34.389 --> 57:36.474
It's not true.

57:36.557 --> 57:40.395
That property you thought
you were buying in Utah? Not true.

57:42.063 --> 57:43.898
He's a bad guy.

57:43.982 --> 57:46.317
He's involved in something
very big and very bad.

57:46.401 --> 57:48.069
Do you know Jim Swarthout?

57:48.152 --> 57:50.655
Yeah. He's the man
who sold us the ranch.

57:50.738 --> 57:54.742
Wrong. He sold you
$3,000 worth of scrub brush.

57:54.826 --> 57:56.577
I saw the deed.

57:56.661 --> 57:59.247
You saw a forgery.

58:00.915 --> 58:03.251
This is the real deed.

58:03.334 --> 58:05.086
There's Swarthout's name.

58:05.086 --> 58:07.506
If this were legible,
you'd see what I meant.

58:07.590 --> 58:11.093
This dog tried to bite me.

58:11.176 --> 58:13.178
The motel, my car.

58:13.262 --> 58:15.014
The Mormon Tabernacle.

58:15.097 --> 58:17.433
Stop it. Stop.

58:17.516 --> 58:19.518
He's told me a lot of things.

58:19.602 --> 58:22.771
So far, not one has been true.

58:22.855 --> 58:24.857
I'm sorry to have to
tell you these things.

58:24.940 --> 58:27.026
- Mrs. Stanwyk!
- Just wait a minute!

58:28.193 --> 58:31.363
- I'll call my father. He'll know.
- No, you can't.

58:31.447 --> 58:35.367
I know you don't know me,
but you've gotta trust me.

58:37.953 --> 58:39.622
Give me 24 hours.

58:39.705 --> 58:41.625
Mrs. Stanwyk!

58:44.294 --> 58:45.962
You a Laker fan?

58:46.963 --> 58:49.466
No.

58:49.549 --> 58:51.968
- Just a minute!
- I'll take you to a game.

58:51.968 --> 58:54.304
Mrs. Stanwyk!

58:56.973 --> 58:59.309
Sorry. Thanks. Bye.

58:59.309 --> 59:03.730
- What are you talking about?
- I'd like to take you to a Laker game.

59:03.730 --> 59:07.484
- If you need me, call the paper.
- What do I do for 24 hours?

59:07.567 --> 59:10.654
- Act natural.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

01:00:46.586 --> 01:00:50.673
Oh, Jesus. What's he
doing with the chief?

01:00:51.674 --> 01:00:53.843
Seeing Bone Cancer
and Chief Karlin together...

01:00:53.927 --> 01:00:56.180
might lead
to a page one item.

01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:59.600
but without real evidence,
Frank wouldn't print it.

01:00:59.683 --> 01:01:02.686
I had to keep digging...
without a shovel.

01:01:41.059 --> 01:01:43.228
Smog Patrol.
Had your emissions checked?

01:01:43.311 --> 01:01:45.146
- No, sir.
- Fluorocarbons? Ozone?

01:01:45.146 --> 01:01:47.399
- No, sir.
- Well, let's check it out.

01:01:47.482 --> 01:01:49.317
What do you say?

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:51.403
Smells pretty good.

01:01:58.827 --> 01:02:00.912
That's him.

01:02:02.164 --> 01:02:03.666
Unit 12, in pursuit.

01:02:10.756 --> 01:02:13.759
Catch some shuteye.
Lay back and enjoy.

01:02:14.844 --> 01:02:17.930
- Try to breathe through your nose.
- Aaah!

01:02:33.362 --> 01:02:36.950
I use chewing gum on these rides.
It filters out the pollutants.

01:02:37.034 --> 01:02:38.368
Aw, shit!

01:02:38.368 --> 01:02:40.871
You've got good grillwork.
Keep out the ozone.

01:02:40.954 --> 01:02:44.708
I gotta get this thing up to 95,
check out the fluorocarbon output.

01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:51.381
Don't worry about the speed limit.
That's why we've got the police escort.

01:02:51.465 --> 01:02:53.467
- You a cop?
- As far as you know.

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:56.887
You gonna take me to jail
for car theft?

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:59.473
- Why, did you steal the car?
- I sure did!

01:02:59.556 --> 01:03:02.559
I'm not even sure
that's a crime anymore.

01:03:02.643 --> 01:03:04.061
Pull over!

01:03:06.563 --> 01:03:08.733
Hey, look out
for that truck!

01:03:12.904 --> 01:03:16.741
Just a game I play with my buddies.
Hide-and-seek kind of thing.

01:03:16.824 --> 01:03:18.242
They love it.

01:03:20.578 --> 01:03:22.163
What a day!

01:03:22.246 --> 01:03:24.582
Must be a stage two.

01:03:24.582 --> 01:03:26.501
Do a little slip-streaming.

01:03:26.584 --> 01:03:28.753
Whoa! There's Fred!
Won't he be surprised!

01:03:43.018 --> 01:03:46.438
Don't you hear me?
I said pull over...

01:03:49.775 --> 01:03:51.110
Uh-oh.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.532
Got a license?

01:03:56.615 --> 01:03:58.450
Not on me.
You have one?

01:03:58.450 --> 01:04:00.869
- No.
- Pull over, buddy!

01:04:00.953 --> 01:04:05.124
- Hey, Freddie, how's the herpes?
- Pull over!

01:04:05.207 --> 01:04:08.627
- I did before. I'll pull over later.
- Pull over!

01:04:08.711 --> 01:04:12.381
That's it.
Turn your bike in!

01:04:12.464 --> 01:04:14.968
- You're a disgrace to the force!
- Aaah!

01:04:34.821 --> 01:04:35.822
Get the door!

01:04:45.582 --> 01:04:48.252
Congratulations.
You passed the test.

01:04:48.336 --> 01:04:51.505
Raise your left hand.
My men will be right with you.

01:05:23.872 --> 01:05:27.876
Thelma Noble, Ellis Lee Hereford...

01:05:27.876 --> 01:05:29.878
Lee Weaver...

01:05:29.878 --> 01:05:31.380
and Harold Arthur.

01:05:33.465 --> 01:05:36.301
I would like for you to meet
our friends on the dais.

01:05:36.385 --> 01:05:40.722
- Hold your applause until I'm finished.
- More coffee?

01:05:40.806 --> 01:05:42.975
- Kitty Domaine, Selby Desner.
- There you go.

01:05:43.058 --> 01:05:46.895
Barbara Wattell,
Walter Smith...

01:05:46.979 --> 01:05:50.315
Martha Sterling
and Paul Fleming.

01:05:50.399 --> 01:05:53.485
And to my right,
Michael Kenyon...

01:05:54.569 --> 01:05:56.406
Olivia D. Williams...

01:05:56.489 --> 01:05:58.324
Otto Bailey...

01:05:58.408 --> 01:06:00.159
Bea Dorfman.

01:06:00.243 --> 01:06:01.744
And now...

01:06:01.828 --> 01:06:05.915
the Father of
Internal Bushings...

01:06:05.999 --> 01:06:08.584
our very own
and beloved leader...

01:06:08.668 --> 01:06:11.170
A man who needs
no introduction!

01:06:11.254 --> 01:06:12.338
Thank you very much, Sammy.

01:06:12.422 --> 01:06:13.923
I couldn't wait.

01:06:13.923 --> 01:06:16.759
That was a very nice introduction,
and I am...

01:06:16.843 --> 01:06:19.762
very thrilled
and proud to be here.

01:06:19.846 --> 01:06:23.266
It's been a wonderful ceremony
here on behalf of our own Fred...

01:06:23.349 --> 01:06:25.768
"The Dorf" Dorfman!

01:06:26.769 --> 01:06:31.775
- Who is he?
- Fred was darn near death recently.

01:06:31.775 --> 01:06:34.612
He wasn't ashamed to admit to me
that he had syphilis.

01:06:34.695 --> 01:06:38.699
Thank God he stopped it
in its tracks.

01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:42.620
It takes a lot for a man...

01:06:43.954 --> 01:06:47.041
to admit where he got it from
and how he got it.

01:06:47.124 --> 01:06:49.960
Look at him today.
Fred, you look just wonderful.

01:06:50.044 --> 01:06:53.380
The nose looks normal again.
The face has come back into shape.

01:06:53.464 --> 01:06:56.050
It's not drooling anymore.

01:06:56.133 --> 01:06:59.720
And hats off to Marge, his wife,
because that whole experience...

01:06:59.803 --> 01:07:03.224
the three weeks that she stayed
at Trembling Hills has paid off.

01:07:03.308 --> 01:07:06.561
No more alcohol
or sedatives in her life.

01:07:06.645 --> 01:07:09.397
There are many other things
I wanna tell you about Fred...

01:07:09.481 --> 01:07:12.984
things that maybe many of you
already know.

01:07:13.068 --> 01:07:16.404
Sammy, you're not going
to sing for us, are you?

01:07:16.488 --> 01:07:20.575
Did you know that Fred
spent much of his life...

01:07:20.659 --> 01:07:25.163
honoring a profession that has gone
largely unsung around here?

01:07:25.246 --> 01:07:29.084
Some of them are here tonight.
The profession is law enforcement.

01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:33.171
I know Fred feels that too often
our feelings are locked in...

01:07:33.254 --> 01:07:35.675
and we feel restrained
and perhaps even embarrassed...

01:07:35.758 --> 01:07:38.344
to reach out and touch
an officer of the law.

01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:41.013
After all, they are people,
aren't they?

01:07:41.097 --> 01:07:44.767
Stand up. Pat them on the back.
Reach out.

01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:48.354
Shake hands with any one
of these men in blue.

01:07:48.437 --> 01:07:50.856
Hug a cop!
Yeah, go ahead. I said it.

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.692
Yeah!
That's a wonderful feeling!

01:07:52.775 --> 01:07:54.777
I'm so proud tonight!

01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:59.532
# Oh, say can you see #

01:07:59.615 --> 01:08:05.121
# By the dawn's
early light #

01:08:05.204 --> 01:08:09.626
# What so proudly we hail #

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:12.045
# At the twilight's
last gleaming ##

01:08:12.129 --> 01:08:13.880
Hip, hip, hooray!

01:08:13.964 --> 01:08:15.799
Hooray!
Hooray!

01:08:15.882 --> 01:08:17.216
Hooray!
Hooray!

01:08:25.892 --> 01:08:28.228
Mr. Stanwyk,
you are confirmed on Flight 441...

01:08:28.312 --> 01:08:31.564
to Rio de Janeiro tomorrow evening,
11 p.m., first class.

01:08:31.564 --> 01:08:33.817
That's terrific.
Thank you.

01:08:33.899 --> 01:08:36.403
- You reconfirmed this morning.
- You bet I did.

01:08:36.486 --> 01:08:38.488
I'm a bear for detail.

01:08:38.572 --> 01:08:40.823
I hope there's nobody
sitting next to me.

01:08:40.907 --> 01:08:44.746
I always travel first class,
and I take both seats up.

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:47.665
I'm in bridge work.
Bridge construction.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:51.169
These fold-outs
take a lot of space.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:53.087
There is someone
next to you.

01:08:53.171 --> 01:08:57.925
Oh, for God don don!
Who is it? Mr. Singleton?

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.764
- No. The name is Cavanaugh.
- Cavanaugh?

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:04.265
Ah! Morris or Pierre?

01:09:05.767 --> 01:09:07.852
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

01:09:07.935 --> 01:09:10.020
Sally Ann?
Well, terrific.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:12.941
In fact, you purchased
the ticket for Miss Cavanaugh.

01:09:13.024 --> 01:09:15.861
Doesn't mean I want her
sitting next to me.

01:09:17.112 --> 01:09:20.448
The flight's full.
She's connecting out of Provo.

01:09:21.617 --> 01:09:23.702
Oh. All right, fine.

01:09:23.786 --> 01:09:25.871
Provo, Spain?

01:09:25.955 --> 01:09:27.622
Utah.

01:09:27.706 --> 01:09:28.874
Utah.

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:32.711
Frank, don't give me crap
about the beach story.

01:09:32.795 --> 01:09:35.546
- I'm at the airport.
- The airport?

01:09:35.631 --> 01:09:37.883
There are two dozen cops
after my ass.

01:09:37.966 --> 01:09:41.553
I can't go home or to the office.
I'm a man without a country.

01:09:41.636 --> 01:09:45.307
If cops are really after you,
come in here. You'll be OK.

01:09:45.474 --> 01:09:48.394
I couldn't
get through the front door.

01:09:48.477 --> 01:09:50.145
I'm going to Utah.

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:52.732
You go to Utah,
you stay in Utah.

01:09:52.816 --> 01:09:56.152
I'm turning the story over
to a professional reporter.

01:09:56.236 --> 01:09:58.905
The story is Utah.
Trust me.

01:09:58.989 --> 01:10:01.992
You're going to Utah?
Fine.

01:10:02.075 --> 01:10:05.078
If you're story is not on my desk
by 11:30, you're fired.

01:11:34.587 --> 01:11:35.922
Cujo?

01:12:49.914 --> 01:12:52.334
Who the hell are you?

01:12:52.375 --> 01:12:53.960
Get up!

01:12:54.085 --> 01:12:55.670
I'm up.

01:12:57.422 --> 01:12:59.758
- Door was unlocked.
- Lock's busted.

01:12:59.841 --> 01:13:01.176
There you have it.

01:13:02.427 --> 01:13:04.846
I work for the landlord.

01:13:04.888 --> 01:13:07.682
He told me to watch out
for the place.

01:13:07.766 --> 01:13:10.645
- I commend him on his choice.
- What?

01:13:10.645 --> 01:13:12.605
I commend him
on his choice.

01:13:15.316 --> 01:13:17.401
I was supposed to meet
Mrs. Cavanaugh here.

01:13:17.443 --> 01:13:18.611
Who are you?

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:22.156
I'm Don Corleone,
Mrs. Cavanaugh's cousin.

01:13:22.281 --> 01:13:24.283
You know where she is?

01:13:24.367 --> 01:13:25.743
Moved out.

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:29.914
Moved out?
Isn't that something.

01:13:30.039 --> 01:13:33.000
I talked to her last week.
She didn't say a thing about it.

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:35.294
- She moved out.
- You're saying she moved out.

01:13:36.379 --> 01:13:38.714
- This morning.
- This morning?

01:13:38.798 --> 01:13:42.219
God! Uh. We had
so much to talk about.

01:13:43.637 --> 01:13:45.597
Mo Green is out
of the Tropicana.

01:13:45.722 --> 01:13:48.183
My sons, Mike and Fredo,
are taking over.

01:13:48.183 --> 01:13:51.270
What did you
want under the bed?

01:13:54.398 --> 01:13:58.235
I have to pull rank on you.
I didn't want to have to do this.

01:13:58.235 --> 01:14:02.239
I'm with the mattress police.
There are no tags on these mattresses.

01:14:03.991 --> 01:14:06.410
I'm taking you downtown.
Give me the weapon.

01:14:07.661 --> 01:14:09.830
I'm calling the cops.

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:13.500
- This is for the cops.
- Come on, man. I'm her cousin.

01:14:13.583 --> 01:14:14.918
Tell the cops.

01:14:18.756 --> 01:14:22.343
OK. You wanna call the cops,
call the cops.

01:14:23.594 --> 01:14:25.847
Better tie
your shoelaces first.

01:14:48.286 --> 01:14:49.288
Thanks a lot!

01:14:58.297 --> 01:14:59.798
Stretch, what's happening?

01:14:59.882 --> 01:15:02.718
- Got an unbelievable story here.
- Yeah? Great.

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.220
- What can I do?
- Write this down. Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

01:15:05.304 --> 01:15:07.222
Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

01:15:07.306 --> 01:15:10.142
Check every hotel in L.A.
Start near the airport.

01:15:10.225 --> 01:15:12.478
He's supposed to leave the country
with her tomorrow night.

01:15:12.561 --> 01:15:14.063
Got that, honey?

01:15:14.188 --> 01:15:16.273
I love your body, Larry.

01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:35.502
Good afternoon.

01:15:35.585 --> 01:15:37.504
Howdy.

01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:39.589
They should
recall these things.

01:15:39.673 --> 01:15:43.259
Hit one bump
and the window explodes.

01:15:43.343 --> 01:15:44.844
You're Marvin Stanwyk?

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:46.429
- Yeah.
- Hi there.

01:15:46.513 --> 01:15:49.140
Harry S. Truman,
Casewell Insurance underwriters.

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.642
Harry S. Truman?

01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:53.812
My parents were fans
of the former president.

01:15:53.937 --> 01:15:56.607
Isn't that nice.
He was a good man.

01:15:56.691 --> 01:15:59.026
- He sure was.
- He showed the Japs a thing or two.

01:15:59.110 --> 01:16:02.154
- Dropped the big one, huh?
- He dropped two big ones on them.

01:16:02.196 --> 01:16:04.282
- He was a real fighter.
- Yeah.

01:16:04.365 --> 01:16:07.118
You're in insurance, Harry?

01:16:07.201 --> 01:16:08.786
That's right.

01:16:08.911 --> 01:16:12.456
- Well, I'm fully covered.
- I don't doubt it, Mr. Stanwyk.

01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:16.043
Actually, my company
sub-insures a policy...

01:16:16.127 --> 01:16:19.547
held by Alan Stanwyk,
who I believe is your son.

01:16:19.630 --> 01:16:21.048
Yeah, he is.

01:16:21.048 --> 01:16:23.551
Mr. Truman,
meet my wife Velma.

01:16:23.634 --> 01:16:25.469
- My pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

01:16:25.553 --> 01:16:28.306
Sit down and have
a glass of lemonade.

01:16:28.389 --> 01:16:31.852
- Thank you.
- Velma makes the most unusual lemonade.

01:16:31.893 --> 01:16:35.063
It's hard to keep it cold
on a day like this.

01:16:37.065 --> 01:16:39.067
Where you from, Harry?

01:16:40.193 --> 01:16:42.321
I'm from California.

01:16:42.362 --> 01:16:44.323
San Berdoo.

01:16:44.406 --> 01:16:47.242
Yeah. Utah is
part of my route.

01:16:48.619 --> 01:16:53.081
You folks don't mind if I ask you
a couple of questions, do you?

01:16:53.081 --> 01:16:55.584
- Shoot.
- Thank you very much.

01:16:55.584 --> 01:16:58.086
We'll start with
some routine things.

01:16:59.755 --> 01:17:02.592
You and your wife
are currently alive, I take it?

01:17:04.093 --> 01:17:06.596
- Harry, if there's...
- It's just regulations.

01:17:08.264 --> 01:17:12.352
Now, you, Marvin,
and your wife named Velma...

01:17:13.436 --> 01:17:17.357
are the parents of one Alan Stanwyk
of Beverly Hills...

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:19.609
Executive Vice President
of Boyd Aviation.

01:17:19.692 --> 01:17:21.611
- Check.
- Check.

01:17:21.611 --> 01:17:23.696
And when did you last see Alan?

01:17:25.073 --> 01:17:27.033
Oh... uh...

01:17:27.116 --> 01:17:28.660
about 10 days ago.

01:17:28.701 --> 01:17:30.119
10 days ago?

01:17:30.244 --> 01:17:33.790
He comes and visits
about every three weeks.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.796
Isn't that nice.
How long has he done that?

01:17:38.879 --> 01:17:40.547
Since he moved to L.A.

01:17:45.135 --> 01:17:50.808
Pardon me if I seem a bit personal here.
I don't know how to put it.

01:17:50.891 --> 01:17:56.146
We understand that there's
a young lady friend in Provo...

01:17:56.230 --> 01:17:57.982
that Alan's been seeing.

01:17:58.065 --> 01:18:00.150
What's this got to do
with insurance?

01:18:00.234 --> 01:18:02.611
This is a comprehensive policy.

01:18:02.736 --> 01:18:05.155
Forget about
that lady friend business.

01:18:05.197 --> 01:18:07.992
Alan is
a loving husband.

01:18:07.992 --> 01:18:09.995
He dotes on his bride.

01:18:10.078 --> 01:18:11.496
Who?

01:18:11.579 --> 01:18:13.248
His wife.

01:18:14.624 --> 01:18:17.085
You've met her?

01:18:17.168 --> 01:18:19.796
Of course we have.
He brings her with him.

01:18:23.842 --> 01:18:27.053
Has Alan ever mentioned
the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh?

01:18:27.929 --> 01:18:29.597
Has he?

01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:35.979
Boy, what in the hell's
the matter with you?

01:18:36.021 --> 01:18:38.356
- He has.
- Of course he has.

01:18:38.356 --> 01:18:39.691
That's his wife.

01:18:41.443 --> 01:18:42.945
Of course.

01:18:43.029 --> 01:18:45.615
His wife's name
is Sally Ann Cavanaugh.

01:18:45.698 --> 01:18:48.784
Cute as a button.

01:18:48.868 --> 01:18:51.787
You wouldn't have
a picture of them, would you?

01:18:51.871 --> 01:18:54.040
We've got lots of pictures.

01:18:54.123 --> 01:18:56.250
- Let me get you some.
- Great.

01:18:58.210 --> 01:19:00.296
Still married are they,
Alan and Sally Ann?

01:19:00.379 --> 01:19:01.714
Yes, they are.

01:19:01.797 --> 01:19:03.799
How long have
they been married?

01:19:03.883 --> 01:19:07.887
It was before
he moved to L.A.

01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:09.972
Eight years April.

01:19:10.056 --> 01:19:12.141
This gets heavier
each year.

01:19:12.224 --> 01:19:15.645
There we are.
Here it is.

01:19:15.728 --> 01:19:18.065
- That's the one.
- Oh, my goodness.

01:19:18.065 --> 01:19:20.400
She is a button,
isn't she?

01:19:20.484 --> 01:19:21.985
Isn't she cute?

01:19:22.069 --> 01:19:25.656
Could I borrow this picture?
I promise to send it back.

01:19:25.739 --> 01:19:29.660
- It's routine. The actuarial people...
- That's all right. We have more.

01:19:29.701 --> 01:19:32.788
- Want to see the reception?
- No, thank you. I'm trying to quit.

01:19:32.913 --> 01:19:34.915
How about Marvin's
65th birthday party?

01:19:34.998 --> 01:19:38.085
- How about that, Marvin?
- They got a picture of me in here.

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:43.090
This is Alan?
I can't believe this!

01:19:43.215 --> 01:19:45.592
It's really Alan,
and it's really bigamy.

01:19:45.592 --> 01:19:48.679
- How long have they been married?
- About eight years.

01:19:48.762 --> 01:19:49.847
Who is this woman?

01:19:49.973 --> 01:19:53.601
I think it's Alan's
high school sweetheart.

01:19:54.686 --> 01:19:56.521
Sally Ann something or other.

01:19:57.355 --> 01:20:00.775
Alan's been keeping
many secrets lately.

01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:02.485
I'm calling the police.

01:20:02.527 --> 01:20:04.070
No, Gail, don't.

01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:07.365
- I'm calling my father.
- Give me one more day.

01:20:07.448 --> 01:20:11.286
Why? Do you have any idea
how humiliating this is?

01:20:11.369 --> 01:20:13.454
Yes, I do.
I really do.

01:20:16.082 --> 01:20:19.377
Remember what I told you?
Tomorrow night you have a club meeting.

01:20:19.460 --> 01:20:22.463
Stay away from the house.
I'll take care of him.

01:20:22.463 --> 01:20:24.550
- Don't worry.
- She looks like a hooker.

01:20:24.633 --> 01:20:27.970
Look at her. Could you love
someone who looked like that?

01:20:28.012 --> 01:20:29.972
What are you talking about?
Of course not.

01:20:31.473 --> 01:20:34.310
5, 10 minutes tops,
maybe.

01:20:35.644 --> 01:20:37.146
It's funny.

01:20:38.439 --> 01:20:40.107
I know. Listen.

01:20:41.233 --> 01:20:45.988
Why don't we relax and lie down
and I'll fill you in.

01:20:48.949 --> 01:20:52.494
This is a good time
to make a pass at me.

01:21:21.941 --> 01:21:25.403
- Gum?
- Who? Go somewhere else.

01:21:25.445 --> 01:21:27.489
Gum, it's me.

01:21:28.865 --> 01:21:32.203
- Fletch. Really, is that you?
- Shut up. Don't say my name.

01:21:32.203 --> 01:21:35.206
Shut up. Don't look at me.
I gotta talk to you.

01:21:35.331 --> 01:21:37.458
All right. About what?

01:21:39.293 --> 01:21:41.629
There are cops all around here.
They're after me.

01:21:41.712 --> 01:21:44.799
- You mean those surfers over there?
- Lay back down.

01:21:44.882 --> 01:21:47.635
- Don't point. Just lay back.
- OK.

01:21:47.718 --> 01:21:51.138
- Why they after you?
- I'm a newspaper reporter.

01:21:51.222 --> 01:21:54.058
I'm nailing Chief Karlin as
the major drug source on this beach.

01:21:56.686 --> 01:21:58.771
Sit back.

01:21:59.814 --> 01:22:02.817
Fat Sam's turning
State's evidence.

01:22:02.942 --> 01:22:04.403
What's that?

01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:07.489
He wrote me
a nice deposition.

01:22:07.614 --> 01:22:09.574
Said he received the drugs
and you did the selling.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.161
He said what?
Fletch, he's lying.

01:22:13.245 --> 01:22:16.331
I didn't sell nothing.
You gotta believe me.

01:22:16.415 --> 01:22:19.334
I just carried the drugs
from the chief to Sam.

01:22:19.418 --> 01:22:22.921
- Sure you did, Gum.
- Honest, man. That's all I did.

01:22:22.921 --> 01:22:27.592
20 years in prison, Gum.
Unless you want to play ball.

01:22:31.513 --> 01:22:33.515
You don't leave me
much choice.

01:22:37.895 --> 01:22:39.856
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

01:22:39.981 --> 01:22:43.443
These robes...
I got another question.

01:22:43.526 --> 01:22:46.195
Where does the chief
get his drugs?

01:22:46.237 --> 01:22:47.614
I don't know.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:51.909
Have fun.
Don't bend over for the soap.

01:22:51.951 --> 01:22:53.369
Fletch.
Fletch, OK.

01:22:55.872 --> 01:22:57.874
It's somewhere
in South America.

01:23:02.920 --> 01:23:04.881
Mind if I sit here?

01:23:04.964 --> 01:23:06.299
Fletch?

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:07.967
Man...

01:23:08.092 --> 01:23:10.888
- You don't know me, Sam.
- My pleasure, brother.

01:23:10.971 --> 01:23:12.806
I'm a reporter, Sam.

01:23:12.890 --> 01:23:16.435
I'm breaking the story
on the drug traffic around here.

01:23:16.477 --> 01:23:18.145
Gummy's turning
State's evidence.

01:23:18.228 --> 01:23:20.648
I got good proof
it's the chief.

01:23:20.648 --> 01:23:22.691
You gonna bust the chief?

01:23:22.733 --> 01:23:24.485
Gonna bust the chief.

01:23:26.654 --> 01:23:28.656
I could use your help.

01:23:31.533 --> 01:23:34.495
I'm a slave to that
son of a bitch.

01:23:34.578 --> 01:23:36.789
He busted me,
third offense.

01:23:36.914 --> 01:23:41.460
Said push for him or do 15 long.
All I get from this is free junk.

01:23:41.502 --> 01:23:44.255
- You don't have a piece of the action?
- No. Free junk, that's it.

01:23:50.095 --> 01:23:51.763
Hey, how you doing?

01:23:51.846 --> 01:23:55.016
Albert Einstein's forehead.
You like it? Won it in a raffle.

01:23:55.058 --> 01:23:57.268
Fellas, stay with me.

01:23:57.352 --> 01:23:59.437
Fletch?

01:24:00.605 --> 01:24:02.023
What's up?

01:24:02.023 --> 01:24:04.192
- I'm quitting at midnight.
- Who are they?

01:24:04.275 --> 01:24:07.278
This is Fat Sam and Gummy.
Come with me.

01:24:07.362 --> 01:24:09.280
Their statements
name Chief Karlin...

01:24:09.364 --> 01:24:12.033
as the number one drug pusher
from here to Oxnard.

01:24:12.117 --> 01:24:14.869
I want them to have Federal protection
sponsored by the paper. OK?

01:24:19.208 --> 01:24:21.794
- This is wonderful.
- I'm out, Frank.

01:24:21.877 --> 01:24:24.964
- You lost faith in me.
- Fletch, I got nervous.

01:24:25.047 --> 01:24:27.216
Forget it.
I'm writing the story.

01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.635
Hold the last two paragraphs
till 10:00.

01:24:29.719 --> 01:24:32.221
You want an apology?

01:24:32.221 --> 01:24:34.807
- You were going to can me, right?
- No, not really.

01:24:34.890 --> 01:24:38.352
- Not really?
- I was upset. You know.

01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:44.400
OK. Jesus,
I'm sick of this place.

01:24:44.483 --> 01:24:45.568
Ow.

01:24:45.609 --> 01:24:49.322
I'll try out for the Lakers.
They need a power forward.

01:24:49.405 --> 01:24:52.159
This is a hell of a story.

01:24:52.242 --> 01:24:53.243
Thanks.

01:24:53.327 --> 01:24:55.537
- About these guys...
- They're fine.

01:24:55.537 --> 01:24:58.665
You don't have valuables
in there, do you?

01:27:15.723 --> 01:27:17.224
Good evening.

01:27:23.648 --> 01:27:26.233
I like your outfit.

01:27:26.317 --> 01:27:28.319
Did you bring the 50 grand
and the tickets?

01:27:28.402 --> 01:27:30.363
Of course.

01:27:30.363 --> 01:27:33.574
Oh, oh, oh. You forgot
your rubber gloves.

01:27:33.658 --> 01:27:36.160
You're planning
on killing me, aren't you?

01:27:38.497 --> 01:27:41.083
You catch on real quick,
Mr. Nugent.

01:27:41.166 --> 01:27:43.251
That's a hostile thing to do.

01:27:43.377 --> 01:27:47.506
You were gonna kill me.
I look at this as self-defense.

01:27:47.589 --> 01:27:51.593
Now, if you would be so kind
as to put your passport on my desk.

01:27:55.597 --> 01:27:58.266
You're wearing my suit.
Where did you get that?

01:27:59.685 --> 01:28:02.688
Where did you get my suit,
Mr. Nugent?

01:28:02.729 --> 01:28:05.607
The name's Fletcher.
I'm a newspaper reporter.

01:28:05.607 --> 01:28:07.693
I write a column
under the name Jane Doe.

01:28:07.776 --> 01:28:11.280
- What is this?
- Read this.

01:28:11.364 --> 01:28:14.033
- I don't have time...
- Cut the crap.

01:28:14.117 --> 01:28:16.035
Come read this.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:28:29.549 --> 01:28:32.427
Unless my people hear differently,
that letter goes out at midnight.

01:28:41.477 --> 01:28:42.895
"Dear Mr. Boyd:

01:28:42.979 --> 01:28:45.065
Alan Stanwyk
murdered me tonight.

01:28:48.569 --> 01:28:51.405
Charred remains found in the Jaguar
are mine, not his.

01:28:52.573 --> 01:28:54.658
Mr. Stanwyk,
using my name and passport...

01:28:54.742 --> 01:28:56.869
boarded Pan Am Flight 306.

01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:58.954
- On arrival, he intends..."
- Pretty hefty.

01:29:01.123 --> 01:29:02.750
Keep reading.

01:29:02.833 --> 01:29:05.294
"...with his legal wife...

01:29:05.419 --> 01:29:07.421
the former
Sally Ann Cavanaugh..."

01:29:07.504 --> 01:29:09.089
Don't stop, Alan.

01:29:14.136 --> 01:29:17.098
- Uh-oh. The missus.
- What are you doing here?

01:29:17.223 --> 01:29:19.934
I know most of it. I want
to hear the rest from you.

01:29:21.186 --> 01:29:24.689
He doesn't read my stuff very well.
Let me take a crack at it.

01:29:24.773 --> 01:29:27.942
"Sally Ann and Alan
were married eight years ago...

01:29:30.528 --> 01:29:33.365
never divorced, making Stanwyk
a bigamist, even in Utah.

01:29:34.491 --> 01:29:37.202
Stanwyk is traveling
with $3 million in cash...

01:29:37.285 --> 01:29:40.538
the result of Gail Stanwyk's
conversion of Boyd Aviation stock."

01:29:45.710 --> 01:29:47.504
It's true, isn't it?

01:29:47.545 --> 01:29:49.547
"Sally Ann
can confirm this...

01:29:49.589 --> 01:29:51.550
when the police pick her up
at the Airport Marriott."

01:29:51.676 --> 01:29:53.552
Isn't that where she is?

01:29:55.221 --> 01:29:57.890
"By the way,
Alan is a big drug smuggler.

01:29:57.932 --> 01:30:01.394
But you can read about that
in tomorrow's paper.

01:30:02.228 --> 01:30:04.689
Sincerely, I.M. Fletcher.
P.S. Have a nice day."

01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:08.067
Bravo, Mr. Fletcher.
Bravo.

01:30:08.150 --> 01:30:11.904
What tipped me was something your wife
said while we were in bed together.

01:30:16.158 --> 01:30:19.412
Oh?
And what was that?

01:30:19.495 --> 01:30:22.957
She said we had roughly
the same build.

01:30:23.082 --> 01:30:25.043
From the waist up,
I imagine.

01:30:27.254 --> 01:30:29.172
Then I figured it.

01:30:29.214 --> 01:30:31.300
You bump me off,
plop me in the car...

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:32.843
and burn me up.

01:30:34.845 --> 01:30:37.347
What the heck,
same bone structure.

01:30:37.431 --> 01:30:39.057
You son of a bitch.

01:30:39.099 --> 01:30:42.019
But I'm not a stupid
son of a bitch.

01:30:42.102 --> 01:30:44.604
I was prepared to commit
one murder, assface.

01:30:44.688 --> 01:30:48.108
What makes you think
I won't commit two?

01:30:48.191 --> 01:30:51.111
- Whoops.
- What do you mean, "Whoops"?

01:30:51.153 --> 01:30:53.739
By the time your story's published,
I'll be on the beach.

01:30:53.864 --> 01:30:57.618
I understand extradition
from South America's complicated.

01:30:57.702 --> 01:30:59.704
For two murders,
it's even more so.

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:03.082
That thing loaded?

01:31:03.082 --> 01:31:04.626
If you shoot me...

01:31:04.667 --> 01:31:06.794
you're liable to lose
those humanitarian awards.

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:08.546
Tough shit, Hopalong.

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:09.881
Greetings, everyone.

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.635
Thank God, the police.

01:31:13.718 --> 01:31:16.220
What are you doing here?

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.890
Put the gun down.
I can take care of them.

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:21.976
Thought you had this figured out.
Nice going, Erwin.

01:31:22.060 --> 01:31:24.312
Don't ever
call me Erwin.

01:31:24.395 --> 01:31:26.981
Fat Sam and Gummy
left the beach today.

01:31:27.065 --> 01:31:32.154
It occurred to me that maybe there are
things happening I should be aware of.

01:31:32.237 --> 01:31:35.574
I'll take care of this.
It doesn't involve you. Go home.

01:31:35.658 --> 01:31:37.576
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What? Long distance?

01:31:38.077 --> 01:31:41.080
Overheard you say something
about South American extradition.

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:45.668
Are you taking that $800,000
I staked you with on the next load?

01:31:45.751 --> 01:31:47.836
You two have a lot
to talk over.

01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.923
We'll just catch the last
ten minutes of "Dynasty."

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:53.175
Jerry,
you're gonna have to trust me!

01:31:53.258 --> 01:31:56.428
I got a way to get rid of this asshole,
and you're jeopardizing everything!

01:31:56.512 --> 01:31:58.597
Your way is gonna land my butt
on the front page...

01:31:58.681 --> 01:32:00.432
while you're basking
in the sun!

01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:02.101
With your money.

01:32:17.867 --> 01:32:19.953
The second one's
going to be more fun.

01:32:20.036 --> 01:32:21.871
Go ahead, make my day.

01:32:47.648 --> 01:32:48.816
Thanks.

01:32:50.234 --> 01:32:52.069
No, this is getting absurd.

01:32:52.153 --> 01:32:54.989
"One Bob Haldeman wig,
a gorilla suit."

01:32:55.072 --> 01:32:56.991
- A gibbon suit.
- "Tennis shorts.

01:32:57.074 --> 01:32:58.743
leather sneakers,
wrist bands."

01:32:58.826 --> 01:33:01.495
- It's business. I hate tennis.
- What's novelty teeth?

01:33:01.579 --> 01:33:04.915
Frank, it's all business.

01:33:04.915 --> 01:33:07.001
"A nun's habit.
Six tubes of Crazy Glue."

01:33:07.084 --> 01:33:08.669
That's personal.

01:33:08.753 --> 01:33:11.923
- Take it out of my raise.
- You're not getting a raise. Come on.

01:33:12.007 --> 01:33:15.761
I would think the D.A. would need
these tickets for evidence.

01:33:15.844 --> 01:33:17.012
Not necessarily.

01:33:17.095 --> 01:33:19.348
- Not necessarily?
- Larry!

01:33:21.516 --> 01:33:23.685
In the court ruling
"U.S. vs. Fishbein"...

01:33:23.769 --> 01:33:26.355
a man subjected to
potential incineration...

01:33:26.438 --> 01:33:28.273
while wearing
another man's suit...

01:33:28.357 --> 01:33:30.359
is entitled to $10,000 worth
of airline tickets.

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:34.029
It's an obscure ruling
but very important one to me.

01:33:34.112 --> 01:33:38.283
Why don't you say that you want
to take me to Rio with you?

01:33:38.367 --> 01:33:41.620
There's a different slant.

01:33:43.622 --> 01:33:45.875
The thing is, we haven't
really dated formally.

01:33:45.958 --> 01:33:47.960
I take first dates
to Laker games.

01:33:48.044 --> 01:33:51.130
I don't want to go
to a Laker game.

01:33:51.214 --> 01:33:52.465
I don't like basketball.

01:33:52.548 --> 01:33:55.301
Maybe that's because
you don't understand basketball.

01:33:55.385 --> 01:33:58.054
You haven't learned the fundamentals.
The pick and roll.

01:33:58.137 --> 01:34:00.139
Sounds like a fast-food chain.

01:34:00.139 --> 01:34:02.141
- Reverse stuff.
- That I've done.

01:34:02.225 --> 01:34:04.310
I'll bet you have,
you little vixen.

01:34:04.394 --> 01:34:06.646
The coroner
had certified Stanwyk dead...

01:34:06.729 --> 01:34:08.898
or extremely sleepy.

01:34:08.982 --> 01:34:12.568
And Chief Karlin was facing
20 years in the fun house.

01:34:12.652 --> 01:34:14.654
I decided
to accompany Gail to Rio...

01:34:14.737 --> 01:34:17.574
and personally assist her
in her grief therapy.

01:34:17.658 --> 01:34:21.245
On the beach, I explained basketball
to her, but she didn't grasp it.

01:34:21.328 --> 01:34:23.414
- Fletch?
- Call me Erwin.

01:34:26.583 --> 01:34:28.836
Why do they bounce
the ball the whole time?

01:34:28.919 --> 01:34:31.588
Doesn't it seem
a little childish?

01:34:31.672 --> 01:34:33.924
Well, it may seem that,
but that's called dribbling.

01:34:34.008 --> 01:34:36.593
- "Dribbling"?
- If they stop bouncing the ball...

01:34:36.677 --> 01:34:38.345
they get called for traveling.

01:34:38.429 --> 01:34:40.681
Traveling. Aha.

01:34:40.764 --> 01:34:42.933
That's what they call it
when you don't bounce the ball.

01:34:43.017 --> 01:34:45.602
When it came to basketball,
Gail was a loss.

01:34:45.686 --> 01:34:47.688
But we had our own version
of one-on-one...

01:34:47.771 --> 01:34:51.443
and she thought I was the bravest man
in the world, which I am.

01:34:51.526 --> 01:34:55.113
By the way, I charged the vacation to
Mr. Underhill's American Express card.

01:34:55.196 --> 01:34:56.531
Want the number?

01:34:56.531 --> 01:34:58.033
