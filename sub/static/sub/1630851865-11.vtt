Ah! So quiet. So peaceful.

00:40.160 --> 00:42.760
-So...
-Whee!

00:42.919 --> 00:46.800
-At least, it was quiet.
-Woohoo!

00:47.280 --> 00:49.559
-Moon, what are you doing?
-Yay! Yeah-ha!

00:49.680 --> 00:51.040
Riding a roller coaster!

00:51.199 --> 00:53.360
It looks like you're sitting in a box.

00:53.519 --> 00:57.519
Nope! I'm on the fastest
roller coaster in the world!

00:57.680 --> 01:00.199
Uh-oh! Here comes the big drop!

01:00.360 --> 01:02.320
Ah!

01:04.280 --> 01:08.720
Wow. What. A. Ride.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.560
-I'm going again.
-Moon, wait.

01:10.720 --> 01:13.240
You think you could play
something quieter?

01:13.440 --> 01:15.160
Sure. Only what?

01:15.280 --> 01:18.600
[gasps]
Ollie! I'm having a brainstorm!

01:19.200 --> 01:22.000
Uh-oh. Every time you have a brainstorm,

01:22.160 --> 01:24.080
I get dragged off somewhere.

01:24.440 --> 01:29.880
Why don't we play... Ask or Adventure?

01:30.520 --> 01:33.440
-What's that?
-If you pick ask,

01:33.600 --> 01:36.360
I ask a question
and you have to tell the truth.

01:36.479 --> 01:38.080
That does sound quiet at least.

01:38.560 --> 01:41.479
But if you pick adventure...

01:43.399 --> 01:46.360
I get to choose something
super fun for you to do!

01:46.520 --> 01:49.640
-Let's try it.
-All right. I pick ask.

01:49.759 --> 01:52.759
Oh... You sure you want to pick ask?

01:52.920 --> 01:57.520
I mean, it's up to you,
but adventure is <i>way </i>more fun.

01:57.679 --> 01:59.199
Way more. Way.

02:00.080 --> 02:04.640
I don't know. Would you make it
something fun that I'd like?

02:05.160 --> 02:10.160
Then... OK. Adventure!
What do I get to do?

02:10.320 --> 02:14.160
You get to ride a roller coaster!

02:14.320 --> 02:17.480
I was hoping
for something quieter, but OK.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.840
Not a pretend roller coaster.
A real roller coaster!

02:22.000 --> 02:24.200
-In Florida!
-But...

02:24.400 --> 02:27.359
that looks fast and loud

02:27.519 --> 02:30.400
and more adventurey than I expected!

02:30.560 --> 02:32.560
Maybe I should pick ask instead.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.359
But you can't now! Those are the rules!

02:35.519 --> 02:38.040
And you never break rules.

02:38.200 --> 02:42.519
-True. I do love rules.
-Then what are we waiting for?

02:42.760 --> 02:43.959
Let's go!

02:50.480 --> 02:51.600
Whoo!

02:52.440 --> 02:53.959
Whee!

03:01.799 --> 03:07.160
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we are now arriving in Florida,</i>

03:07.280 --> 03:08.480
<i>USA!</i>

03:13.359 --> 03:15.120
Wow!

03:15.280 --> 03:18.480
It's a lot bigger
than it looks in the picture.

03:18.640 --> 03:20.640
[groans]

03:20.920 --> 03:24.480
Uh-oh. What if I'm too short to go on?

03:24.640 --> 03:27.239
I guess I'd just have
to read about it instead!

03:31.440 --> 03:34.480
Don't worry, Ollie,
just stand up straight!

03:35.519 --> 03:37.679
[giggles]

03:37.799 --> 03:42.119
See? You are tall enough! Lucky you!

03:42.280 --> 03:43.720
Lucky me.

03:48.560 --> 03:50.920
Where am I this time?

03:51.079 --> 03:53.519
-Scoot!
-Ollie! Moon!

03:53.880 --> 03:58.679
Boy, am I glad to see you!
Hey, is this astronaut camp?

03:58.799 --> 04:01.280
No, Scoot. It's an amusement park.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.280
You must have taken a wrong turn.

04:03.560 --> 04:07.040
Again? Oh, no! I'm gonna be late!

04:07.519 --> 04:09.600
I'm supposed to be at astronaut camp

04:09.760 --> 04:12.679
learning how to go to space in a rocket!

04:12.839 --> 04:15.799
Astronaut camp?
You can't be late for that!

04:16.120 --> 04:19.000
We're just gonna have to drop
everything and get you there.

04:19.159 --> 04:23.560
But, Ollie, the ride!
Can't we just loan Scoot a map?

04:23.719 --> 04:26.360
It was a map that got me into this mess.

04:26.520 --> 04:30.440
It was a map that got him
into this mess, Moon! No!

04:30.599 --> 04:34.200
We have no choice but to take
Scoot where he's going,

04:34.360 --> 04:35.960
no matter how far it is.

04:36.120 --> 04:36.960
But...

04:37.080 --> 04:39.479
we're still playing ask or adventure!

04:39.640 --> 04:42.479
-So we have to make it fast!
-Fast?

04:42.640 --> 04:45.080
I think I can help with that!

04:46.599 --> 04:49.800
How do you like my new
all-terrain motorcycle?

04:49.960 --> 04:51.800
It can go super fast!

04:51.919 --> 04:53.719
Whee!

04:53.840 --> 04:55.960
And it can go super slow!

04:56.880 --> 04:58.080
Ah...

04:59.599 --> 05:00.680
Turn there!

05:01.200 --> 05:06.240
And my personal favourite,
bumpety, bumpety, bumpety!

05:08.719 --> 05:10.240
Stop!

05:11.200 --> 05:13.400
Whoa!

05:16.680 --> 05:17.800
Where are we?

05:17.960 --> 05:20.360
Looks like a swamp!

05:20.520 --> 05:23.280
Say, this isn't astronaut camp!

05:23.440 --> 05:24.680
-Wow!
-Don't worry.

05:25.159 --> 05:26.320
We're just taking a shortcut

05:26.479 --> 05:29.880
through this lovely
Florida swamp. Listen!

05:30.200 --> 05:32.320
It's so nice and quiet here.

05:32.479 --> 05:34.080
[engine roars]

05:34.200 --> 05:36.280
At least it was quiet!

05:39.159 --> 05:42.599
Don't you love this swamp boat? Woohoo!

05:42.800 --> 05:45.599
Actually, it makes me miss
your motorcycle!

05:48.760 --> 05:50.840
-Hi, alligator!
-Alligator?

05:51.680 --> 05:54.200
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but can we go faster?

05:55.800 --> 05:57.599
Bye, alligator!

06:05.159 --> 06:08.599
-OK. We're here.
-And just in time.

06:09.400 --> 06:11.680
Wow!

06:11.800 --> 06:13.599
Thanks for the adventure, you guys!

06:13.760 --> 06:17.760
Now for my own adventure
at astronaut camp.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.159
Ooh, I can't wait to see what it's like

06:20.320 --> 06:23.680
to be a space explorer! Woohoo!

06:23.840 --> 06:27.080
Say, you guys wanna join me?

06:27.240 --> 06:29.799
On an astronaut-camp adventure?

06:29.960 --> 06:33.400
-We'd love to!
-Huh? No, we wouldn't!

06:33.560 --> 06:36.000
Oh, right! We can't.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.479
We're in the middle
of our Ask or Adventure game

06:38.640 --> 06:40.960
and Ollie still has a coaster to ride!

06:41.120 --> 06:42.599
Right, Ollie?

06:42.880 --> 06:44.359
Ollie?

06:44.520 --> 06:46.359
OK then, so long!

06:48.400 --> 06:50.719
Ollie! Where'd you go?

06:52.880 --> 06:55.840
<i>Please step back from secured area.</i>

06:58.280 --> 07:01.560
<i>Please step back from secured area.</i>

07:02.560 --> 07:03.760
-Huh?
-<i>Um.</i>

07:03.919 --> 07:07.760
<i>You're still in the secured area.</i>

07:11.080 --> 07:11.919
[sighs]

07:12.039 --> 07:13.320
<i>Still there.</i>

07:13.479 --> 07:15.719
I'm just trying to find my friend!

07:15.880 --> 07:19.719
<i>Oh. He's hiding in the flight suits.</i>

07:19.880 --> 07:22.039
Ollie? What are you doing there?

07:22.320 --> 07:24.120
Are you really hiding?

07:24.280 --> 07:27.400
Moon, the truth is
I was afraid of the coaster.

07:27.560 --> 07:30.760
I thought if we took
a long time getting Scoot here,

07:30.919 --> 07:32.440
we'd not have time to ride it.

07:32.560 --> 07:33.840
Aw, Ollie...

07:33.960 --> 07:37.120
I guess I'm just not the adventure type.

07:37.280 --> 07:40.640
But I really didn't want
to disappoint you, so...

07:40.799 --> 07:42.799
-<i>Next!</i>
-Whoa!

07:42.960 --> 07:44.919
What is this place, anyway?

07:45.080 --> 07:47.400
<i>It's our jet-pack training school.</i>

07:48.479 --> 07:51.440
Aaah!

07:52.400 --> 07:55.560
Is that Ollie in a jet pack?

07:55.719 --> 07:57.039
What?

07:59.719 --> 08:02.280
Whoo! Go, Ollie!

08:06.359 --> 08:09.799
Woo-hoo-hoo! Isn't it great, Ollie?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.120
<i>Moon to Ollie, do you read me?</i>

08:14.599 --> 08:15.560
<i>Moon!</i>

08:15.719 --> 08:18.599
<i>It's so quiet and peaceful up here.</i>

08:19.679 --> 08:21.320
<i>And I can see the coaster!</i>

08:22.039 --> 08:24.280
It seems so teeny now!

08:24.679 --> 08:26.960
-<i>It does?</i>
-<i>Yeah! You know,</i>

08:27.120 --> 08:29.039
<i>after everything I did today,</i>

08:29.200 --> 08:32.679
<i>motorcycles, alligators, jetpacks...</i>

08:32.799 --> 08:34.480
<i>I'm not afraid any more!</i>

08:34.640 --> 08:36.559
<i>Thank you for getting me into this, Moon.</i>

08:36.679 --> 08:40.319
<i>I just got us here, Ollie.</i>
<i>You did all the adventuring.</i>

08:41.959 --> 08:44.520
<i>You're doing great, jet-pack trainee.</i>

08:44.640 --> 08:46.680
<i>The computer will bring you down now.</i>

08:54.280 --> 08:56.920
That was amazing!

08:57.079 --> 08:58.280
And I'm ready for more!

08:58.439 --> 09:01.840
Let's go ride
that roller coaster! Woohoo!

09:11.959 --> 09:14.199
Wait, it goes upside down?

09:14.360 --> 09:15.839
Did you know it went upside down?

09:15.959 --> 09:18.760
-No, but it looks fun!
-You know,

09:18.920 --> 09:21.079
we've already had such a full day.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.720
I'm not sure
I even need to ride any more.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.040
-But...
-Also my tummy might get woozy

09:26.160 --> 09:28.280
after all the lemonade I've had today.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.720
But you haven't had any lemonade.

09:30.839 --> 09:32.720
[slurps]

09:33.199 --> 09:36.520
Hang on. We need to play
Ask or Adventure again.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.000
And this time you get ask.

09:39.959 --> 09:42.640
Are you really worried about your tummy?

09:42.839 --> 09:46.319
The truth is, Ollie,
I'm scared to go upside down.

09:46.439 --> 09:48.600
It's OK to be scared, Moon.

09:48.760 --> 09:52.560
Tell you what. I'll ride it
and tell you all about it!

09:53.240 --> 09:55.480
But... You know what, Ollie?

09:55.600 --> 09:59.680
Maybe I could do it, if you held my hand.

09:59.839 --> 10:02.880
You got it, Moon!
We're gonna have the best time!
