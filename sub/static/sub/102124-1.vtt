M_I_SForEver

01:25.474 --> 01:27.878
Sir. Um...

01:33.415 --> 01:34.450
- Sir...
- Master Keegan,

01:34.483 --> 01:35.484
this is a letter
to your parents

01:35.519 --> 01:38.322
explaining the circumstances
of your suspension.

01:42.992 --> 01:44.060
That's mental.

01:44.093 --> 01:45.528
<i>You're</i> mental.

01:45.561 --> 01:48.097
You disrupted
an entire block during class.

01:48.131 --> 01:51.736
You absolutely
terrified Mrs. Stapleton.

01:53.036 --> 01:55.004
OK. Well, I'm glad
I got this opportunity

01:55.037 --> 01:56.140
to tell my side of the story.

01:56.173 --> 01:57.507
There is no story.

01:57.540 --> 01:59.009
I disagree.

01:59.042 --> 02:00.277
I think there is a story.

02:00.310 --> 02:02.780
I think there's a story
of when a faculty

02:02.813 --> 02:04.882
repeatedly hands out
detentions to students

02:04.915 --> 02:07.084
for sitting on top
of dangerous lockers

02:07.117 --> 02:08.919
that could fall over
at any moment,

02:08.951 --> 02:12.121
when actually it's a health
and safety management issue,

02:12.155 --> 02:14.191
and if you just screwed
the lockers to the walls,

02:14.223 --> 02:16.859
they wouldn't be dangerous,
but you don't.

02:16.893 --> 02:20.163
And I think it's because you're
worried about reducing the value

02:20.197 --> 02:22.064
of your grade-whatever
listed building,

02:22.098 --> 02:24.067
that one day you'll probably
sell for billions

02:24.099 --> 02:27.037
and then divide that amongst
the shareholders.

02:34.978 --> 02:36.980
That is the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

02:37.013 --> 02:38.816
You haven't been
in Mrs. Stapleton's class.

02:38.848 --> 02:41.584
You don't give a toss
about the lockers, Lee.

02:41.617 --> 02:46.556
You just like to cause trouble.
It's childish.

02:46.590 --> 02:51.594
This is St. Mark's. We don't
indulge children, we make men.

02:51.627 --> 02:54.530
You of all people
should appreciate that.

02:54.563 --> 02:57.334
A scholarship here is rare, Lee.

02:57.366 --> 03:00.304
Very rare.

03:00.336 --> 03:02.906
You don't realize
how lucky you are.

03:03.573 --> 03:05.975
Hopefully you will now.

03:27.597 --> 03:28.998
Come in.

03:31.501 --> 03:34.905
Yes, Mr. Bates?

03:41.944 --> 03:44.614
Keegan's bag, Headmaster.

03:44.647 --> 03:46.383
Thank you.

03:50.020 --> 03:51.322
Is there something else?

04:08.371 --> 04:09.939
Oh, Lee.

04:12.342 --> 04:14.478
You planted that?

05:17.607 --> 05:18.709
Lee.

05:18.742 --> 05:20.544
Where are you going?

05:21.610 --> 05:24.647
Home. For good this time.

05:29.319 --> 05:30.621
No.

05:36.158 --> 05:36.992
That's mental.

05:37.026 --> 05:39.362
Yeah, it wasn't
for the prank, either.

05:39.396 --> 05:40.764
Oh, and if you want
your weed back,

05:40.797 --> 05:44.067
you'll have to go and have
a chat with the Headmaster.

05:44.100 --> 05:47.371
- Zero tolerance policy.
- Lee. Get in.

05:47.403 --> 05:49.673
Wait, wait, wait.
I can do something.

05:49.706 --> 05:52.275
- Maybe if I talk to him...
- He won't want you involved.

05:52.307 --> 05:53.576
Lee!

05:54.543 --> 05:56.180
Wait.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.795
I'm sorry, Dad.

06:47.564 --> 06:49.099
Why?

06:51.468 --> 06:55.539
Well, I'm just sorry you had
to come and pick me up.

06:55.572 --> 06:57.473
It's not your fault, is it?

07:02.112 --> 07:04.814
Bell ends!

07:08.550 --> 07:09.819
I'm...

07:09.853 --> 07:12.790
I mean, no, it's not my fault.

07:14.423 --> 07:15.625
Thanks.

07:15.658 --> 07:18.694
There's no need to thank me.
I wasn't gonna leave you there.

07:38.915 --> 07:40.784
They said I had
to show you this.

07:40.817 --> 07:42.218
Shh! Shh!

07:42.252 --> 07:43.287
<i>That's all very well,</i>

07:43.319 --> 07:44.887
<i>but the question
people are asking me</i>

07:44.920 --> 07:46.522
<i>is, are we closing
the borders?</i>

07:46.555 --> 07:48.557
<i>We're looking
at all options and...</i>

07:48.591 --> 07:51.495
<i>It's a yes or no
question, Minister. Yes or no?</i>

07:51.528 --> 07:54.131
<i>The situation is
obviously developing very fast.</i>

07:54.163 --> 07:56.233
<i>Borders, yes or no?</i>

07:56.266 --> 07:57.401
<i>That's not the way</i>

07:57.434 --> 07:58.602
<i>we've ever responded
to a pandemic, and...</i>

07:58.634 --> 08:00.704
<i>Are we going
to quarantine the country?</i>

08:00.737 --> 08:02.039
<i>If you won't let me answer...</i>

08:02.072 --> 08:04.774
<i>Two weeks ago, Minister,
there were people dropping dead</i>

08:04.807 --> 08:05.942
<i>in Europe, two weeks ago.</i>

08:05.975 --> 08:07.844
<i>Since
the first reported cases...</i>

08:07.877 --> 08:09.846
<i>What would you
suggest, then, Minister?</i>

08:11.247 --> 08:12.782
Jesus,
bloody government.

08:17.420 --> 08:19.523
<i>Could this be
a terrorist act?</i>

08:21.190 --> 08:23.926
<i>Why can't you just say
"closing the borders"?</i>

08:24.995 --> 08:26.762
<i>I wish you would answer
a question.</i>

08:26.795 --> 08:29.598
<i>How about my first one?
Borders, yes or no?</i>

08:29.632 --> 08:32.434
<i>I mean, when we
look at various precedents...</i>

08:33.503 --> 08:35.538
What was it you wanted
to show me?

08:37.407 --> 08:38.642
Um...

08:40.243 --> 08:42.546
Nothing, really.

08:42.578 --> 08:46.448
Just a, uh, video
with a cute cat.

08:46.481 --> 08:49.285
I don't think your mum's
coming home this summer, Lee.

09:56.552 --> 09:59.956
- Mum?
- <i>Lee! Thank God.</i>

09:59.989 --> 10:02.524
<i>Lee. Are you OK?</i>

10:02.557 --> 10:03.960
He's really bad, Mum.

10:03.993 --> 10:06.797
<i>Lee, listen to me.</i>

10:07.929 --> 10:10.366
<i>You can't catch it.</i>

10:10.399 --> 10:12.701
<i>Understand?</i>

10:12.735 --> 10:15.004
<i>You don't need to be scared
anymore, love.</i>

10:15.038 --> 10:17.474
<i>You're gonna be OK.</i>

10:17.506 --> 10:20.376
And... what about Dad?

10:24.313 --> 10:25.848
<i>There's no cure.</i>

10:28.750 --> 10:31.687
<i>Lee? Baby.</i>

10:31.721 --> 10:36.826
<i>It's your blood.
You're O negative.</i>

10:36.859 --> 10:39.963
<i>Only O negatives are immune.</i>

10:39.995 --> 10:44.567
<i>It's rare.
You get that from me.</i>

10:49.339 --> 10:51.008
<i>I'm so sorry, Lee.</i>

10:53.975 --> 10:55.745
<i>Your dad is gonna die.</i>

12:12.922 --> 12:14.691
Please don't hate me.

12:49.692 --> 12:52.995
<i>You can't be alone, Lee.</i>

12:53.028 --> 12:56.064
<i>You have to be somewhere safe,
with people you trust.</i>

12:57.933 --> 12:59.968
Seems fine here.

13:00.001 --> 13:04.807
<i>What about school? Lee?
St. Mark's.</i>

13:04.841 --> 13:07.177
I, uh...
I can't go back there.

13:07.210 --> 13:08.778
<i>Why not?</i>

13:10.712 --> 13:13.515
Just the people, you know?
They're just...

13:13.548 --> 13:15.951
<i>Come on, it isn't the time,
Lee.</i>

13:15.985 --> 13:17.954
<i>Go to St. Mark's.</i>

13:18.888 --> 13:20.123
<i>I'm not asking.</i>

13:51.520 --> 13:53.689
Hello?

14:14.210 --> 14:17.881
This is occupied.

14:31.326 --> 14:34.062
Shit.

14:34.096 --> 14:35.163
Oh, shit!

14:35.197 --> 14:37.767
Shit, shit, shit!

14:37.799 --> 14:40.269
Come on! Come on!

14:42.837 --> 14:44.873
Come on!

14:48.311 --> 14:50.179
I'm gonna have you now!

14:50.211 --> 14:52.915
I'll fuckin' have you now,
you bastard!

15:15.804 --> 15:17.039
<i>For once, Lee,</i>

15:17.072 --> 15:19.608
<i>for once just do
what I tell you.</i>

15:19.642 --> 15:22.845
<i>Will you go to St. Mark's?
Wait for me there.</i>

15:22.878 --> 15:23.946
<i>Just wait for me.</i>

15:23.979 --> 15:27.984
<i>I'll get home, I promise.
And, Lee...</i>

15:29.150 --> 15:30.753
<i>Be a good boy.</i>

16:40.690 --> 16:42.959
Hello?

16:54.102 --> 16:55.303
Hello?

17:12.121 --> 17:14.123
Hello? Sir?

17:40.281 --> 17:42.884
Oh!

18:20.823 --> 18:25.495
Sorry, sir.

19:02.597 --> 19:04.933
Help.

19:37.365 --> 19:39.301
Hello, Lee.

19:41.569 --> 19:43.873
Hello, Nurse.

19:43.905 --> 19:45.841
It's Matron now, thank you.

19:59.421 --> 20:01.524
- Prick.
- Sorry?

20:01.557 --> 20:02.892
Such a waste.

20:02.924 --> 20:05.094
We didn't even know
he was still here.

20:06.996 --> 20:08.598
Matron died and he just...

20:09.498 --> 20:11.100
took off his ring...

20:12.334 --> 20:14.903
and never said a word about it.

20:14.936 --> 20:17.005
But he must
have really missed her.

20:20.308 --> 20:23.980
Funny, he was always such
a pervert when she was around.

20:25.114 --> 20:27.048
We?

20:27.082 --> 20:29.319
Well, it's not just you
and me, Lee.

20:56.711 --> 21:00.348
B3 to 5-7, or we can go

21:00.382 --> 21:05.187
B32, B3-4-5, B5-5-4.

21:05.220 --> 21:06.288
Used to be a nightmare,

21:06.321 --> 21:08.256
but it's obviously
pretty clear now.

21:08.289 --> 21:12.028
Anyway, we are going
to take the lesser routes,

21:12.060 --> 21:15.597
because the main roads
will be blocked or dangerous.

21:15.631 --> 21:20.403
I will take this, just in case.

21:20.435 --> 21:25.040
I am the only one
to handle it, understood?

21:28.676 --> 21:30.646
Lee Keegan.

21:32.381 --> 21:35.051
Sir.

21:35.084 --> 21:37.987
You're on probation.

21:41.690 --> 21:46.162
OK, remember, we're looking
for food with a long shelf life.

21:46.194 --> 21:47.562
That's packaged goods.

21:47.596 --> 21:49.597
So, forget organic,
forget fresh.

21:49.631 --> 21:51.968
It's the opposite of everything
you've been taught in food tech.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.237
And I suggest we go out in...

21:55.269 --> 21:56.571
Yes, Lee?

21:56.605 --> 21:58.641
Sorry, sir, it's just,

21:58.673 --> 22:02.310
how do we know there's
anything left at Tesco?

22:02.344 --> 22:05.213
It's just that
it's pretty mad out there.

22:05.247 --> 22:06.716
I passed a few shops
on the way here

22:06.749 --> 22:07.884
and they were empty already.

22:07.916 --> 22:11.553
And Tesco's is, like, the first
place you'd go to, so...

22:11.586 --> 22:15.758
Well, we have to try, Lee.

22:15.790 --> 22:17.492
Every little helps.

22:19.127 --> 22:21.029
Mac.

22:21.063 --> 22:23.432
You are vice-cap
on this mission.

22:23.464 --> 22:26.434
Keep up the rear
and keep everyone together.

22:26.468 --> 22:29.138
- Lee's short third man.
- I don't know what that means.

22:29.171 --> 22:31.507
It means get on the team, man.

22:31.539 --> 22:33.209
Exactly.

22:33.241 --> 22:36.077
Now, boys, I know,
I know it's been tough.

22:36.111 --> 22:41.250
But we have everything
we need here.

22:41.282 --> 22:43.251
You may not feel it now,
but this old place

22:43.285 --> 22:46.022
is still giving you all
a head start.

22:46.055 --> 22:47.523
Help us!

22:47.556 --> 22:49.625
- Help us!
- Mr. Hammond?

22:49.657 --> 22:50.759
Someone's coming.

22:50.792 --> 22:53.028
Jane, please,
you need to hide us.

22:53.061 --> 22:54.262
Calm down, Mr. Hammond.

22:54.296 --> 22:55.664
Help us, Ken!

22:58.834 --> 23:00.336
Lock it.

23:21.722 --> 23:23.392
Sir, do you have the key?

23:23.424 --> 23:26.128
Sir!

23:35.269 --> 23:39.508
We, uh, will need
to... to take the B roads.

23:41.576 --> 23:44.613
We're looking for any food
with a good shelf life, really.

23:44.645 --> 23:46.615
Um...

23:46.647 --> 23:49.684
We need to stay strong.

23:49.718 --> 23:51.254
Stay together.

23:54.288 --> 23:56.491
I think this is gonna be
a good challenge

23:56.525 --> 23:57.660
for us all to overcome.

24:09.538 --> 24:10.772
Where are they?

24:13.909 --> 24:17.580
- Where are they?
- Who?

24:17.613 --> 24:20.182
- Are you in charge here?
- I'm in charge.

24:21.650 --> 24:23.119
Who are you?

24:23.919 --> 24:26.288
I represent Worham Town,

24:26.320 --> 24:29.658
and the authority
of Georgina Baker...

24:33.795 --> 24:39.634
former magistrate and mayor
of Worham Parish Council.

24:39.667 --> 24:41.436
You're from the Parish Council?

24:41.470 --> 24:43.672
Yes.

24:43.704 --> 24:47.409
Actually St. Mark's falls
within the parish borders.

24:49.243 --> 24:50.779
Did you know that?

24:52.480 --> 24:54.650
Are you...

24:54.682 --> 24:56.652
Are you trying to frighten us?

24:58.420 --> 24:59.721
A bit.

25:02.324 --> 25:04.894
The two people
you're hiding are thieves.

25:04.926 --> 25:07.163
They stole from Worham Town.

25:07.195 --> 25:08.630
Are you serious?

25:08.663 --> 25:11.333
We have to enforce
the rule of law.

25:11.365 --> 25:12.535
In case you hadn't noticed,

25:12.567 --> 25:15.703
there's no one left
to do that around here.

25:15.737 --> 25:18.807
It's about the message,
you know?

25:19.942 --> 25:21.743
And what will happen to them?

25:24.579 --> 25:26.182
They'll be fine.

25:28.784 --> 25:31.653
I just need you
to hand them over.

25:33.422 --> 25:35.857
Would you open this, please?

25:35.891 --> 25:37.426
There's nothing in there.

25:37.459 --> 25:39.327
Nevertheless.

25:39.361 --> 25:40.930
It's a cleaning cupboard.

25:42.297 --> 25:43.900
We don't have the key.

25:45.534 --> 25:48.437
And there's nothing in there.

25:52.540 --> 25:53.875
OK.

25:58.980 --> 26:00.348
Then this won't matter.

26:00.382 --> 26:03.451
Run! Run!

26:03.852 --> 26:04.787
Run!

26:06.320 --> 26:07.622
Howzat!

26:08.856 --> 26:10.660
Lee!

26:26.775 --> 26:28.678
Mac!

26:42.990 --> 26:45.760
Oh, God. Oh, God.

27:26.701 --> 27:28.971
Is everybody OK?

27:29.003 --> 27:31.506
Ken. The keys.

27:31.539 --> 27:34.009
The keys?

28:05.840 --> 28:08.576
Oh, Jesus Christ.

28:09.711 --> 28:11.947
Tie her up with something.

28:11.980 --> 28:14.750
Is Mr. Hammond going to die?

28:14.782 --> 28:17.519
This isn't a hospital.
We can keep it clean, drain it.

28:17.551 --> 28:18.820
But we don't have the drugs
for infection

28:18.854 --> 28:20.556
and we definitely
don't have any blood.

28:20.588 --> 28:22.624
- You mean like a transfusion?
- Yeah.

28:22.656 --> 28:23.625
Well, can we use ours?

28:23.657 --> 28:25.626
That's not how it works, Lee.
There are types.

28:25.660 --> 28:27.396
If you'd paid attention
in class...

28:27.429 --> 28:28.964
- Mac, what blood type are you?
- No idea, mate.

28:28.997 --> 28:30.666
Great, thanks.
Matron, what blood type are you?

28:30.699 --> 28:31.866
- O negative.
- Sir?

28:31.900 --> 28:33.669
- Same.
- We all are.

28:33.701 --> 28:34.836
That's the only reason
we're alive.

28:34.869 --> 28:37.739
- That means Hammond is too.
- <i>Mister</i> Hammond.

28:38.740 --> 28:41.743
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

28:41.777 --> 28:45.114
OK. OK, there's a GP surgery
near Dunroamin.

28:45.146 --> 28:46.781
They might have some
antibiotics.

28:46.815 --> 28:48.150
- Can you go first thing?
- Yes.

28:48.182 --> 28:49.884
Will this do, sir?

29:01.596 --> 29:02.998
Rowles.

29:03.865 --> 29:05.968
What happened in Worham?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.836
Did you really take something?

29:09.136 --> 29:11.005
What did you take?

29:11.038 --> 29:12.907
A tin of beans.

29:18.113 --> 29:19.849
And a Dino.

29:25.619 --> 29:27.989
Maybe we should keep the gate
locked from now on, huh?

29:34.195 --> 29:36.030
<i>"Do we still
hear nothing</i>

29:36.064 --> 29:37.599
of the noise
of the grave diggers

29:37.632 --> 29:38.901
who are burying God?"

29:38.933 --> 29:41.170
"Gods, too, decompose."

29:41.202 --> 29:46.008
"God is dead, God remains dead,
and we have killed him."

29:46.040 --> 29:49.677
I don't believe in God, anyway,
so it's not a problem.

29:56.017 --> 29:57.052
You all right?

29:57.085 --> 29:59.087
Contextually, yeah.

30:00.654 --> 30:02.458
- Thank you.
- You smashed it.

30:02.490 --> 30:03.759
You're welcome.

30:06.161 --> 30:07.663
Whoa.

30:08.864 --> 30:10.598
What now?

30:10.632 --> 30:12.902
- The body.
- Bodies.

30:13.902 --> 30:15.638
And a dog.

30:16.770 --> 30:21.476
The Headmaster. And Archie.

30:21.509 --> 30:24.012
I'm sorry,
I'm not doing that again.

30:25.012 --> 30:26.481
Dad.

30:28.983 --> 30:31.820
OK. So we're on dinner.

30:33.221 --> 30:34.890
Come on, you lot.

30:42.130 --> 30:44.533
Do you reckon there's like
a safety on this or what?

31:04.152 --> 31:06.822
Oh, Chef, you legend.

31:44.125 --> 31:45.794
Grub's up.

31:52.834 --> 31:54.102
Lights out in ten.

32:12.386 --> 32:13.855
It's OK.

32:15.624 --> 32:17.192
Set it down over there.

32:28.236 --> 32:29.939
And thanks for your help, Lee.

32:32.807 --> 32:34.977
Keep helping, will you?

32:43.917 --> 32:46.654
Ooh, that's sore.

33:08.876 --> 33:10.177
Lights out!

33:29.998 --> 33:31.634
Lee?

33:33.233 --> 33:35.103
Yeah?

33:37.905 --> 33:39.974
I killed someone today.

33:45.779 --> 33:47.649
You had to.

34:31.492 --> 34:33.728
Let's go get some drugs.

34:44.204 --> 34:46.208
What?

34:46.239 --> 34:47.275
You drive, right?

34:47.306 --> 34:49.478
I don't have a license yet.

34:49.510 --> 34:51.179
I think that's OK.

35:13.867 --> 35:15.436
Oh.

35:22.010 --> 35:23.846
Why don't we do a little recon?

35:36.356 --> 35:37.958
Stay low. Stay low.

35:37.992 --> 35:39.294
What's...

35:42.030 --> 35:43.865
Where'd that come from?

35:43.898 --> 35:45.967
Bates.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.436
Bates's room.

35:54.541 --> 35:55.442
Where do they get
the guns?

35:58.612 --> 36:00.214
It's not military.

36:02.382 --> 36:04.051
Just farmers
and hunters, I guess.

36:04.085 --> 36:05.987
We need to find us a farmer.

36:07.322 --> 36:09.157
Come on.

36:09.190 --> 36:11.025
Let's get the hell
out of this parish, shall we?

36:36.550 --> 36:39.320
Miss. Miss, what is it?
What is it?

36:39.353 --> 36:41.589
OK, you need to calm down.

36:41.623 --> 36:44.159
You need to calm down
and tell me what is it?

36:44.192 --> 36:45.260
What is it?

36:45.293 --> 36:47.262
I can't move.

36:47.295 --> 36:49.097
You're taped to the chair.

36:49.130 --> 36:51.465
No. I can't move.

36:51.498 --> 36:53.568
I can't move anything!

37:13.253 --> 37:16.458
Right.
Get medicine, be heroes.

37:26.400 --> 37:29.103
It's quite nice
outside of school, innit?

37:29.137 --> 37:32.274
Yes, dickhead, there's actually
people and everything.

37:34.275 --> 37:36.077
I mean, there <i>were</i> people.

37:38.445 --> 37:40.181
Not round here, though.

37:41.682 --> 37:45.320
This is all just holiday homes
for people like you.

37:45.954 --> 37:47.389
The man.

37:47.422 --> 37:49.590
City money.

37:49.623 --> 37:51.492
Gutting the rural heart
of Britain

37:51.525 --> 37:54.995
with empty mansions that
just sit here and do nothing.

37:55.028 --> 37:57.298
I mean, what is the point?

37:57.699 --> 37:59.134
Empty.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.277
Hello?

38:14.114 --> 38:15.616
Whee-yaaaa!

38:18.353 --> 38:19.688
Yes, lad!

38:26.059 --> 38:27.362
Hello?

38:43.777 --> 38:46.146
I can... Hold on.

39:03.197 --> 39:04.432
Whoo!

39:39.766 --> 39:41.301
That was shit.

39:41.335 --> 39:43.070
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

40:12.099 --> 40:13.500
Well, that's good.

40:13.534 --> 40:17.572
OK, O-neg nominations.

40:17.605 --> 40:20.507
You choose five people that turn
out to have had O-neg blood,

40:20.541 --> 40:23.278
and you get to start the world
with them again.

40:23.311 --> 40:24.412
Uh, Winston Churchill.

40:24.445 --> 40:27.481
They have to be alive
at the time of the virus.

40:28.748 --> 40:30.684
Um... Bates?

40:30.717 --> 40:33.620
Just to annoy you.

40:33.653 --> 40:36.423
You know
his wife left him?

40:36.456 --> 40:40.260
- OK...
- After the virus hit.

40:40.293 --> 40:42.096
Just took their daughter
and ran.

40:42.663 --> 40:44.099
Brutal.

40:46.300 --> 40:48.336
Tells you something, though,
doesn't it?

40:51.271 --> 40:53.574
- You take the left.
- OK.

40:54.574 --> 40:56.210
Who would you pick?

40:56.244 --> 40:57.479
You'd want a doctor.

40:57.512 --> 41:00.815
A real one, not Matron.

41:00.847 --> 41:03.684
Seems like you'd probably need
a good military leader as well.

41:05.652 --> 41:06.887
You'd want
some good all-rounders

41:06.920 --> 41:10.591
in terms of, like, rebuilding.
Bear Grylls?

41:10.625 --> 41:13.293
That'd be all right,
Bear Grylls, yeah.

41:13.327 --> 41:16.431
Ariana Grande. Definitely.

41:16.463 --> 41:18.398
You know, cos of...

41:18.431 --> 41:21.635
her understanding
of infrastructure.

41:50.364 --> 41:51.632
Mac!

42:05.478 --> 42:08.315
I know what you're thinking.

42:08.349 --> 42:10.452
It looks like shit
when it's dry.

42:11.585 --> 42:13.687
That's not what I was thinking.

42:13.721 --> 42:16.590
It's the blood.
The blood is the life.

42:16.623 --> 42:19.360
Yeah. We know.

42:20.827 --> 42:22.630
Can you let
my friend go, please?

42:22.663 --> 42:25.699
No. You made a right mess
of it in here.

42:25.733 --> 42:26.901
I'm sorry.

42:26.934 --> 42:28.736
This is NHS property.

42:28.768 --> 42:31.338
- Please, please!
- Shhhh!

42:31.371 --> 42:33.574
Please, don't! Just, just...

42:33.608 --> 42:36.644
Wait, we'll put everything back
where it was, OK?

42:36.677 --> 42:41.583
And I can tell you where there's
a whole school full of people

42:41.615 --> 42:43.483
with the blood and everything.

42:43.516 --> 42:46.887
And we can just... tell me what
you want me to do, please.

42:46.920 --> 42:49.223
- Wait your turn!
- No, no, no, no!

43:14.047 --> 43:15.616
Filthy fucking...

43:15.650 --> 43:17.418
Whoa, Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac!

43:17.451 --> 43:19.753
- Fuck off!
- Mac, it's over, it's done.

43:19.786 --> 43:21.521
- Fuck off!
- It's done.

43:21.554 --> 43:23.891
Fuck off! Fuck off, you nut!

43:33.601 --> 43:37.005
Here, mate.
Have a wet wipe.

43:40.373 --> 43:41.775
Hello?

43:43.476 --> 43:44.913
Hi.

43:46.447 --> 43:48.682
How do we know
you won't shoot us?

43:50.050 --> 43:52.019
Because I haven't yet.

44:15.809 --> 44:17.344
Where are you boys from?

44:21.782 --> 44:23.451
Nowhere, really.

44:25.485 --> 44:27.922
Quite a hoard
you've got here.

44:34.795 --> 44:37.731
It's just, um, stuff
we travel with, you know?

44:37.764 --> 44:39.933
Hmm.

44:39.967 --> 44:42.603
I'm Georgina.

44:42.635 --> 44:44.771
Georgina Baker.

44:44.804 --> 44:46.373
Right, cool.

44:46.407 --> 44:49.577
Well, um...
thanks for your help.

44:49.610 --> 44:52.681
We're looking for my daughter.

44:55.148 --> 44:57.018
Have you seen her?

44:58.885 --> 45:00.454
No.

45:02.123 --> 45:04.625
Nope.

45:04.657 --> 45:08.395
She was last seen pursuing
a criminal fraternity

45:08.429 --> 45:10.865
back near the parish border.

45:10.898 --> 45:11.966
If you do see her...

45:11.998 --> 45:15.402
We will bring her straight
to Worham.

45:15.436 --> 45:18.807
Thank you, boys. Please do.

45:21.175 --> 45:23.111
You can keep this.

45:25.913 --> 45:27.414
Nice school, that.

45:29.150 --> 45:30.617
Thanks?

45:37.425 --> 45:40.428
Now <i>he</i> is military.

45:44.532 --> 45:45.900
Stupid girl.

45:45.932 --> 45:47.601
Even the simplest thing is...

45:47.635 --> 45:50.772
Did we say "Worham"
at any point?

45:52.706 --> 45:54.409
No.

45:55.443 --> 45:57.479
We did not.

46:13.092 --> 46:15.562
Where the hell have you been?

46:15.596 --> 46:18.032
- New arrivals.
- All right, Wolf?

46:18.065 --> 46:19.501
It's been better.

46:20.701 --> 46:22.536
Patel, right?

46:22.570 --> 46:25.173
- I'm Mac.
- Yeah, I know.

46:25.206 --> 46:26.908
You once made me drink
three pints of milk.

46:26.940 --> 46:28.576
You guys must have been
through a lot.

46:28.943 --> 46:30.145
Come in.

46:33.514 --> 46:35.884
Yeah, but you're
still bloody idiots.

46:37.150 --> 46:38.485
These are for you.

46:38.518 --> 46:40.587
Oh, Jesus.

46:42.155 --> 46:44.625
Well, at least you didn't
get into trouble.

46:44.657 --> 46:46.460
Um, well, actually,

46:46.494 --> 46:49.597
there's something we need
to tell you about our captive.

46:49.630 --> 46:50.832
Really?

46:52.632 --> 46:54.902
I was going to say
the same thing to you.

47:04.911 --> 47:06.146
Right.

47:06.780 --> 47:08.048
Right.

47:09.650 --> 47:12.019
Yeah, they've got a pretty
impressive setup too.

47:12.052 --> 47:13.621
Here, you can, um...

47:16.757 --> 47:20.561
- Oh. It's broken.
- Great. Thanks.

47:20.594 --> 47:23.231
Well, I suppose
we have to give her back.

47:23.264 --> 47:26.733
What, and just say she was
like that when we found her?

47:28.101 --> 47:29.636
Can you do anything?

47:29.670 --> 47:33.074
- Her spine is broken.
- So no?

47:33.106 --> 47:35.076
We've got a lot of space here.

47:35.108 --> 47:38.045
OK? We just keep her,
like, hidden.

47:38.077 --> 47:39.480
Forever?

47:40.581 --> 47:42.550
Forever?

47:42.583 --> 47:44.585
Feeding another mouth?

47:44.617 --> 47:46.586
- Cleaning her up?
- Mac.

47:46.619 --> 47:48.522
Only until things
get back to normal.

47:48.556 --> 47:49.856
Can everyone please
stop pretending

47:49.889 --> 47:51.859
that things are going
back to normal?

47:56.597 --> 47:59.066
Look...

47:59.099 --> 48:01.603
I hate to be the one
to say it, but...

48:03.237 --> 48:05.773
there is
an obvious solution here.

48:14.815 --> 48:17.751
I don't like it at all, but...

48:17.784 --> 48:21.888
I mean, we can't send her back.
We can't keep her here.

48:21.922 --> 48:24.559
What if she... disappeared?

48:24.592 --> 48:27.827
Jesus bloody wept!

48:27.860 --> 48:28.961
I'm just saying.

48:28.996 --> 48:31.566
A million things could have
happened to her out there.

48:31.599 --> 48:34.869
Enough, Sean! We are not
having this conversation.

48:34.902 --> 48:39.307
Not in this school.
Your father was an MP.

48:41.809 --> 48:43.111
He'd be ashamed.

48:47.380 --> 48:49.182
Oh, you think so?

49:20.914 --> 49:23.585
<i>Mum died years ago.</i>

49:24.652 --> 49:25.853
Cancer.

49:27.755 --> 49:29.123
Dad...

49:29.989 --> 49:32.158
three weeks.

49:32.192 --> 49:34.128
They said he'd call, but...

49:44.304 --> 49:46.206
Both OK, I think.

49:46.239 --> 49:49.209
But... they're in Mumbai, so...

49:55.983 --> 49:58.285
I honestly have no idea.

49:58.318 --> 50:00.722
Fuckers were in Bermuda
when it hit.

50:06.460 --> 50:07.894
Um...

50:09.028 --> 50:10.398
Mum's coming.

50:12.965 --> 50:15.201
To absent parents.

50:15.235 --> 50:16.403
To parents.

51:03.083 --> 51:05.052
Lee!

52:43.349 --> 52:44.885
Hello?

53:02.902 --> 53:04.571
Mr...?

53:04.605 --> 53:07.440
Mr. Bates.

53:07.474 --> 53:09.911
Hello again, boys.

53:12.512 --> 53:14.916
Are you in charge here,
Mr. Bates?

53:16.884 --> 53:20.054
Yes. Yes.

53:20.086 --> 53:22.523
We'd like to come inside
and have a look around,

53:22.556 --> 53:24.291
if we may.

53:26.059 --> 53:27.961
Well... why?

53:29.463 --> 53:30.898
Why not?

53:35.369 --> 53:37.104
You can't come in.

53:39.273 --> 53:40.374
You want the school.

53:40.407 --> 53:43.878
There are orphaned children
in here.

53:43.911 --> 53:46.079
They have nowhere else to go.

53:47.047 --> 53:48.615
Is my daughter in there?

53:51.918 --> 53:53.186
No.

53:54.954 --> 53:56.857
Then you won't mind us
coming in.

54:01.061 --> 54:04.030
Um...
Well, I'm sorry...

54:04.063 --> 54:07.033
- Don't apologize to her.
- Shh, Mac.

54:07.067 --> 54:10.137
I don't think we...
We can't risk that.

54:12.940 --> 54:16.476
I don't want the school
and I don't want anyone hurt.

54:16.510 --> 54:19.546
Mine or yours.

54:19.579 --> 54:23.284
So, you have 24 hours.

54:23.317 --> 54:26.286
Let us in or bring her to us.

54:26.320 --> 54:31.325
After that, we will be
coming in regardless.

54:32.458 --> 54:36.029
Stan? Surround the school.

54:36.063 --> 54:39.432
Nobody in or out.

54:39.465 --> 54:41.301
Understood?

55:12.199 --> 55:14.702
All right!
It's time to grow up.

55:14.735 --> 55:16.670
We need to start
taking shifts 24/7,

55:16.702 --> 55:18.405
patrolling the perimeter
of the school

55:18.438 --> 55:20.574
and keeping watch
from the tower with the rifle.

55:20.606 --> 55:22.976
Now, you kids, you're gonna
have to be very strong

55:23.010 --> 55:25.212
and very brave for us
from now on, OK?

55:25.244 --> 55:26.279
We might have to ration
a little more.

55:26.313 --> 55:28.282
- Do we know what rationing is?
- Mac, listen to me.

55:28.315 --> 55:32.353
Listen to you fucking what?
What?

55:32.385 --> 55:34.153
Mac, don't talk
to Mr. Bates like that.

55:34.186 --> 55:35.455
You're not a teacher.

55:35.489 --> 55:38.992
And you're just a little boy.

55:41.494 --> 55:44.630
I fucking told you so.

55:44.664 --> 55:46.567
We should have got rid of her
when we had the chance.

55:46.599 --> 55:49.536
OK, OK. All right.

55:50.302 --> 55:51.605
I think...

55:53.507 --> 55:55.275
Look, you lot can
go back to bed.

55:55.307 --> 55:56.576
There is nothing to worry about.

55:56.610 --> 56:00.280
There is a great deal
to be worried about.

56:00.313 --> 56:01.782
There are people
outside those walls

56:01.815 --> 56:05.019
who want to take everything
we have, who want to hurt us.

56:05.052 --> 56:08.155
- That's not what they want.
- Oh, you don't think so?

56:09.623 --> 56:11.325
Lee?

56:14.795 --> 56:16.230
Uh...

56:19.766 --> 56:22.302
I mean, yeah.

56:22.335 --> 56:25.472
Yeah. Th-They do seem
to kill a lot of people.

56:27.673 --> 56:30.344
So... I mean, what shall we do?

56:30.376 --> 56:33.380
Right, so you're in charge now,
are you, Mac, you and Lee?

56:33.413 --> 56:35.382
Me?

56:35.414 --> 56:37.018
What do you guys think?

56:44.190 --> 56:46.192
Mac and Lee.

56:46.226 --> 56:47.494
Sorry, sir.

56:47.527 --> 56:48.729
Oh.

56:48.762 --> 56:50.431
Oh, brilliant. Fantastic.

56:50.463 --> 56:51.764
That's just great.

56:51.797 --> 56:55.368
Come on then,
Mr. Billy Big Bollocks!

56:55.402 --> 56:58.572
What are we gonna do?!

56:58.605 --> 57:00.273
What we've always done.

57:03.210 --> 57:05.378
Trust in St. Mark's.

57:07.280 --> 57:11.485
First things first.
These are not toys.

57:11.518 --> 57:13.554
They are insanely dangerous.

57:13.586 --> 57:15.655
Thank Christ there aren't
more of them in this country

57:15.688 --> 57:17.523
or we'd be completely screwed.

57:17.556 --> 57:18.692
Shotgun.

57:18.724 --> 57:20.193
Rifle.

57:20.226 --> 57:21.427
Shotgun.

57:21.460 --> 57:22.596
Rifle.

57:22.628 --> 57:25.266
You've all played Call of Duty.
You know how that works.

57:46.820 --> 57:50.490
Rifle shoots long and accurate,
the shotgun has a spread.

57:50.523 --> 57:51.891
That's important.

57:51.925 --> 57:53.693
If you're using this
around your fellow students,

57:53.726 --> 57:57.297
make sure they are
nowhere near the firing line.

57:57.731 --> 57:58.832
Rowles.

58:25.224 --> 58:26.360
Bang!

59:53.380 --> 59:55.849
I thought you were different.

01:00:06.293 --> 01:00:08.595
At least he has a plan.

01:00:10.329 --> 01:00:13.433
Yes, a... great plan.

01:00:45.364 --> 01:00:46.666
What's this?

01:00:48.568 --> 01:00:51.672
We can't take Mini Baker
out of here now.

01:00:51.704 --> 01:00:53.373
Not with them watching, right?

01:00:56.108 --> 01:00:58.344
Not in one piece.

01:00:59.079 --> 01:01:00.514
But...

01:01:04.516 --> 01:01:06.486
bit by bit.

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:08.755
In the lake.

01:01:08.788 --> 01:01:11.692
In the grounds.
In the flowerbed.

01:01:11.724 --> 01:01:15.061
You know, like that
Christmas movie in the prison.

01:01:15.094 --> 01:01:18.831
Then we rinse the place down
and invite Big Baker in.

01:01:18.864 --> 01:01:21.768
Poke around all she likes,
she's not gonna find a trace.

01:01:25.137 --> 01:01:26.873
What do you think?

01:01:30.376 --> 01:01:31.577
What do I think?

01:01:32.746 --> 01:01:33.880
Mac.

01:01:33.913 --> 01:01:35.548
Uh...

01:02:01.608 --> 01:02:03.376
You wanna win this or not, Lee?

01:02:05.144 --> 01:02:07.514
Cos your mum's not coming
to save us.

01:02:28.067 --> 01:02:29.802
Ooh.

01:02:29.835 --> 01:02:31.671
You nearly got me to be fair.

01:02:46.652 --> 01:02:49.455
- OK, OK.
- Where are you going?

01:02:49.489 --> 01:02:50.691
Patrol.

01:03:04.871 --> 01:03:06.139
Hiya.

01:03:26.159 --> 01:03:29.463
Well, I mean,
I think I cut someone.

01:03:29.496 --> 01:03:31.030
You think you've done it?

01:03:33.199 --> 01:03:34.701
How can you not know?

01:03:40.739 --> 01:03:42.107
Come on. Eh, eh. Ooh.

01:03:42.141 --> 01:03:44.110
Hey, where and when, Wylie, huh?
Where and when, huh?

01:03:44.143 --> 01:03:45.478
- Fuck!
- Where and when?

01:03:45.512 --> 01:03:48.248
- Fuck off!
- Wylie, Wylie!

01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:49.916
- Fuck off!
- Chill out.

01:03:49.949 --> 01:03:51.952
- Dickhead.
- Chill out.

01:03:53.253 --> 01:03:55.822
You don't have to be ashamed.

01:03:55.855 --> 01:03:57.990
You could do it right now
if you want to.

01:04:16.775 --> 01:04:18.611
Hey.

01:04:19.112 --> 01:04:20.646
Come with me.

01:04:46.873 --> 01:04:48.708
Ms. Baker?

01:05:02.922 --> 01:05:06.693
Miss, can you come?
Someone's hurt.

01:05:16.168 --> 01:05:17.971
Shh!

01:05:47.699 --> 01:05:49.902
That's my mum.

01:05:49.936 --> 01:05:53.873
She was serving in Iraq
when the virus hit.

01:05:53.905 --> 01:05:58.144
I want nothing more in the whole
world than to see her again.

01:05:59.211 --> 01:06:02.148
So I understand. I do.

01:06:04.117 --> 01:06:05.752
I have a very vested interest

01:06:05.784 --> 01:06:08.955
in figuring some sort
of way out of this.

01:06:10.289 --> 01:06:12.893
So can we find
a way out of this?

01:06:14.059 --> 01:06:16.195
It's Lee, isn't it?

01:06:17.163 --> 01:06:19.865
Did she call you that?

01:06:19.898 --> 01:06:22.034
- I guess.
- Hmm. Well...

01:06:23.068 --> 01:06:24.871
OK, Lee.

01:06:24.903 --> 01:06:28.108
If you can prove to me that
my daughter isn't in there,

01:06:28.141 --> 01:06:30.644
maybe we can.

01:06:30.677 --> 01:06:32.245
Your move.

01:06:46.025 --> 01:06:47.894
I can't prove that.

01:06:50.028 --> 01:06:51.664
Because she is in there.

01:06:55.702 --> 01:06:58.004
Go on.

01:06:58.036 --> 01:07:02.107
There's something you have
to understand. She started it.

01:07:02.141 --> 01:07:04.411
Nobody here
is responsible for this.

01:07:04.443 --> 01:07:06.779
She was just doing her job.

01:07:06.813 --> 01:07:07.681
Her job's shooting at children?

01:07:07.713 --> 01:07:10.750
Look, I have no doubt
she buggered it up.

01:07:10.782 --> 01:07:13.420
But that doesn't change
anything for me, Lee.

01:07:16.289 --> 01:07:19.726
In the days after the virus hit,
I saw panic.

01:07:19.759 --> 01:07:23.963
And then I saw panic
change very quickly to savagery,

01:07:23.996 --> 01:07:27.334
in people that I'd lived with
and worked with.

01:07:29.101 --> 01:07:31.403
But it must have always
been there, right?

01:07:31.436 --> 01:07:33.139
Beneath the surface.

01:07:33.172 --> 01:07:37.744
So someone somewhere dropped
the wrong petri dish. Fine.

01:07:37.777 --> 01:07:41.313
But in a world
of mobile pornography,

01:07:41.347 --> 01:07:45.151
open borders
and franchise bakeries,

01:07:45.184 --> 01:07:49.222
you were heading for a collapse
one way or another.

01:07:49.255 --> 01:07:52.759
I can remember a time
when things were better,

01:07:52.791 --> 01:07:56.163
but it wasn't right before
the virus.

01:07:58.396 --> 01:08:02.268
<i>Have you asked yourself
how this place looks?</i>

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:05.237
<i>To us? To outsiders?</i>

01:08:06.438 --> 01:08:09.141
<i>This used to be a fine school.</i>

01:08:11.376 --> 01:08:15.481
<i>But now, like everything else,
it's... broken.</i>

01:08:15.514 --> 01:08:17.250
<i>Corrupted.</i>

01:08:20.484 --> 01:08:23.890
<i>I have no faith anymore, Lee.</i>

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:26.493
<i>No faith in people.</i>

01:08:26.524 --> 01:08:29.095
<i>No faith in the future.</i>

01:08:29.127 --> 01:08:32.296
<i>All you can do
is look after your own.</i>

01:08:32.331 --> 01:08:35.335
<i>Because even if we rebuild,</i>

01:08:35.368 --> 01:08:36.770
it's still going to be there,

01:08:36.801 --> 01:08:39.404
this awful thing
that I see here now,

01:08:39.438 --> 01:08:42.475
in a boy called Lee
with a gun at his feet.

01:08:50.048 --> 01:08:51.917
Now's your chance.

01:08:53.452 --> 01:08:55.154
Both of you.

01:09:03.095 --> 01:09:05.131
You can't be a virgin anymore.

01:09:10.368 --> 01:09:11.537
Wylie, you want to get involved?

01:09:11.569 --> 01:09:13.506
What the hell are you doing?

01:09:20.078 --> 01:09:22.081
I wouldn't want
to trouble you with it, sir.

01:09:24.617 --> 01:09:27.354
How bloody dare you?

01:09:35.094 --> 01:09:37.264
Who the hell are you?

01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:41.501
You're not one of <i>our</i> boys.

01:09:44.935 --> 01:09:47.506
More than you are.

01:09:47.538 --> 01:09:50.176
You stop this right now,
Sean MacKillick!

01:09:51.944 --> 01:09:54.881
Let me offer you this.

01:09:54.913 --> 01:09:57.250
Give me my daughter now,

01:09:57.283 --> 01:10:00.220
and maybe we don't
come in and take her.

01:10:04.457 --> 01:10:06.192
OK.

01:10:06.225 --> 01:10:08.395
That's good, that's really good.

01:10:10.029 --> 01:10:12.532
One last thing
before we do that.

01:10:12.564 --> 01:10:15.201
I want to warn you
of some changes to Claire

01:10:15.234 --> 01:10:19.439
that you may find
slightly upsetting.

01:10:20.338 --> 01:10:21.407
During the incident...

01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:24.176
If you've hurt one hair
on her head,

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:27.314
I swear by the God
who left us a long time ago...

01:10:29.614 --> 01:10:32.318
I'll wear your skin as a onesie.

01:10:42.461 --> 01:10:46.164
Hold... and up.

01:10:48.434 --> 01:10:51.337
This is madness, boys!

01:10:51.369 --> 01:10:53.405
It's a rite of passage,
actually, sir.

01:10:53.439 --> 01:10:55.608
Believe it or not,
I've been there myself.

01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:56.909
Back in the day.

01:11:00.445 --> 01:11:02.515
What the hell are you doing?

01:11:06.452 --> 01:11:10.023
Now, be a man
and do the right thing.

01:11:16.429 --> 01:11:18.131
You're insane.

01:11:21.367 --> 01:11:23.637
This must be exhausting for you.

01:11:25.438 --> 01:11:27.073
All of you.

01:11:28.274 --> 01:11:30.610
Being so right all the time.

01:11:32.243 --> 01:11:34.480
How can everyone be so right?

01:11:35.613 --> 01:11:40.152
I agree, nothing's changed.

01:11:40.185 --> 01:11:42.087
The whole world dies

01:11:42.121 --> 01:11:45.992
and somehow now there are more
people telling me what to do.

01:11:47.659 --> 01:11:49.528
Fuck you.

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.632
Fuck you!

01:11:53.666 --> 01:11:54.867
I can promise you this.

01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:58.704
If you don't pack up
and fuck off, she <i>is</i> gonna die!

01:11:59.704 --> 01:12:01.975
And it won't be my doing.

01:12:04.243 --> 01:12:09.048
He's almost finished.
It's a baker's dozen.

01:12:11.050 --> 01:12:13.219
- Go on, boys.
- Don't you dare.

01:12:14.619 --> 01:12:16.155
Last one.

01:12:23.061 --> 01:12:24.730
Stop!

01:12:28.234 --> 01:12:29.469
Hold.

01:12:34.806 --> 01:12:37.109
Let him go.

01:12:37.143 --> 01:12:38.644
Hold.

01:12:38.676 --> 01:12:40.112
You stop now.

01:12:40.145 --> 01:12:43.215
- Hold! Hold!
- Stop now!

01:12:43.649 --> 01:12:45.118
Stop!

01:12:45.583 --> 01:12:47.319
Let it go.

01:12:53.359 --> 01:12:56.162
Get off him! Now! Get off!

01:13:03.836 --> 01:13:05.771
He's not breathing!

01:13:13.779 --> 01:13:16.383
- I have to help him.
- Nobody move.

01:13:17.817 --> 01:13:20.119
- Please.
- Stay where you are!

01:13:32.765 --> 01:13:35.502
In fact, no, get in there.

01:13:36.368 --> 01:13:38.038
Get in there, now!

01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:53.353
All of you!

01:14:16.242 --> 01:14:19.145
You three, on your knees.

01:14:19.177 --> 01:14:21.847
On your knees and stay there!

01:14:23.381 --> 01:14:26.251
You, untie her.

01:14:28.621 --> 01:14:30.789
She isn't tied.

01:14:30.823 --> 01:14:33.259
Don't try to mess with me, son.

01:14:33.826 --> 01:14:36.096
She can't move.

01:14:37.896 --> 01:14:39.631
She can't move at all.

01:14:41.432 --> 01:14:42.301
Get on your knees.

01:14:42.333 --> 01:14:45.304
- Hey, look...
- Get on your knees!

01:14:56.247 --> 01:14:58.384
Oh, sweet girl.

01:15:15.568 --> 01:15:17.770
Oh, Christ!

01:15:40.759 --> 01:15:42.962
Come on! Come on, move it!

01:15:42.994 --> 01:15:45.530
Go, go, go!
Come on, hurry up!

01:15:45.564 --> 01:15:48.434
Move on! Come on! Go, go, go!

01:15:58.711 --> 01:16:00.346
Please! Stop him!

01:16:00.378 --> 01:16:02.181
Hold it!

01:16:32.845 --> 01:16:35.780
- Come on!
- Put the gun down!

01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:45.224
Wait, wait, wait!

01:16:50.762 --> 01:16:52.530
That's what you get
when you fuck...

01:17:33.905 --> 01:17:36.042
OK. OK.
Everyone to the concourse.

01:17:36.074 --> 01:17:38.711
All non-combatants
to the concourse.

01:17:39.778 --> 01:17:41.646
Did something happen?

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:43.481
Great patrol.

01:17:43.515 --> 01:17:44.917
You need to each get
to your choke points.

01:17:44.949 --> 01:17:47.452
Keep them away
from the concourse.

01:17:47.485 --> 01:17:49.087
We need someone
to fill in for Bates.

01:17:49.121 --> 01:17:51.757
- Where is Bates?
- Mac killed him.

01:17:58.529 --> 01:18:00.398
Come on, Mac!
Don't let him do that to you.

01:18:00.431 --> 01:18:02.001
- Stop.
- Come on, Mac.

01:18:02.033 --> 01:18:05.337
Stop! This isn't helping. Stop!

01:18:05.371 --> 01:18:08.341
You're out of order.

01:18:08.373 --> 01:18:10.676
Everything I've done,
I've done for us.

01:18:11.643 --> 01:18:13.011
For St. Mark's.

01:18:19.484 --> 01:18:20.952
Matron, you're going
to be Bates.

01:18:20.985 --> 01:18:22.787
- Oh, thank you.
- Get the kids to the concourse

01:18:22.820 --> 01:18:24.457
- and look after Hammond.
- So be the nurse, then?

01:18:24.489 --> 01:18:27.092
Everyone else,
stick to the plan.

01:18:27.126 --> 01:18:30.563
Let's go, team, huh?
Let's go, come on!

01:18:30.595 --> 01:18:32.364
St. Mark's! Come on!

01:18:39.704 --> 01:18:41.407
Stay alive, Lee.

01:18:42.774 --> 01:18:44.777
It's what your mum
would want now.

01:18:47.712 --> 01:18:49.849
What are you doing?

01:18:49.881 --> 01:18:51.983
I just thought...

01:18:52.016 --> 01:18:53.685
No.

01:20:49.033 --> 01:20:50.068
Go on!

01:21:02.547 --> 01:21:04.617
Come on, come on.

01:21:26.104 --> 01:21:28.039
Jesus Christ.

01:22:17.922 --> 01:22:19.324
Hey!

01:22:46.685 --> 01:22:49.956
Mac!

01:23:09.073 --> 01:23:10.809
Here.

01:23:39.904 --> 01:23:41.640
Gimme that!

01:24:00.891 --> 01:24:01.993
It worked.

01:24:05.096 --> 01:24:06.297
Come on!

01:24:11.302 --> 01:24:12.704
Come on!

01:24:29.087 --> 01:24:32.491
Wait. P-Please don't, please.

01:24:32.524 --> 01:24:35.861
I don't wanna be here.
I don't wanna do this.

01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:41.032
No, no!

01:24:45.369 --> 01:24:47.405
Lee, you need to get on it...

01:25:21.139 --> 01:25:23.007
What's your name, son?

01:25:24.810 --> 01:25:28.013
- Rowles.
- Rowles.

01:25:30.015 --> 01:25:32.318
You look like
a good boy, Rowles.

01:25:34.152 --> 01:25:38.056
Just put the gun down.

01:25:39.356 --> 01:25:42.161
Then you can go, OK?

01:25:43.028 --> 01:25:45.197
You can just go.

01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:47.098
Right out that door.

01:25:49.234 --> 01:25:51.337
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:54.907
That's not what I'm here for.

01:25:56.106 --> 01:25:57.408
That's OK.

01:25:58.409 --> 01:25:59.878
On the floor.

01:26:08.052 --> 01:26:09.320
Now...

01:26:11.989 --> 01:26:14.893
where are they keeping
my daughter?

01:26:14.926 --> 01:26:16.562
The concourse.

01:26:17.863 --> 01:26:19.164
Show me.

01:26:23.935 --> 01:26:25.571
Mummy's here.

01:26:27.538 --> 01:26:29.073
Hey.

01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:32.511
Hey.

01:26:43.255 --> 01:26:46.257
Sorry. Sorry.

01:26:48.627 --> 01:26:50.396
Oh!

01:27:34.972 --> 01:27:36.207
Wolf!

01:27:40.278 --> 01:27:41.547
Wylie!

01:27:45.350 --> 01:27:46.619
Oh!

01:27:59.064 --> 01:28:00.798
Wylie, go!

01:28:04.668 --> 01:28:06.505
Come here!

01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:09.975
Wylie! Wylie!

01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:19.251
Wylie...

01:29:23.715 --> 01:29:25.985
Stay with us, Mr. Hammond.

01:30:25.877 --> 01:30:27.346
Fuck.

01:30:30.247 --> 01:30:31.481
Fuck.

01:30:35.353 --> 01:30:36.622
Fuck.

01:30:57.307 --> 01:30:58.609
Fuck.

01:31:06.518 --> 01:31:07.819
Fuck.

01:31:10.287 --> 01:31:11.589
Fuck.

01:32:32.270 --> 01:32:33.572
Take it.

01:32:36.841 --> 01:32:38.310
Use it.

01:33:33.363 --> 01:33:34.865
Claire?

01:35:07.425 --> 01:35:08.960
She's dead.

01:35:32.516 --> 01:35:33.784
No.

01:35:43.427 --> 01:35:45.096
It's not for St. Mark's.

01:35:47.465 --> 01:35:49.067
It's for you.

01:37:51.822 --> 01:37:53.925
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.996
Boys and girls.

01:38:03.833 --> 01:38:06.770
What an awful summer we've had.

01:38:10.942 --> 01:38:12.877
"He was tall but round..."

01:38:12.909 --> 01:38:17.748
<i>We've achieved
so much since then.</i>

01:38:23.054 --> 01:38:25.923
<i>We've improved our diversity.</i>

01:38:28.359 --> 01:38:30.962
<i>And our security.</i>

01:38:34.198 --> 01:38:37.802
<i>Entered a new era of diplomacy.</i>

01:38:48.345 --> 01:38:52.283
<i>And even begun caring
for the frail and elderly.</i>

01:38:59.789 --> 01:39:02.726
<i>And we couldn't have done</i>

01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:05.997
any of those things

01:39:06.029 --> 01:39:12.202
if it hadn't been for one
of our most brilliant students.

01:39:14.270 --> 01:39:15.773
Lee Keegan.

01:39:19.143 --> 01:39:24.849
To whom today we must
also bid a fond farewell.

01:39:29.185 --> 01:39:32.156
<i>Lee is going to the coast.</i>

01:39:35.725 --> 01:39:39.330
<i>And may be going
further even than that.</i>

01:39:46.837 --> 01:39:48.940
He's looking for his mother.

01:39:51.975 --> 01:39:55.078
Because he loves her very much.

01:39:55.112 --> 01:39:58.783
You could tell him that it's
the stupidest idea in the world.

01:39:58.815 --> 01:40:01.853
But Lee doesn't like
being told what to do.

01:40:07.123 --> 01:40:08.859
<i>We hope...</i>

01:40:08.893 --> 01:40:13.832
<i>we insist, in fact, that
he comes back in one piece.</i>

01:40:16.867 --> 01:40:19.371
He'll always be welcome here.

01:40:21.372 --> 01:40:24.743
<i>And no matter where
his journey takes him,</i>

01:40:27.211 --> 01:40:32.117
<i>he'll always be
a student of St. Mark's.</i>

01:40:59.295 --> 01:41:04.295
