Because if I'm not, then...

08:34.184 --> 08:36.000
what have I been doing
this whole time?

08:36.000 --> 08:38.000
what have I been doing
this whole time?

08:38.000 --> 08:38.288
what have I been doing
this whole time?

08:38.322 --> 08:40.000
The staff.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.557
The staff.

08:40.591 --> 08:42.000
Putting on a costume.

08:42.000 --> 08:43.740
Putting on a costume.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.000
I got Henry killed.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.533
I got Henry killed.

08:49.567 --> 08:50.000
And Joey.

08:50.000 --> 08:50.735

08:50.768 --> 08:52.000
Courtney, you didn't
kill anyone.

kill anyone.

08:54.000 --> 08:54.172

Hey, what the hell's going on?

09:00.000 --> 09:00.477
Hey, what the hell's going on?

09:00.477 --> 09:01.846
Court, is that guy
really your old man?

09:01.846 --> 09:02.000
Mike, we're talking
privately here, okay?

09:02.000 --> 09:04.000
Mike, we're talking
privately here, okay?

09:04.000 --> 09:04.115
Mike, we're talking
privately here, okay?

09:04.149 --> 09:06.000
And are you and Barbara
breaking up?

09:06.000 --> 09:06.283
And are you and Barbara
breaking up?

09:06.317 --> 09:08.000
-Is that why he's here?

[Mike] Why won't you
tell me anything?

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
[Mike] Why won't you
tell me anything?

09:16.000 --> 09:16.259
[Mike] Why won't you
tell me anything?

09:16.293 --> 09:18.000
What did I do wrong?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.000
What did I do wrong?

09:20.000 --> 09:20.498
What did I do wrong?

09:26.202 --> 09:27.205
Don't worry.

09:27.238 --> 09:28.000
Everything's gonna be
fine, okay?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Everything's gonna be

09:48.258 --> 09:50.000
[Barbara] Good boy.

09:50.000 --> 09:50.061
[Barbara] Good boy.

09:50.094 --> 09:52.000
When you didn't show up
for Christmas Eve,

09:52.000 --> 09:52.495
When you didn't show up
for Christmas Eve,

09:52.529 --> 09:54.000
I called you, I emailed you

09:54.000 --> 09:54.465
I called you, I emailed you

09:54.498 --> 09:55.700
dozens of times.

09:55.732 --> 09:56.000
I never got a reply back.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.534
I never got a reply back.

09:57.567 --> 09:58.000
I looked for you
for over a year

09:58.000 --> 09:59.503
I looked for you
for over a year

09:59.537 --> 10:00.000
for Courtney's sake.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.739
for Courtney's sake.

10:01.773 --> 10:02.000
And I...
I finally just gave up.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
And I...
I finally just gave up.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
And I...
I finally just gave up.

10:06.000 --> 10:06.176
And I...
I finally just gave up.

10:06.210 --> 10:08.000
[Sam sighs] I know.

10:08.000 --> 10:08.546
[Sam sighs] I know.

10:08.578 --> 10:10.000
It's been a decade, Sam.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.950
It's been a decade, Sam.

10:11.982 --> 10:12.000
Why are you really here?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
Why are you really here?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.582
Why are you really here?

10:20.000 --> 10:20.958

10:20.991 --> 10:22.000
Okay, Barbara, the truth is...

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
Okay, Barbara, the truth is...

10:24.000 --> 10:24.299
Okay, Barbara, the truth is...

10:24.299 --> 10:25.259
I've been thinking about

10:25.263 --> 10:26.000
reaching out to you
for months now.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
reaching out to you
for months now.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.000
reaching out to you
for months now.

10:30.000 --> 10:30.263
reaching out to you
for months now.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
I'm here to
get to know my daughter
before it's too late.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
I'm here to
get to know my daughter
before it's too late.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.472
I'm here to
get to know my daughter
before it's too late.

10:35.505 --> 10:36.000
If it's not already too late.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
If it's not already too late.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.855
If it's not already too late.

10:42.647 --> 10:43.748
I wanna talk to him.

10:43.780 --> 10:44.000
You have school.

10:44.000 --> 10:44.948
You have school.

10:44.982 --> 10:46.000
So I go in a little late.

10:46.000 --> 10:46.683
So I go in a little late.

10:46.716 --> 10:48.000
Court, you know
why you have to go.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.885
Court, you know
why you have to go.

10:48.919 --> 10:50.000
You brought him here,

10:50.000 --> 10:50.354
You brought him here,

10:50.386 --> 10:52.000
at least let me talk to him.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.758
at least let me talk to him.

10:53.791 --> 10:54.000
We'll just go for a quick walk.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.692
We'll just go for a quick walk.

10:55.725 --> 10:56.000
That's it.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
That's it.

10:58.000 --> 10:58.629
That's it.

10:58.629 --> 10:59.629
Fine.

11:50.815 --> 11:52.000
I will find my steed.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.965
I will find my steed.

12:04.293 --> 12:06.000
He can help me.

12:06.000 --> 12:06.543
He can help me.

12:12.469 --> 12:13.469
Whoa.

12:20.878 --> 12:22.000
[Sam] What do you think
of Blue Valley?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.014
[Sam] What do you think
of Blue Valley?

12:23.047 --> 12:24.000
Big change from L.A., huh?

12:24.000 --> 12:24.648
Big change from L.A., huh?

12:24.648 --> 12:26.000
Where have you been?

12:26.000 --> 12:28.000
Where have you been?

12:28.000 --> 12:28.921
Where have you been?

12:28.953 --> 12:30.000
I don't have a good excuse,
if that's what you're looking for.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.522
I don't have a good excuse,
if that's what you're looking for.

12:31.554 --> 12:32.000
I'm not looking for an excuse.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.789
I'm not looking for an excuse.

12:32.822 --> 12:34.000
I just wanna know the truth.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
I just wanna know the truth.

12:36.000 --> 12:36.793
I just wanna know the truth.

12:36.826 --> 12:38.000
That's fair.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.096
That's fair.

12:39.129 --> 12:40.000
And if you didn't resent me,

12:40.000 --> 12:41.298
And if you didn't resent me,

12:41.331 --> 12:42.000
I'd think there was
something wrong with you.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.868
I'd think there was
something wrong with you.

12:43.900 --> 12:44.000
You know, I wasn't
always with you,

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
You know, I wasn't
always with you,

12:46.000 --> 12:46.336
You know, I wasn't
always with you,

12:46.370 --> 12:48.000
but I always kept
a picture of you with me.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.340
but I always kept
a picture of you with me.

12:49.374 --> 12:50.000
There wasn't a day
that went by
I didn't look at that picture.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.000
There wasn't a day
that went by
I didn't look at that picture.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.110
There wasn't a day
that went by
I didn't look at that picture.

12:53.144 --> 12:54.000
My mother gave me these lockets

12:54.000 --> 12:54.979
My mother gave me these lockets

12:55.011 --> 12:56.000
and I gave one to you
when you were four.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
and I gave one to you
when you were four.

12:58.000 --> 12:58.081
and I gave one to you
when you were four.

12:58.115 --> 13:00.000
Christmas. That was
the last time I saw you.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.119
Christmas. That was
the last time I saw you.

13:01.152 --> 13:02.000
We sang
Christmas carols together.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
We sang
Christmas carols together.

13:04.000 --> 13:04.221
We sang
Christmas carols together.

13:04.254 --> 13:06.000
"Frosty" was your favorite.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.292
"Frosty" was your favorite.

13:07.325 --> 13:08.000
We made a snowman
out of Styrofoam.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
We made a snowman
out of Styrofoam.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
We made a snowman
out of Styrofoam.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.325

13:16.000 --> 13:16.033
I...

13:16.067 --> 13:18.000
remember that.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.167
remember that.

13:21.139 --> 13:22.000
[Sam] Well,
that's a bad picture.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
[Sam] Well,
that's a bad picture.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
[Sam] Well,

13:26.000 --> 13:26.110
[Sam] Well,

13:26.144 --> 13:28.000
Courtney, I have no right
to have come here...

13:28.000 --> 13:29.880
Courtney, I have no right
to have come here...

13:29.913 --> 13:30.000
to ask you to hear me out.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.000
to ask you to hear me out.

13:32.000 --> 13:32.015
to ask you to hear me out.

13:32.049 --> 13:33.518
To say "I'm sorry"

13:33.552 --> 13:34.000
about the things that I've done
or haven't done.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.919
about the things that I've done
or haven't done.

13:35.952 --> 13:36.000
It's never gonna be enough.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
It's never gonna be enough.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.224
It's never gonna be enough.

13:39.256 --> 13:40.000
I just want you to know that...

13:40.000 --> 13:41.859
I just want you to know that...

13:41.859 --> 13:42.000
I'd give anything
if I could go back in time

13:42.000 --> 13:43.293
I'd give anything
if I could go back in time

13:43.293 --> 13:44.000
and do things differently.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.000

I just needed to say that.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
I just needed to say that.

Just 30 minutes,

14:08.000 --> 14:08.652
Just 30 minutes,

14:08.686 --> 14:09.820
so I can explain.

14:09.854 --> 14:10.000
That's it.

still needed slaying.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.000
But the dragon
still needed slaying.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.131
But the dragon

25:22.526 --> 25:23.661
-She texted you?
-Yeah.

25:23.693 --> 25:24.000
Why didn't she text me?

25:24.000 --> 25:25.194
Why didn't she text me?

25:25.229 --> 25:26.000
Did she say anything else?

25:26.000 --> 25:26.463
Did she say anything else?

25:26.497 --> 25:28.000
Just that she's safe.

25:38.409 --> 25:40.000
people down in the tunnels

25:40.000 --> 25:40.044
people down in the tunnels

25:40.077 --> 25:42.000

like zombies.

25:42.000 --> 25:42.046
that looked and moved
like zombies.

25:42.079 --> 25:44.000
I think I know what
they could be planning,

25:44.000 --> 25:44.915
I think I know what

jeweler to the stars.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.431
And old-time
jeweler to the stars.

27:07.464 --> 27:08.000
Like Marilyn Monroe-type
people.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.000
Like Marilyn Monroe-type
people.

27:10.000 --> 27:10.067
Like Marilyn Monroe-type
people.

27:10.101 --> 27:12.000
Actually, they're
really valuable.

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Actually, they're
really valuable.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.101
Actually, they're
really valuable.

27:15.271 --> 27:16.000
And I was thinking

27:16.000 --> 27:16.941
And I was thinking

27:16.974 --> 27:18.000
that if I sold them,

27:18.000 --> 27:18.541
that if I sold them,

27:18.576 --> 27:20.000
then I could put a deposit down

27:20.000 --> 27:20.845
then I could put a deposit down

27:20.877 --> 27:22.000
on my own place.

27:22.000 --> 27:22.846
on my own place.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.000
And once I get that settled,

27:24.000 --> 27:25.016
And once I get that settled,

27:25.048 --> 27:26.000
that'll be where
you come visit.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.000
that'll be where
you come visit.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.286
that'll be where
you come visit.

27:29.286 --> 27:30.000
Yeah, and I could...

27:30.000 --> 27:30.286
Yeah, and I could...

27:30.288 --> 27:32.000
I could buy you
a bracelet or some,

27:32.000 --> 27:32.355
I could buy you
a bracelet or some,

27:32.388 --> 27:33.857
some really pretty earrings.

27:33.891 --> 27:34.000
We can go shopping
together in L.A.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.000
We can go shopping
together in L.A.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.794
We can go shopping
together in L.A.

27:36.827 --> 27:38.000
We'll go to The Grove.

27:38.000 --> 27:40.000
We'll go to The Grove.

27:40.000 --> 27:40.698
We'll go to The Grove.

27:40.730 --> 27:42.000
And then when I'm settled in,

27:42.000 --> 27:42.967
And then when I'm settled in,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.000
then you'd come visit.

27:44.000 --> 27:44.769
then you'd come visit.

27:44.769 --> 27:46.000
Yeah, my place now,
it's like a shoe-box.

27:46.000 --> 27:46.403
Yeah, my place now,
it's like a shoe-box.

27:46.403 --> 27:48.000
It's barely big enough
for me by myself.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
It's barely big enough
for me by myself.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.403
It's barely big enough
for me by myself.

27:52.542 --> 27:53.542
Um...

28:01.551 --> 28:02.000
Yeah.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.287

Not as good as when I had her.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.884
Not as good as when I had her.

31:46.510 --> 31:48.000
I put all of us
in so much danger,

31:48.000 --> 31:49.880
I put all of us
in so much danger,

31:49.913 --> 31:50.000
because I believed
in some fairy tale.

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000

32:20.211 --> 32:22.000
You might die. [sniffles]

32:22.000 --> 32:23.961
You might die. [sniffles]

32:55.445 --> 32:56.000
I don't think it matters, Mom.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.000
I don't think it matters, Mom.

32:58.000 --> 32:59.945
