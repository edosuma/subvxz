WEBVTT

02:04.499 --> 02:05.875
Let's see.

02:06.584 --> 02:07.836
All right, Taira.

02:08.962 --> 02:09.879
Tsukasa.

02:10.755 --> 02:11.714
Tsukasa!

02:12.340 --> 02:13.842
Are you there, Taira?

02:15.176 --> 02:20.056
No need to stand.
Please read passage three on page 136.

02:20.682 --> 02:22.308
I'm sorry!

02:23.226 --> 02:25.145
"In the Middle Ages, cities were..."

02:25.395 --> 02:28.148
It's been a month
since Akimura disappeared.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.901
They say he's studying abroad.

02:34.696 --> 02:38.074
His arrest wasn't in the news.
Is it because he is a vampire?

02:39.242 --> 02:42.745
Since then, I haven't seen Mr. Anzai.

02:44.372 --> 02:48.209
Was it all just my imagination?

03:03.558 --> 03:05.643
Wait! There's a syringe sticking out!

03:06.060 --> 03:08.438
I know! I did it to myself!

03:09.022 --> 03:11.190
I used a sedative on myself.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.569
Are my eyes normal now?

03:18.114 --> 03:19.115
Yes.

03:19.365 --> 03:22.452
It's strange how his face looks better.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.412
Is it because the dark circles
disappeared?

03:24.537 --> 03:25.371
Well...

03:26.706 --> 03:29.292
I'm sorry. I put my tongue in.

03:31.836 --> 03:35.757
-Don't tell me about your tongue!
-I'm sorry! Don't hit me! Hey!

03:36.716 --> 03:37.550
So,

03:39.177 --> 03:41.638
does that mean you're also a vampire?

03:46.768 --> 03:48.102
I'm sorry, that's...

03:48.519 --> 03:50.021
No, it's fine.

03:50.605 --> 03:53.483
Well, I have both blood strains,
so I guess I'm half.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.610
Half?

03:56.152 --> 04:00.323
That's why I wanted to remove
those desires. But I was wrong.

04:05.662 --> 04:08.373
In the end, Akimura's self-control
was useless.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.709
Anyway, cheer up.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.797
There's plenty of guys out there.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.259
Wait!

04:27.517 --> 04:30.770
Since then, I haven't seen Mr. Anzai.

04:38.319 --> 04:41.531
Am I just thinking of him
because he kissed me?

04:43.366 --> 04:44.200
But...

04:47.704 --> 04:51.291
that's not love at all.

04:54.585 --> 04:55.545
Akimura.

05:01.467 --> 05:04.178
Take care, Akimura.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.892
First of all,

05:10.560 --> 05:13.896
I'm not sure I've ever seriously
liked anyone.

05:14.731 --> 05:18.484
Honestly, that was my first kiss.

05:19.861 --> 05:22.739
I wonder where Mr. Anzai is at this hour.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.827
Hey! Don't be so scared!

05:29.412 --> 05:30.538
Mr. Anzai.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.333
Why the veranda?

05:33.833 --> 05:36.961
It's the reception.
There's better range here.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.296
Reception?

05:39.464 --> 05:40.381
Are you okay?

05:42.717 --> 05:44.635
Are you worried about Akimura?

05:46.054 --> 05:49.223
You always visit the place
where he was captured.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.105
If you want, I could apply for a visit.

05:56.731 --> 06:00.318
There are cases when criminals sentenced
to life are allowed to have visitors.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.490
I'm such a bad person,

06:05.907 --> 06:09.660
I completely forgot about Akimura.
I've only been thinking about Mr. Anzai.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.621
I'm the worst.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.582
Have you lost weight?

06:15.291 --> 06:17.668
You would be more popular
if you were a little chubby.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.756
Hey, that hurts!

06:22.173 --> 06:23.966
Stop punching me!

06:25.593 --> 06:26.511
What the hell.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.180
You're doing better than I thought!

06:31.641 --> 06:33.309
He smiled.

06:35.645 --> 06:38.439
This is Sawazaki.
There's been a Level 1 incident.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.942
The suspect is a 21-year-old female
named Yuko Tamaru.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.820
The suspect is labeled as target "T."
Okay?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.405
Allegedly, she is hiding
in the Mikusa Building.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.408
This is Anzai, roger.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.577
She's nearby. I'm going now.

07:08.678 --> 07:09.679
MIKUSA BUILDING

07:13.933 --> 07:14.809
Calm down.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.395
I would like to handle this calmly.

07:17.728 --> 07:18.771
You're Yuko Tamaru, right?

07:22.400 --> 07:23.401
Are you the police?

07:23.776 --> 07:26.195
Public Safety, Division 5.
Our specialty is demons.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.740
As this is your first offense,
there may be room for mercy.

07:30.324 --> 07:31.409
Next time, there won't be any.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.954
If this was really an accident,
your crimes will...

07:35.079 --> 07:38.666
Crimes? I'm not worried about the law!

07:38.958 --> 07:42.044
Then why did you run, Yuko?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.548
Yuki.

07:47.842 --> 07:51.804
Do you have someone
whom you would do anything to protect?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.974
You'll never understand how I feel!

07:55.933 --> 08:01.189
My partner was helping me cook
and accidentally cut his finger.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.733
Then he asked, "Will you lick it?"

08:06.152 --> 08:10.781
Before I knew it, I had stabbed him,
and desperately drained him of his blood.

08:12.992 --> 08:16.621
I was always so careful.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.789
I tried not to hurt him.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.459
But in the end, it was useless.

08:22.460 --> 08:26.214
It's impossible for humans and demons
to get married and be together.

08:26.881 --> 08:27.882
Obviously.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.219
Cutting his finger
and asking you to lick it.

08:31.928 --> 08:33.638
How the hell is that being careful?

08:35.431 --> 08:39.018
Even as someone's partner,
we forget who we are when we see blood.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.814
You never really told him
how dangerous you are, did you?

08:45.233 --> 08:47.151
You keep saying you want to protect him,

08:47.568 --> 08:49.654
but you were just afraid
of him hating you instead.

08:53.074 --> 08:55.034
You should have told him.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.672
On the third of December, at 11:35 p.m.,

09:08.172 --> 09:10.508
target "T" was taken into custody.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.426
Squad F's leader,

09:12.718 --> 09:16.722
Sergeant Sawazaki,
and Officer Anzai took charge.

09:38.035 --> 09:40.788
You followed me, didn't you?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.250
And you didn't lock your door?

09:44.875 --> 09:46.794
Even when it's late
and you're a girl who is all alone!

09:47.211 --> 09:49.338
You're right, I'm sorry!

09:49.630 --> 09:51.507
But you dropped this.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.184
I'm sorry.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.480
He's very different when he's apologizing.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.359
But, if it happens again,
you don't have to bring it to me.

10:12.194 --> 10:13.195
Okay?

10:14.905 --> 10:15.740
Yes.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.368
That person earlier...

10:20.703 --> 10:22.121
A childhood friend.

10:23.122 --> 10:26.375
We used to make snowmen together.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.213
It's cold.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.929
Don't ever get hurt in front of me.

10:43.893 --> 10:47.772
If you're not a relative, it's hard
to set up a visit with one of us,

10:48.064 --> 10:51.525
but since you are linked to the case,
exceptions can be made.

10:52.151 --> 10:54.195
If you want to see him...

10:55.488 --> 10:56.364
Is that okay?

10:56.697 --> 10:59.867
If it's possible, I would like to.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.869
You have a kotatsu.

11:02.286 --> 11:03.204
Do you have one at home?

11:04.121 --> 11:06.540
I only have what I need to survive.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.252
Maybe you need one.
Are you sensitive to the cold?

11:10.628 --> 11:13.297
Not really, but my body temperature is
27 degrees Celsius.

11:13.672 --> 11:14.799
That's so low!

11:15.925 --> 11:18.010
Hey, Anzai. Where are you right now?

11:18.844 --> 11:20.721
You shouldn't act alone.

11:21.555 --> 11:22.973
Sorry, I have to go.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.684
I won't be back,
so close your door properly.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.270
Oh, wait!

11:30.773 --> 11:33.692
What? I could never do it
while being watched.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.487
Welcome!

11:37.238 --> 11:38.072
Anzai!

11:39.448 --> 11:41.283
Oh, right, here are the sedatives.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.494
Thank you, sorry for the hassle.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.122
Sawazaki isn't here yet?

11:47.039 --> 11:50.709
He'll be here soon. He said
he would be preaching until later.

11:51.168 --> 11:54.088
Did you go off on your own again?

11:54.338 --> 11:55.297
Looks like it!

11:55.506 --> 11:58.217
Yuki, you haven't been hanging out
with us lately!

11:58.717 --> 12:02.596
Poor boy, you're always alone,
so I was just having some fun with you.

12:02.680 --> 12:03.681
Leave me be.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.599
I'll have some water.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.768
Wait. Are you two dating?

12:08.477 --> 12:10.062
It's obvious, can't you tell?

12:10.688 --> 12:11.772
Really?

12:12.189 --> 12:13.816
What do you mean it's obvious?

12:13.983 --> 12:15.151
What the heck are you saying?

12:15.734 --> 12:16.819
Don't mind her.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.451
What have you guys been talking about?

12:26.245 --> 12:30.082
Just a bunch of nonsense,
but we're going to talk about work.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.418
Demon's Guidelines of Action, Article One.

12:32.960 --> 12:36.714
From now on, the procreation between
humans and vampires will be legalized

12:37.089 --> 12:40.301
only upon the agreement of the parties,
and it should be witnessed by a doctor.

12:44.388 --> 12:45.890
But I don't know if it's a good idea.

12:46.348 --> 12:48.976
For example, Tamaru became a human's wife.

12:49.268 --> 12:53.397
Then, went as far as agreeing to marry
without sex. What a sorry state.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.870
What kind of hotpot should I make?

13:09.663 --> 13:10.498
Hotpot?

13:10.956 --> 13:12.041
With you?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.585
Well, the veranda's cold.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.838
Also, I have some things to ask you.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.217
No, wait. It's just that,

13:22.009 --> 13:24.512
letting me in your room is certainly...

13:31.435 --> 13:34.897
Maybe it would be fine
after the regular meeting tomorrow.

13:37.733 --> 13:41.862
Okay! I'll go and buy some stuff
at the supermarket on my way home!

13:42.238 --> 13:43.739
-Do you have a favorite--
-Why are you...

13:44.865 --> 13:46.367
so happy?

13:46.867 --> 13:48.536
What? I'm not!

13:49.078 --> 13:51.705
Well, I'll catch up with you
once you're done.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.500
If you're going shopping,
let me carry your bags.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.587
So, which university do you go to again?

14:01.590 --> 14:04.552
Mr. Ochiai's office is...

14:06.053 --> 14:07.638
Oh, the lights are...

14:09.181 --> 14:11.725
Ms. Taira? You surprised me!

14:11.976 --> 14:13.227
Why are you here at this time?

14:14.770 --> 14:17.231
I wanted to return the book I borrowed.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.608
Oh, so you had it?

14:20.192 --> 14:22.945
Sorry, I completely forgot about it.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.155
It's okay!

14:26.156 --> 14:28.492
Wait, is it snowing outside?

14:30.995 --> 14:33.789
You must be really cold.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.708
How about I warm you up a bit?

14:35.958 --> 14:37.710
No, I...

14:38.335 --> 14:39.879
I can make you some tea.

14:46.760 --> 14:51.265
Should demons and humans live separately?

14:52.099 --> 14:53.601
What's this all of a sudden?

14:53.893 --> 14:56.145
It's Anzai's belief, not mine.

14:57.479 --> 15:01.984
Target "T", Yuko Tamaru, and Anzai
apparently grew up together.

15:02.401 --> 15:03.402
What?

15:03.986 --> 15:06.196
In light of recent the recent
serial murders involving vampires,

15:06.447 --> 15:08.073
it seems that there's a lot on his mind.

15:09.992 --> 15:14.121
Since the incident,
he would occasionally go see her.

15:14.538 --> 15:16.415
Here. It's hot, so be careful.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.667
Thank you.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.589
Oh, where did I put it?

15:25.341 --> 15:27.176
Maybe I am thinking too much.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.762
That was kind of scary.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.808
But, I wasn't scared that time.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.062
Even when I was kissed
by a complete stranger.

15:38.562 --> 15:40.397
It's not normal!

15:40.731 --> 15:42.483
There's something wrong with me!

15:42.983 --> 15:44.318
I found it!

15:45.819 --> 15:47.488
There are some really good passages.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.282
I was going to give it to you
the next time we saw each other.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.367
No.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.787
I was pretty late in returning
the other book, so I'm not sure I should--

15:54.870 --> 15:57.247
If it will make your thesis better,
it's fine!

15:57.790 --> 16:01.085
You can return it after six months.
Please take it.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.755
Well, if you insist.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.223
It got dark quickly!

16:14.473 --> 16:16.308
I wonder if I should wait here.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.727
Is that guy waiting for someone?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.521
Quiet! He can hear you.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.690
What the hell am I doing?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.276
Please don't!

16:48.215 --> 16:49.675
What are you doing?

16:50.592 --> 16:53.721
I'm glad you didn't directly
hit me with it,

16:54.388 --> 16:56.015
but I really liked that cup.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.517
I'm sorry.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.144
Just kidding.

17:00.978 --> 17:02.563
Let me see your wound.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.815
It didn't have to be like this.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.484
If you didn't want to,
you should have just said so.

17:07.818 --> 17:12.156
If I don't say no, does it mean
you can do whatever you like?

17:12.406 --> 17:13.323
You don't think so?

17:13.615 --> 17:15.451
If you don't say otherwise, isn't it okay?

17:16.618 --> 17:21.957
But, you're married and you have children.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.333
So what?

17:27.379 --> 17:31.341
But in the end, whether or not
they are lost to monsters,

17:31.592 --> 17:33.469
it will depend on the person himself.

17:34.803 --> 17:35.637
No, please.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.756
Who the hell are...

18:12.341 --> 18:13.300
you?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.731
Wait, stop it already! He'll die!

18:45.124 --> 18:48.001
Mr. Ochiai, what was that noise?
Are you okay?

18:48.210 --> 18:51.880
Just call the cops,
tell them a vampire appeared.

18:53.215 --> 18:55.551
Tell them about the sexual harassment.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.511
Do you have a spare key?

18:59.721 --> 19:01.431
Wait, stay here.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.641
Don't touch me!

19:10.107 --> 19:11.024
What happened?

19:11.108 --> 19:13.861
Mr. Ochiai, are you okay? What happened?

19:13.944 --> 19:15.737
-Quickly!
-We better call an ambulance.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.699
Hey, Mr. Ochiai!

19:21.869 --> 19:25.372
I'll definitely be punished for this.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.544
Her blood.

19:31.086 --> 19:33.046
I need to wash it away quickly.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.647
It's been two weeks.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.651
Mr. Ochiai was fired as punishment.

19:56.236 --> 19:57.779
The wound on my hand healed.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.448
I'll see you later!

19:59.740 --> 20:01.366
But, since then,

20:02.409 --> 20:04.578
Mr. Ochiai appears in my dreams.

20:09.416 --> 20:10.417
It's freezing!

20:16.340 --> 20:18.842
I wonder what he's doing now.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.285
Hey! You were awake?

20:45.744 --> 20:46.995
Mr. Anzai?

20:48.872 --> 20:52.209
I wanted to thank you.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.835
Did you make this?

20:55.170 --> 20:56.004
Yes.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.841
You're really good.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.930
Sorry. Are you afraid of men?

21:05.764 --> 21:08.100
No, unless it's you.

21:08.892 --> 21:11.770
Why aren't you afraid of me?

21:12.145 --> 21:17.150
This jacket is really warm.

21:18.318 --> 21:22.823
When I wear it, I don't have
strange dreams that much.

21:23.991 --> 21:26.952
Are you having bad dreams?

21:43.552 --> 21:46.722
I have to give you something, too.
A present.

23:32.911 --> 23:33.829
Devil's Line.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.831
Line 3.

23:36.873 --> 23:37.707
Paradox.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.001
