01:10.454 --> 01:15.709
No!

01:45.114 --> 01:47.950
They're planning five 
simultaneous attacks.

01:48.158 --> 01:50.828
The US Consulate,
the Galata Synagogue...

01:50.995 --> 01:53.706
both Bosporus bridges
and right here, the subway.

01:54.456 --> 01:56.792
They've also kidnapped
some high-profile businessmen.

01:57.042 --> 01:59.336
Salim, how is this connected to
today's assassination?

01:59.503 --> 02:00.337
I don't know.

02:00.504 --> 02:02.297
I found out by chance.

02:02.506 --> 02:05.592
They've just begun to trust me.
I'm being sent to Batman.

02:05.843 --> 02:10.973
Okay, Salim. Stay in touch with Remzi.
We'll handle things tomorrow. Goodbye.

02:16.895 --> 02:19.023
Terrorists strike again in Istanbul.

02:19.231 --> 02:23.027
Journalist Dursun Þahin has been killed
in a car bombing similar to...

02:23.193 --> 02:27.865
...the murders of Ahmet Kýþlalý,
Uður Mumcu and Bahriye Üçok.

02:28.157 --> 02:30.034
What do you think?
Who is responsible for this?

02:30.284 --> 02:32.828
Unfortunately, we've never been able
to find out who's behind...

02:32.953 --> 02:34.705
these kinds of assassinations.

02:35.080 --> 02:37.082
I couldn't tell you.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.169
Oðuz, are you on top
of the investigation?

02:40.502 --> 02:43.714
Mahmut's meeting with Salim.
I just spoke with Fýrat.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.717
He said none of the congregations would
plan something like this.

02:46.967 --> 02:50.804
I've given orders to all the units.

02:55.142 --> 02:57.019
This is not good.

02:58.479 --> 03:03.484
Did they not rain bombs on little
children during night raids...

03:03.692 --> 03:07.154
...in Iraq? Palestine? Afghanistan?

03:08.364 --> 03:13.118
What have the world or the United Nations
done to stop them?

03:14.078 --> 03:19.458
Their only purpose is to enforce
blockades on poor countries.

03:20.084 --> 03:29.969
They seize other people's
homes and settle in them...

03:30.511 --> 03:35.224
...they think they can control
the world with their guns.

03:36.266 --> 03:41.397
They don't realize that
it is divine mercy and intervention...

03:41.647 --> 03:43.691
...and reverence for our Prophet...

03:45.943 --> 03:48.904
...that makes the world go round.

03:49.113 --> 03:54.451
How many times is a fire,
a storm, a scourge...

03:57.204 --> 04:00.124
O, killers of babies!
Have mercy!

04:00.499 --> 04:01.583
Mercy!

04:01.792 --> 04:04.712
O, spawn of Satan,
have mercy!

04:04.920 --> 04:05.963
Mercy!

04:06.213 --> 04:12.303
O, nest of abominations,
mercy, mercy, mercy!

04:14.972 --> 04:21.312
The things of this world
are temporary. Do no evil, my brothers.

04:24.356 --> 04:27.276
Do not stray from
the path of Allah.

04:28.110 --> 04:34.450
At ease, Police Academy graduates!
Stand at attention!

04:36.827 --> 04:38.162
Friends...

04:39.163 --> 04:40.914
...you have graduated...

04:41.373 --> 04:46.253
...and will begin to serve
and protect across the nation.

04:47.087 --> 04:51.342
You may be called
upon to sacrifice your lives...

04:52.301 --> 04:55.512
...in the line of fire
as you protect and defend...

04:56.263 --> 05:02.728
...the lives, property and honor
of all the citizens of this country...

05:04.271 --> 05:09.943
...regardless of language,
religion and race.

05:10.694 --> 05:14.323
Congratulations and good luck.

05:14.698 --> 05:16.742
Thank you!

06:18.721 --> 06:21.473
It's the police!
Hasan, Muhammed!

06:21.724 --> 06:22.891
Hasan, Muhammed!

06:23.058 --> 06:25.728
Quick, man your posts!

06:25.978 --> 06:30.232
Take your places. It's a raid!

06:37.614 --> 06:41.160
The birds are in the cage.
Start the operation.

07:00.137 --> 07:02.014
Acar!

07:39.551 --> 07:41.136
RPG!

07:56.819 --> 07:58.445
Acar, the balcony!

08:03.534 --> 08:05.035
We're going in.

08:07.162 --> 08:09.540
Come on.

09:00.341 --> 09:01.508
Grenade!

09:04.386 --> 09:05.929
Quick. Hurry!

10:37.688 --> 10:38.814
Acar!

11:03.714 --> 11:06.008
Remzi! Remzi!

11:37.665 --> 11:39.917
Mahmut, is the operation over?

11:40.209 --> 11:41.585
Yes, sir. /

11:42.002 --> 11:43.671
How'd it go?

11:44.630 --> 11:47.675
We've lost six men.
Remzi is dead.

11:51.136 --> 11:52.721
My condolences.

11:53.263 --> 11:55.265
We've also got two men injured.

11:56.600 --> 12:00.187
18 terrorists are dead, sir.

12:01.230 --> 12:02.272
All right, Mahmut.

12:03.399 --> 12:05.985
I'm certain they have support from overseas. /

12:06.568 --> 12:09.363
We must find out who it is. /

14:57.531 --> 15:01.410
Let's collect some more donations
for our Palestinian brothers.

15:01.660 --> 15:04.955
Metin and Cemil,
go visit the congregation.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.874
Baki, go to the Koran courses.

15:07.082 --> 15:11.837
Burhan, take Ömer and go see our
nationalist brothers.

15:12.588 --> 15:14.173
Godspeed.

15:14.381 --> 15:16.008
Peace be upon you.

15:25.017 --> 15:31.899
As nationalist Turkish youth,
we vow to fight against communism, fascism...

15:32.232 --> 15:35.653
...capitalism, Zionism...

15:35.861 --> 15:39.573
...and all forms of imperialism...

15:40.074 --> 15:45.162
...to our last soldier, last breath...

15:45.496 --> 15:48.999
...and last drop of blood.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.293
Our struggle...

15:51.502 --> 15:56.382
...will continue until
all Turkic people are united.

15:56.674 --> 15:58.884
We are undaunted.

15:59.134 --> 16:01.303
We will not give up!

16:01.512 --> 16:03.472
We will succeed.

16:03.681 --> 16:08.477
We will succeed.

16:10.062 --> 16:11.897
May Allah protect us and empower us.

16:12.106 --> 16:13.732
Amen.

16:20.239 --> 16:21.657
Welcome hodjas.

16:21.657 --> 16:22.992
Thank you.

16:23.325 --> 16:24.702
How may I be of service?

16:24.910 --> 16:26.662
The Hodja sent us.

16:26.870 --> 16:30.791
In the name of Allah, our brothers
in Palestine need your help.

16:31.041 --> 16:34.169
May the Lord reward
your good deeds.

16:34.378 --> 16:37.840
We're ready to help our
Palestinian brothers in any way we can.

16:39.133 --> 16:41.302
Just give us two days.

16:41.969 --> 16:44.305
May God bless your generosity.

16:44.513 --> 16:45.848
Godspeed.

16:46.682 --> 16:48.851
Thank you, May God watch over you.

16:49.268 --> 16:50.436
Thank you.

16:57.151 --> 17:01.238
Ömer, I'm going shopping
with the boys. Peace be upon you.

17:01.864 --> 17:03.032
Goodbye.

17:03.449 --> 17:04.491
Thank you.

17:13.416 --> 17:14.877
Yes.

17:19.048 --> 17:20.758
Yes, sir.

17:35.105 --> 17:36.148
Tea man!

17:36.357 --> 17:39.985
Since when do we serve sect
members?

17:41.570 --> 17:43.280
What are you looking at!

17:43.656 --> 17:45.407
- They're expecting you.
- Me?

17:45.658 --> 17:47.326
Both of you.

18:00.172 --> 18:02.549
Here they come.

18:08.097 --> 18:09.682
Have a seat.

18:15.562 --> 18:18.315
Do you two know each other?

18:19.149 --> 18:21.735
Fýrat Baran. Acar Aydýn.

18:22.194 --> 18:24.238
Sorry. I didn't recognize you
out there. I apologize.

18:24.488 --> 18:25.739
It doesn't matter.

18:25.948 --> 18:27.992
Fýrat, what's going on with
the congregation?

18:28.200 --> 18:29.827
- They're clean, chief.
- Good.

18:30.077 --> 18:32.871
I'm sending you both
to New York for a couple of days.

18:33.038 --> 18:34.164
Oðuz.

18:36.041 --> 18:39.211
Here he is, the guy we've been after
all these years: Dajjal.

18:39.545 --> 18:43.465
The FBI just arrested him in New York.
This picture was taken yesterday.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.218
They caught our guy in America.

18:46.385 --> 18:48.429
He's got a store in Soho.

18:48.637 --> 18:52.057
It's interesting. We're told...

18:52.266 --> 18:54.435
...he doesn't have a criminal record.

18:54.685 --> 19:00.441
And because Dajjal hasn't been
mixed up in any terrorist or criminal...

19:00.858 --> 19:04.987
...activities over there, the Americans
are extraditing him to Turkey to stand trial.

19:05.946 --> 19:08.407
Fýrat, thanks to your hard work...

19:08.615 --> 19:11.785
...we've uncovered
Dajjal's true identity.

19:12.161 --> 19:15.122
But I don't approve of your methods.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.713
Talk! Hadji Gümüþ is Dajjal,
isn't he?

19:22.880 --> 19:24.590
I told you I don't know.

19:25.007 --> 19:29.053
Tell me! Dajjal is Hadji Gümüþ,
isn't he? Isn't he!

19:29.219 --> 19:30.763
Yes. He is Dajjal.

19:32.222 --> 19:33.682
I'll ask you one last time.

19:33.891 --> 19:35.684
Dajjal is Hadji Gümüþ.

19:36.101 --> 19:37.102
I didn't catch that.

19:37.436 --> 19:39.897
Hadji Gümüþ is Dajjal.

19:40.397 --> 19:41.398
Fýrat.

19:41.607 --> 19:43.525
Everything's fine, sir.
He talked.

19:43.734 --> 19:46.320
Dajjal is Hadji Gümüþ.

19:48.447 --> 19:52.159
Dajjal is Arabic for "Antichrist".
The false prophet expected to wreak havoc...

19:52.368 --> 19:54.662
...just before Judgment Day.

23:13.319 --> 23:15.362
Hello. Firat, my boy.

23:15.696 --> 23:16.947
Are you well?

23:17.781 --> 23:21.952
I'm fine, grandfather.
How are you?

23:22.661 --> 23:24.371
Is something wrong, son?

23:24.580 --> 23:26.832
Grandfather, I'm going to America.

23:27.041 --> 23:29.752
America?

23:30.377 --> 23:32.463
My thoughts are with you.

23:34.131 --> 23:37.343
Be safe.

23:38.177 --> 23:40.971
Yes, grandfather.
Don't worry.

23:41.639 --> 23:43.390
Alright, my boy.

24:12.628 --> 24:16.840
I was 28 when the police force
sent me here for training.

24:17.758 --> 24:20.386
I had a good time here.

24:22.930 --> 24:26.642
What's the matter?
You don't like America?

24:27.559 --> 24:30.145
Mind your own business.

26:06.992 --> 26:08.577
Do you speak Kurdish?

26:11.246 --> 26:11.955
Yes.

26:12.206 --> 26:13.499
How're you?

26:14.333 --> 26:15.793
I'm fine.

26:16.669 --> 26:18.712
How did you learn Kurdish?

26:35.604 --> 26:37.189
- What's he saying?
- Just a second.

27:09.513 --> 27:11.432
What's he saying?

27:18.439 --> 27:19.565
Let's go.

27:35.748 --> 27:39.168
The guy hates Islam.
They think...

27:39.335 --> 27:43.130
...anyone who's against them is a terrorist.
He really pissed me off.

28:03.651 --> 28:05.694
Peace be with you.

28:05.944 --> 28:08.530
Peace be upon you, Hadji Gümüþ!

28:48.320 --> 28:50.698
Tell them we're also getting
into that vehicle.

30:33.217 --> 30:37.221
You're a real legend back at
headquarters, Hadji. Keep praying.

30:41.725 --> 30:43.811
Shut your mouth, Hadji.

31:50.377 --> 31:53.213
- Are you alright?
- I'm fine.

32:27.331 --> 32:30.292
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

32:30.709 --> 32:32.920
- Sir, something happened.
- Nothing bad I hope, Yasin.

32:33.170 --> 32:34.672
Some trouble in America.

32:34.880 --> 32:36.966
Dajjal's escaped on the way to the airport.

32:37.132 --> 32:38.509
What!

32:45.099 --> 32:48.852
That is all we know right now.
I'll keep you posted.

32:50.771 --> 32:52.147
Alright.

33:20.342 --> 33:21.093
What's he saying?

33:21.093 --> 33:22.803
That we're guests, and we can' get involved.

33:23.012 --> 33:24.388
I'm gonna let him have it!

33:25.347 --> 33:27.433
Tell them we're going with them.

38:09.632 --> 38:11.634
Are you all right, sir?

38:12.926 --> 38:15.387
The FBI asked about you.

38:16.055 --> 38:18.641
There were two Turkish cops with them.

38:19.933 --> 38:23.520
I told them I didn't know anything.

38:23.937 --> 38:26.440
Understood.

40:03.454 --> 40:04.622
- Look, I'm Turkish too.
- Talk!

40:04.830 --> 40:07.583
- You broke in without a warrant.
- Tell me where Hadji is!

40:14.173 --> 40:17.217
- Talk!
- I don't know where he is, I swear!

40:17.426 --> 40:21.472
- What did you say?
- I really don't know.

41:25.995 --> 41:27.871
- Are you gonna talk?
- I really don't know.

41:35.754 --> 41:37.840
Fýrat! Fýrat!

41:40.801 --> 41:42.136
Fýrat!

41:47.099 --> 41:48.434
Take your last breath.

41:48.726 --> 41:50.811
Ok. I'll tell you.

44:02.943 --> 44:04.111
Which way?

44:04.320 --> 44:05.696
This way.

44:18.584 --> 44:20.586
- Where?
- Here.

44:35.017 --> 44:37.436
What the hell is this?

45:02.836 --> 45:03.963
Bastard.

45:26.735 --> 45:28.070
What are they saying?

45:46.880 --> 45:48.048
Let me go!

47:17.471 --> 47:19.181
Peace be with you.

47:25.437 --> 47:28.941
Is it not a sin to torture an innocent boy
just because he works for me?

47:29.108 --> 47:32.945
So here I am. What have I done wrong?
What am I accused of?

47:33.153 --> 47:35.447
You know what you've done.

47:36.824 --> 47:39.827
I'll be on your tail until you kill me.

47:40.494 --> 47:43.664
Kill? God forbid.

47:45.249 --> 47:49.211
God says:
"He who deliberately kills...

47:49.586 --> 47:53.340
...shall be condemned to Hell
for all eternity."

47:54.258 --> 47:55.050
That is:

47:55.801 --> 48:02.099
"He who deliberately kills shall be
condemned to Hell for all eternity."

48:02.850 --> 48:07.980
Hadji, don't you dare quote
the scripture to me.

48:11.900 --> 48:14.611
So, you know the Koran.

48:21.952 --> 48:24.538
I'm going to make a deal with you.

48:25.581 --> 48:30.294
You'll be my guests for a few days.
Then I'll do whatever you want.

51:27.930 --> 51:29.056
My wife, Maria.

51:34.103 --> 51:36.522
Hello. Welcome.

51:38.023 --> 51:39.108
Thank you.

51:40.943 --> 51:43.988
Greetings. How are you?

52:01.213 --> 52:02.506
Good night.

52:03.132 --> 52:04.925
Good night.

52:08.429 --> 52:12.349
Praise Allah in these difficult days.

52:13.267 --> 52:15.102
Hodja...

52:16.729 --> 52:18.564
...is your wife Christian?

52:18.772 --> 52:20.065
Yes.

52:20.316 --> 52:23.652
But how? Isn't that contrary to Islam?

52:25.571 --> 52:28.032
God is one, my son.

52:28.407 --> 52:32.328
No matter our religion, don't we all
seek to become closer to God?

52:33.245 --> 52:36.707
Our sins and virtues are intrinsic to us all.

52:37.041 --> 52:41.629
Only He may judge us.
The scriptures say:

52:47.134 --> 52:49.053
There is no coercion in religion.

52:52.222 --> 52:55.184
Thou shall not use force.

52:56.393 --> 52:58.520
What do you think about Islamic terror?

52:58.812 --> 53:01.940
Terrorism is the most despicable
human act in the universe.

53:02.358 --> 53:07.404
No religion or belief is so disgraceful
that it would embrace terrorism.

53:07.863 --> 53:12.034
True Muslims can only be on the side
of serenity and peace.

53:12.993 --> 53:16.538
Anyone who's become involved
in terrorism is no longer a Muslim.

53:36.558 --> 53:39.979
It's late. My friends will take care of you.

53:42.982 --> 53:44.692
Good night.

53:46.986 --> 53:49.488
Fýrat, there's something odd
about all this, isn't there?

53:49.697 --> 53:53.450
Look, he's just stalling us.

53:54.243 --> 53:57.162
Don't believe a thing he says.

56:43.412 --> 56:45.956
Haven't you slept, son?

56:46.790 --> 56:48.292
Don't call me son, Hadji.

56:48.500 --> 56:52.379
I don't know what you're accusing me of,
but I'm innocent.

56:55.257 --> 56:59.178
Innocent? Don't lie to me, Hadji!

56:59.345 --> 57:02.264
God forbid. I never lie, my son.

57:02.640 --> 57:04.391
I told you not to call me son.

57:04.516 --> 57:07.353
I know you've killed people.

57:08.646 --> 57:10.606
May God protect me from such a sin.

57:10.814 --> 57:14.944
Sin? You're a sinner
and a murderer, Hadji.

57:18.739 --> 57:21.033
Call me what you will, but not a killer.

57:21.283 --> 57:25.287
What are you doing in America?
What brought you here?

57:29.208 --> 57:33.379
The great thinker Said-i Nursi, from
the village of Nurs, in Bitlis had a wise saying:

57:34.338 --> 57:36.840
"Mankind has three problems:

57:37.466 --> 57:41.512
Discrimination, poverty and ignorance.

57:42.513 --> 57:47.184
Discrimination can be solved
with love and compassion, poverty with sharing...

57:47.559 --> 57:51.105
...and ignorance can only be resolved
by education."

57:51.730 --> 57:56.026
I came here because of the ignorance
of my family in Bitlis.

57:56.360 --> 57:59.613
What does any of this have to do
with your family?

58:02.574 --> 58:06.412
Ambition and a thirst for vengeance
will destroy a man.

58:07.246 --> 58:10.833
When we return to Turkey
you will see that I am innocent.

58:11.166 --> 58:14.962
By the grace of God...

58:15.170 --> 58:19.174
...I will see Bitlis
and my mother before I die.

59:24.198 --> 59:30.079
We're both able to figure people
out at a glance. We've got the wrong guy.

01:04:09.316 --> 01:04:12.403
Your father loves you so much.

01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:06.957
Friends, I've caused you a great
deal of trouble too.

01:05:07.249 --> 01:05:11.754
I believe in divine justice.
We can go now.

01:05:18.761 --> 01:05:22.598
Fýrat, come here for a second.
We need to talk.

01:05:27.853 --> 01:05:30.981
We both know we've got
the wrong guy.

01:05:32.274 --> 01:05:34.234
We what?

01:05:36.153 --> 01:05:38.697
If we take Hadji to Turkey
that'll be the end of him.

01:05:38.906 --> 01:05:41.492
Justice isn't blind in our country.
You know that.

01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:43.410
This isn't our guy.

01:05:43.577 --> 01:05:46.997
Have you lost your wits?
Who made you judge?

01:06:43.345 --> 01:06:44.388
What is going on?

01:07:28.307 --> 01:07:29.433
Tell me what they're saying.

01:07:32.811 --> 01:07:35.981
They want us to hide Hadji
up on the roof.

01:07:36.899 --> 01:07:39.318
It's your call.

01:07:44.573 --> 01:07:47.201
Tell them to give us
back our weapons.

01:07:53.207 --> 01:07:54.792
Come on Hadji.

01:07:58.003 --> 01:07:59.588
This way.

01:09:14.162 --> 01:09:17.124
Look me in the eye, Hadji.

01:09:17.582 --> 01:09:20.836
And tell me.
Have you ever killed before, or not?

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:24.965
- I've never shot anyone, my son.
- Don't call me son.

01:09:25.174 --> 01:09:27.968
I know you're a murderer.

01:09:28.636 --> 01:09:30.345
I told you, I never shot anyone.

01:09:30.554 --> 01:09:35.142
- I'm no murderer.
- Hadji, tell me the truth.

01:09:36.018 --> 01:09:38.354
Time to confess. Admit it Hadji.

01:09:38.687 --> 01:09:41.607
Fýrat, have you lost your mind?
Lower that gun.

01:09:41.814 --> 01:09:44.234
They'll shoot all three of us.
Lower your gun.

01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:53.118
In the name of God, tell the truth!

01:09:53.327 --> 01:09:56.872
Are you a killer or not?
For the last time admit it.

01:10:00.292 --> 01:10:01.961
Hadji.

01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:10.678
On your knees, Hadji.

01:12:07.461 --> 01:12:09.755
Welcome home, boys.
I'm proud of you.

01:12:10.047 --> 01:12:12.758
This way. The car's waiting.

01:12:19.890 --> 01:12:24.728
If we get this man to talk
everything will unravel.

01:12:25.479 --> 01:12:27.982
Sooner or later, he'll talk.

01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:30.985
Hello, Hadji.

01:12:32.027 --> 01:12:33.112
Peace be with you.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:37.449
Peace be upon you, Hadji.
How was the flight?

01:12:38.033 --> 01:12:39.326
Fine.

01:13:36.133 --> 01:13:39.011
I haven't set foot in my country
for 37 years.

01:13:39.178 --> 01:13:44.767
You're lying! You've been to Iran, Sudan,
Malaysia,

01:13:45.017 --> 01:13:46.143
You're lying.

01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:49.772
Who are your connections in Turkey?
Who are you in touch with here?

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:54.151
When and how did your order
the assassinations and the bombings?

01:13:54.401 --> 01:13:57.488
I haven't given anyone any orders.

01:13:57.655 --> 01:14:02.159
Do you deny instigating and financing
terrorist activities?

01:14:02.743 --> 01:14:03.535
I do.

01:14:03.744 --> 01:14:09.458
That's not what we've been told by...

01:14:09.667 --> 01:14:14.713
...all the dead journalists:
Gani Baþar, Kenan Demir and Dursun Mutlu.

01:14:14.964 --> 01:14:19.969
Don't confuse me with those who
tarnish the name of Islam.

01:14:20.177 --> 01:14:24.723
All you telling us all our evidence
is wrong? You're a fundamentalist!

01:14:24.932 --> 01:14:28.560
Mahmut! He'll talk.

01:14:30.521 --> 01:14:36.610
Look, you're a believer.
Don't push us into committing a sin.

01:14:37.444 --> 01:14:41.615
We've all got families.

01:16:02.112 --> 01:16:06.742
Al-Qaeda? The Taliban? Hezbollah?
Which one are you affiliated with?

01:16:06.992 --> 01:16:08.285
I'm affiliated with God.

01:16:08.535 --> 01:16:12.915
You're testing our patience!

01:16:13.123 --> 01:16:15.000
Don't push us, Hadji.

01:16:15.167 --> 01:16:17.336
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.214
- Has he squealed yet?
- No.

01:16:20.422 --> 01:16:24.218
Do you confess to attempting
to overthrow the secular order...

01:16:24.385 --> 01:16:29.765
...and resorting to
murder and torture to spread Sharia?

01:16:31.433 --> 01:16:33.602
I'd never confess to that.

01:16:34.228 --> 01:16:38.524
I swear to God, I'm not your man.

01:16:38.774 --> 01:16:41.568
Stop lying, Hadji.

01:16:41.777 --> 01:16:44.446
I don't lie.

01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.005
We know you, Hadji Gümüþ.

01:17:02.965 --> 01:17:07.011
How can you make us believe
you're not guilty of these crimes?

01:17:07.594 --> 01:17:09.805
God sees everything.

01:17:11.140 --> 01:17:13.892
Your past is your past.

01:17:15.269 --> 01:17:20.899
I'm telling you I'm innocent.
But you won't believe me.

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:41.378
I'm starting to wonder about this guy.
What do you think?

01:17:41.587 --> 01:17:46.175
We've been interrogating him since day one.
He should have cracked by now.

01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:50.971
You're tired. Go rest.

01:17:51.180 --> 01:17:53.474
Thanks.

01:17:54.516 --> 01:17:57.853
Sir, Hadji might talk to me.

01:17:58.938 --> 01:18:01.941
Sure, give it a try. Good luck.

01:18:02.107 --> 01:18:03.984
Thank you, sir.

01:18:09.073 --> 01:18:11.867
Fatih, go on, get something to eat.

01:18:32.179 --> 01:18:33.722
Hadji, wake up.

01:18:39.603 --> 01:18:41.272
It's just us.

01:18:41.981 --> 01:18:44.608
There is no escape from your sins.

01:18:44.775 --> 01:18:47.319
God sees all, my son.

01:18:47.778 --> 01:18:50.072
Don't call me son.

01:18:50.447 --> 01:18:53.909
I'm innocent.
What do you want from me, son?

01:18:54.076 --> 01:18:57.871
I'm telling you for the last time,
don't call me 'son'!

01:18:58.205 --> 01:19:01.792
Hadji, did you not kill a man in 1973?

01:19:02.334 --> 01:19:08.007
Did you not disappear in 1974,
after being released through a general amnesty?

01:19:09.508 --> 01:19:15.472
1973, in Bitlis.
Do you remember, Hadji Gümüþ?

01:19:16.932 --> 01:19:19.518
I've never forgotten.

01:19:21.604 --> 01:19:26.317
I know you're a lowlife. A killer.

01:19:27.067 --> 01:19:31.447
- Don't call me that.
- Don't lie to me, Hadji.

01:19:34.908 --> 01:19:37.536
Then listen to me.

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:42.374
I was still a child.

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:48.589
I left the mosque with a Koran.

01:19:50.716 --> 01:19:53.927
My older brother came up to me.

01:19:58.849 --> 01:20:05.564
Fellow Muslims, anyone who says
violence has no place in Islam...

01:20:06.106 --> 01:20:13.614
...is an infidel, who doesn't know
the meaning of jihad.

01:20:15.282 --> 01:20:22.122
To ensure the dominance of Islam,
you must be prepared for torture and death!

01:20:22.581 --> 01:20:28.087
Death on the path of Allah is not death:
It's resurrection.

01:20:29.713 --> 01:20:32.383
May Allah be with you.

01:20:32.716 --> 01:20:33.759
Amen.

01:20:33.926 --> 01:20:35.678
God is great!

01:20:35.844 --> 01:20:37.554
God is great!

01:20:37.763 --> 01:20:39.306
God is great!

01:20:39.515 --> 01:20:40.891
God is great!

01:20:50.859 --> 01:20:53.862
My Sheik, we got the new orders.

01:20:54.071 --> 01:20:56.699
- Good.
- We visited the Muslims as instructed...

01:20:57.116 --> 01:20:59.994
...but no one gave donations.

01:21:00.202 --> 01:21:07.001
Is that so? As we battle for Islam have those
degenerates turned their backs on us?

01:21:07.418 --> 01:21:10.963
They've yielded to temptation and lost faith.

01:21:11.297 --> 01:21:13.340
Let's punish them.

01:21:13.716 --> 01:21:16.969
Patience. We need to be patient.

01:21:17.886 --> 01:21:19.138
Alright.

01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:51.337
This is the infidel cop who informed on us.

01:21:57.134 --> 01:21:58.552
Hamza!

01:23:04.493 --> 01:23:07.371
Hello. Are you back, son?

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.624
- I'm back, grandfather.
- Welcome back.

01:23:10.791 --> 01:23:14.586
I've been unable to sleep much recently.

01:23:15.421 --> 01:23:17.423
How did it go?

01:23:22.136 --> 01:23:25.597
- Grandfather, are you well?
- No, I'm not.

01:23:26.890 --> 01:23:29.727
I'm on this earth today, gone tomorrow.

01:23:30.102 --> 01:23:33.022
Put me at ease before I die.

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:41.655
- Be at ease, grandfather!
- Goodbye.

01:23:53.626 --> 01:23:55.628
Hadji's innocent.

01:23:57.046 --> 01:24:00.758
What are you talking about?
What makes you think that?

01:24:01.175 --> 01:24:02.551
He's innocent.

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:07.431
They used us - used me -
to protect the real Dajjal.

01:24:08.182 --> 01:24:11.060
What's that supposed to mean, Fýrat?

01:24:11.268 --> 01:24:14.313
We contacted Interpol
and had the FBI apprehend him.

01:24:14.563 --> 01:24:16.857
And now you're telling me we have the wrong guy?

01:24:17.066 --> 01:24:22.071
We look like a bunch of fools.
I'd never have expected this from you.

01:24:22.446 --> 01:24:26.533
- Sir.
- Shut up! You screwed up. Get out of my sight.

01:24:33.165 --> 01:24:37.461
Fýrat, how many times
did I tell you he was innocent?

01:24:38.003 --> 01:24:40.506
You wouldn't believe me.

01:24:40.881 --> 01:24:44.385
Anyway, don't beat yourself up.
Good afternoon.

01:24:44.551 --> 01:24:47.596
- Good afternoon, Acar.
- What's wrong with him?

01:24:50.808 --> 01:24:52.309
Sorry for bothering you, sir.

01:24:52.518 --> 01:24:55.312
But it's important.

01:25:07.366 --> 01:25:09.326
It's Salim, sir.

01:25:20.963 --> 01:25:24.883
Those who spill the blood of Muslims
won't go unpunished.

01:25:25.092 --> 01:25:30.472
We will fight the infidels until Palestine,
Iraq and Afghanistan are liberated.

01:25:31.223 --> 01:25:34.727
Collaborators will not be forgiven.

01:25:35.311 --> 01:25:38.397
In the name of Allah. God is great.

01:25:51.994 --> 01:25:53.787
God damn it.

01:27:11.031 --> 01:27:13.909
Don't let it get you down, Fýrat.

01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:16.912
We all make mistakes.

01:27:17.496 --> 01:27:21.041
What difference does it make if it happened
in Istanbul or somewhere else?

01:27:23.836 --> 01:27:28.048
I've spent a lifetime knee-deep in filth
to catch these scum.

01:27:28.257 --> 01:27:30.676
- I'm worn out.
- Me too.

01:27:32.428 --> 01:27:33.679
Excuse me.

01:27:35.306 --> 01:27:36.682
Hello?

01:27:38.309 --> 01:27:39.351
What?

01:27:42.980 --> 01:27:45.399
They caught Dajjal.

01:28:00.664 --> 01:28:02.958
Allah is great. Allah is great.

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:06.045
We're soldiers of God.

01:28:06.503 --> 01:28:08.797
Allah is great.

01:28:44.583 --> 01:28:46.585
Peace be with you.

01:28:50.506 --> 01:28:52.758
Peace be upon you.

01:29:00.557 --> 01:29:03.519
The people who have been using these bastards
to kill our colleagues...

01:29:03.727 --> 01:29:07.648
...think they run the country.

01:29:08.357 --> 01:29:11.485
Find out who's really behind this
and turn them over to...

01:29:11.694 --> 01:29:16.156
...some honest public prosecutors.

01:29:16.365 --> 01:29:17.658
Yes, sir.

01:29:18.158 --> 01:29:20.494
Any news on the Dursun Þahin assassination?

01:29:20.703 --> 01:29:23.455
The suspects have vanished into thin air.

01:29:23.664 --> 01:29:29.461
This country's awash in filth.
I want to see that lowlife.

01:29:42.391 --> 01:29:44.101
You coldblooded bastard.

01:29:44.893 --> 01:29:49.273
Tell me who you're working for.
Who's giving you your orders?

01:29:49.732 --> 01:29:54.320
I take my orders from Allah.
I'm waging holy war on the path of Allah.

01:29:54.528 --> 01:29:56.030
What part of kidnapping...

01:29:56.238 --> 01:29:58.907
...and robbing Muslims, burying them alive...

01:29:59.241 --> 01:30:02.870
...cutting off their heads is holy war?
You piece of shit.

01:30:03.037 --> 01:30:09.460
The Koran instructs us to do battle
until everyone is a Muslim.

01:30:10.085 --> 01:30:20.220
The Prophet Muhammed fought
the enemies of Allah until his dying breath.

01:30:20.512 --> 01:30:21.847
We'll do the same.

01:30:22.097 --> 01:30:25.559
Allah instructed the Prophet to
use persuasion and wisdom...

01:30:25.726 --> 01:30:30.272
...to spread God's word.

01:30:32.650 --> 01:30:39.239
Jihad is simply an invitation to tread the
path of God while seeking the truth.

01:30:41.951 --> 01:30:49.833
When attacked by enemies, our Prophet defended
his life, property and honor.

01:30:51.585 --> 01:30:57.257
In his 23 years as Prophet, he fought
only for two months.

01:31:01.679 --> 01:31:04.556
May God forgive our sins.

01:31:10.729 --> 01:31:12.690
I'm sorry, Hadji.

01:31:13.274 --> 01:31:17.444
I apologize personally
and on behalf of the police force.

01:31:18.070 --> 01:31:21.448
We made a terrible mistake.

01:31:24.576 --> 01:31:26.704
It's God's will.

01:31:52.730 --> 01:31:55.482
I'm glad we worked together.

01:31:55.858 --> 01:31:57.484
Me too, Acar.

01:31:58.777 --> 01:32:01.196
But something still puzzles me.

01:32:01.572 --> 01:32:03.198
I'm listening.

01:32:04.033 --> 01:32:07.161
From the very beginning
you knew he was innocent.

01:32:07.411 --> 01:32:10.247
Why did you insist he was guilty?

01:32:10.956 --> 01:32:14.501
Life's like that.
Sometimes we make mistakes.

01:32:16.086 --> 01:32:18.005
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

01:32:18.464 --> 01:32:19.632
- My condolences.
- Bless you.

01:32:19.882 --> 01:32:21.884
I'm sorry again.

01:32:22.051 --> 01:32:25.054
You followed orders.
It's not your fault.

01:32:25.262 --> 01:32:28.807
Everyone's apologized.
What's done is done.

01:32:29.016 --> 01:32:30.392
What do you intend to do now?

01:32:30.643 --> 01:32:36.482
We'll stay here for a few days.
Then we'll see Marcus off.

01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:40.361
Then, God willing, I'll take my wife to Bitlis...

01:32:40.611 --> 01:32:42.655
...to see my mother.

01:32:42.863 --> 01:32:46.325
Hadji, let us take you to Bitlis.

01:32:46.492 --> 01:32:48.452
- Don't trouble yourself.
- What do you mean?

01:32:48.661 --> 01:32:51.872
You looked after us in New York.
Now it's our turn.

01:36:09.820 --> 01:36:11.572
My son.

01:36:14.575 --> 01:36:19.455
If none of this had happened,
we'd never have come here.

01:36:20.456 --> 01:36:21.999
Thank you.

01:36:22.916 --> 01:36:24.501
I've missed Bitlis.

01:36:24.501 --> 01:36:27.963
If you missed it,
why didn't you come earlier?

01:36:28.714 --> 01:36:33.469
I didn't want to stir up old problems.

01:36:34.386 --> 01:36:38.515
But I should have come here a long time ago.

01:39:02.743 --> 01:39:03.911
Anyone home?

01:39:07.122 --> 01:39:08.707
Anyone home?

01:39:15.422 --> 01:39:20.302
What is it? Who are you looking for?

01:39:27.893 --> 01:39:29.853
Ask if there is a hotel around here.

01:39:30.062 --> 01:39:32.022
Is there a hotel around here?

01:39:32.231 --> 01:39:36.026
In these parts, if someone
asks for a hotel...

01:39:36.235 --> 01:39:43.325
...we put them up in our homes.
You're a guest of God.

01:39:44.076 --> 01:39:46.912
- Welcome.
- Don't trouble yourself.

01:39:47.079 --> 01:39:50.249
It's no trouble. Come in.

01:39:50.791 --> 01:39:53.669
Please excuse me for a minute.
I'll be back soon.

01:40:05.472 --> 01:40:07.182
What is it?

01:40:07.349 --> 01:40:10.853
Fýrat lied to us all.

01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:12.313
What?

01:40:12.563 --> 01:40:15.608
We went through his files for the report.

01:40:16.066 --> 01:40:16.984
And?

01:40:17.192 --> 01:40:20.029
He changed his surname before entering the force.

01:40:20.237 --> 01:40:26.619
His father is Ýsmail Eren. It was his father
that Hadji Gümüþ shot in 1973.

01:40:26.952 --> 01:40:29.538
Who told us Hadji Gümüþ was Dajjal?

01:40:29.705 --> 01:40:33.584
It was Fýrat. Unable to track down
his father's killer in Turkey...

01:40:33.751 --> 01:40:36.754
...he led us to Hadji Gümüþ
by claiming he was Dajjal.

01:40:37.212 --> 01:40:39.548
Do you realize what you're saying, Mahmut?

01:40:41.133 --> 01:40:43.677
My boy...

01:40:44.261 --> 01:40:46.764
...you brought that scum...

01:40:46.972 --> 01:40:48.807
...back where he killed your father.

01:40:49.016 --> 01:40:53.854
When his blood is on the flag on the roof...

01:40:54.104 --> 01:40:57.733
...your father will finally rest in peace.

01:40:58.525 --> 01:41:02.154
Grandfather, he's not a killer!

01:41:05.532 --> 01:41:10.663
What are talking about?
Do you hear what you're saying?

01:41:12.748 --> 01:41:16.293
He killed your father.

01:41:16.919 --> 01:41:19.505
I know a killer when I see one.

01:41:19.797 --> 01:41:23.968
Hadji told me everything.
He's a good man.

01:41:24.176 --> 01:41:26.679
A good man?

01:41:27.930 --> 01:41:31.517
I've been a mother and father to you.

01:41:32.184 --> 01:41:36.480
It's your duty to avenge your father.
Get out of my sight.

01:41:38.065 --> 01:41:40.359
You're not my grandson anymore!

01:41:40.651 --> 01:41:43.529
I've wasted my life to avenge my father.

01:41:43.737 --> 01:41:46.615
I hunted down an innocent man for years.

01:41:47.074 --> 01:41:51.912
I swear to God and the Koran,
Hadji is innocent.

01:42:01.714 --> 01:42:04.300
Is this true, son?

01:42:04.508 --> 01:42:07.761
He was your son,
but he was my father.

01:42:08.304 --> 01:42:11.515
Hadji is the best person I've ever met.

01:42:16.812 --> 01:42:21.233
You know better.

01:42:21.525 --> 01:42:25.112
I'm sorry I hit you.

01:42:26.947 --> 01:42:30.618
I've got to get back to them.
I won't be late tonight.

01:42:30.909 --> 01:42:36.665
Come home as soon as you can.
We have a lot to talk about. I've missed you.

01:42:40.586 --> 01:42:42.421
See you later, grandfather.

01:42:42.671 --> 01:42:44.381
Ok, son.

01:42:54.308 --> 01:42:55.351
Thank you.

01:42:55.351 --> 01:42:55.976
Thank you.

01:42:59.396 --> 01:43:03.233
Münevver, prepare supper.

01:43:06.528 --> 01:43:13.035
So, how are you? Are you comfortable?

01:43:13.619 --> 01:43:17.873
Come. Sit down and let's talk.

01:43:23.337 --> 01:43:26.006
You're from around here?

01:43:27.508 --> 01:43:29.051
You could say so.

01:43:29.593 --> 01:43:33.097
Why'd you come to Bitlis.

01:43:35.349 --> 01:43:39.144
To visit someone
haven't seen for a long time.

01:43:42.815 --> 01:43:45.359
God willing, you'll be reunited.

01:43:47.569 --> 01:43:48.988
God willing.

01:43:56.203 --> 01:43:59.206
What about your family?

01:44:01.125 --> 01:44:08.757
I had two sons. The older one
died of cancer ten years ago.

01:44:16.390 --> 01:44:18.392
And the younger?

01:44:19.935 --> 01:44:23.147
He was in prison.
He was released...

01:44:25.524 --> 01:44:29.778
...but I never saw him again.

01:44:33.907 --> 01:44:37.036
We've got enemies here.

01:44:38.871 --> 01:44:43.876
I miss him so much.
He's far away.

01:44:45.419 --> 01:44:50.382
But at least he's alive.

01:44:57.389 --> 01:44:59.016
Mother.

01:45:01.018 --> 01:45:02.937
I'm Hadji.

01:45:04.772 --> 01:45:07.566
It's me, Hadji, mother.

01:45:07.816 --> 01:45:10.027
- Hadji?
- Yes.

01:45:13.781 --> 01:45:15.532
It's you.

01:45:17.409 --> 01:45:18.535
My son.

01:45:18.744 --> 01:45:21.705
It's me, mother. Forgive me.

01:45:22.331 --> 01:45:26.168
Hadji.

01:45:27.086 --> 01:45:29.338
My son.

01:45:33.801 --> 01:45:39.306
Praise God.
My dear son, my boy.

01:45:52.194 --> 01:45:54.321
Where have you been?

01:45:54.571 --> 01:45:57.908
Far away, mother.
I'm here now.

01:45:58.158 --> 01:46:00.661
And this is my wife, Maria.

01:46:00.995 --> 01:46:06.583
Welcome to our home, dear girl.

01:46:06.875 --> 01:46:09.003
She doesn't speak Turkish.
And she's Christian.

01:46:09.253 --> 01:46:12.673
It doesn't matter, son.
Everyone is equal.

01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:20.264
Come over here.
Mother, these are my friends.

01:46:20.472 --> 01:46:23.017
Because of them,
I was able to come to Bitlis.

01:46:23.183 --> 01:46:27.730
This is Acar.
And this is Fýrat, also from Bit...

01:46:50.461 --> 01:46:52.546
Grandfather.

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:27.623
Ýsmail.
This is from the Gümüþ family.

01:47:35.923 --> 01:47:37.299
Hadji!

01:48:03.158 --> 01:48:04.451
Take it.

01:48:06.662 --> 01:48:09.206
- I told you to take it.
- Brother, no.

01:48:09.581 --> 01:48:10.916
Take it.

01:48:11.166 --> 01:48:15.963
You did it.
You're the killer.

01:48:19.717 --> 01:48:21.093
Hadji!

01:48:42.156 --> 01:48:43.991
Fýrat.

01:48:46.118 --> 01:48:47.911
Fýrat.

01:48:49.079 --> 01:48:52.416
I love you.

01:48:56.503 --> 01:49:00.633
This all happened because of me.

01:49:02.217 --> 01:49:05.095
Do you know who I am?

01:49:05.888 --> 01:49:09.058
I never forgot those eyes.

01:49:10.142 --> 01:49:13.395
You have your father's eyes.

01:49:18.233 --> 01:49:24.281
Hadji, forgive me.
You're the best person I ever met.

01:49:24.698 --> 01:49:26.408
Forgive me.

01:49:27.034 --> 01:49:31.580
Don't be upset, my son.
It's God's will.

01:49:33.499 --> 01:49:36.502
I fled from ignorance...

01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:40.547
...and now I die from ignorance.

01:49:42.633 --> 01:49:45.636
My wife, my daughter...

01:49:49.014 --> 01:49:50.683
Daugh...
