WEBVTT

02:09.362 --> 02:11.656
- Captain, what's this town called?
- Puerto Miguel.

02:11.864 --> 02:13.366
- Is it alive?
- It's asleep.

02:13.533 --> 02:16.202
When the sun falls people
will get up. They call it a siesta.

02:16.327 --> 02:18.204
Do we have to siesta here
for 4 weeks?

02:18.413 --> 02:20.081
4, 5, 6...

02:20.248 --> 02:22.750
- Take that long to fix an engine?
- Not me. The engineer.

02:22.917 --> 02:25.586
I didn't make the steamboat,
I just operate one.

02:28.423 --> 02:30.716
- Captain, wait!
- Every mother's son...

02:30.800 --> 02:33.719
...is picking up gold by the fistful
in California...

02:34.387 --> 02:37.515
...and I'm marooned in a Mexican
village called Pu...

02:37.723 --> 02:39.809
- What did he call it?
- Puerto Miguel.

02:40.017 --> 02:41.602
Puerto Miguel.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.605
- But what can we do about it?
- Nothing.

02:44.897 --> 02:49.068
- They must have some alcohol.
- I think so.

03:14.635 --> 03:16.095
There we are.

03:17.555 --> 03:19.223
It's a funny thing.

03:19.640 --> 03:24.645
I know everybody on board except you.
I don't know anything about you.

03:25.104 --> 03:28.775
- Your called Hooker and that's it.
- That's it.

03:29.233 --> 03:34.447
That kid thinks he knows you
from Texas, but he can't remember.

03:35.907 --> 03:37.784
Then it couldn't have been much.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.870
And even if it was,
it wouldn't be any of my business.

03:41.037 --> 03:42.371
I can't see how.

03:42.705 --> 03:46.209
Being a professional gambler,
I like to know the people I meet...

03:46.334 --> 03:48.711
...because I might play them sometime.

03:48.836 --> 03:50.922
That's what makes me so inquisitive.

03:51.339 --> 03:54.050
- That's natural.
- I'm also a kind of poet...

03:54.258 --> 03:56.552
...and all kinds of people
interest me.

03:57.762 --> 04:00.139
- That makes sense.
- I see what I can get out of them,

04:00.264 --> 04:04.227
...either their money or their
character, or both.

04:07.396 --> 04:11.150
You've heard of "getting blood
out of a stone", haven't you?

04:11.818 --> 04:14.737
- Yeah.
- That's what I'm getting out of you.

05:19.177 --> 05:21.804
Two drinks.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.348
Two drinks.

05:31.689 --> 05:33.524
This is the way my luck's running.

05:33.691 --> 05:35.068
I can speak two languages,

05:35.193 --> 05:38.321
...but I'm in a country
that isn't one of them.

06:05.264 --> 06:09.644
I found that pretty women
speak the same language everywhere.

06:10.228 --> 06:13.773
- What about the ugly ones?
- I never listened.

06:31.916 --> 06:34.836
It's not as bad as I thought it'd be.
It's worse.

06:46.389 --> 06:51.102
Somebody once said:
"Believe nothing a woman says,

06:51.769 --> 06:54.397
...but believe everything she sings".

06:54.564 --> 06:57.066
- Who said that?
- Me.

07:41.778 --> 07:44.072
What's the trouble with him?

07:57.460 --> 07:58.836
What's he saying?

07:59.128 --> 08:02.256
He disliked the way that man
was looking at his girl.

08:13.935 --> 08:16.854
You see we want to be peaceful
and friendly.

08:17.480 --> 08:19.399
We may be here
for quite a while.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.442
I can handle myself.

08:21.609 --> 08:23.653
- I'm sure of it.
- You think not?

08:23.694 --> 08:26.823
- He just said "he was sure of it".
- Relax, Daly.

08:31.035 --> 08:33.538
It may not be as bad as you think.

08:34.372 --> 08:38.918
We can fish in the mornings,
get drunk in the afternoons...

08:40.002 --> 08:42.088
...and we can play cards at night.

08:42.463 --> 08:46.426
- You might even get lucky.
- Like catching lighting in a bottle.

08:46.676 --> 08:50.179
Fiske, you know what you can do
with a deck of cards?

08:52.473 --> 08:54.142
You can tell my fortune.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.893
Anything you like.

08:58.563 --> 09:01.691
The Red Queen.
That means that...

09:06.237 --> 09:08.114
What do you know.

09:17.915 --> 09:21.794
- What's she saying?
- She's got a mine.

09:21.878 --> 09:25.214
Her husband is trapped in a cave-in.
She wants help to get him out.

09:25.423 --> 09:29.385
- She'll pay 1,000 dollars a man.
- There ain't a man at the bar.

09:35.725 --> 09:39.187
Did you hear what I said?
Did you understand?

09:39.395 --> 09:41.064
He just told us.

09:41.606 --> 09:43.691
I offered them a thousand a piece.

09:44.025 --> 09:46.736
I'll double it for any of you
if you'll help.

09:47.695 --> 09:51.449
A man is lying out there hurt,
maybe dying. An American.

09:52.033 --> 09:55.161
- If that isn't enough...
- The price is right.

09:55.495 --> 09:59.248
- But, why is it so high?
- Is a man's life too high a price?

09:59.457 --> 10:01.959
I didn't put the price on it,
you did.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.629
I don't know what to do
or what to say.

10:04.879 --> 10:09.258
- I've got to get help or he'll die.
- Lady, won't you sit down?

10:09.425 --> 10:13.387
Why will none of them go
even for so much money?

10:13.513 --> 10:17.433
None of them will go out there.
They're afraid of the Indians.

10:18.184 --> 10:21.312
Are you?
You don't look afraid.

10:21.395 --> 10:24.774
Ma'am, the thing I'm afraid off
still hasn't been found.

10:36.160 --> 10:39.914
He says only fools go up there.
He must be one.

10:40.164 --> 10:41.874
He's going with her.

10:44.252 --> 10:47.380
- You said 2,000 dollars?
- You've got it in your hand.

10:49.382 --> 10:53.719
- All right, I'll go.
- 2,000 for each of the rest of you.

10:54.095 --> 10:55.388
You?

10:56.180 --> 10:59.934
Madam, I can live anywhere
in the world for 6 weeks,

11:00.143 --> 11:02.437
...but alone in this town.

11:03.479 --> 11:06.107
Meet me in an hour
at the blacksmith's shop.

11:06.315 --> 11:08.609
I'd like for one of you
to come with me now.

11:08.735 --> 11:09.986
You.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.845
- Are we lost?
- No.

11:36.387 --> 11:38.890
We pass the face of that cliff.

12:28.564 --> 12:29.899
What's this all about?

12:30.316 --> 12:32.402
There's Indians here
and they left a message.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.071
- What does it say?
- It's Apache.

12:35.196 --> 12:37.907
- What else?
- That's enough.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.074
Isn't there another way
we could go back?

14:44.325 --> 14:46.953
- Not that I know of.
- Great.

14:47.829 --> 14:49.705
How did you find this place?

14:50.289 --> 14:53.626
With a map from an old priest
in Sacramento.

14:54.127 --> 14:57.672
- He warned us against it.
- What did he come here for?

14:58.423 --> 14:59.674
For God.

15:01.050 --> 15:03.803
A better reason that ours,
isn't it?

15:47.930 --> 15:50.975
Vicente's marking the trail.

15:51.058 --> 15:53.352
Do you think he'll want
to come back?

15:54.604 --> 15:57.523
He just might want to get back
from this one.

16:04.697 --> 16:07.366
How did you happen to be
in Puerto Miguel?

16:07.784 --> 16:09.952
We came around the Horn
headed for the gold fields.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.954
The ship broke down and we
headed into the port.

16:12.121 --> 16:14.415
- You came together?
- No.

16:14.749 --> 16:17.877
- So, you don't know each other?
- No better than you do.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.886
Look at her.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.893
Taking 4 men like us
to a mountain of gold.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.230
- She took what there was.
- That's true.

16:37.355 --> 16:40.066
The barrel was empty,
she scrapped the bottom.

17:49.135 --> 17:52.722
- How far is this place?
- Several days.

17:55.099 --> 17:57.894
I wonder how she remembers
the way.

17:58.186 --> 18:01.105
- Maybe she's got a good memory.
- No.

18:01.606 --> 18:03.483
No, she's got a map.

18:03.900 --> 18:08.696
She takes it out, unfolds it,
and then puts it away carefully.

18:09.113 --> 18:10.990
When she thinks no one's looking.

18:11.491 --> 18:14.160
- But you were.
- Always.

18:16.412 --> 18:17.580
Look.

18:22.043 --> 18:26.631
You see that? Before this is over,
you'll be just like that horse.

18:26.839 --> 18:29.133
Eating right out of her hand.

18:29.425 --> 18:32.095
Maybe it isn't the woman,
maybe it's the sugar.

19:10.133 --> 19:13.803
Not you, Daly. Me.
I got a better reason.

19:13.928 --> 19:15.805
You telling me what to do?

19:16.848 --> 19:19.142
- Just this once.
- Just once, Hooker.

19:19.308 --> 19:21.602
Nobody ever tells me
what to do.

19:21.769 --> 19:25.064
All right.
This time I'm asking you.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.868
I don't think I like him.

19:37.243 --> 19:40.204
I don't think I like any part of him.
You understand?

19:40.455 --> 19:45.877
- There's nothing more simple.
- And I'm not sure if I like you.

19:48.421 --> 19:51.174
I'm talking.
Don't turn your back on me.

19:55.595 --> 20:00.391
You're right. A man should never
turn his back on you.

20:01.434 --> 20:04.145
Not if he cared for his life.

20:04.771 --> 20:09.567
But I'm a peculiar man.
I don't care.

20:40.098 --> 20:41.974
You followed me,
didn't you?

20:42.558 --> 20:45.561
If you want to know where
you're going, ask me.

20:45.728 --> 20:47.480
You can tell the others too.

20:47.563 --> 20:51.234
Tell them, that without me
they're nowhere, they're lost.

20:51.317 --> 20:54.654
And when you're lost in this country,
you're dead.

20:55.738 --> 20:57.824
Then you won't need that gun.

21:00.535 --> 21:03.246
You underrated me, Hooker.
Don't do it.

21:03.413 --> 21:05.081
I don't think I will.

21:05.331 --> 21:07.750
It looked like a good thing.
It looked like a miracle.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.836
A woman leading you
to a gold mine...

21:09.919 --> 21:12.630
in a country where nobody goes
and anything can happen.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.173
- Go on.
- Did you imagine I thought...

21:14.215 --> 21:16.509
...you were doing this
to save a man's life?

21:16.592 --> 21:19.095
A miserable little thing
like a man's life?

21:19.429 --> 21:22.974
- Are you?
- You don't think so?

21:23.224 --> 21:24.600
I think so.

21:24.851 --> 21:28.604
I think anyone would care
about a man's life being in danger,

21:28.980 --> 21:31.274
...especially if it was
in a gold mine.

22:08.895 --> 22:10.104
Say, Hooker,

22:11.189 --> 22:15.151
...before you became an idiot
looking for gold, what were you?

22:16.402 --> 22:18.279
An idiot without any.

22:29.332 --> 22:31.834
Is he still marking up the way?

22:33.294 --> 22:35.379
I think he's memorizing it.

22:35.713 --> 22:37.006
Are you?

22:39.675 --> 22:41.969
Does he know she's wiped his marks?

22:41.969 --> 22:43.137
I doubt it.

23:20.466 --> 23:22.760
You'd think she'd get tired.

23:23.803 --> 23:26.931
She's like something hammered
out of silver.

23:28.766 --> 23:31.477
Now you, you're made out of leather.

23:32.103 --> 23:34.731
Vicente, volcanic rock.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.733
- And you?
- Words and flesh.

23:36.899 --> 23:39.402
I think I'm the only
human being here.

23:40.319 --> 23:43.489
- She's human.
- How can you tell?

23:43.990 --> 23:47.326
- Because of what's driving her.
- And what is?

23:48.327 --> 23:50.204
That man in the mine.

23:50.413 --> 23:53.332
It makes every mile
and every hour precious.

23:53.624 --> 23:56.961
Well, you sound almost
human yourself.

24:14.270 --> 24:16.147
We'll camp there for tonight.

25:38.312 --> 25:40.398
Not many hours old.

25:42.650 --> 25:45.987
- Some kind of a ceremony or ritual.
- Who?

25:46.654 --> 25:49.991
Apaches.
A new moon last night.

25:50.199 --> 25:51.451
So what?

25:51.617 --> 25:56.539
This is a special month for them.
It's, "The Moon of the White man".

25:56.622 --> 25:59.959
- How do you know?
- He knows everything. Let him talk.

26:00.376 --> 26:03.296
It's from when they wiped out
all the settlements, like this one.

26:03.379 --> 26:07.550
You know, back in that saloon
2,000 seemed like quite a bundle,

26:08.050 --> 26:10.344
...but out here it's dwindling fast.

26:10.428 --> 26:15.224
Don't listen to him, it's a legend
he got from the priest in town.

26:15.349 --> 26:17.935
But he was here.
This was his church.

26:18.227 --> 26:20.730
Do you think they care about us?

26:21.064 --> 26:23.483
They killed those who took
the land and built on it.

26:23.524 --> 26:27.070
People who made homes
and fences and came to stay.

26:27.236 --> 26:31.407
People like us, who hunt for gold
and run away with it,

26:31.699 --> 26:33.785
...do you think we're worth killing?

26:33.910 --> 26:37.663
Maybe you're right when there were
two of you, a man and his wife.

26:37.747 --> 26:40.458
- But now...
- Now you listen to me, all of you.

26:40.625 --> 26:42.919
I hired you
to save a man's life.

26:43.002 --> 26:47.423
It might be a little dangerous,
that's why I paid you good.

26:47.590 --> 26:52.178
If a man's life isn't worth a risk,
tell me how much you want.

26:52.595 --> 26:55.932
Go ahead. Tell me how much more.

27:04.399 --> 27:08.569
- What's eating her?
- She's just tired.

27:09.779 --> 27:11.447
Let's make the coffee.

27:53.781 --> 27:58.161
- She put you in your place.
- All of us.

27:59.829 --> 28:02.123
At first I thought she was
one of those women...

28:02.165 --> 28:07.795
...who come along and fascinate men
without trying or knowing why.

28:08.212 --> 28:09.756
And now what?

28:10.673 --> 28:14.218
She tries and she knows why.

28:15.970 --> 28:19.515
Tell me some more
about this White Man's Moon.

28:20.141 --> 28:22.018
It's an open season.

28:22.185 --> 28:25.104
- On what?
- On you and me.

30:58.758 --> 31:00.218
What do you want?

31:03.012 --> 31:08.267
What you said about quitting
and leaving with the money.

31:08.434 --> 31:10.269
You didn't mean me,
did you?

31:10.436 --> 31:14.607
I didn't come along for that.
They did, but I didn't.

31:15.066 --> 31:17.360
That's all they're after,
but not me.

31:17.443 --> 31:21.197
And don't be afraid of them
because I'm watching them.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.533
I'm with you, Leah.

31:24.033 --> 31:26.369
I know what's going on,
but I'm not with them.

31:26.494 --> 31:29.831
It ain't the money with me,
it's you, you know that?

31:29.914 --> 31:31.999
Take your hands off me.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.627
You animal!

31:37.380 --> 31:38.840
You scum!

32:27.055 --> 32:31.851
Go to bed. We got enough trouble
without your problems. That's all.

32:32.060 --> 32:35.188
- Is it? Is that all?
- You heard me.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.774
What if I say it ain't all?
What if I say it ain't?

32:37.857 --> 32:42.028
- Say what you want.
- All right. I'll say something.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.911
Yeah, I think I'll say something.

32:50.953 --> 32:53.039
I've had a gutful of you,
Hooker.

32:53.247 --> 32:55.750
And I'll say it
the way I talk the best.

32:56.209 --> 32:57.502
Put that way, Daly.

32:57.543 --> 33:00.296
I've killed men like you before.

33:00.588 --> 33:03.299
Yeah. I know about you.

33:04.175 --> 33:06.677
You killed them for rewards
on their head...

33:07.261 --> 33:10.390
...when nothing could be done
except give you the cash.

33:11.224 --> 33:14.352
You shot them at tables
or in their beds.

33:14.894 --> 33:18.231
Wherever their eyes were shut
or their backs turned.

33:19.649 --> 33:21.317
I know about you.

33:22.985 --> 33:25.738
I'll let you square yourself.

33:31.702 --> 33:34.330
Killing a man face to face.

33:34.330 --> 33:35.581
I'm telling you, Hooker.

33:35.915 --> 33:37.166
I'm telling you!

33:37.959 --> 33:39.419
I'm telling you!

34:14.662 --> 34:15.830
Stop it.

34:23.337 --> 34:25.006
Blame yourself.

34:26.048 --> 34:30.219
Don't blame Daly or me,
or anybody but yourself.

34:31.137 --> 34:34.474
- What do you think you're saying?
- I know what I'm saying.

34:35.516 --> 34:36.976
And so do you.

34:38.394 --> 34:42.356
If you want to get where
you're going, get some rest. Go on.

35:07.673 --> 35:11.010
Here. Wash your face.

35:21.562 --> 35:26.150
You'll be all right.
You just made a fool out of yourself.

35:27.276 --> 35:31.697
Don't think it hasn't happened
to anybody else. All of us.

35:34.325 --> 35:36.202
You just didn't understand it.

35:38.204 --> 35:42.583
There's only one thing in her head.
That man out there.

35:43.876 --> 35:45.962
Nothing else.

35:47.004 --> 35:48.548
Now you know.

35:50.925 --> 35:53.219
Why didn't you kill me?

35:53.553 --> 35:55.096
I need you.

35:56.055 --> 35:59.809
You don't need anybody, Hooker.
You don't need any of us.

35:59.934 --> 36:01.352
I will.

36:04.731 --> 36:07.233
We'll all need each other.

36:16.451 --> 36:19.370
Come on, now.
Get to bed.

36:58.451 --> 37:00.703
You got everything fixed now?

37:02.246 --> 37:04.749
It'll hold for a while.

37:05.374 --> 37:09.545
You see how it is? Now she's got
you fighting for her honour.

37:09.754 --> 37:12.882
She's got you going unarmed
against...

37:12.882 --> 37:15.802
...a man she turned into an idiot.

37:16.219 --> 37:19.347
- A boy.
- It was very heroic.

37:19.555 --> 37:23.726
I admired you enormously.
I'm sure she did, too.

37:25.311 --> 37:27.814
Some day, like Salome,

37:28.064 --> 37:32.402
...she'll have you bringing her
the head of Vicente in a frying pan.

37:32.652 --> 37:35.446
- Or yours.
- No, not mine, Hooker.

37:35.822 --> 37:37.698
Mine belongs to you.

37:38.241 --> 37:41.369
- And you know what they say.
- What do they say?

37:41.994 --> 37:44.747
Two heads are better than one.

39:17.757 --> 39:19.008
Take one.

39:22.011 --> 39:23.262
Put it back.

39:36.984 --> 39:38.319
- Yours
- S

39:38.319 --> 39:39.487
Si?

39:41.114 --> 39:43.783
- What's he say?
- He wants to do it again.

39:44.200 --> 39:46.119
Shuffle? Cut?

39:46.494 --> 39:47.787
Cut?

40:21.946 --> 40:25.491
- How far will it be now?
- Tomorrow.

40:27.702 --> 40:30.204
We could ride tonight
and be there in the morning.

40:30.997 --> 40:33.082
Only the horses don't ride.

40:35.501 --> 40:37.837
Do you want to tell me about him?

40:38.254 --> 40:42.008
- Tell you? Tell you what?
- Anything.

40:45.344 --> 40:47.430
He's a mining engineer.

40:48.097 --> 40:52.060
We prospected in California
and we got a map from a priest.

40:52.185 --> 40:55.104
A map of this country,
this place.

40:56.230 --> 40:59.776
It was a boom town once.
A volcano covered it with lava.

41:00.359 --> 41:03.905
Everything except a church steeple
and a mine shaft.

41:05.448 --> 41:08.576
In 3 hours they lost half of God
and most of the gold.

41:08.868 --> 41:12.455
- And they never went back?
- No, they were afraid.

41:12.705 --> 41:13.956
Indians?

41:14.707 --> 41:18.044
Yes, after the volcano
it became sacred to the Indians.

41:18.252 --> 41:22.673
- A place of evil spirits.
- But you don't believe in them.

41:23.424 --> 41:27.178
- Do you?
- I believe in Indians.

42:38.666 --> 42:42.211
That's it. The town buried
in the lava from the volcano,

42:42.253 --> 42:44.338
...and the mine's on the other side.

42:52.847 --> 42:54.098
Let's ride.

43:51.906 --> 43:55.034
He's alive. He's all right.
He's alive.

43:56.411 --> 43:58.287
Here, take it easy.

44:06.379 --> 44:09.507
Be careful. I tried that
and it caved in.

44:10.133 --> 44:13.428
We'll need timbers to support this.
Get some timbers, Daly

44:20.268 --> 44:21.728
Here, try this.

45:13.237 --> 45:15.031
Hold up that end.

45:15.073 --> 45:18.201
- Use this for his feet.
- All right.

45:20.036 --> 45:23.164
- Watch out when you lift his leg.
- Roll him over.

45:31.297 --> 45:34.217
There we go.
Vicente, get on that end.

46:00.284 --> 46:02.161
Take him to the house.

46:19.512 --> 46:21.597
All right, get out.

46:23.266 --> 46:26.519
I want to try and fix his leg
while he's still out.

46:26.561 --> 46:28.438
- I'll help you.
- Take her out.

46:28.688 --> 46:30.022
Come on, let's go.

47:15.735 --> 47:17.278
Leave him alone.

47:42.095 --> 47:43.346
Don't talk.

47:43.429 --> 47:44.680
Don't try.

47:44.847 --> 47:46.307
You'll be all right.

47:50.770 --> 47:53.773
It was right there.
I kept shooting at it.

47:54.107 --> 47:56.359
- I kept missing...
- Don't talk about it now.

47:56.692 --> 47:57.944
You...

48:10.456 --> 48:14.419
You...
You came back.

48:16.796 --> 48:19.966
I'm here. You'll be all right.

48:37.066 --> 48:39.736
He will be, won't he?
He'll be all right?

48:40.111 --> 48:42.363
- He has a fractured leg.
- Is it bad?

48:42.530 --> 48:47.744
I don't know. He'll live.
Get him some hot coffee and soup.

48:48.578 --> 48:50.455
Heat some water and wash him.

49:16.981 --> 49:18.649
How bad is his leg?

49:18.816 --> 49:20.985
- I don't know.
- Can he ride?

49:21.194 --> 49:24.739
- Not sure. Maybe when he's stronger.
- What if he can't?

49:25.490 --> 49:27.784
He'll have to be carried on a litter,

49:27.867 --> 49:29.327
...if he does go.

49:29.869 --> 49:31.746
What do you mean "if "?

49:32.038 --> 49:35.166
He may stay. He's got supplies here.
He came to stay.

49:39.378 --> 49:40.755
Where's Daly?

49:40.880 --> 49:45.760
He's in the mine.
He's digging gold out of the wall.

49:46.052 --> 49:50.056
I told him we'd be staying,
no need to get it all in one day.

49:50.556 --> 49:52.308
He's crazy again.

49:53.267 --> 49:55.770
First it was the woman,
now it's the gold.

49:56.187 --> 49:59.107
He wants one or the other
even if it gets him killed.

49:59.232 --> 50:00.358
It could.

50:02.902 --> 50:06.656
- What will you do?
- Wash up with some water over here.

51:24.400 --> 51:25.860
How is he?

51:26.819 --> 51:28.154
He's sleeping.

51:48.508 --> 51:52.011
- Who's he?
- He came back to help get you out.

51:52.845 --> 51:54.764
He fixed your leg.

52:02.772 --> 52:05.274
- Is it bad?
- I can't tell.

52:06.526 --> 52:07.777
I can.

52:08.820 --> 52:10.363
Just lie there.

52:14.242 --> 52:16.744
I've made you soup and coffee.

52:17.036 --> 52:18.621
I'll get it.

52:19.372 --> 52:22.041
You better stay off of
that awhile, Fuller.

52:32.176 --> 52:35.513
- Where did you find him?
- Puerto Miguel.

52:41.144 --> 52:42.395
Here, drink this.

52:58.035 --> 53:00.288
You found him.

53:00.538 --> 53:03.666
Just like that you found him.

53:04.000 --> 53:05.668
Just like that.

53:06.836 --> 53:11.007
A woman like her
going all the way to Miguel...

53:11.382 --> 53:15.762
...and coming back for me.
Can you imagine that?

53:16.679 --> 53:19.015
- I don't have to.
- I have to.

53:19.182 --> 53:22.935
Days and nights in that black hole
trying to imagine it.

53:23.728 --> 53:26.230
But I had time to think.

53:26.397 --> 53:28.483
And you know what I thought about?

53:28.775 --> 53:30.276
You and me.

53:30.860 --> 53:34.864
And I said to myself:
"Sure, she'll be back".

53:35.364 --> 53:38.367
"She'll be back,
but not for you".

53:38.618 --> 53:41.120
And I knew then that none of it
was ever for me.

53:41.537 --> 53:45.291
From the beginning to the end of it,
in that black hole.

53:45.792 --> 53:48.294
And I knew what a fool I was
to be there...

53:48.336 --> 53:51.881
...and who made me that fool
and why.

53:52.673 --> 53:56.219
It was the gold, Leah.
Never anything else.

53:57.095 --> 53:58.971
I was in love with you.

53:59.472 --> 54:01.641
How could I know that
all you saw in me...

54:01.641 --> 54:03.851
...was someone to risk his life...

54:03.976 --> 54:06.270
...to grovel, to dig?

54:06.604 --> 54:08.898
That's all I ever meant to you.

54:09.107 --> 54:13.069
A pick and shovel
to get your gold.

54:14.487 --> 54:16.864
Yes, I wanted gold.

54:16.906 --> 54:19.409
I wanted all the things it can buy.

54:19.826 --> 54:22.120
Most people do.

54:22.495 --> 54:24.789
I didn't want it like this.

54:39.220 --> 54:40.596
Here, take this.

54:40.805 --> 54:43.391
- Why?
- You want to live, don't you?

54:43.558 --> 54:47.729
- Who cares?
- Just drink it, Fuller.

55:04.704 --> 55:06.789
You falling for it too?

55:07.749 --> 55:11.711
You're next.
You follow me.

55:12.295 --> 55:14.380
I don't follow anybody.

55:15.214 --> 55:18.551
You think I'm wrong.
You think I've gone crazy.

55:18.718 --> 55:20.970
I think you talk too much.

55:21.262 --> 55:25.016
One thing,
you don't have to worry about me.

55:25.767 --> 55:29.520
- I'll try not to.
- Because it's being taken care of.

55:30.688 --> 55:33.816
- What is?
- Me, her, all of you.

55:35.443 --> 55:38.571
They're up there in those hills,
hundreds of them.

55:39.155 --> 55:44.160
They came to the door of the mine
and stood there and looked at me.

55:46.412 --> 55:48.498
You know why they didn't kill me?

55:49.248 --> 55:53.419
Because they couldn't come up
with a worse way to do it.

55:54.587 --> 55:59.592
But they will for you and her
and that scum. You tell her that.

55:59.842 --> 56:04.639
Tell her not to worry about me.
We'll all be murdered together.

56:05.181 --> 56:06.432
Tell her!

56:08.351 --> 56:09.477
Tell her!

56:30.540 --> 56:34.711
Vicente has got a bottle of mescal
in his bag. Would you like some?

56:36.295 --> 56:37.547
No, thanks.

56:38.089 --> 56:40.174
I wouldn't take it too seriously.

56:40.883 --> 56:43.803
He's had a bad time.
He's a bit out of his head.

56:44.303 --> 56:48.057
No, he isn't. He's wanted
to say that for a while.

56:48.391 --> 56:50.059
And he finally said it.

56:50.351 --> 56:53.479
- Is it true?
- It is to him.

56:54.397 --> 56:56.065
What is it to you?

56:59.235 --> 57:02.155
No one is all true to anybody
or anything.

57:02.822 --> 57:06.159
- Some people are.
- Yes? Where are they?

57:06.409 --> 57:10.371
I don't know. I don't move
in those circles. But some men have.

57:10.663 --> 57:12.165
Like this one.

57:13.833 --> 57:16.502
What were you before?
A preacher?

57:16.794 --> 57:18.046
A sheriff.

57:29.807 --> 57:30.975
They're robbing you.

57:31.059 --> 57:33.352
- Did you think they wouldn't?
- No.

57:33.519 --> 57:37.065
When do you get yours?
Or is it yours already?

57:37.690 --> 57:39.984
In a little while
it won't be anybody's.

57:40.693 --> 57:43.029
- Why do you say that?
- We've got company.

57:43.279 --> 57:44.739
Up there in the hills.

57:54.874 --> 57:57.085
- Do the others know?
- They don't know anything.

57:57.251 --> 58:00.171
They just want to get rich
before they die.

58:04.884 --> 58:07.220
Let's go, partner.

58:09.055 --> 58:12.642
- Can you guide them back?
- I'd just go with the sun.

58:12.725 --> 58:14.602
Then get out of here tonight.

58:14.727 --> 58:16.562
I'll build a fire and move around.

58:16.687 --> 58:18.981
It'll fool them long enough
to get a head start.

58:19.065 --> 58:22.235
- And Fuller?
- You take him with you.

58:22.944 --> 58:24.821
I thought you hated each other.

58:25.321 --> 58:26.572
I don't hate him.

58:26.823 --> 58:29.909
- He's trying hard to hate you.
- I know it.

58:31.327 --> 58:35.498
You took him too far.
You took him over his head.

58:35.873 --> 58:38.793
You made a coward of him
and he hates you for it.

58:39.502 --> 58:43.506
It could happen to any man
with a woman like you.

58:44.340 --> 58:47.427
- Any man?
- Well, almost.

58:48.594 --> 58:52.557
There's gold in that shack.
Everything that's been taken out.

58:53.099 --> 58:55.768
It's yours. I'll show you
where it is. You can have it...

58:55.852 --> 58:57.520
...if you take him with you.

59:00.648 --> 59:01.983
I'll tell them.

1:00:10.259 --> 1:00:14.180
- Who's giving the party?
- It's rather impromptu.

1:00:14.722 --> 1:00:19.102
They're inheriting a fortune
from Fuller.

1:00:44.752 --> 1:00:47.255
I hope they don't get tired
of hats.

1:01:02.812 --> 1:01:05.982
- What'd you tell him?
- That when you stop fooling around...

1:01:05.982 --> 1:01:07.567
...you can go up and string
their bows for them.

1:01:07.650 --> 1:01:10.361
- They're up there behind us. Indians.
- How do you know?

1:01:10.403 --> 1:01:12.488
- Fuller.
- He saw them?

1:01:12.572 --> 1:01:15.491
- He's crazy. He's out of his head.
- I'm not.

1:01:15.616 --> 1:01:17.702
- You saw them?
- I saw their smoke.

1:01:20.913 --> 1:01:23.249
Let's get out of here.
What are we waiting for?

1:01:24.375 --> 1:01:27.712
- She has an idea.
- What? What's her idea?

1:01:28.004 --> 1:01:29.380
You want to tell them?

1:01:31.049 --> 1:01:33.259
I thought it'd be better
if you left at night.

1:01:33.551 --> 1:01:37.096
I'll stay and keep a fire going.
They'll think you're still here.

1:01:37.305 --> 1:01:40.516
It'll give you a long time,
a good start.

1:01:44.604 --> 1:01:48.191
I don't get this at all.
What's the trick to this?

1:01:48.441 --> 1:01:50.026
We take Fuller with us.

1:01:52.528 --> 1:01:55.448
- Can he ride?
- If he can't, we'll carry him.

1:01:55.656 --> 1:01:57.325
- Carry him?
- On a litter.

1:01:57.450 --> 1:02:01.621
Are you crazy? You can't carry
him on a litter across that country.

1:02:01.662 --> 1:02:05.083
Ask him.
Ask him if he'll carry Fuller.

1:02:05.375 --> 1:02:08.294
And how about you?
Maybe you and Vicente?

1:02:08.711 --> 1:02:10.963
Besides, why doesn't he stay?

1:02:11.089 --> 1:02:13.466
He risked his life
for a ton of gold, I didn't.

1:02:13.591 --> 1:02:15.134
I'm not losing mine for him.

1:02:15.176 --> 1:02:17.261
You'll lose it if no one stays.

1:02:17.345 --> 1:02:20.890
Can't Fuller stay?
We've all got business in P. Miguel?

1:02:21.057 --> 1:02:23.559
Now, wait a minute.
What she means is...

1:02:23.726 --> 1:02:26.813
...if somebody stays
and moves around the fire,

1:02:27.146 --> 1:02:29.857
...it'll look like we're still here.

1:02:30.233 --> 1:02:31.901
And Fuller can't move.

1:02:32.235 --> 1:02:36.406
You've got no choice because
you only have one chance.

1:02:45.456 --> 1:02:47.333
What's she trying to prove?

1:02:48.418 --> 1:02:52.672
That one of us is a hero
or a fool, or both.

1:02:53.506 --> 1:02:56.843
Anyway, it's her funeral.
I don't go to any but my own.

1:03:00.096 --> 1:03:02.598
You think it's a good idea?

1:03:03.349 --> 1:03:04.767
At least it is one.

1:03:05.685 --> 1:03:07.562
You mean, you let her stay?

1:03:08.229 --> 1:03:10.732
- Why didn't you ask her?
- Ask her, what?

1:03:11.023 --> 1:03:12.692
Ask her if you could.

1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:51.814
I liked your speech out there.

1:03:52.857 --> 1:03:55.359
I thought it had a good idea.

1:03:56.402 --> 1:03:58.488
It was very dramatic too.

1:03:59.822 --> 1:04:04.243
You staying behind to save the life
of the man you once loved.

1:04:05.953 --> 1:04:09.082
I didn't believe the truth
could move you so much.

1:04:09.415 --> 1:04:13.002
- What truth?
- What Fuller told you.

1:04:13.336 --> 1:04:16.464
He couldn't get to you heart
so he got to your pride.

1:04:16.756 --> 1:04:19.425
And you decided to make this play.

1:04:20.134 --> 1:04:21.803
You'll stay behind.

1:04:22.053 --> 1:04:26.432
It isn't that much. A few hours
might give you a whole night.

1:04:26.933 --> 1:04:28.726
Don't make more of it than it is.

1:04:28.726 --> 1:04:29.894
I'm not.

1:04:30.395 --> 1:04:32.688
I'm making it exactly what it is.

1:04:35.024 --> 1:04:38.694
- What are you trying to say?
- That it's a fake...

1:04:38.945 --> 1:04:41.114
A grandstand, a trick.

1:04:41.489 --> 1:04:43.908
That you think no one
will let you stay.

1:04:44.033 --> 1:04:46.786
That you never had the least
intention of staying.

1:04:47.370 --> 1:04:51.791
That no 5 men will ride away
leaving you here for a decoy.

1:04:53.876 --> 1:04:56.546
- You believe that?
- Just like you do.

1:04:57.213 --> 1:04:59.298
But it's a good trick,

1:05:00.049 --> 1:05:01.300
...and it'll work.

1:05:01.634 --> 1:05:02.885
On who?

1:05:03.553 --> 1:05:04.804
On me.

1:05:06.431 --> 1:05:07.890
Because I'm staying with you.

1:05:09.308 --> 1:05:10.435
Why?

1:05:11.978 --> 1:05:13.896
Because I'm a fool.

1:05:15.815 --> 1:05:17.275
Not to me.

1:05:23.239 --> 1:05:24.741
What am I to you?

1:05:25.825 --> 1:05:27.410
Maybe it'll help if I tell you.

1:05:27.452 --> 1:05:28.286
It won't.

1:05:28.327 --> 1:05:30.830
It's easy because it's nothing.

1:05:31.539 --> 1:05:33.207
You're nothing at all.

1:05:33.666 --> 1:05:35.334
Just nothing.

1:05:52.727 --> 1:05:54.395
Another, Leah?

1:05:56.606 --> 1:06:01.027
This one understands you,
but still he can't help it.

1:06:02.987 --> 1:06:06.532
Now I know if I'd have understood
it, I'd have been the same.

1:06:08.201 --> 1:06:12.163
They'll work and kill
and even get killed for you.

1:06:13.414 --> 1:06:17.377
How do you do it, Leah?
What are you?

1:06:19.212 --> 1:06:21.297
I'll get you ready to go.

1:06:22.048 --> 1:06:26.219
You're staying
and he doesn't believe it.

1:06:27.553 --> 1:06:32.350
He doesn't believe in you.
He despises you.

1:06:33.559 --> 1:06:35.478
But he'd stay.

1:06:40.274 --> 1:06:42.568
- Leah.
- Yes.

1:06:45.488 --> 1:06:47.031
So would I.

1:07:17.937 --> 1:07:21.107
I don't need it.
I can ride.

1:07:21.816 --> 1:07:25.153
- I think I can ride.
- All right. Try that horse.

1:07:32.076 --> 1:07:34.162
- Let's get rid of this.
- All right.

1:07:42.420 --> 1:07:45.339
It's all right.
I can ride.

1:07:47.717 --> 1:07:49.510
How long will you stay?

1:07:49.510 --> 1:07:52.221
Don't worry. Here's the map.

1:07:53.222 --> 1:07:56.976
If his leg holds up
we ought to get pretty far.

1:07:57.060 --> 1:07:59.062
What should we do,
stay and gab about it?

1:07:59.228 --> 1:08:01.481
- I don't go for this.
- Then stay out of it.

1:08:01.606 --> 1:08:03.483
It's a little late for that.

1:08:04.067 --> 1:08:06.569
It's too late.
Get on your horse.

1:08:06.861 --> 1:08:08.529
You heard him.

1:08:12.825 --> 1:08:16.329
- Are you sure you want it this way?
- You'd better get going.

1:08:17.330 --> 1:08:18.790
I think you're right.

1:09:29.986 --> 1:09:32.655
This will do.
We'll rest here.

1:09:33.656 --> 1:09:36.576
On the dead run we don't have
too good a chance.

1:09:36.784 --> 1:09:41.164
With this cripple along to slow us
down. Now you want to camp.

1:09:41.748 --> 1:09:44.250
We're going to rest.
He's exhausted.

1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:48.046
He can rest later.
I say we keep moving.

1:09:48.463 --> 1:09:51.007
If that's what you think, go ahead.

1:09:51.049 --> 1:09:53.760
Alone? Followed by Indians?

1:09:55.428 --> 1:09:58.097
You've got a sack of gold,
buy them off.

1:10:31.464 --> 1:10:34.217
- I'll build a fire and make coffee.
- No fire.

1:10:34.550 --> 1:10:36.844
Don't you think they
know where we are?

1:10:37.970 --> 1:10:41.724
Or how you came
or how you'll have to go back?

1:10:42.850 --> 1:10:47.230
This isn't your best chance.
You have to ride and fight for it.

1:10:48.564 --> 1:10:52.318
But you'd have to get rid of me.
Have you thought about that?

1:10:52.568 --> 1:10:55.488
- I haven't.
- No, but they have.

1:10:56.989 --> 1:10:59.075
That young one has,
hasn't he?

1:11:00.827 --> 1:11:03.538
Why don't you answer?
Why don't you say it?

1:11:03.705 --> 1:11:08.167
All right, I'll say it.
You have to cry like a sick cat.

1:11:08.418 --> 1:11:11.212
How many times
will you have to die?

1:11:11.462 --> 1:11:14.382
You never wanted to share
your gold.

1:11:14.549 --> 1:11:17.051
What do you want them to share
your death with you for?

1:11:18.761 --> 1:11:20.847
Somebody else got something to say?

1:11:24.767 --> 1:11:28.312
Fiske, Vicente,
watch that end of the ridge.

1:11:29.939 --> 1:11:31.816
You, take this end.

1:12:42.428 --> 1:12:45.598
He's really not like this.
He's not this way.

1:12:47.016 --> 1:12:50.353
- None of us are.
- You are.

1:12:54.690 --> 1:12:56.567
I'll go fix some food.

1:14:10.808 --> 1:14:11.976
Come here.

1:14:19.484 --> 1:14:22.820
You want to get rid of me?
You hate me enough.

1:14:23.196 --> 1:14:25.865
I don't care about you
one way or the other,

1:14:26.157 --> 1:14:28.951
...but we might get out of here
and you're blocking it.

1:14:29.035 --> 1:14:32.330
I won't any more.
Help me with a horse.

1:14:32.455 --> 1:14:36.000
- Where you going?
- What does that matter to you?

1:14:36.209 --> 1:14:37.460
Nothing

1:15:19.961 --> 1:15:21.421
Hold it, Daly.

1:16:07.467 --> 1:16:10.136
He's dead.
He let Fuller get away.

1:16:22.648 --> 1:16:26.444
- Why didn't you stop him?
- I tried. Get on your horse.

1:16:29.822 --> 1:16:31.282
Hooker, here.

1:16:34.327 --> 1:16:37.663
Why don't they take us?
What are they waiting for?

1:16:37.914 --> 1:16:39.457
Maybe they like it this way,

1:16:39.457 --> 1:16:42.377
...one at a time in a place they pick.

1:17:06.651 --> 1:17:07.944
John!

1:17:42.437 --> 1:17:44.939
Don't look, it's no use.

1:18:18.556 --> 1:18:19.807
Hooker.

1:18:27.690 --> 1:18:28.941
Easy.

1:19:42.473 --> 1:19:44.350
This ought to do.

1:19:49.021 --> 1:19:51.733
- Coffee?
- No fire.

1:19:52.024 --> 1:19:53.276
No coffee.

1:19:55.027 --> 1:19:56.904
There's a little cave over there.

1:19:57.071 --> 1:20:00.491
I could build a fire in it,
cook something warm for her.

1:20:00.700 --> 1:20:04.662
- Do you think we ought to?
- It doesn't matter any more.

1:20:05.329 --> 1:20:07.206
Go ahead. We'll camp.

1:21:28.204 --> 1:21:31.290
- You couldn't sleep either?
- I did for awhile.

1:21:36.212 --> 1:21:38.923
Every time I close my eyes
I see that cross.

1:21:41.175 --> 1:21:46.180
I didn't think he hated me that much.
That he couldn't stay near me.

1:21:47.265 --> 1:21:51.018
Maybe he didn't.
Maybe he loved you.

1:21:51.561 --> 1:21:53.229
After all he said?

1:21:53.563 --> 1:21:58.151
After all any man says,
it's what he does that counts.

1:21:59.068 --> 1:22:01.320
- How do you mean?
- I mean...

1:22:02.071 --> 1:22:06.868
He was a dead weight. He was
holding us back and he knew it.

1:22:07.869 --> 1:22:10.163
You gave him a chance to live.

1:22:10.830 --> 1:22:13.124
Maybe he did the same for you.

1:22:16.169 --> 1:22:20.339
I wish I could remember him
like that and believe it.

1:22:20.757 --> 1:22:22.175
I do.

1:22:27.013 --> 1:22:28.431
Go on to sleep.

1:22:31.017 --> 1:22:33.311
A cross isn't a bad thing to see.

1:22:33.686 --> 1:22:37.648
It can be beautiful
and everybody has one.

1:22:39.150 --> 1:22:40.818
That was his.

1:22:43.905 --> 1:22:45.364
Go on to sleep.

1:24:30.261 --> 1:24:32.930
- Are we near that trail?
- It's a little way.

1:24:33.056 --> 1:24:35.558
It's narrow,
they might not follow us.

1:24:38.895 --> 1:24:40.563
Ride for it.

1:27:41.536 --> 1:27:43.621
This looks like the place to stay.

1:27:43.996 --> 1:27:46.874
When they want to try that trail
they're welcome.

1:27:47.083 --> 1:27:48.960
Couldn't they come around the hill?

1:27:50.962 --> 1:27:54.298
It'll take them a long time.
Too long for them.

1:27:56.134 --> 1:27:58.010
This is the chance I thought we had.

1:27:59.011 --> 1:28:02.974
- You mean, if we stay here?
- Or one of us.

1:28:05.268 --> 1:28:06.936
What does that mean?

1:28:08.062 --> 1:28:10.982
You take her and get out of here.
I'll stay here for awhile.

1:28:11.315 --> 1:28:14.736
- How long?
- I can hold it pretty long.

1:28:14.861 --> 1:28:18.614
- I couldn't?
- You're a cardsharp.

1:28:18.698 --> 1:28:21.409
With a rifle you can't hit
a broadside of that mountain.

1:28:21.868 --> 1:28:24.495
- You want to bet something?
- I haven't got anything.

1:28:24.537 --> 1:28:28.916
Neither have I. How about our lives?
They're not worth much.

1:28:30.126 --> 1:28:31.794
Just do what I told you.

1:28:33.046 --> 1:28:36.174
Hooker, you told everybody else,
but don't tell me.

1:28:36.340 --> 1:28:37.675
Don't tell me what to do.

1:28:37.884 --> 1:28:39.969
- No one of you are going to do this.
- Why not?

1:28:40.053 --> 1:28:42.430
- Not for me.
- Who said anything about you?

1:28:42.430 --> 1:28:44.390
This is between us.
This is a bet we're making.

1:28:44.515 --> 1:28:46.392
Don't listen to him.

1:28:46.559 --> 1:28:50.938
He's tried to make me bet something
for a long time. I accept.

1:28:51.689 --> 1:28:52.857
All right.

1:29:06.579 --> 1:29:09.082
- High card stays?
- That's good enough.

1:29:15.338 --> 1:29:17.006
You never trust me.

1:29:17.840 --> 1:29:21.761
I was always told, cut the deck.
You can't win but you'll last longer.

1:29:21.844 --> 1:29:23.304
Are you both crazy?

1:29:23.388 --> 1:29:26.307
- Have you gone crazy too?
- You stay out of this.

1:29:26.474 --> 1:29:29.394
For once something has got
nothing to do with you.

1:29:29.435 --> 1:29:31.312
Cut.

1:29:31.646 --> 1:29:33.523
Age before beauty.

1:29:45.910 --> 1:29:47.578
You lose.

1:29:49.580 --> 1:29:50.915
Now get out.

1:29:52.375 --> 1:29:54.669
You bet something
and you won, so take it.

1:29:54.711 --> 1:29:56.295
Take it and get out.

1:29:58.005 --> 1:29:59.799
And take her with you.

1:30:18.025 --> 1:30:20.528
This is the only thing
I was ever lucky at:

1:30:22.238 --> 1:30:23.740
...cards.

1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:52.101
See you later.

1:30:52.435 --> 1:30:55.563
Sure, see you there.

1:33:08.196 --> 1:33:09.864
You're in the clear now.

1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:17.288
The old priest called it,
"The Garden of Evil".

1:33:24.087 --> 1:33:27.840
Fiske. He cheated me back there.

1:33:27.965 --> 1:33:30.468
I don't know how,
but I know why.

1:33:31.552 --> 1:33:35.098
- Why?
- You.

1:33:35.932 --> 1:33:38.643
- You'd have stayed if you'd won.
- Yes.

1:33:39.644 --> 1:33:43.398
- Why?
- Somebody always stays.

1:33:44.065 --> 1:33:47.193
All over the world,
somebody gets it done.

1:33:52.198 --> 1:33:56.786
He cheated me. He's better than
I thought he was, in every way.

1:33:57.578 --> 1:34:01.541
I've got to go back and tell him.
I've got to go back now.

1:34:02.291 --> 1:34:05.628
- You knew that?
- Yes.

1:34:07.755 --> 1:34:09.424
I'll see you sometime.

1:36:33.276 --> 1:36:34.527
No, don't.

1:36:37.071 --> 1:36:38.531
Don't move me.

1:36:43.870 --> 1:36:45.413
You...

1:36:46.372 --> 1:36:47.874
...you said I...

1:36:48.207 --> 1:36:50.835
...couldn't hit the side
of a mountain.

1:36:55.548 --> 1:36:59.552
- Look at that.
- You did real good.

1:37:00.803 --> 1:37:04.307
One thing I had against you,

1:37:05.099 --> 1:37:06.976
...you knew so much.

1:37:08.311 --> 1:37:11.230
You always knew everything.

1:37:12.148 --> 1:37:13.441
Not quite.

1:37:14.567 --> 1:37:17.487
You were right about her.

1:37:18.738 --> 1:37:20.907
But not about you.

1:37:22.075 --> 1:37:23.326
You cheated me.

1:37:25.036 --> 1:37:29.207
- You come back to tell me?
- That's right.

1:37:41.719 --> 1:37:43.596
There it goes, Hooker.

1:37:46.557 --> 1:37:49.060
Everyday it goes...

1:37:51.104 --> 1:37:54.440
...and somebody always goes with it.

1:37:57.944 --> 1:37:59.779
Today it's me.

1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:13.668
Yeah, I cheated you.
You want to forget it?

1:38:16.129 --> 1:38:17.380
No.

1:38:19.757 --> 1:38:23.720
Go home, Hooker.
Go home.

1:38:25.388 --> 1:38:27.682
Build one somewhere.

1:38:28.725 --> 1:38:32.687
Get a hammer and nails.

1:38:34.397 --> 1:38:37.150
You know how,
you know everything.

1:38:38.484 --> 1:38:43.489
Take...

1:38:44.991 --> 1:38:47.493
Take her home.

1:39:18.357 --> 1:39:20.443
The Garden of Evil.

1:39:25.531 --> 1:39:27.784
If the earth was made of gold,

1:39:28.618 --> 1:39:32.789
I guess men would die
for a handful of dirt.
