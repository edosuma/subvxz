01:59.725 --> 02:00.838
Come on baby.

02:16.357 --> 02:17.478
We need some music.

02:19.376 --> 02:20.268
Peyton!

02:23.253 --> 02:24.145
Sorry...

02:25.122 --> 02:26.237
Where the hell are we?

02:26.949 --> 02:28.736
Miles from normal.

02:32.480 --> 02:34.123
What is she doing here?

02:35.535 --> 02:36.873
You invited her!

02:42.043 --> 02:42.955
Ow!

02:54.398 --> 02:55.443
- Bail!
- Bail!

03:04.987 --> 03:06.246
Nice. What's next?

03:06.338 --> 03:08.643
- Uh, you pick.
- Alright.

03:26.135 --> 03:28.472
Could this night get any freakier?

03:29.384 --> 03:31.073
Nathan with Lucas.

03:31.626 --> 03:32.921
Haley and Peyton?

03:33.357 --> 03:34.836
What the hell is going on?

03:51.129 --> 03:51.824
Hey stranger.

03:52.650 --> 03:53.612
No stranger than you.

03:54.339 --> 03:58.374
- Did you get my message last night?
- Nah. I was at the library late. Midterms.

03:58.686 --> 04:00.478
- Yours or Nathan's?
- Both, actually.

04:00.878 --> 04:03.160
- Well. Good luck with that.
- Luke.

04:03.857 --> 04:08.389
You're cool with this, right? I mean, last week, when you said you didn't trust me...

04:08.470 --> 04:13.120
I know. I didn't mean that. Alright? I meant I don't trust Nathan.

04:14.333 --> 04:15.464
Hey, you got a second?

04:16.446 --> 04:17.738
Speaking of...

04:20.882 --> 04:22.894
So last week... sucked.

04:23.395 --> 04:25.305
I just... wanted to say thanks.

04:25.919 --> 04:28.521
- Oh, you made me a mix?
- Just trying to square my karma.

04:28.791 --> 04:31.419
Uh-huh. Does this mean we're dating?

04:32.136 --> 04:34.937
Listen, you've got a long bus ride tonight and I had some free time.

04:35.377 --> 04:36.709
Don't read too much into it.

04:40.630 --> 04:41.326
Haley!

04:42.432 --> 04:43.492
- Hey!
- Hey.

04:43.876 --> 04:47.081
- Coming to the game tonight?
- Um... I don't know.

04:47.484 --> 04:50.317
You should come. We always beat the crap out of the Pickerington Hicks.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.683
- They're called the Hicks?
- Well no. But they should be.

04:52.738 --> 04:54.367
The place is all pickup trucks and mulch.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.293
It's definitely worth the road trip.

05:00.107 --> 05:01.146
I'll look for you.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.225
Okay.

05:09.282 --> 05:10.925
Dan! We should get going.

05:12.369 --> 05:16.020
What is wrong with these people? Putting an SPL dinner on a game night?

05:16.163 --> 05:21.033
Honey, it's once a year. We'll go, we'll enjoy a nice, adult evening downtown.

05:21.206 --> 05:23.213
And tomorrow you can pour over the box scores.

05:23.243 --> 05:26.095
I still don't understand why we booked a room. It's only a thirty minute drive.

05:26.280 --> 05:31.472
Because you and your wife are in need of some good, old fashioned alone time.

05:32.911 --> 05:34.251
I like the sound of that.

05:35.247 --> 05:37.897
Well Nathan's got his cell. I can keep tabs on the game from dinner.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.342
Dan, why don't we spend 48 hours without basketball and see where we wind up?

05:42.921 --> 05:44.702
- Okay?
- Sure.

05:44.860 --> 05:45.644
Thank you.

05:49.821 --> 05:50.539
Okay.

05:52.403 --> 05:54.159
What does this dress say to you?

05:54.421 --> 05:56.984
Uh... beware of crazy ladies who talk to dresses.

05:57.276 --> 05:59.766
No, come on. Really. I need your help.

06:00.502 --> 06:03.663
Single and successful or married to her work?

06:04.395 --> 06:07.430
- Is this for that justice league thing?
- Small business league.

06:07.502 --> 06:11.439
And yes. It's one of the few times a year I get to dress up and I'd like to look nice.

06:11.512 --> 06:12.852
Well, is Keith still going as your date?

06:13.323 --> 06:15.095
He's not a date. We're just going together.

06:15.443 --> 06:16.467
Why would you say that?

06:16.759 --> 06:19.273
You guys hang out a lot. You get along well...

06:19.329 --> 06:21.516
Yeah, well I get along with the guy who delivers our water.

06:21.556 --> 06:22.698
That doesn't mean I'm gonna date him.

06:22.770 --> 06:25.003
Yeah, but the guy who delivers our water is not Keith.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.872
Where is this coming from?

06:27.209 --> 06:31.515
Well, you know I've been thinking, you know, that you're not exactly old, Mom.

06:31.916 --> 06:33.896
Thanks... I think.

06:34.111 --> 06:37.429
I'm just saying that I'd be all right with it, you know...

06:37.951 --> 06:39.051
if that's what you're worried about.

06:39.385 --> 06:43.686
Well, thank you, Cupid. Now, help with the dresses, please.

06:44.135 --> 06:47.192
- Black, I guess.
- Hmm. Black it is.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.605
Keith didn't say something to you, did he?

06:52.938 --> 06:56.455
Oh, you mean about the date that you two aren't going on tonight?

06:57.095 --> 06:58.273
Not a word...

06:59.660 --> 07:01.145
Good luck with your game.

07:01.467 --> 07:02.567
Yeah, you too, Mom.

07:14.737 --> 07:16.295
Safe yet?

07:18.487 --> 07:21.042
No hostile tone, no bitter complaints,

07:21.410 --> 07:24.840
no yelling at your best friend because you broke up with your jerk of a boyfriend?

07:25.752 --> 07:27.369
Oh my god, a smile!

07:28.230 --> 07:31.819
Alright. I was a mess last week. I'm sorry.

07:34.168 --> 07:38.634
Apology accepted! A-P-O. L-O-G. Y?

07:38.849 --> 07:42.909
Because I love you. Get your skinny ass up and lets go beat the pirates.

07:44.287 --> 07:46.887
- What are you doing?
- What? It's a web cam. It's what they're for.

07:47.030 --> 07:47.717
Come on.

07:48.551 --> 07:49.514
Overweight.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.673
- Now we're even.
- You're dead!

07:52.894 --> 07:53.737
Dead!

08:01.382 --> 08:03.093
Alright! Knock it off.

08:06.917 --> 08:08.853
This is our first away game.

08:09.472 --> 08:11.720
For those of you who are unfamiliar,

08:12.257 --> 08:16.072
you sit there with your mouths shut and focus.

08:17.449 --> 08:19.748
I'll choose the music.

08:20.776 --> 08:23.824
Tonight's theme is defense.

08:29.983 --> 08:30.967
Lets roll!

08:47.131 --> 08:49.991
Good evening, ladies and gentleman, from the stinks of Pickerington

08:50.038 --> 08:52.915
where the pirates always suck and the livestock is nervous,

08:53.278 --> 08:57.078
I'm Mouth McFadden and sitting in with me at tonight's away game is Haley James.

08:57.176 --> 08:59.019
Haley, how do you see tonight's match up?

08:59.271 --> 09:02.604
I'd rather not be associated with your lunacy, Mouth.

09:03.294 --> 09:07.206
Oh, see, Lucas looks even hotter in blue. You should totally hook up with him.

09:07.302 --> 09:08.445
- Stop it.
- What?

09:08.583 --> 09:11.912
At the very least you're due for a little rebound action unless you're still into Nathan.

09:12.020 --> 09:12.740
I'm not.

09:13.535 --> 09:17.938
Alright. Since you're my pal you can have a courtesy hold on Lucas for the weekend,

09:18.121 --> 09:21.850
- but after that he's fair game.
- He's already fair game, thanks.

09:21.951 --> 09:23.958
So what's the story with that one anyway?

09:24.773 --> 09:27.231
She's tutoring Nathan... supposedly.

09:27.486 --> 09:28.935
And hanging out with Lucas.

09:29.365 --> 09:32.658
Right... we're supposed to believe she's just friends with both of them?

09:35.236 --> 09:36.604
Did you see that?

09:37.155 --> 09:39.334
- What?
- Nathan just gave her the nod.

09:39.774 --> 09:43.333
- What nod?
- The “lets hook up after the game” nod.

09:44.070 --> 09:47.271
Wanna know what I think? I think Nathan likes tutor girl.

09:47.322 --> 09:50.670
But I think tutor girl likes Lucas. And I know I like Lucas.

09:50.727 --> 09:52.656
And I don't know who the hell you like anymore.

09:53.414 --> 09:55.549
This is all turning into one big love...

09:58.027 --> 10:00.690
rectangle plus one, whatever that is.

10:02.738 --> 10:06.005
So as you've heard Ravens have the big lead early in the second quarter.

10:08.523 --> 10:10.449
Ooh. And that's a foul by Nathan Scott.

10:11.371 --> 10:13.957
Hey. Why don't you try putting your hands up on defense, alright?

10:14.049 --> 10:16.558
- Why don't you try not getting beat?
- Why don't I just beat your ass?

10:17.060 --> 10:17.817
Moron...

10:20.535 --> 10:21.939
Keep it up, punk.

10:23.157 --> 10:23.931
Ball in!

10:27.504 --> 10:30.063
Hey, you gonna talk or you gonna play, Daddy's boy?

10:30.331 --> 10:33.854
Hey, Haley's looking pretty fine tonight, right? Can't wait to get with that.

10:40.031 --> 10:42.271
Hey. So I saw Nathan in the shower...

10:42.780 --> 10:44.467
yeah, no wonder you broke up with him.

11:03.698 --> 11:06.056
You two! You're out of here!

11:06.417 --> 11:08.648
You're throwing them both out of the game?

11:08.700 --> 11:10.641
I got to, Coach. I got things rolling.

11:11.618 --> 11:13.697
They're on the same team!

11:15.311 --> 11:17.221
Ow! Pain!

11:26.180 --> 11:30.538
Nathan Scott! Lucas Scott! On your feet!

11:33.988 --> 11:35.909
Congratulations, boys.

11:36.174 --> 11:40.152
In all my years of coaching, this has got to be a low point.

11:40.748 --> 11:46.211
That little stunt you pulled almost cost us our undefeated record.

11:47.598 --> 11:53.296
I don't give diddlee-squat about your issues with your daddy or your girlfriends.

11:53.368 --> 11:56.829
As far as I'm concerned, you can hate each other until hell freezes over.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.783
But if you're going to play on my team,

12:00.336 --> 12:02.972
you're gonna learn how to work together.

12:04.847 --> 12:06.312
I can't see that happening, Whitey?

12:06.388 --> 12:11.544
Yeah? Well you've got thirty-some-odd miles to figure it out.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.951
They can't just leave us here.

12:20.586 --> 12:21.687
Nice work, idiot.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.018
This is great. This is friggin' great.

12:28.752 --> 12:30.654
- Calm down.
- You calm down, man.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.206
My phone's on that bus. My wallet's on that bus.

12:33.276 --> 12:34.271
Yeah, my wallet too!

12:34.896 --> 12:36.491
So what the hell do we do now?

12:37.491 --> 12:38.668
We start walking.

12:53.362 --> 12:55.043
Ow, that's too tight.

12:55.677 --> 12:57.454
- There. How's that?
- Too loose.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.280
Ow, that's too tight.

13:03.246 --> 13:04.869
So you're in college, right?

13:05.626 --> 13:06.439
Junior.

13:06.896 --> 13:09.200
Oh... you know, I love college guys.

13:10.551 --> 13:12.415
Two more years, you'll be a doctor.

13:13.076 --> 13:15.221
Uh, not exactly.

13:16.065 --> 13:17.903
So tell me, Doctor College Boy.

13:18.072 --> 13:21.498
If you wanted to give me something for the pain, you could, right?

13:21.877 --> 13:23.771
Well, the team doctor would have to...

13:30.244 --> 13:32.362
I could maybe do that.

13:37.564 --> 13:39.879
Wait. You're not a cop, are you?

13:40.846 --> 13:41.594
No.

13:46.585 --> 13:48.188
Well, and one for tomorrow...

13:48.762 --> 13:49.622
please.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.833
Okay, here's the thing. Those are really strong painkillers.

13:55.869 --> 13:59.809
So just take, like, a half of one. Every twelve hours.

14:02.392 --> 14:03.655
Oops! All gone!

14:08.157 --> 14:10.230
We wouldn't be out here if you never joined the team.

14:10.431 --> 14:13.446
No. We wouldn't be out here if you weren't such a jackass about me joining the team.

14:13.886 --> 14:16.396
Why do you want my life so bad anyway, man?

14:16.478 --> 14:19.555
Dude, don't flatter yourself, alright? You're about the last person I want to trade places with.

14:19.621 --> 14:23.589
Oh yeah? Well all I know is you came out nowhere and started grabbing everything you could from me.

14:23.625 --> 14:25.837
- My game, my girl...
- What about you, huh?

14:26.190 --> 14:29.769
I bet your grades sucked before you met me. But I didn't see you going to Haley for help then.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.333
Who said what me and Haley's got's is about grades.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.001
Ravens! Hey Ravens!

14:37.542 --> 14:38.354
Want a ride?

14:40.157 --> 14:41.888
I wouldn't take that ride if I was you.

14:42.773 --> 14:43.730
You're not me.

14:44.453 --> 14:45.502
You never will be.

14:56.485 --> 14:58.620
Two little Ravens for the price of one.

14:58.876 --> 15:01.200
Get in or the superstar dies.

15:19.306 --> 15:20.708
What are you still doing here?

15:20.893 --> 15:22.253
I'm thinking of transferring.

15:23.458 --> 15:24.439
What's your excuse?

15:24.732 --> 15:26.623
Brooke. She's been in there forever.

15:28.240 --> 15:29.254
Peyton!

15:30.697 --> 15:31.921
Oh boy.

15:33.181 --> 15:33.975
Hi.

15:34.553 --> 15:37.159
This is my best friend in the whole wide world. Don't you think she's pretty?

15:37.210 --> 15:37.952
What is this?

15:38.290 --> 15:40.974
She found some pills... on the floor.

15:41.225 --> 15:43.742
She'll be fine. Just uh, let her sleep it off.

15:45.954 --> 15:47.768
Hey! Ooh, call me!

15:52.697 --> 15:56.159
We should totally hang out more. What is your name?

15:56.568 --> 15:57.567
Haley...

15:58.822 --> 16:03.194
Yeah. I don't like that name. Lets call you... Brooke!

16:03.742 --> 16:04.704
Hi friend!

16:07.357 --> 16:08.348
Thanks.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.435
Sure. I'll see you guys later.

16:10.987 --> 16:13.757
- Where's your ride?
- Oh. I'm going to take the last fan bus back.

16:14.300 --> 16:15.435
It just left.

16:15.549 --> 16:18.083
That's perfect. Brookie can come with us!

16:18.663 --> 16:20.357
Yeah, she named me Brooke.

16:20.694 --> 16:25.452
Peyton, can she come? Please? Peyton, please!

16:25.543 --> 16:28.800
Just don't touch the stereo. Or we'll have a problem.

16:30.581 --> 16:31.697
Road trip.

16:32.747 --> 16:36.822
We're going on a road trip. We're going on a road trip.

16:47.119 --> 16:49.648
Alright. This is my stop. Thanks for the ride, fellas.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.951
This one's funny, Thing. Lets kill him last.

16:54.743 --> 16:56.464
Wait. Your name is Thing?

16:56.643 --> 16:58.466
That's right. Thing.

16:58.589 --> 17:00.048
And I'm Thing One.

17:00.380 --> 17:01.686
Okay, wait. Let me guess.

17:02.705 --> 17:03.769
Thing Two.

17:04.226 --> 17:06.401
Thing Three. Because I'm the third.

17:09.519 --> 17:11.214
Whoa. Dude...

17:11.388 --> 17:14.244
Get your clothes off, boys. You're going shopping.

17:24.704 --> 17:27.281
Oh, what do you know? We finally got the center aisle this year.

17:28.393 --> 17:30.394
Guy must've thought I said Dan Scott.

17:30.548 --> 17:34.675
No. Dan's table has one spot for Dan and five for his ego.

17:37.368 --> 17:40.895
Well, well, well. Isn't this cozy?

17:41.776 --> 17:42.616
Hey Karen.

17:43.070 --> 17:43.952
Hi.

17:45.058 --> 17:46.040
Hi Deb...

17:46.896 --> 17:47.879
Dan.

18:02.379 --> 18:05.389
- Hemorrhoid ointment.
- Dude, this is total crap.

18:05.681 --> 18:09.095
These guys are morons, not killers. I bet it's not even a real gun.

18:09.398 --> 18:12.378
Lets just play the game, get our clothes, and get home.

18:13.694 --> 18:18.103
Okay. Ah, we need two bottles of spring feminine cleansers.

18:21.230 --> 18:23.352
Oh, great. A pair of douche bags.

18:24.386 --> 18:25.799
A case of beer and we're out of here.

18:26.111 --> 18:28.225
What? How are we going to pull that off?

18:28.508 --> 18:29.587
Would you card us?

18:31.471 --> 18:32.402
I didn't think so.

18:38.854 --> 18:40.886
Brooke! Come on...

18:49.012 --> 18:53.907
Don't you two like the same guys? Or guy, or something?

18:54.558 --> 18:56.569
I'm just tutoring him, that's all.

18:58.694 --> 19:02.104
So you're not into him? Because he seems to be into you.

19:02.196 --> 19:03.497
He gave her the nod!

19:04.683 --> 19:06.303
Just be careful.

19:08.873 --> 19:12.574
- Well, what about you and Lucas?
- What about us?

19:12.810 --> 19:17.347
Oh, come on. Tortured artist meets tortured athlete? Talk about your obvious attraction.

19:21.418 --> 19:23.772
- I hear birds.
- Unbelievable!

19:23.844 --> 19:26.328
Brooke, did you not think to put gas in the car?

19:29.916 --> 19:31.545
Answer the question, Brooke.

19:33.434 --> 19:34.607
Why are we stopping?

19:43.383 --> 19:45.513
- Sweet. They scored the brew.
- Where's the porn?

19:45.686 --> 19:48.584
Hey. You had your fun. Now give us back our clothes.

19:48.860 --> 19:52.031
Yeah, man, I'm done with these clowns. Hey, lets go somewhere and get wasted.

19:52.113 --> 19:54.605
- With no porno mags?
- They didn't have Playgirl.

19:54.780 --> 19:58.159
- Go back inside and get some hardcore.
- Wait! Shut up! Listen!

20:00.821 --> 20:02.429
- Come on, roll, roll, roll.
- Go, roll!

20:03.545 --> 20:05.092
Come on, lets go, lets go, lets go.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.359
Move it! Come on! Lets go!

20:21.215 --> 20:25.187
- Oh, yeah. Yeah, baby!
- Yeah, yeah, right. Alright. Yahoo!

20:25.249 --> 20:27.154
Yeah, enough's enough. Give us our clothes.

20:27.650 --> 20:29.692
Don't they say please in the suburbs?

20:30.175 --> 20:32.376
He said give us our clothes, you hick.

20:34.291 --> 20:37.286
- Can't you steal a fake gun in the suburbs?
- That's great. It's a starter pistol.

20:37.977 --> 20:40.712
- I knew this thing was fake.
- Yeah, but our fists are real.

20:41.244 --> 20:45.617
Look. We'll give you guys your clothes back. We'll even give one of you a ride home.

20:45.750 --> 20:48.130
Yeah. What do you mean by one of us?

20:50.725 --> 20:52.390
The game is Gladiator.

20:52.626 --> 20:55.841
Basically, you guys beat the hell out of each other for our amusement.

20:56.353 --> 20:59.317
The one left standing gets his clothes and a ride to a phone.

20:59.763 --> 21:02.692
The loser... well he loses.

21:02.954 --> 21:04.315
Let the games begin.

21:11.057 --> 21:15.989
Okay, the game isn't called two punks staring at each other.

21:16.116 --> 21:18.912
It's called Gladiator. Get to it.

21:19.450 --> 21:23.621
Alright, you can screw yourself. Because there's no way in hell that the two of us are going to fight.

21:26.491 --> 21:27.473
Or maybe we are.

21:36.000 --> 21:40.628
This is great. Not only do I get to kick your ass but you get 30 miles to think about it.

21:46.571 --> 21:48.547
What the hell are you doing, man? We should be fighting them.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.283
- You want it?
- Yeah.

21:54.789 --> 21:55.910
Wait, wait, wait!

21:58.697 --> 21:59.535
You okay?

22:00.463 --> 22:01.240
Yeah.

22:02.064 --> 22:03.549
Pickerington morons.

22:03.779 --> 22:05.377
- Give us the keys.
- Give us our clothes.

22:07.968 --> 22:08.755
Fine.

22:11.280 --> 22:14.002
You guys wanna play games, huh? I've got a little game for you.

22:14.219 --> 22:18.888
It's called keys for clothes. You give us a piece of our clothes, we'll give you a key.

22:19.007 --> 22:21.059
- No deal.
- Fine. We were walking anyways.

22:21.268 --> 22:23.057
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
- We'll deal.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.235
- Forget it. I want to walk home.
- It's dark.

22:26.329 --> 22:27.327
Man, seriously.

22:28.039 --> 22:30.271
Fine. Give him his sweats.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.724
- That's worth a house key.
- Hey, keep them coming.

22:40.730 --> 22:43.844
There's still no signal. Who lives like this?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.160
Pop the trunk, will you?

22:46.046 --> 22:48.231
Peyton, don't listen to it. It might be a trick.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.224
Yeah, it's empty.

22:50.890 --> 22:55.021
I saw a gas station a few miles back. If I'm not back in an hour, tell my mom I loved her?

22:55.759 --> 22:58.538
- Don't you mean Nathan?
- I'll go with you.

22:59.685 --> 23:00.612
What about me?

23:02.664 --> 23:04.856
I could suffocate in here.

23:05.573 --> 23:07.308
- Guys!
- You did crack a window, right?

23:09.219 --> 23:15.353
Come on! I'm scared! Please! Come on, you guys.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.493
Don't go! Someone will come!

23:19.752 --> 23:23.688
Scott Motor Company's been reaching a lead in new car sales for the past six years.

23:23.873 --> 23:26.233
Pretty soon we'll be the top dealership in North Carolina.

23:27.236 --> 23:28.711
So you two are in business together?

23:28.859 --> 23:33.483
Uh, no. I own the company. Keith runs a garage.

23:33.585 --> 23:35.014
I fix the junk that he sells.

23:36.140 --> 23:38.275
Alright. Lets give credit where credit's due.

23:39.699 --> 23:44.060
Big brother here has been tinking with cars for years. If it wasn't for his influence and...

23:44.952 --> 23:48.507
lack of initiative, I may never have been able to realize my dream.

23:48.926 --> 23:52.361
Hmm. Was it really my influence, Dan?

23:52.995 --> 23:56.609
Because I thought it was Deb's money that bankrolled your dream.

23:57.799 --> 24:01.137
True. Deb's father took a leap of faith with me.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.296
Of course, I returned his investment ten-fold.

24:04.434 --> 24:07.854
And every good business man knows it's a long road from seed money...

24:08.259 --> 24:10.515
- To profit.
- To profits, exactly.

24:10.593 --> 24:11.521
Amen to that.

24:12.678 --> 24:17.320
So Keith. You talk about being a self-made man but... self-made into what?

24:18.278 --> 24:19.134
Excuse me.

24:29.712 --> 24:32.763
Last key. You got one thing left.

24:32.902 --> 24:35.087
Give us the car key and we'll give you the shirt.

24:35.379 --> 24:36.582
I can live without my shirt.

24:37.466 --> 24:40.510
- Oh man, no!
- Have fun walking.

24:42.557 --> 24:45.895
Just find the key... we're gonna kill those guys.

24:49.899 --> 24:51.154
What did you mean before?

24:51.983 --> 24:54.472
About Nathan when you said be careful?

24:55.077 --> 24:57.416
I just know him, that's all.

24:57.965 --> 24:59.310
Said the ex-girlfriend.

25:00.638 --> 25:03.285
Look, we were crazy with drama but I'm over it.

25:04.917 --> 25:08.752
He's not a complete waste. He just- he's really threatened by Lucas.

25:09.381 --> 25:12.097
It could all just be a big mind game. That's how he works.

25:13.130 --> 25:14.292
Do you like him?

25:14.927 --> 25:17.993
I was- talk about stuff, you know what I mean?

25:18.317 --> 25:21.456
- Like what?
- Like school or... his dad.

25:21.512 --> 25:25.638
Oh. Dan. Danny sure did a number on his boy, right?

25:26.273 --> 25:27.557
Yeah. Both of them.

25:29.519 --> 25:31.322
So you didn't answer my question.

25:32.145 --> 25:33.134
Do you like him?

25:34.332 --> 25:39.349
It doesn't matter. I mean, that... it would be too weird around Lucas.

25:40.178 --> 25:43.777
That's his problem. You've got a life to live too.

25:43.865 --> 25:45.283
It just seems kind of selfish.

25:45.795 --> 25:48.811
Why? Did he ask you if he could go out with me?

25:50.802 --> 25:52.160
Did he ask you out?

25:53.036 --> 25:53.792
No.

25:54.581 --> 25:58.103
That's not the point. No. He wouldn't ask permission. So why should you?

25:59.450 --> 26:01.207
Would you say yes if he asked you out?

26:03.454 --> 26:04.622
It depends.

26:05.078 --> 26:08.513
What song is playing... am I in a mood...

26:08.571 --> 26:12.521
is he smiling when he asks or is he doing that goofy brooding thing he does?

26:12.610 --> 26:15.288
Oh, you know I think he's definitely doing the broody thing.

26:15.348 --> 26:16.711
He does that all the time!

26:17.995 --> 26:20.111
It's strange. Just...

26:21.763 --> 26:25.409
the night away from school. It feels like you and I actually live on the same planet.

26:26.596 --> 26:28.486
Life plays trick on you like that.

26:40.123 --> 26:43.324
Can I bankroll another drink for you?

26:43.427 --> 26:44.533
I'm sorry about that.

26:44.973 --> 26:47.990
I shouldn't have dragged you into it.

26:49.458 --> 26:52.044
Sometimes my little brother has a way of getting to me...

26:52.141 --> 26:54.517
- He has a gift.
- Yeah.

26:55.988 --> 27:01.869
You know, you and Karen really go nicely together.

27:04.224 --> 27:06.436
I don't think she sees me that way.

27:06.687 --> 27:08.526
How do you see her?

27:11.346 --> 27:15.105
She's amazing. She's strong, she's beautiful,

27:17.239 --> 27:19.769
and, you know, she's a great mother to Lucas.

27:22.171 --> 27:26.574
- So...
- A relationship would just complicate things.

27:29.138 --> 27:30.373
What about you, Deb?

27:31.442 --> 27:33.507
Tonight was just part of the course with him.

27:35.095 --> 27:37.893
And, I know it's none of my business but why are you...

27:39.256 --> 27:40.770
Why do I stay with him.

27:41.528 --> 27:42.235
Yeah...

27:43.598 --> 27:44.551
It's okay.

27:46.711 --> 27:53.541
Believe it or not, some days he's the man I fell in love with and other days...

27:56.515 --> 27:57.555
I don't know.

27:59.541 --> 28:03.801
Besides, if you've got Lucas to consider, I've certainly got Nathan.

28:05.199 --> 28:07.636
Come on. Lets go rescue Karen.

28:09.910 --> 28:10.734
Yeah.

28:15.570 --> 28:19.551
- Alright, it's a blue key chain.
- Dude, look over here moron. Is that blue?

28:19.683 --> 28:21.047
Are you color blind?

28:21.378 --> 28:26.196
- I can't believe you sucker punched me.
- I had to. It got us outta there, didn't it?

28:33.856 --> 28:34.608
Here.

28:36.576 --> 28:40.860
So what's your master plan, genius? Huh? You gonna hotwire the car?

28:41.823 --> 28:43.251
Actually, we're not gonna have to.

28:44.449 --> 28:48.290
Those idiots are gonna flip out when they find a key chain with no car key.

28:58.304 --> 29:01.560
- Great!
- And no phone. What are we going to do?

29:03.424 --> 29:07.449
So we'll get the car, we'll drive into town, we'll find a phone, and we'll ditch it.

29:08.559 --> 29:10.122
Wait, what if they report it stolen?

29:10.638 --> 29:13.542
Well I kinda think that the cops got the license plate number earlier, don't you?

29:13.608 --> 29:15.242
Yes, but they didn't see who was driving that car.

29:15.318 --> 29:19.189
I mean, think about it, if they pull us over they can pin everything on us.

29:19.292 --> 29:21.513
What if we sit here and we talk about it all night, huh?

29:22.088 --> 29:23.402
Got any better ideas?

29:24.688 --> 29:26.833
- I'll drive.
- No. I'll drive.

29:36.967 --> 29:37.785
Whoa, whoa!

29:39.112 --> 29:40.720
Pickerington sucks!

29:45.362 --> 29:51.656
Oh yeah, oh! They aren't going anywhere. Lets go get them, boys!

29:53.091 --> 29:54.253
- Bail.
- Bail!

29:56.535 --> 29:59.848
- We're gonna pluck you, Ravens!
- Hey, I've still got your shirt!

29:59.898 --> 30:03.436
Shut up! They can run but they can't hide!

30:08.692 --> 30:10.792
- Oh yes!
- So what are you doing?

30:11.319 --> 30:13.832
Um...here, hold this.

30:16.065 --> 30:19.357
- Or you'll stab me?
- A girl can't be too safe.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.382
Here, try and get that gas cap open, will you?

30:22.690 --> 30:25.920
- Does this really work?
- We are about to find out.

30:31.861 --> 30:33.140
Had a lot of practice?

30:34.539 --> 30:36.432
At sucking gas. What did you think I meant?

30:36.483 --> 30:37.336
You wanna do it?

30:38.772 --> 30:40.196
Watch out for the golf ball.

30:43.795 --> 30:45.464
- Oh, yeah.
- Are you kidding?

30:46.426 --> 30:48.951
Dude, who knew you were like the 4th Charlie's Angel?

30:54.207 --> 30:58.414
Oh Ravens! Come out and play

30:59.798 --> 31:00.881
Still out there.

31:01.824 --> 31:03.389
They'll get bored eventually.

31:09.647 --> 31:11.793
So that was a pretty good move with the car keys.

31:13.020 --> 31:17.865
Yeah. It doesn't change the fact that my dad's gonna kill me for getting kicked out of that game.

31:21.630 --> 31:23.845
You should consider yourself lucky sometimes.

31:25.047 --> 31:26.548
Lucking out of a dad?

31:27.695 --> 31:28.837
At least this one.

31:33.364 --> 31:36.082
I remember this one summer, I was playing little league baseball

31:36.562 --> 31:39.078
and I was the pitcher and my dad was the coach.

31:39.763 --> 31:42.257
Anyway, this kid Billy Lyons, he was a great hitter.

31:43.470 --> 31:45.092
Everything he hit was a homerun.

31:45.738 --> 31:50.545
So, you know, he got up to the plate and there was nobody on base so I just walked him.

31:50.740 --> 31:53.264
Four straight pitches, nothing even close to a strike.

31:54.753 --> 31:59.551
So my dad calls a timeout, comes to the mound, and I'm thinking he's gonna say

31:59.599 --> 32:03.075
like, Smart move or Good thinking son, something like that.

32:04.652 --> 32:09.817
But instead... instead he grabs me by the arm,

32:10.473 --> 32:12.766
and he kicks me in the ass as hard as he can.

32:13.801 --> 32:17.241
I mean, he literally took me by the arm so that I wouldn't like, go flying,

32:17.287 --> 32:18.609
he kicked me so hard.

32:20.923 --> 32:23.985
Then he brought Stevie Planking into pitch, sat me on the bench,

32:24.337 --> 32:25.643
never mentioned it again.

32:26.631 --> 32:28.475
- That sucks.
- Yeah.

32:32.326 --> 32:35.668
So just think about that the next time you're feeling sorry for yourself.

32:43.441 --> 32:45.612
I haven't heard from you, Nathan. I'm starting to get nervous.

32:45.827 --> 32:49.251
Uh... just call and leave your stats on my phone as soon as you get this.

32:50.406 --> 32:51.439
You okay?

32:52.391 --> 32:56.461
- Yup. Just a little bit hammered.
- Sorry, Karen. It was my fault.

32:58.022 --> 32:58.863
What?

32:59.856 --> 33:01.964
I thought we said no basketball.

33:02.389 --> 33:05.518
What do you want from me, Deb? You leave me here with Karen and these two?

33:09.886 --> 33:10.992
How you doing, boozy?

33:12.354 --> 33:14.677
Alright, you know what? I'm ready to go.

33:15.307 --> 33:18.078
Oh, there, see. Your ride's leaving.

33:18.743 --> 33:21.780
I mean, she may not be much of a date but at least she's a reliable designated driver.

33:21.922 --> 33:23.362
Dan, that's enough.

33:23.422 --> 33:26.602
You know, maybe you oughtta spend a little less time

33:27.841 --> 33:32.883
worrying about my relationship and a little more time paying attention to your own.

33:35.645 --> 33:38.584
If you call chasing after my leftovers a relationship.

33:40.664 --> 33:45.568
- Keith! Keith! It's not worth it.
- Come on!

33:45.620 --> 33:50.765
Keith! Come on, come on. Please? Lets just go, alright?

33:50.934 --> 33:53.811
Okay, I'm fine.

33:53.904 --> 33:56.237
- It was a joke.
- Come on, please.

34:25.591 --> 34:27.755
Man, it's been like, what? Twenty minutes?

34:28.531 --> 34:29.676
Think they're coming back?

34:32.934 --> 34:33.687
What?

34:34.071 --> 34:36.661
Thing, Thing One, and Thing Three.

34:40.917 --> 34:43.292
Well, yeah man, he was the third.

34:43.521 --> 34:44.292
Yeah.

34:48.734 --> 34:52.487
Hey. What are we doing hiding from these idiots anyway, huh?

34:53.362 --> 34:54.637
Look, I can hold my own.

34:55.478 --> 34:58.283
And I know that you could throw a pretty damn good punch.

35:00.465 --> 35:01.938
I say lets take these fools on.

35:03.024 --> 35:04.826
Alright. I'm in for that.

35:16.285 --> 35:17.800
Are you gonna stay down here all night?

35:19.126 --> 35:19.930
I made a call.

35:22.573 --> 35:25.574
Nathan got thrown out of the game tonight for fighting with Lucas.

35:27.267 --> 35:28.716
Fighting with his brother.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.471
Hmm. I wonder where he gets that from?

35:32.541 --> 35:35.071
His phone's turned off. No one's answering at home.

35:35.266 --> 35:36.238
But he's okay?

35:40.211 --> 35:41.802
I'm sorry about tonight, Deb.

35:42.684 --> 35:47.819
- I don't know how things got so out of hand.
- Things didn't get out of hand, Dan. You did.

35:47.875 --> 35:50.139
- He threw the first punch.
- You provoked him.

35:51.500 --> 35:55.515
Nathan's prospects took a huge blow tonight. Can we just focus on him?

35:58.649 --> 36:00.803
That's the wrong answer, Dan.

36:02.836 --> 36:06.995
And if you don't know that, I'm not sure I know you anymore.

36:08.368 --> 36:10.052
Well that's a two way street.

36:11.608 --> 36:13.472
I'm gonna go upstairs and pack.

36:14.597 --> 36:15.775
We should go home.

36:39.026 --> 36:40.644
He cares about you, you know?

36:43.440 --> 36:44.253
Yeah.

36:48.326 --> 36:49.543
We need some music.

36:51.431 --> 36:52.318
Peyton!

36:55.407 --> 36:56.399
Sorry...

36:57.335 --> 36:58.534
Where the hell are we?

36:59.332 --> 37:01.006
Miles from normal.

37:06.235 --> 37:07.607
What is she doing here?

37:09.055 --> 37:10.463
You invited her!

37:15.640 --> 37:16.879
Ow!

37:21.979 --> 37:24.636
I cannot believe I let him get to me.

37:24.957 --> 37:26.428
So did I.

37:27.375 --> 37:30.396
I guess we both should know better by now.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.373
Yeah, but even so...

37:33.955 --> 37:36.351
you should be able to count on me.

37:37.057 --> 37:42.521
It's like I can see the guy that I am in my head and I can see the guy that I want to be

37:43.467 --> 37:46.775
and they're just... it's not the same.

37:47.103 --> 37:48.541
That's okay, Keith.

37:49.694 --> 37:51.178
I like who you are.

37:53.200 --> 37:57.542
And I do count on you. More than you know.

38:02.371 --> 38:03.553
Can I tell you a secret?

38:04.481 --> 38:05.222
Sure.

38:08.607 --> 38:12.289
Lucas called tonight a date for us.

38:14.838 --> 38:18.540
And for a while, I pretended that it was.

38:20.676 --> 38:21.950
And it felt good.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.318
Can I tell you a secret?

38:27.331 --> 38:29.000
Sure. Go ahead.

38:30.301 --> 38:32.068
I pretended that too.

38:40.045 --> 38:41.192
I love you.

38:43.829 --> 38:44.919
Always have.

39:09.703 --> 39:11.113
Nice. What's next?

39:11.564 --> 39:14.068
- Uh, you pick.
- Alright.

39:17.584 --> 39:21.594
This is so tragic. You two don't actually think you're going to be friends tomorrow, do you?

39:30.698 --> 39:32.096
So this Haley thing...

39:33.751 --> 39:36.381
you know, for some reason she feels like you're not full of crap.

39:36.822 --> 39:39.334
- Don't take advantage of that.
- I'm not going to.

39:39.621 --> 39:43.079
I know you're not. Because if you do, you're going to live to regret it.

39:43.237 --> 39:44.117
Bring it on.

39:47.225 --> 39:48.419
Hey, listen.

39:50.201 --> 39:53.431
Look, man, you didn't have to get in that car when those guys grabbed me.

39:54.024 --> 39:56.359
Especially after you warned me not to.

39:56.831 --> 39:57.664
Right, whatever.

39:58.878 --> 40:02.462
You know the way I see it, I mean, if they would've taken you out,

40:02.504 --> 40:04.214
who the hell else am I gonna have to fight with, right?

40:05.453 --> 40:06.671
Same person I have.

40:16.440 --> 40:17.239
Car.

40:20.762 --> 40:21.946
- You ready?
- Yeah.

40:23.511 --> 40:24.346
Lets do it.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.103
Haley and Peyton.

40:42.927 --> 40:46.158
Oh my Gosh. Nathan with Lucas?

40:58.206 --> 41:00.843
As happens sometimes a moment settled...

41:05.085 --> 41:06.869
and hovered and remained...

41:10.524 --> 41:12.249
for much more than a moment.

41:16.064 --> 41:17.246
And sound stopped...

41:19.110 --> 41:20.360
and movement stopped...

41:22.904 --> 41:24.844
for much, much more than a moment.

41:29.633 --> 41:31.947
And then the moment was gone.
