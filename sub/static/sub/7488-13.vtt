WEBVTT

00:03.556 --> 00:07.350
Don't look now. It's that cute
girl from the bathing suit store.

00:07.351 --> 00:09.201
I just said, "don't look now."

00:09.202 --> 00:13.223
- When can I look?
- When she's not looking.

00:13.224 --> 00:15.358
Now! Wait. No, not now.

00:15.359 --> 00:17.393
Now! Wait. No, not now.

00:17.394 --> 00:19.569
Now! Not now. Now! Not now.

00:19.570 --> 00:21.236
Now! Not now. Now! Not now.

00:21.237 --> 00:22.859
Ow, my neck.

00:22.860 --> 00:25.106
Oh, forget it. It's not her.

00:25.107 --> 00:29.967
It's that long-haired
guy from the surf shop.

00:34.282 --> 00:38.547
Whoa! Bruno Mars is doing a surprise show
at the beach club in 10 minutes! Let's go!

00:38.548 --> 00:40.958
Wait, don't you have
practice with Ally at 4:00?

00:40.959 --> 00:43.541
- Oh, yeah.
- What time is it now?

00:43.542 --> 00:46.175
- 4:30.
- Well, I'm already late.

00:46.176 --> 00:49.492
We'll just work longer next time.
Uh, she won't be mad at me.

00:49.493 --> 00:54.010
- I am so mad at him!
- What's wrong, honey?

00:54.011 --> 00:56.917
Austin was supposed to
be here two hours ago!

00:56.918 --> 01:00.203
And now I have to go to the
emergency Mall Association meeting.

01:00.204 --> 01:02.338
Everyone's freaking out
about all the burglaries.

01:02.339 --> 01:06.807
I know. Last week someone
stole a guitar pick.

01:06.808 --> 01:09.770
I'm just sick about it!

01:09.771 --> 01:13.371
We give those away for free.

01:14.218 --> 01:16.319
Delivery for Lester Dawson.

01:16.320 --> 01:18.900
Oh, me me me!

01:19.556 --> 01:20.793
It's funny.

01:20.794 --> 01:23.510
When the guy at the coffee shop
gives you coffee, he gets a tip.

01:23.511 --> 01:25.528
And how heavy is
a cup of coffee?

01:25.529 --> 01:28.764
Not as heavy as all
these boxes I carry.

01:28.765 --> 01:30.679
You're right, it's not fair.

01:30.680 --> 01:35.180
You should get a job
at the coffee shop.

01:35.689 --> 01:37.079
What'd you get?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.608
Something to help me
catch the mall thief...

01:39.609 --> 01:43.689
A state-of-the-art
security camera.

01:44.732 --> 01:48.151
State-of-the-art
in what century?

01:48.152 --> 01:49.930
I'm gonna go set this up.

01:49.931 --> 01:55.831
Would you please put that new
guitar over in the display case?

02:00.075 --> 02:04.395
Guess who got a job
at The Yarn Barn?

02:04.765 --> 02:09.435
I spent my first day knitting
this scarf instead of working.

02:09.436 --> 02:12.084
That scarf would really
come in handy...

02:12.085 --> 02:14.870
If we didn't live in Miami.

02:19.621 --> 02:21.875
This is the third time
this week he's been late.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.448
Maybe he had an emergency.

02:23.449 --> 02:26.508
Hey guys, we just went
to an awesome concert!

02:26.509 --> 02:29.359
At the emergency room?

02:29.360 --> 02:31.194
No, at the beach!

02:31.195 --> 02:35.875
I think I still have
some sand in my shoe.

02:36.723 --> 02:39.903
That's a lot of sand.

02:42.703 --> 02:45.141
I knew about the Bruno
Mars concert too,

02:45.142 --> 02:49.059
but I didn't go because we made a
commitment to rehearse at 4:00.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.337
You can't set a time
for creativity.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.938
Yeah, you can. It was 4:00.

02:55.569 --> 02:58.651
Well, I'm here now. We
can rehearse all night.

02:58.652 --> 03:00.691
We can't. I have a meeting.

03:00.692 --> 03:03.672
I'm tired of always doing
things on Austin time.

03:03.673 --> 03:06.758
If you won't respect my time,
how can we be partners?

03:06.759 --> 03:09.594
- I'm sorry, Ally.
- I gotta go.

03:09.595 --> 03:11.235
Come on, Trish.

03:11.236 --> 03:13.331
Austin, I'm so disappointed in...
In...

03:13.332 --> 03:15.500
I... I'm leaving.

03:15.501 --> 03:17.569
Hey, Austin. That
was a lot of sand.

03:17.570 --> 03:20.750
I built a sand castle!

03:25.611 --> 03:28.713
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

03:28.714 --> 03:31.848
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

03:31.849 --> 03:33.380
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

03:33.381 --> 03:34.999
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

03:35.000 --> 03:38.044
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

03:38.045 --> 03:41.103
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

03:41.104 --> 03:42.717
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:42.718 --> 03:45.040
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:45.041 --> 03:49.178
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:49.179 --> 03:52.214
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:52.215 --> 03:55.284
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:55.285 --> 03:58.607
<i>With you it's like, "whoa,".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:58.608 --> 04:01.257
<i>I own this dream.</i>

04:01.258 --> 04:04.635
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

04:04.636 --> 04:07.753
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

04:07.754 --> 04:12.014
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

04:17.173 --> 04:19.812
I feel bad about
always being late.

04:19.813 --> 04:21.547
I wanna make it up to Ally.

04:21.548 --> 04:25.988
Give her a gift! I
have just the thing!

04:27.331 --> 04:30.931
An Abe Lincoln ice sculpture.

04:33.303 --> 04:36.423
She does like honesty.

04:37.242 --> 04:40.343
No. I gotta give her
something else.

04:40.344 --> 04:42.384
I've got lots of ice
sculptures in here...

04:42.385 --> 04:46.907
Statue of Liberty, Eiffel
Tower, The Grand Canyon...

04:46.908 --> 04:49.908
Actually, never mind.

04:51.000 --> 04:57.074

04:58.011 --> 05:02.871
The Mall Association
meeting is now in session.

05:04.491 --> 05:08.331
Man oh man, do I love gaveling!

05:09.173 --> 05:14.606
Uh, does anyone have anything new to report
concerning the burglaries of the mall?

05:14.607 --> 05:18.309
Um, yes, Pirate Frank. You
had your hook up first.

05:18.310 --> 05:24.210
Arr... The scallywag stole me harpoon
off the wall of me fish fry.

05:24.488 --> 05:28.624
Uh, y-you're not at work. You don't
have to talk in that weird voice.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.260
What do ye mean?

05:31.261 --> 05:33.095
I have something to say.

05:33.096 --> 05:35.700
I don't want to make
waves or anything.

05:35.701 --> 05:37.252
- But...
- What is it, Bill?

05:37.253 --> 05:41.633
Actually, it's "Billl"
with three "L"s.

05:42.038 --> 05:46.598
Anyway, someone "stol-lle"
my boogie board.

05:46.938 --> 05:49.592
So not cool-ll.

05:49.593 --> 05:51.807
Uh, "cool" only has one "L".

05:51.808 --> 05:55.228
It's al-ll good, Al-lly.

05:56.353 --> 05:58.287
Hey, what are we doing
about my guitar pick?!

05:58.288 --> 06:01.157
I mean, this is an
outrage, people!

06:01.158 --> 06:06.010
Order in the food court!
Order in the food court!

06:06.011 --> 06:08.231
Be quiet!

06:09.697 --> 06:12.368
Man, I love yelling.

06:12.369 --> 06:15.070
As President of the
Mall Association,

06:15.071 --> 06:18.040
I assure you we're doing the
best we can to catch the thief.

06:18.041 --> 06:20.837
Well, your best
isn't good enough!

06:20.838 --> 06:22.758
Dad?!

06:22.970 --> 06:26.150
Sorry, honey. Love you.

06:26.497 --> 06:30.450
Look, we filed the police report,
but what if there was a reward?

06:30.451 --> 06:34.089
Every store in the mall can give free
stuff to whoever helps catch the thief.

06:34.090 --> 06:38.127
Great idea! I'll give a year's
supply of food from me oyster bar.

06:38.128 --> 06:40.951
- Yeah!
- I'll throw in a free surfboard.

06:40.952 --> 06:43.797
- Yeah!
- I can give away free yarn.

06:43.798 --> 06:44.974
Aw.

06:44.975 --> 06:48.188
But I'm sure I'll get fired soon and
work at a store that has better stuff!

06:48.189 --> 06:50.072
Yeah!

06:50.073 --> 06:52.107
Great. Uh, one last thing...

06:52.108 --> 06:55.532
I know this is kind of obvious,
but until the thief is caught,

06:55.533 --> 06:59.918
the police suggested we shouldn't
leave our stores unattended.

06:59.919 --> 07:01.719
Oh.

07:06.932 --> 07:08.972
Thanks.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.164
Ahem...

07:15.265 --> 07:18.955
- Ahem...
- Here's a cough drop.

07:18.956 --> 07:20.996
Thanks.

07:22.627 --> 07:26.367
You don't think I overreacted about
Austin being late to practice, do you?

07:26.368 --> 07:29.890
No. He was totally
disrespectful of your time.

07:29.891 --> 07:32.261
He can't just do things
when he wants to.

07:32.262 --> 07:36.552
Thanks, Trish. Oh, did you pass out those
reward fliers like I asked you to?

07:36.553 --> 07:39.170
No, I didn't want to.

07:39.171 --> 07:40.064
Trish?

07:40.065 --> 07:41.950
Sorry, I was taking a nap.

07:41.951 --> 07:43.477
It's this blanket I made.

07:43.478 --> 07:48.689
It's so soft I just wanna curl up
and sleep every time I touch it.

07:48.690 --> 07:51.986
I guess I'll finish putting up
these reward fliers myself.

07:51.987 --> 07:53.320
You're pretty lucky.

07:53.321 --> 07:57.225
It seems like you're the only store in
the mall who hasn't been robbed yet.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.388
It's not luck, Trish.

07:59.389 --> 08:02.257
I've been watching this
store like a hawk.

08:02.258 --> 08:05.861
There's no way anyone's gonna
rob old "Hawkeye" Dawson.

08:05.862 --> 08:08.682
Someone robbed me.

08:08.874 --> 08:12.542
- What?
- The new guitar is gone!

08:12.543 --> 08:15.404
Way to go, "Hawkeye."

08:15.405 --> 08:17.945
Oh, your dad put up that
new security camera.

08:17.946 --> 08:22.026
- Let's go check the footage.
- Oh!

08:23.201 --> 08:25.347
We'll pull up the footage
from the last 24 hours.

08:25.348 --> 08:27.628
Good idea.

08:30.355 --> 08:33.355
Oh, there's someone!

08:37.918 --> 08:41.097
We can just skip that.

08:44.073 --> 08:47.313
This must be the thief!

08:51.518 --> 08:54.458
- Austin?!
- No way!

09:03.152 --> 09:07.255
- Trish.
- I'm telling you. It's the blanket.

09:07.256 --> 09:11.756
Seriously, it's like
sleeping on a cloud.

09:16.130 --> 09:17.964
Austin's the mall thief!

09:17.965 --> 09:20.033
We have to turn him in.

09:20.034 --> 09:22.035
There must be some explanation.

09:22.036 --> 09:25.262
Austin may be late a lot,
but he doesn't steal.

09:25.263 --> 09:28.877
The crime is on tape!
Well, there's two crimes.

09:28.878 --> 09:30.766
His stealing and your dancing.

09:30.767 --> 09:32.627
Hey.

09:33.023 --> 09:34.491
Wait...

09:34.492 --> 09:35.921
I know why you want
to turn him in.

09:35.922 --> 09:38.017
You just want the rewards
from all the stores.

09:38.018 --> 09:41.504
I am his manager and his friend.

09:41.505 --> 09:45.839
Do you really think I'd sell him out
for a surfboard, and a tanning coupon,

09:45.840 --> 09:48.699
and some sunglasses, and
a free massage chair,

09:48.700 --> 09:51.562
and some jeans, and
a flat screen TV?

09:51.563 --> 09:54.228
He's my friend. He's my friend.

09:54.229 --> 09:58.016
Look, I know Austin, and
there's no way he's a thief.

09:58.017 --> 10:01.330
I'm gonna give him a
chance to explain himself.

10:01.331 --> 10:04.093
A free trip to Hawaii?!

10:04.094 --> 10:06.757
I can always make new friends.
I can always make new friends.

10:06.758 --> 10:10.478
I can always make new friends.

10:16.149 --> 10:19.181
Remember, you can't te
anybody about the guitar.

10:19.182 --> 10:21.318
Your secret's safe with me.

10:21.319 --> 10:25.279
- Austin, it's Ally.
- One second!

10:27.548 --> 10:30.968
- Be cool.
- Got it. Cool.

10:35.339 --> 10:37.664
So what's up?

10:37.665 --> 10:39.765
Nothing.

10:41.046 --> 10:44.046
Just wanted to talk.

10:45.654 --> 10:48.223
Are you still mad
about me being late?

10:48.224 --> 10:50.858
Why? Is there something else I
should be mad at you about?

10:50.859 --> 10:53.869
No, just the late thing.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.327
You got a lot of nice
instruments in here.

10:56.328 --> 10:58.961
Get any new ones lately?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.762
No.

11:01.701 --> 11:04.581
Then what's this?!

11:05.419 --> 11:07.445
That was my made bed.

11:07.446 --> 11:09.620
Now I'm not gonna
get any allowance.

11:09.621 --> 11:11.077
Thanks a lot.

11:11.078 --> 11:13.058
Sorry.

11:13.999 --> 11:16.414
You're sure you don't have
anything you wanna tell me?

11:16.415 --> 11:19.667
Like uh, some big secret?

11:19.668 --> 11:21.623
Uh, uh...

11:21.624 --> 11:24.924
My middle name's Monica.

11:25.016 --> 11:27.369
- What?
- Nothing!

11:27.370 --> 11:31.031
Look, from now on whenever
you need me, I'm available.

11:31.032 --> 11:36.672
- Just not right now. I'm not available.
- Wait. Hold on!

11:43.410 --> 11:45.390
Trish!

11:58.259 --> 12:01.619
Welcome to The Yarn Barn!

12:03.426 --> 12:07.599
I just got back from Austin's
and he totally lied to my face!

12:07.600 --> 12:10.227
I guess he really
is the mall thief.

12:10.228 --> 12:13.727
Then don't you think it's your duty
as President of the Mall Association,

12:13.728 --> 12:15.766
to turn over the security tape?

12:15.767 --> 12:16.967
I guess so.

12:16.968 --> 12:19.590
Good! I'm glad you
agree with me.

12:19.591 --> 12:22.608
I already turned in the tapes.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.512
Why would you do that?!

12:24.513 --> 12:26.746
Two words...

12:26.747 --> 12:28.995
"Re-wards."

12:28.996 --> 12:31.765
Oh. Maybe he can
get out of this.

12:31.766 --> 12:34.677
He won't go to jail unless they
actually catch him with the guitar.

12:34.678 --> 12:38.758
- Hi, Ally.
- You're going to jail.

12:39.283 --> 12:43.083
You have some nerve. Do you have any
idea what you've put us through?

12:43.084 --> 12:45.728
We've had to sit through boring
mall meetings for you...

12:45.729 --> 12:48.489
Collect rewards...

12:49.643 --> 12:54.245
So you're returning the guitar because
you felt bad about stealing it?

12:54.246 --> 12:55.519
I didn't steal it.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.506
I just borrowed it to get it
autographed by Bruno Mars.

12:58.507 --> 13:04.407
I know how much you love him and
I felt bad about being late.

13:06.173 --> 13:09.533
Austin, that's incredible.

13:09.696 --> 13:13.465
I would have given it to you earlier, but
I had to wait to get it autographed.

13:13.466 --> 13:15.067
Thank you.

13:15.068 --> 13:19.136
I wish I knew this before.
The Mall Association...

13:19.137 --> 13:21.526
- Thinks you're the thief.
- What?!

13:21.527 --> 13:23.777
Relax. I'll clear this up.

13:23.778 --> 13:25.820
The employees of this
mall are some of the

13:25.821 --> 13:29.252
most rational and
understanding people I know.

13:29.253 --> 13:30.989
We want Austin!

13:30.990 --> 13:34.022
We want Austin! We want Austin!

13:34.023 --> 13:36.322
You better run.

13:36.323 --> 13:40.103
We want Austin! We want Austin!

13:41.205 --> 13:44.985
We want Austin! We want Austin!

13:50.307 --> 13:52.580
Arr! Where be Austin Moon?

13:52.581 --> 13:56.484
Guys, calm down. I mean,
seriously, pitchforks and torches?

13:56.485 --> 14:00.499
We got them from the
pitchfork and torch store.

14:00.500 --> 14:01.970
We want Austin!

14:01.971 --> 14:03.587
- We want Austin!
- Dez!

14:03.588 --> 14:04.959
We want Austin!

14:04.960 --> 14:09.261
Why are you in the angry mob
that wants to arrest Austin?

14:09.262 --> 14:12.793
I thought this was a happy mob
that wanted to hear Austin sing.

14:12.794 --> 14:15.411
- Where be the mall thief?!
- Yeah!

14:15.412 --> 14:19.707
Look, a-Austin's not the thief.
It was all a misunderstanding.

14:19.708 --> 14:22.476
He borrowed the guitar to get
it autographed for me, see?

14:22.477 --> 14:25.680
You're just covering for him
because he's your Matey!

14:25.681 --> 14:28.649
- Yeah!
- No! No. It's the truth.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.651
Austin's not the thief, I swear!

14:30.652 --> 14:34.031
All he's ever stolen are
the hearts of his fans.

14:34.032 --> 14:37.040
Did you hear her? He
steals people's hearts!

14:37.041 --> 14:38.174
Yeah!

14:38.175 --> 14:41.795
We should, like, totally
stop him before he, like,

14:41.796 --> 14:47.214
robs another store
in the mal-ll!

14:47.703 --> 14:49.604
Yeah!

14:49.605 --> 14:53.385
We want Austin! We want Austin!

14:59.381 --> 15:01.507
What'd I miss?

15:01.508 --> 15:03.282
So how'd it go with the mob?

15:03.283 --> 15:05.553
I told them the truth, but
they didn't believe me.

15:05.554 --> 15:08.356
They still think
you're the mall thief.

15:08.357 --> 15:10.312
Wait a minute, he's
not the thief?

15:10.313 --> 15:12.113
Ah.

15:12.887 --> 15:15.887
I never doubted you.

15:17.468 --> 15:19.314
We need to clear your name.

15:19.315 --> 15:21.702
All we need to do is find
the real thief... And fast.

15:21.703 --> 15:26.234
Oh, but not too fast. I still
have to cash in some rewards.

15:26.235 --> 15:32.135
Come on, I'm not gonna throw away a
coupon for free hair extensions.

15:32.581 --> 15:35.341
Haw-haw-haw-haw!

15:37.257 --> 15:39.777
Give me that!

15:40.433 --> 15:43.524
Uh, can we just get back to
trying to find the thief?

15:43.525 --> 15:45.593
Okay, here's what we know.

15:45.594 --> 15:48.329
So far the thief has
stolen an air conditioner,

15:48.330 --> 15:50.870
a boogie board, a
cowboy hat, some...

15:50.871 --> 15:52.051
I got it!

15:52.052 --> 15:54.803
He's a sweaty cowboy
who loves to surf!

15:54.804 --> 15:56.837
Or he's a sweaty surfer
who likes to ride horses.

15:56.838 --> 16:00.138
Either way he is sweaty.

16:02.377 --> 16:07.025
Wait a minute! The thief is stealing
things in alphabetical order.

16:07.026 --> 16:08.783
He's The Alphabet Bandit!

16:08.784 --> 16:10.985
If anybody asks, I
came up with that.

16:10.986 --> 16:13.075
Woo woo woo...

16:13.076 --> 16:15.623
No one is gonna ask.

16:15.624 --> 16:18.110
Okay, so what was the
last thing he stole?

16:18.111 --> 16:20.135
An octopus from the pet shop.

16:20.136 --> 16:22.446
That means he's up
to the letter "P."

16:22.447 --> 16:24.547
Oh, no!

16:25.312 --> 16:27.601
Oh, thank goodness.

16:27.602 --> 16:31.082
My "P." you're still here.

16:33.062 --> 16:35.043
We need to set a trap.

16:35.044 --> 16:36.716
Oh, I've got it!

16:36.717 --> 16:39.421
Can everyone be back at the
store tomorrow night at 9:00?

16:39.422 --> 16:41.972
- Yeah. Sure.
- I'll be here.

16:41.973 --> 16:45.239
That means 9:00 real time,
not 9:00 Austin time.

16:45.240 --> 16:47.555
Hey, that was the old me.

16:47.556 --> 16:50.276
I promise I'll be here on time.

16:50.277 --> 16:51.600
Okay, here's the plan.

16:51.601 --> 16:54.528
We'll advertise a sale for
everything that starts with "P":

16:54.529 --> 16:56.664
Piccolos, pianos, pan flutes.

16:56.665 --> 16:59.250
The thief won't be able to
resist and we'll catch him.

16:59.251 --> 17:03.511
It'll be the last
"P" he ever takes.

17:05.002 --> 17:07.403
Very mature.

17:09.175 --> 17:12.655
Okay, it is kind of funny.

17:17.865 --> 17:21.036
Where is he? It's 9:30.

17:21.037 --> 17:22.991
I can't believe
Austin is late again.

17:22.992 --> 17:24.770
He promised!

17:24.771 --> 17:26.551
A little help?

17:26.553 --> 17:30.409
Here we are trying to clear his name
and, he doesn't even show up to help?

17:30.410 --> 17:32.366
What is his problem?

17:32.367 --> 17:35.580
I've got a problem... You're
talking and I'm working!

17:35.581 --> 17:38.281
Oh sorry, Trish.

17:42.343 --> 17:45.070
Where did you get this
giant bird cage, Dez?

17:45.071 --> 17:48.451
I used to have a pet ostrich
until it ran away...

17:48.452 --> 17:51.752
At 60.6 miles per hour.

17:52.487 --> 17:53.926
I hope this works.

17:53.927 --> 17:59.291
Oh, it will. The thief's gonna come
in, see the piccolo, trip the wire,

17:59.292 --> 18:01.328
and get trapped in the cage.

18:01.329 --> 18:04.331
Can I get a what-what?

18:04.332 --> 18:06.912
- What?
- What?

18:07.191 --> 18:09.431
I still think this
trap is better.

18:09.432 --> 18:11.438
A giant glue mouse trap?

18:11.439 --> 18:13.541
No, a giant glue people trap.

18:13.542 --> 18:16.855
It's the more humane way
to capture a human.

18:16.856 --> 18:19.436
Is that pizza?

18:19.481 --> 18:21.421
Yeah, it's delicious.

18:21.422 --> 18:23.383
And it starts with
the letter "P."

18:23.384 --> 18:27.883
Nobody would be dumb enough to step on a
glue trap for a plain old slice of pizza.

18:27.884 --> 18:29.885
Oh, you're right.

18:29.886 --> 18:33.072
I better put some
parmesan cheese on it.

18:33.073 --> 18:35.233
Dez, no!

18:35.597 --> 18:37.637
Well...

18:38.600 --> 18:41.702
I was wrong. Someone
is dumb enough.

18:41.703 --> 18:43.521
Oh uh, Trish, throw
him your hair.

18:43.522 --> 18:46.522
We'll pull him out.

18:47.709 --> 18:49.149
All right, ready?

18:49.150 --> 18:50.206
One...

18:50.207 --> 18:51.476
Two...

18:51.477 --> 18:53.457
Three!

19:05.527 --> 19:09.067
That did not go as planned.

19:09.512 --> 19:10.684
Dez, help us!

19:10.685 --> 19:12.851
Dez, come on. We need your help!

19:12.852 --> 19:15.736
Just try your best!
It's the thief!

19:15.737 --> 19:17.605
- My plan is working!
- What?!

19:17.606 --> 19:19.673
Sort of.

19:19.674 --> 19:22.015
Hey, ski mask guy,
can you help us?

19:22.016 --> 19:25.128
Can't. Too busy stealing stuff.

19:25.129 --> 19:29.363
I would take that pizza, but
there's no parmesan on it.

19:29.364 --> 19:32.101
- So I guess I'll just take the piano.
- Not my piano!

19:32.102 --> 19:33.472
No no no no no no no no no.

19:33.473 --> 19:36.296
No no no! I am begging you!

19:36.297 --> 19:38.947
- Mister, please!
- The other way.

19:38.948 --> 19:41.795
Turn around! Okay okay.

19:41.796 --> 19:43.933
We're almost gonna catch you.

19:43.934 --> 19:47.234
Just slow down a little.

19:48.873 --> 19:52.893
Did you get him?
Did you get him?

20:04.969 --> 20:07.309
Ha, gotcha!

20:07.689 --> 20:10.334
Wait, you're the delivery guy.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.340
You're the thief?! Why did
you steal all this stuff?

20:13.341 --> 20:16.276
Because nobody in
the mall tips me.

20:16.277 --> 20:21.077
I should've gotten a job
at the coffee shop.

20:23.840 --> 20:26.620
- Austin?
- I caught the thief.

20:26.621 --> 20:28.422
It's the delivery guy!

20:28.423 --> 20:30.786
How did you get him?
Where were you?

20:30.787 --> 20:32.597
I was hiding in the piano.

20:32.598 --> 20:36.090
I got to the store super early because
I promised you I wouldn't be late.

20:36.091 --> 20:39.381
Wait a minute, you weren't late?

20:39.382 --> 20:41.753
Told you, Trish.

20:41.754 --> 20:45.018
Why didn't you come out
of the piano earlier?

20:45.019 --> 20:48.867
I was setting up a trap using your
blanket to muffle the piano strings,

20:48.868 --> 20:52.754
but the second my face hit this
blanket, I was out like a light.

20:52.755 --> 20:54.823
I know, right?

20:54.824 --> 20:58.603
I'm just glad we caught
The Alphabet Bandit.

20:58.604 --> 21:00.994
Now all we need to do is
get out of this cage,

21:00.995 --> 21:06.320
clear your name with the Mall Association
and get a giant bucket of glue remover.

21:06.321 --> 21:09.501
Glue remover? What for?

21:09.776 --> 21:12.056
Hey, guys.

21:12.500 --> 21:15.260
What did I miss?

21:19.782 --> 21:22.360
Here, Ally, I want you
to have this calendar.

21:22.361 --> 21:26.104
It has all the dates I'm
available to work with you.

21:26.105 --> 21:27.493
But it's blank.

21:27.494 --> 21:31.261
Yeah. You fill in the dates
and whenever you need me...

21:31.262 --> 21:32.956
I'm there.

21:32.957 --> 21:38.800
No more Austin time. From now
on, it's Austin and Ally time.

21:38.801 --> 21:40.349
Thank you, Austin.

21:40.350 --> 21:42.529
Uh, how's today at 4:00?

21:42.530 --> 21:45.361
Sorry, today's no good.

21:45.362 --> 21:47.675
Kidding! I'm kidding!

21:47.676 --> 21:49.844
Since all four of us
helped catch the thief,

21:49.845 --> 21:53.439
Trish is gonna share the rewards with us.
Isn't she nice?

21:53.440 --> 21:55.273
Okay, let's see...

21:55.274 --> 21:59.414
Ally, you take this
really cool pen.

21:59.621 --> 22:02.889
I'll take this flat screen TV.

22:02.890 --> 22:05.755
Dez, you take this candle.

22:05.756 --> 22:08.596
I'll take this laptop.

22:08.597 --> 22:10.948
Austin, you take this key chain.

22:10.949 --> 22:15.629
And I guess I'll take
this trip to Hawaii.

22:17.539 --> 22:19.519
Aloha.

22:23.913 --> 22:26.613
I got a candle!
