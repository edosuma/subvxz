I'm sorry I didn't get
to apologize properly...

09:25.899 --> 09:27.484
[Titus] I'm in such pain!

09:27.567 --> 09:29.152
And then 30 minutes later,

09:29.235 --> 09:30.570
apologize again.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.696
-[Titus wailing]
- Ooh.

09:31.780 --> 09:35.075
Of all the days for Flouncy to break up
with his underage lover.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.034
[mouthing] Really?!

09:37.869 --> 09:39.704
But I'm glad we're friends again.

09:39.788 --> 09:42.290
Next time you're in town, just whistle.

09:42.373 --> 09:45.335
You do know how to whistle,
don't you, Duke?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.712
You just tell the doorman you need a taxi.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.760
[Duke sighs]

09:53.843 --> 09:55.553
[Jacqueline sighs]

09:57.514 --> 09:59.474
Flouncy Magoo?

09:59.557 --> 10:01.226
Titus, I owe you one.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.478
So go ahead and take a dollar
out of my purse.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.230
I got to go lie down.

10:07.000 --> 10:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here

10:17.742 --> 10:19.285
What's going on here, man?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.454
I'm... Flouncy.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.665
You're not really going through
a breakup, are you?

10:23.748 --> 10:25.333
Okay, I can explain.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.085
No. I'm onto you.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.879
You're not gay.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.466
You know what? You explain.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.511
I grabbed the wrong bag, Flouncy.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.556
Chocolates,

10:39.639 --> 10:41.808
edible underwear...

10:41.891 --> 10:44.644
[chuckles] cherry-flavored lube?

10:44.727 --> 10:46.146
That's to dip bread in.

10:46.229 --> 10:48.106
[chuckles] Very funny.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.108
You're trying to bang Jacqueline.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.986
Hey, I get it. It's a classic move.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.905
Pretend you're gay to get close to her,
and then you're all,

10:55.989 --> 10:58.449
"I've never been with a woman.
Maybe you could show me."

10:58.533 --> 11:00.368
In the morning, you write "Psych!"
on her mirror

11:00.451 --> 11:01.703
and never call her again.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.621
We've all done it.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.039
You got me, dude.

11:05.123 --> 11:07.167
[chuckles]

11:07.250 --> 11:09.294
[Titus laughs]

11:09.377 --> 11:11.796
My real name is Cork Rockingham.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.132
I've been trying to hit that for years.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.468
All right! Cards on the table, broseph,

11:17.552 --> 11:19.971
I'm trying to do the same thing,

11:20.054 --> 11:21.264
and you're kind of in my way.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.225
Well, then game on, brotato.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.895
-Game on.
-[chuckling]

11:29.981 --> 11:33.359
[Kimmy] Whoa! This is just like
<i>Saved by the Bell: The College Years,</i>

11:33.443 --> 11:35.278
'cause Elizabeth Berkley's
not here either.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.698
Alcohol tastes good. I like it.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.492
[hip-hop music playing]

11:41.576 --> 11:43.119
Oh, I get it!

11:43.202 --> 11:45.622
She's doing that to him with her butt.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.332
She's in control.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.334
Call me a feminist,

11:49.417 --> 11:52.211
but I think women can handle
just as many drinks as men.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.882
Would you consent to dance with me?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.467
Sure!

11:57.550 --> 11:59.594
Oh, but I don't know this dance
like Paige does,

11:59.677 --> 12:00.887
so maybe you could lead.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.848
<i>♪ I miss the first kiss</i>
<i>With a wish list to seek bliss ♪</i>

12:03.932 --> 12:05.475
<i>♪ And I meant this in an instant ♪</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:07.518
<i>♪ I'm all grown with no blueprint ♪</i>

12:07.602 --> 12:10.855
<i>♪ I know that life change</i>
<i>And memories are like a dream ♪</i>

12:12.148 --> 12:14.150
[Jacqueline sighs]

12:15.068 --> 12:16.277
What are you still doing here, Ti--

12:16.361 --> 12:17.946
My name is not Flouncy Magoo,

12:18.029 --> 12:19.447
like you were about to say.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.242
Duke figured out I was lying.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.327
You're just gonna out yourself?

12:24.410 --> 12:26.913
That's a ballsy move there, Cork.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.082
Jacqueline, I'm straight.

12:29.165 --> 12:30.833
-Hmm?
-And I'm in love with you.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.712
Also, my name is Cork Rockingham.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.132
<i>You're</i> Cork Rockingham?

12:38.216 --> 12:40.093
I mean you're <i>Cork Rockingham</i> ?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.470
You lied to me!

12:42.553 --> 12:43.763
Get out of my house!

12:44.847 --> 12:46.599
Um, okay.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.519
No! Wait.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.981
Did you mean what you told me that night
at the Foxwoods Casino?

12:53.064 --> 12:55.566
You better believe it, baby, baby!

12:55.650 --> 12:59.028
Oh, Cork, I'm so confused.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.780
Wow.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.907
I guess you forced my hand.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.243
Look. I know I said I came here
to apologize,

13:05.326 --> 13:07.286
but ever since that kiss,

13:07.370 --> 13:09.372
I can't stop thinking about you.

13:09.455 --> 13:13.209
You're both crazy. I'm a married woman.

13:13.292 --> 13:16.713
But if I were to take a lover,
you're both exactly my type.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.174
How could I ever choose? Dance for me.

13:23.469 --> 13:24.512
Cork.

13:30.059 --> 13:34.313
I say the highest and hardest
glass ceiling is the NFL.

13:34.397 --> 13:37.316
How about, "<i>She's</i> going to Disneyland"?

13:37.400 --> 13:40.695
Why do people keep saying "glass ceiling"
like it's a bad thing?

13:40.778 --> 13:42.613
Clouds! Stars!

13:42.697 --> 13:45.033
-Ha! And what if a cat got up there?
-[laughs]

13:45.116 --> 13:47.618
And sat on it. [laughs]

13:47.702 --> 13:49.954
-You're really funny, Kimmy.
-Yeah.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.581
But before we do this,

13:51.664 --> 13:54.167
let's review each other's
sexual consent forms.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.335
I'm sorry. What is this?

13:56.419 --> 13:57.587
It's what I'm agreeing
to let you do to me.

13:57.670 --> 13:58.838
Oh. No.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.132
Austin, I like you, but I just met you.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.092
I'm not gonna-- Oh, come on!

14:03.176 --> 14:05.887
Thumbs are for hitchhiking
and being Fonzie.

14:07.930 --> 14:09.599
You're rejecting me?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.143
You're a bully!

14:16.355 --> 14:19.192
Mommy, a girl thinks I'm not special.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.861
I need to take a semester off,
maybe in Greece,

14:21.944 --> 14:23.821
or an internship at <i>Late Night.</i>

14:23.905 --> 14:26.574
No! You call Mike Shoemaker!

14:26.657 --> 14:27.992
Yes, Mommy.

14:28.076 --> 14:29.952
Like, an Ivy League eight.

14:30.036 --> 14:30.995
Okay.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.497
Okay, here she is.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.710
Ma'am?

14:37.794 --> 14:40.963
No, I didn't know Austin
got extra time on tests.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.799
What does that have to do with--

14:42.882 --> 14:45.885
Yes, 17 is young to be in college.

14:46.594 --> 14:47.762
You're only 17?

14:49.055 --> 14:50.556
You're a baby!

14:52.016 --> 14:55.019
[chatter and wailing]

14:56.813 --> 14:58.856
[woman] This is the best night of my life!

14:58.940 --> 15:00.817
They're all babies.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.652
[slurred] I'm not a baby.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.987
You all seem so smart, but you don't know

15:05.071 --> 15:06.948
what the heck you're doing...

15:07.031 --> 15:08.950
like a monkey in a lab coat

15:09.033 --> 15:12.036
or an actor wearing glasses.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.496
I'm taking you home.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.962
You were right, Mommy.
She left with another girl.

15:22.130 --> 15:24.215
You're such a smart mommy.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.759
[grunting]

15:26.843 --> 15:28.678
[breathing heavily]

15:28.761 --> 15:31.222
[grunting] Six.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.224
-Whew!
-Oh!

15:33.307 --> 15:34.892
Yeah, I played a little football.

15:34.976 --> 15:37.478
I was linebacker at St. Albans School
for Boys and Their Nannies.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.897
Oh, yeah? I was a running back

15:39.981 --> 15:42.275
at Carl Lee Hailey High School
down in Mississippi.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.735
Really, Cork? You played football?

15:44.819 --> 15:48.322
For real. I was All-State, girl.
I met the governor!

15:48.406 --> 15:51.492
RB, huh? Let's see if you can get past
the Dukester.

15:51.576 --> 15:53.161
Oh, do it! Kill each other!

15:53.244 --> 15:56.873
Oh, no, I'm pretty full of pudding, so--

15:59.125 --> 16:01.752
That's how we do it
in Crab Mansion, Maryland!

16:05.006 --> 16:07.884
Oh, no! I hate this.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.135
Oh...

16:09.218 --> 16:11.012
-[both grunting]
-You're hurting me, bro.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.555
-Give up, Cork?
-Never!

16:12.638 --> 16:14.515
I bet you can't force my legs apart.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.226
[Duke] Oh, yeah? [grunts]

16:17.310 --> 16:18.895
What the hell happened out there?

16:18.978 --> 16:21.272
And when did I take off my wedding ring?

16:21.355 --> 16:24.233
Sorry, Cork, but you shouldn't have
dared me to bite you!

16:25.067 --> 16:28.070
[sighs] My sexual compass
is all a-twirly-girly.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.197
He's not even my type.

16:29.280 --> 16:32.200
But I have not been touched like that
since Mikey left.

16:32.283 --> 16:33.784
Ugh, I'm so lonely.

16:33.868 --> 16:37.038
You're lonely? My husband is lying
in a hospital bed right now,

16:37.121 --> 16:39.999
and I haven't been touched by a man
since I left Julian.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.627
-What about Russ?
-What about Russ?

16:42.710 --> 16:44.378
And Duke <i>is</i> my type.

16:44.462 --> 16:47.632
Rich, mean, knows a lot about watches.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.760
I don't need you here
just to keep Duke away from me.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.887
I need you here to keep me away from him.

16:52.970 --> 16:56.015
-So what do we do?
-We got to scratch this itch, baby!

16:56.098 --> 16:58.059
[both breathing heavily]

16:58.142 --> 17:00.019
[both moaning]

17:03.022 --> 17:06.400
[both moaning]

17:06.483 --> 17:09.111
-Is that how straight people kiss?
-Is that how gay people kiss?

17:09.194 --> 17:10.780
This is getting out of hand.

17:10.863 --> 17:12.198
We got to shut it down.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.657
I'm calling the White Widow.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.579
Uh-huh, uh-huh. I overstand.

17:19.664 --> 17:22.458
Uh, put on a Holocaust movie
till I get there.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.008
[Perry] Everyone please stay seated,

17:31.092 --> 17:32.969
and, white passengers, for the last time,

17:33.052 --> 17:35.304
please do not touch my hair.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.807
-Hi.
-[Perry] Kimmy!

17:37.890 --> 17:40.685
I was worried about you.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.186
When a girl behaves like that
at the beginning

17:42.270 --> 17:44.647
of a <i>Law & Order </i> episode,
it does not end well.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.817
Yeah. Sorry I was so weird earlier.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.402
That was not me.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.487
These clothes aren't me.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.531
And I've never done drugs in my life.

17:53.614 --> 17:57.034
Like Phylicia Rashad said
on that poster in my middle school,

17:57.118 --> 17:59.328
"The only drug you need is reading."

17:59.412 --> 18:00.955
She came to my school once.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.331
She said we were hopeless.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.584
I should never have listened
to those girls.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.210
I mean, they're just kids.

18:06.294 --> 18:07.587
Tall kids with big words.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.505
-And they're so confident!
-I know!

18:09.589 --> 18:11.340
That's why it took me so long to realize

18:11.424 --> 18:14.302
they're just doing normal,
dumb teenager stuff.

18:14.385 --> 18:17.972
The drinking, the clothes,
the all-night French-a-thons.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.890
Thumby-thumby-thumby-thumby.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.518
Oh, she should not be sucking
on her thumb.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.061
You know where kids put those these days?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.648
Well, we were all teenagers once, right?

18:27.732 --> 18:29.692
Wilding out, acting crazy.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.402
Not me.

18:32.778 --> 18:33.779
Me either.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.833
I'm not sure we missed anything.

18:46.667 --> 18:47.752
[chuckles]

18:49.337 --> 18:50.546
Mmm.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.632
Looks like I'm winning, Cork,

18:52.715 --> 18:54.550
like I win at everything:

18:54.634 --> 18:55.926
football, business,

18:56.010 --> 18:57.928
spotting the differences
between two drawings

18:58.012 --> 19:00.681
that look the same but there are actually
a few tiny differences.

19:00.765 --> 19:01.974
[door opens]

19:05.144 --> 19:08.731
May I help you?
We're trying to have a sexy evening here.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.984
[with heavy accent]
Ah! I am your downstairs neighbor,

19:12.068 --> 19:14.612
Isabellica Delmonicos.

19:14.695 --> 19:17.948
Yep, I am one of the rich A-holes

19:18.032 --> 19:19.742
who live in this building.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.285
I work in finance,

19:21.369 --> 19:23.871
producing nothing, destroying everything.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.831
God, I suck!

19:27.166 --> 19:30.920
Also, I got a leak in my apartment.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.548
I think it's coming from your bathroom.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.347
What the hell's going on?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.432
It stinks like puberty out there.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.142
There's too many layers, Isabellica.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.769
I can't keep track.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.062
Am I still Jacqueline?

19:48.145 --> 19:49.855
You let things go too far.

19:49.939 --> 19:53.442
This isn't just your
run-of-the-mill cock-block no more.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.611
Now you actually got to choose
