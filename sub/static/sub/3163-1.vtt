00:44.545 --> 00:47.715
Hang me, oh, hang me

00:48.840 --> 00:52.340
<i>I'll be dead and gone</i>

00:53.512 --> 00:57.387
<i>Hang me, oh, hang me</i>

00:57.891 --> 01:01.470
<i>I'll be dead and gone</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:05.728
<i>I wouldn't mind the hanging</i>

01:05.899 --> 01:10.695
<i>But the laying in the grave so long
Poor boy</i>

01:10.696 --> 01:16.528
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

01:18.495 --> 01:22.245
<i>Been all around Cape Girardeau</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:26.378
<i>Parts of Arkansas</i>

01:27.588 --> 01:31.509
<i>All around Cape Girardeau</i>

01:31.967 --> 01:35.762
<i>Parts of Arkansas</i>

01:36.555 --> 01:39.890
<i>I got so goddamn hungry</i>

01:39.891 --> 01:44.895
<i>I could hide behind a straw
Poor boy</i>

01:44.896 --> 01:49.476
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:56.279
<i>Went up on the mountain</i>

01:57.034 --> 02:00.454
<i>There I made my stand</i>

02:01.580 --> 02:05.333
<i>Went up on the mountain</i>

02:05.334 --> 02:09.380
<i>There I made my stand</i>

02:09.963 --> 02:14.133
<i>A rifle on my shoulder</i>

02:14.134 --> 02:18.429
<i>And a dagger in my hand
Poor boy</i>

02:18.430 --> 02:23.932
<i>I been all around this world</i>

02:26.229 --> 02:29.808
<i>Put the rope around my neck</i>

02:30.484 --> 02:33.733
<i>Hang me up so high</i>

02:34.780 --> 02:38.574
<i>Put the rope around my neck</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:42.075
<i>They hung me up so high</i>

02:42.913 --> 02:47.041
<i>The last words I heard 'em say:</i>

02:47.042 --> 02:51.420
<i>"Won't be long now 'fore you die
Poor boy"</i>

02:51.421 --> 02:56.718
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

02:58.929 --> 03:03.099
<i>So hang me, oh, hang me</i>

03:03.100 --> 03:07.521
<i>And I'll be dead and gone</i>

03:08.522 --> 03:12.066
<i>Hang me, oh, hang me</i>

03:12.067 --> 03:16.773
<i>And I'll be dead and gone</i>

03:17.447 --> 03:21.033
<i>Wouldn't mind the hanging</i>

03:21.034 --> 03:25.579
<i>But the laying in the grave so long
Poor boy</i>

03:25.580 --> 03:30.502
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:47.177
You probably heard
that one before.

03:48.228 --> 03:51.105
If it was never new and it never
gets old, then it's a folk song.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.607
- You and Mikey used to do that song.
- Yeah.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.616
Boy, you were some mess last night.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.286
Yeah, sorry, Pappi.
I'm an asshole.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.748
I don't give a shit.
It's just music.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.293
Your friend is out back.

04:11.334 --> 04:12.626
My friend?

04:12.627 --> 04:16.673
Said he was a friend
of yours. Guy in a suit.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.597
You a funny boy, huh?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.726
What?

04:36.485 --> 04:40.070
Had to open your big mouth,
huh, funny boy?

04:40.071 --> 04:42.069
I had to... What?

04:43.074 --> 04:46.660
That's what I do for a living.
Who...? Who are you?

04:46.661 --> 04:48.863
What you do.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.204
What you do.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.336
I'm sorry, what...? What did I...?

04:57.214 --> 05:01.217
You sit there in the audience
last night, yelling your crap.

05:01.218 --> 05:03.967
Oh, for christssake.
You yell stuff, man. It's a show.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.349
It wasn't your show.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.727
It's not the opera, jackass.
It's a fucking basket hou... Unh!

05:11.728 --> 05:15.808
We're leaving this fucking cesspool.
You can have it.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.852
What you do.

05:49.140 --> 05:51.138
Hello?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.973
No, no...

07:12.474 --> 07:13.682
Shit.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.022
Goddamn it.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.540
Hello?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.749
Hi.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.883
Could you, um...?

07:47.884 --> 07:49.631
Could I leave this cat with you?

07:50.053 --> 07:52.513
- With me?
- Yeah, it's, um...

07:52.514 --> 07:55.058
It's the Gorfeins' cat.
Just till one of them gets back?

07:55.100 --> 07:56.308
With me?

07:56.309 --> 07:58.394
It slipped out
and I don't have the key.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.396
Could you just keep it
till they get back?

08:00.397 --> 08:03.020
I have to run the elevator.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.487
I mean, that's not a problem, is it?
It's the Gorfeins' cat.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.190
I have to run the elevator.

08:11.574 --> 08:14.076
- Sociology.
- Professor Gorfein, please.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.369
<i>He's in a lecture now.</i>

08:15.370 --> 08:17.163
<i>- Could I take a message?
- Uh...</i>

08:17.455 --> 08:19.915
Yeah, could you...?
Could you just tell him:

08:19.916 --> 08:22.251
"Don't worry, Llewyn has the cat"?

08:22.252 --> 08:24.461
<i>"Llewyn is the cat."</i>

08:24.462 --> 08:28.337
No, Llewyn "has" the cat.
I'm Llewyn. I have his cat.

09:21.436 --> 09:22.728
Oh, shit.

10:14.030 --> 10:16.865
- Hey, Nunzio.
- Yeah. They ain't home, though.

10:16.866 --> 10:19.068
Yeah, I know.
Can I use your fire escape?

10:43.143 --> 10:45.016
Hi.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.151
- How we doing?
- We're doing great.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.527
Really?

10:53.528 --> 10:55.237
The new record's doing well?

10:55.238 --> 10:58.740
Uh, how "we" doing.
Not so hot, I gotta be honest.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.618
- Ginny, where's Cincinnati?
- What?

11:01.619 --> 11:04.955
- Cincinnati, it's not in here.
- It should be in there.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.457
It's not in here, I'm telling you.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.750
- Is it...?
- Cincinnati?

11:08.751 --> 11:10.836
- Yeah.
- I got it.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.129
What?

11:12.130 --> 11:14.923
- I got it.
- You got Cincinnati?

11:14.924 --> 11:16.341
Yeah, you want it?

11:16.342 --> 11:18.385
- Could I have it?
- Should I bring it in?

11:18.386 --> 11:20.804
- Yeah.
- Do you owe me something?

11:20.805 --> 11:22.472
You have to owe me something.

11:22.473 --> 11:23.891
I wish.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.893
People need time, you know.

11:25.894 --> 11:29.062
Get to know you,
buy you as a solo act.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.607
Even know you're a solo act.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.526
- Cincinnati is not good.
- That's it, right?

11:34.527 --> 11:36.361
Yeah, this is it, God help me.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.197
Nobody knew us
when we were a duo.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.574
It's not like me and Mike
were ever a big act.

11:40.575 --> 11:43.076
It's not a big reeducation

11:43.077 --> 11:44.779
for the public.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.660
Mel?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.410
Mel.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.666
How you doing, kid?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.924
Mel, there was no advance
on my solo record.

11:56.925 --> 11:58.717
There's gotta be some royalty.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.137
Fucking christssake, it's cold out.
I don't even have a winter coat.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.717
Jesus Christ. You're kidding me.

12:11.314 --> 12:14.233
- Take this, kid.
- Mel, no.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.442
I insist. I insist.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.778
I don't want your fucking coat.
What'll you wear?

12:17.779 --> 12:20.781
- Kid, I'll get by.
- It won't even fit me. This is...

12:20.782 --> 12:22.407
It's bullshit, Mel.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.327
It's just a big fat fucking bluff.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.658
Bluff?

12:27.080 --> 12:31.583
Kid, what are you ta...? Bluff?
I offer you this?

12:31.584 --> 12:35.084
Get the fuck out of my office.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.881
- All right, thanks for the coat.
- What?

12:37.882 --> 12:39.709
All right, well, wait.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.511
Aw, shit.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.882
Let me give you 40 bucks.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.822
- Explain the cat.
- Yeah, sorry.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.741
It's, uh... It's the Gorfeins' cat.

13:04.742 --> 13:07.536
- I crashed there last night.
- What's its name?

13:07.537 --> 13:10.664
Uh, I don't know.
He snuck out the door when...

13:10.665 --> 13:12.666
Do you think you're
staying here tonight?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.335
"Do you think...?" Um...

13:15.086 --> 13:17.337
- I was hoping to. Is Jim around?
- Jim's not here.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.548
We told Troy he could crash here.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.174
Troy Nelson. How are you?

13:21.175 --> 13:23.427
- How you doing? Llewyn Davis.
- Oh.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.679
Hello. I've heard your music,

13:25.680 --> 13:29.683
and heard many nice things about you
from Jim and Jean and from others.

13:29.684 --> 13:33.895
Ha-ha-ha. You have not heard
one nice thing about me from Jean,

13:33.896 --> 13:35.480
ever, have you, Troy?

13:35.481 --> 13:37.649
You tell the Gorfeins
you'll take care of their cat,

13:37.650 --> 13:39.484
then bring him here
for us to take care of.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.529
I've heard nice things from
Jim and Jean and others.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.489
I didn't... It just happened.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.284
It's a peaceful cat.
It's very contented.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.370
So I can't stay here tonight?

13:50.371 --> 13:52.497
Look, we told Troy he could stay.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.121
We don't keep the couch free
on the chance you'll show up.

13:55.710 --> 13:56.918
If this is awkward,

13:56.919 --> 13:59.379
I could hitch back to Fort Dix
after I perform tonight.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.381
Don't be silly.
We offered you the couch.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.966
You're gigging somewhere?

14:02.967 --> 14:05.385
Troy is playing at the Gaslight.
We're meeting Jim there.

14:05.386 --> 14:09.264
Well, I could sleep on the floor here,
and Llewyn could have the couch.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.641
I'm certainly not a
man of comforts.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.265
Alternately, I could hitch back
to Fort Dix after the show.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.939
Llewyn can sleep on the
floor with his cat.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.938
It's the Gorfeins' cat.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.731
What the fuck?

14:26.949 --> 14:31.746
<i>It's a lesson too late
For the learner</i>

14:32.497 --> 14:38.079
<i>Made of sand, made of sand</i>

14:38.586 --> 14:44.132
<i>In the wink of an eye
My soul is turning</i>

14:44.133 --> 14:49.930
<i>In your hand, in your hand</i>

14:49.931 --> 14:56.144
<i>Are you going away
With no word of farewell?</i>

14:56.145 --> 15:02.692
<i>Will there be not a trace left behind?
Well, I could've loved you better</i>

15:02.693 --> 15:03.902
- Llewyn.
- Hey.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.570
- Good to see you.
- Hey.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.906
<i>I didn't mean to be unkind</i>

15:07.907 --> 15:13.113
<i>You know that was
The last thing on my mind</i>

15:13.830 --> 15:19.082
<i>You've got reasons aplenty
For going</i>

15:19.419 --> 15:23.004
- What do you think?
- What?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.424
Him, Troy.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.717
Wonderful performer.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.887
- Is he?
- Wonderful.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.889
<i>Please don't go</i>

15:32.890 --> 15:36.852
- Does he have a higher function?
- Shh!

15:36.853 --> 15:38.895
<i>Are you going away</i>

15:38.896 --> 15:40.105
I need a drink.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.024
<i>With no word of farewell?</i>

15:43.025 --> 15:44.234
<i>Will there be not a change</i>

15:44.235 --> 15:46.361
Look, Jim,
I didn't wanna mention this

15:46.362 --> 15:48.572
in front of Jean.
You know how she gets.

15:48.573 --> 15:52.619
- What do you mean?
- Just, uh, you know...

15:52.910 --> 15:56.663
I need to...
I need to borrow some money.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.999
I can pay you back really soon,
that and the last loan.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.626
There's a girl I know who's in trouble
and needs to get fixed.

16:01.627 --> 16:04.421
- Not again.
- This is a different girl.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.590
Don't tell Jean.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.010
I can't get the money
without Jean knowing.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.387
- It's okay. We can...
- No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.681
I'll find it somewhere else.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.099
Thank you very much.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.098
Thank you.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.106
There's someone special
in the audience tonight

16:23.107 --> 16:25.066
who'll maybe get up
and help me out here

16:25.067 --> 16:27.569
- if you give a round of applause.
- I don't have my guitar.

16:27.570 --> 16:29.529
I know that you folks know them
and love them.

16:29.530 --> 16:33.325
Ladies and gentlemen,
Jim and Jean.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.244
Oh.

16:57.475 --> 17:01.686
<i>If you miss the train I'm on</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:05.815
<i>You will know that I am gone</i>

17:05.816 --> 17:09.736
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

17:09.737 --> 17:13.990
<i>A hundred miles</i>

17:13.991 --> 17:18.078
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

17:18.079 --> 17:22.499
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

17:22.500 --> 17:26.377
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

17:26.378 --> 17:30.425
<i>A hundred miles</i>

17:30.758 --> 17:34.970
<i>Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two</i>

17:34.971 --> 17:39.051
<i>Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four</i>

17:39.225 --> 17:43.228
<i>Lord, I'm 500 miles</i>

17:43.229 --> 17:47.399
<i>Away from home</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:55.949
<i>Away from home, away from home</i>

17:55.950 --> 17:59.869
<i>Lord, I'm 500 miles</i>

17:59.870 --> 18:03.916
<i>Away from home</i>

18:04.333 --> 18:08.795
<i>Not a shirt on my back</i>

18:08.796 --> 18:12.507
<i>Not a penny to my name</i>

18:12.508 --> 18:18.305
<i>Lord, I can't go back home
This a-way</i>

18:18.306 --> 18:19.553
<i>What?</i>

18:20.600 --> 18:28.857
<i>This a-way, this</i> a-way

18:28.858 --> 18:33.153
<i>Lord, I can't go back home</i>

18:33.154 --> 18:36.904
<i>This a-way</i>

18:37.241 --> 18:41.411
<i>If you miss the train I'm on</i>

18:41.412 --> 18:43.705
<i>You will know that I am gone</i>

18:43.706 --> 18:45.498
Boy, they're not bad.

18:45.499 --> 18:46.875
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

18:46.876 --> 18:48.749
Uh-huh.

18:49.420 --> 18:50.629
That Jean,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.631
<i>A hundred miles</i>

18:52.632 --> 18:54.090
I'd like to fuck her.

18:54.091 --> 19:02.724
<i>A hundred miles, a hundred miles</i>

19:02.725 --> 19:07.687
<i>You can hear the whistle blow</i>

19:07.688 --> 19:12.143
<i>A hundred miles</i>

19:37.802 --> 19:39.219
Mm.

19:39.220 --> 19:41.012
Sorry.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.716
It's early.
I tried not to wake anyone.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.975
Mm-hm.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.326
Well, that was very good.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.163
What's next?

20:11.252 --> 20:12.704
What do you mean?

20:14.463 --> 20:17.792
Do you plug yourself in somewhere?

20:20.511 --> 20:21.758
No.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.977
Well,

20:28.978 --> 20:30.475
report for duty.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.481
Back to Fort Dix.

20:32.857 --> 20:35.185
They making you a killing machine?

20:35.860 --> 20:38.987
No, it's probably different
from what you imagine.

20:38.988 --> 20:42.741
There's the discipline,
which is what you're referring to.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.033
I thrive on that.

20:44.034 --> 20:46.202
Weaponry is part of the job.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.828
Armaments are not my thing.
I don't even approve of war toys.

20:50.458 --> 20:53.662
- Is it a career?
- No, no. I get out in a few months.

20:54.712 --> 20:57.461
Bud Grossman has expressed
interest in representing me.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.924
Bud Grossman?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.048
What's he like?

21:02.470 --> 21:06.140
Mr. Grossman is a wonderful man.
He's been very supportive.

21:07.516 --> 21:10.101
I played at his club in Chicago
on my last furlough,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.145
right after I got
back from Germany.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.813
Did you meet Elvis?

21:13.814 --> 21:16.608
No. Everyone asks that.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.653
No, I did not meet Private Presley.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.447
So you played at the Gate of Horn.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.948
Yes.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.076
Mr. Grossman liked what he saw,
I guess.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.029
He thinks I can have a career.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.115
Hm.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.376
Thank Jim and Jean for me.

21:35.377 --> 21:37.128
Mm-hm.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.376
So long.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.091
What's your name again?

21:49.099 --> 21:50.475
Oh, shit.

21:50.476 --> 21:52.268
No. No.

21:52.269 --> 21:55.769
Fuck. Goddamn it. Oh, shit.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.526
Fuck.

21:59.860 --> 22:02.654
Shit. Cat.

22:15.417 --> 22:18.336
Fuck. Kitty?

22:19.839 --> 22:22.667
Fuck. Fuck.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.110
Thanks for keeping quiet, asshole.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.945
I'm freezing. Can we talk?

22:43.946 --> 22:45.568
Not here. Fuck you.

22:46.323 --> 22:48.658
I'm sorry, which?
"Out" or "fuck you"?

22:48.659 --> 22:50.994
Let's go out.
Can I borrow Jim's coat?

22:50.995 --> 22:52.538
<i>I don't know.</i>

22:53.914 --> 22:57.584
- You don't know if it's mine?
- No. How would I know?

22:57.585 --> 23:01.421
- So it could be Jim's.
- Yes, asshole.

23:01.422 --> 23:04.924
Wait, you don't want it either way?
To be clear.

23:04.925 --> 23:08.177
To be clear, asshole,
you fucking asshole,

23:08.178 --> 23:11.973
I want very much to have it if
it's Jim's. That's what I want.

23:11.974 --> 23:14.183
But since I don't know,
you not only fucked things up

23:14.184 --> 23:16.227
by fucking me
and maybe making me pregnant,

23:16.228 --> 23:18.187
but even if it's not yours,
I can't know that.

23:18.188 --> 23:21.774
So I have to get rid of what might be
a perfectly fine baby, a baby I want,

23:21.775 --> 23:25.149
because everything you
touch turns to shit.

23:25.613 --> 23:27.780
Like King Midas's idiot brother.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.699
Well, okay.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.198
I see.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.660
You know a doctor, right?

23:35.748 --> 23:36.998
Yes.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.541
From when?

23:38.542 --> 23:39.959
Whatever, Diane?

23:39.960 --> 23:41.669
Yes.

23:41.670 --> 23:43.964
- And you'll pay for it?
- Yes.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.927
Don't tell Jim, obviously.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.550
I should've had you wear
double condoms.

23:56.727 --> 24:00.063
Well, we shouldn't have done it in the
first place, but if you ever do it again,

24:00.064 --> 24:03.024
which as a favor to women
everywhere, you should not,

24:03.025 --> 24:05.902
but if you do, you should be wearing
condom on condom,

24:05.903 --> 24:07.904
and then wrap it in
electrical tape.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.782
You should just walk around always
inside a great big condom

24:10.783 --> 24:12.825
- because you are shit.
- Okay.

24:12.826 --> 24:15.529
You should not be in contact
with any living thing, being shit.

24:16.622 --> 24:19.791
Have you ever heard the expression,
"it takes two to tango"?

24:19.792 --> 24:21.084
Fuck you.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.838
Well, I could say we should talk
about this when you're less angry,

24:25.839 --> 24:28.341
but that would be...

24:28.342 --> 24:30.385
That would be...

24:31.220 --> 24:33.514
- When would that be?
- Fuck you.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.314
I miss Mike.

24:43.732 --> 24:45.900
Can I ask you for a favor?

24:47.444 --> 24:48.691
You're joking.

24:49.154 --> 24:51.322
It's not for me,
it's for the Gorfeins.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.778
Their cat got out. Could you leave
the fire-escape window open?

24:56.203 --> 24:57.412
It's winter.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.247
Just enough for the cat
to squeeze back in?

24:59.248 --> 25:00.456
It could come back.

25:00.457 --> 25:03.167
To our apartment?
It was there, like, six hours.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.544
Why would it come back there?

25:04.545 --> 25:06.587
I don't know,
I'm not a fucking cat.

25:06.588 --> 25:10.174
Think about it. I lost their fucking cat.
I feel bad about it.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.219
That's what you feel bad about?

25:29.069 --> 25:30.653
Hello.

25:30.654 --> 25:31.901
Where's your coat?

25:32.573 --> 25:34.821
- It's not that cold.
- You out of your mind?

25:37.953 --> 25:39.996
So how's the music going?

25:40.039 --> 25:42.665
Uh, pretty good. Pretty good.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.664
Oh, good. So you don't need
to borrow money.

25:47.254 --> 25:50.131
- Actually, I was wondering...
- Uh-huh.

25:50.132 --> 25:51.340
Is it sold?

25:51.341 --> 25:53.342
- The house?
- Yeah.

25:53.343 --> 25:55.136
Yeah. Uh-huh.

25:55.304 --> 25:57.847
- I mean, it's in escrow.
- How much?

25:57.848 --> 25:59.807
Eleven-five. But why?

25:59.808 --> 26:02.560
- It's not our house.
- Not our house?

26:02.561 --> 26:05.480
Well, yeah.
It's Mom and Dad's house.

26:05.481 --> 26:09.857
Llewyn, it goes to his upkeep.
We don't get any.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.065
Good thing your
music's going good.

26:14.323 --> 26:17.075
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, well, what the fuck?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.659
- Llewyn.
- What?

26:18.660 --> 26:21.079
- The language.
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

26:21.080 --> 26:23.372
I am not one of your
Greenwich Village friends.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.825
Okay, yeah, yeah.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.628
- You still got your seaman's papers?
- Yeah, why?

26:28.629 --> 26:32.215
- Well, if the music's not...
- What? Quit?

26:32.216 --> 26:34.839
Merchant Marine again?

26:35.094 --> 26:36.302
Just exist?

26:36.303 --> 26:38.054
Heh, exist?

26:38.055 --> 26:40.056
Is that what we do
outside of show business?

26:40.057 --> 26:41.766
It's not so bad, existing.

26:41.767 --> 26:43.434
- Like Dad?
- Llewyn.

26:43.435 --> 26:45.394
- What?
- You say that about your own father?

26:45.395 --> 26:46.646
- What?
- That he exists?

26:46.647 --> 26:49.524
- I didn't say... You said it. Forget it.
- That he exists? Like that?

26:49.525 --> 26:52.103
Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.

26:52.152 --> 26:53.778
- Seen him?
- Yeah.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.447
What?

26:55.489 --> 26:58.533
- Should I?
- You tell me, he's your father.

26:58.700 --> 27:00.368
Yeah, he sure is.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.539
Oh, I got... Wait, I got...
You got a minute?

27:05.082 --> 27:09.752
Well, they want me back
for rehearsals.

27:09.753 --> 27:11.838
<i>Sullivan Show.</i>

27:11.839 --> 27:14.508
I've got autographs to sign.

27:14.675 --> 27:18.094
- Champagne reception.
- Don't go away.

27:18.095 --> 27:20.263
I cleaned it out, the house.

27:20.264 --> 27:23.434
There's some stuff.
I put your stuff in a box.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.432
What I thought you might want.

27:27.604 --> 27:29.438
I don't know, Joy.

27:29.439 --> 27:31.149
Just stick it out at the curb.

27:31.150 --> 27:34.026
Llewyn, are you kidding?
Look at this.

27:34.027 --> 27:35.729
You know what this is?

27:35.904 --> 27:38.698
This is when you recorded
"Shoals of Herring" for Morn and Dad.

27:38.699 --> 27:41.868
You... Whatever, you're
like 8 years old. It's so cute.

27:41.869 --> 27:46.372
Well, see, Joy, in the
entertainment business,

27:46.373 --> 27:49.497
you're not supposed to let
your practice shit out.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.836
It ruins the mystique.

27:51.837 --> 27:54.790
I'm sorry. I don't know a lot about
the entertainment business.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.170
Yeah, well...

27:56.925 --> 27:58.923
Don't be sorry.

27:59.678 --> 28:03.055
No, no, no, I'll bring the cat up.
It's fine. I just, uh...

28:03.056 --> 28:06.309
I can't today, as it turns out.
I can't bring her today.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.102
<i>- Him.</i>
- Him, him, yeah.

28:08.103 --> 28:11.063
<i>- But I can get down there.</i>
- He's hanging out at Jim and Jean's.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.273
He's... He likes it there.

28:12.274 --> 28:15.026
- He's fine. Believe me, he's fine.
<i>- Okay. But it's easy for me...</i>

28:15.027 --> 28:16.694
- No, no, no. They're not home.
<i>- Okay.</i>

28:16.695 --> 28:18.654
- They're never home.
<i>- All right.</i>

28:18.655 --> 28:20.656
Uh, so... Anyway,
I couldn't ask you to do that.

28:20.657 --> 28:22.575
All the way down to the Village,
Mitch.

28:22.576 --> 28:23.993
No, I'll bring her up tomorrow.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.078
- Him. Him up tomorrow.
<i>- Right. Okay, good.</i>

28:26.079 --> 28:28.998
<i>And remember to call Jim.
He said it was urgent.</i>

28:28.999 --> 28:31.334
Yeah, I doubt if it's urgent,
but I'll call him. Thanks.

28:31.335 --> 28:32.627
<i>No, no, he said it's urgent.</i>

28:32.628 --> 28:35.171
<i>It's a session this
afternoon at Columbia.</i>

28:35.172 --> 28:37.924
<i>Somebody got sick and dropped out.
He thought you'd like the work.</i>

28:37.925 --> 28:40.509
What? What?

28:40.510 --> 28:43.346
- Did he say that I need my guitar?
<i>- I think he mentioned a guitar.</i>

28:43.347 --> 28:46.596
Do I need my guitar? Hello?

28:49.686 --> 28:52.188
Hi, I'm here for Mr. Cromartie's
session. Llewyn Davis.

28:52.189 --> 28:54.642
Have a seat.
I'll let him know you're here.

29:02.699 --> 29:04.776
Llewyn.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.913
Mr. Cromartie,
it's an honor to meet you.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.374
Heh. Where's your guitar?

29:14.628 --> 29:15.962
Hey.

29:15.963 --> 29:17.380
- Hey, man, you made it.
- Yeah.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.174
- You'll play a Gibson, right?
- Yours? Sure, yeah.

29:20.175 --> 29:23.094
- You playing, uh...?
- Triple-O 21. Do you know Al Cody?

29:23.095 --> 29:24.804
- Hey, man. Hey.
- Hi.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.639
Can you read a chart, Llewyn?

29:26.640 --> 29:27.848
I, uh...

29:27.849 --> 29:30.351
I can stare at a chart
and fake it, sir.

29:30.352 --> 29:33.229
All right.
Jim and Al will teach you the song.

29:33.230 --> 29:34.897
Take your time.
We're here to have fun.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.232
All right.

29:36.233 --> 29:37.692
So we're, uh...?

29:37.693 --> 29:39.443
We're the what?
The John Glenn Singers?

29:39.444 --> 29:42.363
It's not the most serious music
we've recorded at this studio.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.864
Uh...

29:43.865 --> 29:45.408
It's a thing.

29:46.368 --> 29:50.454
<i>I don't wanna
Don't send me off into outer space</i>

29:50.455 --> 29:51.914
<i>I sweat when they put me</i>

29:51.915 --> 29:55.001
Yeah, but we wanna go to... Let's still
do the "p-p-please" into the...

29:55.002 --> 29:56.377
- Into the verse.
- Really?

29:56.378 --> 29:57.586
- Yeah.
- P-p-p

29:57.587 --> 30:00.256
<i>Don't send me off into outer...
P-p-p-p-please</i>

30:00.257 --> 30:03.509
What? No, I ca... Because then it gets
all muddled up into the verse.

30:03.510 --> 30:04.885
- No, no, no.
- Shoot.

30:04.886 --> 30:07.513
No, you just do the p-p-p's
into the ver... If you do two p-p's.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.849
- P-p, then the "sweat when they..."
- Yep.

30:09.850 --> 30:11.347
- Really?
- Yep.

30:11.685 --> 30:13.602
<i>P-p, I sweat when they stuck me</i>

30:13.603 --> 30:14.979
<i>In the pressure suit</i>

30:14.980 --> 30:16.230
Shoot.

30:16.231 --> 30:19.066
<i>Bubble helmet
Flash Gordon boots</i>

30:19.067 --> 30:22.695
<i>- No air out there, gravity...
- Ow, ow, ow</i>

30:22.696 --> 30:24.905
<i>- That's no place to be a hero
- Shoot.</i>

30:24.906 --> 30:28.280
- Okay.
- Yeah. Oh-oh-oh.

30:28.535 --> 30:30.578
Okay.

30:30.871 --> 30:34.200
Hey, look, I'm happy for the gig,
but who wrote this?

30:35.751 --> 30:37.376
I did.

30:37.377 --> 30:40.080
- You...
- Okay?

30:40.464 --> 30:42.131
So okay?

30:42.132 --> 30:44.425
- Good?
- Shoot.

30:44.426 --> 30:48.262
"Please, Mr. Kennedy"
take one. And we're rolling.

30:58.565 --> 31:00.900
<i>- Please, Mr. Kennedy
Uh-oh</i>

31:00.901 --> 31:02.109
<i>I don't wanna go</i>

31:02.110 --> 31:04.320
<i>Please don't shoot me
Into outer space</i>

31:04.321 --> 31:06.655
<i>- P-p-please
- Please, Mr. Kennedy</i>

31:06.656 --> 31:09.033
<i>- Uh-oh
- I don't wanna go</i>

31:09.034 --> 31:11.619
<i>Please don't shoot me
Into outer space</i>

31:11.620 --> 31:15.289
<i>I sweat when they stuck me
In the pressure suits</i>

31:15.290 --> 31:18.876
<i>Bubble helmet
Flash Gordon boots</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:22.213
<i>- No air up there in gravity zero

31:22.214 --> 31:23.422
<i>- I need to breathe
- Outer</i>

31:23.423 --> 31:25.549
<i>- Don't need to be a hero
- Space</i>

31:25.550 --> 31:28.219
<i>Are you reading me
loud and clear?</i>

31:28.220 --> 31:30.971
<i>- Oh, please, Mr. Kennedy
- Uh-oh</i>

31:30.972 --> 31:35.059

31:38.897 --> 31:41.646
<i>Please don't shoot me
Into outer space</i>

31:41.858 --> 31:43.651
<i>I'm 6-foot-2</i>

31:43.652 --> 31:45.653
<i>And so perhaps you'll</i>

31:45.654 --> 31:48.528
<i>Tell me how to fit into
A 5-foot capsule</i>

31:48.698 --> 31:52.284
<i>I won't be known
As Man of the Century</i>

31:52.285 --> 31:55.162

Out in the back with our kid?</i>

32:04.923 --> 32:07.174
<i>Oh, please, Mr. Kennedy</i>

32:07.175 --> 32:09.051

32:09.052 --> 32:11.554

32:36.079 --> 32:38.539
<i>Please don't shoot me
Into outer space</i>

32:38.540 --> 32:43.752
<i>- Oh, please
- Mr. Kennedy</i>

32:43.753 --> 32:45.754
No, thank you. I appreciate it.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.965
- I needed this, as you know.
- Yeah.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.588
Oh...

32:50.302 --> 32:53.346
- We'll be touring, right?
- Touring Uranus.

32:53.597 --> 32:55.639
I'll get my vaccinations.
Sign where?

32:55.640 --> 32:57.975
- You are AF of M, right?
- Yeah.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.643
Sign there and there.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.228
You don't have a label?

33:01.229 --> 33:02.646
Uh, I do. Legacy.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.356
Oh, you're exclusive to Mel?

33:04.357 --> 33:06.817
I'll need a permission.
He'll give you one.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.152
- See you.
- Uh...

33:08.153 --> 33:10.029
That's gonna take...

33:10.030 --> 33:11.857
Shit, man, I need the money now.

33:12.073 --> 33:13.949
You wanna just be
an independent contractor,

33:13.950 --> 33:15.701
Accounting will give you
a check today.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.454
Just bill us for services, $200.
That's more than a session fee

33:18.455 --> 33:21.540
- because you don't get royalties.
- Okay, that's fine. And I can cash it?

33:21.541 --> 33:22.958
Sure, right around the corner.

33:22.959 --> 33:25.586
But you don't go on a session
sheet then, <i>so</i> no royalties.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.506
That's okay, that's fine.
Hey, where do you live, Al?

33:29.132 --> 33:31.380
- Downing Street.
- Yeah, nice place?

33:32.010 --> 33:35.180
- It's a dump.
- Uh-huh. Got a couch?

33:44.397 --> 33:47.483
- Where's Mel?
- Mel's at a funeral.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.193
Boy, that man goes
to a lot of funerals.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.654
- He likes people.
- Fewer and fewer.

33:51.655 --> 33:52.905
This is family.

33:52.906 --> 33:56.534
His nephew, Georgie, is engaged
to a girl whose mother just passed.

33:56.535 --> 33:57.868
I don't know if that's family.

33:57.869 --> 34:00.496
He likes funerals.
I don't know what to tell you.

34:00.497 --> 34:04.416
I forgot to pick up my mail yesterday.
I was so pissed at Mel.

34:04.417 --> 34:06.168
You didn't forget
to pick up your mail.

34:06.169 --> 34:08.542
- Yeah, I did.
- You don't have any mail.

34:08.797 --> 34:10.623
Oh.

34:10.924 --> 34:12.842
Shit.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.427
I didn't get anything
from Bud Grossman in Chicago?

34:15.428 --> 34:17.638
You were supposed to get something
from Bud Grossman?

34:17.639 --> 34:20.056
Yeah, I had Mel send him
my solo record when it came out.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.636
- Whenever, more than a month ago.
- Oh.

34:23.353 --> 34:25.521
No, you didn't get anything.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.357
But we were making space
in the stock room

34:28.358 --> 34:31.277
and dumped the rest
of the old records.

34:31.277 --> 34:34.152
All the remainders.

34:38.243 --> 34:39.989
Yours and Mikey's.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.789
Mel set one box aside.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.960
Thought you might wanna
keep some copies.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.838
What am I gonna do with them?

34:50.839 --> 34:52.882
Should I throw them out?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.514
- Oh, good.
- Hey.

35:00.515 --> 35:02.349
Here's a key.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.060
Just going out to Jersey
to pick up my mom's car.

35:05.061 --> 35:08.105
- Okay. Oh! Sorry. okay.
- Ha-ha-ha.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.704
Mm-hm.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.038
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- Hey, it's me, Llewyn.

36:06.039 --> 36:08.540
- Yeah?
- Can I come up?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.584
No.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.128
Okay.

36:13.129 --> 36:14.626
Well...

36:14.714 --> 36:16.882
Well, can I have my stuff?

36:16.883 --> 36:19.256
<i>I'll bring it down.
I'll meet you at the Reggie.</i>

36:24.349 --> 36:25.891
Hey.

36:25.892 --> 36:27.765
Thank you.

36:29.979 --> 36:32.682
- Who won the lottery tonight?
- Huh?

36:33.358 --> 36:36.778
Oh. I'm staying at Al Cody's.

36:38.113 --> 36:41.198
So when do you wanna do the...?

36:41.199 --> 36:43.242
- Have the...?
- The abortion?

36:43.493 --> 36:45.369
The sooner the better.

36:45.370 --> 36:48.122
Okay. I'll see when
the guy can do it then.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.958
"The guy"? I hope it's a doctor.

36:50.959 --> 36:52.751
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's a doctor.

36:52.752 --> 36:55.462
- You got the money?
- Yes, I have the money, don't worry.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.506
- With you, I worry.
- Well, you shouldn't.

36:57.507 --> 36:59.049
Yes, I should.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.509
God knows you never do.

37:00.510 --> 37:03.345
You just let other people,
like your method of birth control.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.764
Oh, please don't start
with the double condoms again.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.593
Do you ever think
about the future at all?

37:09.477 --> 37:11.353
The future?

37:11.354 --> 37:13.564
You mean, like flying cars?

37:13.565 --> 37:15.774
Hotels on the moon?

37:15.775 --> 37:17.776
- Tang?
- And this is why you're fucked.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.486
No, it's why you're fucked.

37:19.487 --> 37:22.281
You're just trying
to blueprint a future.

37:22.282 --> 37:25.284
Move to the suburbs with Jim,
have kids.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.536
- That's bad?
- If that's what music is for you,

37:27.537 --> 37:30.873
a way to get to that place,
then, yeah, it's a little careerist,

37:30.874 --> 37:33.247
and it's a little square,

37:33.626 --> 37:36.211
- and it's a little sad.
- I'm sad?

37:36.212 --> 37:38.172
You're the one who's
not getting anywhere.

37:38.173 --> 37:40.340
You don't wanna get anywhere.
Me and Jim try.

37:40.341 --> 37:43.670
- I do. I wanna...
- We try, you sleep on the couch.

37:44.345 --> 37:47.347
- That's a bad thing to throw in my face.
- You don't wanna go anywhere.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.850
That's why all the same shit
is gonna keep happening to you,

37:49.851 --> 37:51.560
- because you want it to.
- Is that why?

37:51.561 --> 37:53.896
Yes, and also because
you're an asshole

37:53.897 --> 37:56.774
who sleeps with other people's women.
Let's not forget that.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.984
You're being pretty kind
to yourself now, aren't you?

37:58.985 --> 38:02.485
- Whose couch are you on tonight?
- I told you. Al Cody's. You don't listen.

38:03.031 --> 38:06.241
You just spout vitriol.

38:06.242 --> 38:08.444
Keep an eye on my shit.

38:20.256 --> 38:21.590
Hey.

38:21.591 --> 38:25.011
Hey. Hey, hey.

38:32.227 --> 38:36.227
Oh, goddamn it.
I am one lucky bastard.

38:37.357 --> 38:39.309
Thanks for suggesting this place.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.444
Poor thing couldn't have eaten
since yesterday.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.446
It's a damn house cat.
There you go.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.574
You know its name?
I can't remember his name.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.409
I don't know its name.

38:49.410 --> 38:51.078
I don't hang out with the Gorfeins.

38:51.079 --> 38:53.407
Oh, good kitty.
Jesus, thank God.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.250
Well, where were we?

38:56.251 --> 39:00.126
You were calling me a careerist,
and I was calling you a loser.

39:00.713 --> 39:02.673
Right, well,
those are your categories.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.341
No, those are your categories.

39:04.342 --> 39:05.884
You know, in my experience,

39:05.885 --> 39:08.095
the world's divided
into two kinds of people.

39:08.096 --> 39:10.305
Those who divide the world
into two kinds of people...

39:10.306 --> 39:11.553
And losers?

39:15.228 --> 39:17.771
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:17.772 --> 39:20.482
Uh, can you bring this up for me?
This ain't a spot.

39:20.483 --> 39:23.402
- I just brought some stuff from home.
- Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

39:23.403 --> 39:25.863
Hey, you don't need to... Meow.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.407
You don't need to crash for more
than a couple days, do you?

39:28.408 --> 39:30.576
My girlfriend's coming down
from Boston on Tuesday.

39:30.577 --> 39:34.079
Uh... Yeah, no, that's... Yeah,
it's fine. That's okay. Yeah, thanks.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.164
You don't wanna go to Chicago,
do you?

39:36.165 --> 39:39.501
- Why would I wanna go to Chicago?
- Yeah. Ha, ha.

39:39.502 --> 39:42.462
This car's going to Chicago Tuesday.
A friend of mine is taking someone

39:42.463 --> 39:45.173
to a gig and they're looking
for someone to help pay for gas.

39:45.174 --> 39:46.591
I prefer New York.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.011
Who's "Arthur Milgram"?

39:49.012 --> 39:50.596
Oh, that's me.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.016
I'm gonna change it legally,
at some point.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.196
Mr. Davis?

40:08.907 --> 40:10.991
No, no, no, she
won't want me with her.

40:10.992 --> 40:12.993
Oh, okay. Well, she should
have a friend though.

40:12.994 --> 40:14.328
Someone who can help her home.

40:14.329 --> 40:17.456
- Okay, I'll let her know.
- It'll have to be on a Saturday.

40:17.457 --> 40:19.207
Hey, I could do it this Saturday.

40:19.208 --> 40:22.878
Okay. I'll, uh, pay you now
since I won't see you. Cash.

40:22.879 --> 40:25.457
Oh! No, no, no. Heh.

40:25.590 --> 40:28.008
- No charge.
- Huh?

40:28.009 --> 40:30.632
You know, from last time.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.680
From last time?
You mean Diane?

40:33.681 --> 40:36.433
Yeah, I didn't have a number
or an address for you.

40:36.434 --> 40:39.102
- Where do you live anyway?
- Wait, what?

40:39.103 --> 40:41.438
- I didn't have a...
- Why...?

40:41.439 --> 40:44.267
- Why is there no charge this time?
- Huh?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.276
Why...?

40:46.277 --> 40:48.570
Well, you know.

40:48.571 --> 40:50.864
Well, no, I don't know, man.
You working pro bono now?

40:50.865 --> 40:53.568
Well, no, since it didn't
happen last time.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.825
What didn't happen?

40:59.415 --> 41:01.288
Diane didn't tell you?

41:03.461 --> 41:07.006
Diane did not terminate
the pregnancy.

41:08.341 --> 41:11.511
She came in to tell me she decided

41:12.011 --> 41:13.470
to go to term.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.799
She didn't tell you?

41:16.599 --> 41:18.676
Uh, no.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.728
She, uh...

41:21.729 --> 41:24.690
Geez, she asked me to refer her
to a doctor in Akron.

41:24.691 --> 41:27.895
- In Akron?
- To deliver the, uh...

41:29.862 --> 41:33.115
No, I knew she was, uh, going
to Akron. She's from Akron.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.909
Yes.

41:35.118 --> 41:38.492
- I'm sorry, I thought...
- Her parents are in Akron.

41:42.583 --> 41:44.876
The kid would be about 2 now?

41:44.877 --> 41:47.170
Yeah, I guess.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.623
Yes.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.342
I'm sorry, I didn't know how
to get the money back to you.

41:52.343 --> 41:54.966
I never see you at
the hoots anymore.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.329
- Oh, there's the cat.
- Yeah.

42:20.204 --> 42:23.540
Home from the hill.
Hey, Llewyn, welcome. Come on in.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.126
Lillian's in the kitchen.
She's making her famous moussaka.

42:26.127 --> 42:28.295
No, I can't barge in for dinner.
I just wanted to...

42:28.296 --> 42:31.465
- No, no. Come on. One more person?
- No, no, no. No, I can't.

42:31.466 --> 42:34.134
Moussaka? Come on.

42:34.135 --> 42:37.805
Do you know, uh...? You know
Marty Green and Janet Fung?

42:38.181 --> 42:40.140
Hello, nice to meet you.
Llewyn Davis.

42:40.141 --> 42:42.559
Oh, uh, Mitch and Lillian's, uh,
folk song friend.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.769
You crashing with us?

42:43.770 --> 42:46.229
Oh, no, no, no.
I hadn't even planned on dinner.

42:46.230 --> 42:49.149
Llewyn's not an Upper West Side guy.
We only get to see him when...

42:49.150 --> 42:51.068
When I've rotated through
my Village friends.

42:51.069 --> 42:53.070
Yeah, we're the last resort.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.572
Marty's in my department.
And, uh, Joe's a musician.

42:55.573 --> 42:58.784
This is Joe Flom. He plays in
Musica Anticha with Lillian.

42:58.785 --> 43:01.703
Oh, hello. How you doing?

43:01.704 --> 43:04.123
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.458
What's your instrument?

43:06.459 --> 43:10.378
Well, anything with a keyboard.
I play celeste and harpsichord in MA.

43:10.379 --> 43:12.506
I'm a piano instructor most days.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.299
- Hey, bum a cigarette?
- Oh, sure.

43:14.300 --> 43:15.926
Glass of wine, Llewyn?

43:15.927 --> 43:17.674
- A little dago red?
- Yeah.

43:19.055 --> 43:20.555
I should've brought something.

43:20.556 --> 43:22.390
Hey, don't be silly,
you brought the cat.

43:22.391 --> 43:23.725
Yeah, right.

43:23.726 --> 43:25.724
You know, uh,

43:26.687 --> 43:30.023
I used to, uh, take piano lessons
when I was a kid

43:30.024 --> 43:32.773
from, uh, Mrs. Sieglestein.

43:33.778 --> 43:36.356
You don't know
Mrs. Sieglestein, do you?

43:36.656 --> 43:41.701
Very, very big calves,
orthopedic shoes,

43:41.702 --> 43:44.576
lives in Far Rockaway,
upstairs from the Kurlands?

43:46.541 --> 43:48.584
Does she play early music?

43:50.169 --> 43:51.920
Um...

43:51.921 --> 43:54.381
Harry James on the radio.

43:54.382 --> 43:57.005
On the piano, um,

43:59.011 --> 44:00.929
"Drink to Me Only with Thine Eyes."

44:01.139 --> 44:02.389
Uh-huh.

44:02.390 --> 44:03.765
She was not a swinger.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.101
Well, Harry James.

44:06.102 --> 44:09.431
Okay, yeah, well, her playing that
was pretty on the beat.

44:10.356 --> 44:12.729
He's adorable.

44:15.736 --> 44:17.779
- How old is he?
- Just turned 2 in April.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.156
He's with my mother now.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.991
Grandmas come in handy, right?

44:20.992 --> 44:23.076
- What's his name?
- Howie.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.453
He already calls him Howie.
It's Howard.

44:25.454 --> 44:27.281
Howie Greenfung.

44:27.790 --> 44:30.084
What? Like...?

44:30.209 --> 44:32.836
Like, "Green-fung"? Hyphenated?

44:32.837 --> 44:34.754
No, no, one word, Greenfung.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.628
Howard Greenfung.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.590
You're kidding, right?

44:40.761 --> 44:42.554
- No.
- Llewyn, why don't you...?

44:42.555 --> 44:43.972
Why don't you give us a song?

44:43.973 --> 44:46.349
Oh, yes, please. He's very good.

44:46.350 --> 44:47.726
- Joe should hear you.
- No.

44:47.727 --> 44:50.061
- And Marty and Janet.
- Of course.

44:50.062 --> 44:53.148
I'm getting my Silvertone. You get
to play it if and only if you sing.

44:53.149 --> 44:56.484
Right, yeah, okay, I can tell this is one
of those things where I keep saying no

44:56.485 --> 44:58.445
and you think I'm just asking you
to beg more.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.280
Yeah, that's right.

45:00.281 --> 45:02.240
Hey, look,
I'm not a trained poodle.

45:02.241 --> 45:06.036
I thought singing was a
joyous expression of the soul.

45:13.628 --> 45:15.580
Yeah.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.960
All right. Um...

45:22.094 --> 45:24.217
This is...

45:25.181 --> 45:27.099
This one's early.
Joe should like it.

45:34.273 --> 45:38.360
<i>If I had wings</i>

45:38.361 --> 45:41.529
<i>Like Norah's dove</i>

45:41.530 --> 45:44.483
<i>I'd fly up the river</i>

45:45.201 --> 45:50.121
<i>To the one I love</i>

45:50.122 --> 45:54.584
<i>- Fare thee well
- Well</i>

45:54.585 --> 45:56.419
- Oh, honey...
- Oh, honey...

45:56.420 --> 45:58.129
- What are you doing?
- What?

45:58.130 --> 45:59.839
What is that?
What are you doing?

45:59.840 --> 46:03.089
- Well, it's Mike's part.
- Don't do that.

46:03.803 --> 46:07.473
- It's Mike's part.
- I know what it is. Don't do that.

46:14.063 --> 46:16.606
Oh, you know what?
This is bullshit.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.900
I'm sorry, this is...
I don't do this, okay?

46:18.901 --> 46:22.988
I do this for a living. It's not a...
it's not a fucking parlor game.

46:22.989 --> 46:25.156
Llewyn, please,
that's unfair to Lillian.

46:25.157 --> 46:27.242
This is bullshit.
I don't ask you over for dinner

46:27.243 --> 46:30.245
and then suggest you give a lecture
on the peoples of Mesoamerica.

46:30.246 --> 46:32.039
Or whatever your
pre-Columbian shit is.

46:32.957 --> 46:35.750
This is my job. This is how
I pay the fucking rent.

46:35.751 --> 46:37.419
Llewyn, that's not...

46:37.420 --> 46:38.878
This is a loving home.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.839
I'm a fucking professional.
And you know what?

46:40.840 --> 46:42.417
- Fuck Mike's part!
- Ah!

46:42.633 --> 46:45.135
- It's okay, Lillian.
- This is just a... This is...

46:45.136 --> 46:48.805
I can't stay in this room.
I can't stay in this room.

46:53.602 --> 46:54.936
Well, she...

46:54.937 --> 46:58.016
She doesn't have to leave.
I'm leaving, obviously.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.478
Sorry I fucked up your evening.

47:01.861 --> 47:04.109
- Thank you for the moussaka.
- Aah!

47:08.200 --> 47:11.324
This is not our cat.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.331
What? Of course that's your cat.

47:14.332 --> 47:17.035
- Oh, my God.
- It's not even male.

47:17.335 --> 47:20.295
Where's its scrotum, Llewyn?

47:20.296 --> 47:23.796
- Wh... it's...
- Where's its scrotum?

47:51.285 --> 47:52.532
My stuff.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.646
Hello.

48:28.697 --> 48:31.320
Yeah, hey.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.814
What's this?

49:02.815 --> 49:04.562
It's my guitar.

49:04.984 --> 49:08.278
Sure, move in. Don't mind me.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.197
Make yourself at home.

49:12.283 --> 49:15.407
What are you, a flamenco dancer?

49:18.164 --> 49:20.787
What's your name? Pablo?

49:21.125 --> 49:22.372
Llewyn Davis.

49:23.419 --> 49:26.588
I am Roland Turner.

49:26.589 --> 49:29.759
This is my valet, Johnny Five.

49:32.052 --> 49:34.630
Johnny Five.

49:36.390 --> 49:39.684
And that was the last time
I was in Murfreesboro.

49:39.685 --> 49:42.437
Gave me to understand
I would not be welcome back.

49:42.438 --> 49:45.148
I said, "That's okay, brother.
I might have managed on my own

49:45.149 --> 49:50.150
not to make it back to your
little flyspeck horseshit town."

49:50.404 --> 49:52.106
What the N stand for?

49:53.324 --> 49:56.576
- What?
- What's the N stand for?

49:56.577 --> 49:59.204
- Lou N. Davis.
- "Llewyn."

49:59.205 --> 50:02.124
Llewyn, L-L-E-W-Y-N. It's Welsh.

50:02.458 --> 50:05.543
Well, it would have to be something,
stupid fucking name like that.

50:05.544 --> 50:07.629
- You don't look Welsh-
- My mother was Italian...

50:07.630 --> 50:08.963
Here, this would interest you.

50:08.964 --> 50:12.091
Johnny and I were in Seattle
playing the High Spot.

50:12.092 --> 50:13.301
Remember this, Johnny?

50:13.302 --> 50:17.555
And I became indisposed after eating
a toasted cheese sandwich,

50:17.556 --> 50:20.975
and found myself purging
from every orifice,

50:20.976 --> 50:22.936
one of them like a fire hose.

50:22.937 --> 50:25.606
I said to the manager:

50:26.148 --> 50:28.650
"What do you call that thing
I just ate?"

50:28.651 --> 50:32.237
He said, "Welsh rarebit."

50:32.238 --> 50:36.032
I says, "Okay, does everything
from Wales make you shit yourself,

50:36.033 --> 50:37.576
or just this piece of toast?"

50:37.868 --> 50:40.411
He said... Holy Jesus.
What is that thing?

50:40.412 --> 50:43.122
It's... It's my cat.
Well, it's not my cat, it's...

50:43.123 --> 50:45.083
Grown man with a cat.

50:45.084 --> 50:47.460
- Is that part of your act?
- No.

50:47.461 --> 50:50.171
- What'd you say you played?
- Folk songs.

50:50.172 --> 50:53.925
Folk songs. Thought you said
you were a musician.

50:53.926 --> 50:56.970
Folk singer with a cat.
You queer?

50:57.263 --> 51:00.431
L... It's not my cat.
I just didn't know what to do with it.

51:00.432 --> 51:03.726
Really? So did you bring
your dick along too?

51:03.727 --> 51:06.104
Johnny, hold up.

51:06.105 --> 51:08.558
There's a service station.

51:09.275 --> 51:11.898
Your turn to pay for gas, Elwin.

51:30.588 --> 51:32.040
He still in there?

52:06.540 --> 52:08.287
You're a friend of Al's?

52:10.002 --> 52:11.920
Yeah.

52:30.773 --> 52:34.359
<i>When I go back
Baltimore</i>

52:34.360 --> 52:37.695
<i>Need no carpet on my floor</i>

52:37.696 --> 52:40.399
<i>Come along and follow me</i>

52:40.699 --> 52:44.403
<i>We'll go down to Galilee</i>

52:44.703 --> 52:46.371
Everybody.

52:46.372 --> 52:49.499
<i>Green, green, rocky road</i>

52:49.500 --> 52:50.708
Yeah.

52:50.709 --> 52:52.877
<i>Promenade in green</i>

52:52.878 --> 52:54.796
Mm-hm.

52:54.797 --> 52:58.966
<i>Tell me who you love
Tell me who you love</i>

52:58.967 --> 53:00.760
Nice.

53:14.316 --> 53:18.111
There was a sign that said,
"No massé shots, no coins on cloth."

53:18.112 --> 53:22.949
I said, "Am I allowed to bank the ball
off the cushions or is that too fancy?"

53:22.950 --> 53:26.953
The guy says, "You're a hustler."
I say, "You're a fucking idiot.

53:26.954 --> 53:29.622
A hustler pretends
he's out of his depth.

53:29.623 --> 53:32.625
I'm telling you I'm an adept.
Maybe you're the hustler

53:32.626 --> 53:36.456
pretending to be a lunkhead.
Got me fooled."

53:37.131 --> 53:40.007
"No massé shots, no
coins on cloth."

53:40.008 --> 53:43.010
Don't give me rules.
You play what you play.

53:43.011 --> 53:46.639
Well, you don't, but in jazz,
you know, we play all the notes.

53:46.640 --> 53:51.728
Twelve notes in a scale, dipshit,
not three chords on a ukulele.

53:51.729 --> 53:55.606
<i>G, G, C, G</i>

53:55.607 --> 53:59.152
<i>C, D, G</i>

53:59.153 --> 54:02.448
Well, if you make a living at it,
more power to you.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.824
Solo act?

54:04.825 --> 54:07.243
- Yeah, now.
- Now?

54:07.244 --> 54:09.620
Used to, what, work with the cat?

54:09.621 --> 54:12.790
Every time you play a C major,
he'd puke a hair ball?

54:12.791 --> 54:14.584
I used to have a partner.

54:14.585 --> 54:16.708
What happened?

54:17.337 --> 54:20.837
He threw himself off
the George Washington Bridge.

54:22.718 --> 54:24.343
Well, shit, I don't blame him.

54:24.344 --> 54:27.972
I couldn't take it either, having to play
"Jimmy Cracked Corn" every night.

54:27.973 --> 54:30.933
Oh, pardon me for saying so, that's
pretty fucking stupid, isn't it?

54:30.934 --> 54:33.060
George Washington Bridge?

54:33.061 --> 54:37.023
You throw yourself off
the Brooklyn Bridge, traditionally.

54:37.024 --> 54:38.983
George Washington Bridge?

54:38.984 --> 54:40.860
Who does that?

54:40.861 --> 54:43.359
What was he, a dumbbell?

54:44.698 --> 54:46.696
Not really.

54:47.284 --> 54:49.202
And that's when
you picked up the cat?

54:49.328 --> 54:52.622
Here, Cowboy Chords,
this would interest you.

54:52.623 --> 54:55.082
There's this act I saw
in Montreux, Switzerland.

54:55.083 --> 54:58.503
- A bass, a piano and a sound tree...
- Hey, Mr. Turner, I'm wondering.

54:58.587 --> 55:00.254
- Huh?
- Would that cane

55:00.255 --> 55:01.923
fit all the way up your ass

55:01.924 --> 55:04.468
or would a little bit
stay sticking out?

55:08.055 --> 55:10.178
Okay.

55:10.974 --> 55:13.051
Okay.

55:13.727 --> 55:16.521
Except threats and intimidation
won't work with me.

55:16.522 --> 55:18.898
You wanna know why?
This would interest you.

55:18.899 --> 55:20.775
I studied Santeria

55:20.776 --> 55:24.153
and certain other things that squares
like you would call the black arts

55:24.154 --> 55:27.865
due to lack of understanding,
from Chano Pozo in New Orleans.

55:27.866 --> 55:29.242
You say you'll mess me up?

55:29.243 --> 55:31.536
I don't have to make
those childish threats.

55:31.537 --> 55:34.372
I do my thing, and one day
you wake up wondering:

55:34.373 --> 55:36.958
"Why do I have this
pain in my side?"

55:36.959 --> 55:40.044
Or maybe it won't
even be that specific.

55:40.045 --> 55:42.797
Maybe it's, "Why is
nothing going right for me?

55:42.798 --> 55:46.300
My life is a big bowl of shit.

55:46.301 --> 55:50.176
I don't remember making
this big bowl of shit."

55:51.765 --> 55:55.768
Meantime, Roland Turner
is a thousand miles away,

55:55.769 --> 55:58.813
laughing his ass off.

56:00.190 --> 56:02.017
Think about that, Elwin.

56:02.234 --> 56:06.064
In this car,
bad manners won't work.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.167
Bum a cigarette?

56:20.627 --> 56:22.625
I'm out.

56:49.114 --> 56:52.193
"Clean Asshole Poems,"

56:52.326 --> 56:54.870
Orlovsky.

56:57.372 --> 56:59.290
Then,

56:59.416 --> 57:01.493
acted.

57:04.338 --> 57:06.336
<i>The Brig.</i>

57:10.010 --> 57:12.678
Three weeks on that show.

57:12.679 --> 57:14.847
Could've been more.

57:16.224 --> 57:18.722
Cops closed it.

57:22.856 --> 57:24.729
How come?

57:27.444 --> 57:30.022
Long story.

57:43.085 --> 57:46.337
<i>"'More, more, more, 'cried the bed.</i>

57:46.338 --> 57:48.916
<i>'Talk to me more.'</i>

57:48.924 --> 57:52.628
<i>Oh, bed that faked
The weight of the world.</i>

57:53.220 --> 57:56.344
<i>All the lost dreams laid on you.</i>

57:56.640 --> 57:59.350
<i>Oh, bed that grows no hair.</i>

57:59.351 --> 58:01.770
<i>That cannot be fucked,</i>

58:02.062 --> 58:04.356
<i>or can be fucked.</i>

58:05.440 --> 58:09.486
<i>Oh, bed crumbs of all ages
Spilled on you.</i>

58:11.697 --> 58:13.820
<i>Oh, bed.</i>

58:17.494 --> 58:19.537
Yes.

58:23.500 --> 58:25.668
Well...

58:29.881 --> 58:31.833
Excuse me.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.443
Hi.

58:50.444 --> 58:52.194
How far are we from Chicago?

58:52.195 --> 58:55.899
About three hours,
a little more with the weather.

59:58.678 --> 01:00:01.006
Should I go call an ambulance?

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:02.340
No, he's all right.

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:05.727
Grab his sticks.

01:01:03.577 --> 01:01:05.035
What are you doing?

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:07.534
- I'm just, uh...
- You can't stop here.

01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:10.833
I just pulled over to
rest a little bit.

01:01:12.043 --> 01:01:13.586
You inebriated?

01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:16.085
- He's not drunk.
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:01:16.965 --> 01:01:19.049
You, get out of the car.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.924
- Me?
- You. Out of the car.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.434
Come here, I want you to walk...

01:01:28.435 --> 01:01:31.388
- Hands off the merchandise.
- Don't play games, kid.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.899
Son of a bitch.

01:01:36.651 --> 01:01:39.400
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:01:40.488 --> 01:01:43.487
I've been in your jails.
That's not gonna work.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.790
Shit.

01:03:59.044 --> 01:04:00.962
Oh, sh...

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:28.022
Number two.

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:33.286
- More coffee?
- Yeah.

01:05:04.150 --> 01:05:09.072
We're switching over.
Could you pay the ticket?

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:27.249
What train are you waiting for?

01:06:11.551 --> 01:06:13.469
Hello?

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:17.970
Hello?

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.764
Is Bud Grossman here?

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:22.845
Isn't in yet.

01:06:24.689 --> 01:06:26.940
Can I wait here?

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:30.896
Uh, sure. Maybe an hour.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:51.917
<i>Cocaine Runnin' all
around my brain</i>

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.609
Mr. Grossman.

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:14.030
Yeah?

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:17.776
I, uh... I'm Llewyn Davis.

01:07:19.827 --> 01:07:21.620
Uh-huh.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.451
- I'm sorry, do you know me?
- No.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:29.169
Um, Mel Novikoff sent you my
record about a month ago.

01:07:29.170 --> 01:07:31.672
<i>- Inside Llewyn Davis.</i>
- Oh, you're with Mel.

01:07:31.673 --> 01:07:36.426
Yeah, yeah, I was, uh, just in Chicago,
just, uh... Just passing through.

01:07:36.427 --> 01:07:38.174
Um...

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:41.557
- You like the record?
- Don't know. I didn't get it.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:45.599
Well, um,

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.814
here it is. Uh, it's...

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.562
This is it anyway, it's...

01:07:56.072 --> 01:07:57.694
That'll be $5.

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:01.907
I was joking.

01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:05.073
Uh-huh.

01:08:06.207 --> 01:08:08.041
Well, yeah, I'm, um...

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:10.377
I'm interested in gigging here,

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:13.797
but, um, maybe also
in obtaining management.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:15.507
Uh-huh.

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:17.301
You getting any money out of Mel?

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:20.551
- Not...
- Yeah, I bet.

01:08:23.057 --> 01:08:25.309
Okay, let's hear something.

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:26.768
You don't wanna hear the record?

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:29.145
Why should I? You're here.
Play me something.

01:08:29.147 --> 01:08:30.394
Play me something from

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.227

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:41.617
Not here.

01:09:18.571 --> 01:09:20.444
Okay.

<i>Will you do one thing for me?</i>

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:25.721
<i>Will you open my right side</i>

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:30.644
<i>And find my baby?</i>

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:35.690
<i>And find my baby?</i>

Okay.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:15.956
Okay. So that's it?

01:12:16.249 --> 01:12:18.875
You're okay. You're not green.

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:21.920
But I don't have what,
say, Troy Nelson has?

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:23.714
You know Troy?

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.750
Good kid.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.627
He's a good kid.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:29.428
Yeah.

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:31.676
He connects with people.

01:12:33.474 --> 01:12:37.269
Look, I'm putting together a trio.
Two guys and a girl singer.

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:38.687
You're no front guy,

01:12:38.688 --> 01:12:40.897
but if you can cut that
down to a goatee,

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.399
and stay out of the sun,

01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.860
we might see how your voice works
with the other two.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.736
You comfortable with harmonies?

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.280
No.

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:51.408
Yes. But, um, no.

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:53.326
No, I had a partner.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:56.155
Uh-huh. Well, that makes sense.

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:58.206
MY Suggestion?

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.786
Get back together.

01:13:05.756 --> 01:13:07.924
That's good advice.

01:13:08.759 --> 01:13:11.087
Thank you, Mr. Grossman.

01:13:27.862 --> 01:13:29.946
- Where you going?
- New York.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:32.991
Man, that's great. I'm going home
to New Jersey. I've not slept.

01:13:32.992 --> 01:13:34.910
- You drive, right?
- Yeah.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:36.786
Well, as long as you drive
and let me sleep,

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.663
we can do it all the way, man.

01:15:07.586 --> 01:15:09.083
Oh, sh...

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:23.468
So, uh, can I ship out?

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:26.224
No, you cannot.

01:17:26.225 --> 01:17:29.679
- Why?
- You're not on the roster.

01:17:30.396 --> 01:17:32.897
Okay. Well, can you put
me on the roster?

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:34.399
No, I cannot.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.276
- Why?
- Why you think?

01:17:36.277 --> 01:17:38.946
I don't know.
Because I'm a Communist.

01:17:39.029 --> 01:17:40.606
- Shachtmanite?
- What?

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:43.199
No, you ain't that.
You ain't, uh...

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:45.076
- You ain't current.
- I'm not current?

01:17:45.077 --> 01:17:47.662
- That's another way of putting it.
- Is that a nautical term?

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.372
You ain't current on your dues.

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:52.250
You pay your dues, arrears,
148 bucks,

01:17:52.251 --> 01:17:55.003
you go back on the roster
and I can ship you out.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.630
<i>There's a post on The Maid
of the Gate, Seaman First Class.</i>

01:18:00.009 --> 01:18:03.469
The money, what I owe, can't they just
take it out of, whatever, the first week?

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.805
I can't run out on it.
I'm in your fucking sardine can.

01:18:05.806 --> 01:18:09.431
Yeah, they don't do that.
You gotta be current to ship out.

01:18:11.854 --> 01:18:13.772
Wow.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:18.569
I just make it.
I'm leaving naked, man.

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:22.322
- Clean start. Okay. Can I pay you?
- Mm-hm.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:24.782
Now, I will write you a receipt,

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:29.370
along with the, uh, pier, ship number,
and the time.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:31.539
Got your Masters Mate's
and Pilot's license, right?

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:34.334
- You ain't shipping out without that.
- Yeah, I got it.

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:36.044
There you go, Llewyn Davis.

01:18:36.045 --> 01:18:37.918
Hey, you're not Hugh
Davis's kid, are you?

01:18:39.423 --> 01:18:41.341
Why not?

01:18:56.523 --> 01:18:58.566
Hey...

01:19:09.078 --> 01:19:11.280
How's it going?

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.042
I'm taking off, Pop.

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:18.496
Won't see you for a while.

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:22.712
Shipping out.

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.807
Try something new.

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:34.053
I mean something old.

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.727
Okay.

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:54.870

Excuse me?

01:22:54.178 --> 01:22:57.552
Could I trouble you?
My father had, um...

01:22:58.015 --> 01:22:59.682
He needs to be cleaned.

01:23:01.101 --> 01:23:02.852
How is he?

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.896
He's great.

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:06.981
Good to see what I have
to look forward to.

01:23:06.982 --> 01:23:08.229
What?

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:10.318
- Llewyn.
- No, I'm not kidding.

01:23:10.319 --> 01:23:11.986
I got it all figured out now.

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:15.990
You put in some hard years, yeah,
but eventually you get to kick back,

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:19.452
your food's brought to you,
don't even have to get up to shit.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:22.705
- Llewyn, Danny's sitting right here.
- Oh, sorry.

01:23:22.706 --> 01:23:24.999
What's wrong with you?
Shame on you.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.960
I'm sorry. It was really good
to see him. It was great.

01:23:27.961 --> 01:23:30.414
- Where'd you put my file box?
- Huh?

01:23:30.589 --> 01:23:32.715
From the house,
where's my file box?

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.634
You told me to throw
everything out.

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:36.093
All the old shit, Joy.

01:23:36.094 --> 01:23:38.346
- Fuck, you threw out my file box?
- Llewyn.

01:23:38.347 --> 01:23:41.349
Yeah, no cursing. Except now I gotta
go back to the fucking union hall.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:43.601
It had my Masters Mate's
and Pilot's license in it.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:45.102
Jesus Christ, Joy.

01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:46.854
You told me to put
it out by the curb.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.147
It's what I did.

01:23:48.148 --> 01:23:50.358
I want you to leave.
Get out of here.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.606
Fuck.

01:23:53.529 --> 01:23:56.653
- Yeah, I'm a dick, right?
- That's right.

01:23:58.534 --> 01:24:01.285
Danny, your uncle's a bad man.

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:03.113
Okay.

01:24:08.001 --> 01:24:10.419
<i>- Hello?</i>
- It's Llewyn. Don't hang up.

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.130
I don't wanna stay. I just need
a place to dump my stuff. Please.

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:16.130
I'm tired of dragging it
all around with me.

01:24:16.426 --> 01:24:18.378
Please?

01:24:35.362 --> 01:24:38.114
- Where are you gonna stay?
- I don't know.

01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:39.323
It's only two nights.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:43.154
There must be someone in the
five boroughs who isn't pissed at me.

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.414
- How do you feel?
- Fine.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.662
Why?

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:50.752
So it went okay?

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:53.296
I'm doing it Saturday.

01:24:53.297 --> 01:24:56.674
Jesus, Llewyn,
you don't even fucking remember.

01:24:56.675 --> 01:25:00.595
Yeah, boy, I'm sorry.
I... I was away.

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:03.931
Well, it seemed like it was a long time,
but it was just a couple of days. Yeah.

01:25:03.932 --> 01:25:06.392
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
- Where were you?

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:08.436
In Chicago.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:09.767
Why?

01:25:12.190 --> 01:25:13.516
No. Nothing.

01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:17.438
Pappi will let you play tomorrow.

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:18.696
Pick up a couple bucks.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:20.698
No, he won't.
I was there less than a month ago.

01:25:20.699 --> 01:25:22.366
He will. I asked him.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:26.663
Wow. Thank you,
that was very nice of you,

01:25:27.122 --> 01:25:30.326
but I'm out. I'm done.

01:25:30.876 --> 01:25:33.711
- Going back to the Merchant Marine.
- What, that's it?

01:25:33.712 --> 01:25:35.630
This could be good for you
tomorrow.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.757
Playing the Gaslight
for the 400th time?

01:25:37.758 --> 01:25:39.175
For the fucking basket?

01:25:39.176 --> 01:25:41.802
Actually,
you'd have to split the basket.

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.721
- Heh.
- There's another act.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:45.806
But <i>The Times</i> is gonna be there.

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.554
Oh, <i>The Times.</i>

01:25:48.518 --> 01:25:50.061
I'm sorry.

01:25:50.395 --> 01:25:52.973
I'm sorry. Thanks for the thought,

01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.108
but it's not going anywhere.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:25:58.483
I'm tired.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:00.772
You're tired?

01:26:01.031 --> 01:26:04.576
Yeah, I'm so fucking tired.

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:08.371
I thought I just needed a
night's sleep, but it's...

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:11.074
It's more than that.

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:16.463
But thank you, for trying.

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.415
I love you.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:23.674
Come on.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.055
Are you shitting me?

01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:28.224
In what way, buddy?

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:31.227
Eighty-five dollars?
To replace a license?

01:26:31.228 --> 01:26:33.354
You don't throw out the license.

01:26:33.355 --> 01:26:35.564
That's the one thing you keep.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:37.312
I can't... Where am I gonna...?

01:26:38.151 --> 01:26:40.319
Fuck.

01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:43.114
All right, well, let me get
this money back then.

01:26:43.907 --> 01:26:45.529
I got...

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:48.911
I kept this fucking thing.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:52.415
I just paid my dues this morning,
148 bucks. There's the receipt.

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:54.118
You don't...

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:57.166
We don't pay dues back.
What are you, nuts?

01:26:58.463 --> 01:27:00.881
I just paid it this morning.
That was four hours ago.

01:27:00.882 --> 01:27:02.591
- Yeah.
- Come on, you're telling me...

01:27:02.592 --> 01:27:05.219
I can't crew the ship,
and I can't get this money back?

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.680
This was money
you owed your union.

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:10.430
You Hugh Davis's kid?

01:27:10.642 --> 01:27:12.476
- Yeah.
- How's he doing?

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:15.104
He's fucking great. Matter of fact,
he's been asking after you.

01:27:15.105 --> 01:27:19.358
<i>A hungry feelin'</i>

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:23.904
<i>Came o'er me stealin'</i>

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:28.701
<i>And the mice were squealin'</i>

01:27:28.702 --> 01:27:32.621
<i>In my prison cell</i>

01:27:32.622 --> 01:27:37.585
<i>And the auld triangle</i>

01:27:37.586 --> 01:27:42.798
<i>Went jingle jangle</i>

01:27:42.799 --> 01:27:48.387
<i>All along the banks</i>

01:27:48.388 --> 01:27:54.268
<i>Of the Royal Canal</i>

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:58.522
<i>To begin the morning</i>

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:02.526
<i>A screw was bawlin'</i>

01:28:02.527 --> 01:28:04.236
<i>Get up...</i>

01:28:04.237 --> 01:28:06.064
Hey.

01:28:06.698 --> 01:28:09.151
We're gonna hear you tomorrow.

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:12.238
Yeah, I guess you are.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.949
Well, you're welcome.

01:28:18.376 --> 01:28:20.002
What do you think of these guys?

01:28:20.003 --> 01:28:24.048
<i>All along the banks</i>

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:28.803
<i>Of the Royal Canal</i>

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.221
I like the sweaters.

01:28:30.222 --> 01:28:33.676
<i>The lads were sleepin'</i>

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:38.730
You know, you wouldn't
fucking believe the rent here.

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:42.233
This folk shit, I don't know.

01:28:43.109 --> 01:28:45.694
Jim and Jean,
we get a good crowd.

01:28:45.695 --> 01:28:47.442
You know why, Llewyn?

01:28:47.531 --> 01:28:49.156
Lot of these guys,

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:52.201
a lot them come in here
catch the act,

01:28:52.494 --> 01:28:54.453
because they wanna fuck Jean.

01:28:54.454 --> 01:28:56.330
That's why they come in.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:59.166
And some of them,
some of these guys, Llewyn,

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.961
they come in here
because they wanna fuck Jim.

01:29:04.381 --> 01:29:06.799
They wanna fuck Jim.

01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:08.717
Know what I mean?

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:11.887
- You mean they wanna fuck Jim.
- Exactly.

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:14.307
Exactly.

01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:18.770
Well, me,

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:21.393
I've only fucked Jean.

01:29:21.898 --> 01:29:24.900
<i>All along the banks</i>

01:29:24.901 --> 01:29:26.227
What?

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:27.987
Oh, yeah.

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:30.361
Oh, yeah. You know.

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:33.409
If you wanna play the Gaslight...

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:37.246
Thanks.
Ladies and gentlemen, thanks.

01:29:37.247 --> 01:29:40.416
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Pappi Corsicato.

01:29:40.417 --> 01:29:43.836
Please give a great big
welcome to Elizabeth Hobby

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:46.790
from Elinora in Arkansas.

01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:53.596
Thank you.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:29:53.597 --> 01:29:55.264
Thank you. You're so nice.

01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:57.182
This is my first show in New York.

01:29:57.183 --> 01:30:00.011
How'd you get the gig, Betty?

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:03.348
Um, I'm gonna do this song.

01:30:03.607 --> 01:30:06.317
It's like a lot of the songs I do.

01:30:06.318 --> 01:30:08.360
It's one I grew up with.

01:30:08.361 --> 01:30:11.363
Ha, ha. Come on, Llewyn.
Give me a little credit.

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:16.744
<i>I'm a-goin' away
To leave you, love</i>

01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:22.167
<i>I'm going far over the sea</i>

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:28.047
<i>But I'll return to you someday</i>

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:29.256
<i>So I go 10,000 miles</i>

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:32.631
- Where's your hay bale?
- Shh!

01:30:33.803 --> 01:30:35.512
<i>The storms are on</i>

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:37.681
Huh? Where's your corncob pipe?

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:39.725
<i>The ocean</i>

01:30:39.726 --> 01:30:41.310
Are you wearing gingham panties?

01:30:41.311 --> 01:30:42.978
Shh!

01:30:42.979 --> 01:30:44.351
Huh?

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:47.942
Fuck you, you fucking phony.
Come on, show us your panties.

01:30:47.943 --> 01:30:49.818
- Shut up.
- Show us your panties, Betty.

01:30:49.819 --> 01:30:51.153
- That's enough.
- Fine.

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.821
Oh, God, I hate fucking folk music.

01:30:52.822 --> 01:30:55.449
- Okay, Eddie. We might need Florio.
- I fucking hate folk music.

01:30:55.450 --> 01:30:57.948
Fuck Florio. Fuck you, Pappi.

01:31:04.250 --> 01:31:06.460
The show is bullshit.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:09.255
Four micks and Grandma Moses.

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:28.357
Llewyn. Come on in.

01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:31.193
Lillian's making her famous
tabbouleh salad.

01:31:31.194 --> 01:31:33.237
Oh, Mitch,
I really appreciate this.

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:36.407
After last time, I just can't
tell you how sorry I am.

01:31:36.408 --> 01:31:38.033
Oh, forget it.

01:31:38.034 --> 01:31:42.037
We all get a little emotional over Mike.
It comes out in different ways.

01:31:42.038 --> 01:31:44.665
He had such life, you know?
Such a talent.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:47.459
It's a big hole. A big hole.

01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.295
- How long will you be with us?
- Just a day or two, if that's okay.

01:31:50.296 --> 01:31:52.756
- Just until I can figure out the next...
- Sure, yeah.

01:31:52.757 --> 01:31:54.466
Do you know Arlen
and Dodi Gamble?

01:31:54.467 --> 01:31:56.635
This is Llewyn Davis,
our folk-singer friend.

01:31:56.636 --> 01:31:58.383
You're Jim and Jean's friend.

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:00.514
Uh, sort of.

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:03.142
Jim played us a pressing of that record,
"Please, Mr. Kennedy."

01:32:03.143 --> 01:32:04.768
- It was hysterical.
- So funny.

01:32:04.769 --> 01:32:06.228
That's gonna be a hit, man.

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:08.480
Royalties on that?
Whoa, Nelly.

01:32:08.481 --> 01:32:11.480
I wish I was in your business.
I mean, one hit could fix you up.

01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:15.195
- Uh, yeah...
- Llewyn.

01:32:15.196 --> 01:32:17.990
- Lillian...
- I am so sorry I upset you.

01:32:17.991 --> 01:32:22.286
No, no, no.
You're apologizing to me?

01:32:22.287 --> 01:32:23.495
- Yeah.
- No.

01:32:23.496 --> 01:32:24.705
Holy shit.

01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:27.291
- On! Heh.
- Oh.

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:29.710
Oh, that's... That's good.
You got a new cat.

01:32:29.711 --> 01:32:31.211
- No.
- No, he came home.

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:32.421
Found his way back.

01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:35.090
The doorman heard something
scratching yesterday morning.

01:32:35.091 --> 01:32:37.468
- Early morning, the wee hours.
- Yeah, see?

01:32:37.469 --> 01:32:39.303
It's Ulysses.

01:32:39.304 --> 01:32:43.008
- It's... Ulysses?
- Ulysses.

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:45.552
That's its name?

01:33:18.384 --> 01:33:20.382
Hello?

01:34:01.302 --> 01:34:05.348
<i>And I'll be dead and gone</i>

01:34:06.391 --> 01:34:09.640
<i>I wouldn't mind the hanging</i>

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:14.439
<i>But the laying in the grave's so long
Poor boy</i>

01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.692
<i>I've been all around this world</i>

01:34:34.210 --> 01:34:36.128
You probably heard
that one before.

01:34:37.297 --> 01:34:41.172
If it was never new, and it never
gets old, then it's a folk song.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:44.762
All right, one more before I go.

01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:58.775
<i>If I had wings</i>

01:34:58.776 --> 01:35:01.778
<i>Like Norah's dove</i>

01:35:01.779 --> 01:35:05.407
<i>I'd fly up the river</i>

01:35:05.408 --> 01:35:09.703
<i>To the one I love</i>

01:35:09.704 --> 01:35:13.665
<i>Fare thee well</i>

01:35:13.666 --> 01:35:16.915
<i>Oh, honey</i>

01:35:18.171 --> 01:35:22.877
<i>Fare thee well</i>

01:35:26.888 --> 01:35:30.432
<i>Early one morning</i>

01:35:30.433 --> 01:35:32.681
<i>Drizzling rain</i>

01:35:33.645 --> 01:35:36.355
<i>And in my heart</i>

01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:40.686
<i>I felt an achin' pain</i>

01:35:41.361 --> 01:35:44.988
<i>Fare thee well</i>

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:48.318
<i>Oh, honey</i>

01:35:49.577 --> 01:35:54.533
<i>Fare thee well</i>

01:35:58.253 --> 01:36:01.463
<i>One of these mornings</i>

01:36:01.464 --> 01:36:04.633
<i>It won't be long</i>

01:36:04.634 --> 01:36:07.970
<i>You'll call my name</i>

01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:12.432
<i>And I'll be gone</i>

01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:16.186
<i>Fare thee well</i>

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:19.812
<i>Oh, honey</i>

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:25.905
<i>Fare, fare thee well</i>

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:32.327
<i>If I had wings</i>

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:35.539
<i>Like Norah's dove</i>

01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:38.750
<i>I'd fly up the river</i>

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:42.421
<i>To the one I love</i>

01:36:42.422 --> 01:36:46.593
<i>Oh, fare thee well</i>

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:49.796
<i>Oh, honey</i>

01:36:51.431 --> 01:36:57.513
<i>Fare thee well</i>

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.776
That's what I got.

01:37:12.618 --> 01:37:15.954
- You and Mikey used to do that song.
- Yeah.

01:37:15.955 --> 01:37:18.582
Boy, you were some
mess last night.

01:37:18.583 --> 01:37:20.660
Yeah, sorry, Pappi.
I'm an asshole.

01:37:20.918 --> 01:37:22.794
I don't give a shit.

01:37:22.795 --> 01:37:26.131
- Your friend is out back.
- My friend?

01:37:26.132 --> 01:37:29.757
Said he was a friend of yours.
Guy in a suit.

01:37:30.887 --> 01:37:36.892
<i>Oh, it's fare thee well
My darling true</i>

01:37:36.893 --> 01:37:41.314
<i>I'm leaving in the first hour
Of the morn</i>

01:37:49.906 --> 01:37:51.949
You a funny boy, huh?

01:37:53.659 --> 01:37:55.236
What?

01:37:55.995 --> 01:37:59.206
Had to open your big mouth.

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:01.910
That's what I do for a living.

01:38:03.211 --> 01:38:07.041
What you do.
Make fun of folks up there?

01:38:08.716 --> 01:38:13.345
You sit there in the audience
last night, yelling your crap.

01:38:13.346 --> 01:38:15.514
You yell stuff, man. It's a show.

01:38:16.474 --> 01:38:18.725
It wasn't your show.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:21.554
It's not the opera, jackass.
It's a fucking basket hou...

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:25.812
We're leaving this fucking cesspool.
You can have it.

01:38:26.401 --> 01:38:28.899
What you do.

01:38:32.657 --> 01:38:36.737
- My wife up there trying to sing.
- Unh.
