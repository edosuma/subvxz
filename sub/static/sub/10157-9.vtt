00:05.799 --> 00:07.967
And, uh, remember, Kristen...

00:08.051 --> 00:10.011
you're not just gaining a husband,

00:10.094 --> 00:14.140
you're also getting a beer cap collection
from over 20 years.

00:15.517 --> 00:20.647
But, uh, if I can be serious for a moment,
uh, Kristen, Dennis, uh...

00:20.730 --> 00:23.733
I just wanna say you're one
of those couples that give me hope.

00:23.817 --> 00:28.572
'Cause you make me realize that, um,
people really are meant for each other,

00:28.655 --> 00:31.490

00:31.575 --> 00:32.576
Aw...

00:32.659 --> 00:33.702
Let's hear it for Dennis and Kristen, huh?

00:39.498 --> 00:40.667
Hello?

00:40.750 --> 00:42.711
I'm spinning out.
Can you talk?

00:42.794 --> 00:44.170
-What?
-I hope it's not too early.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.714
I... I assumed you'd be awake.

00:45.797 --> 00:48.675
Why the fuck would I be awake?
It's fucking 4:00 a.m.

00:48.758 --> 00:51.552
I think I left things in a really
weird place with Gus last night.

00:51.636 --> 00:54.222
I think I fucked it up.
His friends were there. They all hated me.

00:54.305 --> 00:57.601
There was this other girl there,
and I think I left it in a bad place,

00:57.684 --> 00:58.935
but I know
if I could just see him

00:59.018 --> 01:00.812
and I could talk to him,
then I could fix it.

01:01.730 --> 01:03.356
-Mickey.
-Yeah?

01:03.439 --> 01:05.942
This sounds exactly like the shit
you did with Leo.

01:06.025 --> 01:08.027
No, no, no, no. Please.
That was so different.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.822
I was in college and I was nuts.
This... no.

01:10.905 --> 01:14.283
That's why I called you,
to have you tell me if it was like that,

01:14.367 --> 01:18.246
but now hearing myself talk out loud,
I know it's totally different. Thank you.

01:22.751 --> 01:27.255

03:47.561 --> 03:51.065
I just... I'm like, uh...
chasing my own tail in this relationship.

03:51.149 --> 03:52.984
I don't know how
to make her happy.

03:53.067 --> 03:56.070
Dude... why the fuck
are you telling me all of this?

03:56.154 --> 03:59.532
-What--
-Like, really, like... what is this about?

03:59.615 --> 04:02.243
I don't know. I see other people
share their problems with you

04:02.326 --> 04:04.829
and it seems cathartic
for them, so...

04:04.913 --> 04:07.290
I've been noticing that, too.
I really don't know what that's about.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.417
I don't even understand.
I'm not a priest.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.794
I'm not even intuitive with people,

04:10.877 --> 04:12.921
so this whole situation
is really kind of baffling me.

04:14.213 --> 04:15.673
Hey, Kevin. Evan.

04:15.757 --> 04:18.051
Ooh, rhyming name buddies there.
Look at that.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.179
Anyway, we'll continue this later, man.
I appreciate it.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.932
- Is there a Devon around here?
- Silly, man.

04:24.015 --> 04:27.101
-What's got you so happy today?
-I don't know.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.563
-You fucked Heidi, didn't you?
-Shh. No. Come on.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.981
-Yes, you did.
-Kevin.

04:32.065 --> 04:33.983
-I'm gonna just tell you, man. Be careful.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:34.067 --> 04:36.652
Any chick with a headshot
is out of her mind.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.737
I worked with that chick
Jennifer Lawrence last summer.

04:38.822 --> 04:39.823
Mmm-hmm.

04:39.906 --> 04:42.826
Very clingy chick. She walked around
all day with a stuffed animal.

04:42.909 --> 04:45.870
Okay, well, relax. I got this handled.
It's all good, it's all good.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.872
Yeah. Hey, Wyatt.

04:47.956 --> 04:50.291
Hey, man.
How are things in the old writers' room?

04:50.374 --> 04:55.088
Great, man. Susan Cheryl just threw away
my story for episode 12, so...

04:55.171 --> 04:56.755
- fuckin' awesome.
- Mmm.

04:56.840 --> 04:58.716
Well, hang in there, buddy.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.593
Wish I could be there
in the trenches with ya.

05:01.260 --> 05:02.511
Whatever, dude.

05:03.679 --> 05:06.140
You got to really stop kissin' ass, man.
He's a dick.

05:06.224 --> 05:08.059
No, no, no.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.561
Deep down, he's, like, actually a real...
like, a really good guy.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.980
Big heart, you know?

05:12.063 --> 05:13.064
- Hey, Gus.
- Hmm?

05:13.147 --> 05:14.858
Did you fuck Heidi?

05:20.363 --> 05:22.698
So, what'd you think about last night?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.117
It was incredible.

05:24.200 --> 05:27.954
I mean, I never would have thought
to buy the burger from Wendy's

05:28.037 --> 05:30.123
and then the fries from McDonald's.

05:30.206 --> 05:32.791
Well, I'm kind of a big idea guy.

05:32.876 --> 05:34.668
Next time, we'll throw in a shake
from Jack in the Box.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.462
I call that Randy's Triple Dandy.

05:36.545 --> 05:39.090
It was very thoughtful of you
to take me out.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.760
Well, you seemed a little down,
so I thought we could have some fun.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.972
Yeah, I was kind of annoyed with Mickey.
I mean, don't you think that's rude?

05:46.055 --> 05:48.266
I was making a pie,
and then I dropped everything

05:48.349 --> 05:50.143
so I could go and rescue her
from that party.

05:50.226 --> 05:53.354
-What kind of pie?
-Fruits of the forest.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.273
That's super fucked up.

05:55.356 --> 05:57.441
--Oh, she's coming. I... I should go.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.567
All right, call me later.

05:58.651 --> 06:02.030
Okay, I will. Thank you so much
for helping me with the drought.

06:02.113 --> 06:03.864
Bring over some--

06:03.948 --> 06:06.700
-Hey! Hi, cutes.
-Hi!

06:06.784 --> 06:09.745
I'm so sorry about last night.

06:09.828 --> 06:14.333
I think I left right before you got there,
and then I came home and I just crashed.

06:15.459 --> 06:16.752
Why didn't you text me?

06:16.835 --> 06:21.215
My phone died, and I just...
I feel so bad about the whole night.

06:21.299 --> 06:23.842
I want you to know that I think of you
as more than a roommate.

06:23.927 --> 06:25.761
I think of you as a friend.

06:26.679 --> 06:29.182
Oh. Well, I think of you as a friend, too.

06:30.141 --> 06:31.850
Can I make it up to you?

06:31.935 --> 06:33.894
Let's, like,
do something really fun today.

06:33.978 --> 06:37.315
Spend the whole day together,
do our, like, Ferris Bueller's Day Off.

06:37.398 --> 06:38.942
Where would we go?

06:39.025 --> 06:41.527
I don't know,
there's so many options. Um...

06:41.610 --> 06:44.697
I know. Do you wanna go to, like, um,
like, a studio tour, right?

06:44.780 --> 06:47.783
'Cause you haven't even really seen LA.
What's more LA than a studio tour?

06:47.866 --> 06:52.455
-Are we talking, like, Universal?
-Mmm... that's a little played out.

06:52.538 --> 06:56.834
I was thinking something a little more
inside track, like, Mar Vista Studios.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.587
-Oh, I've never heard of that one.
-Very old school.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.340
It's where Gene Kelly shot
Singin' In The Rain.

07:02.423 --> 07:05.759
Oh, I might have seen that one,
like, 45 times.

07:05.843 --> 07:07.803
-This is gonna be perfect.
-This is gonna be great.

07:07.886 --> 07:10.556
Ahhh! I can't wait.

07:14.602 --> 07:15.811
No.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.981
No, that's a fucking stupid idea.

07:18.064 --> 07:21.359
No, too small.
Too... small.

07:21.442 --> 07:25.613
-Guys, I said I need big ideas.
-I still think that the haunted sock hop--

07:25.696 --> 07:29.325
No. A sock hop is not big, okay?
We're up against shows with...

07:29.408 --> 07:33.496
with dragons and... and zombies
and murdering strippers. Wake up.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.707
Anyone?

07:36.790 --> 07:38.501
Okay, uh, I have something.

07:39.210 --> 07:41.004
Um... It is--

07:41.087 --> 07:44.132
Let me just pitch it, okay?
It's called "Witch Hunt."

07:44.215 --> 07:46.759
And, um, the basic idea is that, um...

07:47.760 --> 07:51.722
like, a serial killer would come to town
and he knows that he can get away with it

07:51.805 --> 07:54.725
'cause he can blame the witches
for all the murders.

07:54.808 --> 07:58.021
-So... it's literally a witch hunt.
-Yeah.

07:58.104 --> 08:01.983
Let me ask you this.
Could Pastor Lewis be the killer?

08:02.066 --> 08:04.902
-Yeah. Yeah, that'd be cool.
-I like that.

08:04.986 --> 08:07.530
Yeah.  Okay.
Okay, this is interesting. Interesting.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.865
This could maybe work.
It's... it's big. It is big.

08:09.948 --> 08:13.161
It's bloody.
We could kill a lot of people.

08:13.244 --> 08:16.247
Yeah, and I really... I really like that
idea of Pastor Lewis being the killer.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.957
-That's the best part.
-That's a good idea, right? Uh-huh.

08:19.750 --> 08:23.087
-Good job, Wyatt.
-Thank you. One thing.

08:23.171 --> 08:26.174
Uh, the idea...
Okay, so we'd probably be fine,

08:26.257 --> 08:29.635
but the idea, as crazy as it sounds,
is actually Gus's.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.012
Gus the tutor.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.431
-What?
-Okay, here's what happened.

08:33.514 --> 08:36.184
He wrote a spec script.
He asked me to read it. It was awful.

08:36.267 --> 08:38.894
- Like, even the margins were...
- Oh, Jesus.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.773
...four inches wide for some reason,
but he had that idea in it.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.358
We just buy that idea from him.

08:44.442 --> 08:47.278
No, no, that's not how it works, Wyatt.
You can't just buy an idea.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.363
You have to buy the whole fucking script.

08:49.447 --> 08:51.615
Okay. So can we afford that?
I mean, that's fine.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.910
Sure we can. Because that's
one less script for all of you now.

08:54.993 --> 08:59.248
- Great, Wyatt.
- Fucking Gus.

08:59.332 --> 09:01.209
Coming up on our right
is a storefront

09:01.292 --> 09:04.462
that doubled as a café
for the romantic comedy Holidays.

09:04.545 --> 09:08.049
Oh, you mean, The Holiday,
starring Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet.

09:08.132 --> 09:11.052
Uh, no, Holidays.
It was a cable movie-of-the-week in 1984.

09:11.135 --> 09:13.429
So, on your left, we have a very--

09:13.512 --> 09:14.597
-Question. Sorry.
-Yes?

09:14.680 --> 09:16.265
Do you know where
they did shoot The Holiday?

09:16.349 --> 09:19.518
Cameron and Kate are two lonely women
from opposite sides of the Atlantic,

09:19.602 --> 09:23.397
who swap houses and inhibitions
in an epic tale of love and laughter.

09:23.481 --> 09:25.733
Uh, I don't know, but, uh,
it wasn't shot here.

09:25.816 --> 09:27.025
What a shame.

09:27.110 --> 09:31.239
So, Cameron rents an English cottage
to escape her hectic life as a publicist,

09:31.322 --> 09:34.200
and she ends up in the arms
of Kate's brother,

09:34.283 --> 09:37.078
played with rugged charm
by Jude Law.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.289
Sorry, you go.
Yeah, you go.

09:40.373 --> 09:42.791
Okay. So on your left
is a courthouse--

09:42.875 --> 09:46.420
I'm sorry... Jack Black stars
as Kate Winslet's love interest

09:46.504 --> 09:49.673
in a surprising performance
as a leading man.

09:49.757 --> 09:52.218
And you can...
you can go... go again.

09:52.301 --> 09:54.512
Okay.
Coming up is our so-called Tin Can--

09:54.595 --> 09:56.764
And Kate Winslet won
a 2007 Teen's Choice Award.

09:56.847 --> 09:59.016
You go, sorry.
Go. Yeah.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.602
-This is such a good tour.
-I'm so glad you're having a good time.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.937
If you want gifts,
they're in the gift shop.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.982
If you want photos with me,
I'm available.

10:08.109 --> 10:09.652
So we need to get
a final list of everybody

10:09.735 --> 10:10.861
who's gonna be from the network.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.447
So we need to make sure
everybody has a drive on,

10:13.531 --> 10:16.825
we have enough chairs for everybody,
we have enough hard copies for everybody.

10:16.909 --> 10:20.037
-Can you get on that for me? Thank you.
-Hey. Susan, you wanted to see me?

10:20.121 --> 10:22.165
Yeah. Have a seat.

10:26.043 --> 10:30.756
So, uh, you wrote a spec script
called "Witch Hunt," correct?

10:30.839 --> 10:32.007
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.386
Was that bad? Am I in trouble?
I... I, like, did it on my own worktime.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.512
We want to buy it.

10:37.596 --> 10:38.639
What?

10:38.722 --> 10:41.517
You hit on a premise
we wanna use for episode 12.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.228
Wow. Ooh.

10:44.312 --> 10:47.315
That's, uh... how did that happen?
What--

10:47.398 --> 10:49.400
Yeah, we'll talk about all that later.
Here's the deal.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.693
-Okay. Mmm-hmm.
-The offer is scale.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.861
And if you stay on top
of your tutoring duties,

10:52.945 --> 10:54.822
I will even consider
letting you sit in on the rewrite.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.115
But if the answer is no,
tell me now so I can move on.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.578
Yes. I mean,
if that's what the deal is then, yes.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.372
I don't even have to think about it.
Yes, uh, deal.

11:03.456 --> 11:06.750
All right. Connor will be in touch,
and we'll work out all the details later.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.461
-Great.
-All right.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.128
God, it feels good to be in here.

11:10.213 --> 11:12.215
-The sanctuary.
-Um, I... I have to get back to work.

11:12.298 --> 11:14.174
-Right. Okay, yeah. Okay.
-But thank you so much, Gus.

11:14.258 --> 11:16.427
-Thank you. Mmm-hmm.
-Thank you.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.354
And if you look to your left,

11:26.437 --> 11:28.814
you will see our famous
New York City street.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.817
Now this facade has changed
numerous times over the years.

11:31.900 --> 11:37.281
Most recently it has been redressed to
be the main street in the show Witchita.

11:37.365 --> 11:39.658
-Oh, my God. Bertie.
-So everybody follow me.

11:39.742 --> 11:43.161
That's Gus's show. It shoots on this lot.
We should go say hi to him.

11:43.246 --> 11:47.291
-Oh. Um... I don't really want to.
-What? Come on, it'll be so much fun.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.793
We can't be on the lot
and not say hi to him.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.795
Besides, this tour is so boring, isn't it?

11:51.879 --> 11:53.422
Oh.

11:53.506 --> 11:56.509
-What?
-This day isn't about me at all, is it?

11:57.593 --> 11:58.969
What are you talking about?
Of course it is.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.515
You just want to see Gus.
That's why you brought me here,

12:02.598 --> 12:05.017
'cause you thought it would be too weird
to show up here on your own.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.270
It's like how you didn't wanna go
to the party on your own.

12:07.353 --> 12:10.063
You didn't really need me there,
you just wanted a wingman.

12:10.147 --> 12:13.859
What? Is that what you really think?
Wow. I...

12:16.445 --> 12:20.198
All right, you're right.
That's exactly what I'm doing right now.

12:20.283 --> 12:24.870
-And I'm really sorry.
-It's okay. I understand. It's cool.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.373
Wait. Well, don't walk away.
You could call me a name.

12:27.456 --> 12:28.541
Yell at me.
Call me a bitch.

12:28.624 --> 12:31.209
I'm a narcissistic asshole.
I could take it.

12:31.294 --> 12:33.587
No, thanks.
See you later.

12:33.671 --> 12:35.756
I'll come catch up with you in,
like, 15 minutes.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.603
- Hey, hey.
- Hey, what's up.

12:49.687 --> 12:52.690
Uh... they're buying the script I wrote.

12:53.482 --> 12:54.483
What?

12:54.567 --> 12:57.110
The script I wrote,
Witchita is buying.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.862
-It's gonna be episode 12.
-Oh, my God!

12:58.946 --> 13:00.739
-That is huge!
-I know. It's--

13:00.823 --> 13:02.115
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.284
- Yeah. Thank you. Yeah.
- How big is my part?

13:04.368 --> 13:06.161
- Pretty big. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It is? Okay.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.206
Well, it's an awesome idea. It's like,
a serial killer comes to town, right?

13:09.289 --> 13:10.833
-Okay.
-Okay, so they start blaming the witches.

13:10.916 --> 13:11.917
-Genius.
-Yeah.

13:36.567 --> 13:39.737
Gotta say, don't you think
we're a little exposed here? Kind of?

13:39.820 --> 13:44.157
Yeah. I know. That's what makes it
so hot, right? Just... just relax, okay?

13:44.241 --> 13:45.659
Okay. Okay.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.537
Oh, God.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.083
You know what?
I think they shot Titanic here.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.794
Like, because of the size
they can put a water tank in here.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.713
Shh. Just shut up.
You're wrecking this for me.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.257
- Okay?
- Okay.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.635
Ooh.

14:03.427 --> 14:07.180
Knock, knock.
Oh, hey.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.475
-Are you Arya?
-Yeah.

14:09.558 --> 14:11.351
I'm Mickey.
I'm Gus's friend.

14:11.435 --> 14:14.271
-Okay.
-Is he around?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.189
No, he'll be right back.

14:16.273 --> 14:18.984
-Well, could I wait here for him?
-All right.

14:25.032 --> 14:28.536
-So... what are you watching?
-American Horror Story.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.997
- Oh. Which season?
- Two.

14:32.080 --> 14:36.544
Two. Is it okay if I sit with you?
What happens in it?

14:37.586 --> 14:40.130
It's like... it's about an asylum.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.550
It's like, Zachary Quinto
raping dead bodies.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.884
You like that kind of shit?

14:43.967 --> 14:46.929
I love it. I think it's so much
better than comedy.

14:47.012 --> 14:48.556
I just don't find comedy funny.

14:48.639 --> 14:52.476
-So your parents let you watch this stuff?
-No. But I just watch it at work.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.437
Does Gus watch it with you?

14:54.520 --> 14:57.230
Well, I tried to get him to watch it,
but he was too scared.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.444
He's kind of like a wimp, isn't he?

15:01.527 --> 15:05.531
Yeah. He's, like... He gets more scared
than most of my friends.

15:05.614 --> 15:07.157
Have you ever seen him cry?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.910
Hey, Dad.
How's it goin'?

15:11.119 --> 15:14.331
Good. Uh...
I got some good news.

15:15.541 --> 15:19.878
Yes. Uh... you know the TV show Witchita?

15:21.213 --> 15:25.050
They bought my script!
Yes, they bought a script I wrote.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.594
Yeah, get Mom on the phone.

15:27.428 --> 15:29.346
You should start reading
true crime novels.

15:29.430 --> 15:32.475
They're just like
American Horror Story, but real.

15:32.558 --> 15:33.642
What's a good one?

15:33.726 --> 15:38.981
-Uh, Executioner's Song by Norman Mailer.
-What's it about?

15:39.064 --> 15:42.860
This guy Gary Gilmore, he killed a bunch
of people, but he's, like, weirdly sexy.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.487
Okay, love you, Dad.
Bye.

15:44.570 --> 15:48.198
-Hi!
-Hi.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.367
Bertie made me take
this really boring studio tour.

15:50.451 --> 15:51.827
And then I saw the Witchita trailer,

15:51.910 --> 15:53.411
and I was like,
"Oh, my God, I gotta come visit."

15:53.496 --> 15:55.664
And then I met this
little ball of sunshine.

15:55.748 --> 15:58.416
Oh, cool. Um...

15:59.502 --> 16:03.005
Uh... you really shouldn't be here.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.883
No! Oh, my God.
Arya and I are such good friends now.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.594
She is way cooler than that stupid tour.

16:08.677 --> 16:11.847
The studio tour is bullshit.
My uncle went on it and he hated it.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.099
-This is barely a working lot.
-Mmm-hmm.

16:14.975 --> 16:17.269
Gus, there you are.
Hi, Arya.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.104
Uh, Heidi would like you
at the table read.

16:19.187 --> 16:23.275
Oh, yeah, probably has something
to do with my script.

16:23.358 --> 16:28.405
-What do you mean your script?
-Yeah, uh, Witchita bought my spec script.

16:28.489 --> 16:29.698
Gus!

16:29.782 --> 16:31.825
-Oh, my God, Gus.
-Isn't that cool? Yeah. Yeah.

16:31.909 --> 16:35.287
-Oh, that's so amazing.
-Are you guys, like, a couple?

16:35.370 --> 16:40.250
Uh, we're a... couple of something.
Yeah. Yep.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.961
That is the least sexy thing
I've ever heard.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.132
Hey, so, um...
I should probably get going.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.551
Okay, great.
I'll come with you.

16:48.634 --> 16:52.429
Oh, you know, um...
I don't think that's a good idea.

16:52.513 --> 16:55.432
Don't be such a stick in the mud.
Is he always this lame?

16:55.516 --> 16:57.893
-Usually much worse.
-Let's go. Okay.

16:57.976 --> 16:59.812
Okay, great.
It was really nice meeting you, Arya.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.897
-Follow me on Instagram.
-Okay.

17:01.980 --> 17:03.816
Network table read, huh?

17:03.899 --> 17:06.484
-Yeah.
-Never been to one of those.

17:06.569 --> 17:09.237
Yeah, they're pretty private.
Sorry.

17:09.321 --> 17:12.115
Well, maybe I could stick around
and we'll have a coffee after.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.868
Uh... hey, you know what?
I just...

17:14.952 --> 17:18.038
I think, uh,
I'm gonna be really busy and, um...

17:18.997 --> 17:22.417
I don't wanna be late for this.
So, uh, talk later?

17:22.500 --> 17:25.253
Yeah, why don't you call me later tonight?

17:25.337 --> 17:27.339
-Yeah, we'll figure something out.
-Or tomorrow, or--

17:27.422 --> 17:28.924
Definitely, definitely.
We'll talk.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.509
-Good luck.
-Okay. Bye.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.528
Uh, this is where the writers sit.

17:50.613 --> 17:52.155
Oh.

17:52.239 --> 17:55.158
Yeah, didn't you hear?
They're buying my script, so...

17:55.242 --> 17:57.410
This isn't your episode.
Take it back a row.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.037
You want me to...

17:59.121 --> 18:00.914
- Yeah, it's just not--
- So Rebecca can sit there.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.125
- Oh.
- She's a full-timer.

18:03.208 --> 18:05.919
- Yeah. No, no, no, no.
- I...  I get it.

18:06.003 --> 18:08.463
-No offense, but sit back there.
-No, no. No, none taken.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.759
-Thanks, dude.
-This is actually kind of a better angle.

18:11.842 --> 18:13.385
- Great. Good.
- Great.

18:13.468 --> 18:14.720
--All right.

18:14.803 --> 18:20.058
This is... episode 311,
"Bring Out the Dead,"

18:20.142 --> 18:24.855
written and directed
by yours truly, Susan Cheryl.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.990
"Exterior, Witchita.

18:35.073 --> 18:38.827
The rising sun pours forth
its crimson light

18:38.911 --> 18:43.373
as if anticipating the scarlet hues
of bloodshed.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.918
We hear a disembodied voice."

18:46.001 --> 18:50.505
"Awake, little town.
As the sun rises, the dark powers rest.

18:50.588 --> 18:53.091
But tonight, the dead will have their day,

18:53.175 --> 18:57.137
and your day will become
a waking nightmare."

18:57.220 --> 19:01.266
"A single raindrop dangles
from the church steeple."

19:11.819 --> 19:13.696
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

19:13.779 --> 19:16.657
Hi. Do you have any romantic
comedy-themed merchandise?

19:16.740 --> 19:19.076
Preferably something
with Winslet and Diaz?

19:19.159 --> 19:22.245
Uh...  no, sorry.

19:23.371 --> 19:25.332
-This is very disappointing.
-Yeah.

19:25.415 --> 19:28.085
I've had a depressing day
and I just wanted to get something

19:28.168 --> 19:32.172
that would remind me that happiness
can find you when you least expect it.

19:32.255 --> 19:37.010
We have some new T-shirts on sale.
They got the Mar Vista Studios logo.

19:37.094 --> 19:40.681
-Well, that's something.
-Yeah. Real comfortable. 100% cotton.

19:40.764 --> 19:41.974
-Wow.
-Yeah.

19:42.057 --> 19:44.309
-Not all T-shirts have that. That's great.
-Uh-huh.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.228
Do you have anything other than triple-XL?

19:46.311 --> 19:49.231
No. I mean,
that's why they're on sale, you know.

19:49.314 --> 19:53.151
-I could maybe wear it as a nightgown...
-Yeah.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.237
-...or when I'm cleaning.
-Yeah.

19:56.780 --> 19:57.948
Yeah.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.035
-I'm gonna take two.
-Oh, cool. Awesome.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.794
Hey, Gus!

20:10.878 --> 20:14.381
Hey. Mickey.
You're still here?

20:14.464 --> 20:16.174
Can I talk to you for one second?

20:16.258 --> 20:18.676
Uh... okay.

20:20.678 --> 20:22.389
-Hi, hi. Hi.
-Hey.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.766
-Um...
-What's up?

20:23.849 --> 20:25.350
Well, I don't know.
What is up?

20:25.433 --> 20:26.852
I thought we had a good time
the other night.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.979
-Did we not have a good time?
-Yeah, no, totally.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.063
-We totally did.
-Okay.

20:30.147 --> 20:32.733
Then why are you being so mean to me?
Did I do something?

20:32.816 --> 20:34.151
Could you just tell me what I did?

20:34.234 --> 20:35.819
And then I'll leave you alone.
I'll go away.

20:36.528 --> 20:40.657
Okay. Well, first of all, you showed up
unannounced again, you know?

20:40.741 --> 20:43.326
You did it last night at my house
and now you're doing it at my job.

20:43.410 --> 20:46.329
So, I don't know what you're expecting
my reaction to be.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.165
Like, you want it to be positive?
I mean--

20:48.248 --> 20:51.293
I'm just picking up on what you put down.
I mean, we had sex two days ago.

20:51.376 --> 20:52.669
-Do you not remember that?
-Okay. Yeah.

20:52.753 --> 20:54.004
- We have sex...
- Ooh.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.672
-...and you turn into this huge dick.
-Oh, shit.

20:55.756 --> 20:58.801
What about you, you know?
You're pretending to, like, be this, like,

20:58.884 --> 21:02.805
cool girl, you know, who doesn't
follow the rules of how things go,

21:02.888 --> 21:04.431
but then we have sex,

21:04.514 --> 21:07.725
and then you immediately
become like every other lame girl

21:07.810 --> 21:10.395
who, like, gets clingy
and won't give a guy space. Okay?

21:10.478 --> 21:12.898
Surprise!
I'm not the cool girl, okay?

21:12.981 --> 21:15.692
I'm not just some girl
that you can fuck for a while

21:15.776 --> 21:18.403
to prove to yourself that
you can be dangerous and edgy,

21:18.486 --> 21:19.780
and you're not some huge dork,

21:19.863 --> 21:21.949
and then you go off
and marry whatever boring lady.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.576
Okay, so that's what I am to you then.
I'm just this fucking dork, huh?

21:24.659 --> 21:27.245
I'm this fucking dork who you fuck
and then you can feel like

21:27.329 --> 21:29.747
you're getting your life together
'cause you're fucking a nice guy

21:29.832 --> 21:32.084
and you're not fucking
a piece of shit anymore, okay?

21:32.167 --> 21:33.877
-No! No!
-Don't make me that guy, okay?

21:33.961 --> 21:35.212
I like you.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.130
And you can't handle it.
And guess what?

21:37.214 --> 21:40.675
Everything that I'm doing right now,
if you liked me, you would be so into it.

21:40.758 --> 21:41.759
-Oh, whatever. No.
-You would love it

21:41.844 --> 21:43.720
-if some girl just showed up at your work.
-No!

21:43.804 --> 21:46.389
I wouldn't. No.
Because this job is important to me, okay?

21:46.473 --> 21:49.726
And just because, like, you're okay
with, like, fucking up your life,

21:49.810 --> 21:52.479
doesn't mean you can just
come in and fuck up my life!

21:52.562 --> 21:55.273
Ooh. Wow, you're mean.
Do you know that?

21:55.357 --> 21:57.609
-Oh, I'm the mean one?
-You're actually a really mean person.

21:57.692 --> 22:00.028
-You're the mean one.
-No, you're a huge prick.

22:00.112 --> 22:02.364
You pretend to be nice and that's worse.

22:02.447 --> 22:04.616
I am who I am.
I'm not pretending to be anything.

22:04.699 --> 22:07.577
What is that even... I don't even know...
You're fucking crazy right now.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.621
I am not crazy!

22:09.704 --> 22:11.581
-You're being crazy.
-Don't make me feel crazy!

22:11.664 --> 22:14.792
And here she is.
That's the girl that you fucked

22:14.877 --> 22:17.129
-the day after we had sex! Yes.
-Whoa.

22:17.212 --> 22:18.255
Are you okay, sweetheart?

22:18.338 --> 22:19.965
- No, I'm not okay.
- Okay.

22:20.048 --> 22:22.009
Okay, Heidi, can you just,
uh, give us some...

22:22.092 --> 22:23.343
I'm just trying to figure this out.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.553
No problem at all.
I hope you feel better.

22:25.637 --> 22:27.180
Yeah, I hope you go fuck yourself!

22:27.264 --> 22:29.474
Hey! Will you be nice?
Can you just be nice?

22:29.557 --> 22:31.518
You're not nice.
You're fucking mean.

22:31.601 --> 22:33.561
-And it's not nice to have sex with me...
-Hey, handle this.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.981
-Just a sec. Okay. All right.
-...and then the next day fuck her.

22:36.064 --> 22:37.440
-You're being crazy.
-I'm not crazy!

22:37.524 --> 22:39.109
-You're being crazy!
-No, I'm not being crazy!

22:39.192 --> 22:41.694
-This is over. This is over.
-You know what? Fuck this.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.571
You can't throw me out,
'cause I wanna fucking go.

22:43.655 --> 22:46.199
-Okay, then go. Go, please, go.
-You are lame. Bye.

22:46.283 --> 22:48.285
Can I have security
at the front gate please?

22:48.368 --> 22:50.037
Yeah. Whoo!

22:50.120 --> 22:52.455
- Is this the right way?
- Yes, it is.

22:55.208 --> 22:59.337
Okay. All right, all right.
I got it. I got it. Jesus fucking Christ.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.630
Thank you.

23:10.473 --> 23:14.311
Bertie? Hey, this is Mickey.
I'm sorry, I know I fucked up.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.813
I'm an asshole.
Can you just call me back, please?

23:16.896 --> 23:20.733
'Cause I... I need to talk to you
right now, okay? All right.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.571
Fuck.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.283
Thanks again for picking me up
from the studios.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.493
I can't believe Mickey ditched me.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.580
Oh, it's all right. I was...
wasn't working today, anyway, so...

23:33.663 --> 23:35.915
Oh, really?
What do you do?

23:35.999 --> 23:38.668
Oh, well, uh, I'm un...
unemployed right now.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.172
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.924
You know, Ferris Bueller would
never do what Mickey did.

23:45.008 --> 23:46.676
He was really loyal to his friends.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.845
The only ones he ever lied to
were the grown-ups.

23:48.928 --> 23:53.475
Yeah, and you know what's weird?
It's how, like, we're the grown-ups now.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.268
Oh, I've felt like a grown-up for ages.

23:55.352 --> 23:57.395
In Australia, we start drinking
when we're 12.

23:57.479 --> 24:01.191
-Twelve? That's really young, right?
-Oh, yeah.

24:01.274 --> 24:05.278
At 12, I was probably
still sleeping in my mom's bed.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.738
Excuse me?

24:06.821 --> 24:09.992
Yeah, between my mom and dad.
I watched a lot of scary movies.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.920
Susan, I am so, so sorry.

24:23.005 --> 24:26.508
This show is not your personal
episode of The Bachelor.

24:26.591 --> 24:30.095
I know that. I know.
And just so you know, like,

24:30.178 --> 24:32.680
I didn't invite that woman, okay?
I barely know her.

24:32.764 --> 24:36.143
And I don't invite anybody on set.
Even, like, when my mom was in town--

24:36.226 --> 24:38.436
-Gus, shut up.
-Yes, ma'am.

24:38.520 --> 24:43.441
You are on thin fucking ice.
Now, you just sold a script to this show.

24:43.525 --> 24:47.320
This week could be the first week
of your writing career or the last.

24:47.404 --> 24:48.905
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

24:48.988 --> 24:54.119
-Yes. Absolutely. Totally, yes.
-Good. Now get out.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.607
- Hey, this is Gus. Leave a message.
