WEBVTT

00:21.730 --> 00:25.692
Take this one now.
Tie 'em up right there.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.862
Boy, stop skylarkin'.

00:32.156 --> 00:34.117
Wow, this place looks amazing.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.245
Just the beginning, my friend.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.583
You look underwhelmed.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.127
What you want me to do, dance?

00:44.211 --> 00:45.754
It's been two years.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.131
Yes, I'm very happy to be home.

00:48.215 --> 00:51.051
But you?
You'll cry when you have to leave.

00:51.134 --> 00:53.136
Trinidad will get into your soul.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.973
Now we have to get these barrels
where they're going.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.185
Alright.

01:00.269 --> 01:03.605
Oh! Sea leg and seashore ain't friend,
you know.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.941
I just need to... get my balance.

01:06.024 --> 01:08.193
You need more than that
with your <i>mawga</i> self.

01:08.277 --> 01:11.822
- You catch a stiff breeze, you're gone.
- I'm not <i>that</i> skinny.

01:11.905 --> 01:14.449
I'll find you some good
Trinidadian bush medicine.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.496
When I was a boy,
I would come down here every day.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.082
I had no idea
such a place could exist!

01:22.165 --> 01:24.668
Bet you never thought
you'd find yourself this far from...

01:24.751 --> 01:26.628
- Hey, what the name again?
- Avonlea.

01:26.712 --> 01:28.505
I used to shop here for my mom.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.882
Every ingredient she cooked with
had to be fresh.

01:30.966 --> 01:32.467
Nothing stale in her kitchen.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.511
All these smells
are making me hungry.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.972
You have anything good to eat
up on Prince Edward?

01:37.055 --> 01:39.808
- I like potatoes.
- C'mon, potatoes?

01:39.891 --> 01:41.810
Give me something to work with here!

01:41.893 --> 01:45.230
Well... Mrs. Kincannon
would serve crab every once in a while.

01:45.314 --> 01:48.317
Now we're gettin' somewhere!
How'd she prepare it?

01:48.984 --> 01:51.778
Boil it, I think. Add some salt.

01:51.862 --> 01:54.906
That's it? Crab with... salt?

01:56.325 --> 01:57.451
What's wrong with that?

01:57.534 --> 02:00.454
Nothing.
Crab nice when you cook it up right.

02:00.537 --> 02:03.165
Like Mommy's crab callaloo.
Sunday food.

02:03.248 --> 02:07.044
She'd boil down a pile of dasheen leaves
in coconut milk,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.670
throw in some onions, garlic, okra,

02:09.755 --> 02:11.882
a pig tail and then the crab.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.426
Add a whole pimento pepper
and let it simmer.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.970
I don't think I've ever had
a hot pepper in my life.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.388
Yeah, you?

02:18.472 --> 02:21.350
Your little dry-up body
would go to war against itself!

02:21.767 --> 02:23.060
I think I could handle it.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.564
Mommy'd say, "Bash, come for a taste."

02:27.648 --> 02:31.068
I'd tip my head back
and she'd feed me a spoonful.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.903
I can almost taste it now,

02:32.986 --> 02:36.281
sliding down my throat
like spicy green medicine.

02:36.782 --> 02:37.991
Sounds delicious.

02:38.575 --> 02:39.660
Oh, it was.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.079
But it was always just the one taste.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.914
Then she'd serve the family...

02:44.665 --> 02:47.167
and I'd be given the scraps
that were left.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.212
Why didn't you eat with the family?

02:50.295 --> 02:52.422
It wasn't my family.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.091
Whose family was it?

02:54.174 --> 02:56.301
The white people
she worked for, Blythe.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.179
I feel like an idiot. I'm so sorry.

02:59.262 --> 03:02.599
Don't be. Still got more flavor
from one spoonful every Sunday

03:02.682 --> 03:05.519
than you had in your whole life,
from the sounds of it.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.522
Crab with... here it comes...
the secret ingredient:

03:08.605 --> 03:10.607
salt.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.528
Oh, wow. What a beauty.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.196
Hey.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.074
I used to ride one just like her.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.369
Come on over here, Bash.
She's friendly.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.662
I have a thing about horses.

03:23.745 --> 03:27.124
You, boy, since you're already
sniffing around my horse,

03:27.207 --> 03:29.209
go on to the stable
and fetch her some feed.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.254
Angling for a tip
before the job's even done?

03:32.337 --> 03:35.716
I am not your boy.
I am a free man, sir. Since 1834.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.677
I'm sure you can find assistance
inside the hotel.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.228
That was messed up.
He just assumed you were a servant.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.481
Way things are.
If we cried every time that happens,

03:51.565 --> 03:53.650
the whole of Trinidad would be flooded.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.153
Now let's get us
to a better neighborhood.

03:56.236 --> 03:59.030
You still need some medicine.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.504
Morning. Glad you're up.

04:55.587 --> 04:57.255
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

04:57.339 --> 05:00.133
To think that we've been walking on gold
in Avonlea.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.637
I well understand your... moral quandary.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.223
We're all so grateful and excited.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.727
Reading about gold
is perfectly wonderful, but...

05:10.811 --> 05:14.314
it would be even more wonderful
if I could... see it.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.149
Uh-huh.

05:17.150 --> 05:19.486
This sort of thing
really isn't for children.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.156
But you're not just a simple girl,
now, are you?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.247
Ah, there.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.207
Spectacular.

05:37.963 --> 05:39.339
I'm not...

05:40.257 --> 05:41.758
What do...?

05:42.884 --> 05:45.554
It is... gold, isn't it?

05:46.346 --> 05:47.973
Let your eyes adjust.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.058
Don't rush it.

05:50.141 --> 05:52.310
You might find it more beautiful
than you imagined.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.564
See the tiny bits among
the red, how they sparkle?

05:55.981 --> 05:57.524
Why can't I see it?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.484
Ah, it's not your fault, pipsqueak.

05:59.568 --> 06:02.654
In fact, it's mine, and I apologize.
You just don't have an expert eye.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.656
Please don't give up on me.

06:09.578 --> 06:11.746
Oh, yes, there it is.

06:11.830 --> 06:15.000
You're right, Nate.
The gold's exquisite.

06:18.712 --> 06:22.882
Miss Marilla, don't you just look
like a bright shiny penny this morning.

06:26.886 --> 06:30.390
Oh, Mr. Dunlop, the toast smells
especially good this morning.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.226
Cinnamon, my dear girl, in celebration.

06:33.893 --> 06:37.397
Any morning we don't find ourselves
in the grave should be celebrated.

06:37.480 --> 06:39.316
Right indeed, Miss Marilla.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.485
I agree with Mr. Dunlop.
Pass the celebratory toast.

06:43.320 --> 06:46.489
Now, Matthew,
I'd like to do the extractions for you.

06:46.573 --> 06:50.577
Happy to do you that favor.
Let's be sure this is done right. Hmm?

06:53.038 --> 06:54.914
There will be no gold testing.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.376
At least not yet.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.211
Matthew and I are undecided.

07:00.295 --> 07:03.131
But you have to! We could be one
of the richest families in Avonlea.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.550
Matthew wouldn't have to farm anymore
and you could do any...

07:05.634 --> 07:08.970
It's expensive, Anne, and we worked
very hard for that harvest money.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.351
Matthew, Miss Marilla,

07:14.434 --> 07:17.062
I think your caution is absolutely right.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.857
The gold is all but guaranteed,
but there is still some risk.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.193
Well, now, Anne,

07:23.276 --> 07:26.863
I suppose it's about time
that you got a new slate.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.326
Thank you, Matthew.
I didn't want to ask,

07:31.409 --> 07:34.204
although technically
I broke it defending myself.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.538
Sounds like a good story.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.374
Not one
she'll have time to tell.

07:37.457 --> 07:41.169
You can pick up a new slate
from the general store after school, Anne.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.506
- Now eat up, then off you go.
- Ah, children.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.258
So precious... so expensive.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.596
Why didn't you tell Nate the truth?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.807
I thought seeing the gold in the soil
would be obvious.

07:53.890 --> 07:57.227
He thinks I'm a child. "Pipsqueak."

07:57.310 --> 08:00.230
You can't possibly expect
to be his equal, Anne.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.108
He's an adult and a scientist.

08:03.692 --> 08:06.027
Uh, but that's just book learning, though.

08:06.111 --> 08:08.488
And you've already proven
you're good at that.

08:09.239 --> 08:10.991
But you have something else.

08:11.366 --> 08:14.494
Remember when Minnie May was sick and
you put onions on the soles of her feet

08:14.577 --> 08:17.372
- to bring her fever down?
- That was an old wives' tale.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.958
It takes imagination
to believe in such a thing.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.420
Your imagination is a gift, Anne,
something that can't be learned.

08:23.503 --> 08:27.132
What good is an imagination if I can't see
what's right in front of my eyes?!

08:30.010 --> 08:32.345
This branch looks like a skeleton hand.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.850
An evil skeleton...

08:36.933 --> 08:39.144
that lives in the haunted forest...

08:39.852 --> 08:42.355
feeds on the lives of the innocent!

08:42.438 --> 08:44.733
Anne, that's horrible!

08:44.816 --> 08:46.943
Why are they clutching at us now?

08:47.027 --> 08:48.737
Do they mean to do us harm?

08:49.821 --> 08:53.241
Ghosts on the wind
bearing a warning: Beware!

08:53.324 --> 08:55.660
- They're coming for us!
- We must escape!

09:10.967 --> 09:13.386
Thank you again. Thank you.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.160
Is that Cole?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.412
- He looks different.
- He looks positively mature.

09:39.496 --> 09:41.998
Not at all like he did before harvest.

09:54.427 --> 09:57.263
Hey, Cole, throw the ball back, bud.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.600
Hey, sissy!

10:02.352 --> 10:03.895
Yeah, you!

10:06.231 --> 10:07.440
Oh.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.741
Nice arm, Rembrandt. Wanna play?

10:16.825 --> 10:19.619
No... I wouldn't. Thank you, though.

10:25.959 --> 10:29.170
"... answer'd Lancelot,
the chief of knights:

10:29.254 --> 10:30.713
'And with what face,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.549
after my pretext made,

10:32.632 --> 10:35.260
shall I appear, O Queen, at Camelot,

10:36.469 --> 10:40.056
I before a King who honors his word,

10:40.140 --> 10:43.476
- as if the word... '"
- I think the entire poem is shameful.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.937
They should be tarred and feathered.

10:46.020 --> 10:47.188
Josie?

10:47.272 --> 10:50.400
Guinevere is married to the king,
not Lancelot.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.652
Oh, Mr. Phillips,
can't you skip to the part

10:52.735 --> 10:56.364
where Elaine's pure and true love
turns most tragical?

10:56.447 --> 10:57.740
No.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.243
Do not interrupt me again.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.415
"'Yea, ' said the Queen,

11:05.498 --> 11:08.293
'A moral child without the craft to rule,

11:08.376 --> 11:10.920
else he had not lost me... '"

11:13.464 --> 11:14.299
Cole?

11:15.174 --> 11:17.260
What have you got there?

11:20.179 --> 11:21.264
Cole!

11:21.347 --> 11:23.933
My apologies, Mr. Phillips.
I'll clean it up.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.935
Are you doodling...

11:26.019 --> 11:30.523
while I'm tirelessly dedicating my life
to your education?

11:31.190 --> 11:33.860
Blackboard!

11:33.943 --> 11:35.320
Now!

11:59.719 --> 12:02.597
You like to draw? Draw that.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.725
Make sure it's legible.

12:11.940 --> 12:13.733
Back to your readers!

12:15.652 --> 12:17.862
"'Yea, ' said the Queen,

12:17.946 --> 12:20.448
'A moral child without the craft to rule,

12:20.531 --> 12:22.951
else he had not lost me... '"

12:34.379 --> 12:35.755
Less flourish.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.883
You're gonna need room for 50 of those.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.599
Fresh collard!

12:46.683 --> 12:48.101
Fresh cod!

12:52.814 --> 12:55.441
There are so many things
I miss about this place.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.778
Other things, I don't miss at all.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.282
- How much?
- How much you have?

13:04.117 --> 13:08.204
He doesn't have a thing. Not one cent.
I told you, this is only a shortcut.

13:09.539 --> 13:12.792
Why are you walking me through
all this delectable temptation?

13:12.875 --> 13:15.211
Just hold your horse, farm boy.

13:15.586 --> 13:19.382
- Oh, how about this? Just a taste?
- Nah. Don't eat that.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.552
Bash, I'm starving,
and that looks really good.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.595
Of course. Trinidadians can cook.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.848
Especially the dregs nobody else wants.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.350
But you have to taste
what we does do with real food.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.395
How about I go back
so I have something to compare it to?

13:32.478 --> 13:35.565
Patience, boy. Don't cry.
Hold this for now.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.152
It's a mango. Prepare for an experience.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.740
Hmm... Mmm! Mmm!

13:43.823 --> 13:47.160
It nice, eh? Don't swallow the skin.
Spit it out.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.329
If it's not gonna kill me,
why would I waste it?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.927
You traded this for a boiler room?

14:06.054 --> 14:08.723
To trade, you have to have a choice.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.989
- Hi, Mom.
- Sebastian!

14:25.948 --> 14:27.867
Boy, you trying to kill me?

14:28.451 --> 14:29.952
Anybody see you?

14:30.703 --> 14:32.872
Come, come, come, come.

14:33.664 --> 14:34.957
Come.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.669
Oh! Mm.

14:42.298 --> 14:45.218
Who is this boy you bring here
looking like a wet fowl?

14:45.301 --> 14:47.220
What name they christen you?

14:47.303 --> 14:51.099
Uh, Gilbert Blythe... ma'am.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.226
Well, I never.

14:53.309 --> 14:56.521
You must be the first
to ever call me "ma'am."

14:56.854 --> 14:58.189
Where you from?

14:58.272 --> 14:59.899
Prince Edward Island... Canada.

14:59.982 --> 15:03.569
They don't feed you on that boat,
Gilbert Blythe?

15:03.653 --> 15:08.366
Sebastian has promised me
the best in Trinidadian bush medicine?

15:09.534 --> 15:10.743
I see.

15:15.748 --> 15:18.918
Sebastian is so much more elegant
than Bash.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.546
Hush your mouth.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.923
I just made it.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.678
My mind told me
I might soon get to see my one son.

15:29.720 --> 15:31.222
Hazel!

15:31.305 --> 15:32.849
Oh.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.686
- Is he stealing?
- No, Doux-Doux.

15:36.769 --> 15:40.189
Remember Jesus say we have to help people.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.899
The men just hungry.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.402
Okay, you have your food.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.864
Uh... we could come back tomorrow.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.782
Nah, that is enough charity.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.368
If you come here again,
you're looking for trouble.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.705
Come, Doux-Doux.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.807
And, uh... what's this?

16:14.891 --> 16:17.602
A stick of thyme. Seasoning. The "bush."

16:18.811 --> 16:20.396
And, uh...

16:20.480 --> 16:21.814
this?

16:24.066 --> 16:25.401
A cornmeal dumpling.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.990
Hmm. Amazing.

16:31.073 --> 16:35.536
If this is medicine...
I wish I was sick every single day.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.417
Glad to see you're enjoying
the fruits of slave labor.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.255
I thought slavery ended here
over 50 years ago.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.758
My family never left that plantation.

16:49.634 --> 16:52.094
Not Granny... not Mom.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.640
She raised them children.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.017
I hardly know her.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.912
Thank you.

18:00.705 --> 18:02.498
Mr. Cuthbert...

18:02.957 --> 18:05.376
is it ugly, the gold mines?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.295
May well be.

18:07.962 --> 18:10.715
- Where will you put it?
- We haven't decided yet.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.683
You should've stopped him
from getting on that steamship, Anne.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.436
If Gilbert falls overboard and drowns,
it'll all be your fault.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.939
He'd come home soon enough
if he knew there was gold on his farm.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.525
Anne is writing him a letter,
aren't you, Anne?

18:30.735 --> 18:32.278
He looks so awfully lonely.

18:32.862 --> 18:35.656
I think he's more sad
and handsome than lonely.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.743
Josie's dead gone over Cole.

18:38.826 --> 18:41.245
I am not. I'm simply observant.

18:41.329 --> 18:45.958
There is no boy more sad and handsome
than Gilbert Blythe.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.296
I know just how he feels.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.551
Your drawing was exquisite.
It brought Camelot to life.

18:55.635 --> 18:58.262
And plus, Billy Andrews is a barbarian.

18:58.346 --> 19:01.182
I have strawberry tarts to share.
May we join you?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.522
Aren't you girls coming over?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.115
Diana has strawberry tarts.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.998
Sorry, Josie,
but strawberry's my favorite.

19:27.625 --> 19:29.085
Thank you.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.004
- Would you like a tart?
- I'd love some.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.714
Why, of course, Prissy,

19:33.798 --> 19:36.175
I'd love to join you
and the older girls for lunch.

19:36.258 --> 19:39.679
- Would anyone like a cookie?
- That looks exquisite!

19:45.434 --> 19:48.729
C-A-T. Cat.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.066
Mr. Cuthbert, look.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.276
I write English.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.374
- I'm... I'm done.
- Sorry.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.377
I... I... I do hay now.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.302
There's no such thing as ghosts.
There's no such thing as ghosts.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.930
There's no such thing as ghosts.

20:51.292 --> 20:54.336
I just survived
the most harrowing experience.

20:54.420 --> 20:58.966
I believe a terrifyingly evil curse
has befallen Avonlea.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.762
It pervades every alcove and crevice,
every tree and flower.

21:02.845 --> 21:04.638
All the spirits are stirring.

21:04.722 --> 21:08.517
I'm nearly certain I saw
a ghostly white lady down by the brook.

21:09.059 --> 21:10.644
- What does she want?
- Us!

21:10.728 --> 21:13.773
Oh, couldn't you just die of fright?

21:16.192 --> 21:18.861
It's not real, Ruby. Right, Anne?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.490
Thank you, Ruby. I take your tears
as the highest compliment.

21:22.573 --> 21:27.328
I call my story <i>The Haunted
Dell: A Most Shuddersome Tale.</i>

21:29.997 --> 21:31.874
You know how I admire your imagination,
Anne,

21:31.957 --> 21:33.918
but I just remembered I'm due at home.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.629
I better get home, too. It's getting dark.

21:36.712 --> 21:38.506
But you haven't heard the ending yet.

21:38.589 --> 21:41.509
I haven't thought of it,
but it promises to be very sinister.

21:41.592 --> 21:44.011
Uh, tomorrow maybe, on the way to school.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.889
A little further away from twilight. Bye.

21:47.556 --> 21:49.266
Be careful walking home!

21:55.481 --> 21:57.983
<i>The Haunted Dell,</i>

21:58.067 --> 22:01.028
by Anne Shirley Cuthbert.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.033
The... little girl...

22:08.244 --> 22:11.121
felt a dark force...

22:11.205 --> 22:12.832
lurking...

22:12.915 --> 22:16.210
just... beyond the trees.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.587
Oh!

22:23.759 --> 22:25.719
Please don't kill me.

22:25.803 --> 22:28.639
Please don't kill me,
please don't kill me.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.485
Hello.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.333
Come on.

22:58.961 --> 23:02.548
Oh, I just had a rapturous encounter
with a forest creature.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.967
What's wrong?

23:09.221 --> 23:11.056
My great-aunt Beatrice...

23:11.140 --> 23:12.558
She's died.

23:13.851 --> 23:16.604
Oh, Mr. Dunlop. Oh.

23:19.857 --> 23:23.360
There... there is a sizeable
inheritance, but...

23:23.444 --> 23:26.864
it is of little comfort.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.618
I was already an orphan,
like you, Anne, but now...

23:31.368 --> 23:32.536
I am truly alone.

23:33.537 --> 23:34.955
You're not alone.

23:35.456 --> 23:38.375
You have me, your little sister,
remember?

23:39.293 --> 23:41.128
You're a very sweet girl, Anne.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.465
Aunt Bea always wanted me
to have a fine family.

23:45.466 --> 23:47.801
Perhaps your aunt
will be a lovely ghost.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.137
Do you believe in ghosts?

23:50.220 --> 23:53.390
Interesting question.
Should I believe in them?

23:53.474 --> 23:55.726
I'm writing a story
called <i>The Haunted Dell.</i>

23:55.809 --> 23:58.604
And there's a ghost in it.
She's beautiful.

23:59.021 --> 24:03.233
It has me petrified, but it's my duty
as a storyteller to finish it.

24:03.317 --> 24:06.278
Aunt Bea loved a good scary story.

24:07.821 --> 24:12.743
Do you have... an instrument
worthy of capturing your fine work?

24:12.826 --> 24:15.996
- I prefer pen and ink to pencil.
- Oh, well,

24:16.080 --> 24:18.957
an author should have
the latest and most stylish

24:19.041 --> 24:20.626
of writing tools.

24:21.418 --> 24:23.170
I'd like you to have this.

24:26.757 --> 24:29.843
I shall cherish this always.
Thank you.

25:05.295 --> 25:06.380
Ah.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.882
Good evening, all.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.594
My day was incredibly productive.

25:13.095 --> 25:15.389
I spent a good part of it
chatting with William.

25:15.472 --> 25:17.474
- Who's that?
- Mr. Barry.

25:18.308 --> 25:22.229
According to William, apparently,
many people are skeptical about the gold,

25:22.312 --> 25:23.814
even after the town-hall meeting.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.650
That's to be expected.
It is unusual business.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.902
Well, we thought, William and I,

25:28.986 --> 25:32.072
that there should be
a less formal gathering

25:32.156 --> 25:35.409
where the people of Avonlea
can talk things out.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.244
- That's a splendid idea.
- Hmm.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.621
The Barrys have decided
to host a big party,

25:39.705 --> 25:41.415
for any and all interested folks.

25:41.498 --> 25:43.250
Rather classy, I say.

25:43.333 --> 25:46.128
Marilla, you and Matthew have to go!

25:46.837 --> 25:48.922
Sounds a rather frivolous affair.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.924
Well, perhaps, but it might
help you and Matthew

25:51.008 --> 25:53.260
to make your decision
one way or another.

25:59.141 --> 26:03.937
And also lemon squares, currant cake,
shortbread cookies.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.858
We need something festive, a showstopper.

26:08.358 --> 26:10.152
I wish I had more notice.

26:10.611 --> 26:13.030
- Nesslerode pie?
- What?

26:13.530 --> 26:15.449
I'll not have rum in this house, Mary Joe.

26:15.532 --> 26:19.286
- It's only for flavoring, ma'am.
- Eliza, I've invited a few more guests.

26:19.369 --> 26:21.538
If you could make arrangements
accordingly.

26:21.955 --> 26:25.793
Exactly how many?
Cakes aren't made by magic elves, dear.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.086
I shall need to secure Thomas Lynde

26:28.170 --> 26:31.298
before he consumes the entirety
of the sweets table.

26:31.840 --> 26:35.969
That scene at the church picnic
was very... unfortunate.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.972
See what you can do about that,
won't you, darling?

26:42.351 --> 26:44.311
Please take me with you.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.980
You've proven yourself old enough
to stay home alone.

26:47.064 --> 26:49.942
- Not afraid of the dark, are you?
- Not really.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.945
You were fine the night we went
to the town-hall meeting.

26:53.028 --> 26:56.365
My, my, you must've written
a bang-up ending for your story.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.534
The skeleton trees captured the girl

26:58.659 --> 27:00.327
and then indentured her
to the White Lady,

27:00.410 --> 27:03.205
- Queen of the Ghosts, and...
- Ghosts. Fiddlesticks.

27:03.664 --> 27:06.166
You'll stay here
and nothing untoward will happen.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.878
That should cure you
of imagining danger into this house.

27:38.240 --> 27:44.371
I worry that this gold is an open road...
to avarice in our... small town.

27:45.038 --> 27:48.876
Ah, but it's inspired such generosity
among your flock.

27:49.334 --> 27:53.380
Yes, well, $150.
A very large sum of money.

27:53.463 --> 27:57.384
Quite a lot of Sunday-service dimes, eh?

27:57.467 --> 28:00.554
And what does the...
philanthropist get in return

28:00.637 --> 28:04.892
for sparing his neighbor
the financial burden

28:04.975 --> 28:07.769
of paying for their own gold testing?

28:07.853 --> 28:12.149
A very small share
in his grateful neighbor's gold claim.

28:12.858 --> 28:15.944
That truly selfless act
might inspire the church

28:16.028 --> 28:20.324
to counsel other parishioners
on the... benefits of your offer.

28:21.158 --> 28:23.076
A righteous agreement, gentlemen.

28:32.502 --> 28:36.006
We can't let all this frivolity
go to waste, Miss Marilla.

28:39.176 --> 28:41.511
Ah, you could at least try
to have some fun.

28:50.854 --> 28:53.774
- Glass of frivolity at all?
- No, no, no.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.028
Did you change your hair?

29:02.449 --> 29:04.785
Nathaniel... a word?

29:06.036 --> 29:07.704
What can I do for you?

29:37.943 --> 29:41.655
He's quite the prize pony, your Nate.

29:41.738 --> 29:43.573
He's hardly mine.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.076
I just meant he's practically
part of the family now.

29:48.954 --> 29:50.872
You look lovely this evening, Marilla.

29:51.456 --> 29:53.166
That hairstyle suits you.

30:50.223 --> 30:51.308
Dear...

30:53.060 --> 30:54.311
Gilbert,

30:54.895 --> 30:56.188
How...

30:56.271 --> 30:57.481
are...

31:00.317 --> 31:01.943
Dear...

31:02.694 --> 31:04.321
Gilbert...

31:21.755 --> 31:25.133
Don't you just look
like a bright shiny penny this evening?

31:26.676 --> 31:28.595
Oh, well... thank you.

31:29.346 --> 31:32.224
- Are you enjoying the party?
- It's quite wonderful, yes.

31:32.307 --> 31:34.309
Glad to hear it.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.659
Your Rachel...
seems to be having a good time.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.953
Oh, belle of the ball, that one.

32:21.982 --> 32:25.735
Diana will already be miles ahead
when she gets to finishing school.

32:26.736 --> 32:29.531
Does that man have no sense of moderation?

32:30.323 --> 32:33.660
Ah! No reason
I can't make his gain my gain.

32:34.327 --> 32:35.162
Ahem.

32:36.746 --> 32:38.039
- Thomas!
- Hmm?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.167
- Are you enjoying yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.962
This gold business, eh? Exciting and...

32:44.045 --> 32:45.839
worrisome.

32:45.922 --> 32:48.049
- Would you consider...
- Now, Thomas,

32:48.133 --> 32:51.970
don't you shake hands on William's offer
until you've heard mine.

32:52.053 --> 32:54.890
Thomas, as your closer neighbor,

32:54.973 --> 32:57.225
in geography as well as friendship,

32:57.309 --> 32:59.352
I would like to fund your gold testing...

32:59.436 --> 33:02.606
if you can't or won't part
with the money up front...

33:02.689 --> 33:04.483
for a small stake in your claim.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.902
Same offer, smaller stake.

33:06.985 --> 33:08.612
I don't seek to profit,

33:08.695 --> 33:11.990
I just mean to lessen
your financial burden, Thomas.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.911
Gentlemen... thank you for the offers,

33:16.703 --> 33:18.663
I will take the matter up with my wife.

33:19.372 --> 33:22.959
I would never, uh,
make such a bold decision on my own.

33:35.805 --> 33:37.891
Lovely.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.893
Very good, very good.

33:39.976 --> 33:42.979
And for my brilliant
and nimble accompanist.

33:43.063 --> 33:45.273
<i>Brava.</i>

33:47.567 --> 33:50.695
- Very good, darling.
- Thank you, good people of Avonlea.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.156
I have news:

33:53.240 --> 33:54.908
My ship has come in.

33:54.991 --> 33:59.371
I've recently inherited some money
and the first thing I plan to do

33:59.454 --> 34:01.289
is buy land in Avonlea!

34:05.335 --> 34:08.922
The second thing I plan to do
is test my soil!

34:30.235 --> 34:32.987
Your house is filled with things
almost as pretty as you.

34:54.676 --> 34:58.263
Could that be the long-drawn wail
of two boughs rubbing together,

34:58.346 --> 35:01.683
or the cry of the unearthly creatures
I've called into being?

35:03.476 --> 35:06.354
If there is gold, we'd have
more than enough to take care of Anne.

35:06.438 --> 35:08.189
I suppose we should consider it.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.066
Well, now, I don't know.

35:10.567 --> 35:14.487
What if I paid the $150 for you
out of my inheritance?

35:14.571 --> 35:18.742
It's the least I could do to thank you,
and especially Anne,

35:18.825 --> 35:21.995
for welcoming me not only
into your home, but your lives.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.747
- We couldn't possibly...
- Ahem.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.499
- What are we talking about?
- Uh, Mr. Dunlop...

35:26.583 --> 35:29.461
has just offered to pay
for our gold testing.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.755
That's a lot of money, Mr. Dunlop.

35:31.838 --> 35:34.007
Now's not the time to make such decisions.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.844
We should get home to Anne before
she conjures herself a nervous breakdown.

35:37.927 --> 35:40.221
And I'll thank you, Mr. Dunlop,
not to encourage her.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.015
She's a great talent, our Anne.

35:42.098 --> 35:45.852
- I'll deliver our goodbyes to the Barrys.
- I'll harness the horse.

35:57.072 --> 36:00.742
An inheritance? Buying land?

36:00.825 --> 36:02.744
- What the hell?
- I'm shoring up the grift.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.538
You're sprung.
You're taking it too far.

36:05.622 --> 36:08.958
You never know.
Maybe "Dunlop" can make a home here.

36:09.626 --> 36:13.546
"Dunlop" is a dandy
whose brain is clouded by pastry

36:13.630 --> 36:15.340
and a red-headed little brat!

36:16.257 --> 36:19.344
Jonesey killed five guys
who cheated at cards with a blade

36:19.427 --> 36:21.554
and another just for scuffing his boots!

36:21.638 --> 36:24.641
Sure thing, loony, you'll fit right in.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.897
You want to come at me? Huh?

36:30.980 --> 36:33.400
I've been carrying
your dead weight for five years!

36:39.072 --> 36:40.782
Anne, are you hurt?!

36:40.865 --> 36:42.617
I was in a terrible dream.

36:42.701 --> 36:44.786
We're in such danger, Marilla.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.330
Oh, dear life and heart.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.250
It's all in your head, Anne.

36:52.794 --> 36:57.090
One day you may come to regret
the license you've given your imagination.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.800
Oh, no, Marilla.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.094
I wish I had more to give.

37:01.177 --> 37:03.513
My time at the asylum
might've been bearable

37:03.596 --> 37:07.350
if I'd have conjured you and Matthew
and Green Gables

37:07.434 --> 37:09.811
when I imagined my most perfect home.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.527
You must try and remember
what's real and good, Anne.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.281
Now get some rest.

37:26.202 --> 37:29.038
You may leave the lamp burning
if you promise not to touch it.

37:43.762 --> 37:47.140
Can you believe that Harmon Andrews
competing with me?

37:47.223 --> 37:50.226
Imagine... in my house.

37:50.310 --> 37:51.728
At my party.

37:53.980 --> 37:57.066
Was it a success? <i>Your</i> party?

37:58.276 --> 38:00.987
Did you secure the number of investments
you were after?

38:01.070 --> 38:02.739
It was a triumph.

38:03.406 --> 38:07.452
You made it very pretty,
and I left Andrews in the dust.

38:08.036 --> 38:09.996
How many tests are you underwriting?

38:10.580 --> 38:12.582
You sound like my Aunt Josephine.

38:12.665 --> 38:16.753
She is not the manager of our finances,
and neither are you.

38:18.087 --> 38:22.008
I'm not asking you to turn out the books,
but... I am your wife.

38:24.761 --> 38:28.014
Thomas Lynde never makes decisions
without consulting Rachel.

38:28.097 --> 38:30.517
Hmm. Rather undignified,
wouldn't you say?

38:30.600 --> 38:32.477
What if this little venture fails?

38:33.269 --> 38:36.105
Diana and Minnie May
must go to finishing school.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.150
- They simply must.
- Calm yourself, dear.

38:39.234 --> 38:42.278
The girls will be finished, never fear.

38:42.987 --> 38:45.198
And you know how much I would love
to go back home.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.408
I couldn't bear never seeing London again.

38:47.492 --> 38:49.369
We could even winter in Spain.

38:50.912 --> 38:53.915
You and the girls shall get
everything your hearts desire.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.710
Now... leave it all to me.

39:10.390 --> 39:12.141
Oh, for heaven's sake, Matthew!

39:12.225 --> 39:15.019
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

39:15.103 --> 39:18.731
It would seem Anne's dark imagination
is contagious.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.694
Well, now, what is it?

39:25.738 --> 39:30.952
We've only just settled up with the bank.
$150, that's quite a bit.

39:31.536 --> 39:34.372
And Mr. Dunlop,
his offer is a generous one,

39:34.455 --> 39:35.874
but it doesn't feel right...

39:36.916 --> 39:38.418
Dig up Green Gables?

39:39.085 --> 39:40.962
I mean, there might be gold.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.339
And if so, it'll keep.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.301
But I want us to give Anne a farm.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.678
And a whole one. She can...

39:48.761 --> 39:51.180
mine it after we're gone,

39:51.264 --> 39:52.974
if that's her decision.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.312
I agree entirely.

40:10.074 --> 40:12.035
Anne?

40:12.118 --> 40:16.331
Oh, Matthew, is it really you?
I thought for sure my end had come.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.291
Mm-hmm.

40:18.374 --> 40:20.251
I think it's time...

40:20.335 --> 40:22.503
you best be getting to sleep.

40:25.882 --> 40:27.592
You're safe here.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.510
I promise.

40:39.771 --> 40:42.106
Bash,
do you wanna talk about it?

40:43.149 --> 40:44.192
Bash.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.528
I know you're not asleep.
Your eyes are open.

40:49.656 --> 40:50.865
Sebastian?

40:51.991 --> 40:53.743
Your born name is Sebastian?

40:54.494 --> 40:56.412
Sounds like you should own this boat.

40:56.496 --> 40:59.082
And here I thought Bash meant
you like to rough a feller up.

40:59.165 --> 41:00.416
Good to know.

41:01.250 --> 41:05.171
You have ruined my reputation.
I could hit you two tap myself.

41:05.254 --> 41:07.423
There was this girl back in Avonlea.

41:08.257 --> 41:09.258
Anne.

41:09.342 --> 41:13.763
One time I called her "Carrots"
and she whacked me over the head.

41:13.846 --> 41:16.349
- I give her right on that.
- She's a redhead.

41:16.432 --> 41:20.144
- Fiery temper.
- She should've done more than whack you.

41:20.228 --> 41:21.980
Wonder if I'll ever see her again.

41:23.272 --> 41:25.650
How long you plannin'
to stay on this ship?

41:25.733 --> 41:26.859
I don't know.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.445
I want to go
wherever the spirit moves me.

41:31.030 --> 41:32.782
That's what my dad used to say.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.660
I feel like
we'll be crackin' coal forever.

41:36.911 --> 41:40.623
Like them pistons in the engine,
always going and going and going nowhere.

41:42.500 --> 41:43.876
I'm trapped here.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.337
I felt trapped in Avonlea.

41:47.672 --> 41:49.257
If I go back home,

41:49.340 --> 41:51.300
I may never be able to leave.

41:52.385 --> 41:54.637
Boy, you call that a problem?

41:55.847 --> 41:57.724
Some of us ain't have no home.

42:49.358 --> 42:50.860
Good morning, Jerry.

42:50.943 --> 42:52.361
Hello.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.157
Hello.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.865
No, no, no!
