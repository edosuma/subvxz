00:26.707 --> 00:27.823
What? Is that...

00:27.992 --> 00:30.859
Are you...
But how are all these Mort? Help!

00:31.819 --> 00:35.513
Maurice, there are Morts
here, there, and everywhere.

00:35.638 --> 00:36.853
I must be dreaming.

00:36.978 --> 00:39.267
The most horrible dream
inside my head.

00:39.941 --> 00:41.920
Quick, pinch me.
Now bite me.

00:42.045 --> 00:44.280
Now slap my face,
and spank my right buttock.

00:45.990 --> 00:46.908
Am I awake?

00:47.076 --> 00:49.711
They're the new stuffed Mort dolls
from the zoo gift shop.

00:50.580 --> 00:51.980
The kids just love 'em.

00:53.181 --> 00:56.534
Just look
at this silly Mort doll thing.

00:56.659 --> 01:00.388
It is the most ugliest
and stupidest...

01:01.122 --> 01:02.858
That's actually the real Mort.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.823
Hi, it's me.

01:07.664 --> 01:09.910
Very well.
Onto new business.

01:10.035 --> 01:12.399
Please refrain
from yanking the hats off visitors

01:12.568 --> 01:15.037
when they stroll past your habitats.

01:15.380 --> 01:18.406
There are legal issues,
and more importantly,

01:18.531 --> 01:19.941
it's just plain rude.

01:21.493 --> 01:23.804
Of course,
we can still fling poo at them.

01:24.253 --> 01:25.577
That's tradition.

01:27.442 --> 01:29.384
Those new Mort dolls sure are cute.

01:29.670 --> 01:32.140
I would go so far as to call them

01:32.265 --> 01:34.089
downright adorable, Marlene.

01:35.198 --> 01:37.492
The more of me, the merrier!

01:39.846 --> 01:42.209
Come on, cheer up.
At least you have a toy.

01:42.448 --> 01:45.351
The last shipment of otter dolls
was sent back to the factory.

01:46.258 --> 01:47.903
Sent back, you are saying?

01:48.173 --> 01:51.053
Well, they did have a few...
I don't know...

01:51.178 --> 01:52.440
Minor defects.

01:55.483 --> 01:56.491
Defects?

01:58.266 --> 01:59.940
Now, there is an idea.

02:06.389 --> 02:07.722
What's up with the fuss?

02:07.890 --> 02:08.808
I dunno.

02:08.933 --> 02:11.037
I have to wait
for my away team to report

02:11.162 --> 02:13.093
before declaring "Defcom Red".

02:14.397 --> 02:16.898
Real quick,
what exactly is a "Defcom Red"?

02:17.196 --> 02:18.179
Classified.

02:18.304 --> 02:21.236
Just hope you never live
to see one, sister.

02:22.112 --> 02:24.506
Skipper, reports indicate
that the new Mort plushes

02:24.674 --> 02:27.409
are tainted
with some sort of toxic substance.

02:27.577 --> 02:30.111
They're recalling the whole inventory
back to the factory.

02:30.279 --> 02:32.097
A factory recall?

02:32.749 --> 02:33.882
Wait a second.

02:34.825 --> 02:35.717
It's Alice.

02:37.283 --> 02:39.324
No wonder
they're sending these things back.

02:46.412 --> 02:47.529
Skipper, look.

02:48.404 --> 02:51.732
No, that's me in there. I like me.
Bring me back. I fall!

02:52.310 --> 02:53.101
Sad eyes.

02:54.457 --> 02:56.338
Why do the other me stink?

03:01.696 --> 03:03.879
It was you, wasn't it?

03:05.037 --> 03:06.531
No, of course not.

03:06.656 --> 03:09.351
How daring of you!
Wait, what do you mean?

03:10.987 --> 03:12.677
What did you do to the Mort dolls?

03:12.802 --> 03:13.822
I am certain

03:13.990 --> 03:16.158
I must not have the slightly,

03:16.326 --> 03:19.903
foggiest idea
of what you are speaking of.

03:28.998 --> 03:31.873
Have at them,
my foul black and white friends.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.237
Yes!
Spray away!

03:34.514 --> 03:37.200
You there, go, go!

03:37.642 --> 03:39.042
You missed a spot.

03:45.814 --> 03:46.893
Fine.

03:47.195 --> 03:48.531
I was maybe

03:48.656 --> 03:51.658
indirectly responsible,
in a way that's not my fault

03:51.966 --> 03:54.331
for the recalling
of the annoying Mort dolls.

03:54.456 --> 03:55.530
Who is caring?

03:55.999 --> 03:58.104
- Mort.
- The real Mort.

03:58.229 --> 04:01.436
The one that was taken along
with his stuffed toys.

04:02.944 --> 04:06.336
Stop.
Stop with the being so ridiculous.

04:06.461 --> 04:09.588
The real Mort is right here,
safe and soundly.

04:09.713 --> 04:11.227
Isn't that right, Mort?

04:12.991 --> 04:15.484
Well, can't we just keep this one
instead?

04:15.903 --> 04:17.733
Somebody has to go after him.

04:17.944 --> 04:19.945
Don't worry.
This is what we do.

04:23.148 --> 04:24.632
What have I done?

04:25.194 --> 04:28.421
I already miss
having that annoying Mort around

04:28.546 --> 04:30.098
so that I can hate him.

04:35.038 --> 04:37.372
We have a confirmed address
on the target.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.241
Now some transport.

04:40.977 --> 04:44.246
I told Harry, that I'm gonna
write him up, next time he's late.

04:45.007 --> 04:46.248
I know everything

04:46.416 --> 04:48.878
that goes on around here.
Everything.

04:56.574 --> 04:58.339
- Kowalski, report.
- It's dark.

04:58.629 --> 05:01.251
I concur.
Rico, weapons check.

05:02.964 --> 05:05.381
Outstanding.
Private, sound off.

05:06.430 --> 05:09.683
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet, Private. Wait for it.

05:10.042 --> 05:11.412
Wait for it.

05:11.782 --> 05:14.075
And...
Move out.

05:14.243 --> 05:14.983
Now!

05:17.020 --> 05:19.003
Right.
Back in the box.

05:20.645 --> 05:21.804
Any word on the rescue?

05:22.189 --> 05:23.885
We have a delivery confirmation.

05:24.202 --> 05:26.506
Skipper and company
were delivered to the factory

05:26.631 --> 05:28.868
at exactly 7:30 A.M.

05:29.335 --> 05:30.795
Eastern standard time.

05:31.060 --> 05:33.696
Signed for by a C.W. Smith.

05:35.665 --> 05:36.902
Get him out of sight.

05:37.487 --> 05:39.334
Have you by passed
the security scanner yet?

05:39.916 --> 05:42.660
I can't seem to crack
the retinal scrambling code.

05:44.807 --> 05:47.776
Keep at it. Mort's here somewhere.
And he's counting on us.

06:01.991 --> 06:05.240
Switching to collate on my mark.

06:05.662 --> 06:07.307
Five, four, three.

06:09.832 --> 06:11.867
Evasive action.
Do we have enemy movement?

06:13.184 --> 06:14.469
We're taking fire!

06:14.793 --> 06:17.139
We're also giving some, right, Rico?

06:19.891 --> 06:23.208
Steady, boys.
Stand by to toast this marshmallow.

06:25.015 --> 06:27.182
Popcorn, anyone?
It's fresh.

06:28.086 --> 06:29.237
How did he get here?

06:29.890 --> 06:30.910
I sent myself

06:31.035 --> 06:33.629
super-platinum
premier overnight express.

06:33.848 --> 06:35.524
This is how a king is to be rolling.

06:35.692 --> 06:38.326
But you're the reason
Mort's here in the first place.

06:38.495 --> 06:42.398
Which is why I must lend
my kingly cleverness to help.

06:42.683 --> 06:46.408
So who enjoys the honor
of carrying my luggage?

06:47.614 --> 06:49.496
Stamp his royal highness

06:49.700 --> 06:51.450
return to sender.

06:55.595 --> 06:57.594
You win.
Forget the luggage.

06:58.181 --> 07:01.018
Skipper, we could use
an extra set of eyes

07:01.143 --> 07:02.784
to cover our left flank.

07:05.348 --> 07:07.422
All right, Ringtail.
You're in.

07:08.953 --> 07:11.554
Ringtail.
Is this my code name?

07:33.849 --> 07:35.701
Sweet mother MacArthur!

07:35.826 --> 07:37.719
Will you just take
a look opposition?

07:38.254 --> 07:40.268
Why did you not just say so?

07:43.526 --> 07:46.795
<i>Defective items scheduled
for immediate destruction.</i>

07:49.537 --> 07:51.146
Somebody help me!

07:57.507 --> 07:58.872
This crown is all wrong.

07:59.116 --> 08:02.363
My noble kingly nose
is looking too big here.

08:02.745 --> 08:05.301
Where is the quality controlling
in this dump?

08:19.735 --> 08:20.485
What?

08:20.925 --> 08:24.393
You are now officially
a hazard to this operation.

08:26.671 --> 08:28.168
Double time it, boys.

08:28.610 --> 08:30.653
Just stay out of sight, Ringtail.

08:38.779 --> 08:40.248
Kowalski, hit the kill switch.

08:42.986 --> 08:44.229
Kill the hit switch!

08:45.147 --> 08:46.411
Switch the kill hit!

08:50.150 --> 08:52.503
Danger. Danger.

09:00.803 --> 09:02.511
What kind of sick and

09:02.636 --> 09:05.207
twisted toy factory is this?

09:05.942 --> 09:08.310
Hang on.
I'm going to by pass the central wire...

09:33.956 --> 09:35.437
Rico, surprise me.

09:43.192 --> 09:44.627
Last words, anyone?

09:49.277 --> 09:51.301
Ringtail to the rescue!

09:52.288 --> 09:54.044
No need to drop to your knees

09:54.169 --> 09:55.869
to thank and worship me.

10:06.674 --> 10:07.869
We're safe!

10:10.656 --> 10:12.707
And so, as of tonight,

10:13.042 --> 10:16.153
there's been no word
from the penguins or Julien

10:16.573 --> 10:19.214
concerning their valiant efforts
to rescue Mort.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.515
I'm afraid
we'll have to assume the worst.

10:27.760 --> 10:29.290
You guys made it!

10:29.459 --> 10:31.259
And Mort!
He's home!

10:37.086 --> 10:40.202
I am so happy to have my kingdom
together again.

10:40.703 --> 10:43.305
Mort, you are free
to resume worshiping me.

10:43.558 --> 10:46.141
There's no place like home.

10:46.309 --> 10:48.804
Check it out.
The zoo has a new bestseller.

10:49.412 --> 10:51.148
Well, would you look at that.

10:51.379 --> 10:52.629
Kudos, Private.

10:57.571 --> 10:58.840
Anybody?
