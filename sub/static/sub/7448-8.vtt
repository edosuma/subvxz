These are the ones
who killed Terry Falconer.

00:30.727 --> 00:33.127
- That's Anthony Perish.
- Who's been talking?

00:33.127 --> 00:36.087
Anthony Perish hasn't ever
had an account with Telstra.

00:36.087 --> 00:38.567
He's not registered with
the housing commission, Medicare

00:38.567 --> 00:40.047

no traffic infringements,

the importance of our Informant X.

01:11.527 --> 01:13.007

01:13.007 --> 01:15.047

he's given us a statement.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.287
the week leading up
to the abduction,

12:43.287 --> 12:45.721
then nothing, zilch.

12:47.727 --> 12:50.639
You 're happy. This is good.

12:53.687 --> 12:55.962
I know you 're sick, Camille.

12:57.487 --> 12:59.487
I can't pretend
to know how you feel

12:59.487 --> 13:02.320
but this is... a shit of a job.

13:05.287 --> 13:07.407
Why don't you just
take it easy? Go home?

13:07.407 --> 13:09.967
And do what?

13:09.967 --> 13:13.047
This... shit of a job

13:13.047 --> 13:16.287
is the most meaningful
police work I've ever done.

13:16.287 --> 13:19.279
I wanna see it through,
just like you.

13:23.487 --> 13:26.167
People already think
I'm a slave driver.

13:26.167 --> 13:28.967
They're gonna think
I'm a real prick.

13:28.967 --> 13:30.958
(LAUGHS)

13:33.887 --> 13:36.276
Stay as long as you want.

13:37.727 --> 13:40.407
Thank you.

13:40.407 --> 13:42.398
(RACY MUSIC)

13:54.567 --> 13:58.367
Frank. It's just like old times
with you in the back there.

13:58.367 --> 14:01.643
Yeah. Only this time
I don't have me popgun, hey?

14:04.287 --> 14:06.084
Let's get those crooks.

14:10.207 --> 14:12.163
Window doesn't even open, eh.

14:13.847 --> 14:15.927
Hey, Frank.

14:15.927 --> 14:18.007
How am I supposed
to sleep knowing Browney

14:18.007 --> 14:20.007
is in the next room, huh?

14:20.007 --> 14:22.447
Could be sleeping nude
for all I know.

14:22.447 --> 14:24.567
Honestly...

14:24.567 --> 14:27.607
I've never felt
so claustrophobic, eh.

14:27.607 --> 14:29.567
You wait till you get
in the witness box.

14:29.567 --> 14:32.843
Can we at least go out
for a feed, huh?

14:34.207 --> 14:35.687
Oh, that's not fair.

14:35.687 --> 14:38.167
You get to go home to your family,
I'm stuck here by...

14:38.167 --> 14:41.127
Frank, just sit down, will you?
Just try and relax.

14:41.127 --> 14:43.367
We'll make a call.
We'll get something brought up.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.607
Jesus Christ, you 're
making me nervous. Sit down.

14:45.607 --> 14:48.767
Just... (EXHALES LOUDLY)

14:48.767 --> 14:50.807
Alright, just breathe.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.767
That is shit as, Gary, huh?
That is shit as.

14:54.767 --> 14:57.527
Come on. I'll behave, mate.

14:57.527 --> 15:00.447
Time for you to throw
some coin on the bar, eh.

15:00.447 --> 15:02.207
Come on, Gazza, you old woman.

15:02.207 --> 15:04.967
Don't call me Gazza, Frank.
Fuck.

15:04.967 --> 15:08.047
How does a bloke your size
get away with eating lettuce?

15:08.047 --> 15:10.087
Same way the silverback gorilla
does, mate.

15:10.087 --> 15:13.124
Eat a truckload.
In my case, maybe two.

15:16.247 --> 15:20.327
(LAUGHS) Oh, no.
See that bloke over there?

15:20.327 --> 15:22.287
Hm?

15:22.287 --> 15:25.167
He's not too happy about me
eyeing off his missus, eh.

15:25.167 --> 15:27.840
You just can't fucking
help yourself, can you?

15:29.567 --> 15:32.007
You wanna know how to survive
a beatin' with a table leg?

15:32.007 --> 15:34.167
Yeah.

15:34.167 --> 15:36.287
Say you 've slept with
your mate's missus, right?

15:36.287 --> 15:38.167
Now, if you 're a useful member,

15:38.167 --> 15:39.887
you 're not gonna get killed
or nothin', right.

15:39.887 --> 15:42.047
But there has to be
some kind of retribution.

15:42.047 --> 15:43.687
I mean, fair's fair, yeah?

15:43.687 --> 15:45.527
How?

15:45.527 --> 15:49.407
You lay facedown,
flat on the ground, right.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.927
- And that's it?
- You cover your head, Einstein.

15:51.927 --> 15:54.487
If you 're sure they're not
out to kill, that's your best bet.

15:54.487 --> 15:57.087
Sounds like
how you survive a bear attack.

15:57.087 --> 15:59.927
Hm. Bears. Bikies.

15:59.927 --> 16:01.997
(PHONE RINGS)

16:03.607 --> 16:05.327
I've gotta take this.

16:05.327 --> 16:08.287
- Did you get my message?
- Gary.

16:08.287 --> 16:10.767
I fly to Darwin
first thing in the morning.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.327
This is the last night
we had together for a while.

16:13.327 --> 16:16.607
Alright. I'm leaving.
OK. I'm on my way.

16:16.607 --> 16:18.598
(DOOR CLOSES)

16:21.487 --> 16:24.001
Packing a bit for two days,
aren't you?

16:25.887 --> 16:28.567
(SIGHS)

16:28.567 --> 16:30.247
What?

16:30.247 --> 16:32.567
Gaz, I'm hardly seeing you.

16:32.567 --> 16:35.007
The hours you 're doing
on this are insane

16:35.007 --> 16:37.167
and the trial
hasn't even started yet.

16:37.167 --> 16:41.087
And, what? Me, running the company
from the kitchen table?

16:41.087 --> 16:43.967
Jesus Christ, Tracy. You were
just talking about marriage.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.167
Now you 're just gonna?
You 're pissing off.

16:46.167 --> 16:48.687
I'm not breaking up, you goose.

16:48.687 --> 16:51.360
Oh. Hey.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.525
I'll still visit once a month.

17:00.327 --> 17:03.205
I can't let you
give up on this case.

17:10.527 --> 17:12.915
I love you, Trace.

17:14.527 --> 17:17.166
Enough to drive me to
the airport in the morning?

17:17.166 --> 17:19.442
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

17:27.127 --> 17:28.927
JACQUI JAMES: June 2010

17:28.927 --> 17:32.927
and Anthony, Andrew and Muzz
face their committal hearing.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.887
The question at hand -

17:34.887 --> 17:37.847
had Strike Force Tuno
built a strong enough case

17:37.847 --> 17:40.361
to put them on trial for murder?

17:46.967 --> 17:50.127
The three accused men
hadn't seen or spoken to each other

17:50.127 --> 17:51.924
since their arrests
18 months before.

17:54.167 --> 17:56.158
(DOOR OPENS)

17:57.407 --> 17:59.087
It was also the first time

17:59.087 --> 18:00.847
Anthony had clapped eyes
on Decker

18:00.847 --> 18:04.407
since he had turned
crown witness.

18:04.407 --> 18:06.398
(TENSE MUSIC)

18:09.327 --> 18:12.727
I heard he got a 50% discount
on his sentence.

18:12.727 --> 18:14.607
(CHUCKLES)

18:14.607 --> 18:17.927
How long did it take
to drive to Girvan?

18:17.927 --> 18:21.767
A long time.
Maybe two to three hours.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.207
When Anthony joined you
and Mr Lawton later

18:25.207 --> 18:28.607
and the box was opened,
was Mr Falconer alive?

18:28.607 --> 18:30.087
No.

18:30.087 --> 18:31.727
But he was alive

18:31.727 --> 18:34.607
when Anthony closed the toolbox
at Turramurra?

18:34.607 --> 18:38.647
Yes. He was groggy
but he was alive.

18:38.647 --> 18:41.847
He has to say that. Otherwise
he'd be sitting here with us.

18:41.847 --> 18:44.367
Do you swear to tell the truth,

18:44.367 --> 18:46.847
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

18:46.847 --> 18:50.635
- Please say, "I do."
- I do.

18:52.007 --> 18:56.447
Yeah, Anthony said to come up
the Karuah River at Bulahdelah.

18:56.447 --> 18:58.047
Uh, he'd be waiting there

18:58.047 --> 18:59.687
dressed like a fisherman
with a few eskies.

18:59.687 --> 19:02.607
Because the prick might be
in a few pieces, see?

19:02.607 --> 19:06.487
And, after the discussion
of fixing your boat had ended,

19:06.487 --> 19:08.647
Anthony mentioned
Terry Falconer?

19:08.647 --> 19:11.247
He said he'd heard a rumour
that I'd been told in jail

19:11.247 --> 19:13.807
that Terry Falconer
murdered his grandparents.

19:13.807 --> 19:15.887
Another call to Gary Jubelin
where you alleged

19:15.887 --> 19:18.647
that a helicopter
was hovering over your house.

19:18.647 --> 19:20.607
It was square-lappin'
the perimeter, correct.

19:20.607 --> 19:22.087
You actually believe
the helicopters

19:22.087 --> 19:23.607
were following you
around Sydney?

19:23.607 --> 19:25.567
Correct, again.
The heat was on.

19:25.567 --> 19:27.527
And the Jatz crackers
in your swimming pool.

19:27.527 --> 19:29.247
That too you interpreted
as a threat?

19:29.247 --> 19:32.007
Someone had been in my house
and put it there.

19:32.007 --> 19:33.967
Also correct.

19:33.967 --> 19:35.647
What are you eating?

19:35.647 --> 19:37.567
A mint.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.797
You 're giving evidence,
you realise?

19:44.527 --> 19:46.607
JACQUI JAMES:
Holding up threatening signs

19:46.607 --> 19:49.687
did nothing to damage
the strength of Tuno's brief.

19:49.687 --> 19:51.405
Threatening the witness.

19:53.327 --> 19:56.207
JACQUI JAMES:
Anthony, his brother and his mate

19:56.207 --> 19:59.404
were committed to trial
for the murder of Terry Falconer.

20:00.567 --> 20:02.127
The problem with the autopsy

20:02.127 --> 20:04.687
is we can't prove
the act causing death.

20:04.687 --> 20:07.927
Was it the closing of the lid?
Punches at Turramurra?

20:07.927 --> 20:10.127
I thought it didn't matter
when exactly Terry Falconer died

20:10.127 --> 20:12.167
if we could prove
intent to kill, which we can,

20:12.167 --> 20:13.647
given Frank O'Rourke's evidence.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.647
Hanging a murder conviction
on the word of a man

20:15.647 --> 20:17.407
who cowers at the sight
of Jatz crackers?

20:17.407 --> 20:20.087
That's not just Frank. Decker's
evidence goes to premeditation.

20:20.087 --> 20:22.567
Hardly - Decker makes out
like the whole thing

20:22.567 --> 20:24.607
was an accident
and he just helped clean it up.

20:24.607 --> 20:26.607
What does he actually add
to the murder charge?

20:26.607 --> 20:30.047
We got the hacksaws. We got
the disposable suits at Girvan.

20:30.047 --> 20:32.927
He said they were already there.
It doesn't matter how he died.

20:32.927 --> 20:34.407
They were always gonna kill him.

20:34.407 --> 20:37.407
I'm no longer confident we'll win
if we pursue murder.

20:37.407 --> 20:39.287
The safer course
is to offer Anthony

20:39.287 --> 20:40.847
the lesser charge
of manslaughter.

20:40.847 --> 20:44.047
He pleads guilty to that,
we skip the trial altogether.

20:44.047 --> 20:46.967
Fuck that, and I'll tell you why.

20:46.967 --> 20:49.447
I haven't chased this prick
for the last nine years

20:49.447 --> 20:51.527
just to lock him up
for manslaughter for six.

20:51.527 --> 20:54.367
OK, he'll wear that
like a badge on his chest.

20:54.367 --> 20:56.207
Manslaughter also means
Andrew walks.

20:56.207 --> 20:57.767
There's no conspiracy
to an accidental death

20:57.767 --> 21:00.047
and we forfeit the conspiracy
charges on Anthony and Muzz.

21:00.047 --> 21:01.647
It completely
ignores Frank's evidence.

21:01.647 --> 21:03.727
Right, you might say
he's crazy, but this guy

21:03.727 --> 21:06.327
has laid his life on the line
for us because we said

21:06.327 --> 21:08.127
we were going
after Perish for murder,

21:08.127 --> 21:09.767
not fucking manslaughter.

21:09.767 --> 21:12.367
All our witnesses have laid
their lives on the line for us,

21:12.367 --> 21:14.327
so we're not backing down.

21:14.327 --> 21:16.287
Gary, would you rather
pursue murder

21:16.287 --> 21:18.767
and see them all get off,
or do you wanna make certain

21:18.767 --> 21:20.723
that you 're putting Anthony
away for something?

21:22.647 --> 21:24.167
JACQUI JAMES:
Despite strong evidence

21:24.167 --> 21:26.927
pointing to Terry Falconer's
murder being planned,

21:26.927 --> 21:29.407
the Crown Prosecutor
commenced negotiations

21:29.407 --> 21:31.167
with Anthony Perish's lawyers

21:31.167 --> 21:33.967
to have him plead guilty
to manslaughter.

21:33.967 --> 21:37.567
So your lawyer said
that if Anthony pleads guilty,

21:37.567 --> 21:39.767
they'll drop your charge
altogether.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.847
Well, that's just
fuckin' marvellous, isn't it?

21:41.847 --> 21:43.447
But is he gonna do it?

21:43.447 --> 21:47.407
I haven't exactly had a chance
to talk to him, have I?

21:47.407 --> 21:51.764
He'll do it for you, babe.
I know he will.

21:54.047 --> 21:56.887
You 've got no criminal record.
You could be out in under 10.

21:56.887 --> 21:59.607
My best advice
is to take the Crown's offer.

21:59.607 --> 22:01.127
Plead guilty to manslaughter.

22:01.127 --> 22:03.527
But if we go to trial,
I could get off completely, right?

22:03.527 --> 22:05.847
I mean, the circumstantial case,
the shoddy witnesses.

22:05.847 --> 22:09.362
Anthony, look, this is
the best possible scenario.

22:11.927 --> 22:15.522
You know, 'guilty' is not a word
that comes easily to me.

22:17.847 --> 22:20.287
JACQUI JAMES: Anthony knew
the longer he sat in prison,

22:20.287 --> 22:23.367
the more vulnerable
the company's business became.

22:23.367 --> 22:25.447
People on the outside
were jockeying

22:25.447 --> 22:27.278
to take over his share
of the drug market.

22:28.647 --> 22:31.525
He needed to get out...
whatever it took.

22:35.167 --> 22:37.556
All silent. Please stand.

22:58.567 --> 23:02.401
Anthony John Michael Perish,
will you please stand?

23:06.927 --> 23:10.887
Anthony Perish,
you stand indicted for murder

23:10.887 --> 23:14.087
in that between
the 16th of November 2001

23:14.087 --> 23:17.127
and 26th of November 2001

23:17.127 --> 23:19.727
in Sydney, in the state
of New South Wales,

23:19.727 --> 23:22.047
you did murder Terry Falconer.

23:22.047 --> 23:26.047
How say you?
Are you guilty or not guilty?

23:26.047 --> 23:27.526
Not guilty.

23:30.207 --> 23:31.959
But I plead to manslaughter.

23:36.087 --> 23:38.476
Mr Crown,
do you accept the plea?

23:40.927 --> 23:42.887
- Mr Crown?
- Are you OK?

23:42.887 --> 23:44.647
Alright, sit back.

23:44.647 --> 23:46.647
Your Honour, I think
we need to call an ambulance.

23:46.647 --> 23:47.647
Merv...

23:47.647 --> 23:50.487
JACQUI JAMES: Merv Grogan
survived his heart attack

23:50.487 --> 23:51.967
but the trial would be delayed

23:51.967 --> 23:54.367
so that another Crown prosecutor
could be briefed,

23:54.367 --> 23:56.727
a younger, less experienced man.

23:56.727 --> 23:58.567
JUBELIN: So has the new Crown
read the brief?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.807
WOMAN: Mm-hm. Over the weekend.

24:00.807 --> 24:02.607
He just won a home invasion.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.247
Great. A home invasion.

24:05.247 --> 24:07.283
Well, he won convincingly.

24:27.047 --> 24:30.039
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

24:46.487 --> 24:48.767
JACQUI JAMES:
Camille Grace Alavoine

24:48.767 --> 24:52.727
passed away
on Sunday, 13 March 2011.

24:52.727 --> 24:55.207
Her dream of seeing
Gary Jubelin and Tim Browne

24:55.207 --> 24:57.447
deliver justice to
Terry Falconer's family

24:57.447 --> 24:59.005
was not to be.

25:03.127 --> 25:04.606
So when's the funeral?

25:06.647 --> 25:08.160
She didn't believe in them.

25:09.647 --> 25:12.764
She left us some money
for drinks after the trial.

25:18.127 --> 25:21.324
It's... it's not fair, Browney.

25:23.247 --> 25:24.965
I know.

25:29.727 --> 25:31.319
We're gonna get these pricks.

25:38.567 --> 25:41.247
He's fairly eccentric,
so look out for that,

25:41.247 --> 25:43.727
but he's really, really good -
here he is.

25:43.727 --> 25:46.327
- Paul.
- Paul Leask, Crown prosecutor.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.207
When have you seen
a case like this, eh?

25:48.207 --> 25:49.807
I mean, though
it's terribly complex,

25:49.807 --> 25:51.527
one thing is
indisputably clear -

25:51.527 --> 25:53.407
Terry Falconer was never
going back to Silverwater.

25:53.407 --> 25:54.887
Never.
Never, never, never, never.

25:54.887 --> 25:56.887
No, this is murder,
if I ever did see it.

25:56.887 --> 25:58.367
But don't you just love
the irony?

25:58.367 --> 25:59.727
All the fastidiousness with

25:59.727 --> 26:01.207
trying to eliminate
the evidence.

26:01.207 --> 26:03.887
Use ammonia - it fucks the DNA.
He didn't even know the tides.

26:03.887 --> 26:05.487
He may as well have
thrown the evidence

26:05.487 --> 26:06.967
in someone's pool - unbelievable.

26:06.967 --> 26:09.925
Paul Alexander Leask,
sit down, shut up and listen.

26:11.487 --> 26:15.567
Alright, well, before your
predecessor had a heart attack,

26:15.567 --> 26:17.567
he negotiated pleas
for manslaughter.

26:17.567 --> 26:19.607
Oh, no. No, we won't
be doing that.

26:19.607 --> 26:21.887
Manslaughter's
completely incongruous

26:21.887 --> 26:23.647
with O'Rourke's evidence.

26:23.647 --> 26:25.567
(PHONE RINGS)

26:25.567 --> 26:27.287
You 're not fucking with us,
are you, Paul?

26:27.287 --> 26:29.007
ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello.
You 've reached Paul Leask.

26:29.007 --> 26:30.687
Leave that. That's OK.
No.

26:30.687 --> 26:32.287
No, this is murder -
plain and simple.

26:32.287 --> 26:34.447
WOMAN ON PHONE: Paul,
the defence will rip you apart.

26:34.447 --> 26:36.127
Take the pleas
or you 're gonna lose it.

26:36.127 --> 26:38.047
(HANGS UP)

26:38.047 --> 26:39.844
Happens all the time.

26:49.727 --> 26:51.767
JACQUI JAMES:
Almost a decade had passed

26:51.767 --> 26:53.767
since the murder
of Terry Falconer.

26:53.767 --> 26:57.840
Anthony Perish was about to be held
to account for his crimes.

27:01.727 --> 27:04.767
PAUL:
On the 16th of November 2001,

27:04.767 --> 27:06.527
ladies and gentlemen,

27:06.527 --> 27:09.647
six bags were discovered
in the Hastings River.

27:09.647 --> 27:12.923
Each contained the remains
of a human being...

27:14.127 --> 27:15.927
...Terrence Falconer.

27:15.927 --> 27:19.727
Anthony Perish pleaded guilty
to his manslaughter,

27:19.727 --> 27:21.887
but the Crown
does not accept this plea.

27:21.887 --> 27:23.447
No.

27:23.447 --> 27:26.327
This case is one of murder.

27:26.327 --> 27:28.847
DEFENCE LAWYER: In June 1993,

27:28.847 --> 27:32.407
Anthony and Frances Perish
were found dead

27:32.407 --> 27:34.807
in their farmhouse
in Leppington.

27:34.807 --> 27:39.407
Who killed them and why
remains a mystery.

27:39.407 --> 27:41.647
Anthony spoke about
his grandparents' deaths

27:41.647 --> 27:44.287
with a man called Brett Simpson,
a go-to man.

27:44.287 --> 27:48.247
He suggested that he
could bring Mr Falconer

27:48.247 --> 27:50.287
to Anthony for questioning.

27:50.287 --> 27:55.487
But Terry Falconer was dead
when the box was opened.

27:55.487 --> 27:57.007
Anthony panicked.

27:57.007 --> 27:59.887
He could no longer question
Terry Falconer.

27:59.887 --> 28:04.167
There's no disputing
the body was dismembered.

28:04.167 --> 28:05.847
He wanted to hide
his involvement.

28:05.847 --> 28:08.202
If you 'd been in
the same situation...

28:09.247 --> 28:11.044
...who knows what
you might have done?

28:12.127 --> 28:16.327
LEASK: Bag four contained
an upper arm and two shins.

28:16.327 --> 28:17.607
MAN: That's correct.

28:17.607 --> 28:22.367
Bag five -
a half pelvis and a thigh.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.247
Yes, correct.

28:24.247 --> 28:28.407
Now, when those pieces
were put back together

28:28.407 --> 28:30.887
to reconstruct the man,
as it were,

28:30.887 --> 28:32.807
was there anything missing?

28:32.807 --> 28:35.807
Yes. The body had
been eviscerated.

28:35.807 --> 28:40.967
So the stomach, the heart,
the lungs, kidneys, liver, spleen

28:40.967 --> 28:42.447
were all missing.

28:42.447 --> 28:44.927
And the head had been
separated from the torso.

28:44.927 --> 28:46.407
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

28:46.407 --> 28:47.887
And the jaw was missing?

28:47.887 --> 28:50.007
Yes, the lower mandible
was absent.

28:50.007 --> 28:53.367
Professor, how exactly is
the jaw connected to the skull?

28:53.367 --> 28:57.167
Just at the
temporomandibular joint - here.

28:57.167 --> 29:01.167
So would you have to
cut through the joint?

29:01.167 --> 29:02.847
Yes, you 'd either cut the joint

29:02.847 --> 29:05.607
or cut through the bone
of this area.

29:05.607 --> 29:10.007
But to remove it,
would you have to remove the skin?

29:10.007 --> 29:14.167
Yes, you 'd have to reflect the skin
off the mandible first,

29:14.167 --> 29:15.647
then remove the mandible.

29:15.647 --> 29:17.327
Of course, because you have
a joint either side...

29:17.327 --> 29:19.047
Objection, Your Honour.

29:19.047 --> 29:20.765
I won't press.

29:26.687 --> 29:29.087
JACQUI JAMES: Brett Simpson,
also known as Decker,

29:29.087 --> 29:31.527
had been sentenced to
a minimum of 15 years

29:31.527 --> 29:34.247
for his part in the kidnapping
of Terry Falconer,

29:34.247 --> 29:35.847
the disposal of his body,

29:35.847 --> 29:38.727
plus numerous other
violent crimes.

29:38.727 --> 29:41.767
He refused to change into a suit
to give evidence,

29:41.767 --> 29:45.077
wearing his prison coveralls
like a badge of honour.

29:46.087 --> 29:49.167
Do you recall discussing
the murder of Terry Falconer

29:49.167 --> 29:52.876
with Ben Dokic at a cafe
in Lavender Bay?

29:57.087 --> 29:58.884
I can't recall.

30:02.647 --> 30:04.247
You weren't to know this
at the time,

30:04.247 --> 30:06.966
but an external agency
had bugged Dokic's phone.

30:09.287 --> 30:13.847
I'll play you a tape
to jog your memory.

30:13.847 --> 30:15.367
- Ben Dokic.
- Hey, you bastard.

30:15.367 --> 30:17.517
- Hello.
- It's Decker!

30:19.287 --> 30:21.287
- G'day, mate. How are you?
- Hey.

30:21.287 --> 30:24.324
Come down to Lavender Bay Cafe.

30:25.927 --> 30:27.407
I'm here.

30:27.407 --> 30:29.637
Oh! You 're there, are you?

30:31.767 --> 30:34.122
Does this refresh your memory?

30:35.247 --> 30:37.602
Sounded like my voice, but...

30:38.767 --> 30:40.247
...I don't recall the meeting.

30:40.247 --> 30:42.247
Do you recall
who else was there?

30:42.247 --> 30:44.363
I assume Anthony, but...

30:45.487 --> 30:48.487
...I don't actually remember it.

30:48.487 --> 30:50.367
Well, what do you remember?

30:50.367 --> 30:53.484
It was either Matthew
or Anthony.

30:56.207 --> 30:57.727
I don't recall.

30:57.727 --> 30:59.399
I don't remember.

31:02.727 --> 31:05.878
I... I couldn't say who said that.

31:07.327 --> 31:08.647
What is it?

31:08.647 --> 31:10.847
Decker's feigning memory loss.
He's completely backflipped.

31:10.847 --> 31:13.247
LEASK: Well, the judge can see
it's not a genuine attempt.

31:13.247 --> 31:14.927
It's the jury
we've gotta worry about.

31:14.927 --> 31:15.967
Mm-hm.

31:15.967 --> 31:17.607
Fuck it, we'll just show
the walk-through.

31:17.607 --> 31:20.887
Don't you just love Section 38?

31:20.887 --> 31:22.479
- Uh-uh-uh!
- Oh.

31:23.887 --> 31:28.047
You were arrested on
the 19th of January in 2009.

31:28.047 --> 31:29.924
Do you remember your arrest?

31:30.927 --> 31:32.407
Parts of it.

31:32.407 --> 31:34.927
Do you remember conducting
a walk-through with police

31:34.927 --> 31:37.202
at Girvan after your arrest?

31:39.567 --> 31:41.285
I don't know.

31:45.967 --> 31:47.487
(MACHINE BEEPS)

31:47.487 --> 31:49.807
(ON TAPE) They rigged him up
to the block and tackle.

31:49.807 --> 31:54.562
Anthony throws a suit at me,
says "Get this on."

31:58.527 --> 32:01.007
The larger parts were
cut into smaller parts.

32:01.007 --> 32:04.847
And... I participated.

32:04.847 --> 32:06.803
I had to.

32:08.687 --> 32:13.567
At one point, Anthony looks at me.
I'm feeling crook.

32:13.567 --> 32:18.960
And he says, "What? Is this
the first time you 've done this?"

32:39.807 --> 32:42.527
If I were to get knocked,

32:42.527 --> 32:44.447
you can still use my evidence?

32:44.447 --> 32:46.278
Yes.

32:49.047 --> 32:52.039
Now, I'm trusting you
with my life, Gary.

32:54.247 --> 32:56.967
So I need you
to give me something.

32:56.967 --> 32:59.606
I need you to give me
your home address.

33:03.527 --> 33:06.447
One day, Gary, I'll have
my life taken for this, eh.

33:06.447 --> 33:09.120
And there's no doubting that.

33:10.287 --> 33:13.127
I've got a policy of not
handing out my home address.

33:13.127 --> 33:15.527
I have a policy of not setting foot
inside a courtroom.

33:15.527 --> 33:17.006
You know, that's my policy.

33:38.927 --> 33:41.316
I don't want any fucking gangsters
coming here, Frank.

33:53.087 --> 33:54.887
You 're lucky you did that, eh.

33:54.887 --> 33:57.196
Or I wasn't going through
with this.

34:03.247 --> 34:05.367
Anthony wanted me
to take the boat

34:05.367 --> 34:07.007
out past the continental shelf,

34:07.007 --> 34:08.927
find a hole with
the depth sounder,

34:08.927 --> 34:10.407
dump the eskies,

34:10.407 --> 34:13.206
on my way back,
wash the boat out with ammonia.

34:13.206 --> 34:17.127
Did Anthony explain
why you would use ammonia?

34:17.127 --> 34:19.407
Yeah. He said it fucks the DNA.

34:19.407 --> 34:21.367
They can tell
there's been blood

34:21.367 --> 34:23.167
but they can't tell whose.

34:23.167 --> 34:26.607
The following year, you agreed to
commence a police operation

34:26.607 --> 34:28.567
that involved you wearing
a listening device

34:28.567 --> 34:30.087
to meetings with Andrew Perish.

34:30.087 --> 34:31.600
That is correct.

34:34.047 --> 34:35.887
- (MACHINE BEEPS)
- (ON TAPE) Just one more thing.

34:35.887 --> 34:37.726
UNDIES: You 're giving me
a fucking headache, Tink.

34:37.726 --> 34:40.527
FRANK: Mate, it's important.
Now, you know that document.

34:40.527 --> 34:42.647
What document? This one?

34:42.647 --> 34:46.726
No. The document you and Rooster
came round and showed me, right?

34:46.726 --> 34:49.007
The one that said Falconer
had been dogging to the jacks.

34:49.007 --> 34:50.804
I just remembered something.

34:52.327 --> 34:54.927
- What?
- I handled it.

34:54.927 --> 34:56.806
You know what I'm saying?

34:56.806 --> 35:01.967
This cock-and-bull story
about the dinner in Newtown,

35:01.967 --> 35:05.687
it just simply didn't happen.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.167
Yes, it did.

35:07.167 --> 35:09.047
I suggest when Anthony
came to see you

35:09.047 --> 35:11.567
he offered to pay
to fix your boat

35:11.567 --> 35:13.167
so you could all go fishing.

35:13.167 --> 35:15.367
No, he wanted to use my boat
for the job.

35:15.367 --> 35:16.847
What was the restaurant called?

35:16.847 --> 35:18.447
We're talking over
10 years ago now, sir.

35:18.447 --> 35:19.927
Why did you take the money

35:19.927 --> 35:21.927
if you had no intention
of going through with it?

35:21.927 --> 35:23.407
If they were planning
to kill me,

35:23.407 --> 35:25.407
I was happy for them
to pay for the repairs.

35:25.407 --> 35:27.167
You 've never been able
to nominate

35:27.167 --> 35:29.807
the name of the restaurant -
not ever.

35:29.807 --> 35:31.287
You could go to Hollywood

35:31.287 --> 35:32.767
you 're so good at
making up stories.

35:32.767 --> 35:36.767
You have a memory
like Swiss cheese.

35:36.767 --> 35:38.287
I'm telling the truth.

35:38.287 --> 35:41.807
I suggest that everything you say
in your statement is false.

35:41.807 --> 35:44.047
It's your job
to say that, miss.

35:44.047 --> 35:46.887
Can this document
be shown to the witness?

35:46.887 --> 35:48.798
There's a copy for Your Honour.

35:57.447 --> 36:00.927
A complaint
was made about you

36:00.927 --> 36:06.927
over an incident with
some younger prison inmates

36:06.927 --> 36:09.887
who you abused.

36:09.887 --> 36:11.967
I did not.

36:11.967 --> 36:15.447
That's why you were
attacked in prison,

36:15.447 --> 36:18.407
as, um... payback

36:18.407 --> 36:23.087
for your predatory
sexual behaviour

36:23.087 --> 36:25.767
with young males.

36:25.767 --> 36:27.917
I do not...

36:30.687 --> 36:33.047
I do not have sex
with males,

36:33.047 --> 36:34.727
thank you very much.

36:34.727 --> 36:36.445
(BOTH SNIGGER)

36:39.287 --> 36:41.727
Put me in a room
with Rooster, huh?

36:41.727 --> 36:44.287
I'll beat a confession
out of him quick smart.

36:44.287 --> 36:46.047
Cut out all this
fucking bullshit, Gary!

36:46.047 --> 36:48.287
Listen, the jury's gonna see it
for what it is, OK?

36:48.287 --> 36:50.847
It's a last-ditch attempt
to ruin your credibility.

36:50.847 --> 36:52.567
Yeah, and they don't think
I'm fucking crazy?

36:52.567 --> 36:54.047
They're not gonna think
you 're crazy, mate.

36:54.047 --> 36:55.887
They're gonna appreciate
the stress you 're under.

36:55.887 --> 36:57.367
Come here, Frank, OK?

36:57.367 --> 37:00.127
Don't let them fucking grubs
make you feel this way.

37:00.127 --> 37:02.247
Alright?

37:02.247 --> 37:04.078
Alright.

37:06.167 --> 37:07.847
I got something for you.

37:07.847 --> 37:09.927
- What's that?
- Cigars.

37:09.927 --> 37:12.367
That's for you to light up
when we convict these pricks.

37:12.367 --> 37:15.727
And let me tell you
something, Frank.

37:15.727 --> 37:18.321
If it wasn't for you,
none of us would be here today.

37:20.007 --> 37:21.487
No, Gary.

37:21.487 --> 37:25.087
I'm just lucky
I stumbled across you, eh.

37:25.087 --> 37:26.567
Brother.

37:26.567 --> 37:29.967
Come here. I mean that, eh.
You 're a brother.

37:29.967 --> 37:31.447
OK.

37:31.447 --> 37:34.086
- I got ya, alright? Trust me.
- Yeah.

37:37.367 --> 37:39.687
JACQUI JAMES: The man we have
called Frank O'Rourke

37:39.687 --> 37:42.567
was in the witness box
for close on five days

37:42.567 --> 37:45.367
before he was escorted back
to his secure location.

37:45.367 --> 37:48.439
He remains living under
an assumed name to this day.

38:01.407 --> 38:03.079
Where do you think
you 're going?

38:09.647 --> 38:12.161
- I'm on my way back to court.
- Good luck, huh?

38:13.847 --> 38:15.360
You 're coming with me.

38:16.767 --> 38:18.359
I got it.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.927
JACQUI JAMES:
After two months of evidence

38:23.927 --> 38:25.887
and 26 witnesses,

38:25.887 --> 38:28.567
there was nothing left to do
but to ask the jury

38:28.567 --> 38:30.127
to consider their verdict.

38:30.127 --> 38:32.447
LEASK: Ladies and gentlemen,

38:32.447 --> 38:35.287
this was not
a killing performed

38:35.287 --> 38:38.120
in the heat of the moment.

38:39.167 --> 38:41.727
Whether the participants
were hands-on...

38:44.527 --> 38:46.916
...or at a distance
from the dirty work...

38:48.647 --> 38:52.247
...each was involved in
the one exercise -

38:52.247 --> 38:56.081
to bring about the murder
of Terry Falconer.

38:57.767 --> 39:00.407
Now, there have been allegations
as to whether

39:00.407 --> 39:03.687
he played a role in the death
of the Perish grandparents.

39:03.687 --> 39:07.236
But Mr Falconer was robbed
of his day in court.

39:08.687 --> 39:10.678
He never got a jury trial.

39:12.047 --> 39:15.483
You 've heard evidence
of a different society...

39:16.687 --> 39:20.475
...one with its own codes,
its own values.

39:21.967 --> 39:24.607
Witnesses have described
a society

39:24.607 --> 39:26.527
which is governed by fear,

39:26.527 --> 39:29.607
where the consequences
for speaking out of school

39:29.607 --> 39:31.962
are extreme.

39:33.687 --> 39:37.567
Now, if the plan was to take
Mr Falconer back to Silverwater,

39:37.567 --> 39:40.207
why cut off a security anklet?

39:40.207 --> 39:43.887
What about the three disposable
suits and hacksaws at Girvan?

39:43.887 --> 39:45.367
What were they for?

39:45.367 --> 39:47.327
Ladies and gentlemen,

39:47.327 --> 39:51.527
Mr Falconer was never, ever
going back to Silverwater.

39:51.527 --> 39:56.007
I'd like to finish by asking you
a rhetorical question.

39:56.007 --> 39:59.647
Let's say the plan
really was

39:59.647 --> 40:02.487
simply to question
Mr Falconer.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.205
What if he'd confessed?

40:06.127 --> 40:08.687
What would Anthony
have done to him then?

40:19.087 --> 40:20.566
The jury's back.

40:33.527 --> 40:36.567
Mr Foreman, have you reached
a unanimous verdict?

40:36.567 --> 40:38.239
We have, Your Honour.

40:44.807 --> 40:47.687
Matthew Lawton
was charged with murder.

40:47.687 --> 40:49.767
How do you find the accused -

40:49.767 --> 40:52.007
guilty or not guilty?

40:52.007 --> 40:53.487
FOREMAN: Guilty.

40:53.487 --> 40:55.767
(SPECTATORS MURMUR)

40:55.767 --> 40:59.607
Andrew Perish was charged
with conspiracy to murder.

40:59.607 --> 41:01.687
How do you find the accused -

41:01.687 --> 41:03.807
guilty or not guilty?

41:03.807 --> 41:06.607
- FOREMAN: Guilty.
- (SPECTATORS MURMUR)

41:06.607 --> 41:10.287
Anthony Perish was charged
with conspiracy to murder.

41:10.287 --> 41:12.487
How do you find the accused -

41:12.487 --> 41:14.127
guilty or not guilty?

41:14.127 --> 41:15.116
Guilty.

41:16.967 --> 41:19.447
Anthony Perish was
charged with murder.

41:19.447 --> 41:23.127
How do you find the accused -

41:23.127 --> 41:25.567
guilty or not guilty?

41:25.567 --> 41:27.087
Guilty.

41:27.087 --> 41:30.079
(SPECTATORS MURMUR)

41:41.167 --> 41:44.767
JACQUI JAMES: Anthony Perish was
sentenced to 18 years non-parole

41:44.767 --> 41:46.767
for the murder
of Terry Falconer.

41:46.767 --> 41:48.247
His brother, Andrew,

41:48.247 --> 41:50.607
was sentenced to a minimum
of nine years.

41:50.607 --> 41:53.807
And his faithful retainer,
Matthew 'Muzz' Lawton,

41:53.807 --> 41:55.927
got a minimum of 15.

41:55.927 --> 41:58.367
In sentencing Anthony
for murder,

41:58.367 --> 42:01.767
the judge said the Crown had not
proved beyond reasonable doubt

42:01.767 --> 42:03.807
that Terry Falconer
was still alive

42:03.807 --> 42:05.843
when he was delivered
to Turramurra.

42:07.607 --> 42:10.447
The question of who killed
the Perish grandparents

42:10.447 --> 42:12.438
remains unanswered.

42:14.127 --> 42:15.607
It's very satisfying

42:15.607 --> 42:18.007
for a 10-year investigation
to get a result like this.

42:18.007 --> 42:20.567
I think it sends
a message to criminals

42:20.567 --> 42:22.127
that detectives will
actively pursue them

42:22.127 --> 42:23.927
no matter how long it takes.

42:23.927 --> 42:26.122
(SWITCHES TV OFF)
Good on ya, mate.

42:30.207 --> 42:33.847
(CROWD CHATTERS)

42:33.847 --> 42:35.807
Hey.

42:35.807 --> 42:38.127
Uh, James.

42:38.127 --> 42:41.847
Just wanted to say
you did your father proud.

42:41.847 --> 42:43.326
Thank you.

42:46.407 --> 42:48.807
(WHISTLES) Alright.
Everyone listen up.

42:48.807 --> 42:50.847
You know, right from the start,

42:50.847 --> 42:52.847
this job was pegged
as unsolvable.

42:52.847 --> 42:55.247
Thanks to every one of you,

42:55.247 --> 42:56.807
we did it.

42:56.807 --> 42:59.007
And we did it as a team.

42:59.007 --> 43:00.486
ALL: Yeah!

43:01.487 --> 43:05.487
There is, uh...
There is someone missing.

43:05.487 --> 43:08.604
So I'd like everyone
to raise a glass to Camille.

43:10.807 --> 43:14.004
She was... tenacious.

43:15.087 --> 43:16.567
She was determined.

43:16.567 --> 43:20.807
And she never...
listened to a word I said.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.923
(LAUGHTER)

43:24.767 --> 43:26.847
And we're all gonna
miss her very dearly.

43:26.847 --> 43:28.327
So to Camille.

43:28.327 --> 43:29.806
ALL: To Camille!

43:31.807 --> 43:35.047
There is one other person
I'd like to single out,

43:35.047 --> 43:36.927
and that's you, Browney.

43:36.927 --> 43:38.767
Hey, Downtown Browne!

43:38.767 --> 43:41.967
We all know that he likes
to keep a cool head,

43:41.967 --> 43:45.647
but there were some days
I had to check him for a pulse.

43:45.647 --> 43:47.207
(LAUGHTER)

43:47.207 --> 43:48.687
Seriously, Browney,
thank you, mate.

43:48.687 --> 43:50.287
We couldn't have done this
without you.

43:50.287 --> 43:53.207
That's it, everyone.
As I said, we've done it.

43:53.207 --> 43:56.244
We did it all together.
So congratulations.

43:57.487 --> 43:59.527
And we move on. So cheers.

43:59.527 --> 44:01.279
ALL: Cheers!

44:07.807 --> 44:09.287
Nice speech.

44:09.287 --> 44:10.767
- You like that?
- Yeah.

44:10.767 --> 44:13.679
You know, I thought
I could hear wedding bells.

44:15.487 --> 44:17.567
(PHONE RINGS)

44:17.567 --> 44:19.637
Just... you were saying?

44:21.047 --> 44:23.242
Alright. Off you go.

44:27.207 --> 44:28.767
Gary Jubelin.

44:28.767 --> 44:30.767
FRANK: Yeah,
had a missed call.

44:30.767 --> 44:33.407
So am I lighting this cigar
or what, eh?

44:33.407 --> 44:35.847
JUBELIN: The jury
believed you, Frank.

44:35.847 --> 44:37.678
They're guilty on all counts.

44:49.087 --> 44:52.847
This is a filthy, rotten cigar,
Gary, eh? You cheapskate!

44:52.847 --> 44:54.838
Call me when you got
a better offer! (HANGS UP)
