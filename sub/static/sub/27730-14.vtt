00:51.010 --> 00:53.186
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:53.230 --> 00:55.319
CORNWELL:
Control will not stop coming.

00:55.362 --> 00:57.060
Eventually,
Leland will find you.

00:57.103 --> 00:59.366
SPOCK: Ergo,Discovery's
very existence

00:59.410 --> 01:01.194
is the problem.

01:02.413 --> 01:03.936
Discovery'sshields are up.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.285
It's protecting itself.

01:05.328 --> 01:06.983
Sphere's data has
already merged

01:07.026 --> 01:08.332
with Discovery. Options.

01:08.375 --> 01:09.986
We know we can't delete
the data.

01:10.029 --> 01:11.465
Nor, it seems,
can we destroy Discovery.

01:11.509 --> 01:14.381
As long as Discovery
exists here and now,

01:14.425 --> 01:16.732
this will never be over.

01:16.775 --> 01:19.169
Discoveryhas to go
to the future.

01:19.212 --> 01:21.954
SARU:
We have the technical designs
from Section 31.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.261
We can attempt to rebuild it.Do it.

01:24.304 --> 01:26.742
Once the Enterprise
catches up with us,

01:28.787 --> 01:30.397
you're happy, Hugh.

01:32.182 --> 01:33.270
NICOLA :
Admiral, Captain Pike,

01:33.313 --> 01:34.358
there's something
you need to see.

01:34.401 --> 01:35.968
And then there were five.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.491
Commander Stamets,

01:37.535 --> 01:39.363
you will jump us to that signal.

01:39.406 --> 01:41.931
BURNHAM:
Class M planet, Xahea.

01:41.974 --> 01:43.410
Really? Xahea?

01:46.544 --> 01:48.415
Tilly!

01:49.416 --> 01:51.505
I know the queen of Xahea.

01:51.549 --> 01:54.291
So, you want to use the suit
to travel through time

01:54.334 --> 01:56.423
with this ship
flying behind you, yes?
Yes.

01:56.467 --> 01:58.077
There is just one problem.

01:58.121 --> 01:59.949
Continuous regeneration
of energy will ultimately

01:59.992 --> 02:01.385
burn out the crystal.

02:01.428 --> 02:02.516
It's a one-way trip.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.083
You're not coming, are you?

02:04.127 --> 02:05.476
I wish I could say yes.

02:09.088 --> 02:10.524
DETMER:
Attention, all vessels.

02:10.568 --> 02:12.788
Leland's fleet has arrived.

02:12.831 --> 02:15.486
PIKE: Leland and his ships will
give us one hell of a fight.

02:17.836 --> 02:19.969
BURNHAM:
We are surrounded.

02:20.012 --> 02:21.492
All enemy vessels
armed and ready.

02:21.535 --> 02:24.147
Shields up.Prepare for battle.

02:32.459 --> 02:34.113
Battle stations, report.

02:34.157 --> 02:36.028
Shields at maximum, sir.

02:36.072 --> 02:38.291
Weapons armed and ready,
Captain.

02:38.335 --> 02:40.424
Transmit to all ships.

02:40.467 --> 02:41.555
This is Captain Pike.

02:41.599 --> 02:43.470
We have one job:

02:43.514 --> 02:46.430
get Commander Burnham and Discovery
through the wormhole.

02:49.302 --> 02:53.132
Section 31 is in our way.

02:57.571 --> 03:00.009
PIKE:
Once Burnham launches
in the suit,

03:00.052 --> 03:01.575
Second Squadron
will match course and speed

03:01.619 --> 03:04.187
to cover her
and defend her perimeter.

03:04.230 --> 03:07.146
Squadrons Three and Four will
be the front line of defense

03:07.190 --> 03:09.540
against the Section 31 fleet.

03:09.583 --> 03:11.455
You will lead the attack
and draw their fire

03:11.498 --> 03:13.500
to give us the time we need.

03:13.544 --> 03:15.328
Enterprisewill maintain fire
on the fleet

03:15.372 --> 03:17.461
to cause distraction
for as long as we can.

03:17.504 --> 03:21.378
But as soon as Burnham
is detected out there,

03:21.421 --> 03:23.467
we have to keep her safe.

03:29.908 --> 03:32.868
PIKE:
All shuttles and pods, use attack formation Gamma Six.

03:32.911 --> 03:35.348
Squadrons One and Three,
coordinate positions

03:35.392 --> 03:39.352
to disrupt and target
all main enemy vessels.

03:39.396 --> 03:41.398
This is Starfleet.

03:44.575 --> 03:46.533
Get it done.

03:46.577 --> 03:48.535
Mr. Saru, ETA on that suit.

03:48.579 --> 03:49.885
The components are
being synthesized

03:49.928 --> 03:52.235
and assembled as we speak.

03:52.278 --> 03:54.324
BURNHAM: Don't adjust
the composite automatically.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.630
I'll do it manually after each
piece is cleared for assembly.

03:56.674 --> 03:58.241
I'm not detecting
any micro-variances.

03:58.284 --> 03:59.503
No, I need a surgical spanner,

03:59.546 --> 04:01.374
not a standard
engineering coupler.

04:01.418 --> 04:03.072
Stop. Look me in the eyes.

04:03.115 --> 04:05.161
The silicon injectors
need to be purged

04:05.204 --> 04:07.424
after each binding is molded.
Watch me.

04:07.467 --> 04:09.905
The bayonet joint on this
oxygen sensor's wide open.

04:09.948 --> 04:11.907
Are you trying
to kill her?

04:11.950 --> 04:13.517
Oh, shit.Get off the assembly.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.562
I got it.Sorry, Commander.

04:21.612 --> 04:24.571
High speed, low drag, Commander.
The longer it takes her

04:24.615 --> 04:27.313
to open that wormhole,
the fewer make it home.SARU : Yes, sir.

04:27.357 --> 04:29.533
What's the intel on how much
perimeter space she'll need

04:29.576 --> 04:31.187
to get far enough away
from that wormhole?

04:31.230 --> 04:32.405
Commander Burnham
needs to remain

04:32.449 --> 04:34.625
at the outermost radius
of the battle

04:34.668 --> 04:37.497
at .0004 arc-seconds.In English, please.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.412
I can't blow a path
through what you're saying.

04:39.456 --> 04:41.414
Tight enough so none
of the Section 31 ships

04:41.458 --> 04:43.939
get pulled into the future,
loose enough so none of our guys

04:43.982 --> 04:45.592
get destroyed by
the event horizon.

04:45.636 --> 04:48.508
Lieutenant Spock will remain on
comms throughout to guide her.

04:48.552 --> 04:51.468
Reno, where are we
with the time crystal?

04:51.511 --> 04:54.253
Four minutes, 18 seconds away
until fully charged.

04:54.297 --> 04:55.472
Can you cut that in half?

04:55.515 --> 04:57.604
Violate the basic laws
of physics?

04:57.648 --> 04:59.432
Uh, no.

05:00.999 --> 05:03.567
Commander, we've scanned
the Section 31 armada.

05:03.610 --> 05:06.309
There's only one life sign:
Captain Leland's.

05:06.352 --> 05:08.572
The rest of the ships
are empty.

05:08.615 --> 05:10.574
Drones. Nasty ones.

05:10.617 --> 05:13.229
Lieutenant Bryce, have you had
any success reaching Starfleet?

05:13.272 --> 05:15.622
Subspace relays are
still down, Commander.

05:15.666 --> 05:20.149
Attempting to circumvent,
but we're still being jammed.

05:20.192 --> 05:23.152
It is just us.

05:23.195 --> 05:25.632
Any, uh, words of wisdom?

05:30.637 --> 05:32.726
"Be extremely subtle,

05:32.770 --> 05:35.642
"even to the point
of formlessness.

05:35.686 --> 05:38.167
"Be extremely mysterious,

05:38.210 --> 05:40.343
even to the point
of soundlessness."

05:40.386 --> 05:42.258
"Thereby you can
be the director

05:42.301 --> 05:45.478
of your opponent's fate."

05:45.522 --> 05:48.612
I'm surprised a Kelpien,
of all beings,

05:48.655 --> 05:51.006
has studied Sun Tzu.

05:51.049 --> 05:53.747
I am surprised a Terran
is surprised by anything.

05:53.791 --> 05:55.488
BRYCE:
Incoming hail.

05:55.532 --> 05:57.621
It's Leland, sir.

06:04.802 --> 06:08.023
You will see a human face.

06:08.066 --> 06:11.330
It is not a human being.

06:11.374 --> 06:12.505
Am I clear?

06:12.549 --> 06:14.551
ALL: Yes, sir.Put it through.

06:18.685 --> 06:22.515
Leland, we were just
talking about you.

06:22.559 --> 06:24.517
Everybody hates you.

06:24.561 --> 06:26.519
Congratulations.

06:26.563 --> 06:28.347
LELAND:
You know why I'm here.

06:28.391 --> 06:30.045
Give me what I've come for,

06:30.088 --> 06:31.698
or die for it.

06:31.742 --> 06:34.658
By authority granted me under
the Articles of the Federation

06:34.701 --> 06:36.355
and Starfleet Charter,

06:36.399 --> 06:38.662
I order you
to surrender your vessels.

06:38.705 --> 06:40.403
No terms, no deals.

06:40.446 --> 06:41.752
LELAND:
Last warning.

06:41.795 --> 06:43.580
Transmit the data to me,

06:43.623 --> 06:45.538
or you'll be destroyed.

06:45.582 --> 06:47.714
By my count, we have
over 200 vessels,

06:47.758 --> 06:49.412
and you might have 30.

06:52.502 --> 06:54.721
Count again.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.682
Multiple torpedoes
locked on us.

09:09.726 --> 09:12.468
Evasive pattern Delta Five.Aye, sir.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.861
All power to forward shields.
Fire full spread.

09:39.930 --> 09:41.540
Damage report.Breach in section two.

09:41.584 --> 09:44.282
Decks nine and ten.
Seven confirmed dead.

09:45.370 --> 09:47.285
Shields at 86%.

09:47.329 --> 09:48.678
Shields at 82%.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.375
We have a breach on deck 12.

09:50.419 --> 09:52.247
Emergency bulkheads
engaged successfully.

09:54.423 --> 09:57.469
I've got a leg panel.Back plate complete.

09:59.297 --> 10:02.387
We need an adjustment on 1.0,
2.3 and 4.2.

10:02.431 --> 10:04.389
I'm on it. I got it.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.652
Reno, we need that
time crystal now.

10:06.696 --> 10:09.351
One minute away.
Charge at 98%.

10:16.967 --> 10:19.012
All squadrons on those drones
immediately!

10:19.056 --> 10:21.450
Captain Pike, it's Po.
Do you copy?

10:22.581 --> 10:23.669
Pull her up.

10:26.455 --> 10:27.717
She's flying directly
beneath them.

10:30.981 --> 10:32.504
Give me her shuttle feed.

10:34.985 --> 10:36.682
Your Highness,

10:36.726 --> 10:38.597
uh, who told you you could
fly a Federation vessel?

10:38.641 --> 10:40.512
First, I invoke
diplomatic immunity

10:40.556 --> 10:42.297
for stealing this shuttle.

10:42.340 --> 10:44.690
All due respect, Your Highness,
get out of there.

10:44.734 --> 10:45.952
Captain, listen,

10:45.996 --> 10:47.519
your squadron's gonna
get obliterated.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.607
What?

10:50.479 --> 10:52.350
I thought these drones
looked off-key.

10:52.394 --> 10:55.005
They have a refracted lattice
shield design.

10:55.048 --> 10:57.312
You can see it
in the wave patterns.

10:57.355 --> 10:58.704
They can't be
defeated one-on-one.

10:58.748 --> 11:00.489
Attack has to be two at a time,

11:00.532 --> 11:03.056
targeting port and starboard
emitters simultaneously.

11:03.100 --> 11:04.580
Po, are you sure?

11:04.623 --> 11:05.842
I'll put my life on it.

11:09.106 --> 11:11.456
All squadrons...

11:11.500 --> 11:13.545
formation Double Alpha.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.504
Team up and begin
target acquisition.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.420
Follow the queen.

11:37.656 --> 11:39.005
SARU:
Mr. Rhys,

11:39.049 --> 11:40.659
set all phasers
for automatic targeting,

11:40.703 --> 11:43.009
maximum power and range.Aye, Commander.

11:44.533 --> 11:47.623
Owo, bring the emergency
generators on line.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.712
Shields holding at 70%.

11:49.755 --> 11:51.757
Leland won't destroy this ship
immediately.

11:51.801 --> 11:54.064
He'll cripple us
and take the data.

11:54.107 --> 11:56.371
Then he'll break
Discoverydown for parts.

11:56.414 --> 11:57.850
Do you have anything
relevant to offer?

11:57.894 --> 11:59.330
Invite him aboard.

12:00.157 --> 12:01.724
Whatever you have in mind,

12:01.767 --> 12:03.508
this is not
a two-pronged mission.

12:03.552 --> 12:05.075
The first priority
is to get

12:05.118 --> 12:07.382
Discoveryto safety
with Commander Burnham.

12:07.425 --> 12:09.688
For you, perhaps.

12:09.732 --> 12:11.777
You should know me
well enough by now to know

12:11.821 --> 12:13.518
I leave very little to chance.

12:13.562 --> 12:15.520
Especially when it
comes to revenge.

12:15.564 --> 12:17.435
RENO:
Good to go.

12:17.479 --> 12:19.045
Crystal's fully charged.

12:19.089 --> 12:21.047
Ensign Tilly, go with her
and make sure

12:21.091 --> 12:22.571
it gets to
Commander Burnham safely.

12:22.614 --> 12:25.051
He means in case one of us
gets dead along the way.

12:25.095 --> 12:26.444
Hurry!

12:26.488 --> 12:28.577
I'm going, I'm going.
Get off my ass.

12:28.620 --> 12:30.448
Sir. Get off my ass, sir.

12:39.501 --> 12:41.503
What the hell?

12:50.599 --> 12:54.429
They're gonna make a run on
weakening Discovery'sshields.

13:00.522 --> 13:01.827
Divert all power
to starboard shield deflectors.

13:01.871 --> 13:04.134
Number One, bring us around
and place us between

13:04.177 --> 13:05.788
those drones and Discovery. Aye, Captain.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.857
Shields down to 54%
and dropping fast.

13:37.646 --> 13:40.910
Lieutenant Mann,
target the largest 31 vessel

13:40.953 --> 13:42.955
and fire on
their shield generators.Aye, Captain.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.609
The entire fleet is
receiving signals

13:44.653 --> 13:45.915
from Leland
inside that ship.

13:49.658 --> 13:51.137
Has the shuttle bay
been evacuated?

13:51.181 --> 13:52.487
Yes, Commander.

13:52.530 --> 13:53.879
The housing is prepped.

13:53.923 --> 13:56.186
I need that last panel.

13:56.229 --> 13:57.666
Right here.

14:17.207 --> 14:18.730
Michael?

14:20.210 --> 14:21.690
I'm good. You?

14:23.692 --> 14:25.868
You okay?
Yeah.

14:30.612 --> 14:31.917
Everybody. Reno?

14:31.961 --> 14:34.659
I'm a cat. Five more
lives at least.

14:34.703 --> 14:35.660
Hey. You okay?

14:35.704 --> 14:37.662
We're good.

14:37.706 --> 14:39.577
BURNHAM: Oh, no!

14:39.621 --> 14:41.536
No, Commander!
Oh, my God.

14:41.579 --> 14:42.798
Oh, my God.

14:44.800 --> 14:46.671
Take this.

14:46.715 --> 14:47.933
Get him to sickbay.

14:47.977 --> 14:49.544
I'm gonna clean up
this mess

14:49.587 --> 14:51.546
so nobody else
gets impaled.

14:52.721 --> 14:54.679
You're okay.

14:54.723 --> 14:56.986
SPOCK:
Michael.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.641
Michael.Let's go.

15:15.004 --> 15:17.006
Shields unable
to absorb full impact.

15:17.049 --> 15:18.573
Shields?

15:18.616 --> 15:20.705
We're at 60%. Discovery'sat 38.

15:20.749 --> 15:22.838
At this rate, neither ship is
gonna last much longer.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.623
We're not on our heels yet.
Maintain offensive focus.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.320
Make them come to us.

15:30.628 --> 15:32.717
Commander,
we are overloaded in sickbay.

15:32.761 --> 15:35.590
Class four casualties in here,
class three in the corridor.

15:35.633 --> 15:36.852
Cortical stimulation's
failing!

15:36.895 --> 15:38.680
Any free hands to help us
down here?

15:38.723 --> 15:39.942
Hey, I need that bio-bed.

15:39.985 --> 15:41.639
SARU :
I am sorry, Doctor.

15:41.683 --> 15:42.858
All personnel on board
are occupied.

15:42.901 --> 15:45.295
Do your best.

15:45.338 --> 15:47.732
No, I'm gonna do
a half-assed job,

15:47.776 --> 15:49.604
because now's the perfect time.

15:52.911 --> 15:55.610
The suit is ready.

15:55.653 --> 15:57.133
Are you?

15:59.309 --> 16:02.617
It's your mother,
and it's you.

16:02.660 --> 16:05.054
Trust what you've
done together.

16:07.839 --> 16:09.885
I do.

16:47.096 --> 16:49.054
Damn.

16:49.098 --> 16:50.708
You will be the target
out there.

16:50.752 --> 16:52.014
I'll pilot a shuttle
to make sure

16:52.057 --> 16:53.319
you reach the perimeter point.

16:53.363 --> 16:54.930
What are you
talking about?

16:54.973 --> 16:56.801
You're supposed to
guide me by comms.

16:56.845 --> 16:59.325
You can't protect me in that.There is no time for debate.

16:59.369 --> 17:00.718
I will return to Discovery

17:00.762 --> 17:02.111
as soon as you open
the wormhole.

17:05.375 --> 17:06.419
I said...

17:06.463 --> 17:08.944
I heard you.

17:08.987 --> 17:10.641
You better.

17:31.183 --> 17:32.750
Stay in my wake.

17:50.507 --> 17:52.030
Discoverybridge,
this is Lieutenant Spock.

17:52.074 --> 17:53.902
Prepare to lower
shuttle bay force field

17:53.945 --> 17:56.208
and drop aft shields
for 3.5 seconds on my mark.

17:57.775 --> 17:59.734
Understood, Lieutenant.
Captain Pike,

17:59.777 --> 18:01.474
we are preparing
to lower aft shields.

18:01.518 --> 18:03.738
Cover fire would be
most appreciated.

18:06.175 --> 18:07.785
We got you, Saru.

18:07.829 --> 18:09.961
All vessels.Yes, Captain.

18:10.005 --> 18:11.789
PIKE:
We've calculated
that Commander Burnham

18:11.833 --> 18:14.139
will need two minutes
and 47 seconds to reach

18:14.183 --> 18:15.924
safe distance
and open the wormhole.

18:15.967 --> 18:18.143
All squadrons, form
a tactical escort around her

18:18.187 --> 18:21.059
on her path
and screen enemy fire.

18:21.103 --> 18:23.758
I want a cocoon around her until
she gets to her destination.

18:23.801 --> 18:25.890
On it, Captain.
If she doesn't make it

18:25.934 --> 18:27.239
off the battlefield
and far enough away

18:27.283 --> 18:29.764
to open the wormhole,
neither do we.

18:42.124 --> 18:44.256
Lower shields in five.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.216
Four.

18:47.259 --> 18:49.087
Three.

18:49.131 --> 18:51.437
Two. One.

19:30.868 --> 19:32.478
COMPUTER:
Interstellar debris density:

19:32.522 --> 19:34.567
72% above nominal.

19:34.611 --> 19:36.831
Scanning for nominal
local coordinates.

19:47.058 --> 19:49.147
Michael.

19:49.191 --> 19:50.888
BURNHAM:
I'm okay.

19:50.932 --> 19:53.151
I got this.

20:02.639 --> 20:04.119
All battle groups...

20:04.162 --> 20:05.990
form a shield wall
against those ships.

20:06.034 --> 20:08.079
Maintain protective formations.

20:08.123 --> 20:10.038
Discoveryand Enterprise
will lead.

20:10.081 --> 20:12.997
Nobody gets through us until
Burnham reaches her target.

20:22.267 --> 20:24.052
Commander, sensors are
showing that something

20:24.095 --> 20:25.967
beamed aboard
while our shields were down.

20:49.947 --> 20:52.036
NHAN: He's going for
the Sphere data.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.169
Everybody, stay here.Like hell.

20:56.649 --> 20:58.956
Sir.

20:59.000 --> 21:02.917
Sensors show Captain Leland
beamed aboard Discovery.

21:06.964 --> 21:09.924
We'd have to lower our own
shields to beam a team on board.

21:09.967 --> 21:11.273
Discovery
would have to lower theirs.

21:11.316 --> 21:14.102
We can't do it,
Chris.

21:14.145 --> 21:16.017
I know.

21:22.980 --> 21:24.939
I will override
the security codes.

21:24.982 --> 21:27.332
You try accessing
the lock mechanism directly.

21:30.031 --> 21:32.250
How much longer
before you gain entry?

21:32.294 --> 21:34.122
Five minutes.

21:34.165 --> 21:36.124
Less if you stop bothering us.

21:39.692 --> 21:41.259
Commander, shields down to 38%.

21:41.303 --> 21:42.957
Hold the line, Lieutenant.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.654
Yes, sir.

21:44.697 --> 21:46.308
After we are done
breaking and entering,

21:46.351 --> 21:49.615
would you like to join me
in making Leland scream?

21:49.659 --> 21:51.269
Yum, yum.

21:59.016 --> 22:00.626
We are at a safe distance,
Michael.

22:00.670 --> 22:02.280
Understood.

22:16.033 --> 22:17.992
Stand by.

22:20.342 --> 22:22.692
HELMET COMPUTER:
Insufficient vertices
calculated.

22:22.735 --> 22:25.042
Temporal interface access
standing by.

22:25.086 --> 22:26.304
It's not working.

22:27.305 --> 22:28.654
Navigational system's stuck

22:28.698 --> 22:30.700
in the present;
it won't move forward.

22:32.049 --> 22:33.703
Why won't it move forward?

23:08.172 --> 23:10.087
Captain.

23:10.131 --> 23:12.350
An undetonated
photon torpedo

23:12.394 --> 23:14.048
has breached the hull.

23:14.091 --> 23:17.138
If it blows,

23:17.181 --> 23:20.271
it'll rip a hole four decks wide
in our saucer section.

23:33.850 --> 23:36.070
Everything I saw...

23:37.854 --> 23:39.464
...this is how it starts.

23:39.508 --> 23:42.380
I saw this
exact moment

23:42.424 --> 23:44.295
when I touched
the crystal.

23:57.265 --> 23:59.571
Was that torpedo lodged,
Lieutenant? And is it live?

23:59.615 --> 24:01.138
Deck five,
section two.

24:01.182 --> 24:02.618
And yes, sir.

24:03.619 --> 24:06.187
Lower blast shields
five and two.

24:06.230 --> 24:07.623
Lieutenant Mann,
deploy the DOT Sevens.

24:07.666 --> 24:10.539
Aye, Captain.I want them standing
by for repair.

24:21.637 --> 24:23.247
Lieutenant Amin, can we seal off

24:23.291 --> 24:25.206
the bay where the
torpedo landed?

24:25.249 --> 24:27.164
Only one of the
blast shields'll drop, Captain.

24:27.208 --> 24:28.818
The other one's jammed.

24:28.861 --> 24:31.212
Lieutenant Nicola, do we have
anyone from Munitions available?

24:31.255 --> 24:33.605
All occupied, Admiral.

24:33.649 --> 24:35.129
I'll fix the door on-site.

24:35.172 --> 24:36.130
Get me a PADD.

24:36.173 --> 24:37.261
Number One, I'm with you.

24:37.305 --> 24:38.349
We'll have to disarm
simultaneously.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.698
Figure out what kind of weapon

24:39.742 --> 24:41.352
we're dealing with
and send me the schematics.

24:41.396 --> 24:43.615
Yes, ma'am.

24:49.752 --> 24:52.233
Shield-emitter in zones five
and seven are damaged.

24:52.276 --> 24:53.495
We'll break into pieces

24:53.538 --> 24:55.540
if we go into the wormhole
without shields.

24:55.584 --> 24:57.238
If we even get there.

24:57.281 --> 24:59.501
Come on, Burnham.

24:59.544 --> 25:02.199
BURNHAM: Spock, the navigation interface still won't let me set

25:02.243 --> 25:03.418
a destination point
in the future.

25:03.461 --> 25:05.202
SPOCK:
Without a destination point,

25:05.246 --> 25:07.422
we will not be able
to open the wormhole.

25:12.340 --> 25:13.515
Michael.No.

25:14.559 --> 25:16.344
Nothing.

25:17.606 --> 25:19.695
If I set the signals,
why can't I move us forward?

25:19.738 --> 25:22.263
There have been seven signals
and we have only seen five.

25:22.306 --> 25:24.656
Why would I bring us
all this way to get

25:24.700 --> 25:26.702
stuck in this moment
and die here?

25:28.269 --> 25:29.705
NHAN:
Door's almost open.

25:31.750 --> 25:33.317
Squadrons four through nine
are down.

25:33.361 --> 25:34.666
We're losing too many fighters.

25:34.710 --> 25:36.712
Life support failing
on decks seven through 13.

25:36.755 --> 25:39.236
Shields at 11% and dropping.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.456
Ten percent... we're at nine.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.545
All remaining power
to forward shields.

25:43.588 --> 25:45.329
Come about starboard 90 degrees.

26:02.607 --> 26:05.262
We have an incoming
energy signature.

26:05.306 --> 26:06.263
It's massive.

26:24.368 --> 26:27.284
It's a Klingon
cleave ship, sir.

26:27.328 --> 26:30.635
But I'm detecting non-Klingon
power signatures, too.

26:34.639 --> 26:36.815
Those are Ba'ul fighters.

26:40.776 --> 26:42.560
We're being hailed,
Commander.

26:42.604 --> 26:45.302
Put it through.Yes, sir.

26:45.346 --> 26:47.435
Brother.

26:47.478 --> 26:48.784
Siranna.

26:48.827 --> 26:51.352
I received your message.

26:51.395 --> 26:53.397
I will never again
let you fight alone.

26:53.441 --> 26:54.833
You...

26:54.877 --> 26:57.488
have learned to pilot a fighter.

26:57.532 --> 27:00.274
SIRANNA:
We were on our way
when one of your crew

27:00.317 --> 27:02.798
hailed us to unify our efforts.

27:02.841 --> 27:04.756
Who?

27:04.800 --> 27:06.758
Captain, we're being hailed
by the Klingons.

27:08.847 --> 27:10.588
On screen.

27:10.632 --> 27:12.677
Sorry it took us a while
to get here, Captain.

27:12.721 --> 27:15.289
Calvary arrived just in time.

27:15.332 --> 27:16.768
I see you've brought
some new friends.

27:16.812 --> 27:19.336
Not the term I would choose,
Captain.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.773
However, the Klingon Empire
will always

27:21.817 --> 27:23.862
fight to preserve our future.

27:23.906 --> 27:25.516
Works for me.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.345
The D7 will arrive
momentarily, Captain.

27:28.389 --> 27:30.347
Please transmit
tactical analysis

27:30.391 --> 27:32.436
of all enemy
vessels to us.

27:32.480 --> 27:33.829
Stand by for transfer.

27:45.841 --> 27:48.452
Siranna, the drones
have altered course

27:48.496 --> 27:49.671
to intercept your fleet.

27:49.714 --> 27:51.368
Promise me you will be safe.

27:52.413 --> 27:53.414
I can promise you
that I will fight

27:53.457 --> 27:55.720
as a Kelpien, Saru.

27:58.506 --> 28:00.638
Warriors of Kaminar,

28:00.682 --> 28:03.554
hold your course
and calculate target locks.

28:08.385 --> 28:09.734
SARU :
All ships.

28:09.778 --> 28:11.649
The Klingons and Kelpiens
have joined our fight.

28:11.693 --> 28:14.609
Transmit encrypted data
on the enemy fleet

28:14.652 --> 28:16.350
and advise all squad commanders

28:16.393 --> 28:18.482
to coordinate their efforts
with our new allies.

28:29.754 --> 28:32.583
Michael,
the Ba'ul ships

28:32.627 --> 28:34.846
arrived here piloted
by the Kelpiens

28:34.890 --> 28:36.718
because your signal led
Discoveryto Kaminar.Not now, Spock.

28:36.761 --> 28:38.633
Yes, now. Precisely now.

28:40.896 --> 28:43.725
The signal's purpose was not
simply to liberate the Kelpiens

28:43.768 --> 28:46.510
but to prepare them for this.
For this very moment.

28:46.554 --> 28:47.903
You used each signal
to lead Discovery

28:47.946 --> 28:49.774
to an element we would need
to win this battle.

28:53.430 --> 28:55.432
Starting with Reno
on the asteroid.

28:55.476 --> 28:57.434
And to Boreth,
to acquire the time crystal.

28:59.741 --> 29:01.438
To Xahea to find the one woman

29:01.482 --> 29:03.527
in all the universe
who could power it.

29:04.702 --> 29:05.964
And to Terralysium
to identify safe harbor

29:06.008 --> 29:07.749
once we're through
the wormhole.

29:12.754 --> 29:15.452
I saw us fail.

29:15.496 --> 29:17.759
I saw everyone die.

29:17.802 --> 29:19.978
The crystal showed you
a possible future.

29:22.459 --> 29:24.853
To avoid it.

29:24.896 --> 29:27.682
We assumed I jumped
from somewhere in the future

29:27.725 --> 29:29.945
to set the signals,
we didn't know from where.

29:29.988 --> 29:32.469
I jumped from here.

29:32.513 --> 29:34.863
From this moment.

29:34.906 --> 29:36.647
SPOCK:
That is correct.

29:36.691 --> 29:38.780
In order for us to push forward,
you must go back

29:38.823 --> 29:40.782
and set the events of the past
in motion,

29:40.825 --> 29:42.740
which you have not yet done.

29:42.784 --> 29:44.002
Right.

29:44.046 --> 29:45.526
Because we've been stuck
in an open loop

29:45.569 --> 29:47.441
in this time, this time.

29:47.484 --> 29:48.877
I have all the pieces
to close it.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.748
Once you do,
Control cannot evolve.

29:50.792 --> 29:52.533
So I'll go back to the asteroid
and set the first signal

29:52.576 --> 29:53.534
and then set all the rest again.

29:53.577 --> 29:55.536
They will lead you back here.

29:55.579 --> 29:56.711
And then do you believe
we'll be able to go

29:56.754 --> 29:57.755
to the future we want?

29:58.800 --> 30:01.585
Of that, I cannot be certain.

30:01.629 --> 30:04.980
So you're asking me
to take a leap of faith.

30:06.068 --> 30:08.897
One that is only logical.

30:15.860 --> 30:18.559
COMPUTER:
Unable to locate Sphere data.

30:22.519 --> 30:23.738
GEORGIOU:
I know where it is.

30:25.043 --> 30:28.046
Leland, you look well.

30:28.090 --> 30:29.787
For a couple of batteries
and a data core

30:29.831 --> 30:30.962
stuffed in a meat sack.

30:31.006 --> 30:33.704
Kind of like an A.I. sausage.Ew.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.576
Women, stop talking.

30:35.619 --> 30:36.968
Remember this?

30:37.012 --> 30:39.797
That's a quantum signal
amplifier.

30:39.841 --> 30:41.495
I gave it to you
to transfer

30:41.538 --> 30:42.887
the Sphere data
to my ship.

30:42.931 --> 30:44.933
I assume you're holding it
now to demonstrate...

30:44.976 --> 30:47.979
Why you won't find
the Sphere data anywhere here.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.940
Where can I access my data?

30:51.983 --> 30:53.855
Your data?
Hmm.

30:53.898 --> 30:56.074
So many fun ways
to answer that question.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.737
Torpedo's in there.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.870
It's safe to enter.

31:10.872 --> 31:12.569
PIKE:
Number One, status update.

31:12.613 --> 31:13.875
On-site, Captain.

31:13.918 --> 31:15.616
The blast door is jammed.

31:15.659 --> 31:16.878
Its release mechanism
is fried.

31:16.921 --> 31:18.532
I'm trying to override
the primary circuits

31:18.575 --> 31:20.664
and reroute through
secondary relays.

31:20.708 --> 31:22.710
Admiral, how are things
on your end?

31:22.753 --> 31:23.928
Bad.

31:23.972 --> 31:25.930
PIKE:
Define "bad," please, Admiral.

31:28.150 --> 31:31.588
Secondary detonation's
already been triggered.

31:31.632 --> 31:34.896
I'd say about 15 minutes before
it takes out half the ship.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.903
NURSE:
What about the
injured on deck 12?

31:41.946 --> 31:43.774
We get them stable,
we get them out. You got it?

31:43.818 --> 31:44.775
On it.

31:44.819 --> 31:45.994
TILLY:
Dr. Pollard!

31:46.037 --> 31:47.909
Bio-bed.
Okay.

31:49.084 --> 31:51.652
Easy, easy.

31:51.695 --> 31:54.045
MAN:
Dr. Pollard.

31:54.089 --> 31:56.787
You, over there.
Take bed two.

31:56.831 --> 31:58.572
I could use an extra hand here.

31:58.615 --> 32:00.791
I got this.
Get back to the bridge.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.706
Tilly, go.

32:02.750 --> 32:03.881
Go.

32:03.925 --> 32:05.796
POLLARD:
Nilsson, now!

32:07.189 --> 32:10.714
TILLY:
I'm sorry,
Commander, I'm...

32:17.634 --> 32:19.636
CULBER:
Paul?

32:19.680 --> 32:22.639
Hi.

32:22.683 --> 32:23.945
Hugh?
Hi.

32:23.988 --> 32:25.033
But...

32:25.076 --> 32:26.600
I know you're in a lot of pain.

32:26.643 --> 32:27.688
Paul,

32:27.731 --> 32:29.733
your injuries

32:29.777 --> 32:32.606
are pretty severe.
I'm going to induce coma.

32:32.649 --> 32:34.172
You'll be fine.

32:34.216 --> 32:36.610
Just listen to my voice.
You can hear me.

32:42.180 --> 32:44.095
I thought I could make
my home on Enterprise.

32:45.662 --> 32:47.708
You're doing fine.

32:47.751 --> 32:53.017
Then I realized that,
uh, you're my home.

32:54.802 --> 32:56.194
So I came back.

32:59.676 --> 33:02.766
Everything...

33:02.810 --> 33:06.814
always...
came back around to you.

33:08.772 --> 33:10.644
I'm just sorry it took me
so long to see it.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.997
So you go to sleep now, okay?

33:16.040 --> 33:18.086
And you let me take care of you.

33:21.176 --> 33:23.787
I'm your family.

33:23.831 --> 33:25.920
Wherever we go from here...

33:27.748 --> 33:30.185
...we go together.

33:38.019 --> 33:39.760
BURNHAM:
I've set all my jumps.

33:39.803 --> 33:42.023
All five. I think...

33:42.066 --> 33:44.155
SPOCK:
The future is still
unwritten, Michael.

33:44.199 --> 33:46.114
The outcome can still change.

33:52.903 --> 33:54.905
Spock!

33:55.993 --> 33:57.691
Go, Michael! Now!

35:42.883 --> 35:44.536
HELMET COMPUTER:
First signal.

35:44.580 --> 35:46.930
Destination point: USS Hiawatha.

35:46.974 --> 35:51.761
Stardate: 1025.19.

35:59.943 --> 36:01.205
This little dot

36:01.249 --> 36:03.207
is the only one willing
to tell us where it is.

36:05.166 --> 36:07.124
SARU:
It appears to be
an interstellar asteroid.

36:07.168 --> 36:08.822
OWOSEKUN:
The USSHiawatha,
thought destroyed

36:08.865 --> 36:10.171
by the Klingons ten months ago.

36:10.214 --> 36:12.042
PIKE:
Man, they came down hard.

36:13.609 --> 36:15.829
I'm Commander Jett Reno,
Engineering.

36:48.644 --> 36:50.167
HELMET COMPUTER:
Second signal.

36:50.211 --> 36:54.432
Terralysium. Stardate: 1027.32.

37:02.049 --> 37:04.181
In 64 minutes the radiation
will reach the upper atmosphere,

37:04.225 --> 37:08.316
causing an extinction
level event.

37:08.359 --> 37:10.361
SARU:
If we were
brought here,

37:10.405 --> 37:13.016
perhaps this is why.

37:13.060 --> 37:16.237
Discovery will not allow
a catastrophe on her watch.

37:16.280 --> 37:18.021
DETMER:
The asteroid successfully
diverted

37:18.065 --> 37:20.981
all the debris
from the planet's atmosphere.

37:31.121 --> 37:33.384
Where's my data?

37:33.428 --> 37:34.385
Hell.

37:59.323 --> 38:01.369
We have a hull breach
in zone four.

38:01.412 --> 38:03.414
Working on shields.Working on gravity systems.

38:03.458 --> 38:06.026
Commander, shields
aren't responding.

38:07.288 --> 38:09.420
SARU:
Shield failure in zone four.

38:09.464 --> 38:11.335
Any available crew respond.

38:11.379 --> 38:14.948
I'm in four. I'm gonna swap
the particle matrix and emitter,

38:14.991 --> 38:17.037
and get the shields
back on line.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.039
I just have
to keep my eyes closed.

38:19.082 --> 38:20.997
What?I've only done this once,

38:21.041 --> 38:22.956
and I was blindfolded
for a drinking game.

38:22.999 --> 38:24.435
Ensign, we cannot depart
without shields.

38:24.479 --> 38:26.133
Yeah, I'm aware.

38:26.176 --> 38:29.963
COMPUTER:
Global gravity systems failure.

38:31.007 --> 38:33.705
Global gravity systems failure.

39:01.777 --> 39:03.474
It doesn't have to be this hard.

39:03.518 --> 39:06.086
Not hard is boring,
and I hate boring.

39:37.117 --> 39:39.162
COMPUTER:
Gravity restored.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.444
HELMET COMPUTER:
Third signal. Kaminar.

40:00.488 --> 40:04.057
Stardate: 1035.86.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.122
SIRANNA:
You brought hope back with you.

40:26.166 --> 40:28.168
You and your Red Angel.

40:37.307 --> 40:38.569
Damn it.

40:38.613 --> 40:40.267
The matter/antimatter
intermix regulator

40:40.310 --> 40:41.398
is still fully functional.

40:41.442 --> 40:42.834
I can't disable it.

40:42.878 --> 40:44.575
Let's try reprogramming
the guidance system.

40:44.619 --> 40:46.577
Maybe a conflicting command
will force it to shut down

40:46.621 --> 40:49.319
until it acquires a new target.

40:49.363 --> 40:51.582
You're sure there's no way
to reprogram the blast door

40:51.626 --> 40:54.107
instead?I wish there were.

40:54.150 --> 40:57.240
Captain, plans A and B
didn't work.

40:57.284 --> 41:00.287
We're now into the Hail Mary
part of the operation.

41:02.332 --> 41:04.334
That's been just about
everything today.

41:04.378 --> 41:05.596
How much time do we have left?

41:05.640 --> 41:07.859
Less than five minutes.

41:07.903 --> 41:10.427
Report back to the bridge,
I'm giving you the conn.

41:10.471 --> 41:12.255
And, uh, Admiral,
do everything you can

41:12.299 --> 41:13.343
to buy Burnham more time.

41:13.387 --> 41:15.258
I'll be down in a moment.

41:15.302 --> 41:16.303
Wait.

41:22.222 --> 41:23.310
Admiral.

41:55.516 --> 41:59.346
And I thought my chancellorship
would be bloodless.

42:14.361 --> 42:16.232
HELMET COMPUTER:
Fourth signal.

42:16.276 --> 42:17.929
Boreth. Klingon territory.

42:17.973 --> 42:21.281
Stardate: 1048.66.

42:25.720 --> 42:28.331
PIKE:
A new time crystal could let us
send the Sphere data

42:28.375 --> 42:30.203
into the future after all.

42:35.686 --> 42:37.514
HELMET COMPUTER:
Fifth signal. Xahea.

42:37.558 --> 42:40.604
Stardate: 1050.8.

42:42.650 --> 42:46.219
PIKE: And what might Xahea have to do with powering the time crystal?

42:46.262 --> 42:48.569
PO:
My dilithium incubator--
it'll replicate the power

42:48.612 --> 42:51.398
of a supernova
and it'll charge your crystal.

43:00.276 --> 43:01.582
Michael?

43:07.588 --> 43:09.590
It's done.

43:11.026 --> 43:12.549
My mom said she was trapped

43:12.593 --> 43:14.725
950 years into the future
from Doctari Alpha.

43:14.769 --> 43:16.553
That was 20 years ago.

43:16.597 --> 43:18.468
Burnham to Discovery.
I'm setting coordinates

43:18.512 --> 43:20.253
for the Beta Quadrant,
Terralysium,

43:20.296 --> 43:22.559
930 years
from this launch point.

43:22.603 --> 43:24.648
That should take us
where we need to go.

43:27.651 --> 43:30.741
Commander, the quantum
fluctuations within the wormhole

43:30.785 --> 43:35.268
make it difficult to track your
position using standard sensors.

43:37.574 --> 43:39.794
How do you intend
to guide us through?

43:42.405 --> 43:44.320
I'll send a signal.

43:44.364 --> 43:47.323
The sixth signal. Like the
North Star, that's what this is.

43:47.367 --> 43:49.673
You can follow it to me
on the other side.

43:49.717 --> 43:52.285
Copy, Commander.

43:53.808 --> 43:56.289
I'm approaching
the briefing room now.

43:56.332 --> 43:57.812
Copy that, Captain.

43:57.855 --> 44:00.815
Standing by to assist.Thank you, Number One.

44:19.834 --> 44:22.793
Your algorithm was
the easiest to predict.

44:22.837 --> 44:24.578
You would want fast access

44:24.621 --> 44:29.322
to the ship's
two most valuable assets.

44:29.365 --> 44:32.847
The data is in
the spore console.

44:46.382 --> 44:49.864
You think this
cage will hold me?

44:58.525 --> 45:00.483
What if we transfer the
antimatter to antimatter pods?

45:00.527 --> 45:02.398
Too risky.

45:02.442 --> 45:04.661
You sure you can't reprogram
the guidance system?

45:07.708 --> 45:09.362
I've tried.

45:11.451 --> 45:13.104
This thing is gonna blow
in 90 seconds.

45:13.148 --> 45:17.500
There's an emergency lever
for the blast door.

45:17.544 --> 45:19.415
I can bring
it down manually,

45:19.459 --> 45:20.547
from the inside,

45:20.590 --> 45:22.549
and seal off
the rest of the ship.

45:22.592 --> 45:25.856
No.We are out of time.

45:25.900 --> 45:29.643
That last light will change,
this torpedo will blow,

45:29.686 --> 45:31.122
and everyone on the bridge,

45:31.166 --> 45:32.820
maybe everyone on this ship,
will die.

45:32.863 --> 45:34.387
And if you do this, youdie.

45:34.430 --> 45:36.867
This is my ship,
my responsibility.

45:36.911 --> 45:38.869
This isn't where
your story ends.

45:38.913 --> 45:40.697
And I think you know that.

45:43.178 --> 45:46.703
If I'm meant
for a different future,

45:46.747 --> 45:48.879
this thing can't possibly go off
with me in here.

45:48.923 --> 45:50.707
Maybe not.

45:50.751 --> 45:53.536
But how many people will pay
the price if you're wrong?

45:57.932 --> 45:59.412
Kat...

45:59.455 --> 46:02.415
Go. It's time.

46:03.764 --> 46:05.766
And, Chris...

46:07.202 --> 46:11.859
...whatever your path may be,
you can handle it.

46:57.034 --> 46:59.776
Discoveryto Enterprise,
are you all right?

46:59.820 --> 47:01.822
We're okay.

47:03.867 --> 47:05.739
But we lost the admiral.

47:14.008 --> 47:16.576
SARU:
Burnham, we are running
out of time.

47:16.619 --> 47:18.534
Okay, it's time to go, Spock.

47:18.578 --> 47:20.536
Get back to Discovery.

47:20.580 --> 47:23.017
Michael,

47:23.060 --> 47:25.628
I cannot.

47:25.672 --> 47:27.761
What?

47:27.804 --> 47:29.676
When my vessel was hit...

47:32.548 --> 47:34.681
My engines are disabled.

47:34.724 --> 47:36.813
Discoverycan lock onto you
with a tractor beam.

47:36.857 --> 47:38.989
There is no time.
And even if there were,

47:39.033 --> 47:40.991
they would need to lower their
shields to bring me aboard,

47:41.035 --> 47:43.603
and they will not survive
doing so. Not in this battle.

47:43.646 --> 47:45.779
Not with the amount of damage
that ship has already sustained.

47:47.868 --> 47:49.739
You must go.

47:55.702 --> 47:57.704
I just got you back.

47:59.619 --> 48:01.577
I don't want to let go.

48:01.621 --> 48:05.668
Neither... do I.

48:07.757 --> 48:09.803
I already lost you once.

48:09.846 --> 48:11.587
You never lost me, Michael.

48:11.631 --> 48:13.633
As a child,

48:13.676 --> 48:16.070
I was truly lost.

48:16.113 --> 48:17.854
The path of my father,

48:17.898 --> 48:20.596
the path of my mother.

48:20.640 --> 48:22.859
You came into our lives
and you taught me

48:22.903 --> 48:24.992
it was possible to travel both.

48:26.036 --> 48:28.778
You found me.

48:28.822 --> 48:31.128
You saved me.

48:34.784 --> 48:36.873
That wasn't me.

48:36.917 --> 48:38.919
That was always in you.

48:38.962 --> 48:42.836
You are my balance, Michael,

48:42.879 --> 48:45.752
you always have been, and I...

48:45.795 --> 48:48.885
am afraid

48:48.929 --> 48:50.931
that I will not find it
again without you.

48:50.974 --> 48:53.890
Okay.

48:53.934 --> 48:55.675
Listen to me.

48:58.808 --> 49:00.810
Listen to me, little brother.

49:02.377 --> 49:05.598
This is the last advice
I'll ever be able to give you.

49:05.641 --> 49:09.819
There is a whole galaxy
out there

49:09.863 --> 49:14.084
full of people
who will reach for you.

49:14.128 --> 49:16.609
You have to let them.

49:16.652 --> 49:20.917
Find that person who seems
farthest from you,

49:20.961 --> 49:22.745
and reach for them.

49:22.789 --> 49:25.095
Reach for them.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.098
Let them guide you.

49:34.801 --> 49:37.673
I will.

49:37.717 --> 49:40.937
I only wish I could be certain

49:40.981 --> 49:42.722
of your safety.

49:48.118 --> 49:50.120
You will.

49:52.079 --> 49:54.647
I'll send the last signal.

49:56.910 --> 49:58.128
I'll send it
through the wormhole

49:58.172 --> 50:00.043
when we get to the other side.

50:00.087 --> 50:03.917
I will watch the stars for it.

50:19.019 --> 50:22.152
Oh, enough with
the tantrum already.

50:22.196 --> 50:23.937
Let's end this now, shall we?

50:26.026 --> 50:28.811
You should know I've
magnetized the spore cube.

50:28.855 --> 50:30.030
Enjoy.

50:58.972 --> 51:00.190
SPOCK :
Spock to Enterprise.

51:00.234 --> 51:01.975
My shuttle's engines
are disabled.

51:02.018 --> 51:05.195
I will not be returning
to Discovery.

51:05.239 --> 51:07.894
Hold your position.
We'll transport you out.

51:07.937 --> 51:09.809
Commander Saru,
how are your shields?

51:12.115 --> 51:14.161
Ensign Tilly, where are we?

51:17.251 --> 51:19.253
Almost there.

51:24.911 --> 51:27.783
Somebody owes me a beer.

51:27.827 --> 51:29.742
We are good to go, sir.

51:29.785 --> 51:31.091
Shields back up to 40%.

51:31.134 --> 51:33.136
More than enough, Captain.

51:33.180 --> 51:34.790
PIKE :
Stand by to transport, Spock.

51:36.531 --> 51:38.098
...Michael.

51:40.013 --> 51:43.277
I love you, too, brother.

51:50.806 --> 51:52.852
Commander Burnham,
on your mark.

52:07.867 --> 52:11.348
Burnham to Discovery.Let's go.

52:30.890 --> 52:32.892
Lieutenant Detmer, full power.
Follow our signal.

53:04.314 --> 53:07.970
All vessels,
aim at 3-mark-5-mark-2.

53:08.014 --> 53:10.146
Clear a path.

53:10.190 --> 53:13.367
Goodbye, Captain Pike.

53:13.410 --> 53:17.066
Goodbye, my friends.

53:17.110 --> 53:19.939
My family.

53:24.944 --> 53:26.249
We're on our way, Paul.

53:29.209 --> 53:31.951
We're on our way.

53:35.258 --> 53:38.609
This does not end here.

53:38.653 --> 53:40.960
Actually, it does,

53:41.003 --> 53:43.397
and it's
going to hurt.

53:43.440 --> 53:47.880
And I'd like
to hear you scream now.

53:56.018 --> 53:57.933
No!

54:26.353 --> 54:28.224
Captain, they're all
dead in the water.

54:28.268 --> 54:30.923
Open fire.

54:35.101 --> 54:39.061
Georgiou to bridge.
I'm in Engineering.

54:39.105 --> 54:40.410
Leland is dead.

54:40.454 --> 54:42.238
Control is neutralized.

54:42.282 --> 54:44.371
SARU:
Copy, Commander.

54:44.414 --> 54:46.068
We are on our way.

54:46.112 --> 54:48.288
Go.

54:48.331 --> 54:50.290
Go, go.

57:06.426 --> 57:08.341
COUNCIL MEMBER:
State your name and rank.

57:08.384 --> 57:11.213
Ash Tyler, Acting Commander,
Section 31.

57:11.257 --> 57:14.129
Christopher Pike,
Captain of the USS Enterprise.

57:14.173 --> 57:17.393
Number One.
How long is this gonna take?

57:17.437 --> 57:19.134
You were present
during the attack?

57:19.178 --> 57:20.744
I was.I was.

57:20.788 --> 57:23.399
Discoverywas Control's
primary target.

57:23.443 --> 57:26.185
We were just in the way. When was that?

57:26.228 --> 57:28.317
I believe the exact date
is in the logs.

57:28.361 --> 57:30.667
Discoverywas attempting
to escape while badly damaged.

57:30.711 --> 57:32.147
The spore drive must've suffered

57:32.191 --> 57:33.366
a catastrophic failure
in battle.

57:33.409 --> 57:35.368
It just went...

57:35.411 --> 57:36.673
Boom.

57:36.717 --> 57:39.154
Seconds before Discovery's
disappearance,

57:39.198 --> 57:40.242
our long-range
sensors

57:40.286 --> 57:42.157
detected high-energy
gamma rays

57:42.201 --> 57:44.507
and gravitational waves
consistent with a

57:44.551 --> 57:47.641
quantum singularity.
How do you explain that?

57:47.684 --> 57:49.251
It is hardly my responsibility

57:49.295 --> 57:51.427
to provide what your
own sensors could not.

57:51.471 --> 57:54.430
I saw Discoveryexplode.I saw Discoveryexplode.

57:54.474 --> 57:57.259
They're all gone.

57:57.303 --> 57:59.305
That's your
official response?

57:59.348 --> 58:01.698
For the third time, yeah.

58:01.742 --> 58:03.309
Anything else?

58:03.352 --> 58:04.875
Commander
Michael Burnham,

58:04.919 --> 58:06.573
do you think she...?Do I think she what?

58:06.616 --> 58:08.270
PIKE:
Commander Burnham

58:08.314 --> 58:09.793
went above and beyond
before her death.

58:09.837 --> 58:14.624
Section 31, whether
by error or corruption,

58:14.668 --> 58:16.235
took its eye off the ball

58:16.278 --> 58:18.802
and is indirectly responsible
for this catastrophe.

58:18.846 --> 58:21.196
We agree the
organization requires

58:21.240 --> 58:22.676
a radical overhaul

58:22.719 --> 58:25.809
and perhaps far
more transparency.

58:25.853 --> 58:28.290
With the loss
of Admiral Cornwell

58:28.334 --> 58:31.163
and Captain Georgiou,

58:31.206 --> 58:33.600
we'd like to remove the "Acting"
from your title,

58:33.643 --> 58:34.862
make it permanent.

58:34.905 --> 58:37.343
Wasn't so long ago,

58:37.386 --> 58:40.172
I had to fight just to wear
a Starfleet uniform.

58:40.215 --> 58:44.306
And that dedication,
coupled with a perspective,

58:44.350 --> 58:48.180
Commander, it's safe to say
that your worldview

58:48.223 --> 58:51.183
is uniquely suited

58:51.226 --> 58:54.186
to the dualities
intrinsic to Section 31.

58:56.318 --> 58:58.712
Have you eliminated Control
entirely?

58:58.755 --> 59:00.496
We have.

59:00.540 --> 59:02.672
SPOCK: The destruction
ofDiscovery was tragic

59:02.716 --> 59:05.588
but does in and of itself
resolve the issue.

59:05.632 --> 59:07.329
Even more radical steps
must be taken

59:07.373 --> 59:10.245
to ensure that type of scenario
never repeats itself.

59:10.289 --> 59:14.206
I'm eager to hear your
recommendations, Lieutenant.

59:14.249 --> 59:18.210
Regulation 157, Section Three,

59:18.253 --> 59:20.299
requires Starfleet officers
to abstain

59:20.342 --> 59:22.736
from participating
in historical events.

59:22.779 --> 59:26.261
Any residual trace or knowledge
of Discovery'sdata,

59:26.305 --> 59:28.872
or the time suit,
offers a foothold

59:28.916 --> 59:31.223
for those who might not see
how critical,

59:31.266 --> 59:33.268
how deeply critical,
that directive is.

59:33.312 --> 59:36.358
Therefore, to insure the
Federation never finds itself

59:36.402 --> 59:38.839
facing the same danger,
all officers

59:38.882 --> 59:40.710
remaining with knowledge
of these events must be

59:40.754 --> 59:42.843
ordered never to speak
ofDiscovery, its spore drive,

59:42.886 --> 59:45.411
or her crew again.

59:45.454 --> 59:47.891
Under penalty of treason.

59:47.935 --> 59:49.893
Thank you,
Mr. Spock.

59:49.937 --> 59:52.287
We'll take it under advisement.

59:52.331 --> 59:55.377
SPOCK:
Personal log.

59:55.421 --> 59:58.772
Stardate: 1201.7.

01:00:05.344 --> 01:00:07.650
124 days have passed

01:00:07.694 --> 01:00:10.305
since your disappearance.

01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:12.307
It has been difficult,

01:00:12.351 --> 01:00:14.266
but we've managed
not to reveal the truth

01:00:14.309 --> 01:00:16.920
ofDiscovery's fate
to Starfleet.

01:00:16.964 --> 01:00:18.705
To have done so was to risk

01:00:18.748 --> 01:00:21.925
rendering your sacrifice
meaningless.

01:00:21.969 --> 01:00:23.927
If we learned anything,

01:00:23.971 --> 01:00:27.931
we learned we're not yet ready
to learn everything.

01:00:29.977 --> 01:00:32.675
Mother and Father
are diplomatically immune

01:00:32.719 --> 01:00:34.460
from interrogation,

01:00:34.503 --> 01:00:36.723
and they fully understand
our silence

01:00:36.766 --> 01:00:38.290
is meant to keep you safe.

01:00:39.987 --> 01:00:41.815
We have sworn never
to speak your name

01:00:41.858 --> 01:00:43.251
in the presence of others.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:50.737
Yet I feel you with me, always.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:54.784
With every moment, I grow
more sure-footed in this...

01:00:54.828 --> 01:00:56.438
in-between place.

01:00:56.482 --> 01:00:59.833
More certain
of who I am becoming.

01:01:02.401 --> 01:01:06.840
You teach me, sister, even now.

01:01:10.496 --> 01:01:13.977
Every night I look to the stars for your signal,

01:01:14.021 --> 01:01:17.807
and every night
I have to remind myself

01:01:17.851 --> 01:01:22.290
of the scientific truth
that time is relative.

01:01:24.118 --> 01:01:26.729
124 days for one

01:01:26.773 --> 01:01:29.341
is the blink of an eye
for another.

01:01:31.517 --> 01:01:34.824
It is difficult
to reconcile, logically.

01:01:34.868 --> 01:01:37.827
But to paraphrase
an Earth physicist,

01:01:37.871 --> 01:01:41.483
"The universe

01:01:41.527 --> 01:01:44.051
is under no obligation
to make sense to me."

01:01:46.401 --> 01:01:50.492
I believe that
you were successful.

01:01:50.536 --> 01:01:52.364
I choose to believe it.

01:01:54.888 --> 01:01:56.106
That is the only gift

01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:59.371
I have left to give you.

01:02:01.416 --> 01:02:04.376
It may not be logical, but I am

01:02:04.419 --> 01:02:06.943
proud to bear it.

01:02:08.423 --> 01:02:10.033
PIKE :
Mr. Spock to the bridge.

01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.399
You've detected
an anomaly, Captain?

01:02:27.442 --> 01:02:30.793
Number One's
running it now,

01:02:30.837 --> 01:02:32.447
but, uh,

01:02:32.491 --> 01:02:34.406
looks like it's
in the Beta Quadrant.

01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:35.972
NUMBER ONE:
That's correct, sir.

01:02:43.110 --> 01:02:45.504
And we have
confirmation.

01:02:48.202 --> 01:02:51.031
The location
of the seventh signal.

01:02:51.074 --> 01:02:54.077
51,000 light-years
from our present position.

01:03:00.954 --> 01:03:03.913
I'll run
the analytics.

01:03:08.875 --> 01:03:11.051
Where to, Number One?

01:03:11.094 --> 01:03:13.140
You're the captain,

01:03:13.183 --> 01:03:14.620
Captain.

01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:26.980
I hear we discovered
a new moon at Edrin Two.

01:03:27.023 --> 01:03:28.547
That we did, sir.

01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:29.591
Thank you, Number One.

01:03:31.898 --> 01:03:33.116
In that case,

01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.162
let's give her a spin.

01:03:35.205 --> 01:03:37.425
That sound good to you,
Mr. Spock?

01:03:39.122 --> 01:03:41.473
Yes, Captain.

01:03:41.516 --> 01:03:44.911
Let us see
what the future holds.

01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:50.090
Ready for warp, sir.

01:03:57.924 --> 01:04:00.056
Hit it.
