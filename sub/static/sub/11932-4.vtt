WEBVTT

00:02.359 --> 00:04.759
Go on, my son. Aim and fire.

00:05.519 --> 00:08.439
Oh! 135 points!

00:08.480 --> 00:10.480
In your face!

00:10.519 --> 00:14.279
One minute you're top of the world,
the next minute you're nobody.

00:14.320 --> 00:18.199
Maybe it's time to stop playing with
your balls and do something else.

00:18.239 --> 00:21.719
I can't stop. I need to get back
up that leader board.

00:21.760 --> 00:25.120
There's a theatre festival
starting next week.

00:25.160 --> 00:28.679
Get some culture
before your brain shrinks.

00:28.719 --> 00:32.560
We get loads of culture, thank you.
When did you guys last see a show?

00:32.600 --> 00:36.119
I watched a couple of dogs
humping the other day.

00:36.159 --> 00:39.439
That's not really a show, Grumio.
I was clapping.

00:39.479 --> 00:43.119
Maybe it's not your thing.
Well, no, no, let me see.

00:43.159 --> 00:46.840
'Some of Rome's most revered
and uncompromising directors

00:46.880 --> 00:49.240
present all the Aelius' tragedies.'

00:49.280 --> 00:53.159
That'll be a barrel of laughs.
It'll be a barrel of art

00:53.200 --> 00:56.759
and adult sophistication,
which is very much our thing.

00:56.799 --> 00:59.320
180. I've got 180!  Ooh!

00:59.359 --> 01:03.920
He's done! He's only
gone and done it! Ha-ha!  Ha-ha!

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.560 --> 01:23.400
50 denarii a ticket?
And that's sitting behind a pillar.

01:23.439 --> 01:27.280
I'd prefer it, to be honest.
I'll have to find something cheaper.

01:27.319 --> 01:30.840
Do you think those dogs'd
do an encore? Stop! Stop right there!

01:30.879 --> 01:34.520
That's him. isn't it?
That's our Cupid.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.439
Cherubic little face,
body of a big, beautiful baby.

01:38.479 --> 01:42.439
Wow. Yeah, he's uncanny.
You what? No, I'm not.

01:42.479 --> 01:47.960
I am Iona Ruffina,
the actress/director/writer?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.200
Cool job.  I haven't finished.

01:50.240 --> 01:54.000
/producer. For months I've been
searching for a Cupid

01:54.039 --> 01:57.240
for my upcoming production -
The Bastard King.

01:57.280 --> 02:00.879
Just when I'm about to give up
the search and use a dummy,

02:00.920 --> 02:04.200
what do I see,
right in front of my own theatre?

02:04.239 --> 02:08.120
The all-conquering
god of love himself.

02:08.158 --> 02:10.280
My name's Grumio.  Charmed.

02:10.318 --> 02:14.560
And Sebastus, you will,
of course, know.  Call me Seb.

02:14.599 --> 02:18.759
Oh, hi. I'm Stylax. This is Marcus.
Great. I won't remember that.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.439
Now if you'll excuse me, I need to
stretch it out before rehearsals.

02:23.479 --> 02:26.840
Now Grumio, my dear child,

02:26.879 --> 02:30.199
would you consider playing the role?
No, you're all right.

02:30.240 --> 02:33.680
Sounds like a right faff.
Just consider it, for me?

02:33.719 --> 02:36.400
For dear little old me?
He did say no.

02:36.439 --> 02:40.240
He may just consider it.  I don't
think he's capable of that.

02:40.280 --> 02:44.120
It will be very well paid.
Just consider it.  Please do

02:44.159 --> 02:47.879
and we'll talk tomorrow.
Until then, adieu.

02:47.920 --> 02:49.920
Bless you.

02:59.759 --> 03:03.520
Bread. Nice.  Uh-uh. Not before
you agree to be in this play.

03:03.560 --> 03:07.879
I haven't got time, it'll
get in the way of my housework.

03:07.919 --> 03:09.960
No more than your napping.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.919
Come on. Then we can hang out in the
theatre. Did you see the hotties?

03:13.960 --> 03:17.639
Only because of that actor guy.
I could be an actor guy.

03:17.680 --> 03:21.400
I can stretch and speak nicely
and not remember people's names.

03:21.439 --> 03:24.479
Come on, it'll be a doddle.
I promise.

03:24.520 --> 03:26.759
Egg in bread, look.

03:32.079 --> 03:35.120
Oh, this is too, too splendid.

03:35.159 --> 03:39.000
Finally, we have an upgrade
on the dummy.  Don't speak too soon.

03:39.039 --> 03:42.560
How much can you pay him?
Yes, I was thinking.

03:42.599 --> 03:44.840
95 denarii? How does that sound?

03:44.879 --> 03:48.159
Could we make it 100?

03:48.199 --> 03:51.639
Hm. Your agent is a tough cookie,
Grumio.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.360
Very well, 100 it is.

03:54.400 --> 03:57.879
We're going to go on such a journey,
my little cherub.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.439
As long as it's an easy journey.
Oh, it's too easy.

04:01.479 --> 04:05.080
You are the Deus ex machina,
the god from the machine,

04:05.120 --> 04:07.599
on stage for a mere moment

04:07.639 --> 04:10.759
to soften the heart
of the bastard king,

04:10.800 --> 04:14.080
who's imposed a sex ban
on his daughters.  Wicked! Amazing!

04:14.120 --> 04:17.560
Oh, it's quite wonderful.
Can I be in it as well?

04:17.600 --> 04:21.279
I'd make a great king, or prince.
There's no prince in the play.

04:21.319 --> 04:24.959
Friend of the prince?
There is no prince.  General guy?

04:25.000 --> 04:28.920
It's all been cast.  I just want
to be involved. I love the theatre.

04:28.959 --> 04:32.720
Of course. You could understudy
Sebastus.

04:32.759 --> 04:36.360
We do need someone for that.
Great. What's the pay like?

04:36.399 --> 04:39.079
There is no pay.  Deal.

04:41.040 --> 04:44.680
What? Grumio's in the play?

04:44.720 --> 04:48.720
Yeah, and I'm actually pretty tight
with the director, Iona...

04:48.759 --> 04:50.759
Iona Ruffina?

04:50.800 --> 04:55.159
You know Iona Ruffina?  Yeah, I...
Do you know Iona Ruffina?

04:55.199 --> 04:58.480
I know her work. I saw her Hecuba.

04:58.519 --> 05:01.439
It was so powerful and so bloody.

05:01.480 --> 05:03.920
Wow. The classic Iona combo.

05:03.959 --> 05:09.480
We've been invited to a soiree at
her place, if you fancy meeting her?

05:09.519 --> 05:12.920
Maybe you're
such an uncultured idiot after all.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.040
Thank you.

05:17.079 --> 05:21.120
Behold, for it is he,
Cupid himself made flesh.

05:24.879 --> 05:28.199
When do I use the bow and arrow?
Oh, you don't use it.

05:28.240 --> 05:32.920
Oh, right. What about the wings?
Are you asking if you can fly?

05:32.959 --> 05:37.360
I suppose I am, yeah.  Then no,
you walk on, using your legs.

05:37.399 --> 05:40.120
And that's lunch, people.

05:40.159 --> 05:42.480
Right. I'll be in my dressing room.

05:42.519 --> 05:47.120
Your food awaits you, Seb - steak,
medium-rare with chips.

05:47.159 --> 05:49.639
Yum!

05:49.680 --> 05:53.480
Is my steak in my dressing room?
You don't get a dressing room

05:53.519 --> 05:57.439
or a steak.  What food do I get?
The food of encouragement,

05:57.480 --> 05:59.959
and you're doing terribly well.

06:08.079 --> 06:11.279
Hey, er, Seb? One moment.

06:13.519 --> 06:15.160
Come!

06:15.199 --> 06:18.240
Hey, Seb.

06:18.279 --> 06:21.160
We met yesterday.  A-ha. Could be.

06:21.199 --> 06:23.319
Outside the theatre. I'm Stylax.

06:23.360 --> 06:25.519
I meet a lot of people.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.600
So I'm your new understudy.

06:28.879 --> 06:32.079
Congrats, dude!
That must be huge for you.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.759
I should say, though,
I've never missed a performance,

06:35.800 --> 06:40.199
so don't get any ideas. I'm only
interested in that type of thing.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.159
Humping the fans, you know.  Oh,
buddy, you've got this all wrong.

06:45.199 --> 06:48.600
Shit, sorry, I just assumed
you were...  No, I was.

06:48.639 --> 06:52.480
I was humping her silly. I mean
you've got it the wrong way round.

06:52.519 --> 06:56.480
You can't have your pudding unless
you eat your greens, can you?

06:56.519 --> 07:00.360
You can if you're a grown-up.
We're not grown-ups, we're actors

07:00.399 --> 07:04.319
and she wasn't in here because
I'm a ham, it's because I'm the lead

07:04.360 --> 07:09.199
and that takes years of graft. Sorry
to break it to you, buddy. No, sure.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.720
Nice coat, by the way.
Oh, thank you. It's 100% yak.

07:15.720 --> 07:18.920
Why should they get a dressing room
and not me?

07:18.959 --> 07:22.879
If you don't get dressed, what would
you use it for? Eat my steak in.

07:22.920 --> 07:27.519
That's what actors get.  You're
not a proper actor. I'm a god.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.439
A god should get a dressing room.
Tell that fruity bint I'm walking.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.840
Don't call Iona a fruity bint,
she's a major artist.

07:34.879 --> 07:37.680
Not to mention
a close, personal friend.

07:37.720 --> 07:40.959
I'll ask about the steak,
leave it to me.

07:41.000 --> 07:44.959
And I want a long, jazzy coat.
We don't get one. I bought a fake

07:45.000 --> 07:48.680
that looks similar to Seb's.
It's an amazing coat.  Thank you.

07:48.720 --> 07:50.959
It's 15% yak.

07:51.920 --> 07:54.639
Ah, ciao, Marcus.

07:54.680 --> 07:57.519
Grumio and the understudy.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.879
And you.

07:59.920 --> 08:03.600
Who are you?  Yes, Iona,
this is my girlfriend, Delphine.

08:03.639 --> 08:06.680
I'm a huge fan of your work.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.360
Thank you, child. Too, too kind.

08:09.399 --> 08:13.759
May I ask et tu Gauloise?
Yes. You speak Gallic?

08:13.800 --> 08:16.040
Tres petit peu.

08:16.079 --> 08:18.920
I toured Gaul many moons ago.

08:18.959 --> 08:21.959
Terrific audiences.
Even better lovers.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.040
Yes. Entre, entre.

08:25.079 --> 08:28.920
We have wine, punch.  Hm.
Yes, I know, I...

08:28.959 --> 08:32.679
I wonder, Iona, could we discuss
Grumio's contract a sec?

08:32.720 --> 08:36.279
Now? After rehearsals have begun?
It's most irregular.

08:36.320 --> 08:40.480
Other actors get dressing rooms. And
a private soiree at the director's?

08:40.519 --> 08:44.639
Oh, dear me, no.  And Seb
gets a steak. Seb is the star.

08:44.679 --> 08:48.240
Look, I'll see if there's a box room
he can have.

08:48.279 --> 08:50.600
Take that now or make me angry.

08:50.639 --> 08:54.200
And the steak? You know what divas
these actors can be.

08:54.240 --> 08:58.279
Only when their agents indulge them.
OK. A small room and a small steak.

08:58.320 --> 09:00.360
No chips.

09:08.559 --> 09:11.039
Hey, Seb. How's it going?

09:11.559 --> 09:14.039
Stylax. Your understudy.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.480
Oh, that's my coat.
You've bought my coat.

09:17.519 --> 09:21.039
As your understudy,
I should cover all the bases.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.919
That's great, I respect that,
but that is my coat. It's fake,

09:24.960 --> 09:27.960
but yeah.  Hm. Don't buy my shoes.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.159
I won't. I promise.

09:31.200 --> 09:33.000
Seb.  Ah.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.600
I've been collecting these
for aeons.

09:38.639 --> 09:41.039
This one's from Turkey.

09:41.080 --> 09:43.960
Look. I took my Hecuba there.

09:44.000 --> 09:48.080
I saw that production. It was
so powerful.  And so bloody,

09:48.120 --> 09:50.759
as I recall. It was a call to arms,

09:50.799 --> 09:53.519
for women to defy the male
oppressors

09:53.559 --> 09:58.200
and seize our independence
politically, financially, sexually.

09:59.440 --> 10:02.279
You must savour your freedom, child.

10:02.320 --> 10:05.600
At your age,
I was travelling the world,

10:05.639 --> 10:09.639
experiencing a kaleidoscope
of cultures and orgasms.

10:09.679 --> 10:12.919
That's what really made me who I am.

10:13.399 --> 10:15.720
Er, shall we get a drink? No, no.

10:15.759 --> 10:18.279
Darling, have you been
to Tingitana?

10:18.320 --> 10:21.679
I've only ever been
to Gaul and Rome.

10:21.720 --> 10:23.840
Go. Drop everything and go.

10:23.879 --> 10:26.000
The men are vast.

10:26.679 --> 10:30.759
This statue is absolutely
to scale.

10:30.799 --> 10:34.399
Ha-ha!  Good stuff.
Let's go get that drink.

10:34.440 --> 10:36.799
And the hammams are too divine.

10:36.840 --> 10:38.639
What's a hammam?

10:38.679 --> 10:40.840
Bless the child. What is a hammam?

10:40.879 --> 10:43.519
Tomorrow, I shall take you to mine.

10:43.559 --> 10:48.279
There's a masseur there by the name
of Abu who will open you up.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.159
This party's jizz, innit? Ran
out of chicken drumsticks ages ago.

10:58.200 --> 11:01.320
I'm starting to think
acting's jizz as well.

11:01.360 --> 11:05.240
Unless you're the star you're
scenery.  Quick game of marbles?

11:05.279 --> 11:08.360
Big time. You know where you stand
with marbles.

11:08.399 --> 11:12.120
Swing by my dressing room
if you'd like to have sex with me.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.000
Sebastus.  Buddy.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.960
Oh, my foot! Oh, my lovely foot!

11:23.000 --> 11:25.159
Holy jove! What happened, Seb?

11:25.200 --> 11:28.480
I slipped on something,
it must've been this...

11:28.519 --> 11:32.519
..bauble. You're drunk.
Alas, what am I to do?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.759
- No, I'm fine, I'm absolutely...
- Oh!

11:35.799 --> 11:37.799
My leg's broken. Oh!

11:38.519 --> 11:40.519
The understudy.

11:40.559 --> 11:43.879
Thank the gods
we have an understudy!

11:45.399 --> 11:47.720
Welcome aboard, darling.

11:55.399 --> 11:59.639
Hoo! Being a king's the best. I get
to wear a metal hat and everything.

11:59.679 --> 12:02.720
You know you have to learn lines.
I'll be fine.

12:02.759 --> 12:06.639
Bloody nightmare and I've only got
one.  You can't learn one line?

12:06.679 --> 12:10.080
I know it now - shut your mouth,
for the love of God!

12:10.120 --> 12:14.000
'Open your heart for the god
of love.'  See? It's murder.

12:14.039 --> 12:17.200
I should be paid more.
Don't start that again.

12:17.240 --> 12:20.440
I got you a steak, no? Well done.
Thanks.  No, the steak.

12:20.480 --> 12:24.480
I want it well done. Speak to Iona.
That's what got me in the shit.

12:24.519 --> 12:27.960
She introduced Delphine to a range
of international dildos.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.639
Iona would've done that anyway.
And tell her I want to fly.

12:31.679 --> 12:35.919
You see what I'm dealing with?
My character wouldn't plod on stage.

12:35.960 --> 12:39.879
He should fly on
on a winch.  That's you being lazy.

12:39.919 --> 12:43.320
Get me a winch or I walk.
Those are the two options.

12:43.360 --> 12:47.240
And a cream bun.  For the character
or for you? For both.

12:56.320 --> 12:59.559
Behold, I am your...
What was it again?

12:59.600 --> 13:03.159
King.  Yeah, I am your king and...

13:03.200 --> 13:05.240
If.  And if...

13:05.279 --> 13:07.279
Just if.  And just if.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.559
No, no, it's just if.
OK. I'll start again. Behold...

13:10.600 --> 13:14.320
This is taking too long. Seb!
Seb? Oh, is he here?

13:14.360 --> 13:17.240
I need you to get Stylax
up to speed.

13:17.279 --> 13:21.519
It's the least you can do after your
drunken lechery got us in this mess.

13:21.559 --> 13:23.600
Now chop, chop.

13:27.320 --> 13:30.840
Behold, I am your king!

13:30.879 --> 13:34.879
If you crush me I will crush you!

13:34.919 --> 13:37.759
That's really good, man.  I know.

13:37.799 --> 13:41.039
Shame no-one's going to hear it.
That is harsh.

13:41.080 --> 13:43.080
Sorry, are you guys in the play?

13:43.120 --> 13:47.240
Hi. Yeah, I am. I'm the king.
Not now, please, hon.

13:47.279 --> 13:51.320
We've got some serious acting work
to do here. Well, have we?

13:51.600 --> 13:55.159
Look, dude,
you're bad, REALLY bad,

13:55.200 --> 13:59.000
so we need to knuckle down to get
you ready. No more distractions.

13:59.559 --> 14:02.320
Behold!

14:03.759 --> 14:06.440
I wanted to say what an honour it is

14:06.480 --> 14:10.120
to work with someone
of your artistry. Of course.

14:10.159 --> 14:14.519
We're new to the industry, so if
I offended you I am truly sorry

14:14.559 --> 14:18.440
and as a token of goodwill I'd like
to revert to Grumio's original deal.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.480
Bless you, that's too, too decent
of you, Marcus.

14:21.519 --> 14:23.919
And in exchange, could you maybe not

14:23.960 --> 14:26.879
suggest to Delphine
that she, you know...

14:26.919 --> 14:28.960
No, I'm afraid I don't know.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.600
Well, I guess sleep around?

14:31.639 --> 14:34.600
I beg your pardon?
She's my girlfriend

14:34.639 --> 14:38.679
so I'd prefer it if you didn't
encourage her to have sex with Turks.

14:38.720 --> 14:42.000
She's not your property
and neither am I.  I know.

14:42.039 --> 14:45.600
I will not be censored
by you or jove himself.

14:45.639 --> 14:48.440
I'm an artist
and I speak from the heart.  OK.

14:48.480 --> 14:52.559
In that case, it's best from now on
that you keep away from Delphine.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.519
Absolutely not. I've already made
the booking of the hammam.

14:56.559 --> 15:00.399
Or I might have to pull my client
out of your show. Careful,

15:00.440 --> 15:04.279
you've not got what it takes
to play hard ball with me.

15:04.320 --> 15:09.120
Well, I've got the hardest balls
you've ever...felt, so try me.

15:12.639 --> 15:14.879
Now?  Little bit longer.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.120
You're the boss.

15:17.159 --> 15:21.440
Salve, Grumio.  All right?  Haven't
seen you around here for a while.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.480
Been starring in a play.
With your flamboyance,

15:24.519 --> 15:26.759
it was only a matter of time.

15:26.799 --> 15:30.320
Except my crappy agent's
not getting me what I want.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.879
That's showbiz for you.  That'll do.

15:34.639 --> 15:38.120
What's his problem, then?
Won't pay his rent.

15:38.159 --> 15:40.480
Reckon he will now, though.

15:49.080 --> 15:52.080
Delphine. Hey. What's going on?

15:52.559 --> 15:56.080
Ciao, Marcus. We've just been
to the hammam.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.279
Abu was incredible.

15:58.320 --> 16:01.639
What about our chat?
Have you forgotten that?

16:01.679 --> 16:04.440
There's no need to mince your words.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.799
I told Delphine what you said.
You... Oh, God.

16:07.840 --> 16:11.120
And you can't stop me
from seeing people.

16:11.159 --> 16:15.279
I'm not your pet mouse that's let
out of the cage when you say so.

16:15.320 --> 16:18.679
It's not like that.
You can leave the cage whenever.

16:18.720 --> 16:22.039
But there is still a cage.
There is no cage.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.919
I was worried she's pushing us apart.
Maybe it's for the best.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.919
What do you mean? Iona's asked me
to go to Turkey with her.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.720
I'm going to be her PA.  Turkey?
That's bloody miles away.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.600
Don't worry,
she'll be taken care of.

16:36.639 --> 16:39.519
The gentlemen there
are very generous.

16:39.559 --> 16:43.039
You can forget about your Cupid,
you thespy shitbag.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.799
Oh, really.  Yeah. Dust off
that dummy because Grumio is out.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.559
Interesting. That's not what
his new agent's been saying.

16:53.639 --> 16:55.759
What do you think you're doing?

16:55.799 --> 16:59.480
Now, don't get mardy.
Who is it? Who's your new agent?

16:59.519 --> 17:03.000
Salve, Marcus. Don't raise
your voice at my client, please.

17:03.039 --> 17:06.640
You've got to be kidding me.
He's a very strong negotiator.

17:06.680 --> 17:10.000
He's got me my winch.
And his fee up front.

17:10.039 --> 17:13.079
You were my first agent,
I'll never forget you,

17:13.118 --> 17:16.880
but I needed someone hungrier.
I'm hungry. I'm bloody starving.

17:16.920 --> 17:20.079
My prima donna slave
won't cook me dinner.

17:21.559 --> 17:26.079
Here's your 10%.  Er, I thought
it were you that got the 10%.

17:26.118 --> 17:28.400
Hm. Don't think so.

17:28.440 --> 17:31.200
Oh, the rent's due.

17:34.359 --> 17:38.880
Oh, it chafes a bit.  It chafes.
The winch is chafing my client.

17:38.920 --> 17:43.759
Get him a cushion. A once kind
king...  Delphine's going to Turkey

17:43.799 --> 17:48.440
on a six-month tour with the largest
penises. To my kin... Line?

17:48.599 --> 17:52.079
To my kin become so cruel.
To my kin become so cruel.

17:52.119 --> 17:55.279
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

17:55.319 --> 17:58.720
That's not your line.
"Spurned the love of my fair queen."

17:58.759 --> 18:02.680
Spurned the love of my fair queen.
So what do I do?  So what do I do?

18:02.720 --> 18:06.359
That's not a line. Stop rhyming,
then.  Listen to me, then.

18:06.400 --> 18:10.200
What do I do about Delphine going
to Turkey? I need a miracle.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.240
Pray to the gods. Test me.

18:12.279 --> 18:16.759
A once kind king
and now a fool become so cruel.

18:16.799 --> 18:20.920
Spurned the love of my fair queen
with violent rage and words obscene.

18:20.960 --> 18:24.799
Cupid, come down from above
and soften this heart with love.

18:24.839 --> 18:27.039
I think you know it. Yes!

18:27.079 --> 18:31.720
Behold, I am your king!
Nice one, Your Majesty.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.920
I am so proud of you, buddy.

18:38.960 --> 18:43.440
I wont lie, there were times when
I thought you were a workshy boob

18:43.480 --> 18:46.000
who only cared about girls and coats.

18:46.039 --> 18:48.240
No offence. None taken.

18:48.279 --> 18:51.680
But you have knuckled down
and risen to the challenge.

18:51.720 --> 18:55.440
I couldn't have done it without you.
Of course. It's mostly me,

18:55.480 --> 18:57.920
but you played your part, Ajax.

18:57.960 --> 18:59.799
Ajax?

18:59.839 --> 19:03.680
Do you still not know my name?
No, but I like you,

19:03.720 --> 19:06.759
whoever you are.
Now you get out there

19:06.799 --> 19:10.559
and show those disappointed people
who bought tickets to see me

19:10.599 --> 19:14.039
that you're here instead.
You're not as good, obviously,

19:14.079 --> 19:17.119
but not bad. I'll do my best.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.880
I'll be watching from the wings.

19:22.319 --> 19:24.960
Break a leg, brother. You, too.

19:30.599 --> 19:34.079
Oh, er, Seb, I think
you've got my coat!

19:34.119 --> 19:36.039
Oh, hey.  Hey.

19:36.079 --> 19:40.279
I'm actually on stage in five
minutes, so...  Five minutes is fine.

19:50.839 --> 19:54.559
Sorry I tried to control you.
I get it, Marcus.

19:54.599 --> 19:58.240
You thought if I went away
we'd break up.  Yes,

19:58.279 --> 20:02.119
and I really don't want that. I know.
I don't want that, either.  Great.

20:02.160 --> 20:05.519
So you won't go to Turkey?
No, I'm still going.

20:05.559 --> 20:09.200
I'll try not to sleep with others.
How hard will you try?  Shhh!

20:09.240 --> 20:11.240
Do you mind?

20:18.319 --> 20:20.319
This isn't 100% yak.

20:48.640 --> 20:51.279
I'm coming.

21:01.519 --> 21:05.880
Ladies and gentlemen, forgive us
for this somewhat false start.

21:05.920 --> 21:09.400
We have an understudy
taking the part of the king.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.160
I imagine his nerves are getting
the better of him.

21:16.160 --> 21:19.720
It was you. You're the one
who balled with me.

21:22.359 --> 21:25.799
Behold, I am your...argh!

21:34.240 --> 21:36.880
Fear not, stay in your seats.

21:36.920 --> 21:41.440
Gardy gordy gordy.
The show must go on!

21:43.200 --> 21:44.920
Mark!

21:52.160 --> 21:54.400
Well, that went quite badly.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.599
Apparently, first nights always do.

21:56.640 --> 22:00.519
Even so, shooting the director's
a real no-no. Tell me about it!

22:00.559 --> 22:04.160
My agent's dropped me.  It's not
all bad, though. Turkey's off.

22:04.200 --> 22:08.079
It is. The humid bathrooms and
vast penises will have to wait.

22:08.119 --> 22:11.359
And in a way it was a classic Iona
production -

22:11.400 --> 22:13.759
powerful and bloody. Sure.

22:13.799 --> 22:17.920
Let's never go back to the theatre
again, eh?  Steak for Grumio!

22:17.960 --> 22:21.440
Well done!  Oh. Might just pop back
one last time.

22:24.599 --> 22:26.640
There you go, sir.
