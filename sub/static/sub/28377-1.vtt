00:19.749 --> 00:23.420
PET
SEMATARY

02:04.056 --> 02:05.655
So many trees.

02:05.657 --> 02:07.490
It's beautiful, right?

02:07.492 --> 02:09.693
Well, it's definitely
not Boston.

02:09.695 --> 02:11.594
No, it's not.

02:11.596 --> 02:14.499
Mom, make him stop.
It's not fair to Church.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.734
I'm pretty sure Church is okay.

02:17.736 --> 02:19.803
It's not actually Church
that I'm worried about.

02:19.805 --> 02:21.471
We've still got
another eight hours to go.

02:21.473 --> 02:22.539
What?

02:23.608 --> 02:24.810
Not funny, Dad.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.676
That is so funny.

02:26.678 --> 02:28.813
I got you good.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.484
- Gage, did you find that funny?
- I thought it was funny.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.755
What do you think?

03:10.757 --> 03:14.126
- Wow.
- "Wow"? That's it?

03:14.128 --> 03:16.128
It's pretty incredible,
don't you think?

03:16.130 --> 03:17.963
I even got them
to throw in a whole forest

03:17.965 --> 03:19.698
as a new backyard.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.866
This whole place is ours?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.001
This whole place
is the new domain

03:23.003 --> 03:25.038
of Ellie-phant
the Great and Terrible.

03:26.473 --> 03:27.638
I'll tell you what.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.743
Do you want
to be the first inside?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.080
Go, go, go.

03:36.050 --> 03:37.682
The movers
were here all morning,

03:37.684 --> 03:39.384
so everything
should be inside.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.819
Good.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.858
Son of a bitch. You okay?

03:46.860 --> 03:49.695
Yeah, it just startled me
a little bit.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.598
You okay, Gage?

03:53.534 --> 03:54.900
- Big truck, huh?
- Who's a brave boy?

03:54.902 --> 03:56.670
That was a big
truck, wasn't it?

03:57.805 --> 04:01.073
Okay. You ready,
little man?

04:01.075 --> 04:05.911
- Here we go. Come on.
- One, two, three!

04:05.913 --> 04:06.812
Home.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.347
Hmm.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.883
Well, he adapted quickly.

04:10.885 --> 04:14.719
What about you?
You ready for the country life, Doc?

04:14.721 --> 04:17.689
- Well, let's find out. Come on.-

04:17.690 --> 04:18.890
Mrs. Creed.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.029
Wait, the cat's in the car!

04:31.473 --> 04:34.575
This all happened
pretty fast. You gonna miss it?

04:34.577 --> 04:38.844
I don't think anyone really misses
the graveyard shift in the ER.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.414
I don't think that really
answered my question.

04:41.416 --> 04:43.384
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

04:46.154 --> 04:47.922
- Hey.
- Hmm?

04:48.690 --> 04:50.225
You needed this.

04:51.393 --> 04:54.127
We needed this.

04:54.129 --> 04:57.066
I get to spend some more
time around the house

04:59.168 --> 05:03.302
- with the kids.
- And your stay-at-home wifey.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.071
- Ooh, I didn't even think about that.
- Yeah?

05:05.073 --> 05:06.739
- I may have to rethink that.
- Oh, you will?

05:06.741 --> 05:08.609
You stop that. Don't you do that.

05:08.611 --> 05:10.544
Yeah...

05:21.457 --> 05:23.525
Good morning, Marcella.

05:23.527 --> 05:24.824
Ready for the storm?

05:24.826 --> 05:26.360
We have someone already?

05:26.362 --> 05:28.062
Bloody nose. Room 4.

05:29.097 --> 05:30.698
Sounds serious.

05:45.649 --> 05:46.916
Do you hear that?

06:13.776 --> 06:16.076
What are they doing?

06:16.078 --> 06:18.448
Looks like some
sort of procession.

06:21.784 --> 06:23.984
What's a procession?

06:23.986 --> 06:26.856
It's like a parade,
but not for fun.

06:38.301 --> 06:40.767
Hey, let's go back inside
and watch a show.

06:40.769 --> 06:42.973
I'm tired of unpacking boxes.

06:53.183 --> 06:54.983
Sooner than that.

06:54.985 --> 06:57.421
I mean, Ellie's birthday is
coming up in a few months.

07:19.644 --> 07:23.746
Well, I don't know why you're worried, Mom.
No, everything's fine.

07:23.748 --> 07:25.516
The kids are really happy.

07:26.249 --> 07:27.982
Yeah.

07:27.984 --> 07:29.752
No, it's nice
to slow down a little bit,

07:29.754 --> 07:31.021
you know?

07:37.461 --> 07:40.398
Hey, Mom, can I, uh...
Can I talk to you later?

07:41.999 --> 07:44.268
Okay, love you. Bye.

07:49.173 --> 07:51.309
Hey, Ellie, are you hungry?

09:09.921 --> 09:12.523
Hey. You get down from there!

09:27.807 --> 09:29.007
The trick is...

09:31.177 --> 09:34.178
To get the stinger out
real quick.

09:34.180 --> 09:36.182
Oh, she's a big 'un.

09:36.783 --> 09:38.384
No prize winner...

09:40.186 --> 09:42.623
But she'll do for a ribbon.

09:44.725 --> 09:46.192
There you go.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.758
Yeah.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.761
Should be starting
to quiet down now.

09:50.763 --> 09:52.797
You're the doctor's
little girl.

09:52.799 --> 09:55.401
Eleanor Creed.
But you can call me Ellie.

09:55.935 --> 09:57.671
I'm Judson Crandall.

09:58.672 --> 10:00.039
You can call me Jud.

10:01.642 --> 10:04.243
All right. Up you get.

10:08.515 --> 10:11.216
- What is this place?
- Pet cemetery.

10:11.218 --> 10:15.288
- Didn't you read the sign?
- Yeah. They spelled it wrong.

10:17.290 --> 10:18.824
These are all people's pets?

10:18.826 --> 10:22.627
Well, the whole town's been
using this place for generations.

10:22.629 --> 10:23.728
I saw those kids.

10:23.730 --> 10:25.597
They were all
wearing those masks.

10:25.599 --> 10:27.065
Yeah.

10:27.067 --> 10:31.136
A lot of folks make a
kind of ritual out of it.

10:31.138 --> 10:34.674
See this one over here?
I carved this myself.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.943
That's my dog, Biffer.

10:37.945 --> 10:41.582
And it's true.
He was a hell of a sniffer.

10:43.717 --> 10:45.952
Ellie?

10:45.954 --> 10:50.322
You know better than to wander
off by yourself. Come here.

10:50.324 --> 10:53.124
Mommy, this is Jud,
our neighbor.

10:53.126 --> 10:54.460
I got stung by a bee.

10:54.462 --> 10:57.597
He pulled the stinger out.
It was a big 'un.

10:57.599 --> 10:59.631
Hmm. Nice to meet you, ma'am.

10:59.633 --> 11:02.703
Nice to meet you, too.
I'm Rachel, Ellie's mom.

11:04.238 --> 11:05.773
You know, these woods...

11:07.241 --> 11:10.710
It's not really all that safe
to go roaming around in 'em.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.446
People can get lost up here.

11:13.448 --> 11:17.418
Thank you, Jud.
Um, we should get back, okay?

11:20.388 --> 11:22.388
Honey, you can't
wander off like that.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.624
I don't know where you are.
I can't do anything...

11:24.626 --> 11:29.731
Just wash the mud off and rub
some baking soda on that sting.

11:31.666 --> 11:33.735
<i>Jud...</i>

11:35.503 --> 11:37.672
<i>Come back...</i>

11:48.249 --> 11:50.349
- Dad?
- Yeah?

11:50.351 --> 11:52.487
Why don't pets
live as long as people?

11:55.557 --> 11:56.558
Well...

11:57.760 --> 12:00.561
Do you remember that talk
we had about metabolism?

12:00.563 --> 12:03.229
- The clock in your body?
- Yes.

12:03.231 --> 12:05.566
Humans have
a slow metabolism,

12:05.568 --> 12:08.802
a slow clock,
so we live longer.

12:08.804 --> 12:11.005
Whereas cats and dogs...

12:11.007 --> 12:12.906
Well, they have
a fast metabolism.

12:12.908 --> 12:14.875
Which means,
when it runs out...

12:14.877 --> 12:16.812
They die and go
to the pet cemetery.

12:17.746 --> 12:18.712
Yeah.

12:18.714 --> 12:21.247
Ellie discovered
a charming little landmark

12:21.249 --> 12:23.684
in the woods today,
right in our backyard.

12:23.686 --> 12:27.688
Okay. Well, that doesn't have to
be such a bad thing, does it? Hmm?

12:27.690 --> 12:29.924
A place to bury our pets
and remember them.

12:29.926 --> 12:33.495
It might seem scary, but it's not.
It's perfectly natural.

12:34.798 --> 12:37.399
Just like dying
is natural. Hmm?

12:39.535 --> 12:41.468
We all die and eventually,
one way or another,

12:41.470 --> 12:43.337
we all go back
into the ground.

12:43.339 --> 12:44.771
What Daddy's
trying to say

12:44.773 --> 12:48.076
is that even though the pet's
body goes in the ground,

12:48.078 --> 12:50.747
its soul keeps living
and goes to heaven.

12:51.815 --> 12:53.815
Just like Nana Creed.

12:53.817 --> 12:56.851
Remember how I told you
she's looking down on you?

12:56.853 --> 12:58.118
Well, we don't
actually know

12:58.120 --> 13:01.188
that it works
exactly like that.

13:01.190 --> 13:02.756
What Mommy and Daddy
are trying to say

13:02.758 --> 13:05.026
is that you don't have to worry about
this, sweetheart, okay?

13:05.028 --> 13:09.063
Church and Mommy and me,
we're gonna be around a long, long time.

13:09.065 --> 13:10.197
And Gage?

13:10.199 --> 13:12.902
Of course, sweetie.
Gage is just a kid.

13:16.172 --> 13:19.340
But what about
your sister, Mommy?

13:19.342 --> 13:22.545
Wasn't she just a kid
when she died?

14:03.754 --> 14:06.222
Rachel...

14:09.326 --> 14:10.761
Rachel.

14:13.663 --> 14:14.832
You okay?

14:15.766 --> 14:17.300
What was that in there?

14:19.302 --> 14:22.771
Funny, I wanted to ask you
the same thing.

14:22.773 --> 14:24.673
Rachel, Ellie's
almost nine years old.

14:24.675 --> 14:26.341
We should be able
to talk to her about this.

14:26.343 --> 14:28.243
Ellie's a child.

14:28.245 --> 14:30.612
And death for her is scary.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.514
Please, Rachel, doesn't mean
we should shield her from it.

14:32.516 --> 14:34.583
And you think
that's what I'm doing?

14:34.585 --> 14:38.589
I think that all this talk
about the afterlife,

14:39.457 --> 14:41.523
about people
looking down on her,

14:41.525 --> 14:43.792
I think...
Yeah, I think it's delaying

14:43.794 --> 14:46.528
getting to the heart
of the matter, yes.

14:46.530 --> 14:50.534
So, you... You really don't
think there's anything

14:51.368 --> 14:55.974
after we die?
No heaven, no nothing?

14:59.510 --> 15:00.711
No.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.081
Right. We're gonna take a swab
and run a test for strep.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.785
It could be allergies,

15:07.919 --> 15:08.920
but we just want to be sure.

15:11.857 --> 15:14.256
Marcella, please tell me
it's almost lunch.

15:14.258 --> 15:15.925
If I have to look at another
pair of swollen tonsils,

15:15.927 --> 15:18.328
- I swear to God...
- Judy went out for sandwiches.

15:20.398 --> 15:22.233
His head!

15:22.235 --> 15:23.398
Victor, uh, Pascow.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.135
It's Victor Pascow.
He's a student here.

15:25.137 --> 15:27.570
He was skating and the
car just came out of nowhere!

15:27.572 --> 15:29.472
- He got dragged.
- Call Life Flight to Bangor.

15:29.474 --> 15:30.807
No time for an ambulance.

15:30.809 --> 15:32.909
We need to get his blood type.
We'll need a lot of units.

15:32.911 --> 15:34.410
We have to stabilize him
before we can transfer.

15:34.412 --> 15:35.512
He have
a medical bracelet on?

15:35.514 --> 15:36.679
I didn't see anything, no.

15:36.681 --> 15:38.817
I'm not gonna
let you die, Victor. Shit.

15:39.584 --> 15:41.384
Type O-positive.
Pulling four units.

15:41.386 --> 15:44.155
Great. Lie back, okay?
Just lie back. Lie back.

15:44.157 --> 15:45.623
Let's hurry up
with those units, okay?

15:45.625 --> 15:47.390
Kelly, we're gonna need to
fit him with a cervical collar

15:47.392 --> 15:48.558
to get him lifted.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.927
His brain. I can see it.

15:50.929 --> 15:52.063
Kelly. Kelly, go!

15:52.931 --> 15:54.098
Victor, please.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.468
Where are we with those units?
He's losing a lot of blood!

15:59.839 --> 16:02.139
No. No, no, no, Victor. No.
You stay with me, Victor.

16:02.141 --> 16:05.209
You stay with me. I'm right here, Victor.
Stay right here...

16:11.716 --> 16:13.918
Come...
Come back to me, Victor.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.552
Come on.
Come back to me.

16:15.554 --> 16:17.824
Come back. Come back.

16:21.393 --> 16:22.728
God damn it.

17:05.172 --> 17:07.204
Louis.

17:07.207 --> 17:10.877
The barrier is not
meant to be broken.

17:12.613 --> 17:13.814
Louis?

17:18.252 --> 17:19.786
Uh, he's gone.

18:05.133 --> 18:06.467
Hey.

18:17.544 --> 18:19.113
What happened?

18:21.649 --> 18:23.316
This poor kid
got hit by a car today

18:23.318 --> 18:24.953
right on the campus.

18:26.688 --> 18:31.526
He, uh, couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

18:34.595 --> 18:37.131
His name was Victor Pascow.

18:38.933 --> 18:42.203
I sure wasn't expecting
to see any of that up here.

18:46.841 --> 18:48.841
Why don't you come inside?

18:48.843 --> 18:51.544
I'll make you some dinner.
You can take a shower. Okay?

18:51.546 --> 18:53.015
I'm sorry.

18:56.652 --> 18:58.953
He, uh, knew my name.

18:59.487 --> 19:01.156
What?

19:02.090 --> 19:03.092
He...

19:07.196 --> 19:08.931
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

19:14.503 --> 19:18.140
Jud? It's Ellie.
I made cookies.

19:18.540 --> 19:20.576
Are you home?

20:11.727 --> 20:13.027
You in the habit
of going through

20:13.029 --> 20:14.663
other people's things?

20:16.866 --> 20:17.967
Sorry.

20:18.401 --> 20:20.401
Is that your wife?

20:20.403 --> 20:23.606
Yeah. Her name was Norma.

20:23.973 --> 20:24.974
She's pretty.

20:25.742 --> 20:26.976
What happened to her?

20:28.111 --> 20:30.847
Got sick. Passed away.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.416
Well, maybe she's
still out there.

20:34.418 --> 20:36.451
You know,
watching from heaven?

20:36.453 --> 20:38.453
You think so, Ellie?

20:38.455 --> 20:39.889
Hey, want to come
meet my cat?

20:40.924 --> 20:42.790
- His name is Church.
- Church?

20:42.792 --> 20:44.859
That's short
for Winston Churchill.

20:44.861 --> 20:46.495
He's a guy
who lived a long time ago.

20:46.497 --> 20:49.364
Oh, I know
who Winston Churchill is.

20:49.366 --> 20:50.966
Wow. You must be really old.

20:50.968 --> 20:52.968
I'm afraid so.

20:58.741 --> 21:00.243
Oh-ho!
- Very nice!

21:00.977 --> 21:01.978
Very good.

21:02.946 --> 21:05.613
- -Nice job.
Bravo, sweetheart.

21:05.615 --> 21:08.484
- Can you clap? Clap, clap.
- Well done, honey.

21:08.486 --> 21:10.085
Thanks, folks,
for having me over.

21:10.087 --> 21:12.788
It's been a long time since
I've had any good home cooking.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.457
How long have you lived here?

21:14.459 --> 21:15.924
What, in Ludlow,
or in that house?

21:15.926 --> 21:18.361
- Either.
- All my life.

21:18.363 --> 21:19.628
To both questions.

21:20.698 --> 21:22.432
- Whoa, big fella!
- Church!

21:22.434 --> 21:24.466
- He likes you.
- Well, I like him.

21:24.468 --> 21:26.101
Church good kitty.

21:26.103 --> 21:27.336
- Hey!
- Yes.

21:27.338 --> 21:29.338
- Church good, good kitty.
- He is.

21:29.340 --> 21:31.640
- Yeah.
- I was curious, Jud...

21:31.642 --> 21:33.275
Um, the realtor
said the house came

21:33.277 --> 21:35.777
with over 50 acres of woods.

21:35.779 --> 21:38.181
That pet cemetery,
do we own that, too?

21:38.183 --> 21:40.684
Well, that's
part of your property.

21:42.053 --> 21:44.621
How far back
is the property line?

21:44.623 --> 21:49.059
Well, it's further
than you'd ever care to go.

22:04.476 --> 22:07.212
<i>Louis.</i>

22:55.728 --> 22:57.461
Come on, Doc.

23:23.822 --> 23:26.092
<i>You tried to help me.</i>

23:26.826 --> 23:28.961
<i>Now let me help you.</i>

23:48.981 --> 23:53.052
<i>This is the place
where the dead rest.</i>

23:54.388 --> 23:56.721
<i>Do not go on to the place</i>

23:56.723 --> 23:59.293
<i>where the dead walk.</i>

24:15.575 --> 24:18.910
Stop! The ground is sour!

24:20.647 --> 24:22.316
Wake up, Dada!

24:23.016 --> 24:25.651
Oh, hey, buddy.

24:25.653 --> 24:27.819
Come here,
come here, come here.

24:27.821 --> 24:29.288
Come to Daddy.

24:30.957 --> 24:33.461
- I love you, Daddy.
- Hmm?

24:34.329 --> 24:35.929
Oh, man, thank you.

24:36.530 --> 24:38.165
Time for Daddy to get up.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.040
Hi.

24:48.810 --> 24:50.609
- Good morning, sleepyhead.
- Hey.

24:50.611 --> 24:52.813
Did you wake up Dada? Huh?

24:52.815 --> 24:54.847
- Did you wake up Dada, huh?
- What time is it?

24:54.849 --> 24:56.317
It's late. You slept in.

25:10.331 --> 25:12.500
- Hey, guys!
- Hi, Ellie.

25:13.534 --> 25:14.801
What have you guys got?

25:14.803 --> 25:16.369
I've got some candy
corns, lollipops...

25:16.371 --> 25:17.804
They also have
really big gummy bears.

25:17.806 --> 25:21.575
Okay, which one is the sheet
and which one is the gho... Oh!

25:21.577 --> 25:23.743
You look like a ghost, don't you, huh?

25:23.745 --> 25:24.944
You've been busy already.

25:24.946 --> 25:27.213
- You guys look great.
- Thank you.

25:27.215 --> 25:28.414
We have to go
to the Pattersons,

25:28.416 --> 25:31.183
- 'cause they have the biggest candy...
- El, uh...

25:31.185 --> 25:32.918
- Take your broom, honey?
- Yeah.

25:32.920 --> 25:34.019
Talk among yourselves.

25:34.021 --> 25:35.657
- I'll be back, okay?
- Okay.

25:40.027 --> 25:42.131
What are you doing, Jud?
You scaring the kids?

25:43.232 --> 25:45.632
There's something
you need to see.

25:48.570 --> 25:49.571
All right.

26:00.482 --> 26:03.051
Oh, no. Church.

26:07.356 --> 26:09.791
One of those
damn Orinco trucks.

26:09.793 --> 26:12.292
- Dad!
- Oh, shit.

26:12.294 --> 26:15.030
- Dad!
- Uh, we can't let Ellie see this.

26:16.265 --> 26:17.865
Come on, we got to go
trick-or-treating

26:17.867 --> 26:19.566
- with Zoe and Tyler.
- Yeah, honey.

26:19.568 --> 26:21.601
I'm just gonna say
a quick hello to Jud.

26:21.603 --> 26:23.303
- Okay?
- I'll put a spell on you.

26:23.305 --> 26:25.673
You already have, sweetheart.

26:25.675 --> 26:28.478
You go wait in the car, honey.
I'll be right there.

26:30.112 --> 26:32.113
You, uh...
You go with the kids.

26:32.115 --> 26:33.781
Come back later,
we'll take care of this.

26:37.419 --> 26:39.021
Okay.

26:39.656 --> 26:40.956
And, Louis...

26:42.892 --> 26:44.394
We should do this tonight.

26:46.763 --> 26:48.298
Sure, yeah.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.170
You're sure?

26:55.572 --> 26:57.173
Yeah, I'm sure.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.642
I mean, he was all twisted.

27:02.378 --> 27:05.113
Which brings me

27:05.981 --> 27:08.249
to the fact
that we have to tell Ellie.

27:08.251 --> 27:10.251
- No, can we just tell her...
- Rachel. No, we need...

27:10.253 --> 27:13.223
Can we just tell her
that he ran away, please?

27:15.191 --> 27:17.024
You know, honey,
I get it, okay?

27:17.026 --> 27:20.596
I get it's difficult
for you to talk about death

27:20.598 --> 27:22.430
after what you went through
with your sister,

27:22.432 --> 27:24.866
but I think it's time
you finally opened up.

27:24.868 --> 27:26.102
I'm just...

27:27.704 --> 27:29.738
No, I'm just
upset about Church.

27:29.740 --> 27:33.441
Rachel, talk to me.
We both know this is about Zelda.

27:33.443 --> 27:37.679
<i>Ever since moving here,
I can't stop thinking about her.</i>

27:37.681 --> 27:38.680
<i>She hated me</i>

27:38.682 --> 27:42.417
because my spine
wasn't twisted like hers.

27:42.419 --> 27:46.989
<i>She promised me that one day
I'd end up just like her.</i>

27:46.991 --> 27:49.492
<i>I'd never
get out of bed again.</i>

27:50.426 --> 27:53.261
<i>My parents
left me alone with her.</i>

27:53.263 --> 27:55.764
<i>I was supposed
to bring her dinner.</i>

27:55.766 --> 27:59.334
<i>And so I used the dumbwaiter,
and I knew I wasn't supposed to</i>

27:59.336 --> 28:01.138
<i>because it didn't work
all the time.</i>

28:43.582 --> 28:46.685
She died in there
because of me.

28:49.955 --> 28:52.355
I watched them
wheel her body out,

28:52.357 --> 28:55.158
but I swear
she was still in the walls.

28:56.361 --> 28:59.698
<i>And at night,
I could hear her moving,</i>

29:00.230 --> 29:01.864
<i>calling out my name.</i>

29:01.866 --> 29:04.334
<i>Rachel.</i>

29:04.336 --> 29:05.935
I didn't know who to call.

29:05.937 --> 29:08.605
But if I had just gone up to the
room and given her her food...

29:08.607 --> 29:13.176
Your parents should never have
left you alone with her. Never.

29:13.178 --> 29:14.712
That makes me a monster.

29:14.714 --> 29:16.046
No, no, no, no, no, no,

29:16.048 --> 29:17.548
that does not
make you a monster.

29:17.550 --> 29:19.049
Come on. Hey.

29:19.051 --> 29:21.687
That does not
make you a monster. Okay?

29:21.921 --> 29:23.120
Mmm?

29:24.623 --> 29:26.090
Tell you what.

29:26.092 --> 29:30.126
Jud and I are gonna take care of
Church tonight. All right? We'll...

29:30.128 --> 29:34.834
We'll just tell Ellie
that he ran away.

29:35.434 --> 29:37.503
- Okay? Yeah?
- Okay.

29:38.871 --> 29:40.740
Just anything but dead.

29:54.285 --> 29:56.154
I got a spot for you.

30:03.529 --> 30:04.563
What is it?

30:06.532 --> 30:08.835
Nothing. Let's get this
over with, huh?

30:09.503 --> 30:10.736
It's cold.

30:16.143 --> 30:18.310
<i>Jud...</i>

30:21.580 --> 30:22.479
<i>Jud...</i>

30:26.252 --> 30:28.987
Ellie really loved that cat,
didn't she?

30:28.989 --> 30:30.590
More than anything.

30:31.692 --> 30:33.125
And you love Ellie.

30:34.860 --> 30:36.595
Well, of course.

30:39.833 --> 30:41.700
So, follow me.

30:41.702 --> 30:42.769
What?

30:43.603 --> 30:47.274
- I know all the spots to step.
- Jud, wait.

30:52.345 --> 30:54.414
What's the matter
with right here?

30:55.850 --> 30:57.783
For Chrissakes.

31:04.658 --> 31:06.259
Oh, what the hell am I doing?

31:16.771 --> 31:18.473
Jud, come on, wait up.

31:24.911 --> 31:26.613
What the hell is this place?

31:49.837 --> 31:52.540
Come a long
way to bury a cat.

32:12.727 --> 32:14.295
What was that?

32:15.763 --> 32:17.031
It's just a loon.

32:19.101 --> 32:20.568
Come on.

33:01.577 --> 33:02.845
What is this place?

33:06.282 --> 33:09.451
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

33:10.919 --> 33:12.721
Bury your animal.

33:15.725 --> 33:18.759
I'd help you,
but you have to do it yourself.

33:18.761 --> 33:22.529
And use some of these rocks
to make a cairn.

33:22.531 --> 33:25.400
- Kind of like the other ones.
- Okay.

33:48.557 --> 33:50.793
What exactly are we
doing here tonight, Jud?

33:51.694 --> 33:53.596
We're burying
your daughter's cat.

33:58.167 --> 33:59.169
And that's all?

34:00.003 --> 34:01.804
That and nothing but.

34:17.388 --> 34:18.888
You did good, Louis.

34:21.058 --> 34:22.659
I knew you would.

34:35.972 --> 34:37.572
What time is it?

34:37.908 --> 34:39.176
It's late.

34:40.811 --> 34:43.411
Did you and Jud
take care of everything?

34:43.414 --> 34:45.114
Yeah, it's done.

34:47.251 --> 34:48.719
Thank you.

34:52.123 --> 34:53.224
What is it?

34:56.226 --> 34:57.628
It's Church, honey.

34:59.063 --> 35:01.063
Yeah.

35:01.065 --> 35:07.303
Daddy and Jud went out last
night to look for Church, and...

35:07.305 --> 35:09.871
Well, we looked
all around and we...

35:09.873 --> 35:12.077
Well, sweetheart,
we couldn't find him.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.844
And so we think...

35:14.846 --> 35:17.447
We think Church ran away,
sweetheart.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.018
- Yeah.
- He didn't run away.

35:21.019 --> 35:22.884
Well...

35:22.886 --> 35:24.888
He was outside my window
last night.

35:25.923 --> 35:30.659
Honey, maybe you had a dream
that you saw him.

35:30.661 --> 35:34.065
It's okay to be
confused about all this...

35:39.771 --> 35:42.640
You just have to accept
that he might not come home.

35:43.376 --> 35:44.441
I'm sorry, sweetie.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.277
He came back last night.

35:47.178 --> 35:48.179
Look.

35:48.947 --> 35:50.547
He's right there.

36:10.769 --> 36:12.237
I thought you said
he was dead.

36:12.570 --> 36:14.005
He was.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.640
He, uh...

36:17.276 --> 36:20.246
He must've been unconscious,
in shock or something.

36:23.748 --> 36:25.951
Good thing
you're not a fucking vet.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.059
Jud.

36:37.129 --> 36:38.130
We, uh...

36:38.931 --> 36:40.732
We need to have
a little talk.

36:44.270 --> 36:47.039
Ellie's cat is walking around
over there like nothing happened.

36:48.408 --> 36:50.241
Well, I'll be damned.

36:50.243 --> 36:52.310
What the fuck does that mean?

36:52.312 --> 36:54.546
Well, isn't that
what you wanted?

36:54.548 --> 36:56.183
Save your daughter
from the truth?

36:57.551 --> 36:58.916
I mean, come on.
You saw as well as I did.

36:58.918 --> 37:01.253
- That cat was dead, Jud.
- I never said he wasn't.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.990
- Well, then how do you explain it?
- I don't.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.659
Nobody can.

37:08.661 --> 37:10.029
You're gonna have to do
better than that, Jud.

37:11.431 --> 37:13.599
There are places in this world

37:15.769 --> 37:17.869
that are older
than either of us.

37:17.871 --> 37:20.738
<i>Places that a rational
doctor brain like yours</i>

37:20.740 --> 37:22.639
<i>will never understand.</i>

37:22.641 --> 37:24.608
<i>Nobody knows
what that place is,</i>

37:24.610 --> 37:27.312
<i>what happens
in that stony ground.</i>

37:27.314 --> 37:31.318
<i>But the soil of a man's heart
is stonier, Louis.</i>

37:35.755 --> 37:37.090
<i>What we did last night,</i>

37:38.258 --> 37:39.926
<i>we did for Ellie.</i>

37:41.529 --> 37:43.730
<i>But that's your cat now.</i>

37:52.472 --> 37:55.108
"Bull presumed
dead found on main street."

37:59.347 --> 38:01.247
"Timothy Baterman..."

38:01.249 --> 38:03.317
"Cadaver disappearance?"

38:13.260 --> 38:14.928
What the fuck?

38:35.416 --> 38:37.751
Where did you take me, Jud?

38:48.796 --> 38:51.364
Church, you're so stinky.

38:51.366 --> 38:53.135
What'd you do out there?

38:56.672 --> 38:58.738
Hang on, Church,
there's something...

38:59.440 --> 39:02.143
Something gross in your fur.

39:10.751 --> 39:12.787
All right, there we go.

39:13.322 --> 39:14.820
Give me a look.

39:14.822 --> 39:16.792
Okay. Does that feel okay?

39:17.659 --> 39:19.259
Yeah?

39:19.261 --> 39:21.697
I want to go back
to our old house.

39:23.064 --> 39:27.267
Well, Mommy and I,
we moved up here to slow down,

39:27.269 --> 39:31.304
so that we could spend more
time with you, so that...

39:31.306 --> 39:32.973
Lift up.

39:32.975 --> 39:36.810
So that Daddy could be around,
he'd get to tuck you into bed more,

39:36.812 --> 39:39.279
make sure you're
all safe and sound.

39:39.281 --> 39:41.815
Give you a little tickle before he says good night.

39:41.817 --> 39:43.451
Okay? Come on.

39:43.453 --> 39:45.353
Okay, honey.

39:45.355 --> 39:48.321
I promise, okay, just like your
arm, it's gonna get better.

39:48.323 --> 39:49.925
All right? Trust me?

39:50.459 --> 39:51.758
Good night.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.393
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

39:53.395 --> 39:57.899
Close the door all the way.
I don't want Church coming in anymore.

39:59.001 --> 40:00.102
Okay.

40:01.437 --> 40:02.904
I love you.

40:06.709 --> 40:08.075
<i>How is she?</i>

40:08.077 --> 40:11.413
She's good.
Poor little thing.

40:14.517 --> 40:16.118
What about Church?

40:18.954 --> 40:21.090
I don't know.
Must've been the accident.

40:22.191 --> 40:24.927
I'll take him
to the vet tomorrow.

40:26.863 --> 40:28.298
What about you?

40:31.234 --> 40:32.469
I'm good.

40:34.870 --> 40:36.172
But...

40:38.341 --> 40:39.542
Come here.

40:43.680 --> 40:46.516
It's been hard,
the past few months.

41:17.114 --> 41:20.616
What? Oh, Jesus!

41:21.785 --> 41:22.985
Louis, it's still alive.

41:26.557 --> 41:27.622
Damn it!

41:29.827 --> 41:31.593
Jesus Christ.

41:34.631 --> 41:35.966
Church?

41:37.736 --> 41:39.136
Church?

41:42.807 --> 41:43.972
Come out of there, buddy.

41:49.813 --> 41:51.014
Church...

42:21.011 --> 42:22.779
<i>Your destruction</i>

42:22.781 --> 42:28.486
<i>and the destruction of all
you love is very near, Doctor.</i>

44:37.017 --> 44:38.883
Rach, what happened?
You okay?

44:38.885 --> 44:40.086
Mmm.

44:41.821 --> 44:43.256
I don't want
to talk about it.

44:46.126 --> 44:48.529
- Is it the bird?
- No, it's not the bird.

44:50.163 --> 44:53.133
I think it's a mistake
that we moved here.

44:55.135 --> 44:57.337
It doesn't feel right, Louis.

45:02.442 --> 45:04.409
You remember why we moved here
in the first place?

45:04.411 --> 45:05.613
No, I know.

45:08.148 --> 45:12.253
I mean, look, we have
Ellie's birthday coming up.

45:13.287 --> 45:14.620
Why don't we do something
special, hey?

45:14.622 --> 45:15.888
We could throw a party.

45:15.890 --> 45:21.228
We could invite some of our
friends from Boston up, all right?

45:24.230 --> 45:26.031
Invite your parents, even.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.469
- Okay?
- Mmm.

45:31.305 --> 45:33.073
We can turn this around.
We can.

45:33.075 --> 45:35.107
We can turn this around.

45:46.654 --> 45:48.656
Ooh,
these are looking good, El.

45:59.935 --> 46:01.135
El, what is this?

46:04.406 --> 46:07.275
I don't know.
Gage drew that.

46:15.584 --> 46:16.585
Gage?

46:24.626 --> 46:26.826
Come on, Daddy's got you.
Daddy's got you.

46:29.665 --> 46:31.899
I was 11
when I lost Biff.

46:31.901 --> 46:37.070
He'd run over some barbed wire
and the cuts got infected.

46:37.072 --> 46:39.775
Daddy had to put him down
out of mercy.

46:42.577 --> 46:45.679
- Your dad took you up there.
- No, no.

46:45.681 --> 46:49.016
It was an old fella
named Stanny Bouchard.

46:49.018 --> 46:50.486
He told me about it.

46:54.257 --> 46:56.259
The Wendigo.

46:57.325 --> 46:58.825
You heard a lot about that

46:58.827 --> 47:01.596
all over the north country
back in the old days.

47:02.165 --> 47:04.197
It was a myth

47:04.199 --> 47:08.334
passed down from the local
tribes up this way.

47:08.336 --> 47:11.605
But to them, it wasn't
just some campfire story.

47:11.607 --> 47:13.943
They believed it.
They feared it.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.845
Saw these
on the trees up there.

47:17.847 --> 47:19.747
Yeah, they're warnings.

47:19.749 --> 47:22.584
The local tribes carved them
before they fled.

47:22.919 --> 47:23.784
Fled?

47:23.786 --> 47:26.687
Yeah, they knew
the power of that place.

47:26.689 --> 47:30.124
They felt its pull.

47:30.126 --> 47:35.796
They came to believe that
those woods belonged to something else.

47:35.798 --> 47:38.601
That the ground was bad.

47:40.571 --> 47:41.705
Sour.

47:42.405 --> 47:44.273
The ground is sour.

47:45.641 --> 47:47.241
Yeah.

47:47.243 --> 47:50.947
So, they moved on.
But not before they built that deadfall.

47:52.415 --> 47:54.348
They built it
to keep people out.

47:54.350 --> 47:55.886
But it didn't keep people out.

47:57.253 --> 47:59.054
The Wendigo

47:59.056 --> 48:02.758
may just be
some crazy folktale,

48:02.760 --> 48:04.828
but there is
something up there.

48:06.997 --> 48:08.799
Something
that brings things back.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.003
So, what happened
to your dog, Jud?

48:13.937 --> 48:16.505
He came back.

48:16.507 --> 48:21.143
Just like Stanny B. said he would.
But he was changed.

48:21.145 --> 48:24.815
It was when he went after my
mother that my daddy put him down.

48:25.816 --> 48:27.384
For the second time.

48:31.823 --> 48:36.290
I thought it would be
different with Ellie's cat.

48:36.292 --> 48:40.295
I mean, Biff had a mean
streak to begin with.

48:40.297 --> 48:43.298
But Church, well...

48:43.300 --> 48:45.602
- Was a nice cat...
- He tried to hurt Gage.

48:47.437 --> 48:49.841
I'm so sorry, Louis. I am.

48:52.243 --> 48:55.578
Once you feel the power
of that place,

48:55.580 --> 48:59.083
you make up the sweetest-smelling
reasons to go back.

49:00.952 --> 49:02.786
But I was wrong.

49:04.621 --> 49:06.958
Sometimes dead is better.

49:12.964 --> 49:14.365
Come on, hold still.

49:15.800 --> 49:17.533
Hold still, you're just
gonna go to sleep.

49:17.535 --> 49:20.072
- -Damn it, Church.
Come on, just...

49:24.242 --> 49:26.778
God damn it.

49:41.694 --> 49:42.728
Come on.

49:43.562 --> 49:44.428
Hey.

49:49.033 --> 49:50.366
Good luck.

50:13.391 --> 50:18.095
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

50:18.097 --> 50:21.665
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

50:21.667 --> 50:27.138
<i>♪ Happy birthday,
dear Ellie ♪</i>

50:27.140 --> 50:30.607
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

50:35.814 --> 50:36.914
Good job, Ellie.

50:36.916 --> 50:39.549
I want a piece
right from the end.

50:41.921 --> 50:43.555
...big St. Bernard.

50:44.423 --> 50:46.893
He got rabies.
He killed about four people.

50:53.633 --> 50:54.734
Hey.

50:59.105 --> 51:01.107
You still thinking
about Church?

51:02.042 --> 51:04.541
It's my fault he left.

51:04.543 --> 51:06.510
I told him
to get out of my room.

51:06.512 --> 51:08.445
No, honey, no.

51:08.447 --> 51:09.950
Church loves you.

51:10.884 --> 51:14.821
Maybe this might
help cheer you up.

51:20.428 --> 51:21.893
Give him a squeeze.

51:21.895 --> 51:22.961
Hmm?

51:23.897 --> 51:27.131
- I love him, Daddy.
- You do? Yeah?

51:27.133 --> 51:28.400
And I love you.

51:28.402 --> 51:31.972
Now go and have
a great birthday, okay?

51:33.140 --> 51:34.839
<i>Six...</i>

51:34.841 --> 51:40.846
Seven, eight, nine, 10!

51:43.751 --> 51:45.785
I'm a monster!

51:46.920 --> 51:50.322
Where is everyone?
Where are you guys? Come on.

51:55.796 --> 51:58.766
Come on! Where is that...
Come on! Come on!

52:12.279 --> 52:13.680
Church?

52:15.316 --> 52:16.717
Church!

52:23.225 --> 52:26.094
Church. You came home.

52:37.271 --> 52:38.639
All right, you're it.

52:42.110 --> 52:43.677
Where's...

52:44.513 --> 52:45.914
Gage!

52:54.390 --> 52:55.590
Church!

56:15.927 --> 56:18.194
I keep thinking

56:18.196 --> 56:22.532
that I'm gonna hear her
coming up the stairs,

56:22.534 --> 56:25.337
like she's coming home
from school.

56:33.945 --> 56:36.247
I can't be here right now.

56:44.356 --> 56:46.891
I'm just gonna
wrap up a few things.

56:47.359 --> 56:49.293
Come soon.

56:49.295 --> 56:51.864
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

56:55.234 --> 56:58.034
Be a good boy, okay, buddy?
Take care of Mommy for me.

56:58.036 --> 56:59.505
I'll see you in a couple days.

57:57.997 --> 58:01.334
I saw Rachel and Gage
leaving a little while ago.

58:02.536 --> 58:03.769
Boston.

58:05.473 --> 58:07.073
Parents' house.

58:11.544 --> 58:13.413
So it's just you over there?

58:15.281 --> 58:16.749
Yep.

58:16.751 --> 58:18.116
I'll drive down
in a few days.

58:18.118 --> 58:21.154
I got to finish a few things
at the clinic first.

58:23.657 --> 58:25.290
That's good.

58:25.292 --> 58:28.229
It's a tough time
for you folks to be apart.

58:29.797 --> 58:31.165
Yeah.

58:55.891 --> 59:01.162
You know, when you came walking over
here, it was a relief.

59:02.196 --> 59:04.565
I was gonna come to see you.

59:07.535 --> 59:10.605
I should never have
shown you that place.

59:12.674 --> 59:14.141
But you did.

59:15.644 --> 59:18.478
I know what you're
thinking of doing, Louis...

59:18.480 --> 59:22.848
...but she
won't come back the same.

59:22.850 --> 59:26.985
I'm so goddamn sorry
I did this.

59:26.987 --> 59:31.925
Ellie is the first person to
touch my heart in a long time.

59:31.927 --> 59:35.261
I didn't want her
to be so sad.

59:35.263 --> 59:38.965
It's that goddamn place.
It feeds on your grief,

59:38.967 --> 59:41.369
gets into your mind.

59:43.071 --> 59:44.272
Damn it.

59:46.474 --> 59:50.077
I need to
close my eyes for a minute.

01:00:09.331 --> 01:00:10.398
<i>Hey.</i>

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:12.565
<i>Thought you'd be in bed.</i>

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:16.438
I was waiting to hear from you.
I called earlier.

01:00:17.606 --> 01:00:19.673
<i>Yeah, I know, I saw that.
I was, uh...</i>

01:00:19.675 --> 01:00:23.479
I went over to Jud's.
Had a couple of drinks.

01:00:24.981 --> 01:00:28.083
<i>Can you just
come be with us?</i>

01:00:31.187 --> 01:00:33.755
Gage needs you and I'm...

01:00:39.027 --> 01:00:41.397
I'm really wiped out, honey.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.268
Is it okay
if we talk tomorrow?

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:48.404
Okay.

01:00:49.739 --> 01:00:51.539
I love you.

01:00:51.541 --> 01:00:53.276
I love you, too.

01:00:53.744 --> 01:00:55.044
Goodbye.

01:01:18.936 --> 01:01:20.336
Fuck.

01:03:12.450 --> 01:03:14.918
<i>Louis, stop.</i>

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.588
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

01:03:17.856 --> 01:03:20.090
<i>You have to let her go.</i>

01:03:20.092 --> 01:03:21.659
But I can fix this.

01:03:22.995 --> 01:03:24.326
<i>Pascow!</i>

01:03:24.328 --> 01:03:27.465
Pascow! Pascow!

01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:31.935
Come here. No, it's okay.

01:03:31.937 --> 01:03:34.339
It's okay. It's okay.

01:03:36.141 --> 01:03:37.874
<i>Go home.</i>

01:03:37.876 --> 01:03:40.144
Pascow says go home.

01:03:40.146 --> 01:03:42.247
Mommy, go home!

01:03:43.917 --> 01:03:45.716
There's nothing there.

01:03:56.261 --> 01:03:57.930
There's nothing there.

01:04:15.748 --> 01:04:18.816
Daddy's almost there,
almost there.

01:05:22.249 --> 01:05:23.917
I'm sorry.

01:09:47.318 --> 01:09:49.153
Daddy?

01:09:50.688 --> 01:09:52.220
Where am I?

01:09:54.292 --> 01:09:56.761
Oh, my... My little girl.

01:09:59.064 --> 01:10:00.397
Come here.

01:10:00.399 --> 01:10:01.965
Oh, you're home!

01:10:06.138 --> 01:10:07.606
Home.

01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:07.666
What is it?

01:11:08.368 --> 01:11:09.969
Just a tangle.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:26.419
Where's Mommy and Gage?

01:11:28.188 --> 01:11:30.924
They went down
to Grandma and Grandpa's.

01:11:31.658 --> 01:11:33.960
Are they coming back?

01:11:37.197 --> 01:11:38.198
Yeah.

01:11:41.968 --> 01:11:44.836
I remember my birthday party.

01:11:46.772 --> 01:11:48.741
Church was out on the road.

01:11:51.511 --> 01:11:54.047
I was so happy he came home.

01:11:57.884 --> 01:11:59.819
There was a truck.

01:12:00.787 --> 01:12:02.722
Then everything went black.

01:12:03.657 --> 01:12:05.326
Well, it's okay now.

01:12:07.194 --> 01:12:08.728
Now you're back.

01:12:11.599 --> 01:12:13.199
Back from where?

01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:24.343
It's time to go to bed, okay?
Turn the light off.

01:12:24.345 --> 01:12:26.914
I'm dead, aren't I?

01:12:27.414 --> 01:12:29.351
No, honey. No.

01:12:31.151 --> 01:12:32.419
You're here.

01:12:34.754 --> 01:12:36.756
Will you stay with me?

01:12:38.292 --> 01:12:39.426
Of course.

01:12:54.876 --> 01:12:57.111
I can hear the woods.

01:12:59.313 --> 01:13:01.915
The windows are
closed, sweetheart.

01:13:02.383 --> 01:13:04.051
Not like that.

01:13:06.321 --> 01:13:08.089
Inside.

01:13:14.996 --> 01:13:17.330
Does Mommy know about me?

01:13:17.332 --> 01:13:18.933
Please, El...

01:13:20.402 --> 01:13:22.870
Close your eyes, okay?

01:13:23.804 --> 01:13:25.873
It's gonna be okay.

01:13:33.815 --> 01:13:35.551
Love you, Daddy.

01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:39.422
Love you too, El.

01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.887
El?

01:14:47.657 --> 01:14:49.125
Ellie, careful.

01:14:52.262 --> 01:14:55.265
Just stop it. Stop it.
Stop. Ellie, stop it.

01:14:56.198 --> 01:14:57.633
Stop it!

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:09.212
Why'd you put
the dress back on?

01:15:19.089 --> 01:15:20.921
What are you gonna tell her?

01:15:28.965 --> 01:15:31.366
Something happened
last night. I...

01:15:31.368 --> 01:15:33.769
Gage was having a nightmare,
or I thought it was a nightmare,

01:15:33.771 --> 01:15:36.539
and he just started saying
that boy's name who died.

01:15:36.541 --> 01:15:38.973
I'm freaking out,
and Gage is freaking out,

01:15:38.975 --> 01:15:40.543
and I... I just need
to talk to you.

01:15:40.545 --> 01:15:43.245
Just please call me back.

01:15:43.247 --> 01:15:44.612
<i>It's 4:00 p.m. on the dot</i>

01:15:44.614 --> 01:15:46.916
<i>and we're coming
to you with a traffic update.</i>

01:15:46.918 --> 01:15:48.216
<i>Expect major delays.</i>

01:15:48.218 --> 01:15:50.151
<i>Traffic on the I-95
is backed-up for miles.</i>

01:15:50.153 --> 01:15:52.487
We're gonna be okay, okay?

01:15:52.489 --> 01:15:54.122
- Okay?
- Mama.

01:15:54.124 --> 01:15:56.492
- Mama.
- <i>Call Jud.</i>

01:15:56.494 --> 01:16:01.497
<i>So far, no fatalities,
but two passengers have been airlifted...</i>

01:16:01.499 --> 01:16:03.766
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Jud, hi, it's Rachel.

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:06.001
Rachel. You...

01:16:06.003 --> 01:16:08.570
You down at your folks' place?

01:16:08.572 --> 01:16:10.472
<i>Yeah, I'm on my way back.
Something's wrong.</i>

01:16:10.474 --> 01:16:12.273
<i>I'm really worried about
Louis right now.</i>

01:16:12.275 --> 01:16:14.142
- Louis?
- Can you just go over there

01:16:14.144 --> 01:16:15.845
and check on him, please?

01:16:15.847 --> 01:16:18.481
<i>I just... I've been calling him
all morning, and I don't know...</i>

01:16:18.483 --> 01:16:22.485
What...
He... He's not answering?

01:16:22.487 --> 01:16:25.755
No. And I've called him
so many times.

01:16:25.757 --> 01:16:29.759
- <i>Well, I'll go on over there and check.</i>
- Okay. Thank you, Jud.

01:16:29.761 --> 01:16:31.328
<i>I should be there soon, okay?</i>

01:16:31.330 --> 01:16:34.196
Yeah,
I'll see you then, Rachel.

01:16:43.174 --> 01:16:46.143
Louis? You in there?

01:16:50.349 --> 01:16:51.483
Hey, Jud.

01:16:53.017 --> 01:16:54.684
How's your head today?

01:16:54.686 --> 01:16:56.452
Oh.

01:16:56.454 --> 01:16:58.389
It's banging
like a drum, Jud.

01:17:07.232 --> 01:17:09.633
I don't remember
you leaving last night.

01:17:09.635 --> 01:17:11.236
Yeah, you passed out.

01:17:14.039 --> 01:17:15.472
Listen,
I got to, uh...

01:17:15.474 --> 01:17:17.276
I got to get
back inside. I'm...

01:17:18.711 --> 01:17:21.011
I've been waiting for Rachel
to call all morning

01:17:21.013 --> 01:17:23.382
and I don't want
to miss it. So...

01:17:24.850 --> 01:17:26.050
Okay?

01:17:29.855 --> 01:17:32.124
If you've done
something, Louis,

01:17:33.325 --> 01:17:35.327
it's not too late
to undo it.

01:17:42.100 --> 01:17:44.169
You don't have to worry
about me, Jud.

01:17:44.803 --> 01:17:46.138
I'm fine.

01:17:47.806 --> 01:17:49.072
Really.

01:17:49.074 --> 01:17:50.743
If that's all, I'm gonna...

01:17:51.711 --> 01:17:53.178
I'm gonna go.

01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:41.923
I know you're up here!

01:21:25.661 --> 01:21:27.995
- Hello, Jud.
- Stop it, Ellie.

01:21:27.997 --> 01:21:30.066
Now, just slow down.

01:21:31.333 --> 01:21:33.467
Your sweet Norma.

01:21:33.469 --> 01:21:36.403
She's burning down in hell
for what you did to her.

01:21:36.405 --> 01:21:38.940
I saw her there, Jud.
I saw her.

01:21:38.942 --> 01:21:41.578
Shut up! You don't know
anything about her!

01:21:44.980 --> 01:21:46.914
Did you miss me, Judson?

01:21:46.916 --> 01:21:48.950
That's not my Norma!

01:21:51.188 --> 01:21:55.123
Ellie's hurting.
You did this to her!

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:57.258
It's not you.
It's not you!

01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:00.094
You told Louis
about that place.

01:22:00.096 --> 01:22:02.030
And now we're suffering

01:22:02.032 --> 01:22:03.900
eternally.

01:22:07.469 --> 01:22:11.371
But we're here now
to bring you back

01:22:11.373 --> 01:22:14.075
so you can suffer with us.

01:22:14.077 --> 01:22:16.780
Just you come
and fucking try!

01:22:24.989 --> 01:22:26.123
El?

01:22:36.300 --> 01:22:37.667
Oh, shit.

01:22:41.371 --> 01:22:43.138
Rachel.

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.672
What are you...

01:22:44.674 --> 01:22:46.775
You're okay.
Thank God you're okay!

01:22:46.777 --> 01:22:49.078
I was so worried,
and I was calling

01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.279
and you wouldn't
pick up, and

01:22:50.281 --> 01:22:51.580
Gage was having
these nightmares

01:22:51.582 --> 01:22:55.049
and he was saying the name
of that boy that died.

01:22:55.051 --> 01:22:58.153
I'm here right now.
I just need you and no one else.

01:22:58.155 --> 01:22:59.420
Just you, me and Gage,

01:22:59.422 --> 01:23:01.656
- we can get through this.
- It's okay. It's okay.

01:23:01.658 --> 01:23:03.325
Come on, honey, it's okay.

01:23:03.327 --> 01:23:04.593
Oh. Oh.

01:23:04.595 --> 01:23:06.695
- Look at you, hey? You're Daddy's boy.
- Daddy.

01:23:06.697 --> 01:23:08.664
Have you gotten bigger?
Hey? Tell me, come on.

01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:10.666
Have you gotten bigger?
I think he has. I think he has.

01:23:10.668 --> 01:23:12.568
I think he's gotten
a lot bigger.

01:23:12.570 --> 01:23:14.503
Oh, you smell so good! Hmm.

01:23:14.505 --> 01:23:17.040
Oh, you smell so good!
Come to Daddy.

01:23:17.042 --> 01:23:20.845
Louis, what's going on?

01:23:25.049 --> 01:23:27.418
I needed more time with her.

01:23:28.052 --> 01:23:30.588
Come here. Come here.

01:23:31.923 --> 01:23:33.025
Honey.

01:23:34.592 --> 01:23:36.762
I wasn't ready
to say goodbye to her.

01:23:37.296 --> 01:23:39.596
You're scaring me.

01:23:39.598 --> 01:23:41.731
Just tell me
what you're talking about.

01:23:41.733 --> 01:23:43.532
It was my fault
she died, Rach.

01:23:43.534 --> 01:23:45.469
I had to bring her back.

01:23:49.975 --> 01:23:51.308
Ellie-phant.

01:24:00.686 --> 01:24:02.788
The Great and Terrible.

01:24:06.359 --> 01:24:09.227
There's a place, Rach,
deep in the woods

01:24:10.262 --> 01:24:12.563
beyond the pet cemetery.

01:24:17.202 --> 01:24:18.971
It brings things back.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:23.840
Aren't you happy, Mommy?

01:24:36.588 --> 01:24:38.124
Hug your daughter, Rach.

01:24:39.425 --> 01:24:41.027
Hug your daughter.

01:24:50.103 --> 01:24:52.605
I need to put Gage to bed.

01:24:54.507 --> 01:24:56.008
Rachel!

01:24:57.076 --> 01:24:58.309
She doesn't want me here.

01:24:59.479 --> 01:25:02.079
No, no, no, no, no.
Mommy just needs time.

01:25:02.081 --> 01:25:06.083
It's okay.
I don't want her here, either.

01:25:06.085 --> 01:25:08.420
We're okay. Okay, yes.

01:25:08.422 --> 01:25:10.422
Here you go.
Here you go, sweetie.

01:25:10.424 --> 01:25:12.023
Rachel.

01:25:12.025 --> 01:25:13.960
Rachel, open up. Please.

01:25:14.527 --> 01:25:16.130
Just let me explain.

01:25:17.398 --> 01:25:19.866
I know. Let me explain.

01:25:24.971 --> 01:25:27.605
What is she? What is...

01:25:27.607 --> 01:25:29.073
That is Ellie out there.

01:25:29.075 --> 01:25:32.743
No. No, we buried her.
We put her in the ground.

01:25:32.745 --> 01:25:36.448
She's been given back to us.
We have a second chance.

01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:38.483
It doesn't work
that way, Louis.

01:25:38.485 --> 01:25:39.985
Yes, it does.
There's a place in the woods.

01:25:39.987 --> 01:25:41.353
That place
I was telling you about.

01:25:41.355 --> 01:25:43.754
I couldn't understand it until
I buried Church up there.

01:25:43.756 --> 01:25:46.057
That cat was dead until I
buried him in the ground

01:25:46.059 --> 01:25:47.560
and it brought him back.

01:25:48.961 --> 01:25:51.597
He wasn't the same
after that.

01:25:52.433 --> 01:25:54.399
You saw her.

01:25:54.401 --> 01:25:56.435
You touched her.
That is our daughter.

01:25:56.437 --> 01:25:57.936
You dug her up?

01:25:57.938 --> 01:25:59.971
That is our daughter
down there, honey.

01:25:59.973 --> 01:26:01.575
Please, okay?

01:26:03.278 --> 01:26:04.743
I did what I think
was right.

01:26:04.745 --> 01:26:07.747
Let God take
his own fucking kid!

01:26:20.828 --> 01:26:22.830
- Ellie?
- You're okay.

01:26:23.864 --> 01:26:24.931
Ellie!

01:26:24.933 --> 01:26:28.369
Ellie, baby, Mommy and Daddy
were just...

01:26:31.338 --> 01:26:32.606
Shit.

01:26:43.585 --> 01:26:45.351
Mama.

01:26:45.353 --> 01:26:47.854
It's okay, sweetie.
It's okay.

01:26:47.856 --> 01:26:50.123
Mommy's okay. Mommy's...

01:26:57.432 --> 01:27:00.801
No. No, no, no.
No, no, no...

01:27:02.504 --> 01:27:03.705
No.

01:28:09.972 --> 01:28:11.073
Rachel.

01:28:15.911 --> 01:28:19.416
Now you'll never
get out of bed again.

01:28:32.596 --> 01:28:34.562
No! No!

01:28:34.564 --> 01:28:37.398
Stop struggling,
you useless cow.

01:28:38.501 --> 01:28:39.768
Ellie?

01:28:46.443 --> 01:28:47.477
Shit.

01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:17.375
Jud!

01:29:24.682 --> 01:29:26.314
Oh, my God.

01:29:26.316 --> 01:29:29.119
Oh, my God. No, Jud.

01:29:34.791 --> 01:29:36.827
God damn it!

01:30:07.625 --> 01:30:09.425
Louis! Take the baby!

01:30:09.427 --> 01:30:11.293
- Louis!
- Rachel!

01:30:11.295 --> 01:30:13.262
Take the baby!
Ellie's trying to kill me!

01:30:13.264 --> 01:30:14.830
- Come on, I got him. Jump!
- Take the baby!

01:30:14.832 --> 01:30:17.634
Let him go! Come on,
Daddy's got you.

01:30:17.636 --> 01:30:18.969
Come on.

01:30:25.644 --> 01:30:27.744
Okay. Okay, Gage.

01:30:27.746 --> 01:30:29.612
Daddy needs you
to stay in the car, okay?

01:30:29.614 --> 01:30:30.946
Don't open the door
for anyone.

01:30:30.948 --> 01:30:32.682
Listen to me, Gage,
not even for Ellie.

01:30:36.455 --> 01:30:40.089
You let me die in that road.
You did nothing.

01:30:40.091 --> 01:30:42.327
Just like you did
with your sister.

01:30:43.795 --> 01:30:45.364
I was scared.

01:30:56.308 --> 01:30:58.341
You're a liar.

01:30:58.343 --> 01:31:00.612
You prayed
your sister would die.

01:31:01.546 --> 01:31:02.981
I did.

01:31:04.683 --> 01:31:08.652
Remember when Daddy said
there was nothing after this?

01:31:08.654 --> 01:31:10.322
Well, he was wrong.

01:31:11.890 --> 01:31:13.990
But it's not heaven.

01:31:13.992 --> 01:31:16.928
And you're going there soon,
Mommy.

01:31:18.864 --> 01:31:21.133
Don't call me "Mommy."

01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:26.972
You're not my daughter.

01:31:29.876 --> 01:31:31.377
Ellie's dead.

01:31:32.512 --> 01:31:34.345
Then go be with her!

01:31:36.582 --> 01:31:38.117
Rachel!

01:31:42.288 --> 01:31:45.489
Oh, God, Rach.
I got Gage.

01:31:45.491 --> 01:31:48.325
Don't bury me in that place.

01:31:48.327 --> 01:31:49.328
What?

01:32:44.618 --> 01:32:46.520
Oh, fuck. Shit.

01:33:02.302 --> 01:33:03.604
Rachel!

01:33:05.572 --> 01:33:07.441
You're too late.

01:33:10.645 --> 01:33:12.378
Where's Mommy?

01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:15.550
Mommy's already
feasting on dirt.

01:33:16.384 --> 01:33:19.319
What have you done, El?
Come on.

01:33:21.188 --> 01:33:23.490
You started this, Daddy.

01:33:25.526 --> 01:33:27.529
When you moved us here.

01:33:29.831 --> 01:33:32.030
When you buried Church.

01:33:32.032 --> 01:33:34.032
When you buried me!

01:33:51.619 --> 01:33:53.319
Stop fighting, Daddy.

01:33:53.321 --> 01:33:55.256
It will be better this way.

01:34:16.578 --> 01:34:19.615
You're dead!
You're dead!

01:34:28.190 --> 01:34:30.458
You're dead!

01:34:32.193 --> 01:34:34.195
Please,
please, just stop.

01:34:40.035 --> 01:34:41.902
Get off!

01:34:41.904 --> 01:34:43.370
I thought we could
be a family.

01:34:43.372 --> 01:34:45.138
I wanted to be a family.

01:34:45.140 --> 01:34:46.707
But we can't.

01:34:46.709 --> 01:34:49.345
But we can, Daddy. We can.
