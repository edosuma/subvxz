WEBVTT

03:22.057 --> 03:23.891
- Good morning.
- 'Morning.

03:25.594 --> 03:28.195
<i>Can you spell parakeet?</i>

03:28.197 --> 03:29.228
Parakeet.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.229
<i>"B," "B,"</i>

03:30.297 --> 03:31.197
<i>"I," "I,"</i>

03:31.265 --> 03:32.365
<i>"R," "R,"</i>

03:32.367 --> 03:33.533
<i>"D." "D."</i>

03:33.601 --> 03:34.701
<i>Wrong. Try again.</i>

03:34.769 --> 03:35.902
Wrong!

03:35.969 --> 03:38.103
Wrong, aunt Trish.
Try again.

03:38.171 --> 03:39.404
What's for breakfast?

03:39.472 --> 03:40.473
My turn, huh?

03:40.540 --> 03:42.057
Mmm-hmm.

03:42.125 --> 03:44.293
Darling, Donna has locked
herself in our bathroom.

03:44.360 --> 03:45.460
Would you get her

03:45.527 --> 03:47.027
the hell out of there, please?

03:47.096 --> 03:49.029
My favorite role,
the wicked stepmother.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.531
Absolutely.

03:50.599 --> 03:52.433
It's chilly in here
this morning, huh?

03:52.501 --> 03:53.733
Yeah.
I'll check that.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.901
You making breakfast?

03:54.969 --> 03:57.537
Aunt Trish said it's my turn.

03:57.605 --> 03:59.723
Shh, with that
"aunt Trish" stuff.

03:59.725 --> 04:01.924
I have been begging you
since you got here

04:01.991 --> 04:03.392
not to call her that.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.860
It's been a month already.

04:04.928 --> 04:07.229
Bruce, old habits
die hard, you know.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.481
Right, they do.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.650
My mom always calls her Trish.

04:11.717 --> 04:14.018
My grandma always
called her Trish.

04:14.086 --> 04:16.004
But aunt Pat hates it.

04:16.072 --> 04:18.238
<i>She thinks it's declasse.</i>

04:18.673 --> 04:19.773
<i>Declasse?</i>

04:21.309 --> 04:23.010
Call her Pat, will you?

04:23.078 --> 04:24.078
I'll try.

04:24.144 --> 04:25.644
You want to help me
make breakfast?

04:25.713 --> 04:27.113
Yeah, I'd love to.
Come on.

04:27.181 --> 04:29.082
<i>What does "declasse" mean?</i>

04:30.784 --> 04:31.784
Come on.

04:31.852 --> 04:33.484
I heard mom and pop
called last night.

04:33.552 --> 04:34.636
Yeah, they did.

04:34.704 --> 04:36.855
Donna? We're go...

04:36.923 --> 04:38.257
Just a second, Pat.

04:38.324 --> 04:39.858
We're going to be late again,

04:39.925 --> 04:42.160
and you still have to use
my eyeliner,

04:42.227 --> 04:43.661
which I have.

04:47.366 --> 04:48.265
Here.

04:48.332 --> 04:49.582
Thanks.

04:49.650 --> 04:51.584
You look great.

04:51.652 --> 04:52.952
Now remember, less is more.

04:56.189 --> 04:59.992
Ok. We got eggs, sausage,
bacon, dill pickles.

05:00.059 --> 05:01.310
What will it be?

05:01.378 --> 05:02.644
Toast 'ems.

05:02.712 --> 05:04.379
Oh, no!

05:04.381 --> 05:05.396
Not again.

05:05.464 --> 05:08.032
I cook.
You set the table.

05:09.167 --> 05:10.101
Done.

05:10.168 --> 05:11.402
A masterpiece.

05:11.469 --> 05:12.836
A veritable Picasso.

05:12.903 --> 05:15.154
No! He would have
put your nose over here.

05:16.791 --> 05:18.392
Can I borrow this?

05:20.761 --> 05:22.394
You look like an eskimo.

05:22.462 --> 05:24.029
Well, I'm a California person.

05:24.097 --> 05:26.065
I'm not used to wearing
all this stuff.

05:26.133 --> 05:28.733
Listen, surfer girl, the
week before you got here,

05:28.801 --> 05:31.736
the temperature got above
zero for about 6 minutes.

05:31.804 --> 05:33.371
If it's this cold inside,

05:33.438 --> 05:37.007
you're gonna appreciate all those
things when you get outside.

05:37.074 --> 05:39.009
Doesn't it ever
get warm in Chicago?

05:39.076 --> 05:42.112
You are going to regret that
remark come August, young lady.

05:42.179 --> 05:43.212
August?

05:43.280 --> 05:46.449
I'm supposed
to go home before August.

05:46.517 --> 05:49.602
If I had my way,
I'd keep you here forever.

05:51.437 --> 05:53.038
Pat?

05:53.105 --> 05:54.456
What are you gonna wear tonight?

05:54.523 --> 05:55.374
Uh...

05:55.441 --> 05:57.092
Last year's salary.

05:57.159 --> 05:58.859
It wasn't that expensive.

05:58.927 --> 06:00.627
Ah! Oh, yeah?

06:00.629 --> 06:01.879
What are you gonna wear, dad?

06:01.881 --> 06:02.764
My tux.

06:02.831 --> 06:04.114
The one you wore
to your wedding?

06:04.182 --> 06:05.983
Yeah, the one I wore
to my wedding.

06:06.051 --> 06:07.967
Fashion's never been
your father's thing.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.785
It's a year old, dear.

06:09.853 --> 06:12.355
I think he looks handsome
in his wedding pictures.

06:12.422 --> 06:14.140
There you are.
The voice of sanity.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.157
I agree.

06:15.225 --> 06:16.759
Handsome, but conservative.

06:16.826 --> 06:17.977
I agree.

06:17.979 --> 06:20.062
Wait. Wait a minute,
you're on my side, remember?

06:20.129 --> 06:22.696
A woman's entitled
to change her mind.

06:26.718 --> 06:28.853
Ah, no, thanks.
We'll take the next one.

06:31.673 --> 06:33.206
Ok.

06:33.274 --> 06:34.791
Who's driving me to work?

06:34.793 --> 06:35.709
Me.

06:35.777 --> 06:36.894
Let's go.

06:49.055 --> 06:50.421
All aboard.

06:52.524 --> 06:54.257
Thank you, my lady.

06:55.560 --> 06:59.246
Vroom!
Fasten your seat belts.

06:59.314 --> 07:01.281
You better be careful, honey.

07:02.716 --> 07:04.650
Remember what happened
to narcissus.

07:04.718 --> 07:05.918
Nar who?

07:05.986 --> 07:07.553
Greek mythology.
He was a guy

07:07.621 --> 07:10.021
who loved looking at his
reflection so much in a pond,

07:10.089 --> 07:11.489
he fell in and drowned.

07:11.491 --> 07:13.408
Only a boy could be that clumsy.

07:13.476 --> 07:14.710
You got that right.

07:14.777 --> 07:15.994
Hey!

07:23.819 --> 07:25.285
What's wrong?

07:28.139 --> 07:31.357
Well, every new building
has its problems.

07:31.425 --> 07:33.809
Well, we'll get those problems
before they get us.

07:33.877 --> 07:35.243
Right, huh?

07:37.413 --> 07:38.647
Right?

07:38.715 --> 07:39.715
Right.

07:51.375 --> 07:52.976
Hold it, please!

08:18.216 --> 08:19.316
Bye, honey.

08:19.384 --> 08:20.816
Have a good day.

08:20.885 --> 08:22.318
Thanks for the lift.

08:22.386 --> 08:23.786
Bye, dad.

08:24.654 --> 08:26.388
'Morning, gene.
How you doing?

08:30.443 --> 08:31.476
'Morning, Bruce.

08:31.543 --> 08:32.777
'Morning.

08:36.780 --> 08:38.082
'Morning,
Mr. Gardner.

08:38.149 --> 08:40.333
'Morning, Bill.
What's with the heat, anyway?

08:40.402 --> 08:41.684
Ah, I'm checking it now.

08:41.753 --> 08:43.553
Probably a thermo on the Fritz.

08:43.621 --> 08:46.098
Well, get it fixed and have
somebody check freight elevator 15.

08:46.122 --> 08:47.557
It's got a bit of
a stutter in it.

08:47.624 --> 08:49.024
15? Sure.

08:49.092 --> 08:50.326
'Morning.

08:55.647 --> 08:56.814
Helen!

08:58.084 --> 08:59.351
Wait up!

08:59.418 --> 09:00.517
Helen!

09:02.320 --> 09:03.487
Helen!

09:05.623 --> 09:06.823
Helen!

09:06.891 --> 09:08.024
Helen!

09:08.059 --> 09:09.191
Great!

09:09.259 --> 09:12.529
I don't have to go to that
creepy school today.

09:12.596 --> 09:14.046
Oh, no.

09:14.114 --> 09:16.348
Come on, we'll cut
them off at the pass.

09:25.923 --> 09:28.192
<i>Our 50 elevators
will be carrying</i>

09:28.260 --> 09:31.428
<i>approximately
12,000 passengers a day,</i>

09:31.495 --> 09:33.329
<i>swiftly and conveniently,</i>

09:33.397 --> 09:35.231
<i>to our many shops, offices,</i>

09:35.299 --> 09:37.400
<i>condominiums, and restaurants.</i>

09:38.302 --> 09:39.534
Come on!

09:41.504 --> 09:42.537
Come on!

09:42.605 --> 09:45.640
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

09:45.708 --> 09:47.542
<i>to a glimpse of the future.</i>

09:47.544 --> 09:49.710
Well, hi!
How are you?

09:49.778 --> 09:51.012
Fine.

09:51.080 --> 09:52.380
Oh, I'm so glad.

09:52.448 --> 09:54.682
It's hotter than hell out here.

09:56.351 --> 09:57.884
There they are.

09:58.453 --> 09:59.619
Helen!

10:00.654 --> 10:01.788
Helen!

10:01.856 --> 10:03.439
Look.
There's that snot Donna

10:03.506 --> 10:05.006
and her yucky little cousin.

10:05.074 --> 10:06.575
They're late again.

10:06.643 --> 10:08.244
Cool it, Marcie.

10:13.649 --> 10:14.916
Hi, Donna.

10:14.984 --> 10:16.184
Scott.

10:18.187 --> 10:19.236
Sorry, Helen.

10:19.304 --> 10:21.171
It's ok.
Your turn on Monday.

10:21.239 --> 10:24.874
You get 2 fun-filled weeks
to pilot the enterprise.

10:24.942 --> 10:26.009
2 weeks?

10:26.077 --> 10:29.094
2 kids, 2 weeks, just like me.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.163
Come on, mom.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.630
We're going to be late.

10:31.632 --> 10:32.414
Ok.

10:32.482 --> 10:33.516
Bye.

10:48.647 --> 10:51.381
<i>In fact, we like
to think we are a city,</i>

10:51.449 --> 10:53.750
<i>a safe, efficient Metropolis</i>

10:53.817 --> 10:57.420
<i>that will take us
into the 21st century.</i>

11:02.909 --> 11:04.743
<i>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

11:05.878 --> 11:07.811
Uh-uh, uh, one minute.

11:07.879 --> 11:09.347
Good morning.

11:10.982 --> 11:12.916
Tell him I'm over here.

11:14.836 --> 11:15.735
Hi, Mary.

11:15.803 --> 11:16.736
Hi.

11:16.804 --> 11:17.704
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

11:17.772 --> 11:19.156
<i>Konnichiwa.</i>

11:21.459 --> 11:23.559
Did you forget
to pay the heating bill?

11:23.627 --> 11:25.127
It's freezing in here.

11:25.195 --> 11:26.295
I know, it's strange.

11:26.363 --> 11:28.697
It's warmer outside.

11:28.765 --> 11:30.364
Why are they moving the tods?

11:30.433 --> 11:31.833
Takamitsu doesn't want them

11:31.901 --> 11:33.785
intermingling with
his work, darling.

11:33.852 --> 11:35.803
Oh, yeah, is he going
to be responsible

11:35.871 --> 11:38.972
for $26,000 worth of
postmodern Neo-abstraction?

11:39.040 --> 11:41.341
Well you're the one
who gave him carte blanche.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.578
Is everything set with the caterers,
the brochures, the music?

11:44.580 --> 11:45.828
Everything is set.
Calm down,

11:45.895 --> 11:47.162
go sit down and relax.

11:47.230 --> 11:49.382
Nothing is gonna go wrong.

11:49.933 --> 11:50.800
Ok.

11:50.867 --> 11:52.068
Ok.

11:52.136 --> 11:53.902
Hey, not over there!

11:53.970 --> 11:56.371
That's where he
told us to put it.

12:00.976 --> 12:02.209
Take it easy.

12:02.277 --> 12:03.210
Watch it!

12:03.278 --> 12:04.978
Got it!
Got it!

12:05.047 --> 12:06.713
It's ok.
We got it.

12:07.882 --> 12:09.382
Ok, Whoo!

12:09.450 --> 12:11.784
Nothing's going
to go wrong, huh?

12:13.454 --> 12:15.321
<i>Pa-tri-cia.</i>

12:16.457 --> 12:18.023
<i>Trish.</i>

12:22.395 --> 12:23.562
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

12:27.932 --> 12:29.243
You're coming
to my party tonight?

12:29.267 --> 12:30.217
I don't think so.

12:30.285 --> 12:31.385
How come?

12:31.453 --> 12:33.420
She can't come
to our party tonight.

12:33.488 --> 12:35.855
She has to stay upstairs
and take care of Carol Anne.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.274
'Cause her mother's having
her own party tonight.

12:38.342 --> 12:39.943
I heard her mother tell mom.

12:40.011 --> 12:42.411
It's my party, not ours.

12:42.478 --> 12:44.413
Listen, Pat,
Pat's not my mother.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.700
And if I wanted to come to
your brother's party, I could.

13:03.414 --> 13:04.847
Hey, Bruce.

13:04.915 --> 13:06.048
You got a second?

13:06.050 --> 13:07.200
Yeah, what's up, Nate?

13:07.267 --> 13:09.535
Come here, let me
show you something.

13:09.603 --> 13:10.603
Ok.

13:13.772 --> 13:15.607
All right.
Where we going?

13:25.433 --> 13:27.134
What? Somebody
broke the mirror.

13:27.202 --> 13:28.134
Replace it.

13:28.202 --> 13:29.669
Oh, not just this panel.

13:29.737 --> 13:32.872
Every panel from the concourse
all the way up to the top.

13:33.507 --> 13:34.507
Hey, Nathan.

13:34.541 --> 13:35.474
Bill.

13:35.542 --> 13:36.608
Mr. Gardner.

13:36.676 --> 13:38.677
You guys have to see this.

13:45.551 --> 13:47.285
We're right on time.

13:58.662 --> 14:02.531
Ice. Now, how the hell
could that happen?

14:03.800 --> 14:06.235
I kind of hoped you'd tell us,
Mr. Gardner.

14:12.174 --> 14:13.507
Sally,

14:13.575 --> 14:15.809
call the heating and air
conditioning contractor.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.677
Tell Stan to get
down to my office

14:17.746 --> 14:20.748
with a schematic for the
ventilation system. Pronto.

14:20.815 --> 14:22.616
<i>Yes, sir, Mr. Gardner.</i>

14:42.350 --> 14:43.551
How come you go

14:43.618 --> 14:45.519
to the Seaton school
for weirdos?

14:45.587 --> 14:48.071
It's for smart kids,
not weirdos.

14:48.139 --> 14:50.189
Yeah, that's why you
don't go there, Pat!

14:50.257 --> 14:51.457
Martin!

14:53.060 --> 14:54.427
There she is.

14:54.495 --> 14:55.828
Yeah, ok.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.486
Thank you,
Mrs. moyer.

15:05.553 --> 15:06.487
Boo!

15:06.554 --> 15:08.422
Seen any ghosts lately?

15:08.490 --> 15:09.957
Leave her alone.

15:10.024 --> 15:11.474
You a cop or something?

15:11.542 --> 15:13.076
Hey, watch it,
you little asshole.

15:13.144 --> 15:14.845
Scott!
Shut the door!

15:23.386 --> 15:25.120
<i>You're so declasse.</i>

15:35.763 --> 15:36.864
Damn.

15:38.266 --> 15:39.799
Carol Anne.

15:40.434 --> 15:41.934
Yeah, I know.

15:42.002 --> 15:44.036
The kids have
started teasing her.

15:44.104 --> 15:45.637
I was hoping we could keep

15:45.705 --> 15:47.439
her ghosts in my closet.

15:47.507 --> 15:49.975
This doesn't make
my job any easier.

15:50.042 --> 15:52.611
That's why you get
the big bucks, doc.

15:52.678 --> 15:53.879
Funny, Deborah.

15:53.946 --> 15:56.047
You could call in an exorcist.

15:56.115 --> 15:57.515
Funnier.

16:16.949 --> 16:18.433
Donna!

16:18.435 --> 16:20.719
I'm really sorry you're
not coming to the party.

16:20.787 --> 16:22.720
I kind of hoped you...

16:23.455 --> 16:24.455
You were...

16:24.523 --> 16:25.690
Oh, Scott,

16:25.757 --> 16:27.908
my knight in shining acne.

16:27.976 --> 16:30.576
Marcie, shut up
and leave them alone.

16:30.644 --> 16:33.796
Maybe we could
catch a movie tomorrow night.

16:33.865 --> 16:35.365
Maybe. Call me.

16:40.770 --> 16:41.937
Excuse me.
Thanks.

16:42.672 --> 16:44.539
He's still panting.

16:44.607 --> 16:47.292
You know, I wish dusty would,
like, pant that way for me.

16:47.359 --> 16:48.926
Jeff's constantly in heat.

16:48.994 --> 16:51.996
I practically have to muzzle him
every night. It's a real drag.

16:52.064 --> 16:54.113
Maybe he could,
like, give dusty ideas?

16:55.166 --> 16:56.833
I don't know if
you could handle it.

16:56.901 --> 16:58.868
Oh, it'll be totally
radical to try.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.404
Get a grip, girls.

17:10.211 --> 17:14.981
<i>This is the second piano
concerto by chopin.</i>

17:18.452 --> 17:21.686
I'll bet all of you
probably think

17:21.755 --> 17:24.022
this was written
by some old geezer

17:24.090 --> 17:26.258
who looked like
Dr. Seaton, hm?

17:28.377 --> 17:31.412
<i>Well, it wasn't.
In fact,</i>

17:31.480 --> 17:33.764
Freddy chopin composed this

17:33.831 --> 17:36.167
when he was only 19 years old,

17:37.369 --> 17:39.803
and he'd already written a lot.

17:39.871 --> 17:42.772
He'd been playing by ear
and making up tunes

17:42.839 --> 17:44.340
since he was 6.

17:46.226 --> 17:47.960
At 8, he had written

17:48.028 --> 17:50.729
his first of several polonaises.

17:51.865 --> 17:54.900
And at the ripe old age of 12,

17:54.968 --> 17:57.869
he was asked to play
for the czar of Russia.

18:00.906 --> 18:02.339
Pretty scary, huh?

18:02.407 --> 18:04.508
Even for
an old-timer of 12.

18:09.781 --> 18:11.214
But in a school like this,

18:11.282 --> 18:14.283
where we're dealing with gifted
children with emotional problems,

18:14.350 --> 18:16.052
what we have to do
is open them up.

18:16.119 --> 18:18.154
So, we try to make them
aware of the fact

18:18.221 --> 18:21.022
that other famous child prodigies
shared similar problems.

18:21.090 --> 18:22.507
It makes them comfortable

18:22.575 --> 18:24.242
to know that they're
not that different.

18:24.310 --> 18:25.710
These kids are about to find out

18:25.777 --> 18:28.011
that chopin was almost
crippled by shyness

18:28.079 --> 18:29.713
and used his music
to overcome it.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.081
Excuse me,
Dr. Seaton,

18:31.149 --> 18:32.599
that little blonde girl

18:32.666 --> 18:34.434
keeps staring at the mirror

18:34.502 --> 18:36.134
as if she sees us.

18:38.305 --> 18:39.638
Do you think she can?

18:39.707 --> 18:40.707
No.

18:40.774 --> 18:43.092
But you think she's
staring straight at you?

18:44.994 --> 18:45.994
Yeah.

18:46.061 --> 18:48.129
That seems to be one
of her dubious talents,

18:48.197 --> 18:49.898
making people believe things.

18:49.966 --> 18:51.164
Has she ever con...

18:51.232 --> 18:52.967
Let's talk in the hall.

19:11.968 --> 19:14.652
She's a very interesting
case, our Carol Anne.

19:14.719 --> 19:17.622
Reasonably well-balanced,
extremely intelligent,

19:17.689 --> 19:19.490
I.Q. Well into the 150s,

19:19.558 --> 19:21.325
and one hell of an imagination.

19:21.393 --> 19:23.126
Most bright kids do.

19:23.194 --> 19:24.927
True, but even
the brightest ones

19:24.995 --> 19:26.613
allow adults to intimidate them

19:26.681 --> 19:27.814
back to reality.

19:27.882 --> 19:28.882
"Hey, dad,

19:28.916 --> 19:30.716
there's a purple cow
in our yard."

19:30.784 --> 19:33.052
"What, are you nuts?
Get out of here."

19:33.119 --> 19:34.519
But Carol Anne's different

19:34.588 --> 19:36.521
than most of our other geniuses.

19:36.590 --> 19:39.423
She seems able
to project her imagination,

19:39.491 --> 19:42.760
convince others that the purple
cow in the yard is real.

19:42.828 --> 19:46.064
Apparently, she actually
convinced an entire neighborhood

19:46.131 --> 19:47.598
that it was haunted.

19:47.665 --> 19:49.165
Yep, there's a talent.

19:49.233 --> 19:52.386
You think she's able to create
some sort of mass hysteria?

19:52.453 --> 19:53.787
No, not really.

19:53.855 --> 19:56.505
It's more like mass hypnosis.

19:56.807 --> 19:57.857
As I work with her...

19:57.924 --> 20:00.793
Try to work with her,
the child's impossible...

20:00.861 --> 20:02.226
The more I'm convinced

20:02.294 --> 20:03.795
she actually might be capable

20:03.863 --> 20:05.430
of inducing mass hypnosis.

20:05.498 --> 20:06.881
Have you put her under?

20:06.949 --> 20:09.283
Only once.
It was terrifying.

20:09.351 --> 20:10.484
For her?

20:10.552 --> 20:11.418
For both of us.

20:11.486 --> 20:14.171
I started to experience
what she was seeing.

20:38.644 --> 20:39.943
Tangina.

20:42.780 --> 20:43.980
My God.

20:45.683 --> 20:47.150
He found her.

20:48.252 --> 20:49.285
Oh!

20:49.352 --> 20:50.819
He found her.

20:53.256 --> 20:54.190
I'm sorry.

20:54.257 --> 20:56.124
Stay and finish your tea.

20:56.193 --> 20:57.725
I've got to go.

21:03.098 --> 21:05.515
Mommy, where are you?
I can't see you!

21:05.583 --> 21:07.050
Where are you?

21:07.117 --> 21:09.152
He's after me, mommy!
He's after me!

21:09.219 --> 21:10.554
I'm scared!

21:10.621 --> 21:12.589
Yes, I am ready!
I'm ready, mommy!

21:12.657 --> 21:15.358
I can't find you!
He's getting closer!

21:15.425 --> 21:16.375
Who?

21:16.442 --> 21:17.476
The man!

21:17.544 --> 21:19.178
The ugly man!

21:19.245 --> 21:20.946
Shh, I've got you, Carol Anne.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.949
You're safe. Shh.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.117
You're in your room
in cuesta Verde.

21:26.185 --> 21:29.403
You're safe.
Everything's calm.

21:29.471 --> 21:30.471
Shh.

21:41.932 --> 21:43.917
Carol Anne,

21:43.984 --> 21:47.218
tell me about
what's just happened.

21:47.286 --> 21:49.504
The man wanted me
to lead him into the light.

21:50.890 --> 21:52.657
It's so cold there.

21:52.659 --> 21:54.041
I heard them talking.

21:54.109 --> 21:55.759
He said it was my daddy's fault

21:55.828 --> 21:57.161
because of the houses,

21:57.229 --> 21:59.931
the houses my daddy built
on their graves.

21:59.998 --> 22:02.098
He said I had to lead them
into the light.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.967
Into the light!

22:04.035 --> 22:06.036
Why do you have to
lead them, Carol Anne?

22:06.103 --> 22:08.070
I was born in that house.

22:09.472 --> 22:10.572
Robbie! Robbie!

22:10.640 --> 22:12.274
The tree's eating Robbie!

22:12.341 --> 22:13.508
Sleep.

22:22.284 --> 22:25.051
I'm going to count to 3,
Carol Anne.

22:25.119 --> 22:28.305
And when I snap my
fingers, you will awaken.

22:28.307 --> 22:30.657
You will not remember
any of this.

22:30.725 --> 22:31.725
1,

22:32.425 --> 22:33.526
2,

22:34.160 --> 22:35.227
3.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.664
How do you feel?

22:40.733 --> 22:42.000
Ok.

22:42.067 --> 22:43.451
Carol Anne,

22:43.518 --> 22:45.053
one word.

22:45.121 --> 22:47.355
How do you feel
deep down inside?

22:48.489 --> 22:49.757
One word.

22:50.992 --> 22:52.459
I don't know.

22:53.395 --> 22:55.694
Well, lonely, maybe.

23:02.386 --> 23:03.785
Lonely, huh?

23:08.024 --> 23:10.392
Sure, why not?

23:10.459 --> 23:13.093
It gets lonely being away
from home, doesn't it?

23:13.095 --> 23:15.530
Yeah. Aunt Tri... Pat.

23:15.597 --> 23:17.965
Pat and Bruce and Donna
are real nice,

23:18.032 --> 23:19.949
but I miss my mom and dad.

23:20.117 --> 23:21.717
And even my brother.

23:33.279 --> 23:34.913
That's very good.

23:35.263 --> 23:36.196
What?

23:36.264 --> 23:38.266
They way you made me
look in the mirror.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.251
<i>I didn't make you
look at anything.</i>

23:40.319 --> 23:43.353
That's what he meant,
manipulation.

23:43.421 --> 23:45.672
What were you looking at
that made me turn?

23:45.739 --> 23:46.790
Nothing.

23:46.858 --> 23:48.124
Carol Anne,

23:48.192 --> 23:49.926
you were looking at something.

23:51.111 --> 23:52.912
I don't want to talk about it.

23:52.979 --> 23:55.147
When you talk about things
that bother you,

23:55.215 --> 23:56.715
they go away.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.883
No, if you talk about
things, they happen.

23:58.885 --> 24:00.284
Who told you that?

24:01.553 --> 24:02.620
Go away!

24:16.200 --> 24:17.750
Are you all right?

24:17.818 --> 24:19.452
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:24.457 --> 24:26.992
What happened?
Wh-what broke the mirror?

24:31.395 --> 24:34.164
A little demonstration
in mass hypnosis.

24:34.232 --> 24:35.499
She made me believe

24:35.566 --> 24:36.934
I saw a coffee mug

24:37.002 --> 24:39.535
fly off my desk into the mirror,

24:39.603 --> 24:40.837
while giving you

24:40.904 --> 24:43.039
a suggestion to smash it.

25:14.134 --> 25:15.834
Beautiful sight, isn't it?

25:15.902 --> 25:18.269
Mmm-hmm.

25:18.337 --> 25:20.938
Did I ever tell you how to
make a little girl laugh?

25:22.240 --> 25:24.141
I never did, huh?

25:24.209 --> 25:26.509
Well, it takes
a lot of practice.

25:26.577 --> 25:29.546
The first thing you got to do...

25:29.613 --> 25:31.598
Is tickle right here
in the ribs.

25:34.902 --> 25:36.135
Hey, don't worry about

25:36.202 --> 25:38.037
that 7 years' bad luck stuff.

25:38.104 --> 25:39.371
That's old wives' tales.

25:39.439 --> 25:40.871
I didn't break it.

25:40.939 --> 25:42.373
Hey, I believe you.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.325
But I'll tell you a secret.

25:44.393 --> 25:46.360
If that old nerd were my doctor,

25:46.362 --> 25:47.511
I would have done it.

25:47.579 --> 25:48.678
I didn't.

25:48.746 --> 25:50.096
He did.

25:50.164 --> 25:51.214
Dr. Seaton?

25:51.282 --> 25:52.382
No.

25:54.518 --> 25:56.851
I don't want
to talk about it, ok?

25:59.422 --> 26:00.589
Ok.

26:02.591 --> 26:04.226
See you, slugger.

26:29.064 --> 26:30.698
How's Carol Anne?

26:31.566 --> 26:33.034
I don't know.

26:36.354 --> 26:38.822
How would you feel
if some quack told you

26:38.890 --> 26:40.574
you had supernatural powers?

26:40.641 --> 26:43.443
Do you remember that guy who
was on all the talk shows?

26:43.511 --> 26:44.860
What was his name?

26:44.928 --> 26:47.129
He was from Israel or someplace.

26:47.197 --> 26:49.648
He used to bend keys,
fixed watches,

26:49.650 --> 26:51.850
took polaroids
of himself in the dark.

26:51.852 --> 26:52.984
Maybe Carol Anne...

26:53.052 --> 26:54.085
Pat.

26:54.087 --> 26:55.720
Please, not you, too.

26:55.788 --> 26:57.672
Give the kid a break,
will you, please?

26:57.740 --> 26:59.374
First your crazy
brother-in-law

26:59.442 --> 27:00.974
uses her as a scapegoat

27:01.042 --> 27:03.577
for those $250,000
collapsible homes he builds...

27:03.645 --> 27:05.262
Oh, Steven didn't...

27:05.330 --> 27:07.997
Steven and your sister have put
that poor thing through hell

27:08.064 --> 27:10.800
with those weirdo psychics
and witch doctors.

27:10.868 --> 27:13.503
Weirdo psychics
and witch doctors!

27:13.571 --> 27:14.571
Come on!

27:14.638 --> 27:16.655
Pat, darling,

27:16.723 --> 27:19.491
you are the only sane person
in your family.

27:19.559 --> 27:20.759
Please.

27:22.428 --> 27:24.695
Don't let that
pompous-ass shrink

27:24.762 --> 27:27.598
tell you she's Carrie or Houdini

27:27.665 --> 27:29.400
or some damn thing like that.

27:29.468 --> 27:31.401
Look, Bruce, nobody really knows

27:31.469 --> 27:34.371
what happened there
this afternoon.

27:34.438 --> 27:37.073
Maybe we shouldn't leave the
girls here alone tonight.

27:37.141 --> 27:38.441
Yeah, well,

27:38.509 --> 27:40.910
maybe we should forget the
opening altogether, huh?

27:40.977 --> 27:42.494
Don't be stupid.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.464
All right, we're both
being stupid.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.832
You've got
opening night jitters.

27:46.899 --> 27:48.433
And I've got a building
falling apart.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.951
Exactly, we really
needed my sister

27:51.019 --> 27:52.553
pressuring us
into taking her kid

27:52.621 --> 27:54.255
like we needed
a hole in the head.

27:54.322 --> 27:57.073
I really don't mind a house
full of beautiful women.

27:58.593 --> 28:00.243
The more the merrier.

28:00.311 --> 28:01.978
Yeah, then hire us a maid.

28:02.712 --> 28:03.812
Swedish?

28:03.880 --> 28:05.748
About 24?

28:05.815 --> 28:07.883
5 feet 2?
Talk about pressure.

28:07.951 --> 28:09.652
Will you go get dressed!

28:09.719 --> 28:11.453
What did I say?
What did I say?

28:27.567 --> 28:28.567
Hi, sweetie.

28:28.635 --> 28:30.769
Can I have a good night kiss?

28:32.072 --> 28:33.139
Ah.

28:33.573 --> 28:34.506
Mmm.

28:34.573 --> 28:36.108
All set.

28:36.175 --> 28:37.675
Have a good night's sleep.

28:37.743 --> 28:39.344
Good night.

28:39.412 --> 28:40.712
Be right with you.

28:43.982 --> 28:46.066
She's got the hots
for him. I'm serious.

28:46.134 --> 28:47.768
I see her every single day.

28:47.836 --> 28:49.503
Look for her at the
beginning of the day.

28:49.571 --> 28:50.571
I'm dead serious.

28:50.604 --> 28:51.764
She follows him all the time.

28:51.806 --> 28:52.739
Will you...

28:52.807 --> 28:53.873
Yeah, we...

28:53.941 --> 28:55.508
Will you do me a favor?

28:55.576 --> 28:56.576
Hmm?

28:56.644 --> 28:58.143
No ghost stories
tonight, all right?

28:58.210 --> 28:59.478
Gotcha.

28:59.546 --> 29:00.546
Yeah?

29:00.613 --> 29:01.547
Yeah.

29:01.614 --> 29:03.081
Ok. Good night.

29:03.149 --> 29:04.099
Bye.

29:04.167 --> 29:06.500
My dad. I don't know
what he's talking about.

29:12.808 --> 29:14.340
Not bad at all.

29:15.510 --> 29:17.176
Forget it.

29:17.244 --> 29:19.679
However, after the opening...

29:38.379 --> 29:40.514
Sandy, I know it's going
to be a great party,

29:40.581 --> 29:42.082
but I can't come.

29:42.150 --> 29:43.583
No, I'm brat-sitting.

29:43.652 --> 29:45.484
She's not even a relative.

29:45.552 --> 29:47.219
Well, she's sort of a relative,

29:47.287 --> 29:48.721
but not really.

29:49.356 --> 29:50.489
Yeah, well,

29:50.557 --> 29:52.991
if Scott wants to call me
from the party,

29:53.059 --> 29:55.160
I might talk to him.

29:58.131 --> 29:59.197
Ok.

29:59.899 --> 30:00.965
Bye.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.718
What you doing?

30:04.786 --> 30:06.720
Eavesdropping.

30:06.788 --> 30:08.655
Why don't you go
to Martin's party?

30:08.723 --> 30:09.923
You know I can't.

30:09.990 --> 30:13.376
I'll cover for you,
they'll never know.

30:13.444 --> 30:15.712
If I get caught, we'll
both get in trouble.

30:15.780 --> 30:17.346
I can take the heat.

30:18.715 --> 30:20.316
Listen, Carol Anne,

30:20.383 --> 30:22.717
I didn't mean what I said
to Sandy on the phone.

30:22.785 --> 30:24.886
Oh, I don't mind being
"sort of a relative,"

30:24.953 --> 30:26.954
as long as we're friends.

30:27.022 --> 30:28.389
Good.

31:02.503 --> 31:05.138
Takamitsu, there are
some people over here

31:05.205 --> 31:07.006
I'd like you to meet.

31:23.321 --> 31:26.423
Hey, it looks like the show
is a success, darling.

31:26.491 --> 31:27.874
Pat! Bruce!

31:27.942 --> 31:30.209
Like the art.
Love the Sushi.

31:30.277 --> 31:31.578
It's nice to see you.

31:31.645 --> 31:34.014
Excuse me, Pat, come here,
I gotta talk to you.

31:34.081 --> 31:35.248
Hello, Mary.

31:35.315 --> 31:38.366
Oh, Bruce, are you trying
to save on the heat here?

31:38.434 --> 31:40.619
Oh, I wish that were the case.
You know, new equipment.

31:40.687 --> 31:42.521
Trying to work out
the bugs and all that.

31:42.589 --> 31:43.904
Good to see you.

31:54.832 --> 31:56.599
Hey, you look great.

31:56.667 --> 31:57.868
Anne Klein II.

31:57.935 --> 31:59.235
Remember, less is more.

32:03.306 --> 32:05.057
Hey, you look great.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.482
Look, maybe I ought to stay
home with you tonight.

32:15.550 --> 32:17.751
Just go already.
I'll be fine.

32:30.414 --> 32:32.947
How come you're taking
your dad's passkey?

32:33.015 --> 32:35.050
I'm gonna use
the emergency stairs

32:35.117 --> 32:36.852
so nobody sees me
in the elevator.

32:36.919 --> 32:38.719
You got Martin's number, right?

32:38.786 --> 32:39.786
Yes!

32:39.838 --> 32:40.871
I won't stay long.

32:40.939 --> 32:42.005
Have fun.
Ok.

32:44.075 --> 32:45.008
Be good.

32:45.076 --> 32:46.276
I will.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.137
Hi.

33:18.204 --> 33:19.238
Hi.

33:21.341 --> 33:23.475
What's the matter?
Is the stereo broken?

33:23.543 --> 33:24.977
No, it's my parents.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.878
I thought they weren't
going to be home.

33:26.946 --> 33:28.113
Tell me about it.

33:28.180 --> 33:29.681
My father's not feeling well,

33:29.749 --> 33:31.816
and my mom says if she
can hear the party,

33:31.884 --> 33:33.118
the party's over.

33:33.185 --> 33:34.685
I thought you couldn't come.

33:34.753 --> 33:37.254
Couldn't stay away
from hot Scott, huh?

33:37.322 --> 33:39.239
Marcie, back to your cage.

33:39.307 --> 33:40.573
It's feeding time.

33:40.641 --> 33:43.476
Psst! 50 bucks,
and she's history.

33:44.060 --> 33:45.277
You're on!

33:45.345 --> 33:46.512
Hi, Donna.

33:46.579 --> 33:47.680
Scott.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.538
Hey, there, hi,
there, ho, there.

33:56.605 --> 33:59.540
I can't believe I risked
getting into trouble for this.

33:59.607 --> 34:01.758
I bet we could
find some trouble.

34:01.826 --> 34:03.510
Your parents aren't home.

34:03.578 --> 34:05.877
Yeah, sounds great.
How many bedrooms you got?

34:07.062 --> 34:07.979
Shut up, Jeff.

34:08.045 --> 34:09.347
Carol Anne's up there.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.848
Is anything open
in the galleria?

34:10.916 --> 34:13.049
Uh, forget it,
didn't bring my fake I.D.

34:14.252 --> 34:15.902
What?

34:15.954 --> 34:17.797
My stepmother's having a party there.
I can't go there.

34:17.822 --> 34:19.462
You're a real killjoy
tonight, aren't you?

34:19.708 --> 34:21.699
Hey, isn't there a pool
somewhere in this building?

34:21.724 --> 34:23.192
It's locked at night.

34:23.260 --> 34:24.426
But...

34:29.632 --> 34:35.002
<i>G-O-R-I-L-L-a.</i>

34:36.103 --> 34:37.638
<i>That is correct.</i>

34:37.706 --> 34:40.341
<i>Can you spell "pheasant"?</i>

34:40.809 --> 34:43.109
<i>P-H...</i>

34:43.177 --> 34:45.177
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

34:50.000 --> 34:51.483
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

35:00.209 --> 35:01.942
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

35:22.095 --> 35:23.462
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

35:39.510 --> 35:40.743
<i>Ha!</i>

35:41.795 --> 35:43.295
<i>We're back!</i>

35:45.482 --> 35:46.649
Leave me alone!

35:46.716 --> 35:47.749
<i>I've got you!</i>

35:47.816 --> 35:49.484
Let go of me!

35:49.552 --> 35:51.019
Let go of me!

35:51.086 --> 35:53.421
Let go of me!

35:53.488 --> 35:54.806
<i>You can't get away.</i>

35:54.907 --> 35:56.039
<i>I've got you.</i>

35:57.625 --> 35:59.659
<i>You can't get away!</i>

36:09.653 --> 36:11.203
<i>You can't get away.</i>

36:11.270 --> 36:12.838
<i>Carol Anne...</i>

36:14.007 --> 36:15.423
<i>We need you.</i>

36:17.093 --> 36:18.810
<i>Come here, Carol Anne.</i>

36:23.581 --> 36:24.614
<i>Closer.</i>

36:29.237 --> 36:32.388
<i>You can't get away.
I've got you!</i>

36:33.758 --> 36:35.290
<i>I've got you!</i>

36:35.358 --> 36:37.059
<i>Break the mirror.</i>

36:37.110 --> 36:40.495
Break the mirror.
Break the mirror.

36:40.563 --> 36:41.914
<i>I've got you!</i>

36:45.034 --> 36:46.450
<i>No!</i>

37:01.581 --> 37:02.581
Hello?

37:03.300 --> 37:04.467
Dr. Seaton?

37:05.085 --> 37:06.751
Who is this?

37:06.802 --> 37:09.003
Carol Anne needs your help.

37:09.071 --> 37:10.739
Kane found her,

37:10.806 --> 37:13.424
and it's all your fault.

37:13.492 --> 37:15.692
Carol Anne,
are you on this line?

37:15.760 --> 37:17.728
This is one
of your little pranks?

37:17.795 --> 37:18.795
Hello?

37:19.264 --> 37:20.580
Dr. Seaton?

37:20.648 --> 37:21.849
Hello?

37:21.917 --> 37:23.215
Hello?

37:23.450 --> 37:24.534
Hello?

37:25.285 --> 37:26.418
Who was that?

37:26.487 --> 37:27.487
A pest.

37:29.490 --> 37:31.756
Bruce Gardner, please,
on Michigan Avenue.

37:31.824 --> 37:33.391
My little pest from the west,

37:33.459 --> 37:35.460
playing her little tricks.

37:36.295 --> 37:37.629
Thank you.

37:43.768 --> 37:45.235
Jesus Christ!

37:48.172 --> 37:49.689
What did that?

37:49.756 --> 37:51.624
It's not a what, it's a who,

37:51.692 --> 37:54.526
and I'm gonna nip that little
prank right in the bud.

37:54.593 --> 37:56.061
Where are you going?

37:56.129 --> 37:58.980
To that art gallery opening
we decided not to go to.

37:59.966 --> 38:01.665
Put dinner on a low flame,

38:02.667 --> 38:04.402
and don't forget the cilantro.

38:08.757 --> 38:12.091
Hello, Mrs. moyer?
This is Carol Anne.

38:14.795 --> 38:16.329
Is Donna there?

38:17.497 --> 38:18.964
Are you sure?

38:21.001 --> 38:23.168
Ok, thank you.

38:34.778 --> 38:35.912
Shh.

38:38.216 --> 38:40.384
Ok, guys, there's a
camera in the hallway.

38:40.451 --> 38:43.185
We'll go in twos. I'll
tell you when to go.

38:43.253 --> 38:44.653
Run under the camera

38:44.721 --> 38:46.555
and stand against the door.

38:46.623 --> 38:47.789
You ready?

38:53.262 --> 38:54.295
Go!

38:59.317 --> 39:00.317
Ow.

39:01.870 --> 39:03.203
Ready?

39:06.457 --> 39:07.490
Go!

39:17.667 --> 39:19.001
Get ready.

39:21.236 --> 39:22.569
Let's go.

39:27.825 --> 39:28.825
Hurry up!

39:28.892 --> 39:29.825
Ugh!

39:29.893 --> 39:30.960
Shh!

39:40.203 --> 39:43.121
Watch the camera.
When the red light goes off,

39:43.189 --> 39:44.266
then go into the locker rooms.

39:44.290 --> 39:46.091
There's always suits
on the clothes lines.

39:46.158 --> 39:47.325
Who needs a suit?

39:47.393 --> 39:48.659
You do!

39:48.727 --> 39:49.961
Come on.

40:45.727 --> 40:47.093
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

40:56.202 --> 40:57.402
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

40:59.839 --> 41:00.956
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

41:13.801 --> 41:16.119
<i>Come to me, Carol Anne.</i>

41:16.187 --> 41:17.888
<i>We need you.</i>

41:17.956 --> 41:20.656
<i>Carol Anne!
Carol Anne!</i>

41:20.723 --> 41:22.108
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

41:36.621 --> 41:40.224
Sam, the stairway alarm
just went off on 70.

41:40.292 --> 41:42.193
<i>Anything on the monitor?</i>

41:44.061 --> 41:46.896
Well, it looks like that
camera ain't workin' either.

41:46.964 --> 41:48.831
<i>Better go check it out.</i>

41:51.534 --> 41:52.801
Come on.

41:52.868 --> 41:54.936
Ok, you knock on the door,

41:55.004 --> 41:58.105
tell Burt you saw some
creepy guy walking on 67.

41:58.173 --> 42:00.274
As soon as he leaves,
we'll go in.

42:01.342 --> 42:02.810
He's coming out.

42:02.878 --> 42:04.511
Where's he going?

42:05.980 --> 42:08.248
He just got in the elevator.

42:08.315 --> 42:09.415
Wait.

42:10.084 --> 42:11.550
Ok, let's go.

42:28.433 --> 42:30.300
What are you gonna do?

42:30.367 --> 42:32.836
I'm gonna run the
videotape back 2 hours,

42:32.904 --> 42:35.806
then I'm going to change the
monitor from camera to v.C.R.

42:35.873 --> 42:36.916
Then when he comes back in,

42:36.940 --> 42:40.107
he'll be watching 2 hours of
videotape on the monitor.

42:44.530 --> 42:46.129
Ok, let's go.

42:46.196 --> 42:47.931
Have you got a key for that?

42:51.002 --> 42:52.703
Yeah. Why?

42:52.771 --> 42:54.020
Beer!

42:54.087 --> 42:55.287
I'm not going to steal...

42:55.355 --> 42:56.755
I got money.

42:57.891 --> 42:59.008
No.

42:59.877 --> 43:01.010
Yes...

43:01.477 --> 43:02.477
No, I...

43:02.511 --> 43:03.445
Yes.

43:03.512 --> 43:04.712
No.
Yes.

43:04.780 --> 43:05.947
No.

43:10.051 --> 43:11.535
Yes?

43:33.138 --> 43:35.139
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

43:37.642 --> 43:40.211
<i>I'm your friend, Carol Anne.</i>

43:42.213 --> 43:44.181
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

43:48.152 --> 43:49.718
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

43:51.571 --> 43:52.905

43:52.972 --> 43:54.206

43:56.009 --> 43:57.275

44:00.028 --> 44:01.362
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

44:03.566 --> 44:04.932
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

44:06.367 --> 44:08.985
<i>We need you to lead us
into the light.</i>

44:10.221 --> 44:11.672
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

44:13.957 --> 44:15.758
<i>Lead us into the light.</i>

44:18.662 --> 44:20.195

44:22.715 --> 44:23.965
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

44:37.278 --> 44:38.311
Come on.

44:39.780 --> 44:41.047
Let's go.

44:48.821 --> 44:49.888
Shh.

44:53.992 --> 44:55.226
Come on.

45:15.944 --> 45:17.178
Come on.

45:25.286 --> 45:27.053
Wanna see real panic?

45:31.291 --> 45:33.225
<i>Whoa!</i>

45:33.293 --> 45:35.043
<i>Pretty impressive.</i>

45:36.646 --> 45:38.663
<i>This is the police!</i>

45:38.731 --> 45:39.981
<i>We have you surrounded.</i>

45:40.048 --> 45:42.917
<i>Come out with your hands up
and your pants down!</i>

45:44.855 --> 45:46.570
<i>Hello, this is your
camp director.</i>

45:46.637 --> 45:48.855
<i>Jeff, quit pissing in the pool!</i>

46:09.425 --> 46:10.691
Oh, shit!

46:15.513 --> 46:17.481
<i>Carol Anne!</i>

46:19.016 --> 46:20.984
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

46:22.186 --> 46:24.187
<i>We won't harm you.</i>

46:24.789 --> 46:26.738
<i>We love you.</i>

46:28.591 --> 46:31.226
<i>You are the only angel</i>

46:31.294 --> 46:33.927
<i>who can lead us into the light.</i>

46:33.995 --> 46:35.963
<i>We would never hurt you.</i>

46:36.798 --> 46:38.532
<i>Never!</i>

46:38.600 --> 46:40.468
<i>Don't run away from me.</i>

46:43.537 --> 46:45.605
<i>We need you, Carol Anne.</i>

46:45.673 --> 46:47.540
<i>Lead us into the light.</i>

46:56.182 --> 46:57.982
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

47:00.719 --> 47:02.019
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

47:10.127 --> 47:11.060
Help me!

47:11.128 --> 47:12.496
Let go of me!

47:12.563 --> 47:13.563
Help!

47:21.737 --> 47:23.105
Carol Anne?

47:24.407 --> 47:26.141
Carol Anne?

47:26.209 --> 47:28.776
Donna! Help!

47:28.844 --> 47:30.077
Help me!

47:30.145 --> 47:31.845
Donna! Quick!

47:32.014 --> 47:34.514
Help me! Donna!

47:34.582 --> 47:35.582
Help!

47:36.784 --> 47:37.817
Holy shit!

47:37.885 --> 47:39.535
Donna, help!

47:39.603 --> 47:40.537
Carol Anne!

47:40.605 --> 47:41.705
Donna, help me!

47:41.772 --> 47:42.905
Carol Anne!

47:42.973 --> 47:44.156
Help me!

47:44.224 --> 47:46.591
Carol Anne!
Just hold on!

47:46.659 --> 47:47.960
Please help me!

47:48.027 --> 47:49.061
Grab on to me!

47:49.128 --> 47:50.662
Donna, pull!

47:56.201 --> 47:59.153
Pull her!
I got her! I got her!

47:59.155 --> 48:00.820
Hang on! Carol Anne!

48:00.888 --> 48:02.089
Pull her! Hold on!

48:02.156 --> 48:03.306
Help me!

48:05.159 --> 48:06.843
Oh! Carol Anne!

48:08.645 --> 48:09.878
Don't let go.

48:10.547 --> 48:11.964
Hold on to her!

48:12.031 --> 48:13.365
Pull!

48:13.433 --> 48:14.433
Pull!

48:14.484 --> 48:16.185
Carol Anne!
Hang on!

48:16.253 --> 48:17.435
Hold on...

48:19.305 --> 48:20.472
Scott!

48:20.556 --> 48:21.756
Scott!

48:21.824 --> 48:22.957
Oh!

48:27.845 --> 48:29.496
Donna!

48:53.051 --> 48:55.119
I love that!
Love it! Yeah!

49:11.683 --> 49:13.751
Smoking more now
and enjoying it less?

49:13.818 --> 49:16.154
Thinking more
and enjoying it less.

49:16.221 --> 49:17.655
Pat, there's something wrong.

49:17.722 --> 49:18.889
Tell me about it.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.890
Takamitsu offended everyone

49:20.958 --> 49:22.058
he talked to tonight.

49:22.126 --> 49:23.393
Excuse me,
Mr. Gardner.

49:23.461 --> 49:24.727
I just got a call.

49:24.795 --> 49:27.396
There's a bunch of kids
partying up in the pool

49:27.464 --> 49:30.266
who claim they're guests
of your daughter.

49:30.967 --> 49:32.301
Excuse me.

49:41.827 --> 49:43.393
Ok,

49:43.460 --> 49:45.195
so you all left
the party together

49:45.263 --> 49:46.496
and they let you in here,

49:46.563 --> 49:49.532
went to the security room
to turn off the camera,

49:49.600 --> 49:51.901
and then where did they go?

49:51.968 --> 49:53.702
I don't know where Scott
and Donna went.

49:53.770 --> 49:56.622
We didn't hurt anything.
All we were doing was swimming.

49:56.690 --> 49:58.790
Where was Carol Anne
through all this?

49:58.858 --> 50:00.174
Not with us.

50:04.580 --> 50:07.414
Ok. Thanks, guys.
Take the kids back to 56-e.

50:07.482 --> 50:08.932
I'll talk with
their parents later.

50:09.000 --> 50:10.067
Right, Mr. Gardner.

50:10.134 --> 50:11.168
Come on!

50:11.236 --> 50:14.305
My parents are going to
ground me till I'm 40.

50:14.372 --> 50:16.072
Hey, it'll give you
time to study.

50:16.139 --> 50:19.108
You might get something
besides auto shop this year.

51:16.642 --> 51:17.642
Donna.

51:17.708 --> 51:18.909
Scott?

51:18.976 --> 51:20.010
Donna.

51:20.811 --> 51:21.845
They...

51:21.913 --> 51:23.247
Scott!

51:23.314 --> 51:25.182
They... they got Donna.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.449
Who? Who's got Donna?

51:26.517 --> 51:29.052
They got Donna
and they got Carol Anne.

51:29.119 --> 51:30.153
Who's got Carol Anne?

51:30.220 --> 51:31.154
They got 'em.

51:31.222 --> 51:32.855
Who, damn it, who?

51:39.129 --> 51:40.262
What happened?

51:40.330 --> 51:42.446
He just came up through the ice.

51:43.598 --> 51:44.848
What ice?

51:44.916 --> 51:46.567
The ice in the...

51:47.602 --> 51:48.969
Pool.

51:53.040 --> 51:54.807
She's gotten to you, too.

51:54.876 --> 51:57.242
It's a suggestion,
Mr. Gardner.

51:57.310 --> 51:59.928
A posthypnotic suggestion.

52:00.130 --> 52:03.699
They got 'em. They got Donna
and they got Carol Anne.

52:03.767 --> 52:05.616
They got them both.

52:05.684 --> 52:06.851
They've got 'em.

52:07.419 --> 52:08.886
They got 'em.

52:27.554 --> 52:29.671
Aunt Trish, help me!

52:29.738 --> 52:31.089
Help!

52:31.924 --> 52:35.026
Aunt Trish, help me.
Please!

52:35.093 --> 52:37.127
Help me!

52:37.194 --> 52:39.430
Carol Anne?
Carol Anne!

52:39.497 --> 52:41.248
Please help me!

52:41.315 --> 52:42.816
<i>She's mine.</i>

52:42.884 --> 52:43.917
Bruce!

52:46.920 --> 52:48.554
Please help me.

52:48.622 --> 52:50.356
Oh! Help me!

52:51.358 --> 52:52.390
Bruce!

52:52.458 --> 52:53.492
Help me!

52:53.560 --> 52:54.793
Hang on, I'm pulling.

52:56.128 --> 52:57.763
Hang on.

53:01.950 --> 53:03.284
Help me!

53:04.119 --> 53:05.486
Aunt Trish, help!

53:05.553 --> 53:07.305
Carol Anne, hold on!

53:07.372 --> 53:08.504
I've got you.

53:08.572 --> 53:09.806
Hold on!

53:11.359 --> 53:12.459
Help!

53:17.147 --> 53:18.447
Help me!

53:19.416 --> 53:21.433
Hold on, Carol Anne!
We've got you!

53:22.268 --> 53:23.368
Pull!

53:24.402 --> 53:25.502
Pull!

53:26.371 --> 53:27.805
Grab hold of her!

53:27.873 --> 53:29.406
I've got her.

53:29.474 --> 53:31.808
Pull!
Don't let go!

53:36.730 --> 53:38.965
Get away!

53:42.268 --> 53:44.136
That's not Carol Anne!

53:45.422 --> 53:46.622
<i>Damn you!</i>

53:54.263 --> 53:55.796
Stay back.

53:55.864 --> 53:57.565
Stay back.
He's got the girls

53:57.632 --> 53:59.199
and now he wants you.

54:00.234 --> 54:01.735
What are you talking about?

54:01.803 --> 54:03.803
The preacher Kane.

54:03.871 --> 54:07.273
He knows that as long as there's
someone on this side that loves them,

54:07.340 --> 54:09.308
you can get them back.

54:09.376 --> 54:12.077
How did you know
that wasn't Carol Anne?

54:13.145 --> 54:15.047
What surprised me, dear,

54:15.815 --> 54:17.549
is that you didn't.

54:20.118 --> 54:21.886
Who the hell are you?

54:24.056 --> 54:26.723
I'm one of your
brother-in-law's

54:26.791 --> 54:28.858
weirdo psychics.

54:28.926 --> 54:30.226
Shh.

54:31.979 --> 54:34.996
Carol Anne and Donna
are not in that room.

54:37.968 --> 54:40.168
Well, some goddamned thing is.

54:40.236 --> 54:41.670
Oh, yes.

54:41.738 --> 54:43.270
Anger...

54:43.338 --> 54:44.606
Rage...

54:45.407 --> 54:46.474
Evil,

54:46.541 --> 54:48.442
they are in that room.

54:49.077 --> 54:51.210
Can you feel the cold?

54:51.279 --> 54:53.563
He's devouring the heat,

54:53.631 --> 54:55.899
the energy.

54:55.966 --> 54:58.434
He's gathering his strength.

54:58.502 --> 55:00.069
We must find the girls

55:00.137 --> 55:01.971
before he becomes too strong.

55:02.038 --> 55:04.389
If Donna and Carol Anne
aren't in that room,

55:04.457 --> 55:05.942
then where are they?

55:06.542 --> 55:08.643
The other side.

55:08.711 --> 55:10.478
Before we can find the girls,

55:10.546 --> 55:13.215
we must find out
where they entered.

55:15.183 --> 55:19.302
Where did Dr. Rasputin
take Scott?

55:21.756 --> 55:23.522
Excuse me, Dr. Seaton?

55:25.926 --> 55:27.260
Excuse us.

55:34.967 --> 55:36.468
Do your stuff.

55:44.843 --> 55:46.960
Ok, Scott,

55:47.027 --> 55:49.329
I want you to look at the light.

55:50.864 --> 55:52.531
Look at the light.

55:53.816 --> 55:55.534
Look at the light.

56:07.028 --> 56:08.346
Security.

56:08.414 --> 56:09.779
Burt, this is Gardner.

56:09.847 --> 56:11.113
Get your guys together, please.

56:11.181 --> 56:13.421
My daughter and niece are
roaming the building somewhere,

56:13.484 --> 56:16.586
and I'd like them found
as soon as possible, ok?

56:18.688 --> 56:19.788
What?

56:20.923 --> 56:22.324
Aw, damn it!

56:23.660 --> 56:24.925
Yeah, ok.

56:27.095 --> 56:28.730
Terrific.

56:30.031 --> 56:32.999
First, the heating, then
the electrical problems...

56:34.001 --> 56:36.970
Now the security monitors.

56:37.037 --> 56:40.306
Oh, Bruce, this is really
happening, isn't it?

56:40.375 --> 56:42.908
Depends on who
you want to believe.

56:46.413 --> 56:48.513
Tweedledum
or tweedle-dumber.

56:54.920 --> 56:56.887
Scott...

56:56.955 --> 56:59.590
You and Donna are
at the swimming pool.

57:00.975 --> 57:02.726
You're leaving.

57:02.794 --> 57:04.577
Where are you going?

57:06.063 --> 57:08.064
The security room.

57:08.132 --> 57:10.566
W-we saw Carol Anne
on the monitor.

57:11.535 --> 57:13.035
Which monitor?

57:14.037 --> 57:15.938
She was in the garage.

57:18.441 --> 57:20.307
The puddle!

57:20.375 --> 57:23.210
Hands came out of the puddle!

57:23.278 --> 57:25.730
They grabbed us, the hands!

57:27.115 --> 57:29.515
Keep her away from me!

57:29.583 --> 57:31.101
Keep her away from me!

57:31.668 --> 57:32.869
Shh.

57:36.339 --> 57:37.739
What puddle?

57:38.674 --> 57:40.409
What puddle, Scott?

57:41.244 --> 57:42.644
What puddle?

57:44.880 --> 57:46.381
In the garage.

57:47.116 --> 57:48.916
In the garage.

57:48.984 --> 57:50.484
In the garage!

58:14.822 --> 58:16.856
They're between dimensions,

58:17.624 --> 58:20.110
behind reflections,

58:20.177 --> 58:22.729
behind mirrors, stealing images.

58:24.664 --> 58:25.931
Carol Anne!

58:27.701 --> 58:29.151
Carol Anne!

58:30.186 --> 58:31.619
Carol Anne!

58:33.388 --> 58:36.006
<i>The light!
The light!</i>

58:37.543 --> 58:39.075
<i>It's so cold!</i>

58:39.143 --> 58:41.628
<i>The light, it's so cold!</i>

58:41.695 --> 58:43.196
Carol Anne,

58:43.831 --> 58:45.832
listen to me.

58:45.900 --> 58:47.933
Find your way back to your room.

58:48.001 --> 58:50.169
You must go back to your room.

58:51.521 --> 58:53.489
<i>He won't let me.</i>

58:53.556 --> 58:55.373
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

58:55.375 --> 58:57.142
<i>I'm so cold!</i>

58:57.210 --> 58:59.177
Find Donna and go back
to your room.

58:59.245 --> 59:00.812
Run, Carol Anne, run!

59:00.880 --> 59:04.448
Enough! Stop
this stupid sideshow.

59:04.515 --> 59:05.933
Oh, it's a great act.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.251
Carol Anne creates the fire,

59:07.318 --> 59:09.003
and you feed it.

59:09.070 --> 59:10.853
You made this happen.

59:10.921 --> 59:12.721
You made her talk about him,

59:12.789 --> 59:14.607
you made her remember him.

59:14.675 --> 59:16.075
He was lost.

59:16.143 --> 59:17.860
You brought him here.

59:17.928 --> 59:19.327
Ludicrous.

59:20.746 --> 59:22.480
It's your choice...

59:23.615 --> 59:25.483
Tweedledum...

59:25.551 --> 59:28.218
Or tweedle-dumber.

59:34.091 --> 59:35.842
Tell us what to do.

59:37.711 --> 59:41.431
Pray that Carol Anne
heard me and listens.

59:41.498 --> 59:44.132
We must get up there
as fast as we can.

59:47.102 --> 59:49.738
This is stupid, idiotic!

59:49.805 --> 59:51.305
What's the matter
with you people?

59:51.373 --> 59:53.407
Can't you see that
Carol Anne's behind this?

59:53.475 --> 59:55.543
She's making us believe
this is happening.

59:55.610 --> 59:57.177
It's... it's all
a hypnotic...

59:57.245 --> 59:59.479
It's about as stupid and
idiotic as you hypnotizing

59:59.547 --> 01:00:01.981
that coffee cup
through the mirror.

01:00:16.345 --> 01:00:17.746
That's good.

01:00:19.315 --> 01:00:21.548
He'll try to trick you.

01:00:21.616 --> 01:00:23.817
He'll try to separate you.

01:00:23.885 --> 01:00:25.452
Don't let him.

01:00:25.454 --> 01:00:28.338
Your love, your bond,

01:00:28.406 --> 01:00:31.007
your caring
for these two children,

01:00:31.075 --> 01:00:33.159
is our most valuable weapon.

01:00:42.201 --> 01:00:44.236
Let me take the chances.

01:00:45.737 --> 01:00:47.104
What's that?

01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:49.473
Some sort of mystical amulet?

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:51.174
A tool of your trade?

01:00:51.242 --> 01:00:52.676
It was a gift

01:00:53.543 --> 01:00:55.312
from a good friend,

01:00:55.314 --> 01:00:57.280
a powerful medicine man

01:00:57.347 --> 01:00:59.966
who walked among the spirits

01:01:00.034 --> 01:01:01.767
and returned.

01:01:03.837 --> 01:01:05.570
There's power here.

01:01:06.756 --> 01:01:09.440
I only pray it is enough.

01:01:17.148 --> 01:01:20.683
Because Kane still
thinks he needs her.

01:01:20.751 --> 01:01:23.553
He was insane when he lived,

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:25.521
and now, in death,

01:01:25.588 --> 01:01:27.589
that insanity

01:01:27.657 --> 01:01:30.059
has become the beast.

01:01:30.126 --> 01:01:32.993
He wants Carol Anne now...

01:01:33.062 --> 01:01:35.396
Before she grows up.

01:01:35.464 --> 01:01:38.899
Youth is a strong life force.

01:01:38.967 --> 01:01:42.235
Innocence is pure life force.

01:01:42.303 --> 01:01:43.736
We lose strength

01:01:43.804 --> 01:01:45.772
as we lose our innocence.

01:01:46.507 --> 01:01:47.524
You see,

01:01:47.592 --> 01:01:51.194
innocence is the only gift
we're given in life.

01:01:51.261 --> 01:01:54.097
All else must be fought for.

01:01:55.466 --> 01:01:58.633
In that gift is purity.

01:01:59.735 --> 01:02:02.204
In that purity...

01:02:02.271 --> 01:02:04.805
Lies strength.

01:02:04.873 --> 01:02:06.907
That's a lot of crap
that doesn't mean anything.

01:02:06.975 --> 01:02:08.509
Shut up, Seaton.

01:02:21.036 --> 01:02:22.571
Unlock it.

01:02:30.662 --> 01:02:33.564
<i>Can you spell "gorilla"?</i>

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.249
<i>"G," "o,"</i>

01:02:36.317 --> 01:02:37.583
Carol Anne?

01:02:37.651 --> 01:02:39.186
<i>"R," "I,"</i>

01:02:40.021 --> 01:02:41.888
<i>"l," "l,"</i>

01:02:42.556 --> 01:02:43.556
<i>"a."</i>

01:02:43.907 --> 01:02:45.724
<i>That is correct.</i>

01:02:45.792 --> 01:02:48.026
<i>Now try "pheasant."</i>

01:02:48.094 --> 01:02:49.862
Look at the mirror.

01:02:49.929 --> 01:02:51.195
<i>"H,"</i>

01:02:51.464 --> 01:02:53.447
<i>"e," "a,"</i>

01:02:54.316 --> 01:02:56.384
<i>"s," "a,"</i>

01:02:57.019 --> 01:02:58.152
<i>"n,"</i>

01:02:58.220 --> 01:02:59.220
<i>"t."</i>

01:02:59.988 --> 01:03:01.588
<i>That is correct.</i>

01:03:01.655 --> 01:03:05.058
<i>Can you spell "parakeet"?</i>

01:03:05.126 --> 01:03:06.526
Carol Anne?

01:03:06.594 --> 01:03:07.960
<i>"P,"</i>

01:03:08.028 --> 01:03:09.228
Carol Anne?

01:03:09.296 --> 01:03:10.296
<i>"R,"</i>

01:03:10.347 --> 01:03:11.714
Carol Anne?

01:03:13.183 --> 01:03:14.316
<i>Try...</i>

01:03:14.384 --> 01:03:16.284
Come back to this
side, Carol Anne.

01:03:16.352 --> 01:03:18.252
Come through the mirror.

01:03:19.688 --> 01:03:22.023
We want you to come join us.

01:03:22.957 --> 01:03:24.825
We miss you.

01:03:24.893 --> 01:03:28.295
You can come back through
the mirror, Carol Anne.

01:03:31.732 --> 01:03:34.934
Please, Carol Anne, come
back through the mirror.

01:03:35.002 --> 01:03:37.603
Come back to this side, sweetie.

01:03:38.671 --> 01:03:40.038
Carol Anne?

01:03:41.107 --> 01:03:42.474
Carol Anne?

01:03:45.111 --> 01:03:46.577
Come to me, Carol Anne.

01:03:46.645 --> 01:03:48.379
Don't be frightened.

01:03:49.314 --> 01:03:50.815
Don't be afraid, sweetie.

01:03:50.883 --> 01:03:52.984
Come to us.

01:03:53.051 --> 01:03:55.251
Won't you join us, Carol Anne?

01:03:56.954 --> 01:03:58.321
Carol Anne?

01:04:02.191 --> 01:04:03.525
Carol Anne?

01:04:07.196 --> 01:04:08.530
Carol Anne?

01:04:08.598 --> 01:04:10.298
Carol Anne, come here!

01:04:10.365 --> 01:04:11.799
No!

01:04:11.867 --> 01:04:13.201
<i>Tangina!</i>

01:04:39.759 --> 01:04:41.109
Don't just stand there!

01:04:41.176 --> 01:04:42.526
Get over here,
for Christ's sake!

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:26.163
I got you, baby.

01:05:26.231 --> 01:05:27.831
It's ok, it's ok.

01:05:33.237 --> 01:05:34.170
Carol Anne!

01:05:34.238 --> 01:05:35.238
You're all right.

01:05:35.272 --> 01:05:36.771
Carol Anne.
Where is she?

01:05:36.839 --> 01:05:38.490
Carol Anne is drowning!

01:05:38.558 --> 01:05:39.841
She's drowning!
Where? Where?

01:05:39.909 --> 01:05:41.310
Carol Anne!

01:05:41.377 --> 01:05:42.377
Donna...

01:05:42.412 --> 01:05:43.412
Carol Anne!

01:05:43.446 --> 01:05:44.379
You're safe now.

01:05:44.446 --> 01:05:45.680
Carol Anne!

01:05:45.747 --> 01:05:47.782
Where?
Carol Anne!

01:05:47.849 --> 01:05:49.516
She's drowning!

01:05:49.585 --> 01:05:51.218
What does it matter anymore?

01:05:51.286 --> 01:05:53.587
Who the hell goddamn cares?

01:05:53.904 --> 01:05:55.071
Baby...

01:05:55.139 --> 01:05:56.089
Carol Anne!

01:05:56.156 --> 01:05:57.807
Take care of her
for a minute, please.

01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:59.275
Carol Anne!

01:05:59.827 --> 01:06:01.193
Carol Anne!

01:06:01.911 --> 01:06:03.545
Shh. It's ok.

01:06:03.613 --> 01:06:05.130
Carol Anne is drowning!

01:06:05.198 --> 01:06:06.399
She's drowning.

01:06:06.466 --> 01:06:08.266
You've got to get
a hold of yourself.

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:11.002
I can't deal with this anymore.

01:06:11.069 --> 01:06:12.903
Bruce, I love you and Donna.

01:06:12.971 --> 01:06:14.405
That's our family.

01:06:14.473 --> 01:06:16.005
Let's get out of here.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:17.908
Let Dr. Seaton deal
with Carol Anne.

01:06:17.975 --> 01:06:19.142
She's your niece.

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:20.210
I don't care.

01:06:20.278 --> 01:06:23.380
I can't take these sick
little games anymore.

01:06:23.448 --> 01:06:26.315
I never should have let Steven
and Diane send her to us.

01:06:26.950 --> 01:06:27.950
Carol Anne!

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:29.151
Bruce!

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:30.653
Bruce, please!

01:06:37.527 --> 01:06:38.743
Carol Anne!

01:06:43.432 --> 01:06:44.465
Bruce!

01:06:52.973 --> 01:06:55.441
Dad! Dad!

01:06:55.508 --> 01:06:56.708
Relax, Donna.

01:06:56.776 --> 01:06:58.510
Relax.

01:06:58.578 --> 01:07:00.212
You're safe.

01:07:00.279 --> 01:07:03.230
You're just having a bad dream.

01:07:03.282 --> 01:07:05.616
We're all having a bad dream.

01:07:06.985 --> 01:07:08.052
Where's my dad?

01:07:08.119 --> 01:07:09.320
I want my dad.

01:07:09.388 --> 01:07:11.321
Lie here and relax,

01:07:12.423 --> 01:07:14.274
and I'll go get your dad.

01:07:21.131 --> 01:07:22.330
Mr. Gardner?

01:07:22.398 --> 01:07:23.949
Mrs. Gardner?

01:07:27.652 --> 01:07:28.820
Hello?

01:07:41.081 --> 01:07:42.449
Carol Anne.

01:09:46.791 --> 01:09:48.192
And they thought I was her.

01:10:06.007 --> 01:10:07.290
Carol Anne!

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:14.780
Carol Anne!

01:10:15.882 --> 01:10:17.366
Bruce!

01:10:18.368 --> 01:10:19.535
Bruce!

01:10:37.284 --> 01:10:38.650
Carol Anne!

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:42.821
Carol Anne!

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:44.589
Bruce!

01:10:44.656 --> 01:10:45.891
I saw her.

01:10:45.958 --> 01:10:47.492
You think you saw her.

01:10:47.559 --> 01:10:48.894
I saw her, damn it!

01:10:48.961 --> 01:10:50.461
Your daughter's upstairs,

01:10:50.529 --> 01:10:52.346
a shivering, emotional wreck.

01:10:52.413 --> 01:10:55.699
Then you run out on me to chase
after that evil little brat again.

01:10:55.767 --> 01:10:57.334
Don't you understand?

01:10:57.402 --> 01:10:58.786
Don't you see what she's doing?

01:10:58.853 --> 01:11:00.536
It's just like
Dr. Seaton said.

01:11:00.605 --> 01:11:02.038
Nothing Seaton said

01:11:02.106 --> 01:11:04.274
explains what happened tonight.

01:11:06.326 --> 01:11:07.492
Come on!

01:11:20.272 --> 01:11:21.539
<i>The man!</i>

01:11:21.607 --> 01:11:23.273
<i>He grabbed my hand!</i>

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:17.904
Remember what Tangina said.

01:12:51.117 --> 01:12:52.217
Open!

01:12:55.922 --> 01:12:57.423
Oh!

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.845
Help!
Help us!

01:13:06.381 --> 01:13:07.381
Help!

01:13:07.415 --> 01:13:08.581
Help us!

01:13:15.788 --> 01:13:16.972
Oh, God!

01:13:27.316 --> 01:13:28.749
<i>Outside in!</i>

01:13:31.903 --> 01:13:34.254
Help us! Help!

01:13:35.456 --> 01:13:36.940
Help!

01:13:38.125 --> 01:13:41.193
Outside in!

01:14:05.532 --> 01:14:07.366
Tangina gave this to me.

01:14:10.036 --> 01:14:11.687
She gave this to us!

01:14:13.957 --> 01:14:15.357
She's trying to save us.

01:14:15.424 --> 01:14:17.057
She's trying to bring
us through this!

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:18.492
It's a lie!

01:14:18.494 --> 01:14:20.361
It's not true, any of this!

01:14:20.428 --> 01:14:22.030
It's not true.
You're a liar!

01:14:22.097 --> 01:14:23.330
None of this is true!

01:14:23.398 --> 01:14:24.531
You're a liar!

01:14:24.598 --> 01:14:26.250
She's trying
to get us through, Pat.

01:14:26.317 --> 01:14:28.652
She's trying to save our lives!

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:30.487
Just hold on, Pat.
Just hold on.

01:14:32.689 --> 01:14:34.339
Just hold on, baby.

01:14:36.075 --> 01:14:37.543
Just hold on.

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:34.609
No!

01:15:40.315 --> 01:15:41.981
Who are you?

01:15:47.671 --> 01:15:49.421
What do you want?

01:15:49.489 --> 01:15:50.823
<i>You!</i>

01:15:58.263 --> 01:15:59.563
Bruce!

01:18:01.537 --> 01:18:03.338
It's not cold anymore.

01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.240
She said we could do it!

01:18:06.308 --> 01:18:08.142
She said we could beat them!

01:18:08.210 --> 01:18:10.044
It's over, baby!

01:18:10.112 --> 01:18:11.478
It's over, darling!

01:18:11.546 --> 01:18:13.579
Oh, I want to believe that.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:15.381
Oh, believe it!

01:18:15.449 --> 01:18:17.217
Believe it!

01:18:17.285 --> 01:18:18.451
It's finished,

01:18:18.519 --> 01:18:20.386
and we did it together.

01:18:42.557 --> 01:18:44.425
Look at you.

01:18:44.492 --> 01:18:45.858
You two are pitiful.

01:18:45.926 --> 01:18:47.193
You know what?

01:18:47.261 --> 01:18:50.446
No, I don't want to know.
I understand these things.

01:18:50.514 --> 01:18:51.981
Anyway, everybody went home.

01:18:52.049 --> 01:18:53.815
And it went fine.
I locked up.

01:18:53.817 --> 01:18:57.252
You two can read about it
tomorrow in the society columns.

01:18:58.221 --> 01:19:00.055
Newlyweds.

01:19:00.122 --> 01:19:03.224
Oh! Donna's been looking
for you. She called.

01:19:03.291 --> 01:19:05.359
She and Carol Anne are
upstairs with that shrink,

01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:07.094
what's-his-name
from the school.

01:19:07.161 --> 01:19:09.161
Maybe, you ought to
talk to him, honey.

01:19:09.247 --> 01:19:12.549
He's probably never met
anybody with a garage fetish.

01:19:13.701 --> 01:19:15.251
<i>Manana, y'all.</i>

01:19:35.420 --> 01:19:37.787
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Stanley,
how are you tonight?

01:19:37.855 --> 01:19:40.189
I, uh, have been doing
some plumbing.

01:19:40.257 --> 01:19:41.424
Sorry for the inconvenience.

01:19:41.491 --> 01:19:43.659
What inconvenience?
We didn't have a problem.

01:19:43.727 --> 01:19:45.738
Well, if there was a problem,
I'm really very sorry.

01:19:45.762 --> 01:19:47.829
But the hot water's
gonna be on very soon.

01:19:51.450 --> 01:19:54.618
Well, I had to say something.
I mean, look at us.

01:19:54.686 --> 01:19:57.154
I didn't get much use out
of last year's salary, huh?

01:19:57.221 --> 01:19:58.989
I think you look great wet.

01:19:59.057 --> 01:20:01.224
Well, you can lie like
that anytime you want to.

01:20:01.292 --> 01:20:02.692
I usually do.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.760
I know.

01:20:05.345 --> 01:20:07.113
I can't wait to get upstairs,

01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:09.048
stretch out in bed, and...

01:20:09.682 --> 01:20:11.499
Act normal.

01:20:11.567 --> 01:20:13.468
Uh, getting upstairs
sounds great.

01:20:13.536 --> 01:20:15.037
What have you got in mind?

01:20:15.104 --> 01:20:17.438
Packing up everything that
belongs to that little brat

01:20:17.506 --> 01:20:19.907
and sending her home
to my sister.

01:20:23.011 --> 01:20:24.761
It wasn't her fault.

01:20:26.698 --> 01:20:28.030
<i>Yes, it is!</i>

01:23:03.751 --> 01:23:05.116
Oh, my God!

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:16.026
Outside in!

01:23:16.094 --> 01:23:16.727
What?

01:23:16.795 --> 01:23:18.462
Damn it!
Outside in.

01:23:18.530 --> 01:23:19.797
That's what Tangina said.

01:23:19.864 --> 01:23:21.964
He controls the inside,
but not the outside.

01:23:22.032 --> 01:23:23.933
We can still get to him!
Come on.

01:24:06.856 --> 01:24:08.388
Don't look down.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:59.118
All right, hold onto this.

01:25:59.186 --> 01:26:00.319
No matter what happens,

01:26:00.387 --> 01:26:01.387
don't let go.

01:26:01.421 --> 01:26:02.454
Ok.

01:26:17.236 --> 01:26:19.103
Fucking son of a bitch!

01:26:41.389 --> 01:26:42.640
Bruce!

01:26:43.575 --> 01:26:44.575
<i>Carol Anne.</i>

01:26:51.833 --> 01:26:53.182
Carol Anne!

01:26:53.967 --> 01:26:55.934
Go away, Pat!

01:26:56.002 --> 01:26:57.086
He doesn't want them!

01:26:57.153 --> 01:26:59.121
He only wants me!

01:26:59.189 --> 01:27:00.623
You don't love me.

01:27:00.691 --> 01:27:02.657
You don't want me here!

01:27:02.725 --> 01:27:04.609
My parents don't love me either!

01:27:04.677 --> 01:27:06.661
They sent me away!

01:27:06.729 --> 01:27:09.246
Kane loves me!
Kane wants me!

01:27:09.314 --> 01:27:12.066
Give me Tangina's necklace,

01:27:12.133 --> 01:27:14.184
and you can have
Bruce and Donna back.

01:27:14.419 --> 01:27:16.019
They're your family.

01:27:16.854 --> 01:27:18.554
I'll go with Kane.

01:27:18.622 --> 01:27:21.207
Your mom and dad do love you!

01:27:21.742 --> 01:27:23.660
They love you very much,

01:27:24.727 --> 01:27:26.561
and I love you, too!

01:27:26.829 --> 01:27:28.646
It's hard for me
to show it sometimes,

01:27:28.714 --> 01:27:30.248
but I do love you!

01:27:30.316 --> 01:27:31.833
No! Save your family!

01:27:31.901 --> 01:27:34.869
They're the ones who mean
something to you, not me.

01:27:34.936 --> 01:27:36.988
That's not true!

01:27:37.055 --> 01:27:40.124
You are part of my family!

01:27:40.192 --> 01:27:43.059
You and Donna
are like my children!

01:27:44.462 --> 01:27:45.829
I love you, Carol Anne,

01:27:45.896 --> 01:27:47.847
and I'll do anything
to prove that!

01:27:48.066 --> 01:27:49.498
You've got to believe me!

01:27:49.566 --> 01:27:51.600
No! Go away!

01:27:51.668 --> 01:27:52.951
Carol Anne!

01:27:53.019 --> 01:27:54.120
<i>Go away!</i>

01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:47.314
Bruce?

01:28:52.286 --> 01:28:53.519
Bruce?

01:28:56.573 --> 01:28:57.973
Bruce!

01:29:00.609 --> 01:29:01.943
Bruce!

01:29:06.815 --> 01:29:07.898
Donna?

01:29:12.203 --> 01:29:13.386
Carol Anne?

01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:18.390
Tangina!

01:29:21.144 --> 01:29:22.144
Bruce!

01:29:27.934 --> 01:29:29.017
Oh, God!

01:29:34.672 --> 01:29:36.457
Where are you, Kane?

01:29:36.524 --> 01:29:38.892
Where have you taken my family?

01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:41.427
I want them back!

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.747
Tangina said you can't take them

01:29:44.815 --> 01:29:47.449
as long as someone
here loves them.

01:29:49.135 --> 01:29:50.135
I love them,

01:29:51.554 --> 01:29:55.473
and I have this...
To protect me.

01:30:14.657 --> 01:30:16.858
<i>The necklace!</i>

01:30:24.700 --> 01:30:26.350
<i>Give me the necklace!</i>

01:30:27.135 --> 01:30:28.402
No.

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:30.186
<i>The necklace!</i>

01:30:30.254 --> 01:30:31.271
No!

01:30:32.907 --> 01:30:34.090
Oh!

01:30:34.157 --> 01:30:35.608
<i>Uh...</i>

01:30:35.610 --> 01:30:36.993
Oh, God!

01:30:40.681 --> 01:30:41.681
Oh!

01:31:05.351 --> 01:31:06.685
Kane!

01:31:09.472 --> 01:31:11.623
Give her back her family.

01:31:12.559 --> 01:31:14.242
You don't need them!

01:31:14.309 --> 01:31:16.827
You don't need Carol Anne!

01:31:16.929 --> 01:31:19.213
I can lead you into the light!

01:31:20.415 --> 01:31:22.349
I have the knowledge

01:31:22.417 --> 01:31:24.450
and the power!

01:31:39.481 --> 01:31:40.648
No!

01:31:40.716 --> 01:31:42.200
Tangina, don't!

01:31:42.268 --> 01:31:44.151
Tell me how to use the necklace,

01:31:44.219 --> 01:31:46.086
so I can save all of you.

01:31:46.153 --> 01:31:47.955
Thank you, Pat,

01:31:48.022 --> 01:31:51.274
but this is the way
it has to be.

01:31:51.342 --> 01:31:54.376
Say goodbye
to Carol Anne for me.

01:31:54.545 --> 01:31:57.113
Tell her I'll always love her,

01:31:58.581 --> 01:32:01.633
and that her nightmare is over.

01:32:05.705 --> 01:32:07.572
Tangina!

01:32:10.325 --> 01:32:11.692
Tangina.

01:32:17.347 --> 01:32:18.882
Tangina, wait!

01:32:21.969 --> 01:32:23.369
Where are they?

01:32:37.533 --> 01:32:38.732
Pat!

01:32:44.788 --> 01:32:46.172
Bruce!

01:32:59.551 --> 01:33:01.019
Bruce.

01:33:33.414 --> 01:33:34.782
She did it.

01:33:36.583 --> 01:33:38.051
She saved us.
