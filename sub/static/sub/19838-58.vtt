<b><i>No way...</i></b>

00:08.800 --> 00:11.600
<b><i>Where did he go, in that condition?!</i></b>

00:12.730 --> 00:13.940
<b><i>Shoot...</i></b>

01:35.990 --> 01:40.990
<b>Fake X And X Real</b>

01:52.590 --> 01:54.300
<b><i>You intend to fight?</i></b>

01:55.060 --> 01:59.480
<b><i>You will abandon your original plan, and 
commit yourself to a baseless assumption?</i></b>

02:03.520 --> 02:05.060
<b><i>You really believe...</i></b>

02:20.770 --> 02:23.060
<b>Smoky Jail, undo!</b>

02:25.160 --> 02:27.340
<b>I see you've made your decision.</b>

02:27.910 --> 02:30.500
<b>Once I stopped to think about it, 
it was pretty simple.</b>

02:30.500 --> 02:33.040
<b>You used your cocoon after I played my card.</b>

02:33.740 --> 02:36.640
<b>Since you went into hiding 
only after learning my agenda,</b>

02:36.640 --> 02:38.620
<b>I knew that was your ability,</b>

02:38.900 --> 02:40.470
<b>and that it was a trap.</b>

02:41.710 --> 02:46.480
<b>Your lack of reaction when I lifted 
my pipe to strike confirmed it.</b>

02:47.610 --> 02:52.520
<b>It made no sense that you showed 
no sign of reacting at all.</b>

03:01.280 --> 03:02.790
<b>Fifteen minutes.</b>

03:05.400 --> 03:08.900
<b>That was how long I expected you to take</b>

03:08.900 --> 03:12.210
<b>before deciding to remove the smoke barrier.</b>

03:13.510 --> 03:19.470
<b>During that time, I intended to slip 
through the smoke and move freely.</b>

03:20.690 --> 03:25.230
<b>You trapped me within that barrier 
to separate me from the King, yes?</b>

03:25.750 --> 03:28.460
<b>Meaning, as long as your 
prison of smoke was there,</b>

03:28.460 --> 03:33.560
<b>your allies would see it and 
conclude that I was still inside.</b>

03:34.980 --> 03:36.920
<b>I decided to take advantage</b>

03:36.920 --> 03:40.260
<b>of that misconception, and 
quietly dispose of your friends.</b>

03:40.980 --> 03:46.020
<b>I knew you would hesitate long enough 
to give me plenty of time to act.</b>

03:47.060 --> 03:50.420
<b>You thought I'd spend fifteen minutes 
waiting in front of an empty cocoon?</b>

03:50.420 --> 03:52.760
<b>You really underestimated me.</b>

03:53.140 --> 03:56.560
<b>No, on the contrary, it appears...</b>

04:00.580 --> 04:01.740
<b>I overestimated you!</b>

04:06.800 --> 04:08.890
<b><i>He instantly broke himself up into tiny particles?</i></b>

04:11.330 --> 04:17.060
<b><i>If that's how he broke through Smoky Jail, 
I wouldn't have seen a thing!</i></b>

04:27.650 --> 04:30.000
<b>You should have waited longer...</b>

04:30.370 --> 04:33.290
<b>Because my strategy was a last resort.</b>

04:34.280 --> 04:40.170
<b>To be honest, I was upset by the 
fact that I'd been trapped.</b>

04:40.450 --> 04:42.080
<b>Not a very good diversion strategy.</b>

04:42.080 --> 04:43.530
<b>You just contradicted yourself.</b>

04:44.280 --> 04:46.760
<b>You made it through the smoke just fine!</b>

04:47.670 --> 04:52.690
<b>At that point, that was all there was to it.</b>

04:53.920 --> 04:58.190
<b>I was under the impression that 
you were a more capable soldier...</b>

04:58.570 --> 05:01.430
<b>One who would carry out his original 
plan and be faithful to his mission.</b>

05:01.880 --> 05:05.950
<b>However, you made some wild guesses 
and removed the barrier.</b>

05:06.640 --> 05:08.950
<b>I must thank you.</b>

05:08.950 --> 05:09.910
<b>Thank you.</b>

05:09.280 --> 05:10.340
<b>Thank you. Thank you.</b>

05:10.340 --> 05:12.610
<b>Thank you. Thank you.</b>

05:11.390 --> 05:13.110
<b>Thank you.</b>

05:13.110 --> 05:14.960
<b>Thank you. Thank you.</b>

05:24.370 --> 05:25.800
<b><i>Deep Purple!</i></b>

05:27.790 --> 05:29.530
<b>Run!</b>

05:42.560 --> 05:44.540
<b><i>I can't destroy them?</i></b>

05:44.540 --> 05:46.780
<b><i>They just break up and reform?</i></b>

05:47.700 --> 05:48.780
<b><i>He's invincible?</i></b>

05:50.950 --> 05:53.790
<b>Thank you! Bye-bye!</b>

05:54.460 --> 05:56.000
<b><i>Don't be fooled...</i></b>

05:56.000 --> 05:57.890
<b><i>He's playing mind games!</i></b>

05:58.310 --> 06:01.540
<b><i>My decision to attack the 
cocoon was the best option.</i></b>

06:02.100 --> 06:06.430
<b><i>No, the moment I second-guess myself, 
I've played into his hands.</i></b>

06:07.170 --> 06:08.550
<b><i>My next job</i></b>

06:08.970 --> 06:11.860
<b><i>is to predict his objective, and stop him...</i></b>

06:13.140 --> 06:15.390
<b><i>To join up with the rest of the Royal Guard,</i></b>

06:15.740 --> 06:18.310
<b><i>to find and eliminate my companions,</i></b>

06:18.560 --> 06:20.550
<b><i>and to reunite with the King!</i></b>

06:20.770 --> 06:21.810
<b><i>That must be it...</i></b>

06:22.680 --> 06:24.730
<b><i>His interests are consistent with mine.</i></b>

06:25.230 --> 06:26.320
<b><i>There's no problem!</i></b>

06:37.560 --> 06:39.580
<b>I'll take this!</b>

06:42.030 --> 06:43.090
<b><i>He's fast!</i></b>

06:43.460 --> 06:45.840
<b>I'll find somewhere safe to throw this away!</b>

06:49.240 --> 06:50.800
<b><i>He got me...</i></b>

06:50.800 --> 06:52.960
<b><i>I can't use any other abilities.</i></b>

06:52.960 --> 06:55.680
<b><i>If Deep Purple is undone, 
I'll be completely helpless!</i></b>

06:56.160 --> 06:59.160
<b><i>I'll have to find a way to get by, 
using Deep Purple alone.</i></b>

07:03.840 --> 07:06.110
<b>Yo, are you</b>

07:06.890 --> 07:08.240
<b>the esper?</b>

07:17.650 --> 07:21.250
<b>What'd you do with Shoot, huh?</b>

07:21.930 --> 07:22.750
<b>What?</b>

07:25.220 --> 07:27.500
<b><i>Eighty-nine Deep Purple puppets...</i></b>

07:27.670 --> 07:29.870
<b><i>The maximum number I could 
produce in my current state.</i></b>

07:29.870 --> 07:33.260
<b><i>I'll use them to support Knuckle as best I can.</i></b>

07:40.490 --> 07:42.270
<b><i>I see what you're doing...</i></b>

07:42.620 --> 07:44.480
<b><i>I'll let you hit me once.</i></b>

07:44.830 --> 07:46.020
<b><i>But in return...</i></b>

07:51.150 --> 07:53.000
<b><i>I'll take your life!</i></b>

08:00.950 --> 08:03.240
<b>Okay, no one's here.</b>

08:03.860 --> 08:05.590
<b>This is our chance to escape.</b>

08:05.590 --> 08:06.540
<b>Let's go.</b>

08:07.520 --> 08:11.240
<b>Man, they said we'd be safe here.</b>

08:11.240 --> 08:14.280
<b>I can't get in touch with Leol-sama.</b>

08:14.990 --> 08:20.030
<b>Since my stomach shrunk, that probably 
means Cheetu-sama's dead...</b>

08:20.030 --> 08:23.560
<b>And I haven't heard anything from 
Flutter, so I guess that's it.</b>

08:23.970 --> 08:27.060
<b>I'll leave to become a Queen!</b>

08:27.450 --> 08:30.060
<b>I'll make you my second-in-command.</b>

08:30.060 --> 08:31.330
<b>How's that?</b>

08:32.370 --> 08:34.070
<b>Help...</b>

08:36.180 --> 08:37.590
<b>Please...</b>

08:37.590 --> 08:39.200
<b>get me out of here...</b>

08:40.150 --> 08:41.200
<b>Help!</b>

08:42.050 --> 08:44.100
<b>Oh, Secretary Bizeff...</b>

08:44.100 --> 08:45.070
<b>You're in trouble.</b>

08:45.070 --> 08:47.250
<b>I can't move my legs...</b>

08:52.600 --> 08:53.970
<b>Whatever, let's go.</b>

08:53.970 --> 08:55.170
<b>This looks dangerous.</b>

08:55.170 --> 08:57.300
<b>What? Wait... Please!</b>

08:57.690 --> 08:59.450
<b>I'm going to die!</b>

08:59.800 --> 09:03.320
<b>No can do... I can't move all that.</b>

09:03.320 --> 09:05.890
<b>Then, could you call for help?</b>

09:06.610 --> 09:08.960
<b>Like, seriously...</b>

09:08.960 --> 09:11.940
<b>I'm in a hurry to get out of this place!</b>

09:12.180 --> 09:15.510
<b>The boss is missing, our link 
with the King is gone,</b>

09:15.510 --> 09:16.780
<b>and the palace is a mess.</b>

09:17.300 --> 09:20.450
<b>I have no reason to stay here!</b>

09:20.450 --> 09:21.910
<b>I'll give you whatever reward you want!</b>

09:22.150 --> 09:24.660
<b>There are mountains of treasure underground!</b>

09:26.360 --> 09:29.670
<b>If you help me, I'll give you anything you want.</b>

09:29.670 --> 09:32.260
<b>So please pull me out!</b>

09:32.740 --> 09:34.340
<b>Where underground?</b>

09:34.340 --> 09:38.230
<b>There's an area for the Supreme 
Leader beyond the shelter.</b>

09:38.230 --> 09:40.840
<b>I've been managing the treasure inside.</b>

09:41.230 --> 09:43.820
<b>I'm the only one with access...</b>

09:44.900 --> 09:47.430
<b>You'll give me anything I want?</b>

09:58.470 --> 10:00.530
<b>You'd better keep your promise.</b>

10:00.530 --> 10:02.730
<b>Or I'll kill you!</b>

10:03.350 --> 10:06.550
<b>Treasure! Treasure!</b>

10:06.550 --> 10:09.790
<b>Treasure, treasure, treasure!</b>

10:10.120 --> 10:11.360
<b><i>It's over...</i></b>

10:11.870 --> 10:13.430
<b><i>This nation is finished.</i></b>

10:13.900 --> 10:16.310
<b><i>That was clearly proven</i></b>

10:17.340 --> 10:21.220
<b><i>when the air assault began before 
I was able to make any arrangements.</i></b>

10:22.190 --> 10:27.230
<b><i>They're probably calling the Ants biological 
weapons, to use them as an excuse...</i></b>

10:27.800 --> 10:30.610
<b><i>If I'm captured by the Federation,</i></b>

10:30.610 --> 10:35.590
<b><i>they'll force me to confess for a cover 
story and throw me in prison for life,</i></b>

10:35.590 --> 10:37.460
<b><i>or they'll execute me, so I can't talk.</i></b>

10:40.500 --> 10:42.190
<b><i>I won't let them capture me...</i></b>

10:42.190 --> 10:43.860
<b><i>I'm going to escape!</i></b>

10:51.140 --> 10:53.890
<b><i>The smoke-user is now out of action.</i></b>

10:54.810 --> 10:56.660
<b><i>Now, I'll go back to the palace,</i></b>

10:56.660 --> 10:59.510
<b><i>evaluate the current situation, 
and return to the King.</i></b>

11:00.290 --> 11:05.270
<b><i>Though I'm sure that even if I stay with him, 
the King will only find me a nuisance.</i></b>

11:06.700 --> 11:07.930
<b><i>Beelzebub!</i></b>

11:06.850 --> 11:10.270
<b>Lord of the Flies
Beelzebub</b>

11:14.320 --> 11:16.960
<b>Go forth, my clones...</b>

11:16.960 --> 11:20.030
<b>Identify the location and status of 
every person inside the palace!</b>

11:22.640 --> 11:25.890
<b>Pouf's Beelzebub was an ability that allowed him</b>

11:25.890 --> 11:29.790
<b>to disassemble into copies of himself 
as small as one billionth his size.</b>

11:30.290 --> 11:35.100
<b>He was able to control the size 
and number of copies produced,</b>

11:35.100 --> 11:38.770
<b>and the smaller the copies, 
the more he could produce.</b>

11:39.570 --> 11:42.280
<b>However, his main body,</b>

11:42.280 --> 11:46.180
<b>which served as a control center, 
could only be reduced to a bee's size.</b>

11:46.950 --> 11:51.400
<b><i>Smoke-man, if you hadn't removed the barrier,</i></b>

11:51.400 --> 11:54.040
<b><i>my main body could not have escaped.</i></b>

11:54.510 --> 11:57.880
<b><i>My combat capacity would 
have been reduced by half.</i></b>

11:59.540 --> 12:02.530
<b><i>I'm sure a puppet master such as yourself</i></b>

12:02.530 --> 12:08.260
<b><i>must know the incomparable difference in 
strength between a clone and your own body.</i></b>

12:10.050 --> 12:13.310
<b><i>Now that my main body is free, 
I have no weaknesses.</i></b>

12:13.310 --> 12:15.170
<b><i>You have lost.</i></b>

12:15.540 --> 12:18.910
<b><i>You should have been more careful.</i></b>

12:19.390 --> 12:21.120
<b><i>If you had, then when you realized</i></b>

12:21.120 --> 12:23.840
<b><i>the cocoon was empty, 
you should have wondered</i></b>

12:23.840 --> 12:28.390
<b><i>whether what had been inside it 
had actually escaped the barrier.</i></b>

12:29.730 --> 12:33.410
<b><i>And if I had spoken to you 
from outside the barrier,</i></b>

12:33.410 --> 12:36.520
<b><i>you should have wondered whether 
that was my real self.</i></b>

12:37.540 --> 12:43.340
<b><i>The plan I executed was an act of desperation.</i></b>

12:43.760 --> 12:49.160
<b><i>I could attempt to confuse your allies, 
but my clones are mere husks.</i></b>

12:49.790 --> 12:53.310
<b><i>Assuming that your allies were as strong as you,</i></b>

12:53.310 --> 12:56.670
<b><i>even if it took a few casualties, 
they would have noticed</i></b>

12:57.200 --> 12:58.920
<b><i>that my clones were fakes!</i></b>

13:01.330 --> 13:05.980
<b><i>Had you comprehended the truth, 
and realized that my main body</i></b>

13:05.980 --> 13:09.180
<b><i>remained within the barrier,</i></b>

13:09.820 --> 13:15.940
<b><i>you would have understood my 
ability, and searched for me.</i></b>

13:17.460 --> 13:18.800
<b><i>If you had done so,</i></b>

13:18.800 --> 13:23.820
<b><i>I would have had no way to 
fight you in my reduced state...</i></b>

13:25.830 --> 13:30.600
<b><i>In other words, if you had maintained 
the barrier as per your original goal,</i></b>

13:30.600 --> 13:33.100
<b><i>your allies may have suffered a bit,</i></b>

13:33.100 --> 13:35.660
<b><i>but you would have been able to defeat me.</i></b>

13:36.270 --> 13:40.500
<b><i>And I was ten-percent resolved 
to accept that fate.</i></b>

13:41.800 --> 13:45.040
<b><i>Your emotions were perfectly 
aligned to accomplish that.</i></b>

13:45.520 --> 13:48.660
<b><i>I suppose the explosion 
must have thrown you off.</i></b>

13:48.660 --> 13:50.260
<b><i>A pity...</i></b>

13:52.050 --> 13:54.850
<b><i>However, I am now free.</i></b>

13:55.620 --> 13:58.810
<b><i>Next, I will evaluate the situation in the palace!</i></b>

14:00.200 --> 14:07.620
<b>From the start of the mission, 
Morel's condition was less than optimal.</b>

14:08.650 --> 14:14.480
<b>His exhaustion and impatience, combined 
with the extreme tension of the situation,</b>

14:14.480 --> 14:19.710
<b>clearly led him to the hasty decision 
to engage Pouf in a battle of nerves.</b>

14:20.490 --> 14:25.340
<b>However, he arrived at the 
perfect time to support Knuckle,</b>

14:25.340 --> 14:27.610
<b>keeping him from engaging Youpi alone.</b>

14:28.280 --> 14:33.160
<b>As a result, it could be said that 
he made the correct decision</b>

14:33.160 --> 14:35.640
<b>to remove Smoky Jail at that time.</b>

14:36.430 --> 14:40.510
<b>And it was more than simply 
a product of coincidence.</b>

14:40.940 --> 14:46.030
<b>It would be valid to say Morel's wealth of 
experience played a role in saving him.</b>

14:47.570 --> 14:50.220
<b>Upon entering the palace,</b>

14:50.220 --> 14:53.110
<b>Morel had weighed the strength of the enemies</b>

14:53.110 --> 14:55.590
<b>against that of his allies.</b>

14:55.960 --> 15:00.670
<b>Subconsciously, he knew that they 
had underestimated the enemy.</b>

15:01.280 --> 15:07.670
<b>When he realized the length of time his allies 
could hold out was shorter than anticipated,</b>

15:08.110 --> 15:15.420
<b>he was led to attack the cocoon in order 
to avoid struggling with the pros and cons</b>

15:15.420 --> 15:19.240
<b>of removing Smoky Jail to go help them.</b>

15:19.780 --> 15:25.690
<b>Morel's cunning, derived from his knowledge 
of the battlefield, saved his comrades.</b>

15:29.450 --> 15:33.620
<b><i>The real one's hidden among the fakes, 
trying to attack me, right?</i></b>

15:34.240 --> 15:37.290
<b><i>This time, I'll land a counter on you!</i></b>

15:44.340 --> 15:45.920
<b><i>Five were taken out...</i></b>

15:45.920 --> 15:47.460
<b><i>I have eighty-four left!</i></b>

15:52.030 --> 15:54.570
<b><i>The smoke ones are fake.</i></b>

15:54.570 --> 15:55.760
<b><i>They feel completely different.</i></b>

15:56.480 --> 16:00.140
<b><i>When the real one lands a hit, I'll know.</i></b>

16:01.100 --> 16:03.520
<b><i>That's when you'll be finished!</i></b>

16:05.870 --> 16:07.260
<b><i>Seventy-five left!</i></b>

16:07.690 --> 16:08.610
<b><i>Seventy-two...</i></b>

16:09.410 --> 16:10.650
<b><i>Seventy...</i></b>

16:18.790 --> 16:21.910
<b>Pitou and the woman are on the 
west tower's second floor.</b>

16:22.350 --> 16:24.240
<b>Pitou appears to be healing the woman.</b>

16:24.650 --> 16:27.240
<b>A boy, who appears to be an 
enemy, is sitting nearby.</b>

16:28.830 --> 16:31.420
<b>Three near the entrance to 
the underground shelter...</b>

16:31.950 --> 16:34.730
<b>Hina, a Soldier Ant, and Bizeff!</b>

16:35.100 --> 16:36.510
<b>They may be heading underground.</b>

16:37.090 --> 16:38.690
<b>Welfin is behind them.</b>

16:39.100 --> 16:41.290
<b>He appears to be following them.</b>

16:42.340 --> 16:45.940
<b><i>The woman was injured by the dragon spears.</i></b>

16:46.850 --> 16:50.260
<b><i>But why doesn't the enemy attack Pitou?</i></b>

16:51.170 --> 16:52.950
<b><i>Could he be acquainted with the woman?</i></b>

16:53.840 --> 16:56.450
<b>One in the soldiers' lounge, in the east tower...</b>

16:56.970 --> 16:59.070
<b>The human captured a few days ago.</b>

17:00.450 --> 17:02.160
<b>It will be born soon.</b>

17:03.120 --> 17:05.130
<b>Oh, this area's crazy...</b>

17:05.130 --> 17:06.580
<b>There are lots of enemies.</b>

17:07.220 --> 17:09.090
<b>One, two, three...</b>

17:10.270 --> 17:12.280
<b>But Youpi is taking them out quickly.</b>

17:13.390 --> 17:16.590
<b>Youpi and approximately fifty enemies 
are in the north area of the palace!</b>

17:17.590 --> 17:20.180
<b>It's the smoke-guy and a bunch of thugs.</b>

17:21.230 --> 17:23.470
<b>Also, a weird fatso with a spike on its head!</b>

17:23.890 --> 17:25.260
<b>Unable to determine if it is friend or foe.</b>

17:26.750 --> 17:29.420
<b><i>Is the spike-head Youpi's true power?</i></b>

17:29.910 --> 17:34.360
<b><i>Only one of the thugs is real, 
while the rest are made of smoke.</i></b>

17:34.950 --> 17:37.190
<b><i>The number of puppets is not increasing</i></b>

17:37.190 --> 17:39.930
<b><i>because he needs the pipe to make more.</i></b>

17:40.590 --> 17:44.370
<b><i>It'll take Youpi less than a minute 
to find the real one.</i></b>

17:46.570 --> 17:49.130
<b><i>The King is gone! Where is he?</i></b>

17:50.090 --> 17:52.730
<b>Everyone, return!</b>

18:04.840 --> 18:06.060
<b><i>What's wrong?</i></b>

18:06.060 --> 18:08.150
<b><i>You're running out of clones.</i></b>

18:08.450 --> 18:13.650
<b><i>My attacks are too fast for you to get close.</i></b>

18:15.140 --> 18:21.160
<b><i>Should I leave an opening for 
him to come in and attack?</i></b>

18:21.860 --> 18:23.150
<b><i>Carefully...</i></b>

18:24.290 --> 18:25.680
<b><i>Act natural.</i></b>

18:26.980 --> 18:28.850
<b><i>Here you go...</i></b>

18:29.920 --> 18:30.670
<b><i>Come on!</i></b>

18:51.060 --> 18:52.190
<b><i>He's a fake?</i></b>

18:55.150 --> 18:56.650
<b><i>Wait...</i></b>

18:57.490 --> 19:00.450
<b>You finally figured it out, idiot?</b>

19:01.480 --> 19:04.570
<b>There never was a real one.</b>

19:10.310 --> 19:11.960
<b>I'll kill you!</b>

19:17.240 --> 19:19.720
<b>There<i> is</i> a real one, right here!</b>

19:20.430 --> 19:22.760
<b>No kidding!</b>

19:31.180 --> 19:32.610
<b><i>An aura explosion?</i></b>

19:33.060 --> 19:33.940
<b><i>From Youpi?</i></b>

19:34.500 --> 19:36.760
<b><i>Did he really need to use such an ability?</i></b>

19:44.940 --> 19:46.740
<b><i>I'm worried...</i></b>

19:47.400 --> 19:51.070
<b><i>But locating the King is my first priority!</i></b>

19:52.690 --> 19:54.440
<b><i>You saved me, boss!</i></b>

19:54.790 --> 19:56.750
<b><i>If you hadn't set that restriction,</i></b>

19:56.750 --> 19:59.160
<b><i>I would have snapped and rushed him!</i></b>

20:01.740 --> 20:02.650
<b><i>Listen to me...</i></b>

20:03.280 --> 20:06.810
<b><i>I will create only angry clones of you</i></b>

20:06.810 --> 20:10.820
<b><i>when you've lost control of your temper.</i></b>

20:11.480 --> 20:15.510
<b><i>If that happens, you are to join the clones,</i></b>

20:15.510 --> 20:18.560
<b><i>and give careful thought to what must be done.</i></b>

20:19.320 --> 20:20.790
<b><i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i></b>

20:20.790 --> 20:22.320
<b><i>I got it.</i></b>

20:23.650 --> 20:26.530
<b><i>After cooling down and thinking about it,</i></b>

20:26.530 --> 20:29.770
<b><i>I realized that he wouldn't have taken Shoot.</i></b>

20:30.420 --> 20:34.720
<b><i>But if Shoot couldn't move on his own, 
who would have moved him?</i></b>

20:35.770 --> 20:37.710
<b><i>Damn... Stop thinking about it!</i></b>

20:38.240 --> 20:41.300
<b><i>I need to focus on the opponent before me!</i></b>

20:47.780 --> 20:49.020
<b><i>Where...</i></b>

20:51.090 --> 20:52.210
<b><i>am I?</i></b>

20:57.780 --> 20:58.770
<b><i>That's...</i></b>

21:10.490 --> 21:13.080
<b>Uh-oh!</b>

21:13.470 --> 21:15.120
<b>Hurry up!</b>

21:15.120 --> 21:16.960
<b>Go in before the entrance is blocked!</b>

21:17.920 --> 21:20.710
<b><i>Damn, Bizeff is my prey!</i></b>

21:21.430 --> 21:25.210
<b><i>If I knew what powers they had, 
I could make a move.</i></b>

21:40.850 --> 21:44.740
<b>Don't come any closer...</b>

21:47.180 --> 21:47.990
<b>Pouf!</b>

23:24.990 --> 23:27.310
<b>Next time: Defeat x and x Dignity.</b>

23:27.670 --> 23:29.170
<b>I'm Gon.</b>

23:29.470 --> 23:30.720
<b>And that's all there is to it.</b>

23:30.720 --> 23:32.450
<b>I'm Killua!</b>

23:32.450 --> 23:33.830
<b>And that's all there is to it.</b>
