00:50.451 --> 00:52.885
Rainbow time.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.058
Damn it.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.572
Hey, are you awake?

01:16.911 --> 01:18.444
Lindsay, are you awake?

01:19.113 --> 01:20.846
Hm?

01:20.848 --> 01:23.348
Do you remember the first
time we held hands?

01:24.718 --> 01:26.285
We were walking into that diner

01:26.287 --> 01:28.120
after staying up
all night together.

01:31.025 --> 01:32.357
Hm.

01:32.359 --> 01:33.359
I just...

01:33.961 --> 01:35.494
Never thought I'd...

01:36.564 --> 01:37.996
Find someone like you.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.366
Well, me too, sweetie.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.571
Probably my brother again.

01:48.843 --> 01:51.410
We should go
if we want to be on time.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.178
Okay?

01:54.148 --> 01:55.247
I love you.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.515
I love you.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.563
<i>Hey...</i>

02:14.168 --> 02:15.200
<i>Hey, bro.</i>

02:15.202 --> 02:17.503
<i>Um, can you please call me back,</i>

02:17.505 --> 02:19.872
<i>and let me know that
you're bringing a tape?</i>

02:19.874 --> 02:22.007
<i>Also, ask Lindsay</i>

02:22.009 --> 02:24.810
<i>if she's cool with being in it.</i>

02:24.812 --> 02:28.480
Maybe she doesn't mind
doing some nudity?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.149
Some tasteful nudity?

02:30.551 --> 02:31.984
For the scene.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.286
It would be good for the story.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.723
Just kidding, bro, all right?

02:37.725 --> 02:39.024
Don't...

02:39.426 --> 02:40.792
Don't worry.

02:40.794 --> 02:43.362
<i>I mean, unless she
really wants to.</i>

02:43.364 --> 02:45.531
<i>I don't know,
maybe she's kind of a...</i>

02:45.533 --> 02:47.232
<i>A little freaky.</i>

02:47.234 --> 02:50.302
<i>All right, well,
please call me back.</i>

02:50.304 --> 02:51.570
This is Shonzi.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.671
Duh.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.245
Rainbow time.

03:01.182 --> 03:02.247
Hey...

03:11.125 --> 03:12.724
What's that?

03:12.726 --> 03:14.459
Oh, Gretchen, my boss,

03:14.461 --> 03:15.561
posted the video we made.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.513
Oh, cool.

03:17.514 --> 03:19.464
Yeah, but some
of these comments are...

03:19.833 --> 03:21.033
Really crazy.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.903
Damn it, dude.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.605
He keeps calling
'cause he wants to...

03:26.607 --> 03:29.341
Wants us to shoot
this stupid movie with him.

03:29.343 --> 03:31.910
Oh, he's just
so excited, it's cute.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.178
You know why?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.846
'Cause you're gonna be there,

03:34.848 --> 03:36.248
it has nothing to do with me.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.849
Just so you know,
I'm warning you.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.986
Now, what is his...

03:40.988 --> 03:43.855
Challenge again?
I can't remember.

03:43.857 --> 03:44.923
Is it down's?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.125
No, no, he's just a little slow,

03:47.127 --> 03:51.330
and in the womb,
he didn't get enough oxygen

03:51.332 --> 03:53.665
because of his umbilical cord
or something

03:53.667 --> 03:54.833
wrapped around his neck.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.668
- Oh.
- Ah, yeah.

03:57.504 --> 03:58.837
Well, there's also...

03:58.839 --> 04:00.539
Also, there was this...

04:00.541 --> 04:02.307
Incident when we were kids.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.443
He likes to hold that over me.

04:05.179 --> 04:06.378
What happened to him?

04:06.380 --> 04:08.981
I ran him over, in a car...

04:08.983 --> 04:10.549
Oh, Todd!

04:10.551 --> 04:11.783
I know.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.186
I was playing in my dad's car,

04:14.188 --> 04:16.654
I didn't see him behind it.

04:16.656 --> 04:19.257
Why was he behind it?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.692
'Cause he was
humping the ground.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.212
Oh, hi, Shonzi.

04:40.214 --> 04:41.847
What do you want?

04:44.752 --> 04:47.252
Ew!
Get out of here!

04:47.254 --> 04:50.155
Wait, but I really like you.

04:50.157 --> 04:54.893
I saw you laughing at me
with those girls.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.629
You were pretending
that you liked me?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.666
And you're just trying
to mess with me.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.800
And that's not cool.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.770
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.505
Let me make it up to you.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.906
What do you have in mind?

05:07.908 --> 05:09.107
Here.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.544
Mm.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.112
Hey...

05:19.753 --> 05:21.753
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.994
Okay, if my dad asks us
to stay the night,

05:28.996 --> 05:30.495
let's just say that
we have something

05:30.497 --> 05:33.432
early in the morning,
and we can't, please?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.067
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.636
I know that you're
stressed out about this,

05:37.638 --> 05:41.106
but if you think you're
gonna have a bad time,

05:41.108 --> 05:43.175
then you probably will.

05:43.177 --> 05:44.876
You don't know Shonzi.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.212
He's a lot.
He's a lot.

05:47.214 --> 05:50.082
- He's a lot?
- Yeah.

05:50.084 --> 05:52.517
Well, did you use
the essential oil blend

05:52.519 --> 05:53.518
that I made you?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.287
- No.
- No?

05:55.289 --> 05:56.888
I think I left it at home.

05:56.890 --> 05:57.989
- We should go back.

05:57.991 --> 06:00.792
No, I know you're kidding.

06:00.794 --> 06:01.960
It's very funny,

06:01.962 --> 06:04.396
but it does actually
really help.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.731
Yeah.

06:06.967 --> 06:09.134
Oh. Oh, yeah.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.770
Oh, oh, oh...

06:12.506 --> 06:14.139
Hey!

06:14.141 --> 06:16.174
You can't just barge in, dad!

06:16.176 --> 06:18.910
You're in here playing
with your fuckin' dolls?

06:18.912 --> 06:20.112
I asked you to help me
an hour ago.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.980
I asked you to straighten up.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.749
Yeah, well, I'm
working on the movie

06:23.751 --> 06:25.484
that I'm gonna make
with Todd and Lindsay.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.386
Please, tonight,

06:27.388 --> 06:30.522
can we just have
a nice, normal dinner?

06:30.524 --> 06:33.091
Dad, we're gonna have
a normal dinner, all right?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.893
But we're working on this movie,

06:34.895 --> 06:36.962
and you gotta
give me time for that.

06:38.132 --> 06:39.898
- I'll get that, all right?
- Wait, no...

06:39.900 --> 06:41.133
Dump the garbage,

06:41.135 --> 06:42.300
take my jacket off.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.802
- Well, I got...
- Take it off!

06:43.804 --> 06:45.537
I got to do something.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.245
We don't want any.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.615
- Oh...

06:57.117 --> 06:59.518
Very funny, dad, okay...

07:01.021 --> 07:03.288
- Hi.
- Welcome, welcome.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.857
- Come on in.
- Good one. Thank you.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.793
Welcome to our humble abode.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.127
- Oh, wow.
- Hey, dad.

07:09.129 --> 07:10.495
Todd, good to see you.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.998
You too.
So, this is Lindsay.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.499
- Hi.
- Hey, Lindsay.

07:14.501 --> 07:16.134
- So nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

07:16.136 --> 07:17.369
Good to meet you.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.005
Hi!

07:20.007 --> 07:21.473
Now I know why

07:21.475 --> 07:23.475
you haven't been
answering my calls.

07:24.961 --> 07:26.444
- Wow!
- Would you like a glass of wine?

07:26.447 --> 07:27.946
- Sure.
- -That'd be great.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.114
Good idea, dad.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.450
Yeah, this is my brother, Shaun.

07:31.452 --> 07:32.384
Or Shonzi.

07:32.386 --> 07:34.519
Or Arthur Shonzarelli.

07:34.521 --> 07:36.188
Okay, great.

07:36.190 --> 07:37.556
- Come here.
- Hi...

07:37.558 --> 07:40.425
So nice to finally
meet you, Shonzi.

07:40.427 --> 07:42.360
Dude, look at this hug.

07:42.362 --> 07:44.329
- I'm looking at it.
- Oh, man.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.898
Something's happening here.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.200
Begin an erection...

07:50.337 --> 07:52.571
What took you so long?
Did you get the tape?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.172
What tape?

07:54.174 --> 07:55.907
I don't know what tape
you're talking about.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.642
- Good one.
- Thanks.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.094
You're very brave.

07:59.095 --> 08:00.545
I would not get into
a car with this guy.

08:00.547 --> 08:02.113
You know, he ran my head over?

08:02.115 --> 08:03.415
I heard about that.

08:03.417 --> 08:06.284
Wow! Not even two minutes,
and you brought that up.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.319
Well, I'm sorry.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.587
When you get your head run over,

08:08.589 --> 08:10.188
it's a little hard
not to forget!

08:10.190 --> 08:12.724
- Okay.
- -Yeah, I bet.

08:12.726 --> 08:15.060
Don't worry,
I'm still pretty cool.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.828
Like the Fonz.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.997
- Hey...
- Yes, hey...

08:18.999 --> 08:20.599
- Does that say "ah?"
- Oh, my gosh!

08:20.601 --> 08:21.500
It says, "ah."

08:21.502 --> 08:24.503
Uh, no.
It says, "hey..."

08:24.505 --> 08:26.004
I'm pretty sure it says,

08:26.640 --> 08:28.406
"ah..."

08:28.408 --> 08:30.575
What, 'cause of the "h"?

08:30.577 --> 08:34.044
Yeah, 'cause
of the a-h-h.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.514
It looks awesome.

08:35.749 --> 08:37.015
Ahh-some.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.316
Ahh-some.

08:38.318 --> 08:39.683
- Yeah.
- -Or a-some.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.820
All right, all right,
you got me.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.922
I spelled it "ah..."

08:43.924 --> 08:45.190
As a joke!

08:46.326 --> 08:48.426
I thought that'd be funny
if he's like,

08:48.428 --> 08:49.427
"ah!"

08:49.429 --> 08:51.263
- It's funny.
- -It is funny.

08:51.265 --> 08:53.098
Yeah, that was the joke.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.033
- All right.
- -Okay.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.468
I got the first shot set up.

08:56.470 --> 08:57.769
Okay.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.010
I'm back!

09:05.012 --> 09:06.278
How did you find me?

09:06.280 --> 09:08.079
Never mind how I found you.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.881
Tell me where she is.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.483
Don't even think about it.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.489
What the...

09:17.958 --> 09:18.957
Hey...

09:18.959 --> 09:20.325
- Ow!
- Oh...

09:20.327 --> 09:22.260
Dude, not so fuckin' hard.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.628
Sorry! Don't
break character, though.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.163
You're gonna break the glasses.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.231
Take 'em off, then.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.332
Don't take them off.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.000
- Yeah.
- They look so cool.

09:29.536 --> 09:30.669
Really?

09:30.671 --> 09:32.103
- I don't know.
- I think they look really cool.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.738
I think they look sexy.

09:33.740 --> 09:34.940
Here, switch with me.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.041
No, you can't,

09:36.043 --> 09:37.442
it's not going to match the
stuff we already shot.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.810
I don't care, I wanna wear them.

09:38.812 --> 09:39.878
Okay, whatever.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.050
Do I look good?

09:45.052 --> 09:46.851
- Yeah.
- You look great.

09:46.853 --> 09:48.053
Tell me where she is.

09:48.055 --> 09:49.387
Jesus Christ.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.689
Please don't kill me.

09:51.892 --> 09:52.757
Too late.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.493
Here's your stupid glasses back.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.395
Now, does it match?

09:58.599 --> 10:00.432
Hey...

10:02.035 --> 10:03.335
Lindsay.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.503
Dude, you just
threw those glasses at me.

10:06.406 --> 10:08.840
You shouldn't have
glasses on right now.

10:10.877 --> 10:11.910
Lindsay.

10:13.747 --> 10:14.813
Lindsay!

10:15.983 --> 10:17.415
Oh, there you are.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.950
What did he do to you?

10:18.952 --> 10:19.884
Help!

10:19.886 --> 10:21.019
Are you all right?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.321
Oh.

10:23.323 --> 10:25.790
Shonzi, thank you so much.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.258
You're welcome.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.160
Now for my reward.

10:29.162 --> 10:30.261
And cut.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.063
- Good.
- What?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.131
That was great.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.532
They gotta kiss.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.134
Maybe we could...

10:36.136 --> 10:37.836
Hey, guys!
Dinner's ready.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.272
Special with the Shonzi.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.674
Oh yeah.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.909
That was a long hug.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.679
I was just trying
to be friendly.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.581
- Yeah, I know.
- I would not do that.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.383
I could steal her away from you.

10:51.385 --> 10:52.417
I know you could.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.786
Oh, my god.

10:54.788 --> 10:59.090
You guys are so cute
in these pictures.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.291
I'm the cute one.

11:00.293 --> 11:01.426
You're both cute.

11:01.428 --> 11:02.894
- Hear that?
- Yeah.

11:04.464 --> 11:05.630
Oh...

11:07.100 --> 11:08.767
This is so sweet.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.670
Me and Gilma in palm Springs.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.038
Yeah.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.639
Before she got sick.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.175
I'm really sorry for your loss.

11:17.711 --> 11:18.877
Thank you.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.646
So I got a new iPhone,

11:21.648 --> 11:24.749
and I was thinking
I could give you my old one.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.184
- What?
- Yeah.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.452
The iPhone 5?

11:27.788 --> 11:29.187
The 5s.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.089
Dude, are you serious?

11:31.091 --> 11:32.090
Yeah.

11:32.092 --> 11:35.193
Any videos of Lindsay on here?

11:35.195 --> 11:36.394
No.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.862
All right, photos?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.481
Shut the fuck up.

11:39.482 --> 11:41.099
Just change the subject,
what are you doing?

11:41.101 --> 11:43.468
I just want to know
you're happy, everything good?

11:43.470 --> 11:44.803
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

11:44.805 --> 11:45.737
Yeah, we're fine.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.772
How long you guys been together?

11:47.774 --> 11:51.276
Officially, um, six months.

11:51.278 --> 11:52.944
But a little longer.

11:52.946 --> 11:54.979
I mean, we knew
each other before that,

11:54.981 --> 11:56.548
when she had a husband.

11:56.550 --> 11:57.782
Oh, whoa, wait.

11:57.784 --> 12:00.452
You guys hooked up
when she was still married?

12:00.454 --> 12:03.421
- Yeah.
- Oh, you dog!

12:03.423 --> 12:06.291
No, no, her husband was
on the way out, anyway.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.526
It was special.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.095
It was sweet.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.331
We went dancing
together all the time.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.332
Yeah.

12:14.334 --> 12:15.900
You like to dance?

12:15.902 --> 12:17.302
I do, I love it.

12:17.304 --> 12:19.804
But I can never get Todd
to go with me.

12:19.806 --> 12:21.039
Here, come here.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.141
Really?

12:25.112 --> 12:27.278
- Step back.
- Mm-hm.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.580
Now, sideways.

12:28.949 --> 12:29.881
Feet together.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.517
Okay, now a little dip
on the back.

12:34.821 --> 12:35.687
Sideways.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.622
- Oh, I love it!
- Back.

12:37.624 --> 12:41.226
So, you might wanna bring it up.

12:41.228 --> 12:43.394
She'll just think
it is perverted.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.029
How do you know
if you don't ask?

12:45.031 --> 12:46.030
Trust me.

12:46.032 --> 12:48.299
You don't...
You don't understand.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.101
Oh yeah, right.
I don't understand.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.202
I forgot I'm slow.

12:52.539 --> 12:53.671
I hate when you do that.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.373
I hate when you pull that card.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.008
You're not retarded.

12:58.044 --> 13:00.545
You're not special.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.514
I'm not special?

13:02.516 --> 13:04.949
I thought I was pretty...
I got special sauce

13:04.951 --> 13:06.351
all over my room!

13:08.622 --> 13:09.954
Good to see you, bro.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.056
I'm gonna bring
a UV light over there.

13:12.058 --> 13:15.160
Oh god, I bet it would
light that room up.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.398
Feet together.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.501
Aw, thank you.
That was so special.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.637
Dad, don't be a pervert.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.272
Who wants a little more wine?

13:27.274 --> 13:29.140
- Me! I do.
- Good.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.408
No, I'm good.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.911
Um, I'm driving, so I gotta...

13:32.913 --> 13:35.313
You guys should just
stay the night.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.614
That's easy.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.418
Come on. Sleepover!

13:40.420 --> 13:42.320
I think we should.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.624
Okay.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.897
- Here, come.
- What?

13:52.899 --> 13:54.532
Just want to talk to
you for a minute.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.501
Okay, what are you doing?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.669
What is this?

13:57.671 --> 13:59.504
There's just something
super important...

13:59.506 --> 14:01.706
I just have
to talk to you, okay?

14:03.443 --> 14:06.811
Um, you just
need to act... there.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.813
Okay.

14:18.258 --> 14:19.390
What are you doing?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.758
What are you doing?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.644
Is this okay?

14:40.513 --> 14:41.746
Yeah.

14:42.782 --> 14:43.782
Okay.

14:57.430 --> 14:58.763
Uh...

15:02.636 --> 15:03.968
What's wrong?

15:03.970 --> 15:04.736
Nothing.

15:04.738 --> 15:05.737
Did I do something?

15:05.739 --> 15:07.071
- Teeth?
- No, no.

15:16.650 --> 15:18.082
- Just tell me...
- It's good.

15:18.084 --> 15:19.384
It's great, uh...

15:19.386 --> 15:21.152
I just have to go
to the bathroom.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.054
- Okay?
- Oh, okay.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.804
Hey, what are you doing?

15:40.373 --> 15:41.439
Nothing.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.540
Reading.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.876
- What the fuck you doing?
- Calm down, bro.

15:44.878 --> 15:46.644
Look, she wouldn't
have seen me, man,

15:46.646 --> 15:47.779
just chill out.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.580
Maybe I don't wanna
look at my brother

15:49.582 --> 15:51.149
when I'm getting
a fucking blow job.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.183
Okay, well, calm down.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.551
It's not like I haven't
seen you before.

15:53.553 --> 15:56.721
You are not to say a word
of that to Lindsay.

15:56.723 --> 15:57.822
- Okay?
- All right.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.557
Don't say anything about that.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.758
Why?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.860
'Cause Lucy was
very different, okay?

16:02.862 --> 16:05.563
Well, maybe you should tell
your girlfriend what you like.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.098
Give me the phone.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.700
Let me just finish watching it.

16:08.702 --> 16:09.867
No, dude, I'm gonna delete it.

16:09.869 --> 16:11.569
- Give me the phone.
- Come on, man.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.171
- You owe me.
- Give me the fucking phone.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.472
You owe me.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.640
- Give me the phone.
- Hey!

16:15.642 --> 16:17.775
Dude! Dude,
what are you doing?

16:17.777 --> 16:19.477
It's mine!

16:19.479 --> 16:21.579
Come on, Shonzi, stop it!

16:21.581 --> 16:22.880
Stop, stop it!

16:22.882 --> 16:25.216
- Dude, no! Come on!
- Give me the phone!

16:25.218 --> 16:26.584
Hey!

16:26.586 --> 16:28.586
What is going on here?

16:28.588 --> 16:30.154
He was spying on us.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.459
Well, you didn't have to hit me.

16:35.762 --> 16:37.028
Come on, we're going home.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.096
What?

16:41.034 --> 16:42.367
Uh!

16:42.369 --> 16:43.501
Dude!

17:08.694 --> 17:11.229
Jesus Christ.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.665
Oh, I wonder who that is.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.234
He won't stop.

17:18.605 --> 17:19.904
Oh...

17:21.074 --> 17:23.174
Hey, do you want some coffee?

17:23.175 --> 17:25.108
Yeah, thanks.

17:25.111 --> 17:27.078
Hey, I'm sorry about last night.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.152
Sweetie,

17:35.955 --> 17:38.923
I know he's like,
really hard to deal with,

17:39.459 --> 17:41.059
but you really have to

17:41.061 --> 17:43.394
get a grip on your anger, okay?

17:43.396 --> 17:44.929
Yeah, I know. It's just...

17:46.900 --> 17:48.833
He just triggers
something in me.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.436
- Yeah.
- I feel like shit.

17:51.438 --> 17:52.703
You know what?

17:52.705 --> 17:55.373
We can start meditating
together if you want.

17:55.608 --> 17:56.674
Yeah.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.776
Do you wanna see
what he did, though?

17:58.778 --> 18:00.878
I mean, I don't...

18:01.281 --> 18:02.513
Oh, boy.

18:06.386 --> 18:07.518
Oh, my god.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.225
It's...

18:17.597 --> 18:19.197
Oh, look at your face, though.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.632
- When you see him...
- It's not funny.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.234
- It's funny.
- No.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.368
It's pretty funny.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.404
It's pretty hot.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.210
Are you...

18:32.212 --> 18:33.111
What do you mean?

18:33.113 --> 18:34.979
Are you like, turned on by it?

18:34.981 --> 18:36.180
Yeah.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.916
Is that weird?

18:40.053 --> 18:43.521
Well, look.
Look, you know how

18:43.523 --> 18:45.456
sometimes I feel disconnected.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.593
I mean, you have me
right here, can't you just...

18:49.796 --> 18:52.330
Like, connect with me

18:52.332 --> 18:54.065
and just be here with me,

18:54.067 --> 18:55.900
and just like, delete that?

18:55.902 --> 18:58.936
It's kinda like,
porn. Porny.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.339
I guess we haven't really
had this conversation.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.607
I'm like,

19:02.609 --> 19:03.875
very against it.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.576
- Obviously, yeah.
- Yeah.

19:05.578 --> 19:06.844
- Porn.
- Yes.

19:06.846 --> 19:07.979
Because, you know,

19:07.981 --> 19:09.881
these women are
really being exploited.

19:09.883 --> 19:11.849
I read a whole thing about,

19:11.851 --> 19:14.552
you know, the rise
of like, super exploitative,

19:14.554 --> 19:16.220
like violent porn.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.523
That's like, what,
men wanna watch now?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.024
It's like, so weird to me.

19:20.026 --> 19:21.692
Babe, I don't
wanna watch any of that.

19:21.694 --> 19:22.994
I don't wanna watch any of that.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.395
I just wanna watch you and me.

19:26.933 --> 19:28.499
- Want me to delete it?
- Get rid of it.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.767
Yeah, just delete it.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.736
Yeah, okay.

19:31.738 --> 19:32.904
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.305
That would be good.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.681
So, so far,
this one's been a lot better,

19:43.683 --> 19:46.117
because on my last birthday,
we were serving tacos, right?

19:46.119 --> 19:48.419
And Todd, my other uncle,

19:48.421 --> 19:51.255
bet Shonzi that
he could eat 30 tacos,

19:51.257 --> 19:52.156
and he did.

19:52.158 --> 19:53.624
And then he threw up everywhere.

19:53.626 --> 19:54.992
Like, honestly, like everywhere.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.561
Like, in the pool,

19:56.563 --> 19:58.663
yeah, it was really disgusting,

19:58.665 --> 19:59.597
and it was a disaster,

19:59.599 --> 20:00.998
and everybody left,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.767
and I was all alone
on my birthday.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.702
Get your hands off her.

20:09.943 --> 20:12.443
- Just ignore him.
- Hm.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.245
All right, you asked for it.

20:14.747 --> 20:15.880
Cannonball!

20:17.450 --> 20:18.382
Mom!

20:18.384 --> 20:20.618
Shonzi, don't.
That's enough, all right?

20:20.620 --> 20:21.986
Hey, guys!

20:21.988 --> 20:23.854
Hey. Oh yeah, good.
You made it.

20:23.856 --> 20:24.855
Hello.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.357
Shonzi, you got me all wet.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.926
Gross. Isn't that
your boyfriend's job?

20:28.928 --> 20:30.962
Ew! Shut up.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.463
No, you shut up.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.965
Wow. That's a big present.

20:33.967 --> 20:34.999
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.934
I can't stay too long.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.369
Okay, well...

20:38.371 --> 20:40.304
Oh, my gosh. Gotta
get you drinking, then.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.772
I gotta go check the grill, too.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.007
Okay.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.009
Dude, where's Lindsay?

20:45.778 --> 20:47.144
She's not here.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.014
Okay.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.022
Any luck?

21:00.593 --> 21:01.959
Sorry, I...

21:01.961 --> 21:03.728
He knows we have
a parking garage, right?

21:03.730 --> 21:05.429
Mm-hm, yeah.

21:08.668 --> 21:10.434
He, oh, here...

21:17.577 --> 21:19.443
Just open.

21:19.445 --> 21:21.545
Hey, what's up?
Whole gang's here.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.714
Um, you guys are underdressed.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.916
I figured I'd
get out of this marriage

21:25.918 --> 21:26.951
the way I came in.

21:26.953 --> 21:28.486
Just like, on fleek.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.754
And a little bit tipsy.

21:29.756 --> 21:32.189
Yeah, you're
really late, you know?

21:32.191 --> 21:33.224
Oh, yeah.

21:33.226 --> 21:35.159
I apologize if I'm not
as eager as you are.

21:35.161 --> 21:36.627
So...

21:36.629 --> 21:38.996
I was hoping that, you and me,

21:38.998 --> 21:41.132
could have a word in privacy

21:41.134 --> 21:44.068
before we commence
the negotiations.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.169
- I think we should...
- Yeah.

21:45.171 --> 21:46.304
We'll give you that.

21:46.306 --> 21:48.005
- Great.
- Yeah, let's...

21:48.007 --> 21:50.641
- Bye.
- Yeah.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.344
So, before I sign that shit, um,

21:53.346 --> 21:54.679
you know,

21:54.681 --> 21:56.247
I need you to do something.

21:57.583 --> 21:58.616
Okay.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.218
Okay, what do you need?

22:03.122 --> 22:05.022
I wanna hear you say it.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.727
Say what?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.495
That you fucking cheated on me.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.564
Are you...

22:15.835 --> 22:18.002
This is ridiculous, okay?

22:18.004 --> 22:19.904
You had your
little secrets, too.

22:19.906 --> 22:20.971
Hm, okay.

22:20.973 --> 22:23.474
I, we both,
had fuck-ups,

22:23.476 --> 22:25.443
but I stuck in.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.911
You're the one that's leaving.

22:26.913 --> 22:28.012
What?

22:28.014 --> 22:29.413
You stuck in?

22:29.415 --> 22:31.082
You have this whole story
that you're perfect,

22:31.084 --> 22:33.150
and I fucked the whole thing up.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.086
You fucked part
of this up, okay?

22:35.088 --> 22:36.454
I'm not going to play games.

22:36.456 --> 22:37.822
I'm not going to play games, no.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.123
Okay, fine.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.458
All right, well then, I guess,

22:40.460 --> 22:41.826
I'm not gonna sign the papers.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.060
Adam...

22:43.629 --> 22:45.763
Don't be crazy.

22:46.265 --> 22:47.565
Say it.

22:47.567 --> 22:49.433
Why does it matter?
Why does it matter?

22:49.435 --> 22:52.236
We're just getting...
We're gonna sign the papers...

22:52.238 --> 22:54.271
Because you don't get
to be right all the time.

22:55.508 --> 22:56.640
You can't do it.

22:56.642 --> 22:58.275
I am not going to.

22:58.644 --> 23:01.245
You can't do it.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.388
Hm, right.

23:11.023 --> 23:13.290
But was it easy to move on?

23:13.292 --> 23:15.860
The first girlfriend
after divorce

23:15.862 --> 23:17.061
is kind of a big deal.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.562
I don't care as
I don't want to be with him.

23:18.564 --> 23:20.064
I'm glad I'm not married to him.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.533
Still, it was like,
"hm, he's got a girlfriend."

23:22.535 --> 23:24.902
You ever fee like
you wanna get back?

23:26.439 --> 23:27.905
Oh, my god, no.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.372
Hey, Lily, Jake.
You want a burger?

23:29.942 --> 23:31.175
Get over here.

23:31.511 --> 23:32.610
Hey, bro.

23:32.612 --> 23:33.744
Come here.

23:37.884 --> 23:38.884
Check it out.

23:39.485 --> 23:40.618
It's Lily.

23:42.455 --> 23:44.221
Dude, that's our fucking niece.

23:44.223 --> 23:45.756
So? She's hot.

23:47.059 --> 23:48.359
You're a pervert.

23:49.662 --> 23:51.362
I'm kidding, bro.

23:51.364 --> 23:54.398
Here you go. I gotta go
pick up Lindsay.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.233
Oh, you gotta go
pick up your girlfriend?

23:56.235 --> 23:58.536
- Yeah.
- Are you pussy-whipped?

24:01.140 --> 24:03.140
- Bye.
- Shonzi...

24:10.950 --> 24:13.284
- Is that your boyfriend?
- No.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.986
- Who is it, then?
- I called an Uber.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.388
Okay? So...

24:22.161 --> 24:24.562
Hi. I'll just...

24:32.872 --> 24:34.171
What's up, man?

24:34.841 --> 24:35.873
Hey.

24:50.523 --> 24:53.591
Hi, my name is Todd.
I'll be your Uber driver.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.060
I'm sorry.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.728
I'm really sorry.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.731
I just didn't wanna
complicate things.

25:00.733 --> 25:02.132
I didn't know how to...

25:02.134 --> 25:03.834
I get it. It's fine.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.704
So, what happened?

25:07.773 --> 25:09.907
Oh, he's contesting it.

25:09.909 --> 25:10.975
Why?

25:10.977 --> 25:13.544
Just to be an asshole.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.447
I mean, it's gonna happen.

25:17.416 --> 25:19.783
He just wants to
punish me for it.

25:20.553 --> 25:22.019
I'm sorry, babe.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.254
Thanks.

25:25.491 --> 25:26.690
If you're gonna touch me,

25:26.692 --> 25:29.960
I should probably
report you to the company.

25:29.962 --> 25:31.061
Oh, please don't.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.930
I already have only three stars.

25:32.932 --> 25:33.998
Oh.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.867
I touch all my passengers.

25:49.315 --> 25:50.948
Do you feel okay?

25:51.651 --> 25:52.816
Yeah.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.975
Do you want me to
flip over again or something?

26:17.977 --> 26:18.943
No.

26:18.945 --> 26:20.744
I don't think I can finish.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.882
Really? Are you sure?

26:24.884 --> 26:26.116
Yeah.

26:26.118 --> 26:27.451
I'm sorry, I just...

26:27.453 --> 26:29.353
I think I wanna go
to the bathroom.

26:29.989 --> 26:31.021
Okay.

26:31.757 --> 26:32.823
Thanks.

26:38.364 --> 26:39.697
Todd.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.099
I know you're angry at me,

26:42.101 --> 26:43.901
but please call me back

26:43.903 --> 26:46.804
'cause I have a really
cool idea for the film.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.372
All right, I'm thinking

26:48.374 --> 26:51.609
your character
wasn't really dead,

26:51.611 --> 26:52.610
and then maybe

26:52.612 --> 26:55.379
you end up with
Lindsay's character.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.015
All right, would that
make you happy?

26:58.017 --> 27:00.084
This is Shonzi, call me back.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.419
Hey.

27:02.421 --> 27:04.388
What did I tell you
about knocking?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.156
I thought you were gonna
help me with that thing.

27:06.158 --> 27:08.392
Dad, I quit, okay?

27:08.394 --> 27:09.627
You quit. All right.

27:09.629 --> 27:11.428
Then you quit
your allowance, too.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.563
I don't care.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.298
I'm gonna be
a famous film maker.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.066
Don't hold your breath.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.102
You better be nice
to me, all right?

27:18.104 --> 27:19.837
Because when I'm
rich and famous,

27:19.839 --> 27:22.039
and I got all these
girls around me,

27:22.041 --> 27:23.607
you know, like, at the premiere,

27:23.609 --> 27:25.542
I'm gonna have, like,
three of them on me,

27:25.544 --> 27:28.212
I can't make out
with everyone at once.

27:28.214 --> 27:29.947
So, if you're nice,

27:29.949 --> 27:31.382
maybe I'll give you one.

27:31.384 --> 27:33.317
Five minutes, all right?
Outside.

27:33.319 --> 27:36.286
I'm not working for you.

27:36.288 --> 27:37.655
Yes, you are.

28:04.583 --> 28:05.716
Come on.

28:07.253 --> 28:08.619
Come on.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.921
Come on, pizza.

28:10.923 --> 28:12.389
Hi, Justine.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.425
Hi, Lindsay.
How are you?

28:14.427 --> 28:16.360
Good! How's pizza doing?

28:16.362 --> 28:17.494
Pretty good.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.763
I just got her a new wheelchair.

28:19.765 --> 28:20.764
Yeah.

28:20.766 --> 28:21.832
It's kinda rough,

28:21.834 --> 28:24.034
but I think it's gonna be
really good in the end.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.149
Hey, sorry,
I just need to get...

28:39.151 --> 28:40.417
Um...

28:43.823 --> 28:44.888
Um...

28:47.026 --> 28:48.459
Are you masturbating?

28:49.862 --> 28:50.961
Yeah.

28:52.531 --> 28:54.164
Seeing if it still works.

28:56.635 --> 28:58.135
What are you looking at?

29:00.740 --> 29:01.839
This...

29:04.176 --> 29:06.043
Just, come on.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.146
This is just...

29:09.148 --> 29:11.048
Oh, god!

29:12.318 --> 29:14.017
I thought you deleted that.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.719
It's, um...

29:16.856 --> 29:18.155
It's on the cloud.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.925
I mean, we just
talked about this.

29:21.927 --> 29:23.527
I thought you understood

29:24.029 --> 29:25.529
what that meant to me.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.903
On the cloud?

29:37.009 --> 29:38.609
Dig a hole that end.

29:39.211 --> 29:40.944
Not unless you apologize.

29:41.514 --> 29:43.213
Apologize for what?

29:43.215 --> 29:45.215
For treating me like an idiot.

29:45.217 --> 29:47.284
Are you gonna help me here?

29:47.286 --> 29:48.886
Or are you not?

29:48.888 --> 29:49.920
Not.

29:50.656 --> 29:53.457
Jesus fucking Christ...

29:57.530 --> 29:59.096
You're gonna hurt yourself.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.365
Call 911.

30:01.367 --> 30:04.101
No, not unless you apologize.

30:05.604 --> 30:06.604
Dad.

30:08.207 --> 30:09.506
Dad.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.375
Jesus Christ.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.610
All right. Let me
get my phone.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.518
Hi, Todd. It's Nina again.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.688
So, um, dad is stable.

30:24.690 --> 30:26.790
Do you mind
if I just check your iv again?

30:26.792 --> 30:29.293
Uh, yeah.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.595
Does that hurt?
Does it feel okay?

30:31.597 --> 30:33.197
Yeah, yeah.
I'm all right.

30:35.467 --> 30:36.700
Hey.

30:37.269 --> 30:38.569
What's up?

30:39.171 --> 30:40.504
Not much.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.105
What's your name?

30:43.175 --> 30:44.608
Sam.

30:45.110 --> 30:46.977
Cool. Very cool.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.214
You know, I noticed

30:50.216 --> 30:51.315
you got some...

30:51.317 --> 30:52.816
I really like your nails.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.718
Oh, thanks.
I just got them done.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.253
Yeah, they're really cool.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.021
I was just gonna say that.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.360
What the hell was that?

31:03.362 --> 31:06.063
I just told her
her nails were cool.

31:06.065 --> 31:07.531
Yeah. Well, you interrupted.

31:07.533 --> 31:09.800
Shaun, please.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.035
Shut the fuck up.

31:13.906 --> 31:14.805
Okay.

31:14.807 --> 31:17.007
Dad, it's not all about you.

31:19.511 --> 31:21.478
I was just
leaving you a message.

31:21.480 --> 31:24.147
- Sorry.
- It's all right. Hey.

31:24.149 --> 31:26.450
- Hi. Lindsay.
- Hey.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.252
Uh, how is he?

31:28.254 --> 31:30.020
He's okay.
He's stable...

31:30.022 --> 31:32.756
Well, well, well.
Look what the cat dragged in.

31:32.758 --> 31:34.291
Shh, okay?

31:34.293 --> 31:35.759
Keep your voice down, okay?

31:35.761 --> 31:38.295
You know, I do about
100 push-ups a day.

31:38.831 --> 31:40.130
Oh.

31:40.132 --> 31:41.298
Wanna feel it?

31:41.300 --> 31:42.366
No.

31:42.368 --> 31:43.533
Oh,

31:43.535 --> 31:45.302
so what are we
gonna do with him?

31:45.304 --> 31:46.536
Oh god, Shonzi.

31:46.538 --> 31:47.971
Um, I'm super-crazed
right now,

31:47.973 --> 31:49.339
with kids and work
and everything,

31:49.341 --> 31:51.041
I cannot right now.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.276
Could you take him?

31:52.278 --> 31:54.211
Um. Well...

31:55.814 --> 31:57.114
Mm-hm.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.382
Yeah.

31:58.384 --> 32:00.350
Thank you so much.

32:00.352 --> 32:01.718
Why would I
go over to your house

32:01.720 --> 32:02.719
if you don't want me there?

32:02.721 --> 32:04.354
Hey. We want you there.

32:04.356 --> 32:07.224
We were just talking about
inviting you over, anyway.

32:07.226 --> 32:08.659
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

32:08.661 --> 32:09.993
Why didn't you
call me back, then?

32:09.995 --> 32:12.596
'Cause we were trying
to figure out which day

32:12.598 --> 32:14.731
would be best to have you over.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.466
Right, babe?

32:16.468 --> 32:17.601
Remember?

32:17.603 --> 32:19.870
Lindsay, is that true?

32:21.173 --> 32:23.540
Actually, um, Shonzi,

32:23.542 --> 32:26.810
Todd is still upset
about what happened.

32:26.812 --> 32:28.278
And I understand
him being upset...

32:28.280 --> 32:31.581
I mean, it doesn't
excuse the fact that he

32:31.583 --> 32:32.950
hit you...

32:32.952 --> 32:35.218
But we should talk about
the fact that you're upset.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.453
Why are you upset?

32:36.455 --> 32:38.188
You are the one who hit me.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.656
I don't know, maybe because

32:39.658 --> 32:42.359
you were trying to
videotape us having sex.

32:42.361 --> 32:43.627
I'm sorry, all right?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.562
Can we just
get over this, already?

32:45.564 --> 32:47.597
Wow. Great apology, buddy.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.499
I really felt that one.

32:49.501 --> 32:52.469
You know what?
I don't need this shit.

32:52.471 --> 32:53.837
Tell me when you're gone.

32:53.839 --> 32:54.905
Dude...

32:57.176 --> 32:58.642
Dude. Hey, dude.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.644
Hey, I'm sorry

33:00.646 --> 33:01.812
I hit you.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.146
I was just trying to help you.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.382
I know you were just
trying to help.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.550
I was in the wrong.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.552
You were acting like a maniac.

33:08.554 --> 33:09.820
I'm sorry.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.588
What's up with you?

33:11.590 --> 33:13.423
I was gonna give you the video.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.992
- I know.
- Okay?

33:14.994 --> 33:16.727
I'm, I'm...

33:16.729 --> 33:20.130
I've been agitated lately, okay?

33:20.132 --> 33:21.164
So what's the problem?

33:21.166 --> 33:22.666
I don't know, I think
I'm just depressed.

33:22.668 --> 33:24.634
Or stressed out, I don't know.

33:24.636 --> 33:27.104
Talk to me, okay?
I'm your brother.

33:28.340 --> 33:29.740
You got a big mouth.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.809
All right, I will...

33:32.811 --> 33:34.845
- Keep your mouth shut?
- Yes.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.980
I promise I won't say anything.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.083
Okay.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.220
I'm having
a hard time finishing.

33:44.556 --> 33:45.789
During sex.

33:46.492 --> 33:47.724
Yeah.

33:48.193 --> 33:50.027
I can't finish.

33:50.029 --> 33:52.596
- Okay. I'm coming over.
- Good.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.798
We can get
to the bottom of this.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.233
- All right?
- Okay, just...

33:57.036 --> 33:58.535
Just don't do anything weird.

33:58.537 --> 34:00.570
I'm not, all right?

34:00.572 --> 34:01.905
Can you say it?

34:01.907 --> 34:04.474
Say it, "I'm not
gonna do anything weird."

34:04.476 --> 34:06.109
I'm not gonna do anything weird.

34:06.812 --> 34:09.045
- I promise.
- Promise? Okay.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.714
We're back!

34:12.016 --> 34:13.784
Put your tongue
back in your mouth.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.219
Why?

34:39.645 --> 34:41.344
She's got your food
coming right now.

34:41.346 --> 34:42.579
Seconds.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.380
- Thank you.
- There you go.

34:44.382 --> 34:45.949
Aha!

34:49.655 --> 34:51.188
Wow.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.690
This is literally
the finest cuisine

34:53.692 --> 34:57.127
I've ever eaten.

34:57.796 --> 34:58.862
Thank you, Shonzi.

34:58.864 --> 35:01.731
Whoa. Todd is a lucky guy.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.867
Oh, well, he's not
so bad himself.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.802
Well, I, for one,

35:05.804 --> 35:07.737
cannot wait to go back
and see dad.

35:07.739 --> 35:08.939
Are you worried about him?

35:08.941 --> 35:11.875
Yeah, but I want to
talk to that nurse.

35:11.877 --> 35:13.310
She was pretty into me.

35:13.312 --> 35:15.745
I'm not so sure she was.

35:15.747 --> 35:17.647
She kept playing with her hair

35:17.649 --> 35:18.715
when I was talking to her.

35:18.717 --> 35:20.417
Sort of like, fidgeting.

35:20.419 --> 35:21.685
- Body language.
- Right.

35:21.687 --> 35:23.086
- Mm-hm.
- Body language.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.421
It's a subconscious thing.

35:24.423 --> 35:25.989
But the thing is, um,

35:25.991 --> 35:28.725
you know, sometimes,
I play with my hair,

35:28.727 --> 35:30.660
I do stuff like this,

35:30.662 --> 35:32.262
but it's just to get it
out of my face.

35:32.264 --> 35:33.763
Well, no. The...

35:33.765 --> 35:35.065
The night we first kissed,

35:35.067 --> 35:37.834
I knew something was
gonna happen with us, because,

35:38.504 --> 35:39.703
you kept playing with your hair.

35:39.705 --> 35:40.804
- What?
- Oh...

35:40.806 --> 35:42.172
No.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.407
Maybe I'm wrong,
but I don't think I am.

35:45.010 --> 35:46.510
Don't you guys see?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.745
Like a woman is not even free

35:48.747 --> 35:50.380
to touch her hair

35:50.382 --> 35:53.350
without it being interpreted
as some sexual thing

35:53.352 --> 35:54.518
by a man.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.719
That's like, depressing.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.889
You seem tense, Lindsay.

35:58.891 --> 36:01.158
You want me
to give you a back rub?

36:01.527 --> 36:03.193
Okay.

36:03.195 --> 36:05.862
That's really sweet of you
to offer that.

36:05.864 --> 36:09.266
But, I think,
after what happened,

36:09.268 --> 36:11.101
it's better to have
some boundaries.

36:11.103 --> 36:13.003
You know, I don't think
it's appropriate.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.137
How are we gonna get past this

36:14.139 --> 36:15.372
if you guys don't trust me?

36:15.374 --> 36:17.774
Hey, see what happens
if you touch her, dude,

36:17.776 --> 36:19.442
I dare you. Go ahead.

36:19.444 --> 36:22.646
Oh, okay, I guess I'll
make her slow then, right?

36:22.648 --> 36:25.148
It's not like cooties, okay?

36:35.060 --> 36:36.626
You know what, Shonzi?

36:38.163 --> 36:40.864
I think that if you
can give me a back rub

36:40.866 --> 36:42.832
as a friend,

36:42.834 --> 36:44.601
that would be
a really good step.

36:44.603 --> 36:45.602
That's all I need.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.237
Are you serious right now?

36:48.373 --> 36:50.807
- Yeah.
- -Wait...

36:50.809 --> 36:52.976
- He's just a friend.
- -Just relax, bro.

36:58.317 --> 36:59.816
How's that?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.418
Oh, it's good.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.053
Yeah.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.422
Oh.

37:06.758 --> 37:07.791
How's that?

37:07.793 --> 37:08.858
It's really good.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.161
Take a deep breath in.

37:14.733 --> 37:16.700
Nice, how's that?

37:16.702 --> 37:19.169
It's good, oh yeah.
Oh, gosh.

37:19.171 --> 37:21.071
This is just the ending.

37:21.073 --> 37:22.205
It's just the ending.

37:22.207 --> 37:23.673
All right, well, you know what?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.208
I think that's great.

37:25.210 --> 37:28.278
And I'm gonna clear the plates.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.847
Um, that was a
really good first step.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.049
See? That
wasn't inappropriate.

37:33.051 --> 37:34.117
No.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.355
Thanks.

37:40.459 --> 37:41.591
Bye.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.926
Bye.

37:43.395 --> 37:44.561
What are you doing?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.264
I'm warming her up for you.

37:47.666 --> 37:48.932
For what?

37:48.934 --> 37:51.034
- So you can take a video.
- I'm not... hey...

37:51.036 --> 37:52.235
Or, okay, photos.

37:52.237 --> 37:55.138
- Start out with photos.
- No.

37:55.140 --> 37:57.741
None of it.
She's not into that, okay?

37:57.743 --> 37:59.609
You want me
to bring up those videos

37:59.611 --> 38:00.910
that you did with Lucy?

38:00.912 --> 38:04.414
No. I don't want you
to bring that up.

38:04.416 --> 38:07.150
I mean, don't you think
I wish she was into that?

38:07.152 --> 38:09.152
I do, okay? But she's not.

38:09.154 --> 38:11.521
Look, if you don't bring
it up, then I will.

38:11.523 --> 38:12.756
Let's just let this go.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.391
Maybe I should
tell her right now.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.226
- Don't, please don't...
- Oh, Lindsay!

38:16.228 --> 38:18.128
- We have something to tell you.
- Okay.

38:21.733 --> 38:23.199
- Okay?
- Okay.

38:30.575 --> 38:32.108
It's for your own good.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.403
Are you pissed?

39:02.107 --> 39:04.207
Look, I know you mean well,

39:04.843 --> 39:05.975
but I'm just gonna take him

39:05.977 --> 39:07.644
to work with me tomorrow, okay?

39:09.247 --> 39:10.280
You...

39:11.283 --> 39:12.749
I just think

39:12.751 --> 39:15.518
that the more he is
around a woman,

39:15.520 --> 39:17.020
and gets to know her,

39:17.022 --> 39:18.621
the more chance there is

39:18.623 --> 39:20.690
that he'll stop treating her

39:20.692 --> 39:22.325
like a sexual object.

39:22.327 --> 39:24.561
You have to be careful with him.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.229
He doesn't get your whole

39:26.231 --> 39:27.964
super open, new age-y thing.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.966
He just sees a pretty girl

39:29.968 --> 39:31.234
giving him attention,

39:31.236 --> 39:33.069
and then it turns him on.

39:33.972 --> 39:35.372
You don't trust me?

39:36.508 --> 39:38.108
I don't trust him.

39:39.411 --> 39:40.677
He's very lonely.

39:40.679 --> 39:42.479
He's very lonely right now,

39:42.481 --> 39:45.281
and you are not being
super friendly to him.

39:46.118 --> 39:47.450
Yeah, I know.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.653
So I should take him
to work with me.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.189
Right?

39:53.191 --> 39:54.791
Are you gonna be nice to him?

39:54.793 --> 39:56.259
Yeah, of course.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.532
Okay.

40:04.903 --> 40:08.071
Hey, I've been meaning to, uh...

40:09.341 --> 40:10.707
Yeah?

40:10.709 --> 40:12.776
I just, I wanted to...

40:12.778 --> 40:15.311
I just want to say sorry

40:15.881 --> 40:19.082
about the whole video thing,

40:19.084 --> 40:22.152
and I understand that
you are not into that.

40:22.154 --> 40:25.221
And that, that was
very disrespectful

40:25.223 --> 40:27.824
to you and your beliefs.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.559
The main thing
I had an issue with

40:29.561 --> 40:31.094
was the secrecy,

40:31.096 --> 40:32.495
that everything was so secret.

40:32.497 --> 40:36.032
I mean, you know how much
I hated that with Adam,

40:36.034 --> 40:37.300
- just the lying, and...
- I know.

40:37.302 --> 40:39.803
- I can't do it again.
- I know, I know, I know.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.204
And I don't want that.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.406
I don't want that for us.

40:43.408 --> 40:46.509
I guess I just...

40:47.078 --> 40:48.678
Just couldn't resist.

40:49.281 --> 40:50.814
I couldn't resist.

40:53.685 --> 40:55.051
Yeah, well, I couldn't.

40:55.053 --> 40:56.419
Well, okay.

41:00.926 --> 41:04.027
Do you want
to take a photo of me...

41:04.029 --> 41:05.862
Do you want to take
a photo of me right now?

41:08.533 --> 41:10.033
Babe, really?

41:10.035 --> 41:11.167
Yeah.

41:12.070 --> 41:13.703
I think it could be sexy.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.141
If you want to.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.776
- Right now?
- Yeah.

41:22.514 --> 41:24.848
I mean, you do want to, right?

41:24.850 --> 41:25.882
Yeah...

41:26.351 --> 41:27.450
Yes.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.719
- Yes.
- Yeah?

41:29.721 --> 41:30.687
I'd love to.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.422
I think it could be fun.

41:33.758 --> 41:34.958
Okay.

41:54.546 --> 41:56.212
- I don't know.
- This is amazing.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.514
Do I do this?

42:06.157 --> 42:07.423
Hey!

42:10.061 --> 42:11.494
What are you doing?

42:13.398 --> 42:16.099
Hey, kinda have to be
quiet right now.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.934
Oh, okay.

42:17.936 --> 42:19.969
- Why?
- Um...

42:19.971 --> 42:21.571
It's a secret.

42:21.573 --> 42:22.639
Oh, I love secrets.

42:22.641 --> 42:25.208
Is it a surprise
for Todd and Lindsay?

42:25.210 --> 42:27.810
Ah, yeah.
You could say that.

42:27.812 --> 42:28.978
Oh!

42:28.980 --> 42:30.179
He's my brother.

42:30.181 --> 42:32.181
It's like a whole
project we're doing,

42:32.183 --> 42:34.384
and so I can't really...

42:34.386 --> 42:37.320
I live next door.
I'm Justine.

42:37.322 --> 42:38.321
What's your name?

42:38.323 --> 42:41.024
Do you want to
hang out sometime?

42:41.026 --> 42:42.992
Like, what do you mean?

42:42.994 --> 42:44.827
Do you want to
hang out sometime?

42:44.829 --> 42:45.995
What, you and me?

42:45.997 --> 42:47.463
Yeah.

42:47.465 --> 42:49.899
I would love to,

42:49.901 --> 42:51.734
but I have a girlfriend.

42:52.437 --> 42:55.305
Her name's Cindy Crawford.

43:32.043 --> 43:33.343
Hey.

43:42.387 --> 43:45.388
I want him to
stick his penis in this jar

43:45.390 --> 43:48.324
and try to come from just
the flapping of the wings

43:48.326 --> 43:49.892
on the tip of his dick.

43:49.894 --> 43:51.294
Do you think you could do that?

44:00.472 --> 44:01.671
Stop it!

44:03.108 --> 44:05.108
Stop! You're hurting her.

44:05.110 --> 44:06.609
Why did you kill dad?

44:15.754 --> 44:16.953
You gotta save her.

44:16.955 --> 44:19.122
By the flesh, must be free.

44:19.124 --> 44:20.223
No!

44:26.931 --> 44:29.298
Hey. Wake up.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.668
Wake up.
What are you doing?

44:33.071 --> 44:34.370
Just get dressed.

44:34.372 --> 44:36.072
Shonzi, just put this on.

44:36.074 --> 44:37.540
This looks fine.

44:37.542 --> 44:39.142
Hurry up,
she's got this big plan

44:39.144 --> 44:40.877
to hang out with you today.

44:40.879 --> 44:42.945
That's what she said?

44:42.947 --> 44:45.381
Yeah. Yeah, so let's go.

44:47.652 --> 44:50.720
Okay, I think I see
what's happening here.

44:50.722 --> 44:52.588
You're scared to
leave me alone with her.

44:52.590 --> 44:54.590
Right? You think she's
gonna get sweet on me?

44:54.592 --> 44:56.426
Actually, I don't think
you're her type.

44:56.428 --> 44:58.394
You think you're
gonna go to work,

44:58.396 --> 45:01.664
and then I'll be at home,
working your girlfriend.

45:04.436 --> 45:05.668
Dude, that won't happen,

45:05.670 --> 45:08.237
'cause you're a
fucking retard, okay?

45:08.239 --> 45:09.539
What'd you call me?

45:10.108 --> 45:11.374
Hey.

45:12.944 --> 45:14.410
Oh, hey, Lindsay.

45:14.412 --> 45:15.945
What's going on?

45:15.947 --> 45:18.047
Nothing.

45:18.049 --> 45:19.782
Todd just called me a retard.

45:19.784 --> 45:22.285
You were pushing
my buttons, buddy.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.087
He was pushing my buttons.

45:24.923 --> 45:26.489
Can you just apologize?

45:27.826 --> 45:29.192
Yeah.

45:29.194 --> 45:30.526
Hey man, I'm sorry.

45:30.528 --> 45:32.361
I shouldn't have
called you that.

45:32.363 --> 45:34.497
But I don't like it when you...

45:34.499 --> 45:37.200
Say dirty jokes about
my girlfriend, okay?

45:37.202 --> 45:39.869
Okay. Well...

45:39.871 --> 45:42.305
I mean, if that's all,
you have to say.

45:42.307 --> 45:44.540
I'm pretty sure I did,
like a million times.

45:44.542 --> 45:46.075
- It's just... okay.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.376
He's trying, Todd,

45:47.378 --> 45:50.079
and I think he
has a point, you know?

45:50.081 --> 45:51.280
Just say it.

45:51.282 --> 45:53.149
- You know?
- Yeah.

45:53.151 --> 45:54.817
We can talk about this later.

45:54.819 --> 45:56.352
Uh, we gotta go.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.554
- Great.
- So get your shoes on, okay?

45:59.724 --> 46:01.457
Shonzi, um...

46:01.459 --> 46:03.493
Do you wanna just
stay here today?

46:03.495 --> 46:05.128
- Yeah.
- -No, no.

46:05.130 --> 46:07.096
You said you wanted
to come with me.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.397
You said you wanted

46:08.399 --> 46:09.799
to go to work with me, right?

46:13.204 --> 46:14.771
You know what
I think is happening?

46:14.773 --> 46:15.638
What?

46:15.640 --> 46:16.906
I think he's
a little freaked out

46:16.908 --> 46:18.574
- 'cause he's in a new place,
- okay.

46:18.576 --> 46:21.978
And I think you're probably
scared about your dad, right?

46:21.980 --> 46:23.513
- Yeah.
- -Yeah.

46:23.515 --> 46:25.081
So just hang out with me,

46:25.083 --> 46:26.649
we'll do something fun.

46:27.185 --> 46:28.618
It's gonna be nice.

46:28.620 --> 46:29.652
Cool.

46:29.988 --> 46:31.120
Cool.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.221
Cool.

46:32.223 --> 46:33.689
You guys,

46:33.691 --> 46:36.092
if you need anything,
just give me a call.

46:36.094 --> 46:38.060
Okay.

46:38.062 --> 46:39.896
We'll be fine, bro.

46:39.898 --> 46:40.930
Mm-hm.

46:50.775 --> 46:52.308
And I just wanted to show you

46:52.310 --> 46:54.811
all my little crystals.

46:54.813 --> 46:55.978
I like that one.

46:55.980 --> 46:57.146
You like that one?

46:58.116 --> 46:59.482
Yeah.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.017
Looks cool, right?

47:02.220 --> 47:04.253
That one is for protection,

47:04.255 --> 47:06.856
and for divine connection.

47:06.858 --> 47:08.724
Does it make you feel
kinda safe?

47:08.726 --> 47:09.892
Powerful.

47:09.894 --> 47:11.494
Powerful, good.

47:11.896 --> 47:13.062
Like, um...

47:13.798 --> 47:15.464
Like in a cave.

47:16.100 --> 47:17.300
Yeah, exactly.

47:17.302 --> 47:18.601
But my cave.

47:20.705 --> 47:21.838
And...

47:22.640 --> 47:24.440
Just staying by myself,

47:24.442 --> 47:26.008
but I'm not lonely.

47:30.048 --> 47:31.581
I really love that.

47:31.583 --> 47:33.049
I really love that.

47:33.051 --> 47:34.217
You know what?

47:35.286 --> 47:36.552
This is for you.

47:36.554 --> 47:38.087
I want you to keep that.

47:39.290 --> 47:41.824
And, this one here,

47:41.826 --> 47:43.392
I think will be good for you.

47:43.394 --> 47:45.962
It is frankincense oil

47:45.964 --> 47:50.600
and it is really good
for depression and heartbreak

47:50.602 --> 47:51.601
and things like that.

47:51.603 --> 47:53.202
Put your wrist out.

47:53.204 --> 47:54.470
Now give me your hand.

47:54.472 --> 47:57.139
It's very calming.
You feel calm?

47:57.141 --> 47:58.608
Yeah.

47:58.610 --> 48:00.543
Well, I don't know about calm,

48:00.545 --> 48:02.612
but, well, like...

48:03.581 --> 48:05.581
- Whoa.
- Yeah?

48:05.583 --> 48:07.083
That's good.

48:07.085 --> 48:09.185
You feel kind of energized.

48:09.187 --> 48:10.419
Mm-hm.

48:10.421 --> 48:13.189
Also, Shonzi, can I show you
this video I made?

48:13.191 --> 48:14.891
Uh, yeah.

48:15.293 --> 48:16.692
Look at this.

48:20.999 --> 48:22.765
And that guy
is just following her?

48:22.767 --> 48:26.235
Yeah, look, he follows her
down the street,

48:27.071 --> 48:29.205
for literally 30 minutes.

48:30.341 --> 48:31.641
- What?
- -Yeah.

48:31.643 --> 48:34.110
Just like shouting things
and saying things.

48:34.112 --> 48:35.678
That should be against the law.

48:35.680 --> 48:38.281
I mean, if someone was
following you around like that,

48:38.283 --> 48:39.782
I'd pop him in the face.

48:40.485 --> 48:42.118
Thank you, Shonzi.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.486
I mean, I'd rip his arm off.

48:43.488 --> 48:44.687
I'd be like, "uh..."

48:44.689 --> 48:46.589
- "What are you doing, bro?"
- Yeah.

48:46.591 --> 48:47.957
- "How do you like that?"
- Yeah.

48:47.959 --> 48:49.558
Because you know
that it is wrong.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.661
Yeah, I mean, she's just...

48:51.663 --> 48:53.796
"Get out of my way."

48:53.998 --> 48:55.631
Exactly.

48:55.633 --> 48:57.967
You know what I think
this video is missing?

48:59.037 --> 49:00.903
A man's perspective.

49:00.905 --> 49:02.138
- Hm.
- Yeah.

49:02.340 --> 49:03.673
Yeah.

49:04.409 --> 49:05.808
Do you wanna help me?

49:06.477 --> 49:08.377
- Do a mic check.
- Oh, okay.

49:08.379 --> 49:10.479
- Check.
- Ow.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.281
- Can you hear that?
- Mm-hm.

49:12.283 --> 49:14.984
Hello, hello! Testing!

49:14.986 --> 49:16.919
Do you think you're
gonna be that loud?

49:16.921 --> 49:18.020
I might.

49:19.324 --> 49:20.356
Okay?

49:20.358 --> 49:21.557
Yeah, I don't need to wear them.

49:21.559 --> 49:23.826
Hello, and welcome
to <i> rainbow time.</i>

49:23.828 --> 49:25.528
I'm your host, Shonzi.

49:25.530 --> 49:28.297
And, on tonight's episode,

49:28.299 --> 49:29.899
we're talking about

49:29.901 --> 49:31.167
catcalling.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.301
So stay tuned.

49:32.303 --> 49:35.438
We'll be right back
after this commercial break.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.640
So good! Perfect.

49:37.642 --> 49:39.775
Oh, look, there's
some girls over there.

49:39.777 --> 49:41.410
- Can we talk to them?
- Yes.

49:41.412 --> 49:42.712
Oh, my goodness.

49:43.381 --> 49:45.815
Hey! Hey, wanna be in a movie?

49:45.817 --> 49:47.450
All right, so tell me,

49:47.452 --> 49:49.218
what are some
of the annoying things

49:49.220 --> 49:50.586
that guys say to you,

49:50.588 --> 49:52.655
you know, on the street.

49:52.657 --> 49:54.023
Sugar tits.

49:54.025 --> 49:55.925
- Really?
- Yeah.

49:55.927 --> 49:57.360
"Baby."

49:57.362 --> 49:59.095
"Let me see you smile."

49:59.097 --> 50:01.397
It's like, "hey, yeah,
oh, sweetie!"

50:01.399 --> 50:02.765
And how does that make you feel

50:02.767 --> 50:04.734
when they say that crap?

50:04.736 --> 50:06.836
It's just condescending,

50:06.838 --> 50:08.604
it's a comment that becomes

50:08.606 --> 50:11.240
how I'm sexually
relevant to this man

50:11.242 --> 50:14.910
rather than my brain
or other qualities or whatever.

50:14.912 --> 50:15.845
Right.

50:15.847 --> 50:16.979
You're just walking
down the street.

50:16.981 --> 50:18.914
You're not there
to entertain anyone.

50:18.916 --> 50:21.650
It's like,"hey!
I'm just trying to walk here."

50:21.652 --> 50:23.552
- Exactly.
- "Get out of my way!"

50:23.554 --> 50:24.954
- Right.
- Yeah.

50:24.956 --> 50:26.088
You just wanna get to work.

50:26.090 --> 50:27.690
Sometimes you're just
not in the mood.

50:27.692 --> 50:28.891
No. Exactly.

50:28.893 --> 50:30.092
Exactly.

50:30.094 --> 50:31.594
And guys at home,

50:31.596 --> 50:33.863
you don't need to
have a girl smile

50:33.865 --> 50:36.032
to enjoy how hot they are.

50:36.034 --> 50:36.766
Look here...

50:36.768 --> 50:38.701
You're a very pretty lady,

50:38.703 --> 50:40.036
well, now, you're smiling.

50:40.038 --> 50:42.271
Thank you
for watching <i> rainbow time.</i>

50:42.273 --> 50:45.207
I'm Shonzi, and I've
been here with my friend,

50:45.209 --> 50:46.709
- Sara.
- Sara!

50:46.711 --> 50:49.345
- Hey!
- Hey!

50:49.347 --> 50:51.614
That was so good. Thank you.

50:51.616 --> 50:52.782
You're so pretty.

50:52.784 --> 50:54.316
Shonzi, don't...

50:54.318 --> 50:55.684
Okay, all right, okay.

50:55.686 --> 50:57.119
Do you want to
hang out some time?

50:57.121 --> 50:58.687
No, no, stop. Stop!

50:58.689 --> 50:59.855
Thank you so much.

50:59.857 --> 51:01.557
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.526
I think that's fine, it's okay.

51:03.528 --> 51:04.994
It's not. It's not fine.

51:04.996 --> 51:07.363
Thank you for doing that for us.

51:07.365 --> 51:08.697
What?

51:08.699 --> 51:10.599
You can't just like,
grab someone

51:10.601 --> 51:13.002
and kiss them like that.

51:13.004 --> 51:14.937
Okay, well, I didn't know.

51:14.939 --> 51:17.039
I thought I'm doing
something good, I'm talking...

51:17.041 --> 51:18.974
You are, you are.

51:18.976 --> 51:21.944
But then, you just
have to let people go,

51:21.946 --> 51:24.947
just you know, maybe shake
hands or something, okay?

51:24.949 --> 51:25.981
Great.

51:27.051 --> 51:28.284
Cut.

51:28.286 --> 51:29.852
I did cut.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.339
Oh, hey.

51:51.509 --> 51:52.875
Oh, hey.

51:53.377 --> 51:54.443
How are you?

51:55.046 --> 51:55.911
Not good.

51:55.913 --> 51:57.980
Oh, why? What's going on?

51:57.982 --> 51:59.782
Pizza's wheels
are all messed up.

51:59.784 --> 52:01.383
I don't know what's wrong.

52:01.385 --> 52:02.418
Oh...

52:03.254 --> 52:04.587
Who?

52:04.589 --> 52:05.788
Pizza's my dog.

52:05.790 --> 52:07.656
Your dog's name is pizza?

52:07.658 --> 52:08.824
Yeah.

52:08.826 --> 52:10.726
Oh, hey, um...

52:10.728 --> 52:12.828
Justine, this is Shonzi,
Todd's brother.

52:12.830 --> 52:14.263
This is my friend, Justine.

52:14.265 --> 52:16.098
Yeah, we met last night.

52:16.100 --> 52:18.134
Sort of.

52:18.135 --> 52:20.169
Uh, I mean, yeah,
when I was out smoking.

52:21.139 --> 52:23.105
Smoking? I didn't know
you smoked.

52:23.574 --> 52:24.907
I do.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.709
I like your t-shirt.

52:26.711 --> 52:28.611
Sorry, but I'm just...

52:28.613 --> 52:29.945
I'm not really
in the mood to talk.

52:29.947 --> 52:31.180
I just want to go in,

52:31.182 --> 52:32.781
and just eat
some Doritos, please.

52:32.783 --> 52:34.350
I love Doritos!

52:34.352 --> 52:35.651
What's your favorite kind?

52:35.653 --> 52:37.653
Cool ranch. Jinx!

52:37.655 --> 52:39.455
Two for flinching.

52:39.457 --> 52:40.689
I didn't flinch.

52:40.691 --> 52:43.759
Yes, look at flinching you.

52:43.761 --> 52:45.327
- Got me.
- Oh, man.

52:45.329 --> 52:46.595
- What?
- Nice biceps.

52:46.597 --> 52:47.930
Oh yeah? You like that?

52:47.932 --> 52:50.266
Yeah, I do like
100 push-ups a day.

52:50.268 --> 52:51.667
Nice.

52:51.669 --> 52:52.735
You know what?

52:52.737 --> 52:54.470
We should have Justine
in the movie.

52:54.739 --> 52:56.038
Yes, sure.

52:56.040 --> 52:57.573
Uh...

52:57.575 --> 52:59.208
- Rolling?
- -Rolling.

52:59.210 --> 53:00.676
Uh, so what?

53:00.678 --> 53:03.112
The same questions
I was asking those girls?

53:03.114 --> 53:04.647
Yeah, do you remember?

53:04.649 --> 53:06.916
Yeah, okay.

53:06.918 --> 53:10.152
Yeah, so okay, this probably
doesn't happen to you

53:10.154 --> 53:14.256
but do you ever have guys
yelling at you on the street?

53:14.258 --> 53:15.391
Oh, yeah.

53:15.393 --> 53:17.526
All the time, I hate that.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.895
I mean, like, catcalling.

53:20.131 --> 53:21.297
Yeah.

53:21.599 --> 53:22.665
Guys?

53:22.667 --> 53:23.933
Yeah.

53:24.435 --> 53:25.935
All the time.

53:25.937 --> 53:27.203
I mean, it's a little
hard to believe

53:27.205 --> 53:29.705
because I mean,
you are kind of ugly,

53:29.707 --> 53:32.408
I mean, not totally ugly,

53:32.410 --> 53:33.509
but I mean...

53:33.511 --> 53:35.344
Shonzi.

53:35.346 --> 53:37.813
Why would you say that?

53:37.815 --> 53:39.348
I just mean, because
these other girls

53:39.350 --> 53:40.849
you didn't see
what we were doing, okay?

53:40.851 --> 53:44.253
You have no idea what
we were in the middle of...

53:44.255 --> 53:45.354
Just give that to me.

53:45.356 --> 53:47.623
Okay, I told you
I didn't wanna do this.

53:47.625 --> 53:50.793
All right? I'm sorry you
didn't see these other girls.

53:50.795 --> 53:52.061
Someone can be beautiful
even though

53:52.063 --> 53:53.696
they are not blonde and...

53:53.698 --> 53:56.365
I'm sorry. Jesus Christ!

53:59.303 --> 54:00.836
I'm really sorry.

54:05.443 --> 54:06.609
Dad.

54:06.611 --> 54:08.711
Wanna check out some
of these girls

54:08.713 --> 54:11.180
me and Lindsay
met today for the video?

54:11.649 --> 54:13.249
Check out this one.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.251
Hot, right?

54:15.486 --> 54:16.952
Did you get her number?

54:16.954 --> 54:20.389
I tried, but she said
she had a "boyfriend."

54:20.391 --> 54:23.025
You're never gonna score
unless you take...

54:23.027 --> 54:24.693
- A shot.
- Right?

54:24.695 --> 54:26.295
- Right.
- See, Lindsay?

54:26.297 --> 54:29.198
My dad always taught me
I got to be confident

54:29.200 --> 54:30.132
like the Fonz.

54:30.134 --> 54:32.668
You know, he just
snaps his fingers,

54:32.670 --> 54:34.103
and girls come up to him.

54:34.105 --> 54:35.137
Yeah, um,

54:35.139 --> 54:37.873
sure, but Shonzi, I think,

54:37.875 --> 54:39.875
another thing that
making the video

54:39.877 --> 54:42.678
is helping you realize
is that it's not fun

54:42.680 --> 54:44.713
for women to be
sexually harassed.

54:44.715 --> 54:46.415
Right. Feminism.

54:46.417 --> 54:47.983
- Yes.
- Right.

54:47.985 --> 54:50.586
You know what I need,
is pictures of me.

54:50.588 --> 54:52.421
We put them on a website,

54:52.423 --> 54:54.390
maybe for magazines.

54:54.392 --> 54:56.659
Bro, can you take a photo,

54:56.661 --> 54:57.993
just right now, me and dad,

54:57.995 --> 54:59.495
you know, like
in <i> people</i> magazine,

54:59.497 --> 55:01.630
they have the candid shots.

55:01.632 --> 55:03.932
Sure.
Yeah, yeah.

55:03.934 --> 55:05.701
I'd hold out for

55:05.703 --> 55:07.870
<i>vanity fair,</i>
if I was you, though.

55:07.872 --> 55:09.471
Exactly. Thank you, bro.

55:09.473 --> 55:11.473
You know what?
You should get in it, too.

55:11.475 --> 55:13.108
- Come on, bro.
- Okay.

55:13.110 --> 55:15.177
Okay, but Lindsay, be careful

55:15.179 --> 55:17.513
because you might not
wanna delete

55:17.515 --> 55:20.282
the photo that Todd
took of you last night.

55:22.687 --> 55:25.521
I mean, if you guys have any
photos you don't wanna delete...

55:25.523 --> 55:26.622
What?

55:26.624 --> 55:28.290
What? Did...

55:29.827 --> 55:31.393
Did you show it to him?

55:31.395 --> 55:32.795
No. No.

55:32.797 --> 55:35.364
Lindsay, he didn't
have to, okay?

55:35.366 --> 55:38.334
I only spied on you
so he wouldn't chicken out.

55:38.336 --> 55:41.203
If you're gonna start making
some photos or videos,

55:41.205 --> 55:44.006
you should see these ones
he made with his ex, Lucy.

55:44.008 --> 55:46.542
I mean, a photo
isn't even that kinky.

55:46.544 --> 55:48.077
Oh, my god.

55:56.053 --> 55:58.520
Well, cat's out of the bag now.

55:58.522 --> 56:01.290
Shonzi, when are you gonna
learn to shut your mouth?

56:04.428 --> 56:06.829
You, knowingly,

56:06.831 --> 56:08.697
let Shonzi watch you

56:08.699 --> 56:10.399
take a picture of me

56:10.768 --> 56:11.967
naked.

56:12.169 --> 56:13.469
Yeah.

56:14.238 --> 56:15.437
I mean, why?

56:15.439 --> 56:17.539
Because, he said
he was gonna tell you

56:17.541 --> 56:18.974
about the video

56:18.976 --> 56:21.443
I showed him of me and my ex.

56:21.445 --> 56:24.012
Why would you show Shonzi

56:24.014 --> 56:26.682
videos of you
and your ex, anyway?

56:26.684 --> 56:27.684
I don't...

56:38.929 --> 56:40.462
Um...

56:42.700 --> 56:44.199
When mom died,

56:45.136 --> 56:48.771
he went into
a really dark place.

56:48.773 --> 56:50.038
He was a mess,

56:50.040 --> 56:51.840
and he locked himself
in his room

56:51.842 --> 56:53.642
for like, two weeks.

56:55.012 --> 56:56.412
We called it...

56:56.947 --> 56:58.580
Solitary.

56:58.582 --> 57:00.516
Shonzi's in solitary again.

57:00.518 --> 57:03.085
We were worried that he
was going to hurt himself.

57:04.054 --> 57:06.355
So I was kind of trying
everything I could

57:06.357 --> 57:08.190
to get him out.

57:08.192 --> 57:09.425
And...

57:12.029 --> 57:13.529
And it was working.

57:15.766 --> 57:19.368
I mean, I feel bad,
I feel guilty.

57:19.370 --> 57:23.372
He's never gonna
experience that, you know?

57:23.374 --> 57:25.407
I just wanted him
to feel normal.

57:31.449 --> 57:32.481
I mean,

57:33.951 --> 57:35.517
I do...

57:35.519 --> 57:37.486
I understand, kind of,

57:37.488 --> 57:38.921
on some level, but,

57:38.923 --> 57:43.192
that's not treating him
like he is normal.

57:43.194 --> 57:46.395
Like you wouldn't do that
with one of your guy friends.

57:47.832 --> 57:50.098
- Right? I hope.
- No.

57:50.100 --> 57:51.934
Wouldn't be like, "look
at this video," so...

57:51.936 --> 57:53.368
No.

57:53.370 --> 57:56.305
Because you are
doing that with him,

57:56.307 --> 57:57.940
it's saying, "you're not normal,

57:57.942 --> 58:00.576
"and I need to
do this with you."

58:00.578 --> 58:03.712
I just wish I knew
how we could help him.

58:04.515 --> 58:06.248
Yeah...

58:08.118 --> 58:11.053
I wonder if we could maybe

58:11.055 --> 58:13.288
make this like,
part of my project.

58:13.290 --> 58:15.724
And that could help him
to understand that,

58:15.726 --> 58:17.292
you know, he's not the only one

58:17.294 --> 58:19.595
who's doing something
wrong all the time.

58:19.597 --> 58:20.996
He's not just being told,

58:20.998 --> 58:22.264
"that's not okay."

58:22.266 --> 58:23.432
Yeah.

58:23.434 --> 58:25.334
You're saying, "I did
something that's not okay."

58:25.336 --> 58:26.468
Yeah.

58:28.105 --> 58:31.039
Or, we could just
drop him off at Nina's.

58:31.041 --> 58:32.407
This is the kind of thing

58:32.409 --> 58:34.510
that we need to deal with, okay?

58:35.779 --> 58:36.912
Okay.

58:36.914 --> 58:38.413
- Okay?
- Yeah.

58:46.190 --> 58:47.623
Is that creepy?

58:48.659 --> 58:50.859
Just maybe try to look like

58:50.861 --> 58:54.596
you're looking at something
sexy, though, you know?

58:54.598 --> 58:56.198
I can do sexy.

58:56.667 --> 58:57.799
I'll go like this.

58:57.801 --> 58:58.901
I'll be like,

58:58.903 --> 59:02.371
I'll imagine
two people making out.

59:02.840 --> 59:04.172
Okay?

59:04.174 --> 59:05.574
I'm not gonna say what
two people...

59:05.576 --> 59:07.309
Okay, buddy,
we can't use the shot

59:07.311 --> 59:08.577
if you're talking in it, okay?

59:08.579 --> 59:10.546
Let's get this shot with
you standing still, okay?

59:10.548 --> 59:11.513
Okay.

59:11.515 --> 59:12.581
I think it's us.

59:14.285 --> 59:15.684
That's ridiculous.

59:15.686 --> 59:18.687
I know, I know.
I'm just trying to...

59:18.689 --> 59:21.290
It's less of like a face.

59:21.292 --> 59:23.559
It's less of like a...

59:23.928 --> 59:25.227
Any of that.

59:25.229 --> 59:27.529
I think it's more just
like a blank face.

59:27.998 --> 59:29.765
And no talking.

59:29.767 --> 59:31.967
I think we just need,

59:31.969 --> 59:33.936
just like a few
seconds of you just,

59:33.938 --> 59:36.271
standing and saying nothing.

59:36.273 --> 59:37.806
Just not talking.

59:37.808 --> 59:38.807
How many seconds?

59:38.809 --> 59:39.908
Like, thirty.

59:39.910 --> 59:41.276
One, two...

59:41.278 --> 59:43.245
Don't count, dude.
Don't count.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.846
I want to get it right.
How am I going to...

59:44.848 --> 59:45.848
I'll tell you.

59:46.584 --> 59:47.716
Okay.

59:52.790 --> 59:53.989
I think we got it.

59:53.991 --> 59:55.857
- Yeah.
- I think we got enough, yeah.

59:55.859 --> 59:57.025
We got it.

59:57.027 --> 59:59.428
Relax, Todd.
She said we got it.

01:00:00.331 --> 01:00:02.264
So, Todd, if you don't mind,

01:00:02.266 --> 01:00:05.067
just explain a little bit
about what it is

01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:07.636
you like about videotaping

01:00:08.405 --> 01:00:11.940
yourself and your girlfriends.

01:00:13.210 --> 01:00:14.843
I don't know, um...

01:00:16.313 --> 01:00:17.879
It's just exciting...

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.651
To know that a girl is willing

01:00:23.487 --> 01:00:25.721
to do that

01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:29.358
for you because she
likes you that much.

01:00:30.694 --> 01:00:31.760
I guess.

01:00:31.762 --> 01:00:34.496
I mean, I guess the thing
I'm wondering is why...

01:00:35.866 --> 01:00:38.934
You want someone
to put themselves

01:00:38.936 --> 01:00:42.371
in an uncomfortable situation.

01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:45.040
Like, when you're in love,
you do things

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:46.775
for the other person,

01:00:46.777 --> 01:00:50.278
even if it makes you
uncomfortable, right?

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.215
Like when we were
dating at first,

01:00:53.217 --> 01:00:54.683
when you were married,

01:00:54.685 --> 01:00:57.019
that was kind of
uncomfortable for me,

01:00:58.122 --> 01:00:59.454
and I, kind of,
hiding that, but,

01:00:59.456 --> 01:01:02.190
I did it, and
I don't know, I just,

01:01:02.192 --> 01:01:04.593
I guess I wish
you would humor me.

01:01:04.595 --> 01:01:07.062
Right. It's a give and take.

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:08.897
It would be a nice reassurance.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:13.869
A reassurance...

01:01:14.104 --> 01:01:15.971
Of what?

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:18.440
That you're not gonna leave me

01:01:18.442 --> 01:01:20.876
when things get bad,
like you did

01:01:20.878 --> 01:01:22.511
with Adam for me.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:28.383
I wanna do the videos

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:30.952
because it's like
a way of controlling

01:01:32.056 --> 01:01:33.955
the situation,

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:35.857
because even if you do leave me,

01:01:35.859 --> 01:01:37.559
I'll still kinda have you.

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:51.206
I know how hard that is.

01:01:51.208 --> 01:01:53.875
I'm so proud of you
for your honesty

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.911
and for telling me all this.

01:01:56.747 --> 01:01:58.180
I love you so much.

01:01:58.182 --> 01:02:00.082
I love you so much.

01:02:00.084 --> 01:02:01.316
Yeah.

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:04.986
Guys,

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:06.254
we're still rolling here.

01:02:06.256 --> 01:02:09.291
Can we focus a little bit?

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:10.392
I don't know,

01:02:10.394 --> 01:02:12.127
I feel like we got

01:02:12.129 --> 01:02:14.296
so much good stuff.

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:17.733
Like we got really,
a lot of really, um...

01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:19.367
What?

01:02:19.369 --> 01:02:21.870
Aren't you gonna
ask me some questions?

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:22.804
Tomorrow.

01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:26.007
Yeah, we gotta
hit the sack, dude.

01:02:26.009 --> 01:02:27.442
Yeah.

01:02:27.444 --> 01:02:30.445
Yeah, we're gonna, um...

01:02:30.447 --> 01:02:32.380
But thank you for helping.

01:02:32.382 --> 01:02:34.182
You were such a great help.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:35.650
You were wonderful.

01:02:35.652 --> 01:02:37.018
Thank you, um...

01:02:37.020 --> 01:02:38.386
The remote's right there,

01:02:38.388 --> 01:02:40.222
you can watch whatever you want.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.624
Okay, well, just go
right to sleep, guys.

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.460
We can get
an early start tomorrow.

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:47.996
No funny business, all right?

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.151
I love it when
you kiss me there.

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:10.986
Where else?

01:03:11.722 --> 01:03:13.455
Right there.

01:03:13.757 --> 01:03:14.890
Right here?

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:17.459
Hey, guys!

01:03:18.462 --> 01:03:19.628
Not now, dude.

01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:23.431
Well, guys, I started
a fire by accident.

01:03:23.433 --> 01:03:25.400
I'm really sorry.

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:26.968
Not now, buddy.

01:03:27.671 --> 01:03:28.937
Help!

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:31.573
There's smoke everywhere.

01:03:31.975 --> 01:03:33.241
It's all right.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:35.343
Oh no, honey, wait, look.

01:03:35.345 --> 01:03:37.479
What did you do now, dude?

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:40.182
What the fuck, man?

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:41.184
Gotcha.

01:03:42.019 --> 01:03:43.718
Jesus Christ.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:45.220
You really think I'm so stupid

01:03:45.222 --> 01:03:46.755
I lit the house on fire?

01:03:46.757 --> 01:03:48.156
Yeah, maybe.

01:03:48.158 --> 01:03:51.059
Looks like you guys got
your own fire going on here.

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.527
What do you want, man?

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:54.963
I got this great new idea
for the film.

01:03:54.965 --> 01:03:56.832
Okay, it's gonna have to
wait till tomorrow.

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.217
I'm sorry.

01:03:58.218 --> 01:03:59.601
Wait, wait, wait.
Lindsay, please can I tell you?

01:03:59.603 --> 01:04:01.636
I don't wanna
forget it. Please?

01:04:01.638 --> 01:04:02.370
Okay.

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:04.673
She said okay, bro, relax.

01:04:04.675 --> 01:04:07.209
Okay, do you know
what a dream sequence is?

01:04:07.211 --> 01:04:08.210
Uh-huh.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:09.511
We could have a dream sequence

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:11.379
where you and I are kissing.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:12.747
Okay, nice try, buddy.

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:15.283
We could just be dancing
or something, you know?

01:04:15.285 --> 01:04:17.118
We could be slow dancing.

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.486
Maybe, maybe.

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:20.288
Just fucking say no.

01:04:20.290 --> 01:04:21.489
Just say no to him.

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.124
I don't want to
just shut him down.

01:04:23.126 --> 01:04:24.226
Well, we don't have to

01:04:24.228 --> 01:04:25.727
fucking listen to him
right now, okay?

01:04:25.729 --> 01:04:28.196
Todd, please don't swear at me.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:29.431
He's manipulating you.

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:30.632
Can't you see that?

01:04:30.634 --> 01:04:32.801
I think it's important
to hear his ideas.

01:04:32.803 --> 01:04:34.603
You don't fucking listen to me.

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:36.538
You know this
makes me uncomfortable,

01:04:36.540 --> 01:04:39.507
and you say it's my anger issues

01:04:39.509 --> 01:04:41.610
or some shit, and
I'm fucking sick of it.

01:04:41.612 --> 01:04:43.778
Don't fucking touch me.

01:04:44.781 --> 01:04:45.881
Calm down.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.985
Meet me in the car.
I'm taking you to Nina's.

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:53.788
Are you okay?

01:05:02.432 --> 01:05:03.665
Wait here.

01:05:07.237 --> 01:05:09.271
Hey. Hey...

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:11.907
Where are you going?

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:14.743
I thought I would stay
at my place tonight.

01:05:15.479 --> 01:05:16.945
I'm sorry I freaked out.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:19.015
I...

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:20.982
And I didn't mean to...

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:22.183
I don't know what to say.

01:05:22.686 --> 01:05:23.686
I...

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:26.021
I don't know.

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:29.925
You know, I actually haven't
had much time to myself

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:31.159
since I left Adam.

01:05:36.700 --> 01:05:38.533
You're just gonna give up?

01:05:39.703 --> 01:05:41.036
I feel like I've been

01:05:42.339 --> 01:05:43.405
pretty patient.

01:05:43.407 --> 01:05:44.572
Really?

01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.278
Please, please,

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.913
just give me
one more chance, please.

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:54.616
I really just wanna go.

01:05:54.618 --> 01:05:56.017
I'm so sorry.

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.070
Hi, you guys.

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:16.304
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:17.439
Sorry, it's so late.

01:06:17.441 --> 01:06:18.907
It's okay.

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:20.608
You could have waited
till tomorrow.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.510
It's really okay,
I'll just order food.

01:06:22.512 --> 01:06:23.645
Hungry? Want something?

01:06:23.647 --> 01:06:24.813
No, I gotta get going.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.982
- Mom!
- Okay, I'm coming.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:29.551
But, are you gonna be
at the hospital tomorrow?

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:30.518
Mom!

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.554
I'm coming! God.

01:06:32.556 --> 01:06:35.790
Teenagers can be
total douchebags, ugh.

01:06:43.033 --> 01:06:44.466
All right.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.401
See you later, dude.

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:48.236
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

01:06:48.238 --> 01:06:49.471
I'm jealous.

01:06:49.473 --> 01:06:51.106
I'm jealous of what you have.

01:06:51.108 --> 01:06:52.140
Don't worry about it.

01:06:52.142 --> 01:06:53.441
Okay, what are you gonna say?

01:06:53.443 --> 01:06:55.343
What, are you gonna call her?

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:56.678
Just let me do my thing, okay?

01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:59.047
You worry about your own shit.

01:06:59.049 --> 01:07:00.281
Look, I'm sorry.

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:02.684
I'm only, just so,

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:04.285
you know, trying to help you,

01:07:04.287 --> 01:07:05.387
because,

01:07:05.389 --> 01:07:07.188
I know I don't have a chance,

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:10.058
I'm gonna die alone
in a group home, all right?

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:11.793
I'm not gonna have
what you have,

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:14.095
but, I don't know,
you owe it to me, man.

01:07:14.097 --> 01:07:15.030
What?

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:16.564
To be happy.

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:17.866
I don't care about myself.

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:20.568
I know I'm a fucking lost cause.

01:07:20.570 --> 01:07:22.570
You want me to be happy?

01:07:22.572 --> 01:07:24.973
Stop doing this
pity-party shit.

01:07:24.975 --> 01:07:26.107
Okay?

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:27.409
Stop trying to help me

01:07:27.411 --> 01:07:28.610
with my relationships.

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.845
Do you realize that
you're the reason why

01:07:31.314 --> 01:07:34.082
she left me tonight?

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:36.317
Just worry about yourself,
do your thing.

01:07:36.319 --> 01:07:38.186
I'll do mine, okay?

01:07:38.188 --> 01:07:39.254
I gotta go.

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:40.722
I'm...

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:21.662
Hey, Fonzie.

01:08:21.665 --> 01:08:23.264
Mrs. Cunningham?

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.698
Would you do me a favor

01:08:24.701 --> 01:08:26.367
and would you check on Lily?

01:08:26.368 --> 01:08:27.801
- I have to take off.
- Uh-huh.

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:29.837
And we have a rule, there's
no boys if I'm not here,

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.872
but she's also, um...

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:33.774
You need to have sunscreen on.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:36.978
I'm fine. Trying to get
a new base layer.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:38.947
Okay, you're super-freckly.

01:08:38.948 --> 01:08:40.482
There's your
base layer, freckles.

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:41.515
Check it out.

01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:43.218
Don't do that.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.252
Just check on her, okay?
When I'm gone.

01:08:45.255 --> 01:08:46.254
No boys.

01:08:46.256 --> 01:08:47.322
- All right.
- Okay.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.890
Cool. Got it.

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:50.457
Lookin' good. Good for you.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:51.460
Ninety-nine.

01:08:51.962 --> 01:08:53.194
One hundred.

01:08:53.196 --> 01:08:54.496
This is from forever 21,

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.663
and this is from
Abercrombie & Fitch.

01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:58.765
And this is from h&m.

01:08:58.768 --> 01:09:01.536
And these and this
is from forever 21, too.

01:09:01.537 --> 01:09:03.104
Hm.

01:09:03.106 --> 01:09:05.006
Yeah, it's like
my favorite store.

01:09:15.185 --> 01:09:16.518
Oh.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:17.752
Is that okay?

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:19.354
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:09:23.126 --> 01:09:24.225
Hold on.

01:09:25.929 --> 01:09:27.729
I just want to
take my earring out.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.176
Shonzi.

01:09:42.179 --> 01:09:43.578
Lily.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:44.779
Your mom said

01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:47.649
you're not supposed to
have "guests" over.

01:09:47.651 --> 01:09:49.216
It's fine, Shonzi.

01:09:49.219 --> 01:09:51.886
Why don't you guys
come into the...

01:09:51.888 --> 01:09:54.789
Big house and watch
some TV with me, all right?

01:09:54.791 --> 01:09:56.524
We could have some cookies.

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:58.560
Hey, buddy, uh...

01:09:58.562 --> 01:10:00.562
We're fine here, so if you just

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.829
close the door on your way out.

01:10:01.831 --> 01:10:03.831
Okay, you're embarrassing me.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:05.700
Lily, your mom said,

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:06.701
okay? No boys.

01:10:06.703 --> 01:10:07.835
It's fine.

01:10:07.837 --> 01:10:10.238
- Just get out!
- Look, Lily...

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:13.375
Lily...

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:16.978
Lily, open the door.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:18.479
Lily!

01:10:22.085 --> 01:10:23.952
Hold on a sec.

01:10:23.954 --> 01:10:26.521
Maybe we should
take a little break, okay?

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:28.424
No, come on.

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.191
Don't you like me?

01:10:30.193 --> 01:10:32.794
I'm just feeling
a little weird, that's all.

01:10:34.231 --> 01:10:35.396
It's okay.

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:36.398
Don't worry.

01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:41.169
No, stop.

01:10:47.644 --> 01:10:49.210
No, no...

01:10:50.847 --> 01:10:52.080
Oh, damn it!

01:10:56.186 --> 01:10:58.253
Shonzi, get out!

01:10:58.255 --> 01:11:00.521
You cannot have
boys here, all right?

01:11:00.523 --> 01:11:01.889
You're too young.

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:03.725
Come on, you gotta get out.

01:11:03.727 --> 01:11:04.826
Are you serious, dude?

01:11:04.828 --> 01:11:07.228
Yeah, I'm serious
as a heart attack.

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:10.265
Bro.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:11.299
Dude!

01:11:11.301 --> 01:11:12.700
You gotta go.

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:13.901
You're not listening to her.

01:11:13.903 --> 01:11:15.336
She is not into it.

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:17.238
I'm not leaving, retard.

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.673
Oh, I'm a retard?

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:19.641
Yeah.

01:11:19.643 --> 01:11:20.708
Well then, looks like

01:11:20.710 --> 01:11:21.776
it's time to take out the trash.

01:11:21.778 --> 01:11:22.977
Come on, let's go.

01:11:25.282 --> 01:11:26.347
Wanna go?

01:11:27.484 --> 01:11:29.017
Come on, let's go.

01:11:29.019 --> 01:11:30.752
What are you doing?

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:31.853
Fuck!

01:11:31.855 --> 01:11:33.254
You say anything to upset him?

01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:35.690
No, he just came in

01:11:35.692 --> 01:11:36.924
and started hitting me.

01:11:36.926 --> 01:11:38.626
Did you provoke him in any way?

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:39.927
Provoked him?

01:11:39.929 --> 01:11:41.095
What, are you saying

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:42.397
my son deserved to get
his face bashed in?

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:44.399
But Nina, you told me
to watch them, all right?

01:11:44.401 --> 01:11:45.900
Yeah, I didn't tell you
to punch him.

01:11:45.902 --> 01:11:47.769
Okay, I could see what
they were doing, all right?

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:49.270
It was going too far.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:51.473
Lily?

01:11:52.976 --> 01:11:54.976
We were just watching a video.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:11:57.845
I think you got confused.

01:11:57.847 --> 01:11:59.047
That's not true.

01:11:59.049 --> 01:12:00.481
All you have to do
is say you're sorry.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:01.549
- Just apologize.
- No!

01:12:01.551 --> 01:12:04.519
All right? I'm not gonna
be the one apologizing.

01:12:04.521 --> 01:12:05.953
Take it easy.

01:12:05.955 --> 01:12:07.455
Wanna help me here?

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:12.460
Hey.

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:13.928
Hey.

01:12:13.930 --> 01:12:16.064
He forgot to take
his meds or something.

01:12:16.066 --> 01:12:18.099
Yeah, we're pressing charges.

01:12:18.101 --> 01:12:20.301
Off his meds? Next time,
he's gonna have a knife.

01:12:20.303 --> 01:12:22.570
Through the window,
I could see the whole thing.

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:23.604
All right, dude?

01:12:23.606 --> 01:12:25.573
They were kissing, all right?

01:12:25.575 --> 01:12:27.942
And he was touching her.

01:12:28.578 --> 01:12:30.011
You were watching them?

01:12:30.347 --> 01:12:31.646
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:31.648 --> 01:12:33.381
I saw the whole thing, okay?

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:42.290
What are we gonna do?

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:43.458
I don't know.

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:46.494
He's an adult,

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.197
Nina, maybe it's time
he's treated like one.

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:52.100
So, we're gonna let him
get arrested?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.036
How else is he gonna learn?

01:12:56.239 --> 01:12:57.271
Oh, god.

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.574
He understand his rights?

01:13:04.180 --> 01:13:05.713
He understand his rights?

01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:06.715
Yeah!

01:13:08.184 --> 01:13:09.951
Guys, I didn't do anything.

01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:12.520
Guys, I saved her.

01:13:12.822 --> 01:13:14.522
Lily!

01:13:14.524 --> 01:13:16.457
Ow! That hurts, dude.

01:13:16.459 --> 01:13:17.625
Let's go, son.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:18.793
Wait a second.

01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:20.027
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay!

01:13:20.029 --> 01:13:22.196
- Just give me a second!
- Go, come on.

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:24.165
Guys, this is stupid, okay?

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.367
He called me a retard!

01:13:26.369 --> 01:13:27.969
Stop! Lily!

01:13:27.971 --> 01:13:29.771
He called me a retard!

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:31.472
All right? That's not fair!

01:13:31.474 --> 01:13:32.540
Wait, wait!

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.243
He didn't do anything wrong.

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:37.512
What?

01:13:37.514 --> 01:13:38.546
Lily.

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:39.947
He was telling the truth.

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:41.382
See? Let go of me!

01:13:41.384 --> 01:13:43.317
Let him go.

01:14:01.805 --> 01:14:03.237
Hey.

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:04.605
How're you doing, bud?

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:05.607
Fine.

01:14:10.413 --> 01:14:12.780
Wanna go get some
burgers or something?

01:14:14.451 --> 01:14:15.516
Not hungry.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:19.420
Hey, you could stay
at my place tonight.

01:14:22.859 --> 01:14:24.125
Buddy,

01:14:24.394 --> 01:14:25.426
come on.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.095
Shonzi!

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:51.118
<i>Hey Linds, it's me, just thought</i>

01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.920
I'd call to check in,

01:14:52.922 --> 01:14:54.222
see how you are doing.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.657
Also, you left some stuff

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:58.092
at my place.

01:14:58.461 --> 01:14:59.594
<i>Um,</i>

01:14:59.596 --> 01:15:01.395
<i>if you wanna come get it.</i>

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:03.664
<i>Um...</i>

01:15:04.734 --> 01:15:06.400
I miss you.

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:08.569
Bye.

01:15:13.443 --> 01:15:15.076
I just need to file this

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:16.878
first thing tomorrow morning,

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.747
and you'll be
officially divorced.

01:15:19.749 --> 01:15:21.115
Congratulations.

01:15:25.688 --> 01:15:27.054
Hello?

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:29.257
I'm getting tired
of Shonzi solitary.

01:15:29.259 --> 01:15:31.359
Come on, please,
come out, Shonzi.

01:15:33.596 --> 01:15:34.829
Shonzi?

01:16:20.343 --> 01:16:21.375
Hey.

01:16:21.377 --> 01:16:22.377
Hey.

01:16:23.413 --> 01:16:24.512
Todd here?

01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:27.181
No, um...

01:16:29.052 --> 01:16:31.185
We had kind of a falling out.

01:16:32.121 --> 01:16:33.621
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

01:16:33.623 --> 01:16:34.623
Yeah.

01:16:35.258 --> 01:16:37.325
But I just wanted to stop by

01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:39.760
and see how you're doing,

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.395
and to say goodbye,

01:16:41.831 --> 01:16:43.197
and also,

01:16:43.199 --> 01:16:45.333
to bring you this.

01:16:46.202 --> 01:16:47.868
It's an essential oil blend

01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:49.270
that I made.

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:51.539
It's supposed to be
really good for your heart.

01:16:51.541 --> 01:16:53.007
How nice.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:54.542
Thank you.

01:16:54.544 --> 01:16:56.510
Come, come.
Come, sit for a second.

01:16:57.547 --> 01:16:58.547
Oh.

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.282
Good.

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:10.257
So what's up with you and Todd?

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:12.460
I don't know.

01:17:12.462 --> 01:17:15.196
It's probably for the best.

01:17:16.666 --> 01:17:20.134
I've had a very hard year

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:22.637
with the divorce
and everything, and...

01:17:25.074 --> 01:17:28.309
I really tried, but um...

01:17:29.379 --> 01:17:31.212
I think it's just bad timing.

01:17:34.851 --> 01:17:37.585
I really don't want to
make the same mistakes.

01:17:38.421 --> 01:17:39.421
Yeah.

01:17:39.956 --> 01:17:41.355
You know what?

01:17:43.126 --> 01:17:45.693
I'm not much on advice, but...

01:17:46.629 --> 01:17:48.829
The relationships
that I have seen work

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:52.133
are the ones where

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:55.102
one person just accepts
the other person

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:57.505
as they are,
don't try to change them.

01:17:58.608 --> 01:17:59.608
Yeah.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:03.678
But don't you think that

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.614
people should be aware
of what their problems are

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:09.550
and the work that
they have to do?

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:11.686
Having a kid like Shaun

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:16.691
just made me aware
that life's not perfect...

01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:22.463
And people aren't perfect,

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:23.497
and you just got to love them

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:25.366
the way they are, you know?

01:18:32.742 --> 01:18:33.941
What do you want?

01:18:35.244 --> 01:18:36.844
I'm gonna fuck you up.

01:18:40.650 --> 01:18:42.249
No!

01:18:45.188 --> 01:18:46.754
Go away, dad!

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:48.689
I'm not hungry.

01:18:51.627 --> 01:18:52.693
Hey, buddy.

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:56.931
What do you want?

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:59.967
Um, I was thinking we could

01:18:59.969 --> 01:19:00.935
shoot a movie.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:02.470
I got an idea for a movie.

01:19:03.039 --> 01:19:05.339
Okay, what's it about?

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:07.308
It's about two brothers.

01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:09.110
Boring.

01:19:09.112 --> 01:19:11.912
And uh, one brother

01:19:11.914 --> 01:19:13.714
is an asshole,

01:19:14.584 --> 01:19:15.850
and he fucked up

01:19:16.152 --> 01:19:17.418
really bad.

01:19:19.355 --> 01:19:21.322
He betrayed the other brother

01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:24.492
and he feels real bad about it

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:25.960
and...

01:19:28.231 --> 01:19:29.997
And they're ninjas.

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.366
They're ninja brothers.

01:19:34.036 --> 01:19:35.669
Ninja betrayal, huh?

01:19:35.671 --> 01:19:36.737
Yeah.

01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:39.740
And the only thing is
that I can't figure out

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:41.809
is how to end it.

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:45.546
You know, how do they make up?

01:19:45.548 --> 01:19:47.414
Maybe you could
help me out with that?

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:51.585
I should like, hit you.

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:53.587
Do you want to
take a swing at me?

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:55.589
Wanna hit... ow!

01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:57.958
You can do it again.
You want to hit me again?

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:01.562
Maybe you should just keep

01:20:02.365 --> 01:20:05.499
just doing more damage to me.

01:20:05.501 --> 01:20:07.968
You should hit me
on the head with a bottle,

01:20:07.970 --> 01:20:09.236
cut my arms off...

01:20:09.238 --> 01:20:10.704
I should cut your dick off.

01:20:10.706 --> 01:20:13.440
Cut my dick off,
we could do that.

01:20:13.442 --> 01:20:15.876
If you cut my dick off,
will you forgive me?

01:20:18.047 --> 01:20:19.513
Maybe.

01:20:19.515 --> 01:20:21.415
I'm really sorry, man.

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:26.587
I just can't be the
one who's like

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:29.924
trying to love you,

01:20:29.926 --> 01:20:31.725
and you treat me like a...

01:20:31.727 --> 01:20:33.561
I love you.

01:20:33.563 --> 01:20:35.930
I'm sorry, okay? I...

01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:39.834
You've always been there
for me, and I...

01:20:42.004 --> 01:20:45.339
I'll never do that again, okay?
I swear to god.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:47.308
Yeah, when you look down
and you have no dick,

01:20:47.310 --> 01:20:48.709
you will remember.

01:20:48.711 --> 01:20:50.110
Exactly.

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:51.779
Not to treat me like that.

01:20:51.781 --> 01:20:52.813
I know.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:55.049
Come here.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:01.755
Just don't do that, okay?

01:21:02.792 --> 01:21:03.891
I won't.

01:21:05.928 --> 01:21:08.028
All right, let's go
make a movie, huh?

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.430
All right.

01:21:18.941 --> 01:21:20.541
Come on, Shonzi.

01:21:20.543 --> 01:21:22.476
All right, coming!

01:21:34.757 --> 01:21:35.956
Oh...

01:21:36.759 --> 01:21:37.958
Oh...

01:21:38.828 --> 01:21:39.994
Oh.

01:21:39.996 --> 01:21:42.029
No! Father!

01:21:42.031 --> 01:21:43.230
Don't die!

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:44.965
Father, are you okay?

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:48.936
I do not know how much longer

01:21:48.938 --> 01:21:50.337
I have left, son.

01:21:50.339 --> 01:21:52.539
No! You can't die!

01:21:53.209 --> 01:21:54.942
I have heard

01:21:54.944 --> 01:21:56.577
about your adventures.

01:21:56.579 --> 01:22:00.147
And I have some gifts
I wish to bestow.

01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:01.415
Thank you.

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.918
And please,
take my leather jacket

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:07.087
that I have worn on
so many adventures.

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:08.289
Whoa!

01:22:08.291 --> 01:22:10.257
Shit, hold on.

01:22:10.259 --> 01:22:12.226
Technical difficulties, hold on.

01:22:12.995 --> 01:22:14.495
Okay, give me a second.

01:22:16.365 --> 01:22:17.731
Thanks for doing this.

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.701
A man with will.
I like it.

01:22:21.904 --> 01:22:23.370
I'm happy to help.

01:22:23.372 --> 01:22:25.105
You know, I'm...

01:22:25.107 --> 01:22:27.608
I'm sorry you got to
worry about me so much,

01:22:27.610 --> 01:22:30.077
and that I'm a
disappointment to you.

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:31.079
What?

01:22:32.214 --> 01:22:34.415
You're not a disappointment.

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.116
You can be a pain
in the ass sometimes,

01:22:36.118 --> 01:22:37.952
but you're not a disappointment.

01:22:37.954 --> 01:22:39.620
You are a good son,

01:22:40.990 --> 01:22:42.656
you took care of mom,

01:22:43.459 --> 01:22:44.992
you're taking care of me,

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:47.494
you're my man.

01:22:51.267 --> 01:22:52.566
We're good.

01:22:52.969 --> 01:22:54.168
Okay? All right.

01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:56.370
What do I say now?

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:58.038
Just give me the words.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:00.474
"Promise me that
you'll find your brother

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.242
"and rule my kingdom."

01:23:03.346 --> 01:23:06.613
Just promise me
that you will find

01:23:06.615 --> 01:23:09.016
your brother, and together,

01:23:09.018 --> 01:23:12.353
you will rule my kingdom
after I am gone.

01:23:12.355 --> 01:23:14.021
Uh, that might be tricky.

01:23:14.023 --> 01:23:15.055
Why?

01:23:15.057 --> 01:23:18.025
Because, I cut his dick off!

01:23:18.561 --> 01:23:22.296
Well, then, use this.

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:24.832
I will not be
needing it any more.

01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:26.533
Hey!

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:28.702
No! Father!

01:23:29.038 --> 01:23:30.104
Oh, well.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:42.916
Sorry.

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:49.723
Brother!

01:23:54.797 --> 01:23:55.829
No!

01:23:55.831 --> 01:23:56.964
Yes!

01:24:03.639 --> 01:24:05.205
Don't do this, brother.

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:07.007
You cut my dick off.

01:24:07.009 --> 01:24:10.177
I know, I'm sorry,
I was just jealous.

01:24:10.179 --> 01:24:11.179
But, look!

01:24:12.681 --> 01:24:13.781
Is that dad's?

01:24:13.783 --> 01:24:15.315
You better believe it.

01:24:15.317 --> 01:24:17.484
Quick, we don't have much time.

01:24:17.486 --> 01:24:19.420
Okay, but just be careful.

01:24:19.422 --> 01:24:21.055
Oh, be careful.

01:24:22.758 --> 01:24:25.192
Hold still, this is
a delicate procedure.

01:24:25.194 --> 01:24:26.360
Be careful.

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:28.595
It's not taking.

01:24:28.597 --> 01:24:30.664
Come on, you son of a bitch.

01:24:30.666 --> 01:24:33.033
Come on, don't die on us.

01:24:33.035 --> 01:24:34.234
Give him mouth-to-mouth.

01:24:35.538 --> 01:24:37.504
Feel for a heartbeat.

01:24:37.506 --> 01:24:38.705
Oh, come on.

01:24:38.707 --> 01:24:41.275
What does it say?
Do you hear anything?

01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:43.811
He wishes he'd traveled more.

01:24:43.813 --> 01:24:45.779
I'm sorry, little guy.

01:24:45.781 --> 01:24:47.147
Come on.

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:52.219
Hello.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:53.353
Hey.

01:24:53.355 --> 01:24:54.855
Hi. Hello.

01:24:55.758 --> 01:24:57.424
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:58.692
Um...

01:24:59.495 --> 01:25:01.595
You texted me?

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:03.263
You asked me to come, so...

01:25:04.366 --> 01:25:05.833
Guilty.

01:25:05.835 --> 01:25:08.235
I texted you from your phone

01:25:08.237 --> 01:25:09.369
when you weren't looking.

01:25:10.473 --> 01:25:12.506
Um, okay.

01:25:12.508 --> 01:25:15.809
Lindsay, you and I
have great chemistry,

01:25:15.811 --> 01:25:16.910
but...

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:19.580
I think you should be
with my brother.

01:25:19.582 --> 01:25:21.014
Yeah, yeah.

01:25:22.184 --> 01:25:23.717
It's just bad timing.

01:25:23.719 --> 01:25:25.319
Another time, another place.

01:25:25.321 --> 01:25:26.386
Sure.

01:25:28.691 --> 01:25:30.958
Well, I'll leave you guys to it.

01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:31.892
Thanks.

01:25:31.894 --> 01:25:32.926
Thank you.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.066
Uh...

01:25:39.902 --> 01:25:41.535
Just give me one second, okay?

01:25:41.537 --> 01:25:42.736
Yeah.

01:25:45.941 --> 01:25:48.442
Hey, hey, hey.
Dude, dude.

01:25:48.444 --> 01:25:52.279
Um, sorry we had to stop
doing the movie.

01:25:52.281 --> 01:25:53.361
That's cool, man, I get it.

01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:55.716
I'll just see you later.

01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:57.451
Where are you going?

01:25:57.453 --> 01:25:59.153
I'm just gonna
take a walk or something.

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:00.387
Get out of your hair.

01:26:01.123 --> 01:26:02.756
All right. Hey, uh...

01:26:03.759 --> 01:26:05.025
Thanks for being so cool.

01:26:05.027 --> 01:26:07.127
Yeah, cool like Fonzie, right?

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:08.228
Ahh!

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:10.697
Good luck.

01:26:10.699 --> 01:26:12.132
Okay, be careful.

01:26:20.509 --> 01:26:24.378
So, I have been doing
a lot of thinking.

01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:26.813
Yeah, me too.

01:26:26.815 --> 01:26:29.249
And I understand
why you resent me.

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:32.753
I don't resent you.

01:26:32.755 --> 01:26:35.322
No, it's okay, I mean...

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:38.325
Come on,
I made you sneak around.

01:26:38.327 --> 01:26:42.429
I really just dragged you
through my whole divorce,

01:26:42.431 --> 01:26:44.064
which isn't fair.

01:26:44.066 --> 01:26:45.132
It's okay.

01:26:45.134 --> 01:26:46.366
I'm not perfect.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:50.537
But, I mean,

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:53.373
it's not like you didn't know
what you were getting into.

01:26:53.776 --> 01:26:55.375
Yeah, I know.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:57.277
And I'm sorry.

01:26:57.913 --> 01:27:00.714
I'm trying to get over

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:03.483
the whole resentment thing.

01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:04.785
Working on it.

01:27:06.188 --> 01:27:07.221
I guess...

01:27:09.425 --> 01:27:11.592
Even when I was helping you,

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:14.094
and your marriage,
it made me feel worthy.

01:27:15.798 --> 01:27:17.297
And I guess, now that

01:27:17.299 --> 01:27:20.500
you're not married any more
I don't feel like

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:22.970
I have anything to offer.

01:27:25.541 --> 01:27:27.274
Is that really how you feel?

01:27:29.445 --> 01:27:30.744
Yeah.

01:27:35.384 --> 01:27:36.917
I didn't fall in love with you

01:27:36.919 --> 01:27:38.852
'cause you helped me leave Adam.

01:27:39.388 --> 01:27:41.021
Well, I'm sure that

01:27:41.023 --> 01:27:43.223
it had something
to do with it, right?

01:27:43.225 --> 01:27:44.258
Look at me.

01:27:45.561 --> 01:27:47.094
You are awesome.

01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:50.697
You are beautiful,

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:52.132
you're so smart,

01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:53.567
you're so funny,

01:27:53.569 --> 01:27:55.235
you're a really good brother...

01:27:56.739 --> 01:27:58.105
And you're

01:27:58.107 --> 01:28:00.173
like, really, my best friend.

01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:02.409
Yeah?

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:05.078
I don't know what I would have
done without you this year.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:08.515
Really?

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.053
I missed you so much.

01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:16.923
Yeah, I missed you.

01:28:55.097 --> 01:28:56.163
Hey!

01:28:56.598 --> 01:28:57.831
Hey!

01:28:58.133 --> 01:28:59.266
Oh, hey!

01:29:01.303 --> 01:29:02.402
This pizza?

01:29:02.404 --> 01:29:03.470
Yeah.

01:29:03.472 --> 01:29:04.604
He's cute.

01:29:04.606 --> 01:29:05.572
Thanks.

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:06.540
Yeah, he's pretty cute.

01:29:06.542 --> 01:29:08.809
He's also really heavy, though.

01:29:08.811 --> 01:29:10.243
Well, glad I bumped into you,

01:29:10.245 --> 01:29:13.013
because, remember
when I called you ugly?

01:29:13.315 --> 01:29:14.314
Yeah.

01:29:14.316 --> 01:29:15.482
Yeah, well,

01:29:15.484 --> 01:29:16.950
I'm sorry about that.

01:29:16.952 --> 01:29:19.453
I was thinking about it, and,

01:29:19.455 --> 01:29:22.122
look, you might not be
the prettiest girl,

01:29:22.124 --> 01:29:23.457
but you have a lot to offer.

01:29:23.459 --> 01:29:26.126
Okay, I don't really need
to talk about this.

01:29:26.128 --> 01:29:28.261
I feel we already
talked about this.

01:29:28.263 --> 01:29:29.863
All right, I'm trying
to apologize.

01:29:29.865 --> 01:29:31.465
Okay, what, I mean...

01:29:31.467 --> 01:29:32.733
Thank you,

01:29:32.735 --> 01:29:34.267
but if we're gonna hang out,

01:29:34.269 --> 01:29:37.137
you need to know
when to stop talking.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:40.374
So we're going
to be hanging out.

01:29:40.376 --> 01:29:41.708
Yeah.

01:29:41.710 --> 01:29:43.443
If your girlfriend doesn't mind.

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.446
I don't have a girlfriend.

01:29:46.448 --> 01:29:48.048
Really?

01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:50.650
Okay, you don't need
to rub it in.

01:29:50.652 --> 01:29:51.885
Just give me the dog.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.354
You got to watch out,
he's got a sore spot.

01:29:54.356 --> 01:29:56.890
No, pizza!

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:58.959
You all right?

01:29:58.961 --> 01:30:00.827
Okay. You okay, pizza?

01:30:00.829 --> 01:30:02.629
- Jinx.
- Jinx.

01:32:03.485 --> 01:32:05.018
Mm.

01:32:05.020 --> 01:32:07.320
We got to nurse you
back to life.

01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:13.460
It's working!

01:32:14.096 --> 01:32:16.229
Wow. It's so sharp.

01:32:19.635 --> 01:32:21.601
Thanks.

01:32:21.603 --> 01:32:24.137
Mm, don't mind if I do.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:26.773
Cut.
