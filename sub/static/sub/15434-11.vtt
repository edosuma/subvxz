WEBVTT

00:04.426 --> 00:05.320
He's gonna be OK.

00:05.413 --> 00:05.921
Really?

00:05.921 --> 00:07.973
I'm recommending the following rehab facilities.

00:08.124 --> 00:10.444
The army's still gonna buy the land for $30 mil, right?

00:10.444 --> 00:13.405
- As long as all the owners of the land sign off.
- OK.

00:13.593 --> 00:15.307
Holly Harper is one of the owners.

00:15.339 --> 00:20.128
- I'll sell you my share for half its value in cash.  
- And?

00:20.128 --> 00:23.751
I want the other half in Ojai Foods stock.

00:24.373 --> 00:25.293
No way.

00:25.314 --> 00:28.034
I could use somebody like you on 
my communications staff.

00:28.034 --> 00:31.669
- You're offering me a job on your staff?
- You got yourself a deal.

00:31.848 --> 00:33.261
You'll get a check for half in a month,

00:33.261 --> 00:36.245
and you'll be officially a 
shareholder in Ojai Foods.

00:36.515 --> 00:38.047
Welcome to the family business.

00:42.903 --> 00:45.757
The light within me salutes the light within you.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.075
With our awareness on our breath,

00:48.281 --> 00:50.988
let's slowly exhale.

00:52.348 --> 00:53.858
Namaste.

00:54.314 --> 00:55.715
Namaste.

00:59.047 --> 01:00.985
Wow, that was awesome, Maya.

01:00.985 --> 01:02.395
Seriously, I can hardly move,

01:02.395 --> 01:06.529
but somehow I'm completely energized.
- Thanks, Justin.  You're getting a lot stronger.

01:07.696 --> 01:09.520
Listen, I'm gonna get a mango smoothie.  You want one?

01:09.520 --> 01:12.845
- I'm buying.
- I'm allergic to mangoes.  They make my lips swell up.

01:12.982 --> 01:14.842
Well, we wouldn't want that.

01:17.559 --> 01:20.510
Um, what about a banana smoothie?

01:21.830 --> 01:25.239
Justin, I'm on staff here.  I can't date patients.

01:25.481 --> 01:27.687
- Doesn't have to be--
- Mr. Walker?  You have a visitor.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.697
- Oh!
- Only in California would a rehab look like this.

01:32.214 --> 01:35.242
Oh!  You know, when I came in, I think I saw that guy

01:35.242 --> 01:36.548
with the funny hair...

01:36.615 --> 01:38.472
You know, the one that hosts that reality show?

01:38.472 --> 01:39.901
But, what's his, uh, what's his name?

01:39.901 --> 01:42.207
The anonymity pledge prevents me from telling you his name.

01:42.207 --> 01:44.801
But, I will tell you this.  That's not his hair.

01:44.801 --> 01:48.070
Mmm.  So, how's it going?

01:48.114 --> 01:49.114
It's good.  I mean, they make me go to, like,

01:49.387 --> 01:51.946
four different kinds of therapy a day,

01:51.946 --> 01:53.769
and for the last three weeks, I've done nothing

01:53.769 --> 01:54.895
but talk about myself.

01:54.895 --> 01:56.747
So, as a matter of fact, I'm actually sick of me.

01:56.747 --> 01:59.695
How are you doing?  Is that senator still chasing you down

01:59.695 --> 02:03.464
to take that job?
- Mm-hmm.  He wants to meet and discuss it.

02:03.870 --> 02:06.701
But, you know, I'm just-- I'm not right for that.

02:06.701 --> 02:07.866
I mean, I think I'm just better

02:07.866 --> 02:10.470
at complaining about politicians than I am working for one.

02:11.256 --> 02:13.008
Yeah, but, like, isn't this your chance

02:13.008 --> 02:15.942
to sort of play the game instead of doing the color commentary?

02:16.631 --> 02:18.525
And he's good-looking, and he's Republican.

02:18.525 --> 02:23.967
- I don't know much, but I do know that is super rare.
- I don't know.  I just-- I can't figure out-- why me?

02:24.235 --> 02:27.875
- You're perfect for this job.
- I have zero experience in national politics.

02:27.875 --> 02:29.662
That didn't stand in the way of our president.

02:29.662 --> 02:31.564
- Oh, well, I'm not sure that he's your best example.
- Morning, Senator.

02:31.564 --> 02:32.708
You didn't spin the story

02:32.708 --> 02:34.600
about asking me to keep your brother out of Iraq.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.635
You took responsibility.

02:36.182 --> 02:39.924
- The party needs more honest people like you.
- Still, it doesn't make any sense.  Why me?

02:39.980 --> 02:41.107
You know, I'm beginning to think

02:41.107 --> 02:43.202
you have either alarmingly low self-esteem

02:43.202 --> 02:44.783
or you're relentlessssly fishing for compliments.

02:44.783 --> 02:47.876
- You can't possibly be that blind to your own value.  Thank you.

02:48.107 --> 02:50.514
We've talked twice-- once on-camera--

02:50.514 --> 02:51.915
for about probably 20 minutes.

02:51.982 --> 02:53.915
I don't even buy shoes without walking around

02:53.982 --> 02:57.380
in them longer than that.
- You see these shoes?  I bought 'em on the Internet,

02:57.381 --> 02:59.453
sight unseen, never had a problem.

02:59.715 --> 03:01.969
I'm a very good judge of quality, Miss Walker,

03:02.773 --> 03:04.397
and how things are gonna fit.

03:07.147 --> 03:10.480
Did you just compare me to ... shoes?

03:10.481 --> 03:11.606
You started it.

03:12.481 --> 03:16.253
The point is, you don't know me well enough to offer me

03:16.253 --> 03:17.650
the number two spot on your team.

03:17.748 --> 03:20.232
All right.  Come up to my place in Santa Barbara.

03:20.248 --> 03:22.755
I'll take a crash course in Kitty Walker.

03:22.755 --> 03:24.074
Right, and we'll start

03:24.074 --> 03:26.948
with how I don't date potential employers,

03:27.014 --> 03:29.214
especially those who are going through a divorce.

03:30.560 --> 03:32.709
Well, I think we just ruled out low self-esteem.

03:33.875 --> 03:34.805
You'll have lunch

03:34.821 --> 03:36.347
and a professional conversation.

03:36.548 --> 03:38.028
If you consider that a date,

03:38.028 --> 03:39.527
then your social life must be pretty lame.

03:41.448 --> 03:42.347
It is.

03:42.882 --> 03:43.954
That I can't help you with.

03:46.715 --> 03:49.729
- You can't be serious.
- Kevin, I didn't say that I was gonna take it.

03:49.729 --> 03:52.276
- I just said that I was considering it.
- Why you?

03:52.477 --> 03:53.922
Well, what the hell does that mean?

03:54.335 --> 03:55.844
Because it's completely absurd.

03:55.844 --> 03:59.794
- You can't work for this guy.
- Why? Why, Kevin?  Because he's a Republican?

03:59.794 --> 04:03.099
- No, because he's against gay marriage.
- There are lots of people in the world, Kevin,

04:03.099 --> 04:06.173
for instance, me, who have no problem with gay people,

04:06.173 --> 04:08.064
but still believe that marriage is fundamentally

04:08.640 --> 04:11.413
a religious institution that has nothing to do with the state,

04:11.414 --> 04:13.982
and that does not discount civil unions

04:13.982 --> 04:16.675
or domestic partnerships or anything that you--
- Oh, come on, Kitty.

04:16.675 --> 04:18.252
That's just a cover that people like you

04:18.252 --> 04:22.651
provide for people like him who hate people like me.
- Oh, Kevin, please.  Let's not make it personal.

04:22.985 --> 04:25.062
I'm s-- personal?

04:25.799 --> 04:26.775
Kitty, in ten years--

04:26.775 --> 04:29.743
in 20 years, when I'm finally mature enough

04:29.743 --> 04:31.093
to sustain a committed relationship,

04:31.093 --> 04:33.085
I would like to settle down and get married.

04:33.085 --> 04:34.867
- That's personal.
- That's improbable.

04:34.867 --> 04:36.663
Don't take this job, Kitty.  I'm warning you.

04:36.663 --> 04:38.786
- It'll cause a great deal of pr--
- Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  Wait a minute.

04:38.786 --> 04:41.693
- You're-- you are <i>warning</i> me?
- No, I'm just saying--

04:41.693 --> 04:43.874
Well, don't.  Don't say anything.

04:43.874 --> 04:45.707
Because I don't want to hear what you have to say.

04:48.014 --> 04:49.825
Kevin and Kitty had this huge fight,

04:49.825 --> 04:50.913
and they never fight, ever.

04:51.448 --> 04:53.886
You know, actually, uh, I met Senator McCallister once.

04:53.886 --> 04:55.866
He came to Afghanistan to talk to the troops.

04:55.866 --> 04:57.369
I mean, dude's like a war hero.

04:57.369 --> 04:59.566
Oh, well, Kevin says he's a political gay basher.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.038
Plus there's the nanny scandal.

05:01.038 --> 05:02.290
Personally, I think he's gorgeous,

05:02.290 --> 05:06.069
so it clouds my judgement.
- Well, you can always tell Kevin he put on an apron

05:06.069 --> 05:08.415
and cooked blueberry pancakes for the entire base.

05:08.415 --> 05:11.135
That might help.
- No, no, no.  You know what?  I'm staying out of it.

05:11.161 --> 05:14.517
- You know, I've got enough on my hands with Ojai.
- I thought you hit, like, paydirt.

05:14.517 --> 05:15.772
Yeah, we did, literally.

05:16.014 --> 05:17.976
The land's worth twice what Dad invested,

05:17.976 --> 05:19.714
but the dirt also pays Holly,

05:19.714 --> 05:21.607
and as one of the beneficiaries, she's suddenly rich.

05:21.615 --> 05:22.848
She put half back into the company --

05:22.848 --> 05:23.823
long story, dont ask--

05:23.823 --> 05:26.260
leaving her one of our larget single shareholders.

05:26.390 --> 05:28.077
She's coming in this afternoon, which should be

05:28.077 --> 05:29.639
about as much fun as a root canal.

05:29.639 --> 05:31.784
Oh, Honey, I gotta go.  You look good.  

05:31.784 --> 05:33.033
Hang in there, Babe.

05:45.963 --> 05:46.929
Check this out.

05:51.548 --> 05:54.214
All right, man.  Who is she?

05:59.015 --> 06:01.117
All right, let's go.  Let's pick it up.

06:02.281 --> 06:03.824
I want an office here at Ojai.

06:03.824 --> 06:06.175
I don't want to be a passive stockholder.

06:06.175 --> 06:08.625
I want to be a part of this company.

06:08.625 --> 06:10.864
Well, that's just not possible.

06:11.047 --> 06:13.101
You can vote at the stockholder meeting.

06:13.681 --> 06:16.410
Well, possibly I made a- a mistake.

06:16.410 --> 06:19.100
Um, maybe I should sell my stock.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.128
- OK.
- Yeah.

06:20.128 --> 06:21.712
- That might be the best. I hate to break this up, 

06:21.712 --> 06:22.568
but we have a meeting to go to.

06:22.568 --> 06:23.510
- Oh, yeah, that meeting.  
- Can we talk about this later?

06:23.510 --> 06:26.199
I think Westco Food might be interested

06:26.199 --> 06:28.679
in buying them, or one of your other competitors.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.287
And that would make your stockholder meetings

06:31.437 --> 06:32.963
pretty interesting.

06:43.720 --> 06:45.701
Why don't you tell us what you have in mind?

06:45.999 --> 06:50.531
- I have a number of projects that I have been considering.
- "Projects."  That's so cute.  It's adorable.

06:50.531 --> 06:52.714
It's not how business is done.  There's a process.

06:52.714 --> 06:53.352
Everything is vetted.

06:53.352 --> 06:55.671
Do you think it is possible for you to listen

06:55.671 --> 06:58.079
to anything I say objectively?

07:01.414 --> 07:04.280
Um, we'll find you an office.

07:05.114 --> 07:07.028
Just try to stay out of the way.

07:07.384 --> 07:08.934
She's <i>working</i> there?

07:10.365 --> 07:12.221
- I thought you knew.
- No.

07:13.120 --> 07:15.628
Everybody's coming here and telling me stuff, OK?

07:15.628 --> 07:17.473
It's--It's making me really tense.

07:17.473 --> 07:18.980
Don't. No, honey, honey, honey, honey, honey, don't.

07:18.980 --> 07:22.034
- Don't get tense.  I-- are they feeding you enough here?
- Ma, you know, I gotta go.

07:22.034 --> 07:25.942
- I'm gonna be late for arts and crafts.
- All right, all right, all right.  Love you!

07:25.942 --> 07:29.337
- It's not as if we have much choice, Nora.
- What's she planning on doing here?

07:29.337 --> 07:31.918
- We're not exactly sure.
- I want an office, too.

07:31.918 --> 07:36.169
- Mom, if you're trying to drive me crazy, I can walk from here.
- I can counteract her.

07:36.169 --> 07:40.150
- Who counteracts <i>you</i> ?
- Despite what you might think,

07:40.150 --> 07:42.412
in between changing your diapers and reading

07:42.412 --> 07:44.765
"The Velveteen Rabbit" 13,000 times,

07:44.765 --> 07:46.805
I actually helped your father build this company

07:46.805 --> 07:49.443
from a 200-acre farm to what it is today.

07:49.443 --> 07:52.066
I worked in budgeting and-and hiring.

07:52.066 --> 07:55.556
and-and a lot of other things.  It's like riding a bike.

07:55.556 --> 07:57.992
- Right off a cliff.
- Look, Nora, the situation

07:57.992 --> 07:59.161
is awkward enough for me without you--

07:59.161 --> 08:01.545
I look forward to seeing you both here tomorrow morning

08:01.545 --> 08:04.191
bright and early.
- Oh, someone accept my resignation, please.

08:04.191 --> 08:06.903
Oh, stop it, Saul.  If anyone's resigning, it's me.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.162
- Just take a breath.  
- You tell me what we're supposed to do

08:09.162 --> 08:11.490
and I'll decide whether I should breathe or not after that.

08:13.703 --> 08:15.688
We'll do exactly what they both want us to do.

08:17.053 --> 08:18.075
What does that mean?

08:18.604 --> 08:20.576
We'll give them enough rope to hang each other.

08:22.120 --> 08:28.795

<font color="#ffff00">Subtitled by J&J Subtitles, jeralvsut@hotmail.com</font>

08:42.611 --> 08:43.355
Good morning.

08:44.793 --> 08:47.373
I realize this is a bit awkward,

08:47.373 --> 08:49.813
but with the company in such a positive place,

08:49.813 --> 08:52.179
I figured it was time for me to step up to the plate.

08:53.602 --> 08:55.287
Have you decided...?

08:55.288 --> 08:57.414
Yes.  I'm going to be working here.

09:01.803 --> 09:05.449
Excuse me if I seem a little shocked.

09:05.449 --> 09:08.077
Just so you know, it was not my idea to double up,

09:08.077 --> 09:11.263
but we're so short on office space around here,

09:11.581 --> 09:13.654
Yeah, Sarah mentioned that.

09:15.046 --> 09:16.582
Well, shall we get to work?

09:26.362 --> 09:28.493
Yeah, it's very exciting.

09:29.872 --> 09:32.359
I am having the best time.

09:32.580 --> 09:33.947
I'm so glad.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.544
I took the liberty of bringing you a latte.

09:36.544 --> 09:37.480
Great. Great.

09:37.731 --> 09:39.850
OK, I'll get back to you at the end of business.

09:39.851 --> 09:42.172
Oh, Oh, OK.  I-I didn't--I...

09:42.172 --> 09:46.229
Wow.  They make those little headsets so tiny.

09:46.229 --> 09:47.905
I-I didn't know you were talking to somebody else.

09:47.910 --> 09:49.135
- Just vendors.
- Ah.

09:49.135 --> 09:51.918
- Thank you.
- It's non-fat, but don't be insulted.

09:51.944 --> 09:53.331
I just order out of habit.

09:53.331 --> 09:54.871
Very considerate of you.

09:54.871 --> 09:57.130
I like to stop and pick one up every morning.

09:57.130 --> 10:01.129
- If you would like, I would pick you up one, too.
- Yeah, only if you let me pay for yours.

10:01.129 --> 10:03.588
Oh, nonsense.  We'll start a coffee fund.

10:03.588 --> 10:06.890
That way, whoever's buying the coffee, they just...

10:08.815 --> 10:09.810
You look very busy.

10:09.860 --> 10:11.355
Just rolling calls.

10:11.355 --> 10:12.964
Oh, are you roll-- You're rolling calls.

10:13.010 --> 10:14.977
I gotta take this.

10:15.344 --> 10:16.840
- Holly Harper.  
- Have to take that.

10:16.840 --> 10:18.039
Hey, Paul!

10:18.040 --> 10:20.926
I feel like an idiot.  I have nothing to do.

10:20.926 --> 10:23.641
And I refuse to just sit there and watch her

10:23.641 --> 10:26.760
while she seems to be running a multinational corporation.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.926
- I'm just twiddling my thumbs.
- Well, I've gotta get to work.

10:29.926 --> 10:31.121
Tommy, why don't you sort it out?

10:31.121 --> 10:33.407
Find something for Mom to do with her thumbs.

10:41.976 --> 10:43.602
God, this office is drab.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.534
Hasn't anyone ever thought about hanging some curtains?

10:45.534 --> 10:46.494
- You want to be in charge of that?
- No.

10:48.502 --> 10:49.758
Nice try, though.

10:50.567 --> 10:53.537
OK.  OK, fine.  Do you know how to create invoices

10:53.537 --> 10:55.756
for the shipping department?
- I'll learn.

10:55.756 --> 10:58.196
All right.  Let's go.

11:00.379 --> 11:01.283
Hey, ho.

11:01.758 --> 11:05.019
- Hi, Mommy!
- Hey, Sweet Pea.  Thanks for walking the kids home, Gabe.

11:05.019 --> 11:05.943
No problem.

11:06.734 --> 11:07.852
Oh.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.969
Would you mind taking the trash cans out to the curb?

11:12.612 --> 11:13.369
Now?

11:13.847 --> 11:14.484
Please.

11:15.662 --> 11:16.332
All right.

11:18.082 --> 11:19.482
OK.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.400
Thanks, Babe.

11:22.738 --> 11:23.492
Uh-huh.

11:27.391 --> 11:29.020
- Paige?
- Yeah?

11:29.158 --> 11:30.790
Who opened this bottle?

11:31.937 --> 11:34.188
It's OK, you can tell me.  Was it Gabe?

11:36.538 --> 11:37.871
Oh, honey.  Run upstairs.

11:38.218 --> 11:40.174
I'll be right up to give you your shot.

11:42.413 --> 11:42.906
Gabe?

11:42.907 --> 11:43.688
Yeah?

11:48.004 --> 11:48.538
Where's the vodka?

11:50.867 --> 11:51.830
It's in my backpack.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.171
Get it.  Now.

12:05.504 --> 12:06.171
Thank you.

12:06.732 --> 12:08.596
I'm sorry.  I was just...

12:09.942 --> 12:12.859
I'm sorry, OK?  Just please don't tell my Dad, OK?

12:13.415 --> 12:14.218
Please.

12:15.466 --> 12:16.266
Please.

12:21.756 --> 12:22.627
Hey.

12:23.978 --> 12:25.807
What did you do, relocate your office?

12:25.926 --> 12:28.337
You accused me before of taking things too personally.

12:28.337 --> 12:30.234
So, I've compiled some research on McCallister's voting record.

12:30.234 --> 12:33.320
- Oh, my God, Kevin.  You are unbelievable.
- You know, I just thought we should talk about this.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.041
- You know what?  This is not talking.  This is litigating.
- I'm actually talking.  It would be nice if you listened.

12:38.493 --> 12:40.001
This reminds me of the time when you thought

12:40.001 --> 12:42.651
I stole your walkman, and you cross-examined me for an hour.

12:42.651 --> 12:46.540
- It wasn't a cross-examination.  You weren't under oath.
- Oh, that's right.  Lawyers are not made, they're born.

12:46.540 --> 12:48.925
OK, fine, Counselor.  Talk.

12:48.925 --> 12:50.981
This is a copy of the Republican-sponsored

12:50.981 --> 12:53.756
constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage,

12:53.756 --> 12:57.171
which your boss voted for.
- He's not my boss.  You know what?

12:57.171 --> 12:59.554
You and I have argued about these issues for years.

12:59.554 --> 13:01.303
We have agreed to disagree a hundred times.

13:01.303 --> 13:04.715
- You've never had a problem before.
- That's because before it was just rhetoric.

13:04.715 --> 13:08.166
No. No, it's never been "just rhetoric."

13:12.793 --> 13:15.459
You know, when people ask me,

13:15.526 --> 13:18.683
"How can you let your sister spew all that right-wing garbage

13:18.683 --> 13:20.371
on television and not disown her?"
- Oh, nice.

13:20.371 --> 13:22.455
I tell them it's because I know she loves me.

13:23.332 --> 13:24.768
I know she wants what's best for me

13:24.768 --> 13:26.275
and what's best for this country.

13:27.528 --> 13:29.714
But the day you start working for that guy,

13:29.714 --> 13:31.969
It's not about what you believe in anymore.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.783
It's about what he does,

13:34.162 --> 13:37.230
and there's not one single thing in all this legislation,

13:37.230 --> 13:39.235
all these speeches, that suggests he will do

13:39.235 --> 13:40.401
what's best for me.

13:41.394 --> 13:43.414
In fact, there's a lot of evidence to the contrary.

13:46.061 --> 13:47.223
All I'm asking...

13:48.528 --> 13:51.595
is that you consider that before saying "yes" to this offer.

13:51.595 --> 13:52.513
That's all.

13:55.967 --> 13:56.795
Fine.

13:58.326 --> 13:59.233
I will.

14:00.195 --> 14:00.986
Really?

14:01.461 --> 14:02.610
Mm-hmm, really.

14:03.215 --> 14:05.099
Well, you know, why is it that this family thinks

14:05.099 --> 14:08.156
that I am incapable of rational conversation?

14:08.156 --> 14:09.805
- Well--
- Uh, uh, mmm-hmm.

14:11.316 --> 14:12.622
Court is adjourned.

14:15.427 --> 14:17.474
I mean, you know, I think I got through to her,

14:17.474 --> 14:20.616
But I, I can't be sure.

14:20.616 --> 14:22.413
Has she said anything to you about McCallister?

14:25.849 --> 14:26.461
Are you not able to talk?

14:26.528 --> 14:28.795
Is this some kind of therapeutic exercise?

14:28.861 --> 14:31.960
- Would you like to pass me notes?
- Look, I'm not telling you anything, OK?

14:31.960 --> 14:33.348
Every time I open my mouth,

14:33.348 --> 14:35.323
someone in this family has a fight.

14:35.323 --> 14:36.855
Look, I need you to do me a favor, all right?

14:36.855 --> 14:39.834
Thursday is Family Day.  Spread the word.  You guys are up.

14:39.834 --> 14:42.663
- Up for what?
- I-it's part of group therapy, all right?

14:42.663 --> 14:43.575
They call on our families,

14:43.575 --> 14:47.530
- and you guys participate in group.
- And when you say "participate," you mean--

14:47.530 --> 14:50.069
I mean you share your feelings.  The-the whole family does.

14:50.069 --> 14:51.562
Have you told them about our--?

14:51.562 --> 14:54.317
I-I mean, <i>warned</i> them about our family?

14:54.883 --> 14:56.533
Hey, what if I bring back, like, just say two of us,

14:56.533 --> 14:59.291
- Me and Tommy?  
- No, look, it has to be everyone.  This is non-negotiable, Kevin.

14:59.291 --> 15:00.155
I need everyone there.

15:00.895 --> 15:05.144
OK. OK. I guess we could use a little therapy.

15:09.130 --> 15:11.444
Ojai Foods, always fresh.  Please hold on.

15:11.444 --> 15:14.176
Ojai Foods, always fresh.  Please hold on.

15:14.176 --> 15:18.505
Ojai Foods, may I help you?  I understand.

15:18.505 --> 15:21.271
You need accounting.  Oh, I'm sorry.

15:21.299 --> 15:24.546
I gave you the storage room.  Yes, please hold on.

15:25.004 --> 15:27.879
Sir, there is no need to shout,

15:27.879 --> 15:31.339
and there is certainly no need for you to shout so loudly.

15:31.339 --> 15:33.888
- Please hold on.
- Gladys, is there something wrong with the phones?

15:33.888 --> 15:36.947
- People aren't getting through.
- Yeah?

15:36.947 --> 15:38.759
- Ah. Well, this makes sense.
- I'm filling in.

15:38.759 --> 15:42.623
- Please, until Gladys gets back from the bathroom, right?
- Ojai Foods.

15:42.623 --> 15:43.908
Please hold on.  Ojai Foods, always fresh.  Please hold on.

15:43.908 --> 15:46.872
Uh, her son is playing in a basketball game today,

15:46.872 --> 15:49.494
very important game.
- He's 10.  How important can it be?

15:49.494 --> 15:50.258
Ojai Foods, always fresh.  Please hold on.

15:50.258 --> 15:52.617
Tommy, I'm surprised at you.

15:52.617 --> 15:57.177
- And you're gonna be a parent soon?  Ojai Foods.  What?
- Doug?  Doug!

15:57.177 --> 15:58.440
We could use a hand with the phones.

15:58.440 --> 15:59.896
Please hold on.  Oh, OK.

15:59.896 --> 16:03.551
Doug, listen to me.  If they start to shout, just hang up.

16:03.551 --> 16:06.220
There's no reason for you to put up with that kind of behavior.

16:06.220 --> 16:08.029
- Yeah.  
- Don't hang up on them, all right?

16:08.029 --> 16:09.469
Mom, the shipping department

16:09.470 --> 16:12.577
never got their invoices this morning.
- Well, I got a little backed up.

16:12.577 --> 16:16.085
- Well, just get 'em down there ASAP.
- Tommy, let me just tell you this--

16:16.085 --> 16:17.668
You could improve performance

16:17.668 --> 16:20.812
all around if you use the word "please" every now and then.

16:20.812 --> 16:22.171
Oh.  Yeah.

16:22.880 --> 16:24.861
Whoa!  What the hell is this?

16:24.861 --> 16:27.737
It's a puppy.  What a good puppy.

16:27.787 --> 16:29.550
Oh!

16:30.638 --> 16:32.472
Hi!  Ho, ho, ho, ho.

16:33.206 --> 16:35.014
I thought it might be nice

16:35.015 --> 16:37.554
if people brought their dogs to work occasionally.
- You -- nice?

16:37.555 --> 16:39.118
- I sent an email.
- You did <i>what</i> ?

16:39.119 --> 16:40.931
I read this wonderful study about it.

16:40.931 --> 16:43.703
It relaxes people, lowers blood pressure,

16:43.703 --> 16:47.514
not to mention depression.  Office productivity soars.

16:47.514 --> 16:50.006
Office productivity soars?  That's great.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.314
Doug!

16:51.655 --> 16:54.097
After my dad died, we gradually scaled back

16:54.097 --> 16:54.892
the cattle business.

16:54.892 --> 16:57.957
Now I just keep a few horses, and the kids have their ponies

16:57.957 --> 17:01.579
and ducks and rabbits and a goat named Millie.

17:01.579 --> 17:02.440
Are these your kids?

17:04.632 --> 17:06.580
Yeah.  That's Jack.

17:06.580 --> 17:09.795
He's 8, and Sophia, she's 10...going on 40.

17:11.002 --> 17:13.935
The kids haven't been out since Courtney filed for divorce,

17:13.935 --> 17:15.362
but I'm hoping they can come out soon.

17:15.621 --> 17:16.334
Oh, well, they're beautiful.

17:16.334 --> 17:17.273
Thank you.

17:19.555 --> 17:20.188
Here you go.

17:20.769 --> 17:21.688
Ah, thank you.

17:21.688 --> 17:25.078
All right.  You, uh, suggested that I was rash,

17:25.078 --> 17:26.780
that I wouldn't have offered you a job

17:26.780 --> 17:28.340
if I knew you better.
- You wouldn't.

17:28.340 --> 17:31.979
- What disqualifies you, apart from your lack of experience?
- Well, isn't that enough?

17:32.521 --> 17:33.465
Nope.

17:35.570 --> 17:37.778
Well, frankly, I just don't think I know you well enough

17:37.778 --> 17:39.564
to know that I want to work with you.

17:40.464 --> 17:41.679
Now we're getting somewhere.

17:41.679 --> 17:43.845
You know, I'm sorry.  Really, let me--

17:43.845 --> 17:48.517
- Let me just put that another way.
- Well, no.  It's -- you want to get to know me better.

17:49.211 --> 17:50.031
That's reasonable.

17:52.861 --> 17:53.929
What's the gun for?

17:53.929 --> 17:55.798
We're Republicans.  It's foreplay.

17:58.182 --> 17:58.991
I'm kidding.

18:00.312 --> 18:02.352
No.  We just need to her find a niche.

18:02.352 --> 18:04.463
But, uh, but in the basement behind locked doors?

18:05.182 --> 18:06.990
What's going on?  It's like a pound out there.

18:06.990 --> 18:10.925
- Oh, what, they don't allow dogs where you work?
- Are you kidding me?  They bite, Tommy.

18:10.925 --> 18:12.823
- It's a litigator's nightmare.
- It's Mom.  She's--

18:12.823 --> 18:15.555
- Come on, kids.  We're gonna be late for the board meeting.
- Did anyone notice

18:15.555 --> 18:18.267
how she made a board meeting sound like a trip to the zoo?

18:18.267 --> 18:20.717
Oh, speaking of family outings, tomorrow's Family Day

18:20.717 --> 18:22.365
at Justin's clinic.
- Family Day?

18:22.365 --> 18:23.826
Mmm, yeah.  It's a -- it's a group-sharing thing.

18:23.826 --> 18:26.326
Where you... share things in a group.

18:26.326 --> 18:28.169
- Anyway, he wants us all there.  
- Is he all right?

18:28.169 --> 18:29.185
This is not because he slipped?

18:29.185 --> 18:31.208
No, no.  He's fine.  They do this with all the families.

18:31.209 --> 18:33.567
- Hmm.  With <i>this</i> family?
- Well, now don't start.

18:33.567 --> 18:35.874
If your brother wants us there, then we're going to be there.

18:35.874 --> 18:39.873
- End of discussion.
- Hey, Mom, listen to me.  This is your first board meeting,

18:39.873 --> 18:42.557
So, just take it in, you know?  You don't have to say anything.

18:42.557 --> 18:47.696
- It's OK to be quiet.
- Why would I say anything?  Tommy.

18:49.070 --> 18:50.993
Let the record show that this board has heard

18:50.993 --> 18:53.664
from the Audit Committee, the Compliance Committee,

18:53.664 --> 18:56.345
and the Compensation Committee, and due to the fact that

18:56.345 --> 18:58.486
there's no more relevant business, the board holds--

18:58.486 --> 19:00.511
Excuse me.  If it's all right,

19:00.511 --> 19:03.785
- I would like to present something to the board. 
- Very well.

19:03.785 --> 19:07.401
The Chair recognizes shareholder Holly Harper.

19:07.401 --> 19:08.434
Thank you.

19:09.295 --> 19:12.613
First of all, I would like to thank everyone on the board

19:12.614 --> 19:13.836
for such a warm welcome.

19:15.015 --> 19:17.610
It means so much to me, being here today.

19:21.515 --> 19:24.660
If you could just take one, please,

19:24.660 --> 19:26.115
and then pass it on?

19:26.182 --> 19:30.445
It is my understanding that one of the goals

19:30.445 --> 19:32.888
of Ojai is new investments.

19:32.888 --> 19:35.205
As you will see, in this case,

19:35.205 --> 19:38.351
This is a vineyard called Greendale Vineyards.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.077
At its full capacity,

19:40.077 --> 19:44.015
the winery will produce 5,000 cases annually.

19:45.159 --> 19:46.445
Tim, if you will, please?

19:46.565 --> 19:48.924
Um, could you direct your attention, please?

19:51.368 --> 19:53.347
All right.  Hmm.

19:54.363 --> 19:56.127
Why do I get the feeling you've never touched a gun?

19:56.127 --> 19:58.484
Well, I've never served in the army,

19:58.484 --> 19:59.999
and I've never had to defend my house

19:59.999 --> 20:01.956
against an attack by soda cans.

20:01.956 --> 20:04.075
You might be surprised by how much you enjoy it.

20:05.226 --> 20:06.859
Here.  I'll show you.

20:06.859 --> 20:09.879
I used to watch my dad shoot when I was a kid,

20:09.879 --> 20:11.365
but he never let me touch his rifle.

20:13.461 --> 20:14.500
Oh, let's see.

20:16.290 --> 20:17.202
Right in here.

20:17.203 --> 20:17.743
Mmm.

20:18.392 --> 20:21.599
Right there, and just squeeze the trigger gently.

20:33.624 --> 20:36.324
He just gave me my own rifles to play with.

20:37.423 --> 20:39.477
I guess when you did my background check,

20:39.477 --> 20:41.103
my NRA membership didn't turn up.

20:41.103 --> 20:41.962
Apparently not.

20:42.475 --> 20:46.034
I'm also, uh, on a council to prevent handgun violence.

20:46.354 --> 20:47.088
So am I.

20:48.743 --> 20:49.718
What about immigration?

20:49.718 --> 20:51.252
All for it, as long as it's legal.

20:51.252 --> 20:54.062
Mm.  Family values?

20:54.062 --> 20:57.243
Against.  Families are ruining this country.

20:57.243 --> 20:59.608
Divorce is the bedrock of this great nation.

21:00.754 --> 21:04.151
That's funny.  What about gay marriage?

21:04.469 --> 21:05.292
Non-issue.

21:05.292 --> 21:08.923
Really?  Then why vote in favor for the ban on gay marriage?

21:08.923 --> 21:11.435
Because it was never gonna pass anyway,

21:11.435 --> 21:14.305
and I needed to do something to pacify leadership

21:14.305 --> 21:16.168
to get my education bill into committee.

21:16.731 --> 21:17.790
I see.

21:18.218 --> 21:21.145
I get it.  You don't want to work for a hypocrite.

21:22.195 --> 21:25.074
I vote for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage,

21:25.074 --> 21:26.740
and meanwhile, I can't keep my own marriage afloat.

21:26.740 --> 21:27.486
Is that what you think?

21:27.914 --> 21:28.652
No.

21:29.232 --> 21:33.466
My brother, whom I respect very much, is gay.

21:34.324 --> 21:35.416
That's what he thinks.

21:36.305 --> 21:38.273
He also thinks that you hate gay people.

21:38.274 --> 21:40.408
He's right about the vote.  I learned a tough lesson.

21:40.409 --> 21:41.156
I wouldn't do it again.

21:41.156 --> 21:46.076
But I'm not a hypocrite, and I don't hate gay people.

21:46.486 --> 21:49.091
As for my own marriage, my wife of 16 years,

21:49.091 --> 21:51.117
and the mother of my children, cheated on <i>me.</i>

21:52.208 --> 21:53.912
She accused me of cheating on her

21:53.912 --> 21:55.395
so she could get a better divorce settlement.

21:55.395 --> 21:58.240
- And she knows I won't fight it.
- Because you're a public figure?

21:58.240 --> 21:58.954
Because I'm a father,

21:59.822 --> 22:01.801
and airing our dirty laundry in the media,

22:01.801 --> 22:03.014
no matter how false the dirt is,

22:03.014 --> 22:04.271
is only gonna end up hurting the kids.

22:04.929 --> 22:06.666
And that's a situation that's gonna go on

22:06.666 --> 22:08.152
as long as I'm getting a divorce,

22:08.173 --> 22:09.656
and since that's being handled by divorce attorneys,

22:09.656 --> 22:10.529
that could be a while.

22:12.043 --> 22:13.313
I need someone on my staff

22:13.313 --> 22:14.565
who understands how the media thinks,

22:16.145 --> 22:19.411
someone who can help me deal with the endless gossip

22:20.146 --> 22:22.373
and innuendo that people are spinning as the truth.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.248
Know anybody?

22:28.389 --> 22:31.554
This is something that William Walker believed in.

22:31.554 --> 22:34.630
He felt very strongly that Ojai Foods

22:34.630 --> 22:36.890
should be in the winemaking business.

22:36.890 --> 22:39.997
So I hope that his wisdom survives

22:39.997 --> 22:42.275
in this board's decision.

22:43.333 --> 22:46.433
Yeah, thank you, Holly.  That's very impressive indeed,

22:46.433 --> 22:48.485
and we will give it a lot of serious thought.

22:48.485 --> 22:50.467
On that note, I would like to say--

22:50.467 --> 22:54.139
Saul, I, too would like to address the board.

22:54.139 --> 22:55.930
- You--you would?
- Yes.

22:57.172 --> 22:58.643
OK.  Of course, Nora.

22:59.205 --> 23:03.847
William and I <i>also</i> talked about many, many things

23:03.847 --> 23:05.378
when we were <i>married,</i>

23:06.614 --> 23:07.589
and I would like

23:07.589 --> 23:11.063
to share some of my thoughts with you.

23:19.762 --> 23:22.137
Oh--it was on "Oprah."

23:22.137 --> 23:24.040
I -- they have this avocado

23:24.040 --> 23:26.620
where they've taken the fat out of it.

23:26.620 --> 23:28.252
It's--it's a, uh...

23:29.612 --> 23:31.113
SlimCado.

23:31.137 --> 23:34.126
SlimCado! It's a SlimCado,

23:34.126 --> 23:36.291
and it's really very, very good.

23:36.291 --> 23:39.116
and I can't help but think

23:39.116 --> 23:41.724
that it might be a gold mine for us.

23:41.724 --> 23:45.857
I think we should consider seriously investing in it.

23:45.857 --> 23:48.395
What did I say before we went into that meeting?

23:48.395 --> 23:49.408
You told me not to speak.

23:49.408 --> 23:52.956
I told you not to speak.  Do-do you have any idea why?

23:52.956 --> 23:56.611
- Because you didn't want to be embarassed.
- Listen, Holly being here

23:56.611 --> 23:58.594
is the price of keeping this place afloat.

23:59.457 --> 24:01.007
Mom,  you--you're--

24:01.955 --> 24:03.589
you're just making things worse.

24:13.397 --> 24:17.687
Hey.  Am I running late for Justin's rehab confab?

24:17.687 --> 24:18.738
No, you've got time.

24:18.738 --> 24:21.982
I've been reading all these books on addiction for Justin.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.228
Yeah?  Learn anything?

24:23.228 --> 24:25.591
Yeah, that it's a mistake

24:25.591 --> 24:27.813
to overlook the early warning signs.

24:27.813 --> 24:30.684
Mmm.  You're about ten years too late for that.

24:30.684 --> 24:32.873
Yeah, not really.

24:32.873 --> 24:35.809
Listen, Joe, I--I screwed up with Gabe.

24:35.809 --> 24:39.138
- Why did yo do it, Gabe?
- 'Cause these guys were having a party, and I wanted to go.

24:39.138 --> 24:41.366
- It was stupid.
- Well, we're all in agreement there.

24:41.366 --> 24:44.109
- I'm sorry.
- We appreciate your apology, Gabe,

24:44.109 --> 24:46.290
but it's not gonna cut it, not by a long shot.

24:46.290 --> 24:49.351
We can't let you break the rules of this house,

24:49.351 --> 24:51.526
- not to mention the law.
- Break the law?  Are you kidding me?

24:51.526 --> 24:52.306
Wait a -- wait a second.

24:52.306 --> 24:54.323
Let's just chill for a second, OK?

24:54.324 --> 24:57.496
- It's not like she's gonna call the cops or anything.
- That's not what I meant, Joe.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.678
What I'm saying is that Gabe needs to realize

24:59.824 --> 25:03.305
there are lines he can't cross without facing the consequences.

25:03.305 --> 25:05.320
OK, fine.  Let's just not get carried away.

25:05.457 --> 25:08.943
- So, uh, Gabe, you go upstairs.  
- Joe, you're not helping him by ignoring this.

25:08.943 --> 25:11.682
Gabe, go upstairs.  I'll talk to you later.

25:14.420 --> 25:16.604
I can't believe you would undermine me

25:16.604 --> 25:17.780
in front of him like that.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.618
Oh, don't overreact.  It's not gonna help

25:19.618 --> 25:21.945
to come down on him like a ton of bricks right now.

25:21.945 --> 25:24.222
I know my own kid, Sarah.  I'll handle it later.

25:24.222 --> 25:26.402
This is so classic.  Don't you see it?

25:26.402 --> 25:29.007
First, he convinces me to team up against you,

25:29.007 --> 25:31.342
now he's got  you teamed up against me.

25:31.342 --> 25:32.682
OK, we got Justin's thing.

25:32.682 --> 25:34.995
Let's suspend the psychobabble until after I shower.

25:36.813 --> 25:38.473
I am trying to be a good mother to him.

25:38.473 --> 25:40.965
- I know that's what he wants when he's here.
- He has a mother.

25:40.965 --> 25:42.892
Yeah, but she's not here, is she, Joe?  And I am.

25:44.315 --> 25:46.671
You guys make me sick, OK?

25:46.671 --> 25:48.686
Just let me be who I am.

25:48.686 --> 25:49.868
I'm not like you.

25:49.868 --> 25:53.262
Why would <i>anyone</i> want to be like you?

25:53.262 --> 25:55.626
I mean, look at yourselves.  What's wrong with you, huh?

25:55.626 --> 25:59.198
- Or have you all had lobotomies?  
- Can we at least thank your family

25:59.198 --> 26:00.351
for coming here today, Claire?

26:02.783 --> 26:04.377
I would rather eat glass.

26:06.049 --> 26:07.319
All right, why don't we stop there?

26:09.448 --> 26:10.357
Poor kid.

26:10.457 --> 26:13.421
- Of course, I'd shoot you if you talked to me like that.
- What does that mean?

26:13.421 --> 26:18.266
- Justin, you want to come up now?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

26:18.266 --> 26:19.335
And bring your family, please.

26:19.335 --> 26:21.745
- Guys, that's you.
- OK.

26:21.745 --> 26:23.583
- Come on up.
- That's us.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.968
Everybody, sit down.  Where's Julia?

26:25.968 --> 26:27.454
Morning sickness, but it's all day.

26:27.455 --> 26:30.174
Ohh.  Well, Kitty, you come over here and sit next to me.

26:30.174 --> 26:32.033
- Kevin, you just stay down there and sit with your brother.
- Mom.

26:32.033 --> 26:33.620
- Yeah, thanks, Mom.
- OK.

26:33.621 --> 26:34.692
Why don't you introduce yourself

26:34.692 --> 26:35.730
to the rest of the families?

26:36.306 --> 26:40.959
Sure.  Uh, I'm Justin Walker, and uh, this is my family.

26:40.959 --> 26:42.058
- Hey.
- Hi.

26:42.059 --> 26:45.154
Thank you for coming.  All this is a really important part

26:45.154 --> 26:47.375
of Justin's recovery, and just you guys

26:47.375 --> 26:48.990
being here is a really healthy gesture.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.116
So, how are you feeling?

26:53.778 --> 26:55.740
Uh, totally weird.

26:57.093 --> 26:59.086
A little panicked, surrounded,

26:59.086 --> 27:00.049
but otherwise, great.

27:00.664 --> 27:02.719
Part of what this is about is accountability,

27:02.719 --> 27:04.646
which we talk a lot about here.

27:05.132 --> 27:07.567
So I think Justin has some things to say to you.

27:07.567 --> 27:08.298
Go ahead.

27:10.009 --> 27:12.133
Well, I'd like to apologize for some things--

27:12.133 --> 27:14.588
Um, a lot of things.

27:14.588 --> 27:16.476
It's OK.  We all love you so much.

27:16.476 --> 27:19.500
- Yeah, I'm the most lovable person in the world, Mom.
- That sounded cynical.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.276
If you're upset, tell your mom why you're upset.

27:23.884 --> 27:27.001
Look, I've done some things any human being would be ashamed of.

27:27.001 --> 27:28.644
and I know that's hard for you to believe, Mom,

27:28.644 --> 27:31.534
but in order for this to work, I need to make amends, OK?

27:31.534 --> 27:32.297
So just...

27:32.297 --> 27:35.822
OK.  But whatever you've done, it's fine.

27:35.822 --> 27:39.764
- I know you didn't mean it.
- Mom, just let him talk, please.

27:39.764 --> 27:43.709
- Who do you want to apologize to first, Justin?
- Uh, Kevin.

27:43.709 --> 27:47.662
Um, remember when we were cleaning out the attic

27:47.662 --> 27:49.116
after Dad died and you couldn't find

27:49.116 --> 27:51.219
your princess Leia "Star Wars" figure?

27:51.219 --> 27:53.178
You know, the one with the slave girl outfit?

27:55.039 --> 27:56.843
Well, yeah.  Yeah, I--yeah.  Why?

27:56.843 --> 28:00.942
- I stold it to the kid at the video store to buy drugs.
- What?  Justin, I had that since--

28:00.942 --> 28:02.876
that thing was in mint condition.

28:02.876 --> 28:05.447
It's in the original packaging.  It's worth $300 bucks.

28:05.447 --> 28:06.381
I sold it for $50.

28:07.489 --> 28:11.462
Well--well, w-why didn't you just ask me for the money?

28:11.462 --> 28:13.877
- What, to buy drugs, Kevin?
- Just accept his apology.

28:13.877 --> 28:15.414
Excuse me, I think this is his amends to me.

28:15.414 --> 28:16.854
I think you can talk when you get your own amends.

28:16.854 --> 28:18.924
Speaking of which, Kitty, I'm sorry that

28:18.924 --> 28:23.374
you had to find me half-dead.
- Well, I was there, too.  We found him together.

28:23.374 --> 28:24.219
Mom.

28:24.219 --> 28:25.838
Tommy, stop "Momming" me.

28:25.838 --> 28:28.025
If you had your way, I would never speak at all.

28:28.025 --> 28:30.421
- OK, easy.
- I'm--I'm sorry for that morning, OK?

28:30.822 --> 28:31.857
It's pretty much the worse thing I ever could have done

28:31.857 --> 28:34.291
to you guys, and I'm sorry.
- Sweetheart, you had just found out

28:34.291 --> 28:37.832
they were calling you back to the war.
- Look, I'm not asking for your forgiveness, Mom.

28:37.832 --> 28:40.291
- I just want you to understand that I know what I did, OK?
- OK.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.323
- Can I finish?
- Yes.

28:43.764 --> 28:46.021
Sarah and Joe, there was a time,

28:46.022 --> 28:47.827
uh, I don't know if you remember,

28:47.855 --> 28:49.408
I promised to babysit,

28:49.408 --> 28:51.783
and I called you and said my car had broken down.

28:51.783 --> 28:52.608
- Yeah.
- Right.

28:52.608 --> 28:54.395
- You were high.
- Yes.  I was in Vegas.

28:54.395 --> 28:58.475
- I could barely speak, so I can't believe the car story worked.
- I can.

28:58.475 --> 29:01.525
How did I become the problem here?

29:01.525 --> 29:03.669
Oh, don't worry.  I'm the one everybody's gonna blame.

29:03.669 --> 29:08.021
- Gabe is my kid.  Don't criticize how I parent him.
- He's my child, too, now, OK?  Wake up, Joe.

29:08.022 --> 29:11.421
- Look around.  Do you really want him here in five years?
- What's wrong with Gabe?

29:11.421 --> 29:14.315
- He got into the vodka this week, Mom.
- This is none of their business, Sarah.

29:14.315 --> 29:15.561
You know what?  When we were young,

29:15.561 --> 29:18.808
- We all did our share of experimentation, all of us.
- What are you saying,

29:18.808 --> 29:21.479
- that I just sat around while my children got sloshed?
- Mom.

29:22.055 --> 29:24.148
Tommy, we're not at work now.  You have to stop shushing me.

29:24.148 --> 29:26.938
You two need to stop arguing.  It's been going on all week.

29:26.938 --> 29:28.744
You put me in charge of her.  What did you expect?

29:28.744 --> 29:31.594
- To find her something to do, Tommy.
- I had no idea I was such a big burden,

29:31.594 --> 29:35.985
while your fathe'rs mistress is <i>such</i> a big asset.
- Look, look.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute, you guys.

29:35.985 --> 29:39.213
- We are here to talk to Justin.  
- So, yeah, come on.  Let's get on with it.

29:39.213 --> 29:41.692
- I'm sure Kitty's running late for her new job.
- Oh, Kevin.

29:41.692 --> 29:43.246
I didn't know it started till next week.

29:43.246 --> 29:45.366
I-I kn-- Oh, God, I knew it.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.853
- What happened to weighing it?
- I weighed it, and I took it.

29:47.853 --> 29:49.145
- Kitty, you took the job?
- I did.

29:49.145 --> 29:52.961
- Oh, congratulations!  He's so hot.
- Yeah, sure.  Congratulate her on helping strip me

29:52.961 --> 29:56.394
- of my constitutional rights as an American.
- You know what?  Marriage is not a constitutional right,

29:56.394 --> 29:58.449
and as you pointed out, maybe you'd better wait for a guy

29:58.449 --> 30:01.744
- who actually wants to marry you.
- Oh, well, maybe if I cheated on my fiance,

30:01.744 --> 30:03.188
and played musical chairs with my career,

30:03.188 --> 30:06.608
- I'd get a little more play.
- Oh, this is exactly what I was afraid would happen.

30:06.608 --> 30:09.490
- Really, they're usually much better behaved than this.
- Mom.

30:11.788 --> 30:12.014
- Stop "Momming" me, Tommy!
- Why don't you shut your mouth?

30:19.337 --> 30:20.497
Excuse me.  Hey.

30:20.497 --> 30:22.915
<i>Hey!</i> Come on!

30:24.291 --> 30:27.184
OK.  Well, I think it's clear

30:27.184 --> 30:28.761
what this family dynamic is all about.

30:31.599 --> 30:33.637
Justin, you wanna say something?

30:36.574 --> 30:37.959
Look, I love you guys very much,

30:37.959 --> 30:41.079
but I am so sick of all your problems.

30:42.126 --> 30:44.164
You guys are always fighting and arguing

30:44.164 --> 30:46.703
and makin' up with each other, and that's the way you like it.

30:46.981 --> 30:49.013
And you liked me because I was the one person

30:49.456 --> 30:51.235
you didn't fight with, you know?

30:51.235 --> 30:53.855
Because I was the cute one.  I always had a smile on,

30:53.855 --> 30:56.126
so you didn't see me like I really was.

30:56.126 --> 30:59.455
And, Tommy, you have lately, and I thank you for that.

31:01.523 --> 31:02.824
Look, if you guys love me,

31:02.824 --> 31:05.150
you'll just stop taking care of me.

31:05.150 --> 31:08.470
and you'll call me out on my crap, and then...

31:08.470 --> 31:11.307
and then we'll fight...

31:12.861 --> 31:14.718
the same way you guys fight.

31:36.650 --> 31:37.381
Good morning.

31:37.381 --> 31:38.177
Ohh.

31:38.177 --> 31:39.831
I have coffee.

31:44.748 --> 31:48.625
Kevin.  What are you doing here?

31:48.625 --> 31:50.659
I wanted to stop by on my way home from the gym.

31:50.659 --> 31:53.488
Why do you all you gay people work out so early?

31:53.488 --> 31:55.264
"All you gay people"?

31:58.486 --> 31:59.983
It's cause after 6:00, all the treadmills

31:59.983 --> 32:01.680
in front of the mirror are gone.

32:02.181 --> 32:06.231
- So can we talk about the job?
- I couldn't not take it because you didn't want me to.

32:06.231 --> 32:08.955
I--it--it's what I want, Kev.

32:08.955 --> 32:10.297
I'm not gonna argue with that.

32:11.053 --> 32:14.033
Wow.  This is working.

32:15.359 --> 32:17.930
Will you please just promise me one thing?

32:17.930 --> 32:18.991
Hmm?

32:18.991 --> 32:21.792
That you will argue with him every time he's wrong?

32:21.792 --> 32:22.798
I promise.

32:23.501 --> 32:24.383
Thank you.

32:25.556 --> 32:26.720
Go back to bed.

32:26.721 --> 32:29.872
I also promise to argue with you whenever you're wrong.

32:32.565 --> 32:33.568
- Wow.
- What?

32:33.568 --> 32:36.666
You--you--you really have been working out.

32:37.777 --> 32:38.998
Can-- can you really tell?

32:38.998 --> 32:41.117
Yeah, you-- you look good.

32:41.117 --> 32:43.070
I know I need to work my pecs a little more.

32:43.070 --> 32:45.521
It's not fair.  She's not my mother.

32:45.521 --> 32:47.000
Yes, she is.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.008
In this house, she is your mother,

32:49.008 --> 32:52.253
and I've seen for myself how fiercely she loves you.

32:52.254 --> 32:54.987
So, trust me, Pal, she is a lioness

32:54.988 --> 32:56.654
- protecting her cub.
- By what, grounding me?

32:56.721 --> 33:00.637
Yeah.  That is what <i>we</i> decided together.

33:04.120 --> 33:06.676
OK, Gabe, so for the next month,

33:06.676 --> 33:08.051
on the nights that you're here,

33:08.051 --> 33:11.836
no Internet, no iPod, and no television.

33:11.836 --> 33:13.188
Well, what the hell do you want me to do then?

33:13.188 --> 33:15.594
Um, you could try hanging out with us

33:15.594 --> 33:16.931
and your brother and your sister.

33:18.685 --> 33:22.114
Fine. Can I go now?

33:22.114 --> 33:23.069
Sure.

33:25.284 --> 33:27.733
I think I succeeded in making him hate me.

33:27.733 --> 33:30.801
Hey, he hates us both now.  You happy?

33:30.801 --> 33:31.691
No.  I need a drink.

33:32.415 --> 33:35.756
- You think there's any vodka left?
- Don't make me ground you.

33:41.273 --> 33:43.376
This is yours.  I switched to decaf.

33:43.376 --> 33:44.772
I got too jittery this week.

33:44.772 --> 33:47.875
Thank you.  What are you doing?

33:47.875 --> 33:49.846
I'm packing up my desk.

33:49.846 --> 33:52.350
Do you need any extra Post-its?

33:52.350 --> 33:53.941
Why are you leaving?

33:54.744 --> 33:56.447
I've had some bad ideas in my life,

33:56.447 --> 33:59.418
but thinking I could work here and share an office with you,

33:59.418 --> 34:00.985
is one of the worst -- no offense.

34:00.985 --> 34:01.768
None taken.

34:02.969 --> 34:06.153
I shouldn't have brought up William at the board meeting.

34:06.646 --> 34:10.159
It was insensitive and...

34:10.159 --> 34:11.091
passive-aggressive?

34:11.554 --> 34:13.315
I was very nervous,

34:13.315 --> 34:15.668
and it wasn't exactly a friendly audience.

34:16.791 --> 34:18.572
Anyway, I'm sorry.

34:20.647 --> 34:21.405
The truth is,

34:21.405 --> 34:25.418
you and I had very different relationships with...him.

34:25.418 --> 34:27.975
I'm not surprised he talked to you about his work.

34:29.646 --> 34:32.092
Well, it was all we <i>could</i> talk about.

34:33.005 --> 34:34.688
He kept his family private,

34:34.688 --> 34:37.033
and I -- I didn't really want to know anyway.

34:38.108 --> 34:40.614
But being here, around all these Walkers,

34:40.614 --> 34:42.908
watching you all together, well...

34:42.908 --> 34:45.290
I never had that--a family.

34:46.802 --> 34:51.288
You always want what you can't have, I guess.

34:51.524 --> 34:54.230
Isn't that funny?  I never did.

34:56.177 --> 34:58.008
Well, that's about it.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.981
Really didn't accumulate too much.

35:01.858 --> 35:03.348
I really want to wish you luck.

35:03.348 --> 35:05.138
You obviously have a knack for this.

35:06.016 --> 35:08.652
I'm just, uh, an old working girl

35:08.652 --> 35:10.145
who seems to have gotten lucky.

35:10.911 --> 35:12.709
I thought all you actresses had it easy.

35:12.709 --> 35:15.428
You have assistants to do all the mundane things for you.

35:15.428 --> 35:16.487
Assistants?

35:17.381 --> 35:20.752
I was practically unemployable in Hollywood.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.608
I went from temp job to temp job.

35:22.608 --> 35:24.234
How do you think I learned how to type?

35:25.729 --> 35:28.058
I really don't know the first thing about you, do I?

35:28.058 --> 35:31.340
Well, who knows?

35:31.340 --> 35:34.071
Maybe we'll be friends someday.

35:34.578 --> 35:35.861
Maybe.

35:37.913 --> 35:38.916
But not today.

35:48.120 --> 35:49.304
Mom, where are you going?

35:49.304 --> 35:52.975
- Wait, wait.
- You can't boss me around anymore.

35:52.975 --> 35:55.279
I'm totally useless here.

35:55.279 --> 35:56.616
I know that.  But you know what?

35:57.317 --> 35:58.507
It wasn't always that way.

35:59.415 --> 36:01.577
I was once an executive secretary.

36:01.577 --> 36:02.701
You were?

36:02.701 --> 36:05.489
Yes, I was, to a wonderful man, Mr. Stanley Elliott.

36:05.489 --> 36:08.089
He was the president of a big manufacturing company.

36:08.089 --> 36:09.342
He used to say to me every day,

36:09.342 --> 36:11.499
"Nora, one day you're gonna run this place."

36:11.499 --> 36:13.423
- and he meant it.
- What happened?

36:14.254 --> 36:16.626
Sarah was born, and then Kitty and you

36:16.626 --> 36:19.416
and Kevin and, and last but not least, Justin.

36:19.416 --> 36:21.235
You don't have any regrets, do you?

36:21.235 --> 36:25.274
- Well, I should have, the way you guys treat me!
- Mom.

36:25.274 --> 36:26.555
No. No.

36:28.566 --> 36:29.503
No.

36:30.850 --> 36:34.214
But, Tommy, you know, I read Mr. Elliott's obituary

36:34.214 --> 36:36.047
in the "Times" not too long ago,

36:36.047 --> 36:37.720
and I felt so sad, because I realized,

36:37.720 --> 36:41.139
there wasn't anybody left who knew me the way I was then,

36:41.139 --> 36:42.041
the way he knew me,

36:43.298 --> 36:45.738
Whatever else I could have been in this life,

36:45.738 --> 36:47.632
was buried with Old Stanley.

36:49.903 --> 36:51.049
I made my choices.

36:51.049 --> 36:53.682
I just forgot for a minute they were the right choices.

36:54.525 --> 36:55.383
I've gotta go.

36:56.860 --> 36:57.792
One more thing,

36:59.230 --> 37:03.443
Ojai should buy that vineyard.  It's obviously a very good deal.

37:11.409 --> 37:12.616
Would you excuse me for a  minute?

37:13.419 --> 37:14.648
I've got the L.A. Times on the phone.

37:14.648 --> 37:15.275
They want to know

37:15.275 --> 37:17.157
why I want to keep my divorce proceedings sealed.

37:17.918 --> 37:18.780
Got any ideas?

37:21.246 --> 37:22.871
Hi, this is Kitty Walker.  Who's this?

37:23.640 --> 37:27.666
Benny, Hi.  How you doing? No. No, I work here now.

37:27.666 --> 37:30.223
No, I'm not kidding.

37:31.460 --> 37:33.850
Listen, about those, uh, divorce proceedings,

37:33.850 --> 37:35.512
I'm gonna call you back tomorrow with a full statement.

37:37.150 --> 37:38.378
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

37:43.247 --> 37:44.424
Good morning, Senator.

37:44.807 --> 37:46.305
Good morning, Miss Walker.

37:49.365 --> 37:50.181
Oh, um.

37:50.885 --> 37:53.875
What full statement were you referring to just now?

37:53.875 --> 37:55.110
The one that I'll be writing today

37:55.110 --> 37:56.881
as your new communications director.

37:57.344 --> 37:59.686
You know, the one where you tell the truth about your divorce,

37:59.686 --> 38:03.579
about how you never had sexual relations with that nanny.
- You're kidding.

38:03.579 --> 38:05.765
Mm-hmm.  Every time you hold back,

38:05.765 --> 38:07.499
or try to conceal something,

38:07.499 --> 38:08.945
you're just giving them another story.

38:09.362 --> 38:11.189
The story is Senator McCallister

38:11.189 --> 38:13.617
is still concealing something from his constituents.

38:13.617 --> 38:16.444
You are going to have a chronic, incurable character problem

38:16.444 --> 38:17.878
that will follow you into your next campaign

38:17.878 --> 38:19.261
unless you tell the truth now.

38:19.261 --> 38:23.814
And, yes, there will be a fair amount of unpleasantness,

38:23.814 --> 38:25.281
But I'll be here to get you through it.

38:25.281 --> 38:29.444
- That's my job.
- And how will my kids get through it?

38:30.558 --> 38:32.890
Well, that's <i>your</i> job.

38:34.452 --> 38:35.460
And your brother?

38:36.356 --> 38:38.504
Is he OK with  you working here?

38:39.238 --> 38:40.078
He'll survive.

38:40.452 --> 38:41.443
Just don't go voting

38:41.443 --> 38:44.017
for any more constitutional amendments to ban gay marriage.

38:44.017 --> 38:44.496
Don't worry.

38:44.496 --> 38:46.259
My own brother wouldn't let me do that ever again.

38:46.830 --> 38:48.811
Wait, wait a minute.  You have a gay brother?

38:49.363 --> 38:51.983
Yeah, and a cute one, too.

38:52.385 --> 38:54.663
Well, why didn't you tell me that when we were--

38:54.663 --> 38:57.194
My brother's sexual orientation doesn't usually come up

38:57.194 --> 38:58.251
in a job interview.

38:58.251 --> 39:00.169
But you're, you know, a staffer now.

39:00.169 --> 39:02.000
Well, is he single?

39:02.000 --> 39:04.638
Kitty, do you want both of our brothers to kill you?

39:06.411 --> 39:07.135
Hmm.

39:07.136 --> 39:08.948
I got this towel when you guys were still married.

39:09.997 --> 39:11.524
The lead singer of the Rotting Monkeys

39:11.524 --> 39:13.016
threw it in the audience, and I caught it.

39:13.925 --> 39:15.350
It smells like ass.

39:15.350 --> 39:17.907
but it reminds me of when we all used to be a family.

39:18.335 --> 39:19.635
I love this towel.

39:23.344 --> 39:24.799
Thanks for sharing, Claire.

39:25.313 --> 39:26.163
That was great.

39:30.777 --> 39:33.110
OK, Justin, you want to come up now?

39:33.610 --> 39:36.276
Why does he always have to follow her?  It's not fair.

39:36.276 --> 39:38.556
Whew.  Hello.

39:39.192 --> 39:42.459
Um, I was supposed to think of something

39:42.459 --> 39:46.858
that would help me stay clean, so, uh, this is it.

39:48.756 --> 39:51.265
My mom sent me, uh, this tape when I was in Afghanistan.

39:53.656 --> 39:55.226
They say when you're a drug addict,

39:55.226 --> 39:56.417
you're supposed to think of something

39:56.417 --> 39:57.610
that you want to live for.

39:57.610 --> 40:01.199
um, and I've thought a lot about that,

40:01.877 --> 40:03.882
back then, too, and, uh,

40:05.345 --> 40:06.758
The thing I live for is,

40:08.290 --> 40:09.806
is my family.

40:09.806 --> 40:12.838
They kind of had a bad day here yesterday.

40:13.342 --> 40:15.091
That's not really who they are.

40:17.763 --> 40:19.839
This... this is who they are.

40:25.921 --> 40:27.152
<font color="#ffff00">Hi, Sweetie.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">How are you?</font>

40:27.643 --> 40:29.881
<font color="#ffff00">I was gonna write you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">another email,</font>

40:29.881 --> 40:32.509
<font color="#ffff00">but Mrs. Silver told me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that I should send a tape,</font>

40:32.946 --> 40:34.502
<font color="#ffff00">which I thought</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was such a good idea.</font>

40:34.632 --> 40:36.584
<font color="#ffff00">Not as high tech,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but you get to hear my voice.</font>

40:37.228 --> 40:40.212
<font color="#ffff00">Lucky you.  Actually,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I have some amazing news,</font>

40:40.394 --> 40:42.028
<font color="#ffff00">So let me lead off with that.</font>

40:42.381 --> 40:44.354
<font color="#ffff00">Joe and Sarah</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are pregnant again.</font>

40:44.379 --> 40:45.803
<font color="#ffff00">She just told me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">two nights ago.</font>

40:45.803 --> 40:48.383
<font color="#ffff00">Can you believe it?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I really can't think</font>

40:48.383 --> 40:50.165
<font color="#ffff00">of a better mother</font>
<font color="#ffff00">than your sister,</font>

40:50.165 --> 40:51.555
<font color="#ffff00">and she works.</font>

40:51.555 --> 40:54.154
<font color="#ffff00">She's like this supermom.</font>

40:54.154 --> 40:58.117
<font color="#ffff00">Tommy, Mr. Newlywed,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">is doing so well at Ojai,</font>

40:58.117 --> 41:01.049
<font color="#ffff00">Dad's giving him more</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and more responsibility.</font>

41:01.049 --> 41:02.524
<font color="#ffff00">It's a family business,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">after all.</font>

41:02.524 --> 41:07.169
<font color="#ffff00">And speaking of work, Kevin is</font>
<font color="#ffff00">doing much too much of it.</font>

41:08.130 --> 41:09.831
<font color="#ffff00">I wish he'd take some time off.</font>

41:09.831 --> 41:14.572
<font color="#ffff00">But he--he is going to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the gay pride parade this year.</font>

41:14.680 --> 41:16.753
<font color="#ffff00">He won't let me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">go with him, though,</font>

41:16.753 --> 41:19.050
<font color="#ffff00">which I...</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I guess I understand.</font>

41:19.685 --> 41:21.481
<font color="#ffff00">Kitty's back in New York.</font>

41:22.347 --> 41:24.416
<font color="#ffff00">I listen to her radio show</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from time to time.</font>

41:24.416 --> 41:25.990
<font color="#ffff00">I don't agree</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with a word she says,</font>

41:25.990 --> 41:29.305
<font color="#ffff00">but it's so nice</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to hear her voice.</font>

41:30.514 --> 41:32.369
<font color="#ffff00">and your dad</font>
<font color="#ffff00">couldn't be better.</font>

41:32.369 --> 41:34.812
<font color="#ffff00">He carries your picture</font>
<font color="#ffff00">everywhere he goes.</font>

41:35.389 --> 41:37.729
<font color="#ffff00">You can't imagine</font>
<font color="#ffff00">how proud he is of you.</font>

41:38.944 --> 41:42.478
<font color="#ffff00">We all miss you beyond words,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">my sweet boy.</font>

41:42.944 --> 41:44.419
<font color="#ffff00">You're my light.</font>

41:46.384 --> 41:49.072
<font color="#ffff00">I know what you're doing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">takes so much courage.</font>

41:50.600 --> 41:52.603
<font color="#ffff00">Please come home</font>
<font color="#ffff00">as soon as you can.</font>

41:52.984 --> 41:55.739
<font color="#ffff00">Life is so much less</font>
<font color="#ffff00">without you.</font>

41:56.603 --> 42:04.738
<font color="#ffff00">Brothers & Sisters, 1x11, January 7, 2007</font>

42:05.305 --> 42:11.878
