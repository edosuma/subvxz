WEBVTT

00:08.258 --> 00:09.134
[footsteps]

00:09.259 --> 00:11.302
-Morning, babe.
-Hey! Morning.

00:11.386 --> 00:13.847
I got a surprise for you
to celebrate the big sale.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.764
Oh!

00:15.140 --> 00:16.891
I made pancakes
in the shapes of little cows.

00:19.853 --> 00:23.773
I had more but Peyton started cryin'
and I lost half the herd to a grease fire.

00:26.776 --> 00:29.279
Selling them cattle,
that's all I thought about all night.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.698
Couldn't sleep, just... excited.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.199
[Abby chuckles]

00:33.825 --> 00:37.162
Oh, come on, you put chocolate chips
in here to make the little spots?

00:37.245 --> 00:38.288
-Actually, those are--
-Argh!

00:38.371 --> 00:39.748
Blueberries.

00:40.665 --> 00:41.583
Sick!

00:42.709 --> 00:43.752
Okay, there are...

00:44.586 --> 00:45.712
other good berries

00:45.795 --> 00:48.923
besides Frankenberries
and Cap'n Crunch Berries.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.552
Yeah, like "Halle Berry."

00:55.180 --> 00:57.932
Yeah, well, if she was here
I wouldn't be cookin' you breakfast.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.685
Guess who I'm havin' lunch with?

01:00.769 --> 01:01.853
-Who's that?
-Libby Williams.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.898
-Huh?
-Y'know, the teacher I used to work with.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.777
Glasses, brunette.
Organized my baby shower.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.905
-Big boobs.
-[Colt] Arrrh.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.491
Oh, Libby, right.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.035
Woo wee!

01:17.118 --> 01:19.204
I mean, she's gross, right?
'Cause of them...

01:23.458 --> 01:25.043
I'm gonna have my mom watch Peyton.

01:25.126 --> 01:27.462
Which reminds me,
we need to put child locks

01:27.545 --> 01:29.547
and grandma locks
on the liquor cabinet.

01:29.631 --> 01:30.590
[Colt] Yeah.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.385
Oh, hey, Mr. Bennett.

01:34.469 --> 01:36.471
Here, help yourself to some cow pancakes.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.643
Your heifers got some dark spots on 'em.

01:43.561 --> 01:45.105
Kinda looks like gut rot.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.399
They're blueberries.

01:48.608 --> 01:50.568
Urgh. Worse than gut rot.

01:53.238 --> 01:56.950
Lisa Neumann's men are gonna start
hauling my cows outta here today.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.911
So, you'll see some trucks
comin' and goin'.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.955
Are they coming
to pick up your cattle, too?

02:02.038 --> 02:02.956
What?

02:03.873 --> 02:04.707
Oh. Er...

02:04.874 --> 02:07.544
No, my dad made the deal first so...

02:07.627 --> 02:08.753
it's probably...

02:08.837 --> 02:10.380
-[Peyton starts to cry]
-Oh.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.257
Sounds like someone's hungry.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.383
-Oww!
-[Peyton cries]

02:13.633 --> 02:14.467
Shhh.

02:15.176 --> 02:17.470
Oh... don't cry.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.681
Save that for Grandma later.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.853
You sold your cattle to Lisa Neumann?

02:25.395 --> 02:26.312
Yep.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.689
Really?

02:31.025 --> 02:32.735
D'you really care? Yeah.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.446
Eight hours ago
you told me you were outta options.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.660
Now you're telling me that somehow you
made a deal in the middle of the night?

02:42.662 --> 02:43.746
There's no deal.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.458
I just told Abby there was,
so she wouldn't worry.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.793
You lied to her?

02:50.503 --> 02:53.464
How's that gonna work when she looks
out and sees they're still there?

02:54.424 --> 02:56.050
You gonna paint stripes on 'em,

02:56.134 --> 02:58.261
tell her zebras wandered in?

03:03.308 --> 03:04.267
I got a plan.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.353
Frank's comin' by tomorrow.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.647
I'm gonna accept his offer.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.941
It's the best I got.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.736
I'm gonna throw in ten or 15 heifers
to make up the money I'm short.

03:14.819 --> 03:16.571
Jesus Christ, Colt.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.073
You know selling heifers is a bad idea.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.241
Yeah, well...

03:21.826 --> 03:23.203
It'll get me through the year.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.081
Thanks to you,
it's the best option I got.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.042
Unless I find a finger in my Big Mac.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.633
And that's out, 'cause my friend Chance
got fired from the morgue

03:36.716 --> 03:38.384
for giving out too many fingers.

03:44.557 --> 03:48.686
If you get rid of your breeding stock,
you'll have fewer cows to sell next year.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.271
You don't think I know that?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.108
I gotta do what I gotta do
to keep my ranch going.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.986
I'll worry about next year
when I get there.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.948
Just trying to give you some advice.

04:01.658 --> 04:02.700
Now you wanna help?

04:04.535 --> 04:06.537
Last night, you made it pretty clear
you didn't.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.458
Why don't you just stay out of it,
old man?

-Hey.
-Hey.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.882
How you feelin'?

05:42.633 --> 05:44.594
Well, I feel like Evel Knievel did

05:44.677 --> 05:47.764
when he tried to jump ten buses,
came up short, and caught on fire.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.265
[she chuckles]

05:50.475 --> 05:54.062
Yeah, last night was like one of those
Fast and the Furious  movies.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.314
-Mm-hm.
-I remember the car chase scene,

05:56.397 --> 05:58.316
I just don't remember
how we got there or why.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.359
[Luke] Mm-hm.

05:59.942 --> 06:05.239
[sighs] Did we have a Percocet
out of a Easter Bunny Pez dispenser?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.075
-Uh-huh. [chuckles]
-Mm.

06:07.492 --> 06:10.495
I should probably empty that out
before I give it back to my grandkid.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.664
Hey, erm...

06:13.748 --> 06:15.958
can I ask you kind of an awkward question?

06:17.168 --> 06:20.088
-Oh, no. Did I cry after we did it?
-Mm-hm.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.298
No, erm...

06:22.965 --> 06:25.510
I'm sure we probably told each other
at some point, but, erm...

06:26.177 --> 06:27.220
[giggles] what's your name?

06:27.970 --> 06:28.846
Burt Reynolds.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.057
-[laughing] I like your style.
-[laughs]

06:31.682 --> 06:33.142
Luke Matthews.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.436
Mary. I'm Mary Roth.

06:37.313 --> 06:38.398
So, Luke...

06:38.898 --> 06:40.400
How come I haven't seen you around?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.235
You don't live here, do you?

06:42.318 --> 06:43.736
In this house?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.530
No, I was hoping you did.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.074
[chuckles] Yeah, this is my house.

06:49.158 --> 06:50.868
The bank thinks it's their house.

06:50.952 --> 06:52.620
Keep tryin' to garnish my wages, but...

06:53.079 --> 06:55.164
[laughs] joke's on them
'cause I don't have a job.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.168
Percocet?

06:59.752 --> 07:00.586
Mm.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.464
-Thank you.
-Uh-huh.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.717
I know where I'm coming
on Halloween next year.

07:06.926 --> 07:07.760
[Mary chuckles]

07:09.387 --> 07:12.390
You haven't seen me around
because I'm new to town.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.976
-Y'know, like a drifter.
-[chuckles]

07:15.059 --> 07:17.937
Just here seeing my family.
You know the Bennetts?

07:18.938 --> 07:20.106
Are you messing with me?

07:20.481 --> 07:23.860
No. My uncle's Beau Bennett.
D'you know him?

07:24.902 --> 07:28.072
-[sighs] Oh, Jesus Christ.
-What?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.907
-Oh, God.
-What, what, what, what?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.367
-You gotta go.
-Wha--

07:31.451 --> 07:33.327
Just get the fuck outta my house.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.287
What?

07:35.663 --> 07:37.290
We're not related, are we?

07:38.791 --> 07:41.085
Oh, my God,
did I have sex with my cousin again?

07:48.634 --> 07:49.886
This is cheese.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.598
And crackers.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.268
It would pair perfectly with a Riesling.

07:58.561 --> 08:01.606
A dry and fruity afternoon wine

08:01.689 --> 08:05.860
that Mommy says Grandma can't drink
while she's babysitting anymore.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.116
Peyton, this is Bud Light.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.744
It gives you superpowers.

08:16.287 --> 08:19.707
If you drink enough of it,
you think you can beat up anybody.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.752
-Hey, Colt.
-Hey.

08:23.461 --> 08:25.421
I hear congratulations are in order.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.008
Abby tells me you sold your herd
to Lisa Neumann.

08:29.091 --> 08:31.844
Oh, yeah. She told you, too, huh?

08:32.929 --> 08:33.804
Great.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.265
Listen, erm...

08:36.849 --> 08:38.392
can we talk about something
for a minute?

08:39.477 --> 08:40.394
You know what? No.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.608
The last time you said you wanted to talk,
you told me to tell Abby

08:45.691 --> 08:47.693
that she needed to style her hair
more often.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.820
That conversation did not go well for me.

08:52.865 --> 08:53.824
No...

08:55.952 --> 08:57.411
This is a little awkward.

08:58.955 --> 09:00.790
Things are slow at the dealership.

09:01.582 --> 09:04.669
Neumann's Hill signed a deal
with Caterpillar

09:04.752 --> 09:07.255
so they're not buying tractors
from us anymore.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.965
Chuck is a little stressed, so...

09:10.132 --> 09:11.801
I'm a little stressed.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.721
Actually, since you're here now...

09:23.813 --> 09:26.190
You would have been fun
to know in college.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.860
Oh, you have no idea.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.196
Tri Delts.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.993
Anyway, the reason
I bring all this up is that...

09:38.327 --> 09:40.788
I'm gonna need that money back
that I loaned you.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.623
Of course.

09:42.707 --> 09:44.917
Actually, I'm gonna join you here.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.725
Oh, good, the only one without a bottle
in their hand is Peyton.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.644
Hi, sweetie.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.731
Peyton was an absolute angel.

10:07.523 --> 10:09.567
And look, you put her in all pink.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.029
Well, I was afraid
people would think she's a boy,

10:13.112 --> 10:15.114
especially given the way
you do her hair.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.119
Her hair is fine,
and so is mine, by the way.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.831
Well, fine.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.916
No pink, no wine.

10:26.917 --> 10:30.338
Didn't realize I was babysitting
in North Korea.

10:42.266 --> 10:43.267
How was your lunch?

10:43.351 --> 10:44.393
Oh, it was great.

10:45.019 --> 10:48.397
Oh, and Libby says congratulations
on selling the herd.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.398
[Colt scoffs]

10:49.649 --> 10:51.734
You told her, too. Fantastic.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.612
Ah. She also had some...

10:55.529 --> 10:56.530
big news.

10:57.531 --> 11:00.868
Do you remember Mrs. Wilson,
that old, crazy lady,

11:01.619 --> 11:03.454
one of the history teachers at Garrison?

11:03.537 --> 11:05.206
Oh, yeah.

11:05.289 --> 11:06.290
I hated her.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.335
She smelled like cat litter.
Never owned a cat, though.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.048
Yeah, well, she smells worse now.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.216
She's dead.

11:16.759 --> 11:19.762
Anyway, she transferred to Norwood High
and now they have an opening

11:19.845 --> 11:21.430
and they want me to interview.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.557
Holy shit, really?

11:23.641 --> 11:27.269
Yeah, I know I said I was gonna take some
more time off to stay home with Peyton,

11:27.353 --> 11:30.064
but a teaching job this close
may not come around again.

11:30.147 --> 11:32.858
It took 128 years for Miss Wilson to die.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.197
I didn't commit to anything

11:38.280 --> 11:40.199
'cause I wanted to talk to you first.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.450
-You should take it.
-Really?

11:41.534 --> 11:42.827
I didn't think you'd be into it.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.453
[talks nonsense]

11:46.956 --> 11:48.249
Of course.

11:48.332 --> 11:51.043
Well, I want whatever you want,
whatever makes you happy.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.003
Yeah, I mean, if I get this job,

11:53.087 --> 11:55.214
Mama can get a new minivan, y'know?

11:55.297 --> 11:57.591
And if Beer Pong can get us
that bogus handicap placard,

11:57.675 --> 11:58.884
we'll be all set.

12:03.305 --> 12:04.140
[door knocks]

12:05.349 --> 12:06.267
Yeah.

12:08.436 --> 12:09.353
Hey.

12:10.771 --> 12:11.772
-Oh.
-Hi.

12:12.481 --> 12:13.441
Hey.

12:14.608 --> 12:16.110
Come to throw me out of here, too?

12:16.819 --> 12:18.571
This is my house.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.407
Well, my Uncle Beau's house.

12:22.032 --> 12:23.325
My house is a tent.

12:24.076 --> 12:26.620
I wish you were the first guy
I slept with who lived in a tent.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.040
Listen, I...

12:30.708 --> 12:31.834
I came by to apologize.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.087
I'm sure I came off as a bit crazy
and I'm really not.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.798
I mean, I'm crazy like, y'know,
"good" crazy.

12:37.882 --> 12:38.841
Like, "She's crazy!"

12:38.924 --> 12:41.093
But not like, y'know, "She's crazy!"

12:42.595 --> 12:46.015
Anyway, I freaked out
'cause I used to date Rooster.

12:47.933 --> 12:50.144
Wow, so I'm living in a dead guy's cabin

12:50.227 --> 12:51.812
and I just hooked up with his ex.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.731
I'm just like begging to be haunted.

12:55.649 --> 12:56.484
[door knocks]

12:57.860 --> 12:59.487
-Hey, Beau.
-Hey, Mary.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.322
You're probably wondering
what I'm doing here.

13:01.572 --> 13:05.242
Right now my grandkids are probably eating
something out of my Pez dispenser so...

13:05.326 --> 13:06.869
I'm gonna let Luke tell ya.

13:07.411 --> 13:08.579
See y'all later.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.249
I prefer nobody told me anything...

13:12.792 --> 13:13.667
ever.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.590
Look, I don't know what's going on here,
but, y'know, it's none of my business.

13:21.091 --> 13:22.676
But Mary's got some issues.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.137
Indeed.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.932
And some of those issues
make her very fun.

13:30.392 --> 13:32.394
I assume you're here because I...

13:33.395 --> 13:36.106
pulled a no-show
for the VA meeting yesterday,

13:36.190 --> 13:37.983
and I'm sorry.

13:38.901 --> 13:39.902
I...

13:39.985 --> 13:41.445
was planning on going.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.658
But... I didn't.

13:47.368 --> 13:50.204
I believe when a man
gives you his word, it means something.

13:51.872 --> 13:55.751
Some fella cuts me off in traffic
and I say, "I'll see you in hell,"

13:56.585 --> 13:58.587
I fully intend on meeting him there.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.218
When I gave you my word, I meant it.

14:05.427 --> 14:06.470
It's just...

14:08.138 --> 14:09.723
when it came time to go...

14:11.058 --> 14:15.020
You know, I've been to those things
and... it's a lot.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.233
I get that this isn't gonna be easy.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.819
There's gonna be stops and starts.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.114
All I'm asking
is that you be honest with me...

14:25.865 --> 14:27.157
along the way.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.828
If I can't trust you, I can't help you.

14:32.621 --> 14:33.664
That's fair.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.251
I do want help.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.336
I do. I...

14:40.296 --> 14:42.506
I'm done having insomnia
and panic attacks.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.759
I don't wanna be worried if I go to some
kid's birthday party and a balloon pops,

14:45.843 --> 14:47.386
I start slapping a clown.

14:50.347 --> 14:51.974
Nothing wrong with that.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.939
[Beau] Hey.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.357
[Joanne] Hey.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.442
What you doing?

15:01.525 --> 15:04.194
I went to the nursery
and I picked up some winter bulbs.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.697
That way, come spring,
we'll have a little color out here.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.782
Color ruined  Gunsmoke.

15:11.619 --> 15:12.912
[vehicle approaches]

15:13.078 --> 15:15.456
Just trying to make it look
a little more welcoming.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.457
Ah, that's nice.

15:17.041 --> 15:20.336
People can see flowers
just before they get shot for trespassin'.

15:23.422 --> 15:25.382
-Hey, Lisa.
-Hey, Joanne.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.967
Beau, we need to talk.

15:28.010 --> 15:29.261
Flowers and talking...

15:29.929 --> 15:31.305
What a great Wednesday!

15:32.556 --> 15:35.726
Have you been bossing my workers around,
telling them how to do their job?

15:36.477 --> 15:40.606
No, I was simply pointing out there's
another way to load cattle into a trailer,

15:41.106 --> 15:42.232
the correct way.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.777
Beau loves teachable moments.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.612
I know how to pour coffee now.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.951
They were trying to cram a dozen cows
into a 24-footer

15:52.034 --> 15:54.203
that was only meant to hold nine or ten.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.414
The other night when I said,
"These are my cows now,

15:57.498 --> 15:59.750
stay the fuck away from them,"
I was joking.

16:00.584 --> 16:03.337
But Beau, these are my cows now.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.297
Stay the fuck away from them.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.760
I promise you, they are in good hands.

16:11.720 --> 16:13.347
-Bye, Joanne.
-Bye, Lisa.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.393
[cow moos]

16:17.768 --> 16:19.853
-The point of you taking her deal...
-[engine starts]

16:19.937 --> 16:21.563
...is so that you wouldn't have to worry.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.149
You could spend more time relaxing
and enjoying yourself.

16:24.775 --> 16:27.778
We could go to Starbucks. You could
show them what they're doing wrong.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.408
I'm just sittin' around here
doin' nothin',

16:32.992 --> 16:35.077
while somebody else fucks
everything up.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.414
It's like watching Colt play football.

16:40.040 --> 16:43.210
We gotta get you outta this place,
have some fun.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.714
Dale mentioned he and Charlene
are gonna go play bingo tomorrow night.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.425
-Please listen to that sentence.
-[chuckles]

16:52.177 --> 16:53.220
What d'you wanna do, Beau?

16:53.303 --> 16:54.346
I don't know.

16:55.806 --> 16:57.725
I wouldn't be opposed
to shootin' something.

16:57.808 --> 16:58.892
There you go.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.894
How about we go duck hunting
tomorrow morning?

17:00.978 --> 17:02.021
That sounds great.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.856
Great, we'll leave at sunrise.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.899
I'll drive. I just filled up my Chevy.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.860
How about I just shoot that instead?

17:12.781 --> 17:14.825
[Colt] Hey there, hot shot.
How you doin'?

17:15.576 --> 17:17.077
Not great. I, er...

17:17.161 --> 17:20.080
had some gas station sushi
for breakfast.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.292
It was not fresh.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.211
Feeling a little bit...

17:26.295 --> 17:28.297
Arrrrgh! Arrrrgh!

17:28.589 --> 17:29.465
Arrrggh!

17:30.716 --> 17:31.550
Atchoo!

17:33.469 --> 17:35.304
People don't know what they're missing.

17:35.387 --> 17:39.266
Y'know, sitting in their cubicles
all day, not fake-puking insulation.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.311
Hey, thanks for your help.

17:43.062 --> 17:43.937
Oh, yeah.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.939
You got a lot going on.

17:46.523 --> 17:48.275
What happened with your cattle?
You sell 'em?

17:48.650 --> 17:49.985
[Colt] Oh, not yet.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.572
Got a buyer coming over later.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.701
Shitty deal,
but if Abby gets this teaching job...

17:58.786 --> 18:01.955
at least I won't have to sell my heifers,
and that's huge.

18:02.039 --> 18:02.998
What d'you mean, "if"?

18:03.624 --> 18:06.418
She's smart as hell, she loves football,

18:06.502 --> 18:07.711
and she's smoking hot.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.673
Who wouldn't wanna have her?

18:16.178 --> 18:17.262
As a teacher.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.266
You gotta stop that, dude.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.267
All right.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.020
Didn't know it bothered you,
but now that I know that

18:25.104 --> 18:26.814
I will definitely do it less.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.358
Hi!

18:29.441 --> 18:31.151
-Oh, hey, babe.
-[Abby] Hi!

18:32.027 --> 18:32.903
[Luke] Look at this.

18:32.986 --> 18:35.781
Somebody dressed to impress
and it worked.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.866
-[Abby] Oh!
-Shine!

18:37.950 --> 18:39.827
Thank you. You're so sweet.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.370
Yeah, not so sweet.

18:42.704 --> 18:44.331
How'd that interview go?

18:45.207 --> 18:46.208
I got the job. [chuckles]

18:47.292 --> 18:48.502
Fuck, yeah!

18:48.585 --> 18:49.711
Whoa, are you serious?

18:49.795 --> 18:52.840
Yes. I'm so excited, I'm sending someone
to detention on the first day.

18:52.923 --> 18:53.882
[Colt] Yeah.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.677
You need to make a kid your bitch early,
so they respect you.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.681
You don't have to send me to detention.
I'll be your bitch.

19:02.975 --> 19:03.976
I like you.

19:04.059 --> 19:05.602
Oh, babe, y'know what?

19:05.686 --> 19:06.812
We're celebratin'.

19:06.895 --> 19:08.105
We're going big.

19:08.188 --> 19:10.399
This cowgirl's checking into
the Golden Corral.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.025
Yeah!

19:19.950 --> 19:21.034
[Joanne] Boom!

19:21.118 --> 19:22.953
-There goes another one.
-[dog barks]

19:23.704 --> 19:26.456
Guess I didn't have to say "boom."
The gun said the "boom" part.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.459
Nice shot.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.628
You didn't even see it.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.839
I don't wanna bag more birds
'cause you're distracted,

19:33.922 --> 19:36.258
I wanna do it
'cause you can't shoot for shit.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.139
Lisa promised me progress reports
on my cattle.

19:42.222 --> 19:44.433
Come on, Beau,
we're supposed to be having fun.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.185
I am havin' fun.

19:47.603 --> 19:48.645
See?

19:50.439 --> 19:53.442
Okay, now I see why you're frowning
in all your pictures.

19:55.194 --> 19:56.195
[phone vibrates]

19:56.486 --> 19:57.362
Finally.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.034
What the fuck are they replacing
the ear tags for?

20:02.117 --> 20:03.493
Are you kidding me?

20:04.536 --> 20:07.122
We're out here together,
it's a beautiful day,

20:07.206 --> 20:08.790
and you won't get off your phone.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.628
If you were checking your hair
on that camera, I'd swear you were Colt.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.258
That's the meanest thing
you've ever said to me.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.014
Beau, you always say you're gonna change,

20:24.097 --> 20:26.099
and for about 30 minutes you do.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.810
And then you go right back
to being the same old Beau.

20:29.770 --> 20:32.522
And I feel bad because I feel like
I forced you into doing something

20:32.606 --> 20:33.607
that you don't wanna do.

20:34.274 --> 20:35.609
Well, screw this. I'm done.

20:36.276 --> 20:39.780
I'm going home to pour my coffee
however the fuck I want to.

20:40.364 --> 20:41.990
Come on, don't go.

20:44.534 --> 20:46.161
Let me guess, you're gonna change?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.790
You just called me "Colt."
I'm prepared to change everything.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.503
Look, I do wanna take a step back.

20:55.379 --> 20:57.381
I wanna spend more time with my family.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.050
I wanna spend more time with you.

21:01.468 --> 21:02.511
Well, I'm right here.

21:04.763 --> 21:05.889
You're right.

21:07.015 --> 21:08.267
Here.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.643
Thank you.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.606
Now can we stop talking about feelings
and get back to shootin' some shit?

21:17.484 --> 21:19.736
If that isn't in the Bible, it should be.

21:27.035 --> 21:28.412
[shouting above saw] Oh, hi, Frank.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.165
Fuckers at Papa John's
forgot to slice my pizza.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.878
-Want a piece?
-Oh, no.

21:36.962 --> 21:39.506
No, I got a baked potato
cooking on my engine block.

21:41.174 --> 21:44.052
So, this ought not to take long.
I've already seen your herd.

21:44.636 --> 21:46.179
Oh, yeah. Hey, one thing,

21:47.306 --> 21:50.183
I'm not gonna sell them heifers anymore,
it's just gonna be the herd.

21:50.267 --> 21:52.102
-What are you talking about?
-Well...

21:53.270 --> 21:54.563
I don't need the money anymore

21:54.646 --> 21:56.648
'cause my wife got a teaching job.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.775
Don't worry, she's not a nerd or anything.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.694
Well, I mean, she kinda is.
She reads books.

22:00.777 --> 22:01.820
It's gross.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.615
Colt, we had a deal.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.493
I've passed on other offers
'cause I was counting on those heifers.

22:09.453 --> 22:10.329
Shit.

22:11.038 --> 22:13.749
I'm sorry, but I ain't gonna sell 'em
if I don't have to.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.293
Fine.

22:16.752 --> 22:19.880
Well, then the best I can do
on your herd is $1.35 a pound.

22:20.839 --> 22:21.923
Are you kiddin' me?

22:22.966 --> 22:24.509
What happened to $1.40?

22:24.843 --> 22:26.636
Same thing that happened
to those heifers.

22:27.095 --> 22:30.015
Ugh... That's like an extra seven grand
outta my pocket.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.477
Well, if you need some extra money,
you could always sell some heifers.

22:34.478 --> 22:37.230
No, you're just fuckin' me on the price
'cause you know you can.

22:37.856 --> 22:41.777
It's your call, but it is late
in the season. Most places are full up.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.779
I'll just take them to auction.

22:43.862 --> 22:45.155
Oh, sure.

22:45.238 --> 22:48.033
Then you're looking at commission fees
and freight cost and...

22:48.950 --> 22:51.370
$1.35 a pound is the best I can do.

22:55.749 --> 22:56.666
Know what?

22:57.209 --> 22:58.794
Forget it. No deal.

22:59.920 --> 23:00.962
Seriously?

23:01.838 --> 23:05.175
Look, I'm not coming back out here again.
Not this year, not any year.

23:05.258 --> 23:08.220
If you ain't gonna offer me a fair price,
I don't want you out here.

23:09.846 --> 23:10.889
Take care, Frank.

23:12.182 --> 23:13.350
Good luck, Colt.

23:14.559 --> 23:15.852
Yeah, good luck to you.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.567
[indistinct chatter]

23:23.527 --> 23:26.071
Oh, good. I was hoping you'd be here.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.322
Really? Why?

23:27.406 --> 23:31.368
I've been dying to tell someone
about this crazy chick I hooked up with.

23:31.451 --> 23:33.370
I don't mean like, "Oh, she's crazy."

23:33.453 --> 23:35.205
I mean like, "Bitch is crazy."

23:35.580 --> 23:37.624
[laughing] That's funny.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.751
I hooked up with the weirdest guy.

23:39.835 --> 23:41.336
He cried after sex.

23:42.838 --> 23:45.340
I love when we dish like this.

23:48.051 --> 23:49.761
I'm just gonna grab a Keystone and...

23:49.845 --> 23:50.804
Sit down.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.265
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

23:53.348 --> 23:54.349
All right.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.770
I like when women tickle me.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.360
Oh, so now we're not dishing?

24:13.743 --> 24:15.412
You cooked, let me do the dishes.

24:15.495 --> 24:16.997
Are you sure? I could help.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.166
You taught me the right way
to dry a plate.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.003
I got it.

24:24.463 --> 24:25.672
Thanks again for dinner.

24:26.173 --> 24:27.257
It was delicious.

24:27.883 --> 24:31.011
What d'you call this again?
"Duck el Orange"?

24:33.305 --> 24:34.806
Duck a l'orange.

24:35.849 --> 24:37.058
It's French.

24:37.851 --> 24:39.144
-French?
-Mm.

24:39.269 --> 24:42.105
They should've called it,
"Duck and hide from the Nazis."

24:42.314 --> 24:43.523
[telephone rings]

24:46.568 --> 24:48.195
-Thanks again for today.
-[still ringing]

24:48.862 --> 24:49.946
I needed that.

24:50.030 --> 24:50.864
[still ringing]

24:50.989 --> 24:52.949
Okay, no more French food for you.

24:53.033 --> 24:54.284
You're getting soft.

24:56.745 --> 24:57.662
Hello.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.080
Hey, Billy.

25:01.416 --> 25:02.334
What?

25:04.878 --> 25:06.505
Jesus Christ.

25:07.839 --> 25:08.715
No.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.092
That's okay. Yeah.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.220
Thanks, Billy.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.725
That was the police.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.560
What did Colt do?

25:23.063 --> 25:25.440
It's not Colt. It's Luke.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.531
[door opens]

25:33.448 --> 25:34.616
-Hey.
-Hey, babe.

25:34.699 --> 25:35.575
[Abby] Hey.

25:36.284 --> 25:37.953
You been working this whole time?

25:38.620 --> 25:39.913
Ah, yeah.

25:40.497 --> 25:44.251
I wanted to get that insulation in
so I can get the drywall up.

25:44.918 --> 25:48.505
Plus, I had to clean up pepperoni cheese
off the table saw.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.259
What you still doin' up?

25:52.884 --> 25:54.302
Oh, I thought we could talk.

25:55.428 --> 25:57.222
Ah, is it about Luke being creepy?

25:58.765 --> 26:00.058
I'll talk to him.

26:00.141 --> 26:01.393
No, I love Luke.

26:02.644 --> 26:03.478
Oh.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.316
I'll talk to him anyway.

26:10.860 --> 26:12.320
I was putting Peyton down...

26:13.738 --> 26:16.241
She does not fit into her
little Broncos pajamas anymore.

26:16.324 --> 26:17.826
-No.
-No.

26:18.368 --> 26:20.287
-She's growing so fast.
-[chuckles]

26:21.705 --> 26:24.708
Ah, and then I was putting her
in her new pajamas and...

26:25.792 --> 26:28.628
she was squirming around
and acting all silly,

26:28.712 --> 26:31.214
and I was like,
"Peyton, you need to sit still."

26:31.798 --> 26:35.802
[chuckles] And when I said her name,
she looked up at me.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.014
It was like she knew who I was,

26:39.973 --> 26:42.517
and who she was. It's like... wow.

26:45.228 --> 26:46.980
-[chuckles]
-[softly] That's awesome.

26:47.439 --> 26:48.273
It was.

26:50.942 --> 26:53.486
That's why I can't take that job
in Norwood.

26:57.240 --> 26:58.116
What?

26:58.199 --> 27:00.368
She does something different every day.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.413
If I'm at work, I'm gonna miss all that.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.832
Like the first time she crawls,

27:06.416 --> 27:09.294
her first word, her first step.
I can't miss  any  of that.

27:12.714 --> 27:13.673
-Okay.
-[laughs]

27:17.385 --> 27:19.679
What about all that other stuff you said?

27:20.764 --> 27:21.765
Look, babe...

27:22.515 --> 27:24.684
who knows when this opportunity's
gonna come along again?

27:24.768 --> 27:25.977
No, I know.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.646
I know, I love teaching.

27:29.898 --> 27:31.608
It's just not what I want right now.

27:31.691 --> 27:34.110
Maybe I can go back
when she's a little bit older.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.530
But right now,
I just wanna be Peyton's mom.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.579
You don't understand.

27:46.289 --> 27:48.249
You have to take this job.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.834
What? Why?

27:50.377 --> 27:53.296
I thought you would be happy
that I wanna stay home.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.842
But we need the money.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.555
I know it would be easier
if we had a little bit more extra,

28:02.639 --> 28:05.308
but I don't need a brand new car, okay?

28:05.392 --> 28:07.727
We can cut back on things
like the Golden Corral.

28:07.811 --> 28:10.647
Costco sells beer. You drink in bulk,
why not buy in bulk?

28:15.777 --> 28:16.653
No.

28:17.320 --> 28:18.321
Listen to me.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.533
We  need  the money.

28:25.412 --> 28:26.955
Okay, what is going on?

28:27.872 --> 28:29.249
What are you talking about?

28:34.462 --> 28:37.006
I didn't sell the herd to Lisa Neumann
like I told you.

28:39.509 --> 28:40.385
What?

28:42.554 --> 28:43.430
Then...

28:43.972 --> 28:48.143
Frank came by and offered me
even lower than last time, so I said no.

28:49.102 --> 28:50.103
On top of that...

28:51.563 --> 28:53.690
your parents wanna be paid back
for that loan.

28:55.608 --> 28:56.860
Oh, my God.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.404
Oh, my God.

28:59.487 --> 29:02.282
Hey, babe, it's gonna be okay, though.

29:02.365 --> 29:05.827
With your teaching salary
we can wait until...

29:05.910 --> 29:07.287
the market goes up.

29:07.370 --> 29:09.122
We just talked about communicating more.

29:09.664 --> 29:11.875
You promised me that you would
and then you turn around

29:11.958 --> 29:13.126
and you lie to my face!

29:13.209 --> 29:14.502
I didn't want you to worry.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.757
I thought you were supporting me.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.220
But you were just looking out
for yourself.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.685
I thought when we got married... [sniffs]

29:31.978 --> 29:33.229
and had a baby...

29:34.272 --> 29:35.815
that maybe you'd grow up.

29:38.860 --> 29:41.404
You're just the same... Colt Bennett.

29:44.157 --> 29:44.991
