<i>Phineas's life

01:56.800 --> 01:58.400
<i>Those who knew Phineas best</i>

01:58.500 --> 02:01.600

02:01.700 --> 02:04.100
<i>Once even-keeled

02:04.200 --> 02:08.000

<i>But would it surprise you

<i>as "Cyrus Ames"?</i>

02:18.700 --> 02:21.800
<i>Who, you ask, was Cyrus Ames?</i>

02:22.100 --> 02:26.000
<i>Cyrus Ames was a notorious
gunfighter and card cheat.</i>

02:26.200 --> 02:28.800
<i>For a time, he was employed
by the railroads</i>

02:28.900 --> 02:31.200
<i>to shoot any Indians
who attempted to interfere</i>

02:31.300 --> 02:32.900

02:33.000 --> 02:35.400
<i>On the day

<i>Cyrus Ames lay dying

02:39.100 --> 02:42.100

02:42.400 --> 02:43.600
<i>There are some who believe</i>

02:43.700 --> 02:46.700
<i>that an exchange of sorts
took place that day.</i>

02:46.800 --> 02:49.200
<i>That the soul
of a dying gunfighter</i>

02:49.300 --> 02:53.800
<i>somehow slipped into the body
of an injured railroad worker.</i>

02:54.000 --> 02:57.100
<i>Coincidence?
We may never know.</i>

02:57.500 --> 02:59.300
<i>Unlikely? Yes.</i>

02:59.400 --> 03:02.700
<i>Impossible? 
You be the judge.</i>

03:02.800 --> 03:05.500
<i>A man by the name of

Bad dream?

03:16.900 --> 03:18.400
Bad rerun.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.800
It was weird; I dreamt
about an old TV show.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.000
Hmm? You mean
no one's in danger?

03:27.000 --> 03:28.200
You don't have
to call anyone?

03:28.300 --> 03:30.200
We can just go
back to sleep?

03:32.100 --> 03:33.500
Oh, I don't
believe it.

灵媒缉凶 第五季第1集</font>

05:04.000 --> 05:06.000
Allison,
you're here. Good.

05:06.100 --> 05:07.600
Once you're settled,
would you join me and Lee

05:07.700 --> 05:09.400
for a meeting in the
conference room, please?

05:09.500 --> 05:10.800
With him?

05:12.700 --> 05:13.900
With them.

05:15.200 --> 05:17.200
Lee, Allison,
this is Joel Tiernan.

05:18.100 --> 05:21.900
And sitting beside him is my
old friend, his wife, Gabrielle.

05:22.800 --> 05:23.500
DEVALOS:
Six months ago,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.600
Gabrielle's sister,
Robin, was found murdered

05:25.700 --> 05:28.900
in a cottage she'd
rented on Saguaro Lake.

05:29.200 --> 05:30.600
There were
no witnesses

05:30.700 --> 05:32.000
and as of now,

05:32.100 --> 05:34.100
no suspects.

05:34.900 --> 05:36.100
This all took place
during the time

05:36.200 --> 05:38.400
when District Attorney Van Dyke
was running this office.

05:38.500 --> 05:42.000
His people worked the case
but, uh, but never solved it.

05:42.900 --> 05:46.400
I believe it was,
um, August 16th

05:46.600 --> 05:47.900
when I first
realized that

05:48.000 --> 05:50.500
the Phoenix Police
Department had given up

05:50.600 --> 05:52.900
on trying to find
my sister's killer.

05:53.300 --> 05:56.700
I had called District Attorney
Van Dyke for an update,

05:56.800 --> 06:01.500
and, um, he told me there were
no new developments in the case.

06:01.700 --> 06:05.000
When I asked him when I might
expect any new developments,

06:05.100 --> 06:07.200
he was kind enough
to explain to me

06:07.300 --> 06:10.300
that good police work
depends on good leads

06:10.500 --> 06:13.600
and since there were no
new leads in the case...

06:16.200 --> 06:17.000
DEVALOS:
Six months ago,

06:17.100 --> 06:19.300
there was nothing
I could do about that.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.100
Now I can.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.100
That's why I'm putting
my two best people on it.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.600
<i>ROBIN:
I'm going to tell her
everything.</i>

06:31.000 --> 06:32.400
What did you just say?

06:32.500 --> 06:33.900
You heard me.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.500
I'm going to tell her
everything.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.000
I think I saw his face.

06:50.400 --> 06:51.500
What are you talking about?

06:51.500 --> 06:54.100
The killer, I think
I saw his face.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.100
Maybe if you put me
together with a sketch artist,

06:56.200 --> 06:59.400
we might have something for you
to work with this afternoon.

07:00.600 --> 07:03.800
Hey, kiddo.
How was school?

07:05.400 --> 07:09.600
Hmm, why the long face?

07:09.800 --> 07:12.700
I sort of got
in trouble in art class.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.800
Oh, yeah?
What happened?

07:15.300 --> 07:20.500
I kind of drew a funny picture
of my teacher, Mr. Enright.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.900
Uh-oh. Did you apologize?

07:23.000 --> 07:25.400
Well, yeah but he
wants you and Mom

07:25.500 --> 07:28.800
to look at the picture
anyways and sign it

07:28.900 --> 07:31.500
so he knows you saw it.
Okay.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.000
Bridgette,
you drew this?

07:40.100 --> 07:41.900
That man
is naked.

07:42.600 --> 07:44.200
He sure is.

07:45.100 --> 07:48.100
DEVALOS:
This is the man you believe
murdered Robin Aaronson?

07:48.300 --> 07:50.400
I think it's a
pretty good likeness.

08:01.200 --> 08:03.600
Tell me, is this
the man you saw?

08:05.500 --> 08:07.600
Yes.
Absolutely.

08:07.700 --> 08:09.000
You know this man?

08:09.100 --> 08:10.000
I knew him.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.900
He was Gabrielle's
first husband, Nathan.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.900
He was a very
successful novelist,

08:14.200 --> 08:18.500
and when he died, he left
Gabrielle a very wealthy woman.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.000
He's dead?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.600
He was killed in a car
crash two years ago,

08:21.700 --> 08:23.600
driving home from
a writers' retreat.

08:23.700 --> 08:26.900
Struck head-on by another
vehicle, a stolen vehicle.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.100
By the time the accident
site was discovered,

08:29.200 --> 08:31.400
the other driver, the car
thief, had disappeared.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.100
Skulked off into the night.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.200
We never managed
to identify him.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.500
I'm sorry, Allison. I don't
know what you think you saw,

08:39.900 --> 08:41.200
but Nathan's been dead
for two years now.

08:41.299 --> 08:44.500
It seems unlikely that he killed
Gabrielle's sister 6 months ago.

08:46.900 --> 08:47.700
<i>JOE:
Hey, look on the bright side.</i>

08:47.800 --> 08:49.100
At least this woman
wasn't in the room

08:49.200 --> 08:52.100
when you accused her dead
husband of murdering her sister.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.800
Would you put that
thing away already?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.900
I'm sorry.
It's just so...

08:57.300 --> 08:58.600
Accurate?

08:59.600 --> 09:03.400
Yeah, I mean I know we've
had the talk with Bridgette,

09:03.900 --> 09:05.900
and I know she's seen all
this stuff in science class,

09:06.000 --> 09:07.300
but I mean,
it's just...

09:07.400 --> 09:08.600
But what?

09:08.600 --> 09:09.900
You're acting like you never

09:10.000 --> 09:12.200
drew a picture of a
naked person before.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.800
Yeah, I'm sure that I scribbled

09:13.800 --> 09:15.900
the occasional "bazoom"
in my notebook,

09:16.000 --> 09:17.800
but I mean, nothing like this.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.800
What? A young boy's fascination
with "bazooms" is okay?

09:21.900 --> 09:24.800
But a young girl's curiosity
about that, isn't?

09:25.900 --> 09:27.900
I'm just going to
turn off the light now.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.900
Yeah, you do that.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.000
SCANLON:
So, you're telling me
Joel Tiernan did this?

10:18.900 --> 10:21.300
Joel Tiernan, Gabrielle
Tiernan's current husband,

10:21.400 --> 10:22.700
is, in fact, the
hit-and-run driver

10:22.800 --> 10:25.300
who killed her first
husband, Nathan Cafferty?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.900
That is one very forgiving lady.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.900
Well, obviously,
I don't think she knows.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.600
Obviously.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.100
Look, I know how
this sounds, Lee,

10:35.200 --> 10:37.400
but I dreamt about
it last night.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.600
Joel Tiernan was the other
driver in that accident.

10:40.700 --> 10:43.900
I think that's how he got
that big scar on his forehead.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.100
What?!

10:46.200 --> 10:48.200
I'm sorry, it's just Manny
puts us on one cold case,

10:48.300 --> 10:50.800
and you start dreaming about
another that's even colder.

10:51.000 --> 10:52.900
Maybe tonight you'll see
who took the Lindbergh baby.

10:53.000 --> 10:53.700
What if I'm right?

10:53.700 --> 10:56.700
What if Joel Tiernan
is responsible for this?

10:58.400 --> 11:00.500
If you're sure
about what you saw,

11:00.600 --> 11:02.000
and when I say "sure,"
I'm talking

11:02.100 --> 11:03.900
in the neighborhood
of 100 percent...

11:05.900 --> 11:07.300
then I'll bring the guy in
for questioning.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.900
Ask him to account
for his whereabouts

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
at the time of the wreck.
But if you're not...

11:12.100 --> 11:13.500
Remember, these
are Manny's friends.

11:13.500 --> 11:15.500
At least the wife is.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.600
I got to tell you, if you're
right about this Tiernan guy,

11:17.700 --> 11:19.500
Gabrielle sure can pick them.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.400
What is that supposed to mean?

11:21.400 --> 11:22.300
I interviewed
a few of the

11:22.400 --> 11:24.400
dead sister's friends yesterday.

11:24.500 --> 11:25.900
One of them told me
about a little accident

11:26.000 --> 11:27.400
Robin had in '06.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.500
She claimed
she'd fallen,

11:28.600 --> 11:30.900
but the friend spotted
some bruising around her neck.

11:31.000 --> 11:34.300
Got the feeling she may have
been covering for someone.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.600
An abusive boyfriend, maybe.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.000
Turns out she was.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.700
And his name was
Nathan Cafferty.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.600
Wait a second, she
was having an affair

11:45.700 --> 11:47.200
with her sister's husband?

11:47.300 --> 11:48.800
For about a year
until Nathan decided

11:48.900 --> 11:50.900
he was still in love
with Gabrielle.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.400
According to the friend,
Robin didn't take it well.

11:53.500 --> 11:55.500
Threatened
to tell her sister.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.700
Nathan got physical.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.800
Grabbed Robin by the neck,
threw her up against the wall.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.600
It happened in the same cabin
she died in.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.200
I saw it, Lee.
I saw it yesterday.

12:08.300 --> 12:11.300
I just didn't understand.
So, so, wait...

12:11.500 --> 12:13.600
So, if Robin was having
an affair with Nathan,

12:13.700 --> 12:15.700
shouldn't we bring in
Gabrielle for questioning?

12:15.800 --> 12:17.200
She's the one with the motive.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.600
If she knew her sister
was getting it on

12:18.700 --> 12:21.300
with her husband, sure.
But according to the friend,

12:21.400 --> 12:22.900
she never found out.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.300
Besides, I did
some checking.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.800
There are all kinds of photos
of her at some charity event

12:26.900 --> 12:29.500
in Flagstaff till the wee hours
on the night of the murder.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.400
Plus, she's the one that came
to us for help, remember?

12:32.500 --> 12:35.900
It wouldn't make much sense to
reheat a case that'd gone cold

12:36.000 --> 12:38.900
if, uh, if you were
the killer, now, would it?

12:39.700 --> 12:40.600
<i>JOE:
Hey, it's me.</i>

12:40.700 --> 12:43.000
Um, hey, listen. I just got a
call from Bridgette's school.

12:43.100 --> 12:44.800
They want us to come in today
at 3:00

12:44.900 --> 12:46.100
to meet with, uh,

12:46.200 --> 12:48.200
her art teacher
and a school counselor.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.000
Yeah.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.500
I teach art,
Mr. and Mrs. Dubois.

12:51.800 --> 12:54.400
I'm not a prudish man,
and if I were teaching

12:54.800 --> 12:57.000
a life drawing class
to a group of college students,

12:57.100 --> 12:59.100
I might be inclined
to laugh this off.

12:59.600 --> 13:01.200
But the fact is,

13:01.300 --> 13:03.900
Bridgette is a ten-year-old
in a fourth grade art class.

13:04.000 --> 13:07.400
And this is the second time
in two days she's drawn

13:07.800 --> 13:10.500
a vivid portrait
of me-- her teacher.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.900
I don't know what
to say, Mr. Enright.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.600
This obviously
is inappropriate,
and we're very sorry.

13:16.700 --> 13:19.100
Yeah.
I appreciate that.
And please understand,

13:19.200 --> 13:20.800
Bridgette is one of the
most imaginative students

13:20.900 --> 13:22.500
I've ever had the
pleasure to teach.

13:22.600 --> 13:24.600
I adore having her
in the class,

13:25.100 --> 13:27.200
but I'd be lying if I said
the last couple of days

13:27.300 --> 13:29.100
haven't been disturbing to me.

13:29.200 --> 13:32.800
So, that's why I asked
Mrs. Tharp to sit in with us.

13:32.900 --> 13:35.100
Mr. Enright and I thought
that perhaps Bridgette

13:35.200 --> 13:37.900
could use the benefit of
a few sessions with me.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.800
You think that Bridgette
needs to see a psychologist?

13:41.500 --> 13:42.300
Because of this?

13:42.400 --> 13:44.400
MRS. THARP:
The drawings are
rather graphic.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.700
We just wanted
to find out

13:45.800 --> 13:48.200
where Bridgette got the
impulse to make them.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.000
To see if she's been exposed
to anything that could have

13:51.100 --> 13:54.500
caused this preoccupation
with the naked form.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.300
Oh, wait a second. She hasn't
been exposed to anything,

13:57.400 --> 13:58.800
and this is not
a preoccupation.

13:58.900 --> 14:01.700
It's just a kid
using her imagination.

14:02.700 --> 14:03.700
I mean, Bridgette
needs a lesson

14:03.800 --> 14:05.000
in what's appropriate
and what isn't.

14:05.100 --> 14:07.500
She doesn't need, she
doesn't need to go to therapy.

14:07.600 --> 14:09.900
With all due respect,
you're not the subject

14:10.000 --> 14:12.100
of the drawings, Mr. Dubois.
I am.

14:12.200 --> 14:14.200
- Yeah, but...
- I'm not sure I agree with your assessment.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.600
Well, I'm not sure that
you know my daughter

14:15.700 --> 14:17.300
as well as you think
you do, Mr. Enright.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.900
Mrs. Tharp,

14:19.300 --> 14:20.500
we do appreciate
your offer, I think

14:20.600 --> 14:22.700
we're going to speak
with Bridgette ourselves

14:22.800 --> 14:24.800
before we take
you up on that.

14:25.500 --> 14:29.600
Mr. Enright, I am sorry for
any kind of discomfort

14:29.700 --> 14:32.700
or embarrassment that our
daughter may have caused you.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.400
We will make sure we speak
with Bridgette and let her know

14:35.500 --> 14:38.900
that these kinds of drawings
in school are not appropriate.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Absolutely.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
And I promise you this
will never happen again.

14:50.000 --> 14:51.700
Hi, kiddo.
How you doing?

14:51.900 --> 14:53.100
Okay.

14:54.600 --> 14:55.800
I'm sorry.

14:55.900 --> 14:58.500
Hey, it's okay, sweetie.
We're not mad at you.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.900
But you need to stop drawing
pictures of your teacher.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.700
It's making him
uncomfortable.

15:03.800 --> 15:07.900
<i>Well, I didn't want to draw
another picture of Mr. Enright.</i>

15:08.000 --> 15:10.200
I just felt like I had to.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.000
What do you mean,
you had to?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.500
I don't know.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.900
When I close my eyes,
I see him in my head.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.000
And I just know that I have
to put it down on paper.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.200
<i>JOE:
Maybe Bridgette's
not the problem here.</i>

15:24.300 --> 15:26.700
Maybe it's that teacher that
we should be worried about.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.200
So, what are you saying?
This is Mr. Enright's fault?

15:29.300 --> 15:30.900
Well, I don't know.
All I know is that

15:31.000 --> 15:32.400
she goes in his class,
and then she feels like

15:32.500 --> 15:34.600
she has to draw him
without his clothes on.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.000
Why? Huh? What's going on
in this guy's head?

15:37.100 --> 15:37.900
What kind of, I don't know,

15:38.000 --> 15:39.800
energy is Bridgette
picking up on?

15:39.900 --> 15:40.600
What are you saying?

15:40.600 --> 15:43.300
Mr. Enright's putting in
some kind of "naked energy"?

15:43.400 --> 15:44.500
I don't know
but I think that we should

15:44.500 --> 15:45.500
talk to somebody at the school,

15:45.600 --> 15:47.400
and we should get her
transferred to another class.

15:47.500 --> 15:50.400
Whoa, okay, good luck
with that conversation.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.900
You'd better make sure that
you have your facts straight.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
If you're going
to accuse somebody

15:54.100 --> 15:55.900
of putting out a "naked vibe,"

15:56.100 --> 15:58.300
just make sure you have
all your ducks in a row.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.300
I don't understand how
you can just dismiss this.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.400
I'm not. It'll pass, Joe.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.700
I asked Bridgette specifically,

16:04.800 --> 16:06.900
"Did anything
inappropriate happen?"

16:07.000 --> 16:08.600
"Anything at all that
made you feel uncomfortable?"

16:08.700 --> 16:10.800
She said no. It'll pass.

16:10.900 --> 16:13.900
Whatever it is that's making her
want to draw these pictures,

16:14.000 --> 16:15.800
it'll pass.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.300
If we make a huge thing of this,

16:18.400 --> 16:19.200
we're just going
to make Bridgette

16:19.300 --> 16:21.900
more confused
than she already is.

16:22.900 --> 16:23.600
Hello?

16:23.700 --> 16:25.300
All right, you got me thinking.

16:25.700 --> 16:28.400
I just took a look at our files
on Nathan Cafferty's accident.

16:28.500 --> 16:31.100
Unfortunately, it turns out
the city destroyed both cars

16:31.200 --> 16:32.400
about a year ago.
(whispers): Scanlon.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.700
It's not like we're
going to find any DNA

16:33.800 --> 16:35.700
to help us figure out
who was driving that other car.

16:35.800 --> 16:37.800
But I did find one
interesting thing.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.500
Turns out our friend
Joel has a record.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.800
Arrested in '02 for car theft,

16:42.900 --> 16:45.000
and again in '04
for check-kiting.

16:45.100 --> 16:46.700
Although how that proves
he killed Nathan Cafferty,

16:46.800 --> 16:48.000
I have no idea.

16:48.100 --> 16:49.100
Well, what about the papers?

16:49.200 --> 16:50.900
Maybe you should
check the papers.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.400
What papers?

16:52.600 --> 16:55.400
The papers from the accident
scene. They were everywhere.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.000
There were hundreds of them.
I saw Joel touch one of them.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.500
If they're in
the evidence locker,

16:59.600 --> 17:01.700
maybe we should check them
for fingerprints.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.200
Allison, I'm looking
at the report right here,

17:03.300 --> 17:04.700
and there's no mention
of any papers.

17:04.800 --> 17:07.800
It's just two cars
and one dead body.

17:07.900 --> 17:08.700
You know what I think
your problem is?

17:08.800 --> 17:10.900
You're focusing
on the wrong case.

17:11.099 --> 17:12.900
Our boss asked us
to help solve the murder

17:13.000 --> 17:14.599
of his friend's sister, and
instead, you're running around

17:14.700 --> 17:15.500
trying to prove that her husband

17:15.599 --> 17:16.800
committed vehicular
manslaughter.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.000
Maybe you should just stick
to the case at hand.

17:19.099 --> 17:20.800
Just a suggestion.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.300
Tell me about the first time
we made love.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.900
We were staying at
your parents' house.

17:27.300 --> 17:29.900
You snuck into the
guest room to join me.

17:31.400 --> 17:34.300
You were worried
about getting caught.

17:34.700 --> 17:37.400
But then you fell
asleep in my arms.

17:37.800 --> 17:40.100
Your mom woke us up
in the morning

17:40.700 --> 17:42.700
but she didn't
seem that mad.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.500
How did we celebrate when
you sold your first novel?

17:51.600 --> 17:53.300
We booked a
Presidential Suite

17:53.300 --> 17:55.300
at a resort we
couldn't afford,

17:56.100 --> 17:58.700
and we ordered room
service all weekend.

18:03.300 --> 18:04.900
I was, uh...

18:06.000 --> 18:07.700
I had a difficult year.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.100
I was, I was going
through something.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.000
The miscarriage.

18:13.200 --> 18:14.900
You were almost
three months along.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.500
No one knew but us.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.100
We were just about to share
the good news with our parents.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
We even had names picked out.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.300
Courtney if it
was a girl.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.700
Peter if it
was a boy.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.100
When you called me, I just...

18:37.100 --> 18:38.100
I just couldn't believe

18:38.200 --> 18:40.700
that anything you were saying
could be true,

18:42.200 --> 18:44.100
that there was any chance
that you could be

18:44.200 --> 18:46.200
who you said you were,
that there was any

18:47.600 --> 18:51.300
possibility that...
we could be together again.

18:51.400 --> 18:53.100
It's me, Gabby.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.400
It's Nathan.

18:54.700 --> 18:57.300
I've come back to you
and I promise,

18:57.400 --> 18:59.700
I'm never going to
leave you again.

19:07.600 --> 19:08.800
Mrs. Dubois.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.000
Hi, I'm sorry.
I know it's early,

19:10.100 --> 19:11.400
I know I didn't call first.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.800
No, no, it's fine.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.100
What's, uh, what's on your mind?

19:16.400 --> 19:17.700
The night before I met you,

19:17.800 --> 19:21.200
I had a dream that,
that I couldn't understand.

19:21.700 --> 19:24.500
It was about a man
who died a long time ago.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.700
Only instead of
his soul crossing over,

19:28.200 --> 19:30.500
it... it made its way
into this other man.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.800
Well, I guess
that's why I'm here.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.500
The more I come to learn
about your family,

19:39.600 --> 19:43.500
the more sense
this dream starts to make.

19:44.200 --> 19:46.500
After Nathan's accident,
there were days

19:46.600 --> 19:48.600
I didn't know how I'd carry on,

19:48.700 --> 19:51.100
or if I even could carry on.

19:52.100 --> 19:55.200
But then, just when
I was ready to give up...

19:55.500 --> 19:57.000
Joel Tiernan appeared?

19:57.300 --> 20:00.100
Imagine losing the
love of your life,

20:00.200 --> 20:02.200
but then before
you'd even begun

20:02.300 --> 20:04.900
to start mourning the loss,
getting him back.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.900
Being spared the lifetime
it would've taken

20:07.000 --> 20:08.700
to get over that loss.

20:08.700 --> 20:12.500
It was, uh, it was a miracle.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.500
Nothing short of a miracle.

20:14.600 --> 20:17.200
Surely you, of all people,
can appreciate that.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.800
Did Nathan ever talk to you

20:18.900 --> 20:21.700
about what happened
the night of the accident?

20:21.800 --> 20:23.200
Did he ever tell you how exactly

20:23.300 --> 20:25.800
he might have crossed paths
with Joel Tiernan?

20:25.900 --> 20:29.400
No, no. All he remembers was
the screeching of tires.

20:30.300 --> 20:31.900
Nothing after that.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.800
And in regards to Joel Tiernan,

20:33.900 --> 20:36.500
neither one of us
remembered ever meeting him.

20:37.100 --> 20:40.000
We tried to investigate
his life after the switch,

20:40.100 --> 20:41.100
but as it turned out,

20:41.200 --> 20:43.600
there wasn't much
of a life to investigate.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.100
No family,

20:45.400 --> 20:48.600
no friends to notice
Joel behaving differently.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.600
I can only imagine
what a comfort it must've been

20:51.700 --> 20:53.300
to have your husband,
your real husband,

20:53.400 --> 20:57.000
by your side when you got
the news of Robin's death.

20:57.100 --> 21:00.700
Actually, I was, uh, I was
by myself when I got the news.

21:00.900 --> 21:02.700
I'd gone to an
event that night.

21:02.800 --> 21:03.500
Joel couldn't go

21:03.600 --> 21:06.700
and so we didn't see each
other until much later...

21:08.100 --> 21:10.900
but it-it was, it was
difficult for Joel, too.

21:11.300 --> 21:13.700
I think he loved her
as much as I did.

21:14.900 --> 21:17.700
Bridge! I heard a rumor
you weren't dressed yet.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.500
Just leave
me alone!

21:19.500 --> 21:21.200
Come on, come on.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.700
It's getting late.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.300
I'm sorry, Daddy.

21:26.400 --> 21:27.300
What are you sorry about, honey?

21:27.400 --> 21:28.500
What's the matter?

21:28.600 --> 21:31.800
I know I wasn't supposed to...

21:32.300 --> 21:35.200
but I couldn't stop.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.200
<i>DEVALOS:Joel Tiernan</i>

21:44.300 --> 21:45.600
<i>is Nathan Cafferty.</i>

21:45.700 --> 21:46.900
That's what you're telling me?

21:46.900 --> 21:48.500
I know how this sounds.

21:48.500 --> 21:49.400
No, I don't think you do.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.100
It sounds insane, Allison.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.300
You are telling me
that the essence

21:53.400 --> 21:55.500
of my friend's
dead husband somehow

21:55.600 --> 21:57.800
found its way into the
body of that man, Joel Tiernan,

21:57.900 --> 22:00.200
and that therefore, we
should question Joel Tiernan

22:00.300 --> 22:02.000
for the, for the murder
of Gabrielle's sister...?

22:02.100 --> 22:04.200
They were having an affair.
She threatened to tell.

22:04.300 --> 22:05.600
Who was she having
an affair with?

22:05.700 --> 22:06.800
On whom was she
threatening to tell?

22:06.900 --> 22:08.000
They're one and the same.

22:08.100 --> 22:09.000
Right, and I think that's

22:09.100 --> 22:10.500
a pretty tough sell to a jury.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.100
Sir, I am telling you,

22:12.200 --> 22:13.500
Joel Tiernan was
driving the car

22:13.600 --> 22:16.000
that killed Nathan
Cafferty that night.

22:16.300 --> 22:18.500
Joel and Nathan were
within yards of each other

22:18.600 --> 22:20.400
when Nathan's soul
left his body,

22:20.500 --> 22:23.000
but instead of going wherever
it was supposed to go...

22:23.100 --> 22:24.800
It did what?
It... just made its way

22:24.900 --> 22:26.800
to the nearest warm body
and took up residence.

22:26.900 --> 22:27.900
Is that really what you think?

22:28.000 --> 22:30.300
I know that's what
his wife thinks.

22:33.600 --> 22:35.300
Sir, please, can't we
just bring him in here

22:35.400 --> 22:38.600
and ask him where he was the
night his sister-in-law died?

22:39.700 --> 22:41.000
What do you mean,
no one asked him that?

22:41.100 --> 22:42.900
No one has asked
him anything.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.700
No one thought it mattered.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.200
In the past 24 hours, a theory
of evidence has emerged.

22:50.300 --> 22:53.500
It's unconventional, to be
sure, but I was just curious

22:53.600 --> 22:56.400
as to whether you might
have a point of view about it.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.900
Mrs. Tiernan,
Gabrielle,

22:59.000 --> 23:01.500
recently spoke with
Mrs. Dubois here and...

23:01.700 --> 23:04.200
shared some very
interesting things

23:04.300 --> 23:08.700
about the nature of you and your
wife's... mutual attraction.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.300
My wife...

23:15.600 --> 23:18.300
My wife is very spiritual.

23:18.600 --> 23:19.500
Uh...

23:19.600 --> 23:23.300
She has some rather romantic
ideas about life and death.

23:24.600 --> 23:27.100
Yeah. I'm not sure she's...

23:27.200 --> 23:29.600
entirely over the loss
of her first husband.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.300
I suppose, inevitably,

23:31.400 --> 23:34.100
appearance aside, uh...
I have some things,

23:34.200 --> 23:36.400
some traits in common
with Nathan,

23:36.600 --> 23:38.400
and I'm sure Gabrielle...

23:38.700 --> 23:41.000
interprets those similarities,

23:41.100 --> 23:42.400
well, with a...

23:42.900 --> 23:44.700
a romantic's heart,

23:44.700 --> 23:46.800
a romantic's sensibility.

23:47.600 --> 23:50.100
I hope you don't think
too badly of her.

23:50.900 --> 23:53.000
It's one of the reasons
I love her so.

23:56.200 --> 23:57.300
Anything else?

23:57.400 --> 23:59.000
<i>There is one
more thing.</i>

24:00.000 --> 24:01.200
Do you happen to
remember where you were

24:01.300 --> 24:03.700
the night that
Robin was murdered?

24:03.800 --> 24:06.600
Of course. Um, at home.

24:06.600 --> 24:08.200
In bed sick.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.800
Gabrielle had this, uh...

24:10.900 --> 24:13.000
charity thing, really
wanted me to go with her

24:13.100 --> 24:14.300
and meet some
of her friends,

24:14.400 --> 24:16.600
but I just couldn't
get out of bed.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.600
Then she got that
horrible news...

24:19.700 --> 24:22.400
and we weren't
even together,

24:22.700 --> 24:24.800
<i>and, I mean, we're
always together.</i>

24:25.400 --> 24:26.200
Was anyone else

24:26.300 --> 24:28.600
home that night? A cook, a maid?

24:31.800 --> 24:33.400
Would that be a "no"?

24:33.500 --> 24:35.400
Yes, that's a "no."

24:37.200 --> 24:39.400
Are you heading where
I think you're heading?

24:39.600 --> 24:40.500
I barely knew Robin.

24:40.600 --> 24:42.300
I just barely
married her sister.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.100
Why in the world would I
want to do her any harm?

24:45.200 --> 24:47.200
On the morning
after Robin was murdered,

24:47.300 --> 24:49.700
the police found a...
a spot of blood

24:50.800 --> 24:52.400
at the crime scene
that wasn't hers.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.300
Yes, I know.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.600
It was in all
the papers. So?

24:55.900 --> 24:58.900
So we were wondering if you'd
mind giving us a blood sample.

24:59.300 --> 25:00.200
It would enable us

25:00.300 --> 25:02.100
to rule you out,
Mr. Tiernan.

25:03.500 --> 25:06.300
Actually, I'm embarrassed that
this wasn't attended to earlier.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.000
It's a simple request

25:08.400 --> 25:09.800
and I would infer
nothing from it

25:09.800 --> 25:11.000
other than it
would allow us

25:11.100 --> 25:12.600
to do our due
diligence, and...

25:12.700 --> 25:14.200
we could look your wife
in the eye and tell her

25:14.300 --> 25:16.200
that we have left
no stone unturned.

25:16.300 --> 25:18.400
So, Mr. Tiernan, can
Detective Scanlon

25:18.500 --> 25:20.300
take you downstairs?

25:23.000 --> 25:24.200
Is that a "no"?

25:24.700 --> 25:26.300
Yes, that's a "no."

25:27.400 --> 25:30.500
I will not <i>participate
in this farce.</i>

25:30.800 --> 25:32.700
I will not have
my privacy invaded

25:32.800 --> 25:34.700
so you people can
grasp at straws,

25:34.800 --> 25:36.100
and most importantly,

25:36.200 --> 25:38.600
I will not put my wife
through the embarrassment

25:38.700 --> 25:41.200
and the humiliation
and the pain

25:41.400 --> 25:43.800
of knowing that her pleas
for help in this matter

25:43.900 --> 25:46.200
have yielded nothing
but the most...

25:46.900 --> 25:52.000
cynical and simple-minded ideas
about who might be responsible

25:52.100 --> 25:54.300
for her sister's death.

25:58.200 --> 25:59.100
Is that all?

25:59.200 --> 25:59.900
<i>You know I can</i>

26:00.000 --> 26:01.700
compel you to give
us that blood.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.200
Well, by all means,

26:03.300 --> 26:04.900
call the family lawyer.

26:05.300 --> 26:06.500
Gabrielle will
give you the number.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.000
I'm leaving now.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.200
JOE: I let go of the contractor that
we hired to, to, uh...

26:16.300 --> 26:17.700
I'm home! Anyone
want Chinese?

26:17.800 --> 26:19.800
...build the floor
model for trade shows.

26:20.500 --> 26:21.300
Okay, that sounds good.

26:21.400 --> 26:22.800
We'll take new bids
in next week.

26:22.900 --> 26:24.500
I'll, I'll see you
in the morning.

26:25.100 --> 26:25.700
Hi.

26:25.700 --> 26:26.700
You're back early.

26:26.700 --> 26:28.700
Actually, I worked
from home today. Um...

26:28.800 --> 26:30.300
you were in meetings
and I needed to make

26:30.400 --> 26:32.200
an executive parental decision,

26:32.300 --> 26:34.000
and after I made it,
I didn't see the point

26:34.100 --> 26:35.800
of discussing it
until you got home.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.800
Discussing what?
She was upset.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.700
She was embarrassed, and I-I
just couldn't bring myself

26:39.800 --> 26:40.600
to force her
to go to school.

26:40.700 --> 26:42.600
What, you couldn't
bring yourself?

26:42.700 --> 26:43.300
Why? You weren't here.

26:43.300 --> 26:44.500
You didn't see the
look on her face.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.500
She just kept saying that
she couldn't help herself.

26:46.600 --> 26:48.700
Now, I, I think we should
just keep her away from school

26:48.800 --> 26:50.600
until this thing passes.

26:50.700 --> 26:51.900
You want her to
miss more school?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.000
Yeah, as a matter
of fact, I do.

26:53.100 --> 26:55.100
I mean, you know,
p-p-people do it all the time.

26:55.200 --> 26:56.500
Kids get sick,
they stay home.

26:56.600 --> 26:57.800
But she's not sick.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.500
She's not sick, Joe.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.300
This is happening for a reason.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.400
She's drawing these pictures
for a reason.

27:03.500 --> 27:06.300
She can't just miss school
'cause we don't know what it is.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.800
I mean, what if we
never figure it out?

27:11.400 --> 27:13.000
Wait a second. What is this?

27:13.200 --> 27:14.000
What's what?

27:14.200 --> 27:15.900
I don't know. This spot.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.000
On Mr. Enright's chest.

27:18.900 --> 27:21.600
I don't know. It's his,
you know, his nipple.

27:21.700 --> 27:22.700
No, I don't think so.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.400
Look, there's only one.

27:26.100 --> 27:28.000
And look, it's
on all these.

27:28.400 --> 27:30.200
She drew it on
every single picture.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.600
Is it growing?

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
It looks like it's just

27:32.700 --> 27:34.300
changing shape. Look.
This one's like

27:34.400 --> 27:37.800
a little circle, and then here
it looks like an X.

27:40.500 --> 27:42.900
<i>Maybe she's not just
drawing Mr. Enright.</i>

27:43.700 --> 27:45.800
Maybe she's diagnosing him.

27:46.100 --> 27:47.000
<i>REPORTER:
The city of Phoenix</i>

27:47.100 --> 27:49.100
mourned today as one
of its favorite sons,

27:49.200 --> 27:51.000
renowned author Nathan Cafferty,

27:51.000 --> 27:52.600
was laid to rest.

27:52.700 --> 27:55.200
Mr. Cafferty, whose
net worth was estimated

27:55.300 --> 27:58.900
at somewhere between
$15 and $20 million was killed

27:59.000 --> 28:00.800
last week when his car
was struck head-on

28:00.900 --> 28:02.400
by another vehicle.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.900
He is survived by his wife,
Gabrielle, who insists

28:06.000 --> 28:08.200
that rumors that her husband
was working on a new book

28:08.300 --> 28:09.700
at the time of his death were,

28:09.800 --> 28:12.500
<i>to the best of her
knowledge, untrue.</i>

28:23.100 --> 28:25.800
"Our friends often commented
that we made an odd couple,

28:25.900 --> 28:27.600
Gabrielle and I.

28:27.900 --> 28:29.200
She believed with all her heart

28:29.300 --> 28:31.200
that there was far more
to this universe

28:31.300 --> 28:34.500
than the so-called "scientists"
would have us believe.

28:34.700 --> 28:36.500
I, of course, did not.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.300
To the casual observer,
it may have appeared

28:38.400 --> 28:40.700
we had little
in common, but faith,

28:40.800 --> 28:43.800
as it has often
been said, is feminine.

28:44.300 --> 28:46.900
Even the cynic who
believes in nothing

28:47.100 --> 28:49.700
find a girl who believes in him."

29:03.700 --> 29:05.500
FRIST PERSON:An Antobiogtaphy by Nathan Cafferty

29:11.800 --> 29:12.800
I was wrong.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.300
Joel Tiernan isn't
walking around

29:14.400 --> 29:16.500
with the soul of Nathan
Cafferty inside of him.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.600
He's walking around with Nathan
Cafferty's autobiography.

29:20.100 --> 29:21.100
I beg your pardon?

29:21.200 --> 29:21.900
Remember I
told you

29:22.000 --> 29:24.300
that I saw pages raining
down from the sky

29:24.400 --> 29:25.400
the night of the car wreck?

29:25.500 --> 29:26.400
I think that's what it was.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.200
It was Nathan Cafferty's
autobiography.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.400
Joel stole it before
anyone else could read it.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.100
That's how I knew
so much about him.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.000
That's how he could
convince Gabrielle

29:36.100 --> 29:37.500
<i>that he was him.</i>

29:37.700 --> 29:38.700
He had a...

29:39.300 --> 29:42.200
<i>a virtual manual
on how to be him.</i>

29:42.300 --> 29:43.800
Look, I'm sorry.
I know I told you

29:43.900 --> 29:44.800
that Joel was Nathan.

29:44.900 --> 29:45.900
I was wrong.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.800
I fell for the same
scam Gabrielle did.

29:49.500 --> 29:50.900
<i>The only thing I don't know</i>

29:51.000 --> 29:53.800
is, if Joel Tiernan
was always Joel Tiernan,

29:54.100 --> 29:56.200
why would he kill Robin Aronson?

29:56.300 --> 29:58.800
<i>Maybe because he didn't
kill her, Allison.</i>

29:58.900 --> 29:59.900
What?

30:00.000 --> 30:02.500
Lee brought this in a few
minutes before you arrived.

30:03.200 --> 30:04.600
Wait a second. Who's this?

30:04.700 --> 30:06.800
Arthur Kolber. Worked
as a maintenance man

30:06.900 --> 30:10.100
at the cottages where Robin
Aaronson was beaten to death.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.400
I was doing my due diligence on
the hotel staff when I found out

30:13.600 --> 30:14.900
Kolber sexually assaulted

30:15.000 --> 30:17.200
a female friend
two months ago.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.900
<i>I had the lab compare his blood
with the drop that we found</i>

30:21.000 --> 30:22.900
at the scene of Robin
Aaronson's murder, and...

30:23.000 --> 30:24.200
guess what.

30:24.400 --> 30:25.500
A perfect match.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.100
Kolber claims
he cut his hand

30:27.100 --> 30:28.200
doing repairs
at the cottage,

30:28.300 --> 30:29.600
but I don't buy it.

30:29.700 --> 30:31.500
I'm pretty sure this is our guy.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.300
Wait a second.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.700
Even if he didn't kill Robin,

30:35.800 --> 30:37.700
what about everything
he's done to Gabrielle,

30:37.800 --> 30:38.800
everything he's put her through.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.200
Can't we get him on that?

30:40.200 --> 30:41.400
On what?

30:41.800 --> 30:43.000
Gabrielle is a full-grown woman.

30:43.100 --> 30:44.600
If she wants to believe
that she's married

30:44.600 --> 30:45.600
to the ghost
of her dead husband,

30:45.700 --> 30:48.300
well, there's no
law against that.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.000
On the other hand,

30:51.600 --> 30:52.700
I... I'd be lying if I said

30:52.800 --> 30:55.500
that I didn't think that Joel
Tiernan was hiding something.

30:55.800 --> 30:56.800
But here's the thing--

30:56.800 --> 30:58.200
I already owe
the man an apology

30:58.300 --> 31:00.100
for accusing him of
killing his sister-in-law.

31:00.200 --> 31:03.500
<i>I certainly can't also
accuse him of perpetrating</i>

31:03.600 --> 31:05.400
one of the cruelest hoaxes
I've ever heard of,

31:05.500 --> 31:07.000
especially without proof.

31:07.100 --> 31:10.600
You... don't have
any proof, do you?

31:12.400 --> 31:13.400
Yeah, well.

31:13.400 --> 31:14.700
Me neither.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.200
<i>ENRIGHT:
I'm sorry. I don't get it.</i>

31:16.300 --> 31:17.100
Your daughter has done

31:17.100 --> 31:19.600
maybe a dozen more
explicit drawings of me,

31:19.700 --> 31:22.500
and you want to talk to me
about this dot?

31:22.700 --> 31:24.500
I'm not so sure that
it is just a dot.

31:24.600 --> 31:26.800
I think that
maybe it's a mole.

31:28.000 --> 31:30.800
All right, a mole. So?

31:31.200 --> 31:33.300
So... do you?

31:34.400 --> 31:36.500
Do you have a mole
on your chest?

31:36.600 --> 31:37.300
One that's, you know,

31:37.300 --> 31:39.700
in roughly the same
spot as these?

31:39.900 --> 31:41.100
You know what?
I don't really know.

31:41.200 --> 31:43.300
I've got quite a few moles.
Most adults do.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.900
I know, but I'm
talking about this one.

31:46.000 --> 31:48.900
You see how it's
changing shape in
the pictures?

31:49.000 --> 31:50.600
See, it's, like, growing?

31:52.200 --> 31:53.100
I don't mean to alarm you,

31:53.200 --> 31:55.800
but I think that you might want
to see a doctor.

31:56.900 --> 31:58.900
Mr. Dubois, with all due
respect to your daughter,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.500
these are doodles.

32:01.500 --> 32:02.500
Now, are you seriously
suggesting

32:02.600 --> 32:06.000
that I have myself tested
for skin cancer

32:06.100 --> 32:08.800
because of your daughter's
doodles?

32:08.900 --> 32:11.400
Actually, I am.

32:13.900 --> 32:15.200
JOEL:
Robin, you in there?

32:15.300 --> 32:16.900
ROBIN:
The door's open.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.300
I got here as fast as I could.

32:24.900 --> 32:26.600
So why'd you make me drive
all the way out here

32:26.700 --> 32:29.100
just to talk to you, hmm?

32:29.900 --> 32:31.500
What is this place?

32:32.600 --> 32:33.600
This?

32:36.200 --> 32:37.800
This is our place.

32:39.500 --> 32:42.000
It's so good
to see you again, baby.

32:42.100 --> 32:43.700
Robin, what are you doing?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.700
Why are you dressed like that?

32:47.000 --> 32:48.400
Stop!

32:50.600 --> 32:51.800
What's the matter?

32:52.200 --> 32:53.800
I can't do this with you.

32:54.800 --> 32:57.600
I mean, I'm flattered,
don't get me wrong.

32:57.800 --> 33:00.800
But I could never betray
Gabrielle like that.

33:04.900 --> 33:08.500
Huh, that's funny.

33:09.100 --> 33:11.500
You never had a problem
with it before, Nathan.

33:12.200 --> 33:13.600
What did you
just call me?

33:13.700 --> 33:17.200
"Nathan." That's who
you really are, isn't it?

33:18.100 --> 33:19.300
Gabrielle told you.

33:19.400 --> 33:22.900
Yeah, she told me.
She told me all about you.

33:23.900 --> 33:26.100
Of course, if you were
really Nathan,

33:26.200 --> 33:29.700
you'd know about our little
secret, wouldn't you?

33:30.600 --> 33:33.300
You'd know that
you bought me this negligee,

33:33.500 --> 33:35.300
and you'd know that
this place

33:35.800 --> 33:37.700
is where we used to meet

33:38.400 --> 33:39.900
to make love;

33:40.400 --> 33:42.300
to betray my sister.

33:43.500 --> 33:46.000
But you don't remember
anything about us, do you?

33:47.200 --> 33:51.600
Because you're not Nathan,
you're a fraud.

33:52.500 --> 33:53.500
A parasite.

33:53.600 --> 33:55.200
Wait a minute.
You have it wrong.

33:55.300 --> 33:59.500
Shut up! Stop lying.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.900
I don't know how you managed
to trick my sister,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.300
but I'm gonna make sure
she knows the truth.

34:06.400 --> 34:08.400
I'm gonna tell her everything.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.500
Your sister loves me, Robin.

34:16.600 --> 34:17.900
She's happy.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.400
You should have
left us alone.

34:26.699 --> 34:27.900
Mrs. Tiernan?

34:31.000 --> 34:32.800
I was hoping
I could speak
with you.

34:33.600 --> 34:35.600
I'm not sure we have much
to talk about.

34:36.699 --> 34:38.000
Not unless you're here
to apologize

34:38.100 --> 34:40.199
for the way your office
treated my husband.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.300
No, that's not why I'm here.

34:42.600 --> 34:44.900
Obviously, he didn't write
about the affair

34:45.000 --> 34:46.300
in his autobiography.

34:46.400 --> 34:48.500
That's why Joel
didn't know about it.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.500
So when Robin threatened
to expose him,

34:52.199 --> 34:53.800
he didn't really have
a choice but to kill her.

34:53.900 --> 34:55.400
Kill her or lose everything.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.400
No... no, you're wrong.

34:58.500 --> 35:00.300
They, they found
another man's blood

35:00.400 --> 35:01.700
at the crime scene.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.100
A man who worked
at the hotel;

35:03.200 --> 35:05.200
he told the police
he cut his hand.

35:05.500 --> 35:06.500
I can't prove it,

35:06.600 --> 35:08.600
but it think he's
being honest with us.

35:09.300 --> 35:11.500
The truth is, I can't prove
any of this.

35:12.100 --> 35:16.400
But you came to us,
you told us you wanted our help.

35:17.300 --> 35:19.900
And I thought you deserved
to hear the truth

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
even if a jury never does.

35:22.200 --> 35:23.900
Even if it hurts.

35:24.400 --> 35:25.500
Gabrielle,

35:26.700 --> 35:28.000
he's gone.

35:29.000 --> 35:31.200
The man you loved is gone.

35:32.200 --> 35:35.800
And this man isn't him.

35:48.600 --> 35:50.200
Gabby, I'm back.

35:51.300 --> 35:52.900
Welcome home, Nathan.

35:53.300 --> 35:54.200
It's okay.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.100
Um, you don't have to pretend
in front of Mrs. Dubois.

35:57.200 --> 35:59.600
She knows who you really are.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.200
What's she doing here?

36:04.600 --> 36:05.600
After all I've been through

36:05.700 --> 36:06.900
with the district attorney's
office,

36:07.000 --> 36:08.800
why would you let that woman
in our house?

36:08.900 --> 36:10.400
She came here
to talk to me,

36:10.500 --> 36:14.000
to, um, to tell me some things
about you.

36:14.200 --> 36:16.600
Some theories she has about you.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.700
What kind
of theories?

36:19.700 --> 36:21.500
Why would you listen to her?

36:22.900 --> 36:24.400
We've been together
nearly two years.

36:24.400 --> 36:25.700
What could she possibly
tell you

36:25.800 --> 36:27.200
that we don't already know?

36:27.300 --> 36:29.300
Well, that's a great question,
Nathan.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.900
You don't mind if I call you
"Nathan," do you?

36:33.100 --> 36:34.100
You know what?

36:34.400 --> 36:35.800
I was just flipping through

36:35.900 --> 36:37.900
a couple of your books
this morning.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.900
They're beautifully written,
Mr. Cafferty.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.800
You really have a way with words

36:42.900 --> 36:45.600
and a, and a very particular
style.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.500
You're a wonderful writer.

36:47.600 --> 36:48.800
Thank you.

36:51.000 --> 36:55.000
Anyway, I know this is gonna
sound like a strange request,

36:56.000 --> 37:00.200
but we were wondering
if maybe we could get you

37:00.400 --> 37:04.800
to sit here and write something
right here, right now.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.600
Now, why would I want
to do that?

37:08.100 --> 37:10.400
<i>Well, why wouldn't you want
to do it?</i>

37:13.100 --> 37:14.900
You know, it's, it's funny.

37:15.600 --> 37:18.400
In the two years since
you first walked in that door,

37:19.500 --> 37:22.600
I haven't seen you do
a single stitch of work.

37:22.800 --> 37:25.200
I haven't seen you write
anything.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.100
And Nathan,

37:27.200 --> 37:32.800
I mean, the original Nathan,
he was forever writing things,

37:33.500 --> 37:37.100
reading things to me,
showing me things.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.800
So do it for me again, Nathan,
like you used to.

38:18.300 --> 38:19.900
Can you even type?

38:20.600 --> 38:23.200
I think I'd like you to leave
my house now, Mrs. Dubois.

38:23.300 --> 38:25.500
Actually, this is my house...

38:27.600 --> 38:29.800
and I'd like Allison to stay.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.000
She's invited some
of her colleagues over.

38:33.100 --> 38:35.100
They should be here
in a minute.

38:39.500 --> 38:40.600
Mrs. Dubois seems to think

38:40.700 --> 38:44.400
that if the police take a look
around the, uh, the property,

38:44.500 --> 38:45.900
they may turn up that manuscript

38:46.000 --> 38:48.700
that she says you took
from Nathan's car.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.200
We turned the place
upside down.

38:54.600 --> 38:56.400
So far, we found nothing.

38:57.500 --> 38:58.500
I'll give it a few more minutes,

38:58.600 --> 39:01.200
but, uh, I think it's just
about time to pack it in.

39:01.300 --> 39:03.500
So that's it?
He gets away with everything?

39:04.400 --> 39:06.700
Well, everything
except Gabrielle.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.500
She asked
if we'd escort
her husband

39:08.600 --> 39:10.400
from the premises
after we're done.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.200
We might not be able to prove
Joe Tiernan's a murderer,

39:12.300 --> 39:16.800
but at least we got him
out of her life.

40:28.300 --> 40:29.500
Lee!

40:31.900 --> 40:33.200
<i>ALLISON:
Are the girls down?</i>

40:33.200 --> 40:34.800
Two out of three.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.500
Bridgette's still buzzing
about all the nice things

40:37.600 --> 40:38.900
that Mr. Enright had
to say about her

40:39.000 --> 40:40.800
after class today;

40:40.900 --> 40:43.000
how she should feel free
to draw what she wants

40:43.100 --> 40:44.700
when she wants.

40:44.800 --> 40:45.400
Call me crazy.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.900
I think somebody
got some good news

40:46.900 --> 40:48.200
from their dermatologist.

40:48.300 --> 40:49.900
What is this?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.500
It's a little picture
of us that Bridgette drew

40:51.600 --> 40:53.200
before she went to bed.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.500
I looked very closely.
There's no lumps,

40:55.600 --> 40:58.600
growths or vestigial limbs
on either of us,

40:58.700 --> 41:01.100
so I assume we're
in the pink of health.

41:01.900 --> 41:03.200
She even gave us clothes.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.100
Hmm.

41:05.000 --> 41:05.900
Hey, did I tell you

41:06.000 --> 41:08.200
that I took a life-drawing
class in college?

41:08.300 --> 41:10.800
No, you didn't.
Yes, I did.

41:10.900 --> 41:12.100
Yeah?
Mm.

41:12.200 --> 41:14.000
you ever done
any modeling?

41:14.100 --> 41:15.300
Get used to these
boxers, babe,

41:15.400 --> 41:16.300
because they're
never coming off.

41:16.400 --> 41:19.500
Oh, come on.
You have something
against art, hmm?

41:20.100 --> 41:22.500
I'm telling you. You've
got a little something.
Oh, yeah?

41:22.600 --> 41:24.700
I just need to get
my crayons.
(laughs)
