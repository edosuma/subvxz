WEBVTT

00:03.128 --> 00:06.047
RUSH: Destiny.
The design is clearly Ancient.

00:06.131 --> 00:08.341
Launched hundreds of thousands
of years ago.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.009
SCOTT: Where the hell are we?

00:10.094 --> 00:12.053
Several billion light years
from home.

00:12.137 --> 00:16.224
We are on a ship, but we
have no idea where we are
in relation to Earth .

00:16.308 --> 00:20.019
RUSH: This ship could be
the most important discovery
mankind has made

00:20.104 --> 00:21.437
since the stargate itself.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.690
YOUNG:
These are the wrong people
in the wrong place.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.775
SCOTT:
l've got a lot of wounded.
We need to get home.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.611
RUSH: We barely have
enough power to operate
the main systems.

00:28.737 --> 00:31.864
This ship simply doesn't have
the capability to dial Earth .

00:32.281 --> 00:35.952
ln this case
are five Ancient
communication stones.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.038
RUSH : You physically take
control of an individual
at the other end .

00:40.999 --> 00:42.959
Where are you?
ELl : lt's top secret.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.168
But did you get
the letter from . . .

00:44.253 --> 00:46.087
Yeah, the Air Force,
l got it.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.547
You sound like you're
in an airplane.

00:47.631 --> 00:49.215
lt's the kind of thing
l always dreamed of.

00:49.299 --> 00:50.466
Dad ! No, wait!

00:50.551 --> 00:53.177
CHLOE: The ship
is old and damaged.

00:53.262 --> 00:55.304
We were losing air
and somebody had to. . .

00:55.556 --> 00:56.597
He's dead , isn't he?

00:56.682 --> 00:58.099
l didn't choose
my job over you .

00:58.183 --> 00:59.350
lt wasn't just
about the job.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.352
l want nothing more than
to get back here
to be with you .

01:01.437 --> 01:02.895
You made your choice,
Everett.

01:22.875 --> 01:24.667
You are so beautiful .

01:26.837 --> 01:28.004
Don't.

01:31.467 --> 01:34.343
l'm sorry.
l never meant to hurt you .

01:45.355 --> 01:46.689
SCOTT: Colonel. . .

01:50.694 --> 01:52.862
Sorry, sir.
They're waiting .

01:58.118 --> 01:59.285
YOU NG : Sorry.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.870
We're late.

02:17.638 --> 02:18.679
TELFORD: You're late.

02:18.764 --> 02:19.764
lt's my fault.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.484
Thanks for
joining us, Colonel .

02:31.568 --> 02:33.945
Sorry, sir,
l wasn't expecting a party.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.738
We may have figured out
a way to get you home.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.369
Surprise.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.554
Wl LLlAMS: Now, the power flow
issues are obviously
the biggest variable,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.515
but our simulations
are encouraging .

03:02.599 --> 03:05.268
lt's time to take
it to the next level .

03:06.436 --> 03:07.937
Any questions?

03:08.355 --> 03:09.689
lt sounds dangerous.

03:09.773 --> 03:13.276
The lOA fully supports
the implementation
of this plan .

03:13.861 --> 03:14.944
l've seen it
for myself.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.697
The situation
on board is dire
and justifies the risk.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.740
Look, l'm not going
to pretend to understand

03:19.825 --> 03:20.950
everything you guys
are talking about,

03:21.034 --> 03:24.579
but it sounds like
there's a chance that
this plan could end badly.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.540
You want to get
those people home.
So do we.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.833
l'm just saying
maybe these guys

03:28.917 --> 03:30.209
could do a little
more calculating .

03:30.294 --> 03:31.711
The fact is,
we are at the stage

03:31.795 --> 03:34.505
where a practical attempt
is the only way to get
any more hard data.

03:34.590 --> 03:36.299
The goal is
to save lives.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.551
And we don't want
to put the ship at risk.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.053
All we're asking
is that you try.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.974
Well , this is something
l would have to take up with
everyone on board .

03:45.726 --> 03:47.810
Colonel , my office.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.988
Look, if it makes
you feel any better,

03:59.072 --> 04:01.908
Colonel Carter
saved my ass
dozens of times,

04:01.992 --> 04:05.411
using all kinds
of wacky science
l didn't understand .

04:05.495 --> 04:08.789
Well , l can't force people
to do something
they don't want to do.

04:08.874 --> 04:11.167
You're in command
of that ship.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.002
lt's not a democracy.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.421
l'm sorry, sir, it's just. . .
lt's not that simple.

04:15.505 --> 04:17.255
Yes. Yes, it is.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.134
A U nited States
Senator is dead .

04:20.218 --> 04:22.511
H is daughter and
dozens of other people

04:22.596 --> 04:25.765
are trapped
a billion light years
away from home.

04:26.141 --> 04:28.267
The President
wants it done.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.520
Sir, with all due respect. . .

04:31.605 --> 04:33.940
You are being given
a direct order, Colonel .

04:34.024 --> 04:36.025
And l'm telling you that,
regardless of
the consequences

04:36.109 --> 04:40.363
to my standing , l'm going
to take the situation
under advisement.

04:40.530 --> 04:43.074
l will let you know
my decision tomorrow.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.872
Are you sure
you don't want anything?

04:50.290 --> 04:51.666
Oh , l'm fine.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.795
Thank you .

04:55.879 --> 04:57.713
Must be nice
to get out, l imagine.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.465
lt is.

04:59.549 --> 05:03.344
Everyone's very impressed
with how you're holding up
under the circumstances.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.762
l'm doing my best.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.139
You're our eyes
and ears now.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.892
Your life,
certainly the lives
of everyone aboard ,

05:09.977 --> 05:11.227
is the first priority.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.522
But you have to understand ,
there's a lot at stake here.

05:16.692 --> 05:19.485
You passed me up
for promotion four times.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.697
l never really got
a straight answer as to why.

05:22.781 --> 05:26.909
You are a highly trusted ,
well-respected member
of this organization .

05:26.994 --> 05:28.995
You would not
have been on lcarus
in the first place

05:29.079 --> 05:30.121
if you weren't.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.455
The point is,

05:31.540 --> 05:36.210
l know there's no way in hell
you'd be talking to me
right now if you had a choice.

05:36.753 --> 05:39.672
So, please,
can we just cut to the chase?

05:42.259 --> 05:43.551
Make this happen .

05:44.594 --> 05:46.303
l'm not a scientist.
How can l do that?

05:46.388 --> 05:47.471
You have influence.

05:47.556 --> 05:50.141
The people onboard need to
believe it'll get them home.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.019
Even if, in reality,
it can get us all killed .

05:53.103 --> 05:54.478
Not what l've been told .

05:54.563 --> 05:56.230
Why are you pushing so hard?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.441
lf this works,

05:58.734 --> 06:01.986
we think we might be
able to use the data
to re-engineer the process

06:02.070 --> 06:04.613
in one of our ships here,
in this galaxy.

06:04.698 --> 06:07.658
Dial a gate to Destiny
without an lcarus-type planet.

06:07.743 --> 06:10.745
Yes, and get the team
that was supposed to go
in the first place

06:10.829 --> 06:12.455
back onboard .

06:12.539 --> 06:14.415
Now that we know
where the ninth
chevron leads,

06:14.499 --> 06:16.167
this mission has taken on
even more importance.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.668
Why isn't Rush here?

06:17.753 --> 06:18.878
Ah .

06:19.629 --> 06:22.506
We're not convinced
Rush wants to come home.

06:24.134 --> 06:29.430
And do l have to remind you
how much you have to gain
personally in all of this?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.059
Assuming l live.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.568
The ship doesn't have
enough power
to dial back to Earth ,

06:42.652 --> 06:45.654
and as we've seen recently,
when the ship
runs out of juice,

06:45.739 --> 06:48.407
it finds a star
and refills its tanks.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.868
Now, theoretically,
at that time,

06:50.952 --> 06:53.245
the full power of the star
should be available to us.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.289
Star power.
U ltimate wattage, baby.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.583
Yeah , it's brilliant.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.836
lf we can somehow
use the ship

07:00.921 --> 07:03.089
as a conduit and
channel the star's energy

07:03.173 --> 07:04.799
into the gate as we dial . . .

07:04.883 --> 07:06.550
That would do it?

07:07.594 --> 07:09.345
The problem is
the whole ship
is a conduit part.

07:09.429 --> 07:12.765
Well , does anyone know
when the ship will
run out of power again?

07:12.849 --> 07:14.266
lt's tough to tell .

07:14.351 --> 07:18.104
Based on current usage,
probably going to be
several months.

07:18.355 --> 07:20.272
Not if we can drain
the power faster.

07:20.357 --> 07:23.359
Right,
that's part of the plan
that sounded a little vague.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.903
lt's possible.
So, you guys are saying
you're all for this?

07:27.823 --> 07:29.031
Let's see what Rush says.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.450
Given how little we
know about this ship. . .

07:31.535 --> 07:35.079
Can't we at least
try it, and abort
if something goes wrong?

07:35.205 --> 07:38.374
(SlG HS) Well , unfortunately,
the "something
goes wrong" part

07:38.458 --> 07:40.876
would most likely mean
the ship exploding .

07:40.961 --> 07:43.087
Not according to the people
who came up with the idea.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.297
Well , if only all science
was that definitive, Colonel .

07:45.382 --> 07:48.717
You're just going
to have to choose
who you want to believe.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.099
Nothing to worry about.
lt doesn't hurt at all .

07:55.183 --> 07:56.559
Do l look worried?

07:57.102 --> 07:58.394
A little.

07:58.645 --> 08:01.147
J ust trying to figure out
what l'm going to say
to my mom .

08:01.565 --> 08:03.649
My family thinks
l'm on sabbatical in Africa.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.568
So, when it's time
to come back,
what do l do,

08:05.652 --> 08:06.902
click my heels three times?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.238
Rl LEY: There's no way
for you to disconnect
the transmission yourself.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.282
The base needs to be
manually shut down .

08:11.366 --> 08:12.658
There's a device
on the other side as well ,

08:12.742 --> 08:14.994
and turning either off
will sever the connection .

08:15.078 --> 08:16.120
Pretty cool .

08:16.204 --> 08:17.329
Rl LEY: Easiest way
to swap consciousness

08:17.414 --> 08:19.665
with someone
across the universe
l've ever seen .

08:19.791 --> 08:21.542
What's with the Kino?

08:22.169 --> 08:24.003
First time
using the stones.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.629
Very exciting .

08:36.640 --> 08:39.058
Any chance l could get
something else to wear?

08:43.690 --> 08:45.357
Wow, check me out.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.194
Okay, this is weird .

08:48.278 --> 08:50.154
The people we're in
can't hear us, can they?

08:50.238 --> 08:51.280
No.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.325
Wonder what they're doing
with our bodies.

08:54.409 --> 08:55.409
(CH UCKLES)

08:57.412 --> 08:58.871
(WH l RRl NG)

09:04.628 --> 09:05.628
Colonel Telford .

09:05.712 --> 09:07.254
l'll just get right to it.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.758
l've been ordered
to enact the rescue plan
put forward by the lOA.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.551
Rescue plan?
l don't understand .

09:12.636 --> 09:14.553
l've brought
Doctors McCormack
and Williams with me.

09:14.638 --> 09:15.971
l believe you know them .
Yes.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.264
l've already
set them to work.

09:17.349 --> 09:19.141
What about Colonel Young?

09:20.018 --> 09:23.729
Effective immediately,
l'm assuming command
of the Destiny.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.235
YOU NG : You replaced me.
O'N El LL: For now.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.486
Without waiting
to hear my answer?

09:30.570 --> 09:31.654
You were going to say. . .

09:31.738 --> 09:32.821
Give us more time.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.241
Then you were going to be
disobeying a direct order.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.742
Sir. . .
Look,

09:36.826 --> 09:39.411
l offered you command
of the expedition .

09:39.496 --> 09:42.665
You were my first choice,
but you turned it down .

09:43.333 --> 09:45.084
Your exact words,
as l recall , were,

09:45.168 --> 09:47.336
"l don't think
it's still in me, sir."

09:47.462 --> 09:51.006
Well , l'm there now, sir,
whether l like it or not,
whether anyone likes it.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.259
This is wrong ,
and you know it.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.969
l've spent most of my career
looking up to you ,

09:55.053 --> 09:56.428
because you always
did the right thing ,

09:56.513 --> 09:58.264
even if it meant disregarding
the chain of command .

09:58.348 --> 10:01.183
Colonel ,
don't think l like this.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.853
They can't do this to us,
can they?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.063
YOU NG : For now, they have.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.857
Look, l think
it comes down to the fact
that they don't trust Rush ,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.943
and the truth is,
l can't blame them .

10:11.027 --> 10:12.444
What are we supposed to do?

10:12.529 --> 10:14.488
Well , they've given you
permission to see
your families

10:14.572 --> 10:16.657
as long as you guys
follow the rules.

10:16.741 --> 10:18.617
Look, l hate to go there,

10:18.702 --> 10:22.454
but what happens
if they screw up
and the ship explodes?

10:22.539 --> 10:25.082
Most likely,
we will die here, too.

10:27.669 --> 10:31.755
Look, apparently
they're just doing
some preliminary testing ,

10:31.840 --> 10:34.508
information gathering ,
nothing too crazy.

10:34.592 --> 10:39.013
So, what you're saying is,
live it up while we can .

10:53.570 --> 10:55.529
Colonel Telford , l presume.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.031
Sergeant.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.714
He can use the facilities.
That's it.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.969
And what if the power flow
can't be controlled?

11:19.929 --> 11:22.973
Well , if there are any
dangerous fluctuations,
we just shut it down

11:23.058 --> 11:25.142
and allow the ship
to continue powering up.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.853
Early tests show
it should work.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.897
We are not going
to be putting you
in any more danger

11:29.981 --> 11:32.024
than you're already in
just being here.

11:32.108 --> 11:34.234
McCORMACK: From
what l gather, supplies
are desperately short.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.694
And given the condition
of the ship,

11:35.779 --> 11:38.364
it could experience
a fatal breakdown at any time.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.367
No one is trying
to alarm you unduly,

11:41.451 --> 11:44.661
but we can't continue
to scrape by,
barely surviving .

11:44.746 --> 11:48.123
Obviously, we can't say
for sure that this
is going to get you home,

11:49.959 --> 11:51.919
but the best minds
