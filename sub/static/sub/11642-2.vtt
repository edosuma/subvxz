00:02.711 --> 00:04.589
Announcer:

00:12.389 --> 00:14.057
Omoro:
Your name is your shield.

00:14.140 --> 00:17.519
You are Kunta Kinte,
son of Omoro and Binta Kinte.

00:17.602 --> 00:18.603
[man exclaims]

00:18.687 --> 00:21.523
Kintango: What is the warrior's
first responsibility?

00:21.606 --> 00:22.649
I know what I want.

00:22.732 --> 00:25.193
The first duty
of a Mandinka warrior

00:25.276 --> 00:28.238
is to raise a family,
to have children.

00:28.321 --> 00:29.823
Djeliba:
It's time your family paid

00:29.906 --> 00:32.075
for all the trouble
they have caused me, Kunta.

00:32.158 --> 00:34.411
- Run!
- [screaming]

00:34.494 --> 00:36.246
Hyah!

00:38.915 --> 00:40.417
[horse squealing]

00:43.086 --> 00:45.797
Sell the boy to the English
with the other captives.

00:45.880 --> 00:47.841
Take as many of his friends
as you can.

00:47.924 --> 00:49.050
- [skin sizzles]
- [screams]

00:51.136 --> 00:52.262
[shouts in native language]

00:55.432 --> 00:56.558
Jinna!

01:01.563 --> 01:04.232
Connelly:
You can't buy a slave.

01:04.315 --> 01:06.901
You got to make a slave.

01:06.985 --> 01:08.069
I am Kunta Kinte.

01:08.153 --> 01:09.696
That's not your name.

01:09.779 --> 01:11.865
- [screams]
- Toby's your name.

01:11.948 --> 01:15.160
Say your name so you know
this ain't Africa.

01:15.243 --> 01:19.205
This is Virginia,
and you're the property of John Waller,

01:19.289 --> 01:21.458
like the horses and hogs,
nothing more!

01:22.917 --> 01:24.836
[dogs barking]

01:26.004 --> 01:27.172
[horse neighs]

01:27.255 --> 01:28.256
[grunts]

01:28.339 --> 01:30.341
You can't trust Fiddler. Sell him.

01:30.425 --> 01:32.886
- I'll buy him.
- This is none of your business, brother.

01:32.969 --> 01:34.888
The amount of money
that you owe me, brother,

01:34.971 --> 01:36.598
the entire estate
is my business.

01:38.349 --> 01:40.769
Tell me your name!
Say it, damn you!

01:40.852 --> 01:42.395
Kunta Kinte.

01:42.479 --> 01:43.897
[whip cracks]

01:43.980 --> 01:44.981
Toby!

01:45.106 --> 01:46.232
[screams]

01:46.316 --> 01:47.567
He said it.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.402
[weakly] Toby.

01:58.119 --> 01:59.329
Haley: For 10 years,

01:59.412 --> 02:04.083
not a day went by that Kunta wasn't
looking to escape again.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.837
And when that opportunity arose,
he took it.

02:14.385 --> 02:16.679
- [leaves rustling]
- [Kunta panting]

02:16.763 --> 02:18.306
[branches cracking]

02:19.724 --> 02:20.725
[gunshots]

02:22.352 --> 02:24.395
Soldiers! Soldiers!

02:24.479 --> 02:25.855
[horse neighs]

02:25.939 --> 02:27.315
[grunts]

02:29.234 --> 02:30.610
[horse neighs]

02:30.693 --> 02:32.111
Soldier! Soldier!

02:32.195 --> 02:33.780
Help!

02:33.863 --> 02:35.990
Help me!

02:36.074 --> 02:38.284
Soldier! Soldier!

02:39.828 --> 02:41.579
[horse snorts]

02:41.663 --> 02:42.914
I will fight for your king.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.040
[gunshot]

02:48.378 --> 02:50.171
[distorted] Toby!

02:52.173 --> 02:54.342
Get back here,
you skulkin' ape!

02:54.425 --> 02:56.094
[horse whickers]

03:12.527 --> 03:14.195
[choking]

03:17.490 --> 03:19.158
My name...

03:19.242 --> 03:20.785
is Kunta Kinte!

03:20.869 --> 03:22.245
[gasping]

03:26.875 --> 03:28.793
[gasping stops]

03:30.795 --> 03:32.130
[horse neighs]

03:34.716 --> 03:36.467
Surrender your weapon.

03:36.551 --> 03:38.553
[horse neighing]

03:50.523 --> 03:53.526
You are English.
You know Juffure.

03:53.610 --> 03:55.028
I am a Mandinka warrior.

03:55.111 --> 03:57.113
Mandinka, eh?

03:57.238 --> 03:59.365
I will kill many Americans
for your king!

04:03.536 --> 04:05.246
You'll have to walk.

04:05.330 --> 04:08.124
Head east
into the Great Dismal Swamp

04:08.249 --> 04:10.501
and meet up with Lord Dunmore's
Ethiopian regiment.

04:10.585 --> 04:13.254
You'll be given food, shelter,
and a letter of manumission.

04:13.338 --> 04:15.632
What is
a "letter of manumission"?

04:15.715 --> 04:17.595
It's the piece of paper
that states you're free.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.014
And slave masters
will believe this paper?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.766
They will in England.
Hyah!

04:24.849 --> 04:26.100
[horse neighs]

04:26.184 --> 04:27.977
Single file!

04:28.061 --> 04:29.604
[soldier shouts]

04:31.856 --> 04:33.232
Man: Forward!

04:33.316 --> 04:35.568
[man coughing]

04:39.530 --> 04:41.991
Touch him and you'll look
the same soon enough.

04:42.075 --> 04:44.786
Better off being actually dead
than living dead.

04:44.869 --> 04:48.498
- What sickness do they have?
- The pox.

04:48.581 --> 04:51.668
- A new recruit?
- He's a Mandinka warrior.

04:51.751 --> 04:55.129
Says he wants to fight for us
against the Americans.

04:55.213 --> 04:56.923
What's your name?

04:57.006 --> 05:00.301
Go on.
You're safe here.

05:00.385 --> 05:05.264
It was the English who captured me
and brought me to this country.

05:05.348 --> 05:06.891
Now you tell me
I am "safe."

05:08.351 --> 05:09.602
Quite so.

05:10.687 --> 05:12.480
Quite so.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.067
You'll be wanting a meal
and a good night's rest.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.486
Lord Dunmore will be around
in the morning with orders.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.488
I wish you well.

05:27.912 --> 05:29.912
Man: My people fought
three wars with the white men

05:29.956 --> 05:31.290
and signed three peace treaties.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.959
All brought death.

05:33.042 --> 05:35.920
Why you fightin' for them?
You already free.

05:36.004 --> 05:38.172
I'm free to watch
white planters take our land.

05:38.256 --> 05:41.592
Kill more animals than they can eat.
Leave us nothing.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.262
Can you see good enough
to fight?

05:44.345 --> 05:47.223
I see good enough.
I found my way here.

05:47.348 --> 05:50.143
Man: Don't think about
even their own people.

05:50.226 --> 05:53.688
I figure I can at least spook
some of them rebels.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.732
They don't remember
where they came from.

05:55.815 --> 05:57.608
My Massa put out
his cigar in my eye

05:57.692 --> 05:59.694
'cause I cried when he sold
my ma and sisters.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.237
[indistinct conversations]

06:01.362 --> 06:03.906
I ran away the next day.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.742
You have children?

06:08.619 --> 06:11.164
[sighs]

06:11.247 --> 06:15.960
I have a younger brother your age.

06:16.044 --> 06:21.007
He, my mother, and my father
are still in Juffure.

06:22.592 --> 06:24.052
Africa.

06:24.135 --> 06:26.888
I have not seen them
in almost 10 years.

06:28.723 --> 06:30.367
Man: When the governor
of Virginia comes tomorrow,

06:30.391 --> 06:32.393
he'll give us our guns
and our freedom papers.

06:32.477 --> 06:33.936
- Mm. Mm.
- This governor...

06:34.020 --> 06:35.229
rules all of Virginia?

06:35.313 --> 06:38.483
- Every last plot and parcel.
- Then he must have slaves.

06:38.566 --> 06:39.817
Did he free them, too?

06:39.901 --> 06:42.028
Man: English say white man
who fights for King George

06:42.111 --> 06:43.696
can keep his slaves.

06:43.780 --> 06:45.656
[indistinct chatter]

06:49.535 --> 06:51.287
That says
"liberty to slaves."

06:52.872 --> 06:54.832
That says
"liberty to slaves."

06:54.916 --> 06:56.793
- Do you know your size?
- Big.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.252
[indistinct chatter]

06:58.336 --> 07:00.546
That says
"liberty to slaves."

07:00.630 --> 07:02.298
Ruck up, men!
Ruck up!

07:02.423 --> 07:04.133
There's much work ahead.

07:04.217 --> 07:06.427
Prepare yourselves
for glorious battle.

07:06.511 --> 07:09.597
Lord Dunmore will issue
his orders shortly.

07:24.612 --> 07:26.697
Thank you.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.535
I am Kunta Kinte.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.620
Carleton.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.415
Okay.

07:36.499 --> 07:39.460
Your mother and sisters

07:39.544 --> 07:42.505
will be very proud
of you, Carleton.

07:50.304 --> 07:51.347
Mm.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.395
[indistinct chatter]

07:57.478 --> 08:01.149
Dunmore: You are to march east
to the Great Dismal Swamp.

08:01.232 --> 08:02.692
Rebel factions
have taken the bridge

08:02.775 --> 08:05.736
that serves as the passageway
through to the Carolinas.

08:05.820 --> 08:09.240
Your orders
are to take that bridge.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.159
Where are our guns?

08:11.242 --> 08:12.743
[crowd murmurs]

08:12.827 --> 08:16.706
We have encountered heavy rebel
resistance along crucial supply routes

08:16.789 --> 08:19.625
in Charleston
and New York Harbor.

08:19.709 --> 08:22.044
Our armaments are delayed.

08:22.128 --> 08:25.673
You will instead
be armed with pikes.

08:25.756 --> 08:27.133
- [crowd murmuring]
- Man: Pikes?

08:27.216 --> 08:28.926
If you want your freedom,

08:29.010 --> 08:30.887
you'll fight
with what we give you.

08:30.970 --> 08:32.489
Will you be fighting
on the bridge with us?

08:32.513 --> 08:34.472
You are not to question
his Lordship's orders...

08:34.557 --> 08:38.519
I am your commander, who serves
at the pleasure of the King,

08:38.602 --> 08:41.230
who imparts our purpose.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.857
Therefore,
it would be imprudent of me

08:43.941 --> 08:46.861
to march into battle with you.

08:46.944 --> 08:48.196
Then may we have your gun?

08:48.279 --> 08:50.072
[crowd murmurs in agreement]

08:50.156 --> 08:51.532
[thunder rumbles]

08:51.616 --> 08:53.951
Why are you not advancing
across the bridge?

08:54.035 --> 08:57.079
Without guns, we cannot defend
ourselves in this fog.

08:57.163 --> 08:59.248
You were all given orders.

08:59.332 --> 09:01.792
If you do not follow them,
you will be charged with mutiny

09:01.876 --> 09:04.420
and summarily executed
for desertion.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.173
Now secure this bridge!

09:07.256 --> 09:08.591
Company!

09:08.674 --> 09:10.885
Will advance at the ordinary!

09:10.968 --> 09:13.471
Forward, march!

09:20.228 --> 09:22.480
Stay behind me.

09:23.814 --> 09:25.733
[soldiers murmuring]

09:25.816 --> 09:27.318
[thunder rumbles]

09:27.401 --> 09:30.112
Grenadier Captain:
Advance. Charge bayonets.

09:30.196 --> 09:31.781
Take the bridge.

09:34.450 --> 09:36.911
Charge bayonets.
Take the damn bridge!

09:36.994 --> 09:38.704
Huzzah!

09:42.291 --> 09:45.544
[planks clunking]

09:45.628 --> 09:47.797
[thunder claps]

09:47.880 --> 09:50.341
[wood creaking]

09:53.886 --> 09:55.137
Man: Shh!

09:58.391 --> 10:00.685
[men shouting]

10:00.768 --> 10:03.688
Hold your ground!

10:03.771 --> 10:05.273
Kunta: Go back!

10:05.356 --> 10:07.066
Shoot anyone
who leaves this bridge!

10:07.149 --> 10:08.609
[gunshots, soldiers screaming]

10:11.612 --> 10:13.155
- Can you swim?
- Huh?

10:13.239 --> 10:14.699
- Can you swim?!
- Y-Yeah.

10:20.329 --> 10:22.957
[soldiers shouting]

10:26.335 --> 10:28.921
[projectiles whistling]

10:29.005 --> 10:31.632
[thunder rumbles]

10:32.675 --> 10:33.968
[muffled gunshots]

10:40.808 --> 10:42.977
[thunder rumbling]

10:48.316 --> 10:50.067
[crickets chirping]

11:07.335 --> 11:09.003
[snake hisses]

11:09.086 --> 11:10.504
[indistinct shouting]

11:15.009 --> 11:17.219
There are snakes?!
[panting]

11:27.355 --> 11:29.273
Stay here.
Stay here.

11:29.357 --> 11:30.918
From now on,
we don't fight for English.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.069
We fight for ourselves.
You understand?

11:33.152 --> 11:34.695
Now we look for a place
that's safe.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.532
[thunder rumbling]

11:39.825 --> 11:42.328
[breathing shakily]

11:46.999 --> 11:48.876
[water sloshing]

11:53.047 --> 11:55.716
I hear them.
Let's go that way.

12:03.557 --> 12:05.726
[crickets chirping]

12:07.853 --> 12:09.563
[grunts]

12:11.273 --> 12:14.318
[gagging]

12:14.402 --> 12:16.278
[wings flapping]

12:31.127 --> 12:33.796
Carleton.
Carleton.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.514
[breathing heavily]

12:43.597 --> 12:45.599
[somber music playing]

12:47.059 --> 12:49.520
[sighs]

12:49.603 --> 12:51.605
[man vocalizing]

13:00.614 --> 13:02.283
[sniffles]

13:18.799 --> 13:21.510
[branches snap]

13:21.594 --> 13:23.971
[shouting,
dogs barking in distance]

13:26.682 --> 13:28.893
Man:
Let them hounds loose!

13:28.976 --> 13:30.853
[thunder rumbling]

13:47.495 --> 13:49.330
[drum music playing]

14:05.513 --> 14:07.389
[birds chirping]

14:13.687 --> 14:15.564
[music ends]

14:20.110 --> 14:21.987
[dramatic music plays]

14:27.409 --> 14:28.869
Man:
Keep those barrels moving!

14:28.953 --> 14:30.871
[horse neighs]

14:40.631 --> 14:44.385
# Oh, how come me here? #

14:44.468 --> 14:48.347
# Oh, how come me here? #

14:48.430 --> 14:51.642
# Oh, how come me here? #

14:51.725 --> 14:54.645
# Oh, oh, River Jordan #

14:54.728 --> 14:57.481
# Farewell, hard times #

14:57.565 --> 14:59.900
# Farewell, farewell #

14:59.984 --> 15:02.152
# Farewell, dark times #

15:02.236 --> 15:04.196
# Farewell, farewell #

15:04.280 --> 15:07.783
# Ain't gon'
see ya no more #

15:07.908 --> 15:10.452
# Farewell, dark times #

15:10.536 --> 15:12.413
[in distance]
# Farewell, farewell #

15:12.496 --> 15:15.499
# Ain't gon' see ya no more #

15:25.759 --> 15:30.055
Don't you look dashing
in that costume, Toby.

15:30.139 --> 15:31.640
Unh-unh!

15:31.724 --> 15:33.183
Get him up here.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.479
What you got here?

15:44.236 --> 15:46.655
Oooh.
Just like the poster said.

15:46.739 --> 15:48.574
You sure do got
the treasure map here.

15:48.657 --> 15:49.950
[chuckles]

15:51.660 --> 15:53.037
What's this writin' say?

15:54.496 --> 15:55.831
"Liberty to slaves."

15:55.956 --> 15:58.876
[laughing] "Liberty to slaves"!

15:58.959 --> 16:00.210
- [laughter]
- Phew!

16:00.294 --> 16:03.380
Man alive!
I done seen an elephant.

16:03.464 --> 16:05.341
I ought to get something sewed
on my jacket.

16:05.424 --> 16:07.468
How 'bout
"Friend to the slaves,"

16:07.551 --> 16:10.971
seein' as I went to Hell across lots
to bring you back home.

16:11.055 --> 16:12.556
Hmm?

16:12.640 --> 16:14.391
Tie him up.

16:16.018 --> 16:17.770
Let's go.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.273
Covey:
But first, the law says

16:21.357 --> 16:23.317
that I got to fix things

16:23.400 --> 16:25.861
so that you don't wander off
no more.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.196
No.

16:27.279 --> 16:29.531
- Shh! Just relax.
- No! No!

16:29.615 --> 16:30.866
- You're spent, Toby.
- No!

16:30.991 --> 16:32.260
- No more runnin' for you, boy.
- No!

16:32.284 --> 16:33.744
No!
No, please!

16:33.827 --> 16:34.870
[grunts]

16:34.995 --> 16:36.997

16:43.170 --> 16:44.981

- [screams]

16:51.345 --> 16:53.055
[screaming, chains jangle]

16:54.556 --> 16:58.018
Kunta, Allah sends us dreams
to guide us.

16:58.102 --> 16:59.496
- Omoro: Your name is your spirit.
- Come.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.914
Tell me your name.
Tell me, damn you!

17:00.938 --> 17:02.147
- Come.
- Your name...

17:02.231 --> 17:03.232
- Kunta Kinte!
- Toby!

17:03.315 --> 17:04.733
- Say it!
- ...is your shield.

17:04.817 --> 17:09.238
As soon as he's mobile,
he's going in my pocket.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.074
It don't matter
what the Massa call you.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.660
You keep your true name
inside you.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.079
Silla: Dream of seeing
your family again.

17:17.162 --> 17:18.306
[man and woman vocalizing
discordantly]

17:18.329 --> 17:19.957
Will you do that for me, Kunta?

17:20.040 --> 17:22.667
Kunta: Guide me, Fa.
Be with me, Ma.

17:22.751 --> 17:23.877
How did you find me?

17:25.587 --> 17:27.256
- [singing in foreign language]
- [yells]

17:28.424 --> 17:31.260
You are a Mandinka.

17:31.343 --> 17:33.137
You will always be a Mandinka.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.930
May Allah guide you.

17:35.055 --> 17:37.975
You got to live.
You hear me, Kunta Kinte?

17:38.058 --> 17:39.935
Kunta Kinte.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.689
- Always remember who you are.
- Kintango: May Allah bless you.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.315
May Allah keep you.

17:45.399 --> 17:48.360
William:
Fever's finally broken.

17:48.444 --> 17:50.362
[insects chirping]

17:52.531 --> 17:55.451
I'm so relieved
you gon' make it, Toby.

17:55.534 --> 17:57.411
My name is Belle.

17:59.872 --> 18:02.124
[woman speaking in distance]

18:02.207 --> 18:03.751
[animal bleats in distance]

18:03.834 --> 18:05.627
I'm using my medicine.

18:05.711 --> 18:07.713
Works better than Dr. Waller's.

18:09.381 --> 18:11.258
[door opens]

18:12.801 --> 18:14.219
Let me die.

18:17.222 --> 18:19.141
[laughs]

18:20.684 --> 18:22.060
Boy, you almost did die.

18:22.144 --> 18:26.815
After all the... the caring
that... that Belle's done done for you?

18:26.899 --> 18:32.362
After all the beggin' and the pr... prayin'
that I had to do for you?

18:32.446 --> 18:36.366
Heaven must've heard me 'cause we...
we here, on Doc Waller's farm.

18:36.450 --> 18:39.828
His brother John owed him
a heap of money, so...

18:39.912 --> 18:43.624
Doc took me and you
as a start payment.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.170
So you listen to Belle.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.756
She gon' get you walking again
real soon. Right, Belle?

18:50.839 --> 18:52.341
Where will I walk to?

18:54.635 --> 18:55.886
Huh?

19:00.307 --> 19:01.558
He just needs rest.

19:01.642 --> 19:02.726
- Uh-huh.
- Uh.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.190
[latch clicks]

19:13.987 --> 19:16.281
Every day, after workin' hard,

19:16.365 --> 19:19.576
he come here,
and he hold your hands.

19:19.660 --> 19:22.371
He call you
"his warrior son."

19:28.168 --> 19:30.003
[insects chirping]

19:39.847 --> 19:41.431
[Scottish accent]
I read my Bible.

19:41.515 --> 19:43.892
And God sends signs.
That's a truth.

19:43.976 --> 19:48.522
Doctor Waller's driver ran off
two weeks 'fore you got here.

19:48.605 --> 19:49.940
How came that to be?

19:50.023 --> 19:52.317
Word gets round.

19:52.401 --> 19:56.780
You gonna be trouble.
I know it.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.199
A good man named Connelly
got killed.

19:59.283 --> 20:03.287
Word floatin' on the wind
is that was you.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.830
I am ready for you.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.458
[shouting, grunting]

20:12.254 --> 20:13.589
You don't have to worry, Massa.

20:13.672 --> 20:16.508
I'm here watchin' him,
just like Dr. Waller told me.

20:19.845 --> 20:22.723
- Then you watch him.
- Yes, Massa.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.642
[Kunta groaning]

20:33.567 --> 20:36.111
Swallow this.
No fuss.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.330
[door creaks, closes]

20:46.413 --> 20:48.165
William:
I'll see you next Wednesday.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.791
Mind that cold, now.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.543
Hyah!

20:51.627 --> 20:53.462
[slaves singing indistinctly]

20:53.545 --> 20:55.964
[metal clanking]

20:58.258 --> 21:00.052
[door opens]

21:11.480 --> 21:12.731
Toby.

21:14.608 --> 21:15.859
I had this made for you.

21:15.943 --> 21:20.322
It'll help you balance till you're strong
enough to walk on your own.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.823
And I asked the blacksmith

21:21.907 --> 21:23.867
to fit these old boots here
special for you.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.202
Hmm?

21:26.453 --> 21:28.330
Well...

21:28.413 --> 21:31.291
let's just try 'em on,
see how they fit.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.961
Ona, come help me with this.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.011
Okay.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.433
[gasps]

22:08.245 --> 22:10.414
You might have fooled Fiddler,
but you don't fool me.

22:10.497 --> 22:14.918
He say you was a... a great
warrior in Africa.

22:15.002 --> 22:17.838
What kind of warrior
waits to die?!

22:17.921 --> 22:20.757
I seen plenty of men
far worse off than you...

22:20.841 --> 22:25.345
no strip of skin left on they back,
overseer beat them near to death.

22:25.429 --> 22:28.098
Seen women worked to death,

22:28.181 --> 22:32.352
girls' bodies used up hard...
no older than children.

22:32.436 --> 22:34.271
But they found a way to get up.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.398
They was warriors.

22:36.481 --> 22:37.774
Not you.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.071
I tell you what.

22:45.073 --> 22:48.493
I will never let you treat me
like a Massa in a temper.

22:48.577 --> 22:50.454
[boots thud]

22:53.540 --> 22:55.417
[door closes]

23:06.636 --> 23:08.513
[boots scrape]

23:11.266 --> 23:12.517
- Let's go.
- Fiddler!

23:12.601 --> 23:14.227
Ow!

23:14.311 --> 23:16.354
Fiddler, it hurts!
Fiddler!

23:16.438 --> 23:18.065
It ain't hurt me at all.

23:18.148 --> 23:19.709
- [screaming]
- I guess I'm the fool for livin'.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.401
- That what you sayin'?
- Fiddler!

23:21.485 --> 23:23.463
I know I'm a fool for puttin' up
with all your nonsense.

23:23.487 --> 23:25.781
Open up the gate, boy.

23:28.408 --> 23:29.951
Tell me.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.289
[grunts]

23:34.414 --> 23:37.834
And no matter how much
I may play my fiddle for 'em,

23:37.918 --> 23:39.878
they ain't ever
gonna tear me down.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.922
You right.

23:42.005 --> 23:44.257
I ain't never been free.

23:44.341 --> 23:45.926
And I may never be.

23:46.009 --> 23:47.385
But I tell you this.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.764
Your ornery Mandinka ways,

23:50.847 --> 23:52.390
they done started to rub off on me.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.102
- [grunts]
- So Imma leave you right here.

23:55.185 --> 23:56.853
And you gonna get
your own self up.

23:56.937 --> 24:01.483
You gonna walk right on back to the house,
and you gon' say sorry to Miss Belle.

24:01.566 --> 24:04.277
I ain't got nothing else
to do with you no more.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.363

[hooves pounding]

24:09.783 --> 24:11.409
[neighs]

24:11.493 --> 24:16.248
I know you have been taught to ride
by your family, but not a horse like this.

24:16.331 --> 24:18.083
Who will ride him?

24:18.166 --> 24:19.584
Oh, Kunta volunteers.

24:20.669 --> 24:22.671
[horse snorting]

24:37.978 --> 24:39.813
[horse whinnies]

24:43.525 --> 24:47.237
Omoro:
You are a Mandinka.

24:47.320 --> 24:51.908
You will always be a Mandinka,
Kunta Kinte.

24:53.743 --> 24:56.746
Always remember who you are.

24:56.830 --> 24:58.415

Kunta Kinte.

25:31.656 --> 25:33.658
Juffure.
[breathing heavily]

25:35.118 --> 25:36.828
In the kingdom of Niumi.

25:42.626 --> 25:45.003
On the Kamby Bolongo.

- Shh.

26:59.286 --> 27:00.537
Thank you...

27:02.497 --> 27:04.457
Belle...

27:32.777 --> 27:35.238
[sighs] Hitch up my horse,
would you, Spalding?

27:38.658 --> 27:39.909
[sack thuds]

27:41.828 --> 27:45.373
Three stops today, Belle,
so late home.

27:45.457 --> 27:48.168
- A cold supper will be fine.
- Yes, Massa.

27:48.251 --> 27:51.004
It's a shame, you havin'
to drive yourself.

27:51.087 --> 27:54.966
Yes, well, God willing,
the militia will track down Luther.

27:55.050 --> 27:57.177
And if not, I shall
have to buy another driver.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.095
- Go! Go!
- [horse neighing]

27:59.179 --> 28:00.430

Hey! Hey!
Hey.

Man: Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:18.615 --> 28:20.033

- Shh.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.202
[snorts]

28:22.285 --> 28:23.536
What's he doing?

28:24.954 --> 28:27.707
- Goodness.
- Mm-hmm.

28:27.791 --> 28:29.250
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

28:29.334 --> 28:31.753
Woman: Toby done
calmed him down. Ooh-whee.

28:31.836 --> 28:33.380
[speaking foreign language]

28:35.173 --> 28:36.883
- Touch him.
- Mm.

28:36.966 --> 28:38.218
I've never seen...

28:38.301 --> 28:40.095
[speaking foreign language]

28:45.558 --> 28:47.936
[sighs]

28:50.563 --> 28:53.525
Hyah. Hyah!

29:00.782 --> 29:02.826
Spalding: Quit staring
and get back to work!

29:05.328 --> 29:07.288
[chuckles]

29:08.581 --> 29:10.417
How on Earth
did you manage that?

29:10.500 --> 29:11.918
I knew he was scared.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.294
Toby's got a gift for horses.

29:13.378 --> 29:14.629
Real special touch, Massa.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.131
- Get back in the field!
- Ah, ah.

29:16.214 --> 29:17.715
Steady on, Spalding.

29:17.799 --> 29:19.735
What did you think of Toby's
special touch with the horse?

29:19.759 --> 29:21.010
It was astonishing, no?

29:21.094 --> 29:22.512
Why, it's just dumb luck, sir.

29:22.595 --> 29:25.432
The horse is probably
smarter than an African.

29:25.515 --> 29:27.767
[chuckles] Good God, man.

29:27.851 --> 29:32.105
The Semites brought horses to Africa
when they defeated the Egyptians

29:32.188 --> 29:33.916
more than 2,000 years
before the birth of Christ.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.210
It never fails to amaze me that you've
traveled the world, Spalding,

29:36.234 --> 29:38.236
and seem to know
nothing about it.

29:38.319 --> 29:39.571
It's sad, really.

29:39.654 --> 29:42.073
Toby could drive
for you, too, Massa.

29:42.157 --> 29:45.368
You could see more people,
not get tired.

29:45.452 --> 29:47.221
Yes, I guess I wouldn't
have to buy another driver.

29:47.245 --> 29:48.329
Mm.

29:48.413 --> 29:50.165
Or a horse trainer.

29:50.248 --> 29:51.968
It would appear
that I have both right here.

29:52.041 --> 29:53.501
Well done, Toby.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.105
Hitch up the horse, Spalding.
I'm late.

29:57.422 --> 30:00.467
Yes. Well done.

30:11.102 --> 30:13.104
[breathing heavily]

30:15.857 --> 30:17.650
Hmm.

30:29.162 --> 30:30.455
Shh.

30:36.461 --> 30:38.004
- [rifle taps]
- [gasps]

30:39.380 --> 30:40.632
Come on.

30:43.051 --> 30:47.972
Luther, the carriage driver,
he was a quiet one...

30:48.056 --> 30:49.891
like you...

30:49.974 --> 30:52.477
all the while hatching
a devious plan.

30:52.560 --> 30:56.314
Stabbed two militiamen,
the bloodthirsty bastard.

30:56.397 --> 30:59.526
Now he's quiet again.

30:59.609 --> 31:01.819
[rope creaks]

31:01.903 --> 31:04.989
What I'm wonderin' is,

31:05.073 --> 31:07.617
do I save myself the trouble
of having to look for you,

31:07.700 --> 31:11.037
seein' as I got
you here now, Toby?

31:11.120 --> 31:13.039
Toby! Toby!

31:13.122 --> 31:15.667
- Get back to the farm!
- I just came to remind Toby

31:15.750 --> 31:18.253
that Mrs. Malloy's baby
could come at any time.

31:18.336 --> 31:22.215
Toby, you remember Massa says
you might have to drive him tonight.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.676
Massa'll be awful vexed
if you ain't ready to drive him.

31:24.759 --> 31:27.387
Tell Massa I'll be ready.

31:31.933 --> 31:35.353
And you'll catch hell from me
if you keep the Master waiting.

31:42.235 --> 31:44.195
[sobs]

31:46.447 --> 31:48.324
[crying]

32:00.461 --> 32:02.338
[rope creaking]

32:13.516 --> 32:18.104
[crows cawing]

32:24.736 --> 32:27.822
Toby...

32:27.947 --> 32:29.699
stay here in the wagon.

32:33.494 --> 32:35.496
[ominous music plays]

32:37.624 --> 32:38.875

32:57.435 --> 32:59.395
[bell tolling]

32:59.479 --> 33:01.314
[men cheering, shouting]

33:03.483 --> 33:04.942
You there!

33:05.026 --> 33:07.612
- What's all the carousing about?
- The war's done!

33:07.695 --> 33:10.573
British troops have withdrawn
from Charleston and Savannah!

33:10.657 --> 33:13.284
We're free!
No more royal subjects are we!

33:13.368 --> 33:14.786
Long live freedom!

33:14.869 --> 33:16.287
[all cheer]

33:16.371 --> 33:18.081
Long live freedom!

33:18.164 --> 33:21.084
[bell ringing]

33:21.167 --> 33:23.795
[plucking strings]
Ain't that wonderful?

33:23.878 --> 33:25.421
White folk finally got
they freedom.

33:25.505 --> 33:27.715
[laughs]

33:27.799 --> 33:31.928
What will happen to the slaves
who fought in the Continental Army?

33:32.011 --> 33:34.013
I'm sure General Washington
will find them work.

33:34.097 --> 33:35.431
Alongside his other slaves.

33:35.515 --> 33:37.433
[chuckles]

33:40.687 --> 33:41.938
Sound about right to you?

33:42.021 --> 33:44.023
Sounds real fine.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.277
Spalding: Fiddler!

33:48.361 --> 33:52.281
Dr. Waller's guests want to hear you
scratchin' on your fiddle!

33:52.365 --> 33:54.534
Yessuh!

33:56.035 --> 33:59.205
Lord must've been in a powerful bad mood
when He, uh, made white folk.

33:59.288 --> 34:02.333
He must've stubbed his toe.

34:02.417 --> 34:03.876
- "Ow!"
- [laughs]

34:03.960 --> 34:06.838
Tripped over his dog.
Hit his head on a shovel.

34:06.921 --> 34:08.464
[laughing]

34:08.547 --> 34:11.342
[chuckles] And when
He was cursing up a storm,

34:11.426 --> 34:13.386
He spat out the word.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.679
[whispering] White folk!

34:15.763 --> 34:17.264
[laughter]

34:17.348 --> 34:19.600
Spalding:
Fiddler, get moving!

34:19.684 --> 34:21.476
- Go on, Fiddler.
- Yessuh!

34:21.561 --> 34:24.147
[laughing]

34:24.230 --> 34:27.984
Now my foot's starting to hurt.

34:28.067 --> 34:29.860
Rain must be coming.

34:29.944 --> 34:33.197
I been putting some yarn aside
for you, knit you some socks

34:33.281 --> 34:35.199
so your boots will fit
more comfortable.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.495
You know, my Kintango
came to me in a dream, huh?

34:41.371 --> 34:43.666
And he said that...
[sighs]

34:43.750 --> 34:48.087
A warrior must learn
to defeat pain, mm?

34:49.464 --> 34:51.132
[chuckles]

34:51.215 --> 34:52.759
Now I stand in the downpours.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.719
[laughs] Oh, Lord.

34:54.802 --> 34:57.764
You and your African ghosts.
[chuckles]

34:57.847 --> 34:59.474
They're not ghosts.

34:59.557 --> 35:03.352
- They're my people visiting me.
- Mm-hmm.

35:03.436 --> 35:05.521
Telling me things.

35:05.605 --> 35:09.901
And what do these
African ghosts tell you?

35:09.984 --> 35:12.236
They tell me the world
is bigger than this farm.

35:12.320 --> 35:14.238
Oh, well, of course it is.

35:14.322 --> 35:17.283
We won't never see it,
and you always thinking about it

35:17.366 --> 35:20.787
just piles on the agony
and makes you loon crazy.

35:20.870 --> 35:23.790
And you not thinking about it
makes your life small.

35:23.873 --> 35:26.417
What you know about my life?

35:26.501 --> 35:29.587
When have you ever
asked me about my life?

35:38.179 --> 35:40.181
[violin music playing]

36:03.788 --> 36:05.790
Kunta: Massa!

36:05.873 --> 36:07.458
Massa!

36:07.542 --> 36:09.019
- [music stops]
- I think Ona's baby is coming!

36:09.043 --> 36:10.837
She's not seven months along.

36:10.920 --> 36:12.547
Just false pangs.
They'll pass.

36:12.630 --> 36:14.006
She fainted in the fields.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.050
Doctor,
you'd better come quick.

36:22.515 --> 36:24.892
Oh.

36:24.976 --> 36:27.728
[sighs]

36:27.812 --> 36:29.480
All right.

36:29.564 --> 36:31.399
There.
There we go.

36:32.650 --> 36:34.777
[laughs]

36:34.861 --> 36:37.029
Cut the cord.

36:37.113 --> 36:38.364
Okay.

36:38.447 --> 36:41.033
Come along. Come along.
Breathe.

36:41.117 --> 36:42.368
- Please, Lord.
- Breathe.

36:42.451 --> 36:44.328
- Please, Jesus.
- Breathe.

36:44.412 --> 36:46.622
- Oh, please, Jesus.
- Come on, little one.

36:46.706 --> 36:48.833
- [baby cries]
- Wait. Ah!

36:48.916 --> 36:50.668
- There we are.
- Oh!

36:50.751 --> 36:53.462
Oh. Oh.

36:53.546 --> 36:55.548
[crying continues]

36:57.133 --> 37:02.513
I told you explicitly not to put
pregnant hands in the field!

37:02.597 --> 37:05.266
She were only harvesting, sir.
She weren't swinging no ax.

37:05.349 --> 37:06.684
She is coming
out of your wages.

37:06.767 --> 37:08.352
Where's the wet nurse?

37:08.436 --> 37:10.271
Belle: [sobs]
She's in the cabin, Massa.

37:10.354 --> 37:12.064
- I'll take him to her.
- No, I'll do it.

37:12.148 --> 37:13.858
You and Toby bury his mother.

37:16.694 --> 37:19.780
We're calling
this little boy... Noah.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.368
Make a record of it, Spalding.

37:24.452 --> 37:25.703
Out of my way!

37:31.125 --> 37:35.463
Oh, thank you
for your peace, Jesus.

37:35.546 --> 37:37.757
Thank you for your peace, Lord.

37:40.843 --> 37:42.803
Get back to work!

37:42.887 --> 37:44.722
[sobs]

37:44.805 --> 37:47.642
Thank you
for your peace, Jesus.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.231
Thank you
for your rest, my Lord.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.609
Thank you for your rest, Lord.

38:05.117 --> 38:07.119
[singing in foreign language]

38:15.962 --> 38:17.755
[door opens]

38:23.761 --> 38:25.638
[singing continues]

38:31.686 --> 38:33.604
Belle,

38:33.688 --> 38:36.983
my Kintango teaches...

38:37.066 --> 38:39.360
Uh, my Kintango teaches me

38:39.443 --> 38:44.365
that a warrior
must make a family.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.909
And what I mean is, uh...

38:46.993 --> 38:49.286
Is...

38:49.370 --> 38:52.581
Every Mandinka warrior
must complete these tasks, eh?

38:52.665 --> 38:55.042
Like, uh... like riding,

38:55.126 --> 38:57.211
um, um, paddling, and the...

39:02.383 --> 39:06.971
Why don't you try and knock again
and maybe talk about something different?

39:07.054 --> 39:09.098
[tribal music playing]

39:18.566 --> 39:20.484
[door opens]

39:25.239 --> 39:28.200
[sighs] Belle...

39:28.284 --> 39:31.495
[soft music plays]

39:31.579 --> 39:35.624
When I arrived
in this country, America,

39:35.708 --> 39:38.544
I decided to close my heart.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.963
It was the only way
for me to stay strong...

39:41.047 --> 39:42.715
care for no one.

39:44.884 --> 39:48.888
Then, I remember
opening my eyes in great pain.

39:51.057 --> 39:52.641
And the first thing I saw
was you.

39:56.103 --> 39:57.730
Helping me.

39:59.148 --> 40:00.983
No, I didn't see you.

40:01.067 --> 40:03.611
I depended on you,
but I did not see you.

40:04.945 --> 40:09.408
It took too long, Belle, but now I see
a woman like no one I've ever met...

40:09.492 --> 40:13.079
kind and strong...

40:13.162 --> 40:15.414
and very beautiful

40:15.498 --> 40:16.999
and smart, and...

40:19.168 --> 40:22.254
I hope that...

40:22.338 --> 40:26.050
Well, I-I hope that...

40:26.133 --> 40:28.886
- What I would like...
- Yes...

40:28.969 --> 40:31.222
Kunta Kinte,

40:31.305 --> 40:34.433
I will be your wife.

40:40.106 --> 40:41.357
She will!

40:41.440 --> 40:44.652
- [laughing]
- Yes!

40:53.661 --> 40:56.539
Whatever happens, this matters.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.874
Our love matters.

41:02.461 --> 41:06.924
The Lord sure did limit
the amount of time we has together.

41:07.007 --> 41:11.053
But He didn't limit
how much we can love one another.

41:11.137 --> 41:13.556
With God as my witness,

41:13.639 --> 41:17.101
I say you man and wife.

41:17.184 --> 41:18.978
[both giggle]

41:19.061 --> 41:21.480
Even if he parts you tomorrow,

41:21.564 --> 41:23.816
your love, it will never die.

41:25.151 --> 41:26.986
[both chuckle]

41:27.069 --> 41:29.029
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, now. Hey, now. Hey, now.

41:29.113 --> 41:30.698
Calm down.

41:30.781 --> 41:32.700
We gon' make this official.

41:32.783 --> 41:34.493
There you go.

41:34.577 --> 41:36.787
How does a broom
make it official?

41:36.871 --> 41:40.124
Well, we jump it together,
just like in Africa.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.918
[laughs] Uh, no people
in Africa jump brooms.

41:43.002 --> 41:45.087
You don't know
every people in Africa.

41:45.171 --> 41:47.131
Every nigger
on every plantation say

41:47.214 --> 41:49.526
that jumpin' the broom when you get
married come from the old way.

41:49.550 --> 41:52.678
Old ways from Europe, must be.
Passed down from master to slave.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.638
Belle, they making fun of us.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.616
- Oh, no.
- Won't let us marry under their laws...

41:56.640 --> 42:00.394
to remind us we belong to them,
not each other.

42:00.519 --> 42:03.105
Boy, either you jump
over this broom,

42:03.189 --> 42:06.442
or Imma swat you
upside the head with it.

42:06.525 --> 42:10.821
See this?
Making this good woman wait!

42:10.905 --> 42:12.531
Look at her.

42:12.615 --> 42:15.743
Look at them eyes.
Look at that smile.

42:18.704 --> 42:23.209
Belle, if doing this
makes you happy,

42:23.292 --> 42:24.543
I'll jump with you.

42:24.627 --> 42:25.878
- [chuckles]
- High as I can.

42:25.961 --> 42:27.254
- You ready? Mm?

42:30.090 --> 42:31.258
Aah!

42:31.342 --> 42:32.885
[cheers and applause]

42:35.304 --> 42:36.555
It wasn't all that!

42:38.265 --> 42:39.934
[giggles]

42:40.017 --> 42:41.560
Woman: Congratulations!

42:44.021 --> 42:46.232
May God bless your womb, Belle.

42:48.442 --> 42:49.902
This suit you so well.

42:55.658 --> 42:57.576

Doctor's brother.

44:13.485 --> 44:17.156
Belle:
Oh, Lord, not now. Not today.

44:17.239 --> 44:19.050
Driver slave: I sure do hate
to cause consternation.

44:19.074 --> 44:21.535
Dr. Waller
needs to come quick.

44:21.660 --> 44:24.330
His brother's wife
is fixin' to have a baby.

44:27.207 --> 44:29.585
Bless you.

44:29.668 --> 44:32.171
Belle, continue.

44:32.254 --> 44:34.840
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

44:34.923 --> 44:36.759
[crowd murmuring]

44:36.842 --> 44:38.719
[music resumes]

44:42.473 --> 44:44.534
Oh, so you just wanted to dance with me.
Is that what it was?

44:44.558 --> 44:46.060
[laughs]

44:46.143 --> 44:48.562
You look beautiful.
Come on.

44:48.687 --> 44:51.523
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Fiddler.

44:55.611 --> 44:57.446

45:14.713 --> 45:16.608
William: Be sure to be ready
earlier tomorrow, Toby,

45:16.632 --> 45:19.676
and we'll come back and visit
with Mrs. Waller and the baby.

45:19.760 --> 45:21.637
Yes, Massa.

45:21.720 --> 45:23.639
You mind if I ask
what Miss Elizabeth had?

45:23.722 --> 45:26.183
Beautiful baby girl...
Melissa Kathryn.

45:26.266 --> 45:28.227
But we're going
to call her "Missy."

45:28.310 --> 45:32.356
- Truly, I've never been happier.
- Yes, Massa.

45:32.439 --> 45:34.691
I'm sure you love that child
as if she was your own, eh?

45:34.775 --> 45:35.776
[chuckles]

45:36.777 --> 45:39.488
Don't you dare insult my character
or my sister-in-law's virtue.

45:39.571 --> 45:40.823
Do you understand me?

45:40.906 --> 45:44.535
- You Black bastard.
- I'm sorry.

45:46.537 --> 45:48.257
That's not what I meant.
Uh, sometimes my...

45:48.330 --> 45:49.915
Oh, just drive!

45:54.128 --> 45:55.462
- [door slams]
- [sighs]

45:55.546 --> 45:57.005
I could have killed him.

45:57.089 --> 45:58.841
Hmm?
I should have killed him.

45:58.924 --> 46:01.260
He strike me on my wedding day!

46:01.343 --> 46:03.220
Shh!
It's over now.

46:03.303 --> 46:04.930
It's never gonna be over, Belle!

46:05.013 --> 46:07.349
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

46:07.433 --> 46:08.684
Listen to me!

46:09.768 --> 46:11.145
At least we're together.

46:15.941 --> 46:17.234
The three of us.

46:18.527 --> 46:20.279
Our family.

46:25.033 --> 46:26.994
There's something
I need to tell you.

46:28.662 --> 46:31.081
This won't be my first child.

46:31.165 --> 46:33.750
I had two sons
when I was just a girl,

46:33.834 --> 46:39.339
but my old Massa sold 'em both
and my husband, too.

46:39.423 --> 46:42.551
I never thought I'd be able
to have another child.

46:42.634 --> 46:47.389
If I was to lose
this one, I'm...

46:47.473 --> 46:49.725
I will protect our child.

46:52.144 --> 46:54.062
[sighs]

46:57.107 --> 46:58.942
He will be our warrior.

[man vocalizing]

47:28.222 --> 47:30.349
[baby cries]

47:40.234 --> 47:42.778
What you gonna name her?

47:42.861 --> 47:46.448
I guess...
[chuckles]

47:46.532 --> 47:49.117
"Fiddler" ain't the right name
for a little baby girl.

47:49.201 --> 47:50.494
Mm.

47:50.577 --> 47:53.163
You could call her
"Fiddleretta."

47:53.247 --> 47:56.583
I always thought I'd have a boy child,
a warrior.

47:59.253 --> 48:02.381
I was always too afraid
to have a family.

48:02.464 --> 48:08.345
But you got yourself a beautiful baby girl
and a beautiful wife.

48:08.428 --> 48:11.139
Yes. And Massa got us all.

48:11.223 --> 48:13.976
[baby cries]

48:14.059 --> 48:18.230
So, this here the...
the real Africa ways?

48:18.313 --> 48:22.276
Naming your child 'fore
the stars and all creation.

48:22.359 --> 48:23.819
No.

48:25.445 --> 48:27.197
The man usually names
the child alone.

48:27.281 --> 48:28.615
Mm-hmm.

48:28.699 --> 48:32.911
But I have my own way,
And I want you here with me.

48:34.496 --> 48:36.248
- Yeah?
- Yes.

48:38.667 --> 48:39.918
I'm here.

48:40.002 --> 48:42.045
And if you...

48:42.129 --> 48:44.673
if you play my mother's song,

48:44.756 --> 48:46.633
then she will be with me, too.

48:46.717 --> 48:49.261

a hoedown, are ya?

49:11.199 --> 49:12.760
- It's candle-lighting time.
- Yes, sir.

49:12.826 --> 49:14.828
Everybody in the state
of Virginia know

49:14.953 --> 49:16.747
a nigger can't be on the road
after sundown.

49:16.830 --> 49:19.166
- We're not in the road.
- Come again?

49:19.249 --> 49:21.752
We're not in the road.
This is Dr. Waller's property.

49:21.835 --> 49:23.086
Are you correcting me, boy?

49:23.170 --> 49:25.255
No, sir!
No, he ain't. He ain't.

49:25.339 --> 49:27.507
We... we... we on our way
to the farm proper.

Hold on, Uncle.

[horse neighs]

49:31.386 --> 49:34.765
- We got to gather us a nigger tax.
- I ain't got no money.

49:34.848 --> 49:37.392
How 'bout you just
hand over the tar baby?

49:37.476 --> 49:39.353
[baby cries]

49:45.275 --> 49:47.152
You gentlemen,
you got it all wrong.

49:47.235 --> 49:50.322
You got it all wrong.

49:50.405 --> 49:53.659
My name ain't "Uncle."

49:53.742 --> 49:55.077
My name ain't "boy."

49:58.413 --> 49:59.915
My name ain't "Fiddler."

50:05.170 --> 50:07.506
My name is Henry.

50:07.589 --> 50:09.508
[thunder rumbles]

50:09.591 --> 50:12.928
So y'all call me Henry.

50:15.222 --> 50:17.307
Just get on out of here.

50:17.391 --> 50:21.144

Go on 'fore you start causing trouble.

50:21.228 --> 50:22.479

- No! Give me my baby. No!

- No. Please don't take my child!

52:28.522 --> 52:30.607
and you hiding in the bushes,
babies cry.

52:30.690 --> 52:33.026
So we cannot run!

52:33.151 --> 52:34.629
I will never make peace
with this life,

52:34.653 --> 52:37.093
but I will not orphan a child again,
not when I have a choice.

52:37.155 --> 52:38.532
[crying]

52:38.615 --> 52:41.284
They killed Fiddler, Belle.

[baby cooing]

52:43.370 --> 52:46.164
He saved us.

52:46.248 --> 52:48.375

No, no, no, no.

- They killed him!

I'm sorry.

But you... ah...

[inhales deeply]

you are my family now.

...which means
"Stay put."

But not stay a slave!

Kizzy, you are the daughter
of Kunta Kinte,

54:02.824 --> 54:05.994

And though you will
never know them,

granddaughter of Omoro
and Binta Kinte.

Allahu Akbar!

[echoing] Behold!

54:22.552 --> 54:24.763
The only thing greater
than you.

54:34.898 --> 54:37.251
If you feel him slowing down,
just give him a little kick, now.

54:37.275 --> 54:40.111
It won't hurt him.
That's it.

54:41.112 --> 54:42.822
How 'bout now, Mama?

54:42.906 --> 54:46.159
Mm-mm. You got to mix the honey
till it blends in.

54:46.284 --> 54:47.869
One, two...

54:47.953 --> 54:50.914
- Count in your head!
- Yes, Mama.

54:54.751 --> 54:57.504
William: Yes.
Very good.

55:00.298 --> 55:02.759
How 'bout now, Mama?

55:04.094 --> 55:05.387
Let me see.

55:08.682 --> 55:11.768
Mm-hmm.
That's just fine.

55:11.851 --> 55:13.687
Now you can take some
to your papa.

55:15.563 --> 55:16.898
Be careful.

Good morning, Miss Missy.
How are you today?

55:43.216 --> 55:45.218
Kizzy, look what I brought you.

55:49.681 --> 55:53.351
I spilled punch on it,
so I asked Mama if I could give it to you.

55:53.435 --> 55:56.271
It's so pretty.
Thank you, Missy.

55:58.940 --> 55:59.941
Come on. Let's go play.

56:00.025 --> 56:01.359
But I'm helping Mama.

Missy: You don't mind,
do you, Auntie Belle?

56:03.820 --> 56:05.339
- Please?
- No, no, no. Belle doesn't mind.

56:05.363 --> 56:06.823
Do you, Belle?

56:06.906 --> 56:09.659
For a little while, hmm?

56:09.743 --> 56:12.078
- Good.
- Don't go far.

56:12.162 --> 56:15.373
- Yes, Mama.

[screams]

56:40.648 --> 56:42.568
Will you accept the body
and blood of our Savior?

56:42.609 --> 56:44.152
You have a soul, child!

56:44.235 --> 56:46.946
It belongs to God,
not your captor!

56:47.030 --> 56:48.656
Let her go!
She's mine!

56:48.740 --> 56:50.533
Jesus alone
can wash you of sin.

56:50.617 --> 56:52.327
Aah!

56:52.410 --> 56:55.413
Jesus alone!
Jesus!

56:57.999 --> 56:59.709
Where'd that old coot
come from?

56:59.793 --> 57:02.504
He was pickled for sure.

Preacher: Ye that fear God,
give audience.

57:19.354 --> 57:21.815
The darkness of the night
that you experience

57:21.898 --> 57:23.441
is deserved punishment

57:23.525 --> 57:28.863
for your disgraceful and iniquitous
practice of keeping African slaves.

57:28.947 --> 57:31.074
This base custom,

57:31.157 --> 57:34.369
so evidently contrary
to the laws of God,

57:34.452 --> 57:39.165
violates the natural and unalienable
rights of mankind.

57:39.249 --> 57:42.418
For all those
who prosper from slavery,

57:42.502 --> 57:45.880
hellfire will
be your ultimate reward.

57:45.964 --> 57:47.966
[congregation singing
indistinctly]

57:48.800 --> 57:52.220
Will the toubab go to Hell
because they own slaves?

57:52.303 --> 57:54.305
Because they own us?

57:54.389 --> 57:56.850
That'd be a lot of toubab in Hell.

57:56.933 --> 57:58.977
Don't you ever let me hear
you say that word again.

57:59.060 --> 58:00.687
But that's what
the preacher said.

58:00.770 --> 58:02.564
- You ain't a preacher.
- You mama is right.

58:02.647 --> 58:06.025
You're not a preacher,
'cause preachers are...

58:07.485 --> 58:09.571
- Hmm?
- [giggles]

58:11.698 --> 58:15.618
Besides, Hell is not punishment
enough for the toubab.

58:17.412 --> 58:19.289
How will the toubab
be punished?

58:19.372 --> 58:23.626
What did I just tell you?
God will take care of us.

58:23.710 --> 58:25.128
Now eat your food.

58:31.759 --> 58:34.470
Okay, that's good, that's good.
You don't want to make him fat.

58:34.554 --> 58:36.764
No, I want him to get fat, Fa.

58:36.848 --> 58:38.766
- Why?
- So he'll be happy.

58:38.850 --> 58:40.518
[laughs]

58:40.602 --> 58:42.562
But if he's fat,
he can't run, eh?

58:42.645 --> 58:44.564
And it's running
that makes him most happy.

58:44.647 --> 58:47.275
- Running makes him feel free, eh?
- [laughs]

58:47.358 --> 58:48.776
Hi, Uncle Toby!

58:48.860 --> 58:51.905
Kizzy, I brought you a bonnet!

58:51.988 --> 58:53.781
Toby, can we see how it fits?

58:53.865 --> 58:56.367
Auntie Belle said yes.
We'll just be right outside.

58:56.451 --> 58:59.704
Kunta: Wait!
Don't go far.

58:59.787 --> 59:02.081
- Hey, Kizzy!
- Hey, stupid.

59:09.547 --> 59:12.050
Oh, it's so pretty!
Thank you!

59:12.133 --> 59:14.552
Hold on.
Over here.

59:15.845 --> 59:18.139
- Goes with my dress.
- Sit down right here.

59:19.682 --> 59:22.101
[man shouts indistinctly
in distance]

59:27.482 --> 59:30.151
- I thought we could read together.
- Missy!

59:30.235 --> 59:32.362
I'm just learning,
but I can teach you what I know.

59:32.445 --> 59:35.406
But Mama said slaves have been whipped
and put in jail,

59:35.490 --> 59:38.243
- and even...
- So we just got to keep it a secret.

59:38.326 --> 59:41.537
- But...
- 'Cause you and me are friends.

59:41.621 --> 59:43.206
Ain't we?

59:45.083 --> 59:46.918
Yes.

59:47.001 --> 59:48.544
You and me are friends.

59:48.628 --> 59:50.546
For always.

59:50.630 --> 59:52.465
For always.

59:56.094 --> 59:57.929
- "A."
- "A."

59:58.012 --> 59:59.264
Like an apple.

59:59.347 --> 01:00:01.432
- "B."
- "B."

01:00:01.516 --> 01:00:02.809
Like, um, a bee.

01:00:02.892 --> 01:00:04.852
- "C."
- "C."

01:00:04.936 --> 01:00:06.396
Like a... a cat.

01:00:06.479 --> 01:00:08.356
- [coughs]
- [gasps] Father!

01:00:10.149 --> 01:00:12.443
Missy, what are you doing
out here all alone

01:00:12.527 --> 01:00:14.445
with a little nigger girl, huh?

01:00:14.529 --> 01:00:16.197
We were just playing, Papa.

01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:18.908
Yeah, well,
this one is devious.

01:00:18.992 --> 01:00:20.618
Just like her father.

01:00:20.702 --> 01:00:23.413
Anything you need,
Massa Waller?

01:00:23.496 --> 01:00:26.749
I can, uh, get Belle to cook you up
something real good.

01:00:29.836 --> 01:00:31.087
[breathing heavily]

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:32.839
[leather creaking]

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:38.011
You take me for a fool, boy?

01:00:38.094 --> 01:00:39.178
Hmm?

01:00:39.262 --> 01:00:40.888
Huh?

01:00:40.972 --> 01:00:43.725
No, Massa.

01:00:43.808 --> 01:00:47.854
This pickaninny of yours is trying
to beguile my innocent little girl.

01:00:47.937 --> 01:00:50.315
You think I'm gonna stand by
and let that happen,

01:00:50.398 --> 01:00:51.816
you have another thing coming.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.740
[stomps foot]
You understand me, boy?

01:00:58.823 --> 01:01:02.577
- Yes, Massa.
- Mm.

01:01:03.703 --> 01:01:05.580
All right.

01:01:07.999 --> 01:01:09.667
Missy: Abigail,
here's one for you,

01:01:09.751 --> 01:01:11.127
and one for you, Kizzy.

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.503
Thank you, Missy.

01:01:12.587 --> 01:01:13.921
You're welcome, Kizzy.

01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:19.260
[doll thuds]

01:01:24.474 --> 01:01:26.768
Here.
You can be the pickaninny.

01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:29.187
Why do you get to decide?

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.855
I'm white, and the Bible says

01:01:30.938 --> 01:01:34.275
white people are made
in the image of God.

01:01:34.359 --> 01:01:37.070
Missy:
This one's my favorite.

01:01:37.153 --> 01:01:39.447
Abigail: Good.
She can be my wife.

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.050
[deep voice]
Fetch me my dinner, woman.

01:01:41.074 --> 01:01:42.575
Get it yourself.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.952
A good wife obeys her husband.

01:01:45.036 --> 01:01:47.246
Sort of like a slave
has to obey her master?

01:01:49.290 --> 01:01:51.709
Guess us girls
ain't that different after all.

01:01:51.793 --> 01:01:53.503
Your nigger's stupid.

01:01:53.586 --> 01:01:55.296
Stop being so cross.

01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:59.300
Well, I hope that smart-mouth pickaninny
stabs you in your sleep.

01:01:59.384 --> 01:02:01.677
I'm fixin'
to stab you right now!

01:02:01.761 --> 01:02:03.096
[door slams]

01:02:03.179 --> 01:02:04.972
- Nigger lover!
- Devil!

01:02:05.056 --> 01:02:06.682
Kizzy: Missy, don't!

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.476
Emmeline:
Land sakes!

01:02:08.559 --> 01:02:11.813
Abigail, why are you all
screaming like savages?

01:02:11.896 --> 01:02:16.401
Missy and... me...

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:22.532
was just asking Kizzy to bring
us some refreshments.

01:02:22.615 --> 01:02:24.367
That's what you all
were screaming at?

01:02:24.450 --> 01:02:25.993
- [chuckles nervously]
- Well, Kizzy,

01:02:26.077 --> 01:02:27.596
go fetch some refreshments
for the girls.

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.289
Yes, ma'am.
'Scuse me, ladies.

01:02:32.166 --> 01:02:34.669
Careful with that, Kizzy.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.392
They want to have that
tonight for dinner?

01:02:36.462 --> 01:02:37.964
Woman: I believe so.

01:03:01.946 --> 01:03:03.865
Missy:
Happy birthday, Kizzy!

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:11.581
- Missy, it's beautiful!
- Ah!

01:03:11.664 --> 01:03:15.751
I was worried sick about orderin' it
without Mama asking pesky questions.

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:19.088
But then I realized
we have the same initials! Hmm?

01:03:19.172 --> 01:03:21.132
Melissa Kathryn Waller.

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.509
Miss Kizzy Waller.
[giggles]

01:03:23.593 --> 01:03:25.195
I'm such a ninny,
I didn't realize it before.

01:03:25.219 --> 01:03:26.888
I'll never
be able to thank you.

01:03:26.971 --> 01:03:29.640
Oh, no great shakes.
Now, listen,

01:03:29.724 --> 01:03:33.644
Mama keeps going on about shipping me
off to London for finishing school.

01:03:33.728 --> 01:03:36.689
And I know you don't believe in God,
but say a prayer anyway.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:38.524
Oh, yeah.

01:03:38.608 --> 01:03:41.402
Jesus sure have taken
care of us Negroes.

01:03:41.486 --> 01:03:43.905
Time's runnin' short.
What's your fancy?

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:47.450
You already know all the dreadful
Shakespeare dramas by heart, huh?

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:50.077
What's this monstrosity?

01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:54.207
"Doctor John Hunter's
Gross Anatomy."

01:03:54.290 --> 01:03:55.875
Mm.

01:03:57.835 --> 01:03:59.587
Oh, eww!

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.106
Is that really what it looks
like on the inside?

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.174
I will never, ever have a baby.

01:04:03.257 --> 01:04:05.468
- Oh, don't be hysterical.
- [giggles]

01:04:07.345 --> 01:04:10.598
How does it stand up like that?

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:13.351
I... I don't...
[chuckles]

01:04:13.434 --> 01:04:15.353
"Pubescent male peach fuzz

01:04:15.436 --> 01:04:20.066
corresponds with the accelerated growth
of the corpus spongiosum."

01:04:20.149 --> 01:04:23.861
Ugh, look at all that corpus...
and hair.

01:04:23.945 --> 01:04:27.281
Do you have any hair
down there? Hmm?

01:04:27.365 --> 01:04:29.367
[giggles]
Have you lost your senses?!

01:04:29.450 --> 01:04:31.911
Let me see!
It's my right.

01:04:31.994 --> 01:04:33.579
[knock on door, door opens]

01:04:33.663 --> 01:04:35.498
Noah: Kizzy, Miss Missy,
y'all in here?

01:04:35.581 --> 01:04:36.874
Yes.

01:04:39.210 --> 01:04:41.087
Well, what is it?

01:04:41.170 --> 01:04:42.922
Your governess is here
to fetch you home.

01:04:44.465 --> 01:04:45.841
Happy birthday, Kizzy.

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:47.677
Thank you, Noah.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.762
[clock ticking]

01:04:50.429 --> 01:04:51.847
Noah.

01:04:55.393 --> 01:04:58.271
Bless your heart.
[giggles]

01:04:58.354 --> 01:05:03.693
Perhaps it would help
if you ate some peaches.

01:05:03.776 --> 01:05:05.736
[laughs]

01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:19.667
Happy birthday, young lady!

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.670
My, how you've blossomed!
See you tomorrow!

01:05:22.753 --> 01:05:25.548
Oh, yes. That's right.
Happy birthday, Kizzy.

01:05:25.631 --> 01:05:28.593
- Thank you, Massa.
- Kizzy.

01:05:28.676 --> 01:05:30.511
Mother needs help
in the sick cabin.

01:05:30.595 --> 01:05:32.054
- Yes, Fa.
- Go. Go.

01:05:32.138 --> 01:05:34.015
We'll ride later,
when it is less... wet.

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:37.727
What... what... uh, what is she?
She's 15?

01:05:37.810 --> 01:05:39.478
Kunta: Yes, Massa.

01:05:39.562 --> 01:05:42.440
Well, I suppose it's about time
that I bred her...

01:05:42.523 --> 01:05:45.443
with Noah, here.
What do you think about that, Noah?

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.948
But, uh, Kizzy has not
reached womanhood.

01:05:51.032 --> 01:05:53.284
- Hasn't she by now?
- No, sir.

01:05:53.367 --> 01:05:55.411
Her mother knows for sure,
and that's what she says.

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:58.706
Well, it won't be long.
All in good time, Noah, eh?

01:05:58.789 --> 01:06:00.708
[whistling]

01:06:07.298 --> 01:06:10.301
If you ever touch her...

01:06:24.148 --> 01:06:26.150
[lever creaks]

01:06:35.159 --> 01:06:37.036
Come with me.

01:06:41.749 --> 01:06:43.668
[breathing heavily]

01:06:45.378 --> 01:06:46.921
Do what I do.

01:06:52.009 --> 01:06:53.260
Your turn.

01:06:55.054 --> 01:06:56.555
Go.

01:06:58.432 --> 01:06:59.892
- [grunts]
- [horse snorts]

01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:03.312
The horse is too tall
and I have a dress on.

01:07:03.396 --> 01:07:05.231
And how do you know
what you'll be wearing?

01:07:05.314 --> 01:07:06.635
You must be prepared
at all times.

01:07:06.691 --> 01:07:09.110
[grunting]

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:16.784
[sighs] Are you defeated?

01:07:17.868 --> 01:07:19.995
- Go!
- [sighs angrily]

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:22.665
- Faster.
- But it don't have a saddle on.

01:07:22.748 --> 01:07:23.999
It does not need a saddle.

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:26.669
He was born free.
So be free with him.

01:07:26.752 --> 01:07:29.130
- [smooching]
- Stop kissing and ride him!

01:07:31.882 --> 01:07:33.175
Hey, faster.

01:07:34.218 --> 01:07:36.429
[grunts]

01:07:36.512 --> 01:07:38.431
Do not allow yourself
to be defeated.

01:07:38.514 --> 01:07:40.516
They can put the chains
on your body.

01:07:40.599 --> 01:07:43.352
Never let them put
the chains on your mind.

01:07:43.436 --> 01:07:47.898
You are the daughter
of Belle Kinte and Kunta Kinte.

01:07:47.982 --> 01:07:50.025
Anything is possible.
Go! Eh.

01:07:50.109 --> 01:07:51.527
[groans]

01:07:51.610 --> 01:07:53.404

- [body thuds]
- [groans]

01:07:57.283 --> 01:07:59.618
You are more Belle's child
than mine.

01:08:01.787 --> 01:08:03.038
[bees buzzing]

01:08:03.122 --> 01:08:04.882
But what am I supposed
to knock it down with?

01:08:04.915 --> 01:08:08.419
Hey. Anything within reach,
hmm, is a weapon.

01:08:15.885 --> 01:08:18.345
[grunting]

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.057

01:08:50.586 --> 01:08:52.880
Oh!

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:54.756
- East.
- Sun comes up.

01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.216
- West.
- Sun goes down.

01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.676
- North.
- Freedom.

01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.053
- South.
- Death.

01:08:59.136 --> 01:09:00.595
Binta.

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:02.055
[grunts] Grandmother.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:03.390
- Omoro.
- Grandfather.

01:09:03.474 --> 01:09:04.809
- Belle.
- Mother.

01:09:04.892 --> 01:09:06.185
- Kunta.
- Fa.

01:09:06.268 --> 01:09:07.770
Eh?

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:09.939
[speaks native language]

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:12.066
Ah.
[clicks tongue]

01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:13.818
Let's go!

01:09:13.901 --> 01:09:15.569
- [straining]
- [exclaims]

01:09:15.653 --> 01:09:18.154
[horses whinny]

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.620
What are you doing with that?!

01:09:24.703 --> 01:09:26.162
This is yours?

01:09:26.247 --> 01:09:28.541
I-I came in
for some kindling.

01:09:28.624 --> 01:09:29.725
- I wasn't stealing.
- Get out.

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:31.544
- I ain't gon' tell nobody.
- Get out!

01:09:31.627 --> 01:09:32.670
Kizzy, I swear!

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:36.006
[blade thwacks]

01:09:36.090 --> 01:09:37.716
# Well, it's early in the mornin' #

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:39.301
# Mornin' #

01:09:39.385 --> 01:09:41.095
# Early when I rise #

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:42.846
# Lordy mama #

01:09:42.930 --> 01:09:45.140
# Well, it's early every mornin' #

01:09:45.224 --> 01:09:46.684
# Baby #

01:09:46.767 --> 01:09:48.853
# Baby, when I rise #

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:50.187
# Well-a well-a #

01:09:50.270 --> 01:09:52.231
Kizzy, it's been a while now.

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:54.274
And I ain't told nobody,
just like I said.

01:09:54.358 --> 01:09:56.443
And I won't.

01:09:56.527 --> 01:09:58.279
Will you please
teach me how to read?

01:09:58.362 --> 01:10:00.364
# Well,
it's early in the mornin' #

01:10:00.447 --> 01:10:01.782
# Baby #

01:10:01.866 --> 01:10:03.701
# Well-a, in a my right side #

01:10:03.784 --> 01:10:05.578
# Lordy baby #

01:10:05.661 --> 01:10:07.830
Either way, this is for you.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:09.874
# Lordy sugar #

01:10:09.957 --> 01:10:11.709
# R-in-a my right side #

01:10:11.792 --> 01:10:13.627
# Lordy baby #

01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:15.462
# R-in-a my right side #

01:10:15.546 --> 01:10:17.423
# Lordy sugar #

01:10:17.506 --> 01:10:19.633
# R-in-a my right side #

01:10:19.717 --> 01:10:21.260
# Well-ah #

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:23.304
# Well, it's early in the mornin' #

01:10:23.387 --> 01:10:24.638
# Baby #

01:10:24.722 --> 01:10:26.724
# When I rise #

01:10:26.807 --> 01:10:28.767
# When I rise #

01:10:28.851 --> 01:10:30.936
# Well,
it's early in the mornin' #

01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.271
# Baby #

01:10:32.354 --> 01:10:35.983
And you follow this creek
to the water wheel.

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:38.277
Then you make your way
across the field home.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.404
Return before the Massa
sees you.

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:41.739
- Okay.
- Fa.

01:10:41.822 --> 01:10:44.033
If we were in Juffure,
could I be a Mandinka warrior?

01:10:44.116 --> 01:10:46.493
[laughs] No.

01:10:46.577 --> 01:10:48.913
A woman cannot be a warrior
in Juffure.

01:10:50.164 --> 01:10:52.041
But they don't know
what I know about you.

01:10:52.124 --> 01:10:54.919
Now, Kizzy,

01:10:55.002 --> 01:10:57.922
this country will always
be dangerous for you, mm?

01:10:58.005 --> 01:11:00.257
Many Massas,
Massas' sons, overseers,

01:11:00.341 --> 01:11:03.135
rape slave women
and pay no price.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:07.723
Now, if you ever feel
you must kill a toubab,

01:11:07.806 --> 01:11:10.601
then do it without hesitation,

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:16.273
only if you are prepared to die yourself.
That is your choice to make.

01:11:16.357 --> 01:11:17.942
Do you understand?

01:11:18.025 --> 01:11:20.569
Yes.

01:11:20.653 --> 01:11:22.988
Good.

01:11:23.072 --> 01:11:25.699
Come.
Come.

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:35.209
Ready.

01:11:35.292 --> 01:11:36.752
Be careful.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:42.591
Yes.

01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:50.349
What if a-a patrol
finds her?

01:11:50.432 --> 01:11:52.226
My Kintango would make us
do far worse.

01:11:52.309 --> 01:11:55.646
I don't want to hear nothing
about no Africa! This is our only child!

01:11:55.729 --> 01:11:57.481
She has the spirit
of a warrior.

01:11:57.564 --> 01:12:00.025
- She is a child.
- Yes.

01:12:00.109 --> 01:12:02.319
And I can't protect her.

01:12:04.238 --> 01:12:05.572
Fa!

01:12:05.656 --> 01:12:09.743
It felt like the water was talkin' to me,
leading me home.

01:12:09.827 --> 01:12:11.870
Mm.

01:12:11.954 --> 01:12:15.040
When I became a warrior, mm,

01:12:15.124 --> 01:12:18.252
my mother gave me beads
just like these.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:21.338
[sighs]

01:12:27.177 --> 01:12:29.138
[sighs]

01:12:31.974 --> 01:12:34.369
The best one is about a slave
who convinces his Massa to free him.

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:37.938
H-How'd he do that?
I sure want to learn that trick.

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:39.398
By using logic,

01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:42.484
and arguing that no man
should ever deny another's liberty.

01:12:42.568 --> 01:12:44.278
I like that.

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:45.988
And I don't know
why Massa threw it out.

01:12:46.071 --> 01:12:48.323
It must've been an abolitionist
who wrote this.

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:51.118
All other toubab might
applaud the speaker's skill

01:12:51.201 --> 01:12:53.495
but vehemently reject
the conclusion.

01:12:55.497 --> 01:12:57.708
Wh... When I found this,
I told myself,

01:12:57.791 --> 01:13:01.420
"Before I die, Imma at least learn
how to read me a page."

01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:02.838
[scoffs] You ain't dead yet.

01:13:02.921 --> 01:13:04.173
[chuckles]

01:13:04.256 --> 01:13:05.883
I'll be happy to teach you.

01:13:05.966 --> 01:13:08.135
But you mustn't tell Fa.

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:11.096
Kizzy, come on.
Kunta the last person I would tell.

01:13:14.183 --> 01:13:16.560
I sure would love to kiss you.

01:13:16.643 --> 01:13:18.896
[door opens]

01:13:18.979 --> 01:13:20.230
[dramatic music plays]

01:13:20.314 --> 01:13:22.066
Fa, stop.
Nothing happened!

01:13:22.149 --> 01:13:23.442
- Go home now.
- No.

01:13:23.525 --> 01:13:26.445
- Do what I say, child!
- I told you the truth.

01:13:26.528 --> 01:13:28.739
If you don't believe my word,
then you don't respect me.

01:13:51.053 --> 01:13:52.513
The boy knows you can read?

01:13:54.431 --> 01:13:55.682
Does your mother know?

01:13:58.769 --> 01:14:02.272
Do you have any idea
how you could end up? Hmm?

01:14:02.356 --> 01:14:04.983
In jail.
Or worse.

01:14:05.067 --> 01:14:07.611
- You can't frighten me.
- You frighten me!

01:14:07.694 --> 01:14:09.464
Do you know what they want
to do to you out there?

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:12.908
Reading is my way
of being a warrior...

01:14:12.991 --> 01:14:15.994
of being free inside.

01:14:16.078 --> 01:14:17.788
[somber music plays]

01:14:17.871 --> 01:14:21.125
And it's worth jail to me
or whatever comes.

01:14:32.010 --> 01:14:34.721
[indistinct shouting in distance]

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:56.451
You clumsy devil.

01:14:56.535 --> 01:14:58.579
Be more careful next time.

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:04.251
Yes.

01:15:04.334 --> 01:15:05.586
What did you say?

01:15:06.879 --> 01:15:10.132
- Yes, Massa.
- A nigger named Noah.

01:15:10.215 --> 01:15:12.676
I ain't never knew the doctor
to be a man of humor

01:15:12.759 --> 01:15:14.094
before he gave you that name.

01:15:16.763 --> 01:15:18.682
I wonder what my mama
would've named me.

01:15:18.765 --> 01:15:20.309
What's that, now?

01:15:20.392 --> 01:15:22.519
Said I wonder what my mama
would've named me...

01:15:22.603 --> 01:15:24.479
had she not died
the way she done.

01:15:24.563 --> 01:15:27.357
You wonder about your mama?
I wonder about your...

01:15:27.441 --> 01:15:28.817
Kunta: Noah!

01:15:28.901 --> 01:15:31.862
Massa wants that new Arabian broke
for the next subscription race, hmm?

01:15:31.945 --> 01:15:34.615
Just remember one thing...

01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:38.744
you may work for the African,
but you answer to me.

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:52.841
I ain't a murderer.

01:15:52.925 --> 01:15:55.093
One day, they gon'
turn me into one.

01:15:55.177 --> 01:15:58.805
They treat you like an animal
till you strike like one, hmm?

01:15:58.889 --> 01:16:00.224
Then they kill you like one.

01:16:00.307 --> 01:16:02.809
Not if you get away.

01:16:10.359 --> 01:16:12.819
[thunder rumbles]

01:16:12.903 --> 01:16:14.196
Kizzy: Florida's not
a state yet,

01:16:14.279 --> 01:16:16.823
so any Negro there
is somewhat free.

01:16:19.159 --> 01:16:21.536
- Florida, then.
- But it's so far away.

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.581
Yeah, it's far, it's hard to get to.

01:16:24.665 --> 01:16:26.226
And it's even harder to be found
once you're there.

01:16:26.250 --> 01:16:27.970
There's plenty
of free Blacks in New York...

01:16:28.001 --> 01:16:30.295
although they live in fear
of being abducted.

01:16:30.379 --> 01:16:32.339
- They can't abduct us all.
- Maybe.

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:34.716
But you won't have
manumission papers.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.427
Still, spring is hiring season
at the docks.

01:16:37.511 --> 01:16:38.762
If you made it up there,

01:16:38.845 --> 01:16:41.556
I'm sure you could find shelter
with an abolitionist society...

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.433
stow away on a ship
bound for Canada.

01:16:43.517 --> 01:16:45.602
And the second that ship docked,
you would be free.

01:16:45.686 --> 01:16:47.604
[thunder rumbles]

01:16:47.688 --> 01:16:49.731
- [door slams in distance]
- [horse neighs]

01:16:49.815 --> 01:16:51.942
- Hey!
- Noah, duck!

01:16:52.025 --> 01:16:53.986
Fa!

01:16:54.069 --> 01:16:55.612
Are you okay?

01:16:55.696 --> 01:16:57.281
Yeah.
Some of the roofing hit me.

01:16:57.364 --> 01:16:58.991
[grunting]

01:16:59.074 --> 01:17:00.742
Eh, I'm fine.

01:17:00.826 --> 01:17:02.703
We've got to get
to the big house. Go!

01:17:07.457 --> 01:17:10.460
Kizzy! Come!

01:17:10.544 --> 01:17:12.045
- Belle!
- Mama!

01:17:12.129 --> 01:17:13.672
- Belle!
- Mama!

01:17:13.755 --> 01:17:15.632
[screams]

01:17:17.843 --> 01:17:19.886
Where'd this weather
come from?!

01:17:19.970 --> 01:17:21.346
It's gonna stay a while!

01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:23.348
Oh, Lord!
What happened?!

01:17:23.432 --> 01:17:26.101
Hurry, Fa!
Hurry!

01:17:26.184 --> 01:17:28.145
You think it's a hurricane,
Uncle Toby?

01:17:29.271 --> 01:17:31.023
- Hey, hey!
- [screams]

01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:37.446
William: Missy?
Are you all right?

01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:39.531
John: What in God's name
is going on?

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:41.408
Toby, what happened
to your shoulder?

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.970
Spalding: Board the window before
the debris starts blowing in the house!

01:17:43.994 --> 01:17:45.162
Be safer in the cellar!

01:17:45.245 --> 01:17:46.889
Elizabeth: Yes, by all means,
we must make it to the cellar.

01:17:46.913 --> 01:17:49.416
John: Now, now.
Let's not all play the lady.

01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:51.209
This is not a hurricane.

01:17:51.293 --> 01:17:54.963
You see?
Come and gone just as fast.

01:17:55.047 --> 01:17:57.591
All right, it's no holiday.
Get back to work!

01:17:57.674 --> 01:17:59.217
I'll never get used
to this weather!

01:17:59.301 --> 01:18:02.637
Massa, this storm ain't done.

01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:07.642
Well, it appears to be.
Missy, come back to the house.

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:09.770
- Come on in, Kizzy.
- Come on.

01:18:09.853 --> 01:18:12.022
Fa!

01:18:12.105 --> 01:18:13.357
Belle: Kizzy!

01:18:17.819 --> 01:18:20.197
[thunder claps]

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.699
[weather vane creaking]

01:18:24.201 --> 01:18:27.537
- You come back here!
- Noah!

01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:28.955
Noah! Noah!

01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:30.415
Kizzy, is everything all right?

01:18:30.499 --> 01:18:32.501
[sighs]
You've got to go right now.

01:18:32.584 --> 01:18:33.978
- Right this second.
- What do you mean?

01:18:34.002 --> 01:18:35.629
No militia's gonna be out
in the storm.

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:37.033
The dogs can't pick up
your scent.

01:18:37.047 --> 01:18:38.548
You may get a full day,
if not two.

01:18:38.632 --> 01:18:40.050
You should go.
Now.

01:18:40.133 --> 01:18:41.635
Kizzy, come with me.

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:44.054
[gasps, sighs]

01:18:44.137 --> 01:18:46.890
Kizzy, we can make a real life
together in Canada.

01:18:46.973 --> 01:18:48.642
I'll find work.

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.352
They got plenty
of horses up there.

01:18:50.435 --> 01:18:54.106
And you... you could go to school.
Maybe even one day teach.

01:18:55.857 --> 01:18:58.110
We'll earn enough money
to buy back your folks.

01:18:58.193 --> 01:19:00.237
Kizzy, please say yes.

01:19:01.988 --> 01:19:03.323
[thunder claps]

01:19:03.407 --> 01:19:05.117
[wind howling]

01:19:08.829 --> 01:19:11.706
Lord, I wish you'd been wrong
about this storm!

01:19:11.790 --> 01:19:14.126
Please go inside
and rest that shoulder!

01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:15.252
[weather vane creaking]

01:19:15.335 --> 01:19:17.879
- He's going to run.
- What? Where's Kizzy?!

01:19:17.963 --> 01:19:19.381
Go in and batten
the sick house!

01:19:19.464 --> 01:19:22.509
If it loses a solitary shingle,
it'll be your hide!

01:19:22.592 --> 01:19:24.010
I can take her
to the cellar, sir.

01:19:24.094 --> 01:19:26.012
No, we're all going
to the cellar.

01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:29.599
Kizzy!

01:19:29.683 --> 01:19:32.394
Kizzy!

01:19:32.477 --> 01:19:34.604
Missy: Where's Kizzy?!
Where'd Kizzy go?!

01:19:34.688 --> 01:19:36.690
John: Move!
Stop lollygagging about!

01:19:36.773 --> 01:19:38.150
Where's Kizzy?!

01:19:38.233 --> 01:19:40.944
No! Kizzy!
[screams]

01:19:41.027 --> 01:19:42.779
Kizzy!

01:19:42.863 --> 01:19:44.239
- Don't!
- Kizzy!

01:19:44.322 --> 01:19:46.032
What are you doing?!

01:19:46.116 --> 01:19:48.285
Have you gone deaf,
girl? Go! Go!

01:19:48.368 --> 01:19:50.871
- Mama, Kizzy's still out here!
- Get into that cellar!

01:19:50.954 --> 01:19:53.373
- In!
- She needs to be in the cellar with us!

01:19:53.457 --> 01:19:55.083
Get into the cellar, girl!

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:56.835
- She is our family!
- Inside!

01:19:56.918 --> 01:19:58.253
She needs
to be with her family!

01:19:58.336 --> 01:20:00.213
- We are her family!
- Close it, Toby!

01:20:00.297 --> 01:20:02.007
And don't stay out there!

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:03.800
[breathing heavily]

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:08.221
- Come on!
- I can't find Kizzy!

01:20:08.305 --> 01:20:10.140
- This way!
- I can't find her!

01:20:10.223 --> 01:20:11.308
[shouts]

01:20:11.391 --> 01:20:12.517
[thunder claps]

01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:14.811
- Come on!
- [sobbing]

01:20:22.944 --> 01:20:26.323
Where'd our baby go?!
Where did our baby go?!

01:20:26.406 --> 01:20:28.533
- Mama!
- Kizzy!

01:20:28.617 --> 01:20:30.535
Here!

01:20:30.619 --> 01:20:32.579
Kizzy!

01:20:32.662 --> 01:20:35.957
[sobbing] Oh, my God!

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:39.252
Where did our baby go?!

01:20:39.336 --> 01:20:41.171
[sobbing continues]

01:20:41.254 --> 01:20:44.090

01:20:48.845 --> 01:20:49.846
[singing in distance]

01:20:49.930 --> 01:20:51.431
- Throw him in a hole.
- Yes.

01:20:51.515 --> 01:20:53.391
Man: Move on!

01:20:53.475 --> 01:20:55.477
- # Roll down #
- Belle: Kizzy!

01:20:55.560 --> 01:20:57.687
# Roll down #

Kizzy: Fa?

01:21:07.447 --> 01:21:10.075

[grunts] Kizzy!

01:21:27.300 --> 01:21:29.094
She just sits there cryin'.

01:21:29.177 --> 01:21:31.054
- Can't get a word out of her.
- [sniffles]

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:32.889
I just hope the boy makes it.

01:21:32.973 --> 01:21:34.933
[dogs barking]

01:21:35.016 --> 01:21:37.102
[indistinct shouting]

01:21:37.185 --> 01:21:39.604
- [horse neighs]
- Go back to the cabin.

01:21:39.688 --> 01:21:42.482
Spalding: Toby.
Get the wagon. Now!

01:21:44.109 --> 01:21:46.111
[horses neigh]

01:21:51.366 --> 01:21:54.286
- [sobs]
- Shh. Shh.

01:21:54.369 --> 01:21:56.371
[dogs barking, baying]

01:21:57.664 --> 01:21:58.915

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:03.003
Spalding:
Come on out now!

01:22:06.715 --> 01:22:08.425
Just bring him alive.

01:22:08.508 --> 01:22:11.219
Of course, sir.
No time at all.

01:22:11.303 --> 01:22:12.554
Noah!

01:22:12.637 --> 01:22:15.557
[dogs barking]

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.475
[chain clinks]

01:22:17.559 --> 01:22:19.978
You got to come out, boy.

01:22:23.273 --> 01:22:25.525
[chains clink]

01:22:25.609 --> 01:22:28.570
I got to bring you home.

01:22:28.653 --> 01:22:29.946
Noah.

01:22:37.871 --> 01:22:39.873
[screams]

01:22:44.544 --> 01:22:45.795
Noah, no!

01:23:12.238 --> 01:23:14.240
[man vocalizing]

01:23:34.552 --> 01:23:36.763
Doctor wants to see you.

01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:38.765
[crying]

01:23:40.684 --> 01:23:43.144
No. All of you.

01:23:45.230 --> 01:23:47.440
Kizzy, you're to wear
your best dress from Missy.

01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:56.574
[sobs]

01:23:57.867 --> 01:23:59.953
No, no, no, sir.
It is not my fault.

01:24:00.036 --> 01:24:03.039
You leave her unsupervised
with the nigger girl.

01:24:03.123 --> 01:24:04.916
She used your house
as her schoolroom.

01:24:05.041 --> 01:24:06.852
And now, in addition to all the
storm damage I have suffered,

01:24:06.876 --> 01:24:09.146
- I've lost a valuable slave, my Noah.
- And you shall be compensated.

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:10.171
- Compensated?
- Yes, sir.

01:24:10.255 --> 01:24:11.565
Brother, you are a man of debt,
not assets!

01:24:11.589 --> 01:24:12.966
- Doctor.
- Belle.

01:24:13.049 --> 01:24:14.467
[William sighs]

01:24:16.553 --> 01:24:18.473
Now, you've worked for me
for a long time, Belle,

01:24:18.555 --> 01:24:20.473
since I was a young man,
and I can honestly say

01:24:20.557 --> 01:24:23.101
- this is a day I hoped would never come.
- What day, Massa?

01:24:23.184 --> 01:24:25.812
I've just received this road pass,
forged by Kizzy to Noah,

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:27.147
so that he could escape.

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:28.481
- No.
- Yes!

01:24:28.565 --> 01:24:30.406
- No, no, that can't be true.
- Yes, it appears

01:24:30.442 --> 01:24:32.420
that somebody's been teaching her
to read and write!

01:24:32.444 --> 01:24:34.446
What are you waiting for?
Come along, gentlemen.

01:24:34.529 --> 01:24:35.965
- Do not tarry. Take this girl away!
- Missy!

01:24:35.989 --> 01:24:37.073
I'm very sorry, Belle.

01:24:37.157 --> 01:24:38.575
- Missy!
- No.

01:24:38.658 --> 01:24:39.969
- No, I'm very sorry, Belle.
- No. No. No.

01:24:39.993 --> 01:24:41.119
No! Missy!

01:24:41.202 --> 01:24:43.246
- No! No, Massa!
- Missy!

01:24:43.329 --> 01:24:45.081
- Get back!
- Missy, you've got to help me!

01:24:45.165 --> 01:24:46.350
- Please! Please, Massa.
- You've got to help me!

01:24:46.374 --> 01:24:48.102
Please, Massa, don't take the only child
I got left, Massa, please!

01:24:48.126 --> 01:24:50.396
Help you?! How could you do this to me?!
After all these years,

01:24:50.420 --> 01:24:53.339
- after everything that I've done for you!
- Missy.

01:24:53.423 --> 01:24:55.175
And I was gonna ask Mama
to buy you.

01:24:55.258 --> 01:24:56.694
- We could have stayed together forever.
- Massa, please.

01:24:56.718 --> 01:24:58.195
- Please!
- I would have kept you safe.

01:24:58.219 --> 01:25:00.054
How could you do this?!

01:25:00.138 --> 01:25:02.018
- [door opens]
- You brought this upon yourself.

01:25:02.098 --> 01:25:03.451
- Off with her.
- And upon your poor family.

01:25:03.475 --> 01:25:05.435
- [door closes]
- No! You brought it on my family!

01:25:05.518 --> 01:25:06.519
William:
Take her away.

01:25:06.603 --> 01:25:08.414
- You brought it on my family!
- Oh, take her away!

01:25:08.438 --> 01:25:09.731
- Massa!
- What a mess.

01:25:09.814 --> 01:25:11.316
I beg you, please,
Massa... wait! No!

01:25:11.399 --> 01:25:13.151
Please! Please, listen to me,
Massa, please!

01:25:13.234 --> 01:25:15.320
- I beg you, don't do this, please!
- Get off of me.

01:25:15.403 --> 01:25:17.113
I promise, Massa, please,
don't do that!

01:25:17.197 --> 01:25:19.073
- Please! Please!
- Don't you touch me!

01:25:19.157 --> 01:25:20.408
Kizzy!

01:25:20.492 --> 01:25:21.677
- What a mess!
- [Kizzy screams]

01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:23.453
Oh! What a mess.

01:25:23.536 --> 01:25:25.955
I know Missy is your child.
Hmm?

01:25:26.039 --> 01:25:29.334
Now you stop this or I will
tell your brother the truth.

01:25:29.417 --> 01:25:32.587
Oh, go on. Tell him about his wife,
me and his wife.

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.173
Slander his wife to his face,
and we'll see how quick he is

01:25:35.256 --> 01:25:37.717
to wrap a rope around your neck
and hoist you into a tree!

01:25:37.801 --> 01:25:40.887
Did you really think
a nigger could accuse me,

01:25:40.970 --> 01:25:42.250
a white man, of anything at all?

01:25:42.305 --> 01:25:44.057
Oh, get out of here,
you wretch.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.391
Go, go. Go.

01:25:45.475 --> 01:25:47.227
[Belle and Kizzy screaming]

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:49.187
- Kizzy! Kizzy!
- Easy, Belle.

01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:51.314
Kizzy!
No! No, no!

01:25:51.397 --> 01:25:53.983

Hello.

01:29:32.035 --> 01:29:33.453

You hidin'?

I ain't gonna hurt you.
Whoa, nelly!

01:29:47.008 --> 01:29:50.845
Now, this ain't the house
that Jack built.

01:29:52.638 --> 01:29:55.641
Though you sure do look like
a maiden all forlorn.

01:30:02.482 --> 01:30:05.109
Bet you never heard
that nursery rhyme, huh?

01:30:07.570 --> 01:30:11.199
This is the man,
all tattered and torn,

01:30:11.282 --> 01:30:14.994
who kissed the maiden
all forlorn.

01:30:28.674 --> 01:30:29.926
No!

01:30:30.009 --> 01:30:32.595
Now, you gonna behave,
or do I have to get a whip?

01:30:32.678 --> 01:30:34.847
- Kill me!
- Kill you?

01:30:34.931 --> 01:30:37.141
I just spent $600 on you, girl.

01:30:37.225 --> 01:30:39.536
You know how long and hard
I have to work to earn that money?

01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:41.687
And this is my right.

01:30:41.771 --> 01:30:43.189

I heard her howling
all the way up at the house.

01:31:53.718 --> 01:31:55.636
I'm gonna name you
after my daddy.

01:31:58.014 --> 01:32:00.141
What you think about that?

Kizzy, you feed him well, now.

01:32:18.826 --> 01:32:22.121

a mighty big appetite.

01:33:11.128 --> 01:33:13.214
- This is my right!
- Kill me!

01:33:13.297 --> 01:33:14.566
William: You brought this
upon yourself...

01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:15.734
- Help me!
- ...and your poor family.

01:33:15.758 --> 01:33:18.094
- Kizzy!
- No!

01:33:18.177 --> 01:33:19.845
Please! Help me!

01:33:19.929 --> 01:33:21.657
- Help me!
- Kunta: Your name is your spirit.

01:33:21.681 --> 01:33:23.474
- Your name is your shield.
- I'm sorry.

01:33:23.599 --> 01:33:25.518
I will name you Kizzy.

01:33:25.601 --> 01:33:28.104
- I'm sorry.
- Granddaughter...

01:33:28.187 --> 01:33:29.814
- Binta
- ...of Omoro...

01:33:29.897 --> 01:33:30.958
- Grandmother.
- ...and Binta Kinte.

01:33:30.982 --> 01:33:32.817
- Omoro.
- Grandfather.

01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:35.278
[baby cries]

01:33:35.361 --> 01:33:36.362
[Kizzy sobbing]

01:33:36.445 --> 01:33:37.947
Belle: Kizzy!

01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:39.824
Kizzy, no!
Please don't take my baby!

01:33:39.907 --> 01:33:41.492
- Please!
- Kunta: I can't protect her.

01:33:41.617 --> 01:33:43.369
[shushing]

01:33:43.452 --> 01:33:45.496
Noah:
Kizzy, please say yes.

01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:49.500
I love you.
I've always loved you.

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:51.085
I ain't never been free.

01:33:51.168 --> 01:33:53.254
They ain't ever
gon' tear me down.

01:33:53.337 --> 01:33:55.006
- You got to live.
- I'm sorry.

01:33:55.089 --> 01:33:57.133
Kunta: They can put the chains
on your body.

01:33:57.216 --> 01:33:58.860
Never let them put
the chains on your mind.

01:33:58.884 --> 01:34:02.805
Kintango: First duty of a Mandinka warrior
is to raise a family.

01:34:02.888 --> 01:34:05.349
Omoro: You must always honor
your ancestors.

01:34:05.433 --> 01:34:07.852
The ones who love you
and watch out for you.

01:34:07.935 --> 01:34:11.564
I don't know if this
is the right kind of place.

01:34:11.647 --> 01:34:13.524
[George cries]

01:34:13.649 --> 01:34:16.277
I don't even know
all of the story...

01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:19.196
there wasn't enough time.

01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:22.033
But I've got to tell you
about our people.

01:34:22.116 --> 01:34:24.452
My father is Kunta Kinte.

01:34:24.535 --> 01:34:26.662
He's a Mandinka warrior.

01:34:26.746 --> 01:34:30.124
You've got to know who he is
so you can know who you are.

01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:34.628
Look up, little one.

01:34:34.712 --> 01:34:37.882
See the stars, the moon,
the whole sky.

01:34:39.508 --> 01:34:42.928
Behold, the only thing
that is greater than you.

01:34:43.012 --> 01:34:44.805
[thunder rumbling]

01:34:59.070 --> 01:35:00.696
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:02.490
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #
# Ah #

01:35:02.573 --> 01:35:05.493
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:35:05.576 --> 01:35:07.495
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:35:07.578 --> 01:35:09.497
# Oh, oh, oh, oh #
# Ah #

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:12.500
# Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh #

01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:14.293
# Had a heart full of hope #

01:35:14.377 --> 01:35:15.836
# I swallowed my pride #

01:35:15.920 --> 01:35:19.256
# Seeing everything
I had go away #

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:21.258
# Praying for delivery now #

01:35:21.342 --> 01:35:23.219
# Peace on my mind #

01:35:23.302 --> 01:35:26.180
# Now let your grace rain on me #

01:35:27.181 --> 01:35:28.891
# What happened to my freedom? #

01:35:28.974 --> 01:35:30.267
# Separated my family #

01:35:30.351 --> 01:35:34.230
# Bringing to me this foreign place #

01:35:34.313 --> 01:35:36.232
# Now my hope is for surviving #

01:35:36.315 --> 01:35:37.858
# In the midst of evil #

01:35:37.942 --> 01:35:40.319
# Things are never gonna be the same #

01:35:40.403 --> 01:35:43.197
# I wasn't born this way #

01:35:43.280 --> 01:35:46.367
# No, I wasn't born this way #

01:35:46.450 --> 01:35:49.370
# No, I wasn't born in vain #

01:35:49.453 --> 01:35:52.373
# Oh no #

01:35:52.456 --> 01:35:54.333
# Oh no #

01:35:54.417 --> 01:35:58.754
# Why do I feel so much shame? #
