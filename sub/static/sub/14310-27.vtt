Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.099 --> 00:12.060
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.080 --> 00:15.019
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.039 --> 00:16.230
They were good.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.140
[theme music]

00:22.120 --> 00:26.129
Then there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.149 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.050
Oh, I hate Smurfs.

00:31.140 --> 00:33.219
I'll get you,
I'll get all of you

00:34.000 --> 00:36.119
if it's
the last thing I ever do!

00:38.159 --> 00:39.140
Unh!

00:39.159 --> 00:41.090
Oh, I'll get you.

00:41.109 --> 00:44.130
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:44.149 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest
is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.060
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.079 --> 00:53.229
And if you are good,
you may just

00:54.009 --> 00:57.000
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.159
The annual Smurf picnic.

01:24.219 --> 01:27.099
Oh, smurf, it's raining.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.189
I hate rain.

01:28.210 --> 01:31.230
Every time I wash
my wagon, it rains.

Oh, and all my laundry
is getting wet.

01:35.140 --> 01:38.109
Uh, don't worry, Smurfette.
I'll help you.

01:45.129 --> 01:48.189
Isn't that the smurfiest thing
you ever..

01:48.210 --> 01:51.060
Gosh, it's coming down
in buckets now.

01:51.079 --> 01:52.129
It's always the same.

01:52.150 --> 01:54.189
Every Smurf complains
about the weather

01:54.210 --> 01:57.159
but there's nothing
we can do to change it.

a weather-smurfing machine?

This'll be

the weather.

02:10.030 --> 02:12.000
Hey, Handy,
where are you going?

02:12.020 --> 02:15.009
To the old mill,

to the picnic, Poet Smurf?

03:45.020 --> 03:48.069
No, no.
I'm going to stay behind

to be safe than sorry.

Now behave your smurfs
and let's get moving.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.049
Oh, I'm so hot.

11:13.070 --> 11:17.019
[stammers]
Now I'm so cold.

11:17.039 --> 11:19.019
Now I'm so..
[thunder rumbles]

11:19.039 --> 11:20.100
...scared!

11:22.120 --> 11:26.059
(Handy)
My poor machine.
It's even worse than I feared.

11:26.080 --> 11:27.179
Quickly. We must reach it

11:27.200 --> 11:30.059
before the weather
changes again.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.120
[bell dings]

11:31.139 --> 11:34.039
- Yeow!
- Help!

11:34.059 --> 11:35.159
Hang on, Smurfs.

11:35.179 --> 11:38.039
We're nearly there.

11:38.059 --> 11:40.220
(Papa Smurf)
Pull, Handy. Turn it off.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.110
[grunts]
It's no use, Papa Smurf.

11:43.129 --> 11:45.059
The controls are jammed.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.129
Oh, I knew it. We're doomed.

11:47.149 --> 11:50.159
- Finished.
- I can use this.

11:50.179 --> 11:54.080
Hey, my umbrella.
What are you doing to it?

11:56.009 --> 11:59.009
Aha! A smurfy idea, Handy.

11:59.029 --> 12:01.139
Stand back. Everyone back.

12:02.129 --> 12:04.100
[machine whirring]

12:07.210 --> 12:08.210
[thunder rumbles]

12:08.230 --> 12:11.019
[electricity crackling]

12:14.009 --> 12:15.070
[explosion]

12:16.080 --> 12:17.139
[all cheering]

12:17.159 --> 12:20.220
So long, old
weather-smurfing machine.

12:21.000 --> 12:23.139
I know how hard it was
for you to destroy

12:23.159 --> 12:25.059
your greatest invention, Handy.

12:25.080 --> 12:28.159
But from now on, we must
never tamper with nature

12:28.179 --> 12:31.220
without first considering
the consequences.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.070
(all)
Yes, Papa Smurf.

12:34.090 --> 12:37.159
Ooh, happy days are here again.

12:37.179 --> 12:41.000
Yeah. That sun sure feels good.

12:41.019 --> 12:43.220
Oh, yeah?
How am I supposed to finish

12:44.000 --> 12:46.179
my new "Ode To The Rain?"

12:46.200 --> 12:47.210
[gasps]

12:47.230 --> 12:49.070
That better?

12:49.090 --> 12:50.179
[all laughing]

12:52.049 --> 12:55.090
Well, at least
it's ecologically sound.

12:55.110 --> 12:56.169
Hmph!

12:57.230 --> 12:59.210
[theme music]
