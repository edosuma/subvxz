WEBVTT

00:13.311 --> 00:16.081
2 million fake bank accounts

00:16.116 --> 00:19.051
under customers' names
without their knowledge.

00:19.086 --> 00:20.613
At one time I had,
looking at it,

00:20.648 --> 00:23.187
counting it,
I had 15 accounts at once.

00:23.222 --> 00:24.716
The guy that was doing
the camera work today

00:24.751 --> 00:27.257
where I am at the Capitol
was one of those customers

00:27.292 --> 00:29.787
that got an unauthorized,
unwarranted account.

00:29.822 --> 00:31.558
We hear it all over the place.

00:31.593 --> 00:34.198
Now, thousands of employees
have been fired,

00:34.233 --> 00:35.793
and customers are left wondering

00:35.828 --> 00:37.630
if they're victims.

00:37.665 --> 00:39.797
The unauthorized opening
of accounts in your name

00:39.832 --> 00:41.799
may be by using fraudulent
email addresses or pins

00:41.834 --> 00:43.801
is just shocking conduct,
and absolutely

00:43.836 --> 00:45.407
should not be tolerated.

00:45.442 --> 00:47.079
I don't even know
when it's gonna get going.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.411
Well, there's 10,
there's 15, there's 5,

00:49.446 --> 00:51.809
and I didn't authorize
any of this.

00:51.844 --> 00:53.712
Ma'am, I'm so sorry,
we're short staffed

00:53.747 --> 00:55.747
-on Saturdays.
-I need my check

00:55.782 --> 00:57.683
deposited by today.

00:57.718 --> 01:01.126
If I could just maybe get
a deposit slip really quickly.

01:01.161 --> 01:02.424
So, you haven't resigned,

01:02.459 --> 01:03.821
you haven't returned
a single nickel

01:03.856 --> 01:06.527
of your personal earnings,
you haven't fired

01:06.562 --> 01:08.496
a single senior executive.

01:08.531 --> 01:09.794
Yeah, I can take care
of that for you.

01:09.829 --> 01:13.204
It will be much quicker
if you come inside.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.305
-Thank you.
-Instead, evidently

01:15.340 --> 01:17.439
your definition of "accountable"

01:17.474 --> 01:20.343
is to push the blame
to your low-level employees

01:20.378 --> 01:22.708
who don't have the money
for a fancy PR firm

01:22.743 --> 01:24.809
to defend themselves.

01:31.818 --> 01:33.653
So, if I get me
one of them new smartphones,

01:33.688 --> 01:35.292
I can do all this from home?

01:37.164 --> 01:40.627
But, you squeezed your employees
to the breaking point,

01:40.662 --> 01:43.135
so they would cheat customers,

01:43.170 --> 01:46.336
and you could drive up
the value of your stock,

01:46.371 --> 01:48.767
and put hundreds
of millions of dollars

01:48.802 --> 01:50.373
in your own pocket.

01:50.408 --> 01:52.738
Last time, I think
it was your manager,

01:52.773 --> 01:56.379
mentioned that I was in
for a small business loan.

01:56.414 --> 01:58.216
Could we get that put together?

02:01.386 --> 02:04.354
Frank, are you there?

02:04.389 --> 02:06.521
Yeah, just--just a second.

02:08.327 --> 02:10.756
You accepted, all along,

02:10.791 --> 02:14.562
as this fraud built up,
this massive fraud.

02:14.597 --> 02:16.630
I'm--I'm really sorry
about this.

02:16.665 --> 02:18.731
Just give me one second.

02:20.801 --> 02:22.570
In 2008,

02:22.605 --> 02:25.441
Wall Street promised change,

02:25.476 --> 02:28.609
but it looks like
it is business as usual.

02:28.644 --> 02:31.612
A giant bank
cheats the little guys,

02:31.647 --> 02:34.516
and the executives
line their own pockets.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.837
No, no, no, no, no, no, okay,
okay, don't shoot, don't shoot,

03:31.872 --> 03:33.476
-don't shoot.
-Don't touch the button

03:33.511 --> 03:34.675
-or we'll shoot.
-Okay, I'm not.

03:37.944 --> 03:40.252
Everyone else
on your stomachs now!

03:40.287 --> 03:43.321
Don't touch your phones,
purses, nothing!

03:43.356 --> 03:45.752
Let me see your hands,
make sure I can see 'em!

03:45.787 --> 03:47.358
And you,
what are you still doing?

03:47.393 --> 03:49.558
-Get on the floor.
-Fuck you, she's pregnant.

03:49.593 --> 03:51.461
On her side then, now!

03:51.496 --> 03:55.333
Nobody has to get hurt,
just do what I say!

04:05.378 --> 04:08.577
What do you think they want?
There can't be much here.

04:11.648 --> 04:13.450
Oh, my God, Jesus.

04:16.917 --> 04:19.555
121, come in, 121.

04:30.535 --> 04:32.799
Where's Frank?

04:34.770 --> 04:37.474
Enough!

04:37.509 --> 04:40.378
Where's your phone?

04:40.413 --> 04:41.907
Okay.

04:41.942 --> 04:44.547
121, what's your 20?

04:47.684 --> 04:49.519
Really? Door.

04:54.592 --> 04:56.559
You're going to
respond to dispatch.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.833
Not a word off.

05:09.706 --> 05:11.343
Ready?

05:11.378 --> 05:13.609
Dispatch, this is 121,
we have a--

05:15.547 --> 05:18.746
I said, "Not a word."

05:18.781 --> 05:22.519
I was just calling it in.

05:22.554 --> 05:24.488
Dispatch, this is 121.

05:24.523 --> 05:27.557
All secure,
just routine maintenance.

05:38.636 --> 05:41.736
I don't have a phone.

05:41.771 --> 05:44.640
He says he doesn't have one.

05:44.675 --> 05:46.004
It's true, it's true, he told--

05:46.039 --> 05:48.776
Shut up.

05:48.811 --> 05:50.448
I don't believe him.

05:56.621 --> 05:58.621
Are you having fun back there?

05:58.656 --> 06:00.689
Shut up.

06:03.628 --> 06:06.090
Okay, that's enough.

06:06.125 --> 06:09.632
-That's enough.
-What the fuck are you doing?

06:09.667 --> 06:11.766
I'm not doing it like this.

06:11.801 --> 06:15.000
Okay, we need
those last two phones.

06:17.774 --> 06:19.444
You cover the front, all right?

06:21.481 --> 06:23.712
Listen, I can handle this.

06:23.747 --> 06:25.076
The signal's down anyways.

06:29.819 --> 06:31.456
I'm calling an audible.

06:34.791 --> 06:36.791
Don't make me regret this.

06:48.475 --> 06:51.036
I apologize
if he was a little rough.

06:54.107 --> 06:55.942
Is it really possible that
somebody this day and age

06:55.977 --> 06:58.010
-doesn't have a cellphone?
-You're looking at him.

07:01.246 --> 07:02.784
I think he just wants
to make sure that

07:02.819 --> 07:04.852
-you don't have a gun.
-Well, I don't.

07:09.496 --> 07:11.991
I mean, you're a painter?

07:14.897 --> 07:17.865
You could probably scrape by
on what, 40, 50,000 a year?

07:21.739 --> 07:22.969
I'm not judging you.

07:25.072 --> 07:26.808
If you give me an hour,
I'll give you more money

07:26.843 --> 07:28.975
than you've seen in a lifetime,

07:29.010 --> 07:31.648
and it's
100-percent untraceable.

07:31.683 --> 07:33.111
Yeah, right.

07:41.088 --> 07:42.527
I'm not joking.

07:45.092 --> 07:48.060
All of you are victims
of the most corrupt bank

07:48.095 --> 07:50.700
in history,
and today is your bailout.

07:52.231 --> 07:53.802
You don't have to like
what happens here today,

07:53.837 --> 07:55.738
but nobody has to
get hurt either.

07:57.940 --> 07:59.676
Can you pat him down again?

07:59.711 --> 08:01.172
Oh, come on.

08:04.309 --> 08:07.618
I gave you the opportunity, sir,
he's just, uh--

08:07.653 --> 08:09.884
he's just trying
to keep everyone safe.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.723
Thought you could hide that?

08:16.156 --> 08:18.662
Sir,

08:18.697 --> 08:21.192
I do hope you cooperate with me
going forward, all right?

08:23.130 --> 08:24.932
I wanna make sure everybody
gets out of here alive today,

08:24.967 --> 08:26.296
okay?

08:28.641 --> 08:30.938
And you,

08:30.973 --> 08:32.775
there's no need
to cover for him.

08:57.703 --> 08:58.900
Charger.

09:15.149 --> 09:17.820
Okay, everything's as planned,

09:17.855 --> 09:19.085
we just need to find
the last phone,

09:19.120 --> 09:20.691
and then we can get out of here.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.296
The other missing phone
is yours?

09:34.707 --> 09:36.333
Okay.

09:38.073 --> 09:40.942
What the fuck are you doing?

09:40.977 --> 09:42.779
The longer we're in this lobby,

09:42.814 --> 09:44.913
the more difficult
this is going to be.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.246
I know you're jacked up
right now, but it's not helping.

09:48.281 --> 09:50.149
I need you to
calm the fuck down.

09:52.021 --> 09:53.691
Please.

09:55.893 --> 09:57.959
Okay.

10:00.194 --> 10:03.030
-Is the phone in your car?
-I--I think so.

10:03.065 --> 10:04.735
Okay, let's go, come on.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.297
Hurry it the fuck up,
if we're still here

10:06.332 --> 10:08.739
in 10 minutes, I'm calling it.

10:17.112 --> 10:19.684
-Yeah?
-Watch future dad over there.

10:19.719 --> 10:22.181
Yeah, no fucking kidding.

10:22.216 --> 10:24.755
All right,
we're opening the door.

10:24.790 --> 10:28.187
Nobody say a goddamn thing.

10:28.222 --> 10:29.925
Come on.

10:34.866 --> 10:36.393
All right.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.670
We're gonna get through this,
you're doing just fine.

10:45.008 --> 10:46.205
Hey.

10:48.407 --> 10:51.045
If something goes down,
can I rely on you?

10:53.819 --> 10:56.050
Knock it off,
we already told you,

10:56.085 --> 10:57.722
there's no need for that.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.318
Where's the manager?

11:00.353 --> 11:01.792
Shit.

11:04.929 --> 11:07.424
Hey, man, hey,
you guys closed already?

11:08.999 --> 11:11.065
Yes, sir, how can I help you?

11:11.100 --> 11:13.001
Well, the ATM isn't closed,
though, right?

11:13.036 --> 11:14.937
No, ATM never closes.

11:30.383 --> 11:32.284
Okay.

11:35.223 --> 11:37.157
Excuse me.

11:37.192 --> 11:38.961
Let's see that phone, phone.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.943
Why's he sending the driver away
if he's just here for cash?

11:53.978 --> 11:56.011
Tell him we're closed.

11:56.046 --> 11:58.783
I did.

11:58.818 --> 12:00.312
And he's already seen my face.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.056
Okay.

12:08.091 --> 12:11.125
Okay, I'll take care of it.

12:11.160 --> 12:13.391
-Excuse me, sir.
-All right, you know the drill?

12:13.426 --> 12:16.130
Yeah, I got it, don't worry.

12:16.165 --> 12:19.837
-How can I help you?
-Uh, the ATM's down.

12:19.872 --> 12:21.872
-The ATM is down?
-Yeah, yeah, you need, like,

12:21.907 --> 12:23.368
the weight of a car,
or something like that.

12:23.403 --> 12:26.272
It's like a sensor or something.

12:26.307 --> 12:29.077
Well, I know that there is
a branch down the road

12:29.112 --> 12:31.145
that has a walk-up ATM.

12:31.180 --> 12:34.412
I mean, isn't there
an ATM in there, right?

12:34.447 --> 12:36.216
Yes, sir, but I'm sorry,
we just closed

12:36.251 --> 12:37.888
-a few minutes ago.
-Come on, man,

12:37.923 --> 12:39.186
I just need, like, 20 bucks.

12:42.356 --> 12:45.093
You're right, I'm sorry.

12:45.128 --> 12:46.523
Come on in.

12:52.102 --> 12:54.300
Well, fuck.

13:29.007 --> 13:30.974
All right,
let's get the camera going.

13:31.009 --> 13:33.075
You aren't giving me
a whole lot of options here.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.442
Is that a threat?

13:37.477 --> 13:40.280
-You said this wasn't personal.
-It's not.

13:40.315 --> 13:42.051
Then, you don't need
to have your face

13:42.086 --> 13:43.613
-on the camera like that.
-Listen, we're already here.

13:43.648 --> 13:46.583
Can we please finish
what we came to do?

13:46.618 --> 13:50.862
Fine, but if you go off book
one more time,

13:50.897 --> 13:54.228
I will pin this whole
goddamn thing on you.

14:10.378 --> 14:12.983
One of y'all gonna
do something brave?

14:38.043 --> 14:40.307
What's your name?

14:40.342 --> 14:42.012
Megan.

14:43.378 --> 14:45.675
Listen, everything--

14:45.710 --> 14:47.281
everything's gonna be fine.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.350
Okay?

14:50.385 --> 14:52.484
Yeah, you don't need
to worry about them.

14:57.656 --> 14:59.293
I think we could take 'em.

14:59.328 --> 15:02.164
Can you not threaten
the dude with the gun?

15:02.199 --> 15:03.935
Enough!

15:05.301 --> 15:07.004
Well, where's the manager?

15:09.371 --> 15:11.701
I assure you that
the manager is fine.

15:13.705 --> 15:15.672
Is this your first panic attack?

15:15.707 --> 15:18.510
-Can you back off for just--?
-My meds are in my bag.

15:24.518 --> 15:27.519
Okay, when's the last time
you took one?

15:27.554 --> 15:30.555
Um, an hour ago,

15:30.590 --> 15:33.030
or it was 20 minutes.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.329
I don't remember.

15:35.364 --> 15:38.431
There's paper bags
in the break room.

15:40.435 --> 15:43.304
Okay, can you take her
to go get that, please?

15:43.339 --> 15:45.141
Really?

15:45.176 --> 15:47.143
Is that necessary?

15:47.178 --> 15:49.508
Ideally I think we'd all like
Megan to be able to breathe.

15:51.380 --> 15:52.984
And while you're gone,
please consider

15:53.019 --> 15:55.382
who you're gonna contact.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.516
What?

15:57.551 --> 15:59.287
Constant contact, right?

15:59.322 --> 16:02.686
Everybody's got one,
somebody that's awaiting

16:02.721 --> 16:05.722
some meme response, an email,
a text, a phone call, whatever.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.526
Somebody like that, okay?

16:07.561 --> 16:09.759
I don't want anybody wondering
where we're at right now.

16:12.170 --> 16:13.499
Who's phone is this?

16:13.534 --> 16:15.567
Uh, that'd be me.

16:36.755 --> 16:39.492
-Frank.
-Keep your voice down.

16:49.768 --> 16:52.703
You guys have a PowerPoint
on how to get away with a heist?

16:52.738 --> 16:55.409
Something like that.

16:55.444 --> 16:57.048
But, we're not the ones
getting away with it.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.582
How did he get a lighter?

17:03.617 --> 17:05.815
So far the only person
these guys have robbed is me

17:05.850 --> 17:08.455
of a smoke break.

17:12.758 --> 17:15.594
I'm not just
saying it to say it.

17:15.629 --> 17:17.629
I'm gonna need a smoke.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.239
This political?

17:25.771 --> 17:27.309
What isn't these days?

17:30.446 --> 17:32.248
-Don't point that thing at me.
-I--

17:32.283 --> 17:34.316
I heard the shot
in the back, what?

17:34.351 --> 17:35.548
This is not
what it looks like, Allison.

17:35.583 --> 17:37.253
-Well then, what is it?
-They're bullets.

17:37.288 --> 17:39.189
They're all blanks.

17:41.556 --> 17:43.688
What?

17:49.465 --> 17:52.235
So, uh, who should we contact?

17:52.270 --> 17:54.138
Uh, I don't know,

17:54.173 --> 17:55.535
my roommates.

17:57.704 --> 18:00.309
Just like that,
you expect us to comply?

18:00.344 --> 18:01.574
No, you're not
complying with me,

18:01.609 --> 18:03.444
you're complying with him.

18:05.382 --> 18:08.581
-Should we text them?
-No, no, Morse code.

18:08.616 --> 18:11.485
-Of course text.
-What's your fucking game?

18:11.520 --> 18:13.619
-Hey!
-Hey, uh--

18:13.654 --> 18:15.588
No, I--I don't--

18:15.623 --> 18:17.293
Does it look like
I'm playing with you?

18:17.328 --> 18:19.427
No, what?

18:19.462 --> 18:22.364
You--you wanted me
to think you were dead?

18:22.399 --> 18:24.597
He's going to
explain everything.

18:27.668 --> 18:29.800
Is this, like, a--
a hidden camera show

18:29.835 --> 18:31.802
-or something?
-No, it isn't.

18:31.837 --> 18:33.375
-Frank, just--
-You are going to have to

18:33.410 --> 18:34.805
-follow my lead.
-Tell me what is going on.

18:34.840 --> 18:37.874
If I had the time,
I would explain everything.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.217
Look, would I ever
put you in danger?

18:43.651 --> 18:45.585
You message on
a third-party app, right?

18:45.620 --> 18:48.423
-Encrypted?
-Yeah.

18:48.458 --> 18:49.853
Smart man.

18:49.888 --> 18:51.723
What should we tell them?

18:55.696 --> 18:59.368
Um, I don't know, how about,

18:59.403 --> 19:02.899
"Got held up, be home soon"?

19:02.934 --> 19:05.374
Cute one.

19:05.409 --> 19:06.672
Are they expecting you?

19:08.577 --> 19:10.676
Yeah, we usually go out
on Saturday nights.

19:10.711 --> 19:11.908
Particular time?

19:15.683 --> 19:18.552
You know,
just whenever we all get home.

19:18.587 --> 19:21.456
Which is?

19:21.491 --> 19:23.557
It can vary.

19:23.592 --> 19:25.196
Okay.

19:35.538 --> 19:37.604
Where'd you even get that thing?

19:37.639 --> 19:40.805
Collin isn't always around
when I'm closing.

19:42.677 --> 19:44.776
-Ready?
-Wait.

19:44.811 --> 19:47.911
Was--was this always a part
of the plan, you telling me?

19:47.946 --> 19:49.715
I don't even know anymore,
he wasn't supposed to

19:49.750 --> 19:51.453
-take his mask off.
-But, he wants you

19:51.488 --> 19:53.950
to close down the bank?

19:53.985 --> 19:56.821
Let me suggest
closing down the bank.

19:56.856 --> 19:58.988
Why would he do that?

19:59.023 --> 20:00.726
Do you totally trust them?

20:12.509 --> 20:14.608
So,

20:14.643 --> 20:17.875
that'll be Eric, Joe,

20:17.910 --> 20:19.745
and TJ that we're texting?

20:19.780 --> 20:21.714
How'd you--?

20:21.749 --> 20:24.288
I need to close down the bank,

20:24.323 --> 20:25.619
if you don't want
the security company

20:25.654 --> 20:28.259
-calling again.
-Allison.

20:28.294 --> 20:30.327
If you don't want this
turning into a shootout.

20:30.362 --> 20:31.625
Now that's a really good idea.

20:31.660 --> 20:33.561
I should've
thought of that myself.

20:33.596 --> 20:35.662
Can you do my deposit for me?

20:35.697 --> 20:37.631
Really, can we just
let them have what they want

20:37.666 --> 20:39.402
so we can get out of here?

20:39.437 --> 20:40.799
That's exactly right,
we need to make sure

20:40.834 --> 20:42.702
that nobody's expecting us.

20:42.737 --> 20:44.770
Why do you need
to deposit that check?

20:44.805 --> 20:46.640
Because my rent's due
by tomorrow.

20:46.675 --> 20:48.708
I think your landlord's
gonna understand.

20:48.743 --> 20:51.348
No, we are depositing
that check,

20:51.383 --> 20:54.549
just like we had
to text your roommates.

20:57.983 --> 20:59.488
And you're gonna keep
a real close eye on

20:59.523 --> 21:01.589
Ms. Manford for me, right?

21:04.088 --> 21:06.363
Good.

21:06.398 --> 21:07.826
Who's next?

21:11.535 --> 21:13.029
Someone's taken a branch.

21:15.836 --> 21:17.605
What do you mean
"taken a branch"?

21:20.577 --> 21:23.413
The link to this footage
was sent to me directly.

21:23.448 --> 21:24.909
No sign of where
it's coming from.

21:26.979 --> 21:28.682
They don't even
have the sound on.

21:28.717 --> 21:30.585
Just seems like they want me
to know that they're in.

21:32.622 --> 21:34.919
So, do we know for certain
this is live?

21:34.954 --> 21:36.789
Do we have the luxury
of doubting it?

21:45.096 --> 21:47.668
We're not gonna
negotiate with terrorists.

21:47.703 --> 21:51.342
That's just it, they haven't
sent me any demands.

21:51.377 --> 21:53.542
That's why I didn't
send you the link.

21:53.577 --> 21:55.379
At this point,

21:55.414 --> 21:56.809
you have plausible deniability.

21:59.814 --> 22:01.880
All right, then we'll just--

22:08.152 --> 22:09.690
Holy shit.

22:23.904 --> 22:26.740
There's no one to contact,
otherwise we'd do it.

22:40.888 --> 22:42.954
Is this a joke to you?

22:42.989 --> 22:45.022
Can you tell them to get
the fucking gun off of her?

22:46.960 --> 22:48.432
Yes, of course.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.505
I'm sorry, I--

22:55.540 --> 22:58.805
He's trying to
move this along, okay?

22:58.840 --> 23:00.642
I already told you, we were
going home and staying there

23:00.677 --> 23:02.809
the rest of the afternoon,
no one was expecting us.

23:02.844 --> 23:06.142
Right, but you're not home now.

23:06.177 --> 23:09.079
You're here, so.

23:09.114 --> 23:10.652
Just do what he wants.

23:13.019 --> 23:16.757
Victoria's bound to
come over for something.

23:16.792 --> 23:18.627
Your sister?

23:18.662 --> 23:19.958
No, neighbor.

23:22.765 --> 23:24.732
Did you lock the back door
on your way out?

23:27.033 --> 23:28.164
Yeah.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.641
Why don't we call Victoria
and ask her to check?

23:34.480 --> 23:35.875
That's a great idea.

23:57.866 --> 24:00.570
Hi, Victoria, it's Maria.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.539
Yeah, yeah, yes, no problem.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.899
Yes, yes.

24:32.934 --> 24:34.868
No problem.

24:37.169 --> 24:40.269
Uh, we decided
to go to the mall.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.974
Hello?

24:44.880 --> 24:47.584
Would you mind seeing
if we locked the back door?

24:47.619 --> 24:49.047
How can I help you?

24:52.789 --> 24:54.690
Yeah, thank you.

24:54.725 --> 24:56.087
That--that would be great.

24:56.122 --> 24:58.122
Yeah, see you, bye.

25:22.951 --> 25:24.918
Yeah.

25:24.953 --> 25:27.283
We should be back up
and closed down

25:27.318 --> 25:29.560
for the evening.

25:29.595 --> 25:30.957
You got that on your end?

26:11.868 --> 26:13.736
Oh, God.

26:13.771 --> 26:16.101
-Ah, Frank, you scared--
-Frank?

26:16.136 --> 26:18.741
No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:18.776 --> 26:21.744
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

26:24.276 --> 26:25.847
Sure.

26:25.882 --> 26:27.343
We need anything else?

26:29.380 --> 26:32.755
Okay, sounds good.

26:32.790 --> 26:35.087
I'll swing by and see you soon.

26:35.122 --> 26:37.023
Bye-bye.

26:37.058 --> 26:38.695
Good.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.257
And I suggest that
you actually stop at the store

26:40.292 --> 26:43.326
on the way home just to
make everything appear normal.

26:47.233 --> 26:48.705
You were in on this.

26:50.335 --> 26:53.138
Didn't wanna call
your bestie Frank, huh?

26:53.173 --> 26:55.712
What are you doing?

26:55.747 --> 26:57.714
What are you doing, Jane?

26:59.982 --> 27:02.785
Come--come on, Frank,
enough is enough, all right.

27:02.820 --> 27:04.149
Oh, she's right, Frank.

27:06.857 --> 27:09.660
I told you not to wear one
to begin with.

27:17.131 --> 27:19.670
-What exactly is this shit?
-All right, calm down.

27:24.435 --> 27:28.272
So, these others at the table,

27:28.307 --> 27:30.274
they seem to know this guy.

27:32.113 --> 27:35.114
If I were to guess,
I'd have to say that she's--

27:35.149 --> 27:38.689
she's an employee.

27:38.724 --> 27:41.153
Everybody else just looks
dressed like a customer.

27:42.992 --> 27:46.125
So, perhaps he's
an employee as well.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.765
Do you recognize him?

27:48.800 --> 27:51.394
We have over 6,000 branches.

27:53.134 --> 27:54.837
I always knew this bank
was stealing from me,

27:54.872 --> 27:56.333
but goddamn.

27:59.404 --> 28:01.404
The quicker everyone
clears their alibi,

28:01.439 --> 28:03.472
the quicker we can explain.

28:03.507 --> 28:05.749
Explain why you're
taking your own bank hostage?

28:05.784 --> 28:07.212
Why don't you
show us how it's done?

28:10.415 --> 28:12.250
Not a bad idea.

28:14.419 --> 28:16.452
Okay.

28:16.487 --> 28:18.960
All right.

28:18.995 --> 28:20.489
I'll text Greg.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.898
We play basketball
on Saturdays now and again.

28:22.933 --> 28:24.735
-What about your wife?
-Do you see a ring

28:24.770 --> 28:27.001
-on his finger?
-I never married.

28:27.036 --> 28:28.365
Nah,

28:28.400 --> 28:31.005
wasn't legal
till a couple years ago.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.007
Now, what does that
have to do with anything?

28:33.042 --> 28:34.338
It doesn't.

28:36.144 --> 28:39.013
Fair enough.

28:39.048 --> 28:41.851
Uh-uh.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.182
We'll type it for you.

29:02.434 --> 29:05.402
Okay, all right, all right,
calm down, calm down.

29:05.437 --> 29:08.339
We need to calm down
so we can all get one, right?

29:10.816 --> 29:12.178
Go for Senator McHenry.

29:14.116 --> 29:15.511
Okay, getting her now.

29:23.257 --> 29:25.356
Ma'am, you have a phone call.

29:25.391 --> 29:27.864
Ugh, well,

29:27.899 --> 29:31.131
um, unfortunately
I have to go back to work.

29:31.166 --> 29:33.397
There's no rest
for civil service.

29:33.432 --> 29:35.135
But,

29:35.170 --> 29:37.467
it is Ms. Starla's birthday,

29:37.502 --> 29:40.503
so she is gonna be the one
to hand out the party favors.

29:40.538 --> 29:42.340
Thank you,
happy birthday, sweetheart.

29:42.375 --> 29:44.012
Here you go, babe.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.082
It's Daniels.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.862
A branch has been breached.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.457
Jesus.

30:00.492 --> 30:03.097
You know I don't need to know
about those things.

30:16.442 --> 30:18.376
-Get me a secure line.
-Already on it.

30:22.019 --> 30:24.085
That plaque.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.384
-That one?
-Right there.

30:26.419 --> 30:29.123
We rolled that out
a couple of months back.

30:29.158 --> 30:31.928
Morale booster.

30:31.963 --> 30:35.459
A dozen or so branches
that received them.

30:35.494 --> 30:37.329
I'll get that list, sir.

30:43.634 --> 30:45.436
Yes, sir.

30:45.471 --> 30:48.406
Just wanted you to know that
that composite you wanted

30:48.441 --> 30:51.046
is in stock.

30:51.081 --> 30:52.883
Yep.

30:52.918 --> 30:56.480
Should be able to get started
first thing Monday morning.

30:56.515 --> 30:58.053
Yep.

30:58.088 --> 30:59.384
All right.

30:59.419 --> 31:01.419
You have a good night now.

31:01.454 --> 31:02.651
Talk to you soon.

31:04.556 --> 31:06.061
There.

31:07.999 --> 31:10.131
Can I have a cigarette now?

31:10.166 --> 31:11.429
Who's this, Willy?

31:13.631 --> 31:15.598
That's my wife.

31:18.438 --> 31:21.109
That's my daughter's page,
right?

31:21.144 --> 31:23.947
Is your daughter Robin Tucker?

31:23.982 --> 31:27.148
I want you to take a look at
when that was posted.

31:27.183 --> 31:29.612
That's the last photo of my wife

31:29.647 --> 31:31.317
before she started chemo.

31:33.222 --> 31:35.552
Yeah, but--but your ring.

31:35.587 --> 31:38.390
What, I don't wanna
doubt the guy either.

31:38.425 --> 31:40.029
I don't know, do we want
Mrs. Spitz to come

31:40.064 --> 31:41.965
looking for him?

31:42.000 --> 31:44.066
You know, with these guys?

31:48.237 --> 31:50.435
I can't believe I'm saying this.

31:50.470 --> 31:52.701
Verify it.

31:52.736 --> 31:55.440
Look it up.

32:04.319 --> 32:07.386
Unfortunately it looks like
it's more like 25 locations

32:07.421 --> 32:09.388
-that received the plaques.
-Let me guess, we hit up

32:09.423 --> 32:11.621
every region, huh?

32:11.656 --> 32:13.491
On a map it would
look like a carpet bombing.

32:16.661 --> 32:18.232
Morale.

32:21.237 --> 32:23.534
"Willy, her husband of 39 years,

32:23.569 --> 32:25.569
a career painter and landscaper,

32:25.604 --> 32:28.440
was the love of her life.

32:28.475 --> 32:30.376
When she got sick,
he built a park bench

32:30.411 --> 32:33.313
for Johnson Park,
where they first met.

32:33.348 --> 32:35.117
Says he'll continue
to go there every day

32:35.152 --> 32:37.746
until he sees Sheryl again.

32:37.781 --> 32:41.090
Sheryl is survived
by her husband,

32:41.125 --> 32:43.290
-and daughter Robin."
-That's enough.

32:46.625 --> 32:50.297
She took care of
all the banking stuff.

32:50.332 --> 32:52.497
She's the whole reason
I was even here today.

32:54.633 --> 32:57.073
Would your daughter be expecting
to see you this afternoon?

33:00.342 --> 33:02.177
We haven't talked in a while.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.133
Collin, why don't you go next?

33:30.174 --> 33:31.668
Sure.

33:31.703 --> 33:34.176
I'll call my wife.

33:34.211 --> 33:36.178
Tell her I'm staying late.

33:36.213 --> 33:37.707
I've already told
the security company

33:37.742 --> 33:39.577
that we're locked up
for the night.

33:39.612 --> 33:42.184
Do you ever stop for a beer
on the way home?

33:42.219 --> 33:44.186
-Not even to watch the game?
-No.

33:44.221 --> 33:46.683
She wouldn't believe that.

33:46.718 --> 33:50.159
You could get a jacket,

33:50.194 --> 33:53.096
a new jacket for your daughter.

33:56.497 --> 33:57.760
Yeah, that'll work.

33:59.731 --> 34:01.764
-Okay, a call?
-Text.

34:07.442 --> 34:09.508
Let me type it.

34:12.249 --> 34:14.216
The dozen major
security companies

34:14.251 --> 34:17.450
that we partner with
all have subcontractors

34:17.485 --> 34:20.222
based in their area.

34:20.257 --> 34:22.422
But, clearly if
we haven't been notified,

34:22.457 --> 34:24.457
these guys have
smoke-screened them somehow,

34:24.492 --> 34:27.130
-so we--
-Don't propose anything

34:27.165 --> 34:30.760
that asserts we go public
with this information.

34:30.795 --> 34:32.861
That's why you were hired,

34:32.896 --> 34:35.633
to assure we don't
have to do that.

34:35.668 --> 34:37.173
Yes, sir.

34:38.902 --> 34:41.111
You have his phone number.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.245
Give it to me and I'll find him.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.815
What the fuck
do you want me to do?

34:52.850 --> 34:55.356
Look, we're gonna
do this together, okay?

34:55.391 --> 34:57.622
And your rent check
got deposited, right?

34:59.923 --> 35:01.890
Soon you're never gonna have to
worry about a rent check again,

35:01.925 --> 35:05.432
-so.
-Maybe I can call my landlord

35:05.467 --> 35:07.863
and tell him
my check was deposited.

35:07.898 --> 35:09.832
Okay, would that--
would that be normal?

35:09.867 --> 35:12.340
-What do you mean?
-Do you talk to your landlord?

35:12.375 --> 35:14.342
-Not really.
-Jesus Christ,

35:14.377 --> 35:16.872
-just do it for her.
-Will you please stop?

35:16.907 --> 35:18.313
-I'm trying.
-All right,

35:18.348 --> 35:20.282
who do you talk to every day?

35:20.317 --> 35:23.318
-My mom.
-Have you spoken with her today?

35:23.353 --> 35:25.452
She reminded me this morning
about my rent.

35:25.487 --> 35:28.587
Okay, why don't we call her
and let her know it's done?

35:30.921 --> 35:32.657
She's gonna know
something's wrong.

35:32.692 --> 35:34.593
-Why?
-Because she'll hear it

35:34.628 --> 35:38.465
-in my voice.
-Why don't we text her?

35:38.500 --> 35:40.599
Do you think that will work?

35:40.634 --> 35:43.833
Maybe, she told me to call her
when I was done.

35:43.868 --> 35:45.868
Do you always call your mom
when she asks you to?

35:49.478 --> 35:52.314
Okay, so that's what we'll do,
we'll text her.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.516
See, it's gonna be fine.

35:58.586 --> 36:00.751
We're gonna get out of here.

36:04.922 --> 36:06.427
Add a smiley.

36:17.968 --> 36:20.672
Okay, if I do this,
then you promise

36:20.707 --> 36:22.872
-everyone gets out?
-Yes.

36:22.907 --> 36:24.808
It's almost over, Allison.

36:26.911 --> 36:29.450
-Who do you wanna contact?
-My mother.

36:29.485 --> 36:31.782
Original.

36:33.819 --> 36:35.621
She's watching my kid.

36:35.656 --> 36:38.228
Is it typical you stay
this long closing up?

36:38.263 --> 36:40.593
No, we're normally gone
within an hour.

36:40.628 --> 36:42.298
Half hour.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.432
Why hasn't she called you
wondering where you are?

36:44.467 --> 36:47.369
She has him till 8:00 tonight.

36:49.406 --> 36:51.703
Girl's night out?

36:51.738 --> 36:54.508
I was going to see a movie.

36:56.809 --> 36:58.743
Okay, well,

36:58.778 --> 37:01.284
let's call away--

37:01.319 --> 37:03.319
Actually, I usually FaceTime.

37:05.521 --> 37:07.884
Hey, Mom,
when are you coming home?

37:07.919 --> 37:10.392
Soon, baby,
just be good for Nana

37:10.427 --> 37:11.723
and I'll be home soon, okay?

37:11.758 --> 37:14.627
Mom, I really want
you to come home.

37:14.662 --> 37:16.024
Micah, no sir.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.336
Honey, I gotta go.

37:22.472 --> 37:24.670
Ally, are you all right?

37:24.705 --> 37:26.309
Maybe, I--

37:28.511 --> 37:31.006
I--I just don't like
when he acts like this.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.843
It reminds me of his father.

37:32.878 --> 37:35.747
Honey, don't worry, just--
just go on and have a good time.

37:35.782 --> 37:37.683
Everything is gonna
be okay, okay?

37:37.718 --> 37:39.289
We'll--we'll talk
to you real soon.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.621
Okay.

37:41.656 --> 37:43.326
Good save.

37:46.496 --> 37:47.957
You mind if I ask
about their dad?

37:53.668 --> 37:55.767
Divorced and out of state.

37:59.377 --> 38:02.037
All right.

38:02.072 --> 38:03.940
Well, listen, everybody,
that was the, um--

38:03.975 --> 38:05.909
that's the hard part, it's over.

38:07.946 --> 38:09.319
Frank, do you wanna
take somebody

38:09.354 --> 38:10.650
to get a pot of coffee going?

38:10.685 --> 38:12.014
Coffee?

38:12.049 --> 38:14.423
Are you kidding me right now?

38:14.458 --> 38:15.754
No, does anybody else
want any coffee?

38:15.789 --> 38:18.053
-Does that sound good?
-Cigarette?

38:18.088 --> 38:19.824
Sure.

38:22.400 --> 38:24.697
Yeah.

38:24.732 --> 38:26.963
No, Allison, not you.

38:26.998 --> 38:28.800
Somebody else.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.677
Why don't you tell me
who you want me to take?

38:41.848 --> 38:43.551
Megan.

38:46.919 --> 38:50.118
Can you...not in here?

38:50.153 --> 38:51.856
What?

38:51.891 --> 38:53.462
She's pregnant.

38:57.127 --> 38:58.929
Why do you keep
your cellphone in your boot?

38:58.964 --> 39:01.998
'Cause I'd rather have cancer
in my ankle than in my head.

39:20.018 --> 39:22.788
How long have you known
about all of this?

39:28.697 --> 39:30.730
Look, I know that
nothing I can say

39:30.765 --> 39:33.095
is gonna make you
feel any better,

39:33.130 --> 39:35.603
but I promise you
that in the next 15 minutes

39:35.638 --> 39:37.737
you're gonna look at
this whole thing differently.

39:48.651 --> 39:50.849
Well, congratulations, everyone,
from this point forward,

39:50.884 --> 39:54.050
your lives are
unabashedly your own.

39:54.085 --> 39:55.722
Are you all familiar with
the recent news coverage

39:55.757 --> 39:57.493
-on JD Wells?
-Are you talking about

39:57.528 --> 39:59.561
-the fraudulent credit cards?
-That would be the most recent,

39:59.596 --> 40:01.695
-yes.
-But, that was resolved, right?

40:01.730 --> 40:03.730
Yes, it was.

40:03.765 --> 40:05.963
They paid a fine,
and our CEO stepped down.

40:05.998 --> 40:08.031
Well, that depends on
your definition of "resolved."

40:08.066 --> 40:09.769
"Your" CEO?

40:09.804 --> 40:11.903
You're technically just
a subcontractor, aren't you?

40:11.938 --> 40:13.905
-Same difference.
-So, this is revenge?

40:13.940 --> 40:16.006
The bank paid a fine,

40:16.041 --> 40:17.711
they paid their customers back,

40:17.746 --> 40:20.109
and the CEO stepped down, right?

40:20.144 --> 40:22.815
But, he stepped down with
$124 million severance.

40:22.850 --> 40:25.114
Wait, severance, like,
he got paid to quit?

40:25.149 --> 40:27.523
That's exactly right,
and so did the other executive

40:27.558 --> 40:29.085
who headed up
the entire scandal.

40:29.120 --> 40:32.759
-Was anyone imprisoned?
-Bankers don't go to prison.

40:32.794 --> 40:34.530
Just bank robbers.

40:34.565 --> 40:36.664
That's very wise, Mr. Spitz.

40:36.699 --> 40:38.699
-But, they paid a fine.
-The bank did.

40:38.734 --> 40:40.701
The executives didn't,
and what, it was, like,

40:40.736 --> 40:43.033
only $180 million,
or something like that?

40:43.068 --> 40:45.002
-Only $180 million?
-The bank's worth

40:45.037 --> 40:47.708
-at least a couple trillion.
-1.9.

40:47.743 --> 40:49.677
Where are you going with this?

40:49.712 --> 40:52.207
This is the bank's
internal server.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.814
The $2.6 million they stole
through fraudulent cards

40:54.849 --> 40:56.145
is nothing.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.587
They took $36 billion
from taxpayers

40:58.622 --> 41:00.215
during the bailout.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.723
Almost every bank
had that going on.

41:02.758 --> 41:04.956
He's right,
and they were all bailed out.

41:04.991 --> 41:06.892
But, more than half
of the sub-prime mortgages

41:06.927 --> 41:09.961
in the crisis started
right here at JD Wells.

41:09.996 --> 41:11.567
There's no reason
to be defensive.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.734
Just hear him out.

41:13.769 --> 41:16.198
No, this is just
the tip of the iceberg.

41:17.773 --> 41:19.234
Shit.

41:28.685 --> 41:30.685
But, more than half
of the sub-prime mortgages

41:30.720 --> 41:33.853
in the crisis started
right here at JD Wells.

41:33.888 --> 41:35.283
There's no reason
to be defensive.

41:39.124 --> 41:40.761
Why would you send me that?

41:40.796 --> 41:44.567
Well, now this is
both our problems, isn't it?

41:44.602 --> 41:48.604
Didn't your mother teach you:
don't open links from strangers?

41:48.639 --> 41:50.672
This is a secure line.

41:50.707 --> 41:52.905
Is it?

41:52.940 --> 41:54.709
Well, what are you waiting for?

41:54.744 --> 41:57.140
We're still figuring out
where he's at.

41:57.175 --> 41:59.010
There are
government agencies for that.

42:01.344 --> 42:02.981
So, you're ready
to derail this train

42:03.016 --> 42:05.720
after everything
we've been through?

42:05.755 --> 42:07.216
What about
the upcoming campaign?

42:07.251 --> 42:09.218
Don't try that Southern comfort
bullshit with me.

42:09.253 --> 42:11.792
-What do you want?
-You've already been bought.

42:11.827 --> 42:13.959
What more can you offer?

42:27.843 --> 42:29.843
Don't ever compromise.

42:32.782 --> 42:35.244
What if I told you that when
an executive makes it to the top

42:35.279 --> 42:37.851
of JD Wells, they're rewarded
with what's called

42:37.886 --> 42:39.248
a "ghost account"?

42:46.631 --> 42:49.060
Filled to the brim with profits

42:49.095 --> 42:51.095
from insider trading,

42:51.130 --> 42:53.130
illegal hidden fees,

42:53.165 --> 42:54.637
and interest fraud.

42:54.672 --> 42:56.771
I'd say prove it.

42:56.806 --> 42:58.201
Show him.

43:00.777 --> 43:04.240
That account there belongs to
the CEO of JD Wells.

43:06.948 --> 43:08.618
How do you trace
where all that's coming from?

43:08.653 --> 43:11.049
That's not the illegal one.

43:11.084 --> 43:13.623
He used to be the COO
before the scandal.

43:13.658 --> 43:15.317
Should we be looking at this?

43:15.352 --> 43:17.990
Well, this is all
public information.

43:18.025 --> 43:19.959
Our executives every year
allow their information

43:19.994 --> 43:23.259
to be published,
so this is nothing new.

43:23.294 --> 43:24.898
Show 'em the next one.

43:27.265 --> 43:29.166
That's his hidden account,

43:29.201 --> 43:32.202
not disclosed to the public
nor the IRS.

43:32.237 --> 43:34.105
It's $182 million.

43:34.140 --> 43:37.207
Okay, so how do you
know all this?

43:37.242 --> 43:40.111
A little birdie told me.

43:40.146 --> 43:41.915
Show 'em the next one.

43:44.755 --> 43:47.151
That's the Chief
Technology Officer's.

43:47.186 --> 43:49.890
She's obviously
doing a little bit better.

44:18.789 --> 44:22.384
You know
I'm dedicated to my job,

44:22.419 --> 44:24.727
and if it's all true,

44:24.762 --> 44:27.257
I should know,

44:27.292 --> 44:29.259
so that I'm prepared.

44:35.872 --> 44:37.674
It's all bullshit.

45:12.271 --> 45:14.469
So, you guys are "black hats."

45:14.504 --> 45:17.373
Hack-tivists.

45:17.408 --> 45:18.847
They're what now?

45:18.882 --> 45:21.146
They're hackers.

45:21.181 --> 45:23.214
You can trust us.

45:23.249 --> 45:24.754
You can't be serious.

45:26.318 --> 45:28.285
I'm very serious.

45:32.192 --> 45:34.357
Can I talk to you outside
for a second?

45:37.296 --> 45:40.000
All right,
how long have you known TJ?

45:40.035 --> 45:41.364
-What, TJ?
-Yes.

45:41.399 --> 45:43.366
Oh shit,
I thought she was a part

45:43.401 --> 45:46.974
-of some Anonymous-type shit.
-Keep your voice down, please.

45:47.009 --> 45:49.042
Nobody is with Anonymous,
you understand?

45:49.077 --> 45:51.077
Right, you can't admit it,

45:51.112 --> 45:52.848
that's the whole point.

45:52.883 --> 45:56.115
So, he shows you a few numbers
and now you're a hacker?

46:01.188 --> 46:03.485
Just let him finish.

46:03.520 --> 46:06.026
Listen, I need you
to tone it down in there.

46:06.061 --> 46:07.357
All right, I don't want
everyone thinking that

46:07.392 --> 46:09.898
I'm trying to con them,
or something.

46:09.933 --> 46:11.801
All right, mom's the word, man.

46:13.530 --> 46:17.037
Look, I've got all your info,
I know you're not

46:17.072 --> 46:18.434
-from around here.
-So?

46:18.469 --> 46:22.339
So, I know you're
keeping things from me.

46:22.374 --> 46:25.078
TJ's my roommate?

46:26.983 --> 46:29.181
Just forget it.

46:50.171 --> 46:53.106
So, how do y'all feel
about taking it?

47:07.023 --> 47:08.583
Even if we believe
half the shit you just said,

47:08.618 --> 47:11.091
what makes you think we're gonna
take this stupid deal?

47:11.126 --> 47:12.895
-He just showed you proof.
-Maria,

47:12.930 --> 47:15.161
-that could've been doctored.
-What does he have to gain

47:15.196 --> 47:16.492
-by mocking that up?
-You tell us,

47:16.527 --> 47:18.527
did you mock it up?

47:20.971 --> 47:23.037
You're joking, right?

47:25.910 --> 47:28.636
Nothing's been mocked up,
this is real.

47:28.671 --> 47:30.143
Tell them, Frank.

47:33.379 --> 47:36.248
Hey, what was that little
meeting in the hall about?

47:36.283 --> 47:38.415
-He's not lying.
-Hey,

47:38.450 --> 47:40.890
half hour ago
you were wearing a mask.

47:40.925 --> 47:44.190
Us, that's--that's what
he gains by all of this.

47:44.225 --> 47:45.928
He's getting us
to go along with it

47:45.963 --> 47:47.358
so that he can get away with it.

47:47.393 --> 47:49.030
Can't even give away
a couple million dollars,

47:49.065 --> 47:50.933
-can you?
-Then, why not keep it all

47:50.968 --> 47:53.430
-for yourself?
-He wants to spread the blame.

47:53.465 --> 47:55.036
It'll be too long
and complicated

47:55.071 --> 47:57.071
to try all of us.

47:57.106 --> 47:59.436
Yeah, but by then, we'd have
enough money to fight it.

47:59.471 --> 48:01.504
A trial,
what are we talking about?

48:01.539 --> 48:04.672
We're not actually
doing this, are we?

48:45.550 --> 48:47.957
Fight it with what,
stolen money?

48:47.992 --> 48:49.717
Stolen money that doesn't exist.

48:49.752 --> 48:51.191
You're a part of all this.

48:51.226 --> 48:52.291
How the hell can we trust you?

48:52.326 --> 48:53.589
These are powerful people.

48:53.624 --> 48:55.657
They'll figure it out
and get rid of us.

48:55.692 --> 48:58.132
No, that would just
open up an investigation.

48:58.167 --> 48:59.595
No, they have
more money than God.

48:59.630 --> 49:00.695
They'll get away with it.

49:00.730 --> 49:02.235
No, they won't.

49:02.270 --> 49:04.468
They get away with it,
we get away with it.

49:04.503 --> 49:06.536
-Two wrongs don't make a right.
-Yeah, but sometimes

49:06.571 --> 49:09.077
four gets you right back
to where you started.

49:09.112 --> 49:10.639
Joking's not
gonna help anything.

49:10.674 --> 49:11.706
More smartass bullshit.

49:11.741 --> 49:14.148
We're not goin' along with this.

49:14.183 --> 49:17.118
Well, it's already been done.

49:17.153 --> 49:18.548
-Excuse me?
-You already did it?

49:18.583 --> 49:19.989
That's right!

49:20.024 --> 49:21.188
In a few days, you'll all be

49:21.223 --> 49:22.717
the richest people
that you know.

49:32.267 --> 49:34.069
Get ready to pull the stream.

49:42.145 --> 49:44.508
He's doing it.

49:44.543 --> 49:47.478
Ha! He's doin' it.

49:47.513 --> 49:49.480
-What?
-Refund?

49:49.515 --> 49:51.383
Yes, refunds,

49:51.418 --> 49:53.418
bill pay, cash transfers,
that kind of stuff.

49:53.453 --> 49:54.419
That's how it's gonna
show up in your accounts.

49:54.454 --> 49:55.754
Yeah, 'cause that
won't get red-flagged.

49:55.789 --> 49:58.324
No, it won't because they're all
gonna be small enough amounts

49:58.359 --> 50:01.096
that it's not gonna
raise any suspicion.

50:01.131 --> 50:03.593
Got it on good authority
that we're in the clear.

50:03.628 --> 50:06.530
This could be
a new start for us.

50:06.565 --> 50:08.367
Just wanted to document
here what a real-world

50:08.402 --> 50:10.171
Daddy Warbucks looks like.

50:10.206 --> 50:12.338
Aaron, please do not post that.

50:12.373 --> 50:14.505
It's just for me, man.

50:14.540 --> 50:15.803
You won't get away with this.

50:15.838 --> 50:17.442
Get away with it?

50:17.477 --> 50:19.510
He just gave you
a couple thousand dollars.

50:21.580 --> 50:23.580
Yeah, and Frank made sure
you were in on it.

50:23.615 --> 50:25.681
-Allison.
-What?

50:25.716 --> 50:28.057
You make half a million
a year yourself,

50:28.092 --> 50:30.191
not including what
your husband makes.

50:30.226 --> 50:33.425
Therefore I don't know where
this money could do some good?

50:33.460 --> 50:34.756
Yeah, what the fuck

50:34.791 --> 50:37.594
do you care?

50:37.629 --> 50:41.136
Oh, the food bank?

50:41.171 --> 50:42.731
Yes, the food bank.

50:42.766 --> 50:44.337
Really? Is that your sob story?

50:44.372 --> 50:47.439
"I robbed the bank
for the children?"

50:52.545 --> 50:54.677
I don't need a sob story.

50:54.712 --> 50:56.118
In a few weeks,
you'll both have more money

50:56.153 --> 50:58.120
-than you make in a year.
-What about them?

50:58.155 --> 51:00.353
You don't steal from these
people and get away with it.

51:00.388 --> 51:02.487
They will see
what we want them to see,

51:02.522 --> 51:04.192
on their end,
on their interface,

51:04.227 --> 51:07.426
it'll just be another
million-dollar day.

51:07.461 --> 51:08.724
We'll turn you in.

51:08.759 --> 51:10.726
Collin, stop
defending these people.

51:10.761 --> 51:13.201
-They don't deserve it.
-And, and, for what?

51:13.236 --> 51:15.698
For giving you millions
that no one will ever miss?

51:15.733 --> 51:19.768
For threatening
and endangering our lives!

51:23.411 --> 51:25.147
What the hell was that?

51:34.323 --> 51:35.389
Let the record show

51:35.424 --> 51:39.194
that no one ever had
a live round pointed at them.

51:39.229 --> 51:40.360
-I did!
-Yeah?

51:40.395 --> 51:42.131
Well, Frank,
you were in on this.

51:42.166 --> 51:45.464
And this was not the plan!

51:45.499 --> 51:47.631
Honestly, I hope you all
live your lives to the fullest

51:47.666 --> 51:50.271
after what we've
accomplished here today.

51:50.306 --> 51:52.636
Collin, look out!

51:52.671 --> 51:55.177
We are not leaving this room
until everyone agrees

51:55.212 --> 51:56.442
never to speak of this!

51:56.477 --> 51:58.543
And who's gonna make us?

51:58.578 --> 51:59.644
Everyone, shut up!

51:59.679 --> 52:02.316
Everyone just shut up
and someone hand me my phone

52:02.351 --> 52:03.779
-right now!
-Jane is right.

52:03.814 --> 52:05.583
This is not
what we talked about.

52:05.618 --> 52:06.782
Just hand me my phone.

52:06.817 --> 52:08.223
Allison, careful.

52:08.258 --> 52:09.719
-Hand me my phone.
-Careful.

52:09.754 --> 52:10.918
You hand her the phone,

52:10.953 --> 52:12.326
and we all go to prison.

52:12.361 --> 52:14.262
And you'd have to shoot me,

52:14.297 --> 52:15.692
but I know you
don't wanna do that.

52:15.727 --> 52:19.498
So, could we just sit down
and talk this out?

52:19.533 --> 52:22.369
We talked while he
turned us into criminals.

52:22.404 --> 52:24.206
Just give me my phone.

52:33.679 --> 52:35.382
Can we just back out of this?

52:35.417 --> 52:37.285
There's no use.

52:37.320 --> 52:39.881
-Signal's down again.
-Shut up!

52:39.916 --> 52:42.323
Give Collin his gun back.

52:42.358 --> 52:43.522
He's a little busy

52:43.557 --> 52:45.656
-right now.
-Allison, Allison.

52:45.691 --> 52:48.296
Frank, what the hell
is going on?

52:48.331 --> 52:49.397
You hurt that girl,

52:49.432 --> 52:52.333
-and I'll kill you.
-No one is going to hurt anyone!

52:52.368 --> 52:53.829
Allison, if you shoot
anyone in this room,

52:53.864 --> 52:55.270
you're gonna
have to kill us all.

52:55.305 --> 52:56.535
Shut up!

52:56.570 --> 52:58.867
I've got this!

52:58.902 --> 53:03.443
Look, you can keep the gun.

53:03.478 --> 53:04.377
Just lower it,

53:04.413 --> 53:06.842
and let's sit down
and talk about this.

53:10.419 --> 53:12.815
Him first.

53:12.850 --> 53:15.587
Okay.

53:15.622 --> 53:16.984
Can we agree to that?

53:18.922 --> 53:21.263
What do you say?

53:21.298 --> 53:22.759
Why not?

53:26.028 --> 53:27.236
Okay.

53:29.933 --> 53:33.605
-Okay.
-Someone may be dead.

53:33.640 --> 53:36.773
We can bury his allegations,
easy enough.

53:36.808 --> 53:39.006
We can even bury the code,

53:39.041 --> 53:41.250
-but a body?
-Please, if that's the case,

53:41.285 --> 53:43.780
he signed his fate
as a terrorist.

53:43.815 --> 53:45.914
The video that proves
he killed someone

53:45.949 --> 53:48.389
also discusses
everything going on.

53:48.424 --> 53:50.589
Then if I were you, I'd stop
trying to politicize this,

53:50.624 --> 53:52.789
and I would bury
that code right away.

54:01.932 --> 54:03.866
Okay.

54:23.987 --> 54:25.591
You really shouldn't
have done that.

54:25.626 --> 54:28.957
Yeah, and we shouldn't
still be here either.

54:28.992 --> 54:30.431
Whoa, hold on.

54:30.466 --> 54:33.335
Ho--Try and stop me.

54:33.370 --> 54:35.898
Please.

54:35.933 --> 54:39.671
When were you going to let me in
all of these plan changes?

54:39.706 --> 54:41.772
-Things change, all right?
-What the fuck is going on?

54:41.807 --> 54:42.674
What the fuck are you doing?

54:42.709 --> 54:43.774
Just let him go!

54:43.809 --> 54:45.842
-And implicate us all?
-Implicate?

54:45.877 --> 54:47.580
We're going to
figure this all out.

54:47.615 --> 54:49.879
Who the hell do you
think you are?

54:49.914 --> 54:51.716
How did any of you

54:51.751 --> 54:53.817
think this was going to work?

54:53.852 --> 54:56.325
Because it already has worked.

55:00.661 --> 55:02.331
Haven't we already
been down this road?

55:02.366 --> 55:03.794
If I have to put my gun down,

55:03.829 --> 55:07.028
he shouldn't be able
to touch his laptop.

55:07.063 --> 55:08.997
That's apples to apples.

55:09.032 --> 55:10.702
Eh, fair enough.

55:14.037 --> 55:17.005
You said everybody was gonna
have the opportunity to opt in.

55:17.040 --> 55:18.239
Well, I think it
became very obvious

55:18.275 --> 55:20.976
that they wouldn't unless
I showed them personal proof.

55:21.011 --> 55:22.516
So you took away
our choice in the matter?

55:22.551 --> 55:25.948
I'm sorry I gave you
all that money.

55:25.983 --> 55:28.423
If you want out,
you can walk out.

55:30.592 --> 55:32.020
And how we supposed to do that

55:32.055 --> 55:34.528
with that asshole
standin' there?

55:36.730 --> 55:38.730
If we promise
to walk out safely,

55:38.765 --> 55:40.061
will you get out of the way?

55:40.096 --> 55:42.096
Sure.

55:42.131 --> 55:45.099
If she gives me her gun first.

55:45.134 --> 55:46.804
How 'bout it?

55:46.839 --> 55:49.070
Why does it matter
if we all agree?

55:49.105 --> 55:52.447
If no one leaks this,
we all benefit.

56:06.023 --> 56:08.430
Allison?

56:08.465 --> 56:09.893
What are you doing?

56:28.551 --> 56:30.012
Feeling better now?

56:31.950 --> 56:35.424
Is that all that was for you?

56:35.459 --> 56:37.085
What else would it be?

56:52.509 --> 56:54.003
I'm not sayin'
that I'm doin' this,

56:54.038 --> 56:56.676
but, uh,

56:56.711 --> 56:58.172
what about the taxes?

56:58.207 --> 57:01.208
Do you report cash deposits
straight into your account?

57:01.243 --> 57:03.980
What about electronic
transfers between accounts?

57:04.015 --> 57:05.114
Why let us in on this?

57:05.150 --> 57:07.852
Spreading the blame
can't be worth all this risk.

57:07.887 --> 57:09.689
You can call me an idealist,

57:09.724 --> 57:12.219
or a patriot if that
makes you feel better.

57:12.254 --> 57:13.187
A terrorist.

57:13.222 --> 57:15.893
Yeah, didn't Oswald
call himself a patriot?

57:15.928 --> 57:18.764
You're trying to redeem yourself
for being a part of this?

57:18.799 --> 57:20.799
Look, just because you
don't exactly understand

57:20.834 --> 57:22.097
what I've done here today

57:22.132 --> 57:24.704
doesn't change the fact
that it's happened.

57:24.739 --> 57:28.004
No sum of money
is worth this shit.

57:28.039 --> 57:29.874
Does that mean you're
gonna turn us in?

57:31.548 --> 57:34.175
Not necessarily,
I mean, you know,

57:34.210 --> 57:36.881
what's done is done, right?

57:36.916 --> 57:38.586
So, just like that?

57:38.621 --> 57:40.214
You turn a blind eye?

57:40.249 --> 57:42.656
Hey, I got no intentions
of spendin' my final days

57:42.691 --> 57:43.987
in a jail cell.

57:44.022 --> 57:46.759
These executives were born
in the same world as us,

57:46.794 --> 57:48.156
and they choose to exploit it.

57:48.191 --> 57:50.026
And that gives us
a right to take it?

57:50.061 --> 57:52.600
If we just accept this,
we are just like them.

57:52.635 --> 57:55.768
No, these are the 20 most
affluent people in the world.

57:55.803 --> 57:57.902
You are nothing like them.

58:00.038 --> 58:02.643
If he says he gave it to us,

58:02.678 --> 58:04.711
-I'm not gonna argue.
-Exactly.

58:04.746 --> 58:05.679
Why should we go to prison

58:05.714 --> 58:07.747
for something that we
had nothing to do with?

58:07.782 --> 58:09.210
Aiding and abetting.

58:09.245 --> 58:10.948
How?

58:10.983 --> 58:12.620
Did you help them
type up all that code?

58:12.655 --> 58:14.589
And a court would have to
establish that, right?

58:14.624 --> 58:17.119
But if we decide here and now
that no one's gonna tell anyone,

58:17.154 --> 58:18.725
that's all a non-issue.

58:18.760 --> 58:21.090
We take this to our graves,
or we all go down.

58:21.125 --> 58:24.258
We can't all possibly
keep this under wraps.

58:24.293 --> 58:27.030
Honestly, you think that not one
of us is gonna go to the cops

58:27.065 --> 58:29.703
as soon as we step
outside those doors?

58:43.213 --> 58:44.619
Releasing the video would just

58:44.654 --> 58:47.083
throw us directly into the fire.

58:51.958 --> 58:54.321
But...

58:54.356 --> 58:57.797
we don't wanna be 100 percent
reactionary to this.

59:06.709 --> 59:09.578
You still workin'
on that location?

59:09.613 --> 59:11.272
You'll know when I know.

59:17.951 --> 59:21.887
So, maybe we get ahead of this.

59:21.922 --> 59:23.658
What do you have in mind?

59:25.728 --> 59:28.124
I'm not ruining anyone's
life just because,

59:28.159 --> 59:33.228
just because this strange
opportunity fell in our lap.

59:33.263 --> 59:35.835
Maria, what are you saying?

59:35.870 --> 59:38.299
If my silence means
a better future for our child,

59:38.334 --> 59:40.070
so be it.

59:40.105 --> 59:42.204
I'm in.

59:42.239 --> 59:43.942
And I won't change my mind.

59:43.977 --> 59:45.075
Of course you are.

59:45.110 --> 59:45.976
What's that supposed to mean?

59:46.011 --> 59:47.209
Means you're just
another millennial

59:47.244 --> 59:48.683
looking for a handout.

59:48.718 --> 59:49.981
Think what you want, man.

59:50.016 --> 59:51.851
Is that what you think
of all millennials?

59:56.693 --> 59:57.824
Do you all not see

59:57.859 --> 1:00:00.926
how this money
could do some good?

1:00:00.961 --> 1:00:04.061
Credit cards, mortgages,
student loans?

1:00:04.096 --> 1:00:06.734
Car payments?

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:08.901
Medical bills?

1:00:08.936 --> 1:00:11.101
That's all gone!

1:00:11.136 --> 1:00:14.676
Money does not equal happiness.

1:00:14.711 --> 1:00:15.875
Amen.

1:00:15.910 --> 1:00:17.910
That, we might never agree on.

1:00:17.945 --> 1:00:19.747
Look, this is
getting us nowhere.

1:00:21.751 --> 1:00:23.212
All right, this is gonna
sound a little crazy,

1:00:23.247 --> 1:00:25.654
but can I see a show of hands?

1:00:25.689 --> 1:00:26.985
Who's willing
to walk out of here

1:00:27.020 --> 1:00:28.987
and never speak of this again?

1:00:37.833 --> 1:00:40.229
And, of course, me.

1:00:40.264 --> 1:00:43.672
There is no choice,
just the illusion of one.

1:00:43.707 --> 1:00:45.971
It doesn't matter what we do.

1:00:46.006 --> 1:00:47.302
So, that's a yes?

1:00:47.337 --> 1:00:49.007
No.

1:00:49.042 --> 1:00:50.910
We're still not
100 percent here.

1:00:53.750 --> 1:00:54.914
How do you mean?

1:00:54.949 --> 1:00:57.411
Him, Mr. Washington.

1:00:57.446 --> 1:00:59.149
What are you talkin' about?

1:00:59.184 --> 1:01:01.217
What, you weren't
gonna tell 'em?

1:01:01.252 --> 1:01:02.383
That you're FBI?

1:01:02.418 --> 1:01:03.791
What the fuck are you doin'?

1:01:03.826 --> 1:01:05.694
Way to confirm it, big man.

1:01:05.729 --> 1:01:08.092
What are you doin'
in my face, huh?

1:01:08.127 --> 1:01:09.896
Huh, you wanna shoot me?

1:01:09.931 --> 1:01:12.162
Wanna shoot me, then
go ahead and fuckin' do it!

1:01:12.197 --> 1:01:14.329
Blow this whole fuckin'
thing off the roof!

1:01:14.364 --> 1:01:16.771
Do not test me.

1:01:16.806 --> 1:01:18.740
Don't test you?

1:01:18.775 --> 1:01:20.434
You better do it
or back the fuck up

1:01:20.469 --> 1:01:21.974
because we're trying to do
something good here,

1:01:22.009 --> 1:01:23.371
and you're getting in the way.

1:01:30.512 --> 1:01:32.413
I figured you'd
all wanna know that.

1:01:34.890 --> 1:01:36.021
Having a bureau man
as protection

1:01:36.056 --> 1:01:37.825
goes a pretty long way,
doesn't it?

1:01:39.928 --> 1:01:42.027
Now I won't tell 'em
your name, unless you make me.

1:01:44.394 --> 1:01:45.899
What do you think, Collin, huh?

1:01:45.934 --> 1:01:48.231
You're so fuckin'
high and mighty.

1:01:48.266 --> 1:01:51.465
Think the FBI
wanna know about this?

1:01:51.500 --> 1:01:53.742
I'm sure they're
already tracking it.

1:01:53.777 --> 1:01:55.744
Couldn't have
said it better myself.

1:01:57.143 --> 1:01:59.847
So, he's your inside guy.

1:01:59.882 --> 1:02:02.751
There's proper channels
for whistleblowers.

1:02:02.786 --> 1:02:04.247
Within the system, right?

1:02:04.282 --> 1:02:06.821
Run it up the flag pole?

1:02:06.856 --> 1:02:08.218
That same system
that you're defending

1:02:08.253 --> 1:02:09.989
is the very arm of the law

1:02:10.024 --> 1:02:13.190
designed to
investigate such crimes,

1:02:13.225 --> 1:02:15.324
and even he can't help
but take a piece.

1:02:15.359 --> 1:02:17.062
What are you talkin' about?

1:02:17.097 --> 1:02:19.900
They told us they wouldn't
take anything for themselves.

1:02:19.935 --> 1:02:21.902
That's right, Jane.

1:02:21.937 --> 1:02:25.532
This was supposed to be
an act of moral principle.

1:02:25.567 --> 1:02:27.941
-Do you wanna see?
-No, just

1:02:27.976 --> 1:02:30.240
tell us what this
is really about.

1:02:30.275 --> 1:02:32.506
The original plan,

1:02:32.541 --> 1:02:33.640
the one that Frank
keeps alluding to,

1:02:33.676 --> 1:02:36.147
we were supposed to come in
and secure the location,

1:02:36.182 --> 1:02:38.787
buy time, make the hack,
and get the fuck out.

1:02:38.822 --> 1:02:41.449
Yeah, but you fucked that plan
when you took your mask off.

1:02:41.484 --> 1:02:43.891
And you got selfish.

1:02:43.926 --> 1:02:45.827
I don't know what
you're talkin' about.

1:02:45.862 --> 1:02:47.829
It's on the computer.

1:02:47.864 --> 1:02:49.831
Do you wanna see?
Does anybody else wanna see?

1:02:49.866 --> 1:02:51.800
-He's lying.
-Am I?

1:02:51.835 --> 1:02:53.428
What about you?

1:02:53.463 --> 1:02:55.001
Who are you?

1:02:57.269 --> 1:02:59.335
Just tryin' to bring
a little balance to this mess.

1:02:59.370 --> 1:03:00.369
Oh?

1:03:00.405 --> 1:03:02.338
Oh, and you think
you're the one to do that?

1:03:02.373 --> 1:03:04.406
That's a little arrogant,
don't you think?

1:03:04.441 --> 1:03:05.574
What?

1:03:05.609 --> 1:03:08.047
You're defending him,
the guy still wearing a mask?

1:03:08.082 --> 1:03:09.983
You risked our lives,

1:03:10.018 --> 1:03:12.216
your own

1:03:12.251 --> 1:03:14.515
to make this
look like a robbery?

1:03:14.550 --> 1:03:17.089
To hand over some cash?

1:03:17.124 --> 1:03:18.959
Fortune favors the bold.

1:03:18.994 --> 1:03:21.192
No, you coulda done this
from your couch.

1:03:21.227 --> 1:03:22.930
There's something
you're not telling us.

1:03:22.965 --> 1:03:24.327
Just how much exactly
do you think you

1:03:24.362 --> 1:03:26.263
don't understand, Collin?

1:03:26.298 --> 1:03:28.397
Fuck you.

1:03:28.432 --> 1:03:31.334
Oh, my, I'd say we're making
some great progress here,

1:03:31.369 --> 1:03:32.973
now, aren't we?

1:03:36.473 --> 1:03:38.814
I need to take a piss.

1:04:03.302 --> 1:04:07.073
Where are you going?

1:04:07.108 --> 1:04:09.075
I'm not allowed to go?

1:04:18.218 --> 1:04:20.482
So how long have you
been divorced?

1:04:33.233 --> 1:04:36.069
-I admire your courage, Collin.
-My personal life

1:04:36.104 --> 1:04:38.038
has nothing to do with this.

1:04:38.073 --> 1:04:40.139
I'm sure you'd like us
all to believe that.

1:04:42.011 --> 1:04:44.110
Your family deserves this.

1:04:46.411 --> 1:04:47.674
You know what I do
three nights a week?

1:04:47.709 --> 1:04:51.117
Step out on your family
with Allison?

1:04:51.152 --> 1:04:54.252
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

1:04:54.287 --> 1:04:58.256
My family's never taken
a single thing they didn't earn.

1:04:58.291 --> 1:04:59.554
I'm not starting now.

1:04:59.589 --> 1:05:02.095
That's pride talking.

1:05:02.130 --> 1:05:04.031
I mean, he has a point though.

1:05:04.066 --> 1:05:06.462
Isn't life hard enough
without being a single mother?

1:05:06.497 --> 1:05:08.596
Earlier today, we were
begging for a mortgage.

1:05:08.631 --> 1:05:11.071
Now our children
won't beg for anything.

1:05:12.569 --> 1:05:14.602
Night classes,

1:05:14.637 --> 1:05:16.340
criminal justice.

1:05:16.375 --> 1:05:19.244
So your family can know
the injustice of their father

1:05:19.279 --> 1:05:21.477
and husband
dying in the streets?

1:05:21.512 --> 1:05:23.083
I'll put a gun to
your head for the camera,

1:05:23.118 --> 1:05:26.119
if it'll make you feel better.

1:05:26.154 --> 1:05:27.989
You've been saying all day
"Let's just get out of here,"

1:05:28.024 --> 1:05:30.090
and now you wanna be a hero?

1:05:30.125 --> 1:05:31.388
Don't you think
a woman like yours

1:05:31.423 --> 1:05:33.962
would do a lot more
with this money than

1:05:33.997 --> 1:05:36.360
those bankers?

1:05:36.395 --> 1:05:39.396
Don't be afraid of
being hypocritical, Collin.

1:05:39.431 --> 1:05:41.101
We all are.

1:05:47.769 --> 1:05:49.340
Well, apparently,

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:51.606
because you and I
are sleeping together,

1:05:51.641 --> 1:05:53.707
I'm just supposed to
go along with all this.

1:05:53.742 --> 1:05:56.644
-Collin.
-So sick of this shit!

1:05:56.679 --> 1:05:58.613
I can't believe
we're outnumbered here!

1:05:58.648 --> 1:06:00.450
What's wrong is wrong!

1:06:00.485 --> 1:06:02.056
Wrong is just a line in the sand

1:06:02.091 --> 1:06:05.356
that changes with every tide.

1:06:05.391 --> 1:06:06.720
How do you supposed
to argue with that?

1:06:06.755 --> 1:06:08.623
How 'bout you
sit down and shut up.

1:06:08.658 --> 1:06:09.624
No!

1:06:09.659 --> 1:06:10.526
You're gonna have to shoot me.

1:06:10.561 --> 1:06:15.333
Collin, sit down!

1:06:15.368 --> 1:06:16.631
Now.

1:06:20.439 --> 1:06:22.175
Sit down.

1:06:29.217 --> 1:06:31.481
Now, Frank,

1:06:31.516 --> 1:06:34.319
Frank, you are the one
who got us into this mess,

1:06:34.354 --> 1:06:37.058
so tell us,

1:06:37.093 --> 1:06:38.719
how do we get out of it?

1:06:38.754 --> 1:06:42.525
We all agree to disagree
and we walk.

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:44.692
Someone wants to
go to the cops, fine.

1:06:44.727 --> 1:06:46.562
Where's the proof?

1:06:46.597 --> 1:06:48.729
This company gave me

1:06:48.764 --> 1:06:50.665
my first real job.

1:06:50.700 --> 1:06:54.108
Don't be ridiculous!

1:06:54.143 --> 1:06:56.704
I gave you your first job.

1:06:56.739 --> 1:06:58.508
So, you

1:06:58.543 --> 1:07:01.115
are more of a martyr than him?

1:07:01.150 --> 1:07:04.349
I've worked here for longer
than you've been alive,

1:07:04.384 --> 1:07:07.649
and they spat in my face.

1:07:07.684 --> 1:07:10.355
They stole from
a quarter of the planet.

1:07:10.390 --> 1:07:13.787
You are naive for thinking
you can't take this money.

1:07:13.822 --> 1:07:14.888
Enough, enough.

1:07:14.923 --> 1:07:17.263
Wouldn't you rather
spend the rest of your life

1:07:17.298 --> 1:07:18.396
with your son?

1:07:18.431 --> 1:07:21.102
Stop using my child against me.

1:07:27.440 --> 1:07:30.837
You know, if you care
so much about this, then

1:07:30.872 --> 1:07:33.081
why not include the Flores'?

1:07:33.116 --> 1:07:34.511
What?

1:07:36.251 --> 1:07:38.548
I didn't not
include the Flores'.

1:07:38.583 --> 1:07:40.121
Why not just

1:07:40.156 --> 1:07:41.683
sit them in a waiting room

1:07:41.718 --> 1:07:43.289
until all this went down,

1:07:43.324 --> 1:07:45.291
and you could change
their life forever?

1:07:45.326 --> 1:07:47.194
There was nothing I could do.

1:07:47.229 --> 1:07:49.427
You couldn't
pop your head out

1:07:49.462 --> 1:07:53.266
and just let them know
their mortgage was approved?

1:07:53.301 --> 1:07:55.532
I knew that if
we started the process,

1:07:55.567 --> 1:07:59.536
you would still be here
when these two guys came in.

1:07:59.571 --> 1:08:02.176
But no need for that
mortgage now, huh?

1:08:02.211 --> 1:08:04.343
I didn't wanna put
your child at risk.

1:08:04.378 --> 1:08:06.873
He was trying to
limit the shares.

1:08:06.908 --> 1:08:09.381
-You're not just two--
-Shares?

1:08:09.416 --> 1:08:12.153
There's no limit
to this kind of money!

1:08:12.188 --> 1:08:14.386
Why are we any less deserving
than your employees?

1:08:14.421 --> 1:08:16.652
Or her?

1:08:16.687 --> 1:08:18.489
Luckily, she came to get us.

1:08:20.757 --> 1:08:22.262
Jane?

1:08:26.862 --> 1:08:30.798
Look, I made a judgement call.

1:08:30.833 --> 1:08:32.470
So did I.

1:09:14.910 --> 1:09:16.877
Okay, new deal.

1:09:16.912 --> 1:09:18.549
We're gonna open-source this.

1:09:18.584 --> 1:09:19.847
We're gonna boot
the camera back up,

1:09:19.882 --> 1:09:21.387
and we're gonna need a take two.

1:09:21.422 --> 1:09:22.254
All right?

1:09:22.290 --> 1:09:23.620
Everybody's gonna
raise their hand

1:09:23.655 --> 1:09:25.325
in unanimous agreement.

1:09:25.360 --> 1:09:27.426
And then, afterwards,
I'm gonna give you the video.

1:09:27.461 --> 1:09:29.956
That means that we all get
to walk out of here alive

1:09:29.991 --> 1:09:31.958
with millions of dollars
in our account

1:09:31.993 --> 1:09:34.235
and video proof showing
that you were forced

1:09:34.270 --> 1:09:36.798
to take the deal at gunpoint.

1:09:36.833 --> 1:09:38.239
Does everybody like that?

1:09:38.274 --> 1:09:40.769
Does that make sense?

1:09:40.804 --> 1:09:43.343
Stop, I just want out of here!

1:09:47.382 --> 1:09:50.614
Collin, if you really
can't live with it,

1:09:50.649 --> 1:09:52.880
just donate it to
charity or something,

1:09:52.915 --> 1:09:56.455
I don't know, but we,

1:09:56.490 --> 1:09:58.622
we can't ruin
these people's lives.

1:10:01.825 --> 1:10:03.429
You think she can take it?

1:10:05.466 --> 1:10:07.466
I just needed to pay my rent.

1:10:07.501 --> 1:10:10.271
That was the only fuckin'
reason I was here today.

1:10:29.457 --> 1:10:30.819
Where are your pills?

1:10:36.662 --> 1:10:38.563
Black and white container.

1:11:02.688 --> 1:11:03.951
It's gonna be okay.

1:11:23.104 --> 1:11:25.775
Okay.

1:11:25.810 --> 1:11:27.546
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:11:31.112 --> 1:11:33.519
No, this isn't right.

1:11:33.554 --> 1:11:34.454
Collin.

1:11:34.489 --> 1:11:35.950
Look at her!

1:11:35.985 --> 1:11:38.557
Look at what all of you
have done to her!

1:11:38.592 --> 1:11:39.525
You don't think she'll crack?

1:11:39.560 --> 1:11:40.559
She's already broken!

1:11:40.594 --> 1:11:42.891
-Collin!
-You did this!

1:11:42.926 --> 1:11:44.398
Hey, don't you
want to silence her?

1:11:44.433 --> 1:11:45.828
Go ahead, do it, do it, do it!

1:11:45.863 --> 1:11:47.995
Go ahead, you wanna do it?
Fuck 'em, hm?

1:11:48.030 --> 1:11:49.766
You're the only one who can
make hard decisions, right?

1:11:49.801 --> 1:11:50.965
So why don't you do it?

1:11:52.936 --> 1:11:54.507
-Come on, fuckin' do it!
-Don't move!

1:11:54.542 --> 1:11:55.475
That's enough!

1:11:55.510 --> 1:11:56.509
It's okay, I got this.

1:11:56.544 --> 1:11:58.511
It's okay, I, I, I got it.

1:12:01.681 --> 1:12:03.351
-Get off your computer!
-Collin,

1:12:03.386 --> 1:12:04.847
-put the gun down!
-Can everyone just please

1:12:04.882 --> 1:12:06.486
calm the fuck down?

1:12:06.521 --> 1:12:08.587
Clearly, we're not getting
through to you, Collin, are we?

1:12:10.118 --> 1:12:11.251
-Allison, just--
-Whoa!

1:12:11.286 --> 1:12:13.460
-You two are going nowhere.
-Collin, put the gun down,

1:12:13.495 --> 1:12:14.593
you're gonna
get somebody killed!

1:12:14.628 --> 1:12:15.594
Okay.

1:12:15.629 --> 1:12:17.090
Where you gonna go, Collin, huh?

1:12:17.125 --> 1:12:18.960
Where you gonna go?

1:12:18.995 --> 1:12:20.698
What's your story?

1:12:20.733 --> 1:12:22.370
Ten people are
conspiring against you

1:12:22.405 --> 1:12:24.064
that are gonna steal
millions from ghost accounts

1:12:24.099 --> 1:12:25.670
and then give you a cut?

1:12:25.705 --> 1:12:27.067
Is that your story?

1:12:27.102 --> 1:12:29.509
You gotta know when
you're beat, son.

1:12:31.810 --> 1:12:35.812
I'm not going with you.

1:12:35.847 --> 1:12:37.913
I'm sorry, you're on your own.

1:12:39.752 --> 1:12:42.588
Look, look at that, huh?

1:12:42.623 --> 1:12:44.953
Don't do it.

1:12:44.988 --> 1:12:46.592
Think about that.

1:12:51.896 --> 1:12:54.666
Just let go.

1:12:54.701 --> 1:12:56.437
Just let it go.

1:13:09.045 --> 1:13:10.715
No, no, no, no, no, Megan!

1:13:10.750 --> 1:13:12.750
Megan, you're fine, you're fine!

1:13:12.785 --> 1:13:14.422
No!

1:13:16.624 --> 1:13:18.426
Oh, fuck!

1:13:18.461 --> 1:13:19.658
God!

1:13:22.091 --> 1:13:24.597
Is this what I got to fucking do
to get you to listen to me?

1:13:24.632 --> 1:13:26.797
God fuckin' dammit!

1:13:28.768 --> 1:13:31.065
God fucking dammit!

1:13:35.907 --> 1:13:38.039
Ah! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1:14:04.199 --> 1:14:05.506
-Frank, it looks--
-Yeah, I know

1:14:05.541 --> 1:14:07.068
that their application
says approved,

1:14:07.103 --> 1:14:08.608
but don't tell them that.

1:14:08.643 --> 1:14:09.840
Is something wrong?

1:14:09.875 --> 1:14:11.743
Just tell them to
come in on Monday,

1:14:11.778 --> 1:14:13.877
and I will walk them through it.

1:14:13.912 --> 1:14:16.616
Okay.

1:14:20.248 --> 1:14:22.050
Hi, sir, how can I help you?

1:14:22.085 --> 1:14:23.887
Yeah, I don't have
my account number.

1:14:23.922 --> 1:14:26.593
Y'all set me up on
a new business account, so.

1:14:26.628 --> 1:14:28.221
That, that's okay.

1:14:28.256 --> 1:14:30.927
Just go ahead
and fill this slip out

1:14:30.962 --> 1:14:33.193
to the best of your ability,
and I can do the rest.

1:14:33.228 --> 1:14:35.129
-Okay?
-All right.

1:14:35.164 --> 1:14:36.537
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.

1:14:36.572 --> 1:14:39.001
We're short-staffed
on Saturdays.

1:14:39.036 --> 1:14:40.739
I don't think I can
take off again Monday.

1:14:40.774 --> 1:14:42.708
Why don't I just drop
you off at work on Monday,

1:14:42.743 --> 1:14:45.579
and I'll come over here?

1:14:45.614 --> 1:14:46.514
All right.

1:15:09.638 --> 1:15:11.935
Um, I need my check
deposited by today.

1:15:11.970 --> 1:15:15.268
If I could maybe just get
a deposit slip really quickly?

1:15:15.303 --> 1:15:16.874
Yeah, I can take
care of that for you.

1:15:16.909 --> 1:15:20.306
It will be much quicker
if you come inside.

1:15:20.341 --> 1:15:21.813
Thank you.

1:16:00.755 --> 1:16:02.590
So if I get me one
of them new smartphones,

1:16:02.625 --> 1:16:04.251
I could do all this from home.

1:16:06.926 --> 1:16:07.958
Uh, yes, sir.

1:16:07.993 --> 1:16:08.792
All you need to do is

1:16:08.827 --> 1:16:10.356
download the JD Wells
banking app

1:16:10.391 --> 1:16:12.358
and you should be good to go.

1:16:14.362 --> 1:16:17.605
Now that'd may be
reason enough to get one.

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:18.906
But then again,

1:16:18.942 --> 1:16:21.939
I wouldn't have the pleasure
of seein' you now would I?

1:16:26.374 --> 1:16:28.649
I'm sorry about that.

1:16:43.292 --> 1:16:45.193
It's a bit busier
than we thought.

1:17:10.451 --> 1:17:12.957
Um, last time,

1:17:12.992 --> 1:17:14.761
think it was your manager,

1:17:14.796 --> 1:17:18.193
mentioned that I was up
for a small business loan.

1:17:18.228 --> 1:17:19.799
Can we get that put together?

1:17:24.707 --> 1:17:25.871
Did you barf?

1:17:42.824 --> 1:17:44.956
We're actually about to close,

1:17:44.991 --> 1:17:47.024
uh, I can set up
an appointment for you.

1:17:47.059 --> 1:17:48.454
When would be a good time?

1:17:50.458 --> 1:17:53.030
How 'bout first thing
Monday morning?

1:17:53.065 --> 1:17:55.131
Oh, sorry, hold on.

1:17:55.166 --> 1:17:58.299
Frank, can I get your assistance
at the front, please?

1:18:01.370 --> 1:18:03.205
Frank, are you there?

1:18:04.813 --> 1:18:06.439
Just, just a second.

1:18:14.449 --> 1:18:15.921
Shit.

1:18:26.098 --> 1:18:28.164
God.

1:18:28.199 --> 1:18:29.770
Sorry about that.

1:18:51.794 --> 1:18:54.828
I'm, I'm really sorry
about this, just

1:18:54.863 --> 1:18:56.423
give me one second.

1:20:07.463 --> 1:20:10.002
JD Wells internal security,
this is Pam.

1:20:10.037 --> 1:20:11.267
Is this an emergency?

1:20:11.302 --> 1:20:13.038
Looks like we lost
the camera stream

1:20:13.073 --> 1:20:15.205
for one of your branches.

1:20:15.240 --> 1:20:17.878
You got anything on your end?

1:20:17.913 --> 1:20:19.473
I think I remember
someone mentioning

1:20:19.508 --> 1:20:21.948
maintenance going on
at a couple locations.

1:20:21.983 --> 1:20:24.280
You're going to
respond to dispatch.

1:20:29.056 --> 1:20:30.924
Yeah, here it is.

1:20:30.959 --> 1:20:33.190
Out in the burbs
on Johnson Avenue.

1:20:33.225 --> 1:20:35.225
Routine maintenance.

1:20:35.260 --> 1:20:37.194
Looks like it's time we switch
out the internal batteries

1:20:37.229 --> 1:20:39.229
on those cams
if we lost the stream.

1:20:39.264 --> 1:20:40.626
I'd say so.

1:20:47.140 --> 1:20:48.373
Here we go.

1:20:48.408 --> 1:20:52.176
I'm seeing on my end that
they've verified over radio.

1:20:52.211 --> 1:20:55.014
This is what we get for
bein' the weekend shift, right?

1:20:55.049 --> 1:20:56.917
Nobody tells us nothin'.

1:20:56.952 --> 1:20:58.413
No shit.

1:20:58.448 --> 1:21:00.085
Have a good one.

1:21:50.203 --> 1:21:52.236
It's over?

1:21:52.271 --> 1:21:53.974
As far as we can tell.

1:21:54.009 --> 1:21:56.977
Nothing tragic?

1:21:57.012 --> 1:21:58.242
Time will tell.

1:22:02.446 --> 1:22:03.379
Any sort of hearing

1:22:03.414 --> 1:22:06.151
would likely be much
more complicated now.

1:22:08.089 --> 1:22:10.716
Well, I'll do what I do,
and you do what you do.

1:22:18.594 --> 1:22:20.561
You wanna know who he is?

1:22:27.702 --> 1:22:29.306
We hired him...

1:22:31.475 --> 1:22:33.981
...to audit our entire system.

1:22:36.216 --> 1:22:37.149
He must have found something

1:22:37.184 --> 1:22:39.745
he thought could be
interpreted this way.

1:22:43.289 --> 1:22:44.354
That was good,
but you might wanna

1:22:44.389 --> 1:22:46.422
rehearse it a bit more.

1:23:17.719 --> 1:23:19.224
Selfish, huh?

1:23:22.658 --> 1:23:24.559
What makes you think
it was for me?

1:23:24.594 --> 1:23:25.758
That's not the point.

1:23:33.207 --> 1:23:35.240
Everything that went wrong today

1:23:35.275 --> 1:23:36.472
was your fault.

1:23:38.113 --> 1:23:41.246
We coulda had this thing
wrapped in a bow hours ago,

1:23:41.281 --> 1:23:44.513
but you had to go get all
self-righteous on everybody.

1:23:44.548 --> 1:23:46.713
They don't know whether
to trust us or fear us,

1:23:46.748 --> 1:23:48.286
and that's thanks to me.

1:23:50.521 --> 1:23:52.455
Was that your plan for me too?

1:24:02.500 --> 1:24:05.468
I'd say you're the most
idealistic person I know

1:24:05.503 --> 1:24:08.108
if you weren't so
fuckin' convoluted.

1:24:44.905 --> 1:24:47.378
I know you think you
lost somethin' in there.

1:24:50.911 --> 1:24:52.581
And this might go in
one ear and out the other,

1:24:52.616 --> 1:24:54.550
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1:24:57.621 --> 1:24:59.357
I don't know what
this money means to you,

1:24:59.392 --> 1:25:04.263
but for me it means that

1:25:04.298 --> 1:25:05.627
when I die...

1:25:09.633 --> 1:25:12.436
...I actually mean
somethin' to my daughter.

1:25:17.641 --> 1:25:20.345
Psh.

1:25:20.380 --> 1:25:22.446
Don't be me, kid.

1:25:37.463 --> 1:25:39.793
Come in on Monday
like everything's normal.

1:25:40.961 --> 1:25:42.862
I...

1:25:42.897 --> 1:25:45.535
-I heard the shot in the back.
-This is not what you think,

1:25:45.570 --> 1:25:46.701
-Allison.
-Well, then what is it?

1:25:46.736 --> 1:25:48.802
The bullets are all blanks.

1:25:48.837 --> 1:25:53.840
I'm working on getting you
transferred to another branch,

1:25:53.875 --> 1:25:56.447
where maybe you don't get along
with the manager so well,

1:25:56.482 --> 1:25:59.417
and you can quit.

1:26:04.226 --> 1:26:05.555
Okay.

1:26:10.958 --> 1:26:11.891
You don't think she'll crack?

1:26:11.926 --> 1:26:13.497
She's already broken!

1:26:13.532 --> 1:26:15.466
You did this!

1:26:15.501 --> 1:26:16.667
Hey, don't you
wanna silence her?

1:26:16.702 --> 1:26:19.338
Go ahead, do it, do it, do it,
go ahead, you wanna do it?

1:26:19.373 --> 1:26:20.669
You're the only one that can
make hard decisions, right?

1:26:20.704 --> 1:26:22.704
So why don't you do it,
make the hard decision.

1:26:31.583 --> 1:26:33.649
I made a judgement call.

1:26:33.684 --> 1:26:35.486
So did I.

1:26:47.962 --> 1:26:50.897
You hand her the phone,
and we all go to prison.

1:27:04.517 --> 1:27:06.814
My family's never taken
a single thing they didn't earn.

1:27:06.849 --> 1:27:08.354
I'm not starting now.

1:27:08.389 --> 1:27:10.323
That's pride talking.

1:27:10.358 --> 1:27:12.721
This could be
a new start for us.

1:27:16.628 --> 1:27:18.760
Hey, I got no intentions
of spending my final days

1:27:18.795 --> 1:27:20.300
in a jail cell.

1:27:20.335 --> 1:27:21.532
I gave you the opportunity, sir.

1:27:21.567 --> 1:27:23.369
He's just, uh,

1:27:23.404 --> 1:27:25.602
he's just trying to
keep everyone safe.

1:27:30.444 --> 1:27:31.839
You really shouldn't
have done that.

1:27:31.874 --> 1:27:34.545
Yeah, and we shouldn't
still be here either.

1:27:37.550 --> 1:27:38.714
Whoa, hold on.

1:27:38.749 --> 1:27:41.651
Ho--Try and stop me.

1:27:41.686 --> 1:27:44.423
Please.

1:27:44.458 --> 1:27:46.755
When were you going to
let me in on all of these

1:27:46.790 --> 1:27:47.723
plan changes?

1:27:47.758 --> 1:27:48.757
Things change, all right?

1:27:48.792 --> 1:27:50.297
What the fuck is going on?

1:27:50.332 --> 1:27:51.023
What the fuck are you doing?

1:27:51.058 --> 1:27:52.299
Just let him go!

1:27:52.334 --> 1:27:54.334
-And implicate us all?
-Implicate?

1:27:54.369 --> 1:27:55.863
We're going to
figure this all out.

1:27:55.898 --> 1:27:58.470
Who the hell do
you think you are?

1:27:58.505 --> 1:28:02.705
How did any of you think
this was going to work?

1:28:11.386 --> 1:28:12.913
Just let go.

1:28:36.070 --> 1:28:39.511
There is no choice,
just the illusion of one.

1:28:39.546 --> 1:28:41.348
It doesn't matter what we do.

1:29:40.805 --> 1:29:42.772
So maybe we get ahead of this.

1:29:46.206 --> 1:29:47.744
What do you have in mind?

1:29:50.980 --> 1:29:55.719
Let's tell our story before
somebody else tells it for us.

1:29:55.754 --> 1:29:58.623
Migrate what needs
to be migrated,

1:29:58.658 --> 1:30:01.560
get ahead of the market since

1:30:01.595 --> 1:30:03.727
we'll obviously take a dip.

1:30:51.711 --> 1:30:53.106
All of you are victims

1:30:53.141 --> 1:30:55.878
of the most corrupt
bank in history.

1:30:55.913 --> 1:30:57.550
Today is your bailout.
