What do you want to know? Um...

00:36.701 --> 00:40.868
See that? A clock, calculator in one. So...

00:40.934 --> 00:42.701
That's free. Thank you.

00:45.968 --> 00:47.467
Oh, here we go.

00:48.434 --> 00:50.734
-(ANSWER MACHINE BEEPS) -Three.

00:50.801 --> 00:52.434
Hello, David, it's Paul Shepherd here. Can you give us a call, mate? Cheers.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.868
No!

00:54.934 --> 00:57.334
Dave, it's Julian. Can you give us a ring, please?

00:57.400 --> 00:59.267
-Go away! -(ANSWER MACHINE BEEPS)

00:59.334 --> 01:00.901
Good bloke. Good laugh.

01:01.100 --> 01:05.100
-David, it's Paul again, I think... -Leave me alone!

(MESSAGE CONTINUES, INDISTINCT)

01:09.367 --> 01:11.267
It's fine. It is fine, that one.

01:11.334 --> 01:13.167
That's okay. It doesn't matter.

01:13.234 --> 01:15.067
Take that there...

01:15.133 --> 01:17.601
That's the old office. So...

01:17.667 --> 01:20.067
Let's get you started. Ohh.

01:22.567 --> 01:25.434
No one is going to lose their jobs.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.133
Yes, Head Office are talking of downsizing,

01:28.200 --> 01:30.133
but they've said clearly

01:30.200 --> 01:33.701
that the most efficient branch will incorporate the other one.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.500
We are the most efficient branch.

01:35.567 --> 01:38.767
Cogito, ergo sum, we'll be fine.

01:38.834 --> 01:41.500
DAVID: Why should they be worried, yeah?

01:41.567 --> 01:43.634
They trust me implicitly.

01:43.701 --> 01:46.200
I've said there's not going to be any redundancies, so that becomes gospel.

01:46.267 --> 01:49.200
Unconditional trust. It's nice.

01:49.267 --> 01:50.934
Mutual. Likewise. Reciprocated.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.701
My only worry is that the powers that be don't come down here

01:54.767 --> 01:57.901
and pop their head round the door with their rule book

01:57.968 --> 02:00.767
and go, "Oh, hold on, what's going on here?

02:00.834 --> 02:02.801
"These people are mucking around." Right?

02:02.868 --> 02:05.968
"Whilst getting the job done, they're having a laugh at work

02:06.033 --> 02:08.534
"with the Sword of Damocles hanging over them." Right?

02:08.601 --> 02:10.934
"This isn't in the rule book. Who's in charge here?"

02:11.000 --> 02:13.133
Guilty! Get a new rule book!

02:13.200 --> 02:14.868
All right?

02:14.934 --> 02:16.167
It works with the turtle.

02:17.934 --> 02:20.000
Okay. Good. Um...

02:22.534 --> 02:24.300
DONNA: Hello. ALL: Hello.

02:24.367 --> 02:27.100
Daughter of my best friends Ron and Elaine.

02:27.167 --> 02:30.133
She's lodging with me, so she's my responsibility,

02:30.200 --> 02:33.567
and her dad's not only a copper but he's a bloody big bugger, isn't he?

02:33.634 --> 02:35.667
So, hands off.

02:35.734 --> 02:37.767
I've got something she could take down in evidence!

02:37.834 --> 02:39.267
Oh, don't worry about this lot.

02:39.334 --> 02:41.534
Do you want to receive some swollen goods?

02:41.601 --> 02:42.734
(ALL LAUGH)

02:42.801 --> 02:44.601
Wouldn't mind escaping up her tunnel!

02:44.667 --> 02:45.901
Get out.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.934
Get out. I mean it.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.467
(SIGHS)

02:58.901 --> 02:59.968
It's a shame.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.567
I will not have her tunnel

03:10.634 --> 03:14.100
bandied around this office willy-nilly.

03:18.801 --> 03:19.767
Right.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.968
Okay. Help her to settle in.

03:25.033 --> 03:27.234
If you do have any trouble from the men...

03:27.300 --> 03:30.200
-What does she do, Dawn? -Kick them in the balls.

03:30.267 --> 03:32.667
-Oh! Feminist. -Get your bra off.

03:32.734 --> 03:33.868
Do you want to go out as well?

03:33.934 --> 03:35.901
Sorry. Burn your bra but... Feminists.

03:35.968 --> 03:37.834
-Good point. -Yeah. Right.

03:37.901 --> 03:39.868
Obviously keep a T-shirt on, like Charlie Dimmock.

03:39.934 --> 03:41.167
-Okay. -Women's libbers.

03:41.234 --> 03:42.534
That's it.

04:13.934 --> 04:17.701

Hello. Wernham Hogg.

04:22.901 --> 04:24.801
Yeah, hang on a minute. I'll just put you through.

04:24.868 --> 04:27.467
That is... You won't need to use that.

04:28.767 --> 04:31.500
You've met this lot. Um, this is Gareth,

04:31.567 --> 04:33.834
who you saw in the meeting.

04:33.901 --> 04:36.200
Formal introductions.

04:36.267 --> 04:37.934
Hi. Gareth. Welcome.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.701
Just a handshake is fine.

04:39.767 --> 04:43.033
-And Ricky. -Hi. Nice to meet you.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.334
Even longer.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.868
And Tim.

04:45.934 --> 04:47.901
-Hello. -Good.

04:47.968 --> 04:51.734
Okay. Settle her in. Get her started. Show her the phones and everything.

04:51.801 --> 04:54.234
But first, methink the lady dost need a chair.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.968
To sit down on.

04:57.033 --> 04:58.701
Maybe she should sit down here

04:58.767 --> 05:01.100
then I could teach her the ropes,

05:01.167 --> 05:04.234
seeing that's my responsibility as team leader.

05:04.300 --> 05:07.634
David? I'm just saying, maybe...

05:07.701 --> 05:10.000
When people say,

05:10.067 --> 05:13.901
"Oh, would you rather be thought of as a funny man or a great boss?"

05:13.968 --> 05:16.968
My answer's always the same. To me, they're not mutually exclusive.

05:17.033 --> 05:21.200
There's a weight of intellect behind my comedy. Yeah?

05:21.267 --> 05:23.667
If you were to ask me to name three geniuses,

05:23.734 --> 05:28.334
I probably wouldn't say, um, Einstein, Newton...

05:28.400 --> 05:31.667
You know. I'd go Milligan, Cleese, Everett.

05:32.634 --> 05:33.868
Sessions.

Can you swap places with Donna, please?

05:47.901 --> 05:50.434
No... I'm not moving.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.100
Do as you're told.

05:52.167 --> 05:55.167
Why, what are you going to do, phone me?

05:55.234 --> 05:57.968
-I am team leader. -I don't give a monkey's.

05:58.033 --> 05:59.567
You're so immature.

05:59.634 --> 06:03.901
Gareth, if there's one thing that I am not, it is immature.

-Gun holster. -It's just my portable telephone.

Sorry, I just thought of something.

(IMITATING CLINT EASTWOOD) I know what you're thinking,

06:30.634 --> 06:32.734
did I make five or six calls?

-Clint Eastwood. -Spot on.

(GASPS) No.

07:15.434 --> 07:19.200
No, it's not... Yeah. It's not funny because

07:19.267 --> 07:21.534
Donna should not have to see me

07:21.601 --> 07:23.934
as a woman with two men doing that all over me.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.067
You've got nice boobs.

07:26.133 --> 07:28.767

You haven't even got email, Joan.

Who printed this out for Joan?

07:50.567 --> 07:53.167
Wow. I'm angry.

07:53.234 --> 07:56.000
And not because I'm in it,

07:56.067 --> 07:59.500
but because it degrades women,

07:59.567 --> 08:01.868
which I hate.

08:01.934 --> 08:05.434
And the culprit, whoever he is, is in this room.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.200
Or she. It could be a woman.

08:07.267 --> 08:09.133
Women are as filthy as men.

08:09.200 --> 08:11.367
Naming no names. I don't know any.

08:11.434 --> 08:14.701
But women are dirty.

Good friend of mine and a bloody good rep, Chris Finch,

Certainly the cleverest bloke you know, isn't he?

08:26.734 --> 08:28.234
Chris Finch, yeah.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.267
He was in an argument once and he went,

08:30.334 --> 08:32.734
"How can I hate women? My mum's one."

08:36.367 --> 08:37.968
Yeah? There's a lot of truth in that.

08:38.033 --> 08:42.300
And that's why when I see rubbish, all right?

08:42.367 --> 08:45.167
I'm not annoyed 'cause I'm in it or I'm a prude.

08:45.234 --> 08:48.567
-It offends women. -And our mums.

08:48.634 --> 08:52.601
In a way. It's sexist, and I hate that.

-So do I. -Yeah, but I've said it, haven't I?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.667
We've both said it. We've had meetings where we've both said it.

-Yeah, but I really hate it. -I've always...

-Bad. -Well, it's not for us to say.

It takes a little while.

"Dutch girls must be punished for having big boobs."

09:30.734 --> 09:32.167
Now, you do not punish someone,

09:32.234 --> 09:34.634
Dutch or otherwise, for having big boobs.

09:34.701 --> 09:36.100
If anything, they should be rewarded.

-They should be equal. -Women are equal.

An office.

11:00.834 --> 11:02.601
Well, use the meeting room for now.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.901
Right. I can say it's my office, can I?

11:04.968 --> 11:06.367
What?

11:06.434 --> 11:08.801
I can say to people, "Come into my office"?

11:08.868 --> 11:12.067
-Well, while you're doing this, yeah. -Right.

11:12.133 --> 11:15.434
-I'll make a sign. -You don't need to make a sign.

it's the meeting room again, so...

He's teamed up with West Ham football team, apparently.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.067
Doing I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles!

12:12.868 --> 12:14.434
The chimp.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.434
She doesn't know about football. Tell her later.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.000
Have you heard George Michael's latest release?

12:21.067 --> 12:24.467
No. George Michael's latest song. It's his release...

12:24.534 --> 12:26.000
-Is it about blow jobs? -Yeah, the thing in the toilet,

12:26.067 --> 12:27.300
-it was a hand job. -Right

12:27.367 --> 12:28.934
DONNA: Is it Wank Me Off Before You Go Go?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.500
(ALL LAUGHING)

12:32.534 --> 12:34.167
Um...

12:35.400 --> 12:38.133
What's white and slides down toilet walls?

12:38.200 --> 12:40.100
-I don't know. -Michael Jackson's latest release.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.400
George Michael's.

12:43.634 --> 12:45.434
Good, innit? Oh.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.200
-Can you moonwalk? -Probably not any more.

12:48.267 --> 12:50.100
-Give it a go? -Yeah. I used to...

12:50.167 --> 12:51.167
You got to drop your heels back.

12:51.234 --> 12:52.801
Not on this. You can't do it on this.

12:52.868 --> 12:54.734
-Let me show you. -I used to do it, yeah.

12:54.801 --> 12:58.801
Oh, yeah, I know how to do it. We used to do all that stuff as well.

12:58.868 --> 13:02.834
All that sort of stuff, yeah. Just like take control of the body.

13:02.901 --> 13:04.467
-And it's all that now, isn't it? -Yeah, and it's all...

13:04.534 --> 13:06.667
-Busy? -Yeah, just, uh...

13:06.734 --> 13:07.934
keeping up the morale.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
-Can we have a chat? -Yeah.

13:13.033 --> 13:14.801
Ooh!

13:17.767 --> 13:19.901
Keith, Keith, Keith, Keith, Keith...

13:19.968 --> 13:21.934
Thanks for coming in. Um...

13:22.133 --> 13:25.834
Now, you know what this is about. Obviously you've seen the picture,

13:25.901 --> 13:27.901
-you know, of David on the computer... -I saw it, I saw it.

13:27.968 --> 13:30.267
Yeah. And we've all had a bit of a laugh about it, haven't we?

13:30.334 --> 13:32.534
-It was funny. -Yeah.

13:32.601 --> 13:35.868
There's a time when the joking has to stop, though. Um...

13:35.934 --> 13:38.067
Not only is it derogatory...

13:38.133 --> 13:41.500
GARETH: David has trusted me with this because

13:41.567 --> 13:43.734
not only have I got people skills,

13:43.801 --> 13:47.534
but I am trained in covert operations.

13:47.601 --> 13:51.500
You know the phrase "softly softly catchee monkey"?

13:51.567 --> 13:54.567
I could catch a monkey. If I was starving, I could.

13:54.634 --> 13:58.601
I'd make poison darts out of the poison off of deadly frogs.

13:58.667 --> 14:03.467
One milligram of that poison can kill a monkey, or a man.

14:03.534 --> 14:06.000
Prick yourself, you'll be dead within a day.

14:06.067 --> 14:07.267
Or longer.

14:07.334 --> 14:09.434
Different frogs, different times.

14:09.500 --> 14:12.334
Do you know who done the picture?

14:12.400 --> 14:13.634
Yeah.

14:13.701 --> 14:16.767
No. I mean, no.

14:16.834 --> 14:20.167
Right. Your first answer was "yeah".

14:20.234 --> 14:22.601
-Wasn't it? -I meant no.

14:22.667 --> 14:26.334
-Well, why did you get... -Uh... Don't know.

14:26.400 --> 14:28.033
Am I making you nervous?

14:28.100 --> 14:30.033
No. I mean, yeah.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.767
Hmm, that's interesting.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.133
I've just spent two days in Swindon with Neil

14:35.200 --> 14:37.033
and he's made some big changes.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.701
Now, when we spoke on Friday,

14:38.767 --> 14:41.167
you said you were going to instigate some changes of your own.

14:41.234 --> 14:44.167
I just wondered how that was going.

14:44.234 --> 14:46.400
-Great. -Good. What have you done?

14:48.167 --> 14:49.801
Changed many things, really.

14:49.868 --> 14:51.500
In a global sense,

14:51.567 --> 14:54.901
streamlining the whole ongoing enterprise of it.

14:54.968 --> 14:57.300
I'm sorry, David, that sounds like management-speak to me,

14:57.367 --> 15:00.167
-and I know you hate that. -Yeah, I do. So...

15:00.234 --> 15:01.767
Well, can you give me, let's say,

15:01.834 --> 15:04.200
five practical changes that you've actually made?

15:04.267 --> 15:06.801
-Five changes? -Mmm.

15:06.868 --> 15:09.734
I'll give you three, and then another two if you need them.

15:09.801 --> 15:10.868
Okay.

15:12.267 --> 15:15.968
Efficiency. Turnover. Profitability.

15:16.033 --> 15:18.334
I'm sorry, David, that still sounds like management-speak.

15:18.400 --> 15:21.701
-No, because... -You hate that.

15:21.767 --> 15:24.901
-Shall I tell you what Neil's done? -Can do.

15:24.968 --> 15:26.467
He's frozen any wage increases,

15:26.534 --> 15:28.367
he's put a stop on all overtime.

15:28.434 --> 15:31.767
And any purchases of £100 or more now go through him.

15:31.834 --> 15:35.367
Hundred? I was going to make it 90, but 100's all right.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.167
And he has started making redundancies, David.

15:38.234 --> 15:39.701
-That's only four. -Yeah. Whatever, David.

15:39.767 --> 15:41.734
Have you made any redundancies?

15:41.801 --> 15:44.734
I gave a speech only this morning to my staff,

15:44.801 --> 15:46.834
assuring them there would not be cutbacks in this branch

15:46.901 --> 15:48.767
and that there certainly wouldn't be redundancies, so...

15:48.834 --> 15:52.133
-Why on earth would you do that? -Why? Oh, don't know.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.334
A little word that I think is important in management called "morale".

15:55.400 --> 15:57.934
Well, surely it's going to be worse for morale in the long run

15:58.000 --> 16:00.901
when there are redundancies and you've told people there won't be?

16:05.434 --> 16:07.634
They won't remember.

16:09.067 --> 16:10.968
-With your arms... -This way?

16:11.033 --> 16:12.467
-Ah! -And then...

16:12.534 --> 16:15.133
-Ooh! Yeah, I know. Like a... -More of a...

16:15.200 --> 16:17.834
DONNA: Yeah. RICKY: That is nice.

16:17.901 --> 16:20.400
I'll be honest with you, David, there have got to be cutbacks.

16:20.467 --> 16:21.767
Now, if you can't manage that yourself,

16:21.834 --> 16:23.868
that's why I'm your boss, I can do that for you.

16:23.934 --> 16:26.334
You're not the boss here. And you don't have to do anything for me

16:26.400 --> 16:27.767
'cause I've already made cutbacks.

16:27.834 --> 16:29.734
-What, you've made cutbacks already? -Yeah.

16:29.801 --> 16:31.734
I didn't want to tell the staff, but to you...

16:31.801 --> 16:34.400
Cutbacks where?

16:34.467 --> 16:35.968
Staff.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.734
-So there have been redundancies? -Yeah.

16:38.801 --> 16:41.367
-Well, have you let anyone go? -Yeah.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.467
Who?

16:43.534 --> 16:45.200
Julie.

16:45.267 --> 16:47.300
Where does Julie work?

16:48.901 --> 16:50.868
Warehouse.

16:50.934 --> 16:53.067
What does she do?

16:53.133 --> 16:56.868
Just general warehouse in the warehouse. She was, uh...

16:56.934 --> 16:59.133
I'm sorry, David, I thought I knew everyone in the warehouse.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.801
What's her surname?

17:01.767 --> 17:03.734
Second name?

17:05.200 --> 17:07.000
Anderton.

17:07.067 --> 17:11.901
Um... It's signs that Gareth's made for the door of his office.

17:11.968 --> 17:15.634
He started off with "interrogation room".

17:15.701 --> 17:17.801
He went to "interrogation office",

17:17.868 --> 17:19.634
"investigation room",

17:19.701 --> 17:22.033
"investigation office", just for the...

17:22.100 --> 17:23.334
He really lost it here.

17:23.400 --> 17:26.868
"Quiet, please! Investigation in process!"

17:29.100 --> 17:32.868
"Silence. Interrogation." That's frightening.

17:32.934 --> 17:35.968
That's the one he's gone for. "Investigation and meeting room."

17:36.033 --> 17:40.133
Makes sense. My personal favourite, though, has to be...

17:40.200 --> 17:43.167
"Gareth Keenan investigates!" Why?

17:43.801 --> 17:45.334
So...

17:45.400 --> 17:47.434
There's a lot of um...

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
-I'm trying to work in here. -Sorry, mate, yeah.

17:49.567 --> 17:52.467
-How is the investigation going? -Good.

17:52.534 --> 17:55.434
-Very good. -Do you need a deputy at all?

17:55.500 --> 17:58.467
No. I've already got one.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.701
-All right, Sheila? -All right?

18:03.634 --> 18:05.801
Keep it down.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.968
This is scary, David.

18:16.033 --> 18:19.000
Don't tie any more cash up in stock unless you have to.

18:19.067 --> 18:23.868
I'm sure you could lose more people from down here. Who's the foreman?

18:23.934 --> 18:25.767
Taffy!

18:25.834 --> 18:27.801
Taffy! (GIGGLES)

18:27.868 --> 18:29.734
-Glynn! -What?

18:30.767 --> 18:32.834
We all call him Taffy.

18:32.901 --> 18:36.167
The thing is, though, no one's dispensable in my book. Yeah?

18:36.234 --> 18:38.767
'Cause we're like one big organism, one big animal.

18:38.834 --> 18:42.100
Yeah? The guys upstairs on the phone, they're the mouth.

18:42.167 --> 18:44.267
And the guys down here, the hands.

18:44.334 --> 18:46.701
-Mmm. And what part are you? -Good question.

18:46.767 --> 18:48.567
Probably the humour.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.100
With responsibility comes harsh things.

18:59.167 --> 19:04.300
Um... People look at me, they say, "Oh, he's tough. He was in the army.

19:04.367 --> 19:07.901
"He's going to be hard. By the book."

19:07.968 --> 19:09.834
But...

19:09.901 --> 19:12.500
I am caring and sensitive.

19:13.801 --> 19:16.200
Isn't Schindler's List a brilliant film?

19:16.834 --> 19:19.500
Um, yeah.

19:19.567 --> 19:22.534
See? People think a strong man can't be sensitive

19:22.601 --> 19:25.100
but I'm thoughtful and caring...

19:25.167 --> 19:26.934
Sorry, what's this about?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.267
About the picture of David with the two blokes jizzing on him.

19:30.334 --> 19:32.200
Were they both jizzing on him?

19:32.267 --> 19:34.801
I thought he was sucking one of them off.

19:34.868 --> 19:37.000
I don't think...

19:38.267 --> 19:40.868
No, look, it's just jizzing.

19:40.934 --> 19:42.500
Well, I didn't do it.

19:42.567 --> 19:44.834
Good. Fine.

19:44.901 --> 19:47.467
Well, I'm glad we had this little chat.

19:47.534 --> 19:51.300
I don't want you to think of me as your boss.

19:51.367 --> 19:52.701
Well, you're not.

19:52.767 --> 19:55.500
Well, I'm higher up than you, so I am.

19:55.567 --> 19:59.300
What I'm saying is don't think of me as a boss,

19:59.367 --> 20:02.701
-but know that I am. -I don't think you are.

20:02.767 --> 20:05.567
Well, I'm team leader, so I am. I'm higher up than you.

20:05.634 --> 20:07.934
(MOBILE RINGS)

20:09.667 --> 20:11.334
Gareth Keenan.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.367
Right, seriously. Now, just stop it.

20:18.367 --> 20:21.000
Yes, I've had office romances.

20:21.067 --> 20:22.601
Loads.

20:22.667 --> 20:24.534
Not here, another place I worked at.

20:24.601 --> 20:26.534
Good-looking ones as well.

20:26.601 --> 20:30.234
But they're not a good idea, office romances.

20:30.300 --> 20:32.701
It's like shitting on your own doorstep.

20:32.767 --> 20:35.467
I've had loads of offers here, but I go, "No way."

20:35.534 --> 20:38.701
Distracting. And that's actually one of the major arguments

20:38.767 --> 20:40.868
against letting gay men into the army.

20:40.934 --> 20:42.834
And I haven't got a problem with that.

20:42.901 --> 20:45.601
You know, a gay man's not going to put me off. I can handle myself.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.033
But if we were in battle,

20:48.100 --> 20:50.767
is he going to be looking at the enemy or looking at me

20:50.834 --> 20:53.100
going, "Oooh"?

20:53.167 --> 20:57.500
You know? "He looks tasty in his uniform."

20:57.567 --> 20:59.000
And I'm not homophobic, all right?

20:59.067 --> 21:00.634
Come round, look at my CD collection.

21:00.701 --> 21:04.601
You'll find Queen, George Michael, Pet Shop Boys.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.434
They're all bummers.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.934
(DOG BARKS ON TV)

21:11.133 --> 21:14.267
All right, lads? What are you watching?

21:14.334 --> 21:17.334
-It's my dog shagging his dog. -Oh, yeah.

21:17.400 --> 21:20.701
Glynn, I'm sure David's made it clear to you that you'll be losing personnel.

21:20.767 --> 21:23.367
That's a funny bit. Look at Gazza's face!

21:24.200 --> 21:25.968
I'm sorry to interrupt,

21:26.033 --> 21:27.701
do you think you can lose any more staff from down here?

21:27.767 --> 21:29.901
-I know you lost Julie Anderton. -Who?

21:29.968 --> 21:32.534
-Opening a can of worms there. -Julie Anderton. David fired her?

21:32.601 --> 21:34.367
-Never heard of her. -Oh, loyalty.

21:34.434 --> 21:36.934
When someone goes from this organisation, they no longer exist.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.167
She never existed, did she?

21:38.234 --> 21:40.434
-Well... -You made her up.

21:40.500 --> 21:42.434
Well, you backed me into a corner and I...

21:42.500 --> 21:44.834
-You lied. -It's a form of acting.

21:44.901 --> 21:46.767
Can you take this upstairs? We're a bit busy.

21:46.834 --> 21:49.534
-You don't look busy. -Do you want me to get busy, love?

21:49.601 --> 21:51.000
I'm sorry?

21:51.067 --> 21:52.934
You can be next. Gazza likes some posh.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.133
-A word with you. Now. -Yep.

21:57.033 --> 21:58.234
That was out of order in a way.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.167
-Ooh! -No, I'm not in trouble.

22:00.234 --> 22:02.400
What she needs is a good shagging!

22:02.601 --> 22:05.667
I might bloody have to now. See you later.

22:07.167 --> 22:09.901
Now, then. You two.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.100
Dawn and Tim.

22:13.167 --> 22:15.400
What do you want, Gareth?

22:15.467 --> 22:18.834
I've been assigned to find out who did the picture.

22:18.901 --> 22:20.267
Right. Who was it?

22:20.334 --> 22:22.400
-Well, I don't know. -Will you get fired?

22:22.467 --> 22:23.934
-Will I get fired? -If you don't know who did it.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.667
Well, I'm finding out now. I'm doing investigations now.

22:26.734 --> 22:29.567
-Was it one of you two? -Yes. Christ, you're good.

22:29.634 --> 22:31.033
-Was it? -No!

22:31.100 --> 22:32.734
I knew it wasn't.

22:32.801 --> 22:35.000
Listen. I'm not going to fire you if you know anything

22:35.067 --> 22:36.500
-because... -You couldn't.

22:36.567 --> 22:37.968
-I could. -How would that work?

22:38.033 --> 22:40.467
I would say, "You're fired. Clear your desk and..."

22:40.534 --> 22:41.934
I would say, "You don't have the authority." But go on.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.367
Not true, not true.

22:43.434 --> 22:45.934
Because in this room, I have special...

22:46.000 --> 22:48.133
-Needs? -No. I am a special...

22:48.200 --> 22:51.167
-Needs child? -No, and that's not funny. All right?

22:51.234 --> 22:53.367
-I won't have you fired because... -You couldn't.

22:53.434 --> 22:54.667
-Right, that's all. -Thank you.

23:04.901 --> 23:07.067
I just can't believe their total lack of respect.

23:07.133 --> 23:10.467
Yeah, yeah. Not only did they undermine you in an authoritive sense...

23:10.534 --> 23:12.467
-(KNOCKING) -Come in, Gareth.

23:12.534 --> 23:14.701
...but they left an image in my mind

23:14.767 --> 23:17.300
of you naked on all fours

23:17.367 --> 23:20.467
being quite literally done doggie-style.

23:20.534 --> 23:22.634
David!

23:24.033 --> 23:26.200
-Carry on. -What is it?

23:26.267 --> 23:27.901
I've found the guilty man.

23:27.968 --> 23:30.701
-Have you indeed, Mr Keenan? -Can this wait, David?

23:30.767 --> 23:32.934
Uh, yeah,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.734
but if I tell you there's pornography, sexist pornography, which I hate,

23:35.801 --> 23:37.834
going round the office, then do you want it to wait?

23:37.901 --> 23:39.500
Pornography?

23:39.567 --> 23:43.200
-Who was it? -Surprise, surprise. It was Tim.

23:43.267 --> 23:45.367
Shame. Good man. How can you be sure?

23:45.434 --> 23:48.767
I found these pictures on his hard drive downloaded from the internet.

23:48.834 --> 23:50.133
After investigation,

23:50.200 --> 23:53.767
licensed by, carried out by...

23:54.534 --> 23:56.767
Oh, no.

23:56.834 --> 24:00.434
Urgh. I don't want you to see this. I don't want to see this. Urgh.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.033
That's worse than the one before.

24:03.100 --> 24:06.400
Oh, I hope there aren't any more. There are more.

24:06.467 --> 24:08.934
Well, he will have to be disciplined

24:09.000 --> 24:11.901
because when the disciplining has to be done,

24:11.968 --> 24:15.167
then the laughter stops for that amount of time, then continues,

24:15.234 --> 24:17.801
rehabilitation notwithstanding.

24:17.868 --> 24:20.100
It's everywhere. Oh.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.934
How did you find out?

24:22.000 --> 24:24.200
Well, I suspected the pictures probably came off the internet,

24:24.267 --> 24:25.901
so I checked everyone's computer.

24:26.100 --> 24:29.033
'Cause there is a log of every web page you've visited.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.767
You just go to Internet Page and then Net History.

24:31.834 --> 24:35.133
-Well, it's not worth it... -It only takes a second.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.701
I don't want to even know how it's done, in a way.

24:37.767 --> 24:41.667
Can you delete the history thing on the computer? We should, really.

24:41.734 --> 24:44.467
-David, this is a meeting. -Yeah, yeah.

24:44.534 --> 24:47.334
Okay. That's all. Anything else?

24:47.400 --> 24:49.167
Um, oh, Taffy phoned from the warehouse.

24:49.234 --> 24:50.934
-He's got another funny video for you. -Thanks.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.300
-This is just one big boys' club! -Not really.

24:53.367 --> 24:56.000
Seedy little men with seedy little jokes.

24:56.067 --> 24:57.801
This morning, perfect example!

24:57.868 --> 24:59.901
I do not want to be put in that position again.

24:59.968 --> 25:02.033
Don't go down the warehouse.

25:02.100 --> 25:04.500
David, don't tell me where I can and can't go in my own company.

25:04.567 --> 25:05.868
-Advice... -You're on very thin ice as it is.

25:05.934 --> 25:09.133
You've already lied to me today. What's that?

25:09.200 --> 25:12.000
You lied to me because you don't have the guts to do your own job.

25:12.067 --> 25:13.601
I don't have the guts?

25:13.667 --> 25:17.767
If you're not man enough to do your job, I will do it for you.

25:17.834 --> 25:19.400
Not man enough?

25:20.534 --> 25:22.534
Okay.

25:22.601 --> 25:24.167
Come here.

25:32.267 --> 25:34.567
Busy at work?

25:34.634 --> 25:37.601
-Is there a problem? -Yeah. That.

25:37.667 --> 25:39.968
-I'm sorry. What's that? -(CHUCKLES) "What's that?"

25:40.033 --> 25:44.500
I don't know. A dirty picture with my head on it, as a sex object.

25:44.567 --> 25:48.868
And don't... You know I like a laugh, Tim. I'm just...

25:48.934 --> 25:52.367
Porno laughs are not funny, okay?

25:52.434 --> 25:55.000
-I'm disappointed. -You think I did this?

25:55.067 --> 25:57.000
Case closed.

25:57.067 --> 25:59.534
Hey, shouldn't I say that? As it was my investigation.

25:59.601 --> 26:02.934
What annoys me is you obviously didn't do it in your own time...

26:03.000 --> 26:05.934
Whoa, whoa. Colombo here figured it out, did he?

26:06.000 --> 26:10.567
Well, yeah, of... I must be guilty if you've got your best man on the case!

26:10.634 --> 26:13.234
Stop trying to be funny for one second, Tim, okay?

26:13.300 --> 26:16.067
And listen, okay? And stop taking advantage of my good nature

26:16.133 --> 26:19.234
'cause I could be like every other boss in this situation.

26:19.300 --> 26:20.667
Okay? Right?

26:20.734 --> 26:24.067
You're taking the piss and I'm getting sick of it.

26:24.133 --> 26:27.567
David, it wasn't me, okay? It was your good friend Chris Finch.

26:29.801 --> 26:31.300
He used my computer.

26:31.367 --> 26:34.000
He said he was your best mate and you'd find it hilarious.

26:34.067 --> 26:36.200
Oh...

26:36.267 --> 26:39.400
No, it is. That was never in question.

26:39.467 --> 26:43.033
I think it's bloody hilarious. You're missing the...

26:43.100 --> 26:45.868
Are you going to apologise to Tim?

26:45.934 --> 26:49.601
I'll tell you about families. You don't have to, in a way.

26:49.667 --> 26:51.033
So...

26:51.100 --> 26:53.334
Are you going to apologise to Tim?

26:53.400 --> 26:55.167
I have, in a way...

26:55.234 --> 26:58.400
-Are you going to apologise now? -Yes!

27:04.868 --> 27:08.601
S... sorry about that.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.801
You weren't involved... You covered for it so well, as well.

27:10.868 --> 27:12.734
You were involved, but you covered, that's what I like.

27:12.801 --> 27:14.534
Well, I really wouldn't want to be here when you bawl out Finchy.

27:14.601 --> 27:16.634
You won't be. It's not fair. Nor will you.

27:16.701 --> 27:19.601
So it's not offensive now it's Chris Finch?

27:19.667 --> 27:23.701
Let's not dwell on whether it is or isn't this or...

27:23.767 --> 27:26.434
Let's stop degrading women, shall we? Please.

27:26.500 --> 27:29.067
Let's have a laugh with them, not at them.

27:29.133 --> 27:31.734
Let's have a laugh at work,

27:31.801 --> 27:34.133
with women, at us.

27:34.200 --> 27:37.500
So I trust you'll be telling Chris Finch he won't be working with us any more?

27:37.567 --> 27:39.167
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll get rid of a good rep

27:39.234 --> 27:40.968
'cause he played a joke. Brilliant.

27:41.033 --> 27:43.434
-David, don't even start. -No, no, fine.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.868
That's come from the top.

27:48.801 --> 27:52.100
Yeah. Hi, Chris. It's David here. Yeah. Bad news, mate.

27:52.167 --> 27:55.133
We're going to have to let you go. We can't use you any more. No. Yep.

27:55.200 --> 27:56.868
'Cause of the joke.

27:56.934 --> 27:59.934
No, I've got a sense of humour, but that was offensive towards women,

28:00.000 --> 28:02.868
and I can't tolerate that. I'll have to pass on...

28:02.934 --> 28:07.601
...the time sponsored by Accurist will be 4:21

28:07.667 --> 28:09.834
and 40 seconds.

28:09.901 --> 28:11.667
-Pathetic. -Is it?

28:11.734 --> 28:14.500
At the third stroke, the time sponsored by Accurist

28:14.567 --> 28:18.601
will be 4:21 and 50 seconds.

28:30.367 --> 28:31.667
Sorry, has anyone got the right time?

28:38.567 --> 28:42.334
# So what becomes of you, my love

28:44.434 --> 28:48.901
# When they have finally stripped you of

28:49.100 --> 28:51.534
# The handbags and the gladrags

28:51.601 --> 28:53.968
# That your granddad had to sweat

28:54.033 --> 28:55.868
# So you could buy #

28:59.300 --> 29:01.267
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.
