00:10.170 --> 00:12.330
Lucky Cat special,
funny-side up.

00:12.330 --> 00:14.120
Aw, it's so cute.

00:14.120 --> 00:15.830
I don't like my breakfast cute.

00:15.830 --> 00:17.920
(whispers)
The eyes,
they follow you.

00:17.920 --> 00:19.330
Um, I think that's
why Fred likes it.

00:19.330 --> 00:22.380
-(clanking)
-Come on! Work! (grunts)

00:22.380 --> 00:23.420
Maybe it's time
to replace it.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.250
I wish I could just buy
a new one,

00:25.250 --> 00:26.500
but they're too expensive.

00:26.500 --> 00:28.500
Remind me never
to mess with her.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.670
(rattles)

00:30.790 --> 00:32.420
There, fixed.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.620
Oh!

00:36.290 --> 00:37.380
Baymax:
I suggest you back away.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.330
Oh! Watch out! Sorry.

00:41.330 --> 00:42.380
(cat yowls)

00:42.380 --> 00:44.460
I will get it.

00:47.170 --> 00:48.420
I have got it.

00:48.420 --> 00:50.620
Uh, well,
maybe I can fix it?

00:50.620 --> 00:51.790
(rattles, hisses)

00:51.790 --> 00:54.540
(thunks)

00:54.540 --> 00:57.210
Can we still call it
a coffee shop
if we don't serve coffee?

00:58.790 --> 01:00.580
Fred's eggs
didn't make it.

01:00.580 --> 01:02.080
Wait.
Where is Fred?

01:02.080 --> 01:04.580
Baymax:
Scan indicates,
Fred is not here.

01:04.580 --> 01:05.750
Should we be
worried?

01:05.750 --> 01:08.460
We could worry
or we could call him.

01:08.460 --> 01:10.920
-(phone rings)
-Or he could call us.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.380
Guys, emergency!

01:12.380 --> 01:13.920
Help now!

01:23.420 --> 01:25.500
(file rasping)

01:27.710 --> 01:30.540
Baymax:
This does not appear
to be an emergency.

If you're lookin'
for someone to cut
your toenails,

02:06.210 --> 02:09.330
the answer is no, never again.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.920
That hangnail was
majorly infected, okay?

02:11.920 --> 02:13.420
A man can't operate on himself.

02:13.420 --> 02:15.250
Freddie, why are we here?

02:15.250 --> 02:18.080
Because it's here.
There's no escape.
There's no hope.

02:18.080 --> 02:19.620
All right.
Drama king,

02:19.620 --> 02:20.880
explanation, now.

02:20.880 --> 02:23.250
It's my bro-tillion.

02:23.250 --> 02:25.580
-What'd he say?
-He's reptilian?

02:25.580 --> 02:27.460
Oh, something
with his costume.

02:27.460 --> 02:29.710
No, Bro. Bro-Bro-Bro.

02:29.710 --> 02:32.000
-Bro. Bro.
-Heathcliff. Translation?

02:32.000 --> 02:35.540
The time has come
for Master Frederick's
bro-tillion,

02:35.540 --> 02:37.830
a grand gala
held in his honor

02:37.830 --> 02:41.620
where he will be
formally presented
to the city's monied elite.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.580
-Fred, translation?
-It's a stuffy party where
I have to stuff myself

02:44.580 --> 02:47.460
into a stuffy suit
and talk to stuffy people
about stuffy things.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.040
And that's not even
the worst part.

02:49.040 --> 02:52.380
And then there's... Binky.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.500
I do not have any data
on... Binky.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.960
Beverly Samantha Mole,

02:57.960 --> 02:59.670
aka, Binky.

02:59.670 --> 03:03.040
The reigning queen
of San Fransokyo's snob society.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.670
She's rude.
She's arrogant.
She's--

03:05.670 --> 03:07.330
Quite insufferable.

03:07.330 --> 03:09.920
Not at all down to earth
like you, madam.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.540
Which is why everything
must be perfect.

03:12.540 --> 03:15.500
-Right, dear?
-Right, Mom.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.750
Why does your mom care
what this Binky lady thinks?

03:17.750 --> 03:20.580
Well... there was the time
I defaced priceless art.

03:20.580 --> 03:23.710
In my defense, the concept
of priceless art was still
new to me.

03:23.710 --> 03:25.420
Binky, wait!

03:25.420 --> 03:26.750
-Then, there was
the monkey incident.
-(monkeys screeching)

03:26.750 --> 03:28.960
In my defense,
the monkeys looked up to me
as their leader.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.580
Binky, wait!

03:31.790 --> 03:33.580
Fred:
And I'm still not allowed
at the yacht club.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.880
In my defense--
Well, I don't really have
a defense for that one.

03:35.880 --> 03:37.250
Binky, wait!

03:37.250 --> 03:39.330
-Wow.
-Yeah, wow.

03:39.330 --> 03:40.880
I can't let my mom down again.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.830
You guys have to help me.
I need to become a proper
young gentledude,

03:43.830 --> 03:45.380
and I need to do it by Saturday.

03:45.380 --> 03:48.120
Saturday?
Which Saturday?
This Saturday?

03:48.120 --> 03:49.620
Okay. We can do this.

03:49.620 --> 03:52.710
You've already taken care
of personal grooming, your mom's
handling wardrobe,

03:52.710 --> 03:56.120
-what's next?
-Preparing for the moment
I fear more than anything...

03:57.170 --> 03:58.750
the dance.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.670
That really wasn't worth
the dramatic pause.

04:00.670 --> 04:01.960
Yeah-huh.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.920
Uh, don't worry, Fred.
I got this.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.710
Ba-da-la-la-la-la.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.540
Allow me to introduce, Baymax.

04:16.540 --> 04:18.210
Now with dance mode.

04:18.210 --> 04:19.210
(gum pops)

04:20.380 --> 04:22.790
Five, six, seven, eight.

04:25.750 --> 04:27.500
(bright music playing)

04:31.710 --> 04:34.750
(Irish music playing)

04:34.750 --> 04:36.790
-(disco music playing)
-Huh?

04:36.790 --> 04:38.830
(hip-hop music playing)

04:42.790 --> 04:44.880
The Robot. Really?

04:44.880 --> 04:46.580
Baymax:
The waltz.

04:46.580 --> 04:49.710
Your arms go here and here.

04:49.710 --> 04:51.290
Well, this is kind of nice.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.670
-I will lead. Ready?
-Ready?

04:53.670 --> 04:55.040
-Step, side.
-Whoa, wait.

04:55.040 --> 04:56.620
-Which side?
-Very good.

04:56.620 --> 04:58.170
-Step, side.
You're movin' real fast.
-Step, side.

04:58.170 --> 04:59.710
-Uh, step, side, close.
-Step...

04:59.710 --> 05:01.790
Terrible news, Frederick.

05:01.790 --> 05:03.710
Avalanche
on the family mountain.

05:03.710 --> 05:06.120
Of course, your father
is leading the search party.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.290
So, my party's off?

05:07.290 --> 05:08.790
Don't even joke about that.

05:08.790 --> 05:11.710
Madam, more terrible news.

05:11.710 --> 05:16.120
-The caterer has canceled.
-What? No! No!

05:16.120 --> 05:18.460
Did you tell him I--
I would pay him obscenely?

05:18.460 --> 05:20.710
-Of course.
-Oh, this cannot be happening.

05:20.710 --> 05:22.500
Come, Heathcliff, we have
to find another caterer

05:22.500 --> 05:23.920
or the bro-tillion
will be ruined.

05:23.920 --> 05:25.710
I'll be ruined!

05:25.710 --> 05:27.330
Mm... Be right back.

05:27.330 --> 05:30.620
This is a disaster.
All the best caterers
are committed.

05:30.620 --> 05:33.290
What am I going to do?
No canapes, no crudites.

05:33.290 --> 05:35.710
(gasps) Oh, Binky's going
to have a field day.

05:35.710 --> 05:39.670
Maybe not.
You know, it just so happens
I know of a hot new caterer.

05:39.670 --> 05:41.500
-You do?
-Oh, yeah.

05:41.500 --> 05:42.790
Totally undiscovered gem.

05:42.790 --> 05:44.620
Does this undiscovered gem
have references?

05:44.620 --> 05:47.500
References?
You mean, living
in the past?

05:47.500 --> 05:52.710
Look, she's not some
stuffy old caterer making
the same stuffy old stuff.

05:52.710 --> 05:54.790
She's exciting.
She's hip.

05:54.790 --> 05:57.040
You'd be
on the cutting edge.

05:57.040 --> 05:58.920
Me, on the cutting edge?

05:58.920 --> 06:01.750
Oh, that would make
Binky's blue blood boil.

06:01.750 --> 06:04.500
Hiro, you are a lifesaver.

06:04.500 --> 06:06.620
-(phone beeping)
-Guess what, Aunt Cass?

06:06.620 --> 06:08.670
You're gonna be able to buy
that new espresso machine.

06:08.670 --> 06:11.120
You have done catering
before, right?

06:11.120 --> 06:14.420
(waltz music playing)

06:14.420 --> 06:16.330
It's hopeless.
I can't do it.

06:16.330 --> 06:17.880
You know who else
thinks you can't do it?

06:17.880 --> 06:18.920
Binky Mole.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.250
Are you gonna let her
be right?

06:20.250 --> 06:22.250
Or are you gonna be
on the cutting edge?

06:22.250 --> 06:23.540
On the cutting edge of what?

06:23.540 --> 06:25.040
I don't know.
It worked on your mom.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.330
The point is, you're going
out there on Saturday

06:27.330 --> 06:28.960
to show Binky Mole
what you're made of--

06:28.960 --> 06:30.960
that you're Frederick
Frederickson the Fourth

06:30.960 --> 06:32.330
and you're not afraid
of anything.

06:32.330 --> 06:34.920
Well, spiders, a little.
I mean, not debilitating.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.500
Hiro:
Fred.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.880
Oh, okay.
Get over here,
Mr. Marshmallow.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.380
We gonna waltz now.

06:41.380 --> 06:42.420
Oh!

06:44.750 --> 06:48.250
(stately piano music playing)

06:51.420 --> 06:56.500
Ooh, look. A panda.
Look at his little face,
isn't he cute?

06:56.500 --> 06:57.880
I named him Parker.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.830
And that kitten over there?
That's Rodrigo.

06:59.830 --> 07:00.920
Isn't he adorable?

07:00.920 --> 07:02.920
Honey Lemon, don't get
emotionally involved

07:02.920 --> 07:03.880
with the hors d'oeuvres.

07:03.880 --> 07:05.920
Okay, guys.
Get out there and circulate.

07:05.920 --> 07:07.080
Leave no mouth unappetized,

07:07.080 --> 07:08.790
no hand unbeveraged,

07:08.790 --> 07:10.790
and most importantly,
have fun.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.620
(breathes deeply)

07:15.620 --> 07:18.830
Uh, excuse me! Coming through!

07:18.830 --> 07:20.880
(chattering)

07:23.420 --> 07:25.210
Can I interest you
in a cute panda?

07:25.210 --> 07:27.620
Or perhaps
an adorable kitten?

07:27.620 --> 07:30.120
-(crunching)
-Parker...

07:30.120 --> 07:32.460
-Told you.
-Ah! Huh?

07:33.750 --> 07:37.330
(sputtering, hissing)

07:38.830 --> 07:40.880
(reinflating)

07:43.750 --> 07:46.290
Up-up-up.
Don't forget a napkin.

07:47.620 --> 07:48.750
You're welcome.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.920
Hello.
I am Baymax.

07:53.120 --> 07:55.120
Your recent rhinoplasty

07:55.120 --> 07:58.750
is approximately
73.9 percent healed.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.830
I thought you said
it wasn't obvious.

08:00.830 --> 08:04.330
Good evening, all.
Thank you for coming.

08:04.330 --> 08:07.250
It is with great pride
that I introduce

08:07.250 --> 08:11.210
the bro of the hour,
my son, Frederick.

08:11.210 --> 08:14.830
-(applause)
-(piano music playing)

08:14.830 --> 08:16.330
Fred:
Binky.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.710
-Baymax, help.
-(tray clatters)

08:17.710 --> 08:19.420
I forgot the steps.
My mind is blank.

08:19.420 --> 08:21.000
Everything is swirling
around me.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.210
Your symptoms indicate
acute anxiety.

08:23.210 --> 08:25.920
I recommend
deep calming breaths.

08:25.920 --> 08:28.960
(breathing deeply)

08:28.960 --> 08:31.620
Oh, no.
Now you are
hyperventilating.

08:31.620 --> 08:33.790
Breathe,
into this.

08:33.790 --> 08:36.710
(breathing deeply)

08:36.710 --> 08:38.620
It's not working.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.380
It feels like
the whole room is shaking.

08:40.380 --> 08:42.250
(rattling)

08:42.250 --> 08:46.080
(rumbling, clattering)

08:46.080 --> 08:48.960
-(screaming)
-Guys? What is that?

08:48.960 --> 08:51.000
(steam hisses)

08:52.830 --> 08:55.460
Greetings, San Fransokyo.

08:55.460 --> 08:57.920
It is I,
Baron Von Steamer.

09:01.380 --> 09:05.500
I was a pretty well-known
villain in my day.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.250
No? Steam? Steamer?

09:10.790 --> 09:12.420
Nobody remembers?

09:12.420 --> 09:14.040
Ah, well, I guess
there's not room

09:14.040 --> 09:17.670
in your fancy
pocket-vest telephones
for history.

09:17.670 --> 09:21.080
-(feedback whines)
-This is a private affair, sir,
and you did not RSVP.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.880
I did not RSVP,

09:23.880 --> 09:27.290
and I didn't bring a guest,
but I am taking one--

09:27.290 --> 09:29.880
Frederick Frederickson
the Fourth!

09:29.880 --> 09:32.210
Wait. What? Does this mean
I don't have to dance?

09:33.710 --> 09:36.750
-Help!
-(screaming)

09:38.000 --> 09:39.420
(clattering)

09:39.420 --> 09:42.080
Here you go.
And one for you.
Lucky Cat Catering.

09:42.080 --> 09:43.670
Tell your friends.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.170
Binky, wait.

09:45.170 --> 09:49.250
There's a perfectly good
explanation for all of this,
I think.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.170
Binky, come back!

09:51.170 --> 09:54.460
Wow. A super-villain crashed
my bro-tillion.

09:54.460 --> 09:57.040
Yeah. A super-villain
crashed your bro-tillion.

09:57.040 --> 09:58.000
Protect Fred.

09:59.920 --> 10:00.830
Hiya!

10:02.500 --> 10:04.620
-(steam hissing)
-(laughing maniacally)

10:10.500 --> 10:11.540
Scanning...

10:13.040 --> 10:14.500
Huh?

10:14.500 --> 10:15.960
(grunting)

10:15.960 --> 10:18.080
(gasps)

10:18.080 --> 10:20.620
-(steam hisses)
-Honey Lemon!

10:20.620 --> 10:22.080
-(steam hisses)
-(grunts)

10:23.080 --> 10:24.460
We need our gear.

10:24.460 --> 10:28.460
Baymax:
Steam is hazardous.
It can cause third-degree burns.

10:28.460 --> 10:32.290
That is the ambition
of the weapon, pale dirigible.

10:32.290 --> 10:33.880
(steam hisses)

10:33.880 --> 10:35.170
Baymax:
That is hot.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.540
He melted my face?

10:40.540 --> 10:42.500
A bro should not have to see
his own face melted.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.880
Wasabi:
Don't look at it!

10:48.500 --> 10:49.960
(piano clatters)

10:49.960 --> 10:51.040
(grunts)
Aw, come on!

10:52.580 --> 10:55.000
Ah, young Frederick.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.710
You have grown
since the baby child

10:56.710 --> 10:59.500
you presumably were
at one point.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.460
So, I'm guessing
you two haven't met.

11:01.460 --> 11:02.960
I think I'd remember.

11:04.620 --> 11:08.290
You are the spitting image
of your accursed father.

11:08.290 --> 11:10.000
Whoa. What the--?

11:10.000 --> 11:13.080
Oh! Guys? Help!

11:13.080 --> 11:15.920
-Hiro: Wasabi!
-(Steamer laughing manically)

11:15.920 --> 11:17.120
Let him go!

11:18.790 --> 11:19.920
Hmm?

11:19.920 --> 11:22.620
-I'm not Fred.
-Silence, prisoner!

11:22.620 --> 11:26.120
Tell Boss Awesome
he has until midnight
to surrender

11:26.120 --> 11:30.830
if he ever wants to see
his precious baby child again.

11:30.830 --> 11:33.330
-(laughing maniacally)
-'Kay, not sure which way
your creepy laugh

11:33.330 --> 11:35.920
is coming from.
Could you cackle again, please?

11:35.920 --> 11:36.920
Steamer: No!

11:38.500 --> 11:41.710
-He got Wasabi.
-I think the super-villain
thought he was me.

11:41.710 --> 11:43.290
Super-confused-villain.

11:43.290 --> 11:45.960
I'm also confused.
Who's Boss Awesome?

11:48.500 --> 11:50.670
Your dad was
a superhero?

11:50.670 --> 11:52.290
Named Boss Awesome?

11:52.290 --> 11:53.580
'Twas the '70s.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.080
Fred, you sure
we should be in here?

11:55.080 --> 11:57.580
No, but Dad's halfway
around the world in Switzerstan.

11:57.580 --> 11:59.080
We can keep a secret.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.330
(clears throat)
I'm glad somebody can.

12:01.330 --> 12:02.540
Uh, hey, Dad.

12:02.540 --> 12:04.000
Hi, Mr. Frederickson.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.750
Do you mind telling me
what you and you friends
are doing

12:06.750 --> 12:09.040
in my secret superhero den?

12:09.040 --> 12:12.250
Well, we're at my bro-tillion,
then this guy Steamer shows up--

12:12.250 --> 12:14.710
-Baron Von Steamer?
-Yeah. That's the one.

12:14.710 --> 12:17.080
I can't believe
he's still in the game.

12:17.080 --> 12:18.790
He was old back in the day.

12:18.790 --> 12:21.080
Well, he's back.
For revenge.

12:21.080 --> 12:24.040
Of course he is.
He was my arch-nemesis.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.880
Sir? He captured our friend.
Any idea where he would
take him?

12:26.880 --> 12:29.170
He had multiple hideouts,
as I recall.

12:29.170 --> 12:31.460
But he did have a couple
of favorites.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.790
Hit that button there.

12:32.790 --> 12:35.000
(beeps, buzzes)

12:35.000 --> 12:37.120
The lights indicate
the locations

12:37.120 --> 12:38.920
of Steamer's old lairs.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.710
Can't be that one.
It's a Noodle Burger now.

12:40.710 --> 12:43.120
Yep, and that's a Noodle Burger,
that's a Noodle Burger,
Noodle Burger,

12:43.120 --> 12:45.120
and another Noodle Burger.
Oh, wait. No, no.
You know what?

12:45.120 --> 12:47.790
-That's a Yaki Taco.
-So the only two
that aren't Noodle Burgers,

12:47.790 --> 12:50.040
the abandoned subway station
and the old ironworks.

12:50.040 --> 12:51.920
They're on opposite sides
of the city.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.170
-Great.
-We'll have to split up.

12:53.170 --> 12:56.170
-Classic.
-(growling)

12:57.750 --> 13:02.500
Finally!
After all these years,
I will get my revenge.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.880
I will best my mortal enemy

13:04.880 --> 13:07.040
by taking the thing
he treasures the most.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.710
(laughs)
His offspring, his heir,

13:09.710 --> 13:11.920
his baby child!

13:11.920 --> 13:17.120
For nigh upon half a century,
your father and I have clashed.

13:17.120 --> 13:20.250
My condolences, baby child.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.830
For tonight,
Boss Awesome will perish.

13:23.830 --> 13:28.040
Look, scary steam guy,
I have no idea who
Boss Awesome is

13:28.040 --> 13:31.080
but I can assure you,
I am not his baby child.

13:31.080 --> 13:36.170
(laughs)
That's exactly what your father
would want you to say.

13:36.170 --> 13:38.500
What? No.
You're not listening to me.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.290
I'm not Fred.
You got the wrong guy.

13:41.290 --> 13:43.120
Save your breath, Frederick.

13:43.120 --> 13:47.380
If your daddy doesn't show,
it could be your last.

13:47.380 --> 13:51.330
My last breath?
No, no, no, no, no.
I have lots of breaths.

13:51.330 --> 13:56.120
Watch.
(inhaling, exhaling)

14:01.290 --> 14:05.080
Steamer:
Salutations, nosy interlopers.

14:05.080 --> 14:11.040
You have made the grievous error
of transgressing on the lair
of Baron Von Steamer.

14:15.380 --> 14:17.500
-(clatters)
-Thanks, Baymax.

14:17.500 --> 14:22.040
Booby-trapped.
Old timey booby-trapped,
but, uh, still, booby-trapped.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.170
I will search
for more booby traps.

14:24.170 --> 14:25.540
Whoa, hold on.

14:25.540 --> 14:27.580
I'm picking up a heat signature.

14:27.580 --> 14:30.620
-Could it be a furnace?
-Do furnaces typically move?

14:30.620 --> 14:32.040
Not typically.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.290
It is moving... toward us.

14:35.830 --> 14:37.670
Rapidly.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.120
It's another booby trap!

14:39.120 --> 14:40.250
Oh, no.

14:41.250 --> 14:42.380
(horn blares)

14:44.500 --> 14:47.290
(horn blaring)

14:47.290 --> 14:48.580
I suggest we leave.

14:52.960 --> 14:55.290
-That was unfortunate.
-Baymax. Power lift.

14:55.290 --> 14:58.210
(horn blaring)

15:03.580 --> 15:06.540
(debris clattering)

15:08.920 --> 15:10.210
Baymax:
You are safe now.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.330
(coughs)
Thanks, Baymax.

15:12.330 --> 15:14.710
Steamer:
Salutations, nosy interlopers.

15:14.710 --> 15:15.920
Where is he?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.920
You have made
the grievous error of--

15:17.920 --> 15:20.960
-(thuds)
-error... error...
error... error...

15:20.960 --> 15:23.000
Baymax:
Baron Von Steamer
is not here.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.170
error... error... error... er--

15:25.170 --> 15:27.080
We need to get
to the old ironworks, fast.

15:33.420 --> 15:35.000
(squeaking)

15:35.000 --> 15:36.580
Well, this place
is disgusting.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.380
Yeah.
Steamer really nailed it.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.000
Honey Lemon:
Guys, look!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.920
It's Rodrigo.
He made it.

15:41.920 --> 15:43.460
Wasabi's leaving us
a trail.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.750
Hmm... hmm...

15:48.750 --> 15:49.750
(crunching)

15:52.330 --> 15:54.830
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you wanna eat this?

15:54.830 --> 15:56.540
(whimpers) Rodrigo.

15:56.540 --> 15:59.580
Steamer:
Boss Awesome thinks
he's so special.

15:59.580 --> 16:02.790
-Boss Awesome
thinks he's the bee's knees.
-Ugh, of course.

16:02.790 --> 16:06.830
Tonight, Baron Von Steamer
is the bee's knees!

16:06.830 --> 16:09.420
-(whimpers)
-(cage creaking)

16:14.460 --> 16:15.580
(grunts)

16:18.880 --> 16:20.460
(beeps)

16:20.460 --> 16:21.500
Ah!

16:21.500 --> 16:23.250
(grunts)
Oh, no.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.460
(shatters)

16:24.460 --> 16:28.380
Oh, yes.
Midnight is nigh,
my captive buffoon,

16:28.380 --> 16:30.380
and your daddy's not here.

16:30.380 --> 16:33.880
I'm not Fred,
and my daddy's
an orthodontist.

16:33.880 --> 16:36.620
Steamer:
Nice try, baby child.

16:36.620 --> 16:40.250
Fire up the ironworks!
(laughing manically)

16:42.290 --> 16:45.920
Aah! No! Up! Stop! Aah!
Well, what if I say I am?

16:45.920 --> 16:48.120
-Fred?
-Super jump!

16:53.460 --> 16:56.120
Aren't you supposed
to be saving me? Aah!

16:56.120 --> 16:59.120
(yelping) Okay! Okay!

17:00.790 --> 17:02.330
(grunts)

17:04.380 --> 17:05.920
You can open your eyes now.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.580
Not ready yet.

17:07.580 --> 17:08.670
(growls)

17:12.880 --> 17:14.500
Millennial!

17:18.040 --> 17:20.460
Uh, did he just give up?

17:20.460 --> 17:21.580
I think we should
get out of here now.

17:21.580 --> 17:24.080
-Could not agree more. Aah!
-(alarm blares)

17:24.080 --> 17:25.960
(Steamer laughing maniacally)

17:28.120 --> 17:29.380
Go Go:
What is that?

17:36.710 --> 17:38.540
Fred:
Hey, guys, I lied.

17:38.540 --> 17:41.040
My fear of spiders
is debilitating.

17:41.040 --> 17:45.420
Where is Boss Awesome?
You're not bosses,
or awesome.

17:45.420 --> 17:46.460
Watch out!

17:49.000 --> 17:51.330
So it's a spider,
with a hammer.

17:51.330 --> 17:53.500
Go Go: I don't see
what this thing... (grunts)

17:53.500 --> 17:55.040
...has to do with steam.

17:55.040 --> 17:58.210
Steamer: Well, you can't tell
from the outside,
but it's steam powered.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.960
I guess we'll have
to take your word for it.
(grunts)

18:04.880 --> 18:07.830
There you are,
baby child Frederick.

18:07.830 --> 18:10.420
Uh, Fred, you wanna
say somethin' right now?

18:10.420 --> 18:13.580
(hyperventilating)

18:13.580 --> 18:15.670
(shattering)

18:15.670 --> 18:17.620
Run, Wasabi!

18:17.620 --> 18:18.750
Aah!

18:20.580 --> 18:21.580
Oh!

18:23.880 --> 18:25.420
-Hiro: Gotcha!
-Huh?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.290
How many of you are there?

18:29.290 --> 18:31.830
Baymax, am I glad
to see you.

18:31.830 --> 18:35.330
Scanning. You are unharmed,
but damp.

18:35.330 --> 18:37.330
Yeah, well, it's hot in here.

18:37.330 --> 18:40.420
And I, uh, maybe...
peed myself a little.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.920
Oh?

18:41.920 --> 18:44.000
That's it. (grunts)

18:50.920 --> 18:52.830
Hiro:
Baymax, look out!

18:52.830 --> 18:54.620
(Baymax grunts)

18:57.620 --> 18:59.830
Hiro, are you injured?

18:59.830 --> 19:02.040
Fred.

19:02.040 --> 19:05.380
Huge spider, so big,
so many legs.

19:06.420 --> 19:09.170
Oh, no. Everybody?

19:09.170 --> 19:12.080
Come on, Fred.
You can do this.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.620
That's it! You wanted
Frederick Frederickson

19:14.620 --> 19:16.580
the Fourth and here I am,

19:16.580 --> 19:18.460
in a lizard costume.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.620
Wait. You're Frederick?

19:20.620 --> 19:24.170
Ah, yes, I see the resemblance.

19:24.170 --> 19:28.460
You scoundrel.
How dare you impersonate
a Frederickson.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.960
Yeah, that's what I was doing.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.500
At last,
I will exact my revenge

19:33.500 --> 19:37.620
by defeating my arch-enemy's
little baby child.

19:37.620 --> 19:39.710
Listen, Steamer.
Today is my bro-tillion.

19:39.710 --> 19:43.790
Today, I'm not a baby child,
I'm a man child.

19:43.790 --> 19:46.500
-(waltz music playing)
-Step! Side!

19:52.790 --> 19:54.580
Huh?

19:54.580 --> 19:55.920
Step! Side!

19:55.920 --> 19:58.040
Steamer:
Hold still, you fidget!

19:59.830 --> 20:02.040
Cease your prancing!

20:03.170 --> 20:06.460
Stop melting my legs!

20:06.460 --> 20:09.920
Step! Side! Waltz! Kaboom!

20:12.040 --> 20:13.580
(waltz music ends)

20:13.580 --> 20:16.670
You crashed
the wrong party, Steamer.

20:16.670 --> 20:18.880
(groans)

20:21.000 --> 20:23.540
Steamer:
It appears you have
bested me, Frederick,

20:23.540 --> 20:26.620
but I will have my revenge.

20:26.620 --> 20:30.120
Villainy defies gravity!

20:30.120 --> 20:32.080
-(thunks)
-(pneumatic hissing)

20:32.080 --> 20:34.210
Eventually!

20:35.500 --> 20:39.380
(music thumping)

20:39.380 --> 20:42.170
Hiro, do you see?
All these are catering jobs.

20:42.170 --> 20:43.500
I'm booked solid!

20:43.500 --> 20:45.080
I love this new
espresso machine.

20:45.080 --> 20:47.580
(rattling)

20:47.580 --> 20:50.000
-(yelps)
-(steam hisses)

20:51.620 --> 20:53.080
See? This is nice.

20:54.210 --> 20:55.380
(gasps)

20:55.380 --> 20:57.540
(sighs)
What's his name?

20:57.540 --> 20:58.790
Sienna.

20:58.790 --> 21:02.380
-(waltz music playing)
-May I have this dance?

21:04.580 --> 21:07.580
Do you think Binky's
havin' a good time?

21:07.580 --> 21:09.960
Your stress level is elevated.

21:09.960 --> 21:12.170
Would you like a hug?

21:12.170 --> 21:14.210
I'm sorry my bro-tillion
got ruined, Mom.

21:14.210 --> 21:16.000
I know how much
you wanted to impress Binky.

21:16.000 --> 21:19.080
Oh, I don't know.
I like this one better.

21:19.080 --> 21:20.500
It's much more you.

21:20.500 --> 21:22.670
Besides, I think it's time
we both stopped worrying

21:22.670 --> 21:24.460
about what Binky thinks.

21:25.710 --> 21:27.620
I'm so proud of you, dear.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.330
Back at you, Madre.

21:32.380 --> 21:35.290
(waltz music ends)

21:37.330 --> 21:39.830
(theme music playing)
