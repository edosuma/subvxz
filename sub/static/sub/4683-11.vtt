WEBVTT

00:21.266 --> 00:23.900
I'll be back. I'm free.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.333
No!

02:21.900 --> 02:22.966
Hello?

02:23.766 --> 02:26.133
Hey, mom. How's Milan?

02:26.200 --> 02:27.500
'Oh, wonderful.'

02:27.566 --> 02:30.233
Great. Hey, guess what?

02:30.300 --> 02:32.800
The coach says he already
got a couple of calls about me.

02:32.866 --> 02:35.633
Well, that's great, honey,
we knew that would happen.

02:35.700 --> 02:36.700
But don't forget
your school work

02:36.766 --> 02:38.333
and please
clean the basement.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.800
'Don't forget to mow the lawn.'

02:39.866 --> 02:42.433
I'll take care of everything,
mom, like I said.

02:42.500 --> 02:44.000
Are you guys gonna be back
for play-offs?

02:44.066 --> 02:45.433
I want you to see me.

02:45.500 --> 02:48.000
Honey, we've already seen you,
we know you're good.

02:48.066 --> 02:50.000
It's the first vacation
I've had in five years.

02:50.066 --> 02:52.866
Your father's still on business
and we're meeting in Greece.

02:52.933 --> 02:55.333
Yeah, but when was the last time
we were all together?

02:55.400 --> 02:57.366
Aren't you sweet?

02:57.433 --> 02:59.300
We miss you too, honey.

02:59.366 --> 03:01.100
Gotta go. Bye, sweetie.

03:01.166 --> 03:02.133
No, mom, wait.

03:05.366 --> 03:06.733
Shit.

03:07.633 --> 03:10.200
Did I come at a bad time?

03:10.266 --> 03:11.566
Hell no.

03:11.633 --> 03:13.733
Every day's a fun day
around this house.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.333
Wait, just a second.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.866
Do you wanna talk about it?

03:20.933 --> 03:23.800
No, it's fine.
Everything's okay.

03:23.866 --> 03:25.933
You're here early. How come?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.300
My mom had another
sleepover guest.

03:28.366 --> 03:30.933
I like to leave before he does.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.600
At least your mom's around

03:32.666 --> 03:34.233
They'll be back soon.

03:34.300 --> 03:37.166
It'll be too late.
It's always too late.

03:37.233 --> 03:39.633
Don't worry about it.
It's not your problem.

03:39.700 --> 03:41.633
Come on, we're gonna be late.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.800
'Alright, now, I wanna see
that trap play work tomorrow.'

03:53.633 --> 03:56.133
Come on, come on, come on.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.500
Move it, Farrell.

03:59.666 --> 04:02.233
Hey...guy walks into a bar

04:02.300 --> 04:04.400
he's got this chicken with him.
He says to the bartender--

04:04.466 --> 04:07.100
Take my wife, please.
I know them all, coach.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.166
You're no Henny Youngman.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.233
Hey, I'm just trying
to give you a sense of humor.

04:11.300 --> 04:13.200
You get to college
with that Joe serious stuff

04:13.266 --> 04:15.233
man, they're gonna
eat you alive.

04:15.300 --> 04:17.100
I'll take my chances.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.233
Do we have to talk now?

04:19.300 --> 04:20.933
Why not?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.300
Hey, John.

04:23.833 --> 04:26.600
John, I just wanna know
what's going on with you.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.633
What do you think?
He's still out there somewhere.

04:29.700 --> 04:32.700
The Springwood "Chopper" with
three deaths in three weeks.

04:32.766 --> 04:34.766
I found the last victim,
remember?

04:35.666 --> 04:36.900
No offence, coach

04:36.966 --> 04:38.800
but I've had all
my counselling from the cops.

04:38.866 --> 04:42.200
But, John, I didn't come here
to talk about that.

04:42.266 --> 04:44.700
Your English teacher says
you're having some problems.

04:46.366 --> 04:47.666
One F.

04:47.733 --> 04:50.133
One lousy F in three years

04:50.200 --> 04:53.366
but the alarms go off
because it's me, Johnny Perfect.

04:53.433 --> 04:54.966
Well, kinda asked for it.

04:57.100 --> 04:59.733
Look, he just wants
to talk to your parents.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.466
Fine. Tell him
to charter a plane

05:01.533 --> 05:03.400
and pack a big lunch.

05:03.466 --> 05:06.233
Alright, alright, alright.
Enough of that for the moment.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.400
You were late for practice today
and that concerns me directly.

05:09.466 --> 05:10.733
You wanna tell me why?

05:12.366 --> 05:15.833
Yeah. Not here. Not now.

05:19.900 --> 05:22.400
Look, are we still on
for tomorrow?

05:22.466 --> 05:24.333
As long as you're not arrested
for murdering

05:24.400 --> 05:25.733
one of the faculty.

05:27.766 --> 05:29.233
It's not funny.

05:32.866 --> 05:34.566
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:35.933 --> 05:38.500
Guy walks into a bar,
he says to the termite..

05:52.066 --> 05:54.000
Are you sure
I'm not distracting you?

05:56.766 --> 05:59.166
Are you kidding?
I love it when you play.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.366
Thanks.

06:00.433 --> 06:02.533
I can never practice
like this at home.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.233
Doesn't your mom
like your music?

06:04.300 --> 06:06.033
Sometimes.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.266
Depending on what pill she's on.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.100
That's cold, Roni.

06:10.166 --> 06:11.566
That's pretty cold.

06:14.466 --> 06:16.666
Practice was a bitch today.

06:17.633 --> 06:19.833
Saw you taking to Harris today.

06:19.900 --> 06:21.600
Are you in some kind of trouble?

06:21.666 --> 06:22.966
No, I'm fine.

06:24.566 --> 06:27.100
John, what was Harris
talking to you about?

06:27.166 --> 06:29.333
- The usual.
- Are you sure you're okay?

06:29.400 --> 06:31.500
I mean ever since you
found that person..

06:31.566 --> 06:34.033
...you've been sort of quiet.

06:34.100 --> 06:36.266
I'm over that now.
Everything's fine.

06:37.166 --> 06:39.766
What about y-your nightmares?

06:42.233 --> 06:43.533
What about them?

06:44.666 --> 06:46.600
I can handle a few bad dreams.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.500
You don't
have to handle them alone.

06:49.566 --> 06:51.633
If there was something
to tell you

06:51.700 --> 06:53.233
I'd tell you.

06:54.466 --> 06:56.433
Come on, I'll walk you home.

07:01.366 --> 07:03.000
'Roni.'

07:05.166 --> 07:06.866
Roni.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.533
The Chopper.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.933
I hate cut-rate competition.

08:01.966 --> 08:03.300
John.

08:07.300 --> 08:09.633
- You're back!
- We had to come back.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.133
Really, John, an F?

08:11.200 --> 08:13.266
And you told us
everything was fine.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.566
It's only one grade,
everything else is an A.

08:15.633 --> 08:18.166
But you lied to us.

08:18.233 --> 08:19.366
It's what you wanted to hear.

08:19.433 --> 08:21.333
What we want is the truth.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.133
Thank God, your English teacher
tracked us down.

08:24.200 --> 08:25.600
And it seems that
there's something else

08:25.666 --> 08:27.600
you forgot to tell us about.

08:55.766 --> 08:57.300
'Johnny.'

08:57.366 --> 09:00.333
'It's time
to take your medicine.'

09:00.400 --> 09:02.333
It was just one F!

09:05.800 --> 09:08.400
'Time you take your medicine.'

09:47.533 --> 09:51.466
'Oh, I hate squeaks.
They drive me nuts.'

09:52.533 --> 09:54.600
It's a chair, coach,
not a salad.

09:54.666 --> 09:56.666
Don't you think
you're overdoing it?

09:58.433 --> 10:00.433
The proof's in the pudding.

10:02.800 --> 10:05.300
No more squeaks.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.666
Now, you.

10:09.733 --> 10:11.500
You wanna tell me
about your squeaks?

10:11.566 --> 10:12.933
You're gonna need more oil

10:15.600 --> 10:17.233
Don't worry about it.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.800
Hey, I got a lot invested in ya.

10:19.866 --> 10:22.366
If there's a kink in the system,
I wanna know about it.

10:22.433 --> 10:24.200
I just don't know why everyone's
making a big deal about it.

10:24.266 --> 10:26.033
Nobody's making a big deal
out of it.

10:26.100 --> 10:28.933
One of your...teachers
happens to be concerned.

10:30.166 --> 10:32.800
Why now all of a sudden?

10:32.866 --> 10:35.333
John, you've been a super boy

10:35.400 --> 10:36.966
at this school for three years.

10:37.033 --> 10:39.966
Any chink in the armor
is gonna draw attention.

10:40.033 --> 10:43.300
Yeah, attention from everyone
except my parents, right?

10:43.366 --> 10:45.000
That's the price of fame, kid.

10:45.066 --> 10:47.000
What's that supposed to mean?

10:47.066 --> 10:49.666
What would you do if you had
a kid that did everything right?

10:49.733 --> 10:51.666
After a while,
you'd stop paying attention.

10:51.733 --> 10:54.100
You'd expect perfection.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.633
My mistake, I should have been
a chronic screw up, right?

10:56.700 --> 10:58.166
Like the Chopper?

11:01.433 --> 11:03.066
Why bring that up?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.633
Roni came to see me today.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.633
She told me
about your nightmares.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.266
I don't believe her!

11:12.333 --> 11:13.766
Hey, don't get mad.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.033
She just cares about you,
she loves you.

11:19.133 --> 11:21.366
Any of your friends
know about them?

11:22.566 --> 11:25.600
I don't have friends.
I have fans.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.633
They'd think I was a wuss
being afraid of dreams.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.100
Are you afraid?

11:30.366 --> 11:32.700
They're really bad, coach.

11:32.766 --> 11:35.233
They usually start with me
back at where I found the body.

11:36.300 --> 11:38.166
'Last night's was different.'

11:38.233 --> 11:39.566
How?

11:39.633 --> 11:42.300
Last night he got my parents.

11:42.366 --> 11:44.700
He just looked up at me.
Swinging his axe.

11:44.766 --> 11:47.300
Did you see him? See his face?

11:47.366 --> 11:49.833
No, it's just like
it was in real life.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.366
I only saw him for a second.

11:52.433 --> 11:55.533
In the dream,
I'm so close though.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.066
But you still didn't
see him clearly?

11:58.133 --> 12:00.533
No, I'm always on the verge.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.400
I just know he's after me.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.100
Maybe he wants you
because he thinks you saw him.

12:09.633 --> 12:11.866
That's the weird thing,
he doesn't wanna kill me.

12:14.700 --> 12:18.100
None of your friends know about
these dreams, just you and Roni?

12:32.400 --> 12:33.766
'Hey.'

12:34.966 --> 12:36.900
Try to be on time tomorrow.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.966
You had no right to talk to him.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.766
John, you can't keep walking
around like everything's fine.

13:04.833 --> 13:06.533
You had no right to interfere.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.333
Interfere? I'm supposed to be
a part of your life.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.833
You are, but I can handle
my own problems.

13:11.900 --> 13:14.433
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your parents.

13:14.500 --> 13:15.733
I'll make sure
I don't talk at all.

13:15.800 --> 13:18.800
John, please,
I am only trying to help.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.566
I just knew that you would talk
to Harris before you talk to me.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.466
What the hell
are you talking about?

13:23.533 --> 13:25.366
You always shut me out.

13:25.433 --> 13:26.800
I tell you everything
about my life

13:26.866 --> 13:29.866
and you don't tell me anything,
you keep everything inside.

13:29.933 --> 13:31.800
Roni, you know I love you.

13:31.866 --> 13:34.700
I'm not talking about
you telling me "I love you."

13:34.766 --> 13:37.000
I'm talking about
you letting me in.

13:37.066 --> 13:39.366
I didn't even know that you
found the Chopper's last victim

13:39.433 --> 13:42.033
until...I saw it on the news.

13:42.100 --> 13:44.933
- What do you want me to do--
- I want you to talk to me.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.200
You don't have to hide
anything from me.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.533
Don't you understand?

13:53.866 --> 13:55.133
Forget it.

13:57.900 --> 13:59.133
Just call me when you have
something to say--

13:59.200 --> 14:00.900
Roni, don't go.

14:03.433 --> 14:04.666
God.

14:06.566 --> 14:09.466
'There's no new news tonight
regarding the identity'

14:09.533 --> 14:12.000
'or capture
of the Springwood "Chopper."'

14:12.066 --> 14:14.433
'Authorities report that
many people have co..'

14:24.500 --> 14:27.500
Hi, Roni. It's John.

14:29.966 --> 14:33.100
I'm sorry about before.
I wanna open up.

14:34.066 --> 14:35.533
It's just hard.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.733
Great, I sound like Alan Alda.

14:46.166 --> 14:48.933
Hi, Roni,
I'm sorry about before.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.666
I just called to say
I love you.

14:52.966 --> 14:55.533
Now, I'm Stevie Wonder.

15:44.433 --> 15:47.200
'Jo-o-o-ohn.'

16:04.666 --> 16:08.133
'John. You never let me in.'

16:08.833 --> 16:12.366
Sorry! I need you.

16:13.600 --> 16:14.866
Roni!

16:19.333 --> 16:22.266
You never talked to her anyway.

16:29.900 --> 16:31.800
No!

16:35.733 --> 16:37.533
No!

16:45.866 --> 16:47.966
'John.'

16:49.033 --> 16:50.966
- Roni?
- 'John.'

16:51.833 --> 16:54.033
Do you know what time it is?

16:55.666 --> 16:59.300
'It's time to take
your medicine.'

17:03.533 --> 17:05.800
'No-o-o-o!'

17:30.433 --> 17:31.833
Roni?

17:33.100 --> 17:34.466
Oh, just let me hold you

17:34.533 --> 17:36.200
and feel you're all here
in one piece.

17:36.266 --> 17:37.700
It's okay, I'm all here.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.933
I tried to call you last night.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.333
- To tell you I was sorry.
- Sorry.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.433
I know I don't always show it..

17:44.500 --> 17:46.466
...but I don't want you
to ever go, okay?

17:46.533 --> 17:48.000
It's a deal.

17:57.366 --> 17:59.000
I know what he wants there
when he's after me.

17:59.066 --> 18:00.200
In your dreams, you mean.

18:00.266 --> 18:03.733
It's Roni. She's next.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.700
You sound like a flaky sidekick

18:05.766 --> 18:07.266
in a bad cop show.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.633
You wanna hear
about this or not?

18:08.700 --> 18:11.266
I'm sorry,
I got a sick sense of humor.

18:12.833 --> 18:15.300
'I've never felt so scared.'

18:15.366 --> 18:17.900
She's the one person in my life
who's there all the time.

18:17.966 --> 18:20.066
Good or bad.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.300
For an instant, I saw her dead.

18:23.366 --> 18:25.100
Didn't you see anymore
of the Chopper?

18:25.166 --> 18:27.766
Anymore detail?

18:27.833 --> 18:31.166
No. It's always the same.
I get a glimpse.

18:31.233 --> 18:33.600
But it's not enough.

18:33.666 --> 18:35.766
Why do you think he wants Roni?

18:35.833 --> 18:38.300
We had a fight
before I went to sleep.

18:38.366 --> 18:39.566
Maybe that's why.

18:39.633 --> 18:41.300
Before that
it was your parents.

18:41.366 --> 18:44.233
Yeah, God, I'm siccing him
on them in my dreams.

18:44.300 --> 18:45.600
It's not unusual.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.733
You were pissed at your parents

18:46.800 --> 18:48.200
and then you were pissed
at Roni.

18:48.266 --> 18:50.633
Pissed is one thing.
The Chopper's another.

18:50.700 --> 18:52.533
Look, we're not talking
about reality here.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.000
We're talking about your dreams.

18:55.066 --> 18:57.500
People can get very ugly
in their dreams.

18:57.566 --> 18:58.766
Why am I having them at all?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.366
I don't know.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.566
Maybe you're trying to tell
yourself something.

19:02.633 --> 19:06.133
- 'Something you don't know.'
- I just want them to stop.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.166
I wish they'd catch this guy.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.266
Roni's alone a lot

19:08.333 --> 19:10.333
and all the other victims
were women.

19:11.566 --> 19:13.566
You're thinking
far too literally.

19:13.633 --> 19:16.100
The real Chopper
is probably miles from here.

19:17.766 --> 19:21.466
If I could just see the face.
I'm so close.

19:21.533 --> 19:23.733
Every time I dream, I see more.

19:24.700 --> 19:26.200
Well, don't try too hard, John.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.266
You might not like what you see.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.166
'You're all knotted up.'

19:53.233 --> 19:55.700
Oh, I always get this way
around bedtime.

19:55.766 --> 19:58.066
What could we do about it?

19:58.133 --> 19:59.833
Can you spend the night?

19:59.900 --> 20:01.800
I'd feel better if I knew
you were here with me.

20:01.866 --> 20:04.600
And I thought you'd never ask.

20:04.666 --> 20:07.133
I'll call my mom
and tell her I'm at Debbie's.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.600
- She won't mind?
- Are you kidding?

20:09.666 --> 20:12.400
It's a relief for her
to get me out of the house

20:12.466 --> 20:14.700
Won't she worry about you being
out with the Chopper around?

20:14.766 --> 20:17.500
Nah, she'll know
I'm really with you.

20:17.566 --> 20:19.433
It's sort of a game we play.

20:20.866 --> 20:23.566
Besides how much safer
could I be than right here

20:25.200 --> 20:27.066
I'll make a call.

21:22.466 --> 21:24.400
Not again.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.700
John?

22:01.233 --> 22:02.866
John?

22:12.133 --> 22:14.000
John?

22:20.233 --> 22:22.133
John?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.933
John?

22:25.000 --> 22:28.166
It's time to take your medicine.

22:51.366 --> 22:53.966
'Honey, we're back.'

23:09.400 --> 23:11.700
He's with the paramedics now.

23:12.633 --> 23:14.533
Has he said anything?

23:15.600 --> 23:18.266
No. They just put him out.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.633
Now, I haven't said a thing.

23:21.700 --> 23:23.700
I-I just said
he had a breakdown.

23:23.766 --> 23:26.300
Well, we appreciate it,
but, uh, do you understand

23:26.366 --> 23:28.666
what would happen
if word got out?

23:30.900 --> 23:32.766
I still can't believe
that John's the Chopper.

23:32.833 --> 23:35.300
Don't say it.
You want our name ruined?

23:35.366 --> 23:37.733
It's better this way.

23:37.800 --> 23:39.766
Uh, we'll see
that he's put away.

23:39.833 --> 23:41.833
But by us, not the courts.

23:43.800 --> 23:45.000
Yeah.

23:45.066 --> 23:47.500
How did you know?
To come here?

23:51.300 --> 23:54.600
Well, he'd been talking about
it, he knew too much detail.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.766
And then the other day,
Roni called me.

23:56.833 --> 23:59.033
I was upset.

23:59.100 --> 24:01.400
'John and I were
having a fight and..'

24:01.466 --> 24:02.866
'...he talks to Harris, so..'

24:02.933 --> 24:06.500
See, Roni's phone call
bothered me.

24:06.566 --> 24:08.700
It sounded like
John was cracking.

24:09.633 --> 24:11.466
When I came to visit, um..

24:13.600 --> 24:15.366
'...I found..'

24:16.966 --> 24:19.133
...what I found.

24:29.766 --> 24:32.000
- I'm the Chopper?
- Yes.

24:32.700 --> 24:34.833
I'm crazy?

24:34.900 --> 24:36.266
'Yeah.'

24:36.333 --> 24:38.200
Go figure.

24:50.733 --> 24:54.733
Ah, the tender story

24:54.800 --> 24:58.533
of a boy...and his axe.

25:43.933 --> 25:46.566
What's the matter, Roni,
out of tune?

25:46.633 --> 25:48.166
You should have kno-o-own!

25:50.566 --> 25:52.000
You should have kno-o-own!

25:59.233 --> 26:01.833
Roni, Roni, it's okay.
It's alright.

26:01.900 --> 26:03.866
It's alright, it's okay,
baby, it's okay.

26:03.933 --> 26:05.966
It's okay, it's okay,
we're gonna be fine.

26:06.033 --> 26:08.700
It's okay, baby,
it's okay, it's okay.

26:08.766 --> 26:10.400
Shh, shh, shh.

26:10.466 --> 26:12.300
It's getting late, John.

26:13.500 --> 26:15.400
You wanna talk to me?

26:19.033 --> 26:21.733
Guy walks into a bar,
he's got a donkey with him.

26:24.433 --> 26:26.933
You're giving me
a complex, John.

26:27.966 --> 26:29.133
Hey, you were caught in the act

26:29.200 --> 26:31.166
of being
the Springwood "Chopper."

26:31.233 --> 26:32.400
You killed three women

26:32.466 --> 26:33.500
you were about to kill
the fourth

26:33.566 --> 26:36.266
your own girlfriend.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.533
You haven't said a word
since the day

26:37.600 --> 26:39.933
they brought you here, why

26:40.000 --> 26:43.033
- I'm trying to think.
- Think about what?

26:43.100 --> 26:44.466
- How I got here--
- You know how.

26:44.533 --> 26:45.566
You're the Chopper.

26:45.633 --> 26:47.333
You tried to kill Roni.
I caught you.

26:48.533 --> 26:49.600
Roni, I love Roni--

26:49.666 --> 26:52.100
No, no, no.
A part of you hated her.

26:52.166 --> 26:54.333
The part with the big axe,
you remember.

26:56.333 --> 26:58.833
- I'm the Chopper--
- Yes, that's it. That's it.

26:58.900 --> 27:00.533
Now you've got it.

27:00.600 --> 27:01.766
See, the first part
of getting help

27:01.833 --> 27:04.166
is admitting
that you've got a problem.

27:05.033 --> 27:08.000
I feel so...unclear and fuzzy.

27:08.066 --> 27:11.633
If it starts getting clearer,
you call me.

27:11.700 --> 27:13.900
I care about you,
don't forget that.

27:14.833 --> 27:16.466
I can help.

27:28.733 --> 27:30.166
- Roni?
- What?

27:32.733 --> 27:34.300
Are you sure
you're up to school today?

27:34.366 --> 27:35.666
What makes today any different

27:35.733 --> 27:38.133
from the rest of the days
of my life?

27:38.200 --> 27:40.166
I have to learn to live with it.

27:40.233 --> 27:42.200
I wish that there was something
that I could do or say

27:42.266 --> 27:43.933
to make that hurt go away.

27:44.000 --> 27:47.033
I just can't believe
that John's gone, put away.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.966
All that time I spent with him,
I couldn't see a thing.

27:50.033 --> 27:51.900
You can't blame yourself
for John's condition.

27:51.966 --> 27:53.700
I don't blame myself,
I just can't believe

27:53.766 --> 27:55.100
that he could hide it from me.

27:55.166 --> 27:57.166
Honey, it's better
that you learned it now.

27:57.233 --> 27:58.633
Learned what?

27:58.700 --> 28:00.833
They all have something to hide.

28:00.900 --> 28:02.900
Something they don't
want us to see.

28:03.800 --> 28:06.133
Your father was no exception.

28:06.200 --> 28:08.600
I just can't get him
out of my mind.

28:08.666 --> 28:12.100
If I get this job, sweetie
we are gonna move far away

28:12.166 --> 28:14.666
Start again.

28:14.733 --> 28:15.866
Well, why do you
have to go all the way

28:15.933 --> 28:18.266
to Chicago for the interview?

28:18.333 --> 28:20.500
We've been through this.
I have to.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.433
I won't be gone long.

28:23.500 --> 28:24.800
Long enough.

28:24.866 --> 28:27.000
Roni, I am doing this
for both of us.

28:27.066 --> 28:28.633
For you mostly.

28:30.366 --> 28:32.166
Thanks.

28:32.233 --> 28:34.533
Roni. Roni!

29:22.233 --> 29:23.733
Are you having trouble?

29:23.800 --> 29:25.333
I hate these skates.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.466
Well, hold on.

29:26.533 --> 29:28.500
I used to have a pair
just like this.

29:33.033 --> 29:34.233
- There.
- Thanks.

29:34.300 --> 29:35.900
I told you not to talk
to strangers.

29:35.966 --> 29:37.233
Get in here.

29:39.200 --> 29:41.300
Bye.

29:55.433 --> 29:56.966
This woman was staring at me

29:57.033 --> 29:59.400
like I was gonna kill
her daughter.

29:59.466 --> 30:01.400
- You're overreacting.
- No, I'm not.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.733
Everybody's looking at me
like I'm some kind of leper.

30:03.800 --> 30:06.133
Roni, that's impossible.

30:06.200 --> 30:09.666
You, me and John's parents
are the only people who know.

30:10.766 --> 30:12.966
We quietly
committed him, remember?

30:13.033 --> 30:14.866
Well, maybe we were wrong.

30:14.933 --> 30:18.800
I know it's hard, but the boy
was coming at you with an axe.

30:18.866 --> 30:21.700
It's tearing me a apart inside.

30:21.766 --> 30:23.266
How could this be real?

30:23.333 --> 30:26.333
How could...this monster
be John?

30:26.400 --> 30:29.333
Monsters don't always
look like monsters.

30:33.000 --> 30:35.866
If it's any consolation,
he fooled me too.

30:35.933 --> 30:37.866
Maybe, Mr. Harris.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.133
But he wasn't a part of you.

30:45.466 --> 30:47.100
'I dreamt about him last night.'

30:47.166 --> 30:49.700
- What did you see?
- I saw his victims.

30:49.766 --> 30:52.233
And I saw him.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.533
It just doesn't seem real.

30:55.600 --> 30:58.566
Even in the dream,
it seems like it's...phony.

30:58.633 --> 31:02.600
Like it's...just not John.

31:02.666 --> 31:04.600
Well, who do you think it is?

31:06.700 --> 31:08.633
Just not John.

31:13.933 --> 31:16.333
Okay, now..

31:16.400 --> 31:17.666
...you've got my number?

31:17.733 --> 31:19.400
And promise to call
if you need me.

31:19.466 --> 31:22.033
Sure.
Good luck with your interview.

31:22.100 --> 31:24.300
Thanks.
Oh, God, there's the cab.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.300
I'll see you soon, sweetie

31:27.366 --> 31:28.400
- You're okay?
- Mm-hmm.

31:28.466 --> 31:29.666
- You're sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

31:29.733 --> 31:33.100
Okay. Bye, darling.
I'll see you soon.

31:33.166 --> 31:34.433
- Bye.
- Bye.

32:25.466 --> 32:28.100
Her boyfriend misses her.

32:28.833 --> 32:32.233
He's in here...waiting.

33:07.466 --> 33:10.633
It's time to take your medicine.

33:25.966 --> 33:27.966
Time to take your medicine.

33:29.333 --> 33:31.866
More...medicine.

35:11.466 --> 35:14.133
What's wrong with this picture?

35:46.600 --> 35:49.200
What, John?

35:49.266 --> 35:51.433
What are you trying to tell me?

36:39.800 --> 36:42.033
'Time to take medicine.'

36:42.933 --> 36:44.900
'Not their medicine.'

36:46.733 --> 36:48.700
They're not just dreams.

36:48.766 --> 36:50.666
He's trying
to tell me something.

36:50.733 --> 36:53.266
Roni, you're not dealing
with this very well.

36:53.333 --> 36:56.066
He's trying to tell me
that something's wrong.

36:56.133 --> 36:58.200
That things can't be
what they seem to be.

36:58.266 --> 37:01.166
Well, now that sounds
like wishful thinking.

37:01.233 --> 37:03.400
Let it rest, you're only
gonna make things worse.

37:03.466 --> 37:05.200
Things don't get worse.

37:06.566 --> 37:09.833
Sweetie...your mind is looking
for the easy way out.

37:09.900 --> 37:12.433
I wish he were innocent too, but
he has already admitted to it.

37:12.500 --> 37:15.200
Well, then he was lying,
don't you understand?

37:16.466 --> 37:18.666
I loved him.

37:19.733 --> 37:21.933
I made love to him.

37:24.433 --> 37:25.633
Please, go see him again.

37:25.700 --> 37:27.866
Roni, don't you see
it's useless.

37:27.933 --> 37:29.933
Please!

37:32.166 --> 37:33.500
Fine.

37:35.466 --> 37:37.200
I'll go see him again.

37:39.200 --> 37:41.733
But I really think
you should leave it alone.

37:42.400 --> 37:43.900
Don't you see?

37:47.400 --> 37:48.933
I can't.

37:53.966 --> 37:55.900
There's no smoking in here.

38:00.766 --> 38:02.766
You seem more together, John.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.733
You been taking your medication?

38:07.633 --> 38:08.700
Yes.

38:09.633 --> 38:10.933
Good.

38:17.933 --> 38:20.066
Are you still dreaming?

38:20.133 --> 38:22.300
'It's hard to tell.'

38:22.366 --> 38:25.800
Something there.
The Chopper--

38:25.866 --> 38:27.866
Roni persists
in thinking you're innocent.

38:27.933 --> 38:30.100
She asked me
to come and see you.

38:30.166 --> 38:31.533
How is she?

38:31.600 --> 38:33.466
She's very upset.

38:33.533 --> 38:35.800
You don't wanna upset her
anymore, do you?

38:35.900 --> 38:36.833
No.

38:36.900 --> 38:38.933
And you know what you did..

38:39.000 --> 38:41.433
...don't you?

38:41.500 --> 38:44.433
- You are..
- The Chopper?

38:44.500 --> 38:47.033
You have to accept it.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.633
And then we can start
the long road back.

38:53.833 --> 38:56.700
Now...it's time
to take your medicine.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.866
Time for me to go.

39:50.033 --> 39:52.566
'No, honey.
Our house never had a basement.'

39:54.300 --> 39:55.500
Are you sure?

39:55.566 --> 39:56.633
'Yeah,
there's nothing underneath '

39:56.700 --> 39:59.400
'but solid concrete and soil.'

39:59.466 --> 40:01.233
'Are you sure
everything's fine?'

40:03.233 --> 40:05.166
Uh, yeah, I guess, um..

40:06.366 --> 40:08.633
It's probably just rodents
or something.

40:08.700 --> 40:10.900
'Great. Well, listen,
we-we'll call the exterminator'

40:10.966 --> 40:13.133
'when I get back, okay?'

40:13.200 --> 40:15.500
'I love you. Bye.'

40:15.566 --> 40:17.100
Bye.

41:05.066 --> 41:07.766
- Look at this!
- Oh, my God! What is it?

41:07.833 --> 41:09.333
Look there was another murder
last night.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.400
Another body found, just like
the Chopper's others.

41:11.466 --> 41:13.533
- Roni.
- It has to be him.

41:13.600 --> 41:14.700
That means that John's innocent

41:14.766 --> 41:16.033
and he's been locked up
all this time.

41:16.100 --> 41:19.066
- Roni.
- Look, we have to move.

41:19.133 --> 41:20.966
See, I was right all the time.

41:21.033 --> 41:24.033
John wasn't the one.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.100
W-what are you waiting for?
Call someone.

41:26.166 --> 41:28.100
John escaped last night.

41:29.166 --> 41:31.800
- He what?
- Sometime last night.

41:31.866 --> 41:34.166
They called his parents
and then they called me.

41:34.233 --> 41:36.366
Now, you know what this means,
it won't take long

41:36.433 --> 41:38.333
for the police to put
two and two together.

41:39.600 --> 41:40.766
This isn't happening.

41:40.833 --> 41:43.233
Is your mother back yet?

41:43.300 --> 41:44.766
Well,
you can't stay alone tonight.

41:44.833 --> 41:45.966
Not with him out there.

41:46.033 --> 41:47.133
Well, you have to stay
with a friend.

41:47.200 --> 41:48.833
Well, John was the only friend
I ever had.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.066
Well, make some new ones, fast.

41:53.300 --> 41:54.666
You can stay with me.

41:54.733 --> 41:57.300
No. You leave me alone.

42:00.766 --> 42:02.833
Has he contacted you yet?

42:04.333 --> 42:05.900
No.

42:10.866 --> 42:13.666
The police are looking for him,
they'll find him.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.700
He's your son.

42:16.766 --> 42:19.233
He's a...bad machine.

42:20.533 --> 42:21.866
It happens.

42:21.933 --> 42:24.800
He-he looks fine
on the outside..

42:24.866 --> 42:27.400
...but bad on the inside.

43:00.533 --> 43:02.966
What is that damn noise?

43:44.366 --> 43:47.233
'Roni, come down here.
I need you.'

44:40.366 --> 44:43.700
They all have something
to hide, all of them.

44:43.766 --> 44:46.166
'Don't believe
everything you read.'

44:46.233 --> 44:48.833
After all,
looks can be deceiving.

45:05.866 --> 45:09.300
It was just a dream.
It-it doesn't prove anything.

45:12.433 --> 45:14.966
I'm still dreaming.

45:15.033 --> 45:17.000
'Finally.'

45:17.066 --> 45:20.800
'It's time
to take your medicine.'

45:20.866 --> 45:22.933
Somebody help me.

45:30.300 --> 45:32.400
John, leave me alone!

45:41.333 --> 45:45.366
John, please, leave me alone.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.200
Roni, it's okay now.

45:50.266 --> 45:52.200
'Thank God, I got here in time.'

45:53.266 --> 45:55.033
What's the matter?
Don't you see?

45:55.100 --> 45:57.866
Harris was the Chopper.
He took advantage of me.

45:57.933 --> 45:59.900
Made me believe
I was the Chopper.

45:59.966 --> 46:02.133
It kept nagging at me,
something I saw in my dreams

46:02.200 --> 46:03.533
and kept forgetting.

46:03.600 --> 46:05.700
I started to come out of it
in the hospital.

46:05.766 --> 46:07.700
'Something he said
brought it together.'

46:08.933 --> 46:10.200
We're safe now.

46:10.266 --> 46:11.500
Get away from her.

46:11.566 --> 46:13.566
No, don't you see it was him.

46:13.633 --> 46:14.733
Yeah, sure, kid.

46:14.800 --> 46:16.966
Roni, for God sakes,
tell 'em what you saw.

46:17.033 --> 46:19.933
I don't know what I saw!

46:20.000 --> 46:21.866
- Come on!
- No, you've got the wrong guy.

46:21.933 --> 46:24.733
- 'John!'
- You got the wrong guy!

46:43.900 --> 46:47.400
Who said justice is blind?

46:47.466 --> 46:50.900
In Springwood, the innocent..

46:50.966 --> 46:53.600
...are always found...guilty.
