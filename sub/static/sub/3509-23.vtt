00:25.384 --> 00:26.461
Huh?

00:29.209 --> 00:30.626
Okay, cue the chandelier.

00:33.355 --> 00:34.309
Yeah! Yeah!

00:47.793 --> 00:51.520
Illinois? That's like 500
miles from Manhattan.

00:51.521 --> 00:54.196
No, I know Northwestern
is closer than Stanford.

00:54.293 --> 00:57.131
- I'm just saying, that's not
where you want to go. - Alexis?

00:57.132 --> 00:59.525
Hold on, Ash. My dad's talking to me. 
What?

00:59.526 --> 01:02.055
Don't you have school? 
Yes.

01:02.264 --> 01:03.786
Look, Ash, I know you,

01:03.787 --> 01:05.235
and I think you need to get away from home.

01:05.236 --> 01:08.025
- I mean, we all need to
get away from home. - Hey.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.340
I gotta go. We'll talk about this later.

01:10.551 --> 01:12.317
Love you, too. Bye.

01:13.128 --> 01:16.369
"We all need to get away from home"?
No. I should never leave.

01:16.370 --> 01:18.720
We can be the father-daughter
version of "Grey Gardens."

01:18.721 --> 01:19.349
Ew.

01:20.502 --> 01:22.038
You look like you didn't get any sleep.

01:22.039 --> 01:23.082
I didn't.

01:23.083 --> 01:26.308
I mean, Ashley got his college acceptances.

01:26.309 --> 01:27.544
He got in everywhere.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.856
Well, that's great. 
That's not great?

01:29.857 --> 01:32.082
I looked up statistics for
high-school sweethearts

01:32.083 --> 01:34.003
when one of them goes
to college out of state

01:34.004 --> 01:35.434
and the other stays in high school.

01:35.435 --> 01:37.163
The odds are not in our favor.

01:37.219 --> 01:38.472
I mean, I want him to go where he wants,

01:38.473 --> 01:40.959
but I don't want him to leave,
and he doesn't want to leave,

01:40.960 --> 01:43.366
but I don't want him to resent
me for not going where he wants,

01:43.367 --> 01:45.706
and I don't know what to do. 
Well,

01:45.707 --> 01:49.307
do what I do.
Look at the odds as a challenge.

01:49.308 --> 01:52.494
Says the man who always loses in Vegas.
Relationships are hard.

01:53.263 --> 01:55.036
Odds are, you'll figure it out.

01:56.328 --> 01:58.494
Odds are, someone's dead.

02:01.228 --> 02:02.418
Castle.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.948
You've gotta be kidding me.

02:04.949 --> 02:07.227
A murder in the theater 
of the V.B. Tower Hotel,

02:07.228 --> 02:08.520
Victor Baron's place?

02:08.521 --> 02:09.692
It's not the Baron, is it?

02:09.693 --> 02:11.024
No, but you won't be disappointed.

02:11.025 --> 02:13.262
This one's right up your alley.
Why is that?

02:13.263 --> 02:15.459
Because our victim is a contestant.

02:16.290 --> 02:19.158
Death of a beauty queen-- 
Scandalous.

02:19.159 --> 02:21.724
Yeah, surprised it doesn't
happen more often.

02:23.325 --> 02:25.158
Is that America's dad, Bobby Stark?

02:25.159 --> 02:26.213
What's he doing here?

02:26.214 --> 02:27.513
He's the pageant host.

02:27.514 --> 02:28.278
Oh, please don't tell me

02:28.279 --> 02:30.787
that you watch his sitcom.
"Family Foibles"?

02:30.788 --> 02:32.717
Half of what I know about being a father,

02:32.718 --> 02:34.401
I learned from watching that show.

02:34.584 --> 02:36.796
Hey, Beckett. 
So what's the story?

02:36.797 --> 02:40.032
Well, according to Candace
Ford, our pageant manager,

02:40.033 --> 02:42.836
the victim is 21-year-old
Amber Middleberry.

02:43.650 --> 02:44.732
Yeah, I got it.

02:44.733 --> 02:46.933
The contestants were rehearsing
a production number.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.937
When they brought in the lighting truss,

02:48.938 --> 02:51.382
Amber was tangled up inside of it.

02:51.383 --> 02:53.912
Must've been a showstopper.
Hey there, Perlmutter.

02:53.913 --> 02:57.612
Detective. Writer. 
Cause of death?

02:57.613 --> 03:00.151
Choked from behind with her own sash.
Hmm.

03:00.152 --> 03:03.438
Probably between 11:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M.

03:03.439 --> 03:04.887
How did she end up on the lighting truss?

03:04.888 --> 03:07.073
Near as we can tell, the,
uh, lighting truss

03:07.074 --> 03:09.438
was left on stage after
yesterday's rehearsal.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.364
Killer probably thought he'd buy some time

03:11.365 --> 03:13.388
by dumping her on it and
raising it up to the rafters.

03:13.389 --> 03:14.551
So whoever it was must have known

03:14.552 --> 03:16.101
how to use the stage equipment. 
Nah,

03:16.102 --> 03:17.881
the lift controls, they're
on a touch screen.

03:17.882 --> 03:19.482
Pretty easy to operate.

03:19.483 --> 03:21.712
When was she last seen alive?
Last night.

03:21.713 --> 03:24.652
Contestants--they all went to a
dinner to honor Victor Baron.

03:24.653 --> 03:26.091
10:30, the party wrapped,

03:26.092 --> 03:27.952
and they were all limoed
back here to the hotel.

03:27.953 --> 03:30.225
Amber used her key card at 10:43 P.M.

03:30.226 --> 03:31.608
to get into her hotel room.

03:31.609 --> 03:33.885
After that, she, uh, wound up here.

03:34.145 --> 03:36.351
Detective, there's
something you should see.

03:38.862 --> 03:40.169
A black sequin?

03:40.367 --> 03:42.427
Part of one. I found it in her hair.

03:42.428 --> 03:43.972
Okay, so the killer might
have transferred it

03:43.973 --> 03:45.549
when he strangled her.

03:45.550 --> 03:48.271
Let's find out who had access
to this ballroom last night.

03:48.272 --> 03:50.089
And let's also talk to the pageant manager.

03:50.090 --> 03:52.305
I want to see if any of the girls' outfits

03:52.306 --> 03:54.107
match with this sequin. 
Will do.

03:54.453 --> 03:56.429
So does Amber Middleberry have any family?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.807
Yeah. Just her, uh, dad.

04:04.180 --> 04:05.872
She started when she was 9...

04:06.944 --> 04:08.418
Little Miss Wholesome.

04:09.029 --> 04:11.073
Oh, I was against the whole idea at first,

04:11.074 --> 04:13.774
but Amber's mom had a
bug about it, and, uh,

04:14.207 --> 04:15.929
and after her mother died...

04:16.629 --> 04:19.055
I think it just helped
her feel closer to her.

04:20.295 --> 04:22.559
Did your daughter have any
enemies that you know of?

04:22.560 --> 04:24.511
No, of course not. Everybody loved Amber.

04:24.512 --> 04:25.855
Well, what about the other contestants?

04:25.960 --> 04:27.055
Were there any rivalries?

04:27.056 --> 04:28.897
She went way back with some of these girls.

04:28.898 --> 04:31.665
They-- even after she made
it to the semifinals,

04:31.666 --> 04:33.378
everybody was hugging her, and they were--

04:33.379 --> 04:35.655
They were calling her the
front-runner, and, uh...

04:37.291 --> 04:41.190
This pageant, this one... was her dream.

04:42.707 --> 04:44.393
When was the last time you talked with her?

04:44.394 --> 04:47.439
Yesterday morning.
I, uh, I tried to call her last night.

04:47.440 --> 04:49.254
I knew that dinner thing was over.

04:49.382 --> 04:50.582
I wanted to wish her luck, you know,

04:50.583 --> 04:54.125
but... she didn't answer the phone.

04:54.559 --> 04:56.133
And what time was that?

04:56.471 --> 04:57.805
A little before 11:00.

04:57.806 --> 05:00.952
I, uh... I thought she
must have gone to sleep,

05:00.953 --> 05:02.919
but she must have left her room

05:02.920 --> 05:06.265
and come down here for some reason.

05:07.755 --> 05:08.712
Dan.

05:09.133 --> 05:10.967
I am so sorry.

05:11.268 --> 05:12.598
We're gonna get the bastard who did this.

05:12.599 --> 05:14.957
You have my word. 
Thank you, Mr. Baron.

05:15.297 --> 05:17.354
Detectives, a word upstairs
if you don't mind.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.701
This is a dark day.

05:23.912 --> 05:25.257
A sad chapter in the history

05:25.258 --> 05:27.328
of Baron's All-American Beauty Pageant.

05:27.742 --> 05:29.282
Victor, this is just awful.

05:30.638 --> 05:32.008
My wife Kayla.

05:32.226 --> 05:33.263
You might recognize her

05:33.264 --> 05:37.322
as Baron's All-American beauty, 1995.
Yes, of course.

05:37.443 --> 05:38.246
Nice to meet you.

05:38.247 --> 05:40.381
Nice to meet you, yes.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.462
This is just devastating, for
us and--and for the girls.

05:43.463 --> 05:46.079
We... we're like family.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.539
How well did you know her?

05:47.843 --> 05:52.199
Um, sh-she was a sweet girl,
a hell of a violinist.

05:52.200 --> 05:52.962
Yes, she was.

05:53.722 --> 05:56.749
Mark my words--I am
putting the entire weight

05:56.750 --> 05:59.170
of the Baron empire behind
this investigation.

05:59.171 --> 06:01.359
Anything you need, just say the word.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.904
Detective, I know, uh, you
have to do your thing.

06:04.159 --> 06:05.604
Uh, I'm just hoping,

06:05.857 --> 06:09.386
uh, since we are airing the
pageant live this Friday,

06:09.480 --> 06:11.723
if we could minimize the press, you know,

06:11.724 --> 06:13.210
to be fair to the other girls.

06:13.211 --> 06:15.647
We're gonna have to be
fair to our victim first.

06:15.648 --> 06:18.245
And speaking of press, could
we get rid of the cameras?

06:18.246 --> 06:20.220
This is, after all, a murder investigation

06:20.221 --> 06:23.646
not a reality show.
We, um, we film everything...

06:23.647 --> 06:25.701
Behind the scenes at the pageant.

06:25.702 --> 06:28.095
We like to catch the girls
talking about each other,

06:28.096 --> 06:30.453
let them confess their hopes and fears.

06:30.566 --> 06:32.879
You get the glamour, but you
also get the underbelly.

06:33.201 --> 06:35.518
People love the underbelly. 
Yes, they do.

06:37.638 --> 06:39.708
But maybe this isn't the time.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.887
So were all the girls staying at the hotel?

06:42.888 --> 06:44.904
That's right.
Okay, I'll need access to Amber's room.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.489
We'll also need hotel security tapes.

06:46.490 --> 06:49.896
- Now were those cameras recording
last night's dinner? - Of course.

06:49.897 --> 06:50.794
Okay, we'll need the footage.

06:50.795 --> 06:52.890
We'll also need to interview all
of the pageant contestants.

06:52.891 --> 06:54.637
I'll have Candace give
you anything you need.

06:54.764 --> 06:55.646
Great. Thank you very much.

06:55.647 --> 06:59.398
It was nice to meet you. 
Come again.

06:59.399 --> 07:00.633
Oh, no, we don't--

07:00.634 --> 07:01.894
We don't want them to come again, no.

07:02.458 --> 07:05.509
Small-town girl comes 
to New York for the fairy tale,

07:05.510 --> 07:08.309
ends up with the horror story.
Pageants aren't fairy tales.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.435
They're demanding,
high-pressure competitions

07:10.436 --> 07:13.508
that bring out the very best
and the very worst in people.

07:13.509 --> 07:16.064
That is the voice of experience.

07:16.065 --> 07:17.813
Oh, my God. You were a beauty queen.

07:17.952 --> 07:20.452
No. I had a roommate freshman
year--Debbie Winokur.

07:20.534 --> 07:22.416
It was like living with
Elle Woods on steroids.

07:23.848 --> 07:24.847
Well, then...

07:24.848 --> 07:26.560
This ought to bring back some memories.

07:29.926 --> 07:32.327
You're slouching. Winners never slouch.

07:34.182 --> 07:35.857
Castle, they're everywhere.

07:36.131 --> 07:38.533
Smells like a perfume counter
at a department store.

07:38.534 --> 07:40.911
Beats the usual lowlifes and nut jobs.

07:40.912 --> 07:41.833
I don't know if you can say

07:41.834 --> 07:44.195
that nut jobs and beauty
queens are mutually exclusive.

07:44.332 --> 07:45.629
Yeah, but none of 'em
connect to the murder.

07:45.630 --> 07:48.489
- I checked the sequin against
all their dresses...- I bet you did.

07:48.566 --> 07:49.714
And none of 'em are a match.

07:49.715 --> 07:50.872
Okay, look at the footage from the dinner.

07:50.873 --> 07:52.182
Let's make sure that the dresses we checked

07:52.183 --> 07:53.524
are the ones they actually wore.

07:53.525 --> 07:56.357
Hmm. Watch a parade of beautiful
women in evening attire?

07:56.358 --> 07:58.853
Yeah, I can do that. 
I bet you can.

08:01.479 --> 08:03.250
Hey, so I've been
interviewing these ladies...

08:03.251 --> 08:06.889
I bet you did.
About their alibis last night.

08:06.890 --> 08:09.517
- Anyway, there's someone that
you should talk to. - Mm-hmm.

08:10.847 --> 08:11.768
So tell 'em

08:11.769 --> 08:13.858
what you told me about what
happened after dinner.

08:14.090 --> 08:15.327
When we got back to the hotel,

08:15.328 --> 08:17.623
I wanted to go work out a
couple of my dance moves.

08:17.624 --> 08:20.721
I'm one of the semifinalists,
so I get to perform

08:20.820 --> 08:23.172
in the broadcast.
Congratulations.

08:23.173 --> 08:25.485
Thanks. I'm doing an interpretive dance

08:25.486 --> 08:27.466
to JLo's "I'm Into You."

08:29.915 --> 08:31.258
And then what happened?

08:31.259 --> 08:34.392
I changed into sweats
and went to the stage,

08:34.393 --> 08:36.969
and that's when I heard it.

08:37.379 --> 08:38.736
You heard what?

08:39.115 --> 08:40.774
Uh, a fight.

08:41.280 --> 08:43.655
It was coming from the dressing room.

08:43.886 --> 08:46.147
It was Amber and some guy.

08:46.343 --> 08:48.925
Did you see the guy? 
The door was closed.

08:48.926 --> 08:51.935
It started getting loud, so I bolted.

08:51.936 --> 08:53.994
But now I wish I had done something.

08:54.202 --> 08:58.320
I mean...maybe he's the one who killed her.

08:58.883 --> 09:01.893
His voice, did you recognize it?

09:01.894 --> 09:02.757
No.

09:03.416 --> 09:05.013
What were they arguing about?

09:05.014 --> 09:08.009
"How could you do this to me?
You have no right.

09:08.010 --> 09:10.170
Who do you think you are?" 
Stuff like that.

09:10.554 --> 09:12.654
It kinda sounded like he was her boyfriend.

09:14.238 --> 09:15.646
So that was Amber's dad.

09:15.647 --> 09:18.321
He said he didn't know
anything about a boyfriend.

09:18.322 --> 09:19.717
Neither did any of the other girls.

09:19.718 --> 09:21.273
Maybe she was keeping it a secret.

09:21.274 --> 09:24.266
He said, if anyone knew what
was going on in Amber's life,

09:24.267 --> 09:27.975
it was, uh, Justin Hankel,
Amber's pageant consultant.

09:28.191 --> 09:30.433
I coached her on her routine, interviews,

09:30.434 --> 09:33.812
oversaw stylists, makeup,
clothing, violin lessons,

09:33.813 --> 09:37.005
glamour shots-- everything
she needed to win.

09:37.006 --> 09:38.104
The two of you must have spent a

09:38.105 --> 09:40.619
lot of time together.
Well, that's what it takes.

09:40.620 --> 09:42.448
Today's pageants are not just about beauty.

09:42.449 --> 09:45.342
They're about brains,
talent, social issues.

09:45.343 --> 09:47.306
And what, with the money
and the exposure at stake,

09:47.307 --> 09:50.132
winning one of the majors
can launch a career.

09:50.133 --> 09:52.837
What about a boyfriend?
Was she in a relationship?

09:52.838 --> 09:54.832
No boyfriends.
That is a rule for my clients,

09:54.833 --> 09:56.400
and Amber was no exception.

09:56.401 --> 09:59.418
She knew that she needed to
focus 100% of her energy

09:59.419 --> 10:00.630
on the pageant.

10:00.631 --> 10:03.608
You know, the night that she
died, she got into an argument.

10:03.609 --> 10:05.010
Any idea with who?

10:05.011 --> 10:08.083
No. The last time I saw her
was before her dinner.

10:08.084 --> 10:09.908
But like I told that other detective,

10:09.909 --> 10:11.825
something was going on.

10:11.826 --> 10:13.053
How so?

10:13.054 --> 10:16.493
She'd been off the last
couple of days, upset.

10:16.494 --> 10:18.890
And I went to pick her up
for a costume fitting,

10:19.008 --> 10:21.555
and it looked like she had been crying.

10:22.638 --> 10:23.800
Did you ask why?

10:23.801 --> 10:26.288
She said that someone was trying
to take advantage of her.

10:26.289 --> 10:29.006
I asked her who, but she
said she would handle it.

10:29.007 --> 10:32.221
It j--it wasn't like her
not to confide in me.

10:32.817 --> 10:35.355
Could it have been one of
the other contestants?

10:35.890 --> 10:38.253
There's a lot of pressure
on these girls to win.

10:38.525 --> 10:42.227
And it can get really...
"political" between them.

10:42.922 --> 10:45.315
Do you think it's possible
political turned deadly?

10:45.316 --> 10:48.079
I don't know.
Winning means fame and fortune.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.881
No one remembers the runner-up.

10:49.882 --> 10:51.548
Besides, people have killed for less.

10:51.549 --> 10:54.729
- That still doesn't explain who
she was arguing with. - Guys.

10:54.730 --> 10:56.122
I got something.

10:58.043 --> 10:59.392
One of the girls?

10:59.393 --> 11:02.504
Just watch.
Ever since I was a little girl...

11:02.505 --> 11:04.932
This is from Baron's dinner last night.

11:04.933 --> 11:06.567
That's our victim, Amber.

11:06.568 --> 11:08.409
And I just feel so very honored to be here.

11:08.410 --> 11:10.456
She's laying it on thick for Victor Baron.

11:10.457 --> 11:13.336
But that's not the interesting part.

11:15.702 --> 11:16.997
Now watch this.

11:20.697 --> 11:22.217
Ah. There.

11:22.218 --> 11:23.212
See that?

11:23.213 --> 11:24.607
Look at her face.

11:24.608 --> 11:27.160
Looks like whatever good-guy
sitcom star Bobby Stark said,

11:27.161 --> 11:30.037
she didn't like it.
Don't just look at her face.

11:30.358 --> 11:31.802
Look at his tux.

11:35.887 --> 11:37.412
Black sequins.

11:51.328 --> 11:52.321
Yo.

11:53.338 --> 11:54.854
Bobby Stark's blazer,

11:54.855 --> 11:56.623
courtesy of the costume
lady at the pageant.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.678
And the broken black sequin? 
Perfect match.

11:58.679 --> 12:00.628
Bam, said the costume lady.

12:00.629 --> 12:03.056
Ooh, she's not the only lady saying bam

12:03.057 --> 12:05.152
when it comes to Bobby Stark.
Does he have a record?

12:05.153 --> 12:06.313
Uh, no criminal charges,

12:06.314 --> 12:08.693
but Mr. Stark has quite the reputation.

12:08.694 --> 12:12.054
Three women filed restraining
orders against Bobby Stark

12:12.055 --> 12:15.568
in the last year, all
for unwanted advances.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.125
How come I didn't hear about this on "TMZ"?

12:17.126 --> 12:18.595
Oh, word is Stark paid

12:18.596 --> 12:20.435
quite a bit of cash to make it all go away.

12:20.436 --> 12:22.459
Oh, it gets better.
I was talking to Candace Ford

12:22.460 --> 12:23.596
and a couple of the other girls.

12:23.597 --> 12:25.869
They said that Bobby
Stark had started paying

12:25.870 --> 12:28.090
quite a lot of attention to Amber.

12:28.091 --> 12:30.124
Maybe it was unwanted attention.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.205
Maybe Bobby didn't know how
to take no for an answer.

12:34.230 --> 12:36.079
You lookin' at me? Hmm?

12:36.080 --> 12:38.367
You lookin' at me?
Mr. Stark, I'm detective--

12:38.368 --> 12:40.364
Nobody else around.
You must be lookin' at me.

12:40.365 --> 12:41.963
Mr. Stark. 
Hmm?

12:41.964 --> 12:44.747
Have a seat, please. Yeah.
Hey, you like that bit?

12:45.390 --> 12:47.101
That's my, uh, Bobby de Niro.

12:47.102 --> 12:50.529
Playing a homicidal maniac.
Sold it though, right?

12:50.530 --> 12:53.623
See, I got this range as an actor.

12:53.624 --> 12:55.265
You probably don't know about
that because I'm always typecast

12:55.266 --> 12:57.372
as Mr. Nice-Guy Dad. 
Yeah,

12:57.373 --> 12:58.594
well, I don't think
you'll have that problem

12:58.595 --> 13:00.130
now that you're a murder suspect.

13:00.387 --> 13:03.029
Murder suspect? What?
Is she joking? You joking?

13:03.030 --> 13:04.914
What was your relationship
with Amber Middleberry?

13:04.915 --> 13:07.385
Oh, come on. Are you serious?
I didn't kill her.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.018
If anything, I was trying to recruit her.

13:09.019 --> 13:12.397
Recruit her? For what?
Yeah, for my, uh, Goddess Train.

13:12.398 --> 13:15.350
The Goddess Train?
It's my own little private pageant.

13:15.974 --> 13:19.421
And how did Amber respond to
this oh-so-enticing offer?

13:19.422 --> 13:20.991
You know what?
She hadn't seen the light yet,

13:20.992 --> 13:22.248
but she was coming around.

13:22.674 --> 13:25.215
I could always tell the
innocent act when I see it.

13:25.216 --> 13:26.978
Besides, who wouldn't want
to ride the Bobby rocket?

13:26.979 --> 13:28.493
Everyone from what we hear.

13:28.494 --> 13:29.910
Mr. Stark, here's what I think happened--

13:29.911 --> 13:32.709
After dinner, you invited Amber
back to your dressing room,

13:32.710 --> 13:34.640
and she had the bad sense to agree.

13:34.641 --> 13:36.450
And that's when you tried
to make another pitch

13:36.451 --> 13:39.498
to get her on board your Goddess Train.
When she shot you down,

13:39.499 --> 13:41.200
you flew into a rage and you strangled her.

13:41.201 --> 13:43.794
You were rehearsing on that stage all week.

13:43.795 --> 13:45.669
You knew all of the equipment--
Just stop.

13:45.670 --> 13:46.751
Would you just--just stop?

13:46.752 --> 13:47.785
You guys are crazy, you know that?

13:47.786 --> 13:49.305
Okay, well, then maybe you can explain

13:49.306 --> 13:53.600
why we found this broken
sequin from your jacket

13:53.601 --> 13:55.358
on her body.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.731
Where were you between 11:00 
and 1:00 A.M. last night?

14:00.732 --> 14:03.094
Uh... I don't know.

14:03.095 --> 14:04.715
I'm a little foggy on that, actually.

14:04.716 --> 14:07.655
I was, uh, partying pretty hard.
Who were you with?

14:07.656 --> 14:10.128
I'm not sure, but...

14:10.601 --> 14:13.115
Whoever it was, we were
definitely using strawberry oil.

14:13.116 --> 14:14.664
Okay, so let me get this straight.

14:15.097 --> 14:17.215
You don't remember where you were

14:17.216 --> 14:19.309
or what you were doing last night?

14:23.366 --> 14:25.076
That's bad, right?

14:29.265 --> 14:32.238
That guy's dropped more pills
than a 3-fingered pharmacist.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.151
I just can't believe
that someone who's given

14:34.152 --> 14:37.215
so much great fatherly advice on
TV could be guilty of murder.

14:37.216 --> 14:38.506
Well, he's a drug-addled predator

14:38.507 --> 14:40.304
who left physical evidence on the body.

14:41.516 --> 14:42.676
Well, when you put it that way...

14:42.677 --> 14:43.817
Hey, Esposito. 
Yo.

14:43.818 --> 14:45.477
We need to reconstruct Stark's evening.

14:45.478 --> 14:47.876
Check his phone records,
double-check security cameras

14:47.877 --> 14:49.065
at the hotel.

14:49.066 --> 14:51.929
We need hard evidence to place
him at the crime scene.

14:51.930 --> 14:53.489
I got something that might help.

14:58.355 --> 15:00.165
Amber had her violin with her at dinner,

15:00.166 --> 15:01.272
but it wasn't with the body

15:01.273 --> 15:03.866
or anywhere at the crime scene.
So where'd it go?

15:03.867 --> 15:05.233
Well, we know Amber went to the hotel,

15:05.234 --> 15:06.845
so maybe she dropped it off there.

15:06.846 --> 15:09.236
Except uniforms inventoried the room.
It wasn't there,

15:09.237 --> 15:11.164
and her dad and consultant
didn't see it either.

15:11.165 --> 15:12.552
So maybe she had it when she was killed.

15:12.553 --> 15:13.751
And Bobby Stark disposed of it.

15:13.752 --> 15:16.008
Check trash cans, dumpsters,
and sewer drains by the hotel.

15:16.009 --> 15:17.094
If someone saw him ditch the violin,

15:17.095 --> 15:18.724
we can connect him to the murder. 
Right on.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.704
Oh, beauty pageant intrigue.

15:28.285 --> 15:29.885
Some things never change. 
Ah!

15:29.886 --> 15:31.549
Oh, here it is.

15:35.012 --> 15:38.155
I didn't know you competed.
Well, that's because I didn't win.

15:38.156 --> 15:40.146
Oh. But I will tell you, the
women I competed against--

15:40.147 --> 15:43.347
Just as cutthroat as they are now.
What was your talent?

15:43.595 --> 15:45.032
The way I wore a sweater.

15:46.540 --> 15:49.618
Hi, honey. 
Hey, Alexis.

15:51.975 --> 15:52.936
What's wrong?

15:52.937 --> 15:54.434
Ashley made his decision.

15:54.435 --> 15:55.841
Uh-oh.

15:57.034 --> 15:58.235
Stanford?

15:58.236 --> 15:59.100
No.

15:59.942 --> 16:03.076
He decided to go to
school here in New York.

16:03.389 --> 16:04.834
What's not good about that?

16:04.835 --> 16:06.605
Stanford was his dream.

16:06.606 --> 16:08.108
I don't want to stand in the way of that.

16:08.109 --> 16:09.638
He'll just end up hating me for it.

16:09.639 --> 16:11.455
And this could be the most
important decision of his life,

16:11.456 --> 16:17.680
so I made a decision, too.
I broke up with him.

16:21.322 --> 16:22.784
Oh, baby.

16:23.588 --> 16:25.552
No, it's okay.

16:29.253 --> 16:30.029
Well, she's right, you know?

16:30.030 --> 16:31.245
I mean, odds are, it won't work out.

16:31.246 --> 16:33.786
She's just being practical.
Relationships aren't math problems.

16:33.787 --> 16:36.118
You don't solve them by being practical.

16:36.119 --> 16:37.700
I mean, what happens when
she meets her soul mate,

16:37.701 --> 16:40.462
but she doesn't risk it
because it's not practical?

16:40.661 --> 16:44.444
Okay, then what about Hawaii? Earrings?

16:44.445 --> 16:46.557
Ooh. Lingerie?

16:46.558 --> 16:49.406
Things you buy a woman.
I used to kill on "Pyramid."

16:49.407 --> 16:50.597
It's my 30th anniversary.

16:50.598 --> 16:52.083
Oh, sir, congratulations.

16:52.084 --> 16:55.027
30 years of marriage, and you
don't know what to buy her?

16:55.028 --> 16:56.587
If you stayed married
long enough, you'd know,

16:56.588 --> 16:59.153
it's hard to stay original
after the first ten.

16:59.154 --> 17:01.466
That's fair.
So what's the secret to your success?

17:01.467 --> 17:02.644
There's no secret. Just...

17:03.060 --> 17:04.593
Keep showing up.

17:06.724 --> 17:08.106
Any luck on Bobby Stark?

17:08.107 --> 17:09.479
Yeah, but you're not gonna like it.

17:09.480 --> 17:10.892
Paparazzi snapped photos of him

17:10.893 --> 17:12.557
going into the Tribeca Grand Hotel

17:12.558 --> 17:15.617
at 11:30 with a brunette 
wearing Jackie O. Glasses.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.785
At 1:00 A.M., he left, at which point

17:17.786 --> 17:20.809
he relocated to a gentlemen's
club to watch mud wrestling.

17:20.810 --> 17:22.228
Amber left her room at 11:00.

17:22.229 --> 17:23.665
Where was he between 11:00 and 11:30?

17:23.666 --> 17:25.039
In a cab on his way to Tribeca.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.058
And we know this for a fact?

17:27.059 --> 17:29.369
Yeah, he was tweeting photos
of his manhood along the way.

17:29.370 --> 17:31.122
And that's how you trend on Twitter.

17:31.222 --> 17:32.274
So the sequin must have broken off

17:32.275 --> 17:34.299
onto Amber after he bumped up against her.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.715
Cut him loose. He's not our guy. 
Right.

17:36.072 --> 17:39.981
Which means we are dead in the water.
I wouldn't go that far.

17:39.982 --> 17:42.264
Her stolen violin? We found it.

17:42.372 --> 17:44.589
- Where? 
- Dumped in a garbage bin behind the hotel.

17:44.675 --> 17:46.188
Disposed of by our killer,

17:46.189 --> 17:48.486
just not the killer we thought.
Did we get prints?

17:48.487 --> 17:50.316
Yeah, Amber Middleberry's

17:50.418 --> 17:52.425
and one other set belonging to the lovely,

17:52.426 --> 17:53.852
the talented...

17:53.951 --> 17:56.264
Contestant from Georgia.

17:56.265 --> 17:58.444
Which one was... Oh.

17:58.586 --> 18:01.411
Amber and I have been friends
since little Miss Spangles.

18:01.412 --> 18:02.906
Why would you think I killed her?

18:02.907 --> 18:05.543
Because your prints were all
over the violin case, Joy.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.001
And she had it with her when she came back

18:07.002 --> 18:08.721
from dinner last night.

18:08.722 --> 18:10.886
I held it for her while
she fixed her tights.

18:10.887 --> 18:12.594
They were on the violin, too.

18:17.648 --> 18:20.541
She wasn't even supposed
to be a semifinalist,

18:20.542 --> 18:22.442
but then she nailed all
her pageant questions.

18:22.443 --> 18:23.936
It was supposed to be her weakness,

18:23.937 --> 18:27.460
but she blew everyone away.
She was going to win.

18:27.578 --> 18:29.057
So then you killed her and
you dumped her violin.

18:29.164 --> 18:30.976
No, that is not what happened.

18:30.977 --> 18:33.113
Last night when we went back
to the hotel, I saw her

18:33.114 --> 18:35.320
go into her room, drop off her
stuff, and then leave again.

18:35.321 --> 18:37.483
But she left so fast, her door
didn't close all the way,

18:37.484 --> 18:40.850
so I went to shut it, and
that's when I saw her violin.

18:41.375 --> 18:44.608
She just left it there. It was like a sign.

18:46.051 --> 18:46.920
I thought...

18:47.760 --> 18:51.205
Joy Jones, how badly do you want this?

18:52.237 --> 18:54.760
How badly did you want it?

18:55.640 --> 18:57.329
More than anything.

18:58.645 --> 19:00.020
I'm 25.

19:00.490 --> 19:01.774
I'm old.

19:01.980 --> 19:03.985
This is the last year I can qualify.

19:03.986 --> 19:06.028
I thought if I took her violin,
it might throw her off enough

19:06.029 --> 19:08.042
in the talent finals that I could beat her.

19:08.143 --> 19:10.877
But that wasn't enough for you, was it?
You thought,

19:10.878 --> 19:13.084
why not just take Amber out
of the contest completely?

19:13.085 --> 19:15.529
No. All I did was take her violin,

19:15.530 --> 19:17.495
and when I found out she
was dead, I panicked.

19:17.801 --> 19:20.469
I thought someone might find
out, so I threw it away.

19:20.470 --> 19:22.269
That's a pretty good act, Joy,

19:22.270 --> 19:24.723
but the judges just aren't buying it.

19:24.724 --> 19:27.394
No, I swear. I didn't have to kill Amber

19:27.395 --> 19:29.355
to get her out of the pageant.

19:29.459 --> 19:32.054
I found something in her violin case,

19:32.244 --> 19:33.741
something awful.

19:33.742 --> 19:35.409
And what did you find?

19:35.410 --> 19:37.408
The reason she was murdered.

19:40.118 --> 19:42.336
If these got out, it would've ruined her.

19:42.337 --> 19:45.257
She would've been kicked
off the circuit for good.

19:50.524 --> 19:51.781
Oh, my God.

19:51.782 --> 19:54.068
She is absolutely, totally...

19:54.069 --> 19:56.835
Naked. There's a note on
the back of that one.

19:58.694 --> 20:00.726
"You know my price.
Pay up or I will destroy you."

20:00.727 --> 20:02.488
So she was being blackmailed.

20:02.489 --> 20:04.436
Looks like somebody made
good on their threat.

20:12.248 --> 20:14.276
Beauty queens and naked pictures--

20:14.277 --> 20:16.156
as American as socialites and sex tapes.

20:16.157 --> 20:18.383
Amber dreamt of winning this pageant,

20:18.384 --> 20:19.867
why would she take those photos?

20:19.868 --> 20:21.984
I mean, she knew the chance
that she was taking.

20:21.985 --> 20:23.363
Well, just because you're
smart and beautiful

20:23.364 --> 20:24.855
doesn't mean you have good judgment.

20:25.519 --> 20:26.998
I didn't mean me.

20:27.752 --> 20:29.548
Just got off with Amber's father.

20:29.549 --> 20:31.396
That was a tough conversation.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.037
You mean, he didn't know about the photos?

20:33.038 --> 20:35.166
And Amber didn't tell him
about the blackmailer either

20:35.348 --> 20:36.754
or try to borrow money.

20:36.755 --> 20:38.887
Well, maybe she paid off the
blackmailer on her own.

20:38.888 --> 20:41.689
Not an option. Any money Amber did have

20:41.690 --> 20:44.639
went to paying for shoes,
gowns, and spray tans.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.565
She only had 50 bucks in the bank.

20:46.566 --> 20:48.207
And she didn't have any
recent withdrawals either.

20:48.208 --> 20:50.377
Justin said that she was upset.
Maybe that's because

20:50.378 --> 20:51.921
she didn't have the money
to make it go away.

20:51.922 --> 20:53.093
Yeah, but then why kill her?

20:53.094 --> 20:54.858
I mean, a smart blackmailer
would give her the time

20:54.859 --> 20:57.245
to get the cash.
Not if she threatened to go to the police,

20:57.246 --> 20:58.974
forcing him to take deadly action.

20:58.975 --> 21:03.432
Deadly action-- that's a good title.
I rechecked her phone.

21:03.433 --> 21:05.702
There's no record of any unusual calls.

21:05.703 --> 21:07.130
I figure the blackmailer contacted her

21:07.131 --> 21:09.122
through her hotel phone, that
way he couldn't be traced.

21:09.123 --> 21:11.408
Castle, have you taken a
look at these photos?

21:11.928 --> 21:14.594
Only in so far as it pertains
to the investigation.

21:14.595 --> 21:16.158
Look at the lighting and the composition.

21:16.159 --> 21:19.093
Whoever took these knew
something about photography.

21:19.094 --> 21:21.618
A professional.
I mean, it happens all the time.

21:21.619 --> 21:24.315
Girl gets a session with a
pro, they finish, he offers

21:24.316 --> 21:26.304
to take a few art shots, she's
desperate for the cash,

21:26.305 --> 21:28.011
he promises he'll never
show it to anybody...

21:28.012 --> 21:29.307
Until she makes it big, in which case,

21:29.308 --> 21:31.380
they suddenly surface.
Esposito,

21:31.381 --> 21:33.556
let's get ahold of the pageant consultant.

21:33.557 --> 21:35.393
Let's get a list of all the photographers

21:35.394 --> 21:36.647
that Amber's had sessions with.

21:36.648 --> 21:38.828
One of them might be our blackmailer.
All right.

21:39.100 --> 21:40.981
This must have been what
she was so upset about.

21:40.982 --> 21:45.234
She knew, if the pageant found
out, it would've all been over.

21:45.235 --> 21:48.127
It is all over.
But why didn't she just tell me?

21:49.409 --> 21:50.373
Do you have any idea

21:50.374 --> 21:51.804
who might have taken these photographs?

21:51.805 --> 21:54.672
With that hairstyle, it must
have been six months ago.

21:54.673 --> 21:56.434
I'll have to check my calendar.

21:58.110 --> 21:59.071
So uniforms talked

21:59.072 --> 22:01.594
to the pageant girls that
Amber was closest to.

22:01.595 --> 22:03.299
She didn't tell them
about the photos either.

22:03.300 --> 22:04.949
Well, she probably thought
they'd use it against her.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.417
Beckett, you're a woman, right?

22:06.418 --> 22:08.651
Sir, I have no idea what to get your wife.

22:08.652 --> 22:09.833
Still no luck on the gift?

22:09.834 --> 22:11.166
Keep coming up empty.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.913
The best thing to give a woman
is something she said she wanted

22:13.914 --> 22:15.785
when she didn't think you were listening.

22:16.637 --> 22:18.382
What if I wasn't listening?

22:18.383 --> 22:19.977
Gift certificate?

22:21.043 --> 22:22.283
Beckett.

22:23.178 --> 22:24.836
So according to her pageant consultant,

22:24.837 --> 22:27.412
Amber was in the city about six
months ago for a photo shoot.

22:27.413 --> 22:29.240
He thinks they were taken
around the same time.

22:29.241 --> 22:30.566
And who was the shoot with?

22:30.567 --> 22:33.454
A photographer named Dax Lattimer.
Does he have a record?

22:33.455 --> 22:35.209
Negative, but I asked around, and the guy's

22:35.210 --> 22:36.528
no stranger to dirty pictures.

22:36.529 --> 22:39.476
On top of headshots, he also
freelances for adult magazines.

22:39.477 --> 22:41.210
Well, sounds like our guy. 
Where is he now?

22:41.211 --> 22:42.436
He's at a studio in the East Village.

22:42.437 --> 22:44.651
I'm heading there now. 
Okay. I'll have Ryan meet you.

22:45.992 --> 22:49.172
Sure, I remember Amber. Very sweet gal.

22:49.173 --> 22:51.002
I took some headshots for her.

22:51.003 --> 22:52.864
You take anything else
while you were at it?

22:52.865 --> 22:55.199
Maybe some snaps of her
wearing nothing but a smile?

22:55.200 --> 22:58.194
Amber wasn't the type.
She was all about the glamour.

22:58.505 --> 22:59.455
So what's this about?

22:59.456 --> 23:00.881
She was murdered.

23:00.882 --> 23:04.244
And we think whoever killed her
took this picture right here.

23:07.340 --> 23:10.080
Yeah, well, I didn't take this.
I'm not that mediocre.

23:10.198 --> 23:13.277
Really? These were shot around
the time you worked with Amber.

23:13.278 --> 23:15.598
And we all know you do more
than just pets and families.

23:15.599 --> 23:17.138
Hey, we all have to pay the bills.

23:17.139 --> 23:19.118
And with Amber's star on the rise,

23:19.119 --> 23:22.286
that photo's worth some serious coin.
Pretty girl like that,

23:22.287 --> 23:23.905
alone here with you in the studio?

23:23.906 --> 23:26.190
Hey, you have to believe me.
I didn't take this photograph.

23:26.191 --> 23:28.641
- Besides, we weren't alone.
She was with someone. - Who?

23:28.765 --> 23:30.550
Some boyfriend. 
The guy was a real creep, too.

23:30.551 --> 23:32.044
Amber didn't have a boyfriend.

23:32.045 --> 23:33.430
Well, she did when she was here.

23:33.431 --> 23:36.212
In fact, he fancied himself a
photographer, kept telling me

23:36.213 --> 23:38.016
I should shoot Amber in natural light.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.606
This boyfriend have a name?

23:39.607 --> 23:42.322
Jerry. Jeremy. Something like that.

23:42.323 --> 23:44.466
Mr. Lattimer, where were
you night before last

23:44.467 --> 23:47.604
between 11:00 P.M. and 1:00 A.M.? 
At home with my wife,

23:47.605 --> 23:50.029
trying to rock my colicky son to sleep.

23:50.030 --> 23:51.715
It's a doorman building, so you can check.

23:51.716 --> 23:53.218
Okay, thanks.

23:53.683 --> 23:56.376
Amber's dad said that she
used to have a boyfriend--

23:56.377 --> 23:58.311
Jeremy Keiper.

23:58.312 --> 24:00.905
Keiper? Was he creepy?
Yeah, well, her dad thought so.

24:00.906 --> 24:02.972
As far as he knows, they
broke up late last year

24:02.973 --> 24:05.780
because she realized that
he was holding her back.

24:05.781 --> 24:06.948
The dad thinks that the boyfriend's

24:06.949 --> 24:09.612
still in Illinois.
Well, that's the beauty of blackmail--

24:09.613 --> 24:13.324
You can do it from anywhere.
Blackmail, maybe. But not murder.

24:13.325 --> 24:15.536
Why don't we find out if Keiper
paid her a visit lately?

24:15.537 --> 24:16.604
On it.

24:18.229 --> 24:20.033
Bad boyfriends and pageant queens?

24:20.034 --> 24:23.545
This is like Debbie Winokur all over again.

24:23.546 --> 24:24.792
You having flashbacks?

24:24.793 --> 24:26.587
It was my own private Vietnam.

24:27.107 --> 24:29.781
Our place smelled of hair spray,

24:29.782 --> 24:32.556
perfume, and cigarettes.

24:33.435 --> 24:35.808
I'm surprised that we didn't
spontaneously combust.

24:35.809 --> 24:37.993
I love the smell of hair
spray in the morning.

24:38.592 --> 24:41.121
It smells like... victory.

24:41.868 --> 24:43.731
Excuse me, Mr. Castle?

24:45.788 --> 24:47.192
Ashley.

24:47.346 --> 24:49.447
I'm sorry to bug you at work,
but Alexis established

24:49.448 --> 24:52.166
a-a no calls, no contact policy.
She told me.

24:52.167 --> 24:54.152
Look, I-I made a big mistake.

24:54.153 --> 24:55.484
I thought if I chose Stanford,

24:55.485 --> 24:57.883
A-Alexis would think that
I was blowing her off.

24:57.962 --> 24:59.761
I-instead, she's mad at
me because I chose her

24:59.762 --> 25:01.325
over where I want to go to school.

25:01.436 --> 25:04.057
So now I'm going to Stanford,
which is where I wanted to go

25:04.058 --> 25:06.292
in the first place, but-- but if
you call her and tell her that,

25:06.293 --> 25:07.762
she'll be even angrier with you for

25:07.763 --> 25:10.586
ignoring her boundaries. 
Exactly. Look, I think Alexis and I

25:10.587 --> 25:12.125
can make the whole
long-distance thing work.

25:12.126 --> 25:15.028
I really do. Would you tell her that?

25:15.029 --> 25:16.685
Would you talk to her for me?

25:17.007 --> 25:19.862
Ashley, I-I appreciate, it was
probably very hard for you

25:19.863 --> 25:21.430
to come down and talk to me today,

25:21.431 --> 25:24.565
but I just don't think it's very
appropriate for me to get--

25:24.566 --> 25:27.326
Mr. Castle, have you ever
been crazy about someone

25:27.327 --> 25:29.302
who was determined to push you away?

25:29.303 --> 25:32.193
Hey, Castle, uh...
Oh, sorry, guys.

25:32.949 --> 25:33.869
Uh...

25:34.100 --> 25:36.116
No, it...

25:36.592 --> 25:37.884
It's o--um...

25:38.414 --> 25:41.020
Ashley, I'm--I'm sorry. I do have to go.

25:41.021 --> 25:43.353
Please just, um, think about it, okay?

25:43.354 --> 25:44.307
Okay.

25:49.492 --> 25:50.880
What's that about?

25:51.342 --> 25:53.586
He wants me to advocate for him.

25:54.031 --> 25:56.148
Oh. Well, that's sweet.

25:56.149 --> 25:58.267
Yeah. And awkward.

25:58.569 --> 26:00.378
Mostly awkward. 
Yo, Beckett!

26:00.866 --> 26:03.270
I just got off the phone
with Jeremy Keiper's mom.

26:03.491 --> 26:06.033
Turns out Jeremy moved
to New York last month,

26:06.034 --> 26:09.242
said he was going to "make
something of himself."

26:09.243 --> 26:12.064
Looks like he made himself into
a blackmailer and a killer.

26:13.192 --> 26:15.964
Jeremy keiper, NYPD. Open up.

26:29.762 --> 26:31.169
Mr. Keiper?

26:31.948 --> 26:33.497
Anybody here?

26:34.748 --> 26:35.839
Beckett.

26:38.044 --> 26:40.069
Looks like someone had a
hard time letting go.

26:45.607 --> 26:46.633
Castle.

27:03.025 --> 27:05.693
This is a classic murder-suicide.

27:05.694 --> 27:07.221
Jeremy blackmails his ex-girlfriend,

27:07.222 --> 27:08.131
not because he needs the money,

27:08.132 --> 27:10.021
but because clearly,
he's obsessed with her.

27:10.022 --> 27:12.306
Amber rejects him and his scheme-y schemes.

27:12.307 --> 27:14.399
He flips, he snaps, he kills her, and then,

27:14.400 --> 27:17.030
faced with the reality of what
he's done, hangs himself.

27:17.031 --> 27:21.224
- Only one problem with your
theory, Castle. - Which is?

27:21.225 --> 27:23.237
This wasn't a suicide. 
This wasn't?

27:23.238 --> 27:24.359
If he'd hanged himself,

27:24.360 --> 27:26.522
the marks on his neck would angle upwards.

27:26.523 --> 27:29.917
Yes, which they do.
Yes, but if he was strangled,

27:29.918 --> 27:32.286
the marks would go straight across.
This guy's got both.

27:32.287 --> 27:34.760
Then the hanging was a cover
up for the strangulation.

27:34.761 --> 27:36.438
Well, there's also peri-mortem bruising

27:36.439 --> 27:38.232
on the arms and across the ribs.

27:38.233 --> 27:40.869
I'm guessing there was a struggle.
Estimated time of death?

27:40.870 --> 27:43.019
Well, judging by temperature and lividity,

27:43.020 --> 27:46.615
- he was killed half a day before
Amber Middleberry. - Before Amber?

27:46.616 --> 27:48.768
Yes, before!

27:48.769 --> 27:51.745
Now can you please move?
You're in my light.

27:52.121 --> 27:55.251
This doesn't make any sense.
If he didn't kill Amber...

27:56.131 --> 27:59.614
How do a blackmailer and his
victim both end up dead?

27:59.615 --> 28:01.366
Yo, check this out.

28:02.119 --> 28:03.629
His hard drive's been wiped.

28:03.740 --> 28:06.136
That's our connection, Castle.
It's the one thing

28:06.137 --> 28:08.450
that Amber and Jeremy had in common...
those photos.

28:08.451 --> 28:10.511
Someone didn't want them
to see the light of day.

28:13.174 --> 28:16.400
Amber's dad had no idea this was
going on with his daughter.

28:16.401 --> 28:19.278
She didn't even mention Jeremy's
name in the last six months.

28:19.542 --> 28:20.992
Is there anything else
that Jeremy and Amber

28:20.993 --> 28:22.238
could've been involved with while

28:22.239 --> 28:24.344
they were together?
No, not that he can recall.

28:24.818 --> 28:26.599
These pictures, by today's standards,

28:26.600 --> 28:28.428
are--are downright tasteful.

28:28.523 --> 28:30.996
How do these get you killed?
It can't be about naked pictures.

28:30.997 --> 28:34.005
Something else must have been going on.
Unless...

28:34.006 --> 28:37.313
- Unless what? 
- Unless Jeremy wasn't the only blackmailer.

28:37.314 --> 28:39.877
What if he had a partner?
I mean, we know Amber

28:39.878 --> 28:41.615
was arguing with someone
the night she was killed.

28:41.616 --> 28:42.635
We know it couldn't have been Jeremy,

28:42.636 --> 28:45.693
because he was already dead.
Why would the partner kill Jeremy?

28:45.694 --> 28:47.007
Maybe they had a falling out.

28:47.008 --> 28:49.509
Maybe Jeremy decided he
couldn't hurt Amber,

28:49.510 --> 28:51.134
but the partner still wanted his payday.

28:51.135 --> 28:52.549
So he takes out Jeremy and decides

28:52.550 --> 28:55.826
to go after Amber himself?
But Amber decides to call his bluff.

28:55.827 --> 28:57.273
She says she's gonna contact the police.

28:57.274 --> 29:00.046
Now the blackmailer has no choice.
He has to kill her

29:00.047 --> 29:02.169
and get rid of all the
evidence of blackmail.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.704
Ryan.

29:06.129 --> 29:08.229
Give me everything you
got on Jeremy Keiper.

29:09.810 --> 29:11.172
I'm sorry, baby.

29:12.154 --> 29:14.696
Whoa. It's late. I'll leave you to it.

29:21.890 --> 29:22.700
Hey.

29:22.701 --> 29:23.560
Hey.

29:24.191 --> 29:25.352
Whatcha looking at?

29:34.774 --> 29:36.482
You really miss him, don't ya?

29:39.894 --> 29:41.950
You know I-I hate to interfere--

29:42.223 --> 29:43.547
Since when?

29:43.962 --> 29:45.257
Point taken.

29:46.390 --> 29:49.148
Ashley dropped by the
precinct to see me today.

29:49.149 --> 29:50.930
He did? Why?

29:50.931 --> 29:53.588
He wanted me to intercede on his behalf.

29:54.240 --> 29:55.441
What'd he say?

29:55.442 --> 29:57.622
Well, he looked about as happy as you do,

29:59.107 --> 30:00.360
and he wanted me to tell you

30:00.361 --> 30:02.331
that he has decided to go to Stanford.

30:04.183 --> 30:05.230
Oh.

30:05.592 --> 30:06.640
And...

30:07.751 --> 30:10.149
He wants to give a
long-distance relationship

30:10.150 --> 30:11.531
a shot.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.267
He thinks it could work.

30:15.651 --> 30:17.250
What do you think?

30:22.204 --> 30:24.166
I think that nothing is certain.

30:25.337 --> 30:26.703
And you could be ending something

30:26.704 --> 30:28.550
that might have worked if you had just...

30:29.001 --> 30:30.785
Given it a little more time.

30:30.979 --> 30:32.300
What if I'm just cutting my losses

30:32.301 --> 30:34.391
on something that was never meant to be?

30:34.723 --> 30:36.567
Well, then we can be the
father-daughter version

30:36.568 --> 30:37.953
of "Grey Gardens."

30:39.732 --> 30:41.736
Life is a journey,

30:41.737 --> 30:44.901
and there is no predicting the outcome.

30:45.281 --> 30:47.343
The only thing you can
control are your choices,

30:47.344 --> 30:51.459
and they'll... they'll define who you are.

30:51.662 --> 30:53.500
I would just hate to see you so focused

30:53.501 --> 30:54.806
on the problem right in front of you

30:54.898 --> 30:58.982
that you...
completely miss the entire picture.

31:01.225 --> 31:03.217
That's pretty good advice.

31:04.297 --> 31:07.344
Yeah. Yeah, actually it is, isn't it?

31:07.345 --> 31:08.355
Yeah.

31:13.087 --> 31:14.555
Remind me to get you a subscription

31:14.556 --> 31:17.655
to a girlie magazine for Christmas.
Oh, that is so thoughtful,

31:17.656 --> 31:19.522
but I'm not looking at the naked girl.

31:19.704 --> 31:20.594
What are you looking at?

31:20.595 --> 31:22.597
Everything but the naked girl.

31:22.679 --> 31:24.381
We were so focused on Amber,

31:24.382 --> 31:26.119
we almost missed the entire picture.

31:26.120 --> 31:28.578
What if Amber and Jeremy
were killed not because of

31:28.579 --> 31:30.120
who was in this photo, but because of

31:30.121 --> 31:33.780
where the photo was taken?
Anything look familiar?

31:35.468 --> 31:36.684
Sure does.

31:37.242 --> 31:38.783
You can thank me later.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.008
Talk about a motive for murder.

31:49.009 --> 31:50.625
If these photos got out to the tabloids...

31:50.626 --> 31:51.477
It would destroy everything.

31:51.478 --> 31:52.593
NYPD.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.604
The memorial for Amber should
be simple, tasteful...

31:57.605 --> 31:59.510
And very, very classy. 
Yes.

32:00.814 --> 32:01.959
Detective.

32:02.345 --> 32:03.879
Is there something I can help you with?

32:03.880 --> 32:06.194
Yes, we need to ask you a few questions.

32:06.195 --> 32:07.212
Ask away.

32:08.022 --> 32:09.018
Fine.

32:09.777 --> 32:10.852
Tell us about the blackmail

32:10.853 --> 32:12.929
and the murder of Amber Middleberry.

32:13.181 --> 32:15.706
Shut the cameras off. Go, now!

32:18.545 --> 32:21.027
I thought you said that
everybody loves the underbelly.

32:21.028 --> 32:22.593
This--
What's going on, Victor?

32:22.594 --> 32:25.181
What's going on is, we
finally figured out who,

32:25.182 --> 32:26.710
aside from Amber...

32:27.033 --> 32:30.073
would be nervous about these photos.
What photos?

32:30.647 --> 32:33.397
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Victor.

32:33.398 --> 32:35.845
Oh, my God! 
I-it's not what it looks like.

32:35.846 --> 32:37.489
It's not what it looks like? 
This is...

32:38.080 --> 32:40.018
This is our house in the Hamptons.

32:40.019 --> 32:42.620
This is our bed. It's our vacation bed.

32:42.621 --> 32:45.354
Right underneath the $2-million Picard that

32:45.355 --> 32:47.275
you purchased at the auction,
which just happens to be

32:47.276 --> 32:48.508
the companion to this painting

32:48.509 --> 32:50.103
here in your office. We read all about it

32:50.104 --> 32:52.451
on the spread they did on
you in "Today's Architect."

32:52.452 --> 32:55.776
Looks as though you were
hoisted on your own Picard.

32:56.304 --> 32:58.974
I can explain. 
We agreed, Victor. Never again.

32:58.975 --> 33:00.542
It was just a weekend.

33:00.543 --> 33:02.850
Just a weekend?
I have friends in the Hamptons.

33:02.851 --> 33:04.864
What if somebody saw?
I won't be humiliated

33:04.865 --> 33:07.398
because you can't keep it in your pants!
No one saw.

33:07.399 --> 33:11.251
No one saw. No, you took
photos so everyone could see.

33:11.252 --> 33:13.760
I didn't take those pictures.
Here's what I think happened--

33:13.761 --> 33:15.327
Amber was being blackmailed.

33:15.328 --> 33:17.359
She couldn't pay, so she
came to you for help.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.840
Only you had a lot to
lose, and those pictures,

33:19.841 --> 33:21.489
they have a way of getting out.

33:21.578 --> 33:24.427
So instead of paying off her
blackmailer, you killed him,

33:24.428 --> 33:25.343
and then you came back here

33:25.344 --> 33:26.795
and took care of her.
That's not what happened.

33:26.796 --> 33:30.140
The cameras aren't rolling
any longer, Mr. Baron.

33:30.438 --> 33:32.118
You can drop the act.

33:32.119 --> 33:35.253
It's not an act.
Amber wasn't being blackmailed.

33:35.254 --> 33:37.378
The conniving bitch was blackmailing me.

33:37.379 --> 33:38.762
She was blackmailing you?

33:38.763 --> 33:40.606
She showed me the pictures.
She told me that she had

33:40.719 --> 33:43.107
her boyfriend come and
take 'em while I was away.

33:44.076 --> 33:45.784
Wait. You left her alone in my house?

33:45.785 --> 33:47.709
I had a meeting in the city.
I was coming right back.

33:47.818 --> 33:49.556
How could you be so stupid, Victor?

33:50.593 --> 33:52.338
She said if helped her win the pageant,

33:52.339 --> 33:54.660
the photos would never
see the light of day.

33:54.826 --> 33:57.014
"You know the price.
Pay up or I'll destroy you."

33:57.015 --> 33:59.147
It wasn't to Amber. It was from Amber.

33:59.148 --> 34:00.292
She was still with her boyfriend.

34:00.293 --> 34:03.022
They were in it together.
So then what did you do?

34:03.023 --> 34:04.593
I slipped her the pageant questions.

34:04.594 --> 34:07.855
Why do you think she was doing so well?
You ass!

34:07.956 --> 34:09.943
Whoa! Whoa.
Hey! Hey!

34:10.926 --> 34:13.321
Mr. Baron, where were you
between 11:00 and 1:00 A.M.

34:13.322 --> 34:15.775
the night of the murder?
After the reception,

34:15.860 --> 34:19.268
I had drinks with councilman Bollinger.

34:19.507 --> 34:22.196
Uh, I got home at, uh, at 1:00 A.M.

34:22.197 --> 34:23.947
Kayla was with me, weren't you, babe?

34:24.869 --> 34:27.588
Kayla, is this true? Were you with him?

34:27.589 --> 34:28.014
Oh.

34:33.100 --> 34:34.306
Yes.

34:35.603 --> 34:37.770
Who else knew, Victor?

34:37.771 --> 34:40.572
Who do I need to be ashamed in front of?

34:40.572 --> 34:42.442
No one else knew.
Well, someone else must've,

34:42.443 --> 34:44.268
otherwise two people wouldn't be dead.

34:44.703 --> 34:46.639
The only other person I told was Candace.

34:46.725 --> 34:48.301
I told her what Amber was trying to do--

34:48.302 --> 34:49.809
to me, to the pageant.

34:49.934 --> 34:52.735
I-I-I told her to take care of it,

34:52.819 --> 34:54.043
to make the problem go away.

34:56.556 --> 34:57.980
Maybe she did.

34:58.198 --> 35:00.263
I don't want to see any
fingerprints on those glasses.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.396
Being careful of fingerprints,
are we, Candace?

35:03.166 --> 35:04.721
We want everything to be perfect.

35:04.722 --> 35:06.693
This pageant really is your baby.

35:06.917 --> 35:09.112
You noticed? 17 flawless years.

35:09.113 --> 35:11.747
So then you would do
anything to protect it.

35:13.233 --> 35:15.577
We know that Mr. Baron
told you about the blackmail.

35:16.584 --> 35:19.604
And we know that he asked you to handle it.

35:20.138 --> 35:23.058
Kill her? I wanted to kill Baron.

35:23.059 --> 35:25.835
17 flawless years, and he wants
me to give her the answers

35:25.836 --> 35:27.985
so his little fling can wear the crown?

35:29.659 --> 35:30.428
But it was either that

35:30.429 --> 35:33.127
or that snake destroys everything.

35:33.128 --> 35:36.176
- Where were you the night that
Amber was killed? - Please don't.

35:36.177 --> 35:37.798
Ms. Ford-- 
I was with someone.

35:38.390 --> 35:39.448
Who?

35:40.832 --> 35:42.146
I can't.

35:42.147 --> 35:44.566
Candace, if you have an alibi--
Bobby Stark.

35:44.993 --> 35:47.040
I was with him at the Tribeca Grand.

35:48.716 --> 35:50.293
And the worst part is...

35:51.239 --> 35:52.963
He doesn't even remember.

35:55.602 --> 35:57.950
Tribeca Grand confirms that
Stark was with Candace

35:57.951 --> 35:58.996
at the time of the murder.

35:58.997 --> 36:00.787
She did smell a little
bit like strawberry oil.

36:00.788 --> 36:02.501
Baron's alibi checks out, too.

36:02.714 --> 36:04.172
Which leaves us without a suspect.

36:04.173 --> 36:05.925
Okay, get into it with Baron's lawyers.

36:06.012 --> 36:07.305
Just because Candace didn't kill them

36:07.306 --> 36:09.899
- doesn't mean he didn't hire
someone else to do it. - Right.

36:09.900 --> 36:12.319
Blind, naked ambition--
I think

36:12.320 --> 36:13.939
even your Debbie Winokur
would've been appalled.

36:14.053 --> 36:15.353
Yeah, she would've.

36:15.614 --> 36:17.109
Debbie wanted to be a beauty queen

36:17.110 --> 36:20.407
because she believed in
the ideals of beauty.

36:20.408 --> 36:21.674
She wanted to be beautiful on the

36:21.675 --> 36:24.324
inside and outside.
I thought you didn't like her.

36:24.543 --> 36:27.541
Well, deep down, behind all
of the makeup and the hair,

36:27.542 --> 36:28.898
she wasn't terrible.

36:28.899 --> 36:31.148
She was just a miserable
person to live with.

36:31.149 --> 36:33.735
Unlike Amber, winning wouldn't
have meant a thing to her

36:33.736 --> 36:34.930
if she had to cheat to do it.

36:34.931 --> 36:36.824
Yeah, talk about choices
that change your life.

36:37.198 --> 36:38.163
When do you make that choice?

36:38.268 --> 36:39.083
When does winning become

36:39.084 --> 36:41.443
more important than your soul?
I don't know.

36:41.444 --> 36:43.210
You have to be pretty cold and calculating

36:43.211 --> 36:47.769
to make some of the choices Amber did.
Cold and calculating?

36:48.687 --> 36:49.497
What?

36:49.498 --> 36:51.163
Amber was cold and calculating.

36:51.164 --> 36:52.971
Yeah, so?

36:52.972 --> 36:55.908
So all of those people
we talked to about her,

36:56.295 --> 36:58.224
one of them is lying.

37:30.848 --> 37:34.554
Tragedy... struck the Baron's
all-American pageant

37:34.555 --> 37:38.478
with the untimely passing of
our Illinois All-American,

37:40.035 --> 37:41.864
Ms. Amber Middleberry.

37:42.289 --> 37:45.667
I was fortunate to have
worked closely with Amber.

37:46.408 --> 37:48.030
She meant the world to me.

37:48.031 --> 37:49.701
Well, then why did you kill her?

37:50.256 --> 37:52.809
What? I didn't kill Amber.

37:52.810 --> 37:55.820
You're lying.
You've been lying to us the whole time.

37:55.821 --> 37:57.883
You told us that she was
upset, that she was feeling

37:57.884 --> 38:00.878
like she was being taken
advantage of and threatened.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.123
But she was the one doing the threatening.

38:02.124 --> 38:03.445
There was no reason for her to be upset.

38:03.446 --> 38:05.412
You know, you're interrupting
a dress rehearsal. Okay?

38:05.413 --> 38:07.178
I don't even know what you
two are talking about.

38:07.270 --> 38:09.575
Oh, yes, you do.
You got on to the blackmail.

38:09.576 --> 38:11.621
You thought the old boyfriend
was taking advantage

38:11.622 --> 38:14.512
of your prized client,
so you confronted him.

38:14.513 --> 38:16.216
We ran your credit cards. We know

38:16.217 --> 38:18.510
about the taxi trip you
took to Jeremy's apartment.

38:18.605 --> 38:20.603
So tell us, when you
killed Amber's boyfriend,

38:20.699 --> 38:22.750
did you know that Amber
was in on the scheme?

38:28.091 --> 38:30.794
Justin, stop.

38:30.795 --> 38:31.367
Oh.

38:33.531 --> 38:35.057
Where are you going, aah!

38:44.055 --> 38:45.421
A word of advice, Justin.

38:46.065 --> 38:47.439
When the lady says stop,

38:48.345 --> 38:49.375
stop.

38:52.213 --> 38:53.676
Justin confessed to everything.

38:53.677 --> 38:55.272
His last three clients were losers.

38:55.273 --> 38:57.922
Amber was supposed to be his
comeback, and if she didn't win,

38:57.923 --> 38:58.784
he was through.

38:58.785 --> 39:01.502
Apparently he found the same
naked photos that we did,

39:01.503 --> 39:03.421
thought that her ex-boyfriend
was trying to exploit her.

39:03.422 --> 39:05.425
He was worried, if they called the cops,

39:05.426 --> 39:07.793
that her secret would get out,
and they'd both be ruined.

39:07.794 --> 39:10.743
So he decided to handle it on his own.

39:10.744 --> 39:12.306
Unfortunately, Jeremy was drunk,

39:12.307 --> 39:14.303
he got violent, and Justin
ended up killing him.

39:14.304 --> 39:16.727
And he staged it like it was a suicide.

39:16.728 --> 39:18.745
Once Amber found out, she
threatened to turn him in,

39:18.746 --> 39:21.804
and he killed her.
That's a whole pageant of bad choices.

39:22.220 --> 39:23.303
Good work, you two.

39:24.686 --> 39:27.440
Uh, good work, you all. 
Thank you.

39:27.441 --> 39:30.594
Mm. I see a beauty queen worthy of a crown.

39:30.595 --> 39:33.418
Always the charmer, Rick.
Baby, what you doin' here?

39:33.419 --> 39:34.782
You know I was just comin' to swoop you up.

39:34.783 --> 39:36.527
Yeah, well, I know how you
lose all sense of time

39:36.528 --> 39:39.316
- when you're working.
I figured I'd meet you here. - Mm-hmm.

39:39.404 --> 39:40.797
Do you guys have any big plans?

39:40.798 --> 39:44.868
Dinner and dancing with the
best husband in Manhattan,

39:44.869 --> 39:47.332
especially since he gave
me that gift this morning.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.380
Oh, what did you end up giving her?

39:49.647 --> 39:51.111
I followed your advice, Castle.

39:51.112 --> 39:52.101
I thought about some of the things

39:52.102 --> 39:54.229
Evelyn said she wanted the
past couple of years...

39:55.135 --> 39:56.515
And my gift to her is, next year,

39:56.516 --> 40:00.034
I'm retiring from the force.
We're gonna go traveling.

40:00.035 --> 40:02.489
We're gonna go to all the romantic places.

40:02.594 --> 40:06.244
Wait. Are-- are you serious, boss?
You really want to retire?

40:06.245 --> 40:07.092
I haven't accomplished

40:07.093 --> 40:09.251
everything I wanted to on the
job, but I've done enough.

40:09.252 --> 40:13.443
It's time for me to move on.
Best gift ever--more Roy.

40:13.444 --> 40:14.024
Mm-hmm.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.708
Look, I taught you guys everything I know

40:16.709 --> 40:18.016
about doing this job, all right?

40:18.017 --> 40:19.505
You're gonna be fine without me.

40:19.709 --> 40:23.794
Oh, for crying out loud,
lose the long faces. Smile, please.

40:24.010 --> 40:25.393
That's an order.

40:28.455 --> 40:29.977
Hey, you kids take care, all right?

40:29.978 --> 40:31.535
You guys behave now. 
You have a good time.

40:31.591 --> 40:33.049
Congratulations, you guys.
Good night. Thank you.

40:33.050 --> 40:34.597
Bye. Happy anniversary.

40:34.598 --> 40:35.002
Good night.

40:35.003 --> 40:38.059
Good night, captain.
What the hell did you say to him?

40:38.153 --> 40:39.702
Nothing. 
No, I just told him

40:39.703 --> 40:42.478
to listen to what his wife wanted.
Damn, Castle.

40:42.479 --> 40:44.396
How can you th-- 
I di--

40:44.627 --> 40:45.627
There's no way--

40:45.628 --> 40:48.905
Castle, let me let you
in on a little secret.

40:48.906 --> 40:51.368
Captain Montgomery retires all the time.

40:51.369 --> 40:53.080
Just give it a week or two.

40:53.081 --> 40:55.766
He's like the Brett Favre of the NYPD.

40:55.767 --> 40:57.582
Trust me. He's not going anywhere.

40:58.636 --> 41:00.341
Not going anywhere.

41:02.613 --> 41:04.229
Hey, so I've been meaning to ask you,

41:04.230 --> 41:06.442
did Alexis make a decision about Ashley?

41:06.443 --> 41:07.562
Oh, she did, actually.

41:07.563 --> 41:10.084
She decided it was, uh, worth the risk.

41:10.085 --> 41:12.878
And she's going to just keep showing up.

41:13.504 --> 41:14.923
That's a good choice.

41:15.664 --> 41:16.981
See you tomorrow.

41:18.387 --> 41:19.787
See you tomorrow.

41:25.208 --> 41:27.172
Ashley, what are you doing here?

41:27.173 --> 41:29.328
Hey, Mr. Castle. 
Hey, dad. Guess what.

41:29.329 --> 41:30.087
What?

41:30.281 --> 41:31.944
I'm going to Stanford.

41:32.767 --> 41:35.204
What? 
I'm applying for early admission.

41:35.287 --> 41:36.724
And since I've been taking extra classes

41:36.817 --> 41:38.271
each semester since my freshman year,

41:38.374 --> 41:40.341
I have enough credits to
graduate in the fall.

41:43.551 --> 41:44.503
What?

41:44.504 --> 41:47.307
Yeah, this way, Ash and I
will be together in January,

41:47.308 --> 41:48.525
in college.

41:48.935 --> 41:49.969
What?

41:50.339 --> 41:52.827
That was actually her idea, sir.

41:57.914 --> 41:59.098
What?

42:00.305 --> 42:06.912
