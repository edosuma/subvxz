00:12.054 --> 00:15.057
What a day this has been

00:15.057 --> 00:17.559
What a rare mood I'm in

00:17.559 --> 00:24.066
Why, it's almost like
being in love?

00:24.066 --> 00:30.072
There's a smile on my facfor
the whole human race...?

00:30.113 --> 00:31.114
Good evening, Mr. Braun.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.073
Go right in, please.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.577
How are you?

00:35.577 --> 00:37.079
Good seeing you.
How you been?

00:37.079 --> 00:39.081
Drop by the Tangiers;
dinner's on me.

00:42.084 --> 00:45.587
Almost like being in love...

00:45.629 --> 00:47.589
Hi Hi. How you are you?

00:52.094 --> 00:55.097
All the music of life
seems to be...?

00:57.099 --> 01:00.602
Just like a bell
that is ringing for me...?

01:00.644 --> 01:02.104
Oh, yeah.

01:02.104 --> 01:06.608
And from the way
that I feel?

01:07.109 --> 01:09.361
When that bell
starts to peal?

01:09.403 --> 01:11.613
I would swear
I was falling?

01:12.114 --> 01:14.616
I could swear I was falling?

01:15.117 --> 01:16.118
It's almost?

01:16.159 --> 01:18.120
Shh, shh...

01:18.120 --> 01:24.626
Like being in love.?

01:29.131 --> 01:30.632
Whoo!

01:34.636 --> 01:36.138
I haven't been
this out of breath

01:36.638 --> 01:40.142
since I bet Frank Sinatra
I wasn't ticklish.

01:42.644 --> 01:45.147
In a few minutes, there'll be
cake and champagne,

01:45.189 --> 01:50.152
so stick around;
the party's not over yet

01:52.154 --> 01:53.655
You've got eight minutes
to change.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.657
I'll come help
you. No, no, no. I'm fine.

01:55.699 --> 01:56.658
Go get the cake ready.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.161
And, Eve..

01:59.661 --> 02:01.163
light the candles.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.666
Oh... hi.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.169
Oh, hey, happy birthday.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.172
Um, I got to go soon

02:10.172 --> 02:11.673
'cause I got to go do my show.

02:11.715 --> 02:13.175
So...

02:13.175 --> 02:14.676
For years,
I did two shows a night,

02:15.177 --> 02:16.678
partied with the boys for hours,

02:16.678 --> 02:19.181
got a little sleep, played
some tennis, gave interviews,

02:19.681 --> 02:20.682
got onstage

02:20.682 --> 02:22.184
and did it all over again.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.186
That's talent.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.690
You've got a look.

02:30.192 --> 02:31.693
Pace yourself, honey.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.200
Lois O'Neill's bedroom

02:38.242 --> 02:40.702
the stuff dreams
are made of.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.205
Or nightmares.

02:43.205 --> 02:46.208
Did, uh, Miss O'Neill
tell you about this guy?

02:46.250 --> 02:47.209
We don't know where sheis.

02:47.209 --> 02:48.710
She disappeared about an hour ago.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.212
Her assistant went looking
for her, found the victim.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.505
ID'd him as Tim Duke.

02:51.547 --> 02:52.714
Gun left on the body..

02:52.714 --> 02:54.716
isn't that how the mob
used to do it?

02:54.758 --> 02:56.718
Well, back in the day,

02:56.718 --> 02:58.220
Lois O'Neill was famous
for singing and dancing.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.721
She was also famous

02:59.721 --> 03:01.223
for being the girlfriend
of Tony Constantine...

03:01.723 --> 03:03.725
One of the founding fathers
of Vegas.

03:03.767 --> 03:05.727
Looks like a bank vault.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.231
Well, the foundi ng father has placed

03:09.273 --> 03:11.233
a high priority
on home security.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.235
Have we been in there yetNo,
it hasn't been cleared yet.

03:13.277 --> 03:15.237
I'll go get the combination.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.244
Ricochet marks

03:31.753 --> 03:34.256
Possible bullet fragments.

03:38.760 --> 03:42.764
Bullet's here, body there...

03:43.265 --> 03:44.766
Moving target, maybe.

03:45.267 --> 03:47.019
Gentlemen, this
is Eve Girard,

03:47.060 --> 03:48.770
Miss O'Neills assistant.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.272
Would you open the vault, please?

03:50.314 --> 03:51.773
Okay.

03:51.773 --> 03:52.774
I'll be downstairs.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.293
Thank you.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.808
Just get it over with.

04:26.850 --> 04:27.809
Lois!

04:29.311 --> 04:30.812
Lois!
Oh, my God

04:32.814 --> 04:35.317
Oh...

04:35.817 --> 04:38.820
I thought this was
my last birthday.

04:47.329 --> 04:50.332
Who... are you??

04:50.332 --> 04:53.836
Who, who, who, who??

04:54.336 --> 04:56.839
Who... are you?

04:56.839 --> 04:58.590
Who, who, who, who??

04:58.632 --> 05:00.759
I really wanna know?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.845
Who... are you??

05:02.845 --> 05:05.347
Oh-oh-oh?
?Who...?

05:05.347 --> 05:07.850
Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

05:08.350 --> 05:11.353
Oh, you!?

05:15.357 --> 05:18.861
In the middle of the party,
you went upstairs to change.

05:18.902 --> 05:19.862
Isn't that unusual?

05:20.362 --> 05:21.363
No, I...

05:21.864 --> 05:24.366
I always wear one outfit
to greet guests,

05:24.408 --> 05:26.368
another for dinner and dancing,

05:26.410 --> 05:28.370
and another
for dessert.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.371
Thanks.

05:30.873 --> 05:31.874
So, uh, Tim Duke,

05:31.874 --> 05:36.879
the waiter... did you
know him before this?

05:36.879 --> 05:41.383
He worked the Children's
Hospital dance a few weeks ago.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.384
He was charming.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.891
I thought he could use the job.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.392
Right.

05:50.893 --> 05:51.894
I was changing

05:51.894 --> 05:54.396
I'd ordered a drink brought up

05:58.400 --> 06:00.402
He was crawling,
trying to get away.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.908
And then I heard another shot.

06:09.411 --> 06:12.915
That's, uh...

06:12.915 --> 06:14.416
That's when I knew
it was a mob hit.

06:14.917 --> 06:17.920
Look, if you
find his family,

06:18.420 --> 06:20.422
I'd like to do
something for them.

06:20.422 --> 06:24.426
I mean, after all, if he hadn'
come in just then, I'd be dead

06:24.468 --> 06:25.928
Who'd want to kill you?

06:28.931 --> 06:31.934
Do you have a first name, Sanders?

06:31.975 --> 06:32.935
Greg.

06:33.435 --> 06:34.937
Greg...

06:38.440 --> 06:41.443
Do you.. .Thank yo u.

06:46.949 --> 06:48.450
Hot off the press.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.453
I didn't hold back.

06:51.495 --> 06:52.955
I named names.

06:52.955 --> 06:55.958
After all this time, I thought,
who'd care?

06:55.999 --> 06:57.459
Well, maybe you thought wrong.

07:00.963 --> 07:02.965
Based on liver temp,
been dead one to two hours.

07:03.465 --> 07:06.468
It looks like two shots-
one to the chest

07:06.510 --> 07:09.471
and a through-and-through
to the head.

07:10.973 --> 07:12.474
Not a lot of blood.

07:12.474 --> 07:15.477
Shot to the heart: sometimes it
collects in the chest cavity

07:15.519 --> 07:16.478
rather than bleeding out.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.483
A thousand...

07:21.483 --> 07:23.485
When I was a waiter
back in college,

07:23.485 --> 07:25.988
if I had three 20s in my pocket,
it was a good night.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.991
At Chuck E. Cheese,
that was a good week.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.993
Crack vial?

07:30.993 --> 07:33.495
Could explain the cash;
maybe he was dealing.

07:33.996 --> 07:34.496
And these...

07:41.003 --> 07:43.005
Found a crack vial
on him,

07:43.046 --> 07:45.007
and $1,000 in cash.

07:48.510 --> 07:51.513
Presidents, movie stars...

07:51.513 --> 07:53.515
A drug-dealing waiter
isn't the kind of guy

07:53.557 --> 07:55.517
usually associated
with Lois O'Neill.

07:55.559 --> 07:56.518
On the other hand...

07:58.520 --> 07:59.521
Tony Constantine.

08:08.030 --> 08:11.033
What?

08:11.033 --> 08:13.035
The Copa Girls from the Sands.

08:13.076 --> 08:15.037
That's Lois O'Neill.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.039
That's my mother.

08:22.044 --> 08:25.047
"Happy Birthday
to my Beautiful Doll!

08:25.088 --> 08:26.048
"Love always, Tony"?

08:26.548 --> 08:28.050
I thought he was dead.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.552
Dead, like Jimmy Hoffa.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.554
The only guys who know
aren't telling.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.058
This party is organized

08:36.558 --> 08:37.058
like an invasion plan.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.559
"6:15: bar set up and ready.

08:39.061 --> 08:43.565
"6:25: Lois gree ts guests in foyer.

08:43.565 --> 08:47.069
"7:15: Lois changes
into her dinner outfit."

08:47.569 --> 08:49.071
Talk about attention
to detail.

08:49.071 --> 08:52.574
From the security cameras on
the perimeter of the building.

08:52.616 --> 08:53.867
What about
the interior cameras?

08:53.909 --> 08:55.077
With all
the extra measures,

08:55.077 --> 08:56.578
Lois felt
they weren't necessary.

08:56.620 --> 08:58.080
Frankly, I think
she just didn't want

08:58.080 --> 09:00.082
to be caught on tape
first thing in the morning.

09:00.582 --> 09:03.585
Hmm, I'll need a I ist of
all the guests who were here tonight.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.087
Guests and staff,
their affiliations

09:05.128 --> 09:06.088
and recent accomplishments...

09:06.088 --> 09:09.091
Lois likes to personalize
conversation.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.093
Everyone's still here.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.886
You're thorough.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.596
Well, that's my job.

09:39.121 --> 09:41.623
Grissom, do you have
any idea who's in this crowd?

09:42.124 --> 09:43.125
I sure do.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.626
"Under-sheriff
Jeff McKeen.

09:45.127 --> 09:49.131
"Arrival: 6:38 p. m.
Wife: Amanda.

09:49.173 --> 09:50.132
"Recent accomplishment:

09:50.132 --> 09:51.633
"ran marathon
for Children's Hospital,

09:51.675 --> 09:55.137
placed tenth
in his age group. "

09:55.179 --> 09:56.138
Good job, Jeff.

09:56.138 --> 09:58.640
More than one
of these VIPs

09:59.141 --> 10:00.142
has the governor's
home number,

10:00.142 --> 10:01.643
ing which is why my phone's been ring

10:01.685 --> 10:03.145
with orders
to let them go

10:03.145 --> 10:05.647
Well, no one on this list
came late or left early,

10:06.148 --> 10:09.151
so everyone here is still
a suspect, until they're not.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.652
And based on our interviews so far,

10:10.652 --> 10:12.654
only a few people actually
left the room

10:12.696 --> 10:14.156
when Lois O'Neill was gone

10:14.198 --> 10:15.157
Who?

10:15.657 --> 10:18.660
Among others, her... a
pop star known as Li'I Cherry.

10:19.161 --> 10:22.664
She was due onstage at
Mandalay Bay half an hour ago.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.667
Keep her and anyone else
who left the room.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.169
Let the rest go.

10:32.174 --> 10:34.676
Found this handkerchief
hanging off the balcony.

10:35.177 --> 10:36.678
I'll get it to Hodges.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.180
Good.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.182
By the way... Sam's here

10:43.185 --> 10:45.187
He's one of the guests
who was out of the room

10:45.229 --> 10:47.689
when the murder occurred.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.695
Well, I should say hi
to dear old Dad.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.700
Hi, Sam.
Muggs.

11:00.202 --> 11:03.205
Sam, when you left this room
tonight, where did you go?

11:03.247 --> 11:05.207
Upstairs?

11:05.207 --> 11:06.959
Just walked around downstairs,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.710
saying hello to the old ghosts.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.714
You know, I introduced
Lois and Tony,

11:12.756 --> 11:14.216
back when I was
a floor manager.

11:14.216 --> 11:15.717
She was in the line
with your mother.

11:16.218 --> 11:18.220
Mm.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.222
Maybe Mom fell for
the wrong gangster.

11:20.264 --> 11:24.226
Lily was a sweet girl.

11:24.226 --> 11:27.729
But Lois... she had to be a star.

11:27.729 --> 11:31.733
A real coal miner's daughter
from Frackville, Pennsylvania.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.236
But once she met Tony,
she never had to go back.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.241
You always were a sucker for
a hot dancer, weren't you, Sam

11:39.283 --> 11:41.743
Me and Lois- I love her,

11:41.743 --> 11:44.246
but I like to be
in the driver's seat.

11:44.288 --> 11:46.748
Like this dancer
I'm seeing now

11:46.748 --> 11:50.252
she's working tonight;
that's why I came stag.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.754
Must be serious.

11:52.754 --> 11:57.259
That's the first time you
haven't asked me how Mom's doing.

11:57.301 --> 11:59.261
She's fine, by the way.

12:01.263 --> 12:03.765
Mr. Jensen.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.517
I'm Nick Stokes.
I'm with the crime lab.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.269
I'm familiar
with your daughter's case.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.771
Sorry for your loss.

12:10.272 --> 12:12.274
You knew Mr. Constantine, right?

12:14.276 --> 12:16.028
Were there a ny other friends

12:16.069 --> 12:17.779
of Mr. Constantine
here tonight?

12:18.280 --> 12:19.781
Yeah, there were
friends here.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.283
And enemies.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.785
You want to elaborate a little
bit more on those enemies?

12:24.286 --> 12:26.788
Stokes, you trying to get me
in trouble?

12:26.788 --> 12:28.790
Hey, man, I'm just trying
to get to the bottom

12:28.832 --> 12:30.292
of what happened here
tonight.

12:30.292 --> 12:31.793
Several witnesses said they saw
you leave the room. Alone.

12:32.294 --> 12:33.795
I went outside to have a cigarette
- told her I wouldn't

12:33.837 --> 12:35.297
smoke in the house.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.299
Filthy habit.
Trying to quit.

12:37.341 --> 12:38.800
Mm.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.802
Frickin' cops won't
let me go.

12:40.844 --> 12:41.803
Yeah.

12:43.805 --> 12:46.308
Miss CherryI'll call you back.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.309
I'm with the crime lab.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.311
I need to ask you
a few questions.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.818
Hey, it's me. Are they
freaking out backstage?

12:56.860 --> 12:58.820
Excuse me...
What the...

12:58.862 --> 13:00.322
Please?

13:07.329 --> 13:08.831
Where did you go
when Miss O'Neill

13:09.331 --> 13:10.833
left the ballroom
earlier this evening?

13:10.874 --> 13:12.334
Uh, the bathroom.

13:12.334 --> 13:14.837
Do you recall what time
you came back?

13:14.837 --> 13:17.339
What, do you punch a clock
every time you take a leak?

13:20.843 --> 13:22.594
Did you know the victim-
Tim Duke?

13:22.636 --> 13:24.346
I don't kn ow anybody, okay?

13:24.346 --> 13:26.348
My publicist made me
come to this thing.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.350
I guess Lo-Lo needed
somebody with a pulse, so...

13:28.350 --> 13:30.352
May I take a look at your
handbagI got a show to do

13:30.853 --> 13:32.855
I've got 2,000 people waiting
for me right now.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.857
We can get a warrant,
but you'll get out of here

13:35.357 --> 13:36.358
a lot faster if you just
let me see the bag.

13:38.360 --> 13:39.361
Hey!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

13:39.361 --> 13:41.864
Let me go! Get your
han ds off of me, man

13:41.864 --> 13:44.366
You're under arrest
for assaulting an officer.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.368
I was doin g my job . Well...

13:46.410 --> 13:47.870
now I don't need
a warrant.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.887
I don't know how that cr
ack pipe got in my purse, so..

14:04.928 --> 14:06.847
There. My client denies
the pipe is hers,

14:06.889 --> 14:09.391
denies any drug use,
doesn't know the vic tim

14:09.433 --> 14:11.894
and has no prior relationship
to Miss O'Neill.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.896
There's nothing to discuss.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.856
The pipe was in your possession.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.901
Plus, you were displaying
symptoms of crack use publicly.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.904
And you were at a recent party
where the victim, who

14:21.945 --> 14:23.405
also used crack,

14:23.906 --> 14:25.866
was working.

14:25.908 --> 14:27.409
You admitted to leaving the
ballroom after Miss O'Neill.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.369
Coincidences don't make
a homicide.

14:29.411 --> 14:32.414
You recognized Tim Duke
and you needed a fix.

14:32.456 --> 14:33.874
Look, I'm not holding.

14:33.916 --> 14:34.917
I told you befor Come on. Yeah, you do.

14:34.958 --> 14:36.877
Come on, man.
Look...

14:36.919 --> 14:38.420
Here, man. SeeWhat are you
gonna do for me, little girl?

14:38.462 --> 14:39.379
Yeah, see?

14:39.421 --> 14:40.923
Hey, quit pushingme!

14:40.964 --> 14:41.924
No... no, no!

14:43.425 --> 14:45.177
You wiped down the gun
with a handkerchief...

14:45.219 --> 14:46.887
No one has established
that my client had a gun.

14:46.929 --> 14:48.931
And you didn't want to be seen
leaving the bedroom,

14:48.972 --> 14:50.933
so you climbed down the balcony
to rejoin the party.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.935
Which is how
you scraped your knees.

14:58.941 --> 15:00.901
Okay, I'll admit I was outside

15:00.943 --> 15:02.444
But. It's in your
best interests not to...

15:02.486 --> 15:05.405
It's cool. Um...

15:05.447 --> 15:07.950
It wasn't just, uh,
Lois's birthday tonight,

15:08.450 --> 15:10.410
it was also my bodyguard's
birthday,

15:10.452 --> 15:14.957
and I scraped my knees,
giving him his present.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.461
You're going to need to cancel
your shows for a while.

15:19.503 --> 15:21.964
We're holding you on possession
of paraphernalia,

15:22.005 --> 15:23.924
and unlawful use.

15:23.966 --> 15:27.469
What do I have to do
to make you believe me?

15:27.511 --> 15:30.430
I already had my birthday.

15:30.472 --> 15:33.475
All right, areas
of callus here.

15:33.517 --> 15:36.937
Old fractures...
ribs...

15:36.979 --> 15:39.481
This guy must've worked
some pretty rough shifts.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.483
That must be the
bullet, right there.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.945
Yeah, I'll yank it
in autopsy.

15:44.987 --> 15:46.488
What's that happening all around
the nose area?

15:46.530 --> 15:47.948
It's a nose cage.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.993
Nose has been wired to the
skull to hold it in place.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.502
We find them sometimes
in boxers, accident victims...

16:00.544 --> 16:02.963
You ever see one on a waiter?

16:03.005 --> 16:05.507
Wow! You know, Lois had
her first sexual experience

16:05.549 --> 16:08.010
on her ninth-grade field trip
to the state capitol...

16:08.510 --> 16:09.970
with the governor.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.471
I found the bullet hole.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.973
Could you bring
the Sawzall?

16:13.015 --> 16:14.516
Well, you know, this place is
a piece of Las Vegas history;

16:15.017 --> 16:16.476
you don't want to just go
and chop it up.

16:16.518 --> 16:20.522
It's a crime scene, and there's
evidence under the floor.

16:20.564 --> 16:23.525
Yeah, but we don't know exactly
where it is, so...

16:27.529 --> 16:30.032
...I thought
we'd let "Hawkeye" here

16:30.073 --> 16:31.491
do a little exploration for us.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.785
Sure. I wouldn't want to damage

16:33.827 --> 16:36.038
priceless, 40-year-old
carpeting.

16:36.538 --> 16:37.039
No.

16:58.560 --> 17:00.062
What's that say?

17:00.103 --> 17:01.563
Pull it up

17:06.068 --> 17:08.529
Ten-grand brick.

17:08.569 --> 17:11.073
Benjamin bit the bullet.

17:11.114 --> 17:13.534
"In God We Trust

17:13.575 --> 17:17.079
If she has a vault, why is she
keeping cash under the floor?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.080
No more room under the mattress?

17:29.591 --> 17:31.093
Easy access in case
you need to rewire.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.603
Or steal a million.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.570
Hey.
Hey.

17:49.611 --> 17:52.072
Mandy got an AFIS
hit off the vic.

17:52.114 --> 17:56.118
His a. k.a. is Tim Duke, but his
real name is Vincent Pullone,

17:56.160 --> 17:58.579
a one-time Golden Gloves
wannabe.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.122
That would explain
the prior injuries.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.082
Yeah, well, so
does his rap sheet

18:02.124 --> 18:04.626
The guy was busy: multip
le assaults, theft...

18:04.668 --> 18:07.129
Is that the surveillance footage?

18:07.629 --> 18:08.589
Yeah.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.632
I've been through the footage
throughout the entire day.

18:10.674 --> 18:12.634
I've got the party staffers
coming in

18:12.676 --> 18:13.594
and out the back door.

18:13.635 --> 18:18.140
But, get this-
same time, different entrance.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.103
Well, that's our vic.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.147
Yeah, a couple minutes
later.

18:25.189 --> 18:28.108
Now, here...

18:28.150 --> 18:31.653
around the time
of the murder,

18:31.695 --> 18:35.115
same car... pulls up...
waits.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.659
Freeze that.
Can you get a plate number?

18:37.701 --> 18:38.660
Yeah.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.124
Nice.

18:44.166 --> 18:45.167
Nevada 295,

18:45.667 --> 18:48.170
Ocean, Henry, Union.

18:52.174 --> 18:54.176
"Nanci... Mc... Ma... "

18:54.218 --> 18:56.178
McGinnigle...
McGonigle.

18:56.220 --> 18:58.138
McGonigle?
McGonigle.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.640
I'll run it through Brass.

18:59.681 --> 19:02.684
Handkerchief is line n. Edging
appears to be hand-stitched.

19:02.726 --> 19:05.187
Pretty nice rag to
be wiping a gun off with.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.147
Oh, so it was positive
for gun oil.

19:07.189 --> 19:10.192
Yeah. And the diphenylamine
te st was also positive

19:10.234 --> 19:12.694
for oxidizers and partially
burned gunpowder.

19:12.736 --> 19:14.655
Uh, negative for
prints or DNA.

19:14.696 --> 19:19.701
So, Mandy wasn't able to lift
any prints off of the cash we found.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.703
Fingerprints are just oil, water
and amino acids, Greg.

19:21.745 --> 19:22.704
They don't last forever.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.164
No kidding.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.707
You ever hear that expression
"old money"?

19:25.749 --> 19:27.167
This stuff was ancient-

19:27.209 --> 19:29.711
some of it's signed by
Eisenhower's Treasury Secretary.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.172
Series dates
all before 1965.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.216
Same with the grand
we found on the vic.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.717
Ancient?

19:36.718 --> 19:39.221
Set them down there.

19:44.726 --> 19:45.727
Miss O'Neill!
Hello.

19:45.769 --> 19:46.728
Nice to see you.

19:47.229 --> 19:48.689
What's all this?

19:48.730 --> 19:50.691
An army travels on its stomach.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.735
I wanted you and your people
to know how grateful I am

19:53.777 --> 19:56.196
for all you've done for me
Well, thank you.

19:56.238 --> 19:59.241
nce But, uh, we can't accept
anything that might influe

19:59.283 --> 20:01.243
the outcome of the case-
it's our policy.

20:01.285 --> 20:02.703
Oh, come on.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.997
Cold cuts...
a little shrimp salad.

20:05.038 --> 20:07.249
Shrimp salad...

20:07.749 --> 20:08.750
I know what we can do.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.502
Have your boys
take it down the street

20:10.544 --> 20:11.753
to the St. Vincent
homeless shelter.

20:11.795 --> 20:13.255
They need it more than we do.

20:13.297 --> 20:15.757
Well...

20:17.259 --> 20:18.260
Ooh...

20:22.264 --> 20:24.516
Having fun
with my book, Greg?

20:24.558 --> 20:26.727
Oh, yeah.
That beach party..

20:26.768 --> 20:28.770
Hoo-hoo. Marilyn Monroe
and the President.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.772
Swing-a-ding-ding.

20:33.275 --> 20:35.777
By the way, Miss O'Neill,
we made an interesting discovery

20:35.819 --> 20:37.738
under the floor
of your bedroom.

20:37.779 --> 20:40.282
I was hoping you
could tell us about it

20:40.324 --> 20:44.786
Under the floor...?

20:44.828 --> 20:46.288
You tell me.

20:46.788 --> 20:48.790
Approximately one million
dollars in cash.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.760
What do you know.

20:59.801 --> 21:02.763
Tony always said
I'd be taken care of.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.307
If you don't know
anything about the money,

21:05.349 --> 21:06.808
maybe you know someone who does.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.060
Benny Dunbar,

21:08.101 --> 21:09.311
Jimmy the Crumb...

21:11.313 --> 21:14.316
You'd have to ask Tony.

21:16.318 --> 21:17.277
Where is the money now?

21:17.319 --> 21:19.321
It's in our evidence vault

21:19.363 --> 21:21.782
Oh. And, uh...

21:21.823 --> 21:23.826
when will it be returned?

21:24.326 --> 21:26.328
We have to finish our
investigation first.

21:26.370 --> 21:28.330
You do that.

21:30.833 --> 21:34.336
You know...

21:34.837 --> 21:37.840
the boys who want me dead
have been doing this

21:37.881 --> 21:41.093
a lot longer than you have.

21:41.134 --> 21:44.346
I need you to catch up.
Fast.

21:47.349 --> 21:50.352
Oh, and remember, when your
tummy starts to rumble,

21:50.394 --> 21:53.856
I tried to help.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.866
There. There, that piece
of paper, zoom in on that.

22:08.370 --> 22:09.872
See if I can enhance that.

22:10.873 --> 22:13.375
What is that, a bar code?

22:13.876 --> 22:17.880
Looks like a PDF417...
two-dimensional bar code.

22:17.921 --> 22:18.881
Can you decode it?

22:19.381 --> 22:20.883
I think so.

22:22.885 --> 22:26.388
Okay, it's an airline
boarding pass,

22:26.430 --> 22:29.892
last night:
Vegas to Philadelphia,

22:29.933 --> 22:32.352
then on to Rome and Sardinia.

22:32.394 --> 22:37.399
Two passengers: Nanci McGonigle
and Vincent Pullone.

22:37.441 --> 22:39.902
Vincent Pullone was
the vic's real name,

22:39.943 --> 22:41.904
and he arrived at the crime scene

22:42.404 --> 22:44.364
in Nanci McGonigle's car.

22:44.406 --> 22:47.910
According to the airline global
distribution system,

22:47.951 --> 22:51.914
she boarded the flight,
he didn't.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.917
He was busy being dead

22:55.417 --> 22:58.420
Your fingerprint was on the
light fixture in the hallway.

22:58.462 --> 22:59.922
You knew
about the money.

23:00.422 --> 23:02.674
When the light fixture
shorted out,

23:02.716 --> 23:05.052
Lois wanted it replaced
right away.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.429
I did it myself,
and I found the money.

23:07.471 --> 23:08.931
How much did you take?

23:11.934 --> 23:14.436
One bundle- 10,000.
I- I still have most of it.

23:14.937 --> 23:16.939
Did you te ll Miss O'Neill?

23:16.980 --> 23:19.900
No. And that was wrong.

23:19.942 --> 23:22.444
But it was also wrong of her
to hire me as a book editor

23:22.945 --> 23:24.404
and use me as a personal slave.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.948
How well did you k
now Vincent Pullone?

23:25.989 --> 23:27.449
A.k.a. "Tim Duke. "

23:30.452 --> 23:31.912
Not very well.

23:31.954 --> 23:35.958
But well enough to give him
a thousand dollars?

23:35.999 --> 23:38.418
We were dating.
He needed the money.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.963
If you were dating, why was
he planning to fly to Sardinia

23:41.004 --> 23:45.467
after the party with Nanci McGonigle?

23:45.509 --> 23:46.927
He didn't mention her.

23:46.969 --> 23:48.971
Someone in the house
gave him the tickets.

23:49.471 --> 23:50.472
Well, not me.

23:55.978 --> 23:59.940
Sounds like the bullet to me.

23:59.982 --> 24:03.986
Yeah. Deformed, medium caliber,
consistent with a.38.

24:04.027 --> 24:06.488
Take a look at the heart.

24:07.990 --> 24:11.493
Bullet passed into the base
of the right ventricle,

24:11.535 --> 24:13.996
crossed
the intraventricular septum

24:14.037 --> 24:15.747
and destroyed the AV node.

24:15.789 --> 24:17.499
Heart stopped on impact.

24:18.000 --> 24:21.753
Right. Bullet then exited out
the back of the left ventricle

24:21.795 --> 24:25.507
and entered the vertebral spine,
transecting the spinal cord.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.513
Could the victim h
ave crawled around

24:31.555 --> 24:32.973
after suffering
that kind of damage?

24:33.015 --> 24:35.517
Negative. He would have been
paralyzed instantly.

24:35.559 --> 24:38.020
Could the shot to the he
ad have occurred first?

24:38.061 --> 24:41.023
You are "O"- for-two.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.524
Check out the brain.

24:48.030 --> 24:50.032
There's no blood
in the wound track.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.492
Nope.

24:51.533 --> 24:53.535
So his heart had already
stopped pumping.

24:54.036 --> 24:55.037
From the absence of blood,

24:55.537 --> 24:57.539
I'd say that this shot w
as at least ten minutes

24:58.040 --> 25:00.792
after the shot
through the heart.

25:00.834 --> 25:03.504
Lois O'Neill claims
that she saw

25:03.545 --> 25:06.548
the victim crawling away
after she heard the first shot.

25:06.590 --> 25:10.052
Well, maybe Lois's memory
is a little flawed.

25:10.093 --> 25:13.555
Oh, no.
She has a great memory.

25:29.363 --> 25:31.865
Welcome to DiMerci's, gentlemen.

25:31.907 --> 25:33.367
Do you have reservations?

25:33.408 --> 25:34.868
No, we're all set.

25:34.910 --> 25:35.869
All right.

25:36.370 --> 25:37.371
Okay.
You sure?

25:41.375 --> 25:43.126
The gang's all here!

25:43.168 --> 25:44.753
We need to ask you

25:44.795 --> 25:46.338
some questions

25:46.380 --> 25:49.383
Well, please, sit. I-I have
no secrets from Bobby,

25:49.424 --> 25:50.843
my... guardian angel.

25:50.884 --> 25:53.387
BobYeah, we'vemet.
Isn't that right,

25:53.887 --> 25:54.388
Uh, yeah, that's right.

25:55.889 --> 25:58.350
Please, sit.

25:58.392 --> 26:00.894
How often do you get invited
to the best table in town?

26:00.936 --> 26:03.397
I know you must be hungry.

26:03.897 --> 26:06.859
Miss O'Neill,

26:06.900 --> 26:09.903
we found some inconsistencies
in your account

26:10.404 --> 26:12.406
of last night's events.

26:12.447 --> 26:13.866
Wha...?

26:13.907 --> 26:15.409
You said that you saw
Tim Duke crawling away

26:15.909 --> 26:16.910
after you heard
the first shot.

26:19.413 --> 26:21.915
Yes.

26:22.416 --> 26:24.376
It was horrible.

26:24.418 --> 26:27.921
According to our autopsy,
the first shot paralyzed him.

26:27.963 --> 26:29.923
He would've been unable
to move.

26:34.428 --> 26:35.888
O'NEILL
Well...

26:35.929 --> 26:39.433
It-it all happened
in such a flash...

26:43.937 --> 26:45.939
Hey!

26:45.981 --> 26:47.900
Uh...

26:47.941 --> 26:49.443
All right.

26:49.943 --> 26:50.944
She's the target.

26:51.445 --> 26:52.446
She told you all she knows.

26:59.453 --> 27:02.956
This has been fun,
but... we have to go.

27:02.998 --> 27:04.958
Beauty sleep, you know.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.919
Speaking of which...

27:06.960 --> 27:11.465
When is that ugly yellow tape
coming off my bedroom door?

27:11.507 --> 27:13.967
Just as soon as we finish
our work, I promise.

27:15.969 --> 27:18.972
Any more questions
... just call.

27:26.980 --> 27:27.981
Tuna...

27:28.482 --> 27:30.484
and the homeless are dining
on shrimp salad.

27:30.984 --> 27:32.486
Lucky clydes.

27:32.528 --> 27:33.946
"Lucky clydes?"

27:33.987 --> 27:36.949
Is that lingo from Lois's book

27:36.990 --> 27:38.951
She say anything
in that book

27:38.992 --> 27:39.993
about all that dough we found
under her floor?

27:40.494 --> 27:41.954
Not exactly.

27:41.995 --> 27:44.998
But she does say back in '65,

27:45.499 --> 27:48.001
Vegas was getting
a little bit too hot for Tony C,

27:48.043 --> 27:50.003
so he had to take a powder
for a while.

27:50.504 --> 27:51.964
And dig this: While he was gone,

27:52.005 --> 27:55.008
the famous Pan Am heist was
pulled off back east.

27:55.050 --> 27:56.969
The famous Pan Am heist?

27:57.010 --> 27:59.513
And, compadre, in the next
chapter,

28:00.013 --> 28:02.266
Tony builds Lois the house.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.518
Connect the dots, buddy boy.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.980
All right,
this is what we got so far:

28:08.021 --> 28:10.524
We got a loser boxer,
who's a crack head,

28:10.566 --> 28:11.984
probably selling drugs-

28:12.025 --> 28:14.027
and someone buys him
two tickets to Sardinia.

28:14.069 --> 28:15.487
Why?

28:15.529 --> 28:19.032
Maybe somebody wanted
Lois dead,

28:19.074 --> 28:20.534
knew that
Tim had access

28:21.034 --> 28:24.037
and that he needed the
money for a drug habit

28:24.079 --> 28:25.539
Are you saying
that he was a hit man

28:25.581 --> 28:26.540
and not an innocent bystander?

28:27.040 --> 28:29.543
Well, it would make Lois' story
correct-

28:29.585 --> 28:32.045
that she really was the target.

28:32.087 --> 28:34.798
Yeah, but who killed him?
And why?

28:34.840 --> 28:37.509
Consider this nutty notion:

28:37.551 --> 28:39.511
Tony's not worm food,
he's around;

28:39.553 --> 28:42.514
he finds out that Lois went
canary and wrote the book,

28:42.556 --> 28:46.059
so he hires some protection,
someone who'd be at the party.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.562
Whether Tim Duke was a hit man
or not,

28:49.062 --> 28:51.064
he could have been the target
all along.

28:51.106 --> 28:52.566
Yeah, yeah

28:53.066 --> 28:56.069
Then you go whack him when he's
working arou nd every VIP in town. Sure.

28:56.570 --> 28:59.072
Sure. Especially if Lois
was an accomplice.

28:59.573 --> 29:01.575
Or, dare I say, the killer.

29:02.075 --> 29:06.580
Well, I don't see homici
de anywhere on her schedule.

29:09.583 --> 29:14.046
Wait a sec...

29:14.087 --> 29:16.048
That's Lois' dinner outfit,

29:16.089 --> 29:18.592
and that's the dress
she was wearing

29:18.634 --> 29:20.093
when we opened up the vault.

29:21.595 --> 29:24.097
Let's test them both
for blood and GSR.

29:27.601 --> 29:30.103
Looking under "formal"...

29:31.104 --> 29:34.608
Dress number 161.

29:35.108 --> 29:37.569
130, 131, 132...

29:37.611 --> 29:39.613
Oh, got to admit,
this is some kind of closet.

29:42.616 --> 29:47.579
Uh, it's 1-... 61.

29:47.621 --> 29:50.123
Oh. 161-
hanger's empty.

29:50.165 --> 29:52.584
She got rid of the clothes?

29:52.626 --> 29:54.628
It's possible she
sent them to the cleaners

29:54.670 --> 29:56.129
to get rid of blood and GSR.

29:56.630 --> 29:57.631
We can get a warrant.

29:58.131 --> 30:02.135
Well... she wouldn't have se
nt her jewelry to the cleaners.

30:06.139 --> 30:08.642
Got it. Drawer 19.

30:12.646 --> 30:18.151
Oh. How apropos
that she's named names.

30:18.193 --> 30:19.653
A canary diamond.

30:20.153 --> 30:24.158
Want to bet the birdie sings
in the key of GSR?

30:56.190 --> 30:56.690
Mom?

30:58.192 --> 30:59.443
What are you doing?

30:59.484 --> 31:00.652
Where's Lindsey?

31:00.694 --> 31:02.696
She's on a sleep-over.

31:02.738 --> 31:05.657
So kill me

31:05.699 --> 31:09.203
And I had dinner
at Drai's with the girls.

31:09.703 --> 31:12.206
Filet to die for.

31:12.247 --> 31:14.208
Drai's...

31:14.708 --> 31:18.212
The girls like to spend.

31:21.715 --> 31:24.218
Red wine always makes me
two of the Seven Dwarfs:

31:24.718 --> 31:25.719
Sleepy and Sneezy.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.723
Where did you
get that hanky?

31:29.765 --> 31:31.225
A friend.

31:33.227 --> 31:35.729
A friend
who was at Lois's party?

31:36.730 --> 31:38.482
Now don't get mad, Catherine.

31:38.524 --> 31:40.234
You can't
be seeing Sam.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.194
And why not?

31:42.236 --> 31:43.237
Oh, for one thing,
he's a player.

31:43.737 --> 31:46.240
I don't expect monogamy
from him.

31:46.281 --> 31:47.699
I can't believe this.

31:47.741 --> 31:50.244
And I am not promising that
he'll get it from me, either.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.204
What are you doing?

31:52.246 --> 31:54.706
Put it in the envelope
Why?!

31:54.748 --> 31:56.750
Because we haven't cleared
Sam as a suspect.

31:56.792 --> 31:58.210
He can't be!

31:58.252 --> 32:01.755
He has been so wonderful to me
these past few weeks.

32:02.256 --> 32:05.008
Oh, this has been going on
for weeks, huh?

32:05.050 --> 32:07.761
We have a history together,
Catherine.

32:07.803 --> 32:11.723
We were young together.

32:11.765 --> 32:14.268
Someday, maybe
you'll understand.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.544
You want to see me,
Muggs,

32:40.586 --> 32:42.754
all you need
is a phone.

32:42.796 --> 32:46.800
You lied about being
in Lois O'Neill's bedroom.

32:46.842 --> 32:49.803
I was in that bedroom once.

32:49.845 --> 32:52.264
In 1967.

32:52.306 --> 32:54.266
As a gentleman,

32:54.308 --> 32:56.768
I would prefer not going
into details.

32:56.810 --> 33:01.815
Your handkerchief puts you there
when the waiter was shot.

33:04.318 --> 33:06.320
One of these?

33:09.323 --> 33:13.327
Lois and I were going over
old times.

33:13.368 --> 33:16.330
She got a little weepy.

33:19.333 --> 33:22.836
What she did with it
after that, I don't know

33:22.878 --> 33:26.340
My housekeeper made me
a dozen for Christmas.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.092
I've only got half left.

33:29.134 --> 33:31.345
So quit giving them away.

33:34.348 --> 33:38.352
Oh... you're mothering me.

33:41.355 --> 33:43.315
You know, Sam,

33:43.357 --> 33:46.360
this is the second time
that I thought

33:46.401 --> 33:48.362
that you might be
a killer.

33:48.403 --> 33:49.822
Come on,

33:49.863 --> 33:51.824
you know better.

33:51.865 --> 33:54.368
The thing is, I don't.

33:56.370 --> 33:57.871
It never occurred to me
for a minute

33:58.372 --> 34:01.375
that this is something
that you wouldn't have done.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.627
And that wouldn't bother me,

34:03.669 --> 34:05.879
except you're dating my mother

34:05.921 --> 34:06.839
Look,

34:06.880 --> 34:11.385
I'm being good
to Lil this time around.

34:11.426 --> 34:14.388
Give us a chance.

34:16.389 --> 34:18.891
Give me a chance.

34:19.393 --> 34:21.353
You'll see.

34:21.395 --> 34:22.396
Making up for stabbing
one showgirl

34:22.896 --> 34:26.400
by being kind to another. Hmm.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.902
If you weren't my daughter..

34:29.945 --> 34:31.362
What?

34:31.405 --> 34:34.408
What would you do, Sam?

34:54.928 --> 34:57.890
Vanity, thy name is Hodges.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.434
This isn't
what it looks like.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.936
I actually like
my gray hair.

35:02.978 --> 35:04.897
The few that I have.

35:04.938 --> 35:06.940
Hodges, don't you
know that gray hair

35:07.441 --> 35:09.443
can be very attractive

35:09.484 --> 35:12.946
The ring?

35:13.947 --> 35:15.407
The ring.

35:15.449 --> 35:19.912
The ring was positive
for GSR.

35:19.953 --> 35:22.456
That means Lois could be the shooter.

35:25.959 --> 35:27.961
I guess we'll have
to bring her in.

35:33.467 --> 35:35.469
One of your guys take
the crime scene tape down?

35:35.969 --> 35:38.472
Sara and Catherine cleared
the scene about two hours ago.

35:45.979 --> 35:48.482
Miss O'Neill,
Las Vegas Police.

35:59.993 --> 36:01.495
Miss O'Neill?

36:04.998 --> 36:10.504
I thought you cared about me?

36:12.005 --> 36:18.011
Where are you??

36:18.512 --> 36:23.517
Where's my heart??

36:26.520 --> 36:32.526
Where is the dream
we started??

36:33.026 --> 36:39.533
I can't believe
we're parted...?

36:40.033 --> 36:45.038
Where are you??

36:48.542 --> 36:51.044
Wow, it's the end of an era.

36:51.086 --> 36:53.505
From the containment
of the blood,

36:53.547 --> 36:56.550
it appears she was shot
while lying down.

36:56.592 --> 36:58.510
Asleep

36:58.552 --> 37:01.013
or surprised by
someone she trusted?

37:01.054 --> 37:04.558
Nick just found out that
Tim Duke's airline tickets

37:04.600 --> 37:06.518
were purchased by a credit card

37:06.560 --> 37:08.312
under the name
of Double-X Associates.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.063
That's Lois O'Neill's company.

37:10.105 --> 37:11.523
How do you know that?

37:11.565 --> 37:13.525
She was the double-kiss girl.

37:13.567 --> 37:15.068
Yeah, you can't
say her name

37:15.110 --> 37:16.570
without kissing twice.

37:16.612 --> 37:18.822
Lois O'Neill-

37:18.864 --> 37:21.074
Kiss-kiss. XX.

37:21.116 --> 37:23.076
Huh.

37:23.577 --> 37:27.080
Well, Nick also found out
that the only two names

37:27.122 --> 37:30.584
authorized to sign on that card,
were Lois O'Neill

37:30.626 --> 37:32.586
and Eve Girard.

37:38.091 --> 37:39.092
She looks perfect, doesn't she

37:39.593 --> 37:41.595
Except for these smudges
on her eyelids.

38:18.632 --> 38:19.633
Grissom,

38:20.133 --> 38:21.134
you know I was
looking into

38:21.635 --> 38:23.136
that Pan Am heist in '65

38:23.178 --> 38:24.638
On your own time, I hope.

38:25.138 --> 38:26.098
It's related
to our case.

38:26.139 --> 38:28.642
I just got off the phone
with the FBI lab at Quantico.

38:28.684 --> 38:30.394
Bobby Dawson
sent them ballistics

38:30.435 --> 38:32.145
on the gun we found
on Tim Duke.

38:32.187 --> 38:33.146
And?

38:33.647 --> 38:35.399
It's a match to the gun
that was used

38:35.440 --> 38:37.109
to kill a guard
in the Pan Am heist.

38:37.151 --> 38:39.153
So I sent them serials
on the cash we found

38:39.653 --> 38:41.155
Also a match
to the Pan Am heist?

38:41.196 --> 38:43.115
Right-o, daddy-o.

38:43.157 --> 38:44.158
Congratulations, Greg.

38:47.161 --> 38:50.164
This is Doc Robbins' preliminary
autopsy report

38:50.664 --> 38:52.624
on Lois O'Neill.

38:52.666 --> 38:55.669
When he opened her up, he found
that her body was riddled

38:55.711 --> 38:58.172
with advanced tumors.

38:58.213 --> 39:00.174
Wow.

39:02.676 --> 39:04.678
She knew she was
going to die.

39:05.179 --> 39:07.139
That's why she wrote the book,

39:07.181 --> 39:09.183
'cause she knew that
if she was gone,

39:09.683 --> 39:11.185
there'd be nobody
left to tell the true story

39:11.685 --> 39:14.146
You read it.

39:14.188 --> 39:16.190
Do you think that's how
she wanted to go out?

39:16.690 --> 39:17.649
No.

39:17.691 --> 39:24.198
But, uh...
looking beautiful- yeah.

39:24.239 --> 39:27.201
In all the papers- yeah.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.202
Murdered...

39:28.702 --> 39:31.705
Only if she was the one
who called the shots

39:32.206 --> 39:33.707
Yeah.

39:35.709 --> 39:37.669
Oh, we had some good times.

39:37.711 --> 39:41.215
You knew she had cancer?
No, she had guts.

39:41.256 --> 39:44.218
She staged her exit
like a pro.

39:44.259 --> 39:47.179
The book, the party...

39:47.221 --> 39:50.224
She only made one mistake-
she hired an amateur.

39:50.265 --> 39:52.184
Tim Duke?

39:52.226 --> 39:53.727
Also known as Vincent Pullone?

39:53.769 --> 39:57.689
A wimp and a thief.

39:57.731 --> 39:59.983
Lois would give you
all the cookies you wanted,

40:00.025 --> 40:02.236
but you stuck your hand
in the cookie jar...

40:05.239 --> 40:05.739
she'd chop it off.

40:07.741 --> 40:10.494
Try to relax, honey.

40:10.536 --> 40:13.205
This'll be easy.

40:13.247 --> 40:15.749
I'll be on the bed,
one shot.

40:15.791 --> 40:18.752
Don't be sloppy.

40:28.262 --> 40:30.514
What the hel IWhat do you care?

40:30.556 --> 40:32.766
You're going
to be dead anyway.

40:32.808 --> 40:35.769
Nobody steals from me.

40:51.285 --> 40:53.745
Why'd she ask Duke, not you?

40:53.787 --> 40:56.790
She didn't want to involve
an old friend.

40:56.832 --> 40:58.250
Until yesterday.

40:58.292 --> 41:01.044
Yesterday afternoon,
Lois O'Neill wired

41:01.086 --> 41:03.797
$250,000 to your sister
in Sarasota.

41:03.839 --> 41:06.258
Now you were TonyC's driver

41:06.300 --> 41:09.303
The only one he trusted
to bodyguard Miss O'Neill.

41:09.344 --> 41:13.307
You took care of her
right until the end.

41:13.807 --> 41:16.310
Well, who else do I have
to take care of?

41:16.810 --> 41:18.812
My guess is she offered
you the money,

41:18.854 --> 41:20.772
but being a friend,
you refused.

41:20.814 --> 41:22.816
So, she sent it
to your sister instead.

41:29.823 --> 41:32.326
She sent it to my sister.

41:32.826 --> 41:34.286
You know,

41:34.328 --> 41:38.832
you've got a choice

41:39.333 --> 41:44.338
between checking out
all shriveled up, in a hospital,

41:44.379 --> 41:48.342
or at home, looking like
a million bucks.

41:48.842 --> 41:54.348
Any guy who'd do that
for a good friend...

41:54.848 --> 41:56.350
he's okay by me.

41:58.852 --> 42:04.358
If you see Tony...
tell him I love him.

42:04.858 --> 42:06.860
No, doll...

42:08.362 --> 42:10.364
You're going to see him
before I do.

42:31.385 --> 42:37.850
Where are you??

42:37.891 --> 42:45.399
Where have you gone
without me??

42:45.440 --> 42:52.906
I thought you cared about me

42:52.948 --> 42:58.871
Where are you??

42:58.912 --> 43:03.917
Where's my heart??

43:06.920 --> 43:12.885
Where's the dream
we started??

43:12.926 --> 43:19.933
ted?
I can't believe we're par

43:19.975 --> 43:26.440
Where are you??

43:26.940 --> 43:31.945
When we said good-bye, love?

43:32.446 --> 43:37.910
What had we to gain??

43:37.951 --> 43:46.460
When I gave you my love?

43:46.502 --> 43:54.218
Was it all in vain??

43:54.259 --> 44:01.934
All life through?

44:01.975 --> 44:09.942
Must I go on pretending?

44:09.983 --> 44:15.989
Where is that happy ending??

44:16.490 --> 44:24.998
Where are you??

44:25.040 --> 44:33.507
Where are you??

44:34.305 --> 44:40.201
