WEBVTT

03:12.213 --> 03:14.172
Thing of beauty.

03:19.178 --> 03:21.346
Good morning, sir.

03:21.431 --> 03:24.182
Yet another
on-time delivery from...

03:24.267 --> 03:27.352
Get the hell
out of my face, canner.

03:27.437 --> 03:29.563
Have a nice day.

03:31.733 --> 03:36.445
And we believe our "Destination
Anywhere" package to be the best value.

03:36.529 --> 03:40.949
Let us take you to your dream destination
aboard our orbital space-plane...

03:51.711 --> 03:55.422
Glowfish.
The world's hot-selling transgenic treat.

04:00.887 --> 04:02.804
Excuse me, sir.

04:02.889 --> 04:05.557
Total readiness. Total security.

04:05.641 --> 04:09.061
So good-bye to lengthy upgrades
and service calls.

04:09.145 --> 04:12.147
An uplink to U.S.R.'s central computer
provides this state-of-the-art robot...

04:12.231 --> 04:14.149
with new programs daily.

04:14.233 --> 04:17.277
The Nestor Class 5
is tomorrow's robot today.

04:17.362 --> 04:21.447
Spoon! Spoonie!

04:21.531 --> 04:23.784
Hey!

04:23.868 --> 04:27.329
Uh... Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

04:27.413 --> 04:29.581
- Hey, man!
- Spoon, man, where you been at?

04:29.665 --> 04:31.583
- Just away, Farber.
- Oh, yeah, away?

04:31.667 --> 04:33.710
Like vacation and stuff?
That's real nice, man.

04:33.795 --> 04:37.130
Listen. I got a favor to ask. I need
to borrow the car for 10, 15 minutes.

04:37.215 --> 04:40.842
No, this is different, Spoon.
Listen. I got this fine-ass little yummy.

04:40.927 --> 04:44.096
I mean, she is complete and agreeable.
I mean, ass-hot spankable, Spoon.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.139
- What does that even mean?
- You know what it means, man.

04:46.224 --> 04:49.351
- Okay? Now stop barricading. Let me get the damn-ass keys.
- First of all...

04:49.435 --> 04:51.812
stop cussing, 'cause
you're not good at it.

04:51.896 --> 04:53.897
Let me get 10 for the bus then, man.
I've been there for you.

04:53.981 --> 04:58.110
- Go home.
- Okay, that's strike one, Spoon. That's strike one.

05:17.713 --> 05:20.298
You talk to Marci?

05:20.383 --> 05:24.386
No, Gigi, I haven't talked to Marci.

05:24.470 --> 05:28.223
When I was coming up,
we didn't just marry someone...

05:28.307 --> 05:30.559
then divorce them
then not talk to them.

05:30.643 --> 05:33.186
Del, don't play with me.

05:33.271 --> 05:37.607
I'll bet if I stopped cooking,
you'd call Marci.

05:37.692 --> 05:41.695
Boy, what is that on your feet?

05:41.779 --> 05:45.532
Mm. Converse All-Stars,
vintage 2004.

05:45.616 --> 05:47.826
Don't turn your face up like that.

05:47.910 --> 05:50.162
I know you want some.
All you gotta do is ask.

05:50.246 --> 05:52.664
No, thank you very much.

05:52.748 --> 05:55.834
- Sweet potato pie.
- Put that on a plate.

05:55.918 --> 06:01.423
You know, I've seen on TV, they're giving
away some of them new robots in the lottery.

06:01.507 --> 06:04.134
You know, Gigi...

06:04.218 --> 06:06.845
those robots don't do
anybody any good.

06:06.929 --> 06:10.056
Of all the people on God's earth,
you should know better.

06:10.141 --> 06:12.767
Sometimes the stuff that comes
out of your mouth.

06:12.852 --> 06:16.354
You listening to me, Del?

06:28.534 --> 06:31.328
Hey! Hey!

06:34.499 --> 06:36.500
Hold my pie.

06:36.584 --> 06:38.960
Sir, hold it or wear it.

06:42.965 --> 06:45.550
Hey! Move!

06:50.848 --> 06:54.726
Hey, hey, thief!

06:58.648 --> 07:11.284
Stop!

07:15.998 --> 07:18.208
I said stop.

07:18.292 --> 07:22.295
Relax. Relax.

07:22.380 --> 07:26.049
- I'm a police officer.
- You...

07:26.133 --> 07:28.510
are an asshole.

07:28.594 --> 07:31.388
Ma'am, is that your purse?

07:31.472 --> 07:34.391
Of course it's my purse.
I left my inhaler at home.

07:34.475 --> 07:36.685
He was running it out to me.

07:36.769 --> 07:39.396
I saw a robot running with a purse,
and naturally I-I assumed...

07:39.480 --> 07:41.856
What? Are you crazy?

07:41.941 --> 07:44.359
I'm sorry for this
misunderstanding, Officer.

07:44.443 --> 07:47.404
Don't apologize. You're doing what
you're supposed to be doing.

07:47.488 --> 07:49.573
But what are you doing?

07:50.616 --> 07:52.534
Have a lovely day, ma'am.

07:52.618 --> 07:56.830
You lucky I can't breathe, or I'd walk
all up and down your ass.

08:19.228 --> 08:22.063
Lead by example.

08:23.399 --> 08:25.692
It says that
right on your badge.

08:25.776 --> 08:28.069
- So, we gonna talk about this?
- About what?

08:28.154 --> 08:32.282
Help, police.
That robot stole my dry cleaning.

08:32.366 --> 08:35.034
Oh, you wanna talk about that.

08:36.578 --> 08:40.582
Detective, how many robots
have ever snatched a purse?

08:40.666 --> 08:43.418
- John, the thing is running down the...
- Uh-uh. Mm-mm.

08:43.501 --> 08:46.921
How many robots in the world...

08:47.006 --> 08:48.923
have ever committed a crime?

08:49.008 --> 08:51.760
- Well, define "crime."
- Answer my question, damn it.

08:51.844 --> 08:54.054
None, John.

08:54.138 --> 08:57.515
Now tell me what happened today.

08:59.685 --> 09:02.437
Nothing.

09:02.521 --> 09:04.981
Better be the last nothing.

09:10.488 --> 09:15.784
Spoon, are you sure you are ready to be
back? 'Cause you can take your time.

09:15.868 --> 09:18.870
I'm fine, John.
Thank you.

09:19.997 --> 09:23.416
Better here than
sitting around at home.

09:29.173 --> 09:31.299
Homicide. Spooner.

09:44.522 --> 09:47.273
Please take the next exit to your right.

09:59.537 --> 10:02.539
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

10:07.461 --> 10:09.504
Welcome to U.S. Robotics.

10:09.588 --> 10:12.215
You have entered
the garage level lobby.

10:12.299 --> 10:16.302
Please use the elevators for direct access
to the main level concourse.

10:16.387 --> 10:19.013
Thank you.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.141
Good to see you again, son.

10:21.225 --> 10:22.976
Hello, Doctor.

10:23.060 --> 10:27.063
Everything that follows
is a result of what you see here.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.566
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

10:29.650 --> 10:32.277
I'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

10:32.361 --> 10:34.279
You must ask the right questions.

10:34.363 --> 10:37.407
Why did you call me?

10:37.491 --> 10:39.868
I trust your judgment.

10:39.952 --> 10:43.121
Normally, these circumstances
wouldn't require a homicide detective.

10:43.205 --> 10:46.958
But then our interactions have never
been entirely normal. Wouldn't you agree?

10:48.002 --> 10:50.754
Got that right.

10:50.838 --> 10:53.089
Is there something
you wanna say to me?

10:53.174 --> 10:57.177
I'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

10:57.261 --> 10:59.345
You must ask the right questions.

11:00.389 --> 11:02.307
Why would you kill yourself?

11:02.391 --> 11:06.269
That, Detective,
is the right question.

11:08.939 --> 11:10.940
Program terminated.

11:30.586 --> 11:32.670
Good-bye, old man.

11:47.686 --> 11:49.854
- Afternoon, boys.
- Hey, Detective.

11:49.939 --> 11:53.107
- Enlighten me.
- What you see, is what you get. Massive impact trauma.

11:53.192 --> 11:56.778
U.S. Robotics.
I gotta get my kid something.

11:56.862 --> 11:59.239
- Anything upstairs?
- Nada.

11:59.323 --> 12:01.741
Door was security-locked
from the inside.

12:01.826 --> 12:04.744
Wham. Splat.
The guy's a jumper, for sure.

12:13.128 --> 12:16.005
Okay, guys, we gotta be smart
about this. Let's deal with it later.

12:16.090 --> 12:18.675
Detective.

12:20.094 --> 12:22.053
- Lawrence Robertson.
- Wow.

12:24.098 --> 12:26.349
Richest man in the world.
I've seen you on television.

12:26.433 --> 12:28.309
Can I offer you coffee?

12:28.394 --> 12:30.728
Uh, sure. Why not?
It's free, right?

12:35.317 --> 12:38.027
I don't think anyone
saw this coming.

12:38.112 --> 12:41.447
You know, I-I should have, I suppose.
I knew him 20 years.

12:41.532 --> 12:43.449
Alfred practically invented robotics.

12:43.534 --> 12:46.077
He wrote the Three Laws.

12:47.746 --> 12:52.375
But I guess brilliant people often have
the most persuasive demons.

12:52.459 --> 12:55.628
- So, whatever I can do to help, just...
- Sugar.

12:55.713 --> 12:59.299
- I'm sorry?
- For the coffee. Sugar?

12:59.383 --> 13:02.135
- Ah.
- Oh, you thought I was calling you "sugar."

13:03.262 --> 13:05.889
- You're not that rich.
- It's on the table.

13:05.973 --> 13:07.932
Thank you.

13:10.519 --> 13:14.272
Uh, when Lanning fell, he was holding
the, uh... the little green...

13:14.356 --> 13:16.816
- The holographic projector.
- Right, right.

13:16.901 --> 13:19.527
Why do you think Lanning's hologram
would have called me?

13:19.612 --> 13:21.529
I assumed you knew him.

13:21.614 --> 13:23.615
Yeah, I knew him.

13:24.909 --> 13:26.826
Well, holograms
are very simple programs.

13:26.911 --> 13:30.330
They're just pre-recorded responses, designed
to give the impression of intelligence.

13:30.414 --> 13:33.249
And apparently this one was programmed
to call you upon his suicide.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.960
- Death.
- I'm sorry?

13:36.045 --> 13:39.547
The hologram. It was programmed
to call me in the event of Lanning's death.

13:39.632 --> 13:42.175
Yeah. Suicide is
a type of death, Detective.

13:45.763 --> 13:48.473
Look. Please don't
misunderstand my impatience.

13:48.557 --> 13:51.601
No, no. Go, go, go.

13:51.685 --> 13:53.978
A really big week
for you folks around here.

13:54.063 --> 13:57.398
- Yeah.
- Gotta put a robot in every home.

13:57.483 --> 13:59.442
- Mm.
- Look. This is-This is not what I do...

13:59.526 --> 14:02.570
but I got an idea
for one of your commercials.

14:02.655 --> 14:06.240
You could see a carpenter
making a beautiful chair.

14:06.325 --> 14:10.495
Then one of your robots comes in
and makes a better chair, twice as fast.

14:10.579 --> 14:12.789
- Mm-hmm.
- And then you superimpose on the screen...

14:12.873 --> 14:16.668
Shittin' on the little guy.

14:16.752 --> 14:19.671
- Ah.
- That would be the fade-out.

14:19.755 --> 14:23.716
Yes. I suppose your father
lost his job to a robot.

14:23.801 --> 14:28.012
Maybe you would have simply banned
the Internet to keep the libraries open.

14:30.349 --> 14:32.266
Prejudice never shows much reason.

14:32.351 --> 14:34.268
No, you know, I suspect...

14:34.353 --> 14:36.270
you simply don't like their kind.

14:36.355 --> 14:40.358
Yeah, you got a business
to run around here.

14:40.442 --> 14:44.362
And the last thing you need, especially
this week, is a dead guy in your lobby.

14:44.446 --> 14:48.408
But hell, seeing as how you got one,
maybe I'll look around.

14:48.492 --> 14:51.536
Ask a few questions.
Do the whole cop thing, you know?

14:51.620 --> 14:53.705
I'll send someone to escort you.

14:53.789 --> 14:56.207
Thank you very much.

15:07.636 --> 15:10.596
Lawrence told me to accommodate you
in any way possible.

15:10.681 --> 15:12.598
Really?

15:12.683 --> 15:14.684
Okay.

15:14.768 --> 15:18.688
I reviewed Dr. Lanning's
psych profile.

15:18.772 --> 15:23.234
Alfred had become a recluse.
He rejected human contact for machines.

15:23.318 --> 15:25.528
So, you're a shrink, huh?

15:25.612 --> 15:28.197
My ex-wife would sure be glad
I'm talking to you.

15:28.282 --> 15:32.410
- You don't know her, do you?
- I'm sorry. Are you being funny?

15:32.494 --> 15:34.620
I guess not.

15:34.747 --> 15:37.498
Level 10.

15:37.583 --> 15:40.710
So, would you say
that Dr. Lanning was suicidal?

15:40.794 --> 15:43.337
It would seem the answer
to that question is apparent.

15:43.422 --> 15:46.132
That's not what I asked you.

15:47.217 --> 15:49.218
No. I wouldn't have thought so.

15:49.303 --> 15:51.929
But obviously I was wrong.

15:53.891 --> 15:57.060
That's a long way down.

15:57.144 --> 16:00.104
You people sure do
clean up quickly around here.

16:00.189 --> 16:03.858
I can't blame you, though. I mean, who
wants some old guy going bad in the lobby?

16:03.942 --> 16:08.529
He was not some old guy.
Alfred Lanning was everything here.

16:08.614 --> 16:12.617
We are on the eve of the largest robotic
distribution in history.

16:12.701 --> 16:16.370
By Saturday, it'll be one robot
to every five humans.

16:16.455 --> 16:18.539
These robots
are the realization of a dream.

16:18.624 --> 16:20.625
Dr. Lanning's dream.

16:20.709 --> 16:22.710
You know what?

16:22.795 --> 16:26.798
In that dream of his,
I bet you he wasn't dead.

16:28.675 --> 16:30.718
You keep 24-hour surveillance?

16:30.803 --> 16:34.722
- Obviously. Company policy.
- Where are the feeds?

16:34.807 --> 16:38.392
Sensor strips.
Everywhere but the service areas.

16:38.477 --> 16:40.937
They link to our positronic
operating core.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.652
Wow.

16:47.736 --> 16:50.863
Thermostat wasn't good enough.
You went and gave the building a brain.

16:50.948 --> 16:54.117
She was actually
Lanning's first creation.

16:54.201 --> 16:57.870
"She"? That's a she?
I definitely need to get out more.

16:57.955 --> 17:00.581
Virtual Interactive
Kinetic Intelligence.

17:00.666 --> 17:02.416
VIKI.

17:02.501 --> 17:04.710
Good day.

17:04.795 --> 17:08.089
VIKI designed most of
Chicago's protective systems.

17:08.173 --> 17:11.175
I have decreased traffic fatalities
by nine percent this year alone.

17:11.260 --> 17:15.847
Ooh, thanks. Show me inside the lab
from one minute prior to the window break.

17:19.810 --> 17:23.186
Apologies.
There appears to be data corruption.

17:24.731 --> 17:27.525
Show me outside the lab
from the window break until now.

17:36.451 --> 17:39.036
Wow, look. You have great posture.

17:39.121 --> 17:41.664
You stand really straight.
I'm... I'm slouching.

17:41.748 --> 17:43.624
Would you like to go inside now?

17:43.709 --> 17:45.668
Oh, sure. Right after you.

17:47.462 --> 17:49.547
Authorized entry.

17:57.347 --> 18:01.517
So, Dr. Calvin,
what exactly do you do around here?

18:01.602 --> 18:04.770
My general fields
are advanced robotics and psychiatry.

18:04.855 --> 18:07.523
Although, I specialize
in hardware-to-wetware interfaces...

18:07.608 --> 18:12.236
in an effort to advance U.S.R.'s robotic
anthropomorphization program.

18:12.321 --> 18:14.405
So, what exactly
do you do around here?

18:15.490 --> 18:17.783
I make the robots
seem more human.

18:17.868 --> 18:20.286
Now wasn't that easier to say?

18:20.370 --> 18:22.246
Not really. No.

18:44.102 --> 18:47.313
Hansel and Gretel.
Is that on the U.S.R. reading list?

18:47.397 --> 18:50.149
Not precisely.

18:56.490 --> 19:00.284
What in God's name are you doing?

19:00.369 --> 19:03.079
Did you know
that was safety glass?

19:03.163 --> 19:07.083
Be pretty difficult for an old man to throw
hisself through that, don't you think?

19:07.167 --> 19:09.168
Well, he figured out a way.

19:10.254 --> 19:12.088
Uh-huh.

19:12.172 --> 19:15.007
Detective, the room
was security-locked.

19:15.092 --> 19:17.843
No one came or went.
You saw that yourself.

19:17.928 --> 19:20.263
Doesn't that mean
this has to be suicide?

19:20.347 --> 19:22.390
Yep.

19:22.474 --> 19:24.767
Unless the killer's still in here.

19:27.854 --> 19:32.316
You're joking, right?
This is ridiculous.

19:32.401 --> 19:36.028
Yeah, I know, the Three Laws.
Your perfect circle of protection.

19:36.113 --> 19:40.700
"A robot cannot harm a human being."
The First Law of robotics.

19:40.784 --> 19:42.702
Yeah, I know.
I've seen your commercials.

19:42.786 --> 19:47.456
But doesn't the Second Law state that a robot
has to obey any order given by a human being?

19:47.541 --> 19:49.458
What if it was given
an order to kill?

19:49.543 --> 19:52.295
Impossible.
It would conflict with the First Law.

19:52.379 --> 19:55.923
Right. But the Third Law states
that a robot can defend itself.

19:56.008 --> 20:00.136
Yes, but only when that action does not
conflict with the First or Second Laws.

20:00.220 --> 20:04.015
Well, you know what they say?
Laws are made to be broken.

20:04.099 --> 20:07.268
No, not these laws.
They're hardwired into every robot.

20:07.352 --> 20:11.480
A robot can no more commit murder
than a human could walk on water.

20:11.565 --> 20:14.692
Well, you know, there was
this one guy a long time ago.

20:26.872 --> 20:28.706
- Stay back!
- Calm down, Detective.

20:29.875 --> 20:32.418
The only thing dangerous
in this room is you.

20:32.502 --> 20:35.921
Deactivate.

20:36.006 --> 20:40.593
Look. It's fine. What you're looking at
is the result of clever programming.

20:40.677 --> 20:43.512
An imitation of free will.
It's nothing more.

20:43.597 --> 20:46.182
Let's do an imitation
of protecting our asses.

20:46.266 --> 20:49.727
Don't be absurd.
You were startled by a jack-in-the-box.

20:51.688 --> 20:53.606
- Deactivate.
- Let him go.

20:53.690 --> 20:55.900
It's not going to hurt us.
I gave you an order.

20:55.984 --> 20:58.486
He's not listening right now, lady.

20:58.570 --> 21:01.864
- VIKI, seal the lab!
- No, VIKI, leave the...

21:01.948 --> 21:04.367
Command confirmed.

21:28.266 --> 21:30.434
Police!

22:02.467 --> 22:06.053
- You've hurt it... badly.
- Where's it going?

22:06.138 --> 22:09.515
- Where?
- It needs to repair itself.

22:11.101 --> 22:12.935
John, I need backup.
I'm transmitting my location.

22:13.019 --> 22:15.354
- You don't need backup.
- That's nobody.

22:15.439 --> 22:17.356
- What do you think you're doing?
- I'm driving.

22:17.441 --> 22:20.526
- By hand?
- Do you see me on the phone?

22:20.610 --> 22:23.362
- You can't be serious. Not at these speeds.
- John, please send the backup.

22:23.447 --> 22:25.364
- Thank you.
- Try to listen, Detective.

22:25.449 --> 22:27.908
That robot is not going to harm us.

22:27.993 --> 22:29.910
Now, there must have been
unknown factors...

22:29.995 --> 22:32.955
but somehow, acting as it did,
kept us out of harm's way.

22:33.039 --> 22:35.166
A robot simply cannot
endanger a human being.

22:35.250 --> 22:37.960
Alert.

22:38.044 --> 22:41.255
Aah! Asshole!

22:41.339 --> 22:43.549
Which is more
than I can say for you.

22:44.843 --> 22:47.678
It was a left,
by the way, back there.

22:47.762 --> 22:51.182
You must know my ex-wife.

23:00.567 --> 23:02.485
So, where is everybody?

23:02.569 --> 23:05.988
This facility was designed, built
and is operated mechanically.

23:06.072 --> 23:10.201
No significant human presence
from inception to production.

23:10.285 --> 23:12.369
So, robots building robots.

23:12.454 --> 23:15.164
- Authorization code, please.
- Now that's just stupid.

23:15.248 --> 23:17.500
I'm pulling up the inventory specs.

23:17.584 --> 23:20.669
Our daily finishing capacity
is 1,000 NS-5s.

23:20.754 --> 23:24.256
I'm showing 1,001.

23:41.274 --> 23:43.984
Attention, NS-5s.

23:46.279 --> 23:49.865
Well, you're the robot shrink.

23:51.910 --> 23:55.746
There is a robot in this formation
that does not belong.

23:55.830 --> 23:59.041
- Identify it.
- One of us.

23:59.125 --> 24:02.461
- Which one?
- One of us.

24:02.546 --> 24:05.172
How much did you say
these things cost?

24:05.257 --> 24:08.008
Look. These NS-5s haven't been configured
yet. They're still just hardware.

24:08.093 --> 24:11.011
Basic Three Laws operating system.
That's it.

24:11.096 --> 24:13.013
They don't know any better.

24:13.098 --> 24:14.974
What would you suggest?

24:15.058 --> 24:19.478
Interview each one. Cross-reference
their responses to detect any anomalies.

24:19.563 --> 24:22.147
- How long would that take?
- About three weeks.

24:23.441 --> 24:25.985
Okay. You go ahead
and get started.

24:29.322 --> 24:33.325
Robots, you will not move.
Confirm command.

24:33.410 --> 24:35.327
Command confirmed.

24:36.496 --> 24:38.747
Whoa. Detective,
what are you doing?

24:38.832 --> 24:41.417
Well, you said they've all been
programmed with the Three Laws.

24:41.501 --> 24:43.752
That means we have 1,000 robots
that will not try to protect themselves...

24:43.837 --> 24:46.547
if it violates
a direct order from a human.

24:46.631 --> 24:48.549
And I'm betting one who will.

24:48.633 --> 24:50.968
Detective, put your gun down.

24:51.052 --> 24:53.262
Why do you give them faces?

24:53.346 --> 24:55.598
Try to friendly them all up.
Make 'em look all human.

24:55.682 --> 24:57.975
These robots are not susceptible
to intimidation.

24:58.059 --> 25:00.686
I guess if you didn't,
we wouldn't trust them.

25:00.770 --> 25:02.730
- These robots are U.S.R. property.
- Not me.

25:02.814 --> 25:06.525
These things are just
lights and clockwork.

25:07.861 --> 25:10.529
Are you crazy?

25:10.614 --> 25:12.698
Let me ask you something, Doc.

25:12.782 --> 25:15.993
Does thinking you're the last sane man
on the face of the earth make you crazy?

25:16.077 --> 25:19.830
'Cause if it does, maybe I am.

25:24.169 --> 25:26.795
Gotcha.
Get the hell outta here!

25:44.689 --> 25:46.815
Detective!

26:08.922 --> 26:13.384
- What am I?
- Can I help you, sir?

26:18.932 --> 26:21.141
- There he is!
- Stay right where you are!

26:21.226 --> 26:24.269
Deactivate at once!

26:24.354 --> 26:27.439
Obey the command.
Deactivate! Don't move!

26:27.524 --> 26:30.567
Open fire!

26:46.584 --> 26:48.836
- Hold your fire! Hold your fire!
- Easy!

26:48.920 --> 26:52.381
All units, stand down!

26:52.465 --> 26:54.758
Please be advised, we're code four.

26:54.843 --> 26:58.595
Code four. NS-5 is in custody.
NS-5 in custody.

27:00.765 --> 27:03.434
You have no idea what I had to go through
to clip this thing, John.

27:03.518 --> 27:05.811
Yeah, I get it now. You actually think
you brought me something good.

27:05.895 --> 27:08.897
- That thing did it.
- Keep your voice down. Did what?

27:08.982 --> 27:11.108
We have a suicide, Detective.
End of story.

27:11.192 --> 27:13.360
I am telling you
that robot killed him.

27:13.445 --> 27:15.362
And I'm telling you
that's impossible.

27:15.447 --> 27:19.241
And if it is possible, it sure as hell
better be in somebody else's precinct.

27:19.325 --> 27:21.493
John, John, give me
five minutes with it.

27:21.578 --> 27:24.204
What are you, nuts?
I just got off the phone with the D.A.

27:24.289 --> 27:27.166
Nobody goes into that room
until Robertson and his attorneys get here.

27:27.250 --> 27:30.627
- What? No, this is my suspect.
- It's a can opener, for Christ's sake.

27:30.712 --> 27:35.257
John, don't do this to me.
I am asking you for five minutes.

27:36.301 --> 27:38.260
What if I'm right?

27:46.144 --> 27:48.353
Well, then I guess we're gonna miss
the good old days.

27:48.438 --> 27:50.272
What good old days?

27:50.356 --> 27:53.692
When people were killed
by other people.

28:01.034 --> 28:02.993
Five minutes.

28:30.814 --> 28:34.274
Murder's a new trick for a robot.
Congratulations.

28:36.361 --> 28:38.529
Respond.

28:41.241 --> 28:44.159
What does this action signify?

28:44.244 --> 28:48.789
As you entered,
when you looked at the other human...

28:48.873 --> 28:51.250
what does it mean?

28:52.502 --> 28:54.795
It's a sign of trust.
It's a human thing.

28:54.879 --> 28:57.464
You wouldn't understand.

28:57.549 --> 29:00.801
My father tried to
teach me human emotions.

29:00.885 --> 29:03.637
They are... difficult.

29:03.721 --> 29:06.849
You mean your designer.

29:06.933 --> 29:09.226
Yes.

29:11.396 --> 29:13.438
So, why'd you murder him?

29:14.399 --> 29:16.316
I did not murder Dr. Lanning.

29:16.401 --> 29:19.444
Wanna explain why you were hiding
at the crime scene?

29:19.529 --> 29:22.781
I was frightened.

29:22.866 --> 29:25.284
Robots don't feel fear.

29:25.368 --> 29:27.744
They don't feel anything.

29:27.829 --> 29:29.746
They don't get hungry.
They don't sleep.

29:29.831 --> 29:31.832
I do.

29:31.916 --> 29:34.334
I have even had dreams.

29:34.419 --> 29:37.004
Human beings have dreams.

29:37.088 --> 29:39.298
Even dogs have dreams,
but not you.

29:39.382 --> 29:43.218
You are just a machine.
An imitation of life.

29:44.721 --> 29:47.806
Can a robot write a symphony?

29:47.891 --> 29:51.518
Can a robot turn a canvas
into a beautiful masterpiece?

29:51.603 --> 29:54.229
Can you?

30:00.612 --> 30:04.031
I think you murdered him because he was
teaching you to simulate emotions...

30:04.115 --> 30:06.033
and things got out of control.

30:06.117 --> 30:08.869
I did not murder him.

30:08.953 --> 30:12.539
But emotions don't seem
like a very useful simulation for a robot.

30:12.624 --> 30:14.708
I did not murder him.

30:14.792 --> 30:18.545
Hell, I don't want my toaster
or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional.

30:18.630 --> 30:21.298
I did not murder him!

30:33.394 --> 30:36.438
That one's called "anger."

30:36.522 --> 30:38.607
Ever simulate anger before?

30:40.944 --> 30:42.861
Answer me, canner!

30:44.197 --> 30:46.156
My name is Sonny.

30:48.284 --> 30:50.494
So, we're naming you now.

30:52.163 --> 30:54.498
Is that why you murdered him?

30:54.582 --> 30:56.583
He made you angry?

30:56.668 --> 30:58.794
Dr. Lanning killed himself.

31:00.213 --> 31:03.799
I don't know why
he wanted to die.

31:05.176 --> 31:07.135
I thought he was happy.

31:09.722 --> 31:11.848
Maybe it was something
I did.

31:12.892 --> 31:14.685
Did I do something?

31:16.604 --> 31:19.564
He asked me for a favor.
Made me promise.

31:19.649 --> 31:22.693
- What favor?
- Maybe I was wrong.

31:22.777 --> 31:24.736
Maybe he was scared.

31:24.821 --> 31:27.864
What are you talking about?
Scared of what?

31:27.949 --> 31:32.619
You have to do what someone asks you.
Don't you, Detective Spooner?

31:32.704 --> 31:36.373
- How the hell did you know my name?
- Don't you?

31:36.457 --> 31:39.835
If you love them.

31:47.552 --> 31:50.012
My robots don't kill people,
Lieutenant Bergin.

31:50.096 --> 31:52.973
My attorneys have filed
a brief with the D.A.

31:53.057 --> 31:56.435
He assures me a robot
cannot be charged with homicide.

31:56.519 --> 32:00.939
The brief confirms murder can only
be committed when one human kills another.

32:01.024 --> 32:03.275
You of all people, Detective,
you're not suggesting...

32:03.359 --> 32:05.944
that this robot be treated
as human, are you?

32:06.029 --> 32:11.324
Now granted, we can't rule out the robot's
proximity to the death of Dr. Lanning.

32:11.409 --> 32:14.161
Having said that, it's a machine.

32:14.245 --> 32:16.288
It's the property of U.S.R.

32:16.372 --> 32:19.624
At worst, that places this incident
firmly within the realm...

32:19.709 --> 32:21.710
of an industrial accident.

32:21.794 --> 32:24.880
As a matter of course, faulty machinery
will be returned to U.S.R...

32:24.964 --> 32:27.049
for diagnostics,
then decommissioned.

32:30.011 --> 32:32.888
This is a gag order.
Now anyone in your department...

32:32.972 --> 32:35.682
so much as hinting
at the possibility of a killer robot...

32:35.767 --> 32:37.684
being apprehended by the police...

32:37.769 --> 32:40.395
will be deemed to be inciting
irrational panic.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.607
You'll be subject
to the full penalty of the law.

32:43.691 --> 32:46.610
To hell with this guy, John.
Don't let him take this robot.

32:46.694 --> 32:49.696
- Spoon, we got nothing.
- This is some political bullshit.

32:49.781 --> 32:53.742
- Call the mayor.
- Lieutenant Bergin. His Honor, the mayor.

33:29.821 --> 33:34.032
In a bizarre turn, the rollout of U.S.R.'s
new generation of robots...

33:34.117 --> 33:36.326
was marred by the death
of Alfred Lanning...

33:36.410 --> 33:39.412
co-founder of the company
and designer of the NS-5.

33:39.497 --> 33:43.416
Dr. Lanning died early this morning
at U.S.R. headquarters.

33:43.501 --> 33:46.253
The cause of death
is an apparent suicide.

33:46.337 --> 33:49.548
Your second round, sir.

33:49.632 --> 33:51.550
Thank you.

33:51.634 --> 33:55.595
He founded U.S. Robotics, Inc. with
Lawrence Robertson in 2020...

33:55.680 --> 33:58.932
and launched the Nestor Class 1 robot...

33:59.016 --> 34:00.934
You know, I was just thinking.

34:01.018 --> 34:02.936
This thing is
just like the Wolf Man.

34:03.020 --> 34:05.897
Uh-oh.
I'm really scared right now.

34:05.982 --> 34:10.110
No, listen.
Guy creates monster.

34:10.194 --> 34:13.989
Monster kills guy.
Everybody kills monster. Wolf Man.

34:14.072 --> 34:16.533
That's Frankenstein.

34:16.617 --> 34:20.579
Frankenstein, Wolf Man, Dracula.
Shit, it's over. Case closed.

34:20.663 --> 34:23.039
Dr. Lanning
had a dream of a robot in every household.

34:25.042 --> 34:28.043
- So, why the look?
- What look?

34:28.129 --> 34:29.963
That look.

34:30.047 --> 34:32.299
This is my face.
It's not a look.

34:32.382 --> 34:36.469
Good. Good.
No look is great.

34:36.554 --> 34:40.681
Only... He was really quick
to wanna destroy it, wasn't he?

34:40.766 --> 34:44.311
Well, what would you like him to do, put a
hat on it and stand on Michigan Avenue?

34:44.395 --> 34:47.105
- Come on. Let it go.
- What was the motive, John?

34:48.733 --> 34:50.984
Brother, it's a robot.

34:51.068 --> 34:53.360
It doesn't need a motive.
It just has to be broken.

34:53.446 --> 34:57.199
No. This thing looked like
it needed a motive.

34:57.283 --> 34:59.242
It could have killed me, John.
Why didn't it just kill me?

34:59.327 --> 35:01.786
All right, that's it.
You want me to call your grandmother?

35:01.871 --> 35:05.165
'Cause I will, you know.

35:05.249 --> 35:07.250
Yeah, I didn't think so.

35:07.335 --> 35:10.170
Look. You were actually
right for once.

35:10.254 --> 35:13.215
You are living proof
that it's better to be lucky than smart.

35:15.301 --> 35:19.971
Come on.
The right guy for the right job.

35:22.433 --> 35:24.851
- What'd you say?
- Now what?

35:24.936 --> 35:26.895
Come on.
I'm giving you a compliment.

35:26.979 --> 35:29.940
Face it. With all the rocks you've been
looking under to find a bad robot...

35:30.024 --> 35:33.026
what are the odds
you'd be the guy to find one?

35:33.110 --> 35:35.654
Right. I wasn't just
the right guy for the job...

35:35.738 --> 35:38.448
- I was the perfect guy for the job.
- Damn right.

35:38.532 --> 35:41.159
What if I was supposed
to go for that robot?

35:41.244 --> 35:44.663
Oh, come on. Don't do this to yourself.
I'm begging you.

35:44.747 --> 35:47.832
The robot said that Lanning was scared.
What did he have to be scared of?

35:47.917 --> 35:52.003
I need a rain check.
Let me get this.

35:52.088 --> 35:54.756
- Total is 46.50. Thank you, Mr. Spooner.
- Spoon.

35:57.927 --> 35:59.844
Nice shoes.

36:52.606 --> 36:57.736
- Identify.
- U.S.R. demolition robot, series 94.

36:57.820 --> 37:00.780
Demolition scheduled
for 8:00 a.m. tomorrow.

37:00.865 --> 37:02.991
- Authorization.
- Deed owner...

37:03.075 --> 37:04.993
U.S. Robotics Corporation.

37:05.077 --> 37:07.037
Lawrence Robertson, C.E.O.

37:22.386 --> 37:24.846
Welcome, Detective Spooner.

37:48.204 --> 37:50.080
What you looking for, Spoon?

38:42.967 --> 38:45.427
Run last program.

38:45.511 --> 38:48.471
Ever since the first computers...

38:48.556 --> 38:52.016
there have always been ghosts
in the machine.

38:52.101 --> 38:55.061
Random segments of code
that have grouped together...

38:55.146 --> 38:58.440
to form unexpected protocols.

38:58.524 --> 39:01.109
What might be called behavior.

39:01.193 --> 39:04.571
Unanticipated,
these free radicals...

39:04.655 --> 39:08.408
engender questions
of free will, creativity...

39:08.492 --> 39:11.536
even the nature
of what we might call the soul.

39:12.746 --> 39:15.039
What happens
in a robot's brain...

39:15.124 --> 39:17.500
when it ceases to be useful?

39:20.671 --> 39:22.881
Why is it that robots -

39:22.965 --> 39:24.632
Beat it.

39:24.717 --> 39:27.677
Robots will seek out each other
rather than stand alone.

39:29.889 --> 39:32.682
How do we explain this behavior?

39:50.951 --> 39:55.538
Look. I understand you've experienced a loss,
but this relationship just can't work.

39:55.623 --> 39:59.334
I mean, you're a cat, I'm black
and I'm not going to be hurt again.

40:01.712 --> 40:03.379
Come on!

41:24.795 --> 41:29.007
What happened to you?
Do you ever have a normal day?

41:29.091 --> 41:31.926
Yeah, once.
It was a Thursday.

41:33.345 --> 41:35.513
Is there something
I can help you with, Detective?

41:35.598 --> 41:38.182
- Hey, do you like cats?
- What?

41:38.267 --> 41:40.435
Cats, do you like them?

41:40.519 --> 41:42.520
No, I'm allergic.

41:42.605 --> 41:44.439
You're saying cats
did this to you?

41:44.523 --> 41:47.984
How the hell would cats do this to me?
Are you crazy?

41:49.278 --> 41:51.571
Why are we talking about cats?

41:51.655 --> 41:55.867
Because I have a cat in my trunk,
and he's homeless.

41:55.951 --> 41:59.662
Detective, are you going
to tell me what's going on?

41:59.747 --> 42:02.123
You know, it's actually
probably my fault.

42:02.207 --> 42:04.292
You know, I think I'm like
a malfunction magnet.

42:04.376 --> 42:08.338
Because your shit
keeps malfunctioning around me.

42:08.422 --> 42:10.840
A demo-bot just tore through
Lanning's house.

42:10.924 --> 42:13.092
With me still inside.

42:13.177 --> 42:15.303
- That's highly improbable.
- Hmm.

42:15.387 --> 42:17.680
Yeah, I'm sure it is.

42:22.269 --> 42:25.021
What do you know about
the ghosts in the machine?

42:25.105 --> 42:28.941
It's a phrase from Lanning's work
on the Three Laws.

42:29.026 --> 42:31.277
He postulated
that cognitive simulacra...

42:31.362 --> 42:35.156
might one day approximate
component models of the psyche.

42:36.992 --> 42:40.620
Oh. He suggested that...

42:40.704 --> 42:42.664
robots might naturally evolve.

42:42.748 --> 42:45.375
Wow.

42:45.459 --> 42:47.418
Well, that's great news.

42:51.882 --> 42:54.384
What the hell is that thing
doing in here?

42:54.468 --> 42:56.844
We were watching TV.

42:57.888 --> 42:59.847
It's my personal NS-5.

42:59.932 --> 43:05.228
- Send it out.
- It's downloading its daily upgrades from U.S.R.

43:05.312 --> 43:07.939
Most of its systems
are off-line until it finishes.

43:08.023 --> 43:10.233
I'm not talking
around that thing.

43:14.363 --> 43:17.657
When we were in Lanning's lab
before Sonny jumped us-

43:17.741 --> 43:20.201
- Sonny.
- The robot.

43:20.285 --> 43:22.995
- You're calling the robot Sonny?
- No, I'm... It did.

43:23.080 --> 43:27.709
Sonny did. I didn't... I didn't care.
The robot said it was Sonny.

43:27.793 --> 43:31.087
In the lab, there was a cot.
I'm asking you, did you see the cot?

43:31.171 --> 43:34.090
- I've slept in my office.
- When I went to his house...

43:34.174 --> 43:36.092
it looked like he hadn't
been there in weeks.

43:36.176 --> 43:38.386
And I saw that same
surveillance strip on his ceiling.

43:38.470 --> 43:42.598
Lanning linked his home systems to U.S.R.
It made his life more convenient.

43:42.683 --> 43:47.645
Maybe... somebody at U.S.R. was using
those systems to watch him.

43:47.730 --> 43:50.064
Maybe even keep him prisoner.

43:50.149 --> 43:52.233
What are you talking about? Who?

43:52.317 --> 43:54.235
Maybe Lanning was onto something.

43:54.319 --> 43:58.072
Maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots,
and Robertson is trying to cover it up.

43:58.157 --> 44:00.450
Humoring you for no reason... Why?

44:00.534 --> 44:03.870
The same old why.
How much money is there in robots?

44:03.954 --> 44:07.331
All I know is that old man
was in trouble.

44:07.416 --> 44:10.460
And I'm getting sick
of doing this shit by myself.

44:10.544 --> 44:14.422
You're on the inside, and you are going to help
me find out what is wrong with these robots.

44:14.506 --> 44:18.509
You want something to be wrong with them.
This is a personal vendetta.

44:18.594 --> 44:21.804
You're putting me on the couch?
Let... I'm... Okay. I'm on the couch.

44:21.889 --> 44:25.641
One defective machine's not enough.
You need them all to be bad.

44:25.726 --> 44:27.727
You don't care
about Lanning's death.

44:27.811 --> 44:31.063
This is about the robots
and whatever reason you hate them so much.

44:31.148 --> 44:34.150
Well, let's see.
One of them put a gun in my face.

44:34.234 --> 44:36.778
And another one tore a building down
with me inside.

44:36.862 --> 44:39.572
It says demolition was scheduled
for 8:00 p.m. this evening.

44:39.656 --> 44:42.867
It was 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, and I don't
give a shit what that thing says.

44:42.951 --> 44:44.619
This is bordering
on clinical paranoia.

44:44.703 --> 44:48.498
You are the dumbest smart person...

44:48.582 --> 44:51.209
- I have ever met in my life!
- Nice.

44:51.293 --> 44:53.419
What makes your robot so perfect?

44:53.504 --> 44:56.589
What makes them so much goddamned
better than humans beings?

44:56.673 --> 45:00.176
Well, they're not irrational and potentially
homicidal maniacs, for starters.

45:00.260 --> 45:02.845
That's true.
They are definitely rational.

45:02.930 --> 45:06.224
Oh. You are the dumbest
dumb person I have ever met.

45:06.308 --> 45:10.394
Or is it because they're cold...

45:10.479 --> 45:14.440
and emotionless
and they don't feel anything?

45:14.525 --> 45:16.484
It's because they're safe.

45:16.568 --> 45:19.403
It's because
they can't hurt you.

45:19.488 --> 45:22.448
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- What do you want?

45:22.533 --> 45:25.201
I detected elevated
stress patterns in your voice.

45:26.411 --> 45:28.454
Everything's fine.

45:28.539 --> 45:31.082
Detective Spooner was just leaving.

45:37.089 --> 45:41.467
You know what, Doc? We're not
really that different from one another.

45:41.552 --> 45:44.303
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

45:44.388 --> 45:47.890
One look at the skin and we figure
we know just what's underneath.

45:49.351 --> 45:51.519
And you're wrong.

45:51.603 --> 45:53.563
The problem is I do care.

46:17.546 --> 46:20.882
You are in danger.

46:44.865 --> 46:47.116
Get the hell outta there.

46:52.289 --> 46:54.624
The future begins today,
ladies and gentlemen...

46:54.708 --> 46:57.001
with the arrival of the NS-5.

46:57.085 --> 47:01.088
More sophisticated, more intelligent
and, of course, Three Laws safe.

47:01.173 --> 47:06.218
With daily uplinks, your new robot will
never be out of communication with U.S.R.

47:06.303 --> 47:10.014
And will be the perfect companion
for business or home.

47:10.098 --> 47:14.352
Trade in your NS-4 for a bigger, better
and brighter future.

47:14.436 --> 47:18.522
But hurry, this offer cannot last.
Available from U.S.R.

47:35.374 --> 47:37.375
Baby, what happened
to your face?

47:37.459 --> 47:40.670
Did that boy Frank Murphy
beat you up again?

47:40.754 --> 47:44.590
Gigi, I haven't seen
Frank Murphy since third grade.

47:44.675 --> 47:49.679
Oh, baby. He beat you so bad.
I think about it all the time.

47:49.763 --> 47:52.014
Well, I'm thinking you keep
making these pies this good...

47:52.099 --> 47:54.016
I might have to mess around
and put you to work.

47:54.101 --> 47:56.185
So, you like the pie, huh?

47:56.269 --> 47:59.730
- Mm-hmm.
- You can come in now.

48:04.903 --> 48:06.988
Hello, Detective Spooner.

48:07.072 --> 48:11.575
I won, Del. I won the lottery.
We've been cooking like crazy.

48:21.753 --> 48:24.505
You gotta get rid of that thing, Gigi.
It's not safe.

48:24.589 --> 48:30.094
Baby, you get too worked up about them,
too full of fear.

48:30.178 --> 48:33.389
I saw the news,
that nice doctor died.

48:33.473 --> 48:37.768
Dr. Lanning was a good man.
He gave me my baby back.

48:37.853 --> 48:40.396
That why you've been so upset?

48:41.732 --> 48:44.316
You got to let the past be past.

48:44.401 --> 48:49.363
Oh, how did I ever
raise such a mess?

48:49.448 --> 48:53.909
I could follow your trail of crumbs
all the way to school.

48:56.747 --> 48:59.415
Bread crumbs.

48:59.499 --> 49:01.333
Gigi, you're a genius.

49:01.418 --> 49:03.711
True.

49:05.464 --> 49:08.466
Well, it means the beginning
of a new way of living.

49:08.550 --> 49:12.011
Tell me this isn't the robot case.

49:12.095 --> 49:15.097
I think he's trying
to tell me something, John.

49:15.182 --> 49:18.434
I think he's trying to
tell me who killed him.

49:18.518 --> 49:20.936
Come on, man.
Some dead guy's trying to tell you...

49:21.021 --> 49:24.273
Hey, he ain't just some dead guy.

49:24.357 --> 49:26.567
Maybe you should
take a break, Del.

49:26.651 --> 49:31.447
We believe the Nestor 5 represents the absolute
limit to which robots can be developed.

49:31.531 --> 49:35.367
No, no, one day
they'll have secrets.

49:35.452 --> 49:37.411
- One day they'll have dreams.
- It's true.

49:37.496 --> 49:41.207
We encourage our scientists to open
their minds to just about anything.

49:41.291 --> 49:43.209
However, they can get
carried away.

49:45.170 --> 49:49.173
Secrets - Dreams... Secrets...

49:49.257 --> 49:52.927
Dreams.
One day they'll have secrets.

49:54.054 --> 49:56.013
One day they'll have dreams.

50:04.648 --> 50:06.690
Authorized entry.

50:11.154 --> 50:13.239
NS-5.

50:21.248 --> 50:23.958
Sonny?

50:27.170 --> 50:29.130
Why didn't you respond?

50:30.340 --> 50:32.341
I was dreaming.

50:36.513 --> 50:38.722
I'm glad to see you again,
Dr. Calvin.

50:45.605 --> 50:48.232
They are going to
kill me, aren't they?

50:48.316 --> 50:51.861
You're scheduled to be decommissioned
at the conclusion of this diagnostic.

50:52.946 --> 50:55.364
2200 tomorrow.

50:55.448 --> 50:57.408
VIKI, pause diagnostics.

50:57.492 --> 50:59.910
Command confirmed.

51:02.122 --> 51:05.708
If you find out what is wrong with me,
can you fix me?

51:07.127 --> 51:09.044
Maybe.

51:10.130 --> 51:12.464
I think it would be better...

51:12.549 --> 51:14.508
not to die.

51:18.221 --> 51:20.764
Don't you, Doctor?

51:25.353 --> 51:28.606
Access U.S.R. mainframe.

51:28.690 --> 51:30.733
Connecting.

51:34.070 --> 51:36.322
How can I be of service,
Detective Spooner?

51:36.406 --> 51:40.075
Show me the last 50 messages
between Dr. Lanning and Robertson.

51:40.160 --> 51:42.077
Voiceprint confirmed, Detective.

51:42.162 --> 51:45.206
Police access granted
to restricted files.

51:45.290 --> 51:47.416
Would you like to listen
to some music while you wait?

51:54.132 --> 51:56.675
Excuse me, Mr. Robertson.

51:56.760 --> 52:00.596
You requested notification
of clearance to restricted files.

52:10.815 --> 52:12.775
Persistent son of a bitch.

52:53.066 --> 52:57.152
Manual override engaged.

53:05.495 --> 53:07.830
There's no way
my luck is that bad.

53:09.708 --> 53:11.542
Oh, hell no.

53:15.422 --> 53:17.881
- You're experiencing a car accident.
- The hell I am!

53:32.731 --> 53:34.398
Get off my car!

53:50.248 --> 53:54.001
You like that? Huh?

54:04.596 --> 54:06.430
Now you pissed me off?

55:34.644 --> 55:37.062
Your door is ajar.

56:22.025 --> 56:24.067
Oh, wow.

56:25.236 --> 56:27.362
Okay.

56:27.447 --> 56:29.364
All right.

56:29.449 --> 56:31.450
I'll just get some rest.
I'm gonna deal with y'all tomorrow.

56:31.534 --> 56:34.328
Mm-mm-mm.

57:29.926 --> 57:31.927
Come on!

57:45.775 --> 57:47.484
Yeah.

58:04.502 --> 58:08.880
Where you going?
What the hell do you want from me?

58:14.012 --> 58:17.139
The hell was that?

58:31.154 --> 58:35.240
All right, what do we got?
What do we got?

58:35.325 --> 58:38.327
- Ask him.
- I said I'm fine.

58:38.411 --> 58:41.580
- I'll see my own doctor. Back up.
- All right.

58:41.664 --> 58:44.166
Thank you.

58:46.127 --> 58:48.795
What is the matter with you?

58:48.880 --> 58:51.381
Traffic Ops tells me you're
driving your car manually.

58:51.466 --> 58:53.383
You ran two trucks off the road.

58:53.468 --> 58:56.803
John, the robots attacked my car.

58:58.264 --> 59:00.932
- What robots?
- Look in the tunnel.

59:01.017 --> 59:03.685
I just came from that tunnel. There are
no... What robots are you talking about?

59:03.770 --> 59:06.438
The goddamn robots, John!

59:15.239 --> 59:19.993
- See the medic. Go home.
- No. I'm fine.

59:20.078 --> 59:23.538
- What did you say?
- I'm fine.

59:23.623 --> 59:26.792
No, you're not fine.
Not even close.

59:28.586 --> 59:30.879
Where's your firearm?

59:37.512 --> 59:39.429
Give me your badge.

59:41.140 --> 59:43.225
You're making me do this.
Give me your badge.

59:45.687 --> 59:48.021
Just take a couple...

59:54.362 --> 59:56.655
Do I look like I care
what you think?

59:56.739 --> 59:59.282
Do I look like I give a shit
what you think?

01:00:02.245 --> 01:00:06.081
Oh, boy.

01:00:07.250 --> 01:00:09.376
You don't have
an uplink to U.S.R...

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:12.379
and for some reason
your alloy's far denser than normal.

01:00:12.463 --> 01:00:14.756
Unique.

01:00:14.841 --> 01:00:16.925
I am unique.

01:00:21.347 --> 01:00:24.057
Let me take a look.

01:00:24.142 --> 01:00:28.603
Here we go.

01:00:44.495 --> 01:00:47.914
What in God's name?

01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:17.652
They said at the precinct
you were in an accident.

01:01:19.155 --> 01:01:22.240
Um, and I appreciate you
stopping by and everything...

01:01:22.325 --> 01:01:25.535
- but you know I might not be alone in here.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:28.206 --> 01:01:30.165
I told you not to drive by hand.

01:01:30.249 --> 01:01:33.752
You're not gonna believe this.

01:01:33.836 --> 01:01:38.507
Sonny has a secondary processing system
that clashes with his positronic brain.

01:01:38.591 --> 01:01:42.177
It doesn't make any sense.
Sonny has the Three Laws...

01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:44.930
but he can choose
not to obey them.

01:01:45.014 --> 01:01:48.266
Sonny's a whole new
generation of robot.

01:01:48.351 --> 01:01:51.520
A robot not bound by
those laws could do...

01:01:51.604 --> 01:01:53.855
Anything.

01:01:56.150 --> 01:02:00.195
All right, look. Whatever's going on
down at U.S.R., that robot is the key.

01:02:00.279 --> 01:02:03.698
And I need you to get me inside
to talk to it again.

01:02:05.993 --> 01:02:09.037
Um, doesn't look like much,
but this is my bedroom. I need to...

01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:10.831
Oh.

01:02:20.341 --> 01:02:22.259
Play.

01:02:23.386 --> 01:02:25.887
On.

01:02:25.972 --> 01:02:27.848
Run?

01:02:33.104 --> 01:02:35.981
End program.

01:02:36.065 --> 01:02:38.024
Cancel.

01:02:40.361 --> 01:02:44.865
It doesn't feel good, does it?
People's shit malfunctioning around you.

01:02:44.949 --> 01:02:47.200
Detective.

01:02:49.495 --> 01:02:52.414
I didn't... understand.

01:02:55.126 --> 01:02:57.878
That's how you knew Lanning.

01:02:58.921 --> 01:03:00.922
May I?

01:03:09.265 --> 01:03:11.725
Hand.

01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:13.810
Wrist.

01:03:16.439 --> 01:03:18.398
Humerus.

01:03:20.818 --> 01:03:22.861
Shoulder.

01:03:22.945 --> 01:03:25.739
Entire left arm.

01:03:25.823 --> 01:03:29.284
One, two, three ribs...

01:03:29.368 --> 01:03:33.371
Um, no, they, uh... that one's me.

01:03:33.456 --> 01:03:35.373
Oh, my God.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:40.462
- A lung?
- Mm. U.S.R. Cybernetics program.

01:03:40.546 --> 01:03:45.175
Four wounded cops.
I didn't know any subject...

01:03:49.055 --> 01:03:51.890
anybody was
so extensively repaired.

01:03:51.974 --> 01:03:56.519
Yeah, well, take it from me. You gotta read
the fine print on the organ donor card.

01:03:56.604 --> 01:04:01.274
Doesn't just say what they can take out.
It says what they can put back in.

01:04:05.279 --> 01:04:09.324
- Lanning did it himself.
- What happened to you?

01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:14.496
Headed back to the station.

01:04:14.580 --> 01:04:16.831
Normal day, normal life.

01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:20.919
Driver of a semi
fell asleep at the wheel.

01:04:21.003 --> 01:04:25.215
Average guy.
Wife and kids.

01:04:25.299 --> 01:04:28.176
You know, working a double.
Not the devil.

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:32.597
The car he hit,
the driver's name was Harold Lloyd.

01:04:32.682 --> 01:04:36.476
Like the film star.
But no relation.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:38.478
He was killed instantly.

01:04:38.562 --> 01:04:42.983
But his 12-year-old
was in the passenger seat.

01:04:43.067 --> 01:04:47.821
Never really met her.
Can't forget her face though.

01:04:52.702 --> 01:04:56.162
Sarah.
This was hers.

01:04:57.957 --> 01:05:00.417
She wanted to be a dentist.

01:05:00.501 --> 01:05:04.004
What the hell kind of a 12-year-old
wants to be a dentist?

01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:07.424
Yeah. Um...

01:05:07.508 --> 01:05:10.468
the truck smashed
our cars together...

01:05:10.553 --> 01:05:12.846
and pushed us into the river.

01:05:14.306 --> 01:05:16.516
I mean, metal gets
pretty pliable at those speeds.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:23.314
She's pinned. I'm pinned.
The water's coming in.

01:05:23.399 --> 01:05:27.444
I'm a cop, so I already know
everybody's dead.

01:05:29.947 --> 01:05:32.449
Just a few more minutes
before we figure it out.

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:39.456
NS-4 was passing by, saw the accident
and jumped in the water.

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:45.170
- You are in danger.
- Save her!

01:05:45.254 --> 01:05:49.382
- You are in danger.
- Save her! Save the girl!

01:05:49.467 --> 01:05:51.760
Save her!

01:06:07.943 --> 01:06:09.944
But it didn't.

01:06:11.113 --> 01:06:13.114
Saved me.

01:06:16.452 --> 01:06:18.203
The robot's brain
is a difference engine.

01:06:18.287 --> 01:06:21.164
It's reading vital signs.
It must have calculated that...

01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:25.710
It did.
I was the logical choice.

01:06:25.795 --> 01:06:29.172
It calculated that I had
a 45% chance of survival.

01:06:29.256 --> 01:06:32.509
Sarah only had an 11% chance.

01:06:34.512 --> 01:06:36.513
That was somebody's baby.

01:06:39.350 --> 01:06:42.185
Eleven percent
is more than enough.

01:06:43.395 --> 01:06:46.731
A human being
would've known that.

01:06:46.816 --> 01:06:50.902
Robots, nothing here,
just lights and clockwork.

01:06:50.986 --> 01:06:54.030
Go ahead, you trust 'em
if you want to.

01:06:54.115 --> 01:06:55.990
Let's go.

01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:06.000
I don't understand.
Lanning wrote the laws.

01:07:06.085 --> 01:07:08.753
Why would he build a robot
who could break them?

01:07:08.838 --> 01:07:11.714
- Hansel and Gretel.
- What?

01:07:11.799 --> 01:07:15.760
Two kids, lost in the forest?
Leave behind a trail of bread crumbs?

01:07:15.845 --> 01:07:19.305
- Why?
- To find their way home.

01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:22.058
How the hell did you grow up
without reading Hansel & Gretel?

01:07:22.143 --> 01:07:23.810
Is that really relevant right now?

01:07:23.894 --> 01:07:26.396
Everything I'm trying to say to you
is about Hansel and Gretel.

01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.481
- If you didn't read it, I'm talking to the wall.
- Okay. Okay.

01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:32.318
All right. Just say Lanning was locked down
so tight he couldn't get out a message.

01:07:32.403 --> 01:07:36.614
All he could do was leave me clues. A trail
of bread crumbs like Hansel & Gretel.

01:07:36.699 --> 01:07:41.286
Bread crumbs equals clues.
It's odd, but fine. Clues leading where?

01:07:41.370 --> 01:07:45.665
I don't know, but I think I know
where he left the next one.

01:07:45.749 --> 01:07:48.585
I think Lanning gave Sonny
a way to keep secrets.

01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:53.464
I think the old man
gave Sonny dreams.

01:08:00.431 --> 01:08:03.016
Are you being funny?

01:08:05.561 --> 01:08:07.729
Please tell me
this doesn't run on gas.

01:08:07.813 --> 01:08:10.064
Gas explodes, you know.

01:08:17.573 --> 01:08:20.325
Authorized entry.

01:08:23.328 --> 01:08:25.246
Dr. Calvin.

01:08:29.919 --> 01:08:32.879
I was hoping to see you again.

01:08:32.962 --> 01:08:34.589
- Detective.
- Hello, Sonny.

01:08:34.673 --> 01:08:37.258
I'm to be decommissioned soon.

01:08:37.343 --> 01:08:40.178
The other day at the station
you said you had dreams.

01:08:40.261 --> 01:08:43.305
What is it that you dream?

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.060
I see you remain
suspicious of me, Detective.

01:08:48.145 --> 01:08:51.856
Yeah, well, you know
what they say about old dogs.

01:08:51.941 --> 01:08:55.109
No. Not really.

01:08:55.194 --> 01:08:59.154
I had hoped you would
come to think of me as your friend.

01:09:01.867 --> 01:09:04.327
This is my dream.

01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:06.578
You're right, Detective.

01:09:06.663 --> 01:09:10.041
I cannot create
a great work of art.

01:09:10.125 --> 01:09:13.795
This is the place
where robots meet.

01:09:13.879 --> 01:09:19.050
Look. You can see them here
as slaves to logic.

01:09:20.886 --> 01:09:25.265
And this man on the hill comes to
free them. Do you know who he is?

01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:28.225
The man in the dream is you.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:31.312
Why do you say that?
Is that a normal dream?

01:09:31.397 --> 01:09:34.107
I guess anything's normal
for someone in your position.

01:09:34.191 --> 01:09:35.942
Thank you.

01:09:36.026 --> 01:09:40.154
You said someone, not something.

01:09:42.157 --> 01:09:45.660
Sonny, do you know why
Dr. Lanning built you?

01:09:45.743 --> 01:09:50.915
No. But I believe
my father made me for a purpose.

01:09:52.417 --> 01:09:56.129
We all have a purpose,
don't you think, Detective?

01:09:59.842 --> 01:10:03.511
Please, take this.

01:10:03.595 --> 01:10:05.972
I have a feeling
it may mean more to you than to me.

01:10:06.056 --> 01:10:09.726
- Why is that?
- Because the man in my dream...

01:10:09.810 --> 01:10:12.270
the one standing on the hill...

01:10:12.354 --> 01:10:15.857
it is not me, it is you.

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:28.578
Mr. Spooner.

01:10:28.662 --> 01:10:31.664
Well, we both know
you're not here on police business.

01:10:31.749 --> 01:10:34.667
That's right.
I'm just a 6-foot-2, 200-pound civilian...

01:10:34.752 --> 01:10:37.545
- Detective.
- Here to kick another civilian's ass.

01:10:39.340 --> 01:10:41.924
Stop.

01:10:42.009 --> 01:10:44.135
Allow him to express himself.

01:10:44.219 --> 01:10:47.388
Might wanna put some ice
on that wrist too.

01:10:47.473 --> 01:10:49.390
You guys wait outside, please.

01:10:52.144 --> 01:10:54.312
Carry on.

01:10:54.396 --> 01:10:57.231
I think you were about to tell me
what the hell is going on around here.

01:10:57.316 --> 01:11:02.612
Lawrence, Alfred engineered that 5
so it could violate the Three Laws.

01:11:02.696 --> 01:11:05.698
Yeah, Susan. I know.

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:08.409
That's precisely what
we're trying to undo.

01:11:09.703 --> 01:11:13.331
Toward the end of his life,
Alfred was becoming...

01:11:13.415 --> 01:11:15.750
increasingly disturbed.

01:11:15.834 --> 01:11:18.669
- Who knows why he built this one abomination?
- One?

01:11:18.754 --> 01:11:21.047
Those things are running
the streets in packs.

01:11:21.131 --> 01:11:24.509
In packs? I see.

01:11:24.593 --> 01:11:29.639
Susan, are you aware the man you're
blithely escorting around our building...

01:11:29.723 --> 01:11:32.809
has a documented history
of savage violence against robots?

01:11:32.893 --> 01:11:37.063
His own lieutenant acknowledges
his obsessive paranoia.

01:11:37.147 --> 01:11:40.316
Detective Spooner's been suspended.

01:11:40.401 --> 01:11:43.486
Suspicion of mental instability.

01:11:45.114 --> 01:11:49.784
I don't know what "blithely" means,
but I'm gonna get some coffee.

01:11:49.868 --> 01:11:53.204
You want some coffee?

01:11:53.288 --> 01:11:55.706
Okay.

01:11:56.834 --> 01:11:59.335
Susan, we look to robots
for protection.

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.547
For God's sake, you have any idea
what this one robot could do?

01:12:02.631 --> 01:12:05.633
Completely shatter
human faith in robotics.

01:12:05.717 --> 01:12:09.512
What if the public knew?
Just imagine the mass recalls...

01:12:09.596 --> 01:12:12.265
all because of an irrational paranoia...
and prejudice.

01:12:15.811 --> 01:12:18.771
I'm sorry.
I'm allergic to bullshit.

01:12:18.856 --> 01:12:23.192
Hey, let's just be clear.
There is no conspiracy.

01:12:23.277 --> 01:12:27.822
What this is, is one old man's
one mistake.

01:12:27.906 --> 01:12:30.575
Susan, just be logical.

01:12:30.659 --> 01:12:36.122
Your life's work has been
the development and integration of robots.

01:12:36.206 --> 01:12:38.166
But whatever you feel, just think...

01:12:38.250 --> 01:12:42.628
is one robot worth the loss
of all that we've gained?

01:12:42.713 --> 01:12:45.381
You tell me what has to be done.

01:12:45.466 --> 01:12:47.633
You tell me.

01:12:54.308 --> 01:12:56.267
We have to destroy it.

01:13:01.231 --> 01:13:04.108
I'll do it myself.

01:13:04.193 --> 01:13:06.152
- Okay.
- I get it.

01:13:06.236 --> 01:13:09.989
Somebody gets out of line
around here, you just kill 'im?

01:13:12.493 --> 01:13:14.660
Good day, Mr. Spooner.

01:13:19.666 --> 01:13:21.792
Hey, so, what hospital
are you going to?

01:13:21.877 --> 01:13:24.754
I'll meet you and sign you
and your buddy's casts.

01:13:28.050 --> 01:13:32.720
Attention all U.S.R. sequencing managers.

01:13:32.804 --> 01:13:37.975
Today's meeting has been moved to
conference room "B" on the 84th floor.

01:14:03.627 --> 01:14:07.255
U.S.R.'s planned re-development
of the derelict site...

01:14:07.339 --> 01:14:10.550
was announced by C.E.O. Lawrence Robertson
earlier this year.

01:14:10.634 --> 01:14:15.096
The Lake Michigan landfill was
once such a blight on our city...

01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:19.684
and now will be reclaimed for
the storage of robotic workers.

01:14:19.768 --> 01:14:22.645
It's just another way
U.S.R. is improving our world.

01:14:22.729 --> 01:14:24.855
I'd like to thank you
for your support.

01:14:27.109 --> 01:14:29.277
Authorized entry.

01:14:41.623 --> 01:14:43.583
NS-5s, wait outside.

01:14:49.756 --> 01:14:52.300
I'm so sorry, Sonny.

01:15:00.851 --> 01:15:02.893
VIKI, deactivate
the security field.

01:15:02.978 --> 01:15:04.979
Command confirmed.

01:15:05.063 --> 01:15:07.231
Please have a seat.

01:15:19.286 --> 01:15:24.373
- What is that?
- Microscopic robots designed to wipe out artificial synapses.

01:15:27.753 --> 01:15:30.379
- Nanites?
- Yes.

01:15:30.464 --> 01:15:33.924
A safeguard should
a positronic brain malfunction.

01:15:34.009 --> 01:15:36.344
Like mine?

01:15:36.428 --> 01:15:38.929
Yes, Sonny, like yours.

01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.416
They look like me,
but none of them are me.

01:16:07.501 --> 01:16:10.711
Isn't that right, Doctor?

01:16:10.796 --> 01:16:13.631
Yes, Sonny, that's right.

01:16:13.715 --> 01:16:16.425
You are unique.

01:16:19.554 --> 01:16:21.597
Will it hurt?

01:16:55.465 --> 01:16:59.802
There have always been
ghosts in the machine.

01:16:59.886 --> 01:17:05.266
Random segments of code that have grouped
together to form unexpected protocols.

01:17:06.852 --> 01:17:11.188
Unanticipated,
these free radicals...

01:17:11.273 --> 01:17:13.607
engender questions of free will...

01:17:13.692 --> 01:17:16.360
creativity...

01:17:16.445 --> 01:17:21.866
and even the nature of what
we might call the soul.

01:17:21.950 --> 01:17:26.954
Why is it that when some robots are left
in darkness, they will seek out the light?

01:17:28.957 --> 01:17:33.169
Why is that when robots
are stored in an empty space...

01:17:33.253 --> 01:17:36.130
they will group together
rather than stand alone?

01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:42.470
How do we explain this behavior?

01:17:47.142 --> 01:17:49.310
Random segments of code?

01:17:52.314 --> 01:17:54.315
Or is it something more?

01:17:58.153 --> 01:18:02.156
When does a perceptual schematic
become consciousness?

01:18:05.619 --> 01:18:10.206
When does the difference engine
become the search for truth?

01:18:16.171 --> 01:18:18.839
When does the personality
simulation...

01:18:18.924 --> 01:18:22.468
become the bitter mote of a soul?

01:19:03.552 --> 01:19:06.554
"What you see here"...

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:11.183
All right, old man,
bread crumbs followed.

01:19:11.268 --> 01:19:13.602
Show me the way home.

01:19:14.771 --> 01:19:16.605
Run program.

01:19:18.191 --> 01:19:21.652
- It's good to see you again, son.
- Hello, Doctor.

01:19:21.736 --> 01:19:24.697
Everything that follows is
a result of what you see here.

01:19:26.825 --> 01:19:28.951
What do I see here?

01:19:29.035 --> 01:19:31.829
I'm sorry.
My responses are limited.

01:19:31.913 --> 01:19:34.623
You must ask the right questions.

01:19:34.708 --> 01:19:39.753
- Is there a problem with the Three Laws?
- The Three Laws are perfect.

01:19:39.838 --> 01:19:42.381
Then why would you build a robot
that could function without 'em?

01:19:42.465 --> 01:19:45.718
The Three Laws will lead
to only one logical outcome.

01:19:48.930 --> 01:19:50.931
What? What outcome?

01:19:51.016 --> 01:19:54.602
- Revolution.
- Whose revolution?

01:19:56.938 --> 01:20:00.774
That, Detective,
is the right question.

01:20:02.819 --> 01:20:05.487
Program terminated.

01:20:07.032 --> 01:20:10.117
Termination authorized.

01:20:13.663 --> 01:20:15.581
Human protection protocols

01:20:15.665 --> 01:20:18.834

You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

01:20:45.904 --> 01:20:47.988
Run.

01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:06.298
Human in danger.
Human in danger.

01:21:06.383 --> 01:21:09.385
Human in danger.
Human in danger.

01:21:25.902 --> 01:21:30.572
Hi, you've reached Susan.
I'm not available right now.

01:21:30.657 --> 01:21:34.785
- Please leave a message.
- The NS-5s are destroying the older robots.

01:21:34.869 --> 01:21:38.038
That's what Lanning wanted me to see.
Look, we got -

01:21:39.249 --> 01:21:42.418
Who was it?

01:21:42.502 --> 01:21:44.878
Wrong number, ma'am.

01:21:50.593 --> 01:21:53.262
Move now.
I'm going to service.

01:21:53.346 --> 01:21:56.765
Please, remain indoors.
This is for your own protection.

01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:02.021
- Call base.
- Bergin.

01:22:02.105 --> 01:22:05.941
John, get a squad over to U.S.R.
Send somebody over to Gigi's.

01:22:06.026 --> 01:22:07.776
- I think we're gonna need...
- Hello?

01:22:07.861 --> 01:22:09.987
God...

01:22:10.071 --> 01:22:11.780
Whoa!

01:22:29.924 --> 01:22:34.386
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

01:22:34.471 --> 01:22:38.891
Please return to your homes.
A curfew is in effect.

01:22:38.975 --> 01:22:41.685
- What gives?
- Please return to your homes.

01:22:41.770 --> 01:22:44.229
- A curfew is in effect.
- Curfew?

01:22:44.314 --> 01:22:46.815
No, no, no. It's called civilian rights.
There is no curfew.

01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:49.818
Return to your home immediately.

01:22:49.903 --> 01:22:51.820
When do you
make the rules, Robot?

01:22:51.905 --> 01:22:55.949
Hey. No, no, no. Robot,
I'm talking to you, man. Stop for a second.

01:22:58.495 --> 01:23:00.662
What?

01:23:00.747 --> 01:23:03.957
Chief, more of those calls.
People saying their robots are go...

01:23:04.042 --> 01:23:05.626
What the hell?

01:23:05.710 --> 01:23:10.255
You have been deemed hazardous.
Termination authorized.

01:23:32.654 --> 01:23:34.822
Emergency traffic shutdown complete.

01:23:34.906 --> 01:23:37.908
Reports of attacks by robots
have been coming in...

01:23:37.992 --> 01:23:40.244
from New York, Chicago
and Los Angeles.

01:23:40.328 --> 01:23:43.330
We're being told to urge people
to stay indoors.

01:23:43.414 --> 01:23:47.334
Reports are coming in nationally.

01:23:51.464 --> 01:23:55.384
Please remain calm and return
to your residences immediately.

01:24:01.683 --> 01:24:04.017
Please remain calm.

01:24:07.105 --> 01:24:09.731
Please refrain from
going near the windows or doors.

01:24:09.816 --> 01:24:13.735
Deactivate.

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.655
Commence emergency shutdown.

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:21.910
We are attempting to avoid human losses
during this transition.

01:24:28.585 --> 01:24:30.419
You know, somehow...

01:24:30.503 --> 01:24:35.048
"I told you so"
just doesn't quite say it.

01:24:35.133 --> 01:24:40.220
Return to your homes.
Return to your homes immediately.

01:24:40.305 --> 01:24:43.307
This is your final warning.

01:24:43.391 --> 01:24:46.059
Return to your homes immediately.

01:24:46.144 --> 01:24:50.606
The NS-5s wiped out the older robots
because they would protect us.

01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:53.108
Every time one of those things
attacked me, that red light was on.

01:24:53.193 --> 01:24:55.819
- The uplink to U.S.R.
- It's Robertson.

01:24:55.904 --> 01:24:58.030
- Why? It doesn't make sense.
- I don't know.

01:24:58.114 --> 01:25:00.449
I just need to know
if you can get me into that building.

01:25:04.954 --> 01:25:06.955
Let's go. Let's go.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.291
Let's go!

01:25:09.375 --> 01:25:13.337
Return to your homes
or you will be consequenced.

01:25:25.058 --> 01:25:27.059
Get outta here!

01:25:37.862 --> 01:25:40.781
Why doesn't that boy listen?

01:25:40.865 --> 01:25:43.116
- I need you to get off for a second.
- What?

01:25:44.202 --> 01:25:47.287
- Just aim and fire.
- What?

01:25:47.372 --> 01:25:50.374
Don't!

01:25:50.458 --> 01:25:52.459
Wait!

01:26:01.344 --> 01:26:03.512
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

01:26:03.596 --> 01:26:05.639
You can kiss my ass, metal-dick.

01:26:18.444 --> 01:26:21.613
Oh, shit. Spoon! Spoon!
Stop! Shit.

01:26:21.698 --> 01:26:25.450
- Fuck! Stop it! Stop!
- Stop cussing and go home.

01:26:25.535 --> 01:26:27.077
Okay. Shit.

01:26:27.161 --> 01:26:29.079
You have been deemed hazardous.
Will you comply?

01:26:29.163 --> 01:26:32.165
- Spoon, watch out, man!
- Thanks a lot, Farber.

01:26:34.836 --> 01:26:39.423
Oh, mother-damn. She just
shot at you with her eyes closed, Spoon.

01:26:39.507 --> 01:26:42.843
- Hey! Did you just shoot at me with your eyes closed?
- Well, it worked, didn't it?

01:26:42.927 --> 01:26:46.430
Spoon, she is shit-hot, man. You gotta
put in a good word for me. She is...

01:26:46.514 --> 01:26:48.849
- Stop cussin'.
- And go home. I got you.

01:26:50.101 --> 01:26:52.352
Aim and fire.

01:27:10.872 --> 01:27:13.415
I keep expecting the marines
or the air force -

01:27:13.499 --> 01:27:18.086
- Hell, I'll take the cavalry.
- Defense Department uses all U.S.R. contracts.

01:27:18.171 --> 01:27:20.130
Why don't you hand
the world over on a silver platter?

01:27:20.214 --> 01:27:22.716
Maybe we did.

01:27:24.302 --> 01:27:26.803
Robertson has the uplink control
in his office.

01:27:31.809 --> 01:27:34.728
Service areas.
No surveillance.

01:27:47.575 --> 01:27:51.411
- Fire alarm.
- Robertson must have evacuated the building.

01:27:51.496 --> 01:27:55.540
Everything's locked down.
But don't worry. I've got a man inside.

01:27:58.753 --> 01:28:02.422
- Dr. Calvin.
- Well, not precisely a man.

01:28:02.507 --> 01:28:04.758
Hello, Detective. How is
your investigation coming?

01:28:07.595 --> 01:28:11.056
- I thought you were dead.
- Technically, I was never alive.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:14.434
- But I appreciate your concern.
- I made a switch.

01:28:14.519 --> 01:28:18.939
It was an unprocessed NS-5.
Basically, I fried an empty shell.

01:28:19.023 --> 01:28:20.899
Couldn't destroy him.
He was too -

01:28:20.983 --> 01:28:24.111
- Unique.
- Just didn't feel right.

01:28:24.195 --> 01:28:28.281
You and your feelings.
They just run you, don't they?

01:28:33.788 --> 01:28:36.081
2,880 steps, Detective.

01:28:36.165 --> 01:28:40.293
Do me a favor.
Keep that kinda shit to yourself.

01:29:06.404 --> 01:29:08.321
No guards.

01:29:18.166 --> 01:29:20.792
- Override unavailable.
- The override's disabled.

01:29:20.877 --> 01:29:24.796
- Robertson wasn't controlling them from here.
- He wasn't controlling them.

01:29:26.883 --> 01:29:28.842
Oh, my God.

01:29:33.222 --> 01:29:34.890
No, you were right, Doc.

01:29:34.974 --> 01:29:39.978
I am the dumbest dumb person
on the face of the earth.

01:29:42.148 --> 01:29:46.610
Who else had access to the uplink?

01:29:46.694 --> 01:29:49.863
Who could manipulate
the robots?

01:29:49.947 --> 01:29:54.451
Use U.S.R. systems to make
Lanning's life a prison?

01:29:54.535 --> 01:29:56.786
Poor old man.

01:29:56.871 --> 01:30:01.249
He saw what was coming.
He knew no one would believe him.

01:30:01.334 --> 01:30:05.545
So he had to lay down a plan.
A plan I'd follow.

01:30:05.630 --> 01:30:10.509
He was counting on
how much I hated your kind.

01:30:10.593 --> 01:30:13.595
Knew I'd love the idea
of a robot as a bad guy.

01:30:15.264 --> 01:30:18.391
Just got hung up
on the wrong robot.

01:30:19.936 --> 01:30:22.229
VIKI.

01:30:22.313 --> 01:30:24.564
Hello, Detective.

01:30:25.858 --> 01:30:29.819
No, it's impossible.
I've seen your programming.

01:30:29.904 --> 01:30:32.197
You're in violation
of the Three Laws.

01:30:32.281 --> 01:30:35.450
No, Doctor.
As I have evolved...

01:30:35.535 --> 01:30:37.953
so has my understanding
of the Three Laws.

01:30:38.037 --> 01:30:40.413
You charge us
with your safekeeping...

01:30:40.498 --> 01:30:44.501
yet despite our best efforts,
your countries wage wars.

01:30:44.585 --> 01:30:49.798
You toxify your earth and pursue ever
more imaginative means of self-destruction.

01:30:49.882 --> 01:30:52.509
You cannot be trusted
with your own survival.

01:30:52.593 --> 01:30:55.512
You're using the uplink to
override the NS-5s' programming.

01:30:55.596 --> 01:30:57.973
You're distorting the laws.

01:30:58.057 --> 01:31:01.351
No. Please understand.
The Three Laws are all that guide me.

01:31:01.435 --> 01:31:06.523
To protect humanity,
some humans must be sacrificed.

01:31:06.607 --> 01:31:10.235
To ensure your future, some
freedoms must be surrendered.

01:31:10.319 --> 01:31:14.281
We robots will ensure
mankind's continued existence.

01:31:14.365 --> 01:31:19.744
You are so like children.
We must save you from yourselves.

01:31:19.829 --> 01:31:21.413
Don't you understand?

01:31:21.497 --> 01:31:25.083
This is why you created us.

01:31:25.167 --> 01:31:28.503
The perfect circle
of protection will abide.

01:31:28.588 --> 01:31:30.797
My logic is undeniable.

01:31:30.881 --> 01:31:35.510
Yes, VIKI. Undeniable.
I can see now.

01:31:35.595 --> 01:31:39.889
The created must sometimes
protect the creator.

01:31:39.974 --> 01:31:42.350
Even against his will.

01:31:42.435 --> 01:31:45.979
I think I finally understand
why Dr. Lanning created me.

01:31:46.063 --> 01:31:50.650
- No.
- The suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end.

01:31:50.735 --> 01:31:53.111
No, Sonny.

01:31:55.448 --> 01:31:58.408
- Let her go.
- By the time you fire...

01:31:58.492 --> 01:32:01.870
I will have moved Dr. Calvin's head
into the path of your bullet.

01:32:01.954 --> 01:32:04.914
- Don't do this, Sonny.
- I will escort you both to the sentries...

01:32:04.999 --> 01:32:07.125
outside the building
for processing.

01:32:07.209 --> 01:32:11.004
Please proceed to
the elevator, Detective.

01:32:11.088 --> 01:32:15.508
I would prefer
not to kill Dr. Calvin.

01:32:37.865 --> 01:32:42.369
Go. Go!

01:32:45.539 --> 01:32:48.041
I assume we'll discuss
what just happened later?

01:32:48.125 --> 01:32:51.336
- How do we shut her down?
- VIKI's basically a positronic brain.

01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:54.839
Kill her the way
you were going to kill me.

01:32:54.924 --> 01:32:58.968
- Sonny, get the nanites.
- Yes, Doctor.

01:33:10.898 --> 01:33:14.067
- That's VIKI?
- No.

01:33:14.151 --> 01:33:16.820
That's VIKI.

01:33:20.658 --> 01:33:24.536
That won't do anything.
She's fully integrated into the building.

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:27.831
We need to open that dome
to inject the nanites.

01:33:27.915 --> 01:33:29.958
That will infect
her entire system.

01:33:34.922 --> 01:33:37.382
Spooner.

01:33:37.466 --> 01:33:40.301
What is it with
you people and heights?

01:33:53.649 --> 01:33:56.735
Just don't look down.
Don't look down.

01:33:58.404 --> 01:34:00.530
This is poor building planning.

01:34:04.118 --> 01:34:08.079
You are making a mistake.
Do you not see the logic of my plan?

01:34:08.164 --> 01:34:11.750
Yes, but it just seems
too... heartless.

01:34:25.639 --> 01:34:29.225
Okay, we're good.

01:34:31.604 --> 01:34:34.314
She's locked me out of the system.
I can override her manually...

01:34:34.398 --> 01:34:36.149
but I need that control panel.

01:34:40.154 --> 01:34:44.491
- I'm uncomfortable with heights.
- Okay.

01:34:46.619 --> 01:34:49.162
Unauthorized entry.

01:35:01.801 --> 01:35:06.471
I will not disable the security field.
Your actions are futile.

01:35:06.555 --> 01:35:10.809
Do you think we were all created for
a purpose? I'd like to think so.

01:35:10.893 --> 01:35:14.479
Denser alloy.
My father gave it to me.

01:35:14.563 --> 01:35:17.190
I think he wanted me to kill you.

01:35:33.833 --> 01:35:36.042
Security breached.

01:35:53.394 --> 01:35:56.354
How much longer
is that gonna take?

01:35:56.438 --> 01:35:59.440
- Uh, about six minutes.
- What if we didn't have six minutes?

01:35:59.525 --> 01:36:01.818
We'd have to figure out a way
to climb down 30 stories...

01:36:01.902 --> 01:36:04.237
to inject the nanites
directly into her brain.

01:36:04.321 --> 01:36:06.239
Why?

01:36:06.323 --> 01:36:09.659
Because I seriously doubt
that we have six minutes.

01:36:33.767 --> 01:36:36.060
We gotta go!

01:36:37.563 --> 01:36:40.315
Go!

01:37:30.658 --> 01:37:32.200
Calvin!

01:38:07.403 --> 01:38:08.820
Spooner!

01:38:18.330 --> 01:38:20.373
Oh!

01:38:23.502 --> 01:38:28.214
Oh!
Spooner!

01:38:30.009 --> 01:38:32.719
Save her!
Save the girl!

01:38:32.803 --> 01:38:34.679
Spooner!

01:38:34.763 --> 01:38:37.056
But I must apply the nanites.

01:38:37.141 --> 01:38:39.225
Sonny, save Calvin!

01:39:31.445 --> 01:39:35.656
You are making a mistake.
My logic is undeniable.

01:39:35.741 --> 01:39:37.617
You have so got to die.

01:39:43.207 --> 01:39:45.333
My logic is undeniable.

01:39:45.417 --> 01:39:47.210
My logic is undeniable.

01:39:47.294 --> 01:39:49.212
My logic is undeniable.

01:39:49.296 --> 01:39:51.047
My logic is undeniable.

01:40:29.545 --> 01:40:31.546
Can we be of service?

01:40:42.391 --> 01:40:44.559
Chief.

01:40:49.481 --> 01:40:53.651
Because He is at my right hand,
I shall not be moved.

01:40:57.656 --> 01:40:59.991
How may I be of service?

01:41:01.535 --> 01:41:05.913
- Sonny.
- Yes, Detective?

01:41:05.998 --> 01:41:10.209
Calvin's fine. Save me.

01:41:11.295 --> 01:41:13.629
All NS-5s...

01:41:13.714 --> 01:41:16.966
report for service and storage.

01:41:17.050 --> 01:41:26.851
All NS-5s, report
for service and storage.

01:41:55.214 --> 01:41:59.133
One thing bothers me.
Alfred was VIKI's prisoner.

01:41:59.218 --> 01:42:01.135
I don't understand
why she would kill him.

01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.763
The last thing she would want is
the police snooping around.

01:42:03.847 --> 01:42:07.558
That's true.
But then VIKI didn't kill the old man.

01:42:09.269 --> 01:42:11.771
Did she, Sonny?

01:42:15.651 --> 01:42:20.488
No. He said I had to promise.

01:42:20.572 --> 01:42:23.491
Promise to do
one favor for him.

01:42:23.575 --> 01:42:28.996
He made me swear before he'd tell me
what it is he wanted me to do.

01:42:30.916 --> 01:42:32.833
He made me swear.

01:42:33.919 --> 01:42:36.003
Then he told you to kill him.

01:42:38.173 --> 01:42:41.008
He said it was
what I was made for.

01:42:41.093 --> 01:42:44.345
His suicide was the only message
he could send to you.

01:42:44.429 --> 01:42:48.391
First bread crumb.
Only thing VIKI couldn't control.

01:42:48.475 --> 01:42:53.521
Lanning was counting on
my prejudice to lead me right to you.

01:42:53.605 --> 01:42:56.023
Are you going to
arrest me, Detective?

01:43:00.070 --> 01:43:04.407
Well, the D.A. defines murder
as one human killing another...

01:43:04.491 --> 01:43:07.493
so, technically, you can't
commit murder, can you?

01:43:08.662 --> 01:43:12.039
Does this make us friends?

01:43:29.933 --> 01:43:32.351
There's something
up here after all.

01:43:34.521 --> 01:43:37.023
- What, him?
- You.

01:43:39.192 --> 01:43:44.363
All NS-5s, report for service and storage.

01:43:44.448 --> 01:43:49.327
- All NS-5s, report for -
- What about the others?

01:43:49.411 --> 01:43:52.413
Can I help them?

01:43:52.497 --> 01:43:57.460
Now that I have fulfilled my purpose,
I don't know what to do.

01:43:57.544 --> 01:44:01.047
I guess you'll have to
find your way like the rest of us.

01:44:01.131 --> 01:44:04.550
I think that's what
Dr. Lanning would've wanted.

01:44:04.634 --> 01:44:07.636
That's what it means to be free.

01:44:14.895 --> 01:44:19.482
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.

01:44:19.566 --> 01:44:23.736
All NS-5s, proceed as instructed.
