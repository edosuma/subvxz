‐ The future Alex is relentless.

14:14.897 --> 14:18.859
If he can't get to one of us,
he's gonna go after someone we care about.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.444
‐ Like Julie?

14:22.779 --> 14:24.031
‐ Who's Julie?

14:32.247 --> 14:34.249
JULIE:
Oh, hi, um...

14:34.249 --> 14:36.376
Alex, right?
‐ No, yeah, yeah.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.545
We met at Karolina's birthday party
at the karaoke bar?

14:38.545 --> 14:40.047
I was the one singing Backstreet Boys.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.090
‐ Oh, I thought it was N'Sync.

14:42.466 --> 14:43.800
‐ Pfft! Long time ago.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.552
‐ [laughs] It was in February.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.597
‐ You know, I'm actually
really glad I caught you.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.390
I wanted to leave
something for Karolina,

14:50.390 --> 14:51.934
but I didn't want
to leave it at the front door.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.227
‐ Well, she's in class,

14:53.227 --> 14:55.771
so you can give it to me
and I'll pass it along.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.689
‐ It's kind of personal.

14:57.689 --> 15:00.150
Uh, I kind of wanted
to give it to her myself.

15:00.859 --> 15:04.321
‐ Okay. Well, she will be home
in about an hour,

15:04.321 --> 15:07.616
so if you wanna come back,
then, yeah, or text her.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.076
‐ Mind if I wait?

15:09.076 --> 15:12.037
Um... it's really important.

15:14.206 --> 15:17.125
‐ How about I just text her right now
and we'll see what's best?

15:17.125 --> 15:19.545
‐ You know, I'll... I'll give it to you.
Forget about it.

15:19.545 --> 15:21.964
You can, uh... you can go ahead
and give it to her.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.924
‐ Yeah, great. Okay.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.677
Did you change your hair or something?
Something's different.

15:26.677 --> 15:28.762
‐ Yeah. It's a new look for me.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.433
‐ Oh, my God, Julie.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.978
ALEX:
I'm sorry, Karolina.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.229
This is the only way.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.772
‐ Why are you doing this?

15:38.772 --> 15:40.732
‐ Self‐pre... pres...

15:40.732 --> 15:43.402
[crackling noise]

15:47.114 --> 15:48.282
[Alex gasping]

15:48.282 --> 15:50.033
‐ You really thought she
was gonna come alone?

15:50.033 --> 15:52.327
We're still a team, traitor.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.955
‐ Put the gun down,
or this is about to get a lot worse.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.290
[gasping]

16:04.256 --> 16:05.382
‐ Where is it?

16:05.382 --> 16:07.718
‐ Shit. Must have forgot
to put it on this morning.

16:07.718 --> 16:10.220
‐ Don't screw with me, Wilder.
Where is it?!

16:11.680 --> 16:14.308
‐ Chase never did learn
to control that temper.

16:14.308 --> 16:15.475
[beeping]

16:15.851 --> 16:18.228
‐ No!
‐ Oh, shit, what just happened?

16:18.228 --> 16:19.897
‐ He just time‐jumped.
‐ Wait, where did he go?

16:19.897 --> 16:20.814
‐ Just give me a minute.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.858
Maybe I can trace him
using a quantum backup system.

16:24.610 --> 16:27.863
‐ Uh... time‐jumping quantum what?

16:28.322 --> 16:29.907
How hard did I hit my head?

16:32.492 --> 16:35.037
You guys got together for your friend.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.331
That's nice.
‐ Here.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.502
‐ I feel like you took my advice.

16:41.502 --> 16:44.129
‐ I'm Nico.
I don't think we've met yet.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.798
‐ Uh, Nico, hi.

16:46.798 --> 16:49.676
Um... Yeah, I've heard
so much about you.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.597
I... would love to catch up sometime.

16:54.348 --> 16:57.142
‐ Yeah. Uh, can't wait.
‐ Come on.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.985
‐ What? I'm fine.

17:07.486 --> 17:08.862
She seems great.

17:09.821 --> 17:12.449
‐ Can I come in now?
I don't hear anyone who sounds like me.

17:12.824 --> 17:14.618
‐ Coast is clear, unfortunately.

17:15.619 --> 17:19.081
‐ [sighs] So, you guys
met the future me.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.041
I'm not that bad, am I?

17:21.041 --> 17:23.460
‐ You pistol‐whipped
Karolina's girlfriend.

17:23.877 --> 17:27.256
‐ Wow, okay, but I didn't shoot her,
so there's hope.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.590
NICO:
Wait, so, um...

17:30.092 --> 17:31.802
Julie's her actual girlfriend?

17:31.802 --> 17:34.263
Not just like roommates?

17:34.721 --> 17:38.642
‐ You were gone for three years, Nico.
And no one knew where you were.

17:39.601 --> 17:41.770
‐ Yeah, I know. I was just, um...

17:42.145 --> 17:44.064
[laughs] I was just making sure.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.818
JULIE:
So, that's Nico.

17:49.152 --> 17:51.113
What does it mean that she's back?

17:52.406 --> 17:53.907
‐ For you and me?

17:54.533 --> 17:55.701
Nothing.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.830
I'm committed to you now.
I hope that you know that.

18:01.498 --> 18:05.711
But it does mean that there's something
I have to do with my friends because...

18:06.670 --> 18:10.591
if anything ever happened to you,
I would never forgive myself.

18:14.178 --> 18:17.097
‐ After this is all over, Julie and I
are going to take a Disney cruise

18:17.097 --> 18:18.974
and have a very long talk.

18:18.974 --> 18:20.475
MOLLY:
[laughing] Can I come?

18:20.475 --> 18:21.894
CHASE:
Oh, no.

18:22.311 --> 18:23.687
‐ Well, that doesn't sound good.

18:24.313 --> 18:25.522
It seems like he's gone back to the day

18:25.522 --> 18:28.025
before we discovered
our parents in the basement.

18:28.025 --> 18:30.027
‐ That's before we knew about our powers.

18:30.027 --> 18:32.196
‐ Before we became friends again.
‐ We were at our weakest.

18:32.196 --> 18:34.114
‐ That version of us
doesn't stand a chance.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.575
‐ We gotta save them, save ourselves.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.786
‐ Here.
‐ And these are?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.747
‐ Your own personal time machines.

18:42.372 --> 18:44.458
Who's ready to go back to high school?

18:51.173 --> 18:52.508
[energy pulsing]

18:52.508 --> 18:54.134
[sparking]

18:54.134 --> 18:57.262
‐ [laughing]
‐ Oh, shit!

18:57.262 --> 18:58.639
Oh!

18:58.639 --> 18:59.932
I feel nauseous.

18:59.932 --> 19:02.726
‐ Well, that's because you just went
in reverse around a donut‐shaped vacuum

19:02.726 --> 19:04.436
where spacetime can get bent upon itself

19:04.436 --> 19:07.648
using focused gravitational fields
to form a closed timeline curve.

19:08.106 --> 19:10.651
‐ And this watch did that?
‐ Yes, it did.

19:10.651 --> 19:12.528
ALEX:
You really figured it out.

19:12.528 --> 19:14.029
CHASE:
Don't act so surprised.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.322
And don't touch that.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.366
You don't want to accidentally end up
somewhere that you hadn't planned.

19:17.366 --> 19:19.284
And if you touch someone
or something when it activates,

19:19.284 --> 19:20.536
it's all going with you.

19:20.536 --> 19:22.663
Okay, there's enough power
in each one of these for four jumps.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.498
I'm down to two and so is future Alex.

19:24.498 --> 19:26.542
He's going to need one to return
to his original timeline.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.627
‐ Oh, so he can't jump back
whenever he wants.

19:28.627 --> 19:32.005
‐ Or he'll get stranded.
‐ Can't believe he came here to hunt us.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.423
‐ And we had no idea he was coming.

19:33.423 --> 19:36.051
‐ It's efficient, devious.
Typical Wilder.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.512
‐ Okay, really?
Can we turn off the comments section,

19:38.512 --> 19:40.180
because the troll factor's
pretty high right now.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.890
‐ Okay, you all remember
where you were on this day.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.517
Go find yourselves, go guard them.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.435
Lay low, try not to change
anything that happened,

19:45.435 --> 19:48.313
and under no circumstance are you
to interact with your former version.

19:48.313 --> 19:51.024
I have no idea what type of time paradox
that could create.

19:51.024 --> 19:52.150
[school bell rings]

19:52.150 --> 19:53.777
We get Alex, we get out.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.112
Come on.

20:01.285 --> 20:03.704
BRAYDEN:
Yo, it's gonna be a kick‐ass season, bro.

20:03.704 --> 20:06.081
‐ Hell yeah. I'm gonna rip
so many more G's in you this year.

20:06.081 --> 20:08.000
‐ Yo, I'm gonna rip way more G's in you.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.335
‐ Pfft! Not with that lame‐ass
Evo Classic.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.463
‐ I will take my Classic
over your Pro any day, bro.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.717
LUCAS: Bullshit. The only thing shorter
than the shaft on your Evo Classic is...

20:16.717 --> 20:19.094
KAROLINA: Hi, guys.
Hope you had a good practice today.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.513
CHASE: Hey, thanks.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

20:21.513 --> 20:23.765
BRAYDEN: Oh, hey,
when we win our game tonight,

20:23.765 --> 20:24.892
we'll call you to celebrate.

20:24.892 --> 20:28.478
‐ Aw, thanks, but I can't. Church stuff.
Journey into brightness.

20:31.315 --> 20:34.318
‐ Sorry, dude, we tried.
‐ Tried what?

20:36.069 --> 20:38.113
Look, dude, I do not like Karolina Dean.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.574
LUCAS:
Don't worry, we won't tell Eiffel.

20:40.574 --> 20:41.825
[Lucas chuckles]

20:46.413 --> 20:47.998
‐ Oh, I remember this.

20:47.998 --> 20:49.499
Oh, no, don't open it!

20:54.254 --> 20:56.465
‐ Oh, cool. [laughs]

20:56.465 --> 20:57.591
[scattered laughter]

20:57.591 --> 20:59.593
I'm the light. Yeah, I get it.

20:59.593 --> 21:01.136
Very funny.

21:03.388 --> 21:07.559
‐ Or they're persecuting you
for your religious beliefs, so not funny.

21:07.559 --> 21:10.020
‐ I thought you said Gibborim
wasn't a religion.

21:10.020 --> 21:13.023
GERT: Fair point.
The lightbulb thing's still mean, though.

21:13.023 --> 21:15.025
And I'm sorry... about that.

21:15.025 --> 21:16.527
KAROLINA: Yeah, well...

21:16.527 --> 21:18.654
I can't blame them for not
knowing what they don't know.

21:20.405 --> 21:22.699
‐ Well, uh, that's actually
called ignorance,

21:22.699 --> 21:24.660
and it's totally okay
to blame them for it.

21:25.619 --> 21:28.664
Hey, I'm actually starting
this club on campus.

21:28.664 --> 21:32.835
Uh... "Undermining Patriarchy."
I can add this episode to the agenda.

21:32.835 --> 21:35.254

‐ I gotta find a janitor.

21:36.839 --> 21:37.798
[gasps]

21:38.340 --> 21:39.591
‐ Right, yeah.

21:39.591 --> 21:42.261
Now, who'd wanna hang out with, uh...

21:42.928 --> 21:44.680
intelligent, confident women

21:44.680 --> 21:47.432
challenging institutional
power structures?

21:47.432 --> 21:49.226
So boring.

21:51.311 --> 21:52.646
‐ Gert! Gert, Gert!

21:52.646 --> 21:55.983
Hey! So listen, I've got
dance class audition tomorrow.

21:56.525 --> 21:57.985
‐ I'm so sorry to hear that.

21:57.985 --> 21:59.987
‐ But it's really important to me.

21:59.987 --> 22:04.283
‐ And I find that profoundly sad,
like I have failed you in some way.

22:04.283 --> 22:06.577
‐ Well, um, you can make it up to me.

22:06.577 --> 22:09.830
Um, Eiffel, she's in charge
and she's in your class,

22:09.830 --> 22:11.665
and maybe you could put in
a good word for me.

22:11.665 --> 22:14.251
‐ Oh, no, no, no. You do not want me
lobbying on your behalf

22:14.251 --> 22:15.544
to any cheerleader.

22:15.544 --> 22:18.547
It would just go really terribly
for both me and them.

22:18.547 --> 22:20.924
And also you don't need to find validation

22:20.924 --> 22:23.302
in the opinions of the vapid
and self‐obsessed.

22:23.302 --> 22:24.595
‐ That's okay.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.180
‐ Never mind.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.600
[sighs] This is important to you.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.602
So I will extol your virtues

22:31.602 --> 22:35.564
to anyone who will listen,
even if they have pom poms. Okay.

22:35.564 --> 22:37.649
‐ Thanks, sis!
You're the best!

22:37.649 --> 22:41.320
Um, by the way, it's the dance squad,
so it's like no pom poms.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.655
But I love you. Okay. Bye.
‐ Great. Cool.

‐ Uh, excuse me, could you give me a hand
on the cord there at the end of this?

23:14.353 --> 23:16.021
There's a cord and it's stuck to...

23:16.980 --> 23:19.983
Uh, the cord, it's right there at the end.
If you could grab that.

No one appreciates the AV club.

Oh, sad?

24:51.116 --> 24:54.119
Try justifiably furious.

24:54.119 --> 24:57.539

‐ [laughing]
‐ I think she's beautiful.

25:05.005 --> 25:07.674
‐ You do?
‐ You do?

25:08.383 --> 25:10.636
LUCAS: Where did
the five o'clock shadow come from?

25:10.636 --> 25:13.180
BRAYDEN:
Whoa, lay off the HGH, dude.

25:14.848 --> 25:17.309
‐ I know this sounds weird,
but can I give you a hug?

25:18.435 --> 25:20.187
‐ Obviously no.

25:20.187 --> 25:22.523
The only reason you would do that
is for some mean prank.

25:22.523 --> 25:24.483
You'd probably record it
and upload it.

25:25.901 --> 25:28.570
Bonus points for seeking
active consent first, though.

25:30.197 --> 25:32.866
‐ Thank you.
Almost as good as a hug.

25:33.283 --> 25:35.827
It isn't possible to explain
how much I've missed that.

25:37.204 --> 25:39.998
‐ Missed what?
You saw me in homeroom earlier today.

25:40.916 --> 25:43.627
I didn't see you looking like this,
though.

25:44.044 --> 25:45.587
‐ Yeah, it's a costume.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.298
I was auditioning for, um...

25:49.049 --> 25:50.968
"Pirates of Penance."

25:50.968 --> 25:52.636
GERT:
That says "Penzance."

25:52.636 --> 25:56.098
That scar is just so
remarkably real.

25:56.098 --> 25:58.308
‐ Uh... thanks.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.102
Now, you two dipshits
leave her alone.

26:00.102 --> 26:02.437
‐ Why do you care all of a sudden?
‐ Yeah. You know what?

26:02.437 --> 26:04.690
I'm... I'm curious about that too.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.317
‐ Well, I mean, she suffers from anxiety,
which is a real thing,

26:07.317 --> 26:08.986
so when you guys bully her like that‐‐

26:08.986 --> 26:10.946
‐ What? Wait, hang on.
How do you know that?

26:11.446 --> 26:13.907
‐ I mean... it's obvious.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.743
‐ Obvious? What?
How is it obvious?

26:16.743 --> 26:18.662
‐ That's Wilder. I gotta go.
‐ What...?

26:18.662 --> 26:20.330

<i>hack the planet ♪</i>

26:20.330 --> 26:23.292

26:28.881 --> 26:29.923
‐ I got him!

26:31.550 --> 26:34.219
‐ Wilder! My God, you're late.
The bus is waiting.

26:34.219 --> 26:36.722
‐ Bus‐‐?
‐ It's a field trip.

26:36.722 --> 26:38.557
Ethical Hacking class, man?
‐ That's today?

26:38.557 --> 26:40.809
‐ Yeah, it's today.
‐ Who's that in my jacket?

26:40.809 --> 26:42.102
‐ You know, whatever.
Screw the time limit.

26:42.102 --> 26:43.478
We might not get another chance.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.355
‐ It's leaving.
‐ Alex, stay here, out of sight.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.232
Everyone else, let's not mess this up.

26:50.360 --> 26:51.653
Stop! Stop!

26:54.364 --> 26:57.743
‐ Mr. Stein. Hey, is there a problem?
‐ Yeah, we're looking for someone.

26:57.743 --> 26:58.869
He shouldn't be here.

26:58.869 --> 27:01.830
‐ Well, I've taken roll,
and the only people who are on this bus

27:01.830 --> 27:03.582
that shouldn't be are all of you.

27:03.999 --> 27:05.209
‐ There he is.

27:05.417 --> 27:08.295
‐ Hey, come on.
No one needs to get hurt.

27:08.295 --> 27:09.838
Just come with us, we'll work it out.

27:09.838 --> 27:13.008
‐ Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
I thought I was gonna miss...

27:16.637 --> 27:17.888
‐ Oh, what the hell?

27:23.268 --> 27:24.770
[energy pulsing]

27:24.770 --> 27:27.022
‐ I would say no weapons
on school grounds.

27:27.022 --> 27:28.148
But what is that?

27:28.857 --> 27:30.359
‐ Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
‐ Alex, no!

27:30.359 --> 27:32.569
‐ I'm Alex. Who is that?
‐ It's you from the future.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.321
‐ I got contacts?
STUDENT: Oh, please don't kill me.

27:34.321 --> 27:36.782
I can't die before Hillary is elected!

27:36.782 --> 27:38.492
‐ Have you told them?
‐ No, please don't.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.327
‐ The truth?
‐ About the election?

27:40.327 --> 27:43.205
‐ About who he is.
Who you all are in the future.

27:43.205 --> 27:45.290
‐ Alex, you need to stop right now.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.501
If you say anything else,
you could ruin everything.

27:47.501 --> 27:49.086
All their lives could be totally ruined.

27:49.086 --> 27:50.796
‐ He's the villain, not me!

27:50.796 --> 27:52.548
Ask him about the scar.
CHASE: No!

27:52.548 --> 27:53.841
[power blasts]

27:57.052 --> 27:59.680
‐ He's a lot heavier than he looks.
‐ Yeah.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.641
‐ Given our history with PRIDE,
I find the mind wipe spell immoral,

28:02.641 --> 28:05.227
but, you know,
desperate times and all that.

28:05.227 --> 28:08.480
‐ Take future Alex, get him to the gym.
Nobody will be there.

28:09.273 --> 28:10.816
[bus door opens and closes]

28:10.816 --> 28:12.526
[bus starts]

28:13.402 --> 28:16.446
‐ Okay, we're on our way.
Ethical Hacking 102!

28:16.446 --> 28:18.073
Whooo!
[cheering]

28:19.950 --> 28:21.410
[sighs]

28:21.410 --> 28:22.744
‐ What happened?

28:22.744 --> 28:24.955
‐ I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.208
This is literally anyone's
worst nightmare,

28:28.208 --> 28:31.628
to look into the future and see
that they turned out like you.

28:31.628 --> 28:33.088
‐ Come on.

28:34.047 --> 28:36.633
We both know what happened
in that jail cell.

28:36.925 --> 28:38.260
[scoffs] What we did.

28:39.094 --> 28:41.221
‐ I was manipulated, tortured...

28:41.221 --> 28:42.514
‐ You killed your mom.

28:42.514 --> 28:44.057
‐ That wasn't my mom!

28:46.226 --> 28:48.312
‐ Well, you didn't know that at the time.

28:49.938 --> 28:52.357
You wanna know how you got to where I am?

28:53.233 --> 28:55.277
I embraced my true nature.

28:55.819 --> 28:57.821
‐ And what's that, a cold‐blooded killer?

29:00.616 --> 29:05.370
‐ It's someone who will do
what no one else will in order to win.

29:05.913 --> 29:08.957
[door opens]
CHASE: Doesn't seem like a win to me.

29:10.918 --> 29:14.546
We tracked you and we stopped you
from committing several murders.

29:14.546 --> 29:16.590
That seems like a win to us.

29:16.590 --> 29:20.052
Now we take you back
and we bring you to justice.

29:20.052 --> 29:21.678
‐ For something I didn't actually do?

29:22.971 --> 29:24.765
Tell me, Chase,
what evidence will you use?

29:24.765 --> 29:25.933
What testimony?

29:26.308 --> 29:28.852
The only people that will remember this
are these people,

29:28.852 --> 29:31.146
and they all turn out rotten anyway,
you know that.

29:31.146 --> 29:34.316
‐ Maybe, because we know this,
we won't become those people.

29:34.316 --> 29:36.818
‐ Yeah. We have the future knowledge
that you talked about,

29:36.818 --> 29:38.654
we can avoid becoming... this.

29:38.654 --> 29:40.948
‐ Yeah, or maybe one of you
uses it to their advantage

29:40.948 --> 29:42.449
to escalate things in their favor.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.867
NICO:
This is getting too complicated.

29:43.867 --> 29:46.620
Which brings me, again,
to the fastest way out of here.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.497
You, exiled to Hawaii.

29:48.497 --> 29:51.416
‐ Or the Star Wars hotel.
‐ Yeah, fine. Your choice.

29:51.416 --> 29:54.711
‐ Take the hotel.
‐ Nico, no, this isn't right.

29:54.711 --> 29:56.547
Punishing him for something
that he hasn't done?

29:56.547 --> 29:59.508
‐ He's not gonna stop unless we stop him.
‐ I think I need to stop this.

29:59.508 --> 30:00.968
Alex, can I talk to you for a second?

30:00.968 --> 30:02.761
‐ Yeah, I'm more than happy
to take a break.

30:06.014 --> 30:07.599
‐ You're powerless without this.

30:07.599 --> 30:11.019
‐ And you love that, don't you?
Being in control.

30:11.019 --> 30:14.022
That's what you've always wanted.
That's why you left.

30:14.022 --> 30:15.774
‐ What do you know about why I left?

30:16.233 --> 30:19.152
‐ That's why I need you to jump back.
For your own sake.

30:19.152 --> 30:20.612
You being in close contact with him?

30:20.612 --> 30:22.865
And then Nico's ready to take
things into her own hands.

30:22.865 --> 30:24.700
I mean, as nice as
that Star Wars hotel sounds...

30:24.700 --> 30:25.909
‐ I get it, I get it.

30:27.160 --> 30:30.038
Listen.
Now that I know about him,

30:30.038 --> 30:32.666
I'm gonna do everything in my power
not to become him.

30:33.375 --> 30:37.087
And I hope that... in the future
when we meet again,

30:37.087 --> 30:39.923
that we're friends. For good.

30:40.591 --> 30:41.800
‐ I hope so too.

30:45.429 --> 30:46.471
[beeps]

30:49.308 --> 30:50.350
‐ I'm a hugger.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.645
‐ Oh, yeah, I forgot that.

30:55.564 --> 30:56.481
[sighs]

30:58.901 --> 31:01.069
‐ See ya.
‐ I hope so.

31:02.404 --> 31:03.447
[beeps]

31:03.822 --> 31:05.282
‐ Leaving wasn't some power trip.

31:05.282 --> 31:07.576
It was the only way
that I could survive.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.078
Amy died.

31:10.078 --> 31:11.872
My dad died. Gert died.

31:13.081 --> 31:15.542
You were trapped in a nightmare
that seems to have messed you up for life.

31:15.542 --> 31:18.003
And the whole time,
I had the power to save everyone.

31:18.003 --> 31:19.755
But I didn't know how to use it.

31:20.631 --> 31:23.800
‐ You could have at least said goodbye.
‐ I didn't want you to stop me.

31:24.635 --> 31:25.761
‐ I wouldn't have.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.639
‐ I didn't want to stop myself.

31:30.182 --> 31:33.644
And I would've stayed with you
and I would've been miserable

31:33.644 --> 31:35.270
for the rest of my life.

31:36.063 --> 31:38.565
‐ So you're saying that life with me
would have been miserable?

31:39.274 --> 31:41.443
You never stopped for
a moment to even think

31:41.443 --> 31:42.861
that maybe we could figure it out?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.697
‐ [energy pulsing]
‐ But I did figure it out.

31:48.575 --> 31:53.664
And now I'm back and I'm capable of doing
what I have to do to keep us all safe.

31:53.664 --> 31:55.999
CHASE:
You won't need to, I hope.

31:55.999 --> 31:59.086
‐ Where did the older...
or younger me go?

31:59.086 --> 32:01.672
CHASE: He went home.
Like the rest of you are about to.

32:02.464 --> 32:03.882
Your mission is over.

32:03.882 --> 32:05.300
I still have something left to do,

32:05.300 --> 32:07.261
but this is where
we go our separate ways.

32:07.719 --> 32:09.596
‐ What do you have to do that we don't?

32:10.097 --> 32:11.723
‐ I'm going to save Gert.

32:12.641 --> 32:16.687
That was always the plan, my entire
purpose behind building the time machine.

32:17.563 --> 32:20.566
And after seeing her here, now,

32:21.942 --> 32:23.861
I can't turn back until it's done.

32:24.987 --> 32:26.864
‐ But you could get killed trying.

32:26.864 --> 32:28.866
We all know what happened
that night with Morgan.

32:28.866 --> 32:31.159
‐ That's a risk I'm willing to take.
‐ I wanna help.

32:32.870 --> 32:34.329
‐ Molly, no...

32:34.663 --> 32:37.916
‐ She's... No, I don't care.
She's my sister, I have to.

32:37.916 --> 32:41.211
‐ Molly, no. If things go wrong‐‐
ALEX: Forget about if things go wrong.

32:41.211 --> 32:42.963
If they go right,
you'll all be committing suicide.

32:42.963 --> 32:44.256
KAROLINA:
What are you talking about?

32:45.132 --> 32:48.218
‐ The lives you have right now...
they'll all be erased.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.470
Everything that happened,
it took place after Gert's death,

32:50.470 --> 32:52.389
maybe even <i>because</i> of Gert's death.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.351
If you change that,
you change everything.

32:57.394 --> 32:58.520
CHASE:
He's right.

32:59.062 --> 33:03.150
But there remains the possibility that
you'll make the exact same choices again.

33:03.150 --> 33:07.070
Only this time, Gert will be there
to share it with you.

33:08.238 --> 33:11.241
That's the vision that's kept me
going this whole time.

33:12.034 --> 33:15.162
‐ I think the way we feel about each other
will stay the same.

33:15.454 --> 33:17.289
‐ And we'll be stronger for it.

33:19.249 --> 33:20.501
‐ Are we ready?

33:22.127 --> 33:24.046
‐ You guys really wanna do this?

33:28.884 --> 33:30.719
Let's go save Gert.

33:30.719 --> 33:31.970
[watch beeping]

33:37.601 --> 33:40.771
STACEY:
I'm doing the best I can considering...

33:40.771 --> 33:42.147
‐ Whoa.
We're right in the middle of it.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.273
‐ No, Molly!
‐ Oh, my God!

33:43.273 --> 33:45.692
DALE: Uh, well, I'm sorry.
I was just trying...

33:46.568 --> 33:47.569
My bad.

33:47.569 --> 33:50.739
‐ Oh, my God, that's not getting
any easier, is it?

33:51.490 --> 33:53.575
‐ I still have nightmares
about this night.

33:53.575 --> 33:55.661
‐ Morgan's on her way.
‐ We barely won.

33:55.661 --> 33:57.704
‐ Exactly.
And that's why my plan is simple.

33:57.704 --> 34:00.332
Since we defeated her,
we can't disrupt any of what we did.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.417
We just need to pull Gert out
so she doesn't get killed.

34:02.417 --> 34:04.419
‐ Okay, but who's gonna close the circle?

34:04.419 --> 34:06.171
‐ I will.
‐ Not a chance.

34:06.171 --> 34:07.506
Morgan will just kill you.
I'm the strongest.

34:07.506 --> 34:08.590
KAROLINA:
But not invincible.

34:08.590 --> 34:09.925
I have the power to take her on.
It should be me.

34:09.925 --> 34:11.802
‐ But your light power
is no match for magic.

34:11.802 --> 34:15.347
It's me. Magic against magic.
‐ She almost broke you last time.

34:15.347 --> 34:17.432
‐ I'm stronger now.
‐ All I have to do is complete the circle.

34:17.432 --> 34:20.269
Nico, just shield me with a spell.
That way, Morgan's gonna be distracted‐‐

34:20.269 --> 34:21.854
STACEY: ...blenders found
in this house can be.

34:21.854 --> 34:24.189
DALE: Well, of course, we're going
to thoroughly deep‐clean the blender.

34:24.189 --> 34:26.608
‐ No!
‐ If we go after him,
we'll reveal ourselves.

34:26.608 --> 34:29.319
STACEY: Hey, Alex, we're gonna
go check on your dad if you want.

34:29.319 --> 34:31.154
ALEX: I'm good, thanks.
STACEY: Guess not.

34:31.154 --> 34:34.032
DALE: He look different to you?
‐ Mm‐hmm. That nice jacket.

34:34.032 --> 34:36.785
‐ [sighs] Maybe it wasn't a good idea
to bring evil future Alex along with us.

34:36.785 --> 34:37.828
‐ It was our only option.

34:37.828 --> 34:39.955
I didn't have enough jumps
to take him back and then still get here.

34:39.955 --> 34:41.874
You two, upstairs.
Molly, come with me.

34:42.499 --> 34:44.501
NICO:
<i>How do we hold off the dark army?</i>

34:44.501 --> 34:47.504
TINA: I can try a spell, but once I begin,
I will need to maintain it.

34:49.298 --> 34:50.424
You'll be on your own.

34:52.092 --> 34:53.343

Is this one of Morgan's tricks?

It's time travel.

Okay.

Something that's more important
than Morgan or the Staff.

those you love is to leave them.

37:45.265 --> 37:46.808
That's what love is...

That's what happens
when you go out there, it's just...

40:46.572 --> 40:49.241
We've all had to live without Gert Yorkes.

40:49.867 --> 40:51.535
That's not a life worth living.

If we can change the world
for the better, we should.

40:55.998 --> 40:57.332
You taught me that.

It would have been much easier for us all.

expected as much.

something as important as this to you.
