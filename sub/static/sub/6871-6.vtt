00:00.937 --> 00:02.220
<i>[Lana] So, that bag is clothes.</i>

00:02.305 --> 00:04.438
<i>That bag is diapers.
The cooler is breast milk,</i>

00:04.507 --> 00:07.275
- which obviously needs to go in the...
- Where do you buy breast milk?

00:07.343 --> 00:09.310
[sighs]
You don't, Archer. You...

00:09.379 --> 00:11.312
[laughs]
Oh, my god, will you relax?

00:11.381 --> 00:13.347
Here. Have a cold... Wow.

00:13.416 --> 00:16.184
- So no beer?
- Why would I bring beer?

00:16.251 --> 00:18.186
Because you don't want
me drinking liquor?

00:18.254 --> 00:20.154
I don't want you drinking anything!

00:20.223 --> 00:22.423
- What, that's all for her?
- I'll find a sitter.

00:22.492 --> 00:25.159
Lana, relax. I won't
drink while you're gone.

00:25.228 --> 00:28.696
- I take this very seriously.
- Well, or at least Woodhouse does.

00:28.765 --> 00:31.432
- Yeah, and if he was here...
- Wait. What? Where is he?

00:31.501 --> 00:34.468
- [whispers] Rehab.
- Oh, seriously?

00:34.537 --> 00:37.371
I know. At his age, it's like,
why even bother?

00:37.440 --> 00:38.573
- Well?
- I'm kidding.

00:38.641 --> 00:40.575
It's his annual three days off.

00:40.643 --> 00:43.511
It's normally two, but I let
him roll over one from last year.

00:43.580 --> 00:46.314
Your largesse knows no bounds.

00:46.382 --> 00:48.349
- Well, it's not paid.
- Ugh!

00:48.418 --> 00:50.284
Have you at least
baby-proofed this place?

00:50.353 --> 00:52.286
I don't think a baby can hurt anything.

00:52.355 --> 00:55.289
No, not... Ugh! I mean,
like firearms, for instance.

00:55.358 --> 00:58.693
- Are they stored securely?
- [rattles] Yes.

00:58.761 --> 01:02.080
- I'll find a sitter.
- Lana, go. A.J.'s in good hands.

01:02.081 --> 01:06.400
I know what I'm doing.
I've read ten Baby-sitters Club books.

01:06.469 --> 01:08.536
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm totally a Kristy,

01:08.605 --> 01:11.739
- with maybe, like, a dash of Claudia.
- Because I won't have my phone.

01:11.808 --> 01:14.542
- So when you realize you can't handle it...
- I won't.

01:14.611 --> 01:16.410
But when you do... please shut up...

01:16.479 --> 01:18.412
this is the main number
at the zen center.

01:18.481 --> 01:22.831
- And a staff member will come and find me.
- In your stupid... What is it, a wigwam?

01:22.857 --> 01:25.397
- It's a yurt.
- Wow. Even stupider.

01:25.413 --> 01:27.300
- Archer, I'm serious.
- Me too.

01:27.378 --> 01:30.358
Paying to spend 24
hours sweating in a yurt

01:30.426 --> 01:32.526
is literally the dumbest
thing you've ever done.

01:32.595 --> 01:35.663
- Oh, I can think of a few more.
- You're right.

01:35.732 --> 01:38.532
Maybe this will help you shed
some of your negative energy.

01:38.601 --> 01:41.469
- My... ?
- Have fun. Say hi to your spirit animal.

01:41.537 --> 01:44.605
<i>Ugh! Okay.
I'll see you tomorrow night.</i>

01:44.674 --> 01:46.707
<i>[singsong voice]
But I bet you call before then!</i>

01:46.776 --> 01:48.843
[scoffs] I bet I won't.

01:48.912 --> 01:50.178
[muffled muttering]

01:50.430 --> 01:53.464
[gulps, coughs]
Holy shit, I gotta wash that down.

01:53.533 --> 01:55.500
See that, A.J.? That was
a teachable moment [cooing]

01:55.568 --> 01:58.937
about a little thing called
confidence. And contrary to

01:58.938 --> 02:02.306
what you may have heard, you
can never have too much of it.

02:02.375 --> 02:04.342
Or bourbon.
Where's the bourbon?

02:04.410 --> 02:06.677
Okay, I gotta have some
irish, or at least some scotch,

02:06.746 --> 02:11.449
or blended, or...
Jesus Christ, Woodhouse, stock the bar!

02:11.518 --> 02:15.753
Okay, here we go. So we have...
Ugh, tequila and coffee liqueur.

02:15.822 --> 02:20.625
All right. So we can make...
I guess this will be a... Black Mexican?

02:20.693 --> 02:23.528
[fussing]
What? No, that's not racist.

02:23.596 --> 02:27.132
That's what it is. If you added milk,
it would be a white Mexican,

02:27.133 --> 02:28.733
but all we have is breast milk...

02:28.802 --> 02:32.603
Eww, which would make
it a Rusty krieger.

02:32.672 --> 02:36.841
[slurps] Oh!
Oh, god. Wow. That is mierda.

02:36.910 --> 02:39.844
And also between us, okay?
Because your mom likes to worry, A.J.,

02:39.913 --> 02:43.414
but she doesn't need to,
because when you're with me, kid,

02:43.483 --> 02:45.616
you're as safe as a bug in a...
[door thuds open]

02:45.685 --> 02:49.487
- Archer! Help!
- Please help! He's been shot! [groaning]

02:49.556 --> 02:52.557
[A.J. crying]
Oh, good.

02:52.625 --> 02:54.625
For a second, I thought you were Lana.

[A.J. Crying]

03:43.378 --> 03:47.109
- You're the one who's bleeding to death.
- Yeah. From my ears. So shut up!

03:47.144 --> 03:51.117
[Archer] Everybody shut up,
because, spoiler alert, this is a baby.

03:51.186 --> 03:53.219
And why do you have a baby?

03:53.288 --> 03:55.188
Well, Slater.
When a mommy and a daddy

03:55.257 --> 03:57.490
- love each other very much...
- In your apartment!

03:57.559 --> 04:02.329
- Yeah. Or a motel or a porta-john, or...
- Are you trying to piss me off?

04:02.397 --> 04:05.198
- [chuckling] Not really.
- Well, you are, so...

04:05.267 --> 04:07.367
Why do you keep your
first aid kit in the bar?

04:07.436 --> 04:10.470
Because that's where over
80% of home accidents happen.

04:10.539 --> 04:13.340
- Wow. Really?
- They happen in the bathroom!

04:13.408 --> 04:17.277
Not in my home. Speaking of which,
why are you in it, and who is he?

04:17.346 --> 04:21.581
- Sterling Archer, this is Farooq Ashkani.
- Yeah. Hi.

04:21.649 --> 04:23.383
- Black Mexican?
- What?

04:23.452 --> 04:26.186
Uh, hey, dick, I happen to be Pakistani.

04:26.254 --> 04:28.555
[speaking Urdu]

04:28.623 --> 04:30.290
I was offering you a drink,

04:30.359 --> 04:33.226
but all I have is tequila
and coffee liqueur.

04:33.295 --> 04:35.261
Sorry.
I thought you were being racist.

04:35.330 --> 04:39.599
No. If anything, you were, if you
think black or Mexican is an insult.

04:39.668 --> 04:44.704
- My child is actually multiracial, so...
- Hang on. Go back. You speak Urdu?

04:44.773 --> 04:47.507
Huh? Oh. No. No, no.
Just that one phrase.

04:47.576 --> 04:50.310
The only phrase you know in Urdu is,

04:50.379 --> 04:52.579
"no, shit, you
goat-raping pig-devil"?

04:52.647 --> 04:55.482
What? 
I thought it mean, "I'm sorry."

04:55.550 --> 04:58.284
Huh. Probably why that
night in a Karachi whorehouse

04:58.353 --> 05:00.620
suddenly went from
pretty bad to much worse.

05:00.689 --> 05:02.455
I'm gonna stop you there.

05:02.524 --> 05:04.667
Somebody should. I mean, this is a baby.

05:04.668 --> 05:06.246
Because time's a bit of a factor.

05:06.291 --> 05:10.023
Until yesterday, Farooq was a
cyberspy for Pakistani intelligence.

05:10.058 --> 05:11.896
But now he wants
to come over to our side.

05:12.925 --> 05:13.733
Are we not on the same side?

05:13.802 --> 05:15.535
- Eh...
- Eh...

05:15.604 --> 05:17.704
Anyway, I was walking
him into a CIA safe house,

05:17.773 --> 05:20.373
but a bunch of his former
colleagues were waiting for us.

05:20.442 --> 05:22.342
I had to shoot our way out of there.

05:22.411 --> 05:23.743
But how did they know
where the... [gasps]

05:23.812 --> 05:27.514
Oh, my god, 
could the CIA have a leak?

05:27.582 --> 05:30.000
That's what I said!

05:30.185 --> 05:34.487
Anyway, until I find the leak and
plug it, I need you to babysit him.

05:34.556 --> 05:37.791
And I object to the term "babysit,"
because clearly I am not a baby.

05:37.859 --> 05:39.592
And I'm already babysitting

05:39.661 --> 05:42.562
what clearly is an actual
baby, so... [cooing]

05:42.631 --> 05:46.733
- She sure is. Can I hold her?
- Uh, yeah. Okay.

05:46.802 --> 05:50.637
- But, you know, be careful.
- I got her. There we go.

05:50.705 --> 05:52.472
- Archer, come on.
- No.

05:52.541 --> 05:53.740
- 24 hours.
- No!

05:53.809 --> 05:55.642
- And a hundred grand.
- Yes!

05:55.710 --> 05:57.811
Okay, good. I'll call you
after I deal with the leak,

05:57.879 --> 05:59.746
then you'll bring him
to the new safe house.

05:59.815 --> 06:03.683
- And payment will be...
- By wire transfer. Is that a problem?

06:03.752 --> 06:06.670
No. I just didn't know
if I should bring my sack

06:06.671 --> 06:08.825
- with the big dollar sign on it.
- Just bring him.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.557
And I need to borrow a shirt.

06:10.625 --> 06:14.461
- Farooq?
- Um...

06:14.529 --> 06:16.563
Why do you... [scoffs]
Never mind.

06:16.631 --> 06:18.498
There's a logic to all of it.

06:18.567 --> 06:20.633
<i>Aw, you're absolutely insane.</i>

06:20.702 --> 06:22.769
<i>[chuckling] 
Crazy son of... [muttering]</i>

06:22.838 --> 06:24.671
[door closes] Is he gone?

06:24.739 --> 06:27.607
- Yeah, he's...
- Because he's kind of a dick, right?

06:27.676 --> 06:30.127
- Right.
- And what's the deal with that safe house?

06:30.205 --> 06:32.777
Am I right? Come on.
They should call it a...

06:32.810 --> 06:34.914
Misnomer house.
[slurps]

06:34.983 --> 06:36.916
But this place is safe, though, right?

06:36.985 --> 06:38.918
- Yeah, I mean...
- Yeah, I mean, it's the penthouse.

06:38.987 --> 06:40.854
And I assume that's the only door, so...

06:40.922 --> 06:42.555
Well, except for the terrace, but...

06:42.624 --> 06:44.591
<i>Yeah, so maybe we should lock that?</i>

06:44.659 --> 06:45.825
[fussing]
Hey. Shh.

06:45.894 --> 06:47.694
Sorry.
I was just kind of freaking out, man.

06:47.762 --> 06:50.730
- I just saw a guy get shot.
- Well, if you get her started again,

06:50.799 --> 06:53.066
- you're gonna see you get shot, so...
- Yeah, okay.

06:53.134 --> 06:56.736
- So you have guns here, right?
- Yes. I literally have tons of them.

06:56.805 --> 06:59.906
- Yeah, but...
- Hang on. Not literally, but a lot.

06:59.975 --> 07:02.876
Yeah. Okay. 
But on you, I mean, like...

07:02.944 --> 07:04.878
Are you strapped? 
[laughing]

07:04.946 --> 07:08.081
Am I strapped? 
No, homie, I'm not.

07:08.149 --> 07:11.751
Okay, so you don't have a gun on you,
is what I'm saying.

07:11.820 --> 07:14.754
And "no" is what I'm saying.

07:14.823 --> 07:16.856
- Okay, good.
- Wh...

07:16.925 --> 07:19.004
That's just gonna make
this next part a lot easier.

07:19.235 --> 07:21.182
Well, for me.

07:23.811 --> 07:25.811
[laughing]

07:25.880 --> 07:28.881
Oh, my god. Okay.
Good stuff.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.917
- You had me going there for a second.
- [laughs] I'm sorry?

07:31.986 --> 07:36.588
I can't believe Lana set this up.
Just so I'd call and ask for help.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.825
And you got Slater in on it?
With the fake blood?

07:39.894 --> 07:41.827
Oh, man. She is pathetic.

07:41.896 --> 07:42.961
[silenced shot] Aah!
[crying]

07:43.030 --> 07:45.697
What the shit? You shot me!

07:45.766 --> 07:48.699
- I wanted your full attention.
- Well, you nailed it, asshole!

07:48.810 --> 07:51.403
Jesus Christ! 
Did Lana pay you extra too shoot me?

07:51.467 --> 07:53.473
Okay, I don't know this Lana, but...

07:53.539 --> 07:55.140
- I'm sorry?
- Yeah. Me too.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.776
She sounds like a real practical joker.

07:57.845 --> 08:01.747
But I assure you, Mr. Archer,
this is all very real.

08:01.816 --> 08:04.116
Hey, hey, now, listen to me, all right?

08:04.185 --> 08:05.951
Listen.
I don't know what's going on,

08:06.020 --> 08:09.688
- but you're gonna hand me the baby.
- No, Mr. Archer, I am not.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.757
Not until you take me
to your headquarters

08:11.826 --> 08:13.826
so I can access the mainframe computer.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.961
Yeah, I heard you, but
I'm not going anywhere

08:16.030 --> 08:18.764
- until you put it up there.
- Fine. Whatever.

08:18.833 --> 08:20.699
[tires screeching]

08:26.794 --> 08:30.629
Wow!
You drive like a gaping dickhole.

08:31.966 --> 08:33.899
[grunts]

08:33.967 --> 08:37.035
[muzak plays]
So I guess there's no CIA leak.

08:37.104 --> 08:39.889
Nope. My follow team created
a diversion so that Slater

08:39.890 --> 08:42.674
would bring me to you, so
that you would bring me here.

08:42.743 --> 08:45.644
- Just don't hurt her.
- Well, I hope it won't come to that.

08:45.713 --> 08:48.681
- You really, really should.
- Just make sure there are no surpris...

08:48.749 --> 08:50.716
<i>[Pam] God damn it!</i>

08:50.785 --> 08:52.651
- What the...
- It's Friday night.

08:52.720 --> 08:55.821
- Why the hell are people still here?
- I don't know. I guess it's...

08:55.890 --> 08:57.990
Jeezy petes! An inside straight?

08:58.059 --> 09:00.393
[all grumbling]

09:00.611 --> 09:02.811
Got three on the hip,
I need four for the weekend.

09:02.880 --> 09:06.582
- I'm going to Hotlanta.
- Have fun, I hope you get hate-crimed.

09:06.651 --> 09:07.616
Hey, whoa!

09:07.685 --> 09:08.751
- Goddamn, woman.
- Seriously.

09:08.819 --> 09:10.853
I'll hate-crime your ass right here.

09:10.922 --> 09:12.855
- [Gillette] You know what?
- Guys, come on.

09:12.924 --> 09:15.658
Can't we have one poker
night without a hate crime?

09:15.726 --> 09:18.894
Okay, A: the thing last
month wasn't a hate crime...

09:18.963 --> 09:22.898
Because I will straight-flush your
brains out the back of your skull!

09:22.967 --> 09:26.001
- It was just a regular crime.
- And obviously now I put my gun

09:26.070 --> 09:28.003
in the time-lock safe
until the game's over.

09:28.072 --> 09:30.606
And so basically, the
only thing keeping you

09:30.675 --> 09:33.642
from murdering each other is
a lack of access to firearms.

09:33.711 --> 09:35.911
- Works for Canada.
- Nothing works for Canada.

09:35.980 --> 09:37.012
<i>[Archer] Hey guys...</i>

09:37.081 --> 09:39.048
[greetings]

09:39.116 --> 09:40.749
Is... Are you playing strip poker?

09:40.818 --> 09:42.151
<i>[together] No.</i>

09:42.219 --> 09:44.954
- It just gets hot as balls in here.
- Literally.

09:45.022 --> 09:47.890
- Okay, well...
- Hang on! Yeah, literally.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.793
- Right, I just came by because, uh...
- Aha!

09:50.861 --> 09:53.028
Because you need help with the
baby and you can't call Lana,

09:53.097 --> 09:56.832
- so you came to ask one of us for help.
- For your information, Cyril,

09:56.901 --> 09:59.685
I don't need help with
A.J. because I, uh...

10:00.071 --> 10:03.595
Hired a manny.
Hey, I'm... Manny.

10:03.908 --> 10:05.292
[general mumbles of greeting]

10:05.414 --> 10:08.045
- Black Mexican?
- No, thank you, I probably shouldn't.

10:08.092 --> 10:11.037
- Shouldn't what?
- Uh, swarm across the Rio Grande?

10:11.160 --> 10:13.816
- From Pakistan?
- Where's Woodhouse?

10:13.884 --> 10:17.773
My guess, Avenue D.
Anyhoo, we just, um, gotta grab...

10:17.972 --> 10:22.641
Some baby stuff.
So, we're gonna go do that. Manny?

10:22.710 --> 10:25.544
Good luck with your... hate-cards?

10:25.663 --> 10:27.763
<i>Pff, go back to Canada, Guy Lafleur.</i>

10:27.832 --> 10:30.700
Okay, ante up, ya
goat-raping pig devils!

10:30.768 --> 10:33.002
- Nothing wild but the dealer.
- Hang on a sec.

10:33.071 --> 10:35.805
Did Archer seem a little, like...
scared to you guys?

10:35.873 --> 10:36.939
[dismissing]
What?

10:37.008 --> 10:40.746
Ya know, now that you mention it,
he did actually seem a little nervous.

10:40.812 --> 10:41.977
Hmm...
[accepting]

10:42.046 --> 10:43.879
I bet he's just on the C.D.L.

10:43.948 --> 10:46.849
- The what?
- Canadian down-low.

10:46.918 --> 10:48.984
Please, like you all
wouldn't bang Alan Thicke

10:49.053 --> 10:52.822
- if you had the chance.
- I think we should go check it out.

10:52.890 --> 10:56.609
- Well, if we're not gonna play poker!
- I thought this was ouija.

10:56.678 --> 10:59.776
So, those guys... Kinda dicks, right?

10:59.777 --> 11:01.325
- Right?
- Totally.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.683
Okay, now enter
the command sequence string.

11:03.751 --> 11:07.386
<i>Okay good, now once you've...
entered that...</i>

11:07.455 --> 11:10.790
wow, still working on it.
You also type like a gaping dickhole.

11:10.859 --> 11:12.525
Sorry, I don't wanna mess up.

11:12.594 --> 11:14.627
Man, you are nothing like your file.

11:14.696 --> 11:16.762
All these stories about
what a badass you are,

11:16.831 --> 11:19.499
but I gotta tell ya,
Farooq's not seeing it.

11:19.567 --> 11:22.835
Well, in those stories, I'm probably
not changing poopy diapers, so...

11:22.904 --> 11:24.604
So do you seriously not even care

11:24.672 --> 11:27.473
- what I'm doing with your mainframe?
- I honestly don't.

11:27.542 --> 11:28.674
Okay, I'm going to tell you anyway.

11:28.743 --> 11:30.877
I'm using it to backdoor
my state-of-the-art

11:30.945 --> 11:34.572
spyware into the CIA network,
so Pakistani intelligence

11:34.649 --> 11:36.908
will know everything
they do in real time.

11:36.976 --> 11:39.644
And... 
why are you telling me this?

11:39.712 --> 11:42.780
- I'm ... Wait, what?
- I mean, now I'm just gonna tell the CIA,

11:42.849 --> 11:47.018
- and they'll find the spyware.
- That was only one of many, many

11:47.086 --> 11:49.720
- possible things I could be doing.
- Okay.

11:49.789 --> 11:52.657
No, no, and the very
fact that I told you

11:52.725 --> 11:54.992
that's what I'm doing, I mean that was

11:55.061 --> 11:57.728
- clearly misdirection, right?
- Okay.

11:57.797 --> 11:59.597
Plus, I doubt you'll
be talking very much

11:59.666 --> 12:00.865
after I shoot you in the face.

12:00.934 --> 12:02.733
Take it easy, I...
[small gasp]

12:02.802 --> 12:04.769
Shit! I don't have a will!

12:04.837 --> 12:06.637
- I'm a notary!
- Wha...?

12:06.706 --> 12:08.973
What the shit, Manny?

12:09.042 --> 12:10.975
[struggling, baby crying]

12:11.044 --> 12:12.944
Pam! Baby!

12:13.012 --> 12:16.847
[Pam screaming]
What the heck's going on in...

12:16.916 --> 12:19.888
[growls]

12:20.016 --> 12:21.378
[growls]

12:22.129 --> 12:25.843
- Well, ya don't see that everyday.
- I didn't even see it today...

12:26.309 --> 12:28.643
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[crashes]

12:29.036 --> 12:30.538
<i>So, here's the thing, Farooq.</i>

12:30.639 --> 12:32.096
I don't know about any stories,

12:32.165 --> 12:35.099
but whatever badass shit
that you heard I did,

12:35.168 --> 12:37.835
you really need some context, because

12:37.904 --> 12:40.671
pretty much my whole life,
pretty much right up until

12:40.740 --> 12:44.041
this minute, my default
setting has been "half-ass."

12:44.110 --> 12:48.112
But that was before I had a child,
a child you threatened to harm.

12:48.181 --> 12:51.782
A child, I just realized,
who's probably on her way up

12:51.851 --> 12:55.748
to the roof so Aunt Pam
can swat at biplanes.

12:55.906 --> 12:58.373
Wait, what the hell am I doing?

12:58.441 --> 13:00.675
The roof's the first place they'll look.

13:00.744 --> 13:03.711
So imagine, as I literally
beat you to death...

13:03.780 --> 13:08.383
Hang on. Yeah, literally,
that a giant hand has turned my dial

13:08.451 --> 13:10.752
from "half-ass"
to "quadruple-ass."

13:10.820 --> 13:15.657
- Wow. That is a lot of ass.
- Yeah, basically eight times the ass.

13:15.725 --> 13:18.426
Can I just say one thing,
before we get into all

13:18.495 --> 13:20.728
- the beating to death?
- What? [gun unsheathing, being cocked]

13:20.797 --> 13:22.397
I still have a gun?

13:24.634 --> 13:26.632
Oh, right.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.875
<i>[Gillette] Well?
What's going on in there? </i>

13:29.876 --> 13:33.578
Okay, so...
that lesbian au pair has a gun.

13:33.647 --> 13:35.613
<i>I think she's robbing Mr. Archer.</i>

13:35.682 --> 13:36.748
- [together] Wait, what?
- What au pair?

13:36.817 --> 13:39.784
- The black Mexican.
- Oh for... So what should we do?

13:39.853 --> 13:42.754
Nothing!
Until we consult the ouija.

13:42.823 --> 13:44.689
God I love poker night.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.859
So, before you shoot me,
can I just say one thing?

13:47.928 --> 13:50.495
What?

13:50.564 --> 13:53.631
[screams]

13:53.700 --> 13:56.768
What the shit, Cyril?
[gasping]

13:56.837 --> 13:58.603
Really?
[gunshots]

13:58.672 --> 14:00.672
Take cover! C'mon, Cyril.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.640
[panicking]

14:02.709 --> 14:04.375
There's other desks.

14:04.444 --> 14:05.810
- This one's good.
- Ow. Damn it!

14:05.879 --> 14:08.680
This is exactly how Brett died.

14:08.748 --> 14:10.882
[sigh] 
Man, I wish he was still with us.

14:10.951 --> 14:13.852
[chuckling] He could soak
up some of these bullets.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.688
God, finally. 
Okay, that's eight rounds,

14:16.756 --> 14:18.523
including the one in
my shoulder, so he's...

14:18.592 --> 14:20.458
<i>- [Farooq] Reloading!
- God dammit.</i>

14:20.527 --> 14:21.693
Oh! Ray, gun.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.629
- It's in a time-lock safe.
- What? Why?

14:24.698 --> 14:25.797
Because Cheryl.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.599
<i>[Farooq] I'm calling for backup!</i>

14:27.667 --> 14:29.667
<i>[speaking Urdu]</i>

14:29.736 --> 14:32.937
- What'd he say?
- Well, my Urdu isn't as strong as I thought.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.940
[speaking Urdu]

14:36.009 --> 14:38.943
Meh. But I'm gonna assume
he just called for backup.

14:39.012 --> 14:40.712
So we gotta get to the armory.

14:40.780 --> 14:43.615
- It's empty.
- It's... What do you mean, it's empty?

14:43.683 --> 14:46.751
- When we got shut down, that guy...
- Kevin. Kyle?

14:46.820 --> 14:48.720
Keith? Kenny? Kieran.

14:48.788 --> 14:51.656
- Rodney?
- Rodney! Why was I thinking Kev...

14:51.725 --> 14:53.124
He stole everything!

14:53.193 --> 14:55.894
He set himself up in Europe
as some kind of arms dealer.

14:55.962 --> 14:58.663
<i>Gentlemen, I'm afraid
you mistake my hospitality</i>

14:58.715 --> 15:00.899
for weakness.
The price is the price.

15:00.967 --> 15:06.737
If you wish to negotiate, you
may do so with my associates.

15:06.806 --> 15:07.939
[evil laugh]

15:08.008 --> 15:09.841
And apparently he's doing quite well.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.943
<i>[gunshots, yelping]
[Farooq] Reloading!</i>

15:12.012 --> 15:14.746
[annoyed sigh] Remind me, if this
asshole doesn't kill all of you,

15:14.814 --> 15:17.849
- to do it for him.
- [chuckling] Uh, no.

15:17.918 --> 15:21.819
- And take that ridiculous thing off.
- Make me.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.956
- Ow, stop it, cut it out, stop, ow!
- [gasp] Wait a minute.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.691
- Ow!
- Gimme that.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.760
Okay, on my signal,
I'm gonna draw his fire.

15:28.828 --> 15:31.401
You idiots make make a run
for it, find Pam and A.J.,

15:31.402 --> 15:33.504
and get them to safety
before the rest of these

15:33.536 --> 15:34.697
jerk-dicks get here.

15:34.703 --> 15:36.835
- What about Cheryl?
- Who cares?

15:36.836 --> 15:39.835
No, I'm genuinely asking.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.967
So while we're getting A.J. out of here,
what're you gonna be doing?

15:43.036 --> 15:45.970
Krieger, the HVAC ducts are still
chock full of nerve gas, right?

15:46.039 --> 15:47.639
- Wait, what?
- Yeah, but...

15:47.707 --> 15:50.875
But shut up, just get A.J. outta here,
I'll take care of the rest.

15:50.944 --> 15:52.877
- Archer, that's...
- Pretty heroic, I know.

15:52.946 --> 15:55.613
- I was gonna say overkill, but...
- What're you, on their side?

15:55.682 --> 15:57.882
That asshole threatened to hurt A.J.!

15:57.951 --> 16:01.052
Although now that I think about it,
this whole thing is totally her fault.

16:01.121 --> 16:03.922
What? As far as field
operations are concerned,

16:03.990 --> 16:08.548
she's a huge liability!
Now shut up and wait for my signal.

16:08.728 --> 16:11.830
<i>[Farooq] Reloading. I should
probably stop saying that out loud.</i>

16:11.898 --> 16:15.099
- Should we just go now?
- I mean, yeah you should have,

16:15.168 --> 16:17.969
but it's probably too late now, so...

16:18.038 --> 16:21.673
Now!
[speaking Urdu]

16:21.741 --> 16:22.841
Quit saying that!

16:22.909 --> 16:25.109
[yelling]

16:25.178 --> 16:26.811
We should've gone then, I bet.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.714
<i>[speaking Urdu]</i>

16:31.251 --> 16:34.819
[chuckling] Where do
you think you're going?

16:34.888 --> 16:36.120
Must...

16:36.189 --> 16:38.957
protect... baby.

16:39.025 --> 16:40.058
[slow clapping]

16:40.126 --> 16:42.060
What the...?

16:42.128 --> 16:44.229
Not bad.
I'm gonna give you a seven.

16:44.297 --> 16:46.931
- Wait, what?
- Me, or him?

16:47.000 --> 16:50.001
- No him, Slater said you were great.
- Aww, he's sweet.

16:50.070 --> 16:52.071
You, I took off a point because Pam

16:52.072 --> 16:54.072
was feeding A.J. Vienna sausages.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.875
Idiot!
She's not on solid food yet.

16:56.943 --> 16:59.657
- They weren't solid.
- The fact that you were

16:59.672 --> 17:02.180
pre-chewing them and spitting
them into her mouth...

17:02.249 --> 17:04.015
What the hell is going on?
[baby crying]

17:04.084 --> 17:06.017
Shhhh.
What is wrong with you?

17:06.086 --> 17:10.054
- Well for starters, I got shot. Twice.
- Where did you get a real gun?

17:10.123 --> 17:12.223
My cousin. The one you gave
me looked like, so fake,

17:12.291 --> 17:15.260
and I thought a real one would help
me get into the character better.

17:15.328 --> 17:17.829
Oh, give it a rest, James Lipton.

17:17.897 --> 17:20.098
- He's an actor?!
- Well, mostly improv, but...

17:20.165 --> 17:22.233
You set this whole thing up?
You had me shot?

17:22.301 --> 17:25.936
- You had Slater shot?
- No, the CIA guys did his make-up.

17:26.006 --> 17:27.070
Looked pretty real though, huh?

17:27.140 --> 17:29.874
- So cool.
- Were you assholes in on this?

17:29.943 --> 17:31.075
[denials]

17:31.244 --> 17:33.344
Oh, please, you can't
tell them anything.

17:33.413 --> 17:36.080
Why... would you do this?!

17:36.149 --> 17:40.084
I wanted to see if I could trust you
to take care of A.J. by yourself.

17:40.153 --> 17:43.187
Oh!
Yeah, let's talk about trust!

17:43.256 --> 17:45.768
Oh, let's talk about drinking
a gallon of black Mexicans

17:45.850 --> 17:48.781
before driving around in a car
with your infant daughter!

17:48.829 --> 17:50.973
- Good point
- I was at gunpoint!

17:51.008 --> 17:52.527
- Also good.
- [Lana] Well...

17:52.575 --> 17:54.432
you still lied when you said
you weren't gonna drink.

17:54.501 --> 17:56.200
You knew I was lying.

17:56.269 --> 17:59.370
That doesn't ex...
Wait, that's your excuse?

17:59.439 --> 18:03.274
Yes! Lana.
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:03.343 --> 18:07.078
I am in fairly desperate
need of medical attention.

18:07.147 --> 18:10.214
[baby cries]
All your fault!

18:10.283 --> 18:12.543
<i>God damn it!
Why are you going up?</i>

18:12.936 --> 18:16.237
All right, I'd call this...
a qualified success.

18:16.306 --> 18:21.075
- Yeah, I really feel like I nailed it.
- So... you do improv, huh?

18:21.144 --> 18:24.279
Yeah, at Dream the improovable dream,
down on Twenty-third and Lex.

18:24.347 --> 18:27.182
You guys gotta come down,
ya know, maybe take a class,

18:27.250 --> 18:29.984
it's good for confidence, or just,
at least come out to a show...

18:30.053 --> 18:31.386
Here's some flyers.

18:31.454 --> 18:34.122
Our upcoming shows are on
there, plus there's a coupon

18:34.191 --> 18:37.025
for a free drink if you're a lady, so...

18:37.093 --> 18:39.493
Wait, is it not the Imprahv-able dream?

18:41.598 --> 18:44.333
Huh.
That makes way more sense.
