Don't push me.

02:01.480 --> 02:04.120
Stick with him.
Don't let him get too far ahead.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.360
- Daddy, I'm tired. Can't we stop?
- Yeah, honey.

02:07.480 --> 02:11.800
There isn't any people on the side streets.
And they're darker.

02:11.920 --> 02:15.240
- That's just what they'd want, honey.
- Daddy, I'm scared.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.760
So am I, honey. Hang on.
Be light. Be a feather.

02:19.880 --> 02:22.400
- What's going on?
- Excuse me!

02:22.520 --> 02:25.120
"(man #1 )" He's seen us.
Whatever you do, no eye contact.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.600
- He can make you do what he wants.
- "(man #2)" Got it.

02:29.960 --> 02:32.640
"(man #1 )" See him?
He just got lost in that crowd there.

02:32.760 --> 02:35.920
"(man #2)" That's him, over on the right.
Right there on the right.

02:36.040 --> 02:39.320
<i>(man #3)</i>
Maybe I can cut him off at the corner.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.600
Let's get him.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.560
Daddy, they're coming.

02:53.560 --> 02:55.640
Taxi. Taxi.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.000
Drive.

03:04.480 --> 03:06.680
- Stop!
- Stop the car. Hey, cabbie.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.320
Don't pay any attention to them.
Just drive.

03:12.960 --> 03:17.280
Come on, let's get back to the car.
We can chase them down. Let's move it.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.520
- Hey, mister, where are we going?
- The airport.

03:21.640 --> 03:26.360
Wait, wait, I can't go to the airport.
It's too far.

03:26.480 --> 03:28.440
Look...

03:32.200 --> 03:37.120
I'm gonna give you a $500 bill. I want you
to take my daughter and I to the airport.

03:37.240 --> 03:39.360
Sure. OK, mister.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.360
<i>(distorted voices)</i>

03:44.880 --> 03:48.720
- "(Dad)" Drive.
- I ain't turning down no $500.

04:00.960 --> 04:06.480
We are going to give each one of you ten
young ladies and gentlemen an injection.

04:06.600 --> 04:10.240
Five of these injections will be water.

04:10.360 --> 04:15.040
Five of them will be water mixed with
a tiny amount of a chemical compound

04:15.160 --> 04:19.480
which we call... "lot six".

04:20.959 --> 04:23.440
The exact nature
of this compound is classified

04:23.560 --> 04:27.920
but it is essentially
a hypnotic mild hallucinogenic.

04:29.440 --> 04:33.320
We employ the double-blind method
of administering the compound,

04:33.440 --> 04:39.360
which is to say that neither you nor we
know who has received the clear dose

04:39.480 --> 04:41.520
and who has not.

04:41.640 --> 04:43.880
Until later, that is.

04:44.000 --> 04:49.280
You will be under close supervision
for 48 hours after the experiment.

04:49.400 --> 04:52.480
Are there any questions?

04:52.600 --> 04:57.040
Dr Wanless, is this experiment
being done by The Shop?

04:58.080 --> 05:00.080
No.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.320
Absolutely not.

05:02.440 --> 05:05.320
- Yes?
- When do I get my money?

05:05.440 --> 05:08.160
- "(all)" Right on, man.
- That is important.

05:08.280 --> 05:12.960
Well, immediately after the experiment,
along with all the other students.

05:13.080 --> 05:15.040
I'm broke too.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.960
So, if we may begin
the injections now, please.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.520
Andy McGee.

05:25.520 --> 05:30.400
I'm Vicky Tomlinson. I'm a little nervous
about this, Andy McGee.

05:30.520 --> 05:35.280
- What if I go on a bad trip?
- We'll probably just get distilled water.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.840
"(Wanless)" Feel any pain?

05:51.960 --> 05:55.800
<i>(woman)</i>
I feel a pressure. It's a bad pressure.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.120
"(Wanless)" It will pass.

06:01.720 --> 06:06.320
- How are you feeling?
- When do we start to shrink?

06:06.440 --> 06:09.400
You believe you're going to shrink?

06:10.640 --> 06:16.800
Sh-ri-nk...

06:18.960 --> 06:20.640
You'll be fine.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.680
We'll be fine.

06:33.240 --> 06:35.200
<i>(disturbed voices)</i>

06:37.640 --> 06:40.240
"(woman)" I can't feel my hands.

06:40.360 --> 06:46.040
- Thank you. What a nice compliment.
- I didn't say anything.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.800
You did.

06:49.360 --> 06:53.520
- What'd I say?
- You said my hair is beautiful.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.760
Like copper set on fire.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.840
Yeah.

06:59.640 --> 07:03.160
But I didn't say that. I just thought it.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.920
<i>(Andy thinks) I love you.</i>
<i>I've always loved you.</i>

07:11.040 --> 07:14.400
<i>- I've known you for a thousand years.</i>
<i>- (Vicky thinks) That long?</i>

07:14.520 --> 07:17.280
<i>Yes, I've loved you too.</i>

07:20.000 --> 07:21.880
<i>(commotion)</i>

07:28.560 --> 07:30.320
<i>(screaming)</i>

07:48.480 --> 07:50.600
Hey, buddy, airport.

07:50.720 --> 07:53.920
- You OK?
- "(groans)"

07:54.040 --> 07:57.920
I got a headache. Wake up, babydoll.

07:58.040 --> 08:01.120
We're here. Come on.

08:01.240 --> 08:04.080
Where are we?

08:04.200 --> 08:06.720
Hanover, sweetheart. Airport.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.760
- Try the airport.
- Roger.

08:22.240 --> 08:25.920
Suppose we catch up with him.
Do you wanna face him down?

08:26.040 --> 08:30.640
What do you call this thing he's got?
How he pushes people.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.559
The Shop figures
he may be running down by now.

08:33.679 --> 08:36.600
He's overdone it before
and wound up in bed.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.760
It's doing something to his brain.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.760
Like what?

08:40.880 --> 08:45.240
Giving himself
pinprick haemorrhages, maybe?

08:45.360 --> 08:48.640
- It could kill him.
- Good, let's hope.

08:56.800 --> 09:00.520
We don't have any more money
and we don't have anything left to sell.

09:00.640 --> 09:02.640
I can't stay here.

09:02.760 --> 09:06.520
It's not right. It's not right to steal.

09:06.640 --> 09:11.680
Honey, I know, but it's not right
for them to keep coming after us, either.

09:11.800 --> 09:15.280
Now, I explained that to you, Charlie,
at least I tried.

09:15.400 --> 09:21.080
- About the big bad and the little bad?
- That's right. Lesser and greater evil.

09:21.200 --> 09:26.720
- Big bad is what I did to Mommy?
- Oh, darling, please.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.600
Don't. Don't, baby.

09:29.720 --> 09:32.640
I made Mommy scream.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.720
Shh...

09:44.320 --> 09:46.480
Does your head still hurt?

09:51.640 --> 09:53.600
Poor Daddy.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.440
Gotta keep a lookout.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.840
OK.

10:07.320 --> 10:10.120
"(man)" I don't know
what you're doing here.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.960
I don't want to have anything to do with
you. I told you not to follow me here.

10:14.080 --> 10:19.120
Besides, it's not my fault.
I'm not responsible.

10:19.240 --> 10:23.200
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
I'm not the only guy you've been seeing.

10:23.320 --> 10:28.200
I'm not ready to get married,
so why don't you just get outta here?

10:28.320 --> 10:31.760
- Why don't you just stop bugging me?
- "(Andy)" Come on, Charlie.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.680
"(woman)" You told me you loved me.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.720
You told me if anything
happened you'd take care of me.

11:01.120 --> 11:05.080
This ain't got nothing to do with me.
We've been through this 100 times.

11:05.200 --> 11:10.040
I'm not responsible.
Look, I told you not to follow me here.

11:11.640 --> 11:15.680
"(woman)" But I can't do it on my own.
I don't know where to go.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.320
- I don't have any money.
- I'm not the only guy you've been with.

11:19.440 --> 11:22.360
"(woman)" That's not true.

11:22.480 --> 11:26.000
I swear to God you're the only one.
I've never slept with anyone else.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.760
"(man)" That's not
what my buddy Al told me...

11:41.080 --> 11:43.280
I didn't mean it, Daddy.

11:48.920 --> 11:50.880
- Ow!
- Hey, hey!

11:55.000 --> 11:58.840
- All right, buddy, come outta there.
- Mind waiting till I put my feet out?

11:58.960 --> 12:04.560
I was coming with you and I saw him and
before I could stop it, it just happened.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.640
- I didn't like him and it just got away.
- It's OK, honey.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.480
- But I set him on fire.
- Charlie.

12:09.600 --> 12:13.200
- I didn't mean it, Daddy.
- Charlie, stop it.

12:13.320 --> 12:18.080
I want you to listen to me.
You said it got away from you and it did.

12:18.200 --> 12:23.160
But not like before.
It just got away a little bit.

12:23.280 --> 12:28.240
Charlie, you might've set
that man's face on fire or his hair.

12:28.360 --> 12:31.520
Now, it always goes out
at somebody you don't like.

12:31.640 --> 12:36.120
- But you didn't really hurt that guy.
- Not like I hurt Mommy in the kitchen.

12:36.240 --> 12:40.880
Baby. Baby, you've got
to stop thinking about that.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.760
It wasn't you that really hurt Mommy.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.240
They killed her.

12:56.840 --> 12:59.400
That's right. That's right.

13:01.400 --> 13:02.680
Now...

13:02.800 --> 13:04.800
We've got to go on.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.640
Single file. Just like the Indians.

13:09.760 --> 13:13.760
And keep as far over
to the side of the road as you can, OK?

13:28.160 --> 13:32.120
"(man)" I seen them both.
This guy looked kinda sick, or something.

13:35.640 --> 13:38.120
- Are you OK?
- "(Andy sighs)"

13:38.640 --> 13:43.160
- So far, so good, baby. You getting tired?
- Nope.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.520
Daddy, I feel those bad men
from The Shop around again.

13:51.680 --> 13:52.640
OK. Come on.

13:59.680 --> 14:01.520
OK, sweetheart, come on.

14:06.200 --> 14:07.800
Head up Route 70.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.880
Oh, Daddy.

14:13.760 --> 14:17.160
"- (screams)" Daddy, get up.
<i>- (truck horn)</i>

14:17.280 --> 14:19.360
Daddy, wake up.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.480
<i>(she screams)</i>

14:29.560 --> 14:31.680
Daddy? Daddy?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.760
Are you all right?

14:43.760 --> 14:47.000
- I thought you were dead.
- Are you kidding?

14:47.120 --> 14:51.880
Think I'd do that to you?
You're all I've got in this world.

14:54.160 --> 14:57.600
But I'm happy about that
cos I'm crazy about you.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.120
I'm crazy about you too, Daddy.

15:06.480 --> 15:10.040
Come on. We gotta find a place to sleep.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.040
We can afford it now.

15:33.880 --> 15:38.760
- I burned him.
- Rest, sweetheart.

15:38.880 --> 15:42.120
You didn't hurt him. You controlled it.

15:42.240 --> 15:44.200
- "(groans)"
- Shh...

15:50.440 --> 15:51.760
<i>(Andy) OK, Charlie.</i>

15:51.880 --> 15:54.760
Now, let it out. Easy does it.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.800
Let it go.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.160
Attagirl.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.000
Attagirl. OK.

16:03.120 --> 16:05.000
Now pull it back.

16:09.080 --> 16:12.120
Pull it back, Charlie.
Pull it back, Charlie.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.200
Good Lord.

16:19.680 --> 16:25.440
Now, you've got to learn to control that.
You gotta try real hard. OK?

16:25.560 --> 16:29.400
- I couldn't help it.
- Tomorrow. She's tired.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.680
Time for bed.
You can try again at breakfast.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.720
- I wanna do that again.
- No, tomorrow.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.840
I'm not tired. I wanna do it again.

16:40.960 --> 16:43.800
- I said no.
- Again. Now!

16:44.800 --> 16:47.280
<i>(screaming)</i>

16:50.360 --> 16:53.320
I'm sorry, Mommy. I didn't mean it.

16:53.440 --> 16:55.680
Well, you did it. You hurt your mother.

16:55.800 --> 17:00.320
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- It's all right. Mommy's all right.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.000
Charlie, you have got to control this thing

17:03.120 --> 17:06.040
because it's a bad thing,
you understand me? A bad thing.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.160
- Leave her alone. It's not her fault.
- "(phone rings)"

17:10.280 --> 17:12.640
- Hello?
- Sorry.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.280
<i>(he sighs)</i>

17:16.520 --> 17:19.599
- Hung up again?
- Whoever it is.

17:19.720 --> 17:25.800
We know who they are and they wanna
make sure we're staying right here.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.480
<i>(Andy) Vicky? Charlie?</i>

17:34.280 --> 17:36.120
I'm home.

Sweetheart?

17:56.040 --> 17:58.000
Vicky!

18:15.600 --> 18:17.920
Oh...

18:18.040 --> 18:19.680
Oh, no.

18:22.720 --> 18:26.080
Oh, no. Please, please, God.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.280
Please don't be here.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.200
Please don't...

18:31.160 --> 18:34.320
Oh, no! Please, no, no!

18:35.080 --> 18:39.160
Oh, no! Babe! Oh, what did they do?

18:39.280 --> 18:43.120
What did they do?
They put this in your mouth.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.360
<i>(weeps)</i>

18:51.280 --> 18:53.960
Where's Charlie? Charlie!

18:55.400 --> 18:57.360

18:59.880 --> 19:02.200
Charlie!

19:02.320 --> 19:04.280
Charlie!

Charlie!

19:14.680 --> 19:17.000
Charlie!

19:18.480 --> 19:21.360
Joan,
by any chance is my daughter with you?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.520
<i>- (Charlie screams)</i>
<i>- (man) Hold her!</i>

19:42.600 --> 19:45.080
OK, that's far enough.

19:50.360 --> 19:52.320
Drop the gun.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.520
Drop it.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.080
Bring her to me.

20:17.320 --> 20:18.680
You're blind.

20:20.680 --> 20:22.640
"(yelling)" My eyes!

20:25.320 --> 20:30.240
You too, you son of a bitch.
You killed my wife. You're blind.

20:33.120 --> 20:35.080
"(screaming)" My eyes!

20:35.200 --> 20:38.200
Oh, my God! Leon!

20:39.560 --> 20:42.360
- Andy!
- "(man)" My eyes!

20:42.480 --> 20:44.880
Joan.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.400
Go back inside the house.
You won't remember any of this.

20:51.440 --> 20:53.400
- Leon!
- Oh, God!

20:55.160 --> 20:57.560
My eyes! Son of a bitch!

20:57.680 --> 20:59.360
Can't see!

21:14.040 --> 21:19.120
- Wake up, baby. It's time to move on.
- Morning.

21:40.560 --> 21:43.520
- Elaine. Morning, Josie.
- Good morning.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.800
Jamieson called in. No word yet
on the McGees. He'll ring later.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.760
Put him right through when he does.

21:48.880 --> 21:52.080
And Rainbird is in your office.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.240
- When did he get back?
- This morning.

22:00.280 --> 22:03.040
- Morning, Kenny.
- Morning, sir.

22:25.200 --> 22:28.240
Welcome back, Rainbird.

22:28.360 --> 22:31.160
- How was Venice?
- "(he chuckles)"

22:31.280 --> 22:33.120
Sinking.

22:33.240 --> 22:39.440
- Is our problem there solved?
- Our problem there is solved.

22:40.520 --> 22:44.320
- Dr Wanless is here.
- Christ, there goes a beautiful day.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.160
Ah, the good doctor.
What do you want, Joe?

22:53.840 --> 22:58.360
- Have you caught them yet?
- We'll catch them. What do you want?

22:58.480 --> 23:03.000
What do I always want?
Why do I stay alive?

23:03.120 --> 23:06.000
To try to persuade you
to sanction them both,

23:06.120 --> 23:10.280
expunge them,
wipe them from the face of the earth.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.760
Andrew McGee and his daughter

23:13.880 --> 23:17.120
constitute the greatest threat
that's confronted this nation.

23:17.240 --> 23:20.200
- That's a lot of crap.
- You feel guilt!

23:20.320 --> 23:24.520
Eight out of ten of our young volunteers
have died, committed suicide.

23:24.640 --> 23:27.760
You want to justify your participation.

23:27.880 --> 23:31.480
You were all in favour of it at the time.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.560
I know.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.760
I didn't realise.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.400
None of us did.

23:44.160 --> 23:50.480
Lot Six was nothing more
than a synthetic copy of pituitary extract.

23:50.600 --> 23:56.000
- A powerful painkiller hallucinogen.
- For God's sake, Joe, don't start again.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.040
You see...

24:08.760 --> 24:10.720
You see...

24:12.640 --> 24:17.320
This pituitary extract is responsible
for the occasional flashes of psi ability

24:17.440 --> 24:20.280
which most human beings demonstrate
from time to time.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.760
Precognition, telekinesis,
mental domination,

24:24.880 --> 24:29.160
the kind of domination that this
experiment brought out in Andrew McGee.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.320
What is the point, Doctor?

24:31.440 --> 24:36.040
Since this child was born, her father has
tried to inhibit her use of those powers.

24:36.160 --> 24:42.040
But what if his control
had weakened now?

24:43.360 --> 24:46.960
Why would he lose control now
after all these years?

24:47.080 --> 24:49.160
Ask yourself this question.

24:49.280 --> 24:54.600
How exhausting must it have been
for Victoria and Andrew McGee

24:54.720 --> 24:57.000
when this child was an infant?

24:57.120 --> 25:00.000
The bottle is late. The baby cries.

25:00.120 --> 25:04.320
And at that moment, one of her stuffed
toys right there in the crib beside her

25:04.440 --> 25:06.880
bursts into smoky flame.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.440
Joe, she's just a little girl.
She can light fires, yes,

25:10.560 --> 25:14.320
but you're making her sound
like Armageddon.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.960
That's what it might well be.

25:17.080 --> 25:21.560
Suppose lighting fires
is merely the tip of the iceberg.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.920
I don't know what you're talking about.

25:24.040 --> 25:26.680
I am talking about a talent
that is directly linked

25:26.800 --> 25:30.640
to this child's pituitary gland,
undeveloped pituitary gland.

25:30.760 --> 25:35.480
What happens when she becomes
adolescent and that sleeping gland wakes

25:35.600 --> 25:40.400
and becomes, for 20 months, the most
powerful force in the human body?

25:40.520 --> 25:46.480
Suppose we have a child here
who some day is capable

25:46.600 --> 25:50.720
of creating a nuclear explosion
simply by the power of her will.

25:51.840 --> 25:56.040
- That's insane.
- Is it? Is it?

25:56.160 --> 25:59.360
Then allow me to progress
from insanity to utter lunacy.

25:59.480 --> 26:03.880
Suppose there is a little girl out there
somewhere today, this morning,

26:04.000 --> 26:08.840
who has within her,
lying dormant at present,

26:10.040 --> 26:13.640
the power some day
to crack the very planet in two,

26:13.760 --> 26:16.840
like a china plate in a shooting gallery.

26:25.320 --> 26:29.080
What if we could train this little girl?
And others as well.

26:29.200 --> 26:31.160
Could we have more powerful weapons?

26:31.280 --> 26:33.640
No! No more experiments.

26:33.760 --> 26:37.000
Don't force me to go above your head
because I will if I have to.

26:37.120 --> 26:40.800
I'll have you and this entire establishment
eliminated.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.480
An excitable man.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.760
Where are we gonna go now?

27:04.880 --> 27:07.760
We have to find some place
to stay for a while.

27:07.880 --> 27:11.760
I don't think anybody'll believe us
but if we send letters to the newspapers

27:11.880 --> 27:15.760
maybe The Shop will have to lay off.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.560
We could go to Granther's.

27:19.560 --> 27:23.200
- What made you think of that?
- I don't know.

27:23.320 --> 27:27.840
Cos I was thinking about your grandfather
not five minutes ago.

27:36.720 --> 27:39.720
We'll check the motel.
I want you to work the road further down.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.800
Well... That's a pretty little miss.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.360
- What's your name, missy?
- Roberta.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.040
Well, Bobby, where are you headed for?

27:54.160 --> 27:58.440
We're headed for Tennessee. Knoxville.
My wife's there visiting her sister.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.560
- Ran into a little problem.
- Did she?

28:00.680 --> 28:05.080
Yeah, labour. This one's got
a new baby brother. 1 .40 this morning.

28:05.200 --> 28:09.720
- His name's Andy. Isn't that a nice name?
- I think it's a corker.

28:09.840 --> 28:14.320
Mine's Irv Manders. Hop in.
I'll get you ten miles closer to Knoxville.

28:26.360 --> 28:28.320
<i>(car horn)</i>

28:38.120 --> 28:40.920
- Hey, Al, it's them.
- You're joking?

28:41.040 --> 28:43.760
- No, damn it, it's them.
- Did you get the number?

28:43.880 --> 28:47.440
- Did you see which way they went?
- I didn't even see them check out.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.640
Hey, we got them.

29:01.120 --> 29:04.720
Why don't you two come home,
take lunch with me and the wife?

29:04.840 --> 29:08.920
- We couldn't...
- Daddy, I'm starving.

29:09.040 --> 29:13.120
- Are you sure you got enough?
- Always, and I'm glad to have you.

29:13.240 --> 29:17.320
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure, Bobby.

29:17.440 --> 29:20.680
It'll be my wife's too
when she gets a look at you.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.800
Always wanted a little girl herself.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.480
But I guess that wasn't to be.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.520
"(lrv)" Got a song for you.

29:33.640 --> 29:35.760
Oh, there was an old hen
She had a wooden leg

29:35.880 --> 29:38.000
Finest old hen that ever laid an egg

29:38.120 --> 29:42.880
She laid her eggs all over the farm
Another little drink won't do us any harm

29:43.000 --> 29:45.320
<i>(laughter)</i>

30:00.440 --> 30:03.520
- Who'd you bring home, Irv?
- This little girl is Roberta.

30:03.640 --> 30:05.720
This young fella here's her daddy.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.880
I didn't catch his name yet
so I don't know if we're related.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.440
- Frank Burton, ma'am.
- Hello, I'm Norma Manders.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.360
- Hi.
- Hello.

30:20.680 --> 30:23.800
Your husband invited us back for lunch.
Hope you don't mind.

30:23.920 --> 30:26.120
Why, sure. Come on in.

30:27.240 --> 30:30.200
Come on, Bobby. Feedbag.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.280
<i>(belches)</i>

31:00.880 --> 31:04.000
More room out than there is in, button.

31:04.120 --> 31:09.160
If I eat any more, I think I'll split.
That's what my mom used to...

31:09.680 --> 31:13.840
I mean that's what she always says.

31:17.320 --> 31:20.280
Norma, why don't you and Bobby go out
and feed those chickens?

31:20.400 --> 31:23.920
I wanna have a little talk with Frank here.

31:24.640 --> 31:27.360
- Would you like that?
- Do they peck?

31:27.480 --> 31:30.080
Only what they eat, honey.

31:30.200 --> 31:32.680
- Come on.
- OK. Goody.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.520
Want a beer, Frank?

31:40.640 --> 31:46.960
- It isn't Frank, but I guess you know that.
- I guess I did.

31:47.080 --> 31:49.960
- What is your name?
- Andy.

31:50.080 --> 31:54.280
- Well, Andy, what about that beer?
- I guess I could use it.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.360
You got it.

32:01.560 --> 32:04.920
- There you go.
- Thank you.

32:05.040 --> 32:10.200
- Here, let me help.
- No, that's all right. I know this routine.

32:16.240 --> 32:20.440
- Cops after you, Andy?
- Sort of cops, yeah.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.520
You snatch that little girl from her mother?

32:24.640 --> 32:29.680
No, she's my daughter,
but her mother didn't set the cops on us.

32:29.800 --> 32:32.720
Her mother's been dead for a year.

32:32.840 --> 32:36.680
Don't appear like you got her
against her will.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.040
What do they want you for,
anyway, Andy?

32:41.160 --> 32:43.840
- Who are they?
- Government agents.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.560
- FBI?
- No, The Shop.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.880
The Shop?

32:50.000 --> 32:55.520
Yeah, it's really the Department
of Scientific Intelligence. DSI.

32:56.520 --> 33:00.640
My daughter, Charlene and I, Charlie,

33:00.760 --> 33:05.960
we were part of an experiment
that happened a long time ago.

33:06.080 --> 33:08.360
Tell me about it.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.720
OK, now go ahead.

33:11.840 --> 33:14.760
Thank you. Do you eat these chickens?

33:14.880 --> 33:18.840
If I can catch one, I might eat one.
We eat the eggs.

33:19.480 --> 33:22.120
They want to examine her and study her.

33:22.240 --> 33:25.560
So they can figure out just what makes
her able to do what she can do.

33:25.680 --> 33:28.920
I think they want to use her
to reactivate the Lot Six programme.

33:30.400 --> 33:34.120
Andy, I think you ought to call the police.
Turn yourself in.

33:34.240 --> 33:38.600
- Yeah, I know it sounds crazy.
- As crazy as anything I've ever heard.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.840
Daddy, I fed the chic...

33:43.600 --> 33:45.960
You told.

33:46.080 --> 33:49.040
Daddy, why'd you tell?

33:49.920 --> 33:51.360
<i>(gasps)</i>

33:53.440 --> 33:56.400
They're coming. They're coming for us.

34:00.560 --> 34:04.960
They're gonna kill you, Daddy. We have
to run, we have to hide, we have to...

34:06.400 --> 34:09.960
Yes, yes, that's what they wanna do.
They wanna kill you.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.360
Kill you like they did Mommy
and take me away. I won't let it happen.

34:13.480 --> 34:17.199
Holy Jesus Christ. Did she do that?

34:19.920 --> 34:22.639
Charlie, now, watch what you're doing.

34:23.679 --> 34:26.120
Is it too late?

34:26.239 --> 34:29.480
Yes, they're coming up the dirt road now.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.040
Daddy, I'm scared.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.880
Charlie, you can stop them.

34:37.960 --> 34:42.480
If I do something bad,
will you still love me?

34:43.679 --> 34:45.800
Oh, Charlie...

34:45.920 --> 34:47.560
Of course I'll still love you.

34:47.679 --> 34:51.480
I love you more than anything
in the world, no matter what happens.

34:57.760 --> 35:02.160
I got some tall apologising to do.
There's a line of cars coming up the road.

35:02.280 --> 35:05.160
I'll stand with you if you want.
I'll get my deer gun.

35:05.280 --> 35:07.320
You don't need your gun.

35:39.320 --> 35:42.440
Hi, Andy. Hi, Charlie.

35:43.480 --> 35:47.160
- Honey, you don't have to run any more.
- Go away.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.360
Afraid I can't do that, honey.
I have my orders.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.360
No one wants to hurt you or your daddy.

35:53.480 --> 35:56.960
You liar, you're supposed to kill him
and I know it.

35:57.720 --> 36:01.080
I'd advise you do what my daughter says.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.360
You know why she's wanted.
Remember the soldier at the airport?

36:07.960 --> 36:11.160
You men are trespassing.
I want you to get off my property.

36:11.280 --> 36:13.280
We're government agents, sir.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.800
These two folks are wanted
for questioning. Nothing more.

36:16.920 --> 36:19.880
I don't care if they're wanted
for assassination.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.280
- Show me a warrant or get off my land.
- We don't need a warrant.

36:23.400 --> 36:25.840
You do unless I woke up
in Russia this morning.

36:25.960 --> 36:29.480
If you'll just get in the car,
we can discuss all this.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.640
Honest to gosh,
there's nothing going on here.

36:32.760 --> 36:37.920
- We know what's going on.
- Please, don't make me do anything.

36:50.280 --> 36:55.480
"(Andy)" Get out! Don't you understand
what she's doing? Can't you feel it?

36:55.600 --> 36:58.040
Don't be stupid.

36:58.160 --> 36:59.960
If we can only discuss this, please.

37:00.080 --> 37:02.480
- Get him!
- Watch it, Andy. Watch it.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.720
Not the girl. Not the girl.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.920
<i>(screaming)</i>

37:46.280 --> 37:50.280
She's never done anything like this
before. I don't know if she can stop.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.240
Get out. Get out.

37:54.680 --> 37:56.360
Go! Go!

37:58.680 --> 38:00.640
Help me!

38:13.400 --> 38:15.800
- Let's go!
- Don't leave me!

38:18.480 --> 38:20.520
- Charlie.
- "(screaming)"

38:34.440 --> 38:36.520
Stop it. That's enough.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.120
Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

38:39.240 --> 38:41.200
Sorry, Daddy.

38:46.760 --> 38:49.400
<i>(screaming)</i>

38:50.800 --> 38:53.360
Let's get outta here, back to The Shop.

38:53.480 --> 38:55.760
Go, go, go!

39:04.360 --> 39:06.320
Oh, my God.

39:09.800 --> 39:13.600
Andy. There's an old Willy's Jeep
out behind the barn.

39:13.720 --> 39:16.720
No, Irv, don't get involved any deeper.

39:16.840 --> 39:19.000
Those men came here
without any warrants,

39:19.120 --> 39:23.080
tried to take them off our land,
one of them shot me.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.320
What do you want me to do?
Turn them over to the secret police?

39:26.440 --> 39:30.600
They'll be getting their peckers up enough
to come back. Be a good Nazi?

39:30.720 --> 39:35.400
- I guess not.
- You don't have to do anything else.

39:35.520 --> 39:38.760
No, please, take the Jeep and get away.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.840
Just get away.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.240
Charlie.

40:20.360 --> 40:23.800
There's the lake. We're here.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.000
<i>(she giggles)</i>

41:15.240 --> 41:17.720
Come on, Charlie.

41:17.840 --> 41:20.160
We got a lot of cleaning up to do.

41:20.280 --> 41:23.920
Nobody's lived here
since your grandfather died.

41:24.040 --> 41:26.800
I hope that key's still here.

41:42.520 --> 41:45.800
Do you think they'll find us here?

41:45.920 --> 41:51.120
After what you did at the farm,
I think they're gonna stay pretty far away.

41:51.240 --> 41:53.280
If they still wanna capture us,

41:53.400 --> 41:57.640
they're gonna have to figure out
a different way to do it.

41:57.760 --> 42:00.920
Well, anyways, we've got us a new home.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.880
Let's go. Let's go.

42:06.520 --> 42:08.560
Don't it look good?

42:08.680 --> 42:12.160
Daddy, will things
ever be the same for us again?

42:12.280 --> 42:16.000
Will I be able to go to school,
and things, again?

42:16.120 --> 42:18.400
Sure you can.

42:19.520 --> 42:23.360
- After you write the letters, right?
- That's right.

42:23.480 --> 42:26.200
Tell the newspapers all about it.

42:26.320 --> 42:29.240
Then the running'll be over.

42:29.360 --> 42:33.120
We'll live normal lives,
like everybody else.

42:38.080 --> 42:41.040
- Can I be...?
- What?

42:41.160 --> 42:45.400
- Like everybody else?
- Darn tootin' you can.

42:47.920 --> 42:50.200
I wanna be.

42:52.920 --> 42:55.520
Look who's here.

43:02.320 --> 43:05.240
- How'd you feel?
- Safe.

43:08.120 --> 43:11.360
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Daddy.

43:21.360 --> 43:23.320
<i>(mutters)</i>

43:59.840 --> 44:01.560
<i>(clears throat)</i>

44:13.560 --> 44:15.640
Do you have a phone here?

44:15.760 --> 44:17.720
Right over here.

44:25.920 --> 44:29.200
<i>- They're here. They mailed some letters.</i>
- All right, good deal.

44:29.320 --> 44:33.160
Get a hold of Bates. He can be there
in an hour and keep me informed.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.200
- Mr McGee?
- And Miss McGee.

44:35.320 --> 44:38.200
- Where are they?
- The summer cottage near Bradford.

44:38.320 --> 44:41.080
- I'll bring them here.
- Oh, just like that?

44:41.200 --> 44:44.520
- You know what that little girl can do.
- I know.

44:44.640 --> 44:48.040
That's why I'll bring her here.
So you can do all your tests.

44:48.160 --> 44:53.640
On the condition that you give her to me
for disposal when you're finished with her.

44:53.760 --> 44:55.840
What?

44:55.960 --> 45:00.320
- I want her when you've finished with her.
- You are mad.

45:00.440 --> 45:04.640
How right you are.
So are you, mad as a hatter.

45:04.760 --> 45:09.080
You sit here making plans for controlling a
force that's beyond your comprehension.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.560
A force that belongs
only to the gods themselves.

45:11.680 --> 45:13.960
What the hell are you talking about?

45:14.080 --> 45:17.920
Things I'm sure
you wouldn't want the world to know.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.640
What's to stop me from
having you erased right here and now?

45:23.760 --> 45:24.720
Hmm!

45:24.840 --> 45:30.720
My word that I've already made certain
provisions that, should I disappear,

45:30.840 --> 45:33.640
The Shop will cease to exist
within six weeks.

45:33.760 --> 45:36.800
And within six months,
you will stand in front of a judge,

45:36.920 --> 45:41.920
awaiting sentence for crimes
serious enough to keep you behind bars

45:42.040 --> 45:43.720
for the rest of your life.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.920
Just... what is it you want?

45:59.040 --> 46:02.640
Your word that my involvement
with this child Charlene

46:02.760 --> 46:04.560
will not end when I bring her here.

46:04.680 --> 46:07.440
That's just the beginning.
We're going to be friends.

46:07.560 --> 46:10.360
- We haven't got her yet.
- We'll have her.

46:14.400 --> 46:16.320
All right.

46:16.440 --> 46:20.640
I guess we've got a deal,
but why do you want her?

46:20.760 --> 46:27.400
She's very beautiful. She's very young.
Yet inside her is the power of the gods.

46:27.520 --> 46:30.440
We're going to be close, she and I.

46:30.560 --> 46:34.000
Oh, yes.
Gonna be very close.

46:37.040 --> 46:42.440
Reel in some of the slack out of the line.
Real slow, come on in, a little more.

46:42.560 --> 46:46.000
OK, now give it a little tug.
Attagirl, now reel.

46:46.120 --> 46:49.120
Yes, sirree! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

46:49.240 --> 46:52.000
- A real whopper.
- Lookee here. How about that?

46:52.120 --> 46:53.560
<i>(she laughs)</i>

47:11.600 --> 47:13.560
Here he comes.

47:19.480 --> 47:22.680
Saved by the Postal Department.
Am I glad to see you?

47:22.800 --> 47:25.680
I think we got a dead battery.
Could you give us a jump?

47:25.800 --> 47:28.920
- Let's take a look at it.
- Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.

48:31.040 --> 48:32.800
Where will we go now?

48:32.920 --> 48:35.080
Offices of "The New York Times."

48:35.200 --> 48:40.480
- But you sent them a letter.
- Well, they might not have gotten it.

48:40.600 --> 48:42.880
Do you think they took them?

48:43.000 --> 48:44.960
No!

49:03.440 --> 49:06.680
- I'll get it, baby.
- "(yells)" I can do it!

49:08.440 --> 49:12.320
Baby, baby, come on, now.
It's almost over.

49:12.440 --> 49:14.400
"(crying)" It's never gonna be over.

49:14.520 --> 49:17.280
- It's not over.
- Come on.

49:17.400 --> 49:21.120
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is. Come here.

49:21.240 --> 49:23.200
<i>(she weeps)</i>

49:27.480 --> 49:29.920
- Are you ready to go?
- I guess so.

49:30.040 --> 49:33.720
Daddy, I'm never gonna start
another fire in my life.

49:33.840 --> 49:36.840
Even if they come
before we can get away.

49:36.960 --> 49:40.720
I'm never gonna hurt
another person in my life.

49:40.840 --> 49:44.920
That's OK, Charlie. I can understand that.

49:46.600 --> 49:47.840
OK.

49:47.960 --> 49:49.160
Jump.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.240
That's a big girl.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.400
OK...

50:42.120 --> 50:44.520
Charlie? Charlie! Charlie!

50:50.240 --> 50:53.040
Oh God, oh God, oh God, oh God!

50:53.160 --> 50:55.680
They shot my daughter! "(echoes)"

50:55.800 --> 50:59.760
Come on out where I can see you,
you son of a bitch.

51:01.840 --> 51:02.800
Baby.

52:01.400 --> 52:03.720
Nothing to it.

52:57.720 --> 52:58.880
Charlie!

52:59.000 --> 53:02.600
She's all right, Mr McGee. Take it easy.

53:09.160 --> 53:12.320
Where is she? I wanna see her.

53:12.440 --> 53:16.040
All in good time. First, let's talk.

53:16.160 --> 53:18.560
Let's get acquainted.

53:19.680 --> 53:21.640
Go to hell.

53:22.440 --> 53:25.400
I tell you, she's gonna be all right.

53:32.520 --> 53:34.480
No. No.

53:50.360 --> 53:53.840
- What do you want with us?
- I told you, Mr McGee.

53:53.960 --> 53:57.400
We are going to be spending
considerable time with each other

53:57.520 --> 54:00.360
and I want to introduce myself.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.800
I'm Dr Pynchot.

54:02.920 --> 54:06.920
I'm going to make sure
you're treated well here.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.680
Is this The Shop?

54:15.840 --> 54:18.200
This is The Shop.

54:55.120 --> 54:57.080
<i>(bleeping)</i>

55:01.800 --> 55:03.160
Hi, Charlene.

55:03.280 --> 55:07.160
- I'm Captain Hollister. May I come in?
- Where's my daddy?

55:10.320 --> 55:12.360
I brought you some cocoa.

55:21.040 --> 55:22.760
I don't want anything.

55:22.880 --> 55:26.040
There's nothing to be afraid of. Here.

55:27.520 --> 55:29.760
You see? Go on.

55:32.040 --> 55:34.400
Well, maybe later.

55:36.880 --> 55:40.600
I've been looking forward
to meeting you for a long time.

55:42.280 --> 55:45.920
I know you may not believe this
but I've actually begun to think of you

55:46.040 --> 55:47.800
as my own daughter.

55:47.920 --> 55:52.600
- What have you done to my father?
- He's resting and he's fine, just like you.

55:52.720 --> 55:55.080
He knows you're all right
and he sends his love

55:55.200 --> 55:57.120
and he wants you to cooperate with us.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.360
You're a liar.

55:59.480 --> 56:02.240
What kind of talk is that
from a nice little girl like you?

56:02.360 --> 56:05.280
- Go to hell!
- Oh?

56:06.240 --> 56:10.280
A very stubborn nice little girl.
That's all right, I understand.

56:10.400 --> 56:13.120
I know you're tired
and you're not sure where you are.

56:13.240 --> 56:18.320
So I just want to ease your mind, Charlie.
Do you mind if I call you Charlie?

56:20.200 --> 56:22.360
All right, Charlene.

56:22.480 --> 56:26.440
You are here because I'm very interested
in this ability that you have.

56:26.560 --> 56:28.440
Pyrokinesis.

56:28.560 --> 56:29.640
Yes.

56:29.760 --> 56:34.440
All of us here are interested in that and
we want to see how far you can take it.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.320
I'll tell you this, Charlie,

56:36.440 --> 56:40.040
you'll be doing this great country of ours
a big favour if you cooperate.

56:40.160 --> 56:46.000
I said I would never start another fire
in my life. I wanna see my father.

56:48.440 --> 56:50.560
OK.

56:50.680 --> 56:51.640
Um...

56:51.760 --> 56:54.440
Why don't you drink the cocoa
and get some sleep?

56:54.560 --> 57:00.120
If there's anything you want,
just pick up the phone and let us know.

57:00.240 --> 57:03.720
I know you'll find this
hard to believe now, Charlie, but...

57:03.840 --> 57:06.000
you and me are gonna be pals.

57:06.120 --> 57:07.560
Never.

57:08.760 --> 57:11.480
Never say never.

57:11.600 --> 57:13.560
I'll see you, Charlie.

You're not gonna do it.

Isn't that pretty?

I'll start in the bedroom.

No.

Where's Charlie?
What are you doing with her?

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.720
She's perfectly all right.
There's nothing to worry about.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:09.080
- Yeah, well, I wanna see her, goddamn it.
- Just behave yourself.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.960
Do as we ask, we'll see.

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:15.920
You bastards.

Oh, sure. Well, sure.

Good deal.

we're supposed to be doing in here?

All they told me was to come talk to you.

Yeah, I'm thirsty.

He's been on the run too long.

- Just give me time.

Rainbird's right.
He's lost it and time won't help.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.080
Increase his medication.
I'll decide what to do with him later.

- Work on the girl.
- Oh, I am.

what they want you to do?

I mean, if just by doing it,
you can get to see your old man.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.880
No, sir, I wouldn't like that.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.360
Hey...

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:23.080
Listen.

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.960
Are you scared by my face?

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:28.560
I mean,
I could wear a mask or something.

01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.960
I've seen worse.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:10.200
<i>(door rattles)</i>

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.560
Kid! Kid, please!

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.760
I can't stand the dark. Please, kid.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:20.920
Kid!

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:23.800
- I gotta get outta here. Help me.
- Use your card.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.760
All the electricity's gone. The card's
no good. Hey, let me outta here.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.080
Hey! Let me out!

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.480
- What's the matter?
- Let us out. There's people in here.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.240
- Stop it, we're OK.
- "(he weeps)"

01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.840
I mean, aren't we?

01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.240
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.160
It's just... the dark. I can't stand it.

01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:55.160
It's just like the place they put me
when I was captured.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:59.640
- Who put you?
- The Cong.

01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:03.240
- Who's the Cong?
- You mean to tell me...?

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.680
Oh, no, of course not, you're too young.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:09.400
It was the war, see. Vietnam.

01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.760
The Cong were the bad guys.
They wore black pyjamas.

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.160
In the jungle we were on patrol.
Walked into an ambush.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.160
Only about six of us got out.

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.840
We ran.

01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:25.840
Went the wrong way.

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.120
They caught me.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.360
Threw me in a hole in the ground.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:35.360
Like being buried alive.
It was always dark like this.

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:37.480
What did you eat?

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.560
They threw down rotted rice.

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.720
Sometimes I'd eat spiders.

01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.480
Live ones. Big spiders. I'd chase them
around in the dark and eat them.

01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.520
Gross.

01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.000
They turned me into an animal.

01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.600
You got it easier than me, kid,
but it all comes down to the same thing.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.000
Like a rat in the trap.

01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:03.000
You think maybe they'll get
the lights back on pretty soon?

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:06.200
Doesn't matter. We're together.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:12.920
God, kid. If some day I could help you
the way you're helping me...

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:18.080
You could.
You could get a message to my father.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:22.800
You know, what's it all about? Why do
they have you and your daddy here?

01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.440
What do they want you to do?

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:33.200
They won't make me take any more pills.

01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:36.160
No more pills, you bastard.

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.200
How are you gonna help Charlie
if you're a goddamn zombie?

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.720
Listen,
maybe I could get in to see your dad?

01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:49.840
- You could? You really think you could?
- I could change with Herbie, an orderly.

01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:54.920
I could see your dad, tell him you're OK...
Maybe not tell him, pass him a note.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.280
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Shit.

01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:02.280
Maybe you oughta light
the damn fires if you can.

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:06.640
I told you, it's like letting a wild animal
out of a cage.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.920
I promised myself I'd never do it again.

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:16.560
That men at the airport, those men at
the farm, I killed them, I burned them up.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.960
Yeah, but the way you told it,
it sounded like self-defence.

01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:22.600
Yes, but that's no excuse.

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:26.160
Also sounded like you saved
your dad's life.

01:08:26.279 --> 01:08:29.279
Look, if you do what they want you to do,

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:33.160
only as much as you want to do, it might
be the way for you to get out of here.

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:36.279
I'll help anyway I can.

01:08:36.399 --> 01:08:39.080
Oh, my! Light.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.160
Hold on here.

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:46.960
I'm sorry you got stuck with me
in here, John.

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.479
But I'm awful glad too.

01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.960
You look like you could use
a little rest, huh? Come on, let's try.

01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:59.080
Attagirl.

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:01.160
There we go.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.920
That's the girl.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:20.640
You just relax
and you'll be asleep in no time.

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:26.960
And you'll have sweet, sweet dreams.

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.319
That's the girl.

01:09:38.279 --> 01:09:41.520
- Good night, kid.
- Good night.

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.200
Daddy.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.680
Now, Charlie, you know
what you're supposed to do.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.080
I want you to go in the other room. I don't
want to have to look at you while I do this.

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:09.000
Something might happen.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.200
Look at those alphas,
she's really jacked up.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.720
Everything all set? Tape rolling?

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:43.240
- Everything all right with her?
- Yes.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:47.840
- You all set in there?
- Ready in here.

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.040
Are we ready here? Tape rolling?

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:56.160
- Rolling.
- All right. Everyone stand by.

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.240
Go ahead, Charlene.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:17.600
Wood chips. They should've given me
something harder.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.880
Something's happening in there.

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:35.360
- Temperature just jumped ten degrees.
- "(bleeping)"

01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.280
There it goes.

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:03.560
Her alpha patterns
look like the goddamn Andes.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.560
She did it. By God, she did it
and we got it all on tape.

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.320
Back off. Just back off.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.240
Back off.

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:30.320
Look at the tub.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.760
Back off.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.280
Did you see the water boil?
And the temperature?

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.520
- Jesus, did we get the audio?
- We got it.

01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:52.400
Good deal. My God, did you see
what she did? Did you see that?

01:12:52.520 --> 01:12:57.440
My God, is there anyone here that has
any doubt she didn't make that happen?

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:59.040
Not at all, Chief. None.

01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:01.600
I knew something would happen
but I had no idea.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:05.440
That tray flew and she controlled it.
Then she put her power in the tub.

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:08.440
We got all on tape
and it's good enough to stand up in court.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:12.720
Right up in the Supreme Court.
What are you looking so miserable about?

01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.440
You got her to do it by promising
she could see her father again.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.520
- She must never see him.
- We never intended to let her.

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:26.280
She'll never stop asking for it. Suppose by
some strange accident they get together.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:30.160
- Suppose they do.
- She does whatever he tells her.

01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.000
Suppose he persuades her
to destroy us all.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.720
- No chance.
- There's always a chance.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.480
He's right.
They can never see each other again.

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.080
Then you better send
somebody along after her.

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:48.200
Huh?

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:51.360
Your technician must've had
an appointment he forgot about.

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.880
He went out of here in a hell of a rush.
He also left the door open

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:58.000
and your firestarter just walked out.

01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.880
Christ.
One of you men go and get her.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.080
Go on.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.240
Sure.

01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.560
Which of you would like
to go and get the little girl?

01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:59.840
<i>- (knocking)</i>
<i>- Andy?</i>

01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:04.680
Here you go, buddy.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:08.520
Oh, good.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.560
Listen, Andy,

01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:29.920
we've determined that your power
has deteriorated since you got here.

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.640
In fact, we've had no positive results at all.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:38.400
What do you expect with all these drugs?

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.280
You expect me to do my best
when I'm stoned?

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:46.080
I did everything I could. I tried.
I did everything I could.

01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:50.000
Yes, of course I know that you have
and believe me, I appreciate it very much.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.280
In fact, I think you need a rest.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:57.480
Did you know that The Shop has a small
compound on the island of Maui, Hawaii?

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.360
How would it be if I sent you there
for the immediate future?

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:05.600
- I still get my medication?
- Oh, sure, all you need.

01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:11.080
- Well, that sounds nice.
- All right, good deal.

01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:15.360
Then I'll get things started
in that direction right away.

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:20.240
You just take it easy, kid.
We'll take care of everything.

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.480
<i>(bleeping, door closes)</i>

01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:30.160
<i>(groans)</i>

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:07.240
She's so beautiful. What's her name?

01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:11.360
"(laughs)" Actually, she's more of a boy.
His name is Necromancer.

01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.200
What does necromancer mean?

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.720
I think it means something like wizard
or sorcerer. Something like that.

01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:26.120
They said if I did what they wanted,
they'd let me see my father.

01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:30.960
How did I know they were gonna be so
damn stubborn? You have to do it again.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.880
- But when will I ever stop?
- Look, baby.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:37.720
It's like poker.

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:41.640
If you ain't dealing from strength,
you ain't dealing.

01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:46.840
Every time you light one of their fires,
make sure you get something in return.

01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:50.280
This is your old Uncle John talking,
you understand me?

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:51.760
OK.

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:55.600
What about this power of yours?
You were awful scared about it before.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.000
How'd you feel about it now?

01:17:58.120 --> 01:18:01.920
It's different now. It's a lot stronger.

01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:06.720
Yesterday, when I told it to back off, it did.

01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:10.400
It was like I let it out
in a single straight line and then...

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:14.640
- Then you pulled it back into yourself?
- Oh, no. I put it into the water.

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.040
If I pulled it back into myself,
I guess I'd burn up.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.520
When am I gonna get to see my father?

01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.960
Well, Charlie, we'll just have
to give them enough rope.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:29.160
Next time, there has to be more water.

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:46.360
Everything all set here?

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.880
Tape running? All right, stand by.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.960
We're ready when you are, Charlene.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.880
<i>(cracking)</i>

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.800
The temperature
should be -26 degrees Celsius.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.680
Plus or minus five degrees.
It's 40 in there.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.240
- The blocks are starting to burn.
- Cinder blocks.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.040
God.

Back off. Just back off.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:15.160
Back off. Just back off.

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:20.000
Back off.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.760
I wanna see my father.

01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:53.960
You better tell her something.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.880
Soon, Charlie.

01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.480
When you show us a little more.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:06.160
If you don't let me see him now,
I'll make something happen.

01:22:06.280 --> 01:22:09.040
Do you hear me?
I'll make something happen.

01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:18.680
<i>(television)</i>

<i>Well, instant banquet.</i>

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.320
<i>Nice, table companion.</i>

01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.400
<i>(Woody Woodpecker laughs)</i>

01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.560
I'm telling you, we're not through
with testing her.

01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:51.160
You saw what she's capable of.
She hasn't even reached her potential.

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:55.640
Perhaps Herman would like to see her
blow up a country before he gives in.

01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:58.680
I'm scientifically rational enough
not to form an opinion

01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:02.040
based on two experiments.

01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:05.840
I'm satisfied, yes, but only partially.

01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:10.480
Have you made the arrangements
regarding her father?

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.240
It's all taken care of.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.400
Night, Doc.

01:23:30.880 --> 01:23:32.960
Rainbird.

01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:35.040
Have you considered what might happen

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:37.720
if that girl found out
whose side you're really on?

01:23:37.840 --> 01:23:40.240
Oh, yes, I have.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.880
I'd say you stand a good chance of finding
out what a steak feels like in a microwave.

01:23:47.560 --> 01:23:50.320
Would you shed a bitter tear?

01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:54.360
No.

01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:57.320
No point in lying to you about that.

01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:03.200
When we find out
all we need to know from her...

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.200
When you give her to me.

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.600
What are you gonna do with her?

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.000
John the friendly orderly will come in.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.120
He will greet her, talk to her,
get her to smile.

01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:30.720
John the friendly orderly will make her
happy cos he's the only one who can.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.760
When John feels that she has reached
the moment of her greatest happiness,

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:42.480
he will strike her across the bridge
of the nose, breaking it explosively,

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.080
and sending bone fragments
into her brain.

01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:52.400
It'll be quick and he'll be
looking at her face at the time.

01:24:52.520 --> 01:24:55.560
He will know her power.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:00.600
And when he dies,

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:03.560
which I hope is very soon,

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:09.120
perhaps he can take that power with him
into the other world.

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:28.160
You are crazy.

01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:38.600
"(Hollister)" I've made all the arrangements
for you to go to Hawaii.

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:42.920
- Good. When am I going?
- Today.

01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:46.280
- Today?
- Well, 8.00 this evening.

01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:51.480
- How?
- First class comfort all the way.

01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:53.960
I mean, what's taking me?

01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.840
You go from here
by helicopter to the base,

01:25:56.960 --> 01:26:00.640
then the rest of the way
by army transport plane.

01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.960
Hmm.

01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:08.440
- 8.00?
- 8.00.

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:17.920
You know, that could bite you.

01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:21.520
- What?
- That snake you're holding.

01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:32.000
Christ, how did that get there?

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:35.360
I guess you just picked it up from a bush.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:39.160
I want you to contact that helicopter pilot.

01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.080
No.

01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.160
- Hey, guard.
- Shut up.

01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:47.680
Contact the pilot
and tell him you'll be coming along.

01:26:47.800 --> 01:26:49.840
I won't be coming along.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.040
Yes, of course I'm coming along.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:10.240
- My daughter will be with us.
- Oh, no.

01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.000
She can't come. She's far too dangerous.

01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:17.360
Oh, yeah? Well, who do you think
made her dangerous?

01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.400
My daughter is coming along.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:29.560
I don't want you to contradict me again,
do you understand?

01:27:29.680 --> 01:27:31.640
Yes, of course.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:43.880
You contact the helicopter and let him
take us as far as the army plane.

01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.920
There has to be a refuelling stop
between here and Hawaii.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.520
- We'll have to refuel in California.
- Yeah.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.320
OK.

01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:56.680
- Do you have paper and a pen?
- Sure.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.960
Here you go.

01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:03.320
I'm gonna write something
to my daughter.

01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:07.080
- You're gonna take it to her.
- Yes, of course.

01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:09.280
<i>Charlie, love.</i>

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:13.560
<i>First thing, when you finish reading this,</i>
<i>flush it down the toilet, OK?</i>

01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:16.880
<i>Second thing,</i>
<i>if everything goes the way I'm planning,</i>

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.400
<i>we're gonna be out of here tonight.</i>

01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:24.080
<i>Third thing,</i>
<i>I want you to be in the stables at 8.00.</i>

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:26.280
<i>I'll arrange for somebody to bring you.</i>

01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:29.400
<i>I miss you, Charlie. I love you so much.</i>

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.040
<i>(bleeping)</i>

01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:35.000
- John!
- Hi, baby.

01:28:36.920 --> 01:28:41.040
- I have to talk to you.
- Yeah, what about?

01:28:41.160 --> 01:28:42.840
I'll tell you in the hall.

01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:47.440
- They listen here.
- Right.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:53.560
My daddy's found a way
for us to get out of here.

01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.120
I'm supposed to meet him
at the stables at 8.00 tonight.

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.840
- That's great. How did he do it?
- I don't know, but isn't it wonderful?

01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.080
Better. It's a miracle. I'll take you.

01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:07.600
No, you'd get in trouble.
I wouldn't do that to you. You're my friend.

01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.840
I appreciate that, Charlie,
but I'd do anything for you.

01:29:13.960 --> 01:29:15.240
<i>(bleeping)</i>

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.560
Hi, Charlie.

01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:26.040
My name's Mike. Captain Hollister has
assigned me to take you to the stables.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.360
- What time?
- Well, let's see.

01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:32.920
I'll be back for you
about quarter to eight this evening.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:36.160
So, what's going on?

01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.720
- I asked if I could go riding at night-time.
- Oh?

01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:42.920
Sure, kid, anything you want.

01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:45.320
- Bye.
- See you later.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.440
<i>(whinneying)</i>

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:03.440
Come to me, Charlie.

01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.080
OK, let's check you in here.

01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.200
Hey!

01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:25.440
Anybody here?

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:28.480
- You can go now.
- I have the kid with me.

01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.920
I said you can go now!

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:39.800
- Get out of here.
- Can't do it, Charlie.

01:31:44.960 --> 01:31:47.280
Back off. Back off.

01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:55.000
Get out of here, you bastard,
or I'll burn you up, I'll fry you.

01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.760
Charlie.

01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.840
Charlie.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:07.560
John? John?

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:10.800
- Where are you?
- I'm up here.

01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.840
John...

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.960
I'm really glad you're here
but if anybody found out...

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:26.520
That doesn't matter any more.
The only thing that matters is you and me.

01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:28.920
How'd you get Charlie to cooperate?

01:32:29.040 --> 01:32:31.920
- Rainbird got her to do it.
- Who's Rainbird?

01:32:32.040 --> 01:32:36.720
He's an agent, an exterminator. Charlene
thinks he's an orderly named John.

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:40.480
Come on up, Charlie. Come to John.

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:43.640
- My father should be here any minute.
- I know.

01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.920
Hurry. Climb up now. Come to John.

01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:51.040
That's it. Come on.

01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:52.960
Good.

01:32:53.080 --> 01:32:56.280
Good girl. Right...

01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:58.480
- "(Andy)" Are you armed?
- "(Hollister)" Yes.

01:32:59.440 --> 01:33:02.280
- Charlie?
- Daddy!

01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.720
Yeah. Oh.

01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:24.120
- Let me look at you.
- Is it true? Are we really going away?

01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:28.480
Yes, it's true, we're really going away.

01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:31.640
Baby.

01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:36.080
- You pushed him.
- You're right.

01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:41.800
- My friend John is here.
- The orderly?

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:45.800
Yeah, he's up there.

01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:49.760
Couldn't we take him with us
if he wants to come?

01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:55.840
He's the one that shot us, baby.
He's the one that brought us here.

01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:59.000
Oh, no, Daddy, that's John.
He took care of my room.

01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.080
No.

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.160
He is with them.

01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.920
- It isn't true, is it?
- Yes, it's true.

01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:21.400
- Where are you, you son of a bitch?
- You tricked me, you lied to me.

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:27.560
No, I just mixed up the truth a little,
Charlie. And I did it to save your life.

01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:32.000
You come down here before I set
everything on fire, cos I can do it.

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:34.160
I know you can.

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:37.240
But if you do, you're gonna burn up
an awful lot of horses.

01:34:37.360 --> 01:34:42.200
Can't you hear them?
Necromancer's in one of those stalls.

01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.320
No, I'm not gonna do it.

01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:55.280
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna burn.

01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:58.760
No! Back off.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.040
Please, don't. Back off.

01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.880
You're not gonna do it.

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:20.840
Don't. Back off. Back off!

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:27.960
What more do you want from us?
Why can't you just let us go?

01:35:28.080 --> 01:35:33.160
You can't just be let go. I don't think
your father even believes that now.

01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.640
- You're dangerous and you know it.
- That's not my fault.

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:41.160
I know that. I don't care about that.
I never did. All I care about is you.

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:45.160
Now, come up here!
Don't make me shoot your father.

01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:49.120
- Don't listen to him, Charlie.
- You promise he'll be all right?

01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.400
- I give you my real word.
- Don't do it, baby.

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.760
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.000
Kill him.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.160
Jump.

01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.080
No.

01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:36.760
No!

01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:39.560
Oh, Daddy! Are you hurt?

01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:42.720
- Charlie...
- Daddy! Daddy!

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:46.120
- You're bleeding.
- Charlie!

01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:48.680
Daddy!

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.880
- Look at me.
- Go on.

01:36:56.520 --> 01:36:58.880
Charlie, look at me.

01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.000
That's it. So I can see your eyes.

01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.720
I love you, Charlie.

01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:22.680
I love you.

<i>Converge on stables. Use caution.</i>
<i>It's the girl and she's using it.</i>

01:37:40.440 --> 01:37:43.960
You gotta get away if you can, Charlie.

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:49.720
If you have to kill anybody that gets
in your way, I want you to do it.

01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.160
You let them know that this is a war,
Charlie.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:57.400
You have to get out of here.

01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:00.080
Do it for me.

01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.200
Do it for me, baby, do you understand?

01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:12.080
You make it. You make it so they can't
ever do anything like this again.

01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.360
You'll have to burn it all down, baby.

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:20.440
Burn it all down.

01:38:22.240 --> 01:38:24.200
Daddy...

01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.840
Go on. Get outta here
before it all goes up.

Oh, no, Daddy.

Get the door. Ready?

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.000
