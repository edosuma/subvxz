WEBVTT

00:06.306 --> 00:08.340
Female reporter (french accent):
The authorities are

00:08.342 --> 00:09.608
Combing the city today,

00:09.610 --> 00:14.513
Wanted for the murder
of a marseille police officer.

00:14.515 --> 00:17.282
All right,
I'm really sorry about this.

00:17.284 --> 00:18.717
(bell dings)

00:18.719 --> 00:20.619
(man speaking french)

00:20.621 --> 00:22.621
(dinging)

00:22.623 --> 00:25.124
Reporter: ...He is to be
considered armed and dangerous.

00:25.126 --> 00:30.629
(news report continues,
indistinctly)

00:30.631 --> 00:33.332
Woman: What do we
do now, tony?

00:33.334 --> 00:34.600
We run.

01:10.103 --> 01:11.403
(knocking)

01:11.405 --> 01:12.638
Hey. Sorry
I'm late.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.106
I want to get in front

01:14.108 --> 01:15.607
Of this whole fender-bender
thing.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.709
Despite what the lady
from the insurance company says,

01:17.711 --> 01:19.278
I totally had the right of way.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.080
Excuse me?

01:21.082 --> 01:22.848
This isn't about the
surveillance van I totaled?

01:22.850 --> 01:23.816
It is now.

01:23.818 --> 01:24.817
Director.

01:24.819 --> 01:26.518
We'll circle back.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.554
This is admiral kendall.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.689
He replaced admiral chase
at the joint chiefs.

01:30.691 --> 01:35.227
Ncis marseille is overdue
for a refresher seminar

01:35.229 --> 01:36.695
On internet security.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.698
I want you to go
and run that seminar.

01:40.867 --> 01:42.868
(whispers):
Am I being punk'd?

01:42.870 --> 01:45.304
Ah.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.840
I see.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.741
So why am I really going?

01:49.743 --> 01:52.311
To get my daughter.
In marseille.

01:52.313 --> 01:55.314
Agents from the ncis office
there are bringing her in.

01:56.449 --> 01:58.784
You'll pick her up there.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.186
Your plane leaves in two hours.
Any questions?

02:01.188 --> 02:04.189
Just one. Why?

02:04.191 --> 02:06.425
Kendall: I've been asking myself
that for years.

02:06.427 --> 02:11.697
Amanda was valedictorian
in high school.

02:11.699 --> 02:14.666
Straight a's in college--
georgetown.

02:14.668 --> 02:17.569
And then she just
suddenly flunked out.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.872
She has spent the last two years
wasting her life,

02:19.874 --> 02:22.141
Jet-setting across europe

02:22.143 --> 02:24.676
With a group of international
trust fund brats,

02:24.678 --> 02:26.678
Partying in every capitol
on the continent.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.248
Well, maybe she just needed
to find herself, sir.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.583
Well, now it's gone too far.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.488
This is the daughter
of vladimir dunchenko,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.190
The russian arms dealer.

02:38.192 --> 02:40.592
He's the son
of an iranian cabinet member.

02:41.461 --> 02:43.795
And the girl in red is amanda.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.764
I'm vice chairman
of the joint chiefs.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.366
I can't have my daughter out
partying with gun dealers,

02:47.368 --> 02:48.901
Iranians and
god knows who.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.904
But worse,
I don't think amanda appreciates

02:51.906 --> 02:55.174
Just how vulnerable she is.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.709
There are too many
national security implications.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.912
Your official cover
legitimizes your assignment

02:59.914 --> 03:01.914
But not a word to anybody.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.416
Gibbs already knows.

03:04.418 --> 03:05.684
But nobody else.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.186
Nobody.

03:07.188 --> 03:08.887
Copy that.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.657
I'll bring her back safe, sir.

03:11.659 --> 03:13.725
Thank you.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.696
An internet security
seminar? You?

03:17.698 --> 03:20.632
Am I being punk'd?
No. Think
about it.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.834
Who do you know that surfs
more questionable web sites

03:22.836 --> 03:24.503
Than yours truly?

03:24.505 --> 03:26.438
Not something to be proud of.

03:26.440 --> 03:27.806
Mcgee: You have
a good point.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.841
That's what you get
for being a misogynist.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.977
What do you get if you kick
a dog? A trip to hawaii?

03:31.979 --> 03:33.312
Death by abby.

03:33.314 --> 03:34.580
Ducky:
Timothy, I need

03:34.582 --> 03:36.648
Your computer expertise again.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.917
The luminosity
is too feeble

03:38.919 --> 03:40.986
For my visual cortex.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.888
So you want me
to turn the brightness up?

03:42.890 --> 03:44.690
(chuckles)
be a dear.

03:44.692 --> 03:45.891
Got a new phone there, ducky?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.293
Yes. Against my will.

03:48.295 --> 03:52.864
Mr. Palmer has me addicted
to a game called symbolese.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.366
It wouldn't work
on my old phone.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.634
It's a bit
like charades.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.536
Bishop:
But with symbols.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.737
You create phrases

03:58.739 --> 04:00.639
And other players online try
to decipher them.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.774
This one is... Killing me.

04:03.643 --> 04:04.977
Angry hat...

04:04.979 --> 04:07.012
Gibbs:
Mad hatter tea party.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.248
And don't you have a plane
to catch?

04:09.250 --> 04:11.283
Uh, it doesn't leave for
another two hours, boss.

04:11.285 --> 04:12.718
And I've got everything I need
in my go bag.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.319
You keep a packed bag
in your desk?

04:14.321 --> 04:15.320
Who does that?

04:17.290 --> 04:19.324
Everybody.

04:19.326 --> 04:20.392
(phone ringing)
okay.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.393
Yeah. Gibbs.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.794
So where are you going?

04:22.796 --> 04:24.363
Tony's going to France.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.664
<i>Oui, oui,</i>
<i>monsieur.</i>

04:25.666 --> 04:26.999
<i>Je suis,</i> uh...

04:27.001 --> 04:29.001
(french accent):
Very special agent dinozzo.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.936
Ducky:
The french

04:30.938 --> 04:33.272
Do see arrogance as a virtue,

04:33.274 --> 04:35.007
So you'll be
welcome there.

04:35.009 --> 04:37.309
But remember, in France,

04:37.311 --> 04:38.910
Only tip six percent.

04:39.980 --> 04:42.381
Ooh, that's perfect.
You guys can drop me off

04:42.383 --> 04:44.049
On the way, at the airport.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.884
I need to practice
a few of these french phrases.

04:45.886 --> 04:48.353
I keep getting 'em wrong.

04:48.355 --> 04:49.955
Six percent.

04:52.392 --> 04:54.026
Not a centime more.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.360
Mmm.

04:55.362 --> 04:57.429
Ooh, hold that door!

05:07.307 --> 05:09.474
(waiter speaks french)
<i>merci.</i>

05:17.784 --> 05:19.451
Mcgee:
Calling to gloat?

05:19.453 --> 05:21.386
Oh, no.

05:21.388 --> 05:23.822
Tim, I have
a very serious question.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.058
What is six percent of 19?

05:26.060 --> 05:27.726
You're gloating, and I'm busy.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.461
What are you doing?
Still at a crime scene.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.330
A plumber discovered a body
inside of a septic tank

05:31.332 --> 05:33.732
By some off-base housing.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.934
Who's the victim?
Don't know yet.
He's really wedged in there,

05:35.936 --> 05:38.937
And ducky didn't want
to risk cutting the tank,

05:38.939 --> 05:40.372
So we flipped a coin
to see who's gonna go in there

05:40.374 --> 05:41.907
And pull him out manually.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.909
You used my trick coin,
didn't you?

05:43.911 --> 05:46.378
Well, with you gone,
I had a 50-50 shot

05:46.380 --> 05:49.381
And I could not risk losing it.
The smell is horrible.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.484
Oh, yeah. I hear you. It's kind
of like how the flight

05:52.486 --> 05:54.453
Was overbooked
on the way out, and, uh,

05:54.455 --> 05:56.388
I got bumped up to first class--
oh, wait, no, it's not.

05:56.390 --> 05:57.756
Yeah, brag all you want.
I'm just happy

05:57.758 --> 05:59.358
I'm not going in the tank.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.793
Put it on.
You're going in the tank.

06:01.795 --> 06:04.096
Boss, no, we-we
had an arrangement.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.531
Ciao.

06:09.469 --> 06:11.470
<i>Bonjour.</i>
<i>Special agent anthony dinozzo.</i>

06:11.472 --> 06:12.904
I brought pastries.

06:17.510 --> 06:20.545
(siren approaching)

06:27.820 --> 06:29.821
(tires screeching,
siren wailing)

06:36.429 --> 06:38.497
(speaking french)

06:38.499 --> 06:40.499
Police!
(speaking french)

06:40.501 --> 06:42.567
(officers shouting in french)

06:53.880 --> 06:56.882
Sometimes I love my job.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.884
And sometimes...

06:58.886 --> 07:02.888
I have to crawl
inside a giant septic tank.

07:02.890 --> 07:05.490
Well, it could be worse.
How?

07:05.492 --> 07:08.627
Well, I could have to... Climb
in there with you. (laughs)

07:08.629 --> 07:11.496
Hmph!
You get the I.D.
On the victim yet?

07:11.498 --> 07:13.598
Mr. Mush fingers?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.600
The body was too waterlogged
to pull a print

07:15.602 --> 07:17.102
And, sadly, he left home

07:17.104 --> 07:19.438
Without his american express
card or his wallet.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.507
But the body
was weighted down with rocks.

07:22.509 --> 07:24.609
Probably to keep it
from clogging the exit drain.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.478
(phone rings)
yeah, but the rocks had
to come from somewhere,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.180
So they could
tell us something.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.849
Hey, dinozzo. What's up?

07:30.851 --> 07:33.452
Is this inspector gibbs?
Special agent gibbs.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.455
Where is special agent dinozzo?
Don't worry. He's fine.

07:36.457 --> 07:39.090
However, I cannot say
the same for everyone
else in your office here.

07:39.092 --> 07:41.226
Why is agent dinozzo in cuffs?
Gibbs:
Cuffs?

07:41.228 --> 07:43.128
Because they are dead
and he is not.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.230
Wait, wait. Who is dead?

07:45.232 --> 07:47.966
Release him. Now.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.006
<i>Merci.</i>

07:55.008 --> 07:57.108
<i>De rien.</i>

07:57.110 --> 07:59.678
Brief your superior.
Then we talk.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.915
Gibbs, this is dinozzo.

08:03.917 --> 08:06.251
They're all dead.
I came into the ncis office,

08:06.253 --> 08:08.053
Everyone was dead.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.988
Gunned down.
Looks like close range.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.089
Smells recent.

08:11.091 --> 08:16.228
What about amanda?
All five ncis employees.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.129
Understood. You all right?

08:18.131 --> 08:20.031
Yeah, I'm fine.
I got a lot of...

08:20.033 --> 08:22.033
People here
keeping me safe.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.236
Understood.
I got to brief vance.

08:24.238 --> 08:27.506
You get someplace private
and you call me back.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.274
It's a date.

08:35.214 --> 08:37.215
Did you know them?

08:37.217 --> 08:40.785
No. Not personally. But, uh...

08:40.787 --> 08:42.654
No, I-I understand.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.656
My condolences.

08:44.658 --> 08:48.193
Gerard tells me you
were here for, um...

08:48.195 --> 08:50.962
Uh, what is it called again?

08:50.964 --> 08:53.064
Internet security seminar.
Really?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.799
Mmm.
Mmm.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.536
Usually computer experts
are not so, uh...

08:57.538 --> 09:00.739
...So.

09:00.741 --> 09:03.241
Are you flirting with me
at a crime scene, inspector?

09:03.243 --> 09:06.278
No. Maybe. I don't know.
Does it matter?

09:06.280 --> 09:09.180
Your timing could be better.

09:09.182 --> 09:11.182
Maybe you're only uncomfortable

09:11.184 --> 09:13.251
Because you're not used
to being a witness.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.321
Speaking of which,
do you know this person?

09:22.562 --> 09:24.663
No.
She entered through
the front door, but...

09:24.665 --> 09:26.331
A witness saw her crawl
out a back window,

09:26.333 --> 09:28.667
So at the moment,
she's our only suspect.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.735
Or a lucky victim
who got away.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.270
You sure you do not know her?

09:32.272 --> 09:35.173
I never forget
a pretty face.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.175
Which means I'm gonna have yours

09:37.177 --> 09:39.911
Stuck in my head
for the rest of my life.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.247
(wry laugh)
okay.

09:42.249 --> 09:45.817
<i>Bon.</i> That's all for now.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.721
But would it be
possible for you

09:49.723 --> 09:52.324
To stay in marseille
for a few days

09:52.326 --> 09:54.326
While I finish my investigation?

09:54.328 --> 09:58.163
I would be happy to show you
the sights, if you become bored.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.297
I'm sure that
would be lovely.

09:59.299 --> 10:00.699
Good.

10:00.701 --> 10:02.334
Perhaps after we probe your gun.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.636
<i>Excusez-moi?</i>
<i>Your gun.</i>

10:04.638 --> 10:06.137
We need to examine it
to make sure

10:06.139 --> 10:10.875
Like gerard says,
they are dead, you are not.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.677
Just being thorough.

10:13.646 --> 10:15.347
Right.

10:15.349 --> 10:18.350
Of course.

10:18.352 --> 10:20.118
My gun.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.187
<i>Merci.</i>
<i>De rien.</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:30.629
Vance:
Yes, madame secretary,
we want answers, too.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.264
We already have one of
our best agents on the ground.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.835
You'll know
when we know.

10:36.837 --> 10:38.937
And we still don't know
anything, do we?

10:38.939 --> 10:40.639
I talked to
dinozzo again.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.273
Two of the victims
were ncis agents.

10:42.275 --> 10:44.409
The other three
were local hires.

10:44.411 --> 10:46.745
Was he able to get their I.D.?
Yeah. Mcgee's running
background now.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.179
When do we leave?
Working on it.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.314
State's negotiating
with the french

10:49.316 --> 10:51.383
For a joint investigation.

10:51.385 --> 10:54.786
Gibbs...
Admiral kendall's daughter--

10:54.788 --> 10:56.421
You sure she
got away?
Yup.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.323
Could she be
the shooter?
Not likely,

10:58.325 --> 11:00.725
But she might know who was.
Then agent dinozzo's
first priority

11:00.727 --> 11:01.893
Is to find her.
He will.

11:01.895 --> 11:05.664
Straight to the airport
and home. I got it.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.333
Well, at least the media
hasn't picked up on this yet.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.668
It gives me some time.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.703
Time for what?

11:11.705 --> 11:14.673
To prepare for my next
phone call... To the admiral.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.678
Unless you'd like
to make that call.

11:19.680 --> 11:22.681
I would rather get in
that septic tank.

11:26.085 --> 11:28.453
â™ª

11:35.695 --> 11:38.763
Bonsoir.

11:38.765 --> 11:40.131
Avez-vous vu cette femme?

11:40.133 --> 11:41.399
<i>Non.</i>

11:41.401 --> 11:44.002
No?

11:47.039 --> 11:48.973
Avez-vous vu cette femme?

11:48.975 --> 11:50.742
You should stick
to english.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.343
And, yes, I've
seen amanda.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.712
She's over there.

11:55.414 --> 11:58.349
But be careful.
She bites.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.018
Bottle shots!
Bottle shots!

12:00.020 --> 12:01.052
Man:
Here we go!

12:01.054 --> 12:03.788
(onlookers shouting)
go, go, go!

12:04.423 --> 12:06.224
I'm gonna get this, amanda!

12:06.226 --> 12:08.293
(laughs)
that's great!

12:08.295 --> 12:10.028
Man:
And the grand finale!

12:11.897 --> 12:13.732
(chuckles)
(coughs, laughs)

12:13.734 --> 12:15.300
Where is amir?

12:15.302 --> 12:16.735
Man: I don't know
where he is!

12:16.737 --> 12:18.103
Woman:
Amanda, look at this!

12:18.105 --> 12:20.371
Oh, instagram that.
Show him what he's missing.

12:20.373 --> 12:21.740
Hi, amanda.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.074
Nice haircut.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.511
How'd you find me?
Luck.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.046
And the thousand
tweets you've sent

12:28.048 --> 12:29.981
From every nightclub
you've ever been to.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.483
We need to talk.
No, you don't.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.818
Khan and I don't care

12:33.820 --> 12:36.421
How many goons her
father sends after her.

12:36.423 --> 12:37.956
She's staying with us.

12:37.958 --> 12:40.425
Don't you have a timecard
to punch or something?

12:40.427 --> 12:41.760
You don't know.

12:41.762 --> 12:45.764
Know what?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.766
All of them?

12:47.768 --> 12:49.134
They're all dead?

12:49.136 --> 12:50.502
And you didn't see anything?

12:50.504 --> 12:53.538
No. Nothing.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.973
Then why'd you crawl
out a window?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.508
(sighs)

12:56.510 --> 13:00.378
My dad sent an ncis agent
to pick me up at my hotel.

13:00.380 --> 13:03.882
So, after he brought
me back to his office,

13:03.884 --> 13:05.984
I went to the bathroom,
climbed out the window

13:05.986 --> 13:07.418
And checked into a new hotel.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.521
Thanksgiving must be fun
at your house.

13:09.523 --> 13:12.223
Did the police catch
the killer?
No.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.859
And right now, amanda,
you're their only suspect.

13:14.861 --> 13:16.294
But I'm... I'm just...

13:16.296 --> 13:19.030
Shallow and vacuous,
but no killer.

13:19.032 --> 13:22.801
You have to tell them that.
Right now, I'm more concerned
about you being a target.

13:22.803 --> 13:23.434
Me?!

13:23.436 --> 13:24.536
You're the only witness,

13:24.538 --> 13:26.871
And the killers don't know
what you saw.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.807
You're safe with me.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.842
But we need to get out
of here right now,

13:30.844 --> 13:32.877
And we need to go
straight to the airport.

13:32.879 --> 13:35.380
I'm not gonna have to follow you
into the restroom

13:35.382 --> 13:37.549
Every time you have
to take a leak, am I?

13:37.551 --> 13:39.584
Are we good?
Yeah, we're good.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.586
Let's blow.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.154
Okay, thanks.
Lila...

13:43.156 --> 13:44.489
Hey, I have to leave.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.024
If you see amir,

13:46.026 --> 13:47.358
Have him call me?

13:47.360 --> 13:48.893
It's important.

13:48.895 --> 13:50.328
Lila:
Okay. I will.

13:53.966 --> 13:55.300
Who's amir?

13:55.302 --> 13:57.302
Nobody.

13:57.304 --> 14:00.071
A boy.
What's he gonna inherit
when his parents croak?

14:00.073 --> 14:02.407
Nothing.
He doesn't come from money.

14:02.409 --> 14:04.142
All right,
his-his father's

14:04.144 --> 14:06.177
An-an iranian
politician.

14:06.179 --> 14:08.046
And that means
my father doesn't like him.

14:08.048 --> 14:09.514
Shut up.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.188
I had a feeling you were not
being completely honest with me,

14:17.190 --> 14:18.523
So I had you followed.

14:18.525 --> 14:19.591
I didn't shoot anybody!

14:19.593 --> 14:21.259
I hope that's true, but

14:21.261 --> 14:23.094
You still need
to come with me to the station

14:23.096 --> 14:24.629
To be questioned.
Tony:
If it's all the same to you,

14:24.631 --> 14:26.497
How about we handle this
at the u.S. Consulate?

14:26.499 --> 14:28.032
(wry laugh)

14:28.034 --> 14:31.369
You would never allow
such a thing, agent dinozzo.

14:31.371 --> 14:34.305
And you know,
neither can I.

14:34.307 --> 14:35.974
Come to the station.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.442
Your gun-- it's been analyzed.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.345
You can pick it up, and...

14:40.347 --> 14:43.314
Maybe we can go see some
of the sights I spoke about.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.616
(laughs)

14:44.618 --> 14:46.150
Gee, that sounds nice.

14:46.152 --> 14:47.952
But I think
I should call my boss first.

14:47.954 --> 14:49.988
Ah, wait.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.523
I have your gun
right here.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.430
Let's get out of here!

14:59.432 --> 15:00.965
ArrÃªtez!
Tony: Run!

15:09.341 --> 15:11.342
Your prognosis?

15:11.344 --> 15:12.443
It's not good.

15:12.445 --> 15:14.178
Ah, I hate to lose a patient.

15:14.180 --> 15:16.481
Uh, uh, wait. I think
I found the problem.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.650
Looks like the system
drive is full.

15:18.652 --> 15:20.985
How many apps
did you install, doctor?

15:20.987 --> 15:22.654
There's a limit?

15:22.656 --> 15:24.689
Triviamania, triviagod,

15:24.691 --> 15:26.391
Encyclopedia
of everything.

15:26.393 --> 15:29.360
And I see you beat
my high score in symbolese?

15:29.362 --> 15:32.597
Don't confuse age
with rust, mr. Palmer.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.065
Ah, jethro.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.433
Any word on marseille?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.101
Just spoke
to their coroner.

15:37.103 --> 15:38.403
Should be getting
the bodies back soon.

15:38.405 --> 15:39.704
Until then,
what do you got, duck?

15:39.706 --> 15:42.407
Oh, as usual, more
than meets the eye.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.442
I understand
that abby was able

15:44.444 --> 15:47.278
To make an I.D. From
our dental records.
Yeah.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.314
Matched to a missing person.
A zach martin?

15:49.316 --> 15:50.682
Runs an employment office?

15:50.684 --> 15:53.418
Really?
Well, given what we found,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.720
I was expecting
something sexier.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.222
Sexier, ducky?

15:58.224 --> 16:00.325
Jimmy:
Yeah, cause of death
was blood loss due to multiple

16:00.327 --> 16:01.693
Puncture wounds.
Yes.

16:01.695 --> 16:04.562
He's also missing
several fingernails,

16:04.564 --> 16:07.632
And suffered extreme
periodontal trauma,

16:07.634 --> 16:10.468
Reminiscent of the
movie <i>marathon man.</i>

16:10.470 --> 16:12.303
Been tortured?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.639
Jimmy:
Hardly an occupational hazard
for a paper-pusher.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.208
Is agent dinozzo
returning soon?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.543
Yeah, he texted me last night.

16:18.545 --> 16:20.111
He should be on the plane now.

16:20.113 --> 16:22.547
Hold on...
Tony: Come on.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.048
Amanda:
Can we stop for a second?

16:24.050 --> 16:25.383
We need
to keep moving.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.251
No, we need to
call the police.

16:27.253 --> 16:30.421
What, so they can, uh,
try to kill us again?

16:30.423 --> 16:32.256
No. The other police.
The good ones.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.258
Well, they don't exactly
come with labels, amanda.

16:34.260 --> 16:35.727
I am hungry, all right?

16:35.729 --> 16:38.396
My feet are killing me.
Please, please, please.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.598
Okay.

16:40.600 --> 16:44.736
(sighs)
so, what's the plan?

16:44.738 --> 16:47.338
Well, it depends what inspector
cheblis wants with you.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.140
I have no idea.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.142
Six people are dead. Think.
I've been thinking.

16:51.144 --> 16:52.777
It's not one of my
strengths, okay?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.312
You think.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.780
Well, I think we can't
go to the consulate.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.281
They'll be watching.

16:57.283 --> 16:59.450
I need to call ncis.

17:01.320 --> 17:04.555
You doing it
telepathically, or...?

17:04.557 --> 17:07.658
They had my cell phone, which
means they have my contacts.

17:07.660 --> 17:10.661
Calling's a risk.

17:10.663 --> 17:14.565
Inspector cheblis probably has
her own bizarro world mcgee

17:14.567 --> 17:16.401
Monitoring cell towers.

17:16.403 --> 17:20.438
They could be tracking
your cell right now!

17:20.440 --> 17:22.507
Ugh!

17:22.509 --> 17:24.175
Like in a spy movie?

17:24.177 --> 17:27.645
Except I took the battery out
five hours ago.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.148
Oops?

17:30.150 --> 17:32.183
Now we're even?

17:32.185 --> 17:35.586
No. Now we don't even
have a cell phone.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.588
This is what happens
when I don't sleep

17:37.590 --> 17:40.091
Or eat, or get
chased all night

17:40.093 --> 17:42.727
By killer cops.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.530
Sit up. We will make
a little pit stop

17:45.532 --> 17:47.632
To satisfy your... Hunger.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.367
Thank you.

17:49.369 --> 17:50.701
And then we need
to get out of marseille.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.337
You know, this city
has over 1,800

17:53.339 --> 17:56.074
Police surveillance cameras.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.776
It's just a matter of time
before they catch us.

17:58.778 --> 18:02.280
So, what's the plan?

18:03.749 --> 18:07.351
Well, we're gonna rent a car,
and we're gonna drive

18:07.353 --> 18:09.253
To the satellite ncis office
in rota, Spain.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.389
It's only about
a 15-hour drive.
Oh, god.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.658
Stop it.
Ugh! Ow!

18:14.760 --> 18:17.662
(news broadcast
playing indistinctly

18:18.864 --> 18:20.298
Hey.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.801
Ugh. I know. <i>Bonjour.</i>

18:23.803 --> 18:25.203
Uh... <i>S'il vous plaÃ®t...</i>

18:25.205 --> 18:26.671
Female reporter:
...An american national

18:26.673 --> 18:30.141
Wanted for the murder of
a marseille police officer.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.844
The suspect-- special agent
anthony dinozzo

18:32.846 --> 18:35.746
...A federal agent
from the United States...

18:38.584 --> 18:40.651
Amanda:
What do we do now, tony?

18:40.653 --> 18:42.320
We run.

18:45.224 --> 18:46.591
Renting a car is out.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.259
So is public transportation.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.527
I have an idea.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.762
Will I like it?

18:51.764 --> 18:54.532
Depends on how you feel
about progressive trance.

18:59.771 --> 19:02.473
Whoo!
Here they come!

19:03.575 --> 19:05.443
(laughs)

19:05.445 --> 19:07.278
(laughing):
Oh, amanda panda!

19:07.280 --> 19:09.614
Natasha kasha!

19:09.616 --> 19:11.549
Kasha?
Whole grain
buckwheat cereal.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.718
You should try it.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.753
Maybe try
smiling, too?

19:15.755 --> 19:17.622
Let's go!

19:17.624 --> 19:19.857
Can't believe I'm putting
my life in the hands of the cast

19:19.859 --> 19:21.492
From <i>less than zero.</i>
<i>From what?</i>

19:21.494 --> 19:22.860
Never mind. (sighs)

19:22.862 --> 19:24.662
What if they've seen me on tv?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.531
Don't worry. These guys don't
exactly watch the news.

19:26.533 --> 19:30.835
(music blaring,
people whooping)

19:37.676 --> 19:38.776
(woman speaks french)

19:41.180 --> 19:43.414
Dear god, give me strength.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.716
Amanda panda!
Khan juan!

19:45.718 --> 19:46.717
(laughter)
oh, my gosh!

19:46.719 --> 19:47.852
Hey, where's amir?

19:47.854 --> 19:49.654
Oh, he's with lila.

19:49.656 --> 19:50.922
They were thinking about maybe
going to switzerland.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.823
We were gonna join them, but

19:52.825 --> 19:54.559
Since you needed a ride to rota,

19:54.561 --> 19:55.960
We're gonna hit the beaches
at marbella instead.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.497
Rota! Rota!

19:59.499 --> 20:01.632
Everyone (chanting):
Rota! Rota! Rota!

20:01.634 --> 20:02.900
This is a bad idea.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.370
Let me guess: Catch amir
before he heads to switzerland?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.940
No.
Listen, we're going to rota.

20:08.942 --> 20:11.742
Sounds like everybody
else wants to go.

20:11.744 --> 20:14.612
I just need to call my boss.

20:14.614 --> 20:16.214
Well, I thought you said
it was too risky to call.

20:19.518 --> 20:21.852
It is.

20:21.854 --> 20:23.688
I have a better idea.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.957
(bus engine revving)

20:25.959 --> 20:28.526
Bishop: <i>I just think</i>
<i>it's quite a coincidence.</i>

20:28.528 --> 20:31.629
Every time we flip a coin,
I end up on the losing side.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.998
Well, conditional probability
suggests...

20:34.000 --> 20:37.969
I wrote my senior thesis on
conditional probability, tim.

20:37.971 --> 20:40.004
Be honest.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.939
You were using
a trick coin.

20:41.941 --> 20:43.608
Tim?

20:43.610 --> 20:45.810
I am not using a
trick coin, I swear.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.979
You lying little bitch.

20:47.981 --> 20:50.481
Um... Excuse me,

20:50.483 --> 20:52.883
We're agents bishop
and mcgee from ncis.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.419
Need to have a word
with you about your boss.
Oh!

20:55.421 --> 20:57.588
Those are <i>my</i> goldfish.
Who are you kidding?

20:57.590 --> 20:59.991
I'm sorry, mr. Martin
is busy at the moment.
Busy?

20:59.993 --> 21:02.827
You mean...
In his office?

21:02.829 --> 21:05.630
Yes. And he only
sees people by appointment.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.466
No, that's the reason
you're still single, honey.

21:08.468 --> 21:10.768
Sure gets around a lot
for a dead guy.
Yeah...

21:10.770 --> 21:12.703
Oh, wait!
You can't go in there.

21:12.705 --> 21:16.874
Hmm. So where's
mr. Martin?

21:16.876 --> 21:18.876
Well, he must have stepped out
when I wasn't looking.

21:18.878 --> 21:20.344
Oh, yeah? When was that?

21:20.346 --> 21:22.713
Last week?
Oh, my god.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.016
More than a week.
This place is covered in dust.

21:25.018 --> 21:26.751
When was the last time
your boss was here?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.786
I don't know.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.854
(phone chimes)

21:29.856 --> 21:31.689
Okay, your goldfish
can wait.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.658
Mcgee: Your desk is
right beside his office--

21:33.660 --> 21:36.861
How do you not know?
I've... I've never met him.

21:36.863 --> 21:40.564
And he conducts all
of his business by phone.

21:40.566 --> 21:42.967
Okay, well, we're gonna
need a list of his clients.

21:42.969 --> 21:43.968
Okay.

21:43.970 --> 21:46.003
I can do that.

21:46.005 --> 21:47.938
Except...
What?

21:47.940 --> 21:49.807
He doesn't have any.

21:49.809 --> 21:51.942
He told me he's
a headhunter, but

21:51.944 --> 21:53.778
I've never met
anyone he's headhunted.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.646
So what the hell
has he been doing?

21:57.082 --> 21:58.983
Well, he wasn't
using his computer.

21:58.985 --> 22:02.353
Or his stylish fountain pen.
Or his stapler.

22:02.355 --> 22:04.088
None of this stuff
has been used, gibbs.

22:04.090 --> 22:06.023
This zach guy set up
an office

22:06.025 --> 22:10.761
And pretended
to work there for years.

22:10.763 --> 22:11.996
Abbs?

22:11.998 --> 22:14.098
I pulled some old prints.

22:14.100 --> 22:16.334
Probably from when
the office was set up.

22:16.336 --> 22:19.036
But I didn't get
any hits on afis.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.441
You want to tell me
what's up?

22:24.376 --> 22:26.344
A giant septic tank.

22:26.346 --> 22:27.812
And it's full of...

22:27.814 --> 22:30.114
You know...
And the smell, it's just...

22:30.116 --> 22:32.049
Stuck in my... Ugh.

22:32.051 --> 22:33.851
I-I mean, blood...

22:33.853 --> 22:35.119
Blood, I can handle.

22:35.121 --> 22:37.388
You know. And brains,
I-I like brains.

22:37.390 --> 22:39.890
You know, but... Just,
a septic tank, it's...

22:39.892 --> 22:42.393
It's a lot harder.

22:43.929 --> 22:45.529
Thank you.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.131
I have this for you.

22:47.133 --> 22:50.368
A mug from
the georgetown hoyas.

22:50.370 --> 22:53.771
On a whim, I checked
georgetown's enrollment records,

22:53.773 --> 22:55.373
And I did not
find zach martin.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.841
So, on a double whim,

22:56.843 --> 22:58.142
I ran facial recognition

22:58.144 --> 22:59.143
Against the
school's yearbooks.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.745
And you got a hit.

23:00.747 --> 23:01.946
I did.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.481
Zach martin
is an alias.

23:03.483 --> 23:06.050
His real name
is zakaria hassan.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.818
He was on
the debate team team and

23:07.820 --> 23:09.987
Was enrolled in the
engineering school...

23:09.989 --> 23:11.055
Blow that up,
right there.

23:15.460 --> 23:17.828
Amanda kendall.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.897
She went to school
with our victim.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.707
(phone line ringing)
you know,
I knew tony would never

23:29.709 --> 23:31.942
Be picked for
an internet security seminar.

23:31.944 --> 23:33.944
Errand boy makes
much more sense.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.013
You've reached very special
agent anthony dinozzo...

23:36.015 --> 23:38.716
(sighs) still going
straight to voice mail.

23:38.718 --> 23:40.751
Tony's plane came into dulles
ten minutes ago.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.952
He wasn't on it.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.054
Why would he go off the grid?
He wouldn't.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.890
Unless he had a reason.

23:45.892 --> 23:47.925
Or it wasn't his choice.

23:47.927 --> 23:48.993
He's got a reason.

23:55.033 --> 23:56.734
What's he wanted for?

23:56.736 --> 23:58.936
Murdering a french cop.
Well, we should go.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.205
No, we should wait
for tony to contact us.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.707
We work the case.
That's how we help dinozzo.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.777
Zakaria hassan.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.112
All we know
for sure is that

24:08.114 --> 24:10.147
He went to college
with amanda kendall.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.782
His murder
could be a coincidence.

24:11.784 --> 24:13.851
Mcgee.
Rule 39, bishop.

24:13.853 --> 24:15.820
Right. Uh, no such thing
as a coincidence.

24:15.822 --> 24:16.954
I knew that one.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.923
Hassan lived under an alias,

24:18.925 --> 24:20.891
Ran a dummy corporation

24:20.893 --> 24:22.993
And then was tortured to death
days before amanda kendall

24:22.995 --> 24:25.763
Escaped the massacre
at ncis marseille.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.032
What was he into?
We searched his home
in norfolk.

24:28.034 --> 24:29.867
It was clean.
Abby's got his laptop.
Jimmy: You guys...

24:29.869 --> 24:31.969
Guys, you got to check this out.
Jimmy, we don't have time

24:31.971 --> 24:35.239
For picture games.
No, it's not about
the game, it's not about

24:35.241 --> 24:37.041
The game-- well, technically,
it is about the game.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.076
I was in the middle
of a round-robin and a new user

24:39.078 --> 24:41.779
Invited me to play.
And...

24:46.751 --> 24:49.487
It's, uh...
It's-it's tony,

24:49.489 --> 24:51.121
It's a message
from tony.

24:51.123 --> 24:54.091
According to the screen name,
it's from khantempt111.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.160
No. It's tony. It's tony.
I'm confident.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.495
Explain how.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.830
Well, start with
the first image.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.932
It's a stick figure
with x's for the eyes.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.501
Now, historically, cartoonists
have used this imagery

25:03.503 --> 25:05.503
To illustrate
death because...

25:05.505 --> 25:06.971
Palmer?

25:06.973 --> 25:08.072
Explain faster.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.006
Right. Um...

25:09.008 --> 25:10.975
Autopsy... Gremlin.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.977
Autopsy gremlin.
That's me.

25:12.979 --> 25:15.079
Okay. Is there more?

25:15.081 --> 25:16.981
Well, yeah, but the second one's
a little harder.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.916
You got a bus
and a road.

25:18.918 --> 25:20.918
Now, is the
bus on the road?

25:20.920 --> 25:22.086
Is the bus
avoiding the road?

25:22.088 --> 25:23.854
Is bus the name
of the road?

25:23.856 --> 25:26.056
Rota. Spain?

25:26.058 --> 25:28.092
Ncis has a satellite
office there.

25:28.094 --> 25:29.093
Tony must be on his way.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.561
That would
explain the map

25:30.563 --> 25:32.963
Of Spain he sent next.

25:32.965 --> 25:34.031
Can you send a message back?

25:34.033 --> 25:35.199
Mm-hmm.

25:41.907 --> 25:43.974
(music blaring)

25:51.783 --> 25:53.651
(chuckles)
I'm not drinking that.

25:53.653 --> 25:54.919
What do you think's in it?

25:54.921 --> 25:56.120
Rohypnol, ghb,

25:56.122 --> 25:58.856
Whatever roofie
your buddy khan is on.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.190
You don't care for my friends.

26:00.192 --> 26:02.026
Listen, sweetheart,

26:02.028 --> 26:03.994
I went to boarding school
with a version

26:03.996 --> 26:06.063
Of each one of these clowns,
and you know what?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.598
Like most people,
I find clowns

26:07.600 --> 26:09.233
Unfunny and a
little frightening.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.335
Well, if it weren't for them,
we'd still be stranded

26:11.337 --> 26:12.970
In parc du centenaire.

26:12.972 --> 26:16.006
They disturb me.
What can I tell you?

26:16.008 --> 26:18.175
I am a continent.
I contain multitudes.

26:20.178 --> 26:22.046
Bro, you got a message back.

26:24.015 --> 26:26.884
Oh! Thank god, I knew
I could rely on jimmy.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.819
Khan: I think it's saying
behind the badge...

26:28.821 --> 26:31.255
(hiccups)
...There's nothingness.

26:31.257 --> 26:33.190
I think it's saying

26:33.192 --> 26:35.225
Agents will meet us
at the border.

26:38.129 --> 26:39.597
Oh, yeah. Hmm.

26:40.699 --> 26:42.199
All right, we're going home.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.001
My home's in marseille.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.135
No, your boyfriend's
in marseille,

26:45.137 --> 26:46.704
With the "persian hilton."

26:46.706 --> 26:49.206
And you're welcome,
by the way.
For what?

26:49.208 --> 26:51.809
For saving your boney ass,
princess leia.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.211
(tablet blipping)

26:54.213 --> 26:56.080
Oh. Hold that thought.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.182
Just got another
message from ncis.

26:58.184 --> 27:00.284
This is a little complicated,
it might take a second.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.088
You smell that?

27:04.090 --> 27:06.123
It's a party bus,
they're partying.

27:09.728 --> 27:11.795
Stop the bus.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.665
What?

27:14.667 --> 27:16.734
(coughing)

27:20.405 --> 27:23.107
Fire started in the bathroom,
ruined the exhaust system.

27:23.109 --> 27:26.243
Got to wait
for the fire brigade.

27:26.245 --> 27:28.212
Need my cell to call dad.
He's gonna be pissed.

27:29.781 --> 27:32.182
This bus was my sister's
graduation gift.

27:35.720 --> 27:37.721
I mean, if this isn't a sign

27:37.723 --> 27:39.289
That we should
head back to marseille,

27:39.291 --> 27:41.258
I don't...
We're not. Let's go.

27:41.260 --> 27:42.760
What-- we're gonna
walk to Spain?

27:42.762 --> 27:44.395
We can't stay here,
amanda panda.

27:44.397 --> 27:45.696
Why not?

27:45.698 --> 27:47.331
(sirens approaching)
shh.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.201
What did the message say?

27:51.203 --> 27:52.836
That's gonna
be the fire brigade.

27:52.838 --> 27:54.438
Followed by the police.

27:54.440 --> 27:56.440
Look, there's gonna be a town
up ahead-- let's go.

27:58.009 --> 28:00.010
Yes, I would
appreciate a call back

28:00.012 --> 28:01.979
From the chief,
as soon as he can.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.914
Ye... I understand.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.049
Man (over phone):
Thank you.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.383
No. Thank you.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.820
Making friends with
the marseille police?

28:09.822 --> 28:11.255
Have to return
my calls first.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.290
And the ambassador's
giving me the runaround.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.925
Please tell me dinozzo
made it to the border.

28:14.927 --> 28:15.926
Never showed.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.162
Damn it.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.830
In one of his last messages,

28:19.832 --> 28:21.832
He said something
about a dirty cop.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.934
If that cop caught
up with him...

28:23.936 --> 28:25.903
Bishop:
We could have an
international incident.

28:25.905 --> 28:28.706
Oh, we passed "incident"
five dead bodies ago.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.974
If it were
up to admiral kendall,

28:30.976 --> 28:34.211
He'd authorize seal team six
to exfil his daughter.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.746
Well, one way to go.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.347
I'm warming to the idea.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.384
Why are you here?

28:40.386 --> 28:44.154
Abby found hidden files
on zakaria hassan's laptop.

28:44.156 --> 28:48.492
I have to call admiral kendall
and talk him off a ledge.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.928
Unless those files
contain something
about his daughter,

28:50.930 --> 28:52.296
It's gonna
have to wait.

28:52.298 --> 28:53.964
I wouldn't
make that call.

28:57.168 --> 28:58.435
They have to do
with his daughter?

28:58.437 --> 29:00.104
I-it's complicated.

29:00.106 --> 29:02.139
(hangs up phone)
what'd you find?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.974
Classified
intelligence documents.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.944
Defense intelligence
login procedures,

29:06.946 --> 29:09.246
Uh, protocols, ciphers...

29:13.184 --> 29:16.019
Hassan was a spy. For who?

29:16.021 --> 29:18.789
So far, we've only been able
to decode a single message.

29:18.791 --> 29:21.191
It came from a dod
proprietary server.
Meaning?

29:21.193 --> 29:23.293
Message was from one of our own.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.529
And that's where it gets...
Complicated.

29:29.968 --> 29:31.235
Two of your agents are dead,

29:31.237 --> 29:33.237
Another is wanted for murder.

29:33.239 --> 29:34.371
My daughter is missing,

29:34.373 --> 29:37.541
And somehow <i>I'm</i> the one
in the hot seat?

29:37.543 --> 29:39.209
Yeah, that's
how it looks.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.111
Just have some
questions, admiral.

29:41.113 --> 29:42.946
Does it have to do with
finding my daughter?

29:42.948 --> 29:44.181
Gibbs:
It has to do with

29:44.183 --> 29:45.883
Zakaria hassan.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.953
I have no idea who this is.

29:49.955 --> 29:53.056
Vance:
An encrypted message
from your dod log-in

29:53.058 --> 29:54.424
Was found on his laptop.

29:54.426 --> 29:55.526
That's not possible.

29:58.396 --> 29:59.429
You're looking at it, admiral.

29:59.431 --> 30:01.532
And I assure you
I didn't send it.

30:01.534 --> 30:03.934
I told you, I have no idea
who your victim is.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.235
He went to college
with your daughter.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.804
So did 15,000 other people.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.305
He's the only one
murdered last week

30:08.307 --> 30:11.008
With classified intelligence
documents on his laptop.

30:15.413 --> 30:17.915
You're accusing me of espionage.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.517
Security protocols.
Dod ciphers.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.519
Everything you need
to infiltrate

30:22.521 --> 30:24.121
Our intelligence systems.

30:24.123 --> 30:26.356
I am the vice chairman
of the joint chiefs of staff.

30:26.358 --> 30:28.091
This guy's murder
is connected

30:28.093 --> 30:31.929
To your daughter and our
two dead ncis agents-- why?

30:31.931 --> 30:34.164
I told you I have no idea.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.867
And, clearly, neither do you.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.535
My daughter is missing

30:38.537 --> 30:40.370
And you are
on a fishing expedition.

30:40.372 --> 30:43.173
Someone is peddling
classified materials.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.075
Someone was involved
in espionage.

30:45.077 --> 30:46.510
It's your log-in, admiral.

30:46.512 --> 30:48.579
If you didn't
send the e-mail,

30:48.581 --> 30:50.480
Who did?

30:55.920 --> 30:57.487
All right.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.157
(sighs) I don't see any
televisions or newspapers,

31:00.159 --> 31:01.625
So that's good.

31:01.627 --> 31:04.461
It's a quiet place
for us to grab a quick bite.

31:04.463 --> 31:05.996
Can we talk about
marseille?

31:05.998 --> 31:08.131
What's there to talk about?

31:08.133 --> 31:09.533
We're wanted for murder.

31:09.535 --> 31:12.436
Technically,
you're wanted for murder.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.871
They haven't even mentioned me
on the news.

31:13.873 --> 31:16.006
Yeah, I noticed that.
I wonder why.

31:16.975 --> 31:19.109
How 'bout I go back?

31:19.111 --> 31:20.344
No, hear me out,
all right?

31:20.346 --> 31:22.012
I'll get some transportation,

31:22.014 --> 31:23.614
A safe phone,
then I'll come back and get you.

31:23.616 --> 31:25.482
We're going
to Spain.

31:25.484 --> 31:26.617
That's the plan.

31:28.586 --> 31:31.655
Order me some eggs and coffee.
I got to hit the head.

31:44.469 --> 31:47.204
Oh, god,
I was just going outside.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.207
Why are you gunning-- no--
to go back to marseille?

31:50.209 --> 31:53.510
I was just going...
Shh!

31:56.281 --> 31:58.448
Bonjour.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.285
Uh, <i>deux petits dÃ©jeuners,</i>
<i>s'il vous plaÃ®t.</i>

32:01.287 --> 32:03.086
Avec, uh, cafÃ©.

32:03.088 --> 32:04.154
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

32:07.158 --> 32:08.425
Get off of me.

32:11.362 --> 32:13.597
What are you doing?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.299
Oh, what do we have here?

32:15.301 --> 32:16.400
Ooh, la, la.

32:18.202 --> 32:21.138
And matches are missing.
I didn't know you smoked.

32:21.140 --> 32:24.341
I don't...
You started the fire
on the bus.

32:24.343 --> 32:26.343
I know.

32:26.345 --> 32:29.546
Why are you so hell-bent
on not getting out of France?

32:29.548 --> 32:31.548
I swear to you...
Don't swear...

32:31.550 --> 32:33.684
Don't pretend and don't promise.

32:33.686 --> 32:36.553
Tell me the truth.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.121
What is going on?
What are you into?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.123
Nothing.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.527
I'm a federal agent, amanda.

32:43.529 --> 32:46.630
I know when people
are lying to me.

32:46.632 --> 32:49.733
And that's all
you've been doing.

32:51.269 --> 32:54.438
Okay. Let's try another one.

32:54.440 --> 32:56.440
(sighs)

32:56.442 --> 32:58.976
Zakaria hassan.

32:58.978 --> 33:02.312
That's what the message
from ncis was about.

33:02.314 --> 33:04.047
You went to college with him.

33:04.049 --> 33:07.050
And now he's dead.

33:07.052 --> 33:10.387
Everywhere you go,
people die.

33:10.389 --> 33:14.124
I've been framed for murder and
now we're running for our lives,

33:14.126 --> 33:17.127
But all you care about
is finding amir,

33:17.129 --> 33:21.298
Who happens to be the son
of an iranian cabinet minister.
Tony...

33:21.300 --> 33:24.201
No. You know what I think?

33:24.203 --> 33:26.103
I think you're not some
brain-dead little party girl.

33:26.105 --> 33:30.507
I think that all of this
is an act,

33:30.509 --> 33:33.176
And I think
you are some kind of spy

33:33.178 --> 33:37.014
Working for amir
and the iranian government.

33:39.117 --> 33:41.518
Am I crazy?

33:41.520 --> 33:44.521
Half-crazy, tony.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.623
I am a spy.

33:46.625 --> 33:49.659
But amir works
for me.

33:49.661 --> 33:52.295
And I work
for the same people you do.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.375
I've been a member of
the defense clandestine service

34:05.377 --> 34:07.444
Since I was in college.

34:07.446 --> 34:11.348
Zakaria hassan
recruited me.

34:11.350 --> 34:14.651
He was my handler.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.154
And "navy brat party girl"
was your cover.

34:17.156 --> 34:19.322
Hassan's idea.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.457
What about amir?

34:20.459 --> 34:22.159
Well, I met him 18 months ago.

34:23.127 --> 34:24.327
Oh.

34:24.329 --> 34:25.662
Thank you.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.764
<i>Merci.</i>

34:27.766 --> 34:28.832
Hmph.

34:30.301 --> 34:33.370
Took some time
but I turned him.

34:33.372 --> 34:36.473
He's not a fan
of his nation's politics.

34:36.475 --> 34:38.108
What was he feeding you?

34:38.110 --> 34:39.643
Diplomatic cables from his job

34:39.645 --> 34:41.111
At the iranian consulate.

34:41.113 --> 34:42.646
Low-grade
intel, mostly.

34:42.648 --> 34:45.282
Low-grade intel doesn't get
seven people killed.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.617
A couple of weeks ago, he came
across something different.

34:47.619 --> 34:51.288
Coded files
regarding their wmd program.

34:51.290 --> 34:56.126
Amir was worried that he would
be seen copying these files.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.461
But he did it anyway.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.262
For me.

34:59.264 --> 35:03.500
So I sent them to hassan
and then lost contact.

35:03.502 --> 35:07.304
And I tried every communication
channel I could think of.

35:07.306 --> 35:09.172
The iranians
probably tracked the files,

35:09.174 --> 35:12.509
Found hassan, killed him,
and now they're on to you.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.178
Now you understand?
Yeah.

35:15.180 --> 35:18.515
It's <i>three days of the condor,</i>
<i>except... I'm faye dunaway.</i>

35:18.517 --> 35:21.351
Amir risked his
life for me.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.487
I'm not leaving him behind.

35:23.489 --> 35:26.490
I need to get him out
of marseilles.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.258
Just let dcs get him out.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.660
The mission went south, okay?
And I'm on my own.

35:30.662 --> 35:34.197
Amanda, you're not
on your own, you have me.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.665
And ncis.

35:35.667 --> 35:38.201
We'll get amir out.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.870
(phone rings)

35:39.872 --> 35:41.838
Yeah. Hello.
Tony:
Hey, boss.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.240
Don't have long to talk.

35:43.242 --> 35:44.708
Ah, dinozzo. Where are you?

35:44.710 --> 35:46.910
We're safe. We need your help.

35:46.912 --> 35:48.411
Give me an address.
I'll have you picked up.

35:48.413 --> 35:50.480
(chuckles)
that's not the help we need.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.817
Okay. Go.
Amir askari. Iranian national.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.686
Works at their consulate.
Son of a cabinet minister.

35:56.688 --> 35:58.288
He's somewhere in marseille.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.589
Yeah, and...?

35:59.591 --> 36:01.158
I need you to find him.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.392
Why?

36:02.394 --> 36:04.528
Funny thing.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.662
Can't tell you.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.264
(scoffs)
are you serious?

36:07.266 --> 36:08.798
It's compartmented,

36:08.800 --> 36:10.400
But we need an nsa alpha team

36:10.402 --> 36:13.403
To pinpoint
amir's exact location asap.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.671
I can't authorize an alpha team.

36:14.673 --> 36:16.273
No,

36:16.275 --> 36:17.707
But admiral kendall can.

36:17.709 --> 36:20.610
All right.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.779
All right, I'll make the call.
Where can I reach you?

36:22.781 --> 36:24.314
It's better if I reach you.

36:24.316 --> 36:25.649
Stay safe, tony.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.717
You, too.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.289
Hey, you get all that?

36:32.291 --> 36:33.890
Yeah, we were
monitoring the call.

36:33.892 --> 36:36.893
And we weren't the only ones.
You and tony were right.

36:36.895 --> 36:40.297
Who?
Someone was listening
to the call from inside

36:40.299 --> 36:41.965
Marseille police
headquarters.

36:41.967 --> 36:44.534
From a cell phone
that belongs to...

36:44.536 --> 36:46.736
Inspector isabel cheblis.

36:46.738 --> 36:49.606
The one who framed dinozzo
for murder.

36:49.608 --> 36:52.242
And cheblis's
on the move.

36:52.244 --> 36:54.544
Gibbs:
Track her.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.546
With luck,
she'll lead us right to amir.

36:56.548 --> 36:58.949
Let dinozzo know.
I'll contact him
through symbolese.

36:58.951 --> 37:00.617
I got another call to make.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.290
Amanda:
Stop kicking me.

37:07.292 --> 37:09.659
(tony grunting)

37:12.863 --> 37:16.266
Well, I hope you're, uh,
comfortable up there, miss,

37:16.268 --> 37:19.336
Because... I'm super cozy
back here.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.239
Cheblis's been
in there a while.

37:22.241 --> 37:24.941
Amir has to be inside.
Be patient.

37:24.943 --> 37:27.377
Listen, just... Can you move
your chair up an inch?

37:28.779 --> 37:30.313
Oh. Wait a minute.

37:31.382 --> 37:32.749
Half an inch.

37:37.021 --> 37:38.688
(engine starts)

37:38.690 --> 37:40.357
Okay, she just left.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.025
Alone.

37:42.027 --> 37:44.327
What's the play? Follow?
No.

37:44.329 --> 37:45.428
Abby's tracking her.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.796
We go in.

37:51.369 --> 37:52.502
Come on, let's go.

37:52.504 --> 37:54.971
(grunts) what?
My foot fell asleep.

37:54.973 --> 37:56.373
Stupid car.

37:56.375 --> 37:59.342
(man moaning)
shh.

38:00.378 --> 38:02.946
(moaning continues)
over there.

38:07.585 --> 38:09.052
(moaning)

38:10.454 --> 38:12.455
Oh, my god, amir.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.457
Amanda, thank god. They've been
holding us here since yesterday.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.393
Is he okay?

38:16.395 --> 38:17.994
He's in and out, but I think so.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.396
How many are there?
Two.

38:19.398 --> 38:21.331
The policewoman
and someone else.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.333
Can you help us?
That's the plan.
Let's get out of here.

38:23.335 --> 38:24.868
(coughing)
shh.
It's all right.

38:24.870 --> 38:26.369
It's gonna be
all right.

38:28.039 --> 38:30.073
(grunting)

38:30.075 --> 38:32.342
Get up!

38:32.344 --> 38:34.311
Get up.

38:34.313 --> 38:35.011
Up!

38:38.916 --> 38:39.983
Who's paying you?

38:41.419 --> 38:42.485
That would be me.

38:43.321 --> 38:44.754
Let me guess.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.956
The iranians discovered
that amir was trading secrets,

38:46.958 --> 38:48.658
So they hired you
to kill everybody?

38:48.660 --> 38:50.327
Good guess.
How'd you find out

38:50.329 --> 38:52.395
Zakaria hassan
was amanda's handler?

38:52.397 --> 38:53.363
Does it matter?

38:53.365 --> 38:54.497
Now drop the gun.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.366
Right now there are 12

38:56.368 --> 38:59.402
Of the most highly trained
marksmen in the world

38:59.404 --> 39:01.404
Just waiting to
blow you to pieces.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.641
All they need
is my signal.

39:04.643 --> 39:08.345
I'm debating: Do I want to see
you blown all over the wall?

39:08.347 --> 39:10.347
Or do I want to find out
a little bit more first?

39:10.349 --> 39:11.948
Your call.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.584
You're bluffing.

39:14.586 --> 39:16.486
Am I?

39:43.547 --> 39:45.548
When did you call them?

39:45.550 --> 39:47.684
I didn't.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.519
(chuckles)

39:49.521 --> 39:52.455
But this has leroy jethro
gibbs written all over it.

39:58.729 --> 39:59.896
<i>(elevator bell chimes)</i>

39:59.898 --> 40:01.464
Kendall: ...Just want
to thank you

40:01.466 --> 40:02.565
For what you and ncis

40:02.567 --> 40:03.933
Have done for me
and my family.

40:03.935 --> 40:05.502
I cannot tell you...

40:08.472 --> 40:10.740
Amanda.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.442
Dad.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.511
I'm okay.

40:14.513 --> 40:17.547
(sighs)
good.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.518
We have a lot to discuss.
(chuckles)

40:21.520 --> 40:24.521
I wanted to tell you, dad.
They just...

40:24.523 --> 40:25.555
Wouldn't let me.

40:25.557 --> 40:27.090
I know. I know.

40:27.092 --> 40:28.691
I should have trusted you.

40:28.693 --> 40:30.827
Tony: Don't be so hard
on yourself, sir.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.830
My father and I have
had similar troubles.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.999
It reminds me of this
one winter in jamaica,

40:36.001 --> 40:39.068
Fraught with problems.

40:39.070 --> 40:41.204
I'm sure you have
admiral-daughter stuff

40:41.206 --> 40:42.639
To take care of.

40:43.674 --> 40:44.507
She's terrific.

40:49.046 --> 40:52.081
Hey. They let you out
of France, huh?

40:52.083 --> 40:54.517
Only if I promised not
to come back.

40:54.519 --> 40:56.052
Thanks,
by the way.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.021
I bet state was
pretty pissed off you went

40:58.023 --> 40:59.823
Behind their back,
bringing in interpol.

40:59.825 --> 41:02.459
You do what you got to do.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.461
Amen.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.529
Ah, mr. Palmer.

41:06.531 --> 41:07.564
Nice job.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.732
Hey!
Huh? Huh...?

41:09.734 --> 41:11.468
I'm complimenting you.
Pay attention.

41:11.470 --> 41:12.602
It doesn't happen too often.

41:12.604 --> 41:14.137
Yeah, sorry. Um...

41:14.139 --> 41:16.506
Breena keeps sending me
this message

41:16.508 --> 41:17.774
On symbolese.
I don't think

41:17.776 --> 41:20.109
She understands
how the game works.

41:20.111 --> 41:21.744
(chuckles)

41:21.746 --> 41:24.113
I-I think she's
saying that...

41:24.115 --> 41:27.484
She's got something
baking for you, jim.

41:27.486 --> 41:30.119
No, no. Breena's more of a cook
than a baker.

41:30.121 --> 41:32.555
And, plus, I'm not
doing gluten right now, so I...
Palmer.

41:33.624 --> 41:35.925
That's a bun.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.894
That's an oven.

41:37.896 --> 41:39.529
Do the math.

41:39.531 --> 41:40.864
Oh.

41:43.634 --> 41:45.835
Oh...!
