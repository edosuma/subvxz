THIS STORY IS INSPIRED
BY REAL EVENTS

00:25.417 --> 00:28.042
SOME CHARACTERS AND SITUATIONS
HAVE BEEN FICTIONALIZED

00:28.625 --> 00:31.292
IN MEMORY OF PEDRO COSTA

01:06.417 --> 01:09.875
<i>The first time I heard of Baler,
I was 20.</i>

01:11.542 --> 01:14.125
<i>I was told it was a Tagalog town,</i>

01:14.292 --> 01:15.750
<i>north of Manila,</i>

01:16.875 --> 01:20.667
<i>an accursed place
surrounded by sea and jungle,</i>

01:21.208 --> 01:24.583
<i>inhabited by bloodthirsty rebels
who hated Spain.</i>

01:29.250 --> 01:31.083
<i>One night,</i>

01:31.250 --> 01:33.958
<i>in October 1897,</i>

01:35.208 --> 01:39.083
<i>a detachment defending the town
was massacred without mercy.</i>

01:49.417 --> 01:50.792
<i>There was terror,"...</i>

01:52.000 --> 01:53.667
Lieutenant!

01:54.958 --> 01:56.417
<i>Despair,</i>

01:59.208 --> 02:00.250
<i>chaos...</i>

02:11.708 --> 02:13.417
<i>It was shameful.</i>

02:16.125 --> 02:19.417
<i>Of fifty soldiers,
only thirteen survived.</i>

02:27.042 --> 02:29.250
<i>They fought for their freedom,</i>

02:31.333 --> 02:33.708
<i>we fought for
the survival of an empire.</i>

02:48.000 --> 02:49.333
<i>And we lost.</i>

03:35.500 --> 03:38.375
<i>Three months later,
I was sent with the next group.</i>

03:40.167 --> 03:42.750
<i>Our mission was to recover
this accursed town,</i>

03:43.792 --> 03:45.458
<i>and the grandeur of Spain.</i>

03:47.333 --> 03:49.042
<i>I didn't know it yet,</i>

03:49.208 --> 03:52.625
but we were destined to be
the last defenders of the Empire,

03:55.000 --> 03:57.292
<i>the last ones on the Philippines.</i>

03:57.458 --> 04:02.250
1998, OUR LAST MEN IN THE PHILIPPINES

04:28.583 --> 04:30.292
<i>I'd never been in a war...</i>

04:31.625 --> 04:33.125
<i>and I thought that, to survive,</i>

04:33.292 --> 04:35.875
<i>I just needed a little luck</i>

04:36.042 --> 04:37.500
<i>and common SENSE.</i>

04:41.375 --> 04:42.667
<i>I was young.</i>

04:45.458 --> 04:47.500
<i>I was naive.</i>

05:03.042 --> 05:05.375
- You can't see anyone.
- Lt's what they do best:

05:05.542 --> 05:07.708
hide, kill, hide...

05:07.875 --> 05:10.875
That'll do, "Ron",
you'll get a belly ache.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.625
Keep your eyes peeled.

05:16.875 --> 05:20.167
Away all boats, arms ready!

05:20.333 --> 05:22.208
Let's go, men!

05:22.375 --> 05:24.958
- Away all boats!
- Come on, hurry up!

05:25.208 --> 05:27.042
God help us.

05:27.208 --> 05:30.208
- Come on, go!
- How did I get into this? Damn it!

05:34.250 --> 05:37.458
Lieutenant, there's a man
on the shore!

06:16.083 --> 06:18.167
Lieutenant Martin Cerezo,
2nd Ranger Battalion.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.875
Brother Carmelo,
I look after the parish.

06:21.042 --> 06:22.458
Do you command these men?

06:22.917 --> 06:24.792
That's Captain Las Morenas.
He's coming.

06:24.958 --> 06:27.542
- Have you come from Manila?
- Yes, Father.

06:27.708 --> 06:29.208
To recover the town.

06:29.375 --> 06:32.208
- Where's the best access?
- An hour upriver.

06:32.375 --> 06:33.917
The rebels left two weeks ago...

06:34.083 --> 06:35.125
Fix bayonets!

06:36.208 --> 06:38.708
The remaining natives are peaceful.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.542
Let me be the judge of that.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.917
We advance in two columns.
Carvajal, on point.

06:45.792 --> 06:47.708
Everyone on the alert. Move!

06:47.875 --> 06:49.792
Unfurl the flag and come with me.

09:14.833 --> 09:17.917
Luis, take five men
and check the church.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.167
On me!

09:19.667 --> 09:21.625
How thick are these walls?

09:21.792 --> 09:23.958
Almost five feet.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.958
Five feet can take the impact
of heavy artillery.

09:27.125 --> 09:30.458
Apart from the sacristy,
what else can we use for storage?

09:37.875 --> 09:39.458
Sergeant Jimeno Costa.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.292
I'm a survivor
of the previous detachment.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.625
At your orders, Lieutenant.

09:50.208 --> 09:52.208
I've been waiting for you for weeks.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.500
Regulations say you should've gone
with your men to Manila.

09:59.917 --> 10:02.375
The first duty of a soldier,
Lieutenant,

10:03.417 --> 10:06.458
- is to defend Spain.
- You didn't do that too well.

10:06.625 --> 10:10.333
I didn't surrender, God knows
I fought until I had no strength left.

10:11.625 --> 10:15.292
Isn't this enough for you,
or this?

10:22.542 --> 10:24.458
If the Tagalog come down again,

10:25.583 --> 10:27.542
you're going to need me.

10:28.042 --> 10:29.500
I know what's going on here.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.333
Why didn't you take down that flag?

10:31.500 --> 10:33.875
They cut ours to pieces.

10:34.917 --> 10:37.083
And the townspeople want this one.

10:37.833 --> 10:38.875
Jose.

10:43.292 --> 10:45.417
Hoist it.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.958
Keeping it as a souvenir?

11:07.125 --> 11:10.583
Be careful of the women
in the town, Lieutenant.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.833
They all spy for the enemy.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.458
- What's your name?
- Teresa.

11:16.625 --> 11:19.875
She's a whore,
her brother fights with the rebels.

11:20.042 --> 11:22.667
What my brother does
is his business.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.917
I've got nothing against Spain.

11:27.292 --> 11:28.917
I'm baptized

11:29.083 --> 11:31.750
and I sing in the church choir.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.917
What do you sing?
Christmas carols?

11:38.417 --> 11:39.958
Love songs.

11:41.000 --> 11:42.375
Whatever you like.

11:44.292 --> 11:45.792
What songs do you know?

11:47.083 --> 11:49.958
Spanish, Filipino...

11:50.750 --> 11:51.833
Sing one.

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
- I sing when I get paid.
- Like all whores.

12:14.125 --> 12:22.125
<i>I will tell you...</i>

12:26.417 --> 12:27.417
Go on.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.917
That's all you paid for.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.667
Welcome to Baler...

12:34.458 --> 12:35.667
sir.

12:48.917 --> 12:51.625
The rebels belong
to a Masonic organization,

12:51.792 --> 12:55.917
the Katipunan, that seeks
an independent Philippines.

12:56.083 --> 12:58.875
They don't care that Spain
has been here for 400 years,

12:59.042 --> 13:02.417
that we've built its cities.
They want us out, and dead.

13:03.292 --> 13:05.500
The Tagalog are tough,

13:05.792 --> 13:08.542
they're very violent,
and they have great allies:

13:09.917 --> 13:12.333
the heat, malaria,

13:13.333 --> 13:16.250
typhoons and beasts.

13:19.417 --> 13:23.000
You're very young, very green,

13:24.167 --> 13:25.250
and inept

13:27.208 --> 13:29.750
If you want to survive,

13:30.792 --> 13:32.583
you'll have to learn fast.

13:34.542 --> 13:37.917
Whoever doesn't,
God have mercy on him.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.167
We'll survive.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.833
This little Virgin is lucky.

14:05.000 --> 14:08.542
Lucky for everyone, or just you?

14:08.708 --> 14:10.917
If you want to trust in the Virgin,
it's up to you,

14:11.083 --> 14:13.667
but the men butchered here
had crucifixes too.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.000
They died for Spain.

14:16.167 --> 14:19.708
For Spain...
What's Spain done for you?

14:21.458 --> 14:22.917
I'm not here by choice.

14:23.083 --> 14:26.792
When why the hell
are you here, Juan?

14:59.625 --> 15:01.250
Aim!

15:02.458 --> 15:03.458
Fire!

15:04.083 --> 15:05.625
Ready!

15:05.958 --> 15:06.958
Fire!

15:08.417 --> 15:11.542
- Cease fire. Weapons down.
- Are they really this bad?

15:11.708 --> 15:13.542
It's the first time
they've fired a gun.

15:14.583 --> 15:16.250
My God.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.417
You've said it my captain,
they'll have to learn.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.542
I don't know if they'll have time.

15:20.708 --> 15:22.625
Then we'll need to dig
a lot of graves.

15:22.792 --> 15:25.375
I'm not making my wife a widow.

15:25.542 --> 15:26.375
Aim!

15:26.542 --> 15:28.208
I know yours died recently.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.417
Fire!

15:29.583 --> 15:33.167
I lost my daughter too.
Three days old. Tuberculosis.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.750
- My condolences.
- Fire!

15:35.917 --> 15:37.750
Why didn't you stay in Spain?

15:39.583 --> 15:42.083
It's the last place I wanted to be.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.833
Fire!

15:44.792 --> 15:46.667
You didn't come to sacrifice yourself?

15:48.875 --> 15:51.833
Look, Lieutenant, in war
there are two types of soldier:

15:52.000 --> 15:54.417
those who want medals
and those who want to get home.

15:54.833 --> 15:57.125
Given the choice,
I'd prefer the former.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.333
They're the most dangerous.

16:02.500 --> 16:04.417
Put your heart into it!

16:06.167 --> 16:09.333
A circle around me! Let's go!

16:09.500 --> 16:11.917
- In a circle!
- Keep your distance!

16:23.042 --> 16:25.250
They didn't even get your
boot size right, eh?

16:27.625 --> 16:30.417
They send you here
without knowing how to shoot,

16:30.583 --> 16:33.917
- with boots the wrong size...
<i>- I’ll</i> adapt, Lieutenant.

16:34.083 --> 16:35.542
Is your morale that high?

16:36.583 --> 16:39.542
If I get back from the war
with an exemplary conduct letter,

16:39.750 --> 16:41.833
I can study at
the Royal Academy.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.125
- Study what?
- Painting, Lieutenant.

16:44.292 --> 16:47.625
I want to be a painter.
Don Gabriel says I'm good.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.167
- Who's Don Gabriel?
- The mayor of my hometown.

16:50.333 --> 16:53.875
He promised to pay for my studies
if I make it back with that letter.

16:54.042 --> 16:56.542
He should've paid
the 2,000 pesetas

16:56.708 --> 16:59.458
- to get you out of the Army.
- Don Gabriel is a patriot.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.667
- He says that Spain needs...
- Spain is full of patriots like him.

17:02.833 --> 17:05.791
They send off other men
while they stuff themselves.

17:08.666 --> 17:10.375
The aim is restore

17:10.541 --> 17:13.708
the original tone and brightness

17:13.875 --> 17:16.208
and emphasize their contour.

17:18.791 --> 17:19.833
Look.

17:22.291 --> 17:23.333
You see?

17:25.125 --> 17:29.000
- And you want me to do it?
- Well, I saw your drawings.

17:29.167 --> 17:31.687
And the lieutenant tells me
you want to devote yourself to this.

17:31.833 --> 17:32.958
It's an opportunity.

17:33.125 --> 17:36.583
I don't know, Father, I haven't
had much practice with brushes.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.875
- I don't want to desecrate...
- Desecrate?

17:39.542 --> 17:42.542
I've been a missionary
around the world for 20 years.

17:42.708 --> 17:45.458
If I only did
what the seminary taught, I'd be dead.

17:47.708 --> 17:48.833
Son,

17:49.875 --> 17:54.042
the natives like to be told stories.

17:54.208 --> 17:55.375
I'm just asking you

17:55.542 --> 17:58.667
to make them more attractive.

17:58.833 --> 18:02.042
And I needn't tell you
that while you're on this job

18:02.208 --> 18:04.750
you'll be off guard duty
or anything else.

18:05.708 --> 18:09.167
<i>Where God is in charge,
no captain is.</i>

18:10.417 --> 18:12.375
Rifles up close!

18:12.625 --> 18:15.292
Present... arms!

18:16.542 --> 18:19.167
Order... arms!

18:20.208 --> 18:22.083
Head up! With pride!

18:27.042 --> 18:29.000
Who taught you to paint like that?

18:29.167 --> 18:32.125
I learnt with limestone and clay.
While Grandpa herded,

18:32.292 --> 18:35.292
I'd amuse myself by drawing.

18:35.458 --> 18:36.750
Where are you from?

18:38.042 --> 18:41.208
Fuenlabrada de Los Montes,
in Extremadura.

18:43.125 --> 18:46.375
Son, I think you were born
in the wrong place.

19:18.458 --> 19:20.000
Crocodiles.

19:20.167 --> 19:21.167
Sergeant.

19:24.083 --> 19:26.583
Sometimes they get dogs, cats,

19:27.125 --> 19:29.208
whatever they can find.

19:30.292 --> 19:32.958
I wish they'd eat the captain's dog.

19:35.042 --> 19:37.917
How the hell can you
come to war with a dog?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.583
Don't you ever rest?

19:46.208 --> 19:50.042
No. They've captured me once before.

19:50.208 --> 19:52.292
It's not going to happen again.

19:54.208 --> 19:55.833
Is this your first war?

19:58.125 --> 20:00.708
Watch out it doesn't become a vice.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.542
What?

20:04.458 --> 20:05.500
Killing.

20:11.875 --> 20:13.000
Hold still!

20:14.708 --> 20:15.708
Hold still!

20:16.833 --> 20:19.833
We caught her heading for
the hills with food.

20:22.792 --> 20:23.792
Let her go.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.208
Sergeant...

20:27.375 --> 20:29.125
What do you think?

20:29.292 --> 20:31.417
What the hell do you think?

20:32.125 --> 20:34.458
She only hauls food?

20:34.625 --> 20:36.042
This bitch knows where you sleep,

20:36.208 --> 20:39.417
what you eat, what you shit!

20:39.583 --> 20:43.083
She want to fuck us up
and nobody's doing that to me!

21:04.083 --> 21:05.583
It's for your brother.

21:06.542 --> 21:10.083
It's just food, I have nothing
to do with this war.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.875
You do now.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.500
Go on, go.

21:14.667 --> 21:15.792
- Sergeant...
- Lieutenant!

21:15.958 --> 21:17.083
Let her go.

21:21.958 --> 21:23.708
If you want to
join your people, do it.

21:25.708 --> 21:28.083
But give your brother a message:

21:28.250 --> 21:31.542
If they come back to Baler,
we'll be waiting,

21:32.375 --> 21:34.500
and this time
there'll be no surrender.

21:48.667 --> 21:50.750
It's a mistake to let her go.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.708
It's a sign of weakness.

21:52.958 --> 21:55.333
Do you know what is
a sign of weakness?

21:57.250 --> 21:58.833
Killing women.

22:07.167 --> 22:08.250
Halt!

22:11.042 --> 22:12.125
- Don't shoot!
- Halt!

22:12.292 --> 22:14.875
- It's Spanish mail!
- Keep a lookout!

22:15.667 --> 22:16.958
Help me, help me.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.417
He's in bad shape.

22:23.708 --> 22:25.542
The Americans declared war on us.

22:25.708 --> 22:26.750
What?

22:27.792 --> 22:29.917
They're accusing us of sinking
some ship in Havana.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.917
Their fleet has destroyed
the Spanish fleet in Cavite.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.500
What about Manila?

22:34.667 --> 22:35.792
Under siege.

22:40.167 --> 22:42.292
Did you cross the Sierra Madre?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.458
The Tagalog...

22:44.625 --> 22:46.958
The Tagalog attacked you?
How many were there?

22:48.417 --> 22:50.042
- 50.
- How many did you see?

22:51.167 --> 22:53.167
Out! Everyone out, please!

22:54.542 --> 22:56.125
Hold him. Lift him up.

23:18.042 --> 23:20.500
Gentlemen, Manila HQ

23:20.667 --> 23:22.625
will not be able to send us supplies.

23:23.708 --> 23:26.375
That cuts us off
from the rest of the country.

23:26.542 --> 23:29.875
From now on
we rely on ourselves.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.750
The rebels are up there waiting for
the right time to come down.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.000
There are fifty of us

23:35.167 --> 23:37.917
and they could number
a hundred, two hundred,

23:38.083 --> 23:39.208
even a thousand.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.875
To avoid any surprises,
I've made a decision.

23:42.917 --> 23:45.458
We'll turn the church into a fortress

23:45.625 --> 23:48.500
<i>and take refuge inside.</i>

23:48.917 --> 23:51.917
<i>We'll confiscate animals for reserves
in the event of a siege.</i>

23:52.083 --> 23:54.500
Bermúdez, occupy the corral.
Eduardo, take three men

23:54.667 --> 23:56.958
and search that cabin.
The rest of you, on me.

23:57.125 --> 24:00.458
Someone told them
to leave here, Sergeant.

24:00.625 --> 24:03.292
<i>We'll use the church courtyard
as a garden</i>

24:03.625 --> 24:06.292
<i>and we'll dig a well
for fresh water.</i>

24:09.542 --> 24:12.167
<i>The sacristy
will be our infirmary...</i>

24:14.375 --> 24:16.250
<i>and the basement our storeroom.</i>

24:21.542 --> 24:22.917
The last one?

24:24.792 --> 24:28.500
<i>We'll raise the Spanish flag
high on the bell tower.</i>

24:32.833 --> 24:36.833
<i>Gentlemen,</i> we <i>can't tell you
what's happening in Manila,</i>

24:37.000 --> 24:39.500
<i>San Juan or Havana,</i>

24:39.667 --> 24:42.208
<i>but I can tell you
what we're going to do here.</i>

24:43.792 --> 24:46.000
<i>- We're going to fight.
- Hurrah for Spain!</i>

24:46.167 --> 24:47.542
<i>Hurrah!</i>

25:01.708 --> 25:05.333
JUNE 30, 1898

25:41.542 --> 25:42.542
Who goes there?!

25:45.583 --> 25:46.833
Who goes there?!

25:56.542 --> 26:00.250
The Tagalog are attacking!
They're attacking!

26:00.417 --> 26:01.500
Fire!

26:03.292 --> 26:04.458
Come out!

26:04.625 --> 26:06.458
Go, quickly!

26:06.625 --> 26:09.458
To the trench!
Keep them back from the church!

26:09.625 --> 26:11.125
Vigil, take the courtyard.

26:11.292 --> 26:14.542
Carvajal, take your two best shots
up to the choir level.

26:14.708 --> 26:17.167
- Positions at the windows. Go!
- Yes, sir.

26:17.333 --> 26:19.208
Everyone to the trenches!

26:19.750 --> 26:21.250
Quickly!

26:24.167 --> 26:26.792
Go, fire! Fire!

26:27.583 --> 26:31.167
Fire at will!
Everyone in position!

26:31.333 --> 26:32.333
Go!

26:33.583 --> 26:36.542
To the trench! Take cover!

26:37.792 --> 26:40.000
Go, go, go!

26:49.000 --> 26:50.000
Fire!

26:55.542 --> 26:56.542
Fire!

26:58.333 --> 27:00.083
Don't let them get close!

27:06.500 --> 27:07.708
Andrés.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.667
Good God... Fire at will!

27:23.958 --> 27:25.417
Fix bayonets!!

27:29.750 --> 27:31.375
Keep firing!

27:41.792 --> 27:44.042
Get up! Fuck!

28:01.000 --> 28:03.667
Lieutenant!
Fall back from the trench!

28:04.083 --> 28:06.208
- Captain...
- Sound retreat!

28:08.250 --> 28:10.208
Jimeno! Fall back!

28:11.417 --> 28:14.708
Back! Fall back!

28:15.625 --> 28:17.125
Cease fire! Retreat!

28:19.083 --> 28:20.125
Retreat?

28:21.333 --> 28:23.250
You don't win wars that way.

28:23.417 --> 28:24.958
Go!

28:33.417 --> 28:35.875
They're here!

28:38.500 --> 28:40.667
Up! Let's go!

28:42.208 --> 28:45.292
Let's

29:49.917 --> 29:52.417
They outnumbered us, Carlos.
There were thousands of them.

29:52.583 --> 29:53.833
That's not true.

29:55.167 --> 29:56.708
It isn't?

29:56.875 --> 29:58.708
There weren't thousands,
don't exaggerate.

29:59.792 --> 30:01.750
Where the hell were you?

30:01.917 --> 30:03.458
Fighting, just like you.

30:03.958 --> 30:05.708
Are you calling me a liar?

30:06.833 --> 30:08.417
Are you calling me a liar?

30:08.583 --> 30:09.792
Soldiers!

30:09.958 --> 30:11.042
What are you doing?

30:12.792 --> 30:13.792
Right...

30:13.958 --> 30:15.458
Can you follow this finger?

30:17.333 --> 30:19.958
You were up top.
Tell him how many there were.

30:21.458 --> 30:25.125
Thousands, coming from
everywhere, like cockroaches.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.625
That's not the worst thing.
The worst thing is that we're alone.

30:29.792 --> 30:31.833
Manila's not sending anyone.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.167
We've got the food and ammo
to hold on.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.708
We're fifty scared shitless men
in a church.

30:38.875 --> 30:40.083
Scared shitless?

30:42.333 --> 30:45.292
One battle and you're already
bawling like little girls?

30:45.458 --> 30:46.458
Captain!

30:47.917 --> 30:49.167
Captain!

30:50.042 --> 30:51.667
Go ahead.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.417
They're sending an emissary.

31:00.167 --> 31:02.625
Lieutenant, see what they want.

31:07.042 --> 31:09.167
Moisés, your Mauser.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.167
Carvajal, upstairs.
You come with me.

31:56.167 --> 31:59.750
Calixto Villacorta,
for Commander Luna Novicio,

31:59.917 --> 32:02.833
head of the Filipino forces
in the Katipunan region.

32:03.958 --> 32:06.458
Lieutenant Martin Cerezo,
2nd Ranger Battalion.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.500
My commander
wants no more bloodshed.

32:10.375 --> 32:12.542
Spanish troops are losing everywhere.

32:12.708 --> 32:16.708
Tell him to hand in his arms
and accept Spanish jurisdiction.

32:17.667 --> 32:19.625
You're losing the war.

32:19.792 --> 32:22.875
I see more of your dead
than I do mine.

32:30.208 --> 32:32.250
I should speak to your superior.

32:35.667 --> 32:37.417
There's nothing to say.

32:41.708 --> 32:43.750
We'll grant you
a truce until tomorrow.

32:45.250 --> 32:47.542
Each side can bury their own.

33:04.750 --> 33:06.458
See to the dead.

33:16.042 --> 33:17.458
Well?

33:17.625 --> 33:19.500
They want us to lay down our arms.

33:20.917 --> 33:22.542
There was no offer?

33:24.583 --> 33:27.625
We're in no condition
to receive offers, Captain.

33:53.250 --> 33:55.708
Don't look too hard,
we'll all end up like this.

33:56.583 --> 33:57.833
Shut up.

34:02.583 --> 34:03.917
Juan, help me.

34:32.167 --> 34:34.208
Leave him, I'll do it.

34:35.625 --> 34:36.708
Hold tight.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.750
He's gone putrid!
We have to pull him out.

34:49.792 --> 34:51.958
Shouldn't we just
cover him with earth?

34:52.125 --> 34:54.125
- Would you want to be left here?
- Let's go!

35:12.792 --> 35:13.875
Juan!

35:15.542 --> 35:17.708
Give me a hand.

35:20.875 --> 35:22.000
Juan...

35:37.750 --> 35:39.750
What the hell's he doing?

35:40.667 --> 35:43.000
He's deserting.

35:46.375 --> 35:47.917
Juan!

35:48.083 --> 35:49.958
Juan!

35:53.792 --> 35:55.958
What are you waiting for? Shoot!

35:59.417 --> 36:02.125
Shoot! That's an order!

36:04.083 --> 36:05.417
<i>Shoo“</i>

36:21.250 --> 36:23.667
We bid farewell
to these war heroes,

36:23.833 --> 36:26.208
<i>with eternal thanks
for their endeavor.</i>

36:26.375 --> 36:29.333
May God reward them

36:29.500 --> 36:31.542
when He receives them in Heaven.

36:31.708 --> 36:33.750
May his Holiness hold him in glory

36:33.917 --> 36:36.167
and may he be forever in our hearts.
Amen.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.542
Amen.

37:02.333 --> 37:06.083
Bad times are coming,
and we have to be ready.

37:12.167 --> 37:13.500
This...

37:13.667 --> 37:16.917
will help us keep hunger
and despair at bay.

37:19.833 --> 37:21.000
What is it?

37:22.375 --> 37:23.708
Opium.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.333
There's not enough for everyone,
but we can share it.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.667
Have you ever tried it?

37:31.625 --> 37:33.125
Before the Philippines

37:33.292 --> 37:36.917
I was spreading the gospel
in the south of China.

37:37.083 --> 37:39.333
There they give their lives
for this stuff,

37:39.500 --> 37:42.208
men get addicted, lose their teeth,

37:42.375 --> 37:44.500
women their dignity...

37:45.542 --> 37:47.667
but it also relieves pain.

37:48.875 --> 37:49.875
What pain?

37:53.792 --> 37:54.917
All pain.

37:57.417 --> 37:59.458
If God wants me to keep working,

37:59.875 --> 38:02.250
and I believe he does,

38:02.417 --> 38:04.125
I need to be strong.

38:06.583 --> 38:07.792
You do too.

38:09.292 --> 38:10.417
Me?

38:12.292 --> 38:13.500
Go on, smoke.

38:15.125 --> 38:16.208
Smoke.

38:40.958 --> 38:43.417
Most Spaniards can't read,

38:44.458 --> 38:46.875
but they know that
Cortez conquered Mexico,

38:47.042 --> 38:50.458
and they know it from
paintings, prints, drawings...

38:52.125 --> 38:53.958
What's this got to do with Mexico?

38:54.125 --> 38:57.583
Son, an empire was born there,

38:57.750 --> 39:00.083
and here we may be burying it.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.875
Don't say that, Father.

39:02.042 --> 39:03.500
What I say doesn't matter.

39:04.333 --> 39:06.375
It's for the Lord to decide.

39:06.542 --> 39:07.750
If that happens,

39:08.958 --> 39:10.250
it'll be a disaster.

39:10.417 --> 39:13.708
Yes, but someone
will have to paint it.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.250
What are you doing there?

39:51.375 --> 39:54.917
Stop listening! The bastards
are playing tricks on us!

39:55.083 --> 39:57.792
Anyone not on guard,
back inside the church.

39:57.958 --> 39:59.125
Go!

40:09.167 --> 40:12.208
<i>Because...</i>

40:12.375 --> 40:15.708
<i>my Song”</i>

40:21.208 --> 40:23.750
Sons of bitches!

40:32.417 --> 40:34.375
Long live Spain, damn it!

40:34.542 --> 40:36.500
Long live the Philippines!

40:38.333 --> 40:41.417
<i>I need your laughter,</i>

40:41.583 --> 40:43.667
<i>I</i> need <i>your</i> kisses,

40:44.917 --> 40:49.833
<i>I need your spark.</i>

40:50.792 --> 40:53.333
<i>I need your laughter,</i>

40:54.750 --> 40:57.583
<i>I</i> need <i>your</i> kisses,

40:59.333 --> 41:01.042
<i>I need...</i>

41:02.583 --> 41:06.583
<i>your spark.</i>

41:19.125 --> 41:21.958
OCTOBER 10, 1898

41:22.125 --> 41:25.333
THREE MONTHS OF SIEGE

42:16.500 --> 42:17.792
Here, "Ron".

42:21.917 --> 42:23.292
Where are you, "Ron"?

42:26.458 --> 42:27.500
"Ron".

42:28.750 --> 42:30.792
"Ron".

42:32.500 --> 42:34.500
We should sacrifice
the captain's dog.

42:39.458 --> 42:40.578
Don't you think, Lieutenant?

42:40.708 --> 42:44.000
- Not much protein.
- Right, but it's something.

42:45.333 --> 42:49.333
The sacks we had to throw away
were his responsibility.

42:51.042 --> 42:53.958
I bet in Manila he took more care
about his dog biscuits

42:54.125 --> 42:57.292
- than our food.
- Watch your mouth, Sergeant.

42:57.458 --> 43:00.708
Lieutenant, the captain...

43:00.875 --> 43:03.708
isn't like us. You know it.

43:03.875 --> 43:05.292
What do I know?

43:30.750 --> 43:31.875
Lieutenant...

43:33.375 --> 43:36.708
I've got no room,
put him there till there's a bed.

43:38.458 --> 43:41.708
Give him water with sugar
to hydrate him. Here.

43:46.375 --> 43:49.708
No, small sips,
so his stomach doesn't reject it.

44:03.333 --> 44:04.458
Lieutenant...

44:06.333 --> 44:07.667
What's happening?

44:09.500 --> 44:11.000
It's the food,

44:11.167 --> 44:13.708
the sacks from Manila
were contaminated.

44:15.917 --> 44:18.042
We're going to be like this
the whole time?

44:18.792 --> 44:20.083
No. We'll get worse.

44:22.875 --> 44:24.167
Look...

44:30.125 --> 44:31.500
What's he got?

44:31.667 --> 44:32.958
It's called beriberi.

44:33.375 --> 44:35.958
The body becomes malnourished,
it lacks minerals...

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
It starts in the legs,
but slowly affects the heart,

44:40.167 --> 44:42.125
the head...

44:43.375 --> 44:44.792
Beriberi?

44:44.958 --> 44:47.750
It means "I can't" in Sinhalese.

44:47.917 --> 44:50.833
I can't walk, I can't speak,
sleep, eat...

44:52.750 --> 44:57.167
It gradually paralyzes the body,
and finally the mind.

45:01.083 --> 45:03.125
And how is it cured?

45:03.292 --> 45:05.708
With fruit, meat, offal,

45:07.250 --> 45:08.833
just what we don't have.

45:19.625 --> 45:21.375
They tricked you, God damn it!

45:22.417 --> 45:24.958
Your superiors are lying to you!

45:25.125 --> 45:26.833
Spain's not at war anymore.

45:27.708 --> 45:31.125
We lost sovereignty
three months ago.

45:31.292 --> 45:32.708
Three months now!

45:34.292 --> 45:36.500
- Private.
- We sold the Philippines to the Americans!

45:36.667 --> 45:38.958
- Private!
- Now they fight against them...

45:39.125 --> 45:39.792
Captain.

45:40.125 --> 45:41.208
Come down.

45:57.625 --> 46:00.292
That fool's been saying that
for days, hasn't he?

46:09.042 --> 46:10.458
Are you alright, Captain?

46:19.292 --> 46:21.375
Lieutenant Martin told me

46:22.417 --> 46:24.500
you want to study Fine Arts,

46:26.417 --> 46:29.458
and you need a letter
of recommendation.

46:29.625 --> 46:30.917
I have a mission.

46:32.375 --> 46:34.208
A mission?

46:34.375 --> 46:37.000
The one with the courage
to carry it out

46:37.167 --> 46:39.167
will leave here with medals,
I assure you.

46:43.708 --> 46:44.708
Manila.

46:47.375 --> 46:48.667
Manila?

46:48.833 --> 46:50.667
We need to get to Manila.

46:51.750 --> 46:55.417
It's the only way to find out
what's actually going on.

46:56.458 --> 46:58.333
You have strong legs
and you're smart.

46:59.417 --> 47:02.125
You could cross the Sierra Madre,
reach Manila,

47:02.292 --> 47:04.167
and be back in a fortnight.

47:10.500 --> 47:12.458
I'm asking you, please.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.458
I’m sleepy-

47:20.833 --> 47:21.917
Are you scared?

47:22.083 --> 47:24.958
It's 200 kilometers.

47:26.708 --> 47:28.750
You have to get through the jungle.

47:29.792 --> 47:31.917
Don't think about that.

47:32.083 --> 47:34.667
Only God knows
what's going to happen.

47:36.708 --> 47:39.208
But I have to figure out
how to do it.

47:40.250 --> 47:41.375
You're wrong.

47:42.417 --> 47:45.083
Thinking weakens you,

47:45.250 --> 47:47.125
and your body.

47:47.292 --> 47:50.875
Thinking... weakens me?

47:52.167 --> 47:53.833
Most of us

47:54.000 --> 47:56.500
suffer over and fear things

47:57.542 --> 47:59.917
that might not ever happen,

48:01.375 --> 48:04.667
things that are only in our heads.

48:06.542 --> 48:09.458
<i>Your fear is all in your head.</i>

48:43.292 --> 48:44.458
Something wrong?

49:16.042 --> 49:18.167
Captain, what's going on?

49:28.458 --> 49:31.125
MY (109, my dog.

49:35.083 --> 49:36.875
Captain...

49:50.625 --> 49:52.792
Who are you?

49:57.208 --> 49:58.250
Vigil!

49:59.917 --> 50:01.083
Vigil!

50:01.250 --> 50:03.917
Call Vigil, quickly! Quickly!

50:04.083 --> 50:06.667
Lieutenant, Lieutenant!

50:16.125 --> 50:18.292
Help me.

50:21.333 --> 50:23.083
Captain, can you hear me?

50:24.667 --> 50:25.792
Enrique.

50:26.542 --> 50:28.500
Enrique!

50:38.208 --> 50:39.833
- Ave Maria...
- What is it?

50:40.875 --> 50:43.250
He vomited black and collapsed.

50:52.125 --> 50:54.375
You'll have to take over, Lieutenant.

51:02.958 --> 51:05.417
Lord, we commend the soul
of your servant

51:05.583 --> 51:08.292
so that, dead to the world,
he is alive to you,

51:08.458 --> 51:11.833
and the sins that through
human frailty he committed,

51:12.000 --> 51:14.458
wash them away with your mercy.

51:14.625 --> 51:16.042
Through Jesus Christ, Our Lord.

51:16.208 --> 51:17.333
Amen.

51:35.917 --> 51:37.917
Since the captain
was sending me to Manila...

51:38.083 --> 51:41.083
The captain's dead.
I'm in charge now.

51:41.250 --> 51:43.083
Of course, Lieutenant,
I was just asking...

51:43.250 --> 51:45.083
Going to Manila is suicide.

51:45.708 --> 51:47.508
They'd have killed you
as soon as you got out.

51:49.125 --> 51:52.250
And I can't lose any more men.

51:52.417 --> 51:54.708
Anything else?

51:55.500 --> 51:56.708
No, Lieutenant.

51:57.917 --> 51:59.333
With your permission...

52:30.667 --> 52:33.792
The heart, liver and offal
are for the sick.

52:33.958 --> 52:36.583
The rest will make a soup
for the others.

52:36.750 --> 52:38.292
Yes, Lieutenant.

52:50.708 --> 52:52.083
It won't go around.

52:53.417 --> 52:56.375
There are too many of us.

52:56.542 --> 52:58.042
Don't think about that.

52:59.667 --> 53:01.250
Thinking makes you weak.

53:13.833 --> 53:16.083
I don't want to be buried here.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.667
No one's going to bury you.

53:18.833 --> 53:21.083
I've seen them being taken away.

53:21.250 --> 53:22.792
Take it easy, son.

53:22.958 --> 53:26.333
Death doesn't take anyone
without God's permission.

53:27.083 --> 53:29.042
And where's God, Father?

53:29.208 --> 53:31.917
Father, give me the brown flask.
Alonso, the washbasin!

53:36.875 --> 53:40.875
I don't care what you snatch,
cabbage, potatoes, anything fresh.

53:41.042 --> 53:44.708
We can't keep waiting here,
we need to stop this beriberi.

53:46.375 --> 53:47.833
Didn't you want to be a hero?

53:49.250 --> 53:52.250
Better this than crossing
the Sierra Madre to Manila.

53:53.417 --> 53:55.167
I can't do it alone, Lieutenant.

53:58.333 --> 54:00.833
Take Jose, it'll do him good.

54:14.667 --> 54:17.333
- I can't take any more.
- Come on, nearly there.

54:17.500 --> 54:19.583
- You go on...
- Shit, Jose!

54:46.458 --> 54:47.833
A dog!

55:14.708 --> 55:18.208
Let's get out of here!
Carlos, they're coming!

55:28.625 --> 55:30.542
Go! Go!

55:30.708 --> 55:32.458
Hurry! Go!

55:39.958 --> 55:42.583
My Virgin! My Virgin!

55:42.750 --> 55:45.208
I have to go back!
Leave me alone!

55:45.375 --> 55:47.500
I have to go out there!

55:49.333 --> 55:51.542
Let me go out there!

56:20.958 --> 56:22.375
We could've brought it in.

56:24.083 --> 56:25.375
What?

56:25.542 --> 56:26.583
The dog.

56:27.958 --> 56:29.417
It was big.

56:29.583 --> 56:32.333
Okay, don't think about that now,

56:33.250 --> 56:34.917
the main thing is to save your arm.

56:37.250 --> 56:39.375
It'll be alright, won't it?

56:39.542 --> 56:41.583
You've always got your left arm.

56:42.958 --> 56:45.000
It's not like you're going
to be Goya, right?

58:00.375 --> 58:02.708
Ever been with a woman?

58:04.833 --> 58:06.458
Why do you ask?

58:07.667 --> 58:08.792
I haven't.

58:11.042 --> 58:12.958
Not even with a bad girl.

58:19.375 --> 58:21.792
My grandfather on my mom's side
died of syphilis.

58:22.542 --> 58:24.292
He was widowed young...

58:26.417 --> 58:28.042
and he was a womanizer.

58:29.333 --> 58:30.917
When he had bad days,
my mother and I

58:31.083 --> 58:33.417
would treat his skin pustules.

58:36.292 --> 58:37.583
It smelt terrible,

58:39.250 --> 58:41.750
like rotting meat.

58:45.625 --> 58:47.625
Do you think that in Heaven...?

58:47.792 --> 58:48.792
No.

58:51.292 --> 58:53.375
How do you know
what I'm going to ask?

58:54.292 --> 58:57.625
Son, our Heaven is boring.

58:57.792 --> 59:00.417
There are no virgins...

59:01.583 --> 59:04.125
or maidens like the Moors have.

59:04.292 --> 59:06.333
Why them and not us?

59:07.917 --> 59:10.542
A good question for the Creator,

59:12.125 --> 59:15.417
but if it's any consolation,

59:15.583 --> 59:19.083
it could be worse.

59:19.250 --> 59:20.375
Worse?

59:21.417 --> 59:23.292
In Oriental religions,

59:23.917 --> 59:25.500
when you die

59:25.667 --> 59:28.042
you start on a road of reincarnation

59:28.208 --> 59:31.333
that may last
for seventy thousand lives.

59:32.250 --> 59:36.042
Some are long,
like those of elephants,

59:36.208 --> 59:39.458
others are short, like those of...

59:41.417 --> 59:42.917
cockroaches.

59:44.083 --> 59:45.917
I don't want to be a cockroach.

59:46.083 --> 59:49.833
Neither do I,
and that's why I thank God

59:51.125 --> 59:54.125
for the blessed fortune
of being a Christian,

59:56.042 --> 59:58.208
even if our Heaven is crap.

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:37.458
We bring oranges.

01:00:42.458 --> 01:00:44.542
A gift from Commander Luna.

01:00:46.667 --> 01:00:49.583
The Commander says

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:51.375
you can sow next to the church.

01:00:51.875 --> 01:00:53.375
It will be friendly territory.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.750
Friendly?

01:00:57.042 --> 01:00:59.500
That's what he said... "friendly".

01:01:04.083 --> 01:01:07.042
We're not surrendering
for a garden and some oranges.

01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:10.500
The Commander asks you
to read these.

01:01:12.417 --> 01:01:15.708
They're newspapers from Manila.

01:01:26.667 --> 01:01:28.458
The Commander wants peace.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:33.000
Aren't his men enough?
Now he sends in his whores?

01:01:36.375 --> 01:01:38.167
You're a good man, Lieutenant.

01:01:39.083 --> 01:01:41.167
I told my people
what you did for me.

01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.583
- I didn't do anything.
- You saved my life.

01:01:45.625 --> 01:01:47.750
Do the same for your soldiers.

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.250
Save them.

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:52.542
What I do is none of your business.

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:55.167
We're not spiteful.

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:58.625
I like Spanish men.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:04.625
Instead of being in there,
locked away,

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:09.000
you could be here, celebrating,

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:11.208
enjoying yourselves.

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.583
Get the fuck out of here. Go!

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:18.958
It's all true.

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:32.250
Pick that up.

01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:11.750
Hey, slowly, slowly.

01:03:15.250 --> 01:03:17.792
I'm just saying they might
take it the wrong way.

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.958
Accepting the gifts?

01:03:20.917 --> 01:03:21.917
Yes, Lieutenant.

01:03:21.958 --> 01:03:24.917
I don't give a shit.
I need strong men,

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:28.000
healthy men, or tell me how
we can defend this church.

01:03:28.167 --> 01:03:30.542
- As we have up to now.
- Tell that to Vigil,

01:03:30.708 --> 01:03:32.125
his infirmary is full,

01:03:32.292 --> 01:03:35.292
tell that to Father Carmelo,
he's sick of giving last rites.

01:03:35.833 --> 01:03:36.958
Right.

01:03:37.125 --> 01:03:40.375
Or do you want us to keep dying
until you take command?

01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:47.292
- I don't know what you mean.
- What's your point?

01:03:47.833 --> 01:03:49.667
You can do better than I can?

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:53.250
You think I'm afraid to die here?

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:55.833
I have no one in Spain.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:59.500
No wife, no children.
I asked to come to this war.

01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:01.375
Then do it right, Lieutenant.

01:04:01.542 --> 01:04:03.375
As you did when the Tagalog
massacred us?

01:04:03.542 --> 01:04:05.083
We fought to the end.

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:09.125
You surrendered.
That's the difference between us.

01:04:09.667 --> 01:04:11.625
No one's surrendering here,

01:04:11.792 --> 01:04:13.792
whatever happens
or whoever may fall.

01:04:18.792 --> 01:04:20.583
Sergeant...

01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:25.250
Tear up those pamphlets.

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:28.917
It doesn't leave this room.

01:04:45.125 --> 01:04:47.333
DECEMBER 31, 1898
SIX MONTHS OF SIEGE

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.500
<i>Spaniards,
today's a day to celebrate.</i>

01:04:50.667 --> 01:04:52.667
<i>Lay down arms
and come into town,</i>

01:04:52.833 --> 01:04:55.083
<i>we're celebrating.</i>

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:58.500
<i>You can have some fun!
Listen to me and come here!</i>

01:04:59.542 --> 01:05:03.000
<i>Look at the women
we have for you!</i>

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:05.208
<i>All of them for you!</i>

01:05:05.375 --> 01:05:09.167
<i>When did you last touch a woman?</i>

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:12.583
<i>All this talk of decency!
Forget the priests,</i>

01:05:13.292 --> 01:05:15.917
<i>forget Spain and come into town,</i>

01:05:16.083 --> 01:05:17.500
<i>- we're celebrating.
- F amen.</i>

01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:21.083
Tonight open all the wine.
Let the men celebrate.

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:01.917
Here, son.

01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.708
There isn't much left.

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:08.875
No.

01:06:09.917 --> 01:06:11.917
There's enough here to say
goodbye to the year.

01:06:12.083 --> 01:06:14.292
I mean the opium.

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:15.458
What?

01:06:16.583 --> 01:06:19.750
Up to now, it's helped us hold on.

01:06:21.167 --> 01:06:23.958
But when it's gone,
we must be strong, very strong.

01:06:24.125 --> 01:06:27.875
Especially here.

01:06:31.208 --> 01:06:34.625
The first days are the worst,
but it'll pass.

01:06:35.667 --> 01:06:37.042
Everything passes.

01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:06.958
Here.

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:08.792
Go on, cheer up.

01:07:09.833 --> 01:07:11.917
To us,
getting out of this church alive.

01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:25.958
Vigil, has anyone seen
Father Carmelo?

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:28.750
I left him in the sacristy,
visiting the sick.

01:07:28.917 --> 01:07:30.958
Find him so he can bless
the New Year.

01:07:32.917 --> 01:07:35.458
Go and get him.

01:07:38.292 --> 01:07:39.292
Father...

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:44.083
Father.

01:07:46.042 --> 01:07:47.250
Father, what have you done?

01:07:47.417 --> 01:07:50.458
Carlos, is he down there?

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:56.375
Carlos, have you found
Father Carmelo?

01:07:58.417 --> 01:07:59.500
He's here!

01:08:01.875 --> 01:08:03.000
Get Vigil.

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:07.083
- Get Vigil.
- Oh, fuck...

01:08:26.582 --> 01:08:29.207
May his soul rest in peace.
Amen.

01:11:29.292 --> 01:11:31.750
- Lieutenant.
- Get some rest. Everyone.

01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:34.000
- We're on guard until...
- That's an order.

01:11:50.583 --> 01:11:52.917
<i>I need your kisses...</i>

01:11:53.083 --> 01:11:54.667
<i>l need...</i>

01:12:05.833 --> 01:12:09.167
<i>I will tell you...</i>

01:13:36.167 --> 01:13:39.667
Artillery fire! Artillery fire!

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:41.083
They're shelling us!

01:13:43.167 --> 01:13:45.958
- Someone to the bell tower!
- Let's go! Get up!

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:48.542
- To your posts!
- Go! Hurry!

01:13:48.708 --> 01:13:50.833
- Come on, go!
- They've got a cannon.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.125
- Where'd they get it from?
- Hurry!

01:13:54.292 --> 01:13:55.792
Let's go, hurry!

01:13:57.625 --> 01:13:59.042
Fire!

01:14:04.583 --> 01:14:08.000
- What's happening?
- Take cover! Get down!

01:14:12.917 --> 01:14:14.125
What do we do?

01:14:15.583 --> 01:14:18.250
- The cannon's out of range.
- Then what?

01:14:21.208 --> 01:14:23.750
Fire!

01:15:03.917 --> 01:15:07.000
"You see the attacks
the Devil and the world

01:15:07.167 --> 01:15:10.083
make everywhere on the faith,

01:15:10.250 --> 01:15:13.875
in which, to gain eternal glory,

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:16.917
we desire, by the grace of God

01:15:17.083 --> 01:15:19.208
to live and die.

01:15:20.958 --> 01:15:24.208
You, the aid of Christians,

01:15:24.375 --> 01:15:27.125
renew, for your sons' salvation,

01:15:27.292 --> 01:15:29.167
the ancient victories..."

01:15:40.083 --> 01:15:42.792
Help me! Help me!

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:47.542
"They pledge to you
the firm intention..."

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:51.333
We'll never get out of here,
we'll die one by one

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.500
- today, tomorrow, in a week...
- Shut the fuck up!

01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:02.250
We must go out and fight,

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.458
fight like men.

01:16:05.875 --> 01:16:08.083
We put powder in the breech,
seal it

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:10.125
and blow the cannon sky high.

01:16:10.292 --> 01:16:12.708
- How do we get to the cannon?
- With balls,

01:16:12.917 --> 01:16:14.333
what you're all lacking.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.750
I need every man
in fighting condition.

01:16:16.917 --> 01:16:19.042
It'll only be one, short attack.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.958
If it goes wrong, it's all over,

01:16:21.125 --> 01:16:23.958
there'll be no one in any state
to defend the church,

01:16:24.125 --> 01:16:26.083
but if it succeeds...

01:16:26.375 --> 01:16:27.875
<i>We'll go in two groups</i>

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:31.167
<i>so they think there are more
of us and the surprise is greater.</i>

01:16:31.333 --> 01:16:35.083
<i>I'll attack on the right flank,
Sergeant Jimeno, the left.</i>

01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:37.833
<i>I'll give you time
to take your positions.</i>

01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:39.625
<i>We can't risk any signals.</i>

01:16:39.792 --> 01:16:42.042
<i>Wait for me to open fire.</i>

01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:03.375
How long do we wait here?

01:17:03.542 --> 01:17:06.875
- Until the lieutenant opens fire.
- What's he waiting for?

01:17:19.333 --> 01:17:21.208
What's wrong with you?

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.042
Nothing.

01:17:24.208 --> 01:17:25.250
Nothing?

01:17:27.333 --> 01:17:30.458
You're not thinking of deserting
and joining your pal?

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:33.792
No, I'm not thinking of anything.

01:17:42.167 --> 01:17:44.292
- What's that?
- What?

01:17:45.917 --> 01:17:47.833
Hear that?

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.333
It's a buffalo.

01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:50.958
Get out of the way, fuck!

01:18:07.708 --> 01:18:09.958
What the hell are you doing?

01:18:15.875 --> 01:18:17.500
Cover his mouth
so he doesn't scream.

01:18:22.125 --> 01:18:23.542
Tie him up on the ground.

01:18:24.917 --> 01:18:27.250
Sergeant, there are crocodiles.

01:18:28.250 --> 01:18:29.750
Is he your son?

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:37.708
The cannon!
What are you waiting for?

01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:20.000
Cut it out.

01:19:21.042 --> 01:19:22.958
Stop it!

01:19:25.167 --> 01:19:26.958
He's dead, can't you see?

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:34.917
Go, get away! Go!

01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:49.667
- There, behind that cabin!
- Fire! Fire over there!

01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:53.208
Where are you going? Halt!

01:19:53.917 --> 01:19:56.157
- What are you doing, Sergeant?
- He's running off! Fuck!

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.083
Here! Help me!

01:19:59.250 --> 01:20:03.083
- I can't control them!
- We have to go now! Let's go!

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:06.250
- They're regrouping!
- C'mon, grab it all! Go!

01:20:07.792 --> 01:20:10.917
Grab any food you can find!

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:14.125
Go, Jimeno!
Carlos and I will cover you.

01:20:14.292 --> 01:20:16.417
Move it! Go!

01:20:16.583 --> 01:20:17.875
Let's

01:20:21.333 --> 01:20:24.375
The fire will cover us.
We'll burn the whole town down.

01:20:26.375 --> 01:20:27.792
Burn it all down.

01:20:35.042 --> 01:20:37.333
Carlos, we have to go now!

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.375
- We can win the war!
- Carlos...

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:45.917
We can win it.

01:21:31.542 --> 01:21:32.792
What happened?

01:21:34.333 --> 01:21:36.042
The sergeant found something.

01:21:37.208 --> 01:21:39.500
It was hidden in
a sack in the basement.

01:21:40.542 --> 01:21:43.375
- How long have you been smoking it?
- I don't know what you mean.

01:21:43.542 --> 01:21:44.875
You don't?

01:21:45.042 --> 01:21:46.792
- You're sick.
- No.

01:21:46.958 --> 01:21:49.583
- You think we're idiots?
- You're sick! Don't deny it.

01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:52.292
- Dilated pupils, goose bumps...
- lt's not true!

01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:55.333
- Take him to the basement.
- We could cure him here.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.500
- Leave me alone!
- No! To the basement!

01:21:57.667 --> 01:22:00.458
C'mon, to the basement.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:03.583
Let's go! Come on!

01:22:04.125 --> 01:22:06.958
Let me go! Let me go!

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:11.250
No!

01:22:14.708 --> 01:22:17.388
- Don't do this to me, Lieutenant!
- The worst thing is the anxiety.

01:22:17.417 --> 01:22:19.625
Keep your mind busy.

01:22:19.792 --> 01:22:21.333
No...

01:22:21.500 --> 01:22:24.500
Don't leave me here!
Oh God, I'm begging you!

01:22:24.667 --> 01:22:27.708
Don't leave me here!
I'm begging you!

01:22:27.875 --> 01:22:31.375
I’m begging You"-

01:22:44.625 --> 01:22:46.708
Fine wine all around!

01:24:15.333 --> 01:24:17.333
MAY 18, 1899

01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:19.917
TEN MONTHS OF SIEGE

01:24:33.417 --> 01:24:34.625
Welcome to the world.

01:24:35.667 --> 01:24:36.792
Everything alright?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.542
Hey, at last!

01:24:52.542 --> 01:24:53.875
A little wine?

01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:58.042
Eat. Get your strength back.

01:25:12.750 --> 01:25:14.833
A ship!

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:17.583
A ship in the bay!

01:25:19.458 --> 01:25:20.458
Is it Spanish?

01:25:26.875 --> 01:25:29.292
It's not a Spanish patrol boat.

01:25:35.875 --> 01:25:38.583
It's a lieutenant colonel's uniform,
but it's obsolete.

01:25:39.167 --> 01:25:40.583
This looks like a set-up.

01:25:42.250 --> 01:25:44.708
Let's see what he has to say.

01:25:44.875 --> 01:25:46.708
Don't let him come any closer.

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:51.000
It's just one man.
Are we that frightened?

01:25:54.208 --> 01:25:57.833
Moisés and Pedro,
cover us from the front door.

01:26:02.583 --> 01:26:05.458
Cristóbal Aguilar y Castañeda,
Lt. Colonel in the Spanish Army,

01:26:05.625 --> 01:26:07.292
under orders from General Rios.

01:26:07.458 --> 01:26:10.083
Lieutenant Martin Cerezo,
2nd Ranger Battalion.

01:26:10.333 --> 01:26:13.583
I'm here to give this document
to Captain Las Morenas.

01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:16.000
Captain Las Morenas is indisposed.

01:26:16.167 --> 01:26:17.583
What does that mean?

01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:19.250
He can't receive you,

01:26:20.083 --> 01:26:22.583
but you can speak to me.

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.417
- Let me inside the church.
- We'll talk here.

01:26:25.583 --> 01:26:27.063
- What did you say?
- We'll talk here.

01:26:27.208 --> 01:26:31.042
Who do you think you're talking to?
I'm your superior officer.

01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:34.375
Who advised you?
That uniform is obsolete.

01:26:36.667 --> 01:26:39.958
I order you to let me
into the church at once!

01:26:42.458 --> 01:26:45.667
Do you want me to report you
for insubordination?

01:26:47.833 --> 01:26:50.750
I'm here to give the order
to hand over this position.

01:26:50.917 --> 01:26:52.208
Read it yourself.

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:54.500
How do I know it's legitimate?

01:26:54.667 --> 01:26:56.208
It has General Rios' signature.

01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:57.833
Anyone can forge a signature.

01:27:02.083 --> 01:27:05.125
This is a copy of "El Imparcial",
a Spanish newspaper.

01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:08.000
It has news on
the loss of the colonies.

01:27:08.167 --> 01:27:10.167
- You think I forged that tool?
- Save your newspapers,

01:27:10.333 --> 01:27:13.042
- they've brought us others.
- You're acting like a fool!

01:27:13.208 --> 01:27:16.208
I'm covered by article 748
of the field regulations:

01:27:16.375 --> 01:27:18.375
"An order in writing to surrender

01:27:18.542 --> 01:27:20.125
must not be obeyed
until verified as authentic".

01:27:20.292 --> 01:27:22.500
Call Captain Las Morenas,
he knows me.

01:27:22.667 --> 01:27:23.542
That's not going to happen.

01:27:23.708 --> 01:27:26.125
Why defend a position
that no longer belongs to Spain?

01:27:26.292 --> 01:27:28.500
Then why attack us like this?

01:27:28.667 --> 01:27:32.667
The Filipinos attack because
you've no right to be here.

01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:34.542
Read the damned document!

01:27:34.708 --> 01:27:37.125
It says that Spain ceded,
last December 10th,

01:27:37.292 --> 01:27:40.042
all of its Overseas Territories
to the United States.

01:27:40.208 --> 01:27:43.542
Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines
have lost Spanish sovereignty.

01:27:44.667 --> 01:27:46.958
Your mission here is over.

01:27:47.292 --> 01:27:49.208
See for yourself.

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:55.167
When you're convinced,
raise the white flag.

01:27:55.333 --> 01:27:58.333
The sooner we end this insanity,
the better it is for everyone.

01:28:04.792 --> 01:28:07.583
<i>"On receipt of an order
in writing from a superior</i>

01:28:07.750 --> 01:28:10.000
to surrender a position,
its execution is suspended

01:28:10.167 --> 01:28:12.375
until authenticity is verified,

01:28:12.542 --> 01:28:14.000
by sending, if possible,

01:28:14.167 --> 01:28:17.083
a person of trust
to check it verbally."

01:28:17.250 --> 01:28:19.875
I'm not falling for this,
least of all now.

01:28:20.042 --> 01:28:22.042
The tone and phrasing sound real.

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:24.667
They want it to sound real.

01:28:24.833 --> 01:28:27.083
But he asked to see the captain,
he said he knew him.

01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:28.042
And...?

01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:31.292
If you're lying you don't risk
saying something that can be proven.

01:28:31.458 --> 01:28:33.792
Only we know
that Enrique is dead.

01:28:33.958 --> 01:28:36.083
He's smart.
He was sent to confuse us.

01:28:36.250 --> 01:28:37.667
- What if he's telling the truth?
- He's lying!

01:28:37.833 --> 01:28:39.208
We don't know that!

01:28:41.167 --> 01:28:43.007
If the Field Marshal sent him,
he would've come

01:28:43.167 --> 01:28:45.625
on a Spanish patrol boat
and not alone.

01:28:52.375 --> 01:28:56.000
If this document is true, we've been fighting
for almost a year for the hell of it.

01:28:56.167 --> 01:28:59.708
Nobody's fighting for the hell of it!
We're defending ourselves

01:28:59.875 --> 01:29:01.625
from men firing a cannon at us!

01:29:56.042 --> 01:29:58.333
<i>You've lost your last chance</i>

01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:01.208
<i>to get out alive, Spaniards.</i>

01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.875
Your last chance!

01:30:07.083 --> 01:30:08.542
You've been shut in there
for a year

01:30:08.708 --> 01:30:11.125
while Spain is laughing at you!

01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:15.000
You're not going to die for Spain!

01:30:15.375 --> 01:30:17.375
You're going to die
because you're idiots!

01:30:18.250 --> 01:30:22.000
That's what you are,
a bunch of idiots!

01:30:22.167 --> 01:30:24.708
Fuck you! Fuck you all!

01:30:26.042 --> 01:30:27.792
You know how
you'll be remembered?

01:30:28.833 --> 01:30:30.708
How you'll go down in history?

01:30:32.167 --> 01:30:35.000
You'll be known
as the nitwits of Baler!

01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:38.875
The pigs of Baler! Fuck!

01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:50.042
Why doesn't he go back to Spain?

01:30:50.208 --> 01:30:53.625
He can't. If he went back
without us, they'd shoot him.

01:30:53.792 --> 01:30:54.792
Sure.

01:30:56.542 --> 01:30:58.625
We're at war, aren't we?

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:06.417
Fire! Go!

01:31:06.583 --> 01:31:08.708
Don't let them get close!

01:31:08.875 --> 01:31:12.333
Fire, damn it! Fire!

01:31:44.125 --> 01:31:46.792
Lieutenant...

01:31:50.833 --> 01:31:53.000
I want to comply with regulations.

01:31:53.167 --> 01:31:54.167
Excuse me?

01:31:54.208 --> 01:31:57.792
I'll be the person of trust that
goes to check if it's true.

01:31:57.958 --> 01:31:59.750
How will you check it?

01:32:00.625 --> 01:32:02.708
I'll go to Manila, Lieutenant.

01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:05.708
Have you been smoking the opium again?

01:32:07.667 --> 01:32:10.625
- If we'd listened to the captain...
- You'd be dead.

01:32:11.583 --> 01:32:14.500
- That's what would've happened.
- We can't keep waiting here.

01:32:14.667 --> 01:32:17.500
Are you looking for
your exemplary service letter?

01:32:18.458 --> 01:32:20.458
Your mayor tricked you, Carlos.

01:32:20.625 --> 01:32:23.083
That school won't take
people like you.

01:32:23.250 --> 01:32:24.917
If we stay here, we'll die.

01:32:26.167 --> 01:32:28.000
You won't make it to Manila alive.

01:32:34.750 --> 01:32:36.958
You're coming back, aren't you?

01:32:38.083 --> 01:32:39.292
Of course.

01:32:40.583 --> 01:32:42.542
I'll bring reinforcements.

01:32:42.708 --> 01:32:44.625
There won't be anyone in Manila.

01:32:44.875 --> 01:32:45.875
It doesn't matter.

01:32:46.958 --> 01:32:49.417
I'll be back.

01:36:50.125 --> 01:36:51.333
Well, well...

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.833
Where'd he come from?

01:36:58.667 --> 01:37:00.208
Where were you headed?

01:37:00.667 --> 01:37:01.333
Manila.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:03.250
There are no Spaniards in Manila.

01:37:04.125 --> 01:37:06.458
My army?

01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.792
Your army...

01:37:09.958 --> 01:37:12.417
sold the Philippines to the Americans.

01:37:14.875 --> 01:37:17.458
Now we're fighting them.

01:37:21.417 --> 01:37:23.125
You're not allies anymore?

01:37:23.292 --> 01:37:25.292
They didn't come to help,

01:37:26.792 --> 01:37:28.500
they came to stay.

01:37:36.125 --> 01:37:39.000
You didn't know
what was going on at all

01:37:39.167 --> 01:37:41.833
inside that church, did you?

01:37:43.292 --> 01:37:45.667
You're alone, soldier.
There's no empire,

01:37:45.917 --> 01:37:49.333
no army, no glory to defend.

01:37:52.042 --> 01:37:54.083
My war is not with you.

01:37:59.667 --> 01:38:01.125
You're not my prisoner.

01:38:02.167 --> 01:38:05.417
If you insist on going to Manila,
I'll give you a horse.

01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:07.458
But there's nothing there.

01:38:18.875 --> 01:38:21.083
If you go back to the church,
you're a fool.

01:38:23.208 --> 01:38:24.625
I'm not a fool,

01:38:25.667 --> 01:38:27.417
nor am I a traitor.

01:38:31.875 --> 01:38:35.208
A traitor to what... and to whom?

01:38:35.792 --> 01:38:39.000
Spain sold the Philippines
to the Yankees!

01:38:39.167 --> 01:38:42.458
Our government sold the Philippines
for 20 million dollars!

01:38:42.625 --> 01:38:45.125
All these heroics
and shit they got us to do,

01:38:45.292 --> 01:38:48.750
and in the end what counted
was money. As usual!

01:38:53.083 --> 01:38:56.292
And what do you think they'll do
with all that money?

01:38:56.458 --> 01:38:59.958
Give it to the families of the dead
in Cuba, the Philippines,

01:39:00.125 --> 01:39:01.458
Puerto Rico?

01:39:04.833 --> 01:39:08.042
Will they give it to your mother
when you're buried here?

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:10.333
No.

01:39:11.375 --> 01:39:13.750
They'll keep it for themselves.

01:39:13.917 --> 01:39:16.792
They don't give a shit
about us, Carlos.

01:39:20.875 --> 01:39:24.042
If you want to give your life for
some dirt bag then that's up to you.

01:40:05.625 --> 01:40:08.292
It's all lies! You weren't going
to try to reach Manila?

01:40:08.458 --> 01:40:11.042
Manila is occupied by the Americans.

01:40:11.208 --> 01:40:14.958
The Filipinos are fighting them.
We've got no business here.

01:40:15.125 --> 01:40:17.417
That's for me to decide!

01:40:18.750 --> 01:40:20.042
Do you really think

01:40:20.208 --> 01:40:23.625
anyone would take the trouble
to forge all these papers

01:40:23.792 --> 01:40:25.292
for us, for this church?

01:40:25.458 --> 01:40:27.542
Can't you see they're full of lies?!

01:40:28.583 --> 01:40:30.423
20 million for Puerto Rico
and the Philippines?

01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:32.458
What kind of deal is that?

01:40:32.625 --> 01:40:36.458
You've got education and sense.
Would you do business this way?

01:40:36.625 --> 01:40:39.750
They're telling us that
they're willing to buy us,

01:40:39.917 --> 01:40:41.792
that our surrender has a price,

01:40:42.167 --> 01:40:44.667
and that insults
the memory of our dead.

01:40:46.375 --> 01:40:48.735
Not to mention that stupid
naval battle in Santiago de Cuba.

01:40:48.792 --> 01:40:51.958
You don't need a degree to know that
if your ships aren't battle-ready

01:40:52.125 --> 01:40:55.333
they stay in port and defend the bay
from land. It's common sense.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.750
Common sense!

01:40:57.792 --> 01:41:00.417
Do you think our leaders
in Madrid have common sense?

01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:05.375
They sent me here
not knowing how to shoot,

01:41:05.542 --> 01:41:07.917
- and with no boots...
- This is different.

01:41:08.083 --> 01:41:11.750
One thing is being inept,
another is what these papers say.

01:41:11.917 --> 01:41:15.042
If someone gave the order to face
the American fleet in those conditions,

01:41:15.208 --> 01:41:16.792
they should be shot for treason.

01:41:18.333 --> 01:41:20.125
Do you think we're led by a traitor?

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:24.375
No, Lieutenant, not a traitor,

01:41:25.958 --> 01:41:27.667
an incompetent.

01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:29.792
I'm neither one nor the other.

01:41:31.042 --> 01:41:34.458
And until I know for sure what's
going on outside, I'll keep fighting.

01:41:37.792 --> 01:41:39.042
Dismissed.

01:41:49.042 --> 01:41:50.208
I don't know.

01:41:53.333 --> 01:41:54.500
You don't know?

01:41:55.583 --> 01:41:57.042
It's risky.

01:41:57.208 --> 01:42:00.125
Risky? Staying here is risky.

01:42:00.625 --> 01:42:02.625
It's only two hundred yards.

01:42:02.792 --> 01:42:04.458
They'll shoot us in the back.

01:42:05.333 --> 01:42:07.375
No, they won't.

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.083
I don't want to fight
in any more wars.

01:42:14.250 --> 01:42:16.667
What if the Filipinos make us
fight the Americans?

01:42:16.833 --> 01:42:18.750
They gave me their word.

01:42:18.917 --> 01:42:22.667
If we surrender they'll let us
leave the Philippines.

01:42:24.125 --> 01:42:25.750
I don't want to end up like Juan,

01:42:25.917 --> 01:42:29.375
- unable to go home.
- Staying here is madness.

01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:32.958
And I'm not mad.

01:44:22.667 --> 01:44:25.000
On your knees! On the ground!

01:44:25.167 --> 01:44:26.833
On your knees, the three of you!

01:44:29.083 --> 01:44:31.542
I knew you'd run off eventually.

01:44:32.708 --> 01:44:34.000
Right?

01:44:37.583 --> 01:44:39.875
Do you know the penalty for treason?

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:42.500
Do you?

01:44:48.250 --> 01:44:49.375
Halt!

01:44:50.667 --> 01:44:52.458
Halt!

01:45:07.292 --> 01:45:10.833
You want to give us to the Tagalog
so they can machete us?

01:45:11.625 --> 01:45:13.875
Is that what you wanted?

01:45:47.625 --> 01:45:49.917
I won't have you shot, Carlos.

01:45:50.083 --> 01:45:51.708
I don't shoot wounded men.

01:45:54.083 --> 01:45:55.667
What about Jose and Carvajal?

01:46:02.333 --> 01:46:03.833
They'll be executed.

01:46:05.625 --> 01:46:08.208
- I convinced them to run away.
- We're doing it tomorrow

01:46:08.833 --> 01:46:11.042
- in the courtyard.
- We're not at war.

01:46:11.333 --> 01:46:14.375
- You'll hear it from here.
- You're wrong! You're wrong!

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:17.458
I saved your life twice, Carlos.

01:46:18.083 --> 01:46:20.583
When I didn't send you to Manila,
as the captain wanted,

01:46:20.917 --> 01:46:22.958
and when I carried you back
on my shoulders.

01:46:24.792 --> 01:46:26.667
Which time was I wrong?

01:46:33.833 --> 01:46:34.875
No...

01:46:35.917 --> 01:46:36.958
No...

01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:53.833
Shooting those soldiers
will cause a mutiny.

01:46:55.292 --> 01:46:56.667
They're deserters.

01:46:57.708 --> 01:47:00.458
They've fought for a year,
like the others.

01:47:00.625 --> 01:47:03.250
- The field regulations...
- Screw the field regulations!

01:47:03.417 --> 01:47:06.125
You don't want to see
what's happening.

01:47:06.958 --> 01:47:08.750
You'd really put two soldiers
against a wall

01:47:08.917 --> 01:47:12.625
and tell six others to kill them?

01:47:36.417 --> 01:47:38.042
Moisés.

01:47:38.333 --> 01:47:41.083
- Get your rifle and follow us.
- What?

01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:43.250
Your rifle, get it.

01:47:46.167 --> 01:47:47.375
You go to sleep.

01:48:13.792 --> 01:48:15.625
Lieutenant, this is illegal.

01:48:17.917 --> 01:48:19.333
This way they won't suffer.

01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:21.500
That's why I'm doing it, Moises,

01:48:23.167 --> 01:48:25.000
so they don't suffer.

01:48:37.333 --> 01:48:38.875
Aim.

01:48:47.792 --> 01:48:50.417
Aim. That's an order.

01:49:17.542 --> 01:49:18.833
Fire.

01:50:27.333 --> 01:50:30.792
Aim at the officer! Go!

01:51:45.708 --> 01:51:47.167
You have to aim!

01:51:48.458 --> 01:51:50.667
Wounded to the spare beds!

01:52:37.583 --> 01:52:41.583
PERSONNEL TRANSFERS

01:52:54.292 --> 01:52:55.667
What's wrong, Private?

01:52:56.708 --> 01:52:59.167
You didn't have the balls
to run off after all, eh?

01:52:59.333 --> 01:53:00.333
Are you alright?

01:53:02.292 --> 01:53:04.792
You still have time, right, Private?

01:53:04.958 --> 01:53:07.500
Stop talking!

01:53:31.625 --> 01:53:33.375
It's the surrender order.

01:53:42.875 --> 01:53:44.917
Not because they've defeated me.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:51.833
We have enough ammunition
for two more months,

01:53:53.417 --> 01:53:55.792
and this wall can be repaired.

01:54:20.875 --> 01:54:22.667
I found a news item.

01:54:23.125 --> 01:54:24.667
Real news.

01:54:26.917 --> 01:54:28.125
On page 3.

01:54:28.750 --> 01:54:30.708
"Personnel Transfers".

01:54:34.333 --> 01:54:37.292
They're commissions
for infantry officers.

01:54:37.458 --> 01:54:39.583
One of them is Francisco Diaz.

01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:46.875
He's been posted
to the barracks in Málaga.

01:54:50.208 --> 01:54:51.292
And?

01:54:52.417 --> 01:54:55.000
I've known Francisco for 14 years.

01:54:55.167 --> 01:54:58.708
We served in
the 17th Bourbon Regiment.

01:55:04.208 --> 01:55:07.208
I know he always wanted
to be posted to Málaga.

01:55:08.583 --> 01:55:10.292
So...?

01:55:10.458 --> 01:55:13.333
This news can't be fake.

01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:16.458
I've been going over it...

01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:20.750
and however much I rattle my brain,

01:55:24.208 --> 01:55:27.042
the Filipinos couldn't have known
what it says there.

01:55:27.208 --> 01:55:30.125
No. There's no way.

01:55:33.208 --> 01:55:34.750
Stupid, isn't it?

01:55:35.875 --> 01:55:37.875
An absurd piece of news,

01:55:41.708 --> 01:55:43.333
an notice about transfers...

01:55:43.500 --> 01:55:46.083
proves that the newspapers
are telling the truth.

01:55:51.125 --> 01:55:53.458
- How does it feel, Lieutenant?
- I complied with

01:55:53.625 --> 01:55:57.250
- the field regulations.
- I’m asking you how it feels.

01:55:57.417 --> 01:55:59.208
I may have been wrong, Carlos.

01:55:59.792 --> 01:56:02.875
I may have made mistakes,
but my conscience is clear.

01:56:09.125 --> 01:56:10.458
Then say it.

01:56:13.292 --> 01:56:14.375
Say:

01:56:15.458 --> 01:56:17.625
"The Filipinos were right.

01:56:19.667 --> 01:56:22.792
The newspapers
were telling the truth."

01:56:24.833 --> 01:56:25.833
Say it.

01:56:25.958 --> 01:56:27.750
We lost the war, Carlos.

01:56:27.917 --> 01:56:31.125
Our army surrendered and we lost.

01:56:31.292 --> 01:56:34.708
That's the only truth.

01:56:58.750 --> 01:57:02.750
JUNE 2, 1899
ELEVEN MONTHS OF SIEGE

01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:10.000
We've got nothing white.
I suppose it'll do.

01:57:21.292 --> 01:57:24.167
Go to the courtyard and sound
assembly and surrender.

01:57:28.542 --> 01:57:29.750
You raise the flag.

01:58:32.417 --> 01:58:34.708
Commander.

01:58:35.042 --> 01:58:36.375
Lieutenant.

01:58:36.542 --> 01:58:38.708
This is the surrender order.

01:58:41.417 --> 01:58:44.375
I only have one condition,
and I will not budge on this.

01:58:44.958 --> 01:58:46.292
I'm listening.

01:58:47.417 --> 01:58:50.292
We will not be taken prisoner
or hand over our weapons.

01:58:50.458 --> 01:58:53.750
- You think we seek vengeance?
- A lot of men have died.

01:58:53.917 --> 01:58:57.208
More on my side than yours,
Lieutenant.

01:58:57.708 --> 01:58:59.958
But my men are not
outlaws or murderers,

01:59:00.292 --> 01:59:02.500
and I think we've shown you that.

01:59:06.833 --> 01:59:08.875
We don't need prisoners,

01:59:10.125 --> 01:59:11.750
and as for your weapons,

01:59:12.375 --> 01:59:15.833
you can take them to
the end of my jurisdiction.

01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.875
After that,

01:59:18.042 --> 01:59:20.292
you'll have to negotiate
with the Americans.

01:59:41.125 --> 01:59:44.417
I'll ask my men to bid you farewell
with a guard of honor.

01:59:49.083 --> 01:59:50.417
A guard of honor?

01:59:51.458 --> 01:59:54.958
It's been four centuries, Lieutenant.

02:00:11.792 --> 02:00:12.958
Lieutenant...

02:00:14.292 --> 02:00:16.917
I've been going over
the death certificates.

02:00:18.333 --> 02:00:21.500
I'd be grateful if the executed men
weren't listed as such.

02:00:22.042 --> 02:00:24.167
I'm thinking about their families.

02:00:25.542 --> 02:00:28.833
In their families
or what your superiors will say?

02:00:31.542 --> 02:00:34.708
Say they died of beriberi.

02:00:36.792 --> 02:00:39.750
I'll put down the real cause,
it's my duty.

02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:47.500
Soldiers!

02:00:48.708 --> 02:00:50.208
Fix yourselves up right.

02:00:52.208 --> 02:00:53.792
When you go outside...

02:00:56.750 --> 02:00:58.083
look up to the sky.

02:01:00.042 --> 02:01:03.625
While we're at it ask God
where He's been all this time, huh?

02:01:13.042 --> 02:01:14.333
To hell with Spain!

02:01:32.375 --> 02:01:33.583
This is for you,

02:01:36.333 --> 02:01:38.542
a letter of exemplary conduct.

02:01:41.083 --> 02:01:42.458
Is this a joke?

02:01:47.583 --> 02:01:49.375
I did one for each man.

02:01:52.333 --> 02:01:55.083
Your mayor will know that
you came and you fought.

02:02:04.667 --> 02:02:08.417
When we get back to Spain,
I'm telling them what went on here.

02:02:09.958 --> 02:02:13.417
And I hope they kick you
out of the Army.

02:02:15.083 --> 02:02:17.292
If that happens,
you'll be doing me a favor.

02:02:43.750 --> 02:02:45.042
Attention!

02:02:46.125 --> 02:02:47.458
Forward march!

02:02:48.500 --> 02:02:50.167
Route march!

02:04:47.125 --> 02:04:50.958
<i>The siege of Baler ended on
June 2, 1899, after 337 days.</i>

02:04:51.125 --> 02:04:53.958
<i>17 Spanish soldiers died
and almost 700 Filipinos.</i>

02:04:55.417 --> 02:04:57.125
<i>The fall of Baler signaled the end</i>

02:04:57.292 --> 02:05:00.000
<i>of one of the greatest empires
the world has ever known</i>

02:05:00.167 --> 02:05:02.292
<i>and it caused
a national tragedy in Spain.</i>

02:05:03.333 --> 02:05:06.167
<i>Of the survivors, only Martin Cerezo
received the Laureate Cross,</i>

02:05:06.333 --> 02:05:08.375
<i>the highest military distinction.</i>

02:05:09.667 --> 02:05:11.083
<i>Despite the end of the war,</i>

02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:14.167
<i>9000 other Spaniards remained
on the Philippines, left to their fate:</i>

02:05:14.333 --> 02:05:16.417
<i>soldiers, priests,
civil servants and deserters</i>

02:05:16.583 --> 02:05:18.625
<i>who stayed until well
into the 20th century.</i>

02:05:20.042 --> 02:05:25.792
<i>Dedicated to those who participated
in the siege of Baler.</i>
