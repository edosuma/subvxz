- STILL BATTLING KLEPTOMANIA,
ANDREW?

00:47.648 --> 00:49.548
YOU KNOW, THE FIRST STEP
IS ADMITTING YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:49.583 --> 00:51.793
- AH, KID'S BIRTHDAY
THIS WEEKEND.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.189
GOOD THING
FOR OUR STORE DISCOUNT.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.121
- YEAH,
YOU COULD GO BROKE.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.326
- WHICH IS
WHY I HOPE I GET THAT JOB.

00:57.358 --> 00:58.828
- WHAT JOB?

00:58.859 --> 01:00.489
- DIDN'T YOU KNOW?

01:00.528 --> 01:02.828
THEY'RE MAKING BARBAROSA
THE NEW DISTRICT MANAGER

01:02.863 --> 01:06.233
FOR ALL THE STORES
IN THE STATE.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.567
- NO SHIT.
- AND THEY'RE LETTING HIM

01:07.601 --> 01:09.371
PICK HIS OWN REPLACEMENT
FROM INSIDE THE STORE,

01:09.403 --> 01:11.843
SO I FIGURED,
"FUCK, MIGHT AS WELL BE ME."

01:11.872 --> 01:15.282
RIGHT?
- RIGHT.

01:15.309 --> 01:19.709
- WELL, I BETTER GO PRACTICE
MY ASS-KISSING.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.717
WISH ME LUCK.
- YOU GOT IT.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.494
- SO?
AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK ME?

01:28.522 --> 01:29.592
- ASK YOU WHAT?

01:29.623 --> 01:32.833
- WHAT I THINK ABOUT YOU
AS BARBAROSA'S REPLACEMENT.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.530
I THINK YOU'D ROCK.
- THANKS, BUT I LIKE MY JOB.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.503
BESIDES, BEING A MANAGER
IS A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.202
- SO?
YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

01:40.234 --> 01:42.544
BESIDES, YOU'RE MUCH BETTER
QUALIFIED THAN ANDREW ANY DAY.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.810
YOU'RE A BETTER WORKER,
YOU'VE BEEN HERE LONGER,

01:44.838 --> 01:47.238
PEOPLE LIKE YOU BETTER,
AND THEN THERE'S THE RAISE.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.305
- YEAH, I GUESS.
- COME ON.

01:49.343 --> 01:50.843
IF YOU WANNA GET AHEAD,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN

01:50.878 --> 01:53.278
TO DO A LITTLE BIT
OF ASS-KISSING, LIKE ANDREW,

01:53.314 --> 01:56.254

KISS ASS WITH THE BEST OF THEM.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.162
I SAID, "FUCK, NO!"

02:07.195 --> 02:08.895
- I THINK YOUR DAD
MIGHT BE RIGHT.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.429
A LITTLE MILITARY SCHOOL
OR SOMETHING

02:10.464 --> 02:11.834
MIGHT DO YOU SOME GOOD.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.665
- I ALWAYS WANTED
TO GO TO MILITARY SCHOOL.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.371
YOU KNOW, THOSE SLEEK UNIFORMS,
WELL CUT.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.459
- AND I HAVE TO GET
A NEW CAR THIS WEEK.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.725
- ANOTHER FUCK-MOBILE?

02:43.764 --> 02:45.974
- PLEASE, AT HIS AGE,
HE NEEDS ALL THE HELP HE CAN GET

02:45.999 --> 02:48.599
TO ATTRACT
THOSE HOT, YOUNG THINGS.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.336
- I THOUGHT
AFTER WHAT HAPPENED,

02:50.371 --> 02:52.811
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE PRACTICAL.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.740
- WHAT, LIKE SOMETHING
AN ACCOUNTANT MIGHT DRIVE?

02:54.775 --> 02:57.345
- YOU DON'T WANT ANY MORE
WEIRDOS RAMMING INTO YOU.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.748
- NEVER HEARD HIM COMPLAIN
ABOUT THAT BEFORE.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.619
- [scoffs]

03:01.649 --> 03:03.949
- SEE YOU LATER.
- LATER.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.494
- ALL RIGHT.
[indistinct chatter]

03:06.520 --> 03:08.290
- I DON'T KNOW.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.562
- YOU'RE EXCITED ABOUT IT,
THOUGH, AREN'T YOU?

03:09.590 --> 03:11.530

03:41.722 --> 03:45.432
- IT'S HIS DAD,
STOP IT.

03:45.459 --> 03:48.929
- THAT'S IT, JUSTIN.
THAT IS IT.

03:48.962 --> 03:51.402
YOU COME HOME WITH ME
RIGHT NOW,

03:51.432 --> 03:53.802
OR YOU NEVER
COME HOME AGAIN.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.644
- FUCK!

03:56.670 --> 03:59.610
- * SWEET, SWEET, SWEET

03:59.640 --> 04:03.610
- NEVER AGAIN.

04:03.644 --> 04:07.324
DID YOU HEAR ME?

04:07.348 --> 04:11.588
I SAID,
"NEVER AGAIN!"

04:11.619 --> 04:15.719
- GO! GET THE FUCK
OUT OF HERE! GO!

04:15.756 --> 04:18.055
I'M NEVER COMING HOME

04:18.091 --> 04:19.430
NEVER!
- JUSTIN.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.329
- FUCKING NEVER!

04:21.362 --> 04:24.302
- STOP.
- [sobs]

04:35.609 --> 04:37.679
SO MY DAD WAS KICKING HIM
AND BEATING HIM,

04:37.711 --> 04:39.411
AND I JUMPED ON HIS BACK,
I PULLED HIM OFF,

04:39.447 --> 04:40.647
AND THEN I START
PUNCHING HIM.

04:40.681 --> 04:41.721
- AND DON'T FORGET
HOW YOU SINGLE-HANDEDLY

04:41.749 --> 04:44.389
FOUGHT OFF THE ATTACK DOGS.
- OR HOW YOU FOILED

04:44.418 --> 04:46.918
THAT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT
BY THE IRANIAN DEATH SQUAD.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.664
- [laughs]
- YOU BOYS THINK THIS IS FUNNY?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.590
HUH, IS THIS YOUR IDEA
OF SOME EVENING ENTERTAINMENT?

04:51.625 --> 04:53.055
THIS POOR CHILD'S
BEEN FUCKING TRAUMATIZED,

04:53.093 --> 04:55.803
WATCHING HIS FATHER
GO BERSERK LIKE THAT.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.769
AND AS FOR YOU,

04:57.798 --> 05:00.468
I TOLD YOU THERE'D BE TROUBLE,
AND YOU DIDN'T LISTEN.

05:00.501 --> 05:02.441
- IT'S NOT HIS FAULT,
AND I'M NOT A CHILD.

05:02.470 --> 05:03.440
I'M TURNING 18 SOON.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.571
THAT MEANS I CAN VOTE

05:04.605 --> 05:05.765
AND GET MARRIED
AND JOIN THE ARMY.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.406
- HOPEFULLY
NOT IN THE SAME DAY.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.981
- MAYBE SO, BUT AS FAR
AS YOUR PARENTS ARE CONCERNED,

05:10.010 --> 05:12.580
YOU'RE STILL THEIR SWEET,
INNOCENT, LITTLE BOY.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.523
THEY'RE NOT READY
TO THINK OF YOU SUCKING COCK

05:14.548 --> 05:15.348
AND TAKING IT
UP THE ASS.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.753
- MA, DO YOU HAVE TO BE
SO GRAPHIC?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.554
- [laughs]

05:22.990 --> 05:24.590
SO WHAT

05:24.625 --> 05:26.355
- SOMETHING ABOUT...
- SUCKING COCK...

05:26.394 --> 05:27.404
- TAKING IT UP THE ASS.

05:27.428 --> 05:30.428
- RIGHT.
SO...

05:30.464 --> 05:32.504
THEY'RE NOT READY
TO SEE YOU AS A MAN,

05:32.533 --> 05:34.033
ESPECIALLY A GAY MAN.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.897
YOU KNOW,
THEY NEED EDUCATING,

05:35.936 --> 05:37.036
SO THEY UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.510
- WHAT ABOUT
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH?

05:39.540 --> 05:43.040
YOU KNOW, HIS FATHER
ALMOST BROKE MY FUCKING RIBS.

05:43.076 --> 05:44.106
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD
HAVE HIM ARRESTED.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.684
- LEAVE IT ALONE.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.983
YOU'VE DONE ENOUGH DAMAGE
TONIGHT.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.946
[whispers]
SHIT.

- MA, ARE YOU OKAY?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.024
- YEAH, I'M FINE, HONEY.

05:55.055 --> 05:56.685
I'M JUST TIRED.

I CAN--I-I-I CAN--
I HAVEN'T LOST MY HEARING.

06:14.975 --> 06:17.875
I JUST LOST MY HAIR.
OH, MICHAEL.

06:17.911 --> 06:20.611
- I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

06:20.648 --> 06:21.948
- NO, I HAVE
TO FINISH MY SHIFT.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.152
- YOUR SHIFT'S OVER, MA.

06:24.184 --> 06:27.154
- I SWALLOWED MY GUM.

06:27.187 --> 06:30.117
MICHAEL,
HELP ME PUT THIS BACK ON.

06:35.563 --> 06:38.833
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?
- I WASN'T.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.026
- OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU NEVER DO.

06:40.067 --> 06:41.967
YOU JUST...ACT.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.802
- I DID
WHAT I HAD TO DO.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.607
- WHAT YOU HAD TO DO?

06:45.639 --> 06:46.909
CRAIG, DO YOU KNOW

06:46.940 --> 06:48.780
HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO LOSING HIM?
WHAT DO YOU DO?

06:48.809 --> 06:50.509
YOU PRACTICALLY
PUSH HIM OUT THE DOOR.

06:50.544 --> 06:53.054
- I TOLD HIM TO COME HOME, JEN.
HE WOULDN'T.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.880
- WHO WOULD,
WITH A LUNATIC?

06:54.915 --> 06:56.175
- LOOK, I'M TRYING
TO PROTECT OUR SON.

06:56.216 --> 06:58.216
- IT'S YOU
HE NEEDS PROTECTION FROM.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.851
NO WONDER
HE'S OUT THERE.

06:59.887 --> 07:02.517
- YEAH, WELL,
HE MADE HIS CHOICE.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.056
- WHAT DID YOU...
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

07:04.091 --> 07:06.531
- I SAID
HE MADE HIS CHOICE, JEN!

07:06.560 --> 07:09.230
I GAVE HIM A CHOICE.
HE MADE IT!

07:09.262 --> 07:11.032

I MEAN IT.

07:21.809 --> 07:23.209
I DON'T WANNA SEE YOU.

07:23.243 --> 07:26.853
- I AM NOT GONNA BE HUMILIATED
BY A BUNCH OF--

ANY CINNAMON TOAST,

07:55.008 --> 07:56.808
AND I DON'T WANT

07:56.844 --> 07:58.714
WHAT I WANT IS YOU ALL
TO STOP MAKING A FUSS OVER ME

07:58.746 --> 08:00.676
AND GO HOME.

08:00.714 --> 08:01.584
YOU ALL HAVE TO BE
AT WORK TOMORROW.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.145
SO DO I.

YOU'RE NOT GOING IN TO WORK.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.845
YOU'RE GONNA STAY HERE
AND TAKE IT EASY.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.517
- I CAN'T AFFORD
TO TAKE IT EASY.

08:09.557 --> 08:10.917
- IT'S NOT GONNA KILL YOU
TO STAY HOME

08:10.958 --> 08:11.988
FOR A DAY OR TWO, DEB.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.995

OF EVERY RECOVERY.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.798
- THANK YOU,
DOOGIE HOWSER.

08:17.831 --> 08:21.171

08:25.238 --> 08:27.678
- SHE'S OKAY. THE DOCTOR SAID
IT'S JUST EXHAUSTION.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.578
THAT'S ALL.
- "JUST EXHAUSTION."

08:30.611 --> 08:33.181
YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TIRED
YOU HAVE TO BE TO FALL OVER?

08:33.212 --> 08:35.323
THAT'S HOW TIRED
YOUR MOTHER IS,

08:35.347 --> 08:38.087
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF ME.
[scoffs]

08:38.118 --> 08:39.948
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:39.986 --> 08:42.886
THINK ABOUT HOW UNHAPPY
SHE'D BE WITHOUT YOU.

08:42.923 --> 08:45.163
- BUT I'M THE REASON
SHE'S PUSHING HERSELF SO HARD,

08:45.192 --> 08:49.032
WORKING DOUBLE SHIFTS...
TO PAY OFF MY DEBTS.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.102
SHE'S EVEN TAKEN OUT
A SECOND MORTGAGE.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.701
- WHAT, ON OUR HOUSE?
- YEAH.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.573
SHE COULDN'T GET MUCH,
BUT SHE DID.

08:54.602 --> 08:55.772
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

08:55.803 --> 08:58.813
- SHE MADE ME
PROMISE NOT TO.

09:02.610 --> 09:04.340
- [sighs]

09:04.377 --> 09:08.217
I'M LUCKY
I STILL HAVE ALL MY TEETH.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.818
AND NO BLACK EYE.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.691
HOW DO I LOOK?

09:12.720 --> 09:15.690
- GREAT.
YOU ALWAYS LOOK GREAT.

09:19.292 --> 09:23.032
I'M SORRY,
FOR MY DAD AND EVERYTHING.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.933

09:51.091 --> 09:54.031
[sighs]
YOU CAN STAY HERE.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.772
ON THE SOFA.

10:17.284 --> 10:19.394
YOU'RE NOT CRYING,
ARE YOU?

10:19.419 --> 10:22.989
- I'M NOT
SOME LITTLE FAGGOT.

10:23.023 --> 10:25.733
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.

10:25.759 --> 10:28.099
YOU'RE PRETTY BRAVE,
ACTUALLY,

10:28.128 --> 10:30.058
STANDING UP TO YOUR FATHER
LIKE THAT.

10:30.097 --> 10:34.667
- HE WAS HURTING YOU.

10:34.702 --> 10:37.642
- GET SOME SLEEP.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.792
[pop music]

10:57.825 --> 11:04.925
*

11:04.965 --> 11:09.865
- * THIS CAN'T BE OVER

11:09.903 --> 11:14.173
* I COULDN'T FACE
THE PAIN *

11:14.207 --> 11:18.077
* SO LET'S JUST
START OVER *

11:18.111 --> 11:22.181
* AGAIN AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN *

11:22.215 --> 11:24.175
*

11:24.217 --> 11:28.857
* YOU KNOW I'M RIGHT

11:28.889 --> 11:33.789
* IF WE NEVER TRY
TO FIND *

11:33.827 --> 11:36.997
* WHAT'S WRONG OR RIGHT

11:37.030 --> 11:42.870
* OUT OF SIGHT,
OUT OF MIND *

11:42.903 --> 11:50.843
*

11:53.046 --> 11:57.816
* YOUR SENSES REELING

11:57.851 --> 12:02.361
* SO HARD TO MAINTAIN

12:02.389 --> 12:06.959
* WELL, I KNOW
WHAT I'M FEELING *

12:06.994 --> 12:10.034
* AGAIN AND AGAIN

12:10.063 --> 12:13.033
* AGAIN
AND AGAIN *

12:13.066 --> 12:14.836
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK,
MIKEY?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.438
- THE JEEP'S ALWAYS HOT.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.069
- WHAT IS HE DOING
AT YOUR PLACE?

12:18.105 --> 12:19.835
- HE HAD
TO STAY SOMEWHERE.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.243
- THE AUDI TT'S
A FUCK MACHINE,

12:22.275 --> 12:24.205
BUT THE GUYS WHO DRIVE IT,
THEY USUALLY AREN'T.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.824
- HIS DAD ALMOST
BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF YOU.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.148
- THE BOXSTER'S SEXY...

12:30.183 --> 12:32.153
IF YOU HAVE
A LITTLE DICK.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.915
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- WHAT DO I THINK?

12:33.954 --> 12:35.224
IT'S OBVIOUS
YOU DON'T CARE

12:35.255 --> 12:36.515
WHAT I THINK
ABOUT YOUR BOY WONDER.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.316
WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE

12:37.357 --> 12:38.857
HOW I FEEL
ABOUT YOUR BATMOBILE?

12:38.892 --> 12:40.332
WHY DON'T YOU GET
THE JEEP FOR MONDAY,

12:40.360 --> 12:42.330
THE AUDI FOR TUESDAY,
AND THE BOXSTER FOR WEDNESDAY?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.962
- HEY!
- WELL, LIKE,

12:43.997 --> 12:45.267
YOU'RE SITTING HERE,
TRYING TO DECIDE

12:45.298 --> 12:46.198
WHAT NEW HOT CAR TO BUY,

12:46.233 --> 12:47.973
AND MY MOM MIGHT LOSE
HER FUCKING HOUSE.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.271
I GOTTA GET TO WORK.

12:50.303 --> 12:53.313
- MICHAEL...

12:53.340 --> 12:55.480
IF YOU NEED MONEY--
- NO.

12:55.508 --> 12:56.538
- LOOK,
I'VE HAD AN AMAZING YEAR.

12:56.576 --> 12:59.506
- THAT'S GREAT,
BUT THANKS ANYWAY.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.006
- I'M OFFERING YOU
A FUCKING GIFT,

13:01.048 --> 13:02.548
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.
- I KNOW.

13:02.582 --> 13:06.422
I JUST CAN'T.
- WHY?

13:06.453 --> 13:08.423
- BECAUSE YOU'RE
ALWAYS THERE FOR ME,

13:08.455 --> 13:10.515
TAKING CARE OF THINGS,

13:10.557 --> 13:12.087
FIGHTING OFF THE BULLIES
AT SCHOOL

13:12.125 --> 13:13.355
AND GIVING ME
THE ANSWERS TO TESTS

13:13.393 --> 13:16.433
AND TAKING ME TO THE HOSPITAL
THE FIRST TIME I GOT GONORRHEA,

13:16.463 --> 13:19.573
AND--

13:19.599 --> 13:22.499
THIS--
THIS IS MY MOM,

13:22.535 --> 13:27.305
AND...THIS IS SOMETHING
I HAVE TO DO FOR HER, BY MYSELF.

13:33.013 --> 13:35.983
- SO MY DAD
TRIED TO BEAT UP BRIAN,

13:36.016 --> 13:38.186
AND DEBBIE ALMOST DIED
IN FRONT OF US,

13:38.218 --> 13:40.388
AND THEN,
I SPENT THE NIGHT AT BRIAN'S.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.320
WHAT'D YOU DO?
- UH...

13:42.355 --> 13:45.325
HAD VEGETARIAN LASAGNA AND READ
A LESSON BEFORE DYING,

13:45.358 --> 13:48.058
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT IT FELT LIKE.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.125
- JUSTIN?

13:49.162 --> 13:52.372
HI, DAPHNE.
- HI.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.274
- BROUGHT YOU YOUR UNIFORM
AND YOUR BOOKS.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.913
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT
THAT ESSAY DUE TODAY.

13:57.938 --> 14:01.138
- TOMORROW.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.144
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:03.176 --> 14:06.076
- I'M FINE.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.453
- I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOU LAST NIGHT.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.220
WHERE WERE YOU?
- WHERE DO YOU THINK?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.620
- JUSTIN, PLEASE WAIT.

14:12.652 --> 14:14.652
I WANT YOU TO COME HOME.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.457
- AFTER WHAT DAD DID?
NO WAY.

14:16.489 --> 14:17.619
- HE--HE GOT CRAZY.

14:17.657 --> 14:18.487
HE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT HE WAS DOING,

14:18.525 --> 14:21.225
BUT WE CAN WORK THIS OUT,
I PROMISE.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.631
- YEAH, DON'T PROMISE.

14:23.663 --> 14:26.303
NOW,
WOULD YOU PLEASE GO?

14:26.333 --> 14:27.373
- DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

14:27.400 --> 14:31.100
- FOR YOU TO GO.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.138
[school bell rings]

14:35.142 --> 14:37.582
- BOO.

14:37.610 --> 14:40.080
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP?

14:40.113 --> 14:42.123
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
TAKING A NAP.

14:42.149 --> 14:44.989
- WELL, NAPS ARE BRIEF.
THAT'S WHY IT'S A SHORT WORD.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.118
HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR MEDS?

14:46.153 --> 14:49.663
- YES, I'VE TAKEN MY MEDS.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.929
- WHAT IS THIS?

14:52.960 --> 14:54.530
"APARTMENTS FOR RENT"?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.201
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING
AT APARTMENTS FOR RENT?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.670
- DON'T GET YOUR TITTIES
IN A TWIST.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.398
- I'M NOT SELLING THE HOUSE,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

15:01.434 --> 15:04.474
- OF COURSE,
YOU'RE NOT SELLING THE HOUSE.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.314
IT'S FOR ME.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.440
I'M THINKING
OF MOVING OUT.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.575
I'M FEELING
MUCH BETTER NOW,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.250
AND WITH MY DISABILITY,
I CAN AFFORD

15:12.279 --> 15:13.379
TO GET A ROOM
SOMEWHERE.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.583
- YOU HAVE A ROOM SOMEWHERE,
HERE.

15:15.615 --> 15:19.045
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO FEEL OBLIGATED!

15:21.488 --> 15:22.558
- OBLIGATED?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.259
YOU KNOW,
YOU ARE COMING THIS CLOSE

15:24.291 --> 15:25.261
TO GETTING PUNCHED OUT.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.292
- YOUR DOCTOR TOLD YOU
NOT TO EXERT YOURSELF.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.197
- WELL, FUCK HIM!

15:28.228 --> 15:29.698
I PUNCHED YOU OUT
WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

15:29.729 --> 15:32.669
AND I CAN
PUNCH YOU OUT NOW.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.713
I WANT SOME SOUP.

15:38.738 --> 15:42.238
- CHICKEN NOODLE?

15:42.275 --> 15:44.205
- YEAH.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.352
[sighs]

15:58.125 --> 15:59.385
WHEN YOU CAME BACK
FROM NEW YORK,

15:59.426 --> 16:02.226
I DIDN'T TAKE YOU IN
'CAUSE I FELT OBLIGATED.

16:02.262 --> 16:06.202
I TOOK YOU IN
'CAUSE I WANTED TO.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.573
HELL, I WOULD DO IT AGAIN.
- OH!

16:08.601 --> 16:10.501
YEAH, LET'S.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.607
THE DEMENTIA,
THE THRUSH...

16:12.639 --> 16:15.239
THE C.M.V.,
THAT WAS A LAUGH AND A HALF.

16:15.275 --> 16:19.145
- I MEAN,
I WANT YOU HERE SICK,

16:19.179 --> 16:22.079
AND I WANT YOU HERE WELL.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.115
I'LL TAKE YOU
ANY WAY I CAN GET YOU.

16:27.554 --> 16:30.594
SO UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA BE
READING THE FUNNIES...

16:30.623 --> 16:34.033
[sniffs]
I'M JUST GONNA TOSS THIS.

16:34.061 --> 16:36.161
WHERE'S MY SOUP?

16:36.196 --> 16:38.766
I'LL SERVE.
I DON'T WANNA GET RUSTY.

16:42.135 --> 16:46.065
- HI. JENNIFER TAYLOR,
JUSTIN'S MOTHER.

16:46.106 --> 16:49.706
OKAY. SO...

16:49.742 --> 16:52.752
I GOT HIS CLOTHES,
A SKETCH PAD,

16:52.779 --> 16:55.419
SHOES, UNDERWEAR,

16:55.448 --> 16:58.548
OH, THE YELLOW SUBMARINE.
IT'S HIS FAVORITE,

16:58.585 --> 17:00.115
HE'S WATCHED IT
A MILLION TIMES.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.753
DID YOU KNOW HE WANTED
TO BE AN ANIMATOR?

17:01.788 --> 17:05.387
- NO, I-I--
- NO, YOU WOULDN'T.

17:05.425 --> 17:08.425
A CHECK, A CHECK.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.601
HERE WE GO.

17:11.631 --> 17:14.231
- FOR WHAT?
- WELL, JUSTIN'S EXPENSIVE.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.537
HE EATS LIKE A FOOTBALL PLAYER,
HE GOES THROUGH CLOTHES

17:15.568 --> 17:16.538
FASTER
THAN I CAN BUY THEM,

17:16.569 --> 17:19.409
AND HE'S ALWAYS NEEDING
SOMETHING FOR SCHOOL.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.539
- YOU THINK
HE'S STAYING WITH ME?

17:20.573 --> 17:22.183
- WHERE ELSE?
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW,

17:22.209 --> 17:24.539
BUT HE'S NOT MOVING
INTO MY PLACE.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.277
- WELL...

17:26.313 --> 17:28.153
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIVE
SOMEWHERE,

17:28.181 --> 17:30.151
SINCE HE TOLD ME
HE'S NEVER COMING HOME AGAIN.

17:30.183 --> 17:32.293
- WHY DO YOU CARE
WHAT HE SAYS?

17:32.319 --> 17:34.489
YOU'RE HIS MOTHER.
COME AND GET HIM.

17:34.521 --> 17:38.291
- IF I CAME AND GOT HIM,
HE WOULD JUST, UH, RUN AWAY,

17:38.325 --> 17:40.685
AND I MIGHT NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.457
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS
TO RUNAWAY KIDS, MR. KINNEY?

17:43.496 --> 17:44.756
- THEY END UP
ON MILK CARTONS.

17:44.797 --> 17:47.227
- OR WORSE.

17:47.267 --> 17:52.437
AT LEAST WITH YOU...
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.842
- HE'S NOT
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

17:54.874 --> 17:57.484
- OH, YES, HE IS.

17:57.510 --> 18:00.380
YOU SEDUCED HIM, YOU S--
FUCKED HIM,

18:00.413 --> 18:02.283
SO NOW HE'S YOURS.

18:02.315 --> 18:06.185
JUST KINDLY, SEE THAT
HE TAKES HIS ALLERGY MEDICINE

18:06.219 --> 18:07.849
AND, UH...

18:07.887 --> 18:11.487
AND DOES HIS HOMEWORK
AND GETS TO SCHOOL ON TIME.

18:13.893 --> 18:17.463
AND...

18:17.497 --> 18:20.797
AND TELL HIM
THAT WE LOVE HIM.

18:30.510 --> 18:35.380
- * RIDI, PAGLIACCIO *

18:35.415 --> 18:37.545
- HEY, BOB.
YOU SOUND GREAT.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.824
- OH, THANKS, MIKE.
[chuckles]

18:38.851 --> 18:40.491
I DIDN'T REALIZE
I HAD AN AUDIENCE.

18:40.520 --> 18:41.850
- YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN
AN OPERA SINGER.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.688
- WELL, I WANTED
TO BE ONE ONCE,

18:43.723 --> 18:45.393
BUT THEN I HAD TO MAKE
A CHOICE.

18:45.425 --> 18:48.425
THE MET,
OR THE BIG "Q."

18:48.461 --> 18:50.331
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S PAYING OFF.

18:50.363 --> 18:51.433
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE PROMOTION.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.374
- OH, THANKS.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.500
DISTRICT MANAGER.
BIG RESPONSIBILITY.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.335
- I BET. HAVE YOU, UH,
PICKED YOUR REPLACEMENT YET?

18:58.371 --> 18:59.771
- OH, NO, NO, NO.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.366
COUPLE OF PEOPLE
HAVE EXPRESSED SOME INTEREST,

19:01.408 --> 19:04.308
YOU KNOW.
- YEAH, I KNOW. UM...

19:04.344 --> 19:05.484
I HOPE
YOU WOULDN'T MIND,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.582
I'D LIKE TO TOSS MY HAT
IN THE RING.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.584
- WELL, SURE, MIKE.
SURE.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.687
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
I NEVER REALLY HAD YOU PEGGED

19:12.719 --> 19:14.589
FOR THE AMBITIOUS TYPE.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.621
- WELL, I'VE ALWAYS
BEEN FOCUSED ON MY JOB,

19:17.657 --> 19:19.627
YOU KNOW,
DOING IT WELL.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.389
A PROMOTION SHOULDN'T BE
ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME,

19:21.428 --> 19:22.658
BUT WHAT'S GOOD
FOR THE COMPANY.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.795
- WELL, YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
MIKE?

19:24.831 --> 19:28.501
A LOT OF PEOPLE
DO NOT FEEL THAT WAY.

19:28.535 --> 19:33.365
MOSTLY, THEY'RE JUST KIND OF
IN IT FOR THEMSELVES, YOU KNOW?

19:33.406 --> 19:35.336
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.875
THEY'RE HAVING
A LITTLE CONGRATULATION DINNER

19:36.909 --> 19:39.549
FOR ME TOMORROW NIGHT,
OVER AT DOMINIC'S.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.379
- MM-HMM.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.424
- WHY DON'T YOU
COME ALONG?

19:43.450 --> 19:45.850
- WOW! THANKS, BOB.
THAT'D BE GREAT.

19:45.885 --> 19:50.585
- OKAY.
AND, UH, BRING YOUR LADY.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.232
- HE WANTS ME
TO BRING MY LADY.

19:54.261 --> 19:57.231
- STRAIGHT GUYS REALLY SAY
THINGS LIKE "BRING YOUR LADY"?

19:57.264 --> 19:58.674
- THEY SAY WORSE
THAN THAT.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.768
- I DON'T HAVE A LADY.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.569
- NO, YOU HAVE
SOMETHING BETTER,

20:01.601 --> 20:03.671
DR. DREAMBOAT.
- [chuckles]

20:03.703 --> 20:05.873
- WELL, I CAN FIX YOU UP
WITH MY SISTER...

20:05.905 --> 20:08.275
ONLY SHE LOOKS LIKE ME
IN A DRESS.

20:08.308 --> 20:11.238
- [laughs] OKAY,
THAT'S A TERRIFYING THOUGHT.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.848
- OR MAYBE EMMETT COULD DRESS UP
LIKE HE DID LAST HALLOWEEN.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.580
- NO, EMMETT COULD NOT.

20:16.616 --> 20:17.646
BESIDES,
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN

20:17.684 --> 20:19.824
THAT YOU'RE DATING
REBA MCENTIRE?

20:19.852 --> 20:21.892
- EASIER THAN EXPLAINING
I'M A FAG.

20:21.921 --> 20:24.521
- SO TELL THEM
THE TRUTH ALREADY!

20:24.557 --> 20:27.457
- YOU SAID THAT HE'S A NICE GUY,
THAT HE LIKES YOU.

20:27.494 --> 20:31.604
- YEAH, UNTIL I GIVE HIM
A REASON NOT TO.

20:31.631 --> 20:35.841
THERE'S THIS WOMAN
WHO WORKS IN SHIPPING, HELGA.

20:35.868 --> 20:38.808
BIG, SHORT-CROPPED HAIR,
DRIVES A PICKUP.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.308
- [laughs]
- SHE'S BEEN WORKING THERE

20:40.340 --> 20:42.480
15 YEARS.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.809
EVERY YEAR, SHE GETS
PASSED OVER FOR A PROMOTION

20:44.844 --> 20:47.414
BY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THERE
ONE YEAR, TWO YEARS.

20:47.447 --> 20:50.347
EVERYBODY KNOWS WHY,
NOBODY SAYS ANYTHING,

20:50.383 --> 20:53.753
SO SHE'S STILL SITTING THERE,
DOING INVOICES.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.986
I CAN'T AFFORD
TO LET THAT HAPPEN TO ME. I--

20:56.022 --> 20:58.462
15 YEARS FROM NOW,
I CAN'T STILL BE DOING INVENTORY

20:58.491 --> 21:00.591
AND DIRECTING SHOPPERS
TO OUR SUPER SALE

21:00.627 --> 21:02.597
ON BACKYARD BARBECUES.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.427

21:07.467 --> 21:08.867

21:08.901 --> 21:10.901
- I KNOW YOU'RE THERE,
PICK UP.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.767
- WHOO!

21:12.805 --> 21:14.305

21:14.341 --> 21:16.441
[dance music

21:16.476 --> 21:18.906
- * MY BABY!

21:18.945 --> 21:20.905
WHOO!

21:23.516 --> 21:24.916

21:24.951 --> 21:26.691
- HUH?

21:26.719 --> 21:30.619
- UH, LISTENING TO MOBY.

21:30.657 --> 21:34.587
IT'S REALLY HOT.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.327
SO--
[chuckles]

21:37.364 --> 21:39.804
WHASSUP?

21:39.832 --> 21:43.442
- "WHASSUP" IS
YOU LEFT MY DOOR UNLOCKED.

21:43.470 --> 21:46.070
"WHASSUP" IS THIS IS
NOT A HOTEL ROOM,

21:46.105 --> 21:49.405
AND YOU'RE NOT
ON YOUR BLONDE AMBITION TOUR.

21:49.442 --> 21:51.482
"WHASSUP"

21:51.511 --> 21:56.851
IS YOUR MOTHER
PAID ME A LITTLE VISIT TODAY.

21:56.883 --> 22:00.923
FINALLY, "WHASSUP" IS
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE OFF MY SHIRT

22:00.953 --> 22:03.363
AND CLEAN UP YOUR SHIT.

22:03.390 --> 22:06.560
[kicks object]

22:06.593 --> 22:09.103
AND ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS COME HOME

22:09.128 --> 22:10.958
AND HAVE SOMETHING
TO EAT.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.797
- I COULD MAKE YOU SOMETHING.
- MM.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.703
NO, YOU COULDN'T.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.867
- I'M SORRY I'M IN YOUR WAY.
- NOT AS SORRY AS I AM.

22:19.906 --> 22:21.366
- I DIDN'T MEAN FOR IT
TO HAPPEN.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.438
- WELL, IT DID.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.106
- SO?

22:25.144 --> 22:29.684
AS LONG AS WE'RE TOGETHER,
WE MIGHT AS WELL--

22:29.716 --> 22:31.576
- [scoffs]

22:31.618 --> 22:36.588
WE ARE NOT...TOGETHER.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.693
YOU'RE HERE
AS THE RESULT

22:38.725 --> 22:42.995
OF A SERIES
OF UNFORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCES

22:43.029 --> 22:46.729
WHICH HAVE GIVEN ME
THE WORST HEADACHE IN MY LIFE

22:46.766 --> 22:49.466
AND A DUFFEL BAG...

22:49.502 --> 22:50.672
FULL...

22:50.703 --> 22:53.643
OF YOUR FUCKING UNDERWEAR.

22:56.576 --> 23:00.076
NOW, I'M GOING TO BED.

23:00.112 --> 23:02.422
- OKAY.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.679
- ALONE.

23:04.717 --> 23:08.017
YOU GO OVER THERE
AND DO YOUR HOMEWORK,

23:08.054 --> 23:10.094
AND LIGHTS OUT BY 11:00.

23:10.122 --> 23:13.492
- 11:00?
[scoffs]

23:13.526 --> 23:15.456
- DO YOU KNOW THAT
I HAD TO PROMISE YOUR MOTHER

23:15.495 --> 23:18.425
THAT YOU WOULDN'T BE LATE
FOR SCHOOL TOMORROW?

23:22.068 --> 23:23.868
AND BY THE WAY,

23:23.903 --> 23:28.173
SHE SENDS HER LOVE.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.786
- OH, NO. NO, NO.
- VIC!

23:38.818 --> 23:40.788
LISTEN TO ME.
GET AWAY FROM THAT DOOR!

23:40.820 --> 23:43.160
GET OUT OF THOSE CLOTHES
AND BACK IN YOUR MUUMUU.

23:43.189 --> 23:44.989
IF I HAVE TO WATCH
MARTHA STEWART

23:45.024 --> 23:47.064
MAKE ONE MORE GODDAMN THING
OUT OF GOAT CHEESE,

23:47.093 --> 23:48.063
I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF.

23:48.094 --> 23:52.534
- AMC HAS A JOAN CRAWFORD
FESTIVAL ALL WEEK.

23:52.565 --> 23:55.065
- NOBODY'S THAT GAY.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.241
I GOT TO GO TO WORK.
THEY NEED ME.

23:58.270 --> 24:00.110
- AND YOU NEED
TO REST YOUR ASS!

24:00.139 --> 24:02.169
COME ON!
- HI, HONEY.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.008
[chuckles]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:04.043 --> 24:07.913
- UNCLE VIC ASKED ME TO BRING
SOME ROPE TO TIE YOU DOWN.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.617
- KINKY.

24:09.649 --> 24:12.219
YOU WANT SOME EGGS?
YOU'RE GETTING EGGS.

24:12.251 --> 24:14.251
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING
WITH MY HANDS.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.956
- I WANT YOU TO STAND STILL
AND LISTEN TO ME.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.559
- DO YOU WANT TOMATOES
WITH THOSE?

24:18.591 --> 24:20.731
- MOM, WILL YOU LISTEN
TO ME?

24:20.760 --> 24:23.730
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.567
I'M UP FOR A PROMOTION
AT WORK.

24:28.601 --> 24:31.001
- SWEETIE, THAT'S GREAT!
- I DON'T HAVE IT YET.

24:31.037 --> 24:33.637
I MAY NOT GET IT EVER,

24:33.673 --> 24:37.143
BUT EITHER WAY,
I'M MAKING SOME CHANGES.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.776
- YOU'RE NOT GOING STRAIGHT,
ARE YOU?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.511
- VIC, SHUSH.

24:40.547 --> 24:44.547
- I KNOW HOW HARD
YOU WORK.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.994
YOU ALWAYS HAVE TAKEN CARE OF ME
ALL BY YOURSELF,

24:48.020 --> 24:50.190
NOBODY TO HELP YOU,

24:50.222 --> 24:52.992
AND I'VE NEVER
DONE ANYTHING FOR YOU.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.025
- THAT IS NOT TRUE.

24:55.061 --> 24:57.001
- NOW, IT'S MY TURN
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU,

24:57.029 --> 25:00.029
AND I WILL.
I SWEAR.

25:00.066 --> 25:02.566
- BABY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TAKE CARE OF ME.

25:02.602 --> 25:05.742
YOU ALREADY DO SO MUCH.

25:05.772 --> 25:09.912
- WELL,
I WANNA DO MORE.

25:09.942 --> 25:14.912
NOW, WILL YOU STAY HOME
AND TRY AND GET A LITTLE REST?

25:26.659 --> 25:30.199
[door opens, closes]

25:30.229 --> 25:33.069
- THAT'S MY HERO.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.669
[indistinct chatter]

25:35.702 --> 25:37.772
[baby coos]

25:37.804 --> 25:40.174
- GUS APPROVES.

25:40.206 --> 25:43.206
- YEAH, HE'S NOT BAD.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.907
- OF THE CAR.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.616
HE THINKS IT'S YOU.

25:48.648 --> 25:49.878
I BET JUSTIN
WILL LIKE IT TOO,

25:49.916 --> 25:52.116
DRIVING AROUND
WITH HIS SUGAR DADDY.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.751
- I AM NOT HIS SUGAR DADDY,
AND WOULD YOU PLEASE

25:53.786 --> 25:55.146
LEAVE HIM OUT OF THIS?

25:55.187 --> 25:58.287
- WOW, BEAUTIFUL BABY.
LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.594
- WHY, THANK YOU.
SO DO OUR FIVE OTHERS.

26:00.627 --> 26:02.857
I'M GONNA GO CHANGE HIM,
HONEY.

26:02.895 --> 26:04.925
- YOU DO THAT, SWEETIE.

26:04.964 --> 26:05.804
- WHERE'S THE LADIES' ROOM?

26:05.832 --> 26:08.802
- UH,
JUST AROUND THE CORNER THERE.

26:08.835 --> 26:10.165
BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.872
UH, YOU'VE HAD YOUR EYE
ON THIS ONE.

26:11.904 --> 26:13.774
- YEAH, I NOTICED
IT COMES FULLY LOADED.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.076
- [chuckles]
YOU NAME IT, IT'S ON IT.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.338
- SERVICE DEPARTMENT,
LINE TWO.

26:18.377 --> 26:21.277
SERVICE DEPARTMENT,
PICK UP.

26:21.313 --> 26:24.023
- ONLY YOU DON'T
REALLY WANT THIS.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.050
- I DON'T?

26:25.084 --> 26:27.094
- FAGS DRIVE IT.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.859
I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS,

26:28.888 --> 26:31.358
BUT THEY'RE ATTRACTED TO IT
LIKE FLIES.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.990
NICE COUPLE LIKE YOU?

26:33.025 --> 26:36.955
YOU WANNA BE
IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.798
- I APPRECIATE THE WARNING...
- [chuckles]

26:40.833 --> 26:42.333
- BUT I'M STILL--
I'M CURIOUS.

26:42.368 --> 26:44.768
DO YOU THINK I COULD
TAKE ONE FOR A TEST DRIVE?

26:44.804 --> 26:46.214
- [scoffs]
- AND THEN,

26:46.238 --> 26:48.978
I'LL TRY ONE OF THE, UH,
STRAIGHTER MODELS.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.938
- GREAT IDEA.

27:00.887 --> 27:03.157
[tires screeching]
[engine revving]

27:20.439 --> 27:23.209
- SO, HONEY,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:28.047 --> 27:30.777
- HMM.

27:30.817 --> 27:33.317
- WE'LL TAKE IT.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.257
- MMM.
- GOD, YOU'RE TIGHT.

27:37.289 --> 27:40.029
- THANKS.
- [laughs]

27:40.059 --> 27:42.999
I MEANT YOUR BACK.
YOU GOT A LOT OF TENSION.

27:43.029 --> 27:44.829
- AHH. OH.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.774
[phone ringing]

27:46.799 --> 27:49.769
- [scoffs]
BRIAN.

27:49.802 --> 27:52.872
- YEAH. HI.

27:52.905 --> 27:55.835
UH, HOW ABOUT I PICK YOU UP
AROUND 7:00?

27:58.477 --> 28:02.207
UH-HUH. YEAH, ME TOO.
IT'LL BE FUN.

28:02.248 --> 28:04.248
MM-HMM.

28:04.283 --> 28:06.793
OKAY. BYE.
[chuckles]

28:06.819 --> 28:08.049
- WHO WAS THAT?

28:08.087 --> 28:09.987
- TRACY,
FROM THE STORE.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.362
- OH. GIRL THAT HAS
A CRUSH ON YOU.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.731
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE A CRUSH
ON ME, SHE LIKES ME.

28:14.761 --> 28:16.061
I LIKE HER.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.325
- BUT NOT
IN THE SAME WAY.

28:17.363 --> 28:20.803
- I INVITED HER TO GO WITH ME
TO BOB'S PARTY.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.843
- REALLY? AS YOUR DATE?
- NO!

28:22.869 --> 28:26.309
WELL, YEAH.
BUT NO!

28:26.338 --> 28:27.738
- WELL, THAT'S CLEAR.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.184
HAVE A GREAT TIME.
- OW!

28:30.209 --> 28:33.349
LOOK, YOU KNOW I CAN'T ASK YOU,
AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE TO.

28:33.379 --> 28:36.319
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
- REALLY?

28:36.348 --> 28:39.448
- IT'S JUST...
I'M SUPPOSED TO BRING "MY LADY."

28:39.485 --> 28:41.245
- DOES TRACY KNOW
WHY YOU'RE ASKING HER?

28:41.287 --> 28:42.817
- I COULDN'T
TELL HER THAT.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.855
- WELL, DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S FAIR, CONSIDERING

28:44.891 --> 28:46.831
SHE'S GOING THERE THINKING
THAT SHE'S "YOUR LADY"?

28:46.859 --> 28:48.089
- HOW DO I KNOW
WHAT SHE THINKS?

28:48.127 --> 28:49.357
BESIDES,
IT'S NOT A DATE DATE.

28:49.395 --> 28:52.325
IT'S A PARTY FOR THE BOSS.
IT'S BUSINESS.

28:52.364 --> 28:56.304
CHRIST, I WISH EVERYBODY
WOULD JUST GET OFF MY BACK!

28:56.335 --> 29:00.265
- FINE, I WILL.
- I--HEY, I'M SORRY.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.466
I DIDN'T MEAN--

29:01.507 --> 29:04.837
WHAT THE HELL ELSE
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

29:04.877 --> 29:07.977
- MICHAEL, I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
THIS PROMOTION IS TO YOU,

29:08.014 --> 29:10.084
BUT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS NOT RIGHT.

29:10.116 --> 29:12.246
IT'S NOT FAIR TO TRACY
OR TO YOURSELF.

29:12.284 --> 29:15.864
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW,
I'VE LIVED IT,

29:15.888 --> 29:18.188
THE DECEIT
BUT ALWAYS WITH A GOOD REASON.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.494
THE ONLY THING IS, IS THAT
THERE'S NEVER A GOOD REASON.

29:20.526 --> 29:23.156
THERE'S ONLY
THE HURT THAT YOU CAUSE.

29:23.195 --> 29:25.965
THAT IS WHY
YOU HAVE TO TELL THE TRUTH.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.838
- "TELL THE TRUTH..."

29:28.868 --> 29:30.968
WHICH YOU CAN AFFORD
TO DO.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.343
BUT I CAN'T.

29:32.371 --> 29:34.971
I DON'T HAVE AN OFFICE
AND A DIPLOMA

29:35.007 --> 29:38.537
AND "NOTHING AVAILABLE
TILL FOUR WEEKS FROM TUESDAY."

29:38.577 --> 29:40.147
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
MY OWN BATHROOM,

29:40.179 --> 29:42.479
BUT I DO KNOW
THAT IF I JUST TELL THE TRUTH,

29:42.514 --> 29:45.454
I PROBABLY NEVER WILL.

29:47.453 --> 29:50.993
- I CAN'T BELIEVE HIS MOM
ACTUALLY BROUGHT YOU HIS STUFF.

29:51.023 --> 29:53.333
- YEAH, SHE PRACTICALLY
MADE A GIFT OUT OF HIM.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.559
- GIFTS CAN BE RETURNED.

29:54.593 --> 29:55.863
- I JUST WANT HIM
OUT OF MY LIFE

29:55.895 --> 29:58.395
AND OUT OF MY HOUSE.

30:05.171 --> 30:06.911
HAVE EITHER ONE OF YOU
EVER BEEN TO ATLANTA?

30:06.939 --> 30:10.839
- NO. BUT I HAD A BOYFRIEND
FROM GEORGIA ONCE.

30:10.877 --> 30:11.977
I-I CALLED HIM
"PEACH FUZZ."

30:12.011 --> 30:13.451
BET YOU CAN'T GUESS WHY.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.449
- BECAUSE HIS BUTT CHEEKS
WERE COVERED

30:14.480 --> 30:15.550
WITH THIS SOFT,
FUZZY DOWN

30:15.581 --> 30:18.051
THAT LOOKED LIKE
TWO GEORGIA PEACHES.

30:18.084 --> 30:21.094
- YEAH.

30:23.890 --> 30:26.030
- WELL, I THINK I'M GONNA
GO SHOW OUR GUEST

30:26.058 --> 30:28.228
SOME, UH,
NORTHERN HOSPITALITY.

30:28.260 --> 30:31.230
[smooth dance music]

30:31.263 --> 30:39.243
*

30:52.118 --> 30:53.088
- [breathing hard]

30:53.119 --> 30:54.089
- OOH!
- OH.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.350
- OOH.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

30:55.387 --> 31:00.357
- [chuckles]
IT'S A LONG STORY.

31:00.392 --> 31:02.332
- NOW, HURRY UP
AND OPEN THAT DOOR.

31:02.361 --> 31:04.401
I CAN'T WAIT.

31:04.430 --> 31:08.370
- BE PATIENT.
THE SOUTH WILL RISE AGAIN.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.200
AND AGAIN.

31:10.236 --> 31:12.496
- WHOA!
[clatter]

31:12.538 --> 31:16.238
OH, SHIT.

31:16.275 --> 31:19.075
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?

31:19.111 --> 31:20.411
- I MADE DINNER.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.606
I HAD SALAD,
BUT I DROPPED IT.

31:21.647 --> 31:23.117
- YEAH,
YOU MADE A FUCKING MESS.

31:23.149 --> 31:27.049
- I'LL CLEAN IT UP,
DON'T WORRY.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.056
WHO'S HE?

31:29.088 --> 31:31.288
- HE'S AN OUT-OF-TOWN GUEST.

31:31.323 --> 31:36.003
- MMM, WHAT YOU MAKING?
SMELLS GOOD.

31:36.028 --> 31:38.328
- JAMBALAYA.
MY MOM TAUGHT ME.

31:38.364 --> 31:39.434
EXCEPT IT'S SORT OF
INSTANT JAMBALAYA

31:39.465 --> 31:44.035
BECAUSE I USED, UH,
FROZEN SHRIMP AND MINUTE RICE.

31:44.070 --> 31:45.600
I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW MUCH RICE TO USE,

31:45.637 --> 31:48.037
AND THE WATER FOR THE SHRIMP
OVERFLOWED A LITTLE BIT.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.444
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.306
YOU KNOW, I USED TO LIVE
IN NEW ORLEANS.

31:52.344 --> 31:55.084
MY BOYFRIEND AND I,
WE MADE JAMBALAYA ALL THE TIME.

31:55.114 --> 31:59.154
WE'D JUST COOK AND FUCK.
[chuckles]

31:59.185 --> 32:01.145
SO YOU GOT A SPOON?

32:07.526 --> 32:10.626
MMM. IT'S NOT BAD.

32:10.662 --> 32:12.202
BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU NEED?

32:12.231 --> 32:14.371
JUST AN ITSY-BITSY PINCH
OF CAYENNE PEPPER.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.470
THAT'S WHAT'LL GIVE IT
THAT EXTRA SPECIAL KICK.

32:16.502 --> 32:21.212
- HE'S GONNA GET
AN EXTRA SPECIAL KICK...LATER.

32:21.240 --> 32:22.210
[Southern accent]
NOW, YOU CAN EITHER STAND

32:22.241 --> 32:23.381
AROUND HERE EATING JAMBALAYA,

32:23.409 --> 32:26.349
OR YOU CAN COME UPSTAIRS

32:30.016 --> 32:33.016
[footsteps departing]

32:45.264 --> 32:46.734

32:46.765 --> 32:49.435
WELL...

WELL, MAYBE WE CAN HAVE
SOME OF THIS AFTER, HMM?

32:52.771 --> 32:54.711
- YEAH.

32:54.740 --> 32:56.580
MY MOM SAYS IT'S ALWAYS BETTER
THE SECOND DAY.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.538

33:46.458 --> 33:48.528

TRACY.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.400
- THANKS FOR INVITING ME.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.299
- * BACIAMI AMORE *

33:53.332 --> 33:54.732
- MICHAEL!

33:54.766 --> 33:57.066
- HEY, BOB!
- GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT, HUH?

33:57.103 --> 33:58.543
- YOU KNOW TRACY?
- SURE!

33:58.570 --> 34:00.170
SURE, ALTHOUGH, UH,
I DIDN'T KNOW

34:00.206 --> 34:01.666
YOU TWO WERE AN ITEM,
THOUGH.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.677
UH, CAREFUL.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.839
DON'T LET THE BOSS
CATCH YOU FRATERNIZING, HUH?

34:05.877 --> 34:08.206
[laughter]

34:08.246 --> 34:10.417
LISTEN, I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY WIFE. HONEY.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.518
BETTY, HONEY, COME HERE.
- MM, MM.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.091
COMING.
[giggles]

34:14.120 --> 34:15.690
- BETTY, I WANT YOU TO MEET
MIKE NOVOTNY.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.291
HE'S ONE
OF OUR ASSISTANT MANAGERS.

34:17.322 --> 34:21.233
- OH, MIKE!
OH, IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.699
- SAME HERE, MRS. BARBAROSA.
- BETTY. CALL ME BETTY.

34:24.730 --> 34:27.630
OH, AND THIS MUST BE
YOUR ADORABLE WIFE.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.795
[giggles]
- NOT EXACTLY. I MEAN--

34:29.835 --> 34:32.495
- WAIT, HONEY, COME ON.
GIVE THEM SOME TIME, WILL YA?

34:32.538 --> 34:34.208
THEY'RE STILL WORKING ON IT,
YOU KNOW?

34:34.239 --> 34:36.239
PROBABLY NEED TO PUT SOME MONEY
IN THE BANK FIRST, RIGHT?

34:36.275 --> 34:38.705
- OH, WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN
HELP THEM WITH THAT.

34:38.744 --> 34:40.184
- B-BETTY,
COME ON, NOW,

34:40.212 --> 34:41.282
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I GOTTA TELL YOU,

34:41.313 --> 34:43.322
BUSINESS IS BUSIN--
- OH, WHEN IT COMES TO BUSINESS,

34:43.349 --> 34:45.248
I DON'T OPEN MY MOUTH.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.324
THAT'S STRICTLY YOUR DOMAIN,
SWEETHEART.

34:47.353 --> 34:48.523
- THANK YOU.
- BUT WE KNOW

34:48.554 --> 34:50.393
WHO'S REALLY RUNNING THE SHOW,
DON'T WE?

34:50.422 --> 34:52.422
[laughter]
- YOO-HOO! BETTY?

34:52.458 --> 34:53.487
- OH, LOOK!

34:53.525 --> 34:54.725
THERE'S, UH, GEORGE AND HELEN.
HI!

34:54.760 --> 34:56.159

34:56.195 --> 34:57.525
- YEAH. THANK GOD.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.533
- HELLO, GEORGIE!

35:00.566 --> 35:03.166
[laughter]

35:03.202 --> 35:04.442
- SHE THOUGHT
WE WERE MARRIED.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.340
- YEAH.
HOW 'BOUT THAT?

35:07.373 --> 35:10.813
[chuckles]
- AND IT'S ONLY OUR FIRST DATE.

35:10.842 --> 35:13.612
I MEAN, IF THIS IS A DATE.
- CAN I GET YOU A DRINK?

35:13.645 --> 35:14.775
- OH, SURE.

35:14.813 --> 35:17.183
- UM, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

35:17.216 --> 35:19.616
- UM, WHATEVER
YOU'RE HAVING.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.251
I JUST--
I WANNA USE THE LADIES' ROOM.

35:21.287 --> 35:23.487
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

35:23.522 --> 35:26.432
- THEY'RE MARKED, UH,
"SIGNORE" AND "SIGNORA."

35:26.458 --> 35:29.398
[laughs]
- [laughs]

35:35.434 --> 35:36.874
- HEY, MIKE.

35:36.902 --> 35:38.702
- HI, ANDREW.
- THIS IS MY WIFE.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.337
- OH.

35:40.372 --> 35:41.572
OH, I'M SORRY.
- NICE TO MEET YOU. I'M SORRY.

35:41.607 --> 35:43.677
- I SEE YOU BROUGHT TRACY.
- YEAH.

35:43.709 --> 35:45.939
- I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TWO WERE GOING OUT.

35:45.977 --> 35:47.647
- WELL, WE LIKE
TO KEEP IT DISCREET,

35:47.679 --> 35:48.649
YOU KNOW,
SINCE WE WORK TOGETHER.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.880
- SMART IDEA,
CONSIDERING THE WAY RUMORS FLY.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.046
- [chuckles]
YOU'RE TELLING ME.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.523
- IN FACT, YOU SHOULD HEAR
SOME OF THE ONES ABOUT YOU.

35:54.553 --> 35:55.853
- LIKE WHAT?

35:55.887 --> 36:00.257
- NOTHING
I'D WANT TO REPEAT.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.332
BUT THE KIND OF THING
THAT COULD REALLY

36:01.360 --> 36:03.400
HURT SOMEONE'S CHANCES.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.799
ESPECIALLY IF THEY
WERE LOOKING FOR A PROMOTION.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.331
- OH.

36:07.366 --> 36:09.366
- THERE'S MY GIRL.
- THANKS.

36:09.401 --> 36:11.571
- TRACY, HAVE YOU MET
ANDREW'S WIFE, LIZ?

36:11.603 --> 36:14.643
- NO, HI.
- HI.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.651
- [clears throat]

36:23.549 --> 36:25.249
- OH--MMM.

36:27.953 --> 36:29.893
MMM.

36:34.726 --> 36:37.396
MMM, MMM.

36:37.429 --> 36:38.529
- [sniffs]

36:38.564 --> 36:40.704
[groans]

36:40.732 --> 36:43.402
- AH, MORNING, JUSTIN.
HOW'D YOU SLEEP?

36:43.435 --> 36:46.435
- [groans] OKAY.

36:46.472 --> 36:47.742
IT'S A LITTLE LUMPY.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.583
- OH.
- COME HAVE SOME BREAKFAST.

36:49.608 --> 36:51.738
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.
- GOTTA EAT SOMETHING.

36:51.777 --> 36:52.907
YOU'RE A GROWING BOY.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.314
OH, JESUS, DID I JUST SAY THAT?
- [laughs]

36:55.347 --> 36:56.577
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO WASH THE SHEETS?

36:56.615 --> 36:57.975
- OH, THAT'S OKAY.
- BUT IF YOU'D LIKE,

36:58.016 --> 37:00.786
YOU COULD WASH MY CAR.
- [laughs]

37:00.819 --> 37:02.589
- [laughs]

37:02.621 --> 37:04.621
- I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR LETTING ME STAY HERE.

37:04.656 --> 37:05.856
- HEY,
IT'S NO TROUBLE.

37:05.891 --> 37:07.391
YOU CAN COME ANYTIME.
RIGHT, MEL?

37:07.426 --> 37:10.356
- MMM, ANYTIME.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.730
- [scoffs]
HE HATES ME.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.265
- HE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.471
- YES, HE DOES,
AND SO DOES MY DAD.

37:18.504 --> 37:21.344
I PULLED HIM OFF BRIAN,
AND I HIT HIM,

37:21.373 --> 37:22.873
AND NOW,
I CAN'T EVEN GO HOME.

37:22.908 --> 37:24.738
- OH, SWEETIE,
IT'S OKAY.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.606
- DON'T SAY IT'S OKAY,

37:26.645 --> 37:28.345
AND DON'T SAY ANYTHING BAD
ABOUT BRIAN EITHER.

37:28.380 --> 37:30.750
- WELL, THAT DOESN'T LEAVE
MUCH ROOM FOR CONVERSATION.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.392
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

37:33.419 --> 37:36.359
OH, WHAT AM I
GONNA DO?

37:36.388 --> 37:38.488
- OH.
- [sniffs]

37:38.524 --> 37:39.964
- YOU'RE GOING TO DO
ONE THING

37:39.991 --> 37:41.491
AT A TIME.
- RIGHT.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.727
- FIRST, YOU'RE GONNA
TAKE A SHOWER.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.831
- THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE BREAKFAST.

37:43.862 --> 37:46.502
- THEN YOU'RE GOING
TO SCHOOL, OKAY?

37:46.532 --> 37:49.942
- [chuckles]
- NOW GO.

37:56.675 --> 37:58.775
- PHEW.
- POOR GUY.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.380
- GOD.

38:01.413 --> 38:03.453
AND STILL, HE DEFENDS
THAT FUCKING PRICK.

38:03.482 --> 38:06.522
YOU KNOW, IT AMAZES ME--
- DON'T START.

38:06.552 --> 38:09.322
ALLOW ME.

38:09.355 --> 38:10.415
[clears throat]

38:10.456 --> 38:12.416
[dialing]

38:15.394 --> 38:19.774
BRI? IT'S LINDS.
DID I WAKE YOU?

38:19.798 --> 38:20.998
GOOD.

38:21.032 --> 38:24.642
- [whispering] APOLOGIZE FOR
MAKING YOU BELIEVE OTHERWISE,

38:24.670 --> 38:26.610
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT SHOULD AFFECT MY ABILITY

38:26.638 --> 38:28.838
TO DO MY JOB...
[muttering]

38:28.874 --> 38:30.544
- HI, MIKE.

38:30.576 --> 38:33.806
- HEY, BOB.
THANKS AGAIN FOR INVITING ME--

38:33.845 --> 38:35.675
I MEAN, US, TO THE PARTY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

38:35.714 --> 38:36.954
WE HAD A GREAT TIME.
- HEY, LISTEN.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.422
BETTY WAS CRAZY
ABOUT YOU.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.420
ALL SHE WANTS
TO KNOW IS,

38:39.451 --> 38:42.851
WHEN ARE YOU AND TRACY
GETTING HITCHED, HUH?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.558
- LISTEN, BOB, THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT--

38:44.590 --> 38:46.960
- THAT TRACY,
SHE'S A REAL PRETTY GIRL.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.432
SHE'S WHAT WE USED TO CALL
A FOX.

38:49.461 --> 38:50.931
YOU GUYS STILL USE
THAT WORD, A FOX?

38:50.962 --> 38:54.072
- YEAH,
WE STILL USE THAT WORD.

38:54.099 --> 38:55.829
- UH, DO YOU KNOW
IF SHE'S BUSY TONIGHT?

38:55.867 --> 38:56.897
- EXCUSE ME?

38:56.935 --> 38:59.665
- WELL, 'CAUSE YOU MIGHT,
UH, YOU MIGHT WANNA HAVE

38:59.705 --> 39:03.105
A LITTLE CELEBRATION
OF YOUR OWN.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.941
WELL, AFTER ALL,
ISN'T THAT WHAT YOU DO

39:04.976 --> 39:07.776
WHEN YOU GET A PROMOTION,
MR. MANAGER!

39:07.813 --> 39:09.953
[laughter and cheering]

39:09.981 --> 39:13.891
[chatter and applause]

39:13.919 --> 39:17.519
WAY TO GO, BUDDY.
CONGRATULATIONS, BUDDY.

39:17.556 --> 39:21.486
- CONGRATULATIONS!
- THAT'S GREAT.

39:21.527 --> 39:22.427
- "HAND IN YOUR FUCKING PAPER,"
YOU KNOW?

39:22.461 --> 39:23.631
I'M LIKE, "WELL, FUCK YOU,
YOU OLD WHORE."

39:23.662 --> 39:24.662
- YO, YO, YO.
- WHAT, WHAT?

39:24.696 --> 39:26.466
OH, SHIT.
OH, SH--WHAT'S UP?

39:26.498 --> 39:27.698
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

39:27.733 --> 39:30.943
HEY, JUSTIN. HEARD YOU'RE NOT
LIVING AT HOME ANYMORE, HUH?

39:30.969 --> 39:32.799
- THAT FUCKING DAPHNE
AND HER BIG MOUTH.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.568
- YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
- YEAH, DAPHNE.

39:34.606 --> 39:37.136
- YEAH, MAYBE IT'S
'CAUSE YOU'RE A FUCKING FAGGOT!

39:37.175 --> 39:38.575
- YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE
A FUCKING HOMO,

39:38.610 --> 39:39.510
YOU LITTLE BITCH!

39:39.545 --> 39:40.745
HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW?
- FUCKING FAGGOT!

39:40.779 --> 39:42.149
- WHAT'S UP?
- HEY, WANNA FUCKING

39:42.180 --> 39:43.820
FUCK ME IN THE ASS?
WANNA SUCK MY DICK?

39:43.849 --> 39:46.149
- JUSTIN!

39:46.184 --> 39:47.694
GET IN THE CAR.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.119
- FUCK IS THIS?

39:49.154 --> 39:50.694
- WHAT FOR?

39:50.722 --> 39:53.662
- I SAID
GET IN THE CAR.

39:56.695 --> 39:57.655
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

39:57.696 --> 40:00.766
- HOME.

40:00.799 --> 40:02.769
- JUSTIN?

40:02.801 --> 40:05.771
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

40:07.773 --> 40:12.613
WELL, IN THAT CASE, I'LL, UM,
SPEAK FOR YOUR FATHER AND ME.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.154
WE WANT YOU
TO COME HOME.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.979
IT'S WHERE YOU BELONG.

40:17.015 --> 40:20.945
AND I THINK, UH,
BRIAN WOULD AGREE.

40:20.986 --> 40:22.486
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
WHAT BRIAN--

40:22.521 --> 40:25.461
- EXCUSE ME, I WAS SPEAKING.
KINDLY LET ME FINISH.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.960
JUSTIN?

40:30.996 --> 40:34.496
- LOOK AT YOUR MOM,
JUSTIN.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.667
- YOU'RE STAYING HERE.

40:40.706 --> 40:43.776
- ONLY IF DAD SAYS HE'S SORRY,
TO BRIAN.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.539
- JUSTIN, HE IS THE ONE
WHO SHOULD BE

40:45.577 --> 40:48.047
APOLOGIZING TO YOU,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES!

40:48.079 --> 40:49.819
FOR MAKING YOU THINK
HE LOVED YOU.

40:49.848 --> 40:51.248
- HE NEVER SAID
HE LOVED ME.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.652
HE SAID IT WAS JUST A FUCK,
THAT'S ALL.

40:54.686 --> 40:56.016
BUT I'M OKAY WITH THAT
BECAUSE THAT--

40:56.054 --> 40:59.534
THAT'S ALL IT WAS,
ALL IT SHOULD BE.

41:02.127 --> 41:05.227
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW.

41:09.601 --> 41:10.841
- ONE MORE THING,
JUSTIN.

41:10.869 --> 41:11.869
- CRAIG--
- NO!

41:11.903 --> 41:13.613
NO, NO.
I'M GONNA SAY THIS.

41:13.639 --> 41:14.909
IF YOU'RE GONNA LIVE
IN THIS HOUSE,

41:14.940 --> 41:16.640
THERE'S RULES
YOU HAVE TO OBEY.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.675
YOU ARE NOT
TO GO TO GAY BARS

41:18.710 --> 41:21.650
OR TALK
ABOUT YOUR DISGUSTING LIFESTYLE.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.020
AND YOU ARE NEVER,
EVER TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

41:30.956 --> 41:34.056
- SO IN OTHER WORDS, FOR JUSTIN
TO LIVE HERE WITH YOU,

41:34.092 --> 41:37.732
HE HAS TO DENY
WHO HE IS,

41:37.763 --> 41:40.203
WHAT HE THINKS,
AND HOW HE FEELS?

41:40.231 --> 41:42.731
- NO ONE ASKED
FOR YOUR OPINION, PAL.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.138
- [sighs]

41:45.170 --> 41:48.670
WELL,
THAT'S NOT LOVE.

41:48.707 --> 41:52.037
THAT'S HATE.

41:52.077 --> 41:55.547
- GET THE FUCK
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

41:55.581 --> 41:58.521
- JUSTIN, YOU COMING?

42:02.153 --> 42:05.663
[door opens]

42:10.929 --> 42:12.059
[door closes]

42:12.097 --> 42:15.597
[cheering and applause]

42:15.634 --> 42:17.044
- * I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT

42:17.068 --> 42:20.008
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.

44:16.054 --> 44:18.464
WHAT I WAS GONNA SAY IS,

44:18.489 --> 44:22.289
IT'S NOT LYING
IF THEY MAKE YOU LIE,

44:22.327 --> 44:27.027
