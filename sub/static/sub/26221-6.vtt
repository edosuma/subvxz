<i>As a parent, you help
to pass on your best traits.</i>

00:05.941 --> 00:07.351
<i>I don't want to brag, but</i>

00:07.409 --> 00:10.144
<i>Lily's pretty, smart... Sorry, sorry...</i>

00:10.178 --> 00:12.579
<i>Smart, pretty, creative, and kind.</i>

00:12.614 --> 00:14.748
Hey ladies. Up for some tetherball?

00:14.783 --> 00:16.784
No, 'cause we're not in kindergarten.

00:16.818 --> 00:18.419
Okay, but if you change your mind,

00:18.453 --> 00:19.753
the ball's not going anywhere.

00:19.788 --> 00:21.855
It's tied to a pole.

00:21.890 --> 00:23.157
"Wanna play tetherball?"

00:23.191 --> 00:24.767
What a weirdo.

00:24.793 --> 00:26.160
Hey, I heard that.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.995
<i>Oh crap, she got my mean side.</i>

00:28.029 --> 00:30.764
All right, I gotta go key my stepmom's car.

00:30.799 --> 00:31.999
Deuces.

00:33.635 --> 00:37.504
Okay, Lily, it is not okay
to be mean to your brother like that.

00:37.539 --> 00:40.975
Mom, he was bothering us. He's so annoying.

00:41.009 --> 00:45.145
Well... Lily and her friend, Sophia,
were just really rude to Louie.

00:45.180 --> 00:47.614
Lily, I'm disappointed.
And, really, with Sophia?

00:47.649 --> 00:49.049
She seems like one of your nicer friends.

00:49.084 --> 00:50.985
She just complimented
my shirt on her way out.

00:51.019 --> 00:52.686
Yeah, did she say it like this:

00:52.721 --> 00:53.887
"Nice shirt."

00:53.922 --> 00:55.222
- Oh, I see it now.
- Yeah.

00:55.256 --> 00:56.857
- I hate myself.
- Okay listen, Lil.

00:56.891 --> 01:00.027
I'm sorry but you don't get to be mean
just 'cause someone's annoying.

01:00.061 --> 01:01.962
No friends over for a week.
You're hanging with Louie.

01:01.997 --> 01:04.465
You have to be nice, especially to family.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.133
Fine. My life sucks!

01:06.167 --> 01:08.702
Ah, it' so hard to be you.

01:08.737 --> 01:10.738
- Hey that was good co-parenting.
- That was good.

01:10.772 --> 01:13.741
Let's celebrate with these gigantic glasses
of wine I just poured us.

01:13.775 --> 01:15.509
Well then, let me put the baby down.

01:15.543 --> 01:17.177
Yeah, put the baby down.

01:17.212 --> 01:18.479
Hey, Emet, your folks are here.

01:18.513 --> 01:19.847
- Kay.
- Emet.

01:19.881 --> 01:21.548
- What?
- Come here. Now-now-now-now,

01:21.583 --> 01:22.716
- now-now-now... come here.
- What-what-what-what?

01:22.751 --> 01:24.985
- Look, look, look.
- Oh, God no.

01:25.020 --> 01:27.087
Oh, it's my annoying cousin, Leena.

01:27.122 --> 01:28.889
Everything about her makes me crazy.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.591
Yes, I know.
You hid from her at our own wedding.

01:30.625 --> 01:31.892
Okay, you know what to do. Hide.

01:31.926 --> 01:32.993
- What?
- Hide now.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.662
Hello?

01:35.697 --> 01:38.065
Emet, where are you?

01:38.099 --> 01:40.901
Oh my God, are you making
naughty in the bedroom?

01:40.935 --> 01:43.270
That would be so awkward
'cause your parents are here!

01:43.668 --> 01:45.005
Okay, we're gonna come in.

01:45.907 --> 01:47.775
Hello!

01:47.809 --> 01:50.677
<i>Yes, I'm hiding, and, yes,
I told Lily she doesn't</i>

01:50.712 --> 01:52.713
<i>get to be mean just because
someone is annoying.</i>

01:52.747 --> 01:55.082
<i>But my cousin is so annoying.</i>

01:55.116 --> 01:58.018
Emet? Don't be rude.

01:58.053 --> 01:59.686
Emet, we can see you.

01:59.721 --> 02:01.722
Hi. Oh, there's the baby.

02:01.756 --> 02:03.223
There he went. We couldn't find him.

02:03.258 --> 02:04.892
- Hi!
- Hey.

02:04.926 --> 02:06.593
- Hey, cuz.
- Hi.

02:06.628 --> 02:08.095
Get inside these.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.865
Oh, I don't... okay. Let's do it that way.

02:11.900 --> 02:14.134
<i>Aw man, my life sucks.</i>

02:19.961 --> 02:22.699
_

02:24.145 --> 02:25.979
<i>Leena's so irritating.</i>

02:26.014 --> 02:27.247
<i>Why did I have kids?</i>

02:27.282 --> 02:29.583
<i>Now I have to be a good example.</i>

02:29.617 --> 02:32.319
Anyway, so this little guy
is my latest rescue.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.889
I call him Goldblum because he's ugly
but women love him for some reason.

02:35.924 --> 02:38.792
I wish you could leave an adult woman
in a basket on a church step.

02:38.827 --> 02:41.795
Well, if your cousin Leena is
half as annoying as you talking about her

02:41.830 --> 02:43.163
all morning, then I'm with you.

02:43.198 --> 02:46.100
Yeah, Emet, your mom is forcing you
to have her over for one evening.

02:46.134 --> 02:48.302
Goldblum's mom tried to eat him.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.736
You guys don't get it, okay?

02:49.771 --> 02:52.840
I need to be a nice person,
like, Bruce Banner for Lily

02:52.874 --> 02:54.675
and Leena turns me into the Hulk.

02:54.709 --> 02:56.743
Especially with her passive
aggressive comments like,

02:56.778 --> 02:58.745
"You're really aging into your face."

02:58.780 --> 03:01.014
It's one dinner, just fake being nice.

03:01.049 --> 03:03.584
Dudes do it all the time.
It's called, "charm."

03:03.618 --> 03:06.153
Gross. Also, how do you do that?

03:06.187 --> 03:08.355
Well, you just need to follow the guy rules
for a good first date.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.356
Rule number one:

03:09.390 --> 03:10.691
Always laugh at her jokes,

03:10.725 --> 03:12.092
even if they're at your expense.

03:12.538 --> 03:13.794
Yeah, you're right.

03:13.828 --> 03:15.829
My beard does look like glued-on pubes.

03:15.864 --> 03:17.764
- That's so funny.
- Number two.

03:17.799 --> 03:19.366
If you ever space out during her stories,

03:19.400 --> 03:21.168
they only three words you need to know are,

03:21.202 --> 03:23.137
"That sounds hard."

03:23.171 --> 03:25.772
The softer you say it,
the more paying attention-y you sound.

03:25.807 --> 03:27.774
And three:
act like you care about her interests.

03:27.809 --> 03:29.710
"Oh, when you buy a pair of shoes,
they'll give

03:29.744 --> 03:31.345
"another pair to a kid
in a third world country?

03:31.379 --> 03:33.013
I'm sure they actually do that."

03:33.047 --> 03:34.948
That sounds hard. Oh, hang on...

03:34.983 --> 03:36.717
- That sounds hard.
- That sounds hard.

03:36.751 --> 03:38.318
- That sounds hard.
- That sounds so hard.

03:38.353 --> 03:40.220
You guys are all sociopaths.

03:40.255 --> 03:42.022
<i>And just for tonight, so am I.</i>

03:42.056 --> 03:45.225
<i>So I can be a kind person
and a role model for my kids.</i>

03:45.260 --> 03:47.027
Hey, Lily, do you wanna make potions?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.996
Sure, do you have one
that will make you disappear?

03:49.030 --> 03:52.045
<i>Lily and I can speak to each other
just through a look.</i>

03:52.046 --> 03:53.046
_

03:53.489 --> 03:55.066
_

03:55.330 --> 03:56.567
_

03:56.838 --> 03:58.405
Okay, Louie. Potions sound cool.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.741
Awesome. We'll need the eye of newt

04:00.775 --> 04:03.243
and the blood of a virgin dragon.

04:03.278 --> 04:06.079
Or we can just use an egg and hot sauce.

04:06.666 --> 04:08.682
<i>Ugh, Leena's here.</i>

04:08.716 --> 04:10.784
<i>Where's my calming potion?</i>

04:12.020 --> 04:13.854
Hey Em'n'Em.

04:13.888 --> 04:15.155
You're looking good.

04:15.190 --> 04:17.824
- Thank you.
- You are so skinny.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.992
Are you okay?

04:19.027 --> 04:21.261
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

04:21.296 --> 04:23.096
Your mom and I have been chopping it up.

04:23.277 --> 04:24.431
They're like girlfriends.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.867
Yeah, I talk, she talks, I talk.

04:26.901 --> 04:29.269
It's like that show, "Sex and the Town."

04:29.304 --> 04:32.105
I'm the Carrie. She's the Samantha.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.675
So I guess that would make
you the angry career woman

04:34.709 --> 04:36.243
who doesn't have time to watch the show.

04:36.422 --> 04:38.011
<i>Fake it. Fake it.</i>

04:40.448 --> 04:41.915
Come on in, come on in.

04:41.950 --> 04:43.784
It's just one night. It's just one night.

04:43.818 --> 04:45.118
I'm not gonna make it.
I'm not gonna make it.

04:45.153 --> 04:46.720
I'm gonna smash her stupid face in.

04:46.754 --> 04:49.223
Whose stupid face? Is it Auntie Leena?

04:49.257 --> 04:51.091
She's always bugged you, huh?

04:51.125 --> 04:52.359
I totally get that.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.860
- No. No. Uh-uh.
- Mm-mm.

04:53.895 --> 04:55.796
- I love Auntie Leena.
- Mm-hmm.

04:55.830 --> 04:58.432
What you just heard me saying
was something about the um...

04:58.466 --> 04:59.967
From... it's lyrics from...

05:00.001 --> 05:01.201
You don't know that Frank Sinatra song?

05:07.742 --> 05:09.876
You know, we've... we've come a long way

05:09.911 --> 05:11.245
as a culture, musically.

05:12.313 --> 05:13.591
<i>I can do this.</i>

05:13.682 --> 05:16.817
<i>I just need to get through one dinner
with Leena before she leaves town.</i>

05:16.851 --> 05:18.252
Emet, beta?

05:18.286 --> 05:20.153
I'm sorry I pressure you to cook.

05:20.188 --> 05:22.823
Because then I have to eat what you make.

05:22.857 --> 05:24.424
- Thank you for having us.
- Yeah.

05:24.459 --> 05:26.226
So, kids,

05:26.261 --> 05:29.296
this must be exciting having Mom home.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.465
She's usually at work playing video games

05:31.499 --> 05:33.100
while Grandma watches you, right?

05:33.134 --> 05:35.902
Oh, snap. She went there.

05:35.937 --> 05:37.838
Eyes down. Eat your dinner.

05:37.872 --> 05:39.806
Go to your happy place, and stay there.

05:39.841 --> 05:42.009
<i>Don't lose it. Kids are watching.</i>

05:42.043 --> 05:44.411
<i>Go to one of your guy rules. Act interested.</i>

05:44.445 --> 05:48.849
Oh Leena,
you have always had such cool jobs.

05:48.883 --> 05:53.153
I am so interested to hear what
your current endeavors are.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.488
Oh.

05:54.522 --> 05:57.157
- I'm into the healing arts now.
- Oh.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.492
Actually, that's why I'm in town,

05:58.526 --> 06:00.260
for a crystal convention.

06:00.295 --> 06:02.929
- I didn't know they had those.
- They do.

06:02.964 --> 06:04.931
Most people are very skeptical, though.

06:04.966 --> 06:06.433
Oh... Not me.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.269
Okay, I think crystals
are real and important.

06:09.304 --> 06:11.772
Oh, I wish everyone did.

06:11.806 --> 06:16.043
'Cause I invested a lot of money into this
and my rock babies are not moving.

06:16.077 --> 06:18.979
I am ass-deep in lapis lazuli and debt.

06:19.013 --> 06:21.281
Oh, beta.

06:21.316 --> 06:23.216
Oh. That sounds hard.

06:23.251 --> 06:27.220
You know, we have never
connected like this before.

06:27.255 --> 06:29.990
Mm, I wish I didn't have to leave tomorrow.

06:30.024 --> 06:31.358
- I know.
- Oh, what are you gonna do?

06:31.392 --> 06:32.893
Then don't.

06:32.927 --> 06:35.362
Emet has that big guest room and no friends.

06:35.396 --> 06:37.197
Stay longer.

06:37.231 --> 06:38.965
No.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.970
Uh... I mean, no, don't take the guest room.

06:44.005 --> 06:45.839
- Take our bedroom.
- What...

06:45.873 --> 06:50.010
Oh, my God, Emet. You are being so nice.

06:50.044 --> 06:51.131
Is that even you?

06:51.913 --> 06:54.214
Oh no, I see a little mustache.
That's you, fo' sho'.

06:54.606 --> 06:55.916
Kidding.

06:55.950 --> 06:58.151
But I will take the
guest bedroom for a week.

06:58.186 --> 07:00.320
It's gonna be fun.
Like cousin-on-cousin action.

07:01.066 --> 07:01.855
No.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.824
Do you have any, like, leafy greens?

07:03.858 --> 07:05.992
- These have no nutrition.
<i>- Are you kidding?</i>

07:06.027 --> 07:07.494
<i>I have to keep this up for a whole week?</i>

07:07.528 --> 07:09.029
<i>Kill me now.</i>

07:13.258 --> 07:14.195
<i>Hey.</i>

07:14.229 --> 07:17.198
I am not letting you
invite Leena into my house.

07:17.232 --> 07:19.166
You didn't even check with me.

07:19.201 --> 07:20.234
Well, why should I check with you?

07:20.268 --> 07:21.869
You'd just say no.

07:21.903 --> 07:23.971
You've always been horrible to that girl.

07:24.005 --> 07:26.140
Then I have to hear about it from my sister,

07:26.174 --> 07:27.808
which is horrible for me.

07:27.843 --> 07:29.543
Where are your clean sheets?

07:29.578 --> 07:31.078
Oh. These are you clean sheets.

07:31.113 --> 07:33.080
I'm horrible to her?

07:33.115 --> 07:36.217
Did you hear the way she talks
about my work, my clothes?

07:36.251 --> 07:39.754
How can you be a corporate
honcho and be so sensitive?

07:39.788 --> 07:43.157
She can stay on your couch at your condo.

07:43.191 --> 07:44.725
You're not calling the shots, lady.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.061
You're trapped. You have to play nice

07:47.095 --> 07:49.897
because you're making Lily play nice.

07:49.931 --> 07:51.599
How do you know about that?

07:51.633 --> 07:53.067
Her friend Sophia told me.

07:53.101 --> 07:55.736
I ran into her at Bloomies stealing blush.

07:55.771 --> 07:58.372
Something bad is happening
in that girl's house.

08:03.111 --> 08:06.781
You idiots. You gave me terrible advice.

08:06.815 --> 08:07.915
What? No way.

08:07.949 --> 08:10.584
Our advice for faking nice
always gets us at least a second date.

08:10.619 --> 08:12.086
I didn't want a second date,

08:12.120 --> 08:14.088
and now Leena's staying
with me for a whole week.

08:14.122 --> 08:16.123
Now I have to figure out a way
to secretly get rid of her,

08:16.158 --> 08:17.958
without Lily finding out.

08:17.993 --> 08:20.928
Ah, well, that calls
for a whole other set of rules.

08:20.962 --> 08:23.764
AKA: "Find your knickers,
love, it's time to go."

08:23.799 --> 08:25.766
Yeah, you gotta make it impossible
for her to stick around.

08:25.801 --> 08:27.968
I dated this chick once
who had a shellfish allergy

08:28.003 --> 08:29.223
and she mentioned marriage.

08:29.237 --> 08:32.273
So I just rubbed shrimp
all over myself every time we boned.

08:32.307 --> 08:34.308
Long story short, she gone.

08:35.602 --> 08:36.710
Griff, you're brilliant.

08:36.745 --> 08:38.078
Leena's allergic to dogs.

08:39.981 --> 08:42.650
Norman, I'm gonna give
Goldblum a loving home.

08:42.683 --> 08:44.284
- Mine.
- Great.

08:44.319 --> 08:46.720
You're gonna need to take
regular fecal samples.

08:46.755 --> 08:48.422
He's got a parasite.

08:48.456 --> 08:50.256
You and me both, Goldblum.

08:50.258 --> 08:52.226
You and me both.

08:53.829 --> 08:55.963
<i>Here we go. I walk in with this mangy dog.</i>

08:55.997 --> 08:57.932
<i>My cousin chokes on her tongue, goes home,</i>

08:57.966 --> 08:59.400
<i>and no one knows I'm a bad person.</i>

08:59.434 --> 09:00.935
Oh, Mommy's home. Hi, Mommy.

09:00.969 --> 09:01.936
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:01.970 --> 09:03.270
What the hell is that?

09:03.305 --> 09:05.105
Oh, I bought some crystal-infused water

09:05.140 --> 09:07.341
from Leena to be kind and try
to set a good example for Lily.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.909
It's disgusting.

09:09.335 --> 09:10.744
What the hell is that?

09:10.779 --> 09:12.179
- Uh, okay, it's a dog.
- What?

09:12.214 --> 09:13.981
No, no, no. We told the kids no dog.

09:14.015 --> 09:15.316
Oh. No, no, no. It's not staying.

09:15.350 --> 09:16.350
I don't even want the kids to see it.

09:16.384 --> 09:18.752
Okay look, its face is cute,
but its ass has worms.

09:18.787 --> 09:20.154
Emet, what is going on here?

09:20.188 --> 09:21.422
- Don't worry about it just...
- Ah-choo!

09:21.456 --> 09:23.324
Um, is there a dog in the house?

09:23.358 --> 09:25.326
Oh, I think I see what's going on here.

09:26.862 --> 09:28.429
Oh, I hate to tell you this, Em,

09:28.463 --> 09:30.831
but I am deeply allergic to dogs, remember?

09:30.866 --> 09:34.001
Which is ironic because
I was a dog in a previous life.

09:34.035 --> 09:35.836
Gosh, I am so sorry.

09:35.871 --> 09:40.174
I just promised a co-worker that I would
foster this poor, abandoned little guy.

09:40.208 --> 09:41.809
But you know what?

09:41.843 --> 09:43.978
Back to the kill shelter
for you, Tiger, kay?

09:44.012 --> 09:45.212
Or, you know what?

09:45.247 --> 09:46.480
David could take you to a hotel...

09:46.514 --> 09:48.148
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

09:48.183 --> 09:50.017
If I can handle all the dust in this house,

09:50.051 --> 09:51.352
I can handle the dander.

09:51.599 --> 09:53.287
Just keep that guy locked away

09:53.321 --> 09:55.189
and I'll power through this or die trying.

09:56.855 --> 09:57.791
Oof.

09:57.826 --> 10:00.194
<i>God, I really hope she dies trying.</i>

10:05.233 --> 10:07.868
Okay, this plan is so immature.

10:07.903 --> 10:09.370
Oh, okay, okay, I know, but in my defense,

10:09.404 --> 10:10.404
I thought it would work.

10:10.438 --> 10:12.139
It's okay, I called Norman.

10:12.173 --> 10:13.307
He's gonna come get Goldblum

10:13.341 --> 10:14.975
before the kids wake up, okay?

10:15.010 --> 10:17.745
Oh, my God, Goldblum,
go to sleep, you horny Muppet.

10:17.779 --> 10:18.846
You know...
you know what's gonna happen, right?

10:18.880 --> 10:20.180
Leena's allergic to the dog.

10:20.215 --> 10:21.715
Her throat's gonna close up.
She's gonna die,

10:21.750 --> 10:22.716
And who's gonna take care of the body?

10:22.751 --> 10:24.351
You? No. Me.

10:24.386 --> 10:25.886
'Cause it's a man's job.

10:25.921 --> 10:27.021
Please. Come on. Stop, stop, stop, stop.

10:29.057 --> 10:30.724
And we have our fecal sample.

10:30.759 --> 10:31.926
- Okay. Okay.
- That's on you.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.727
- You take care of that.
- No...

10:33.762 --> 10:35.062
<i>That's how you make a friendship bracelet.</i>

10:35.096 --> 10:36.764
Now go make a friend.

10:36.798 --> 10:39.066
I haven't practiced dance
all week because of you.

10:39.100 --> 10:41.101
Hey, you know what?
I can help you practice dance.

10:41.136 --> 10:43.237
I need some help shaking
my badonkadonk though.

10:43.271 --> 10:46.106
That's not my job. Go watch a Ciara video.

10:46.141 --> 10:49.076
Lil, just help your brother
shake his badonkadonk.

10:49.110 --> 10:51.412
Your dad and I had the worst night ever.

10:51.446 --> 10:55.410
Mmm, best sleep ever.

10:55.450 --> 10:57.885
I slept so hard I forgot I was woke.

10:57.919 --> 11:01.388
Anyway, I had the craziest dream last night.

11:01.423 --> 11:02.957
Oh, you know what? I have to go to work.

11:02.991 --> 11:04.425
- Otherwise I'd hear it.
- Oh.

11:04.459 --> 11:06.427
Fancy office girl.

11:06.461 --> 11:09.229
You know,
I always thought your job was so cool.

11:09.264 --> 11:10.898
I wonder if I'd be good at it.

11:10.932 --> 11:13.200
Of course, you'd be good at it, beta.

11:13.234 --> 11:15.102
It's just doodling cartoons.

11:15.136 --> 11:18.472
Ping-pong, Pokémon,
Donkey Schlong, whatever.

11:18.506 --> 11:21.308
Emet, you should take her to GameSlap today

11:21.343 --> 11:23.444
and help her with her career goals.

11:23.478 --> 11:25.980
Oh, yeah, you know what? I would love to.

11:26.014 --> 11:28.816
I just, uh, can't be bringing
people to work willy-nilly.

11:30.251 --> 11:32.820
<i>Oh no, I think Lily's onto me.</i>

11:32.854 --> 11:34.388
Uh, yes, fine, fine.

11:34.422 --> 11:36.924
Leena, you can come with me for a few hours.

11:36.958 --> 11:38.258
Ah, great!

11:38.293 --> 11:39.960
I'll make a playlist for the ride.

11:39.995 --> 11:42.963
My drum circle just came out with an EP.

11:47.335 --> 11:48.836
Okay. Hey guys, listen.

11:48.870 --> 11:51.238
Oh, well if it isn't the doggie un-adopter.

11:51.272 --> 11:53.007
Luckily, I found him a new home.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.309
But now there's a Goldblum-shaped
hole in my heart

11:55.343 --> 11:58.245
that I will never... Hey, what's up?

11:58.279 --> 12:00.981
Norman, humanitarian and
Aquarius if you're into that.

12:01.016 --> 12:03.150
Hey Norman. Leo.

12:03.184 --> 12:05.119
And in case you were wondering,

12:05.153 --> 12:07.454
- I'm not afraid of the dark.
- Oh, my God.

12:07.489 --> 12:09.323
That means I'm into black guys.

12:09.357 --> 12:12.493
Uh, guys, this is my cousin, Leena.

12:12.527 --> 12:14.928
Don't mind me,
just gonna be a fly on the wall.

12:14.963 --> 12:17.297
Great. Okay so, Chewey,

12:17.332 --> 12:19.333
did you do the background
for the downloadable content?

12:19.367 --> 12:22.202
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Question from the wall.

12:22.237 --> 12:23.971
How much money do you make, Emet?

12:24.647 --> 12:26.206
Leena, that's personal.

12:26.241 --> 12:28.842
What? I've never understood
why money is so personal.

12:28.877 --> 12:32.179
To me, personal is more like
embarrassing stuff you wouldn't tell anyone.

12:32.213 --> 12:34.448
You know, like that one time
you made out with our cousin

12:34.482 --> 12:36.316
because you thought he
looked like Michael Jackson.

12:37.091 --> 12:39.019
- What?
- Do you remember that?

12:39.054 --> 12:40.454
Okay, great. Let's get back to work.

12:40.488 --> 12:42.356
Quick question though:
Was the song playing when

12:42.390 --> 12:44.158
you were making out, was it,
"Billy Jean Is Not My Cousin?"

12:44.192 --> 12:45.959
Or was it, "Annie Are You Okay...

12:45.994 --> 12:48.328
With Me Making Out With My Cousin?"

12:48.363 --> 12:50.164
"It Doesn't Matter If
You're Black Or My Cousin."

12:50.642 --> 12:51.965
Hee-hee, a-hee!

12:52.000 --> 12:53.534
Listen, hey, Leena, let's...

12:53.568 --> 12:55.469
let's get you a cab out of here.

12:55.503 --> 12:57.404
Oh. But I'm having so much fun.

12:57.439 --> 12:59.006
- Boo.
- She just got here.

12:59.040 --> 13:01.175
All right. Well, add me on the 'Gram.

13:01.209 --> 13:02.309
Bye.

13:02.343 --> 13:03.577
Kay, move faster.

13:03.611 --> 13:05.579
<i>Before you make Hulk smash.</i>

13:05.613 --> 13:10.017
The heat will draw out impurities
and other crap from your ear.

13:10.051 --> 13:13.053
Thank you for allowing me
to be part of your wellness journey.

13:13.088 --> 13:15.189
I mean, not like
you would take no for an answer...

13:15.223 --> 13:17.991
Well a no is just a yes waiting to be born.

13:18.026 --> 13:20.561
I learned that when I sold
subprime mortgages.

13:20.595 --> 13:22.496
- Namaste.
- Namaste, okay.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.231
Oh. There is a little
bit of blood coming out.

13:24.265 --> 13:25.599
- What?
- I'll get alcohol swabs.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.401
I think I'm light-headed. Is that normal...

13:28.001 --> 13:31.004
- What?
- Work is awful. Home is awful.

13:31.039 --> 13:33.040
Please tell me that you saved
the pills the doctor gave you

13:33.074 --> 13:34.575
when your back went out,
because I would like to

13:34.609 --> 13:36.243
sleep until she is gone.

13:36.277 --> 13:37.344
- Emet.
- Oh, God!

13:37.378 --> 13:39.446
- Yay!
- There she is.

13:39.481 --> 13:40.681
You're home.

13:40.715 --> 13:42.449
I have been waiting to tell you,

13:42.484 --> 13:45.052
there was an open admin assistant position

13:45.086 --> 13:48.255
at GamePunch, and guess who applied?

13:48.289 --> 13:50.023
- No.
- Me!

13:50.058 --> 13:51.525
We're gonna be work cousins.

13:51.559 --> 13:53.427
We're gonna have breakfast
together, and then

13:53.461 --> 13:56.430
we're gonna have, like,
girls' night happy hour after work...

13:56.464 --> 13:58.632
<i>No, no, no, no, no. That's it.</i>

13:58.666 --> 14:01.935
<i>I have tried to be nice to
set an example for my kids,</i>

14:01.970 --> 14:03.637
<i>but this is too far.</i>

14:03.951 --> 14:05.205
<i>I'm done.</i>

14:05.240 --> 14:06.974
Can you handle it?

14:07.008 --> 14:08.075
- I'm gonna frickin' get her...
- Hey...

14:10.445 --> 14:12.370
First she invades my home,
then she invades the place

14:12.445 --> 14:13.771
that I go to to get away from home.

14:13.780 --> 14:15.881
And don't tell me to be nice.
I am ending it.

14:15.915 --> 14:17.482
- Do it.
- Really?

14:17.516 --> 14:18.984
- End it.
- Really?

14:19.018 --> 14:20.986
Yes. That woman is insane.

14:21.020 --> 14:22.387
I mean, look what she did to my ear.

14:22.421 --> 14:24.055
And that's the hole I'm
least concerned about.

14:24.090 --> 14:25.490
You know, I swallowed
one of those water crystals?

14:25.524 --> 14:26.658
Now I have to wait for it to pass.

14:26.692 --> 14:28.126
What are we gonna do?

14:28.160 --> 14:29.561
- I'm gonna go nuclear.
- Okay.

14:29.595 --> 14:32.063
- My mother likes Leena, right?
- Mm-hmm.

14:32.098 --> 14:34.065
- What if she didn't?
- I'm listening.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.634
I mean, it sounds like I'm underwater,
but I'm listening.

14:35.668 --> 14:38.203
I'm gonna bring up the family scandal,

14:38.237 --> 14:39.704
of which we never speak.

14:42.519 --> 14:44.576
Oh, I thought the crystal
was crowning, but no, it's not.

14:44.610 --> 14:46.344
But also... Do you mean...

14:46.379 --> 14:48.313
Yes, the diamond earrings.

14:48.347 --> 14:50.081
- It's perfect.
- Oh, my God.

14:50.116 --> 14:53.090
It'll just seem like my mom and Leena
had a fight and our hands will be clean.

14:53.119 --> 14:55.587
And Lily and Louis will still
think that we are good people.

14:55.621 --> 14:57.422
Oh, and your mom will freak out.

14:57.456 --> 14:59.691
Do it, burn this family to the ground.

15:00.557 --> 15:01.359
We've had a good run.

15:01.394 --> 15:03.028
Yes, we have.

15:06.132 --> 15:07.332
- Kids are watching a movie?
- Yes.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.400
- The baby's asleep?
- Yes.

15:08.434 --> 15:09.701
- Here we go.
- Hi.

15:09.735 --> 15:11.603
Hi.

15:11.637 --> 15:15.607
So, would it be weird if I put a tip jar
on my desk at GamePunch?

15:15.641 --> 15:16.675
I mean, if I get the job.

15:16.709 --> 15:18.410
Oh, you're gonna get it.

15:18.444 --> 15:20.111
And then we're gonna celebrate, huh?

15:20.146 --> 15:22.113
- Mm-hmm.
- Yes, party!

15:22.148 --> 15:25.550
Speaking of celebrations, hey, your parents'

15:25.584 --> 15:27.719
anniversary party is gonna be
happening soon, right?

15:27.753 --> 15:29.387
- That's exciting.
- Mm-hmm.

15:29.422 --> 15:32.390
It is. I mean, it is a lot of work.

15:32.425 --> 15:34.759
You've never given your
parents an anniversary party,

15:34.794 --> 15:36.695
- so you wouldn't know.
- Mm-hmm.

15:38.397 --> 15:40.532
Yes, that sounds amazing.

15:40.566 --> 15:42.968
Hey, your mom is such a fashionista.

15:43.002 --> 15:44.636
What is she wearing?

15:44.670 --> 15:47.739
Oh, a gorgeous black dress
just dripping in sequins.

15:47.773 --> 15:50.608
More sequins than Michael Jackson,
you should like that.

15:52.153 --> 15:55.046
- No.
- That sounds so pretty.

15:55.081 --> 15:57.215
What is the rest of her ensemble, though?

15:57.249 --> 15:59.050
Uh, some fancy black flats.

15:59.085 --> 16:01.386
She can't do heels anymore. Diabetes feet.

16:01.420 --> 16:03.154
Oh, so sad. Accessories?

16:03.189 --> 16:05.724
Oh, the diamond earrings
Grandma left to her, of course.

16:05.758 --> 16:07.759
Left to her?

16:07.793 --> 16:09.561
It's happening. It's happening.

16:09.595 --> 16:11.429
You mean the diamond
earrings she stole from me.

16:11.464 --> 16:14.265
No, Mom got those earrings fair and square.

16:14.300 --> 16:16.768
Everyone knows she took
care of Grandma at the end.

16:16.802 --> 16:18.737
What bull[bleep].

16:18.771 --> 16:20.605
I hope someone left someone a set of plates.

16:20.639 --> 16:22.307
If by "took care of her" you mean

16:22.341 --> 16:24.409
hovered over her like a vulture,

16:24.443 --> 16:26.277
waiting for her to take her last breath

16:26.312 --> 16:28.413
so she could steal the
diamond earrings that were

16:28.447 --> 16:31.349
promised to my lobes... then, yes!

16:31.384 --> 16:34.119
Leena, how could you?

16:40.826 --> 16:42.460
Do I need to say it in English?

16:42.495 --> 16:44.229
No, no, no. I'll go.

16:45.578 --> 16:47.799
Okay, that's wasteful.

16:49.535 --> 16:51.136
Come.

16:54.073 --> 16:55.640
- Oh.
- What?

16:55.674 --> 16:57.375
- Boom-chicka, boom-chicka.
- That way. This way.

16:59.245 --> 17:02.547
I am so angry my mouth tastes like metal.

17:02.581 --> 17:06.117
Why would that silly girl bring
up the family death earrings?

17:06.152 --> 17:09.186
Why? My darling, can you be so blind?

17:09.221 --> 17:10.521
You've been played.

17:10.556 --> 17:12.824
What... what are you saying, Googaloo?

17:12.858 --> 17:14.492
"What's your mom wearing to the party?

17:14.527 --> 17:16.795
"No, no, no, not the dress. Talk some more.

17:16.829 --> 17:19.464
"No, no, no,
not the shoes on the diabetic feet.

17:19.498 --> 17:23.867
Keep talking until you
bring up the earrings."

17:23.903 --> 17:25.670
- Oh.
- Wake up, lady.

17:25.704 --> 17:27.806
Emet used you to get rid of Leena.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.808
Clever girl.

17:30.190 --> 17:32.510
She has my best qualities.

17:34.613 --> 17:37.449
Now I end her.

17:39.070 --> 17:41.783
Bye, candles. Bye, crystals.

17:41.818 --> 17:43.752
- Bye...
- You can stop packing.

17:43.786 --> 17:45.626
I think Leena should stay.

17:45.661 --> 17:47.089
Damn it, you're onto me already?

17:47.123 --> 17:50.092
Your whole life you've been
a little bitch to that girl.

17:50.126 --> 17:52.094
- What's wrong with you, man?
- I don't know.

17:52.128 --> 17:55.263
You're the one who broke my
Nate Berkus for Target plates.

17:55.298 --> 17:56.798
She just... she drives me crazy.

17:56.833 --> 18:01.103
Why? You manage to be nice to
all those losers that you work with.

18:01.137 --> 18:05.107
What is it about poor Leena?
Why can't you be nice to her?

18:05.141 --> 18:06.408
I don't know,
maybe it's 'cause you're always

18:06.442 --> 18:08.804
nicer to her than you are to me.

18:09.078 --> 18:10.112
<i>Breakthrough.</i>

18:10.146 --> 18:12.814
<i>I'm calling my shrink right after this.</i>

18:12.849 --> 18:16.651
You have always been
kinder and more forgiving

18:16.686 --> 18:18.920
and more encouraging to Leena than to me.

18:18.955 --> 18:20.288
You support her career goals.

18:20.323 --> 18:22.090
You praise her for everything she does.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.745
You chop it up like you're girlfriends.

18:24.780 --> 18:26.962
What do you love so much
about that whack job?

18:29.198 --> 18:31.299
I knew this day would come.

18:31.334 --> 18:35.103
- Many years ago, I took a lover.
- What's that, now?

18:35.138 --> 18:37.939
I became heavy with his child.

18:37.974 --> 18:39.808
I knew I had to hide my secret.

18:39.842 --> 18:43.145
Your aunt agreed to take the baby.

18:43.179 --> 18:48.283
And that baby was my sweet Leena.

18:48.317 --> 18:50.819
She's my daughter.

18:50.853 --> 18:52.053
Mom, you're a jerk.

18:52.088 --> 18:55.157
She's selling rocks for goodness sake.

18:55.191 --> 18:57.025
I'm nice to her because she needs it.

18:57.059 --> 18:59.895
She has none of your talent or success.

18:59.929 --> 19:01.296
You think I'm talented and successful?

19:01.330 --> 19:03.064
Why don't you ever say that?

19:03.099 --> 19:04.800
Why don't you ever tell me that

19:04.834 --> 19:08.203
I'm a good mom and grandma and I work hard

19:08.237 --> 19:10.205
and I look great for my age?

19:10.239 --> 19:13.175
Well, you do. And I don't know.

19:13.209 --> 19:15.844
That's why I tried to hide
my hypocrisy from Lily.

19:15.878 --> 19:18.313
Okay? I want her to be nice to Louie.

19:19.226 --> 19:20.982
I want them to be better people than we are.

19:21.017 --> 19:22.851
Um, I'm pretty sure we already are.

19:22.885 --> 19:24.219
Oh, no.

19:24.253 --> 19:26.630
All I did was normal big-sister stuff.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.491
You plotted against your cousin
and screamed at your mom.

19:29.525 --> 19:31.092
- That's fair.
- Wait a minute.

19:31.127 --> 19:34.362
Is "Smash Her Stupid Face In"
even a real song?

19:34.397 --> 19:35.730
No.

19:35.765 --> 19:37.499
Unbelievable.

19:39.068 --> 19:42.337
Okay, if those two little buttheads
try to milk this for iPads,

19:42.371 --> 19:44.039
you're going halfsies with me.

19:44.073 --> 19:45.907
<i>All right, I can be a hypocrite.</i>

19:45.942 --> 19:47.876
<i>But if I want my daughter
to be a better person,</i>

19:47.910 --> 19:50.045
<i>that means I have to be a better person too.</i>

19:50.079 --> 19:51.379
<i>Which is such a pain in the ass.</i>

19:51.414 --> 19:52.881
<i>But here it goes.</i>

19:52.915 --> 19:55.016
Leena, I have to be honest.

19:55.051 --> 19:57.018
I tried to sabotage you with my mom

19:57.053 --> 19:58.787
to drive you out of my house.

19:58.821 --> 20:00.222
And I'm sorry.

20:00.789 --> 20:02.390
What is wrong with you?

20:02.425 --> 20:06.228
I'm kidding, I totally understand
why you had to get me out.

20:08.998 --> 20:10.465
It's pretty clear
your husband's into me.

20:11.299 --> 20:12.400
Oh, I don't think David's...

20:12.435 --> 20:14.536
And that's why I probably
shouldn't come around anymore.

20:14.570 --> 20:16.471
<i>Hello, honesty? Hold please.</i>

20:16.506 --> 20:19.140
Yes. Yeah, I think that's very wise.

20:19.175 --> 20:20.942
This must be so hard for you, knowing

20:20.977 --> 20:22.978
your husband really wants me,
but is stuck with you.

20:23.012 --> 20:25.413
But while we're being honest,
I wanted to let you know

20:25.448 --> 20:27.115
I kissed Jagdish, too.

20:27.149 --> 20:28.550
- At his wedding.
- Oh.

20:28.584 --> 20:30.252
I'm bad. I know. In front of his wife.

20:31.587 --> 20:33.455
Okay.

20:33.489 --> 20:35.056
Guess this is good-bye.

20:35.091 --> 20:37.259
Oh, bye forever. Okay.

20:37.293 --> 20:39.060
The airport, m'lady?

20:39.095 --> 20:41.496
Oh. Thank you.

20:42.007 --> 20:44.432
Also, I'm gonna need a large Gatorade,
a cheeseburger,

20:44.467 --> 20:46.134
and just some straight-up cash.

20:46.168 --> 20:48.470
Well, I have water
and treats for you in the car.

20:48.504 --> 20:50.272
Mmm.

20:50.306 --> 20:52.107
One man's mess is another man's rescue.

20:52.141 --> 20:53.475
Let's go with that.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.279
- Come on!
- Yeah, bye. Oh, okay, I see that heart.

20:57.313 --> 20:59.114
Okay, gosh... Oh, broke the heart.

21:00.008 --> 21:03.184
Leave, you. Skedaddle.

21:03.219 --> 21:04.586
All right, how'd that go?

21:05.363 --> 21:06.549
She gone.

21:07.023 --> 21:09.791
Oh, and she thinks
that you're in love with her.

21:09.825 --> 21:11.092
All I heard was, "she gone."

21:13.029 --> 21:14.829
- Oh.
- What?

21:14.864 --> 21:16.965
- Oh, no, oh, it's happening
- Yeah, it's the crystal.

21:16.999 --> 21:18.366
Okay go in there and, uh,

21:18.401 --> 21:19.834
- focus on the exhale!
- Okay.
