WEBVTT

00:28.310 --> 00:29.641
Poorguy.

01:01.930 --> 01:05.809
So I guess you know what this is,

01:05.940 --> 01:07.760
Comandante Verdn.

01:09.900 --> 01:12.778
We are going to ask you some questions.

01:13.530 --> 01:15.066
Answer them,

01:15.650 --> 01:18.027
and when you get to the States,

01:18.620 --> 01:21.236
you get the full deal.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.536
Immunity.

01:23.830 --> 01:25.957
Witness protection.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.740
Money.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.701
It's the best and only deal
you're going to get.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.331
And better than you deserve.

07:19.020 --> 07:20.055
Hey.

07:21.600 --> 07:23.227
I'm looking for Don Juan.

07:23.440 --> 07:25.260
Uncle Juan's inside, sir.

07:43.040 --> 07:45.167
I'm looking for Don Juan. Is he here?

07:45.250 --> 07:46.330
Go ahead.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.185
Wait here.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.655
Good morning.

08:28.710 --> 08:29.745
Try it.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.961
Masita tamaulipeca.

08:34.550 --> 08:35.460
Let's see...

08:38.550 --> 08:41.633
-It's very good.
-You're being kind. It needs more salt.

08:41.720 --> 08:42.846
Try now.

08:50.610 --> 08:51.929
Better?

08:52.190 --> 08:53.817
Hand me a napkin, please.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.066
Pleasure to meet you, Don Juan.

08:58.740 --> 09:00.537
I'm glad we can take this opportunity to--

09:00.620 --> 09:02.997
To talk business?

09:03.330 --> 09:04.991
And we will.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.997
But first, we must talk life.

09:08.540 --> 09:09.700
scar!

09:10.090 --> 09:12.581
-Yes, Don Juan?
-See that this gets to the party.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.751
Don't be eating any of it,

09:14.840 --> 09:17.718
'cause I want to see you stuffing
your face tonight.

09:20.930 --> 09:22.056
All right.

09:23.520 --> 09:26.057
Let's take a ride.
I have something to show you.

09:26.890 --> 09:27.891
Let's go.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.448
Any money for us, Uncle Juan?

09:38.570 --> 09:42.279
Not today, kids. Don't have any on me.

09:43.410 --> 09:44.536
Got any coins?

09:44.620 --> 09:46.076
I don't have any money.

09:46.410 --> 09:47.616
I owe you, kids.

09:48.960 --> 09:50.621
If the
sear
will tell us
your destination,

09:50.710 --> 09:52.450
-we can send men in advance.
-GIve me a break.

09:52.840 --> 09:56.162
It'll be a cold day in hell when I fear
for my life in my own hometown. Let's go.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.427
-Are you getting in or not?
-Stay here.

09:59.510 --> 10:00.670
Yes, sir.

10:39.130 --> 10:42.008
This guy's ex-DFS, trained by the CIA.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.881
How to interrogate
and how to resist it, man.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.477
So you don't think he will crack?

10:49.730 --> 10:51.049
Not betting on it.

10:51.850 --> 10:54.227
The gringos don't have what it takes.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.060
Well...

10:58.030 --> 11:00.021
I hope he does.

11:02.660 --> 11:03.729
Fuckit

11:04.580 --> 11:05.865
It's a paycheck.

11:06.410 --> 11:08.742
Walt bails, I'll find another one.

11:11.330 --> 11:12.957
Still got your badge?

11:14.250 --> 11:15.831
Jalisco State Police, right?

11:16.750 --> 11:18.377
Always pays well to carry a badge.

11:19.050 --> 11:23.464
They give up... and go home,
this thing ends.

11:24.930 --> 11:26.591
Pretty soon,
people start asking questions.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.966
Who helped them? Who worked with them?

11:29.980 --> 11:31.629
That guy in there's seen your face.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.896
So either he talks...

11:34.770 --> 11:37.227
or you and everyone you care about dies.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.316
You got into this for a paycheck?

11:41.900 --> 11:43.856
Man, don't be fucking stupid.

11:44.780 --> 11:46.691
We're all in this with our lives.

12:26.280 --> 12:29.693
It's called the Gateway
International Bridge.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.492
I was 11 years old when they finished it.

12:32.790 --> 12:34.781
1926.

12:36.250 --> 12:39.913
Five years later,
I was going back and forth,

12:40.000 --> 12:42.753
moving alcohol across it.
That's how I started.

12:45.680 --> 12:48.797
When the Americans stopped needing booze,

12:49.350 --> 12:53.514
we moved on to smuggling other things:
people, coffee...

12:57.230 --> 12:58.185
opium.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.987
An endless appetite.

13:04.490 --> 13:06.651
The gringos always need something.

13:10.330 --> 13:12.366
Who could blame us for giving it to them?

13:20.750 --> 13:22.752
It pays to have friends.

13:26.340 --> 13:28.046
It pays well, Miguel ngel.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.669
Yeah.

13:33.930 --> 13:35.841
You've done amazing things here, Don Juan.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.726
Which is why I've come.

13:40.110 --> 13:41.759
The game has changed.

13:42.610 --> 13:44.987
I believe that it's time
to rethink our relationship.

13:45.110 --> 13:47.487
A union between our two organizations
would make--

13:47.570 --> 13:49.231
Do you know anything about Rome?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.479
-Excuse me?
-Rome.

13:52.330 --> 13:54.867
Rome? Yes, of course.

13:54.950 --> 13:58.204
They presided over the largest empire
the world had ever known.

13:58.790 --> 14:00.280
A beacon in the world.

14:01.380 --> 14:07.125
They conquered barbarians from what is now
Germany, France, England.

14:07.340 --> 14:11.219
Rome bested these savages,
brought them under their own flag.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.216
Gave them an identity.

14:14.600 --> 14:16.841
Just like you did

14:17.270 --> 14:20.854
when you turned a disorganized rabble
of Sinaloan dealers into your own empire.

14:21.440 --> 14:25.604
It served all of us to band together.

14:25.940 --> 14:27.430
As a union.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.771
I'm sure I wasn't the first
to think of it.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.656
But the first to do it.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.901
And that is a huge feat.

14:37.160 --> 14:42.496
Look, Miguel ngel,
the little I do know about you...

14:43.590 --> 14:45.490
doesn't tell me very much.

14:47.210 --> 14:50.794
When you want something, you take it.

14:51.470 --> 14:55.133
Nothing comes between you
and what you want.

14:55.850 --> 14:58.808
But what a man wants tells us nothing.

14:59.180 --> 15:01.182
What a man needs...

15:03.020 --> 15:04.681
tells us everything.

15:06.980 --> 15:09.028
I know that you want to talk business,
and we will.

15:09.110 --> 15:11.772
If there is a deal to be made,
we will make it.

15:12.320 --> 15:17.405
But first, I want you to know who I am,
what defines me.

15:18.660 --> 15:19.900
What I need.

15:21.960 --> 15:25.282
Hopefully, I will learn the same
about you.

15:57.080 --> 15:58.115
Where's your boss?

16:02.000 --> 16:03.319
He hasn ’1' come back.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.706
And not a fucking thing is happening
since he's been gone.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.161
Even on the runways that are working.

16:08.630 --> 16:13.465
One of Matta's planes tried to land
at Samalayuca,

16:14.130 --> 16:16.849
but there was nobody there to unload it.

16:16.930 --> 16:18.215
So they flew away.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.301
Couldn't some of your guys
have unloaded it?

16:21.430 --> 16:23.432
We're cops, man.

16:23.690 --> 16:26.181
We don't handle that shit.

16:26.480 --> 16:28.721
The one responsible for this mess...

16:29.190 --> 16:30.680
is Acosta.

16:32.190 --> 16:33.441
He's the boss.

16:33.530 --> 16:34.815
He splits...

16:36.120 --> 16:37.690
everyone splits.

16:38.030 --> 16:40.828
That's how shit works in Jurez.

16:40.910 --> 16:43.652
Yeah, I get it, but do you understand,

16:43.750 --> 16:48.164
if we don't get this dump up and running,
there won't be any more shit?

16:48.250 --> 16:49.410
You don't say?

16:50.380 --> 16:53.759
We have to go out there, to Ojinaga,
and bring him back here.

16:53.970 --> 16:55.835
-Got it?
-We?

16:56.010 --> 16:57.216
Yes, we.

16:59.470 --> 17:00.960
Not we. You.

17:01.600 --> 17:05.058
I have important federal business
back in the city.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.300
What kind of business?

17:06.400 --> 17:08.550
The fuck is it to you?

17:08.770 --> 17:10.647
Call me when you find Acosta.

17:12.780 --> 17:13.815
Let's get out of here!

17:33.670 --> 17:36.002
Benjamn, these gentlemen came
all the way from Los Angeles

17:36.090 --> 17:38.467
to show us something marvelous.
You're going to love it.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.462
-Have you lost your mind, Enedina?
-Excuse me?

19:00.130 --> 19:01.757
Who do you want to kill us first?

19:02.220 --> 19:03.881
The Colombians or Flix?

19:04.850 --> 19:07.887
We don't deal directly with dealers
in the States. You know that.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.345
And still you do it, Enedina?

19:09.430 --> 19:12.092
For God's sake,
I was exploring the future.

19:12.270 --> 19:14.261
Our deal with the Colombians
is Flix's deal,

19:14.360 --> 19:15.896
and Flix won't hold on forever.

19:15.980 --> 19:19.063
-It's smart business.
-It's not smart.

19:19.740 --> 19:22.698
And it's not your fucking place.
Stick to your business.

19:22.780 --> 19:24.020
-My business?
-Yeah.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.985
-My business is this family.
-That's right, the family.

19:26.080 --> 19:28.537
What the fuck are they doing here?
This is my home.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.490
Francisco is getting out of jail today.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.992
You should be planning his party,
not doing this shit, Enedina.

19:34.080 --> 19:36.958
You're doing such a great job, Benjamn.
Look around.

19:37.050 --> 19:38.165
Bravo!

19:45.970 --> 19:47.210
He wants to try first.

19:53.650 --> 19:54.935
Come close.

20:04.410 --> 20:05.809
Ramn, how is it?

20:26.390 --> 20:28.210
Where the fuck is Acosta?

20:35.100 --> 20:39.605
You telling me that none of you
motherfuckers know where your boss is?

20:40.780 --> 20:41.815
I know.

20:42.610 --> 20:43.986
Yeah? Well, where is he?

20:45.660 --> 20:46.900
He's at Mimi's.

20:47.370 --> 20:49.656
Where can I find this Mimi?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.650
She's in Texas.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.090
Ernesto Fonseca.

21:52.810 --> 21:54.095
Caro Quintero.

22:43.770 --> 22:45.431
There's his fucking truck.

22:45.530 --> 22:46.770
Yeah, he's here.

22:47.110 --> 22:48.145
Acosta !

22:55.330 --> 22:56.490
Acosta !

23:00.330 --> 23:02.787
Go around back.

23:03.290 --> 23:04.370
But be careful.

23:04.460 --> 23:05.836
We're in the States now.

23:29.190 --> 23:30.100
Motherfucker!

23:32.990 --> 23:35.572
Hey. Don't shoot.

23:36.410 --> 23:38.196
-So what do we fucking do, boss?
-Nothing, dipshit.

23:38.290 --> 23:41.202
We're not going to shoot a gringa
in the States. Don't do anything.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.280
Hey, Amado.

24:25.630 --> 24:28.337
Are you fucking kidding me?
Were you up there the whole time, asshole?

24:28.710 --> 24:30.951
Yeah. I'm just doing some roofing up here.

24:31.050 --> 24:32.119
Rooﬁng?

24:32.470 --> 24:34.006
Why didn't you fucking answer me?

24:34.430 --> 24:35.636
I wanted to see what happened.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.751
I could have shot her!

24:38.140 --> 24:39.380
I don't think so.

24:40.390 --> 24:42.267
Amado, this is Mimi.

24:42.520 --> 24:44.932
Mimi, this is Amado.

24:45.310 --> 24:47.517
He is always dressed like this.
Like a crow.

24:50.400 --> 24:51.480
Stay here.

24:52.190 --> 24:53.441
What the fuck?

24:53.780 --> 24:55.236
There's been a delay.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.368
I told you yesterday to move this shit.

24:58.070 --> 25:00.322
-Well, the trucks--
-What about the trucks?

25:00.450 --> 25:03.032
The Sinaloans have them.
Our guys went to get them back.

25:03.120 --> 25:04.610
The Sinaloans have our fucking trucks?

25:04.710 --> 25:06.280
They reminded me of the arrangement.
They said that they--

25:06.370 --> 25:08.702
I know the fucking arrangement, Nstor.

25:14.090 --> 25:15.466
How long have they been gone?

25:16.760 --> 25:18.170
Since last night.

25:18.260 --> 25:19.636
-Cochiloco--
-Last night?

25:21.470 --> 25:23.097
And you're only telling me now?

25:24.270 --> 25:25.635
Are you fucking kidding?

25:25.730 --> 25:26.685
Relax, brother.

25:29.400 --> 25:30.970
Don't tell me to fucking relax.

25:31.070 --> 25:34.312
Did that shit you smoked
already rot your fucking brain?

25:34.400 --> 25:35.981
The longer this product stays here,

25:36.070 --> 25:38.903
the better the odds of something bad
happening to it. We lose it...

25:39.490 --> 25:40.400
we pay for it.

25:41.870 --> 25:45.249
If those fucking trucks aren't here
in five minutes...

25:47.870 --> 25:49.576
See, problem solved.

25:55.670 --> 25:56.921
Close the doors!

25:59.090 --> 26:00.341
What the fuck are you waiting for?

26:00.680 --> 26:02.887
Now get this shit loaded and out of here.

26:02.970 --> 26:04.130
Yes, boss.

26:04.220 --> 26:06.427
-Boss!
-What?

26:07.310 --> 26:08.686
I think there's something in there.

26:09.900 --> 26:11.049
What are you talking about?

26:18.410 --> 26:19.604
Open it up.

26:21.450 --> 26:23.441
-Fucking do it.
-Get moving.

26:34.250 --> 26:36.502
I get it. "Crazy Pig."

26:37.670 --> 26:38.796
That fucking...

26:39.260 --> 26:40.579
Cochiloco. ..

26:42.180 --> 26:44.000
and those fucking Sinaloan monkeys!

26:46.350 --> 26:48.511
They think this is a big fucking joke?

26:49.140 --> 26:50.721
I will shove this up their asses.

26:51.440 --> 26:53.931
We're done sharing our shit
with these assholes.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.890
If they have a problem with it...

26:58.320 --> 26:59.526
I'll fucking kill them.

27:00.780 --> 27:03.658
Nstor, get this fucking mess cleaned up
and ship the product.

27:03.740 --> 27:06.152
Yes, boss. What should we do with the pig?

27:08.290 --> 27:10.246
Ramn, shoot this fucking thing.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.200
What are you looking at?

27:15.630 --> 27:16.585
What's so funny?

27:38.610 --> 27:40.851
Mimi's like American royalty.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.525
Her uncle's a senator.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.155
Senator?

27:48.500 --> 27:49.398
Yeah.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.997
That's not a good thing.
You know that, right?

28:01.090 --> 28:03.001
A person can't help where they're born.

28:03.430 --> 28:04.636
Or to whom.

28:05.390 --> 28:08.097
Only how they live

28:08.180 --> 28:10.557
and who they are when they die.

28:11.890 --> 28:15.303
You're having very deep
fucking thoughts today.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.779
So you've decided to die here in Texas?

28:27.160 --> 28:29.902
Get yourself one. The bar's over there.

28:31.120 --> 28:32.747
Mimi was an art major.

28:34.370 --> 28:36.838
-Who did you say I looked like, baby?
-Van Gogh.

28:37.170 --> 28:38.831
That's right. Van Gogh.

28:38.920 --> 28:41.457
He cut off his ear then painted himself.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.829
Right?

28:47.350 --> 28:48.635
Very interesting.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.974
Hey, Mimi, do you think you can give us
some time alone? I need to talk to Pablo.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.305
Mimi knows about my business.

28:55.940 --> 28:57.430
Say what you need to say.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.521
Beyond the fact that...

29:04.490 --> 29:08.824
one of Mexico's most wanted traffickers
IS on U.S. soH...

29:09.620 --> 29:12.692
you also know that nothing is getting done
back in Jurez while you're gone.

29:13.250 --> 29:17.243
Nothing is getting built.
Product isn't moving.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.455
You see, baby?

29:20.880 --> 29:22.757
They need me back in Jurez.

29:22.840 --> 29:24.467
Of course they do, baby.

29:25.590 --> 29:27.330
Mimi doesn't want me to go back.

29:27.430 --> 29:29.045
She wants me here.

29:29.350 --> 29:32.171
Pablo should be able to do what he wants.

29:32.970 --> 29:37.395
I don't think Mimi understands
who you are and what you do.

29:38.270 --> 29:39.510
I don't know.

29:39.940 --> 29:41.350
Mimi understands a lot.

29:46.650 --> 29:48.982
The Colombians are going to think
we aren't serious about our business.

29:49.450 --> 29:51.020
Fuck the Colombians.

29:51.120 --> 29:54.192
-I don't work for them.
-No, but you work for Flix.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.668
New airstrips and storage were
supposed to be built by now.

29:58.750 --> 30:00.786
And none of it's happening, Pablo.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.836
That's you and Aguilar's shit.
You handle it.

30:02.920 --> 30:06.504
No way, asshole. You run the plaza.
The men take orders from you.

30:07.630 --> 30:09.040
There's a shitload of business
to take care of,

30:09.140 --> 30:10.846
and the guys aren't lifting
a fucking finger.

30:10.930 --> 30:12.921
Well, I got business to take care of
out here!

30:13.010 --> 30:14.511
Fixing roofs?

30:15.270 --> 30:17.431
I mean, in Ojinaga.

30:17.940 --> 30:20.010
I'm not going anywhere till it's resolved.

30:20.150 --> 30:23.358
What could you possibly need to resolve
in that shithole?

30:24.480 --> 30:26.186
Things you wouldn't understand.

30:26.610 --> 30:27.690
Try me.

30:29.280 --> 30:30.907
It's complicated.

30:31.530 --> 30:34.408
Some trouble between me and someone else.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.207
-Who?
-My business. None of your concern.

30:44.750 --> 30:48.538
You want me to get 50 men together
and pulverize this fucking guy?

30:50.890 --> 30:52.926
Knew you wouldn't get it.

30:54.600 --> 30:57.137
This is a feud between families.
Between men.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.879
It's about honor. And you have none.

31:01.310 --> 31:05.019
What kind of man [ets a bunch of
5/car/os
do his work for him?

31:05.230 --> 31:07.733
And who, besides ass-kissers like you,

31:07.820 --> 31:10.482
-would follow a man who did that?
-I'm serious, man.

31:10.740 --> 31:13.447
Whatever bullshit you gotta handle,
let's go fucking do it, right now.

31:13.530 --> 31:15.691
I'm not going back to Jurez without you.

34:16.840 --> 34:18.546
Ossie, come on.

35:07.810 --> 35:09.721
I'm gonna throw some hot water on you two.

35:10.310 --> 35:11.470
No shame.

35:13.650 --> 35:14.810
I'm here.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.060
Good afternoon, Don Juan.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.519
How's it going, boss?

35:20.610 --> 35:22.407
Look at these beautiful horses.

35:22.950 --> 35:24.440
Do you know how to ride one?

35:24.700 --> 35:25.655
Yes.

35:25.740 --> 35:26.820
That's good.

35:26.910 --> 35:29.788
There's a horse show tomorrow in town.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.571
We provide many of the horses
for the children.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.081
Esperanza!

35:35.380 --> 35:37.291
Look who I brought you!

35:37.380 --> 35:38.290
Woman!

35:43.010 --> 35:44.295
My queen.

35:44.930 --> 35:47.137
So beautiful. Come here.

35:53.060 --> 35:55.142
-My Esperanza.
-Nice to meet you.

35:55.230 --> 35:57.858
-Miguel ngel Flix Gallardo.
-Nice to meet you.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.776
So is that bridge still there?

36:00.860 --> 36:02.566
Here we go again.

36:02.660 --> 36:04.446
She takes it for granted.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.111
But we know differently, don't we?

36:06.910 --> 36:08.036
Kids!

36:09.580 --> 36:11.901
Now that Grandpa is back, we can start.

36:12.000 --> 36:15.037
All the kids are here!

36:15.170 --> 36:17.707
-Grandpa! Grandpa!
-Here you go.

36:17.800 --> 36:19.586
A little present.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.461
Let's go have a beer.

36:25.720 --> 36:28.132
Am I drinking these alone or what?

37:06.720 --> 37:08.039
You love your country?

37:08.140 --> 37:10.461
-Bullshit.
-And what?

37:10.890 --> 37:14.519
The Americans give you your honor
because you work for them?

37:14.640 --> 37:17.097
You're their trained monkey.

37:17.310 --> 37:18.470
Their dog.

37:18.690 --> 37:21.523
And when they go home,

37:21.940 --> 37:24.738
they leave trash like you behind.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.066
And they fucking laugh at you.

37:28.240 --> 37:29.901
Nobody laughs at me.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.072
They do. But that's okay.

37:35.620 --> 37:37.997
Because when you and I meet up again...

37:38.500 --> 37:40.127
in a room like this...

37:41.710 --> 37:43.450
there won't be any laughing.

37:44.300 --> 37:48.543
I will hurt you in ways
you can't even imagine.

37:49.890 --> 37:53.462
I will find out what you care about.

37:54.180 --> 37:55.932
Who you care about.

37:56.810 --> 37:58.892
And then I will go to work on them.

38:00.650 --> 38:01.810
Mom...

38:02.730 --> 38:03.890
Dad...

38:05.070 --> 38:06.105
wife...

38:07.490 --> 38:08.605
kids...

38:09.450 --> 38:13.443
And when they ask me why I am doing
these awful things to them,

38:14.660 --> 38:16.070
I will tell them,

38:16.540 --> 38:20.032
"Because Danilo chose the Americans
over you."

40:47.940 --> 40:50.932
That's half the Brownsville
Sheriff's Department.

40:51.530 --> 40:53.066
Off duty, of course.

40:55.410 --> 40:58.527
-He's a very popular man.
-He is.

40:59.240 --> 41:01.492
He has the respect and love of his people.

41:01.580 --> 41:02.899
And their obedience.

41:03.290 --> 41:04.746
I'm Juan brego.

41:06.710 --> 41:07.950
The nephew.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.161
-I've heard of you.
-Rea|ly?

41:12.260 --> 41:15.377
-Yeah.
-And I've heard of you. Of course.

41:16.970 --> 41:18.540
Are you enjoying the party?

41:19.760 --> 41:21.637
I didn't come here for a party.

41:22.020 --> 41:24.341
I came to talk business with your uncle.

41:24.440 --> 41:25.475
Yes.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.352
You came to try to convince my uncle
to get into cocaine.

41:31.030 --> 41:34.852
My uncle is an opium trafficker.
A lot of years in that game.

41:34.950 --> 41:37.316
And for good reason.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.158
He knows that product is safe for us.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.076
We grow it.

41:43.290 --> 41:45.576
Harvest it. Control it.

41:45.830 --> 41:48.287
No Colombians to deal with.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.336
No airplanes through Honduras.

41:50.420 --> 41:54.459
But more importantly... no headlines.

41:56.800 --> 41:58.791
Cocaine scares America.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.349
And my uncle wants to keep
his American friends.

42:03.720 --> 42:07.224
So convincing my uncle won't be easy.

42:09.690 --> 42:11.066
And you? What do you think?

42:11.320 --> 42:14.608
I think there is only one reason
not to get into cocaine.

42:18.070 --> 42:19.025
You.

42:22.030 --> 42:24.863
Stop the music for a moment.

42:25.410 --> 42:31.497
The local children's choir has prepared
a song in gratitude for Juan Guerra.

42:31.840 --> 42:33.546
Go ahead, children.

43:29.850 --> 43:31.727
They even sing in English.

46:41.290 --> 46:44.509
And here is the guest of honor.

46:45.630 --> 46:48.713
I think you're always
the guest of honor here.

46:49.180 --> 46:50.169
Sure.

46:51.600 --> 46:53.056
Do you know why?

46:54.770 --> 46:58.934
Because I've been doing this a long time.

47:00.190 --> 47:02.818
What we've built here in the east
is nowhere near what you've built

47:02.900 --> 47:04.185
in the rest of the country.

47:05.440 --> 47:08.068
But it has all that I need.

47:09.450 --> 47:10.815
And none of what I don't.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.323
What you're asking of me, of my people...

47:16.500 --> 47:18.240
is a big deal.

47:20.670 --> 47:22.535
We aren't barbarians.

47:23.960 --> 47:25.086
I know that.

47:26.420 --> 47:27.705
That's why I'm here.

47:28.420 --> 47:29.796
Look, Miguel ngel,

47:30.130 --> 47:32.587
the opium business has been good to us.

47:33.640 --> 47:37.804
Lots of profits and reliable users
in the States.

47:38.060 --> 47:39.345
Most of them "undesirables."

47:40.390 --> 47:41.516
Blacks.

47:42.860 --> 47:44.475
Former soldiers.

47:46.020 --> 47:48.352
People the government
doesn't give a shit about.

47:49.990 --> 47:53.812
It makes it easier for the Americans
to look the other way.

47:55.370 --> 47:56.860
But cocaine?

47:57.290 --> 47:59.861
What? Scares the Americans?

48:01.290 --> 48:02.917
That's bullshit.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.628
What scares the Americans
IS how much they love It.

48:06.130 --> 48:08.086
They're obsessed with that shit.

48:08.420 --> 48:10.718
America will get its cocaine.

48:11.050 --> 48:14.338
One way or another.
Better that it's through us.

48:14.970 --> 48:15.925
Us?

48:17.060 --> 48:18.129
Us?

48:20.520 --> 48:22.385
My nephew likes cocaine.

48:22.480 --> 48:26.644
He doesn't care that famous people
are killing themselves on it.

48:26.820 --> 48:29.892
He likes the margins, you know?
How can you not?

48:31.860 --> 48:35.318
But do you know why we never got into it?

48:35.780 --> 48:37.691
Because of people like you.

48:39.200 --> 48:43.318
We saw what you did to your partners,
let alone your competitors.

48:44.750 --> 48:46.741
And now you're inviting us in?

48:47.880 --> 48:50.371
So I have to ask myself,
"Why am I so luclq?"

48:53.720 --> 48:55.836
A white storm is coming.

48:56.970 --> 48:59.803
They will try to stop it,
but they will fail.

49:01.890 --> 49:04.097
The Caribbean corridor is closing forever.

49:04.270 --> 49:05.840
No one can change that.

49:07.730 --> 49:09.357
When that happens,
we will be the only way in.

49:09.440 --> 49:13.069
With your eastern network
repurposed for cocaine...

49:13.780 --> 49:15.190
fuck".

49:15.700 --> 49:17.315
we can take full advantage.

49:19.240 --> 49:20.286
What do you need?

49:20.490 --> 49:21.570
A union.

49:22.830 --> 49:26.288
More cocaine means more money.
A fucking monopoly.

49:26.540 --> 49:28.496
Where we set the terms.

49:29.090 --> 49:31.240
-More money means--
-The future.

49:33.470 --> 49:34.869
What about the past?

49:36.090 --> 49:37.216
For example,

49:37.760 --> 49:41.002
the thing with the agent, Camarena.

49:41.970 --> 49:44.347
I have a lot of people
on the other side of the border.

49:44.980 --> 49:48.268
They won't like me being
in business with...

49:49.480 --> 49:51.311
someone who killed one of theirs.

49:52.730 --> 49:53.810
What do I tell them?

49:55.650 --> 49:57.652
Tell them what everyone already knows...

49:59.370 --> 50:01.110
the men responsible are behind bars.

50:04.450 --> 50:07.248
That might work with people
who don't care about the truth.

50:07.330 --> 50:11.084
Tell them that there is more money
to be made.

50:11.170 --> 50:12.205
Money?

50:12.670 --> 50:13.705
Is that all?

50:15.220 --> 50:19.042
You have money, Miguel ngel.
I have money. They have money.

50:19.720 --> 50:21.756
You're talking about more money.

50:23.430 --> 50:25.227
At a cost that I'm not willing to pay.

50:27.140 --> 50:29.438
I'm sorry that you wasted your time.

50:29.520 --> 50:30.805
Sit down!

50:32.480 --> 50:35.142
You want to know what I need, right?

50:35.400 --> 50:37.527
Okay, then, I'll tell you, Don Juan.

50:38.030 --> 50:39.657
I need leverage.

50:41.910 --> 50:43.866
I saw what you wanted me to see.

50:43.950 --> 50:45.906
It's fucking great. What did you say?

50:46.000 --> 50:48.491
"The love and respect of his friends."

50:48.580 --> 50:51.663
The Americans put on a good show.
You have them in your pocket.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.455
Impressive.

50:54.550 --> 50:56.666
But don't act stupid, Don Juan.

50:58.180 --> 50:59.545
You're small-time.

51:04.100 --> 51:05.385
And so am I.

51:07.680 --> 51:08.840
You told me...

51:09.350 --> 51:12.513
that I brought my people, my federation,
out of the darkness.

51:14.020 --> 51:16.568
Well, that's true.
But the darkness is still there.

51:16.650 --> 51:19.357
And if the Colombians have their way,
we would slide back into it.

51:19.450 --> 51:22.408
All of us. You too. With all your friends.
Your people. Chopping each other to bits.

51:24.910 --> 51:27.037
This whole country is one step away
from chaos.

51:27.660 --> 51:31.414
A fucking free-for-all of independent
operators who think they can go it alone.

51:31.790 --> 51:34.167
And the Colombians love it.

51:35.210 --> 51:37.917
They would rather deal with us separately.

51:38.670 --> 51:42.003
Play us off of one another. Keep us under
their thumb by paying us slowly.

51:45.060 --> 51:50.225
We're middlemen to them.
Baggage handlers.

51:50.350 --> 51:52.181
We deliver their coke across
that fucking border

51:52.270 --> 51:54.682
to more Colombians waiting
on the other side

51:54.770 --> 51:56.647
so they can mark it up and sell it
for ten times the money.

51:58.110 --> 52:00.647
But we are the only ones
who can move their shit,

52:01.110 --> 52:03.192
so we should be able to rewrite the rules.

52:03.620 --> 52:05.690
It's time we tell them
how It's gomg to be.

52:12.750 --> 52:14.832
Finally, here's the man
I've been waiting to see,

52:15.040 --> 52:16.951
the man I've heard so much about.

52:18.800 --> 52:19.835
Very well.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.120
And this leverage?

52:22.220 --> 52:23.630
What would we do with it?

52:23.970 --> 52:26.803
We force them to start paying us
in cocaine. We get into retail.

52:28.720 --> 52:31.223
What'd I tell you, Juan?
This guy is a genius.

52:31.850 --> 52:33.511
Why would the Colombians let us do that?

52:33.600 --> 52:36.262
They won't have a choice.
Flix will have a monopoly.

52:36.480 --> 52:38.562
When they want to negotiate,

52:39.320 --> 52:41.390
fine, we'll negotiate.

52:42.320 --> 52:43.651
What would we ask for?

52:43.990 --> 52:45.867
We keep half the loads.

52:47.080 --> 52:49.287
And then we start selling it ourselves,
up north, using our people.

52:49.370 --> 52:51.702
How many Colombians in the States?

52:51.790 --> 52:53.246
No more than 800,000.

52:53.330 --> 52:54.536
And our people?

52:57.090 --> 52:58.796
At least 15 million.

53:03.220 --> 53:05.006
Well, I am impressed.

53:09.430 --> 53:12.012
I have to say,
I thought I had figured you out.

53:12.350 --> 53:14.341
You've surprised me, young man.

53:15.230 --> 53:16.094
I'm glad.

53:16.400 --> 53:17.685
Just one thing.

53:18.480 --> 53:20.107
You have a lot of enemies.

53:21.820 --> 53:22.809
I get it.

53:23.700 --> 53:28.148
But a man isn't defined by his enemies.
He is defined by his friends.

53:29.200 --> 53:30.360
His family.

53:31.040 --> 53:32.189
His people.

53:33.290 --> 53:34.609
From now on...

53:36.630 --> 53:38.200
my family is yours.

53:42.920 --> 53:43.966
Partners?

53:44.380 --> 53:48.134
I need a few weeks.
I want my people to hear It from me.

53:49.800 --> 53:51.256
But yes...

53:51.970 --> 53:53.221
partners.

53:55.270 --> 53:56.976
That's great. Right?

53:57.100 --> 53:58.306
We got it done.

54:11.330 --> 54:14.868
Get out of the way. Here I come.

54:15.870 --> 54:19.533
Long live love, motherfuckers!

54:33.010 --> 54:37.686
WELCOME HOME

54:38.020 --> 54:40.147
Love the sign, bro.

54:40.230 --> 54:41.390
Thank you.

54:41.650 --> 54:43.390
I did it myself.

54:43.480 --> 54:45.391
But you've gotta try this shit.

54:45.490 --> 54:47.105
It's called crack.

54:47.700 --> 54:49.156
Let me heat it up.

54:49.740 --> 54:52.447
I spent 18 months drinking wine
made in a toilet.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.439
Hey, my little witch.

54:56.450 --> 54:58.748
Welcome home, brother.

55:00.130 --> 55:01.199
Popeye.

55:03.960 --> 55:05.791
This is my man, David Barron.

55:05.880 --> 55:07.165
He's from San Diego.

55:07.590 --> 55:11.629
This motherfucker had my back
on the inside.

55:11.800 --> 55:12.960
He's family.

55:13.640 --> 55:15.596
Welcome to Tijuana, bro.

55:16.730 --> 55:18.095
So from San Diego?

55:18.180 --> 55:19.226
Logan Heights.

55:20.650 --> 55:22.720
Oh, shit. Take it.

56:05.320 --> 56:06.560
What the fuck are you doing here?

56:08.440 --> 56:09.566
Oh, Min...

56:09.990 --> 56:12.527
is that any way to greet an old friend?

56:13.780 --> 56:15.441
Come on, a kiss.

56:16.790 --> 56:20.078
-If somebody sees you...
-Nobody saw me, don't worry.

56:21.370 --> 56:22.530
What do you want?

56:29.880 --> 56:31.416
To talk business.

56:35.890 --> 56:37.596
Wipe that stuff off your face, Tigre.

56:45.150 --> 56:46.686
Get up. Get out of here.

56:51.860 --> 56:53.100
Assholes.

56:57.330 --> 56:58.479
Who are those guys?

56:58.580 --> 57:00.320
Sinaloan crew.

57:02.580 --> 57:04.070
Trash.

57:04.500 --> 57:07.128
Ramn! Hey, kid.

57:09.090 --> 57:10.125
What's up, Ramn?

57:11.510 --> 57:14.252
-What are you doing here?
-This is our club. We own it.

57:14.800 --> 57:15.960
You really didn't know?

57:16.680 --> 57:17.886
Owners?

57:19.140 --> 57:20.676
Oh, man. Thank God, bro.

57:20.770 --> 57:23.056
I was worried it was a gay club.

57:25.100 --> 57:26.761
Did you guys get my present?

57:26.860 --> 57:30.148
You motherfuckers keep our trucks all day,

57:30.690 --> 57:32.601
fucking up our business,

57:32.990 --> 57:34.560
and then you come here
and disrespect us

57:34.650 --> 57:38.063
on the day my brother is released
from prison? What the fuck?

57:38.410 --> 57:40.196
Hey, quiet.

57:40.290 --> 57:41.780
Shut the fuck up.

57:42.750 --> 57:44.706
We're sorry. We didn't know.

57:45.040 --> 57:46.325
You're right.

57:47.210 --> 57:50.919
Cheers to your family, your brother,
and his continued freedom.

57:51.250 --> 57:54.003
And I'm sorry about the pig.
It was a joke.

57:54.510 --> 57:56.046
You can send it back if you don't want it.

57:56.130 --> 57:57.085
I shot it.

57:59.470 --> 58:00.880
Can't take a joke.

58:02.310 --> 58:04.767
Some dogs only behave on the leash.

58:05.810 --> 58:07.141
Cheers, kid.

58:09.270 --> 58:10.567
All good?

58:11.360 --> 58:12.725
Got them on a leash.

58:13.570 --> 58:14.980
-All good?
-Yes.

58:15.070 --> 58:16.981
What's the problem? Let's party.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.231
I have some cocaine to move.

58:20.950 --> 58:22.486
I'd like to move it through your plaza.

58:25.410 --> 58:27.116
Talk to Miguel ngel.

58:27.710 --> 58:30.747
It's such a small amount.

58:30.920 --> 58:32.797
I don't think Flix even needs to know.

58:33.130 --> 58:35.337
Besides, I'd much rather pay you
for the privilege

58:35.420 --> 58:37.081
than someone who...

58:37.340 --> 58:38.580
has no faith in me.

58:40.430 --> 58:42.307
That is, unless you're scared.

58:45.890 --> 58:47.881
I heard he threw himself a birthday party.

58:48.100 --> 58:49.306
Didn't invite me.

58:50.650 --> 58:53.608
Made you all attend too.

58:54.070 --> 58:56.061
Like peasants.

58:56.150 --> 59:00.063
Bro, I think maybe
you should come downstairs.

59:02.080 --> 59:06.323
Look, the only reason Flix didn't kill me
for the move we made against him

59:06.660 --> 59:08.491
is because he still needs me.

59:11.080 --> 59:14.083
The only reason he didn't kill you...

59:16.970 --> 59:18.835
is because you don't matter
in the slightest to him.

59:21.390 --> 59:24.382
For your sake, I'm going to pretend
we never had this conversation.

59:25.390 --> 59:27.221
You can go out the way you came in.

59:27.310 --> 59:28.550
Don't let anyone see you.

59:57.380 --> 59:58.540
Bring the stretcher!

1:00:24.070 --> 1:00:25.480
We brought you a present.

1:00:26.160 --> 1:00:28.321
A toast, to your family.

1:00:28.450 --> 1:00:30.498
To blood and the ties which bond us.

1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:32.240
Cheers!

1:00:33.920 --> 1:00:36.206
And to Francisco Arellano Flix,

1:00:36.290 --> 1:00:38.292
who sucked more dicks than any inmate

1:00:38.380 --> 1:00:40.507
in the history of the California
prison system!

1:00:57.940 --> 1:00:59.146
What?

1:01:03.450 --> 1:01:04.815
Motherfucker!

1:01:56.170 --> 1:01:57.876
Welcome back, boss.

1:01:58.380 --> 1:01:59.495
It go well?

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:01.705
It did. Very.

1:02:01.800 --> 1:02:03.085
Good.

1:02:03.460 --> 1:02:05.587
Did the
seora
eat yet?

1:02:05.680 --> 1:02:09.719
She took Amalia to Cuernavaca
for the night with some friends.

1:02:13.020 --> 1:02:13.975
Good.

1:02:14.770 --> 1:02:15.976
Can I get you anything?

1:02:16.600 --> 1:02:18.511
No, I'm good.

1:02:20.020 --> 1:02:21.647
Okay. Good night.
