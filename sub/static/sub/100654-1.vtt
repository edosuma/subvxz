WEBVTT

00:14.971 --> 00:17.234
[epic music]

01:02.497 --> 01:05.891
[woman] There has to be a reason
He sent us here.

01:06.849 --> 01:09.504
I just wonder if it was
the big salary that lured me.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.593
You made the right decision.

01:12.159 --> 01:14.944
We both agreed this was right
for our daughters.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.383
I'm just struggling.

01:21.037 --> 01:24.867
I went from saving an embassy
and killing terrorists to now

01:24.910 --> 01:27.957
being the head of security
at a research lab.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.091
Daddy! Look at that one!
It looks like an elephant!

01:31.134 --> 01:34.181
[chuckles] It sure does.

01:34.224 --> 01:37.749
That one-- That looks like
it has a witch's face.

01:37.793 --> 01:40.100
-You see it?
-I see it!

01:42.232 --> 01:45.627
You may not be saving the world,
but you're a hero to them,

01:46.671 --> 01:48.978
[British accent] and you're
my hero too, darling.

01:49.021 --> 01:51.459
[both laugh]

01:51.502 --> 01:53.156
That British accent.

01:57.900 --> 02:00.598
-Hey. You okay?
-[dramatic music]

02:01.860 --> 02:06.430
[tearfully] I'm having
this feeling that God

02:06.474 --> 02:11.435
is about to do something
really miraculous through you.

02:15.526 --> 02:18.660
-[horn honks]
-[car crash sounds]

02:20.966 --> 02:23.795
[epic music]

02:34.545 --> 02:38.419
[indistinct whispers]

02:38.462 --> 02:41.726
[breathes heavily]

02:41.770 --> 02:45.165
[giggling]

02:54.957 --> 02:57.568
[glass shattering]

02:57.612 --> 03:01.355
[indistinct whispers]

03:02.051 --> 03:05.881
[breathes heavily]

03:15.107 --> 03:22.245
[quietly] No. No. No. no.

03:22.289 --> 03:24.769
[explosion]

03:37.129 --> 03:39.001
[slow music]

03:50.795 --> 03:52.841
[man] One minute left
to turn in your test.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.409
[sighs] When two
quantum objects, photons,

03:55.452 --> 03:57.280
share the same wave functions
and occupy

03:57.324 --> 03:59.413
the same space and time,
they are...

03:59.456 --> 04:02.285
identical, and what happens
to one, in theory,

04:02.329 --> 04:05.114
would happen
to the other. Yes.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.551
-Oop. Sorry. Sorry.
-It's okay.

04:15.559 --> 04:16.517
Sorry again.

04:17.430 --> 04:18.867
Stay.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.702
I'm really sorry.
I get hyper focused,

04:27.745 --> 04:30.313
and sometimes self-absorbed.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.882
I get it. That might have been
the toughest test

04:33.925 --> 04:36.450
-I've ever taken.
-Pretty sure I aced it.

04:36.493 --> 04:39.670
No one's ever going
to ace this test.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.803
-I'll be the first.
-Oh, really?

04:41.846 --> 04:44.327
-And just who are you?
-Ram Goldstein.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.634
Amy Lee.

04:47.199 --> 04:49.376
If you're
so brilliantly smart,

04:49.419 --> 04:51.029
how come I've never
heard of you?

04:51.073 --> 04:53.989
I graduated MIT
over five years ago.

04:54.032 --> 04:55.860
I do contract work
out of my basement.

04:55.904 --> 04:57.514
-[bell ringing]
-So you live with your parents?

04:57.558 --> 04:58.689
[chuckles]

05:00.082 --> 05:02.432
Well, it's kind of like
a financial arrangement.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.347
Um, more
like they live with me.

05:04.391 --> 05:06.654
Well, maybe if you're
in the top four scores,

05:06.697 --> 05:08.351
you can make
half a million a year,

05:08.395 --> 05:10.048
you can afford to move out.

05:10.092 --> 05:11.746
It's actually
a reduction in my income,

05:11.789 --> 05:14.357
but I'm fascinated
by the prospects.

05:14.401 --> 05:18.013
Hmm.
Bet you dinner tonight

05:18.056 --> 05:21.843
-you didn't ace the test. Deal?
-Yes. No. I mean,

05:21.886 --> 05:24.236
the scores won't be tabulated
until next week.

05:24.280 --> 05:27.457
-We won't be able to--
-Ram? It wasn't really
about the scores.

05:29.677 --> 05:30.591
And you're buying.

05:32.201 --> 05:34.290
But I don't have your number.

05:37.162 --> 05:38.033
[Amy] Your parents?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.252
Yeah.

05:41.428 --> 05:43.081
Don't worry. They're not home.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.996
[sighs] Well, that's a relief.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.434
No telling
what we might get into.

05:47.477 --> 05:49.044
[chuckles]

05:49.087 --> 05:51.481
[chuckles] Well, ready
to go to dinner?

05:53.091 --> 05:54.484
I thought we might eat here.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.099
How do you like your steak?

06:09.020 --> 06:11.109
I'm sorry if this
is a disappointment.

06:11.153 --> 06:12.807
I don't really get out much.

06:12.850 --> 06:16.158
N- I'm sorry
if I hurt your feelings.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.942
If this were easy for you,

06:17.986 --> 06:19.596
it wouldn't mean near as much.

06:23.034 --> 06:26.734
-Well, let's eat.
-Wait.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.436
Lord... Uh...

06:34.219 --> 06:36.439
We're just praying.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.616
Oh. Yeah. Wait, I- I don't--

06:39.660 --> 06:41.009
Just a dinner prayer.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.186
[soft music]

07:44.899 --> 07:46.814
[sighing]

07:46.857 --> 07:48.250
[dramatic music]

08:03.526 --> 08:06.486
[tearfully] I just want
my family back.

08:10.315 --> 08:13.014
[cries] Why?

08:13.057 --> 08:14.363
[cries]

08:26.375 --> 08:27.594
[gun cocking]

08:29.030 --> 08:30.379
[gun clatters]

08:46.308 --> 08:47.701
I am not a coward.

08:50.312 --> 08:54.055
[breathes shakily]
But I served you.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.233
I played this life
by your rules.

08:58.276 --> 09:01.802
I've done everything
that you've ever asked of me.

09:02.585 --> 09:06.067
You take my family.
What kind of God are you?

09:07.503 --> 09:09.592
[breathing shakily]

09:15.598 --> 09:17.557
[fireplace crackling]

09:36.967 --> 09:40.014
[cries quietly]
I am not yours anymore.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.276
Do you hear me?

09:43.495 --> 09:46.934
I am not your guy anymore.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.981
[Amy] It took them three months
to make the announcement,

09:51.025 --> 09:53.027
-but we're finally famous.
-Ah, yeah!

09:53.070 --> 09:55.290
About time somebody
recognized my greatness.

09:55.333 --> 09:56.683
You mean besides yourself?

09:59.250 --> 10:01.383
"The Institute
of Matter Transfer Sciences

10:01.426 --> 10:03.211
owned by Ahmed Akbar,

10:03.254 --> 10:04.691
the world's most famous refugee,

10:04.734 --> 10:06.693
hires four young geniuses."

10:06.736 --> 10:09.260
One that is
incredibly good looking.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.785
"They will compete
against five other teams

10:11.828 --> 10:14.091
to attempt to complete the first

10:14.135 --> 10:15.615
matter transfer machine."

10:18.226 --> 10:20.402
"The team is led
by Ram Goldstein,

10:20.445 --> 10:22.186
the only person to ever ace

10:22.230 --> 10:24.754
Ahmed's matter transfer
I.Q. test."

10:24.798 --> 10:27.539
-Told you.
-Okay, we've all heard
that a hundred times.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.933
"Amy Lee, Simon Jefferson..."

10:29.977 --> 10:31.500
and, me, Felix Martinez.

10:31.543 --> 10:33.415
Oh. There's a picture,

10:34.590 --> 10:37.027
-but they made me hide Happy.
-Thank God.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.682
We don't need the whole world
thinking we a bunch of nerds.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.511
Just because we're geniuses
don't mean we can't be cool.

10:42.554 --> 10:45.557
This is gonna look great
on our rÃ©sumÃ©s.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.212
We won't be needing rÃ©sumÃ©s
if we can't get this completed.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.736
How 'bout
getting back to work?

10:51.520 --> 10:53.609
Ram, if you the smartest dude
in the world,

10:54.175 --> 10:56.699
how come you can't figure out
we need to chill out
every now and then?

10:56.743 --> 10:59.006
Simon, can you focus
for just a few minutes?

10:59.049 --> 11:00.355
I really need to test
this algorithm.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.139
Another algorithm?

11:02.183 --> 11:03.967
You're killing us.
We need a break.

11:04.011 --> 11:06.578
You always got some big,
new idea--

11:06.622 --> 11:08.624
a bunch of flashing lights,

11:08.668 --> 11:09.930
and nothing moves.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.369
I'll bet you a steak dinner
nothing happens.

11:14.412 --> 11:17.372
Don't be messing around. The one
time this works, and, boom,

11:17.415 --> 11:20.288
your molecules
will be splattered
all over the universe.

11:20.331 --> 11:21.202
Clear.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.685
Seriously, Simon! Clear!

11:32.039 --> 11:34.737
-The chair!
-[groans] It ain't going
nowhere.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.608
Put the rubber ball
on the pad.

11:36.652 --> 11:38.785
Remember, we get
a two million dollar bonus

11:38.828 --> 11:40.134
if we get this thing to work.

11:40.177 --> 11:41.570
Transport the chair.

11:45.792 --> 11:47.924
Every time you pray,
and nothing ever happens.

11:47.968 --> 11:51.232
-Don't mock me.
-You're right. I'm sorry.

11:51.275 --> 11:52.886
Just because I believe
in science doesn't give me

11:52.929 --> 11:54.322
the right to make fun
of your belief.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.585
God works
in mysterious ways,

11:56.628 --> 11:59.022
and He might just be
working through you.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.415
Have you ever thought
about that?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.938
Yeah, for about this long.

12:01.982 --> 12:03.635
-[fingers snap]
-[grunts]

12:05.028 --> 12:06.464
Okay, let's give it a shot.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.163
Come on, steak dinner.

12:09.206 --> 12:11.513
[whirring / static]

12:21.653 --> 12:22.785
Get down!

12:22.829 --> 12:24.744
[explosion]

12:30.837 --> 12:31.794
You nasty.

12:32.969 --> 12:34.710
Can I at least get cleaned up?

12:34.754 --> 12:36.712
You are not to speak
to anyone

12:36.756 --> 12:39.062
or leave this area
until Ahmed arrives.

12:39.106 --> 12:41.499
This is so bad.
The man himself is coming.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.284
Less than three months
on the job,

12:43.327 --> 12:44.633
and we are toast.

12:45.460 --> 12:46.809
At least we're alive.

12:48.419 --> 12:52.075
-This was a good gig for me.
-I'm sorry, guys. This is on me.

12:52.119 --> 12:54.599
I'll take the blame,
and maybe they'll keep
you guys on board.

12:54.643 --> 12:57.689
Blowing up a lab doesn't
necessarily mean
we're being fired, right?

12:58.342 --> 13:00.736
I mean, that's what
scientists do sometimes.

13:01.519 --> 13:03.870
Hey, don't worry, Ram.

13:04.653 --> 13:05.872
Ahmed is a good man.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.832
He always takes care
of his people. Hmm?

13:17.884 --> 13:20.843
-You guys blew up my lab.
[chuckles]
-It was my fault.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.106
I should have followed
the protocol.

13:23.150 --> 13:26.109
I accept the consequences
for my actions.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.242
Ram Goldstein.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.027
The man who aced my test.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.682
It makes perfect sense
that you would do this.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.466
They didn't know
what I was doing.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.123
Maybe you should tell me
what the consequences should be.

13:41.646 --> 13:43.431
Watch this video and tell me

13:43.474 --> 13:45.825
exactly how you think
I should handle this.

13:45.868 --> 13:46.782
Press "play."

13:51.700 --> 13:53.789
It moved to the other pad!

13:53.833 --> 13:57.662
Two quantum objects occupying
the same wave should coexist.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.230
What happens to one happens
to the other. Both chairs--

14:00.274 --> 14:03.190
You four have done something
in less than three months

14:03.233 --> 14:06.280
that none of my best teams
have been able to do in years.

14:06.323 --> 14:11.111
Sabeer, seal this
room exactly as it is.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.591
This is history in the making.

14:14.375 --> 14:18.379
You four will be famous
for creating matter transfer.

14:18.988 --> 14:21.991
Follow me.
You are now my top team.

14:23.775 --> 14:26.430
[giggles]
We're gonna be famous!

14:26.474 --> 14:28.519
Hey, Ram, you know I was
kidding about that steak
dinner, right?

14:29.346 --> 14:31.000
[epic music]

14:31.696 --> 14:32.959
[door whirring]

14:38.529 --> 14:41.837
[chuckles] Oh, snaps!
This is nice!

14:42.664 --> 14:44.753
This is your new home.

14:44.796 --> 14:48.104
You'll have the finest equipment
and all the resources you need.

14:48.148 --> 14:50.933
Pull this off, and there will be
a ten million dollar bonus

14:50.977 --> 14:54.110
-for each of you.
-[chuckles] I'm down for that.

14:54.154 --> 14:55.764
Each? Let's get started.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.853
I think a shower
is in order.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.986
[chuckles] And then take
the rest of the evening off.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.597
You expect Ram
to take the night off?

15:02.640 --> 15:03.728
That would be great.

15:03.772 --> 15:05.208
Wouldn't it, Ram?

15:05.252 --> 15:07.080
Or we could start
getting work now?

15:07.123 --> 15:08.516
[chuckles]

15:08.559 --> 15:10.910
It's a big project. Uh...

15:10.953 --> 15:11.998
Okay, we'll take the night off.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.176
-[knocking on door]
-[Ahmed] Come in.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.742
[buzzer]

15:22.008 --> 15:24.358
-Reporting for duty, sir.
-Captain Brandt.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.837
Please, sit down.

15:28.797 --> 15:33.062
-Again, we're sorry for the loss
of your wife and daughters.
-Yeah.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.716
-How are you?
-I'm fine.

15:39.329 --> 15:42.289
It's only been a few weeks.
Don't you need
some more time off?

15:42.332 --> 15:44.421
If it's all right with you,
sir, I prefer to stay busy.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.945
-[knocking on door]
-Enter!

15:48.948 --> 15:51.080
What do you need me to do
about the explosion?

15:51.124 --> 15:52.690
I've got it handled.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.432
Sabeer, I wasn't talking to you.

15:55.476 --> 15:58.696
Look, we're on the verge
of something big.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.264
Nothing is more important than
the secrecy of this project.

16:01.308 --> 16:03.223
I'll make sure
that it stays secure.

16:03.266 --> 16:05.747
Did you hire the security team
that I advised?

16:05.790 --> 16:06.748
Yes.

16:09.055 --> 16:11.927
I have Champion National
Security officers everywhere.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.930
Perfect. I'll take over
coordinating them with our team.

16:14.974 --> 16:19.065
That's fine. I just don't want
them knowing anything
about our project.

16:19.108 --> 16:21.067
Keep them on the perimeter.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.678
Seriously,
take all the time you need.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.853
It is important to grieve.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.421
[dramatic music]

16:28.204 --> 16:30.032
[sighs] The more time
I take to think about it,

16:32.643 --> 16:36.038
-[sighs] the angrier
I get with God.
-Because he did not stop it?

16:36.082 --> 16:39.346
Didn't stop it--
caused it, allowed it.

16:40.521 --> 16:41.957
It doesn't really matter.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.092
My family's dead,
and He did nothing.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.964
No father
should ever have to bury

16:50.139 --> 16:53.447
-his own children.
-Again, we are sorry
for your loss.

16:54.796 --> 16:58.582
I felt the same way
when I lost my parents.

17:03.413 --> 17:05.111
Have mercy.

17:05.154 --> 17:08.940
[cries] No! No! Mom!

17:08.983 --> 17:13.118
You defy Allah,
and to declare yourselves
as Christians,

17:13.162 --> 17:15.164
the penalty is death.

17:15.208 --> 17:18.253
No! Dad! No! No!

17:18.863 --> 17:21.823
No! Mom! No! No!

17:23.215 --> 17:25.827
-Glory to Allah!
-[gunfire]

17:25.869 --> 17:28.047
[foreign yelling]

17:36.142 --> 17:40.189
[breathes heavily] Bring him.
He'll pay for this.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.017
[Brandt] If it's all right
with you, sir, can we-

17:42.061 --> 17:43.236
Can we please move on?

17:44.237 --> 17:45.586
Sure.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.067
While you were away,
I put Sabeer in charge.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.851
Let's keep it that way
for a few weeks.

17:49.894 --> 17:51.983
That way, you can come
and go without stress.

17:52.027 --> 17:54.638
I don't think it's smart to have
Sabeer in charge of anything.

17:55.335 --> 17:57.598
-Ever.
-It's only for a few more weeks.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.427
You're the boss.

18:09.436 --> 18:10.437
[clears throat]

18:14.397 --> 18:15.920
[typing sounds]

18:22.666 --> 18:25.452
[sighs] This is a lot harder
than I thought.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.455
It's only been a few weeks.

18:28.498 --> 18:29.891
Don't be so hard on yourself.

18:35.201 --> 18:39.074
You know, I think
I might know the problem.

18:48.344 --> 18:49.911
Come look at this.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.702
Hey. Hey.

19:04.752 --> 19:06.362
What are they doing?

19:06.406 --> 19:07.624
[kissing sounds]

19:10.236 --> 19:12.194
Working in the server room is
my favorite part of the day.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.979
-So this is work?
-Don't twist my words.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.765
-You know what I mean.
-Seriously,

19:17.808 --> 19:19.549
why do we have to hide?

19:19.593 --> 19:22.987
There are cameras
and microphones everywhere.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.338
-It's just awkward.
-You mean like this?

19:27.818 --> 19:29.429
Get some mics in there.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.561
I want to know
what they're saying.

19:35.130 --> 19:37.306
[beeping / whirring / static]

19:38.046 --> 19:40.091
-That's perplexing.
-What?

19:40.875 --> 19:42.442
I'm about to find out.

19:43.747 --> 19:44.922
What are you doing?

19:46.576 --> 19:49.231
Someone's using a secure line
to communicate with the outside.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.580
I'm gonna find out who.

19:52.539 --> 19:53.975
[Amy] Oh, my gosh.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.585
That's Rashaad Emir?

19:55.629 --> 19:56.891
[Amy] Who's he talking to?

20:00.895 --> 20:02.157
[Ram] Ahmed.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.073
Give me a progress report.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.815
We can use it in its current
state, but it's not stable.

20:07.858 --> 20:10.774
How is the situation
with the American?

20:10.818 --> 20:14.648
-He's under control.
-[coughs] Everything explodes

20:14.691 --> 20:17.825
when you transfer it.
Isn't that what we want?

20:17.868 --> 20:20.567
Yes, but if these kids
keep doing their job,

20:20.610 --> 20:22.351
it won't be long
before we can transfer

20:22.395 --> 20:24.310
supplies, bombs, and more.

20:24.353 --> 20:26.747
We can strike
any GPS coordinate.

20:26.790 --> 20:32.100
-Perfect. Make sure
you get this right.
-Got it.

20:32.143 --> 20:36.147
Extremists
killed Ahmed's parents.
Why would he work with them?

20:36.191 --> 20:38.193
It must be Stockholm Syndrome.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.369
-We have to tell the FBI.
-Wait.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.330
If they find out,
they'll kill us. They trace
our phone calls and texts.

20:45.156 --> 20:47.898
Just act like nothing happened.
Once we're off their property,

20:47.942 --> 20:49.465
I'll contact Homeland Security.

20:56.385 --> 20:59.997
[sighs] I'm fried.
This is hopeless.

21:00.041 --> 21:02.130
Einstein, test item
four thirty-five.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.045
-Initiate.
-[electrical sounds]

21:04.088 --> 21:05.786
[computer] Initiating transfer.

21:11.400 --> 21:14.316
-I don't know what's wrong.
-What's wrong is you keep trying

21:14.360 --> 21:17.363
the same equations
over and over again. Hmm?

21:17.406 --> 21:19.190
Isn't that a definition
of insanity?

21:19.974 --> 21:24.021
You're right.
Let me see if I can think
of something else to try.

21:25.675 --> 21:29.462
Weight, distance, photons,
matter, volume.

21:29.505 --> 21:33.248
To transfer from there
to here requires energy,

21:33.292 --> 21:36.904
wavelength, distance,
and GPS coordinates.
I've covered every variation.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.297
What's missing?

21:40.081 --> 21:43.345
I carried the ball over,
and it took--

21:43.954 --> 21:46.261
It's gonna take a few seconds
for the ball

21:46.305 --> 21:49.264
to get from there to here.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.313
If I don't compensate
for those seconds, then
I'm trying to send the ball...

21:56.184 --> 21:57.881
into the past.

22:00.057 --> 22:02.843
Uh, you guys look fried.
I have an idea.

22:02.886 --> 22:04.801
-[door panel beeps]
-Lunchtime!

22:04.845 --> 22:06.107
What? It's only eleven.

22:06.890 --> 22:09.240
[Ram]
Yeah, but, hey, I'm hungry.

22:09.284 --> 22:12.113
Aren't you?
Come on, let's go.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.202
Here we go.

22:14.245 --> 22:16.944
I have to use the restroom.
I'll meet you guys down there.

22:22.428 --> 22:24.691
-What are you doing?
-I can do it.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.301
No, you can't.

22:27.824 --> 22:29.696
Do you know what happens
if you're successful?

22:29.739 --> 22:32.655
Don't worry.
They won't catch me.

22:32.699 --> 22:36.050
[sighs] Be careful.

22:39.401 --> 22:41.838
[door panel beeps / whirring]

22:47.844 --> 22:50.760
Einstein, test item four
thirty-six. Initiate.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.936
-[whirring]
- Initiating transfer.

22:55.112 --> 22:56.636
One point four-five-two seconds.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.379
If I want matter to transfer,
I have to compensate.

23:12.303 --> 23:15.698
Einstein, test item
four thirty-seven. Initiate.

23:15.742 --> 23:17.439
Initiating transfer.

23:17.483 --> 23:20.137
[whirring]

23:24.925 --> 23:26.579
[sighs]

23:29.582 --> 23:31.192
He's hiding something.

23:32.672 --> 23:33.934
Get me some more camera angles.

23:41.594 --> 23:42.464
Another one.

23:56.304 --> 23:57.610
Time travel.

24:12.538 --> 24:13.756
[door whirring]

24:14.365 --> 24:16.542
Step away from the computer!

24:16.585 --> 24:17.934
He said, step away!

24:18.631 --> 24:19.719
[grunts]

24:22.678 --> 24:25.115
You have some explaining to do.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.771
This makes me rather curious.

24:29.729 --> 24:31.992
In my wildest expectations,
I would have never figured

24:32.035 --> 24:34.255
that you would create
time travel.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.562
Yet somehow, you've done it.

24:37.301 --> 24:40.174
My mind is racing
with the possibilities.

24:40.827 --> 24:44.570
You're gonna be famous
and very, very rich.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.223
It's not gonna happen.

24:46.267 --> 24:48.835
Look, you've
been working for me,

24:48.878 --> 24:52.665
you've been compensated by me.
Everything you create
belongs to me.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.971
Your contract
makes that very clear.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.278
Transferring matter
was bad enough.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.062
But time travel in your hands...

24:59.846 --> 25:02.152
I guess Sabeer
and Kabil were right.

25:02.196 --> 25:03.806
You've been spying on me.

25:04.807 --> 25:08.245
But don't get me wrong. All
I want is to go back in time

25:08.289 --> 25:10.683
and stop the men
that killed my parents.

25:10.726 --> 25:13.207
You would do the same
if someone killed your parents.
Wouldn't you?

25:13.250 --> 25:17.777
Of course.
But changing time would create
an overriding time continuum.

25:17.820 --> 25:19.779
So? No one would know
the difference. Who cares?

25:19.822 --> 25:22.303
If you change history
in the slightest way,

25:22.346 --> 25:24.871
you, me,
we might not even exist.

25:24.914 --> 25:27.351
The benefits outweigh the risks.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.658
What if I could kill Hitler
before he came to power?

25:29.702 --> 25:32.922
-Wouldn't you do that?
-Imagine the world
today without Hitler.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.969
Who's to say
the next guy wouldn't be
even more destructive?

25:36.012 --> 25:39.059
Perhaps Allah
wants me to work through him
to make things right.

25:39.102 --> 25:42.062
Perhaps you can explain why
Allah let Hitler rise to power

25:42.105 --> 25:45.021
in the first place
if He now has to use you
to correct his mistake.

25:45.065 --> 25:46.936
How dare you insult Allah?

25:53.421 --> 25:55.075
I thought I could be reasonable.

25:55.945 --> 25:58.992
I guess I'll have to resort
to something much more painful.

25:59.035 --> 26:01.777
-[static buzzing]
-[groaning]

26:03.039 --> 26:04.867
Take him
to the confinement room.

26:04.911 --> 26:06.695
I've got to talk to Rashaad.

26:06.739 --> 26:09.132
A time machine
changes everything.

26:10.351 --> 26:11.482
[grunts]

26:26.846 --> 26:28.717
[muffled grunting]

26:28.761 --> 26:30.501
What? I can't hear you.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.462
If you're gonna gag somebody,
you should probably tie

26:34.505 --> 26:37.770
-their hands
behind their backs, imbecile!
-[laughs]

26:37.813 --> 26:39.554
-[electrical buzzing]
-[groaning]

26:45.081 --> 26:46.430
Do you think he's right?

26:47.431 --> 26:49.477
Yes. You are an imbecile.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.133
[Ahmed] Come on, come on!
What do we have?

26:53.176 --> 26:54.438
I can't get anything.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.397
He encrypted and deleted it.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.139
And he shredded it, too.
There's no way to get it back.

27:00.096 --> 27:02.142
You're useless! All of you, out!

27:03.404 --> 27:06.276
Go! You, too! Get out!

27:08.627 --> 27:10.759
[door whirring]

27:15.024 --> 27:16.504
Meet me in the warehouse.

27:16.547 --> 27:18.201
[man] Sir, Brandt's on campus.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.160
Bring him.

27:22.075 --> 27:25.295
Brandt. We have a problem.

27:25.339 --> 27:27.384
Ram is under contract with us.

27:27.428 --> 27:29.735
Anything he crates
is our property.

27:29.778 --> 27:32.433
He was successful,
but he destroyed the code

27:32.476 --> 27:35.566
and erased the data. He won't
divulge any information.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.438
It is my intellectual property.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.745
If he can sell it,
he can sell it for billions.

27:39.788 --> 27:42.138
-We have to stop him.
-Tell me what you want me to do.

27:42.182 --> 27:43.531
I need him to talk.

27:44.271 --> 27:45.751
You have the means, right?

27:46.403 --> 27:47.883
I...

27:50.233 --> 27:52.105
I'll get you what you need.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.285
He's not answering.
He's not here.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.940
-Something is very wrong.
-Don't worry.

28:00.983 --> 28:03.420
He's probably doing
the mad scientist thing.

28:05.901 --> 28:06.902
We'll find him.

28:10.384 --> 28:13.517
Good news! Ram has made
an incredible discovery,

28:13.561 --> 28:16.825
and the U.S. military
has classified it as top secret.

28:16.869 --> 28:18.522
The bad news is none
of you have clearance,

28:18.566 --> 28:20.263
so you will no longer be able
to work with him.

28:21.047 --> 28:24.311
-Is it the matter transfer?
-As I said, it is top secret.

28:24.354 --> 28:26.530
Suffice it to say, you can
no longer work on this project

28:26.574 --> 28:29.098
-until we give you
that approval.
-What?

28:29.142 --> 28:32.101
-Are we going to get paid?
-Each of you
will receive your bonus.

28:32.145 --> 28:35.191
But let me be clear--
this is classified.

28:35.235 --> 28:39.021
You cannot contact anyone
outside of this institute
for any reason.

28:39.065 --> 28:41.241
You may not leave
until we give you permission.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.332
Right now, you need to turn in
your cellphones and all other
electronic devices.

28:45.375 --> 28:47.551
Wait. Where's Ram?

28:47.595 --> 28:50.511
Don't worry. Ram is working
with the U.S. military's finest.

28:50.554 --> 28:52.339
He's perfectly safe.

28:52.382 --> 28:53.644
[grunting]

28:57.387 --> 28:58.388
Tell me!

29:01.435 --> 29:04.438
-Progress report?
-He's got
some strong convictions,

29:05.134 --> 29:07.615
but I'll get your code.
It's just a matter of time.
He'll break.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.878
Let's see if we could
speed time up.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.707
[woman screaming indistinctly]

29:15.275 --> 29:18.626
I seem to recall you said
if someone killed your parents,

29:18.669 --> 29:20.802
you would go back
in time to save them.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.414
Any last words for your parents?

29:27.374 --> 29:30.333
-No.
-Just give me
what is rightfully mine

29:30.377 --> 29:32.509
and everyone walks away.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.555
If I tell you,
you'll still kill us.

29:35.948 --> 29:37.166
It's your choice.

29:38.211 --> 29:40.648
Go ahead and live
and die by your logic.

29:42.606 --> 29:44.217
[whispers]
I didn't sign up for this.

29:46.045 --> 29:49.613
You work for me.
In the hallway. Now.

30:01.582 --> 30:04.715
We aren't really going to kill
them. I'm just being persuasive.

30:04.759 --> 30:06.761
And even if I did,
we could use his time machine

30:06.805 --> 30:08.589
to bring them back.
That's the point.

30:08.632 --> 30:10.156
Time machine?

30:10.199 --> 30:11.897
He invented a time machine?

30:14.377 --> 30:16.597
Just give me
a little bit more time.

30:16.640 --> 30:19.339
I'll get you what you need.
No one has to get hurt.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.297
You've been through
a tough time.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.734
You lost your family.

30:24.344 --> 30:25.606
I understand.

30:26.694 --> 30:29.001
Take your mind off things.
Go back to the office.

30:29.044 --> 30:30.132
We'll handle this.

30:35.790 --> 30:36.704
[sighs]

30:46.757 --> 30:48.934
I'm going to kill
your father in seven seconds

30:48.977 --> 30:50.805
if you don't give me the code.

30:52.938 --> 30:57.725
-Six...five...four...
-[father] Anything. Anything.

30:57.768 --> 30:59.161
-Three...
-Please.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.859
-No!
-Two...

31:00.902 --> 31:02.948
-No!
-One! Shoot the father.

31:02.991 --> 31:04.427
-[gunshot]
-[cries] No!

31:04.471 --> 31:07.778
-[screams]
-Ready to talk?

31:07.822 --> 31:11.086
-Or do I kill your mother?
-[gasps]

31:11.826 --> 31:13.349
[cries]

31:13.393 --> 31:18.354
Look at me.
Ram, don't worry.

31:18.398 --> 31:21.401
He'll only be dead
in this time continuum.

31:23.794 --> 31:26.754
Five seconds.
Four... three...

31:26.797 --> 31:29.539
-two... Look at them.
-No! [cries]

31:29.583 --> 31:31.541
-One.
-Shoot the mother!

31:31.585 --> 31:33.587
-[gunshot]
-[screams] No! [cries]

31:37.808 --> 31:40.594
I know your pain.
I've been there.

31:40.637 --> 31:42.726
But you can change it
all back.

31:44.641 --> 31:49.429
Watching your parents
die was a piece of cake
compared to what's next.

31:51.822 --> 31:55.478
Sabeer, keep him comfortable
until I return.

32:06.620 --> 32:08.187
[slow music]

32:16.630 --> 32:17.936
This is not my fault.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.592
I am not the bad guy here.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.252
This is because of you, God.

32:33.038 --> 32:35.475
You made me this way.
You put me in this position.

32:38.391 --> 32:42.264
If you want me
to believe in you,

32:42.308 --> 32:45.920
I need proof.
I need something, anything.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.271
How can I trust in you
if you won't even show up?

32:57.192 --> 33:00.891
Anything that happens
from this moment on,

33:02.458 --> 33:03.720
that's on you.

33:06.071 --> 33:10.510
It has come to my attention
to you have developed a bit of
an attraction for your coworker.

33:12.816 --> 33:16.951
-You know I won't talk.
-[chuckles] You're mistaken.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.519
I learned the slow art
of torture.

33:19.562 --> 33:21.260
How long will you hold out

33:21.303 --> 33:24.263
watching your Amy
tortured every day,

33:24.306 --> 33:26.134
knowing you are the cause?

33:26.874 --> 33:28.006
Let's see.

33:29.355 --> 33:33.968
You have five seconds.
Four... three... two...

33:34.012 --> 33:38.494
Wait! I don't know
if I can control time.

33:38.538 --> 33:41.019
I have no way of knowing
if I can send humans through it.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.151
If you can't send
humans back in time,

33:43.195 --> 33:44.979
you can never save your parents.

33:45.023 --> 33:49.027
-Three... two...
-Stop! Just stop!

33:50.550 --> 33:53.205
If you let me go back in time
and save my parents,

33:53.248 --> 33:54.684
then I will finish
the time machine.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.557
Just no more violence.

33:57.600 --> 34:00.081
Of course you can
save your parents.

34:00.125 --> 34:02.692
It'll take time.
Different molecular structures

34:02.736 --> 34:06.044
will need to be calibrated.
Transferring a human
is gonna be complex.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.654
You have three days.

34:16.097 --> 34:17.793
[door whirring]

34:20.014 --> 34:25.280
Try anything even remotely
suspicious or attempt to let
anyone know what is happening,

34:25.324 --> 34:26.934
-and Amy--
-I got it.

34:29.023 --> 34:31.547
This is his home
for the next three days.

34:31.591 --> 34:33.505
Don't ever leave him alone.

34:33.549 --> 34:35.812
Keep the cameras on him
full-time.

34:35.856 --> 34:39.512
I want two people watching
him twenty-four seven. Got it?

34:39.554 --> 34:40.817
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

34:43.297 --> 34:44.516
Three days.

34:45.387 --> 34:48.608
No stalling, and no games.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.177
[Ahmed] Fire it up.

34:54.222 --> 34:58.574
[breathes heavily]
It's only partially functional.

34:58.618 --> 35:01.925
There are still incongruences,
and I haven't completed
all the safeguards.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.579
Fire it up!

35:05.886 --> 35:07.583
-[electric buzzing / static]
- Initiating transfer.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.980
Step up.

35:14.024 --> 35:16.984
But, sir, maybe the kid should
step up, because he made it,

35:17.027 --> 35:19.073
-and he might--
-Get on the time pad.

35:19.769 --> 35:21.162
[Ram] Hang on. He's gonna need
one of these.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.992
Einstein, initiate timestamp
on retriever.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.342
[computer]
Completed at eleven fifty P.M.

35:27.386 --> 35:29.605
-What's this?
-The retrievers are needed

35:29.649 --> 35:31.955
to travel into the past
or the future.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.175
Without one, you can transfer,

35:34.219 --> 35:36.134
but your molecules
will explode within seconds.

35:36.699 --> 35:39.093
It also tracks
your vitals. So,

35:39.137 --> 35:41.051
if you were to perish,
it would reclaim his body.

35:41.095 --> 35:42.966
Wait, w-what?
You want to say that again?

35:43.010 --> 35:44.577
Step into the field.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.721
[electric buzzing / static]

36:13.083 --> 36:15.085
How do you feel?

36:15.129 --> 36:17.262
-I didn't feel anything.
-Walk around.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.529
It's good.
Everything's good.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.185
Good job, everyone! We did it!

36:29.709 --> 36:31.624
[computer]
Initiating transfer.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.713
[electric buzzing / static]

36:36.019 --> 36:37.369
Oh, Ram.

36:39.153 --> 36:41.416
You're so predictable.
I'll take that.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.244
Just at least let me finish it.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.115
So you can try
and sneak back in time again?

36:45.159 --> 36:47.683
-I don't think so.
-What about my parents?

36:47.727 --> 36:51.731
Seriously, Ram?
You thought that I would keep
my word for a split second?

36:51.774 --> 36:55.082
You're dumber than you look.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.476
-[taser static]
-[grunting]

36:59.304 --> 37:00.348
Take him to confinement.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.922
[door beeping / whirring]

37:09.705 --> 37:12.099
You're still mad at God
for your wife and family, right?

37:14.928 --> 37:18.410
-Yeah.
-I have the perfect mission
for you.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.630
You're mad at Jesus,
but wouldn't it be great to know

37:21.674 --> 37:24.503
if he was the real deal
or just a myth?

37:24.546 --> 37:26.287
And how would
you prove that?

37:26.331 --> 37:28.768
Prepare a full combat team

37:28.811 --> 37:30.987
and let me enlighten you.

37:35.514 --> 37:36.428
Take a break.

37:37.080 --> 37:38.473
You two stay here.

37:41.781 --> 37:45.654
We can't kill him.
Jesus is a prophet.
We should honor him!

37:45.698 --> 37:48.570
Yes, and that's what
we will be doing.

37:48.614 --> 37:51.573
When he died, his disciples
created the resurrection myth

37:51.617 --> 37:54.272
which gave birth
to Christianity.
We can correct that.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.796
But if we kill him,
we'll all be cursed!

37:56.839 --> 37:59.842
Just the opposite.
Allah would honor us.

37:59.886 --> 38:02.671
We will be correcting
the greatest deception
of all time.

38:02.715 --> 38:05.370
He will be remembered
as a great prophet

38:05.413 --> 38:08.982
but not as a son of God.
Jesus would want that.

38:09.025 --> 38:12.290
And we will be effectively
dismantling Christianity.

38:13.073 --> 38:15.205
If we get caught,
we are gonna get so fired.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.729
That's the least
of our concerns.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.078
We have to find him.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.340
Release the other cameras.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.168
Keep this room looping.

38:21.211 --> 38:23.910
-[Felix] Presto.
-Search for Ram.

38:25.346 --> 38:27.043
I don't see him anywhere.

38:27.087 --> 38:28.218
Try our lab.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.833
Guys, what are Ahmed
and those combat guys doing?

38:33.876 --> 38:36.966
They're using Einstein,
but for what?

38:37.010 --> 38:39.360
If Ram created
matter transfer,

38:39.404 --> 38:42.189
they can go anywhere
GPS coordinates can take them.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.497
They did it! They're gone!

38:45.540 --> 38:47.542
[laughs] Oh! What?

38:47.586 --> 38:49.762
-We gonna get some money!
-It doesn't matter.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.329
Focus on finding Ram.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.421
-Bingo!
-Where is he?

38:56.464 --> 38:57.944
Uh, that's
the south warehouse.

38:57.987 --> 39:00.686
Checking for guards. None.

39:00.729 --> 39:02.427
Can you clear a path
to get us there?

39:02.470 --> 39:04.951
No problem. Okay...

39:12.437 --> 39:14.352
-Are you okay?
-We have a problem.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.919
Ahmed killed my parents,
and he was gonna torture

39:16.963 --> 39:18.921
and kill you guys, so I agreed
to build the time machine.

39:18.965 --> 39:21.576
-A time machine?
-Yeah, long story.

39:21.620 --> 39:25.232
They already did it.
They sent Brandt and a team
somewhere already.

39:26.059 --> 39:28.540
If they transfer back in time,
they'll altar history.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.890
We have to go.

39:36.852 --> 39:38.376
[speaks in Aramaic]

39:49.125 --> 39:52.085
[electrical static / beeping]

39:55.044 --> 39:56.829
-We're all good?
-Check.

39:56.872 --> 39:59.440
Find him. Tight perimeter.

39:59.484 --> 40:01.660
[suspenseful music]

40:07.274 --> 40:08.406
Got them.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.460
Over there.

40:28.730 --> 40:29.688
Target acquired.

40:29.731 --> 40:31.298
Rally on me.

40:31.341 --> 40:32.995
You two on Sabeer.

40:33.039 --> 40:34.432
Flank him. Go.

40:35.607 --> 40:37.086
You two, on me.

40:43.571 --> 40:44.703
Need to verify target.

40:49.751 --> 40:50.926
Target verified.

40:52.319 --> 40:57.237
Three... two... one. Engage.

40:59.239 --> 41:00.806
[gunfire]

41:11.991 --> 41:13.819
[groans]

41:18.911 --> 41:22.001
I've got him. Kill the rest.

41:26.135 --> 41:30.531
If you really are
the son of God,

41:30.575 --> 41:33.229
you can stop these bullets.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.580
-Unless I allow it.
-No.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.931
You are not giving me
your life.

41:38.974 --> 41:40.976
I am taking it from you!

41:41.020 --> 41:44.197
-I have already died for you.
-Lies.

41:44.240 --> 41:48.462
-Do what you must do.
-Just more lies.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.291
[breathes heavily]

41:53.162 --> 41:55.164
This is for taking my family.

41:57.558 --> 41:58.820
[gunfire]

42:05.174 --> 42:06.045
Bag him.

42:12.442 --> 42:14.227
Leave the arm with the time
retriever hanging out.

42:18.623 --> 42:19.972
Did he just speak English?

42:21.843 --> 42:24.542
In thirty-three A.D.?
Don't be a moron.

42:28.241 --> 42:31.810
You smart off to me
like that again, you will be
picking up your teeth.

42:37.380 --> 42:40.470
We've done what we came to do.
Let's go.

42:46.476 --> 42:47.608
Transfer now.

42:48.435 --> 42:51.612
[beeping / electrical static]

43:02.667 --> 43:06.148
[sniffs]
I wanted you to stop me.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.805
Now you know...

43:12.415 --> 43:13.721
what I feel.

43:19.205 --> 43:20.467
[retriever beeping]

43:21.686 --> 43:23.688
[whirring / electrical static]

43:32.435 --> 43:35.134
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!
Look. They came back.

43:36.178 --> 43:38.790
-They're wearing my retrievers.
-Retrievers?

43:38.833 --> 43:40.705
Without the retrievers,
they can transfer,

43:40.748 --> 43:42.228
but their molecules
will explode.

43:43.185 --> 43:44.622
Is that a body?

43:45.579 --> 43:47.320
[Simon]
Uh, it sure looks like one.

43:49.583 --> 43:52.151
This could be our chance.
I'll go back in time,

43:52.194 --> 43:54.806
expose Ahmed, make sure
time travel never happens.

43:54.849 --> 43:57.504
Felix, can you clear
a path to Lab One
and loop all the cameras?

43:57.547 --> 44:00.768
I can't believe
you guys keep asking
such obvious questions.

44:01.769 --> 44:03.423
[door whirring]

44:03.466 --> 44:05.425
[action music]

44:07.688 --> 44:09.603
Felix, disable the door.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.127
Ahmed changed time.
Depending on the circumstances,

44:12.171 --> 44:14.521
-we might not exist
in a few minutes.
-Say what?

44:14.564 --> 44:17.350
No. If whatever he did
affected us, wouldn't we
have changed already?

44:17.393 --> 44:20.353
Time doesn't change
instantaneously.
It has to rewrite itself.

44:20.396 --> 44:23.399
-Rewrite itself?
-It's like the speed of light.
It appears to move instantly,

44:23.443 --> 44:26.707
-but has a speed.
-So that's why everything
was blowing up on the time pad.

44:26.751 --> 44:29.449
Exactly. We were inadvertently
splitting the time continuum.

44:29.492 --> 44:31.581
So time has to catch up
with itself?

44:31.625 --> 44:33.975
Exactly, like overwriting data
in a hard drive.

44:34.019 --> 44:36.761
The old time continuum
is written over
as the new data is received.

44:36.804 --> 44:38.893
That could take minutes,
hours, possibly longer,

44:38.937 --> 44:40.895
depending on how far back
in time they went.

44:40.939 --> 44:44.725
-Got it. Doors are secure.
-You're telling me it's possible

44:44.769 --> 44:47.119
it already happened and we're
already in a new time continuum?

44:47.162 --> 44:48.990
Sure, if they changed
something minor,

44:49.034 --> 44:50.775
but if Ahmed killed
someone important,

44:50.818 --> 44:52.690
we might cease to exist.

44:54.256 --> 44:56.041
Access denied.

44:56.084 --> 44:58.434

Einstein,
initiate retrievers!

45:00.436 --> 45:02.743
Initialized time code
one fifty A.M.

45:02.787 --> 45:03.831
Quick, come put these on.

45:06.442 --> 45:08.618
Override door locks in Lab One.

45:09.315 --> 45:11.143
-[computer] Coordinates denied.
-What?

45:11.752 --> 45:14.755
-Access denied.
-They went
really far back in time.

45:14.799 --> 45:16.844
We're gonna have to go
back further.

45:16.888 --> 45:18.716
-[clattering]
-Hurry, they're overriding me.

45:18.759 --> 45:20.718
Einstein, program
last known coordinates!

45:20.761 --> 45:22.589
Initiating transfer.

45:22.632 --> 45:24.983
[electrical buzzing / static]

45:30.423 --> 45:31.337
[gunfire]

45:37.082 --> 45:38.866
[breathes heavily]

45:38.910 --> 45:40.694
-Sorry.
-Thanks.

45:40.738 --> 45:42.696
[breathes heavily]

45:44.524 --> 45:48.223
-I don't know about you guys,
I'm going this way.
-Yeah.

45:51.836 --> 45:56.536
Hold up. Hold on.
Yo, what we running for?

45:57.232 --> 45:58.668
What was that light?

45:58.712 --> 46:00.409
Must have been Ahmed's guys.

46:00.453 --> 46:02.237
This is the same time
they materialized.

46:03.369 --> 46:06.154
Are we safe from the time
continuum override thing?

46:06.198 --> 46:11.072
Uh... we transferred
from continuum A,

46:11.116 --> 46:13.814
and it materialized
in continuum B, which is
a part of continuum A,

46:13.858 --> 46:17.122
but by being here,
in theory, we're creating
a new continuum C.

46:17.165 --> 46:19.124
Time can't loop itself.
We should be fine.

46:19.167 --> 46:22.431
Whoa, whoa. Slow that down
and say that again.

46:22.475 --> 46:25.478
If B overrides A, then
there won't be a time continuum

46:25.521 --> 46:26.784
for us to return to.

46:26.827 --> 46:28.046
Nothing to go back to?

46:28.089 --> 46:30.439
We're just stuck here?

46:30.483 --> 46:31.745
I don't know yet.

46:32.615 --> 46:33.616
Shh!

46:33.660 --> 46:35.140
[chanting]

46:35.183 --> 46:36.619
[foreign yelling]

46:41.973 --> 46:43.017
It's Jesus!

46:51.199 --> 46:53.462
[gunfire]

47:00.730 --> 47:01.688
[Ram] Stop running!

47:03.516 --> 47:07.215
I get it.
It's the ultimate jihad.

47:07.259 --> 47:10.697
Eliminate Christianity
by killing Jesus
before the resurrection.

47:10.740 --> 47:13.613
Ahmed just killed off every
Christian that ever existed.

47:13.656 --> 47:15.876
Why would Muslims do that?
It makes no sense.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.183
They wouldn't,
but Ahmed's part
of an extremist group.

47:18.226 --> 47:20.620
This can't be happening.
Jesus is God.

47:20.663 --> 47:23.362
-He can't be killed by men.
-That's not factually correct.

47:23.405 --> 47:25.146
He was actually killed by men.

47:25.190 --> 47:27.670
He wouldn't allow it
to happen this way.

47:27.714 --> 47:30.760
Okay, let's look at this
from your perspective.

47:30.804 --> 47:33.894
If Jesus is God, then He would
only allow this to happen

47:33.938 --> 47:36.897
if He had another purpose,
right? If He can control time,

47:36.941 --> 47:39.334
then He can inherently create
several time continuums--

47:39.378 --> 47:42.120
Guys!
Can we talk theology later?

47:42.163 --> 47:44.426
We need to get home
before time changes.

47:44.470 --> 47:46.776
Okay. If continuum B
has overwritten continuum A,

47:46.820 --> 47:48.604
there's nothing for us
to go back to.

47:48.648 --> 47:51.172
Our genes will be
splattered across the universe.

47:51.216 --> 47:54.175
However, it's safe to assume
that two thousand years

47:54.219 --> 47:56.874
is an enormous amount
of data to overwrite itself.

47:56.917 --> 48:00.051
That could take
anywhere from a year to...

48:00.965 --> 48:03.358
-maybe ten minutes.
-Ten minutes?

48:03.402 --> 48:04.925
What are we waiting for, man?
Let's go!

48:04.969 --> 48:06.231
Our chances of success improve

48:06.274 --> 48:07.362
if we split into groups.

48:07.406 --> 48:08.886
Amy and I will go first,

48:08.929 --> 48:10.191
then you two follow.

48:10.235 --> 48:11.932
They might be waiting for us.

48:11.976 --> 48:14.282
If we're killed,
it'll be up to you two.

48:15.457 --> 48:19.331
Let's say you guys
do get killed, right?
How do we fix this?

48:19.374 --> 48:22.595
There's a default code
I programmed while pretending
to be asleep.

48:22.638 --> 48:25.728
Say to Einstein,
"Mom and Dad default."

48:25.772 --> 48:27.556
It takes you back
to the warehouse

48:27.600 --> 48:29.428
about ten minutes
before they killed my parents.

48:29.471 --> 48:32.692
You'll have to stop them
and free me.

48:32.735 --> 48:36.348
[exhales loudly]
Oh, man. This is...

48:38.002 --> 48:39.177
All right, man.

48:41.048 --> 48:42.920
Let's do this.

48:43.659 --> 48:45.096
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

48:45.705 --> 48:47.707
-Hold down both simultaneously.
-Ready.

48:47.750 --> 48:50.362
Three... two... one.

48:51.145 --> 48:53.408
[beeping / electrical static]

48:58.457 --> 49:00.807
[beeping / whirring]

49:16.954 --> 49:20.087
Hurry! Mine's not working.
Try yours.

49:20.131 --> 49:21.088
[beeping]

49:22.350 --> 49:24.787
-What are we gonna do?
-I don't know yet.

49:24.831 --> 49:27.312
Let's hope we're a good enough
distraction for Simon and Felix.

49:27.355 --> 49:29.792
-[alarm blaring]
-This might still be
operational.

49:29.836 --> 49:31.577
If I can reprogram this machine,

49:31.620 --> 49:33.361
I might be able to transfer us
out of here.

49:35.755 --> 49:37.931
-What happened here?
-We were prepping the machine

49:37.975 --> 49:39.889
and Ram and Amy just appeared
on the transfer pad.

49:39.933 --> 49:41.804
-What?
-That's impossible.

49:41.848 --> 49:43.632
I locked them
in the cell myself.

49:44.198 --> 49:45.547
Take the team,
track them down.

49:46.592 --> 49:49.247
Lock it down.
Nobody comes or goes.

49:49.290 --> 49:52.380
Lock down. Lock down.
Apprehend Ram Goldstein
and Amy Lee.

49:54.165 --> 49:55.296
Say again.

49:57.690 --> 49:59.866
They've found them.
They've barricaded themselves
in Lab Nineteen.

50:01.041 --> 50:02.260
Get out of my way!

50:03.870 --> 50:05.045
[gunfire]

50:06.655 --> 50:09.441
[grunts] Get the saw!

50:11.356 --> 50:14.707
This is inaccurate. We must be
in an alternate time continuum,
but how?

50:14.750 --> 50:17.275
What time did Einstein program
our retrievers?

50:17.318 --> 50:20.191
-It was one fifty A.M.
-No, it's one twenty A.M. now.

50:20.234 --> 50:23.063
We came back before we left? If
we were gone for thirty minutes,

50:23.107 --> 50:24.934
we should've roughly returned
around two twenty A.M.

50:24.978 --> 50:27.850
Wait, daylight savings time.
It started tonight!

50:27.894 --> 50:30.331
Einstein's clock
resets at two twenty.
It must have overcompensated

50:30.375 --> 50:31.637
and sent us back
an hour early.

50:34.553 --> 50:35.815
[electric saw buzzing]

50:38.470 --> 50:41.125
Give me your time retriever!
These won't work anymore.

50:41.168 --> 50:42.604
I need to sync them with...

50:44.432 --> 50:45.346
this phone.

50:46.913 --> 50:50.569
One twenty. I was... [exhales]

50:52.701 --> 50:55.139
-What are you doing?
-You're not
the only genius here.

51:00.796 --> 51:03.060
Uh, this is surreal.

51:03.103 --> 51:04.800
Amy, what are you signing?

51:05.627 --> 51:09.283
"Ahmed used
Ram's time machine

51:09.892 --> 51:13.200
to go back
in time and kill Jesus"?

51:13.244 --> 51:16.116
You must free Ram
from the south warehouse

51:16.160 --> 51:20.468
and stop them.
Ahmed does not know that
you exist. Hurry."

51:20.512 --> 51:22.253
[electric saw buzzing]

51:23.515 --> 51:25.473
Okay, I'm almost done.

51:25.517 --> 51:28.911
-Get on the time pad.
-[gunfire]

51:28.955 --> 51:29.825
[gasps]

51:31.349 --> 51:32.393
I'm dead.

51:33.481 --> 51:36.441
No, you just
warned yourself.

51:36.484 --> 51:38.399
We gotta free Ram
and change this.

51:38.443 --> 51:39.487
Targets are down.

51:41.968 --> 51:43.926
-Let's go.
-[alarm ringing]

51:47.321 --> 51:50.977
Got him! Let's go get him.
[breathes heavily]

51:51.020 --> 51:53.284
[beeping / whirring]

51:53.327 --> 51:55.764
Get out! Get up!
Get out, now!

51:55.808 --> 51:57.853
-Let's roll.
-Go.

51:57.897 --> 52:00.378
Get your- Get your cute
behind on out of here.

52:00.421 --> 52:02.031
You-- Get out.

52:03.337 --> 52:05.513
-[door whirring]
-[alarm ringing]

52:05.557 --> 52:07.167
This might take me
a few minutes.

52:07.211 --> 52:09.430
We don't have a few minutes.

52:09.474 --> 52:12.085
-I don't know if
I can pull him out!
-Setting destination

52:12.129 --> 52:14.000
ten minutes
prior to the last transfer.

52:14.043 --> 52:16.394
- Initiate transfer.
-Initiate Time Retrievers.

52:16.437 --> 52:18.961
-Confirmed. One forty A.M.
-Quick, put these on.

52:19.005 --> 52:21.660
-What are these?
-Uh, time retrievers.

52:21.703 --> 52:24.663
Just put one on
if you want to live.
And get into the time field.

52:29.494 --> 52:31.844
[Simon] Hey, we got to go.

52:32.497 --> 52:34.542
Ram and Amy been waiting for,
like, thirty minutes now.

52:34.586 --> 52:36.414
No, you go.
I'll stay here.

52:36.457 --> 52:38.851
[sighs] We talked about this.

52:38.894 --> 52:40.505
That's not an option.

52:41.114 --> 52:43.247
Everything's gonna be alright.
I got you.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.468
Besides, Happy needs you.

52:47.512 --> 52:49.905
-Yeah, Happy needs me.
-Yeah.

52:51.429 --> 52:52.995
What's this gonna do
against their guns?

52:53.866 --> 52:56.434
[sighs] Look,
I said I got you, okay?

52:56.477 --> 52:58.653
Now, come on, let's go.
On three.

52:58.697 --> 53:03.528
One, two, three.

53:03.571 --> 53:07.619
[electrical static / buzzing]

53:07.662 --> 53:10.883
Oh! Oh! Ah!

53:11.666 --> 53:15.192
Oh, no, no! No, no, no, no!

53:15.975 --> 53:18.891
[sighs and groans]

53:18.934 --> 53:20.849
[electrical static / buzzing]

53:29.249 --> 53:30.642
How did you get here?

53:31.991 --> 53:34.602
Scotty beamed me down
from the Enterprise.

53:34.646 --> 53:36.300
[groans]

53:37.692 --> 53:40.260
You two keep working.
Find out what happened.

53:40.304 --> 53:43.437
The rest of you
bring Felix with me.

53:47.485 --> 53:49.487
[beeping / door whirring]

53:51.053 --> 53:52.446
How did you get into my lab?

53:53.404 --> 53:55.406
You already know. Time travel.

53:56.407 --> 53:59.061
If you answer snarky again,
those will be your last words.

54:06.808 --> 54:09.289
-Oh, man. It's started.
-What is this?

54:09.333 --> 54:10.638
What started?

54:12.336 --> 54:14.294
Your men went back in time and
killed Jesus and his disciples.

54:14.338 --> 54:17.689
-Liar. We did not do this.
-Yes, you did.

54:17.732 --> 54:20.300
Now the timeline
is overriding itself.

54:20.344 --> 54:22.302
[electrical static]

54:22.346 --> 54:26.132
What? [chuckles]
Allahu Akbar.

54:26.175 --> 54:27.394
[laughs]

54:29.091 --> 54:33.792
Finally, a world without
filthy Christian scum.

54:36.185 --> 54:37.665
[birds chirping]

54:38.492 --> 54:40.668
[electrical static]

54:44.672 --> 54:46.935
[thunder rumbling]

54:49.721 --> 54:50.852
This is your world...

54:51.723 --> 54:53.420
This can't be right.

54:53.464 --> 54:55.553
...a world
that you created,

54:56.423 --> 54:58.686
a world without forgiveness.

54:59.513 --> 55:01.820
[electrical static]

55:20.055 --> 55:22.057
[breathing shakily]

55:28.629 --> 55:30.892
-It worked.
-Yeah, we're good.

55:30.936 --> 55:33.547
Yeah, it's a good thing, 'cause
we'd all be dead right now.

55:33.591 --> 55:36.420
I programmed us
to arrive ten minutes
before Ahmed and his guys.

55:36.463 --> 55:38.378
We'll have
the element of surprise.

55:38.422 --> 55:41.076
How is that supposed to help
us against their guns?

55:41.120 --> 55:45.733
Well, I have an idea,
but they'll only be vulnerable
while they're materializing.

55:45.777 --> 55:47.909
[Brandt] Everybody geared up,
strapped up. Lock and loaded.

55:47.953 --> 55:49.824
We don't know
what we're stepping into.

55:49.868 --> 55:53.132
Oh, yeah.
Time to get dirty.

55:54.046 --> 55:55.439

56:07.929 --> 56:09.670
[gunfire]

56:15.502 --> 56:16.895
No, no, no!

56:18.070 --> 56:21.116
-Did any of them get away?
-Uh, Brandt and Sabeer

56:21.160 --> 56:22.944
went off the cliff.
The rest are dead.

56:22.988 --> 56:26.818
Go after that, Ram.
Don't let them kill Jesus.

56:26.861 --> 56:29.386
-I can't leave you.
-[electrical static / buzzing]

56:30.387 --> 56:31.344
What?

56:32.476 --> 56:34.434
I added a safety protocol.

56:34.478 --> 56:36.654
If the retriever
detects no pulse--

56:36.697 --> 56:42.050
Ram. You have to make sure...
save Jesus.

56:42.094 --> 56:44.444
If Jesus is God, I think
he can take care of himself.

56:44.488 --> 56:45.837
Make sure!

56:48.970 --> 56:50.929
Okay. Okay.

56:55.063 --> 56:55.977
I see one of them.

57:00.417 --> 57:01.548
[dramatic music]

57:02.854 --> 57:03.855
I don't want to leave you.

57:04.464 --> 57:07.424
Please do this for me.

57:08.468 --> 57:10.252
-[cries]
-Okay.

57:11.210 --> 57:14.039
Okay. I have to stop
the bleeding.

57:16.607 --> 57:20.001
[breathes heavily]

57:31.143 --> 57:36.278
-This is gonna hurt.
-[wincing]

57:38.629 --> 57:42.328
[voice breaking] Okay, just,
um, just don't die, okay?

57:44.548 --> 57:45.897
[cries] I'll be right back.

58:00.781 --> 58:03.088
Brandt. Is that you?

58:32.204 --> 58:35.512
It would be me.
Everybody else gone,

58:35.555 --> 58:38.819
I'm stuck here for a day,
ain't got no-- no toilet paper,
no nothing, man.

58:41.474 --> 58:44.433
Ram, listen, if you can hear me,

58:44.477 --> 58:46.958
I'm still stuck down here, and
I would really like to go home,

58:47.001 --> 58:48.481
so can you please
beam me up?

58:50.309 --> 58:51.919
Ugh! [sighs]

58:54.008 --> 58:55.314
This damn country place.

59:01.668 --> 59:04.410
[device beeping]

59:05.629 --> 59:07.282
[electrical static / buzzing]

59:08.153 --> 59:13.158
Oh! Aah! No! [groaning]

59:13.201 --> 59:16.944
Whew! [exhaling sharply] Ah.

59:18.076 --> 59:18.990
[grunts]

59:21.645 --> 59:24.952
Uh, hey. Uh, are you okay?

59:24.996 --> 59:27.128
[speaks Aramaic]

59:27.172 --> 59:30.654
Uh... no speak-o Greek-o?

59:35.180 --> 59:36.616
Has my Father sent you?

59:36.660 --> 59:38.966
What? You speak English?

59:40.315 --> 59:42.883
Wh- [sighs] Are you Jesus?

59:45.233 --> 59:46.234
It is I.

59:50.804 --> 59:53.154
What is your purpose here?

59:54.155 --> 59:55.461
Purpose? Uh...

59:57.681 --> 59:59.726
I think I'm here to save you.

59:59.770 --> 01:00:02.816
Listen, if you go back
to your camp,

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:04.644
men will come and shoot you.

01:00:05.384 --> 01:00:09.170
You know what- shooting- shoot.
Sorry, Jesus.

01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:11.912
What you describe cannot be so.

01:00:11.956 --> 01:00:14.436
It's a lot better
than the other way.

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:19.180
Listen, a mob comes
and they take you.

01:00:19.224 --> 01:00:22.749
And then they beat you
and then they whip you

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:26.448
and then they nail spikes
through your hands and feet
and they hang you on a cross.

01:00:26.492 --> 01:00:27.667
It ain't pretty.

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:31.236
How do you know
all these things?

01:00:32.063 --> 01:00:34.587
Well, uh, I'm from the future.

01:00:35.893 --> 01:00:37.155
And I've seen your movie.

01:00:37.895 --> 01:00:39.113
We got it on bootleg.

01:00:40.767 --> 01:00:42.856
Forgive me, Lord. I'm sorry.

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:45.859
But, uh,
they mess you up pretty bad.

01:00:48.688 --> 01:00:50.298
And what of my disciples?

01:00:51.473 --> 01:00:55.434
Well, if they don't get
slaughtered by the assassins,

01:00:56.391 --> 01:00:59.568
then I think Peter
gets crucified upside down.

01:01:00.482 --> 01:01:05.662
[breathing shakily] Father,

01:01:06.314 --> 01:01:08.795
please, don't let this be.

01:01:10.710 --> 01:01:14.018
If it is already so,
you can still change things

01:01:14.061 --> 01:01:15.759
for the sake of one.

01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:20.328
You're the creator of all time.

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:23.331
You can
change whatever you desire.

01:01:24.768 --> 01:01:26.552
Please, grant me this.

01:01:28.075 --> 01:01:30.077
Allow Peter to live.

01:01:30.817 --> 01:01:34.168
Listen, don't get
bummed out, alright?

01:01:34.865 --> 01:01:37.519
I might be wrong
about the whole Peter thing.

01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:39.739
I kind of turned off your movie
when your flesh started

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:41.654
flying around
and sticking to stuff.

01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:45.310
What else do you know
of me in your future?

01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:48.052
The book that you wrote,
The Bible,

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:50.445
is the most read book
in history.

01:01:50.489 --> 01:01:53.144
I mean, you- you have
millions of believers.

01:01:56.234 --> 01:01:57.626
Praise you, Father.

01:01:59.933 --> 01:02:01.935
Thank you for sharing
this with me.

01:02:06.287 --> 01:02:07.898
Your words are encouraging.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.596
You have given me strength.

01:02:11.336 --> 01:02:14.426
-I got you.
-I must now lay down my life

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:16.689
-for the sins of this world.
-Hold on, what?

01:02:17.342 --> 01:02:19.083
That's not even close
to what I said, man.

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:21.868
I'm trying to help you escape.

01:02:22.477 --> 01:02:26.481
If there was another way,
I would welcome it.

01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:28.222
But there is not.

01:02:28.266 --> 01:02:30.659
[breathes deeply]

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.446
Oh. We're doing
some mind reading? Okay.

01:02:36.187 --> 01:02:39.756
Simon, if I do not give my life,

01:02:39.799 --> 01:02:43.368
you will die and never
be with me in heaven.

01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:50.897
Well, if that's the case,
go ahead. Do your thing.

01:02:50.941 --> 01:02:53.421
[chuckles]
It's your life. No, no, no,
no. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus-

01:02:53.465 --> 01:02:56.511
Hey, it's a joke, Jesus.
Don't do it.
I'm just joking with you.

01:02:56.555 --> 01:02:59.210
Thank you
for helping me tomorrow.

01:03:02.517 --> 01:03:05.999
Seriously,
man, don't do this to yourself.

01:03:07.827 --> 01:03:09.960
Look, giving away your life
is one thing,

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.614
but knowing that they
about to put the hurt on you?

01:03:13.311 --> 01:03:15.792
There's got to be another way
to save the world.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:18.098
There's just got to be, man.

01:03:18.142 --> 01:03:20.187
I know what
is going to happen to me,

01:03:21.275 --> 01:03:23.234
and if you had finished
my movie,

01:03:23.277 --> 01:03:26.672
you would know
that I'll be back.

01:03:30.067 --> 01:03:32.852
"I'll be back"?
That ain't even your movie!

01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:39.467
-[sighs]
-I warned you. I don't want
no part of this, man.

01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:41.818
[scoffs]

01:03:44.821 --> 01:03:46.997
Sabeer, I'm gonna find you,
you coward!

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.390
[people shouting]

01:03:49.434 --> 01:03:51.784
[screaming]

01:04:02.795 --> 01:04:05.493
A gun in this century.
[scoffs]

01:04:05.537 --> 01:04:07.365
Why are you making
this so hard?

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:28.429
[shouts in Aramaic]

01:04:31.302 --> 01:04:33.434
-[laughs]
-[shouts in Aramaic]

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:43.836
Peter? With Jesus?

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.925
-[speaks in Aramaic]
-Peter with Yeshua?

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:49.189
-[speaks in Aramaic]
-I saw you with that sword.

01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:51.235
You cut off the guy's ear.

01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:52.714
[speaks in Aramaic]

01:04:58.633 --> 01:04:59.591
[cries]

01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:06.250
It's gonna be okay.

01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:26.270
[cries]

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:30.796
Thank you.

01:05:36.062 --> 01:05:39.544
Stop. Don't go that way.
They'll kill you.

01:05:39.587 --> 01:05:42.286
-[speaks in Aramaic]
-Stop. They'll kill you!

01:05:46.594 --> 01:05:48.118
[Ahmed]
What happened to them?

01:05:48.161 --> 01:05:49.728
We don't know what happened.

01:05:51.164 --> 01:05:53.340
But they're all dead.

01:05:55.908 --> 01:06:00.782
Gunshot wounds to the kids,
sticks in our guys.

01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:02.175
This is strange.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:05.526
Brandt and Sabeer must have sent
the bodies back.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.180
Is it possible
to retrieve any of them here?

01:06:08.094 --> 01:06:12.142
No. But I think I can disable
Amy and Ram's time retrievers.

01:06:12.185 --> 01:06:13.665
That'll keep them
from returning.

01:06:13.708 --> 01:06:15.536
Do it. And clean up this mess.

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:21.673
[groans]

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:25.938
[breathes heavily]

01:06:25.982 --> 01:06:28.767
[groans]

01:06:47.481 --> 01:06:48.352
[gun clicks]

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:53.705
-Team report.
- It's Sabeer.

01:06:54.706 --> 01:06:57.535
- I thought you were a goner.
-[breathes heavily]

01:06:57.578 --> 01:06:59.276
I'm glad you were wrong.

01:07:01.234 --> 01:07:03.584
-And the team?
- All dead.

01:07:04.629 --> 01:07:07.327
I don't know how many
of the geniuses died.

01:07:07.371 --> 01:07:10.635
After we fell off the cliff,
Ram came after me.

01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:12.767
You mean after you pulled me
off the cliff?

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:21.124
-And Ram?
- He sort of got my weapon.

01:07:21.167 --> 01:07:22.995
Why does that not surprise me?

01:07:26.607 --> 01:07:29.349
-[moans softly]
Did you find Jesus?
-A- a bunch of soldiers

01:07:29.393 --> 01:07:31.308
came and took him. That's what
supposed to happen, right?

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:34.615
I'm gonna check
on your injuries, okay?

01:07:36.574 --> 01:07:38.097
[winces]

01:07:39.707 --> 01:07:42.058
We have to return
and get you to a hospital.

01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:44.103
They'll kill us
as soon we materialize.

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:49.021
Perhaps, but if we stay here,
you won't have a chance.

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.154
I'm not gonna let
your risk your life--

01:07:51.197 --> 01:07:52.546
I'd rather die trying
to save you

01:07:52.590 --> 01:07:53.808
than live knowing that I didn't.

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:58.465
-We have to try.
-No, Ram! No. [grunts]

01:07:58.509 --> 01:08:00.337
Three, two, one.

01:08:01.816 --> 01:08:03.209
-[retriever beeping]
-What?

01:08:04.602 --> 01:08:07.866
No, no, no, no. Oh, they must
have deactivated them.

01:08:08.475 --> 01:08:10.216
What does that mean?

01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:15.569
We're stranded here
with no way to get back.

01:08:21.532 --> 01:08:23.751
-Let's just go.
-No.

01:08:24.752 --> 01:08:26.450
Finish what we came here to do.

01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:31.585
Why aren't you taking your gun?

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:34.457
No guns. It's recon only.

01:08:38.201 --> 01:08:39.462
Cover that up.

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:47.426
Hurry up, already.

-[speaks in Aramaic]

01:09:25.335 --> 01:09:29.555

01:10:44.544 --> 01:10:45.415
Why...

01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:48.766
are you putting
yourself through this?

01:10:49.593 --> 01:10:51.464
Just stay down, okay?

01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:56.034
[breathes heavily] I- I can't.
I have to finish it.

01:10:56.077 --> 01:10:59.690
I must finish. [cries]

Hey! Stop hitting him!

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.089
[groaning] Help me up.

01:11:08.133 --> 01:11:09.395
-Come on, man.
-Please.

01:11:09.439 --> 01:11:11.832
[voice breaking] Come on, man.

01:11:17.925 --> 01:11:19.449
I got you, alright?

01:11:22.974 --> 01:11:23.931
I got you.

-Doctor? Healer?
-[speaks in Aramaic]

[speaks in Aramaic]

01:12:35.916 --> 01:12:38.397
No, I said I need a doctor!

01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:42.009
Amy? Amy?

01:12:46.710 --> 01:12:50.104
Well, if you're
who you say you are,

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:51.845
then please heal her.

01:12:55.588 --> 01:12:57.373
She risked her life for you.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.855
Do you even understand
what I'm saying?

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:05.598
[man] You're wasting your time.

01:13:07.295 --> 01:13:08.601
Sabeer.

01:13:11.822 --> 01:13:14.390
He can't even save himself.

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:28.578
We deserve this fate.
[breathes heavily]

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:35.019
He's done nothing wrong. [gasps]

01:13:36.673 --> 01:13:40.633
He's dying just like us.

01:13:41.895 --> 01:13:43.810
He's nothing but a criminal.

01:13:45.508 --> 01:13:48.162
Jesus... [breathing heavily]

01:13:52.863 --> 01:13:54.038
please forgive me.

01:13:55.735 --> 01:13:57.476
[breathing heavily]

01:14:01.132 --> 01:14:02.263
Remember me...

01:14:06.354 --> 01:14:09.488
when you enter your kingdom.
[breathing heavily]

01:14:13.274 --> 01:14:14.406
[groaning]

01:14:18.845 --> 01:14:22.109
You will be
with me in paradise.

01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:29.073
He tried to kill you...
and me!

01:14:29.116 --> 01:14:30.596
[cries] He shot Amy!

01:14:32.293 --> 01:14:34.861
If you're God, wouldn't
you know that?

01:14:34.905 --> 01:14:37.211
And now you're forgiving him?

01:14:37.255 --> 01:14:39.518
Your forgiveness means nothing!

01:14:40.345 --> 01:14:42.608
Prove that you're God!

01:14:42.652 --> 01:14:45.524
Come down off
that cross and heal Amy!

01:14:47.178 --> 01:14:49.702
You're supposed to be a genius,

01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:54.054
-and you're asking him for help.
-Shut up, Sabeer!

01:14:55.447 --> 01:15:00.147
[sobbing] Please!
Please save her!

01:15:01.409 --> 01:15:02.976
Please!

01:15:08.721 --> 01:15:10.201
You're nothing but a fraud.

01:15:11.898 --> 01:15:13.900
And now she's gonna die
because of you.

01:15:28.654 --> 01:15:31.527
[groaning] To save Amy,

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.443
you must forgive Brandt.

01:15:37.228 --> 01:15:38.577
I'll never forgive him...

01:15:40.231 --> 01:15:41.232
or you.

01:16:03.863 --> 01:16:06.779
-Ram? Ram!
-Simon?

01:16:06.823 --> 01:16:08.302
Man, where have you been?

01:16:09.826 --> 01:16:10.783
What happened to Amy?

01:16:12.002 --> 01:16:13.438
-They killed you. How--
-Hold on. What?

01:16:13.481 --> 01:16:16.659
Back it up. I'm still alive,
man. Nobody killed me.

01:16:16.702 --> 01:16:19.575
-I've been stuck here.
-Stuck here? You came with me.

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:23.579
Wait, were you with
the first me, the other me?

01:16:24.188 --> 01:16:25.581
First me?
What are you talking about?

01:16:26.277 --> 01:16:28.105
The original me
returned from the past,

01:16:28.148 --> 01:16:30.150
and then I sent us
back here to save Jesus,

01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:33.153
and we did, but now we're
stuck here. Why are you here?

01:16:33.893 --> 01:16:37.549
You gave me the cereal box
version, and it blew up on me,
like, three times, man.

01:16:40.204 --> 01:16:41.379
[Ram] Solar eclipse.

01:16:42.902 --> 01:16:45.339
Man, all this historical stuff
is incredibly accurate.

01:16:45.383 --> 01:16:48.255
-It doesn't prove that He's God.
-Hey, yo, hold up.

01:16:48.299 --> 01:16:49.561
I was with Him, alright?

01:16:50.257 --> 01:16:53.043
Now just because Jesus
may not be God

01:16:53.086 --> 01:16:54.784
doesn't mean
he doesn't think he is.

01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:58.091
God or man he's worthless
if He doesn't care

01:16:58.135 --> 01:17:00.833
-about the ones who love him.
-Listen, man, I'm telling you

01:17:00.877 --> 01:17:03.357
there's something
special about this dude.

01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:06.230
He even knows English. English!

01:17:06.273 --> 01:17:07.753
It hasn't even
been created yet!

01:17:07.797 --> 01:17:08.972
It doesn't matter!

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.627
Ahmed
deactivated our retrievers.

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:15.065
We need to find the ones that
Brandt and Sabeer were using

01:17:15.108 --> 01:17:16.632
or we'll never get home.

01:17:22.072 --> 01:17:24.378
-How did this get here?
-[woman] I don't know.

01:17:24.422 --> 01:17:26.598
It just materialized
on the transfer pad.

01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:28.774
It's Brandt's or Sabeer's.

01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:33.518
Re-program the machine
and send another team back.

01:17:33.561 --> 01:17:35.999
-Find Ram and kill him.
-I can't.

01:17:36.042 --> 01:17:37.653
All the retrievers are fried.

01:17:37.696 --> 01:17:39.567
This is our only one.

01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:43.136
Then I will go.

01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:46.444
His body will be in the tomb.
When they come to steal it,

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:48.707
-I'll kill them all.
-You should let me go.

01:17:48.751 --> 01:17:51.710
No. This is an honor I want.

01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:54.670
Jesus might have been a prophet,
but he isn't God.

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:56.062
I can prove it.

01:17:58.064 --> 01:18:00.676
[electrical static / buzzing]

01:18:02.765 --> 01:18:04.680
[suspenseful music]

01:18:26.005 --> 01:18:27.659
Dead as dead can be.

01:18:29.705 --> 01:18:31.619
Now I'll wait
for your friends to show up.

01:18:35.145 --> 01:18:36.973
They'll be nobody
to remember you.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:47.723
Simon? Simon?

01:18:49.594 --> 01:18:50.464
[Simon] What?

01:18:51.770 --> 01:18:54.251
How could he forgive Brandt
and not save Amy?

01:18:54.294 --> 01:18:56.993
And then tell me that
I have to forgive Brandt, too?

01:18:57.820 --> 01:18:59.822
-Who are you are talking about?
-Jesus.

01:18:59.865 --> 01:19:01.345
That's what he told me.

01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:04.130
He talked to you?

01:19:06.437 --> 01:19:09.005
You were gonna leave me hanging
as if I was the only fool
that heard him speaking English?

01:19:09.048 --> 01:19:12.573
Assuming just for a second
that He could be God,

01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:14.924
why would He allow
all this to happen?

01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:18.188
It's perplexing.
Perhaps Brandt--

01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:20.756
-Brandt is dead.
-That's what I'm saying.

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:22.801
And I still can't forgive him.

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:25.369
Well, maybe you should just
do what the man says and just...

01:19:26.022 --> 01:19:28.415
-let it go.
-I'm trying.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:33.507
I say I forgive him,
but it's not real.

01:19:35.814 --> 01:19:37.816
[moans softly]

01:19:39.470 --> 01:19:40.950
I'm here.

01:19:42.690 --> 01:19:44.867
How long have I been asleep?

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:47.434
A long time.

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:52.396
Simon?
You're not dead.

01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:57.575
Apparently the other timeline
didn't have much love for me.

01:19:57.618 --> 01:20:00.273
Are you hurt?

01:20:01.753 --> 01:20:06.236
Uh, nah. This is-
This is actually Jesus' blood.

01:20:07.411 --> 01:20:08.804
What happened?

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:13.330
-Can you take me to Him?
-It's too late.

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.942
-He died on a cross.
-When?

01:20:17.987 --> 01:20:19.597
The day before yesterday.

01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:23.906
Can you take me to his tomb?

01:20:24.907 --> 01:20:27.213
I want to see the resurrection.

01:20:27.257 --> 01:20:29.825
-Resurrection?
-Please.

01:20:32.305 --> 01:20:33.263
Help me get her up.

01:20:36.962 --> 01:20:38.398
[cloth ripping]

01:20:39.965 --> 01:20:41.619
No need for concern.

01:20:43.012 --> 01:20:46.015
Just getting a little DNA
for my lab.

01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:50.019
[grunts]

01:20:53.022 --> 01:20:55.328
Hey, that's got to be it.

01:20:57.504 --> 01:20:59.593
Amy, wake up.

01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:01.378
Hey. We're here.

01:21:03.946 --> 01:21:05.599
That's it.

01:21:05.643 --> 01:21:07.775
[rumbling]

01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:15.305
Hey, uh, you feeling this?

01:21:15.348 --> 01:21:17.046
It's happening.

01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:33.671
[beeping / electric static]

01:21:33.714 --> 01:21:34.890
[explosion]

01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:37.196
[gasps]

01:21:40.199 --> 01:21:41.722
He has risen.

01:21:42.985 --> 01:21:45.422
It looked kind of like
a time transfer. I wonder if--

01:21:45.465 --> 01:21:48.773
He's alive.
Go check it out.

01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:53.082
Yeah. Come on.

01:22:03.831 --> 01:22:05.398
Ahmed's men must have
stolen the body.

01:22:06.617 --> 01:22:09.881
Man, you are in denial.
Why would Ahmed come in here,

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:12.666
steal the body, and then
neatly fold up the linens?

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:15.104
Someone from the future
was here. There are
glow sticks everywhere.

01:22:16.279 --> 01:22:18.759
-We have to clean these up.
-Why, it's gonna mess up

01:22:18.803 --> 01:22:21.240
-the time continuum and junk?
-Yes, exactly.

01:22:30.162 --> 01:22:35.515
No. Oh. [cries]

01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:42.696
It's okay, Amy.
It doesn't hurt anymore.

01:22:44.263 --> 01:22:45.482
Thank you.

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:48.964
Why?

01:22:50.617 --> 01:22:52.445
I don't understand.

01:22:53.098 --> 01:22:55.971
Suppose a man
has one hundred sheep

01:22:57.102 --> 01:22:58.886
and one strays away.

01:23:01.063 --> 01:23:04.762
Will he not leave the others
for a time to find the one?

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:09.027
And when he finds the one

01:23:09.941 --> 01:23:11.899
and returns him safely home,

01:23:13.336 --> 01:23:15.164
will he not celebrate?

01:23:16.948 --> 01:23:19.516
You allowed all this

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:22.475
for the sake of one.

01:23:38.187 --> 01:23:40.711
[speaks in Aramaic]

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:45.237
Uh, be careful.
We might be changing history.

01:23:46.369 --> 01:23:48.501
Gone. Not here.

01:23:50.112 --> 01:23:51.287
He has risen.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:57.728
-[speaks in Aramaic]
-[Ram] Yes.

01:23:57.771 --> 01:24:00.252
-[speaks in Aramaic]
-[laughs]

01:24:05.866 --> 01:24:08.347
Amy. Hey.

01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:13.265
Amy?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.488
[sobbing]

01:24:36.201 --> 01:24:38.116
[speaks in Aramaic]

01:24:40.336 --> 01:24:41.859
Oh. Ram! Ram!

01:24:44.514 --> 01:24:45.558
Muchas gracias.

01:24:50.346 --> 01:24:51.651
Thank you.

01:24:55.568 --> 01:24:56.787
I can save her.

01:25:00.573 --> 01:25:02.358
What are the odds
of that happening?

01:25:04.011 --> 01:25:05.491
About a billion to one.

01:25:06.449 --> 01:25:08.973
How did she end up
with a time retriever?

01:25:09.016 --> 01:25:11.236
It must have been
Sabeer's or Brandt's.

01:25:18.983 --> 01:25:21.681
It's time
for my own resurrection.

01:25:23.509 --> 01:25:25.424
W-W-Wait.

01:25:26.773 --> 01:25:28.340
You're not leaving me behind.

01:25:28.384 --> 01:25:30.603
We could attempt
a double retrieval.

01:25:30.647 --> 01:25:33.084
What do you mean? Like,
one retriever, two people?

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:36.914
Mathematically, the odds
of that working are...

01:25:36.957 --> 01:25:39.308
slim. We might transfer
into thin air.

01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:42.311
And if we return successfully,
Ahmed will be waiting for us.

01:25:42.354 --> 01:25:44.139
Alright, stop sugar coating
and let's go.

01:25:47.490 --> 01:25:48.578
Take this.

01:25:54.975 --> 01:25:56.542
Put your hand in here.

01:26:00.242 --> 01:26:02.287
Three, two, one.

01:26:02.896 --> 01:26:05.029
[electrical static]

01:26:05.072 --> 01:26:07.249
[gunfire]

01:26:08.032 --> 01:26:11.035
-[groaning]
-Hey! Oh, no!

01:26:11.078 --> 01:26:15.909
-Simon! I'll help you.
-[grunts]

01:26:15.953 --> 01:26:17.128
[alarm ringing]

01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:22.481
Hang on, I got
to deactivate the doors.

01:26:37.409 --> 01:26:40.760
Don't worry. If I can run
the default program,

01:26:40.804 --> 01:26:43.198
then none of what has happened
will have happened.

01:26:43.241 --> 01:26:44.851
All these
time continuums will erase.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.726
Einstein, initiate
"Mom and Dad Default."

01:26:49.769 --> 01:26:51.249
Coordinates authorized.

01:26:51.293 --> 01:26:52.946
Einstein,
re-sync my retriever.

01:26:52.990 --> 01:26:54.731
Retriever synced.

01:26:56.863 --> 01:26:58.778
-[electrical static]
-I gotta go.

01:26:59.431 --> 01:27:02.217
The second I'm gone,
you have to destroy Einstein.

01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.306
Fire into the hard drive.

01:27:04.349 --> 01:27:07.744
Wait. [gasping]

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:10.964
Do you think He's legit?

01:27:11.008 --> 01:27:13.619
-Who?
-Jesus.

01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:16.753
You're asking the wrong guy.

01:27:22.933 --> 01:27:24.369
[grunts]

01:27:27.285 --> 01:27:29.026
He said He believed
He was God?

01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:33.900
If He believed it, then--
then maybe you should, too.

01:27:35.554 --> 01:27:39.341
-Should I?
-He spoke English to you, man.

01:27:39.384 --> 01:27:40.603
Who else could do that?

01:27:40.646 --> 01:27:43.606
[chuckles and coughing]

01:27:43.649 --> 01:27:46.130
I'm mad at God
for all of this.

01:27:47.566 --> 01:27:50.221
How can I be mad at something
that doesn't exist?

01:27:50.787 --> 01:27:53.224
Yeah. That's Ram logic.

01:27:56.575 --> 01:27:57.837
I'm gonna fix this,

01:27:58.925 --> 01:28:00.057
but if I can't,

01:28:01.754 --> 01:28:03.669
I'm sure he's got a place
for you in heaven.

01:28:06.019 --> 01:28:12.156
[cries] It's probably
a frat house with lots of beer.

01:28:12.199 --> 01:28:15.420
-I think I like that.
-Simon.

01:28:16.378 --> 01:28:19.685
Simon? [cries]

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:24.124
I love you, brother. [cries]

01:28:29.565 --> 01:28:30.783
[gunfire]

01:28:34.047 --> 01:28:35.440
Go after him!

01:28:38.965 --> 01:28:40.315
You, too. Go.

01:28:42.752 --> 01:28:44.101
[gunfire]

01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:05.644
-[gun clicking]
-Oh.

01:29:05.688 --> 01:29:07.167
You're so pathetic.

01:29:07.211 --> 01:29:10.170
It's empty, imbecile.

01:29:13.739 --> 01:29:16.481

01:29:26.186 --> 01:29:27.187
Drop it.

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.986
[explosion]

01:29:44.640 --> 01:29:45.815
[sighs]

01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:52.430
Any last words before I wipe
that smirk off your face?

01:29:52.474 --> 01:29:57.827
Chronologically speaking,
that would be an inaccurate
sequence of events.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.872
You should go first.

01:30:12.232 --> 01:30:15.148
This makes no sense.
[grunts]

01:30:15.192 --> 01:30:17.412
-[screams]
-Please.

01:30:17.455 --> 01:30:19.588
[Ahmed] I will kill your father
in seven seconds

01:30:19.631 --> 01:30:22.025
if you do not give me that code.

01:30:22.068 --> 01:30:24.984
Six, five--

01:30:25.028 --> 01:30:26.246
[gunfire]

01:30:31.251 --> 01:30:32.427
Get down!

01:30:32.992 --> 01:30:34.690
[gunfire]

01:30:37.606 --> 01:30:40.652
-Hey. You alright?
-We're fine.

01:30:40.696 --> 01:30:42.611
I've got a knife
in my front pocket.
Cut us loose.

01:30:43.655 --> 01:30:45.831
Are you okay?
What is going on?

01:30:45.875 --> 01:30:47.703
I've created a time machine.

01:30:47.746 --> 01:30:49.661
-Ahmed used it to kill Jesus.
-What?

01:30:49.705 --> 01:30:51.358
I have to go back
and kill Ahmed.

01:30:51.402 --> 01:30:54.840
-What?
-What are you talking about?

01:30:54.884 --> 01:30:57.756
I don't have time. My time
in this continuum's expiring.

01:30:58.583 --> 01:31:01.760
-[grunts]
-Oh, my God.

01:31:04.154 --> 01:31:06.025
Get Amy!
Bring her to my office.

01:31:06.069 --> 01:31:07.070
I'm on it.

01:31:09.812 --> 01:31:13.337
Anything that happens
from this moment--

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:14.556
[cellphone beeps / vibrates]

01:31:15.557 --> 01:31:17.428
Brandt!
Meet me in my office.

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:19.038
Ram has escaped
and he's trying to kill me.

01:31:21.911 --> 01:31:23.826
[action music]

01:31:36.142 --> 01:31:37.840
[gunfire]

01:31:41.583 --> 01:31:43.193
[breathes heavily]

01:31:55.161 --> 01:31:58.600
-[grunts]
-Toss your weapon over there!

01:32:00.166 --> 01:32:01.211
Okay.

01:32:07.913 --> 01:32:08.827
Get over there.

01:32:09.872 --> 01:32:12.265
-Move!
-Be careful, be careful.

01:32:15.834 --> 01:32:18.358
You killed my parents.
Now you're gonna pay.

01:32:18.402 --> 01:32:21.579
I don't know what you're
taking about. That wasn't me.

01:32:21.623 --> 01:32:23.102
You killed Amy.

01:32:23.146 --> 01:32:25.627
Kid, I-I haven't killed anyone.

01:32:25.670 --> 01:32:28.717
You haven't done it yet,
but you're going to.

01:32:28.760 --> 01:32:31.284
I would shoot you
right now, but--

01:32:32.721 --> 01:32:35.288
but I can't get His words
out of my head.

01:32:35.332 --> 01:32:36.289
Whose words?

01:32:37.552 --> 01:32:39.205
All I was trying to do

01:32:39.815 --> 01:32:42.731
is get trade secrets
from you that you were stealing.

01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:44.384
Whatever else happened,

01:32:45.647 --> 01:32:46.909
that wasn't me.

01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:52.479
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

01:32:52.523 --> 01:32:54.525
You're just saying that
because I have a gun on you.

01:32:59.138 --> 01:33:00.270
[dramatic music]

01:33:01.619 --> 01:33:05.536
Kid, I've lost everything
that I've ever loved.

01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:08.670
I lost my wife.

01:33:10.628 --> 01:33:12.499
I lost my little girls.

01:33:13.675 --> 01:33:15.415
I'm doing things now that

01:33:17.679 --> 01:33:19.898
I know that they
would be ashamed of me for.

01:33:23.685 --> 01:33:28.820
Maybe you're right. Maybe I do
kill Amy. I don't know anymore.

01:33:31.475 --> 01:33:32.868
But you pulling that trigger--

01:33:34.957 --> 01:33:36.219
You'll be doing me a favor.

01:33:39.265 --> 01:33:41.833
So do it. Do it.

01:33:42.921 --> 01:33:44.880
You don't deserve
my forgiveness.

01:33:47.273 --> 01:33:51.060
You hurt me. You killed Amy.

01:33:52.757 --> 01:33:56.282
You're right. Please...

01:33:59.024 --> 01:34:01.766
send me to my family.
Shoot me.

01:34:03.420 --> 01:34:04.290
Please.

01:34:05.335 --> 01:34:07.467
Just do it. Do it, do it.
[crying]

01:34:11.341 --> 01:34:17.390
[cries] I have to do this.
For me. For Amy.

01:34:18.217 --> 01:34:20.393
I... I...

01:34:22.004 --> 01:34:23.483
I forgive you.

01:34:25.834 --> 01:34:28.750
I for- I forgive you.

01:34:28.793 --> 01:34:30.752
[sobbing]

01:34:35.670 --> 01:34:36.714
I forgive you.

01:34:41.763 --> 01:34:44.591
[breathes heavily]

01:34:45.331 --> 01:34:46.202
I did it.

01:34:52.208 --> 01:34:54.253
Stay down. Stay down.

01:35:00.651 --> 01:35:04.611
Dad, stop.
I chased Ahmed in here.

01:35:14.012 --> 01:35:18.800
Drop your weapons,
or I'll splatter
her brains all over the room.

01:35:18.843 --> 01:35:20.671
-[cries]
-Put your gun down
or I'll kill Brandt.

01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:26.895
-[laughs] Be my guest.
-[Amy grunts]

01:35:28.461 --> 01:35:29.724
[gunshot]

01:35:29.767 --> 01:35:31.377
[Amy screams] Ram!

01:35:31.421 --> 01:35:32.770
Get his gun!

01:35:32.814 --> 01:35:35.512
[groaning]

01:35:37.340 --> 01:35:40.169
You know I'll stop at nothing
to get the secret
to time travel.

01:35:41.605 --> 01:35:44.260
[gasping] We've been
through this before.

01:35:45.870 --> 01:35:48.046
Go ahead and kill them.

01:35:48.090 --> 01:35:50.527
He is lying! Let me just--

01:35:51.528 --> 01:35:53.660
Forgive me
if I don't believe you.

01:35:55.053 --> 01:35:56.794
[gunshot]

01:35:56.838 --> 01:35:59.188
-[screaming]
-[groans]

01:36:01.886 --> 01:36:04.323
-[grunts]
-Either give me the code,

01:36:04.367 --> 01:36:07.109
or his next shot will be
in her kneecaps. Which is it?

01:36:09.589 --> 01:36:12.941
Fine by me. Six, five--

01:36:12.984 --> 01:36:15.117
[Ram] Stop! Please stop.

01:36:18.294 --> 01:36:22.080
-W-Who's talking to me?
-Stop playing games.

01:36:23.125 --> 01:36:25.867
No game.
I-I'm hearing a woman's voice.

01:36:29.174 --> 01:36:32.395
She wants me to deliver
a message. [gasps]

01:36:32.438 --> 01:36:36.268
Okay, I'll play
your little game.
What's the message?

01:36:38.183 --> 01:36:39.924
[slow music]

01:36:42.884 --> 01:36:44.407
Be a hero.

01:36:45.277 --> 01:36:46.626
How sweet.

01:36:46.670 --> 01:36:48.367
But totally irrelevant.

01:36:48.411 --> 01:36:52.415
-Four, three--
-Stop! Please! Just--

01:36:52.458 --> 01:36:58.377
-Change of heart?
-Yes! Yes! Yes.

01:37:01.728 --> 01:37:04.819
Please. I forgave Brandt.

01:37:04.862 --> 01:37:08.953
If you're ever gonna show up,
now is the time. Please.

01:37:09.867 --> 01:37:12.348
[cries]

01:37:13.088 --> 01:37:17.309
How touching.
Wrong God, wrong time.

01:37:18.093 --> 01:37:22.010
-Two, one--
-[gunfire]

01:37:29.713 --> 01:37:31.846
If you die before telling me,

01:37:33.151 --> 01:37:37.199
I guarantee you they'll be
cursing your name from day
after day of torture.

01:37:38.026 --> 01:37:42.030
No matter what I do,
you'll still kill us all.

01:37:43.074 --> 01:37:46.425
[chuckles] True,

01:37:47.557 --> 01:37:50.125
but if you give me my code,

01:37:50.168 --> 01:37:53.606
they die quickly.
Say goodbye to your mother.

01:37:55.391 --> 01:37:56.914
-No!
-No, please.

01:38:05.880 --> 01:38:08.708
[groans] You forgave Brandt.
Forgive me!

01:38:08.752 --> 01:38:12.625
Don't worry. You'll only be dead
in this time continuum.

01:38:13.365 --> 01:38:15.324
[grunts]

01:38:27.771 --> 01:38:31.079
Will some... one roll me over?

01:38:34.169 --> 01:38:36.127
[Amy] Are you unable...?

01:38:37.781 --> 01:38:39.261
I- I can't feel anything.

01:38:39.304 --> 01:38:42.525
[grunting]

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.268
[Brandt] Move my head.

01:38:47.617 --> 01:38:49.445
Push the button on my jacket.

01:38:51.751 --> 01:38:52.839
Urgent.

01:38:53.623 --> 01:38:55.581
Everyone lay down
their weapons!

01:38:55.625 --> 01:38:58.149
-Captain McCoy.
-Yes, sir. I'm here.

01:38:58.193 --> 01:39:02.458
It's okay. Ahmed, Sabeer, Kabil,

01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:08.159
and the in-house agents
are part of a terrorist network.

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:13.469
Champion National
is now in control.

01:39:13.512 --> 01:39:14.731
Copy that, sir. We're on it.

01:39:17.603 --> 01:39:19.388
[gunfire]

01:39:23.566 --> 01:39:24.523
[Brandt] Ram.

01:39:26.656 --> 01:39:28.049
Was it her?

01:39:28.701 --> 01:39:30.529
-Who?
-Diane...

01:39:32.444 --> 01:39:36.622
my wife.
Is she the voice you heard?

01:39:36.666 --> 01:39:38.624
I- I don't know.

01:39:40.757 --> 01:39:42.280
British accent?

01:39:45.283 --> 01:39:48.417
-It's her. That's her.
-[Amy] Hang on.

01:39:48.460 --> 01:39:51.811
-We're gonna get you some help.
-I don't have much time.

01:39:51.855 --> 01:39:53.726
I need to know something.

01:39:53.770 --> 01:39:55.206
Did I fix time?

01:39:57.165 --> 01:40:00.733
-Was it broken?
-Yeah, badly.

01:40:01.430 --> 01:40:05.042
Use your Bible app to read
to me what happened
when they captured Jesus.

01:40:05.956 --> 01:40:07.088
Okay. [sniffles]

01:40:10.004 --> 01:40:11.048
Okay.

01:40:12.006 --> 01:40:15.139
"The men seized Jesus
and arrested him.

01:40:15.183 --> 01:40:18.142
Then one of those standing near
drew his sword

01:40:18.186 --> 01:40:22.407
and struck the servant
of the high priest,
cutting off his ear."

01:40:22.451 --> 01:40:24.105
Good. Keep going.

01:40:24.148 --> 01:40:27.543
"'Am I leading a rebellion,'
said Jesus,

01:40:27.586 --> 01:40:30.198
-that you have come out
with swords..."
-Skip that part.

01:40:31.634 --> 01:40:34.158
"Then everyone deserted
him and fled.

01:40:34.202 --> 01:40:37.857
A young man, wearing nothing
but a linen garment

01:40:37.901 --> 01:40:40.773
was following Jesus.
When they seized him,

01:40:40.817 --> 01:40:43.820
he fled naked, leaving
his garment behind."

01:40:47.171 --> 01:40:51.306
Tell him that we made history.

01:40:51.349 --> 01:40:53.177
[crying] Tell who?

01:40:56.963 --> 01:40:58.922
[dramatic music]

01:41:09.933 --> 01:41:12.022
Hey, guys, I think
you're gonna want to see this.

01:41:13.806 --> 01:41:17.984
[electrical static]

01:41:22.119 --> 01:41:25.079
-What just happened?
-It's complicated.

01:41:27.472 --> 01:41:29.605
[Ram] I can't believe I let
you guys talk me into this.

01:41:29.648 --> 01:41:32.477
Really? 'Cause I'm pretty sure
this started off as your idea.

01:41:32.521 --> 01:41:35.828
[chuckles] No doubt about it.
Ram is a bleeding heart now.

01:41:36.655 --> 01:41:39.571
Don't tease him when he's
finally showing signs of growth.

01:41:39.615 --> 01:41:42.835
-Let's do this.
-If the time is accurate

01:41:42.879 --> 01:41:47.144
on the police report
and I succeed, then this moment
will have never existed.

01:41:48.450 --> 01:41:49.407
[sighs]

01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:57.415
Hey. Be careful.

01:41:58.460 --> 01:42:01.985
I'm, like,
the smartest man in the world.
What could possibly go wrong?

01:42:02.028 --> 01:42:05.075
Okay, smartest man in the world.
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:42:05.815 --> 01:42:08.078
I'm sorry. I love you.

01:42:08.122 --> 01:42:11.212
And I love you, but that's not
what you're forgetting.

01:42:13.039 --> 01:42:14.998
That's not what
you're forgetting, either.

01:42:15.041 --> 01:42:16.608
Oh. You want to pray.

01:42:17.261 --> 01:42:20.830
I probably should be praying
for you right now, but...

01:42:24.225 --> 01:42:27.619
[sighs] Right.
Thank God for you.

01:42:28.359 --> 01:42:30.448
You should try
to remember that.

01:42:30.492 --> 01:42:32.450
Theoretically, I won't be able
to remember any of this

01:42:32.494 --> 01:42:35.192
since the time continuum
is gonna--

01:42:38.239 --> 01:42:40.893
Get off me, man. Get off me.

01:42:42.634 --> 01:42:44.201
-Go.
-Okay.

01:42:44.897 --> 01:42:46.203
Felix, fire it up.

01:42:46.247 --> 01:42:48.727
[electrical static]

01:42:59.477 --> 01:43:00.522
[Brandt] Back two.

01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:07.964
I'm the hero to others,

01:43:11.185 --> 01:43:12.403
but I get nothing.

01:43:14.318 --> 01:43:16.102
[dramatic music]

01:43:18.496 --> 01:43:22.587
Please... have mercy.

01:43:27.679 --> 01:43:28.767
Take me home.

01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:34.120
Hey.

01:43:36.035 --> 01:43:36.993
You okay?

01:43:38.342 --> 01:43:40.953
[voice breaking]
I'm having this feeling

01:43:42.041 --> 01:43:47.873
that God is about to do
something really miraculous
through you.

01:43:50.963 --> 01:43:55.098
-[electrical static]
-[horn honking]

01:43:56.404 --> 01:43:58.449
[Diane] It's okay. It's okay.

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.713
-You guys okay?
-We are.

01:44:09.112 --> 01:44:12.333
-Am I seeing things?
-I saw him, too.

01:44:12.376 --> 01:44:14.900
-Me, too.
-Where'd he go?

01:44:15.597 --> 01:44:19.165
He saved us, Daddy.
Was he an angel?

01:44:19.775 --> 01:44:21.690
Well, girl,
I don't know what that was.

01:44:23.692 --> 01:44:25.737
Who's Ram Goldstein?

01:44:25.781 --> 01:44:28.697
I think he's one of the kid
geniuses from the lab.

01:44:34.093 --> 01:44:38.533
"Confidential.
You're going to need
the FBI and Homeland Security.

01:44:39.795 --> 01:44:42.885
P.S." [cries quietly]

01:44:44.930 --> 01:44:46.584
"Time to be a hero."

01:44:47.890 --> 01:44:49.674
[cries]

01:44:52.373 --> 01:44:54.375
Girls, I don't know
what just happened,

01:44:55.506 --> 01:44:57.334
but I think God was looking out
for our family.

01:44:59.858 --> 01:45:01.947
[epic music]

01:45:44.425 --> 01:45:46.078
What- what is she doing?

01:45:47.515 --> 01:45:51.345
-Sign language.
-Okay, but what is she saying?

01:45:52.084 --> 01:45:54.652
She is saying... you're a moron.

01:45:56.437 --> 01:45:58.003
How would she
even know that?

01:46:02.704 --> 01:46:05.402
-[alarm blaring / door opening]
-[gunfire]

01:46:06.795 --> 01:46:10.059
Targets are down. Let's go.

01:46:15.673 --> 01:46:16.718
[gasps]

01:46:17.588 --> 01:46:19.155
[coughs]

01:46:25.074 --> 01:46:26.554
[grunts]

01:46:29.687 --> 01:46:30.732
Amy.

01:46:34.170 --> 01:46:37.303
[grunts] Amy.

01:46:42.744 --> 01:46:48.880
I'm gonna fix this.
I'm gonna get you help. [grunts]

01:46:58.542 --> 01:47:02.241
Thirty years into the future,
Emergency Entrance,

01:47:02.285 --> 01:47:05.854
Metro City Community Hospital.

01:47:08.465 --> 01:47:10.772
Initiate in one minute.

01:47:11.642 --> 01:47:15.167
-Delete all files.
-[whirring / electrical static]

01:47:23.654 --> 01:47:26.440
I got you. [grunts]

01:47:28.224 --> 01:47:30.618
[electrical static]

01:47:35.449 --> 01:47:37.494
[gunfire]

01:47:53.423 --> 01:47:56.078
[helicopter blades whirring]

01:48:01.692 --> 01:48:03.694
[man 1] He's clean,
too- no marking chip.

01:48:08.133 --> 01:48:10.658
[man 2] We need to find out
why the Antichrist wants them.
