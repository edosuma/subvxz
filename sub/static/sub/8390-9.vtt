WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.093
- YOU WILL NEVER GUESS
WHO I KEEP RUNNING INTO.

00:03.140 --> 00:05.654
JIM KAZINSKY.
- OH, JIM KAZINSKY.

00:05.690 --> 00:07.658
HE WAS REAL CUTE.

00:07.690 --> 00:09.248
- OH, MY GOD.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.202
- YOU'RE MORE BEAUTIFUL
THAN I REMEMBER YOU.

00:11.250 --> 00:13.070
- REALLY?
STOP TALKING.

00:13.110 --> 00:14.657
- I GOT IT.
IT'S NOT ME, IT'S YOU.

00:14.700 --> 00:18.113
- EXACTLY.
IT'S NOT YOU. IT'S ME.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.287
- DADDY, THIS IS STEVE.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.730
- IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO MEET YOU, SIR.

00:20.770 --> 00:22.249
- WHAT'S UP?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.394
- YOU ROBBED ME
OF FIVE YEARS OF MY SON'S LIFE.

00:24.430 --> 00:26.182
- WHY DON'T YOU COME JOIN ME
IN THE LIVING ROOM?

00:26.230 --> 00:28.676
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

00:35.790 --> 00:38.167
- WELL, YOU WANT TO TELL ME
HOW THIS HAPPENED, BUG?

00:38.210 --> 00:40.269
- YOU KNOW SKIPPY
FROM NEXT DOOR?

00:40.310 --> 00:42.278
HE RAN IN
AND KNOCKED IT DOWN.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.278
- HUH.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.481
YOU KNOW, THE MONROES
DON'T HAVE A DOG ANYMORE.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.101
- SKIPPY CAME BACK.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.482
- SKIPPY'S. ..

00:50.530 --> 00:52.248
SKIPPY WENT TO THE COUNTRY

00:52.290 --> 00:53.769
AFI'ER THAT THING WITH THE CAR.

00:53.810 --> 00:55.186
I DON'T THINK
HE'S COMING BACK.

00:55.220 --> 00:55.879
- WELL, HE DID.

00:55.910 --> 00:57.116
- JOEL, DON'T.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.560
WHOEVER BROKE IT
WILL CLEAN IT UP.

00:59.610 --> 01:01.225
- SKIPPY DOESN'T KNOW
HOW TO CLEAN, MOM.

01:01.260 --> 01:03.080
- SKIPPY DIDN'T
BREAK THE VASE, BUG.

01:03.130 --> 01:05.405
- YES, HE DID.
I SAW HIM.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.125
- THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR LYING.

01:08.170 --> 01:09.239
- BUT YOU'RE A LIAR.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.135
- NO, BABY, I'M A LAWYER.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.276
- HARMONY'S MOM
SAID THEY'RE THE SAME THING.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.177
- [clears throat]

01:19.210 --> 01:21.178
JUST TELL ME THE TRUTH.

01:21.210 --> 01:22.654
DID YOU BREAK THE VASE?

01:22.700 --> 01:25.146
- NO.
DID YOU?

01:40.230 --> 01:43.199
- HEY, IS THAT
PERIODIC TABLE TEST TODAY?

01:43.240 --> 01:45.162
- OH. UM, NO.

01:45.200 --> 01:46.713
NO, IT'S ACTUALLY MONDAY.

01:46.760 --> 01:48.546
- COOL.

01:51.620 --> 01:54.623
LOOK.
LET THE GAMES BEGIN.

01:54.660 --> 01:57.834
JEEZ. YOU KNOW, THEY SHOULD
JUST USE THE MONEY FOR THE DANCE

01:57.870 --> 02:00.930
FOR, LIKE, A VENDING MACHINE
OR SOMETHING.

02:00.980 --> 02:03.528
- ACTUALLY, I WAS GONNA GO.

02:03.570 --> 02:05.185
I MEAN, WHY NOT, RIGHT?

02:05.220 --> 02:07.279
- YEAH. YEAH.

02:07.330 --> 02:08.490
- SEE YA.

02:08.540 --> 02:12.226
- OKAY.

02:15.200 --> 02:15.950
DOES IT EVEN MATTER

02:15.990 --> 02:17.548
WHAT I WEAR
TO A SCHOOL DANCE?

02:17.580 --> 02:18.478
- OF COURSE IT MATTERS,

02:18.510 --> 02:19.499
BECAUSE LINDSAY IS THERE,

02:19.550 --> 02:21.165
AND YOU'VE HAD A CRUSH
ON LINDSAY FOR FOREVER,

02:21.210 --> 02:22.370
AND YOU ARE, LIKE,
IN LOVE WITH HER,

02:22.410 --> 02:23.377
AND IF YOU DON'T LOOK GOOD,

02:23.410 --> 02:24.445
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE INTO YOU.

02:24.480 --> 02:28.177
- I NEED YOU TO PICK
FIVE SCHOOLS,

02:28.210 --> 02:30.201
BECAUSE WE ARE GOING
ON YOUR COLLEGE TOUR.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.342
THERE'S A BUNCH
OF CATALOGUES HERE.

02:31.390 --> 02:32.175
- I REALLY THINK
THIS IS CUTE.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.448
WAIT A SECOND.
THE COLLEGE TOUR?

02:33.490 --> 02:34.730
I THOUGHT
WE COULDN'T AFFORD IT.

02:34.770 --> 02:35.930
- YES. NO, WELL,
I PICKED UP EXTRA SHIFTS,

02:35.980 --> 02:37.072
'CAUSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT,

02:37.120 --> 02:38.735
AND YOU'RE GONNA COME
WORK WITH ME TOMORROW NIGHT.

02:38.770 --> 02:39.634
- OH, AT THE BAR?

02:39.670 --> 02:41.706
- NO, WE HAVE
A CATERING GIG AT CAL,

02:41.740 --> 02:43.913
- THIS IS IN THE TOP CHOICES.

02:43.950 --> 02:46.601
AND SO YOU'RE GONNA...
- POETRY READING?

02:46.640 --> 02:49.200
YEAH, I'D ACTUALLY
RATHER SELL AN ORGAN,

02:49.230 --> 02:50.299
BUT THANKS FOR INVITING ME.
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,

02:50.340 --> 02:51.602
IF YOU DON'T CHANGE
THAT ATI'ITUDE,

02:51.650 --> 02:53.265
IT MAY COME TO THAT,
'CAUSE I DON'T THINK

02:53.310 --> 02:54.572
YOU NEED BOTH LIVERS,
ANYWAY.

02:54.620 --> 02:55.951
- WHAT ABOUT THIS?
- THAT'S NOT GOOD.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.069
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT ME

02:57.100 --> 03:00.228
GIVING LI'I'I'LE TINY
HORS D'OEUVRES TO ENGLISH MAJORS

03:00.280 --> 03:02.248
IS GONNA MAKE ME
WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE?

03:02.280 --> 03:04.202
- WELL, WHAT IS GONNA
MAKE YOU WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE?

03:04.250 --> 03:05.524
- NOTHING,
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GO.

03:05.560 --> 03:07.972
- YOU DON'T SEEM TO GET
THAT THIS IS THE YEAR.

03:08.010 --> 03:09.625
THIS IS YOUR JUNIOR YEAR.

03:09.670 --> 03:11.285
THIS IS THE YEAR
THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE

03:11.320 --> 03:13.288
BETWEEN
"PAGING DR. BRAVERMAN"

03:13.330 --> 03:14.945
OR "DO YOU WANT
FRIES WITH THAT?"

03:14.980 --> 03:15.901
THIS IS THE YEAR.

03:15.950 --> 03:16.871
- REALLY? DR. BRAVERMAN?
I DON'T THINK SO.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.911
- YES, IT'S POSSIBLE.
IF YOU JUST--UGH.

03:18.950 --> 03:22.329
JUST PICK FIVE SCHOOLS, AMBER.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.952
WHY IS IT SO HARD?
THAT'S CUTE. WEAR THAT.

03:24.990 --> 03:25.979
- IT'S CUTE, RIGHT?

03:26.030 --> 03:28.407
- HONEY, LISTEN,
IF YOU'RE GONNA WEAR A T-SHIRT,

03:28.440 --> 03:29.953
WEAR A BLAZER, OKAY?

03:30.000 --> 03:31.820

03:46.670 --> 03:50.731
[TV continues indistinct]

03:50.780 --> 03:51.735
- OH, COME ON.

03:51.780 --> 03:52.735
HE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE IT

03:52.780 --> 03:53.849
TO THE FLYING BIKES PART.

03:53.880 --> 03:54.812
- IT'S TOO LATE.

03:54.850 --> 03:56.010
- YOU DON'T WANT
TO WAKE HIM UP?

03:56.060 --> 03:57.015

05:03.820 --> 05:05.811

05:22.180 --> 05:25.069
IT'S HUGE. I MEAN, YOU WERE

05:25.110 --> 05:26.589

ARE YOU TELLING ME TO DO IT?

05:26.630 --> 05:28.109

05:28.150 --> 05:30.141

05:31.570 --> 05:33.083
I WON'T BE GONE

05:33.120 --> 05:35.463
WHAT IS THIS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.569
JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING-SOMETHING

05:36.610 --> 05:38.328
THAT CAME IN THE MAIL TODAY.

05:39.470 --> 05:40.744

05:50.210 --> 05:52.758
THIS LEFT BOOB IS A LITTLE BIT
BIGGER THAN THE RIGHT.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.108

05:54.140 --> 05:55.129
[purrs]

05:55.180 --> 05:57.102

HADDIE?

- HEY, IS MAX AWAKE YET?

07:16.850 --> 07:18.158
- UM, YEAH,
I THINK HE'S JUST CHANGING.

07:18.190 --> 07:19.669
- OH, OKAY, GOOD.

07:19.710 --> 07:21.564
OH, BEFORE I FORGET,

07:21.610 --> 07:24.670
A PACKAGE
CAME FOR YOU YESTERDAY.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.982
FROM VICTORIA'S SECRET?

07:26.030 --> 07:27.509
IT GOT OPENED ACCIDENTALLY.

07:27.550 --> 07:29.882
I'M NOT SURE HOW.
IT JUST--

07:30.620 --> 07:32.064
-MOM?
-HMM?

07:32.100 --> 07:34.239
- HOW WOULD A PACKAGE
WITH MY NAME ON IT

07:34.280 --> 07:35.440
GET OPENED ACCIDENTALLY?

07:36.140 --> 07:37.516
- WELL, I THINK YOUR FATHER

07:37.560 --> 07:38.686
ASSUMED THAT IT WAS FOR ME,

07:38.730 --> 07:40.960
SO THEREFORE HE OPENED IT.
- OH, THAT'S REALLY GROSS.

07:41.010 --> 07:43.035
- ANYWAY, HE THREW IT AWAY,
SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.

07:43.080 --> 07:43.933
- WHAT?
- MM-HMM.

07:43.980 --> 07:45.242
HE WAS GONNA BURN IT,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

07:45.290 --> 07:46.837
HE FIGURED PROBABLY NOT
A GOOD IDEA.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.279
- MOM,
I SPENT MY MONEY ON THAT.

07:48.320 --> 07:49.287
THAT'S EXPENSIVE.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.524
- I KNOW THAT YOU DID.

07:50.570 --> 07:54.779
THAT'S WHY I RESCUED IT.

07:54.810 --> 07:57.085
- THANK YOU.

07:57.130 --> 08:00.987
- SO, HADDIE, CAN I
JUST ASK YOU A QUESTION?

08:01.030 --> 08:03.305
WHY WOULD YOU BUY YOURSELF
A BRA LIKE THAT?

08:03.340 --> 08:05.023
- I'M NOT GONNA
TALK ABOUT THIS WITH YOU.

08:05.070 --> 08:06.617
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S FINE.

08:06.650 --> 08:08.026
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO DAD ABOUT IT, THEN,

08:08.070 --> 08:09.753
BECAUSE HE'S REALLY CURIOUS
AS TO WHY...

08:09.790 --> 08:11.109
- OH, YOU WOULD NOT DO THAT.
- YES, I WOULD.

08:11.140 --> 08:12.175
I'LL CALL HIM RIGHT NOW.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.838
- ALL RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW? JUST ASK.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.758
- DID YOU BUY THAT BRA
FOR STEVE?

08:17.800 --> 08:20.075
- MOM...
- HMM?

08:20.120 --> 08:21.690
- YOU KNOW STEVE
DOESN'T HAVE BOOBS.

08:21.740 --> 08:23.560
I'M NOT GONNA BUY HIM A BRA.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.942
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

08:24.980 --> 08:27.608
- HADDIE,
DID YOU BUY IT FOR STEVE?

08:27.640 --> 08:30.939
- NO, OKAY? I BOUGHT IT
FOR MYSELF, ALL RIGHT?

08:30.990 --> 08:32.708
IT'S PRETTY AND IT'S SEXY,

08:32.750 --> 08:34.786
AND, I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WANT TO THINK ABOUT ME,

08:34.820 --> 08:35.605
BUT I'M A WOMAN.

08:35.650 --> 08:37.197
- YOU HAVE
TO PROMISE ME SOMETHING.

08:37.240 --> 08:38.992
YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
THAT YOU'RE BEING SMART,

08:39.030 --> 08:40.850
AND YOU'RE BEING CAREFUL,

08:40.890 --> 08:42.164
AND YOU'RE NOT HAVING SEX.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.098
- WHAT DO YOU THINK SEX IS?

08:44.140 --> 08:46.176
- I DON'T KNOW.
ANYTHING BEYOND MAKING OUT, OR--

08:46.210 --> 08:47.245
- THAT'S YOUR DEFINITION
OF SEX?

08:47.280 --> 08:49.202
- FOR YOU.

08:49.250 --> 08:51.866
- I THINK I HAVE
TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL.

08:51.910 --> 08:53.866
LIKE YOU SAID,
I CAN'T BE LATE AGAIN.

08:53.910 --> 08:56.117
- I TRUST YOU.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.042
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU THINK YOU MADE OUT WITH HER?

09:01.090 --> 09:02.114
- IT'S THE MOTHER
OF MY CHILD.

09:02.160 --> 09:04.185
- SO WHAT, THAT'S SOMEHOW
WARPED YOUR MEMORY?

09:04.230 --> 09:05.777
- I WATCHED THE VIDEO

09:05.820 --> 09:07.913
OF MY SON COMING OUT
OF HER INSIDES.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.643
- OH, OH,
HUGE MISTAKE FOR YOU.

09:09.680 --> 09:10.647
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.851
- HUGE MISTAKE.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.881
- YEAH, NO MAN SHOULD HAVE
TO WITNESS THAT UNPREPARED.

09:13.930 --> 09:15.090
LEAST OF ALL YOU.
- IT'S EXTREME.

09:15.140 --> 09:16.368
- YEAH, YOU THINK
YOU'RE GONNA RECOVER?

09:16.410 --> 09:18.890
- DOES IT RECOVER?

09:18.930 --> 09:20.170
- YEAH.
YEAH, IT DOES. IN TIME.

09:20.210 --> 09:21.245
- SO KRISTINA IS...?

09:21.280 --> 09:22.963
- A--BA, BA, BA.

09:23.010 --> 09:24.034
- OKAY.

09:24.900 --> 09:26.140
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
YOU GUYS GONNA GET TOGETHER?

09:26.180 --> 09:27.215
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK IT'S SAFER

09:27.250 --> 09:28.979
IF WE JUST STAY FRIENDS.

09:29.010 --> 09:30.352
- YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.
YOU BETTER PLAY IT SAFE.

09:30.390 --> 09:31.630
YEAH. GOOD IDEA.

09:31.670 --> 09:34.218
- WELL, LOOK, IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN WALK AWAY FROM THIS ONE.

09:34.260 --> 09:35.284
- GOOD FOR YOU, CROSBY.

09:35.330 --> 09:36.729
- BUT THEN AGAIN,
I'M ONLY HUMAN.

09:36.780 --> 09:38.702
SHE'S VERY ATTRACTIVE.
SO I DON'T KNOW.

09:38.750 --> 09:40.126
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHAT DOES JASMINE

09:40.160 --> 09:41.843
THINK ABOUT ALL THIS?
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:41.890 --> 09:43.744
- WELL, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
MAYBE ASKING HER?

09:43.790 --> 09:46.020
- YOU KNOW, I JUST--I WISH
THAT WE COULD JUST HANG OUT,

09:46.060 --> 09:48.028
YOU KNOW, WITH NO KID,
JUST THE TWO OF US,

09:48.070 --> 09:50.026
AND KIND OF
GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER AGAIN,

09:50.070 --> 09:52.129
BUT, YOU KNOW, NOW THE CART'S
IN FRONT OF THE HORSE.

09:52.170 --> 09:53.649
IT'S LIKE--
- WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING

09:53.690 --> 09:55.203
THAT PEOPLE DO
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.720
IT'S CALLED DATING.
- HMM.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.239
- HOW'S IT GOING, KRISTINA?

09:59.280 --> 10:01.908
- IT'S--I HAVE A COUPLE OF
CHOICES THAT I THINK MIGHT WORK.

10:01.940 --> 10:04.249
- COME ON.
- LET'S SEE 'EM.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.212
- TA-DA! HOW DO I LOOK?

10:06.260 --> 10:07.739
- UM...

10:07.770 --> 10:09.249
- FROM THE DAVID BYRNE
COLLECTION.

10:09.290 --> 10:10.939
- WHO'S DAVID BYRNE?
- JOAN COLLINS?

10:10.980 --> 10:12.299
- CYBIL SHEPHERD'S
LOST JACKET.

10:12.330 --> 10:13.638
- YOU'RE MAKING FUN OF ME,
AREN'T YOU?

10:13.680 --> 10:14.669
- WERE YOU ON DYNASTY?

10:14.710 --> 10:16.223
- I CAN'T DO IT.

10:16.270 --> 10:17.225
- IT'S LIKE AN EPISODE
OF HOARDERS.

10:17.270 --> 10:18.988
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU CLEANED THAT CLOSET?

10:19.030 --> 10:20.258
- OH, MY GOD.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:20.300 --> 10:21.779
MY DAUGHTER HAS A BETTER
WARDROBE THAN I DO.

10:21.820 --> 10:22.923
- KRISTINA,
LET ME FIND SOMETHING.

10:22.960 --> 10:24.234
- WE'LL HELP YOU.
SHE'LL HELP.

10:24.270 --> 10:26.443
- OH, BY THE WAY,
GUESS WHO STARTED BUYING BRAS.

10:26.480 --> 10:28.653
- WHO?
- FROM "VICTORIA SECRETS?"

10:28.690 --> 10:30.066
- YOU?
- HADDIE.

10:30.110 --> 10:31.134
- UH-OH.
- WELL, THAT'S OKAY.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.272
- YES.
VERY SEXY BRAS.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.072
- HOW BAD IS IT?
WHAT'S THE LACE TO BASE?

10:34.110 --> 10:35.418
- THE WHAT?
- IF IT'S REALLY LACEY,

10:35.460 --> 10:37.667
IT MEANS SHE'S GOING FURTHER
ON THE "BASEY."

10:37.700 --> 10:39.907
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE'S NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.

10:39.940 --> 10:40.759
- FIRST BASE IS KISSING.

10:40.810 --> 10:42.425
SECOND BASE IS--
WHAT IS SECOND BASE?

10:42.460 --> 10:44.280
- THERE'S A LOT OF LACE,
BUT SHE'S NOT DOING ANY OF THAT.

10:44.330 --> 10:46.981
- OKAY, SECOND BASE
IS READING TENNYSON.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.157
- OKAY, STOP IT.
- OKAY.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.294
AND, UM, CAN I
ASK YOU GUYS SOMETHING?

10:50.330 --> 10:52.434
WHEN DID YOUR CHILDREN
START LYING TO YOU?

10:52.470 --> 10:54.165
- UH, IT WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,
I THINK.

10:54.200 --> 10:56.953
AMBER WAS BORN, AND SHE SAID,
"IT WASN'T MY VODKA."

10:57.000 --> 10:58.444
- REALLY?
- OOH, HADDIE WAS TWO.

10:58.480 --> 11:00.209
SHE SWORE TO ME
THAT SHE DID NOT

11:00.240 --> 11:01.309
STICK A LITTLE BEAD
UP HER NOSE,

11:01.350 --> 11:02.965
AND THE DOCTOR PULLED IT OUT

11:03.000 --> 11:04.308
AND WAS LIKE,
"HERE'S THE BEAD."

11:04.350 --> 11:05.965
- SO THIS IS NORMAL?
THAT'S WHAT KIDS DO...

11:06.010 --> 11:07.272
- ESPECIALLY IN YOUR FAMILY.

11:07.320 --> 11:08.799
- WAIT. WHAT?

11:08.840 --> 11:11.729
- ESPECIALLY, YOU KNOW,
SHE'D LEARN IT FROM YOU.

11:11.770 --> 11:12.839
- WHY?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.070
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE A--
A LAWYER.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.045
THEY LIE.

11:18.090 --> 11:20.183
- OKAY, I'M NOT
GONNA GO INTO IT.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.709
- LISTEN, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

11:21.750 --> 11:22.978
IT WAS JUST A JOKE.

11:23.020 --> 11:24.464
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.
YOU'RE SO SUCCESSFUL.

11:24.510 --> 11:25.886
YOU'RE AMAZING AT YOUR JOB.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.808
THERE'S NO BETTER
ROLE MODEL OUT THERE.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.238
I SERVE LIQUOR FOR A LIVING,

11:29.270 --> 11:30.919
AND I DIDN'T GO TO COLLEGE,

11:30.960 --> 11:32.188
AND NOW AMBER
DOESN'T WANT TO GO,

11:32.240 --> 11:33.400
'CAUSE I'M SUCH
A GREAT ROLE MODEL, 50--

11:33.450 --> 11:34.519
- WAIT.
AMBER DOESN'T WANT TO GO?

11:34.550 --> 11:35.710
- SHE'S GOTTA GO
TO COLLEGE.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.239
- I CAN'T MAKE HER
DO ANYTHING.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.417
- SHE'S GOING TO COLLEGE.
- YES.

11:38.450 --> 11:40.247
- OKAY, I MEAN, YEAH.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.202
- YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM
IS FOR MOTHERS?

11:42.250 --> 11:43.831
- DAUGHTERS.
- DAUGHTERS.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.723
- AMEN.

11:44.770 --> 11:45.486
[doorbell rings]

11:48.150 --> 11:49.902
- HEY, DREW.
COME ON IN.

11:49.950 --> 11:51.042
- OH, THANKS.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.354
HEY, MAX.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.355
- YEAH, I'M FINE, BUT...

11:53.400 --> 11:54.355
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:54.400 --> 11:56.322
- OH, UM...

11:56.370 --> 12:00.192
OKAY, BASICALLY, THERE'S
A SCHOOL DANCE COMING UP,

12:00.230 --> 12:02.050
AND I'M REALLY
NERVOUS ABOUT IT,

12:02.100 --> 12:03.852
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO DANCE.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.118
THAT'S BASICALLY
WHY I'M HERE.

12:05.170 --> 12:06.307
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO ASK SOMEONE

12:06.340 --> 12:07.853
WHO'S GONNA HUMILIATE ME,

12:07.890 --> 12:08.857
MY SISTER OR SOMETHING.

12:08.900 --> 12:10.231
- ALL RIGHT, DREW,
SAY NO MORE.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.508
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO TOOT MY OWN HORN,

12:11.550 --> 12:13.370
BUT WHEN I WAS
IN HIGH SCHOOL

12:13.420 --> 12:16.241
PEOPLE USED
TO CALL ME "FEVER."

12:16.280 --> 12:18.214
SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?
JOHN TRAVOLTA?

12:18.250 --> 12:19.865
- OH, I HAVEN'T REALLY
SEEN IT, BUT...

12:19.910 --> 12:21.138
- DOESN'T MATTER.
TELL YOU WHAT.

12:21.180 --> 12:22.420
COME ON, HELP ME CLEAR OUT
SOME SPACE HERE.

12:22.460 --> 12:24.189

12:27.910 --> 12:29.775
YOU GOT TO SHUT THIS OFF,

12:30.810 --> 12:32.152
THAT'S ALL I'M SAYING, OKAY?

12:32.190 --> 12:33.327
- I'M REALLY TRYING.

12:33.370 --> 12:34.917
- LET ME FIND
THE RIGHT PIECE OF MUSIC.

12:34.960 --> 12:37.849
ALL RIGHT.
[Run-DMC's It's Tricky plays]

12:37.890 --> 12:40.438
JUST FEEL THE MUSIC.

12:46.860 --> 12:48.248
I MEANT MORE LIKE
SLOW-DANCING TYPE OF...

12:48.280 --> 12:49.793
- I KNOW SLOWDANCING,

12:49.830 --> 12:51.206
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT THE MUSIC IS, MAN.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.343
YOU JUST GOT TO--YOU GOT
TO FEEL THAT IN YOUR BODY.

12:53.390 --> 12:54.345
START HERE.
- OH, YEAH, SORRY.

12:54.390 --> 12:56.176

IN YOUR LEGS, YOUR ARMS,

YOUR FEET, SHOULDERS,
YOUR RIB CAGE.

12:58.390 --> 13:00.039
ALL OVER.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.251
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

13:01.290 --> 13:02.154
- NO, BUT NOT LIKE THAT.

13:02.190 --> 13:05.227
LIKE--LIKE WITH A PARTNER

- NO, I LIKE IT.
- COME ON, DREW. GET OUT HERE.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.991
MOST IMPORTANT THING TO DO
IS BE CONFIDENT, OKAY?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.826
YOU ASK A GIRL TO DANCE
WITH CONFIDENCE,

13:23.870 --> 13:24.859
SHE CAN'T SAY NO.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.276
- I'M SORRY.
THANK YOU, THOUGH.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.242

13:33.260 --> 13:34.909
ONCE YOU UNLEASH THE FEVER,
IT DOESN'T STOP.

13:34.950 --> 13:36.178
- WHOO!

13:36.220 --> 13:37.016
- BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:37.050 --> 13:39.564
IT'S HARD
NOT TO CATCH THE FEVER.

13:39.610 --> 13:42.465
- I'M DOING MY BEST.

13:42.510 --> 13:44.432
- IT'S TRICKY
TO ROCK A RHYME

13:44.470 --> 13:46.290
TO ROCK A RHYME
THAT'S RIGHT ON TIME

13:46.340 --> 13:48.331

13:54.410 --> 13:56.651
- YEAH, WELL, I JUST
COULDN'T STOP THINKING

13:56.690 --> 13:59.102
ABOUT JABBAR

HE'LL, UH--I'M SURE
HE'LL APPRECIATE IT.

14:07.390 --> 14:11.019
- OKAY. GOOD.

14:11.050 --> 14:14.110
LOOK, I KNOW
THIS IS KIND OF WEIRD.

14:14.160 --> 14:15.229
I MEAN,
WE ALREADY HAVE A KID,

14:15.260 --> 14:17.080
AND I'M KIND OF
DOING THIS BACKWARDS,

14:17.130 --> 14:19.360
BUT I WANT

WELL, HE WAS ONE OF

16:35.510 --> 16:37.432
THE FOUNDING FATHERS
OF THIS COUNTRY,

16:37.470 --> 16:38.744
HE WAS OUR THIRD PRESIDENT,

16:38.790 --> 16:40.781
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE
HE WAS?

16:40.820 --> 16:42.196
- MM, NO.

16:42.240 --> 16:43.161
- HE WAS A LAWYER.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.407
AS WAS OUR SECOND PRESIDENT,
JOHN ADAMS,

16:45.450 --> 16:46.781
AND MANY OF OUR
PRESIDENTS SINCE THEN.

16:46.830 --> 16:48.479
THIS COUNTRY
WAS CREATED BY LAWYERS.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.796
SO WHEN HARMONY'S MOM
SAYS THAT LAWYERS ARE LIARS,

16:51.830 --> 16:53.798
SHE'S NOT
JUST ABSOLUTELY WRONG,

16:53.840 --> 16:55.649
SHE'S KIND OF
INSULTING AMERICA ITSELF.

16:55.700 --> 16:57.042
- AND WE'RE AMERICANS?

16:57.080 --> 16:58.809

THAT'S RIGHT.

16:58.840 --> 17:00.216
AND WE'RE AN HONEST PEOPLE.

17:00.260 --> 17:01.454
SO THINK ABOUT THAT,
OKAY?

17:01.500 --> 17:02.455
- 'KAY.
- OKAY.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.467

ISN'T IT INSPIRING?
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.411
WHEN I RAN FOR SCHOOL BOARD.

18:00.450 --> 18:02.657
SHE HELPED ME
WRITE MY PLATFORM,

18:02.700 --> 18:04.725

ALTHOUGH, AFTER TONIGHT,

23:30.780 --> 23:34.056
I MIGHT RE-TITLE IT
THREE TIMES THE CHARM.

23:34.100 --> 23:37.501
THIS IS CALLED
ORCHID BLOOMING.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.996
"PARCHED GROUND

23:40.030 --> 23:42.828

24:02.020 --> 24:03.464
- IT'S ABOUT FLOWERS, RIGHT?

24:03.510 --> 24:06.126
- I THINK IT MIGHT
BE ABOUT YOUR VAG.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.957
- "...IS READY

24:07.990 --> 24:12.131

- WELL,
YOU KNOW WHY WE'RE HERE.

24:18.620 --> 24:20.861
WE WANT YOU TO ENDORSE
ASSEMBLYWOMAN BOWSER.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.891
- SHE'S GOING UP AGAINST
SOME VERY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

24:22.940 --> 24:26.592
WITH LONG MEMORIES.

24:26.630 --> 24:27.938
- SO LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

24:27.980 --> 24:30.039
WHY DID YOU RUN?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:30.080 --> 24:31.809
- THE VERY FIRST TIME
THAT YOU RAN FOR OFFICE,

24:31.840 --> 24:33.603
WHY'D YOU DO IT?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.779
- WELL, I--I GUESS
I WANTED TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

24:35.810 --> 24:36.742
- MM-HMM.

24:36.780 --> 24:38.702
YOU RAN BECAUSE
THAT REFINERY IN RICHMOND

24:38.750 --> 24:41.981
WAS DUMPING HUNDREDS OF GALLONS
OF WASTE IN THE AQUIFER.

24:42.030 --> 24:45.887
REMEMBER?

24:45.930 --> 24:47.818
SEE, I WORKED FOR THE STATE
WATER BUREAU AT THE TIME,

24:47.860 --> 24:50.203
AND THIS MAN
GOT THAT PLANT SHUT DOWN ALONE.

24:50.240 --> 24:51.207
BY HIMSELF. COMPLETELY.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.753
- THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

24:52.800 --> 24:55.587
- DUDE, I KNOW.
IT WAS A WHILE AGO, DUDE.

24:55.630 --> 24:57.200
ANYWAY, HERE'S THE DEAL.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.662
ASSEMBLYWOMAN BOWSER, SHE WANTS
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE TOO.

24:59.700 --> 25:01.691
YOU KNOW, HER OPPONENTS
MIGHT TWIT AND TALK ON--

25:01.740 --> 25:03.947
- TWEET.
- IT'S "TWEET."

25:03.980 --> 25:07.700
- T--WHATEVER,
THAT POLLUTION IS BAD,

25:07.740 --> 25:09.844
BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE ACTUALLY HAS
A PLAN TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

25:09.880 --> 25:13.156
A SOLID PLAN, STARTING WITH
BETTER REGULATION OF WATERWAYS.

25:13.200 --> 25:14.576
- YOU KNOW I LIKE HER, RIGHT?

25:14.610 --> 25:16.532
- I DO.
I KNOW THAT YOU LIKE HER.

25:16.580 --> 25:18.548
BUT...

25:18.580 --> 25:21.140
THE THING IS
IS SHE CAN'T DO IT ALONE.

25:21.170 --> 25:24.139
SEE, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

25:32.660 --> 25:34.662
- YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER
REALLY GOTTEN THE HANG

25:34.700 --> 25:37.669
OF THIS WHOLE
FORK, SPOON TECHNIQUE.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.043
- HA. WELL,
THERE'S A TRICK THAT I LEARNED

25:40.090 --> 25:42.012
WHEN I WENT TO ITALY.

25:42.050 --> 25:44.678
AND THAT IS
ORDER THE RAVIOLI.

25:44.710 --> 25:46.052
- MM.
- MM?

25:46.090 --> 25:47.569
- YOU WENT TO ITALY?

25:47.610 --> 25:49.749
- MM-HMM.
JUST FOR A FEW WEEKS.

25:49.780 --> 25:51.987
JABBAR LOVED IT.

25:52.030 --> 25:54.169
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD HIM

25:54.200 --> 25:56.373
SING O SOLE MIO
WITH THE GONDOLIER.

25:56.410 --> 25:58.332
IT WAS REALLY CUTE.

25:58.380 --> 26:01.065
- MAN, I WISH I HAD.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.029
[cell phone rings]

26:07.080 --> 26:09.389
OOH.

26:09.420 --> 26:10.864
SORRY.
IT'S MY SISTER.

26:10.910 --> 26:12.047
HELLO.

26:12.080 --> 26:13.638

I'M SO SORRY TO BOTHER YOU,

26:13.670 --> 26:15.114
BUT IT'S JABBAR.

26:15.150 --> 26:16.185
- HE WANTS TO GO HOME.

26:16.220 --> 26:17.630
- OKAY.
HE'S OKAY, THOUGH, YEAH?

26:17.670 --> 26:18.944
- HE'S UPSET ABOUT SOMETHING.

26:18.990 --> 26:20.218
HE WON'T TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING,

26:20.260 --> 26:22.012
BUT HE SAYS
IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

26:22.060 --> 26:23.368
- OKAY,
WE'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

26:23.400 --> 26:24.367
- OKAY, GREAT.
SEE YOU SOON.

26:24.410 --> 26:25.672
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT HAPPENED?

26:25.720 --> 26:27.676
- JABBAR WANTS TO GO HOME.

26:27.720 --> 26:30.188
I THINK HE'S SCARED.
- [laughs]

26:30.240 --> 26:31.207
- CHECK PLEASE.

26:31.240 --> 26:33.856

ALL RIGHT.

26:33.900 --> 26:36.653
LET'S JUST DROWN OUR SORROWS
IN SOME JUNK FOOD AND BASEBALL.

26:36.690 --> 26:38.271
SHOULD BE ABLE
TO CATCH THOSE LATE INNINGS.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.389
- HEY, HOW'D IT GO?

26:39.420 --> 26:42.935
- WELL, I TOOK YOUR DAD'S
ADVICE ABOUT CONFIDENCE.

26:42.980 --> 26:45.665
I WENT UP,
I ASKED HER TO DANCE,

26:45.700 --> 26:46.667
AND SHE SHOT ME DOWN.

26:46.700 --> 26:47.564
SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT TO,

26:47.600 --> 26:49.283
LIKE, LEAVE HER FRIEND,
OR SOMETHING,

26:49.330 --> 26:50.354
WHEN I ASKED HER TO DANCE.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.948
- WELL, YOU KNOW, MAYBE, UM,

26:52.990 --> 26:54.389
HER FRIEND WAS JEALOUS,
OR SOMETHING.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.919
LIKE, MAYBE
HER FRIEND LIKED YOU.

26:55.950 --> 26:58.885
I DON'T KNOW.
SORRY. UM...

26:58.920 --> 27:02.686
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

27:02.720 --> 27:05.336
- UM, MAX IS IN BED
AND YOU'RE HOME.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.586
- YEAH, WELL,
MAX COULD WAKE UP,

27:06.620 --> 27:09.748
AND I MIGHT HAVE TO LEAVE
ON AN EMERGENCY OR SOMETHING.

27:09.800 --> 27:11.415
YOU CAN'T GO.
YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE.

27:11.450 --> 27:12.724
- DAD?

27:12.760 --> 27:14.000

GONNA KEEP ME HERE

27:14.040 --> 27:16.008
BECAUSE I'M WEARING
THIS STUPID BRA?

27:16.040 --> 27:18.349
- OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S A BRA, SO...

WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:23.880 --> 27:25.700

27:29.060 --> 27:31.153

IF YOU DON'T WANT ME

27:32.400 --> 27:33.719
THEN I DON'T

31:02.990 --> 31:06.266
- I CAN'T GET OVER IT.

31:06.310 --> 31:08.096
JIM KAZINSKY.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.449
HE'S A PUBLISHED AUTHOR.

31:10.480 --> 31:16.453
HE USED TO COPY OFF ME
IN 10TH GRADE.

31:16.490 --> 31:18.526
- THAT'S COOL.

31:18.560 --> 31:21.620
WRITING A BUNCH OF POEMS

31:21.670 --> 31:26.039
ABOUT A BIG LOSER
GETTING LAID BY A HOT LADY.

31:26.090 --> 31:27.159
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT'S NOT NICE.

31:27.190 --> 31:30.978
HE'S NOT A LOSER.
HE'S--HE'S SUCH A SPECIAL GUY.

31:31.020 --> 31:34.126
HE MIGHT NOT BE,
YOU KNOW, MY SOUL MATE,

31:34.160 --> 31:36.606
BUT HE'S...
HE'S TALENTED.

31:36.650 --> 31:39.369
- I GUESS I WAS PROBABLY
JUST GROSSED OUT

31:39.410 --> 31:40.638
THAT I HAD TO HEAR, LIKE,

31:40.690 --> 31:43.511
15 BILLION POEMS
ABOUT MY MOTHER'S VAGOOZLE.

31:43.550 --> 31:44.653
- YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT THE POINT.

31:44.690 --> 31:47.306
THE POINT IS, THIS IS A GUY
WHO READ DYLAN THOMAS

31:47.350 --> 31:49.102
IN HIGH SCHOOL
AND WAS INSPIRED,

31:49.140 --> 31:50.698
AND THEN FOLLOWED HIS DREAM.

31:50.730 --> 31:53.415
AND LOOK AT WHAT HE'S ACHIEVED,
YOU KNOW?

31:53.460 --> 31:57.146
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT
I WANT FOR YOU, YOU KNOW?

31:57.190 --> 31:58.669
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT YOU
TO THIS SCHOOL.

31:58.700 --> 32:01.282
YOU--YOU JUST CAN'T
GIVE UP ON YOURSELF.

32:01.330 --> 32:03.639
I MEAN,
THAT'S LIVING PROOF.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.489
YOU JUST CAN'T--
YOU CAN'T GIVE UP ON YOURSELF.

32:16.580 --> 32:17.854
- ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO STAY?

32:17.900 --> 32:20.687
- YEAH, WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
CHUTES AND LADDERS TOURNAMENT.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.482
- OKAY.
GIVE ME A HUG.

32:22.520 --> 32:24.488
- TAKE NO PRISONERS.

32:24.520 --> 32:26.317
- 'KAY.

32:26.350 --> 32:27.419
COME ON.

32:27.460 --> 32:30.213
- OKAY. YOU WILL NOT
HEAR FROM ME AGAIN TONIGHT.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.387
- LET'S GO!
- THANKS.

32:31.430 --> 32:33.148
- COME ON, JULIA!
- OKAY. OKAY!

32:33.190 --> 32:35.112
- ENGLISH SOCCER FANS?

32:35.160 --> 32:36.115
- YEAH, WELL,
YOU STARTED IT

32:36.160 --> 32:38.537
WITH THE WHOLE DOORS
OPENING AND SHUTTING.

32:38.570 --> 32:40.219
- THAT'S HOW THE SONG GOES.

32:40.260 --> 32:41.704
- THAT'S NOT
HOW THE SONG GOES.

32:41.750 --> 32:43.331
- YES, IT IS.
- FOR REAL?

32:43.370 --> 32:45.122
- FOR REAL.
- OKAY.

32:45.170 --> 32:47.126
WELL, IT INSPIRED ME.

32:47.170 --> 32:50.446
- GOOD.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.062
IT INSPIRED YOU.

32:53.100 --> 32:56.342
- YOU INSPIRED ME.

32:56.380 --> 32:57.586
- I INSPIRED YOU?

32:57.630 --> 32:59.313
- YEAH.

32:59.350 --> 33:00.692
- REALLY?

33:00.730 --> 33:04.598
- BIG TIME.

33:04.630 --> 33:06.621
- ARE YOU TRYING
TO USE MY POO SONG

33:06.670 --> 33:10.538
AS A WAY TO MAKE YOUR MOVE?

33:10.570 --> 33:12.083
- YEAH.

33:12.120 --> 33:13.496
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

33:13.540 --> 33:15.701
- UM, I DON'T KNOW.

33:15.750 --> 33:18.674
WELL, YOU HAVEN'T
REALLY MADE A MOVE YET.

33:18.720 --> 33:21.359
CAN'T TELL YOU.

34:00.620 --> 34:04.169
- WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

34:04.210 --> 34:05.723
- DAD, WHAT WAS I THINKING?

34:05.760 --> 34:07.728
I MEAN, WHAT--
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

34:07.760 --> 34:09.762
- I TOLD YOU TO STAY AT HOME,
AND YOU JUST TOOK OFF.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.722
- YEAH, WELL, YOU WERE
BEING TOTALLY UNREASONABLE.

34:11.770 --> 34:13.806
- WELL, I DON'T CARE IF
I'M BEING UNREASONABLE, HADDIE.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.569
YOU'RE 15 YEARS OLD

34:15.600 --> 34:16.874
AND YOU LIVE IN MY HOUSE,

34:16.910 --> 34:18.423
SO YOU DO WHAT I SAY
WHEN I SAY IT.

34:18.470 --> 34:20.700
- REALLY? I DO WHATEVER YOU SAY
NO MATTER WHAT?

34:20.740 --> 34:21.729
- YES. NO MATTER WHAT.

34:21.780 --> 34:23.463
- OKAY, SO IF YOU TELL ME
TO SHAVE MY HEAD,

34:23.500 --> 34:24.706
I HAVE TO DO IT?
- YES.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.502
- IF YOU TELL ME TO MURDER
SOMEBODY, THEN I HAVE TO DO IT?

34:26.540 --> 34:28.121
- YES.
KEEP IT COMING. COME ON.

34:28.160 --> 34:29.787
- DAD, IF YOU TELL ME
TO BURN THIS HOUSE DOWN,

34:29.820 --> 34:30.809
THEN I HAVE TO DO THAT?

34:30.860 --> 34:31.645
- YEAH, IF I TELL YOU
TO BURN DOWN THE HOUSE,

34:31.690 --> 34:32.884
YOU HAVE TO
BURN DOWN THE HOUSE.

34:32.930 --> 34:33.783
- DAD!

34:35.410 --> 34:36.786
OKAY.

34:39.660 --> 34:43.892
DAD, MOM TOLD ME THAT I
COULD GO TO STEVE'S HOUSE.

34:43.940 --> 34:46.386
THEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT I HAD TO STAY HOME

34:46.420 --> 34:47.762
AND WATCH MAX
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

34:47.800 --> 34:49.768
AND I DID.
- RIGHT.

34:49.810 --> 34:51.664
- BUT THEN YOU CAME HOME
AND TOLD ME

34:51.710 --> 34:52.836
THAT I COULDN'T
GO TO STEVE'S HOUSE

34:52.880 --> 34:56.668
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T LIKE
THE KIND OF BRA I WAS WEARING.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.818
- I ADMIT THAT
THAT WAS, UH...

35:03.860 --> 35:06.818
INCONSISTENT.

35:06.860 --> 35:08.441
- INCONSISTENT?

35:08.480 --> 35:09.583
- I'M CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU, HADDIE.

35:09.620 --> 35:10.826
- YOU ARE A HYPOCRITE.

35:10.860 --> 35:14.444
YOU WOULD TOTALLY LET DREW
HANG OUT WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

35:14.490 --> 35:17.277
YOU WOULD DRIVE HIM TO HANG OUT
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

35:17.320 --> 35:18.582
BUT BECAUSE I'M A GIRL,

35:18.630 --> 35:24.421
YOU TREAT ME
LIKE I'M 12 YEARS OLD.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.451
- IT'S BECAUSE
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

35:29.470 --> 35:30.539
OKAY?
AND YOU'RE NOT WRONG.

35:30.570 --> 35:33.505
THERE IS A DOUBLE STANDARD.

35:33.540 --> 35:34.507
- YEAH.

35:34.540 --> 35:36.599
- AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

35:36.650 --> 35:37.878
- THANKS.

35:37.920 --> 35:42.755
- BUT THEN AGAIN,
NEITHER IS THE WORLD.

35:42.790 --> 35:44.519
- OKAY, WELL,
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

35:44.550 --> 35:46.654
- THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

36:04.640 --> 36:08.508
- HELLO LAZY MORNING

36:12.540 --> 36:13.814
- MM.

36:13.860 --> 36:16.499
-OH

36:16.550 --> 36:19.587
WHERE COULD THE SUN BE
THIS AFTERNOON

36:19.620 --> 36:21.793
- HEY.

36:21.830 --> 36:23.411
- HEY.

36:23.450 --> 36:28.592
- OH LOOK
WHAT THE SUN DID

36:28.630 --> 36:33.283
IT TURNED A GRAY TO BLUE

36:33.320 --> 36:34.696
- OH, MAN.
IT'S 10:16.

36:34.740 --> 36:35.946
- OH, SO WHAT?

36:35.980 --> 36:37.595
- WELL, I TOLD JULIA

36:37.640 --> 36:40.256
THAT I'D PICK JABBAR UP
AT 10:30.

36:40.300 --> 36:41.631
- WELL, JUST BE
A FEW MINUTES LATE.

36:41.680 --> 36:43.568
- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
JULIA HERE.

36:43.610 --> 36:45.817
YOU KNOW, MY CRAZY SISTER.

36:45.850 --> 36:49.741
SHE'LL USE THIS
AS A TEACHABLE MOMENT.

36:49.790 --> 36:51.473
PROBABLY HOLD JABBAR HOSTAGE

36:51.510 --> 36:53.683
UNTIL I LEARN TO BE PUNCTUAL.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.278
- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T
GO WITH YOU, THEN,

36:55.310 --> 36:58.620
BECAUSE JABBAR WILL WONDER
WHY WE'RE STILL TOGETHER.

36:58.660 --> 36:59.627
- RIGHT.
- YEAH.

36:59.660 --> 37:01.582
- RIGHT. OKAY.

37:01.630 --> 37:03.279
UM, GOOD PLAN.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.288
I WILL GO SUPER FAST,

37:05.320 --> 37:07.697
AND THEN I WILL SEE YOU
IN A FEW MINUTES.

37:07.740 --> 37:09.492
- OKAY.

37:09.530 --> 37:13.773
- THAT WAS, UM,
REALLY FUN LAST NIGHT.

37:13.810 --> 37:16.256
I'LL BE BACK.

37:19.750 --> 37:22.605
- [groans]

37:22.650 --> 37:24.686
- [sighs]

37:24.720 --> 37:26.756
FINE. I DID IT.

37:26.790 --> 37:27.825
I BROKE THE VASE.

37:27.860 --> 37:29.339
ARE YOU HAPPY NOW?

37:29.380 --> 37:30.756
- NO, I'M NOT HAPPY.

37:30.800 --> 37:32.062
- YOU WON, OKAY?
YOU WON.

37:32.110 --> 37:34.340
- SWEETIE, IT'S NOT
ABOUT WINNING AND LOSING.

37:34.390 --> 37:35.345
IT'S ABOUT BEING HONEST.

37:35.390 --> 37:37.529
- YOU WIN. I LOSE.

37:37.560 --> 37:39.243
I'LL GO PICK IT UP.

37:41.120 --> 37:42.838
- OKAY.
- DAD, WHERE'S THE BROOM?

37:42.880 --> 37:45.428
- PANTRY.

37:46.740 --> 37:47.775
- ALL RIGHTY.

37:47.810 --> 37:49.801
- WHO WAS THAT PERSON?

37:49.850 --> 37:52.466
- I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HER
AT ALL.

37:52.510 --> 37:53.295
IT'S FUNNY.

37:53.340 --> 37:54.534
- WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

37:54.580 --> 37:55.535
- [sighs]

37:55.580 --> 37:58.026
- YEAH.

37:58.060 --> 38:00.995
- JOEL.

38:01.030 --> 38:03.749
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

38:13.840 --> 38:16.456
- NO, NO,
I'M NOT FALLING FOR THIS.

38:16.500 --> 38:18.946
YOU DROP THE BERKELEY COLLEGE
CATALOGUE IN FRONT OF ME

38:18.980 --> 38:20.629
AND YOU THINK I'M GONNA
GET ALL EXCITED,

38:20.670 --> 38:22.080
BUT THEN YOU'RE GONNA
BREAK MY HEART

38:22.120 --> 38:23.678
WHEN YOU TELL ME
YOU DECIDED NOT TO APPLY,

38:23.710 --> 38:26.508
SO I SAY...

38:26.540 --> 38:27.700
WHATEVER.

38:27.750 --> 38:28.717
- HUH.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.502
SO FIRST OF ALL,

38:30.540 --> 38:31.984
IT'S NOT REALLY
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY

38:32.030 --> 38:33.782
IF YOU TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

38:33.820 --> 38:34.957
AND, SECOND OF ALL,

38:35.000 --> 38:37.719
IT'S NOT FOR ME.
IT'S FOR YOU.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.729
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:40.760 --> 38:44.764
- I THINK YOU
SHOULD APPLY TO BERKELEY.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.689
- WHAT?

38:47.730 --> 38:49.357
- WELL, WHY NOT?

38:49.390 --> 38:50.527
I MEAN, IF JIM KAZINSKY

38:50.560 --> 38:53.120
CAN GET PEOPLE ALL HOT
AND BOTHERED ABOUT HIS POETRY,

38:53.150 --> 38:56.529
THEN ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE,
RIGHT?

38:56.570 --> 38:59.539
JUST DON'T GIVE UP
ON YOURSELF EITHER, OKAY?

38:59.570 --> 39:03.916
- IT TOOK TOO LONG
TO SEE

39:03.960 --> 39:07.054
I WAS WRONG TO BELIEVE

39:07.100 --> 39:09.682
IN ME ONLY

39:13.900 --> 39:15.037
- HI THERE.

39:15.070 --> 39:16.037
- HEY.

39:16.070 --> 39:18.004
- HEY.
WHAT YA READING?

39:18.040 --> 39:20.793
I READ THAT ONE.

39:20.840 --> 39:24.697
- HOW'S THE, UH, ADJUSTMENT BACK
INTO FAMILY LIFE TREATING YOU?

39:24.740 --> 39:25.968
- IT'S GOOD.
- YEAH?

39:26.010 --> 39:27.591
- YUP.
I MISSED YOU.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.595
- I MISSED YOU TOO.

39:28.640 --> 39:29.777
- A LOT.

39:29.810 --> 39:31.732
- MM.

39:31.780 --> 39:34.601
- SO, UM...
- YEAH?

39:34.640 --> 39:37.712
- DENISE WANTS ME TO COME
WITH HER TO L.A. NEXT WEEK

39:37.750 --> 39:38.819
FOR A COUPLE OF FUNDRAISERS.

39:38.850 --> 39:40.408
- OH. OKAY.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.919
- YEAH.
- THAT'S COOL.

39:41.960 --> 39:43.689
- SHE ALSO OFFERED ME
A FULL-TIME JOB

39:43.720 --> 39:47.781
AS HER
COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR.

39:47.830 --> 39:49.752
- UH, CONGRATULATIONS.
THAT'S GREAT.

39:49.800 --> 39:52.485
UM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.078
- WELL, I TOLD HER
THAT I WOULD THINK ABOUT IT,

39:54.110 --> 39:55.793
AND I WOULD TALK TO YOU.

39:55.840 --> 39:59.139
- SO YOU WANT TO DO IT?

39:59.180 --> 40:02.525
- KIND OF.
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

40:02.570 --> 40:04.219
I MEAN, HONEY,
I--I LOVE OUR KIDS,

40:04.260 --> 40:06.569
AND I LOVE YOU
AND I LOVE BEING A MOM.

40:06.610 --> 40:07.918
I LOVE ALL OF THAT.

40:07.950 --> 40:09.770
BUT, HONESTLY,
WHEN I WAS THERE,

40:09.820 --> 40:12.914
I FELT SO--
I FELT SO ALIVE,

40:12.960 --> 40:15.053
AND--AND IT WAS
JUST AMAZING.

40:15.100 --> 40:16.681
IT WAS LIKE
I WAS BEING SEEN

40:16.720 --> 40:18.028
FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN SO LONG, YOU KNOW?

40:18.070 --> 40:21.471
- I GET IT.
I GET IT.

40:21.520 --> 40:22.305
OKAY?

40:22.350 --> 40:23.851
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I SEE YOU.

40:23.900 --> 40:24.867
- I KNOW.

40:24.900 --> 40:25.821
I KNOW YOU DO.

40:25.870 --> 40:28.589
BUT YOU--YOU SEE ME
IN A DIFFERENT WAY.

40:28.630 --> 40:31.724
- I KNOW.

40:31.770 --> 40:32.737
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT?

40:32.770 --> 40:33.976
- SO WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

40:34.010 --> 40:35.216
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

40:35.260 --> 40:37.774
UM, YOU KNOW,

40:37.810 --> 40:39.084
I'LL NEED SOME HELP HERE
AT THE HOUSE,

40:39.120 --> 40:41.634
AND I'LL, UH--
I'LL CALL MY MOM.

40:41.680 --> 40:42.749
YOU KNOW,
I THINK THAT SHE'LL BE UP

40:42.780 --> 40:44.259
FOR STAYING HERE
A COUPLE NIGHTS A WEEK.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.643
AND YOU KNOW, I NEED TO GET
SOMEBODY ON THE HOOK

40:46.680 --> 40:49.478
TO MAKE SURE MAX
MAKES IT TO ALL HIS THERAPIES

40:49.510 --> 40:51.478
AND HADDIE GETS TO ALL
HER SPORTING EVENTS, BUT,

40:51.510 --> 40:53.751
UM, YOU KNOW, AND I CAN ALSO
COME HOME FROM WORK EARLY

40:53.790 --> 40:54.757
ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK,

40:54.790 --> 40:56.269
AND I CAN START TO,
YOU KNOW,

40:56.310 --> 40:57.857
WORK MORE FROM HOME
IN THE MORNING.

40:57.900 --> 40:58.889
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

40:58.930 --> 41:01.000
GET SOME GROCERIES DELIVERED.
FIGURE IT OUT.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.725
- YEAH.
NO, YOU KNOW--

41:03.770 --> 41:04.998
- WHAT?

41:05.040 --> 41:08.999
- HONEY, UM,
THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME.

41:09.050 --> 41:11.189
I--I'M NOT GONNA DO IT.
- KRISTINA.

41:11.220 --> 41:13.529
- THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT TIME.
MAX AND HADDIE NEED ME HERE.

41:13.570 --> 41:14.844
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

41:14.880 --> 41:16.632
- KRISTINA...
- NO, NO.

41:16.680 --> 41:17.601
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LOOK BACK ON THIS

41:17.640 --> 41:18.914
AND FEEL LIKE YOU
MISSED OUT ON SOMETHING.

41:18.950 --> 41:20.815
- I WON'T, I WON'T.

41:20.850 --> 41:22.784
UH, THIS IS A NO-BRAINER,
YOU KNOW?

41:22.820 --> 41:24.788
I MEAN,
THERE'LL BE OTHER CAMPAIGNS,

41:24.820 --> 41:30.611
AND OUR KIDS ARE ONLY
GONNA BE KIDS FOR SO LONG.

41:30.660 --> 41:31.649
AND I CAN DO IT LATER.

41:31.690 --> 41:35.205
- AND IT AIN'T ABOUT
LOSING YOUR MIND

41:35.250 --> 41:37.002
- ARE YOU SURE?

41:37.040 --> 41:39.008
- YES, I'M SURE.

41:39.040 --> 41:41.736
- BUT IF YOU HAPPEN TO
THAT'S FINE

41:41.770 --> 41:44.876
- ALL RIGHT. WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THIS MEETING?

41:44.910 --> 41:46.969
- UM, IT WAS AWESOME.

41:47.020 --> 41:47.975
IT WAS SO COOL.

41:48.020 --> 41:49.738
I MEAN, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO PROUD OF ME.

41:49.780 --> 41:51.839
I, UM...

41:51.880 --> 41:53.814
I WAS AWESOME.

41:53.850 --> 41:55.078
I WAS AWESOME.

41:55.130 --> 41:56.643
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.886
I WAS JUST--
I WAS IN MY ELEMENT.

41:57.920 --> 42:00.309
- FREELY, FREELY

42:00.340 --> 42:04.276
MEU CORACAO

42:04.310 --> 42:07.689
FREELY, FREELY

42:07.730 --> 42:10.893
