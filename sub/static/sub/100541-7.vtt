WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.604
We are Nadja and Laszlo,
the human music group.

00:03.704 --> 00:05.273
She's a superb lyricist.

00:05.373 --> 00:10.944
* We're feeling horny for blood
We're feeling horny for love *

00:11.045 --> 00:13.013
(up-tempo music plays)

00:14.748 --> 00:15.749
VOCALISTS: Hey!

00:22.022 --> 00:23.591
*

00:26.860 --> 00:29.430
When the last time
you told your-your homeboys

00:29.463 --> 00:30.898
that you love them and you
appreciate them and value them?

00:30.931 --> 00:33.501
-EMMA: No...
-(indistinct chatter on video)

00:33.534 --> 00:35.803
-Mm.
-Turn that shit off.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.939
I'm sorry.
Just go back to sleep.

00:38.972 --> 00:40.541
(Emma groans)

00:40.574 --> 00:43.577
Did I get curb-stomped
last night?

00:43.611 --> 00:48.916
I feel like my brain cells have
been removed from my head and...

00:48.949 --> 00:50.718
Neither of those.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.287
...put together randomly.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.955
(Elz chuckles)

00:54.988 --> 00:56.890
There was this little dude
named "Tequila,"

00:56.924 --> 00:59.927
and he came around,
and you lost that fight.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.529
(Elz chuckles)

01:01.562 --> 01:02.996
-You're an idiot.
-(laughs)

01:05.799 --> 01:07.368
(Emma grunts softly)

01:07.401 --> 01:08.869
(squeaking)

01:08.902 --> 01:10.804
(Elz laughs)

01:10.838 --> 01:12.440
What the...?

01:12.473 --> 01:14.775
Whoa. Are you trying
to smoke my USB right now?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.377
(laughs)

01:16.410 --> 01:18.746
Oh, my God.

01:20.114 --> 01:22.616
Just properly eject
next time, please?

01:22.650 --> 01:24.652
-(chuckling)
-(inhaling)

01:27.455 --> 01:30.458
(coughing)

01:30.491 --> 01:32.560
See, that's what you get,
Chernobyl.

01:32.593 --> 01:33.794
(coughing)

01:33.827 --> 01:35.829
ELZ:
It's gonna kill you and me.

01:38.999 --> 01:41.769
What?
Stop looking at me like that.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.638
Ow.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.441
Do you want water or anything?

01:47.475 --> 01:48.942
No, I'm good.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.644
-You want a hug?
-No.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.113
-A high five?
-Can you just stop talking?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.451
What the fuck happened to...?

01:57.485 --> 01:59.187
(sniffs)
Ugh.

01:59.220 --> 02:01.289
-Oh, my...
-Can I borrow a shirt?

02:01.322 --> 02:03.491
Yeah, but you look like
a victim right now.

02:03.524 --> 02:04.992
I'm kidding.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.960
Let's see what we have here.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.898
(drawer opens)

02:13.367 --> 02:14.968
Boom.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.670
No.

02:16.704 --> 02:18.105
You wear that all the time.

02:18.138 --> 02:20.174
Everyone's gonna know
it's your shirt.

02:22.910 --> 02:27.715
Well, haters gonna hate,
so you get...

02:27.748 --> 02:29.217
(chuckling):
a P.E. shirt.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.453
How's it feel...

02:32.486 --> 02:35.022
* To be with me? *

02:35.055 --> 02:38.359
-(snaps fingers)
-You're so weird.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.793
Don't overreact
and shit like that.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.395
I hold the door for everybody,
girl.

02:41.429 --> 02:43.063
My mom raised a gentleman.

02:43.096 --> 02:46.467
You're so overly dramatic.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.702
Uh... what are you about to do?

02:52.172 --> 02:56.410
No plans.
Just gonna continue being alive.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.246
Yeah.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.681
I got a meeting in a second.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.150
I should probably, like,
shower or something,

03:03.183 --> 03:07.087
so I don't smell like tequila
and ass when I get there, huh?

03:07.120 --> 03:11.259
Well, appreciate the, uh,
hospitality.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.361
Is that what you do to everybody
after you have sex? You just

03:13.394 --> 03:15.729
-punch them twice?
-Bye.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.733
Fuck!

03:19.767 --> 03:21.735
(touch tones sounding)

03:21.769 --> 03:23.571
-(phone ringing through)
-(scoffs)

03:25.906 --> 03:27.241
Yeah, I think
somebody broke into your car.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.042
WOMAN:
911. Where is your emergency?

03:29.076 --> 03:31.044
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* I'm Lil Dicky *

03:31.078 --> 03:32.680
-* Hi, I'm Dave *
-* Who's Dave? *

03:32.713 --> 03:34.682
* Hi, I'm Dave. *

03:34.715 --> 03:36.384
Correct me if I'm wrong.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.420
You usually call 911
when, like-- I don't know--

03:39.453 --> 03:41.622
you're being currently stabbed
in the chest or something,

03:41.655 --> 03:43.624
not when someone broke
into your car.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.793
Well, my day just got stabbed
in the chest.

03:45.826 --> 03:49.397
Now I got to deal with the cops,
and then... oh, insurance

03:49.430 --> 03:51.098
and all that shit.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.767
And hope that my work is saved
on the cloud.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.436
Don't call the cops
while I'm sitting next to you,

03:55.469 --> 03:56.970
'cause then I'm under arrest,

03:57.004 --> 03:59.473
'cause I apparently broke
into your car.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.108
-(chuckles)
-And then I'm in handcuffs,

04:01.141 --> 04:04.545
and then you have no T-shirt,
no dick, no laptop.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.447
I'm good on the T-shirt
and the dicks,

04:06.480 --> 04:08.115
but you're right
about the cops.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.817
They're just gonna make me
file a report,

04:09.850 --> 04:11.752
and then go back
to beating up poor people.

04:11.785 --> 04:13.754
(both chuckle softly)

04:13.787 --> 04:15.556
You don't have
to stay here with me.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.257
All right, nigga.
See you later.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.060
(laughs)

04:20.093 --> 04:22.262
-Could you imagine?
-Wow.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.598
Ooh, is that a roly-poly?

04:24.632 --> 04:28.235
Well, yeah, I couldn't leave you
looking homeless.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.803
This is your shirt.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.907
-(phone chimes)
-(Elz sighs)

04:33.941 --> 04:36.910
Mm-hmm.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.579
(music plays over phone)

04:38.612 --> 04:42.450
Bro, every fucking time!

04:42.483 --> 04:44.418
What's up?

04:44.452 --> 04:47.755
This is my beat, and some
SoundCloud rapper just stole it

04:47.788 --> 04:49.757
and recorded
his lame-ass verse to it

04:49.790 --> 04:51.191
and didn't give me any credit.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.194
Let's take the beat
and kill his mom to it.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.697
It's just, like... why am
I still dealing with this shit?

04:56.730 --> 04:59.266
Like, how fucking old am I?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.701
Do you know what it feels like

05:00.734 --> 05:02.536
to just have your work stolen
from under you?

05:02.570 --> 05:05.739
No fucking clue.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.378
Now I'm about to DJ

05:10.411 --> 05:12.446
this fucking silent disco
tonight like a creep.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.448
I just be sitting in sessions
with Trippie

05:14.482 --> 05:16.517
for, like, 12 fucking hours,
not playing any beats

05:16.550 --> 05:18.318
on my hard drive
'cause I'm scared.

05:18.352 --> 05:21.889
But like, bro, I want to be
a fucking producer, you know?

05:21.922 --> 05:24.492
If you want to be
an actual producer, show him.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.694
Have you met this kid?
He's so intimidating.

05:26.727 --> 05:29.497
There's an "eight" in the middle
of his fucking face, like...

05:29.530 --> 05:31.298
like a fucking calculator
or something, brah.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.833
That shit is nerve-racking.

05:32.866 --> 05:35.068
Speaking of,
when's your meeting?

05:35.102 --> 05:37.538
Um...

05:37.571 --> 05:39.306
Uh...

05:39.339 --> 05:42.042
it's not really important.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.411
They don't need me
every second of it.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.978
(sighs)
You don't have to do that.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.881
-Do what?
-Treat me like a fucking random.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.384
You don't have to make up
a meeting just to get rid of me.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.386
Oh, make up a meeting?

05:52.420 --> 05:54.354
I didn't make up a meeting.

05:54.388 --> 05:56.356
I just... You know, it was...

05:56.390 --> 05:58.358
Today is...

05:58.392 --> 06:00.428
a day, and tomorrow's
another day, and...

06:00.461 --> 06:03.564
Look, we were friends before
whatever happened last night,

06:03.597 --> 06:06.867
so you don't get
to act different now.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.771
You're not gonna say "bye,"
give me a hug, nothing?

06:10.804 --> 06:13.273
-Get off my car.
-Or else what?

06:13.306 --> 06:15.543
I'll run you over.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.244
Really?
You're gonna run me over?

06:17.277 --> 06:19.780
Wait, wait. Before you start
your car, can you hear me?

06:19.813 --> 06:21.449
-Huh?
-It's a joke.
Your window's broken.

06:21.482 --> 06:23.350
-(laughs)
-(car starts)

06:23.383 --> 06:25.686
-Get out of the way.
-You're not gonna do shit.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.755
-(engine revs, horn toots)
-Really?!

06:27.788 --> 06:29.923
-EMMA: Bye.
-Hey!

06:29.957 --> 06:32.593
You left your vape!
You left your vape!

06:37.765 --> 06:39.467
Yo, so I got this crazy idea
for a music video, right?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.368
So it looks like you're walking
down a nail polish aisle.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.270
It's just, like,
a bunch of rows of bottles

06:43.303 --> 06:45.573
of nail polish
in order of flesh tone.

06:45.606 --> 06:47.541
But then you zoom in,

06:47.575 --> 06:49.309
and it's just a bunch
of naked-ass dudes

06:49.342 --> 06:50.978
organized by, like,
every race-- light skin,

06:51.011 --> 06:54.615
dark skin, brown skin,
every tone. Crazy, right?

06:54.648 --> 06:56.283
Well, let me hit you back
when I leave the studio.

06:56.316 --> 06:59.252
All right.

06:59.286 --> 07:01.555
You want to be in a music video?

07:01.589 --> 07:03.957
I... don't really think
that's my thing.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.659
I don't have the chest for that.

07:05.693 --> 07:08.095
-But you want some coffee?
-I'll do the coffee,

07:08.128 --> 07:09.797
but I don't fuck with milk.

07:09.830 --> 07:12.265
Out of respect for cows?

07:12.299 --> 07:14.001
Out of respect for the titties.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.003
-Well, this is pea milk
from a pea.
-(phone ringing)

07:16.036 --> 07:18.405
There's literally
not one titty involved, so,

07:18.438 --> 07:19.940
-I guess you could kind of...
-Hold that thought, pea milk.

07:19.973 --> 07:22.610
Yo, this dude is, like, punking
out, asked to be in my video.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.411
(mimicking):
Punking out.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.446
Yeah, see, they got
all the candy in here, so...

07:26.480 --> 07:29.316
I'm gonna take you to where all
the candy is. (mumbles)

07:29.349 --> 07:30.784
Oh, man.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.420
-What's up, man? How are you?
-What's going down?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.589
Chill... chillin'.

07:35.623 --> 07:36.957
-Right.
-Um, are you gonna

07:36.990 --> 07:38.992
record later or anything, or...?

07:39.026 --> 07:40.427
-Yeah, I'm-a be in there.
-All right, cool, 'cause I

07:40.460 --> 07:41.929
wanted to load up
some beats for you.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.931
-If you have any time...
-Look-look-look, before that,

07:43.964 --> 07:45.165
uh, can you do me a favor?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.834
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, look,

07:46.867 --> 07:48.802
this is my nephew Sauron.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.203
Hey, Sauron. I'm Elz.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.605
Hi, Elz.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.440
That's a cool chain you got.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.509
-Are those diamonds?
-Yes.

07:55.543 --> 07:58.378
So, look, I was supposed to
take him shopping, but I can't

07:58.411 --> 07:59.813
'cause I got to go do
this music video,

07:59.847 --> 08:02.015
and it ain't the right
surrounding for a little bro,

08:02.049 --> 08:04.985
so I need you to go
take him shopping for me.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.219
-Take him shopping?
-Yeah, like,

08:06.253 --> 08:08.021
take him to Beverly Hills, yeah.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.657
Sir, I don't think
you understand.

08:09.690 --> 08:12.793
Bro, I don't have any money.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.695
Like, I work here.
I'm a normal dude.

08:14.728 --> 08:17.130
I got money.
Sauron, how much money you need?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.465
This much.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.167
All right, I got you.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.969
That's a...
awful lot of money

08:22.002 --> 08:24.738
to hand a child.
How old is he?

08:24.772 --> 08:26.006
Now, what do we do?

08:26.039 --> 08:28.676
-Share.
-We share.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.377
I'll see you later, Sauron.

08:30.410 --> 08:33.213
-All right, dude,
I appreciate it.
-Uh...

08:33.246 --> 08:35.482
uh, man...
I feel like one of these people

08:35.515 --> 08:38.085
he might be
more comfortable with.

08:39.787 --> 08:41.154
(mumbles)

08:41.188 --> 08:43.090
(sighs)
What do I...

08:43.123 --> 08:46.159
Do you need to eat food?
Do you eat?

08:46.193 --> 08:48.028
Yes.

08:48.061 --> 08:50.197
What a treat this is.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.699
His face is...

08:51.732 --> 08:53.366
I love him.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.069
Let me ask you this,
and forgive my ignorance, but...

08:56.103 --> 08:58.906
do most engineers that
are trying to become producers

08:58.939 --> 09:00.540
take the babysitting route?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.542
You know, I'm sure Dr. Dre
at one point in time

09:02.576 --> 09:04.077
-had to babysit someone.
-He babysat? Yeah. I...

09:04.111 --> 09:06.079
This is not my industry.
I mean, it's my industry,

09:06.113 --> 09:08.749
but it's not my,
like, you know, my niche.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.250
Yeah. What is your niche,
rapping?

09:10.283 --> 09:11.752
Ooh, hard to put your finger

09:11.785 --> 09:14.221
on what my niche is. I'm very,
like, multidimensional.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.690
You know, I do rap-- you saw me
go viral with, like, a stunt

09:16.724 --> 09:18.592
where I impacted
the entire culture of America.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.127
Yeah, for a bunch
of middle school kids.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.461
-Whoop-de-doo.
-The way I see it,

09:21.494 --> 09:23.797
you-you've kind of entered this,
like, wormhole

09:23.831 --> 09:26.299
that reverses your trajectory
and, like, your career

09:26.333 --> 09:28.401
borderline
has Benjamin Button's disease,

09:28.435 --> 09:31.271
-Interesting. Okay.
-'cause you
just keep going backwards.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.874
Your career could have any sort
of disease you want it to have,

09:33.907 --> 09:35.542
because I can take half of it.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.977
-How?
-Do you real...

09:37.010 --> 09:39.446
I own half of your stuff,
'cause I make the beats.

09:39.479 --> 09:40.748
-Okay.
-Therefore...

09:40.781 --> 09:42.582
-Right.
-really, you're waiting on me

09:42.616 --> 09:44.284
to make everything happen,
Captain.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.953
You're right. I'm sorry.
It's just guys being guy...

09:45.986 --> 09:48.221
But you know what,
you need a producer tag.

09:48.255 --> 09:51.258
-No.'Cause producer tags
are so corny, though.
-Yeah, that... They are corny,

09:51.291 --> 09:53.260
but yours can be cool...er
than most, and also,

09:53.293 --> 09:54.895
the-the reason that they exist

09:54.928 --> 09:56.563
is so people don't just, like,
run away with the beat.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.931
Look, let's make one right now.

09:57.965 --> 10:00.000
Voice memo up, and...

10:00.033 --> 10:01.001
* Elz!

10:01.034 --> 10:02.469
* No...!

10:02.502 --> 10:04.104
* Don't take it!

10:04.137 --> 10:05.105
Just playing with you.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.573
I'll give you a good one.
Hold on.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.176
* Elz, please
don't steal my beat *

10:09.209 --> 10:10.610
-* Or Elz.
-See? No.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.080
I think-- You know what it
has to be? A female's voice.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.982
I can do f...
Okay, that's easy.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.250
(feminine voice): * Elz, I know
how to use the software well *

10:17.284 --> 10:18.819
* But I don't know
how to navigate *

10:18.852 --> 10:19.987
* This industry socially.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.488
-Sexy Latin woman.
-That's fine. Easy.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.023
'Cause everything you say
right now sounds like shit.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.758
Sexy Latin.
I got that, too. Okay.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.260
* Ooh, Elz, papito,
how did you make it *

10:27.294 --> 10:30.363
* With the software in time
in between fucking me so good? *

10:30.397 --> 10:32.599
Enough. You're too satisfied
with my misfortunes.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.967
It's just guys being guys.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.003
You're not a guy,
you're a dick.

10:36.036 --> 10:39.973
I can't believe Trippie
entrusted you with this child.

10:40.007 --> 10:41.975
Bro, I can't believe it, either.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.111
Think about it.
He has, like, a heartbeat.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.512
-Yeah.
-Beats.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.514
It's not, like,
his session files.

10:47.547 --> 10:48.782
-You know, this is a...
-Bro, vocals,

10:48.816 --> 10:50.017
I'm fine with stuff
like that, yeah.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.485
Realistically,
would you rather lose this child

10:52.519 --> 10:54.955
or lose all
of his session files?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.991
I don't want to contemplate
either of those options.

10:58.025 --> 10:59.359
They both sound terrifying.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.694
Are these wooden shirts?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.663
Yep.

11:03.697 --> 11:06.366
All these shirts are 100% wood.

11:06.399 --> 11:08.235
-(chuckles)
-What a concept.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.637
I have never heard of this.
This is very innovative.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.039
Are these things
flying off the shelves?

11:12.072 --> 11:14.007
Uh, yeah, not quite flying.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.643
Have you ever been
on Shark Tank or anything?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.345
What's that?

11:18.378 --> 11:19.913
It's a TV show.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.882
Oh, I-I just reentered society.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.717
I want one.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.585
-The wooden shirt?
-By all means, man.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.220
You got ten grand.

11:27.254 --> 11:28.521
Try one on, man.

11:28.555 --> 11:30.490
-Want to try this one on, buddy?
-Yeah.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.225
-Are these splinter-free?
-Splinter-free.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.062
Took a year to figure that out.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.696
Where do you wear these? Like...

11:36.730 --> 11:38.065
socially, like, how does it...

11:38.098 --> 11:39.933
Yeah, anywhere you'd wear
a normal shirt.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.668
-Hunting...
-I hope you don't have
any woodpeckers

11:41.701 --> 11:44.237
in your neighborhood.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.239
I don't mean that, like...

11:46.273 --> 11:47.775
molestually, or...

11:47.808 --> 11:50.377
Yo, this is hard.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.245
You look like
Pinocchio took steroids.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.948
DAVE: You look like if they made
a new Pinocchio movie, you know,

11:54.982 --> 11:59.019
today with all the progressive
racial casting in mind.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.888
-(Elz laughs)
-Can you even, like,
run around in it or anything?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.923
-Like, do you have mobility?
-Yeah.

12:02.956 --> 12:05.225
Oh, wow!

12:05.258 --> 12:07.694
-ELZ: Yeah.
-You're like Barry Sanders
right now.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.462
-Look at you.
-You're, like,
the first wheel ever.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.064
You're like Muhammad Ali.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.700
-Oh! Sauron!
-Oh! Oh, my lord.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.435
Don't... It's gonna scrape.
You can't... It's gonna scrape.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.437
-SAURON: I can't get up.
-Uh, can you roll over?

12:17.470 --> 12:19.106
-SAURON: No.
-Aah, he can't even...

12:19.139 --> 12:21.074
-He's, like, a... What do y...
-ELZ: Aah!

12:21.108 --> 12:22.575
-One, two, three, lift.
-(yelling)

12:22.609 --> 12:24.411
Oh, my lord!

12:24.444 --> 12:25.578
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

12:25.612 --> 12:27.047
-Oh.
-You're buying? Oh, my God.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.716
-DAVE: Thank God this is hard.
-ELZ: Jesus.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.951
You got any socks?

12:35.622 --> 12:37.457
Hey, this your boy Kid Toilet
here to drop my new single.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.758
-The beat is fire on it.
-ELZ: Fucking thief.

12:38.792 --> 12:40.560
It's called "Pops,
Percs, Oxys and Xannies."

12:40.593 --> 12:43.430
If your pops like me right now,
drop a comment below.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.799
-Kid Toilet. Flush with pride.
-(knocking)

12:45.833 --> 12:48.435
-What's up?
-What's up, buttercup?

12:48.468 --> 12:50.570
Wow.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.073
-Fancy.
-Little bit.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.607
How are you?

12:54.641 --> 12:57.277
Eh, been better.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.812
Wait a second.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.248
Oh, hell yes.

13:01.281 --> 13:04.084
Just you know, all this other
equipment, it's un-smokable.

13:04.117 --> 13:06.319
Just fair warning,
just in case you try

13:06.353 --> 13:08.655
to pick anything up randomly
and hit it.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.190
Wow. You're funny.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.193
What's going on
with your laptop, kiddo?

13:13.226 --> 13:14.794
(groans)
Investigation's ongoing.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.763
But you know what?
I may start stealing laptops,

13:16.796 --> 13:18.765
because apparently
there's no consequences for it.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.133
Unless I, uh...

13:21.902 --> 13:23.837
(whispers):
...I turn you in.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.873
I knew you were a rat.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.807
What am I gonna do with you?

13:27.841 --> 13:30.543
-Stand up 69 where I hold you?
-(laughs)

13:30.577 --> 13:32.312
-Dude, let's do it.
-Hey, punch me in.

13:32.345 --> 13:34.181
I'm about to go crazy, bruh.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.615
Let me get a session, man.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.984
I'm trying to go Einstein
in the booth.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.219
Me and him could be making
classics right now.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.154
-Oh.
-Come on, man.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.023
We supposed to be making hits.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.058
Um, I'm gonna leave you guys.

13:45.092 --> 13:46.659
Hold on. You stay here.
Don't you got the plug

13:46.693 --> 13:48.996
on the stick and dot tattoos
and the poke and shit?

13:49.029 --> 13:51.364
Like, I'm trying to get tatted,
like, blasted for real.

13:51.398 --> 13:54.734
-At my place, yeah.
So what are you thinking?
-Man, I'm thinking about,

13:54.767 --> 13:58.538
you know, Maserati, me in the
back with two Chinese joints,

13:58.571 --> 14:00.673
you know, like,
you can see through the windows,

14:00.707 --> 14:03.911
me just getting head, watching
a documentary about some...

14:03.944 --> 14:05.478
Fijian chicks, like, you know,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.480
TVs in the headrest,
all of that, just chilling,

14:07.514 --> 14:08.681
real boss shit.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.283
What kind of Maserati?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.754
I know y'all smashin'.

14:14.787 --> 14:17.557
(snickers)
What?

14:17.590 --> 14:19.492
I know y'all smashin'.
Look at y'all.

14:19.526 --> 14:20.827
Y'all just in here vibing, like,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.395
the computer
ain't even doing nothing

14:22.429 --> 14:24.497
about music,
it's just sitting there.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.466
Ugh. I'd rather die.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.670
GATA:
On that note,

14:30.703 --> 14:32.605
I'm-a bounce, 'cause I got
a baddy at the house

14:32.639 --> 14:35.408
waiting on me, bruh.
I'm gone, Kong.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.810
(chuckles)

14:39.947 --> 14:41.781
Hey.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.116
Let me get in that booth.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.751
Let me make some classics.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.453
Whatever.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.756
Oh, shit.

14:49.789 --> 14:53.260
I just remembered
all my nudes are on that laptop.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.395
Guess I got to retake 'em.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.897
I guess so.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.100
Wow.

15:00.133 --> 15:02.135
You're fun.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.239
All of a sudden
you want me to be fun?

15:06.273 --> 15:09.977
Like, every time I do something
for you, it's too much.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.279
If I give you a T-shirt,
it's too Elz of a T-shirt.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.781
If I open the door for you,
it's too nice

15:14.814 --> 15:16.749
for me to do that.
I just don't know

15:16.783 --> 15:18.585
what you want from me,
and I'm following your lead,

15:18.618 --> 15:20.420
and you're just
all over the place.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.455
See, this is exactly why
we shouldn't have had sex.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.657
You're acting like an emo bitch.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.095
Emo bitch.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.597
Got you.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.501
Good one.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.939
(Emma sighs)

15:44.811 --> 15:46.446
(sighs heavily)

15:46.479 --> 15:48.481
(instrumental music plays,
featuring synthesizer)

15:50.450 --> 15:52.285
TRIPPIE:
Oh, man, what's this?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.121
Oh.

15:54.154 --> 15:55.922
Um... this is a-a beat I...

15:55.955 --> 15:57.824
Uh, nigga,
this is a beat I made.

15:57.857 --> 15:59.526
Vibe hard. Run that shit
back a little bit?

15:59.559 --> 16:01.461
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

16:02.529 --> 16:03.997
That shit crazy.

16:04.031 --> 16:05.798
I j... I just be making beats
all the time.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.767
I got hella beats just in case
you ever need any, you know?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.802
Yeah, I need this one.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.539
Yeah, I'll, uh...

16:12.572 --> 16:14.674
I'll-I'll-I'll save it
for you or whatever.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.309
Who you was holding this for--
Thug?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.545
-Young Thug?
-Yeah.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.213
Who do you think I am?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.449
Bro, I am normal, nigga.
I Uber.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.284
For real?

16:24.317 --> 16:25.785
No, I drive Uber.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.987
How come
you ain't tell me about this?

16:28.021 --> 16:29.556
I mean, I don't want
to overstep my boundaries.

16:29.589 --> 16:31.291
I'm sure, like, a bunch
of people come to you like,

16:31.324 --> 16:32.692
"Yo, I got a beat for you,"

16:32.725 --> 16:34.061
"Yo, let me rap for you,"
so it's, like...

16:34.094 --> 16:35.662
I mean, but you're understeppin'

16:35.695 --> 16:38.165
'cause you're not trying
to show somebody that work.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.067
I feel you. I just be scared.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.901
I don't want to be weird.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.637
Damn! Oh, sick.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.373
This is my new favorite shirt.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.242
That's like some 300 shit.
Give...

16:49.276 --> 16:50.643
Give me a high five, man.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.545
You know, I... I picked
that shit out for him.

16:52.579 --> 16:53.980
For real? That's like some

16:54.013 --> 16:57.217
"This is Sparta!"
looking-ass shit.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.687
You know what I'm saying?
It's that, "Yeah!" (chuckles)

17:00.720 --> 17:04.457
Yeah, like,
"Are you not entertained?!"

17:06.559 --> 17:08.395
Yeah...

17:08.428 --> 17:09.829
Okay.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.531
Maybe not?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.166
-* Ready! *
-* Let's go *

17:13.200 --> 17:15.202
* Hittaz on deck, hittaz
on deck, hittaz on deck *

17:15.235 --> 17:19.072
* I'm 17, got that bad ho
stay on my... *

17:19.106 --> 17:21.174
Hey, can you play
"Party in the U.S.A."?

17:21.208 --> 17:25.512
I-I actually would rather
just pull all my teeth out,

17:25.545 --> 17:28.115
try to eat a steak, maybe.

17:28.148 --> 17:29.882
Excuse me?
I work for the sponsor,

17:29.916 --> 17:31.618
if you're interested
in keeping this gig.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.420
(Valley girl voice):
Oh, my God. That's so crazy.

17:33.453 --> 17:34.854
What am I gonna do if I don't

17:34.887 --> 17:36.289
-keep this fucking gig?
-Screw you.

17:36.323 --> 17:38.057
How am I gonna eat tonight,
lady?!

17:38.091 --> 17:39.626
(chuckles)

17:39.659 --> 17:41.628
* I ain't never seen you
with a gun... *

17:41.661 --> 17:44.097
-L.A., open up that fucking pit!
-* Hop out with choppas *

17:44.131 --> 17:45.932
* Young niggas shottas,

17:45.965 --> 17:48.601
Oh, none of you guys
can fucking hear me.

17:50.270 --> 17:53.740
Hey, you know what the fuck
it is. You're a loser. Ha!

17:53.773 --> 17:55.775
That's my fucking loser.
That's my guy right there.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.911
If you or a loved one was
diagnosed with mesothelioma,

17:58.945 --> 18:00.647
you can collect money
or some shit!

18:00.680 --> 18:02.582
She's cheating on you, dawg.
You know.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.917
You're cheating on that nigga.
Yeah.

18:04.951 --> 18:07.720
What's up, white people?!
Yeah, you're fucking trash.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.257
High five if you love
black people. Fuck, yeah.

18:10.290 --> 18:12.725
High five if you don't love
black people. You're crazy.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.496
-Hey, can I make a request?
-Oh. (laughs)

18:16.529 --> 18:20.333
Um, only if it's "Get The Fuck
Out My Face" by Rich Homie Quan.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.469
How about "Don't Be Lame.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.405
"I Came All The Way Here in Rush
Hour to This Nightmare Event

18:25.438 --> 18:27.907
With No Passenger Side Window
to See Your Dumb Ass."

18:27.940 --> 18:29.676
It's my jam.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.011
(Elz laughs softly)

18:32.044 --> 18:34.080
Like, why was I mad
at you again?

18:34.113 --> 18:35.515
I really can't remember.

18:35.548 --> 18:38.084
Uh... I don't know.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.587
Well, I'll just accept this
as an apology.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.356
This is not an apology.
I didn't come here to apologize.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.791
Oh, so you came here

18:44.824 --> 18:46.293
(in baby voice):
'cause you missed me?

18:46.326 --> 18:47.694
You couldn't live without me?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.962
(chuckles softly)
Maybe.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.031
Maybe you couldn't live
without me?

18:52.064 --> 18:53.833
-Uh...
-We should have fucked.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.768
I'm happy we fucked.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.205
Obvious fucking-ly,
I'm happy we fucked, too. Yeah.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.939
Obviously fucking-ly.

18:59.972 --> 19:03.810
I just don't want our friends
to find out yet, so...

19:03.843 --> 19:05.378
I mean, dude,
the last thing I want in life

19:05.412 --> 19:06.879
is Dave giving me
fucking relationship advice,

19:06.913 --> 19:08.515
so trust me, I understand.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.618
Do you think I want Ally
to give me relationship advice?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.386
You think I want fuckin' Ally
to give me relationship advice?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.955
-Jesus Christ.
-No. So we're good.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.191
You're a crazy person,
you know that?

19:18.225 --> 19:20.193
I take that as a compliment.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.628
-(indistinct chatter)
-MAN: Hey.
-MAN 2: What's up, man?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.831
Oh, shit.
The music stopped. Um...

19:24.864 --> 19:26.466
EMMA:
Oh, shit.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.068
If you're here for the silent
disco, make some noise!

19:29.101 --> 19:30.637
-MAN: Yeah.
-MAN 3: Play it, man.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.138
-Let's play it.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.374
(rap song starts playing)

19:34.407 --> 19:36.142
(laughs softly)

19:36.175 --> 19:38.911
Can you believe that?
Okay, wait.

19:38.945 --> 19:40.880
I got something for you.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.583
-Close your eyes.
-Whoa.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.485
(high-pitched voice): Excuse me.
Wooden shirt coming through.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.153
EMMA:
A what coming through?

19:47.186 --> 19:48.621
Uh, open your eyes.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.492
(laughs)
What the hell?

19:52.525 --> 19:53.926
What is that?

19:53.960 --> 19:56.263
-It's a wooden shirt.
-Can I wear that?

19:56.296 --> 19:58.498
Obviously. That's why
I got it for you, fool.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.166
Well, put it on.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.068
-Put it on me.
-(laughs)

20:02.101 --> 20:03.436
Okay, it opens like a door.

20:03.470 --> 20:04.937
(chuckles)
Oh.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.072
-(gasps)
-Are you ready?

20:06.105 --> 20:07.774
-(laughs)
-Okay, you got to stop.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.442
Don't... don't do that.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.010
I realized that
if we're gonna keep doing this

20:11.043 --> 20:12.679
that you need more shirts, so...

20:12.712 --> 20:14.847
-(grunts)
-Does it fit?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.516
(both laugh)

20:16.549 --> 20:18.351
You look like the Iron Giant.
Hold on.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.287
-(laughs)
-Here are your headphones

20:20.320 --> 20:22.188
-for the...
-Oh, yeah.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.590
Get you a seatbelt
and a helmet maybe.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.725
-(song playing louder)
-Ay... (laughs)

20:25.758 --> 20:30.430
* Make my earth quake, oh,
you make my earth quake... *

20:30.463 --> 20:31.931
-Hold on, wait, you have to...
-I can't turn.

20:31.964 --> 20:35.134
No, you can't turn that way.
Uh. Uh.

20:35.167 --> 20:38.271
One more. Uh.
Two more. Mmm.

20:38.305 --> 20:41.374
-* Don't leave... *
-Ee...
-I have a plan.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.276
-What's your plan?
-So after this,

20:43.310 --> 20:44.744
we watch Friends with Benefits.

20:44.777 --> 20:46.713
-Okay.
-We cry a little bit,

20:46.746 --> 20:48.448
-laugh a little more.
-Mm-hmm.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.250
Step two-- my clothes, gone.

20:51.284 --> 20:54.487
Step three-- lady's choice.

20:54.521 --> 20:56.589
You think
you're gonna get lucky?

20:56.623 --> 20:58.458
* 'Cause when it all comes
crashing down... *

20:58.491 --> 21:00.727
-Knock on wood.
-Wow.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.228
You get it?
That was good, that was good.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.865
* Don't leave, it's my fault *

21:08.468 --> 21:13.973
* Don't leave,
it's my fault *

21:14.006 --> 21:18.345
* Don't leave, it's my fault *

my conversation *

21:32.191 --> 21:34.260
* I don't want
no conversation *

21:34.293 --> 21:38.097
* I just need some confirmation
on how you feel, for real *

21:38.130 --> 21:39.866

21:39.899 --> 21:42.435

21:42.469 --> 21:44.504

want no sovereign nation *

21:46.573 --> 21:48.641

'cause that's for real *

21:48.675 --> 21:50.610

Never look me in the eye again.
