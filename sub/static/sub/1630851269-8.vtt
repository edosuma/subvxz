She's also been indulging

So, there could be plenty of

It could be second time
lucky.

Belphagor takes the bait.

is not the long-awaited rain.

Strong winds sweep through

to find their way home.

at the burrow

17:13.099 --> 17:15.366
Where the whiskers
took cover.

17:21.441 --> 17:26.644
But swift seems to sense that
something's not quite right.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.030
Everybody starts to search the
area.

17:55.442 --> 17:58.443
Perhaps they took shelter
in a nealtrby bohole.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.314
Ough not if it's already
occupied.

18:06.719 --> 18:10.555
And certainly not if the
resident is a porcupine.

But as the day wears on,
there'l s stilno sign of them,

18:18.531 --> 18:22.866
Another explanation beco  mes
possible.

chosen not to return.

But together c theirhance of
survival is reasonable.

And with epsilon pregnant,

18:49.629 --> 18:52.897
They have the foundations
of aro new gup.

will come soon enough.

While belphegor's family
celebrates his return,

21:17.543 --> 21:21.846
Swift looks lost without
miher 3 ssing daughters.

21:24.517 --> 21:26.817
E family is late turning in
for the night

21:27.020 --> 21:28.719
At one of their
regular burrows

21:29.022 --> 21:32.323
And she's feeling the strain
with her extra load.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.560
And now there's another problem.

21:38.865 --> 21:42.466
Something about the burrow
doesn't smell right.

21:44.337 --> 21:45.603
Usually, bones or crimson

21:45.905 --> 21:48.906
Would help their mother
anstd inveigate...

21:51.411 --> 21:56.547
W but nothe responsibility falls
to teenage son beowulf.

22:04.424 --> 22:06.324
He's in for a shock.

22:11.097 --> 22:14.699
It's aaw rude akening for the
burrow's dust storm refugee,

22:14.934 --> 22:17.168
But the startled bat-eared fox

22:17.337 --> 22:19.837
Isn't going to contest
the issue.

22:23.242 --> 22:26.343
It would help swift if pandi
could now step up

22:26.646 --> 22:29.847
And geret the st of the family
ton  bed ian orderly manner.

22:34.420 --> 22:39.223
But it seems that discipline
has also departed.

22:39.525 --> 22:43.627
Pandi does nothing
el  to hp her exhausted mother.

22:47.800 --> 22:52.603
Could she be eyeing up another
chance at the whiskers crown?

22:54.607 --> 22:57.641
