WEBVTT

00:10.667 --> 00:12.667
PREVIOUSLY
ON THE L WORD...

00:18.367 --> 00:19.800
WHY IS IT SO IMPORTANT
FOR YOU TO BELIEVE

00:19.833 --> 00:21.700
THAT EVERYONE
IS SLEEPING WITH EVERYONE ELSE?

00:21.733 --> 00:23.867
[WHISPERING]
BECAUSE THEY ARE.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.367
DO YOU KNOW
THE NEIGHBORS NEXT DOOR?

00:25.400 --> 00:27.700
ARE THEY, UM...
A GAY COUPLE?

00:27.733 --> 00:29.500
YEAH, THEY ARE.

00:29.533 --> 00:32.033
BECAUSE I SAW THEM
HAVING SEX IN THEIR POOL.

00:32.067 --> 00:33.367
WE'RE HAVING A PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.933
YOU AND TIM SHOULD COME.

00:34.967 --> 00:36.533
JENNY, THIS IS MARINA.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.000
YOU GUYS SHOULD TOTALLY
TAKE THE COSMO ROMANCE QUIZ.

00:39.033 --> 00:40.200
[CHUCKLING]

00:40.233 --> 00:42.100
WHERE ARE YOU?

00:43.233 --> 00:44.100
I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:45.133 --> 00:46.667
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED?

00:46.700 --> 00:47.533
ARE YOU HAPPY?

00:47.567 --> 00:49.133
DON'T ASK ME THAT.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.933
WHY COULDN'T YOU STOP IT?
WHY WAS IT SO HARD?

00:53.967 --> 00:56.633
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US
WAS A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.667
DID YOU HEAR
WHAT SHE SAID?

00:58.700 --> 01:00.333
WE NEED
TO GET A DIVORCE.

01:00.367 --> 01:01.867
ARE YOU FREE ON SATURDAY NIGHT?

01:01.900 --> 01:03.500
I HAVE A DATE.

01:03.533 --> 01:04.267
HAS SHE TOLD YOU

01:04.300 --> 01:05.867
SHE'S A DYKE YET?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.767
I SHOULD PROBABLY
BE THE ONE TO GO.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.700
GENE, NO. I SHOULD GO.

01:08.733 --> 01:09.967
NO,

01:10.067 --> 01:10.800
I DON'T WANT EITHER OF YOU
TO LEAVE.

01:10.833 --> 01:12.200
YOU EVER NOTICE

01:12.233 --> 01:13.767
THAT EVERY TIME SHANE
WALKS INTO A ROOM,

01:13.800 --> 01:14.700
SOMEONE LEAVES CRYING?

01:14.733 --> 01:16.567
I DON'T DO RELATIONSHIPS.

01:16.600 --> 01:17.633
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT.

01:17.667 --> 01:19.100
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU CAN DO
FOR ME?

01:19.133 --> 01:20.267
ARE YOU IN LOVE
WITH HER?

01:20.300 --> 01:21.333
YEAH.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.900
LEARN TO KEEP IT
IN YOUR PANTS.

01:22.933 --> 01:24.067
OPEN THE GATE!

01:24.067 --> 01:25.900
I NEVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN!

01:25.933 --> 01:27.767
IT WAS A DELUSION.
YOU FELT THE SAME ABOUT ME.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.067
THAT KIND OF LOVE
DOES NOT EXIST.

01:30.067 --> 01:31.700
WHAT DOES SHANE HAVE
THAT I DON'T HAVE?

01:31.733 --> 01:33.067
SHE HAS NIPPLE CONFIDENCE.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.867
HEY!

01:34.900 --> 01:37.167
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT IT MEANS TO BE ME.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.867
SO GLAD TO MEET YOU.
I'M TONYA, GUEST LIAISON.

01:38.900 --> 01:40.767
I'M HERE TO TAKE CARE
OF ALL YOUR NEEDS.

01:40.800 --> 01:41.933
I CAN'T BELIEVE

01:41.967 --> 01:43.233
I'M ABOUT TO GO DOWN
ON DANA FAIRBANKS.

01:43.267 --> 01:45.167
THAT GIRL HAS
BAD FUCKING VIBES.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.067
WHEN WILL YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND
BETWEEN DICK AND PUSSY?

01:47.100 --> 01:49.200
I'M LOOKING
FOR THE SAME QUALITIES IN A MAN

01:49.233 --> 01:50.333
AS I AM IN A WOMAN.

01:50.367 --> 01:51.433
BIG TITS.

01:51.467 --> 01:52.933
WE'RE GETTING MARRIED.

01:52.967 --> 01:54.767
YOU CAN'T MARRY TONYA.

01:58.933 --> 02:00.667
LOOK, IF YOU EVER
NEED ANYONE TO TALK TO,

02:00.700 --> 02:02.067
GIVE ME A CALL.

02:02.067 --> 02:03.367
SHE WANTS TO BE YOUR HUSBAND.

02:03.400 --> 02:07.700
IF YOU WERE A MAN,
YOU WOULD BE THE PERFECT MAN.

02:09.067 --> 02:09.767
WOW.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.800
LET'S MAKE A BABY.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.400
I HAVE FOUND
THE PERFECT DONOR.

02:15.433 --> 02:17.300
HOW COULD YOU
NOT TELL ME

02:17.333 --> 02:19.267
THAT MARCUS ALLENWOOD
IS BLACK?

02:21.067 --> 02:22.600
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY.

02:22.633 --> 02:24.600
I WAS UNABLE
TO LOCATE A HEARTBEAT.

02:24.633 --> 02:27.167
I WAS ONLY 12 WEEKS,

02:27.200 --> 02:30.067
BUT I FEEL LIKE I LOST SOMEONE
I WAS WITH MY WHOLE LIFE.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.500
ALL I WANTED TO DO ALL DAY LONG
IS KISS YOU.

02:32.533 --> 02:33.667
I CAN'T.

02:33.700 --> 02:35.600
YOU CAN'T WHAT, BABE?

02:35.633 --> 02:37.667
TAKE ME SOMEWHERE.

02:39.267 --> 02:40.600
I SAW IT.

02:40.633 --> 02:41.500
I'M SORRY.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.267
FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!

02:46.967 --> 02:49.267
[***]

02:51.667 --> 02:54.167
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

02:56.067 --> 02:57.833
WHEN I DID THIS,

02:57.867 --> 03:02.733
I THOUGHT I HAD
A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF SECURITY.

03:02.767 --> 03:06.900
WHETHER IT WORKED OR NOT...

03:06.933 --> 03:09.133
I THOUGHT BETTE AND I
WERE SOLID.

03:11.067 --> 03:13.500
WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING
TO TELL BETTE?

03:13.533 --> 03:16.067
RIGHT ABOUT NOW...

03:16.067 --> 03:18.933
IF EVERYTHING LOOKED
LIKE IT WAS GOING TO GO WELL,

03:18.967 --> 03:20.800
AND NOTHING
WAS GOING TO GO WRONG

03:20.833 --> 03:24.200
LIKE LAST TIME.

03:24.233 --> 03:25.367
I DIDN'T THINK

03:25.400 --> 03:26.767
BETTE COULD HANDLE
ANOTHER MISCARRIAGE.

03:26.800 --> 03:29.067
NO?

03:29.067 --> 03:32.067
OH, MY.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.200
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

03:34.233 --> 03:37.733
YEAH, IT SORT OF...JUST POPPED.

03:40.867 --> 03:43.600
I'M NOT READY TO TELL ANYBODY.

03:43.633 --> 03:45.233
I WANT TO KEEP IT TO MYSELF
FOR A WHILE.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.600
WELL, THAT'S NOT GOING
TO BE EASY, MY DEAR.

03:48.633 --> 03:50.500
LOOKS LIKE I'M HAVING THIS BABY
ON MY OWN.

03:50.533 --> 03:52.233
THAT'S A SHAME,
TINA.

03:52.267 --> 03:53.233
DON'T SAY THAT.

03:53.267 --> 03:55.600
PEOPLE DO IT ALL THE TIME.

03:55.633 --> 03:57.467
AND YOU'RE OKAY WITH THAT?

03:57.500 --> 04:00.967
I WANT THIS BABY
MORE THAN EVER.

04:22.667 --> 04:28.967
* GIRLS IN TIGHT DRESSES
WHO DRAG WITH MUSTACHES *

04:29.067 --> 04:35.500
* CHICKS DRIVING FAST
INGENUES WITH LONG LASHES *

04:35.533 --> 04:41.667
* WOMEN WHO LONG, LOVE, LUST
WOMEN WHO GIVE *

04:41.700 --> 04:49.067
* THIS IS THE WAY
IT'S THE WAY THAT WE LIVE *

04:55.833 --> 04:57.433
* TALKING, LAUGHING
LOVING, BREATHING *

04:57.467 --> 04:59.433
* FIGHTING, FUCKING
CRYING, DRINKING *

04:59.467 --> 05:00.667
* WRITING, WINNING
LOSING, CHEATING *

05:00.700 --> 05:02.200
* KISSING, THINKING, DREAMING

05:02.233 --> 05:04.200
* THIS IS THE WAY...

05:04.233 --> 05:07.067
* THIS IS THE WAY
THAT WE LIVE *

05:07.067 --> 05:12.567
* IT'S THE WAY THAT WE LIVE

05:20.367 --> 05:22.633

05:53.400 --> 05:56.267
I WAS SO HAPPY
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

05:59.433 --> 06:01.933
HELLO?

06:01.967 --> 06:04.733
HI.

06:04.767 --> 06:06.967
HEY,
WHERE DID YOU GO?

06:11.067 --> 06:13.067
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:33.167 --> 06:34.567
DAMN IT.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.467
WHY DID I GET THIS ASSIGNMENT?

06:36.500 --> 06:38.300
I AM SO NOT A KNITTER.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.933
WELL, IT'S
CRAZY POPULAR,

06:39.967 --> 06:41.600
AND ALL THE FAGS I KNOW
ARE DOING IT.

06:41.633 --> 06:43.100
EVEN SOME OF THE
STRAIGHT BOYS, TOO.

06:43.133 --> 06:44.100
RIGHT, SEE?

06:44.133 --> 06:45.100
MEN SHOULD BE KNITTING,

06:45.133 --> 06:46.600
AND WOMEN SHOULD BE
RUNNING THE WORLD.

06:46.633 --> 06:48.067
THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

06:48.067 --> 06:49.067
THAT'S WHAT I'M
GOING TO WRITE

06:49.100 --> 06:50.767
FOR L.A. MAGAZINE.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.767
IT'S GOOD.

06:51.800 --> 06:52.767
YEAH, GO FOR IT.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.133
THEY'LL LOVE IT.

06:54.167 --> 06:56.767
HOW'S TINA?

06:56.800 --> 06:58.500
WELL, BETTE STILL
HASN'T CALLED HER.

06:58.533 --> 07:00.067
THERE'S SOMETHING
REALLY WRONG

07:00.067 --> 07:02.133
WHEN GOD LETS TWO PEOPLE
WHO ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER

07:02.167 --> 07:03.133
COME APART LIKE THAT.

07:03.167 --> 07:05.333
YOU BELIEVE IN GOD?

07:05.367 --> 07:08.067
WHAT?

07:08.067 --> 07:09.967
THIS COFFEE TASTES
LIKE POOPY SHIT.

07:10.067 --> 07:12.467
WHERE'S MARINA?

07:12.500 --> 07:13.633
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER
FOR DAYS.

07:13.667 --> 07:14.733
I HAVE NO IDEA.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.167
ME NEITHER.

07:17.200 --> 07:19.467
SO, LISTEN,
DO YOU, UM...

07:19.500 --> 07:22.633
WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING, OR...

07:22.667 --> 07:23.833
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT
FRIENDS ARE FOR,

07:23.867 --> 07:26.533
IF YOU'D LIKE TO TALK.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.867
I'VE GOT NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

07:29.900 --> 07:30.867
SHANE.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.200
WHAT?

07:32.233 --> 07:34.200
OH, QUIT BEING
SUCH A LEZ.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.200
WELL, WHAT?

07:35.233 --> 07:37.133
YOU'RE JUST BACK
FROM CHERIE JAFFE LAND.

07:37.167 --> 07:38.200
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

07:38.233 --> 07:39.667
I'M STILL ME.

07:39.700 --> 07:42.767
OH, SO YOU STILL LIVE
BY THE CODE.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.500
YOU DON'T DO
RELATIONSHIPS.

07:44.533 --> 07:45.633
IT'S NOT A CODE.

07:45.667 --> 07:46.833
IT'S ME.

07:48.600 --> 07:49.967
OH, SHIT.

07:52.900 --> 07:54.067
OH, NO.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.633
I CANNOT TAKE CRUELLA DE VIL
THIS MORNING.

07:55.667 --> 07:56.667
DO SOME--

07:56.700 --> 07:58.367
PRETEND I'M UPSET.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.533
PUT YOUR ARM
AROUND ME.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.800
I'LL JUST START SOBBING,
AND, OBVIOUSLY,

08:02.833 --> 08:05.067
IT'LL BE A REALLY
INTIMATE MOMENT.

08:05.100 --> 08:08.600
I MEAN, NO HALFWAY
SENSITIVE PERSON

08:08.633 --> 08:10.233
WOULD EVER DREAM
OF INTERRUPTING.

08:10.267 --> 08:11.300
OH, YOU GUYS.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.967
THIS PLACE
IS FALLING APART.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.700
DID YOU GUYS HEAR
WHAT HAPPENED TO MARINA?

08:16.733 --> 08:18.100
WHAT?

08:34.900 --> 08:36.800
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN,
COMPLETE AND TOTAL.

08:36.833 --> 08:37.967
SHE HAD TO BE HOSPITALIZED.

08:38.067 --> 08:39.800
SHE TRIED TO
OFF HERSELF?

08:39.833 --> 08:41.700
SHE CUT HER WRISTS
AT THE BEL AIR HOTEL,

08:41.733 --> 08:43.067
IN THE PENTHOUSE SUITE.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.067
THAT'S HORRIBLE!

08:44.100 --> 08:45.233
SHE WAS WEARING

08:45.267 --> 08:46.133
THAT FABULOUS
DOLCE & GABBANA SUIT,

08:46.167 --> 08:46.933
THE MEN'S CUT.

08:46.967 --> 08:47.933
WE SHOULD SEE HER.

08:47.967 --> 08:49.067
TOO LATE.

08:49.067 --> 08:49.700
HER MOTHER PUT HER
ON A PLANE.

08:49.733 --> 08:50.567
SHE'S BACK IN MILAN.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.733
SHE'S A CONTESSA, YOU KNOW.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.300
I KNOW,
SHE'S A CONTESSA.

08:53.333 --> 08:54.600
MARINA'S A CONTESSA.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.100
HONEY! HONEY.

08:56.133 --> 08:58.067
HONEY, HONEY,
COME HERE.

08:58.067 --> 08:59.233
HI.

08:59.267 --> 09:00.700
I WAS JUST
TELLING THE GIRLS

09:00.733 --> 09:02.500
HOW I ALMOST BECAME
YOUR FUTURE EX-WIFE

09:02.533 --> 09:04.133
LAST NIGHT.

09:04.167 --> 09:05.600
I KIND OF FREAKED OUT
WITH THE WEDDING PLANNERS.

09:05.633 --> 09:06.600
EXCUSE ME,

09:06.633 --> 09:07.767
WE NEED A GREEN TEA.

09:07.800 --> 09:09.167
ICED.

09:11.133 --> 09:12.100
ARE YOU OKAY?

09:12.133 --> 09:13.700
HMM?

09:13.733 --> 09:15.067
YEAH.

09:15.067 --> 09:16.700
I'M FREAKED OUT
ABOUT MARINA.

09:16.733 --> 09:17.700
OH, YEAH.

09:17.733 --> 09:19.200
THANK GOD
FOR THE BELLBOY.

09:19.233 --> 09:20.700
HE CAME IN
RIGHT AS SHE WAS ABOUT TO JUMP.

09:20.733 --> 09:21.767
WAIT, WAIT.

09:21.800 --> 09:22.933
YOU SAID
SHE SLIT HER WRISTS.

09:22.967 --> 09:24.433
LOOK AT YOU,
ALL SWEATY.

09:24.467 --> 09:25.600
ISN'T IT CUTE

09:25.633 --> 09:27.333
HOW SHE PERSPIRES
SO MUCH?

09:27.367 --> 09:29.633
SO HOW'S TINA?

09:29.667 --> 09:31.433
HAS BETTE CALLED YET?

09:31.467 --> 09:32.967
APPARENTLY,

09:33.067 --> 09:35.967
SHE WALKED IN ON THEM
IN THEIR VERY OWN BEDROOM.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.067
OKAY, MISS INSIDE STORY,

09:38.067 --> 09:40.233
HOW DID TINA
FIND OUT?

09:40.267 --> 09:42.367
WELL, ACTUALLY, TONYA,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.267
SHE GUESSED,

09:44.300 --> 09:45.367
BECAUSE SHE SAW THEM
TOUCHING HANDS

09:45.400 --> 09:47.100
AND THEN SHE KNEW EVERYTHING.

09:48.533 --> 09:49.967
HOW COULD SHE TELL
JUST BY SEEING THEM TOUCH HANDS?

09:50.067 --> 09:51.467
WOMEN CAN DO THAT.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.700
YEAH,
ESPECIALLY DYKES.

09:52.733 --> 09:53.867
WELL,
I DON'T KNOW

09:53.900 --> 09:54.933
WHAT BETTE
WAS THINKING.

09:54.967 --> 09:56.067
I MEAN,
YOU DON'T STEP OUT

09:56.067 --> 09:57.533
ON A WOMAN LIKE TINA

09:57.567 --> 09:58.600
FOR SOMEBODY
WHO HAMMERS PLANKS

09:58.633 --> 09:59.800
FOR A LIVING.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.800
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, TONYA?

10:00.833 --> 10:02.300
THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY

10:02.333 --> 10:03.767
IF CANDACE
HAD A BETTER JOB?

10:03.800 --> 10:05.267
GUYS, IT'S NOT OUR BUSINESS.
BUT BETTE LOVES TINA.

10:05.300 --> 10:06.567
THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT IT.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.600
SO THEN
THEY COULD JUST--

10:07.633 --> 10:09.167
WHY CAN'T THEY WORK IT OUT?

10:09.200 --> 10:11.233
BECAUSE IT'S A SEX THING,
AND BETTE CAN'T HELP IT.

10:11.267 --> 10:12.467
SO IF IT'S JUST
A SEX THING,

10:12.500 --> 10:14.933
THEN YOU CAN GET IT
UNDER CONTROL, RIGHT?

10:14.967 --> 10:15.833
WOMEN CAN CONTROL IT.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.300
A MAN SOMETIMES CAN'T

10:17.333 --> 10:18.433
BECAUSE THEY'RE CONTROLLED
BY THEIR PECKERS.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.367
THERE IS
NO DIFFERENCE

10:19.400 --> 10:20.400
BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN,

10:20.433 --> 10:21.667
AND THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE,

10:21.700 --> 10:22.867
OR BETTE WOULD HAVE
CALLED IT OFF.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.167
BETTE IS STILL SCHTUPPING
THE CARPENTER?

10:26.200 --> 10:27.767
I FEEL SO AWFUL FOR TINA.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.433
GUYS.

10:29.467 --> 10:30.833
WELL, BETTE BETTER GET
THAT PECKER UNDER CONTROL.

10:30.867 --> 10:31.367
GUYS!

10:36.133 --> 10:39.600
YOU KNOW
THOSE SKINNY JAPANESE ONES?

10:39.633 --> 10:40.933
THEY DON'T REALLY LOOK
LIKE MUSHROOMS, YOU KNOW?

10:40.967 --> 10:43.367
THEY KIND OF LOOK
MORE LIKE NOODLES

10:43.400 --> 10:44.733
OR SOMETHING.

10:44.767 --> 10:46.000
I NEVER KNOW...

10:46.033 --> 10:50.367
WHAT TO DO WITH THEM.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.133
WHAT?
OH, I'M SORRY.

10:52.167 --> 10:53.233
I'M SORRY.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.167
WHAT WERE YOU
SAYING?

10:55.200 --> 10:57.200
AH, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT MUSHROOMS.

10:57.233 --> 10:58.667
RIGHT, RIGHT,
RIGHT.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.167
DO YOU LIKE
MUSHROOMS?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.800
SELECTIVELY.

11:02.833 --> 11:04.133
YOU?

11:04.167 --> 11:08.067
UM, THEY REALLY DO
SCARE ME.

11:08.067 --> 11:09.367
GOD, I REMEMBER
IN THIRD GRADE

11:09.400 --> 11:12.133
THERE WAS THIS
BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

11:12.167 --> 11:13.700
GOD. GORGEOUS.

11:13.733 --> 11:15.133
HER NAME WAS MIRIAM,

11:15.167 --> 11:16.933
AND SHE HAD
THIS WILD MUSHROOM,

11:16.967 --> 11:18.600
AND JUST WAS IN HOSPITAL
FOR, LIKE, THREE WEEKS,

11:18.633 --> 11:21.233
AND HAD
THIS ALLERGIC REACTION,

11:21.267 --> 11:24.500
AND, GOD, SHE MISSED
THE RELAY RACE...

11:24.533 --> 11:25.500
WOW,
I'VE NEVER ACTUALLY

11:25.533 --> 11:27.833
SEEN ONIONS
ON A STEM BEFORE.

11:27.867 --> 11:28.833
DO THEY TASTE
DIFFERENT?

11:28.867 --> 11:30.500
SMELL THEM.

11:30.533 --> 11:32.367
OH.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.700
THAT'S VERY STRONG.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.733
DO YOU WANT TO
FUCK HER RIGHT HERE,

11:36.767 --> 11:37.967
OR DO YOU BOTH

11:38.067 --> 11:39.367
WANT TO COME BACK
TO MY PLACE?

11:39.400 --> 11:40.700
HMM?

11:40.733 --> 11:42.200
GENE.

11:42.233 --> 11:42.867
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
MY ROOMMATE'S AROUND.

11:42.900 --> 11:44.600
NO, NO, NO, I'M SORRY.

11:48.933 --> 11:51.667
OKAY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:51.700 --> 11:52.967
I DIDN'T PRESSURE
YOU INTO THIS,

11:53.067 --> 11:53.967
ALL RIGHT?

11:54.067 --> 11:55.833
YOU SAID YOU WANTED
TO KEEP SEEING ME,

11:55.867 --> 11:57.300
SO...

11:57.333 --> 11:58.467
YEAH, I KNOW.

11:58.500 --> 12:00.233
I KNOW, AND I SAID
THAT I LIKE YOU.

12:00.267 --> 12:01.833
WELL, THAT'S REALLY NICE,
YOU KNOW?

12:01.867 --> 12:03.400
I LIKE YOU TOO...

12:03.433 --> 12:04.733
BUT WE DON'T HAVE SEX.

12:04.767 --> 12:06.300
OKAY? THERE IT IS.

12:06.333 --> 12:07.567
I'D LIKE TO BE
HAVING SEX

12:07.600 --> 12:09.433
WITH THE WOMAN I COOK FOR,

12:09.467 --> 12:10.900
MAKE MIX TAPES FOR YOU--

12:10.933 --> 12:13.833
YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE SEX,
AND I KNOW WHY.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.667
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE GAY,
ALL RIGHT?

12:16.700 --> 12:17.667
THAT'S IT.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.167
I'M SORRY
TO BREAK IT TO YOU,

12:19.200 --> 12:21.367
BUT YOU ARE
A GIRL-LOVING,

12:21.400 --> 12:22.833
FULL-ON LESBIAN.

12:25.933 --> 12:28.267
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S FOR YOU TO SAY.

12:28.300 --> 12:29.267
WELL, DEAL WITH IT,

12:29.300 --> 12:32.100
ALL RIGHT?

12:32.133 --> 12:33.933
GOOD LUCK.

12:52.167 --> 12:55.067
ARE WE EVER GOING TO
TALK ABOUT THIS?

12:55.067 --> 12:56.600
TALK ABOUT WHAT?

13:01.800 --> 13:03.433
OKAY.

13:03.467 --> 13:05.400
HOLD ON.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.400
IT WAS A MISTAKE,
RIGHT?

13:16.067 --> 13:17.333
IF YOU SAY SO.

13:17.367 --> 13:18.533
WELL,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

13:18.567 --> 13:19.533
DO YOU HAVE
ANYTHING TO SAY?

13:19.567 --> 13:22.433
YOU WERE THE ONE
WHO KISSED ME FIRST.

13:22.467 --> 13:25.833
I KIND OF REMEMBER
YOU KISSING ME BACK.

13:28.233 --> 13:31.167
AFTER YOU STARTED IT.

13:35.567 --> 13:38.433
SO IF I WAS TO KISS YOU AGAIN?

13:59.333 --> 14:01.400
OH, YOU KNOW.

14:01.433 --> 14:02.867
OH...

14:02.900 --> 14:04.967
YOU KNOW.

14:05.067 --> 14:07.067
OH, ALICE'LL KNOW.

14:07.067 --> 14:09.533
ALICE, WHAT'S THE...
BOOKING AGENCY,

14:09.567 --> 14:10.867
NOT SMASH BOX, BUT YOU KNOW--

14:10.900 --> 14:12.267
FRED SEGAL
HAIR AND MAKEUP?

14:12.300 --> 14:13.267
TONYA, LISTEN,
IT'S COOL, ALL RIGHT?

14:13.300 --> 14:14.400
THE AGENCY IS FINE.

14:14.433 --> 14:15.367
THEY GOT ME A JOB.

14:15.400 --> 14:16.200
[TINA]:
WHO'S THE CLIENT?

14:16.233 --> 14:18.133
UM, ARIANNA SOMEONE.

14:18.167 --> 14:20.367
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON?

14:20.400 --> 14:22.533
YEAH. SHE WROTE A BOOK.

14:22.567 --> 14:24.233
SHE'S DOING
A BOOK TOUR,

14:24.267 --> 14:25.367
AND SHE'S DOING
ALL THESE TV TALK SHOWS.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.800
DAVID LETTERMAN, JAY LENO,
BILL O'REILLY?

14:26.833 --> 14:27.800
COME ON.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.200
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON
IS 50.

14:29.233 --> 14:30.867
SHE'S NOT REALLY YOUR TYPE.

14:30.900 --> 14:32.367
SHE'S KIND OF FANCY.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.933
I'M DOING HER HAIR, AL.
I'M NOT GOING TO FUCK HER.

14:33.967 --> 14:35.867
OH, BECAUSE THE OLD SHANE
WOULD HAVE.

14:35.900 --> 14:36.867
OH.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.433
WELL, IN THAT CASE,
IF SHE'S HOT--

14:40.800 --> 14:41.800
HONEY,

14:41.833 --> 14:44.833
SHANE IS DOING
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON.

14:44.867 --> 14:46.300
YOU'RE DOING
ARIANNA HUFFINGTON?

14:46.333 --> 14:47.900
SHE'S 50, SHANE.

14:47.933 --> 14:48.900
HER HAIR.

14:48.933 --> 14:50.200
OH.

14:50.233 --> 14:51.200
LOOK, IT'S GREAT,
SHANE.

14:51.233 --> 14:52.733
IT IS.

14:52.767 --> 14:53.867
IF THINGS GO WELL
WITH ARIANNA HUFFINGTON,

14:53.900 --> 14:55.733
THEN MAYBE YOU CAN GET
SOME FILM CLIENTS.

14:55.767 --> 14:56.867
YOU COULD GO
ON LOCATION.

14:56.900 --> 14:57.867
YOU COULD TRAVEL.

14:57.900 --> 14:58.867
YEAH, THAT WOULD BE COOL.

14:58.900 --> 14:59.867
YEAH,
THAT'S GREAT.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.200
I'VE GOT TO GO, YOU GUYS.

15:07.800 --> 15:08.967
DON'T WORRY,

15:09.067 --> 15:10.533
I'M NOT GOING TO ASK
TO JOIN YOU.

15:10.567 --> 15:13.700
I KNOW THAT YOU ALL
PROBABLY THINK I'M A MONSTER.

15:13.733 --> 15:16.400
I JUST-- I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I NEED TO SAY TO TINA.

15:16.433 --> 15:17.867
DO YOU WANT US TO GO?
NO.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.500
IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,
SAY IT HERE.

15:25.800 --> 15:29.067
TINA...

15:29.067 --> 15:33.433
I DIDN'T TRY TO SEE YOU
OR CALL YOU UNTIL NOW

15:33.467 --> 15:36.100
BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE

15:36.133 --> 15:38.400
THAT I COULD DO
WHAT YOU ASKED OF ME.

15:38.433 --> 15:40.633
I PROMISE

15:40.667 --> 15:42.567
I AM NOT EVER
GOING TO SEE HER AGAIN.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.767
I AM NOT EVER GOING TO SPEAK
TO HER AGAIN.

15:44.800 --> 15:47.867
I AM NOT EVER GOING TO THINK
ABOUT HER AGAIN.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.367
I MISS YOU.

15:53.400 --> 15:54.767
MORE THAN THAT.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.433
I NEED YOU.

15:56.467 --> 15:59.133
I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN--

15:59.167 --> 16:01.400
I DON'T THINK
THAT I CAN LIVE WITHOUT YOU.

16:05.300 --> 16:08.633
IT IS COMPLETELY
AND TOTALLY OVER.

16:15.067 --> 16:17.300
WHEN DID YOU END IT?

16:17.333 --> 16:18.900
THIS MORNING.

16:18.933 --> 16:20.833
I TOLD HER THAT YOU WERE
THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

16:20.867 --> 16:22.533
AND THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS DOING,

16:22.567 --> 16:25.133
AND THAT I MUST HAVE GONE
TEMPORARILY INSANE.

16:25.167 --> 16:30.867
DID YOU TELL HER IN PERSON
OR ON THE PHONE?

16:30.900 --> 16:32.133
WHY DOES THAT MATTER?

16:32.167 --> 16:34.533
BECAUSE I DROVE BY THE HOUSE
AT 2:00 A.M.,

16:34.567 --> 16:36.067
AND YOUR CAR WASN'T THERE.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.600
DID YOU FUCK
ALL NIGHT

16:37.633 --> 16:39.133
BEFORE YOU TOLD HER

16:39.167 --> 16:40.133
I WAS THE LOVE
OF YOUR LIFE

16:40.167 --> 16:41.100
THIS MORNING?

16:49.700 --> 16:51.600
[GASPS]

16:59.800 --> 17:01.867
SO RENTALS ARE THE CASH COW
OF THE BUSINESS,

17:01.900 --> 17:04.900
BUT MY REAL LOVE
IS PICTURE CARS.

17:04.933 --> 17:06.067
PICTURE CARS?

17:06.100 --> 17:08.067
YEAH, FOR THE MOVIES.

17:08.067 --> 17:09.533
OH, YEAH.

17:09.567 --> 17:11.133
A DIRECTOR WILL COME IN
AND TELL ME

17:11.167 --> 17:12.400
HE WANTS TO PUT BILLY BOB

17:12.433 --> 17:14.667
IN THE EXACT SOUPED-UP
HEMI UNDER GLASS

17:14.700 --> 17:16.567
BOB RIGGLE DROVE
IN THE STOCK CAR RACES

17:16.600 --> 17:18.700
IN JERSEY
WHEN HE WAS A KID, YOU KNOW?

17:18.733 --> 17:20.967
HE'LL WANT THE SLICKS
AND THE SCOOPS

17:21.067 --> 17:22.600
AND THE PINK PANTHER FLAMES,

17:22.633 --> 17:25.567
EXACTLY LIKE HE REMEMBERS IT
IN HIS HEAD.

17:25.600 --> 17:26.767
IVAN,
YOU ARE SPEAKING

17:26.800 --> 17:29.867
A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
TO ME...

17:29.900 --> 17:33.200
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
DOES TO A GIRL.

17:33.233 --> 17:34.267
LET'S GO INSIDE.

17:34.300 --> 17:35.333
I GOT SOMETHING
I WANT TO SHOW YOU.

17:35.367 --> 17:36.900
COME ON.

17:36.933 --> 17:38.967
BY DRIVING
INTO THE WALL

17:39.067 --> 17:40.767
OF THE HOTEL PARKING GARAGE?

17:40.800 --> 17:41.933
DOESN'T SOUND

17:41.967 --> 17:44.067
LIKE A VERY SERIOUS
SUICIDE ATTEMPT TO ME.

17:44.067 --> 17:45.867
YEAH, BUT THAT'S
THE TALK AT THE PLANET.

17:45.900 --> 17:46.867
YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:46.900 --> 17:47.967
I FEEL SO BAD

17:48.067 --> 17:49.333
BECAUSE
I DIDN'T KNOW

17:49.367 --> 17:51.700
SHE WAS HURTING
THAT MUCH.

17:51.733 --> 17:52.867
I KNOW, I KNOW.

17:52.900 --> 17:56.600
LET GO AND LET GOD.

17:56.633 --> 17:57.900
OH...

17:57.933 --> 17:59.400
IVAN AYCOCK,

17:59.433 --> 18:02.767
VINTAGE RESTORER
TO THE STARS.

18:02.800 --> 18:04.267
THAT'S THE BOMB.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.567
I HAD NO IDEA.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.400
THIS IS YOUR OFFICE.

18:08.433 --> 18:09.800
LOOK,
I INVITED YOU HERE

18:09.833 --> 18:12.400
BECAUSE I HAVE
A LITTLE PRESENT FOR YOU.

18:17.100 --> 18:18.933
OH, IVAN, I-I--

18:18.967 --> 18:20.167
IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.367
OPEN IT.

18:31.500 --> 18:32.900
OKAY.

18:32.933 --> 18:36.333
THIS IS A KEY TO MY APARTMENT.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.900
I LIVE TWO BLOCKS
FROM THE PLANET.

18:38.933 --> 18:40.400
I JUST WANT YOU
TO FEEL FREE TO STOP BY

18:40.433 --> 18:41.733
ANYTIME YOU NEED
A BREAK FROM WORK.

18:41.767 --> 18:45.400
OH, IVAN,
IT'S NOT A DONE DEAL YET.

18:45.433 --> 18:47.800
I STILL HAVE TO GO
TO THE BANK TOMORROW

18:47.833 --> 18:49.600
AND HAVE MY MEETING,
AND THEN...

18:49.633 --> 18:52.333
I HAVE A LOT TO WORK OUT
WITH MARINA'S FAMILY.

18:52.367 --> 18:54.300
HER MOM IS SOME KIND
OF DAMN CONTESSA.

18:54.333 --> 18:57.500
SHE MAY BE A CONTESSA,

18:57.533 --> 19:00.467
BUT AS FAR
AS I'M CONCERNED...

19:00.500 --> 19:02.600
KIT, YOU'RE A QUEEN.

19:02.633 --> 19:04.667
DON'T YOU FORGET IT.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.467
WHAT'S THIS ONE FOR?

19:31.433 --> 19:34.367
THAT LOOKS
LIKE MY CAR.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.433
SORT OF.

19:36.467 --> 19:39.733
I DID
A LITTLE WORK ON IT.

19:39.767 --> 19:41.067
A LITTLE?

19:41.100 --> 19:41.767
A LITTLE RESTORATION

19:41.800 --> 19:43.067
TO HELP YOU CELEBRATE

19:43.067 --> 19:45.067
YOUR GETTING
YOUR LICENSE RESTORED.

19:46.900 --> 19:50.133
NO ONE'S EVER DONE ANYTHING
LIKE THAT FOR ME.

19:50.167 --> 19:53.600
I-I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO THANK YOU.

20:03.933 --> 20:07.067
NOT YET.

20:07.100 --> 20:08.833
WHY?

20:08.867 --> 20:11.467
BECAUSE
YOU'RE NOT SURE,

20:11.500 --> 20:15.600
AND I WANT YOU
TO BE SURE.

20:17.700 --> 20:18.933
COME ON, GORGEOUS,

20:18.967 --> 20:20.233
LET'S GO TAKE IT
FOR A SPIN.

20:20.267 --> 20:22.000
COME ON.

20:30.933 --> 20:32.400
WOW.

20:32.433 --> 20:35.767
OOH. OOH, YES.

20:38.367 --> 20:39.700
OH, MY GOD.

20:39.733 --> 20:42.467
IT LOOKS FABULOUS. OH...

20:45.400 --> 20:47.033
WOW.

20:47.067 --> 20:48.033
SO OBERLIN'S

20:48.067 --> 20:50.033
SUPPOSED TO BE
A REALLY GREAT SCHOOL.

20:50.067 --> 20:51.467
YEAH,
IT'S A GREAT TEAM.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.633

27:09.067 --> 27:10.267
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

LAST WEEK,

29:28.900 --> 29:30.300
AND, I MEAN, THIS IS--

29:30.333 --> 29:32.267

30:23.700 --> 30:25.700
WHERE DOES THIS LEAD?

30:25.733 --> 30:28.500
OH, IT WAS
FOR MY FATHER.

30:28.533 --> 30:30.033
I NEVER MET HIM,

30:30.067 --> 30:34.300
BUT...SUPPOSEDLY

30:34.333 --> 30:38.833
HE WAS SOME KIND
OF MAYAN MEDICINE MAN.

30:38.867 --> 30:41.500
AND HOW COME
YOU NEVER MET HIM?

30:41.533 --> 30:43.000
HE DIED
IN A MOTORCYCLE CRASH

30:43.033 --> 30:45.133
BEFORE I WAS BORN.

30:48.433 --> 30:49.367

31:38.800 --> 31:40.300

31:57.533 --> 31:58.967
WHO DO YOU THINK'S
GOING TO FUND THAT?

31:59.067 --> 32:00.067
I APPLIED

32:00.067 --> 32:01.067
TO THE AHMANSON
FOUNDATION.

32:01.067 --> 32:02.267
NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN.

32:02.300 --> 32:05.967
THEY'RE WAY
TOO CONSERVATIVE.

32:06.067 --> 32:08.067
NO!

32:08.100 --> 32:09.300
THIS IS, LIKE,
THE FIFTH TIME SHE'S CALLED.

32:09.333 --> 32:10.433
