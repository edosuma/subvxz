00:14.915 --> 00:16.850
Woman:
You know, when I first
discovered the lump

00:16.917 --> 00:19.953
I just knew
it was something,
you know?

00:20.020 --> 00:24.392
Even though
the doctor told me
I had fibrous breasts.

00:24.458 --> 00:27.428
Yeah, a double
mastectomy later,

00:27.495 --> 00:29.897
I learned how to
trust my gut.

00:29.963 --> 00:31.399
Maura:
That's terrifying.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.767
You know, it was
really hard, you know.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.736
I was sick as a dog.

00:35.803 --> 00:39.273
But enough about me.
[sighs]

00:39.340 --> 00:41.942
They lopped off my tits.
So what, right?

00:42.009 --> 00:46.580
Mm. Do you want
a showery or a bathy?

00:46.647 --> 00:48.582
Are you a showery
or a bathy?

00:48.649 --> 00:49.750
I'm a showery.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.119
I used to be
a showery.

00:51.185 --> 00:53.621
But I--
I'm becoming a bathy.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.326
Okay, um--

00:58.392 --> 01:02.963
Are you comfortable
sharing a room? I am.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.933
Yeah, I guess
you could say I'm NATO.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.000
What is NATO?

01:07.135 --> 01:08.836
Not Attached to Outcome.

01:23.151 --> 01:24.585
Well, that's very pretty.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.655
What is this?

01:27.721 --> 01:28.822
It's a bracelet.

01:28.889 --> 01:30.458
Is that real turquoise?

01:30.524 --> 01:31.492
It is.

01:34.895 --> 01:35.863
Thank you.

01:39.600 --> 01:40.568
Here.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.506
Want to spoon?

01:49.042 --> 01:51.179
Am I the spooner
or the spoonee?

01:51.179 --> 01:52.513
You're the spoonee.

01:55.749 --> 01:58.286
That's good.

01:58.352 --> 02:00.254
You like to be spooned?

02:00.321 --> 02:01.589
I do.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.863
Your heart's beating
pretty fast.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.368
[sighs]

02:15.403 --> 02:16.570
Is this rude?

02:16.637 --> 02:18.206
No, it's good.

02:33.287 --> 02:36.424

03:21.335 --> 03:24.472

05:18.085 --> 05:19.553
[laughter]

05:28.161 --> 05:29.229
[coughing]

05:29.296 --> 05:30.263
Trespassers.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.232
- Sarah: Ha, ha.
- Get in.

05:32.299 --> 05:34.034
Come on,
it's so warm.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.302
You guys high?

05:35.403 --> 05:37.571
Not anymore.
[laughs]

05:37.638 --> 05:40.874
Sarah: Come in,
come in, come in.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.243
All right.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.078
[laughter]

05:45.145 --> 05:46.113
Ready?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.788
- Fuck, that hurt!
- Did that hurt?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.324
- Did it?
- Oh, my God!

05:57.425 --> 05:58.726
[laughing]

06:06.734 --> 06:09.570
You guys think that
the beginning of the end
of the Pfeffermans

06:09.637 --> 06:12.139
was, like,
the day we stopped
swimming in this pool?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.475
There was
an actual day?

06:14.542 --> 06:16.444
It was like
a summer.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.711
I remember that.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.448
That was the summer
I got my period.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.450
And I was wearing
maxi pads.

06:22.483 --> 06:25.152
And I wanted to
come in with you guys
but I wouldn't.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.121
And then, like,
two months later,
the, um--

06:28.188 --> 06:30.123
the, uh, pool guy quit.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.325
Unrelated to your period.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.628
[laughs] Yes,
unrelated to my period.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.930
Why would it be
related to my period?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.166
Sounded like
it was related.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.034
[laughing]

06:42.335 --> 06:44.271
No. It was a
coincidence.

06:44.337 --> 06:46.474
The pool guy quits.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.642
Then the pool
fills up with leaves,

06:48.709 --> 06:52.913
and goes fully leafy
for two whole years.

06:52.980 --> 06:54.848
- Well--
- Because no one
will scoop it.

06:54.915 --> 06:58.686
Ali: Yeah, the bottom
got all gray and green
and brown.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.721
- And copper.
- Sarah: It was,
like, slick.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.623
You could slide on it.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.692
Oh, my God,
doesn't this feel
amazing?

07:04.758 --> 07:07.227
I actually do feel like
I kind of turned a corner

07:07.294 --> 07:08.796
out there in the woods.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.931
I'm thinking that,
I don't know,

07:10.998 --> 07:13.667
maybe I'm just gonna,
like, look into religion,

07:13.734 --> 07:16.369
God or get my goddess on.

07:16.504 --> 07:17.671
- [laughing]
- No, seriously.

07:17.738 --> 07:18.772
I'm actually
thinking about, like,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.173
looking into
Judaism more,

07:20.240 --> 07:24.311
and finding out, you know,
my spiritual mojo.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.213
Oh, Judaism.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.617
Just, you know--

07:29.683 --> 07:32.520
you gotta promise me--

07:32.586 --> 07:34.087
What?

07:34.154 --> 07:35.188
What?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.990
No Raquel.

07:37.057 --> 07:38.058
Not Raquel.

07:38.125 --> 07:40.528
Guys. Tea party.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.695
Tea party, tea party,
tea party.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.263
- Tea party.
- Okay. Ready?

07:43.330 --> 07:45.198
- Ready?
- [inhaling]

07:45.265 --> 07:47.300
[water gurgling]

07:47.367 --> 07:50.538
**

08:36.016 --> 08:36.984
Ooh.

08:39.219 --> 08:40.220
[moaning]

08:46.994 --> 08:49.262
- Vickie.
- Yeah?

08:49.329 --> 08:52.165
[sighs]

08:52.232 --> 08:53.734
I don't know what to do.

08:53.801 --> 08:57.037
What would you like?

08:57.104 --> 08:59.406
I'm not sure.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.174
You want to see me?

09:21.795 --> 09:24.898
What about this?
On or off?

09:24.965 --> 09:26.634
Uh, off.

09:26.700 --> 09:31.271
- Off. Okay.
- No, no, no, no.

09:31.338 --> 09:33.273
- On.
- Okay.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.643
For now, on.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.145
Yes.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.216
[moaning]

09:55.395 --> 09:58.198
[loud moaning]

09:58.265 --> 10:00.734
Oh, God!
My God!

10:00.801 --> 10:03.103
[panting]

10:18.618 --> 10:21.755
Man: I love where
the rock wall takes you.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.456
You notice all
the extra spaces.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.557
You guys,
I just realized

10:24.624 --> 10:25.959
that this is
the first time

10:26.026 --> 10:27.961
that we're all single
at the same time.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.731
Since, like,
I don't-- Forever.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.599
Oh, my God.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.634
- We should, uh--
- That's so weird.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.704
We should all get married
in a thrupple.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.972
Incest is best, yo.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.842
Will you help me
take care of my kids?

10:41.909 --> 10:44.945
Woman: [on TV]
I could not have got a--
a better space for myself.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.714
I like this, too.
Who'd have thought of that?

10:46.780 --> 10:49.016
Man: Sure, I mean,
I really was feeling,
like,

10:49.082 --> 10:53.353
one of the most
important things that we
could use this space for--

10:53.420 --> 10:54.822
Can I have this?

10:56.389 --> 10:58.025
Please.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.728
Woman: I want to
start doing work
right now.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.029
Man: And all your
medical books

11:02.095 --> 11:03.731
would be stored
on the bookshelf.

11:03.731 --> 11:06.133
In fact, there's a ton
of storage space.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.835
See, under--
under here--

11:07.901 --> 11:09.436
Woman: Oh, I see that.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.038
Man: Right, so you have
nice little storage area

11:11.104 --> 11:12.505
here in the ottoman.

11:12.572 --> 11:16.409
Bring it inside.
Open up this big panel--

11:19.079 --> 11:20.247
I had this recurring dream

11:20.313 --> 11:22.850
that I have a
finite amount of time.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.384
It's like I have
one hour,

11:24.451 --> 11:27.587
and in that hour
I have to say goodbye
to someone I love

11:27.654 --> 11:28.822
who is about to die,

11:28.889 --> 11:30.858
and I have to
say it perfectly.

11:30.924 --> 11:32.659
Because it's so important.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.561
And every time
I look at the clock,

11:34.627 --> 11:36.964
the clock ticks forward
one more minute,

11:37.030 --> 11:41.001
and that is one minute
that I have lost.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.770
I don't even know
who it is

11:42.770 --> 11:44.637
It might be my mom.
I have no idea.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.906
What's she like?

11:45.973 --> 11:47.340
- My mom?
- Yeah.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.476
My mo--

11:49.542 --> 11:51.912
I haven't seen my mom
in a while.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.447
I mean,
I'm embarrassed to say.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.850
Go on, say.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.186
I haven't seen my mom
in three years.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.455
Was it because
she didn't support
your transition or--

12:02.522 --> 12:04.357
No, it was
different things.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.794
I mean...

12:06.794 --> 12:10.363
she's never seen me...

12:10.430 --> 12:11.398
as Maura.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.671
Would you come with me?

12:18.806 --> 12:20.407
To see my mom?

12:20.473 --> 12:22.275
I, uh--

12:24.011 --> 12:27.480
Going to see
peoples' parents
is just--

12:27.547 --> 12:29.016
It's too intimate.

12:29.082 --> 12:31.819
I'm not-- I'm not ready
for that right now.

12:33.486 --> 12:34.687
I get that.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.389
I admire that.

12:36.456 --> 12:37.690
Boundaries, right?

12:37.825 --> 12:39.827
- Yep.
- We need boundaries.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.495
And you have
some great boundaries.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.531
They're hot.

12:44.597 --> 12:46.466
You have
hot boundaries.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.734

Get on your knees.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.586
Pull that up.

14:16.823 --> 14:17.991
This'll do.

14:21.929 --> 14:23.230
[smacking]

14:24.064 --> 14:25.232
[smacking]

14:27.434 --> 14:29.202
Thanks.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.337
Oh, hip.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.172
Easier than
dealing with cash.

14:32.239 --> 14:35.842
Yeah,
cash is so dirty.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.010
See you next week,
Sarah.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.979
Okay. Thanks, Pony.

14:42.415 --> 14:43.550
[knocking]

14:45.185 --> 14:47.654
- Hey.
- Hey, yourself.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.122
Is my mom home?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.124
Oh, she's out
getting a haircut.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.826
Right.
Um, can I come in?

14:53.961 --> 14:55.795
Sure.

14:55.862 --> 14:57.730
Yeah, so, um,
it's official.

14:57.797 --> 15:00.433
I am no longer
a career undergrad.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.969
Diploma's in the mail.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.603
Well, that is tremendous.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.606
That's great, sprout, I'm--
I am-- I'm proud of you.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.575
Thank you.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.743
It's kind of weird.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.480
Big change.

15:13.546 --> 15:16.649
Plus, I'm still recovering
from Idlewild.

15:16.716 --> 15:18.318
[chuckles]
Is that normal?

15:18.385 --> 15:21.421
Uh, well, you know,
it kind of depends on
the year.

15:21.488 --> 15:25.825
I mean, sometimes
the Idlewild hangover
can take a few days,

15:25.892 --> 15:28.495
and sometimes
it can take a few weeks,

15:28.561 --> 15:31.598
and then my Red Bull budget,
man, just goes right--

15:31.664 --> 15:33.000
right through the roof.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.804
Is Maura okay?

15:37.870 --> 15:39.039
I don't know.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.040
I think she will be.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.042
- But--
- Yeah?

15:42.109 --> 15:44.877
Yeah, I just,
I guess--

15:45.012 --> 15:46.479
Wish I'd known.
You know?

15:46.546 --> 15:48.448
About the divisiveness
in that whole community.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.117
Yeah, well, I--
[clears throat]

15:50.183 --> 15:52.419
I would have told you
if-- if you'd told me

15:52.485 --> 15:54.354
that night
you were bringing her.

15:54.421 --> 15:57.357
Yeah. But it actually
kind of relates to

15:57.424 --> 15:59.126
what I've been
thinking about, you know,

15:59.192 --> 16:03.496
this whole pain and anxiety
that's just been passed down

16:03.563 --> 16:06.233
through the generations,
and not just the Holocaust,

16:06.299 --> 16:08.101
or the pogroms
or the Jew shoes,

16:08.168 --> 16:10.103
it's just sort of
more like, uh--

16:10.170 --> 16:12.172
like metaphorical
Holocaust.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.473
- It's--
- Ali.

16:13.540 --> 16:15.475
You don't have to
perform for me.

16:16.876 --> 16:18.811
I'm--

16:18.878 --> 16:20.847
I'm not,
I didn't--

16:20.913 --> 16:22.815
I didn't know that I was.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.117
Just be yourself.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.087
Okay.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.061
I want you to be
one of my TAs next year.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.595
Oh, my God, really?

16:38.298 --> 16:39.499
Thank you.
That's great.

16:39.566 --> 16:40.800
That's great.

16:40.867 --> 16:45.205
Um, but let me just--
Let me just toss an idea
at you.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.340
- Okay.
- Okay?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.843
You and I,
we-- we really--

16:50.910 --> 16:52.979
we had some fun
at the fest.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.682
Did we not?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.550
Mm-hm.
Yes, we did.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.687
I-- I didn't know if
we were gonna bring that up.

17:00.753 --> 17:04.291
- It's up.
- Okay.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.393
Honestly, you are--
you're-- you're someone

17:06.459 --> 17:10.130
that I would really
like to take my time with.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.599
I would really...

17:12.665 --> 17:15.135
like to take my time
getting to know.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.809
But it's against the
faculty code of conduct

17:22.875 --> 17:25.212
for professors
to fuck students.

17:25.278 --> 17:27.547
Mm. Even their
grad students.

17:27.614 --> 17:30.817
[chuckles]
Even grad students.

17:30.883 --> 17:35.788
So, take your pick.

17:35.855 --> 17:39.192
You want to be my student,

17:39.259 --> 17:41.261
or you want to be
my old lady?

17:50.237 --> 17:53.140
Band's good.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.474
Really good.

17:54.541 --> 17:59.479
Goin' on tour.
Eight different cities.

17:59.546 --> 18:02.182
You learn more by traveling
with somebody for two days

18:02.249 --> 18:04.551
than you do knowing them
for two years.

18:05.518 --> 18:08.555
Um, what about
you and Mom?

18:08.621 --> 18:12.159
You guys seem to be
getting pretty close
pretty quick.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.426
That's true.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.330
You okay with that?

18:17.397 --> 18:20.633
Of course.
I mean...

18:20.700 --> 18:22.202
I think so.

18:22.269 --> 18:26.939
I mean, is it--
It's not really
my business, right?

18:27.006 --> 18:29.075
Yeah, it is.

18:29.176 --> 18:31.778
It's important to me
what you think.

18:31.844 --> 18:35.248
[bird squawking]

18:35.315 --> 18:37.217
What was that?

18:37.284 --> 18:38.518
I don't know.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.021
Is that a goose?

18:42.088 --> 18:43.256
It's a duck.

18:43.323 --> 18:47.093
Uh, hang on.
Take your jacket off.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.961
Yeah, take it off.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.298
- Shh, shh.
- Why?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.532
Hold it out like
a shock blanket.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.833
Like--
like in front of you.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.035
Hold it out.
Stretch it out
in front of you.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.938
- Like this?
- Good, yeah, now you're
gonna wrap it around him

18:59.005 --> 19:02.842
so he can't flap his wings
so he doesn't hurt himself,
okay?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.211
- Okay.
- Easy.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.078
- You want me to carry him?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.680
Yeah, yeah,
that's good.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.949
Okay, let's get him
out of here.

19:10.016 --> 19:11.784
Keep him safe.

19:11.851 --> 19:12.819
Okay.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.527
Ali:
I'm really sorry.

19:22.429 --> 19:25.232
I'm sorry, um--
I'm really sorry.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.566
What are you
sorry about?

19:26.633 --> 19:29.236
I'm sorry about
the weekend.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.671
I wouldn't have
brought you if I'd known.

19:37.810 --> 19:39.011
I--

19:39.078 --> 19:40.447
I think I might study.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.549
With Leslie in the Fall.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.650
Oh.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.619
You know,
I don't know Leslie,

19:46.686 --> 19:49.856
and I don't know the people
in the Gender Studies program,

19:49.922 --> 19:53.293
but I suggest, uh,

19:53.360 --> 19:55.462
it's always wise to
steer clear of people

19:55.528 --> 19:58.931
who are overly
attached to dogma.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.936
But that's--
that's me.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.638
Okay.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.974
You okay?

20:11.010 --> 20:12.512
I'm nervous.

20:18.985 --> 20:20.620
How do I look?

20:20.687 --> 20:22.589
Pretty.

20:25.792 --> 20:28.194
Deep breaths.

20:28.261 --> 20:31.298
Yep. Rose Pfefferman.

20:31.364 --> 20:34.100
- Okay?
- Yeah.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.402
Okay.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.415
Mom.

21:04.130 --> 21:05.932
Hi, Mom.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.400
It's Morty.

21:17.209 --> 21:21.681
They call me--
They call me Maura now.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.450
Maura.

21:30.222 --> 21:31.658
Hi, Mom.

21:36.228 --> 21:37.364
You know Ali.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.031
[door opens]

21:41.968 --> 21:43.403
Hey, Bri.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.278
Woman:
1139 Soto.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.113
1139 Soto.

21:54.180 --> 21:55.982
1139 Soto.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.985
1139--

21:59.051 --> 22:00.720
There it is.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.855
- Sure you want to go in?
- Yeah.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.759
He might be paralyzed,
he might be crippled.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.728
He better be
fucking crippled.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.400
[knocking]

22:13.400 --> 22:14.601
Oh. How do I look?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.202
- You look pretty.
- No, I don't.

22:16.268 --> 22:18.438
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.
Stop it.

22:21.541 --> 22:24.411
Yes, I am--
I'm looking for Chaim.

22:24.444 --> 22:25.645
Who are you?

22:25.712 --> 22:28.981
I am his wife.
This is his daughter.

22:29.048 --> 22:29.849
Who are you?

22:29.916 --> 22:32.018
- Chaim.
- You are also his wife?

22:32.084 --> 22:35.522
[speaking Hebrew]

22:35.588 --> 22:38.458
Hi, baby,
you made it.

22:38.525 --> 22:39.992
On our own
we made it.

22:40.059 --> 22:41.461
No thanks to you.

22:41.528 --> 22:42.595
You're lucky
we found you.

22:42.662 --> 22:44.597
We had no idea
how to find you.

22:44.664 --> 22:45.798
Well, I gave your mama
my address.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.667
You lie to her.
You lie to her!

22:47.734 --> 22:50.437
She still loves you.
Don't lie.

22:50.437 --> 22:52.772
- Where's Gershon?
- He stayed behind.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.508
He stayed be--
What you couldn't
get him a visa?

22:55.575 --> 22:57.744
What, you can't--
You can't nothing him.

22:57.810 --> 22:58.911
You couldn't
get him a visa?

22:58.978 --> 23:01.280
You can't any--
Who is this, huh?

23:01.448 --> 23:02.314
Who are they?

23:02.449 --> 23:03.916
- Muriel.
- Muriel,

23:03.983 --> 23:06.352
did you know
that he promised to
find us a home?

23:06.453 --> 23:08.154
Hm? To send for us?

23:10.056 --> 23:14.594
Rosie, I am still your tate.
I will always be your father.

23:14.661 --> 23:18.364
You like books, right?
There's a book store.
I'll buy you a book.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.533
Hm? Huh?
Yeah?

23:20.600 --> 23:25.037
About a knight, hm?
Or about, uh, what, what?

23:25.104 --> 23:26.806
Sewing? Hm?

23:28.541 --> 23:30.810
France? Huh?
[chuckles]

23:30.877 --> 23:32.244
I just don't want you
to look at me

23:32.311 --> 23:33.613
the way you're
looking at me right now.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.484
Can you-- can you not--
Can you look away?

23:37.550 --> 23:38.518
[baby crying]

23:38.585 --> 23:41.153
Rosie, please. Please?

23:41.220 --> 23:43.890
Can you look away?

23:43.956 --> 23:46.325
Stop looking at me
the way you're
looking at me right now.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.961
- It's okay, it's all right.
- Can you look away?

23:49.028 --> 23:51.030
[baby crying]

23:51.097 --> 23:52.499
[speaking Hebrew]

23:52.499 --> 23:54.133
[spitting]

23:58.404 --> 23:59.506
[knocking]

23:59.572 --> 24:00.907
- Yes, come in.
- Hello?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.175
Where--
What are you doin'?

24:03.242 --> 24:04.944
- What are you doing?
- I'm-- I'm sorry.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.278
I'm a little late.

24:06.345 --> 24:07.914
You're not a little late,
you're a lot late.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.049
I was on the 405,
there was an accident.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.918
What can I tell ya?

24:11.984 --> 24:14.020
My meetings got pushed,
so it's no big deal.

24:14.086 --> 24:15.154
Perfect.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.090
I finally sold that
Creative Campus on Skid Row.

24:18.157 --> 24:21.127
Oh. Good for you.

24:21.193 --> 24:23.763
Gentrification
wins again.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.765
- What are these chairs?
- We just got these.

24:25.832 --> 24:27.567
They're so low.
I mean, look.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.168
That's the idea.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.838
- Well, they're designed--
- They're terrible.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.706
No, it's a specific thought
in mind to make--

24:33.773 --> 24:34.741
This Melanie's idea?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.208
It was one of her ideas.

24:36.275 --> 24:38.410
I got something.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.146
This is why I'm here.

24:41.648 --> 24:44.316
I present...

24:44.383 --> 24:45.451
restitution.

24:45.552 --> 24:46.853
What is it?

24:46.919 --> 24:50.422
This is a $485
color palette.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.924
- I knew it was you.
- Okay.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.693
- I knew it was you.
- Well, anyway,

24:53.760 --> 24:55.294
- I'm sorry.
- You're so stupid.

24:55.361 --> 24:57.664
It was an accident, though.
Like, I didn't mean to take it.

24:57.730 --> 25:00.667
I was just admiring it,
and then it fell--

25:00.733 --> 25:02.034
Anyway, I'm sorry.

25:02.101 --> 25:05.271
Well, did you get
a gift receipt?

25:06.906 --> 25:07.707
Why?

25:07.774 --> 25:10.409
Melanie, uh--

25:10.476 --> 25:11.744
Ditched me.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.080
What do you mean?
She's, like, gone?

25:14.146 --> 25:16.683
She said something about
she thought that

25:16.749 --> 25:19.085
she rushed into
this relationship,

25:19.151 --> 25:22.388
or that I might just be
too boring for her.

25:22.454 --> 25:24.390
What?
What a bitch.

25:24.456 --> 25:25.992
You're not boring.

25:26.058 --> 25:30.329
[sighs]
It's just a bummer.
It's like--

25:30.396 --> 25:32.599
Well, I'm sorry.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.103
[sighs]

25:40.272 --> 25:42.208
Nothing's adding up.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.345
It's like I thought stuff
would add up by now,

25:46.412 --> 25:49.616
but it's like everything's
slipping through.

25:49.616 --> 25:52.184
Can I say something?

25:52.251 --> 25:53.620
Yeah.

25:53.686 --> 25:58.190
Well, it-- it seems pretty
clear to me that, uh...

25:58.257 --> 26:00.760
you're in shock.

26:00.827 --> 26:03.329
- I am?
- Yeah.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.631
About what?

26:04.697 --> 26:09.235
Well, lots of things,
but mostly I'd say

26:09.301 --> 26:11.270
the loss of your father.

26:11.337 --> 26:14.173
What do you mean?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.843
Joshua, your father died.

26:16.909 --> 26:21.147
I mean, I see Mop
all the time.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.084
You know.

26:25.151 --> 26:27.654
I mean, when somebody dies,
you can't really see them, so--

26:27.720 --> 26:30.723
Maura is not Mort.

26:30.790 --> 26:35.294
Yeah, but I--
I did not like him.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.063
So?

26:37.129 --> 26:40.566
Why, you think
I still miss Mort?

26:40.667 --> 26:41.801
What do you think?

26:41.868 --> 26:44.070
Well, it's like
politically incorrect

26:44.136 --> 26:48.174
to say that you miss someone
who has transitioned, so--

26:48.240 --> 26:50.176
This isn't about correct.

26:50.242 --> 26:52.812
Joshua, this is--

26:52.879 --> 26:55.682
This is about grieving.
Mourning.

26:55.748 --> 26:59.686
Have you grieved and mourned
the loss of your father?

27:01.954 --> 27:03.555
Him? Like losing him?

27:03.690 --> 27:06.058
No, I'm-- I don't know
how to do that.

27:20.840 --> 27:23.309
That's okay.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.044
[sniffling]

27:25.111 --> 27:27.747
[sobbing]

- Hi.
- Hi.

27:48.267 --> 27:49.235
Hi.

27:51.603 --> 27:53.339
Hi.

27:53.405 --> 27:54.373
Do you have a minute?

28:26.605 --> 28:28.574
[panting]

28:28.640 --> 28:30.576
That's it, push.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.111
[grunting]

28:33.379 --> 28:35.982
It's taking too long.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.984
It's taking too long.
I think something's wrong.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.152
Nothing's wrong, Yetta.
Give it a second.

28:40.219 --> 28:43.022
Doctors these days,
they know what they're doing.

28:43.089 --> 28:44.623
She doesn't even
have a name.

28:44.690 --> 28:46.192
Rosie doesn't even
have a name.

28:46.258 --> 28:47.559
I picked out a name.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.829
There's nothin'
to worry about.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.430
I'm gonna call her Fay.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.631
Fay?

28:52.698 --> 28:54.166
Fuh!

28:54.233 --> 28:55.868
- You don't like Fay?
- Fay Pfefferman.

28:55.935 --> 28:58.037
Fay Pfefferman.
It sounds like
a movie star.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.039
What makes you so sure
it's a girl, huh?

29:00.106 --> 29:02.474
Well, a father
knows these things.

29:03.709 --> 29:04.944
- [grunting]
- That's it.

29:05.011 --> 29:09.816
