06:39.579 --> 06:40.579
How do we take him down?

06:40.637 --> 06:43.414
The only way to banish him is
to puncture his demonic core.

06:43.449 --> 06:46.450
In corporeal form,
it's between the T8 and T9 vertebrae,

06:46.486 --> 06:47.486
but it's not that simple.

06:47.520 --> 06:49.287
The core is about
the size of a pea.

06:49.322 --> 06:50.880
Oh, so the entry point's
right below his sternum?

06:50.904 --> 06:51.614
Mm-hmm.

06:51.631 --> 06:53.269
If I can get close
enough, I can kill him.

enough velocity,

the defeat's only temporary.

I was just with Valentine,
and he says that he's Magnus,

20:04.476 --> 20:08.245

some kind of a demonic curse.
