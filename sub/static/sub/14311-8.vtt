WEBVTT

00:08.931 --> 00:11.934
Paging Green Goblin.
Paging Mr. Green Goblin.

00:12.643 --> 00:14.394
I hate it when
the bad guy gets away.

00:14.561 --> 00:15.938
Help. Police.

00:16.104 --> 00:17.689
They've stolen the cars.

00:18.774 --> 00:20.734
We did it.

00:20.901 --> 00:22.569
- Peekaboo.
- Spider-Man!

00:22.736 --> 00:24.238
Don't freak. I'll shake him.

00:25.072 --> 00:26.782
This is how we're playing it?

00:26.949 --> 00:28.617
Oh, I am so out of here.

00:35.874 --> 00:39.211
Since we're stuck here, you might
as well slow this baby down.

00:40.295 --> 00:42.047
She won't stop. I swear.

00:42.214 --> 00:43.882
The hobbit took out the brakes.

00:44.049 --> 00:45.842
We're gonna crash!

01:15.330 --> 01:17.374
You can thank me later, dude.

01:21.169 --> 01:23.338
I'll shake him. I'll shake him!

01:23.505 --> 01:26.133
Isn't this where I came in?

01:26.675 --> 01:28.844
Or maybe this is where I go out.

02:44.670 --> 02:46.630
And that's a wrap.

02:46.797 --> 02:49.758
Okay, not quite as easy as it looked.

02:52.052 --> 02:55.430
<i>Say, hey, what do you say?
Midtown wins the Mustang way</i>

02:55.597 --> 02:57.265
<i>Go, Mustangs!</i>

02:57.432 --> 02:59.267
<i>Score!</i>

03:05.023 --> 03:07.275
<i>Break.
- It's a nail-biter, folks.</i>

03:07.442 --> 03:09.653
<i>The Mustangs are down
by 5 with the ball...</i>

03:09.820 --> 03:12.656
...on <i>their own 40
and six seconds to go.</i>

03:13.490 --> 03:15.659
Hey, tiger, you just getting here?

03:15.826 --> 03:18.370
Yeah, but--
What are you doing here?

03:18.537 --> 03:20.664
- Flash invited me.
- Flash?

03:20.831 --> 03:23.125
<i>Thompson takes the snap,
rolls back...</i>

03:23.291 --> 03:24.626
<i>...and tosses a Hail Mary.</i>

03:31.007 --> 03:33.343
<i>Touchdown!</i>

03:37.097 --> 03:39.349
<i>Harry Osborn makes
an unbelievable catch...</i>

03:39.516 --> 03:41.810
-...to <i>win</i> the <i>game!</i>
- Yay, Harry!

03:41.977 --> 03:46.189
So, M.J., I thought at
the dance that you and me--

03:46.356 --> 03:48.734
- That we--
- Slow down, tiger.

03:48.942 --> 03:52.028
It's not like we're going steady,
or something equally primitive.

03:52.195 --> 03:53.697
We're friends, okay?

03:53.864 --> 03:56.533
- Well, sure, but--
- I'm gonna congratulate Flash.

03:58.869 --> 04:01.621
- Hi, Petey.
- Oh, hey, Liz.

04:01.788 --> 04:02.873
Did you hear?

04:03.039 --> 04:05.041
Everyone's going
to Coney Island tomorrow.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.544
You know, to celebrate the win.

04:07.711 --> 04:09.713
Think maybe you'll come?

04:09.880 --> 04:11.715
Wouldn't miss it.

04:12.215 --> 04:13.717
<i>Osborn.</i>

04:13.884 --> 04:15.469
Burger run. You in?

04:15.635 --> 04:16.887
I'll catch up.

04:28.398 --> 04:30.567
Rand? ls Harry still inside?

04:30.734 --> 04:32.068
Should be right out.

04:32.235 --> 04:36.531
Hey, look. Osborn's got a groupie.

05:00.096 --> 05:02.182
Excuse me, but my friend's
still in there.

05:02.349 --> 05:04.768
Don't think so. Sorry.

05:10.023 --> 05:11.650
But what about the Spider-Man?

05:11.817 --> 05:14.903
He's battled Sandman
and the Rhino.

05:15.529 --> 05:18.073
He could trace them back
to OsCorp. To me.

05:18.240 --> 05:20.575
Enough.
You whine more than my son.

05:22.536 --> 05:25.997
I can't have weak men
in my organization, Otto.

05:26.164 --> 05:27.541
Don't make me get rid of--

05:29.543 --> 05:33.713
<i>Octavius? Are you in there?</i>

05:33.880 --> 05:35.966
Yes, I'm sorry.

05:36.132 --> 05:38.760
<i>- I'll</i> do what I'm told.
- That's all I ask.

05:38.927 --> 05:42.639
Now, run your experiments
like a good Dr. Octopus.

05:42.806 --> 05:46.268
Mr. Osborn, please, I've told you.
That name is so...

05:46.560 --> 05:48.311
...demeaning.

05:52.274 --> 05:54.317
<i>Safety key has been removed.</i>

05:54.484 --> 05:57.487
<i>Experiment will not commence
until key is reinserted.</i>

06:10.584 --> 06:12.335
<i>Safety key reinserted.</i>

06:12.502 --> 06:14.045
<i>Experiment may now commence.</i>

06:14.212 --> 06:16.506
<i>Warning: safety key engaged.</i>

06:16.673 --> 06:18.508
<i>Safety protocols initiated.</i>

06:18.842 --> 06:21.678
<i>Experiment will commence
in 30 seconds.</i>

06:21.845 --> 06:25.891
<i>Warning: electro-magnetic emitters
are set to exceed risk parameters.</i>

06:31.354 --> 06:33.815
Who's in there?
Who turned that key?

06:33.982 --> 06:36.568
Please, you have to stop. I'm inside!

06:36.735 --> 06:39.696
<i>Experiment will commence
in five seconds.</i>

06:39.863 --> 06:43.074
<i>- Four. Three. Two.
- No. No, this is not</i> right.

06:43.241 --> 06:45.118
- No, not right!
- One. Zero.

06:49.623 --> 06:53.209
I've been good.

07:22.781 --> 07:24.157
That's OsCorp.

07:24.324 --> 07:25.992
Harry's dad could be in trouble.

07:26.159 --> 07:30.080
But even at web-slinging speed,
it could take me a while to get there.

07:32.666 --> 07:35.043
Been wanting to try this.

07:47.931 --> 07:51.017
- What the devil's going on?
- It's Dr. O, sir. He's down.

07:51.184 --> 07:53.812
- But the doors are sealed shut--
- Out of my way.

07:53.979 --> 07:58.316
<i>Security override NO-1 engaged.</i>

08:01.820 --> 08:03.571
Octavius?

08:03.738 --> 08:04.948
Doctor?

08:05.115 --> 08:07.117
Where are you--? Otto.

08:07.283 --> 08:08.702
I got it.

08:14.833 --> 08:16.167
Is he...?

08:16.334 --> 08:18.628
He has a pulse, sir.
But it looks as if--

08:18.795 --> 08:22.632
As if his harness
has fused to his skin.

08:24.134 --> 08:26.136
Otto? Otto, are you there?

08:26.302 --> 08:29.639
<i>I can't have weak men
in my organization, Otto.</i>

08:29.806 --> 08:32.976
<i>Can't have weak men. Weak men.</i>

08:33.143 --> 08:37.313
I will not be weak.

08:37.480 --> 08:39.232
Otto, get up--

08:40.357 --> 08:43.528
Silence, you imperious moron!

08:43.736 --> 08:45.196
Whoa, whoa, there, Slinky.

08:45.363 --> 08:47.699
Mr. Osborn here
helped save your life.

08:47.866 --> 08:49.534
YQU!

08:54.664 --> 08:57.208
For the record,
I helped save your life too.

08:57.375 --> 09:00.879
Do not insult my intelligence, hero.

09:01.046 --> 09:03.882
You tracked me down
and tried to destroy me.

09:04.049 --> 09:05.759
As I knew you would.

09:06.634 --> 09:09.512
Destroy you?
Pal, I don't even know you.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.723
Oh, but I survived.

09:11.890 --> 09:15.351
And more to the point,
I have improved.

09:15.518 --> 09:18.063
I am now one with my arms.

09:18.229 --> 09:20.023
Oh, you failed, Spider-Man.

09:20.190 --> 09:24.069
And your failure
has given me new life.

09:29.699 --> 09:32.535
- Otto.
- Not Otto.

09:32.702 --> 09:35.038
Otto Octavius was weak.

09:35.205 --> 09:39.542
Call me Dr. Octopus.

09:44.631 --> 09:46.716
Look, doc, you thought this through?

09:46.883 --> 09:50.887
The next Spider-Man who finds you
might view this as a cautionary tale.

09:51.054 --> 09:57.352
Glib does not equate
with clever, Spider-Man.

09:57.519 --> 10:01.481
Yeah, well, the ratio of arms to sanity
hasn't exactly been established either.

10:01.648 --> 10:04.984
Do you ever shut up?

10:06.694 --> 10:08.238
Sorry, no.

10:08.404 --> 10:11.908
My fans expect a certain amount
of quippage in every battle.

10:12.075 --> 10:14.661
Mr. Osborn, shouldn't we
be helping Spider-Man?

10:14.828 --> 10:16.913
Knock yourself out.

10:17.914 --> 10:21.167
Come on, doc.
You're a cephalopod, I'm an arthropod.

10:21.334 --> 10:22.752
Can't we just hug it out?

10:30.677 --> 10:32.929
You're slowing down, arachnid.

10:33.096 --> 10:35.348
But my arms never tire.

10:35.515 --> 10:38.434
And soon they'll crush--

10:38.601 --> 10:39.686
An alarm clock too?

10:39.853 --> 10:41.729
Man, those arms come
with all the perks.

10:42.772 --> 10:44.107
My apologies, Spider-Man...

10:44.274 --> 10:48.444
...but I have places to go,
and worlds to conquer.

10:50.780 --> 10:53.741
So your obituary will have
to be written another day.

11:04.586 --> 11:06.713
Paging Dr. Octopus.

11:06.880 --> 11:09.132
As if Goblin wasn't bad enough.

11:17.557 --> 11:19.809
Harry! Harry, are you okay?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.979
- Gwen?
- Harry, what happened?

11:23.146 --> 11:25.732
"Happened"?
Game wiped me out, that's all.

11:25.899 --> 11:28.109
So you took a catnap
on the cement?

11:28.610 --> 11:31.404
Gwen. Look, you know I don't
need a fancy feather bed to--

11:31.571 --> 11:32.947
Harry, get serious.

11:33.114 --> 11:35.074
Please, I'm too beat
for serious tonight.

11:35.241 --> 11:37.660
A bunch of us are
going to Coney Island tomorrow.

11:37.827 --> 11:39.829
Come along. It's been a while.

11:39.996 --> 11:44.209
- And then we'll have a real talk?
- Oh, totally. Okay, well, see you.

11:46.669 --> 11:49.631
Ned, you're already working
the Spider-Man story.

11:49.797 --> 11:51.341
At least you're supposed to be.

11:51.507 --> 11:52.675
No, I am, I am.

11:52.842 --> 11:55.929
But, chief, I think this
Goblin thing's the same story.

11:56.095 --> 11:57.513
I feel it in my gut.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.265
You think? You feel?

11:59.432 --> 12:01.809
That's reason enough
to give Goblin to Foswell.

12:01.976 --> 12:04.520
Foswell. Lee.
Am I paying you to hide in here?

12:04.687 --> 12:07.690
Never mind. What do you think
of my son, Colonel John Jameson?

12:07.857 --> 12:10.151
He's a modern-day American hero.

12:10.318 --> 12:13.863
That's what I like about you, Foswell.
You're an objective journalist.

12:14.030 --> 12:16.532
Hop on a plane, coach,
and get down to the Cape...

12:16.699 --> 12:18.451
...to cover my son's shuttle launch.

12:18.618 --> 12:21.037
Now, go. Come on. Go!

12:23.289 --> 12:26.709
Fine. Green Goblin and Spidey.

12:33.299 --> 12:37.804
I cannot believe I once lived
in this anemic hovel.

12:38.513 --> 12:41.391
Well, no more.

12:41.557 --> 12:45.061
And no more, "Yes, Mr. Osborn.
I'm sorry, Mr. Osborn.

12:45.228 --> 12:46.813
Please, Mr. Osborn."

12:46.980 --> 12:49.148
How I groveled before that man.

12:49.691 --> 12:52.151
But soon the whole world
shall grovel...

12:52.318 --> 12:56.364
...before the genius
that is Dr. Octopus.

12:57.573 --> 12:59.701
But first I require
a source of power...

12:59.867 --> 13:02.161
...that will not abandon me
mid-battle.

13:05.081 --> 13:07.834
This will do for the short term.

13:08.001 --> 13:10.420
Oh, but I need
a more permanent solution...

13:10.586 --> 13:15.174
...to guarantee the Spider-Man's
destruction.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.770
- Yes!
- Where do you hide the muscle?

13:27.937 --> 13:30.523
- Harry?
- Gwen. Glad you could make it.

13:30.690 --> 13:33.943
- So, guys, corn dogs? My treat.
- Harry, wait.

13:34.110 --> 13:36.612
- Hey, Gwen.
- Oh, Peter, I'm glad you're here.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.740
Something's really weird with Harry.

13:38.906 --> 13:40.408
And this surprises you?

13:42.118 --> 13:44.454
Okay, okay, not the look.

13:44.620 --> 13:47.415
I mean, sure, the football
thing's gone to his head.

13:47.582 --> 13:51.294
But look at him.
He's a walking commercial for happy.

13:51.461 --> 13:53.296
- It isn't that--
- Hi, Gwen.

13:53.463 --> 13:54.964
Mind if I borrow Petey?

13:55.131 --> 13:57.967
Don't worry, Gwen. Harry's fine.

14:45.681 --> 14:47.934
I guess I got sticky fingers.

14:51.437 --> 14:53.815
Is it me, or is this awkward?

14:53.981 --> 14:55.274
What's that?

15:03.157 --> 15:05.618
Look, sorry. All that sugar.
My stomach.

15:05.785 --> 15:08.496
I gotta go. Don't follow.

15:08.663 --> 15:10.289
Typical Puny Parker.

15:10.456 --> 15:13.042
Leaves me holding the bag.

15:13.209 --> 15:14.627
No offense, girls.

15:26.347 --> 15:28.808
The old stomping grounds.

15:28.975 --> 15:31.310
Otto? Is that you?

15:31.477 --> 15:32.979
Dr. Twaki.

15:33.479 --> 15:35.565
How nice to see you again.

15:35.731 --> 15:39.193
Now, perhaps you'll recall that
when I was last employed here...

15:39.360 --> 15:43.072
...I was at work on a prototype
long-term power source.

15:43.239 --> 15:45.575
<i>The- The Megan-Pack. But--</i>

15:45.741 --> 15:49.162
My work, and yet, when I departed...

15:49.328 --> 15:51.414
...you took possession of it.

15:51.581 --> 15:55.084
Now, in hindsight,
does that seem quite fair?

15:55.251 --> 15:58.004
It's in R & D. Vault 8.

15:58.171 --> 16:01.090
My lucky number.

16:05.761 --> 16:08.931
Like an old friend.

16:09.098 --> 16:11.726
Gangway. Coming through.

16:11.893 --> 16:13.227
Spider-Man.

16:13.603 --> 16:15.897
Hey, doc. Love the new look.

16:16.063 --> 16:18.107
Hand over the device.

16:18.274 --> 16:20.234
I'm thinking, no.

16:20.401 --> 16:22.778
Then you invite your doom.

16:22.987 --> 16:25.573
You're in an enclosed space,
web-slinger.

16:26.782 --> 16:29.494
Where can you hide?

16:40.505 --> 16:45.510
You will suffer for this indignity,
Spider-Man.

16:47.345 --> 16:49.680
Hi. In a hurry,
being chased by multi-armed guy.

16:49.847 --> 16:51.182
Wants this. What is it?

16:51.349 --> 16:53.518
<i>The Megan-Pack. A power source.</i>

16:53.684 --> 16:56.145
Holds a sizable charge
for years at a time.

16:57.188 --> 16:58.564
Thanks. You should hide now.

16:58.731 --> 17:00.733
Spider-Man!

17:02.068 --> 17:04.319
<i>Old daddy longlegs needs power.</i>

17:04.487 --> 17:08.574
<i>Which explains his alarm back at
OsCorp and why he took off so fast.</i>

17:08.741 --> 17:12.036
<i>So all I have to do is play keep-away
until his tank's on empty.</i>

17:12.203 --> 17:13.996
<i>No sweat.</i>

17:18.542 --> 17:21.878
Okay. Maybe a little sweat.

17:22.547 --> 17:24.882
Quiet! We're finally getting started.

17:25.049 --> 17:27.093
<i>After hours of delay...</i>

17:27.676 --> 17:29.095
<i>...we have lift-off.</i>

17:29.262 --> 17:30.763
Go, Johnny!

17:30.972 --> 17:33.182
That's my boy.

17:33.349 --> 17:35.726
Stop that, Miss Brant.
I'm a married man.

17:38.980 --> 17:41.399
- Look out.
- Man. Watch out.

17:42.358 --> 17:45.027
And now back to our
regularly-scheduled chaos.

18:00.251 --> 18:02.378
<i>A guy could get used to this.</i>

18:03.087 --> 18:04.422
Thanks for the company.

18:04.589 --> 18:07.258
Love to stay, but I've got
a doctor's appointment.

18:09.802 --> 18:12.555
Doc, your bedside manner stinks.

18:23.608 --> 18:29.405
Hand over the device, you pathetic
four-limbed excuse for a spider.

18:29.572 --> 18:31.282
Oh, you sweet-talker you.

19:02.188 --> 19:04.440
- Don't worry, Spidey, I got your back.
- No!

19:07.985 --> 19:09.278
Appreciate the help, fanboy.

19:09.445 --> 19:11.822
Keep clear.
You're not pretty enough to save twice.

19:11.989 --> 19:13.199
Right. Right.

19:13.366 --> 19:15.368
Smack him one for me.

19:21.666 --> 19:24.669
I should have seen it sooner,
Spider-Man. You're weak.

19:25.002 --> 19:28.839
- You can't bear to see anyone hurt.
- I could learn to make an exception.

19:29.006 --> 19:32.885
And your meager thought process
is so transparent:

19:33.094 --> 19:35.554
Stall until his power runs out.

19:35.721 --> 19:39.183
But this pack has another hour
of juice at least.

19:39.350 --> 19:42.853
And think of all the damage
I can do in one hour.

19:43.020 --> 19:45.898
Starting with the girl.

19:53.739 --> 19:55.157
Choose:

19:55.324 --> 19:57.535
The device or the girl.

20:01.706 --> 20:03.874
You want it? Then fetch.

20:05.167 --> 20:07.378
Oh, help! Help!

20:10.047 --> 20:11.507
Somebody!

20:12.216 --> 20:14.844
<i>Subway to Coney Island: 2 bucks.</i>

20:15.010 --> 20:16.721
<i>Riding turbulence: 6.</i>

20:16.887 --> 20:19.056
<i>Saving Liz Allan: priceless.</i>

20:22.351 --> 20:25.896
- Finally, it's mine.
- You won't get the chance to use it.

20:26.063 --> 20:27.732
Not as long as I'm conscious.

20:27.898 --> 20:29.775
A situation easily remedied.

20:42.079 --> 20:43.414
As I was saying...

21:08.272 --> 21:10.316
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

21:10.483 --> 21:13.068
Are you kidding me?
They're breaking up.

21:13.235 --> 21:15.279
Flash Thompson and Liz Allan...

21:15.446 --> 21:17.823
...Midtown's number one
power couple...

21:17.990 --> 21:19.950
...are calling it quits.

21:20.117 --> 21:21.786
And it's all your fault.

21:21.952 --> 21:24.163
Dude. Kudos on the ruthlessness.

21:24.330 --> 21:26.499
What? No. I didn't mean to--

21:28.501 --> 21:30.836
Not now, tiger. Trust me.

21:32.963 --> 21:35.841
Pete. I know it's not the best time,
with the soap opera...

21:36.008 --> 21:38.302
...and the supervillain
and everything...

21:38.469 --> 21:41.639
...but we really need to talk to Harry.
I'm worried about him.

21:42.765 --> 21:45.601
Yeah, yeah, okay.

21:46.143 --> 21:47.478
Where is Harry?

21:53.609 --> 21:57.112
<i>I'm talking about the Green Goblin.</i>

21:57.488 --> 22:00.825
The wacko's attacking
the Big Man's operations.

22:00.991 --> 22:02.993
And as far as we can tell...

22:03.160 --> 22:05.871
...he's using a lot of OsCorp tech.

22:06.038 --> 22:08.165
My tech has been stolen.

22:08.332 --> 22:10.167
I've lost my top scientist.

22:10.334 --> 22:13.671
My lab's destroyed,
and my projects are at risk.

22:13.838 --> 22:16.340
Why would I be behind all that?

22:16.507 --> 22:18.509
Yeah, yeah, okay.

22:18.676 --> 22:22.179
- But the Goblin--
-ls a common enemy.

22:22.346 --> 22:25.683
And our common goal
must be to unmask him...

22:26.267 --> 22:28.769
...before it's too late.
