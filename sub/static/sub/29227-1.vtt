WEBVTT

00:05.240 --> 00:07.239
Previously on The Affair...

00:07.240 --> 00:08.865
Everyone says to you when you're young,

00:08.866 --> 00:11.053
"Who do you love? Love is all you need."

00:11.054 --> 00:14.497
And it sends you into a panic.
At least it did for me.

00:14.498 --> 00:15.884
I got married young.

00:15.885 --> 00:17.738
I had a great girlfriend.
She was beautiful.

00:17.739 --> 00:20.489
She was rich. She was artsy.

00:20.490 --> 00:22.281
I wanted to be beautiful,
rich and artsy,

00:22.282 --> 00:24.184
so I married her. And I loved her.

00:24.185 --> 00:25.322
[Cole] Uh, sorry.

00:25.323 --> 00:27.467
Mr. Solloway, this is my wife, Alison.

00:27.468 --> 00:29.619
- I had a fling.
- Uh, with who?

00:29.620 --> 00:30.865
[Helen] Alison?

00:30.866 --> 00:31.871
[Noah] I love you.

00:31.872 --> 00:33.341
I love you, too.

00:33.342 --> 00:34.774
[Noah] I have to leave.

00:34.775 --> 00:36.073
I'm in love with someone else.

00:36.074 --> 00:38.197
Get out! Get out!

00:38.198 --> 00:41.042
[Alison] I read your
book, Noah. I'm sex?

00:41.043 --> 00:42.531
No marriage could survive me?

00:42.532 --> 00:44.619
You make it seem like
I-I came on to you,

00:44.620 --> 00:46.990
like I practically threw myself at you.

00:46.991 --> 00:49.031
Hey, Cole?

00:49.032 --> 00:50.573
Can you just stay?

00:50.574 --> 00:52.821
[Noah] Maybe this was the mistake.

00:52.822 --> 00:53.907
No, please, don't say that.

00:53.908 --> 00:56.254
I had this stupid idea,

00:56.255 --> 00:59.531
that you and I could make a
new start together and...

00:59.532 --> 01:01.866
all the pain we caused everybody else,

01:01.867 --> 01:05.447
it was for a reason, because
we were meant to be together.

01:05.447 --> 01:09.861
I never thought it would
be all... pointless.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.990
[crashing]

01:15.991 --> 01:18.406
- [grunting]
- [Helen] It was a deer.

01:18.407 --> 01:20.031
It was a deer!

01:20.032 --> 01:22.447
Don't! Noah! Noah!

01:22.448 --> 01:23.948
[Noah] Alison, if I don't do something,

01:23.949 --> 01:25.197
they're gonna convict me.

01:25.198 --> 01:26.489
[Alison] I know, just...

01:26.490 --> 01:28.447
Just tell the truth.

01:28.448 --> 01:31.322
Your Honor... I'm guilty.
I killed Scott Lockhart.

01:31.323 --> 01:33.364
- [gallery gasping, murmuring]
- What the hell are you doing?!

01:33.365 --> 01:35.531
- Sit down and stay there.
- [gavel banging]

01:35.532 --> 01:37.155
[Alison] When you get out,
you may still think

01:37.156 --> 01:38.947
you have me to come home to.

01:38.948 --> 01:41.956
And what you're trying to
tell me is I-I-I won't.

01:41.957 --> 01:43.197
I'm sorry.

01:43.198 --> 01:44.407
Hey.

01:46.163 --> 01:48.090
I operated on your son.

01:48.917 --> 01:51.281
Oh, God. Dr. Ullah.

01:51.282 --> 01:52.823
[Margaret] I'm thrilled
for you, darling.

01:52.824 --> 01:54.994
This fellow's quite a catch.

01:54.995 --> 01:57.823
Handsome, polite, a doctor.

01:57.824 --> 01:59.364
[Vik] Do you think she even realizes

01:59.365 --> 02:01.196
- these cans are hers?
- No, I don't.

02:01.197 --> 02:03.781
And she's not going to if you
keep moving them for her.

02:03.782 --> 02:05.157
Hi, Daddy.

02:06.782 --> 02:07.739
[grunts]

02:07.740 --> 02:09.322
Hey.

02:09.323 --> 02:11.782
[chuckling] Hey. Look
at you. You look great.

02:11.783 --> 02:12.949
I have a date.

02:16.584 --> 02:18.073
[Ben] So, what happened to you?

02:18.074 --> 02:19.157
Why'd you stand me up?

02:20.657 --> 02:22.447
Go home to your fucking wife.

02:22.448 --> 02:24.532
- [grunting]
- [yells]

02:26.407 --> 02:28.447
[James] They found her body.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.698
[Noah] She's dead. They're
ruling it a suicide.

02:30.699 --> 02:32.865
- Where is Mommy?
- [Cole] All we have to do is

02:32.866 --> 02:35.106
think about her and
remember her, and that way,

02:35.107 --> 02:37.615
she will always be with us.

02:39.576 --> 02:41.559
Priya?

02:41.560 --> 02:44.052
Vik didn't tell me that
you were coming over.

02:44.053 --> 02:45.906
He told me his pants are falling down,

02:45.907 --> 02:47.383
so I'm taking them in.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.531
I know, I just... I didn't
want to bother you, so...

02:49.532 --> 02:52.948
Why would it bother me to do
something nice for my son?

02:52.949 --> 02:56.532
Does it bother you to care
for your children, Helen?

02:58.426 --> 03:00.156
[Helen] Vik.

03:00.157 --> 03:01.531
Vik!

03:01.532 --> 03:03.281
I'm not getting treatment.

03:03.282 --> 03:04.614
That just doesn't make any sense.

03:04.615 --> 03:06.906
I'm not gonna sit around
and watch you die.

03:06.907 --> 03:09.698
I have pancreatic cancer!

03:09.699 --> 03:12.574
There is no cure. No hope.

03:14.074 --> 03:16.239
Vik? Is that your car?

03:16.240 --> 03:18.447
Yeah, I just got it.

03:18.448 --> 03:20.281
I know the best road in Malibu.

03:20.282 --> 03:22.906
Let's see how fast this
car can really go.

03:22.907 --> 03:25.115
I want to get home, and I want to drink.

03:25.116 --> 03:27.948
- [Helen] You're pregnant?
- [Sierra] Yes.

03:27.949 --> 03:29.447
That's what I was trying to tell you.

03:29.448 --> 03:31.032
Why are you trying to tell me?

03:32.323 --> 03:34.322
I want to keep it. I
want to be a mother.

03:34.323 --> 03:35.698
I don't want to go.

03:35.699 --> 03:39.073
I want... more days. I want more life.

03:39.074 --> 03:40.407
Vik okay?

03:41.615 --> 03:44.076
Vik is going to die.

03:44.077 --> 03:46.614
If there was one person
I would want to be with

03:46.615 --> 03:48.073
when I die,

03:48.074 --> 03:49.448
it'd be you.

05:10.239 --> 05:16.238
_

05:16.239 --> 05:17.447
[indistinct chatter]

05:17.448 --> 05:19.531
[Sasha] I was in a dark place, man.

05:19.532 --> 05:22.589
I just finished the second
film in The Maze franchise,

05:22.590 --> 05:24.991
and I was on top of the
world, but inside...

05:28.240 --> 05:29.823
...I was empty.

05:29.824 --> 05:32.239
So, I looked at my life
and I asked myself,

05:32.240 --> 05:34.322
what's wrong here? What's missing?

05:35.073 --> 05:36.906
Authenticity.

05:36.907 --> 05:38.953
That was the answer. Integrity.

05:38.954 --> 05:41.990
Courage. And that's when
I picked up your book.

05:41.991 --> 05:45.013
[chuckles] And it just
spoke to me, man. It did.

05:45.014 --> 05:48.115
I thought, this is my life.
And this man understands...

05:48.116 --> 05:49.447
everything.

05:49.448 --> 05:52.739
[chuckles] That's, uh, I'm really glad

05:52.740 --> 05:54.906
- you felt that way.
- People don't really know me, you know?

05:54.907 --> 05:56.281
They-they, uh, know my movies.

05:56.282 --> 05:58.239
They see me as this action hero,

05:58.240 --> 06:00.107
this sort of modern-day James Bond.

06:00.108 --> 06:02.961
But that's all an act, of course.
I mean, that's not who I am.

06:02.962 --> 06:06.573
But this book... this is me.

06:06.574 --> 06:09.634
- This is my story.
- Yeah, it's my story, too.

06:09.635 --> 06:11.115
[both chuckle]

06:11.116 --> 06:13.322
I guess, you know, my
story's your story.

06:13.323 --> 06:15.314
I know it's a real act of faith,

06:15.315 --> 06:18.086
putting your work in the hands
of another artist to interpret.

06:18.087 --> 06:19.381
But I want you to know,

06:19.382 --> 06:21.239
I'm not going to let you down.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.675
I've got this. I've got you, okay?

06:23.676 --> 06:26.739
I've been waiting a very, very
long time for something to direct.

06:26.740 --> 06:29.031
So, enough about me, tell me about you.

06:29.032 --> 06:30.863
Tell me about Noah Solloway.
When did you write this?

06:30.864 --> 06:32.049
How many years ago?

06:32.050 --> 06:35.115
Oh, God, uh... I guess
it was eight years ago.

06:35.116 --> 06:36.281
- Eight?
- Mm-hmm.

06:36.282 --> 06:37.990
Mm-hmm. And how did it happen?

06:37.991 --> 06:40.115
I mean, did you just, you just
sat down one day and thought,

06:40.116 --> 06:42.197
[chuckling] "I'm just gonna
write a whole book."

06:42.198 --> 06:45.113
Well, no, no, no. Well,
not exactly. No, um...

06:45.782 --> 06:48.352
Well, I'd-I'd written
a-a book before this.

06:48.353 --> 06:50.239
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it didn't do very well.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.364
- Tragic.
- Right. And, um,

06:52.365 --> 06:54.573
so I was, uh, I was
teaching in Brooklyn.

06:54.574 --> 06:56.601
I love that. That's a great detail.

06:56.602 --> 06:57.614
So human.

06:57.615 --> 07:01.196
- Please go on.
- Uh... yeah, so, uh...

07:02.365 --> 07:04.031
So, teachers, um,

07:04.032 --> 07:06.865
so, teachers get their summers
off, so, uh, my wife and I would

07:06.866 --> 07:09.197
take every summer and take
the kids out to Montauk.

07:09.198 --> 07:11.489
And we'd spend a month with my in-laws.

07:11.490 --> 07:13.573
Let me just, uh, pause
you there for a second.

07:13.574 --> 07:15.476
- Your wife Ellen...
- Helen.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.523
What?

07:16.524 --> 07:18.356
Uh, she's Ellen in the
book, but actually...

07:18.357 --> 07:19.406
That's... doesn't matter.

07:19.407 --> 07:21.739
- She's, uh, wh-what about her?
- She is a great character.

07:21.740 --> 07:23.197
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:23.198 --> 07:25.156
She's funny, she's down-to-earth,

07:25.157 --> 07:27.240
- self-deprecating.
- Right.

07:27.241 --> 07:29.156
So, why did you do it?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.014
- Do what? Have an affair?
- [chuckles] Nah.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.436
No. I get that part.

07:33.437 --> 07:34.823
I mean, that's reasonable, you're a man.

07:34.824 --> 07:37.906
No, the part that I'm struggling
with in telling this story,

07:37.907 --> 07:41.115
the part that I'm struggling
with is, is why you, no,

07:41.116 --> 07:45.573
excuse me, sorry. Why does
Daniel leave his wife?

07:45.574 --> 07:48.475
Well, I mean, it, uh...
well, that's kind of

07:48.476 --> 07:50.698
what the whole book is about.

07:50.699 --> 07:53.197
Yes. I get that. So help me out.

07:53.198 --> 07:56.781
Um... well, I'm not sure there's
an easy answer to that,

07:56.782 --> 07:58.197
to that question, but, um...

07:58.198 --> 07:59.698
I don't know, I was,

07:59.699 --> 08:01.031
I was pretty unhappy.

08:01.032 --> 08:03.531
I reached a certain age
when I felt I should be

08:03.532 --> 08:06.073
more accomplished, more
confident, more wealthy,

08:06.074 --> 08:07.906
just more, really. And...

08:07.907 --> 08:11.698
um, Helen and I had been
college sweethearts.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.031
You know, I loved her,

08:14.032 --> 08:18.197
but... our relationship was, uh...

08:18.198 --> 08:19.698
I guess it just, it seemed to me

08:19.699 --> 08:21.427
that that was what was holding me back.

08:21.428 --> 08:22.429
Mm-hmm.

08:26.615 --> 08:28.698
Is this at all helpful?

08:28.699 --> 08:30.197
Yes, absolutely. Mm-hmm.

08:30.198 --> 08:32.698
So you said you met

08:32.698 --> 08:34.780
- in university, right?
- Yeah, that's right, mm-hmm.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.852
- What was she like?
- Who, Helen at that time?

08:36.854 --> 08:37.905
Mm-hmm.

08:37.907 --> 08:39.739
She was kind of a cool girl.

08:39.740 --> 08:41.451
She, uh, she grew up

08:41.452 --> 08:44.573
in New York City, she was
up on all the trends,

08:44.574 --> 08:45.628
she knew the bands, and... Excuse me.

08:45.629 --> 08:47.406
Can I get, can I get
some cream in there?

08:47.407 --> 08:49.281
- Of course, sir.
- Thank you.

08:49.282 --> 08:51.739
So the first night you did the dirty,

08:51.740 --> 08:53.406
- [chuckles]
- what song was playing?

08:53.407 --> 08:55.239
- Sorry, what? Uh...
- What-what song was playing?

08:55.240 --> 08:57.239
I mean, you just said she's
into all these bands.

08:57.240 --> 09:00.321
Was it something avant-garde
or new or foreign,

09:00.322 --> 09:01.354
or what was it?

09:01.355 --> 09:04.865
[chuckles] Uh... Springsteen.
I think Tunnel of Love

09:04.866 --> 09:06.490
had just come out...

09:07.407 --> 09:08.656
Uh, S-Springsteen.

09:08.657 --> 09:11.614
[quietly] Springsteen. I love that.

09:11.615 --> 09:15.990
Anyway, uh... uh, sorry,
what were we talking about?

09:15.991 --> 09:17.489
Why you left your wife.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.152
Right, yeah, so, um...

09:20.710 --> 09:22.420
so, anyway, I, um...

09:24.089 --> 09:27.115
I... I met this, uh, another woman,

09:27.116 --> 09:29.239
who, um, and I fell in love with her,

09:29.240 --> 09:31.573
and she seemed to be everything
that my wife wasn't.

09:31.574 --> 09:33.739
I come from a family of alcoholics.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.073
Oh. I'm sorry.

09:36.074 --> 09:37.447
Thank you.

09:37.448 --> 09:39.906
I thought I'd avoided it.

09:39.907 --> 09:41.657
I thought the gene
skipped right over me,

09:41.658 --> 09:44.649
'cause I've never had a problem
with controlled substances.

09:44.650 --> 09:47.798
So it wasn't until years
later that I realized

09:47.799 --> 09:52.213
that I was an addict...
for toxic relationships.

09:54.240 --> 09:55.782
[groans]

09:56.657 --> 09:58.781
- Fuck me.
- What's wrong?

09:58.782 --> 10:01.656
[groans] I just can't
stand coffee with cream.

10:01.657 --> 10:02.781
It's like a drink for children.

10:02.782 --> 10:04.948
Well, anyway, that's why I was

10:04.949 --> 10:06.156
drawn to your book.

10:06.157 --> 10:07.990
And the Alison character.

10:07.991 --> 10:10.492
I get it.

10:10.493 --> 10:12.000
I totally get it.

10:20.365 --> 10:22.656
Sorry, wh-what's going
on? Are-are you...?

10:22.657 --> 10:24.322
- What do you mean?
- Is...

10:24.323 --> 10:26.156
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

10:26.157 --> 10:27.768
I never do this.

10:27.769 --> 10:29.115
Oh, that's okay.
[chuckling] That's fine.

10:29.116 --> 10:32.250
But I was just wondering if
I could give you my number.

10:32.251 --> 10:34.739
Yeah, sure. That's very kind of you.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.657
- Uh, Sasha.
- I'm Tali.

10:38.657 --> 10:41.197
Oh, I see. You mean business.

10:41.198 --> 10:43.364
[Tali] I just love you
and I'd love to show you

10:43.365 --> 10:45.865
how much I love you. Anytime.

10:45.866 --> 10:48.823
That is so kind of you,
Tali. Thank you so much.

10:48.824 --> 10:51.197
- Thank you.
- Thank you. [chuckles]

10:51.198 --> 10:52.906
Um...

10:52.907 --> 10:55.739
fuck, I hate it when they
write in permanent ink.

10:55.740 --> 10:57.948
Sorry, does-does that, does
that happen to you a lot?

10:57.949 --> 10:59.489
Yeah. Oh, quite often, actually.

10:59.490 --> 11:02.281
Okay, so... [exhales]

11:02.282 --> 11:04.622
we've covered Alison,

11:04.623 --> 11:05.948
- we've covered Helen.
- [phone chiming]

11:05.949 --> 11:08.156
Now, what we haven't covered is...

11:08.157 --> 11:10.197
we haven't discussed the ending.

11:10.198 --> 11:12.531
Uh... the ending?

11:12.532 --> 11:14.374
Mm-hmm. The ending.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.106
So, in your script, it ends... I mean,

11:17.107 --> 11:18.865
he hits her with his car?

11:18.866 --> 11:20.865
Yeah, that's, well, that's,
that's the ending in the book.

11:20.866 --> 11:22.322
Do you love it?

11:22.323 --> 11:23.434
Do I love what?

11:23.435 --> 11:24.489
The ending.

11:24.490 --> 11:26.739
Uh, yeah...?

11:26.740 --> 11:31.406
Yeah, like, "Yeah!" or like,
"Yeah, but I'm not sure."

11:31.407 --> 11:33.406
Sorry, I, uh, I'm having,
uh, I don't understand.

11:33.407 --> 11:35.406
Are you... is-is the ending... the...

11:35.407 --> 11:36.698
Is there something in the ending

11:36.699 --> 11:37.906
that's not working for you, or...

11:37.907 --> 11:39.416
I don't... [chuckles]
I don't understand.

11:41.949 --> 11:44.541
Do you know what? You're great.

11:45.365 --> 11:49.078
You're, you're truly great. And I...

11:49.079 --> 11:51.239
Listen, I just love that
we're doing this together.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.489
- Really, I am.
- Me, too. I just...

11:53.490 --> 11:55.198
- Look, uh, Sasha, I hate to...
- [phone chiming]

11:55.199 --> 11:57.031
Uh, cut this conversation short.

11:57.032 --> 11:58.614
My girlfriend is-is
waiting for me outside.

11:58.615 --> 12:00.115
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, go, go, go.
- So sorry.

12:00.116 --> 12:01.539
We've got tons of time to discuss this.

12:01.540 --> 12:03.656
We're not shooting anything for
three months and... No, no.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.281
I've got this. No, come on. [chuckles]

12:05.282 --> 12:06.823
- I got it.
- Okay, thank you.

12:06.824 --> 12:08.739
Yeah. You look sharp.

12:08.740 --> 12:10.449
Where are you headed? Wedding?

12:10.450 --> 12:13.740
No, no, I'm... a funeral, actually.

12:14.657 --> 12:16.698
[slow, somber music]

12:16.699 --> 12:18.782
♪♪♪

12:38.740 --> 12:41.615
[whispering] It just seems
really out of character.

13:08.964 --> 13:10.948
So what happens now?

13:10.949 --> 13:12.508
We're waiting for our mom.

13:12.509 --> 13:14.342
Then we're going over to the
grave site to bury him.

13:14.343 --> 13:17.322
I thought Hindus cremated their dead.

13:17.323 --> 13:18.739
[Whitney] He was half
Hindu, half Muslim.

13:18.740 --> 13:21.447
He planned his own funeral, so...

13:21.448 --> 13:23.614
he took some stuff from one culture,

13:23.615 --> 13:25.865
- some from the other.
- Ah.

13:25.866 --> 13:27.948
Are you kids hungry at all?

13:27.949 --> 13:29.614
I got some munchies in
the car. We could...

13:29.615 --> 13:30.990
We're fine, Dad.

13:30.991 --> 13:33.098
Okay.

13:37.866 --> 13:40.115
[exhales] Look, I can drive
you guys to the grave site

13:40.116 --> 13:41.698
if you want. That way you don't

13:41.699 --> 13:43.198
have to wait around for Mom.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.035
Any takers?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.303
Look, Dad, why don't you just head back?

13:50.304 --> 13:51.783
We'll see you at the house.

13:53.198 --> 13:54.406
Maybe we should...

13:54.407 --> 13:56.781
Right, right, yeah.

13:56.782 --> 13:59.447
- [chuckling]
- Hey. Hi, Bruce.

13:59.448 --> 14:01.948
Good to see you, Noah.

14:01.949 --> 14:03.239
How are you, Noah?

14:03.240 --> 14:04.406
I'm fine, I'm fine.

14:04.407 --> 14:05.604
It's good to see you both.

14:06.357 --> 14:08.014
This is, uh, this is Janelle.

14:08.407 --> 14:10.990
How nice to meet another
one of Noah's women.

14:10.991 --> 14:13.281
- [chuckles]
- Actually we were both leaving,

14:13.282 --> 14:15.739
so, uh, the kids are gonna
go to the grave site

14:15.740 --> 14:17.656
and we're gonna see everybody
back at the house.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.156
Where is Helen?

14:19.157 --> 14:21.364
- What's going on in there?
- Uh, I think she went

14:21.365 --> 14:22.906
to go talk to Priya about something.

14:22.907 --> 14:24.322
I should go back in
there and check on her.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.948
- Oh, no, I'll go. I'll be...
- No, no, no, no, Margaret, no.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.073
You-you stay with Stacey.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.489
It's okay.

14:28.490 --> 14:30.971
Uh, I'll go, uh,

14:30.972 --> 14:32.323
I'll go see what's happening.

14:33.791 --> 14:37.001
- I'll be right back.
- Uh, okay.

14:39.907 --> 14:42.972
[Helen] Priya, we discussed this.
I showed you the document.

14:42.973 --> 14:45.115
Perhaps, Helen, he didn't
know what you had written.

14:45.116 --> 14:47.073
Oh, for fuck's sake, he dictated it.

14:47.074 --> 14:49.948
I just wrote it down, and I
promised him I would do it.

14:49.949 --> 14:53.364
You can't just ignore his
dying wishes. Are you insane?

14:53.365 --> 14:56.239
His soul cannot be released
unless he's cremated.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.156
He's still here. He's still with us!

14:58.157 --> 14:59.679
He doesn't know he's dead!

14:59.680 --> 15:01.990
- What's going on?
- What are you doing here?

15:01.991 --> 15:03.698
I just, um, I'm checking on you.

15:03.699 --> 15:05.031
[Priya] Listen, Noah,

15:05.032 --> 15:06.781
Vikram cannot be reincarnated

15:06.782 --> 15:10.322
unless he's released from this
body, and this body is dead.

15:10.323 --> 15:12.197
- It is now his prison.
- [Helen] He wanted to be buried.

15:12.198 --> 15:13.731
I told him I would bury him.

15:13.732 --> 15:15.464
That is because he was dying

15:15.465 --> 15:16.865
and you were his caretaker

15:16.866 --> 15:18.489
and he wanted to please you!

15:18.490 --> 15:19.611
That's not true!

15:19.612 --> 15:21.239
Abdul...

15:21.240 --> 15:24.373
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

15:24.374 --> 15:25.578
Helen.

15:26.379 --> 15:27.865
Look, what do we do?

15:27.866 --> 15:29.447
Well, unless there's
some written mandate

15:29.448 --> 15:31.031
from the deceased, it's standard for

15:31.032 --> 15:32.990
his next of kin to decide
what happens to the body.

15:32.991 --> 15:35.273
Oh, no, she-she is, she is his
next of kin. She's his wife.

15:35.274 --> 15:37.330
[whispers] She says
they weren't married.

15:38.179 --> 15:39.688
If he's going to be cremated

15:39.689 --> 15:41.781
by Hindu law, it has to be

15:41.782 --> 15:43.317
in the next few hours.

15:45.403 --> 15:46.822
Hey.

15:46.823 --> 15:48.573
She can't do this. It's
not what he wanted.

15:48.574 --> 15:49.880
I know, I know,

15:49.881 --> 15:51.246
but he's dead, Helen. He doesn't care.

15:51.247 --> 15:53.237
He asked me to bury him.

15:53.238 --> 15:57.025
Right, I get it, it's just...
Look, if he was here right now,

15:57.026 --> 15:58.984
don't you think he'd be trying
to make his mother happy?

15:58.985 --> 16:00.912
That's the whole point. She
bullied him his entire life.

16:00.913 --> 16:02.672
I'm not gonna let her do
it to him in death, too.

16:02.673 --> 16:04.363
You can't win this, Helen.
She's his mother.

16:04.364 --> 16:07.656
You're supposed to be on my side.

16:07.657 --> 16:09.239
And I am, it's just...

16:09.240 --> 16:11.406
Imagine this was one of our
kids and someone was trying

16:11.407 --> 16:13.698
- to tell us how to bury them...
- Shh. Just fuck off, Noah.

16:13.699 --> 16:15.202
- Helen...
- Fuck off.

16:15.961 --> 16:17.069
Do what you want.

16:19.116 --> 16:21.157
[door opens]

16:23.116 --> 16:25.157
[door closes]

16:29.548 --> 16:32.156
They say it's standard
operating procedure that they

16:32.157 --> 16:33.281
would be doing this for anyone

16:33.282 --> 16:36.115
in my position, but
that's just bullshit.

16:36.116 --> 16:38.906
I've already held the
job. The fact that they

16:38.907 --> 16:41.364
are asking me to reapply is...

16:41.365 --> 16:43.739
Yeah, it's-it's crazy.

16:43.740 --> 16:46.839
And humiliating and sexist and racist.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.484
Look, they're just making
you jump through hoops.

16:48.485 --> 16:49.745
You know they're gonna rehire you.

16:49.746 --> 16:52.031
The point is, I shouldn't
have to jump through hoops.

16:52.032 --> 16:53.906
Yeah, right.

16:54.970 --> 16:56.569
[Janelle] Noah, are you even listening?

16:56.570 --> 16:58.896
Sorry, yeah. No. No, I'm here.

16:58.897 --> 17:01.281
Look, I agree with you,
they're treating you badly,

17:01.282 --> 17:02.990
but I think it's just
bureaucracy, you know.

17:02.991 --> 17:05.239
I really don't think it's, uh,
anything personal, Janelle.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.073
Of course. You wouldn't.

17:07.074 --> 17:08.990
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

17:08.991 --> 17:10.991
[sighs]

17:13.406 --> 17:15.064
What do you think this house costs?

17:16.631 --> 17:17.990
I don't know, 2 million?

17:17.991 --> 17:19.973
I don't know, I think
it's more than that.

17:19.974 --> 17:21.909
At least three, maybe four.

17:21.910 --> 17:25.406
Does she even work? Must be nice.

17:25.406 --> 17:27.719
Look, she's been through a lot.

- Ah.

17:32.824 --> 17:34.573
Will you take a look at this view?

17:34.574 --> 17:37.197
Yeah, it's something, isn't it?

17:37.198 --> 17:38.947
You've done well for yourself, Solloway.

17:38.948 --> 17:40.851
I'm man enough to admit that.

17:42.574 --> 17:44.948
- I don't live here, Bruce.
- Huh?

17:44.949 --> 17:47.406
No, th-this is, this is Helen's house.

17:47.407 --> 17:50.197

17:50.198 --> 17:51.865
That's how Margaret feels as well.

- Oh, hello.

17:54.526 --> 17:55.656
Hello.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.253
Uh, can I trouble you for another drink?

17:57.991 --> 17:59.651
- What?
- A brandy.

18:02.477 --> 18:04.531
[chuckles] Of course.

Coming right up.

18:06.947 --> 18:08.197
Janelle, I'm...

18:08.198 --> 18:10.115
I didn't think you had it in you, Noah,

18:10.116 --> 18:11.766
but I was wrong.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.990
Just, uh, will you excuse
me for a second, Bruce?

18:15.867 --> 18:18.531
Janelle. Janelle, I'm sorry, I...

18:18.532 --> 18:21.823
I'm really sorry. It's-it's
not what you think.

18:21.824 --> 18:23.671
- Oh, no?
- No, he's...

18:24.407 --> 18:26.698
- There's something wrong with him.
- There certainly is.

18:26.699 --> 18:28.656
No, he's losing his memory.
He thinks I'm still married

18:28.657 --> 18:30.073
to Helen. He thinks I own this place.

18:30.074 --> 18:32.115
He asked me to get him a drink.

18:32.116 --> 18:33.614
Right, he didn't realize who you are.

18:33.615 --> 18:36.031
He didn't realize he just met you.

18:36.032 --> 18:37.447
Oh, so, because he didn't recognize me,

18:37.448 --> 18:38.774
he just assumes I'm the help?

18:40.699 --> 18:42.698
Right, I guess, uh, that's
not better, but, um...

18:42.699 --> 18:44.239
No, it's not.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.322
[sighs] I need to leave.

18:46.323 --> 18:47.656

- [sighs]

18:47.657 --> 18:49.115
- Hi, Helen.
- Hi.

18:49.116 --> 18:51.073
- Thank you for being here.
