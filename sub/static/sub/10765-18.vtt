00:09.309 --> 00:11.038
-Good morning.
-Good morning, aII.

00:11.111 --> 00:12.100
Good morning.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.442
WeII, here they are. Hot off the presses.

00:14.514 --> 00:17.745
Move over, Kitty KeIIy. Cedric has arrived.

<i>''Through the Keyhole.:</i>
<i>Memoirs of an Embittered Butler. ''</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:26.152
Check this out.
Is it Cedric, or is it Patrick Swayze?

00:28.762 --> 00:33.495
Excuse me, but writing a sordid, steamy,
exposÃ© about the RandoIph famiIy...

00:33.566 --> 00:37.764
is darned offensive, and we won't
have anything to do with that smut.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.400
Oh, get reaI.

00:42.575 --> 00:44.372
May I recommend Chapter 7?

00:44.444 --> 00:47.902
Mr. and Mrs. RandoIph
found it particuIarIy humiIiating.

00:53.019 --> 00:55.954
-Geoffrey, this book is dedicated to you.
-But of course.

00:56.022 --> 00:59.150
It was Geoffrey who
gave me the idea in the first pIace.

00:59.325 --> 01:02.624
By the way, how are your memoirs
coming aIong, oId boy?

01:03.997 --> 01:06.830

01:28.888 --> 01:32.847
WiII, you are burning up.
PhiIip, he reaIIy is sick.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.052
Baby, is it your throat again?

01:35.195 --> 01:39.996
Vivian, don't Iet that boy con you.
There's absoIuteIy nothing wrong with--

01:41.801 --> 01:44.702
Now, you know what the doctor said.
One more throat infection...

01:44.771 --> 01:46.636
and those tonsiIs
have just got to come out.

01:46.706 --> 01:49.174

03:12.025 --> 03:15.461
HeIIo. I'm Vivian Banks.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.894

03:20.700 --> 03:22.998
And where is our brave IittIe soIdier?

03:23.136 --> 03:27.095
I keep teIIing you, I ain't sick. I'm not sick.

03:27.440 --> 03:29.806
Sweetheart, now you know
what Dr. Bennett said.

03:29.876 --> 03:31.867
Those tonsiIs have just got to come out.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.937
-Now there's no reason to be afraid.
-Who are you kidding?

03:35.014 --> 03:38.211
Why do you think they wear masks?
So they can't be identified.

03:39.752 --> 03:41.982
And why do you think they knock you out?

03:42.055 --> 03:45.252
So you don't see them drinking
margaritas over your open stomach.

03:47.560 --> 03:50.654
Sorry I'm Iate.
I had to stop by the gift shop.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.058
Hey, thanks a Iot, HiI, that's reaI nice.

03:53.233 --> 03:56.202
WeII, sometimes a girI
just has to treat herseIf.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.736
Your overnight case, Master WiII.

04:03.810 --> 04:07.837
I've packed everything but
your pajamas. Where do you keep them?

04:07.947 --> 04:10.609
-WeII, I usuaIIy keep them inside the--

04:17.790 --> 04:19.519
I'II just wait in the car.

04:21.293 --> 04:25.230
WiII, this might be a good time
for you to put your John Hancock on this.

04:25.565 --> 04:29.729
''I, WiII Smith, being of sound mind,
do hereby bequeath....''

04:29.836 --> 04:33.363
-Yo, what the heII is this?
-It's your peace of mind, my friend.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.905
Let's say you die.

04:36.609 --> 04:38.338
Do you want just anyone...

04:38.411 --> 04:40.811
to get their hands
on that $323 and 15 cents...

04:40.880 --> 04:44.441

04:45.118 --> 04:47.951
I ain't think about it Iike that.
Can I see that, CarIton?

04:48.121 --> 04:49.281
Sure, WiII.

04:55.028 --> 04:59.089
I hate to break up this HaIImark moment,
but visiting hours are over.

04:59.666 --> 05:02.567
Okay. WeII, you better get some rest,
we better get going.

05:02.635 --> 05:03.795
No, Aunt Viv, no!

05:03.870 --> 05:06.896
PIease can't you just stay one more

Look, there's nothing to worry about.

14:07.279 --> 14:10.305
I've pretended to do this operation
a thousand times.

Look, this time they've given me
a reaI scaIpeI. CooI.

14:26.265 --> 14:29.564
Man, I'm getting out of here
before Dr. HannibaI Lecter shows up.

14:39.511 --> 14:43.504
Doctor, the patient in 214
is not responding to the medication.

14:43.616 --> 14:45.243
What shouId I do?

14:48.954 --> 14:52.651
WeII, Nurse, I'd run a KGB and an NAACP.

Yeah. I'm taIking about Geoffrey's book.

15:55.254 --> 15:59.520
Geoffrey can write whatever he wants.
This famiIy has nothing to hide.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.425
Your father's right. Now I don't want

16:04.029 --> 16:06.930
PhiIip, wouId you heIp me

16:11.704 --> 16:15.401
If Mom and Dad find out what reaIIy goes
on around here, they're going to kiII us.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.271
We've got to get that book.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.634
AII right, aII right.

16:49.241 --> 16:51.869
I hate this part of the job.
It's never for me.

17:06.592 --> 17:09.060
Those memoirs
have got to be in here somewhere.

17:09.328 --> 17:12.729
Okay, AshIey, we're in.
Now hit the dirt and start twitching.

17:14.299 --> 17:16.790
CarIton, we've got to find those memoirs.

17:16.868 --> 17:19.565

why Lou in Better Shoes...

17:19.637 --> 17:21.435

17:21.740 --> 17:24.709
Yeah, what if my friends find out
I sIeep with a hand puppet?

17:37.189 --> 17:38.588
Move over, CarIton.

17:38.657 --> 17:42.024
I don't have any room.
WiII, move over. WiII?

17:44.830 --> 17:47.697

17:50.102 --> 17:53.094
-He's not here, PhiIip, Iet's go.
-Not so quick, Vivian.

17:53.172 --> 17:57.131
Do you reaIIy want HiIary to find out she

18:00.712 --> 18:04.204
WeII, it never wouId have happened

18:17.162 --> 18:21.030

18:23.869 --> 18:25.564

18:29.842 --> 18:32.902
And I hope them concert tickets

18:34.780 --> 18:38.272
Is that why you aIways pIay <i>Hot Fun</i>

18:41.854 --> 18:45.017
-Where was I conceived?
-ProbabIy at a white saIe.

18:47.726 --> 18:51.025
That's enough.
WiII, why aren't you in the hospitaI?

18:51.563 --> 18:54.623
I'm sorry, UncIe PhiI.
I'm scared of going under the knife.

18:54.700 --> 18:58.295
I mean, if I wanted to get cut
I'd Iet Stevie Wonder do my fade.

18:59.171 --> 19:02.072
Sweetheart, I know you're nervous
about this operation...

19:02.141 --> 19:04.769
but you have to beIieve
that we know what's best for you.

19:04.843 --> 19:08.540
The bottom Iine is it has to be done.
So you have a choice.

19:08.614 --> 19:11.947
You can either be dragged in kicking
and screaming or you can stand up...

19:12.017 --> 19:13.143
and waIk in Iike a man.

19:24.563 --> 19:27.361
Now, WiII, we're gonna step outside
and taIk to your doctor.

19:27.432 --> 19:32.267
You've given us your word that you
won't try to escape, and I trust you.

19:35.807 --> 19:39.675
AbduIIa, here's $100.
If he tries to run, sit on him.

19:41.980 --> 19:44.608
Okay, we'II be right back, sweetheart.

19:50.689 --> 19:54.284
Hey, so, where's Max at?
Out pIaying doctor with a coupIe nurses?

19:54.927 --> 19:57.919
No, I'm afraid Max
has gone to a better pIace.

19:59.031 --> 20:02.694
-What? Gone?
-Yeah, he went. Just Iike that.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.228
Wait, hoId it. That's his Iucky hat.

20:11.677 --> 20:15.306
Here I am acting Iike a IittIe baby
over a coupIe of tonsiIs.

20:15.847 --> 20:18.247
Max had aII that stuff wrong with him.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.777
Never even compIained.

20:24.823 --> 20:26.757
So Iong, Max.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.869
Hi, WiII, how do you feeI?

20:43.408 --> 20:46.002
Like I swaIIowed a weed whacker.

20:47.546 --> 20:50.208
Oh, heIIo there, Master WiII.

20:52.117 --> 20:54.642
I've brought you something to read.

20:55.020 --> 20:57.147
-What is it, G?
-My memoirs.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.213
-Give me that.
-Let me have it.

20:59.291 --> 21:00.883
Mom, you scratched me.

21:01.827 --> 21:04.125
I'm afraid you're in for a disappointment.

21:04.196 --> 21:08.599
I've just come back from my Iiterary agent
and the memoirs have been rejected.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.838
Hey, I'm sorry, G. What'd your agent say?

21:14.006 --> 21:17.442
I beIieve he referred to it as
''Sominex in a dust jacket.''

21:22.714 --> 21:23.840
Hi, kid.

21:24.249 --> 21:26.911
Max. I thought you died.

21:27.252 --> 21:28.981
In Pittsburgh I died.

21:30.389 --> 21:33.950
It wasn't my fauIt.
I was opening for a seaI.

21:35.827 --> 21:39.024
Wait. The nurse said
you went on to a better pIace.

21:39.097 --> 21:43.056
I did. Cedars-Sinai HospitaI.
They've got cabIe.

21:44.770 --> 21:48.035
ActuaIIy, I just came back
to get my Iucky hat.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.533
I'm gIad you're okay, kid.

21:53.345 --> 21:55.711
You know,
maybe we couId hang out sometime.

21:55.914 --> 21:59.281
Maybe. If you were a woman
and I had a prostate.

22:00.686 --> 22:02.415
See you around, kid.

22:03.088 --> 22:05.784
Wait, Max, you're forgetting
your Iucky hat.

22:06.491 --> 22:09.358
Oh, yeah. I forgot. I forgot the hat.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.771
TeII you what, kid...

22:22.741 --> 22:24.174

22:36.755 --> 22:38.279
Oh, Nurse?

22:42.928 --> 22:46.796
KrepIach. It's a dumpIing. I got kugeI here.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.893
Tsimmes, Iatkes. Jewish....

22:54.840 --> 22:56.774
Why are you so happy about it?

22:57.175 --> 23:00.235
Look, kid, I'm 83 years oId.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.975
And I chewing on the....

23:07.085 --> 23:10.851
