WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.805
Oh... you're gonna regret that.

00:04.838 --> 00:05.973
Pigfoot was your favorite.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.308
He wasn't real, Burt.

00:07.341 --> 00:08.642
None of this stuff is real.

00:08.676 --> 00:10.744
Hey. We came
as fast as we could.

00:10.778 --> 00:13.714
Wait a minute, you're not
bleeding from your ear.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.649
Damn it. I was really excited
to either save your life

00:15.683 --> 00:17.085
or end it compassionately.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.420
I just said that
to get you over here.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.655
It's your mother--
I've never seen her like this.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.058
(Sabrina gasps)
Mom, what are you doing?

00:24.092 --> 00:25.426
Oh, come on, Virginia, that's
your authentic

00:25.459 --> 00:27.027
Navajo dreamcatcher

00:27.061 --> 00:29.029
that we got at the Trail
of Tears Casino and Suites.

00:29.063 --> 00:31.565
I'm done with all this
make-believe stuff, Burt.

00:31.599 --> 00:32.933
How's a bunch of string
and feathers

00:32.966 --> 00:35.002
supposed to hold
thousands of dreams?

00:35.035 --> 00:37.505
And... who needs this telescope?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.307
There's no such thing as UFOs.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.675
Telescopes don't
just look at UFOs.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.677
They actually have a variety
of scientific uses...

00:43.711 --> 00:44.845
Oh, grow up.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.047
(crashing)

00:47.081 --> 00:48.182
What happened to you?

00:48.216 --> 00:49.383
BURT:
I'll tell you what happened.

00:49.417 --> 00:50.951
That mermaid special on TV.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.687
I just saw a special
where actual scientists--

00:53.721 --> 00:55.623
Norwegian scientists--

00:55.656 --> 00:57.758
proved the existence
of mermaids.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.193
Do you know how
many mermaids

00:59.227 --> 01:01.095
get caught in fishing nets
every year?

01:01.129 --> 01:02.896
None...

01:02.930 --> 01:05.966
because mermaids, like actual
cans of dolphin-safe tuna...

01:05.999 --> 01:07.768
don't really exist.

01:07.801 --> 01:10.104
You're a mermaid
holocaust denier.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.643
Attention Howdy's shoppers.

01:15.676 --> 01:20.381
This store is selling mermaid
contaminated tuna fish.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.583
(screams)

01:23.784 --> 01:26.086
That show was a total
hoax, Virginia.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.889
But it was on that channel

01:28.922 --> 01:30.258
where you're supposed to
learn stuff.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.926
Plus, the narrator was British.

01:32.960 --> 01:35.496
Look at this. Ah!

01:35.529 --> 01:38.466
Jude Law and the network
apologized...

01:38.499 --> 01:40.301
saying, "We never
would've aired the film

01:40.334 --> 01:42.570
if we thought there were people
stupid enough to fall for it."

01:42.603 --> 01:44.272
Mm-mm.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.839
I've been burned too many times.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.941
I'm done believing
in anything magical:

01:47.975 --> 01:51.679
dreamcatchers, ghosts,
angels, Criss Angel.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.282
And definitely not Pigfoots.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.418
BURT:
Oh...

01:57.451 --> 01:59.253
Don't go throwin' ghosts
into all the nutty crap

01:59.287 --> 02:00.488
you used to believe in.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.655
Ghosts are real.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.292
I've got one
living in my closet.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.093
You people can believe
whatever you want.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.295
I'm done.

02:08.529 --> 02:10.931
Apparently she's also
stopped believing

02:10.964 --> 02:12.433
in cleaning up her own messes.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.767
*

02:13.801 --> 02:15.703
* Whoo!

02:15.736 --> 02:20.308
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

02:24.044 --> 02:25.479
(sighs)

02:25.513 --> 02:26.680
What are you doing?

02:26.714 --> 02:28.816
Huh? Nothing.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.218
You're not trying to put
that stupid pigurine

02:30.251 --> 02:31.519
back together, are you?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.721
Well, I was hoping when
you cooled off,

02:33.754 --> 02:35.356
you might want it again.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.291
I tried to buy you one,
but it turns out they're not

02:37.325 --> 02:38.792
selling them anymore
'cause apparently

02:38.826 --> 02:40.794
they're made out of
(coughing) asbestos.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.996
I tried to fix it,
but it's impossible.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.666
Now I see why God never actually
made a pig Sasquatch--

02:45.699 --> 02:47.968
it's-it's very time-consuming.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.703
Don't bother trying to fix it.

02:49.737 --> 02:52.373
Pigurines are a ceramic lie.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.508
Pigs can't have careers.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.310
The truth is, they're just
bacon and footballs.

02:56.344 --> 02:57.878
End of story.

02:57.911 --> 03:00.180
I miss the woman who believed
pigs could be policeman

03:00.214 --> 03:02.316
or lawyers or pork-tologists.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.885
Well, she's gone.
(sighs)

03:04.918 --> 03:07.855
I used to think there was more
to life than being a maid...

03:07.888 --> 03:09.490
I was wrong.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.392
You scrub toilets
and then you die.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.527
Oh, come on, Virginia,
you're not just a maid anymore.

03:13.561 --> 03:15.529
(sighs)
You're a crew chief now.

03:15.563 --> 03:18.366
It's not just scrubbing toilets,
you do paperwork, too.

03:20.268 --> 03:23.036
My closet ghost
is getting feisty.

03:23.070 --> 03:24.405
He threw a lamp.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.873
(gasping): I can't,
I can't sleep in there.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.408
Maw Maw, there's no
such thing as ghosts.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.176
You probably just
knocked it over yourself.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.878
Did not.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.179
Dibs on the middle.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.614
Let's make a Maw Maw sandwich.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.716
No, Maw Maw. Just go
on back to your room.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.451
Will you take me?
I'm scared.

03:37.485 --> 03:39.687
Fine!
(groans)

03:39.720 --> 03:41.989
Sucker.
What? (sighs)

03:44.091 --> 03:45.593
If I start to scream...

03:45.626 --> 03:49.697
just slap me and tell
me the war's over.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.599
This is ridiculous.

03:51.632 --> 03:54.568
I'm going to prove to you that
there's no such thing as ghosts.

03:54.602 --> 03:55.869
(snoring)

03:55.903 --> 03:58.306
Okay, so...

03:58.339 --> 04:00.908
the windows in there
are boarded up.

04:00.941 --> 04:04.211
This door is locked.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.880
And I'm putting powder down.

04:06.914 --> 04:10.083
So if anyone tries to go
in or out...

04:10.117 --> 04:11.652
there'll be footprints.

04:11.685 --> 04:15.456
So I challenge your ghost
to prove that it's here.

04:16.924 --> 04:19.427
But my guess is, that in the
morning when we wake up,

04:19.460 --> 04:22.129
everything's gonna be
exactly how I left it.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.900
(door closes)

04:26.934 --> 04:29.036
(birds chirping)

04:31.805 --> 04:33.073
There you go. See?

04:33.106 --> 04:35.108
Nothing's changed.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.610
Now you'll know how I felt

04:36.644 --> 04:39.079
when I was
dumb enough to believe.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.514
Who are you?

04:40.548 --> 04:43.317
Is this cocaine
on the floor up for grabs?

04:43.351 --> 04:46.620
Prepare to feel like
an idiot, Maw Maw.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.390
*

04:56.497 --> 04:57.931
Oh, my God.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.199
We have a ghost.

04:59.232 --> 05:00.534
(rattling)

05:00.568 --> 05:02.970
It's making Maw Maw's
nightstand vibrate.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.640
(switch clicks, rattling stops)

05:15.983 --> 05:18.852
I'm sorry I ever doubted
you, dreamcatcher.

05:18.886 --> 05:21.321
I hope you catch dreams
as well as you caught fire.

05:21.355 --> 05:22.690
Speaking of fire...

05:22.723 --> 05:24.191
let's burn this house
before we're slaughtered

05:24.224 --> 05:25.726
in the night
by this angry poltergeist.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.628
Burt, it's obviously
a nice ghost.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.329
He made a smiley face.

05:29.363 --> 05:31.732
I've seen all five
Paranormal Activity movies.

05:31.765 --> 05:34.001
I promise you,
this does not end well for us.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.803
Did you say you wanted me
to believe again?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.471
Well now... I believe.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.872
Well, there's a big difference

05:38.906 --> 05:40.574
between mermaids and
angry vengeful phantoms.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.911
I feel like I could
take a mermaid... on land.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.380
In a bathtub,
it'd be anybody's game.

05:49.883 --> 05:51.419
Maw Maw,

05:51.452 --> 05:53.020
were you in the laundry room?

05:53.053 --> 05:54.388
I don't go in there;

05:54.422 --> 05:56.256
that TV only gets
the clothes channel.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.759
Burt, did you do
the laundry?

05:58.792 --> 06:01.562
Not since the great
acid-wash disaster of '91.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.531
We got jeans...
(grunts)

06:03.564 --> 06:04.832
and we got acid.

06:04.865 --> 06:07.167
How hard can it be?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.936
(rattling)

06:08.969 --> 06:10.438
(loud bang)

06:10.471 --> 06:12.039
(rattling)

06:17.377 --> 06:18.546
Well, he's thorough.

06:18.579 --> 06:21.348
He even cleaned out
the pube catcher.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.750
You're winning me over, ghost!

06:22.783 --> 06:24.918
Whoever you are!

06:24.952 --> 06:26.554
We brought a bag of ice!

06:26.587 --> 06:28.021
Where's the thumb?!
Where's Burt's thumb?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.823
Good job getting here so fast.
