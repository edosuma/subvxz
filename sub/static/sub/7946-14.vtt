00:28.083 --> 00:29.980
Now, how do I make sure

00:29.981 --> 00:31.876
I go with someone

00:28.083 --> 00:31.876
as awesome as I am?

00:31.918 --> 00:33.310

- I'll help you.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.647
One cootie-free cutie

00:34.648 --> 00:35.959

00:36.000 --> 00:37.460

00:37.461 --> 00:38.918
I'm available too.

00:38.959 --> 00:40.418
Uh, no offense, Jessie,

00:40.419 --> 00:41.876
but I'm gonna go with

00:41.918 --> 00:42.939
Emma's track record

00:42.940 --> 00:43.959
on this one.

00:45.209 --> 00:46.459
That's fair.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.976
- Jessie, I'm the spirit
- coordinator for the dance,

00:50.000 --> 00:51.459
So I could use some help.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.210
I have tons to do,

00:53.211 --> 00:54.918
including finding

00:51.500 --> 00:54.918
a giant Viking statue.

00:54.959 --> 00:56.167
And you need that because...

00:56.209 --> 00:57.626
Because the whole point

00:57.627 --> 00:59.042
of the Win Big Shindig

00:59.083 --> 01:00.292
is to throw stuff

01:00.293 --> 01:01.500
at the rival school's

00:59.083 --> 01:01.500
mascot! Duh!

my Armadillo Scout

let me tell you my news.

03:24.292 --> 03:26.022
I got a part as

03:26.023 --> 03:27.751
a supernumerary at

the Metropolitan Opera!

03:27.792 --> 03:29.418
Bertram, that's fantastic!

03:29.419 --> 03:31.042
Do you have a line?

03:31.083 --> 03:32.751
No, but I get to

03:32.752 --> 03:34.417

and wear a cool hat!

(VOCALIZING)

Aw.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.355

03:44.356 --> 03:45.626
this was a very dangerous

03:43.083 --> 03:45.626

03:49.834 --> 03:50.939
And so, if your total

03:50.940 --> 03:52.042
number of protons

03:52.083 --> 03:53.605
is not equal to your

03:53.606 --> 03:55.125
total number of electrons,

03:55.167 --> 03:57.209
Ravi, do you have an ion?

03:57.250 --> 03:58.501
I certainly have

03:58.502 --> 03:59.751
an "eye on" someone.

04:01.083 --> 04:02.459
Ravi, where's my

04:02.460 --> 04:03.834
main science guy?

Ravi Ross,

Okay, Nora's on her way.

04:30.083 --> 04:31.083
When she gets here,

04:31.084 --> 04:32.083
I'm gonna ask her

04:30.083 --> 04:32.083
to the dance

04:32.125 --> 04:33.500
and blow her mind.

04:33.542 --> 04:34.793

04:34.794 --> 04:36.042

- she will say yes?

04:37.209 --> 04:38.251

04:38.252 --> 04:39.292
I've got this face,

04:39.334 --> 04:40.667

04:40.668 --> 04:42.000
and two coats of deodorant.

04:50.814 --> 04:52.375
trouble inviting Jax.

04:52.417 --> 04:55.042
Wait, you want to ask Jax?

04:55.083 --> 04:56.083
She'll eat you up

04:56.084 --> 04:57.084
and spit you out!

04:57.125 --> 04:59.084
And then brag to her friends

04:59.085 --> 05:01.042
about how far she spit you!

05:01.083 --> 05:03.063
I admit, she may be

05:03.064 --> 05:05.042
a little "rough

05:01.083 --> 05:05.042
around the edges"

05:05.083 --> 05:07.063
and "bloodthirsty,"

05:07.064 --> 05:09.042
but I kind of dig it.

05:10.167 --> 05:11.667
Ravi, Jax only likes

05:11.668 --> 05:13.167
bad boys.

05:13.209 --> 05:15.376
And, you know,

05:15.377 --> 05:17.542
look at you.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.563
Although truth be told,

05:25.564 --> 05:27.042
it has been

05:24.083 --> 05:27.042
driving me crazy.

05:28.125 --> 05:29.125

- Did they cancel Whisk Wars?

06:42.459 --> 06:43.563
No, I'm nervous because

06:43.564 --> 06:44.667
the opera director

06:44.709 --> 06:46.375
gave me a one-line solo.

06:46.417 --> 06:47.501
There's a big difference

06:47.502 --> 06:48.584
between singing at the Met

06:48.626 --> 06:49.855
and singing to a shampoo

06:49.856 --> 06:51.083
bottle in the shower.

06:51.125 --> 06:52.418
Okay, first of all,

06:51.125 --> 06:53.709
start the kids' lunches.

06:53.751 --> 06:55.591
- And second of all,
- why do you have shampoo?

At least

06:58.773 --> 06:59.959

07:07.273 --> 07:08.334
different gossip chains

07:08.375 --> 07:09.480
to make sure it got back

07:09.481 --> 07:10.584
to each of my three options

07:10.626 --> 07:12.334
- that I want him
- to invite me.

07:12.375 --> 07:14.536
- But putting your dish
- in the sink is too much work.

07:16.834 --> 07:18.751
- Oh, wow, when you said
- planning the dance

07:18.792 --> 07:20.584
Was a lot of heavy lifting,

07:20.585 --> 07:22.375
you weren't kidding.

07:22.417 --> 07:24.085
I'm so stressed.

07:24.086 --> 07:25.751
We don't even have

07:22.417 --> 07:25.751
a band for the dance yet.

07:25.792 --> 07:27.210
How am I supposed

07:25.792 --> 07:28.626

- I can help!
- Uh, what can I do?

- Pick up the cake?
- Make the punch?

papier mache Viking statue

07:35.417 --> 07:39.250

- So, someone's already
- making the punch?

(GRUNTS) Geez, how does

07:45.585 --> 07:47.250
the football team fit

07:43.918 --> 07:47.250
Ravi in here every day?

07:49.000 --> 07:50.167
Emma, it worked!

07:50.209 --> 07:51.480
All three boys

07:51.481 --> 07:52.751
invited me to the dance!

07:52.792 --> 07:54.667
- So now should I go
- talk to Martin

07:54.709 --> 07:56.001
And tell him

07:56.002 --> 07:57.292
he's the lucky guy?

07:57.334 --> 07:58.709
Sure, if you want to scare

07:58.710 --> 08:00.083
him away forever! (SIGHS)

08:00.125 --> 08:01.168
If you answer too quickly,

08:01.169 --> 08:02.209
you'll look desperate.

08:02.250 --> 08:04.459
(SIGHS) This is exhausting.

08:04.500 --> 08:05.751
By the time this

08:05.752 --> 08:07.000
shindig rolls around,

08:07.042 --> 08:08.167
I'll be so tired that when

08:08.168 --> 08:09.292
I wave my hands in the air

08:09.334 --> 08:10.584
like I just don't care,

08:10.585 --> 08:11.834
I really won't care.

08:16.918 --> 08:18.000
I don't wanna know.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.001
Jax, I hope that is not

08:23.002 --> 08:25.042
permanent marker.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.855
I mean, way to deface

08:32.375 --> 08:33.480
You have left your

08:33.481 --> 08:34.583
textbooks in your locker.

08:34.626 --> 08:36.250
Hmm. It's not my locker.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.667
Hey, Ravi, this might be

08:40.668 --> 08:42.375
a little weird

08:38.958 --> 08:42.375
for me to ask,

08:42.417 --> 08:43.768
- since we barely
- know each other...

08:43.792 --> 08:45.250
Is this actually happening?

08:45.292 --> 08:46.792
The answer is yes,

08:46.793 --> 08:48.292
yes to the tenth power, yes!

08:48.334 --> 08:49.834
Sweet! Here's my

08:49.835 --> 08:51.334
chemistry homework.

08:48.334 --> 08:51.334
I owe you.

08:57.731 --> 08:59.375
you have to order a Viking

Bertram, you going

09:08.460 --> 09:09.876
through puberty?

09:09.918 --> 09:10.980
It's always been my dream

09:10.981 --> 09:12.042
to perform at the Met.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.251
(STAMMERING) But I'm afraid

09:13.252 --> 09:14.417
I'll embarrass myself.

09:14.459 --> 09:15.606
But you're in a boy band.

09:15.607 --> 09:16.751
Aren't you used

09:14.459 --> 09:16.751
to performing?

09:16.792 --> 09:19.375
And embarrassing yourself?

In Badd Direction,

09:23.794 --> 09:25.042
they only wanted me

09:22.542 --> 09:25.042
for my body.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.918
Oh. Oh, Bertram.

09:26.959 --> 09:28.167
No, no, I'm positive

09:28.168 --> 09:29.375
they wanted you

09:26.959 --> 09:29.375
for your voice. Positive.

09:32.334 --> 09:33.605
So, is there any world

09:33.606 --> 09:34.876
at all in which

09:34.918 --> 09:36.393
- "Here is my chemistry

09:36.417 --> 09:38.042
"Future valedictorians

09:38.043 --> 09:39.667
are my jam?"

09:39.709 --> 09:41.876
Ravi, Jax has gotten

09:41.877 --> 09:44.042
three suspensions,

09:39.709 --> 09:44.042
and 27 tardies.

09:46.417 --> 09:47.730
Okay, if you wanna

09:47.731 --> 09:49.042
win her over,

09:46.417 --> 09:49.042
you've gotta be badder.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.584
I believe you mean "worse."

09:51.626 --> 09:54.417
Ah, yes, now I hear it.

09:54.459 --> 09:55.938
Okay, Ravi, it's not enough

09:55.939 --> 09:57.417
to just dress like a rebel.

09:57.459 --> 09:58.606
You might actually have

09:58.607 --> 09:59.751
to break a rule.

09:59.792 --> 10:02.042
(GASPS) Break a rule?

10:02.083 --> 10:03.272
Do you think she would

10:03.273 --> 10:04.459
like to watch me take

10:02.083 --> 10:04.459
a standardized test

10:04.500 --> 10:07.042
with a No. 1 pencil?

10:07.083 --> 10:09.063
Okay. Can you go be

10:09.064 --> 10:11.042
lame somewhere else?

10:11.083 --> 10:12.542
Once Nora gets here,

10:12.543 --> 10:14.000
a skywriter is

10:11.083 --> 10:14.000
going to fly by

10:14.042 --> 10:15.042
and write a message

10:15.043 --> 10:16.043
asking her to the dance.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.542
It's a lot of moving parts,

10:17.543 --> 10:19.000
but what could go wrong?

10:20.584 --> 10:22.542

10:26.293 --> 10:27.500
blow up all right.

10:27.542 --> 10:29.042
Thanks to you,

10:29.043 --> 10:30.542
I waited too long

10:27.542 --> 10:30.542
to get back to them,

10:30.584 --> 10:31.626
so they all got

10:31.627 --> 10:32.667
other dates to the dance!

10:32.709 --> 10:34.500
Ooh, that's a clever move.

10:34.542 --> 10:36.000

- who's coaching them?

10:37.584 --> 10:39.126
No one!

10:39.127 --> 10:40.667
This whole thing is stupid!

10:40.709 --> 10:42.375

- to play games,

just told Martin

I wanted to go with him.

Who is "Laura"?

11:53.083 --> 11:55.397
H2O is water, and H2O2

11:55.398 --> 11:57.709
is hydrogen peroxide.

11:57.751 --> 12:01.125
So, class, what is H2O4?

12:02.918 --> 12:04.584
Drinking.

12:04.626 --> 12:06.042
(MR. FEELY CHUCKLES)

12:06.083 --> 12:07.438
Get it?

12:07.439 --> 12:08.792
H2O is "for" drinking?

12:10.626 --> 12:12.542
- Really, Ravi?
- Not even a chuckle?

12:12.584 --> 12:13.626
You're the one

12:13.627 --> 12:14.667
who forwarded me

12:12.584 --> 12:14.667
those chemistry jokes.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.709
Uh...

12:16.751 --> 12:18.126
I am sure I do not know

12:18.127 --> 12:19.500
what you are talking about.

Anyway, hydrogen peroxide

12:26.461 --> 12:28.209
has many applications.

12:28.250 --> 12:29.397
It also has

12:29.398 --> 12:30.542
a very explosive reaction

12:30.584 --> 12:31.668
when mixed with

12:31.669 --> 12:32.751
potassium iodide.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.272
Ooh! Explosive enough

12:34.273 --> 12:35.751
to crack a safe?

12:35.792 --> 12:37.418
Finally, we're learning

12:37.419 --> 12:39.042
something useful!

12:40.564 --> 12:42.042
to cause explosions in this

Just ask my predecessor,

12:43.084 --> 12:44.084
Mr. Lefty.

12:45.918 --> 12:47.459
So causing an explosion

12:47.460 --> 12:49.000
in class would be

12:50.083 --> 12:51.417
breaking a rule?

12:51.459 --> 12:52.626

how funny you think

Well, if you're so

13:23.877 --> 13:25.125
worried about Ravi,

13:22.626 --> 13:25.125
you can join him.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.417
What?

13:26.418 --> 13:27.667
No, you're just mad that

13:27.709 --> 13:29.626
- he can actually
- make us laugh.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.626
H2O is for drinking!

13:31.667 --> 13:32.855
Think about it, people,

13:32.856 --> 13:34.042

Oh.

- didn't fly?

depressed for wordplay.

Luke, sometimes

13:48.815 --> 13:50.709
when you just relax

13:46.918 --> 13:50.709
and let things happen,

- they take care
- of themselves.

Okay?

13:53.751 --> 13:54.959
What?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.522
No! No, I said a giant

13:56.523 --> 13:58.042
statue of a Norseman,

13:58.083 --> 14:00.042
not a horse man!

14:00.083 --> 14:01.397
Here. Can you take

14:01.398 --> 14:02.709
these to the gym for me?

Viking emergency.

14:10.042 --> 14:11.626
- Luke?
- Nora!

14:12.792 --> 14:14.709
I can't believe this.

14:14.751 --> 14:16.167
You did all this for me?

14:17.083 --> 14:18.167
Uh...

14:19.918 --> 14:20.918
Yes, I did.

14:22.292 --> 14:24.168
This is so sweet!

14:24.169 --> 14:26.042
I thought you hated me.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.542
Wait, the marching band

14:27.543 --> 14:29.000
isn't hiding anywhere, is it?

14:30.709 --> 14:31.834
Nora, I'm really sorry

14:31.835 --> 14:32.959
about all that.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.042
It's just, you know,

14:35.083 --> 14:36.501
you're the coolest girl

14:36.502 --> 14:37.918
in school,

14:37.959 --> 14:39.626
and I didn't think you'd

14:39.627 --> 14:41.292
go to the dance with me

14:37.959 --> 14:41.292
unless I asked in a big way.

14:41.334 --> 14:43.043
Well, I'd say

14:43.044 --> 14:44.751
this is pretty big.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.397
Although I heard some

14:46.398 --> 14:48.000
girl named Laura got

14:44.792 --> 14:48.000
asked by a skywriter.

14:50.876 --> 14:53.876
So, uh...

14:53.918 --> 14:55.375
- Will you go
- to the dance with me?

14:56.167 --> 14:57.834
I'd love to.

14:57.876 --> 14:59.355
And you know, you didn't

14:59.356 --> 15:00.834
have to go through

14:57.876 --> 15:00.834
all this trouble.

15:00.876 --> 15:02.438
(LAUGHS) Trust me,

15:02.439 --> 15:04.000
when prom rolls around,

15:00.876 --> 15:04.000
I'm just sending a text.

15:07.042 --> 15:09.250
So, this is detention.

15:09.292 --> 15:11.876
The Slammer. The Big House.

15:11.918 --> 15:12.980
What should I do first?

15:12.981 --> 15:14.042
Pump some iron?

15:14.083 --> 15:16.751
Make a friend named Bubba?

15:16.792 --> 15:17.792
How about

15:17.793 --> 15:18.793
quietly do your homework?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.397
Mr. Feeley, I assume

15:20.398 --> 15:21.959
this was supposed

15:18.834 --> 15:21.959
to be a punishment.

15:23.083 --> 15:24.876
- You know, I hope
- you're both happy.

15:24.918 --> 15:26.084
I had to cancel

15:26.085 --> 15:27.250
a hot date tonight for this.

15:27.292 --> 15:28.834
That's not true.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.375
No, it isn't.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.417
You two stay put.

15:33.459 --> 15:35.059
- I'm going to the bathroom
- to try wash these

15:35.083 --> 15:36.250
Chemicals off again.

15:37.375 --> 15:38.647
Everyone keeps asking

15:38.648 --> 15:39.918
if I'm an Avatar.

15:43.792 --> 15:45.084
You know, I had

15:45.085 --> 15:46.375
big plans for the dance.

15:46.417 --> 15:48.042
- I have a whole locker
- of tomatoes

15:48.083 --> 15:49.792
- I was going to throw
- at that Viking!

15:49.834 --> 15:51.585
And maybe one or two

15:51.586 --> 15:53.334
at the principal

15:49.834 --> 15:53.334
"by accident."

15:53.375 --> 15:54.855
Jax, I am truly sorry

15:54.856 --> 15:56.334
for getting you into this.

15:57.834 --> 15:58.939
Hey, why did you cause

15:58.940 --> 16:00.042
that explosion anyway?

16:00.083 --> 16:01.792
You never do anything wrong.

16:01.834 --> 16:02.918
Well, I thought

16:02.919 --> 16:04.000
you only liked bad boys,

16:05.209 --> 16:07.083
- and I wanted to
- ask you to the dance.

16:07.125 --> 16:08.813
What? Why would you want

16:08.814 --> 16:10.500
to go with someone like me?

16:10.542 --> 16:11.689
When I ask someone

16:11.690 --> 16:12.834
if they wanna dance,

16:12.876 --> 16:14.022
it usually means

16:14.023 --> 16:15.167
I'm starting a fist fight.

16:15.209 --> 16:16.605
I know, and that really

16:16.606 --> 16:18.000
gets my beaker boiling.

16:19.584 --> 16:20.792
I love that you do not care

16:20.793 --> 16:22.000
what anyone thinks.

16:22.042 --> 16:23.500
Neither do you.

16:23.542 --> 16:25.021
Like, aren't you

16:25.022 --> 16:26.500
the kid who's in that

16:23.542 --> 16:26.500
weird lizard group?

16:26.542 --> 16:28.189
Reptile Club,

16:28.190 --> 16:29.834
but let us not

16:26.542 --> 16:29.834
split scales.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.064
Maybe we have more

16:33.065 --> 16:34.167
in common than I

16:31.959 --> 16:34.167
previously thought.

16:34.959 --> 16:37.042
Maybe.

16:37.083 --> 16:38.563
Hey, we should get

16:38.564 --> 16:40.042
matching tattoos!

16:40.083 --> 16:41.688
(LAUGHS) Although it is

16:41.689 --> 16:43.292
important to celebrate

16:40.083 --> 16:43.292
our differences.

16:45.083 --> 16:47.063
Hey, why don't we

16:47.064 --> 16:49.042
bust out of this joint

16:45.083 --> 16:49.042
and go to the dance?

16:49.083 --> 16:51.792
Really? Like, together?

16:52.209 --> 16:54.042
- Sure.
- Oh.

16:54.083 --> 16:55.292
But what if Mr. Feeley

16:55.293 --> 16:56.500
sees us in the hall?

16:56.542 --> 16:58.375
- Oh. We're not
- going through the hall.

16:59.918 --> 17:00.918
We're going

17:00.919 --> 17:01.919
through the wall.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.000

(RAVI SCREAMS)

17:24.166 --> 17:26.041
Ouch!

17:26.083 --> 17:27.146
Still, that was easier

17:27.147 --> 17:28.209
than climbing up it.

17:30.375 --> 17:32.042
Hello, Viceroy High?

17:32.083 --> 17:33.522
Yeah, I was wondering

17:33.523 --> 17:34.959
how open you are

17:32.083 --> 17:34.959
to changing your mascot

17:35.000 --> 17:36.584
from a viking to a centaur?

17:36.626 --> 17:37.938
I mean, a nice torso

17:37.939 --> 17:39.250
is a nice torso, am I right?

17:40.083 --> 17:41.083
Hello?

17:43.626 --> 17:45.584
- Why are you sitting
- here by yourself?

17:45.626 --> 17:46.834
I can't slow dance alone,

17:46.835 --> 17:48.042
can I?

17:48.083 --> 17:49.251
It's times like these

17:49.252 --> 17:50.417
I wish I hadn't killed off

17:50.459 --> 17:52.042
all my imaginary friends.

17:55.042 --> 17:56.521
Zuri, I'm sorry

17:56.522 --> 17:58.000
I gave you bad advice.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.292
Are you still mad?

18:00.334 --> 18:01.667
No. I know you were

18:01.668 --> 18:03.000
only trying to help.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.250
Still, I feel terrible.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.626
So I told Martin

18:06.627 --> 18:07.959
it was all my fault,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.685
- and he really wants to
- have a dance with you.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.000
(GASPS) He does?

18:13.334 --> 18:14.959
Thanks, Emma.

18:14.960 --> 18:16.584
And I know I said

18:13.334 --> 18:16.584
I wasn't mad,

18:16.626 --> 18:17.855
but check your sheets

18:17.856 --> 18:19.083
before you get

18:16.626 --> 18:19.083
in bed tonight.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.959
A-ha! There you are!

18:24.000 --> 18:25.522
Ravi, you got detention?

18:25.523 --> 18:27.042
And disappeared?

18:27.083 --> 18:28.683
- And turned your
- teacher into a Smurf!

18:30.542 --> 18:31.959
Please let us stay.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.500
You know dancing

18:33.501 --> 18:35.000
with a girl was

18:32.000 --> 18:35.000
on my bucket list.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.667
- What do you say,
- Mr. Feeley?

18:37.709 --> 18:39.147
We know Ravi made some

18:39.148 --> 18:40.584
bad decisions today,

18:40.626 --> 18:41.834
but we both know

18:41.835 --> 18:43.042
he's a good kid.

18:43.083 --> 18:45.000
- Well, if there's
- one thing I've learned,

18:45.042 --> 18:46.251
It's that you can't

18:46.252 --> 18:47.459
fight chemistry.

18:47.500 --> 18:48.897
I was quite the ladies' man

18:48.898 --> 18:50.292
in high school, you know.

18:50.334 --> 18:52.042
(SCOFFS) That's not true.

18:52.083 --> 18:54.250
No, it isn't.

18:54.292 --> 18:55.688
Ravi, out of respect

18:55.689 --> 18:57.083
for our friendship,

18:54.292 --> 18:57.083
I'll let you stay.

18:58.584 --> 19:00.417
- But Jax has to fix
- my heating grate,

19:00.459 --> 19:01.730
And you have to fix

19:01.731 --> 19:03.000
my master's thesis.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.000
BOTH: Deal!

19:05.042 --> 19:06.355
All right.

19:06.356 --> 19:07.667
Have fun, you two.

19:07.709 --> 19:09.459
- And if you hurt him,
- I know Krav Maga.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.563
Yikes. Maybe I shouldn't

19:13.564 --> 19:15.042
have stolen her wallet.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.042
(CHUCKLES)

19:16.083 --> 19:18.167
Aw, isn't this sweet?

19:18.209 --> 19:20.126
Yup! And now it's time

19:20.127 --> 19:22.042
to destroy the Viking!

19:22.083 --> 19:24.042
Uh... Yeah, about that...

19:24.083 --> 19:26.042
- Thanks again, Jessie,
- for helping me.

19:26.083 --> 19:27.792
Without a rival

19:27.793 --> 19:29.500
mascot to ridicule,

19:26.083 --> 19:29.500
I'd be ostrich-sized!

19:29.542 --> 19:31.626
Oh, Emma, that

19:31.627 --> 19:33.709
word of the day app

19:29.542 --> 19:33.709
is almost working.

19:33.751 --> 19:34.897
Yeah, I'm a walking

19:34.898 --> 19:36.042
tyrannosaurus!

19:36.083 --> 19:37.083
Uh...

19:39.083 --> 19:40.918
Jessie! I was on my way

19:40.919 --> 19:42.751
to the Met, and I panicked.

19:42.792 --> 19:44.418
What if everyone boos

19:44.419 --> 19:46.042
and throws things at me?

19:46.083 --> 19:47.313
Wait a minute.

19:47.314 --> 19:48.542
You're a Viking?

19:48.584 --> 19:49.814
No, I just like the feel

19:49.815 --> 19:51.042
of a fur-lined romper.

19:51.083 --> 19:52.292
Of course I'm a Viking!

19:54.083 --> 19:55.417
Okay, listen.

19:55.459 --> 19:57.226
- What if I told you
- there is a way you could

19:57.250 --> 19:59.042
- Face your fear
- before the show,

19:59.083 --> 20:00.147
In front

20:00.148 --> 20:01.209
of the toughest audience

19:59.083 --> 20:01.209
