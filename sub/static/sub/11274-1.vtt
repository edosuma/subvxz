CARLA: Hey, Cheers is filmed
before a live studio audience.

00:22.405 --> 00:24.407
Hi, it's me.

00:24.407 --> 00:25.909
Li-listen, I've, uh...

00:25.909 --> 00:27.827
I've been thinking about you and...

00:29.129 --> 00:31.164
Oh, what the hell.

00:31.164 --> 00:33.550
Will you marry me?

00:36.920 --> 00:37.921
Sam?

00:37.921 --> 00:38.922
SAM: Well,

00:38.922 --> 00:40.473
who else do you think it'd be?

00:40.473 --> 00:42.842
Sam, if this is some kind of a joke...

00:42.842 --> 00:44.344
SAM: No, I'm serious.

00:44.344 --> 00:46.346
Will you marry me?

00:50.483 --> 00:51.985
Oh!

00:51.985 --> 00:53.987
Oh, my God.

00:53.987 --> 00:57.490
I'm... I'm stunned.

00:57.490 --> 00:58.992
I mean, it's-it's not like

00:58.992 --> 01:01.494
I never expected to hear this from you.

01:01.494 --> 01:02.495
It's just that

01:02.495 --> 01:05.114
one is...

01:05.114 --> 01:07.667
...is never quite
prepared for the question.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.953
Oh, Sam, I'm touched. I...

01:09.953 --> 01:11.254
(Diane laughs)

01:11.254 --> 01:13.623
All... All at once, I...

01:13.623 --> 01:15.625
I'm-I'm feeling giddiness,

01:15.625 --> 01:17.627
fear, euphoria, relief.

01:17.627 --> 01:20.013
I-I don't know what to say.

01:20.013 --> 01:21.381
Oh, that's okay.

01:21.381 --> 01:22.632
I'm not listening anymore.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.271
Sam,
I-I-I...

01:28.271 --> 01:30.774
I can't answer you now.

01:30.774 --> 01:33.276
Not like this.

01:33.276 --> 01:35.278
Every woman

01:35.278 --> 01:38.281
wants her proposal to be...

01:38.281 --> 01:40.150
enchanting,

01:40.150 --> 01:42.986
something she can remember
for the rest of her life.

01:42.986 --> 01:44.871
Find something like that.

01:44.871 --> 01:47.123
Keeping in mind I don't
care for sports arenas,

01:47.123 --> 01:49.375
theme parks or miniature golf.

01:49.375 --> 01:51.161
All right, young lady, you just prepare

01:51.161 --> 01:53.913
to be swept off your
feet tomorrow night.

01:53.913 --> 01:57.250
I already have been.

01:57.250 --> 01:59.252
Bon soir, mon coeur.

02:00.637 --> 02:02.639
R-Right, right.

02:17.153 --> 02:18.154
Ugh.

02:18.154 --> 02:20.156
I'll get another one.

02:21.157 --> 02:25.111
(piano plays)

02:25.111 --> 02:27.497
? Making your way in the world today ?

02:27.497 --> 02:30.500
? Takes everything you've got ?

02:30.500 --> 02:33.503
? Taking a break from all your worries ?

02:33.503 --> 02:36.506
? Sure would help a lot ?

02:36.506 --> 02:41.878
? Wouldn't you like to get away? ?

02:41.878 --> 02:44.797
? Sometimes you want to go ?

02:44.797 --> 02:49.802
? Where everybody knows your name ?

02:49.802 --> 02:54.807
? And they're always glad you came ?

02:54.807 --> 02:56.809
? You want to be where you can see ?

02:56.809 --> 02:59.812
? Our troubles are all the same ?

02:59.812 --> 03:04.817
? You want to be where
everybody knows your name ?

03:04.817 --> 03:07.820
? You want to go where people know ?

03:07.820 --> 03:09.822
? People are all the same ?

03:10.323 --> 03:14.827
? You want to go where
everybody knows your name. ?

03:34.647 --> 03:36.149
Good afternoon, everybody.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.150
ALL: Norm.

03:37.650 --> 03:38.651
Hey, Mr. Peterson.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.519
What's the story?

03:39.519 --> 03:40.853
Boy meets beer.

03:40.853 --> 03:41.854
Boy drinks beer.

03:41.854 --> 03:45.358
Boy gets another beer.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.359
Uh,

03:46.359 --> 03:48.861
boy, have I got an
evening cooked up for us.

03:48.861 --> 03:50.363
Yeah? thanks for thinking of me, Cliffy,

03:50.363 --> 03:52.365
but, uh, I think I better
get home early today.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.866
What?

03:53.866 --> 03:55.868
Yeah, Vera's getting
home from Springfield,

03:55.868 --> 03:57.370
and I thought a special elegant meal

03:57.370 --> 03:59.872
would be the proper way to
welcome her home, you know.

03:59.872 --> 04:00.873
How thoughtful, Norm.

04:00.873 --> 04:01.874
Say, what's on the menu?

04:01.874 --> 04:03.376
Yeah, whatever she
feels like whipping up

04:03.876 --> 04:04.877
after a five-hour bus trip.

04:04.877 --> 04:05.878
Oh.

04:05.878 --> 04:06.879
SAM: Hey Woody,

04:06.879 --> 04:08.381
didn't you say you'd been to this,

04:08.381 --> 04:09.882
uh, Le Petit Orange Restaurant?

04:09.882 --> 04:11.884
Yeah. CLIFF: Hey, Woody,

04:11.884 --> 04:13.886
you been to that, uh, fancy joint, eh?

04:13.886 --> 04:15.388
Yeah, a couple of times. Yeah?

04:15.388 --> 04:17.390
Yeah, well, how was it?
Did they treat you well?

04:17.390 --> 04:18.391
I didn't eat there.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.892
I just went in to use the men's room.

04:20.892 --> 04:23.396
Well, the-the restaurant
part-- did it look like a...

04:23.396 --> 04:26.282
a nice romantic place to take a lady?

04:26.282 --> 04:27.734
Well, who could tell, Sam?

04:27.734 --> 04:28.735
It's real dark in there,

04:28.735 --> 04:29.736
and they got this guy

04:29.736 --> 04:31.237
running around playing a violin.

04:31.237 --> 04:32.739
SAM: Oh, no.

04:32.739 --> 04:35.041
I bet they got those
pictures of those guys

04:35.041 --> 04:37.043
that are half men,
half horse, too, right?

04:37.043 --> 04:38.411
I'm glad you said that, Sam.

04:38.911 --> 04:41.414
I thought I was seeing things.

04:41.414 --> 04:43.416
I've been racking my brains all day

04:43.416 --> 04:44.417
trying to find a place

04:44.417 --> 04:45.918
that's out of the ordinary

04:45.918 --> 04:47.420
and classy for dinner tonight.

04:47.420 --> 04:49.922
How about a nude barbecue?

04:51.424 --> 04:53.926
No. It's kind of dangerous
with all those sparks.

04:54.427 --> 04:55.428
Oh, right.

04:55.428 --> 04:57.680
Uh, well, what's the
occasion there, Stretch?

04:57.680 --> 04:59.432
Well, let's just...

04:59.432 --> 05:01.934
Let's just say it's a special evening

05:01.934 --> 05:04.437
for a special lady.

05:04.437 --> 05:05.938
Ooh! Get out your scorecards, boys.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.440
Sounds like Sammy's back in action.

05:07.440 --> 05:08.441
Yeah! Yeah!

05:08.441 --> 05:09.942
FRASIER: I, uh, take it this means

05:09.942 --> 05:11.194
you've terminated

05:11.194 --> 05:13.029
your relationship with
Councilor Eldridge.

05:13.029 --> 05:15.031
Ooh, yeah, in-in the dumper.

05:15.031 --> 05:16.532
CLIFF: Well, gentlemen,

05:16.532 --> 05:18.534
in memory of the
Councilor, may I suggest

05:18.534 --> 05:20.536
we lower our cocktail
napkins to half mast, huh?

05:20.536 --> 05:23.923
Yes, let's not forget the
traditional 21-peanut salute.

05:23.923 --> 05:25.091
Oh, no.

05:30.179 --> 05:31.681
Sammy, another round for the back?

05:31.681 --> 05:34.600
Yeah, but I want to know
who's the lucky lady tonight.

05:34.600 --> 05:35.601
CLIFF: Yeah, come on, Sammy.

05:35.601 --> 05:37.103
You'll-You'll find out soon enough.

05:37.103 --> 05:38.604
Just come on, help me
think of a place here.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.556
Well, all right, Sam, I-I got something

05:40.556 --> 05:42.058
that might be just the ticket for you.

05:42.058 --> 05:43.059
How about this?

05:43.059 --> 05:45.561
A sailboat anchored offshore,

05:45.561 --> 05:47.447
you know, chilled champagne,

05:47.447 --> 05:48.364
candlelit dinner

05:48.364 --> 05:50.233
underneath the stars, huh?

05:50.233 --> 05:52.985
Worked great for Sean and Madonna.

05:54.620 --> 05:57.907
Where do you hear all this stupid stuff?

05:57.907 --> 05:59.409
Let's just say

05:59.409 --> 06:01.911
inquiring minds want to know, huh.

06:03.796 --> 06:05.081
A sailboat. That's a good idea.

06:05.081 --> 06:07.467
Maybe I'll call and
see if I can rent one.

06:08.835 --> 06:10.219
Hey, Sam,

06:10.219 --> 06:12.088
I just remembered something
that might help you.

06:12.088 --> 06:13.089
What's that?

06:13.089 --> 06:14.590
Now my Uncle Wade was a master

06:15.091 --> 06:17.093
at putting women in a romantic mood.

06:17.093 --> 06:18.094
Well, what-what'd he do?

06:18.094 --> 06:19.095
Gave 'em money.

06:19.095 --> 06:20.596
Worked like a charm.

06:21.597 --> 06:23.099
Uh, thank you, Woody,

06:23.099 --> 06:24.600
but I'm looking for a place

06:24.600 --> 06:27.103
to take someone, a-a
very special place.

06:27.103 --> 06:28.104
As a matter of fact, come here.

06:28.104 --> 06:29.605
Can you keep a secret?

06:29.605 --> 06:32.992
Can I keep a secret?

06:32.992 --> 06:34.994
You still don't know Carla leaves early

06:34.994 --> 06:35.995
on your night off, do you?

06:37.497 --> 06:39.499
Good, good.

06:39.499 --> 06:41.000
Listen, I'm only telling you this

06:41.000 --> 06:43.503
because I-I like you,
and I... and I trust you.

06:43.503 --> 06:45.872
I'm thinking about proposing.

06:45.872 --> 06:49.792
Oh, well, Sam, I'm flattered, but...

06:53.296 --> 06:55.298
You probably don't mean me, huh?

06:55.298 --> 06:57.183
We'll talk later.

06:58.968 --> 07:01.471
Boy, oh, boy, I wouldn't
mind being a barnacle

07:01.471 --> 07:04.357
on the rudder of Sam's sailboat,
if you know what I mean.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.142
I'm sure you'd be better-looking,

07:06.142 --> 07:07.143
but would you be happier?

07:08.528 --> 07:09.979
Ooh.

07:09.979 --> 07:11.481
NORM: Woody, are you in pain, buddy?

07:11.481 --> 07:12.982
No, I was just thinking.

07:12.982 --> 07:15.485
Yeah, well, the first
time's always the worst.

07:19.372 --> 07:22.208
Who do you think Sam's
gonna propose to tonight?

07:22.208 --> 07:25.161
What're you babbling
about, Billy Bob Joe Jim?

07:25.161 --> 07:26.662
Well, Sam said

07:26.662 --> 07:29.165
he was gonna propose to someone.

07:29.165 --> 07:30.666
FRASIER: That's odd.

07:30.666 --> 07:32.668
He said he broke up
with Councilor Eldridge.

07:33.169 --> 07:35.421
Who could he possibly be
talking about proposing to?

07:37.256 --> 07:39.258
(Frasier and Carla scream)

07:41.260 --> 07:43.763
You've chosen the most beautiful spot

07:43.763 --> 07:45.765
in which to anchor.

07:45.765 --> 07:49.268
Everything's absolutely perfect.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.273
This is the most wonderful
idea any man ever came up with.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.775
(chuckles)

07:55.775 --> 07:57.777
Who came up with it?

07:57.777 --> 07:59.278
Come on, give me some credit.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.280
I have an original thought now and then.

08:01.280 --> 08:03.282
You're right. I'm sorry.

08:03.282 --> 08:04.667
Was it Frasier?

08:04.667 --> 08:07.620
Actually, it was Cliff.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.122
Well, okay then, don't tell me.

08:11.123 --> 08:12.625
(giggles)

08:12.625 --> 08:16.128
Right now I'm having a
rather unoriginal thought.

08:25.638 --> 08:27.139
Are you as happy as I?

08:27.139 --> 08:28.641
Oh, yeah.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.643
I just wish I could get this song

08:30.643 --> 08:31.644
out of my head.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.145
Song?

08:33.645 --> 08:36.032
Yeah. You-You know how

08:36.032 --> 08:38.818
sometimes you connect certain places

08:38.818 --> 08:41.320
and things with certain songs?

08:41.320 --> 08:44.824
Oh, I know exactly what you mean.

08:44.824 --> 08:45.825
Thank you.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.326
This may sound a bit pretentious,

08:47.326 --> 08:49.829
but every time I'm in a taxi,

08:49.829 --> 08:54.333
I can't help but hum "Dove
Sono" from Le Nozze Di Figaro

08:54.333 --> 08:57.837
simply because once a
rather zaftig Parisian cabbie

08:57.837 --> 09:00.339
sang the entire aria on a trip

09:00.339 --> 09:01.841
through Montparnasse to La Coupole.

09:01.841 --> 09:03.226
(laughs)

09:03.226 --> 09:06.512
Anyway, whenever I get
out on the water like this,

09:06.512 --> 09:09.515
I can't help thinking about this tune.

09:09.515 --> 09:13.519
Uh, Cappy Johnny, the old
sailor who taught me how to sail

09:13.519 --> 09:16.022
used to whistle it all the time.

09:16.022 --> 09:18.524
(whistles "Popeye the Sailor Man")

09:22.912 --> 09:24.413
"Popeye the Sailor Man?"

09:24.413 --> 09:26.699
You know it?

09:26.699 --> 09:28.584
Oh, yes.

09:28.584 --> 09:31.454
Well, that one haunts me, too.

09:31.454 --> 09:33.339
May I propose a toast?

09:33.339 --> 09:34.840
Indeed you may.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.842
No, no, a, uh, shrimp toast.

09:36.842 --> 09:39.345
A shrimp toast is even better.

09:39.345 --> 09:40.713
Hmm.

09:40.713 --> 09:43.049
To us.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.051
How eloquent.

09:45.051 --> 09:47.553
To us.

09:55.061 --> 09:58.564
(laughs)

09:58.564 --> 10:00.066
Boy, us.

10:00.066 --> 10:01.567
(laughs) Mm.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.069
What a pair, huh?

10:03.069 --> 10:07.073
The important thing is that

10:07.073 --> 10:09.575
this finally seems right.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.576
Yeah.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.078
I'm so happy about us.

10:12.078 --> 10:15.581
I feel so good.

10:15.581 --> 10:19.085
To think I almost let you
get away because of Janet.

10:19.585 --> 10:24.090
Well, you had some crazy
notion you cared about her.

10:24.090 --> 10:25.591
Well, hey, if it weren't for Janet,

10:25.591 --> 10:28.594
I wouldn't be here right now.

10:28.594 --> 10:31.981
Which reminds me, I guess I better...

10:31.981 --> 10:34.850
better get to why I came
here in the first place.

10:36.852 --> 10:38.854
Can you, uh, give me some room here?

10:38.854 --> 10:41.357
Oh, oh, yes, indeed.

10:41.357 --> 10:42.858
Mm. Ha, ha!

10:42.858 --> 10:44.860
(laughs)

10:48.114 --> 10:49.115
You know, for the longest time,

10:49.115 --> 10:53.619
I kept pretending about you.

10:53.619 --> 10:58.124
I guess I was afraid to
really admit my feelings.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.126
But from the very start,

11:00.126 --> 11:01.627
down deep inside,

11:01.627 --> 11:04.013
I have been crazy about you.

11:04.013 --> 11:04.880
Crazier about you

11:05.381 --> 11:06.382
than any other woman I've ever met.

11:06.882 --> 11:08.384
I mean, hell, I was crazy about you

11:08.384 --> 11:09.385
even when I hated you.

11:09.385 --> 11:12.388
(laughing)

11:15.391 --> 11:18.277
What I'm trying to say is...

11:18.277 --> 11:21.063
will you marry me?

11:22.565 --> 11:24.066
No.

11:26.569 --> 11:28.070
No?

11:29.071 --> 11:31.323
No.

11:32.124 --> 11:34.126
Are you serious?

11:34.126 --> 11:35.127
I'm afraid I am.

11:41.634 --> 11:46.138
Well...

11:46.138 --> 11:50.142
seems to me you have two choices.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.144
One, I can throw you in,

11:52.144 --> 11:53.646
or two, you can jump in.

11:53.646 --> 11:54.513
Sam, I warn you...

11:54.513 --> 11:56.148
It's very simple.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.817
One or two. Sam, you haven't...

11:57.817 --> 12:00.653
It's not open for debate, Diane.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.906
Sam, I think after you've
heard my explanation,

12:03.906 --> 12:05.324
you won't...

12:13.833 --> 12:17.336
Sam, throw me a line, please?!

12:17.336 --> 12:19.338
Okay.

12:19.338 --> 12:22.842
What's a nice girl like you
doing in an ocean like this?

12:23.843 --> 12:25.845
Sam!

12:35.187 --> 12:38.774
(dishes banging)

12:38.774 --> 12:40.276
What are you doing?

12:40.276 --> 12:41.777
SAM: The dishes!

12:41.777 --> 12:44.280
(dishes banging)

12:44.280 --> 12:46.782
Sam... calm down.

12:46.782 --> 12:47.783
You're upset.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.785
Only that I fished you out.

12:50.786 --> 12:53.289
I know my answer was unexpected...

12:53.289 --> 12:54.200
Unexpected. No, no.

12:54.290 --> 12:55.200
Don't be silly.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.292
I brought you out here
so I could be dumped

12:56.292 --> 12:58.294
with a nautical theme.

12:58.294 --> 12:59.295
(grunts)

13:00.296 --> 13:02.798
(glass shattering)

13:02.798 --> 13:04.800
(dishes banging)

13:05.301 --> 13:08.804
Sam... if you'll stop
that for a moment...

13:08.804 --> 13:10.306
if you'll stop that for a moment,

13:10.306 --> 13:12.808
I'll try and explain... my answer.

13:13.809 --> 13:15.311
Are you done?

13:15.811 --> 13:17.813
Maybe.

13:18.814 --> 13:21.317
All right, then.

13:22.318 --> 13:25.821
As it happens, I came out
here with every intention

13:26.322 --> 13:30.326
of... accepting your proposal...

13:30.326 --> 13:33.329
but when you spoke of Janet, I...

13:33.829 --> 13:37.333
had this enormous pang of doubt.

13:38.334 --> 13:39.835
"What if wanting to get married

13:40.336 --> 13:43.339
"is a knee-jerk reaction to losing her?

13:44.340 --> 13:47.343
Does he want me or just someone?"

13:50.212 --> 13:52.131
Oh, Sam, I want it so much,

13:52.131 --> 13:56.135
but I have to be free of
doubt before I can say yes.

13:58.637 --> 14:00.639
Sam?

14:06.979 --> 14:08.981
Did you notice that?

14:10.983 --> 14:12.484
Notice what?

14:12.484 --> 14:16.488
Everything just got calm.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.992
I don't notice any difference.

14:19.992 --> 14:20.993
Oh, yes, yes.

14:20.993 --> 14:23.495
There's a difference in everything.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.998
The whole world just changed for me.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.001
Oh!

14:29.001 --> 14:30.002
Look!

14:30.002 --> 14:33.005
The stars are new.

14:33.389 --> 14:36.308
The moon is new.

14:37.226 --> 14:40.729
Sam Malone is new, and I like him.

14:40.729 --> 14:44.233
And I like them, and they like me.

14:44.233 --> 14:46.735
And none of us like you.

14:50.239 --> 14:52.241
Am I going overboard again?

14:52.241 --> 14:54.743
No, no, no, don't be silly.

14:54.743 --> 14:57.746
That would mean I care, and I don't.

14:57.746 --> 14:59.248
Bye-bye, Diane.

14:59.248 --> 15:00.249
Where are you going?

15:00.249 --> 15:01.250
I'm going to swim ashore.

15:01.250 --> 15:03.252
You can't do that.

15:03.252 --> 15:06.255
Very well... I'll take the dinghy.

15:06.255 --> 15:09.758
You... See how quickly
the new Sam adjusts?

15:11.260 --> 15:14.763
You're going to just leave
me out here all alone?

15:14.763 --> 15:16.682
Yes, I am.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.686
Sam. Sam Malone.

15:20.686 --> 15:22.187
If you leave me out here all alone,

15:22.187 --> 15:25.190
you are the most despicable
creature on Earth!

15:25.190 --> 15:29.695
Well, I yam what I yam,
and that's all what I yam.

15:29.695 --> 15:31.947
(whistling "Popeye the Sailor Man")

15:40.406 --> 15:41.874
Hello, Mr. Clavin.

15:41.874 --> 15:45.377
Hey, Woodrow. Uh, suds du jour, please.

15:47.329 --> 15:48.330
Oh, there he is!

15:48.330 --> 15:49.832
Normie, eh!

15:49.832 --> 15:52.217
So, uh, Vera get home from
Springfield last night, huh?

15:52.217 --> 15:53.218
Yep. Yeah, yeah?

15:53.218 --> 15:54.720
So, uh, how'd it go?

15:54.720 --> 15:56.221
Well, I'll tell you, Cliff,

15:56.221 --> 15:58.724
it got pretty hot in
our bedroom last night.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.092
CLIFF: Whoo-hoo!

16:00.092 --> 16:02.928
Yeah, yeah? Air conditioning broke down.

16:05.431 --> 16:07.149
EVERYONE: Hey, hey!

16:07.149 --> 16:08.434
The lucky fella.

16:08.434 --> 16:09.935
Let me get this over with.

16:10.436 --> 16:13.822
Uh, I asked her. She
said no. End of bulletin.

16:19.445 --> 16:21.830
CARLA: Sorry, Sam.

16:21.830 --> 16:23.699
I feel like dirt.

16:23.699 --> 16:25.200
I'm fine, everybody.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.202
I just don't want to
talk about it, that's all.

16:27.202 --> 16:29.204
Can I talk to you just for a minute?

16:30.205 --> 16:32.708
Sure, Sam. What can I do you for?

16:32.708 --> 16:35.711
Well...

16:35.711 --> 16:39.214
I'm kind of worried
that Diane may get hurt.

16:39.214 --> 16:42.134
My God, Sam, that is very noble of you.

16:42.134 --> 16:43.635
No, I-I mean that I...

16:44.136 --> 16:48.140
I had a dream last night
that I killed her...

16:48.140 --> 16:52.144
and-and-and-and it
felt really good.

16:54.146 --> 16:56.148
Does this mean I'm-I'm crazy or...?

16:56.148 --> 16:58.150
No, no, of course not.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.070
It's very normal for most sane people

17:01.070 --> 17:03.572
to entertain insane impulses sometimes,

17:03.572 --> 17:06.075
and it's very natural
to want to hurt someone

17:06.075 --> 17:07.076
that's rejected you.

17:07.076 --> 17:09.545
Well, for example...

17:09.545 --> 17:11.329
Well, there's me.

17:12.664 --> 17:14.665
But I can't tell you
how many times I felt

17:14.665 --> 17:17.553
my own hands around her windpipe...

17:17.553 --> 17:20.305
strangling her...

17:20.305 --> 17:22.808
fingers tightening...

17:22.808 --> 17:25.310
cartilage snapping!

17:26.729 --> 17:30.516
And, uh, I'm a respected psychiatrist.

17:33.936 --> 17:37.322
Look, Sam, you've been through
an emotional meat grinder.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.775
My best advice to you is get away,

17:39.775 --> 17:43.662
relax... reflect on what's happened.

17:43.662 --> 17:45.998
You know, I still have the boat
rented for a couple of days.

17:45.998 --> 17:49.001
I guess I could sail up to Marblehead.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.003
Great. Cool it out there.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.505
Thank you. You know, maybe
I'll work on the old tan.

17:53.505 --> 17:56.008
Terrific. It'll be just
what the doctor ordered, Sam:

17:56.008 --> 17:59.378
sun, salt air, ocean spray in your face.

17:59.378 --> 18:01.680
I know I-I wish I could come with you.

18:01.680 --> 18:03.549
Well, I wish I could ask.

18:03.549 --> 18:04.299
I understand.

18:05.801 --> 18:08.554
Ooh, boy, how 'bout that Diane, huh?

18:08.554 --> 18:10.355
Eh, just like all women.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.808
If they're not turnin' down
your proposal of marriage,

18:12.808 --> 18:15.727
they're... they're accusin'
you of suspicious behavior

18:15.727 --> 18:17.729
in the lingerie changin' room.

18:24.403 --> 18:26.288
Oh, uh, hello, Diane.

18:26.288 --> 18:27.790
Norman.

18:27.790 --> 18:29.158
Excuse me, miss,

18:29.158 --> 18:31.994
aren't you confusing
this bar with the one

18:31.994 --> 18:34.496
where everyone isn't
repulsed by your presence?

18:37.883 --> 18:39.885
Oh, Frasier, please
tell me where Sam is.

18:39.885 --> 18:41.386
I have to talk with him.

18:41.386 --> 18:45.390
Diane... in light of your
disposal of him last night,

18:45.390 --> 18:48.393
I think it's better that
he be left alone right now.

18:48.393 --> 18:50.395
That poor man.

18:50.395 --> 18:52.397
Can you imagine how he must feel?

18:52.397 --> 18:54.900
Gee, I'll try.

19:02.407 --> 19:04.910
Of course. I'm sorry.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.912
It's just that I'm so distraught.

19:06.912 --> 19:08.914
I fear I've made a terrible mistake.

19:08.914 --> 19:11.917
Sam's instincts were superior to my own.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.418
He was right, and I was wrong.

19:13.418 --> 19:14.786
I should've said yes.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.255
You're running back to him?

19:16.255 --> 19:18.006
If he'll have me. I...

19:18.006 --> 19:23.846
Oh... my neck is so stiff
from that water last night.

19:23.846 --> 19:26.348
Would you give me one
of your special massages?

19:26.348 --> 19:28.350
Please? Please, please, please?

19:28.350 --> 19:29.852
Certainly. Thank you.

19:32.855 --> 19:36.859
I was such a fool out
in that boat last night.

19:36.859 --> 19:38.360
(sighs)

19:38.360 --> 19:39.361
When I told him no,

19:39.361 --> 19:42.364
I was listening to my
head and not my heart.

19:42.364 --> 19:44.366
I should've known.

19:44.366 --> 19:48.370
Sam and I are inevitable.

19:49.371 --> 19:52.374
Why fight it?

19:52.374 --> 19:54.376
Why fight it?

19:55.377 --> 19:58.380
Why fight it?

19:58.380 --> 19:59.882
Frasier...

20:01.800 --> 20:02.801
You don't mind me talking to you

20:03.302 --> 20:04.300
about this, do you?

20:04.303 --> 20:05.804
No, no, no, no.

20:05.804 --> 20:07.306
Uh, I'm happy for you. Feels better.

20:07.306 --> 20:08.807
Thank you. Good, good.

20:08.807 --> 20:10.309
No, I'm-I'm really happy for you.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.811
Uh, Diane, I think it's
wise to go to him now.

20:12.811 --> 20:13.812
Yes. Uh, right-right now.

20:14.313 --> 20:16.815
Yes, yes, right... Where is he?

20:16.815 --> 20:18.317
Oh, uh...

20:18.317 --> 20:20.819
(laughing): He, uh,
he, uh, took the boat

20:20.819 --> 20:23.689
to Marblehead. Oh, thank you, Frasier.

20:23.689 --> 20:27.943
I'll wait till tonight
and motor out to the boat.

20:27.943 --> 20:29.444
Yes. Oh, this is perfect.

20:29.444 --> 20:31.947
Sam will already be asleep,
and I'll slip into bed

20:31.947 --> 20:34.449
beside him and give him
the surprise of his life.

20:34.449 --> 20:35.367
Eh, uh, Diane?

20:35.367 --> 20:37.252
Sam's nose is, uh, pushed

20:37.252 --> 20:39.538
out of joint, and I think
you better let him cool down.

20:39.538 --> 20:42.507
Oh, don't be silly. He proposed.

20:42.507 --> 20:46.511
You can't turn off
emotions like a spigot.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.513
Besides, making up has always been

20:49.014 --> 20:51.016
the cornerstone of our relationship.

20:51.016 --> 20:52.517
You know, that's...

20:52.517 --> 20:54.970
that's what I always loved
about the two of you, Diane.

20:54.970 --> 20:56.972
That's-that's beautiful, really.

20:56.972 --> 20:58.724
You and Sam are magic.

20:58.724 --> 21:01.059
I should've killed her
while I had the chance.

21:08.650 --> 21:09.651
Hey, everybody.

21:09.651 --> 21:11.653
Sam!

21:11.653 --> 21:13.155
Thought you were on the high seas.

21:13.155 --> 21:14.656
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

21:14.656 --> 21:16.658
I decided the best way
to forget about Diane

21:17.159 --> 21:19.161
was to start dating some babes

21:19.161 --> 21:23.165
long on legs and short on syllables.

21:23.165 --> 21:25.167
Sounds like a good plan, too.

21:25.167 --> 21:27.169
Besides, I ran into
an old friend of mine,

21:27.669 --> 21:29.171
Monsignor Demarest.

21:29.671 --> 21:30.672
He needed to relax a little bit,

21:30.672 --> 21:32.674
so I sent him out to
Marblehead on the boat.

21:32.674 --> 21:34.676
Oh, my God!

21:34.676 --> 21:36.178
What?

21:37.179 --> 21:39.097
Nothing.

21:42.017 --> 21:43.068
Nothing.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.070
Oh.

21:48.573 --> 21:49.941
(engine shuts off)

21:49.941 --> 21:52.911
Thanks for the lift.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.916
(engine starts)

22:09.845 --> 22:13.348
(Diane and man screaming)

22:25.043 --> 22:26.912
Yes!

22:27.746 --> 22:29.631
Yes, what?

22:29.631 --> 22:32.551
Yes, I will marry you.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.554
Oh, oh, I see what's happening here.

22:35.554 --> 22:37.556
You-you're still under the assumption

22:37.556 --> 22:39.057
that that offer is still valid.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.058
No, no, no, no.

22:40.058 --> 22:43.061
The-the statute of limitations
on that proposal ran out

22:43.061 --> 22:45.931
the second your feet hit the water.

22:46.732 --> 22:50.235
In that case, may I
suggest you propose again?

22:50.235 --> 22:54.606
I assure you this time, I
will accept your proposal.

22:54.606 --> 22:57.909
Fine. I propose that you step
in front of a speeding bus.

22:57.909 --> 23:00.078
(all laughing)

23:00.078 --> 23:01.663
You know, and I...

23:01.663 --> 23:04.499
from now on, I'm
dedicating myself to life,

23:04.499 --> 23:06.001
liberty and the pursuit of every woman

23:06.001 --> 23:08.003
in Boston except that one,

23:08.003 --> 23:09.337
so, to celebrate,

23:09.337 --> 23:11.289
drinks are on the house.
Come on, everybody!

23:11.289 --> 23:13.792
(all cheering)

23:15.794 --> 23:17.295
Wh-What do you think you're doing?

23:17.295 --> 23:18.680
I'm going to work.

23:18.680 --> 23:21.183
I'll probably stop working
when we get married,

23:21.183 --> 23:23.185
but I need a little
money for my trousseau.

23:23.185 --> 23:26.438
Who knows when the first
little Malone will come along?

23:26.438 --> 23:29.274
Yeah, how do I say this clearly
enough to register with you?

23:29.274 --> 23:31.777
I'm buying everybody a drink
in this bar to seal the fact

23:31.777 --> 23:34.780
that you and I are through forever.

23:34.780 --> 23:37.282
Oh, come on, Sam, come on.

23:37.282 --> 23:39.785
Nobody believes that.

23:41.286 --> 23:42.788
Well, go ahead. Ask them.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.623
Yeah, all right, I will.

23:44.623 --> 23:46.458
Hey, turn around here
for a minute, guys.

23:46.458 --> 23:48.326
Now, after everything I just said,

23:48.326 --> 23:50.162
do you think that Diane and I

23:50.162 --> 23:53.415
will ever get back together again?

23:55.250 --> 23:58.253
Could I have my drink before I answer?

23:59.305 --> 24:05.780
