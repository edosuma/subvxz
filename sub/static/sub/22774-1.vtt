WEBVTT

00:32.595 --> 00:33.376
Good morning, Darcy!

00:33.476 --> 00:34.658
Good morning!

00:34.758 --> 00:36.099
You were supposed
to call me last night.

00:36.199 --> 00:38.141
I want to hear all about
your date with Oliver!

00:38.241 --> 00:39.823
And if there was
anything worth reporting,

00:39.923 --> 00:41.925
I would've called.

00:45.888 --> 00:47.510
The new Anthony
Cleaver Parks!

00:47.610 --> 00:49.712
Your copy's already
at the front register.

00:49.812 --> 00:51.354
Merry Christmas to me!

00:51.454 --> 00:53.396
I'd swear you just work here
for the employee discount.

00:53.496 --> 00:55.658
Nothing wrong with that.

00:56.819 --> 00:58.080
Hey Darcy!

00:58.180 --> 00:59.562
How's that look?

00:59.662 --> 01:01.043
It looks great, Josh.

01:01.143 --> 01:03.185
Except you misspelled
“featuring.”

01:06.909 --> 01:08.911
Aww man.

01:14.796 --> 01:16.178
Good morning, Terrence.

01:16.278 --> 01:18.620
My landlady made
peppermint fudge last night.

01:18.720 --> 01:20.061
Hmm?

01:20.161 --> 01:21.703
Peppermint fudge,
your favorite.

01:21.803 --> 01:24.045
Oh.
Thank you, Darcy.

01:25.447 --> 01:27.989
You okay?

01:28.089 --> 01:31.793
Look what arrived
in the mail yesterday.

01:31.893 --> 01:33.715
Books, Books, Books
has decided to have

01:33.815 --> 01:35.356
their own
Christmas Eve event.

01:35.456 --> 01:36.477
What?

01:36.577 --> 01:37.839
They stole our idea!

01:37.939 --> 01:39.400
Well, we don't have
the market cornered

01:39.500 --> 01:41.002
on Christmas
Eve events.

01:41.102 --> 01:42.163
Yes we do!

01:42.263 --> 01:43.724
Our Christmas Eve
is a tradition.

01:43.824 --> 01:46.927
They can't just
sweep in here and--

01:47.027 --> 01:49.170
Okay, this is an
exact copy of our event!

01:49.270 --> 01:50.451
No point in getting angry,

01:50.551 --> 01:52.213
because there's nothing
we can do about it.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.134
We'll just concentrate
on having our own

01:54.234 --> 01:57.017
wonderful Christmas here,
the way we do every year.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.939
But don't you
think we should--

01:59.039 --> 02:01.021
I think we should root
for all bookstores

02:01.121 --> 02:02.462
to be successful
these days.

02:02.562 --> 02:03.744
Even the competition.

02:03.844 --> 02:05.185
Okay.

02:05.285 --> 02:08.308
What kind of a name is
Books, Books, Books anyway?

02:08.407 --> 02:09.749
That I'll grant you.

02:09.848 --> 02:12.572
Now give me some of
that peppermint fudge.

02:13.573 --> 02:15.955
Your grandson is going
to love this, Mr. Farley.

02:16.055 --> 02:17.277
It was one of
my favorites.

02:17.377 --> 02:19.519
I remember his mother loved
it when she was his age.

02:19.619 --> 02:21.160
I'm so glad you
thought of it.

02:21.260 --> 02:22.882
See you guys on
Christmas Eve?

02:22.982 --> 02:24.324
We'd never miss it.

02:24.424 --> 02:25.845
Perfect!

02:25.945 --> 02:27.887
Just give me a moment
and I will get Josh

02:27.987 --> 02:29.809
to wrap this
up for you.

02:29.909 --> 02:31.611
You didn't give
him a chance!

02:31.711 --> 02:32.692
Who, Mr. Farley?

02:32.792 --> 02:35.374
No, Oliver last night.

02:35.474 --> 02:36.736
He doesn't read.

02:36.836 --> 02:38.697
You sent me on a date with
someone who doesn't read.

02:38.797 --> 02:40.219
What'd I miss?

02:40.319 --> 02:42.661
I sent Darcy out last
night with a very nice guy.

02:42.761 --> 02:44.063
But she won't
see him again

02:44.163 --> 02:46.425
because he can't
quote Charles Dickens.

02:46.525 --> 02:47.906
“I will honor Christmas
in my heart,

02:48.006 --> 02:49.708
and keep it
all the year.”

02:49.808 --> 02:51.430
See? Josh can
quote Dickens.

02:51.530 --> 02:53.151
Josh works at a bookstore.

02:53.251 --> 02:54.913
I'm willing to
hold out for a guy

02:55.013 --> 02:56.795
who gets as excited
about a new book as I do.

02:56.895 --> 02:59.317
Nobody gets as excited
about a new book as you do.

02:59.417 --> 03:02.320
Does it really take three of my
employees to gift wrap a book?

03:02.420 --> 03:05.003
Terrence, would you please tell
Darcy to be more adventurous?

03:05.103 --> 03:08.526
I think Darcy is as
adventurous as she wants to be.

03:08.626 --> 03:09.888
Thank you.

03:09.988 --> 03:12.770
I've got my friends,
I've got a job I love,

03:12.870 --> 03:14.292
and any time I
want adventure,

03:14.392 --> 03:16.954
I have a whole
store full of options.

03:18.476 --> 03:19.857
Here you go,
Mr. Farley.

03:19.957 --> 03:20.858
Thank you, Darcy.

03:20.958 --> 03:21.979
I'll see you at
the Christmas party.

03:22.079 --> 03:24.081
You bet.

03:54.270 --> 03:55.772
Ciao, bella!

03:55.872 --> 03:57.333
Check out Santa's helper!

03:57.433 --> 03:59.455
In Naples, we call
him “Babbo Natale.”

03:59.555 --> 04:02.338
Well, you do Babbo
Natale proud, Luigi.

04:02.438 --> 04:03.139
Grazie.

04:03.239 --> 04:04.701
What's for dinner?

04:04.801 --> 04:07.423
Manicotti, a side
of sauteed spinach,

04:07.523 --> 04:11.047
and for dessert,
apricot crostata.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.350
There's no way that's
only five dollars.

04:14.450 --> 04:16.712
For my favorite customer,
always five dollars.

04:16.812 --> 04:19.034
Thank you Luigi,
you're amazing.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.357
But if you keep doing this,
you'll go broke.

04:21.457 --> 04:24.239
And if I don't do it,
you're gonna starve!

04:24.339 --> 04:25.521
Thank you!

04:25.621 --> 04:26.482
Okay, ciao.

04:26.582 --> 04:27.563
Buona sera.

04:27.663 --> 04:29.665
Good night.

04:34.429 --> 04:37.132
Well dear,
how was your day?

04:37.232 --> 04:38.974
Busy day.

04:39.074 --> 04:41.136
Katherine was quite
disappointed to learn

04:41.236 --> 04:43.738
that her matchmaking skills
aren't all she hoped.

04:43.838 --> 04:46.861
Oh let me guess,
he wasn't a reader?

04:46.961 --> 04:48.223
Exactly!

04:48.323 --> 04:50.224
What am I supposed
to do with that?

04:50.324 --> 04:51.546
Oh!

04:51.646 --> 04:53.307
It also looks like our
biggest competitor is trying

04:53.407 --> 04:55.269
to compete with
Christmas Eve at Chaucer's.

04:55.369 --> 04:56.951
Well they're
foolish to try.

04:57.051 --> 04:59.674
Chaucer's is a
Philadelphia tradition.

04:59.774 --> 05:02.636
I think we might need to
step up our game this year.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.879
Have a gingerbread man.

05:04.979 --> 05:06.200
No thanks.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.983
Bite the head off,
it'll make you feel better.

05:16.630 --> 05:18.972
All right well, I'd
best get back to work.

05:19.072 --> 05:21.975
I'm stringing lights
on my Christmas tree.

05:22.075 --> 05:24.898
I thought you
did that already?

05:24.998 --> 05:26.700
It needed more.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.501
Of course it did.

05:28.601 --> 05:32.345
Well, I've got the new
Anthony Cleaver Parks book,

05:32.445 --> 05:35.548
and a tree with just
the right amount of lights.

05:35.648 --> 05:37.190
I'm gonna curl up
with my dinner,

05:37.290 --> 05:39.993
maybe a cup
of hot cider.

05:40.093 --> 05:42.035
And a few more
of those cookies.

05:42.135 --> 05:44.076
[Elevator door beeping]

05:44.176 --> 05:45.398
Oh, good night!

05:45.498 --> 05:47.500
Good night.

06:32.423 --> 06:34.005
How did you learn
to make these?

06:34.105 --> 06:35.446
Origami Made Easy.

06:35.546 --> 06:36.687
I picked it
up forever ago,

06:36.787 --> 06:38.369
always meant to do
something with it.

06:38.469 --> 06:40.291
Last night,
I finally did.

06:40.391 --> 06:42.453
You made all of
these last night?

06:42.553 --> 06:44.014
What can I say?
I'm crafty.

06:44.114 --> 06:45.936
I just wanna see you
channel that energy

06:46.036 --> 06:48.178
into something other
than reading and crafts,

06:48.278 --> 06:50.260
which is a fabulous
lifestyle if you're 70.

06:50.360 --> 06:51.341
Katherine!

06:51.441 --> 06:52.142
Wait, that's not even true.

06:52.242 --> 06:53.864
My grandma
is in her 70's

06:53.964 --> 06:55.425
and she takes
ballroom dancing lessons.

06:55.525 --> 06:56.787
I'm not doing that.

06:56.887 --> 06:58.428
Well...

06:58.528 --> 07:01.071
would you look at this?

07:01.171 --> 07:02.392
We're going big!

07:02.492 --> 07:03.994
This is beautiful!

07:04.094 --> 07:05.195
Thank you, Terrence.

07:05.295 --> 07:07.297
Can I borrow you
two for a second?

07:08.058 --> 07:09.239
When?

07:09.339 --> 07:11.881
Well, we're hoping
for the end of March.

07:11.981 --> 07:14.364
Wendy and I will be
doing some house hunting

07:14.464 --> 07:17.166
in San Francisco when
we're out there next week.

07:17.266 --> 07:19.369
But what'll
happen to the store?

07:19.469 --> 07:21.691
I'm hoping we can
find a general manager

07:21.791 --> 07:24.774
we trust to keep it
open, keep it going.

07:24.874 --> 07:26.736
Chaucer's has been
around for a long time

07:26.836 --> 07:28.577
and we wouldn't want
Books, Books, Books

07:28.677 --> 07:30.299
to be the only option
in the neighborhood.

07:30.399 --> 07:32.021
So you're not
selling the place?

07:32.121 --> 07:33.742
Well, we're open
to all possibilities.

07:33.842 --> 07:37.586
But the plan is to keep it
open under new management.

07:37.686 --> 07:41.430
Of course, if any of
you would like to apply,

07:41.530 --> 07:43.972
I would welcome
that conversation.

07:48.016 --> 07:50.238
We're really gonna
miss you, Terrence.

07:50.338 --> 07:52.681
Well it breaks my
heart to say goodbye,

07:52.781 --> 07:56.404
but the pull of grandchildren
is very powerful.

07:56.504 --> 07:58.086
I understand.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.089
I'm sorry to break this to you
all a week before Christmas,

08:01.189 --> 08:03.932
but since I'll be seeing
candidates for the job,

08:04.032 --> 08:05.573
I thought you
should know.

08:05.673 --> 08:07.215
Thanks for telling
us now, Terrence.

08:07.315 --> 08:09.337
So no long faces, okay?

08:09.437 --> 08:11.819
Let's just try and make
this the best Christmas Eve

08:11.919 --> 08:14.562
at Chaucer's we've
ever had, all right?

08:15.923 --> 08:17.625
I can't believe
Terrence is doing this.

08:17.725 --> 08:20.307
It's like he's
breaking up the family.

08:20.407 --> 08:21.589
We'll still be
a family, Darcy.

08:21.689 --> 08:24.031
We'll just have family
in San Francisco, too.

08:24.131 --> 08:25.552
But I mean around here.

08:25.652 --> 08:26.834
We grow the family.

08:26.934 --> 08:28.756
You know Terrence
will find someone great.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.858
Unless he
decides to sell.

08:32.219 --> 08:33.799
You don't think
he will, do you?

08:33.900 --> 08:35.282
He can't!

08:35.381 --> 08:37.244
Someone'll turn this building
into a yoga studio so fast--

08:37.344 --> 08:38.725
Not necessarily!

08:38.825 --> 08:41.006
Are these little books
made of matchboxes?

08:41.107 --> 08:44.049
Yeah, and now I've got
like three Ziploc baggies

08:44.150 --> 08:46.453
full of matches, so let
me know if you need any.

08:46.553 --> 08:48.895
I'll keep
that in mind.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.657
Or worse than
a yoga studio,

08:50.757 --> 08:53.540
it'll be like the third craft
microbrewery on the street.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.461
Or worse, they'll
just tear it down

08:55.561 --> 08:57.223
and turn it
into luxury condos.

08:57.323 --> 08:59.025
Darcy, everything
will be fine.

08:59.125 --> 09:02.668
This is someone's
dream job, I'm sure of it.

09:02.768 --> 09:04.190
You!

09:04.290 --> 09:05.471
You, Katherine!

09:05.571 --> 09:07.673
You're senior manager,
it should totally be you!

09:07.773 --> 09:09.115
I'm done with
grad school in May.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.757
I hope to be putting my
journalism degree to use.

09:11.857 --> 09:13.639
Terrence needs someone
that'll stick around,

09:13.739 --> 09:15.481
really love place.

09:15.581 --> 09:16.682
What about you?

09:16.782 --> 09:17.723
What about me?

09:17.823 --> 09:19.825
For the job!

09:20.866 --> 09:24.089
I don't know anything
about running a business.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.332
Think of all the thousands of
things that could go wrong if--

09:27.432 --> 09:30.675
There you go, right back
to the worst-case scenario.

09:33.038 --> 09:35.020
There's a doggy
in the window.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.122
I see that.

09:39.043 --> 09:41.506
And that doggy
has a person!

09:41.606 --> 09:43.928
I see that too.

09:51.856 --> 09:54.218
Come on, Bailey!

10:06.430 --> 10:07.731
Come on, Bailey.

10:07.831 --> 10:09.833
Looks like we're early.

10:25.809 --> 10:27.851
Hey, what's for dinner?

10:30.213 --> 10:32.275
Chicken picatta.

10:32.375 --> 10:34.317
Oh, I didn't
even think about you

10:34.417 --> 10:36.559
having a place
for your bicycle.

10:36.659 --> 10:39.682
I get such blinders on
when it comes to decorating.

10:39.782 --> 10:41.204
It's okay, I've got it.

10:41.304 --> 10:44.367
But if I come down tomorrow and
my bike is covered in tinsel...

10:44.467 --> 10:47.369
If it stands still long
enough, I decorate it.

10:47.469 --> 10:50.973
Speaking of which, I have a
beautiful star for your tree.

10:51.073 --> 10:52.815
Let's have dinner
together and hang it!

10:52.915 --> 10:54.917
I'd be delighted!

10:56.118 --> 10:58.120
Beautiful!

10:59.521 --> 11:01.523
Thank you.

11:02.324 --> 11:05.547
I think your
friend has a point.

11:05.647 --> 11:08.270
But I don't know the first
thing about managing a store.

11:08.370 --> 11:10.512
You have the most
important qualification.

11:10.612 --> 11:12.434
You love books.

11:12.534 --> 11:14.396
It's true, I do.

11:14.496 --> 11:17.859
But I like things
the way they are.

11:21.983 --> 11:23.925
I know my advice
doesn't mean much,

11:24.025 --> 11:25.646
I'm only your landlady.

11:25.746 --> 11:28.169
You are far more than
that and you know it.

11:28.269 --> 11:30.211
If you gave yourself
a bit more credit,

11:30.311 --> 11:34.895
you'd realize that you are tough
as nails and twice as sharp.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.257
I didn't meet your parents,

11:36.357 --> 11:39.980
but I know they'd say the
same thing if they could.

11:40.080 --> 11:41.702
You think so?

11:41.802 --> 11:43.223
Yes!

11:43.323 --> 11:45.305
A life embracing
possibilities

11:45.405 --> 11:47.788
is what every parent
wants for their child.

11:47.888 --> 11:50.310
Don't get me wrong,
I love my life,

11:50.410 --> 11:53.393
my friends, I just...

11:53.493 --> 11:55.916
I wish I could still--

11:56.016 --> 11:59.779
Still go to your
parents for advice?

12:01.901 --> 12:04.164
Oh sweetie, trust me.

12:04.264 --> 12:07.727
You never outgrow
that feeling.

12:07.827 --> 12:10.209
It's just easier when
I keep the big twists

12:10.309 --> 12:12.211
confined to my reading.

12:12.311 --> 12:15.575
In real life, I wanna know
what the day's going to bring.

12:15.675 --> 12:17.456
Where's the
excitement in that?

12:17.556 --> 12:20.179
The day brings
what it brings.

12:20.279 --> 12:21.861
You take what's given,

12:21.961 --> 12:25.564
and eventually you turn
it into something wonderful.

12:34.893 --> 12:36.074
What do you think, Bailey?

12:36.174 --> 12:38.176
Not bad, huh?

13:01.479 --> 13:06.484
[Cell phone ringing]

13:08.005 --> 13:09.106
Hello?

13:09.206 --> 13:11.529
You fell asleep
in your comfy chair.

13:12.610 --> 13:14.031
I fell asleep
in my comfy chair!

13:14.131 --> 13:15.072
You forgot to
set your alarm.

13:15.172 --> 13:16.273
I forgot to set my alarm!

13:16.373 --> 13:17.114
You are so late.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.216
I am so late!

13:19.937 --> 13:21.398
Hey, I just
got your message.

13:21.498 --> 13:23.160
I'm gonna take Bailey
out for a quick walk

13:23.260 --> 13:24.721
and then we're
gonna hit the road.

13:24.821 --> 13:26.823
Thanks for everything.

13:32.189 --> 13:34.191
Very funny,
Mrs. Henley!

13:54.810 --> 13:56.953
Come on boy.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.055
Let's go mail these.

14:28.843 --> 14:30.845
Look out!

14:52.786 --> 14:55.709
Excuse me, here's
your dog ma'am.

15:03.637 --> 15:04.978
Do you know where
they're taking him?

15:05.078 --> 15:07.080
Einstein Hospital.

15:23.016 --> 15:25.018
Hi.

15:28.701 --> 15:29.922
Bailey.

15:30.022 --> 15:32.024
Nice to meet you.

15:34.307 --> 15:37.129
Einstein Hospital,
that's only a few...

15:37.229 --> 15:39.231
miles.

15:40.112 --> 15:42.114
Feel like a walk?

15:51.563 --> 15:53.305
Okay.

15:53.405 --> 15:55.407
Come on boy!

16:15.386 --> 16:17.388
Darcy?

16:18.069 --> 16:19.410
Mr. Farley?

16:19.510 --> 16:20.812
What're you doing here?

16:20.912 --> 16:21.732
I'm here for
my grandson.

16:21.832 --> 16:22.854
He's having
his appendix out.

16:22.954 --> 16:23.814
How is he?

16:23.914 --> 16:25.096
They say it's a
simple procedure,

16:25.196 --> 16:26.777
but that doesn't do
much for the worry.

16:26.877 --> 16:29.140
I decided to come out
and get some fresh air.

16:29.240 --> 16:30.981
Need someone to keep an
eye on your friend there?

16:31.081 --> 16:33.584
Would you?
That would be so great!

16:33.684 --> 16:34.705
This is Bailey.

16:34.805 --> 16:36.226
I just met him,
it's a long story,

16:36.326 --> 16:38.188
but he seems
really friendly.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.631
Hey Bailey, I'm Bob.

16:40.731 --> 16:43.954
Care to keep me company?

16:44.054 --> 16:46.316
I think we'll
be fine out here.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.418
Thank you.

16:54.264 --> 16:55.205
Are you his wife?

16:55.305 --> 16:55.805
No.

16:55.905 --> 16:56.606
Sister?

16:56.706 --> 16:57.487
No.

16:57.587 --> 16:58.208
Mother?

16:58.308 --> 16:59.289
Really?

16:59.389 --> 17:00.970
Then I can't give
you any information.

17:01.070 --> 17:02.252
But I have his dog.

17:02.352 --> 17:04.354
As you've said repeatedly.

17:07.316 --> 17:08.858
Leave your name
and your number.

17:08.958 --> 17:12.101
As soon as I can, I will
let him know you stopped by.

17:12.201 --> 17:14.183
Thank you.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.906
But... what do
I do with Bailey?

17:17.006 --> 17:18.507
What you'd do
with any dog.

17:18.607 --> 17:19.868
Feed him, keep him happy

17:19.969 --> 17:22.590
and clean his paws after
you walk him in the snow.

17:22.691 --> 17:24.693
Thanks.

17:26.335 --> 17:29.118
Could you maybe
just tell me his name?

17:29.218 --> 17:31.580
I'm sorry hon,
I wish I could.

17:40.108 --> 17:42.891
I come bearing good news.

17:42.991 --> 17:48.977
It turns out you have a dog,
and his name is Bailey.

17:49.077 --> 17:52.200
Now, if we could just
find out what your name is.

18:14.101 --> 18:14.962
Darcy!

18:15.062 --> 18:16.724
You're home from
work early today!

18:16.824 --> 18:18.285
You wait here, I'll make
you something for lunch.

18:18.385 --> 18:21.328
That's okay Luigi, I just
would rather get home today.

18:21.428 --> 18:23.290
Look at the
little cagnolino!

18:23.390 --> 18:25.732
Hello, little fella!

18:25.832 --> 18:28.415
I'm watching him for
the day, for this guy.

18:28.515 --> 18:30.337
It's kind of a long story.

18:30.437 --> 18:32.419
La bicicletta,
what happened?

18:32.519 --> 18:34.781
Just a little accident.

18:34.881 --> 18:37.183
My nephew, he works
at the bicycle shop.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.705
on Frankford Avenue.

18:38.805 --> 18:40.386
You leave it
with me overnight,

18:40.486 --> 18:42.468
I have it back to
you like brand new.

18:42.568 --> 18:44.270
Luigi, you don't
have to do that.

18:44.370 --> 18:46.873
It's the season
for giving, yes?

18:46.973 --> 18:49.595
You look like you could use
some Christmas cheer too.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.237
It's been kind of a trying day.

18:51.337 --> 18:52.118
You come back later,

18:52.218 --> 18:53.639
I'll have some
tiramisu for you

18:53.739 --> 18:55.161
and I'm gonna
see if I can find

18:55.261 --> 18:57.002
a nice little treat
for the pup too, okay?

18:57.102 --> 18:57.963
Thank you.

18:58.063 --> 19:00.065
Okay.

19:01.066 --> 19:02.207
Thank you.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.048
Okay, come on Bailey!

19:03.148 --> 19:03.889
Ciao.

19:03.989 --> 19:05.991
Ciao!

19:07.232 --> 19:09.094
Okay, come on.

19:09.194 --> 19:11.196
Good boy.

19:14.439 --> 19:17.842
It's okay. Quiet!
It's okay, buddy.

19:20.405 --> 19:23.488
Did you trade your
bicycle for a dog?

19:24.729 --> 19:27.952
Did you put up more
Christmas decorations in here?

19:28.052 --> 19:29.794
I will ask the questions.

19:29.894 --> 19:32.277
What is a dog
doing in my building?

19:32.377 --> 19:33.798
It's the icicles, right?

19:33.898 --> 19:34.799
The perfect
finishing touch.

19:34.899 --> 19:36.400
You have such a good eye.

19:36.500 --> 19:42.967
Right now my good eye is looking
at a hairy dog in my vestibule.

19:43.067 --> 19:45.289
I hit his owner with my bike
and now he's in the hospital.

19:45.389 --> 19:46.410
It was an accident!

19:46.510 --> 19:48.252
Well I'm glad you
didn't do it on purpose.

19:48.352 --> 19:49.934
The nurse wouldn't
tell me the guy's name

19:50.034 --> 19:52.456
because I'm not family,
but then I had Bailey,

19:52.556 --> 19:53.817
that's the dog,
I know his name,

19:53.917 --> 19:55.459
and I didn't know
what to do with him,

19:55.559 --> 19:57.341
so I brought him
home and here we are.

19:57.441 --> 20:00.384
I'm sorry, I know
you don't like dogs.

20:00.484 --> 20:04.147
Such a thing to say!
I adore dogs.

20:04.247 --> 20:08.191
Oh, well then why
don't you allow pets?

20:08.291 --> 20:10.634
I had a tenant once
who raised ferrets.

20:10.734 --> 20:12.735
It was a situation!

20:14.097 --> 20:15.959

20:16.059 --> 20:17.520
one night.

20:17.620 --> 20:19.622

food for you in just a few...

We've got food and
treats, and look!

looks like a snow man!

only here for--

from the window!

night and his name is Bailey.

about mystery man?

21:12.393 --> 21:13.935

is missing.

his mail and his keys...

Okay Bailey.

Looks like he was
sending Christmas cards.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.113
Should we drop
them in the mail?

21:33.213 --> 21:34.875

call me to check on Bailey?

He's got really good taste.

In girlfriends?

24:06.681 --> 24:07.983

This is cashmere.

Did you see all those

headed on a trip.

24:22.617 --> 24:25.440
Well, that explains the total

25:36.728 --> 25:38.310
and let Bailey visit.

25:38.410 --> 25:41.833
I'm sorry I couldn't give you
more information this morning,

25:41.933 --> 25:44.036
but I'm bound
by confidentiality

25:44.136 --> 25:46.678
and I had to ask
his permission first.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.780
I completely understand.

25:49.901 --> 25:52.003
He took a hit to the head,

25:52.103 --> 25:54.286
and he's having
some memory problems,

25:54.386 --> 25:57.609
which is not unusual.

25:57.709 --> 26:00.692
Is Mr. Anderson
going to be okay?

26:00.792 --> 26:02.654
I thought you
didn't know him.

26:02.754 --> 26:05.336
I did a little detective work.

26:05.436 --> 26:07.698
Well, he'll be happy to
hear that you know his name.

26:07.798 --> 26:10.261
Why's that?

26:10.361 --> 26:13.204
Well, at the moment,
he doesn't...

26:25.536 --> 26:28.238
So he doesn't know
who he is?

26:28.338 --> 26:30.040
Retrograde amnesia.

26:30.140 --> 26:33.283
It's a loss of
autobiographical memory.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.126
It's a side effect of
swelling on the brain.

26:36.226 --> 26:40.010
Once the swelling subsides,
memories can gradually return.

26:40.110 --> 26:42.692
They can, or they do?

26:42.792 --> 26:44.694
It's different
for everyone.

26:44.794 --> 26:46.176
You're certain of his name?

26:46.276 --> 26:48.618
Yes, I found his address
on his Christmas cards.

26:48.718 --> 26:51.301
I went by his house earlier
to see if anyone was home.

26:51.401 --> 26:53.623
His name is
William Anderson.

26:53.723 --> 26:55.705
We believe that if a
thread of memory appears,

26:55.805 --> 26:57.386
it's best to pick
it up and follow it,

26:57.486 --> 26:58.628
see where it goes.

26:58.728 --> 27:01.470
And Mr. Anderson
remembers Bailey,

27:01.570 --> 27:03.472
which is already
a good sign.

27:03.572 --> 27:05.574
Okay.

27:06.535 --> 27:08.537
Come on.

27:09.498 --> 27:11.080
You have a visitor.

27:11.180 --> 27:13.162
Bailey!

27:13.262 --> 27:15.264
Hey!

27:16.024 --> 27:20.649
Does the name William
Anderson mean anything to you?

27:20.749 --> 27:23.572
Yeah, actually that
sounds very familiar.

27:23.672 --> 27:26.254
Is it possible
that's your name?

27:26.354 --> 27:28.577
I think...

27:28.677 --> 27:29.538
Aiden.

27:29.638 --> 27:31.539
I keep thinking
of the name Aiden.

27:31.639 --> 27:32.661
I'm fairly certain that--

27:32.761 --> 27:34.662
The middle initial is “A.”

27:34.762 --> 27:37.185
William A. Anderson.

27:37.285 --> 27:40.068
I think people
call me Aiden.

27:40.168 --> 27:42.110
William Aiden Anderson.

27:42.210 --> 27:43.871
That's a good name.

27:43.971 --> 27:45.953
Then why is it
that my dog's name

27:46.053 --> 27:48.115
sounds more familiar
to me than my own?

27:48.215 --> 27:49.637
Well, it's not unusual.

27:49.737 --> 27:52.680
Think about how many times a
day you say your pet's name.

27:52.780 --> 27:54.642
Details come back
in their own way,

27:54.742 --> 27:57.004
in their own time.

27:57.104 --> 28:00.207
Aiden, this is Darcy Archer.

28:00.307 --> 28:02.369
She's been taking
care of Bailey.

28:02.469 --> 28:03.210
Hi.

28:03.310 --> 28:04.571
Hi!

28:04.671 --> 28:06.673
I really
appreciate you--

28:07.794 --> 28:10.217
You look so familiar to me.

28:10.317 --> 28:12.939
Do we know each other?

28:13.039 --> 28:14.541
Nurse Nancy,
could I have a moment?

28:14.641 --> 28:16.643
Of course.

28:26.092 --> 28:27.113
Darcy.

28:27.213 --> 28:31.758
As in Mr. Darcy from
Pride and Prejudice?

28:31.858 --> 28:33.599
As a matter of fact, yes.

28:33.699 --> 28:36.142
It was my mother's
favorite book.

28:37.903 --> 28:39.445
I'm sorry,
this is so surreal.

28:39.545 --> 28:41.007
I feel like I know you.

28:41.107 --> 28:42.168
Are we friends?

28:42.268 --> 28:43.849
Wait, are we related?

28:43.949 --> 28:48.814
I should just stop guessing, I'm
probably embarrassing myself.

28:48.914 --> 28:52.458
I'm the girl
who ran into you.

28:52.558 --> 28:54.560
Unexpected.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.783
I have no idea how
to apologize for this.

28:57.883 --> 28:58.984
It just happened so fast.

28:59.084 --> 29:01.146
And then I was
standing there with Bailey

29:01.246 --> 29:03.028
and I found your address
on your Christmas card,

29:03.128 --> 29:04.269
so we went to your house,

29:04.369 --> 29:08.193
and then Bailey ran
inside, I had the keys...

29:08.293 --> 29:11.076
Okay now I'm the one
making myself look worse.

29:11.176 --> 29:12.557
You went in my house?

29:12.657 --> 29:13.638
I did.

29:13.738 --> 29:14.839
Was anyone there?

29:14.939 --> 29:15.640
No.

29:15.740 --> 29:17.242
Did you take a look around?

29:17.342 --> 29:18.082
A little.

29:18.182 --> 29:19.684
And what'd you find out?

29:19.784 --> 29:21.726
Your name.

29:21.826 --> 29:23.488
Also, you work in
public relations

29:23.588 --> 29:25.750
for Anthony Cleaver Parks!

29:26.831 --> 29:28.933
He's a very famous author.

29:29.033 --> 29:31.575
So, I guess you're
kind of a big deal.

29:31.675 --> 29:33.677
Well that's exciting.

29:35.759 --> 29:36.820
What else?

29:36.920 --> 29:39.063
You packed an overnight
bag to go somewhere.

29:39.163 --> 29:40.464
I think you
have a girlfriend.

29:40.564 --> 29:42.226
I saw a photo,
she's lovely.

29:42.326 --> 29:45.909
Also, you're not much
for Christmas decorations.

29:46.009 --> 29:47.551
No, that can't be true.

29:47.651 --> 29:50.794
I'm pretty sure
that I love Christmas.

29:50.894 --> 29:53.396
Can I help at all?

29:53.496 --> 29:55.999
Yes, yes in fact you can.

29:56.099 --> 29:57.801
My neurologist said
that items from home

29:57.901 --> 29:59.322
might be able
to jog my memory.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.724
Would you mind
going back to my house

30:00.824 --> 30:02.205
and grabbing a
few of my things?

30:02.305 --> 30:05.929
I hate to ask, but
right now you're kind of...

30:06.029 --> 30:08.851
well, you're the only
person that I know.

30:08.951 --> 30:10.413
I'd be happy to.

30:10.513 --> 30:12.895
I'll come by
tomorrow after work.

30:12.995 --> 30:14.657
What do you do?

30:14.757 --> 30:17.279
I work at a bookstore
in Northern Liberties.

30:18.441 --> 30:23.045
Actually, I've seen you walk
by a few times with Bailey.

30:24.446 --> 30:27.469
Oh, Bailey.

30:27.569 --> 30:31.353
Oh Bailey, I don't think they're
gonna let me keep you here...

30:31.453 --> 30:33.435
He can hang out with me.

30:33.535 --> 30:35.077
That's fine.

30:35.177 --> 30:37.179
Really?

30:37.819 --> 30:39.821
Thank you.

30:44.346 --> 30:46.288
Rudolph!

30:46.388 --> 30:49.831
I remember my dog,
Jane Austen, and Rudolph.

30:51.993 --> 30:53.995
And now you.

31:02.363 --> 31:04.365
[Dog whimpering]

31:08.249 --> 31:10.251
You need to go out?

31:12.132 --> 31:15.276
You wanna come
up here, don't you?

31:15.376 --> 31:17.878
You had a heck
of a day, huh?

31:17.978 --> 31:19.480
Me too.

31:19.580 --> 31:22.262
Okay, come on.

31:24.945 --> 31:26.947
Good boy.

31:31.992 --> 31:33.994
Good night, Bailey.

31:45.685 --> 31:48.748
I forgot how much I
enjoy walking a dog!

31:48.848 --> 31:51.711
It's just a great way
to clear your mind!

31:51.811 --> 31:54.393
My mind is anything
but clear right now.

31:54.493 --> 31:57.036
I have got to help
Aiden remember who he is.

31:57.136 --> 32:00.319
I can't find a single
Aiden Anderson in Philadelphia.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.760
Did you check on Facebook?

32:01.860 --> 32:04.003
Yeah, Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram...

32:04.103 --> 32:06.005
I found several
William Andersons,

32:06.105 --> 32:08.207
but none of the
photos were a match.

32:08.307 --> 32:11.009
No one's filed a missing
persons report for him.

32:11.109 --> 32:12.211
And his phone?

32:12.311 --> 32:15.414
Missing, along with his
wallet and any other ID.

32:15.514 --> 32:17.175
The nurse asked me
to go by Aiden's place

32:17.275 --> 32:19.538
to pick up a few things
to jog his memory.

32:19.638 --> 32:21.820
Do you need me to watch
Bailey while you're at work?

32:21.920 --> 32:24.222
Oh it's okay, Terrence
said I could bring him in.

32:24.322 --> 32:25.984
And on top of all
of this, Christmas Eve

32:26.084 --> 32:28.907
is in five days and
there's still so much to do.

32:29.007 --> 32:30.388
Good morning, ladies!

32:30.488 --> 32:32.490
Good morning, Luigi!

32:33.811 --> 32:35.193
My bike!

32:35.293 --> 32:37.435
Just like new, huh?

32:37.535 --> 32:38.716
Better than new!

32:38.816 --> 32:40.077
How much do I owe you?

32:40.177 --> 32:41.439
No charge.

32:41.539 --> 32:42.680
Buon Natale!

32:42.780 --> 32:43.721
Luigi, I couldn't.

32:43.821 --> 32:45.363
You do so much for me already.

32:45.463 --> 32:46.364
I cannot take your money.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.966
No, no, no.
Scoretto!

32:49.066 --> 32:51.068
That means impolite.

32:52.469 --> 32:53.811
You speak Italian?

32:53.911 --> 32:55.572
Un poco.

32:55.672 --> 32:58.655
I dabble in the
romance languages.

32:58.755 --> 33:00.097
I'm a dabbler.

33:00.197 --> 33:03.460
Well, I'm gonna walk this
home and then Mrs. Henley,

33:03.560 --> 33:05.182
if you don't mind--

33:05.282 --> 33:08.024
Oh of course!

33:08.124 --> 33:10.147
Luigi, excuse us.

33:10.247 --> 33:12.028
We are women on a mission.

33:12.128 --> 33:14.070
Piacere!

33:14.170 --> 33:14.831
Thanks again.

33:14.931 --> 33:16.933
Ciao.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.483
Well good morning,
Mystery Man!

33:27.583 --> 33:30.606
Good morning,
Nurse Nancy.

33:30.706 --> 33:32.708
Well, look at this!

33:35.151 --> 33:37.153
You're quite good.

33:39.635 --> 33:42.938
I keep seeing this house.

33:43.038 --> 33:44.700
I don't know if
it means anything.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.742
Well, if drawing
helps you remember,

33:46.842 --> 33:47.863
then go with it.

33:47.963 --> 33:49.965
Thank you.

34:14.429 --> 34:17.130
He didn't put up
a tree anywhere?

34:17.231 --> 34:19.694
Not everyone does.

34:19.793 --> 34:23.177
Sometimes I do not understand
your generation at all.

34:23.277 --> 34:24.217
Did you find anything?

34:24.318 --> 34:25.820
Yes!

34:25.920 --> 34:27.621
A gift certificate
for two tickets

34:27.721 --> 34:31.264
to The Nutcracker at
the Pennsylvania Ballet!

34:31.364 --> 34:32.906
Did you find
anything helpful?

34:33.005 --> 34:34.228
Darcy!

34:34.328 --> 34:36.270
This is the most
important thing in this house!

34:36.370 --> 34:40.072
This is the, the
gift of culture!

34:40.172 --> 34:41.355
Okay well,
you never know.

34:41.455 --> 34:42.676
We'll bring it.

34:42.775 --> 34:44.838
I'm putting stuff
in this overnight bag.

34:44.938 --> 34:46.159
Oh!

34:46.259 --> 34:49.262
And ho ho ho,
what do we have here?

34:50.904 --> 34:52.165
He packed it in the bag.

34:52.264 --> 34:54.688
Finally, some proof that
he doesn't hate Christmas.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.870
I was truthfully
getting worried.

34:58.231 --> 34:59.412
Wonder what's in it?

34:59.512 --> 35:00.533
I don't know.

35:00.633 --> 35:03.976
I'll take it with
me and we'll find out.

35:04.076 --> 35:07.580
Well, the box and lid
were wrapped separately.

35:07.680 --> 35:10.242
That means special care.

35:11.804 --> 35:13.666
I know what you're thinking.

35:13.766 --> 35:15.147
Stop.

35:15.247 --> 35:16.789
Drop that box, lady.

35:16.889 --> 35:18.230
I shouldn't drop it.

35:18.330 --> 35:20.032
What if it's fragile?

35:20.132 --> 35:23.996
Slowly put down
that box, Mrs. Henley.

35:24.096 --> 35:26.598
If Aiden wants to open
the Christmas present,

35:26.698 --> 35:28.240
that's his business.

35:28.340 --> 35:29.641
Okay, fine.

35:29.741 --> 35:31.403
Oops!

35:31.503 --> 35:33.165
Mrs. Henley, you
did that on purpose!

35:33.265 --> 35:35.807
You can't prove that.

35:35.907 --> 35:37.449
Well, you've gone this far.

35:37.549 --> 35:39.591
I'm already an accessory.

35:40.832 --> 35:44.676
I love this new sense
of adventure in you.

35:56.287 --> 35:59.911
He was going to propose
to his girlfriend.

36:00.011 --> 36:03.814
Oh this story is
getting so interesting.

36:12.142 --> 36:13.243
A vegetable?

36:13.343 --> 36:15.345
Carrot.

36:16.707 --> 36:17.888
A mode of transportation?

36:17.988 --> 36:19.169
It's an airplane.

36:19.269 --> 36:21.271
Good.

36:21.832 --> 36:24.354
An item used in sports?

36:26.436 --> 36:28.578
Football,
it's a football!

36:28.678 --> 36:30.220
This is infuriating.

36:30.320 --> 36:32.302
You're doing
very well, Aiden.

36:32.402 --> 36:35.465
Your MRI shows
significant improvement,

36:35.565 --> 36:38.908
but I still wanna keep you
at least one more night.

36:39.008 --> 36:41.991
Now as the edema subsides,
your recall will improve.

36:42.091 --> 36:43.633
It's usually long
term memory at first

36:43.733 --> 36:46.916
and then more
recent events.

36:47.016 --> 36:50.239
Are you spending Christmas
with your family, Dr. Holbrook?

36:50.339 --> 36:52.341
I am.

36:53.782 --> 36:55.164
Everyone wants to
spend the holidays

36:55.264 --> 36:57.967
with the
people they love.

36:58.067 --> 37:01.090
I don't even know
who those people are.

37:01.190 --> 37:03.192
But you'll get there.

37:12.881 --> 37:14.923
So how're you feeling?

37:16.324 --> 37:19.187
Well, Nurse Nancy here
won't let me go outside.

37:19.287 --> 37:21.910
You're recovering from
a head injury, Aiden.

37:22.010 --> 37:23.311
We can't have you
wandering around.

37:23.411 --> 37:26.234
I'm going stir crazy in here.

37:26.334 --> 37:27.635
What if I went with him?

37:27.735 --> 37:30.098
We could take Bailey
out for a quick walk.

37:31.979 --> 37:34.001
There's a Christmas party
in the visitor's lounge.

37:34.101 --> 37:36.884
Take Bailey out, and
report back to me there.

37:36.984 --> 37:38.986
Thank you,
Nurse Nancy.

37:41.949 --> 37:44.351
So, anything look familiar?

37:49.236 --> 37:51.278
Yeah actually,
this sweatshirt.

37:54.161 --> 37:57.424
I think I might've gone to
The Ohio State University.

37:57.524 --> 37:59.306
Anything else?

37:59.406 --> 38:01.068
The award?
The book?

38:01.168 --> 38:03.230
The tickets to
The Nutcracker?

38:03.330 --> 38:05.952
No, no...

38:06.052 --> 38:07.073
nope.

38:07.173 --> 38:09.476
Okay...

38:09.576 --> 38:11.578
how about this?

38:17.063 --> 38:19.065
No.

38:19.705 --> 38:21.728
Nothing.

38:21.828 --> 38:24.730
I'm sorry, should
I know who she is?

38:24.830 --> 38:26.832
Maybe.

38:28.034 --> 38:30.116
The thing is...

38:51.977 --> 38:53.979
Oh.

38:55.620 --> 38:58.343
Do you remember?

39:00.745 --> 39:02.747
I think...

39:04.228 --> 39:06.991
I think I'll take
that walk now.

39:29.173 --> 39:31.315
Wow, they really
go all out, huh?

39:31.415 --> 39:34.738
My landlady would
love this place.

39:36.660 --> 39:37.361
Here you go.

39:37.461 --> 39:38.442
Oh thanks.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.544
Thank you!

39:44.227 --> 39:46.329
I remembered.

39:46.429 --> 39:48.491
The ring, I mean.

39:48.591 --> 39:50.593
I figured.

39:51.274 --> 39:52.976
That's good, Aiden.

39:53.076 --> 39:56.039
It was my mom's.

39:57.320 --> 40:03.506
She lost it when I was a kid and
she was so distraught over it,

40:03.606 --> 40:05.468
and my Dad said,

40:05.568 --> 40:10.412
“It's not the ring that
matters, it's the promise.”

40:12.534 --> 40:14.236
Patricia.

40:14.336 --> 40:17.519
My mom's name
was Patricia.

40:17.619 --> 40:19.621
Was?

40:21.783 --> 40:23.605
Yeah, she...

40:23.705 --> 40:25.327
she passed away.

40:25.427 --> 40:28.690
That memory, that's what
caught me so off guard.

40:28.790 --> 40:33.114
I was in college and I
remember my dad calling.

40:35.477 --> 40:37.499
I can see his face, I--

40:37.599 --> 40:39.941
I just don't
remember his name.

40:40.041 --> 40:41.823
I'm sorry.

40:41.923 --> 40:44.145
We don't need
to talk about it.

40:44.245 --> 40:45.987
No no, it's okay,
it's like you said.

40:46.087 --> 40:47.668
I remember and that's good.

40:47.768 --> 40:51.012
I'm grateful for any
memory, even the sad ones.

40:52.813 --> 40:55.556
How long have I had this?

40:55.656 --> 40:58.559
I can't believe that
I'm holding this right now.

40:58.659 --> 41:00.881
And somewhere out there,
there's a girl

41:00.981 --> 41:04.525
who I loved enough to
offer my mom's ring.

41:04.625 --> 41:08.248
And I have no
memory of her at all.

41:08.348 --> 41:11.471
What happens if I never
remember her, Darcy?

41:14.514 --> 41:19.039
This woman that, apparently
I'm planning to marry?

41:20.840 --> 41:23.903
I really believe that
when you see her in person,

41:24.003 --> 41:26.706
and you hear her voice,

41:26.806 --> 41:28.388
there'll be a spark,

41:28.488 --> 41:31.070
and the memories will
start to come back.

41:31.170 --> 41:32.912
And if they don't?

41:33.012 --> 41:36.516
Well, then you'll
make new ones.

41:36.616 --> 41:38.978
Maybe we should get
back to the hospital.

41:52.231 --> 41:53.292
Hello Darcy.

41:53.392 --> 41:54.573
Mr. Farley!

41:54.673 --> 41:55.894
How's your grandson?

41:55.994 --> 41:58.137
That's him over
there with my wife.

41:58.237 --> 41:59.898
He's doing really well.

41:59.998 --> 42:01.260
They say he'll be
out by Saturday.

42:01.360 --> 42:02.301
That's wonderful news.

42:02.401 --> 42:03.462
I'll say.

42:03.562 --> 42:04.983
He's never missed a
Christmas at Chaucer's.

42:05.083 --> 42:06.705
I look forward to
seeing him there.

42:06.805 --> 42:07.986
How's Bailey's owner?

42:08.086 --> 42:10.308
He got to take Bailey
for a walk outside today,

42:10.408 --> 42:12.631
which cheered him up.

42:12.731 --> 42:16.394
All my grandson wants is to do
is go out and build a snowman.

42:16.494 --> 42:17.796
Gotta be rough on a kid,

42:17.896 --> 42:20.298
being stuck in the
hospital at Christmas.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.602
And then another
dot of glue.

42:24.702 --> 42:26.844
This was a great idea.

42:26.944 --> 42:30.368
Well, if we can't bring
the kids to the outdoors,

42:30.468 --> 42:33.230
maybe we can bring
the outdoors to them.

42:36.353 --> 42:38.355
Very nice!

42:39.196 --> 42:40.658
Now you try.

42:40.758 --> 42:41.699
Okay.

42:41.799 --> 42:43.500
And how many of
these am I making again?

42:43.600 --> 42:44.661
I don't know, Aiden.

42:44.761 --> 42:46.383
How happy do you want
to make these kids?

42:46.483 --> 42:48.265
Okay, good point.

42:48.365 --> 42:50.787
I did want something
to occupy my time.

42:50.887 --> 42:52.990
I just wish I knew
a way to repay you,

42:53.090 --> 42:55.091
for everything
you've done.

42:58.335 --> 42:59.876
There is one thing.

42:59.976 --> 43:03.079
Do you have any need for
those tickets to The Nutcracker?

43:03.179 --> 43:06.122
I think I can safely say no.

43:06.222 --> 43:07.444
My landlady,
Mrs. Henley,

43:07.544 --> 43:10.326
has been so great
helping with Bailey.

43:10.426 --> 43:12.608
Yes, please
make that happen.

43:12.708 --> 43:16.432
Gotta spread that Christmas
cheer as often as we can.

43:26.642 --> 43:29.585
Oh, and I tried calling
Ohio State's alumnae office.

43:29.685 --> 43:33.108
Closed for the
holidays, of course.

43:33.208 --> 43:35.070
It's like every road
I try just seems

43:35.170 --> 43:36.832
to lead to
another dead end.

43:36.932 --> 43:38.153
Oh, Darcy.

43:38.253 --> 43:41.196
You've been reading mystery
novels your entire life.

43:41.296 --> 43:43.518
You just need to
look for the clues.

43:43.618 --> 43:46.441
I'm afraid this
trail is stone cold.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.083
But I did teach him origami!

43:48.183 --> 43:49.084
Yay!

43:49.184 --> 43:51.166
Little victories count.

43:51.266 --> 43:53.568
Oh, and if you'd like to use
those tickets to The Nutcracker,

43:53.668 --> 43:55.410
Aiden says you're
welcome to them.

43:55.510 --> 43:58.613
As a thank you
for watching Bailey.

43:58.713 --> 44:00.335
Really?

44:00.435 --> 44:02.096
Oh Darcy!

44:02.196 --> 44:04.499
Oh, that's so wonderful!

44:04.599 --> 44:06.180
I told him
you'd be excited.

44:06.280 --> 44:07.582
No, you don't understand.

44:07.682 --> 44:10.304
I was a featured
dancer in The Nutcracker,

44:10.404 --> 44:12.226
in the New York
City Theatre, what?

44:12.326 --> 44:14.108
30 years ago?

44:14.208 --> 44:16.750
Oh my goodness.

44:16.850 --> 44:19.473
That's the New
York City Theatre.

44:19.573 --> 44:21.835
They call it something
else now, I forget what.

44:21.935 --> 44:24.798
And that girl is a
professional dancer.

44:24.898 --> 44:26.600
How can you tell?

44:26.700 --> 44:29.963
Her build, her posture.

44:30.063 --> 44:32.366
And that pin she's wearing?

44:32.466 --> 44:35.769
That's the Grand
Ballet Company in New York.

44:35.869 --> 44:36.930
Oh my gosh.

44:37.030 --> 44:39.392
We found her!

44:48.801 --> 44:49.983
Morning, Katherine!

44:50.083 --> 44:51.064
Morning!

44:51.164 --> 44:52.225
Aren't you closing tonight?

44:52.325 --> 44:54.227
I just came in to drop
off some decorations

44:54.327 --> 44:55.348
for the display window.

44:55.448 --> 44:56.669
And to give updates.

44:56.769 --> 44:58.311
Amnesia guy's
would-be fiance

44:58.411 --> 45:00.152
might be a ballerina
in New York.

45:00.252 --> 45:01.153
Oh, that's thrilling.

45:01.253 --> 45:02.234
She got a name?

45:02.334 --> 45:04.396
Not yet, but here's
what I'm thinking.

45:04.496 --> 45:07.359
He had the engagement ring,
he'd packed a overnight bag.

45:07.459 --> 45:09.361
Maybe Aiden was on
his way to New York

45:09.461 --> 45:10.803
to propose to her there.

45:10.903 --> 45:11.924
New York at Christmas.

45:12.024 --> 45:13.285
Attractive, iconic.

45:13.385 --> 45:14.606
I'd say yes to that.

45:14.706 --> 45:17.089
But here's what I
don't understand.

45:17.189 --> 45:19.451
I left a note on the kitchen
counter at Aiden's place,

45:19.551 --> 45:21.293
with my cell number on it.

45:21.393 --> 45:23.655
The ballerina hasn't
heard from him in days,

45:23.755 --> 45:25.577
but she doesn't come
to town to check in?

45:25.677 --> 45:27.259
You're right, that's odd.

45:27.359 --> 45:29.140
Maybe they got in a
fight and the proposal

45:29.240 --> 45:31.583
was like his big save, trying
to rescue the relationship.

45:31.683 --> 45:33.304
Guys do dumb stuff
like that all the time!

45:33.404 --> 45:34.666
She's right.

45:34.766 --> 45:36.027
So, you gonna tell him?

45:36.127 --> 45:38.389
I don't know her name,
he can't call her.

45:38.489 --> 45:41.432
I just worry that it'll
cause Aiden more stress.

45:41.532 --> 45:45.356
Nurse Nancy says that anxiety
can worsen the memory block.

45:45.456 --> 45:46.597
You could go to Manhattan.

45:46.697 --> 45:48.199
Stop by the ballet, find her.

45:48.299 --> 45:49.880
Either of you feel
like a trip to New York?

45:49.980 --> 45:52.403
I would love to,
but I have to study.

45:52.503 --> 45:54.565
I'm just not really
a great traveler.

45:54.665 --> 45:56.767
It would be so nice to
not have to do it by myself.

45:56.867 --> 45:57.848
Oh!

45:57.948 --> 45:59.009
Check out the new
ad at Christmas Eve

45:59.109 --> 46:00.130
for Books Books Books.

46:00.230 --> 46:01.492
They're gonna have
a Santa bounce house.

46:01.592 --> 46:03.213
How are we supposed
to compete with that?

46:03.313 --> 46:05.976
Okay, here's what we do.

46:06.076 --> 46:08.899
We send out an email blast
today to our mailing list.

46:08.999 --> 46:11.141
Luigi's Restaurant
is going to cater

46:11.241 --> 46:13.263
Christmas Eve
at Chaucer's.

46:13.363 --> 46:16.066
And also put in there we'll
have Christmas carolers

46:16.166 --> 46:17.867
and a surprise guest, too.

46:17.967 --> 46:19.429
That's good,
who's the guest?

46:19.529 --> 46:20.710
I have no idea.

46:20.810 --> 46:22.432
I'll figure it out when
I come in this afternoon.

46:22.532 --> 46:25.835
Right now it's a
surprise to all of us.

46:25.935 --> 46:27.957
I gotta go, they're
expecting me at the hospital.

46:28.057 --> 46:29.399
So early?

46:29.499 --> 46:31.961
Well, we're
up to something.

46:32.061 --> 46:34.063
Okay, bye!

46:39.949 --> 46:41.170
Good morning!

46:41.270 --> 46:42.291
Well, good morning!

46:42.391 --> 46:43.732
I brought you a
cranberry egg nog muffin.

46:43.832 --> 46:45.494
It's all the
flavors of Christmas,

46:45.594 --> 46:47.016
in muffin form.

46:47.116 --> 46:49.098
Sounds delicious.

46:49.198 --> 46:52.101
I ran into Bob and
Anita Farley in the hall.

46:52.201 --> 46:54.062
Seems like you've gotten
pretty popular around here.

46:54.162 --> 46:56.625
That makes sense, I do
work in public relations.

46:56.725 --> 46:57.466
You remembered?

46:57.566 --> 46:58.547
No, I'm just
going with it.

46:58.647 --> 46:59.908
Fake it till you make it.

47:00.008 --> 47:01.950
Exactly.

47:02.050 --> 47:02.951
Oh, wow.

47:03.051 --> 47:04.432
I know, right?

47:04.532 --> 47:06.194
This is the first non-hospital
food that I've had in days.

47:06.294 --> 47:09.357
Thank you so much.

47:09.457 --> 47:11.399
Did you finish all of
your Christmas shopping?

47:11.499 --> 47:12.720
Everyone gets books.

47:12.820 --> 47:14.242
I work in a bookstore.

47:14.342 --> 47:17.365
Then again, they all got books
before I worked in a bookstore.

47:17.465 --> 47:20.048
I believe everyone should
declare a favorite author.

47:20.148 --> 47:23.251
It says a heck of a lot more
than your astrological sign.

47:23.351 --> 47:24.812
Fair point.

47:24.912 --> 47:26.414
Who's your favorite author?

47:26.514 --> 47:28.055
I don't know.

47:28.155 --> 47:31.218
But I think I usually do.

47:31.318 --> 47:33.420
So did you get
your mom Jane Austen?

47:33.520 --> 47:34.902
Why would you ask?

47:35.002 --> 47:36.263
She named you
after Mr. Darcy.

47:36.363 --> 47:39.226
I just assumed that Austen
was one of her favorites.

47:39.326 --> 47:43.710
My parents passed away
a couple of years ago.

47:43.810 --> 47:46.353
Car accident, so...

47:46.453 --> 47:49.076
Darcy, I'm so sorry,
I didn't realize--

47:49.176 --> 47:51.118
It's okay.

47:51.218 --> 47:53.400
It was hard,
it still is,

47:53.500 --> 47:56.563
but I've assembled
quite the surrogate family.

47:56.663 --> 48:00.006
And Chaucer's Bookstore
is our homestead.

48:00.106 --> 48:02.268
I look forward
to seeing that.

48:04.671 --> 48:05.892
Oh, I wanted to show you.

48:05.992 --> 48:07.974
I did some sketches.

48:08.074 --> 48:09.575
I think my childhood
memories are flooding back,

48:09.675 --> 48:12.138
because I keep on getting
these really vivid images

48:12.238 --> 48:14.620
of school as if it
happened last week.

48:14.720 --> 48:18.364
Meanwhile, I have no idea
what happened last week.

48:27.813 --> 48:29.815
Nice!

48:32.818 --> 48:35.200
I still don't understand
how you did all this.

48:35.300 --> 48:38.884
I made a few calls, but
most of this was Aiden.

48:38.984 --> 48:42.267
Turns out he's very good
at bringing people together.

48:45.790 --> 48:48.053
He really is a
good guy, isn't he?

48:48.153 --> 48:50.154
Appears to be.

48:53.037 --> 48:55.300
Any luck finding the
girl in the photograph?

48:55.400 --> 48:57.782
I did find a good lead.

48:57.882 --> 48:59.864
I hope you find her.

48:59.964 --> 49:02.947
He deserves to have
someone around who loves him.

49:03.047 --> 49:05.329
Yeah, he really does.

49:08.572 --> 49:09.794
Mr. Anderson!

49:09.894 --> 49:11.555
Please watch your head.

49:11.655 --> 49:13.657
I will!

49:20.264 --> 49:22.466
One ticket to
Manhattan, please.

49:25.028 --> 49:26.890
You don't mind spending
the day with Mrs. Henley,

49:26.990 --> 49:28.992
do you Bailey?

49:43.046 --> 49:46.989
Dr. Holbrook says your scans
from this morning look good.

49:47.089 --> 49:49.272
So she's given permission
to go outside again today

49:49.372 --> 49:50.433
for exercise.

49:50.533 --> 49:52.114
Oh, that's awesome news!

49:52.214 --> 49:54.877
Provided that you have
medical supervision.

49:54.977 --> 49:58.160
So, it looks like we both get
to take a little break today.

49:58.260 --> 49:59.762
Anywhere that
you'd like to go?

49:59.862 --> 50:03.365
Maybe a walk
along the waterfront?

50:03.465 --> 50:05.728
Actually, there
is this bookstore

50:05.828 --> 50:08.230
I've been wanting
to check out.

50:30.772 --> 50:32.313
That's a very
interesting story.

50:32.413 --> 50:35.837
But I can't give out personal
information about our dancers.

50:35.937 --> 50:37.238
Right.

50:37.338 --> 50:39.560
Except, maybe
could you please?

50:39.660 --> 50:40.601
I'm sorry.

50:40.701 --> 50:43.164
There's really
nothing here I can do.

50:43.264 --> 50:45.086
No.

50:45.186 --> 50:47.328
No, that's
not good enough.

50:47.428 --> 50:50.571
I'm sorry but I took
the train all the way here

50:50.671 --> 50:51.532
from Philadelphia--

50:51.632 --> 50:52.493
I don't see what that--

50:52.593 --> 50:53.934
Listen!

50:54.034 --> 50:57.137
There is a man who made a
room full of paper snowflakes

50:57.237 --> 51:00.020
just to make kids
in the hospital smile.

51:00.120 --> 51:01.541
And he doesn't
know who he is.

51:01.641 --> 51:02.983
And this girl?

51:03.083 --> 51:06.506
This girl in the photograph,
I think maybe she loves him.

51:06.606 --> 51:11.671
Please, help me make
some Christmas magic here.

51:11.771 --> 51:13.773
Let me see.

51:15.375 --> 51:17.637
That's Melanie Porter.

51:17.737 --> 51:18.958
She's away on tour.

51:19.058 --> 51:20.320
You know her?

51:20.420 --> 51:22.602
Could I please have her number?

51:22.702 --> 51:25.985
Who am I to get in the way
of a little Christmas magic?

51:32.912 --> 51:34.914
Thank you.

51:37.196 --> 51:39.058
Does anything look familiar?

51:39.158 --> 51:40.579
Yeah!

51:40.679 --> 51:44.103
Actually this
looks really familiar.

51:44.203 --> 51:46.185
Let's go in.

51:46.285 --> 51:48.106
Thank you so much.

51:48.206 --> 51:50.749
We got the last four Christmas
carolers in Philadelphia.

51:50.849 --> 51:51.630
Hey!

51:51.730 --> 51:52.671
Take that,
Books Books Books!

51:52.771 --> 51:53.952
Darcy does it again.

51:54.052 --> 51:55.634
That girl can
make a plan happen.

51:55.734 --> 51:57.275
So why isn't she
applying for general manager?

51:57.375 --> 51:58.677
It's actually infuriating.

51:58.777 --> 52:00.198
Darcy's literally the
most capable person I know,

52:00.298 --> 52:01.960
and somehow,
she can't see it.

52:02.060 --> 52:03.641
She's single-handedly
planning Christmas Eve,

52:03.741 --> 52:05.243
all while taking
care of amnesia guy.

52:05.343 --> 52:06.684
And his dog.

52:06.784 --> 52:08.686
Bailey's a
pretty great dog.

52:08.786 --> 52:11.309
Can we help you
find anything?

52:13.030 --> 52:15.693
I'm guessing that
Darcy isn't here?

52:15.793 --> 52:17.255
What makes you say that?

52:17.355 --> 52:19.897
Well you two were just
talking about her really loudly.

52:19.997 --> 52:21.899
I'm sorry, do I know you?

52:21.999 --> 52:24.261
That's a trickier
question than you realize.

52:24.361 --> 52:26.063
From the front
window, of course!

52:26.163 --> 52:28.345
You're amnesia guy!

52:28.445 --> 52:30.107
Well that is
my formal title,

52:30.207 --> 52:32.309
but you can
call me Aiden.

52:32.409 --> 52:34.151
Right, Aiden.

52:34.251 --> 52:35.552
Darcy's off today.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.555
You said you saw him in the
front window before today?

52:38.655 --> 52:40.357
Yeah, on Sunday I think.

52:40.457 --> 52:42.799
You had Bailey with you.

52:42.899 --> 52:45.802
Aiden, maybe you know
somebody in the neighborhood.

52:45.902 --> 52:47.904
Yeah.

52:48.264 --> 52:50.206
You've reached the
voicemail of Melanie Porter.

52:50.306 --> 52:52.989
Leave a message
and I'll call ya back.

52:54.510 --> 52:57.974
Hi, Melanie,
this is Darcy Archer.

52:58.074 --> 52:59.455
We don't know each other.

52:59.555 --> 53:01.778
I'm a friend of
Aiden Anderson,

53:01.878 --> 53:05.781
maybe you know him
as William Anderson?

53:05.881 --> 53:09.065
There was a small
accident, he's okay,

53:09.165 --> 53:11.547
but he got hit on the head,

53:11.647 --> 53:14.049
and he has a tiny
case of amnesia.

53:18.133 --> 53:20.396
I called the police
again this morning.

53:20.496 --> 53:23.358
They still have no calls
regarding a missing person.

53:23.458 --> 53:25.561
I guess my family
doesn't know I'm missing.

53:25.661 --> 53:27.963
Does anything
else look familiar?

53:28.063 --> 53:30.285
Not really.

53:30.385 --> 53:31.686
We should get
back to the hospital.

53:31.786 --> 53:32.968
My car's right over there.

53:33.068 --> 53:35.070
Wait a second!

53:38.833 --> 53:40.175
Oh, that explains it.

53:40.275 --> 53:41.496
You came by on Sunday.

53:41.596 --> 53:43.258
I don't work on Sundays.

53:43.358 --> 53:45.660
Says Ralph helped
you, and you paid cash.

53:45.760 --> 53:47.742
Okay well, can
I speak to Ralph?

53:47.842 --> 53:49.464
He's on a plane to Tucson.

53:49.564 --> 53:51.626
Oh.

53:51.726 --> 53:54.268
Ma'am, my name
is Nancy Thompson,

53:54.368 --> 53:56.991
I'm a nurse at
Einstein Hospital.

53:57.091 --> 53:58.993
This gentleman is
a patient of ours.

53:59.093 --> 54:03.357
Any information that you could
offer would be much appreciated.

54:03.457 --> 54:05.459
Let's have a look.

54:07.861 --> 54:10.364
Then apparently I found
a diamond certificate

54:10.464 --> 54:11.925
in some of my mom's old stuff,

54:12.025 --> 54:13.527
and even though the
setting was an antique,

54:13.627 --> 54:16.730
my Dad surprised her with
a diamond upgrade in 1989.

54:16.830 --> 54:19.172
I'm sure that's significant,
I'm just not seeing it.

54:19.272 --> 54:21.735
There was a serial number
engraved in the side.

54:21.835 --> 54:25.058
So I entered the serial
number, and lo and behold,

54:25.158 --> 54:28.221
it pops up in an antique store
right here in Philadelphia.

54:28.321 --> 54:29.903
And then you
waited three weeks

54:30.003 --> 54:31.704
to go down the
street and get it?

54:31.804 --> 54:32.986
Yeah, that is
a little weird.

54:33.086 --> 54:34.747
I must've been
out of town.

54:34.847 --> 54:36.069
Of course,
that's wonderful.

54:36.169 --> 54:38.471
It still feels like there's
something missing there,

54:38.571 --> 54:39.632
doesn't it?

54:39.732 --> 54:40.633
How so?

54:40.733 --> 54:42.475
Well, you're from Ohio.

54:42.575 --> 54:44.797
You went to college
at Ohio State.

54:44.897 --> 54:47.039
You moved to Philadelphia
at some point after graduation

54:47.139 --> 54:50.002
and then years later, your
mother's engagement ring,

54:50.102 --> 54:52.044
which has been
missing for decades,

54:52.144 --> 54:55.287
shows up at a shop located
six blocks from your house?

54:55.387 --> 54:57.169
I'm not saying it
couldn't happen,

54:57.269 --> 55:00.012
but you've gotta admit
it's a heck of a coincidence.

55:00.112 --> 55:01.453
No, it makes no sense.

55:01.553 --> 55:03.015
You're right.

55:03.115 --> 55:05.197
More missing pieces.

55:06.558 --> 55:08.740
Well, maybe one less.

55:08.840 --> 55:11.263
Does the name Melanie
Porter mean anything to you?

55:11.363 --> 55:12.344
No.

55:12.444 --> 55:13.545
Melanie Porter.

55:13.645 --> 55:14.386
No.

55:14.486 --> 55:15.427
Melanie Porter?

55:15.527 --> 55:17.429
We can do this all
day, if you want.

55:17.529 --> 55:19.691
She's the girl in
the photo, Aiden.

55:25.576 --> 55:27.398
Melanie Porter...

55:27.498 --> 55:29.320
She's a professional
ballerina.

55:29.420 --> 55:30.882
I went to Manhattan
this morning

55:30.982 --> 55:32.203
and met this really
nice receptionist

55:32.303 --> 55:33.925
at the Grand
Ballet Company.

55:34.025 --> 55:35.086
Melanie dances there--

55:35.186 --> 55:38.209
I'm sorry, you went to
Manhattan this morning?

55:38.309 --> 55:41.252
Just a quick little
trip on the train.

55:41.352 --> 55:43.774
I knew you were nervous
about meeting her,

55:43.874 --> 55:45.896
I thought if met
her first in person,

55:45.996 --> 55:48.699
explained the situation...

55:48.799 --> 55:51.862
I just wanted to bring
you guys back together.

55:51.962 --> 55:54.424
Darcy, you amaze me.

55:54.524 --> 55:56.727
I wish I had your tenacity.

55:57.928 --> 55:59.930
What?

56:00.850 --> 56:03.153
That's not how most
people would describe me.

56:03.253 --> 56:05.295
Well, they should.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.238
So did you talk to her?

56:08.338 --> 56:10.160
I left a voicemail.

56:10.260 --> 56:12.162
A voicemail?

56:12.262 --> 56:14.604
So then I guess
now we just wait.

56:14.704 --> 56:17.407
Are you upset that I didn't
ask your permission first?

56:17.507 --> 56:18.928
Did I overstep?

56:19.028 --> 56:23.452
No, I think we flew right past
overstepping on the first day.

56:23.552 --> 56:25.294
I really appreciate
what you did.

56:25.394 --> 56:27.456
I just...

56:27.556 --> 56:30.839
I just wish that
I remembered her.

56:32.201 --> 56:33.502
You will.

56:33.602 --> 56:36.845
I also wish that I
had your confidence.

56:38.006 --> 56:40.068
When you're standing
in front of the woman

56:40.168 --> 56:43.852
you're meant to be with,
I believe you'll know.

56:46.214 --> 56:49.638
May I ask you a
personal question?

56:49.738 --> 56:51.359
Seems only fair.

56:51.459 --> 56:53.842
Why haven't you pitched
yourself for the position

56:53.942 --> 56:56.685
of general manager
over at Chaucer's?

56:56.785 --> 56:58.046
Uh, what?

56:58.146 --> 57:00.208
I may have overstepped
a little bit today, too.

57:00.308 --> 57:03.411
Nurse Nancy took
me by your shop

57:03.511 --> 57:06.134
and a couple of your coworkers
might have been complaining

57:06.234 --> 57:08.055
about you not
applying to run the place.

57:08.155 --> 57:09.697
I'm going to strangle them!

57:09.797 --> 57:10.858
Dr. Holbrook!

57:10.958 --> 57:11.899
Hi!

57:11.999 --> 57:15.182
Darcy Archer, this
is my neurologist.

57:15.282 --> 57:17.785
Are you ready to
get out of here, Aiden?

57:17.885 --> 57:20.027
Seriously?

57:20.127 --> 57:22.790
I told Dr. Holbrook
that I observed

57:22.890 --> 57:24.952
no areas of concern when
you were ambulatory today.

57:25.052 --> 57:27.995
And the swelling on your brain
is sufficiently under control,

57:28.095 --> 57:30.717
so I'm comfortable
signing your release.

57:30.817 --> 57:32.279
But...

57:32.379 --> 57:34.161
there's still so
much I don't remember.

57:34.261 --> 57:37.524
Which is why we'd still like to
see you for cognitive therapy,

57:37.624 --> 57:39.085
but the best
thing you can do

57:39.185 --> 57:40.967
is to surround yourself
with the familiar.

57:41.067 --> 57:43.810
Gosh well, okay.

57:43.910 --> 57:45.131
Thanks doc!

57:45.231 --> 57:47.874
Stay put and we'll
get your paperwork.

57:53.840 --> 57:56.923
So what do I do now?

57:58.084 --> 58:00.646
I guess you go home.

58:17.583 --> 58:21.126
I mean it looks familiar.

58:21.226 --> 58:23.568
But it doesn't
really feel like home.

58:23.668 --> 58:24.890
Give it a minute.

58:24.990 --> 58:27.372
Settle in a bit.

58:27.472 --> 58:29.534
It just doesn't feel like me.

58:29.634 --> 58:31.956
How so?

58:33.598 --> 58:35.660
Well, take this
sculpture for instance.

58:35.760 --> 58:37.262
What about it?

58:37.362 --> 58:39.504
I really hate that sculpture.

58:39.604 --> 58:41.726
Well maybe it was a gift.

58:43.608 --> 58:46.250
No tree?

58:48.372 --> 58:51.756
Not even a single decoration?

58:51.856 --> 58:53.317
I love Christmas.

58:53.417 --> 58:56.520
I know I love Christmas.

58:56.620 --> 58:59.924
Would it feel more like home
if we decked the halls a bit?

59:00.024 --> 59:01.925
Because I can
make that happen.

59:02.025 --> 59:03.567
I don't want you going
out and buying anything.

59:03.667 --> 59:05.489
I wasn't planning on it.

59:05.589 --> 59:07.951
Just lemme make a phone call.

59:10.313 --> 59:12.496
Hey Bailey!

59:12.596 --> 59:14.498
Don't worry,
there's more in the car!

59:14.598 --> 59:16.219
Let me help
you with that.

59:16.319 --> 59:17.460
Did you pack
all that yourself?

59:17.560 --> 59:18.822
Oh, goodness no.

59:18.922 --> 59:20.303
I recruited Luigi to assist.

59:20.403 --> 59:21.544
You must be Aiden.

59:21.644 --> 59:23.026
Yes, thank you.

59:23.126 --> 59:25.628
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Henley.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.150
Darcy, you're right.

59:27.250 --> 59:28.591
He is handsome.

59:28.691 --> 59:30.633
She said I was handsome?

59:30.733 --> 59:33.996
It's, you know,
just a descriptive word.

59:34.096 --> 59:36.178
Let's unpack some
Christmas, shall we?

59:38.501 --> 59:40.703
And I'll get the
rest out of the car.

59:44.306 --> 59:46.609
My friend Josh is covering
my shift at the store today

59:46.709 --> 59:48.410
and now my phone is dead.

59:48.510 --> 59:50.412
It's been a busy day.

59:50.512 --> 59:52.975
I feel bad making
you miss all this work.

59:53.075 --> 59:54.737
I'm the one who usually
covers for everyone,

59:54.837 --> 59:58.580
I'm just calling
in a few favors.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:01.823
I did promise to find
a surprise special guest

01:00:01.923 --> 01:00:04.066
for our Christmas Eve event.

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:05.747
I'm still working
on that one.

01:00:05.847 --> 01:00:07.829
Hey, why don't we
call one of my clients?

01:00:07.929 --> 01:00:10.111
Do you remember the
password for your computer?

01:00:10.211 --> 01:00:13.274
You know, amnesia really
is the unexpected wrench

01:00:13.374 --> 01:00:15.557
in the works of a
paperless office.

01:00:15.657 --> 01:00:17.198
I don't like that word.

01:00:17.298 --> 01:00:18.519
Paperless.

01:00:18.619 --> 01:00:21.082
It's not a world
I wanna live in.

01:00:21.182 --> 01:00:24.045
So you never
answered my question.

01:00:24.145 --> 01:00:28.369
Why haven't you
applied to run the store?

01:00:28.469 --> 01:00:30.171
Honestly?

01:00:30.271 --> 01:00:34.175
I'm running out of reasons.

01:00:34.275 --> 01:00:37.778
I guess I hesitate because
I'm not the type of person

01:00:37.878 --> 01:00:39.540
who looks around
a room and thinks,

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.262
“Clearly I'm meant to be
the person in charge here.”

01:00:42.362 --> 01:00:46.026
Okay, but you are
the type of person

01:00:46.126 --> 01:00:48.148
who decides that
something needs to happen

01:00:48.248 --> 01:00:50.711
and then makes
sure that it does.

01:00:50.811 --> 01:00:52.512
Isn't that all leadership is?

01:00:52.612 --> 01:00:54.114
Maybe so.

01:00:54.214 --> 01:00:57.597
Besides, there's an experience
that I want you to have.

01:00:57.697 --> 01:00:59.439
What's that?

01:00:59.539 --> 01:01:01.161
To know how good
it feels to have

01:01:01.261 --> 01:01:04.003
Darcy Archer
fighting for you.

01:01:04.103 --> 01:01:06.105
Thank you, Aiden.

01:01:15.514 --> 01:01:18.177
That's a great
sweater, by the way.

01:01:18.277 --> 01:01:20.219
Oh, thank you.

01:01:20.319 --> 01:01:21.701
I can't take credit for it.

01:01:21.801 --> 01:01:24.503
I did find a business card for
a personal shopper upstairs.

01:01:24.603 --> 01:01:26.465
Someone buys your
clothes for you?

01:01:26.565 --> 01:01:28.567
Apparently.

01:01:29.608 --> 01:01:30.829
So what do think?

01:01:30.929 --> 01:01:32.591
How're we looking?

01:01:32.691 --> 01:01:34.693
Good, I think.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.737
One, two...

01:01:53.271 --> 01:01:55.613
Well, you think
we got enough?

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:57.295
Yes, it looks great!

01:01:57.395 --> 01:01:59.697
And who wants to make
a gingerbread house?

01:01:59.797 --> 01:02:03.421
One of my favorite
Christmas traditions.

01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:05.223
Maybe I'll...

01:02:05.323 --> 01:02:07.324
watch this!

01:02:11.689 --> 01:02:13.270
Christmas at my house,

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:16.153
there was always an
assembly line in the kitchen.

01:02:16.253 --> 01:02:20.758
My mom, she would
make so much bread

01:02:20.858 --> 01:02:23.600
that she would have to bake
the loaves in coffee cans.

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:25.842
She was pretty famous
for it, actually.

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:27.924
We would show up to
school with a loaf

01:02:28.024 --> 01:02:30.207
all wrapped up
for each teacher.

01:02:30.307 --> 01:02:32.849
Not just mine,
all of them.

01:02:32.949 --> 01:02:35.492
And they...

01:02:35.592 --> 01:02:37.594
The teachers...

01:02:39.235 --> 01:02:41.237
What?

01:02:42.438 --> 01:02:44.560
I was a teacher, Darcy.

01:02:46.522 --> 01:02:47.824
When?

01:02:47.924 --> 01:02:50.146
I don't know.

01:02:50.246 --> 01:02:51.747
But that classroom
that I was drawing,

01:02:51.847 --> 01:02:53.029
I wasn't a student in it.

01:02:53.129 --> 01:02:54.270
That was my classroom.

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.112
I can see it now,
I can see my desk,

01:02:56.212 --> 01:02:58.954
I can see my entire class.

01:02:59.054 --> 01:03:00.396
I was an art teacher.

01:03:00.496 --> 01:03:01.437
Third through fifth grade.

01:03:01.537 --> 01:03:02.998
And my first year
of teaching,

01:03:03.098 --> 01:03:06.442
my mom showed up at Christmas
with a loaf just for me.

01:03:06.542 --> 01:03:08.724
I love that.

01:03:08.824 --> 01:03:11.326
Why would I give that up?

01:03:11.426 --> 01:03:14.009
Maybe there's a
gift in all this.

01:03:14.109 --> 01:03:16.411
As you remember
who you were,

01:03:16.511 --> 01:03:19.955
you get to decide
who you want to be.

01:03:28.243 --> 01:03:30.225
I know this song.

01:03:30.325 --> 01:03:32.026
Well yes, it's been
playing everywhere.

01:03:32.126 --> 01:03:33.308
No, but this version of it.

01:03:33.408 --> 01:03:36.691
I've heard it before!
I know I have.

01:03:37.972 --> 01:03:39.714
Winter formal, in college.

01:03:39.814 --> 01:03:41.756
Will you dance with me?

01:03:41.856 --> 01:03:43.858
Oh, no--

01:03:46.380 --> 01:03:48.322
Yup, there it is.

01:03:48.422 --> 01:03:49.924
It's all coming back.

01:03:50.024 --> 01:03:52.566
And the theme was...

01:03:52.666 --> 01:03:53.767
bells.

01:03:53.867 --> 01:03:55.769
Something with bells.

01:03:55.869 --> 01:03:58.332
Jingle Bell Ball,
that's it yeah!

01:03:58.432 --> 01:04:00.434
That sounds magical.

01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:06.179
I couldn't have gotten through
this without you, Darcy.

01:04:06.279 --> 01:04:09.062
Well, you wouldn't have
gotten into this without me.

01:04:09.162 --> 01:04:11.505
You have to stop
blaming yourself.

01:04:11.605 --> 01:04:13.266
It was a moment,
an accident,

01:04:13.366 --> 01:04:15.068
and everything since
then has revealed to me

01:04:15.168 --> 01:04:16.589
who you really are.

01:04:16.689 --> 01:04:20.853
Thoughtful,
determined, funny...

01:04:22.415 --> 01:04:26.039
I do like the way you see me.

01:04:26.139 --> 01:04:28.541
I love that I get to see you.

01:04:30.823 --> 01:04:35.087
[Dog barking]

01:04:35.187 --> 01:04:37.490
Aiden will you call
your dog, please?

01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:39.592
Bailey, come!

01:04:42.995 --> 01:04:43.896
What is going on?

01:04:43.996 --> 01:04:45.337
I thought you
went back to Akron,

01:04:45.437 --> 01:04:47.419
and then I get this
crazy message from Melanie,

01:04:47.519 --> 01:04:49.221
someone told her
I have amnesia?

01:04:49.321 --> 01:04:51.623
And I've been trying to
call you all morning and...

01:04:51.723 --> 01:04:53.585
what have you
done to this house?

01:04:53.685 --> 01:04:56.268
I'm sorry, could we
back up for a second?

01:04:56.368 --> 01:04:58.270
What are you doing
in Aiden's house?

01:04:58.370 --> 01:04:59.631
This is my house.

01:04:59.731 --> 01:05:01.353
Who are you?

01:05:01.453 --> 01:05:04.556
I'm Darcy Archer,
I'm a friend of Aiden's.

01:05:04.656 --> 01:05:05.637
Who are you?

01:05:05.737 --> 01:05:06.758
I'm William Anderson.

01:05:06.858 --> 01:05:09.360
I am also a
friend of Aiden's.

01:05:09.460 --> 01:05:11.603
You're William
A. Anderson?

01:05:11.703 --> 01:05:12.764
Yes.

01:05:12.864 --> 01:05:14.245
Oh dear.

01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:15.727
You weren't
planning to use

01:05:15.827 --> 01:05:17.608
those Nutcracker
tickets, were you?

01:05:17.708 --> 01:05:19.090
Is somebody baking in here?

01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:20.852
I don't understand.

01:05:20.952 --> 01:05:24.055
If you're William
Anderson, then...

01:05:24.155 --> 01:05:26.577
I'm Aiden Harris.

01:05:26.677 --> 01:05:28.679
From Akron, Ohio.

01:05:38.528 --> 01:05:41.191
You called and said you'd
found your mother's ring

01:05:41.291 --> 01:05:44.995
at an antique store up here,
you were driving up to get it.

01:05:45.095 --> 01:05:47.477
Wanted to know if I could
recommend any hotels

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:48.999
that allow dogs.

01:05:49.099 --> 01:05:51.001
I was in California on a
book tour with a client,

01:05:51.101 --> 01:05:52.562
so I offered you my house.

01:05:52.662 --> 01:05:56.606
Which you've apparently,
decorated for Christmas.

01:05:56.706 --> 01:05:57.727
You're welcome.

01:05:57.827 --> 01:05:58.688
I'm a minimalist.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.850
Yeah, but you
don't have to be.

01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:02.612
And you guys have been
friends since college,

01:06:02.712 --> 01:06:05.214
which is why Aiden was
in your graduation photo.

01:06:05.314 --> 01:06:06.095
Yes.

01:06:06.195 --> 01:06:07.697
So Melanie is
your girlfriend?

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:08.898
Yes!

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:10.700
She tried to call after
she got Darcy's message.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.902
I really should've
charged my phone.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:16.465
Okay, so I came here from
Ohio to get my mom's ring.

01:06:16.565 --> 01:06:19.148
You had to wait until you were
on Christmas break from school.

01:06:19.248 --> 01:06:20.189
So I'm still a teacher?

01:06:20.289 --> 01:06:21.350
Yes!

01:06:21.450 --> 01:06:22.992
Oh, that's nice.

01:06:23.092 --> 01:06:25.154
I bet you you're
a great teacher.

01:06:25.254 --> 01:06:26.955
All right so...

01:06:27.055 --> 01:06:28.437
I'm sorry, Will.

01:06:28.537 --> 01:06:30.359
It's just the last week I've
been thinking that I was you.

01:06:30.459 --> 01:06:33.201
Which explains why
you're wearing my clothes.

01:06:33.301 --> 01:06:34.643
It's a really nice sweater.

01:06:34.743 --> 01:06:37.325
Aiden, I am so sorry that
you've been dealing with this.

01:06:37.425 --> 01:06:40.569
This is kind of insane,
I had no idea.

01:06:40.669 --> 01:06:43.812
I wish I'd gotten home sooner,
I was in LA with Tony Parks.

01:06:43.912 --> 01:06:45.613
Which is so amazing.

01:06:45.713 --> 01:06:47.175
She's a pretty big fan.

01:06:47.275 --> 01:06:48.736
She works over at
Chaucer's Bookstore.

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:49.857
No kidding!

01:06:49.957 --> 01:06:51.099
That's a great store.

01:06:51.199 --> 01:06:52.580
There's not many
like it anymore.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:53.901
Keep up the good fight.

01:06:54.001 --> 01:06:55.783
We certainly try.

01:06:55.883 --> 01:06:58.025
Aiden, you should
probably call your Dad.

01:06:58.125 --> 01:06:59.707
I don't know when you
were planning on being home,

01:06:59.807 --> 01:07:01.509
but he might've been
expecting you by now.

01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:03.230
The big problem
is I lost my phone,

01:07:03.330 --> 01:07:04.472
and I don't
have his number.

01:07:04.572 --> 01:07:06.434
His generation
still has landlines.

01:07:06.534 --> 01:07:08.556
That's true, we do.

01:07:08.656 --> 01:07:11.058
I'll see if he's listed.

01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:14.681
Um, Mrs. Henley?

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:18.805
Why don't we pack up
and get out of the way?

01:07:18.905 --> 01:07:19.927
No, what're you
talking about?

01:07:20.027 --> 01:07:21.248
Stay!

01:07:21.348 --> 01:07:22.729
We're finally
solving this mystery,

01:07:22.829 --> 01:07:24.651
don't you want to
see how it ends?

01:07:24.751 --> 01:07:26.813
I'm seeing it.

01:07:26.913 --> 01:07:31.898
You're being reunited
with people who love you.

01:07:31.998 --> 01:07:33.299
I'm...

01:07:33.399 --> 01:07:36.402
I'm just going to
get a little fresh air.

01:07:39.525 --> 01:07:40.386
Do I follow?

01:07:40.486 --> 01:07:42.228
You absolutely follow.

01:07:42.328 --> 01:07:44.330
Right.

01:07:56.742 --> 01:07:58.884
When did she have time
to decorate out here?

01:07:58.984 --> 01:08:01.667
She's a very
determined lady.

01:08:05.631 --> 01:08:07.332
What's wrong?

01:08:07.432 --> 01:08:09.434
Nothing, I promise.

01:08:11.676 --> 01:08:14.019
But Dr. Holbrook
said you'll do better

01:08:14.119 --> 01:08:16.862
if you're surrounded
by the familiar.

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:19.424
I need to give
you room to do that.

01:08:19.524 --> 01:08:21.666
But I'm not asking you to.

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:25.270
You're only just remembering
your life in Ohio.

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:27.712
And you wrapped up
that ring for someone,

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:31.475
and whoever it is
clearly means a lot to you.

01:08:31.576 --> 01:08:33.237
So...

01:08:33.337 --> 01:08:35.238
go back to your life.

01:08:35.339 --> 01:08:38.603
And find out who you are.

01:08:38.703 --> 01:08:43.546
No matter what, I'm your
friend, and I always will be.

01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:48.631
Okay.

01:09:01.885 --> 01:09:03.886
Thank you.

01:09:05.247 --> 01:09:07.250
For everything.

01:09:09.973 --> 01:09:11.715
Aiden!

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.136
Will has your
dad on the line!

01:09:56.257 --> 01:09:57.919
Are you alright, dear?

01:09:58.019 --> 01:09:59.681
You look so sad.

01:09:59.781 --> 01:10:02.924
I should be alright, right?

01:10:03.024 --> 01:10:05.567
I wanted to help
him find out who he is,

01:10:05.667 --> 01:10:09.050
and we did that.

01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:11.372
And I made a new friend.

01:10:11.472 --> 01:10:14.675
But you see him as
more than a friend.

01:10:18.199 --> 01:10:21.342
I don't ask for
much, you know?

01:10:21.442 --> 01:10:24.104
The less you ask for,
the less you have to lose.

01:10:24.204 --> 01:10:29.650
So I found my adventure
in books, you know?

01:10:32.492 --> 01:10:35.195
But this week, it was
like I forgot to do that,

01:10:35.295 --> 01:10:41.161
and I realized that I'm a
little braver than I thought.

01:10:41.261 --> 01:10:44.204
You didn't think about all
the things you're normally

01:10:44.304 --> 01:10:49.609
tentative about, because
you were concerned for Aiden.

01:10:49.709 --> 01:10:55.415
Caring for others reveals
the best version of ourselves.

01:10:55.515 --> 01:10:58.257
Those were
special circumstances.

01:10:58.357 --> 01:11:00.580
I was helping him
figure out who he is.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.582
I know.

01:11:02.682 --> 01:11:07.847
And imagine what would happen if
you did the same for yourself.

01:11:16.575 --> 01:11:17.916
Oh, hey.

01:11:18.016 --> 01:11:20.199
Mrs. Henley left her
phone number in the kitchen.

01:11:20.299 --> 01:11:22.641
She said that she would be
more than happy to come by

01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:26.405
and pick up all of these
decorations whenever you want.

01:11:26.505 --> 01:11:27.726
You know I hate to admit it,

01:11:27.826 --> 01:11:30.268
but they're actually
starting to grow on me.

01:11:31.630 --> 01:11:33.632
You all set?

01:11:34.232 --> 01:11:35.854
Yeah.

01:11:35.954 --> 01:11:39.137
You really don't mind driving
me all the way back to Ohio?

01:11:39.237 --> 01:11:41.299
You have no license,
no money,

01:11:41.399 --> 01:11:43.701
and until last night,
you didn't know your name.

01:11:43.801 --> 01:11:47.004
So I'm not really comfortable
letting you drive a car.

01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:50.668
I can't believe your luck,

01:11:50.768 --> 01:11:54.272
having somebody like
Darcy to help you out.

01:11:54.372 --> 01:11:56.394
She actually went to
New York to find Melanie?

01:11:56.494 --> 01:11:57.715
Yeah, she did.

01:11:57.815 --> 01:11:59.196
Wow, that's amazing.

01:11:59.296 --> 01:12:03.000
Would you go through all that
trouble to help a stranger?

01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.363
I don't know, would I?

01:12:06.463 --> 01:12:10.007
Yeah, yeah you would.

01:12:10.107 --> 01:12:12.129
But normal people wouldn't.

01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:14.571
I don't know how
you pay that back.

01:12:14.671 --> 01:12:17.114
Actually, there
might be a way.

01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:27.864
Thank you!

01:12:27.964 --> 01:12:28.945
Good morning, Darcy.

01:12:29.045 --> 01:12:30.226
Can't talk.

01:12:30.326 --> 01:12:31.367
I've been psyching myself
up the whole ride over

01:12:31.447 --> 01:12:32.589
and I don't wanna
lose my nerve.

01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:33.870
Did something happen?

01:12:33.970 --> 01:12:35.271
Many things have happened,
I will tell you later.

01:12:35.371 --> 01:12:37.113
But right now, I am
a woman on a mission.

01:12:37.213 --> 01:12:38.394
Darcy!

01:12:38.494 --> 01:12:40.496
Yeah?

01:12:50.506 --> 01:12:52.488
Good morning, Terrence.

01:12:52.588 --> 01:12:54.290
Good morning, Darcy.

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:55.971
My, don't you
look nice today?

01:12:56.071 --> 01:12:57.332
Thank you, Terrence.

01:12:57.432 --> 01:12:58.894
I do look nice today.

01:12:58.994 --> 01:13:01.016
And in addition
to looking nice,

01:13:01.116 --> 01:13:04.499
I submit to you that I look
professional and capable.

01:13:04.599 --> 01:13:06.721
And I would agree
with that assessment.

01:13:08.924 --> 01:13:10.345
Terrence.

01:13:10.445 --> 01:13:12.347
I believe that you
deserve the right

01:13:12.447 --> 01:13:14.909
to have someone running
Chaucer's who really loves it.

01:13:15.009 --> 01:13:16.951
I concur.

01:13:17.051 --> 01:13:19.754
And I think I'm
that person, Terrence.

01:13:19.854 --> 01:13:23.197
No, I just don't
think it, I know it.

01:13:23.297 --> 01:13:26.521
And there's areas where
I'd need training of course,

01:13:26.621 --> 01:13:29.604
but I've come to appreciate
that I'm the kind of person

01:13:29.704 --> 01:13:33.848
who sees a problem and doesn't
stop until a solution is found.

01:13:33.948 --> 01:13:35.489
Do you know what
half the inventory is

01:13:35.589 --> 01:13:37.051
at Books Books Books?

01:13:37.151 --> 01:13:38.572
Not books.

01:13:38.672 --> 01:13:42.896
What we do is so special and our
community needs us and I truly--

01:13:42.996 --> 01:13:45.339
Darcy.

01:13:45.439 --> 01:13:48.902
All I ever wanted
was for you to want it.

01:13:49.002 --> 01:13:50.063
Pardon?

01:13:50.163 --> 01:13:51.505
Of course you
could run this store.

01:13:51.605 --> 01:13:52.906
I've always known that.

01:13:53.006 --> 01:13:55.188
I just needed for
you to know that.

01:13:55.288 --> 01:13:56.510
Really?

01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:59.513
I would be honored to leave
Chaucer's in your hands.

01:13:59.613 --> 01:14:00.634
Really.

01:14:00.734 --> 01:14:02.035
The job is yours.

01:14:02.135 --> 01:14:03.677
Oh my gosh, Terrence!

01:14:03.777 --> 01:14:05.238
You will not regret this.

01:14:05.338 --> 01:14:06.319
So.

01:14:06.419 --> 01:14:07.680
Let's get you started.

01:14:07.780 --> 01:14:09.122
Right now?

01:14:09.222 --> 01:14:10.563
Sunday is Christmas Eve.

01:14:10.663 --> 01:14:13.526
We have a lot of work to do.

01:14:13.626 --> 01:14:15.088
[Door knocking]

01:14:15.188 --> 01:14:16.049
Sorry to interrupt.

01:14:16.149 --> 01:14:17.610
I've got a call
on hold for you.

01:14:17.710 --> 01:14:19.091
Katherine.

01:14:19.191 --> 01:14:22.014
I would like to introduce you
to our new general manager.

01:14:22.114 --> 01:14:23.095
Oh, Darcy!

01:14:23.195 --> 01:14:24.337
I knew when you came
in with good shoes

01:14:24.437 --> 01:14:25.458
something was brewing.

01:14:25.558 --> 01:14:27.019
So maybe this call
should go to you then?

01:14:27.119 --> 01:14:28.100
Who is it?

01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:29.862
It's Anthony Cleaver Parks.

01:14:29.962 --> 01:14:32.625
He's offering to do an author
appearance on Christmas Eve.

01:14:32.725 --> 01:14:35.027
Anthony Cleaver Parks?
Here?

01:14:35.127 --> 01:14:36.188
Why?

01:14:36.288 --> 01:14:38.971
He says he's helping
a friend repay a favor.

01:14:40.812 --> 01:14:43.695
I'll take the call
in here, thanks.

01:14:45.497 --> 01:14:49.100
Okay. Bye boss!

01:14:56.988 --> 01:14:59.130
I'm just worried
I won't remember.

01:14:59.230 --> 01:15:01.632
Don't worry, you will.

01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:32.142
Sara!

01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:42.392
I remember.

01:15:44.674 --> 01:15:46.676
I remember!

01:15:58.808 --> 01:16:00.810
Wait wait!

01:16:02.051 --> 01:16:04.854
I wanted to get a
photo of you two!

01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:07.957
I know that
we're overdressed.

01:16:08.057 --> 01:16:10.399
People don't dress up to
go to the ballet anymore.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:14.883
Oscar Wilde said one can never
be overdressed or overeducated.

01:16:14.983 --> 01:16:16.485
Do you hear that, Luigi?

01:16:16.585 --> 01:16:18.687
We have Oscar's approval.

01:16:18.787 --> 01:16:20.689
I don't know him,
but he sounds like

01:16:20.789 --> 01:16:22.010
a very wise man, huh?

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:24.112
Okay, smile.

01:16:25.313 --> 01:16:26.134
Have fun, you two.

01:16:26.234 --> 01:16:26.815
Ciao.

01:16:26.915 --> 01:16:28.917
Good night.

01:16:51.338 --> 01:16:53.040
Okay everyone,
it's looking good!

01:16:53.140 --> 01:16:54.642
Let's keep up the pace!

01:16:54.742 --> 01:16:58.245
The doors open in ten minutes
and we have customers waiting!

01:16:58.345 --> 01:16:59.486
Darcy?

01:16:59.586 --> 01:17:01.168
Can you come take a
look at this for a minute?

01:17:01.268 --> 01:17:02.770
Oh, of course!

01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:04.291
Katherine, while you
have your phone out,

01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:05.692
do you mind calling
William Anderson

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:08.835
and getting an ETA
on Mr. Parks' arrival?

01:17:16.202 --> 01:17:18.945
Oh, Luigi!
This looks incredible!

01:17:19.045 --> 01:17:23.149
I could not have done it without
the help of my lovely assistant.

01:17:23.249 --> 01:17:26.052
Beauty inspires beauty.

01:17:28.494 --> 01:17:29.996
Great job with
the store, Darcy.

01:17:30.096 --> 01:17:31.718
The place looks
extraordinary!

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:33.039
Thank you, Terrence.

01:17:33.139 --> 01:17:36.022
Our special
guests have arrived.

01:17:37.583 --> 01:17:39.585
Darcy!

01:17:43.429 --> 01:17:45.211
I'd like you to meet
Anthony Cleaver Parks.

01:17:45.311 --> 01:17:48.053
Tony, this is the
amazing Darcy Archer.

01:17:48.153 --> 01:17:49.575
It's nice to finally
meet you in person.

01:17:49.675 --> 01:17:51.457
Me?

01:17:51.557 --> 01:17:54.139
Thank you so much for all of
the online promotion you did.

01:17:54.239 --> 01:17:55.741
We've been getting
calls all day.

01:17:55.841 --> 01:17:58.543
I'm glad to get your store
as much attention as I can.

01:17:58.643 --> 01:18:01.346
We really appreciate it.

01:18:01.446 --> 01:18:03.108
Josh, do you
think you could show

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:04.789
the reading area
to Mr. Parks?

01:18:04.889 --> 01:18:07.752
Please, my friends
call me Tony.

01:18:07.852 --> 01:18:08.833
Okay.

01:18:08.933 --> 01:18:11.396
This way, Mr. Parks.

01:18:11.496 --> 01:18:13.498
Or should I say Tony?

01:18:16.781 --> 01:18:18.483
Well, you're done
for the year.

01:18:18.583 --> 01:18:21.425
Nobody's gonna top
that Christmas present.

01:18:24.268 --> 01:18:26.550
Honey, what's wrong?

01:18:28.112 --> 01:18:30.254
Nothing.

01:18:30.354 --> 01:18:32.356
I just...

01:18:33.557 --> 01:18:38.022
I can't but wish that I could
tell Aiden about all of this.

01:18:38.122 --> 01:18:39.183
And you can.

01:18:39.283 --> 01:18:41.185
He's still your friend.

01:18:41.285 --> 01:18:44.428
I know, I just...

01:18:44.528 --> 01:18:47.110
I spent so much
time telling myself

01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:50.273
that Aiden was
all wrong for me.

01:18:50.373 --> 01:18:54.357
That he lived some
fantasy life with the travel

01:18:54.457 --> 01:18:59.402
and the fancy clothes and that
house that looked like a hotel.

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:04.647
But, in the end, I didn't
realize I was looking for anyone

01:19:04.747 --> 01:19:09.772
until he turned out to be
everything I was looking for.

01:19:09.872 --> 01:19:12.175
And now I know
what I'm missing.

01:19:12.275 --> 01:19:14.857
Even if the time you had
together is all you get,

01:19:14.957 --> 01:19:17.760
look how much
it's done for you!

01:19:19.802 --> 01:19:22.665
Also, I really
want a dog now.

01:19:22.765 --> 01:19:24.867
That we can do.

01:19:24.967 --> 01:19:26.388
Look around you, Darcy!

01:19:26.488 --> 01:19:27.870
At your store!

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:29.471
You did this!

01:19:29.571 --> 01:19:32.894
You just have to believe
that anything is possible.

01:19:40.021 --> 01:19:42.264
Hey everybody,
Merry Christmas!

01:20:11.091 --> 01:20:13.554
Laura lived in a
little house with her pa,

01:20:13.654 --> 01:20:18.038
her ma, and her big sister
Mary, her little sister Carrie,

01:20:18.138 --> 01:20:22.202
and their good
old bulldog, Jack.

01:20:22.302 --> 01:20:24.304
See?

01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:29.329
Are there any
questions?

01:20:29.429 --> 01:20:30.811
Yes, ma'am?

01:20:30.911 --> 01:20:34.894
Mr. Parks, what made you decide
to set a story at Christmas?

01:20:34.994 --> 01:20:36.496
There's just something
about the holidays,

01:20:36.596 --> 01:20:37.537
isn't there?

01:20:37.637 --> 01:20:39.979
The air is heavy
with possibility.

01:20:40.079 --> 01:20:41.781
It's the time of year
where we really believe

01:20:41.881 --> 01:20:44.704
that our dreams
can come true.

01:20:44.804 --> 01:20:47.827
And it's those expectations
that enhance the story...

01:20:47.927 --> 01:20:49.308
Bailey?

01:20:49.408 --> 01:20:52.251
I think he's just
here for the food.

01:20:53.372 --> 01:20:55.194
What are you doing here?

01:20:55.294 --> 01:20:57.236
Well, I was looking for
something to do tonight,

01:20:57.336 --> 01:20:58.838
so I went over to
Books Books Books,

01:20:58.938 --> 01:21:01.560
but man, it is
dead over there.

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:05.324
I meant why
aren't you in Ohio?

01:21:05.424 --> 01:21:08.046
You see those people?

01:21:08.146 --> 01:21:11.250
Well that handsome older
gentleman happens my dad.

01:21:11.350 --> 01:21:12.891
His name is Stanley,
by the way.

01:21:12.991 --> 01:21:15.894
He wanted to thank you for
taking such good care of me.

01:21:15.994 --> 01:21:18.857
And that sweet
little girl?

01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:21.980
That's my niece, Sara.

01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.743
And that lovely lady wearing
that beautiful diamond ring

01:21:24.843 --> 01:21:27.625
that we thought was lost
forever?

01:21:27.725 --> 01:21:30.568
That's Jenny.

01:21:31.929 --> 01:21:33.931
My sister.

01:21:36.093 --> 01:21:37.635
Your sister?

01:21:37.735 --> 01:21:39.557
The ring was a gift.

01:21:39.657 --> 01:21:41.899
For my sister.

01:21:45.663 --> 01:21:47.965
I'd like to thank the
staff of Chaucer's Bookstore,

01:21:48.065 --> 01:21:50.528
particularly the general
manager, Darcy Archer,

01:21:50.628 --> 01:21:51.729
for welcoming me here.

01:21:51.829 --> 01:21:53.831
It's been an
absolute pleasure.

01:22:04.721 --> 01:22:07.023
Thank you again,
Anthony Cleaver Parks!

01:22:07.123 --> 01:22:10.887
[Clapping]

01:22:11.408 --> 01:22:14.310
And thank you to you,
all of you,

01:22:14.410 --> 01:22:17.714
for making this the best
Christmas Eve at Chaucer's ever!

01:22:17.814 --> 01:22:27.263
[Clapping]

01:22:51.406 --> 01:22:52.908
Darcy?

01:22:53.008 --> 01:22:54.990
Hi, I'm Aiden's sister,
Jenny.

01:22:55.090 --> 01:22:56.832
And this is my
daughter, Sara.

01:22:56.932 --> 01:22:57.833
Hi Sara!

01:22:57.933 --> 01:22:58.994
Hi!

01:22:59.094 --> 01:23:01.436
It is wonderful
to meet both of you.

01:23:01.536 --> 01:23:02.998
I don't know what
would've happened.

01:23:03.098 --> 01:23:04.479
If you hadn't
taken care of Bailey,

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:05.920
if you hadn't helped Aiden...

01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:07.802
We probably wouldn't have
even known he was missing

01:23:07.902 --> 01:23:09.444
until Christmas Day.

01:23:09.544 --> 01:23:11.326
Thank you so much.

01:23:11.426 --> 01:23:14.048
Your brother is a
very special guy.

01:23:14.148 --> 01:23:15.770
Yeah he is.

01:23:15.870 --> 01:23:17.091
I can't believe he
went through all that,

01:23:17.191 --> 01:23:19.974
and he found Mom's ring.

01:23:20.074 --> 01:23:23.978
It feels like a
Christmas miracle.

01:23:24.078 --> 01:23:25.739
Do you know
where he might be?

01:23:25.839 --> 01:23:27.581
I think he took
Bailey outside.

01:23:27.681 --> 01:23:29.683
Thank you.

01:23:37.771 --> 01:23:39.833
My favorite authors
are William Faulkner

01:23:39.933 --> 01:23:42.315
and Patricia Highsmith.

01:23:42.415 --> 01:23:46.840
Strangers on a Train
is one of my favorites.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.001
See?

01:23:48.101 --> 01:23:51.204
Like I said, now I know
you a little better.

01:23:51.304 --> 01:23:54.307
Now I know me a
little better, too.

01:23:56.629 --> 01:23:59.092
I've been trying to
separate the things

01:23:59.192 --> 01:24:01.614
we thought we knew
from the things

01:24:01.714 --> 01:24:02.895
that turned out
to be true.

01:24:02.995 --> 01:24:05.097
Let me see if I can help.

01:24:05.197 --> 01:24:06.539
Hi.

01:24:06.639 --> 01:24:07.860
I'm Aiden Harris.

01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:09.862
And this is
my dog, Bailey.

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:12.625
Well it is nice
to meet you both.

01:24:12.725 --> 01:24:14.727
I'm Darcy Archer.

01:24:15.728 --> 01:24:19.151
So what do you do
for a living, Aiden?

01:24:19.251 --> 01:24:20.993
I'm an art teacher.

01:24:21.093 --> 01:24:23.595
How about you?

01:24:23.695 --> 01:24:25.838
I run the best bookstore
in the whole world.

01:24:25.938 --> 01:24:27.559
What? This is your place?

01:24:27.659 --> 01:24:29.641
You run this?
For how long?

01:24:29.741 --> 01:24:31.943
A whole 24 hours.

01:24:34.105 --> 01:24:37.128
So, do you
live around here?

01:24:37.228 --> 01:24:39.591
Currently I'm in Ohio,

01:24:40.752 --> 01:24:43.415
but I'm
considering a move.

01:24:43.515 --> 01:24:45.016
Really?

01:24:45.116 --> 01:24:47.118
Really.

01:24:47.959 --> 01:24:50.101
And why is that?

01:24:50.201 --> 01:24:53.744
A wise, beautiful friend
of mine once told me

01:24:53.844 --> 01:24:55.746
that when I found
myself standing in front

01:24:55.846 --> 01:24:58.829
of the woman that I
was meant to be with,

01:24:58.929 --> 01:25:00.931
I'd know.

01:25:01.572 --> 01:25:03.574
And?

01:25:04.174 --> 01:25:06.176
She was right.

01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:11.181
Well, it was a pleasure
to meet you, Aiden.

01:25:12.583 --> 01:25:14.585
Merry Christmas.

01:25:16.506 --> 01:25:18.588
Merry Christmas, Darcy.
