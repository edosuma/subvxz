00:04.710 --> 00:06.070
nostalgia--

00:06.070 --> 00:08.880
Seems everyone is stuck reliving their pasts.

00:08.880 --> 00:09.960
I don't get it.

00:09.960 --> 00:12.470
Of course,that might be because I don't have a past,

00:12.470 --> 00:17.710
but it seems silly making a big deal out of something that's not a big deal anymore.

00:20.810 --> 00:23.130

There's this cheerleader for the team,And she's way too flexible for my liking.

02:04.480 --> 02:08.960
Yeah,she might actually be a threat,because she's met him.

02:09.380 --> 02:14.780
You know, just because we have not met does not mean we do not have something special.

02:14.780 --> 02:18.530

02:18.530 --> 02:22.350

03:12.860 --> 03:14.800
He's playing a show this weekend.

03:14.800 --> 03:16.340
He kind of has an ego,though.

03:16.340 --> 03:18.090
He was so shocked I hadn't heard of him. 

03:18.090 --> 03:19.450
What's his name?

03:19.450 --> 03:21.030

03:45.020 --> 03:47.380
Oh,god,look at him in that jacket.

03:47.380 --> 03:51.310
Oh,my god. He's gonna be so embarrassed when he remembers he looked like that.

03:51.310 --> 03:53.470
Oh,god. We all looked like that. 

03:53.470 --> 03:55.240
- Oh,I know.
- Oh,my god. 

03:55.240 --> 03:59.010
See,when we were 13, we were so in love with tommy wylder.

03:59.010 --> 04:02.010
We bought the,uh, "king of hearts" album,and we cracked up,

04:02.010 --> 04:05.410
because you said it sounded like the "king of farts." 

04:05.410 --> 04:07.800
And then you said I was the queen of farts,

04:07.800 --> 04:11.360
and we-- we laughed so hard that my mom tried to pull over the car.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.850
I want to meet him. I think he'll find that story charming. 

04:14.850 --> 04:18.170
Hey,samantha,why don't you ask him if he's looking for a new crib?

04:18.170 --> 04:20.250
And we could put it on our business cards--

04:20.250 --> 04:22.000
"real estate agents to the stars." 

04:22.000 --> 04:24.440
it already says that on our business cards,mom.

04:24.440 --> 04:25.750
So now it'll be true. 

04:25.750 --> 04:28.900
Still,I don't get it.I don't get how we could worship somebody that we've never met

04:28.900 --> 04:31.570
and who shows absolutely no interest in us at all. 

04:31.570 --> 04:33.530
What is all this talk again?

04:33.530 --> 04:36.510
If you don't want to go to church with us,don't go.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.040
No. No. Sam is gonna marry tommy wylder.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.520
And we're gonna sell him a new house.

04:40.520 --> 04:43.500
Oh,guys,I'm only going on my first date with him tonight. 

04:43.500 --> 04:46.560
Don't do it,sam.A musician is married to one woman,

04:46.560 --> 04:49.690
and her name is lady rock 'n' roll.

04:49.690 --> 04:52.440
And then he has lots of other women he has sex with.

04:52.440 --> 04:55.980
Howard, shis her mother's daughter.She has a lu for the rockers.

04:55.980 --> 04:57.700
Probably gonna marry one like I did.

04:57.700 --> 04:59.850
You were married to somebody before dad?

04:59.850 --> 05:01.620
Why does nobody tell me this stuff?

05:01.620 --> 05:03.360
No,I mean your father.

05:03.360 --> 05:05.460
He was the lead singer in a band.

05:05.460 --> 05:08.100
Yeah,the shadowmakers.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.950
The what-y hooters?

05:09.950 --> 05:11.450
He was good.

05:11.450 --> 05:13.440
You should have seen him on stage.

05:13.440 --> 05:16.020
His sweat would sort of glisten in his chest hair,

05:16.020 --> 05:17.520
and he'd lick his lips really slow-- 

05:17.520 --> 05:20.540
okay,okay,too far. Too far.

05:20.540 --> 05:22.550
Oh,but then a certain little someone came along,

05:22.550 --> 05:26.200
and he dided to lose the leopard skin pants and get a real job. 

05:26.200 --> 05:28.250
Because of me?

05:28.250 --> 05:30.600
Oh,great. I killed my father's dream.

05:30.600 --> 05:32.420
You know,leave it to you to make it all about yourself.

05:32.420 --> 05:36.390
What aboutmydream? I thought i'd married a rock star.

05:36.390 --> 05:38.900
I could have died young.

05:41.200 --> 05:43.260
Come on. Come on. Come on. "king of farts."

05:43.260 --> 05:46.010
Just say it real fast. Tell me you do not hear that.

05:46.010 --> 05:48.800
Well,I do now, and I always will.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.380
I'm sorry.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.610
We're sorry to bother you, but we love you so much. 

05:53.610 --> 05:54.650
Would you mind?

05:54.650 --> 05:56.750
- Sure. 
- Please.

05:56.750 --> 05:59.480
I lost my virginity to you.

05:59.480 --> 06:01.730
She means the music. Right?

06:01.730 --> 06:06.710
I lost mine to prince, but one of your songs totally got me through my eating disorder.

06:06.710 --> 06:09.900
Oh,thank you so much. Oh,my god.

06:09.900 --> 06:11.450
That must be so weird.

06:11.450 --> 06:13.940
Yeah,but free pens. 

06:13.940 --> 06:17.720
No,just women o don't know you just freaking out about you all the time?

06:17.720 --> 06:20.220
That's why I'm here with you, a nice,pretty gl

06:20.220 --> 06:23.680
who isn't afraid to tell me my biggest album is a fart joke.

06:23.680 --> 06:27.860
It's great to not have all the hero worship stuff with you.

06:31.640 --> 06:33.790
Could you excuse me for just one second?

06:33.790 --> 06:37.720
Female problems. Two of them.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.530
Get in there. Get in there. 

06:40.530 --> 06:41.670
Are you kidding me?

06:41.670 --> 06:44.410
What are you guys doing here and what are you wearing?

06:44.410 --> 06:48.640
I just want to shake tommy's hand and then put that hand inside a plastic bag.

06:48.640 --> 06:49.930
Do you have a rubber band? 

06:49.930 --> 06:52.540
Okay, please do not dork out on me.

06:52.540 --> 06:55.780
Well... Um,tell her. I mean,I know how to act around a celebrity.

07:00.430 --> 07:01.670

07:10.590 --> 07:13.580
Got it. I just want to say hello to him

07:13.580 --> 07:15.540
and then ask him to sing at my dog's birthday party.

07:15.540 --> 07:17.700
Okay,let's go over the rules again. Shall we? 

07:17.700 --> 07:19.800

07:47.930 --> 07:49.620

09:12.750 --> 09:14.610
He was here? He was in the house?

09:14.610 --> 09:17.630
Oh! And he sat in that chair, and his feet were on that floor,

09:17.630 --> 09:21.210
and you can still see the spot on the ceiling where he ascended to heaven.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.190
 Jealous much?

09:22.190 --> 09:23.270
Oh,yeah,I'm so jealous.

09:23.270 --> 09:25.240
By the way,sam,I sti can't find my sunglasses.

09:25.240 --> 09:29.260
Oh,fothe last time,he did not steal your sunglasses.

09:29.260 --> 09:31.100
Look,I just know they were here before he showed up and said,

09:31.100 --> 09:36.040
"cool sunglasses,dude." you kn,maybe Mr. Platinum record has a little problem. That's all I'm saying.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.950
Hey. No crumbs. I sleep on that couch. 

09:38.950 --> 09:41.810
Dude,you sleep on a couch,and your ex is dating tommy wylder.

09:41.810 --> 09:45.060

10:03.380 --> 10:05.470
Dena embarrasses you. Me,too. Me,too.

10:05.470 --> 10:07.840
That's why I have not introduced her to tony dane yet.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.860
Yeah,you know,it's not... Just dena.

10:10.860 --> 10:11.990
Excuse me. What now?

10:11.990 --> 10:14.930
Come on,andrea. The other night with the crazy fan stuff? 

10:14.930 --> 10:16.840
Iembarrass you? Me?

10:16.840 --> 10:18.340
Please don't make this a thing. 

10:18.340 --> 10:21.580
It's too late. A thing has been made.Yeah. 

10:21.580 --> 10:24.650
Okay,sam,I have to go to that concert with you.

10:24.650 --> 10:26.190
I mean,tommy was ours.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.150
You know,don't you remember, every day after school--

10:28.150 --> 10:31.630
No,I don't remember,okay? I don't remember.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.810
Th-this isn't about the good old days for me,all right?

10:33.810 --> 10:36.170
You keep trying to bring me back to being 13 years old,

10:36.170 --> 10:38.590
but this is about a guy that I'm datingnow,all right,

10:38.590 --> 10:43.940
who just so happens to be a musician. That's it.

10:44.120 --> 10:47.780
I guess you're right.I don't know what I was thinking.

10:47.780 --> 10:51.530
- Look,I'm sorry,dena. I don't mean to sound like I don't care.
- Nope. Nope. Andrea,let's go.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.700
- I hope you're happy--
- I said let's go. 

10:53.700 --> 10:56.470
Come on.

10:57.430 --> 10:59.450
Okay. Someone's been trying on my shoes.

10:59.450 --> 11:02.060
Oh,just stop it!

11:03.690 --> 11:05.970
I mean,I'm sure I have.I just don't really remember. 

11:05.970 --> 11:09.300
Not because I was on drugs or anything,just because I have sort of a condition.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.280
Oh,these are sort of close. It's gonna be really loud.

11:12.280 --> 11:16.440
Is there anything better back... There? I guess not.

11:17.050 --> 11:22.550
Uh,I think I'm over here. Excuse me.Sorry. Thanks.

12:45.700 --> 12:47.280
would you mind?

12:47.280 --> 12:48.770
I think we get it after 20 times.

12:48.770 --> 12:51.810
He used to be with that girl. Now she's with this guy. Got it.

12:51.810 --> 12:53.600
Look. It's a snow globe.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.190
It's a picture of him from their concert in paris in 1986.

12:56.190 --> 12:57.900
Damn,I wish I could have been there.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.350
I can't believe I was not there. Oh! Oh!

13:00.350 --> 13:03.600
I have to sh-show you all the pictures...From-- from the concert from last night.

13:03.600 --> 13:04.840
I was so close to the stage! 

13:04.840 --> 13:06.680
No,I don't want to. I don't like tommy wylder.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.950
I never liked tommy wylder. I think he's lame. 

13:08.950 --> 13:10.160
That's 'cause you're stupid.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.280
What has happened to you? 

13:11.280 --> 13:13.150
Nothing's happened to me,okay?

13:13.150 --> 13:15.290
I just finally know what dena was talking about.

13:15.290 --> 13:18.280
I mean,I loved himsomuch. 

13:18.280 --> 13:19.800
Just turn it down.

13:19.800 --> 13:24.340
You know,you don't get it. I just wish that you could feel what it feels like to have feelings.

13:24.340 --> 13:28.400
Oh,god. Please don't play that one again. Please?

13:34.770 --> 13:36.510
Thanks.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.310
Guys? What are you doing here? Wh--

13:40.310 --> 13:42.500
I- I left you,like, five messages last night.

13:42.500 --> 13:43.870
I have to tell you about the concert.

13:43.870 --> 13:47.170
Okay,look, I- I stole tommy's towel,

13:47.170 --> 13:49.750
and it still has his sweat on it.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.500
Oh,my--

13:51.500 --> 13:53.660
Hey-- hey,what's going on?

13:53.660 --> 13:55.150
We're ignoring you.

13:55.150 --> 13:57.010
You don't say it. You just do it.

13:57.010 --> 14:00.240
Come on. We have a dog's birthday to plan.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.460
Oh,come on,you guy--

14:02.460 --> 14:05.130
You're not still mad about the concert,are you?

14:05.130 --> 14:08.610
Look,you couldn't go. you were acting totally lame.

14:08.610 --> 14:11.250
We need a theme-- A murder mystery!

14:11.250 --> 14:12.680
Like you're really into this party. 

14:12.680 --> 14:14.130
At least I'm going to the party.

14:14.130 --> 14:16.510
So am i. I'm bringing the fire hydrant cake.

14:16.510 --> 14:19.500
Well,maybe,sam, it'd be better if youdidn'tgo.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.500
- What? 
- Yeah,because you might be seen with us,

14:21.500 --> 14:24.030
and we mightembarrassyou.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.500
Dena,please don't make me feel bad about this,all right?

14:26.500 --> 14:27.960
I am living out a dream here. 

14:27.960 --> 14:29.220
Ourdream.

14:29.220 --> 14:33.340
Now you have tommy wylder all to yourself,you're better than us?

14:33.340 --> 14:36.880
Oh,come on. I am still the same old sam.I have not changed.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.950
Decaf latte for samantha wylder.

14:38.950 --> 14:41.730
That's me! What?

14:44.490 --> 14:46.310
Howard?

14:46.310 --> 14:49.180
What are you doing? I found this on the stairs.

14:49.180 --> 14:52.140
I'm going over the books. We're getting audited next month.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.870
I turn my back for one second, you stop practicing the guitar?

14:54.870 --> 14:56.120
Practicing for what? 

14:56.120 --> 14:58.790
For a gig! I've been putting feelers out.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.280
You know phil remy over at the ramada?

15:00.280 --> 15:03.460
He said that if that gal that plays the piano--You know,with the lazy eye and the fog machine?

15:03.460 --> 15:04.750
If she gets sick, he's gonna call.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.150
Now here. Wait a second. I got you something.

15:06.150 --> 15:09.790
I'm not playing the ramada. I'm going through the books.

15:09.790 --> 15:12.200
Look. Look,look,look.It's just like the one you used to wear!

15:12.200 --> 15:14.690
Come on,just for a second. oh.

15:21.700 --> 15:24.510
Ay,take me right now. oh!Take me right now.

15:24.510 --> 15:27.660
And we're going to jail. Now,now.

15:27.660 --> 15:30.210
Tommy wylder.

15:31.600 --> 15:34.540
We're together.

15:34.540 --> 15:36.920
I'm with him. I'm actually with him,with him.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.620
So lunch was fun,huh? Do you wanna do something else?

15:39.620 --> 15:41.600
I kinda have to be in the studio.

15:41.600 --> 15:44.020
Oh. You're writing a song,huh? Is it about me?

15:44.020 --> 15:45.620
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.400
I'm sure it's really hard to rhyme things with "samantha."

15:48.400 --> 15:51.650
Maybe "pantha"? I don't know. 

15:51.650 --> 15:53.720
 I - I just wanted to say I'm a big fan,

15:53.720 --> 15:54.770
and,uh,I play some guitar myself.

15:54.770 --> 15:59.810
Back off,frank! Okay,he is not public property,so chill.

15:59.810 --> 16:03.070
Fans,huh? I mean,whatisthat?

16:03.070 --> 16:07.810
Speaking of which,did you call me,like, ten times today and hang up?

16:07.810 --> 16:10.090
No,I don't-- No,I don't think so.

16:10.090 --> 16:13.090
You know what?Maybe my phone dialed from inside my purse,

16:13.090 --> 16:15.400
because that happens to people, for reals.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.090
- U wanna come up for a sec? 
- no.

16:17.090 --> 16:19.440
We could watch your music videos-- what? 

16:19.440 --> 16:23.360
Sam,I think it's time for me to step off.

16:23.360 --> 16:24.330
"step off"?

16:24.330 --> 16:27.460
It's been fun,but you--You're starting to get a little freaky on me. 

16:27.460 --> 16:28.860
It's michelle,isn't it?

16:28.860 --> 16:29.680
who?

16:29.680 --> 16:32.040
From your song, "paris lover."

16:32.040 --> 16:33.720
You sing about that girl michelle.

16:33.720 --> 16:36.770
It just seemed like it must've been really intense.

16:36.770 --> 16:40.130
I mean,the lyrics are really sweet and everything,but she kind of seems like a wacko.

16:40.130 --> 16:43.070
Right. So I'm gonna take a really confusing way home.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.950
Don't try and follow me,okay? Good-bye.

16:45.950 --> 16:47.430
T- tomm y,I-- No,come on! Don't do that!

16:47.430 --> 16:51.490
I'm not usually like this! I'm not-- I love you!

16:51.490 --> 16:54.370
I love you! Don't... Go.

16:54.370 --> 16:56.950
Come on. Let's move you inside quietly...

16:56.950 --> 16:59.280
Like a "pantha."

16:59.280 --> 17:01.620
I love him.

17:07.230 --> 17:09.609
Here you go,sweetie.

17:09.609 --> 17:13.300
I brought you peanut butter and pickle on an english muffin.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.140
It's-- it's one of your favorites.

17:16.140 --> 17:17.250
Is it really?

17:17.250 --> 17:21.540
Because you usually say that when you're just trying to clean out the fridge.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.670
This one's real. Eat it.

17:23.670 --> 17:24.829
God,what happened to me?

17:24.829 --> 17:28.890
I was fine,un-until I-I saw tommy up on that stage,

17:28.890 --> 17:30.570
and then all of a sudden, I was just like...

17:30.570 --> 17:32.680
Oh,my god! Uhh!

17:32.680 --> 17:34.560
- Samantha... 
- So...

17:34.560 --> 17:37.810
It's designed that way. You're there in the dark,

17:37.810 --> 17:42.100
everything falls away, and it's just the two of you.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.690
And the passion...

17:43.690 --> 17:45.930
No one has ever understood you the way he does. 

17:45.930 --> 17:47.510
Oh,god,no,I know!

17:47.510 --> 17:49.700
And your heart starts to beat a little faster,

17:49.700 --> 17:51.340
and you get flushed... 

17:51.340 --> 17:54.620
And you imagine that the two of you belong together. 

17:55.180 --> 17:57.210
And then your father starts doing this little thing with his hips,and you--

17:57.210 --> 18:00.810
 no! No! Too far. Too far.

18:00.810 --> 18:04.880
Oh,boy. I've seen that look before.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.430
Another victim of rock 'n' roll,huh?

18:07.430 --> 18:09.410
Musicians stink.

18:09.410 --> 18:12.290
You should be thanking me for saving you from that life.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.340
Well,thank you. Why?

18:14.340 --> 18:17.540
Because I... Killed your dream?

18:17.540 --> 18:22.370
It's okay.Mom told me that you gave up everything because she got pregnant with me.

18:22.370 --> 18:24.700
 What? You told her that?

18:24.700 --> 18:27.040
Well,I'm not gonna lie to her,howard.

18:27.040 --> 18:28.640
You know how I feel about that.

18:28.640 --> 18:33.390
Sammy,you had nothing to do with how my life turned out.

18:33.390 --> 18:36.890
Okay?imade my choice. In fact,you were my excuse.

18:36.890 --> 18:41.770
Howard,just tell her you quit because you wanted to be a responsible father.

18:41.770 --> 18:45.120
No,I quit because I didn't want to be a musician anymore.

18:45.120 --> 18:49.450
That's not true! Stop that. You loved playing in that band.

18:49.450 --> 18:52.140
No,youloved that I was playing in that band.

18:52.140 --> 18:55.280
Admit it-- If-- if I was the waiter when you walked into the club that night

18:55.280 --> 18:58.100
instead of the guy up on the stage,would you have given me a second look? 

18:58.100 --> 19:02.260
Yes... No.

19:02.260 --> 19:04.600
But-- but look,l-look, look,look. Look,howard...

19:04.600 --> 19:07.450
You haven't picked up a guitar in over 30 years.

19:07.450 --> 19:09.980
You'll leave your fingernail clippings in the sink.

19:09.980 --> 19:11.970
I'm still here.

19:11.970 --> 19:18.060
Wait a minute.So now you're saying I just went into debt over a guilt guitar for absolutely nothing?

19:18.060 --> 19:19.070
You wanna take it back? 

19:19.070 --> 19:20.900
Yeah,i wanna take it back.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.200
No,not for nothing.

19:24.200 --> 19:26.620
Oh. For a few days,I got to...

19:26.620 --> 19:30.980
Look at your father with that guitar,and it was 35 years ago all over again.

19:30.980 --> 19:36.600
Regina, every time I look at you,it's 35 years ago again.

19:40.870 --> 19:43.950
Okay,if music can stir passions ofallkinds,

19:43.950 --> 19:47.340
then chances are, it can also soothe them.

19:47.340 --> 19:48.830
dad?

19:48.830 --> 19:53.160
Do you think you've got one more gig left in you?

19:53.160 --> 19:56.340
All right,let's here it for the shadowmakers!

19:56.340 --> 19:58.190
Shadowmakers?

19:58.190 --> 20:00.910
Dena,I am so sorry.

20:00.910 --> 20:03.000
Look,I know I don't rember that tommy was our thing,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.870
but just because I don't remember stuff doesn't mean that it didn't happen

20:05.870 --> 20:08.430
and that it didn't matter to somebody else.

20:08.430 --> 20:12.710
So I really need you to keep reminding me when it did,okay?

20:12.710 --> 20:14.670
Okay.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.740
Remember that time we called all the hotels to see where he-- 

20:16.740 --> 20:18.290
I don't remember.

20:18.290 --> 20:19.520
Remember that time there was only one album-- 

20:19.520 --> 20:22.490
no,I still have amnesia,though.Is there cake? 

20:22.490 --> 20:25.070
Yes,yes,yes,yes.

20:28.350 --> 20:31.850
They're gonna blow the roof off the ramada.

20:36.230 --> 20:39.240
what are you doing with her?! You are terrible at this.

20:39.240 --> 20:41.650
No,it's okay. She broke up with tommy,

20:41.650 --> 20:44.010
and-- and she apologized for being an ass.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.850
- I mean,reallyan ass. You weresuchan ass. 
- I know.

20:46.850 --> 20:51.550
All right,fine,great.Now let's go. I'm at a dog party.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.860
So I get it now-- nostalgia.

20:53.860 --> 20:57.930
With nostalgia,idohave a past-- the same one as theirs.

20:57.930 --> 21:01.780
And as long as I have that, I can never be alone.
