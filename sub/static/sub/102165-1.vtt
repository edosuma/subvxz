man:
<i>  Not as the complainant,</i>
<i>  as the witness.</i>

11:18.420 --> 11:19.569
<i>  Someone else</i>
<i>  is pressing charges.</i>

11:19.571 --> 11:20.846
Who?

11:20.923 --> 11:21.338
(elevator door dings)

11:24.910 --> 11:25.467
Jamie!

11:26.912 --> 11:27.427
(sighs)

11:28.931 --> 11:29.021
Is it true?

11:31.417 --> 11:32.098
You're pressing charges
against Jerod?

11:40.776 --> 11:42.701
Yes,
I'm pressing charges.

11:42.778 --> 11:44.202
We agreed not to.

11:44.279 --> 11:45.445
No, no, no.
We didn't agree
to anything.

11:45.522 --> 11:46.872
So, what is this?

11:46.949 --> 11:48.373
Is this you
getting back at me?

11:48.450 --> 11:49.524
Callie,
if that was the case,

11:49.601 --> 11:50.951
I could just press charges
against you

11:51.027 --> 11:52.702
for stealing
privileged documents
from my briefcase.

11:54.773 --> 11:55.205
So why are you
doing this then?

11:56.942 --> 11:59.276
Jerod moved back here
and started acting
erratically again.

11:59.278 --> 12:02.446
He could've wandered
into somebody else's apartment
and hurt someone

12:02.448 --> 12:03.296
or got himself shot
by some idiot with a gun.

12:03.373 --> 12:05.223
I was doing it
to protect him.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.041
Oh, you really think
he's safer in jail?

12:07.119 --> 12:08.802
Yes, I do.
And as much
as I would love

12:08.878 --> 12:10.804
to replay this track from
our Greatest Fights album,

12:10.880 --> 12:11.388
I have a meeting to get to.

12:17.646 --> 12:18.061
-This is so good.
-Hmm.

12:21.224 --> 12:22.741
I still can't believe
you've never had<i>  raspados</i>  .

12:22.818 --> 12:24.910
Whoever thought
of combining a snow cone
with fruit and sweet milk

12:24.987 --> 12:26.636
is a genius.

12:26.638 --> 12:27.895
It's the simple things
in life, you know?

12:27.973 --> 12:28.822
(Malika chuckles)

12:31.310 --> 12:31.741
So, how long have you been
interning with DPN?

12:33.570 --> 12:33.994
About five, six months.
You?

12:35.405 --> 12:36.037
A few weeks.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.651
And is this what interns do
when they're supposed
to be out running errands?

12:41.653 --> 12:41.743
It wasn't our fault
the printers weren't ready.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.930
And it really takes two of us
to pick up some posters?

12:46.825 --> 12:49.101
Imani thought maybe
you could stand to get
out of the office, you know?

12:49.177 --> 12:50.602
Get your mind off things.

12:50.679 --> 12:52.496
I mean, why is everyone
so worried about me?
I'm fine.

12:52.498 --> 12:54.106
Okay, good.

-Oh, I'm sorry.

Okay.

Mariana knows, Isabella.

Yeah.

They wouldn't
give me my meds,

leave my cell.

suing for excessive force?

23:00.605 --> 23:02.363

Uh-huh. It's fine.

36:11.578 --> 36:13.061
-Gael: Hook it up!
-Thank you, guys.

36:13.063 --> 36:13.896
Alice:
This is the fancy stuff.

36:13.898 --> 36:15.580
To Callie,

36:15.657 --> 36:16.790
my brilliant
and beautiful sister.

36:18.493 --> 36:19.902
-Congratulations!
-Thank you!

36:19.904 --> 36:21.737
-Congrats, Callie.
-all: Cheers!

36:21.739 --> 36:24.464
Oh, um, and I guess
we have something else
to toast.

36:25.667 --> 36:26.133
What?

36:28.245 --> 36:29.845
Okay. I'll do it.

36:31.598 --> 36:32.180
On one condition.

36:34.101 --> 36:34.975
You quit Legal Aid
and come work for me.

36:39.423 --> 36:41.256
Callie:
<i>  Uh, I have a new job.</i>

36:41.258 --> 36:46.203
I'm gonna be working
for this small non-profit
criminal defense firm,

36:46.280 --> 36:48.539
run by this kind of
well-known attorney,
Kathleen Gale.

36:48.615 --> 36:50.707
Wow!

36:50.784 --> 36:52.358
So you're gonna be
like Elle Woods?

36:52.436 --> 36:52.543
(imitates Elle Woods):
What? Like it's hard?

36:53.787 --> 36:54.161
-That's funny.
-Nice.

36:55.773 --> 36:56.037
Well, to Callie,

36:57.107 --> 36:58.457
who better to have
defending you?

37:00.535 --> 37:01.042
Alice:
Preach.

37:06.450 --> 37:08.116
When you said
you totally understand

37:08.118 --> 37:08.967
running into
someone else's arms...

37:11.121 --> 37:12.137
did you... with Gael?

37:15.459 --> 37:16.183
No. Of course not.

37:20.798 --> 37:21.238
You okay?

37:22.483 --> 37:24.057
Yeah.

37:24.134 --> 37:24.566
Where's Dennis?

37:25.803 --> 37:26.743
He went out of town.
Staying with a friend.

37:29.473 --> 37:31.397
Oh, wait!

37:31.475 --> 37:35.477
We're also celebrating
Callie moving back
into our loft.

37:35.479 --> 37:36.402
-Callie: Yes.
-Mariana: Yay!

37:36.480 --> 37:37.245
Wait, what about Isabella?

37:38.073 --> 37:40.415
Oh, uh... She moved out.

Hi.

37:58.519 --> 38:00.836
Hey.

38:00.838 --> 38:02.595
I got this mescal
in Oaxaca,

38:02.673 --> 38:04.397
and I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

38:06.434 --> 38:07.275
And what's the occasion?

38:09.179 --> 38:10.070
I'm lonely.

38:16.520 --> 38:16.793
I don't think
this is a good idea.

38:19.023 --> 38:21.465
I'm lonely. You're lonely.
We're both single.

38:47.718 --> 38:49.109

Oh, uh... No.

38:53.982 --> 38:55.891
I just came home,
she was gone.

38:55.893 --> 38:58.410
She didn't leave a note,
and she's not responding
to any of my texts.

38:59.988 --> 39:00.620
I hope she's okay.

39:02.066 --> 39:03.999
She's a survivor.
I wouldn't worry
about that one.

39:08.072 --> 39:10.906
You know what I just realized?
We haven't had
a family dinner in a while.

39:10.908 --> 39:12.165
You up to keep
the party going?

39:12.242 --> 39:13.742
-Yeah.
-I am.

39:13.744 --> 39:15.001

-Wanna cook?

No.

that vegan place

39:20.250 --> 39:21.249
-Hmm, yeah.
-Alice: Oooh.

39:21.251 --> 39:21.858
Where is Malika?

39:28.016 --> 39:30.701
Justine: Your Honor,
the prosecution's request
is outrageous.

39:30.777 --> 39:32.761
This whole case
is an abuse of power

39:32.763 --> 39:36.189
motivated by powerful
elected officials determined
to criminalize Black protest.

39:36.266 --> 39:36.531
Counselor, that's enough.

39:38.118 --> 39:38.825
I'm not going
to revoke bail.

39:40.938 --> 39:43.438
However, considering
Ms. Williams is a member

39:43.440 --> 39:44.773
of an organization
with international reach,

39:44.775 --> 39:45.716
I am going to raise bail

39:47.035 --> 39:49.052
to $250,000.

39:49.129 --> 39:52.280
And until which time
that bail can be paid,

39:52.282 --> 39:53.056
I am remanding
Ms. Williams into custody.
