WEBVTT

00:01.210 --> 00:04.337
And the brads
are not to be used as Q-tips.

00:04.421 --> 00:06.297
They're for holding paper
together.

00:06.382 --> 00:07.924
-Got it?
-Got it? Great.

00:08.008 --> 00:12.887
Oh, and last but least,
"salesman of the month".

00:12.971 --> 00:16.849
Who will take home
the $40 Bass Pro gift card?

00:16.934 --> 00:18.184
Whoo-whoo!

00:18.268 --> 00:20.895
Top gun three months running.

00:20.979 --> 00:23.648
Suck on my big ass numbers, y'all.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.817
You know I'm the champion.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.236
- Yeah.
- Hell yeah.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.738
-Get 'em, boy. Ooh, ooh, ooh!
-Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

00:30.823 --> 00:35.493
Yeah, but see, Adam, corporate listened
to the "characters" you do on your calls.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
-Mmm-hmm.
-And they not only found them offensive,

00:37.788 --> 00:40.581
but they're in breach
of TelAmeriCorp sales policy,

00:40.666 --> 00:43.084
and they had to refund most
of your customers' payments.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.087
So you didn't really win.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.463
-Offensive.
-Mmm-hmm.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.048
On what grounds?

00:49.133 --> 00:51.259
I demand to know this very instance.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.969
I thought you were gonna ask me that.

00:54.138 --> 00:56.389
Excuse me, sir. I am Mufansa.

00:56.473 --> 00:58.349
A thousand blessings on you.

00:58.434 --> 00:59.517
Mufansa, he's very popular.

00:59.601 --> 01:05.231
Oh, so sorry to call so early in the morning,
but would you like to purchase a Crock-Pot?

01:05.315 --> 01:07.233
Mmm-hmm, I call him the sleepy Mexican.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.526
What up, my brother?

01:08.610 --> 01:10.403
This is Jamal, my man.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.739
You want to get down on some solar panels?

01:12.823 --> 01:14.323
I think I used to live next to that guy.

01:14.408 --> 01:17.493
You know what? This some
bull Shih Tzu dookie right here.

01:17.578 --> 01:21.497
Butterball Jones is on the phone
doing fake Apu Simpsons impressions,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.541
and I'm on the phone every day as me.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.585
-You fat phony.
-Fatty.

01:25.669 --> 01:28.629
-I'm not fat.
-Oh, my God. Okay, enough, everybody.

01:28.714 --> 01:32.091
Because Adam vacated his sales,
this month's top gun is Diane.

01:32.176 --> 01:33.509
-Oh.
-Whoa.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.386
Yeah.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.680
Hell, yeah.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.184
Top gun.

01:41.268 --> 01:45.772
Well, I still have the top gun hat,
so it looks like I'm still the top gun.

01:45.856 --> 01:49.066
Yeah, you know what?
And I really do like that hat, Adam.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.444
I like it so much, in fact,
that I made an official

01:51.528 --> 01:53.946
-TelAmeriCorp Top Gun hat.
-Cool.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.115
And this is the only hat
that's allowed to be worn

01:56.200 --> 01:58.743
in the office, actually.
So here you go, Diane.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.953
And, Adam, you can lose
your hat now, please.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.122
-What?
-Lose the hat.

02:03.207 --> 02:04.707
That one's the official one.

02:21.141 --> 02:22.892
I'm fresh

02:23.727 --> 02:25.686
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

02:25.771 --> 02:27.438
Gotta be fresh

02:34.404 --> 02:37.406
Maybe Montez is right.
Maybe Adam DeMamp

02:37.491 --> 02:39.909
is nothing more than a fat dodo
with a fat head,

02:39.993 --> 02:41.744
and just a fat, little body.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.830
I'm like a human baby.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.832
No one would buy anything from me.

02:45.916 --> 02:47.208
Stop it.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.669
Stop talking about my friend
that way, okay?

02:49.753 --> 02:51.337
We're gonna go get
some lunch monkeys.

02:51.421 --> 02:52.839
We're gonna go back
to the office,

02:52.923 --> 02:54.966
and you're gonna go get
that Top Gun hat back.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.718
Adam, stop eating those chips.

02:57.803 --> 02:58.928
-We haven't paid for them yet.
-Hey.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.013
-What?
-This is not good.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.641
We're about to witness
the darkness that is Sadam.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.226
-Sadam Crymamp.
-Yep.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.019
Saddest dude in the whole world, yeah.

03:07.104 --> 03:09.105
I don't want to see that.
But, I mean, it makes sense.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.566
You can't live life that high
without coming down.

03:11.650 --> 03:13.150
But we can't let him crash, okay?

03:13.235 --> 03:14.777
Remember what happened
when Entourage went off the air.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.487
Oh, yeah, I remember.

03:16.572 --> 03:19.073
He didn't shower for, like,
all of Movember or Decembeard.

03:19.157 --> 03:20.783
-Or Manuary.
-It's disgusting.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.869
He said he was bathing himself
in his own tears?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.328
-I know.
-Hey, guys.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.913
You want to come on
a really fun booze cruise?

03:25.998 --> 03:28.958
You mean, like,
the Rancho Land Booze Cruise?

03:29.042 --> 03:32.670
Yep, it's the only booze boat
cruise where the boat is a bus.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.005
- Oh, I love that.
- That's tight.

03:34.089 --> 03:36.674
That sounds way tight, way tight.
Tight like your outfit.

03:36.758 --> 03:38.426
- Yeah.
- Looking good, looking good.

03:38.510 --> 03:40.136
Yes, you are a vision, aren't you?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.847
Speaking of vision,
what happened to your peeper?

03:42.931 --> 03:44.098
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

03:44.182 --> 03:45.850
Oh, you're like a vampire.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.145
I just, just thought it was,
like, part of the, the giddy-up.

03:49.229 --> 03:50.771
-It's not.
-Okay.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.356
Yeah, no, that's, that's obvious now.

03:52.441 --> 03:54.275
Just give me your goddamn names.

03:54.359 --> 03:55.693
What's going on here?

03:55.777 --> 03:58.821
Dude, she's inviting us
to the Rancho Land Booze Cruise.

03:58.906 --> 04:02.867
Makes sense that she would
invite you guys after I had already left.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.577
I'm such a fat idiot.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.621
I'd probably step on board
the Land Booze Cruise

04:06.705 --> 04:08.539
and sink it right
in the concrete.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.083
Oh, right into the concrete.
You hear how funny this guy is?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.418
I'm not funny.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.922
-He's a good guy and single.
-Yeah, way single. No one loves me.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.758
Why don't we put
the reservation in his name?

04:18.842 --> 04:20.009
Yeah, that's a great idea.

04:20.093 --> 04:24.096
So Adam DeMamp, plus two,
and that's, um, "Mamp."

04:24.181 --> 04:26.432
It's just how it sounds. Very American name.

04:26.516 --> 04:28.601
- Mamp. Got it.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.811
- Plus two.
- Yes.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.981
And remember, it's our imperfections
that make us beautiful.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.816
I have a micro-penis.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.320
See you. I don't know.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.406
Probably didn't even spell my name right.
I don't blame her.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.158
What are you talking about?
You're on fire.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.910
Did you see how you just got us
the two bonus seats?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.829
That doesn't just happen, okay?
That's a boss movement, man.

04:48.914 --> 04:50.790
Yeah, that was a real streak-breaker.

04:50.874 --> 04:52.792
So what do you say
we get you back to the office

04:52.876 --> 04:56.212
and get that Top Gun hat back
on that little head, huh?

04:56.922 --> 04:58.673
Whoo.

05:03.762 --> 05:06.806
Hi, I'm Adam DeMamp.

05:06.890 --> 05:09.183
I hope you're ready
to waste a lot of your time

05:09.267 --> 05:10.851
and probably none of your money.

05:10.936 --> 05:14.522
So I'm 30 pounds overweight,
and I suck at life and stuff,

05:14.606 --> 05:17.733
and I was wondering
if you wanted to buy a vacuum.

05:18.193 --> 05:19.443
Just hang up.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.529
No, you hang up.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.739
I'm fat!

05:26.034 --> 05:27.410
I'm so stupid.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.371
- You hang up. You, you hang up.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.373
That was good. That was really good.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.376
Those people were, like, just jerks, probably.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.462
Yeah, not deserving of your time
or many talents, Adam.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.588
Yeah.

05:41.842 --> 05:43.050
You guys are right.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.385
Yeah?

05:44.469 --> 05:47.513
I'll just regroup and get the next one.
You know what I mean?

05:47.848 --> 05:51.225
It's that simple. So if you'll excuse me.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.562
-Staying positive.
-Yes.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.814
Wow, I think he's okay.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.025
Yeah, I'm just glad we're not
dealing with the full-blown

05:59.109 --> 06:00.192
Sadam CryMamp right now.

06:00.277 --> 06:01.861
Yeah, that would be bad,

06:01.945 --> 06:03.362
'cause I am not singing him
to sleep tonight.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.614
Do it, Waymond. Do it. Do it now.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.492
No, no, Adam.

06:08.577 --> 06:09.952
That is company equipment.

06:10.037 --> 06:13.789
I can't get a sale to save my life,
so I might as well kill my stupid life

06:13.874 --> 06:15.207
and freaking bleed
all over the office.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.459
That's what I would do.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.294
But Waymond won't pull
the damn lever, Waymond!

06:18.378 --> 06:21.547
Waymond, do not do that.
Adam, you can't do that, all right?

06:21.631 --> 06:24.008
Also, there's definitely no way that thing
can go through your neck.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.718
Is that a fat joke?
'Cause my neck's too fat?

06:25.802 --> 06:28.387
It is not about a fat neck.
We like your neck, okay?

06:28.472 --> 06:31.182
Now, call Waymond off,
and let's just forget this happened.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.225
Fine. Waymond, let me up.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.227
But I'm not gonna go
on a stupid booze cruise,

06:35.312 --> 06:37.021
'cause that... Ow!

06:37.105 --> 06:38.189
Ow!

06:38.273 --> 06:40.066
You pushed it in my neck.

06:40.317 --> 06:44.195
You freaking little groundhog
of a human being. Stupid.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.863
-Excuse me.
-Are you okay?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.990
-You're a monster.
-What's your problem?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.412
He really filled the hand there.

06:53.497 --> 06:55.706
Yeah, man. Now I know why he was
calling him the groundhog.

06:56.166 --> 06:58.876
We've got to get this guy a sale
to get his confidence back up.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.336
Yeah, how do we do that?

07:01.004 --> 07:03.839
Hey, I heard there's
buttered bread in here?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.592
Is that true?

07:08.220 --> 07:09.887
"Do not open."

07:10.055 --> 07:11.680
More like, "Do open."

07:22.317 --> 07:23.776
Yeah, right.

07:23.860 --> 07:26.529
More like, "For Adam's eyes only."

07:49.469 --> 07:50.469
Hello.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.806
Hello, may I please speak
with a Mr. Blownoff?

07:53.890 --> 07:56.433
This is he,
and you can call me Dick.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.602
Okay, Mr. Blownoff.

07:59.354 --> 08:04.775
I am telling... I am talking to you today
from my work, TelAmeriCorp.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.571
Hey, are you sick of unblended foods?
'Cause it's...

08:08.655 --> 08:10.114
Mmm. You know what?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.741
Never mind. I suck at my job.
And I suck at my life.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.994
-Goodbye forever.
-Hang on.

08:15.078 --> 08:17.788
Listen, son, I don't bite.
What are you selling?

08:17.873 --> 08:19.623
Stupid freaking blenders.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.125
Well, I'll take five.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.418
How 'bout that?

08:22.586 --> 08:23.752
That's cool.

08:24.671 --> 08:27.464
I mean, honestly,
if I'm being real with you,

08:27.549 --> 08:32.386
I wouldn't buy anything from me,
because one, I'm fat. Two, I'm stupid.

08:32.470 --> 08:36.348
-Three, I'm fat and stupid combined.
-Listen, you don't sound fat to me.

08:36.433 --> 08:39.268
Maybe a little depressed, huh?
And I've been there.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.353
-Really?
-You know what I did?

08:41.438 --> 08:44.523
I went on a booze cruise
with my friends,

08:44.608 --> 08:46.358
and I was totally cured.

08:46.443 --> 08:49.862
-Anyway, blenders...
-Well, the blenders...

08:49.946 --> 08:51.614
Actually, I take it back,
what I said earlier.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.616
They're pretty cool.
You can make juices.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.743
You can, like,
blend up a boot.

08:55.827 --> 08:57.870
That's how sharp this thing is.
That's how intense it is.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.538
Oh, I actually have a boot here
right now.

08:59.623 --> 09:00.706
Boop.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.212
Oh, my gosh, the boot,
it's blending so well.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.007
That's funny.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.718
Well, looks like it'll
get to you Tuesday.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.137
And I just want to say thank you.

09:15.972 --> 09:17.765
You are a great man,
Mr. Dick Blownoff.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.893
And you are a good goddamned salesman.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.731
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead
and put you down for two blenders.

09:25.815 --> 09:30.778
That is a kitchen blender
and a basement blender.

09:30.862 --> 09:36.408
Oh, wait, this just came in from upstairs.
That's not $68.99.

09:36.493 --> 09:39.245
It is $49.99.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.830
Can I go ahead and close you
with that number?

09:45.335 --> 09:46.335
Very good.

09:46.670 --> 09:50.714
Selling, selling, selling,
selling, selling, selling.

09:51.341 --> 09:53.676
Dude, I am so pumped for this booze cruise.

09:53.760 --> 09:58.264
I'm a, like, celebrate next
month's future Top Gun victory.

09:58.682 --> 10:02.393
Yes, I'm just excited
to see you happy again. Like, Sadam is dead.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.979
Who's Sadam?

10:05.063 --> 10:08.148
Saddam. Saddam Hussein died.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.692
-Really?
-Yeah, they got him.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.443
-They got him. USA all the way.
-Thank God.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.613
Well, we didn't get him, but those guys
who were out there fighting in the desert.

10:14.698 --> 10:15.948
Freaking SEAL team.
That's cool, man.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.783
At least The Interview
can come out now.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.201
-Totally.
-I've been waiting for that.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.869
- Absolutely.
- It's, like, I'm a Francophile.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.247
-That dude, he's the truth.
-Yeah.

10:23.331 --> 10:26.041
I was thinking, that movie, like,
96 Hours or something like that?

10:26.126 --> 10:28.043
- Yeah.
- What if it was 69 Hours?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.587
--Ah, that would be way funnier.

10:30.672 --> 10:33.382
If it's, like, 69, and he got his dick caught
between the rocks,

10:33.466 --> 10:35.801
and he's like,
does he chew his dick off?

10:35.885 --> 10:37.344
Or he gets his nose caught
in some chick's butt,

10:37.429 --> 10:40.055
and he's like,
"We're 69ing. I need water now!"

10:40.181 --> 10:41.181
We should write pornos.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.183
Yeah, we should write pornos.

10:43.268 --> 10:44.977
Dude, I'm just pumped, all right?

10:45.061 --> 10:46.562
I'm excited for this adventure
we're about to go on,

10:46.646 --> 10:48.147
'cause it has
my favorite things.

10:48.231 --> 10:50.941
Boozes, cruises,
and my dudeses.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.944
I said that I was gonna go.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.863
I didn't say that we were gonna go.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.073
I was actually thinking about
taking my new friend, Dick,

10:58.158 --> 10:59.325
and, like,
one of his buddies.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.410
Dick?
Why would you bring Dick?

11:01.494 --> 11:04.163
Well, who is Dick
is what we really need to know,

11:04.247 --> 11:05.873
'cause we don't know
who that is, Blake.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.334
Yeah, you guys don't know Dick.
He... He, like...

11:08.752 --> 11:10.919
He was my first sale of the day,
and he kind of took me out

11:11.004 --> 11:12.338
-of my sales slump.
-Oh.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.923
And we just sort of bro bonded
in, like, like a real

11:15.008 --> 11:17.343
-and, like, authentic way.
-Okay.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.220
It's like we have two Avatar tails,
and they just intertwined.

11:20.305 --> 11:21.638
It's just...

11:21.723 --> 11:24.558
Is it weird to bring a guy
that you've never met to a party?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.894
- I mean, like, I'm not...
- Yeah, that sucks.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.395
You know, right?

11:28.480 --> 11:30.022
Oh, okay, yup.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.649
-Yes, you are correct.
-Right?

11:32.734 --> 11:36.195
I should meet him and hang out with him first
before I invite him on the booze cruise.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.365
-That is a good call, Ders.
-That's not what I'm, uh...

11:39.449 --> 11:40.949
Thank you, Ders.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.246
-Hey, dudes, what's up?
-Hey.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.374
So you guys need a pro actor
to trick Adam, huh?

11:48.458 --> 11:51.043
Okay. Well, you're in luck.
This is a client of mine, Ryan Gall.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.169
Hello.

11:52.253 --> 11:56.924
Ryan here has ran up a pretty hefty tab
over the past couple years in weed,

11:57.008 --> 11:58.926
so he's gonna pay you guys
in acting dollars.

11:59.010 --> 12:00.469
Isn't that right, Ry?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.221
-Isn't that right?
-Yeah, that's...

12:02.305 --> 12:03.347
-You're gonna pay them, huh?
-Yes.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.349
-You're gonna act for them?
-I will. I will.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.851
Okay, Ryan knows everything that's going on.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.270
Uh, he's a Groundling. He can improv.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.564
If you need me,
I'm gonna be at Burger King.

12:12.649 --> 12:15.609
I got a dude that gives me free refills,
and I am freaking pumped about that.

12:15.693 --> 12:16.693
See you, Ryan.

12:16.778 --> 12:18.404
-Where are you going?
-Act good.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.407
-You said it would be a half hour.
-You're with them, Ryan.

12:23.827 --> 12:26.537
Well, well, well.
We're in the midst of a real actor.

12:26.621 --> 12:29.498
Great, great. So what's this
groundhogs thing

12:29.582 --> 12:30.916
he's talking about, huh?

12:31.000 --> 12:35.254
Uh, it's the Groundlings,
and we do improv comedy.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.797
It's kind of like Whose Line,
a lot of, "Yes, and..."

12:36.881 --> 12:40.217
-All right, save it.
-Yes, and what the hell's Whose Line?

12:40.301 --> 12:42.636
Oh, it's like Wild 'N Out.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.805
Oh, okay, well, here's a tip.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.306
Lead with that, you know?

12:46.391 --> 12:48.892
Just drop Affion Crockett,
and people will be with you.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.103
-Now we're on board.
-Have we seen you in anything?

12:51.187 --> 12:52.563
I've been in some commercials.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.231
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.191
Oh, he's that Captain Obvious guy.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.401
-That's not me.
-Oh.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.652
- No?
- No.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.778
-Okay.
-I know who he is.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.530
Dude, you're one of the two Sonic guys.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.157
-Oh, yeah.
-We watch you all the time.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.159
-Yeah, the drive-thru.
-I'm not... That's not me.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.452
I thought you were in commercials, man.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.911
What the heck?
Do you even know Flo?

13:08.079 --> 13:11.165
No, look, I am a serious actor, okay?

13:11.249 --> 13:13.083
I trained under the Jim Rash.

13:13.168 --> 13:18.338
Oh, so a fellow thespian.
I actually did some theater acting in college.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.591
I played the role of Puck.

13:20.675 --> 13:22.676
No kidding? Midsummer's Night Dream?

13:22.760 --> 13:26.430
No, no, actually, it was a stage adaptation
of Real World: San Francisco.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.515
-I played Puck.
-Yeah.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.476
The peanut butter scene
was riveting.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.145
Here's your information
for Mr. Blownoff.

13:33.229 --> 13:37.232
Basically, he's the exact opposite of Adam,
because we need him to just hate you.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.860
I can play the heel, no problem.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.196
It's basically what I did
on 10 Items or Less.

13:42.489 --> 13:44.198
You were on 10 Items or Less?

13:44.282 --> 13:45.532
-Yeah.
-Dude!

13:45.617 --> 13:48.577
-That show had the best commercials.
-It did.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.758
Welcome to the VIP chill room.

14:03.426 --> 14:07.554
Hey, you know, your voice sounds
a little different than it did on the phone.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.223
- It does?
- Yeah.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.225
Uh... Oh, you know what?

14:11.309 --> 14:15.437
When we talked on the phone,
I think I had, like, a cold/flu or something.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.356
Got some lunch monkeys
for my buddy.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.691
Oh, you know what?
I don't touch the stuff.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.443
Yeah, sober 15 years.

14:22.237 --> 14:25.697
Wow, I didn't even know
that was a thing you could do.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.824
-Mmm-hmm.
-No beer poops.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.159
That's smart.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.869
Hey, there you are.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.079
-Hidey-ho, neighbor.
-Oh, hey.

14:32.163 --> 14:34.081
These are my work friends,
Ders and Blake.

14:34.457 --> 14:38.085
And this is my very, very,
very good buddy, Dick Blownoff.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.711
Oh, cool, very cool, very cool.

14:39.796 --> 14:41.213
-What's up?
-He's a cool guy.

14:41.297 --> 14:42.631
What were we in here for?

14:42.799 --> 14:47.928
Oh, yes. We were just talking
about huge bazoingas, and...

14:48.012 --> 14:51.723
Well, shoot, man, Dick,
what do you think about those?

14:51.808 --> 14:54.726
Uh... Big breasts are stupid.

14:54.978 --> 14:59.565
Yeah, I like little, tiny,
like, mosquito bite-style boobs.

15:00.149 --> 15:01.275
You know what?

15:03.319 --> 15:04.653
I get that.

15:04.946 --> 15:07.573
Yeah, because if the bazoinga
is too big

15:07.657 --> 15:09.408
and you try to fit it all
in your mouth,

15:09.492 --> 15:10.867
there's too much meat there, right?

15:10.952 --> 15:15.247
And your jaw might pop out of place,
and then you can't eat dinner.

15:15.331 --> 15:19.084
Yes, and treating women
like human beings

15:19.168 --> 15:22.963
and not just sex objects,
that's what I'm all about.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.424
-Okay, well, that's crazy.
-Yeah.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.844
-I mean, what?
-What planet are you from?

15:28.928 --> 15:30.804
And make sure Adam doesn't
visit there, 'cause that's, like,

15:30.888 --> 15:32.764
-the opposite of stuff he likes.
-Yeah.

15:32.849 --> 15:36.101
No, he's actually
the exact opposite of opposite,

15:36.185 --> 15:39.229
which is, like...
It's, like, the same.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.939
-Dick?
-Uh-huh?

15:41.024 --> 15:43.358
Will you be my very best friend

15:43.443 --> 15:45.152
and come with me
to the Land Booze Cruise?

15:45.528 --> 15:49.281
Oh, yeah... Oh, I have work.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.074
-Mmm.
-Mmm, damn it.

15:51.159 --> 15:56.788
And I am always on call,
because I am a CIA spy.

15:56.873 --> 15:58.373
No way.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.334
-Um, I didn't think that you could be.
-Yes, I am.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.503
When I saw you,
I thought you'd be a CPA.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.381
I knew it, dude.
I knew something was going on.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.467
-Yeah?
-Something was a little off about you.

16:08.551 --> 16:10.385
-That's me, yeah.
-Oh, there's layers.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.471
I'm freaking peeling them back,
and there's a freaking cool,

16:12.555 --> 16:14.389
undercover spy beneath.

16:15.266 --> 16:18.852
Do me the honor of going with me
on the Land Booze Cruise, please.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.562
-No, don't do this.
-Please, go with me.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.105
I'll hold my breath until you say yes.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.274
-Just say yes, please.
-Don't hold your breath.

16:24.609 --> 16:25.609
Say yes.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.069
-I can't.
-Please, this hurts.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.072
- Okay, yes. Yes, yes.

16:30.573 --> 16:31.823
Bye, new friend.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.367
-Okay.
-Bye.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.451
Uh-huh.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.663
What the hell was that?
You were supposed to say no.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.831
Yeah, I was gonna,
but then I remembered

16:39.916 --> 16:42.501
what my Oscar-winning teacher,
Jim Rash, once said.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.544
Okay, fuck Jim Rash, all right?

16:44.629 --> 16:45.837
I'll give you a rash.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.339
Okay, you know what?

16:47.423 --> 16:50.425
I might have had a breakfast
edible, and it kind of...

16:50.510 --> 16:52.260
I'm sorry. You're high right now?

16:52.345 --> 16:54.346
Yes, I'm a little bit, I'm...

16:54.430 --> 16:56.223
That all makes sense now.
That's why we're getting

16:56.307 --> 16:58.684
hour-long Showtime show,
basic cable acting from you,

16:58.768 --> 17:00.352
when what we're asking for

17:00.436 --> 17:02.729
is Super Bowl commercial
quality acting from you, Ryan.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.439
We're not getting it.
We need it. You're screwing us.

17:04.524 --> 17:07.442
No, the edibles, they help my craft,
and they help my process.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.944
I need them for my craft and process.

17:09.028 --> 17:13.448
All right, Mr. Craft,
Mr. Macaroni, process this.

17:13.533 --> 17:17.744
What if I told you we could give you
the biggest role in the biggest blockbuster

17:17.829 --> 17:18.954
of all time?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.664
-Okay.
-Your life.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.208
-Okay.
-Hmm?

17:23.292 --> 17:24.751
What are you talking about?

17:24.836 --> 17:26.586
I don't... Look, can you just
keep playing the character Dick

17:26.671 --> 17:29.798
for a little longer and actually do
what me and Ders tell you to do?

17:29.966 --> 17:31.591
Okay, I'm listening.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.845
Only because I owe Karl
crap loads of money, so...

17:35.638 --> 17:38.390
Honestly, dude,
you're, like, 100% right.

17:38.474 --> 17:41.059
Because I was looking
at some small-chested pornog,

17:41.144 --> 17:43.603
and Riley Reed made me realize
that I've been ignoring the butt.

17:43.688 --> 17:44.688
-Yes.
-Right.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.649
And the butt's the most erogenous area
on the woman's...

17:48.401 --> 17:49.860
I mean, I don't mind if someone's playing...

17:49.944 --> 17:51.695
Oh, God, they're on to me.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.822
-What?
-No, no, run!

17:53.906 --> 17:56.241
Agent Blownoff,
you're coming with us.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.660
Save yourself,
and make sure that you take

17:58.745 --> 18:01.830
your friends, Blake and Ders,
on this Land Booze Cruise.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.916
No, I'll save you!

18:10.089 --> 18:11.214
-Yes!
-Oh, my God. We did it.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.467
- We did it.
- We did it.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.385
-You were amazing, man.
-Thank you.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.429
And I mean this when I say
that you could be in those,

18:17.513 --> 18:19.723
like, hella dramatic commercials
where they try and get people

18:19.807 --> 18:21.057
to adopt dogs
before they murder them.

18:21.142 --> 18:22.768
Or even, like,
the hella way dramatic

18:22.852 --> 18:24.811
new Life Alert commercials.
Have you seen those?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.104
Oh, my God, heart breaker.

18:26.189 --> 18:27.939
We should get those
for our grandmas, 'cause, like,

18:28.024 --> 18:30.442
what if she does fall down,
and, like, she can't get up?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.194
I don't want that to happen to Ferianne.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.321
-She's a beautiful woman.
-Yeah, she is really pretty.

18:34.405 --> 18:35.447
My grandma's hot.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.824
All right, let's circle back
to join Adam for this booze cruise, huh?

18:37.909 --> 18:39.659
-Yeah, baby. I love it.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.288
Oh!

18:43.414 --> 18:44.956
-Oh, my God.
-Is he okay?

18:45.041 --> 18:47.542
Ow! Whoo-hoo! Oh, gosh.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.469
-Oh, my God.
-Are you all right?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.471
- Are you okay?
- How did I do that?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.640
- Yeah, that was amazing.
- That was insane.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.850
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

19:03.935 --> 19:07.062
I don't know.
I'm, like, 100%. I'm 100% okay.

19:07.688 --> 19:11.066
Wait, what are you guys...
Did you guys get kidnapped, too?

19:11.400 --> 19:12.651
Are you a double agent?

19:12.735 --> 19:13.985
Who do you work for?

19:14.070 --> 19:18.198
Adam, there's no Dick Blownoff.
Actually, I'm Dick Blownoff.

19:18.908 --> 19:21.117
- You said, "Dick blown off."
Yeah.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.702
Oh, I've been saying that.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.871
-That's funny.
-Yeah, we thought of it.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.374
Yeah, well,
Ders made up that character,

19:27.458 --> 19:29.459
because we were trying
to get you out of your slump.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.711
I mean, you were so depressed,
and we want to party with you, man.

19:31.796 --> 19:33.296
We want to go on this booze cruise.

19:33.381 --> 19:34.756
Then who's this guy?

19:35.341 --> 19:36.800
Well, this is Ryan Gall.

19:36.884 --> 19:39.719
He's an "actor" that we hired from Karl.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.513
- Yeah, more like hack-tor.
- Yeah.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.889
--That's funny.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.892
You're an actor. So you know Flo from
the Progressive commercials?

19:45.977 --> 19:47.185
No, not personally.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.728
Okay, this guy's not really an actor.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.647
Hey, Karl, we square?

19:50.731 --> 19:51.773
Hell, yeah, man. We're good.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.525
Okay, can I get a little weed?

19:53.609 --> 19:54.860
Oh, for sheezy, bro.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.653
- What do you need?
- Halfer?

19:56.737 --> 19:57.863
- Half pound?
- Yeah, I need it.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.573
Half LB of the green, coming right up, man.
In the van, okay?

19:59.657 --> 20:01.700
- Let's do it.
- I'm gonna pray for you man.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.618
Stay high. Stay lifted.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.203
I knew he wasn't a spy.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.539
'Cause spies love huge bazoingas.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.667
That's, like, a rule when you become
an international man of mystery.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.461
Thank you guys for lying to me
to make me feel better.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.839
That's... That's really cool.

20:16.257 --> 20:18.008
Hey, for you, man, any time.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.676
You know what?

20:19.760 --> 20:24.723
I hope you guys are ready
and prepare your brains

20:24.807 --> 20:30.729
to party on Rancho Cucamunga's
only Land Booze Cruise!

20:31.188 --> 20:33.023
Whoo!

20:33.316 --> 20:35.400
Yeah, boy! Oh, God.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.069
- I am a little injured.
- Yeah.

20:38.154 --> 20:40.071
Yeah, I didn't notice that right away.
That is...

20:40.156 --> 20:41.573
Ah, it's starting to burn.

20:41.657 --> 20:42.991
- Yeah, blow on it.
- Look for my palm.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.787
Man, this... I am having fun right now.

20:48.581 --> 20:49.789
Total blast.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.795
A lot of dudes.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.772
Okay, Diane, can you please?
This is a meeting.

21:13.856 --> 21:15.148
Can you sit down?
