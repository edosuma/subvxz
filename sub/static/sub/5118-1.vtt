when you can't
sleep at night? 

00:19.069 --> 00:22.204
do you hold your breath?
Do you count back from 10? 

00:22.238 --> 00:24.973
do you cry? Do you count?
Do you cry?

have you had breakfast?

00:31.815 --> 00:33.916
- No, I'm not hungry.
- Not acceptable!

The latest public relations
crisis is today.

do you wake up blue or
do you just sleep it off... 

01:09.886 --> 01:11.253
Who are you
calling a brat?

01:11.287 --> 01:12.855
- Private!

01:12.889 --> 01:15.023
- What you do online
isn't exactly private.

01:15.058 --> 01:18.026
Oh! I almost forgot.

01:18.061 --> 01:20.129
It's your birthday!

01:20.163 --> 01:22.264
- Mmm! Don't forget
to get me a present!

01:22.298 --> 01:25.067
- I'm gonna tie a string
around my finger.

01:25.101 --> 01:26.068
- Good.

01:26.102 --> 01:27.136

Don't you dare
miss your bus again!

01:29.172 --> 01:31.874

hey, do you like to
chit chat, chit chat 

01:34.878 --> 01:37.946

do you try and explain

01:41.017 --> 01:43.118
Hey, did you see my bag?
I need my bag.

01:43.153 --> 01:44.953
(whistling)

01:44.988 --> 01:48.023
- What you need
is a brain.

01:48.057 --> 01:51.160
You can't hit me
on my birthday!

01:51.194 --> 01:53.896

01:53.930 --> 01:56.899
Why does everybody think
I should have a party?

01:56.933 --> 01:58.867
Turning 17 doesn't
mean anything.

01:58.902 --> 02:01.837
- You're crazy. A party means
presents, money, bling.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.773
- If your dad left 3 months ago,
you wouldn't want a party.

02:04.808 --> 02:06.842
- I don't care about that.

02:06.876 --> 02:10.112
- We should do what you did
for your 11th birthday party.

02:10.145 --> 02:11.814
- We just got our nails done.

02:11.848 --> 02:13.215
The smell was so bad,
we all got sick.

02:13.249 --> 02:15.117
I'm pretty sure
julie bryson threw up.

02:15.151 --> 02:17.886
- Did you hear julie's pregnant?

02:17.921 --> 02:20.789
- What? How would you know?
She moved to florida.

02:20.824 --> 02:22.224
- Clicksters. Hello!

02:22.258 --> 02:24.026
- Oh yeah, of course.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.828
...You were upset.

02:25.862 --> 02:28.063
chit chat, chit chat
chit chat, chit chat 

02:28.097 --> 02:31.133
What did you say in health
that got lindsay so pissed off?

02:31.167 --> 02:34.102
- Nothing! I just said it's
better to wait until you're 18

02:34.137 --> 02:35.237
Before you go all the way.

02:35.271 --> 02:37.206
- She's been doing it
since 9th grade.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.041
- You basically
called her a slut.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.209
- Yeah!
- I did not!

02:40.243 --> 02:43.779
It was a class discussion.
I wasn't talking about her.

02:43.813 --> 02:45.214
- My brother wears
shoes like that.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.748
He's 10.

02:46.783 --> 02:47.783
(all laughing)

02:47.817 --> 02:49.818
- Don't you love high school?
- So great.

02:49.853 --> 02:50.986
- Best years
of our lives.

02:51.020 --> 02:52.054
- Wonderful.
- Amazing.

02:52.088 --> 02:54.790
Uh, definition
of "contrarian"?

02:54.824 --> 02:56.925
- Me. Definition
of "lazy": You.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.227
Do your
own homework.

02:58.261 --> 02:59.895
- Look at you!

02:59.929 --> 03:02.097
Taylor, you're a "brainiac".
You should know.

03:03.833 --> 03:05.100
Let's have it.

03:07.804 --> 03:09.838
Oh, the definition of "lust".

03:09.873 --> 03:12.774
- When I look at him,
my throat swells up.

03:12.809 --> 03:15.777
- You do know that scott
is just a dumb jock, right?

03:15.812 --> 03:17.179
- No, he's not!
- Ok!

03:17.213 --> 03:19.047
If you were on clicksters,

03:19.082 --> 03:20.883
You could send him
a hot metre quiz

03:20.917 --> 03:22.084
And find out if he likes you.

03:22.118 --> 03:23.919
- Stop!
That is so 6th grade.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.921
Even if I wanted to,
I couldn't.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.223
My mom stands over
my shoulder the whole time.

03:28.258 --> 03:30.225
She has computer-
monitoring software.

03:30.260 --> 03:32.794
She goes on all
the sites I've been on.

03:32.829 --> 03:34.096
There's no way.
See you later.

03:34.130 --> 03:35.097
- Bye.

03:35.131 --> 03:36.965
- Bye. Her mom
is so backwards.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.001
She can't even have
internet on her phone.

03:39.035 --> 03:41.103
- Ah! How does
she live?

03:41.137 --> 03:45.007
- On this day in history, the
great bard, william shakespeare,

03:45.041 --> 03:48.777
Took his first breath in 1564.

03:48.811 --> 03:53.015
The very first motion picture
was shown in 1896.

03:53.049 --> 03:57.886
Theodore roosevelt delivered
his man in the arena speech

03:57.921 --> 03:59.054
In 1910.

03:59.088 --> 04:00.789
Also on this day in history,

04:00.823 --> 04:02.090
Just a little closer to home,

04:02.125 --> 04:04.092
Taylor hillridge was born.

04:04.127 --> 04:05.827
Happy birthday, taylor.

04:05.862 --> 04:07.162
(students murmuring)

04:07.196 --> 04:08.964
- Happy birthday.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.198
- Thanks.

04:14.203 --> 04:16.171
- Today's my dad's
birthday too.

04:16.204 --> 04:18.072
- Cool.

04:18.107 --> 04:19.908
- All right, class,

04:19.942 --> 04:24.780
If you would open your books
to unit 11, page 773,

04:24.814 --> 04:27.249
We'll look at
a turbulent time.

04:27.283 --> 04:29.851
- I swear, when
he touched my shoulder,

04:29.886 --> 04:31.119
There was,
like, electricity.

04:31.154 --> 04:32.120
- Oh, please.

04:32.155 --> 04:34.089
- No, I'm serious!
I felt a tingle.

04:34.123 --> 04:36.124
You think he'd ask me
to the spring fling?

04:36.159 --> 04:38.794
- No!
- Why?

04:38.828 --> 04:40.896
- Scott ozsik is not
the romantic type.

04:40.930 --> 04:43.832
He's a basketball player
on the same team as charlie.

04:43.866 --> 04:44.833
(scoffing)

04:44.867 --> 04:46.101
- Ok, he's not
like charlie.

04:46.135 --> 04:48.170
- He is exactly
like charlie.

04:48.204 --> 04:50.839
And I would know,
because I hung out with them.

04:50.873 --> 04:51.907
- Yeah, once.

04:51.941 --> 04:53.909
- Yeah. Charlie hooked
up with me,

04:53.943 --> 04:55.077
He got what he wanted,

04:55.111 --> 04:57.112
And he never spoke
to me ever again.

04:58.181 --> 05:01.750
- I know. I'm sorry.
I know how much that sucked.

05:01.784 --> 05:02.818
(sighing)

05:02.852 --> 05:04.052
(girls giggling)

05:04.087 --> 05:05.187
He's not like charlie.

05:05.221 --> 05:07.856
- He is exactly
like charlie.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.058
And it's stupid for you
to lose your head

05:10.093 --> 05:12.027
Over something
silly like this.

05:13.162 --> 05:15.130
Remember, it was your
dad who left you guys

05:15.164 --> 05:16.798
For a 25-year-old girl.

05:16.833 --> 05:18.900
If that doesn't tell you
how scummy guys are--

05:18.935 --> 05:20.902
- Hey, leave my dad
out of it, ok?

05:20.937 --> 05:22.137
- (girl):
It's so late.

05:24.974 --> 05:26.141
- Thank you.

05:30.113 --> 05:31.146
- My own computer?

05:31.180 --> 05:32.848
- Aw, lucky!

05:32.882 --> 05:34.182
- Wait, hang on.

05:34.217 --> 05:36.852
No, there has to be
a catch, like, uh...

05:36.886 --> 05:38.787
I can only use it
in the kitchen,

05:38.821 --> 05:40.022
I can't use it
after 1:00.

05:40.056 --> 05:41.957
- Or you have to
share it with me.

05:41.991 --> 05:43.925
- No, stop.
There's no catch.

05:43.960 --> 05:45.761
It's all yours, private.

05:45.795 --> 05:48.196
You can use it wherever
you want if you follow my rules.

05:48.231 --> 05:52.100
No inappropriate sites and no
giving out personal information.

05:52.135 --> 05:55.203
- I know the rules, but you're
trusting me? Are you feeling ok?

05:55.238 --> 05:57.939
- You're funny. I know you think
I'm overprotective,

05:57.974 --> 06:00.876
But the word is "responsible".
- Try "suffocating".

06:00.910 --> 06:02.110
- I'll let that one slide.

06:02.145 --> 06:03.945
You wanna be
a journalist

06:03.980 --> 06:06.748
And I want you to write
to your heart's content.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.850
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

06:08.885 --> 06:09.918
I'm gonna
go hook it up.

06:09.952 --> 06:10.952
- I'll come help!

06:10.987 --> 06:12.921
- You touch, you die.

06:16.025 --> 06:18.994
- Do you know if your father
called taylor today?

06:19.028 --> 06:20.796
- Don't think so.

06:20.830 --> 06:23.832
She told him she didn't want to
speak to him ever again, so...

06:25.101 --> 06:26.201
(chuckling)

06:26.235 --> 06:27.836
- Ok.

06:27.870 --> 06:29.838
What is my
favourite body part?

06:29.872 --> 06:32.040
I have to answer these
questions on my profile?

06:32.075 --> 06:34.176
- Just say "eyes".
Everybody says "eyes".

06:34.210 --> 06:36.244
- I said "butt".
- You can get away with it.

06:36.279 --> 06:38.914
Everybody knows you are
all talk and no action.

06:38.948 --> 06:39.948
- I'm putting "eyes".

06:39.982 --> 06:41.950
- Shut up!
- Ah!

06:41.984 --> 06:44.953
- Hang on. What kind of
underwear am I wearing now?

06:44.987 --> 06:46.955
Oh my god!
- Just say "pink".

06:46.989 --> 06:49.091
Everybody says "pink".
- I said "black".

06:49.125 --> 06:51.827
- You don't own black underwear!
- Black?

06:51.861 --> 06:54.763
Seriously, what's the point of
answering these questions

06:54.797 --> 06:55.897
If they're all untrue?

06:55.932 --> 06:58.767
- Fine! Tell everybody about
your virginal white undies.

06:58.801 --> 06:59.935
- They're not all white!

06:59.969 --> 07:02.771
- You're not gonna get
cute guys talking to you.

07:02.805 --> 07:05.841
You'd be surprised how many guys
ask me about my black underwear.

07:05.875 --> 07:07.008
- What?
- Now do you get it?

07:07.043 --> 07:08.810
- Ok, all right.
- It makes sense?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.912
- But I'm not putting "black".
- Or "white".

07:10.947 --> 07:13.181
- I'll put "blue".
I'll put "blue". That's good.

07:13.216 --> 07:15.150
(beeping)

07:15.184 --> 07:17.185
- What was that?
It just beeped.

07:17.220 --> 07:19.020
- Friend request.
Click there.

07:19.055 --> 07:20.856
- Ok... Oh!

07:20.890 --> 07:21.923
- Ooh!
- It's scott.

07:21.958 --> 07:23.925
- Ok, now when you
post your answer,

07:23.960 --> 07:26.094
He'll be picturing you
in your underwear.

07:26.129 --> 07:28.096
(beeping)

07:28.131 --> 07:30.799
- I'm friends
with scott!

07:30.833 --> 07:32.801
- Whoo!

- Hello?

07:57.927 --> 07:59.828
Yeah, thanks for calling.

07:59.862 --> 08:02.197
Listen, I'm looking
over the numbers

08:02.231 --> 08:05.000
And what you gave me
on line 56...

08:11.908 --> 08:13.775
(chuckles)

08:15.111 --> 08:16.912
- Aw!

08:30.860 --> 08:31.893
- Hey!

08:31.928 --> 08:33.962
- Lindsay commented
on our photo.

08:33.996 --> 08:35.830
- Oh, lindsay!

08:36.866 --> 08:38.066
Hang on.

08:42.738 --> 08:43.871
(scoffing)

08:43.905 --> 08:45.774
Oh, that's not very nice.

08:45.808 --> 08:48.877
I don't even know which one
I'm supposed to be,

08:48.911 --> 08:49.945
Lardo or dogface.

08:49.979 --> 08:51.146
- I guess I'll be dogface.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.881
- What if I wanna be dogface?

08:52.915 --> 08:54.816
- Well, fine.
Then I'm lardo.

08:54.850 --> 08:56.952
I could always lose
a little bit of weight.

08:56.986 --> 08:59.120
You, however, will always
look like a dog.

08:59.155 --> 09:00.956
(chuckles, barks)

09:03.059 --> 09:04.893
(birds chirping)

09:07.029 --> 09:09.231
(school bell ringing)

09:14.770 --> 09:15.937
- Thanks.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.873
- Maybe it was
a freudian slip.

09:20.009 --> 09:22.043
You know, maybe you
don't like history,

09:22.078 --> 09:24.045
So you accidently
dropped your book.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.046
Get it?

09:25.081 --> 09:26.881
- I don't know.
I like history.

09:26.916 --> 09:27.882
- Oh, me too.

09:27.917 --> 09:28.883
- Oh!

09:28.918 --> 09:30.919
- It's my favourite.

09:34.190 --> 09:36.091
- Caleb's kind of
a weird dude, huh?

09:36.125 --> 09:37.726
- Yeah, a little bit.

09:37.760 --> 09:38.727
(chuckling)

09:38.761 --> 09:40.862
- So I saw you're on
clicksters now.

09:40.896 --> 09:43.031
I like it better
than facebook. A lot more raw.

09:43.065 --> 09:45.066
- Yeah, I noticed.

09:45.101 --> 09:47.135
- So maybe I'll talk
to you on there tonight?

09:47.169 --> 09:50.071
- Uh, yeah. You mean, like,
instant message or something?

09:50.106 --> 09:52.974
- There's actually a chat
room just for the school.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.110
I hang out there
sometimes when I'm bored.

09:55.144 --> 09:57.779
People talk trash.
It's kind of funny, so...

09:57.813 --> 09:59.014
- Ha! Ok, I'll look for it.

09:59.048 --> 10:00.181
- Cool.
- Ok.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.820
(beeping)

10:12.795 --> 10:17.198
walking down the road
to my imaginary shelter 

10:17.233 --> 10:19.801
anytime my sky falls 

10:19.835 --> 10:22.037
no one but me can enter 

10:22.071 --> 10:24.139
it's a downhill walk 

10:24.173 --> 10:27.742
it's full of thorns
and nettles 

10:27.777 --> 10:29.878
Oh, what? Now I'm a loser?

10:29.912 --> 10:33.948
the more I March
the less I trust 

10:33.983 --> 10:37.152
come take away my darkness 

10:37.186 --> 10:39.788
come take away my pain 

10:39.822 --> 10:41.056
That's true.

10:41.090 --> 10:42.924
break this
light-proof circle 

10:42.958 --> 10:44.059
(scoffing)

10:44.093 --> 10:46.061
and wash away my stains 

10:46.095 --> 10:48.930
'cause out of my world
I'm quite fragile... 

10:48.964 --> 10:50.065
- What?

10:50.099 --> 10:51.199
- Is that clicksters?

10:51.233 --> 10:53.168
Can you make me
an account?

10:53.202 --> 10:54.169
- No!

10:54.203 --> 10:55.904
- Please, just don't-- why?

10:55.938 --> 10:58.073
- No! Get out of my room,
you little worm! Go!

10:58.107 --> 10:59.074
- Aw! I hate you!

10:59.108 --> 11:00.875
I'm quite fragile 

11:00.910 --> 11:02.143
(beeping)

11:03.179 --> 11:05.213
- It has been decided.
I am officially lardo.

11:05.247 --> 11:06.214
- Ah!

11:06.248 --> 11:07.248
- Ah.

11:07.283 --> 11:09.851
- Thanks to the queen
of mountain high school.

11:09.885 --> 11:11.953
- Why does she call herself
lindsayluv online?

11:11.987 --> 11:13.054
It's a contradiction.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.990
- (cheyenne): Does she have
bionic hearing or what?

11:16.025 --> 11:17.225
- Oh!

11:17.259 --> 11:18.226
- Jeez!

11:18.260 --> 11:19.961
Oh! Sorry!

11:19.995 --> 11:20.962
- Oh!

11:20.996 --> 11:22.030
Taylor, hey.

11:23.165 --> 11:26.067
Um, I was actually reading
your page last night, and...

11:26.102 --> 11:27.068
- Oh!

11:27.103 --> 11:28.837
- You're a really
good writer.

11:28.871 --> 11:29.904
- Oh! Well,
thank you.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.040
- But I do think you
need a few more pictures.

11:32.074 --> 11:33.875
Maybe a bikini shot
or something.

11:33.909 --> 11:34.876
(both chuckling)

11:34.910 --> 11:36.044
- Ok, I'll think
about it.

11:36.078 --> 11:37.045
(chuckling)

11:37.079 --> 11:38.012
- See you later.

11:38.047 --> 11:39.047
- Bye.

11:41.250 --> 11:43.118
- A bikini shot? Come on!

11:43.152 --> 11:45.086
- He was joking!
- You are so naive!

11:45.121 --> 11:46.888
I can think of
at least 2 girls

11:46.922 --> 11:48.890
He's hooked up with
in the past month.

11:48.924 --> 11:52.060
- If you count just kissing,
then I can think of 3 girls.

11:52.094 --> 11:53.995
- Whatever, he's popular!

11:54.029 --> 11:56.965
Wait, hang on. Don't turn.
Drop me off first.

11:56.999 --> 11:59.968
- Why? We always go
to the mall on Friday.

12:00.002 --> 12:02.771
- I wanna go home and see
if scott goes online.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.006
- Ok, you're now
officially pathetic.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.242
- I think it's cute.
Let her be in love.

12:07.276 --> 12:08.943
- It's not love!

12:08.978 --> 12:11.012
I'm sorry, but waiting
for a guy to type:

12:11.046 --> 12:13.148
"hey, baby.
Send me a bikini shot,"

12:13.182 --> 12:14.182
Is not love!

12:14.216 --> 12:16.184
- Then what is?
Sleeping with a guy

12:16.218 --> 12:17.986
The 2nd time you guys go out

12:18.020 --> 12:20.989
And then wondering why he never
talks to you again?

12:21.023 --> 12:24.025
if you wanna make me stay
you'll see... 

12:24.059 --> 12:25.994
- Get out.

12:26.028 --> 12:27.262
- What?

12:27.296 --> 12:29.264
- You can't be serious?
- Out.

12:29.298 --> 12:30.932
(scoffing)

12:30.966 --> 12:32.901
all you ever did 

12:32.935 --> 12:34.202
was care for me 

12:34.236 --> 12:37.272
it's all the same
I'll be walking away 

12:37.306 --> 12:39.908
but you'll forget me 

12:39.942 --> 12:42.143
all I want... 

12:42.178 --> 12:44.045
-    Samantha gets so intense.

12:44.079 --> 12:45.914
- Yeah, I know.
It's fine.

12:45.948 --> 12:47.749
She'll be all right tomorrow.

12:47.783 --> 12:49.117
Besides it was
totally worth it.

12:49.151 --> 12:51.219
Scott talked to me for,
like, half an hour.

12:51.253 --> 12:54.088
He sent me 13 messages.

12:54.123 --> 12:56.057
- Wow! You think
he likes you?

12:56.091 --> 12:57.859
- I don't know.
Probably not.

12:57.893 --> 12:59.828
I know he talks
to a lot of girls.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.996
Oh, hang on.
Maybe this is him.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.998
(grunts)

13:05.000 --> 13:06.134
(beep)

13:06.168 --> 13:08.036
- Huh! No, it's a friend request

13:08.070 --> 13:10.004
From some guy named james.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.841
Whoa, cheyenne, this guy's,
like, totally gorgeous.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.877
Says he's 17 and
he goes to ridgeway.

13:15.911 --> 13:17.111
- Oh, my cousin goes there.

13:17.146 --> 13:18.813
- Whoa, listen to this.

13:23.919 --> 13:26.221
"heard its voice in my soul
just like you said.

13:26.255 --> 13:28.156
"made me wonder
if talking to you

13:28.190 --> 13:30.091
"would be the same
kind of thing."

13:30.125 --> 13:31.159
- So he has a brain.

13:31.193 --> 13:32.861
-    Yeah, and a soul!

13:32.895 --> 13:33.995
(laughing)

13:35.197 --> 13:36.865
Should I write him back?

13:36.899 --> 13:39.100
- Um, if you don't,
I will.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.969
(sighing)

13:43.873 --> 13:45.874
(dishes clinking)

13:45.908 --> 13:47.876
- Eric, it's your turn.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.844
What you learn today?

13:51.080 --> 13:52.046
- Stuff.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.915
- Like?

13:54.917 --> 13:56.017
- Dad's in
california.

13:56.051 --> 13:57.218
- You talked to him?

13:57.253 --> 13:58.887
- Yeah, he called me.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.955
- Maybe he called me.

14:08.230 --> 14:10.164
(beeping)

14:21.010 --> 14:22.977
(sniffling)

14:25.915 --> 14:26.881
- What is it?

14:26.916 --> 14:28.950
- Look! Somebody figured
out my password

14:28.984 --> 14:30.151
And they hacked
my profile!

14:30.185 --> 14:31.152
- How do you know?

14:31.186 --> 14:33.855
- Look what they wrote.
Look at the status!

14:36.859 --> 14:39.794
- "I'm a naughty, bad girl.
Someone should spank me."

14:39.828 --> 14:41.195
Someone has a sick
sense of humour.

14:41.230 --> 14:43.197
You gotta change
your password.

14:43.232 --> 14:45.166
No one should
look at this.

14:52.241 --> 14:54.008
(sighing)

14:54.043 --> 14:56.244
- It's too late.

15:00.015 --> 15:01.916
Oh!

15:01.951 --> 15:03.251
(crying)

15:06.989 --> 15:08.756
(sighing)

15:08.791 --> 15:11.025
(water dripping)

15:12.895 --> 15:15.163
(breathing unevenly)

15:26.375 --> 15:27.475
- You ok?
(scof- no!

15:27.509 --> 15:29.544
- Who do you think
changed your status?

15:29.578 --> 15:31.646
Who knew your password?

15:31.680 --> 15:33.414
- I don't know! I don't know!

15:33.449 --> 15:36.517
I made samantha and cheyenne
look away when I set it up.

15:36.552 --> 15:38.286
- I looked around
this website.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.355
It's inappropriate
for someone your age.

15:40.389 --> 15:41.456
There are
no boundaries.

15:41.490 --> 15:43.391
You need to shut down
your profile.

15:43.425 --> 15:44.525
- Come on!
- Look at you!

15:44.560 --> 15:46.594
You're in tears
after one day!

15:46.629 --> 15:47.729
Just shut it down.

15:49.732 --> 15:50.765
(sniffling)

15:50.799 --> 15:52.467
(sighing)

15:54.570 --> 15:55.803
It's not worth it.

15:58.474 --> 16:00.575
Honey, it's not worth it.

16:11.353 --> 16:12.620
(beeping)

16:15.724 --> 16:16.824
(sighing)

16:28.804 --> 16:30.738
(beeping)

16:32.808 --> 16:34.776
(line ringing)

16:34.810 --> 16:36.544
- (samantha):
Hello?

16:36.578 --> 16:38.346
- Hey.

16:38.380 --> 16:40.615
Hey, are you still in
a "pissy" mood?

16:40.649 --> 16:41.649
(samantha sighing)

16:41.684 --> 16:43.651
- Shut up and come over.

16:43.686 --> 16:46.354
You can put what happened
in your status, right?

16:46.388 --> 16:47.689
And then you change
your password.

16:47.723 --> 16:49.691
Not to something easy
like your birthday.

16:49.725 --> 16:51.426
- It wasn't
my birthday before

16:51.460 --> 16:53.461
Or like anything
anyone could've guessed.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.632
God, all those things
people were saying about me.

16:57.666 --> 17:00.435
How am I gonna face going
to school on Monday?

17:00.469 --> 17:01.436
- Don't be a wuss.

17:01.470 --> 17:03.438
You can't take that
stuff seriously.

17:03.472 --> 17:06.374
Besides, nobody's even gonna
remember it by Monday.

17:06.407 --> 17:09.310
- Hey, one good thing
happened on clicksters today.

17:09.344 --> 17:10.744
I talked to
this guy named james.

17:10.779 --> 17:11.746
(scoffing)

17:11.780 --> 17:14.415
What? You should've seen
what he wrote me.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.384
It was, like, really
smart and funny.

17:16.417 --> 17:18.586
- Oh! Let's not
talk about boys.

17:18.619 --> 17:21.789
We can rent a movie,
you can sleep over.

17:21.824 --> 17:23.491
- Ok, fine.

17:23.525 --> 17:26.594
♪when I see it in your eyes ♪

17:26.627 --> 17:30.331
why do you haunt me? 

17:30.365 --> 17:34.502
I feel so alive 

17:34.536 --> 17:36.504
Hello!

17:36.538 --> 17:40.308
my body's burning 

17:42.311 --> 17:43.711
Good morning.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.351
What's going on?

17:50.385 --> 17:51.619
- Eric.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.421
Tell her.

17:57.426 --> 17:59.594
- Me and my friend cooper
were the ones that

17:59.628 --> 18:01.529
Changed the status
on your profile.

18:01.563 --> 18:02.563
- What?

18:02.598 --> 18:05.333
- You used the old cat's
name for your password.

18:05.367 --> 18:07.568
- I'm gonna kill you!

18:07.603 --> 18:08.736
- Taylor, come back here.

18:08.771 --> 18:10.705
- I can't believe
he did that to me!

18:10.739 --> 18:13.407
- Taylor!

18:13.442 --> 18:16.644
Look it, I am really
upset with him too.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.513
I've grounded him
for a month.

18:18.547 --> 18:20.481
But I'm really upset
with you too.

18:20.516 --> 18:21.716
- What did I do?

18:21.750 --> 18:24.652
- I looked to see if you
took down your profile.

18:24.686 --> 18:26.487
- I never said I'd do that.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.489
- Well, on your page,
you posted a comment

18:28.524 --> 18:29.657
And called
someone a bitch.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.492
- Whoa! Now you're
spying on me?

18:31.527 --> 18:34.462
- When you put something online,
it's no longer private.

18:34.496 --> 18:36.430
Everyone can see it
and you know my rule.

18:36.465 --> 18:39.467
You can't use the internet to be
insulting or call anyone names.

18:39.501 --> 18:41.602
- What about what
they called me?

18:41.637 --> 18:43.404
- I know it's terrible,

18:43.438 --> 18:46.407
But that's no excuse to be ugly
to someone online or anywhere.

18:46.441 --> 18:48.376
- Fine. I'm sorry.
I won't do it again.

18:48.410 --> 18:50.311
- To make sure
you won't do it again,

18:50.345 --> 18:51.479
I'm taking away
your laptop.

18:51.513 --> 18:52.480
- Oh, come on.

18:52.514 --> 18:53.548
- Going on the internet

18:53.582 --> 18:55.483
Means responsibility
and consequences.

18:55.517 --> 18:57.318
You'll get it back
in 3 days.

18:57.352 --> 18:58.753
- Wonderful.

18:58.787 --> 18:59.754
Eric!

18:59.788 --> 19:02.390
- Taylor, behave yourself!

19:02.424 --> 19:04.659
- I can't believe your own
brother did that to you.

19:04.693 --> 19:06.327
It's disgusting.
It's gross.

19:06.361 --> 19:08.396
- I'm never going to
forgive him. I told him:

19:08.430 --> 19:09.730
"I'm not going to
your graduation.

19:09.765 --> 19:12.333
"I'm not going
to your wedding.

19:12.367 --> 19:13.668
"I might go to your funeral."

19:13.702 --> 19:15.336
(cheyenne chuckling0

19:15.370 --> 19:17.572
- Damn! Tayhill actually
came to school today.

19:17.606 --> 19:18.673
I owe you 5 bucks.

19:18.707 --> 19:20.374
- What's your problem?

19:20.409 --> 19:23.444
- Oh, I don't have
a problem.

19:23.478 --> 19:27.415
You do, little miss
I'd-never-go-all-the-way.

19:27.449 --> 19:28.616
- Such a hypocrite.

19:28.650 --> 19:31.419
- How many guys did you
hook up with this weekend?

19:31.453 --> 19:33.454
Ten? Twenty?

19:33.488 --> 19:34.789
- You should have
a drive-thru.

19:34.823 --> 19:36.490
(girls laughing)

19:36.525 --> 19:38.559
lights are fading... 

19:38.594 --> 19:41.462
- You said everyone was
gonna forget it by Monday.

19:41.496 --> 19:44.298
- Ok, people have been posting
really stupid stuff

19:44.333 --> 19:45.466
On your page all weekend.

19:45.500 --> 19:46.467
- What?

19:46.501 --> 19:48.369
- They're saying
you sleep around.

19:48.403 --> 19:49.537
- Why didn't
you tell me?

19:49.571 --> 19:52.406
- Well, samantha didn't want
to freak you out and--

19:52.441 --> 19:54.609
- I honestly thought it would
die down by now.

19:54.643 --> 19:56.510
- I have to see.
Give me your phone.

19:56.545 --> 19:57.745
I have to see
what's going on.

19:57.779 --> 19:59.647
- You don't have
to see it right now.

19:59.681 --> 20:01.482
- Yeah, I have to
see it right now.

20:01.516 --> 20:03.651
If everyone's seen it,
then scott has seen it.

20:03.685 --> 20:05.353
Please, can I use your phone?

20:05.387 --> 20:07.288
- No, I'm not gonna
give you my phone.

20:07.322 --> 20:08.589
(scoffing)

20:08.624 --> 20:09.690
hearts are waitin' 

20:09.725 --> 20:11.459
(school bell ringing)

20:11.493 --> 20:14.595
you can see it in his eyes 

20:14.630 --> 20:18.666
lights are fadin' 

20:18.700 --> 20:22.737
you can see it, see it 

20:24.773 --> 20:27.708
- I saw what people were
saying about you online.

20:28.777 --> 20:31.379
I don't know why
they have to do that.

20:32.781 --> 20:34.682
It sucks.

20:36.585 --> 20:38.419
- How would you know?

20:39.755 --> 20:41.589
- You serious?

20:43.458 --> 20:46.460
- You've been called
a slut and a whore? Really?

20:48.530 --> 20:50.598
- I guess you've never
been on my page.

20:50.632 --> 20:52.733
There's fairy...

20:52.768 --> 20:55.703
Fruit, homo.

20:55.737 --> 20:57.605
Too gay to live.

20:57.639 --> 21:00.608
- Yeah, but I mean, it's not
really the same thing.

21:00.642 --> 21:02.376
I mean, you really are gay.

21:02.411 --> 21:04.578
What they're saying
about me isn't true.

21:06.381 --> 21:09.383
- You really don't get
how messed up it is.

21:15.657 --> 21:17.758
(school bell ringing)

21:17.793 --> 21:19.527
(girl laughing)

21:23.598 --> 21:26.634
- (susan):    I sit behind you
in algebra. You smell weird.

21:26.668 --> 21:29.437
- (lisa):
That's what skanks smell like.

21:29.471 --> 21:30.838
- (lindsay):
What, like puke?

21:30.872 --> 21:33.674
- (samantha):    Jealous much?
She's smarter than you.

21:34.776 --> 21:37.745
- "then why doesn't she know
she's a loser?"

21:37.779 --> 21:39.580
- And then james wrote:

21:39.614 --> 21:42.350
"haters suck. The girl
is more cool than you."

21:42.384 --> 21:43.684
- He defended me.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.653
- He is a gentleman.

21:46.688 --> 21:48.556
- Ah, I'm gonna
write him back

21:48.590 --> 21:49.590
And say thank you.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.362
- Ask him if
he knows my cousin.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.335
(dog barking)

22:01.370 --> 22:02.470
- You all finished?

22:04.373 --> 22:05.506
Then back to your room.

22:05.540 --> 22:07.742
- You're gonna keep me
a prisoner for a month?

22:07.776 --> 22:09.610
- Yeah, she is.
- Taylor!

22:09.644 --> 22:12.713
Honey, you really need
to go to your room.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.482
(sighing)

22:15.817 --> 22:18.552
- Dad would've never
let you ground me

22:18.587 --> 22:20.488
For something this stupid!

22:21.723 --> 22:23.724
- I get my laptop back
tomorrow, right?

22:23.759 --> 22:26.360
- Yeah. You gonna take
your profile down?

22:26.395 --> 22:27.795
- Are you saying
I have no choice?

22:27.829 --> 22:31.465
- No, I'm saying I'm trusting
you to make the right choice.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.868
- Well, who says that's
the right choice?

22:35.704 --> 22:38.506
You know, everyone at
my school is on that site.

22:38.540 --> 22:39.607
I was just
having fun.

22:39.641 --> 22:41.776
It was eric who messed
it all up for me.

22:43.779 --> 22:47.548
You know, I wish
you wouldn't fake-trust me.

22:47.582 --> 22:49.683
I wish you would just
actually do it.

22:56.458 --> 22:57.725
-  Hey.

22:57.759 --> 22:58.793
- Hey!

22:58.827 --> 23:00.661
- It's the seedy
underbelly.

23:00.695 --> 23:01.695
- Oh my god!

23:01.730 --> 23:03.431
- I know! Look at her!
- Ah!

23:03.465 --> 23:04.565
(both laughing)

23:05.767 --> 23:07.468
(sighing)

23:07.502 --> 23:09.703
- I'm not gonna
let it bother me.

23:09.738 --> 23:11.605
You know, I don't care
what they think.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.541
- That's what
james told her.

23:13.575 --> 23:14.708
I let her borrow my phone.

23:14.743 --> 23:16.544
Look what he said.

23:16.578 --> 23:19.814
- "even though we've never met,
I feel like I know you.

23:19.848 --> 23:21.348
"you make me melt."

23:21.383 --> 23:22.583
Is this guy
for real?

23:22.617 --> 23:24.718
- I can't believe
I'm actually encouraging this.

23:24.753 --> 23:26.821
- Yeah, why are you
encouraging this?

23:26.855 --> 23:28.589
- For you to see
the difference

23:28.623 --> 23:30.424
Between a guy that
is genuinely nice

23:30.459 --> 23:32.526
And a guy that just wants
to hook up with you.

23:32.561 --> 23:33.828
- You don't like scott anymore?

23:33.862 --> 23:35.729
- Like that was ever
gonna happen.

23:35.764 --> 23:38.399
- Why not?
Thirteen messages.

23:38.433 --> 23:40.367
That's a lot
of messages.

23:40.402 --> 23:41.669
- But scott was this fantasy guy

23:41.703 --> 23:43.604
That might like me
if I was different.

23:43.638 --> 23:45.673
But james likes me
for who I am.

23:45.707 --> 23:46.740
- Oh!

23:46.775 --> 23:48.709
- Now I just need
my computer back

23:48.743 --> 23:50.411
So I can
write him back.

23:50.445 --> 23:52.379
- That sounds like love.
- It might be.

23:52.414 --> 23:54.415
Oh, I need ketchup.
Hang on.

23:54.449 --> 23:55.416
- Oh!

23:55.450 --> 23:56.717
- Oh! Sorry.
- Sorry.

23:56.751 --> 23:58.652
I was just going
to get ketchup.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.454
- Oh, me too.

24:00.489 --> 24:03.524
- I was actually gonna come
look for you after lunch.

24:03.558 --> 24:04.525
- You were?

24:04.559 --> 24:06.727
- Yeah, I heard somebody
hacked your profile.

24:06.761 --> 24:09.430
It happened to me once.
Sucked really bad.

24:09.464 --> 24:11.565
- My brother did it.
That's what's even worse.

24:11.600 --> 24:13.534
- Oh man, your brother? Really?
- Yeah.

24:13.568 --> 24:15.769
- Should I have a chat with him?
Straighten him out?

24:15.804 --> 24:16.804
- Please, yes.

24:16.838 --> 24:18.672
(both laughing)

24:18.707 --> 24:20.808
- No, but seriously,
I was gonna come find you.

24:20.842 --> 24:22.576
I wanted to see
if you wanna go

24:22.611 --> 24:24.578
To the spring fling
dance with me.

24:24.613 --> 24:26.680
- You're asking me
to the dance?

24:26.715 --> 24:28.782
- If you're already
going with someone,

24:28.817 --> 24:30.751
That's totally cool.

24:30.785 --> 24:32.353
- Oh no! I mean, yes!

24:32.387 --> 24:33.354
(chuckles)

24:33.388 --> 24:35.389
I mean, no I'm not
going with anyone

24:35.423 --> 24:36.657
And yes,
I will go with you.

24:36.691 --> 24:37.625
- Yeah?

24:37.659 --> 24:38.692
- Yeah.
- Ok, cool.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.595
Why don't you send me a message,
give me your number.

24:41.630 --> 24:44.398
- Ok, sure. Ok.

24:46.668 --> 24:50.671
- Why did you tell him
you weren't going with anyone?

24:50.705 --> 24:52.706
The 3 of us were
gonna go together.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.642
- Why can't you
be happy for her?

24:54.676 --> 24:57.478
- I'd be happy for you if
someone you liked asked you.

24:57.512 --> 24:58.746
- A minute ago
you liked james.

24:58.780 --> 25:01.749
- I don't know if I would
like him in real life.

25:01.783 --> 25:03.317
I've never met him.

25:03.351 --> 25:04.318
- Ketchup?

25:04.352 --> 25:05.352
- Oh yeah. Thank you.

25:05.387 --> 25:06.487
(taylor chuckles)

25:08.356 --> 25:09.356
(whispering): Ketchup?

25:09.391 --> 25:10.357
(giggling)

25:10.392 --> 25:12.526
- You wanna know
about scott?

25:13.662 --> 25:16.630
Charlie told him about
some stuff he and I did,

25:16.665 --> 25:18.532
And you know
what scott did?

25:20.368 --> 25:21.735
He laughed.

25:23.538 --> 25:25.573
You're gonna
get hurt, taylor.

25:26.808 --> 25:28.809
- I mean, just 'cause
you got dumped,

25:28.843 --> 25:30.444
Doesn't mean I will.

25:33.582 --> 25:34.815
- Thanks.

25:42.524 --> 25:44.325
- Guess what!

25:44.359 --> 25:45.459
Guess what,
guess what!

25:45.493 --> 25:47.595
Get out of the car!
Get out of the car!

25:48.597 --> 25:50.331
- Your father called?

25:51.333 --> 25:52.633
- Uh, no.

25:52.667 --> 25:54.368
- Sorry, bad question.

25:54.402 --> 25:56.337
Why are you
so excited?

25:56.371 --> 25:59.707
- Scott ozsik asked me
to the spring fling.

25:59.741 --> 26:01.575
- That's wonderful, sweetheart.

26:01.610 --> 26:03.777
- So can I have
my laptop back now?

26:03.812 --> 26:05.479
- Ok, fine.

26:08.683 --> 26:10.384
(beeping)

26:13.488 --> 26:15.789
(door opening)

26:18.593 --> 26:20.461
- What are you
guys doing here?

26:20.495 --> 26:21.762
- Cheyenne made
me drive her.

26:21.796 --> 26:24.365
- You haven't seen it yet?

26:24.399 --> 26:27.334
- No. What?
- Your wall.

26:27.369 --> 26:28.769
- No, I just got
my computer back.

26:28.803 --> 26:30.738
What, did lindsay
post more stuff?

26:30.772 --> 26:32.706
- Um, not lindsay.

26:32.741 --> 26:35.509
That james guy
you thought was so nice.

26:40.515 --> 26:42.416
He's saying
he slept with you...

26:42.450 --> 26:43.651
That you gave him
an std.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.656
(beeping)

26:54.329 --> 26:55.663
- Oh!

27:04.506 --> 27:06.473
- (girl 1):
No wonder she reeks.

27:06.508 --> 27:09.343
- (boy): She's always made me
want to throw up.

27:11.446 --> 27:13.647
(crying)

27:13.682 --> 27:15.416
(sobbing)

27:15.450 --> 27:16.750
- (girl 2she's a loser.

27:16.785 --> 27:19.720
- (susan): I sit behind you in
algebra. You smell weird.

27:19.754 --> 27:21.355
-    The clap.
- Skanky whore.

27:21.389 --> 27:22.790
Gross! Don't breathe
around her.

27:22.824 --> 27:24.692
You'll get infected.

27:28.847 --> 27:30.247
Watch abc fami
- I don't get it

27:30.281 --> 27:33.150
God, why would he say
that he slept with me

27:33.184 --> 27:34.852
Or got an std from me?

27:34.886 --> 27:36.053
I never even met him!

27:36.087 --> 27:37.021
(beeping)

27:37.055 --> 27:38.155
- I'm so sorry.

27:39.824 --> 27:40.791
(gasps)

27:40.825 --> 27:42.026
- I knew it.

27:43.061 --> 27:45.229
I told my cousin to look
at james's profile.

27:45.263 --> 27:47.031
And see if she recognized him.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.133
She says there's
no such guy at ridgeway.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.068
- Maybe she's just
never met him.

27:51.102 --> 27:52.770
- There's 300 people there.

27:52.804 --> 27:54.772
She'd recognize him
if he went there.

27:54.806 --> 27:56.240
- What, so he's fake?

27:56.274 --> 27:59.209
- Well, he's full of crap,
so yeah, he's fake.

27:59.244 --> 28:02.112
I bet you 100 bucks someone
just put up that fake profile.

28:02.147 --> 28:03.881
- Oh, lindsay!

28:03.915 --> 28:06.250
Yeah, lindsay would totally
do something like that.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.952
Oh god! All the stuff
that I told him.

28:08.987 --> 28:11.088
I told him my dad
cheated on my mom!

28:11.122 --> 28:13.157
Like, all kinds of
personal stuff.

28:16.127 --> 28:17.861
What if he posts it?

28:17.896 --> 28:20.998
- Almost dinner.
Time to go soon, girls, ok?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.966
- Thanks.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.008
- No. No, I'm not
gonna tell her.

28:31.042 --> 28:33.911
No, I just got
my laptop back.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.947
(birds chirping)

28:39.184 --> 28:40.217
- Wanna try?

28:40.251 --> 28:42.152
Mmm!

28:42.187 --> 28:43.754
(toilet flushing)

28:43.788 --> 28:45.756
- No, I might
look slutty.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.024
(scoffing)

28:47.058 --> 28:49.993
- Is that why you're wearing
all those baggy clothes?

28:51.996 --> 28:54.932
- Did you see what people were
saying about me last night?

28:54.966 --> 28:57.835
- You're not even in the
neighbourhood of being a slut.

28:57.869 --> 29:00.170
And your status says
that you never slept with james.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.106
- I don't understand
what I did wrong.

29:03.975 --> 29:05.209
- Dang!

29:05.243 --> 29:07.945
Should've brought
the disinfectant.

29:07.979 --> 29:11.048
Don't wanna use these sinks
after the skank patrol.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.282
(girls laughing)

29:14.819 --> 29:16.086
- Sick.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.090
- Calling me
a skank now too?

29:20.125 --> 29:21.191
- Yeah, I know.
It sucks.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.227
- I've never been called
a name at school.

29:23.261 --> 29:24.828
- You know what they say.

29:24.863 --> 29:26.797
Sticks and stones
may break your bones--

29:26.831 --> 29:28.031
- Don't make
a joke about this.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.199
Don't you dare!

29:29.234 --> 29:31.301
Just stop
following me, ok?

29:32.904 --> 29:34.972
- She blames me for
what lindsay said?

29:35.006 --> 29:36.840
- I'll go talk to her.

29:37.842 --> 29:38.842
(sighing)

29:38.877 --> 29:40.144
(inaudible)

29:49.020 --> 29:50.788
- Scott, hey.

29:50.822 --> 29:52.956
- Hey, what's up?

29:52.991 --> 29:54.858
- Uh, nothing.

29:54.893 --> 29:57.027
Look, I know that
a lot of people

29:57.061 --> 29:59.229
Are saying stuff
about me online.

29:59.264 --> 30:01.064
This stuff's
totally not true,

30:01.099 --> 30:03.834
And I guess I just want
to make sure--

30:03.868 --> 30:04.902
- It's not a big deal.

30:04.936 --> 30:05.969
- Well, it kind of is.

30:06.004 --> 30:07.237
Um...

30:07.272 --> 30:09.206
It's really
gross stuff and--

30:09.240 --> 30:10.841
(chuckles)

30:10.875 --> 30:14.077
Look, I haven't slept with
anybody or anything, and...

30:15.113 --> 30:16.980
- I'll see you
in history.

30:19.884 --> 30:21.285
(scoffing)

30:23.154 --> 30:24.988
(sighing)

30:25.023 --> 30:26.924
♪♪♪

30:34.299 --> 30:36.934
it's amazing 

30:36.968 --> 30:38.936
so amazing how 

30:38.970 --> 30:40.070
(school bell ringing)

30:40.104 --> 30:43.173
I survived this road 

30:43.208 --> 30:45.809
feel the fever 

30:45.844 --> 30:50.881
I can feel it
down inside my soul 

30:50.915 --> 30:55.252
and I will be the one
to build you up 

30:55.286 --> 30:57.888
I'll build you up 

30:59.858 --> 31:03.861
I'll be the one
to never doubt 

31:03.895 --> 31:06.129
I'll never doubt 

31:06.164 --> 31:08.065
oh, oh 

31:08.099 --> 31:09.833
can you see how 

31:09.868 --> 31:13.303
can you see how far
we've come? 

31:13.338 --> 31:15.839
such a miracle 

31:15.874 --> 31:17.007
(doorbell ringing)

31:17.041 --> 31:18.008
everything is 

31:18.042 --> 31:19.309
everything is clear 

31:19.344 --> 31:23.046
and you are such a wonder 

31:23.081 --> 31:26.083
and I would be the one 

31:26.117 --> 31:27.985
to build you up 

31:28.019 --> 31:29.987
build you up... 

31:31.322 --> 31:33.290
- You can
come in, you know.

31:33.324 --> 31:35.993
- Just let me
ask you one thing.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.928
I'll never doubt... 

31:37.962 --> 31:39.263
Are you still
my friend?

31:39.297 --> 31:41.965
- Yeah, I guess.

31:42.000 --> 31:45.002
- What does that mean? My friend
everywhere except school?

31:45.036 --> 31:46.937
- Look, I don't know
what you expect.

31:46.971 --> 31:48.939
None of this
is my fault.

31:48.973 --> 31:51.208
- Samantha's standing by me.
Why can't you?

31:51.242 --> 31:54.945
- Why can't you not flirt
with people you don't know?

31:54.979 --> 31:57.214
You didn't have to talk
to that james guy.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.816
- You think all this
is my fault?

31:59.851 --> 32:01.251
- You called lindsay
a bitch online.

32:01.286 --> 32:03.220
Of course she was gonna
come after you.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.957
I'll be the one
to build you up 

32:06.991 --> 32:10.027
I'll build you up 

32:10.061 --> 32:14.164
I'll be the one 
who'll never doubt 

32:14.198 --> 32:17.034
I'll never doubt 

32:17.068 --> 32:19.903
- I made spaghetti for dinner
if you'd like some.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.905
(telephone ringing)

32:21.940 --> 32:22.906
(sighing)

32:22.941 --> 32:23.974
to hold your hand 

32:24.008 --> 32:25.142
I'll hold your hand 

32:27.178 --> 32:28.245
- Hello.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.247
-    Hi, kris? This is
darren mortenson,

32:30.281 --> 32:31.848
Cheyenne's  father.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.250
- Oh, hi, darren.
How have you been?

32:33.284 --> 32:34.885
Kris, I don't know--

32:34.919 --> 32:37.921
Are you aware of what's
been happening with taylor?

32:47.832 --> 32:50.834
- Show me your
clicksters page now!

33:02.880 --> 33:05.215
Why didn't you shut this down
when I asked you to?

33:05.249 --> 33:08.285
And why would you
subject yourself to this?

33:10.021 --> 33:13.023
Shut it down, taylor.
You have no choice anymore.

33:15.126 --> 33:17.094
(sniffling)

33:17.128 --> 33:18.195
(beeping)

33:18.229 --> 33:21.098
- Oh, look, mom!
A new comment!

33:21.132 --> 33:23.100
I'm so popular!

33:23.134 --> 33:26.069
No, this one's from lindsayluv.
She's my favourite.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.038
Yeah, she says
that james told her

33:28.072 --> 33:30.273
I took all my clothes off
for 5 bucks.

33:34.212 --> 33:36.046
(sobs)

34:25.129 --> 34:27.731
(dog barking)

34:29.833 --> 34:32.101
- Did you change your mind
about going to school?

34:32.136 --> 34:34.737
- You said I could have
one day to stay home.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.072
- I just don't want you

34:36.107 --> 34:38.675
To get in the habit
of avoiding your problems.

34:38.708 --> 34:40.911
Sometimes the best thing
is to face things head on,

34:40.945 --> 34:41.911
Don't you think?

34:41.946 --> 34:44.581
Maybe you should just
walk into your school

34:44.614 --> 34:46.650
With your head high
and tell those kids

34:46.684 --> 34:48.784
They shouldn't believe
everything they see

34:48.820 --> 34:49.786
On the internet.

34:49.821 --> 34:51.088
- That's gonna
be a big help.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.927
- I'm gonna stop by your school
and tell your principal.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.028
- Great.

34:58.062 --> 34:59.863
(sighing)

35:08.706 --> 35:10.040
(sighing)

35:11.075 --> 35:12.742
(beeping)

35:13.744 --> 35:15.078
(line ringing)

35:15.113 --> 35:17.013
-    Hi, you've reached brett.

35:17.048 --> 35:19.749
I can't get to
the phone right now.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.618
Please leave a message.

35:21.652 --> 35:22.786
(beep)

35:22.820 --> 35:25.655
- Hey, dad.
It's me, taylor.

35:25.690 --> 35:27.924
Um, I know you probably
didn't pick up

35:27.959 --> 35:31.695
Because you think
I'm still mad at you, but, um...

35:32.997 --> 35:34.731
Ok, I take back what I said

35:34.765 --> 35:36.933
About never wanting
to speak to you again.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.802
Uh... You--

35:43.641 --> 35:45.041
I just feel so alone right now

35:45.076 --> 35:48.044
And I don't know if you care
or not, but, um...

35:52.049 --> 35:53.650
(sniffling)

35:53.684 --> 35:54.851
Just call me back.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.853
(sighing)

35:59.056 --> 36:00.991
- You're preaching to the choir.

36:01.025 --> 36:03.660
I know bullying over
the internet is a problem.

36:03.694 --> 36:04.761
It's given me a headache.

36:04.795 --> 36:06.897
I still can't figure out
what to do about it.

36:06.931 --> 36:10.033
- Well, why wouldn't you treat a
cyberbully like any other bully?

36:10.067 --> 36:11.902
- Well, I can't control
the internet

36:11.936 --> 36:14.704
Or what students do on their
own computers at home.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.873
And this kind of bullying,

36:16.908 --> 36:20.777
Well, it happens using
anonymous user names.

36:20.811 --> 36:24.881
You can't tell who's who
and who started what.

36:24.916 --> 36:27.884
- But the kids know who's who.
They can tell you.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.921
- Well, maybe, but unless
I can get the school board

36:30.955 --> 36:32.689
To give me some guidelines

36:32.723 --> 36:34.925
That allows me to
compel them to do so...

36:34.959 --> 36:37.961
- Well, you must have
some kind of policy.

36:37.995 --> 36:40.564
- A vague one created
by insurance companies

36:40.598 --> 36:41.998
To protect the school
from liability.

36:42.033 --> 36:44.768
Half the time, I don't know
where I stand legally.

36:44.802 --> 36:47.737
I keep asking the school board
to give me some policies

36:47.772 --> 36:49.673
That has some teeth
that I can use

36:49.707 --> 36:51.675
To bite down
on these kids, but...

36:53.911 --> 36:55.645
(sighing)

36:55.680 --> 36:57.747
(birds chirping)

37:06.624 --> 37:07.791
- Hey.

37:09.994 --> 37:11.661
Look, I promised my mom

37:11.696 --> 37:13.930
I wouldn't go on clicksters
on my computer.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.932
Can I use yours?

37:17.068 --> 37:18.835
- Sure.

37:21.939 --> 37:23.840
(beeping)

37:31.649 --> 37:34.985
- Now they're saying I missed
school because I'm pregnant

37:35.019 --> 37:36.987
And I'm some kind of prostitute.

37:37.021 --> 37:40.657
- Nobody believes that stuff.
- Maybe cheyenne was right.

37:40.691 --> 37:41.658
I was asking for it.

37:41.692 --> 37:42.726
- Cheyenne's stupid.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.761
- No, I told all
that personal stuff

37:44.795 --> 37:46.663
To james.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.598
Ha! I didn't
even know him.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.635
- Taylor, this is really hard--

37:51.669 --> 37:53.770
- You know, scott
reads that stuff.

37:53.804 --> 37:56.973
I mean, what if he believes it?
What if he thinks I'm pregnant?

37:57.008 --> 38:00.644
- Wait, that's what you're
worried about right now? Scott?

38:00.678 --> 38:02.712
- Yeah! Yeah, I'm
worried about scott.

38:02.747 --> 38:03.913
(scoffing)

38:03.948 --> 38:05.915
- Who cares what
he thinks, taylor?

38:05.950 --> 38:08.585
Where has scott been?
Nowhere!

38:08.619 --> 38:10.854
You even said yourself
he's been ignoring you!

38:10.888 --> 38:13.623
Now, all of a sudden
you care what he thinks?

38:13.658 --> 38:14.758
- Hey, stop
yelling at me!

38:14.792 --> 38:16.893
I can't take it if
you're against me too.

38:17.895 --> 38:19.896
(sighing)

38:21.666 --> 38:23.733
- I'm sorry.

38:27.738 --> 38:29.039
(sighing)

38:31.042 --> 38:33.076
I'm so sorry, taylor.

38:36.781 --> 38:38.982
None of this
should've happened.

38:50.061 --> 38:52.696
Maybe we should
forget school today.

38:52.730 --> 38:54.998
You wanna ditch?
I'll ditch with you?

38:56.067 --> 38:58.001
- No, I wanna
talk to scott.

38:58.035 --> 38:59.969
- Of course.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.774
Look, you should just get scott
to give you a ride home too,

39:04.809 --> 39:06.910
Because I'm done trying
to be your friend.

39:06.944 --> 39:08.611
Have a nice life, taylor.

39:22.059 --> 39:24.027
(school bell ringing)

39:45.850 --> 39:47.784
- Hey, scott.

39:48.819 --> 39:49.986
- Hey.

39:50.020 --> 39:52.756
- Hey, I know I haven't
talked to you in a while.

39:52.790 --> 39:53.990
Um, I was just wondering

39:54.024 --> 39:56.860
If we were still going
to the dance tonight?

39:57.862 --> 40:01.598
- Um, listen, taylor.

40:01.632 --> 40:02.999
My mom pissed
me off last night

40:03.033 --> 40:05.869
And said I have to go
with marnie fox.

40:05.903 --> 40:08.938
Her mom's best friends
with my mom, and--

40:09.940 --> 40:11.908
Yeah.

40:11.942 --> 40:13.877
- So you're
taking marnie?

40:13.911 --> 40:16.913
- I'm sorry. It's not
exactly my choice.

40:16.947 --> 40:20.617
But I don't know
what else to do.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.820
- Ok.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.756
- Just--

40:35.966 --> 40:37.901
(school bell ringing)

40:40.104 --> 40:41.070
(panting)

40:41.105 --> 40:43.873
- Oh! She's crying.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.809
She must've seen
the video.

40:45.843 --> 40:46.910
(girls laughing)

40:46.944 --> 40:48.678
- Everyone's seen it.

40:48.712 --> 40:50.013
500 views,
last time I checked.

40:50.047 --> 40:51.948
You guys have all
seen it, right?

40:51.982 --> 40:53.950
- Isn't it hysterical?

40:53.984 --> 40:55.919
(all laughing)

40:56.921 --> 40:59.722
- What video?

40:59.757 --> 41:00.824
(school bell ringing)

41:02.827 --> 41:04.794
- Just wait till
you see it.

41:04.829 --> 41:06.896
- Wait till she sees it!

41:07.965 --> 41:11.067
stack me up or crumble 

41:12.069 --> 41:14.904
and drift along 

41:18.742 --> 41:21.744
I am 

41:22.746 --> 41:25.882
just another nothing 

41:27.117 --> 41:30.153
light me up or fold in 

41:31.155 --> 41:33.990
and then be gone 

41:37.928 --> 41:40.997
(?woman vocalizing ?

41:52.776 --> 41:54.777
oh 

41:54.812 --> 41:57.046
(panting)

41:57.081 --> 41:59.082
I am 

42:00.084 --> 42:03.686
well-suited for erasing 

42:03.721 --> 42:04.921
(beep)

42:04.955 --> 42:08.892
fading into hazy 

42:08.926 --> 42:11.861
and sinking strong 

42:11.896 --> 42:13.663
(beep)

42:22.973 --> 42:26.976
- I'm taylor hillridge.
Wanna have a good time?

42:27.011 --> 42:30.113
5 bucks, all it takes!

42:30.147 --> 42:32.916
- You smell like
a bit of a sewer.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.784
You ever take shower?

42:34.818 --> 42:38.755
How about 2 bucks...
Or $1? 50 cents?

42:38.789 --> 42:41.658
How about I pay you
to show me a good time?

42:41.692 --> 42:42.892
- Ew! Gross!

42:42.927 --> 42:44.827
-    I act like
I'm the most holy

42:44.862 --> 42:46.696
And pure thing at school.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.665
But I'm really

42:48.699 --> 42:51.968
The dirtiest little whore.

42:55.639 --> 42:57.674
(sobbing)

43:07.718 --> 43:08.851
help 

43:08.886 --> 43:13.723
I have done it again 

43:15.793 --> 43:19.028
I have been here 

43:19.063 --> 43:21.931
many times before 

43:21.966 --> 43:23.766
(sobbing)

43:23.801 --> 43:28.871
hurt myself again today 

43:31.141 --> 43:34.911
and the worse part 

43:34.945 --> 43:39.716
is there's no one
else to blame 

43:40.718 --> 43:43.720
be my friend 

43:43.754 --> 43:45.955
(panting)

43:45.990 --> 43:48.591
hold me 

43:48.626 --> 43:50.927
wrap me up 

43:53.897 --> 43:56.833
unfold me 

43:56.867 --> 44:00.903
I am small 

44:00.938 --> 44:01.904
(crying)

44:01.939 --> 44:04.040
I'm needy 

44:04.074 --> 44:07.677
warm me up 

44:07.711 --> 44:09.746
(sighing)

44:09.780 --> 44:14.784
and breathe me 

44:14.818 --> 44:16.953
- I'm the real taylor hillridge.

44:16.987 --> 44:21.924
ouch, I have lost
myself again 

44:24.094 --> 44:27.664
lost myself 

44:27.698 --> 44:32.635
and I am going
into the fire 

44:32.670 --> 44:34.637
(sobbing)

44:34.672 --> 44:37.974
yes, I think that
I might break 

44:39.910 --> 44:43.880
lost myself again 

44:43.914 --> 44:48.951
and I feel unsafe 

44:48.986 --> 44:51.788
be my friend 

44:51.822 --> 44:53.056
(sighing)

44:53.090 --> 44:55.658
I'm the real taylor hillridge.

44:55.693 --> 44:58.594
fold me 

44:58.629 --> 45:00.730
wrap me up 

45:00.764 --> 45:03.700
And I don't know why
everybody hates me so much!

45:03.734 --> 45:06.836
?unfold me
I am small... 

45:06.870 --> 45:07.937
But maybe I do,

45:07.971 --> 45:10.640
Because now I hate me too.

45:10.674 --> 45:11.841
I'm needy... 

45:11.875 --> 45:13.609
And right now,

45:13.644 --> 45:16.746
I really don't see
the reason for trying...

45:16.780 --> 45:18.881
(sniffling)

45:18.916 --> 45:20.850
...Or for talking

45:20.884 --> 45:24.654
Or for breathing.

45:24.688 --> 45:26.856
I'm just done.

45:26.890 --> 45:28.057
(gasping)

45:28.092 --> 45:31.928
hold me
wrap me up 

45:31.962 --> 45:34.030
So that's it, I guess.

45:34.064 --> 45:36.666
unfold me 

45:36.700 --> 45:38.668
Bye.

45:38.702 --> 45:39.969
I am small... 

45:46.076 --> 45:48.010
- Pick up the phone, taylor.

45:48.045 --> 45:49.912
(cell phone ringing)

45:49.947 --> 45:52.048
(sobbing)

45:54.785 --> 45:57.687
Pick up the phone, taylor!

45:57.721 --> 45:59.021
Taylor?

46:00.023 --> 46:01.691
(cell phone ringing)

46:01.725 --> 46:02.925
- This is kris.

46:02.960 --> 46:05.061
- It's samantha. Something's
wrong with taylor.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.696
She posted a video online.

46:06.730 --> 46:08.030
Now she's not answering
the phone.

46:08.065 --> 46:09.832
And I'm really freaking out.

46:09.867 --> 46:11.901
- Slow down.
I can't understand you.

46:11.935 --> 46:13.870
- I think she's trying
to kill herself.

46:13.904 --> 46:15.037
- Oh my god!

46:15.072 --> 46:16.873
(whispering): Oh my god!

46:22.746 --> 46:24.046
- Taylor?

46:25.048 --> 46:26.816
Taylor?

46:26.850 --> 46:27.884
Where's taylor?

46:27.918 --> 46:29.886
- How should I know?
I'm grounded.

46:29.920 --> 46:31.754
- Taylor?

46:32.890 --> 46:35.625
Taylor? Taylor!

46:35.659 --> 46:37.660
(siren)

46:37.694 --> 46:38.995
Taylor?

46:50.808 --> 46:51.774
Taylor?

46:51.809 --> 46:52.909
(taylor grunting)

46:55.813 --> 46:56.879
(grunting)

46:56.914 --> 46:58.648
- I can't get the cap off!

46:58.682 --> 46:59.682
No!

46:59.716 --> 47:02.685
- Give it to me!
Give it to me!

47:02.719 --> 47:04.720
- Taylor?

47:04.755 --> 47:06.923
- Taylor, let go!

47:07.991 --> 47:09.959
(sobbing hysterically)

47:09.993 --> 47:11.828
- What did you do?

47:11.862 --> 47:13.863
- Sit down, sit down,
sit down. Back up.

47:13.897 --> 47:15.765
(sobbing)

47:15.799 --> 47:17.600
It's ok.

47:17.634 --> 47:19.035
I got you.

47:21.104 --> 47:23.873
Baby, it's ok.

47:23.907 --> 47:25.741
(taylor sobbing)

47:25.776 --> 47:27.043
- (whispering): Please.

47:27.077 --> 47:30.780
- I wanna die. No!

47:32.816 --> 47:35.618
I wanna die!

47:35.652 --> 47:36.886
(man on cb, indistinct)

47:36.920 --> 47:39.055
(taylor sobbing)

47:52.886 --> 47:55.621
From the creator
of "pretty
(monitors beeping)

47:55.656 --> 47:58.791
- (woman on pa): Dr. David,
telephone, please.

47:58.825 --> 48:01.661
Dr. David, telephone, please.

48:03.597 --> 48:06.699
- You're awake. You ok?

48:06.733 --> 48:09.869
- Yeah. I feel funny.

48:10.871 --> 48:12.872
I'm sleepy.

48:12.906 --> 48:15.841
- That's the sedative.
It's starting to wear off.

48:18.478 --> 48:21.647
- Dr. Blair, dr. Blair,
telephone, please.

48:21.682 --> 48:23.516
- Hey, sammi.

48:23.550 --> 48:25.651
I'm ok.

48:33.560 --> 48:35.728
- I don't understand
how this happened.

48:35.762 --> 48:38.431
Did she tell you
she was so depressed?

48:38.465 --> 48:41.467
- Uh, I don't know. Maybe.

48:41.501 --> 48:44.804
- Did this happen because
this james kid turned on her?

48:44.838 --> 48:47.573
Do you know
who he is?

48:47.608 --> 48:49.742
- Um...

48:49.776 --> 48:52.578
Taylor found out
that he wasn't real.

48:52.613 --> 48:54.780
- What does that mean?

48:56.817 --> 48:59.852
- Someone posed as
james to torture her?

49:01.555 --> 49:04.490
Um, look,
I gotta go.

49:04.524 --> 49:06.659
My mom's gonna
be worried.

49:06.693 --> 49:09.762
Um, just have taylor
call me whenever.

49:15.869 --> 49:17.737
(sighing)

49:20.540 --> 49:22.842
(siren in distance)

49:24.778 --> 49:26.679
(sobbing)

49:28.815 --> 49:32.518
- I've talked to taylor and
I'd like to keep her overnight,

49:32.552 --> 49:33.686
Make sure she's stable.

49:33.720 --> 49:35.554
You can take her home
in the morning

49:35.589 --> 49:37.556
But you'll have to keep
a sharp eye on her.

49:37.591 --> 49:39.825
- I'm keeping her out of
school for the next week

49:39.860 --> 49:41.727
And I'm taking
a week off of work.

49:41.762 --> 49:43.696
- Good. If she starts
talking about

49:43.730 --> 49:45.564
Harming herself
again, call me.

49:45.599 --> 49:47.366
This is an
appointment card

49:47.401 --> 49:49.568
For her next one-one-one
session with me.

49:49.603 --> 49:53.572
And this is a teen
support group I run.

49:53.607 --> 49:54.774
It's twice a week.

49:54.808 --> 49:58.477
We talk about assertiveness,
bullying, other things.

49:58.512 --> 49:59.845
I think it might
help her.

49:59.880 --> 50:04.784
And finally, a prescription
for a mild tranquilizer.

50:04.818 --> 50:07.787
One tablet every 6 hours
for the next few days

50:07.821 --> 50:10.456
Or until you feel her mood
has evened out.

50:10.490 --> 50:13.459
It'll make her want to sleep
but that's a good thing.

50:13.493 --> 50:16.862
- I'm doing such
a great job on my own.

50:16.897 --> 50:19.699
- Taylor mentioned
you were divorced.

50:19.733 --> 50:21.634
I'm sure that's a factor,

50:21.668 --> 50:23.536
But being bullied online,

50:23.570 --> 50:25.838
That can push
a kid over the edge.

50:25.872 --> 50:28.474
It's like a group assault,
very traumatic.

50:28.508 --> 50:30.576
Anyone with
a computer can see it.

50:30.610 --> 50:32.578
It's always there, 24/7.

50:32.612 --> 50:35.481
Makes the victim feel
even more trapped,

50:35.515 --> 50:36.916
Unable to escape from it.

50:41.755 --> 50:43.689
- I almost lost her.

50:45.792 --> 50:47.827
(birds chirping)

50:56.603 --> 50:57.770
(sighing)

51:05.579 --> 51:07.680
Check in on taylor
every 10 minutes

51:07.714 --> 51:09.582
And call me if she wakes up.

51:09.616 --> 51:10.683
- Ok.

51:10.717 --> 51:12.918
- Eric, I'm serious.

51:12.953 --> 51:14.553
I didn't un-ground you

51:14.588 --> 51:16.756
So that you could play
video games all day.

51:16.790 --> 51:18.591
Keep an eye on your sister.

51:18.625 --> 51:20.893
- I don't want it
to happen to her either.

51:20.927 --> 51:22.928
- Thank you.
I'll be back in an hour.

51:22.963 --> 51:24.730
Oh, and your dad
might call.

51:24.765 --> 51:26.699
He left a message
on taylor's cell.

51:26.733 --> 51:27.900
Just don't say anything.

51:27.934 --> 51:30.703
I haven't figured out
what I'm gonna tell him.

51:30.737 --> 51:32.905
- Ok. Where you going?

51:32.939 --> 51:36.675
- I'm gonna find out
who that james is.

51:51.925 --> 51:53.526
(gasps)

51:53.560 --> 51:56.595
- You're such an ass, scott.

51:56.630 --> 51:58.798
Such an ass.

52:03.537 --> 52:05.538
(sighing)

52:05.572 --> 52:07.840
- (kris): Thank you for
letting me come over.

52:07.874 --> 52:11.477
- I'm really sorry taylor's
having such a hard time.

52:11.511 --> 52:13.779
You know, the way they're
all ganging up on her,

52:13.814 --> 52:15.481
It's pretty rough stuff.

52:15.515 --> 52:16.916
(beeping)

52:16.950 --> 52:18.551
- It's gone.

52:18.585 --> 52:21.587
James's profile,
it was here yesterday,

52:21.621 --> 52:23.622
And now it's deleted.

52:23.657 --> 52:26.559
- I should've printed it out
when I had the chance.

52:27.561 --> 52:28.894
(sighing)

52:28.929 --> 52:31.597
- Does taylor hate me?

52:32.899 --> 52:35.501
- Of course not, cheyenne.

52:37.537 --> 52:41.640
Do you think that this
james person could be a fake?

52:41.675 --> 52:45.578
- Well, his profile says that he
goes to ridgeway and he doesn't.

52:45.612 --> 52:48.781
- Do you have any idea who
could've created this profile?

52:50.917 --> 52:52.885
(sighing)

52:57.791 --> 52:59.792
(doorbell ringing)

53:03.597 --> 53:05.564
- Can I help you?

53:05.599 --> 53:06.899
- Uh, mr. Fordyce,

53:06.933 --> 53:08.534
Lindsay's father?

53:08.568 --> 53:09.802
- Yes, I am.
What's this about?

53:09.836 --> 53:11.670
- Our daughters go
to school together

53:11.705 --> 53:14.640
And I was wondering if I could
speak to you and your wife

53:14.674 --> 53:16.642
About some things
that have been happening.

53:16.676 --> 53:18.611
- My wife passed away
a few years ago,

53:18.645 --> 53:19.879
So you'll have
to deal with me.

53:19.913 --> 53:21.580
- I heard my name.

53:21.615 --> 53:24.850
- I'm taylor's mother
and I was just wondering

53:24.885 --> 53:27.620
If you created
a fake profile online.

53:27.654 --> 53:29.755
- What? No!
- Lindsay, go back inside.

53:29.789 --> 53:33.926
- You and your friends have been
harassing my daughter for weeks.

53:33.960 --> 53:35.895
My daughter tried
to commit suicide

53:35.929 --> 53:38.464
Because your daughter
was bullying her.

53:38.498 --> 53:40.666
- You should know you're
speaking with an attorney

53:40.700 --> 53:42.434
Before you slander
my daughter.

53:42.469 --> 53:43.736
- It's not slander.
It's fact.

53:43.770 --> 53:46.639
- I have posts from lindsayluv,
your daughter, mocking taylor.

53:46.673 --> 53:49.742
- If my daughter expressed
her opinion about anything--

53:49.776 --> 53:52.544
- Demeaning,
insulting opinions.

53:52.579 --> 53:55.447
- That's her right, at least
according to the constitution.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.717
- Excuse me? You're going
to defend her?

53:58.752 --> 54:00.619
- It's called
freedom of speech.

54:00.654 --> 54:01.820
It's the first amendment.

54:01.855 --> 54:03.923
You might want
to give it a read.

54:07.928 --> 54:09.728
(scoffing)

54:13.600 --> 54:15.801
(footsteps)

54:21.875 --> 54:24.810
- Why are you staring at me?

54:24.844 --> 54:27.613
- Mom said I have to call her
when you wake up.

54:27.647 --> 54:29.882
- No, you don't have
to call her.

54:31.551 --> 54:33.852
But you do have to get me
that water over there.

54:41.761 --> 54:43.495
(sighing)

54:57.477 --> 54:59.511
- Were you really
gonna do it?

55:04.684 --> 55:07.553
I would've been mad
if you did.

55:09.723 --> 55:12.658
- No, you would've loved
being an only child.

55:12.692 --> 55:14.660
- No, I wouldn't!

55:14.694 --> 55:16.528
If you hadn't
put that video up,

55:16.563 --> 55:18.697
I could've been
the one finding you all...

55:19.899 --> 55:21.667
Dead in the bathroom, you know?

55:21.701 --> 55:24.536
- God, I bet they're saying
all kinds of things about me.

55:24.571 --> 55:27.506
Eric, go get the laptop. I have
to see what they're saying.

55:28.508 --> 55:30.476
Fine, I'll get it.

55:30.510 --> 55:32.644
- No, it's fine.
I got it, I got it.

55:36.516 --> 55:37.750

55:38.785 --> 55:40.452

55:44.691 --> 55:46.692

56:01.508 --> 56:04.576
- Do you really think
that's a good idea?

56:30.553 --> 56:31.620

56:31.654 --> 56:34.256
- I don't know why
you're making me do this.

56:34.290 --> 56:35.691
- This isn't
a punishment, taylor.

56:35.725 --> 56:38.494
It's a support group,
a place to help you talk about

56:38.528 --> 56:39.628
What you've been through.

56:39.662 --> 56:41.430
- I don't want
to talk about it.

56:41.464 --> 56:43.632
- Then don't talk about it.
Just go and listen.

56:43.666 --> 56:46.235
We can't pretend that
this didn't happen!

56:46.269 --> 56:47.536
It happened and you need help!

56:47.570 --> 56:50.339
And there's nothing wrong
with asking for help!

56:53.576 --> 56:57.346
It's really hard to see you
in this much pain.

56:59.249 --> 57:02.317

you're gonna try this again!

57:03.586 --> 57:06.321
You've put so much
into your life.

57:06.356 --> 57:08.357
Your life is
so precious.

57:09.692 --> 57:11.693
(sighing)

57:16.399 --> 57:17.666
Please.

57:17.700 --> 57:19.535
- Fine. Ok, I'm going.

57:26.643 --> 57:28.577
(crying)

57:42.459 --> 57:45.194
(sobbing)

57:47.197 --> 57:49.398
- Um, before we had
to stop, unfortunately,

57:49.432 --> 57:51.400
We interrupted your story, kate.

57:51.434 --> 57:52.634
Then we're gonna talk--

57:54.404 --> 57:56.338
Oh, taylor!

57:56.372 --> 57:58.240
Glad you
could make it.

57:58.274 --> 57:59.575
Come, sit down.

58:13.590 --> 58:15.390
- Uh...

58:16.593 --> 58:18.360
Ok.

58:19.362 --> 58:20.529
Awkward.

58:24.667 --> 58:27.469
- I printed out what
these kids are saying to her.

58:27.504 --> 58:30.639
They're calling her terrible
names and saying she has stds.

58:30.673 --> 58:32.574
- Has she been
physically threatened?

58:32.609 --> 58:34.343
I can do something about that.

58:34.377 --> 58:35.511
- They're calling her dirty

58:35.545 --> 58:38.180
And saying she's sleeping
with boys for money.

58:38.214 --> 58:39.348
Isn't that harassment?

58:39.382 --> 58:41.250
- If they said it
to her face, yes,

58:41.284 --> 58:44.152
But online, there's no law
against that in this state.

58:44.187 --> 58:46.221
Other states have laws
that are particular

58:46.256 --> 58:47.556
To the internet,
but not this one.

58:47.590 --> 58:49.591
- How can that be?
I'm trying to get help.

58:49.626 --> 58:51.460
I've gone to the school,
school board

58:51.494 --> 58:54.463
And door after door keeps
getting slammed in my face.

58:54.497 --> 58:57.165
- It's not that
I don't want to help you,

58:57.200 --> 58:58.500
But unless a law is broken...

58:58.535 --> 59:00.302
I can only enforce the laws,

59:00.336 --> 59:02.170
I can't write them.

59:02.205 --> 59:04.506
- In elementary school,
it was like:

59:04.541 --> 59:07.543
"hey, there goes jelly donut"
you know, stuff like that.

59:07.577 --> 59:09.244
And it sucked, right?

59:09.279 --> 59:13.248
But at least I could go home
to get some peace.

59:13.283 --> 59:16.652
Now, it's like I can't even post
pictures on my own profile

59:16.686 --> 59:19.187
'cause people are
gonna be telling me

59:19.222 --> 59:21.557
How fat or disgusting I am.

59:22.625 --> 59:24.693
This stuff follows me home.

59:25.695 --> 59:26.662
(sighing)

59:26.696 --> 59:28.664
- I hate that.

59:30.500 --> 59:35.604
But the worst is when people
resend stuff you said to them.

59:39.576 --> 59:42.611
There was
this guy I liked.

59:44.314 --> 59:46.315
I thought he liked me.

59:47.350 --> 59:49.384
He really didn't.

59:51.254 --> 59:57.159
But I told him
personal stuff, and...

59:57.193 --> 59:59.561
And he sent it to
a bunch of people.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.599
And now at school,
there's this bunch of guys,

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:08.303
And they act out the stuff
I said right in front of me.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.439
They call it
the gay-boy show.

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.207
(scoffing)

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.513
No, wait.
That's not the worst.

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:20.215
You were right.

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.517
The worst is when
it goes home with you.

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:24.453
And they pile on
and pile on

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:28.190
And you think: "I don't even
know who that person is.

01:00:28.224 --> 01:00:31.259
"how can he say that
he despises that I exist?"

01:00:35.398 --> 01:00:36.665
- Caleb,
I'm really sorry.

01:00:36.699 --> 01:00:39.334
You told me people
were picking on you,

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:42.337
And I didn't say anything
and I'm really sorry.

01:00:44.641 --> 01:00:47.576
- You should post crap
about those guys too.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:50.345
You know,
that's what I'd do.

01:00:50.380 --> 01:00:53.582
It's not about getting mad.
It's getting even.

01:00:53.616 --> 01:00:57.219
- Well, that's one option.
Become the bully yourself.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:01:01.323
Right? How many of you
have ever decided to get even,

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.658
Posted mean comments online

01:01:02.692 --> 01:01:05.527
About someone you felt
was being mean to you.

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:14.569
No one else?

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:17.606
You never called
someone a name online

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.542
Or said they were
stupid or ugly?

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:29.718
- I called lindsay
fordyce a bitch.

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.230
(car honking)

01:01:42.265 --> 01:01:43.598
- Thank you.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.307
Scott!
- Hey.

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:55.243
- You must be feeling really
happy with yourself.

01:01:55.278 --> 01:01:58.346
Is your ego all puffed up
and feeling good?

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:00.315
- Excuse me?

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:01.650
- I'm taylor's
best friend.

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:05.387
I was sitting there when you
invited her to the spring fling.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:06.655
- So you're gonna blame me

01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:09.357
Because she had some
sort of mondo meltdown?

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.426
- Like you even
care about her!

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:14.262
- Wait. Wait.

01:02:15.264 --> 01:02:16.665
So, is she doing ok?

01:02:16.699 --> 01:02:18.400
- Give me
a break, scott!

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:20.268
- I'm serious.
I wanna know.

01:02:20.303 --> 01:02:21.536
I actually really
did like her.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.305
- Right.

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.639
- You don't give
a crap, do you?

01:02:24.674 --> 01:02:27.275
You just think
I'm an ass, which...

01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:28.276
(sighing)

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.278
...Is probably true.

01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:32.380
So why don't
you tell me, huh?

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.316
What's it like
to be so perfect

01:02:34.350 --> 01:02:36.752
That you don't have
to feel bad about anything.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:49.264
- Yeah, I got your message.

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.499
- Oh, that's good.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:53.401
- I saved the one
where you said you started

01:02:53.436 --> 01:02:55.604
To call, like,
50 times on my birthday.

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.405
- I should've just called.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.474
You know I care
about you a lot.

01:02:59.509 --> 01:03:01.376
- Yeah. Yeah, I know you care.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:02.410
- I do, really.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.414
- Well, I'll see you
in a few weeks then.

01:03:06.449 --> 01:03:08.250
-    Ok, honey.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.552
- Ok. Hey, dad, wait.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:14.289
Thanks for calling.

01:03:14.323 --> 01:03:16.324
- I'm really glad I did.

01:03:16.359 --> 01:03:17.325
Bye.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:18.560
- Bye.

01:03:18.594 --> 01:03:20.428
(beep)

01:03:22.265 --> 01:03:23.565
(chuckles)

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.374
- Here's your pill.

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:34.409
- Do I have to take it?

01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.610
- You don't want it?

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:38.180
- I don't know.
They make me so sleepy.

01:03:38.214 --> 01:03:39.447
I kind of want
to wake up.

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:42.484
- Dr. Rilke said you can stop
when you feel better.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.320
(sighing)

01:03:45.354 --> 01:03:47.389
- You've been
so nice to me.

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:50.492
I never used to think
you were nice.

01:03:50.526 --> 01:03:52.460
- What?

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.628
- I don't know.

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:56.231
I guess I just
always thought

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:58.466
You were so strict and
overprotective and mean.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.436
- And here I thought
you adored me.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:03.371
- Well, that too.

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:04.639
(laughing)

01:04:04.674 --> 01:04:07.242
- You're in a funny mood.

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:13.215
- I don't know. I just
felt so alone, you know?

01:04:13.249 --> 01:04:16.318
When all those people started
saying stuff about me,

01:04:16.352 --> 01:04:17.619
I felt like such a freak,

01:04:17.653 --> 01:04:19.654
Like I was the only one,

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.324
Like there had to be
something wrong with me

01:04:22.358 --> 01:04:23.658
For them to do that.

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:28.396
But today, I found out this
happens to a lot of people,

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.432
Like, these really
normal people.

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:34.502
I don't know.
I wish I'd known that.

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.540
I wish I'd known
you weren't against me.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:41.343
- Oh, taylor!

01:04:42.345 --> 01:04:43.411
(sighing)

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:46.481
- I should've talked to you.
I don't know why I didn't.

01:04:46.515 --> 01:04:48.617
I'm sorry.
I should've talked to you.

01:04:48.651 --> 01:04:50.652
- I made it hard
to talk to me.

01:04:50.686 --> 01:04:52.554
I was so busy telling
you what to do

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.623
That I wasn't listening
to how you felt.

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:59.427
I'm sorry you thought
that I was against you.

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:01.296
I would never be against you.

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.664
- I know.

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:04.633
(sighing)

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:06.201
- I love you so much.

01:05:06.235 --> 01:05:07.402
- I love you too.

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.504
(both sighing)

01:05:09.538 --> 01:05:12.274
I'm glad I'm not dead.

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:13.608
(sniffling)

01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.377
- Me too.

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:17.512
(beeping)

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.381
- Was that my phone?

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:21.283
- Oh, it's in my purse.

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.424
Oh, it's samantha.

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.293
- Ok.

01:05:32.428 --> 01:05:34.296
Thanks.

01:05:46.375 --> 01:05:47.642
Hey!

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.445
Come inside.

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.381
- I can't.

01:05:54.383 --> 01:05:55.550
- Why not?

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:59.287
- Because you're gonna hate me
after I tell you this.

01:06:01.223 --> 01:06:02.624
- You're scaring me.

01:06:02.658 --> 01:06:04.592
- I don't know how
to tell you this,

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:06.294
So I'm just gonna say it.

01:06:08.497 --> 01:06:11.666
I'm the one who created
the james profile...

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:16.371
I pretended to be him.
I talked to you.

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:19.407
Told everybody
you gave him an std.

01:06:23.512 --> 01:06:25.313
- I know you're lying.

01:06:27.616 --> 01:06:29.217
You wouldn't do that.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:30.385
- I did.

01:06:32.421 --> 01:06:35.290
I really wish I hadn't,
but I did.

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:37.592
I'm sorry.

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:41.663
I'm really sorry, taylor.

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.633
(sighing)

01:07:22.021 --> 01:07:24.022
Monday...
Get in
(birds chirping)

01:07:29.962 --> 01:07:31.763
(sniffling)

01:07:33.766 --> 01:07:34.999
- Samantha?

01:07:35.034 --> 01:07:37.736
What is it?
What's going on?

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:39.003
(crying)

01:07:39.038 --> 01:07:41.606
- I did something
really bad, mom.

01:07:43.042 --> 01:07:44.876
And worse...

01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:48.813
Now everybody knows.

01:07:52.918 --> 01:07:54.953
- Yeah, I mean,
I guess I'm feeling better,

01:07:54.987 --> 01:07:56.855
But I haven't been
going to school.

01:07:56.889 --> 01:07:59.891
And I know I'll eventually have
to go back and face everyone

01:07:59.925 --> 01:08:00.892
And that scares me.

01:08:00.926 --> 01:08:03.895
Hey, if I can do it,
you can do it.

01:08:03.929 --> 01:08:06.931
- But I feel like I can't go
back until I go online

01:08:06.966 --> 01:08:08.833
And I don't know
if I can handle that.

01:08:08.868 --> 01:08:09.968
I think it's gonna be bad.

01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:10.969
(crying)

01:08:11.003 --> 01:08:12.670
- It's ok.

01:08:12.705 --> 01:08:14.639
(sniffling)

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:17.809
Hon...

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:18.810
- Mm-hmm?

01:08:18.844 --> 01:08:20.812
- It is gonna
get better, ok?

01:08:20.845 --> 01:08:22.680
(sniffling)

01:08:25.951 --> 01:08:28.620
- I'm fine.
Thank you.

01:08:28.654 --> 01:08:29.821
- Ok.

01:08:32.825 --> 01:08:34.692
(sniffling)

01:08:47.872 --> 01:08:49.607
(beep)

01:08:51.844 --> 01:08:53.678
(beeping)

01:08:56.582 --> 01:09:00.018
- This seems like a good time to
talk about how to handle it

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:03.755
When you run into unpleasant
comments about you online.

01:09:03.788 --> 01:09:06.858
- You mean, besides getting
even, going all bully on them?

01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:10.595
- Which only adds fuel to the
fire, makes everything worse.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.072
(crying)

01:09:24.609 --> 01:09:26.010
(sighing)

01:09:33.685 --> 01:09:35.587
- (taylor):
I don't know what to do

01:09:35.621 --> 01:09:36.654
When I read that stuff.

01:09:36.689 --> 01:09:37.721
I just fall apart.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:39.756
- It's fine to fall apart

01:09:39.792 --> 01:09:40.758
For a little while.

01:09:40.792 --> 01:09:42.760
It's fine to acknowledge
that it hurts.

01:09:42.795 --> 01:09:45.763
But there are things that
you can do, that you should do.

01:09:45.798 --> 01:09:47.799
- Like print out everything?
- Yes.

01:09:47.832 --> 01:09:50.868
- You see something negative
about you, print it out.

01:09:50.903 --> 01:09:52.604
Save the evidence.
What else?

01:09:52.638 --> 01:09:55.540
- Block 'em. You know,
block the sender.

01:09:55.574 --> 01:09:56.908
You know, you don't wanna see

01:09:56.942 --> 01:09:59.944
What crap they're
saying about you.

01:09:59.979 --> 01:10:01.946
Took me for damn ever
to figure that out.

01:10:01.981 --> 01:10:04.883
- God, I never thought of that.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:06.718
(beeping)

01:10:13.759 --> 01:10:16.694
-    Now, there's one
more thing you can do.

01:10:16.729 --> 01:10:18.730
Probably the most
important thing.

01:10:18.764 --> 01:10:20.698
Anyone?

01:10:20.733 --> 01:10:22.734
- Speak up, man.
Tell someone.

01:10:22.768 --> 01:10:24.802
- Exactly.
- Tell who? Your mom?

01:10:24.837 --> 01:10:27.872
My mom kind of knew, although
I did kind of hide it from her.

01:10:27.907 --> 01:10:30.742
- Sure, start with your parents,
but don't stop there.

01:10:30.776 --> 01:10:33.778
- Your favourite teacher,
your principal. I don't know.

01:10:33.812 --> 01:10:35.046
- You can report it to

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.981
The bully's internet
service provider.

01:10:37.016 --> 01:10:39.751
Sometimes they'll shut down
the bully's account.

01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:40.752
- You're kidding.

01:10:40.786 --> 01:10:42.620
- Cyberbullies keep going

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:44.889
Because they think no one
will do anything about it.

01:10:44.924 --> 01:10:46.991
But if you call
attention to it,

01:10:47.026 --> 01:10:50.862
There's a chance you can stop it
from spiralling out of control.

01:10:50.896 --> 01:10:53.865
- But you can't totally stop it.
- Don't know unless you try.

01:10:54.867 --> 01:10:57.001
Don't hide behind your fear.

01:10:57.036 --> 01:10:59.938
Do what it takes
to stand up for yourself

01:10:59.972 --> 01:11:01.639
And for each other.

01:11:05.811 --> 01:11:06.911
(car honking)

01:11:06.946 --> 01:11:09.747
- I've looked into it, and most
states have passed laws

01:11:09.782 --> 01:11:11.082
Against harassment
on the internet.

01:11:11.116 --> 01:11:13.885
Remember tina meier?
Her daughter committed suicide.

01:11:13.919 --> 01:11:15.853
- I remember that.
How tragic. Tragic.

01:11:15.888 --> 01:11:17.755
- After that, missouri
passed a law.

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.058
I mean, do we have to wait
for somebody to die first?

01:11:20.092 --> 01:11:21.793
Couldn't you
introduce a bill?

01:11:21.827 --> 01:11:23.995
- I don't want to try to
legislate the internet.

01:11:24.029 --> 01:11:26.030
I don't go online myself
if I can help it.

01:11:26.065 --> 01:11:27.665
My staff does
that for me.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.867
- But these kids are
on the internet all the time.

01:11:29.902 --> 01:11:31.803
And they're vulnerable
to these bullies

01:11:31.837 --> 01:11:33.805
That are hiding
behind anonymous usernames.

01:11:33.839 --> 01:11:35.940
- But no one's making them
go online, are they?

01:11:35.975 --> 01:11:37.575
- Excuse me?

01:11:37.609 --> 01:11:39.577
- They do have delete
buttons on computers.

01:11:39.611 --> 01:11:41.846
- I thought that too until
I almost lost my daughter.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.849
You can't keep these kids off
the internet. It's their world.

01:11:44.883 --> 01:11:46.050
If you can't
understand that,

01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:48.052
Maybe somebody on
your staff could help me.

01:11:48.087 --> 01:11:49.921
- I can't allocate
man-hours to that

01:11:49.955 --> 01:11:51.656
In a middle of
a budget wrangle.

01:11:51.690 --> 01:11:53.825
Why don't you try me
again next session?

01:11:53.859 --> 01:11:55.960
Thanks so much
for coming in.

01:11:55.995 --> 01:11:57.762
(sighing)

01:11:59.965 --> 01:12:02.033
(siren in distance)

01:12:03.936 --> 01:12:04.936
(car honking)

01:12:12.011 --> 01:12:14.879
- (man):
Take the fries off...

01:12:22.921 --> 01:12:24.055
- You good?

01:12:27.826 --> 01:12:31.129
- I hope you don't think it's
weird that I came here.

01:12:32.965 --> 01:12:34.732
- I don't know
if it is or not.

01:12:34.767 --> 01:12:37.702
Why are you here? Because
if it's about the dance--

01:12:37.736 --> 01:12:39.570
- No, it's not
about the dance.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.906
- I'm sorry anyway
for ditching you like that.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:43.674
- It's ok. Thanks.

01:12:43.709 --> 01:12:44.942
(chuckling)

01:12:44.977 --> 01:12:47.045
Look, I'm here because...

01:12:47.079 --> 01:12:48.813
(sighing)

01:12:48.847 --> 01:12:51.049
I just wanna know if...

01:12:51.083 --> 01:12:53.017
(chuckling)

01:12:53.052 --> 01:12:55.053
Did you see the video
that I posted?

01:12:55.087 --> 01:12:56.954
(chuckling)

01:12:56.989 --> 01:12:59.057
- Well, yeah.
Everyone saw it.

01:12:59.091 --> 01:13:01.993
- Yeah, I just wanna
make sure you know that

01:13:02.027 --> 01:13:04.028
That was not because--

01:13:04.063 --> 01:13:05.897
- Because of me?
- Yeah.

01:13:05.931 --> 01:13:08.733
- I mean, yeah,
I thought that at first

01:13:08.767 --> 01:13:10.701
And it was, like, too much.

01:13:10.736 --> 01:13:12.003
It freaked me out.

01:13:12.037 --> 01:13:14.005
- Oh my god! It was not
because of you.

01:13:14.039 --> 01:13:17.642
- I know. Even my mom was like:
"dude, check your ego.

01:13:17.676 --> 01:13:19.677
"there's a lot more
going on here."

01:13:20.879 --> 01:13:23.915
- Yeah. There was
a lot going on.

01:13:25.784 --> 01:13:28.086
- All that crap
coming down on you online.

01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.921
- Yeah, it was really bad.

01:13:29.955 --> 01:13:32.957
- I see that kind of thing
happen all the time

01:13:32.991 --> 01:13:34.759
And I never say anything,

01:13:34.793 --> 01:13:38.830
And then I saw it happen to you
and it made me feel sick, but...

01:13:38.864 --> 01:13:39.831
(chuckling)

01:13:39.865 --> 01:13:41.666
I still didn't say anything.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.634
And I really wanted to.
I just--

01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:45.036
I don't know.

01:13:46.939 --> 01:13:51.008
I'm really sorry
that it got so bad for you.

01:13:51.043 --> 01:13:53.711
- That's really nice to hear.
Thank you.

01:13:53.745 --> 01:13:55.012
- Yeah, well,
it's wrong.

01:13:55.047 --> 01:13:58.015
What lindsay and her stupid
friends were doing to you,

01:13:58.050 --> 01:14:00.685
It's not right that
they get away with it.

01:14:02.020 --> 01:14:03.688
- Yeah.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:06.724
- Mmm!

01:14:06.758 --> 01:14:07.792
(phone beeps)

01:14:07.826 --> 01:14:10.728
There you are.
I was worried about you.

01:14:10.762 --> 01:14:12.597
You ok?

01:14:12.631 --> 01:14:16.033
- I don't want us to give up
on trying to get a law passed.

01:14:16.068 --> 01:14:18.903
- Well, we can always try
and find a new senator.

01:14:18.937 --> 01:14:21.606
- No, I wanna try
something else.

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.008
Dr. Rilke says we have
to call attention to it.

01:14:24.042 --> 01:14:25.943
So I wanna call
attention to it.

01:14:25.978 --> 01:14:27.945
- Are you sure that's
what you wanna do?

01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.748
- Someone's gotta do
something about this.

01:14:36.855 --> 01:14:38.122
"ugly," "loser," "stupid"--
- yeah, a jpeg
will do. Uh-huh.

01:14:38.157 --> 01:14:39.957
Words can hurt.

01:14:39.992 --> 01:14:42.059
If you or someone you know
has been the victim of bullying,

01:14:42.094 --> 01:14:44.095
Call the stomp out bullying
help line

01:14:44.129 --> 01:14:46.063
Or go to stompoutbullying.Org.

01:14:46.098 --> 01:14:47.965
It's time your voice is heard.

Stop the bullying.
Speak up.

01:15:00.462 --> 01:15:01.796
St email it to me.

01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:03.764
Ok, thanks.

01:15:04.867 --> 01:15:07.568
Sorry. I spend
more time chasing photos

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:09.470
Than I do writing the story.

01:15:09.505 --> 01:15:11.806
Ok. So where were we?

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.409
- We were talking about how,
um, kids are getting hurt

01:15:15.444 --> 01:15:18.513
And adults can't see it
because it's happening online.

01:15:18.547 --> 01:15:20.615
- And the government
isn't doing anything,

01:15:20.649 --> 01:15:22.617
So we need public pressure.

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:24.385
- I won't argue that.

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:27.755
But as far as your story goes,
well, it's not news.

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:31.425
I doubt my editor will
let me run with it.

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:32.727
Although...

01:15:32.761 --> 01:15:35.630
You said your friend samantha
made a fake identity

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:38.399
And posted things about you
that weren't true?

01:15:38.433 --> 01:15:39.800
- Yeah.

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:41.836
- Now that could be
an interesting angle.

01:15:41.870 --> 01:15:45.840
I do an interview with
the bully and the bullied.

01:15:45.874 --> 01:15:47.542
Think she'd talk to me?

01:15:47.576 --> 01:15:48.876
- Uh, no. Why would she?

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:51.646
- Lots of people don't wanna
talk to me, but lots do.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:53.447
Why don't you
give me her number?

01:15:53.482 --> 01:15:55.416
I'll give her a call,
invite her down.

01:15:55.450 --> 01:15:56.617
She might just
go for it.

01:15:56.652 --> 01:15:59.787
- Uh, I don't think
she'd wanna talk about it.

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:03.824
- Um, here's
her mother's number.

01:16:03.859 --> 01:16:06.360
Um, her name
is karen caldone.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.596
Samantha may be
leaving for school.

01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.534
(sighs)

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.703
- Why did you do that?

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:17.772
- I'm sorry. I should
have asked you first.

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:20.675
- You know, she's gonna think
I'm after her, and I'm not.

01:16:20.709 --> 01:16:23.611
- Honey, it's not
a bad idea for samantha

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:26.480
To face the consequences
of her actions.

01:16:26.515 --> 01:16:27.848
- Yeah, but not
like this.

01:16:29.484 --> 01:16:32.520
- Her mother said
samantha agreed to do it.

01:16:32.554 --> 01:16:34.555
They'll be here
in half an hour.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.661
(phone ringing)

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:45.833
(door opens)

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:46.901
Go on in.

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:50.738
- Hey.

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:52.740
- Samantha, you can
sit by taylor.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.642
We want you
sitting together

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.745
So we can take a few shots
while we talk, ok?

01:17:00.582 --> 01:17:02.683
All right, samantha.

01:17:02.718 --> 01:17:04.619
Taylor told me
a pretty wild story

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.354
That you, her best friend,

01:17:06.388 --> 01:17:08.789
Tricked her into believing
you were someone else online.

01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.525
And then as that
alternate person,

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:15.496
You spread rumours about her
in an online community.

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:17.732
Is that true?

01:17:17.766 --> 01:17:19.533
- Yes.

01:17:19.568 --> 01:17:20.735
(clears throat)

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:23.638
- She didn't think
you'd wanna admit it.

01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:26.741
- Yeah. Why are
you doing this?

01:17:28.844 --> 01:17:30.711
- I hate what I did,

01:17:30.746 --> 01:17:34.582
But I'm not gonna
pretend I didn't do it.

01:17:34.616 --> 01:17:36.751
- Well, why?
You pretended just fine before.

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:39.687
- It sounds like you're
still pretty upset at her.

01:17:41.456 --> 01:17:43.691
- She has every right
to still be mad.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.894
What I did was horrible.

01:17:48.530 --> 01:17:51.732
And I've never been more
sorry in my entire life.

01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:56.604
- Well, why do it then?

01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:59.807
- I had reasons that
made sense at the time.

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:04.412
I thought I was
protecting her from a guy.

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:10.551
I was hurt, angry...

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:12.453
I don't know, jealous.

01:18:12.487 --> 01:18:15.756
But the reasons didn't matter
once I'd realized I'd hurt her.

01:18:19.628 --> 01:18:21.595
- So what was going
on through your mind

01:18:21.630 --> 01:18:23.831
When you were doing it,
the cyberbullying?

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:29.503
- It's hard to picture
myself like that.

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.506
You know, I'd always
thought of bullies

01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:35.443
As people at school
who pick on you.

01:18:37.813 --> 01:18:39.513
But when you
do it online,

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:41.816
You don't even realize
that you're doing it.

01:18:42.884 --> 01:18:45.586
You can't see
the other people.

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:49.457
And--and you can
do or say anything

01:18:49.491 --> 01:18:52.560
And it doesn't
seem to matter.

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:56.630
It doesn't feel real.

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:04.438
But it's real when you're
the one getting bullied.

01:19:04.473 --> 01:19:06.607
I know because everyone's
turned on me now.

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:10.611
And, taylor,
I am so sorry

01:19:10.645 --> 01:19:12.747
That I ever made
you feel anything--

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.415
- Wait...

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.718
Lindsay and them,
they're after you now?

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:18.819
I didn't know that.

01:19:20.555 --> 01:19:21.789
- It doesn't matter.

01:19:22.791 --> 01:19:24.525
I deserve it.

01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.661
- No, you don't.

01:19:29.598 --> 01:19:31.465
(camera clicking)

01:19:52.587 --> 01:19:54.388
- Taylor?

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.423
I hope this can
be the first step

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:57.658
For you and samantha to--

01:19:57.692 --> 01:20:00.461
- Mom, please,
let's just go.

01:20:01.596 --> 01:20:03.564
(horn honks)

01:20:03.598 --> 01:20:05.399
- Hey, samantha, wait.

01:20:10.839 --> 01:20:12.807
Thanks for doing this.

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:16.610
They--they wouldn't have run
the story unless you did it too.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:17.812
- It's fine.

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:19.680
- If it's happening
to you now,

01:20:19.714 --> 01:20:22.416
They have support groups
for that kind of thing,

01:20:22.450 --> 01:20:24.485
And it's actually
really been helping me.

01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:26.754
- Thanks.

01:20:27.756 --> 01:20:30.391
I'll think about it.

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:38.532
- I think that went
really well, don't you?

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.738
- I'm ready to
go back to school.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.408
- Hmm!

01:20:47.442 --> 01:20:48.576
Mmm...

01:20:53.582 --> 01:20:54.548
- Thank you.

01:20:54.583 --> 01:20:55.616
- Thank you.

01:20:55.650 --> 01:20:56.851
I wish I could go in.

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:59.753
Go to class with you,
go to lunch with you...

01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:01.755
- I'm gonna be fine.

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.757
All this group
has been saying

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:06.694
Is how I can't let them
have power over me anymore.

01:21:06.728 --> 01:21:09.396
So that's what
I'm gonna do.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:10.831
- When did you
get all grown-up?

01:21:11.867 --> 01:21:13.434
(sighs)

01:21:13.468 --> 01:21:15.569
- (girl): Oh my god!
Are you serious?

01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:16.770
- I better go.

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:21.609
Bye.

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:22.743
- Bye.

01:21:23.845 --> 01:21:25.713
(boy laughing)

01:21:53.875 --> 01:21:55.576
- Hey.

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:59.613
I didn't know you'd
be coming back today.

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:01.815
- Yeah, I didn't either.

01:22:09.591 --> 01:22:11.592
Maybe we can
sit together.

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:13.827
- You really want to?

01:22:16.498 --> 01:22:18.832
- I don't know if we can ever
be friends in the same way,

01:22:18.867 --> 01:22:20.467
But I'm willing to try.

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:26.440
- I've really missed you.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.680
- Well, let's go in then.

01:22:36.584 --> 01:22:38.619
- (girl):
Hey, over here!

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:49.630
- Oh, look,
it's the psycho twins.

01:22:49.664 --> 01:22:51.498
- Just ignore her.

01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:53.867
(girl laughing)

01:22:53.902 --> 01:22:56.670
- No, I'm not gonna
ignore it anymore.

01:22:58.406 --> 01:22:59.473
Hey, lindsay?

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:02.743
I know you think
you're being funny,

01:23:02.777 --> 01:23:04.812
But you should know
your words actually hurt.

01:23:04.846 --> 01:23:08.382
And I think you should stop
attacking people online.

01:23:08.416 --> 01:23:10.417
(laughing, yowls)

01:23:10.452 --> 01:23:11.585
- Get her, linds.

01:23:11.619 --> 01:23:13.620
- No, she's right.
You guys should stop.

01:23:13.655 --> 01:23:16.657
You're making everyone
around you miserable.

01:23:16.691 --> 01:23:19.660
- Aw, the twins are
sticking up for each other.

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.495
How cute.

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:23.630
- Yeah, because that's
what friends do.

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.799
- Stop attacking people
on cliquesters.

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.635
You're making it so no one
wants to go on there anymore.

01:23:28.670 --> 01:23:30.838
- Yeah, you seem to me
just like any other bully,

01:23:30.872 --> 01:23:32.773
Spreading hate
wherever you go.

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.842
- (boy 1): Oh!
- (boy 2): Yeah, man.

01:23:34.876 --> 01:23:38.445
- I've gotta say, the way that
you guys need to hurt people,

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.781
Maybe you need to talk
to someone and get some help.

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.850
(applause and cheering)

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.527
- Get out of
my face, losers.

01:23:54.829 --> 01:23:56.563
(laughter)

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.433
- (boy 3):
Get out of here!

01:23:59.467 --> 01:24:01.535
- Ok, I've dreamed about
something like that

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:02.703
Only a hundred times.

01:24:02.737 --> 01:24:05.439
Hope it was good
for you, taylor,

01:24:05.473 --> 01:24:07.441
'cause it was
awesome for me.

01:24:07.475 --> 01:24:08.876
- Yeah.

01:24:15.884 --> 01:24:18.752
- Well, you finally stood up.

01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:21.789
- I'm sorry I took
so long. I just...

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:24.425
You know, things
got so intense and--

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:26.460
- It's ok. I know.

01:24:26.494 --> 01:24:27.828
- I'm sorry.

01:24:30.432 --> 01:24:32.666
- Well, I am starving.
Let's go get some food.

01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.401
- Hey.
- I'm sorry.

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:35.536
- It's ok.

01:24:40.842 --> 01:24:42.910
So you said
something this time.

01:24:43.912 --> 01:24:46.513
- You were inspiring.
I was impressed.

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:49.450
- Really? 'cause I think
I'm still shaking.

01:24:50.652 --> 01:24:51.885
- I'm really
glad you're back.

01:24:52.887 --> 01:24:54.788
- Me too.

01:24:54.823 --> 01:24:58.392
- So, could I maybe sit
and eat lunch with you?

01:25:00.428 --> 01:25:02.496
Maybe I can be the one
who gets the ketchup.

01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:04.398
- Yeah, I think
I'd like that.

01:25:04.432 --> 01:25:07.534
shooting over stars 

01:25:08.803 --> 01:25:11.371
this is your life... 

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:12.773
(phone ringing)

01:25:14.576 --> 01:25:15.709
- This is kris.

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:17.611
- Hi. Terry dunley,
down at the paper.

01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:18.846
I just wanted to tell you

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.582
That I called sen. Evans
to get a comment from him

01:25:21.616 --> 01:25:24.518
About shooting you down on
sponsoring the cyberbully bill.

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:26.453
- Oh, really?
-    Oh, yes.

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:28.755
And he said you
misunderstood him.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.558
He said his staff is already
working on a proposal

01:25:31.593 --> 01:25:32.759
To make a new law

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:34.461
That will make it illegal

01:25:34.496 --> 01:25:36.630
To harass minors online
in this state.

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:38.599
And he's talking
to the school board

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:39.733
To get their input.

01:25:39.767 --> 01:25:41.468
- That's terrific.

01:25:41.503 --> 01:25:45.706
maybe it's all
in your head 

01:25:46.708 --> 01:25:49.776
this is your life 

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:52.779
and it's all you've got 

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:56.817
it's all you've got 

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:02.689
this is your life 

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:06.527
is it what you want?
Is it what you want? 

01:26:06.561 --> 01:26:09.763
is it what you want? 

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.635
this is your life 

01:26:16.404 --> 01:26:18.705
and it's all you've got 

01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.642
it's all you've got 

01:26:23.478 --> 01:26:26.847
this is your life 

01:26:28.683 --> 01:26:31.618
is it what you want?
Is it what you want? 

01:26:31.653 --> 01:26:35.689
is it what you want? 

01:26:39.427 --> 01:26:42.329
