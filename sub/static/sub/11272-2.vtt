00:07.501 --> 00:10.372
That's it, folks. Closing it up.

00:10.547 --> 00:13.798
- Night, Coach.
- Good night, guys.

00:13.969 --> 00:18.882
- Normie, you want to get a bite to eat?
- l have a wife at home.

00:19.059 --> 00:23.308
We could stop by and pick her up.
l haven't met her yet.

00:23.481 --> 00:25.973
l don't think so. Not tonight.

00:26.153 --> 00:28.989
Wait a minute.
Are you ashamed of me or her?

00:29.157 --> 00:31.197
A little of both, l guess.

01:38.003 --> 01:40.043
Hey, everybody. l'm back.

01:40.214 --> 01:42.672
Last week on Cheers,
l, Cliff Clavin,

01:42.844 --> 01:45.252
postman and happy wanderer,

01:45.430 --> 01:49.050
returned from a vacation
in the state of Florida.

01:49.227 --> 01:51.802
lt was an invigorating experience.

01:51.981 --> 01:56.978
l'd tell you about it but certain parties
insist l fill you in on the story.

01:57.155 --> 02:00.822
Diane and Sam had
a little falling by the wayside.

02:00.994 --> 02:04.246
They went separate ways,
Sam went back to his old ones.

02:04.415 --> 02:09.495
l don't know which wagon Sam fell off,
but back to the bottle he went.

02:09.674 --> 02:13.339
Diane went what
we euphemistically call...

02:15.556 --> 02:18.130
and spent time in a country hospital.

02:18.310 --> 02:23.982
After she got out, Coach got her into
Cheers to try and talk sense into Sam.

02:24.151 --> 02:27.653
She talked him into
seeing a psychiatrist.

02:27.823 --> 02:32.202
Sam agreed, not knowing that the shrink
and Diane were dating steadily,

02:32.371 --> 02:34.828
and rumour has it, heavily.

02:35.000 --> 02:40.340
Sam is under a misconception
that Diane still carries the torch for him.

02:40.508 --> 02:44.638
Diane thinks that Sam
is the torch bearer.

02:44.806 --> 02:49.636
You know something?
l may have the wrong batch of slides.

02:49.813 --> 02:54.857
These are my snaps of FLA.
You all know how Sam and Diane look.

02:55.028 --> 02:58.778
But a lot of you haven't
seen The Sunshine State.

02:58.950 --> 03:01.075
What we're looking at here is...

03:02.079 --> 03:06.293
All right, who pulled the plug?
Very funny. Come on!

03:15.974 --> 03:20.519
You're a failure and you're gutless
because you won't admit it.

03:20.689 --> 03:23.857
You've hurt everyone
who's tried to reach you.

03:24.027 --> 03:26.816
You make me sick!

03:29.160 --> 03:32.495
Sam, tell me what's on your mind.

03:32.664 --> 03:36.878
- How much this will cost.
- You're thinking of money?

03:37.046 --> 03:42.718
Yeah, l hope it's not going to be a lot
because l get Diane to do this for free.

03:43.555 --> 03:46.641
She used to abuse me
for free all the time.

03:47.686 --> 03:51.353
Well, it wasn't exactly free.
l had to sleep with her.

03:53.694 --> 03:58.275
Beneath your flippancy l sense
a lot of hostility towards Diane.

03:58.451 --> 04:00.943
And towards myself.

04:01.121 --> 04:05.073
Look, l haven't had a drink in ten days.

04:05.253 --> 04:09.963
l've got a problem, but l'm going to AA
and l think l'm going be OK.

04:10.134 --> 04:14.715
No, you're better than OK, Sam.
You're abundantly human.

04:15.808 --> 04:17.885
You said l made you sick.

04:18.062 --> 04:21.228
l was confronting you.
Forget about that.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.486
l am telling you that
you're abundantly human.

04:24.654 --> 04:28.985
Great, l really think l'm going
be able to handle this.

04:29.160 --> 04:31.201
l don't.

04:32.665 --> 04:36.167
- l'm abundantly human, remember?
- Don't you see?

04:36.337 --> 04:39.589
l'm putting you
on an emotional pendulum.

04:39.759 --> 04:43.629
l don't want to be on anything.
l want to quit.

04:43.806 --> 04:45.847
- What?
- This is distressing.

04:46.017 --> 04:50.433
- l hear Sam ''the failure''.
- You said l was abundantly human.

04:50.608 --> 04:53.646
An abundantly human person
can change.

04:53.821 --> 04:58.069
- l want to quit, that's a change.
- You're becoming compulsive.

04:58.243 --> 05:01.578
- We should double our sessions.
- Double? Come on!

05:01.749 --> 05:04.667
- l'll be OK.
- You have progressed.

05:04.836 --> 05:09.250
- Good, let's quit.
- Sam! There's that word again.

05:09.425 --> 05:14.635
Do you realise that you keep saying it?
Could you stop if you wanted to?

05:14.808 --> 05:16.932
Frasier?

05:17.103 --> 05:21.233
l know a peaceful place in the country.
l could get you in.

05:21.401 --> 05:26.990
Lovely grounds, nice food, casual dress.
Your tie and belt will be confiscated.

05:27.159 --> 05:32.203
Frasier, l'm not going to a hospital.
l am not having any more sessions.

05:32.376 --> 05:36.623
- We're through. Get the hell out.
- Sam! We did it!

05:38.007 --> 05:40.251
- Did what?
- You're a whole person.

05:40.428 --> 05:42.717
Really, l mean that.

05:42.889 --> 05:45.216
- l am?
- You stood up to me.

05:45.393 --> 05:49.143
You no longer need to run
from problems, need to drink,

05:49.316 --> 05:54.110
or need to spend weekends
at a hospital, bombed on Thorazine.

05:54.323 --> 05:57.110
- Goodbye.
- Wait a minute.

05:57.285 --> 06:01.913
Sam, you must break this attachment.
Swim, Sam, swim.

06:02.084 --> 06:04.836
No, Frasier, no.

06:05.004 --> 06:10.630
l just want you to tell me what
you think put Diane in the ''ha ha house''.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.471
l'm not her doctor,
and if l were, l couldn't discuss it.

06:14.644 --> 06:18.262
lt doesn't matter.
She went nuts cos l kicked her out.

06:18.440 --> 06:24.065
Sam, l don't think you should use
the word ''nuts'' when discussing Diane.

06:24.240 --> 06:27.491
Well, you've met her.
Give me a better one.

06:27.661 --> 06:29.488
Bonkers.

06:33.086 --> 06:37.001
You see, you don't
need alcohol to have fun.

06:38.175 --> 06:41.925
ln my profession there's
no such thing as a closed door.

06:42.098 --> 06:44.769
That explains how Diane got out.

06:47.522 --> 06:52.815
As long as you have that humour,
you can't ever go completely astray.

06:52.989 --> 06:54.863
- Goodbye.
- So long, Doc.

06:55.032 --> 06:58.783
Hey, Frasier.
Say hello to all your loons for me.

06:58.955 --> 07:03.666
Carla, why do you build walls
between yourself and everyone else?

07:03.837 --> 07:07.124
Have you taken a good look
at everyone else?

07:07.759 --> 07:10.429
TouchÃ©.

07:10.596 --> 07:14.893
Here's to Sammy. Ten days
without the slow death of alcohol.

07:15.060 --> 07:20.354
No, don't toast me for that.
Getting back on the bottle was stupid.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.651
l was reading in an article,

07:22.822 --> 07:26.691
alcohol actually eats
huge holes in the tissue of...

07:26.869 --> 07:30.571
Some people like bartenders
who tell great stories and jokes.

07:30.750 --> 07:34.203
No, give me a good
temperance lecture any time.

07:35.506 --> 07:37.630
- l'm sorry.
- Yeah, well.

07:37.801 --> 07:40.340
l don't have an alcoholic personality.

07:40.514 --> 07:42.756
You don't have a personality.

07:43.726 --> 07:47.642
l'm going to resist hurling
a rejoinder in your direction

07:47.815 --> 07:50.687
out of the respect l bear
for members of your gender.

07:50.861 --> 07:55.572
Please make sure that's all you bare
for members of my gender.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.573
- Hello, everybody.
- Coach, come here.

08:01.585 --> 08:04.374
- l've been dreading this moment.
- Why?

08:05.381 --> 08:10.294
Diane will beg me to get back together
and l'm going to break her heart.

08:10.472 --> 08:11.884
That's terrible.

08:12.057 --> 08:16.521
No, the terrible thing is,
l'm looking forward to it.

08:17.232 --> 08:20.068
And then after being in the Everglades,

08:20.237 --> 08:25.280
Seminole lndians made me
the honorary mail carrier of the tribe.

08:27.037 --> 08:31.250
- Hi, Sam. ls Frasier here?
- No, we finished our session.

08:31.419 --> 08:34.171
He's making remarkable progress.

08:34.339 --> 08:38.505
- lt's you l want to talk to, anyway.
- Yeah, l know. l figured.

08:38.679 --> 08:42.214
You probably remember
where the office is, right?

08:42.392 --> 08:45.976
Oh, yes. l've seen it in my dreams.

08:46.148 --> 08:49.066
Coach, l'm going take a break.

08:50.237 --> 08:53.607
Hey, Coach.
Who's ''Miss God's Gift to the World?''

08:53.784 --> 08:57.913
l didn't see the show this year.
l think Miss Kansas won.

09:01.836 --> 09:04.210
Strange to be here again.

09:06.801 --> 09:11.715
- Using a new cologne?
- No, that's the roach bomb.

09:13.812 --> 09:16.481
But, you know, that's not a...

09:17.525 --> 09:20.611
Yes, well, down to business.

09:21.530 --> 09:25.364
Sam, there's something
l've been keeping from you

09:25.537 --> 09:27.613
and l've got to tell you now.

09:27.789 --> 09:32.868
There's something l need to say to you
and l think l ought to go first.

09:33.047 --> 09:35.883
No, l think maybe l should go first.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.089
Maybe.

09:45.565 --> 09:47.641
l'm over you.

09:47.818 --> 09:49.858
You're over me?

09:50.029 --> 09:54.242
- You don't think that l still...
- You've got your...

09:58.625 --> 10:01.543
- You thought l...
- Well, so did you.

10:02.797 --> 10:05.668
We keep doing it.

10:06.219 --> 10:10.349
Something we thought we'd
seen the last of is resurfacing.

10:10.516 --> 10:12.639
Yeah, my lunch.

10:30.962 --> 10:35.590
Rest assured l have
no feelings left for you. Nothing.

10:35.760 --> 10:39.462
l assure you
l feel less than nothing for you.

10:43.646 --> 10:49.153
- Then there's nothing really left to say.
- There is one thing you should know.

10:49.322 --> 10:54.234
lt's important. There's another man
in my life and he's someone you know.

10:54.411 --> 10:57.164
Really? Who?

10:57.333 --> 11:00.287
Frasier and l have been lovers
for several weeks.

11:04.843 --> 11:07.680
- What do you mean, ooh?
- l'm sorry.

11:07.847 --> 11:12.142
l just got a little mental picture.
lt took me by surprise.

11:14.147 --> 11:17.932
Well, why didn't you
say something sooner?

11:18.111 --> 11:23.108
Frasier didn't want to tell you
in case it interfered with your therapy.

11:23.285 --> 11:26.869
We had a terrible fight about it... No...

11:27.041 --> 11:29.877
we had a wonderful fight about it.

11:30.044 --> 11:36.417
Frasier says fighting can be wonderful
if you lay out the rules, share your hurt,

11:36.596 --> 11:41.141
and never lose respect for
the other's abundant humanness.

11:41.311 --> 11:44.598
Boy, you people with full lives.

11:51.700 --> 11:53.741
- Well...
- Well...

11:56.707 --> 12:00.458
Wait, a second.
Guys, l think you ought to hear this.

12:01.839 --> 12:07.429
Diane got herself a new fella.
She and Frasier Crane are lovers.

12:11.812 --> 12:14.979
- What do you mean, ooh?
- l mean...

12:15.901 --> 12:19.188
ooh...two should be very happy together.

12:23.120 --> 12:27.035
Sam, l thought you said
she was still nuts about you.

12:27.209 --> 12:30.164
l was wrong, and l'm happy to be wrong.

12:30.421 --> 12:32.249
Me too.

12:33.176 --> 12:34.421
Well...

12:37.348 --> 12:40.350
- l guess this is goodbye.
- l guess it is.

12:40.519 --> 12:44.056
What are you doing here?
l've been looking for you.

12:44.232 --> 12:46.273
l'm so glad you're here.

12:52.745 --> 12:56.613
Diane, you shared our secret
with Sam, didn't you?

12:56.792 --> 13:02.964
- Yes, and he took it wonderfully.
- ln fact, let me buy you a drink.

13:03.134 --> 13:07.549
Why, thanks, Sam.
l'll have a white wine spritzer.

13:09.059 --> 13:12.430
Well, OK. l'll have one, too.

13:12.605 --> 13:14.647
lt's our drink.

13:19.157 --> 13:24.497
- You two met in the bin, did you?
- Yes, and it isn't a ''bin''.

13:25.916 --> 13:29.287
Golden Brook is a pastoral retreat.

13:30.381 --> 13:33.418
Did you hold hands during the lobotomy?

13:35.096 --> 13:37.303
Diane, take a joke.

13:38.393 --> 13:40.516
l love you.

13:40.686 --> 13:45.267
Frasier is a consulting psychiatrist.
He wasn't my therapist.

13:45.444 --> 13:48.115
How did you two get together?

13:48.281 --> 13:51.616
l was playing croquet
one beautiful morning.

13:51.786 --> 13:56.284
lt's a game l learned during my stay
there and l got quite good at it.

13:56.460 --> 14:00.328
l saw you do that.
You are a naughty, naughty girl.

14:00.507 --> 14:04.007
- lt wasn't...
- l saw you do it. Be a grown-up.

14:04.178 --> 14:08.178
lt was amazing how l could
lose myself in the game.

14:08.351 --> 14:10.391
l'm annoyed.

14:10.563 --> 14:13.019
When playing
with someone of equal ability,

14:13.191 --> 14:18.021
it gave me an appreciation
for the nobler aspects of competition.

14:18.198 --> 14:22.909
- What is this business?
- l'm not playing with you any more!

14:23.080 --> 14:25.120
Fine, then go to...

14:25.292 --> 14:29.505
Frasier happened by in the midst
of this spirited contest

14:29.672 --> 14:32.794
and he stopped
to correct a flaw in my swing.

14:34.805 --> 14:39.184
My opponent on that day
was as crafty a strategist as l.

14:39.352 --> 14:42.438
We really brought out
the best in each other.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.401
Girls! Ladies!

14:47.573 --> 14:50.030
Frasier remained to watch my game,

14:50.201 --> 14:54.497
and to good-naturedly
arbitrate a close call for us.

14:54.666 --> 14:58.582
Under the attentive gaze
of a distinguished doctor

14:58.755 --> 15:02.173
l lost some of my concentration
on the game itself.

15:02.344 --> 15:04.384
Who's your doctor?

15:04.555 --> 15:07.925
Who would guess
a leisurely game of croquet

15:08.102 --> 15:10.391
would provide me with such a trophy?

15:10.564 --> 15:12.390
lndeed.

15:13.986 --> 15:16.524
That's quite a story.

15:16.697 --> 15:19.271
How is your romantic life going, Sam?

15:19.451 --> 15:23.950
l'm dating a girl that
l think may just turn out to be

15:24.124 --> 15:27.541
the woman l've been
waiting for all my life.

15:27.712 --> 15:29.837
Sam Malone!

15:30.007 --> 15:32.167
You went out with my sister!

15:33.303 --> 15:35.975
Did you think it wouldn't get back to me?

15:36.141 --> 15:40.140
l have had just about as much
as l can take from you!

15:40.314 --> 15:42.391
As far as l'm concerned,

15:42.567 --> 15:45.439
you never existed.

15:50.454 --> 15:53.490
Well, the search continues.

15:55.043 --> 15:57.713
Swim, Sam, swim.

15:57.880 --> 16:02.509
Great, now l have to work
another Saturday night by myself.

16:02.679 --> 16:06.428
You promised you wouldn't
boink any more waitresses...

16:06.600 --> 16:08.927
unless it was me.

16:12.151 --> 16:17.395
l'm going to have to find somebody,
who l can keep my hands off of.

16:18.325 --> 16:21.078
Are you looking for work?

16:22.164 --> 16:26.295
Thank you very much
for the very attractive offer,

16:26.462 --> 16:28.621
but l'm not interested.

16:28.799 --> 16:30.839
l understand. How silly of me.

16:31.011 --> 16:34.594
You couldn't possibly
come back to work here.

16:34.765 --> 16:38.979
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it's interesting.

16:39.188 --> 16:44.148
l mean, it doesn't bother me at all,
but it must create a problem for you.

16:47.158 --> 16:50.659
- Frasier, could we go now, please?
- Of course, dear.

16:50.829 --> 16:55.624
This is goodbye for now, but there's
no such thing as a former patient.

16:55.796 --> 16:59.841
Once you've been my patient,
l'm always there when you...

17:00.008 --> 17:03.629
Oh, great. l'll bet this is important.

17:07.603 --> 17:10.605
- Where's the phone?
- ln the hallway.

17:13.278 --> 17:16.944
- Why don't you have a seat there?
- No, thank you.

17:17.117 --> 17:19.156
l understand.

17:20.829 --> 17:22.871
What do you understand?

17:23.041 --> 17:26.210
l assume what you said in there
was the truth,

17:26.380 --> 17:30.331
but obviously you're feeling
sexual tension around me.

17:30.511 --> 17:34.130
Sitting that close
would be kind of rough on you.

17:34.308 --> 17:38.093
The fact of the matter
is l don't want to work here because

17:38.272 --> 17:41.358
l think l have a better lot in store

17:41.526 --> 17:45.478
than a life of serving beer
to squamulous laggards.

17:45.656 --> 17:49.027
Please, Diane. The man's in the room.

17:50.705 --> 17:54.076
- Tell Frasier l'm waiting outside.
- l understand.

17:54.252 --> 17:58.666
lt'd be safer to wait around the corner.
l do give off this aura.

17:58.842 --> 18:00.882
That's the roach bomb.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.137
Diane, listen. Please!

18:05.310 --> 18:08.726
l have something to say
and it's straight from here.

18:08.898 --> 18:12.897
- What is it, Coach?
- This is my heart, isn't it?

18:13.988 --> 18:15.566
Yes, it is.

18:15.741 --> 18:19.990
Diane, if you walk out that door,
he's back on the bottle.

18:22.124 --> 18:25.043
Well, l can't be responsible for that.

18:25.213 --> 18:28.583
Diane, don't tear his heart
out again, please.

18:28.759 --> 18:32.462
You'd do us both a favour
if you stick around.

18:32.639 --> 18:36.556
Just a couple or three weeks.
Just till he gets back on his feet.

18:36.729 --> 18:38.556
Please.

18:42.069 --> 18:43.897
Well...

18:44.991 --> 18:48.692
l've gone this far,
l might as well persist.

18:48.870 --> 18:50.948
She's back!

18:53.711 --> 18:56.583
lf Frasier approves, l'll stick around,

18:56.757 --> 19:00.009
and help you through
your waitress problem.

19:02.265 --> 19:06.810
Wait a second. You mean to tell me
you're coming back to work here?

19:06.980 --> 19:10.729
l'll take it until a better job comes along.

19:10.902 --> 19:14.237
Cleaning up after rodeos, for instance.

19:16.076 --> 19:20.122
- Great, Sam? Diane's back.
- Great.

19:21.041 --> 19:23.165
What did you say to her?

19:23.336 --> 19:28.712
l said she walks out that door,
she's back in that nut house in a month.

19:28.886 --> 19:30.428
l see.

19:31.723 --> 19:35.852
- You're not going to tell her, are you?
- No, of course not.

19:39.901 --> 19:43.069
Well, welcome aboard, Miss Chambers.

19:45.158 --> 19:47.910
Thank you, Mr Malone.

19:48.079 --> 19:52.790
That Coach is a pretty smart
fella sometimes, isn't he?

19:55.047 --> 19:57.540
Yes, he is, Sam.

19:58.761 --> 20:02.178
- Well, enough said about that.
- Yes, enough.

20:02.350 --> 20:07.310
- Diane, shall we be off?
- l'm going to come back to work here.

20:07.482 --> 20:09.308
What? No.

20:12.322 --> 20:17.069
As Frasier Crane, MD, l don't think
that's a good idea for the two of you.

20:17.245 --> 20:19.488
And as Frasier Crane, man,

20:19.665 --> 20:23.036
l don't think it's a good idea
for the three of us.

20:23.212 --> 20:26.878
Frasier, listen to me.
Sam needs my help in the bar.

20:29.512 --> 20:32.763
lf you feel any jealousy,
let me assure you

20:32.934 --> 20:36.933
l could work with this man
all my life and feel nothing.

20:37.107 --> 20:41.152
Work? l could live in the same
house and never be tempted.

20:42.364 --> 20:48.036
l could sleep in the same bed
and get nothing but a good night's rest.

20:48.206 --> 20:52.336
l could get out of jail after twelve years...

20:53.797 --> 20:58.045
...serve on a ship with an all-male crew
for another four,

20:58.220 --> 21:01.636
be dropped off on a desert
island for another three,

21:01.808 --> 21:04.679
eating nothing but raw oysters,

21:04.854 --> 21:08.105
and if Diane came out
of the surf naked one day,

21:08.275 --> 21:12.191
all l'd want from her
would be the hockey scores.

21:12.365 --> 21:15.485
And you wouldn't even get that.

21:15.661 --> 21:19.612
l'm afraid that's not good enough.
Diane, we're leaving.

21:19.791 --> 21:22.995
Excuse me, Diane.
Doc, could l have a word with you?

21:23.171 --> 21:25.544
- What about?
- Listen, Doc.

21:27.386 --> 21:29.758
lf you take her out that door now,

21:29.931 --> 21:35.010
those two will be dreaming dreams
about each other from now on.

21:36.065 --> 21:40.444
But, if she worked here, Doctor, hatred.

21:50.126 --> 21:53.081
l'm glad Coach stopped me
to ask me about

21:53.255 --> 21:56.258
career opportunities in psychiatry.

21:58.345 --> 22:01.513
Yes, Harvard is excellent.

22:01.683 --> 22:05.683
You see, it gave me
some time to reflect.

22:05.856 --> 22:10.152
- Diane, you must come back to work.
- l must?

22:10.320 --> 22:13.489
You and Sam had
an emotional experience.

22:13.658 --> 22:17.528
Now this will give you
an opportunity to defuse,

22:17.707 --> 22:20.792
to demythologise your romance.

22:22.087 --> 22:24.758
lsn't he amazing?

22:24.926 --> 22:26.883
Abundantly.

22:31.518 --> 22:35.647
- Sammy, are you going to tell Carla?
- Yeah...

22:35.816 --> 22:38.485
Maybe you ought to give me a hand.

22:44.703 --> 22:47.277
What's this all about?

22:50.502 --> 22:52.792
- Got her?
- Check.

22:54.007 --> 22:57.258
Carla, Diane is coming
back to work here.

23:03.103 --> 23:04.764
Really?

23:04.940 --> 23:10.149
At last, some help.
And she's had experience, too.

23:10.321 --> 23:14.452
l hope she can start right away.

23:17.207 --> 23:19.247
Take her in the back.

23:20.711 --> 23:24.759
You think l'll try to kill her,
or hurt her, or maim her.

23:27.095 --> 23:32.887
Walls, walls, walls.
Sam, Diane and l really must be going.

23:33.063 --> 23:36.977
- But we'll be seeing each other again.
- l guess we will.

23:37.151 --> 23:41.401
Hey, Frasier, let me congratulate you
on your new honey.

23:41.575 --> 23:44.411
Thanks, Sam. l've never been happier.

23:44.578 --> 23:47.747
Let me congratulate you, too, Diane.

23:49.627 --> 23:52.796
For heaven's sake, give her a kiss.

23:54.468 --> 23:57.755
- Yeah, why not?
- Why not?

23:57.930 --> 23:59.972
Seems appropriate.

24:27.430 --> 24:30.183
Now there's a healthy beginning.

24:37.360 --> 24:39.401
Nuts about me.

24:40.282 --> 24:41.777
Pitiful.
