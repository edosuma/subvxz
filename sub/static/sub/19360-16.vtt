Cyber attacks have gone
from a vague threat

01:10.037 --> 01:12.004
to one of the most
urgent security problems

01:12.106 --> 01:13.338
in the United States.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.277
We've come to an underground
car park just outside Tel Aviv

01:52.379 --> 01:54.980
to meet someone who's gonna
show us how easy it is

01:55.082 --> 01:58.951
to launch a cyber attack
on almost any modern car.

01:59.053 --> 02:00.519
Just like any connective computer,

02:00.621 --> 02:04.089
everything that you connect to the
internet is vulnerable at the end.

02:04.191 --> 02:07.759
So, this is true the same way to cars.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.695
Ben: <i>Ziv is using a wireless adapter</i>

02:16.103 --> 02:17.836
What's weird about this
little experiment we're doing

02:17.938 --> 02:22.374
is that I've got no idea what it is
that he's gonna be trying on us.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.042
So, we're gonna start small,

02:24.145 --> 02:26.078
playing a bit with her windows.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.717
He's been putting the

02:36.323 --> 02:38.423
The right indicator's coming on.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.325
So, now he's messing with
the miles-an-hour thing.

02:40.427 --> 02:43.262
It's going all the way up
to 220 kilometers an hour.

02:43.364 --> 02:46.231
The revometer's going
all over the place.

02:46.333 --> 02:49.935
This would freak you out if you didn't
know it was being done on purpose.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.375
Now he... Now it's completely disabled.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.343
"Engine malfunction."

02:58.445 --> 03:00.863
The fact that he can do all of
this means he can very easily

03:00.938 --> 03:04.005
just ram this straight into
that wall in front of us.

03:05.052 --> 03:07.853
That experience and the
experiment we just did then

03:07.955 --> 03:10.389
is probably the first
time where I've thought

03:10.491 --> 03:13.692
hacking could physically
cause harm to me.

03:13.794 --> 03:15.194
How many cars in the world

03:15.296 --> 03:18.997
do you think you could do the
same thing to right now?

03:19.099 --> 03:21.567
Today, I would say that most of them

03:21.669 --> 03:25.237
are vulnerable or susceptible
to hackers' attacks.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.839
Ben: <i>Though there aren't
any cars made in Israel,</i>

03:27.942 --> 03:31.176
<i>the world's top auto security

<i>that's sweeping across the country.</i>

03:35.616 --> 03:38.650
Israel's become a world
leader in cyber technology,

03:38.752 --> 03:40.118

03:40.221 --> 03:42.120
who are at the forefront
of that revolution

03:42.223 --> 03:43.855
are inside this building.

03:49.263 --> 03:51.630
There are over 10,000 people here

03:51.732 --> 03:53.031
from all over the world,

03:53.133 --> 03:55.834
and what many of them
have come here to hear

03:55.936 --> 03:57.169
is Benjamin Netanyahu,

03:57.271 --> 03:58.570
the Israeli Prime Minister,

03:58.672 --> 03:59.972
laying out why his country

04:00.074 --> 04:02.407
is a global leader in the field.

04:02.509 --> 04:05.043
(Netanyahu speaking English)

04:25.933 --> 04:27.733
Ben: <i>In fact, Israel receives</i>

04:27.835 --> 04:30.002
<i>more venture capital funds per person</i>

04:30.104 --> 04:32.337
<i>than any other country in the world,</i>

04:32.439 --> 04:35.440
<i>and has become known
as the Startup Nation.</i>

04:35.542 --> 04:38.410
<i>To understand how Israel became
a global leader in this field,</i>

04:38.512 --> 04:40.412
<i>we spoke with Israeli journalist</i>

04:40.514 --> 04:42.347
<i>and senior defense correspondent</i>

04:42.449 --> 04:43.882
<i>Alon Ben-David.</i>

04:43.984 --> 04:46.051
It's a very small community

04:46.153 --> 04:47.886
that is practically an island.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.389
<i>You are completely
surrounded with nations</i>

04:50.491 --> 04:52.391
<i>that you cannot cross through.</i>

04:52.493 --> 04:54.359
Israel developed creativity

04:54.461 --> 04:57.462
to compensate for its lack of resources.

04:57.564 --> 05:00.032
And it is a country
that needs to conduct

05:00.134 --> 05:02.467
constant surveillance
on their neighbors.

05:02.569 --> 05:05.070
As a country which is under constant

05:05.172 --> 05:07.539
annihilation threat by other nations,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.508
Israel understood many years ago

05:09.610 --> 05:12.344
that going into wars and launching
massive military operations,

05:12.446 --> 05:15.280
it bears almost unbearable prices.

05:15.382 --> 05:19.217
First, in human lives, in
terms of economic costs,

05:19.320 --> 05:21.486
in terms of international legitimacy.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.555
So cyber was the right answer

05:23.657 --> 05:25.857
for many things that
Israel needed to do.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.627
Do you think Israel's...

05:28.729 --> 05:32.097
private cybersecurity industry

05:32.199 --> 05:36.768
is essentially the child of the
Israeli military's affairs?

05:36.870 --> 05:40.138
Oh, absolutely. The whole of
the Israeli cyber industry

05:40.240 --> 05:42.174
relies on knowledge gathered

05:42.276 --> 05:44.509
by people serving in Israel's different

05:44.611 --> 05:47.446
security agencies in the military.

05:47.548 --> 05:50.549
Ben: <i>Military service is mandatory
for most Israeli citizens,</i>

05:50.651 --> 05:53.552
<i>and one of the largest parts
of the Israeli Defense Force</i>

05:53.654 --> 05:55.787
<i>is its Cyber and Intelligence units.</i>

05:55.889 --> 05:59.991
<i>These entire units, and
some 20,000 cyber soldiers,</i>

06:00.094 --> 06:02.661
<i>are now being relocated to Beersheeba,</i>

06:02.763 --> 06:04.696
<i>a desert city which is quickly becoming</i>

06:04.798 --> 06:06.998
<i>Israel's Silicon Valley.</i>

06:07.101 --> 06:09.668
<i>This military-industrial cyber complex</i>

06:09.770 --> 06:13.271
<i>is said to be the largest infrastructure
project in Israel's history.</i>

06:13.374 --> 06:14.906
<i>We spoke with the CEO</i>

06:15.008 --> 06:17.542
<i>behind this $5 billion undertaking,</i>

06:17.644 --> 06:19.678
<i>Roni Zehavi.</i>

06:19.780 --> 06:20.879
What's the significance

06:20.981 --> 06:23.014
of the military being a
part of all of this?

06:23.117 --> 06:26.017
Because going to the
service is compulsory,

06:26.120 --> 06:27.886
you can look at the Israeli Army

06:27.988 --> 06:30.689
as the largest HR
Organization in the world.

06:30.791 --> 06:34.626
Because, practically speaking,
they'll start scanning

06:34.728 --> 06:36.995
the layers of the Israeli population

06:37.097 --> 06:39.831
and position the right
people in the right places,

06:39.933 --> 06:41.500
especially in elite units.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.369
<i>So, if you think about it, you take
somebody who is 18 years of age,</i>

06:44.471 --> 06:48.974
<i>and you get them exposed to the
state-of-the-art technology,</i>

06:49.076 --> 06:52.310
<i>to the highly advanced
paradigms and methodologies,</i>

06:52.413 --> 06:55.680
so when they go out of the
service, at the age of 23, 24,

06:55.783 --> 06:58.650
from an IBM point of view,
or from EMC point of view,

06:58.752 --> 07:00.252
or from Intel point of view,

07:00.354 --> 07:02.988
somebody has already
conducted the screening,

07:03.090 --> 07:06.558
and already selected the best
they can get in that sense.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.494
Ben: <i>But the initial screening
and recruitment process</i>

07:09.596 --> 07:11.797
<i>for the IDF's most elite cyber units</i>

07:11.899 --> 07:14.065
<i>actually begins much earlier.</i>

07:14.168 --> 07:16.501
<i>In 2013, the Ministry of Defense</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:18.437
<i>helped create a national program</i>

07:18.539 --> 07:22.040
<i>for high school students interested in
learning more about the realm of cyber.</i>

07:22.142 --> 07:25.844
<i>These after-school classes have
become unofficial feeder programs</i>

07:25.946 --> 07:27.512
<i>for the IDF's cyber units.</i>

07:27.614 --> 07:31.416
<i>We met with a recruiter for
one of those units, C4I.</i>

07:31.518 --> 07:33.018
<i>We could not reveal her identity</i>

07:33.120 --> 07:35.287
<i>because of her security clearance.</i>

07:35.389 --> 07:37.956
(speaking Hebrew)

07:55.843 --> 07:58.710
(woman speaking English)

08:04.751 --> 08:06.885
(recruiter speaking Hebrew)

08:06.987 --> 08:10.956
Ben: <i>For decades, Unit 8200
was a closely-guarded secret,</i>

08:11.058 --> 08:14.392
<i>partially because this elite
cyber and intelligence division</i>

08:14.495 --> 08:16.294
<i>doesn't just provide defense.</i>

08:16.396 --> 08:17.762
<i>In fact, they're responsible</i>

08:17.865 --> 08:20.832
<i>for one of the most aggressive
cyber attacks in history.</i>

08:22.102 --> 08:23.401
<i>Stuxnet, a cyber attack</i>

08:23.504 --> 08:26.137
<i>that sabotaged the
Iranian nuclear program</i>

08:26.240 --> 08:27.506
<i>by destroying centrifuges</i>

08:27.608 --> 08:29.541
<i>at the Natanz Nuclear Facility,</i>

08:29.643 --> 08:31.877
<i>is widely believed to
be a joint operation</i>

08:31.979 --> 08:35.080
<i>of Unit 8200 and the NSA.</i>

08:35.182 --> 08:37.148
<i>And in 2014,</i>

08:37.251 --> 08:38.917
<i>43 former members of 8200</i>

08:39.019 --> 08:41.886
<i>wrote an open letter
to the prime minister</i>

08:41.989 --> 08:43.522
<i>refusing to serve because of the unit's</i>

08:43.624 --> 08:45.423
<i>widespread use of surveillance.</i>

08:45.526 --> 08:48.660
<i>We met with one of the
soldiers who signed the letter</i>

08:48.762 --> 08:51.363
(speaking English)

09:04.811 --> 09:06.711
Ben: <i>What's wrong with that?
If you're at war</i>

09:06.813 --> 09:10.315
with another people and you've
got complete surveillance?

09:10.417 --> 09:13.184
That sounds like quite an advantage.

09:13.287 --> 09:16.154
(speaking English)

09:46.186 --> 09:48.186
If someone's cheating on their wife,

09:48.288 --> 09:51.222
and Unit 8200 have discovered this,

09:51.325 --> 09:53.858
what's the benefit of
having that information?

09:53.961 --> 09:57.262
(speaking English)

10:07.708 --> 10:08.740
It's blackmail.

10:08.842 --> 10:11.643
(chuckles)

10:11.745 --> 10:14.579
Ben: <i> Despite its shadowy
reputation, one thing is clear:</i>

10:14.681 --> 10:18.617
<i>The skills and methods these
soldiers learn in 8200</i>

10:18.719 --> 10:21.620
<i>are extremely profitable
on the free market.</i>

10:21.722 --> 10:24.222
<i>These veterans have gone
on to create tech startups</i>

10:24.324 --> 10:25.890
<i>worth billions of dollars,</i>

10:25.993 --> 10:28.026
<i>and the most prestigious tech companies</i>

10:28.128 --> 10:30.996
<i>actively recruit former 8200 members.</i>

10:31.098 --> 10:34.532
<i>Sharon Nimirovski served in one

10:47.314 --> 10:50.215

11:04.631 --> 11:08.533
<i>After he gets it, everything

11:18.311 --> 11:19.778

11:19.880 --> 11:22.514
You sell it. You sell it on the darknet.

<i>including physical facilities,</i>

12:15.502 --> 12:18.570
<i>are also becoming indisputable.</i>

12:18.672 --> 12:19.938
<i>We met up with Barak Perelman,</i>

12:20.040 --> 12:23.174
<i>an 8200 vet and founder of INDEGY,</i>

12:23.276 --> 12:25.677
<i>a startup that builds
cyber security networks</i>

12:25.779 --> 12:29.280
<i>for industrial facilities that
could be vulnerable to hacks.</i>

12:29.382 --> 12:31.750
What happened in the last decade or so

12:31.852 --> 12:34.119
was the interconnectivity
between the systems.

12:34.221 --> 12:37.288
"I want access anytime,
anywhere, to any place."

12:37.390 --> 12:40.859
- Quite convenient, in theory.
- Convenient for the operators

12:40.961 --> 12:43.394
and making it more
convenient for the hackers.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.964
Perelman: <i>The type of control systems</i>

12:46.066 --> 12:48.433
<i>that essentially manage the pumps</i>

12:48.535 --> 12:50.635
<i>and the valves in all of this facility,</i>

12:50.737 --> 12:53.505
were designed 20 years
ago, 30 years ago.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.373
<i>They are very easily penetrable.</i>

12:55.475 --> 12:58.610
<i>Very easy to disable them,
very easy to manipulate them.</i>

12:58.712 --> 13:01.446
Could you do that? Um, so...

13:01.548 --> 13:03.047
the short answer is yes.

13:03.150 --> 13:05.683
Ben: <i>Barak hacked into
the reservoir systems</i>

13:05.786 --> 13:08.753
<i>to show us how dangerous a
simple piece of malware can be.</i>

13:08.855 --> 13:12.590
<i>First, he shut down the valves
which drain the sewage.</i>

13:12.692 --> 13:15.994
<i>Simultaneously, he manipulated
the system's display</i>

13:16.096 --> 13:18.830
<i>to indicate that everything
was operating normally.</i>

13:18.932 --> 13:20.965
There's not a big red sign saying,

13:21.067 --> 13:25.136
"Alert! You've been hacked." Exactly.

13:25.238 --> 13:28.039
<i>The eventual result of this would
be the reservoirs filling up</i>

13:28.141 --> 13:30.441
<i>and having a toxic overflow.</i>

13:30.544 --> 13:32.243
This is theoretical. Can
you give me an example

13:32.345 --> 13:34.412
of where this has happened
in the real world?

13:34.514 --> 13:37.115
So, I want to refute the
fact that it's theoretical,

13:37.217 --> 13:39.284
because as recent as a few months ago,

13:39.386 --> 13:42.086
in the Ukraine, a power grid
that was being shut down,

13:42.189 --> 13:45.156
industrial control systems got hacked.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.593
A few years ago, we had reporting
by the German government

13:48.695 --> 13:51.229
<i>that a furnace was being
blown up in a steel mill</i>

13:51.331 --> 13:52.630
<i>due to a cyber attack.</i>

13:52.732 --> 13:54.465
It's the same industrial
control systems.

13:54.568 --> 13:58.269
If I hacked one of them, I can hack,
presumably, all the others as well.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.005
<i>This is, without exaggeration,</i>

14:01.107 --> 14:02.707
<i>life-threatening attacks.</i>

14:02.809 --> 14:04.776
<i>If I hack into a pharmaceutical plant</i>

14:04.878 --> 14:07.312
<i>and I change the composure of the drugs.</i>

14:07.414 --> 14:10.882
<i>If I hack into an oil rig
and cause an oil spill.</i>

14:10.984 --> 14:13.952
<i>If I create too much
pressure in oil pipelines.</i>

14:14.054 --> 14:17.388
All of this is no longer
data and privacy issues.

14:17.490 --> 14:21.125
It starts to be safety and
life-threatening situations.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.894
I have zero doubt in my mind

14:22.996 --> 14:25.396
that, currently,
critical infrastructures

14:25.498 --> 14:26.664
in the Western world

14:26.766 --> 14:28.166
already have malwares inside

14:28.268 --> 14:31.102
just ready for someone
to press that red button

14:31.204 --> 14:32.503
and shut off a power grid.

14:32.606 --> 14:34.873
The weapons are loaded, essentially.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.609
I think so. That's exactly
the definition I would use.

14:38.945 --> 14:40.745
Ben: <i>While cyber security companies</i>

14:40.847 --> 14:42.814
<i>become more and more in demand,</i>

14:42.916 --> 14:45.116
<i>the crippling potential of cyber warfare</i>

14:45.218 --> 14:47.018
<i>only continues to grow.</i>

14:47.120 --> 14:50.521
What we're talking about
here is a total revolution

14:50.624 --> 14:52.290
of the whole concept of war.

14:52.392 --> 14:55.426
It changes everything
we thought about war

14:55.528 --> 14:58.963
and how it's being conducted,
and what are the rules.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.765
And who is the enemy,

15:00.867 --> 15:02.734
and can you recognize the enemy at all?

15:03.970 --> 15:07.972
<i>Many countries have very
dangerous cyber tools.</i>

15:08.074 --> 15:10.975
Some are using it viciously,
like the Russians,

15:11.077 --> 15:12.844
<i>like the Chinese,</i>

15:12.946 --> 15:15.747
<i>and are not shy of using them
against other countries.</i>

15:15.849 --> 15:19.117
<i>We all understand the vulnerabilities
of critical infrastructure.</i>

15:19.219 --> 15:22.620
And we all understand the
vulnerabilities of privacy.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.155
But what troubles me

15:24.257 --> 15:27.759
is the ability to affect
the mindset of masses.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.193
The mindset of the public.

15:29.296 --> 15:33.097
<i>The Russians were manipulating
American public mindset.</i>

15:33.199 --> 15:35.733
That's scary. And that, I suspect,

15:35.835 --> 15:38.036
would eventually undermine

15:38.138 --> 15:40.939
most of Western democracies
in the coming decade.

15:41.041 --> 15:45.343
I fear that the good 70
years post-World War II

15:45.445 --> 15:49.080
of prospering democracies
in the Western world,

15:49.182 --> 15:51.449
and prosperity, economic prosperity,

15:51.551 --> 15:52.644
are over.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.422
After World War II,

15:57.524 --> 15:58.890
the Allies punished Japan

15:58.992 --> 16:00.224
for waging war in Asia

16:00.327 --> 16:01.993
<i>by forcing it to disarm,</i>

16:02.095 --> 16:06.097
<i>and to swear off having offensive
military capabilities ever again.</i>

16:07.200 --> 16:09.033
<i>Over time, that pacifism</i>

16:09.135 --> 16:11.502
<i>became part of the Japanese psyche.</i>

16:11.604 --> 16:15.707
<i>But today, nationalism is on
the rise around the world</i>

16:15.809 --> 16:18.743
<i>and Japan has not been immune
to this political tide.</i>

16:18.845 --> 16:20.945
<i>Tensions are on the rise in the Pacific,</i>

16:21.047 --> 16:23.648
<i>and now Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe and his backers</i>

16:23.750 --> 16:26.751
are rethinking his country's
previously peaceful stance

This is the "Izumo." It's one

21:23.016 --> 21:26.150
There's a constitutional ban against
Japan having aircraft carriers,

this as a helicopter carrier.

21:32.058 --> 21:34.792

25:22.522 --> 25:23.754
in the middle of Tokyo.

25:23.856 --> 25:24.955
There are hundreds of people here

25:25.057 --> 25:26.357
and what they're all protesting

25:26.459 --> 25:28.225
is Japan's relationship with China.

25:28.327 --> 25:30.561
They're all pissed off that
China keeps encroaching

25:30.663 --> 25:31.762
on Japanese territory.

25:31.864 --> 25:33.831
(man speaking on P.A.)

25:36.669 --> 25:37.942
(speaking Japanese)

25:48.614 --> 25:50.514
<i>We chartered a boat to the Senkakus</i>

25:50.616 --> 25:52.950
<i>to see the disputed
territories ourselves.</i>

25:53.052 --> 25:55.085
<i>But the Japanese Coast
Guard intercepted our boat</i>

25:55.187 --> 25:56.987
<i>and jumped on board.</i>

26:01.648 --> 26:02.660
<i>Konichiwa.</i>

26:02.762 --> 26:04.862
(man speaking Japanese)

26:04.948 --> 26:07.631
So first... sure. Oh,
first can I just ask you,

26:07.733 --> 26:09.366
um, why... Why did you stop us?

26:09.468 --> 26:11.001
(speaks Japanese)

26:11.103 --> 26:12.469
I want to talk to...

26:12.572 --> 26:13.938
To the captain. I understand. Yeah.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.706
Sorry. I'm just trying to
understand, 'cause it...

26:15.808 --> 26:18.909
I don't think we're breaking any...
breaking any laws.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.245
(speaking Japanese)

26:34.894 --> 26:37.661
<i>The Coast Guard cited an
80-year-old fishing regulation</i>

26:37.763 --> 26:39.430
<i>as grounds to turn us away.</i>

26:39.532 --> 26:41.265
<i>But based on their past actions,</i>

26:41.367 --> 26:43.233
<i>they're concerned that an
incident in these waters</i>

26:43.336 --> 26:45.002
<i>could spark an actual conflict.</i>

26:45.104 --> 26:48.172
<i>So much so, that these
same Coast Guard vessels</i>

26:48.274 --> 26:50.407
<i>will physically block civilian boats</i>

26:50.509 --> 26:52.810
<i>from reaching the islands.</i>

26:52.912 --> 26:55.379
<i>And the hostility on the
water is escalating.</i>

26:55.481 --> 26:57.381
<i>China has been claiming, constructing,</i>

26:57.483 --> 27:00.517
<i>and militarizing islands in
the nearby South China Sea,</i>

27:00.620 --> 27:03.087
<i>dangerously amping up
tensions with the U.S.</i>

27:03.189 --> 27:04.421
<i>and its allies in Asia.</i>

27:04.523 --> 27:07.591
<i>But if local hostilities did
boil over into conflict,</i>

27:07.693 --> 27:10.227
<i>it would have major global consequences</i>

27:10.329 --> 27:13.397
<i>because the original post-war
agreements also stipulated</i>

27:13.499 --> 27:15.532
<i>that in return for Japan's pacifism,</i>

27:15.635 --> 27:18.235
<i>the U.S. is legally
bound to defend them.</i>

27:19.438 --> 27:22.573
We are committed to
the security of Japan

27:22.675 --> 27:27.244
and all areas under its
administrative control.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.446
Gianna: <i>Retired admiral Yoji Koda</i>

27:32.985 --> 27:35.419

if Japan goes to war,</i>

27:35.521 --> 27:37.154
<i>the U.S. is going with them.</i>

27:37.256 --> 27:41.025
One of the fundamental reasons why Japan
maintains the U.S.-Japan Alliance,

27:41.127 --> 27:44.862
if anything, the aggression
happens toward Japan,

27:44.964 --> 27:47.398
Self-Defense Force role is to repel

27:47.500 --> 27:49.566
those... the invaders.

27:49.669 --> 27:51.869
No more than that. We can't
strike their homeland.

27:51.971 --> 27:55.673
Japan fully depends on
the strategic deterrence

27:55.775 --> 27:58.308
and strike capability
of the United States.

27:58.411 --> 28:00.010
If China really...

28:01.180 --> 28:03.781
goes for the military action,

28:03.883 --> 28:06.517
the cost they are going
to pay is very bloody.

28:06.619 --> 28:07.785
They know that.

28:09.855 --> 28:11.455
Gianna: <i>And Japan has the hardware</i>
