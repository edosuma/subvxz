00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:04.170 --> 00:05.620
Previously on Andi Mack...

00:05.620 --> 00:08.880
I just wanted to see
how you were doing
with your... thing.

00:08.880 --> 00:12.250
Haven't had
any more... attacks.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.620
-Good!
-But I'm always
afraid I might!

00:14.620 --> 00:15.920
I have something for you.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.460
Are you giving this to me?

00:20.460 --> 00:22.120
It's hard to ask for help.

00:22.120 --> 00:23.960
But with this,
you don't have to ask.

00:23.960 --> 00:26.250
It's just there
when you need it!

00:26.250 --> 00:27.920
Buffy's been right all along.

00:27.920 --> 00:30.120
At least I'll mean it this time
when I tell her she's right.

00:30.120 --> 00:32.250
Shouldn't have
told you about that.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.170
She'd kill me
if she ever found out.

00:34.170 --> 00:36.040
I can't be your friend, Cyrus.

00:37.330 --> 00:39.040
Not if you're
friends with TJ.

00:39.040 --> 00:41.080
You're giving me
an ultimatum?

00:41.080 --> 00:43.500
Him or me.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.120
You're my best friend!

00:45.120 --> 00:46.830
Buffy, I choose you!

00:46.830 --> 00:48.620
You seem to know Bowie.

00:48.620 --> 00:51.540
-You could say that.
-Do you know if
he's seeing anyone?

00:51.540 --> 00:52.830
I don't think so.

00:52.830 --> 00:55.500
Cause I was thinking
I'd like to ask him out.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.250
-Is that...?
-Miranda.

00:57.250 --> 00:59.170
Yeah!

00:59.170 --> 01:00.880
And her daughter.

01:05.380 --> 01:06.750
I thought you liked this job.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.620
I do. I love it.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.830
But I'm a musician
at heart.

01:10.830 --> 01:12.830
And working at
a guitar store,

01:12.830 --> 01:16.080
I'll be giving lessons
and playing open mics.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.000
Getting an
employee discount.

01:18.000 --> 01:21.120
CeCe prefers the
employee discount here.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.540
Well, CeCe's getting
a pretty nice haul
from my last delivery.

01:24.540 --> 01:27.500
Plus free landscaping
and lifetime maintenance
to go with it.

01:27.500 --> 01:29.540
Okay, I'm putting in
my request now

01:29.540 --> 01:31.540
-that your next job
be at a craft store.
-(Bowie chuckles)

01:32.620 --> 01:34.460
Oh, hey! What's up?

01:34.460 --> 01:35.670
What brings you here?

01:35.670 --> 01:37.040
We were just in
the neighborhood.

01:39.830 --> 01:42.120
Andi, this is
my friend Miranda.

01:42.120 --> 01:44.540
I'm so excited
to finally meet you!

01:44.540 --> 01:45.920
Same.

01:45.920 --> 01:47.960
-And this is Morgan.
-(Andi chuckles)

01:47.960 --> 01:49.710
Miranda:
Morgi, say hello.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.080
No.

01:51.080 --> 01:53.500
(chuckles)
She's shy. She's only 7.

01:53.500 --> 01:56.540
It's okay.
She doesn't
have to say hi.

01:56.540 --> 01:57.710
What are you guys up to?

01:57.710 --> 01:59.960
A bunch of boring errands.

01:59.960 --> 02:03.420
And we have to see a yard
about some trees.

02:03.420 --> 02:04.790
But it was really nice
to meet you two!

02:06.380 --> 02:08.620
Uh, what if Morgan
hung out with us

02:08.620 --> 02:09.580
while you run errands?

02:09.580 --> 02:12.670
Oh! Would that be okay?

02:14.290 --> 02:17.080
I bet Morgan would love
to see your sewing hut.

02:17.080 --> 02:18.710
Crafting shack.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.580
Are you hearing this?

02:21.580 --> 02:23.960
That's really Andi's domain.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.670
I'm sure Andi
doesn't mind sharing.

02:26.670 --> 02:27.750
Do you...

02:27.750 --> 02:29.290
mind sharing, Andi?

02:33.790 --> 02:36.710
There's always room
for one more
in the sewing hut.

You said I couldn't be friends

03:47.380 --> 03:49.880
You said I had to choose.
I chose you.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.790
Buffy, why are you
being like this?

04:12.830 --> 04:14.170
You betrayed me.

04:14.170 --> 04:15.750
How did I betray you?

04:17.460 --> 04:19.040
I can explain it to you...

04:51.380 --> 04:52.920
(voice cracks) Yeah?
(cough) Yeah.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.790
You told people
the fundraiser's
today, right?

04:55.790 --> 04:57.420
Do you ever do that thing

04:57.420 --> 05:00.210
when you're typing an email
and your mom shouts at you
to clean the hamster cage,

05:00.210 --> 05:01.790
and you shout back,
"It's Ryan's turn,"

05:01.790 --> 05:03.710
and Ryan says, "Nuh-uh,"
and you say, "Uh-huh,"

05:03.710 --> 05:05.540
-and Ryan says, "Nuh-uh"--
-You didn't send the email?

05:05.540 --> 05:06.830
Nuh-uh.

05:08.080 --> 05:10.580

on the team is coming?

05:10.580 --> 05:11.790
Kinda.

05:11.790 --> 05:14.420
We have to make and serve
pancakes to 50 people!

05:14.420 --> 05:17.460
-And bacon.
-Stop! Not helping.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.380
Start texting
everyone you know.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.620

05:32.790 --> 05:34.670
Why did I just get
a text from you?

05:34.670 --> 05:36.750
You said to text my friends.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.500
Your other friends!

05:38.500 --> 05:40.040
The ones that aren't here!

05:40.040 --> 05:41.750
They're all here.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.420
(sighs)

05:49.580 --> 05:52.710
Okay, here we are.
This is Andi Shack.

05:56.830 --> 05:59.500
So, do you wanna
go inside?

06:00.790 --> 06:01.960
Okay.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.000
Alright.

06:20.710 --> 06:21.830
(music stops)

06:23.670 --> 06:26.620
Well, it's how I like it.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.670
And guess what?
Nobody ever tells me
to clean it up.

06:30.670 --> 06:33.790
It's the one place in the
entire world that belongs...

06:33.790 --> 06:35.920
completely to me.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.830
You're lucky.

06:39.710 --> 06:41.750
And so are you.

06:41.750 --> 06:45.540
Nobody's even allowed in here
unless I say it's okay.

06:45.540 --> 06:48.790
You're actually the first person
I ever let in right away.

06:48.790 --> 06:50.040
You're so nice.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.880
Thank you, Morgan.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.080
You're welcome.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.710
So...

06:55.710 --> 06:57.380
you wanna make something?

06:58.830 --> 07:01.500
It can be pretty much
whatever you want.

07:01.500 --> 07:02.750
Do you see
anything you like?

07:05.330 --> 07:06.710
-This.
-Andi: Not that!

07:06.710 --> 07:08.000
(bead clatters to floor)

07:08.000 --> 07:09.380
(sighs)

07:14.880 --> 07:16.000
Sorry.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.250
Just...

07:18.580 --> 07:20.460
ask before you touch anything.

07:20.460 --> 07:22.170
Is it gonna be okay?

07:23.330 --> 07:24.580
No.

07:25.750 --> 07:27.620
I have to start over.

07:29.460 --> 07:30.710
That's pretty.

07:32.500 --> 07:34.500
It's a Tibetan prayer box.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.000
I found it at a flea market.

07:36.000 --> 07:37.880
-Can I see it?
-Yeah.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.960
These are family heirlooms.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.830
My mom saved them
from when I was born.

07:46.830 --> 07:49.210
And now I'm making them
into a bracelet for her.

07:49.210 --> 07:50.750
And I'm going
to give it to her

07:50.750 --> 07:52.040
in this box.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.960
So, this is off-limits.

07:55.960 --> 07:58.880
But you can use
anything else you like.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.830
Just not this, okay?

08:02.330 --> 08:03.880
I'm gonna put
this up here.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.380
Then, we are going
to make a necklace.

08:07.380 --> 08:09.830
You are going
to love my beads.

08:14.420 --> 08:17.790
So... are we good?

08:17.790 --> 08:19.380
Eh.

08:21.880 --> 08:23.880
You're a tough nut,
Morgan.

08:25.790 --> 08:27.880
Look, I know you guys
are best friends,

08:27.880 --> 08:29.920
but you're very clique-y.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.290
I need you to branch out!

08:32.290 --> 08:33.750
(chuckles)
I'm just kidding.

08:33.750 --> 08:34.960
I know you can't do that.

08:34.960 --> 08:36.000
(Celia chuckles)

08:36.000 --> 08:38.290
-Oh, Celia!
-Oh, please don't stop.

08:38.290 --> 08:40.170
I was enjoying it.

08:40.170 --> 08:42.880
I wish I could talk to anyone
the way you talk to plants.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.670
You could practice on plants.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.330
Ah, I tried, but...

08:46.330 --> 08:48.790
you know me.
I can be, sort of, critical.

08:50.040 --> 08:51.830
-Oh, is Andi here?
-Yep.

08:51.830 --> 08:54.710
-She's shacking it up.
-Oh, yay! I'm gonna go see her.

08:54.710 --> 08:56.330
Andi has company.

08:56.330 --> 08:58.460
A friend... potentially.

08:58.460 --> 08:59.830
Depending on how today goes.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.210
So?

09:01.210 --> 09:03.500
Maybe we should
leave 'em alone?

09:04.500 --> 09:06.880
The way you're twitching?
Absolutely not!

09:06.880 --> 09:09.670
(stammering)

09:13.000 --> 09:14.330
(Celia clears throat)

09:14.330 --> 09:15.880
Who's this?

09:17.040 --> 09:18.330
Um...

09:18.330 --> 09:21.790
Uh, Celia, this is Morgan.

09:21.790 --> 09:24.920
Um, Morgan, that's Celia.

09:26.580 --> 09:29.170
And, uh, why are you
introducing her?

09:29.170 --> 09:30.880
I thought she was
Andi's friend.

09:30.880 --> 09:31.920
She your friend?

09:31.920 --> 09:34.080
Well, um...

09:34.080 --> 09:36.750
(clears throat)
Morgan is Miranda's daughter.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.040
Oh! And who is Miranda?

09:44.830 --> 09:48.540
Miranda is a person
that I am seeing.

09:48.540 --> 09:51.960
Oh, I did not know
you were seeing someone.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.380
Nobody said a word to me.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.920
-It's new!
-(Celia chuckles)

09:57.920 --> 09:59.670
Can't be that new...

09:59.670 --> 10:01.380
if her child is in
my backyard.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.460
(chuckles nervously)

10:10.080 --> 10:11.750
-(knocking)
-Hello?

10:11.750 --> 10:15.170
-Mommy!
-Hey, peanut face,
I missed you!

10:16.750 --> 10:18.250
I take it this is Miranda?

10:19.250 --> 10:22.000
Uh, Miranda, this is Celia.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.040
Oh!

10:24.040 --> 10:26.170
The grandmother.

10:26.170 --> 10:28.710
-I'm leaving now.
-Miranda: Oh.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.960
I obviously said something.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.330
I have to go apologize.

10:33.330 --> 10:34.960
-Bowie: I wouldn't.
-Just let her!

10:34.960 --> 10:37.500
-She'll be fine.
-Or not.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.120
-Most likely...
-Not.

10:39.120 --> 10:40.750
Did you two have fun?

10:44.960 --> 10:46.080
I did.

10:47.210 --> 10:50.330
She's a very unique and...

10:50.330 --> 10:52.250
interesting person.

10:52.250 --> 10:55.920
And I enjoyed
getting to know her.

10:55.920 --> 10:57.460
Thank you, Andi.

10:57.460 --> 11:00.290
I'll walk you guys out.

11:02.170 --> 11:03.620
Bye, Morgan.

11:06.580 --> 11:07.790
You're welcome!

11:11.250 --> 11:12.710
Okay.

11:18.620 --> 11:20.670
Sorry you didn't
like my beads.

11:20.670 --> 11:22.460
Sorry you didn't
like Andi Shack.

11:22.460 --> 11:24.670
Sorry you didn't
like anything

11:24.670 --> 11:27.000
except for the one thing
you couldn't have.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.040
That silver box.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.420
Oh! Oh, no.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.460
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

11:41.920 --> 11:43.290
She took it!

11:48.040 --> 11:49.330
She took it!

11:51.040 --> 11:52.330
Oh!

11:54.830 --> 11:56.290
She took my box!

11:56.290 --> 11:58.040
(objects rattling)

12:05.290 --> 12:07.040
So you knew
about this Felicia?

12:07.040 --> 12:08.580
Miranda.

12:08.580 --> 12:11.250
Well, what about the child?
Did you know about that?

12:11.250 --> 12:12.540
I knew about it,
but I didn't know

12:12.540 --> 12:15.080
she was gonna
be in your home
with my daughter.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.380
So what are you
gonna do about it?

12:17.460 --> 12:18.790
What can I do?

12:18.790 --> 12:20.250
You gotta get her
outta there.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.920
I can't do that.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.500
Fine. I can.

12:23.500 --> 12:25.210
Wait, Mom! Whoa!

12:25.210 --> 12:26.830
What's the harm?

12:26.830 --> 12:29.500
She's occupying
real estate in Bowie's life

12:29.500 --> 12:31.790
that belongs to you and Andi.

12:31.790 --> 12:33.710
Look, who Bowie chooses
to hang out with

12:33.710 --> 12:34.750
is none of my business.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.580
Also, her daughter is seven,

12:36.580 --> 12:38.080
so I'm guessing
Andi can handle her.

12:38.080 --> 12:40.880
(sighs)
She stole my bracelet!

12:40.880 --> 12:42.170
You were saying?

12:42.170 --> 12:43.920
Who stole your bracelet?

12:43.920 --> 12:45.040
Morgan!

12:45.040 --> 12:47.040
I was making it for you!

12:47.040 --> 12:50.880
-Aw.
-Out of the hospital wristbands
we wore when I was born.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.210
Aw!

12:52.210 --> 12:54.250
(sighs)
Which she took!

12:54.250 --> 12:56.120
She can't have them!

12:56.120 --> 12:58.080
But why would she want them?

12:58.080 --> 13:00.040
Because I put them
in a pretty, shiny box

13:00.040 --> 13:01.170
that I told her not to touch.

13:01.170 --> 13:03.210
Your daughter needs you.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.920
You have to talk to Bowie.

13:04.920 --> 13:08.670
If you don't,
the child could be
her stepsister!

13:10.250 --> 13:12.250
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.210
Bex:
Brittany, I'm taking
my break early!

13:21.210 --> 13:22.830
We need more pancakes!

13:22.830 --> 13:24.830
And bacon!
Those people are hungry!

13:24.830 --> 13:26.290
I just put some on.
They're gonna have to wait.

13:26.290 --> 13:27.750
Well, hurry up.

13:27.750 --> 13:29.170
A husky kid
just growled at me.

13:29.170 --> 13:31.120
I'm going as fast as I can.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.750
-And my feet hurt.
-Suck it up, Gus!

13:34.750 --> 13:36.880
Cyrus, my hero,

13:36.880 --> 13:38.170
and Buffy, my savior!

13:38.170 --> 13:40.170
-Do you still need me?
-Of course!

13:40.170 --> 13:42.000
We haven't even started
busing those tables.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.580
Oh, no!

13:44.580 --> 13:46.420
I think I'm getting
a nosebleed.

13:47.670 --> 13:49.040
This thing is a disaster.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.620
Thank you for coming.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.620
I can't stay
if he's here.

13:54.710 --> 13:57.040
Well, he's not leaving!

13:57.040 --> 13:58.250
'Cause he's a good friend.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.790
What's going on?

13:59.790 --> 14:01.080
Are you guys fighting?

14:03.830 --> 14:04.920
Over what?

14:06.080 --> 14:07.500
Go on.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.170
Tell him why
you're mad at me.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.170
So now you're not
speaking to me?

14:15.170 --> 14:17.540
I really need
you guys right now.

14:19.330 --> 14:21.250
I'm here for you, Jonah.

14:21.250 --> 14:22.500
And only you.

14:24.380 --> 14:27.330
These pancakes
need to be flipped.
Don't burn the bacon.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.580
I'll go deal
with the customers.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.790
I'll do pancakes.
You do bacon.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.170
And by the way,

14:41.170 --> 14:43.500
if you think
the silent treatment
is gonna get to me,

14:43.500 --> 14:45.670
you're sadly mistaken.

14:55.330 --> 14:56.330
I did that on purpose.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.540
It's called
"clearing the chamber."

14:58.540 --> 15:00.170
Could you pass
the paper towels?

15:13.210 --> 15:14.620
(sloshing)

15:16.960 --> 15:18.380
Come on.

15:18.380 --> 15:20.540
Morgan doesn't seem
like the kind of kid

15:20.540 --> 15:22.330
who would steal something.

15:22.330 --> 15:24.380
Which means
you don't believe me.

15:24.380 --> 15:26.330
That's not what it means.

15:26.330 --> 15:27.380
It-- it means...

15:28.710 --> 15:30.920
(sighs)

15:30.920 --> 15:33.960
-Are you sure
you looked everywhere?
-Yes!

15:33.960 --> 15:36.120
I looked everywhere!

15:36.120 --> 15:38.620
-Twice!
-Bowie, we wouldn't
ask you to do this,

15:38.620 --> 15:41.540
except what she took,
it's irreplaceable.

15:41.540 --> 15:44.000
You said it was a
Tibetan prayer box?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.210
It was
what was inside.

15:47.670 --> 15:50.710
The wristbands
we wore in the hospital
when I was born.

15:52.500 --> 15:55.960
Mine's like... this big.

15:55.960 --> 15:58.120
You saved them
all these years?

15:58.120 --> 16:00.540
I wish I had
shown them to you...

16:00.540 --> 16:02.380
in case we don't
get them back.

16:09.290 --> 16:10.960
We'll get them back.

16:13.330 --> 16:14.460
Don't worry.

16:19.960 --> 16:23.960
♪ Beautiful pancakes ♪

16:23.960 --> 16:27.460
♪ Made just by me ♪

16:27.460 --> 16:30.170
♪ Tasty and fluffy ♪

16:30.170 --> 16:32.620

16:32.620 --> 16:34.330
(snickers)

16:34.330 --> 16:36.290
You like that?
I got more.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.120
Hey! Where'd everybody go?

16:40.120 --> 16:41.830
Ow. Hot, hot, hot!

16:41.830 --> 16:43.000
Hot!

16:44.250 --> 16:46.880
Oh, come on.
That was some
quality batter patter.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.080
You could laugh a griddle.

16:51.580 --> 16:55.330
You know, I'm actually glad
you're not talking to me.

16:55.330 --> 16:57.210
The silence is peaceful.

17:03.960 --> 17:06.460
Say something.
Say anything!

17:06.460 --> 17:08.120
I don't want the silence!

17:08.120 --> 17:10.880
I can't handle
the silence!

17:13.330 --> 17:15.120
Since second grade,

17:15.120 --> 17:16.710
all that I've ever been to you

17:16.710 --> 17:18.750
is a good
and supportive friend!

17:19.920 --> 17:22.380
Is this really how
you want to treat me?

17:22.380 --> 17:23.920
Right before
you leave for good?

17:25.620 --> 17:27.920
Dude, stop yelling!

17:27.920 --> 17:30.330
I can't help it!
She won't talk to me!

17:30.330 --> 17:32.330
She refuses
to talk to me!

17:32.330 --> 17:33.330
Well, Buffy, talk to him.

17:33.330 --> 17:34.960
No.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.170
-See?
-You can't fight!

17:37.170 --> 17:38.330
You have to stop fighting!

17:38.330 --> 17:40.960
-(beeping)
-Now the pancakes are burning!

17:43.000 --> 17:45.960
Oh, no.
No, I think...

17:45.960 --> 17:47.460
I think it's happening.

17:48.710 --> 17:50.540
-What's happening?
-Jonah?

17:50.540 --> 17:52.080
I'm having
another panic attack.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.330
(breathing heavily)

17:58.420 --> 17:59.960
You have panic attacks?

18:02.790 --> 18:04.040
Since when?

18:04.040 --> 18:06.330
The first time
at your Bar Mitzvah.

18:08.580 --> 18:10.080
How many have you had?

18:10.080 --> 18:11.460
Just two.

18:12.420 --> 18:15.420
This wasn't one.
This was just...

18:15.420 --> 18:16.620
panic.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.880
But your dad told me that
they can happen at any time,

18:20.880 --> 18:22.040
and...

18:23.460 --> 18:26.540
even if I'm not having one,
I'm still scared I might.

18:26.540 --> 18:29.790
It's called "anxiety
about anxiety."

18:30.880 --> 18:32.750
Why didn't you tell us?

18:34.290 --> 18:35.750
It's embarrassing.

18:35.750 --> 18:38.830
It's just a physical
reaction to stress.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.580
That shouldn't be embarrassing.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.080
But it is.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.790
Remember when we made
that school orientation video?

18:45.790 --> 18:47.380
And you got all sweaty?

18:47.380 --> 18:50.040
"Sweaty?"
I was a human water fountain.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.420
According to my dad,

18:52.420 --> 18:53.620
that was a panic attack.

18:53.620 --> 18:56.420
Yeah, I guess it was.

18:56.420 --> 18:59.960
So, I went down
to the swings to calm down.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.460
That's where you found me.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.120
With TJ.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.420
Yeah.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.960
That was the first time
we ever really talked.

19:08.960 --> 19:12.960
He was the last person I ever
thought you'd be friends with.

19:14.170 --> 19:15.620
I know.

19:15.620 --> 19:17.000
Weird, right?

19:17.000 --> 19:19.080
But you know what's weirder?

19:19.080 --> 19:21.540
He wants to be
friends with me.

19:21.540 --> 19:23.210
Who knows why?

19:24.540 --> 19:26.290
I know why.

19:29.330 --> 19:30.620
I'm sorry.

19:35.380 --> 19:36.920
Me too.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.080
You can be friends
with anyone you want.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.420
I want to be friends
with you.

19:44.790 --> 19:48.250
I always want to be
friends with you.

19:53.120 --> 19:54.620
This is so beautiful.

19:56.710 --> 19:58.540
But... pancakes.

19:58.540 --> 20:00.620
(all laugh)

20:06.080 --> 20:07.710
Andi:
This thing with Miranda...

20:07.710 --> 20:08.830
it's not gonna last.

20:08.830 --> 20:10.330
She's not Bowie's type.

20:10.330 --> 20:11.580
I don't know.

20:11.580 --> 20:13.580
I really liked her
when I first met her.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.500
Yeah, well, I didn't.

20:15.500 --> 20:18.120
I get the feeling
she's really pushy.

20:18.120 --> 20:21.120
Like me spending
the day with Morgan
was obviously her idea,

20:21.120 --> 20:22.830
but she made Bowie pretend

20:22.830 --> 20:24.880
like it was all
very spontaneous.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.500
It did kinda backfire.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.460
This could get them
out of Bowie's life.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.620
That would be amazing.

20:32.620 --> 20:33.710
(knocking)

20:33.710 --> 20:35.580
-Hey!
-You're back!

20:35.580 --> 20:36.670
Did you find
the wristbands?

20:38.250 --> 20:39.540
Come outside for a second.

20:49.120 --> 20:50.500
Hey, Bex.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.540
Hey, Miranda.

20:53.540 --> 20:56.540
This is so awkward.
I hope we can move
past this.

20:56.540 --> 20:58.750
That would be
the ideal location.

20:58.750 --> 21:00.380
Past this.

21:02.080 --> 21:05.120
Morgan, is there something
you want to say to Andi?

21:05.120 --> 21:06.620
I'm sorry.

21:06.620 --> 21:09.000
It's okay, Morgan.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.120
I'm not mad.

21:11.120 --> 21:13.380
I just want
the wristbands back.

21:13.380 --> 21:15.380
Can I have them please?

21:15.380 --> 21:18.670
I'm sorry you lost them,
but I didn't take them.

21:18.670 --> 21:21.170
-But--
-That was very nice, Morgi.

21:22.460 --> 21:24.580
Now, Andi.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.080
Do you want to apologize
to Morgan?

21:26.080 --> 21:28.170
-What?!
-Excuse me?

21:28.170 --> 21:30.080
You wrongly accused
my daughter!

21:30.080 --> 21:31.500
I'm not wrong.

21:31.500 --> 21:33.580
-She did it.
-No, I didn't!

21:33.580 --> 21:35.040
My child doesn't lie.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.460
Well, mine doesn't either.

21:36.460 --> 21:38.170
I can't believe I ever thought
we could be friends!

21:38.170 --> 21:40.750
Time out, time out!
Everybody, just time out...

21:40.750 --> 21:43.460
while I go in there and
take a quick look around.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.580
-That okay with you?
-It's not in there.

21:48.580 --> 21:49.750
I just want to see for myself.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.380
-I'll help you look.
-Right behind you.

21:57.670 --> 21:59.540
-You have it.
-No, I don't.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.620
You're a really good liar.

22:07.830 --> 22:09.380
I'll give you that.

22:13.170 --> 22:14.420
You have it.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.170
No, I don't.

22:18.170 --> 22:19.250
Bowie:
Found it!

22:20.250 --> 22:21.790
-You did?
-Is this it?

22:28.750 --> 22:30.120
Where was it?

22:30.120 --> 22:32.080
A box of paper cranes.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.120
Must've somehow
fell in there.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.790
I looked in there.

22:36.790 --> 22:39.710
Now is there something
you want to say to Morgan?

22:46.330 --> 22:47.960
Sorry.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.040
No hard feelings, I hope.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.000
Me, too.

22:57.830 --> 22:59.420
You good?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.210
Okay.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.040
I'm-- I'm gonna
take them home.

23:17.080 --> 23:20.250
I know that
she took this box.

23:20.250 --> 23:23.000
But she was standing
right next to me

23:23.000 --> 23:24.710
when Bowie found it.

23:27.380 --> 23:29.790
Do you think I was wrong

23:29.790 --> 23:31.380
this entire time?

23:32.420 --> 23:33.620
Do you?

23:36.830 --> 23:38.170
No.

23:40.420 --> 23:41.620
Then, neither do I.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.880
I just wish that Bowie
believed me.

23:45.880 --> 23:50.080
♪ Everything will be alright ♪

23:50.080 --> 23:51.670
Me, too.

23:54.380 --> 23:55.830
Next on Andi Mack...

23:55.830 --> 23:57.330
It's the perfect accessory

23:57.330 --> 23:59.120
for the other thing
I got for you.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.250
The Fringe!

24:00.250 --> 24:02.420
-Do you have
an appointment?
-No.

24:02.420 --> 24:03.880
Is there a problem?

24:03.880 --> 24:05.790
I hope you have
a really good lawyer

24:05.790 --> 24:07.040
for when I sue you.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.620
-Andi!
-Walker?

24:08.620 --> 24:10.750
Andi has two guys.
Count 'em! Two!

24:10.750 --> 24:12.540
I don't think Andi
likes me anymore.

24:12.540 --> 24:13.750
I think you gotta do
something big!

24:13.750 --> 24:15.380
-Like what?
-Write her a song.

24:15.380 --> 24:16.960
Perform a song
for Andi at the open mic

24:16.960 --> 24:18.500
we're having here
tomorrow night.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.420
Jonah: You do remember I have
panic attacks, right?

24:20.420 --> 24:21.420
Oh, boy.
