00:22.264 --> 00:24.339
I, uh, I forgot my phone.

Chimney still not
texting you back?

00:25.726 --> 00:27.175
BUCK:
Uh, no, he, he did.

00:27.269 --> 00:29.862
That's great. What'd he say?

00:30.013 --> 00:32.322
"Stop texting me, Buckley."

I haven't heard from Maddie

00:37.354 --> 00:39.263
since I told her about
Chimney leaving.

00:39.356 --> 00:42.783
I guess no one
is speaking to me.

00:42.859 --> 00:44.025
That's two people.

00:44.194 --> 00:45.602

No, it's, uh, it's weird
at work, too.

00:49.032 --> 00:50.274
Weird how?

Everyone missing Chimney?

00:51.701 --> 00:54.127
It's like no one is even
talking about him.

00:54.280 --> 00:57.781
You know, they're just
avoiding the subject.

00:57.800 --> 00:58.949
Avoiding me.

00:59.042 --> 01:02.119
Hen is being weird,
Eddie's being weird.

01:02.137 --> 01:03.637
Everything is just off.

01:03.789 --> 01:06.231
You think they blame me
for him leaving town?

01:06.458 --> 01:08.792
Probably not as much as you do.

01:09.628 --> 01:11.962
You know, my first boss
when I moved to L.A.

01:11.980 --> 01:13.906
was a real hard-ass.

01:14.057 --> 01:16.983
-This is how she'd look at me.
-(chuckles)

01:17.136 --> 01:19.319
All the time.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.728

01:20.823 --> 01:23.307
She did it every time
she came into the newsroom.

01:23.325 --> 01:25.826
And I was so self-conscious.

01:26.645 --> 01:28.587
Then she'd turn and leave
in a huff.

01:28.738 --> 01:32.240
Okay, so, so, what did you do
to-to make it right?

01:32.334 --> 01:34.075
Nothing.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.719
Someone else did.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.764
A surgeon. She had gallstones.

01:38.933 --> 01:42.101
That's why she kept
scowling at me.

01:42.177 --> 01:44.344

09:43.399 --> 09:47.085
A grown woman has been harassing
you at work for weeks now,

09:47.312 --> 09:48.978
and I'm just now
hearing about it?

09:48.997 --> 09:50.738
Why are neither of my children
talking to me?

09:50.832 --> 09:52.573
-(May scoffs)
-Do I need to come down there

09:52.593 --> 09:54.593
and have a word
with Miss Claudette?

09:54.744 --> 09:56.410
(scoffs)
That's another hard pass.

09:56.430 --> 09:58.504
She already thinks I'm a child,

09:58.599 --> 10:01.082
so having my mommy come stick up
for me isn't going to help.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.659
Okay, fine.

10:02.661 --> 10:05.662
But just say the word.
You know I always got your back.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.088
Mm-hmm.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.682
Now... about Harry.

10:10.685 --> 10:12.927
<i> MS. PINCUS: Thank you</i>
<i> for coming down, Mr. Grant.</i>

10:13.021 --> 10:14.595
<i> BOBBY:</i>
<i> It's Nash. I'm his stepfather.</i>

10:14.689 --> 10:17.765
Ah. Our files have been a mess
since the cyberattacks.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.952
We had Harry give us a parent's
phone number, and we never...

10:21.179 --> 10:23.288
Ah. He had you call me.

10:24.182 --> 10:26.774
-Okay, so what did he do?
-(sighs)

10:26.868 --> 10:28.109
I want to be clear.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.778
We're all very sensitive
to the fact that Harry

10:30.905 --> 10:32.464
has been through
a significant trauma.

10:32.615 --> 10:34.207
We've done our best
to be patient,

10:34.376 --> 10:36.376
but his acting out
has reached the point...

10:36.528 --> 10:39.137
-Acting out?
-He has been ill-tempered.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.380
Not turning in his homework,

10:40.532 --> 10:42.382
using expletives
with his teachers.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.292
But now we have moved past
the point of understanding,

10:45.312 --> 10:47.203
and we need to take action.

10:47.222 --> 10:50.190
Harry is being suspended
one week.

10:51.059 --> 10:52.876
One week for being ill-tempered?

10:52.894 --> 10:54.319
Not exactly.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.655
(students shouting)

11:02.404 --> 11:03.736
-HARRY: You're mad.
-(school bell ringing)

11:03.889 --> 11:05.238
I am surprised.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.148
The Harry that principal
was talking about

11:07.167 --> 11:08.741
is not the Harry that I know.

11:08.894 --> 11:11.911
Cursing, talking back
and now punching another kid?

11:12.063 --> 11:13.229
He's a jackhole.

11:13.322 --> 11:15.340
Well, Harry,
I think your parents

11:15.567 --> 11:17.658
are gonna want
a better explanation than that.

11:17.752 --> 11:19.903
I think you might want
to reconsider the language.

11:19.921 --> 11:21.513
Do they have to know about this?

11:21.664 --> 11:23.164
Harry, we're pals,
but you got suspended.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.407
I think your father's
gonna notice

11:24.426 --> 11:25.666
when you don't go
to school tomorrow.

11:25.686 --> 11:28.169
Well, can't I just stay
at the firehouse?

11:28.263 --> 11:29.854
-It's just for a week.
-No.

11:30.081 --> 11:32.190
And I know that's why
you got them to call me

11:32.341 --> 11:35.009
because you thought you could
get me to cover for you.

11:35.103 --> 11:36.602
They just don't get me.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.696
Not like you.

11:38.590 --> 11:41.324
Yeah, that's not
gonna work either.

11:42.185 --> 11:43.535
So you're gonna tell them?

11:43.762 --> 11:45.595
No, you are.

11:45.613 --> 11:47.096
(sighs)

11:47.115 --> 11:49.416
-♪
-(phones ringing)

11:50.268 --> 11:52.118
What are you doing?

11:52.212 --> 11:54.604
Um, I was just checking
my lipstick

11:54.622 --> 11:56.965
before I started work.

12:04.966 --> 12:06.683
(sighs)

12:07.561 --> 12:09.561
911. What's your damage?

12:11.714 --> 12:13.122
(bird squawking)

12:13.141 --> 12:14.457
<i> DANTE:</i>
<i> Okay.</i>

12:14.476 --> 12:16.383
We got a long list today.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.978
First we'll head west
towards the walnut trees.

12:19.130 --> 12:20.296
They're way overgrown.

12:20.389 --> 12:22.632
That list looks
more like a novel.

12:22.650 --> 12:24.968
-Maybe we should split up.
-Nah.

12:25.061 --> 12:26.636
A lot of these are two-man jobs.

12:26.654 --> 12:29.806
Well, 'cause one of the men
is old.

12:30.566 --> 12:32.992
(sighs)
It's gonna be blazing hot today,

12:33.086 --> 12:35.311
and I'd rather not risk
my delicate skin

12:35.330 --> 12:36.980
because you need someone
holding your hand

12:36.998 --> 12:38.147
while trimming some bushes.

12:38.166 --> 12:40.166
Did you just call me old?

12:40.260 --> 12:41.408
No.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.553
Your birth certificate
does that already.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.932
I mean, I got no trouble
working alone.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.842
I know what I'm doing.
Don't you?

12:50.011 --> 12:51.844
I don't think the boss
would like if we...

12:52.013 --> 12:52.920
(paper tearing)

12:53.014 --> 12:55.498
We each take an even share,

12:55.591 --> 12:57.442
and if you finish yours
before I finish mine,

12:57.593 --> 12:59.110
I'll clean the carts.

12:59.262 --> 13:00.853
You might need a nap by then.

13:01.006 --> 13:02.021
(door opens, closes)

13:02.115 --> 13:03.673
-Fine.
-(engine starts)

13:03.842 --> 13:06.326
As long as we get the job done.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.121
Just be real careful
trimming those high branches!

13:10.273 --> 13:11.848
RANDALL:
Can't hear you!

13:11.866 --> 13:13.333
I'm too busy winning!

13:24.712 --> 13:26.805
<i> (caller gasping)</i>

13:26.956 --> 13:28.197
Can you speak?

13:28.366 --> 13:30.391
If there's any way
you can speak.

13:31.202 --> 13:32.552
They're on a cell phone.

13:32.704 --> 13:34.370
See if you can get
their GPS coordinates.

13:34.797 --> 13:37.223
-(beep)
-We're trying to get
your location now.

13:37.300 --> 13:38.483
Please don't hang up.

13:38.634 --> 13:39.984
We're pinging your phone

13:40.136 --> 13:42.136
a more exact location.

13:42.730 --> 13:44.897

Nearest cell tower:

13:44.991 --> 13:46.140
Griffith Park recreation area.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.808
We have you
in the general vicinity

13:47.828 --> 13:49.068
of Crystal Springs Drive.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.220
Can you tell me the nature
of your emergency?

13:51.239 --> 13:53.314
You don't have to speak;
just try to touch

13:53.482 --> 13:55.741
one of the numbers on
your phone if you can hear me.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.410
-(beep)
-Okay.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.079
Touch a button
if the answer is yes.

14:00.290 --> 14:02.006
Do you need police?

14:02.233 --> 14:04.801
Do you need medical assistance?

14:05.737 --> 14:08.346
<i> -Are you injured?</i>

-Unknown injury.

-(siren wailing)

Copy, 118. Working on it.

14:20.935 --> 14:22.193
Fire and paramedics
are on the way.

14:22.345 --> 14:24.345
Can you still hear me?

14:24.422 --> 14:25.512
Hello.

14:25.681 --> 14:28.199
<i> 118, still have</i>
<i> an open cellular line.</i>

14:28.426 --> 14:29.926
Just hearing faint sounds

14:29.944 --> 14:31.018
<i> and a semi-truck's horn.</i>

14:31.096 --> 14:32.278
<i> Distant but not that distant.</i>

14:32.372 --> 14:34.706
Subject is possibly near
the I-5 freeway.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.523
<i> Dispatch, 118 on scene.</i>

14:36.618 --> 14:38.101
Are we sure about this?

14:38.194 --> 14:39.360
118, it did not sound
like a prank.

14:39.454 --> 14:40.545
They're out there.

14:40.696 --> 14:42.255
<i> All right,</i>
<i> let's spread out and search.</i>

14:42.883 --> 14:44.107

Can you hear us?

14:45.385 --> 14:47.276
-Fire Department!
-Fire Department!

14:47.295 --> 14:50.037
LAFD! Anyone out here?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.055
Anybody see anything?

14:51.207 --> 14:52.539
-Nothing, Cap!
-Sorry, Cap!

14:52.559 --> 14:55.134
<i> -(faintly): Nothing here!</i>
-Wait, wh-who said that?

14:55.228 --> 14:56.302
<i> Who said, "Sorry, Cap"?</i>

14:56.454 --> 14:58.212
<i> EDDIE:</i>
<i> Firefighter Diaz.</i>

14:58.231 --> 14:59.972

<i> Yeah, but I heard it anyway,</i>
<i> on the victim's phone.</i>

Everybody, with Eddie.

15:04.462 --> 15:06.487

<i>-BOBBY: Dispatch, we found him.</i>
-Okay.

RAVI:
Oh, God.

15:19.644 --> 15:21.144
EDDIE:
Chain saw must've hit a knot

15:21.162 --> 15:22.736
to cause it
to kick back so hard.

15:22.830 --> 15:23.737
Wedged it into his collarbone.

15:23.906 --> 15:25.498
BOBBY:
Okay, dispatch, patient located.

15:25.592 --> 15:29.243
<i>He couldn't speak because he had</i>
<i>a chain saw blade in his throat.</i>

15:29.262 --> 15:30.744
Buck, Ravi,
we're gonna need to remove

15:30.838 --> 15:32.579
-that blade from the motor.
-Oh, I-I don't think...

15:32.599 --> 15:35.158
Probie, if you're gonna vomit,
do it somewhere else.

15:35.176 --> 15:36.583
(gulps) Copy.

15:36.678 --> 15:39.086
Alive. Barely.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.271
His heart rate's elevated.

15:40.498 --> 15:41.940
Blade must've nicked
his carotid, but at least

15:42.167 --> 15:43.499
it's giving us
just enough pressure

15:43.518 --> 15:44.758
to prevent him from
bleeding out immediately.

15:44.852 --> 15:47.003
Okay, I'm gonna bolus
a liter of normal saline.

15:47.096 --> 15:48.521
Okay, Buck, I've got the weight.

15:48.673 --> 15:50.782
You got the disassemble
when you're done there.

15:50.933 --> 15:52.099
BP's dropping, 90/60.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.785
-He doesn't have very long.

15:53.936 --> 15:54.935

15:54.988 --> 15:56.412
-Set?
-He got it.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.332
All right, good to go!

16:05.131 --> 16:07.523
-Is he alive?
-HEN: Yeah. And stable.

16:07.542 --> 16:09.801
The chain saw did a number
on his neck, though.

16:10.028 --> 16:11.877
I knew we shouldn't have
split up.

16:12.030 --> 16:13.362
I can't believe
I let him get to me.

16:13.381 --> 16:15.974
Don't worry. We're gonna take
good care of him.

16:16.201 --> 16:18.309

16:29.731 --> 16:31.638

Hallelujah.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.509
There's no shame
in asking for help.

16:34.511 --> 16:37.370
Better than letting someone die
on your watch.

16:39.741 --> 16:40.981
It was humiliating.

16:41.150 --> 16:42.892
She just walked over,
plugged herself into my call

16:42.985 --> 16:44.243
and took it over.

16:44.395 --> 16:46.337
Well, did she save the guy?

16:46.489 --> 16:47.654
Not the point.

I could've saved him
if she'd let me do my job.

16:50.401 --> 16:52.159
But she didn't even
give me the chance.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.494
You just need to learn
how to stand your ground.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.404
Bullies don't back down
unless you make them.

16:55.423 --> 16:56.848
The only reason
she's dishing it out

16:57.075 --> 16:58.182
is because she knows
you'll take it.

16:58.259 --> 16:59.575
I don't think I should be
taking advice

17:07.360 --> 17:11.029
-you were coming over here?
-No. Why?

17:13.682 --> 17:16.367
There something
you forgot to tell your parents?

17:19.039 --> 17:20.371
HARRY:
I can't believe you told them.

17:20.523 --> 17:22.615
I wouldn't have had to
if you told them yourself

17:22.767 --> 17:23.949
-like we agreed.
-Harry,

17:24.044 --> 17:26.285
you just can't
take off like that.

about you, man.

17:30.608 --> 17:31.624
A-And you.

17:31.793 --> 17:34.052
You don't call us
to tell us that he's here?

17:34.203 --> 17:35.386
I didn't know he was on the lam.

17:35.538 --> 17:37.037
I didn't say anything
because I knew you guys

17:37.131 --> 17:38.539
were just gonna get mad.

17:38.558 --> 17:39.706
No one's getting mad.

17:39.875 --> 17:41.726
We just want to know
what happened.

17:41.953 --> 17:43.061
Why did you hit someone?

17:43.212 --> 17:44.637
Yeah, is something going on
at that school?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.731
-With this boy?
-We know you're going
through a lot,

17:46.958 --> 17:48.048

17:48.068 --> 17:49.383

I don't really want to talk
to either of you.

-Hey, Harry.
-What? You want me
to be honest, right?

17:53.556 --> 17:55.798
Yeah, but I don't want you
to be disrespectful.

17:55.891 --> 17:57.724
Fine. Sorry. Are we done?

17:57.860 --> 17:58.910
No, we're not.

17:59.061 --> 18:00.912
After everything
you've been through...

18:01.063 --> 18:03.306
I only went through anything
because of you two!

18:03.399 --> 18:05.474
-Dad just stood there
and let it happen.
-What?

18:05.493 --> 18:06.918
And Jeffery was only there

only the best for Marcia,
