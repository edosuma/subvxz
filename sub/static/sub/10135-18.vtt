08:28.175 --> 08:29.259
[crying]

08:29.301 --> 08:32.220
Oh! Two crying babies!

08:40.603 --> 08:43.648
Oh, great.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.648
The zoo crew is back.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.442
I think

08:43.690 --> 08:45.442
somebody missed somebody.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.195
Yeah, okay, kid, listen.

08:45.484 --> 08:48.195
Look, Ginger.

08:48.236 --> 08:50.322
I hate to break it to you,

08:48.236 --> 08:50.322
but it's over, alright?

08:50.364 --> 08:51.739
I'm a happily married man.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.867
There's nothing going on

08:51.781 --> 08:53.867
between you and me.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.083
Alright, okay, alright.

08:59.039 --> 09:02.083
Listen, listen, listen here.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.378
Now, look, I can't hang out

09:02.125 --> 09:04.378
with you, you know.

09:04.419 --> 09:07.755
Y-y-you wanna find a playmate,

09:04.419 --> 09:07.755
go-go find Michael Jackson.

09:11.718 --> 09:13.428
Look, I'm sorry. I don't

09:11.718 --> 09:13.428
wanna hurt your feelings.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.930
Y-y-you're a beautiful monkey.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.930
You-you got gorgeous eyes.

09:15.972 --> 09:19.434
Uh, really-really nice ears,

09:15.972 --> 09:19.434
a winning personality.

09:19.476 --> 09:22.896
It's just that, uh,

09:19.476 --> 09:22.896
you're too short for me.

09:24.689 --> 09:25.940
So, Wendy, what do you think?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.859
You're gonna take

09:25.982 --> 09:27.859
that job at that zoo?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.652
I don't know.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.947
But I do know I had

09:29.694 --> 09:32.947
a great time with you today.

09:32.989 --> 09:36.576
Oh, me too. Hope I didn't drive

09:32.989 --> 09:36.576
you nuts with my animal voices?

09:36.617 --> 09:38.161
No, it was fun.

09:38.203 --> 09:41.122
I've always wondered what

09:38.203 --> 09:41.122
a Tasmanian devil sounded like.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.250
[babbling]

09:45.544 --> 09:47.628
Well, I'm sorry,

09:45.544 --> 09:47.628
I played all those stupid tricks

09:47.670 --> 09:49.548
on you back when we were kids.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.050
Truth is

09:49.589 --> 09:52.050
I really did like you.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.429
Well, the truth is

09:52.092 --> 09:55.429
when I was a little girl

09:55.470 --> 09:57.431
I had a secret crush on you.

09:57.472 --> 09:59.015
Well, what if I told you

09:59.057 --> 10:01.142
I had a secret crush

09:59.057 --> 10:01.142
on you right now?

10:02.436 --> 10:04.896
I'd say, the secret's out.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.322
Hey, you're back.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.533
- And you're kissing.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.533
- Hey, Danny.

10:17.784 --> 10:21.162
Wow. I, I don't know

10:17.784 --> 10:21.162
what to say, uh..

10:21.204 --> 10:23.373
When you guys left here,

10:21.204 --> 10:23.373
you-you weren't even friends

10:23.415 --> 10:27.210
and now, uh, boy, you're

10:23.415 --> 10:27.210
very friendly, aren't you?

10:27.252 --> 10:28.545
Yeah. Isn't it great?

10:28.587 --> 10:30.880
And thanks to you

10:28.587 --> 10:30.880
for getting us together.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.549
Oh, hey, don't mention it.

10:32.591 --> 10:35.427
Uh, Joey, why don't you and I,

10:32.591 --> 10:35.427
uh, get dinner ready now?

10:35.469 --> 10:36.844
And, Wendy, you must be tired

10:35.469 --> 10:36.844
after your trip.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.472
If you want,

10:36.886 --> 10:38.472
you can rest in my room.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.681
Alright. Yeah,

10:38.513 --> 10:40.681
I am a little jet-lagged.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.226
Um, Ginger, you wanna take

10:40.723 --> 10:43.226
a nap up in Danny's room?

10:43.268 --> 10:44.894
Woah, wait-wait a minute,

10:43.268 --> 10:44.894
I haven't quite

10:44.936 --> 10:46.980
monkey-proofed the sheets yet.

10:47.021 --> 10:49.732
Oh, don't worry. I'll take care

10:47.021 --> 10:49.732
of Ginger. I'm a monkey expert.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.943
I've read every

10:49.774 --> 10:51.943
"Curious George" book.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.572
- Great. Thanks, Joey.

10:52.986 --> 10:55.572
- Sure.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.949
Ginger, are you gonna

10:55.614 --> 10:57.949
be a good girl?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.701
[squealing]

11:00.743 --> 11:02.579
Okay. I'll see you guys later.

11:02.621 --> 11:06.458
And I'll see you little later,

11:02.621 --> 11:06.458
you Tasmanian devil.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.836
[growling]

11:12.172 --> 11:13.840
Hey, Ginger, why don't you

11:12.172 --> 11:13.840
cop a little squat up

11:13.881 --> 11:16.217
here on the couch?

11:13.881 --> 11:16.217
We'll get to know each other.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.388
Hey, what do you say

11:18.803 --> 11:20.388
we get out

11:20.430 --> 11:22.098
this month's

11:20.430 --> 11:22.098
"National Geographic?"

11:22.140 --> 11:23.558
See if any of your friends

11:22.140 --> 11:23.558
are in there.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.767
I got an idea.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.479
We could pick nits

11:24.809 --> 11:27.479
off each other.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.063
- Joey, we need to talk.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.063
- Hey, Danny, come on.

11:29.105 --> 11:30.857
I'm trying to bond

11:29.105 --> 11:30.857
with the little chimp.

11:30.898 --> 11:34.068
What you're trying to do is

11:30.898 --> 11:34.068
bond with my little sister.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.280
What's wrong with that? Your

11:34.110 --> 11:37.280
sister happens a great girl.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.157
Joey, I wanted the two of you

11:37.322 --> 11:39.157
to be friends.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.742
I didn't want you to try

11:39.199 --> 11:41.742
and make a move on her.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.162
You know,

11:41.784 --> 11:44.162
if I didn't know you better

11:44.204 --> 11:46.956
I'd swear you didn't want me

11:44.204 --> 11:46.956
going out with your sister.

11:46.998 --> 11:49.250
Look, it's just not

11:46.998 --> 11:49.250
a good idea, alright?

11:49.292 --> 11:52.504
Danny, I really don't care

11:49.292 --> 11:52.504
what you think, okay?

11:52.546 --> 11:54.297
- You don't care what I think?

11:52.546 --> 11:54.297
- No, I don't.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.923
I'm your best friend, Joey.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.923
What are you talkin' about?

11:55.965 --> 11:57.884
Well, you're not being

11:55.965 --> 11:57.884
my best friend right now, okay?

11:57.925 --> 11:59.511
I'm as involved in this

11:57.925 --> 11:59.511
as you are.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.971
- You're not involved, alright?

11:59.553 --> 12:01.971
- It's my sister and you.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.557
- Where did Ginger go?

12:02.013 --> 12:03.557
- I don't know.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.350
You're the monkey-sitter.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.394
Why don't you just mind

12:05.392 --> 12:07.394
your own business, okay?

12:07.435 --> 12:09.479
You have no right

12:07.435 --> 12:09.479
to tell me who I can date.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.772
Now if you'll just back off

12:09.521 --> 12:11.772
and get out of my way

12:11.814 --> 12:13.441
I got a monkey to find.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.319
- Joey.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.319
- Don't Joey me, okay?

12:20.073 --> 12:22.242
My avocado mask is hardening.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.452
Yeah, I'm turning

12:22.283 --> 12:24.452
into guacamole.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.540
Mm. Let's scrape this off

12:25.828 --> 12:28.540
with Doritos.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.084
Girls, have you seen Ginger?

12:31.125 --> 12:33.420
Sorry, Joey,

12:31.125 --> 12:33.420
we can't see anything.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.255
Just my luck,

12:33.461 --> 12:35.255
I finally meet a woman

12:35.296 --> 12:36.964
I really like,

12:35.296 --> 12:36.964
and I lose her monkey.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.175
- Out of my way, Danny.

12:37.006 --> 12:39.175
- Maybe we should wake Wendy up.

12:39.217 --> 12:41.386
Oh, you'd like that,

12:39.217 --> 12:41.386
wouldn't you, making me look

12:41.428 --> 12:43.846
irresponsible, that would

12:41.428 --> 12:43.846
play right into your hands.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.726
I just thought maybe she knew a

12:43.888 --> 12:47.726
secret monkey call or something.

12:47.766 --> 12:50.186
Okay, Kimmy, one more minute,

12:47.766 --> 12:50.186
and I'll comb out your perm

12:50.228 --> 12:52.230
and shampoo

12:50.228 --> 12:52.230
in the special rinse.

12:54.566 --> 12:56.401
I hope you like the color

12:54.566 --> 12:56.401
I mixed for you.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.152
It's very subtle.

12:58.194 --> 13:02.198
Thanks, Deej. I wouldn't trust

12:58.194 --> 13:02.198
my hair to anyone but you.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.076
(DJ)

13:02.240 --> 13:05.076
'Kimmy, you can't afford

13:02.240 --> 13:05.076
anybody but me.'

13:05.118 --> 13:06.578
(Kimmy)

13:05.118 --> 13:06.578
'Good point.'

13:06.620 --> 13:08.871
(DJ)

13:06.620 --> 13:08.871
'Time's up

13:06.620 --> 13:08.871
on our fruit facials.'

13:09.748 --> 13:11.790
Okay.

13:11.832 --> 13:15.002
Alright, Kimmy.

13:11.832 --> 13:15.002
It's time to make you beautiful.

13:19.674 --> 13:25.430
Oh, Alex, isn't that precious?

13:19.674 --> 13:25.430
You rocked your daddy to sleep.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.726
Now, can you burp him for me?

13:31.436 --> 13:34.897
Hmm. Oh, I'm awake, I'm awake.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.276
I didn't miss anything.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.276
When did we have a baby?

13:40.278 --> 13:42.989
Come on, honey, you were up

13:40.278 --> 13:42.989
all night with the twins.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.492
Oh, hello.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.492
Why don't you take a nap?

13:45.533 --> 13:50.079
Yeah, that's a good idea.

13:45.533 --> 13:50.079
And why don't you join me?

13:50.121 --> 13:53.874
We turn the lights down,

13:50.121 --> 13:53.874
lock the doors and..

13:53.916 --> 13:56.169
...nap like we did

13:53.916 --> 13:56.169
on our honeymoon.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.589
Mm. I could go for a good nap.

13:59.631 --> 14:01.215
Have mercy.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.638
- I'll be right in.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.638
- Can't wait.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.892
Okay, you guys, now

14:09.098 --> 14:11.892
I want you to go to sleep.

14:11.934 --> 14:14.937
And if you wake up,

14:11.934 --> 14:14.937
just talk among yourselves.

14:16.189 --> 14:17.482
Okay?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.793
Hi, Becky.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.007
Mm.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.759
Is that a new perfume?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.222
It's a walk on the wild side,

14:46.886 --> 14:49.222
isn't it?

14:53.518 --> 14:54.686
Hm.

14:56.270 --> 14:58.898
Can't keep your hands

14:56.270 --> 14:58.898
out of my hair, huh, honey?

15:00.483 --> 15:02.151
Oh, I love you.

15:07.365 --> 15:09.158
Oh. Hm.

15:09.200 --> 15:10.869
That feels good, honey.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.831
Ah, you know

15:12.453 --> 15:14.831
all the right spots.

15:28.177 --> 15:30.221
The rough stuff tonight,

15:28.177 --> 15:30.221
huh, honey?

15:37.311 --> 15:39.773
Has Uncle Jesse been a bad boy?

15:50.491 --> 15:52.243
Becky..

15:52.285 --> 15:54.495
...when was the last time

15:52.285 --> 15:54.495
you shaved your back?

15:56.915 --> 15:59.041
[screaming]

15:56.915 --> 15:59.041
God! Urgh!

16:00.000 --> 16:01.836
I just made out with a monkey.

16:03.003 --> 16:05.047
- Did you see that?

16:03.003 --> 16:05.047
- Yes.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.049
And, honey, I think I learned

16:05.089 --> 16:07.049
a few tricks from Ginger.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.593
Get over here.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.512
[laughing]

16:11.554 --> 16:13.640
Whoa! I knew

16:11.554 --> 16:13.640
I should have knocked.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.852
There you are. Okay, come on.

16:17.894 --> 16:19.562
Come to your buddy, Joey.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.356
Oh, man, she hates me.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.817
Why won't that monkey

16:22.398 --> 16:23.817
give me a break?

16:23.858 --> 16:25.819
I don't know,

16:23.858 --> 16:25.819
but if you talk sexy to her

16:25.860 --> 16:27.737
she'll nibble on your ear.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.073
Joey, would you forget

16:29.363 --> 16:31.073
about this monkey for a second?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.533
You and I have to talk.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.243
Danny, there's nothing

16:32.575 --> 16:34.243
to talk about, you already

16:34.285 --> 16:36.579
told me you didn't want me

16:34.285 --> 16:36.579
goin' out with your sister.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.706
- Joey, would you listen to me?

16:36.621 --> 16:38.706
- No, I won't.

16:39.707 --> 16:41.417
Are you ready to take that nap?

16:41.459 --> 16:44.337
Yeah, right after I take a bath.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.046
Ergh!

16:48.633 --> 16:50.718
Well, I think

16:48.633 --> 16:50.718
I've done all I can do.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.183
I can't wait to see it.

16:57.224 --> 16:59.310
Trust me, you can wait.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.483
What? Do I look that stunning?

17:05.525 --> 17:08.027
I'm definitely stunned.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.446
Doesn't she look cute, girls?

17:10.488 --> 17:12.866
You look like Bozo.

17:14.826 --> 17:19.998
She means Francesca Bozo,

17:14.826 --> 17:19.998
that Italian supermodel.

17:20.039 --> 17:24.168
I'm talking about Bozo

17:20.039 --> 17:24.168
with the ball on his nose.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.588
D.J., what did you do to me?

17:27.630 --> 17:30.216
It's not D.J.'s fault,

17:27.630 --> 17:30.216
it's Nikata's.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.970
He's cursed this whole house.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.970
We gotta go feed him.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.432
- I've gotta see my hair.

17:35.722 --> 17:38.432
- Kimmy, don't.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.142
Oh, my God.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.980
I am so sorry.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.940
I'll pay to have it shaved.

17:45.982 --> 17:49.276
No. No, no, no. I love it.

17:49.318 --> 17:52.613
And finally,

17:49.318 --> 17:52.613
I'm one step ahead of Madonna.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.243
And the best part is

17:54.073 --> 17:57.243
my mom's gonna freak out.

17:57.284 --> 17:59.579
Thanks, Deej.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.997
Happy to help.

18:02.248 --> 18:05.001
- How do we feed him?

18:02.248 --> 18:05.001
- You got me.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.712
He has no stomach.

18:05.043 --> 18:07.712
He's just a head on a stick.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.382
Here comes Ginger.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.385
There goes Ginger.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.514
- Ginger, come back here.

18:15.887 --> 18:18.514
- Joey, come back here.

18:18.556 --> 18:20.140
Hi, dad.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.726
Steph, what are you doing?

18:21.768 --> 18:24.979
I'm trying to stop the horrible

18:21.768 --> 18:24.979
curse on this household.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.856
Oh, well, keep trying.

18:28.649 --> 18:31.277
Boy, tough house

18:28.649 --> 18:31.277
to take a nap in.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.404
Hey, my Nikata bank.

18:34.906 --> 18:37.408
What do you mean bank?

18:39.243 --> 18:42.956
I bought it for my tacky

18:39.243 --> 18:42.956
souvenir collection. Watch.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.498
[automated]

18:42.997 --> 18:44.498
Feed me.

18:46.084 --> 18:48.753
Thank you. Have a nice day.

18:50.088 --> 18:51.547
You mean, there's no curse?

18:51.589 --> 18:53.549
No, it's just for fun.

18:53.591 --> 18:57.219
See, Michelle? You little kids

18:53.591 --> 18:57.219
will believe anything.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.639
Oh, puh-lease!

19:02.642 --> 19:04.727
[chattering]

19:07.855 --> 19:12.192
Ah, there you are,

19:07.855 --> 19:12.192
you little missing link.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.779
Okay, now, come to Joey.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.659
Ginger, no! Hey, Ginger!

19:21.452 --> 19:23.454
Hey, Ginger.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.832
Yeah, come on in.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.041
Please?

19:27.083 --> 19:28.668
[chattering]

19:30.878 --> 19:34.048
Ginger, look, there's

19:30.878 --> 19:34.048
nothing to be afraid of.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.467
Just don't look down.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.177
Ginger, Ginger.

19:41.055 --> 19:43.641
Joey, what are you

19:41.055 --> 19:43.641
doing out there?

19:43.683 --> 19:46.894
I'm baking bread. What does

19:43.683 --> 19:46.894
it look like I'm doing?

19:46.936 --> 19:49.438
I'm trying to get a chimp.

19:49.480 --> 19:50.940
Joey, it's dangerous out here.

19:50.982 --> 19:52.358
Would you get in

19:50.982 --> 19:52.358
the house right now?

19:52.399 --> 19:54.652
I'm tired of you treating me

19:52.399 --> 19:54.652
like a little kid.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.070
I don't treat you

19:54.694 --> 19:56.070
like you're a little kid.

19:56.112 --> 19:57.363
I just know what's best for you.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.823
Now, you get in here

19:57.404 --> 19:58.823
before you catch a cold.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.867
See that?

19:58.865 --> 20:00.867
You're doing it again.

20:00.908 --> 20:03.285
Okay, excuse me.

20:03.327 --> 20:06.122
Now you got nowhere to run to.

20:06.164 --> 20:08.166
Joey, would you listen to me?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.917
No, you listen to me.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.336
I'm a nice guy.

20:09.959 --> 20:12.336
Wendy's a big girl.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.630
She doesn't need you

20:12.378 --> 20:14.630
to protect her from me.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.216
I am not trying

20:14.672 --> 20:17.216
to protect her from you.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.552
(Joey)

20:17.257 --> 20:19.552
'Oh, no? Well, then

20:17.257 --> 20:19.552
what are you doing?'

20:19.593 --> 20:21.762
I'm trying

20:19.593 --> 20:21.762
to protect you from her.

20:21.804 --> 20:25.058
Protect me from her?

20:21.804 --> 20:25.058
What are you talking about?

20:25.099 --> 20:26.976
Joey, I don't wanna..

20:27.018 --> 20:29.228
I don't want you to get hurt.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.688
Wendy's the kind of person..

20:30.730 --> 20:32.899
She's totally committed

20:30.730 --> 20:32.899
to her work.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.817
She could pick up tomorrow

20:32.940 --> 20:34.817
and just wind up

20:34.859 --> 20:36.903
halfway around the world.

20:36.944 --> 20:40.280
I've seen her

20:36.944 --> 20:40.280
break a lot of hearts, okay?

20:40.322 --> 20:43.159
Well, I appreciate

20:40.322 --> 20:43.159
you looking out for me.

20:43.201 --> 20:47.621
But I really like Wendy and

20:43.201 --> 20:47.621
I-I'm willing to take that risk.

20:47.663 --> 20:51.291
So would you just do me a favor

20:47.663 --> 20:51.291
and stop trying to be my dad?

20:53.794 --> 20:55.963
I'm sorry.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.340
I gotta learn to let go.

20:58.382 --> 20:59.967
But you are turning

20:58.382 --> 20:59.967
into a fine, young man.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.262
[laughing]

21:00.009 --> 21:03.262
Well, thanks.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.681
So would you just be my friend?

21:05.723 --> 21:07.683
I'll be more than that.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.683
I'll be your best friend.

21:07.725 --> 21:08.976
Alright.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.064
- Hey, Ginger!

21:11.353 --> 21:13.064
- Ginger!

21:13.106 --> 21:15.608
- Come on, open the window.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.608
- Would you open the window?

21:15.649 --> 21:17.484
- Go, get Wendy.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.484
- Thank you.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.154
Uh, oh, Ginger! Come on.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.156
- Get Wendy.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.156
- Hey, hey, I got this.

21:25.243 --> 21:27.411
Well, I bet you thought

21:25.243 --> 21:27.411
you were pretty funny

21:27.453 --> 21:29.329
with that little window gag,

21:27.453 --> 21:29.329
huh, Ginger?

21:29.371 --> 21:31.999
[chattering]

21:32.041 --> 21:33.709
Hey, thanks for saving us,

21:32.041 --> 21:33.709
Wendy.

21:33.751 --> 21:35.211
I thought you were taking a nap?

21:35.253 --> 21:37.671
I couldn't stop thinking

21:35.253 --> 21:37.671
about that job at the zoo.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.758
Now, if I take it, it's gonna

21:37.713 --> 21:40.758
mean living in a big city

21:40.800 --> 21:43.552
with noise, and traffic,

21:40.800 --> 21:43.552
and pollution.

21:43.594 --> 21:46.430
Hm, so you're not gonna take it?

21:46.472 --> 21:50.935
Well, it also means

21:46.472 --> 21:50.935
hot showers and pizzas

21:50.977 --> 21:55.064
and my little Tasmanian devil.

21:55.106 --> 21:57.275
So, I'm taking it.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.153
- Alright.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.153
- Yeah.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.238
You know what, you two actually

22:00.194 --> 22:02.238
make a pretty nice couple.

22:02.280 --> 22:03.572
[chuckling]

22:03.614 --> 22:06.659
Oh, it's great

22:03.614 --> 22:06.659
you're gonna be in town.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.953
[chattering]

22:08.995 --> 22:10.913
Well, we just have

22:08.995 --> 22:10.913
one little problem.

22:10.955 --> 22:13.791
Your monkey's been hiding

22:10.955 --> 22:13.791
from me all day.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.375
I think she hates me.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.508
Then why is she hugging me?

22:22.549 --> 22:25.469
Because her favorite game

22:22.549 --> 22:25.469
is hide and go seek.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.221
[chuckling]

22:25.511 --> 22:27.221
Okay. Mine, too.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.641
- Hey, put her there, babe.

22:27.263 --> 22:30.641
- Is everything okay?

22:30.683 --> 22:33.144
Looked out the window,

22:30.683 --> 22:33.144
I saw three monkeys in a tree.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.775
Oh. Oh! Good gosh.

22:39.817 --> 22:42.611
Alright, okay. I give up.

22:42.653 --> 22:45.572
Let me go get dressed. I'll dry

22:42.653 --> 22:45.572
my hair and we'll catch a flick.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.451
What's that? Okay, fine.

22:49.493 --> 22:51.620
We'll go see

22:49.493 --> 22:51.620
"The Planet Of The Apes."

22:53.664 --> 22:55.082
And there goes

22:53.664 --> 22:55.082
another nice couple.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.709
[laughing]

22:56.750 --> 22:58.669
Come on. I'll make you

22:56.750 --> 22:58.669
some vegetables.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.968
[theme music]
