WEBVTT

00:11.053 --> 00:12.930
It's all just a cycle.

00:13.013 --> 00:17.601
Panama does one thing, Reagan does
another, Soviets do something else,

00:17.684 --> 00:19.394
and then Reagan's got to respond

00:19.478 --> 00:22.147
so that he shows the public
he's standing his ground.

00:22.231 --> 00:24.650
Honestly, at this point,
I just tune the whole thing out.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.248
Flight.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.668
Jamestown is showing
a depressurization event.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.463
That can't be right. Raise Rossi.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.174
Jamestown, come in.

00:50.968 --> 00:52.761
Jamestown, do you read?

00:53.512 --> 00:54.763
What's going on?

00:55.264 --> 00:57.057
Pressure issue on Jamestown.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.727
Jamestown, we're showing readings
of a depressurization event.

01:00.811 --> 01:05.147
Ops/Comm cabin pressure is
less than one PSI. Do you copy?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.234
-Jamestown, do you--
-Jamestown here.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.987
We've been having some issues
with our sensors.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.197
Think we've finally got it under control.

01:12.281 --> 01:15.033
Ops/Comm pressure is returning to normal.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.660
Just a faulty sensor.

01:17.369 --> 01:19.830
Copy that, Jamestown.
Thanks for the clarification.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.791
Okay. No problem, Houston.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.175
Good.

01:34.887 --> 01:37.598
They are not aware of the situation.

01:38.432 --> 01:39.474
Locked.

01:45.147 --> 01:48.400
Leave this hallway depressurized
to protect our flank.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.867
We want they release
Rolan Baranov. Where is he?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.620
Like I said, I don't know.

02:00.287 --> 02:02.456
Like I said, you help us…

02:02.539 --> 02:04.416
I would. I just don't know.

02:11.215 --> 02:12.758
-You will help us.
-Wait.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.134
I'm just tryin' to--

02:16.136 --> 02:17.513
Wait--

04:02.075 --> 04:03.076
Skipper?

04:04.328 --> 04:05.329
Yeah?

04:06.788 --> 04:08.665
It's your turn to get some shut-eye.

04:10.834 --> 04:12.544
No. I'm okay.

04:22.471 --> 04:24.181
Sir, you haven't slept since TLI.

04:25.349 --> 04:27.267
How far are we away
from the blockade line?

04:27.851 --> 04:29.144
Two hours, 15.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.191
Where's Buran?

04:34.274 --> 04:38.570
Already in low lunar orbit. On course to
intercept us when we cross the blockade.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.626
Give me updated numbers for LOIT
and delta-V total.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.213
You okay, sir?

04:58.131 --> 05:00.050
Not if you keep
looking at me like that, I'm not.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.010
You get back to work, Mr. Piscotty.

05:03.387 --> 05:04.388
Yes, sir.

05:25.784 --> 05:27.786
What's the latest with Apollo-Soyuz?

05:27.870 --> 05:32.207
The Soviets are asking for more time
before docking. Again.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.753
We can't just keep orbiting ad infinitum
while they get their act together.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.381
What are they saying
the holdup is this time?

05:39.464 --> 05:41.341
No official reason was given.

05:41.425 --> 05:45.596
Sergei said they need more time
before docking. That's all.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.891
Which is what they've been saying
for the past five hours.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.476
I know. I know.

05:51.560 --> 05:55.355
But I still think this can work.

05:55.439 --> 05:58.525
I don't know why they don't just admit
it's to do with the lunar blockade.

05:58.609 --> 05:59.693
Save us all some time.

06:00.402 --> 06:04.531
What's the latest with that? Have we
crossed the blockade line yet? Is Buran…

06:04.615 --> 06:08.076
Margo, you know I can't get into
the details. It's a classified operation.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.915
How are we supposed to make
informed decisions

06:12.998 --> 06:15.709
without knowing what's
really going on in there?

06:15.792 --> 06:17.336
I--

06:18.170 --> 06:20.506
I'm sorry. I wish I could, but…

06:22.174 --> 06:24.510
Just making friends
left and right, Wilson.

06:24.593 --> 06:28.347
Speaking of which, you want to
give Apollo the bad news, Bill?

06:32.768 --> 06:36.230
Apollo, that's a no-go
on the coplanar rendezvous burn.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.690
Star City's still dragging their feet.

06:38.774 --> 06:40.859
We'll give you an update
as soon as we have one,

06:40.943 --> 06:42.736
but that's another orbit on deck.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.821
-Sorry, guys.
-Copy that, Houston.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.578
Damn it.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.163
Hurry up and wait, huh?

07:00.963 --> 07:03.090
Guess it's one more trip around the world.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.810
It's really depressurized out there.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.770
What the hell is going on?

07:16.854 --> 07:18.480
Maybe a meteorite hit the base.

07:18.564 --> 07:22.818
Maybe, but no one's responding
on the comm. It's like they all vanished.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.572
Not everyone.

07:26.655 --> 07:29.408
Try to get their attention.
Let them know we're--

07:29.908 --> 07:30.909
Get down.

08:10.657 --> 08:12.659
Jesus, Gordo, what the fuck is going on?

08:12.743 --> 08:13.994
I don't know.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.997
Jamestown Base, this is your commander.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.791
I am being held by the Soviets.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.418
They have not harmed me.

08:21.502 --> 08:27.299
They are offering an exchange, me for
their fellow cosmonaut, Rolan Baranov.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.468
Don't do it. Don't do it--

08:36.140 --> 08:38.059
We must do what they say.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.812
No. Not a chance.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.606
Isn't this at least worth discussing?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.275
No. There's nothing to discuss.

08:45.359 --> 08:48.695
The president has given this man asylum,
and we are not giving him back.

08:48.779 --> 08:49.947
Seriously?

08:50.030 --> 08:53.867
They'll kill Rossi. We are outmanned.
Two of your marines aren't even here.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.662
They're still guarding
that stupid goddamn claim site.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.997
You really think
we can take them at their word?

08:59.081 --> 09:02.000
They get him back,
they'll probably just kill Rossi anyway.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.380
They won't leave… until they have me.

09:20.102 --> 09:21.520
Then we make 'em leave.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.010
Wow, this place is impressive.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.803
It's not too shabby, huh?

09:55.179 --> 09:58.640
It's nothing compared to what Trace
and Ed wake up to every morning, but…

09:58.724 --> 10:01.101
Well, for us earthlings,
it's really something.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.562
-Morning, Mr. Cleveland.
-Morning.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.232
Hey, do you…

10:09.234 --> 10:11.445
Do you ever worry about Ed
when he's up there?

10:12.863 --> 10:13.864
Of course.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.825
You know,
I just try not to think about it.

10:18.368 --> 10:21.246
We all find ways to manage.

10:22.331 --> 10:23.707
Pot really helps.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.211
I bet.

10:28.754 --> 10:32.174
You don't have anything to worry about,
though. Tracy is as tough as they come.

10:32.674 --> 10:33.675
Yeah.

10:35.636 --> 10:38.514
Tell me. What is the next big move
for Karen Baldwin?

10:38.597 --> 10:41.016
'Cause you're about to make yourself
a nice chunk of change.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.809
I'm not too sure.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.646
We're just right on in here.

10:47.731 --> 10:48.732
Okay.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.365
If you're having second thoughts,
we can stop right here.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.450
I don't want you to do anything
you're uncomfortable with.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.743
No…

11:00.702 --> 11:03.372
It's okay. I'm ready.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.041
Right this way then.

11:10.254 --> 11:12.965
Houston,
approaching lunar orbit insertion.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.175
Copy that, Pathfinder.

11:15.926 --> 11:17.845
We're about to cross the blockade point.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.474
Entering orbit in five, four,

11:23.058 --> 11:26.311
three, two, one.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.031
Pathfinder, Houston.
We show you in lunar orbit.

11:39.616 --> 11:40.742
Any sign of Buran?

11:42.035 --> 11:44.288
Negative.
They're not showing up on our radar.

11:45.122 --> 11:46.498
Where the hell are they?

11:55.465 --> 11:57.676
Houston, we have no radar contact
with Buran.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.847
Pathfinder, wait one while
we check with Goddard for an update.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.937
Houston, any sign of Buran?

12:09.605 --> 12:12.024
Buran has crossed
to the far side of the moon.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.234
We can't track their orbit
until they reemerge.

12:15.611 --> 12:18.197
-They were bluffing.
-You don't know that.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.573
There's still over two hours

12:19.656 --> 12:22.534
till we're able to deliver
Sea Dragon's cargo to the lunar surface.

12:22.618 --> 12:23.660
Come on.

12:23.744 --> 12:27.831
Our badass nuclear-powered space fighter
scared those Russkies back to their cave.

12:27.915 --> 12:31.960
All right. Sally's not wrong.
Let's stay vigilant here.

12:35.005 --> 12:37.508
You were warned not to cross the blockade.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.843
Now, Yuri, you're being unreasonable.

12:40.844 --> 12:44.640
We were quite firm, Ronald.
Sea Dragon cannot enter lunar orbit.

12:44.723 --> 12:46.225
Well, we were very clear

12:46.308 --> 12:48.936
the United States
does not recognize your blockade.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.147
It is not a blockade.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.275
It is a quarantine
against offensive weapons.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.028
There are no weapons on Sea Dragon, Yuri.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.989
And it is provocative actions like this
that lead--

13:03.200 --> 13:06.245
The US was first
to shoot a gun on the moon.

13:06.328 --> 13:09.122
The first to kill someone on the moon.

13:09.206 --> 13:11.875
If the US fires on Buran,

13:11.959 --> 13:16.088
we will have no choice
but to respond in a substantial way.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.802
The Soviet Northern Fleet
off the coast of Panama

13:21.885 --> 13:25.055
has 30 targets in the southern US.

13:25.138 --> 13:29.560
If Buran is destroyed,
we will have no choice but to strike back.

13:29.643 --> 13:32.145
You know our missiles in Western Europe--

13:33.355 --> 13:35.357
Our position is clear.

13:43.657 --> 13:46.535
Further signs
of escalation in the Atlantic today,

13:46.618 --> 13:49.788
as the Russian Northern Fleet
has taken offensive positions

13:49.872 --> 13:51.874
off the Central American coast.

13:51.957 --> 13:55.419
US carriers have been deployed
in the Gulf of Mexico

13:55.502 --> 13:58.422
as people across the nation
begin to stockpile supplies

13:58.505 --> 14:01.049
in anticipation of an all-out conflict,

14:01.133 --> 14:05.012
causing runs on everything
from bottled water to toilet paper.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.683
We must again delay the docking,
I'm afraid.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.103
Why?

14:15.939 --> 14:19.902
All I can say is that we need more time.
You must hear me.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.778
That's not good enough, Sergei.

14:22.279 --> 14:25.824
Every time we're supposed to dock,
you come up with another delay.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.410
And we both know
what this is really about.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.455
I'm sorry, Margo.

14:35.209 --> 14:39.838
Best I can do is to give you our
state vector for next docking opportunity.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.342
Fine, go ahead.

14:43.425 --> 14:47.012
07 853

14:47.721 --> 14:49.264
236

14:49.348 --> 14:52.059
58… 72.

14:57.439 --> 14:58.607
Thank you, Margo.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.818
He's so full of shit.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.154
If this is a lost cause,
I want to bring our people home.

15:04.238 --> 15:07.449
Every trip around the Earth increases
the chances that something will go wrong.

15:07.533 --> 15:11.328
I hate to say it, but she's right.
Takes two to handshake.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.790
Ellen, we've gone through too much
to just give up on this now.

15:14.873 --> 15:18.961
Up until a month ago, you thought
this whole thing was a waste of time.

15:19.545 --> 15:22.965
Yeah, well, a month ago
we weren't on the brink of war.

15:23.048 --> 15:25.676
This is what Tom was talkin' about.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.053
Just give me one more orbit.

15:33.642 --> 15:36.144
Ninety minutes. And then they come home.

15:42.317 --> 15:46.238
Five minutes to the coplanar burn
and docking initiation, Apollo.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.781
Copy that, Houston.

15:47.865 --> 15:50.325
Strausser, tell 'em they won't be docking.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.244
Russkies are kicking the can again.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.872
One more time around.
After that, we're pulling the plug.

15:54.955 --> 15:57.291
Just like that?
No, everyone has worked so hard.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.084
You can't just say
it's over like it's nothing.

15:59.168 --> 16:01.295
Bill, who is this?
Why is she speaking to me?

16:01.378 --> 16:02.462
She apologizes.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.882
-No, I don't.
-Yes, you do.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.011
I like this one.

16:14.683 --> 16:18.562
Apollo, some news over here.

16:18.645 --> 16:22.524
Unfortunately we're gonna need
for you to proceed with another orbit.

16:22.608 --> 16:25.027
The docking with Soyuz
has been delayed again.

16:25.611 --> 16:28.822
We didn't come all this way just to wave
at each other through the window.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.741
I hear you, Apollo, I do.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.285
Going off VOX, Houston.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.453
Copy.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.706
Raise the Soyuz.

16:40.334 --> 16:44.171
Soyuz, Apollo? Do you read? Soyuz, Apollo?

16:44.254 --> 16:46.048
Soyuz, copy.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.716
What are you guys doin' over there?

16:47.799 --> 16:51.428
Comrade Orlov continues
to struggle with space adaptation.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.806
-Still puking his guts out, huh?
-Yeah.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.475
Is not joke.

17:00.479 --> 17:03.899
I'm starting to get the feeling this
handshake isn't gonna happen, Stepan.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.818
Yes. I also have this feeling.

17:08.403 --> 17:12.074
Guess it was stupid to think they'd ever
go through with this in the first place.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.451
At least we got a nice view.

17:59.454 --> 18:01.206
-Hello?
-Sergei?

18:01.874 --> 18:03.667
I'm sorry for this diversion.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.003
I could not speak openly
over normal channels.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.839
I understand, but I'm puttin' myself
on the line over here

18:08.922 --> 18:10.048
keeping this docking alive,

18:10.132 --> 18:12.426
and every time I do,
you pull the rug out from under me.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.553
You need to come clean with me,
Sergei, right--

18:14.636 --> 18:17.097
I'm sorry, Margo.
I'm doing the best I can.

18:17.181 --> 18:18.557
That's not good enough.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.810
You need to tell me what's really
goin' on. I can't do this by myself.

18:25.022 --> 18:27.733
We are having avionics issues.

18:27.816 --> 18:28.817
Avionics?

18:28.901 --> 18:31.278
You're sayin' this is a technical problem?

18:31.361 --> 18:32.362
Yes.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.949
I don't believe you.
Why didn't you say this earlier?

18:36.950 --> 18:42.080
If I were to admit to United States
that Soyuz were malfunctioning,

18:42.164 --> 18:44.124
Andropov would cancel docking.
I know this.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.627
-Please, Margo, please.
-Please deposit 50 cents…

18:46.710 --> 18:48.337
You must give me more time.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.006
We have almost resolved the problem.
You must trust me.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.970
I trusted you once before, and you guys
sent an armed Buran to the moon.

18:57.054 --> 18:59.556
Pathfinder is also armed, is it not?

18:59.640 --> 19:02.559
That's not the point, Sergei.
You took advantage--

19:02.643 --> 19:06.813
No, Margo. I'm like you. On the outside,
trying to do the best I can.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.235
One orbit, that's all I can manage.

19:12.486 --> 19:13.820
Margo--

19:31.129 --> 19:32.631
Morning, Miss Madison.

19:38.512 --> 19:40.597
The United States and Soviet Union

19:40.681 --> 19:43.725
have postponed
the expected handshake yet again.

19:43.809 --> 19:45.102
No word yet as to when--

19:45.185 --> 19:48.313
And what I'm hearing now
from sources in the Pentagon

19:48.397 --> 19:51.108
is the canal standoff is very much linked
to Sea Dragon…

19:51.191 --> 19:52.526
There's nothin' on Jamestown.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.487
It's all Apollo-Soyuz
or this blockade crap.

19:55.571 --> 19:58.365
-You check CBS?
-I checked them all.

20:08.375 --> 20:09.960
You know, last time I was up here…

20:11.461 --> 20:14.131
all we had was six tapes
of Bob Newhart to keep us company.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.799
Bob Newhart?

20:15.883 --> 20:18.760
We watched 'em so many times,
damn near memorized the whole thing.

20:19.553 --> 20:22.014
When the Betamax broke,
we even used to act them out.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.432
Really?

20:23.515 --> 20:26.643
-Even Ed?
-Yeah. Yeah.

20:26.727 --> 20:28.103
Course, he only ever played Bob.

20:28.896 --> 20:30.355
Of course.

20:34.902 --> 20:36.862
Yeah, didn't have much else to do.

20:37.613 --> 20:39.781
And those days just stretched out forever.

20:40.616 --> 20:41.825
Yeah.

20:41.909 --> 20:44.036
You know the only thing
I really looked forward to?

20:45.370 --> 20:47.414
Was fighting with you on that damn thing.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.336
Yeah, we always had fire.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.046
Yeah, we did.

21:03.305 --> 21:08.018
Hey, there was this old S-Band
directional antenna.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.186
Linked us to JSC.

21:15.234 --> 21:17.694
You know how to
sweet-talk a girl, don't you?

21:19.404 --> 21:23.033
Yeah. It's just when
Ops/Comm went operational,

21:23.116 --> 21:27.120
they routed all base communications
through the new high-gain antenna.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.498
It's more bandwidth and all, but…

21:29.581 --> 21:32.334
But maybe the old antenna still works.

21:32.918 --> 21:34.670
There's only one way to find out.

22:28.891 --> 22:30.767
Hub's fully depressurized.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.112
Covering right.

22:42.196 --> 22:45.449
Webster,
you see them move, radio immediately.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.410
Lopez. On me.

22:57.628 --> 22:59.129
Clear.

23:06.011 --> 23:07.638
Okay, stay alert.

23:07.721 --> 23:10.724
When we round the corner, I'll cover.

23:13.268 --> 23:16.146
You set the breaching charges
on the Ops/Comm hatch.

23:16.230 --> 23:17.606
Copy that.

23:34.665 --> 23:35.874
Goddamn it.

23:38.836 --> 23:40.712
I should have lost a few more pounds.

23:40.796 --> 23:42.589
You're doing great, Gordo. Keep goin'.

23:42.673 --> 23:43.757
Wait.

23:43.841 --> 23:45.133
I think I see it.

23:49.513 --> 23:51.598
Yeah, think I got it.

23:57.855 --> 23:58.981
Yeah.

24:03.193 --> 24:04.611
Oh, man.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.321
Okay.

24:06.947 --> 24:09.741
That should be it.

24:09.825 --> 24:11.159
Fuck.

24:11.243 --> 24:13.245
What?

24:13.328 --> 24:14.454
What is it?

24:16.290 --> 24:17.416
Shit.

24:18.000 --> 24:20.085
-Trace?
-Cavalry's here.

24:20.169 --> 24:21.545
Thank God.

24:21.962 --> 24:23.380
I can see Vance.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.382
I'm not sure who's with him, but--

24:36.476 --> 24:39.813
Vance! Damn it,
they can't hear me. Vance!

24:41.732 --> 24:43.984
I'll be a son of a bitch. Look who it is.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.277
America's sweetheart.

24:48.572 --> 24:49.573
Lopez.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.628
Put eyes on that hatch.
Don't get famous.

25:03.504 --> 25:04.796
Aye, aye, skip.

25:09.551 --> 25:11.553
Oh, my God. Vance.

25:11.637 --> 25:12.971
Vance!

25:15.933 --> 25:17.184
Vance!

25:17.267 --> 25:19.811
Vance! Vance! Come on!

25:22.272 --> 25:25.108
Russian! Turn--

25:32.824 --> 25:35.244
Vance? Vance, come in.

25:38.163 --> 25:39.706
Vance is down. Jesus.

25:52.469 --> 25:54.388
I'm hit.

26:33.802 --> 26:35.179
How bad is it?

26:35.262 --> 26:38.223
I'm okay, I think.
But my suit's losing pressure.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.105
He shot him.

26:45.689 --> 26:48.233
He just… shot him.

26:55.908 --> 26:59.244
-There was nothing I could do. He just--
-Pressure up.

27:00.287 --> 27:02.831
Hang on. I'm gonna repressurize.

27:23.185 --> 27:24.311
Flight.

27:25.854 --> 27:27.606
-Pressure again?
-No.

27:27.689 --> 27:29.816
This is real weird.

27:29.900 --> 27:32.945
The nuclear reactor's primary
coolant pump has shut down.

27:34.988 --> 27:36.532
Have they radioed down for assistance?

27:36.615 --> 27:39.201
Negative. Rossi said that there
was gonna be a communication hold

27:39.284 --> 27:41.745
for an hour or two
while they worked on some maintenance.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.747
Override the hold
and get Rossi on the line.

27:43.830 --> 27:46.250
We need to make sure
this isn't what it looks like.

27:46.333 --> 27:48.168
Jamestown, this is Houston.

27:48.794 --> 27:52.381
Did you command an emergency shutdown
of the primary reactor coolant loop?

27:56.093 --> 27:57.219
Jamestown?

27:59.638 --> 28:00.681
Come in, Jamestown.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.857
A lot going on here, Margo.
What do you need?

28:10.983 --> 28:12.776
We've got a problem at Jamestown.

28:12.860 --> 28:15.946
The primary coolant loop
for the nuclear reactor has shut down.

28:16.029 --> 28:17.656
What does Al Rossi think?

28:17.739 --> 28:19.533
Jamestown is not responding to comms.

28:19.616 --> 28:20.909
Not responding?

28:20.993 --> 28:22.286
Radio silence.

28:23.036 --> 28:24.204
Christ.

28:24.288 --> 28:25.789
Could this be related to the defector?

28:25.873 --> 28:28.000
It may be a diversionary tactic
by the Russians.

28:28.083 --> 28:29.084
Whatever it is,

28:29.168 --> 28:32.588
there's a backup loop that should
compensate in cooling the reactor, so--

28:32.671 --> 28:34.047
It might not be that simple.

28:34.131 --> 28:35.132
What do you mean?

28:47.477 --> 28:48.854
There's a second reactor.

28:48.937 --> 28:50.147
What?

28:50.230 --> 28:52.399
Now, this is above
your security clearance,

28:52.482 --> 28:56.111
but the Pentagon used last month's
Sea Dragon payload as cover

28:56.195 --> 28:59.114
to bring a second reactor
to Jamestown to…

29:01.533 --> 29:03.452
Produce weapons-grade plutonium.

29:04.161 --> 29:08.874
Now, that reactor is hooked up
to the same primary coolant system,

29:08.957 --> 29:11.168
but due to national security priorities,

29:11.251 --> 29:14.379
we had to bring it online before
it was connected to the backup loop.

29:14.463 --> 29:17.174
Which means there's no fail-safe.

29:18.759 --> 29:20.385
It'll go into full meltdown.

29:25.307 --> 29:27.935
Forget for a moment

29:28.018 --> 29:32.231
just how nonsensical it is to have
nuclear weapons on the moon at all,

29:32.314 --> 29:34.441
but to keep this a secret
from the very people

29:34.525 --> 29:38.153
who are in charge of the safety
of that base, of this agency--

29:38.237 --> 29:41.281
Margo, this was a top-secret program
run through the Pentagon.

29:41.365 --> 29:44.034
I'm the director of JSC, goddamn it.

29:44.117 --> 29:45.994
Look, even if we wanted to tell you--

29:46.078 --> 29:48.247
We? You knew about this?

29:49.748 --> 29:51.875
-At the time--
-Don't waste your breath, Ellen.

29:51.959 --> 29:55.921
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got your nuclear meltdown to prevent!

29:56.421 --> 29:58.674
Margo. Margo.

30:06.849 --> 30:10.519
Houston, this is--
Houston. Do you read?

30:11.687 --> 30:14.147
Houston, this is…

30:17.276 --> 30:18.902
Do you read?

30:18.986 --> 30:22.906
Houston, this is Jamestown One.
Do you read?

30:23.866 --> 30:25.409
This is Jamestown. Can you hear?

30:27.244 --> 30:28.704
Do you read?

30:28.787 --> 30:29.788
Hello?

30:29.872 --> 30:31.373
Houston, do you read?

30:35.794 --> 30:37.504
Houston, do you read?

30:42.384 --> 30:43.468
Tracy.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.053
Hi.

31:04.573 --> 31:06.658
We've been stuck in the galley
since it started,

31:06.742 --> 31:09.912
and they're keeping the area just outside
the module depressurized.

31:09.995 --> 31:11.663
Have you been in
communication with anyone?

31:11.747 --> 31:15.167
Negative. They shut down the comms,
and we don't have any suits in here.

31:17.461 --> 31:19.379
What is it? What's going on?

31:22.841 --> 31:26.011
The nuclear reactor's control computer
has gone off-line.

31:26.094 --> 31:28.388
The reactor is overheating and fast.

31:28.472 --> 31:30.557
-In approximately 45 minutes…
-Jesus.

31:30.641 --> 31:33.435
…it will cause a massive nuclear
meltdown, killing everyone on the base

31:33.519 --> 31:37.940
and rendering Shackleton
uninhabitable for a thousand years.

31:38.023 --> 31:39.525
Jesus Christ.

31:41.068 --> 31:43.612
Okay. What can we do?

31:43.695 --> 31:47.991
The backup coolant loop has its own
control computer that is functioning.

31:48.075 --> 31:50.911
Normally, we'd just have you
switch it over in Ops/Comm.

31:50.994 --> 31:52.037
Shit.

31:52.120 --> 31:55.123
HAB SYS says that it's possible
to swap out

31:55.207 --> 31:59.461
the cable connectors from the backup
computer to the primary loop.

31:59.545 --> 32:02.214
You're talking about hot-wiring
a nuclear reactor here?

32:02.297 --> 32:03.298
Pretty much.

32:03.382 --> 32:05.592
All right. So what are we waiting for?

32:05.676 --> 32:08.720
The cable connectors
are outside of Ops/Comm.

32:08.804 --> 32:11.723
So, without suits,
there is no way for you to reach them.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.517
So what are we supposed to do?

32:13.600 --> 32:16.061
Are we just supposed to sit here
until the whole thing blows?

32:21.316 --> 32:23.235
How far are those cables from us?

32:23.318 --> 32:25.028
About 25 meters.

32:26.947 --> 32:27.990
I think I can get to 'em.

32:28.073 --> 32:29.199
-What?
-What?

32:29.283 --> 32:32.411
I can cover 25 meters
in less than 10 seconds.

32:32.494 --> 32:33.912
Hell you can.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.247
-I started jogging again.
-No--

32:35.330 --> 32:39.376
Jogging? We're talking about running on
the surface of the moon without a suit on.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.044
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

32:43.172 --> 32:45.299
Gordo, I appreciate the--

32:45.382 --> 32:48.427
It's just-- It's not a possibility.

32:48.510 --> 32:51.722
Well, maybe it could be. Technically.

32:52.514 --> 32:55.267
I mean, he'd have 15 seconds
before he lost consciousness.

32:55.350 --> 33:00.731
If we could jury-rig some sort of
protection for him against the vacuum,

33:00.814 --> 33:02.524
maybe we could do this.

33:04.860 --> 33:06.737
Y'all know what's in the galley.

33:09.156 --> 33:11.909
Help me make as close to a suit
as I can get.

33:11.992 --> 33:14.286
All we know is there's
been an attack on Jamestown

33:14.369 --> 33:15.704
with multiple casualties.

33:15.787 --> 33:17.748
I put every one of them
up on that base.

33:17.831 --> 33:19.583
Gordo, Tracy.

33:21.376 --> 33:22.669
Helena Webster…

33:23.629 --> 33:24.671
Is she okay?

33:24.755 --> 33:26.715
We don't have an accurate picture yet.

33:26.798 --> 33:29.718
Why would they attack Jamestown?
Is this because of the blockade?

33:29.801 --> 33:30.802
It's unclear.

33:30.886 --> 33:34.056
It could be an effort to recapture
the defector or part of a broader plan.

33:34.139 --> 33:36.808
Does it matter? They attacked
'cause they smelled weakness.

33:36.892 --> 33:38.477
Trying to take the moon for themselves,

33:38.560 --> 33:40.938
just like they did with Eastern Europe
and Southeast Asia.

33:41.021 --> 33:43.524
I guarantee you this lunar blockade
is part of it.

33:43.607 --> 33:46.151
Exactly.
And we're fighting on multiple fronts now,

33:46.235 --> 33:48.445
and you're our last line
of defense up there.

33:48.529 --> 33:51.740
-Has Buran come out from hiding yet?
-We expected them to reemerge

33:51.823 --> 33:54.785
from the far side of the moon by now,
but we haven't seen them yet.

33:54.868 --> 33:57.746
-They're back there waiting for us.
-It looks that way.

33:57.829 --> 34:01.625
They must have slowed their speed.
They're probably in an elliptical orbit.

34:01.708 --> 34:03.168
Why would they do that?

34:03.252 --> 34:06.213
We'll be isolated.
Unable to communicate with Houston.

34:09.132 --> 34:12.803
Sir, if we're to encounter them
while we're back there?

34:12.886 --> 34:14.847
Ellen just got word from the White House.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.473
Your orders stand. If you are to--

34:17.139 --> 34:19.059
-We're losing you, sir.
-Nearing Loss of Signal.

34:19.141 --> 34:21.645
Fifteen seconds till we cross over
to the far side of the moon.

34:21.728 --> 34:25.440
I'll keep it simple.
Protect Sea Dragon at all costs.

34:25.524 --> 34:27.650
-Yes, sir.
-Approaching Loss of Signal.

34:27.734 --> 34:28.944
Godspeed, Pathfinder.

34:34.574 --> 34:36.952
As the astronauts
and cosmonauts of Apollo-Soyuz

34:37.034 --> 34:38.911
await their handshake in space,

34:38.996 --> 34:40.789
tensions between the two countries
here on Earth

34:40.873 --> 34:43.417
remain at heights not seen in two decades,

34:43.500 --> 34:46.043
all the way back
to the Cuban missile crisis.

34:46.128 --> 34:49.882
The long-simmering conflict seems to be
on the verge of turning

34:49.965 --> 34:52.717
from what has come to be
known as a cold war

34:52.801 --> 34:55.219
into something much more dangerous.

34:55.304 --> 34:58.640
Across the nation, people are growing
increasingly concerned

34:58.724 --> 35:01.393
about the events of the past several days.

35:01.476 --> 35:04.146
Musician and activist John Lennon
drew tens of thousands…

35:04.229 --> 35:05.230
Hi, Kel.

35:05.314 --> 35:07.983
…to his concert for peace
at Madison Square Garden, saying, quote…

35:08.066 --> 35:09.484
Why are we closed?

35:09.568 --> 35:12.696
Because the bar isn't ours anymore.

35:13.572 --> 35:14.615
What do you mean?

35:14.698 --> 35:17.910
I sold it this morning.
I just signed the paperwork.

35:19.244 --> 35:20.662
Seriously?

35:21.330 --> 35:23.832
Yeah, it all happened very fast.
But I sold it.

35:24.625 --> 35:25.751
Why?

35:26.251 --> 35:29.546
I got a really great offer, and it…

35:30.631 --> 35:32.799
I don't know,
just felt like the right time.

35:35.135 --> 35:36.428
Cheers.

35:36.512 --> 35:37.513
Wow.

35:42.392 --> 35:43.727
I'm gonna miss it.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.146
I'm not.

35:50.192 --> 35:52.361
So what are you gonna do now?

35:54.279 --> 35:55.364
I don't know.

35:56.198 --> 36:00.661
I don't have any idea. I've got nothing.

36:01.411 --> 36:03.247
And it feels damn good.

36:04.456 --> 36:06.750
I can't really picture you
sitting on the couch,

36:06.834 --> 36:08.794
eating ice cream and watching TV all day.

36:08.877 --> 36:10.879
Okay, well, that's not gonna happen.

36:13.507 --> 36:14.883
I don't know.

36:15.467 --> 36:20.722
Maybe I'll travel. Go to India.
I've always wanted to see the elephants.

36:22.975 --> 36:24.685
Or maybe I'll go back to college.

36:27.062 --> 36:28.188
Mom.

36:28.272 --> 36:29.523
What?

36:29.606 --> 36:31.233
For what?

36:31.316 --> 36:35.696
Well, you know, a master's
in business is very useful.

36:36.572 --> 36:38.031
And where would you go?

36:38.115 --> 36:40.742
I was thinking William & Mary.

36:50.669 --> 36:52.713
Are you and Dad getting a divorce?

36:55.799 --> 36:57.759
What? Kelly, that's not--

36:57.843 --> 37:02.681
I saw you guys fighting in the driveway,
and William & Mary is in Virginia.

37:02.764 --> 37:06.185
And you're talking about all these plans,
and none of them seem to involve Dad.

37:08.437 --> 37:12.691
Okay, Kelly, your father went
back to space. I'm just trying to figure--

37:13.400 --> 37:14.443
What is that?

37:15.485 --> 37:19.031
It sounds like an air raid siren.
I'm sure that it's just a drill.

37:19.114 --> 37:21.450
Everything's gonna be okay, all right?
And I don't--

37:21.533 --> 37:24.578
This is a message
from the Emergency Broadcast System.

37:24.661 --> 37:26.747
In the wake of events
in the Gulf of Mexico…

37:26.830 --> 37:31.043
-That doesn't seem like a drill.
-Let's head downstairs, okay? Come on.

37:31.126 --> 37:32.961
This is not a drill.

37:33.629 --> 37:37.508
In the wake of events
in the Gulf of Mexico…

37:37.591 --> 37:40.469
He will have about 15 seconds total

37:40.552 --> 37:43.805
to reach these cable connectors here,
swap them out…

37:43.889 --> 37:45.891
Then reboot the computer
with this switch here

37:45.974 --> 37:49.102
and get back to the air lock
before he loses consciousness.

37:50.437 --> 37:52.606
Best we have, people.
So we gotta work with it.

38:05.035 --> 38:06.411
We're at DEFCON 2.

38:06.495 --> 38:10.123
The Soviet fleet off the coast of Panama
is threatening the southern United States.

38:10.207 --> 38:13.961
Nelson thinks there could be up
to ten nukes targeting Houston alone.

38:14.044 --> 38:15.963
Christ. It's all falling apart, isn't it?

38:19.550 --> 38:21.510
All right, everyone, listen up.

38:22.094 --> 38:26.473
The doors to the bomb shelters
are at the rear of building 30.

38:26.557 --> 38:28.851
Anyone who wants to should go now.

38:50.455 --> 38:52.249
Okay.

38:52.332 --> 38:54.585
Turn that thing off. Let's keep going.

38:54.668 --> 38:58.672
George, Alicia, get me the list
of every item in the Jamestown galley.

38:58.755 --> 39:02.718
Sedgey, help me figure out how to use
that stuff to make a counterpressure suit.

39:02.801 --> 39:05.387
-We gotta do what we can to protect Gordo.
-Yes, ma'am.

39:05.470 --> 39:08.182
-Margo, we have--
-I know. I know.

39:10.934 --> 39:12.811
We have to call off Apollo-Soyuz.

39:13.562 --> 39:15.647
Bill, raise Apollo.

39:15.731 --> 39:17.357
Tell them it's time to come home,

39:17.441 --> 39:20.777
and calculate their reentry
at the next window.

39:20.861 --> 39:21.945
Yes, ma'am.

39:25.574 --> 39:29.119
Sorry, Dani. We'll get you your
reentry protocols in the next few minutes.

39:31.413 --> 39:33.582
That was a waste of time and money.

39:39.171 --> 39:42.966
Soyuz, this is Apollo. Come in.

39:45.219 --> 39:46.887
This is Apollo. Come in.

39:50.349 --> 39:53.227
Stepan, it's Dani. Have you heard?

39:55.395 --> 39:56.688
Yes. I have.

40:00.234 --> 40:03.320
You know, my husband Clayton
used to say…

40:04.154 --> 40:07.491
"When people tell you
who they are, listen."

40:08.075 --> 40:10.202
I don't understand.

40:12.079 --> 40:13.580
I guess what I'm saying is…

40:14.540 --> 40:18.377
I am tired of pretending I can't hear it.

40:19.795 --> 40:21.421
Tired of being used.

40:22.005 --> 40:27.010
Being told to smile,
keep quiet, be patient.

40:27.094 --> 40:28.804
We'll get to you next time around.

40:29.555 --> 40:31.348
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

40:31.431 --> 40:34.977
No, I'm happy
with Soviet space program.

40:35.936 --> 40:37.020
Come on.

40:38.105 --> 40:40.232
I know you don't like this
any more than I do.

40:41.024 --> 40:43.151
At least Laika got to do her mission.

40:44.611 --> 40:47.114
Danielle, what are you saying?

40:49.199 --> 40:50.909
What are they gonna do to us?

40:51.952 --> 40:57.040
We are a hundred miles above Earth,
floating around in these two old tin cans.

40:57.124 --> 40:59.835
Don't you want to just go for it?

41:04.965 --> 41:09.344
And now look for the stowed oxygen
masks that have the full face covering.

41:10.262 --> 41:13.182
And you gotta grab
all the rolls of duct tape you can find.

41:13.849 --> 41:14.892
What's that for?

41:14.975 --> 41:16.935
You're gonna wrap yourself in it.

41:17.519 --> 41:18.896
Seriously?

41:18.979 --> 41:21.440
Beats aluminum foil.
That was the first idea.

41:21.523 --> 41:26.195
Now, you are gonna wrap every
single inch that you can see of your skin.

41:26.278 --> 41:28.363
Every single inch.
Because anything that is exposed

41:28.447 --> 41:31.742
is gonna balloon up
the second you set foot on the surface.

41:32.784 --> 41:35.829
It's also close to
200 degrees Fahrenheit out there,

41:35.913 --> 41:38.123
which is gonna cause
the adhesive of that tape to melt.

41:38.207 --> 41:40.083
So, you know, move your ass.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.336
Yeah. Got it.

41:42.920 --> 41:46.924
And remember, you gotta
breathe out all the air in your lungs,

41:47.007 --> 41:48.008
or they will burst.

41:48.091 --> 41:50.969
So you will have just 15 seconds
before you pass out.

41:54.806 --> 41:56.099
Gordo?

41:56.183 --> 41:59.895
If you want to change your mind,
I am sure they will understand.

42:03.315 --> 42:05.526
No. I'm good.

42:06.026 --> 42:08.820
-'Cause once you're out there, there's--
-Yeah. Thanks, Mol.

42:14.535 --> 42:16.954
I don't know
if we're gonna have enough.

42:17.037 --> 42:19.206
-There's plenty.
-Not for both of us.

42:21.041 --> 42:23.669
-Trace, you're not--
-The hell I'm not, Gordo.

42:23.752 --> 42:27.631
This is too important. You don't
pull this off, and everyone up here dies.

42:28.215 --> 42:30.634
American, Russian, all of us.

42:30.717 --> 42:34.555
Look, maybe if you only had to
swap the cable, you could make it back,

42:34.638 --> 42:37.599
but there is no way you can do this
and reach that power switch.

42:37.683 --> 42:39.852
It's suicide, and you know it.

42:39.935 --> 42:42.771
But if we both go,
we have a shot at making it back.

42:46.024 --> 42:48.986
But if we don't. Danny, Jimmy.

42:50.988 --> 42:54.032
Don't you dare make me tell our boys
their daddy didn't have to die.

42:56.326 --> 42:57.494
Trace.

42:57.578 --> 42:58.954
End of discussion, Gordo.

42:59.037 --> 43:01.248
We can do this. Together.

43:02.165 --> 43:03.208
Let's go.

43:06.253 --> 43:07.754
Sources inside the White House

43:07.838 --> 43:11.091
tell us the president has boarded
Air Force One as a precautionary measure

43:11.175 --> 43:14.136
and is currently somewhere over the US.

43:14.219 --> 43:18.307
Civil defense authorities have advised
the public to remain in fallout shelters

43:18.390 --> 43:20.517
or places of safety until further--

43:38.827 --> 43:40.495
I need to tell you something.

43:44.041 --> 43:45.667
But you can't get mad.

43:50.047 --> 43:51.048
Okay.

43:54.468 --> 43:56.345
I went to see my birth father.

44:02.809 --> 44:03.810
What?

44:05.020 --> 44:06.188
When?

44:06.271 --> 44:09.650
I didn't even know that you could.
How? I don't--

44:09.733 --> 44:11.568
He has a restaurant in Arlington.

44:12.694 --> 44:17.908
And I wrote to the orphanage in Vietnam
and… found out he immigrated here.

44:27.000 --> 44:28.252
I'm surprised.

44:30.546 --> 44:33.382
You never told me that you wanted
to meet him. I would've--

44:33.465 --> 44:35.217
I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys.

44:35.300 --> 44:37.553
I wasn't sure how or if I even could.

44:38.220 --> 44:39.304
Especially Dad.

44:39.888 --> 44:40.889
Yeah.

44:43.350 --> 44:45.269
And I didn't want you guys to think that--

44:45.352 --> 44:48.105
No. No, no. It's okay.

44:49.189 --> 44:51.233
It's perfectly normal to be curious.

44:54.903 --> 44:55.904
Tell me.

44:58.282 --> 44:59.575
What was he like?

45:00.158 --> 45:02.327
I didn't even talk to him.

45:03.161 --> 45:07.791
I couldn't. I just stood there,
waiting for…

45:08.542 --> 45:09.960
something.

45:10.043 --> 45:12.379
I'm not even sure what, like a connection.

45:14.548 --> 45:15.549
But…

45:17.426 --> 45:19.219
I was just another customer.

45:20.345 --> 45:24.850
And he has his own life, his own family.

45:26.935 --> 45:28.187
And so do I.

45:33.233 --> 45:34.401
Yeah.

45:56.715 --> 45:58.717
-That's weird.
-…your ship.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.719
We're getting a transmission from Houston.

46:00.802 --> 46:02.804
-Repeat.
-That's not Houston.

46:02.888 --> 46:05.599
You are in violation of Space Treaty.

46:05.682 --> 46:09.061
If Sea Dragon does not immediately
return to Earth,

46:09.144 --> 46:11.730
we will be forced to fire on your ship.

46:11.813 --> 46:12.856
Where are they?

46:12.940 --> 46:15.984
Radar shows 11:00 high, 3,000 kilometers.

46:16.068 --> 46:17.569
Jesus, they're closing in fast.

46:17.653 --> 46:20.489
How long till Sea Dragon
is within their missile range?

46:20.572 --> 46:21.657
Just over five minutes.

46:24.952 --> 46:28.455
Mr. Piscotty, open the payload bay doors.

46:47.766 --> 46:49.059
Apollo, Houston.

46:49.977 --> 46:53.063
Your pitch will be minus 49.3 degrees.

46:53.689 --> 46:56.608
Deorbit burn will begin
in T-minus five minutes.

46:57.776 --> 46:59.236
Negative, Houston.

47:00.779 --> 47:02.155
Come back, Apollo. Didn't read you.

47:02.239 --> 47:03.448
You did.

47:04.199 --> 47:07.369
We are going to proceed
with the docking maneuver.

47:10.497 --> 47:15.752
Apollo, you've been ordered to initiate
atmospheric entry in five minutes.

47:16.461 --> 47:19.840
And I am telling you
it ain't happening.

47:22.885 --> 47:24.887
-Flight?
-What's going on?

47:26.221 --> 47:27.222
Commander Poole,

47:27.306 --> 47:30.726
you have been given a direct order
to commence reentry procedure.

47:30.809 --> 47:33.353
And I am choosing to ignore it.

47:33.437 --> 47:37.232
Now, I suggest you all begin
docking procedures down there

47:37.316 --> 47:41.153
if you don't want us to crash
into each other on national television.

47:44.907 --> 47:47.743
She doesn't know everything
that's going on. Maybe if we tell her--

47:47.826 --> 47:50.996
I don't give a rat's ass what she knows.
She's been given an order.

47:51.079 --> 47:54.958
Guess this is what happens when astronauts
get away with disobeying orders.

47:56.293 --> 47:57.419
Tell her she can proceed.

47:59.421 --> 48:00.422
What?

48:01.006 --> 48:03.050
I thought the president
canceled the docking.

48:03.133 --> 48:05.761
He did. But I speak
for the president in this room,

48:05.844 --> 48:08.764
and I think one good thing
should happen on this shitty day.

48:12.100 --> 48:15.312
Okay. Tell them
to begin the docking procedure.

48:15.395 --> 48:16.480
Yes, ma'am.

48:18.440 --> 48:20.317
-Is this for real?
-It's about to be.

48:24.154 --> 48:25.656
Go ahead.

48:27.574 --> 48:32.120
Seriously? You want… me to tell them?

48:49.012 --> 48:51.598
Apollo, Houston.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.394
You are go for docking.

49:13.787 --> 49:15.706
Get him out of here!
They're coming through!

50:25.317 --> 50:27.027
You look fucking ridiculous.

50:29.279 --> 50:30.697
Take a look in the mirror.

50:31.740 --> 50:33.617
Kidding me? I make this suit sing.

50:37.871 --> 50:39.248
I love you, Trace.

50:44.920 --> 50:46.630
Yeah, I love you too, Gordo.

51:07.317 --> 51:08.694
Air lock is open.

51:08.777 --> 51:10.153
They have 15 seconds.

52:29.399 --> 52:30.943
They should've reached it by now.

52:34.571 --> 52:36.365
Wait, the reactor's stabilizing.

53:17.990 --> 53:19.658
It's taking too long.

54:16.840 --> 54:18.467
Hello, Apollo.

54:21.220 --> 54:23.096
So nice to see you again, my friend.

54:23.180 --> 54:24.431
The pleasure's all mine.

54:35.817 --> 54:37.653
Reactor has stabilized.

54:37.736 --> 54:39.488
The air lock has repressurized.

54:39.571 --> 54:40.948
They made it back.

55:19.319 --> 55:21.446
The president wants the Sixth Fleet
to be ready

55:21.530 --> 55:23.156
if the Soviets launch, all right?

55:23.907 --> 55:26.451
Mr. President, we may
have to do something forceful.

55:26.535 --> 55:27.536
Yes.

55:27.619 --> 55:30.497
Mr. President, sir. Take a look at the TV.

55:35.169 --> 55:37.671
-Ma'am.
-Thank you.

55:41.925 --> 55:42.926
This is Ellen Wilson.

55:43.010 --> 55:46.138
This is the White House operator.
Please hold for the president.

55:49.266 --> 55:50.267
Ellen.

55:50.350 --> 55:51.852
Mr. President.

55:51.935 --> 55:54.229
This Apollo-Soyuz business…

55:54.313 --> 55:58.400
Sir, I know we had discussed
canceling the mission, but I felt--

55:58.483 --> 56:02.571
It was beautiful.
And Nancy thought so too.

56:05.282 --> 56:08.493
Four patriots of different nations
coming together.

56:09.244 --> 56:12.372
Well, it was just inspirational.

56:13.498 --> 56:16.585
-We need that now more than ever, sir.
-Yes. Yes, we do.

56:16.668 --> 56:19.755
Now, there might be a way out of this yet,
if we have enough time.

56:19.838 --> 56:22.591
What's the status of Pathfinder and Buran?

56:22.674 --> 56:25.219
They're still out
of communication range, sir.

56:28.472 --> 56:31.141
You have two minutes
to comply with blockade.

56:31.225 --> 56:33.977
The United States
does not recognize your blockade.

56:34.061 --> 56:37.856
If you take any aggressive action,
we will respond in kind.

56:39.316 --> 56:42.152
Buran's radar signature
shows no sign of missile lock, sir.

56:43.111 --> 56:44.530
Maybe they are bluffing.

56:44.613 --> 56:46.031
No, they're just biding their time.

56:46.114 --> 56:48.033
Activate radar lock system.

56:53.580 --> 56:54.915
I have target acquisition.

56:54.998 --> 56:57.459
Confirmed.
Target range shows 180 kilometers,

56:57.543 --> 56:59.461
relative velocity two meters per second.

56:59.545 --> 57:01.380
Within targeting parameters.

57:01.463 --> 57:03.590
Once Buran engages
its missile lock system,

57:03.674 --> 57:07.511
there will only be seconds until they
fire on Sea Dragon, so we gotta be ready.

57:08.345 --> 57:10.389
Ride, lock weapons system on target.

57:18.313 --> 57:20.858
-Ride, lock weapons system on target.
-Admiral…

57:23.986 --> 57:27.364
Ed, this can't be the only way.

57:27.447 --> 57:29.283
-We can--
-We can what?

57:29.366 --> 57:31.618
Ask them nicely to leave us alone?

57:33.579 --> 57:35.455
You heard the general.

57:35.539 --> 57:37.124
They attacked Jamestown.

57:37.207 --> 57:39.501
They killed Americans.
We have orders to protect--

57:39.585 --> 57:42.254
Yes, but you are the commander
of this ship.

57:42.838 --> 57:45.132
The ultimate decision is yours.

57:45.215 --> 57:48.177
Ed, I watched you testify on Apollo 10.

57:48.886 --> 57:52.514
You sat there in front of the world,
and you said that that was your call.

57:52.598 --> 57:55.684
That's right, and I don't intend
on losing the moon a second time.

57:56.643 --> 57:58.645
The only thing
these people understand is strength.

57:58.729 --> 58:00.189
I saw it in Korea.

58:00.272 --> 58:02.149
If we didn't stand our ground
and fight back,

58:02.232 --> 58:04.276
the enemy would've gone
all the way to the South Sea.

58:04.359 --> 58:07.029
-Ed, this isn't Korea!
-You're goddamn right it isn't!

58:07.112 --> 58:10.949
It's a lot bigger.
Now lock weapons system on target!

58:16.038 --> 58:17.080
Cover my station.

58:24.880 --> 58:25.923
Step aside.

58:26.507 --> 58:28.091
You're relieved of duty.

58:29.218 --> 58:30.636
That's an order.

58:48.654 --> 58:49.947
System lock.

58:50.739 --> 58:52.699
Step away from the console, sir.

58:55.786 --> 58:57.496
Sally, what the hell are you doing?

58:57.579 --> 58:59.790
I said step away from the console.

59:02.459 --> 59:05.087
-Put the gun down, Sal.
-I'm not kidding, Ed.

59:05.921 --> 59:07.631
The Soviets attacked Jamestown.

59:08.257 --> 59:10.676
They got American blood on their hands,
and Sea Dragon--

59:10.759 --> 59:14.346
Is unmanned! And whatever its cargo,
that's not the same as a human life.

59:15.180 --> 59:17.057
We fire on Buran,
we kill everyone on board

59:17.140 --> 59:19.434
and probably start a war
that kills millions more.

59:19.518 --> 59:22.020
-That's not your call to make.
-Sally, put the gun down.

59:23.438 --> 59:26.316
Stay back, Ed. I mean it.

59:29.736 --> 59:31.238
You gonna shoot me, Sal?

59:33.782 --> 59:34.950
I'll do what I have to.

59:35.951 --> 59:37.202
So shoot me.

59:40.122 --> 59:42.165
Never shot anyone before, have you, Sal?

59:45.669 --> 59:48.255
Jesus! You both know
we're in a pressurized spacecraft, right?

59:48.839 --> 59:50.549
Sally's not gonna shoot anyone.
Are you, Sally?

59:55.512 --> 59:56.513
Enough.

59:57.890 --> 1:00:00.184
Enough! This is insane.

1:00:01.310 --> 1:00:03.854
You're both so goddamn sure
you're right, and maybe you are.

1:00:05.355 --> 1:00:07.065
We can't let them
shoot down the Sea Dragon,

1:00:07.149 --> 1:00:09.818
but we can't shoot down Buran either.

1:00:09.902 --> 1:00:12.404
Maybe it's not some
black-and-white choice. Right?

1:00:12.487 --> 1:00:14.072
Maybe there's some other way.

1:00:20.037 --> 1:00:21.997
Buran has missile lock on Sea Dragon.

1:00:26.210 --> 1:00:27.711
Ed, stop.

1:00:27.794 --> 1:00:30.172
Don't. Ed, please.

1:00:31.924 --> 1:00:33.008
Ed, stop.

1:00:36.094 --> 1:00:40.349
I'm gonna do what I gotta do, Sal.
You do what you have to.

1:00:41.058 --> 1:00:42.184
Please, Ed.

1:00:49.816 --> 1:00:51.360
Wait. Wait, that's not right.

1:00:53.237 --> 1:00:54.446
Yeah, it is.

1:01:49.751 --> 1:01:52.337
Pathfinder, this is Houston. Do you read?

1:01:54.214 --> 1:01:55.591
Pathfinder, Houston.

1:01:57.176 --> 1:02:00.929
Houston, this is Pathfinder.
It's good to hear your voice.

1:02:04.391 --> 1:02:07.936
Houston, I don't know
quite how to say this, but--

1:02:08.020 --> 1:02:10.731
Ed, it's Ellen. We need to know,
did you engage with Buran?

1:02:10.814 --> 1:02:12.274
Did you shoot them down?

1:02:13.442 --> 1:02:14.776
Negative.

1:02:17.154 --> 1:02:18.280
Thank God.

1:02:19.823 --> 1:02:20.824
Come again, Houston?

1:02:22.242 --> 1:02:25.245
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have breaking news.

1:02:25.329 --> 1:02:26.747
Reports have just come in

1:02:26.830 --> 1:02:30.292
that President Reagan has
rerouted Air Force One to Moscow

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:33.921
after making a last-minute entreaty
to Premier Andropov.

1:02:34.004 --> 1:02:36.298
-The two leaders hope to negotiate…
-Hold your fire!

1:02:36.381 --> 1:02:38.967
-We are being ordered to pull back!
-…a mutual pullback of forces

1:02:39.051 --> 1:02:42.054
both here and in space,
ending the current standoff.

1:02:42.137 --> 1:02:45.349
Sources at the White House conveyed
that President Reagan,

1:02:45.432 --> 1:02:47.142
like millions around the world,

1:02:47.226 --> 1:02:50.687
was so moved by the images
of the Apollo-Soyuz mission

1:02:50.771 --> 1:02:54.399
that it inspired him
to reach out his own hand in peace.

1:02:54.483 --> 1:02:57.611
Andropov's surprising
willingness to negotiate

1:02:57.694 --> 1:03:02.366
is thought in part to be linked to the
explosion of NASA's Sea Dragon 17 rocket,

1:03:02.449 --> 1:03:04.618
which is being blamed on faulty circuitry.

1:03:04.701 --> 1:03:07.037
NASA has not yet commented
on the incident.

1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:10.082
The Sea Dragon has had a perfect
safety record to this point,

1:03:10.165 --> 1:03:13.377
but production of the large rocket
has been halted at its Huntsville plant

1:03:13.460 --> 1:03:14.711
until further investigation.

1:05:19.670 --> 1:05:22.422
A grateful nation opens her heart today

1:05:22.506 --> 1:05:24.883
in gratitude for their sacrifice,

1:05:24.967 --> 1:05:28.178
for their courage
and for their noble service.

1:08:00.247 --> 1:08:02.791
On April 3rd, 1972,

1:08:02.875 --> 1:08:08.630
a C-5A Galaxy transport plane with 243
infants, children, volunteers and crew

1:08:08.714 --> 1:08:11.758
took off from Saigon
as part of Operation Babylift.

1:08:12.426 --> 1:08:16.596
One minute, 23 seconds later,
the plane crashed into a field.

1:08:17.639 --> 1:08:21.643
Forty-seven children were rescued.
I was one of them.

1:08:24.854 --> 1:08:26.939
There are these moments
that shape your life,

1:08:27.024 --> 1:08:29.359
moments you have no control over.

1:08:29.859 --> 1:08:32.571
If the pilot had banked left
instead of right,

1:08:33.154 --> 1:08:35.448
if the south had won the war in Vietnam,

1:08:36.073 --> 1:08:38.410
if the Russians
hadn't beat us to the moon…

1:08:39.828 --> 1:08:40.996
You okay?

1:08:45.292 --> 1:08:46.292
Yeah.

1:08:46.376 --> 1:08:48.754
I always thought things
happen for a reason.

1:08:48.837 --> 1:08:53.008
Good and bad, there's a design, a plan.

1:08:53.884 --> 1:08:55.469
But lately I've started to wonder

1:08:55.551 --> 1:08:58.095
if maybe we just say that
to make ourselves feel better.

1:08:59.055 --> 1:09:01.433
Maybe we're just drifting
from moment to moment

1:09:02.059 --> 1:09:03.977
trying to do what we think is right.

1:09:04.978 --> 1:09:06.897
To give some meaning to our lives.

1:09:08.857 --> 1:09:10.108
So who am I?

1:09:11.318 --> 1:09:16.532
I'm Hanh Nguyen, born in Saigon,
daughter of Le and Binh Nguyen.

1:09:17.533 --> 1:09:21.161
And I'm Kelly Ann Baldwin,
raised in Houston,

1:09:21.245 --> 1:09:23.412
daughter of Karen and Ed Baldwin.

1:09:24.747 --> 1:09:26.917
A child of the space program.

1:09:29.127 --> 1:09:31.546
Is this the journey I was meant to be on?

1:09:32.339 --> 1:09:37.051
Applying to the Naval Academy,
following in my father's footsteps?

1:09:38.428 --> 1:09:40.055
I don't know.

1:09:52.568 --> 1:09:56.572
All I know is the more we look back,
wondering what might have been,

1:09:56.655 --> 1:09:58.323
the less we're living for today.

1:09:59.950 --> 1:10:01.368
And the future…

1:10:02.327 --> 1:10:04.496
John Lennon probably put it best:

1:10:05.497 --> 1:10:07.457
"Everything will be okay in the end.

1:10:08.667 --> 1:10:12.004
And if it's not okay, it's not the end."

1:10:31.440 --> 1:10:32.774
Hello?

1:10:32.858 --> 1:10:35.235
Hello. Margo?

1:10:36.278 --> 1:10:37.279
Sergei?

1:10:37.863 --> 1:10:40.616
I wished to call to convey my respects.

1:10:41.992 --> 1:10:46.121
I wanted to be there myself today, but,
alas, I could not get the clearance.

1:10:46.205 --> 1:10:49.124
I'm sure that would have been complicated.

1:10:49.875 --> 1:10:53.253
They were heroes for America
and for the Soviet Union

1:10:53.337 --> 1:10:54.755
and for the whole world.

1:10:54.838 --> 1:10:56.006
Yes, they were.

1:10:57.341 --> 1:10:58.800
Margo, I wanted to ask,

1:10:58.884 --> 1:11:02.638
will you be at the ICSE conference
in the UK this summer?

1:11:03.680 --> 1:11:06.725
I'm not sure. Why?

1:11:06.808 --> 1:11:10.771
Well, I will be there. So, if you come,

1:11:10.854 --> 1:11:12.981
perhaps we could meet for a drink?

1:11:20.447 --> 1:11:22.241
-Margo?
-Yes.

1:11:24.535 --> 1:11:25.702
I'll have to see.

1:11:26.912 --> 1:11:29.373
If I'm going, I mean.

1:11:29.456 --> 1:11:32.793
There's a lot happening around Houston
around that time and…

1:11:33.377 --> 1:11:35.295
Yes. Yes, of course, I understand.

1:11:40.717 --> 1:11:42.427
But I'll see what I can do.

1:11:43.011 --> 1:11:44.137
Okay.

1:11:45.264 --> 1:11:47.015
I'll speak to you soon, Sergei.

1:11:48.517 --> 1:11:49.810
Goodbye, Margo.

1:12:12.207 --> 1:12:13.792
Good.

1:12:13.876 --> 1:12:14.918
Very good.

1:12:15.586 --> 1:12:17.880
I'm telling you, she will not come.

1:12:17.963 --> 1:12:18.964
It doesn't matter.

1:12:20.382 --> 1:12:23.260
She already opened the door with Buran.

1:12:24.094 --> 1:12:26.471
By the time she realizes
she is working for us,

1:12:27.347 --> 1:12:28.724
it will be too late.
