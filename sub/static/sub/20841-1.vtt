00:51.919 --> 00:54.823
<i>You never forget your first love.</i>

00:54.888 --> 00:56.825
<i>You carry it with you always.</i>

00:56.890 --> 01:01.196
<i>The right song instantly
takes you back to that time.</i>

01:01.261 --> 01:03.764
<i>For me, it was the summer of '63.</i>

01:03.831 --> 01:06.468
<i>Jackie Kennedy was still queen of Camelot</i>

01:06.533 --> 01:09.705
<i>and I was still known to my family as "Baby."</i>

01:09.770 --> 01:12.341
<i>The Feminine Mystique.</i> What does that mean?

01:12.406 --> 01:15.711
It's about how women's magazines
portray housewives as happy

01:15.776 --> 01:19.481
and career girls as unhappy,
when it's usually the opposite.

01:19.546 --> 01:21.450
I have to throw out my magazines?

01:21.515 --> 01:23.352
<i>My older sister Lisa,</i>

01:23.417 --> 01:26.355
<i>a college girl majoring in finding a husband.</i>

01:26.420 --> 01:30.492
"Bedroom Blues After the 10th Year
of Marriage," is that their agenda?

01:30.557 --> 01:34.196
All those articles are about sex
and beauty and fashion,

01:34.261 --> 01:36.398
- as if that's all women care about.
- Girls, please,

01:36.463 --> 01:39.134
your father hasn't taken a vacation in years.

01:39.199 --> 01:41.470
And look what you did...
you brought the bad weather.

01:41.535 --> 01:45.174
So can we please just stop fighting
so we can get some sunshine?

01:45.239 --> 01:47.376
<i># Oh, I said #</i>

01:47.441 --> 01:49.678
<i># They don't cry #</i>

01:49.743 --> 01:52.681
<i>My mom, the quintessential happy housewife.</i>

01:52.746 --> 01:54.049
<i># Cry-yi-yi #</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:56.218
<i># My, oh, my #</i>

01:56.283 --> 01:59.521
<i>My dad, my hero and my role model.</i>

01:59.586 --> 02:00.587
<i>I wanted to be just like him.</i>

02:00.654 --> 02:02.357
<i># I wonder why #</i>

02:02.422 --> 02:06.028
- <i># Silly boy #</i>
- <i># Told my girl we had to break up #</i>

02:06.093 --> 02:08.197
<i># Silly boy #</i>

02:08.262 --> 02:10.699
<i>But that was before
our summer at Kellerman's.</i>

02:10.764 --> 02:14.234
<i>The summer I stopped being the baby for good.</i>

02:14.301 --> 02:17.612
<i># Big girls don't cry #</i>

02:33.253 --> 02:36.225
For seniors, we have water polo
in the middle pool.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.826
And for kiddies,

02:37.891 --> 02:41.597
popsicles... orange, lemon, lime...

02:41.662 --> 02:43.699
all in the main lodge.

02:43.764 --> 02:48.670
And at 1:30, boats are on the lake.
Learn to row, work those arms.

02:48.735 --> 02:53.108
And at 5:00, dinner is served.
We have meatloaf.

02:53.173 --> 02:57.312
Jake! The prodigal son has returned.

02:57.377 --> 02:59.481
- Max.
- What's it been... five years?

02:59.546 --> 03:02.885
Ten. Jake has been so busy with work.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.454
Well, even a world-famous heart surgeon
deserves a rest.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.924
- No doubt.
- You're prettier than ever.

03:08.989 --> 03:11.094
Oh, Max!

03:12.159 --> 03:14.296
And is this the baby?

03:14.361 --> 03:15.797
She's practically a woman.

03:15.862 --> 03:19.901
Baby's going to Mount Holyoke
in the fall. She's the smart one.

03:19.967 --> 03:24.006
My grandson Neil is at the Cornell School
of Hotel Management.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.541
Maybe we should get you two kids together.

03:27.074 --> 03:28.109
- Billy!
- Yes, sir.

03:28.175 --> 03:30.155
Get Dr. Houseman's bags.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.017
- Remember Lisa?
- Yes, of course.

03:35.082 --> 03:36.952
What, are you smuggling gold bricks in here?

03:37.017 --> 03:40.789
- Uh, books mostly. I read a lot.
- You're one of those smart girls.

03:40.854 --> 03:44.159
Smart? She's gonna cure cancer.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.296
- Who knows how to merengue?
- Come on.

03:47.361 --> 03:51.669
- One, two, three, four, and shimmy.
- Seven, eight.

03:53.734 --> 03:56.138
It's a two-four rhythm, folks.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.807
Two, one, two, three, four.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.043
One, two, three, four.

04:01.108 --> 04:02.945
One, two, three, four.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.214
- One, two, three, four.
- Yeah.

04:05.279 --> 04:08.021
Marco. Help me demonstrate.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.521
One, two, three, four.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.225
One, two, and shimmy.

04:17.824 --> 04:19.560
Looks like you've got an admirer.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.898
- Who?
- The piano player.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.067
Get real, Baby.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.669
Why not? He's cute.

04:27.734 --> 04:30.072
So are puppies, but I'm not gonna date one.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.074
Seven, eight, shimmy around the world.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.483
Let me see those coconuts.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.617
...three, one, don't forget to smile!

04:41.682 --> 04:43.787
All right, everybody, now grab a partner.

04:46.019 --> 04:47.521
- Dad?
- No.

04:47.587 --> 04:51.660
Dad, come on. It'll make Mom happy. Come on.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.037
You know, the first time we danced,
you were dancing on my feet.

05:02.102 --> 05:05.374
I just can't believe
you're going off to college.

05:05.439 --> 05:08.310
Dad, I'll only be a few hours away.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.548
You can visit me anytime.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.551
I'm sorry, Dad. Sorry.

05:16.616 --> 05:18.823
See? You're still dancing on my feet.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.030
- You a college man?
- Yes, sir.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.698
I just graduated from Georgetown.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.600
I'm starting Harvard Medical
School in the fall.

05:31.665 --> 05:34.770
Harvard? Never heard of it.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.840
My husband was a waiter here the summer
before he started medical school.

05:38.905 --> 05:40.542
That's how we met.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.945
You're a very lucky man, Dr. Houseman,
to have such a beautiful family.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.747
I hope to be that lucky.

05:45.812 --> 05:49.817
Robbie, the Housemans
are very dear friends of mine.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.454
Whatever they need, you make it happen.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.156
Yes, sir.

05:54.221 --> 05:58.660
I wanted Baby to meet my grandson, Neil.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.495
I hear you're going to Mount Holyoke.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.964
Single-sex education
is superior in my opinion.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.966
- Hmm.
- Baby's reading a book you might like...

06:05.031 --> 06:06.201
<i>The Feminine Mystique?</i>

06:06.266 --> 06:07.768
I read it, cover to cover.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.940
Betty Friedan is a revolutionary thinker.
I'd love to hear your thoughts.

06:12.272 --> 06:15.544
You know we have ballroom dancing
after dinner. Care to join me?

06:15.609 --> 06:17.512
Sure, Neil, that sounds great.

06:17.577 --> 06:19.948
I do a pretty mean foxtrot.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.050
See you out there, Doc.

06:34.728 --> 06:37.966
So, Baby, you gonna be a doctor?

06:38.031 --> 06:39.901
Hopefully a surgeon, like my dad.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.105
That's fantastic. A woman can be
anything she wants to be.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.208
- I truly believe that.
- Thanks, Neil.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.952
Good evening, one and all.

06:57.017 --> 07:01.423
I want to thank our band leader
of 20 years, Tito Suarez.

07:01.488 --> 07:03.195
Tito.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.630
Tito, my friend, can you believe

07:08.695 --> 07:11.232
there's only three weeks left
of our summer season?

07:11.298 --> 07:12.467
Oh, no, Mr. Kellerman.

07:12.532 --> 07:15.937
We've been having way too much fun
for it to be all over.

07:16.002 --> 07:19.541
Tell them about our summer-ending
talent show.

07:19.606 --> 07:24.646
Well, whoever you are, whatever gift
you have in life, come.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.089
Share it with us.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.752
And speaking of talent,

07:30.817 --> 07:33.422
please welcome our very own dance team...

07:33.487 --> 07:35.626
Penny and Johnny!

08:14.027 --> 08:16.298
- They're really good.
- I guess they're okay,

08:16.363 --> 08:18.733
but Johnny's got a real attitude problem.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.435
The guests love him.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.003
I mean, <i>I</i> can dance like that.

08:37.884 --> 08:39.488
Whoo!

09:20.327 --> 09:23.198
- Hey, Baby.
- Oh. Yeah?

09:23.263 --> 09:26.701
I've been practicing my dancing.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.870
I could use a few pointers.

09:28.935 --> 09:32.340
Tonight, in my room?

09:32.405 --> 09:34.376
I'll be there.

09:34.441 --> 09:39.914
Maybe... we should sneak back to the room
while the girls are occupied.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.884
Hey, uh, I'm kind of tired.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.520
I think I'm just gonna go back and read.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.988
What about Neil?

09:47.053 --> 09:50.025
We're madly in love.
We're going to elope tomorrow.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.994
You know you can't spend the whole
summer with your nose in books, sweetie.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.368
Why not?

09:55.362 --> 09:56.500
Mm-hmm.

09:59.332 --> 10:02.938
Hey, Baby, wait up.
I'll walk you to your cabin.

10:03.003 --> 10:04.739
You sometimes see garter snakes around here.

10:04.804 --> 10:06.007
I like snakes.

10:06.072 --> 10:08.443
What about bears? We had one last summer.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.745
Good night, Neil.

10:10.810 --> 10:12.480
Thank you for the dance. See you tomorrow.

10:12.545 --> 10:14.115
Good night.

10:28.928 --> 10:30.065
Hey, Billy, right?

10:30.130 --> 10:33.301
Hey, smart girl! You lost?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.570
No, I'm just taking a walk.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.839
What's up there?

10:37.904 --> 10:39.307
This territory's for staff only.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.809
- Whoa.
- Here, let me help you.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.744
I'm good. I'm good.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.812
Oof... okay.

10:44.878 --> 10:46.481
Don't tell anybody you were here.

10:46.546 --> 10:49.755
Come on. Let's go.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.859
<i># I'm a love man #</i>

10:58.925 --> 11:01.296
<i># Call me the love man #</i>

11:01.361 --> 11:04.566
<i># Oh, baby, I'm a love man #</i>

11:04.631 --> 11:07.840
<i># That's what they call me, I'm a love man #</i>

11:09.102 --> 11:12.307
<i># I'm 6'1", weigh 210 #</i>

11:12.372 --> 11:15.343
<i># The long hair and pretty fair skin #</i>

11:15.408 --> 11:18.513
<i># I'm long-legged and I'm out of sight #</i>

11:18.578 --> 11:21.582
<i># My, my babe, I'm gonna take you out #</i>

11:21.648 --> 11:23.785
<i># 'Cause I'm a love man #</i>

11:23.850 --> 11:26.655
<i># Ooh, baby, I'm a love man #</i>

11:26.720 --> 11:28.323
<i># Take your hand, let me holler one time #</i>

11:28.388 --> 11:29.791
<i># Ow! #</i>

11:32.926 --> 11:34.428
<i># Whoooo! #</i>

11:35.662 --> 11:38.066
<i># Love man, that's all I am now #</i>

11:38.131 --> 11:41.503
Hey! You gonna carry that watermelon
all night? Come on.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.405
<i># They call me the love man #</i>

11:43.470 --> 11:46.508
<i># Yes, I am, I'm just a love man #</i>

11:46.573 --> 11:48.243
<i># Let me tell you something #</i>

11:48.308 --> 11:51.046
<i># Which one of you girls
want me to hold you? #</i>

11:51.111 --> 11:54.182
<i># Which one of you girls
want me to kiss you? #</i>

11:54.247 --> 11:56.885
<i># Which one of you girls
want me to take you out? #</i>

11:56.950 --> 11:59.487
<i># Go on, I got you,
gonna knock you all night #</i>

11:59.552 --> 12:01.456
<i># 'Cause, baby, I'm a love man #</i>

12:01.521 --> 12:03.124
<i># All right #</i>

12:03.189 --> 12:06.061
<i># Ooh, baby, I'm a love man, let me tell ya #</i>

12:06.126 --> 12:08.496
<i># I'm sayin' I'm just a love man #</i>

12:08.561 --> 12:11.800
<i># Good ol' man, I'm just a love man #</i>

12:18.037 --> 12:21.676
<i># Good ol' man, I'm just a love man #</i>

12:27.447 --> 12:28.551
Johnny!

12:31.484 --> 12:35.956
<i># You broke my heart
'cause I couldn't dance #</i>

12:36.022 --> 12:39.194
<i># You didn't even want me around #</i>

12:39.259 --> 12:42.697
<i># And now I'm back to let you know #</i>

12:42.762 --> 12:44.799
<i># I can really shake 'em down #</i>

12:46.533 --> 12:48.203
<i># Do you love me? #</i>

12:48.268 --> 12:49.770
<i># I can really move #</i>

12:49.836 --> 12:51.272
<i># Do you love me? #</i>

12:51.337 --> 12:52.741
<i># I'm in the groove #</i>

12:52.806 --> 12:54.576
<i># Now, do you love me? #</i>

12:54.641 --> 12:56.411
<i># Do you love me? #</i>

12:56.476 --> 13:01.049

<i># Work, work #</i>

13:10.256 --> 13:11.926
<i># Well, you drive me crazy #</i>

13:11.991 --> 13:13.394
<i># Work, work #</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:15.363
<i># Just a little bit of soul now #</i>

13:15.428 --> 13:16.566
<i># Work #</i>

13:18.164 --> 13:19.534

13:19.599 --> 13:21.202

13:21.267 --> 13:23.104
<i># I can do the twist #</i>

13:23.169 --> 13:24.439
<i># I can do the twist #</i>

13:24.504 --> 13:26.374
<i># Now tell me, baby #</i>

13:26.439 --> 13:27.609
<i># Tell me, baby #</i>

13:27.674 --> 13:29.244
<i># Do you like it like this? #</i>

13:29.309 --> 13:30.879
<i># Do you like it like this? #</i>

13:30.944 --> 13:32.180
<i># Tell me #</i>

13:32.245 --> 13:34.282
<i># Tell me #</i>

13:34.347 --> 13:36.584
<i># Tell me #</i>

13:36.649 --> 13:38.856

13:40.553 --> 13:42.524
<i># Yow! #</i>

14:12.752 --> 14:14.589
<i># Oh! #</i>

14:14.654 --> 14:18.193
That's my cousin Johnny.
He got me the job here.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.296
- Is that his girlfriend?
- Penny? No.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.204
That's just his dance partner.

14:25.231 --> 14:26.835
What's she doing here, Billy?

14:28.668 --> 14:30.272
I carried his watermelon.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.639
What's your name?

14:33.806 --> 14:36.343
- Baby.
- Do me a favor, Baby.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.279
Carry your own watermelon next time.

14:38.344 --> 14:40.586
The bunkhouse is staff only.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.061
<i># Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, come on! #</i>

14:53.126 --> 14:54.262
<i># Work, work #</i>

14:54.327 --> 14:56.464
<i># Oh, shake it up, shake it #</i>

14:56.529 --> 14:57.530
<i># Work, work #</i>

14:57.597 --> 14:59.600
<i># Oh, shake 'em, shake 'em down #</i>

14:59.666 --> 15:00.735
<i># Work, work #</i>

15:00.800 --> 15:02.803
<i># Oh, little bit of soul now #</i>

15:02.869 --> 15:04.041
<i># Work #</i>

15:05.672 --> 15:07.174
<i># Work, work #</i>

15:07.240 --> 15:08.943
<i># Ah, just a bit, baby #</i>

15:09.008 --> 15:10.111
<i># Work, work #</i>

15:10.176 --> 15:12.213
<i># Oh, you're driving me crazy #</i>

15:12.278 --> 15:13.348
<i># Work, work #</i>

15:13.413 --> 15:15.450
<i># Ah, don't get lazy #</i>

15:15.515 --> 15:16.858
<i># Work #</i>

15:18.151 --> 15:19.754
<i># Do you love me? #</i>

15:19.819 --> 15:21.289
<i># Do you love me? #</i>

15:21.354 --> 15:22.856
<i># Ah, do you love me? #</i>

15:22.922 --> 15:24.525
<i># Oh, do you love me? #</i>

15:24.590 --> 15:26.327
<i># Do you love me?#</i>

15:26.392 --> 15:28.229
<i># Do you love me? #</i>

15:28.294 --> 15:32.634
<i># Now that I can dance #</i>

15:32.699 --> 15:36.271
- <i># Dance #</i>
- <i># Oh, yeah #</i>

15:36.336 --> 15:37.572
- <i># Watch me now #</i>
- <i># Hey! #</i>

15:37.637 --> 15:38.773
<i># Work, work #</i>

15:38.838 --> 15:40.642
<i># Oh, work it out, baby #</i>

15:40.707 --> 15:41.876
<i># Work, work #</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:43.778
<i># Well, you're driving me crazy #</i>

15:43.843 --> 15:44.844
<i># Work, work #</i>

15:44.911 --> 15:47.187
<i># Ah, don't you get lazy #</i>

15:48.681 --> 15:49.851
<i># Come on, baby #</i>

15:49.916 --> 15:53.187
<i># Yow! #</i>

15:53.252 --> 15:55.556
<i># Do you love me? #</i>

15:55.621 --> 15:57.825
<i># Yeah. #</i>

16:05.531 --> 16:08.936
Better change your name, kid,
'cause you're not a baby anymore.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.642
What's wrong with you?

17:21.707 --> 17:25.046
Nothing. Just not hungry.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.180
Well, you need to eat.

17:26.244 --> 17:29.852
- Tonight's our longest shift.
- Thanks, Dad.

17:31.417 --> 17:32.987
Hey, Penny!

17:33.052 --> 17:37.057
I heard you give private lessons. How much?

17:37.123 --> 17:40.028
Forget it, college boy. You can't afford it.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.497
Really? I hear she doesn't charge much.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.133
- What'd you say?
- He just wants to rile you up.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.934
- Don't let him.
- You're a real tough guy, Johnny.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.774
- So why am I not impressed?
- Hey!

17:50.103 --> 17:51.639
Mr. Kellerman.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.975
- Is there a problem here?
- No, sir.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.309
No problem on my end.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.678
Grandfather, I told you. He has
a real attitude problem.

17:57.743 --> 18:01.649
Mr. Castle, if I want Marlon Brando,
I'll call Hollywood.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.184
How long have you worked here?

18:03.249 --> 18:04.585
Six years, sir.

18:04.650 --> 18:08.022
So it's not possible that you don't know
where the staff entrance is.

18:08.087 --> 18:09.457
Yeah, I know where it is.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.726
He had another private lesson
with Mrs. Pressman.

18:11.791 --> 18:13.430
Shut your mouth.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.898
This is a family destination.

18:16.963 --> 18:20.934
If I hear about you giving the guests
anything but dance lessons,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.870
you're out on your <i>keister.</i>

18:22.935 --> 18:24.839
Really? Is that the company policy?

18:24.904 --> 18:27.275
'Cause I get the feeling the rules are
different for some of us.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.111
That's right. This isn't the United Nations.

18:30.176 --> 18:32.914
Those boys are all Ivy Leaguers.

18:32.979 --> 18:36.449
Any father here would be thrilled
to see his daughter with any of them.

18:36.516 --> 18:39.220
Yeah, they seem like real sweethearts.

18:39.285 --> 18:42.356
I have dozens of résumés for other dancers,

18:42.421 --> 18:44.258
some of whom dance on Broadway.

18:44.323 --> 18:46.527
If you can't get along with my staff,

18:46.592 --> 18:49.363
say the word and I'll call them tomorrow.

18:49.428 --> 18:52.567
We won't be any trouble, Mr. Kellerman.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.077
Right, Johnny?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.340
Right.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.716
Good job, sir.

19:06.579 --> 19:09.458
Johnny, just ignore him.

19:11.317 --> 19:16.891
I signed us up for a putting
competition tomorrow. You game?

19:16.956 --> 19:19.093
Sure.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.462
What else am I gonna do all day?

19:21.527 --> 19:23.865
You're such a perfectionist.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.308
I wonder who I got that from.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.939
You wanna be a doctor, don't you?
You're not doing it for me, right?

19:32.004 --> 19:36.144
I mean, of course, it's not pure
coincidence that I chose medicine.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.278
As long as you chose,

19:37.343 --> 19:41.182
'cause I don't remember ever
making a choice to be a doctor.

19:41.247 --> 19:45.153
My father made it clear it was expected
from the time I was six years old.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.455
I'd just hate for you to feel that way.

20:14.113 --> 20:17.686
- A special going on today.
- Thank you.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.223
Try one on.

20:24.290 --> 20:25.493
- Me?
- Yeah.

20:25.558 --> 20:29.263
- No, I'm not really into wigs.
- You'd make a great Marilyn.

20:29.328 --> 20:31.899
Come on. It's fun to be someone else.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.772
Okay.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.175
Mm.

20:40.072 --> 20:42.882
- You're a wonderful dancer.
- Thank you.

20:44.443 --> 20:47.982
It must be incredible
to do something so well.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.486
Your parents must be really proud of you.

20:52.551 --> 20:56.424
I don't know. We haven't spoken
in a few years, so...

20:56.489 --> 20:58.159
What's your name?

20:58.224 --> 20:59.927
- Frances.
- Thank you.

20:59.992 --> 21:02.029
But everyone calls me Baby.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.095
Does that bother you?

21:04.163 --> 21:06.834
No. Not really.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.203
My sister couldn't say Frances
for the longest time,

21:09.268 --> 21:13.207
so she called me Baby. Kind of just stuck.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.943
Well, you don't look like a baby to me.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.815
It's only $16.99.
I can charge it to your account.

21:20.880 --> 21:21.881
- Hey, Penny.
- Yeah.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.117
Hey, kid.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.719
I just booked a private. Can you
cover my 2:00 p.m. mambo class?

21:25.785 --> 21:29.190
Sure, Johnny. Never a dull moment.

21:29.255 --> 21:32.600
Hey, Baby, you should buy that wig.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.487
What do you think of Argentina?

22:00.553 --> 22:03.457
Well, the government's a mess
since the last election.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.626
The guerrillas won't let the Peronistas
take their seats.

22:05.691 --> 22:08.162
- Why?
- Well, I was just thinking

22:08.227 --> 22:12.933
that we'd always talked about traveling
once the girls were out of the house.

22:12.998 --> 22:14.935
To Argentina?

22:15.000 --> 22:17.238
Okay, so forget Argentina.

22:17.303 --> 22:18.839
What about Paris?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.943
Remember our honeymoon?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.579
Walking down the Champs-Élysées,

22:25.644 --> 22:29.956
drinking <i>vin rose</i> at the bistro
next to the hotel.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.488
We can go to Paris if you want.

22:34.553 --> 22:37.358
I have to put a request in at the hospital.

22:37.423 --> 22:39.760
How about a year from next Christmas?

22:39.825 --> 22:41.429
We can bring the girls.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.402
That sounds wonderful.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.190
- Let me go.
- What's wrong?

23:03.783 --> 23:05.052
You're late.

23:05.117 --> 23:07.597
Are you ready? Let's go.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.195
Are you okay?

23:14.693 --> 23:17.398
Sorry, I was worried about you.

23:17.463 --> 23:19.333
Yeah. I'm fine.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.302
You're sick. Let me walk you home.

23:21.367 --> 23:23.070
No, no, I have to work.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.306
You can't work. You're sick.

23:25.371 --> 23:28.216
I'm not sick. I'm pregnant.

23:32.211 --> 23:34.714
Forget you ever heard that.

23:34.780 --> 23:36.282
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:36.348 --> 23:39.219
Miss Rhode Island, Vivian Pressman!

23:50.095 --> 23:53.734
<i># Never know how much I love you #</i>

23:53.799 --> 23:56.245
<i># Never know how much I care #</i>

23:57.503 --> 24:00.534

24:00.600 --> 24:03.010

24:03.075 --> 24:06.013

<i># Moon lights up the night #</i>

24:25.097 --> 24:28.803
<i># I light up when you call my name #</i>

24:28.868 --> 24:31.172
<i># And you know I'm gonna treat you right #</i>

24:31.237 --> 24:34.241
<i># You give me fever #</i>

24:41.447 --> 24:43.884
<i># In the morning,
a fever all through the night #</i>

24:43.949 --> 24:45.952
All right, this is vulgar. Let's go.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.655
You can go. I wanna stay.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.324
<i># Everybody's got the fever #</i>

24:50.389 --> 24:53.794
<i># That is something you all know #</i>

24:53.859 --> 24:57.231
<i># Fever isn't such a new thing #</i>

24:57.296 --> 25:00.573
<i># Fever started long ago #</i>

25:08.240 --> 25:10.911
<i># Romeo loved Juliet #</i>

25:10.976 --> 25:14.548
<i># Juliet, she felt the same #</i>

25:14.613 --> 25:17.418
<i># When he put his arms around her #</i>

25:17.483 --> 25:20.321
- <i># He said...</i>
- <i># Julie, baby, you're my flame #</i>

25:20.386 --> 25:23.299

<i># What a lovely way to burn #</i>

26:18.978 --> 26:24.621
<i># What a lovely way to burn. #</i>

26:31.557 --> 26:33.560
- Johnny?
- Hey, kid.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.629
I need you to come with me.

26:35.694 --> 26:39.073
It's about Penny. Come on.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.538
Hey, what's going on?

26:47.239 --> 26:49.913
I'm in trouble, Johnny.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.634
How...

27:07.326 --> 27:10.297
- Whose is it?
- Doesn't matter.

27:10.362 --> 27:13.534
Yeah, it matters. Whoever he is
needs to step up.

27:13.599 --> 27:17.206
Well, he won't. I already asked him.

27:21.373 --> 27:23.546
We'll figure it out.

27:24.877 --> 27:28.825
We need money... money we don't have.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.320
My cousin went.

27:33.385 --> 27:36.696
Guy charged her 250 bucks.

27:40.092 --> 27:42.429
Could you ask Mr. Kellerman for an advance?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.064
For this? Yeah, sure.

27:44.129 --> 27:46.300
He's just aching for a reason to fire us.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.337
Johnny, I'm scared.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.773
What if it starts to show?

27:52.838 --> 27:55.309
- I'll help you.
- This is none of your business.

27:55.374 --> 27:56.375
She's just trying to help.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.812
And thanks for coming to get me.
You did your good deed for the day.

27:58.877 --> 28:00.982
Now why don't you waltz on back
to the ballroom?

28:24.770 --> 28:26.340
Where are you going?

28:26.405 --> 28:28.942
Uh, nowhere. Go to sleep.

28:29.007 --> 28:31.378
Please tell me it's not to see our waiter.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.781
Come on, Baby, you're 18. Time to grow up.

28:33.846 --> 28:36.050
I just think there's more
to life than getting married.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.852
Why can't I just get married
without you judging me?

28:38.917 --> 28:41.555
Let's just accept the fact
that we have nothing in common.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.465
If we weren't sisters, we'd never be friends.

28:58.003 --> 29:00.140
Oh, thank you.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.481
You're so nice.

29:03.776 --> 29:08.885
A toast to the most beautiful girl
at Kellerman's.

29:11.250 --> 29:14.788
- Robbie.
- It's true.

29:14.853 --> 29:17.527
You're exactly the kind of girl
I dream about marrying someday.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.328
When is someday?

29:21.393 --> 29:23.831
I don't know. You tell me.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.536
What does that mean?

29:28.033 --> 29:29.103
Let me take this.

29:33.839 --> 29:36.510
I think...

29:36.575 --> 29:39.750
that you are incredible.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.549
You do?

29:44.249 --> 29:45.888
I do.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.663
How do you like hearing those words?

29:56.728 --> 29:57.898
- "I do"?
- Mm.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.701
Hmm. I do.

30:00.766 --> 30:03.372
I do. I do.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.050
- Robbie, wait.
- Why?

30:17.115 --> 30:18.552
Wait.

30:18.617 --> 30:21.054
- But we love each other.
- Robbie, stop.

30:21.119 --> 30:23.090
- Shh.
- No, stop. I'm...

30:23.155 --> 30:25.192
Wait, I... stop it.

30:25.257 --> 30:26.960
Robbie, stop it!

30:27.025 --> 30:28.527
- No, Robbie!
- Oh!

30:28.594 --> 30:30.574
I said no, you jerk!

30:32.397 --> 30:33.867
What are you gonna do? Cry to daddy?

30:33.932 --> 30:36.170
- Come on, Lisa. Come back.
- Don't you dare follow me!

30:36.235 --> 30:37.671
I'm gonna go to Mr. Kellerman and tell him!

30:37.736 --> 30:39.272
Tell him what?

30:39.338 --> 30:42.276
You came after me, remember?

30:42.341 --> 30:44.753
You brought the wine.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.984
Don't ever speak to me again.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.762
- Robbie, you play golf?
- Yes, sir.

31:01.827 --> 31:06.166
My father always said he made more deals
on the golf course than in the boardroom.

31:06.231 --> 31:07.935
You should come play golf with me.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.378
I'm sure Robbie has lots
of responsibilities in the kitchen.

31:11.970 --> 31:13.140
She's right, Dr. Houseman.

31:13.205 --> 31:16.414
I have to, uh, inventory the pantry today.

31:22.281 --> 31:25.419
Lisa, you don't have to be so rude.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.321
He's not gonna be a waiter forever, you know.

31:27.386 --> 31:28.622
Why do you people think

31:28.687 --> 31:31.291
that just because
a guy goes to Harvard or Yale

31:31.356 --> 31:32.526
that means he's perfect?

31:32.591 --> 31:34.828
I mean, maybe he's an axe murderer.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.064
Are you saying our waiter's an axe murderer?

31:37.129 --> 31:41.568
No. I... don't know, but he could be.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.370
We would never know.

31:43.435 --> 31:47.816
She's right, Jake. We would never know.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.018
What?

31:58.083 --> 31:59.553
What's the deal? You've been letting me win?

31:59.618 --> 32:02.322
No. Not at all.

32:02.387 --> 32:03.866
What's bugging you, honey?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.027
Can I borrow some money from you?

32:07.092 --> 32:10.497
It's for a friend... I can't tell you why.

32:10.562 --> 32:11.836
Is it something illegal?

32:14.032 --> 32:15.135
No.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.471
Well, how much do you need?

32:17.536 --> 32:19.243
$250.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.677
Wow.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.512
That's a lot of money.

32:25.577 --> 32:29.249
I'll pay you back, but it's for something
really important, Dad.

32:29.314 --> 32:31.685
I need you to trust me on this.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.696
I do trust you, Baby.

32:36.188 --> 32:38.191
Thanks, Daddy.

32:40.492 --> 32:42.995
<i># When I'm alone #</i>

32:44.663 --> 32:48.304
<i># With no one to love me #</i>

32:49.368 --> 32:52.306

34:01.106 --> 34:05.345
Hey, um, can I talk to you guys?

34:05.410 --> 34:07.014
In private.

34:07.079 --> 34:10.283
<i># Somebody #</i>

34:10.348 --> 34:14.621
<i># Somebody please love me #</i>

34:14.686 --> 34:17.657

34:17.722 --> 34:21.061
<i># Just a little... #</i>

34:21.126 --> 34:22.571
I have money for you.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.099
$250.

34:26.164 --> 34:28.301
It's all there.

34:28.366 --> 34:30.737
- You're kidding?
- Mm.

34:30.802 --> 34:32.706
We'll pay it back, Baby, every cent.

34:32.771 --> 34:34.908
No. We won't.

34:34.973 --> 34:36.376
You don't have to pay it back.

34:36.440 --> 34:38.011
That's even worse. We're not a charity case.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.014
Yes, we are, Johnny.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.251
It's not charity.

34:44.315 --> 34:47.254
I want to hire you.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.056
For dance lessons.

34:49.121 --> 34:50.998
For who?

34:54.326 --> 34:55.495
For me.

34:55.560 --> 34:58.031
Give me a break. That's way too much money.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.200
No, it isn't.

35:00.265 --> 35:03.769
I wanna dance
in the end of summer talent show.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.314
Why?

35:07.439 --> 35:11.678
Because it's good for the human
brain to learn new things.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.314
It keeps you from getting senile.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.285
Fine.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.687
But I don't take handouts.

35:20.752 --> 35:23.790
So I expect you to show up 9:00 a.m. sharp,

35:23.855 --> 35:26.460
in proper clothing,

35:26.525 --> 35:28.164
ready to work.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.371
I'll be there.

35:38.003 --> 35:40.807
<i># Please #</i>

35:40.872 --> 35:45.878
<i># Love me. #</i>

35:52.350 --> 35:54.821
- Okay, you ready?
- Mm.

35:54.886 --> 35:56.256
Six, seven, eight.

35:56.321 --> 35:59.392
One, <i>two</i>, three, four. <i>Two,</i> three, four.

35:59.457 --> 36:02.596
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

36:02.661 --> 36:04.598
You don't step on the one.
You gotta start on the two.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.567
<i>Two,</i> three, four.
Find the <i>two,</i> you understand?

36:07.632 --> 36:09.603
- <i>Two,</i> three...
- No.

36:09.668 --> 36:10.977
Can you count?

36:12.304 --> 36:15.509
One, <i>two</i>, three, four. One, <i>two,</i> three, four.

36:15.574 --> 36:20.780
One, <i>two,</i> three, four. Find it.
Listen. Watch me.

36:21.513 --> 36:24.551
Six, seven, eight. One, <i>two,</i> three, four.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.286
<i>Two,</i> three, four.

36:26.351 --> 36:30.090
<i>Two,</i> three, four. <i>Two</i>, three, four.

36:30.155 --> 36:31.691
To a dance position.

36:31.756 --> 36:34.161
Basic position. Two, three, four.

36:34.226 --> 36:37.297
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.432
Two, three. Bigger steps.

36:39.497 --> 36:41.768
Both of your toes... Two, three, four.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.971
Soft, but it's locked, okay?
Two, three, four.

36:45.036 --> 36:48.074
Two, three... Head up.

36:48.139 --> 36:50.911
Relax. Breathe.

36:50.976 --> 36:54.181
Frame. Look, spaghetti arms.

36:54.246 --> 36:57.350
This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.

36:57.415 --> 36:59.753
I don't go into yours,
you don't go into mine.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.388
You gotta hold the frame.

37:01.453 --> 37:03.023
Again.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.825
Two, three, four.
Let your whole body feel it.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.660
It's not just your feet.

37:08.025 --> 37:09.895
What was that?

37:10.660 --> 37:13.700
I'm ready. I was preparing.

37:13.765 --> 37:16.803
Two, three, four. Use your hips.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.039
Two, three, four. Don't touch your hips,
just use them.

37:19.104 --> 37:22.342
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.578
- Two, three, four.
- There we go.

37:24.643 --> 37:26.079
Two, three, four.

37:30.782 --> 37:32.452
Feel your partner. Two, three, four.

37:32.517 --> 37:33.587
It's gotta be off of them.

37:33.652 --> 37:34.721
There's nobody there.

37:34.786 --> 37:36.856
You have to imagine there's somebody there,

37:36.921 --> 37:39.092
just like you have to imagine
you have more rhythm.

37:39.157 --> 37:42.495
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

37:42.560 --> 37:43.663
Two, three, four.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.873
Look at my eyes. Hey.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.440
Not like that.

37:58.977 --> 38:01.355
- They're so large, I just...
- That's funny.

38:07.752 --> 38:09.823
There we go.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.060
Better. Two...

38:12.390 --> 38:15.132
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

38:28.106 --> 38:31.177
You look like my patients
at the V.A. hospital.

38:31.242 --> 38:32.778
What war have you been fighting?

38:34.212 --> 38:37.751
Oh, I just went for a really long hike.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.754
- By yourself?
- With Neil?

38:40.819 --> 38:43.657
No. By myself.

38:43.722 --> 38:47.761
We read Thoreau last year in English,
and it got me inspired.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.162
I signed us up for the tournament tomorrow.

38:49.227 --> 38:51.002
We have a 7:00 a.m. tee time.

38:54.366 --> 38:58.038
- You don't wanna do it?
- No, I do. I do.

38:58.103 --> 39:01.508
I just... I made plans.

39:01.573 --> 39:04.144
Neil is taking me out on a canoe.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.945
I'll do the tournament with you.

39:06.010 --> 39:10.083
I mean, I know I'm not as good
as Baby, but I'll do my best.

39:10.148 --> 39:12.552
- Greetings, Houseman family.
- Neil.

39:12.617 --> 39:15.655
I hear you stole my golf partner
to be your canoe date.

39:19.124 --> 39:21.861
Yes. I'm quite fond of canoeing,

39:21.926 --> 39:24.631
and we have new paddles in from Denmark.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.499
Would you like to see
those paddles now, Baby?

39:26.564 --> 39:29.269
Yes. I would. I would like to go see

39:29.334 --> 39:32.605
- those... paddles.
- Let's go see those paddles.

39:36.674 --> 39:41.448
So, um, are you taking
a canoe ride with someone else?

39:41.513 --> 39:44.460
What? No.

39:46.151 --> 39:48.358
No. Not at all.

39:50.622 --> 39:54.060
I'm taking dance lessons, and I just
don't want my family to know.

39:54.125 --> 39:59.598
Lisa's the one who likes dancing
and boys and lipstick.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.401
And I'm the other one...

40:01.466 --> 40:04.537
the one who likes books and art

40:04.602 --> 40:06.906
and dissecting fetal goats.

40:09.607 --> 40:10.977
Why can't you be both?

40:11.042 --> 40:15.047
You should be able to take
a merengue class or wear lipstick

40:15.113 --> 40:17.717
without it leading
to the end of Western civilization.

40:18.883 --> 40:21.386
Isn't that what <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>
is all about?

40:21.453 --> 40:24.628
That women shouldn't have to choose
between a career and a personal life?

40:29.127 --> 40:31.437
You're absolutely right, Neil.

40:43.775 --> 40:47.447
Good morning, ladies and gents
and children of all ages.

40:47.512 --> 40:49.515
If you think you're the next Henny Youngman,

40:49.581 --> 40:52.852
don't miss amateur comedy night
tonight in the polo lounge.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.088
You know, marriage is a three-ring process.

40:55.153 --> 40:56.890
You have the engagement ring,
the wedding ring,

40:56.955 --> 41:00.194
and then the suffering. See you tonight.

41:04.362 --> 41:06.132
Uh.

41:06.197 --> 41:08.635
What's going on? Did you find a doctor?

41:08.700 --> 41:11.538
Yeah, he's the one my cousin saw in Jersey.

41:11.603 --> 41:15.381
Billy's gonna drive me,
but it'll have to be on my day off.

41:18.009 --> 41:19.746
What's wrong with that?

41:19.811 --> 41:22.382
We just got a gig dancing
at the Sheldrake on Thursdays.

41:22.447 --> 41:25.385
- Oh, we can't afford to lose it.
- There must be someone to fill in.

41:25.450 --> 41:26.653
I asked everybody.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.756
Maria's working, so is Barb and Siobhan.

41:29.821 --> 41:32.592
Kellerman Jr. added belly dancing
to the schedule.

41:32.657 --> 41:35.094
- I know he's your boyfriend.
- He's not my boyfriend.

41:35.159 --> 41:36.729
There's gotta be somebody.

41:41.099 --> 41:42.335
What about her?

41:43.400 --> 41:44.872
Her?

41:45.537 --> 41:46.706
You gotta be kidding.

41:46.771 --> 41:48.273
Yeah, of course she's kidding.

41:48.339 --> 41:51.611
It's a mambo, exactly what Johnny's
been teaching you.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.679
And I'll help you learn the routine.

41:53.745 --> 41:55.815
You're a good teacher, Johnny.

41:55.880 --> 41:58.985
You can train anyone.

41:59.050 --> 42:00.520
Even her.

42:04.389 --> 42:06.062
I'm in if you're in.

42:11.930 --> 42:14.501
All right. With me, from the top.
Follow my lead.

42:14.566 --> 42:19.472
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

42:19.537 --> 42:20.974
One, two, three.

42:21.039 --> 42:22.709
Cross-body lead.

42:22.774 --> 42:24.711
Good.

42:24.776 --> 42:28.781
One, two, three. Five, six, seven.

42:28.846 --> 42:31.251
One, two, three.

42:31.316 --> 42:32.454
Here.

44:47.885 --> 44:50.156
Good. We got it.

44:50.221 --> 44:52.859
Now it's time to learn the lift.

44:52.924 --> 44:54.528
What lift?

45:02.166 --> 45:05.238
What are we doing here?
I thought we were doing the lift.

45:05.303 --> 45:08.708
We are. Gotta work on your balance.

45:08.773 --> 45:13.112
If you can dance here,
you can dance anywhere. Come on.

45:13.177 --> 45:17.421
I'm not stupid, you know?
Reverse psychology won't work on me.

45:19.117 --> 45:22.326
That's cool. Let's go home.

45:36.701 --> 45:38.840
The log is your friend.

46:03.327 --> 46:04.897
Okay?

47:06.824 --> 47:09.327
You ready?

47:09.393 --> 47:11.097
You good?

47:11.162 --> 47:12.505
Yeah.

47:15.566 --> 47:17.170
Whoo!

47:17.235 --> 47:19.038
All right, lifts are all about trust.

47:19.103 --> 47:22.414
I gotta trust you, too,
or else we could both get really hurt.

47:23.875 --> 47:27.747
Trust, trust, trust. Okay.

47:27.812 --> 47:30.082
Don't think. Trust.

47:30.147 --> 47:32.059
Okay.

47:33.551 --> 47:36.021
But what... what if I fall?

47:37.688 --> 47:40.293
- Can you swim?
- Yes, I can swim.

47:40.358 --> 47:41.727
There you go. You'll be fine.

47:41.792 --> 47:43.529
Does it matter which foot I start with?

47:43.594 --> 47:44.595
Whichever one is here,

47:44.662 --> 47:47.533
'cause the next one, you know...

47:47.598 --> 47:49.268
is gonna be in the water.

47:49.333 --> 47:51.404
Okay.

47:52.669 --> 47:54.440
Okay.

47:54.505 --> 47:55.779
Come on!

47:57.275 --> 47:58.276
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

47:58.342 --> 48:00.546
Okay, here we go.

48:00.611 --> 48:01.881
That's it! That's it!

48:01.946 --> 48:03.289
Oh!

48:06.549 --> 48:09.159
We're getting there.
You got another one like that?

48:10.388 --> 48:12.391
Up, lift!

48:13.124 --> 48:15.161
Two, three...

48:15.226 --> 48:17.629
Good, good, hold it!

48:22.432 --> 48:24.569
Come here, I got you.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.911
You're a good teacher.

48:31.976 --> 48:35.480
Yeah. Obviously.

48:36.614 --> 48:39.220
All right, come on. Let's go.

48:43.854 --> 48:45.258
Come on, you gonna lift <i>me</i> now?

48:45.323 --> 48:47.303
- No way.
- Come on...

48:54.665 --> 48:58.010
- Oh. Thank you.
- Yeah.

48:59.303 --> 49:00.748
Come on.

49:38.743 --> 49:40.347
What are you doing?

49:42.446 --> 49:43.982
The girls are out.

49:45.449 --> 49:46.587
I locked the door.

49:47.785 --> 49:49.822
It's broad daylight, Marjorie.

49:49.887 --> 49:52.992
Well, we are married.
I don't think anyone will mind.

49:53.057 --> 49:54.794
I just spent four hours golfing

49:54.859 --> 49:58.698
with that orthodontist
from Newton, Leon Feinberg.

49:58.763 --> 50:03.075
He talked nonstop to throw me
off my game, and it worked.

50:06.771 --> 50:08.842
You haven't touched me in almost a year.

50:10.074 --> 50:13.078
Can we please not have
this conversation right now?

50:13.144 --> 50:15.581
Why do I think I pushed you
to come back here?

50:15.646 --> 50:19.518
I has hoping that maybe
this place would remind you.

50:19.583 --> 50:23.022
The last time that we were here,
you couldn't keep your hands off me.

50:23.087 --> 50:24.757
Well, that was 10 years ago.

50:24.822 --> 50:28.661
I'm 45 years old, Jake. I'm not dead yet.

50:28.726 --> 50:30.313
I...

50:31.149 --> 50:32.613
Marge.

50:43.474 --> 50:45.852
- You mind?
- Please.

50:51.982 --> 50:53.621
That looks good.

50:54.919 --> 50:57.092
You should have one.

50:58.556 --> 51:01.594
You look really fantastic, by the way.

51:01.659 --> 51:04.397
Your husband must feel like
he won the lottery.

51:05.262 --> 51:07.433
He doesn't need to win the lottery.

51:07.498 --> 51:10.001
He's rich, filthy rich.

51:10.067 --> 51:12.038
Had nothing when we met.

51:12.103 --> 51:14.407
I actually married for love.

51:14.472 --> 51:17.976
So did I. My husband was a waiter here.

51:18.441 --> 51:20.046
No kidding.

51:20.911 --> 51:25.351
We'd love to invite you both
for a glass of wine tonight.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.520
Well, it's just me.

51:28.819 --> 51:30.222
We're divorced.

51:30.287 --> 51:31.657
Oh, I'm so sorry.

51:31.722 --> 51:33.692
Oh, don't be. I'm having a ball.

51:33.757 --> 51:36.162
I'm doing all the things he hated.

51:36.227 --> 51:39.697
I used to be a really good salsa dancer,

51:39.763 --> 51:43.035
but then I gave it up for Lent,
or marriage...

51:43.100 --> 51:45.737
kind of the same thing, don't you think?

51:47.004 --> 51:49.742
There's an upside to divorce, you know.

51:49.807 --> 51:51.480
You're free.

52:05.756 --> 52:08.727
Are you going?

52:08.792 --> 52:09.862
Yeah.

52:09.927 --> 52:11.697
Well, wait just a second.

52:11.762 --> 52:14.572
I... I have something for you.

52:23.240 --> 52:26.078
Thank you, Vivian, but really,
I can't take this.

52:26.143 --> 52:28.013
Oh, of course you can.

52:28.078 --> 52:30.816
It was my husband's. I don't need it anymore.

52:30.881 --> 52:33.259
It's valuable. You can sell it.

52:39.890 --> 52:41.861
Stay.

52:41.926 --> 52:45.430
Just... please stay, just... I...

52:47.331 --> 52:49.334
I can't stand to sleep alone.

52:51.035 --> 52:55.108
I just lie awake in the bed
and listen to the walls creak.

52:56.140 --> 52:57.847
I can't stay.

53:18.796 --> 53:19.797
Disappointed?

53:21.465 --> 53:24.203
No. Not at all.

53:24.268 --> 53:27.473
Johnny had a private lesson, so he sent me.

53:27.538 --> 53:29.141
He says you keep trying to lead.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.476
What?

53:30.541 --> 53:34.011
Mm, you have to let the man lead.

53:34.078 --> 53:37.516
Give me a frame, please. Thank you.

53:37.581 --> 53:40.686
One, two, three, four.

53:40.751 --> 53:43.522
One, two, three, four.

53:43.587 --> 53:46.258
One, two, three, four.

53:46.323 --> 53:49.762
One, two, three... you're leading.

53:50.527 --> 53:52.932
- I'm trying not to.
- Okay.

53:54.832 --> 53:58.037
When I put pressure here,
you go in that direction.

53:58.102 --> 54:00.438
Like a dog being pulled on a leash?

54:00.503 --> 54:02.775
No, not like a dog.

54:02.840 --> 54:07.112
Like a woman dancing with a man.

54:07.177 --> 54:09.453
There's power in letting go.

54:11.181 --> 54:13.185
I think you're brainwashed.

54:14.184 --> 54:16.755
I think you're too much in your head, Baby,

54:16.820 --> 54:18.993
'cause dancing comes from down here.

54:20.190 --> 54:23.865
You get to tease him, make him work for it.

54:25.195 --> 54:26.640
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

54:36.674 --> 54:39.345
<i># Ooh #</i>

56:24.515 --> 56:26.352
<i># We got chicken in the barn #</i>

56:26.417 --> 56:27.653
- <i># Whose barn? #</i>
- <i># What barn? #</i>

56:27.718 --> 56:28.719
<i># My barn #</i>

56:28.786 --> 56:30.255
<i># Come on over, baby #</i>

56:30.320 --> 56:32.991
<i># We got the bull by the horn #</i>

56:34.224 --> 56:35.994
<i># We ain't fakin' #</i>

56:36.059 --> 56:39.131
<i># A whole lotta shakin' goin' on #</i>

<i># Easy now #</i>

56:40.464 --> 56:41.533
<i># Shake it #</i>

56:41.598 --> 56:42.599
<i># Yeah, shake it #</i>

56:42.666 --> 56:44.570
<i># Oh, I said shake it, baby #</i>

56:44.635 --> 56:46.372
<i># Yeah #</i>

56:46.437 --> 56:48.874
<i>Shake it one time for me. Whoo!</i>

56:48.939 --> 56:51.442
<i># Yeah #</i>

56:51.508 --> 56:53.511
<i># Well, I said come on over, baby #</i>

56:53.577 --> 56:55.614
<i># Whole lotta shakin' goin' on #</i>

56:55.679 --> 57:00.285
- <i>Now let's get real low one time.</i>
- <i># I said, shake, baby, shake #</i>

57:00.350 --> 57:01.754
<i>All you gotta do, honey...</i>

57:01.819 --> 57:04.156
- <i>What?</i>
- <i>...is kind of stand in one spot...</i>

57:04.221 --> 57:06.291
- <i>All right.</i>
- <i>...wiggle around just a little bit...</i>

57:06.356 --> 57:08.359
- <i>Give it to me, now.</i>
- <i>...now, that's what you gotta do.</i>

57:08.425 --> 57:09.561
- <i>Ow!</i>
- <i>Yeah!</i>

57:09.626 --> 57:10.696
<i># Oh, baby #</i>

57:10.761 --> 57:13.232
<i># Whole lotta shakin' goin' on #</i>

57:13.297 --> 57:15.000
<i># Baby, just let go #</i>

57:15.065 --> 57:17.269
<i># Shake, baby, shake it #</i>

57:17.334 --> 57:20.372
<i># Shake, baby, shake it #</i>

57:20.437 --> 57:23.675
- <i># Shake, baby, shake it #</i>
- <i># Shake it, baby, shake it #</i>

57:23.740 --> 57:26.211
<i># Shake it, baby, shake it #</i>

57:26.276 --> 57:28.113
- <i># Come on over #</i>

57:28.178 --> 57:29.581
<i># Whole lotta shakin' #</i>

57:29.646 --> 57:34.386
<i># Whole lotta shakin' goin' on #</i>

57:34.451 --> 57:37.694
<i># Oh, oh, oh, oh. #</i>

57:40.957 --> 57:44.928
Don't fuss. That's how it's supposed to fit.

57:46.696 --> 57:49.033
What if I get stage fright
and forget everything I learned?

57:49.098 --> 57:51.136
- You won't.
- How do you know?

57:51.201 --> 57:54.940
Because you've done all the hard work,
and because Johnny's a pro.

57:55.005 --> 57:58.910
And as long as you let him lead,
you'll never lose your way.

57:58.975 --> 58:03.315
Let him lead, shoulders down,
lock my frame...

58:03.380 --> 58:05.450
Don't forget to breathe.

58:05.515 --> 58:08.018
And have fun with it. You're gonna be great.

58:10.553 --> 58:11.964
Hey, I, um...

58:13.590 --> 58:16.400
I wanna thank you for what you did for me.

58:18.228 --> 58:19.639
And I want you to know...

58:21.197 --> 58:22.972
I don't sleep around.

58:24.401 --> 58:26.881
I thought he loved me.

58:29.539 --> 58:31.485
Hey.

58:33.476 --> 58:37.015
You're gonna be fine tonight.

58:37.080 --> 58:38.550
So are you.

58:38.615 --> 58:41.252
Come on, let's go, ladies!

58:57.334 --> 58:59.143
What do you think?

59:32.035 --> 59:37.576
<i># Just a little piece of me. #</i>

59:40.477 --> 59:41.888
That was beautiful.

59:43.213 --> 59:45.483
Thank you. Do you play?

59:45.548 --> 59:48.753
Me? Oh, no, I'm not musical at all.

59:48.818 --> 59:51.256
I don't believe that for a second. Come on.

59:51.321 --> 59:54.459
I... I don't think so. I have small fingers.

59:54.524 --> 59:57.733
I have just the thing.

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:03.558
Perfect for small fingers.

01:00:13.343 --> 01:00:16.153
Oh, just... here.

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.395
Look at that. You'll be
better than me in no time.

01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:31.763
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'm serious.

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.535
Marco?

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:38.970
It's almost show time. Shouldn't
you be getting dressed?

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:41.673
Sure thing, boss.

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.615
Hey, will you teach me more later?

01:00:45.608 --> 01:00:48.046
Um...

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.751
The summer's almost over.

01:00:52.749 --> 01:00:55.491
But I'll try, okay?

01:00:56.786 --> 01:00:58.095
Mm-hmm.

01:00:59.889 --> 01:01:04.861
If you care to come back here next year,
you'll stick to the job we pay you for.

01:01:04.928 --> 01:01:07.932
We weren't doing anything.
She wants to learn the ukulele.

01:01:07.997 --> 01:01:11.001
I don't care what she wants,
and neither does her daddy.

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:16.279
Leave the little white girls alone.

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:29.854
The Sheldrake Hotel is proud to present

01:01:29.919 --> 01:01:32.190
tonight's spotlight dance team...

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:36.561
Castle and Johnson in "Mambo Magic"!

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.892
Cross body-lead.

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:22.748
Breathe.

01:02:41.925 --> 01:02:44.428
Angel lift. Come on.

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:51.669
All right.

01:02:51.734 --> 01:02:53.236
It's okay.

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.515
- I started on the two!
- You did.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.517
Every move I made,
you were right there with me.

01:03:39.582 --> 01:03:41.686
- Oh, I choked on the lift.
- Screw the lift.

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:44.027
Did you see Mr. Louis out there? He loved us.

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:50.061
You know, me and Penny, we collect
each paycheck like it's our last.

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:53.865
Stretch it out, travel light.
It's a gypsy life.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:57.210
But this gig, this could
change things for us,

01:03:57.290 --> 01:04:00.838
give us a home base,
let us breathe, like she said.

01:04:00.903 --> 01:04:01.973
That's all thanks to you.

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:03.708
Oh, no, you guys deserve the job.

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.743
Yeah, but you helped us keep it.

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.478
I give you a lot of credit, Baby.

01:04:07.543 --> 01:04:09.447
What you did in there,
in front of all those people?

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.288
That takes guts.
Not a lot of people have that.

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:16.821
It's almost midnight.
I gotta get Tito his car back.

01:04:16.886 --> 01:04:19.524
Come on, get up here. I'm not your chauffeur.

01:04:43.179 --> 01:04:47.159
Johnny! Johnny! Johnny, hurry!
It's Penny! She's in her cabin!

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:59.798
Dad? Daddy?

01:04:59.863 --> 01:05:02.267
Daddy, I need your help.

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:03.709
What's wrong?

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:15.649
It's okay, breathe. Breathe, shh.

01:05:17.481 --> 01:05:19.585
Let him in. He's a doctor.

01:05:24.688 --> 01:05:26.031
What happened?

01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:33.165
If you want me to help her, I need to know.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.434
The guy said he was a real doctor.

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:37.240
Did he wear any gloves?

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:41.640
Okay.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:47.245
I can't help you unless I examine you,

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:49.214
and I'm sure that's the last
thing you want right now.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:52.017
But this is very serious.
You should probably go to the hospital.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:54.252
No, no. No way.

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.695
Let the doctor look at you, Penny.

01:05:59.389 --> 01:06:01.733
I assume you're responsible for this girl.

01:06:05.028 --> 01:06:06.231
Yes.

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:08.367
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:06:12.569 --> 01:06:14.446
All right, everybody out.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:36.697
I'm Dr. Houseman. I'm gonna take care of you.

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:41.400
Why did you do that?

01:06:41.465 --> 01:06:45.436
- Does it matter?
- Yeah. It matters.

01:06:46.436 --> 01:06:47.706
It's not true.

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:51.409
I don't care what he thinks of me,
as long as he takes care of Penny.

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:56.652
That guy was a hack.

01:06:58.615 --> 01:07:00.752
- Probably used dirty equipment.
- Is she gonna be okay?

01:07:00.817 --> 01:07:03.121
Well, time will tell.

01:07:03.186 --> 01:07:04.790
I did what any emergency room
would have done.

01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:07.826
I put her on antibiotics, gave her
something to help her sleep.

01:07:07.891 --> 01:07:09.227
I'll check on her in the morning.

01:07:09.292 --> 01:07:10.629
Thank you so much for your help, doctor.

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:13.698
- We really appreciate...
- She could have died tonight.

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:16.370
And you, you weren't even there with her.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:19.941
What kind of man does that?

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:24.285
Don't ever come near my daughter again.

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:26.943
Are we clear?

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.150
Yes, sir.

01:07:32.315 --> 01:07:35.660
We're leaving, Baby, now. Now!

01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:43.428
Was that where my money went...
the money you lied about?

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:45.430
I was afraid to tell you the truth.

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:47.532
I thought we had a close,
honest relationship.

01:07:47.597 --> 01:07:49.000
- Since when do you lie?
- I don't!

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:52.304
And not that it matters to you,
but here's what I think of that guy.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.039
He's not good enough to wash my car.

01:07:54.104 --> 01:07:55.974
You're not to associate with him again.

01:07:56.039 --> 01:07:57.242
Yes, Daddy.

01:07:57.307 --> 01:07:59.878
You're not who I thought you were.

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:01.946
- Not by half.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:02.012 --> 01:08:03.815
I bragged about you
to anyone who would listen.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:05.283
I thought you hung the moon.

01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:06.785
Please, Daddy, just let me explain.

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:08.352
Did you know it was illegal,

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.421
and that by helping her,
you could go to jail?

01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:12.290
Use your brain, Baby,

01:08:12.355 --> 01:08:15.260
that amazing brain I spent my entire life
filling with everything I know.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:17.930
- You're not a kid anymore.
- Then stop treating me like one.

01:08:19.962 --> 01:08:22.307
And stop calling me Baby.

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.339
I'm 18 years old.

01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:32.410
You're right. My job is done.

01:08:32.475 --> 01:08:34.279
Good luck, Frances.

01:08:58.702 --> 01:09:00.772
Can I come in?

01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.749
You shouldn't be here.

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:11.649
My dad shouldn't have
talked to you like that.

01:09:13.783 --> 01:09:16.654
- He's wrong about you.
- No, he's not.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:18.689
I should have been there with her.

01:09:18.755 --> 01:09:21.493
Instead, I was off hustling another gig,

01:09:21.558 --> 01:09:23.629
being a big shot.

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:27.270
- Your dad's a smart guy.
- No.

01:09:28.965 --> 01:09:30.769
Not about this.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:32.304
You should have told him the truth.

01:09:32.368 --> 01:09:35.839
It wouldn't make any difference.

01:09:35.906 --> 01:09:37.876
He thinks I'm not good enough for you.

01:09:37.941 --> 01:09:39.644
And he's right.

01:09:39.709 --> 01:09:42.814
You're gonna go off to college,
make a difference in the world,

01:09:42.879 --> 01:09:45.189
and when you look back on your life,
you're gonna be proud.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:48.492
What am I gonna look back on?

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:53.358
- Dancing.
- Dancing.

01:09:53.423 --> 01:09:55.727
The way you dance?

01:09:55.792 --> 01:09:57.596
It's beautiful and inspiring.

01:09:57.661 --> 01:09:59.436
Do you know why I dance?

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:05.904
'Cause this is the only thing
I was ever good at.

01:10:05.969 --> 01:10:08.306
I wasn't like you, Baby.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:13.218
Every time I look at a book, the letters
start swimming around on the page.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.547
So I dropped out of school.

01:10:16.613 --> 01:10:18.950
Hung around my cousin's garage.

01:10:19.015 --> 01:10:20.886
He and his buddies
taught me how to hot wire cars

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:23.522
and sell them off in parts.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:27.496
It was a great gig until I got caught.

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:32.998
I served nine months in county jail.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:38.037
And when I got home...

01:10:40.303 --> 01:10:42.943
my father had changed the locks on the door.

01:10:47.978 --> 01:10:50.015
I was 15.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.888
Are you trying to scare me away?

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:58.657
Yes.

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:00.959
You aced the final exam,
just like you ace everything.

01:11:01.024 --> 01:11:04.563
Congratulations. Now please,
get out of my life.

01:11:07.497 --> 01:11:09.272
Will you do me one favor?

01:11:13.737 --> 01:11:15.373
Will you dance with me one more time?

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:16.541
Come on, Baby.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:19.527
Please. Tonight happened so fast.

01:11:19.592 --> 01:11:21.902
I wanna remember it.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:26.824
And then, I swear I'll leave you
alone after that.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.298
"How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Practice!"

01:14:44.363 --> 01:14:46.300
Start you next career today,

01:14:46.365 --> 01:14:49.170
and sign up for Kellerman's
end-of-the-season talent show.

01:14:49.235 --> 01:14:51.939
I saw that. It's okay. That's her point.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:03.490
May I have the milk, please?

01:15:09.789 --> 01:15:11.859
Thanks.

01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:12.925
Good morning, everybody.

01:15:12.992 --> 01:15:15.463
Hope you're all performing
in our talent show.

01:15:15.528 --> 01:15:18.966
I'm sorry to say we're, uh...
we can't. We're leaving early.

01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:20.738
We're gonna beat the weekend traffic.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:25.382
Oh. Well, maybe next year.

01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:33.281
What? We can't leave. I'm singing a duet.

01:15:33.346 --> 01:15:34.949
I learned to play the ukulele and everything.

01:15:35.014 --> 01:15:38.085
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I have patients I need to see.

01:15:38.150 --> 01:15:41.122
I'll try to make it up to you.

01:15:41.187 --> 01:15:43.157
Do you wanna go
to the driving range this morning?

01:15:43.222 --> 01:15:44.326
I'll teach you how to golf.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.963
Me? Sure.

01:15:49.028 --> 01:15:50.564
Okay.

01:15:54.834 --> 01:15:56.780
Mom, can you change his mind about leaving?

01:15:58.204 --> 01:16:01.442
Probably not. I'm sorry, girls.

01:16:01.507 --> 01:16:04.078
He's not mad at you. He's mad at me.

01:16:04.143 --> 01:16:06.113
Why would he be mad at you?

01:16:06.178 --> 01:16:08.317
He's just in a mood.

01:16:11.751 --> 01:16:14.655
Well, you should be able to go
back to work in a couple days.

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.529
Thank you, doctor.

01:16:17.723 --> 01:16:21.128
Penny, I'm not your father,
and this is really not my place.

01:16:21.193 --> 01:16:24.436
But any medical scare is a wake-up call.

01:16:25.431 --> 01:16:27.602
It's time to take stock of your life.

01:16:27.667 --> 01:16:29.637
I always tell this to my patients,

01:16:29.702 --> 01:16:32.540
so when you're my age,
and you're looking back on your life

01:16:32.605 --> 01:16:36.310
and the choices you made, good or bad...

01:16:36.375 --> 01:16:39.780
you don't have any regrets.

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:45.557
Maybe you do, but they
don't take you by surprise.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:49.323
I'll check on you tomorrow.

01:16:49.388 --> 01:16:52.699
Oh, thanks, doc. You're the best.

01:17:10.409 --> 01:17:12.647
So that's me, huh?

01:17:12.712 --> 01:17:16.216
- Big regret?
- Leave it alone, Johnny.

01:17:16.282 --> 01:17:18.586
- What if he tells Kellerman?
- He won't.

01:17:18.651 --> 01:17:21.029
- How do you know?
- 'Cause I asked him not to.

01:17:22.421 --> 01:17:23.593
And I trust him.

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:27.328
Hey.

01:17:27.393 --> 01:17:29.764
You just missed your father.

01:17:29.829 --> 01:17:31.706
He's such a great guy.

01:17:35.101 --> 01:17:39.641
Hey, all this commotion,
and I never heard how last night went.

01:17:41.307 --> 01:17:43.343
- Good.
- Fine.

01:17:44.844 --> 01:17:46.280
I didn't do the lift, but...

01:17:46.345 --> 01:17:48.215
Mr. Louis was crazy about us.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.851
Oh, that's great!

01:17:50.916 --> 01:17:53.587
I hope he likes me as much as he likes Baby.

01:17:54.152 --> 01:17:56.695
Come on, you're a star.

01:17:57.857 --> 01:18:01.562
I'm gonna go, but I'll see you guys later?

01:18:01.627 --> 01:18:03.004
Yeah.

01:18:13.539 --> 01:18:14.574
What are you doing?

01:18:15.675 --> 01:18:16.744
What?

01:18:16.809 --> 01:18:19.747
How many times have you told me
not to get mixed up with them?

01:18:19.812 --> 01:18:21.082
She's different.

01:18:21.147 --> 01:18:24.986
She's a peach. But that's not the point.

01:18:25.051 --> 01:18:28.521
Kellerman's all over us. Please.

01:18:28.587 --> 01:18:31.625
I messed up enough for the both of us
this summer.

01:18:31.691 --> 01:18:34.069
Promise me you'll end it.

01:18:40.766 --> 01:18:41.836
Johnny.

01:18:41.901 --> 01:18:44.872
I can't talk right now.
I got to cover class for Penny.

01:18:44.937 --> 01:18:47.808
- Okay. Can we talk later?
- I have to work.

01:18:47.873 --> 01:18:50.752
I'm not on vacation like you.
I actually work here.

01:19:11.263 --> 01:19:13.534
I missed you last night.

01:19:13.599 --> 01:19:15.169
Oh.

01:19:15.234 --> 01:19:17.237
Sorry. I had a gig.

01:19:18.971 --> 01:19:20.644
A better gig than me?

01:19:22.374 --> 01:19:23.478
I'll make it up to you tonight.

01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:32.959
I'll come by later.

01:19:37.388 --> 01:19:41.796
Greetings, ladies and gentlemen.
We're in for a very special treat tonight.

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:46.584
One of my favorite guests...
Mrs. Marjorie Houseman.

01:19:53.739 --> 01:19:56.377
Hi, everyone.

01:19:56.442 --> 01:19:59.651
I met my husband here... in this room.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:04.351
The band was playing a beautiful song.

01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:07.555
I've been working on it for the talent show.

01:20:07.620 --> 01:20:09.657
But...

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:12.202
it turns out we have to leave early.

01:20:13.425 --> 01:20:16.429
So I hope that you'll indulge me.

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:27.043
<i># Our romance won't end on a sorrowful note #</i>

01:20:28.808 --> 01:20:32.449
<i># Though by tomorrow, you're gone #</i>

01:20:34.380 --> 01:20:36.650
<i># The song has ended #</i>

01:20:36.715 --> 01:20:40.754
<i># But as the songwriter wrote #</i>

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:47.227
<i># The melody lingers on #</i>

01:20:47.293 --> 01:20:52.166
<i># They may take you from me #</i>

01:20:52.231 --> 01:20:57.638
<i># I'll miss your fond caress #</i>

01:20:57.703 --> 01:21:01.776
<i># But though they take you from me #</i>

01:21:01.841 --> 01:21:06.747
<i># I'll still possess #</i>

01:21:06.812 --> 01:21:09.884
<i># The way you wear your hat #</i>

01:21:11.717 --> 01:21:16.457
<i># The way you sip your tea #</i>

01:21:16.522 --> 01:21:20.129
<i># The memory of all that #</i>

01:21:21.393 --> 01:21:27.401
<i># Oh, no, they can't take away from me #</i>

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:32.339
<i># We may never, never meet again #</i>

01:21:32.404 --> 01:21:36.677
<i># On the bumpy road to love #</i>

01:21:36.742 --> 01:21:40.181
<i># Still I'll always, always #</i>

01:21:40.246 --> 01:21:45.419
<i># Keep the memory of #</i>

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:49.824
<i># The way you hold your knife #</i>

01:21:49.889 --> 01:21:54.861
<i># The way we danced till 3:00 #</i>

01:21:54.927 --> 01:21:59.834
<i># The way you changed my life #</i>

01:21:59.899 --> 01:22:04.939
<i># Oh, no, they can't take that away from me #</i>

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:09.953
<i># No, they can't take that away #</i>

01:22:11.277 --> 01:22:16.192
<i># Away from me. #</i>

01:22:28.644 --> 01:22:30.590
Johnny, I know you're in there!

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:40.930
You can't do this to me!

01:22:43.525 --> 01:22:45.996
You can't just act like you've never met me,

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:48.132
like this thing never happened!

01:22:52.835 --> 01:22:56.206
You know, you may act like you're
this too-cool-for-school jackass,

01:22:56.271 --> 01:22:58.376
but you don't fool me!

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:02.413
Because I know you...

01:23:02.478 --> 01:23:05.114
...and I know that this thing
meant something...

01:23:19.962 --> 01:23:23.267
Marjorie, what... we can stay.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.468
It's only a few more days.

01:23:24.533 --> 01:23:27.338
Lisa's got her heart set on the talent show.

01:23:27.403 --> 01:23:30.441
Please, unpack.

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:33.348
I don't need more drama.

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:35.779
Wow.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:36.914
Well, what do you want me to say?

01:23:36.979 --> 01:23:39.616
That... that I love you,
I can't live without you?

01:23:39.681 --> 01:23:43.120
Well, of course you can live without me,
Jake. You've been at it for a while.

01:23:43.185 --> 01:23:45.456
You know, I used to play a game.

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.725
From the time you got home from work,

01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:51.662
how long would it take for you
to say anything to me?

01:23:51.727 --> 01:23:54.207
You wanna hear your best time?

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.267
Fourteen hours.

01:23:57.332 --> 01:23:58.502
You came home at 6:00.

01:23:58.567 --> 01:24:00.371
You said, "Toast, please" the next morning.

01:24:00.436 --> 01:24:02.606
Look, I deal with life and death all day.

01:24:02.671 --> 01:24:04.908
- Yeah.
- And when I lose a patient,

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:07.811
it takes away a little bit of my soul.
I don't wanna burden you with that.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:10.714
Burden me, please! At least we'd be talking!

01:24:10.779 --> 01:24:11.849
We live like roommates.

01:24:11.914 --> 01:24:15.619
And now the girls are grown,
and well, you've got your job,

01:24:15.684 --> 01:24:17.454
and I don't know what to do with myself.

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.021
So, take up needlepoint or gardening.

01:24:19.088 --> 01:24:21.992
I don't need a hobby, Jake. I need a husband.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:24.367
- I'm right here!
- No, you're not!

01:24:27.329 --> 01:24:29.502
I think we should consider
living apart for a while.

01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.069
I called a lawyer.

01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:35.539
You did what? You...

01:24:35.604 --> 01:24:38.141
What, you're asking for a divorce?

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:40.209
Yes.

01:24:43.412 --> 01:24:46.350
That makes no sense.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.819
I've been faithful to you.

01:24:48.884 --> 01:24:52.489
I've provided for you and the girls.
I've given you everything you wanted.

01:24:52.554 --> 01:24:54.858
Not everything, Jake.

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.698
So, you'd rather be alone...

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:00.164
than be married to me?

01:25:01.497 --> 01:25:05.878
Yes. I'd rather be alone than lonely.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:21.985
Marco?

01:25:22.050 --> 01:25:24.053
- What's wrong?
- Have you seen my sister?

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:25.989
No, not tonight.

01:25:26.054 --> 01:25:28.728
I need to find her. Will you help me?

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:34.296
Please?

01:25:35.597 --> 01:25:38.077
Sure. I'll help you.

01:25:57.186 --> 01:25:59.063
Maybe she's back at the cabin.

01:26:01.190 --> 01:26:03.393
It's over.

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:05.370
What is?

01:26:06.361 --> 01:26:09.033
My family is falling apart.

01:26:10.098 --> 01:26:12.902
I thought my parents would
be married forever, and...

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:27.050
Uh, come on.
I'll walk you back to your cabin.

01:26:27.115 --> 01:26:29.219
Just because it's dark.

01:26:29.284 --> 01:26:31.321
And then I'll leave.

01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:33.766
I'm a gentleman.

01:26:35.257 --> 01:26:36.702
I know.

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.305
I don't understand why you're here.

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:49.747
That good, huh?

01:26:52.274 --> 01:26:54.578
I mean... I don't understand

01:26:54.643 --> 01:26:57.481
why you're dancing
at a place like Kellerman's.

01:26:57.546 --> 01:27:00.317
You should be on Broadway.

01:27:00.382 --> 01:27:02.953
Yeah, right.

01:27:03.018 --> 01:27:05.389
Why not?

01:27:05.454 --> 01:27:06.956
'Cause it would never work out.

01:27:07.022 --> 01:27:08.992
How do you know?

01:27:09.057 --> 01:27:11.128
It's easy for you to say.

01:27:11.193 --> 01:27:14.197
Your life's one big happy-ever-after.

01:27:14.263 --> 01:27:16.466
That's not true.

01:27:16.531 --> 01:27:19.169
I work my ass off.

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:22.238
Because you believe things will work out
for you in the end.

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.979
I wasn't born that way, you know.

01:27:29.044 --> 01:27:31.024
It was a choice.

01:27:32.381 --> 01:27:36.119
I mean... we're all gonna be
worm food eventually, anyway,

01:27:36.184 --> 01:27:39.089
so might as well make it count, right?

01:27:42.491 --> 01:27:44.628
Johnny? I know you're in there.

01:27:44.693 --> 01:27:46.763
I heard voices.

01:27:46.828 --> 01:27:48.999
If I want another rat bastard in my life,

01:27:49.064 --> 01:27:51.067
I'll... I'll get another husband.

01:27:51.133 --> 01:27:53.203
Ugh.

01:27:53.268 --> 01:27:56.073
Do tell.

01:27:56.138 --> 01:27:58.107
She means nothing to me.

01:27:58.172 --> 01:28:01.678
Seriously. She's a bungalow bunny.

01:28:01.743 --> 01:28:04.615
What is a bungalow bunny?

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:07.050
They're these lonely, middle-aged women

01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:10.654
who stuff room keys in your pocket.

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:14.424
And they what? Give you money?

01:28:14.489 --> 01:28:17.361
Or gifts. Depends.

01:28:21.697 --> 01:28:23.336
I don't do it for the money.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:28.274
It feels good to be wanted...

01:28:30.572 --> 01:28:32.575
by women like that.

01:28:34.242 --> 01:28:35.653
Classy women...

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.225
who wear silk underwear and...

01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:41.921
fancy perfume.

01:28:47.789 --> 01:28:50.929
Am I a bungalow bunny?

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.569
No.

01:29:17.619 --> 01:29:20.791
Where the hell were you? I looked everywhere.

01:29:20.856 --> 01:29:22.926
Did I miss something?

01:29:22.991 --> 01:29:26.029
You missed a lot.

01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:28.438
Got your head in the clouds lately.

01:29:30.465 --> 01:29:32.377
What happened?

01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:36.977
Mom said she wants a divorce.

01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.347
What?

01:29:42.911 --> 01:29:44.891
Well, that can't be real.

01:29:46.648 --> 01:29:48.719
I heard her tell Dad.

01:29:50.786 --> 01:29:52.390
She called a lawyer.

01:29:56.425 --> 01:29:58.564
What are we gonna do, Baby?

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.935
We'll figure it out.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.707
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:30:13.775 --> 01:30:15.584
Your dress is undone.

01:30:24.519 --> 01:30:25.691
Your hair is...

01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:33.041
Did...

01:30:35.597 --> 01:30:37.401
Did you...

01:30:37.466 --> 01:30:40.370
Did you sleep with someone?

01:30:43.505 --> 01:30:45.642
Oh, my God.

01:30:46.307 --> 01:30:48.178
My baby sister.

01:30:48.243 --> 01:30:50.648
I haven't even done it yet.

01:30:51.179 --> 01:30:55.460
Wow. Neil doesn't seem the type.
Then again, neither do you.

01:30:59.554 --> 01:31:01.531
It wasn't Neil.

01:31:02.090 --> 01:31:05.395
Who was it? Oh, you have to tell me.

01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.737
- Please don't make me.
- Baby, don't make this difficult.

01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:12.205
Johnny Castle.

01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:15.772
- The dance teacher?
- Shh.

01:31:15.837 --> 01:31:18.975
- He's too old for you.
- No, he's not.

01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:21.812
Of all the guys here, why would you
give yourself to him?

01:31:29.451 --> 01:31:31.788
He taught me to dance.

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:34.857
That's his job. He's a dance teacher.

01:31:34.923 --> 01:31:36.660
No, Lisa.

01:31:36.725 --> 01:31:39.831
You don't understand. I...

01:31:44.065 --> 01:31:45.969
I love him.

01:31:59.097 --> 01:32:02.502
This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.

01:32:02.567 --> 01:32:05.480
I don't go into yours
and you don't go into mine.

01:32:08.406 --> 01:32:10.476
This was your idea, genius.

01:32:13.645 --> 01:32:14.781
<i># Sylvia? #</i>

01:32:14.846 --> 01:32:16.816
<i># Yes, Mickey? #</i>

01:32:16.881 --> 01:32:19.586
<i># How you call your Lover Boy? #</i>

01:32:19.651 --> 01:32:21.221
<i># Come here, Lover Boy #</i>

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:23.623
<i># And if he doesn't answer? #</i>

01:32:23.688 --> 01:32:25.592
<i># Oh, Lover Boy #</i>

01:32:25.657 --> 01:32:27.527
<i># And if he still doesn't answer? #</i>

01:32:27.592 --> 01:32:28.928
<i># I simply say #</i>

01:32:28.993 --> 01:32:31.831
<i># Baby #</i>

01:32:31.896 --> 01:32:35.735
<i># O-oh, baby #</i>

01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:39.539
<i># My sweet baby #</i>

01:32:39.604 --> 01:32:41.846

<i># Baby #</i>

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:51.718

<i># My sweet baby #</i>

01:32:55.887 --> 01:32:58.124
<i># You're the one #</i>

01:33:07.899 --> 01:33:11.039
Look under the bed. Check in every drawer.

01:33:12.403 --> 01:33:14.940
Hey. What the hell is this?

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:18.411
I have the right to search
any property on the premises.

01:33:18.476 --> 01:33:19.746
Read your contract.

01:33:19.811 --> 01:33:21.047
Why? What are you looking for?

01:33:21.112 --> 01:33:23.516
One of the guests lost an item.

01:33:23.581 --> 01:33:24.951
And you think I took it?

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:26.986
Hey, don't touch those.

01:33:27.051 --> 01:33:30.156
Hey, hey, hey, cool your jets, son.
The police are on the way.

01:33:30.221 --> 01:33:31.324
This is crazy.

01:33:31.389 --> 01:33:33.392
Uh-huh.

01:33:33.458 --> 01:33:36.462
- Grandfather.
- A Rolex.

01:33:37.662 --> 01:33:40.233
Pretty fancy timepiece on a dancer's salary.

01:33:40.298 --> 01:33:43.403
- Vivian Pressman gave it to me as a gift.
- Mm.

01:33:43.468 --> 01:33:45.471
And I turned it down.

01:33:46.536 --> 01:33:49.175
It doesn't <i>look</i> as if you turned it down.

01:34:05.924 --> 01:34:07.794
Johnny!

01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:21.507
Turns out he has a record
as long as my arm...

01:34:21.572 --> 01:34:24.444
petty larceny, grand theft auto.

01:34:25.109 --> 01:34:27.113
Max, that's terrible.

01:34:27.178 --> 01:34:30.016
People don't usually put
that stuff on their résumé.

01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:32.819
Why would he risk his job
by doing something so stupid?

01:34:32.884 --> 01:34:36.723
Exactly. Why would he do that?

01:34:36.788 --> 01:34:38.157
Maybe he needed the money.

01:34:38.222 --> 01:34:43.429
He snuck into her room last night
while she was asleep and stole it.

01:34:43.494 --> 01:34:45.431
Wait... last night?

01:34:45.496 --> 01:34:46.833
Well, that's what she says.

01:34:46.898 --> 01:34:50.903
She had it during the day,
and the next morning, it was gone.

01:34:50.969 --> 01:34:52.272
Does he have an alibi?

01:34:52.337 --> 01:34:54.040
He says he was in his room all night.

01:34:54.105 --> 01:34:56.542
By himself. Reading.

01:34:56.607 --> 01:34:59.645
You think we found any books in his room?

01:35:00.411 --> 01:35:01.848
Johnny didn't steal that watch.

01:35:01.913 --> 01:35:04.150
Honey, let's not get involved.

01:35:04.215 --> 01:35:05.551
No. I know he didn't.

01:35:05.616 --> 01:35:07.493
Baby, don't.

01:35:11.723 --> 01:35:14.568
He <i>was</i> in his room all night.

01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:19.002
And he was with <i>me</i> all night.

01:35:23.234 --> 01:35:24.804
He never left his room.

01:35:30.775 --> 01:35:34.587
Vivian Pressman came by last night,
pounding on the door.

01:35:35.646 --> 01:35:39.218
She was angry and jealous.

01:35:39.283 --> 01:35:41.661
She obviously wanted to punish him.

01:35:44.589 --> 01:35:46.831
I need to go down to the police station.

01:35:49.827 --> 01:35:51.272
Please, I need a ride.

01:35:55.767 --> 01:35:58.338
She's a grown woman.
She doesn't need my permission.

01:36:49.821 --> 01:36:53.200
<i># The way you wear your hat #</i>

01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:59.772
<i># The way you sip your tea #</i>

01:37:01.699 --> 01:37:05.647
<i># The memory of all that #</i>

01:37:07.672 --> 01:37:12.644
<i># No, they can't take that away from me #</i>

01:37:12.710 --> 01:37:16.453
<i># The way you smile just beams #</i>

01:37:18.382 --> 01:37:22.125
<i># The way you sing off-key #</i>

01:37:24.222 --> 01:37:28.227
<i># The way you haunt my dreams #</i>

01:37:29.961 --> 01:37:35.240
<i># No, they can't take that away from me #</i>

01:37:36.734 --> 01:37:42.675
<i># We may never, never meet again #</i>

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:48.081
<i># On that bumpy road to love #</i>

01:37:48.146 --> 01:37:53.619
<i># Still, I'll always, always keep #</i>

01:37:53.684 --> 01:37:56.062
<i># The memory of #</i>

01:37:57.722 --> 01:38:01.500
<i># The way you hold your knife #</i>

01:38:03.628 --> 01:38:08.935
<i># The way we danced till 3:00 #</i>

01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:14.874
<i># The way you changed my life #</i>

01:38:14.939 --> 01:38:20.713
<i># No, they can't take that away from me #</i>

01:38:20.778 --> 01:38:25.451
<i># No, they can't take that #</i>

01:38:25.516 --> 01:38:29.988
<i># Away from me. #</i>

01:38:39.730 --> 01:38:42.176
I had no idea you could play.

01:38:43.234 --> 01:38:44.679
I don't anymore.

01:38:46.804 --> 01:38:48.044
Why not?

01:38:49.707 --> 01:38:51.144
You sound great.

01:38:51.209 --> 01:38:53.621
Well, I played a little in college and...

01:38:55.079 --> 01:38:57.924
the time comes to put away childish things.

01:38:59.483 --> 01:39:01.019
You should buy a piano for the house.

01:39:01.085 --> 01:39:02.962
Not interested.

01:39:08.492 --> 01:39:10.096
Are you interested in me, Dad?

01:39:11.996 --> 01:39:16.102
I'm sorry that I didn't live up
to your expectations.

01:39:16.167 --> 01:39:17.874
I'm not perfect.

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:22.642
I don't hang the moon.

01:39:22.707 --> 01:39:26.120
What do you want from me?

01:39:29.013 --> 01:39:30.383
I want you to be my father,

01:39:30.448 --> 01:39:34.187
not just when I'm acing
my classes and winning awards

01:39:34.252 --> 01:39:37.123
and becoming a junior version of you.

01:39:37.188 --> 01:39:38.791
I never <i>made</i> you do anything.

01:39:38.856 --> 01:39:40.960
You didn't <i>have to, Dad.</i>

01:39:41.025 --> 01:39:44.495
I <i>wanted</i> to please you. And I still do.

01:39:44.562 --> 01:39:46.632
But I also wanna know that
you're not just gonna banish me

01:39:46.697 --> 01:39:48.734
for making choices that you don't agree with.

01:39:48.799 --> 01:39:52.238
That... kid...

01:39:52.303 --> 01:39:54.774
the dance teacher, he's a lowlife.

01:39:54.839 --> 01:39:56.375
No, he's not!

01:39:56.440 --> 01:39:58.211
You don't even know him.

01:39:58.276 --> 01:39:59.979
He didn't get Penny pregnant.

01:40:00.044 --> 01:40:01.614
Oh, really? Well, who did?

01:40:03.447 --> 01:40:05.571
I know he didn't.

01:40:06.450 --> 01:40:08.721
- I believe him.
- Because you know him so well.

01:40:08.786 --> 01:40:11.190
Yeah. I do.

01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:14.860
The irony is, he's a lot like you, Dad.

01:40:14.925 --> 01:40:16.529
He is!

01:40:16.594 --> 01:40:19.097
He came from nothing and he knows
the value of hard work.

01:40:19.163 --> 01:40:20.472
Stealing cars?

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.869
If you would just talk to him...

01:40:23.934 --> 01:40:25.004
I can't even <i>look at him!</i>

01:40:31.575 --> 01:40:33.487
I can't even look at him.

01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.160
He took the most precious thing
in the world to me.

01:40:40.217 --> 01:40:42.561
No, he didn't, Dad.

01:40:45.056 --> 01:40:47.263
I'm standing right here.

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.466
Look, I'm going off to school soon.

01:40:53.931 --> 01:40:56.810
And I don't really know what's going on
with you and Mom.

01:40:57.968 --> 01:40:59.405
But I'm really worried

01:40:59.470 --> 01:41:04.249
that when you finally stop
working and lift your eyes...

01:41:06.510 --> 01:41:08.490
nobody's gonna be there.

01:41:11.982 --> 01:41:12.983
You know...

01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:20.669
I thought <i>you</i> hung the moon.

01:41:37.291 --> 01:41:38.736
Dr. Houseman?

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:43.118
Dr. Houseman, I know I'm the last person
you wanna see right now.

01:41:43.198 --> 01:41:46.605
- You don't know anything, son.
- I know you love your daughter.

01:41:48.168 --> 01:41:49.909
And you should.

01:41:51.104 --> 01:41:53.008
She's an amazing girl.

01:41:53.073 --> 01:41:55.576
She had a great role model.

01:41:57.044 --> 01:41:59.214
She just wanted to help me and Penny.

01:41:59.279 --> 01:42:01.555
She never meant to hurt you along the way.

01:42:06.186 --> 01:42:08.689
I just want you to know I'm not
gonna screw up her life

01:42:08.755 --> 01:42:10.758
any more than I have already.

01:42:15.562 --> 01:42:17.399
Here's the money Baby borrowed from you...

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:19.205
every cent.

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:25.974
Thank you for your help with Penny.

01:42:28.008 --> 01:42:30.011
I'll always be grateful to you.

01:42:40.187 --> 01:42:42.963
- I'll drive down Saturday morning.
- Thanks, pal.

01:42:50.497 --> 01:42:52.477
Take care, Johnny.

01:43:09.082 --> 01:43:11.320
I love you, Johnny.

01:43:11.385 --> 01:43:14.056
And I always will.

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:31.576
<i># She's like the wind #</i>

<i># Oh, oh. #</i>

01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:39.768
I finished <i>The Feminine Mystique.</i>

01:45:39.833 --> 01:45:42.036
I ran out of my magazines.

01:45:42.936 --> 01:45:45.006
Anyway, she calls us "Sleeping Beauties,"

01:45:45.071 --> 01:45:47.475
and you know how
I've always loved fairy tales.

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.445
But she says we need to stop
waiting for Prince Charming...

01:45:50.510 --> 01:45:53.748
wake up, live our own lives.
Be creative, you know?

01:45:53.813 --> 01:45:56.055
She sounds exactly like you.

01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:02.056
No.

01:46:02.121 --> 01:46:04.397
I don't know anything, Lisa.

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:08.904
I just read a lot and wanna sound smart.

01:46:10.964 --> 01:46:13.968
But you can't tell other people
how to live their lives.

01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:19.145
You really miss him, don't you?

01:46:23.843 --> 01:46:25.880
Yeah.

01:46:47.500 --> 01:46:51.004
- You ready to order, Dr. Houseman?
- No. I think I'll wait for my family.

01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:52.974
I don't think they're coming, sir.

01:46:53.039 --> 01:46:56.684
Your daughters are having lunch at the lake,
and your wife said she wasn't hungry.

01:46:57.610 --> 01:46:59.547
Oh. Okay.

01:46:59.612 --> 01:47:02.383
Can I recommend the pastrami sandwich, sir?

01:47:02.448 --> 01:47:05.156
It's served on rye toast
with coleslaw and mayo.

01:47:07.053 --> 01:47:09.556
Sure. Sure, that's...

01:47:09.622 --> 01:47:11.397
That... that sounds great.

01:47:22.111 --> 01:47:26.351
All the couples I know,
married longer than five years?

01:47:26.416 --> 01:47:28.919
Maybe once a month.

01:47:28.985 --> 01:47:31.022
In the beginning, Bernie was all over me.

01:47:31.087 --> 01:47:33.958
Then one day, nada. Zip. Nothing.

01:47:34.023 --> 01:47:38.162
I knew he was cheating,
but he denied it up and down.

01:47:38.227 --> 01:47:40.264
Made me think I was crazy.

01:47:40.329 --> 01:47:42.600
I had to hire a private dick
to catch him in the act.

01:47:42.665 --> 01:47:44.636
- Oh.
- Leon would never cheat.

01:47:44.701 --> 01:47:47.472
All he needs are his golf clubs
and a gin and tonic.

01:47:47.537 --> 01:47:49.707
Marjorie. Can I talk to you?

01:47:49.772 --> 01:47:51.743
Uh, Jake, I'm in the middle of a game.

01:47:51.808 --> 01:47:54.050
This is important.

01:47:58.281 --> 01:48:00.056
Excuse me.

01:48:16.399 --> 01:48:19.604
You didn't... you didn't
have to do this, Jake.

01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:21.672
It's not for you. It's for me.

01:48:21.738 --> 01:48:24.375
I have some things I wanna say.

01:48:49.265 --> 01:48:50.767
The summer we met...

01:48:52.268 --> 01:48:55.249
my whole life lay ahead of me.

01:48:57.206 --> 01:48:59.487
I was young and strong...

01:49:00.743 --> 01:49:02.916
so full of ambition.

01:49:04.347 --> 01:49:09.353
And you were the most beautiful
girl at Kellerman's,

01:49:09.418 --> 01:49:12.857
but you were also whip-smart and kind.

01:49:12.922 --> 01:49:14.859
And I wanted to be good enough for you.

01:49:14.924 --> 01:49:16.597
You <i>were</i> good enough for me.

01:49:19.028 --> 01:49:21.265
You're a good man, Jake.

01:49:21.330 --> 01:49:23.668
You're a wonderful father.

01:49:23.733 --> 01:49:26.104
We made a good team together.

01:49:26.169 --> 01:49:29.607
Somewhere along the way,
we lost track of each other.

01:49:29.672 --> 01:49:32.881
Our job as parents is done.

01:49:34.243 --> 01:49:35.552
And I...

01:49:37.847 --> 01:49:40.051
I want more.

01:49:40.116 --> 01:49:43.421
I know, and I'm sorry.

01:49:43.486 --> 01:49:46.296
I've been so distant.

01:49:48.391 --> 01:49:49.594
And you're right.

01:49:49.659 --> 01:49:53.064
We were all over each other way back when.

01:49:53.129 --> 01:49:58.269
And then we got busy with the demands
of building a career and family,

01:49:58.334 --> 01:50:02.112
and once a week turns into
once a month and...

01:50:06.242 --> 01:50:09.480
I stopped trying. I didn't wanna be rejected.

01:50:09.545 --> 01:50:11.821
- I wouldn't have.
- I know that now.

01:50:13.549 --> 01:50:16.894
I'm still that same neighborhood kid who...

01:50:18.321 --> 01:50:22.627
would give anything
to be with someone like you.

01:50:22.692 --> 01:50:26.097
And I know things have to change.

01:50:26.162 --> 01:50:27.865
I just want that chance.

01:50:27.930 --> 01:50:30.934
This summer's been a wake-up call for me.

01:50:33.569 --> 01:50:36.744
I can't lose you, Marjorie. I can't.

01:51:33.111 --> 01:51:35.315
What's this?

01:51:35.380 --> 01:51:38.252
I thought it was time for you
to have a grown-up dress.

01:51:46.592 --> 01:51:49.095
Thanks for the new dress, Mom.

01:51:49.161 --> 01:51:51.573
It looks beautiful on you.

01:51:56.835 --> 01:51:58.747
I'm sorry about your dad.

01:51:59.972 --> 01:52:04.011
He loves you in the kind of way
that makes people act crazy.

01:52:05.177 --> 01:52:09.888
He's not ready for you to grow up,
but he doesn't have a choice.

01:52:13.452 --> 01:52:16.092
You're not the same girl
you were three weeks ago.

01:52:18.056 --> 01:52:22.171
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- No, don't be. Don't be.

01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:29.110
You didn't commit a crime. You fell in love.

01:52:31.270 --> 01:52:33.750
It happens to the best of us.

01:52:40.993 --> 01:52:42.229
Ladies and gents,

01:52:42.294 --> 01:52:44.998
take advantage of our early-bird special

01:52:45.063 --> 01:52:49.702
and register for summer of '64
before you leave tomorrow.

01:52:50.502 --> 01:52:53.740
I always get emotional
on the last night of the season.

01:52:53.805 --> 01:52:56.610
What can I say? I love you all.

01:52:56.675 --> 01:52:59.446
- You've been my extended family...
- Honey... please put the book away.

01:52:59.511 --> 01:53:01.314
It's... it's a party.

01:53:02.581 --> 01:53:04.685
Doesn't Baby look beautiful tonight?

01:53:04.750 --> 01:53:08.856
She's going to college, Marjorie.
She wants to be called Frances.

01:53:08.921 --> 01:53:12.459
And now, in keeping
with Kellerman's tradition,

01:53:12.524 --> 01:53:14.628
our end-of-summer song.

01:53:18.617 --> 01:53:22.823
<i># Kellerman's, we come together #</i>

01:53:22.888 --> 01:53:26.927
<i># Singing all as one #</i>

01:53:26.992 --> 01:53:31.031
<i># We have shared another season's #</i>

01:53:31.096 --> 01:53:34.902
<i># Talent, play, and fun #</i>

01:53:34.967 --> 01:53:39.106
<i># Summer days will soon be over #</i>

01:53:39.171 --> 01:53:43.410
<i># Soon the autumn starts #</i>

01:53:43.475 --> 01:53:47.514
<i># And tonight the memories whisper #</i>

01:53:47.579 --> 01:53:51.385
<i># Softly in our hearts #</i>

01:53:51.450 --> 01:53:55.622
<i># Join hands and hearts and voices #</i>

01:53:55.687 --> 01:53:58.926
<i># Voices, hearts, and hands #</i>

01:53:58.991 --> 01:54:03.669
<i># At Kellerman's, the friendships last long#</i>

01:54:03.749 --> 01:54:07.234
<i># As the mountains stand #</i>

01:54:07.299 --> 01:54:09.703
<i># Join hands and hearts and voices #</i>

01:54:09.768 --> 01:54:12.271
Robbie. Robbie!

01:54:12.337 --> 01:54:15.542
<i># Voices, hearts, and hands #</i>

01:54:15.607 --> 01:54:17.811
Good luck at Harvard, son.

01:54:17.876 --> 01:54:20.213
Thank you, Dr. Houseman.

01:54:20.278 --> 01:54:22.588
It's been a real honor
serving you and your family.

01:54:23.715 --> 01:54:27.424
And thanks for your help
with the, uh, Penny situation.

01:54:29.054 --> 01:54:31.224
"The Penny situation"?

01:54:32.289 --> 01:54:34.828
Yeah. I thought Penny told you.

01:54:34.893 --> 01:54:38.068
Girl like that, bound to get
into trouble sometime, huh?

01:54:43.301 --> 01:54:45.973
Harvard or not, you're gonna
make a lousy doctor,

01:54:46.038 --> 01:54:47.441
because you have no integrity.

01:54:47.506 --> 01:54:49.076
Let me tell you what happens next...

01:54:49.141 --> 01:54:51.211
you're gonna apologize to Penny,

01:54:51.276 --> 01:54:52.778
and then you're gonna pay her back

01:54:52.844 --> 01:54:55.983
every cent that she spent
trying to fix your carelessness.

01:54:56.048 --> 01:54:58.986
If you decide not to, I know the heads
of every major hospital in New England.

01:54:59.051 --> 01:55:00.928
I'll be happy to give them a call.

01:55:17.169 --> 01:55:18.271
Hey, everybody.

01:55:18.336 --> 01:55:21.642
Um, my friend taught me
how to play the ukulele.

01:55:21.707 --> 01:55:23.477
I'm still a bit rusty.

01:55:23.542 --> 01:55:26.455
Um... Marco?

01:55:27.913 --> 01:55:29.216
Will you join me?

01:55:46.497 --> 01:55:47.534
Here goes.

01:55:56.108 --> 01:56:00.714
<i># Well, it ain't no use
to sit and wonder why, babe #</i>

01:56:01.579 --> 01:56:04.885
<i># Even if you don't know by now #</i>

01:56:04.950 --> 01:56:09.624
<i># And it ain't no use
to sit and wonder why, babe #</i>

01:56:10.689 --> 01:56:13.192
<i># It'll never do, somehow #</i>

01:56:13.258 --> 01:56:18.198
<i># When your rooster crows
at the break of dawn #</i>

01:56:18.263 --> 01:56:22.869
<i># Look out your window and I'll be gone #</i>

01:56:22.934 --> 01:56:27.074
<i># You're the reason I'm a-travelin' on #</i>

01:56:27.139 --> 01:56:31.078
<i># But don't think twice, it's all right #</i>

01:56:31.143 --> 01:56:35.682
<i># And it ain't no use
in turnin' on your light, babe #</i>

01:56:35.747 --> 01:56:39.718
<i># The light I never knowed #</i>

01:56:39.785 --> 01:56:43.857
<i># And it ain't no use
in turnin' on your light, babe #</i>

01:56:43.922 --> 01:56:48.195
<i># I'm on the dark side of the road #</i>

01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:53.100
<i># But I wish there was something
you would do or say #</i>

01:56:53.165 --> 01:56:57.671
<i># To try and make me
change my mind and stay #</i>

01:56:57.736 --> 01:57:01.908
<i># But we never did too much talkin' anyway #</i>

01:57:01.973 --> 01:57:06.113
<i># But don't think twice, it's all right #</i>

01:57:06.178 --> 01:57:07.848
<i># Ooh #</i>

01:57:07.913 --> 01:57:10.917
We've seen it all, haven't we, Tito?

01:57:11.282 --> 01:57:14.521
But not changes like these.

01:57:14.586 --> 01:57:19.392
<i># So, it ain't no use
in callin' out my name, boy #</i>

01:57:19.457 --> 01:57:22.562
<i># Like you've never done before #</i>

01:57:22.627 --> 01:57:28.301
<i># And it ain't no use
in callin' out my name, boy #</i>

01:57:28.366 --> 01:57:31.571
<i># I can't hear you anymore #</i>

01:57:31.636 --> 01:57:34.608
<i># I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' #</i>

01:57:34.673 --> 01:57:36.710
<i># Walkin' down the road #</i>

01:57:36.775 --> 01:57:41.081
<i># I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told #</i>

01:57:41.146 --> 01:57:42.916
- <i># I gave her my heart #</i>
- <i># Ooh #</i>

01:57:42.981 --> 01:57:45.152
- <i># But she wanted my soul #</i>
- <i># Ooh #</i>

01:57:45.217 --> 01:57:48.889
<i># But don't think twice, it's all right #</i>

01:57:48.954 --> 01:57:52.159
You're right, boss. Everything is changing.

01:57:52.224 --> 01:57:54.295
But maybe that's a good thing.

01:57:55.527 --> 01:57:58.331
<i># Ooh #</i>

01:57:58.396 --> 01:58:01.134
<i># Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh #</i>

01:58:01.199 --> 01:58:05.375
<i># Ooh, ooh, ooh. #</i>

01:58:13.645 --> 01:58:14.948
I'm always moved,

01:58:15.013 --> 01:58:18.251
saying goodbye to my guests
at the end of the summer.

01:58:18.316 --> 01:58:22.822
But this summer,
my heart is full to bursting.

01:58:22.888 --> 01:58:25.425
This was a summer I'll always remember.

01:58:25.490 --> 01:58:30.130
A summer of family, a summer of friendship,

01:58:30.195 --> 01:58:31.998
- a summer of...
- Of love.

01:58:50.548 --> 01:58:53.051
Nobody puts Baby in a corner.

01:58:54.686 --> 01:58:55.721
Come on.

01:59:19.544 --> 01:59:21.956
If you don't mind,
this'll just take a second.

01:59:23.748 --> 01:59:25.284
Come on.

01:59:31.690 --> 01:59:34.461
Sorry for the disruption, folks.

01:59:34.526 --> 01:59:36.897
This was a hell of a summer for me.

01:59:36.962 --> 01:59:40.500
I met someone who taught me a lot about life,

01:59:40.565 --> 01:59:42.669
about the kind of person I wanna be,

01:59:42.734 --> 01:59:46.606
the kind of man I wanna be.

01:59:46.671 --> 01:59:50.016
The kind of man who's not afraid
to tell the truth.

01:59:54.045 --> 01:59:56.821
I had the time of my life
with you this summer.

01:59:58.083 --> 02:00:00.987
I don't know what happens to us from here.

02:00:01.052 --> 02:00:03.328
I do know one thing...

02:00:04.556 --> 02:00:05.728
I love you.

02:00:07.659 --> 02:00:11.903
And I'm hoping you'll be willing to dance
with me one more time.

02:00:13.598 --> 02:00:15.268
Of course.

02:00:38.690 --> 02:00:41.093
<i># Now I #</i>

02:00:41.159 --> 02:00:45.365
<i># Had the time of my life #</i>

02:00:45.430 --> 02:00:49.235
<i># No, I've never felt like this before #</i>

02:00:49.300 --> 02:00:54.272
<i># Yes, I swear it's the truth #</i>

02:00:54.339 --> 02:00:56.443
<i># And I owe it all to you #</i>

02:00:56.508 --> 02:01:02.816
<i># 'Cause I had the time of my life #</i>

02:01:02.881 --> 02:01:06.488
<i># And I owe it all to you #</i>

02:01:14.192 --> 02:01:15.996
<i># I've been waiting for so long #</i>

02:01:16.061 --> 02:01:20.203
<i># Now I've finally found
someone to stand by me #</i>

02:01:22.467 --> 02:01:24.904
<i># We saw the writing on the wall #</i>

02:01:24.969 --> 02:01:30.078
<i># As we felt this magical fantasy #</i>

02:01:31.643 --> 02:01:34.114
<i># Now with passion in our eyes #</i>

02:01:34.179 --> 02:01:35.915
- <i># There's no way #</i>
- Did you know she could do that?

02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:37.459
- <i># We could disguise it secretly #</i>
- No.

02:01:40.518 --> 02:01:42.589
<i># So we take each other's hand #</i>

02:01:42.654 --> 02:01:48.528
<i># 'Cause we seem to understand the urgency #</i>

02:01:48.593 --> 02:01:50.497
<i># Just remember #</i>

02:01:50.562 --> 02:01:53.733
<i># You're the one thing #</i>

02:01:53.798 --> 02:01:58.804
<i># I can't get enough of #</i>

02:01:58.870 --> 02:02:03.876
<i># So I'll tell you something #</i>

02:02:03.942 --> 02:02:08.014

02:02:08.079 --> 02:02:12.952

02:02:13.017 --> 02:02:17.590

<i># And I owe it all to you #</i>

02:02:28.833 --> 02:02:30.437
<i># Hey, Baby #</i>

02:02:33.505 --> 02:02:35.442
<i># With my body and soul #</i>

02:02:35.507 --> 02:02:40.183
<i># I want you more than you'll ever know #</i>

02:02:41.913 --> 02:02:44.017
<i># So we'll just let it go #</i>

02:02:44.082 --> 02:02:48.053
<i># Don't be afraid to lose control #</i>

02:02:48.119 --> 02:02:50.223
<i># Oh, no #</i>

02:02:50.788 --> 02:02:53.059
<i># Yes, I know what's on your mind #</i>

02:02:53.124 --> 02:02:57.063
<i># When you say, "Stay with me tonight" #</i>

02:02:57.128 --> 02:02:58.965
<i># Stay with me #</i>

02:02:59.030 --> 02:03:01.301

02:03:56.054 --> 02:03:57.924
You looked great out there tonight.

02:03:57.989 --> 02:04:00.093
Thanks, Daddy.

02:04:02.961 --> 02:04:07.434
When I'm wrong, I say I'm wrong,
and I was wrong about you.

02:04:07.999 --> 02:04:10.536
I hope you'll accept my apology.

02:04:10.601 --> 02:04:13.506
Of course. Thank you, sir.

Baby.

02:06:20.164 --> 02:06:21.768
Hi.

02:06:22.767 --> 02:06:24.178
Hey.

02:06:31.376 --> 02:06:33.754
They didn't tell me you were gonna be here.

02:06:39.450 --> 02:06:44.624
The show was amazing,
especially the choreography.

02:06:45.689 --> 02:06:48.328
It was inspired by your book.

02:06:48.893 --> 02:06:51.431
It's a great story, Frances.

02:06:52.496 --> 02:06:54.434
Thanks, Johnny.

02:06:57.034 --> 02:06:59.810
Never thought I'd have
a career on Broadway...

02:07:01.205 --> 02:07:02.542
until I met you.

02:07:03.607 --> 02:07:05.747
You were so fearless.

02:07:07.311 --> 02:07:09.018
You made me feel like I could do anything.

02:07:10.714 --> 02:07:12.786
That summer...

02:07:13.351 --> 02:07:15.456
changed everything for me.

02:07:17.522 --> 02:07:19.859
I stopped being "the baby."

02:07:19.924 --> 02:07:21.665
Looks that way.

02:07:23.728 --> 02:07:26.299
Mommy! Mommy!

02:07:27.865 --> 02:07:30.203
Come here. Hi.

02:07:30.268 --> 02:07:32.405
We were waiting outside, but I'm hungry.

02:07:32.470 --> 02:07:34.140
Okay, I'm sorry.

02:07:34.205 --> 02:07:37.243
- Who's this?
- This is Johnny Castle.

02:07:37.308 --> 02:07:39.212
He choreographed the show I just saw.

02:07:39.277 --> 02:07:41.481
- You're a dancer?
- Yes, ma'am.

02:07:41.546 --> 02:07:44.250
- My mommy dances.
- Not really.

02:07:44.315 --> 02:07:47.253
I take a salsa class once a week at the JCC.

02:07:47.318 --> 02:07:48.654
Oh, you do?

02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:50.358
Sorry. She disappeared on me.

02:07:52.990 --> 02:07:54.260
You must be Johnny Castle.

02:07:54.325 --> 02:07:56.462
This is my husband, Charlie.

02:07:56.527 --> 02:07:58.297
- We'll meet you guys outside.
- Okay.

02:07:58.362 --> 02:08:00.233
Very nice to meet you. Come on, Annie.

02:08:00.298 --> 02:08:01.333
I'll be right out.

02:08:14.212 --> 02:08:16.818
It was really great to see you again.

02:08:19.016 --> 02:08:20.359
You too.

02:08:28.025 --> 02:08:29.026
Hey.

02:08:34.131 --> 02:08:35.971
Keep on dancing.

02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:39.907
You too, Johnny.
