Roger, you've been mixing
that eggnog for an hour.

00:39.105 --> 00:40.916
Just pour it in
your pimp cup and drink it!

00:41.082 --> 00:42.458
It's almost ready.

00:42.583 --> 00:44.476
Just need to do the final test.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.397 --> 01:05.397
Perfect.

01:06.549 --> 01:08.026
Look at this!

01:08.192 --> 01:11.229
Father Donovan's putting on
a Christmas play at the mall!

01:11.354 --> 01:13.064
They're doing
the entire life of Jesus...

01:13.189 --> 01:15.534
From baby Jesus
to awkward teenager Jesus

01:15.659 --> 01:17.035
with a wispy Christache,

01:17.160 --> 01:18.970
to the mature
and ready-to-suffer Jesus

01:19.095 --> 01:20.122
we all know and love.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.498
Are you going to audition?

01:21.665 --> 01:23.642
Audition?

01:23.767 --> 01:26.044
Francine, I'm the most devout
member of the church.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.747
Obviously, I'm doing the
most important role:

01:28.872 --> 01:30.132
Christ at the crucifixion.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.683
When it comes to Christianity,

01:31.808 --> 01:33.343
that's pretty much your money shot.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.653
Christianity...

01:34.778 --> 01:37.122
My favorite deadbeat Dad story.

01:37.247 --> 01:40.592
Check it... God fathers this kid
and then disappears.

01:40.717 --> 01:42.394
And then,
when the kid becomes famous,

01:42.519 --> 01:44.438
God wants him to come live with him.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.865
Exact same thing happened to Shaq.

01:46.990 --> 01:48.433
He did a rap about it called,

01:48.558 --> 01:51.069
"my biological didn't bother."

01:51.194 --> 01:53.505
My religion is the very
foundation of who I am

01:53.630 --> 01:56.080
and I won't have you
disrespecting it!

01:59.703 --> 02:02.113
You... you have a-a pimple coming in

02:02.238 --> 02:03.715
under the skin on your nose.

02:03.840 --> 02:05.500
I would say it's got two weeks

02:05.625 --> 02:06.935
before it reaches its apex.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.394
You better gear up.

02:11.839 --> 02:13.475
Is everything okay, Jeff?

02:13.600 --> 02:16.244
You cried a lot more than usual
during sex this morning.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.880
Sorry, babe, I have a lot on my mind.

02:19.005 --> 02:21.049
I've been thinking a lot and...

02:21.174 --> 02:22.384
I think we should have a baby.

02:22.509 --> 02:23.685
What?

02:23.851 --> 02:26.438
Yeah, we have so much love to give.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.341
Plus, sometimes I feel broken inside

02:29.466 --> 02:31.109
and having a baby fixes everything.

02:31.275 --> 02:32.978
Jeff, I don't want to have kids.

02:33.103 --> 02:34.988
I have no maternal instincts.

02:35.154 --> 02:36.648
I only have animal instincts...

02:36.773 --> 02:37.882
Eating, pooping,

02:38.007 --> 02:39.857
lying down before it rains.

02:52.838 --> 02:54.232
Morning, Father.

02:54.357 --> 02:56.401
I know you want me to
portray Jesus on the cross,

02:56.526 --> 02:58.153
and I hereby officially accept.

02:58.278 --> 03:01.097
Oh, Stan,
you can't play Jesus.

03:01.263 --> 03:03.558
What do you mean? I'm the most
devout member of your flock.

03:03.724 --> 03:07.145
Portraying Jesus has nothing
to do with religious devotion.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.546
It's all about the abs.

03:08.671 --> 03:09.514
What?!

03:09.639 --> 03:10.582
You're too fat.

03:10.707 --> 03:11.850
Look at any crucifix.

03:11.975 --> 03:13.918
Jesus is always shredded.

03:14.043 --> 03:15.570
I'm a perfect Jesus!
Look!

03:18.431 --> 03:20.275
Well, that's just great!

03:20.400 --> 03:21.676
Now what am I supposed to burn

03:21.801 --> 03:23.495
on my ethnic neighbor's lawn?

03:24.637 --> 03:27.148
Look, you can't be Jesus.

03:27.273 --> 03:29.041
But I got something even better.

03:30.668 --> 03:31.653
Fireman Jesus?

03:31.778 --> 03:33.455
No. Santa Claus.

03:33.580 --> 03:34.456
Aw...

03:34.581 --> 03:36.124
Come on.

03:36.249 --> 03:38.677
He's jolly, he employs
midgets, he's real.

03:38.802 --> 03:40.278
Look, these Bratz dolls...

03:40.403 --> 03:43.748
Last year he gave
them to me, for free.

03:43.873 --> 03:44.716
Okay.

03:44.841 --> 03:46.918
Attaboy.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.213
Hard to believe this is
the suit Earl died in.

03:58.779 --> 04:00.824
Um... wha...
What is that?

04:00.990 --> 04:01.966
Don't be mad.

04:02.091 --> 04:04.436
It's just...
I wanted a kid so bad,

04:04.561 --> 04:07.706
and I saw this orphanage and...

04:07.831 --> 04:10.308
Hayley, meet our son.

04:10.433 --> 04:13.336
I named him after my favorite
character in literature, Nemo...

04:13.837 --> 04:16.964
From the novelization of
the film <i>Finding Nemo.</i>

04:17.130 --> 04:19.551
You adopted a child
without asking me?!

04:19.676 --> 04:21.619
I have grandchildren?!

04:21.744 --> 04:23.321
Oh, my God, I can't believe it!

04:23.446 --> 04:25.223
I thought my only chance was if Steve

04:25.348 --> 04:27.216
got raped by a confused lesbian!

04:29.168 --> 04:30.228
This is crazy!

04:30.353 --> 04:32.856
Jeff, take that kid back right now!

04:33.022 --> 04:35.617
No! I want a son to
carry on my legacy...

04:35.742 --> 04:37.569
My Subaru legacy.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.020
Adoption takes years.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.156
How did you get a kid so fast?

04:41.322 --> 04:43.525
I don't know...
End-of-month clearance?

04:43.650 --> 04:45.952
They seemed real happy
to get rid of him.

04:46.118 --> 04:48.530
Maybe there's something
wrong with him.

04:48.655 --> 04:49.964
Aw, look, babe.

04:50.089 --> 04:51.166
He's smiling at you.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.459
Well, tell him to stop.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.493
Leave me alone, baby!

04:58.298 --> 05:00.809
You're my baby!

05:00.934 --> 05:03.912
You're my baby,
and I love you so much!

05:04.037 --> 05:05.714
Oh, God!

05:08.258 --> 05:09.117
Who's that?

05:09.242 --> 05:10.251
We're grandparents!

05:10.376 --> 05:13.078
Steve was raped
by a confused lesbian?

05:15.856 --> 05:17.959
Okay, what do you want, little boy?

05:18.084 --> 05:20.195
Um, let me think about it.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.629
Hey, you're not a child.

05:21.754 --> 05:22.697
Don't worry about it.

05:22.822 --> 05:23.865
You can't be here.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.767
Come on, man, I waited in line.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.335
Let me just sit here for a minute.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.203
Get off me!

05:28.428 --> 05:30.004
No, I'm almost done, man.

05:30.129 --> 05:31.172
Almost done with what?

05:31.297 --> 05:32.531
Don't worry about it.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.278
The Christmas play.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.153
I want to see this Jesus.

05:41.465 --> 05:42.550
Good lord!

05:42.716 --> 05:44.569
♪ ♪

05:44.694 --> 05:45.929
Yes, my son?

05:46.095 --> 05:48.306
Roger!
What are you doing?!

05:48.431 --> 05:51.476
Well, you were talking so much
about this, it sounded like fun.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.521
It's not, but it was a good
excuse to work on my abs.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.273
And my savior bulge.

05:57.439 --> 05:58.900
This is sacrilege!

05:59.025 --> 06:00.685
You have no respect
for this religion!

06:00.810 --> 06:01.953
Hey, could you take it down a notch?

06:02.078 --> 06:02.987
You're ruining my buzz.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.030
You're drunk?!

06:04.196 --> 06:05.949
Hell yeah, man.

06:06.115 --> 06:06.616
That's it!

06:16.743 --> 06:18.393
You're ugly.

06:26.569 --> 06:28.546
Oh, Hayley, stop!

06:28.671 --> 06:30.048
Yo bitch-crying is going to be

06:30.173 --> 06:31.916
in the background
of this entire video.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.786
But I love him so much!

06:34.911 --> 06:36.988
Oh, my God, what happened to you?

06:37.113 --> 06:40.992
I sat next to Courtney love
on the bus and she sneezed.

06:41.117 --> 06:42.610
Uh... guys?

06:42.776 --> 06:44.429
... when a deranged mall Santa

06:44.554 --> 06:47.323
suddenly attacked the church
volunteer portraying Jesus.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.450
It's not what it looks like!

06:49.575 --> 06:50.819
I was defending Christmas!

06:50.944 --> 06:52.854
I was defending Jesus!

06:52.979 --> 06:54.055
... Santa continued the assault

06:54.180 --> 06:56.124
while shouting anti-jesuslurs.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.959
You don't deserve
to be on that cross,

06:58.084 --> 07:00.254
you lazy, wine-loving bisexual!

07:07.577 --> 07:09.220
Are you watching this?

07:09.386 --> 07:12.182
I wasn't slurring Jesus,
I was talking about Roger!

07:12.348 --> 07:15.777
This just in: The assailant
has now been identified as...

07:15.902 --> 07:17.045
Oh, for God's sake...

07:17.170 --> 07:19.272
<i>Stan Smith of Langley falls.</i>

07:20.573 --> 07:21.850
Yello?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.468
Dad, it's Father Donovan.

07:23.593 --> 07:25.360
He sounds punitive.

07:28.197 --> 07:29.974
Look, Stan, I actually
think what you did

07:30.099 --> 07:32.310
was really, really funny.

07:32.435 --> 07:35.547
But Christian leaders around
the world saw you on TV,

07:35.672 --> 07:38.816
and they've been chewing
my ass off nonstop.

07:38.941 --> 07:42.270
I'm sorry, Stan, but I'm going
to have to kick you out.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.172
I can't go to your church anymore?

07:44.338 --> 07:47.475
No, Stan, you're kicked out
of Christianity.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.677
You can't go into any church.

07:49.843 --> 07:51.971
No! Well, there must be some way
to get back in!

07:52.137 --> 07:54.883
Well, there are three,
but they're tough:

07:55.008 --> 07:57.085
You'd have to find the holy grail

07:57.210 --> 07:59.287
or kill the antichrist

07:59.412 --> 08:02.056
or donate ten million
dollars to charity...

08:02.181 --> 08:04.282
That's how Jared from
subway got back in.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.244
I can't do any of those things!

08:06.369 --> 08:08.580
I'm sorry, Stan,
there's nothing I can do.

08:08.705 --> 08:10.848
You are officially excommunicated.

08:10.973 --> 08:12.541
Turn in your badge.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.841
Uh, wait, Stan!

08:19.966 --> 08:21.242
Should I grow a mustache?

08:21.367 --> 08:24.403
What, uh... what do hookers like?

08:31.927 --> 08:33.186
That punch, right there.

08:33.311 --> 08:35.188
That's the punch where
everything went black

08:35.313 --> 08:38.357
and I was finally
able to achieve orgasm.

08:38.482 --> 08:40.217
Oh...

08:43.054 --> 08:44.274
I've been excommunicated.

08:44.773 --> 08:45.483
What?!

08:45.649 --> 08:47.768
A man without his religion is...

08:47.893 --> 08:49.362
Nothing.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.840
Dad, if religion's
so important to you,

08:53.965 --> 08:55.118
why don't you just find another one?

08:55.284 --> 08:57.287
You mean change religions?

08:57.453 --> 09:00.097
Sure, people do it all the time.

09:00.222 --> 09:02.199
Muhammad Ali changed religions

09:02.324 --> 09:04.169
and became Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

09:04.459 --> 09:07.271
I don't want another
religion, I want my religion.

09:07.396 --> 09:10.040
I know, honey, but the thing is,

09:10.165 --> 09:13.344
you already kind of
screwed yourself there.

09:15.137 --> 09:18.148
Good-bye, amusing
religious Tchotchkes.

09:18.273 --> 09:20.784
I'll especially miss you,
Christ-in-the-box.

09:29.384 --> 09:30.327
Hello, buddy.

09:30.452 --> 09:33.230
You're sad for grandpa, too.

09:33.355 --> 09:34.622
Come here, good boy!

09:43.582 --> 09:45.058
He's the antichrist!

09:45.183 --> 09:46.910
Stan, you need to cheer up.

09:47.035 --> 09:48.095
Here, have some caramel corn.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.422
I made it just for you.

09:51.156 --> 09:54.001
No, Trevor, we didn't
re-gift your popcorn!

09:54.126 --> 09:56.370
It was just here yesterday...
I don't know where it went.

09:56.495 --> 09:57.537
You know what?

09:57.662 --> 09:59.406
You guys are worse than Connor!

10:00.641 --> 10:01.975
Forget the caramel corn.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.377
This is fantastic!

10:03.502 --> 10:05.045
I can become a Christian again!

10:05.170 --> 10:07.649
All I have to do is
murder my grandson!

10:15.330 --> 10:17.106
It says six-six-six.

10:17.231 --> 10:18.493
He's the antichrist!

10:18.767 --> 10:20.460
You have to be absolutely positive

10:20.585 --> 10:23.230
the toddler is the antichrist
before you kill it.

10:23.355 --> 10:25.583
Boy, I have learned
that the hard way.

10:25.957 --> 10:28.001
We could go to the orphanage,
check his files.

10:28.126 --> 10:29.786
Maybe they'll tell us
where he came from.

10:29.911 --> 10:32.889
That was the worst
caroling I've ever done.

10:33.014 --> 10:34.926
But some of my best tagging.

10:37.886 --> 10:39.429
Jeff, I need you to
take us to the orphanage

10:39.554 --> 10:41.064
where you got Nemo.

10:41.189 --> 10:43.518
I'm trying to prove he's the
antichrist, so I can kill him.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.770
Okay.

10:46.061 --> 10:48.572
While you're there,
give the cutest one this.

10:48.697 --> 10:50.231
And give the ugliest one this.

10:51.716 --> 10:52.659
You're coming with us, Roger.

10:52.784 --> 10:53.894
You got me into this mess,

10:54.019 --> 10:55.512
you're gonna help get me out of it.

10:55.637 --> 10:58.283
If I'm to go anywhere, I need to...

10:58.449 --> 10:59.683
How do I put this?

10:59.808 --> 11:02.662
Wipe. Better.

11:05.447 --> 11:09.092
Yep, the whole place went up
in flames last Friday.

11:09.217 --> 11:11.962
The day after Jeff adopted Nemo.

11:14.356 --> 11:17.134
And the day before I had
my cholesterol checked.

11:17.259 --> 11:18.928
My LDL was high.

11:19.053 --> 11:22.013
My HDL was also high,
but that's good.

11:23.465 --> 11:26.183
Split up. Look for anything that
can tell us more about Nemo.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.197
Stan, meet me out front!

11:47.322 --> 11:49.417
I found something so important
it's crazy!

12:16.217 --> 12:17.644
Father Donovan!

12:17.769 --> 12:19.629
I can't feel my legs.

12:19.754 --> 12:21.655
Are they okay?

12:24.142 --> 12:25.385
They're fine, you're good.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.420
You were right, Stan.

12:27.545 --> 12:30.624
Nemo is the son of Satan,
born of a jackal.

12:36.254 --> 12:39.733
Oh, my God, Nemo!

12:39.858 --> 12:42.068
It's "omen" spelled backwards!

12:42.193 --> 12:43.503
He is the antichrist!

12:46.665 --> 12:49.276
But... you picked the name "Nemo."

12:49.401 --> 12:50.853
That... that doesn't make any sense.

12:51.019 --> 12:52.979
Nemo will find his way

12:53.104 --> 12:55.148
to political power and destroy
the world.

12:55.273 --> 12:59.119
You must get the sacred daggers
of Tel Megiddo from the Vatican.

12:59.244 --> 13:01.989
Only they can kill the son of Satan.

13:02.213 --> 13:03.256
Are you sure?

13:03.381 --> 13:06.409
Yes. I read it on Wikipedia.

13:06.534 --> 13:08.912
I also read that,
before making it big,

13:09.037 --> 13:11.748
Jon Bon Jovi toiled in
a women's shoe store

13:11.873 --> 13:16.653
and fronted a band called John
Bon Jovi and the wild ones.

13:16.778 --> 13:18.588
Father Donovan!

13:18.713 --> 13:20.557
We have to get to the Vatican

13:20.682 --> 13:22.893
and make sure he didn't die in vain.

13:23.018 --> 13:27.014
Before joining Bon Jovi in 1983,

13:27.180 --> 13:31.051
drummer Tico Torres toured
with a variety of performers,

13:31.176 --> 13:36.497
including Chuck Berry
and Kenny... Loggins.

13:40.001 --> 13:41.779
Come on!

13:44.531 --> 13:45.450
Steve!

13:45.724 --> 13:48.568
Hey, Dad.
So I went to Dr. Smid,

13:48.693 --> 13:51.304
and he confirmed that my vision
is getting worse.

13:51.429 --> 13:53.640
It had plateaued at seven
diopters, but now...

13:53.765 --> 13:56.176
Nemo is the antichrist!

13:56.301 --> 13:59.112
But now it looks like
it's at nine diop...

13:59.237 --> 14:01.948
We're flying to the Vatican to
get sacred daggers to kill him.

14:02.073 --> 14:05.385
Keep an eye on that kid,
and be careful.

14:05.510 --> 14:08.054
Nemo! Oh, I didn't know you were...

14:11.850 --> 14:16.189
I live to serve thee, oh,
Prince of the Sulphury void.

14:16.488 --> 14:18.932
Hey, Steve, did I
leave my swim trunks...

14:19.057 --> 14:21.892
I'll come back later!

14:27.282 --> 14:30.928
We have to find the daggers of
Tel Meggido so we can kill Nemo.

14:31.053 --> 14:34.865
Can we go?
I'm thirsty.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.851
I read that most of
the ancient artifacts

14:36.976 --> 14:38.669
are down in the catacombs.
We have to...

14:38.794 --> 14:40.296
You a-no enter.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.242
Damn it, this is my only chance
to be a Christian again!

14:45.367 --> 14:47.962
Roger, you have to go in there
and get the daggers for me.

14:48.087 --> 14:49.797
But I don't wanna.

14:49.922 --> 14:51.866
Hey! You know how you like to do
different characters?

14:51.991 --> 14:53.601
Well, why don't you try y one

14:53.726 --> 14:54.977
who's really excited about
helping me?

14:55.194 --> 14:58.272
You mean a persona that's
on board and enthusiastic?

14:58.397 --> 15:00.307
You want Roland Chang.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.010
Super positive Asian.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.070
Let's go!

15:04.236 --> 15:06.597
This is the most
important thing ever!

15:06.722 --> 15:08.890
You wait here, Jeff and
I will get the daggers!

15:10.859 --> 15:13.788
Enjoy-a your visit.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.998
How good are meatballs?

15:20.369 --> 15:22.413
Okay, these are the catacombs.

15:22.538 --> 15:25.416
Look for anything that could
be seven sacred daggers.

15:25.541 --> 15:26.901
Or any empty boxes.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.176
My friend Forrest is moving
and he needs boxes.

15:43.775 --> 15:46.036
Jeff, you don't do coke, do you?

15:46.161 --> 15:47.872
Cool. Me neither.

15:47.997 --> 15:50.533
Look out!

15:54.420 --> 15:55.871
Jeff!

15:56.037 --> 15:58.457
What?

16:04.546 --> 16:06.056
Oh, good, you're all here.

16:06.181 --> 16:07.725
I hate to break it to you,

16:07.850 --> 16:10.219
but you have a moisture
problem in your vents.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.894
Now, I can give you an estimate
for the work based on... hiyaah!

16:19.194 --> 16:22.815
Come on, go, go, go, we got the daggers,
Jeff died, run, run, run!

16:23.082 --> 16:25.926
<i>Mene mene tekel.</i>
<i>Satana satana.</i>

16:26.051 --> 16:28.154
Mom, Steve's acting weird again.

16:28.387 --> 16:31.198
Steve, stop babbling
at your sister in Aramaic.

16:31.323 --> 16:33.159
It's a dead language.

16:36.512 --> 16:38.998
Stan? Where have you been?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.750
Wha... didn't you get my message?

16:40.916 --> 16:42.276
What message?

16:42.401 --> 16:43.502
<i>Mene mene tekel.</i>

16:43.668 --> 16:45.087
Steve!

16:45.304 --> 16:47.448
Don't bother.
He's been a pill all day.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.083
What's going on, Dad?

16:49.208 --> 16:51.919
Nemo is the antichrist.
He killed Father Donovan,

16:52.044 --> 16:54.188
and now we have to
stab him with sacred daggers.

16:54.313 --> 16:55.431
Oh, and Jeff died.

16:55.597 --> 16:56.641
Jeff is dead?!

16:59.935 --> 17:02.563
Nemo turned Steve into
an apostate of Satan!

17:02.729 --> 17:04.765
He's probably just hungry.

17:04.890 --> 17:07.501
Steve, I just did a big
trader Joe's run.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.803
Pour yourself some unsweetened
cherry juice,

17:09.928 --> 17:13.707
maybe have it with some
sunflower paste on a flax crisp.

17:13.832 --> 17:16.977
There's also a scallop Shu Mai
that tastes like nothing

17:17.102 --> 17:20.122
and a mushroom flatbread pizza
that smells like nut sack.

17:23.583 --> 17:24.542
Oh, my God!

17:26.845 --> 17:29.356
See? Nemo's the son of Satan.
We have to destroy him!

17:29.481 --> 17:32.635
No! He is my child!

17:34.970 --> 17:38.165
You're not getting past super
positive Asian Roland Chang.

17:38.290 --> 17:39.308
Hiyah!

17:45.748 --> 17:47.817
Demon grab!

17:47.983 --> 17:50.444
Oh, honey, I forgot to tell you,
Martha invited us to...

17:50.569 --> 17:52.880
The hell spawn must die!

17:53.005 --> 17:54.448
I won't let you kill him!

Dad, you're awake!

19:42.281 --> 19:46.393
Steve... you're not
an apostate of Satan anymore.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.629
Yeah! Aside from the vivid nightmares

19:48.754 --> 19:51.098
steadily pushing me towards
madness, I feel great!

19:51.223 --> 19:53.333
Jeff?!
I thought you drowned.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.436
Nope.
All right.

19:55.561 --> 19:57.438
Oh my God, where's Nemo?

19:57.563 --> 20:00.641
Did I kill him?
Did I kill the antichrist?

20:00.766 --> 20:01.659
No, Dad.

20:01.825 --> 20:04.111
So I failed.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.213
I'm not back in the church.

20:06.338 --> 20:07.748
No, I got you back in.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.452
You know my pimp cup that I sip
purple drink and eggnog out of?

20:11.577 --> 20:13.712
- Turns out it's the holy grail.
- Nice.

20:13.929 --> 20:16.140
But what about Nemo?
We have to destroy him.

20:16.265 --> 20:19.426
I can't let you do that, Dad,
so I sent him someplace

20:19.551 --> 20:21.554
far away, where
you'll never find him.
