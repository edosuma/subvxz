08:44.847 --> 08:48.361
Since then, all work records

his number,

it may mean that somebody's
figured out he's a cop.

08:58.444 --> 08:59.622
We should warn him.

We could have gotten Vargas

He's just a smuggler.

L.O.S., that's the guy we want.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.798

the next shipment in person.

09:50.964 --> 09:52.759
L.O.S. is a fairy tale, Michael.

09:57.150 --> 09:59.848

10:33.941 --> 10:34.968
I'll look into it.

10:38.576 --> 10:41.391
Cahill believes Vargas
has a cop on his payroll.

that John was never there.

11:21.803 --> 11:23.598
I hope his new friend is luckier.

11:23.723 --> 11:25.933
John has a tendency to use people

11:26.058 --> 11:28.556

12:16.485 --> 12:18.186

12:18.311 --> 12:19.737
I don't need to tell
you what can happen

12:19.862 --> 12:21.574

12:23.867 --> 12:26.037
I just need you
to explain the system.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.729
Who would know
about Cahill's being undercover?

12:28.854 --> 12:30.541
Only his handler.

12:32.584 --> 12:34.252
What about the people
that have access

12:34.377 --> 12:35.922
to his paperwork, files?

12:36.088 --> 12:38.424
Files on undercovers
are kept only as hard copies,

12:38.590 --> 12:40.802
so people like you

Yeah, see,

13:04.774 --> 13:06.953

42:14.527 --> 42:16.278
I gave them both fair warning.

42:17.509 --> 42:18.709
They gotta go.

42:21.530 --> 42:22.999
We gotta send a message.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.678
You're always impulsive, Ray.

42:24.803 --> 42:26.335
You can't go around killing cops.

42:27.102 --> 42:28.921
And you really shouldn't
have gotten yourself arrested.

42:29.087 --> 42:30.161
I warned you.

42:30.286 --> 42:31.924
You're behind enemy lines here.

42:32.090 --> 42:33.091
Come on.

42:36.662 --> 42:39.056
[Grunting]

43:00.203 --> 43:01.329
Got your call.

43:01.495 --> 43:03.164
Looks like you got yourself
in a little trouble.

43:04.261 --> 43:05.625
It was an accident.

43:05.791 --> 43:07.668
Most accidents
don't require a shovel.

43:12.131 --> 43:13.907
Help me make this go away.

43:14.583 --> 43:15.927
I'll be indebted.

43:16.573 --> 43:18.262
You'll be a little bit more
than indebted, my friend.

43:20.263 --> 43:21.766
You belong to HR now.
