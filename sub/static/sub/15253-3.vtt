10:39.291 --> 10:40.858
Hear there's a game launch.

10:40.859 --> 10:43.059
You can always use an extra
hand there, am I right?

10:43.127 --> 10:45.829
Especially when it's
a close relative asking?

10:53.472 --> 10:55.473
Yeah, I'd... it's-

10:56.776 --> 10:58.410
I won't let you down, son.

10:58.411 --> 11:00.746
Ah! <i>Boss.</i>

11:00.813 --> 11:03.948
Hey-ey. All right.

11:04.917 --> 11:08.018
Grimes. Manager. Speak.

11:08.086 --> 11:09.420
Mm-hmm.

11:09.421 --> 11:11.156
<i>What?</i>

11:11.157 --> 11:12.624
What do you mean,
we're only getting

11:12.625 --> 11:13.758
six copies of "Spy Attack"?

11:13.759 --> 11:16.828
I got 300 customers
waiting for this game-

11:16.896 --> 11:18.796
Yes, I'll hold.

11:22.501 --> 11:24.970
So, chat time?

11:25.038 --> 11:26.938
Sure.

11:27.006 --> 11:28.673
Here?

11:28.674 --> 11:31.108
Yeah, okay.

11:31.176 --> 11:33.711
Look, it's not
a big deal.

11:33.779 --> 11:36.681
I mean, well,
it is... maybe.

11:36.748 --> 11:40.383
Wh-What, it is a big deal,
Sarah? What is?

11:40.450 --> 11:42.384
I love you, Chuck,
that's the first thing.

11:43.486 --> 11:44.520
I love being with you.

11:44.521 --> 11:46.355
Ditto. Right back at ya.

11:46.356 --> 11:48.390
It's just, um...
Can we, please,

11:48.458 --> 11:50.459
just for a second...

12:00.403 --> 12:01.470
Did you just flash?

12:01.471 --> 12:05.207
Heather Chandler is
in the Intersect 2.0.

12:05.274 --> 12:07.976
She was connected to Frost.

12:08.044 --> 12:09.944
I think she knows my mom.

12:10.847 --> 12:12.481
I have to talk to her now,

12:12.482 --> 12:13.915
because the transport
will be here soon.

12:13.916 --> 12:15.350
Chuck, unless you want
Beckman to know

12:15.351 --> 12:16.618
that we're looking
for your mom,

12:16.619 --> 12:18.253
we don't have the authority
to interrogate Chandler.

12:18.254 --> 12:19.621
Well, we don't
have the authority

12:19.622 --> 12:22.157
to use the supply closet for
what it is we use it for,

12:22.224 --> 12:23.658
but we do it
anyway, don't we?

12:23.659 --> 12:25.026
Look, she knows my mom.

12:25.027 --> 12:27.028
Okay, fine. But you can't just
start whipping questions out

12:27.096 --> 12:28.496
to somebody like
Heather Chandler.

12:28.497 --> 12:30.298
It's, it's just
not gonna work.

12:30.299 --> 12:32.033
This needs to be
a real interrogation.

12:32.034 --> 12:33.501
Good cop, bad cop.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.969
How about tough cop, silent cop?

12:34.970 --> 12:36.870
Okey-dokey, which one am I?

12:37.406 --> 12:38.439
Right, right, got it.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.841
Oh, hey, uh, real quick though:

12:39.842 --> 12:41.709
Time machine.

12:41.710 --> 12:43.177
In case things go south,

12:43.178 --> 12:45.246
use "time machine"
in a sentence.

12:45.314 --> 12:47.915
That'll be code to
back off and regroup.

12:47.983 --> 12:50.451
Okay. Just remember:
Tough cop. Silent cop.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.419
Of course.

13:06.868 --> 13:09.170
We need information on an
arms deal you were involved in,

13:09.237 --> 13:13.140
with Alexei Volkoff and an agent
whose code name is Frost.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.808
And coming my way is...?

13:14.809 --> 13:16.709
Optimal placement
at Yucca Mountain,

13:16.745 --> 13:18.178
and favorable parole review.

13:18.179 --> 13:19.613
How about a unicorn, too?

13:19.614 --> 13:21.715
I'm as likely to get that
as the crap you just offered up.

13:21.783 --> 13:24.685
You know, sarcasm is
the lowest form of...

13:24.753 --> 13:25.819
Sorry.

13:25.820 --> 13:27.387
You want to offer me something?

13:27.388 --> 13:28.856
Witness protection.

13:28.857 --> 13:31.758
For that, I'll spew on Volkoff
and Frosty the Snow Bitch.

13:31.826 --> 13:34.895
But we both know
that's handled by WitSec,

13:34.962 --> 13:36.596
who I'd be happy to talk with.

13:36.597 --> 13:38.231
Not some wispy man-boy

13:38.232 --> 13:39.900
and a bottle blond
with a daddy complex.

13:39.901 --> 13:42.335
You-you got a lot of nerve
talking to her like that.

13:42.403 --> 13:45.138
Burton can handle a little
ribbing from an old pal.

13:45.206 --> 13:47.173
You're her partner, Chuck,
not her boyfriend.

13:51.111 --> 13:53.011
Wait.

13:53.581 --> 13:55.148
You two are actually together?

13:55.149 --> 13:57.116
Uh-us? We? No.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.451
We're not, no.

13:58.452 --> 13:59.786
Oh, get out!

13:59.787 --> 14:01.655
You kids are an item!

14:01.656 --> 14:03.924
He's not just your partner.

14:03.991 --> 14:06.292
Isn't spy sex great?

14:06.360 --> 14:07.594
Heather, we were
discussing your-

14:07.595 --> 14:09.763
So. How deep
are you? Shacking up?

14:09.830 --> 14:11.998
Doing the dog thing first,
or straight to babies?

14:12.066 --> 14:13.833
One?

14:13.834 --> 14:15.734
Five?

14:15.970 --> 14:16.970
Time machine.

14:16.971 --> 14:18.805
Time machine? Really?

14:18.806 --> 14:20.706
Right. Okay...

14:23.877 --> 14:25.511
When I said use it
in a sentence,

14:25.512 --> 14:27.447
I was thinking more
along the lines of,

14:27.514 --> 14:29.148
"You want to relive
your past, honey?

14:29.149 --> 14:30.350
"Then get a time machine."

14:30.351 --> 14:32.219
You know, we really
need to take this slow.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.120
Absolutely. Look, I'm sorry
I lost it in there,

14:34.155 --> 14:35.789
If you let her
get under your skin,

14:35.790 --> 14:37.224
about the living together
thing, and about-

14:37.225 --> 14:38.458
the other thing
that she mentioned-

14:38.459 --> 14:39.626
we're not gonna
get anywhere.

14:39.627 --> 14:41.495
The other-other thing?
What is that other thing?

14:41.496 --> 14:43.497
Remember:
Tough. Silent.

14:43.565 --> 14:45.465
Do not let her get
under your skin.

14:45.466 --> 14:47.768
She's, she's not.
She won't- what? Hey.

14:47.835 --> 14:50.103
Okay.

14:54.475 --> 14:56.375
Food, Panzer.

14:59.581 --> 15:01.382
We can contact WitSec...

15:01.383 --> 15:03.017
So when did you two
start dating for reals?

15:03.018 --> 15:05.052
But first we need
a good faith offering.

15:05.119 --> 15:07.321
You know why she won't
talk about this, Chuck.

15:07.388 --> 15:09.156
Because it makes
her edgy.

15:09.157 --> 15:10.724
I get it.

15:10.725 --> 15:13.326
You met my so-called
husband/con victim, right?

15:13.394 --> 15:15.228
I toyed
with normal life.

15:15.229 --> 15:17.264
Played happy homemaker
for a while.

15:17.331 --> 15:20.467
And as soon as he got serious,
I robbed him blind.

15:20.535 --> 15:23.637
My advice? Pull the ripcord
before you get fried.

15:23.704 --> 15:25.338
The only thing getting pulled
is a rope-

15:25.339 --> 15:26.773
Hey, look at my time machine!

15:26.774 --> 15:28.674
We have an appointment.

15:29.310 --> 15:30.577
I'm gonna handle this.

15:30.578 --> 15:33.579
I can handle multiple
stressors at once.

15:33.647 --> 15:35.447
Angry mob? Of course.

15:35.448 --> 15:37.986
Lifetime of calling Big Mike...

15:38.053 --> 15:40.155
"Dad"?

15:40.223 --> 15:42.357
I really do not
like that woman.

15:42.425 --> 15:43.591
Yeah. Yeah, that's clear.

15:43.592 --> 15:45.994
What's not is why
this topic of you and me

15:46.061 --> 15:47.961
is such a hot button.
What's going on?

15:49.264 --> 15:51.232
Uh, Chuck, we have a problem.

15:51.299 --> 15:53.333
We do? Is that what
you wanted to chat about?

15:53.401 --> 15:55.902
'Cause I thought we were <i>en fuego
- </i> No, we have a serious problem.

16:14.602 --> 16:16.936
If he's trying to escape,
why doesn't he just run?

16:17.004 --> 16:19.806
This might be about me. I kicked
his ass on an airplane once.

16:19.874 --> 16:21.741
Hey, Chandler.

16:21.742 --> 16:23.642
Mr. Volkoff says hello.

16:24.512 --> 16:26.412
You send her out now,
and no one else dies.

16:26.414 --> 16:28.314
Don't open that door.

16:30.450 --> 16:31.717
Heather?

16:31.718 --> 16:33.118
What is going on?
What is this about Volkoff?

16:33.119 --> 16:34.453
This morning,

16:34.454 --> 16:36.288
I got a transfer to Yucca
Mountain, out of the blue.

16:36.289 --> 16:38.189
I get in the transport, and that
monster's in the other cage.

16:38.190 --> 16:40.391
Volkoff engineered the transfer?

16:40.459 --> 16:41.593
He's capable of it.

16:41.594 --> 16:42.961
Wh-Why would he want to?

16:42.962 --> 16:44.028
What did you do?

16:44.029 --> 16:45.929
Nothing.
He's being petty.

16:47.130 --> 16:48.798
I blew
a half-a-billion-dollar deal.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.366
The F-22 plans
were for him.

16:50.367 --> 16:52.267
I guess he's mad.

16:52.636 --> 16:54.536
Come on, Casey. Pick up.

16:55.437 --> 16:56.638
Come on, Casey.

16:56.639 --> 16:58.274
Real fast, you
just inform the...

16:58.275 --> 17:00.377
anxious horde that the
game distributor made

17:00.445 --> 17:02.546
a slight error and there's going
to be a delay in delivery time.

17:02.614 --> 17:04.013
You know, two weeks.

17:04.015 --> 17:05.316
Sounds like a job
for the manager.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.584
No games.

17:06.585 --> 17:08.551
Casey.

17:08.619 --> 17:09.917
Casey, a prisoner has escaped
in Castle,

17:09.919 --> 17:10.919
and we're trapped

17:10.920 --> 17:12.819
in cell six.
On my way.

17:13.790 --> 17:15.124
Colonel, I know

17:15.125 --> 17:16.492
I'm supposed to be upstairs,

17:16.492 --> 17:17.893
but Doc Bollywood was
staring down my shirt

17:17.894 --> 17:21.029
and those losers in line
are just freaking me out.

17:21.096 --> 17:22.996
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just get to the cell block...

17:29.937 --> 17:31.971
Greta! Greta, what's happening?

17:33.139 --> 17:35.074
She's indisposed.

17:42.449 --> 17:44.617
Uh, uh. Guys, guys,

17:44.685 --> 17:46.652
uh, Panzer's on the computer
right now,

17:46.720 --> 17:47.753
but I can't see
what he's doing.

17:47.754 --> 17:49.121
Buying patio umbrellas.

17:49.122 --> 17:51.022
He's trying to get to us,
you dope.

17:51.057 --> 17:53.091
Boy, you're a charmer.

18:08.774 --> 18:11.576
Walker, you're going to have to
override the Castle lockdown.

18:11.643 --> 18:12.744
Can't get in.

18:12.745 --> 18:14.012
I didn't put the system
into lockdown.

18:14.013 --> 18:15.615
I just locked the door
to cell six.

18:15.616 --> 18:16.649
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:16.650 --> 18:18.017
Panzer locked us in?

18:18.018 --> 18:19.285
This is not good, people, okay?

18:19.286 --> 18:20.686
I've been locked
in enclosed spaces

18:20.687 --> 18:22.054
with this guy before.
I handled it fine,

18:22.055 --> 18:23.955
but he got very edgy.

18:30.132 --> 18:32.432
He's using the mainframe
to open each cell door.

18:32.500 --> 18:34.367
There's a fire override. I'm
going to have to access it.

18:34.368 --> 18:36.803
Hold on.

18:36.870 --> 18:38.774
Come on, come on.

18:41.778 --> 18:43.678
Door two's open.

18:44.615 --> 18:46.282
Hello, Colonel Casey.
Welcome to the new

18:46.283 --> 18:47.717
Castle override mainframe.

18:47.718 --> 18:48.817
How can I help you today?

18:48.818 --> 18:50.518
You got to be kidding me.

18:50.519 --> 18:52.886
I'm sorry.
Could you repeat that?

18:55.022 --> 18:57.156
And door three.

18:57.224 --> 18:59.659
Location of fire
emergency override.

18:59.727 --> 19:02.861
Did you say
"hire nursery overhige"?

19:02.929 --> 19:04.763
Why would I say "overhige"?
It's not even a real word.

19:04.764 --> 19:05.897
I'm sorry.

19:05.898 --> 19:07.798
I didn't get that.

19:08.667 --> 19:10.567
Door five.

19:12.838 --> 19:17.006
Fire emergency override.
Where is it? Or you die.

19:17.074 --> 19:19.642
The fire emergency override
is behind my monitor.

19:19.709 --> 19:21.777
Just press control, escape...

19:28.052 --> 19:29.353
Thank you, Casey.

19:29.354 --> 19:31.254
Okay, ladies,
let's go. Move out.

19:32.155 --> 19:33.722
You go first. Scare the rats.

19:33.723 --> 19:35.657
No, you go first
so I can keep an eye on you.

19:35.725 --> 19:37.158
Sarah.

19:37.159 --> 19:39.059
You. Me. Go now. Come on.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.175
<i>Dude, we're totally screwed.</i>

19:49.176 --> 19:51.778
No. No. This is a positive.

19:51.846 --> 19:54.047
Okay? Today, we get
to be challenged.

19:54.115 --> 19:55.682
So I'm going to
make a phone call

19:55.683 --> 19:57.350
and I'm going to get us the
games that we were promised.

19:57.351 --> 19:59.987
Now, you will handle
the launch presentation.

20:00.054 --> 20:01.188
At midnight,

20:01.189 --> 20:02.423
we will settle the crowd.

20:02.424 --> 20:03.657
You will read
from the script.

20:03.658 --> 20:05.826
And you'll read from
the script slowly.

20:05.894 --> 20:07.895
You don't just drop
a role in a man's lap,

20:07.963 --> 20:11.065
and say, "Go, seal,
clap for your fish."

20:11.133 --> 20:13.134
I must make this my own

20:13.201 --> 20:15.136
if I am to undertake it.

20:15.203 --> 20:17.103
Whatever.

20:19.074 --> 20:20.908
This is no big deal.
I can handle this.

20:20.909 --> 20:22.376
I can handle
multiple stressors.

20:22.377 --> 20:24.178
Ugh.

20:24.179 --> 20:25.913
What monkey flung this?

20:25.914 --> 20:27.814
No.

20:33.255 --> 20:35.022
You know, I was thinking

20:35.023 --> 20:38.559
about how some of my favorite
movies wind up in air ducts.

20:38.627 --> 20:41.094
Like <i>Aliens</i> and <i>Die Hard.</i>

20:41.162 --> 20:42.796
Although,
generally speaking,

20:42.797 --> 20:44.965
it doesn't wind up well
for the duct crawlers.

20:45.033 --> 20:46.100
Thanks for that,

20:46.101 --> 20:47.568
movie dork.

20:47.569 --> 20:49.569
I bet you have, like,
a <i>Tron</i> poster in your room.

20:49.637 --> 20:50.804
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:50.805 --> 20:52.705
Keep crawling, sister.

21:12.924 --> 21:14.458
Walker, where are you?

21:14.459 --> 21:16.627
We're just passing
coupling duct 5A.

21:16.695 --> 21:18.629
Come on, come on,

21:18.697 --> 21:19.998
come on, come on.

21:19.999 --> 21:21.165
In ten feet, turn left,

21:21.166 --> 21:22.433
straight on
into the junction room.

21:22.434 --> 21:23.568
Heading there to unlock it now.

21:23.569 --> 21:24.936
Any sign of Panzer?

21:24.937 --> 21:26.804
Not at Castle.

21:26.805 --> 21:27.972
But he's after you.

21:27.973 --> 21:29.140
So watch your back.

21:29.141 --> 21:31.676
That's fantastic.
You hear that, Chuck?

21:31.743 --> 21:32.910
Stay alert, as in,

21:32.911 --> 21:35.446
don't distract yourself,
staring at my tail.

21:35.514 --> 21:37.948
Looking at your-
no, no. Thank you, no.

21:38.016 --> 21:40.050
I'm kidding. Jenny-Sarah,

21:40.118 --> 21:41.986
how did you end up
with such a goofball?

21:41.987 --> 21:44.054
Masculine goofball,
thank you very much.

21:44.122 --> 21:45.823
Oh, you're sweet.

21:45.824 --> 21:47.191
I did the sweet
guy thing, too.

21:47.192 --> 21:49.092
I know how it ends.

21:50.362 --> 21:52.931
Sorry.
Foot slipped.

21:52.999 --> 21:55.500
Ooh-ooh, touchy.

21:55.568 --> 21:57.569
Must be hitting home.

21:57.637 --> 21:59.537
Of course I am.

22:01.073 --> 22:04.642
SARAH
We're almost at the junction.

22:06.645 --> 22:09.346
Three, two, one.

22:13.418 --> 22:15.987
Nice and orderly.
You are in for the night...

22:16.055 --> 22:17.822
of your lives.

22:17.823 --> 22:21.124
Don't get your hopes up.
There's not enough games.

22:21.192 --> 22:23.026
Shh! Hey, hey. Don't say that.

22:23.027 --> 22:24.861
Everything's fine, everybody.
Everything is great.

22:24.862 --> 22:26.363
Go get your-
Listen to me.

22:26.364 --> 22:27.597
Stretch it out.

22:27.598 --> 22:29.065
Stretch it out just
a bit longer for me, guys,

22:29.066 --> 22:30.868
'cause we are almost
out of the woods.

22:30.869 --> 22:32.769
Easy, sister. We've
got this covered.

22:32.772 --> 22:34.672
Okay. We've got this covered.

22:34.674 --> 22:36.574
All right.

22:37.378 --> 22:39.112
What do we hear? Oh, yes.

22:39.113 --> 22:40.980
Jerry. What's going on, my man?

22:40.981 --> 22:43.282
What did you score me?
How many you got?

22:43.350 --> 22:45.117
What do you got?
How many games? Yeah.

22:45.118 --> 22:46.985
Yeah. Two?

22:46.986 --> 22:49.287
Two games. That's- I-
That's not enough, Jerry.

22:49.355 --> 22:51.289
I gots to have more games,
brother.

22:51.357 --> 22:52.591
Hello? Jerry?

22:52.592 --> 22:53.926
Jerry?

22:53.927 --> 22:55.529
Come on.

22:55.530 --> 22:57.297
Son, your crowd is surly.

22:57.298 --> 22:58.731
And you got no product.

22:58.732 --> 23:00.834
I don't want to tell you
how to do your business,

23:00.902 --> 23:03.036
but the sheep
need a shepherd.

23:03.103 --> 23:05.204
Yeah. They sure do.

23:05.272 --> 23:07.673
Sheep, huh?
Sweet little sheep?

23:23.391 --> 23:25.358
Okay, Casey's going to have
to unlock this for us.

23:25.426 --> 23:26.459
Until then...

23:26.460 --> 23:27.727
I'll finish what
I was saying.

23:27.728 --> 23:28.762
Running your mouth is not going

23:28.763 --> 23:29.964
to get you witness protection.

23:29.965 --> 23:31.599
You were never going to
call witness protection.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.900
So let's just call this
payback for lying.

23:36.070 --> 23:37.937
What do you mean,
payback?

23:37.938 --> 23:40.406
I got hitched to a dork,
just like you-

23:40.474 --> 23:42.442
sweet, dumb,

23:42.509 --> 23:44.777
loyal, a mutt-
and that was attractive.

23:44.845 --> 23:46.245
I thought,

23:46.246 --> 23:48.914
"This schmuck is going to
make me a better person."

23:48.981 --> 23:50.482
And for ten minutes,
I convinced myself

23:50.483 --> 23:52.117
I didn't mind
movie night

23:52.118 --> 23:53.285
or dinner at 6:00.

23:53.286 --> 23:55.420
But then my true
nature kicked in.

23:55.488 --> 23:57.722
And the reason this conversation
has Burton so upset is because

23:57.790 --> 23:59.924
it's doing the
same for her.

23:59.992 --> 24:01.292
We're the same.

24:01.293 --> 24:02.327
Not going to dignify this.

24:02.328 --> 24:04.795
Right, yeah. Because
we are professionals.

24:04.863 --> 24:07.231
And we cannot hear a word
that you are saying.

24:07.299 --> 24:09.633
She's all spy.

24:09.701 --> 24:10.868
White weddings,

24:10.869 --> 24:13.269
rug rats in a minivan?
It's not in our wiring.

24:13.337 --> 24:15.171
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

24:15.172 --> 24:17.106
Heather, guess what?
You talk too much.

24:17.174 --> 24:18.341
Burton?

24:18.342 --> 24:19.675
Be kind to him.

24:19.676 --> 24:21.677
He's too sick in love
to see the truth.

24:23.314 --> 24:25.014
Just remember,

24:25.015 --> 24:26.884
she keeps secrets for a living.

24:26.885 --> 24:28.887
Tell me, why are we
saving your life again?

24:28.954 --> 24:30.854
Because of my connection
with Frost.

24:30.890 --> 24:32.790
And my time with her in Burma.

24:33.459 --> 24:35.260
Casey?

24:35.261 --> 24:38.062
I'm right,
and she can't face it.

24:38.130 --> 24:39.731
That's why she's upset.

24:39.732 --> 24:41.398
She's not upset,
Heather. Okay?

24:41.399 --> 24:42.532
I know what she looks like

24:42.533 --> 24:43.967
when she's upset,
and it's more like...

24:43.968 --> 24:45.868
Look out!

24:49.241 --> 24:50.741
Oh!

24:50.742 --> 24:53.010
Chuck!

24:55.147 --> 24:56.948
No!

24:56.949 --> 24:58.049
Help me!

24:58.050 --> 24:59.517
Sorry, kitten.
You're on your own.

24:59.518 --> 25:01.418
You know you'd
do the same.

25:02.422 --> 25:04.322
Slipping again.
Slipping. Sarah!

25:08.561 --> 25:10.395
No, no, no.
No, no, no.

25:10.396 --> 25:12.296
Not the tie.
Not the tie.

25:31.218 --> 25:33.118
Sarah, help me!
Chuck!

25:34.254 --> 25:36.154
Help... me!

25:55.445 --> 25:57.345
Carmichael!

25:59.849 --> 26:01.884
Sarah, help me!

26:02.752 --> 26:04.652
Chuck! Come on.

26:11.695 --> 26:14.630
That felt good.

26:14.698 --> 26:16.131
You know,

26:16.132 --> 26:20.869
they wanted me to
read you this trash.

26:20.937 --> 26:22.837
But you deserve better.

26:22.838 --> 26:27.575
We, as a people,
deserve better.

26:27.643 --> 26:29.543
Yeah.

26:29.845 --> 26:30.945
So...

26:30.946 --> 26:33.915
brace yourselves for a...

26:33.983 --> 26:36.951
free-form, no-holds-barred...

26:37.019 --> 26:38.919
a- poetry slam.

26:40.121 --> 26:43.791
And a kung fu demonstration
of moves in the game Spy Attack.

26:43.859 --> 26:45.759
Can we just buy the dumb game?

26:45.761 --> 26:47.595
Yeah!
No,

26:47.596 --> 26:49.697
you cannot!

26:54.469 --> 26:57.004
SARAH
How far down did he go?

26:57.072 --> 26:58.873
Could you see the
bottom of the duct?

26:58.874 --> 27:00.375
It was too dark.

27:00.376 --> 27:02.243
And I was kind of
concentrating on his

27:02.244 --> 27:04.712
fists flying at me.

27:09.385 --> 27:11.585
This morning,
I was going to Monte Carlo.

27:11.653 --> 27:14.155
But instead, I spent the night
as a canned good.

27:14.223 --> 27:16.758
It's funny the way
that life can suck.

27:19.795 --> 27:22.030
Move and you
die, tunnel rat.

27:23.132 --> 27:24.599
All right, got him.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.767
Transport on the roof
in two minutes.

27:38.314 --> 27:40.448
Frost...

27:40.516 --> 27:42.084
last chance to deal.

27:42.085 --> 27:43.919
You're just a dog with a bone.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.655
No dice.

27:47.757 --> 27:49.157
Good luck.

27:49.158 --> 27:50.959
I'm rooting for you.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.427
But I'm certainly not
betting on you.

27:52.428 --> 27:53.428
Shut it, convict.

27:53.429 --> 27:54.863
You're not
letting Heather

27:54.864 --> 27:55.931
get to you, are you?

27:55.932 --> 27:58.800
No, of course not.
I'm all good.

27:58.867 --> 28:02.302
I know your "all goods" and
that was not a real "all good."

28:02.370 --> 28:04.938
It was a fake "all good."

28:05.006 --> 28:07.274
I'm just curious
why what she said

28:07.341 --> 28:08.708
got under your
skin like that.

28:08.709 --> 28:11.578
Well, once we get
rid of these guys,

28:11.646 --> 28:13.546
we will have our chat.

28:17.752 --> 28:19.652
What are you smiling at?

28:23.023 --> 28:24.958
This doesn't
smell right.

28:27.494 --> 28:28.761
They're not CIA.

28:28.762 --> 28:30.662
They're Volkoff's men.

28:31.064 --> 28:32.964
Down, down, down, down!

28:43.806 --> 28:45.773
Volkoff must have
intercepted our transport.

28:56.352 --> 28:58.186
Chuck, we'll handle
the gunfight.

28:58.187 --> 29:00.087
You go after the prisoner.

29:09.698 --> 29:12.199
You go for the exit.
I got you covered.

29:17.906 --> 29:19.806
Casey!

29:22.411 --> 29:24.311
I'm all right.

29:25.414 --> 29:27.181
Your man's wounded, pinned down.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.182
Give us Chandler

29:28.183 --> 29:30.083
and you both live.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.920
Hand me over.

29:33.922 --> 29:36.524
Save your ass.

29:36.592 --> 29:38.692
We both know what you're
gonna do, so just do it.

29:38.760 --> 29:39.959
You kept me alive
for information,

29:39.960 --> 29:42.595
but it's not worth
dying over.

29:42.663 --> 29:44.263
I know you, Walker.

29:44.264 --> 29:47.033
I know
what you're going to do.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.070
You don't know who I am
or what I want

29:51.138 --> 29:52.605
or the thoughts in my head.

29:52.606 --> 29:55.041
We have nothing
in common.

30:09.791 --> 30:10.991
On the count
of three,

30:10.992 --> 30:12.892
two, one.

30:35.779 --> 30:37.679
That was my last bullet.

30:39.983 --> 30:41.917
The flea-ridden masses
infest my house.

30:41.985 --> 30:42.985
Do I cry,

30:42.986 --> 30:44.354
perchance to die?

30:44.355 --> 30:45.455
No, McFly!

30:45.456 --> 30:46.456
This game launch

30:46.457 --> 30:48.158
will not be televised.

30:48.159 --> 30:50.528
Enough, man,
just give us the game!

30:50.596 --> 30:52.096
We want the game!

30:52.097 --> 30:54.633
CROWD We want the
game! We want the game!

30:54.700 --> 30:55.834
We want the game!

30:55.835 --> 30:58.437
We want the game!
We want the game!

30:58.505 --> 31:00.405
We want the game!

31:00.407 --> 31:01.907
We want the game!
Guys!

31:01.908 --> 31:02.941
We want the game!

31:02.942 --> 31:04.842
Guys!

31:05.111 --> 31:06.511
The games didn't show.

31:06.512 --> 31:08.912
So shut up

31:08.980 --> 31:10.681
and let the poetry slam you.

31:10.682 --> 31:12.916
Thank you.

31:16.286 --> 31:17.486
Freeze, Panzer.

31:17.487 --> 31:20.188
Look awful shaky
with that pea shooter, boy.

31:20.256 --> 31:21.689
How's your aim
in tight quarters?

31:21.690 --> 31:22.990
Perfect.

31:22.991 --> 31:24.858
'Cause that's the gas line.

31:24.859 --> 31:27.427
You hit that instead of me,
this whole building goes.

31:27.495 --> 31:28.895
So it is.

31:28.896 --> 31:30.931
But that doesn't matter,
because you're trapped.

31:33.035 --> 31:34.970
Yeah, I don't think
these air ducts

31:35.038 --> 31:37.707
were meant to hold 400 pounds,
and since most of that is you,

31:37.775 --> 31:39.675
I need you to back up now.

31:42.679 --> 31:44.112
You're losing
them, son.

31:44.113 --> 31:47.148
They're going
to rampage.

31:47.215 --> 31:48.882
Hey! Hey, hey, don't!

31:48.883 --> 31:51.252
Halt! Halt!

31:51.320 --> 31:53.220
Halt! Everybody just- whoa.

31:55.890 --> 31:56.990
Oh, no. Oh, no!

31:56.991 --> 31:58.158
♪ ♪

31:58.159 --> 32:00.327
Oh, Morgan, Morgan!

32:01.432 --> 32:02.601
Back up.
You back up.

32:02.602 --> 32:04.502
You back up.

32:08.409 --> 32:10.309
Ow!

32:26.261 --> 32:28.161
The engagement ring!

32:53.591 --> 32:55.292
Look, this is
a call to arms.

32:55.293 --> 32:58.095
I brought my black case
for just such an occasion.

32:58.163 --> 33:00.130
It's in my car.
Go get it for me.

33:00.198 --> 33:01.565
I don't work for you.

33:01.566 --> 33:03.467
I do work for you.

33:46.379 --> 33:48.279
Ow!

33:49.314 --> 33:51.548
Get on your feet, son.

33:51.616 --> 33:55.151
I can't. I can't.
The-the-the...

33:58.089 --> 33:59.656
There's a riot going on.

33:59.657 --> 34:01.657
Right, right.

34:01.725 --> 34:03.825
But your engagement ring-
it fell out of my pocket.

34:03.893 --> 34:05.727
I've looked everywhere.
I can't find it.

34:05.728 --> 34:07.628
I screwed up, okay?
I need your help.

34:09.928 --> 34:13.629
You find the ring,
I'll take care of the riot.

34:13.697 --> 34:15.597
Yes, sir.

34:21.402 --> 34:23.069
Excuse me, fools.

34:23.070 --> 34:26.007
I said excuse me, fools!

34:35.585 --> 34:37.621
That's not fair.

34:37.688 --> 34:40.489
What is this madness?

34:40.556 --> 34:45.494
Yes, we promised something
we couldn't deliver.

34:45.561 --> 34:50.764
Yes, had we delivered,
you would have been overcharged.

34:50.831 --> 34:54.300
Is that any reason
to behave like this?

34:54.368 --> 34:58.771
You got to ditch your lives
and spend a full week

34:58.838 --> 35:02.007
with your dorky friends
talking video games,

35:02.075 --> 35:05.545
which no sane person would
have ever done with you.

35:05.612 --> 35:07.647
And because we came up

35:07.715 --> 35:09.983
a little short on supply,

35:10.051 --> 35:11.951
there's a riot?

35:13.087 --> 35:14.955
Hell no!

35:14.956 --> 35:17.591
This ain't no video game.

35:17.659 --> 35:18.925
It's not.

35:18.926 --> 35:20.727
This is real life.

35:20.728 --> 35:24.197
The truth of life.
This violence ends

35:24.265 --> 35:26.367
now!
Not later.

35:26.434 --> 35:28.068
Peacefully!
With peace.

35:28.069 --> 35:30.638
Quietly!
With a whisper.

35:30.705 --> 35:33.207
All civil like.
Like a civilian.

35:38.046 --> 35:39.747
Move it.
Get out of my way.

35:39.748 --> 35:40.914
Excuse me, son.

35:40.915 --> 35:44.351
You'd best stop-

35:44.419 --> 35:48.988
or I will come down there
and make an example of you.

35:49.056 --> 35:50.590
Try and stop me, fat man.

35:50.591 --> 35:52.325
What? Who's this...?

35:52.326 --> 35:53.960
Give me the Disco Stick.

35:53.961 --> 35:55.894
That boy is family,

35:55.962 --> 36:00.597
and my name...
is Mike.

36:12.476 --> 36:13.975
Big Mike.

36:13.976 --> 36:15.744
Mr. Big Mike.

36:15.745 --> 36:17.712
All right?

36:17.779 --> 36:19.679
Well done.
Yeah.

36:25.127 --> 36:27.228
Another Purple Heart, Casey.

36:27.296 --> 36:28.964
I'm fine.

36:28.965 --> 36:30.666
Gonna be laid up
for a while.

36:30.667 --> 36:32.234
Paid vacation.

36:32.235 --> 36:35.572
Yeah. I can't
stand the silence.

36:35.639 --> 36:39.508
Well, maybe you could use
the time to meet up with Alex.

36:40.877 --> 36:43.345
Figure out what your role
is in her life.

36:43.412 --> 36:44.613
Hmm.

36:44.614 --> 36:46.883
You should do the same
for Bartowski.

36:46.950 --> 36:48.985
So we can get back

36:49.052 --> 36:50.319
to normal around here, hmm?

36:50.320 --> 36:53.289
Whatever that means.

37:02.766 --> 37:04.734
Operation Beacon.

37:04.802 --> 37:07.603
That's where I met Frost.

37:09.739 --> 37:11.073
What's Beacon?

37:11.074 --> 37:13.941
It was supposed to be
an underground arms pipeline,

37:14.009 --> 37:15.910
but I lit out
before it was active.

37:15.977 --> 37:18.278
Frost was always
around Volkoff.

37:18.346 --> 37:20.146
Doing what exactly?

37:20.147 --> 37:21.647
What does that mean?

37:21.648 --> 37:24.082
I couldn't get the full
gist of their relationship.

37:24.150 --> 37:26.050
But she was there.

37:27.186 --> 37:29.086
Maybe she had to be.

37:29.088 --> 37:30.922
That's all I know.

37:30.923 --> 37:33.624
Hugo's ready to roll.

37:35.293 --> 37:37.193
Let's go.

37:38.096 --> 37:40.400
Thank you.

37:43.204 --> 37:46.105
Maybe you're right-
maybe we aren't alike at all.

37:46.173 --> 37:49.608
Maybe you are capable
of love, affection

37:49.676 --> 37:50.976
and vulnerability.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.878
I hope so.

37:52.946 --> 37:55.781
Chuck seems like
a really nice guy.

37:55.848 --> 37:58.117
And he's really in love.

37:58.184 --> 38:00.084
Are you?

38:00.953 --> 38:02.853
Good-bye, Heather.

38:35.757 --> 38:37.791
I looked everywhere,
Big Mike.

38:37.859 --> 38:39.759
I couldn't find your ring.

38:39.761 --> 38:41.195
But I did find this.

38:41.196 --> 38:44.932
Don't give me this because
you think I'm upset.

38:45.000 --> 38:49.536
The assistant manager's vest
is a sacred vestment.

38:49.604 --> 38:51.605
No, I know. Believe me.

38:51.673 --> 38:53.974
But you're the best.
You can handle anything.

38:54.042 --> 38:57.343
And I would be proud to have
you as assistant manager.

38:57.411 --> 39:02.248
Although I understand if you
couldn't quite forgive me yet.

39:02.316 --> 39:05.218
I just want you to know that
I'm really sorry about the ring.

39:05.285 --> 39:07.920
Marriage isn't
about a ring.

39:07.988 --> 39:12.158
It's a lifelong commitment of
compassion and understanding.

39:12.226 --> 39:16.595
Especially for your
spouse's idiot relations.

39:16.663 --> 39:18.563
All is forgiven.

39:18.565 --> 39:20.267
Here.

39:20.268 --> 39:22.269
This is yours.

39:22.337 --> 39:24.305
And for what it's worth,

39:24.372 --> 39:29.211
you have my permission
to... marry my mom.

39:30.246 --> 39:32.348
Son.

39:52.270 --> 39:53.737
So Beacon-

39:53.738 --> 39:56.037
it's a... it's a
place to start.

39:56.105 --> 39:58.406
Bringing us to the...

39:58.473 --> 40:00.107
long-delayed

40:00.108 --> 40:03.945
and much-anticipated...
chat.

40:06.648 --> 40:10.218
The other night when you
repeated what Awesome said

40:10.286 --> 40:13.053
about us being next
having kids-

40:13.121 --> 40:15.757
it scared me.

40:16.793 --> 40:18.260
Okay.

40:18.261 --> 40:20.361
And I wanted to tell
you earlier, but, um,

40:20.429 --> 40:22.864
I didn't, and I've been
thinking about it all day long.

40:22.931 --> 40:25.266
And Heather kept
poking the topic

40:25.334 --> 40:27.101
with a needle.

40:27.102 --> 40:30.237
You're nothing like her.

40:30.305 --> 40:34.508
For a long time,
I was exactly like her.

40:34.576 --> 40:37.544
And it took me a night
in the guts of the building

40:37.612 --> 40:39.546
to realize that
I'm not anymore.

40:39.614 --> 40:41.581
At all.

40:41.649 --> 40:43.549
And I don't want to be.

40:45.987 --> 40:50.390
But I-I do need
to take things slow.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.358
I'm not ready for
parenthood either.

40:54.229 --> 40:55.529
One day, hopefully,

40:55.530 --> 40:58.565
but not now,
not yet anyway.

40:58.632 --> 40:59.799
Who are we kidding?

40:59.800 --> 41:01.801
I'm barely on solid
food myself, so...

41:03.504 --> 41:04.971
Okay.

41:04.972 --> 41:07.373
So, slow.

41:09.209 --> 41:11.010
Super slow.

41:11.011 --> 41:12.911
Really slow.

41:26.059 --> 41:27.426
Let's start small.

41:27.427 --> 41:30.129
You tell me
ready or not ready.

41:30.197 --> 41:32.097
Okay.

41:32.933 --> 41:34.066
We're on a trip.

41:34.067 --> 41:36.235
One of us forgets
our toothbrush.

41:38.104 --> 41:39.338
Do we share?

41:39.339 --> 41:41.574
I am ready to share
your toothbrush.

41:43.009 --> 41:44.276
Oh, oh, using the bathroom.

41:44.277 --> 41:46.812
Door open or shut?

41:46.880 --> 41:48.780
Door shut. Always.

41:48.782 --> 41:50.182
Preferably with
the sink running

41:50.183 --> 41:51.617
or the radio on.

41:51.618 --> 41:53.519
Yes.
Yeah.
