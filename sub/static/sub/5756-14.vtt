WEBVTT

00:00.468 --> 00:04.069
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
PRETTY LITTLE LIARS...

00:04.071 --> 00:05.904
WHO DOES NOT WANT A BIG
SLOBBERING BEAST

00:05.906 --> 00:07.673
WHO CAN CATCH A BALL
IN THE END ZONE?

00:07.675 --> 00:09.441
THAT'S IT!

00:09.443 --> 00:13.245
I AM BEING HONEST WITH YOU.
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.646
AND I THINK YOU DESERVE
A BETTER BOYFRIEND.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.049
YOUR FRIEND LEFT
HER BACKPACK HERE.

00:17.051 --> 00:18.450
I RETURNED IT TO HER PARENTS.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.185
ARE YOU DOING DRUGS WITH HER?

00:20.187 --> 00:21.186
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:21.188 --> 00:22.821
ARE YOU STONED?
NO!

00:22.823 --> 00:25.357
SO WHAT WERE YOU AND NOEL KAHN
TALKING ABOUT TODAY?

00:25.359 --> 00:27.526
JUST TELLING ME ABOUT SOME
STUPID RUMOR HE HAD HEARD.

00:27.528 --> 00:29.595
WHAT KIND OF RUMOR?
THE ENGLISH TEACHER--

00:29.597 --> 00:31.697
YOU KNOW, THE ONE
THAT YOU THINK IS SO GREAT?

00:31.699 --> 00:33.565
HE'S HAVING A THING
WITH ONE OF HIS STUDENTS.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.834
WE WERE DAYS AWAY
FROM A FORECLOSURE.

00:35.836 --> 00:38.537
THIS IS OUR LIFELINE,
AND I WILL PAY IT ALL BACK.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.540
WELL, IF THE BANK FINDS OUT
ABOUT YOUR UNAUTHORIZED LOAN,

00:41.542 --> 00:42.875
THAT'S LIKE A FELONY, RIGHT?

00:42.877 --> 00:44.510
IT'S ONLY A FELONY
IF THEY FIND OUT.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.883
"DON'T SAY I NEVER
GAVE YOU ANYTHING.

00:50.885 --> 00:52.651
TURN ON YOUR COMPUTER. A."

00:55.089 --> 00:57.556
<i> IF THE GIRLS KNEW</i>
<i> I WAS SEEING YOU,</i>

00:57.558 --> 01:00.793
<i> OH, MY GOD,</i>
<i> THEY'D NEVER SHUT UP ABOUT IT.</i>

01:00.795 --> 01:03.362
<i> I WISH</i>
<i> THEY WERE MORE MATURE, BUT...</i>

01:03.364 --> 01:05.931
<i> WE DON'T HAVE</i>
<i> A LOT OF TIME.</i>

01:05.933 --> 01:08.133
<i> I HAVE TO GET BACK</i>
<i> BEFORE THEY WAKE UP.</i>

01:09.703 --> 01:12.571
<i> I KNOW YOU WANNA KISS ME.</i>

01:12.573 --> 01:14.740
SHE DOESN'T EVEN LOOK SCARED.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.508
DID ALISON EVER LOOK SCARED?

01:23.317 --> 01:24.716
<i> COME CLOSER.</i>

01:36.397 --> 01:37.329
<i> ( groans )</i>

01:42.570 --> 01:44.103
HE PUSHED HER, DIDN'T HE?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.938
ALL THAT MUMBLING AND GROANING,

01:45.940 --> 01:47.639
MAYBE SHE WAS GRIPPING
THE GROUND BECAUSE SHE WAS--

01:47.641 --> 01:49.942
LOOKING FOR A WEAPON
TO DEFEND HERSELF?

01:49.944 --> 01:51.610
WHY ARE YOU SNAPPING AT ME?

01:51.612 --> 01:53.879
I'M JUST TRYING TO GIVE
YOUR CREEPY BROTHER AN OUT.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.048
IN-LAW, OKAY?
IAN IS MY CREEPY<i> BROTHER-IN-LAW.</i>

01:56.050 --> 01:59.618
OKAY, WHATEVER HE IS,
HE JUST MARRIED YOUR SISTER,
AND HE MIGHT BE A KILLER.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.221
THIS DEFINITELY PROVES
THAT HE WAS WITH HER
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

02:02.223 --> 02:06.859
CAN WE JUST WATCH THIS VIDEO
ONE MORE TIME AND FIGURE OUT
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING?

02:06.861 --> 02:08.927
NO, PLEASE.
I CAN'T WATCH THIS AGAIN.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.363
YEAH, EM'S RIGHT.
LET'S JUST GIVE IT A REST.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.069
IS ANYBODY ELSE FREEZING?

02:17.071 --> 02:19.071
I'LL MAKE SOME HOT CHOCOLATE.

02:19.073 --> 02:21.273
HOT CHOCOLATE?
WHAT IS THIS, CAMP TAMARACK?

02:21.275 --> 02:23.142
WE CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND
SINGING<i> KUMBAYA.</i>

02:23.144 --> 02:24.977
WE HAVE TO HAND OVER
THAT VIDEO.

02:24.979 --> 02:27.546
WHAT VIDEO?

02:27.548 --> 02:32.184
UH, HANNA RENTED<i> TOOTSIE,</i>
BUT SHE LEFT IT AT HOME.

02:32.186 --> 02:34.286
OH, WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME
TO HANG WITH US IN THE BARN.

02:34.288 --> 02:36.455
YOUR SISTER PICKED
SOME CHICK FLICK ON DEMAND.

02:37.925 --> 02:39.791
WHERE DO WE KEEP
THE POPCORN?

02:39.793 --> 02:41.827
THAT DRAWER.
OH. OKAY.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.432
OH, EMILY, BY THE WAY,
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO ASK YOU,

02:47.434 --> 02:50.235
YOU READY TO TRADE
YOUR GOGGLES IN
FOR A FIELD HOCKEY STICK?

02:50.237 --> 02:51.904
YEAH, WE COULD USE
SOME SPEED ON OFFENSE.

02:51.906 --> 02:54.573
RIGHT, SPENCE?
MM-HMM.

02:54.575 --> 02:57.409
THANKS,
I'M STILL INTO SWIMMING.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.045
WELL, YOU WOULDN'T BE IF YOU
SAW WHAT THEY SKIMMED OUT
OF THAT POOL EVERY WEEK.

03:02.950 --> 03:06.218
WHAT'S UP? DID I WALK INTO
THE MIDDLE OF A CHICK FLICK?

03:08.622 --> 03:11.323
OKAY, I GET IT--
NO GUYS ALLOWED.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.428
( sighs )

03:16.430 --> 03:18.830
GOD, THAT WAS CLOSE.

03:18.832 --> 03:23.235
SPENCER, HOW CAN YOU EVEN
SLEEP HERE, KNOWING THAT
HE'S LIVING IN YOUR BACKYARD?

03:23.237 --> 03:26.805
WE HAVE TO GIVE THAT TAPE
TO THE POLICE...TONIGHT.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.974
AND WHEN THEY ASK US
WHERE WE GOT IT?

03:28.976 --> 03:30.175
FORGOT THE SALT.

03:43.324 --> 03:45.524
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET,</i>
<i> CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

03:45.526 --> 03:48.026
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE</i>
<i> YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

03:48.028 --> 03:50.462
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

03:50.464 --> 03:53.065
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

03:53.067 --> 03:55.367
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

03:55.369 --> 03:57.869
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

03:57.871 --> 04:00.205
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

04:00.207 --> 04:02.507
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM</i>
<i> IS DEAD ¶</i>

04:06.347 --> 04:07.679
OKAY, DOES THIS LOOK EVEN?

04:09.450 --> 04:11.350
EARTH TO HANNA.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.884
SORRY, WHAT?

04:12.886 --> 04:15.287
OH, UH, YEAH, IT'S FINE.

04:15.289 --> 04:20.058
OKAY, REMIND ME,
HOW COME YOU'RE THE CHAIR
OF THE DECORATING COMMITTEE,

04:20.060 --> 04:21.460
AND WE'RE THE ONE'S DECORATING?

04:21.462 --> 04:23.028
I CAN'T CLIMB UP THERE.

04:23.030 --> 04:26.365
I'M SAVING MY ONE GOOD LEG
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.567
HANNA, THE PRINTER GUY
NEEDS TO BE PAID.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.569
DID YOU ORDER SIX BARACKS
AND NO MICHELLES?

04:30.571 --> 04:33.905
ARE YOU KIDDING?
TELL HIM NO MICHELLES,
NO MONEY.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.407
UH, MAYBE YOU SHOULD TELL HIM.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.209
HE SAYS
THIS IS WHAT YOU ORDERED.

04:37.211 --> 04:38.477
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.181
OH, AND IT'S A LITTLE LOW
ON THE LEFT.

04:43.183 --> 04:45.484
CAN WE JUST BREAK
HER OTHER LEG?

04:47.855 --> 04:50.922
HEY, ARE WE STILL
DOING THIS AT LUNCH?

04:50.924 --> 04:54.593
IF BY "THIS," YOU MEAN TAKING
YOUR LAPTOP TO THE POLICE,

04:54.595 --> 04:56.194
THEN, YES, WE ARE.

04:56.196 --> 04:57.829
BUT NO ONE
CALLED OVER THERE, RIGHT?

04:57.831 --> 04:59.264
THEY DON'T KNOW
THAT WE'RE COMING.

04:59.266 --> 05:00.499
WHAT'S WITH THE COLD FEET?

05:00.501 --> 05:02.334
IT'S JUST...

05:02.336 --> 05:05.337
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT THINKING.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.673
WHAT IF THIS IS A SETUP?

05:07.675 --> 05:10.375
"A" COULD'VE PLANTED
THIS VIDEO ON MY LAPTOP,

05:10.377 --> 05:12.110
KNOWING THAT
WE WOULD TURN IT IN.

05:12.112 --> 05:14.212
GUYS, LET'S NOT TRY
TO SECOND-GUESS "A."

05:14.214 --> 05:17.149
WE'VE BEEN THERE.
WE ENDED UP SCARED
OF AN OLD CON

05:17.151 --> 05:21.153
WHO TURNED OUT TO BE
JUST A JEALOUS FREAK
LOOKING FOR A BETTER GRADE.

05:21.155 --> 05:25.090
YEAH, LET'S NOT FORGET "A"
ALSO TRIED TO KILL HANNA
FOR KNOWING TOO MUCH.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.492
WE COULD BE
WALKING INTO A TRAP.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.027
YOU ARE ALREADY LIVING IN IT.

05:29.029 --> 05:35.033
NO. IAN...
MIGHT HAVE DONE OTHER STUFF,

05:35.035 --> 05:36.702
BUT HE'S NOT "A."

05:36.704 --> 05:39.771
THERE'S NO WAY HE'D WANT US
KNOWING THIS VIDEO EVEN EXISTS.

05:39.773 --> 05:42.040
BUT IT DOES,
AND THE POLICE NEED TO KNOW

05:42.042 --> 05:43.875
WHAT HAPPENED TO ALISON
THAT NIGHT.

05:43.877 --> 05:46.712
TOBY GAVE ALISON HIS SWEATER
<i> BEFORE</i> SHE SAW IAN,

05:46.714 --> 05:49.748
AND TOBY SHOULDN'T GO TO JAIL
FOR A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.351
SHE'S RIGHT.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.520
HEY, I'LL DRIVE YOU
TO THE STATION DURING LUNCH.

06:00.527 --> 06:01.560
( sighs )

06:01.562 --> 06:02.761
HEY, HOW'D IT GO?

06:02.763 --> 06:04.429
NOT WELL.

06:04.431 --> 06:07.432
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD CALL
THE SHOP AND GET HIM FIRED.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.735
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK
HE MAKES AN HOUR?

06:09.737 --> 06:12.504
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS HAVE HIM
SPONSOR YOU FOR THE DANCE.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.773
ASK THE MANAGER TO PONY UP
A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.376
HOW MUCH HAVE YOU RAISED?
SOME, NOT A LOT.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.078
YOUR MOM'S GONNA THROW DOWN,
THOUGH, RIGHT?
OF COURSE.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.748
HAVE HER PASS THAT AT WORK.
THAT'S WHAT MY MOM DID.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.984
HEY, DO YOU THINK YOUR MOM
WOULD HIRE ME AGAIN TO WORK
AT THE DENTAL OFFICE?

06:25.986 --> 06:27.419
OH, I WOULDN'T GO THERE.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.020
WHY NOT?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.589
HANNA, YOU THREATENED A KID
WITH A DRILL BIT.

06:30.591 --> 06:33.258
HE AIMED AT ME
FOR RINSE-AND-SPIT!

06:33.260 --> 06:36.094
LOOK, IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH PLEDGES, YOU CAN SPLIT
SOME OF MY SPONSORSHIP MONEY.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.096
NO. NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

06:38.098 --> 06:41.099
IT'S JUST I'M SAVING UP
FOR SOME EARRINGS.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.167
THEY'RE CRAZY EXPENSIVE.

06:42.169 --> 06:45.337
SO CAN YOU JUST ASK HER?
PLEASE?

06:45.339 --> 06:46.705
SURE, BUT IF I WERE YOU,
I'D KEEP LOOKING.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.513
SURPRISE.

06:55.783 --> 06:59.851
SIMONE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

06:59.853 --> 07:01.686
I WANTED TO SURPRISE YOU.

07:01.688 --> 07:05.724
SHE'S IN TOWN
VISITING HER PARENTS,
SO I HIJACKED HER.

07:05.726 --> 07:08.226
MOM, I DON'T NEED
A BABYSITTER ANYMORE.

07:08.228 --> 07:11.730
NO, BUT MY FIRST PERIOD
ENGLISH CLASS DOES.

07:11.732 --> 07:14.399
YOUR MOM INVITED ME
TO SPEAK TO HER CLASSES.

07:14.401 --> 07:17.803
YOU KNOW,
TRY TO CONVINCE THEM THAT
THERE'S LIFE AFTER ROSEWOOD.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.805
AND IT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY IMPRESSIVE LIFE.

07:19.807 --> 07:21.873
GUESS WHO IS NOW
A PUBLISHED AUTHOR?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.875
WHAT?! THAT'S FANTASTIC!

07:23.877 --> 07:25.310
OKAY, OKAY, SLOW DOWN.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.645
TWO SHORT STORIES
AND AN ONLINE JOURNAL,

07:26.647 --> 07:28.180
AND YOUR MOM THINKS
I'M J.K. ROWLING.

07:28.182 --> 07:30.482
MOM, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SIMONE WAS COMING?

07:30.484 --> 07:32.484
WELL, BECAUSE SOME OF US
CAN KEEP A SECRET.

07:32.486 --> 07:35.287
IT'S<i> SO</i> WEIRD
TO BE BACK IN THIS BUILDING.

07:35.289 --> 07:36.955
I CAME IN AND WENT
RIGHT INTO AUTO-PILOT,

07:36.957 --> 07:38.223
WALKED STRAIGHT
TO MY OLD LOCKER.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.758
OH, DON'T TELL ME YOU MISS IT.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.626
I DO. IT'S TWICE THE SIZE
OF MY APARTMENT IN NEW YORK.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.463
( laughs ) WELL, I MEAN,
DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE
AFTER MY MOM'S CLASS?

07:44.465 --> 07:45.864
YOU SHOULD COME TO MINE, TOO.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.199
HANNA, SPENCER, EMILY--

07:47.201 --> 07:48.867
WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME
ENGLISH CLASS.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.036
OH, WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

07:51.038 --> 07:51.870
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.373
YOUR MOM TELLS ME
THAT YOU KEPT

07:55.375 --> 07:57.709
QUITE AN INTENSE JOURNAL
WHILE YOU WERE AWAY.

07:57.711 --> 08:00.011
YEAH, WELL,
I HAD TO DO SOMETHING.
IT WAS ICELAND.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.681
THE SUN WENT DOWN IN OCTOBER,
AND IT CAME BACK UP IN MARCH.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.484
DON'T DISS IT. THERE MIGHT BE
A REALLY GOOD STORY IN THERE
SOMEWHERE.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.486
NO. NO, I DOUBT IT.

08:07.488 --> 08:10.489
AND WHEN YOU WIN THAT PULITZER,
YOU BETTER THANK ME.

08:10.491 --> 08:13.191
I MADE YOU TURN OFF<i> THE O.C.</i>
AND READ<i> WUTHERING HEIGHTS.</i>

08:13.193 --> 08:15.660
IT WASN'T<i> WUTHERING HEIGHTS,</i>
IT WAS<i> THE EXORCIST.</i>

08:15.662 --> 08:17.562
OKAY, VOLUME.
MOTHER ON CAMPUS.

08:17.564 --> 08:19.564
OKAY, SO WE'RE ALL SET.

08:19.566 --> 08:22.934
MR. FITZ IS IN, AND, SIMONE,
YOU ARE BOOKED TILL LUNCH.

08:22.936 --> 08:25.704
IF YOU HAVE TIME FOR A CUP
OF COFFEE WHILE YOU'RE IN TOWN,

08:25.706 --> 08:27.706
I THINK HE WOULD REALLY LIKE
TO PICK YOUR BRAIN.

08:27.708 --> 08:31.343
SAY YES. HE'S VERY SINGLE
AND VERY HANDSOME.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.346
AM I WRONG?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.853
YES, I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID,
BUT CAN I AT LEAST--

08:41.855 --> 08:44.523
CAN I AT LEAST SAY HELLO TO HER?

08:44.525 --> 08:47.526
HELLO? HELLO?

08:47.528 --> 08:48.760
WAS THAT YOUR MOM?

08:50.664 --> 08:52.797
NO, MAYA'S PRISON GUARD
AT TRUE NORTH.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.299
HOW'S SHE HOLDING UP?

08:54.301 --> 08:56.368
WOULDN'T KNOW.
THEY WON'T LET ME TALK TO HER.

08:56.370 --> 08:59.704
WHY NOT? WHAT DO THEY
HAVE HER DOING OVER THERE
IN THOSE WOODS?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.139
BUILDING A LOG CABIN?

09:01.141 --> 09:02.541
BUILDING CHARACTER.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.976
AND NOW THEY'VE
TAKEN HER PHONE AWAY

09:04.978 --> 09:07.145
AND REPROGRAMMED IT
SO ONLY HER PARENTS CAN CALL.

09:07.147 --> 09:08.847
NO TEXTS, NO EMAILS--
NO NOTHING.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.617
GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.885
WHAT?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.186
GIVE IT TO ME.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.555
YOU'LL GET IT BACK,

09:16.557 --> 09:18.690
AND THEN YOU CAN CALL
YOUR HONEY 24-7.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.263
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

09:25.265 --> 09:26.898
NOT WHAT, WHO.

09:29.236 --> 09:33.104
THAT NEW KID?
I DON'T WANNA GO THERE.
I HEARD HE'S SKETCHY.

09:33.106 --> 09:37.309
SEAN GAVE HIM 20 BUCKS,
HE TOTALLY UPGRADED HIS PHONE--
MORE MEMORY, NEW APPS.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.510
HE'LL HOOK YOU UP.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.478
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.914
EM, HE DOESN'T WANT
A "THANK YOU" CARD,
HE WANTS CASH.

09:51.425 --> 09:52.424
OH. HEY, LUCAS.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.569
WOULDN'T HAVE EVEN
RECOGNIZED HER.

10:04.571 --> 10:07.372
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW SIMONE? HUH?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.874
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

10:09.876 --> 10:14.045
WELL, SHE MUST BE DOING
PRETTY WELL IF SHE'S WILLING
TO SPONSOR ALL FOUR OF US.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.115
COME ON, HAN. YOU CAN LOOK AT
"HELP WANTED" ON THE WAY OVER.

10:17.117 --> 10:19.050
I HEAR ROSEWOOD P.D.
IS HIRING.

10:19.052 --> 10:22.153
WELL, I DO HAVE
EXPERIENCE WITH THEM,
JUST THE WRONG KIND.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.689
OKAY, COME ON, WE HAVE TO GO.
WE ONLY HAVE 45 MINUTES.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.627
WAIT, HOLD ON. WHAT'S THIS?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.831
WHAT AM I LOOKING AT?

10:32.833 --> 10:34.766
HOW COME IT SHOWS
YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY'S ONLINE

10:34.768 --> 10:36.501
WHEN YOUR LAPTOP'S
ON YOUR SHOULDER?

10:36.503 --> 10:39.170
LOOK, ISN'T THAT YOUR PLAYLIST?

10:39.172 --> 10:40.005
WHAT?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.911
WHY ARE YOU CARRYING
A YEARBOOK?

10:46.913 --> 10:48.580
I'M NOT.

10:48.582 --> 10:49.848
WHERE'S YOUR LAPTOP?

10:49.850 --> 10:53.184
IT'S IN MY BAG,
EXCEPT IT'S NOT.

10:53.186 --> 10:57.188
THIS IS INSANE.
THIS BAG HAS BEEN PLASTERED
TO MY SIDE ALL MORNING.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.923
WHAT ABOUT P.E.?

10:58.925 --> 11:01.459
IT WAS IN MY GYM LOCKER,
BUT NO ONE ELSE HAS THAT COMBO.

11:01.461 --> 11:02.694
THE COACHES DO.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.930
IAN MUST'VE HEARD US
LAST NIGHT.

11:05.932 --> 11:07.932
WELL, IF HE DID,
THEN HE KNOWS WHAT'S ON THERE.

11:07.934 --> 11:09.701
IF HE HAS MY LAPTOP...

11:09.703 --> 11:11.870
HE KNOWS WE'VE SEEN
WHAT'S ON THERE, TOO.

11:17.544 --> 11:18.643
( bell jingles )

11:21.715 --> 11:23.548
CALEB, WAIT UP.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.517
DIDN'T YOU SEE ME
WAVE AT YOU?

11:25.519 --> 11:28.353
I SAW YOU.
YOU NEED SOMETHING?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.021
MY PHONE--
IS IT DONE?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.856
DID YOU CRACK THE CODE
OR NOT?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.391
HEY, LET'S DO THIS MONDAY.

11:33.393 --> 11:34.826
YOU SAID IT'D BE READY TODAY.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.461
I SAID I WOULD MAKE IT HAPPEN.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.896
I DON'T GIVE DATES, ALL RIGHT.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.431
YOU WANT SPEEDY DELIVERY,
CALL BEST BUY.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.266
WHAT IF I GIVE YOU
40 MORE BUCKS?

11:41.268 --> 11:42.901
WOULD THAT MAKE IT
HAPPEN ANY FASTER?

11:42.903 --> 11:44.736
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY...

11:44.738 --> 11:45.837
YES.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.940
YO, NOT HERE.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.742
WALK WITH ME.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.913
SO WHAT'S THE RUSH?

11:54.915 --> 11:57.582
I WANNA SPEAK
TO MY FRIEND TONIGHT.

11:57.584 --> 11:59.217
WHERE IS SHE, REHAB?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.553
IT'S NOT REHAB,
IT'S MORE LIKE...

12:01.555 --> 12:04.055
WHO TOLD YOU IT WAS REHAB?

12:04.057 --> 12:05.623
NICE CUSHY TOWN LIKE THIS?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.892
I'M GUESSING REHAD
IS THE NEW BOARDING SCHOOL.

12:07.894 --> 12:08.960
WELL, IT'S NOT.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.161
SHE'S NOT A POTHEAD.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.529
SHE SHOULDN'T EVEN BE THERE.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.433
WHERE DID YOU MOVE HERE FROM?

12:15.435 --> 12:16.868
WHY DO YOU CARE?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.369
WHY CAN'T YOU TELL ME?

12:18.371 --> 12:19.871
I DIDN'T SAY I COULDN'T.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.240
IT JUST MIGHT COST YOU
AN EXTRA 40 BUCKS.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.275
( sighs )
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

12:24.277 --> 12:26.177
I'LL GIVE YOU A DISCOUNT.

12:26.179 --> 12:28.179
YOU CAN HEAR
MY WHOLE LIFE STORY
FOR A CHILI CHEESE DOG.

12:28.181 --> 12:31.783
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME TO EAT.
YOU HAVE A DEADLINE.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.351
I CHEW FAST.

12:36.990 --> 12:40.191
SUSAN, I KNOW YOUR INVENTORY
BACK AND FORTH.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.761
IF YOU COULD JUST
GIVE ME ONE SHOT.

12:42.763 --> 12:45.764
LOOK, I THINK
YOU'RE TERRIFIC, HANNA.

12:45.766 --> 12:48.733
IF IT WERE UP TO ME,
I'D LOVE TO HIRE YOU,

12:48.735 --> 12:50.568
BUT MY BOSS WOULD KILL ME.

12:50.570 --> 12:53.238
WHY?

12:53.240 --> 12:55.306
YOUR MOTHER
OWES US SOME MONEY.

12:57.611 --> 13:00.311
UM, WELL,
MAYBE I COULD WORK IT OFF.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.848
HONEY, THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH
DAYS IN THE WEEK.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.517
I'M SORRY.

13:11.124 --> 13:11.990
( sighs )

13:25.005 --> 13:27.138
HOW'D IT GO?
DID YOU GET IT?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.807
THEY SAID THEY'D CALL.

13:28.809 --> 13:32.210
WELL, SOMEONE'S GOING
TO HIRE YOU EVENTUALLY.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.279
RELAX, IT'S A PAIR OF EARRINGS.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.880
JUST ASK YOUR MOM
FOR A BIGGER ALLOWANCE.

13:35.882 --> 13:37.248
CAN WE JUST GO? PLEASE?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.536
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

13:58.538 --> 14:00.071
NO, NO, I JUST, UH...

14:00.073 --> 14:03.007
I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT WAS IMPULSIVE.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.008
I SHOULD'VE CALLED.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.310
I KNOW THAT'S OUR DEAL,

14:05.312 --> 14:07.345
BUT I JUST FIGURED
IT'S A SATURDAY MORNING,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.547
YOU GOT A STACK
OF PAPERS TO GRADE,

14:09.549 --> 14:12.350
AND WE'RE NOT REALLY
GONNA GET A CHANCE TO TALK
TONIGHT AT THE DANCE.

14:12.352 --> 14:17.355
I WASN'T WORKING.
I WAS ACTUALLY READING
ONE OF SIMONE'S SHORT STORIES.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.357
OH.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.925
HOW IS IT?

14:20.927 --> 14:23.428
IT'S REALLY GOOD.
SHE'S TALENTED.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.563
I FIGURE I SHOULD READ ONE
BEFORE I MEET WITH HER...

14:25.565 --> 14:27.565
FOR COFFEE.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.567
SO YOU'RE MEETING WITH HER NOW?

14:29.569 --> 14:31.035
AT NOON. CRAP.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.372
IT'S 11:30 ALREADY.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.876
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
YOU WERE DOING THIS.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.544
WELL, YOUR MOTHER
WAS PRETTY PERSISTENT,

14:39.546 --> 14:41.880
AND I COULDN'T EXACTLY
TELL HER I WAS SEEING SOMEONE.

14:41.882 --> 14:45.016
OH, OF COURSE.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.484
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS, RIGHT?

14:46.486 --> 14:48.586
YEAH, WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

14:48.588 --> 14:53.458
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD BE SEEN
OUT IN PUBLIC WITH SOMEONE
CLOSER TO YOUR OWN AGE.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.393
IT'S JUST COFFEE, ALL RIGHT.

14:55.395 --> 14:57.095
NO, I KNOW.

14:57.097 --> 15:03.101
SO SHOULD I JUST STAY HERE,
WAIT FOR YOU TILL YOU GET BACK?

15:03.103 --> 15:06.771
I COULD JUST READ
OR CLEAN OUT YOUR REFRIGERATOR.

15:06.773 --> 15:09.140
THERE'S NOTHING IN IT.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.311
WELL, THERE'S THIS.

15:26.960 --> 15:27.992
OH, UH...

15:27.994 --> 15:30.094
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY GO FIRST,

15:30.096 --> 15:31.329
AND I'LL COUNT TO 50.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.479
OH, HEY THERE.

15:48.481 --> 15:49.347
HEY.

15:53.753 --> 15:57.422
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
MY LAPTOP ANYWHERE,
HAVE YOU?

15:57.424 --> 16:00.992
I'VE GOT THIS PAPER DUE MONDAY,
AND I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE.

16:00.994 --> 16:03.928
HMM. I MEAN, YOU HAD IT
THE OTHER NIGHT, RIGHT?

16:03.930 --> 16:06.030
WEREN'T YOU AND YOUR PALS
LOOKING AT IT?

16:06.032 --> 16:07.532
YEAH...

16:07.534 --> 16:11.502
BUT I THOUGHT I BROUGHT IT
WITH ME TO SCHOOL.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.805
BUT YOU BACKUP YOUR FILES,
RIGHT?

16:13.807 --> 16:17.308
YEAH. YEAH, MOST OF IT,
THE IMPORTANT STUFF.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.977
WELL, I HAVEN'T SEEN IT.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.813
MAYBE IT'S IN THE BARN.
YOU'RE WELCOME TO CHECK.

16:21.815 --> 16:22.981
OH, OKAY.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.816
HEY, LISTEN,
DO YOU WANT HALF OF THIS?

16:24.818 --> 16:27.185
WE'RE GONNA NEED PLENTY
OF ENERGY FOR TONIGHT.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.221
WE? YOU'RE GOING TO THE DANCE?

16:30.223 --> 16:31.389
WHY?

16:31.391 --> 16:33.291
WELL, THEY ASKED ME
TO CHAPERONE.

16:33.293 --> 16:35.259
YEAH, IT WAS EITHER THAT
OR SPENDING A NIGHT IN PHILLY

16:35.261 --> 16:36.894
WITH MELISSA AND HER
BUSINESS SCHOOL FRIENDS.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.130
YEAH, SCHOOL DANCE
FELT LESS PAINFUL.

16:39.132 --> 16:40.465
( chuckles )

16:40.467 --> 16:42.467
AND MELISSA IS OKAY WITH THAT?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.936
WELL, YEAH,
SHE KNOWS IT'S NOT MY SCENE.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.170
I'M MORE COMFORTABLE HERE.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.540
OR AT LEAST I USED TO BE.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.380
WHY, WHAT'S CHANGED?

16:55.382 --> 16:58.683
WELL, YOU KNOW HOW IT IS--
SMALL TOWN, PEOPLE GOSSIP.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.321
THEY THINK THEY KNOW YOU,
BUT THEY DON'T.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.223
WHO EXACTLY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

17:07.494 --> 17:10.528
LISTEN, SPENCE, WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE PUT THE PAST BEHIND US?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.930
WE'RE LIVING UNDER
THE SAME ROOF NOW.
LET'S TRY AND BE A FAMILY.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.610
¶¶

17:33.820 --> 17:36.187
YOU SURE YOU WANNA
CHECK YOUR PURSE?

17:36.189 --> 17:37.355
YEAH, WHY NOT?

17:37.357 --> 17:38.756
IT'S SLOSHING.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.858
WHAT DO YOU
HAVE IN THERE ANYWAY?

17:40.860 --> 17:42.360
NOTHING.

17:42.362 --> 17:46.030
I JUST BROUGHT
A LITTLE BEVERAGE

17:46.032 --> 17:48.666
IN CASE THE PUNCH BOWL
HAS NO PUNCH.

17:48.668 --> 17:50.701
YOU BROUGHT A FLASK.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.570
JEEZ, HANNA.

17:52.572 --> 17:54.439
AT LEAST FOLD YOUR
<i> PEOPLE MAGAZINE</i> AROUND IT.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.893
( locks drawer )

18:23.369 --> 18:26.037
¶¶

18:31.511 --> 18:34.378
EXCUSE ME.
BRUCE, HOW ARE YOU?

18:34.380 --> 18:35.713
THANK YOU.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.322
¶¶

18:47.727 --> 18:48.993
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

18:51.498 --> 18:53.764
YOU'RE SURE
YOUR LAPTOP'S IN THAT BAG?

18:53.766 --> 18:55.233
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.501
WHY WOULD HE
BRING IT TO SCHOOL

18:56.503 --> 18:57.969
WHEN HE KNOWS THAT
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE HERE?

18:57.971 --> 18:59.604
MAYBE HE THOUGHT
YOU'D BAIL OUT EARLY,

18:59.606 --> 19:01.272
GO HOME AND SNOOP
THROUGH HIS THINGS.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.273
WHY DON'T YOU?

19:02.275 --> 19:03.274
ALREADY DID.

19:03.276 --> 19:04.775
WE NEED THE BAG.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.410
<i> I KNOW YOU'RE ALL</i>
<i> EAGER TO GET STARTED,</i>

19:06.412 --> 19:08.446
<i> BUT FIRST THE RULES,</i>
<i> ALL RIGHT?</i>

19:08.448 --> 19:10.882
<i> NUMBER ONE--</i>
<i> THERE'S NO STOPPING</i>
<i> DURING THE DANCES.</i>

19:10.884 --> 19:12.283
<i> YOUR CHAPERONES</i>
<i> WILL BE WALKING AROUND,</i>

19:12.285 --> 19:13.451
<i> MAKING SURE</i>
<i> YOU'RE STILL MOVING.</i>

19:13.453 --> 19:15.753
WHAT IF HE ALREADY
ERASED THE VIDEO?

19:15.755 --> 19:18.823
WELL, THEN WE KNOW FOR SURE
HE'S HIDING SOMETHING,
AND WE GO TO THE POLICE.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.191
WITH A NON-VIDEO?

19:20.193 --> 19:21.926
YOU THINK THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT?

19:21.928 --> 19:23.594
LOOK, WE SAW WHAT WE SAW.

19:23.596 --> 19:25.630
SOMETHING WENT DOWN
BETWEEN HIM AND ALISON,

19:25.632 --> 19:28.166
AND HE BURIED HER IN THE YARD
TO SHUT HER UP.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.800
<i> NOW LET'S GET</i>
<i> THIS PARTY STARTED!</i>

19:29.802 --> 19:31.969
¶¶
( cheering and applause )

19:42.916 --> 19:45.616
OH, HEY. I THOUGHT
YOU HAD A FACULTY DINNER.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.718
YEAH, I DID.
IT WRAPPED UP EARLY.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.121
SO I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY
AND LEND A HAND.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.456
IT'S NOT LIKE WE NEED
TO BE AVOIDING EACH OTHER,
RIGHT?

19:52.458 --> 19:54.125
OF COURSE NOT.

19:54.127 --> 19:56.794
ALL RIGHT THEN,
WHERE DO YOU WANT ME, BOSS?

19:56.796 --> 19:59.797
UH, HOW ABOUT
THE SNACK TABLE?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.465
SOLD.

20:01.467 --> 20:04.936
LISTEN, I'VE BEEN A LITTLE
OUT OF THE LOOP THIS WEEK,

20:04.938 --> 20:06.537
WHAT EXACTLY IS A DANCE-A-THON?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.206
WELL, YOU'RE SPONSORING ARIA,
RIGHT?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.674
YEAH, $10 A DANCE.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.842
SO IF SHE MAKES IT
THROUGH 20 DANCES,

20:11.844 --> 20:14.979
YOU NEED TO PONY UP $200
TOWARDS HER CLASS TRIP TO D.C.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.480
Woman: ELLA, WE NEED YOU.

20:16.482 --> 20:19.684
SNACK TABLE'S THAT WAY.
TO BE CONTINUED.

20:19.686 --> 20:20.518
OKAY.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.856
PLEASE TELL ME YOU DID NOT
REQUEST THE BACKSTREET BOYS?

20:25.858 --> 20:28.025
SIMONE.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.860
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:29.862 --> 20:31.529
DO YOU NOT WANT ME HERE?

20:31.531 --> 20:35.566
NO. I MEAN, YES,
OF COURSE I DO.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.402
HERE YOU ARE.
HOW AWESOME IS THAT?

20:38.404 --> 20:40.905
HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING TO THIS.

20:40.907 --> 20:43.641
TWO DAYS IN A ROW?
ARE YOU LIVING IN THAT LOCKER?

20:43.643 --> 20:45.142
( laughs )

20:45.144 --> 20:47.311
EZRA MENTIONED THAT HE
WAS ON THE CHAPERONE SHIFT,

20:47.313 --> 20:48.713
SO I DECIDED TO STOP BY.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.681
OH, SO YOU AND EZRA
HAD A NICE TIME.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.850
HE'S TERRIFIC.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.220
YOU'RE LUCKY. THEY DID NOT HAVE
ENGLISH TEACHERS LIKE THAT
WHEN I WAS HERE.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.891
¶¶

21:03.296 --> 21:05.796
WE'VE GOTTA GET THAT KEY.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.847
¶ I FEEL YOUR TOUCH ¶

21:22.849 --> 21:25.883
¶ YEAH ¶

21:30.356 --> 21:32.290
HEY. DO YOU HAVE IT?
WHERE IS IT?

21:34.994 --> 21:36.761
WAIT, HOW MUCH
DID YOU CHARGE HER?

21:36.763 --> 21:38.262
IT WAS A RUSH JOB.

21:38.264 --> 21:40.131
IF YOU GIVE IT AWAY FOR FREE,
NOBODY WOULD WANT IT.

21:44.704 --> 21:47.104
I THREW IN SOME
EXTRA RINGTONES...
ON THE HOUSE.

21:47.106 --> 21:50.608
WELL, YOU SHOULD,
CONSIDERING YOU CHARGED HER
THREE TIMES THE NORMAL AMOUNT.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.311
THAT PHONE SHOULD ANSWER ITSELF
AND HAVE A BUILT-IN LIPSTICK.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.579
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM?
CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE.

21:55.581 --> 21:58.849
YOU'RE AN ASS, OKAY?
YOU KNEW SHE WAS DESPERATE,
AND YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF HER.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.217
EVER HEARD OF SUPPY AND DEMAND?

22:00.219 --> 22:02.420
OH, ALWAYS WORKING
AN ANGLE, AREN'T YOU?

22:02.422 --> 22:03.988
LIKE YOU'RE NOT.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.823
YOU DON'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING ABOUT ME.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.059
NO, YOU DON'T KNOW
THE FIRST THING ABOUT YOU.

22:14.534 --> 22:16.567
( phone beeps )

22:31.651 --> 22:33.384
¶¶

22:38.591 --> 22:40.825
HEY, HE CHECKED HIS JACKET.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.594
IT'S NUMBER 62,
AND THE KEY RING
IS IN THE POCKET.

22:52.905 --> 22:54.438
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

22:54.440 --> 22:55.940
I FEEL BAD.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.775
NO ONE'S
ASKING LUCAS TO DANCE.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.544
HE'S USED TO IT.
WELL, SO WAS I 40 POUNDS AGO,

23:00.546 --> 23:04.248
BUT YOU WERE NICE ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME FEEL INCLUDED.
NO COMPARISON, YOU WERE SWEET.

23:04.250 --> 23:07.151
THIS KID'S LOOKING TO GET
BITCH SLAPPED EVERY TIME
HE OPENS HIS MOUTH.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.953
HEY, IT'S JUST A DANCE.

23:08.955 --> 23:12.022
YOU WANNA PICK A CHARITY?
SAVE A WHALE.

23:12.024 --> 23:13.357
ONCE DANCE?

23:20.600 --> 23:23.167
READY FOR A DANCE BREAK?
I'M WORKING.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.337
OBAMA WILL STILL BE IN OFFICE
BY THE TIME YOU GET BACK.
COME ON.

23:26.339 --> 23:29.173
I'M SURE
YOU CAN FIND SOMEBODY ELSE
TO STEP ON YOUR FEET.

23:29.175 --> 23:32.176
LUCAS, YOU'VE BEEN TREATING ME
LIKE A BEG BUG FOR WEEKS.

23:32.178 --> 23:34.845
WE CAME HERE FOR A GOOD CAUSE
AND TO HAVE FUN.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.981
WHY CAN'T WE HAVE FUN?
I LOVE THIS SONG.

23:36.983 --> 23:39.150
I HATE THIS SONG.
YOU LOVE THIS SONG.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.518
YOU'RE RIGHT,
I LOVE THIS SONG.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.987
WELL, COME ON,
LET'S BUST A MOVE. LET'S GO.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.889
¶¶

23:47.727 --> 23:49.527
SHOULD I CALL YOU TOMORROW?

23:51.798 --> 23:53.664
SURE.

23:53.666 --> 23:55.166
MAYBE MONDAY?

23:57.136 --> 24:00.438
NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.

24:00.440 --> 24:02.440
OKAY.

24:02.442 --> 24:04.442
I MISS YOU.

24:04.444 --> 24:05.810
BYE.

24:07.814 --> 24:08.946
( phone beeps )

24:08.948 --> 24:10.281
HEY, WAS THAT MAYA?

24:12.518 --> 24:14.552
HOW IS SHE?
AMAZING.

24:14.554 --> 24:16.387
SHE SEEMS REALLY...

24:16.389 --> 24:17.888
HAPPY.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.724
SO WHY DON'T YOU?

24:20.726 --> 24:24.962
ME? NO, I'M--I'M GOOD.
IT'S ALL GOOD.

24:24.964 --> 24:28.499
I'M NOT SENSING GOOD HERE,
EMILY.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.534
WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT HAPPENED?

24:33.339 --> 24:34.472
IT'S JUST WEIRD.

24:37.009 --> 24:41.579
IT WAS LIKE SHE WAS THERE,
BUT SHE WASN'T.

24:41.581 --> 24:42.713
OH, SWEETY.

24:42.715 --> 24:46.217
SHE'S IN WILDERNESS
BOOT CAMP.

24:46.219 --> 24:49.553
YOU KNOW,
SHE'S BEEN TALKING TO BEARS.

24:49.555 --> 24:53.724
AND BESIDES,
I BET HER COUNSELOR WAS PROBABLY
WATCHING HER THE WHOLE TIME.

24:53.726 --> 24:55.326
NO, SHE WAS ALONE.

24:57.430 --> 24:59.163
MAYBE SHE'S MOVED ON.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.705
WHAT MADE YOU CHOOSE PRAGUE?

25:07.707 --> 25:09.974
I FIGURED IF YOU'RE GONNA
SPEND A SEMESTER ABROAD,

25:09.976 --> 25:12.743
YOU MIGHT AS WELL DO IT
WHERE THEY SELL ABSINTHE.

25:12.745 --> 25:15.679
EVER BEEN TO ONE
OF THOSE CRAZY MARIONETTE SHOWS
THEY HAVE OVER THERE?

25:15.681 --> 25:18.115
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
WHY DO YOU THINK
THEY SELL ABSINTHE?

25:18.117 --> 25:19.583
Both: HEY.

25:19.585 --> 25:21.952
UH, DO YOU NEED YOUR JACKET?

25:21.954 --> 25:24.955
YOU'RE NOT PUNKING OUT
ON THE MARATHON ALREADY,
ARE YOU?

25:24.957 --> 25:27.124
OH, TALK ABOUT SOMEBODY
WHO LOVES THEIR PUPPETS.

25:27.126 --> 25:30.561
REMEMBER THAT
HUGE COOKIE MONSTER
YOU HAD ON YOUR BED?

25:30.563 --> 25:32.396
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM EVERY NIGHT.

25:32.398 --> 25:34.899
UH, NO, DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.835
HOW COULD YOU FORGET?
HE HAD TO BE PEELED OFF OF YOU
IN THE MORNING.

25:37.837 --> 25:39.470
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM
IN BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.

25:39.472 --> 25:42.039
ACTUALLY, IT WAS MY ANKLES.

25:42.041 --> 25:45.476
CAN I GET COAT 62?
MY DAD LEFT SOMETHING
IN HIS POCKET.

25:52.285 --> 25:53.150
THANKS.

25:57.957 --> 25:59.356
THANKS.
MM-HMM.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.430
¶¶

26:12.471 --> 26:13.604
Guy: ALL RIGHT.

26:16.342 --> 26:18.809
( song ends )

26:18.811 --> 26:20.511
WAIT.

26:20.513 --> 26:21.579
WHY?

26:21.581 --> 26:23.113
JUST ONE MORE DANCE.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.782
I LIKE THIS SONG, TOO.

26:24.784 --> 26:26.951
YOU CAME HERE WITH SEAN.
REMEMBER HIM?

26:26.953 --> 26:30.554
BIG GUY, LIKES TO HIT ME?

26:30.556 --> 26:33.724
SHH. JUST DANCE.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.693
¶¶

26:35.695 --> 26:40.497
¶ IT MAKES ME WANNA RUN
AS FAST AS MY HEART BEATS ¶

26:43.202 --> 26:45.569
¶ I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES ¶

26:47.640 --> 26:51.875
¶ I SAW IT IN YOUR EYES,
AND NOW IT'S WASHING OVER ME ¶

26:51.877 --> 26:53.877
HEY. WHY AREN'T YOU DANCING?

26:53.879 --> 26:55.446
BATHROOM BREAK.

26:55.448 --> 26:58.682
MOM, HOW LONG DOES SIMONE
PLAN ON STAYING HERE?

26:58.684 --> 27:01.619
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE AND MR. FITZ
SEEM TO BE HITTING IT OFF.

27:01.621 --> 27:04.355
WELL, I THINK SHE'S
MAKING A FOOL OF HERSELF.

27:04.357 --> 27:07.191
WHY, BECAUSE SHE'S
GOING AFTER WHAT SHE WANTS?

27:07.193 --> 27:09.126
SOME MEN FIND THAT APPEALING.

27:13.032 --> 27:16.266
I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

27:16.268 --> 27:17.601
YOU'RE JEALOUS.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.603
WHAT?

27:19.605 --> 27:21.905
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

27:21.907 --> 27:24.408
HONEY,
SHE'S YOUR OLD BABYSITTER,
AND SHE'S YOUR FRIEND,

27:24.410 --> 27:27.211
AND SHE'S SPENDING MORE TIME
WITH MR. FITZ THAN YOU,

27:27.213 --> 27:29.346
BUT, ARIA,
YOU GOTTA CUT HER SOME SLACK.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.548
YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO MEET NICE GUYS.

27:31.550 --> 27:34.318
SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA STRIKE
WHILE THE IRON'S HOT.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.420
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND ONE DAY.

27:40.760 --> 27:44.294
¶ SO AFRAID TO SAY
I'M HAUNTED BY THE MEMORY ¶

27:44.296 --> 27:46.030
¶ OF WHO I WANNA BE ¶

27:47.900 --> 27:51.435
¶ THE FIRE INSIDE IS BURNING OUT
IN FRONT OF ME ¶

27:51.437 --> 27:52.836
¶ I'M OUT OF CONTROL ¶

27:52.838 --> 27:56.640
UM, JUST KEEP DANCING, OKAY?
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

27:56.642 --> 27:58.776
BUT THIS IS A SLOW SONG.

27:58.778 --> 28:00.110
WELL, SWAY.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.311
I'LL JUST BE A SECOND.

28:03.049 --> 28:04.248
WHAT'S UP?
WHAT'S UP?

28:04.250 --> 28:06.417
YOU SAID ONE DANCE.
IT'S BEEN FIVE.

28:06.419 --> 28:08.852
NO, I KNOW,
BUT FOR THE FIRST COUPLE,
WE WERE JUST TALKING,

28:08.854 --> 28:10.688
AND THIS IS THE FIRST ONE
HE'S ACTUALLY GOTTEN INTO.

28:10.690 --> 28:12.089
OH, YEAH,
I KNOW WHAT HE'S INTO.

28:12.091 --> 28:13.757
YOU.
OKAY, STOP.

28:13.759 --> 28:15.926
THIS IS A MARATHON,
NOT A SPRINT.

28:15.928 --> 28:18.028
THERE'LL BE PLENTY
OF DANCES FOR US.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.396
HANNA, I SPENT
MOST OF HOMECOMING

28:19.398 --> 28:20.931
STANDING AROUND
AND WAITING FOR YOU.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.434
DO YOU BRING ME TO THESE THINGS
JUST TO DITCH ME?

28:23.436 --> 28:24.702
( phone beeps )
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

28:24.704 --> 28:26.470
SEAN.
NO, I MEAN IT.

28:26.472 --> 28:28.072
IF YOU'RE TRYING TO PISS ME OFF,
IT'S WORKING.

28:28.074 --> 28:29.473
LOOK, I HAVE TO CHECK THIS.

28:29.475 --> 28:30.808
I'M SORRY, IT'S IMPORTANT.

28:30.810 --> 28:32.209
YEAH.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.343
( sighs )

29:15.221 --> 29:16.620
NEED SOME HELP WITH THAT?

29:23.462 --> 29:25.496
I--I WAS...

29:25.498 --> 29:27.464
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR--

29:27.466 --> 29:29.099
A CHAINSAW?

29:31.137 --> 29:33.337
I CAN PICK THAT FOR YOU
IF YOU WANT.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.841
COULD YOU CLOSE THAT DOOR
PLEASE?

29:37.843 --> 29:40.077
FEELING A DRAFT?

29:40.079 --> 29:43.147
THIS IS WAY TOO COMPLICATED
FOR ME TO EXPLAIN RIGHT NOW.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.815
WHAT'S COMPLICATED?

29:44.817 --> 29:47.351
I DON'T LIVE IN A CAVE,
I GET IT.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.554
THE RICH GIRLS STEAL,
THE PRETTY GIRLS LIE,
THE SMART GIRLS PLAY DUMB,

29:50.556 --> 29:53.724
AND THE DUMB GIRLS
SPEND THEIR DAYS TRYING TO BE
ALL OF THE ABOVE.

29:53.726 --> 29:56.393
HOW MUCH WILL IT COST
TO MAKE YOU FORGET
THAT YOU WALKED IN HERE?

30:00.699 --> 30:01.999
¶¶

30:02.001 --> 30:05.536
WELL, FOUR HOURS DOWN,
TWO TO GO.

30:05.538 --> 30:07.838
DID YOU ASK HIM TO PLAY THIS?

30:07.840 --> 30:10.174
NO, I WISH THAT I HAD, THOUGH.

30:10.176 --> 30:14.945
LISTEN,
AS LONG AS IT'S PLAYING...

30:14.947 --> 30:19.850
( both chuckle )

30:19.852 --> 30:24.388
WE SHOULD TAKE SIMONE OUT
TO THAT LITTLE PIZZA JOINT
WE USED TO LOVE.

30:24.390 --> 30:28.559
YOU, ME, THE KIDS--
IT'LL BE LIKE OLD TIMES.

30:28.561 --> 30:30.060
IT'S STILL THERE.

30:30.062 --> 30:32.062
OH, NO, I KNOW,

30:32.064 --> 30:35.232
AND THE KIDS WOULD PROBABLY
REALLY ENJOY THAT.

30:35.234 --> 30:38.435
I'M JUST NOT SO SURE
I NEED TO BE THERE.

30:38.437 --> 30:39.937
HMM.

30:39.939 --> 30:43.607
BUT THEN IT WOULDN'T BE
LIKE OLD TIMES, WOULD IT?

30:43.609 --> 30:45.776
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:45.778 --> 30:47.911
IT WOULD BE LIKE NEW TIMES.

30:51.517 --> 30:54.084
IT'S JUST...
IT'S JUST A PIZZA, ELLA.

30:56.355 --> 30:58.822
YEAH, BUT IT COMES
WITH A LOT OF TOPPINGS.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.294
LET'S NOT CONFUSE THINGS
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?

31:04.296 --> 31:05.762
LET'S JUST DANCE.

31:05.764 --> 31:07.798
¶¶

31:26.819 --> 31:28.819
¶¶

31:32.491 --> 31:35.525
SO THEN I COULDN'T
GET INTO THE DRAWER.
NONE OF THE KEYS WORKED.

31:35.527 --> 31:39.029
WHAT DID THIS KID SEE?
DID YOU HAVE TO PAY HIM OFF
OR SOMETHING?

31:39.031 --> 31:42.699
NO, HE WOULDN'T TAKE ANY MONEY,
BUT I THINK HE'LL KEEP
HIS MOUTH SHUT.

31:42.701 --> 31:46.470
IT'S NOT LIKE HE DOESN'T
HAVE PLENTY TO HIDE, RIGHT?
ARIA?

31:46.472 --> 31:49.539
THAT IS IT! I WILL KICK HER
BACK TO NEW YORK IF I HAVE TO!

31:49.541 --> 31:51.308
WAIT, ARIA, STOP,
BEFORE YOU DO
SOMETHING YOU REGRET.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.709
SPENCE, LET GO OF ME.

31:52.711 --> 31:54.444
I'D BE HAPPY TO PASS
YOUR STUFF ALONG.

31:54.446 --> 31:56.647
REALLY?
MM-HMM, SURE.

31:56.649 --> 31:59.983
MY EDITOR IS COMING OVER
FOR A DRINK NEXT WEEKEND.
YOU SHOULD JOIN US.

31:59.985 --> 32:02.753
THERE ARE TEACHERS HERE
AND PARENTS--YOUR PARENTS!

32:02.755 --> 32:03.921
I DON'T CARE!

32:03.923 --> 32:05.455
IT'S JUST A TRAIN RIDE AWAY

32:05.457 --> 32:07.224
AND A 15-MINUTE WALK
FROM PENN STATION.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.760
WE NEED TO TALK.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:09.762 --> 32:11.428
MR. FITZ...

32:11.430 --> 32:13.597
WILL YOU DANCE WITH ME?
WHAT?

32:13.599 --> 32:15.699
WE'RE ALLOWED. COME ON.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.467
WOW.

32:17.469 --> 32:20.137
SOMEONE'S CRUSHING
ON HER ENGLISH TEACHER.

32:20.139 --> 32:22.706
( chuckles )

32:22.708 --> 32:24.241
¶¶

32:34.286 --> 32:36.820
MY FEET HURT.
MY BRAIN HURTS.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.155
EVERYTHING HURTS.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.256
SCOOT OVER.

32:43.395 --> 32:44.494
HEY, WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?

32:47.399 --> 32:48.765
THIS IS MINE.

32:48.767 --> 32:50.667
I HELPED MYSELF.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.338
TO ALL OF IT?

32:54.340 --> 32:57.007
WHY ARE YOU DANCING
WITH LUCAS?

32:57.009 --> 32:59.009
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:59.011 --> 33:00.644
YOU'RE TORTURING HIM.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.447
YOU KNOW HE WORSHIPS YOU,

33:03.449 --> 33:05.582
AND YOU'RE NEVER GONNA
LOOK AT HIM THAT WAY.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.017
I ALREADY FEEL LIKE CRAP, OKAY?

33:07.019 --> 33:08.618
SO IF YOU'RE
GONNA PILE IT ON,

33:08.620 --> 33:10.454
YOU COULD'VE AT LEAST
SAVED ME A SIP.

33:10.456 --> 33:12.990
ALISON
DID THE SAME THING TO ME.

33:12.992 --> 33:16.093
MAKES YOU FEEL POWERFUL, HUH?

33:16.095 --> 33:17.627
NO.

33:19.665 --> 33:22.032
JUST THE OPPOSITE.

33:22.034 --> 33:25.635
IT'S TOO BAD
SHE'S NOT HERE TONIGHT.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.804
ALISON WOULD'VE BEEN
REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

33:35.080 --> 33:37.547
( phone beeps )

33:43.622 --> 33:45.822
( sighs )

33:45.824 --> 33:47.457
¶¶

33:52.698 --> 33:54.564
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT ABOUT?

33:54.566 --> 33:56.366
SAVING YOUR RELATIONSHIP.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.202
FIVE MORE SECONDS,
AND YOU WOULD'VE
ENDED UP ON YOUTUBE.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.538
THAT WAS A SUICIDE MISSION,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.173
¶¶

34:10.916 --> 34:14.818
LOOK, HANNA, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO LOSE IT.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.687
LET'S JUST FORGET IT
AND DANCE, OKAY?

34:17.689 --> 34:20.524
LOOK, I--I CAN'T.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.025
CAN'T OR WON'T?

34:23.929 --> 34:26.096
LOOK, I HAVE TO DANCE
WITH LUCAS.

34:26.098 --> 34:29.199
PLEASE DON'T ASK WHY.

34:29.201 --> 34:31.668
JUST LET ME DANCE WITH HIM.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.938
OH. OKAY, SURE.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:34.940 --> 34:36.807
YOU CAN DO MORE
THAN DANCE WITH HIM.

34:36.809 --> 34:39.276
YOU CAN LEAVE WITH HIM, TOO.

34:39.278 --> 34:41.178
NO, SEAN, PLEASE.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.715
THAT CAR
BROKE MORE THAN YOUR LEGS.

34:45.717 --> 34:47.784
THERE'S SOMETHING REALLY SICK
GOING ON UP THERE.

34:49.988 --> 34:50.921
WE'RE OVER.

34:54.526 --> 35:00.997
¶ YOU KNOW I'D DO
ANYTHING FOR YOU ¶

35:00.999 --> 35:03.667
HEY.

35:03.669 --> 35:05.435
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

35:10.442 --> 35:13.143
DO YOU WANNA GO
OUTSIDE AND TALK?

35:13.145 --> 35:15.512
NO, JUST DANCE WITH ME.

35:15.514 --> 35:20.217
¶ I DON'T WANNA LOSE
YOUR LOVE TONIGHT ¶

35:26.792 --> 35:31.561
¶ TRY TO STOP
MY HANDS FROM SHAKING ¶

35:31.563 --> 35:33.029
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH EMILY?

35:35.567 --> 35:37.434
( sighs )

35:40.305 --> 35:42.672
HEY.
HEY.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.107
WHOA.
OKAY.

35:44.109 --> 35:47.077
COME ON. HEY, SIT DOWN.

35:47.079 --> 35:49.079
OKAY, I'M GONNA GO
GET YOU SOME WATER.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.113
CAFFEINATED WATER.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.816
I'M NOT THIRSTY.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.652
HE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.989
HE'S NOT A CHAPERONE.
HE'S A KILLER.

35:58.991 --> 36:00.190
EMILY.

36:00.192 --> 36:02.859
WHY IS TOBY AT HOME
WEARING A LOJACK,

36:02.861 --> 36:05.695
WHILE THIS FREAK
CAN GO ANYWHERE HE WANTS,

36:05.697 --> 36:07.364
DO WHATEVER HE WANTS...
EMILY--

36:07.366 --> 36:09.166
MARRY<i> YOUR</i> SISTER?!

36:09.168 --> 36:10.667
OKAY, EMILY, WITH US.
COME ON.

36:17.109 --> 36:19.743
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID--
WE ALL KNOW--

36:19.745 --> 36:21.444
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET AWAY WITH IT.

36:21.446 --> 36:22.279
EMILY.

36:24.149 --> 36:25.849
ARIA CAN HANDLE THAT.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.584
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

36:27.586 --> 36:30.520
YOU AND I ARE GONNA DANCE.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.023
WHAT WAS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

36:33.025 --> 36:35.091
I--I DON'T KNOW.

36:35.093 --> 36:37.093
AND I THINK YOU DO.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.634
SHE KNOWS ABOUT US.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.636
SHE KNOWS WE KISSED
LAST SUMMER.

36:46.638 --> 36:49.773
WELL, I THOUGHT WE AGREED
WE WERE GONNA KEEP THAT
A SECRET.

36:49.775 --> 36:52.142
WHO ELSE KNOWS BESIDES
YOUR LITTLE FRIENDS?

36:52.144 --> 36:52.943
NO ONE.

36:55.480 --> 36:57.347
THAT BETTER BE THE TRUTH...

36:57.349 --> 36:58.615
OR SOMEONE'S GONNA GET HURT.

37:09.528 --> 37:11.394
WAS THAT TREE ALWAYS HERE?

37:11.396 --> 37:14.464
( sighs ) HERE, TAKE THESE.
SHE'S NOT DRIVING.

37:14.466 --> 37:16.266
NO, I'M NOT TAKING HER HOME.

37:16.268 --> 37:17.901
IF HER MOM FINDS OUT
IT WAS MY FLASK,

37:17.903 --> 37:19.336
I'M GONNA BE FEEDING
THE BEARS WITH MAYA.

37:19.338 --> 37:20.604
FINE, I'LL DRIVE HER.

37:20.606 --> 37:23.873
NO, I'M<i> NOT</i> GOING HOME.

37:23.875 --> 37:26.543
JUST CRASH
AT MY PLACE THEN, OKAY?

37:26.545 --> 37:27.944
YOU, TOO.

37:27.946 --> 37:30.313
I DON'T WANNA BE HOME ALONE
WHEN IAN WALKS IN.

37:30.315 --> 37:32.115
OKAY.

37:32.117 --> 37:33.316
HANNA.

37:37.889 --> 37:39.356
CAN I TAKE YOU HOME?

37:41.393 --> 37:43.827
IAN, I KINDA PROMISED THEM--

37:43.829 --> 37:46.830
LOOK...

37:46.832 --> 37:51.935
I KNOW SEAN TOOK OFF,

37:51.937 --> 37:58.208
AND I WAS THINKING THAT
SINCE YOU GUYS WERE NOW OVER...

37:58.210 --> 38:01.077
I CAN OPEN MY OWN DAMN DOOR.

38:03.515 --> 38:07.550
LUCAS, IT'S REALLY,
REALLY SWEET OF YOU TO OFFER,

38:07.552 --> 38:10.387
BUT EMILY'S KIND OF...

38:10.389 --> 38:13.256
SHE NEEDS ME RIGHT NOW,

38:13.258 --> 38:16.626
AND I ALREADY TOLD SPENCER
I'D GO WITH THEM, SO...

38:19.831 --> 38:20.697
OKAY.

38:44.890 --> 38:48.391
IF YOU WANT,
YOU SHOULD JUST
LEAVE WITH SIMONE.

38:48.393 --> 38:50.193
TAKE HER HOME TO NEW YORK.

38:50.195 --> 38:52.228
WHY WOULD YOU THINK I'D WANT --

38:52.230 --> 38:53.963
WELL, WHY WOULDN'T YOU?

38:53.965 --> 38:57.434
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
AND SHE'S SMART AND FUNNY.

38:57.436 --> 38:58.868
I MET HER YESTERDAY.

38:58.870 --> 39:02.072
SHE'S SUCCESSFUL.
YOU LOVE HER WRITING.

39:02.074 --> 39:03.840
SHE'S YOUR AGE.

39:03.842 --> 39:05.975
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T COMPETE WITH THAT.

39:05.977 --> 39:07.977
NOBODY'S ASKING YOU TO.

39:07.979 --> 39:11.981
YEAH, BUT IT'S TRUE.
YOU TWO EVEN LOOK LIKE
A COUPLE.

39:11.983 --> 39:18.588
YOU CAN DANCE WITH HER
AND HOLD HER HAND
IN FRONT OF OTHER PEOPLE,

39:18.590 --> 39:23.159
LEAVE YOUR APARTMENT
AT THE SAME TIME
WITHOUT HAVING TO COUNT TO 50.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.828
ARIA...

39:24.830 --> 39:27.163
WHY ARE WE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION?

39:27.165 --> 39:28.798
I'M...

39:31.436 --> 39:34.371
I AM ALREADY IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.112
( people laughing )

39:57.162 --> 39:58.194
( phone beeps )

39:58.196 --> 39:59.195
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

39:59.197 --> 40:00.597
MAYA.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.234
GIVE IT BACK.

40:04.236 --> 40:06.369
FRIENDS DON'T LET
FRIENDS DIAL DRUNK.

40:06.371 --> 40:08.004
YOU'LL THANK ME TOMORROW...

40:08.006 --> 40:10.206
IF YOU CAN REMEMBER MY NAME.

40:10.208 --> 40:13.243
NOW, SIT, LIE, SLEEP.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.149
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING,
WE'LL BE RIGHT DOWNSTAIRS.

40:22.721 --> 40:26.222
HANNA...

40:26.224 --> 40:30.727
THOSE THINGS I SAID TO YOU
IN THE COURTYARD...

40:30.729 --> 40:33.430
DON'T APOLOGIZE.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

40:37.369 --> 40:42.572
THE TRUTH IS, I WAS WORSE
THAN ALISON TONIGHT,

40:42.574 --> 40:44.741
IF THAT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

40:48.346 --> 40:52.382
AND I DO KNOW HOW
LUCAS FEELS ABOUT ME.

40:52.384 --> 40:56.052
I WASN'T MESSING WITH HIM
FOR FUN. I HAD TO.

40:59.825 --> 41:01.090
( sighs )

41:06.064 --> 41:07.330
( sighs )

41:47.806 --> 41:49.506
HEY, HOW IS SHE?

41:49.508 --> 41:52.408
PASSED OUT.
SHE WANTED TO CALL MAYA,
SO I TOOK HER PHONE.

41:52.410 --> 41:55.111
SMART, THAT COULD CAUSE
SOME SERIOUS DAMAGE.

41:58.850 --> 41:59.782
SPENCE?

42:01.253 --> 42:03.453
WAS THIS ALWAYS SITTING HERE?

42:03.455 --> 42:04.787
NO.

42:04.789 --> 42:07.457
IAN MUST HAVE PUT IT BACK
BEFORE THE DANCE.

42:07.459 --> 42:09.726
WELL, THEN WHY
DIDN'T YOU NOTICE IT?

42:09.728 --> 42:12.729
HE LEFT AFTER ME.

42:12.731 --> 42:15.331
( sighs )
THE VIDEO'S GONE,

42:15.333 --> 42:17.166
AND THE TRASH HAS BEEN WIPED.

42:17.168 --> 42:19.168
SURPRISE, SURPRISE.

42:21.306 --> 42:23.339
OH, MY GOD.
IT'S ALI.

42:23.341 --> 42:24.607
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

42:24.609 --> 42:28.311
"WATCH YOUR BACKS.
I DIDN'T. A."

42:28.313 --> 42:31.948
THAT WAS TAKEN IN YOUR YARD
THE NIGHT SHE DISAPPEARED.
SHE'S WEARING THE YELLOW TOP.

42:31.950 --> 42:35.285
THERE'S A SHADOW RIGHT THERE
LIKE SOMEONE WAS FOLLOWING HER.

42:35.287 --> 42:38.621
SPENCE, YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?

42:38.623 --> 42:41.324
I--I HAVE NO IDEA.

42:56.474 --> 42:59.108
HERE YOU GO.
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING?

42:59.110 --> 43:00.076
OKAY. BYE.

43:01.346 --> 43:04.614
HI. NUMBER 32 COMING RIGHT UP.

43:08.820 --> 43:09.953
HERE YOU GO.

43:12.324 --> 43:14.257
HOPE YOU HAD
A GOOD TIME TONIGHT.
