WEBVTT

00:00.084 --> 00:02.043
There's like this circle of trust.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.088
And you're way on the outside of it.

00:05.214 --> 00:06.673
Lieutenant, send me down.

00:08.967 --> 00:11.302
You look like the kind of firefighter
we want here at 51.

00:12.304 --> 00:13.721
Keeler's still out there somewhere.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.223
He ain't out there anymore, Otis.

00:15.349 --> 00:18.101
Gabriela Dawson.
I'm dispatcher Ramsey.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.560
I'm here for that beer you owe me.

00:22.523 --> 00:24.774
Would you want your only daughter
to be a firefighter?

00:24.900 --> 00:27.318
Give her the boot.
She's moving over to headquarters.

00:28.737 --> 00:32.156
- Seriously, it'll be great.
- Oh yeah. Great, just great.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.825
What's up?

00:34.868 --> 00:37.745
Mouch got a "Dear John"
letter from Mari in Japan.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.790
- It's over.
- They were still together?

00:42.459 --> 00:43.543
Serves me right.

00:43.669 --> 00:47.588
Thinking I could make it work
when we were 6,200 miles apart.

00:48.507 --> 00:51.342
Apparently the new guy
is a game show host.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.679
How am I supposed
to compete with that?

00:58.517 --> 00:59.809
Hey.

01:03.480 --> 01:07.275
You'll rally, Mouch.
I know you will.

01:13.115 --> 01:15.241
Even I could have
done better than that.

01:15.993 --> 01:17.869
It was good advice.

01:20.456 --> 01:23.958
Thank you. It's not mine.

01:27.755 --> 01:30.214
- Lindsay? The detective chick?
- Yeah.

01:31.967 --> 01:34.927
Why don't you answer? Maybe she's
calling about Keeler's disappearance.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.095
The case is closed.

01:36.221 --> 01:38.139
Well, maybe she's calling
on a more social level.

01:38.265 --> 01:41.184
I like that girl for you.
She's got swagger, that husky voice.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.560
You going to call her back?

01:42.686 --> 01:45.646
I don't know. Maybe.
If she plays her cards right.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.733
Listen to you.

01:53.197 --> 01:54.739
Come on, Pouch.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.949
Oh! Come on, come on,
yeah, come on.

01:57.075 --> 01:58.534
She was howling at the TV
the other day.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.411
I was the only one here
and nobody believes me.

02:00.537 --> 02:04.248
Oh, I was, uh,
I was letting that finish.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.375
Oh, it's almost done.
Hey, I've been meaning to ask,

02:06.502 --> 02:08.920
are you going to re-take the test,
now that the foot's better?

02:09.046 --> 02:12.089
Yeah, I just actually signed up for a
couple training sessions at the Academy

02:12.216 --> 02:13.424
to get ready for the physical.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.926
Good luck.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.474
- You two warming up?
- No.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.184
But I still think it's wrong

02:23.310 --> 02:25.269
that she has no idea
you're going to sideline her.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.606
I wish there was something
I could do about that, but I told you

02:28.732 --> 02:30.608
her dad is too far up
the food chain.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.068
Mm-hmm.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.946
What does that mean?

02:36.657 --> 02:40.159
It means you are
the most amazing man I know.

02:40.285 --> 02:41.536
Mmm.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.622
I've seen you handle far tougher
obstacles than a man in a white shirt.

02:46.416 --> 02:47.917
Where's Clarke today?

02:48.043 --> 02:51.087
Uh, he switched out a few shifts
for some army buddy's wedding.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.713
- He'll be back in a week.
- A week?

02:52.840 --> 02:55.091
Seems like a long time to sub out.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.889
Jones, look, Clarke is a great guy.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.851
And I say this from experience,
you don't want to get involved

03:04.977 --> 03:07.395
with someone in house.
Especially when you're new.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.480
Who said anything
about getting involved?

03:10.440 --> 03:11.607
I'm just
trying to help.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.568
Well, give me
a little more credit than that.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.823
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad three...

03:18.949 --> 03:23.369
Ambulance 61,
house fire at 6200, 47th Street.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.170
Main to 61.

03:33.297 --> 03:36.299
Victor Ramsey on dispatch. Again.

03:36.425 --> 03:37.717
Go ahead, Main.

03:37.843 --> 03:41.137
State's backed up this morning,
I'd take Racine down to 47th.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.513
Thanks, Ramsey.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.640
You've been working the same shifts
we have lately.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.935
Yep. Great to see you
at Molly's the other night.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.063
We should do it again soon.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.066
Let's keep it professional, OK, Ramsey?

03:54.192 --> 03:55.651
Just trying to help you, Dawson.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.239
Appreciate that.
Thanks for the traffic tip.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.868
Something is not right with that guy.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.879
Two-story residence, fully involved.

04:15.005 --> 04:18.007
Hurry, you've got to help them!
The Brookers live on the second floor.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.843
They have three little kids.
I heard them calling out.

04:20.969 --> 04:24.722
OK, we have a report of three children
in the second floor apartment,

04:24.848 --> 04:26.766
looks like the parents
are likely with them.

04:26.892 --> 04:29.560
Cruz, Otis, up the aerial to vent!

04:29.686 --> 04:31.812
Herrmann and Mouch,
primary search with me.

04:31.939 --> 04:34.774
Five possible victims. Mills and me
will go with you on search.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.442
Capp! Grab a second
line from the engine,

04:36.568 --> 04:39.403
and inch it through
the front door. Let's go!

04:52.167 --> 04:53.709
Herrmann, set the bar.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.421
Strike. Strike.

05:01.468 --> 05:03.719
Hey, Casey!
We'll take the east side.

05:03.845 --> 05:06.347
Copy. We'll take
the west side of the hall.

05:06.473 --> 05:09.517
Hey, Capp, get a line
down this hall and cover us.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.726
Got it!

05:13.772 --> 05:16.399
Fire Department, call out.

05:23.115 --> 05:24.615
I got one.

05:30.455 --> 05:31.580
I got a kid here.

05:31.707 --> 05:35.292
I need back up in the bedroom,
west end of the hall, now!

05:38.505 --> 05:39.964
Let's roll him.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.301
Oh, my God!
They're all here!

05:45.846 --> 05:47.847
They're all moving!

06:01.820 --> 06:02.903
Hold on, buddy.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.924
Let's go. Come on.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.384
Watch it. Watch it.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.555
He hasn't moved.

06:35.228 --> 06:37.563
I can't get a pulse.
Let's put him on the monitor.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.655
He piled up his whole family
in that corner bedroom, Chief.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.992
Laid on top of them.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.501
Where's my daddy?

07:01.129 --> 07:03.005
All right.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.351
He's asystole.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.464
- Casey.
- Let him try. Let him try.

07:45.590 --> 07:46.674
Come on!

07:52.139 --> 07:53.430
Come on!

07:56.518 --> 07:58.185
Come on.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.647
Let's call it.

08:03.692 --> 08:05.442
Anyone disagree?

08:15.871 --> 08:17.496
Then I'm calling it.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.170
I could really use a beer right now.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.506
Or something stronger.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.429
Ever seen anything like that before?

09:16.681 --> 09:21.477
A guy lying on top of
his family like a shield?

09:22.896 --> 09:24.104
No.

09:27.901 --> 09:31.403
Hey, who wants to play some Spit?
Jonesie?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.864
No?

09:35.242 --> 09:37.993
Ah, great. Just great.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.538
Now you're going to get upset
every time you see an Asian lady?

09:41.665 --> 09:44.083
Excuse me for having
a broken heart.

09:44.209 --> 09:47.378
I'm in for Spit, if you can do it
without cheating.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.505
I don't know what
you're talking about.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.298
Oh, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

09:53.343 --> 09:54.718
Hey, you OK?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.138
Fine, yeah...

10:01.768 --> 10:03.894
Hey, babe. Check it out.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.105
Great apartment, outdoor space.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.356
Oh, wow.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.733
Cool, look at
the grill right here.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.110
I think we just found our place.

10:13.196 --> 10:16.407
Hey, we really got to get a move
on this apartment thing.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.284
We've been talking
about it for months.

10:18.410 --> 10:22.663
I know. If we could find
a place like that I would jump.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.373
Must be nice.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.583
A lieutenant's salary.
Two bedrooms...

10:27.752 --> 10:32.673
Wait, you thought we were going
to live in a one-bedroom apartment?

10:33.883 --> 10:36.510
- Yeah.
- Dude, are you insane?

10:43.518 --> 10:45.311
Uh, got a favor to ask.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.105
Mmm-hmm. Sure. Shoot.

10:48.231 --> 10:53.110
Uh, I, um, recently overheard
you helping Clarke out

10:53.236 --> 10:56.447
with his, uh, romantic life.
And, uh...

10:56.573 --> 10:57.656
Mmm. Mmm-hmm.

10:57.782 --> 11:02.244
I was wondering if you could
help me in that department?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.039
Let me put some thought into it,

11:05.165 --> 11:08.876
um, but I got to get
the rig cleaned up.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.796
OK.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.014
Oh...

11:23.516 --> 11:25.017
So, if I ask you how you're doing,

11:25.143 --> 11:26.810
are you going to tell me
you're fine again?

11:26.936 --> 11:29.271
I mean, just give me a heads up.
I don't want to waste my breath.

11:30.565 --> 11:31.982
I'm just trying to bury it.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.318
That's what we do, right?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.404
Make jokes, get over it?

11:42.452 --> 11:44.620
You know, I spent my
whole life watching my dad.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.208
Dreaming about what it'd be like
fighting fires.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.293
Saving people.

11:53.338 --> 11:56.632
Yeah. I mean, I don't mean to wallow.
I hate wallowers.

11:56.758 --> 11:59.593
Look, Jones, I've been there.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.721
Those first few calls,

12:02.847 --> 12:06.475
when it hits you that you're
not going to save everyone,

12:06.601 --> 12:10.145
that someone's going to die
on your watch no matter what you do.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.232
I didn't take it easy, either.
Trust me.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.319
Yeah. Maybe I'm just
not cut out for this.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.614
Maybe not.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.326
I'm not saying that I know.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.038
But it's not about how you feel
right now.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.374
It's about how you move on.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.422
- Make jokes, get over it.
- Oh, whatever it takes.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.884
Look, we've got two great lieutenants
here at 51

12:41.010 --> 12:44.430
and my advice is that
you should follow their lead.

12:54.566 --> 12:57.276
Jones was pretty shaken up
on that call this morning, huh?

12:57.402 --> 13:00.529
Yeah. Maybe she's not the ice queen
I thought she was.

13:00.655 --> 13:02.990
I wouldn't go that far.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.453
What the hell?
What is that?

13:07.579 --> 13:09.413
Do not tell me that's a mouse!

13:11.332 --> 13:14.501
Let me see. It's not alive,
whatever it is.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.503
Come on, be careful.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.049
The little girl
that Herrmann carried,

13:21.176 --> 13:23.760
she was holding this
when they brought her over to our rig.

13:24.679 --> 13:26.263
She must've dropped it.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.141
Main to 61.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.689
Main to 61.

13:37.901 --> 13:40.986
This is 61, what's up, Main?

13:41.112 --> 13:42.779
Took a while for 61 to get back

13:42.906 --> 13:45.616
after you dropped the girl
at Chicago Med, you OK?

13:45.742 --> 13:47.743
How does he
know how long it took us?

13:51.372 --> 13:53.749
Ramsey, I said I wanted
to keep it focused on work.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.709
Not comfortable with
the personal questions.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.128
Copy that. My bad.

13:59.422 --> 14:01.173
Good for you.
That'll teach him to shut up.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.011
It's not for me.
Never for me anymore.

14:06.137 --> 14:09.348
Oh, it could be my
Academy trainer. Hello?

14:09.474 --> 14:11.808
Gabby, how could
you do that to me?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.186
Ramsey?

14:16.105 --> 14:20.359
You and me, we're connected
in ways you don't understand.

14:25.865 --> 14:28.659
That was creepy.
Calling from inside the house creepy.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.118
I'll take care of it.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.162
OK, you guys are
not going to believe this.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.830
So, this guy...

14:33.957 --> 14:36.959
We found the little girl's
stuffed animal from 47th Street.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.462
I thought maybe we could clean it up
and send it over to the hospital.

14:40.588 --> 14:43.257
Yeah, I can do a run,
see how they're doing.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.758
Great.

14:45.760 --> 14:47.052
I'll come with.

14:48.012 --> 14:49.638
All right, I'll clean it.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.600
Why didn't you tell Casey
what happened with the dispatcher?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.061
Uh, it's been a rough day, so I'm
just going to file a complaint

14:56.187 --> 14:58.772
with the OEMC.
That should take care of it.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.817
Yeah, it sounds good.
But is everything OK with Casey?

15:01.943 --> 15:03.610
Yeah. No, no,
it's not a big deal.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.238
I just don't want him to do
that whole protective boyfriend thing.

15:06.364 --> 15:07.698
- You know?
- Oh, yeah.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.366
But you know what would be great,

15:09.492 --> 15:11.493
is if we did that girls' weekend
we talked about.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.453
Just you and me and a few days
away from all this.

15:13.580 --> 15:17.457
Yes. Yeah, absolutely.
Let's do it.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.214
- How's the family doing now?
- Physically they're fine.

15:24.340 --> 15:26.216
Uh, Mrs. Brooker
was released last night,

15:26.342 --> 15:27.801
but she stayed here with the kids.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.428
Their CO2 levels are stable,

15:29.554 --> 15:31.680
so they're going to be going home
before the end of today.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.640
- That's great to hear.
- Dr Willhite.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.517
Orthopedics posted the Campbell X-rays.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.810
Oh, thanks.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.605
We won't take up any more
of your time.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.523
Medics found this
in the back of the ambulance.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.734
- It belongs to the little girl.
- Caroline.

15:43.860 --> 15:49.072
Let me tell Mrs. Brooker you're here,
maybe you can bring it back to her.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.490
Yeah. Sure.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.458
I'm sorry, but
Mrs. Brooker feels...

15:59.584 --> 16:00.959
Are you the ones who were there?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.754
- Yeah.
- How can you come here?

16:03.880 --> 16:07.716
If you'd gotten us out sooner,
my children would still have a father.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.718
Ma'am, we're very
sorry for your loss.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.099
I'll bring this to Caroline.
I don't want you near her.

16:24.359 --> 16:24.399
Uh, the family's doing
well, physically.

16:24.400 --> 16:27.486
Uh, the family's doing
well, physically.

16:27.612 --> 16:29.780
But, the mother's pretty shaken.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.406
Understandable.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.827
Listen, if you have a sec,
Chief, I...

16:35.953 --> 16:38.372
I wanted to talk to
you about Jones.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.834
What's on your mind?

16:42.960 --> 16:47.005
Are we really going to ding her
because her father wants us to?

16:47.131 --> 16:49.424
I'm having a hard time with this.

16:49.550 --> 16:52.886
Chief Jones put us
in an untenable position.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.680
And I really wish he hadn't.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.523
- Hello.
- Mouch! Hi.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.693
You avoided me all last shift.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.363
- I wasn't avoiding you.
- Yes, you were.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.825
You think I'm a lost cause
when it comes to women.

17:14.951 --> 17:19.413
What? Not at all.
I, um, honestly,

17:19.539 --> 17:21.581
I don't think I'd do
a very good job at it, you know?

17:21.708 --> 17:24.751
I mean, we don't really
know each other all that well.

17:24.877 --> 17:30.090
OK, well, ask away. I'm an open book.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.427
Um, what's your prototype?

17:33.553 --> 17:36.513
You know, like,
your perfect woman?

17:36.639 --> 17:39.599
I mean, I know she's currently involved,
so I would never act on this,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.560
but, uh, Dawson.

17:43.813 --> 17:46.356
- Dawson.
- Yes.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.823
Truck 81, Squad three,
Ambulance 61, multi-vehicle...

18:09.088 --> 18:11.465
- Thank God you're here.
- Are you hurt?

18:11.591 --> 18:14.092
I got a flat, pulled over
and this gentleman stopped to help me.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.636
But then this van came speeding by
and smashed into his truck.

18:16.763 --> 18:17.763
The driver just took off!

18:17.889 --> 18:20.140
Where's the guy that stopped
to help you?

18:23.644 --> 18:26.605
Squad, get airbags and cribbing
under there, right now.

18:26.731 --> 18:29.566
We need to stabilize that car
before that jack gives way.

18:29.692 --> 18:30.942
On it.

18:31.068 --> 18:34.821
- My arm's stuck in the wheel well.
- OK. Stay as still as you can.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.865
We're going to get this
car stable and get you out.

18:36.991 --> 18:39.910
- What's your name?
- Bloom. Dave Bloom.

18:40.036 --> 18:42.871
- You a lieutenant?
- Yes, sir, I am.

18:42.997 --> 18:44.581
Well, I'm in good hands.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.463
Clarke, get a CO2
extinguisher ready

18:51.589 --> 18:53.173
just in case this thing
decides to go up.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.382
You got it, Chief.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.053
You OK?

18:58.179 --> 18:59.805
Yeah.

18:59.931 --> 19:03.558
- You're a brave man, Dave Bloom.
- Car is stabilized.

19:03.684 --> 19:07.229
I can take my pry ax to the tire,
but it'll jerk the car.

19:07.355 --> 19:08.939
I'll hold him steady.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.732
We can get a line in him
to ease the pain.

19:10.858 --> 19:14.194
No. I'm already on painkillers,
might not interact well.

19:14.320 --> 19:15.821
Hey, are you sure?
What're you on?

19:15.947 --> 19:18.281
Oxycodone.
It's prescription.

19:18.407 --> 19:22.035
I was injured on the job,
used to be Denver Fire Department.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.039
- Go ahead with the tire.
- Will do.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.375
Go.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.839
Give me the alligator.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.551
Hang on, buddy.

19:47.395 --> 19:49.980
Your arm's going to be OK.
You have blood flow.

19:50.106 --> 19:51.898
I owe you one, Lieutenants.

19:55.528 --> 19:56.820
Hey, Chief.

19:59.866 --> 20:05.245
I just got off the phone
with Chuck Ewing at OEMC.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.790
You filed a report
against one of their dispatchers?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.334
Yes, sir.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.880
Why would you not mention that to me?

20:16.549 --> 20:19.801
Uh, I wanted to keep
the situation private.

20:19.927 --> 20:22.762
Well, next time you go through me.

20:23.598 --> 20:24.890
Yes, sir.

20:25.016 --> 20:27.517
Because right now you're in
a he-said, she-said situation

20:27.643 --> 20:29.519
with this Victor Ramsey.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.104
What does that mean?

20:31.230 --> 20:35.358
Apparently he's one of their top men
and he's denying harassment.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.071
I'm told the tapes don't indicate
much more than a few personal "Hellos,"

20:40.197 --> 20:42.365
which he's been told to stop,
by the way.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.117
He was calling
me on my cell phone!

20:44.243 --> 20:45.994
He claims it was a social call

20:46.120 --> 20:48.663
and that he met up with you for a beer
last week at your request.

20:48.789 --> 20:49.706
Is that true?

20:55.087 --> 20:56.296
Yes.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.465
Did he threaten you?

21:03.846 --> 21:05.680
Well, he has gotten a warning.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.891
But that is the best
that we can do right now.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.521
Yes, sir. I get it.

21:19.570 --> 21:21.613
I don't get it.
So, he's good at his job,

21:21.739 --> 21:23.615
so he's allowed to get away
with being personal

21:23.741 --> 21:24.991
and crazy with female EMTs?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.493
It's just stalker behavior.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.787
Are they going to wait
for him to actually hurt somebody

21:28.913 --> 21:30.872
before they do anything about it?
It's ridiculous!

21:30.998 --> 21:33.208
- Exactly.
- Who's stalking?

21:34.710 --> 21:38.713
Uh, this wackadoo dispatcher, Ramsey.
He got all weird with Dawson

21:38.839 --> 21:41.841
and they're not going to do anything
about it over at OEMC.

21:44.762 --> 21:46.429
Do you want me
to talk to my dad?

21:46.555 --> 21:47.806
No, no, no, no, no, no.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.058
There's no reason to pull
any favors from your dad on this.

21:50.184 --> 21:52.477
I'm sure it'll just
work itself out.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.229
Right. But thank you.
That, that's nice.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.981
Yeah, thanks.

21:56.107 --> 21:58.733
OK. Well.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.570
Let me know
if you change your mind.

22:10.913 --> 22:14.874
Hey, um, how was that firefighter,
the good Samaritan guy?

22:15.001 --> 22:18.044
Uh, he had mobility in the arm
when we dropped him off, looked good.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.880
But that injury he was talking about,
that knocked him off the job?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.173
That was
four years ago.

22:22.925 --> 22:26.261
- So, the painkillers he's on...
- He's been on those a long time.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.222
Severide, Shay,

22:29.348 --> 22:33.059
you gather everyone up and tell them
to meet me in the common room.

22:37.273 --> 22:41.026
OK. Uh, look.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.778
I know it's end of shift
and y'all are anxious to get home.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.282
But I wanted you
all to hear this from me.

22:47.408 --> 22:49.701
Unfortunately Mrs. Brooker,

22:49.827 --> 22:52.495
the woman who lost her husband
at the 47th street fire...

22:54.582 --> 22:56.958
She is charging the CFD
with wrongful death.

22:58.919 --> 23:00.295
What's that mean?

23:00.421 --> 23:02.922
It means she's pinning
his death on us.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.013
OK.

23:45.424 --> 23:49.427
- What?
- Hey, uh, it's Bloom, right?

23:49.553 --> 23:51.262
Yeah.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.642
Oh, you're the Squad Lieutenant,
pulled me out from underneath that car.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.435
Yeah, Kelly Severide.

23:59.522 --> 24:00.939
This is temporary.

24:01.065 --> 24:03.566
Oh, vintage airstreams,
these things are nice.

24:03.692 --> 24:05.735
Yeah, well, this one could use
refurbishing.

24:05.861 --> 24:07.445
I'm only drawing
a partial severance,

24:07.571 --> 24:09.656
so I can't really afford
to put any money in it.

24:09.782 --> 24:11.616
Hey, thanks for saving my arm.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.285
My chances of getting back on the job
would've been zero

24:14.411 --> 24:16.287
if I'd been left with a stump, so...

24:19.500 --> 24:21.251
Seeing what you did
to help that lady,

24:21.377 --> 24:23.336
being able to get
you out, it, uh...

24:24.296 --> 24:25.713
It meant a lot to us.

24:25.840 --> 24:29.926
It's been, um,
it's been a rough week.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.680
A fellow firefighter is a brother
no matter what the city.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.057
If you ever want to come by 51,
we'd be glad to have you.

24:38.227 --> 24:41.229
You know, I got a pot on the stove
and I need to get back to it.

24:41.355 --> 24:44.816
- So, uh, you take care.
- Yeah. Sure.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.361
You too.

24:53.868 --> 24:57.203
So, Chief Boden said we have to go in
for the deposition tomorrow.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.831
That's pretty quick.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.457
It's a preliminary meeting.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.544
Does anybody mind if I use
one of these lawyers as a latrine?

25:04.670 --> 25:07.172
- 'Cause that's what they deserve...
- Herrmann. I'm eating.

25:07.298 --> 25:09.048
All right. Sorry.

25:10.009 --> 25:13.720
Hey, Mouch. So, let's talk about
potential prospects for you.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.433
Yeah, 'cause that
ain't going to happen.

25:18.559 --> 25:22.687
I realize that. Like I said,
she's currently involved.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.193
Kendra has a friend who met
this great guy on this website

25:28.319 --> 25:31.446
and they're engaged and I thought
you should check it out.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.911
Golden Oldeez dot com?

25:39.121 --> 25:41.164
This is for the
nursing home set.

25:41.290 --> 25:44.959
- Hmm? No, it's not.
- Kendra's friend's 60.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.669
You think I'm 60?

25:48.297 --> 25:51.424
No! Uh-uh. No way.
How old are you?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.551
Golden Oldeez.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.307
Hey, hey, how old is Mouch?

25:59.433 --> 26:00.808
My age.

26:03.646 --> 26:04.646
Hmm.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.815
Hey, the apartment's ours.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.401
That's fantastic.

26:10.527 --> 26:12.487
We just have to meet the
landlord tomorrow at 3:00,

26:12.613 --> 26:14.405
show him we're
not serial killers.

26:14.531 --> 26:17.659
Oh! Damn. I'm meeting the trainer
tomorrow at the Academy.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.619
- Just push it to next week.
- I can't.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.247
I got to get as much time as I can
get from this guy before the test.

26:22.373 --> 26:23.915
I'll help you work out
this weekend.

26:24.041 --> 26:26.251
It's not the same.
It's drills with other candidates.

26:26.377 --> 26:27.794
All right.

26:29.505 --> 26:32.548
This is when Lee Henry starts shouting,
"Are you getting divorced?

26:32.675 --> 26:34.133
"Can I live with Mom?"

26:37.596 --> 26:40.640
Ambulance 61, man down,
Chicago and Rush.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.107
Bloom.

26:49.233 --> 26:52.485
Oh, hey. Hey, is it a good time?
If not, I can come back later.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.364
No, it's a perfect time.
Come on, I'll show you around.

27:08.210 --> 27:12.505
Main to 61, correction on
the cross street. Pearson, not Chicago.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.342
Copy that, Main.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.178
No more Ramsey.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.685
That damn horse almost killed me!
You should put him down!

27:25.811 --> 27:29.105
Look at him! He's crazy!
My leg is broken!

27:29.231 --> 27:32.692
What took you so long? Time is money
on my job! I cannot just sit here.

27:32.818 --> 27:35.528
Ma'am, we got here
as quickly as possible, OK?

27:35.654 --> 27:37.530
Isn't that what
she does all day? Sit?

27:37.656 --> 27:39.782
Brady always stops when he sees
somebody in front of him.

27:39.908 --> 27:43.119
What? That thing just charged at me.
Maybe it has rabies or something!

27:43.245 --> 27:44.203
Oh, please.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.414
OK, sir, why don't you show me
where your leg hurts?

27:46.540 --> 27:48.499
It's right there! Where it's
all messed up! Look!

27:48.625 --> 27:51.127
How long is this going to take?
I need to pick up a fare.

27:51.253 --> 27:53.629
This contusion is
at least three weeks old.

27:53.756 --> 27:56.257
Push there!
Push right there, it's broken!

27:56.383 --> 27:57.550
OK. OK.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.677
Uh, we are here to help you.

27:59.803 --> 28:03.848
That is our job and we are just thrilled
to be doing it.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.059
So, we will do everything we can
to treat your injury.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.477
Yes.

28:07.603 --> 28:10.188
And while we do so, we hope
that you'll refrain from yelling at us.

28:10.314 --> 28:13.441
- Or suing us.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. That would be good.

28:13.567 --> 28:15.651
OK? You're all wrapped up there

28:15.778 --> 28:19.530
and, uh, it was a pleasure
doing business with you.

28:19.656 --> 28:20.698
Best of luck.

28:20.824 --> 28:23.659
Good day and take care.

28:30.167 --> 28:32.251
So, what brought you to Chicago?

28:32.378 --> 28:34.504
Recovering from a back injury,
believe it or not.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.048
- I had some rehab here.
- How's your back?

28:37.174 --> 28:40.718
- Well, it was getting better.
- You can get back to work soon, then?

28:40.844 --> 28:43.137
Hope so.

28:44.681 --> 28:45.765
Yeah. Bloom, grab some chow.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.059
Our candidate's food almost
passes as edible these days.

28:48.185 --> 28:49.477
No, I'm good.

28:49.603 --> 28:51.521
You got lady firefighters
in Denver, Bloom?

28:51.647 --> 28:53.940
Yeah. A few, sure.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.025
You miss being on the job?

28:57.486 --> 28:58.486
Yeah.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.030
Some things I bet you don't miss.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.741
We just got hit
with a wrongful death lawsuit

29:03.867 --> 29:06.869
for a guy who was dead
way before we got there.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.746
It was a sad situation actually.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.916
The father laid down
on his whole family

29:12.042 --> 29:13.835
and ended up saving their lives.

29:15.212 --> 29:18.381
That guy was, uh, in pretty bad shape
by the time we got him out.

29:24.471 --> 29:26.806
Thanks for the welcome, fellows,
but I just noticed the time.

29:26.932 --> 29:30.059
- I got a doctor's appointment.
- Uh, is it close?

29:30.185 --> 29:32.353
Why don't you stop by afterward?

29:32.479 --> 29:34.689
Uh, no, it's all the way
across town. Thanks, though.

29:38.485 --> 29:40.236
Guy hasn't been to a firehouse
in four years,

29:40.362 --> 29:42.280
why the hell you got to bring up
the lawsuit, Mouch?

29:43.657 --> 29:45.783
Didn't realize the topic
was off limits, Lieutenant.

29:46.952 --> 29:50.663
Next time I'll talk pros and cons
of portable extinguishers.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.255
Oh! My bad.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.633
Hey, I saw you talking to Jones,
earlier, is she OK?

30:02.759 --> 30:03.968
Oh, yeah, she'll be fine.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.805
Where you headed? Night jog?

30:07.931 --> 30:09.640
I left my bag in the car.
I'm gonna go grab it.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.908
Gabby, I'm,
I'm sorry if I scared you.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.203
What are you, what are you
doing here, Ramsey?

30:30.329 --> 30:32.914
I just wanted to talk
to you in private. I'm sorry.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.582
I knew you wouldn't
take my calls.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.084
I barely know you.
Why are you calling me?

30:37.211 --> 30:39.504
The thing is, when I started
working in your district

30:39.630 --> 30:41.672
I saw you a couple of times
in the street cam

30:41.798 --> 30:45.593
and you reminded
me of a good friend

30:45.719 --> 30:49.722
and she died a while back,
a car accident.

30:50.599 --> 30:52.558
So, I guess it was
nice to be reminded.

30:54.811 --> 30:55.853
I'm sorry.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.105
I wanted to help her
and I couldn't.

30:58.232 --> 30:59.690
So, I tried to help you.

31:04.488 --> 31:06.322
Uh, that's her.

31:08.075 --> 31:10.910
That's Lila.
She was a go-getter.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.704
Tough. Fearless. Like you.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.917
She thought about medical school for
a while, but she didn't have the money.

31:18.043 --> 31:19.502
I bet she would've
been a good medic.

31:20.879 --> 31:23.172
Maybe you two
would've been friends.

31:27.803 --> 31:30.012
Yeah, maybe we would've.

31:33.016 --> 31:35.726
I should've told you
right away. I wish I had.

31:37.479 --> 31:40.356
Rather than freak you out
and get myself fired.

31:42.109 --> 31:43.734
You were fired?

31:54.580 --> 31:57.331
- Little on the snug side.
- Nah, it's fine.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.086
Oh! She looks a lot better in a suit
than all you do.

32:07.509 --> 32:08.593
OK.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.221
Let's do this.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.127
And I ordered my men
directly to the second floor,

32:43.253 --> 32:45.087
where the witness
heard the children.

32:46.340 --> 32:47.965
Lieutenant Casey,

32:48.091 --> 32:50.676
I understand
you were the first inside.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.888
Can you tell us what happened
after you went in?

32:54.014 --> 32:59.101
Yes, um,
three members of my unit

32:59.227 --> 33:02.271
as well as two
from Lieutenant Severide's

33:02.397 --> 33:05.733
entered the main floor
and proceeded immediately

33:05.859 --> 33:07.902
up the stairs to
the second floor.

33:08.028 --> 33:10.988
The door was locked,
so we had to take it down.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.740
And how long
did that take?

33:13.950 --> 33:17.411
About 10 seconds, I'd say.
It was pretty quick.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.872
And once you got inside?

33:23.835 --> 33:26.170
We were at zero visibility.

33:27.339 --> 33:32.301
Yelling for anyone to call out,
but no one did. So, uh...

33:33.804 --> 33:37.181
We split up and I went directly
into the bedroom

33:37.307 --> 33:39.642
at the west end of the hall.

33:39.768 --> 33:41.644
And what happened
when you entered?

33:42.646 --> 33:46.399
I got low and moved into the room.

33:46.525 --> 33:50.277
And I was sweeping my arm out
when I felt something.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.034
Go ahead, Lieutenant.

33:58.870 --> 34:02.415
Uh, I'm not sure Mrs. Brooker wants
to hear this.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.251
I'm not going anywhere.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.964
Go ahead.

34:11.466 --> 34:13.926
I moved closer. And, um...

34:17.597 --> 34:18.806
I felt a man's arm.

34:20.058 --> 34:23.018
I could tell it was burned
pretty badly.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.982
I reached out further and...

34:31.611 --> 34:36.699
I felt several small bodies
just beneath him.

34:39.953 --> 34:42.496
I called into the radio for help.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.336
When we rolled the man
off of his family...

34:51.465 --> 34:53.257
We, uh, we felt the children moving

34:53.383 --> 34:57.678
and, uh, we were extremely relieved.

35:02.768 --> 35:03.934
Uh.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.777
Lieutenant Casey handed the children off

35:12.903 --> 35:15.446
to the firefighters one by one.

35:16.573 --> 35:17.948
Then the mother.

35:18.074 --> 35:22.161
Then he and I lifted
Mr. Brooker together.

35:27.834 --> 35:28.959
Mrs. Brooker...

35:33.131 --> 35:35.841
I am lucky enough to work
with some of the best,

35:35.967 --> 35:38.385
bravest firefighters in the world.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.264
But what your husband did
to save his family...

35:45.977 --> 35:48.062
That was the bravest thing
I've ever seen.

36:18.218 --> 36:20.469
- Evening, Lieutenant.
- Hey.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.472
Damn cold out tonight.
Can I come in?

36:23.598 --> 36:24.974
No.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.688
Look, I appreciate the invite
down to the station house, I do,

36:30.814 --> 36:33.107
but I'm not the social type.

36:33.233 --> 36:34.817
So, you take care of yourself.

36:34.943 --> 36:37.027
Look, Bloom, I know
what you're going through.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.323
- I've been there myself.
- You don't know anything about me.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.825
Nothing.

36:43.827 --> 36:45.202
I know something
about you, though.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.496
I knew it the first time
that you pulled up here.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.582
See, you are looking
for an easy save.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.084
Oh yeah, something to make you
feel better about yourself.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.712
You need to be the knight
in shining armor.

36:55.964 --> 36:58.716
Well, do I look like
a damsel in distress? Hmm?

37:02.971 --> 37:05.681
Then go look for your redemption
someplace else.

37:20.030 --> 37:21.780
So, she's dropping the suit?

37:21.907 --> 37:23.782
Yeah, forget gratitude
and appreciation.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.535
Maybe not getting sued is good as it
gets these days.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.580
I just don't understand
any of it.

37:32.292 --> 37:35.753
People need to find meaning
when someone they love dies.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.172
I get it.

37:39.424 --> 37:40.716
Hey!

37:40.842 --> 37:44.762
Me and Cruz, me and Cruz just signed
a lease on that great apartment.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.389
We went to that meeting,
since you guys couldn't make it.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.516
So, it's still in the family!

37:49.643 --> 37:53.228
Oh, and you guys can
come over any time.

37:53.355 --> 37:55.147
Any time.

37:55.273 --> 37:57.900
- Thanks, guys.
- Mmm, yeah.

38:01.571 --> 38:06.158
Lieutenant, you did us proud
in that hearing.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.785
Thanks, Mouch.

38:07.911 --> 38:14.875
And I wanted to thank you for the good
advice the other day, about Mari.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.880
You were right.
I need to rally.

38:24.844 --> 38:27.930
"Good advice."
Good advice, come on.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.640
You heard him.

38:29.766 --> 38:32.309
- Hey, look who's here!
- Chief!

38:34.104 --> 38:36.146
Wow! To what do we owe
this honor?

38:36.272 --> 38:39.692
I was feeling some familial pride
and decided to raise a glass to 51.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.652
Then it's time for another round.

38:53.164 --> 39:00.045
Hey, um, Jones borrowed
some equipment off-shift

39:00.171 --> 39:02.339
to practice her
swings or something.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.216
Anyway, she forgot
to sign it out.

39:05.427 --> 39:08.429
Give me the word, I'll sign
the papers and have her DQ'd

39:08.555 --> 39:11.306
and leave it on
your desk in the morning.

39:14.477 --> 39:18.147
Deputy District Chief Jones
does not like to be disrespected.

39:22.318 --> 39:24.737
He's going to make
our lives a living hell.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.789
Hey.

39:37.333 --> 39:39.960
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for reaching out to your dad.

39:40.086 --> 39:44.214
Hey, no problem. Honestly,
kicking into action felt good.

39:44.340 --> 39:46.425
And, besides,
I told you at Academy,

39:46.551 --> 39:48.552
us ladies, we got to have
each other's backs.

39:48.678 --> 39:50.179
I meant that.

39:54.017 --> 39:58.270
Well, there's another favor
I have to ask.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.190
This is going to
sound crazy, but, um,

40:01.316 --> 40:03.567
I really need to get
that guy his job back.

40:03.693 --> 40:05.861
It's a, it's a long story.

40:05.987 --> 40:10.991
No problem. You know, my dad
has been surprisingly helpful lately.

40:12.452 --> 40:14.036
Nicest he's been
to me in years.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.582
He's trying to get you DQ'd.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.046
What?

40:29.469 --> 40:30.719
He wants you off the job

40:30.845 --> 40:32.262
and he's doing everything he can

40:32.388 --> 40:34.807
to make sure you get stuck
behind a desk.

40:38.937 --> 40:40.312
Yo!

40:53.576 --> 40:54.910
Jones!

40:56.287 --> 40:58.038
Jones, slow down, come on!

40:59.249 --> 41:02.751
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, slow down.
What's up?

41:06.589 --> 41:09.591
- God! Hold on, OK?
- Come on, come back to my place.

41:09.717 --> 41:11.385
Jones, Jones, I can't do that.

41:11.511 --> 41:13.720
Just slow down and talk to me, OK?
What's up?

41:15.890 --> 41:17.474
Screw you.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.770
Taxi!
