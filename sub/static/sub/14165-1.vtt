THE FÜHRER'S TABLE

04:19.250 --> 04:22.616
MUNICH, NOVEMBER 8, 1939

04:23.250 --> 04:27.291
We welcome our Führer
with three cheers.

04:27.459 --> 04:29.169
- Sieg...
- Heil!

04:29.367 --> 04:30.677
- Sieg...
- Heil!

04:30.885 --> 04:32.337
- Sieg...
- Heil!

04:35.042 --> 04:37.613
I give the floor to the Führer.

04:50.625 --> 04:53.540
Fellow party comrades!

04:54.125 --> 04:55.666
Fellow Germans!

04:55.834 --> 04:59.185
I have come to you...

04:59.536 --> 05:03.418
for only a few hours,

05:03.454 --> 05:05.162
to evoke in your midst

05:05.334 --> 05:10.785
the memory of a day...

05:11.209 --> 05:13.329
FOG!
AIRPLANE UNABLE TO START!

05:13.500 --> 05:16.913
...which was of great
importance for us,

05:17.084 --> 05:20.496
for our movement,
and for the German people.

05:21.167 --> 05:26.618
If, during the four years
from 1919 to 1923,

05:26.792 --> 05:30.916
the National Socialist Movement
was able to grow to such an extent

05:31.084 --> 05:33.619
that it succeeded,
for the first time,

05:33.792 --> 05:38.533
in mobilising the entire nation
in a stirring event,

05:38.709 --> 05:42.833
then this was due to the general
state Germany found itself in.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.541
KONSTANZ, LAKE CONSTANCE

05:44.709 --> 05:48.406
A terrible catastrophe had befallen
our country and our people.

05:48.584 --> 05:51.072
What forced Germany
to succumb at the time

05:51.250 --> 05:52.624
were the lies of
our adversaries.

05:52.792 --> 05:54.368
GERMAN-SWISS BORDER

05:54.542 --> 05:56.912
The lies told by the same men
who are lying again today.

05:57.084 --> 06:01.492
However, everyone must understand
that they are not sacrificing any more

06:01.667 --> 06:04.784
than all the others
sacrificed before them.

06:04.959 --> 06:08.538
We are also aware

06:08.709 --> 06:12.785
of how much destiny
has assisted us

06:12.959 --> 06:14.949
and enabled us
to do so much.

06:15.125 --> 06:19.119
It let us forge our plans
in the right way

06:19.292 --> 06:21.959
and blessed their
successful outcome.

06:32.625 --> 06:33.620
Hello!

06:36.042 --> 06:37.451
Where are you going?

06:38.334 --> 06:40.289
I'm looking for an old friend.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.656
Feuchtelhuber of the
Konstanz Folklore Society.

06:48.375 --> 06:50.413
I used to be a member there.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.416
None of us know
whether they will suffer.

06:55.584 --> 06:59.577
What our women sacrifice
to bear the nation's children,

06:59.750 --> 07:03.495
our men sacrifice by
defending the country.

07:04.584 --> 07:07.333
We National Socialists
have always been fighters.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.913
Now the great moment has come
to prove ourselves as fighters.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.787
No one but us can
be victorious.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.533
That Mr Churchill
doesn't think so,

07:28.709 --> 07:30.829
I shall put down
to his old age.

07:36.042 --> 07:37.784
Others didn't
believe it either.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.495
They will be told by Churchill,
by Chamberlain...

07:41.667 --> 07:43.457
Why are you wearing
that badge?

07:44.500 --> 07:45.779
Out of support.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.788
The Red Front is an
illegal organisation.

07:51.417 --> 07:54.829
...if we hadn't been
drawn into it by England.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.622
England boosted its power
through agitation and incitement.

08:58.542 --> 09:00.284
REICH SECURITY MAIN OFFICE

09:00.459 --> 09:03.954
Heinrich, I'd like to join
my wife at the opera.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.792
The Reichsführer wants
our new figures

09:06.959 --> 09:09.412
submitted to him for the
big meeting tomorrow.

09:09.584 --> 09:12.700
What's complicated about
listing all detained lunatics?

09:12.875 --> 09:15.032
The clerical task
isn't complicated.

09:15.209 --> 09:18.372
But we need to decide whether
to include church institutions.

09:18.542 --> 09:21.990
No exceptions.
This reflects the Reichsführer's wishes.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.708
The priests will make a fuss.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.498
They'll calm down again.

09:26.334 --> 09:29.829
I'd propose to Himmler that
we proceed step by step.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.374
First...

09:31.542 --> 09:32.656
Not now, Bauer!

09:32.834 --> 09:35.404
An attempt on the
Führer's life in Munich.

09:35.584 --> 09:36.578
A bomb.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.788
Half the roof is said
to have caved in.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.409
First MG squad,
take position!

09:42.584 --> 09:45.368
Second MG squad,
take position!

10:36.792 --> 10:38.119
Alight!

10:39.709 --> 10:41.036
Move!

10:44.709 --> 10:47.327
- Move!
- Line formation!

10:48.500 --> 10:49.958
Line up!

10:51.292 --> 10:53.496
- Here's the list.
- Thank you.

10:58.792 --> 11:00.498
Heil Hitler!

11:00.667 --> 11:01.946
My name is Eberle,

11:02.125 --> 11:04.412
I'm the Local Party Leader here.
At your service.

11:04.584 --> 11:05.578
Heil Hitler.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.990
All relatives of
one Georg Elser,

11:08.167 --> 11:11.947
last known address Turkenstraße 59
in Munich, to report to the square.

11:12.125 --> 11:13.583
What has Georgie done?

11:13.750 --> 11:15.409
You instruct my men.

11:15.584 --> 11:16.993
But the Elsers are harmless.

11:17.167 --> 11:19.288
That's an order!

11:20.792 --> 11:21.822
Yes, sir!

11:31.125 --> 11:32.666
Is this the lot of them?

11:32.834 --> 11:34.540
Yes, Major,

11:34.709 --> 11:36.829
including his former fiancée,
Elsa Stephan.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.409
The whole lot to Berlin
for questioning!

11:42.750 --> 11:43.780
Come!

11:43.959 --> 11:45.155
How dare you?

11:45.334 --> 11:48.450
- Let go! - Don't, Elsa,
or they'll take them, too.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.616
I'll bring them to your mother.

12:33.959 --> 12:38.533
These are the corrected lunatic asylum
statistics that we're re-submitting.

12:38.709 --> 12:41.872
- Including the church ones?
- Yes. The gentlemen are waiting.

13:33.209 --> 13:36.539
Gentlemen, we cannot afford
to make a mistake now,

13:36.709 --> 13:38.995
not even the slightest.

14:02.417 --> 14:03.993
Halt!

14:26.750 --> 14:27.947
Heil Hitler, Mr Elser.

14:30.125 --> 14:31.322
Heil Hitler.

14:33.042 --> 14:34.499
Good day.

14:36.125 --> 14:39.704
Or good day,
if you prefer that.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.285
My name is Nebe.

14:42.459 --> 14:46.239
Head of Criminal Police.
I'm in charge of your case.

14:46.417 --> 14:50.541
This is the head of the Gestapo,
Oberführer Müller.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.915
Elser...

14:53.084 --> 14:56.947
How do you think your wicked
assassination attempt ended?

14:58.834 --> 15:02.827
We mourn the death of seven innocent
people for which you are responsible.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.410
Seven men and women,

15:04.584 --> 15:07.582
including a waitress,
married with two children.

15:07.750 --> 15:11.578
A marching band flautist, leaving behind
a wife and teenage daughter.

15:11.750 --> 15:14.239
What did these
people do to you?

15:14.417 --> 15:17.368
Who gave you the
right to kill them?

15:18.875 --> 15:21.708
Don't you have anything
to say to the relatives?

15:22.792 --> 15:24.699
Not a single word?

15:30.667 --> 15:32.953
Do you think the
Führer is dead?

15:35.334 --> 15:37.371
You think you succeeded?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.080
The Führer is alive.

15:44.250 --> 15:47.663
He left the Bürgerbräukeller
13 minutes before the explosion.

15:47.834 --> 15:50.500
Your assassination attempt failed.

15:56.584 --> 15:59.866
You were carrying bomb schematics
when you were arrested.

16:00.625 --> 16:03.410
You spent a lot of time
at the Bürgerbräukeller.

16:04.459 --> 16:06.082
Take off your trousers.

16:07.625 --> 16:08.999
I want to see your knees.

16:12.209 --> 16:13.749
Off with your trousers!

16:24.500 --> 16:26.325
I want to see your knees.

16:33.959 --> 16:35.333
Elser...

16:36.292 --> 16:40.499
I'm now giving you your only chance
to own up to everything.

16:41.375 --> 16:45.037
You think you know everything already.
Shoot me and get it over with.

16:45.209 --> 16:47.365
We're not there
yet by a long way.

16:50.834 --> 16:52.741
Let's start right
at the beginning.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.334
Name?
Date of birth?

17:25.041 --> 17:26.867
KONSTANZ, LAKE CONSTANCE 1932

17:27.041 --> 17:29.791
<i>Where we gather</i>

17:30.875 --> 17:33.446
<i>Under the linden trees</i>

17:34.584 --> 17:38.280
<i>At eventide</i>

17:39.292 --> 17:42.243
<i>Where we gather</i>

17:43.500 --> 17:46.333
<i>Under the linden trees</i>

17:47.875 --> 17:51.039
<i>At eventide</i>

17:52.917 --> 17:58.866
<i>Many hours we've
spent here together</i>

17:59.042 --> 18:02.123
<i>Sitting in a...</i>

18:24.667 --> 18:27.286
You know you'll have to
make up for your attack.

18:30.500 --> 18:31.827
Do you love me?

18:33.459 --> 18:35.117
You never commit, do you?

18:36.125 --> 18:37.950
You know I like spending
time with you.

21:12.334 --> 21:13.708
And what about Bruni?

21:13.875 --> 21:16.708
Nothing.
She's having fun too.

21:19.584 --> 21:20.911
I'll leave if you want.

21:23.792 --> 21:24.989
Are you crazy?

21:46.084 --> 21:47.909
I hope no one died.

21:52.875 --> 21:54.913
That stupid old drunkard.

21:55.084 --> 21:56.576
Your father?
Is he dead?

21:56.750 --> 21:59.701
He sold another two fields,
our best land.

21:59.875 --> 22:02.364
Now I'm supposed to
sort things out at home.

22:32.417 --> 22:34.573
The Messerschmitt is worth two.

22:38.375 --> 22:39.785
Georgie Elser is back.

22:41.459 --> 22:44.029
- Hi, Lore. How's the leg?
- Same as always.

22:44.209 --> 22:45.749
Will you stay with
your folks now?

22:45.917 --> 22:47.458
Looks like it.

22:47.625 --> 22:49.083
They need you urgently.

22:49.917 --> 22:53.413
You have to register within 48 hours,
that's now the law.

22:53.584 --> 22:55.539
I won't stay longer
than four weeks.

22:55.709 --> 22:58.623
- Still. - All you can think
of is supervising.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.074
Hi, Elmar.

23:03.250 --> 23:06.497
My dad says Lore shouldn't
act like a big shot,

23:06.667 --> 23:08.823
she's with a Jew
from Heidenheim.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.749
Who turned you into a
moron all of a sudden?

23:12.875 --> 23:15.542
There, you better give
me a hand with this.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.327
Good day.

23:28.334 --> 23:31.367
Are there soldiers at the
Konstanz border crossing?

23:32.709 --> 23:34.580
Customs officers,
that's enough.

23:34.750 --> 23:36.871
What's in the box?
Show me.

23:37.042 --> 23:38.949
There's no show today.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.160
Mother?

23:53.250 --> 23:55.040
Georg.

23:55.209 --> 23:56.831
At last.

23:59.125 --> 24:00.499
Come here, my boy.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.905
- Thank you for coming.
- Where is he?

24:52.375 --> 24:54.496
Come on, no stopping.

24:54.667 --> 24:56.076
Leave the cider alone.

25:23.959 --> 25:25.332
Damn it!

25:25.500 --> 25:27.076
Keep the blade straight!

25:33.875 --> 25:36.992
If I'm supposed to help you,
stop the boozing.

25:37.167 --> 25:39.999
You little shit!
That cider was expensive!

25:40.167 --> 25:41.660
I never booze
and I'm still alive.

25:52.625 --> 25:54.829
I don't like repeating myself.

25:57.000 --> 25:59.453
Name?
Date of birth?

26:40.167 --> 26:42.702
Name?
Date of birth?

26:54.500 --> 26:57.249
Name?
Date of birth?

27:07.542 --> 27:09.118
Name?

27:09.292 --> 27:10.453
Date of birth?

27:27.167 --> 27:29.537
Name?
Date of birth?

27:37.000 --> 27:39.832
Name?
Date of birth?

27:47.667 --> 27:50.072
Name?
Date of birth?

27:57.334 --> 27:59.620
Name?
Date of birth?

28:04.792 --> 28:07.162
Name?
Date of birth?

28:12.667 --> 28:14.953
Name?
Date of birth?

28:38.875 --> 28:39.905
Again:

28:40.084 --> 28:42.916
Name?
Date of birth?

28:44.000 --> 28:45.955
Kiss my ass.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.950
I can't hear you.

28:49.792 --> 28:52.115
Kiss my ass!

29:46.292 --> 29:50.665
Send this to Baumann. I want him
to order this weed killer from IG Farben.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.159
Very well, Oberführer.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.489
I know this breed from
the Swabian Hills.

29:57.667 --> 30:00.037
They'd rather be beaten
to death than give in.

30:00.209 --> 30:02.413
Shall I tell this to
the Reichsführer SS?

30:02.584 --> 30:04.953
There's this breed
from the Swabian Hills...

30:05.125 --> 30:07.032
That guy is merely a puppet.

30:07.209 --> 30:09.282
Just look at his physiognomy,

30:09.459 --> 30:10.537
his eyes.

30:10.709 --> 30:14.405
He's not some naive idiot.
The man knows what he wants.

30:14.584 --> 30:18.791
He may be a country boy, but he's
not lacking ideological conviction.

30:18.958 --> 30:20.866
And the evidence
is overwhelming.

30:21.042 --> 30:24.952
The Führer doesn't want evidence,
he wants a written confession.

30:25.125 --> 30:27.080
Goebbels needs it for the press.

30:27.250 --> 30:30.781
I'll pull out every one of his teeth
to make him sign if I have to.

30:30.958 --> 30:32.665
You saw that he
won't budge.

30:32.833 --> 30:35.785
Are you telling me
how to do my job now?

30:35.958 --> 30:38.577
Your lot should have
known about this sooner.

30:43.708 --> 30:46.541
Now where is that list of
the arrested relatives?

31:11.125 --> 31:15.166
I'm asking myself how an ethnic
German can hate our Führer so much

31:15.333 --> 31:18.285
to carry out such a
despicable attack.

31:20.833 --> 31:23.500
And on November 8th,
of all days.

31:32.875 --> 31:34.913
Now look who's joining us, Elser.

31:36.083 --> 31:37.576
Come in!

32:21.250 --> 32:22.791
Evening all.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.790
- Ernst, a beer and a kirsch!
- Beer and a kirsch, coming up.

32:26.958 --> 32:30.787
No. Erich has had enough.
Two orange sodas, please.

32:30.958 --> 32:34.075
What's it going to be, Erich?
Soda or the usual?

32:34.250 --> 32:36.241
The usual, you dumbass!

33:21.708 --> 33:22.703
Thank you.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.533
Shall we get some fresh air?

33:30.833 --> 33:32.575
That's Elsa.

33:33.625 --> 33:35.450
She's married.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.497
Those are the best ones.

33:42.583 --> 33:44.574
This seat is taken, Eberle.

33:47.208 --> 33:49.697
We found another dead
hare in a sling today.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.617
In the woods,
near the Itzelsberg.

33:51.792 --> 33:54.541
- That's above my field.
- Piss off, Eberle.

33:54.708 --> 33:58.537
I'll give you a good kicking
if the poaching doesn't stop.

34:03.792 --> 34:07.489
The dance is called a tango.
It's from South America.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.451
It's very close, almost sinful.

34:13.458 --> 34:14.951
Watch.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.036
One...

34:41.875 --> 34:45.322
One, two, tango step.

34:45.917 --> 34:47.493
One, two...

35:39.083 --> 35:40.363
Something like that.

35:41.125 --> 35:42.404
I'm Georgie Elser.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.158
You're Elsa, aren't you?

35:49.333 --> 35:50.743
I'm going back to my Erich.

36:05.875 --> 36:07.996
Hans, a round,
time to celebrate!

36:08.167 --> 36:10.039
So, what was
the percentage?

36:10.208 --> 36:14.332
The NSDAP is the biggest party
in the Reichstag with 44%.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.823
Come, Lore.
Let's go.

36:19.125 --> 36:21.874
The Reds lost.
What do you say now?

36:22.750 --> 36:24.456
There you go.

36:25.583 --> 36:28.700
- Come on, let's go.
- No, I'll finish my drink.

36:28.875 --> 36:29.870
There you go.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.491
To our Führer.
Sieg Heil!

36:32.667 --> 36:34.124
Sieg Heil!
Sieg Heil!

36:34.292 --> 36:36.531
- Quiet, we're playing cards!
- Hang on.

36:37.292 --> 36:38.915
We'll have no shouting here.

36:39.083 --> 36:41.240
- Who's shouting here?
- Calm down.

36:42.583 --> 36:43.662
Stay calm.

36:43.833 --> 36:45.789
Calm down.
Let's stay calm.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.950
Schurr, you'll be the first to be
strung up once we seize power.

36:51.125 --> 36:53.412
And you'll be shot
after the revolution.

37:07.250 --> 37:08.743
Idiots.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.663
You've been to Konstanz
and Switzerland?

37:12.833 --> 37:15.203
- Yes.
- Did you go to the cinema there?

37:24.917 --> 37:27.536
I saw a picture of Jacqueline Wells
in a magazine.

37:28.208 --> 37:32.072
She's so beautiful in
"Tarzan the Fearless".

37:39.167 --> 37:42.283
They say she's wearing
hardly anything in that film.

37:42.458 --> 37:44.449
That would interest you,
of course.

38:12.208 --> 38:14.827
Just die, you bastards!
Sons of bitches!

38:15.667 --> 38:16.662
Why did you leave?

38:16.833 --> 38:19.618
You've been fighting with
the Nazis for years. For what?

38:19.792 --> 38:21.948
Musician!
Go home and pray.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.287
Dirty pacifist!

38:23.458 --> 38:25.283
- So what?
- Shut up!

38:26.042 --> 38:27.369
You're a coward?

38:27.542 --> 38:29.781
Yes, maybe I am a coward,

38:29.958 --> 38:33.122
because violence has
never achieved anything.

38:50.958 --> 38:55.034
Elser, now tell your girl
here why you did this.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.491
Did you do this, Georg?

39:07.375 --> 39:08.868
Elsa.

39:15.875 --> 39:16.870
Take her away.

39:20.417 --> 39:21.696
Where are they taking her?

39:22.958 --> 39:24.700
That's entirely up to you.

39:56.208 --> 39:58.448
Our Father who art in heaven,

39:58.625 --> 40:00.699
hallowed be thy name.

40:00.875 --> 40:04.916
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.619
Give us this day
our daily bread,

40:07.792 --> 40:11.655
and forgive us our trespasses, as we
forgive those who trespass against us,

40:11.833 --> 40:14.073
and lead us not
into temptation,

40:14.250 --> 40:16.454
but deliver us from evil.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.367
For thine is the kingdom,

40:18.542 --> 40:21.789
and the power, and the glory,
for ever and ever.

40:21.958 --> 40:23.368
Amen.

40:41.833 --> 40:44.038
- Elsa...
- Yes?

40:44.208 --> 40:45.831
She has nothing
to do with this.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.156
Will you guarantee
she won't be harmed?

40:48.333 --> 40:51.331
She's not important to us if we
have a confession from you.

40:51.500 --> 40:53.621
If not,
it's a different matter.

40:54.667 --> 40:56.574
My word as an officer.

40:56.750 --> 40:58.657
That means nothing to me.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.824
I can't offer more.

41:04.542 --> 41:07.409
All right then.
It was me.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.655
My name is Elser,
Johann Georg.

41:11.833 --> 41:14.287
Born 4th January, 1903.

41:15.833 --> 41:17.243
Let's begin.

41:23.375 --> 41:24.916
Party membership?

41:25.083 --> 41:26.078
None.

41:29.000 --> 41:30.197
And this?

41:31.167 --> 41:33.371
My Red Front badge.

41:33.542 --> 41:36.824
But I was never a
Communist Party member.

41:54.583 --> 41:56.159
- Red Front.
- Red Front.

42:01.833 --> 42:03.492
Good that you're with us.

42:05.917 --> 42:08.749
WORKERS VOTE KPD

42:11.667 --> 42:13.243
- Josef!
- What?

42:13.417 --> 42:14.412
The H.

42:15.125 --> 42:16.701
- What?
- The H.

42:18.375 --> 42:19.749
- Shit!
- Add it!

42:19.917 --> 42:22.405
- Or the Browns will say we're idiots.
- Come on!

42:23.708 --> 42:25.367
Watch out!

42:25.542 --> 42:26.620
Shit!

42:28.000 --> 42:30.536
Stop! Halt!
Site security!

43:06.625 --> 43:09.658
"... I joined the Konstanz
Folklore Society. "

43:12.875 --> 43:14.581
Just for the companionship?

43:19.375 --> 43:21.662
I didn't join to pick up girls.

43:22.375 --> 43:24.531
You can meet girls anywhere.

43:25.250 --> 43:29.457
And before you ask, I wasn't close
to any girl from the society.

43:30.458 --> 43:32.496
Of course there
was the occasional...

43:32.667 --> 43:36.246
Why don't you just
admit you're a communist?

43:36.417 --> 43:39.747
No, I thought it was
enough to vote KPD.

43:39.917 --> 43:43.993
I'm sure you were involved in
demonstrations, handing out flyers...

43:44.167 --> 43:46.620
No.
I didn't even attend meetings.

43:46.792 --> 43:49.197
It's highly unlikely
an apolitical person

43:49.375 --> 43:52.657
would plan and carry out an
attack on such a huge scale.

43:53.375 --> 43:55.698
I was a free human being.

43:57.333 --> 43:58.447
Meaning?

43:59.417 --> 44:01.407
You have to do
what's right.

44:05.500 --> 44:09.031
If humanity isn't free,
everything dies with it.

44:14.125 --> 44:16.281
Am I allowed to write
one last letter?

44:16.458 --> 44:19.243
Please, just a few lines to
my fiancée and my mother.

44:20.583 --> 44:21.697
Take him away.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.989
MUNICH ASSASSIN CAPTURED

44:33.083 --> 44:35.074
ASSASSIN CAPTURED

44:48.292 --> 44:52.949
That small-time carpenter is trying to
hoodwink us, claiming he acted alone.

44:53.125 --> 44:56.407
Just one man can't construct
such a powerful bomb.

44:56.583 --> 44:59.581
Elser insists he carried out
the attack on his own.

45:00.375 --> 45:03.159
- There's no evidence...
- We won't let criminals call us liars!

45:04.792 --> 45:08.240
The Führer wants us to get him
to talk by any means necessary.

45:08.417 --> 45:11.354
- He must say who's behind it.
- Obergruppenführer,

45:11.616 --> 45:16.366
it's becoming clear no one
else is pulling the strings here.

45:18.042 --> 45:23.078
You might trigger the Führer's reaction
for being soft and failing when it counts.

45:45.625 --> 45:47.166
We don't believe a word of it.

45:47.333 --> 45:48.577
What?

45:48.750 --> 45:52.957
"For 30 nights, I waited until I got
locked in to the Bürgerbräukeller.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.158
"I wrapped a rag around
the rear part of the drill.

45:56.333 --> 46:01.453
"I benefitted from the lavatories
automatically flushing every 10 minutes.

46:01.625 --> 46:03.995
"I used the sound
to conceal my work,

46:04.167 --> 46:07.698
then waited another 10 minutes
for the flushing to start again. "

46:07.875 --> 46:08.870
Correct.

46:09.042 --> 46:11.993
A lowly craftsman like you
couldn't build a bomb like that.

46:12.167 --> 46:14.039
Who supplied your material?

46:14.208 --> 46:16.744
For the last time,
who were you working for?

46:20.333 --> 46:22.075
All right, I'll tell you.

46:23.792 --> 46:27.122
We only have two telephones
in the village.

46:27.292 --> 46:29.033
Churchill called
me at the dairy.

46:29.208 --> 46:31.531
The mayor's office would
have been a bad idea.

46:31.708 --> 46:33.367
Churchill called and said,

46:33.542 --> 46:37.701
"Elser, build a bomb to blow up Hitler
for me, we can't do it on our own. "

46:45.333 --> 46:47.407
I can't tell you
what didn't happen.

46:52.250 --> 46:55.781
Just give me pen and paper
and I'll prove it to you!

47:17.708 --> 47:19.580
18, 20...

47:20.208 --> 47:21.203
I'm out.

47:21.375 --> 47:22.749
- Three...
- I'm out.

47:22.917 --> 47:25.073
I'll go for diamonds
if you don't mind.

47:26.083 --> 47:28.916
- Heil Hitler, everyone.
- Heil Hitler.

47:29.083 --> 47:30.493
Hi.

47:30.667 --> 47:33.997
Ah, I see,
voluntary disbanding.

47:34.167 --> 47:35.162
Very sensible.

47:35.333 --> 47:39.541
But if you think that the strike
fund will disappear with you,

47:39.708 --> 47:41.616
you've got another
thing coming.

47:42.458 --> 47:44.912
Listen up,
national comrades.

47:45.083 --> 47:48.828
How about attending the Gauleiter's
rally in Heidenheim later

47:49.000 --> 47:51.074
instead of playing
cards at the pub?

47:51.708 --> 47:53.201
Heil Hitler and good day.

47:53.375 --> 47:54.951
- Heil Hitler.
- Good day.

47:55.125 --> 47:56.748
Ernst, the usual combo.

47:56.917 --> 47:58.244
Coming up.

47:58.417 --> 48:02.245
Tell your Gauleiter there was
another hare caught in a sling.

48:04.417 --> 48:06.740
You can do whatever you like.

48:06.917 --> 48:09.287
But don't complain if it hurts.

48:16.292 --> 48:17.784
That was Elsa.

48:21.292 --> 48:24.455
But let me tell you, Eberle,
she won't talk back anytime soon.

48:42.333 --> 48:43.874
Elsa?

48:49.542 --> 48:52.077
- Elsa?
- Leave me alone.

48:52.250 --> 48:54.952
- Why? - I don't want
you to see me like this.

49:36.208 --> 49:37.405
What about Erich?

49:37.583 --> 49:40.830
He'll get drunk at the pub.
The children are asleep.

49:51.417 --> 49:52.874
You.

50:19.667 --> 50:21.704
It's different with you.

50:23.417 --> 50:24.696
Do you know that?

50:28.625 --> 50:31.825
When will you be going
back to Konstanz?

51:13.250 --> 51:16.911
If the instrument maker pays for
the maple wood, we could make it.

51:17.083 --> 51:19.489
Yes, Georg, God willing.

51:19.667 --> 51:23.163
If not, the marshals will
come take our house away.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.613
Where do we go then?

51:24.792 --> 51:26.866
I don't know.

51:27.042 --> 51:28.369
I might move in with Elsa.

51:28.542 --> 51:31.658
You shouldn't fool around
with married women.

51:31.833 --> 51:33.456
There's no fooling around.

51:33.625 --> 51:36.114
Erich is asking for a lodger
because he's hard up.

51:36.292 --> 51:39.989
You're not fooling me.
No one around here has any money.

51:40.167 --> 51:42.702
You want to be near
that woman.

51:42.875 --> 51:44.665
She has a bastard
child and you too.

51:44.833 --> 51:47.666
Don't get carried away, mother.
I'm a bastard myself.

51:47.833 --> 51:49.954
But your father married me.

51:50.125 --> 51:53.289
Elsa made her daughter
legitimate too. So what?

51:53.458 --> 51:55.781
You left Mathilde
with your child.

51:55.958 --> 51:57.499
Is that the done thing?

51:57.667 --> 51:59.539
I don't care what
the done thing is.

51:59.708 --> 52:02.244
If two people aren't right together,
it's misery.

52:02.417 --> 52:04.324
Just look at you
and father.

52:04.500 --> 52:06.123
You'll see what
this leads to,

52:06.292 --> 52:11.826
always doing exactly the
opposite of God's plan.

52:43.125 --> 52:44.499
Where else could they be?

52:44.667 --> 52:46.704
We'll find them,
don't you worry.

52:48.208 --> 52:51.621
- Halt! Gruppenführer, you'll go there!
- Yes, sir!

53:18.208 --> 53:20.614
Georg, I need your help.
Eberle is after me.

53:20.792 --> 53:21.786
Why?

53:21.958 --> 53:25.371
After their last rally,
the Nazis arrested all party members.

53:25.542 --> 53:27.283
Come in.

53:29.708 --> 53:32.706
- I knew I'd find you here.
- Put your hands up.

53:37.125 --> 53:38.582
What have we here?

53:38.750 --> 53:41.321
We only have orders to
go after party members,

53:41.500 --> 53:44.581
but soon it'll be the rest
of your Bolshevik scum.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.871
Take him away.

53:49.250 --> 53:50.873
What do you think
you're doing?

53:52.292 --> 53:53.571
Is he one of them too?

53:57.583 --> 53:59.621
He's just a
big-mouthed musician.

54:01.375 --> 54:04.159
Go inside.
This is none of your business.

54:05.083 --> 54:07.489
All right, then.
Let's go.

54:30.958 --> 54:33.447
WITH THE STURMER
AGAINST JUDAH

54:39.958 --> 54:43.822
HARVEST FESTIVAL 1934

54:48.167 --> 54:49.873
<i>Flim-fum, church scum</i>

54:50.042 --> 54:51.783
<i>Flim-fum, church scum</i>

54:51.958 --> 54:53.830
<i>The Führer blows
the churches up</i>

54:54.000 --> 54:55.955
<i>And all the priests
will be strung up</i>

54:56.125 --> 54:57.582
<i>Like your saviour
on the cross</i>

54:57.750 --> 54:59.788
<i>Flim-fum, church scum</i>

54:59.958 --> 55:02.245
Beat it,
you dirty scoundrels!

55:02.417 --> 55:03.614
Leave it, Leonhard!

55:10.333 --> 55:13.415
Now they're even blasting
things on the Lord's day.

55:42.583 --> 55:44.953
OK?
Well, go on...

55:45.125 --> 55:46.239
Hello, hello.

55:47.833 --> 55:49.540
Stand closer together.

55:58.125 --> 56:00.116
NSDAP CINEMA SHOWING
THE SHEPHERDS' RUN

56:03.542 --> 56:05.082
- Alfred!
- Eberle!

56:05.250 --> 56:07.739
Good that you could make it.
Have you eaten?

56:07.917 --> 56:09.409
When does it start?

56:09.583 --> 56:12.119
It's about to start.

56:13.750 --> 56:17.281
Listen up, everyone! The screening
will start in five minutes' time.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.496
First come, first served.

56:19.667 --> 56:21.325
Let's go then.

56:24.292 --> 56:25.701
One after another.

56:25.875 --> 56:28.079
Like a farmer
eating dumplings.

56:28.250 --> 56:31.118
No, no, Elmar.
You have to get in line too.

56:38.375 --> 56:39.489
Leonhard.

56:39.667 --> 56:41.124
We saved you a space.

56:42.292 --> 56:45.373
I took part in the Shepherds' Run.
Maybe I'm in the film.

56:45.542 --> 56:47.698
There's free beer
and a sausage stew.

56:47.875 --> 56:51.999
We only have turnip at home,
but we're decent people.

56:53.667 --> 56:54.661
So?

56:55.750 --> 56:58.321
You'll have to decide, son.

57:08.542 --> 57:10.865
National comrades,
I'll keep it short.

57:11.042 --> 57:13.328
I know you're more
excited about the film

57:13.500 --> 57:15.372
than Eberle's speech.

57:16.542 --> 57:19.623
However, today we
witness once again

57:19.792 --> 57:22.908
how the Führer brings us
technological progress.

57:23.083 --> 57:25.702
Even the most remote
parts of the German Reich

57:25.875 --> 57:27.949
will see wealth and comfort.

57:28.125 --> 57:30.246
That's right.
Bravo!

57:30.417 --> 57:33.580
Within three years,
we will all have our own radio set,

57:33.750 --> 57:36.203
connecting us
to modern times.

57:36.875 --> 57:38.498
I promise you,

57:38.667 --> 57:43.490
all of the village's streets
will be paved and lit.

57:48.625 --> 57:50.283
This is progress.

57:50.458 --> 57:52.414
This is our Führer, Adolf Hitler.

57:52.583 --> 57:54.343
- Sieg...
- Heil!

57:54.465 --> 57:56.000
- Sieg...
- Heil!

57:56.169 --> 57:57.664
- Sieg...
- Heil!

57:58.583 --> 58:02.956
And now, our wonderful Shepherds'
Run as a motion picture.

58:03.125 --> 58:04.120
Please.

58:57.542 --> 58:58.536
Georgie.

59:00.167 --> 59:03.330
You're lucky you can still
move freely in the village.

59:38.875 --> 59:42.572
You claim to have organised
your own gunpowder plates.

59:42.750 --> 59:45.036
Where exactly did
you get them from?

59:46.417 --> 59:50.197
Before deciding on the
actual details of my plan,

59:50.375 --> 59:53.823
I used my position
at the steel works

59:54.000 --> 59:57.661
to steal a total of 250 pieces
of pressed gunpowder.

59:57.833 --> 01:00:00.997
How do you know it
was exactly 250 pieces?

01:00:01.167 --> 01:00:02.790
I counted them.

01:00:02.958 --> 01:00:04.499
Who else knew about this?

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:08.411
Nobody. The theft was not
discovered by the company.

01:00:08.583 --> 01:00:12.956
I wrapped the powder in paper
and hid it in my wardrobe at home.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.872
And the dynamite?

01:00:16.042 --> 01:00:18.577
I stole it from the
quarry at night.

01:00:19.958 --> 01:00:22.707
What was the name
of your boss?

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.240
I can't remember.

01:00:26.417 --> 01:00:28.656
I only met the man
three or four times.

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:34.872
If you don't talk,
they can have you shot,

01:00:35.042 --> 01:00:36.867
any time,
up there in the yard.

01:00:37.667 --> 01:00:39.906
It's true.
I'm not covering up for anyone.

01:00:40.083 --> 01:00:42.998
Do you really think we
won't uncover everything?

01:00:43.167 --> 01:00:45.241
No, Mr Nebe, I don't.

01:00:45.417 --> 01:00:48.119
That's why I'm completely
honest with you.

01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:23.370
And?

01:01:23.542 --> 01:01:26.872
We inquire about a monumental
attack and the Swiss send this.

01:01:27.042 --> 01:01:29.956
"The proprietor describes
Elser as hard-working.

01:01:30.125 --> 01:01:34.533
"It was noted he often left work
to go swimming in the afternoons.

01:01:35.208 --> 01:01:38.290
"He more than made up for the
missing time in the evenings.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:41.125
"We have no knowledge
of Elser's acquaintances. "

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.497
Take your hands
off your face!

01:02:02.875 --> 01:02:07.367
Dot, dot, comma, swish,

01:02:07.542 --> 01:02:10.374
makes a face
round like a dish.

01:02:10.542 --> 01:02:11.821
What about the hair?

01:02:18.333 --> 01:02:20.324
What about the ears?

01:02:23.917 --> 01:02:24.995
Iris!

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:26.707
I found something!

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:37.870
The marshals will come on Monday.
We'll have to leave our home.

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:41.740
I sometimes wonder
how it would be with you.

01:02:42.708 --> 01:02:44.498
You and me together.

01:02:45.333 --> 01:02:47.324
You could play
in an orchestra.

01:02:48.458 --> 01:02:49.620
Maybe in Switzerland.

01:02:49.792 --> 01:02:52.706
Or in America,
they pay more there.

01:02:57.208 --> 01:02:59.164
Are you serious
about me, Georgie?

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.998
This might be the first time
I'm serious about anyone.

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:06.950
I'm pregnant again.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:19.249
Don't. The children mustn't find out.
They talk a lot at home.

01:03:21.208 --> 01:03:22.618
I think it's your child.

01:03:23.458 --> 01:03:26.291
But I haven't always been
able to fend off Erich.

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:30.404
I prayed for the Lord to take the child,
regardless of whether it's yours or his.

01:03:30.583 --> 01:03:32.124
You mustn't say that, Elsa.

01:03:32.917 --> 01:03:35.286
Who will feed the child?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.571
Why can't they let us
be how we want?

01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:45.499
You have to get a divorce.

01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:50.328
Am I supposed to move in with you,
now that they're taking your home?

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.909
Where will you live now?

01:04:25.375 --> 01:04:28.290
Uncle! Mummy says you'll
sleep in our basement.

01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:30.165
I'm not your uncle.
I'm Georgie.

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:34.658
Are you going to paint faces and
protect me from the bogeyman?

01:04:34.833 --> 01:04:39.537
If he comes, I'll get my accordion and
play so terribly that he runs away.

01:04:41.083 --> 01:04:42.659
Mummy, Georgie is here.

01:04:47.875 --> 01:04:50.992
And, very important:
no female visitors. Understood?

01:04:51.167 --> 01:04:54.367
Your reputation isn't the best,
but I must protect mine.

01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:56.947
That's why I won't
tolerate anything.

01:05:03.667 --> 01:05:06.997
So it's free board and lodging
until the furniture is finished,

01:05:07.167 --> 01:05:08.446
and then 20 a month.

01:05:09.417 --> 01:05:10.826
Sign it.

01:05:17.708 --> 01:05:19.450
So this is it.

01:05:21.708 --> 01:05:24.623
There's a mattress in the other
room that you can have.

01:05:25.625 --> 01:05:28.742
I'll clean the window for you, Georgie.
To make it brighter.

01:05:28.917 --> 01:05:30.954
My wife doesn't
clean for lodgers.

01:05:31.125 --> 01:05:33.613
First we need
to oil the hinges.

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:37.372
If you can't pay

01:05:37.542 --> 01:05:40.872
or you breach the contract,
you'll have to move out.

01:05:41.625 --> 01:05:44.160
- Understood?
- I'll always find work.

01:05:48.792 --> 01:05:50.948
Come on!
Beat it!

01:06:14.708 --> 01:06:18.287
I'M THE BIGGEST PIG AROUND
AS I MIX WITH JEWS IN TOWN

01:06:18.792 --> 01:06:20.284
But, Lore...

01:06:21.333 --> 01:06:22.530
What's all this about?

01:06:23.375 --> 01:06:25.330
You can join her if you like.

01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:33.207
Get lost!

01:06:44.708 --> 01:06:46.284
It's not my birthday.

01:06:50.167 --> 01:06:53.662
I bet they wear this in Ulm,
or even in Stuttgart.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.199
You're crazy.

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:00.411
Thank you.

01:07:02.667 --> 01:07:05.783
Shall I take it up like this?
Or maybe even shorter?

01:07:05.958 --> 01:07:06.953
Shorter is nice.

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:08.831
But don't wear it
when Erich's around.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.323
Don't worry,
it's just for you.

01:07:15.042 --> 01:07:16.036
What's wrong?

01:07:17.417 --> 01:07:21.410
They sat Lore in the square
with a sign round her neck.

01:07:21.583 --> 01:07:22.993
Because of her boyfriend?

01:07:24.167 --> 01:07:25.743
Poor thing.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:28.575
But there's nothing we can do.

01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:30.784
It's getting worse and worse.

01:07:50.958 --> 01:07:51.953
Elsa...

01:08:20.457 --> 01:08:21.832
It's Schurr!

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:46.956
I can't be seen with people.

01:08:47.625 --> 01:08:49.698
Come on in.
Hurry.

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:07.617
After the Heuberg concentration camp
they sent us to work at satellite camps.

01:09:07.792 --> 01:09:10.576
There was at least one
death every week.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:15.747
- Where are you working now?
- At the steel works.

01:09:15.917 --> 01:09:19.697
I get out every two weeks for
good behaviour, but mustn't see anyone.

01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:21.072
Gosh!

01:09:25.042 --> 01:09:27.495
And you? Out of work,
being at home at this time?

01:09:27.667 --> 01:09:30.416
Self-employed.
But it's hard, not being a Nazi.

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:32.621
The steel works are hiring.

01:09:32.792 --> 01:09:35.541
But be careful.
They toe the party line.

01:09:37.167 --> 01:09:38.624
There.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.037
You do realise we
fed a camp inmate?

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:47.533
If the Gestapo come I'll tell
the pricks it's my bread.

01:09:47.707 --> 01:09:51.287
- I do what I want with it.
- But you're living in our home.

01:09:51.457 --> 01:09:54.029
If the Gestapo come,
we're all in for it.

01:09:57.958 --> 01:10:00.494
You didn't need so many
fuses to detonate the bomb.

01:10:01.208 --> 01:10:05.581
Correct. I knew two or three
gunpowder plates would suffice.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:08.831
But I thought the extra ones
would increase the explosion.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.037
Why two clockworks
in the bomb?

01:10:11.208 --> 01:10:15.533
I didn't want to rely on just one
clockwork for my plan to succeed.

01:10:15.708 --> 01:10:18.113
Matching the 12 combs (B)
of cogwheel (A),

01:10:18.292 --> 01:10:22.416
I was able to set each clock
with its run-time of 14 days

01:10:22.583 --> 01:10:24.787
144 hours or 6 days
in advance,

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:28.573
accurate within 15 minutes,
to the time of the explosion, 21:20,

01:10:28.750 --> 01:10:30.408
and activate it.

01:10:31.875 --> 01:10:33.617
All of 13 minutes
were missing.

01:10:36.458 --> 01:10:38.330
How did you build
the detonator?

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.996
The block with the three inserted
and sharpened nails (N)

01:10:42.167 --> 01:10:46.160
hits the bolt (U), on which it has been
loosely set, before the spring (V).

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:50.448
The tips (W)) then hit
the cartridges opposite,

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:53.742
thus igniting through the impact
on the cartridge primers

01:10:53.917 --> 01:10:58.206
the blasting caps (Y), inserted at
a short distance from them.

01:10:59.208 --> 01:11:00.582
The charge detonates.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.161
And?

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:17.906
This ignition head requires
a pressure of 35 kilopond.

01:11:18.083 --> 01:11:21.828
The spring is set to 40 kilopond.
Everything matches exactly.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.868
This Elser works intuitively
and very accurately.

01:11:25.042 --> 01:11:27.660
Everybody knows you
need pressure to detonate.

01:11:27.833 --> 01:11:30.322
Elser must have
had instructions.

01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:33.996
Technically, he conceived and
built the bomb all on his own.

01:11:34.167 --> 01:11:38.658
If you know all the parameters,
you don't need any help or instructions.

01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:41.120
This man knows what
he's talking about.

01:11:41.292 --> 01:11:43.661
10, 15, 20.

01:11:51.333 --> 01:11:54.284
Come here.
Get lost! Beat it!

01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:57.581
You're hurting me.

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.159
You're hurting me!

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:10.166
OUR GREETING:
"HEIL HITLER!"

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:23.703
Josef!

01:12:26.708 --> 01:12:28.948
What's the big secret
they're hiding?

01:12:29.125 --> 01:12:32.206
I'm not sure yet, it might be
moulds for ignition heads.

01:12:33.333 --> 01:12:35.620
Do you think you can
earn your money talking?

01:12:36.542 --> 01:12:39.872
Any contact with the forced
labourers is prohibited.

01:12:42.375 --> 01:12:45.823
Workers of the world, unite!

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:51.285
This is Radio Moscow in
German on 25m short-wave.

01:12:51.458 --> 01:12:55.037
On April 26, 1937,

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:58.242
Adolf Hitler ordered
his Condor Legion

01:12:58.417 --> 01:13:01.201
to bomb the Spanish
town of Guernica.

01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:04.787
Never before has such
a devastating attack

01:13:04.958 --> 01:13:06.949
on a civilian target
area been witnessed.

01:13:07.125 --> 01:13:11.531
At least 260
people were shot,

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:13.932
torn to pieces or
burned to death.

01:13:13.967 --> 01:13:17.659
Guernica's destruction is a violation of
international law and an important step...

01:13:23.292 --> 01:13:25.697
I've had it with this
wretched scum.

01:13:28.292 --> 01:13:30.081
Why do they all follow
this gangster?

01:13:31.458 --> 01:13:34.705
They're the master race now.
They think the Nazis make it better.

01:13:34.875 --> 01:13:36.451
Nothing's better.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.491
GERMAN TANKS

01:14:01.417 --> 01:14:03.407
German domination in the air

01:14:03.583 --> 01:14:07.743
is not just due to the outstanding
aviators of the Luftwaffe,

01:14:07.917 --> 01:14:11.780
but also to the tremendous contributions
of the aviation industry.

01:14:21.708 --> 01:14:26.745
As Führer and Chancellor of
the German nation and the Reich,

01:14:26.917 --> 01:14:29.784
I hereby announce
to German history

01:14:29.958 --> 01:14:34.580
the accession of my homeland
to the German Reich.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:37.127
- Sieg Heil!
- Sieg Heil!

01:14:51.125 --> 01:14:54.288
JEWS NOT WELCOME
VILLAGE OF KÖNIGSBRONN

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:57.284
They want war.

01:14:57.458 --> 01:15:00.409
It'll be brutal.
They're building tanks as piecework.

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.787
Maybe it'll be like
Bohemia and Moravia.

01:15:02.958 --> 01:15:05.529
With Hitler attacking
England and France?

01:15:05.708 --> 01:15:08.113
We'll all die and the
country with us.

01:15:08.292 --> 01:15:09.998
I'm a forced labourer, Georgie.

01:15:10.167 --> 01:15:11.825
We really ought
to do something.

01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.200
But what?
Blow up the Special Unit?

01:15:15.375 --> 01:15:18.622
That would only mean dead workers
and the Nazis would carry on.

01:15:18.792 --> 01:15:21.955
We have to do something else,
and soon.

01:15:22.125 --> 01:15:23.831
Soon and radical.

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.457
Attack the leadership.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:29.289
You'll need guns
or dynamite.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:33.155
There's dynamite up in the quarry
and detonators here in the factory.

01:15:33.333 --> 01:15:38.037
- Someone has to stop this madness.
- Yes, but not you or me or us.

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:41.704
Hitler must be stopped by
other countries, by generals.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.664
We're not strong enough, Georg.

01:15:44.292 --> 01:15:46.531
We can't wait
till it's too late.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.201
It has to happen.

01:16:16.042 --> 01:16:17.664
What's wrong?

01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:20.535
I can't stand you doing
it with this drunkard.

01:16:27.500 --> 01:16:29.739
There's nothing I can do.

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:45.155
You filthy whore!

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:47.618
You slut!

01:16:52.458 --> 01:16:55.029
Just one more, you swine,
just one more.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.244
I'll kill you.

01:17:00.417 --> 01:17:03.747
I'll kill you, both of you.

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:06.707
Both of you.

01:17:12.458 --> 01:17:14.034
Elsa?

01:17:19.375 --> 01:17:20.784
How's the child?

01:17:20.958 --> 01:17:23.114
- It's kicking.
- Thank God.

01:17:24.625 --> 01:17:25.952
What happens now?

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:28.162
This here is over.
Just come with me.

01:17:28.333 --> 01:17:30.904
Where to?
To your mother?

01:17:31.083 --> 01:17:33.157
So we all go to heaven?

01:17:33.333 --> 01:17:35.869
There's no room
for me there.

01:17:41.333 --> 01:17:44.450
I now work piece rate.
It's better money.

01:17:44.625 --> 01:17:47.457
It'll be enough if I repair
furniture on the side.

01:17:48.667 --> 01:17:51.036
There are cheap flats
in Heidenheim now.

01:17:51.208 --> 01:17:53.282
Only for Labour Front workers.

01:17:58.833 --> 01:18:00.539
Not for you.

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:36.827
BÜRGERBRÄU ADDRESS.
THE FÜHRER SPEAKS!

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:43.454
THE FÜHRER SPEAKS

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:05.953
TIMETABLE

01:19:30.417 --> 01:19:33.912
MUNICH 1938

01:19:37.333 --> 01:19:39.205
We've checked everything.

01:21:18.292 --> 01:21:23.743
A talented worker such as yourself
should be a staunch National Socialist.

01:21:23.917 --> 01:21:27.033
It's obvious that the Nazis
don't support the people.

01:21:27.208 --> 01:21:30.372
Today, a carpenter's hourly
wage is 68 Pfennigs.

01:21:30.542 --> 01:21:33.030
In 1929 it was 1 Mark and 5.

01:21:33.208 --> 01:21:37.782
You're not trying to tell us that our
Führer isn't looking after workers.

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:40.123
Hitler is bad for Germany.

01:21:40.292 --> 01:21:43.622
- Have you gone completely insane?
- It's true though.

01:21:43.792 --> 01:21:46.540
He's sending dissenters
to concentration camps.

01:21:46.708 --> 01:21:50.702
And the Jews are being robbed and
tortured just because of their faith.

01:21:50.875 --> 01:21:52.498
To cleanse the population.

01:21:52.667 --> 01:21:54.574
Your blitzkrieg was
a brutal attack.

01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:57.664
Poland will be annihilated,
Hitler will incorporate it.

01:21:57.833 --> 01:21:59.290
That's the law of
the strongest.

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:01.374
It's always been like this.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:04.244
Do you really think there'll
be no consequences?

01:22:05.625 --> 01:22:08.990
France and England declared
war on us on September 3rd.

01:22:09.167 --> 01:22:13.207
Soon, a terrible fire will steamroll
Germany and destroy everything.

01:22:13.375 --> 01:22:15.614
Endless amounts of
blood will be shed.

01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:18.197
Then the bombs
will drop on us, too.

01:22:19.375 --> 01:22:21.531
Can't you see
what's happening?

01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:24.912
You're suffering
from paranoia.

01:22:25.083 --> 01:22:26.908
And what about
the victims?

01:22:27.083 --> 01:22:29.488
Hitler always talks
about destiny.

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:33.281
So you National Socialists, too,
must have a higher law.

01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:35.283
And it states,
"thou shalt not kill".

01:22:35.458 --> 01:22:40.246
That's rich, coming from someone
who murdered eight innocent people.

01:22:41.667 --> 01:22:44.913
Yes, you heard right.

01:22:45.083 --> 01:22:48.413
Last night, the injured
Schmeidel died as well.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:56.329
I only wanted to prevent
even more bloodshed.

01:22:58.958 --> 01:23:01.790
I knew it would not just
hit the highest ranks.

01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:06.657
But it had to be done.

01:23:07.791 --> 01:23:09.201
All right, take this down.

01:23:10.625 --> 01:23:13.457
The considerations
I undertook

01:23:14.416 --> 01:23:19.750
led to the conclusion that
conditions in Germany

01:23:19.916 --> 01:23:24.263
could only be changed
by extinguishing...

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:28.956
- ... the current leadership.
- I said the highest ranks.

01:23:29.449 --> 01:23:31.619
Very well,
the highest ranks, then.

01:23:31.791 --> 01:23:33.368
By this, I mean...

01:23:36.041 --> 01:23:38.447
By this, I mean Hitler
and all the government.

01:23:38.625 --> 01:23:40.283
I am the sole perpetrator.

01:23:41.416 --> 01:23:44.782
I procured the necessary means
for the attack on my own.

01:23:44.958 --> 01:23:48.655
I was working entirely alone.

01:23:48.833 --> 01:23:50.409
Correct.

01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:54.824
And, funnily enough,
nobody would have joined me.

01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:04.073
You will regret this, Elser.

01:24:13.125 --> 01:24:15.448
Miss Secretary,
may I ask you something?

01:24:15.625 --> 01:24:16.952
You're not allowed.

01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:19.613
I know you're not
wholly unmoved.

01:24:19.791 --> 01:24:20.905
Please.

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:28.660
I would be grateful if you could pass
on my condolences to the relatives,

01:24:28.833 --> 01:24:30.740
my heartfelt condolences.

01:24:30.916 --> 01:24:32.954
I think about them all day.

01:24:34.833 --> 01:24:39.490
And, if possible, tell Elsa and my
family that I'm well at the moment.

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:42.330
And that I'm praying for
the Lord to protect them.

01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:47.908
And that I accept sole
responsibility for everything.

01:24:48.083 --> 01:24:50.536
Could you pass
that on, please?

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:59.159
You can't get any more
out of him than the truth.

01:25:01.375 --> 01:25:03.164
We make the truth.

01:25:03.333 --> 01:25:05.075
You're not normally so soft.

01:25:25.166 --> 01:25:27.536
It's from the file. Put it away.
You didn't get it from me.

01:25:33.541 --> 01:25:35.034
That'll do for today.

01:25:36.541 --> 01:25:38.034
Take him away.

01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:40.414
Thank you.

01:26:55.375 --> 01:26:57.863
And, what did
you have, a boy?

01:27:18.541 --> 01:27:20.947
A boy.
He's ours.

01:27:21.791 --> 01:27:23.249
I can see it.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:26.621
I already told Erich
he'll be called Georg.

01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:28.286
He was shouting.

01:27:28.458 --> 01:27:31.077
But I signed the
midwife's certificate.

01:27:50.833 --> 01:27:53.073
- You get some rest now.
- Stay.

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:54.956
Erich has gone drinking.

01:27:55.125 --> 01:27:57.246
I have to get to work, Elsa.

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.330
The prisoner to the left, please,
with the gentlemen at the table.

01:28:39.791 --> 01:28:41.782
The Oberführer
on the left, please.

01:28:44.583 --> 01:28:47.664
If the prisoner could point
to the schematic, please.

01:28:47.833 --> 01:28:50.831
And if the Oberführer could
bend down a little, please.

01:29:01.208 --> 01:29:03.744
You stated the Führer
was bad for Germany.

01:29:03.916 --> 01:29:04.911
That's right.

01:29:06.041 --> 01:29:08.790
Heil Hitler!
Heil the Führer!

01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:12.454
Our Führer made Germany great
and will lead us on to glory.

01:29:12.625 --> 01:29:16.156
He is the greatest leader and won't
die until our destiny is fulfilled.

01:29:16.333 --> 01:29:18.786
What is a worm like you
to do with such a man?

01:29:18.958 --> 01:29:21.529
What lunatic has controlled you,
you imbecile?

01:29:22.708 --> 01:29:24.533
It's like I said.

01:29:45.791 --> 01:29:49.204
The Führer demands to know
who instigated this fool to act.

01:29:49.375 --> 01:29:52.041
Have him hypnotised,
drug him, I don't care.

01:29:52.208 --> 01:29:55.870
Use any means that our scientists
have been working on.

01:29:56.666 --> 01:29:58.823
The Führer wants to
know who set it up.

01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.623
He wants to know
who's behind this.

01:30:01.666 --> 01:30:03.657
His patience has run out.

01:31:19.125 --> 01:31:22.039
I could stay with my mother
for a while after the divorce.

01:31:22.208 --> 01:31:24.080
What do you think?

01:31:25.708 --> 01:31:28.327
She'll have the children.
There's work in Esslingen.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:31.071
You can come down from
Munich on weekends.

01:31:36.666 --> 01:31:39.700
I must know if you really
want this, Georgie.

01:31:41.541 --> 01:31:43.449
I love you.

01:31:45.958 --> 01:31:47.367
Elsa...

01:31:48.416 --> 01:31:50.490
The boy...

01:33:01.166 --> 01:33:02.624
Georgie!

01:33:03.916 --> 01:33:05.196
Georgie.

01:33:08.791 --> 01:33:10.829
So you're off to Munich.

01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:13.951
Without a goodbye,
just like that.

01:33:15.541 --> 01:33:17.034
Don't move.

01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:31.870
So you do have
something in Munich.

01:33:32.041 --> 01:33:33.451
And it's decided?

01:33:34.333 --> 01:33:36.489
It's just for a short while.

01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:38.989
I love you, Georgie,
but I have no choice.

01:33:40.166 --> 01:33:42.489
I can take a lot,
but the children are hungry.

01:33:42.666 --> 01:33:45.036
I'd give you money,
but I need it for Munich.

01:33:47.208 --> 01:33:49.744
Elsa, wait for me.
Be faithful to me.

01:33:50.833 --> 01:33:52.658
I've got something planned.

01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:55.997
I can't tell you what,
but it's vital, and it'll be fine.

01:33:58.125 --> 01:34:00.162
I want to marry you
when it's all over.

01:34:00.333 --> 01:34:03.450
We'll move to Switzerland
with the children.

01:34:03.625 --> 01:34:05.201
Think of the dancing.

01:34:05.375 --> 01:34:06.951
It's not about dreams.

01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.074
It's about life, Georgie.

01:34:11.166 --> 01:34:13.951
I know you left
women before me.

01:34:15.916 --> 01:34:19.578
Then I'll just have to be
a single mother forever.

01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:42.579
I can't hear what
you're saying.

01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:44.575
Tell us the names.

01:34:47.541 --> 01:34:48.785
The names.

01:34:50.583 --> 01:34:51.745
No...

01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:11.115
The name!
Who provided the cartridges?

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:14.950
Who supplied the explosives?

01:35:15.125 --> 01:35:16.238
I can't hear you.

01:35:20.458 --> 01:35:21.832
You bastard!

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:28.663
The names, Elser!
Tell us the names!

01:35:28.833 --> 01:35:31.665
Heil! Heil! Heil!

01:35:31.833 --> 01:35:33.207
I did it on my own.

01:35:34.416 --> 01:35:36.537
Nobody helped me.

01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:48.489
I shall try and atone

01:35:48.666 --> 01:35:52.742
for the bad things
that I have done.

01:35:54.375 --> 01:35:55.832
By doing what?

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.492
And how?

01:35:58.958 --> 01:36:01.245
By trying to...

01:36:03.416 --> 01:36:06.201
By trying to integrate
myself into...

01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:11.826
...the national community
and work within it.

01:36:13.083 --> 01:36:14.955
Would you be able to?

01:36:18.750 --> 01:36:20.824
I changed my conviction.

01:36:22.291 --> 01:36:25.408
Because you were arrested.

01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:27.659
No.

01:36:29.833 --> 01:36:33.697
I'm certain my plan
would have succeeded,

01:36:33.875 --> 01:36:37.406
if my conviction
had been right.

01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:41.661
Since it hasn't succeeded,

01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.365
I'm convinced it wasn't
meant to succeed

01:36:47.541 --> 01:36:50.374
and that my conviction
was wrong.

01:38:01.625 --> 01:38:02.620
Take him away.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.872
Can I see a priest?

01:38:06.833 --> 01:38:08.290
No.

01:38:24.041 --> 01:38:26.790
5 YEARS LATER

01:38:27.916 --> 01:38:30.487
SPRING 1945

01:38:34.791 --> 01:38:39.413
BERLIN,
PLÖTZENSEE EXECUTION SITE

01:38:43.083 --> 01:38:48.582
"The First Senate of the People's Court
ruled on March 2nd, 1945:

01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:53.241
"The former SS Gruppenführer and
Lieutenant General of Police Arthur Nebe

01:38:53.416 --> 01:38:55.870
is of thoroughly
flawed character.

01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.786
"He took part in the
conspiracy of July 20th.

01:38:58.958 --> 01:39:01.447
"He supported the attempt
on the Führer's life,

01:39:01.625 --> 01:39:06.745
and was willing to assist the coup
by providing police personnel.

01:39:06.916 --> 01:39:11.040
"He is sentenced to death for high treason
and will forever be without honour.

01:39:11.875 --> 01:39:14.410
"His estate will go to the Reich. "

01:41:05.250 --> 01:41:09.113
SPECIAL OCCURRENCES:

01:41:09.291 --> 01:41:11.116
NONE

01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:18.696
DACHAU CONCENTRATION CAMP

01:41:22.125 --> 01:41:26.284
SPECIAL PRISONER WARD

01:41:31.708 --> 01:41:33.450
Nebe was executed
a few days ago.

01:41:37.250 --> 01:41:38.447
Did you hear me?
Nebe's dead.

01:41:39.041 --> 01:41:40.285
At Plötzensee.

01:41:41.875 --> 01:41:44.659
- How do you know?
- From the new inmates, as usual.

01:41:46.041 --> 01:41:49.372
They strung up Nebe?
Why?

01:41:49.541 --> 01:41:54.282
He designated policemen for Stauffenberg
to arrest all ministers after the coup.

01:41:56.708 --> 01:42:00.488
So much for the great show trial that
Goebbels wanted to put on for you.

01:42:01.416 --> 01:42:04.201
It'll soon be over for me, too.

01:42:04.375 --> 01:42:06.780
At least you got a few
more years out of them.

01:42:10.208 --> 01:42:13.076
If only I knew what
happened to Elsa.

01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:16.164
You keep asking about that woman.
How should I know?

01:42:17.041 --> 01:42:18.238
With so many people dying.

01:42:18.833 --> 01:42:20.871
She's not necessarily dead.

01:42:21.666 --> 01:42:24.368
She might be alive,
imprisoned somewhere.

01:42:26.541 --> 01:42:27.951
There's also good news.

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:31.782
'The College of Music for the Disabled'
has accepted me.

01:42:31.958 --> 01:42:33.748
I'll learn how to sing now.

01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:39.372
Viennese songs for zither.

01:42:39.541 --> 01:42:43.582
As a little 'thank-you' for recommending
I try the College of Music.

01:42:49.916 --> 01:42:52.286
<i>You were young</i>

01:42:52.458 --> 01:42:54.662
<i>I was young</i>

01:42:54.833 --> 01:42:58.530
<i>Now it's all gone</i>

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:04.787
<i>Only the memories</i>

01:43:04.958 --> 01:43:10.113
<i>Are all that carries on</i>

01:43:10.291 --> 01:43:12.531
<i>You were pretty</i>

01:43:12.708 --> 01:43:14.948
<i>I was smart</i>

01:43:15.125 --> 01:43:19.414
<i>And so in love</i>

01:43:20.208 --> 01:43:24.118
<i>Think back to the places</i>

01:43:24.291 --> 01:43:27.953
<i>To the sweetest faces</i>

01:43:29.125 --> 01:43:33.332
<i>Just because there's
nothing you can place above</i>

01:43:39.958 --> 01:43:42.363
Franz, you know
about these things.

01:43:42.541 --> 01:43:44.947
What's quicker:

01:43:45.125 --> 01:43:49.035
gas, hanging,
or being shot in the neck?

01:43:54.958 --> 01:43:56.996
I've been waiting for so long.

01:43:58.541 --> 01:44:01.112
It might as well
be over quickly.

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.325
...hallowed be thy name.

01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.289
Thy kingdom come.
Thy will be done

01:44:08.416 --> 01:44:10.822
on earth as it
is in heaven.

01:44:11.000 --> 01:44:12.706
Give us this day
our daily bread,

01:44:12.875 --> 01:44:14.996
and forgive us
our trespasses...

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:17.572
The English reduced
Dresden to rubble.

01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:19.989
Not one building
is left standing.

01:44:20.166 --> 01:44:22.785
One hundred thousand
civilians killed in one night.

01:44:22.958 --> 01:44:24.155
For thine is the kingdom...

01:44:24.333 --> 01:44:25.742
Praying is pointless.

01:44:25.916 --> 01:44:27.907
God is in America or in Moscow.
He won't hear you.

01:44:31.041 --> 01:44:34.075
How can one man
fail as horribly as I?

01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:41.761
Prisoner Elser,
for interrogation!

01:45:05.666 --> 01:45:09.281
During one of the next terror attacks
on Munich or the Dachau area,

01:45:09.458 --> 01:45:11.283
Elser will allegedly
suffer a fatal accident.

01:45:12.250 --> 01:45:16.032
I therefore ask you to
secretly liquidate Elser,

01:45:16.115 --> 01:45:19.154
when this situation arises.

01:45:19.375 --> 01:45:25.075
Make sure that only very few specially
selected personnel know about this.

01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:28.994
The incident report filed to me
should read along the lines of:

01:45:29.166 --> 01:45:31.619
"On following the
terror attack on,

01:45:31.791 --> 01:45:35.488
"special prisoner Elser, among others,
was fatally injured. "

01:45:35.666 --> 01:45:38.997
You must destroy this letter once you
have taken note and carried this out.

01:46:05.607 --> 01:46:09.934

01:46:10.169 --> 01:46:12.852
A FEW DAYS LATER,
ON APRIL 29, 1945,

01:46:12.887 --> 01:46:15.436
THE DACHAU CONCENTRATION CAMP
WAS LIBERATED.

01:46:15.865 --> 01:46:18.167
STARTED BY HITLER,

01:46:18.202 --> 01:46:20.961
THE SECOND WORLD WAR CLAIMED
AT LEAST 55 MILLION LIVES.

01:46:20.996 --> 01:46:23.713
IT TOOK DECADES
FOR GERMANY

01:46:23.748 --> 01:46:26.793
TO RECOGNISE GEORG ELSER
AS A RESISTANCE FIGHTER.

01:46:27.586 --> 01:46:30.396
FOLLOWING HER DIVORCE,

01:46:30.431 --> 01:46:33.139
ELSA WAS MARRIED
TWO MORE TIMES.

01:46:33.174 --> 01:46:36.393
SHE DIED IN WIESENSTEIG
ON OCTOBER 11, 1994.

01:46:36.428 --> 01:46:39.914
SHE NEVER GOT OVER GEORG ELSER,
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE.

01:46:43.197 --> 01:46:49.197
Johann Georg Elser
January 4, 1903 - April 9, 1945

01:49:02.250 --> 01:49:07.405
13 MINUTES

01:49:15.750 --> 01:49:18.731
THIS FILM WAS BASED
ON HISTORICAL EVENTS.

01:49:18.766 --> 01:49:22.145
SOME SCENES FROM GEORG ELSER'S
PERSONAL LIFE WERE FICTIONALISED.
