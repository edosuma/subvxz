WEBVTT

00:14.147 --> 00:16.081
What took you so long?
I was in bed.

00:16.083 --> 00:18.017
I was gonna sleep in.
It's Sunday morning.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.151
When'd you get into town?

00:19.153 --> 00:21.453
Yesterday.
Hmm.

00:21.455 --> 00:23.322
"yesterday."
so, why didn't you call,

00:23.324 --> 00:24.623
Tell me you were coming?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.625
What about a hug?

00:30.330 --> 00:31.663
You look good.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.665
Let's get a taxi.

00:33.667 --> 00:35.100
What? Where are we going?

00:35.102 --> 00:36.168
Brunch.

00:36.170 --> 00:37.302
Great french bistro

00:37.304 --> 00:39.071
Over in georgetown.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.372
Well, I could've met you there.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.241
Why did...? We could...

00:42.243 --> 00:43.675
What are you up to?

00:43.677 --> 00:45.444
I've got some great news.

00:45.446 --> 00:47.179
Oh. Tell me.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.614
Patience, junior.

00:48.616 --> 00:51.083
Wait till we get
to the restaurant.

00:51.085 --> 00:52.317
I don't think so.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.318
Dad, tell me.

00:53.320 --> 00:54.319
Sorry.

00:54.321 --> 00:56.655
No problem.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.190
Commander!
Huh?

00:58.192 --> 00:59.491
You have a second?
Not really.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.626
I'm running late.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.295
Ncis. Got to ask you a question.

01:04.330 --> 01:06.098
Coming, junior?
Hold on.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.199
Dad, I've got to...

01:07.201 --> 01:08.333
Hey!

01:08.335 --> 01:09.568
Dad, stay there!

01:09.570 --> 01:11.703
(tires squealing, horns honking)

01:14.507 --> 01:16.241
Tony:
Hey!

01:16.243 --> 01:17.609
Back off, pal!

01:17.611 --> 01:18.844
Whoa.

01:18.846 --> 01:20.312
Easy.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.549
What the hell's going on?

01:23.551 --> 01:25.117
No!

01:25.119 --> 01:27.286
(groaning)

02:14.901 --> 02:16.201
All right. Done.

02:16.203 --> 02:17.302
Thanks, tim.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.737
When I've bagged
that other hand,

02:18.739 --> 02:21.206
We'll prepare him
for transportation.

02:21.208 --> 02:23.809
If mr. Palmer ever gets here.

02:23.811 --> 02:24.810
Did you find any I.D.?

02:24.812 --> 02:26.512
His pockets were curiously empty

02:26.514 --> 02:28.680
Except for these.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.349
Keys.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.917
Jimmy:
Sorry it took so long,

02:31.919 --> 02:34.186
Dr. Mallard.
I had to let breena know

02:34.188 --> 02:35.554
I wouldn't be able
to join her parents for lunch.

02:35.556 --> 02:37.389
We're all suffering
from Sunday interruptus,

02:37.391 --> 02:38.824
Mr. Palmer.
(device beeping)

02:38.826 --> 02:41.493
Tony:
<i>It just struck me as strange.</i>

02:41.495 --> 02:44.663
The stripes on his sleeve were
those of a lieutenant commander,

02:44.665 --> 02:47.266
But the ones
embroidered on his visor

02:47.268 --> 02:48.867
Were full commander.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.702
Who notices something like that?

02:50.704 --> 02:52.237
Gibbs:
Mr. Dinozzo.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.906
Please, just
give us a minute.

02:53.908 --> 02:55.707
Sorry.

02:55.709 --> 02:56.875
(sighs)
it was weird.

02:56.877 --> 02:57.943
He just didn't fit the profile

02:57.945 --> 02:59.211
Of a navy officer, you know?

02:59.213 --> 03:02.181
He didn't put his cover on.
His shoes--

03:02.183 --> 03:03.782
I mean, they were scuffed,
not polished.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.384
You know what?
I think you're right, tony.

03:05.386 --> 03:06.518
I ran the victim's print.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.753
He's not in
any military database.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.321
Hang on.
Let's first find out

03:09.323 --> 03:11.290
Who he is
and what he was doing

03:11.292 --> 03:12.925
Impersonating a navy officer,
all right?

03:12.927 --> 03:14.560
Hotel's cameras
aren't gonna be of any help.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.428
Could just be a coincidence,
but the whole system

03:16.430 --> 03:18.297
Crashed about an hour ago.
Tony:
Rule number 39.

03:18.299 --> 03:19.798
No such thing
as a coincidence, bishop.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.333
Ah, bishop.

03:21.335 --> 03:23.435
Go corral tony's
father, will you?

03:23.437 --> 03:25.437
He is the only eyewitness
and needs to be isolated.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.273
Every time he comes to...

03:29.342 --> 03:31.877
(sighs)

03:31.879 --> 03:34.713
I got there just in time
to see my son shoot the guy.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.415
Excuse me. Mr. Dinozzo?

03:36.417 --> 03:38.517
You need to come with me.
Where are we going?

03:38.519 --> 03:40.953
Well, you shouldn't
be talking to anyone.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.723
You the new agent that, uh,
junior told me about?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.692
Yes, ellie bishop.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.995
Are you okay?
A bit shaken.

03:49.997 --> 03:51.630
It's not every day
you see

03:51.632 --> 03:53.498
Someone shot by your own son.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.534
That must have been terrifying.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.571
Junior's description
didn't do you justice.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.907
Oh. (laughs)

04:01.909 --> 04:03.475
Thank you.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.843
All right, mr. Dinozzo...

04:06.713 --> 04:08.981
Tony:
Oh, god.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.916
Coyle's going to head up
the ig investigation?

04:10.918 --> 04:13.285
Sure looks like it.

04:13.287 --> 04:14.620
Any witnesses?

04:14.622 --> 04:15.621
Just one.

04:15.623 --> 04:16.822
My father.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.392
Messy.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.598
I knew junior carried a gun,

04:26.600 --> 04:31.637
But I never realized
that his job was so dangerous.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.307
He could've been killed.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.341
But he wasn't.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.310
The other man died.

04:38.312 --> 04:40.312
I need you to concentrate.

04:40.314 --> 04:41.847
Think back.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.982
Who drew their gun first?

04:45.451 --> 04:47.786
I honestly don't know.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.856
When I got there,

04:50.858 --> 04:52.691
The gun was pointed at me.

04:52.693 --> 04:54.026
Did the victim say anything?

04:54.028 --> 04:55.460
No, I-I don't think so.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.461
And your son

04:56.463 --> 04:58.897
Just shot him?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.334
Yeah.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.070
But...

05:05.072 --> 05:06.838
But what?
Oh...

05:10.043 --> 05:12.444
Oh, junior had
the gun pointed at him.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.680
I thought you said the
gun was pointed at you.

05:15.715 --> 05:17.082
(quiet laugh)

05:17.084 --> 05:18.717
You're trying
to confuse me, huh?

05:18.719 --> 05:22.020
No, I'm not, mr. Dinozzo.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.556
I'm trying to find the truth.

05:24.558 --> 05:28.026
Mcgee:
<i>I talked to the hotel's</i>
<i>I.T. Guy.</i>

05:28.028 --> 05:30.862
Someone accessed their server
from outside the building

05:30.864 --> 05:32.798
And crashed
all their security cameras.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.066
They're still not up.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.534
We should go back
to the hotel and show

05:35.536 --> 05:36.702
The bogus commander's
photo around.

05:36.704 --> 05:41.340
Dinozzo, you are benched
until you're cleared by the ig.

05:41.342 --> 05:42.374
The ig.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.442
Speak of the devil.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.477
You're up, dinozzo.

05:53.519 --> 05:55.454
You look tired.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.489
Ah, it's been
a difficult morning.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.558
Ichabod crane says
I can't leave town.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.693
I hope he doesn't mind
if I go back to the hotel.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.028
Bishop?
Bishop: Hmm?

06:04.497 --> 06:05.497
Come on, mr. Dinozzo.

06:05.499 --> 06:06.498
I'll drive you.

06:06.500 --> 06:09.434
Oh, that'd be nice.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.970
Oh, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hey!

06:11.972 --> 06:13.071
Abigail.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.506
Look at this outfit.

06:14.508 --> 06:16.041
Well, it was Sunday.
I was at church.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.576
How are you?

06:17.578 --> 06:19.411
How about a hug?
It's my specialty.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.480
Oh, I'm feeling
better already.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.748
(both laugh)
gibbs: Abbs?

06:22.750 --> 06:24.449
You here for a reason?

06:24.451 --> 06:25.684
We'll catch up later.
Okay.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.785
Yes. Where's tony?

06:26.787 --> 06:28.420
I can't wait to tell him
what I found.

06:28.422 --> 06:30.155
What?
Well, I ran
the dead guy's prints

06:30.157 --> 06:31.890
Through afis and I got a hit.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.059
And tony's head
is going to explode.
Why?

06:34.061 --> 06:35.927
Well, he's a private
investigator.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.462
Oh. Tony's gonna be doing

06:37.464 --> 06:38.563
Bad bogart impressions
for a week.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.865
Do not tell tony.
Oh, no.

06:39.867 --> 06:40.899
He'll know.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.067
As soon as he hears the name.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.668
It's not just anybody.

06:43.670 --> 06:45.003
It's nick bodeen.

06:45.005 --> 06:47.472
He was the infamous
private investigator

06:47.474 --> 06:48.907
Of all the rich and powerful.

06:51.010 --> 06:54.613
What was he doing
in a navy uniform?

07:04.791 --> 07:06.892
How much longer
is this gonna take?

07:08.127 --> 07:10.128
As long as I think necessary.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.830
What is your problem?

07:11.832 --> 07:13.098
What more do you want?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.800
You were off-duty.

07:14.802 --> 07:18.170
And fired at a man who
didn't fire at you.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.505
This isn't going
to just go away.

07:20.507 --> 07:21.773
It was justified.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.442
Because the guy was an impostor.

07:23.444 --> 07:25.444
And you knew that because
the stripes on his sleeve

07:25.446 --> 07:26.778
Didn't match the scrambled
eggs on his hat?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.114
Yeah. I'm a trained
investigator.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.216
I observe things.

07:31.218 --> 07:33.485
And based on that,
you drew your weapon...

07:33.487 --> 07:34.853
No!

07:34.855 --> 07:36.188
I drew my weapon

07:36.190 --> 07:38.156
Because he drew his first.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.125
Well, then I have a problem.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.494
The only witness

07:42.496 --> 07:44.162
Still alive, your own father,

07:44.164 --> 07:46.498
Wasn't sure that it
happened that way.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.532
Great.

07:47.534 --> 07:49.568
What did he say?

07:50.736 --> 07:53.538
Okay, look.

07:53.540 --> 07:57.209
Dad looks great.

07:57.211 --> 07:59.811
'cause he's got
the dinozzo genes.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.981
But his memory is not
what it used to be.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.916
He's getting older.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.718
Do I need to go over
the restrictions

08:06.720 --> 08:08.520
Of being on
administrative duty?

08:08.522 --> 08:11.089
You're enjoying this a little
too much, aren't you, eugene?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.858
Just doing my job.

08:14.560 --> 08:16.595
You make me feel guilty, jake.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.264
Ask your brother.
Maybe he wants to go.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.500
I have no idea how late I'll be.

08:21.502 --> 08:24.002
I'll... I'll call you
when I know more.

08:24.004 --> 08:25.804
Love you, too.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.874
Standing your husband up?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.008
Yeah.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.510
We have tickets

08:31.512 --> 08:33.011
To the kennedy center tonight.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.013
Bought them
three months ago.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.681
Yeah, I just had
to explain to delilah

08:36.683 --> 08:39.284
Why I can't make her the dinner
I promised her tonight.

08:39.286 --> 08:40.819
Okay. Let me hear it.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.121
Uh, bodeen's a real loser.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.990
Guy had a real rise and fall.

08:44.992 --> 08:45.924
He was a metro cop,

08:45.926 --> 08:47.626
Quickly became a detective,

08:47.628 --> 08:49.060
Then turned private
investigator.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.662
He became first choice
among influential

08:50.664 --> 08:52.631
Lobbyists and lawyers.

08:52.633 --> 08:54.933
Bishop:
But bodeen's methods
were always suspect,

08:54.935 --> 08:56.902
And caught up with him
when he was prosecuted

08:56.904 --> 08:59.070
For wiretapping
in a corporate espionage case.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.006
He escaped conviction
with a hung jury.
There's a rumor,

09:01.008 --> 09:03.041
Never proven, that he
bought one of the jurors.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.043
After that scandal,
he became a pariah.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.079
Lost the big accounts and pretty
much dropped out of sight.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.283
Mcgee, find me a judge
who will issue a warrant

09:11.285 --> 09:13.785
To search bodeen's
residence and office.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.020
Boss, it's Sunday.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.256
On it.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.058
Gibbs:
Hey, how'd it go with coyle?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.059
Tony:
That guy's a total dork.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.028
Anything on the dead guy?

09:23.030 --> 09:25.764
We're working on it.
Where's my dad?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.299
I took him back
to the adams house.

09:27.301 --> 09:28.934
(phone ringing)

09:28.936 --> 09:29.968
Yeah, yeah.

09:29.970 --> 09:30.936
Yeah, I'll be right down.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.104
(hangs up phone)

09:39.845 --> 09:41.746
I've always been fascinated
by private detectives.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.915
Yes, I would venture that's
because you've been influenced

09:43.917 --> 09:46.318
By the great literary
british detectives.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.954
Sherlock holmes, jane marple.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.755
They were all intelligent.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.257
Cultured.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.793
Articulate, refined.

09:54.795 --> 09:58.063
Not shady and unethical.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.864
Like this hustler.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.232
This miscreant.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.767
I like ace ventura.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.970
Who?
The pet detective.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.005
Anyone that helps
animals is at the top

10:07.007 --> 10:09.007
Of my detective list. Hey.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.241
I thought you
said that bodeen

10:10.243 --> 10:12.711
Did not fire his weapon at tony.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.045
Yeah.
Well...

10:14.047 --> 10:15.647
There is a bullet missing

10:15.649 --> 10:16.948
From his gun's magazine.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.984
And we did a gsr test.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.151
Ducky:
Yes, and based
on the amount

10:20.153 --> 10:22.020
Of residue on his right hand,

10:22.022 --> 10:24.956
Bodeen fired his weapon
quite recently.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.124
When?
Abby: Like...

10:26.126 --> 10:27.392
This morning.

10:30.663 --> 10:32.030
What is he up to?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.865
I've been calling
my father's cell.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.266
He's not answering.
It goes straight to voice mail.

10:35.268 --> 10:37.802
Huh. Try the hotel.
Oh, I did.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.037
They said
he's not registered there.

10:39.039 --> 10:41.172
He never was.

10:41.174 --> 10:43.742
Why would he tell me he was
staying at the adams house?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.043
I just dropped him off there.
I mean,

10:45.045 --> 10:46.211
There's got to be
a simple explanation.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.212
You don't know him.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.380
He seems very sweet.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.148
And concerned about you.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.182
Don't be seduced by his charm.

10:51.184 --> 10:52.851
He's self-centered.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.152
He's a one-man
wrecking crew.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.387
He leaves disaster in his wake.

10:55.389 --> 10:57.889
Come on. You're exaggerating.

10:57.891 --> 10:58.923
Mcgee?

10:58.925 --> 11:00.358
He can be difficult.
Hmm.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.160
Mcgee.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.428
Go back
to the adams house.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.730
The victim's weapon
was fired this morning.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.133
He was exiting the hotel
just before he was shot.

11:08.135 --> 11:09.734
You go back there,
and you conduct

11:09.736 --> 11:10.935
A room-to-room search.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.370
Am I allowed to take backup?

11:12.372 --> 11:16.307
Dinozzo,
you're not going anywhere.

11:21.380 --> 11:24.149
Mcgee:
<i>Did you get that list</i>
<i>from housekeeping?</i>

11:24.151 --> 11:26.284
Yeah. There are 11 rooms
with "do not disturb" signs

11:26.286 --> 11:28.987
That the staff
hasn't entered today.
Two on this floor.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.755
What if we check them all out
and don't find anything?

11:30.757 --> 11:33.224
Well, then we have to search
all 424 rooms at this hotel.

11:33.226 --> 11:36.094
Mmm! (sighs)
we'll be here all night.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.863
I'm gonna have one
very unhappy husband.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.765
Well...
Woman:
Wow! You went all out.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.133
Man:
I'm here to please.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.002
That's tony's father.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.871
Mcgee:
Who's he with?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.339
Mr. Dinozzo:
After you.

11:48.341 --> 11:51.042
Thanks.(chuckles)
let's get you comfortable.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.410
I'll...
No, no, no, no.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.978
Woman:
This is so wonderful!

11:55.181 --> 11:58.083
Do we tell tony?

11:58.085 --> 12:00.385
No. Experience has
told me it is best

12:00.387 --> 12:03.354
Not to get involved in
dinozzo family affairs.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.123
Come on.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.896
Preliminary
autopsy report.

12:11.898 --> 12:13.898
Let me guess.
He was shot.

12:13.900 --> 12:16.234
Put it on gibbs' desk.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.136
Red jack on a black queen.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.237
Oh, yeah.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.441
Thank you.
(phone ringing)

12:23.443 --> 12:25.443
Hey, who'd be calling
on a Sunday night?

12:25.445 --> 12:28.046
I'm gonna get it.

12:29.381 --> 12:31.282
Special agent mcgee's desk.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.751
Yes.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.052
Oh, yeah.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.954
Hold on.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.388
I will make sure that he knows.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.023
Woman:
Thank you.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.492
Uh-huh. Thanks.

12:41.360 --> 12:42.393
What was that about?

12:42.395 --> 12:43.895
That was the court clerk.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.830
The judge just signed
the search warrant

12:45.832 --> 12:47.365
For nick bodeen's residence
and offices.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.467
What are you talking about,
nick bodeen?

12:50.870 --> 12:52.370
Tony, don't you know
who you shot?

12:54.206 --> 12:56.875
That was nick bodeen,
the private eye.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.880
(knocking)
mcgee:
<i>Federal agents.</i>

13:01.882 --> 13:05.216
I think we really disturbed
that last couple.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.919
Yeah. Looked like they hadn't
been out of the room in days.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.287
Mmm. Wouldn't want to be
the housekeeper

13:09.289 --> 13:11.156
Who has to clean up that mess.

13:14.927 --> 13:16.995
Mcgee:
Hello?

13:28.174 --> 13:30.141
Mcgee...

13:39.952 --> 13:43.154
Wouldn't want to have
to clean up that mess, either.

13:54.066 --> 13:58.570
Time of death, between 9:30
and 10:00 this morning.

13:58.572 --> 14:00.171
That's consistent with
bodeen's confrontation

14:00.173 --> 14:02.173
With tony out front.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.908
We know that was at 9:50.

14:03.910 --> 14:05.243
Jimmy:
Two separate shootings
on a Sunday.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.611
I think that's a record for us.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.546
Contents of the wallet
say he's michael elliot,

14:08.548 --> 14:11.316
But he checked into the
hotel under an alias.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.286
I'll bag the pillow,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.589
But do I have to collect
all the feathers?

14:20.392 --> 14:22.093
Yeah.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.494
Oh.

14:23.496 --> 14:25.296
(scoffs quietly)

14:25.298 --> 14:26.531
She's a probie.

14:26.533 --> 14:29.300
Besides, tony did
a whole lot worse to me.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.974
Mcgee:
<i>Michael walden elliot</i>

14:35.976 --> 14:37.609
Was born in montpelier, vermont.

14:37.611 --> 14:40.245
He graduated magna cum laude
from brown university

14:40.247 --> 14:42.247
Four years ago,
then got his master's

14:42.249 --> 14:45.283
At the mccourt school
of public policy at georgetown.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.651
He's worked on the staff of

14:46.653 --> 14:49.187
U.S. Senator denise o'hara
ever since.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.023
I like her.
She's smart, well-respected,

14:52.025 --> 14:54.192
A ranking member of the senate
appropriations committee.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.227
But I guess
you already know that.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.363
Though not the part
about how I like her.

14:58.365 --> 14:59.998
Michael elliot was single

15:00.000 --> 15:03.201
The hotel front desk
only issued one card key,

15:03.203 --> 15:04.636
And there was no forced entry.

15:04.638 --> 15:07.238
Therefore, he must have
let bodeen in.
Charades.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.406
Why the navy uniform?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.041
Any connection
between these two?

15:10.043 --> 15:11.042
I've got the warrant.

15:11.044 --> 15:12.110
I'm going to bodeen's office.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.278
Maybe I can find
something there.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.180
Of their cell phone,
e-mails, credit cards;

15:16.182 --> 15:18.216
See if their paths
crossed anywhere.
Where is dinozzo?

15:18.218 --> 15:21.619
He was trying to hook up
with his father.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.501
Gibbs said you have
something for me.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.037
Yes, I do.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.276
(beeping)

15:47.379 --> 15:50.348
I told him that I wanted
to show you myself.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.418
To prove to you that agent
dinozzo's instinct was correct.

15:53.420 --> 15:56.521
What is with you people?
I'm not the enemy.

15:56.523 --> 15:58.056
I'm conducting a mandatory,

15:58.058 --> 16:00.391
Agent-involved-shooting
investigation.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.593
Well, I don't like it
when people mess with my team.

16:04.296 --> 16:05.396
Follow me.

16:09.235 --> 16:13.438
Is the one that killed
michael elliot
in his hotel room.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.139
The bullet on the left,

16:15.141 --> 16:17.041
I test-fired
into my ballistics tank.

16:17.043 --> 16:20.345
It's from bodeen's gun,
the same gun he pointed at tony.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.213
And they match.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.382
Agent dinozzo did not have
that knowledge.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.352
All he was going on was
a mismatched navy uniform.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.053
You just don't get it.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.722
Bodeen is the bad guy,

16:30.724 --> 16:32.323
Not tony.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.293
Leave my lab.
We're done here.

16:36.295 --> 16:38.062
(sighs)

17:02.121 --> 17:03.621
(key rattles in lock)

17:11.397 --> 17:12.797
Hey, mcgee.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.632
Put the piece away,
would you?

17:14.634 --> 17:17.335
Tony, what the hell
are you doing here?

17:17.337 --> 17:18.636
Who even told you about bodeen?

17:18.638 --> 17:20.338
Chillax. Shut the door.

17:20.340 --> 17:23.107
You know, if gibbs finds out
about this, you're screwed.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.109
Well, he'll only find out
if you tell him.

17:25.111 --> 17:26.644
How'd you even get in here?
Picked the lock.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.112
It's no problem, right?

17:28.114 --> 17:29.547
We got a warrant.

17:29.549 --> 17:32.283
(à la bogart):
Come on, kid.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.752
We're talking about nick bodeen.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.421
A regular sam spade.

17:36.423 --> 17:39.090
This guy,
great private dick.

17:39.092 --> 17:42.293
Rubbed elbows with
the rich and powerful

17:42.295 --> 17:44.328
From all around
the world.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.463
Sort of a classic

17:45.465 --> 17:47.498
Warner brothers
set deck, you know,

17:47.500 --> 17:49.500
Noir atmosphere.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.469
Yeah, except
it's all phony.

17:51.471 --> 17:52.403
It's fake,
just like him.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.205
Would you take
that hat off?

17:55.407 --> 17:59.310
When bodeen was on his game,
it was a great life.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.479
Until it all came
crashing down around him.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.548
I wonder how he paid
his rent.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.782
He didn't.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.551
Unpaid bills.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.453
He was three months late.
Huh.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.354
Well, if you're
gonna be here,

18:10.356 --> 18:12.423
Might as well
take some pictures.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.625
Oh, his keys. Excellent.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.360
I was looking for these.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.663
This is the only door
I couldn't open.

18:18.665 --> 18:21.799
Pin and tumbler lock.
Heavy duty...

18:21.801 --> 18:25.770
Pick and bump-proof.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.271
What?

18:28.240 --> 18:29.540
Whoa, check this out.

18:31.844 --> 18:33.845
Wow.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.613
Look at all this
surveillance,

18:35.615 --> 18:37.215
Eavesdropping equipment.

18:39.384 --> 18:42.553
I feel like gene hackman
in   <i>the conversati.</i>

18:46.525 --> 18:48.893
This thing has six
quad-core processors in it.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.195
Yeah.

18:51.197 --> 18:52.663
What does that mean?

18:52.665 --> 18:55.299
If you want to hack
into a hotel's security system,

18:55.301 --> 18:56.567
This would be
what you want.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.569
Oh.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.605
Bishop:
<i>I spoke with senator</i>
<i>o'hara's chief of staff.</i>

19:00.607 --> 19:02.473
He said their office
is in total shock,

19:02.475 --> 19:05.143
But he cleared time
for you to meet with
her this afternoon.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.878
So who's the officer
we're meeting with?

19:06.880 --> 19:09.213
Commander lionel saxon.
He works at the pentagon.

19:09.215 --> 19:10.615
Called in,
said he has information

19:10.617 --> 19:12.617
Regarding michael elliot.
I brought him up here.

19:12.619 --> 19:14.185
That's all right, isn't it?

19:16.588 --> 19:18.923
Commander,
special agent gibbs.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.291
You asked to see me?

19:20.293 --> 19:21.325
Yes, I did.

19:21.327 --> 19:22.493
Please, have a seat.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.561
Thank you.

19:23.563 --> 19:25.396
When I heard about
michael elliot's

19:25.398 --> 19:28.266
Murder, I thought
I should contact you.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.700
How do you know him?
I don't.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.769
I got a call from him
Friday at my office.

19:31.771 --> 19:32.904
He, um, sounded nervous.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.472
Didn't want to talk
on the phone

19:34.474 --> 19:35.573
Or come to the pentagon.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.741
Wouldn't meet in public.

19:36.743 --> 19:38.776
Suggested a room
at the adams house.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.411
Any idea what he wanted
to talk about?

19:40.413 --> 19:42.280
None.
I thought about it.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.848
The only connection
I can think of

19:43.850 --> 19:45.917
Is that I helped prepare
a report for a committee

19:45.919 --> 19:47.752
That his boss,
senator o'hara, chairs.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.621
But I never dealt
with or met elliot.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.356
What was the subject
of the report?

19:52.358 --> 19:53.824
I assessed the strategic
military value

19:53.826 --> 19:56.761
Of several u.S. Navy
ports of call in asia.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.297
Did you go to the hotel
to meet him, commander?

19:59.299 --> 20:02.200
Yeah, but there was a commotion
in front when I arrived.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.734
I had trouble getting in.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.270
I didn't learn until later
that it was your investigation.

20:06.272 --> 20:07.672
What time was that?

20:07.674 --> 20:09.307
I was supposed
to meet him at 10:00,

20:09.309 --> 20:12.910
Uh, when I got to the room,
I knocked, but no one answered.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.845
There was a "do not disturb"
sign on the door.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.647
I waited anyway.

20:16.649 --> 20:18.449
About 15 minutes,
then left.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.819
But I thought
I should tell you.
Appreciate it.

20:21.821 --> 20:25.923
If you think of anything else,
commander, give us a call, huh?

20:25.925 --> 20:28.793
Can I ask you something,
agent gibbs?
Sure.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.661
The man killed
in front of the hotel,

20:30.663 --> 20:31.696
He was a naval officer?

20:31.698 --> 20:33.831
He was impersonating one.

20:33.833 --> 20:35.299
Are the two deaths connected?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.270
Kind of looking that way.

20:40.305 --> 20:42.640
You think he was
impersonating me?

20:50.782 --> 20:52.850
Any luck?

20:53.885 --> 20:56.554
No.

20:56.556 --> 21:00.024
You know, his birthday,
social security number,

21:00.026 --> 21:02.693
Address, phone number.
Nothing's working.

21:02.695 --> 21:05.029
Well, we'll...
I'll get it back to abby.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.031
She'll be able
to get it open.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.934
(door opens, shuts)

21:11.770 --> 21:14.505
Gibbs say he was gonna
join you here?

21:14.507 --> 21:17.041
Woman:
Mr. Bodeen?

21:17.043 --> 21:18.309
I'll handle this.

21:18.311 --> 21:19.477
Wait-- no.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.911
Tony, no.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.547
Shh.

21:29.354 --> 21:30.755
Wow.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.390
(quietly):
Come on.

21:35.594 --> 21:37.628
Can I help you?
I, uh...

21:37.630 --> 21:39.530
I talked to you on
the phone last week.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.565
Ah, yes.

21:44.037 --> 21:48.706
Uh, your voice is...
Remind me, miss...

21:48.708 --> 21:51.075
Oh, allen. Liz allen.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.344
Oh, yeah, right.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.012
And we were
talking about...

21:55.014 --> 21:57.782
I think my husband's having
an affair.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.351
Unbelievable.

22:00.353 --> 22:03.788
Guy would have to be nuts
to cheat on a dame like you.

22:03.790 --> 22:06.057
(cell phone ringing)

22:07.626 --> 22:09.727
Hold up.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.929
That's, um,
one of my operatives.

22:11.931 --> 22:14.632
Excuse me.
Okay.

22:14.634 --> 22:16.667
(sighs)

22:17.803 --> 22:18.836
Who are you?

22:18.838 --> 22:20.805
Federal officer, ncis.

22:20.807 --> 22:22.573
I'd like to ask you
a few questions.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.809
(sighs)
dad, where have you been?

22:24.811 --> 22:26.010
I'll explain, uh...

22:26.012 --> 22:28.045
Meet me in the hotel bar.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.417
(crying)

22:33.419 --> 22:34.752
Afternoon.

22:36.054 --> 22:37.755
Ncis.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.725
Special agents gibbs and bishop.

22:40.727 --> 22:43.394
Uh, yes, the senator
is expecting you.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.563
Let me tell her
you've arrived.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.932
The ncis agents are here.

22:47.934 --> 22:50.000
Yes, ma'am.

22:51.136 --> 22:53.003
She'll be right with you.

22:53.005 --> 22:55.072
Why don't you have a seat?

22:56.842 --> 22:58.976
You all right, jennifer?

22:58.978 --> 23:01.112
Not... Really.

23:01.114 --> 23:03.381
(choking up):
It's been a tough morning.

23:03.383 --> 23:06.150
Um, michael elliot
was a very special person.

23:06.152 --> 23:07.852
You close to him?

23:07.854 --> 23:10.121
We started working here
at about the same time.

23:10.123 --> 23:11.655
Man:
Agents,

23:11.657 --> 23:13.891
Will pritchard,
chief of staff. Come on in.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.494
The senator is due
at a subcommittee meeting,

23:16.496 --> 23:18.496
But insisted
on making time for you.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.631
Senator o'hara:
<i>Why would someone</i>
<i>shoot michael?</i>

23:20.633 --> 23:22.500
It doesn't make any sense.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.001
You notice any changes
in him lately?

23:24.003 --> 23:25.403
Anything bothering him?

23:25.405 --> 23:27.938
To be truthful,
I didn't deal directly

23:27.940 --> 23:30.608
With him that much,
but will did.

23:30.610 --> 23:31.609
Will:
Good kid,

23:31.611 --> 23:33.144
Followed through on everything.

23:33.146 --> 23:35.546
Great with detail.
(cell phone ringing)

23:35.548 --> 23:37.415
Excuse me.
We'll be leaving in a minute.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.682
Thank you.
Don't worry.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.718
Did he work on any sensitive

23:40.720 --> 23:42.953
Or classified issues?

23:42.955 --> 23:45.923
No, uh, mostly he just worked
with constituents from the state

23:45.925 --> 23:48.058
Who had requests
or problems.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.594
We'll need access to his
office computer and files.

23:50.596 --> 23:51.662
Absolutely. Will?

23:51.664 --> 23:53.597
Would you please
call jennifer?

23:53.599 --> 23:54.899
May I ask,

23:54.901 --> 23:57.101
Do you have any suspects?

23:58.170 --> 24:00.037
We do.

24:01.673 --> 24:03.140
Do you know if michael elliot

24:03.142 --> 24:05.543
Had any connection to a man
named nick bodeen?

24:06.545 --> 24:08.479
The private investigator?

24:08.481 --> 24:10.881
Oh, come on.
You're not serious.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.650
I mean, no, there's no way

24:12.652 --> 24:15.619
That an intelligent young man
like michael elliot

24:15.621 --> 24:17.054
Would have anything to do

24:17.056 --> 24:19.990
With such a...
Disreputable character.

24:19.992 --> 24:21.459
Will: I'm sorry, uh,
you'll have to excuse us.

24:21.461 --> 24:23.060
The senator is late

24:23.062 --> 24:24.562
For a committee meeting.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.831
Keep me posted, agent gibbs.

24:26.833 --> 24:28.966
And if you have
any more questions,

24:28.968 --> 24:31.068
Don't hesitate to call.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.203
Oh, jennifer,

24:32.205 --> 24:34.905
Would you please
help these agents?

24:34.907 --> 24:36.740
Make sure that they have
everything they need.

24:36.742 --> 24:38.476
Yes, ma'am.

24:43.248 --> 24:44.849
Junior.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.050
(sighs)

24:53.959 --> 24:55.559
So, where have you been?

24:55.561 --> 24:57.194
Why didn't you
answer your phone?

24:57.196 --> 24:59.029
(sighs)
I've been busy.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.031
Busy?

25:01.033 --> 25:02.233
Where are you staying?

25:02.235 --> 25:03.968
Here, at the hotel.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.503
You're not registered here.

25:05.505 --> 25:08.906
I'm staying with a friend.
Who?

25:08.908 --> 25:11.509
In due time, junior,
in due time.

25:12.744 --> 25:14.245
You need a drink.

25:14.247 --> 25:15.980
No, I don't.

25:15.982 --> 25:17.848
What the hell
is going on with you?

25:17.850 --> 25:20.150
(sighs)
I'm worried about you.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.118
You're worried about me?

25:21.120 --> 25:23.287
I'm worried about you.

25:23.289 --> 25:26.724
You're the one
that shot a man yesterday.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.792
You could've been killed,
junior.

25:28.794 --> 25:31.829
Well, I'm fine. Look, dad,
that is part of my job.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.230
Well, maybe it's time
you thought about

25:33.232 --> 25:35.266
Getting another career.
Don't change the subject.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.768
Now, what are you
doing in washington?

25:37.770 --> 25:39.637
Come clean with me.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.205
What's this great news
that you were gonna

25:41.207 --> 25:43.107
Tell me about
before we were interrupted?

25:43.109 --> 25:45.009
You call shooting a man
an "interruption"?

25:45.011 --> 25:46.777
Dad.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.848
I found my soul mate.

25:51.883 --> 25:54.318
I'm getting married.

26:08.667 --> 26:10.301
This is interesting.

26:10.303 --> 26:11.936
What?

26:11.938 --> 26:13.103
What...

26:13.105 --> 26:14.672
Oh, are you talking to me?

26:14.674 --> 26:16.006
You said something.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.575
I did?

26:18.176 --> 26:20.177
Out loud?

26:20.179 --> 26:21.245
What do you got?

26:21.247 --> 26:22.813
Uh...

26:22.815 --> 26:24.348
Senator o'hara's staff

26:24.350 --> 26:26.116
Has been focused
on a budget cut bill

26:26.118 --> 26:29.920
That would close several
u.S. Ports of call in asia.

26:29.922 --> 26:33.724
Now, commander saxon
told us he was asked

26:33.726 --> 26:35.693
To prepare a report assessing
the military value

26:35.695 --> 26:37.361
Of several asian ports of call

26:37.363 --> 26:39.630
Visited by u.S. Navy ships.
Well, makes sense.

26:39.632 --> 26:42.299
You wouldn't want to close one
of strategic importance.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.701
Think that's what
michael elliot wanted

26:43.703 --> 26:45.603
To talk to the commander about?
It could be.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.304
The bill is
to be voted on this week.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.773
Commander saxon said
elliot sounded desperate.

26:52.978 --> 26:54.778
You find your father?

26:54.780 --> 26:56.113
(chuckling wryly):
Oh, yeah.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.715
Where was he?

26:57.717 --> 27:00.718
(sighs) he's staying
at the adams house hotel.

27:00.720 --> 27:03.821
He's in a room registered
to his fiancée.

27:03.823 --> 27:06.624
He's getting married?
(chuckles)

27:06.626 --> 27:09.226
Yeah, well...

27:09.228 --> 27:11.295
It's not like we haven't...

27:11.297 --> 27:13.297
Been through that
a few times before.

27:13.299 --> 27:15.232
Did you meet
your future stepmom?

27:15.234 --> 27:17.234
No.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.003
Do you know anything about her?

27:19.005 --> 27:20.838
No.
Oh.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.706
Drives me crazy.

27:22.708 --> 27:24.375
He's just...

27:24.377 --> 27:25.909
Who's like that?

27:25.911 --> 27:27.945
Wants me to meet her first.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.981
(muttering):
I don't know.

27:33.718 --> 27:35.686
What's that face?

27:35.688 --> 27:36.920
(phone ringing)

27:36.922 --> 27:38.689
What do you know, bishop?
Uh...

27:38.691 --> 27:40.257
No, uh, why-why would
I know anything?

27:40.259 --> 27:41.392
Mcgee:
Yeah, abbs, I'll
be right down.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.928
Mcgee?

27:44.930 --> 27:46.397
Tim?

27:46.399 --> 27:48.232
Timothy mcgee!

27:48.234 --> 27:51.402
(smacking lips)

28:00.412 --> 28:02.446
Don't be stupid, probie.

28:02.448 --> 28:05.315
I can make your life miserable.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.451
Just ask mcgee.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.154
(sighs)
we saw your father
at the hotel with a woman.

28:10.156 --> 28:11.355
And?

28:11.357 --> 28:14.792
And... She's very beautiful.

28:14.794 --> 28:15.993
And?

28:15.995 --> 28:17.928
Very young.

28:17.930 --> 28:20.130
And, uh...

28:20.132 --> 28:22.800
She's very pregnant.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.702
(groans)

28:24.704 --> 28:27.271
(sighs)

28:35.313 --> 28:37.281
I'm almost in.
You getting anywhere?

28:37.283 --> 28:39.483
No. All of bodeen's
clients' names and records

28:39.485 --> 28:41.719
Are encrypted.

28:41.721 --> 28:43.253
There's also a ton
of audio files,

28:43.255 --> 28:45.022
But they're unreadable.
Well, take a break.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.190
Come here.
I could use your help.

28:46.192 --> 28:47.758
Put these on.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.731
All right.

28:53.733 --> 28:55.933
Now, when you
hear a click,

28:55.935 --> 28:57.901
Pull up on the handle.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.277
(clicks loudly)
all right.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.518
.357 magnum.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.453
It's loaded.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.288
And the serial number's
been filed off.

29:19.290 --> 29:21.825
It's a cheap
prepaid burn phone.

29:26.498 --> 29:29.166
Eureka.

29:30.301 --> 29:32.903
"royal bank of macao."

29:34.005 --> 29:36.540
Holy macao, mcgee.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.275
That's... Curious.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.476
Gibbs:
<i>How much is there?</i>

29:39.478 --> 29:41.478
Mcgee:
Just under $48,000.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.147
Probably was 50.

29:43.149 --> 29:44.848
There were some bills missing
from one of the packs.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.016
Why macao?

29:46.018 --> 29:47.451
Maybe bodeen is a gambler.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.553
That's what the
place is known for.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.288
It surpassed vegas
as the gambling capital

29:51.290 --> 29:52.489
Of the world years ago.

29:52.491 --> 29:55.192
(cell phone ringing)

29:57.796 --> 29:59.897
Hey, you gonna get that?
No.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.865
Well, then turn it off.
It's my father.

30:01.867 --> 30:03.867
He's trying to set up
a dinner for tonight

30:03.869 --> 30:06.537
So that I can meet
my future stepmother.

30:06.539 --> 30:08.338
Get a hold of
state department.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.874
See if he's ever
been to macao.
Okay.

30:10.876 --> 30:12.209
Bodeen's been to macao.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.346
Who told you about bodeen?

30:16.348 --> 30:17.915
Uh, eugene.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.349
(chuckles)

30:19.351 --> 30:21.084
Loose lips on that guy.

30:22.287 --> 30:23.287
How do you know

30:23.289 --> 30:24.922
Bodeen's been to macao?

30:24.924 --> 30:27.291
Hmm?

30:27.293 --> 30:29.393
Oh, how would I know that?

30:29.395 --> 30:31.295
Uh, mcgee?

30:31.297 --> 30:32.930
What?

30:32.932 --> 30:34.331
Remember you took pictures
in his office?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.233
Yeah.

30:36.235 --> 30:39.036
And then you put them
on the plasma.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.471
And then I-I was like,
"hey, look at that."

30:41.473 --> 30:43.440
Remember?
'cause I was like...

30:43.442 --> 30:44.975
Put those pictures
back up there again.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.944
'cause I said to him,
I was like, "those...

30:46.946 --> 30:49.079
Look at, uh, the detail."

30:49.081 --> 30:52.282
Oh, yeah, that one right there.

30:52.284 --> 30:54.318
Make that one bigger.
Make it bigger.

30:56.421 --> 30:59.489
"nick, thanks for
a great job. Calvin ling,

30:59.491 --> 31:01.191
Macao, 2011."

31:01.193 --> 31:03.093
Find out who calvin ling is.

31:05.129 --> 31:07.097
Dinozzo, good job.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.932
Thank you, boss.

31:11.569 --> 31:13.170
Mr. Dinozzo:
Gibbs?

31:13.172 --> 31:15.239
I'm in the basement.

31:21.112 --> 31:23.480
I brought you
a bottle of scotch.

31:29.487 --> 31:31.355
Thanks for seeing me, gibbs.

31:31.357 --> 31:33.423
What's on your mind?

31:33.425 --> 31:36.360
Uh, junior and I
have hit a...

31:36.362 --> 31:39.196
Another rough patch.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.665
(chuckles)
you think?
You've been more

31:41.667 --> 31:44.968
Of a father to him than I
have in the last 12 years.

31:44.970 --> 31:47.137
He respects you,

31:47.139 --> 31:48.939
Values your advice.

31:50.441 --> 31:52.209
Cheers.
(glasses clink)

31:52.211 --> 31:56.113
Were finally at a point
of connecting.

31:56.115 --> 31:57.681
I... (sighs)

31:57.683 --> 32:01.385
I'm in the best place
I've been in for 30 years.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.520
And I want him to be
a part of it, and now,

32:03.522 --> 32:05.389
I can't even get him
on the phone.

32:05.391 --> 32:07.157
So what would you like me
to do about that?

32:08.293 --> 32:10.394
I'd appreciate it very much

32:10.396 --> 32:12.562
If you'd talk to him.

32:14.465 --> 32:15.632
He'll listen to you.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.234
Yeah, well, what do you
want me to say?

32:17.236 --> 32:18.602
That you're
marrying a girl

32:18.604 --> 32:20.404
Young enough
to be your granddaughter?

32:20.406 --> 32:22.072
And you got her pregnant?
How do you expect him

32:22.074 --> 32:23.307
To react to that?

32:23.309 --> 32:24.441
What are you talking about?

32:24.443 --> 32:25.976
You were spotted, chief,
at the hotel

32:25.978 --> 32:27.444
With your pregnant fiancée.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.479
Oh, my god.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.415
Oh, my... No, no, no, no, no.

32:31.417 --> 32:33.183
That-that was taylor,

32:33.185 --> 32:35.552
My fiancée's daughter.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.187
We wanted to announce
our engagement

32:37.189 --> 32:39.022
To our kids at the same time.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.425
That's why we're in washington.
(groans)

32:41.427 --> 32:44.094
Well, you better
straighten it out. Call him.

32:44.096 --> 32:45.529
(dials)

32:45.531 --> 32:48.065
(line ringing)

32:48.067 --> 32:49.499
(indistinct message
plays over phone)

32:49.501 --> 32:51.635
Straight to voice mail.

32:53.738 --> 32:56.440
(sighs)

33:01.079 --> 33:02.746
Oh, we're up.
Morning, boss.

33:02.748 --> 33:05.749
What if I told you that we could
tie bodeen to senator o'hara?

33:05.751 --> 33:08.018
You telling me?
Mcgee:
This is the burn phone

33:08.020 --> 33:09.486
We found in bodeen's safe.

33:09.488 --> 33:10.587
In the last
several weeks,

33:10.589 --> 33:12.556
He made 17 calls

33:12.558 --> 33:14.424
To a cell phone
registered to o'hara.

33:14.426 --> 33:17.394
Hey! Tell me about him.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.063
Uh, calvin ling, 46.

33:20.065 --> 33:22.599
Was born in hong kong
but now resides in macao.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.468
A street hustler who made
his fortune gambling

33:24.470 --> 33:25.535
Before he was 25.

33:25.537 --> 33:26.770
He invested well.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.505
Has substantial holdings
throughout asia,

33:28.507 --> 33:31.108
Including controlling
interest in a casino.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.542
Mcgee:
More pertinent to
our investigation,

33:32.544 --> 33:34.144
Ling owns a service company

33:34.146 --> 33:37.647
That sells fuel and supplies
to u.S. Navy vessels

33:37.649 --> 33:39.249
In several asian ports.

33:39.251 --> 33:40.484
If senator o'hara's
committee

33:40.486 --> 33:41.618
Eliminates those
ports of call,

33:41.620 --> 33:43.286
Ling stands to
lose a fortune.

33:43.288 --> 33:45.122
Find out how strategic
the ports are

33:45.124 --> 33:46.623
That ling
services for us.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.525
Bishop, get a hold
of commander saxon.

33:48.527 --> 33:49.760
Could the money
in bodeen's safe

33:49.762 --> 33:51.294
Have been to buy
influence with o'hara?

33:51.296 --> 33:53.296
Mcgee:
She took a bribe,

33:53.298 --> 33:54.531
Michael elliot
found out about it,

33:54.533 --> 33:56.066
But was killed by bodeen

33:56.068 --> 33:57.567
Before he could
blow the whistle.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.703
Yeah, well, we better be right
if we're gonna accuse

33:59.705 --> 34:02.572
One of the most powerful women
on the hill of bribery.

34:10.782 --> 34:14.284
Woman:
Mr. Elliot, you missed
your massage this morning.

34:14.286 --> 34:16.420
Elliot: I'm sorry. I've... I've
got a lot on my mind right now.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.422
Woman:
That's why you need a massage.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.158
Well, I'm sorry. I am
going to have to charge you.

34:21.160 --> 34:22.325
What am I listening to?

34:22.327 --> 34:23.560
I finally decrypted

34:23.562 --> 34:25.195
Our private eye's
audio files.

34:25.197 --> 34:27.130
Wow, what a sleazeball.

34:27.132 --> 34:29.566
The guy was wiretapping,
like, half of washington.

34:29.568 --> 34:32.135
If he was still alive,
we could put him away
for like 1,000 years.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.204
He was recording
michael elliot's calls

34:34.206 --> 34:35.472
For a couple weeks.

34:35.474 --> 34:37.407
But this is the one
you need to hear.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.577
Elliot:
I work for senator
denise o'hara.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.579
I need to talk to you,
commander saxon.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.081
It's real important.

34:44.083 --> 34:45.382
Saxon:
What did you say your name was?

34:45.384 --> 34:46.783
Elliot: Michael elliot.
Saxon: What's this about?

34:46.785 --> 34:49.219
Elliot: I-I don't want
to talk about it on the phone.

34:49.221 --> 34:52.189
Elliot:
No, no, I'm not going
to the pentagon.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.323
It needs to be
somewhere private.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.292
Elliot sounded totally paranoid.

34:55.294 --> 34:56.793
He had every
right to be.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.229
He's dead.

34:59.231 --> 35:00.864
Saxon:
All right, where do you live?
I'll come to you.

35:00.866 --> 35:02.332
Elliot:
I moved out of my apartment.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.101
I'm staying at the adams house.

35:04.103 --> 35:05.335
Room 502.

35:05.337 --> 35:06.770
Saxon:
I can't do it tomorrow,

35:06.772 --> 35:08.438
But I can meet you
Sunday morning. 10:00?

35:08.440 --> 35:10.774
Elliot:
Okay. What do you look like?

35:10.776 --> 35:12.509
Saxon:
I'll be the guy in
the navy commander's uniform.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.812
That's the reason bodeen
was wearing the uniform.

35:15.814 --> 35:18.281
Got there 15 minutes early
to silence him.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.850
Bishop:
On the left
is a page from

35:19.852 --> 35:21.518
Commander saxon's report

35:21.520 --> 35:24.321
Strategically ranking
the navy ports of call in asia.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.589
These three ports
are serviced

35:25.591 --> 35:27.290
By calvin ling's
company.

35:27.292 --> 35:29.860
On the right is the report
as it appears in the senate bill

35:29.862 --> 35:31.294
To be voted on this afternoon.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.362
Someone altered the report.

35:32.364 --> 35:34.831
Moved ling's ports
up on the list.

35:34.833 --> 35:37.567
The governor called.
I've been issued a reprieve.

35:37.569 --> 35:39.769
Here's my preliminary report.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.905
Evidence indicates agent dinozzo

35:41.907 --> 35:44.441
Acted within agency guidelines.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.176
Thank you, eugene.

35:46.178 --> 35:48.311
He can be put
back in the field...

35:48.313 --> 35:50.881
Once he passes
a psych evaluation.

35:50.883 --> 35:52.382
Not exactly a given.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.151
You talk to your
father last night?

35:54.153 --> 35:56.286
No, I turned off my phone.
He showed up at my apartment.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.455
I pretended not to be there.
Bring me up to speed?

35:58.457 --> 36:00.590
You still can't
work this case.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.526
Go talk to your dad.

36:04.195 --> 36:05.662
Now.

36:10.268 --> 36:13.336
Mcgee... Time to go see
senator o'hara.

36:22.246 --> 36:23.747
Where you been?

36:23.749 --> 36:25.282
Why haven't you
answered your phone?

36:25.284 --> 36:27.250
That's my line.

36:28.319 --> 36:29.586
Sit down.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.254
Dad, why don't
you just tell me

36:31.256 --> 36:32.355
What you have
to tell me.

36:32.357 --> 36:33.657
Let's get it
over with.

36:33.659 --> 36:35.392
We can both move
on with our lives.

36:36.861 --> 36:40.230
I've refrained from telling you
who I'm going to marry

36:40.232 --> 36:43.833
Because I was afraid
of how you'd react.

36:43.835 --> 36:45.335
Maybe, uh,

36:45.337 --> 36:47.971
Because you've known her
all your life.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.739
Gosh, I don't know
how that could be.

36:49.741 --> 36:52.542
From what I understand,
she's younger than me.

36:53.511 --> 36:55.412
You were misinformed.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.547
I'm, um....

36:57.549 --> 37:00.283
Marrying linda turner.

37:09.694 --> 37:11.761
Linda.

37:13.898 --> 37:15.532
She's my godmother.

37:15.534 --> 37:16.933
Yeah.

37:16.935 --> 37:18.501
Your mother's best friend.

37:18.503 --> 37:19.936
Sorority sister,

37:19.938 --> 37:21.371
Maid of honor
at our wedding...

37:21.373 --> 37:22.772
So how did this happen?

37:22.774 --> 37:26.576
Hamilton died last year,
and, uh...

37:26.578 --> 37:30.580
I reached out to console linda,
and, uh...

37:30.582 --> 37:33.750
We rekindled our friendship.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.285
"rekindled your friendship"?

37:35.287 --> 37:36.519
What's that
supposed to mean?

37:36.521 --> 37:37.621
Did you have an
affair with linda

37:37.623 --> 37:38.755
When mom was
still alive?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.924
That's exactly...

37:40.926 --> 37:43.426
What I was afraid you'd think.

37:45.630 --> 37:48.031
No.

37:49.500 --> 37:51.935
No, I didn't, tony.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.508
The vote should
be over by 4:30.

37:58.510 --> 38:00.343
We have a press conference
scheduled for 5:15,

38:00.345 --> 38:01.778
So you'll have a chance
to make the evening news.

38:01.780 --> 38:03.346
Gibbs:
Senator o'hara.
You have a minute?

38:03.348 --> 38:05.382
Uh, no, not really, agent gibbs.

38:05.384 --> 38:07.050
I'm rushing to a vote.
I know.
That's what this is about.

38:07.052 --> 38:09.286
Is there someplace
I can talk to you privately?

38:11.889 --> 38:13.323
Anything that you need to talk

38:13.325 --> 38:14.391
To the senator about
includes me.

38:15.826 --> 38:17.427
We have ballistic
and wiretap evidence

38:17.429 --> 38:18.662
That proves conclusively

38:18.664 --> 38:20.664
That nick bodeen
murdered

38:20.666 --> 38:22.399
Your staff member,
michael elliot.

38:22.401 --> 38:24.334
Mcgee:
We've also traced
several calls bodeen made

38:24.336 --> 38:26.670
To a cell phone
registered to your office.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.438
No, no, no.
That-that can't be right.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.040
Why would any member
of my staff

38:30.042 --> 38:31.341
Be dealing
with bodeen?

38:31.343 --> 38:32.409
Whose phone
did he call?

38:32.411 --> 38:33.743
Just know it's registered

38:33.745 --> 38:34.944
To your office.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.413
Well, almost
everyone on our staff

38:36.415 --> 38:37.614
Carries a second phone,

38:37.616 --> 38:39.616
Provided by the office
for senate business.

38:39.618 --> 38:41.318
Mcgee, dial the number.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.724
(phone ringing)

38:58.836 --> 39:00.804
Jennifer?

39:04.475 --> 39:06.076
A pentagon report,

39:06.078 --> 39:07.510
Prepared by commander saxon,

39:07.512 --> 39:08.812
Was altered.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.482
Did she have access to it?

39:12.484 --> 39:14.551
All my mail...

39:16.587 --> 39:21.458
All my correspondence
goes through jennifer.

39:21.460 --> 39:24.094
Did you know nick bodeen?

39:25.696 --> 39:28.698
I need to talk
to a lawyer.

39:32.703 --> 39:34.537
I have asked to delay the vote

39:34.539 --> 39:36.106
On the port-closure bill

39:36.108 --> 39:39.442
Due to the arrest
of one of my staff members

39:39.444 --> 39:41.778
By ncis and capitol police.

39:41.780 --> 39:44.114
And, under the circumstances,

39:44.116 --> 39:46.149
I am reviewing my membership
on this committee

39:46.151 --> 39:48.385
As well as my future
in the senate.

39:48.387 --> 39:49.152
Mcgee:
Got it. Thanks.

39:49.154 --> 39:51.888
That was capitol police.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.556
They found 25,000

39:53.558 --> 39:56.126
U.S. Dollars in
royal bank of macao straps

39:56.128 --> 39:57.560
At jennifer morrison's
apartment.

39:57.562 --> 39:59.129
Anything else?
Yeah.
Pictures of her

39:59.131 --> 40:00.563
And bodeen in macao,

40:00.565 --> 40:02.999
Plus his fingerprints
and his dna.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.467
Ugh.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.469
So when we met
jennifer,

40:06.471 --> 40:07.871
Those tears weren't
for michael elliot.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.172
They were for her
dead boyfriend.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.175
All the evidence we have
on bodeen to them.

40:12.177 --> 40:13.543
Yeah. Do it.

40:13.545 --> 40:15.011
Come on, probie.
Give me a hand.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.080
Mm-hmm.

40:27.525 --> 40:29.159
You meet with
your father's fiancée?

40:30.194 --> 40:32.962
Linda. No.

40:35.466 --> 40:38.501
Look, if he was marrying
anyone else, I wouldn't care.

40:38.503 --> 40:40.203
I just feel like
I'm betraying

40:40.205 --> 40:42.906
My mother.

40:42.908 --> 40:44.674
Linda was her best friend.

40:44.676 --> 40:47.477
Well, maybe he feels
the same way, dinozzo.

40:49.847 --> 40:52.749
That's why he wants
your approval.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.459
Oh, my god. Wow.

41:02.461 --> 41:03.460
Tony dinozzo.

41:03.462 --> 41:04.994
(laughs)
hi!

41:04.996 --> 41:07.230
Oh, my gosh, with
all this craziness,

41:07.232 --> 41:09.833
I didn't think I was
gonna get to see you.
Taylor...

41:09.835 --> 41:13.636
Wow, last time I saw you,
you had a face full of braces

41:13.638 --> 41:14.871
And you were playing

41:14.873 --> 41:16.506
With, like,
a cabbage patch kid.

41:16.508 --> 41:17.874
Yep.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.809
And now I am having
one of my own.

41:19.811 --> 41:21.945
Yes.
(laughs)

41:21.947 --> 41:23.813
So what do you think
about our parents?
I think...

41:23.815 --> 41:25.682
It's weird.

41:25.684 --> 41:26.950
Exactly what I thought...

41:26.952 --> 41:28.718
Until I saw them together.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.487
It's real.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.622
And sweet.
They're in love.

41:32.624 --> 41:35.892
Yeah. Does your mom
know what she's in for?
Oh, yeah.

41:35.894 --> 41:37.126
She does.
Mr. Dinozzo:
Junior!

41:38.262 --> 41:39.896
Thank god you're here.

41:39.898 --> 41:41.564
I was afraid you
weren't gonna show.

41:41.566 --> 41:42.932
She looks great,
doesn't she?

41:42.934 --> 41:44.934
Well...
Taylor:
Aw. Thank you.

41:44.936 --> 41:46.569
Where's my mother?

41:46.571 --> 41:47.604
Still packing.

41:47.606 --> 41:49.272
Mm-hmm, that's what I thought.

41:49.274 --> 41:50.740
I know how to move her along.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.275
I've had years of practice.

41:52.277 --> 41:54.077
It's good to see you.

41:54.079 --> 41:55.645
You'll have to teach
him that trick.

41:55.647 --> 41:56.679
(laughs)

41:56.681 --> 41:58.047
Wow.

41:58.049 --> 41:59.616
You're a piece of work.

41:59.618 --> 42:02.552
Listen, I want
to apologize

42:02.554 --> 42:04.521
For acting like a jerk,

42:04.523 --> 42:05.822
Because linda's
a wonderful woman

42:05.824 --> 42:08.958
And you two deserve to be happy.

42:10.661 --> 42:12.295
You're all right
with this, then, huh?

42:13.797 --> 42:15.131
Of course I am.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.301
And more importantly...

42:20.838 --> 42:23.540
...I know mom would approve.

42:23.542 --> 42:26.042
That's what I needed to hear.

42:28.812 --> 42:30.580
So here's what I'm thinking:

42:30.582 --> 42:32.015
You jump on a later plane,

42:32.017 --> 42:34.217
And we all go out

42:34.219 --> 42:36.019
And have a little family dinner.

42:42.293 --> 42:44.561
I love you, tony.

42:45.863 --> 42:46.896
I love you.
