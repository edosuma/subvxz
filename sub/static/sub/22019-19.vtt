WEBVTT

00:15.620 --> 00:17.053
BASE, THIS IS
DISTRICT CREW ECHO.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.227
SECURITY INSPECTION IS
COMPLETE AT THE POLK COMPLEX.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.534
ALL GOOD. WE ARE ON
OUR WAY OVER TO...

00:22.580 --> 00:24.628
CORDON PLAZA. OVER.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.888
UHH!

00:26.930 --> 00:28.545
DO EXACTLY AS I SAY.

00:28.590 --> 00:30.103
NATE, GET THE HELL OUT!

00:30.160 --> 00:33.243
YOU DO NOT WANT
TO BE A HERO!
NATE: TERRELL!

00:33.290 --> 00:34.939
NO.

00:46.170 --> 00:50.869
BADGES, KEYS,
CLOTH ES--NOW!

00:50.920 --> 00:52.399
YOU WANT US TO STRIP?

00:52.440 --> 00:53.691
DID I STUTI'ER?

01:07.110 --> 01:09.055
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM.

01:23.640 --> 01:25.164
HEY, KRISTY?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.461
UH-HUH.

01:26.520 --> 01:27.680
UH, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I PUT MY--

01:27.730 --> 01:29.379
LEFI' YOUR PHONE?

01:30.780 --> 01:32.566
WHAT WOULD I DO
WITHOUT YOU?

01:32.610 --> 01:34.953
YOU KNOW,
THE AUGHTS JUST CALLED.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.524
THEY WANT THEIR PHONE BACK.

01:36.570 --> 01:38.003
THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

01:38.050 --> 01:39.608
SERIOUSLY,
DOES THE BUREAU EVEN KNOW

01:39.660 --> 01:41.355
YOU'RE STILL USING
THE THING?

01:42.710 --> 01:44.962
WE CAN'T KEEP HAVING
THIS LITTLE CONVERSATION.

01:45.010 --> 01:46.739
PLEASE, IF NOT FOR YOURSELF,

01:46.800 --> 01:48.529
THEN DO IT
FOR THE CHILDREN.

01:48.580 --> 01:50.138
FOR THE CHILDREN?

01:50.190 --> 01:51.236
YES. IF THEIR PARENTS
WERE SHARING

01:51.280 --> 01:52.622
THE SAME PHONE TECHNOLOGY,

01:52.670 --> 01:54.718
THEN THEY COULD SYNCHRONIZE
THEIR CALENDARS.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.546
WELL, THAT'S A VERY
PERSUASIVE ARGUMENT,
COUNSELOR,

01:56.590 --> 01:58.410
BUT IF YOU DON'T
KNOW ME BY NOW...

01:58.460 --> 02:00.633
I KNOW. YOU'RE
A CREATURE OF HABIT,

02:00.680 --> 02:03.808
BUT HABITS WERE MEANT
TO BE BROKEN.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.507
YOU ALREADY BOUGHT IT,
DIDN'T YOU?

02:07.560 --> 02:08.504
MM-HMM.

02:11.780 --> 02:13.475
IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T
DEEPLY APPRECIATE
YOUR THOUGHTFULNESS,

02:13.520 --> 02:14.953
IT'S JUST THAT I GOTI'A GO.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.160
BABE, JUST TAKE
IT WITH YOU.

02:16.220 --> 02:17.562
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.521
NOW GIVE US A KISS AND...

02:19.570 --> 02:21.561
MMM.

02:21.610 --> 02:22.781
I KNOW YOU THINK
THIS IS ABOUT

02:22.830 --> 02:24.878
MY FEAR OF CHANGE,
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY

02:24.920 --> 02:27.616
ABOUT MY COMMITMENT
TO THE THINGS
THAT I TRUST.

02:27.660 --> 02:29.264
UH-HUH. OK.

02:29.320 --> 02:30.617
YOU'RE THE PROFILER,
SWEETH EART,

02:30.670 --> 02:33.537
BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT
A BETTER PHONE.

02:43.770 --> 02:44.850
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:44.900 --> 02:46.800
LOOKS GOOD.

02:46.860 --> 02:49.636
WHAT TIME IS IT?

02:49.690 --> 02:51.464
SHOWTIME.

02:54.170 --> 02:56.206
GUARD: SECURITY
BADGES, PLEASE.

02:57.430 --> 02:58.510
ALL RIGHT.

02:58.560 --> 03:00.300
AND YOU, SIR.

03:12.970 --> 03:15.052
WOMAN:
I'M SO SORRY, MR. COLE,

03:15.100 --> 03:16.920
BUT WE DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE AN APPOINTMENT

03:16.970 --> 03:19.018
SCHEDULED FOR YOU
THIS MORNING.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.106
THAT CAN'T BE.

03:20.150 --> 03:21.708
I CALLED LAST WEEK.

03:21.760 --> 03:24.149
DO YOU RECALL
TO WHOM YOU SPOKE?

03:24.200 --> 03:25.497
IT WAS A WOMAN,

03:25.550 --> 03:26.972
A YOUNGER WOMAN.

03:27.030 --> 03:29.248
EVERYONE AROUND HERE
IS YOUNGER THAN I AM,

03:29.290 --> 03:31.599
SO...NO MA'I'I'ER.

03:31.640 --> 03:33.153
WHY DON'T WE MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

03:33.210 --> 03:35.678
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.
WOULD THAT WORK?

03:35.730 --> 03:37.118
CAN I SEE SOMEONE TODAY?

03:37.170 --> 03:39.126
I NEED TO SPEAK TO ONE
OF YOUR LAWYERS TODAY.

03:39.170 --> 03:41.035
WOMAN: OF COURSE.
MAY I HELP YOU?

03:41.090 --> 03:43.217
VEXT EL, MA'AM.
MAINTENANCE CHECK.

03:43.260 --> 03:44.773
MM-HMM.

03:44.830 --> 03:46.218
WELL, LET'S SEE

03:46.260 --> 03:48.649
WHAT WE CAN DO
FOR YOU.

03:56.840 --> 03:59.149
BOOYAH.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.595
EVERYBODY, GET ON THE GROUND!

04:58.640 --> 04:59.948
RIGHT NOW!

05:06.610 --> 05:07.861
GET UP.

05:07.910 --> 05:09.081
WHAT?

05:09.130 --> 05:10.028
GET UP!

05:10.090 --> 05:12.433
WOMAN: OH, MY GOD!

05:12.480 --> 05:15.779
OH, MY GOD!

05:27.020 --> 05:29.011
YES, SIR?

05:29.060 --> 05:32.018
HAS HRT DEPLOYED?

05:32.070 --> 05:34.197
I'LL BRIEF MY TEAM
IMMEDIATELY.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.629
DAVE, MA'I'I', WE'RE GONNA NEED
ALL HANDS ON DECK.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.977
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE DIRECTOR.

05:38.030 --> 05:39.850
HE WANTS THE BAU
TO TAKE CHARGE

05:39.900 --> 05:42.243
OF A HOSTAGE SITUATION
IN PROGRESS DOWNTOWN.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.632
WHERE DOWNTOWN?

05:43.690 --> 05:45.032
CORDON PLAZA, FOURTH FLOOR.

05:45.080 --> 05:48.038
THE OFFICES OF THE AMERICAN
LEGAL DEFENSE COUNCIL.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.207
ALDC?

05:50.260 --> 05:51.386
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:51.430 --> 05:53.739
HOSTAGE RESCUE TEAM
IS ON ITS WAY, SO--

05:53.780 --> 05:55.998
KRISTY.

05:56.050 --> 05:58.564
WHAT ABOUT KRISTY?

05:58.610 --> 06:01.261
SHE JUST STARTED
WORKING FOR THE ALDC

06:01.310 --> 06:03.392
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.625
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

06:17.680 --> 06:19.978
LISTEN UP!

06:20.030 --> 06:24.330
I REALIZE YOU'RE
CONFUSED, YOU'RE SCARED.

06:24.380 --> 06:28.339
YOU'RE WONDERING "WHAT
THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?"

06:28.380 --> 06:29.984
RIGHT?

06:30.040 --> 06:33.168
WELL, A LOT IS GOING ON HERE.

06:33.210 --> 06:36.828
BECAUSE TODAY
IS A SPECIAL DAY.

06:36.870 --> 06:39.862
TODAY IS THE DAY
THAT ALL OF YOU

06:39.920 --> 06:43.219
GET TO BECOME
A PART OF HISTORY!

07:21.350 --> 07:24.695
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.961
PRENTISS:
"VIOLENCE IS NOT A CATALYST

07:36.020 --> 07:37.146
BUT A DIVERSION."

07:37.190 --> 07:38.794
JOSEPH CONRAD.

07:50.810 --> 07:52.766
SIMMONS: I NEED TO GET
DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW.

07:52.820 --> 07:54.117
I CAN HANDLE HRT'S RESPONSE.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.900
MA'IT, PLEASE.

07:55.950 --> 07:57.986
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T
GO DOWN THERE.

07:58.040 --> 08:00.383
SCREW THE DAMN PROTOCOL, DAVE.

08:00.430 --> 08:02.216
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MY WIFE HERE.

08:02.260 --> 08:04.216
I KNOW.
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE

08:04.260 --> 08:05.864
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH
RIGHT NOW.

08:11.440 --> 08:15.706
KRISTY AND I ACTUALLY
HAD A PLAN FOR THE KIDS

08:15.750 --> 08:18.355
IN CASE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENED,

08:18.410 --> 08:21.789
ONLY WE THOUGHT THE ROLES
WOULD BE REVERSED.

08:21.840 --> 08:26.197
JUST...PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
BE A BYSTANDER TO ALL THIS.

08:26.240 --> 08:27.628
OK, YOU CAN STAY HERE
WITH US,

08:27.680 --> 08:29.932
HELP BUILD THE PROFILE.

08:31.160 --> 08:32.809
THANK YOU.

08:33.810 --> 08:35.983
ALVEZ WILL
TAKE POINT WITH HRT

08:36.030 --> 08:37.634
AND RUN THE TACTICAL OP
ON THE SCENE.

08:37.690 --> 08:40.557
JJ AND TARA WILL COORDINATE
HOSTAGE NEGOTIATIONS.

08:40.600 --> 08:41.942
COLE:
BEFORE THE REST
OF OUR SHOW BEGINS,

08:41.990 --> 08:43.207
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO HAND OVER

08:43.260 --> 08:45.558
ALL PERSONAL
COMMUNICATION DEVICES--

08:45.610 --> 08:49.432
THIS INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO YOUR CELL PHONES,

08:49.480 --> 08:53.564
WATCHES, AND LAPTOPS.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.703
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT
FROM US?

08:56.750 --> 08:58.786
YOUR PHONES.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.554
I DON'T HAVE MY PHONE HERE.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.561
HUH. WHERE IS IT?

09:31.610 --> 09:33.510
I LEFI' IT AT HOME.
I SWEAR.

09:33.570 --> 09:34.958
YOU LEFI' IT AT HOME?

09:35.000 --> 09:36.524
I GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND

09:36.570 --> 09:37.912
AND I JUST HAD TO LEAVE
THE APARTMENT.

09:37.960 --> 09:40.269
BUT THEN WHEN I GOT HERE,
I REALIZED I DIDN'T HAVE IT.

09:40.310 --> 09:41.356
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

09:41.400 --> 09:43.618
STEVEN. STEVEN ONISHI.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.877
OH. AND, UH...

09:45.930 --> 09:47.704
WHAT IS IT

09:47.760 --> 09:50.149
WHAT IS IT THAT YOU
DO HERE, STEVEN?

09:50.190 --> 09:51.885
I'M A PARALEGAL.

09:51.930 --> 09:54.751
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOU.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.769
SINGER: YO,
MOVES LIKE A BOSS

09:59.810 --> 10:01.198
YO, MAN

10:01.250 --> 10:03.684
I SAY MOVES LIKE A BOSS,
YO, MAN

10:03.730 --> 10:04.765
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

10:04.820 --> 10:06.776
MOVES LIKE A BOSS,
YO, MAN

10:06.820 --> 10:09.380
I SAY MOVES
LIKE A BOSS, YO, MAN

10:09.430 --> 10:11.819
I SAY MOVES LIKE A BOSS--

10:11.870 --> 10:13.519
LOOK, THAT WAS STUPID--

10:13.560 --> 10:15.255
YOU MUST THINK I'M STUPID!

10:15.310 --> 10:16.732
HUH

10:16.790 --> 10:17.916
YOU THINK I'M AN IDIOT

10:17.960 --> 10:18.915
PLEASE!

10:18.960 --> 10:21.087
HUH
STEVEN: STOP!

10:21.140 --> 10:22.653
THINK I'M AN IDIOT?

10:22.700 --> 10:23.871
STEVEN:
STOP, PLEASE!

10:23.920 --> 10:25.911
HEY, LET GO OF ME!
LET GO OF--

10:40.030 --> 10:42.669
OH, MY GOD, STEVEN,
ARE YOU OK?

10:43.810 --> 10:45.675
COMMANDER NASH?

10:45.730 --> 10:47.766
I'M SSA JAREAU.
THIS IS SSA LEWIS AND ALVEZ.

10:47.820 --> 10:49.594
I CAN TELL YOU
WHAT I KNOW SO FAR.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.722
ABOUT A HALF-HOUR AGO,
WE RECEIVED MULTIPLE REPORTS

10:51.780 --> 10:53.509
OF SHOTS FIRED
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

10:53.560 --> 10:54.902
AND THE ELEVATORS
WENT DOWN,

10:54.950 --> 10:56.952
BUILDING SECURITY RESPONDED,
THEY WENT UP THE STAIRS,

10:57.000 --> 10:58.160
AND THAT'S WHEN
THEY FOUND THESE--

10:58.220 --> 11:00.563
BRICKS OF C-4
WIRED TO ALL THE DOORS

11:00.610 --> 11:01.781
INTO THE ALDC OFFICES.

11:01.830 --> 11:03.695
BOMB TECHS ARE
WORKING ON THEM NOW.

11:03.750 --> 11:04.739
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ENOUGH
TO BRING THE BUILDING DOWN

11:04.790 --> 11:05.950
ON OUR HEADS--

11:06.010 --> 11:07.045
BUT IT'S ENOUGH TO KILL

11:07.100 --> 11:08.704
EVERYBODY
UP IN THOSE OFFICES.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.138
DO WE KNOW HOW MANY
PEOPLE THAT IS?

11:10.190 --> 11:12.966
OUR BATCH COUNT CONFIRMS
26 ALDC LAWYERS AND STAFFERS.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.271
HOW MANY HOSTAGE

11:14.320 --> 11:15.491
YOUR GUESS
IS AS GOOD AS MINE.

11:15.540 --> 11:16.882
WE HAVE NO EYES
ON THE FOURTH FLOOR.

11:16.930 --> 11:19.239
WELL, WHAT ABOUT
FIBER

11:19.280 --> 11:21.191
WE TRIED. BUT THEY
BLEW OUT THE LENS

11:21.240 --> 11:22.628
WITH THE INFRARED LIGHTS,

11:22.680 --> 11:23.806
AND NOW WE'RE BRINGING IN
THERMAL IMAGING.

11:25.070 --> 11:26.765
MY GUESS IS AT LEAST
2 UNSUBS, MAYBE 3.

11:26.810 --> 11:29.028
SO FAR, WHOEVER'S UP THERE
HAS MADE ZERO EFFORT

11:29.070 --> 11:30.981
TO ESTABLISH ANY LINE
OF COMMUNICATION WITH US.

11:31.030 --> 11:32.895
OH, NO, THEY'RE
COMMUNICATING WITH US.

11:32.950 --> 11:34.941
BY HACKING INTO
ALL OF THIS BUILDING'S

11:34.990 --> 11:36.639
OPERATING SYSTEMS, THEY'RE
TRYING TO LET US KNOW

11:36.690 --> 11:37.941
THAT THEY THINK
THEY'RE IN CHARGE.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.513
WELL, LET'S SEE
WHAT GARCIA CAN DO.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.309
WHAT'S UP WITH YOU?

11:47.350 --> 11:48.430
YOU CAN'T SCREW AROUND
LIKE THAT.

11:48.490 --> 11:49.969
DON'T YOU START
QUESTIONING ME.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.090
I'M THE ONE
IN CHARGE HERE.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.448
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
REMIND YOU OF THAT.

11:52.490 --> 11:53.832
AND I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO REMIND YOU

11:53.880 --> 11:56.747
THAT COPS AND FBI
HAVE PROTOCOL THEY
HAVE TO FOLLOW.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.927
THEY'RE WAITING
TO NEGOTIATE.

11:58.970 --> 12:00.369
SO THEY'RE NOT GONNA
COME BLASTING IN HERE

12:00.410 --> 12:01.536
UNLESS A HOSTAGE IS KILLED.

12:01.590 --> 12:02.750
I KNOW THAT.

12:02.800 --> 12:03.937
THAT'S NOT
WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE

12:03.980 --> 12:05.584
WHEN YOU WERE BASHING
THAT GUY'S HEAD IN.

12:05.630 --> 12:07.586
THE ONLY WAY
WE PULL THIS OFF

12:07.630 --> 12:09.245
IS BY STICKING
TO THE PLAN.

12:09.290 --> 12:10.587
ONCE WE'RE READY FOR THEM,

12:10.640 --> 12:11.629
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER
THE HELL YOU WANT

12:11.680 --> 12:12.760
TO ANYBODY YOU WANT.

12:12.810 --> 12:15.813
WHEN WILL WE BE READY
FOR THEM?

12:15.860 --> 12:19.682
JASPER SAYS WE'RE
RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.778
GARCIA: TRY AS I MIGHT,
I HAVEN'T WRESTLED

12:21.820 --> 12:23.037
THE BUILDING'S
OPERATING SYSTEM

12:23.090 --> 12:24.296
FROM THESE RAT FINKS,

12:24.350 --> 12:26.215
BUT THEY GOT ACCESS
TO THE SERVER

12:26.260 --> 12:28.569
BY USING A KEYCHAIN
CREATED BY THE VEXT EL

12:28.610 --> 12:29.861
INTEGRATED SECURITY SYSTEMS.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.785
YEAH, WE JUST FOUND
ONE OF THEIR WORK VANS

12:31.830 --> 12:33.001
HERE IN THE PARKING GARAGE.

12:33.050 --> 12:34.870
VEXT EL IS THE COMPANY
RESPONSIBLE

12:34.920 --> 12:36.706
FOR THE WHOLE SECURITY
SHEBANG AT CORDON PLAZA.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.799
THEY HAD A MAINTENANCE CHECK
SCHEDULED TODAY

12:39.840 --> 12:41.444
FOR THE ALDC.

12:41.490 --> 12:43.367
DO WE KNOW THE NAMES
OF THE EMPLOYEES

12:43.410 --> 12:44.536
ASSIGNED TO DO THE CHECK?

12:44.580 --> 12:47.060
TERRELL CAMPBELL
AND NATHAN BUTLER.

12:47.110 --> 12:48.805
I'LL FOLLOW UP
WITH THE COMPANY,

12:48.850 --> 12:50.545
BUT THEIR WORK RECORDS
BOTH LOOK REALLY CLEAN.

12:50.590 --> 12:52.808
SEE IF YOU CAN TRACK THE LAST
48 HOURS OF THEIR LIVES.

12:52.850 --> 12:53.760
IF THEY'RE NOT
DIRECTLY INVOLVED,

12:53.810 --> 12:55.368
THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TARGETED.

12:55.420 --> 12:56.808
YOU GOT IT.

12:59.380 --> 13:01.769
THESE GUYS ARE RUNNING
THEIR OWN PLAYBOOK.

13:01.820 --> 13:02.946
THEY'VE MADE
NO PROVOCATIVE ACTION

13:02.990 --> 13:04.252
SINCE SEIZING THE HOSTAGES,

13:04.300 --> 13:05.551
AND WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO OPEN

13:05.610 --> 13:06.770
A LINE OF COMMUNICATION
WITH THEM,

13:06.820 --> 13:08.082
BUT FOR THE LAST 20 MINUTES

13:08.130 --> 13:09.165
THEY JUST PICK UP THE PHONE
AND THEN HANG IT UP.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.380
AND THEY PROBABLY THINK
WE'RE GONNA BE

13:10.440 --> 13:11.737
THROWN OFF
BY THE UNCERTAINTY.

13:11.790 --> 13:13.087
IT'S A CRUDE
PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE,

13:13.140 --> 13:14.823
WHICH MAKES ME THINK WE'RE
DEALING WITH YOUNG MEN.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.393
HOW LONG DOES COMMANDER NASH
THINK IT'LL TAKE

13:16.440 --> 13:17.611
TO DISARM THE IEDs?

13:17.660 --> 13:19.651
ALVEZ: NOT SURE.
THE C-4 CHARGES

13:19.710 --> 13:21.792
ARE NOT ONLY HARD-WIRED
TO ALL THE DOORS,

13:21.840 --> 13:24.570
BUT THERE MIGHT ALSO
BE A REMOTE DETONATOR.

13:24.620 --> 13:25.837
HAVE YOU GUYS
BEEN ABLE TO GET

13:25.890 --> 13:27.232
ANY THERMAL IMAGING
OF THE OFFICES YET?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.009
COMMANDER NASH SAYS
IT'S ON ITS WAY.

13:29.060 --> 13:32.712
SO YOU CAN'T SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON
UP THERE, CAN YOU?

13:32.760 --> 13:36.105
NO, MATI', WE CAN'T.
NOT YET.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.980
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO BE HERE, BUT--

13:38.030 --> 13:40.419
I NEED TO BE HERE.

13:40.470 --> 13:42.335
I'M OK.

14:16.810 --> 14:19.893
I'VE ONLY SEEN
3 OF THEM.

14:19.940 --> 14:21.760
YOU SAY THAT LIKE
YOU HAVE A PLAN.

14:21.810 --> 14:24.813
YEAH, I DO.
THE POLICE AND FBI,

14:24.860 --> 14:25.895
I'M SURE THEY'RE ALREADY
DOWNSTAIRS.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.110
BUT THE PROBLEM IS
THEY HAVE NO WAY

14:27.170 --> 14:28.159
OF ACTUALLY SEEING

14:28.210 --> 14:29.643
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

14:29.690 --> 14:30.941
SO YOU AND I HAVE TO CREATE
A LITTLE DISTRACT ION,

14:31.000 --> 14:31.819
AND THEN I--

14:31.870 --> 14:33.861
OK.

14:33.910 --> 14:36.822
HERE'S WHEN THE FUN BEGINS.

14:36.870 --> 14:38.565
GET UP.

14:38.610 --> 14:40.396
OH!UP!

14:40.440 --> 14:42.431
LET'S GO TO YOUR OFFICE.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.226
TO YOUR OFFICE.

15:04.160 --> 15:07.288
JUST LET THE OTHERS GO.

15:07.340 --> 15:08.637
I WILL STAY WITH YOU.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.941
NO. NO, NO, NO.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.946
NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.958
BUT I DO NEED YOUR HELP.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.126
I NEED YOU TO CHOOSE
A REPRESENTATIVE

15:20.180 --> 15:22.080
FROM YOUR GROUP
TO SPEAK ON MY BEHALF

15:22.130 --> 15:24.735
TO HELP ME NEGOTIATE
WITH THE COPS.

15:24.790 --> 15:25.870
YOU CAN'T SPEAK
FOR YOURSELF?

15:25.920 --> 15:28.172
DESPITE THE PROPAGANDA
YOU PUT OUT,

15:28.230 --> 15:30.960
POLICE ACTUALLY HAVE
AN ITCHY TRIGGER FINGER

15:31.010 --> 15:33.478
FOR FOLKS LIKE ME.

15:38.800 --> 15:39.755
NO.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.062
I WON'T DO IT.

15:41.110 --> 15:44.102
I WON'T LET MYSELF
BE INTIMIDATED

15:44.160 --> 15:47.630
BY MEN LIKE YOU.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.159
NOW, WHO'S THE ONE OF US

15:49.200 --> 15:51.760
THAT'S REALLY
PREJUDICED HERE?

15:57.040 --> 15:59.554
OHH!

16:11.230 --> 16:13.698
THE ELEVATOR--
IT'S ON THE MOVE.

16:16.270 --> 16:18.181
PRENTISS: TARA, TALK TO ME.

16:18.230 --> 16:19.879
IT'S COMING DOWN
FROM THE FOURTH FLOOR.

16:43.780 --> 16:46.032
THIS IS SSA TARA LEWIS.

16:46.090 --> 16:47.955
TO WHOM AM I SPEAKING?

16:48.000 --> 16:50.264
I'D SAY YOU'RE SPEAKING
TO YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE,

16:50.310 --> 16:51.868
SSA TARA LEWIS.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.956
YOU CAN'T INTIMIDATE
A FEDERAL AGENT,

16:54.010 --> 16:55.261
SO LET'S JUST STOP
WITH THE GAMES.

16:55.310 --> 17:00.088
NO GAMES. I DO LIKE
YOUR STYLE, SSA TARA LEWIS.

17:00.140 --> 17:05.146
SO HERE IS MY ONE
AND ONLY DEMAND.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.886
RELEASE LEONARD HAGLAND
FROM PRISON,

17:07.930 --> 17:10.751
OR I START EXECUTING
A HOSTAGE

17:10.810 --> 17:16.635
EVERY 15 MINUTES,
STARTING...

17:16.680 --> 17:18.944
NOW.

17:25.040 --> 17:26.029
LEONARD RUDOLPH HAGLAND,

17:26.080 --> 17:27.809
75 YEARS OLD,
FORMER LEADER

17:27.870 --> 17:29.644
OF A SEPARATIST GROUP
CALLED THE HORSEMEN.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.770
DIDN'T THE ALDC
IDENTIFY THE HORSEMEN

17:31.830 --> 17:32.865
AS A HATE GROUP?

17:32.920 --> 17:34.080
THEY DID, 5 YEARS AGO,

17:34.140 --> 17:35.823
AND SINCE THEN,
THE ALDC LAWYERS,

17:35.880 --> 17:37.825
LIKE KRISTY,
HAVE BEEN WAGING

17:37.880 --> 17:39.916
A NONSTOP LEGAL BATI'LE
AGAINST THE HORSEMEN.

17:39.970 --> 17:42.131
GARCIA:
ONE NIGHT, IN APRIL 2015,

17:42.190 --> 17:44.055
HAGLAND SHOT AND KILLED
TWO VIRGINIA STATE TROOPERS

17:44.100 --> 17:46.921
DURING A RAID OF HIS HOUSE.

17:46.970 --> 17:49.791
HAGLAND NOW SITS
ON DEATH ROW IN VIRGINIA.

17:49.850 --> 17:51.659
HE'S EXHAUSTED
ALL OF HIS APPEALS.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.109
HE'S SCHEDULED TO DIE
BY LETHAL INJECTION
MONDAY MORNING.

17:54.160 --> 17:57.766
SOUNDS LIKE HAGLAND'S
LAST DESPERATE EFFORT
TO STAY ALIVE.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.244
USING SOME GOOD
SOLDIERS RECRUITED
FROM THE HORSEMEN.

18:00.290 --> 18:02.417
I SAY WE BRING
LEONARD HAGLAND IN HERE.

18:02.470 --> 18:06.076
IF HE IS INDEED
THE BRAINS BEHIND
THIS OPERATION,

18:06.120 --> 18:08.122
I BET HE'LL BE
SUCH AN ARROGANT
SON OF A BITCH,

18:08.170 --> 18:09.467
WE WON'T BE ABLE
TO STOP HIM

18:09.520 --> 18:10.817
FROM BRAGGING ABOUT
HIS MASTER PLAN.

18:10.870 --> 18:13.566
PRENTISS:
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.
I'LL MAKE THE CALL.

18:13.610 --> 18:16.829
ALVEZ: IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO DECIPHER THESE
TEMPERATURE DIFFERENTIALS.

18:16.870 --> 18:18.918
THIS BUILDING'S
STATE-OF-TH E-ART

18:18.960 --> 18:20.131
INSULATION IS DOING
ONE HELL OF A JOB

18:20.180 --> 18:22.045
INSULATING THESE
UNSUBS FROM US.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.397
AND THE CLOCK
IS TICKING.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.008
WE NEED TO GET EYES
IN THERE ASAP.

18:25.060 --> 18:26.539
I HATE TO GO IN THERE
FLYING BLIND.

18:26.580 --> 18:28.275
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDER
THAT POSSIBILITY.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.924
THE RISK OF A BLIND BREACH
IS FAR OUTWEIGHED

18:29.970 --> 18:31.141
BY THE RISK
OF OUR FURTHER DELAY.

18:31.190 --> 18:32.623
BY MY CALCULATIONS,

18:32.670 --> 18:34.103
THEY STILL HAVE
THE C-4 ON THEIR SIDE.

18:34.150 --> 18:35.230
SO, I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT READY

18:35.280 --> 18:36.804
TO START ADDING UP
ACCEPTABLE LOSSES

18:36.850 --> 18:38.670
WITHOUT FIRST
EXHAUSTING EVERY OTHER

18:38.720 --> 18:39.800
SCENARIO OPEN TO US.

18:39.850 --> 18:41.158
WHAT OTHER SCENARIO?

18:41.200 --> 18:43.668
LIKE GE'I'I'ING THE BASTARD ON
THE PHONE AND TALKING.

18:43.730 --> 18:44.799
LEWIS: GUYS.

18:46.820 --> 18:48.856
PHONE'S CLEAN. NO DNA,

18:48.910 --> 18:51.299
NO PRINTS,
AND THE UNSUB'S NUMBER

18:51.340 --> 18:53.513
SEEMS TO TRACE BACK
TO A DISPOSABLE BURNER.

18:53.560 --> 18:55.289
BUT IT DOES SAY SOMETHING

18:55.350 --> 18:57.910
THAT HE CHOSE TO LABEL
HIMSELF "BAD GUY #1."

18:57.960 --> 18:59.609
KIND OF LIKE A DARK
CLASS CLOWN.

18:59.660 --> 19:00.991
THIS GUY REALLY
CRAVES A'I'I'ENTION.

19:01.050 --> 19:02.950
ABSOLUTELY. I MEAN,
HE WANTS TO TALK TO US.

19:03.010 --> 19:05.831
HE NEEDS TO,
IF ONLY TO SHOW OFF.

19:05.880 --> 19:09.008
ALVEZ: BUT I'M SURE HIS PLAN
CALLS FOR RADIO SILENCE.

19:09.060 --> 19:11.836
YEAH. THAT'S WHY I THINK
I SHOULD START TEXTING HIM.

19:11.880 --> 19:14.269
HEY. D.C. METRO JUST FOUND
A SUSPICIOUS VAN

19:14.320 --> 19:16.971
ABANDONED ALONG THE VEXTEL
SECURITY TEAM'S WORK ROUTE.

19:17.020 --> 19:18.885
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO
CHECK IT OUT.

19:54.450 --> 19:55.883
IS THERE A PROBLEM?

19:55.930 --> 19:56.965
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SHOT HER.

19:57.020 --> 19:58.180
SO WHAT?

19:58.240 --> 19:59.889
SO WHAT?

19:59.930 --> 20:01.921
SO YOU WANT THEM TO THINK
WE'RE WILLING TO NEGOTIATE?

20:01.980 --> 20:03.277
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.934
HE JUST BE'I'I'ER HAVE
ALL OF OUR MONEY

20:04.980 --> 20:05.969
WHEN THIS IS OVER.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.236
HE WILL.

20:07.290 --> 20:08.769
BUT YOU KNOW
THIS IS ABOUT MORE

20:08.810 --> 20:10.368
THAN JUST MONEY,
MY FRIEND.

20:10.420 --> 20:12.468
LOOK, I KNOW
BECAUSE YOU AND HE

20:12.510 --> 20:14.068
ARE BOTH HORSEMEN,
YOU TRUST--

20:14.120 --> 20:16.588
HE'S THE ONE.
I'M TELLING YOU.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.858
SURE.

20:20.910 --> 20:22.866
DON'T YOU WORRY
ABOUT A THING.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.784
MAN: COME ON, QUICK.
THE DRIVER'S SIDE IS...

20:39.890 --> 20:41.494
OFFICER: STAND DOWN.

20:42.540 --> 20:44.405
THAN KS.

20:45.850 --> 20:48.717
SO, CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

20:48.760 --> 20:50.409
UH, YEAH. ME AND NATE,
WE JUST GOT DONE

20:50.460 --> 20:52.928
WITH THE POLK BUILDING.
I RADIOED THE OFFICE

20:52.990 --> 20:54.594
AND THEN WHAM!
THESE TWO DUDES,

20:54.640 --> 20:56.028
THEY COME OUT OF NOWHERE.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.638
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
DESCRIBE THEM TO ME?

20:57.690 --> 20:59.339
THEY WAS DEFINITELY
A COUPLE OF...

20:59.380 --> 21:00.904
YOU KNOW, WHITE DUDES,

21:00.950 --> 21:02.338
BUT I DIDN'T GET
A GOOD LOOK AT THEM

21:02.390 --> 21:04.813
'CAUSE THEY HAD BANDANNAS
OVER THEIR FACES.

21:04.870 --> 21:06.349
THEY PUSHED US IN THE VAN,

21:06.390 --> 21:07.516
TOLD US TO GIVE UP
EVERYTHING,

21:07.570 --> 21:08.821
INCLUDING OUR UNIFORMS.

21:08.870 --> 21:10.474
AND THEN ONE GUY,
HE TIES US UP,

21:10.530 --> 21:11.736
WHILE THE OTHER GUY,
HE SAYS...

21:11.790 --> 21:13.473
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THEM.

21:15.830 --> 21:19.652
AND THAT'S WHEN
I THOUGHT WE WERE DEAD.

21:27.060 --> 21:29.278
BUT HE DIDN'T DO IT.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.399
I DON'T GET IT.

21:30.460 --> 21:32.018
I MEAN,
I'M GRATEFUL AS HELL,

21:32.070 --> 21:35.983
BUT WHY TELL THE OTHER GUY
THAT HE WAS GONNA TAKE--

21:36.030 --> 21:39.636
TAKE CARE OF US
IF THAT'S NOT WHAT
HE WAS GONNA DO?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.242
PRENTISS:
SO, ONE OF THE UNSUBS

21:42.300 --> 21:45.076
CHOSE TO SPARE THE LIVES
OF THE VEXTEL CREW.

21:45.120 --> 21:46.997
NOT ONLY DID HE SPARE
THEIR LIVES,

21:47.040 --> 21:48.428
HE DELIBERATELY
LIED TO HIS PARTNER.

21:48.480 --> 21:50.038
REID: SO IF OUR UNSUBS
HAVE BEEN CULLED

21:50.090 --> 21:51.512
FROM THE RANKS
OF THE HORSEMEN,

21:51.570 --> 21:52.867
THEN IT SEEMS
THAT ONE OF THEM'S

21:52.920 --> 21:54.911
HAVING SOME DOUBTS ABOUT
THEIR MANIFEST DESTINY.

21:54.960 --> 21:56.348
AND THAT ONE MAY NOT
BE SO KEEN

21:56.400 --> 21:58.482
ON SACRIFICING HIMSELF
FOR THE CAUSE.

21:59.660 --> 22:02.049
LEONARD HAGLAND
HAS ARRIVED.

22:05.410 --> 22:10.052
YOU BUREAU BOYS
ARE SOMETHING ELSE.

22:10.110 --> 22:11.919
YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE
I'M ABOUT TO GET

22:11.980 --> 22:13.368
A BIG OLD NEEDLE
IN MY VEINS

22:13.410 --> 22:14.809
THAT YOU CAN BRING ME
IN HERE

22:14.850 --> 22:18.502
AND I JUST MIGHT
BREAK DOWN AND SNITCH?

22:18.550 --> 22:21.633
I'M SUPERVISORY
SPECIAL AGENT DAVID ROSSI.

22:21.680 --> 22:22.851
NOW, THE REASON THAT I--

22:22.900 --> 22:24.504
YEAH, YOU MUST
HAVE ME CONFUSED

22:24.560 --> 22:26.369
WITH ONE OF YOUR
MAFIA COUSINS,

22:26.430 --> 22:28.421
'CAUSE I DON'T
BEND OVER LIKE THAT.

22:28.470 --> 22:32.816
WOW! STICKS AND STONES,
LENNY.

22:32.870 --> 22:35.304
BUT I GOTTA SAY,
I WAS EXPECTING

22:35.350 --> 22:37.818
SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE
INTIMIDATING

22:37.870 --> 22:41.089
FROM THE NOTORIOUS LEADER
OF THE HORSEMEN,

22:41.140 --> 22:43.301
BUT THEN YOU'RE JUST
THE PUNK-ASS COWARD

22:43.360 --> 22:46.705
WHO SHOT TWO VIRGINIA STATE
TROOPERS IN THE BACK.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.741
I ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE.

22:48.800 --> 22:50.665
THOSE MEN
WERE TRESPASSING
ON MY PROPERTY.

22:50.710 --> 22:52.883
THEY WERE THERE
TO ASSASSINATE ME.

22:52.930 --> 22:55.626
IT'S ALL PART OF YOUR
FBI/ATF GESTAPO.

22:55.670 --> 22:57.934
WHOA, WHOA. YOU KNOW,
I WISH WE HAD TIME TO CHAT,

22:57.980 --> 22:59.800
BUT THERE'S SOME MEN
WHO HAVE TAKEN

22:59.850 --> 23:02.762
A WHOLE BUNCH
OF INNOCENT PEOPLE HOSTAGE,

23:02.810 --> 23:06.155
AND THEIR ONLY DEMAND
IS THAT WE SET YOU FREE.

23:06.210 --> 23:08.815
NOW, DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

23:08.860 --> 23:10.771
WHO ARE THE HOSTAGES?

23:10.820 --> 23:12.037
THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

23:12.080 --> 23:13.900
YOU DON'T SEE IT,
DO YOU?
SEE WHAT?

23:13.950 --> 23:15.349
THE AWAKENING.

23:15.390 --> 23:17.472
'CAUSE THIS CROOKED
SYSTEM HAS CHOSEN

23:17.520 --> 23:19.306
TO CRUCIFY MEN LIKE ME.

23:19.350 --> 23:21.432
IT'S FORCED A SWORD
TO BE DRAWN

23:21.480 --> 23:24.916
THAT WILL REFRESH
THE TREE OF LIBERTY

23:24.960 --> 23:26.222
WITH BLOOD AN D--

23:26.270 --> 23:27.749
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT
SOUNDS LIKE TO ME,

23:27.790 --> 23:29.348
BESIDES A WHOLE BUNCH OF BS?

23:29.400 --> 23:32.870
THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A NON-DENIAL DENIAL.

23:32.930 --> 23:35.012
I GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

23:36.500 --> 23:39.230
TODAY YOU GOT SOME
INNOCENT FOLK
BEING HELD HOSTAGE.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.010
BUT TOMORROW, TOMORROW,
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

23:42.070 --> 23:45.369
JUDGMENT WILL MARCH
RIGHT TO THE HEART

23:45.420 --> 23:48.116
OF THE FBI
AND CUT IT OUT.

23:48.160 --> 23:51.425
LENNY, ARE YOU
THREATENING ME?

23:51.470 --> 23:53.938
NO, I'M JUST, UH...

23:53.990 --> 23:56.333
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

24:32.940 --> 24:35.591
GARCIA: OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD. IT'S KRISTY!

24:35.640 --> 24:37.904
SHE CALLED 911.
THEY PATCHED HER
THROUGH TO ME.

24:40.820 --> 24:42.515
KRISTY?

24:42.560 --> 24:43.902
YOU OK?

24:43.960 --> 24:44.995
I'M OK.

24:45.040 --> 24:46.211
HOW MANY MEN
ARE HOLDING YOU?

24:46.260 --> 24:48.524
THERE ARE 3, IN THEIR 20$.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.788
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT COULD
REALLY HELP US RIGHT NOW

24:50.830 --> 24:52.957
IS IF YOU COULD USE
YOUR PHONE'S CAMERA

24:53.010 --> 24:54.523
TO SHOW US WHAT'S
GOING ON IN THERE.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.968
I KNOW. I KNOW.

24:56.010 --> 24:57.705
BUT THEY TOOK
ALL OF OUR DEVICES,

24:57.750 --> 24:59.570
SO THIS ISN'T MY PHONE.

24:59.620 --> 25:00.962
IT'S THE ONE
I JUST BOUGHT YOU.

25:01.020 --> 25:02.965
BUT EVEN WITHOUT
THE SERVICE BEING ACTIVATED,

25:03.020 --> 25:04.840
IT LET ME MAKE
AN EMERGENCY CALL.

25:04.890 --> 25:06.881
CAN YOU ACTIVATE
THE PHONE
SHE'S CALLING FROM?

25:06.940 --> 25:08.931
I SURE CAN. GIVE ME A SEC.

25:12.590 --> 25:15.058
KRISTY. ..

25:15.120 --> 25:18.851
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

25:18.900 --> 25:20.902
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

25:22.340 --> 25:23.728
OH, NO.

25:23.780 --> 25:26.510
KRISTY

25:35.440 --> 25:38.910
ALL RIGHT, CAN I HAVE
EVERYONE'S ATTENTION?

25:38.970 --> 25:41.484
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
ANYONE ON THE OUTSIDE

25:41.540 --> 25:47.058
CARES WHETHER
YOU PEOPLE LIVE OR DIE.

25:47.110 --> 25:48.532
NO.

25:48.590 --> 25:49.716
GET UP.

25:49.760 --> 25:51.842
NO. NO, PLEASE.
PLEASE, LET ME GO.

25:51.890 --> 25:54.893
DON'T DO THIS!

25:54.940 --> 25:56.988
PLEASE, DON'T DO THIS!

25:57.030 --> 25:59.248
JUST LET ME GO!

25:59.900 --> 26:02.425
UHH!

26:05.040 --> 26:06.382
KRISTY?

26:35.630 --> 26:37.495
YOU THINK DROPPING BODIES
IS GONNA ACCELERATE

26:37.550 --> 26:39.586
GETTING YOU WHAT YOU WANT,
BUT IT WON'T.

26:39.640 --> 26:41.631
HAGLAND HAS JUST BEEN
RELEASED INTO FBI CUSTODY,

26:41.680 --> 26:43.238
BUT IF YOU DON'T KEEP
YOUR FINGER OFF THE TRIGGER,

26:43.290 --> 26:44.461
THAT'S WHERE IT ENDS.

26:44.510 --> 26:47.115
PLEASE SPARE ME
THE BORING DETAILS.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.638
JUST RELEASE HIM,
AND THIS IS OVER.

26:49.690 --> 26:51.339
I CAN KEEP THINGS
MOVING FORWARD,

26:51.390 --> 26:53.551
BUT I NEED YOU TO MAKE
A GOOD FAITH EFFORT.

26:53.610 --> 26:55.339
ALL RIGHT? A GESTURE.

26:55.390 --> 26:59.178
I NEED YOU TO RELEASE
JUST ONE HOSTAGE TO ME.

26:59.220 --> 27:00.391
JUST ONE.

27:33.430 --> 27:36.160
MATT, MATT,
ARE YOU STILL THERE?

27:36.210 --> 27:37.734
I'M HERE.

27:37.780 --> 27:40.340
OK. I'M READY TO DO THIS
WHEN YOU ARE.

27:40.390 --> 27:42.529
GARCIA, WE NEED
TO ACTIVATE THIS PHONE.

27:42.570 --> 27:44.265
YEAH, YEAH, I KNOW.
ALMOST THERE.

27:44.310 --> 27:46.619
AND WE ARE...

27:46.660 --> 27:51.222
LIVE. KRISTY SHOULD
BE ABLE TO SWITCH
TO A VIDEO CALL NOW.

27:55.060 --> 27:57.620
OH...MATT.

27:57.670 --> 28:00.059
IT'S REALLY GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

28:00.110 --> 28:01.930
YOU, TOO.

28:04.590 --> 28:07.980
OK, LET'S DO THIS.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.309
SO EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT NOW
BE ABLE TO KEEP TALKING TO YOU,

28:35.360 --> 28:37.146
I MIGHT STILL BE ABLE
TO HEAR YOU

28:37.190 --> 28:39.966
'CAUSE I HAVE THIS
WIRELESS EAR BUD IN.

28:44.020 --> 28:45.715
OK. I HOPE THAT HELPS.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.546
THAT'S PERFECT.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.112
PRENTISS: GARCIA, BACK TO YOU.
WE NEED TO UPLINK THIS
TO THE COMMAND POST.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.628
ALREADY MAKING
THE CONNECTION.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.688
YOU'RE LOOKING
AT DALTON MCCANN, 24,

29:02.740 --> 29:05.425
AND THIS IS JASPER TALBOT, 26.

29:05.480 --> 29:07.345
BOTH OF THEM ARE EX-ARMY,

29:07.390 --> 29:09.608
DISHONORABLY DISCHARGED,
EX-CONS.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.434
THEY ARE
SUSPECTED FOR A SERIES

29:11.480 --> 29:13.004
OF BANK ROBBERIES
IN FLORIDA.

29:13.050 --> 29:14.096
SO I'VE BEEN
FOLLOWING UP

29:14.140 --> 29:15.357
ON SOME FRIENDS
OF HAGLAND,

29:15.400 --> 29:18.528
AND I FOUND A LEAD
ON OUR THIRD MAN.

29:18.580 --> 29:20.354
NOW, ACCORDING
TO VISITORS LOGS,

29:20.410 --> 29:22.753
THE YOUNG MAN SITTING
WITH LEONARD HAGLAND

29:22.800 --> 29:24.495
IS A ROLAND COLE.

29:24.540 --> 29:26.849
AND WHEN ROSSI ASKED ME
TO DO A LITTLE MORE DIGGING,

29:26.890 --> 29:29.450
I COULDN'T FIND ANY REAL
RECORD OF A ROLAND COLE.

29:29.500 --> 29:32.287
NOW, TAKE A LOOK
HOW THE TWO INTERACT
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

29:32.330 --> 29:33.456
REID: THE BODY
LANGUAGE DOES SUGGEST

29:33.510 --> 29:35.410
A PARTICULAR BOND
OF INTIMACY.

29:35.460 --> 29:37.724
ROSSI: YEAH. AND WHAT
I'M SEEING IS THE INTERPLAY

29:37.770 --> 29:39.465
BETWEEN A FATHER AND SON.

29:39.510 --> 29:42.297
EXCEPT THERE
IS NO OFFICIAL RECORD

29:42.340 --> 29:43.773
OF HAGLAND HAVING A SON.

29:43.820 --> 29:45.549
HE HAS 3 DAUGHTERS
FROM ONE WIFE.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.296
PRENTISS:
BUT YOU THINK HE ALSO HAS
AN ILLEGITIMATE SON.

29:48.350 --> 29:51.217
A SON DESPERATE TO BE
LEGITIMATELY ACKNOWLEDGED

29:51.260 --> 29:52.477
BY AN ABSENT FATHER.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.522
WELL, I'M STILL GOING
THROUGH THE ALDC FILES

29:54.570 --> 29:56.561
AND I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO VERIFY THAT INFORMATION.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.394
WE SHOULD DO THAT.
WE NEED THE DETAILS.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.442
I'M GONNA
GO GET CONFIRMATION

30:00.490 --> 30:02.355
RIGHT FROM THE SOURCE.

30:07.540 --> 30:11.453
WE KNOW THAT HIS NAME
ISN'T ROLAND COLE.

30:11.500 --> 30:16.028
AND NOT ONLY THAT, WE KNOW
THAT HE'S YOUR SON, LENNY,

30:16.070 --> 30:19.028
AND THAT HE'S THE ONE
LEADING THE CHARGE

30:19.070 --> 30:20.856
TO SET YOU FREE.

30:20.900 --> 30:22.504
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

30:22.550 --> 30:26.429
AND YOUR WIFE CLEARLY
HAS NO IDEA.

30:26.470 --> 30:30.429
BUT I HONESTLY WISH
THAT SHE'D BEEN THE ONE
WHO'D GIVEN HIM TO ME.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.425
BUT THAT IS NOT
HOW IT WAS INTENDED,

30:32.480 --> 30:35.176
BECAUSE
THE GOOD LORD, WELL,

30:35.220 --> 30:38.656
HE WORKS
IN MYSTERIOUS WAYS.

30:38.700 --> 30:41.749
IF YOU CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT YOUR SON,

30:41.790 --> 30:43.655
WHY WOULD YOU BE WILLING
TO SACRIFICE HIM

30:43.710 --> 30:45.871
FOR SOME VAIN EFFORT--

30:45.930 --> 30:48.319
OH, SPARE ME YOUR
SANCTIMONIOUS
CRAP, AGENT ROSSI.

30:48.360 --> 30:50.089
NOW, DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO SAVE THE LIVES

30:50.150 --> 30:52.402
OF THOSE INNOCENT PEOPLE,
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

30:52.450 --> 30:53.929
THAT'S WHY YOU BROUGHT ME
IN HERE TO BEGIN WITH.

30:53.980 --> 30:55.197
I COULD TALK TO THE BOY.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.844
I WISH YOU COULD
TALK TO HIM.

30:56.890 --> 30:58.972
BUT...

30:59.030 --> 31:01.544
I'D LIKE SOMETHING
IN RETURN.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.376
OF COURSE YOU DO.

31:03.420 --> 31:05.468
NOW, I'M NOT ASKING
TO GET OUT OF JAIL.

31:07.080 --> 31:09.298
I JUST WANT
TO GET OFF DEATH ROW.

31:09.340 --> 31:11.467
GET ME OFF DEATH ROW
AND GET ME INTO
A FEDERAL FACILITY

31:11.520 --> 31:15.035
WHERE I CAN SERVE OUT
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.864
THAT AFRAID
TO MEET YOUR MAKER?

31:16.910 --> 31:20.869
I'M AFRAID YOU DON'T
HAVE MUCH TIME.

31:27.230 --> 31:28.788
WELL?

31:31.320 --> 31:33.356
I'M NOT HERE
TO NEGOTIATE.

31:35.020 --> 31:37.580
THEN THE BLOOD
OF ALL THOSE ALDC FOLKS

31:37.630 --> 31:39.530
IS ON YOUR HANDS.

31:43.330 --> 31:46.197
THANKS FOR THE HELP, LENNY.

31:50.950 --> 31:53.202
SO, IF ROLAND COLE
IS HAGLAND'S SON,

31:53.250 --> 31:55.036
THEN THE WAY TO DEFUSE
THIS SITUATION RIGHT NOW

31:55.080 --> 31:56.809
IS TO SOMEHOW
UNDERMINE HIS BELIEF

31:56.870 --> 31:59.031
THAT THIS SACRIFICE
IS GONNA EARN HIM

31:59.090 --> 32:00.512
HIS FATHER'S
LONG-WITHHELD APPROVAL.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.640
WELL, ONE WAY WE CAN START
TO GET INSIDE OF HIS HEAD

32:02.700 --> 32:05.305
IS BY USING HIS REAL NAME.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.045
LOOKS LIKE IT'S JOSH MARTIN.

32:14.100 --> 32:16.318
SIMMONS: ALSO, I'M NOT SURE
IF KRISTY'S EVEN AWARE

32:16.360 --> 32:18.237
OF HOW MUCH DEEP
BACKGROUND RESEARCH

32:18.280 --> 32:20.407
THE ALDC DID ON HAGLAND
AND HIS HORSEMEN,

32:20.460 --> 32:22.325
BUT THE RUMOR WAS
THAT MOST OF THEIR MONEY

32:22.370 --> 32:24.804
CAME FROM RUNNING
ILLEGAL GUNS THROUGH MEXICO.

32:24.850 --> 32:27.933
JAREAU: AND THEN
UP INTO NEW MEXICO,

32:27.980 --> 32:29.982
WHERE JOSH
WAS BORN AND RAISED.

32:30.030 --> 32:34.023
MATT, HOW CONFIDENT
ARE YOU THAT THIS
RESEARCH IS ACCURATE?

32:34.080 --> 32:35.331
YOU'RE ASKING BECAUSE
YOU WANT TO KNOW

32:35.380 --> 32:36.506
IF THAT'S WHO JOSH'S
MOTHER REALLY WAS?

32:36.560 --> 32:37.902
YOU KNOW I NEVER SAY DIE.

32:37.950 --> 32:39.030
I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH
MY DIGITAL BAG OF TRICKS

32:39.080 --> 32:40.866
FIGURING A WAY TO HACK
THE BUILDING BACK

32:40.910 --> 32:41.899
FROM THE BAD GUYS.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.257
I FOUND A DISCREPANCY

32:43.300 --> 32:44.995
IN THE BLUEPRINTS
OF THE BUILDING SERVER

32:45.050 --> 32:47.951
AND THOSE ON FILE
AT VEXTEL SECURITY.

32:49.090 --> 32:50.819
WAIT, I THINK GARCIA
JUST FOUND IT.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.359
THIS IS THE WAY THEY
THINK THEY CAN GUARANTEE

32:52.400 --> 32:53.833
WALKING AWAY FROM THIS.

32:53.880 --> 32:55.051
WHAT DAMN GOOD
IS IT DOING?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.000
EROL, PLEASE,
BE QUIET.

32:57.060 --> 32:59.051
WE JUST NEED
TO STAY CALM.

33:05.280 --> 33:07.066
HEY.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.999
OH, NO.

33:45.240 --> 33:47.014
NO!

33:47.060 --> 33:49.016
HE FOUND THE CAMERA.

33:52.460 --> 33:54.155
WHAT, DO YOU WANT
TO HELP THE COPS?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.246
HUH

33:55.290 --> 33:57.190
IT WASN'T ME, I SWEAR!

33:57.250 --> 33:58.069
LET'S GIVE 'EM
SOMETHING TO WATCH.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.075
NO!

33:59.120 --> 34:00.553
GET UP!

34:00.600 --> 34:03.979
LET HIM G0. I DID IT.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.996
UHH!

34:06.040 --> 34:07.200
IT WAS MY PHONE.

34:07.260 --> 34:10.218
I PUT IT UP THERE.

34:10.260 --> 34:11.773
UHH!

34:11.830 --> 34:13.081
STOP! NO!

34:13.130 --> 34:15.086
AAH! NO!

34:15.140 --> 34:17.529
AAH! NO!

34:17.570 --> 34:18.912
AAH!

34:31.280 --> 34:34.545
WANT TO WATCH?

34:34.590 --> 34:35.841
WATCH THIS.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.815
LEWIS: KRISTY, KRISTY,
IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR US,

34:48.860 --> 34:50.999
REPEAT EVERY WORD I TELL YOU.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.120
JOSH.

34:52.170 --> 34:53.216
JOSH...

34:53.260 --> 34:54.386
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.305
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

35:00.220 --> 35:01.744
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

35:01.790 --> 35:03.746
I KNOW WHO YOU REALLY ARE.I KNOW WHO YOU REALLY ARE.

35:03.790 --> 35:04.961
YOUR NAME IS JOSH MARTIN.

35:05.010 --> 35:05.874
YOUR NAME IS JOSH MARTIN.

35:05.920 --> 35:07.262
THAT'S RIGHT.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.355
LEWIS: ...GUNS THROUGH MEXICO.
AND THAT'S WHERE...

35:10.020 --> 35:11.578
THE HORSEMEN WERE RUNNING
GUNS THROUGH MEXICO,

35:11.630 --> 35:13.359
AND THAT'S WHERE LEONARD
HAGLAND MET GABRIELA.

35:13.410 --> 35:15.662
LEWIS: HE TOOK HER
AS HIS MISTRESS...
HE TOOK HER
AS HIS MISTRESS...

35:15.720 --> 35:17.233
HE SNUCK HER
ACROSS THE BORDER...

35:17.280 --> 35:18.281
AND THEN HE SNUCK HER
ACROSS THE BORDER

35:18.330 --> 35:20.230
AND MOVED HER
TO NEW MEXICO.

35:20.290 --> 35:22.633
LEWIS: TRUTH OR...TRUTH OR CONSEQUENCES,
NEW MEXICO,

35:22.680 --> 35:23.806
WHERE SHE GAVE BIRTH
TO YOU, JOSH.

35:23.860 --> 35:24.849
SHUT UP!

35:24.900 --> 35:25.889
SHE'S GETTING IN HIS HEAD.

35:25.940 --> 35:27.077
SHUT UP!

35:27.120 --> 35:28.599
HEY...KRISTY: YOUR DAD
WAS HARDLY AROUND.

35:28.640 --> 35:29.982
WHERE'S MATT?

35:30.040 --> 35:31.109
KRISTY: AND IT WASN'T
UNTIL YEARS LATER

35:31.170 --> 35:32.512
THAT YOU FOUND OUT
IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD

35:32.560 --> 35:35.028
SHUT UP!A WHOLE OTHER
FAMILY IN VIRGINIA.

35:43.050 --> 35:44.347
IS SHE TELLING THE TRUTH?

35:44.400 --> 35:45.697
LOOK, THIS DOESN'T
MATTER RIGHT NOW.

35:45.750 --> 35:46.876
OF COURSE IT MATTERS!

35:53.450 --> 35:55.702
TALBOT: I'M SORRY,
DALTON, YOU WERE RIGHT.

35:55.760 --> 35:58.365
I MEAN, HERE WE ARE
RISKING OUR LIVES

35:58.410 --> 36:00.275
FOR SOME DAMN HALF-BREED!

36:02.020 --> 36:04.454
TRAITOR.

36:04.510 --> 36:05.761
PLEASE STOP.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.801
LOOK, DON'T YOU SAY
ANOTHER WORD.

36:09.680 --> 36:10.988
GET DOWN!

36:18.820 --> 36:19.957
FBI!

36:20.000 --> 36:21.774
LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS!

36:21.830 --> 36:24.651
PUT 'EM DOWN!

36:33.970 --> 36:35.278
YOU GET HIM?

36:35.320 --> 36:37.880
NO. BUT DAMN IT,
THEY FOUND THE VENT.

36:37.930 --> 36:39.010
WE HAVE TO SEAL THAT UP.

36:39.060 --> 36:41.016
ALL RIGHT.
YOU TAKE CARE OF THAT.

36:41.060 --> 36:43.369
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.
