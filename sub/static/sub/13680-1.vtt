that she prays for me.

Did she tell you that?
Did she talk about it at all?

You know, she prays a lot.

ever tell you guys

01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:35.771
about the time
I was lost in the forest?

God, when he wants us
to listen,

01:25:12.575 --> 01:25:13.876
sometimes he has
to do something

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:18.614
to pull us aside and say,
"Hey, pay attention."

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:20.916
