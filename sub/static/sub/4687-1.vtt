WEBVTT

01:22.583 --> 01:23.583
- Back up.
- Sure.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.711
-How many?
-Bridesmaids?

01:26.795 --> 01:27.879
-Yeah.
-Nine.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.213
Nine bridesmaids?

01:29.298 --> 01:32.925
My sisters, your sisters,
Sheila, Sloan, Maggie, and Diane.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.553
-Who's Sheila?
-My brother's wife Sheila. You've met her.

01:36.346 --> 01:37.972
-And who's Diane?
-Sawyer.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.850
And because you have nine bridesmaids...

01:40.934 --> 01:42.351
You need nine groomsmen.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.228
That's, like, a law?

01:44.313 --> 01:47.398
The groomsmen have to
walk the bridesmaids down the aisle.

01:47.483 --> 01:49.233
Well, Charlie's my best man.

01:49.318 --> 01:52.445
What if I have him just keep going back up
the aisle and fetching bridesmaids?

01:52.529 --> 01:55.615
Is there any chance Charlie is going to be
sober when the ceremony starts?

01:55.699 --> 01:57.492
I have news for you.
Your sisters will have taken

01:57.576 --> 01:59.160
a couple of dips from the well, too.

01:59.244 --> 02:02.371
Charlie, Don, Jim, Elliot, and who else?

02:02.664 --> 02:03.873
Mmm-mmm.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.541
There is no one else.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.294
I've worked very hard at cultivating
no friendships outside of work.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.921
And to be honest, I was doing fine

02:10.047 --> 02:12.548
cultivating no friendships inside of work
until you came along.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.133
You need five more.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.135
Nine bridesmaids is madness.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.971
The amount of time it's going to take
18 people to walk down the aisle...

02:19.056 --> 02:22.266
You're telling me Diane Sawyer's going to
put on a dress with puffy shoulders?

02:22.351 --> 02:24.435
The bridesmaids are wearing Vera Wang.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.312
Can Vera Wang make that many dresses?

02:26.396 --> 02:29.690
-How about Brian Williams? You love Brian.
-You love Brian.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.984
And if he's up there next to me,
you're gonna start to think.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.612
In fact, the whole idea
of parading a bunch of well-dressed men

02:34.696 --> 02:36.697
in front of you
right before you're asked the big question...

02:36.782 --> 02:38.825
And don't get me wrong,
but I've now seen you commit

02:38.909 --> 02:41.452
to three different shades of tile
for the master bath before...

02:41.537 --> 02:43.454
-Did you see that?
-What?

02:45.415 --> 02:46.833
- What is it?
- Switcher.

02:46.917 --> 02:50.336
Ben, what feed are you running
on 44B in the bull pen?

02:50.420 --> 02:52.171
<i>That's a local Boston affiliate.</i>

02:52.256 --> 02:54.257
<i>- Somebody wanted to watch the marathon.</i>
- What'd you see?

02:55.634 --> 02:56.759
An explosion.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.303
What just happened in Boston?

02:59.388 --> 03:01.013
I've got multiple alerts, all red.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.849
Blast at the finish line of the marathon.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.684
Runners and spectators fleeing the scene.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.185
The finish line's at the Lenox Hotel.

03:06.270 --> 03:07.770
-There might be a fire.
-Look at that runner.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.689
- Can we get some audio?
- The way he falls to the side.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.065
That's an energy force.
That's an explosion.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.859
-Break them into teams.
-Boston affiliate.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.111
Boston PD. FBI. DOJ.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.071
Homeland Security. Area hospitals.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.031
- Jenna!
- On it!

03:23.662 --> 03:26.372
And five and four

03:26.456 --> 03:28.040
and three

03:28.125 --> 03:31.335
and two and one.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.963
Okay, take a breath and...

03:35.132 --> 03:36.883
Okay, hot stuff, what you got?

03:37.634 --> 03:39.260
Come on, focus.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.053
Focus. You're bad.

03:41.138 --> 03:43.472
You are bad. You're a bad fucking lady.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.932
--Give me 10 more.

03:45.017 --> 03:46.976
No phone. Tune that out.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.186
Love the pain. Eat the pain.

03:49.271 --> 03:52.732
Counting six and five

03:52.816 --> 03:55.902
and four, and you stopped.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.947
Good session.

04:00.032 --> 04:02.742
Can you confirm that the explosions
were caused by bombs and not a gas line?

04:02.826 --> 04:04.994
Were there any credible threats
made in advance of the race?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.287
This is Martin Stallworth at ACN.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.039
This is Tess Westin at ACN.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.790
SWAT's
<i>on the scene along with K-9 units.</i>

04:09.875 --> 04:11.751
I want to get
accurate information out quickly, Mike.

04:11.835 --> 04:15.254
We're both doing a job and I'm at
the only reliable breaking news network.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.256
Except for that one time, yes.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.883
I've got an image of the area
around the finish line.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.384
Throw it up on the front monitors.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.011
Can you tell me
if you've got terrorist groups...

04:22.638 --> 04:24.180
Use the number in this. It's the White House.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.765
Don't ask who's on the other end
of the phone.

04:25.849 --> 04:26.891
Just say it's for me.

04:26.975 --> 04:30.227
Is anyone getting through to
the trauma center or the ER at Mass General?

04:30.312 --> 04:33.481
Nobody's picking up at Mass General,
Brigham and Women's, Beth Israel.

04:33.565 --> 04:36.108
- That's not a good sign.
- When is she breaking in?

04:36.193 --> 04:38.027
When she knows what she's breaking in with.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.821
-That's right, right?
-We're gonna do this thing well.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.366
-We are.
-Do you know what that means, doing it well?

04:44.076 --> 04:45.242
Yeah.

04:45.327 --> 04:46.702
She's holding for you.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.246
- Yeah?
-  "2:52 P.M.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.248
-"I don't know what the fuck that was..."
-Hang on.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.376
"...but I'm shaking.
Everyone's sprinting through the Back Bay.

04:53.460 --> 04:56.379
"2:54, explosions on Boylston Street.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.798
"2:54, mass casualty incident declared

04:58.882 --> 05:00.925
"at the end of the Boston Marathon route."

05:01.009 --> 05:02.885
I'm not putting Will on the air
to say something bad

05:02.970 --> 05:05.137
may have happened in Boston,
but we're not sure what.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.639
This isn't speculative anymore.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.767
We're not going based
on tweets from witnesses we can't talk to.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.894
What credible news agency would do that?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.896
- Fox is up.
- Ugh!

05:14.147 --> 05:15.147
Jim.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.358
The president's been
notified of the incident in Boston.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.986
What is the incident in Boston?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.112
They were hoping we knew.

05:21.405 --> 05:22.571
What am I looking at?

05:23.156 --> 05:24.824
That's Boylston Street. That's the finish line.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.993
Over there's the Lenox Hotel.
That's where the blast came from.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.869
-Inside the hotel?
-We don't know.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.664
If I learn what happened
by watching the news,

05:31.748 --> 05:34.375
I'm going to lose my fucking mind!

05:34.459 --> 05:36.002
We're dramatically understaffed.

05:36.086 --> 05:38.004
-Where's Keefer?
-Don's got jury duty today.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.588
Are you kidding? Get him out.

05:40.924 --> 05:42.925
I'm a schoolteacher. I teach fourth grade.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.678
- Where?
- P.S. 40 here in Manhattan.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.304
You ever bought
anything over the phone?

05:47.389 --> 05:48.389
- Yes.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.182
From one of those commercials
you see on TV?

05:50.267 --> 05:51.934
Yes.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.185
What have you bought?

05:53.270 --> 05:55.980
I bought something
that removes scratches from your car.

05:56.064 --> 05:58.899
- Good. Anything else?
- No.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.860
And did you have
a good experience with that product?

06:00.944 --> 06:02.695
Your Honor, may I approach the bench?

06:02.779 --> 06:03.904
What? Why?

06:03.989 --> 06:06.198
I really can't say in front of all.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.284
-If I could just...
-Approach. Hurry up.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.329
Um...

06:12.956 --> 06:15.708
My name is Don Keefer.
I'm a producer at ACN.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.960
There's been an explosion
at the finish line of the Boston Marathon

06:18.045 --> 06:19.628
and I have to get back to my newsroom.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.213
-Was anyone injured?
-I don't know.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.007
-Was it a terrorist attack?
-I don't know.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.342
-Do they have a suspect?
-These are all things I'd like the answer to,

06:25.427 --> 06:26.761
but I can't find them out from here.

06:26.845 --> 06:27.887
- Mr...
- Keefer.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.597
All these people have someplace else to be.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.058
I'm sure your network
can do the news without you.

06:32.142 --> 06:34.477
You're probably right,
but I'd hate for my boss to find that out.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.228
Take your seat.

06:36.354 --> 06:39.398
Uh, look, you don't want
leaders on the jury, right?

06:39.483 --> 06:41.609
Anyone who can take charge
during deliberations.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.737
I run a news broadcast five nights a week
with a staff of 60,

06:44.821 --> 06:46.363
and I bend them to my will.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.240
Plus, I'm currently
the defendant in two lawsuits

06:48.325 --> 06:49.617
being brought by the same person,

06:49.701 --> 06:52.745
so even though I bought
your client's bagel slicer at 3:00 A.M.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.413
and it nearly took my fingers off,

06:54.498 --> 06:57.166
there is simply no way in hell
that I am finding for the plaintiff.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.918
-Get out of here.
-Thank you.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.930
Hey. You got dismissed from jury duty?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.307
Sort of. What are you doing?

07:13.391 --> 07:15.768
They finally got one for me.
A Bloomberg terminal.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.479
This is a $24,000 system
that gives me instantaneous access

07:18.563 --> 07:20.106
to all the financial information in the world.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.608
Do you know
what's going on outside your door?

07:25.195 --> 07:26.695
It's not on there.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.991
-When are we breaking in?
-When Mac says so.

07:33.703 --> 07:35.454
-Neal.
-Yeah?

07:35.539 --> 07:40.417
I'm tracking 2,221 tweets
describing two explosions

07:40.502 --> 07:42.503
at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.046
What exactly are we waiting for?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.923
Are any of them from official sources?

07:46.049 --> 07:48.968
Do you guys understand
the explosion occurred in the 21 st century?

07:49.052 --> 07:50.302
Welcome to ACN.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.974
By the way, there's a message that came in
for you personally over the secure site.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.559
Someone wants your encryption key.

07:56.643 --> 07:59.270
Ah, it's just a conspiracy sleuth
eating cat food. Put it aside.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.150
But if it was a bomb,
<i>obviously that escalates...</i>

08:04.234 --> 08:05.609
<i>There have been a lot of questions</i>

08:05.694 --> 08:07.361
<i>about how many you've been able to treat.</i>

08:07.445 --> 08:10.030
We haven't...
<i>Some who initially were unidentified.</i>

08:10.115 --> 08:11.991
<i>The Supreme Court hears a patent case</i>

08:12.075 --> 08:14.326
<i>involving companies that</i>
<i>are patenting human genes.</i>

08:14.411 --> 08:16.203
No, no, guys. Take your time.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.955
<i>...to debate gun control.</i>

08:18.039 --> 08:19.999
<i>And on the lighter side of things...</i>

08:20.208 --> 08:22.710
We have to ask ourselves
if we're being gun-shy because of Genoa.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.171
I don't see anything wrong
with being gun-shy because of Genoa.

08:25.297 --> 08:27.506
-I do.
-When Reagan was shot in '81,

08:27.591 --> 08:29.049
the three networks went live.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.552
"Reagan was shot."
"No, he wasn't." "Yes, he was."

08:31.636 --> 08:34.680
"James Brady is dead." "No, he's not."
It was mayhem.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.349
We're not first, so we might as well be last
and know something.

08:37.434 --> 08:38.893
I agree. What about you?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.686
It's more than getting our facts straight.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.314
It's more than getting our facts straight
or having facts.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.524
-Facts are important.
-Facts are important, obviously.

08:45.609 --> 08:49.236
But, look, Mrs. Lansing told us to
get the trust of the audience back,

08:49.321 --> 08:53.032
and here it is,
an unwelcome opportunity to be sure.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.867
-Will, there's not really...
-Here's what I'm trying to say.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.952
These situations can be like church.

08:57.078 --> 09:00.706
They can be... They can show us what...
They can guide us in...

09:00.790 --> 09:02.208
This isn't going to be a reality show.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.877
We don't do good TV. We do the news.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.795
-I said that.
-I know, and you were 100...

09:06.922 --> 09:09.215
Americans are serious people

09:09.299 --> 09:11.926
and we can reflect
that back to them in the worst of times.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.679
Exalting their dignity
by showing a little of it ourselves.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.681
- By showing a lot of it.
- Will, they've got to keep...

09:17.766 --> 09:20.601
Don't reach for common ground.
Reach for higher ground.

09:20.685 --> 09:22.353
Am I saying this right?

09:22.437 --> 09:25.022
-He's saying we're the grown-ups.
-Get back to work.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.982
- I think I blew that speech.
- They got some of it.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.235
Nothing official yet?

09:29.319 --> 09:33.155
We know the Supreme Court
heard a case about patenting genes.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.241
-Pants?
-Genes!

09:35.325 --> 09:37.409
-Human genes!
-Take it easy.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.203
I want to go to Boston. It's my hometown.

09:39.287 --> 09:41.413
-I want to be on the ground.
-Take a producer.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.290
Amy's on vacation.
Leon's in Prague.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.460
Mac, Maggie can do it. She can do it.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.588
She knows Boston. She's cultivated sources.
She can do this now.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.800
I don't make those calls, but she gives me
anything less than I want and she's fired.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.427
I'll make that call 'cause I don't think
she's cut out for this anymore.

09:55.512 --> 09:56.595
She is.

09:58.682 --> 10:00.224
-Maggie.
-Yeah?

10:00.308 --> 10:02.059
-Do you have a go-bag?
-What?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.561
-A go-bag.
-I have a gym bag.

10:05.355 --> 10:06.438
Go!

10:07.565 --> 10:11.068
Confirmed, Boston PD and the FBI.
Two devices detonated...

10:11.152 --> 10:13.362
Herb, Jake, Joey, hijack the control room.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.698
- ...critical injuries. Affiliates at the scene.
- Let's go.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.831
...where
<i>they established a strategy</i>

10:23.915 --> 10:26.500
<i>for this January's bitterly contested budget,</i>

10:26.584 --> 10:28.961
<i>after which President Obama</i>
<i>and Senate Republicans</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:33.465
<i>agreed to a tax increase on 77% of Americans.</i>

10:33.550 --> 10:35.551
<i>So much for the president's promise</i>
<i>not to raise...</i>

10:35.635 --> 10:38.053
-Herb, let's get Boston up.
-Give her Boston on previews A and B.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.139
-Graphics on C.
-DC control, this is New York.

10:40.223 --> 10:42.308
We're making the handoff. Herb's got the con.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.977
This is Mac in New York. Stay with me.

10:45.061 --> 10:46.937
Two explosive devices have detonated

10:47.022 --> 10:49.023
at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.

10:49.107 --> 10:54.570
We go now to Juan Gomez
with our Boston affiliate WBAS TV,

10:54.654 --> 10:56.363
who's standing by live at the scene.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.449
Tap your pen for me if you copy.

10:59.576 --> 11:01.368
<i>Josie, I have to cut you off.</i>

11:01.453 --> 11:03.162
<i>We're getting</i>
<i>some breaking news out of Boston.</i>

11:03.246 --> 11:05.956
- Go, G1. Stand by, Boston.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.044
<i>Two explosive devices have detonated</i>

11:10.128 --> 11:12.546
<i>at the finish line of the Boston Marathon.</i>

11:12.630 --> 11:14.882
<i>And we want to take you now</i>
<i>to our Boston affiliate</i>

11:14.966 --> 11:17.843
<i>WBAS and Juan Gomez, who's at the scene.</i>

11:17.927 --> 11:19.595
<i>-Juan.</i>
-Good job.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.431
That was good back there.

11:22.515 --> 11:25.809
Why wasn't I able to put my finger
on what we're talking about, you and me?

11:25.894 --> 11:27.144
-You want to know why?
-Yeah.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.772
Because it's obvious.
Where the hell have you been?

11:29.856 --> 11:31.815
Shirking my civic responsibilities
as fast as I could.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.693
If it was a suicide bomber, there'd be a body.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.696
So whoever did it
is walking the streets of Boston right now

11:37.781 --> 11:41.241
and there's gonna be a manhunt
like we haven't seen since Dallas in '63.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.202
This is gonna go on for a while.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.372
Elliot's on his way to Boston,
Terry's on maternity leave,

11:46.456 --> 11:48.207
and we'll be a couple of anchors short.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.625
We'll take long shifts and double up.

11:49.709 --> 11:50.959
- Clear.
- Good luck.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.631
The explosions were 12 seconds apart

11:55.715 --> 11:57.716
and right now we've got
14 confirmed injuries,

11:57.801 --> 11:59.551
but that number is obviously not gonna hold.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.804
-Critical?
-We're hearing about amputations.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.477
-Thank you.
-It was a good speech before.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.021
Was it?
'Cause I didn't think it was nearly specific...

12:11.106 --> 12:12.773
Stand by, he's coming to you.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.943
<i>...and first responders</i>
<i>treating people on the scene.</i>

12:16.027 --> 12:17.903
<i>Juan, this is Will McAvoy in New York.</i>

12:17.987 --> 12:19.863
<i>...what is clearly a terrorist attack</i>

12:19.948 --> 12:22.324
at a sporting event followed around the world.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.452
Anthony Tagliano,
our law enforcement analyst, is standing by.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.329
Anthony, is there anything
you're able to read from...

12:27.414 --> 12:30.958
Welcome back to our breaking news coverage
of the Boston Marathon bombings.

12:31.042 --> 12:33.419
A White House official
tells us the president received a briefing...

12:33.503 --> 12:35.587
A trauma nurse at the scene
just told us the medical tent

12:35.672 --> 12:38.590
is dealing with everything
from severed limbs to severe burns.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.969
The victims are being taken away
by ambulances as they arrive at the scene.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.346
The finish line is located in the middle of four

12:44.431 --> 12:46.223
of the best hospitals in New England.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.350
...press conference just a few moments ago.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.437
Police Commissioner Ed Davis
has confirmed two deaths...

12:51.521 --> 12:53.439
- S-U-Z-I.
- Copy.

12:53.523 --> 12:56.358
- Suzi Ochi.
- Okay, we've got Suzi Ochi,

12:56.443 --> 12:59.528
an eyewitness who was finishing the race
when the explosions occurred.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.696
Suzi, can you hear me?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.203
-Maggie Jordan.
-Elliot Hirsch.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.080
I'm Eddie. I'm your cameraman and driver.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.791
Uh, you want to go to your hotel
and get checked in?

13:12.876 --> 13:14.501
We want to go to Boylston.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.174
<i>I'd literally</i>
<i>just crossed the finish line,</i>

13:20.258 --> 13:22.342
<i>took three steps, heard a loud explosion,</i>

13:22.427 --> 13:25.137
<i>turned around and there was</i>
<i>a cloud of smoke that appeared to be...</i>

13:25.221 --> 13:27.139
Will, we've got another confirmed casualty.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.016
Male, eight years old.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.476
<i>...you hear tons of applause.</i>

13:30.560 --> 13:32.936
<i>For a second I thought</i>
<i>that the bomb might even be thunder.</i>

13:33.062 --> 13:34.771
<i>Slow but steady recreational runners...</i>

13:34.856 --> 13:37.274
Bombs need detonators
like a garage door opener or something.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.359
How far away can a person be
from the device?

13:39.444 --> 13:41.153
<i>We've heard from authorities</i>
<i>that they believe these</i>

13:41.237 --> 13:43.113
<i>to be improvised devices.</i>

13:43.239 --> 13:46.909
What kind of detonator would that need
and does the person have to be present?

13:46.993 --> 13:48.744
<i>No, it can be a timed device</i>

13:48.828 --> 13:51.914
<i>and you can also be miles away</i>
<i>and set it off by calling a cell phone.</i>

13:52.415 --> 13:55.042
<i>Sloan, truthfully,</i>
<i>it's not hard to blow something up.</i>

13:55.126 --> 13:56.126
Recap.

13:56.211 --> 13:58.712
Thanks again
<i>to FBI profiler Frank Harris.</i>

13:58.796 --> 13:59.796
<i>To recap...</i>

14:03.927 --> 14:06.512
Okay, sir, thank you. Thank you for your time.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.804
That was a nurse.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.598
Surgeons are pulling ball bearings
out of patients

14:09.682 --> 14:11.225
in two different operating rooms right now.

14:11.309 --> 14:13.435
-Did he say...
-They're coming to you.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.938
Thirty one.

14:16.022 --> 14:19.024
<i>Sloan, I'm outside Boston's</i>
<i>Brigham and Women's Hospital</i>

14:19.108 --> 14:21.818
<i>where officials are telling us</i>
<i>they're currently treating 31 patients</i>

14:21.903 --> 14:25.113
<i>for injuries that range</i>
<i>from cuts and lacerations to amputations.</i>

14:25.198 --> 14:26.698
-This is good, Maggie.
-Yeah.

14:26.783 --> 14:29.117
...removing ball
<i>bearings from a patient's leg.</i>

14:29.202 --> 14:31.787
<i>Are the hospitals equipped</i>
<i>to handle the number of serious injuries?</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:33.539
The World Trade Center,
<i>of course, involved</i>

14:33.623 --> 14:35.791
<i>both thousands of people</i>
<i>and iconic buildings.</i>

14:35.875 --> 14:38.585
<i>Right, Will, and here it wasn't</i>
<i>an iconic building that was the target.</i>

14:38.670 --> 14:40.295
How are you doing?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.922
She got a ton of stuff first.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.007
-It's just that Mac wasn't willing to go...
-I know.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.677
Social media is going to solve this crime.

14:46.761 --> 14:47.886
Crowdsourcing law enforcement.

14:47.971 --> 14:49.680
That went off without a hitch in Salem.

14:50.473 --> 14:53.433
Go home and sleep a few hours
and then come back and relieve Neal.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.851
I've got to post a column.

14:54.936 --> 14:57.104
Do it from home. We're gonna need fresh legs.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.565
-What about you?
-I'll stay a couple more hours.

15:00.441 --> 15:01.483
Okay.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.570
I'll see you later.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.239
Wait, what was the thing from this afternoon?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.449
The guy who wanted my encryption key.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.159
I put it in your desktop under "cat food."

15:12.120 --> 15:13.203
See you in a little bit.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.998
<i>As of yet, no individuals or groups</i>
<i>have claimed responsibility.</i>

15:20.336 --> 15:21.962
<i>She didn't seem surprised,</i>
<i>but she did suspect</i>

15:22.046 --> 15:24.590
<i>it was an indication that</i>
<i>this wasn't an organized terror cell.</i>

15:24.674 --> 15:26.091
<i>Did your source indicate</i>
<i>what she believes</i>

15:26.175 --> 15:27.634
<i>might have motivated the bombing?</i>

15:27.719 --> 15:29.303
<i>At this time she can only speculate.</i>

15:29.387 --> 15:32.014
<i>The Boston Police Department</i>
<i>is questioning local people</i>

15:32.098 --> 15:34.683
<i>in connection with the bombings,</i>
<i>but they have no one in custody.</i>

15:34.767 --> 15:36.768
<i>The FBI is stepping in</i>
<i>to take over investigations,</i>

15:36.853 --> 15:38.186
- <i>-and we're being told that they've stopped</i>

15:38.271 --> 15:40.981
<i>all transportation into and out of the city</i>

15:41.065 --> 15:43.859
<i>and are combing through airport records,</i>
<i>a very daunting task...</i>

15:56.414 --> 15:58.707
<i>Among the three dead is an eight-year-old boy</i>

15:58.791 --> 16:01.209
whom The Boston Globe
<i>has identified this morning</i>

16:01.294 --> 16:04.755
<i>as Martin Richard</i>
<i>of Dorchester, Massachusetts.</i>

16:04.839 --> 16:08.008
<i>We understand</i>
<i>friends and family will gather tonight...</i>

16:08.092 --> 16:10.385
-You've got to like that.
-What's that?

16:10.470 --> 16:11.970
Oh, God, no, I didn't mean the boy.

16:12.055 --> 16:13.930
I meant that the hotel TV is tuned to ACN.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.850
They change it over from CNBC
when I eat breakfast here.

16:17.018 --> 16:19.645
If Maria Bartiromo walks in,
they'll find the remote in a hurry.

16:19.771 --> 16:21.271
Listen, I'm gonna need to get back...

16:21.356 --> 16:22.606
Hang on. You've got a tag.

16:24.734 --> 16:27.235
-Thank you.
-Someone didn't sleep at home last night.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.363
-I slept at my friend's and needed a fresh...
-Yeah.

16:29.447 --> 16:30.656
-April 10.
-Yeah.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.241
A lot of investors got caught out
when the Dow and S&P popped,

16:33.326 --> 16:36.244
and I'm hearing a number of hedge funds
were short the big indexes.

16:36.329 --> 16:37.871
-Who do you think won?
-Our clients.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.998
-Okay.
-Let me get that.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.416
-No.
-Come on, you got it last time.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.460
I'm not allowed to let
Goldman Sachs buy me breakfast.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.337
You had an English muffin.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.923
-Hey, you know Billy Posener?
-The head media guy at Merrill?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.175
Wife and two kids
and he was caught having an affair

16:50.259 --> 16:53.470
with his 24-year-old assistant,
whom he hired personally

16:53.554 --> 16:57.099
after two years of, I'm not joking,
circus school didn't work out.

16:57.392 --> 17:00.018
So he's gonna get fired
and Merrill's whole media department's

17:00.103 --> 17:01.687
gonna be without a rudder for a while.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.232
Or acrobats, probably. Thank you.

17:05.316 --> 17:06.525
Thank you, Ms. Sabbith.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.113
<i>In a news conference</i>
<i>that ended just minutes ago</i>

17:11.197 --> 17:13.573
<i>behind me at the state house,</i>
<i>Governor Deval Patrick</i>

17:13.658 --> 17:16.159
<i>has stated that only two devices were found.</i>

17:16.244 --> 17:17.994
<i>None of the other evidence</i>
<i>collected at the scene</i>

17:18.079 --> 17:21.373
<i>indicates that any other unexploded devices</i>
<i>will be found.</i>

17:21.457 --> 17:23.250
<i>The governor has also said...</i>

17:23.334 --> 17:25.794
-Yeah, it's my office.
-I'm just here.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.464
-You all right?
-I'm hiding from the twins.

17:29.549 --> 17:30.590
Who are the twins?

17:30.675 --> 17:33.093
I'd guess you'd have to say
my brother and sister.

17:33.594 --> 17:35.637
Until this moment,
I didn't know you had siblings.

17:35.722 --> 17:36.805
How's that possible?

17:37.265 --> 17:38.807
Half-brother, half-sister.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.268
My father's kids from his second wife.

17:41.352 --> 17:43.395
-Randy and Blair.
-Which one's which?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.480
-Doesn't really matter.
-What do they do?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.358
They go to parties. They go to clubs.
They order bottle service.

17:48.443 --> 17:49.735
They do a lot of philanthropic work

17:49.819 --> 17:52.237
as long as it's a party
at a club with bottle service.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.573
They're like the brothers
<i>from A Night at the Roxbury</i>

17:54.657 --> 17:56.658
if one of them was a woman
and the other one was dumber.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.244
They're up from South Beach
for one of several

17:59.328 --> 18:01.788
25th birthday parties
they're throwing for themselves.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.665
I take it your dad left them some money.

18:04.208 --> 18:06.418
-You work for them.
-They're stockholders?

18:06.502 --> 18:08.044
They will be when they turn 25.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.422
I'm supposed to be giving them
a tour of the building right now,

18:10.506 --> 18:13.467
but I just know they're gonna pass by
a monitor with coverage from Boston

18:13.551 --> 18:15.552
and one of them's gonna say,
"Oh, God, I just can't watch that.

18:15.636 --> 18:18.263
"It makes me too depressed."
And I'm gonna put their heads in a wall.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.016
So I'm hiding in here.

18:21.768 --> 18:22.934
Why here?

18:27.398 --> 18:30.233
This is embargoed until it crosses the tape.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.571
We're gonna miss
our earnings projections by a little.

18:42.371 --> 18:44.372
By a little?

18:44.457 --> 18:46.374
Did the Titanic miss New York Harbor
by a little?

18:46.459 --> 18:47.501
Feel free to pile on.

18:47.585 --> 18:48.794
You guys reaffirmed your guidance

18:48.878 --> 18:50.629
-for the quarter a month ago.
-I know.

18:50.713 --> 18:52.672
How could you do that if you knew
the numbers were gonna be bad?

18:52.757 --> 18:55.634
Qantas and Lufthansa decided they wanted
to use Rolls-Royce engines in their...

18:55.718 --> 18:57.219
-How did they keep that a secret?
-I don't know.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.472
The message I want to get out
is that this is a one-time thing

19:00.556 --> 19:02.265
and it's not gonna impact
our full-year guidance.

19:02.350 --> 19:03.767
We're on track to meet our final numbers.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.353
This is just a bump in the road.

19:06.437 --> 19:08.480
-You know I can't carry your water.
-I'm not asking you to.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.982
I'm just asking you to look at the big picture
and take it easy on us.

19:11.067 --> 19:14.945
The big picture is we're gonna be down
three to five points by the end of the week.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.238
Three to five?

19:23.579 --> 19:25.247
All right, it was fun talking to you.

19:31.212 --> 19:33.713
I know everyone on this floor
thinks I'm an asshole,

19:33.798 --> 19:36.216
but I run a good company.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.426
And that's all I've ever wanted to do.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.679
Run a good company
that makes good products.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.430
And we may have
a political difference on this,

19:42.515 --> 19:44.599
but I take a lot of pride in being a job creator.

19:45.685 --> 19:47.018
Okay.

19:47.103 --> 19:48.562
You really want to argue the indisputable fact

19:48.646 --> 19:51.565
that I cut paychecks to 141,000 people?

19:51.649 --> 19:53.942
Our difference of opinion isn't political,
it's religious.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.402
I'm an economist, and in my church,

19:55.486 --> 19:57.696
it's your customers who are the job creators.

19:57.780 --> 19:59.030
And no one here thinks you're an asshole.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.074
-Really?
-I do.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.035
Way to be up fourth with Boston.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.037
I swear to God, my Aunt Isadora,

20:06.122 --> 20:07.664
who is in a nursing home and blind,

20:07.748 --> 20:09.624
called me with the news
before it was on our air.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.794
If Mac allowed us to use
Aunt Isadora as a source...

20:13.212 --> 20:14.880
-What was that about?
-It's embargoed.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.715
Mmm. How was breakfast?

20:16.799 --> 20:19.259
I left the tag on the clothes I wore out
of Brooks Brothers this morning.

20:19.343 --> 20:20.343
We're not good at this.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.053
And she tried to give me
a message in a bottle.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.221
What was it?

20:23.306 --> 20:24.764
Merrill's media buyer is gonna lose his job

20:24.849 --> 20:25.974
because he's been having an affair

20:26.058 --> 20:28.602
with his 24-year-old assistant,
who used to be a circus performer.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.186
Oh.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.566
That was an involuntary response
you'd get from any man

20:34.650 --> 20:36.026
if he pictured a circus girl.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.152
Pictured her doing what?

20:37.820 --> 20:39.362
Why would she want you to know this?

20:39.488 --> 20:41.948
My guess is Goldman and Merrill
are competing to do a deal

20:42.033 --> 20:44.075
and she'd like me to weaken
the competition for her.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.579
The puzzle is, who's buying who?
And I like puzzles.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.998
-No, you don't.
-I love puzzles.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.209
You literally talk back to The New York Times
crossword. You yell at it.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.712
Can I tell you something
about The New York Times crossword?

20:55.796 --> 20:58.840
Very often they put the wrong number
of boxes in to house the correct word.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.675
-Yeah.
-But this one I'm gonna solve

21:00.760 --> 21:02.427
'cause I have my Bloomberg terminal.

21:02.511 --> 21:05.597
Tell me again what you get for $24,000
that I don't get for 1,500?

21:05.681 --> 21:07.933
-You wouldn't understand.
-Really?

21:09.518 --> 21:12.312
You know how there are tall women
who don't mind dating shorter guys?

21:12.396 --> 21:15.065
I don't mind that you're dumb.
And, Don, I mean that.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.484
Thank you.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.444
Can you tag Will out for a while?
He's got to eat something.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.154
Jim will catch you up
on where we are right now.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.199
-Where are we?
-Exactly where we were 12 hours ago.

21:27.453 --> 21:30.038
I'm gonna give us a soft B-plus
for the first day.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.791
Jenna! I thought it was a solid B-plus.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.210
-I'll tell you where we lost points.
-Yes?

21:35.336 --> 21:37.963
I'm almost certain I asked for French toast,
scrambled eggs, and bacon

21:38.047 --> 21:40.215
with a side order of bacon and a Dr Pepper.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.175
-You did.
-What do we have here?

21:42.301 --> 21:44.135
Greek yogurt, a gluten-free muffin,

21:44.220 --> 21:47.389
two hard-boiled eggs,
one-third of a banana, and green tea.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.307
You're taking instructions from her,
aren't you?

21:49.392 --> 21:50.892
I've always been taking instructions from her.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.186
And you are looking
at nothing out the window.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.980
Listen up. I'm from Nebraska.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.649
I'm not like the rest of you.
I can eat food without fear.

21:57.733 --> 22:00.151
Why did Greek yogurt suddenly become...
Never mind.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.239
Did we overuse the B-roll yesterday?

22:04.323 --> 22:05.657
I didn't think so. Did you?

22:05.741 --> 22:07.325
Just keep an eye on the smoke
and people running.

22:07.410 --> 22:09.995
-Why soft?
-Ryan Guidry on the DC desk

22:10.079 --> 22:13.415
signed off with an affiliate stringer
by telling him to stay safe.

22:13.582 --> 22:17.043
God damn it. He's not in the Sudan!
He's in Beacon Hill!

22:17.169 --> 22:18.253
I agree that it's infuriating.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.088
I don't care if there's a shoulder-mounted,

22:20.172 --> 22:22.716
rocket-propelled grenade launcher
pointed at his face.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.176
I don't want anyone telling anyone
to stay safe.

22:25.261 --> 22:27.762
-Do we have to point out how transparent...
-I will take him off the air

22:27.847 --> 22:30.890
just long enough to pummel him
with a snow shovel.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.351
...who are in peril, so don't touch that dial...

22:33.436 --> 22:35.186
-...head goes back on TV...
-...because suddenly you might,

22:35.271 --> 22:36.855
-you know, blow up.
-...will be, "Stay safe."

22:36.939 --> 22:38.523
-You guys about done?
-Yeah.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.984
Good. You're both idiots. Rundown meeting.

22:43.029 --> 22:44.821
All in all, I think we're doing well.

22:44.905 --> 22:47.240
I'm still trying to figure out
exactly what doing well means.

22:47.324 --> 22:49.534
You know what it means. Let's go.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.209
-Jim.
-The source won't go on record yet,

22:58.294 --> 23:00.879
but from everything she's seen,
she's sure it was a pressure cooker bomb.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.672
If she's sure,
why isn't she going on the record?

23:02.757 --> 23:06.009
And the FBI has a picture of someone
taking video at the finish line

23:06.093 --> 23:08.470
at the time of the explosion,
so they're trying to identify that person.

23:08.554 --> 23:10.555
-Got it. Gary?
-Vigils are planned tonight

23:10.639 --> 23:12.307
at Harvard Memorial Church in Cambridge,

23:12.391 --> 23:14.059
Parkman Bandstand in Boston Common,

23:14.143 --> 23:15.894
and for the little boy
at Garvey Park in Dorchester.

23:15.978 --> 23:18.354
No, I repeat, no interviews with children.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.814
What's the desk schedule?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.567
1:00 and then DC takes
a three-hour block.

23:22.651 --> 23:25.403
Neal, tell us what's going on
with the nocturnal nut brigade.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.364
Somebody's trying to give me
classified government documents.

23:34.705 --> 23:36.498
Somebody asked for my encryption key.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.458
That's not uncommon, is it?

23:38.542 --> 23:40.960
No, but then they asked
for a higher level of encryption.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.921
Less common, but not unprecedented.

23:43.005 --> 23:45.256
-We use a site, CryptoHeaven, which is for...
-Nerds.

23:45.716 --> 23:48.384
Yeah, and he told me
to get an air-gapped computer.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.595
-It's a computer that's...
-Never been connected to the Internet.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.473
There's literally a gap of air between
the computer and the rest of the world.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.725
It's what I imagine the afterlife is like
if you've been good.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.644
Once I do that,
he's gonna give me a flash drive.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.437
How's he gonna get it to you?

24:00.523 --> 24:02.565
I know you guys think I live
in a world of crackpots,

24:02.650 --> 24:04.567
and I'll grant you there's a troubling

24:04.652 --> 24:06.528
normal-to-crackpot ratio
on my end of the field...

24:06.612 --> 24:08.113
How's he gonna get you the flash drive, Neal?

24:08.197 --> 24:10.698
He's gonna tape it inside the tank of a toilet
in a restaurant men's room.

24:11.534 --> 24:12.575
Bull's-eye.

24:12.660 --> 24:14.953
-I think he's real.
-Why?

24:16.038 --> 24:17.372
He's paranoid.

24:17.456 --> 24:18.957
Well, why didn't you say so?

24:19.041 --> 24:22.627
I was skeptical before, but now that I know
your source has a mental illness...

24:22.711 --> 24:25.255
Anything else? Good.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.023
Neal.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.988
Go buy an air-gapped computer.

24:51.699 --> 24:52.866
Thank you.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.126
The homemade bombs are considered

25:03.210 --> 25:06.004
improvised explosive devices, or IEDs.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.464
<i>It's created by inserting materials,</i>

25:08.549 --> 25:11.092
<i>nails, ball bearings, glass,</i>
<i>into a pressure cooker.</i>

25:11.177 --> 25:13.219
- Just to be clear...
- You're coming to the top of the hour.

25:13.304 --> 25:14.512
Let's hand off to John in DC.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.264
It's what you would buy at a Crate & Barrel.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.850
And the fragmentation
of the pressure cooker itself

25:18.934 --> 25:20.852
creates lethal shrapnel when ignited

25:20.936 --> 25:23.605
<i>using a simple electronic device</i>
<i>like a digital watch.</i>

25:23.689 --> 25:26.482
<i>You know what, sir?</i>
<i>I'm sorry, I'd rather not give out the recipe.</i>

25:26.567 --> 25:29.986
<i>Unfortunately, the recipe</i>
<i>and the ingredients are readily available.</i>

25:30.070 --> 25:32.530
<i>Nabil Chatila,</i>
<i>FBI counterterrorism expert.</i>

25:32.781 --> 25:33.865
- Split 'em.
<i>- It's 4:00 in the East</i>

25:33.949 --> 25:36.034
<i>when you'd normally be seeing</i>
<i>"Market Wrap-up" with me,</i>

25:36.118 --> 25:38.286
<i>but we'll send it to Washington</i>
<i>and John Bingham</i>

25:38.370 --> 25:41.080
<i>for more continuing coverage</i>
<i>of the tragedy in Boston.</i>

25:41.165 --> 25:44.083
<i>And I'll let you know</i>
<i>how the markets reacted later tonight. John?</i>

25:44.168 --> 25:45.501
- You're out.
- Thanks, Sloan.

25:48.964 --> 25:51.341
I spoke to a source at B of A,
and he couldn't tell me much,

25:51.425 --> 25:53.384
but he did say
the private equity's from out of town.

25:53.469 --> 25:54.761
Great. Good lead. Good work.

25:54.845 --> 25:56.512
You don't know what I'm talking about, right?

25:56.597 --> 25:57.722
-No.
-My puzzle.

25:57.806 --> 25:59.224
Somebody's buying somebody.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.142
So I made a list
of the out-of-town heavy hitters.

26:01.227 --> 26:03.561
Gary! TGP Capital, Oaktree,

26:03.646 --> 26:06.064
Lone Star Funds, Golden State,
Silver Lake, Sequoia.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.274
-Yeah?
-I have a list of 24 private equity firms

26:08.359 --> 26:12.111
and I'd like to find out if anyone has checked
into a hotel in the last 72 hours.

26:12.196 --> 26:14.489
There are 106,000 hotel rooms in New York.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.449
No, they'll be staying at a high-end hotel.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.743
The Four Seasons, The Carlyle, the Regency,

26:18.827 --> 26:20.536
Ritz-Carlton, Mark, Mercer,

26:20.621 --> 26:22.705
Soho Grand, Gramercy, Peninsula...

26:22.790 --> 26:24.374
Yeah, I'm a little busy with Boston.

26:24.458 --> 26:26.751
I meant, you know how
after a 16 or 18-hour shift,

26:26.835 --> 26:28.002
you like to unwind with a little work?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.420
-The tail numbers.
-What's that?

26:29.505 --> 26:31.089
-They came on a private jet, right?
-Probably.

26:31.173 --> 26:32.590
They either landed at Teterboro
or White Plains.

26:32.675 --> 26:33.675
Follow the tail numbers.

26:35.094 --> 26:36.261
-Decent tip.
-Mmm-hmm.

26:37.888 --> 26:41.057
...with CNN's John King
<i>reporting a few minutes ago</i>

26:41.141 --> 26:43.101
<i>that an arrest has been made.</i>

26:43.185 --> 26:44.602
<i>We have no confirmation of this,</i>

26:44.687 --> 26:46.437
<i>but again, CNN's John King is reporting...</i>

26:46.522 --> 26:48.564
<i>John King's reporting an arrest's been made.</i>

26:48.649 --> 26:50.066
<i>Do we have a second confirmation?</i>

26:50.192 --> 26:51.943
Nobody has a second confirmation.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.696
This man doesn't make a lot of mistakes.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.156
There are more reporters
in the city right now than Celtics fans.

26:57.241 --> 26:59.826
I don't see how they could have made
an arrest without anybody noticing.

27:00.286 --> 27:01.661
Get a second source.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.290
Find out where he's getting this,

27:05.374 --> 27:08.126
'cause somebody's talking to him
who isn't talking to us.

27:14.883 --> 27:15.967
Okay, thank you.

27:16.719 --> 27:17.760
Savannah Capital.

27:17.845 --> 27:19.304
Yeah, you're supposed
to be sleeping right now.

27:19.388 --> 27:20.847
I will, but Savannah Capital's in town.

27:20.931 --> 27:22.307
You want me to put a reporter on this?

27:22.391 --> 27:24.392
-I am a reporter.
-An investigative reporter.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.144
I don't want to take someone
off something important.

27:26.228 --> 27:27.812
I can do this. I get information all the time.

27:27.896 --> 27:29.689
You get information people want you to have.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.274
I'm gonna call my good friend Lionel Barkley,

27:31.358 --> 27:32.650
CEO of Savannah Capital.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.402
And he's not gonna tell you anything, right?

27:35.779 --> 27:38.239
-I wouldn't think so.
-You don't want the CEO.

27:38.324 --> 27:39.907
You want a low-level guy
who wants to impress you

27:39.992 --> 27:41.492
by demonstrating he's in the loop.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.870
-I don't know low-level people.
-You teach.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.913
Isn't it possible
one of your bloodless business students...

27:45.998 --> 27:48.416
Is a low-level analyst at Savannah? Yes, sir.

27:48.542 --> 27:50.126
Jacob Geitfreund.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.836
Sent me an email a few months ago.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.254
He'd been promoted from the mail room.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.881
The result of a proper education.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.841
The $24,000 computer
doesn't hold phone numbers?

27:56.925 --> 27:58.551
<i>Savannah Capital.</i>

27:58.635 --> 28:00.678
-Jacob Geitfreund, please.
<i>-Transferring.</i>

28:00.763 --> 28:02.972
Very good student,
but he likes puns too much.

28:03.057 --> 28:05.558
-Well, praise his blog.
-How do you know he has a blog?

28:05.642 --> 28:08.144
-My phone can google things.
-I don't like puns.

28:08.228 --> 28:10.188
-That wasn't a pun.
-I'm saying in general.

28:10.272 --> 28:11.814
Jacob Geitfreund's office.

28:11.899 --> 28:13.816
Hi, this is Sloan Sabbith calling for Jacob.

28:13.901 --> 28:15.276
<i>Just a moment, please. I'll see if he's in.</i>

28:15.361 --> 28:17.195
Sometimes puns can be punny.

28:17.446 --> 28:19.822
- What'd I just say?
<i>- Professor Sabbith?</i>

28:19.948 --> 28:22.784
Jacob, you don't have to
call me professor anymore. It's Sloan.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.786
<i>-Got it.</i>
-I love your blog.

28:24.870 --> 28:26.329
<i>Well, thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

28:26.413 --> 28:29.040
<i>-I didn't know you read it.</i>
-God, everybody does.

28:29.124 --> 28:32.502
I was thinking about doing
a 30 under 30 package

28:32.586 --> 28:35.046
for top analysts and you'd be perfect for that.

28:35.130 --> 28:36.923
<i>Wow, that sounds great. I've love to, yeah.</i>

28:37.007 --> 28:38.883
<i>-Is that why you're calling?</i>
-Not this time.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.095
Right now I'm calling because your firm is
doing a media deal in town

28:42.179 --> 28:43.971
and I wanted to see
if I could get you on deep background.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.599
<i>Hey, you're the one who told us in class</i>
<i>that one of the perks of teaching</i>

28:46.683 --> 28:48.601
<i>is that you can cultivate</i>
<i>young, unwitting sources.</i>

28:48.685 --> 28:51.145
-And that's you.
<i>-Yeah, I know the deal you're talking about.</i>

28:51.230 --> 28:53.481
<i>I can't talk about it. You know, Sloan...</i>

28:53.565 --> 28:55.983
-Yeah?
<i>-Are you seeing anyone?</i>

28:59.613 --> 29:01.739
-Nope.
<i>-Well, I can tell you it's a big deal.</i>

29:01.824 --> 29:03.282
<i>You're going to be interested.</i>

29:03.367 --> 29:05.785
-How big?
<i>-Well, I guess it's all relative.</i>

29:05.869 --> 29:09.080
Hang on a second. He's using puns.
He's talking about sex right now.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.416
-That wasn't a pun. It was a double enten...
-Thanks for holding.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.251
You mean the size of the deal is relative?

29:13.335 --> 29:14.293
<i>- Sure.</i>

29:14.378 --> 29:15.545
<i>Look, if you want to get together privately</i>

29:15.629 --> 29:18.005
<i>and talk about</i>
<i>the 30 under 30 segment you mentioned...</i>

29:18.674 --> 29:20.842
-What's going on down there?
<i>-Excuse me?</i>

29:20.926 --> 29:22.176
I'm gonna call you back.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.846
Not able to get
<i>any more details at the moment,</i>

29:24.930 --> 29:25.930
<i>but CNN is now retracting</i>

29:26.265 --> 29:27.932
<i>its earlier report</i>

29:28.016 --> 29:29.934
<i>that an arrest had been made in Boston.</i>

29:30.018 --> 29:31.727
-What happened?
-CNN had to retract.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.271
No arrest has been made.

29:33.355 --> 29:36.107
<i>Once again, our own John King...</i>

29:36.191 --> 29:37.942
- Hey!

29:38.026 --> 29:39.277
Hey!

29:40.696 --> 29:42.113
What are you doing?

29:43.782 --> 29:46.492
Worst moment in this guy's life
and you're cheering?

29:46.577 --> 29:47.910
-Why?
-Why?

29:47.995 --> 29:49.579
Because you think if someone gets in line

29:49.663 --> 29:51.247
in back of you, it means the line moved?

29:51.331 --> 29:53.583
-We still blew Genoa.
-The line didn't move.

29:53.667 --> 29:56.294
-And if there's anyone in the world...
-That's right.

29:56.378 --> 29:59.630
...who should be able to empathize with CNN
right now, you would think...

29:59.715 --> 30:01.966
-Wouldn't you?
-...that it would be the people in this room.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.719
-Empathy.
-He got knocked down.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.431
You didn't get taller.

30:09.433 --> 30:11.058
-Sorry, Charlie.
-Sorry.

30:15.063 --> 30:17.356
-Dodged a fucking bullet there.
-No kidding.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.527
The MSG is where
the flavor comes from.

30:21.612 --> 30:24.405
The Chinese are a people
who have been around for billions of years.

30:24.490 --> 30:26.532
No people have been around
for billions of years.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.743
Okay, well, some of us
have read a book called the Bible,

30:28.827 --> 30:31.204
which is pretty clear
about the Chinese and MSG.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.915
--Listen, I will live a life of flavorless food

30:33.999 --> 30:35.374
if that's what it takes to be married to you,

30:35.459 --> 30:36.918
but couldn't you give me a different test?

30:37.002 --> 30:38.753
General knowledge or air hockey?

30:38.837 --> 30:40.922
As soon as the life insurance policy vests.

30:42.090 --> 30:43.841
Hard B-plus for the third day.

30:43.926 --> 30:45.051
I think we're getting our juju back.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.678
-What do you think?
-You ever read Euripides?

30:48.597 --> 30:50.515
Yeah. I read it when I was in...

30:50.599 --> 30:52.725
No, fuck you. I haven't read Euripides.

30:52.809 --> 30:55.686
In the first act of the story,
you chase the heroes up a tree.

30:55.771 --> 30:57.855
In the second act, you throw rocks at them.

30:57.940 --> 31:00.733
And in the third act,
they get themselves down.

31:00.817 --> 31:02.401
I think we're getting ourselves
down from the tree.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.574
-It's Maggie.
-Put her on speaker.

31:09.076 --> 31:10.618
Hey, Maggie. You've got Will here, too.

31:10.702 --> 31:12.328
Listen, I'm at the precinct.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.996
I thought
<i>you were staking out City Hall.</i>

31:14.081 --> 31:15.456
That's where everybody else is.

31:15.582 --> 31:17.208
'Cause that's where
the news is gonna be coming from.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.001
<i>Then I won't have</i>
<i>any trouble hearing about it.</i>

31:19.086 --> 31:22.129
<i>I've been talking with a desk sergeant,</i>
<i>a woman in her early 30s.</i>

31:22.214 --> 31:24.215
She was crying a little and we got to talking

31:24.299 --> 31:26.300
and I think I know
what happened to John King.

31:26.385 --> 31:28.386
That's not really the story we're chasing.

31:28.512 --> 31:31.806
Yeah, but I just thought you should know
in an entirely unrelated incident,

31:31.890 --> 31:34.433
the Boston PD was
disseminating disinformation

31:34.518 --> 31:36.936
to a handful of detectives to try to find a leak.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.479
King's source was one of them.

31:38.689 --> 31:40.273
Why was the desk sergeant crying?

31:40.357 --> 31:42.483
<i>Her detective husband</i>
<i>had just been suspended</i>

31:42.568 --> 31:44.569
<i>pending an investigation into a leak.</i>

31:44.653 --> 31:46.862
-You have a second source?
-I don't even have a first source.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.990
She wouldn't confirm it,
but I'm pretty sure I'm right.

31:49.074 --> 31:50.616
Prove it
<i>and we'll help a brother out.</i>

31:50.701 --> 31:52.743
But I don't like
when the media covers the media.

31:52.828 --> 31:54.495
- Yeah.
- See?

31:55.038 --> 31:57.373
Act one, John King gets chased up a tree.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.500
Act two, everyone throws rocks at him.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.794
I completely understood
the story the first time.

32:04.506 --> 32:07.133
The Boston Police Department
and the US Department of Justice

32:07.217 --> 32:09.427
would like you to know
that this headline is incorrect

32:09.720 --> 32:11.846
<i>and that the two men pictured here</i>
<i>are not suspects</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:13.514
<i>in the Boston Marathon bombing.</i>

32:13.599 --> 32:16.475
And I'll bet the two men pictured here
would really like you to know

32:16.560 --> 32:19.061
that they're not suspects
in the Boston Marathon bombing.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.323
-Yes, sir?
-I'd just like to use your restroom.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.199
The restroom is for our customers.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.285
Can I get some takeout?

32:34.369 --> 32:35.536
Sure, what would you like?

32:35.621 --> 32:37.538
What's the least expensive thing
you have on the menu?

32:39.082 --> 32:40.916
-Go use the restroom.
-Thank you.

33:49.945 --> 33:51.821
Welcome back
<i>to our continued coverage</i>

33:51.947 --> 33:53.364
<i>of the Boston Marathon manhunt.</i>

33:53.448 --> 33:56.659
<i>ACN reporter Elliot Hirsch is in Watertown.</i>
<i>Elliot?</i>

33:56.785 --> 33:59.370
<i>Will, over the last few hours,</i>
<i>a series of dramatic events</i>

33:59.454 --> 34:01.414
<i>have unfolded on the streets</i>
<i>of suburban Boston.</i>

34:01.540 --> 34:04.250
As of this moment,
one police officer at MIT is dead

34:04.334 --> 34:06.669
as is one of the two bombing suspects,

34:06.753 --> 34:09.714
who was killed in a car chase
and a shoot-out with law enforcement.

34:09.798 --> 34:11.340
The other suspect remains at large.

34:16.430 --> 34:18.180
<i>Police units searched door-to-door</i>

34:18.265 --> 34:20.433
<i>over a 20-block area here in Watertown.</i>

34:20.517 --> 34:23.936
<i>The entire city of Boston is on lockdown</i>
<i>as the manhunt continues.</i>

34:24.020 --> 34:26.897
<i>Do we know the circumstances</i>
<i>surrounding the MIT officer's death?</i>

34:26.982 --> 34:28.315
<i>Was there a motive?</i>

34:28.400 --> 34:30.401
The shooting is
<i>still under active investigation,</i>

34:30.485 --> 34:33.988
<i>but we know he was shot</i>
<i>during a confrontation with the two suspects.</i>

34:34.072 --> 34:37.074
<i>Campus surveillance footage</i>
<i>is currently being reviewed as we speak.</i>

34:37.159 --> 34:39.827
<i>What details can you tell us</i>
<i>about the lockdown in effect?</i>

34:39.911 --> 34:41.996
The Boston Police Department
<i>is asking residents</i>

34:42.080 --> 34:44.707
<i>to stay inside and not to answer their doors</i>

34:44.791 --> 34:47.835
<i>unless instructed</i>
<i>by a uniformed police officer.</i>

34:47.919 --> 34:49.795
<i>Public transportation has been suspended</i>

34:49.880 --> 34:53.466
<i>and authorities have told people</i>
<i>at closed stops and stations to go home.</i>

34:53.550 --> 34:55.593
<i>No vehicle traffic is allowed in Watertown</i>

34:55.677 --> 34:58.304
<i>and a no-fly zone is in place over the city.</i>

34:58.388 --> 34:59.972
<i>How many people has this affected?</i>

35:00.056 --> 35:03.934
About 32,000 Watertown residents
<i>and business owners.</i>

35:42.307 --> 35:44.892
Sunil Tripathi was a student at Brown.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.353
He was reported missing about a month ago.

35:47.437 --> 35:48.813
His family set up a Facebook page

35:48.897 --> 35:51.607
for anyone who might have information
about where he is.

35:51.942 --> 35:54.819
Now, yesterday at 5:00 P.M.
in response to Thursday's Post front page

35:54.903 --> 35:58.364
misidentifying two innocent people
as enemies of the state,

35:58.448 --> 36:00.991
the FBI issued these photos
of the actual suspects.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.409
Now, here's what happened next.

36:02.494 --> 36:03.911
Within minutes, users on Reddit...

36:03.995 --> 36:06.497
All got together and decided
that the best thing to do

36:06.581 --> 36:09.333
was to step back
and let the professionals do their jobs.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.252
They began comparing the FBI photo

36:11.336 --> 36:13.504
of one of the suspects to Sunil Tripathi.

36:13.588 --> 36:16.048
By 10:00 P.M.,
it had become a leading theory on Reddit

36:16.132 --> 36:18.175
that Tripathi was suspect number two.

36:18.260 --> 36:21.011
At 2:43 this morning,
a man named Greg Hughes

36:21.096 --> 36:23.180
tweeted that
the Boston Police scanner had identified

36:23.265 --> 36:26.267
the names of the suspects
as Mike Mulugeta and Sunil Tripathi.

36:26.351 --> 36:27.893
Earlier in the night, Greg Hughes had tweeted,

36:27.978 --> 36:31.021
"In 2013, all you need is a connection
to the Boston Police scanner

36:31.106 --> 36:32.690
"and a Twitter feed to know what's up.

36:32.774 --> 36:34.316
"We don't even need TV anymore."

36:34.401 --> 36:36.026
Now he tells me. I just bought a new plasma.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.112
-How big?
-28 inches, baby. The whole ride.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.989
Seven minutes after the Greg Hughes tweet,

36:40.073 --> 36:43.200
Kevin Galliford,
a cameraman for Hartford's CBS affiliate,

36:43.285 --> 36:46.370
picks up on the Hughes tweet and he relays
the same information to his followers.

36:46.454 --> 36:48.539
Moments after that, a reporter at BuzzFeed

36:48.623 --> 36:50.916
sends a tweet out to his 81,000 followers.

36:51.001 --> 36:53.878
A reporter at BuzzFeed has 81,000 followers?

36:53.962 --> 36:55.921
-How many do you have?
-One. Him.

36:56.006 --> 36:57.590
She's funny. I like her jokes.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.384
-I follow you.
-I'm not on Twitter.

37:00.468 --> 37:01.552
-Really?
-Really.

37:01.636 --> 37:03.554
-I wonder who I've been following.
-Guys, please.

37:03.638 --> 37:06.223
The BuzzFeed tweet says,
"Wow, Reddit was right.

37:06.308 --> 37:08.517
"Suspect identified as Sunil Tripathi."

37:08.810 --> 37:10.895
Two questions,
do we know who Greg Hughes is?

37:10.979 --> 37:12.062
He's a guy on Reddit.

37:12.606 --> 37:14.231
Second question is that by this point,

37:14.316 --> 37:17.610
at 2:43 this morning, has anyone
at our network checked on Sunil Tripathi?

37:17.694 --> 37:19.111
- Of course we have.
- And?

37:20.030 --> 37:21.780
Five senior officials with the FBI,

37:21.865 --> 37:24.909
three with the Justice Department, including
one from the Attorney General's office,

37:24.993 --> 37:26.744
another five from the Boston PD,

37:26.828 --> 37:28.913
all of them willing to be
identified on the record,

37:29.039 --> 37:32.458
all of them categorically denying
that Sunil Tripathi is a suspect.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.668
Also the Secretary of Homeland Security.

37:34.753 --> 37:37.421
Uh-huh. When you put their certainty
up against Greg Hughes' certainty,

37:37.505 --> 37:38.756
I don't know who the hell to believe.

37:38.840 --> 37:41.508
2:57 A.M., 14 minutes after the first tweet,

37:41.593 --> 37:45.512
an NBC News correspondent
tweets the Sunil Tripathi theory

37:45.597 --> 37:47.514
to his 180,000 followers.

37:47.599 --> 37:49.350
180,000?

37:49.517 --> 37:50.976
At least it's been downgraded to a theory.

37:51.061 --> 37:53.020
A half hour later, Perez Hilton sends it out.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.022
- I don't even want to know.
- Six million.

37:55.523 --> 37:57.816
The Internet celebrates
that Reddit has solved the bombing.

37:57.901 --> 38:00.736
John King is a stooge.
Uh, The Post is irresponsible.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.696
And the FBI is inept.

38:02.864 --> 38:04.031
- Is that it?
- No.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.034
Between 3:00 A.M. and 4:15 A.M.,

38:07.118 --> 38:09.912
Tripathi's sister receives 58 calls on her cell.

38:09.996 --> 38:12.373
-Maggie's listened to them.
-Really?

38:12.707 --> 38:15.042
About half the messages are reporters

38:15.126 --> 38:17.211
calling for a comment on her missing brother

38:17.295 --> 38:19.171
being named a suspect in the bombing.

38:19.255 --> 38:21.632
The other half are death threats, and of those,

38:21.716 --> 38:23.384
close to two-thirds include rape.

38:23.468 --> 38:25.803
Death threats also start
to fill the Facebook page

38:25.887 --> 38:27.513
-the Tripathis had set up to find...
-Jenna!

38:27.597 --> 38:29.139
- I agree.
- That's why we're telling you this.

38:29.224 --> 38:30.975
Now they've taken down
the page which Reddit users

38:31.059 --> 38:33.602
-saw as evidence of guilt instead of...
-Get me on the air.

38:33.687 --> 38:35.145
-I need a suit.
-It's being cleaned and pressed.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.106
There's a whole room full of suits.
I can wear any one of them.

38:37.190 --> 38:39.191
You're 9 feet tall.
You can't wear any one of them.

38:39.401 --> 38:40.985
I think she's starting to get
the hang of this place.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.736
Saw as evidence of guilt
instead of the hundreds of threats

38:42.821 --> 38:44.613
of public lynchings,
beheadings, and bullets to the head

38:44.698 --> 38:46.824
of family members as well
as the anti-Muslim messages.

38:46.908 --> 38:49.201
-Out of curiosity...
-Are the Tripathis Muslim?

38:49.285 --> 38:50.494
-Yeah.
-No.

38:50.578 --> 38:52.538
Well done, faceless mob.

38:52.622 --> 38:54.039
Let's go.

38:54.124 --> 38:55.541
<i>...was killed early this morning</i>

38:55.625 --> 38:57.418
while the second one remains at large.

38:57.544 --> 38:59.712
Again, the FBI has announced
that the suspects

38:59.796 --> 39:02.381
are the brothers
Tamerlan and Jahar Tsarnaev.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.883
<i>Because we prefer</i>
<i>not to make celebrities out of these men,</i>

39:04.968 --> 39:07.469
we'll be referring to them
on ACN as the suspects.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.179
But right now we want you to know

39:09.264 --> 39:12.975
that no one is a suspect
but Tamerlan and Jahar Tsarnaev.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.643
You're up in six minutes.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.021
-Thanks for the food.
-Sure.

39:17.105 --> 39:18.564
This is great chicken salad.

39:18.648 --> 39:19.940
There's some cookies in the bag, too.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.567
They have walnuts. I'm allergic.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.277
The chicken salad has walnuts.

39:24.446 --> 39:25.571
What are you talking about?

39:25.655 --> 39:28.282
The chicken salad
you're eating right now has walnuts in it.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.035
-These things are walnuts?
-What did you think they were?

39:31.119 --> 39:33.412
I don't... I wasn't thinking what...

39:33.872 --> 39:37.124
When did walnuts start
going into chicken salad?

39:37.208 --> 39:38.959
-Are you gonna be okay?
-No.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.044
Here's what's gonna happen.

39:40.128 --> 39:44.006
In about a minute, my tongue is going to
swell up like a bassoon.

39:44.299 --> 39:46.383
-A bassoon?
-A bassoon.

39:46.468 --> 39:48.385
-A bassoon.
-A balloon.

39:48.470 --> 39:50.387
All right, uh, we have to pull the story.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.848
-No, it's a good thory.
-Not anymore, Elliot.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.892
Do you need an EpiPen or a hospital?

39:54.976 --> 39:56.894
You do it. You do the thory.

39:56.978 --> 39:59.146
-You have the faths.
-The facts?

39:59.230 --> 40:00.230
Yeth.

40:01.608 --> 40:03.358
Look at me. I can't go on camera.

40:04.027 --> 40:06.236
-What, Marie-Antoinette's clothes?
-Leth's go.

40:06.321 --> 40:07.905
-Leth's go.
-Okay, calm down.

40:08.073 --> 40:09.281
Uh...

40:09.908 --> 40:11.950
Makeup, passport.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.120
What emergency does she need these for?

40:15.205 --> 40:16.663
Breaking news at the Met Gala?

40:16.748 --> 40:17.873
I'm calling the thudio.

40:17.957 --> 40:19.958
- I think you should let me do that.
- Hmm?

40:20.043 --> 40:22.002
-Give me the phone.
-Yeah, you got it.

40:57.497 --> 40:59.123
All right, coming to you in 30.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.707
-30?
-30.

41:00.792 --> 41:02.793
-I can't tell...
-30! No S's.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.128
-No S's in 30.
-30.

41:04.212 --> 41:05.838
Well, not anymore.

41:06.756 --> 41:07.840
Maggie?

41:07.924 --> 41:09.591
<i>Uh, yeah, Jim. I can hear you.</i>

41:09.717 --> 41:11.051
This is Jim. Can you hear me?

41:11.261 --> 41:13.178
Yeah, I can. Can you not hear me?

41:13.263 --> 41:16.014
Yes, yeah. You were one question ahead.
Here's Mac.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.686
If you get a stain on the dress,
club soda and salt,

41:20.770 --> 41:21.895
but it has to be right away

41:21.980 --> 41:24.314
and you have to tell the dry cleaner
that under no circumstance...

41:24.399 --> 41:26.567
You know what? Let's do this after.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.318
-You think?
-Stand by.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.697
Intro and then take us to Boston.

41:32.907 --> 41:34.867
<i>Contact authorities immediately.</i>

41:34.951 --> 41:37.828
FBI spokesperson Angela Brand, thank you.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.330
Earlier today, ACN producer Maggie Jordan

41:40.415 --> 41:44.001
<i>was able to track down a former wrestling</i>
<i>teammate of the second suspect.</i>

41:44.085 --> 41:46.420
<i>The young man was not willing</i>
<i>to go in front of our cameras,</i>

41:46.504 --> 41:48.672
<i>nor was he willing to let us reveal his name,</i>

41:48.756 --> 41:51.049
<i>but ACN's confirmed his authenticity</i>

41:51.134 --> 41:54.011
<i>and Maggie Jordan is standing by</i>
<i>in Boston for this report.</i>

41:54.095 --> 41:55.220
<i>Maggie?</i>

41:56.222 --> 41:58.182
<i>Will, earlier today, we were able to find</i>

41:58.266 --> 42:00.392
<i>a 20-year-old man whom we'll call Joe,</i>

42:00.476 --> 42:03.437
<i>but as you mentioned in your intro,</i>
<i>that's not his real name.</i>

42:03.855 --> 42:06.523
<i>We found him by going through</i>
<i>a series of Facebook friends</i>

42:06.608 --> 42:09.067
<i>and confirmed his identity</i>
<i>and his connection to the suspects</i>

42:09.152 --> 42:10.611
<i>using his driver's license,</i>

42:10.695 --> 42:13.071
<i>high school photos</i>
<i>from Cambridge Rindge and Latin,</i>

42:13.156 --> 42:15.282
<i>and sources inside</i>
<i>the State Board of Education.</i>

42:15.742 --> 42:17.951
How did Joe describe the second suspect?

42:18.036 --> 42:19.870
<i>"A super chill guy.</i>

42:19.954 --> 42:22.456
<i>"Liked soccer, hip-hop, and girls.</i>

42:22.540 --> 42:24.833
"He obsessed over The Walking Dead
and Game of Thrones."

42:24.918 --> 42:26.418
That sounds like a lot of people.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.629
<i>It does, but here's the part that separates him.</i>

42:28.838 --> 42:32.174
<i>Joe said, "He thought 9/11 was justified</i>

42:32.300 --> 42:34.176
<i>"because of what the US does</i>
<i>in other countries</i>

42:34.302 --> 42:37.763
<i>"and that they do it so frequently,</i>
<i>dropping bombs all the time."</i>

42:37.847 --> 42:40.515
<i>I want to be clear,</i>
<i>I'm quoting Joe, not the suspect.</i>

42:40.600 --> 42:42.142
<i>It was a second-party characterization.</i>

42:43.436 --> 42:45.812
ACN's Maggie Jordan reporting from Boston.

42:45.897 --> 42:49.399
<i>When we come back, more coverage</i>
<i>from the Boston bombing investigation.</i>

42:50.652 --> 42:51.735
Clear.

42:52.654 --> 42:55.405
Yeth. Yeth! Yeth!

42:55.490 --> 42:57.324
-He's saying "yes."
-I know.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.743
...two male suspects
<i>they are seeking</i>

42:59.827 --> 43:01.578
<i>in conjunction with the bombing.</i>

43:01.663 --> 43:04.539
<i>They have not been apprehended at this time.</i>

43:05.208 --> 43:07.751
Is it just me,
or did she age 10 years this week?

43:08.544 --> 43:09.836
I, um...

43:11.506 --> 43:13.173
Yeah.

43:27.272 --> 43:28.480
Hey.

43:28.564 --> 43:30.315
What are you doing out here?

43:30.400 --> 43:31.650
It's a nice night.

43:32.527 --> 43:33.527
What do you want to talk about?

43:34.529 --> 43:36.280
I thought you guys did great this week.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.949
My head's held high. It's a good feeling.

43:39.993 --> 43:42.119
-I've seen the numbers.
-I haven't.

43:45.540 --> 43:46.790
Did we drop to third?

43:48.167 --> 43:49.209
Fourth.

43:51.045 --> 43:52.129
Fourth?

43:56.050 --> 43:57.718
Fourth. Hmm.

43:59.846 --> 44:01.722
I've always been able to live with second.

44:01.806 --> 44:04.599
I mean, I get that.
Our motto around here is go for the silver.

44:04.684 --> 44:06.393
But fourth?

44:06.477 --> 44:09.980
We did everything right.
We did everything right.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.399
You think because we went up late...

44:12.483 --> 44:14.651
Look, I didn't ask you to come out here
to berate you about numbers.

44:14.736 --> 44:17.362
Those days are over.
I want you to do the news well.

44:17.739 --> 44:20.449
But your power comes from your ratings.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.826
And the autonomy of the news division
comes from your power.

44:22.910 --> 44:24.369
You're not gonna be able
to do the stories you want.

44:24.454 --> 44:26.121
You're not gonna be able
to say whatever you want.

44:26.205 --> 44:28.957
And, frankly,
you're not gonna be able to stay on the air

44:29.042 --> 44:31.710
because my mother and I
can only protect you from the board

44:31.794 --> 44:34.087
if you're making money.

44:40.803 --> 44:43.263
Well, I think it's time for me to quit.

45:05.119 --> 45:07.704
Let's do sports, Charlie. We love sports.

45:09.457 --> 45:10.874
- You mean, like, try out for a team?

45:10.958 --> 45:12.918
Do not mean try out for a team, no.

45:13.002 --> 45:15.337
-Excuse me.
-Neal.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.299
-What do you need?
-I need to talk to the two of you.

45:19.384 --> 45:20.967
I can't find Jim or Mac or Don.

45:21.344 --> 45:22.469
Go ahead.

45:23.679 --> 45:25.055
Is it all right in front of...

45:25.139 --> 45:26.264
Yeah, what is it?

45:29.560 --> 45:30.644
I'm currently in possession of

45:30.728 --> 45:33.688
a little more than
27,000 stolen government documents.

45:33.773 --> 45:35.190
About half of them classified.

45:37.652 --> 45:39.986
Yeah, I'm just gonna jump off this railing.

45:40.071 --> 45:43.073
You'll have experts authenticate them,
but they're authentic. This isn't Genoa.

45:43.157 --> 45:45.242
-What's in the documents?
-Hang on.

45:45.326 --> 45:48.161
It's Will. Have Mac come out to the terrace.
Go ahead.

45:48.788 --> 45:51.123
There's a PR firm in Virginia called BCD.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.749
They do contract work for SOCOM.

45:53.000 --> 45:54.918
-Propaganda?
-Hearts and minds, yeah.

45:55.002 --> 45:56.253
They get stories in foreign newspapers

45:56.337 --> 45:58.255
about American soldiers
doing community outreach.

45:58.339 --> 46:00.090
But it can go higher than that.

46:00.174 --> 46:02.551
They're helping King Abdullah
stay in power in Jordan.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.511
And it can also be disinformation.

46:05.221 --> 46:07.472
A growing pro-democracy rebellion in Kundu

46:07.557 --> 46:10.350
threatens stability in a region
that includes American interests,

46:10.435 --> 46:12.227
including national security.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.772
To undermine the movement,
BCD put false stories in the local press

46:15.857 --> 46:18.483
claiming that a rebel leader
was about to wage war

46:18.568 --> 46:20.485
on another rebel group.

46:20.570 --> 46:22.821
Those false stories caused riots last week

46:22.905 --> 46:25.449
that killed 38 people
including three Americans.

46:31.706 --> 46:33.206
Start at the beginning.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.266
- Start again.
- I've told the story three times.

46:51.350 --> 46:52.476
Tell it again.

46:54.061 --> 46:56.605
I'm contacted over our website
by someone who wants my encryption key.

46:56.689 --> 46:58.273
-I give it to him.
-How do you know it's a he?

46:58.357 --> 47:00.484
I don't. I'm using the generic term
for an unknown person.

47:00.568 --> 47:02.986
I give it to him. He tells me he wants
a higher level of encryption

47:03.070 --> 47:04.863
and that I should assume my adversary

47:04.947 --> 47:07.532
is capable of three trillion guesses
per second.

47:07.617 --> 47:09.701
I get him the higher encryption
and he tells me

47:09.785 --> 47:11.495
he's gonna hide a flash drive
for me at a restaurant

47:11.579 --> 47:14.664
and that I need to get an air-gapped computer
to view the flash drive.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.500
I view some of the contents of the flash drive,

47:16.584 --> 47:18.752
but obviously not all
because there are 27,000 documents.

47:18.961 --> 47:22.672
I'm convinced
by the little I've read to tell him or her

47:22.757 --> 47:25.300
that to convince my bosses right away
I'm gonna need more

47:25.384 --> 47:29.638
or something else and I remind him,
them, about Genoa.

47:29.847 --> 47:31.515
Now, you should know that the DOD

47:31.599 --> 47:33.642
doesn't store documents
on the same Internet you and I use.

47:33.726 --> 47:36.019
They use a private network known as SIPRNet.

47:36.103 --> 47:38.396
Secret Internet Protocol Router Network.

47:38.481 --> 47:40.690
At first, he, the source,

47:40.775 --> 47:42.567
has trouble transferring them from SIPRNet,

47:42.652 --> 47:45.111
so I tell him to try using a CD-R and then...

47:45.196 --> 47:47.781
Stop. You left out that part before.

47:48.366 --> 47:50.867
-What part?
-Where you asked for more documents.

47:50.952 --> 47:52.869
It's a lot of computerese that doesn't matter.

47:52.954 --> 47:54.371
I didn't want your eyes to glaze over.

47:54.455 --> 47:56.540
I wanted one or two pieces I could show you

47:56.624 --> 47:57.958
so you'd okay the cost of investigating.

47:58.042 --> 48:00.126
Did he give them to you,
the one or two pieces?

48:01.170 --> 48:02.254
Yes.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.010
Neal, you induced him to commit a felony.

48:09.720 --> 48:12.389
You conspired to commit espionage.

48:14.100 --> 48:16.518
We were supposed
to end the week down three to five points.

48:16.602 --> 48:18.144
According to who?

48:18.229 --> 48:19.437
Me.

48:21.440 --> 48:24.109
We missed the quarterly targets and by a lot,

48:24.193 --> 48:26.611
but ended trading up one and three...

48:37.373 --> 48:38.915
It was a pun.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.167
"It's all relative."

48:41.460 --> 48:44.421
It wasn't a double entendre, it was a pun.

48:49.343 --> 48:51.177
Should I just stay here?

48:54.682 --> 48:55.724
No.

48:55.850 --> 48:58.560
The moment you asked him
to give you stolen classified documents,

48:58.644 --> 49:01.104
you committed a federal crime.

49:01.188 --> 49:02.731
You don't have to scare him.
They're not gonna want him.

49:02.815 --> 49:04.107
They're gonna want the whistle-blower.

49:04.191 --> 49:06.359
How do you think
they're gonna get to the whistle-blower?

49:06.444 --> 49:08.445
What is everybody doing out? Reese.

49:08.529 --> 49:11.531
-We're kind of in the middle of something.
-When's their birthday, the twins?

49:11.616 --> 49:13.783
-Why don't we meet in my office?
-When's their birthday?

49:13.868 --> 49:16.703
-The party's tomorrow night.
-Not the party. Their actual birthday.

49:16.829 --> 49:17.871
When do they turn 25?

49:17.955 --> 49:20.290
I honestly don't... Next week, the 25th or 26th.

49:20.374 --> 49:23.168
Get your mother on the phone. She has
to call the board into an emergency session.

49:23.252 --> 49:24.753
-Right now, tonight.
-What are you talking about?

49:24.837 --> 49:26.755
You went to Wharton, Reese.
Wake the fuck up.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.548
You're in the middle of a hostile takeover.

49:29.342 --> 49:31.676
-What?
-Somebody's trying to buy this company.

49:32.345 --> 49:34.512
They got him.
Jahar Tsarnaev is hiding in a boat

49:34.597 --> 49:36.640
on a trailer
in the backyard of a house in Watertown.

49:36.724 --> 49:39.059
SWAT teams are there
along with surprisingly heavy artillery

49:39.143 --> 49:40.894
for a metropolitan police department.
He is surrounded.

49:40.978 --> 49:42.395
Okay, I'm going out there.

49:42.480 --> 49:44.689
But, Mac, you should know
that a few minutes ago, I quit.

49:45.232 --> 49:47.442
I'm gonna do sports or perhaps nothing,

49:47.526 --> 49:49.110
because somehow
in regaining our credibility,

49:49.195 --> 49:51.071
we went from second to fourth place.

49:52.281 --> 49:54.532
By the way, Euripides can suck it.

49:54.617 --> 49:56.493
Chase the heroes up a tree,
throw rocks at them,

49:56.577 --> 49:58.161
and then get them down?
When does that happen?

49:58.245 --> 49:59.329
That was supposed to be this week.

49:59.413 --> 50:02.082
We were supposed
to get down from the tree this week.

50:03.417 --> 50:06.586
He's hiding in a boat in someone's backyard?

50:07.254 --> 50:11.466
I'd like confirmation on that
before I say it on TV!

50:32.780 --> 50:35.198
I'm not spending the rest
of my career in a tree.

50:35.282 --> 50:37.575
I have to be somebody's husband. Hers.

50:43.666 --> 50:45.542
You know who did great this week?

50:45.626 --> 50:47.001
The police.

50:47.086 --> 50:49.546
The FBI. The DOJ. Homeland Security.

50:49.630 --> 50:52.465
In less than 100 hours,
they found two needles in a haystack

50:52.550 --> 50:53.550
the size of the world.

50:53.634 --> 50:55.969
You know who sucked? Everybody else.

50:57.012 --> 50:59.723
Two times in 24 hours,
law enforcement officials

50:59.807 --> 51:03.143
had to publically disclose information
before they wanted to

51:03.227 --> 51:07.355
because either a paper or website
put someone's life in danger.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.899
So I'm not so easily surrendering

51:09.984 --> 51:13.737
to citizen journalists or citizen detectives.

51:14.947 --> 51:16.573
Neal needs a lawyer.

51:16.657 --> 51:18.158
Get Rebecca Halliday on the phone

51:18.242 --> 51:19.409
'cause he's in very serious trouble.

51:20.494 --> 51:22.620
We're gonna do a good show
people watch, Reese.

51:22.705 --> 51:25.373
If you have our back, then we're not gonna
let you get shot in yours.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.584
And apparently, we're all up for sale.

51:30.004 --> 51:31.296
You were wrong.

51:32.506 --> 51:34.841
We're not in the middle of the third act.

51:34.925 --> 51:36.885
We just got to the end of the first.
