<i>In college,
you get so close to your crew</i>

00:20.016 --> 00:22.413
<i>that it feels like there are
no boundaries whatsoever...</i>

00:24.713 --> 00:26.817
<i>You share food...</i>

00:27.966 --> 00:29.901
<i>...drinks...</i>

00:30.887 --> 00:33.023
<i>...and hopefully not mono.</i>

00:33.055 --> 00:36.259
<i>But best of all, you share experiences.</i>

00:36.292 --> 00:38.628
<i>And on this day, my friends
and I were gonna share</i>

00:38.661 --> 00:41.876
<i>Luca's big art debut
at the Cal U Arts Fest.</i>

00:47.469 --> 00:49.171
Ooh! There's the artist, right there.

00:49.204 --> 00:50.973
Hey, Luca!

00:51.006 --> 00:53.009
Hi.

00:53.042 --> 00:55.812
Hey. Hi.

00:55.844 --> 00:57.981
Yep, that's m'dude.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.283
He should've had his own tent,
but next year.

01:00.316 --> 01:02.819
A wall is fine for now.

01:02.852 --> 01:04.654
<i>The thing about having no boundaries,</i>

01:04.686 --> 01:06.222
<i>and sharing so much...</i>

01:09.893 --> 01:11.493
<i>...is that it's all the more shocking</i>

01:11.527 --> 01:14.564
<i>when someone is still able
to cross the line.</i>

01:14.596 --> 01:18.000
Damn, Zoey, I didn't know
you had it in you.

01:19.034 --> 01:20.369
I don't.

01:22.405 --> 01:25.341

02:05.047 --> 02:08.017
Look, whoever that is, she's hideous.
She has nothing on you.

02:08.050 --> 02:10.538
"A", there's no way of telling
what she actually looks like.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.150
And "B", legit a second ago

02:12.180 --> 02:14.107
you thought that hideous girl <i> was</i> me.

02:14.132 --> 02:15.090
I did.

02:15.115 --> 02:16.404
- I-I got this.
- Go.

02:16.429 --> 02:17.936
- Okay, Zo, you know what?
- Yeah?

02:17.961 --> 02:20.354
It's probably just a favor
for some relative...

02:20.386 --> 02:22.022
- Mm-hmm.
- ...who's an aspiring influencer.

02:22.039 --> 02:23.140
I bet you it's his cousin.

02:23.174 --> 02:24.977
Luca.

02:25.009 --> 02:26.690
Is this your cousin?

02:26.715 --> 02:28.605
Huh? N... No, no.
That's my ex-girlfriend.

02:28.630 --> 02:30.519
Okay, well, I tried.

02:33.955 --> 02:36.691
Hey. What? I was just admiring
the composition.

02:36.724 --> 02:39.694
'Cause this body, when looking
at it, is very well-composed...

02:39.728 --> 02:42.531
- Mm. Mnh-mnh.
- ...I'd say.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.599
- Is there something wrong?
- Hm?

02:44.633 --> 02:46.402
Hm?

02:46.435 --> 02:48.437
You know what? There's a lot
of other stuff to go see.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.906
I'm gonna go check out the queer
performance art at Titanium.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.608
- Hard pass for me.
- Oh.

02:52.640 --> 02:53.975
You actually weren't invited.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.544
This is about me exploring
my own community

02:56.578 --> 02:58.113
without your privileged, cisgendered,

02:58.145 --> 03:00.081
heteronormative gaze.

03:00.115 --> 03:02.651
Geez, you are really shot-gunning

03:02.683 --> 03:04.453
Professor Hewson's Kool-Aid.

03:04.485 --> 03:05.721
She's my gay guru.

03:05.753 --> 03:07.588
My gay-ru.

03:07.621 --> 03:09.123
I have no idea what you people
are saying.

03:09.157 --> 03:11.293
Here, let me translate
for you. M'byeeeee!

03:11.325 --> 03:13.495
I still don't know.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.997
We are gonna go, too.

03:16.031 --> 03:18.099
- Mm-hmm.
- Bye, Zoey.

03:18.133 --> 03:19.730
Do you wanna... You don't
want to see any more...

03:19.755 --> 03:21.106
Update me every five minutes.

03:21.131 --> 03:22.066
Okay.

03:26.803 --> 03:29.139
Really nice art, Luca.

03:29.172 --> 03:31.875
Word? 'Cause I'm kind of
feeling the vibe that...

03:31.907 --> 03:34.043
Oh, no, it's really,
really nice. Really moving.

03:34.077 --> 03:36.645
It really fricking moved
all my friends out of the tent.

03:36.679 --> 03:37.848
There it is.

03:37.881 --> 03:39.483
I'm just feeling really stupid
right now, Luca.

03:39.516 --> 03:41.184
Not in the kind of like,
"Oh, God, I mispronounced

03:41.216 --> 03:43.119
'expresso' again" kind of stupid.

03:43.153 --> 03:44.154
You'll find it.

03:44.186 --> 03:45.488
Everybody came out to support you

03:45.522 --> 03:47.362
because I told them
it meant a lot to me.

03:47.387 --> 03:49.491
And you weren't even gonna
give me a courtesy heads up

03:49.523 --> 03:52.393
that your art is
a half-naked ex-girlfriend?

03:52.427 --> 03:54.229
I mean, key word being "art."

03:54.261 --> 03:57.199
Look, you're on the board, too.

03:57.231 --> 04:00.034
Oh, great. I'm a masterpiece.

04:00.068 --> 04:01.636
Anyway, who is this ex,

04:01.668 --> 04:03.237
and how come I have never heard of her?

04:03.271 --> 04:05.040
Two places I never visit...

04:05.072 --> 04:07.909
that's Bora Bora during
the rainy season and my past.

04:07.941 --> 04:10.312
Sure. Who wants to take
an umbrella onto a plane?

04:10.344 --> 04:13.013
But your past is very presently
right in my face

04:13.047 --> 04:16.750
wearing a very sheer, lacy bralette.

04:16.783 --> 04:20.254
Okay. Well, this is Juliette,
my ex-girlfriend.

04:20.286 --> 04:21.255
She means nothing.

04:21.288 --> 04:23.257
You're Zoey, my present girlfriend,

04:23.290 --> 04:24.759
and you mean everything.

04:33.468 --> 04:36.237
You're right. I do.

04:36.271 --> 04:38.672
But anyway,
what's your stand on hot dogs?

04:38.706 --> 04:42.076
Do you find them, like,
appetizers, or finger foods?

04:42.110 --> 04:43.410
Do you call them a sandwich?
Not a sandwich?

04:43.444 --> 04:45.045
It is a piece of meat between two buns.

04:45.078 --> 04:46.581
All right. Dude, enough
with the hot dogs, okay?

04:46.614 --> 04:48.450
I'm sorry I've been avoiding you lately.

04:48.482 --> 04:50.684
It's just that when Luca
caught us, it freaked me out.

04:50.718 --> 04:52.287
That could have been Zoey,

04:52.319 --> 04:53.954
and you know that would've
been a nightmare.

04:53.987 --> 04:55.589
So, I just figured it would
just be best to just stop

04:55.622 --> 04:57.425
before anything big happens...

04:57.458 --> 04:59.094
you know, b-beyond us making out.

04:59.126 --> 05:01.463
Yes, I get it. I get it, okay?

05:01.496 --> 05:03.965
We're good.
We're just friends who made out.

05:03.997 --> 05:05.533
No big deal.

05:05.566 --> 05:06.801
- Right.
- Right.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.870
So, let's get some food, as friends.

05:09.903 --> 05:10.971
Hot dogs?

05:10.996 --> 05:12.574
Yeah, yeah. 'Cause friends...
friends eat.

05:12.607 --> 05:14.275
Friends eat. Pals eat. Buddies eat.

05:14.309 --> 05:17.041
- Friends eat all the time.
- Let's do it, friend.

05:22.984 --> 05:24.386
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:24.419 --> 05:26.888
Pronoun pin?

05:26.920 --> 05:28.456
Is that... Do people have them on?

05:28.489 --> 05:30.425
It's a way to let everyone
know your gender identity

05:30.458 --> 05:32.794
without having to say it
every five seconds.

05:32.826 --> 05:35.497
Plus, we love swag.

05:35.530 --> 05:37.399
We/us sure do!

05:37.432 --> 05:39.333
That was stupid. Ugh.

05:39.367 --> 05:41.503
Sorry. I-It's my first time.

05:55.148 --> 05:59.353
Most, if not all, of you here
have a coming-out story.

05:59.386 --> 06:02.990
Some share it in film, some in poetry.

06:03.023 --> 06:06.494
I'd like to share my experience
in a song.

06:18.405 --> 06:21.042
<i>They say life imitates art,</i>

06:21.074 --> 06:23.344
<i>but have you ever seen a piece of art</i>

06:23.377 --> 06:26.314
<i>that seems to just straight up
imitate the shit out of you?</i>

06:58.578 --> 07:03.251
You know what? Juliette's pretty
hot... for a hideous person.

07:03.283 --> 07:06.487
And if he is inspired by her
as an artist,

07:06.521 --> 07:07.888
I guess I shouldn't be mad.

07:07.922 --> 07:10.325
If anything, I should be supportive.

07:10.357 --> 07:12.994
Yeah, I'm sure she means nothing.

07:40.655 --> 07:42.457
Hold up.

07:42.489 --> 07:44.458
If she means nothing,
then why does my boyfriend

07:44.492 --> 07:48.530
have the same permanent nothing
on his body?

07:49.629 --> 07:52.181
It's time to call Ana. Time to dive.

07:54.255 --> 07:57.173
<i>So, Luca wanted me to respect
his boundaries,</i>

07:57.206 --> 08:00.059
<i>but that tattoo really
pushed me past</i> mine.

08:02.223 --> 08:04.979
Oh, my gosh. It's Zoey. We've been made.

08:05.011 --> 08:07.449
"Made"? Are... Will you
answer the phone, maniac?

08:07.482 --> 08:09.551
We are ordering gourmet hot dogs, okay,

08:09.583 --> 08:11.285
not going "toes to nose" on the table.

08:11.319 --> 08:13.655
- Hey.
- The deep dive is on.

08:13.687 --> 08:16.457
I need to know everything
about that Juliette character.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.258
Where she lives, her next of kin,

08:18.292 --> 08:20.494
how she and Luca started dating,
and why it ended.

08:20.528 --> 08:21.896
All right, all right, um, let me just

08:21.929 --> 08:24.299
switch over to hands-free
real quick, okay?

08:25.800 --> 08:27.968
First, you get your little
skinny ass on Instagram.

08:28.001 --> 08:29.270
Do they still follow each other?

08:29.303 --> 08:30.972
Unh-unh. I said "no relish."

08:31.005 --> 08:33.073
And don't let me see you
scrape it off, boo-boo.

08:33.107 --> 08:35.477
Next, you've got to find out,
do they like each other's posts?

08:35.510 --> 08:38.679
Do they comment? Do they like
each other's comments?

08:38.712 --> 08:40.515
You check that slut's Insta story,

08:40.548 --> 08:42.417
but stay on each clip
for less than three seconds,

08:42.448 --> 08:43.650
or she'll see that you viewed it.

08:43.683 --> 08:45.487
If you think you can't handle it,
use my burner account.

08:45.520 --> 08:47.521
It's Mrsworldwide2016.

08:47.554 --> 08:48.989
Hello?

08:49.022 --> 08:50.591
<i>Hello? Are you still there?</i>

08:50.625 --> 08:53.428
Yeah, yeah. No, um, it's just a lot.

08:53.460 --> 08:54.761
I know, baby girl.

08:54.795 --> 08:56.664
And it's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

08:56.697 --> 08:59.601
Because after Instagram, you
check Google, you check Twitter,

08:59.633 --> 09:01.268
you check Snapchat,

09:01.301 --> 09:03.203
and if you're up for it,
you check Venmo.

09:03.237 --> 09:04.212
Venmo?

09:04.237 --> 09:06.174
If they're splitting costs,
you're splitting up.

09:06.207 --> 09:07.475
Right.

09:07.507 --> 09:09.511
Good luck, Zoey. Get to work.

09:09.544 --> 09:10.879
I'll keep you posted.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.816
- Don't be weird. Get me a napkin.
- Okay.

09:15.849 --> 09:17.484
<i>So, like a good student,</i>

09:17.517 --> 09:19.620
<i>I was gonna follow
Ana's advice to the letter.</i>

09:19.654 --> 09:21.956
<i>The deep dive was officially on.</i>

09:21.988 --> 09:25.660
<i>Start by searching for who Luca follows.</i>

09:25.693 --> 09:27.728
Here we go.

09:31.766 --> 09:34.702
<i>Be efficient.
Cover all possible spellings.</i>

09:36.503 --> 09:38.138
Okay, there's two of them.

09:38.171 --> 09:40.374
A white one with a private page.

09:40.407 --> 09:42.342
Get over yourself, White Juliette.

09:42.376 --> 09:43.678
The other one is...

09:43.710 --> 09:45.512
This is her. Found her.

09:47.781 --> 09:50.350
Damn. He still follows her.

09:50.383 --> 09:53.320
<i>Figure out when they were last
publicly seen together.</i>

09:53.353 --> 09:56.590
<i>That's going to be around
the time when they broke up.</i>

10:04.365 --> 10:06.100
<i>Now that you've figured out
when they broke up,</i>

10:06.132 --> 10:07.401
<i>you need to slow down</i>

10:07.434 --> 10:10.170
<i>and inspect every photo post-breakup</i>

10:10.203 --> 10:12.540
<i>to see if there's any level
of communication.</i>

10:12.573 --> 10:14.242
<i>This is where the real work begins.</i>

10:26.786 --> 10:28.889
Sorry, Mom and Dad!

10:28.923 --> 10:32.059
Sorry I couldn't be
your perfect little princess!

10:39.000 --> 10:40.969
- Bye.
- Thank you.

10:41.001 --> 10:42.469
It does get better.

10:42.502 --> 10:44.472
- It does?
- Oh, not today.

10:44.505 --> 10:47.375
But, you know, life.

10:47.407 --> 10:49.142
Right.

10:52.479 --> 10:53.614
Okay, so, just out of curiosity,

10:53.647 --> 10:56.817
did you ever try that
stalker-y mess with me?

10:56.851 --> 10:59.621
Don't flatter yourself. No.

10:59.654 --> 11:01.823
Okay, good, 'cause it's
a little... a little crazy.

11:01.856 --> 11:05.159
Okay, hey, girls only get "crazy"

11:05.192 --> 11:06.828
because guys never offer up

11:06.861 --> 11:08.596
any real information about their past.

11:08.628 --> 11:09.830
Well, if two people are into each other,

11:09.863 --> 11:11.165
shouldn't that be enough?

11:11.198 --> 11:12.733
That's not how women work.

11:12.766 --> 11:16.170
Okay. Well, then, why don't you, uh...

11:16.203 --> 11:22.076
school me on the ways
of a woman, Miss Torres?

11:22.108 --> 11:23.644
Hm?

11:23.678 --> 11:25.679
- Uh, thank you.
- All right. You're welcome.

11:25.713 --> 11:27.848
Thank you. Well, all I'm saying is,

11:27.881 --> 11:29.416
a woman deserves to know the backstory

11:29.449 --> 11:31.652
of all of your patterns...
you know, the... the cheating,

11:31.685 --> 11:33.820
the ghosting, the gym selfies...

11:33.853 --> 11:37.492
so we know how much to be invested.

11:37.525 --> 11:39.360
I disagree.
I think that it's my business.

11:39.392 --> 11:40.994
Okay, but if I'm thinking
about being with you,

11:41.027 --> 11:42.863
then, technically,
it's my business, too.

11:42.896 --> 11:44.699
Oh. So, you're thinking
about being with me?

11:44.732 --> 11:46.601
- Oh. Wow. See? Okay.
- What?

11:46.633 --> 11:48.435
This is why we won't work.
Because I'm actually trying

11:48.468 --> 11:49.703
to have a serious conversation with you,

11:49.737 --> 11:51.506
and you're sitting over here
just acting like a dummy.

11:51.539 --> 11:52.874
Just because I don't think that

11:52.906 --> 11:55.442
you have the right to stalk
my past makes me a dummy?

11:55.476 --> 11:58.380
No, it's just... it's... it's
you that makes you a dummy.

11:59.713 --> 12:02.150
Okay. What's happening?

12:02.183 --> 12:03.785
I'm... I'm missing something.

12:05.852 --> 12:08.021
Honestly.

12:08.054 --> 12:09.391
Is it the hot dogs?

12:12.593 --> 12:15.630
I followed Ana's deep-dive
instructions meticulously.

12:15.663 --> 12:17.131
I hit every major outlet...

12:17.164 --> 12:18.833
I mean, I even sank to Facebook,

12:18.866 --> 12:20.034
where I temporarily
fell down a rabbit hole

12:20.067 --> 12:21.803
of Juliette's parents' page.

12:21.835 --> 12:23.403
But it wasn't a total loss

12:23.436 --> 12:26.373
because it gave me
some much-needed context.

12:26.406 --> 12:29.843
For example, this may seem like
an average photo of Luca

12:29.876 --> 12:31.011
holding a little slice of heaven.

12:31.045 --> 12:33.080
But thanks to my deep dive,

12:33.113 --> 12:36.850
I know that this is actually
Juliette's parents' dog, Xavier,

12:36.883 --> 12:39.720
who nearly perished
in a tragic gazebo fire.

12:39.753 --> 12:41.588
#xavierstrong.

12:41.622 --> 12:44.058
Luca thought I wasn't gonna find this...

12:48.963 --> 12:51.199
I accidentally liked it.

12:51.232 --> 12:53.201
I flew too close to the sun.

12:53.233 --> 12:55.569
You know what? I'll just unlike it.

12:55.602 --> 12:57.838
Simple. Simple. Wait.

12:57.872 --> 13:00.842
Will it be weird if he gets
a notification that it's liked,

13:00.875 --> 13:03.244
and then goes back to check
and sees that it's unliked?

13:03.276 --> 13:04.612
"Black Mirror." You know what?

13:04.645 --> 13:05.747
I'm just gonna like the photo again.

13:05.780 --> 13:08.348
That's not weird, right?

13:08.381 --> 13:09.382
Right?!

13:09.415 --> 13:11.919
I'm gonna do it anyway.

13:11.952 --> 13:13.855
<i>Well, now it only
makes sense for me to go back</i>

13:13.887 --> 13:17.858
<i>and like every single photo of
his I can find, right? Right?!</i>

13:17.891 --> 13:19.926
How's it going out there?

13:19.959 --> 13:21.394
Oh, everything's fine and cool.

13:21.428 --> 13:23.598
I was just taking
a casual art break, babe.

13:23.631 --> 13:24.966
Oh.

13:24.998 --> 13:26.700
And, uh, how's the cyber-stalking?

13:30.436 --> 13:34.274
Well...

13:34.308 --> 13:36.077
you have a matching tattoo with your ex.

13:36.109 --> 13:37.778
And you still communicate.

13:37.811 --> 13:39.279
You liked a photo of Xavier.

13:39.313 --> 13:41.149
Zoey, I'm cool with all my exes
and their pets.

13:41.181 --> 13:43.316
Well, how many exes have there been?

13:43.349 --> 13:45.786
- Nah, bro. I'm not doing this.
- Mm. No, we are doing this.

13:45.819 --> 13:47.454
Because otherwise, how many more times

13:47.487 --> 13:48.823
am I gonna have to go searching?

13:48.856 --> 13:51.958
Is there a Juliette for each
and every tattoo on your body?

13:51.992 --> 13:53.995
I want to know.
I want to know everything.

13:54.027 --> 13:55.929
I mean, what do y... What
do you really want from me,

13:55.963 --> 13:58.266
a... a body count?

13:59.934 --> 14:03.103
Um...

14:03.136 --> 14:04.137
yeah.

14:04.170 --> 14:05.605
Yes, I do.

14:05.639 --> 14:08.275
Yikes. Okay.

14:08.309 --> 14:09.343
Fine.

14:10.944 --> 14:15.616
Ballpark, like... uh...

14:24.058 --> 14:26.528
That's one sold-out ballpark.

14:30.489 --> 14:33.259
Zo... Zoey, are you okay?

14:33.800 --> 14:36.703
Are you with God right now?

14:36.737 --> 14:38.439
Yeah, no, I'm fine.
I was just taking a second

14:38.472 --> 14:40.172
to count the amount of people
I've been with.

14:40.197 --> 14:41.541
One... two...

14:41.574 --> 14:43.210
Oh, nailed it! I'm back.

14:43.243 --> 14:44.878
I knew this was gonna happen.

14:44.911 --> 14:47.013
Oh, no, nothing happened.
You've done nothing wrong.

14:47.046 --> 14:50.350
I just... maybe need a minute or two.

14:50.383 --> 14:53.153
Which, again, is the amount
of people I've been with.

14:53.186 --> 14:54.554
Dos.

14:54.588 --> 14:56.623
That's "two" in Spanish.

14:59.756 --> 15:01.231
<i>How did it go today?</i>

15:06.568 --> 15:09.058
<i>It was... loud?</i>

15:10.193 --> 15:12.395
<i>Ah, gotcha.</i>

15:12.450 --> 15:16.170
<i>I just had a hard time connecting
with a girl screaming at me.</i>

15:16.835 --> 15:18.704
<i>Art is weird.</i>

15:20.519 --> 15:21.995
<i>I hear you.</i>

15:22.058 --> 15:24.316
<i>Listen, gay people can make bad art too.</i>

15:25.692 --> 15:26.856
<i>Yeah, I said it.</i>

15:28.168 --> 15:31.120
<i>I get it. I just feel like
I need some sort of...</i>

15:31.190 --> 15:33.300
<i>crash course in Queer culture.</i>

15:35.473 --> 15:37.073
<i>On it.</i>

15:37.112 --> 15:38.903
<i>Clear your schedule next week.</i>

15:38.966 --> 15:41.442
<i>In the meantime,
listen to the good stuff.</i>

15:45.536 --> 15:47.724
<i>Call me after you've listened to it.</i>

15:48.060 --> 15:50.006
<i>Enough with the texting.</i>

16:06.559 --> 16:09.130
Art sucks.

16:09.163 --> 16:10.464
Yeah.

16:10.497 --> 16:12.400
The arts programs should be cancelled.

16:12.433 --> 16:13.900
And NPR. And Elizabeth Warren.

16:13.934 --> 16:15.535
You know what? Just eat your crackers.

16:15.569 --> 16:18.072
And the deep dive was a bust,
by the way.

16:18.104 --> 16:19.639
So, thank you very little.

16:19.673 --> 16:21.242
All it did was mess with my head.

16:21.275 --> 16:23.276
Hey, no, don't blame the dive.

16:23.309 --> 16:25.445
You wanted answers about
his past, you got them.

16:25.478 --> 16:26.780
But it made things worse

16:26.814 --> 16:28.248
because I can't do anything about it.

16:28.281 --> 16:30.050
Like, it's actual torture.

16:30.083 --> 16:31.151
Yeah, I get it.

16:31.184 --> 16:32.585
But if you think about it,

16:32.618 --> 16:35.122
Luca seems pretty tolerant of your past.

16:35.155 --> 16:36.390
What's that supposed to mean?

16:36.423 --> 16:39.093
I'm just saying,
Aaron's around all the time.

16:39.126 --> 16:40.394
Aaron? So?

16:40.426 --> 16:42.429
I mean, like, Aaron and I
were never a thing.

16:42.463 --> 16:46.099
So, sure, we hooked up, but it's
not like we were ever in love.

16:46.132 --> 16:47.100
I mean...

16:49.169 --> 16:50.804
- ...that is true.
- Huh.

16:50.838 --> 16:54.107
I guess... I never considered that.

16:54.141 --> 16:56.176
Yeah, well, back to my point...

16:56.209 --> 17:00.080
Before this morning,
I actually trusted him.

17:00.114 --> 17:03.184
So, you feel like he broke that trust?

17:03.216 --> 17:04.819
No, not exactly.

17:04.851 --> 17:08.121
I just...

17:08.155 --> 17:11.924
I feel insecure, and I have
more questions than ever now.

17:11.959 --> 17:14.862
Okay. If you're having
questions, that's one thing.

17:14.895 --> 17:17.365
But if you're feeling insecure,

17:17.396 --> 17:20.001
that's not something
the deep dive can fix.

17:20.032 --> 17:22.002
That's a you problem.

17:22.036 --> 17:23.703
Ouch.

17:23.736 --> 17:25.038
Hey, but what do I know?

17:25.070 --> 17:27.308
No, I slept with a box
of crackers last night.

17:30.411 --> 17:32.013
Uh, it's open.

17:33.180 --> 17:34.815
Oh.

17:34.848 --> 17:36.817
You know, I'm gonna head out.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.719
I'll uh... give you two some privacy.

17:39.752 --> 17:41.688
'Kay. Bye.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.294
Hey.

17:48.896 --> 17:50.364
Hey.

17:50.396 --> 17:53.800
Look, I know how much that
tattoo bothered you, so...

17:53.834 --> 17:55.369
I got it covered up.

17:55.402 --> 17:56.703
Already?

17:59.906 --> 18:04.377
And that is just a Band-Aid
with my name on it.

18:04.411 --> 18:07.248
My ink guy lives in Ecuador
on a tapioca farm,

18:07.280 --> 18:10.050
so... I did my best.

18:10.084 --> 18:11.919
It's not bad.

18:11.952 --> 18:15.556
Look, um... I'm sorry I put
you out there like that.

18:15.588 --> 18:19.260
And I'm sorry if I shut down
your questions about Juliette.

18:19.292 --> 18:21.694
I just...

18:21.728 --> 18:23.397
I process shit through art,

18:23.430 --> 18:27.068
and if you need to process
shit through questions,

18:27.100 --> 18:29.402
then... ask away.

18:31.905 --> 18:33.406
W... Really?

18:33.440 --> 18:34.775
Anything.

18:37.411 --> 18:39.380
<i>My mind was racing.</i>

18:39.413 --> 18:43.117
<i>I was sure no girlfriend ever
had been granted such access.</i>

18:43.149 --> 18:45.251
<i>Boundaries be damned.</i>

18:45.284 --> 18:48.555
<i>I could have the answer to
any question about his past.</i>

18:48.588 --> 18:50.758
<i>Questions like... "Who was your first?</i>

18:50.790 --> 18:52.259
<i>Did you love her?</i>

18:52.291 --> 18:54.227
<i>Have you ever had your heart broken?"</i>

18:56.296 --> 18:58.899
<i>"Have you ever been with
an older woman?"</i>

18:58.932 --> 19:01.702
Okay. Then that sounds
like a plan. I'll be there.

19:07.307 --> 19:09.143
<i>"Have you ever fallen for someone</i>

19:09.175 --> 19:11.145
<i>you knew was totally wrong for you?"</i>

19:17.117 --> 19:19.386
I'm sorry I was trying to
push you away. I just...

19:37.303 --> 19:40.907
<i>And the scariest question of all...</i>

19:40.941 --> 19:43.309
<i>"Do I love you more than you love me?"</i>

19:46.312 --> 19:48.348
Floor is yours, kid.

19:48.382 --> 19:51.285
<i>But you better be ready
to hear the answer</i>

19:51.318 --> 19:56.323
<i>because it's a line
that can't be uncrossed.</i>

19:56.356 --> 19:57.625
No. I'm good.

20:00.726 --> 20:04.264
Hello.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.052
This one.

20:15.077 --> 20:18.372
It should be just like this,
except with my name.

20:18.478 --> 20:23.317
You want me to get "Zoey" tattooed
across my whole entire back?

20:23.349 --> 20:25.218
Yes.

20:25.251 --> 20:27.037
All right, I mean, you know,
part of the deal is that

20:27.061 --> 20:28.912
- you have to get one, too.
- Oh, yeah, trust.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.973
I'm thinking of getting #xavierstrong.

20:32.392 --> 20:34.895
He was a good dog.

20:34.927 --> 20:37.197
"Was"?

20:37.231 --> 20:41.035
Yeah. The gazebo didn't get him,
but the canine gingivitis did.

20:41.068 --> 20:42.368
You know what? You're right.

20:42.402 --> 20:46.073
Let's just get yours lasered off.

20:46.106 --> 20:47.575
All right, babe.
