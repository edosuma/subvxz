WEBVTT

00:10.971 --> 00:12.052
HEY, FAMILY.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.013
(all shout greetings)

00:14.014 --> 00:15.975
I THOUGHT YOU WERE AT GLEN'S HOUSE?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

00:15.976 --> 00:17.016
OH, I'M NOT REALLY HERE.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.190
I JUST, UM, CAME TO
PICK UP MY TOOTHBRUSH.

00:20.731 --> 00:23.484
YOU'VE BEEN GONE THREE DAYS AND YOU JUST NOW
REALIZED YOU DIDN'T HAVE YOUR TOOTHBRUSH?

00:24.485 --> 00:26.737
YEAH, I WAS USING GLEN'S,
BUT THEN IT WORE OUT.

00:28.489 --> 00:30.029
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST STAY FOR DINNER?

00:30.030 --> 00:31.111
JOE MADE POT ROAST.

00:31.112 --> 00:32.452
OOH, I LOVE YOUR POT ROAST.

00:32.453 --> 00:34.244
THIS IS GONNA BE SO GOOD
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

00:34.245 --> 00:35.455
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SEE YOU GUYS!

00:35.456 --> 00:36.536
- LOVE YA!
- BYE!

00:36.537 --> 00:37.577
WHOA, HEY, WAIT A MINUTE, MAN.

00:37.578 --> 00:39.619
YOU CAN'T TAKE THE WHOLE THING!
YO, RYDER!

00:39.620 --> 00:41.000
HOW IS THAT LOVE?

00:41.001 --> 00:42.832
HE TOOK THE POT ROAST. THAT
WAS GOING TO BE MY BREAKFAST.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.585
HMM, WELL, MAYBE THIS
WILL TIDE YOU OVER.

00:48.129 --> 00:49.339
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, ALL RIGHT?

00:49.340 --> 00:51.971
THAT POT ROAST IS NOT GOING TO
LAST FOREVER. HE'LL BE BACK.

00:51.972 --> 00:53.723
OOH, SOMEBODY SMELLS GOOD.

00:53.724 --> 00:56.306
OH, YEAH. THAT'S MY NEW SHAMPOO.
IT'S CRUELTY-FREE.

00:56.307 --> 00:57.848
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?
'CAUSE IT'S KILLIN' ME.

01:00.020 --> 01:02.102
HEY, THERE ARE IMPRESSIONABLE
YOUNG CHILDREN HERE.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.444
AND HORRIFIED YOUNG ADULTS.

01:04.445 --> 01:06.896
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE THERE
WERE SO MANY SENSITIVE YOUNG PEOPLE

01:06.897 --> 01:07.987
HERE IN THE KITCHEN.

01:07.988 --> 01:10.320
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WE'RE GONNA LEAVE
THE REST OF THE DISHES TO YOU ALL,

01:10.321 --> 01:12.742
AND, UM, MEL AND I ARE
GONNA SAY GOOD NIGHT.

01:12.743 --> 01:14.695

01:15.656 --> 01:18.078
DON'T THEY KNOW MARRIED PEOPLE
AREN'T SUPPOSED TO DO IT ANYMORE?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.371
I'M GLAD WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

01:21.372 --> 01:23.083
UGH, I'M SURROUNDED.

WHAT? WOW. HONEY, NO,
ALL I'M SAYING IS,

01:55.696 --> 01:58.829
THAT IF THAT DIDN'T JUST MAKE A
BABY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL.

02:00.451 --> 02:02.502
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M ON BIRTH CONTROL.

02:02.503 --> 02:03.833
YOU'RE WHAT?

02:03.834 --> 02:05.665
HEY, WE'RE MARRIED NOW.

02:05.666 --> 02:07.797
I MEAN, I JUST... I DON'T KNOW,
I ASSUMED THAT YOU, YOU KNOW...

02:07.798 --> 02:10.009
PULLED THE GOALIE.

02:10.010 --> 02:12.011
PULLED THE GOALIE? OH!

02:12.012 --> 02:15.305
NOPE. NOPE, MY GOALIE IS STILL IN THE GAME.
PLAYING EVERY PERIOD.

02:15.306 --> 02:16.807
SWATTING AWAY YOUR
LITTLE PUCKS RIGHT NOW.

02:18.559 --> 02:21.261
WE SAID, "I DO." I
THOUGHT "I DO" MEANT,

02:21.262 --> 02:23.973
I DO... NOT USE BIRTH
CONTROL ANYMORE.

02:23.974 --> 02:27.026
I SAID I WANTED TO START
A FAMILY SOON, NOT NOW.

02:27.027 --> 02:28.318
OH, I SEE. SOON.

02:28.319 --> 02:30.230
NOT NOW, SO...

02:30.231 --> 02:31.771
SO, SOON, THEN.
WELL, WHAT'S SOON?

02:31.772 --> 02:33.443
I MEAN, IS THAT LIKE, UH...

02:33.444 --> 02:34.824
I DON'T KNOW, 10 MINUTES?

02:34.825 --> 02:35.946
'CAUSE I COULD EASILY
BE READY BY THEN.

02:36.947 --> 02:39.409
COME ON. YOU'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN.

02:39.410 --> 02:41.781
JOE, LOOK, WE'RE NEWLYWEDS.

02:41.782 --> 02:44.584
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD
SPOIL EACH OTHER.

02:44.585 --> 02:46.836
TAKE SOME TIME FOR
OURSELVES AND OUR CAREERS.

02:46.837 --> 02:49.290
AND NOT WORRY ABOUT THE
PRESSURE TO HAVE KIDS.

02:50.751 --> 02:53.883
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. FINE.
YEAH, COOL.

02:53.884 --> 02:55.845
NO MORE PRESSURE FROM ME.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.928
ALTHOUGH, WE DID JUST
GO INTO OVERTIME.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.102
MAYBE YOUR GOALIE NEEDS A BREAK?

03:06.477 --> 03:07.567
ZANDER, WHAT'S UP?

03:07.568 --> 03:09.979
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO START WORKING
ON "CASSANDRA" HALF AN HOUR AGO.

03:09.980 --> 03:12.362
I'M SORRY. I KNOW. I WAS
RUNNING ERRANDS FOR MY BOSS,

03:12.363 --> 03:14.113
THE ESTEEMED THORNDYKE WELLES,

03:14.114 --> 03:16.906
BUT, I'M HERE NOW, AND I PROMISE
NO MORE INTERRUPTIONS...

03:16.907 --> 03:17.947
(phone rings)

03:17.948 --> 03:18.949
OH.

03:21.872 --> 03:23.454
HELLO, MR. THORNDYKE WELLES

03:25.125 --> 03:26.287
YEAH, HE MAKES ME CALL HIM THAT.

03:27.788 --> 03:28.828
UH-HUH. YES, SIR.

03:28.829 --> 03:30.711
YEAH, ABSOLUTELY. I
WILL BE RIGHT THERE.

03:32.172 --> 03:33.463
WELL, YOU KNOW,

03:33.464 --> 03:36.796
IT IS KIND OF COOL THE WAY HE
RELIES ON YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

03:36.797 --> 03:39.008
YOU'RE THE GO-TO GUY
FOR THE GREAT ARTIST.

03:39.009 --> 03:40.680
YEAH, GO TO THE DRY CLEANERS.

03:40.681 --> 03:42.892
GO TO THE SUPERMARKET.

03:42.893 --> 03:44.013
GO TO THE DRUG STORE

03:44.014 --> 03:46.807
AND PICK UP MAXI PADS FOR HIS
MENSTRUATING COLLIE, FREIDA.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.690
IT'S ALL GOING TO MY HEAD.

03:50.941 --> 03:52.942
HEY, SORRY I'M LATE.

03:52.943 --> 03:54.564
WENT AND GRABBED A
BEER WITH THORNDYKE.

03:54.565 --> 03:56.235
WOW, IS HE A YAPPER.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.908
COULDN'T GET THORNY TO SHUT UP.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.120
THORNY?

04:01.121 --> 04:03.624
YEAH. HE MAKES ME CALL HIM THAT.

04:04.705 --> 04:06.956
AND YOU GOT TO GO OUT
DRINKING WITH HIM?

04:06.957 --> 04:08.918
I HAD TO TAKE HIS DOG TO THE
GROOMERS TO GET HER NAILS CLIPPED.

04:08.919 --> 04:10.921
THAT WAS MY IDEA.

04:12.503 --> 04:16.086
THAT LITTLE CLICKETY-CLAKING ALL OVER
THE STUDIO WAS DRIVING ME CRAZY.

04:17.588 --> 04:18.589
OH, GOOD.

04:19.590 --> 04:21.551
I DON'T WORK FOR THORNDYKE,
I WORK FOR MARCO.

04:21.552 --> 04:23.594
TECHNICALLY, YOU
WORK FOR THE DOG.

04:25.265 --> 04:26.847
WELL, I'M HITTING THE SHOWER.

04:31.021 --> 04:33.102
OKAY, ZANDER, ZANDER,
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

04:33.103 --> 04:34.944
THIS SUCKS, BUT, UM...

04:34.945 --> 04:36.316
I KNOW WHAT WILL CHEER
YOU UP, THOUGH!

04:36.317 --> 04:38.319
THERE'S A BASQUIAT
EXHIBIT AT THE MUSEUM.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.861
LET'S GO TONIGHT.

04:41.862 --> 04:43.403
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'D LIKE THAT.

04:43.404 --> 04:46.035
OH, BUT IT HAS TO BE AFTER
FREIDA'S EVENING WALK.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.328
THORNY MAKES ME DOCUMENT
ALL OF HER POOPS.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.079
WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU WEREN'T
ALLOWED TO CALL HIM THAT?

04:50.080 --> 04:53.003
I'M DOCUMENTING DOG POOP.
PLEASE, LET ME HAVE THORNY.

04:56.337 --> 04:58.588
THERE'S MY BEAUTIFUL BRIDE.

04:58.589 --> 04:59.629
I GOT YOU SOMETHING.

04:59.630 --> 05:01.552
(gasps) OOH, IS IT DIAMONDS?

05:05.225 --> 05:06.687
NO, IT IS NOT DIAMONDS.

05:08.479 --> 05:09.480
THAT'S OKAY.

05:11.482 --> 05:12.812
OH, GREAT, YOU'RE ALL HERE.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.855
GUESS WHO FINALLY FIGURED OUT WHAT
HE WANTS TO DO WITH HIS LIFE?

05:15.856 --> 05:17.066
YOU?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.609
DID I TELL YOU ALREADY?

05:19.900 --> 05:20.990
NO.

05:20.991 --> 05:22.402
OKAY, GREAT, BECAUSE HERE IT IS.

05:22.403 --> 05:25.945
I'M GOING TO MOVE LOUISIANA
TO VOLUNTEER FOR AMERICORPS!

05:25.946 --> 05:27.538
I'M GONNA BECOME A
TEACHER'S ASSISTANT.

05:29.950 --> 05:32.041
YOU KNOW, I ACTUALLY HEAR
THAT'S A GREAT ORGANIZATION.

05:32.042 --> 05:33.082
BUT, UM...

05:33.083 --> 05:35.956
DON'T YOU NEED TO KNOW
SOMETHING BEFORE YOU TEACH IT?

05:37.628 --> 05:39.879
WHERE DID THIS SUDDEN DESIRE
TO VOLUNTEER COME FROM?

05:39.880 --> 05:41.842
I'VE ALWAYS SAID I
WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE.

05:43.133 --> 05:44.173
WHEN?

05:44.174 --> 05:46.596
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN GIVE
ME A RIDE TO SCHOOL.

05:46.597 --> 05:49.559
OKAY, MAYBE I NEVER SAID IT OUT
LOUD, BUT I WAS THINKING IT.

05:49.560 --> 05:52.472
OOH, OOH, IF YOU'RE GOING TO
LOUISIANA, CAN I HAVE YOUR ROOM?

05:52.473 --> 05:53.523
SURE.

05:53.524 --> 05:55.185
YOU SEE, HELPING PEOPLE.

05:56.777 --> 05:57.857
- THANKS.
- NO.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.899
NO, NO, NOBODY'S GETTING
ANYBODY'S ROOMS.

05:59.900 --> 06:03.032
RYDER, LISTEN, I KNOW YOU THINK YOU HAVE
A GOOD IDEA HERE, BUT YOU REALLY DON'T.

06:03.033 --> 06:04.243
AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

06:04.244 --> 06:05.825
I... YOU KNOW, LISTEN,
JOE, I GOTTA GO.

06:05.826 --> 06:07.487
NO-NO-NO-NO-NO, BUDDY,
BUDDY, BUDDY, LISTEN.

06:07.488 --> 06:09.909
LISTEN, THIS IS ONLY GONNA
TAKE LIKE, TWO MINUTES.

06:09.910 --> 06:12.331
MORE LIKE TWO HOURS.

06:12.332 --> 06:14.333
- I'M OUT OF HERE.
- YEAH, WAIT FOR ME.

06:14.334 --> 06:15.996
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
- OH, I HATE BEING A GROWNUP.

06:17.998 --> 06:22.462
LISTEN, DUDE, THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS
WHY YOU SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE. OKAY?

06:22.463 --> 06:23.673
TO START WITH...

06:23.674 --> 06:25.054
UMM, SHOULD I SIT DOWN FOR THIS?

06:25.055 --> 06:26.346
I'M GONNA.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.640
LENNOX!

06:30.681 --> 06:33.683
IT'S PAYDAY, AND YOU
AND I ARE GOING OUT.

06:33.684 --> 06:34.855
PICK ANY PLACE YOU WANT TO GO.

06:35.976 --> 06:38.147
OH, I'M GOING TO THE
MUSEUM WITH ZANDER.

06:38.148 --> 06:39.939
SO, YOU HAVE A DATE
WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND?

06:39.940 --> 06:42.361
WHAT? NO. IT'S NOT A DATE.

06:42.362 --> 06:45.024
WE'RE JUST GOING TO DINNER
AND THEN TO AN ART EXHIBIT.

06:45.025 --> 06:47.156
I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
GONNA BE MAKING OUT.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.659
SO, IT'S A BAD DATE.

06:50.661 --> 06:52.872
HE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO CHEER HIM UP.

06:52.873 --> 06:53.913
OKAY, HERE'S A CRAZY IDEA.

06:53.914 --> 06:56.746
HE GETS HIS OWN GIRLFRIEND
AND STAYS AWAY FROM MINE.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.918
OH, IS THIS A JEALOUSY THING?

06:58.919 --> 07:00.339
OH, PLEASE.

07:00.340 --> 07:02.422
IS BATMAN JEALOUS
OF CHARLIE BROWN?

07:04.595 --> 07:06.385
OKAY, MARCO, YOU
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:06.386 --> 07:08.097
NO, I UNDERSTAND A LOT.

07:08.098 --> 07:10.389
YOU'RE OVER HIM, BUT
HE IS NOT OVER YOU.

07:10.390 --> 07:12.351
AND YOU'RE NOT HELPING
HIM BY LEADING HIM ON.

07:12.352 --> 07:13.973
OKAY, BUT IT'S NOT A DATE!

07:13.974 --> 07:16.396
AND THIS IS NOT ME
WALKING OUT THE DOOR.

07:18.018 --> 07:20.691
SEE? I CAN PUT A "NOT"
BEFORE STUFF, TOO.

07:22.943 --> 07:25.274
SO, TO SUM UP...

07:25.275 --> 07:26.446
WE HAVE, UM...

07:28.158 --> 07:29.779
JOB PROSPECTS,

07:29.780 --> 07:30.990
OKAY, SOCIAL GROWTH,

07:30.991 --> 07:32.912
FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE.
ALL RIGHT?

07:32.913 --> 07:36.165
BUT LISTEN, THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON
THAT YOU NEED TO GO TO COLLEGE,

07:36.166 --> 07:38.879
IS BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE PAYING
FOR ANYTHING ELSE UNLESS YOU DO.

07:40.210 --> 07:41.631
LOOK, AUNT MEL, JOE,

07:41.632 --> 07:44.504
THIS IS GONNA BE VERY, VERY,
GOOD FOR ME, ALL RIGHT?

07:44.505 --> 07:46.465
GLEN'S COUSIN IS
IN THE PROGRAM TOO

07:46.466 --> 07:48.548
AND WE'RE GOING TO NEW
ORLEANS TOGETHER.

07:48.549 --> 07:50.640
RYDER, YOU LEFT ME IN THE
CAR WITHOUT THE KEYS.

07:50.641 --> 07:52.592
I CAN'T EVEN LISTEN
TO THE RADIO.

07:52.593 --> 07:53.893
DID YOU FORGET ABOUT ME?

07:53.894 --> 07:55.264
NO, NEVER, JULIET.

07:55.265 --> 07:57.647
OH, GUYS, THIS IS JULIET.

07:57.648 --> 08:00.149
OH, ARE YOU, BY ANY
CHANCE, GLEN'S COUSIN?

08:00.150 --> 08:01.812
UH-HUH! HOW'D YOU KNOW?

08:03.103 --> 08:04.864
I TOOK A SHOT.

08:04.865 --> 08:06.656
WELL, UM, LISTEN, WE GOTTA GO.

08:06.657 --> 08:08.407
JULIET HAS A YOGA CLASS,

08:08.408 --> 08:09.869
AND I'M GONNA, UM...

08:09.870 --> 08:10.871
I'M GONNA WATCH.

08:12.613 --> 08:14.744
THIS IS NOT OVER. WE'RE GONNA
TALK MORE ABOUT THIS LATER, MAN.

08:14.745 --> 08:15.825
OKAY, SURE THING.

08:15.826 --> 08:16.997
- SURE THING.
- SEE YOU!

08:19.119 --> 08:20.329
DON'T WORRY.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.501
ONCE THIS FLING FIZZLES OUT,
HE'LL BE BACK HERE IN NO TIME

08:22.502 --> 08:25.796
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AND EATING
LIKE A BEAR BEFORE HIBERNATION.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.589
BEARS REMEMBER THEIR TOOTHBRUSH.

08:29.590 --> 08:30.680
HEY, HEY, HEY!

08:30.681 --> 08:32.892
I BELIEVE YOU MENTIONED A
LITTLE GIFT WHEN YOU WALKED IN?

08:32.893 --> 08:35.224
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE,
LET ME GIVE THIS TO YOU, OKAY?

08:35.225 --> 08:37.056
ALL RIGHT. NOW,
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

08:37.057 --> 08:39.228
YOU KNOW, I GOT CAUGHT UP IN THE
WHOLE EMOTION OF THE MOMENT.

08:39.229 --> 08:41.100
TALKING ABOUT BABIES AND STUFF,

08:41.101 --> 08:43.943
BUT, I WANT TO LET YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND
YOUR POINT OF VIEW, SO, I GOT YOU THIS.

08:43.944 --> 08:45.025
AWW.

08:50.030 --> 08:50.821
A HOCKEY PLAYER?

08:50.822 --> 08:53.703
NO, THAT'S A GOALIE! THATS...

08:53.704 --> 08:54.705
THAT'S BIRTH CONTROL.

08:56.917 --> 08:57.918
YEAH, I DON'T THINK SO.

08:59.119 --> 09:01.250
LOOK, THIS IS MY WAY OF SAYING,

09:01.251 --> 09:04.754
YOU CAN KEEP THE GOALIE IN THE
GAME FOR AS LONG AS YOU NEED TO.

09:04.755 --> 09:06.425
NO MORE BABY PRESSURE FROM ME.

09:06.426 --> 09:07.427
AWW.

09:10.881 --> 09:13.432
- HEY, MEL.
- HEY.

09:13.433 --> 09:15.885
MEL, LOOK WHO WANTED
TO STOP BY FOR DINNER.

09:15.886 --> 09:17.597
NATE AND GILLIAN.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.889
OH, AND THE BABY THEY MADE.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.984
WHAT A PRESSURE BABY...
PRECIOUS BABY!

09:28.859 --> 09:29.989
ISN'T THIS GREAT, MEL?

09:29.990 --> 09:32.361
NATE AND GILLIAN JUST,
UH, WANTED TO STOP BY.

09:32.362 --> 09:33.402
YOU ASKED US TO COME OVER.

09:33.403 --> 09:34.825
LET'S NOT QUIBBLE
OVER THE DETAILS.

09:36.196 --> 09:38.998
JOE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR JUST ONE LITTLE SEC?

09:38.999 --> 09:40.410
ME? YEAH, SURE.

09:43.794 --> 09:44.964
YOU ASKED THEM TO COME OVER HERE

09:44.965 --> 09:47.757
SO THEY COULD THROW THAT LITTLE BALL
OF JOY AND WONDER RIGHT IN MY FACE.

09:47.758 --> 09:50.509
WHAT KIND OF GUY WOULD I BE IF I
INVITED NATE AND GILLIAN OVER HERE

09:50.510 --> 09:52.632
AND I DIDN'T ALSO INVITE
THEIR LITTLE BABY?

09:52.633 --> 09:55.305
THIS LITTLE BABY AMBUSH OF
YOURS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

09:56.306 --> 09:58.928
YOU'RE SO CUTE, YOU'RE SO CUTE!

09:58.929 --> 10:00.680
OH, YOU'RE A CUTE LITTLE
BALL OF JOY AND WONDER!

10:00.681 --> 10:02.932
YES YOU ARE, YES YOU ARE!

10:02.933 --> 10:07.937
(making baby noises)

10:07.938 --> 10:10.279
WELL, I GOT FREIDA HER TAMPONS,

10:10.280 --> 10:11.861
PICKED SOME FLEAS OFF HER BUTT,

10:11.862 --> 10:13.654
THEN, TO THANK ME,
SHE LICKED MY FACE.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.735
HELLO.

10:15.736 --> 10:18.658
UH, LILAH, THIS IS ZANDER.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.290
- HELLO.
- I WORK FOR A DOG.

10:22.162 --> 10:26.415
ZANDER, THIS IS MY FRIEND LILAH AND I WAS
JUST SHOWING HER YOUR AMAZING DRAWINGS.

10:26.416 --> 10:29.128
SHE'S A FILM MAJOR AND
HAS GREAT VISUAL SENSE.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.670
YEAH, THESE ARE INTERESTING.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.511
OH, COOL.

10:32.512 --> 10:36.717
THE WAY YOU INTENTIONALLY MAKE
YOUR IMAGES LOOK FLAT AND STATIC.

10:39.810 --> 10:41.640
FLAT AND STATIC?

10:41.641 --> 10:43.522
THAT'S JUST WHAT EVERY
ARTIST LOVES TO HEAR.

10:43.523 --> 10:46.105
OH, YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE.

10:46.106 --> 10:47.186
SORRY, ONE OF WHAT?

10:47.187 --> 10:48.769
YOU JUST WANT TO HEAR
HOW GREAT YOU ARE.

10:53.153 --> 10:54.154
EXCUSE ME.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.446
COULD I TALK TO YOU FOR
JUST TWO QUICK SECONDS?

10:57.447 --> 10:59.449
(laughing)

11:00.540 --> 11:01.742
WHO'S THE FREAK?

11:02.743 --> 11:04.083
LILAH IS NICE.

11:04.084 --> 11:06.045
YEAH, I'M NOT GETTING THAT.

11:06.046 --> 11:07.787
OKAY, I'M TRYING TO
FIX YOU UP, ZANDER.

11:07.788 --> 11:09.709
I CAN'T BE SPENDING ALL
THIS TIME WITH YOU.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.962
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND, AND YOU
NEED TO FIND A GIRLFRIEND.

11:12.963 --> 11:16.136
AND I THINK YOU AND LILAH
HAVE A LOT IN COMMON.

11:20.801 --> 11:22.762
YEAH, SHE LOOKS FUN.

11:22.763 --> 11:24.974
OH, AND THIS IS PERFECT TIMING.

11:24.975 --> 11:28.358
SHE JUST WENT THROUGH A PHASE WITH WOMEN,
AND SHE'S WORKING HER WAY BACK TO GUYS.

11:31.191 --> 11:33.814
SO WHAT, I'M THE REST STOP
ON HER HIGHWAY BACK TO MEN?

11:35.615 --> 11:36.986
JUST GIVE HER A CHANCE.

11:36.987 --> 11:38.027
FINE.

11:38.028 --> 11:40.369
I'LL ASK THE BEAUTIFUL
BISEXUAL GIRL OUT.

11:40.370 --> 11:41.872
BUT I'M ONLY DOING THIS FOR YOU.

11:45.916 --> 11:48.327
WHO'S A BIG BOY?
WHO'S A BIG BOY?

11:48.328 --> 11:50.419
HEY, IF HE'S GETTING TOO
HEAVY, I CAN TAKE HIM BACK.

11:50.420 --> 11:51.961
NO-NO-NO-NO, I GOT HIM.
I GOT HIM.

11:51.962 --> 11:52.963
I GOT HIM! GIMME!

11:54.835 --> 11:57.757
YOU KNOW, MEL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO GIVE THE BABY BACK EVENTUALLY.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.220
OR ELSE THEY'RE GONNA
PRESS CHARGES.

12:01.842 --> 12:02.892
YEAH, BUT WE...

12:02.893 --> 12:05.644
HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN THE
BUNNY OUTSIDE YET!

12:05.645 --> 12:06.806
HE DOES LOVE BUNNIES.

12:06.807 --> 12:08.978
OH, GOOD. BUH-BYE!

12:08.979 --> 12:10.559
(sighs)

12:10.560 --> 12:14.273
IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE MY BOOBS BACK TO
MYSELF, EVEN FOR ONLY A FEW MINUTES.

12:14.274 --> 12:16.857
YEAH, I FORGOT WHAT THEY LOOK
LIKE WITHOUT A BABY ATTACHED.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.619
LOOK AT YOU TWO MAKING JOKES.

12:20.620 --> 12:22.741
THERE HASN'T BEEN A
LOT OF JOKING LATELY.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.953
WHICH IS FINE.

12:23.954 --> 12:26.957
BECAUSE SINCE I HAD THE BABY,
WHENEVER I LAUGH, I PEE A LITTLE.

12:28.208 --> 12:30.539
YEAH, SHE'S GONE THROUGH MORE
DIAPERS THAN THE KID HAS.

12:30.540 --> 12:32.171
OH, COME ON, GUYS.

12:32.172 --> 12:35.174
BUT YOU BROUGHT THIS, YOU KNOW,
PRECIOUS LITTLE BABY INTO THE WORLD?

12:35.175 --> 12:36.755
YEAH, JOE, DON'T GET US WRONG.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.468
WE LOVE... UM...

12:39.469 --> 12:40.880
EDDIE.

12:40.881 --> 12:44.014
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE.

12:44.845 --> 12:46.515
WE'RE NOT TRYING TO SCARE YOU,

12:46.516 --> 12:49.479
BUT HAVING A BABY RUINS
EVERY PART OF YOUR LIFE.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.311
I'M SO SLEEP DEPRIVED,

12:52.312 --> 12:54.153
I HAD LUNCH WITH MY BOSS,

12:54.154 --> 12:56.946
AND AFTERWARDS, I
TRIED TO BURP HIM.

12:56.947 --> 12:58.567
YEAH, BUT NOW THAT
YOU HAD THE BABY,

12:58.568 --> 13:00.900
DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S, YOU KNOW,
BROUGHT YOU GUYS CLOSER TOGETHER?

13:00.901 --> 13:03.282
YEAH. LIKE CELL MATES.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.864
EXCEPT WE DON'T HAVE SEX.

13:04.865 --> 13:07.036
(laughing)

13:07.037 --> 13:07.828
UH-OH.

13:07.829 --> 13:08.829
EXCUSE ME.

13:13.293 --> 13:15.174
YOU THINKING OF
HAVING KIDS, JOE?

13:15.175 --> 13:16.837
YEAH.

13:18.718 --> 13:19.798
ABSOLUTELY.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.923
AS A NEW FATHER, LET ME
GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.514
DON'T.

13:25.515 --> 13:28.097
WAIT, DAVE, COME ON.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.980
YOU AND GILLIAN ARE SUCH A GREAT COUPLE.
I MEAN...

13:30.981 --> 13:32.811
ALL RIGHT, SO YOU'RE GOING
THROUGH SOME TOUGH TIMES.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.813
BUT THE ROMANCE IS
GONNA COME BACK, MAN.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.647
WILL IT, JOE? WILL IT?

13:38.939 --> 13:41.901
NAME ONE COUPLE WHOSE SEX LIFE
CAME BACK AFTER THEY HAD KIDS.

13:41.902 --> 13:44.034
NATE, THERE ARE TONS, THERE
ARE MILLIONS, ALL RIGHT?

13:46.366 --> 13:48.247
JUST 'CAUSE I CAN'T THINK OF
ANY RIGHT NOW DOESN'T MEAN...

13:48.248 --> 13:49.538
OH, I GOT ONE!

13:49.539 --> 13:51.331
NOPE... THEY'RE DIVORCED.

13:56.256 --> 13:57.296
HEY, MEL.

13:57.297 --> 13:59.879
DID YOU SEE HOW BEAT NATE
AND GILLIAN LOOKED TONIGHT?

13:59.880 --> 14:02.261
WHEW. I TELL YOU, HAVING
A BABY'S A BIG DEAL.

14:02.262 --> 14:04.674
THAT'S CERTAINLY NOT A DECISION
YOU WANT TO TAKE LIGHTLY, HUH?

14:05.966 --> 14:06.806
HEY, HANDSOME.

14:08.808 --> 14:10.139
TAKE A GOOD LOOK
AT THIS NIGHTGOWN.

14:10.140 --> 14:11.680
'CAUSE IT WON'T BE ON FOR LONG.

14:11.681 --> 14:13.642
OOH, OH, YEAH!

14:13.643 --> 14:15.684
YOU KNOW, OH, HONEY. YOU KNOW
WHAT, LET'S... LET'S JUST...

14:15.685 --> 14:16.815
SLOW THINGS DOWN
JUST A LITTLE BIT.

14:16.816 --> 14:19.478
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WERE
MAKING SOME GREAT POINTS LAST NIGHT.

14:19.479 --> 14:22.481
AND WE REALLY HAVE NO NEED
TO RUSH INTO ANYTHING.

14:22.482 --> 14:25.534
UH-HUH. I'M NOT USING
BIRTH CONTROL!

14:25.535 --> 14:26.825
NO, LISTEN, BABE.

14:26.826 --> 14:28.867
I DON'T WANT TO MAKE YOU DO ANYTHING
THAT YOU'RE NOT READY TO DO.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.251
OH, I'M READY! PUT A
BABY IN ME, LONGO!

14:33.833 --> 14:34.873
YOU'RE INTOXICATED.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.996
OKAY, YOU'VE BEEN SNIFFING
BABY HEAD ALL NIGHT LONG.

14:36.997 --> 14:39.258
- TAKE YOUR PANTS OFF NOW!
- WHAT? NO, HEY, NO!

14:39.259 --> 14:40.920
STOP IT! STOP IT! LISTEN TO ME!

14:40.921 --> 14:41.881
DID YOU NOT SEE
NATE AND GILLIAN?

14:41.882 --> 14:43.212
PLEASE DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

14:43.213 --> 14:45.264
WAIT, LISTEN HONEY, THEY'RE MISERABLE.
THEY'RE MISERABLE.

14:45.265 --> 14:46.555
OKAY? ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE.

14:46.556 --> 14:47.596
THEY'RE EXHAUSTED.

14:47.597 --> 14:48.767
THEY CAN'T CONTROL
THEIR BLADDERS.

14:48.768 --> 14:50.099
THEY DON'T EVEN
HAVE SEX ANYMORE.

14:50.100 --> 14:52.311
WAIT, THERE'S NO REASON
THAT WOULD HAPPEN TO US.

14:52.312 --> 14:54.013
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE!

14:54.014 --> 14:57.106
SEX AND ROMANCE DIE
AFTER YOU HAVE A BABY.

14:57.107 --> 14:59.018
THAT'S NOT TRUE!
LOOK AT MY PARENTS.

14:59.019 --> 15:00.859
THEY HAD PLENTY OF SEX
AFTER THEY HAD CHILDREN.

15:00.860 --> 15:02.731
YEAH...

15:02.732 --> 15:03.823
BUT NOT WITH EACH OTHER.

15:04.824 --> 15:06.155
BAD EXAMPLE.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.576
GIVE ME A GOOD EXAMPLE, THEN.
ALL RIGHT?

15:07.577 --> 15:11.530
GIVE ME ONE COUPLE WHOSE ROMANCE
SURVIVED HAVING A BABY?

15:11.531 --> 15:12.581
UMM...

15:12.582 --> 15:14.743
LOOK AT THAT. YOU CAN'T
EVEN GIVE ME ONE!

15:14.744 --> 15:16.206
FRANKLIN AND GRETEL.

15:18.959 --> 15:20.039
WHO?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.710
YEAH. I WORK WITH THEM
DOWN AT CITY HALL.

15:21.711 --> 15:23.342
HE'S IN PARKING,
SHE'S IN PERMITS.

15:23.343 --> 15:25.885
THEY HAVE 11 KIDS, AND THEY CAN'T
KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF EACH OTHER.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.009
DID YOU MAKE THEM UP?

15:29.889 --> 15:31.811
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE
TO DO WITH ANYTHING?

15:34.554 --> 15:35.555
(doorbell rings)

15:38.648 --> 15:39.938
HEY, UMM, LISTEN.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.690
BEFORE WE GET STARTED
WORKING ON "CASSANDRA,"

15:41.691 --> 15:44.773
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I
AM SO SORRY ABOUT LILAH.

15:44.774 --> 15:47.987
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING
TRYING TO FIX YOU GUYS UP.

15:47.988 --> 15:50.279
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
SHE'S AWESOME.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.371
WE'VE BEEN OUT FOUR TIMES.

15:52.412 --> 15:53.952
I INTRODUCED YOU TWO DAYS AGO?

15:53.953 --> 15:55.954
YEAH, WE HIT IT OFF.

15:55.955 --> 15:56.956
SEVERAL TIMES.

15:58.078 --> 15:59.378
AND I CAN SAY WITH
TOTAL CONFIDENCE

15:59.379 --> 16:01.170
THAT LILAH IS DEFINITELY
BACK ON THE MAN TRAIN.

16:01.171 --> 16:02.462
A-CHOO-CHOO!

16:04.384 --> 16:06.295
YEAH, IN FACT, SHE GOT
HER COMMUTER PASS,

16:06.296 --> 16:08.257
AND THAT ENTITLES HER
TO TWO RIDES A DAY

16:08.258 --> 16:11.850
OKAY. YOU DON'T NEED
TO TELL ME EVERYTHING.

16:11.851 --> 16:14.053
BUT, IT SOUNDS LIKE SHE
IS PERFECT FOR YOU.

16:14.054 --> 16:15.724
OH, YOU KNOW, NOTHING'S PERFECT.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.226
SHE'S A BIT FULL OF
HERSELF AT TIMES,

16:17.227 --> 16:18.807
AND A LITTLE CONTROLLING,

16:18.808 --> 16:20.400
BUT APPARENTLY, THAT'S
WHAT I LIKE IN GIRLS.

16:21.811 --> 16:22.861
GOTCHA.

16:22.862 --> 16:23.903
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GET TO WORK.

16:25.025 --> 16:25.815
WHERE'S YOUR COMPUTER?

16:25.816 --> 16:27.906
OH, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I
ACTUALLY CAME HERE TO TELL YOU.

16:27.907 --> 16:29.318
I CAN'T WORK WITH YOU
ON "CASSANDRA" ANYMORE.

16:29.319 --> 16:31.700
WAIT, WHAT? WHY NOT?

16:31.701 --> 16:32.911
WELL...

16:32.912 --> 16:35.914
LILAH DOESN'T WANT ME SPENDING TIME
WITH AN EX. SHE THINKS IT'S WEIRD.

16:35.915 --> 16:37.826
DOES THIS MEAN THAT
"CASSANDRA" IS OVER FOREVER?

16:37.827 --> 16:40.079
WELL, I WOULDN'T SAY
FOREVER, BUT, YOU KNOW,

16:40.080 --> 16:41.620
LILAH DID.

16:41.621 --> 16:44.173
ZANDER, HOW CAN YOU AGREE
TO SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

16:44.174 --> 16:46.045
WELL, IT'S A NEW RELATIONSHIP.
SOMETIMES, YOU GOTTA...

16:46.046 --> 16:48.887
PRETEND YOU'RE OKAY WITH RIDICULOUS
DEMANDS WHEN YOU'RE REALLY NOT?

16:48.888 --> 16:51.010
EXACTLY! SEE? I KNEW
YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

16:52.932 --> 16:54.933
ALL RIGHT, SO, I'LL
SEE YOU LATER.

16:54.934 --> 16:56.436
WELL, YOU KNOW, PROBABLY
NOT, BUT MAYBE.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.900
WHAT WAS ALL THAT ABOUT?

17:01.901 --> 17:03.021
WELL...

17:03.022 --> 17:04.733
I FIXED ZANDER UP WITH LILAH

17:04.734 --> 17:07.947
AND NOW HE'S GOT A GIRLFRIEND
AND I'VE LOST A COLLABORATOR.

17:09.449 --> 17:10.650
AND A FRIEND.

17:15.285 --> 17:18.457
I'M SORRY. I AM TRYING TO
MAKE MY FACE LOOK SAD,

17:18.458 --> 17:20.039
BUT I CAN'T.

17:22.872 --> 17:24.373
- HEY.
- HEY.

17:24.374 --> 17:25.874
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

17:25.875 --> 17:27.256
OH, THE KIDS WENT DOWN
TO THE YOGURT SHOP

17:27.257 --> 17:29.878
TO SEE HOW MANY FREE SAMPLES THEY
COULD GET BEFORE THEY GET THROWN OUT.

17:29.879 --> 17:32.842
OH, WELL, THEY'LL NEVER BEAT MS.
24.

17:34.264 --> 17:37.137
HEY, JOE, I NEED YOU TO TAKE A
LOOK AT THIS CONTRACT FOR ME.

17:38.138 --> 17:39.808
YEAH, OKAY, I'LL LOOK AT THIS.
BUT FIRST...

17:39.809 --> 17:44.233
UMM, I THINK WE SHOULD FINISH OUR WHOLE "FRANKLIN
AND GRETEL" CONVERSATION FROM LAST NIGHT.

17:44.234 --> 17:45.854
I TOLD YOU, I MADE THEM UP.

17:45.855 --> 17:48.567
I KNOW, HONEY, BUT, I JUST... YOU
KNOW, I WANT TO SETTLE THINGS.

17:48.568 --> 17:49.858
TRUST ME. JUST READ THIS.

17:49.859 --> 17:51.360
I...

17:51.361 --> 17:53.402
OKAY. FINE.

17:53.403 --> 17:56.695
"PROPOSED CONTRACT BETWEEN
MEL BURKE AND JOE LONGO

17:56.696 --> 18:00.079
TO PRESERVE SEX AND ROMANCE
ONCE THEY HAVE CHILDREN."

18:02.001 --> 18:03.962
- I'M INTRIGUED.
- KEEP READING.

18:03.963 --> 18:05.544
"I, MEL BURKE,

18:05.545 --> 18:08.168

PROMISES TO JOE LONGO,

18:11.631 --> 18:14.384
HEREAFTER REFERRED
TO AS 'SUGAR PECS.'"

18:16.556 --> 18:18.768
- "SUGAR PECS"? -OKAY, LOOK,
THE NICKNAME'S NEGOTIABLE.

18:19.769 --> 18:20.770
NO, I'M OKAY WITH IT.

18:21.891 --> 18:23.682
"I PROMISE NEVER TO STOP
SAYING 'I LOVE YOU, '

18:23.683 --> 18:26.275

FOUR, SUBSECTION B

18:28.488 --> 18:32.942
WHICH COVERS LAP DANCES, FRENCH KISSES AND
THE STANDARD FRIDAY NIGHT STRIPTEASE.

18:34.073 --> 18:35.074
I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.366
OKAY, AND I CAN'T WAIT.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.737
- TURN TO PAGE FIVE.
- PAGE FIVE.

18:38.738 --> 18:39.948
THAT'S WHERE IT GETS REALLY FUN.

18:39.949 --> 18:42.001
OKAY. OH, THERE'S PICTURES.

18:43.413 --> 18:44.453
OH, THAT'S NICE.

18:44.454 --> 18:46.505
THAT'S VERY NICE.

18:46.506 --> 18:48.667
HONEY, THIS IS VERY SWEET OF
YOU TO WRITE UP THIS CONTRACT,

18:48.668 --> 18:50.799
BUT THERE'S JUST
NO PRECEDENT HERE.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.052
I MEAN, IF NOBODY ELSE HAS BEEN ABLE
TO KEEP THINGS HOT AFTER HAVING KIDS,

18:54.053 --> 18:55.094
WHAT MAKES YOU
THINK THAT WE CAN?

18:56.216 --> 19:00.969
WELL, THERE IS ONE COUPLE WHO HAS
MANAGED TO DEFY THE ODDS, YOU KNOW?

19:00.970 --> 19:05.023
ONE COUPLE WHO, YOU KNOW, FOUGHT
ENDLESSLY FOR THREE YEARS

19:05.024 --> 19:06.226
BUT STILL MANAGED
TO FALL IN LOVE.

19:07.477 --> 19:09.898
THE COUPLE WE'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR TO INSPIRE US?

19:09.899 --> 19:10.900
IT'S US!

19:13.983 --> 19:16.154
YOU REALLY NEED TO
THINK ABOUT THAT?

19:16.155 --> 19:17.986
I'M NOT THINKING ABOUT IT I'M
JUST TAKING A MOMENT HERE,

19:17.987 --> 19:19.828
SO I CAN CHOKE OUT A
SENTENCE WITHOUT TEARING UP

19:19.829 --> 19:22.201
BECAUSE WHAT YOU JUST SAID
WAS SO FREAKING BEAUTIFUL.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.663
SO, UMM, CAN I GET YOUR
SIGNATURE ON THIS?

19:24.664 --> 19:27.996
YES. YOU GOT IT. ALL RIGHT?

19:27.997 --> 19:29.418
OH, AND UMM...

19:29.419 --> 19:32.881
HONEY, I THINK THAT, UMM, MAYBE
WE SHOULD TRY A LITTLE...

19:32.882 --> 19:35.093
PAGE FIVE, SECTION D RIGHT NOW.

19:35.094 --> 19:36.635
EVEN WITH A PULLED GOALIE?

19:36.636 --> 19:39.598
BABE, IT'S SECTION D. WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT GONNA GET ANYBODY PREGNANT.

19:39.599 --> 19:42.060
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT, IF YOU'D RATHER,
WHY DON'T WE START WITH THE BASICS.

19:42.061 --> 19:45.804
WE COULD GO TO GOOD OLD
RELIABLE, MAYBE SECTION A.

19:45.805 --> 19:48.106
WELL, IF WE DO THAT, ONE OF US,

19:48.107 --> 19:49.438
THE ONE WITH THE LADY PARTS,

19:49.439 --> 19:51.069
COULD GET PREGNANT.

19:51.070 --> 19:52.941
YOU READY FOR THAT?

19:52.942 --> 19:53.943
READY?

19:55.945 --> 19:57.487
I'M NOT SURE, BUT WHAT THE HELL?

19:58.488 --> 20:00.529
WAIT, HOLD ON, HOLD ON A MINUTE.

20:00.530 --> 20:01.910
I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M
DOING THIS RIGHT.

20:01.911 --> 20:02.822
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

20:02.823 --> 20:04.243
OKAY.

20:04.244 --> 20:05.824
YEAH, NO, WAIT...

20:05.825 --> 20:06.875

20:06.876 --> 20:07.997
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO...

20:10.960 --> 20:13.502
HEY, GUYS, I JUST GOT A TEXT FROM RYDER.
HE WANTS TO VIDEO CHAT WITH US.

20:13.503 --> 20:16.465
WHAT? CAN'T HE JUST COME HOME? I MEAN,
GLEN'S HOUSE IS 10 BLOCKS AWAY.

20:16.466 --> 20:17.506
HOW LAZY IS HE?

20:17.507 --> 20:20.008
- MEL...
- OH, RIGHT, IT'S RYDER.

20:20.009 --> 20:21.179
WHATEVER. ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

20:21.180 --> 20:23.802
LET'S JUST TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY
TO SET HIM STRAIGHT,

20:23.803 --> 20:24.843
BUT NICELY.

20:24.844 --> 20:27.936
YOU HAVE SPEND AT LEAST ONE YEAR IN
COLLEGE AND THEN YOU CAN JOIN AMERICORPS.

20:27.937 --> 20:30.609
OKAY, YEAH, BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE HIM
FEEL LIKE IT'S HIS DECISION, NOT OURS.

20:30.610 --> 20:31.940
YES, EXACTLY. ALL RIGHT.

20:31.941 --> 20:32.981
- TEAM. TEAM. YO.
- ALL RIGHT.

20:32.982 --> 20:34.313
- YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

20:34.314 --> 20:35.354

20:35.355 --> 20:36.405
HEY, GUYS!

20:36.406 --> 20:37.946
- All: HEY!
- WHAT'S UP, MAN?

20:37.947 --> 20:39.157
ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP, BEAVIS,

20:39.158 --> 20:40.198
YOU'RE NOT DOING AMERICORPS.

20:40.199 --> 20:43.242
KISS JULIET GOODBYE, LEAVE GLEN'S
HOUSE, AND GET YOUR ASS TO COLLEGE.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.915
THOUGH SHE WASN'T VERY
TACTFUL, WE AGREE WITH LENNOX.

20:46.916 --> 20:48.747
WE'D LIKE YOU TO COME BACK
FROM GLEN'S HOUSE NOW.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.999
I REALLY CAN'T

20:51.000 --> 20:52.872
BECAUSE I'M KIND
OF IN NEW ORLEANS.

20:55.174 --> 20:58.216
PLEASE TELL ME THAT'S A NEW
ORLEANS-THEMED RESTAURANT IN OHIO.

20:58.217 --> 21:01.049
NOPE. GOOD OLD NEW
ORLEANS, LOUISIANA,

21:01.050 --> 21:03.182
THE BIG APPLE!

21:04.844 --> 21:07.015
WELL, I HOPPED A
PLANE WITH JULIET,

21:07.016 --> 21:08.187
AND I'M HERE TO
HELP THE CHILDREN.

21:09.188 --> 21:11.851
CAN YOU GUYS SEND ME SOME OF MY
UNDERWEAR AND MY VIDEO GAMES?

21:12.892 --> 21:14.232
I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU, RYDER.

21:14.233 --> 21:17.025
YEAH, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
FORGOT YOUR VIDEO GAMES.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.567
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

21:18.568 --> 21:19.898
WE WENT TO SEE A VOODOO PSYCHIC,

21:19.899 --> 21:21.401
AND EVERYTHING IS
GOING TO BE FINE.

21:22.612 --> 21:25.745
OH, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.
