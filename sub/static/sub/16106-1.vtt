02:40.185 --> 02:41.812
Josh?

02:41.886 --> 02:44.446
Wow. Your old man
let you come up for air?

02:44.522 --> 02:45.682
Oh, you're kidding, right?

02:45.757 --> 02:47.452
Oh, you're going to be in the shit.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.287
Fuck it. Wanted to be here.

02:52.697 --> 02:54.096
So, here she is.

02:54.165 --> 02:55.996
Yeah, reinforcements.

02:56.234 --> 02:57.963
Hey, babe, come meet Josh.

02:58.303 --> 02:59.770
Frank McGuire's boy.

02:59.837 --> 03:02.305
Josh McGuire. I've heard all about you.

03:02.373 --> 03:05.274
So cool your dad brings you
on these expeditions.

03:05.343 --> 03:07.834
Yeah. Yeah, I'm stoked.

03:08.546 --> 03:10.138
How are things at Forward Base?

03:10.215 --> 03:11.648
They still haven't found a way through.

03:11.716 --> 03:14.981
Everyone is tired, getting pissed
off at Dad. Just the usual, really.

03:15.053 --> 03:18.489
As soon as I leave, the whole thing
turns into a Mongolian cluster-fuck.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.524
So, Carl says you're a climber?

03:22.594 --> 03:23.856
I've done a little.

03:23.928 --> 03:26.123
Yes, she is strong like bull,

03:26.197 --> 03:28.131
-smart like tractor.
-Oh. Original.

03:28.199 --> 03:31.293
Hey, Eddie, I'll take right seat.
Josh, jump up front.

03:31.369 --> 03:32.529
Sweet.

04:00.431 --> 04:02.797
The last primeval wilderness.

04:02.867 --> 04:06.166
We go down out here,
even God won't know where we are.

04:06.571 --> 04:09.631
Some mud man will be using our skulls
for a soup bowl.

04:09.707 --> 04:10.935
That wasn't in the brochure, honey.

04:11.009 --> 04:13.807
Yeah, well, we're
living large now, baby.

04:27.925 --> 04:29.449
I have control.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.894
Why do we cave, Josh?

04:40.972 --> 04:43.440
Well, I don't, voluntarily.

04:43.508 --> 04:44.941
Nope, wrong answer.

04:45.009 --> 04:47.068
And why do you cave, Carl?

04:47.145 --> 04:48.271
Because...

04:50.648 --> 04:52.240
Let me show you.

04:58.723 --> 05:01.021
Espiritu Esa'ala.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.652
The mother of all caves.

05:03.728 --> 05:05.286
My God, Carl, it's...

05:05.363 --> 05:06.625
Yeah, it is.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.107
Focus on the dive.

05:23.181 --> 05:25.741
Focus on the dive.

05:25.817 --> 05:28.149
High oxygen.

05:28.219 --> 05:29.709
Diluent flush.

05:31.322 --> 05:33.381
Engage manual mode.

05:36.260 --> 05:37.887
Low oxygen.

05:40.665 --> 05:42.656
Bloody Josh.

05:45.103 --> 05:48.163
Got any coffee on the boil, George?

05:48.239 --> 05:51.436
Hey, Jude, I want you
on those pre-dive checks, please. Now.

05:51.509 --> 05:53.204
Right-o, George, okay.

05:53.277 --> 05:54.801
All good, Frank?

05:54.879 --> 05:56.574
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.512
Hey, J.D., you ginger bastard.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.517
Come over here and give Judes a hand
with the gear, will you?

06:00.585 --> 06:01.609
Yeah.

06:01.686 --> 06:03.244
George, we heard from Josh yet?

06:03.321 --> 06:04.379
Log this for me.

06:04.455 --> 06:06.423
No, no, not yet.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.958
Check it out.

06:09.560 --> 06:10.993
Where is Liz?

06:11.062 --> 06:13.257
She's still decompressing.

06:13.331 --> 06:14.457
The comms up yet?

06:14.532 --> 06:16.090
Comms are good.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.192
How was the dive, J.D.?

06:18.269 --> 06:19.759
-It's good visibility.
-Yeah?

06:19.837 --> 06:21.065
Yeah. It's a bit cold.

06:21.139 --> 06:24.472
Hey, can you give us a hand with the
re-breather? My legs are stuffed.

06:30.581 --> 06:32.310
You're getting old.

06:37.388 --> 06:39.117
Off you go, Virgil.

06:43.494 --> 06:44.984
How did Lizzy do?

06:45.062 --> 06:47.690
She was brilliant.
These new re-breathers work perfectly.

06:47.765 --> 06:48.891
Good.

06:51.402 --> 06:52.562
All set?

06:52.637 --> 06:54.867
Now lean forward for me a bit.

06:55.573 --> 06:57.040
That's it.

06:58.743 --> 07:00.608
That's the third time
you checked that gauge.

07:02.180 --> 07:05.149
George, I'm fine.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.150
Been a while since you saw daylight.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.844
Seventeen days.

07:16.027 --> 07:19.656
Anyone can call the dive at any time
for any reason. Yeah?

07:23.935 --> 07:24.959
You all set?

07:27.672 --> 07:28.764
Sure.

07:49.827 --> 07:51.454
So, what else is new, Luko?

07:51.529 --> 07:52.621
Luko.

07:58.569 --> 08:00.230
Carl! You're back.

08:08.179 --> 08:09.168
Kaboom!

08:12.316 --> 08:13.908
Why is that gear coming up?

08:13.985 --> 08:16.783
Well, there's a big storm building,
right off the coast.

08:17.922 --> 08:20.152
Frank said to haul out whatever
gear we're not using.

08:20.224 --> 08:21.748
Oh, he did, did he?

08:21.826 --> 08:23.157
Hurry up!

08:25.096 --> 08:28.532
Hey, Jim, this cave
is not going to beat me.

08:33.437 --> 08:34.768
You're in the doghouse, kid.

08:34.839 --> 08:35.965
Yeah, whatever.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.803
I'm surprised Dad
even noticed I was gone.

08:37.875 --> 08:39.672
When he and Judes
had to climb up to Camp Three

08:39.744 --> 08:42.212
for those bail-out tanks
you were supposed to bring down,

08:42.280 --> 08:43.371
he noticed.

08:43.714 --> 08:44.738
Shit.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.646
Yep! Sucks to be you.

08:46.717 --> 08:48.014
Bail-out?

08:48.085 --> 08:49.848
Uh, emergency tanks.

08:49.921 --> 08:51.081
See, they dive with re-breathers,

08:51.155 --> 08:53.316
but if something goes wrong
you need back-up.

08:53.524 --> 08:56.516
What could possibly go wrong,
diving in caves?

09:01.198 --> 09:03.792
Look at her. She's teasing.

09:03.868 --> 09:05.495
Nigh as she goes.

09:07.204 --> 09:09.468
Here. I can feel it.

09:09.540 --> 09:10.564
No.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.844
Virgil scanned that whole section.
There's bugger all.

09:13.911 --> 09:17.039
A machine can't feel the cave, George.

09:17.114 --> 09:19.082
Well, Obi-Wan,

09:19.150 --> 09:22.278
think you can find a way through,
you'd best do it fast.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.654
Two days, three at most,

09:24.722 --> 09:27.020
this whole place will be flooded
like a blocked dunny.

09:27.091 --> 09:29.787
Topside will give us plenty of warning.

09:46.877 --> 09:49.209
You guys from
the National Geographic, right?

09:49.280 --> 09:50.679
Yeah, good to see you.

09:50.748 --> 09:53.649
Hey, Victoria.
Hey, you've got to meet this guy.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.379
-Hurry up!
-Hey, Dex.

09:56.053 --> 09:58.613
I hope you're awake, bro,
you've got a visitor.

09:59.490 --> 10:00.582
Hey, man.

10:00.658 --> 10:02.649
Josh. Man, you're in the shit.

10:02.727 --> 10:03.887
Yeah, thanks.

10:03.961 --> 10:06.259
This is Victoria.
She's new, so give her the grand tour.

10:06.330 --> 10:07.888
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:07.965 --> 10:10.433
For you, only one dollar.

10:10.501 --> 10:12.526
Esa'ala Cave.

10:12.603 --> 10:16.630
The largest unexplored
cave system in the world.

10:16.707 --> 10:21.144
A million years of rainwater dissolving
its way down through the rock,

10:21.212 --> 10:23.680
trying to find its way to the sea.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.511
Which is, of course, why we're here.

10:25.583 --> 10:29.747
For no other reason than
to explore and find that hidden pathway.

10:30.488 --> 10:31.750
Wow, that's incredible.

10:32.223 --> 10:33.918
How far in have they got?

10:33.991 --> 10:36.289
A tour for the lady, is it?

10:36.360 --> 10:39.420
Sixteen caving personnel and 50 porters

10:39.497 --> 10:42.159
have hand-carried
nearly a ton of equipment

10:42.233 --> 10:45.396
almost 2 vertical kilometers
into the Earth's crust

10:45.469 --> 10:47.369
over a period of five weeks.

10:47.605 --> 10:51.006
Wow, now I know what Carl
has been spending all his cash on.

10:51.075 --> 10:53.441
Yep. Kicks for billionaires.

10:53.744 --> 10:55.041
That's so cool.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.739
Oh, it's pretty basic.

10:56.814 --> 11:00.045
I haven't finished yet,
but you get the general idea.

11:00.117 --> 11:01.812
Dex, you've been working
on this for five years.

11:01.886 --> 11:03.513
Yeah, four years. Yeah, four.

11:03.587 --> 11:05.578
I mean, the 3D is
a bit of a problem, that's all.

11:05.656 --> 11:07.590
Obviously, it hasn't
rendered properly yet,

11:07.658 --> 11:10.627
and the connection speeds up here
are just atrocious.

11:10.695 --> 11:12.788
That's not a wizard.

11:13.230 --> 11:17.257
And finally here we are, Forward Base.

11:17.334 --> 11:21.930
And somewhere under there, she goes.

11:24.742 --> 11:25.800
You need to talk to Judes.

11:26.343 --> 11:27.935
Her heart is not in the dive.

11:32.950 --> 11:35.475
You're kidding me. Now?

11:35.553 --> 11:38.545
I'm just telling you
what I see. She's tired.

11:50.901 --> 11:51.925
Rain?

11:52.002 --> 11:53.594
No, no. We're good for a few days.

11:53.671 --> 11:56.105
-Put Frank on.
-Yeah, I'll just get him.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.504
It's Carl.

11:57.575 --> 11:58.599
Ah.

11:59.009 --> 12:01.307
We're saved. Thank God.

12:02.413 --> 12:04.210
Frank, how are you doing, buddy?

12:04.281 --> 12:06.476
Nice of you to drop by, Carl.

12:07.818 --> 12:11.151
You know, some little bird told me
you were shutting up shop.

12:11.222 --> 12:13.417
Well, nice of you to ask the boss.

12:13.491 --> 12:14.890
You must've found a way through, huh?

12:15.126 --> 12:16.423
Well, you can ask me after the dive.

12:16.494 --> 12:18.485
Yeah, don't pull that
salty shit on me, Frank.

12:18.562 --> 12:20.359
-We're running out of time here.
-Exactly.

12:20.631 --> 12:23.099
And some of us have been
hauling equipment down here for weeks

12:23.167 --> 12:25.761
while you piss off back
to America and pick up your girlfriend.

12:25.836 --> 12:27.770
You know,
that's bullshit on so many levels,

12:27.838 --> 12:29.567
I'm not even going to address it.

12:29.640 --> 12:32.006
I've given you every piece
of equipment you've asked for.

12:32.076 --> 12:33.100
Spared no expense.

12:33.177 --> 12:35.407
I guess the cave
doesn't understand that, Carl.

12:35.479 --> 12:36.503
Frank!

12:39.150 --> 12:41.710
You know what? Check this out.

12:41.786 --> 12:42.810
Porfidio.

12:43.287 --> 12:45.983
Now, I'm going to haul this sucker down
2,000 vertical meters

12:46.056 --> 12:48.320
just to give you a shot,
because your ass is so tight

12:48.592 --> 12:51.186
when you fart only dogs can hear it.

12:56.801 --> 12:57.825
Right.

12:58.102 --> 12:59.865
Can you put Josh on?

13:01.238 --> 13:03.138
Josh. You're up, buddy.

13:04.775 --> 13:07.471
Nice work.
Biting the hand that feeds us.

13:08.179 --> 13:10.113
If that soft-cock wants
his name on this cave,

13:10.181 --> 13:12.979
he should be down here
getting his hands dirty.

13:14.885 --> 13:15.874
What?

13:16.086 --> 13:17.610
You're on my shitlist.

13:17.822 --> 13:20.484
We needed those
bail-out tanks down here, Josh.

13:20.558 --> 13:22.549
All right?
We rely on you to do your job.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.353
No, a job is something you choose to do,

13:25.429 --> 13:27.090
something you get paid to do.

13:27.398 --> 13:28.626
Stop treating me
like I'm five years old!

13:28.699 --> 13:31.065
Then stop acting like
you're five years old!

13:31.135 --> 13:34.798
Do you think this is some downhill ride
that you can just party...

13:39.543 --> 13:42.603
Frank, he was due for a break.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.272
Everybody is due for a break.

13:44.348 --> 13:46.043
I'm not going to give him
special treatment.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.515
You need to go easy on him.

13:47.585 --> 13:49.712
That's exactly what I don't need to do.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.483
This cave will kill you in a heartbeat.

13:57.528 --> 13:59.189
He's a good kid, Frank.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.192
Cut him some slack.

14:04.635 --> 14:08.298
All right, listen.
I want you to stay here.

14:08.906 --> 14:10.771
-I'm going to do this push on my own.
-No.

14:10.841 --> 14:12.832
No one dives alone. Let's go, J.D.

14:13.077 --> 14:15.443
Jude, I'm serious.

14:15.512 --> 14:20.609
Frank, I didn't come all this way
to sit here on the sideline and watch.

14:20.684 --> 14:23.209
No. Come on.

14:24.822 --> 14:27.347
Come on, are we going to do this,

14:27.424 --> 14:29.858
or we just going to talk about it?

14:39.436 --> 14:41.301
I can't even see the bottom.

14:41.372 --> 14:43.067
Trust me, you're going to love this.

14:44.708 --> 14:45.732
What next?

14:45.809 --> 14:48.039
Would you just relax?
I'm signing for you right now.

14:48.112 --> 14:49.204
Carl, are we doing this thing or what?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.441
You're going to get it in five minutes.
Just two seconds, thanks.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.278
I swear they would still manage
to find him on the moon.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.715
I don't understand what the problem is.

14:54.785 --> 14:56.514
I won't be back till the 13th.

14:56.921 --> 14:58.684
Look, deal with them, will you?

14:58.756 --> 15:01.316
Tell them I'm off the grid
until further notice.

15:01.392 --> 15:02.552
Below!

15:06.096 --> 15:07.154
Dealt with.

15:08.666 --> 15:11.396
Now, Josh, promise me
you won't let me fall.

15:12.169 --> 15:14.729
I promise.
Just feed it through the rack.

15:14.805 --> 15:16.830
Slow and steady like I showed you, okay?

15:16.907 --> 15:18.101
Okay. Okay, sure.

15:18.242 --> 15:20.437
Here we go. Here we go.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.891
I met her on my Everest expedition.

15:39.797 --> 15:42.322
Great. So she's even
crazier than you are.

15:42.399 --> 15:45.368
Yeah. I'm going to marry her one day.

15:45.936 --> 15:47.961
Life's not a dress rehearsal, Josh.

15:48.038 --> 15:49.403
You got to seize the day.

15:49.473 --> 15:52.067
50 bucks says
I'll reach the bottom before you.

15:52.142 --> 15:55.475
Oh, you are so about to get spanked.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.691
Unbelievable!

16:12.763 --> 16:14.253
Yeah, it's pretty cool, huh?

16:14.331 --> 16:16.595
Yeah. Amazing.

16:19.370 --> 16:22.533
Carl, Rawlinson again.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.733
Tell him he can kiss my ass.

16:31.048 --> 16:32.072
Wanker.

16:38.889 --> 16:40.083
Son of a bitch.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.837
Carl likes to play by his own rules.

17:09.053 --> 17:11.021
-You okay?
-Yep, all good.

17:11.088 --> 17:12.214
Okay.

17:16.894 --> 17:18.521
Good to go?

17:18.595 --> 17:20.256
Yeah, let's do it.

17:35.779 --> 17:37.269
See you later.

18:00.104 --> 18:02.971
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

18:04.041 --> 18:06.441
"A stately pleasure-dome decree

18:07.678 --> 18:10.738
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

18:11.982 --> 18:14.473
"Through caverns measureless to man

18:15.719 --> 18:18.051
"Down to a sunless sea"

18:24.561 --> 18:26.825
There once was a man from Nantucket

18:26.897 --> 18:28.194
whose head was the shape of a bucket.

18:29.366 --> 18:31.095
How are you traveling, George?
Are you with us?

18:31.468 --> 18:32.765
Roger that.

18:32.836 --> 18:34.360
I'm all over you, Judes.

18:34.438 --> 18:36.599
Yeah, you wish.

18:36.673 --> 18:38.231
Settle down, you two.

18:38.308 --> 18:40.401
Let's keep the comms clear.

18:42.412 --> 18:46.109
Yeah, well, let's keep
the poetry to a minimum, then, Frank.

18:49.052 --> 18:52.044
Are you good, Liz?
How long to decompress?

18:52.422 --> 18:55.186
All good. About 10 minutes.

18:55.893 --> 18:58.088
Well, I'll see you in a couple of hours.

19:06.904 --> 19:10.362
Age and treachery
will always overcome youth and skill.

19:11.008 --> 19:13.841
I think that's 50 bucks
you owe me, buddy.

19:22.519 --> 19:23.850
Saddle up.

19:24.521 --> 19:26.580
Okey-dokey. Let's do it.

19:31.195 --> 19:33.425
You're with me, Judes?

19:33.497 --> 19:35.829
I'm on your six, Red Dog Leader.

20:12.135 --> 20:14.194
-What? I can't see it.
-Don't worry about it.

20:14.304 --> 20:15.896
We're about 5 meters from the bottom.

20:15.973 --> 20:18.407
Just follow Josh's light.

20:26.783 --> 20:29.047
You're quite the rappel rat.

20:29.119 --> 20:32.145
Yeah, Dad gets me
every summer for a month.

20:32.222 --> 20:33.917
Lucky you.

20:33.991 --> 20:37.552
I've been dragged along
on these stupid expeditions all my life.

20:37.628 --> 20:40.620
See, it never occurs to him to ask
if I actually like caving.

20:40.697 --> 20:43.222
Yep, Josh is his own man.

20:43.300 --> 20:44.858
He doesn't take after his dad much.

20:44.935 --> 20:47.665
You mean I'm not an emotionally
shut-down Nazi asshole?

20:47.738 --> 20:51.674
True, but he is also the most
determined cave diver in the world.

20:51.742 --> 20:54.643
Yeah. That's because
he's got nothing else.

20:55.212 --> 20:56.406
Here you go.

21:00.550 --> 21:02.074
Whereabouts are they?

21:02.152 --> 21:03.585
Devil's Restriction.

21:04.621 --> 21:06.054
And let there be light.

21:09.693 --> 21:11.388
Let's put it down here and head on.

21:11.461 --> 21:12.519
Roger that.

21:12.863 --> 21:15.356
Hey, hey, hang on! Hang on!
Shit, my accelerator is stuck.

21:17.834 --> 21:19.199
Careful, Judes.

21:19.269 --> 21:21.863
Shit. Call the scuba police.

21:22.005 --> 21:23.992
Ouch. Drinks are on you tonight, Judes.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.606
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:25.676 --> 21:27.268
She's going to be pissed off about that.

21:27.844 --> 21:29.368
Hang on, Judes. Look at this.

21:29.446 --> 21:30.572
What is it?

21:30.647 --> 21:32.979
The silt is pulling
through here pretty fast.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.813
Looks interesting.

21:34.885 --> 21:36.045
Could be a squeeze.

21:42.626 --> 21:44.423
You getting this, George?

21:44.494 --> 21:46.724
Roger that. I'm all good.

21:50.801 --> 21:52.029
What you got there, Frank?

21:52.969 --> 21:54.630
I don't know.

21:54.705 --> 21:56.400
Let's take a peek.

22:05.982 --> 22:07.074
Hey, Vic.

22:07.150 --> 22:10.608
Get some B-roll
for the National Geographic, would you?

22:10.687 --> 22:12.120
Sure.

22:16.326 --> 22:17.793
So, Josh,

22:19.196 --> 22:20.561
do you like caving?

22:22.199 --> 22:25.293
My old man is obsessed
with torches, right?

22:26.636 --> 22:29.434
All cavers are. It's their thing.

22:29.506 --> 22:32.304
Check out what he got me
for my birthday.

22:34.177 --> 22:36.042
It's from a wild boar
that he killed by hand

22:36.113 --> 22:37.705
and ate on his expedition in Borneo.

22:37.781 --> 22:39.806
That's pretty cool, right?

22:40.817 --> 22:42.785
Wrong. He modified it.

22:43.353 --> 22:45.412
Kills this wild boar, eats it,

22:45.489 --> 22:47.184
and then turns it into a torch.

22:47.557 --> 22:49.115
Oh, wow, that's so cool.

22:49.192 --> 22:53.060
No, it's not cool.
That is a caver for you.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.257
They're all, like, "Whoa, I get to
be the first person to check out

22:55.332 --> 22:58.961
"some awesome bit of rock
that looks just like the last 10 miles

22:59.035 --> 23:00.662
"of pointless rock."

23:00.737 --> 23:02.329
It's so lame.

23:02.406 --> 23:03.737
Josh.

23:03.807 --> 23:05.206
You just don't get it, do you?

23:05.842 --> 23:06.900
Your old man,

23:06.977 --> 23:10.936
he's the most respected
explorer of our time.

23:11.114 --> 23:15.073
He's like a Columbus, or Neil Armstrong.

23:16.420 --> 23:20.151
And these rocks, these caves,

23:21.191 --> 23:22.783
man, this is it.

23:24.261 --> 23:27.253
There is nowhere else left
on the planet to explore.

23:28.165 --> 23:31.498
I mean, where else can you shine a light
where no human has been before, huh?

23:31.835 --> 23:34.804
You want to shine a light
where no human has ever been before?

23:35.272 --> 23:36.330
Here you go.

23:41.578 --> 23:43.136
I haven't done this for a while.

23:44.581 --> 23:46.572
Finally some excitement.

23:55.058 --> 23:57.151
He's going in without bail-out.

23:57.227 --> 23:58.524
He's keen.

23:58.595 --> 24:00.495
Jesus, Frank. Just leave it.

24:00.997 --> 24:03.158
That hole is tighter than a nun's nasty.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.565
You sure you're up for this, Frank?

24:05.635 --> 24:07.034
You don't have to come, Judes.

24:07.103 --> 24:08.331
Yeah, right.

24:08.405 --> 24:11.340
Plan the dive and dive the plan, Judes.

24:11.408 --> 24:12.841
Go fuck yourself, George.

24:15.512 --> 24:17.104
That hole looks pretty tight, Judes.

24:17.180 --> 24:18.613
Hope that diet is working for you.

24:34.030 --> 24:35.998
I'm going in after them.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.198
Jesus, Frank.

24:51.381 --> 24:53.542
This is starting to get sporting.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.982
No shit.

24:58.889 --> 25:00.049
The re-breather is stuck.

25:03.159 --> 25:04.820
My hose is caught.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.729
I'm wedged.

25:07.797 --> 25:09.560
Frank! Frank, I'm wedged.

25:09.633 --> 25:10.691
It's stuck.

25:10.767 --> 25:12.428
Judes, stay cool.

25:12.502 --> 25:14.094
Deep and slow, Judes.

25:14.170 --> 25:16.400
Panic's the vulture,
sits on your shoulder.

25:16.473 --> 25:17.997
There is always slack somewhere.

25:21.444 --> 25:22.911
It's cool. I've got it.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.003
Roger.

25:25.248 --> 25:26.579
Good girl.

26:05.221 --> 26:07.781
My God! Would you look at that?

26:16.166 --> 26:19.192
He did it. He finally fucking did it.

26:19.269 --> 26:23.262
Frank, you are one stubborn son
of a bitch. Look at that.

26:23.974 --> 26:26.067
Since the beginning of time,

26:26.476 --> 26:29.377
no human being has ever seen this.

26:31.014 --> 26:32.379
Look at it.

26:32.849 --> 26:34.714
It's like a cathedral.

26:35.518 --> 26:37.418
St. Judes' Cathedral.

26:38.989 --> 26:40.354
Damn right.

26:42.192 --> 26:44.422
There is an air bell up there.

26:44.661 --> 26:46.390
About 100 feet up.

26:46.463 --> 26:48.055
A big air bell.

26:48.131 --> 26:50.656
George, you've got to see this.

26:52.636 --> 26:55.662
There's got to be a whole
new cave system up there.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.331
I can feel it.

26:57.407 --> 26:58.567
Wow.

26:58.842 --> 27:00.173
Wow.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.642
Wow.

27:03.980 --> 27:06.414
Do you want to go up and have a look?

27:06.483 --> 27:08.678
You want to spend
two hours decompressing?

27:09.386 --> 27:12.253
Let's leave something for Carl.

27:12.322 --> 27:13.448
Okay.

27:16.459 --> 27:18.086
All right, George, we're winding it up.

27:18.161 --> 27:19.185
Roger that.

27:19.262 --> 27:20.820
You've done really good.

27:21.064 --> 27:24.056
We'll have a nice hot cup of tea
ready for you when you get back.

27:26.736 --> 27:28.761
Hey, you've got a bit of a leak.

27:29.072 --> 27:30.130
Let me take a look.

27:30.607 --> 27:32.575
What do you mean? Where?

27:32.642 --> 27:33.666
Christ.

27:34.678 --> 27:36.669
Shit. Judes, hold still.

27:36.746 --> 27:38.043
Going for the bail-out, Frank.

27:38.114 --> 27:40.344
Hold still! I've got you. I've got you.

27:40.417 --> 27:41.441
Frank, my bail-out.

27:41.985 --> 27:44.010
Stay with me. Let me take a look.

27:44.087 --> 27:45.714
Get me to the air bell, Frank.
Get me to the air bell.

27:45.789 --> 27:47.882
Judes, it's too far.
We'll never make it. You'll get bent.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.619
Come on, Frank. Come on, Frank,
get me to the air bell.

27:50.694 --> 27:52.719
-Judes, it's too far.
-Jesus, fuck!

27:52.796 --> 27:53.991
She's got no bail-out!

27:54.065 --> 27:56.033
I'm flooding.

27:56.100 --> 27:58.728
Stay calm. We're going to buddy-breathe.

27:58.803 --> 28:00.737
We're going to buddy breathe, all right?

28:00.805 --> 28:02.136
Mask, off.

28:04.742 --> 28:07.108
Frank, don't do it!
We're going to lose you both.

28:36.907 --> 28:38.431
Frank. No, no!

28:38.776 --> 28:42.075
No. No, Frank. No, no. No, Frank.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.343
No, Frank! No!

29:18.015 --> 29:19.277
Oh, man.

29:22.453 --> 29:23.545
Fuck.

30:01.625 --> 30:04.788
See? He just fucking yanks
the mask away from her.

30:04.862 --> 30:06.762
I don't see it that way, Josh.

30:06.831 --> 30:09.322
Hey! Hey, Josh,
you've got no fucking idea

30:09.400 --> 30:10.662
what you're talking about.
No, he killed her!

30:10.734 --> 30:12.031
That's bullshit! That's bullshit!

30:12.102 --> 30:13.228
She is dead, and it's because of him.

30:13.304 --> 30:14.430
Listen to me! Listen to me!

30:14.505 --> 30:16.769
-Listen to me! Listen to me!
-Fuck off!

30:16.841 --> 30:19.674
Buddy-breathing with a full-face mask
is the most radical thing

30:19.743 --> 30:21.472
you can possibly do underwater.

30:21.545 --> 30:22.910
He was insane to even try it.

30:22.980 --> 30:24.538
It was the most
heroic goddamn thing I've ever seen.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.515
-No, that's bullshit! Bullshit!
-Listen to me.

30:26.584 --> 30:28.347
This wasn't a case of him or her, Josh.

30:28.419 --> 30:31.980
This was about there being
one body down there or two.

30:32.056 --> 30:33.921
Once Jude lost it, there was...

30:33.991 --> 30:36.619
She was gone. She wasn't coming home.

30:36.694 --> 30:39.322
Frank had no right taking her
through there without bail-out tanks.

30:39.430 --> 30:40.692
Surely that was her choice.

30:41.065 --> 30:42.532
-Every fiber...
-This is all bullshit!

30:42.600 --> 30:45.569
...of Jude's being
was driven to explore.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.365
Frank didn't force her to do anything.

30:48.005 --> 30:49.666
No.

30:49.740 --> 30:52.300
No, he always pushes too hard.

30:52.376 --> 30:53.400
Josh, no.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.411
He made this happen.

30:55.479 --> 30:57.947
Does somebody want to
give me a hand here?

31:05.756 --> 31:08.919
Get her wrapped up
and ready to haul out of here.

31:12.363 --> 31:15.264
Forward Base, Forward Base,
do you copy?

31:15.332 --> 31:17.926
If you can hear me,
the storm is right on top of us.

31:18.002 --> 31:20.027
No, it's blowing straight
in from the coast.

31:20.471 --> 31:23.338
God damn it, Frank! Pick up!

31:23.407 --> 31:25.307
Frank, can you hear me?

31:27.978 --> 31:30.469
Have you got through to Jim
on the surface yet?

31:30.547 --> 31:32.845
The comms are down.

31:32.917 --> 31:35.909
It's probably the fiber connector
at Camp Three.

31:35.986 --> 31:38.511
This is Camp Four to Surface Base,
come in.

31:38.589 --> 31:40.887
What would you do?

31:40.958 --> 31:43.051
On the mountain?

31:43.127 --> 31:48.155
Camp Four to Surface Base, come in.
Jim, do you read me?

31:48.232 --> 31:51.531
There is nothing can be done
for the dead at altitude.

31:51.602 --> 31:54.537
If I were on the mountain,
I'd keep going.

31:55.806 --> 31:57.398
Damn it.

32:21.966 --> 32:24.628
Judes knew the risks better than anyone.

32:27.371 --> 32:31.603
You drag everyone along
on your big dream

32:32.676 --> 32:34.007
and they listen to you,
and they believe you,

32:34.078 --> 32:37.479
and then they wind up down here,
fucking dead.

32:37.548 --> 32:40.312
God, it's a sphincter of rock, Dad.
Nobody cares.

32:40.384 --> 32:41.646
-People care.
-No, they don't!

32:41.719 --> 32:43.914
-Judes cared.
-Nobody out there in the real world

32:43.988 --> 32:47.082
gives two shits about this fucking cave!

32:47.157 --> 32:49.785
Those bail-out tanks you were supposed
to bring down,

32:50.294 --> 32:53.388
Judes and I had
to climb back up and get them.

32:53.464 --> 32:55.523
Judes started the dive heavily fatigued

32:55.599 --> 32:57.499
with a couple of hours
sleep under her belt.

32:58.769 --> 33:00.999
Now maybe that didn't
make any difference,

33:01.372 --> 33:02.999
but maybe it did.

33:05.676 --> 33:07.439
Want to think about that?

33:11.782 --> 33:12.874
All right, the comms are down.

33:13.283 --> 33:16.013
J.D., Liz, I want you to head back up.

33:16.086 --> 33:17.951
Let everyone know we're coming out.

33:18.822 --> 33:20.790
We're going to need all hands down here
in the morning

33:20.858 --> 33:22.223
to haul the rest of the gear out.

33:22.292 --> 33:23.953
Okay, J.D., I'll prep the rigs.

33:24.028 --> 33:25.290
I'm going with them.

33:25.362 --> 33:26.556
Yeah, that's right. You go.

33:26.630 --> 33:29.360
And when you get up there,
find that chopper and keep going.

33:29.433 --> 33:30.695
Fine!

33:30.768 --> 33:32.827
Jesus Christ, Frank.
Give the kid a break, would you?

33:33.137 --> 33:34.900
I suggest you keep out of this!

33:38.242 --> 33:39.300
Hey.

33:45.315 --> 33:46.646
All right.

33:47.584 --> 33:49.176
Yes, okay.

33:49.253 --> 33:51.448
You go. Thank you, Luko.

33:52.623 --> 33:54.181
Don't worry about it. I got this.

33:54.258 --> 33:55.748
What is it with this guy?
You're his boss.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.588
Let me talk to him.

34:38.168 --> 34:39.429
Stop!

34:42.139 --> 34:43.333
Listen.

34:54.184 --> 34:55.844
What the hell was that?

34:55.918 --> 34:57.784
We better keep moving.

35:26.517 --> 35:28.485
I wonder where it leads.

35:31.989 --> 35:35.891
We could always go and check it out
first thing in the morning.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.157
Just you and me, Frank. What do you say?

35:42.032 --> 35:43.897
Liz, get up there.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.093
Okay.

35:45.169 --> 35:46.329
I'm going to call Surface Base.

35:46.403 --> 35:47.461
Liz, get up there.

35:47.538 --> 35:48.698
I'm coming.

35:52.276 --> 35:54.073
What the fuck is that?

35:54.144 --> 35:55.702
The river. Surface Base.

35:55.812 --> 35:57.837
-It is returning.
-Surface Base, do you copy?

35:57.915 --> 35:59.473
-Get on the ropes.
-Can you hear me? Hello?

35:59.550 --> 36:01.040
-Liz, come on!
-Can you hear me?

36:01.118 --> 36:02.380
-Hang on.
-Get it in there.

36:02.452 --> 36:04.044
-Got it!
-Forward Base! Dad?

36:04.121 --> 36:05.488
-Dad, can you hear...
-Josh!

36:05.656 --> 36:07.351
Up, good. Down, bad.

36:07.424 --> 36:09.324
-Surface Base, do you copy?
-Quick as you can!

36:09.393 --> 36:11.793
Surface Base, come in. Hello?
Can you hear me?

36:12.162 --> 36:13.151
Shit.

36:13.230 --> 36:14.959
-Josh, is that you?
-Jim.

36:15.032 --> 36:17.125
Jim. We're at Junction Three!
What's going on?

36:17.201 --> 36:20.398
Thank Christ! Look,
you've got to pull the team out now!

36:20.470 --> 36:22.404
The storm has turned into a cyclone.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.064
No, no, no, no!
The others are still down there.

36:24.141 --> 36:25.165
The comms are down!

36:25.242 --> 36:26.971
Josh, get out of there now!

36:27.044 --> 36:28.739
Repeat! Get out, mate! Get out now!

36:29.546 --> 36:31.013
Fuck!

36:31.081 --> 36:33.015
Josh, do you copy?

36:33.083 --> 36:34.641
What the hell is happening?

36:34.718 --> 36:35.810
Hurry up!

36:35.886 --> 36:37.183
What about Dad and the others?

36:37.254 --> 36:38.744
We can't help them from here!

36:38.822 --> 36:41.848
We got to get back to the surface.
Organize a rescue!

36:41.925 --> 36:45.122
A rescue? No, we can't just
leave them down there!

37:08.619 --> 37:09.916
Liz!

37:12.556 --> 37:14.046
J.D., help me!

37:17.894 --> 37:19.020
Liz!

37:20.931 --> 37:22.523
I think it's stopping!

37:25.869 --> 37:27.996
Liz, are you all right?

37:29.406 --> 37:30.634
I'm okay!

37:30.974 --> 37:32.942
There is a break in the flow!

37:33.010 --> 37:35.376
We have to get out of here. Now!

37:37.314 --> 37:38.645
Where's Carl?

37:38.715 --> 37:40.307
What's going on?

37:45.956 --> 37:47.048
We got to get out of here.

37:47.424 --> 37:48.584
Yeah.

37:49.393 --> 37:50.860
Where's Carl?

37:51.995 --> 37:53.360
Come on, Josh!

37:53.430 --> 37:55.022
What the hell is going on?

37:55.098 --> 37:57.931
-Hurry.
-Josh, what the fuck are you doing?

37:58.001 --> 37:59.059
Get up here!

37:59.403 --> 38:01.598
Come on! Get on the rope!

38:02.839 --> 38:03.897
I can't.

38:03.974 --> 38:05.464
Josh, hurry up!

38:05.542 --> 38:07.601
I can't leave them.

38:07.678 --> 38:09.043
Hurry, Josh!

38:15.952 --> 38:17.579
Oh, shit!

38:17.654 --> 38:19.679
Josh!

38:19.756 --> 38:22.247
Get up here, now!

38:22.326 --> 38:24.226
They're gone. Let's go.

38:31.868 --> 38:32.857
Whoo!

38:35.372 --> 38:38.364
Man, that was great. What?

39:27.858 --> 39:29.587
We'll never make that!

39:30.627 --> 39:31.992
Frank!

39:32.462 --> 39:34.487
Get Victoria on that ladder.

39:40.137 --> 39:43.004
Coming up behind you, Frank.

39:43.073 --> 39:44.097
Watch yourself.

40:01.925 --> 40:02.949
Frank!

40:03.260 --> 40:04.488
Who's there?

40:05.562 --> 40:06.688
Dad?

40:06.763 --> 40:08.424
Joshua!

40:08.498 --> 40:10.295
What the fuck are you doing here?

40:11.334 --> 40:12.392
Dad.

40:13.970 --> 40:15.562
The cave is flooding!

40:15.906 --> 40:16.930
Do you think?

40:17.507 --> 40:18.735
Listen to me.

40:18.809 --> 40:20.674
We need a belay! Can you do that?

40:21.011 --> 40:22.376
Yeah, yeah.

40:26.116 --> 40:27.811
-Secure?
-Yeah.

40:32.088 --> 40:33.646
Quick, grab the line!

40:33.723 --> 40:35.122
Clip it on!

40:45.435 --> 40:47.096
Nice and tight! That's it!

40:47.170 --> 40:48.831
-You're safe, let's go! Let's go!
-Okay.

40:49.973 --> 40:51.907
Okay. Pull it.

40:52.576 --> 40:53.702
Go, go.

40:57.180 --> 41:00.013
That's it, one step at a time!
You got it.

41:01.718 --> 41:02.980
She's climbing!

41:05.489 --> 41:07.423
Nice and easy.

41:11.094 --> 41:12.721
Go, baby! Go!

41:18.001 --> 41:19.866
You're doing great!

41:19.936 --> 41:21.369
Keep fighting, Vic!

41:21.438 --> 41:22.666
Come on!

41:24.441 --> 41:26.170
Take the weight!

41:28.311 --> 41:29.335
Keep coming.

41:29.746 --> 41:30.872
Come on!

41:30.947 --> 41:32.414
Keep moving!

41:36.319 --> 41:38.310
That's it! You got it!

41:48.765 --> 41:51.757
Victoria, you're going
to take a big hit now.

41:52.502 --> 41:53.696
Ready yourself!

41:53.803 --> 41:55.134
You'll be all right.

41:55.539 --> 41:56.597
Go, baby!

41:58.141 --> 42:00.609
That's it! Keep going!

42:07.017 --> 42:08.075
That's it!

42:08.151 --> 42:09.140
You're going great.

42:13.189 --> 42:14.622
Stop!

42:14.691 --> 42:16.090
Stop! It's moving!

42:18.728 --> 42:19.820
Go back down!

42:20.196 --> 42:21.220
Fuck that.

42:27.871 --> 42:28.929
-You all right?
-Yeah.

42:29.005 --> 42:30.495
Hold on, okay?

42:35.245 --> 42:36.269
Vic!

42:37.247 --> 42:38.305
Josh!

42:38.949 --> 42:41.417
Joshua! Where are you?

42:41.651 --> 42:43.346
Oh, my God!

42:43.420 --> 42:45.081
Vic!

42:48.058 --> 42:51.186
Jesus Christ, Vic! You good? Vic?

42:51.494 --> 42:52.518
Jesus.

42:58.635 --> 42:59.693
No!

43:01.037 --> 43:02.595
No! No!

43:03.239 --> 43:04.365
Christ.

43:04.441 --> 43:05.567
Joshua!

43:05.809 --> 43:08.175
Luko! Get Luko!

43:10.447 --> 43:13.109
Luko! Luko!

43:13.984 --> 43:15.110
Vic, talk to me.

43:15.185 --> 43:17.050
-You good? You good?
-Yeah, I'm all right.

43:20.023 --> 43:21.115
Luko!

43:23.493 --> 43:25.120
George, let's go.

43:27.230 --> 43:28.754
Watch that torrent!

43:28.832 --> 43:30.129
Carl.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.660
Luko!

43:40.710 --> 43:42.871
Josh! Come on, get out of there!

43:45.815 --> 43:47.476
Josh! Leave him!

43:51.821 --> 43:53.152
Leave him!

44:02.098 --> 44:04.828
You did everything you could, all right?

44:07.971 --> 44:10.269
Frank, the exit! Shit!

44:16.579 --> 44:19.673
We're heading back down to Forward Base!

44:19.749 --> 44:21.580
We've got to find another way out!

44:23.119 --> 44:25.087
Through the Restriction.

44:33.329 --> 44:35.889
Grab anything you see that's useful!

44:38.168 --> 44:39.533
I said useful!

44:39.903 --> 44:43.669
Ropes, batteries, re-breathers.

44:44.340 --> 44:46.604
We've got a few hours
before this place is underwater.

44:48.478 --> 44:51.538
Frank, what if the air bell
through the Restriction is flooded?

44:51.614 --> 44:53.878
Maybe we should
send the ROV through to check it out.

44:53.950 --> 44:55.679
It won't be flooded.

44:57.020 --> 44:58.612
Jesus, George. What if he's wrong?

44:59.189 --> 45:02.181
Then we should all
start growing gills, mate.

45:03.259 --> 45:07.025
This isn't my mask.
Where's my mask? God damn it!

45:07.731 --> 45:10.427
Just bring those two
re-breathers over here.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.497
George, give me a hand!

45:24.347 --> 45:25.780
What the fuck are you doing?

45:25.849 --> 45:28.113
Without a suit, you'll go hypothermic.

45:28.184 --> 45:29.913
This is the only one that will fit you.

45:30.787 --> 45:33.415
Fuck that. I can't even dive.

45:33.490 --> 45:35.617
I can't do this, any of this.

45:35.692 --> 45:38.183
You can do this because you have
to do this! All right?

45:39.129 --> 45:40.391
You can swim, can't you?

45:42.165 --> 45:44.224
You can breathe? Then you can dive.

45:44.300 --> 45:45.824
George will be with you all the way.

45:45.902 --> 45:46.926
You'll be all right.

45:47.003 --> 45:48.766
I thought George couldn't dive anymore.

45:50.273 --> 45:51.740
We're taking him out of retirement.

45:51.808 --> 45:52.832
Okay.

45:52.909 --> 45:55.537
Okay, well, prioritize, Frank.

45:55.845 --> 45:57.142
There's no time to take off her suit.

45:57.213 --> 45:59.204
You have to show me
how to use the re-breather.

45:59.282 --> 46:00.306
Listen to me!

46:00.383 --> 46:01.509
No, you listen to me, Frank.

46:01.584 --> 46:03.779
I'd rather be cold
and alive than warm and dead!

46:03.853 --> 46:05.150
So, show me what to do!

46:05.221 --> 46:06.552
You will need this!

46:06.623 --> 46:09.456
I'm fine in this, Frank!
Show me what to do!

46:09.559 --> 46:12.619
Because I am not wearing the wetsuit
of a dead person!

46:21.271 --> 46:22.795
Get her a mask.

46:29.245 --> 46:32.237
First rule of diving,
never hold your breath.

46:32.582 --> 46:33.844
Yes?

46:33.917 --> 46:36.249
You were bent before,
bad, in Mexico, right?

46:36.319 --> 46:39.413
Mexico? Fucking Malaysia.

46:39.489 --> 46:41.787
Mexico is where I got the clap.

46:50.033 --> 46:51.625
Dad. Dad!

46:53.203 --> 46:55.171
Bring the medical kit. It's Luko.

46:55.872 --> 46:57.669
I'll get it, Frank. You go.

47:05.915 --> 47:07.542
He's still alive!

47:09.886 --> 47:12.081
Josh, is he okay?

47:12.155 --> 47:14.248
George, do we have morphine?

47:15.124 --> 47:16.489
No. Nothing.

47:16.559 --> 47:17.583
How bad is it?

47:20.129 --> 47:22.154
George, take Josh away.

47:22.232 --> 47:23.426
What are you going to do?

47:23.499 --> 47:24.625
There's nothing we can do.

47:24.968 --> 47:26.492
What do you mean?
You have to do something.

47:26.569 --> 47:29.595
Josh, he's broken every bone
in his body, all right?

47:29.706 --> 47:31.173
He can't hold a reg in his mouth.

47:31.241 --> 47:32.503
You can't just leave him here to die.

47:32.575 --> 47:34.236
I don't intend to.

47:35.478 --> 47:39.778
No, no, no!
You have no right to do this!

47:39.849 --> 47:42.283
You people have no idea, do you?

47:42.352 --> 47:44.217
You have no idea!

47:44.287 --> 47:46.278
You spend your lives
wrapped in cotton wool.

47:46.356 --> 47:48.187
You want to play at being adventurers?

47:48.958 --> 47:50.152
Well, this is it.

47:50.226 --> 47:53.753
Okay. Come on, Vic. Come on.

47:55.798 --> 47:56.890
George.

47:58.034 --> 48:00.525
Come on, mate. It's all right.

48:04.974 --> 48:07.966
It's all right, my friend. Yeah.

49:08.571 --> 49:09.970
How's it look down there?

49:11.708 --> 49:12.834
Walk in the park.

49:12.909 --> 49:14.536
I'm closing the valve now, all right?

49:15.578 --> 49:18.103
When you take it off,
it stays closed, yes?

49:18.181 --> 49:19.705
Come here, you.

49:22.018 --> 49:23.212
Okay.

49:25.822 --> 49:28.620
You stay on the guideline, all right?

49:28.691 --> 49:31.683
And don't let go of it.
And remember how to clear your mask?

49:31.761 --> 49:34.252
Yeah. Yeah, Carl's taken me
through this all again.

49:34.497 --> 49:36.590
Good. Well, now you
get to hear it twice.

49:36.666 --> 49:38.600
Keep the mouthpiece
in or close the valve.

49:38.924 --> 49:41.051
If you flood the breathing loop,
it's all over.

49:41.126 --> 49:44.892
We'll have over an hour of decompression
stops before we can surface.

49:44.963 --> 49:47.523
Remember what Frank told you
about decompression sickness?

49:47.599 --> 49:49.032
The bends, right.
If you get bent down there,

49:49.101 --> 49:51.035
it's going to ruin your
whole day, believe me.

49:51.103 --> 49:54.300
Green light is good, red light is bad.

49:54.373 --> 49:56.102
I'll monitor your PPO2.

49:56.174 --> 49:58.165
Dad, I get it. Okay?

50:00.045 --> 50:01.069
All right.

50:01.146 --> 50:02.807
Stay at the same depth as me,

50:02.881 --> 50:05.441
or your blood is going to fizz up
like a dropped can of beer.

50:06.151 --> 50:07.277
Nice.

50:08.487 --> 50:10.580
All right, listen up.

50:10.656 --> 50:13.420
Visibility is going
to be stirred to shit,

50:13.492 --> 50:15.585
so stay on the guideline at all times.

50:15.794 --> 50:17.091
I'll bring up the rear.

50:17.162 --> 50:19.722
Victoria is the last one
through that restriction.

50:21.266 --> 50:22.290
What?

50:22.367 --> 50:26.201
You panic in that squeeze,
anyone behind you is dead.

50:29.841 --> 50:31.399
You'll be fine.

50:31.476 --> 50:33.774
I'll see you on the other side.

50:34.579 --> 50:36.945
Could have picked
a better choice of words.

56:09.914 --> 56:11.575
Where's Carl?

56:12.283 --> 56:13.580
Where's Carl?

56:13.652 --> 56:16.746
We've got to raise her body temperature.
She's hypothermic.

56:16.821 --> 56:18.721
-Josh, get the space blanket.
-Yeah.

56:18.790 --> 56:20.052
Cross your arms. Cross your arms.

56:20.158 --> 56:21.147
Carl!

56:21.226 --> 56:24.354
Get here and get your kit off.
You're going to be under here with her.

56:24.729 --> 56:26.720
Come on, get a move on!

56:29.267 --> 56:31.792
George, get on oxygen.

56:31.870 --> 56:32.894
No, I'm fine.

56:32.971 --> 56:34.939
Get on oxygen.

56:35.206 --> 56:36.332
It's okay, babe, I'm coming.

56:36.408 --> 56:37.773
Josh, where's that blanket?

56:38.109 --> 56:39.701
Got it. Got it. Here you go.

56:41.413 --> 56:42.846
Okay, here it comes.

56:42.914 --> 56:44.745
It's okay, I got her.

56:50.822 --> 56:54.485
There you go. Baby,
you're going to be okay.

56:54.559 --> 56:57.084
Any chance you get, hey, babe?

56:59.431 --> 57:01.422
Come here, you.

57:07.305 --> 57:10.138
You're no use to me
if you fizz up again.

57:18.616 --> 57:21.744
All right, if we run out of light,
we run out of time.

57:21.820 --> 57:24.152
Conserve your batteries,

57:24.222 --> 57:26.156
and get some rest.

57:39.337 --> 57:41.430
Still can't feel my feet.

57:45.243 --> 57:46.938
I told you we'd take care of you, right?

57:47.946 --> 57:50.278
Yeah, fun times.

57:57.155 --> 57:58.349
Dad?

58:01.793 --> 58:03.317
I should have worn her suit.

58:03.394 --> 58:05.589
Hey, you did great.

58:06.931 --> 58:08.398
You're alive.

58:11.369 --> 58:13.735
You understand, no matter what happens,

58:13.805 --> 58:16.899
you never, ever give up.

58:17.242 --> 58:18.641
Hey, Frank,

58:18.877 --> 58:21.345
we should explore this section while
we're waiting.

58:21.579 --> 58:23.877
Might be a way out.

58:23.948 --> 58:25.176
Waiting for what?

58:25.817 --> 58:28.377
Waiting for the rescue party.

58:29.654 --> 58:32.817
There are no rescues down here.

58:32.891 --> 58:34.256
Only body recoveries.

58:35.160 --> 58:36.149
What?

58:36.227 --> 58:38.354
Everyone up there
already thinks we're dead.

58:38.763 --> 58:40.162
Don't worry about it.

58:42.901 --> 58:44.334
He's fine.

58:47.205 --> 58:48.263
You all right?

58:49.040 --> 58:51.133
-I'm all right.
-Yeah?

58:51.209 --> 58:53.234
Just taking a leak.

58:58.550 --> 59:00.142
And there she goes.

59:00.418 --> 59:02.477
No, I'm all right.

59:02.821 --> 59:04.812
I still think we should sit and wait.

59:05.657 --> 59:08.125
Yeah, we've got enough food
for the next couple of days.

59:08.193 --> 59:10.923
Couple of days,
this cave's going to be underwater.

59:11.462 --> 59:13.396
Understood?

59:13.498 --> 59:16.934
We follow the river
and get to the ocean.

01:00:17.996 --> 01:00:20.089
Okay, this way.

01:00:20.265 --> 01:00:21.254
Are you sure?

01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:23.128
Nope.

01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:26.897
Come on.

01:00:35.146 --> 01:00:37.637
Hey, George. You all right?

01:00:40.919 --> 01:00:42.853
I'm fine.

01:00:42.921 --> 01:00:45.185
You go on up ahead.

01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:11.208
George!

01:01:17.121 --> 01:01:18.179
You all right?

01:01:24.095 --> 01:01:25.153
Hey,

01:01:26.164 --> 01:01:28.724
did I ever tell you about the time
your dad really fucked up?

01:01:30.068 --> 01:01:31.467
No.

01:01:34.305 --> 01:01:38.639
We were checking out this cave
on the Nullarbor we had found,

01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:41.611
and there is nothing out there
as far as the eye can see.

01:01:41.679 --> 01:01:45.080
Just this bloody great big hole
at the arse end of nowhere.

01:01:46.851 --> 01:01:50.582
So, Frank backs the truck up
to the edge of it,

01:01:50.655 --> 01:01:53.624
so we can tie off the guideline. Right?

01:01:53.791 --> 01:01:54.815
Right.

01:01:54.892 --> 01:01:57.417
So, we do the dive,

01:01:57.495 --> 01:01:59.588
we're swimming back out,

01:01:59.664 --> 01:02:02.690
when suddenly there's a vehicle
blocking the entrance,

01:02:02.767 --> 01:02:04.132
60 feet underwater.

01:02:05.370 --> 01:02:06.894
I'm thinking,

01:02:07.705 --> 01:02:11.505
"Shit,
that license plate looks familiar."

01:02:15.313 --> 01:02:17.941
He'd gone and left the handbrake off,

01:02:18.016 --> 01:02:19.745
dumb son of a bitch!

01:02:19.817 --> 01:02:23.218
And pulled his truck
back into the cave with us.

01:02:24.756 --> 01:02:28.089
We had to smash open the back window
just so we could swim out.

01:02:29.494 --> 01:02:30.483
Then,

01:02:31.429 --> 01:02:35.923
the poor bastard had to walk 20 miles
in the desert.

01:02:36.367 --> 01:02:39.131
Twenty miles just to go get some help.

01:02:47.245 --> 01:02:50.703
He's a hell of a fella, your old man.

01:02:50.782 --> 01:02:52.306
Once you get to know him.

01:02:54.819 --> 01:02:56.184
Now,

01:02:56.587 --> 01:02:58.521
haul this thing for me a little while.

01:02:58.923 --> 01:03:01.915
I just need to catch my breath.

01:03:03.961 --> 01:03:05.292
Go on.

01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:10.294
Go on.

01:03:30.121 --> 01:03:31.213
Fuck.

01:03:34.358 --> 01:03:36.258
Yep.

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:37.316
Yep.

01:03:48.406 --> 01:03:49.964
How you holding up?

01:03:50.041 --> 01:03:52.566
Hot bath and a brandy and I'll be fine.

01:03:53.711 --> 01:03:56.680
Carl, we'll take a break
once we hit the top, all right?

01:03:56.747 --> 01:03:58.806
Sounds good.

01:03:58.883 --> 01:04:00.248
Where's George?

01:04:00.751 --> 01:04:02.082
He's...

01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:04.818
He's back there somewhere,
taking a break.

01:04:04.889 --> 01:04:06.049
He said he'd catch up with us.

01:04:06.124 --> 01:04:07.591
George!

01:04:11.195 --> 01:04:12.492
George?

01:04:14.432 --> 01:04:16.229
-George?
-Dad, what's going on?

01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.767
Where did you see him last?

01:04:18.503 --> 01:04:19.697
I don't know, we were...

01:04:19.770 --> 01:04:21.670
Where? He's got the bends.

01:04:21.739 --> 01:04:23.001
He doesn't want to slow us down.

01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:24.765
There. His re-breather.

01:04:28.012 --> 01:04:29.343
George!

01:04:29.413 --> 01:04:31.313
I know what you're doing.

01:04:31.382 --> 01:04:34.112
George, where are you?

01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:37.717
George!

01:04:37.788 --> 01:04:39.187
Jesus.

01:04:39.257 --> 01:04:40.724
Dad.

01:04:41.759 --> 01:04:42.783
Christ.

01:04:45.329 --> 01:04:47.524
George, where are you?

01:04:48.399 --> 01:04:52.597
Damn it. George!
You don't have to do this.

01:04:55.706 --> 01:04:57.469
George!

01:05:00.178 --> 01:05:02.373
George, where are you?

01:05:19.397 --> 01:05:21.160
Turn that light off.

01:05:24.669 --> 01:05:28.105
Come on, Josh, we'll make the cover
of National Geographic yet.

01:05:28.773 --> 01:05:31.708
Hey! Hey! What the fuck are you...

01:05:32.510 --> 01:05:33.499
Dad!

01:05:34.345 --> 01:05:36.006
When they pull our bodies
out of this place,

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.911
there's not going to
be any tourist shots.

01:05:38.149 --> 01:05:41.209
Not of me and not of my boy! Understood?

01:05:41.285 --> 01:05:42.411
Back off, Frank!

01:05:42.486 --> 01:05:43.919
God!

01:05:44.889 --> 01:05:46.652
Are you okay, baby? Jesus Christ.

01:05:58.369 --> 01:06:01.497
You're actually enjoying this,
aren't you, Frank? Hmm?

01:06:01.572 --> 01:06:03.904
Making life or death
decisions. Playing God.

01:06:04.008 --> 01:06:06.533
There's no God down here.

01:06:06.611 --> 01:06:10.069
This place doesn't give a rat's arse
about you, or me,

01:06:10.715 --> 01:06:12.273
or any of us.

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:14.841
We're bits of dust passing through.

01:06:18.623 --> 01:06:19.612
Carl,

01:06:20.658 --> 01:06:22.057
George is gone.

01:06:22.159 --> 01:06:24.024
What do you mean, "Gone?"

01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:25.651
He fizzed up.

01:06:26.330 --> 01:06:28.764
Decompression sickness.

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:31.427
He's gone.

01:06:42.079 --> 01:06:44.070
Jesus, I'm sorry, Frank.

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:48.641
I'm sorry. Shit.

01:06:49.487 --> 01:06:50.579
Shit!

01:07:10.775 --> 01:07:13.869
Come on, keep up. Josh! Victoria!

01:08:10.835 --> 01:08:13.167
It's a meat grinder down there.

01:08:13.237 --> 01:08:14.329
Shit.

01:08:16.006 --> 01:08:18.372
Maybe we missed something.

01:08:18.442 --> 01:08:20.033
One of those tunnels back there.

01:08:20.111 --> 01:08:24.444
No, we follow the river
all the way to the ocean.

01:08:25.316 --> 01:08:26.943
Maybe we should head back,

01:08:27.017 --> 01:08:29.679
wait for the water to subside
so we can find another way out.

01:08:29.754 --> 01:08:32.051
Carl, you can do whatever you like.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:33.647
Josh and I are going down here.

01:08:36.694 --> 01:08:38.889
Can't we at least take a vote on it?

01:08:38.962 --> 01:08:40.453
All right, let's vote on it.

01:08:40.831 --> 01:08:43.231
Two against two. Now what do we do?

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:44.858
Come on. Enough of this bullshit!

01:08:45.770 --> 01:08:48.363
Let's go back and
check on those tunnels.

01:08:49.305 --> 01:08:50.933
No. Wait.

01:08:52.676 --> 01:08:54.075
No, no, no.

01:08:54.944 --> 01:08:56.502
It's best to stick together.

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:57.604
Okay.

01:08:58.749 --> 01:09:00.683
You better be right, Frank.

01:09:01.484 --> 01:09:03.850
There's a ledge below us.

01:09:04.087 --> 01:09:06.682
I can get a cam in there,

01:09:06.756 --> 01:09:10.488
but I'm going to need an anchor
so I can traverse around the other side.

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.553
Frank. I can hardly feel my fingers.

01:09:14.131 --> 01:09:16.031
Dad, it looks pretty tricky.
You should let me do it.

01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.591
No, absolutely not.

01:09:19.103 --> 01:09:20.661
Let him do it, Frank.

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:23.332
Your son is the best climber we have.

01:09:31.482 --> 01:09:35.509
All right. You be careful, please.

01:09:35.618 --> 01:09:37.143
I have control.

01:10:13.324 --> 01:10:14.484
You clipped in?

01:10:14.558 --> 01:10:16.321
Roger that!

01:11:11.682 --> 01:11:12.979
All right, give me some slack!

01:11:13.050 --> 01:11:15.177
I'm going to have
to improvise this last bit!

01:11:41.512 --> 01:11:43.742
Yes.

01:11:47.918 --> 01:11:49.408
Are you good?

01:11:51.622 --> 01:11:53.112
I'm good.

01:11:53.791 --> 01:11:55.224
Good.

01:11:55.292 --> 01:11:56.657
Good boy.

01:12:45.409 --> 01:12:47.240
Are you okay?

01:12:48.612 --> 01:12:49.943
Get that light off her!

01:12:53.984 --> 01:12:54.973
My hair!

01:12:55.052 --> 01:12:56.144
Jesus Christ!

01:12:56.854 --> 01:12:58.082
Hang on, honey!

01:12:58.155 --> 01:13:00.214
Victoria! Try not to move!

01:13:00.290 --> 01:13:01.314
What's going on?

01:13:01.392 --> 01:13:02.518
Her hair is caught in the rack!

01:13:02.626 --> 01:13:04.423
Jesus Christ!

01:13:06.163 --> 01:13:07.721
Hang on in there, honey!

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.660
Hang on!

01:13:11.535 --> 01:13:13.059
Joshua, get back!

01:13:13.137 --> 01:13:16.300
Get off that line.
It won't take the weight!

01:13:16.373 --> 01:13:17.806
Help me!

01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:19.604
Hang in there, Vic! We're coming!

01:13:19.677 --> 01:13:21.167
Victoria, listen to me!

01:13:21.245 --> 01:13:22.906
You have to transfer your weight!

01:13:23.047 --> 01:13:24.105
Try and get a foothold!

01:13:24.181 --> 01:13:25.205
I can't get a hold!

01:13:25.282 --> 01:13:27.614
For Christ's sake!
She has to do something!

01:13:28.152 --> 01:13:29.585
All right! I'm coming up!

01:13:29.653 --> 01:13:32.520
You're not! You're staying here
until we work out a plan.

01:13:33.023 --> 01:13:34.320
Victoria, don't panic!

01:13:34.391 --> 01:13:36.325
I can reach her.

01:13:36.527 --> 01:13:37.755
Hang on in there, Vic! Hang on!

01:13:37.828 --> 01:13:40.353
Victoria! Listen to me!

01:13:40.431 --> 01:13:42.365
I know you're in a lot of pain,

01:13:42.433 --> 01:13:43.957
but you have to stay there! Help me!

01:13:44.034 --> 01:13:47.333
Do nothing until we can
get a rope up to you! You understand?

01:13:47.905 --> 01:13:49.668
I'm going to cut my hair free!

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:52.301
No! Do not use your knife!

01:13:52.509 --> 01:13:53.635
Everest.

01:13:53.711 --> 01:13:55.076
Put your knife away!

01:13:55.145 --> 01:13:56.476
Take that knife away from the rope!

01:13:56.547 --> 01:13:58.014
I can get up to her!

01:13:58.415 --> 01:13:59.404
Christ!

01:13:59.483 --> 01:14:00.541
Put your knife away!

01:14:00.617 --> 01:14:01.641
Victoria!

01:14:01.719 --> 01:14:03.243
I can climb up there and I can get her!

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.844
Do you understand me?

01:14:04.922 --> 01:14:07.015
I can get up to her!

01:14:15.265 --> 01:14:17.927
Victoria!

01:14:19.636 --> 01:14:22.730
Christ! Jesus Christ!

01:14:24.508 --> 01:14:26.100
Fuck!

01:14:44.294 --> 01:14:46.285
We should get going.

01:14:52.402 --> 01:14:53.528
Josh?

01:15:00.611 --> 01:15:03.205
Victoria made her own choices.

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:06.147
All right? She chose
to come down here without experience,

01:15:07.284 --> 01:15:10.048
she chose to dive without a wetsuit,

01:15:10.621 --> 01:15:12.953
she chose to use her knife.

01:15:13.824 --> 01:15:15.348
That's three big mistakes

01:15:15.692 --> 01:15:17.887
in a place you're lucky
to get away with one.

01:15:17.961 --> 01:15:20.486
Now we've only got one re-breather left.

01:15:20.664 --> 01:15:23.462
You heartless bastard.

01:15:25.102 --> 01:15:26.899
Have you no decency? Huh?

01:15:30.107 --> 01:15:31.335
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:15:34.044 --> 01:15:36.444
We can mourn her in the daylight.

01:15:38.415 --> 01:15:40.246
We got to get on.

01:15:41.485 --> 01:15:43.976
How did you become like this?

01:15:46.023 --> 01:15:47.149
Look,

01:15:50.828 --> 01:15:51.954
Josh,

01:15:54.765 --> 01:15:57.791
I know I haven't been
anything of a father to you.

01:15:58.602 --> 01:16:00.536
All right?

01:16:00.604 --> 01:16:03.471
I'm not much good up there.
Full stop, mate.

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.303
That's just a fact.

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:10.411
Cities and cars and mortgages,

01:16:10.480 --> 01:16:13.472
I could never be
what your mother needed.

01:16:14.451 --> 01:16:16.715
Or probably what you needed.

01:16:17.354 --> 01:16:18.480
Why?

01:16:19.623 --> 01:16:21.648
Why caves?

01:16:21.758 --> 01:16:25.387
Down here, I can make sense of this.

01:16:25.462 --> 01:16:27.862
Do you know what I mean? I can...

01:16:29.733 --> 01:16:31.496
It's like my church.

01:16:32.569 --> 01:16:36.562
I can hold a mirror up
and say, "This is who I am."

01:16:42.012 --> 01:16:43.673
I don't want to die, Dad.

01:16:45.482 --> 01:16:46.847
I don't want to die down here.

01:16:52.489 --> 01:16:55.822
It's all right. It's all right.

01:16:57.527 --> 01:16:58.619
It's all right.

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.958
It's all right, mate.

01:17:04.468 --> 01:17:06.368
We're not going to die.

01:17:09.306 --> 01:17:11.604
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:17:13.810 --> 01:17:17.678
We're going to get out of here,
all right? Yep?

01:17:18.949 --> 01:17:20.177
Yep.

01:17:22.052 --> 01:17:23.314
Okay.

01:17:26.890 --> 01:17:28.755
Let's keep moving.

01:18:08.865 --> 01:18:11.663
Good Christ. Dead end again.

01:18:21.612 --> 01:18:24.513
All right, we'll rest
up here for a while.

01:18:24.582 --> 01:18:29.042
And I'll take the last re-breather,
run through, see if she goes.

01:18:29.687 --> 01:18:33.316
Then I'll come back and get you, Josh,
and later, you, Carl.

01:18:34.125 --> 01:18:35.490
Yep?

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:38.791
Sure, Frank. Whatever you say.

01:18:43.234 --> 01:18:45.930
Dad! Carl's taking the re-breather!

01:18:50.108 --> 01:18:51.735
What's he doing?

01:18:52.410 --> 01:18:53.968
He's not going to come back.

01:18:54.045 --> 01:18:56.172
The son of a bitch.

01:19:39.524 --> 01:19:41.082
Fuck.

01:19:42.994 --> 01:19:44.985
Come on.

01:19:59.777 --> 01:20:01.574
Dad. Dad.

01:20:19.097 --> 01:20:20.462
Is it dead?

01:20:21.499 --> 01:20:22.761
Yep.

01:20:39.717 --> 01:20:42.151
Well, the tunnel could choke.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:43.687
Then he'd have to come back.

01:20:44.222 --> 01:20:47.123
If the tunnel chokes, we're dead anyway.

01:20:49.026 --> 01:20:50.687
So what do we do now?

01:20:53.698 --> 01:20:54.687
I don't know.

01:20:55.933 --> 01:20:58.902
I'm tired. Need to rest.

01:20:59.403 --> 01:21:01.667
What are you talking about?
We have to go back.

01:21:01.739 --> 01:21:03.900
We will find another way out.

01:21:07.645 --> 01:21:08.976
What's wrong with you?

01:21:11.482 --> 01:21:13.882
You remind me of me.

01:21:15.319 --> 01:21:16.877
Shit.

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.842
Bat shit.

01:21:45.616 --> 01:21:47.481
Do you think there's a way out?

01:21:47.685 --> 01:21:51.121
Well, I'm guessing the bats
didn't swim down here.

01:22:04.602 --> 01:22:08.129
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

01:22:08.206 --> 01:22:10.970
"A stately pleasure-dome decree"

01:22:12.610 --> 01:22:14.441
What's that?

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.038
Coleridge.

01:22:19.817 --> 01:22:21.478
Very hippy-skippy.

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:26.115
Well, he was on drugs when he wrote it.

01:22:28.693 --> 01:22:30.490
I didn't know you were into poetry.

01:22:33.531 --> 01:22:35.158
I'm not.

01:22:36.267 --> 01:22:38.201
Your mother was.

01:22:45.509 --> 01:22:47.033
Teach it to me.

01:22:54.785 --> 01:22:57.618
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

01:22:58.422 --> 01:23:01.255
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

01:23:01.325 --> 01:23:04.453
"A stately pleasure-dome
decree

01:23:04.528 --> 01:23:07.156
"A stately pleasure-dome decree

01:23:07.231 --> 01:23:11.031
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

01:23:11.102 --> 01:23:14.162
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

01:23:14.238 --> 01:23:17.230
"Through caverns measureless to man

01:23:17.308 --> 01:23:20.141
"Through caverns measureless to man"

01:23:23.514 --> 01:23:26.142
Get up there. Climb over me.

01:23:45.403 --> 01:23:48.429
Here, give me your hand.

01:24:19.170 --> 01:24:21.570
Motherfucker!

01:24:22.273 --> 01:24:23.900
-Good work.
-Yes.

01:24:23.974 --> 01:24:25.635
Good work.

01:24:29.513 --> 01:24:30.639
Bullshit.

01:24:30.715 --> 01:24:33.275
I've got no light.

01:24:35.453 --> 01:24:37.080
Right.

01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:12.286
Shit.

01:25:12.356 --> 01:25:13.448
Okay.

01:25:34.745 --> 01:25:37.805
We should rest up.

01:25:54.799 --> 01:25:56.266
Wait.

01:25:57.401 --> 01:25:59.392
Dad, I can see you.

01:26:35.239 --> 01:26:37.571
Well, we're not climbing out of here.

01:26:47.651 --> 01:26:50.142
Now that's something
you don't see every day.

01:26:50.221 --> 01:26:51.745
A tank?

01:26:52.456 --> 01:26:54.356
A bloody tank?

01:26:54.859 --> 01:26:56.690
Japanese.

01:26:56.760 --> 01:26:59.752
They were all over
this place during the war.

01:27:01.131 --> 01:27:02.758
Amphibious.

01:27:05.236 --> 01:27:07.500
We must be pretty near the coast.

01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:12.766
The cave must have
collapsed underneath them.

01:27:13.811 --> 01:27:15.938
Do you think anyone survived?

01:27:16.013 --> 01:27:17.480
Doesn't look like it.

01:27:44.742 --> 01:27:46.607
There you go.

01:27:47.278 --> 01:27:48.802
Told you.

01:27:57.021 --> 01:28:00.388
We could stay here, you know?
Hope that someone finds us.

01:28:00.491 --> 01:28:02.959
Assuming they're looking for us.

01:28:03.093 --> 01:28:04.082
Huh.

01:28:04.628 --> 01:28:07.597
Assumption is the mother
of all fuck-ups.

01:28:07.665 --> 01:28:09.758
That sounds familiar.

01:28:09.833 --> 01:28:11.926
And we're so close.

01:28:12.603 --> 01:28:14.594
Now that's just teasing us.

01:28:15.005 --> 01:28:17.132
Don't take it personally.

01:28:17.675 --> 01:28:21.372
We're here now, that's the main thing.

01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:27.542
So what do we do?

01:28:27.618 --> 01:28:30.485
Do we stay here or do we push on?

01:28:31.255 --> 01:28:32.654
You decide.

01:29:14.898 --> 01:29:17.230
Hey, Dad, I've found the river.

01:29:24.942 --> 01:29:26.603
Lost my grip.

01:29:26.677 --> 01:29:29.805
Well, you should be more careful.

01:29:51.535 --> 01:29:52.524
Carl.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.640
Empty.

01:30:06.850 --> 01:30:07.942
Dead.

01:30:12.389 --> 01:30:14.823
The river has flushed everything
through here like a sewer.

01:30:14.892 --> 01:30:16.723
Yeah.

01:30:16.794 --> 01:30:18.762
It stinks in here.

01:30:18.829 --> 01:30:20.126
Josh?

01:30:21.098 --> 01:30:23.760
Josh? Frank?

01:30:23.834 --> 01:30:26.029
Is that you, guys?

01:30:28.205 --> 01:30:30.264
Thank God.

01:30:30.340 --> 01:30:31.705
Thank God!

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.177
Carl.

01:30:38.782 --> 01:30:40.272
What the fuck?

01:30:41.685 --> 01:30:43.550
What the hell were you thinking?

01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:47.749
Well, I was going to
come back for you guys.

01:30:47.825 --> 01:30:50.089
I would have come back.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.856
I would have, you know?
I just ran out of air.

01:30:54.832 --> 01:30:56.800
Please.

01:30:56.867 --> 01:30:58.300
You got any food?

01:30:58.802 --> 01:31:00.599
Yeah, of course.

01:31:04.708 --> 01:31:05.697
Thanks.

01:31:06.510 --> 01:31:07.841
Thank you.

01:31:12.783 --> 01:31:15.047
Frank, Frank, please.

01:31:15.119 --> 01:31:16.848
Please don't go over there, Frank.

01:31:17.955 --> 01:31:19.547
Frank, please.

01:31:20.991 --> 01:31:23.221
Please, Frank.

01:31:29.566 --> 01:31:32.399
The river dumped her here, Josh.

01:31:32.469 --> 01:31:34.437
Like a piece of garbage.

01:31:35.405 --> 01:31:37.965
Josh, I'm sorry, buddy.

01:31:40.544 --> 01:31:42.171
I messed up, you know?

01:31:43.046 --> 01:31:45.378
I admit it, I messed up. Okay?

01:31:45.516 --> 01:31:47.780
I panicked, you know?
It was a moment of madness.

01:31:47.918 --> 01:31:49.886
I don't know what came over me.

01:31:50.654 --> 01:31:53.748
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Josh.

01:31:53.824 --> 01:31:55.917
Good girl, Judes.

01:31:59.997 --> 01:32:01.692
Josh, let's go.

01:32:02.399 --> 01:32:04.196
Wait. What?

01:32:04.902 --> 01:32:06.199
Josh?

01:32:07.171 --> 01:32:08.263
Josh.

01:32:08.338 --> 01:32:10.431
No, no, no.
You're not gonna leave me here. No way.

01:32:10.674 --> 01:32:12.938
You can do whatever you like.

01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:14.534
Frank.

01:32:15.879 --> 01:32:17.744
Well, fuck you, Frank!

01:32:23.954 --> 01:32:25.012
She goes.

01:32:25.088 --> 01:32:27.147
-There's a tight squeeze...
-Yeah?

01:32:27.224 --> 01:32:28.714
...but once you get through,
it's crystal clear.

01:32:28.792 --> 01:32:31.283
Well, we'll buddy-breathe
through the sump.

01:32:31.361 --> 01:32:32.623
One breath each.

01:32:32.763 --> 01:32:34.390
Nice shallow breaths.

01:32:34.464 --> 01:32:36.125
What about Carl?

01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:37.224
I'll go get him.

01:34:04.955 --> 01:34:08.118
Can't breathe. It's my back.

01:34:08.325 --> 01:34:10.953
It's in my, it's in my...

01:34:17.467 --> 01:34:20.265
No, no, Josh. No, Josh.

01:34:25.042 --> 01:34:26.441
Josh,

01:34:27.411 --> 01:34:30.471
you trust the cave, all right?

01:34:30.547 --> 01:34:32.845
Trust the cave and follow the river.

01:34:32.916 --> 01:34:34.474
It'll lead you out.

01:34:34.551 --> 01:34:36.041
What?

01:34:36.920 --> 01:34:39.150
-No. No, we can still make it.
-Shh-shh.

01:34:39.523 --> 01:34:41.991
Dad, we can buddy-breathe like you said.

01:34:42.059 --> 01:34:43.083
It'll be fine.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.184
It's all right.

01:34:51.168 --> 01:34:53.659
He killed Victoria, Josh.

01:34:53.737 --> 01:34:55.102
Luko.

01:34:55.172 --> 01:34:56.639
He'll kill all of us!

01:34:57.074 --> 01:35:00.737
You take one step closer
and I will fucking kill you.

01:35:02.346 --> 01:35:06.009
The only reason
we're still breathing is because of him.

01:35:47.057 --> 01:35:50.151
Josh, could you get me into the water?

01:35:50.227 --> 01:35:53.560
Could you help me into the water?

01:36:07.044 --> 01:36:12.072
You've got better instinct than me,
so listen to it, all right?

01:36:16.253 --> 01:36:19.086
You keep going and don't you give up,

01:36:19.156 --> 01:36:21.681
or you'll be back on my shitlist.

01:36:21.758 --> 01:36:25.194
No. Dad, I'm not leaving you here.

01:36:27.197 --> 01:36:28.596
Can you...

01:36:30.233 --> 01:36:32.360
Can you help me?

01:36:32.436 --> 01:36:33.994
Help me.

01:36:34.071 --> 01:36:36.596
I don't want this to take too long.

01:36:37.674 --> 01:36:40.165
No. No, no, no.

01:36:43.647 --> 01:36:46.514
It's all right. It's all right.

01:36:48.251 --> 01:36:50.048
I'll stay. I'll stay with you.

01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:52.748
I will stay with you.

01:36:52.823 --> 01:36:54.154
You'll be fine.

01:36:54.224 --> 01:36:56.215
Hey, no.

01:36:56.293 --> 01:36:59.490
You stay and you die.

01:37:00.597 --> 01:37:02.462
No, no.

01:37:03.500 --> 01:37:05.559
Just help me.

01:37:06.403 --> 01:37:08.837
I'm so proud of you, Josh.

01:37:09.473 --> 01:37:11.407
Please help me.

01:39:41.224 --> 01:39:44.318
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan

01:39:44.394 --> 01:39:47.830
"A stately pleasure-dome decree

01:39:47.897 --> 01:39:51.025
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran

01:39:53.670 --> 01:39:56.195
"Through caverns measureless to man

01:39:57.374 --> 01:39:59.274
"Down to a sunless sea"

01:42:17.814 --> 01:42:19.179
Joshua.

01:42:21.951 --> 01:42:23.077
Josh.

01:42:25.321 --> 01:42:26.788
It's time to go.

01:42:27.824 --> 01:42:29.655
Are we home yet?

01:42:31.594 --> 01:42:33.084
Nearly.

01:43:21.711 --> 01:43:23.975
George was right.

01:43:24.047 --> 01:43:26.277
I never knew my father,

01:43:26.349 --> 01:43:28.544
but I found him in that cave.

01:43:29.819 --> 01:43:32.287
He was a hell of a fella,

01:43:32.355 --> 01:43:33.913
once you got to know him.
