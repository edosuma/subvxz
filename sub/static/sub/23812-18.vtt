00:12.325 --> 00:15.546
Students, the annual
Knight School Battle Royale

00:15.656 --> 00:16.555
is quickly approaching.

00:16.557 --> 00:19.258
A battle royale!
Is that like a dance battle?

00:19.260 --> 00:23.395
Because you all are about to get served.

00:25.933 --> 00:28.333
No, man, don't do that.

00:29.570 --> 00:33.805
No, a battle royale
is an epic fight fest.

00:33.807 --> 00:35.774
And yeah, don't do that.

00:36.343 --> 00:38.610
She's correct. No weapons, no squads.

00:38.612 --> 00:42.881
Everyone for themselves, just
like all of my family reunions.

00:43.050 --> 00:46.018
And if you get knocked
to the ground, you're out.

00:46.020 --> 00:48.820
I'll be more than happy to show you.

00:49.723 --> 00:52.391
The ground's right there.

00:52.559 --> 00:54.660
Now we're in their heads!

00:54.662 --> 00:59.598
Previous winners include yours
truly, Kraipan's brother Lopan,

00:59.600 --> 01:01.867
and the brave Princess Eliza.

01:01.869 --> 01:04.336
Yes! You go, Eliza!

01:05.471 --> 01:08.707
I'm just a big fan... Not a relative.

01:10.744 --> 01:13.045
The battle is slated for next week.

01:13.047 --> 01:14.813
But our enemies don't keep a schedule,

01:14.815 --> 01:17.849
so the competition begins now!

01:27.494 --> 01:29.895
Take that, unicorns!

01:29.897 --> 01:32.364
Unicorn? More like uni-can't!

01:34.735 --> 01:36.768
You heard the rules. No squads.

01:36.770 --> 01:40.072
Sorry, but we're gonna have
to kick the Kraken out of you!

01:42.509 --> 01:44.643
Surprise attack!

01:45.212 --> 01:48.080
If you yell "surprise attack,"
it's not really a surprise.

01:48.082 --> 01:49.848
I realize that now.

01:53.420 --> 01:56.488
Prudy quake!

01:56.490 --> 01:58.657
Sage-nado!

02:04.998 --> 02:06.398
Wazzah!

02:08.435 --> 02:11.002
Arc and Ciara are the final two.

02:11.538 --> 02:13.405
Don't take this butt-kicking personally.

02:13.407 --> 02:16.708
My butt doesn't take
anything personally.

02:29.623 --> 02:32.591
Oh, ho, ho! Arc wins!

02:34.094 --> 02:36.428
I won? Can I do my dance now?

02:36.430 --> 02:38.797
Dance like no one's watching, buddy.

02:43.670 --> 02:45.437
Okay, calm down.

02:45.439 --> 02:47.706
You won the battle, not
"Astoria's Got Talent."

02:49.076 --> 02:51.943
Let's check the updated standings.

02:57.084 --> 02:59.584
I'm not the top student anymore.

02:59.586 --> 03:01.119
Some guy named Arc is.

03:01.121 --> 03:03.688
Wait, that's me.

03:04.792 --> 03:08.126
Brave Ciara, come to Prudie!

03:08.862 --> 03:10.595
I can't believe I'm in third place.

03:10.597 --> 03:12.063
I used to rule this school!

03:12.065 --> 03:14.566
I'm number one... twice!

03:17.104 --> 03:18.837
That's an 11.

03:20.474 --> 03:22.073
Great battle royale, students.

03:22.075 --> 03:26.611
Now make room so the school
janitor can clean this mess up.

03:26.613 --> 03:29.748
Slobwick's gonna help.
He works here now, too.

03:30.617 --> 03:32.717
Oh, congratulations.

03:32.719 --> 03:34.553
I'm not paying you either.

03:38.459 --> 03:42.093
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm happy for you.

03:42.095 --> 03:45.130
I just wanted to win
this like my sister did.

03:45.132 --> 03:47.866
It's not your fault I have an edge.

03:47.868 --> 03:48.733
What does that mean?

03:48.735 --> 03:50.902
I'm at the school
pretending to be a Dragon Blood

03:50.904 --> 03:52.971
because Ryker
attacked my village, alright?

03:52.973 --> 03:56.208
I train hard every day so that
I can get revenge on him.

03:56.210 --> 03:58.210
Hey, I wanna take down Ryker, too.

03:58.212 --> 04:00.512
Yeah, but you have less time to train

04:00.514 --> 04:01.913
because of your princess duties.

04:01.915 --> 04:04.716
Are you saying being
the princess is a weakness?

04:04.718 --> 04:09.921
No, not a weakness, just...
a huge disadvantage.

04:09.923 --> 04:12.891
That's another word for weakness!

04:14.194 --> 04:14.926
Not disadvantage!

04:14.928 --> 04:18.163
Just something that's
definitely holding you back!

04:18.665 --> 04:21.632
Come back! I promise I'll stop talking!

04:27.641 --> 04:28.406
Prudie, what's wrong?

04:28.408 --> 04:31.176
You haven't touched your
third plate of hamburgers.

04:32.546 --> 04:33.144
I'm bummed.

04:33.146 --> 04:36.581
Arc and Ciara are at the top
of the leaderboard, and we're...

04:36.583 --> 04:37.983
Just as good.

04:37.985 --> 04:39.050
Eh...

04:39.052 --> 04:40.719
Almost as good?

04:40.721 --> 04:41.653
Mm...

04:41.655 --> 04:43.688
The dead weight on the squad?

04:44.124 --> 04:46.157
If Phoenix Squad is ever
going to become knights,

04:46.159 --> 04:48.927
we need to be at the top
of the leaderboard, too.

04:48.929 --> 04:49.594
Look, we will.

04:49.596 --> 04:52.097
And trust me, Prudie, nobody
thinks we're the dead weight.

04:52.099 --> 04:53.932
What's up, dead weight?

04:54.101 --> 04:57.536
Sage, don't pick on us just
because you're in the top three.

04:57.538 --> 04:59.704
What? No one wants to be third.

04:59.706 --> 05:01.239
It rhymes with turd!

05:01.608 --> 05:04.109
Also, smurd, which isn't a word.

05:04.111 --> 05:05.777
But I'm working on it.

05:05.946 --> 05:09.314
Oh, Sir Gareth, if one was
upset about one's ranking,

05:09.316 --> 05:11.249
how would they go about raising it?

05:11.251 --> 05:14.085
Same question, less annoying.

05:14.254 --> 05:16.855
Well, students can earn hero points

05:16.857 --> 05:18.156
for an extremely heroic act.

05:18.158 --> 05:20.792
Like offering you
ketchup for your fries?

05:20.794 --> 05:22.294
Oh, do you have ketchup?

05:22.296 --> 05:23.962
No.

05:28.669 --> 05:31.036
Okay, Prudie, we have to
get those hero points.

05:31.038 --> 05:32.203
Not if we get them first.

05:32.205 --> 05:36.808
Yeah, this whole hero points
thing sounds really smurd!

05:37.110 --> 05:39.744
It's catching on!

05:42.916 --> 05:44.182
Princess?

05:44.751 --> 05:45.483
I know you're mad at me,

05:45.485 --> 05:49.254
so I got you a bag of
marshmallows to say I'm sorry.

05:49.256 --> 05:53.725
Then I passed a campfire,
so... here's an empty bag.

05:55.028 --> 05:56.828
You don't need to apologize...

05:56.830 --> 06:00.665
which is good, because
that was a horrible apology.

06:01.101 --> 06:05.170
You were just bringing up
what I worry about every day.

06:05.172 --> 06:07.305
You know what I worry about?

06:07.307 --> 06:08.039
Cavities.

06:08.041 --> 06:11.643
I just ate a whole bag of marshmallows.

06:12.846 --> 06:16.915
I'm worried that being
the princess is a weakness.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.750
I miss so much training.

06:18.752 --> 06:21.019
Come on, you haven't missed that much.

06:21.021 --> 06:23.855
I missed knife throwing
because I had a royal ball.

06:23.857 --> 06:27.192
I also missed dragon riding
because I had a royal ball.

06:27.194 --> 06:30.095
I have to go to a lot of royal balls!

06:31.698 --> 06:34.032
- Wow, that's terrible.
- I know.

06:34.034 --> 06:36.968
But at least I get
shrimp wrapped in bacon.

06:37.304 --> 06:39.638
No, I was talking about that knight.

06:43.276 --> 06:45.377
That's my sister!

06:47.948 --> 06:49.381
Oh, hey, little sis.

06:49.850 --> 06:53.151
Eliza, you're really back!

07:00.160 --> 07:01.226
Do you wanna know a secret?

07:01.228 --> 07:03.695
I'm a princess whose father
won't let her become a knight.

07:03.697 --> 07:05.964
Please let me go to Knight
School, Daddy! Please, please!

07:05.966 --> 07:10.702
So I use a magic ring
and secretly train as Ciara.

07:10.704 --> 07:11.136
Yes!

07:11.138 --> 07:12.837
And I'm Arc, a charming thief,

07:12.839 --> 07:13.738
who has the same dream.

07:13.740 --> 07:14.606
I'm destined to become a knight.

07:14.608 --> 07:17.142
But people from outside
the kingdom aren't allowed

07:17.144 --> 07:17.842
in Knight School.

07:17.844 --> 07:19.210
So I'm pretending I belong here.

07:19.212 --> 07:21.212
Now, we protect
each other's secrets.

07:21.214 --> 07:24.683
So we can achieve
our dream of becoming knights.

07:36.363 --> 07:38.063
Royal guests!

07:38.065 --> 07:41.800
My daughter Eliza has returned.

07:41.802 --> 07:42.867
Keep it together, Dad.

07:42.869 --> 07:45.236
I'm trying!

07:45.772 --> 07:48.006
To celebrate this joyous occasion,

07:48.008 --> 07:51.342
I'm sharing syrup from
my chocolate fountain.

07:51.344 --> 07:55.780
Is this the same chocolate
you take your morning bath in?

07:55.782 --> 07:56.314
Yes.

07:56.316 --> 07:58.316
If you don't want yours, I'll take it.

07:58.318 --> 08:01.152
Hands off, Wizard.

08:01.388 --> 08:05.256
Princess Eliza will now say a few words.

08:05.258 --> 08:10.061
Oh, I promised I wouldn't cry,
but here come the tears of joy!

08:10.864 --> 08:12.130
Thank you, Dad.

08:12.132 --> 08:15.934
Most of you were unaware that
I was on a secret mission

08:15.936 --> 08:17.869
to find the Armor of Astoria.

08:17.871 --> 08:21.039
I knew! We're tight like that.

08:21.041 --> 08:23.975
Since the armor makes
whoever wears it invincible,

08:23.977 --> 08:25.977
I wanted to use it to defeat Ryker.

08:25.979 --> 08:29.547
I knew that part. We're tight like that.

08:30.150 --> 08:32.450
No, we're not.

08:33.320 --> 08:37.087
Before I could find the armor, I
was intercepted by Ryker's army.

08:37.090 --> 08:40.125
Thinking of the good people of Astoria

08:40.126 --> 08:42.527
gave me the strength to fight them off.

08:42.529 --> 08:45.330
Yeah, she did! 'Cause she's my hero!

08:45.332 --> 08:47.966
Ryker is destroying
every village in his path,

08:47.968 --> 08:48.967
looking for the armor.

08:48.969 --> 08:50.902
It's only a matter of
time before he finds it.

08:50.904 --> 08:55.106
If Ryker finds that
armor, he'll be invincible,

08:55.108 --> 08:58.877
and Astoria is doomed.

08:58.879 --> 09:00.378
Way to bring down the party, Hogancross.

09:00.380 --> 09:04.315
See, this is why I didn't
invite you to my barbecue.

09:04.317 --> 09:07.952
Listen, we can't let
our enemies ruin this feast.

09:07.954 --> 09:11.523
So please continue
celebrating Eliza's return

09:11.525 --> 09:14.893
and eating my bathtub chocolate.

09:19.366 --> 09:20.431
With all this Ryker stuff,

09:20.433 --> 09:23.334
I hope you've been using that
pixie crystal ring I gave you.

09:23.336 --> 09:26.271
Yeah, I turn into Ciara
every chance I get

09:26.273 --> 09:29.440
to train at Knight School.
I was top student until...

09:29.442 --> 09:34.879
Until a handsome young
warrior kicked your patootie!

09:36.049 --> 09:37.415
Arc, what are you doing here?

09:37.417 --> 09:42.287
Arc? I am Wizard Dumplebaggins.

09:43.390 --> 09:46.024
This feast is for royals
and honored guests only.

09:46.026 --> 09:47.625
But I have to ask Eliza

09:47.627 --> 09:49.427
where she thinks
the invincible armor is.

09:49.429 --> 09:52.163
I need to use it to
get revenge on Ryker.

09:52.165 --> 09:53.898
I'll get rid of him.

09:53.900 --> 09:55.466
- Hogancross?
- Hmm?

09:55.468 --> 09:58.236
Come meet Wizard Dummiebaggins.

09:59.873 --> 10:03.575
I thought I knew every
wizard in the kingdom.

10:03.577 --> 10:06.044
You don't remember me?

10:06.046 --> 10:09.280
We were bunkmates at wizard camp.

10:09.516 --> 10:12.383
I never went to wizard camp.

10:12.385 --> 10:14.352
Didn't sell enough cookies.

10:14.354 --> 10:19.591
Which means you're lying
and about to eat fireballs!

10:19.593 --> 10:22.927
Would a fake wizard do this?

10:29.069 --> 10:31.369
Sorry Arc bugged you about the armor.

10:31.371 --> 10:33.972
It's not like you know where it is.

10:33.974 --> 10:35.607
Actually...

10:35.609 --> 10:38.309
I knew there was gonna be an "actually"!

10:38.311 --> 10:41.279
I do know where it is, and I
have a map to where it's hidden.

10:41.281 --> 10:43.915
But there's no way I can
make it there with my injury.

10:43.917 --> 10:45.283
Then let's give the map to the knights.

10:45.285 --> 10:49.187
- They can get the armor.
- Ryker's spies are everywhere.

10:49.189 --> 10:52.323
There's only one person
I trust to get it.

10:52.325 --> 10:52.790
Dad?

10:52.792 --> 10:55.693
He hasn't gone anywhere
by himself in 20 years.

10:55.695 --> 10:58.596
I have to potty. Let's go, people.

11:00.066 --> 11:04.002
Yeah, I wasn't talking
about Dad, obviously.

11:04.004 --> 11:06.971
- I was talking about you.
- Me?

11:06.973 --> 11:09.674
Remember how we used to
pretend to be legendary knights

11:09.676 --> 11:10.975
when we were kids?

11:10.977 --> 11:14.245
Well, this is your chance
to be one for real...

11:14.247 --> 11:15.980
and save our kingdom.

11:20.086 --> 11:20.685
Students!

11:20.687 --> 11:23.254
Ryker is close to getting
the Armor of Astoria.

11:23.256 --> 11:26.357
And with it, he can march
through the crystal force field

11:26.359 --> 11:27.592
into the castle.

11:27.594 --> 11:29.961
How do we defeat the armor?

11:29.963 --> 11:32.263
The simple answer is...

11:32.265 --> 11:34.065
I haven't a clue.

11:34.968 --> 11:35.733
We're looking for ideas

11:35.735 --> 11:38.169
from the best and brightest
minds in the kingdom.

11:40.006 --> 11:41.706
Slobby has an idea.

11:43.043 --> 11:45.977
No, just gas.

11:45.979 --> 11:49.280
Well, that's the second-best
idea we've heard today.

11:49.282 --> 11:52.150
Come on, Hogancross, poof me
back to my chocolate fountain.

11:52.152 --> 11:55.153
I think better with
chocolate between my toes.

11:56.156 --> 11:59.057
Now, class, today, instead of training,

11:59.059 --> 12:00.358
you will be brainstorming ideas

12:00.360 --> 12:03.594
on how to defeat the Armor of Astoria.

12:05.198 --> 12:08.066
Prudie, if we figure out
how to defeat the armor,

12:08.068 --> 12:09.634
we'll get all the hero points.

12:09.636 --> 12:12.570
And then we'll move
up on the leaderboard.

12:12.572 --> 12:15.139
Go, Team Dead Weight!

12:15.141 --> 12:17.608
Yeah, we should get a better team name.

12:17.610 --> 12:19.010
Mm.

12:20.246 --> 12:21.045
Did you hear that?

12:21.047 --> 12:23.781
They're trying to defeat Ryker
and take all the hero points.

12:23.783 --> 12:26.417
We have to beat
Giant Dork and Magic Dork to it.

12:26.419 --> 12:30.021
Great idea, Sage!
Then we'll be the dorks!

12:32.325 --> 12:35.159
Everyone's thinking about
this all wrong, alright?

12:35.161 --> 12:36.627
We don't have to defeat the armor.

12:36.629 --> 12:38.463
We just have to get to it first.

12:38.465 --> 12:41.332
Did your sister say anything
about where it might be?

12:41.334 --> 12:43.601
She... did not say anything,

12:43.603 --> 12:47.138
and she certainly doesn't have a map!

12:47.540 --> 12:50.241
Oh my goblin, she has a map!

12:51.344 --> 12:52.143
You know what this means?

12:52.145 --> 12:54.712
I can find the armor and
get revenge on Ryker.

12:54.714 --> 12:56.714
Eliza wants me to get it myself.

12:56.716 --> 13:00.551
But I thought about it, and
I'm going to tell her no.

13:01.821 --> 13:02.620
Why?

13:02.622 --> 13:05.390
How can I save the kingdom
when I missed so much training

13:05.392 --> 13:09.360
being the princess?
I don't have what it takes.

13:09.362 --> 13:14.599
Lucky for you, you have the
greatest weapon in the kingdom.

13:15.468 --> 13:17.101
Me.

13:17.103 --> 13:19.704
Now I'm definitely not going.

13:20.774 --> 13:24.742
The greatest weapon is tired
of you walking away from him!

13:31.251 --> 13:34.685
Oh! Sorry, Princess Eliza.

13:34.687 --> 13:36.254
You survived a battle with Ryker,

13:36.256 --> 13:40.258
only to be attacked by charming old me.

13:40.627 --> 13:44.195
You think you're charming.
That's interesting.

13:44.864 --> 13:46.531
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

13:46.533 --> 13:49.867
Look at us, palling
around like new friends.

13:49.869 --> 13:52.503
My sister didn't
tell me you were so weird.

13:52.505 --> 13:53.538
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

13:53.540 --> 13:55.506
I'm kidding. She told me.

13:56.309 --> 13:58.576
Well, she also told me something.

13:58.578 --> 14:01.712
You have a map to the Armor of Astoria.

14:01.714 --> 14:02.447
You know?

14:02.449 --> 14:04.615
You're not the only one
she tells everything to.

14:04.617 --> 14:06.784
I am basically her other sister.

14:07.420 --> 14:09.821
Don't tell anybody about that map!

14:09.823 --> 14:14.392
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna pretend I see a friend.

14:14.394 --> 14:16.227
Hey, you! Ha!

14:18.665 --> 14:23.234
You think that hurts
my feelings, and it kinda does!

14:23.603 --> 14:27.538
I'll get over it, 'cause I
just pickpocketed your map.

14:28.441 --> 14:30.675
Time to get revenge on Ryker.

14:39.419 --> 14:42.920
So, are you ready to go get the armor?

14:42.922 --> 14:46.390
Look, Eliza, this is
really hard to tell you,

14:46.392 --> 14:47.925
because you're my hero.

14:48.194 --> 14:50.828
But I think we should send
the knights to do this.

14:50.830 --> 14:54.265
I told you you're
the only person I trust.

14:54.267 --> 14:55.633
Why won't you go?

14:55.635 --> 14:57.368
When you went to Knight School,

14:57.370 --> 14:58.736
you trained full time.

14:58.738 --> 15:01.873
I can't. You know Dad won't let me...

15:01.875 --> 15:04.842
which is why I'm just not good enough.

15:07.647 --> 15:09.580
Well, I think you are.

15:09.582 --> 15:10.882
And if your hero believes in you,

15:10.884 --> 15:13.217
shouldn't you believe in yourself?

15:13.219 --> 15:15.653
Astoria needs you to step up.

15:15.655 --> 15:19.624
So take this map, which...

15:19.626 --> 15:22.927
which I no longer have.
Someone stole it!

15:23.563 --> 15:26.764
By any chance did you
talk to Arc recently?

15:26.766 --> 15:28.966
Yeah, just a minute ago.

15:29.435 --> 15:30.902
He stole it, didn't he?

15:30.904 --> 15:33.271
Yeah, that's what he does.

15:35.642 --> 15:38.943
So the Armor of Astoria makes
whoever wears it invincible

15:38.945 --> 15:40.511
unless we can find a way to damage it.

15:40.513 --> 15:44.315
I just wish there was a way to
convince Ryker to take it off.

15:44.317 --> 15:45.516
Well, maybe we can...

15:45.518 --> 15:49.954
through the power
of the musical theater!

15:57.497 --> 15:59.397
Okay, you know I love it, but...

15:59.399 --> 16:02.366
something tells me Ryker
isn't a song-and-dance man.

16:02.368 --> 16:04.735
Well, the wizards made
the armor with magic.

16:04.737 --> 16:08.573
Maybe it can be defeated by
magic, like one of your spells.

16:08.575 --> 16:10.608
Wait, that's a good idea.

16:10.610 --> 16:13.277
Bookshelf, give me my book of spells!

16:14.614 --> 16:18.749
Hey, this is Buttercup's "Book
of Doodles and Happy Things."

16:18.918 --> 16:20.918
Sage and Buttercup stole my spell book!

16:20.920 --> 16:22.987
They must be trying to sabotage us.

16:22.989 --> 16:24.889
Then let's go sabotage them!

16:24.891 --> 16:29.427
- And sing about it on the way?
- Of course!

16:38.571 --> 16:40.871
Okay, I'll check out this battle axe

16:40.873 --> 16:42.473
and some armor underpants.

16:42.475 --> 16:44.709
Sorry, Slobby already checked out

16:44.711 --> 16:47.545
the last pair of armor underpants.

16:47.547 --> 16:49.280
Yah!

16:49.282 --> 16:51.616
Come on, Slobby, I need those.

16:54.621 --> 16:55.987
You... keep 'em.

16:56.556 --> 16:58.623
You can keep your fingers.

17:01.961 --> 17:03.361
Hey, Arc.

17:03.363 --> 17:05.529
Checking out some weapons?

17:05.999 --> 17:07.765
Yeah. I-I need a haircut,

17:07.767 --> 17:11.935
so I figured I'd just save
some money and do it myself.

17:12.605 --> 17:15.039
Well, then, go ahead.

17:20.613 --> 17:22.079
I can't do it!

17:22.080 --> 17:24.682
Okay, I stole the map and
I'm going to get the armor.

17:24.684 --> 17:27.852
You were just planning
to go by yourself?

17:27.854 --> 17:28.719
Yes, alright?

17:28.721 --> 17:30.621
It's better than waiting
for Ryker to find it.

17:30.623 --> 17:33.991
People with face tattoos
usually get what they want.

17:34.627 --> 17:36.661
Give me the map.

17:39.766 --> 17:41.065
Here.

17:41.801 --> 17:45.536
I can't believe you're just
gonna give it back to Eliza.

17:45.538 --> 17:46.871
I'm not.

17:46.873 --> 17:49.507
I'm using it to go get the armor.

17:49.776 --> 17:52.643
Wait, you said you didn't
have what it takes to do this.

17:52.645 --> 17:56.847
I'm not sure I do.
But Astoria needs me to step up.

17:56.849 --> 18:00.084
And needs me to go with you
so I can get the revenge

18:00.086 --> 18:02.453
I so desperately want?

18:02.689 --> 18:05.823
- Fine!
- Yes! Thank you.

18:05.825 --> 18:07.792
And I'm sorry about stealing the map.

18:07.794 --> 18:08.793
It'll never happen again.

18:08.795 --> 18:11.796
You took it from me while
we were talking, didn't you?

18:11.798 --> 18:13.130
Yes, I did.

18:23.876 --> 18:25.676
It's freezing up here!

18:26.379 --> 18:28.412
How did you know to dress so warm?

18:28.414 --> 18:29.380
The map says the armor's

18:29.382 --> 18:32.016
hidden on top of Mount Yougonnafreeze.

18:33.419 --> 18:34.852
Just go.

18:37.557 --> 18:38.522
Look!

18:38.524 --> 18:40.424
The Armor of Astoria!

18:41.361 --> 18:42.993
We found it!

18:45.531 --> 18:47.031
It's trapped in ice.

18:47.033 --> 18:48.132
There's a handprint on it.

18:48.134 --> 18:50.067
Hey, maybe that's how
you get the armor out!

18:50.069 --> 18:53.738
Okay, why don't you touch it
while I wear your gloves?

18:54.073 --> 18:56.474
And your scarf and your jacket.

19:03.015 --> 19:05.950
Whoa, the Armor of Astoria's ours!

19:05.952 --> 19:07.651
Now we can defeat Ryker!

19:07.653 --> 19:09.687
You'll have to defeat us first!

19:11.824 --> 19:13.090
- Ryker's goons!
- Goons?

19:13.092 --> 19:16.894
At least we know not to wear
short sleeves on a mountaintop.

19:18.131 --> 19:20.998
If they get the armor,
Ryker will be unstoppable.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.133
We'll have to fight them.

19:22.135 --> 19:25.536
I'll take Smelly, Tiny, and Fish Face.

19:25.538 --> 19:28.506
That leaves me Itchy,
Twitchy, and Fart Mask.

19:32.779 --> 19:35.846
Okay, all of the most
powerful weapons in Astoria

19:35.848 --> 19:38.816
are powered by... True love!

19:39.585 --> 19:43.421
If by true love, you
mean battle crystals.

19:43.856 --> 19:45.823
Sure!

19:45.825 --> 19:47.658
Okay.

19:49.028 --> 19:52.096
So, let's see if this
crystal-tipped arrow

19:52.098 --> 19:54.465
is powerful enough to penetrate armor.

20:04.477 --> 20:08.212
Cross that off the list, and
cross the list off the list.

20:09.148 --> 20:10.848
If it can't penetrate regular armor,

20:10.850 --> 20:13.451
how could it defeat
the Armor of Astoria?

20:13.453 --> 20:16.187
We need to find a way to boost
the power of these crystals.

20:16.189 --> 20:18.756
How about we boost the power of...

20:18.758 --> 20:21.625
the... the, uh, the...

20:21.627 --> 20:23.661
Where's my spell book?!

20:24.497 --> 20:25.629
- I don't know.
- Oh!

20:25.631 --> 20:28.032
Well, then, we don't know
where your weapons are.

20:30.603 --> 20:33.537
I think they're at
the bottom of the cliff.

20:34.807 --> 20:36.040
Why would you do that?

20:36.042 --> 20:38.042
I was going to give your spell book back

20:38.044 --> 20:39.944
after we got the hero points.

20:39.946 --> 20:42.613
I'm Sage! That's what I do!

20:43.716 --> 20:45.082
Well, give it to me now!

20:45.084 --> 20:47.184
Oh! Sure. Hmph.

20:47.186 --> 20:48.586
Here you go.

20:48.588 --> 20:49.854
Whoopsie.

20:51.524 --> 20:53.157
- No!
- No!

20:53.159 --> 20:55.526
How are we supposed to defeat
the armor without my spells?

20:55.528 --> 20:57.895
How are we supposed to do
it without my crystal weapons?

20:57.897 --> 21:00.931
Oh, I have a suggestion
for how to defeat the armor!

21:00.933 --> 21:02.967
Please do not say true love.

21:02.969 --> 21:05.102
I no longer have a suggestion.

21:27.960 --> 21:30.094
Fight harder, Arc! Astoria needs us!

21:30.096 --> 21:33.564
I'm trying! But I'm fighting them...

21:33.566 --> 21:35.199
and frostbite!

21:35.368 --> 21:37.835
We can't let them get the armor!

21:37.837 --> 21:40.538
They won't! Because I will.

21:41.307 --> 21:43.574
Eliza, you've come to save us!

21:45.745 --> 21:47.611
Put down your weapons.

21:47.613 --> 21:49.880
You heard her, Goon Squad!

21:49.882 --> 21:52.650
I was talking to you two.

21:55.655 --> 21:56.854
Eliza, what are you doing?

21:56.856 --> 22:00.291
Giving the Armor of
Astoria to our true ruler.

22:02.228 --> 22:05.930
- Ryker?
- That's right.

22:05.932 --> 22:08.132
Eliza's working for me.

22:11.270 --> 22:17.141
Now that I have the armor,
Astoria will be mine!
