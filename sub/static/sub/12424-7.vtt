I am not giving it back.

Oh, for... There is no plan!
There's no plan.

You've lost control
of this thing, all right?

35:15.906 --> 35:18.357
For Christ's sake,
you've sent
an innocent kid to hell.

there's no plan, Cassidy?[GROANS]

it has a reason.

if His reason,
if His judgment is to
send one more sinner,

one more lost
soul into the fire,
what can I do?

and watch him burn.

I'm no innocent, either.

And I think your God,
if He really does exist.

36:17.589 --> 36:22.628
He's not more than
a stocious muppet
who smells His own farts.

the worst of my sins, neither.
