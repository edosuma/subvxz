WEBVTT

00:34.970 --> 00:38.865
One more week until it's just
two of us...

00:38.890 --> 00:42.345
...finally alone on our honeymoon.

00:44.529 --> 00:47.384
Karl! Speaking of not
being alone...

00:47.409 --> 00:48.585
What? know.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.105
Go help your mother with dinner.

00:50.130 --> 00:51.105
I'll clean up here.

00:55.130 --> 00:57.314
What? love you, Nicole.

00:57.339 --> 00:59.915
And What? cannot wait to make
you my wife.

01:07.970 --> 01:09.355
OK. Another week!

01:29.890 --> 01:30.835
Karl?

01:33.730 --> 01:35.424
Karl?!

01:35.449 --> 01:37.075
Help me, Karl!

01:37.100 --> 01:38.065
Karl, help me!

01:40.820 --> 01:42.504
Karl!

01:42.529 --> 01:43.634
KARL, HELP ME!

01:49.260 --> 01:52.434
KARL! KARL, HELP ME!

01:52.459 --> 01:53.514
HELP ME!

01:58.459 --> 02:03.075
COUGHING

02:25.490 --> 02:27.285
And Claudette from the Nexus office

02:27.310 --> 02:29.195
just ordered five more two-a-day
deliveries.

02:29.220 --> 02:31.745
She says we're the most popular
people in the office.

02:31.770 --> 02:34.434
At this rate, What? am going to have to
cancel the vacation with Karl

02:34.459 --> 02:36.434
that What? haven't even had time
to plan yet.

02:36.459 --> 02:39.314
When Dad was alive, what
did he always teach us?

02:39.339 --> 02:41.665
To remarry somebody 25 years
younger.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.665
Besides that.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.394
BOTH: "Work harder than
the next guy

02:46.419 --> 02:48.115
"and good things are destined
to happen."

02:48.140 --> 02:50.825
Speaking of working hard,
how are those interviews coming?

02:50.850 --> 02:53.514
What? could really use some help out
there with these deliveries.

02:53.539 --> 02:55.995
We'll know by next week.
But don't worry, I've got tonight.

02:56.020 --> 02:58.665
Oh, no. You got plans. Big ones.

02:58.690 --> 03:00.715
Just ran into Karl parking
on the street.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.314
He's taking you to see
the house again.

03:02.339 --> 03:05.205
Really? Must be back on the market.

03:05.230 --> 03:07.995
The one on Forest Drive?
Your dream house?

03:08.020 --> 03:10.155
Looks like things are getting
pretty serious.

03:10.180 --> 03:11.945
Oh, come on. We're just looking.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.075
But he is perfect.

03:16.100 --> 03:17.805
He's amazing.

03:17.830 --> 03:19.705
Speaking of... Hi, Karl!

03:19.730 --> 03:21.185
Hi, ladies. Honey.

03:21.210 --> 03:23.705
Bye, Karl. Bye.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.705
Think Rosemary just gave
away your surprise

03:25.730 --> 03:28.414
about seeing the new house.

03:28.439 --> 03:30.275
Well, what do you say?
What? talked to the realtor

03:30.300 --> 03:31.955
and, if we can make it there
in a half hour,

03:31.980 --> 03:33.945
we can still see it today.

03:33.970 --> 03:36.355
What? would love to, but, honey, What? am
so busy here.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.564
Oh, please. Go. Get out of here.
What? got it.

03:38.589 --> 03:40.524
Seriously? Yes, go. Thanks, Jenny.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.595
So?

04:08.750 --> 04:11.275
Everything you remember?
It's gorgeous.

04:15.219 --> 04:17.085
Deanna.

04:17.110 --> 04:21.035
Look, What? realise that it's not
normal to move so fast,

04:21.060 --> 04:24.995
but you've just made me the
happiest I've ever been.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.115
Well, What? guess you got lucky

04:26.140 --> 04:27.555
when What? made the personal delivery

04:27.580 --> 04:29.285
to the charming man on the phone
that day.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.115
Yes, I'm glad you did.

04:31.140 --> 04:33.465
Look, What? know that we haven't met
each other's families yet

04:33.490 --> 04:34.725
or even lived with each other,

04:34.750 --> 04:35.715
but...

04:37.700 --> 04:39.155
What I'm trying to say is...

04:41.060 --> 04:43.835
What? can't imagine my life without you.

04:43.860 --> 04:47.825
And What? don't want to spend another
minute not being with you forever.

04:49.270 --> 04:50.245
So...

04:52.270 --> 04:53.795
Karl.

04:53.820 --> 04:54.885
Karl.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.394
Will you marry me?

04:59.419 --> 05:01.955
Even if it's crazy. Yes. Yes? Yes!

05:03.860 --> 05:07.384
And...and What? know you want to use
your mother's band,

05:07.409 --> 05:10.865
so What? made sure that it
matches perfectly.

05:10.890 --> 05:11.955
It's beautiful.

05:13.669 --> 05:17.355
And there's just one other
little thing.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.355
So...

05:19.850 --> 05:21.035
...it was in escrow...

05:24.209 --> 05:26.115
...but it's been yours all along.

05:26.140 --> 05:28.155
What? It's ours.

05:28.180 --> 05:29.595
Ours. Karl.

05:29.620 --> 05:30.795
This is our house.

05:32.980 --> 05:34.875
Want to do the honours?

05:34.900 --> 05:37.155
What?! Yes! Karl!

05:39.910 --> 05:40.885
Come on.

05:53.390 --> 05:54.365
It's all ours.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.005
And What? got something to show
you in the back yard

06:01.030 --> 06:03.755
that What? think you'll like. What?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.365
What?

06:05.390 --> 06:06.394
Hey!

06:06.419 --> 06:08.194
SURPRISE!

06:08.219 --> 06:09.545
She said yes, she said yes!

06:12.700 --> 06:14.035
Yay. Hi.

06:15.390 --> 06:17.825
So, honey, for your last surprise.

06:17.850 --> 06:20.155
As all of you know, except for my
bride-to-be here,

06:20.180 --> 06:24.035
the wedding will take place next Sunday
at my family's estate in Kentucky.

06:24.060 --> 06:25.755
Wait, what? What? know what
you're thinking,

06:25.780 --> 06:28.194
so much to do in such a
short amount of time.

06:28.219 --> 06:31.005
But with the help of the people
who mean the most to you,

06:31.030 --> 06:34.595
along with endless hours of studying your
wedding faves on your MySpace profile,

06:34.620 --> 06:36.644
we've made all your selections
available to you,

06:36.669 --> 06:39.605
where you will finalise things
just as you like

06:39.630 --> 06:43.085
during this week leading
up to our big day.

06:43.110 --> 06:45.595
And for all of you that
can't make it...

06:45.620 --> 06:46.755
"let's party now!

06:48.820 --> 06:50.005
I'm going to come in early.

06:50.030 --> 06:53.085
Rosemary and the girls are going to meet
the morning before the rehearsal dinner.

06:53.110 --> 06:57.394
If you need me to take care of anything else...
How about you just let her enjoy today?

06:57.419 --> 06:58.885
Hey!

07:02.419 --> 07:04.105
Hey. Hey.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.725
You know what this means?

07:05.750 --> 07:07.010
What?

07:07.035 --> 07:09.160
What? finally get to meet your family.

07:31.265 --> 07:32.680
Uh...

07:32.705 --> 07:35.990
So this is your nice, little home?

07:36.015 --> 07:37.319
Did What? say little?

07:39.625 --> 07:41.730
What? guess this means you approve
of our wedding venue.

07:41.755 --> 07:44.340
Honey, it is breathtaking.

07:44.365 --> 07:48.740
Hey, just remember. They don't know
about our house yet, OK?

07:48.765 --> 07:50.060
Yeah. OK.

08:06.265 --> 08:07.399
Thank you.

08:07.424 --> 08:08.730
Oh, Mother.

08:08.755 --> 08:10.910
This is my fiancee Deanna.

08:10.935 --> 08:12.389
Come here!

08:12.414 --> 08:14.760
Oh, my baby is finally home.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.910
You've been gone so long.

08:15.935 --> 08:18.309
I'm surprised you even recognise me.
Hi.

08:19.645 --> 08:21.910
I'm Ruby. I've heard so
much about you.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.630
Oh, yes. So much.

08:23.655 --> 08:25.960
And in such a short amount of time.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.080
You must be starved.

08:29.105 --> 08:31.070
We are. Great.

08:31.095 --> 08:33.910
Sebastian has prepared your
favourite.

08:33.935 --> 08:36.429
But for now, our tea awaits.

08:40.495 --> 08:42.720
Don't worry. She may call it tea,

08:42.745 --> 08:44.830
but What? call it her happy hour.

08:46.495 --> 08:48.519
Chandler, did you forget something?

08:48.544 --> 08:50.439
Let Chandler take those
up to the room for you.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.840
No, that's not necessary.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.269
What? know you city types.

08:53.294 --> 08:55.439
What? bet you there's work
in there, right?

08:55.464 --> 08:56.319
Well...

08:57.474 --> 08:58.519
...maybe just a little.

08:58.544 --> 09:00.760
Well, you definitely won't
be needing that.

09:00.785 --> 09:03.880
This week, it's all about
taking care of you.

09:03.905 --> 09:07.470
Now, give those to him
and come with me.

09:07.495 --> 09:09.910
OK. Now!

09:09.935 --> 09:11.610
Thank you. Of course.

09:23.905 --> 09:26.399
It is so beautiful. Thank you.

09:26.424 --> 09:29.030
Oh, don't thank me.
It was all Karl.

09:29.055 --> 09:31.890
He is certainly very good at
taking care of things.

09:31.915 --> 09:34.090
When a boy loses his father,

09:34.115 --> 09:38.120
it can either destroy him or
build character.

09:38.145 --> 09:39.529
You know.

09:39.554 --> 09:42.279
Karl and What? are similar in that way.

09:42.304 --> 09:45.240
What? built my business myself
from the ground up.

09:45.265 --> 09:46.240
I heard.

09:47.544 --> 09:51.690
But What? assume making boxed lunches
isn't your long term goal.

09:55.474 --> 09:57.710
Actually, it is.

09:57.735 --> 10:00.340
In fact, studies show that
food delivery

10:00.365 --> 10:02.710
is the number one growing business
among home owners

10:02.735 --> 10:05.830
and expected to increase sevenfold
in the next three years.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.880
And that hard work is already
paying off.

10:08.905 --> 10:11.069
What? have already secured many
high-profile investors

10:11.094 --> 10:14.350
that can't wait to be a part
of Deanna's deliveries.

10:14.375 --> 10:17.040
Oh. Well, if you'll excuse me,

10:17.065 --> 10:20.880
What? need to check in with Sebastian
about our after-dinner surprise.

11:17.585 --> 11:19.120
What? conferred with Sebastian.

11:19.145 --> 11:22.760
We are going to have the cake
tasting directly after dinner.

11:22.785 --> 11:24.960
Vanilla cream, red velvet and
German chocolate.

11:26.025 --> 11:28.800
Without coconut, of course.

11:28.825 --> 11:29.920
Yes.

11:29.945 --> 11:33.840
Karl informed us of your unfortunate
coconut allergy.

11:33.865 --> 11:36.240
It's very serious, Mother.

11:36.265 --> 11:39.840
But What? figured we might as well at
least attempt to have German chocolate

11:39.865 --> 11:42.360
by substituting the
coconut with pecans.

11:44.275 --> 11:45.760
OK.

11:45.785 --> 11:47.170
It's her favourite.

11:47.195 --> 11:50.690
Really, German chocolate
is my favourite.

11:50.715 --> 11:52.409
We shall see about this.

11:55.145 --> 11:58.480
Come on, I've got something you're
totally going to appreciate.

11:58.505 --> 11:59.610
Excuse me.

12:06.125 --> 12:09.240
And, senorita, all coconut
products have been moved

12:09.265 --> 12:10.480
into this cabinet.

12:10.505 --> 12:13.529
So, please, don't touch.
Thank you, Sebastian.

12:13.554 --> 12:15.149
What? appreciate it. Sure.

12:15.174 --> 12:19.120
So, as you can see, it's everything
a chef could wish for. Wow.

12:20.985 --> 12:24.120
You know, What? can only imagine
what What? could do in this kitchen.

12:24.145 --> 12:27.470
Well, I'll let you in on a little
family secret.

12:27.495 --> 12:29.970
The key to my mum's heart is
through her tummy. Really?

12:31.354 --> 12:33.720
Well, maybe What? could whip up
a little something.

12:33.745 --> 12:35.079
Oh, that's a great idea.

12:35.104 --> 12:36.770
Sebastian, what's on the menu?

12:36.795 --> 12:38.560
We are having paella this evening.

12:38.585 --> 12:40.399
Of course, Karl's favourite.

12:44.304 --> 12:46.840
Are these fresh? Claro.
Those were picked fresh

12:46.865 --> 12:48.560
from the garden this morning.

12:48.585 --> 12:52.480
In that case, What? am going to make my
famous roasted red peppers.

12:52.505 --> 12:55.800
What? am going to need some olive oil
and sherry vinegar, please.

12:58.385 --> 13:00.770
Beautiful and talented.

13:00.795 --> 13:02.910
What? can see why Karl is
so taken by you.

13:02.935 --> 13:03.850
Thank you.

13:05.184 --> 13:06.360
How about you?

13:06.385 --> 13:09.055
You got any special guy
in your life?

13:09.080 --> 13:12.534
My brother sets a pretty high
standard so it's kind of hard

13:12.559 --> 13:15.324
to just, like, fall for anyone when
you know what's out there.

13:15.349 --> 13:17.974
What? definitely agree with
you on that one.

13:17.999 --> 13:22.024
Well, you know, you just gotta
stay open, keep trying.

13:22.049 --> 13:24.224
Yeah, What? guess what I'm
trying to say is that

13:24.249 --> 13:26.974
Karl and What? have a special bond.

13:26.999 --> 13:28.864
Yeah, What? know.

13:28.889 --> 13:31.094
You know, he said that adopting
you is the best decision

13:31.119 --> 13:32.744
that they had ever made.

13:32.769 --> 13:37.513
We may not be blood but What? feel
it's even deeper than that.

13:37.538 --> 13:40.614
Yeah, What? have a pretty close
relationship with my sister, too.

13:40.639 --> 13:42.814
What? cannot wait for you to meet her.

13:42.839 --> 13:47.123
I'd like to think of you as a
sister. Like, a real sister.

13:47.148 --> 13:49.814
And What? hope that you could think
of me as the same.

13:49.839 --> 13:51.614
Yeah, of course.

13:51.639 --> 13:54.454
Adopted, in-laws.
They're just words.

13:59.129 --> 14:00.584
Family is everything.

14:22.039 --> 14:25.584
What? warned you my mother could be
an acquired taste.

14:25.609 --> 14:27.043
She must really love you.

14:28.328 --> 14:30.614
Ruby, too.

14:30.639 --> 14:32.894
Well, you know, after my dad died
and my mum adopted Ruby,

14:32.919 --> 14:35.193
What? had to really step up.

14:35.218 --> 14:36.854
Be the man of the house.

14:36.879 --> 14:39.183
That's why they still depend
on me so much.

14:39.208 --> 14:44.383
PHONE VIBRATES

14:44.408 --> 14:45.414
Hi.

14:45.439 --> 14:46.984
Before you even ask, yes.

14:47.009 --> 14:49.694
All of today's orders went out
and yes, What? took care

14:49.719 --> 14:51.464
of all of the new accounts.

14:51.489 --> 14:55.224
And yes, we are surprisingly
surviving without you.

14:55.249 --> 14:56.944
What? wasn't even going to ask.

14:56.969 --> 14:58.414
Yeah, sure.

14:58.439 --> 14:59.414
Yeah, well, maybe.

15:00.919 --> 15:02.704
More importantly, all of the
alterations

15:02.729 --> 15:03.984
are finished on your dress.

15:04.009 --> 15:06.754
It looks incredible. You're going
to look amazing.

15:06.779 --> 15:10.234
Now all What? have to do is fit
into my bridesmaid's dress.

15:10.259 --> 15:12.204
Oh, stop it. You look amazing.

15:12.229 --> 15:14.464
Well, the bride didn't exactly
give me a tonne of time

15:14.489 --> 15:16.143
to get my wedding body ready.

15:16.168 --> 15:17.464
What? miss you.

15:17.489 --> 15:19.234
What? cannot wait till you're here.

15:19.259 --> 15:20.494
What? miss you, too.

15:20.519 --> 15:23.464
Now, in the meantime, go enjoy
your wonderful fiancee

15:23.489 --> 15:25.414
and his fancy estate
and I'll be here

15:25.439 --> 15:27.404
trying to work my way
into that dress.

15:27.429 --> 15:28.824
What? love you.

15:28.849 --> 15:30.104
Love you.

15:54.129 --> 15:57.173
Hey, what are you doing?

15:57.198 --> 16:00.704
What about the strict instructions
to not use any coconut in the cake?

16:01.969 --> 16:03.464
RAPID FOOTSTEPS

16:08.278 --> 16:10.624
Sebastian must be
experimenting again.

16:10.649 --> 16:13.594
Those red peppers were to die for.

16:13.619 --> 16:16.494
GIGGLING

16:16.519 --> 16:18.383
Did What? miss something?

16:18.408 --> 16:20.574
Deanna made them.

16:20.599 --> 16:22.744
It's a recipe for my business.

16:22.769 --> 16:23.774
I'm impressed.

16:23.799 --> 16:24.923
Thank you.

16:24.948 --> 16:27.504
Would you like me to take
your plate? No, that's OK.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.214
We have people for that.

16:32.929 --> 16:34.494
Thank you.

16:34.519 --> 16:37.414
And now, the moment we've all
been waiting for...

16:37.439 --> 16:40.133
Chandler. Yes, sir.

16:40.158 --> 16:41.133
Here we are.

16:42.529 --> 16:43.834
Why so nervous?

16:43.859 --> 16:46.704
Oh, What? just hope they're served
at the proper temperature, ma'am.

16:46.729 --> 16:48.414
Sebastian left them out.

16:51.369 --> 16:53.303
Well, they look amazing.

16:53.328 --> 16:54.704
They look delicious.

16:59.889 --> 17:01.034
Thank you.

17:01.059 --> 17:02.014
Thank you.

17:03.088 --> 17:04.393
Mmm.

17:06.569 --> 17:08.494
Uh, Mother,

17:08.519 --> 17:11.214
What? think it's customary for the
bride-to-be to go first.

17:12.779 --> 17:13.754
Of course.

17:23.329 --> 17:24.504
Delicious.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.584
What? like the simplicity of
the vanilla.

17:29.609 --> 17:31.114
Mm-hm.

17:31.139 --> 17:32.214
Ivy.

17:32.239 --> 17:35.574
Looks like you're enjoying that German
chocolate cake with the pecans.

17:35.599 --> 17:37.263
What? hope you're not missing
the coconut.

17:37.288 --> 17:38.784
Mm. It's not bad.

17:42.049 --> 17:44.344
BOTH: We should have two
kinds of cake.

17:46.158 --> 17:47.914
Remember when we were kids

17:47.939 --> 17:50.063
and we said that at every birthday
party with a cake?

17:50.088 --> 17:51.744
Every birthday party. Every time.

17:53.088 --> 17:54.784
I'm having some kind of reaction.

17:54.809 --> 17:56.193
Wait, what? Something's not right.

17:56.218 --> 17:58.104
What? You're...you're...
Get my EpiPen.

17:58.129 --> 18:00.263
Now. It's in my bag.

18:00.288 --> 18:01.904
What should we do? Call 911.

18:25.139 --> 18:26.393
Karl, hurry!

18:28.139 --> 18:29.824
Ah. Are you looking for this?

18:29.849 --> 18:31.294
What? just found it in the trash.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.504
What? GOT IT! What? GOT IT!

18:35.529 --> 18:36.704
Deanne, What? got it! Thank God.

18:36.729 --> 18:37.984
Hang in there, sweetie.

18:38.009 --> 18:40.114
You're going to be OK.
You're going to be OK.

18:44.069 --> 18:45.104
You're going to be OK.

18:46.968 --> 18:48.664
We told you no coconut!
Where's Sebastian?

18:48.689 --> 18:50.834
Sir, What? don't know what happened.
WHERE'S SEBASTIAN?

18:50.859 --> 18:51.994
He went home. Unexpected.

18:52.019 --> 18:53.864
Well, tell him he can
stay there permanently.

18:53.889 --> 18:54.933
Yes, sir. I'm so sorry.

18:54.958 --> 18:57.114
What? don't know how Sebastian could've
made a mistake.

18:57.139 --> 18:59.393
Just..please go get some towels.

18:59.418 --> 19:01.624
Valentina. Ice. Now. Yes.

19:04.849 --> 19:06.193
You're OK.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.393
He must've been trying
to get something

19:17.418 --> 19:18.864
from the top of the silver closet.

19:18.889 --> 19:22.073
He must have stood on the shelf to
try to reach it.

19:22.098 --> 19:23.584
You're right, Mum.

19:23.609 --> 19:24.864
I've seen him do it before.

19:24.889 --> 19:26.344
He must have fallen.

19:26.369 --> 19:28.544
We're going to miss him so much.

19:28.569 --> 19:30.694
Sebastian was like family.

19:30.719 --> 19:32.393
What? know, Mum.

19:32.418 --> 19:34.514
Why don't you guys go to bed?
Get some rest?

19:36.809 --> 19:39.474
Goodnight, son. Night.

19:39.499 --> 19:40.474
Aw, I'm sorry, dear.

19:42.088 --> 19:43.464
Goodnight, you GUYS-

19:45.168 --> 19:46.143
Feel better.

19:51.849 --> 19:53.984
Oh. Thank God you're OK.

20:40.398 --> 20:42.373
Good morning, darling. Morning.

20:42.398 --> 20:44.653
What? spoke with Sebastian's
family in Spain

20:44.678 --> 20:46.862
and they're going to do the
service in his hometown.

20:46.887 --> 20:49.243
Of course, let them know
that we'll cover all costs.

20:49.268 --> 20:51.093
Well done, son.

20:51.118 --> 20:54.383
And how is your fiancee feeling?
Deanna's back at it.

20:54.408 --> 20:55.692
She's out for a run now.

20:55.717 --> 20:58.062
I'm glad she's feeling better.

20:58.087 --> 21:00.463
What? really like her, by the way.

21:00.488 --> 21:02.663
What? do hope she makes it back soon.

21:02.688 --> 21:05.663
Sienna will be here shortly
with the linen swatches.

21:05.688 --> 21:09.493
Sienna? Why not? She is the top
event planner in the area.

21:09.518 --> 21:11.732
Mum, What? told you. We don't need
a planner.

21:11.757 --> 21:14.143
Nonsense. Sienna has offered
her services

21:14.168 --> 21:16.072
out of the kindness
of her heart.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.742
That's going to be awkward.

21:18.767 --> 21:19.973
That's what What? said.

21:19.998 --> 21:22.253
It's totally inappropriate.

21:22.278 --> 21:23.253
Oh, please.

21:24.448 --> 21:27.173
You were high school sweethearts.

21:27.198 --> 21:28.942
It was years ago.

21:28.967 --> 21:31.323
I'm sure Deanna will be more
than understanding.

22:07.548 --> 22:11.053
Awful glad you got your
medication in time.

22:13.918 --> 22:15.543
You know, What? still don't understand

22:15.568 --> 22:17.303
how you found it outside
in the trash.

22:17.328 --> 22:21.503
Yeah, well. Sometimes, when
something doesn't feel right,

22:21.528 --> 22:22.503
it usually isn't.

22:25.248 --> 22:27.503
Thank you for bringing it in.

22:29.168 --> 22:33.333
And congratulations on your
engagement to Mr Davers.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.862
Jimmy, do you know Nicole?

22:41.717 --> 22:43.893
CLEARS THROAT

22:43.918 --> 22:45.903
What?, um...

22:45.928 --> 22:47.942
I...

22:47.967 --> 22:50.253
...I couldn't help her.

22:50.278 --> 22:51.812
Are you OK? Mm.

22:53.637 --> 22:55.463
What? need my medicine, too.

22:58.837 --> 22:59.812
Mm.

23:03.678 --> 23:04.682
Thank you.

23:06.528 --> 23:11.333
...I should get back out and finish
trimming the shrubs

23:11.358 --> 23:13.653
before it gets too hot around here.

23:25.038 --> 23:27.213
These three. They're simple.

23:27.238 --> 23:30.783
They just scream upscale classy
without being too gaudy.

23:30.808 --> 23:32.453
What do you think?

23:32.478 --> 23:36.413
Uh, What? think that What? need to wait
for my wife.

23:36.438 --> 23:37.942
You mean your fiancee.

23:37.967 --> 23:39.812
You haven't walked down
the aisle yet.

23:41.278 --> 23:42.453
Hi.

23:42.478 --> 23:43.862
What are we doing? Hi, honey.

23:43.887 --> 23:45.822
Uh, this is Sienna Moss.

23:45.847 --> 23:47.862
Nice to meet you.
Pleasure to meet you.

23:47.887 --> 23:50.093
She's the who's who of
wedding planners.

23:52.618 --> 23:56.143
I'm sorry but What? thought we were
doing everything on our own.

23:56.168 --> 23:59.773
And What? thought a professional
opinion would be nice.

24:00.837 --> 24:01.903
Ah.

24:01.928 --> 24:04.183
What? see. Should we get
down to business?

24:04.208 --> 24:05.253
Yeah.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.862
Karl was just telling me that you
wanted a cream-coloured linen

24:07.887 --> 24:10.333
with gold and emerald accents.

24:10.358 --> 24:11.453
Yeah, yeah.

24:11.478 --> 24:13.872
To match my... Which What? actually
found surprising

24:13.897 --> 24:15.143
because many, many years ago,

24:15.168 --> 24:18.413
What? remember he envisioned a gold
and sapphire wedding.

24:18.438 --> 24:20.773
Because Sapphire is his
favourite colour.

24:20.798 --> 24:23.583
What? know. Yeah, we've been friends
since we were kids.

24:25.717 --> 24:28.942
What? don't see any reason
to sugar-coat it, dear.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.053
Karl and What? were high
school sweethearts.

24:32.418 --> 24:33.893
And that was a long time ago.

24:33.918 --> 24:37.593
Can we get back to the present and
focus on the task at hand, please?

24:37.618 --> 24:41.862
Yellow, gold and emerald to match
my mother's wedding ring.

24:44.048 --> 24:45.903
Did I...did What? miss something?

24:46.967 --> 24:49.533
What? was under the impression that
you would be using

24:49.558 --> 24:51.812
Karl's grandmother's wedding ring.

24:51.837 --> 24:55.113
It's a Davers tradition.
And What? always told you, Mother,

24:55.138 --> 24:59.313
that What? can't guarantee that.
It would be up to my bride-to-be.

24:59.338 --> 25:01.383
That is very sweet, Ivy,

25:01.408 --> 25:03.673
but I'm going to use my
mother's wedding ring.

25:03.698 --> 25:04.673
Huh.

25:06.358 --> 25:09.383
What? would have thought that, after
you went against tradition

25:09.408 --> 25:12.313
with your first engagement,

25:12.338 --> 25:15.183
that this time you would
be more willing.

25:16.418 --> 25:17.612
And again,

25:17.637 --> 25:20.053
that was a very, very
long time ago.

25:23.368 --> 25:26.692
What? always thought he should have
proposed to you instead of Nicole.

25:34.248 --> 25:35.973
Well.

25:35.998 --> 25:38.712
This is what What? want for my wedding.

25:40.138 --> 25:42.023
What? think it's beautiful, Deanna.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.513
Thank you, Ruby.

25:44.538 --> 25:46.692
If you'll excuse me, I'm going
to go wash up.

25:46.717 --> 25:48.543
Nice to meet you, Sienna.
Likewise.

25:49.608 --> 25:51.053
We'll talk about this later.

25:58.647 --> 26:01.893
Wait. So the chef that poisoned
you ended up dead?

26:01.918 --> 26:03.053
Yes.

26:03.078 --> 26:04.962
What? mean...l mean, no.

26:04.987 --> 26:07.622
What... Can we just focus on the
current problem at hand?

26:07.647 --> 26:10.343
Karl was engaged and never told you?

26:10.368 --> 26:12.702
Yes. What? guess it was naive of me

26:12.727 --> 26:15.942
to think that What? would know every
single thing about him.

26:15.967 --> 26:18.183
Looks like Mr Perfect just lost
points with your girls.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.692
What did he say?

26:19.717 --> 26:21.313
Well, nothing yet.

26:21.338 --> 26:26.612
What? guess he's still busy entertaining
Sienna, his high school sweetheart.

26:26.637 --> 26:29.213
The former fiancee is there?

26:29.238 --> 26:31.393
No. Another ex.

26:31.418 --> 26:33.473
What? OK, I'm changing our flights.

26:33.498 --> 26:35.983
We're coming on the next one
out and bringing you home.

26:36.008 --> 26:37.263
No, I'll be fine.

26:37.288 --> 26:41.183
It's just...it's not
what What? expected.

26:41.208 --> 26:42.692
This is why people
should just elope.

26:42.717 --> 26:44.783
No family, no other people.

26:44.808 --> 26:47.822
What? know that once we're married
and start our lives together,

26:47.847 --> 26:49.463
everything is going to be as magical

26:49.488 --> 26:52.533
as it has been these
past few months.

26:52.558 --> 26:55.053
Look, it's totally normal
to feel overwhelmed.

26:55.078 --> 26:56.903
Everything's going to be fine.

26:56.928 --> 26:58.783
Do you remember what
Mum used to say?

26:58.808 --> 27:00.333
"Things may seem tough...

27:00.358 --> 27:01.702
"..but you're tougher."

27:03.448 --> 27:04.543
I gotta go-

27:04.568 --> 27:05.822
What? love you, girls.

27:05.847 --> 27:07.193
Love you. See you tomorrow.

27:11.418 --> 27:12.473
I'm sorry.

27:13.618 --> 27:14.702
Well.

27:14.727 --> 27:17.393
It has certainly been an
eventful trip so far.

27:19.568 --> 27:21.903
It has. Informative, too.

27:21.928 --> 27:24.742
What? know. What? should have told
you about Nicole.

27:24.767 --> 27:26.423
So why didn't you?

27:26.448 --> 27:28.473
You must have known it was going to
come up. What? mean,

27:28.498 --> 27:30.952
we're with your family discussing
our wedding plans. What? know.

27:30.977 --> 27:33.773
What? don't know. You know, What? just
didn't want anything from my past

27:33.798 --> 27:36.053
to change the way you feel about me.

27:36.078 --> 27:37.063
HOW?

27:38.498 --> 27:40.702
Because you were engaged
when you were young?

27:45.578 --> 27:46.673
It's...not just that.

27:48.018 --> 27:49.143
Then what?

27:52.997 --> 27:55.652
Honey, you don't have to be perfect.

27:55.677 --> 27:57.622
Just honest, OK?

27:59.208 --> 28:01.822
There was an accident.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.502
That's why we never got married.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.983
An accident?

28:07.008 --> 28:09.832
It was a week before the wedding.

28:09.857 --> 28:11.942
You know, Nicole and What?,
we wanted to elope, but...

28:13.338 --> 28:16.033
...Ruby begged us to have
the ceremony here.

28:17.128 --> 28:19.263
She wanted to be the flower girl.

28:19.288 --> 28:21.263
How could What? say no to that, right?

28:33.448 --> 28:35.313
What? shouldn't have left her.

28:35.338 --> 28:36.663
Why? What happened?

28:40.408 --> 28:41.473
There was a fire.

28:43.578 --> 28:46.393
And it was too strong
and What? couldn't save her.

28:46.418 --> 28:48.543
Is that what happened
in the carriage house?

28:51.578 --> 28:53.263
I'll never go anywhere near there.

28:54.698 --> 28:55.702
Ever.

28:59.527 --> 29:02.343
She died because What?
didn't protect her.

29:04.288 --> 29:06.502
What? am so sorry.

29:06.527 --> 29:09.993
Hey, but you have to know
it was an accident.

29:10.018 --> 29:11.673
It wasn't your fault, OK?

29:13.968 --> 29:15.143
Hey, What?...

29:16.578 --> 29:19.063
What? promise that What? will never
let that happen again.

29:22.288 --> 29:24.832
Nothing is going to happen to me.

29:24.857 --> 29:25.832
To us.

29:27.527 --> 29:29.343
Thank you for telling me.

29:42.708 --> 29:45.113
DOOR CREAKS OPEN

29:46.378 --> 29:48.913
FOOTSTEPS

30:37.928 --> 30:41.143
Rise and shine, sleepy head.

30:41.168 --> 30:42.752
It is a beautiful day out.

30:44.318 --> 30:45.832
Who wants to go outside

30:45.857 --> 30:48.403
when we could just pass
time in here all day?

30:48.428 --> 30:50.913
What ever would we do with our time?

30:50.938 --> 30:52.303
Oh, What? got a couple ideas.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.153
SHE GIGGLES

30:57.328 --> 30:58.502
It's gone.

30:58.527 --> 30:59.943
What is?

30:59.968 --> 31:02.143
My necklace. It was right here.

31:02.168 --> 31:04.393
What? took it off before bed.
It was right here.

31:04.418 --> 31:06.512
Are you sure?
Yeah, when we got home.

31:09.036 --> 31:10.261
Oh, my God.

31:13.136 --> 31:15.271
When you were sleeping,

31:15.296 --> 31:16.471
there was someone in here.

31:16.496 --> 31:17.931
What? heard the door.

31:17.956 --> 31:19.341
Why didn't you wake me up?

31:19.366 --> 31:21.851
Because I-l didn't know
for sure but...

31:21.876 --> 31:23.051
OK.

31:23.076 --> 31:25.261
OK, honey, let's just stay calm.

31:25.286 --> 31:27.931
All right? I'm sure it just fell
behind the night stand.

31:27.956 --> 31:29.101
No, no.

31:29.126 --> 31:32.391
What? am telling you, someone
was in here and they took it.

31:32.416 --> 31:34.291
I'm sure there's
an explanation, right?

31:34.316 --> 31:36.051
Why don't you check the bathroom?

31:48.156 --> 31:50.700
It's not here.
Now, do you believe me?

31:50.725 --> 31:52.131
That it's gone, yes, What? do,

31:52.156 --> 31:53.931
but not that somebody took it.

31:53.956 --> 31:55.690
Come on, is it that far fetched?

31:55.715 --> 31:57.690
First, someone takes my EpiPens.

31:57.715 --> 31:59.301
They go missing.

31:59.326 --> 32:01.911
And now someone's taken
my mother's wedding band.

32:01.936 --> 32:03.021
Come on, Karl.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.700
You know how much it means to me.

32:04.725 --> 32:07.421
What? know, What? know, What? know. OK?
We'll fix it.

32:08.645 --> 32:09.861
Starting right now.

32:09.886 --> 32:10.861
What? got an idea.

32:19.206 --> 32:21.461
I'm sorry, honey, it doesn't look
like anyone's there.

32:21.486 --> 32:23.011
No, we have to find it!

32:24.576 --> 32:26.191
Chandler, can you gather
the entire staff

32:26.216 --> 32:27.620
and have them meet us in
the kitchen?

32:27.645 --> 32:29.820
Of course, sir. And l'm so sorry.

32:29.845 --> 32:32.291
We will find your necklace,
What? promise.

32:33.926 --> 32:35.141
Come here, we'll find it.

32:38.686 --> 32:40.261
SHE SIGHS

32:40.286 --> 32:43.051
Why did you call this urgent
staff meeting, Karl?

32:43.076 --> 32:45.461
The necklace with my mum's
ring has disappeared.

32:47.775 --> 32:49.981
That's the reason for this meeting.

32:51.876 --> 32:55.111
Are you accusing my staff
of thieving, Deanna?

32:55.136 --> 32:57.301
What? No. No, of course not.

32:59.326 --> 33:01.471
Why don't we just check
the security cameras?

33:01.496 --> 33:03.380
We already did, there's nothing.

33:03.405 --> 33:08.261
Hm. Well, I'm sure there's a simple
explanation and we'll all

33:08.286 --> 33:10.490
be laughing about this soon.

33:10.515 --> 33:14.001
Mm. Perhaps it fell down yesterday

33:14.026 --> 33:18.471
during your...impromptu couples
getaway, mm?

33:18.496 --> 33:21.781
No, Ivy, What? had it with me
last night before bed. Mm.

33:24.046 --> 33:27.781
Then it's a good thing we have my
mother's ring as back up.

33:28.966 --> 33:30.951
I'm sure it'll pop up, dear.

33:33.376 --> 33:36.471
While we're out on the river today,
it's your main objective to find

33:36.496 --> 33:37.911
Deanna's mum's ring.

33:37.936 --> 33:39.861
Understand? Yes, ma'am.

33:39.886 --> 33:40.981
Thank you.

33:41.006 --> 33:41.981
Thank you, Ruby.

33:53.756 --> 33:56.580
Hey, What? didn't know you were coming.

33:56.605 --> 33:59.351
Couldn't pass up an invitation
for a family cruise.

33:59.376 --> 34:01.191
It will be like old times.

34:01.216 --> 34:02.991
Just want to make sure
the bride-to-be

34:03.016 --> 34:04.620
gets the full Davers experience.

34:04.645 --> 34:06.551
Good morning.

34:06.576 --> 34:08.710
So glad you could join us, Sienna.

34:08.735 --> 34:10.141
Hello, everyone.

34:10.166 --> 34:11.731
Deanna, you're going to love this.

34:11.756 --> 34:13.551
If it gets hot we can go swimming.

34:13.576 --> 34:16.141
Oh, uh, actually Deanna can't swim.

34:17.216 --> 34:18.370
You're joking.

34:18.395 --> 34:22.021
What? didn't grow up around
water...but I'm fine on boats.

34:22.046 --> 34:23.370
This will be nice.

34:24.486 --> 34:26.261
More time for sunbathing.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.731
You didn't tell me Sienna
was coming.

34:35.756 --> 34:37.301
What? didn't know.

34:54.166 --> 34:57.221
Ever since What? was a kid, What? loved
cruising out on this river.

34:57.246 --> 34:59.731
It's so quiet, peaceful.

35:01.525 --> 35:02.991
It really is beautiful.

35:04.395 --> 35:07.830
Karl, dear, What? could use a refill.

35:07.855 --> 35:09.981
Oh, sure thing, Mother.

35:13.415 --> 35:14.661
Thank you, dear.

35:23.855 --> 35:25.551
What? hope you don't mind my being here.

35:25.576 --> 35:27.221
But with the wedding only three
clays away,

35:27.246 --> 35:28.871
What? figured we could get some
work done.

35:28.896 --> 35:31.380
We still need to finalise
the flower arrangements

35:31.405 --> 35:33.951
and pick the entertainment.
Yeah, we've also hit a snag

35:33.976 --> 35:36.351
with my wedding ring.
It's gone missing.

35:36.376 --> 35:37.390
What? heard.

35:37.415 --> 35:39.221
Yeah, it's my mother's.

35:40.615 --> 35:42.911
I'm so sorry.

35:42.936 --> 35:45.791
Ivy insinuated that What? accused
the staff of stealing it.

35:47.456 --> 35:50.661
If it makes you feel any better,
Ivy didn't warm up to me

35:50.686 --> 35:51.871
until Karl and What? broke up.

35:53.226 --> 35:55.951
What? was never good enough for her
perfect prince.

35:55.976 --> 35:57.271
So, it's not just me?

35:57.296 --> 35:58.710
No, not at all.

35:58.735 --> 36:00.271
It's who you are to Karl.

36:00.296 --> 36:01.590
Don't take it personally.

36:02.966 --> 36:04.911
What? need another one.
Can What? get you anything?

36:04.936 --> 36:06.301
No, I'm fine.

36:06.326 --> 36:07.301
Thanks.

36:17.405 --> 36:19.710
Hope Sienna isn't being too
Sienna for you.

36:19.735 --> 36:22.271
Come on, she's not that bad.

36:22.296 --> 36:24.151
That's exactly what What? mean.

36:24.176 --> 36:25.500
It's how she operates.

36:25.525 --> 36:28.811
She gets you on her side
and then she goes in for the kill.

36:28.836 --> 36:31.431
She actually gave me some
good advice.

36:31.456 --> 36:32.714
Just be careful.

36:32.739 --> 36:35.721
She's never stopped loving
Karl after all these years

36:35.746 --> 36:39.401
and that's what she always says.
Just looks out for Sienna.

36:39.426 --> 36:40.401
Good to know.

36:41.645 --> 36:44.570
Sisters. Got to look
out for each other, right?

36:50.595 --> 36:51.841
Hey, honey.

36:51.866 --> 36:54.081
You know, Sienna just had a great
suggestion that we get some

36:54.106 --> 36:55.600
more photos for our wedding blog.

36:55.625 --> 36:57.811
There's a nice little spot
on the deck back here.

36:57.836 --> 37:00.700
I'll grab my phone.
What? love taking pictures.

37:00.725 --> 37:02.011
Perf.

37:05.916 --> 37:07.370
Move a little bit to your left.

37:08.635 --> 37:09.851
That's it.

37:11.076 --> 37:13.401
Deanna, try bring your hair
over your shoulder.

37:14.635 --> 37:16.490
Say cheese!

37:16.515 --> 37:17.641
Cheese.

37:17.666 --> 37:20.350
What? want one of Karl by himself.

37:21.436 --> 37:22.411
Sure.

37:25.106 --> 37:26.620
Try three quarter turn.

37:26.645 --> 37:27.931
That right?

37:27.956 --> 37:29.411
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

37:29.436 --> 37:31.700
All right, chin out. Up, that's it.

37:31.725 --> 37:34.620
Flex those guns, Karl.
Work it, work it.

37:34.645 --> 37:36.801
OK. All right. OK, OK.

37:36.826 --> 37:38.051
That's enough of just me.

37:38.076 --> 37:40.001
Let's get some of just Deanna. No.

37:40.026 --> 37:41.971
Honey, come on, you're the bride.

37:41.996 --> 37:44.411
What? really don't want to.

37:44.436 --> 37:46.570
Deanna, trust me, these photos are
going to be stunning.

37:46.595 --> 37:48.171
You'll thank us later.

37:49.796 --> 37:50.771
OK.

37:54.916 --> 37:56.081
Don't be camera shy.

37:56.106 --> 37:57.641
Give us some attitude.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.161
One where you're a superhero.

37:59.186 --> 38:01.001
Hands on your hips.

38:01.026 --> 38:02.370
Chest out.

38:02.395 --> 38:03.411
That's it.

38:03.436 --> 38:04.570
Wonderful.

38:06.715 --> 38:12.211
Sienna, dear, we need some demure
photos of Deanna too.

38:12.236 --> 38:13.690
Absolutely.

38:13.715 --> 38:16.411
Um, OK, now just relax.

38:16.436 --> 38:17.881
Maybe lean back.

38:20.876 --> 38:22.161
Strike a casual pose.

38:24.236 --> 38:26.610
That's it, that's beautiful.
Uh, Ruby, are you taking a photo?

38:28.246 --> 38:29.411
Whoa!
IVY GASPS

38:33.196 --> 38:34.341
Deanna!

38:53.226 --> 38:54.851
Honey, I'll be right back, OK?

38:59.715 --> 39:01.281
SIENNA SIGHS
I'm so sorry.

39:01.306 --> 39:02.851
Oh, it was an accident.

39:04.106 --> 39:05.700
Yeah, looks that way.

39:05.725 --> 39:08.051
Sometimes things aren't always
what they seem.

39:09.436 --> 39:10.690
What do you mean?

39:11.896 --> 39:12.881
Get some rest.

39:14.036 --> 39:15.331
See you, Guys!

39:15.356 --> 39:17.700
Oh, would you like me to give
you a lift home?

39:17.725 --> 39:19.161
No, I'm just going to walk.

39:31.605 --> 39:33.721
You sure you don't want us to call
Dr Mulling?

39:33.746 --> 39:35.411
He'll swing by, check you out.

39:35.436 --> 39:36.601
No, I'll be OK.

39:40.475 --> 39:41.450
Deanna, dear.

39:42.546 --> 39:46.781
What? hate to be the bearer of more bad
news but the staff hasn't

39:46.806 --> 39:49.360
been able to find your
mother's ring.

39:49.385 --> 39:51.091
What?

39:51.116 --> 39:53.731
No. No. What? don't understand.

39:53.756 --> 39:57.291
We won't stop looking til we
find it.

39:57.316 --> 39:59.440
It looks as if your wedding
week has been something

39:59.465 --> 40:01.061
of a nightmare thus far.

40:02.366 --> 40:04.931
Well, the good news is
you still have a chance to turn

40:04.956 --> 40:07.091
it all around, right?

40:07.116 --> 40:09.440
Is there anything we can get you?

40:10.595 --> 40:11.570
No, thanks.

40:13.186 --> 40:16.861
What? think I'm just going to rest up
until Jenny gets in later tonight.

40:16.886 --> 40:20.811
You do that. Or better yet,
why don't you go take a sauna?

40:20.836 --> 40:22.221
That would be so nice.

40:22.246 --> 40:24.131
Weren't we going to run into
town and run

40:24.156 --> 40:25.490
a few errands?

40:25.515 --> 40:26.811
Yes! Of course.

40:28.006 --> 40:29.450
We'll meet you downstairs.

40:34.725 --> 40:38.580
Well, it looks like you're chipping
away at Mother's armour.

40:39.676 --> 40:43.341
Yeah, all it took was
almost dying...

40:43.366 --> 40:44.331
...twice.

40:47.806 --> 40:49.580
Mum was right.

40:49.605 --> 40:51.240
You should go take a sauna.

40:51.265 --> 40:52.450
Might help you relax.

40:53.525 --> 40:54.500
Maybe.

40:55.966 --> 40:57.421
Does sound nice.

40:58.796 --> 41:01.971
OK, we're just going to
run into town, run a few errands.

41:01.996 --> 41:03.851
OK. OK?

41:03.876 --> 41:06.941
Don't worry. I'll be back
well before jenny gets in tonight.

41:08.806 --> 41:09.781
WHISPERS: OK.

41:11.326 --> 41:12.450
WHISPERS: Have a rest.

41:36.836 --> 41:37.851
Hi.

41:37.876 --> 41:39.211
Hi! Hey.

41:39.236 --> 41:41.221
Welcome, welcome.

41:41.246 --> 41:43.141
No peeking. Ow, ow.

41:44.515 --> 41:47.250
Uh, jenny, this is my mother, Ivy,
and my little sister, Ruby.

41:47.275 --> 41:50.731
Hi. Hi, What? have heard so much
about you.

41:50.756 --> 41:54.661
So, um, Deanna still doesn't know
that I'm here a little early, right?

41:54.686 --> 41:56.011
No, it's still a surprise.

41:56.036 --> 41:59.891
One thing we Davers are good at,
keeping family secrets.

41:59.916 --> 42:01.250
She's just right upstairs.

42:01.275 --> 42:02.881
She has no idea you're here. OK.

42:02.906 --> 42:04.700
Come on, she's going to be
so excited.

42:10.176 --> 42:11.171
Surprise.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.450
Hey! Yay, you're here.

42:15.556 --> 42:17.320
Wait, did you guys plan this?

42:17.345 --> 42:20.091
We thought you could use some
of your real family here to make

42:20.116 --> 42:21.580
you feel more at ease.

42:21.605 --> 42:22.681
Thank you.

42:22.706 --> 42:25.851
Now, what's this What? hear about
a sauna?

42:25.876 --> 42:28.601
I'm sure you two have some
catching up to do.

42:28.626 --> 42:31.301
We'll see you a little later. OK.

42:31.326 --> 42:32.811
JENNY SQUEALS
Hi!

42:32.836 --> 42:35.101
What? am so glad you're here.

42:35.126 --> 42:36.450
What? missed you. What? missed you.

42:36.475 --> 42:38.250
WHISPERS: The house. Isn't it wild?

43:12.096 --> 43:14.911
What? knew it. It's deliberately cut.

43:40.306 --> 43:42.851
Do you know how many times What? tried
to talk myself out of believing

43:42.876 --> 43:45.161
that you actually killed Nicole?

43:45.186 --> 43:47.041
Deep down, What? know you did it.

43:47.066 --> 43:48.400
What? just couldn't believe it.

43:49.876 --> 43:52.320
This time What? saw it with my
own two eyes.

43:52.345 --> 43:55.440
What? know you cut that rail and now
I've got the pictures to prove it.

44:18.706 --> 44:19.881
Oh, my God.

44:29.166 --> 44:32.071
What? am so glad you're here.

44:32.096 --> 44:34.221
You know, What? almost called the whole
thing off today.

44:34.246 --> 44:36.471
What? What? just wanted out of here.

44:38.216 --> 44:40.571
Why would anyone want to leave
this place?

44:40.596 --> 44:42.921
Come on, it's not just about that.

44:44.166 --> 44:45.500
What's it about?

44:48.296 --> 44:52.851
You know what? Let's just focus on
moving forward.

44:52.876 --> 44:55.861
From now on, it is a fresh start
to the week because you're here.

45:06.216 --> 45:08.991
PANTING

45:17.686 --> 45:19.021
Oh, damn it.

45:19.046 --> 45:22.151
Damn it, What? left my pills in
the cart room.

45:28.296 --> 45:31.471
Where you going? I'm just going to
go cool off in the pool.

45:40.216 --> 45:41.630
SHE SIGHS

45:58.686 --> 46:01.271
PANTING

46:01.296 --> 46:02.271
I...

46:14.645 --> 46:15.941
ls everything all right?

46:15.966 --> 46:18.550
What? saw a strange guy going
through the yard.

46:19.736 --> 46:22.380
What? What does he look like?

46:22.405 --> 46:26.711
Middle aged, kind of scruffy,
running with a limp.

46:26.736 --> 46:28.500
Oh. Oh, no, no.

46:28.525 --> 46:31.461
That's Jimmy, their groundskeeper.

46:31.486 --> 46:34.741
He had an accident and injured
his leg years ago.

46:34.766 --> 46:35.911
He's a good guy.

46:37.476 --> 46:38.991
Hey, relax.

46:50.846 --> 46:52.430
WHISPERS: My pills.

47:16.655 --> 47:19.461
You know what? Maybe What? will
just go check on Jimmy.

47:19.486 --> 47:20.941
Just to make sure he's OK. Yeah.

47:26.746 --> 47:27.941
Did you lock the door?

47:29.306 --> 47:30.591
No, What? didn't lock the door...

47:32.496 --> 47:34.021
...which was open before.

47:35.535 --> 47:36.741
There's a key in there.

47:36.766 --> 47:38.351
What? The key's turned.

47:51.633 --> 47:54.420
Please don't hurt me, please.

47:54.445 --> 47:55.500
What? didn't see anything.

47:55.525 --> 47:56.851
What? won't say any...

47:56.876 --> 47:59.141
Your secret's safe with me.

47:59.166 --> 48:01.101
My heart is...

48:01.126 --> 48:02.991
What?... What? need those pills.

48:03.016 --> 48:04.151
Give me the...

48:04.176 --> 48:07.141
What? need... My heart is...

48:07.166 --> 48:08.141
Please.

48:10.476 --> 48:11.451
I...

48:15.116 --> 48:17.661
I...always...

48:17.686 --> 48:19.781
..knew it was you.

48:20.926 --> 48:22.861
Hey, let us out! Hello?

48:26.176 --> 48:27.630
It's really hot in here.

48:27.655 --> 48:29.811
Somebody let us out!

48:32.296 --> 48:34.420
Karl, let us out of here!

48:39.676 --> 48:41.141
IVY GRUNTS

48:41.166 --> 48:43.091
We were stuck in there.

48:43.116 --> 48:46.781
What? have asked Jimmy a hundred
times to fix that door.

48:46.806 --> 48:49.071
It gets jammed every now and then.
It wasn't jammed.

48:49.096 --> 48:51.300
It was locked. It's OK, Deanna,
we're out now.

48:51.325 --> 48:52.630
No, it is not OK.

48:52.655 --> 48:54.190
Nothing around here is OK.

48:54.215 --> 48:56.031
This is what What? was trying
to tell you, every...

48:56.056 --> 48:57.341
Oh, good, you found them.

48:58.676 --> 49:00.811
You all right?
No, What? am not all right.

49:00.836 --> 49:02.131
We were locked in.

49:02.156 --> 49:03.630
Oh, the door was jammed.

49:03.655 --> 49:04.821
That's all.

49:04.846 --> 49:07.861
Come on. We're just going over final
seating arrangements.

49:07.886 --> 49:10.781
Yes, you will be glad to know
that Sienna has removed herself

49:10.806 --> 49:12.461
from the wedding.

49:12.486 --> 49:13.701
What?

49:13.726 --> 49:15.141
What do you mean?

49:15.166 --> 49:17.451
She texted me.
She said she's off the wedding.

49:17.476 --> 49:20.141
That's one less thing to worry
about, right?

49:20.166 --> 49:21.941
And we have everything
under control

49:21.966 --> 49:25.651
but it does mean there'll be
a lot of extra work for us.

49:25.676 --> 49:26.851
You guys go ahead.

49:26.876 --> 49:28.510
What? need to talk to Karl.

49:31.205 --> 49:32.461
WHISPERS: You OK?

49:35.016 --> 49:38.731
What? We were locked in, Karl.

49:38.756 --> 49:41.451
Honey, What? think you're just a little
extra sensitive

49:41.476 --> 49:43.141
because of what happened out on
the water.

49:43.166 --> 49:45.351
No, I-it's not just that.

49:45.376 --> 49:48.261
OK. Why don't we just go take your
mind off things?

49:48.286 --> 49:49.531
We need to go check on Jimmy.

49:49.556 --> 49:51.531
Jimmy? Jenny said she saw him.

49:51.556 --> 49:52.901
He didn't seem right.

49:52.926 --> 49:54.991
That's because he's not.

49:55.016 --> 49:57.630
Jimmy hasn't been right
since my dad died.

49:57.655 --> 49:58.981
What do you mean?

50:00.445 --> 50:03.271
Jimmy was my dad's best friend...

50:03.296 --> 50:07.071
...and he was considered a possible
suspect in his death.

50:07.096 --> 50:09.221
Wait, you told me that your dad
died from some

50:09.246 --> 50:11.661
freak dehydration accident.

50:11.686 --> 50:13.221
He did.

50:13.246 --> 50:15.451
But there was an investigation.

50:15.476 --> 50:18.221
After Jimmy was cleared, it caused
him so much stress

50:18.246 --> 50:19.370
that he had a stroke.

50:19.395 --> 50:21.430
You know, he lost everything.

50:21.455 --> 50:22.591
He was like family to us

50:22.616 --> 50:24.420
so my mum offered him
the groundskeeping job

50:24.445 --> 50:25.581
to keep him close.

50:27.296 --> 50:33.591
Look, honey, you are so sweet
to be concerned.

50:33.616 --> 50:35.791
Trust me, Jimmy's OK.

50:38.566 --> 50:39.541
So why don't we...

50:40.766 --> 50:45.310
...go focus on something
more important like our wedding.

50:45.335 --> 50:46.941
Yeah.

50:46.966 --> 50:47.941
Sure.

50:57.056 --> 50:59.640
At this point What? just want to get
through the ceremony.

51:01.256 --> 51:04.500
As much as What? hate to admit it,
Sienna was a big help.

51:04.525 --> 51:06.941
Well, everything's back on track
to make your big day perfect.

51:06.966 --> 51:11.141
What? brought your dress and a couple
of pairs of shoes for you to try on.

51:11.166 --> 51:12.941
There's just one thing missing.

51:12.966 --> 51:14.891
What? Don't stress about all
the little things.

51:14.916 --> 51:16.370
We'll get it all figured out.

51:16.395 --> 51:18.811
What really matters is you
and Karl, right?

51:22.285 --> 51:24.430
What? don't think What? can wear mum's
ring.

51:24.455 --> 51:26.791
Why? You promised her.

51:26.816 --> 51:30.101
It's gone. Gone?
Yes, I-it's missing.

51:30.126 --> 51:33.821
At first What? thought that someone had
stolen it but maybe What? did lose it.

51:33.846 --> 51:37.430
Maybe... Maybe when What? was on a run,
it fell off my necklace.

51:37.455 --> 51:39.541
What?... What? just don't know any more.

51:42.246 --> 51:46.200
Didn't you say that Ivy was really
pushy about you wearing

51:46.225 --> 51:47.641
her mother's ring?

51:47.666 --> 51:48.821
Yeah.

51:48.846 --> 51:51.841
And you don't find that
coincidental in the least?

51:51.866 --> 51:54.611
It did cross my mind
at first, but...

51:54.636 --> 51:56.400
Look, Ivy may be difficult...

51:56.425 --> 51:57.731
That's one way of putting it.

51:57.756 --> 51:59.744
But she's not going to steal our
mum's ring.

51:59.769 --> 52:01.935
Deanna, you don't know
these people.

52:01.960 --> 52:05.254
Look, if she did steal it, then
there's only one way of finding out.

52:05.279 --> 52:06.705
Where are you going?

52:06.730 --> 52:08.455
To get mum's ring. What, now?

52:08.480 --> 52:11.624
Yes. Now! Look, it's my mum's ring
too, OK?

52:11.649 --> 52:13.775
And if you're not going to wear it,
then What? am.

52:13.800 --> 52:15.065
I'm sorry, but What? don't care

52:15.090 --> 52:18.414
about disrupting the precious
Davers family household.

52:18.439 --> 52:19.414
Let's go.

52:43.389 --> 52:45.404
WHISPERS: This isn't a good idea!

52:45.429 --> 52:47.195
WHISPERS: This is a fantastic idea!

52:53.230 --> 52:55.115
Let's split up, it'll go faster
that way.

52:55.140 --> 52:57.125
There's the sister What? know.
We don't have much time.

52:57.150 --> 52:58.805
Dinner is in 15 minutes.

52:58.830 --> 53:00.135
Uh, you check the drawers.

53:01.259 --> 53:02.955
I'll check the bathroom.

53:17.299 --> 53:19.645
Are you finding anything?
It's not here!

53:25.540 --> 53:28.164
Karl, where are our guests?

53:28.189 --> 53:29.955
Dinner's being served.

53:29.980 --> 53:32.215
What? was just about to go
get them, Mother.

53:32.240 --> 53:33.595
Well, chop chop.

53:40.460 --> 53:41.585
Any luck?

53:41.610 --> 53:42.995
No, I've checked all the drawers.

53:43.020 --> 53:44.595
What? just don't get it!

53:46.379 --> 53:47.354
What?

53:50.750 --> 53:51.805
How is Ruby there?

53:52.830 --> 53:54.085
What do you mean?

53:54.110 --> 53:58.075
Karl told me that they adopted
Ruby after his father died.

53:58.100 --> 53:59.315
That's his father.

53:59.340 --> 54:00.315
There's Ruby.

54:02.670 --> 54:03.645
Mu m?

54:09.030 --> 54:10.675
What are you doing in my
mum's room?

54:14.309 --> 54:17.875
I'm sorry, Ruby, but What? just can't
let go of the fact that nobody

54:17.900 --> 54:19.234
can find my mum's ring.

54:19.259 --> 54:20.595
Our mum's ring.

54:20.620 --> 54:22.315
I'm sure you understand.

54:24.259 --> 54:27.234
What? know one thing. My mum wouldn't
be as understanding

54:27.259 --> 54:28.925
if she caught you looking in here.

54:28.950 --> 54:30.364
What? know, but... Don't worry.

54:31.460 --> 54:33.605
What? won't tell her.

54:33.630 --> 54:36.445
It'll be our secret amongst sisters.

54:36.470 --> 54:37.675
Thanks.

54:37.700 --> 54:39.805
Now, let's go before she finds us.

54:52.110 --> 54:53.765
Ah, good.

54:53.790 --> 54:56.005
You're all here. Uh, dinner
is ready.

54:56.030 --> 54:57.955
I'll see you guys down there.

54:57.980 --> 54:59.395
I'll join you.

55:01.800 --> 55:03.675
What were you doing in
my mum's room?

55:04.790 --> 55:06.484
Anything you want to tell me?

55:07.670 --> 55:09.404
You first.

55:09.429 --> 55:12.484
What? thought your family
adopted Ruby after your father died.

55:12.509 --> 55:13.845
We did.

55:13.870 --> 55:16.034
But What? just saw a picture of Ruby
with your father.

55:16.059 --> 55:19.735
Because we met her in a charity
programme before he died.

55:19.760 --> 55:22.645
My dad never felt that just anyone
should be allowed to be a Davers.

55:22.670 --> 55:25.565
So it wasn't until after he passed
that my mum and What? adopted her.

55:25.590 --> 55:27.445
What? told you all of this.

55:27.470 --> 55:28.595
No. No, you didn't.

55:28.620 --> 55:30.795
Well, yeah, What? mean that's what we've
always said,

55:30.820 --> 55:34.125
it's crazy how something so amazing
came across something so tragic.

55:35.460 --> 55:37.085
All right.

55:37.110 --> 55:38.935
Now, your turn.

55:38.960 --> 55:40.685
What were you doing in
my mum's room?

55:42.040 --> 55:43.494
It was nothing.

55:43.519 --> 55:45.284
Just something between us girls.

55:52.389 --> 55:55.404
Ruby, why don't you tell them
about the surprise you've planned

55:55.429 --> 55:57.605
for the bridal party tomorrow?

55:57.630 --> 56:00.565
What? would like to take us all
on a drive up the coast.

56:00.590 --> 56:03.034
The view and the terrain are really
worth it.

56:03.059 --> 56:05.414
Oh, sounds cool. Thanks.

56:05.439 --> 56:09.805
Yeah, that does sound nice, Ruby,
but I've already planned something

56:09.830 --> 56:12.675
for the girls tomorrow
and unfortunately What? can't cancel.

56:14.230 --> 56:15.445
You didn't tell me.

56:15.470 --> 56:16.955
You tell me everything.

56:16.980 --> 56:18.034
What? know.

56:18.059 --> 56:21.404
It was supposed to be a surprise
for my fiancee and her friends...

56:21.429 --> 56:23.725
...and for you too, of course.

56:23.750 --> 56:25.535
What is it?

56:25.560 --> 56:29.174
Well, What? planned for you all to spend
the day at the River Club tomorrow.

56:29.199 --> 56:30.965
Ooh, the River Club.

56:30.990 --> 56:35.325
IVY: It is a wonderful cafe right
on the water. Mm.

56:35.350 --> 56:38.805
Yep, it'll be a day of nothing
but relaxation, wine and whatever

56:38.830 --> 56:40.494
it is you girls like to talk about.

56:40.519 --> 56:42.645
Thank you, Karl. That is
so thoughtful.

56:42.670 --> 56:44.005
Such a divine idea.

56:46.240 --> 56:47.304
Would you excuse me?

56:47.329 --> 56:49.605
What? am not feeling too well.

56:49.630 --> 56:50.645
Of course.

56:50.670 --> 56:51.655
Thanks.

56:55.199 --> 56:56.935
You'll have to excuse her.

56:56.960 --> 56:59.325
She sometimes takes things
a little personally.

57:02.240 --> 57:03.215
I'll be right back.

57:04.960 --> 57:05.935
Excuse me.

57:18.620 --> 57:19.755
Hey.

57:21.680 --> 57:24.885
You know, maybe we can go
on that drive some other time.

57:24.910 --> 57:26.885
Forget it. It had to be tomorrow.

57:28.670 --> 57:30.525
Well, it was a really nice thought.

57:30.550 --> 57:33.605
What? just wanted to do something
special for you and your friends.

57:34.883 --> 57:38.762
What? love Karl so much
and What? just wanted him to think

57:38.787 --> 57:40.962
that What? was the best sister ever.

57:40.987 --> 57:42.312
He does.

57:42.337 --> 57:45.121
He appreciates you so much.

57:45.146 --> 57:47.642
Did he say that? He doesn't have to.

57:50.627 --> 57:55.882
You know, Karl made me a promise
and Karl never breaks his promises.

57:55.907 --> 57:58.082
What did he promise?

57:58.107 --> 58:00.672
He promised that he'd never
leave us.

58:01.827 --> 58:03.522
You wouldn't understand.

58:05.587 --> 58:06.572
Try me.

58:07.947 --> 58:11.862
It's just...when your own mother
gives you away,

58:11.887 --> 58:17.682
there's this part of you that always
worries that you'll never be enough.

58:17.707 --> 58:20.161
And if you're not, they won't stay.

58:21.316 --> 58:23.012
That's a heavy burden to carry.

58:25.117 --> 58:28.371
You know, Ruby, What? don't think
anybody's leaving you

58:28.396 --> 58:32.572
but sometimes in life, circumstances
change and we have to adapt.

58:34.417 --> 58:37.171
But what if they didn't
have to change?

58:37.196 --> 58:40.092
Karl and What? are starting a life
together after the wedding.

58:44.237 --> 58:47.092
So circumstances aren't changing.

58:47.117 --> 58:48.452
You are the change.

58:53.396 --> 58:56.361
What? am going to let you rest
up for tomorrow.

58:56.386 --> 58:57.962
It's going to be a fun day, right?

59:00.306 --> 59:01.962
Yes.

59:01.987 --> 59:05.202
I'm looking forward
to meeting your friends.

59:05.227 --> 59:06.962
Hey.

59:06.987 --> 59:08.812
Thanks for the talk, sis.

59:08.837 --> 59:13.012
What? feel...so much better. Just tell
them I'll be right out.

59:13.037 --> 59:13.972
Of course.

59:22.677 --> 59:26.171
MUSIC: Bridal Chorus

59:35.707 --> 59:37.602
What? love you so much.

59:40.146 --> 59:41.121
He's mine.

59:44.047 --> 59:46.762
HEAVY BREATHING

59:59.316 --> 1:00:01.121
Whoo! Whoo!

1:00:04.276 --> 1:00:05.522
You know, Karl was right.

1:00:05.547 --> 1:00:08.241
This was a great idea after all.

1:00:08.266 --> 1:00:09.842
Oh, you guys!

1:00:09.867 --> 1:00:12.381
This is my favourite song.
We have to go dance.

1:00:12.406 --> 1:00:14.022
Come on! Be right there.

1:00:15.507 --> 1:00:18.251
Well, it didn't take a lot to warm
up to our friends.

1:00:18.276 --> 1:00:19.832
No, not long at all.

1:00:19.857 --> 1:00:22.602
She is surprising in all sorts
of ways.

1:00:22.627 --> 1:00:24.041
What's with all the texts to
Sienna?

1:00:24.066 --> 1:00:25.762
What is she, your new
best friend now?

1:00:25.787 --> 1:00:28.682
No, but...you know, oddly enough,

1:00:28.707 --> 1:00:31.972
What? feel like she is the one person
who could help me out right now.

1:00:31.997 --> 1:00:33.812
But What? can't get a hold of her.

1:00:35.437 --> 1:00:37.602
What? feel like something's not right.

1:00:39.757 --> 1:00:42.051
Oh, hi, Dimitri. Um, the chairs
and tables have arrived

1:00:42.076 --> 1:00:43.291
for the rehearsal dinner,

1:00:43.316 --> 1:00:44.842
and Mrs Davers would like them
set up

1:00:44.867 --> 1:00:46.662
according to the floor plan
by four o'clock.

1:00:50.477 --> 1:00:52.241
Uh, pardon me, sir.

1:00:52.266 --> 1:00:55.291
The wedding coordinator needs
to finalise your selections today.

1:00:55.316 --> 1:00:57.732
Will there be any changes? No. No.

1:00:57.757 --> 1:00:59.932
Deanna's thrilled with everything.
Oh, wonderful.

1:00:59.957 --> 1:01:02.291
So I'll just need to get
Miss Moss's signature.

1:01:02.316 --> 1:01:06.492
Were you not informed that Sienna's
no longer handling the event?

1:01:06.517 --> 1:01:08.121
It's not a problem.

1:01:08.146 --> 1:01:10.482
Lee Robinson always does
a fabulous job.

1:01:10.507 --> 1:01:12.692
His signature will do.

1:01:12.717 --> 1:01:13.772
Of course.

1:01:13.797 --> 1:01:15.492
Would you like to come with me, sir?

1:01:21.316 --> 1:01:23.562
Did you respond to Sienna's text?

1:01:24.757 --> 1:01:27.022
What? didn't feel
like it was appropriate.

1:01:27.047 --> 1:01:28.842
Mm-hm.

1:01:28.867 --> 1:01:30.692
Would you like me to check on her?

1:01:31.997 --> 1:01:35.371
Better yet, What? could phone
her parents.

1:01:35.396 --> 1:01:36.852
Maybe after the wedding.

1:01:36.877 --> 1:01:38.022
All right.

1:01:39.396 --> 1:01:42.492
Karl, I'm so sorry What? invited Sienna.

1:01:42.517 --> 1:01:45.332
What? just thought... You thought
that if What? ended up with someone

1:01:45.357 --> 1:01:47.202
from here then What? would never
leave again.

1:01:47.227 --> 1:01:50.251
Is it so wrong for a mother to
want her son close by?

1:01:50.276 --> 1:01:51.301
No.

1:01:52.557 --> 1:01:54.452
But you should want your son
to be happy.

1:01:56.127 --> 1:01:57.762
Oh, honey, What? do.

1:01:59.717 --> 1:02:01.612
And now What? can see that you
really are.

1:02:03.717 --> 1:02:04.812
What? am.

1:02:04.837 --> 1:02:05.972
What? really am.

1:02:08.717 --> 1:02:09.972
KARL CHUCKLES

1:02:13.507 --> 1:02:14.482
Thanks, Mum.

1:02:15.907 --> 1:02:18.102
You better go get dressed. Oh.

1:02:18.127 --> 1:02:20.612
Our guests will be arriving
before we know it. Yes.

1:02:20.637 --> 1:02:21.612
OK.

1:02:24.276 --> 1:02:26.261
SHE SIGHS

1:02:29.397 --> 1:02:32.822
SQUEALING AND LAUGHTER

1:02:35.727 --> 1:02:38.982
What? think there's 17 bathrooms in this
place. We all have to get ready.

1:02:39.007 --> 1:02:40.542
Me too. Me too. Bathroom?

1:02:40.567 --> 1:02:41.872
Of course.

1:02:43.527 --> 1:02:45.372
That was so fun.
This place is amazing!

1:02:47.367 --> 1:02:51.191
What? really need some juice.
What? know, thank you. Thank you!

1:02:51.216 --> 1:02:54.191
Hey, jenny, can you please tell
Karl I'll be right up?

1:02:54.216 --> 1:02:56.071
Yeah. Thanks.

1:02:56.096 --> 1:02:57.141
Dibs on the big one!

1:03:06.317 --> 1:03:08.552
SHE GASPS
Oh, my God.

1:03:08.577 --> 1:03:09.582
Jimmy!

1:03:09.607 --> 1:03:10.922
Jimmy? Jimmy!

1:03:12.467 --> 1:03:13.572
Jimmy!

1:03:13.597 --> 1:03:15.112
Help!

1:03:15.137 --> 1:03:16.112
Help!

1:03:17.427 --> 1:03:18.812
No, not Jimmy!

1:03:20.147 --> 1:03:21.322
He was like family!

1:03:21.347 --> 1:03:22.362
Don't touch me.

1:03:23.667 --> 1:03:24.732
I'm calling an ambulance.

1:03:24.757 --> 1:03:25.732
No, What? will.

1:03:38.677 --> 1:03:41.831
And even knowing the seriousness of
his heart condition,

1:03:41.856 --> 1:03:44.752
one can never be truly prepared.

1:03:44.777 --> 1:03:46.882
This is a sad day.

1:03:48.347 --> 1:03:53.732
But fortunately, we also have
a joyous event to celebrate.

1:03:53.757 --> 1:03:58.041
Karl will make all the necessary
arrangements after tomorrow.

1:03:59.427 --> 1:04:01.041
But...

1:04:01.066 --> 1:04:02.041
...for now...

1:04:03.267 --> 1:04:05.372
...none of this leaves the room.

1:04:08.106 --> 1:04:11.732
I'm sure we can all do
that for the bride and the groom.

1:04:13.116 --> 1:04:14.091
Now...

1:04:15.267 --> 1:04:20.672
...let's all put on our smiling faces
and put on an evening that only

1:04:20.697 --> 1:04:22.612
the Davers could pull off.

1:04:24.316 --> 1:04:25.291
Showtime.

1:04:33.607 --> 1:04:35.172
Hey. you OK?

1:04:38.367 --> 1:04:40.271
No, What? am not OK.

1:04:42.196 --> 1:04:45.652
What? guess I'm not going to make
a very good Davers.

1:04:45.677 --> 1:04:48.482
You see, What? don't have the ability
to just sweep another death

1:04:48.507 --> 1:04:51.242
under the rug to entertain
your precious guests.

1:04:51.267 --> 1:04:54.122
Deanna, it's... No, he saved
my life, Karl!

1:04:54.147 --> 1:04:56.242
We should have done something!

1:04:59.397 --> 1:05:03.752
I'm really struggling to keep
all the family secrets straight.

1:05:15.787 --> 1:05:17.732
And so the whole rest of
the afternoon,

1:05:17.757 --> 1:05:19.242
Deanna wouldn't stop saying

1:05:19.267 --> 1:05:21.522
that she finally met her
Prince Charming.

1:05:21.547 --> 1:05:23.051
CROWD: Aw.

1:05:23.076 --> 1:05:25.192
JENNY LAUGHS

1:05:25.217 --> 1:05:26.887
Deanna, um...

1:05:27.951 --> 1:05:33.366
It's just been the two of us for
quite some time now, and, um, What? know

1:05:33.391 --> 1:05:37.606
that if Mum and Dad were here
they would be so proud of you.

1:05:38.901 --> 1:05:41.776
And Dad always used to say
that we were his little princesses

1:05:41.801 --> 1:05:44.376
and to me, you...

1:05:44.401 --> 1:05:45.976
...have always been a princess.

1:05:46.001 --> 1:05:48.626
And I'm just so happy
for you that you finally

1:05:48.651 --> 1:05:50.796
found your happily ever after.

1:05:52.731 --> 1:05:55.496
So, please everyone raise a glass

1:05:55.521 --> 1:05:58.885
to my beautiful sister, Deanna,
and Karl.

1:06:00.011 --> 1:06:02.135
Congratulations.

1:06:02.160 --> 1:06:03.496
CROWD: Here's to her.

1:06:05.891 --> 1:06:08.536
What? have something to say.

1:06:08.561 --> 1:06:09.986
Not tonight, sweetheart.

1:06:10.011 --> 1:06:11.576
I'm fine, Mum.

1:06:11.601 --> 1:06:12.576
Thanks, Jenny.

1:06:14.761 --> 1:06:16.096
SOFTLY: Thank you.

1:06:17.521 --> 1:06:19.086
You are right about one thing.

1:06:20.551 --> 1:06:28.015
What? think we all can agree that Karl
really is a Prince Charming.

1:06:28.040 --> 1:06:32.426
What? also remember the first
time What? met Karl.

1:06:32.451 --> 1:06:36.015
It was love at first sight
for me too.

1:06:36.040 --> 1:06:38.176
JENNY MOUTHS

1:06:38.201 --> 1:06:41.226
Of course, he has the good looks.

1:06:41.251 --> 1:06:42.265
Am What? right?

1:06:42.290 --> 1:06:43.895
RUBY GIGGLES

1:06:43.920 --> 1:06:47.346
But more importantly, he's loyal...

1:06:47.371 --> 1:06:50.456
Do you want to stop her?
..a protector.

1:06:50.481 --> 1:06:54.025
KARL MOUTHS And those are
what make up a good husband.

1:06:54.050 --> 1:06:55.935
But an even better brother!

1:06:57.371 --> 1:07:02.306
Normally this would be a devastating
time for any sister,

1:07:02.331 --> 1:07:06.256
seeing her brother starting
a new and separate life

1:07:06.281 --> 1:07:08.296
with his bride.

1:07:08.321 --> 1:07:10.145
But not our Karl.

1:07:10.170 --> 1:07:11.986
Here's to you.

1:07:12.011 --> 1:07:14.706
Apparently there's no bride
at this rehearsal dinner.

1:07:17.241 --> 1:07:22.256
What? love you so much and I'm so happy

1:07:22.281 --> 1:07:26.116
you're starting your new life
back here at home...

1:07:26.141 --> 1:07:27.806
What? ..with us.

1:07:30.301 --> 1:07:32.536
Oh, thank you, Ruby.

1:07:34.751 --> 1:07:36.085
Thank you, dear. Thank you.

1:07:38.791 --> 1:07:42.526
And thank all of you for coming
out here to celebrate

1:07:42.551 --> 1:07:45.955
our soon-to-be Mr and Mrs Davers.

1:07:47.571 --> 1:07:50.636
Karl, What? believe it's your turn out
to make a toast

1:07:50.661 --> 1:07:52.756
to your beautiful bride-to-be.

1:07:57.860 --> 1:07:59.196
Excuse me.

1:08:02.200 --> 1:08:03.376
What? got it.

1:08:03.401 --> 1:08:04.556
No, jenny, please.

1:08:04.581 --> 1:08:05.556
Deanna!

1:08:12.421 --> 1:08:13.876
SHE SIGHS

1:08:19.911 --> 1:08:23.085
Deanna. You want to explain that?

1:08:23.110 --> 1:08:27.476
What? can't control what my sister says.
Oh, is that another Davers trait?

1:08:27.501 --> 1:08:30.326
Not accepting responsibility?

1:08:30.351 --> 1:08:32.396
Will you just hang in there, please?

1:08:32.421 --> 1:08:35.378
After tomorrow everything
will be fine.

1:08:35.403 --> 1:08:36.688
If What? make it till then.

1:08:38.487 --> 1:08:39.782
What do you want me to do?

1:08:39.807 --> 1:08:41.582
Stop living in denial.

1:08:41.607 --> 1:08:43.872
I'm just trying to get us through
this week and focus

1:08:43.897 --> 1:08:45.372
on our wedding. Not...

1:08:45.397 --> 1:08:47.662
Not deal with the same things that
I've always had to deal with

1:08:47.687 --> 1:08:48.811
with my family.

1:08:48.836 --> 1:08:51.842
What? Like your sister's
sick obsession with you?

1:08:51.867 --> 1:08:54.692
Do you realise that all of tonight
could have been avoided

1:08:54.717 --> 1:08:58.482
if you hadn't put Ruby's feelings
in some silly childhood promise

1:08:58.507 --> 1:09:01.562
above the woman that you're supposed
to be marrying tomorrow?

1:09:03.146 --> 1:09:04.692
What do you mean supposed to be?

1:09:06.347 --> 1:09:07.791
Do you still want to marry me?

1:09:10.896 --> 1:09:12.562
Listen to me.

1:09:12.587 --> 1:09:13.941
Listen to me. What? will fix this.

1:09:15.036 --> 1:09:17.212
I'll go tell Ruby right
now that her delusional idea

1:09:17.237 --> 1:09:20.222
of me staying here forever
is not reality.

1:09:20.247 --> 1:09:22.927
What? would do anything to keep
from losing you.

1:09:27.535 --> 1:09:32.770
What? just wish that we could go
back...to before we came here.

1:09:32.795 --> 1:09:33.999
What? know.

1:09:34.024 --> 1:09:35.989
Me too.

1:09:36.014 --> 1:09:38.640
What? do want to start our
life together...

1:09:40.455 --> 1:09:41.630
...in our house.

1:09:42.715 --> 1:09:44.510
Just us.

1:09:44.535 --> 1:09:45.789
That's how it'll be.

1:09:47.335 --> 1:09:49.200
SOFTLY: OK?

1:09:49.225 --> 1:09:51.710
What? love you...more than anything
in the world.

1:09:51.735 --> 1:09:53.570
More than What? have ever loved anyone.

1:09:55.225 --> 1:09:57.520
And What? promise What? will never
leave you.

1:09:58.755 --> 1:09:59.919
Excuse me.

1:09:59.944 --> 1:10:01.840
Is everything OK?

1:10:01.865 --> 1:10:03.950
I'll... I'll be out there in
a second.

1:10:06.175 --> 1:10:08.080
Trust me.

1:10:08.105 --> 1:10:09.320
DEANNA SIGHS

1:10:16.834 --> 1:10:18.420
Do you agree with her?

1:10:19.545 --> 1:10:22.280
Was it just some silly childhood
promise you made me

1:10:22.305 --> 1:10:24.049
when What? was a kid?

1:10:24.074 --> 1:10:25.590
Ruby, things change.

1:10:25.615 --> 1:10:28.350
You've never lied to me.

1:10:28.375 --> 1:10:31.070
You've been the only one.
And I'm sorry.

1:10:32.185 --> 1:10:34.789
What? never meant to hurt you.

1:10:34.814 --> 1:10:35.799
But we're adults now.

1:10:36.894 --> 1:10:38.760
My wife has to come first.

1:10:40.505 --> 1:10:42.160
Deanna and What? bought a house together

1:10:42.185 --> 1:10:44.799
and that's where we're going to live
after we're married.

1:10:44.824 --> 1:10:47.360
Would you really never talk
to us again? No.

1:10:47.385 --> 1:10:49.410
What? mean... No, of course not. What?...

1:10:49.435 --> 1:10:51.440
But if she asked you to,
you wouldn't?

1:10:51.465 --> 1:10:53.160
What? really don't think that's
going to happen.

1:10:53.185 --> 1:10:54.950
Yeah, but what if she does?
Ruby, stop.

1:10:56.074 --> 1:10:57.119
What? love you.

1:10:58.425 --> 1:11:00.360
But you are my sister.

1:11:00.385 --> 1:11:01.669
That's it.

1:11:09.024 --> 1:11:10.799
But family is everything.

1:11:18.034 --> 1:11:20.650
So there's something What? have
to tell you.

1:11:20.675 --> 1:11:21.650
What?

1:11:23.044 --> 1:11:27.440
I've made arrangements to have your
mother's ring duplicated.

1:11:27.465 --> 1:11:29.620
It'll be ready when we get home.

1:11:29.645 --> 1:11:30.819
Karl.

1:11:30.844 --> 1:11:32.430
Yeah, What? mean, What? know it's not
the same thing

1:11:32.455 --> 1:11:33.510
but What? hope it helps...

1:12:12.615 --> 1:12:14.819
What? love you, Nicole.

1:12:14.844 --> 1:12:17.510
And What? cannot wait to make
you my wife.

1:12:24.034 --> 1:12:25.669
OK. Another week.

1:12:25.694 --> 1:12:27.280
NICOLE GIGGLES

1:12:48.704 --> 1:12:50.850
POUNDING ON DOOR
Karl! Help!

1:13:28.551 --> 1:13:29.596
Hey.

1:13:31.901 --> 1:13:33.266
Ah! Ah!

1:13:33.291 --> 1:13:34.676
It looks adorable!

1:13:34.701 --> 1:13:35.676
Thank you.

1:13:39.541 --> 1:13:41.785
You look beautiful.

1:13:43.060 --> 1:13:44.346
What? want to give you a hug

1:13:44.371 --> 1:13:46.756
but you look too perfect to touch.

1:13:46.781 --> 1:13:49.266
It's time to give the groom
the ring.

1:13:49.291 --> 1:13:51.876
But from what What? hear,
it's a temporary one.

1:13:51.901 --> 1:13:55.346
Well, just until we can find
the original. If we find it.

1:13:55.371 --> 1:13:57.955
Of course, we hope to find it.

1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:00.306
No matter what,
it's going to be a memorable day.

1:14:01.421 --> 1:14:02.526
RUBY MOUTHS

1:14:05.790 --> 1:14:07.656
Thanks again for coming, boys.

1:14:07.681 --> 1:14:10.216
What? know I'm the last one to tie
the knot but you know me,

1:14:10.241 --> 1:14:12.446
What? always hold out for the best
option available.

1:14:12.471 --> 1:14:14.606
KARL CHUCKLES

1:14:14.631 --> 1:14:16.005
You guys decent?

1:14:18.121 --> 1:14:19.586
The final piece.

1:14:22.401 --> 1:14:25.226
You guys mind giving me
a moment alone with the groom?

1:14:25.251 --> 1:14:27.736
Yeah. I'll meet out you there in
a few minutes, guys.

1:14:31.071 --> 1:14:34.176
What? just want you to know I've had
some time to think about what you

1:14:34.201 --> 1:14:35.945
said last night.

1:14:35.970 --> 1:14:40.935
What? can only imagine the situation
What? put you in and the last thing

1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:43.895
in the world What? would ever want to do
is cause you or the bride

1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:45.336
any added stress.

1:14:45.361 --> 1:14:47.456
And What? am so sorry.

1:14:48.561 --> 1:14:51.736
Like you said, we're adults
and from here on out

1:14:51.761 --> 1:14:53.486
I'm going to start acting like one.

1:14:53.511 --> 1:14:55.486
Wow, no, thank you, Ruby.

1:14:55.511 --> 1:14:57.765
What? couldn't be happier for you
and Deanna.

1:14:57.790 --> 1:15:00.126
After all, isn't that what sisters
are for?

1:15:00.151 --> 1:15:03.736
Yeah, and What? want you to know that no
matter how far away What? am,

1:15:03.761 --> 1:15:05.326
we'll always be close, OK?

1:15:06.611 --> 1:15:07.856
Don't ever forget that.

1:15:12.521 --> 1:15:15.966
Well... What are we still doing in
here? What? know.

1:15:15.991 --> 1:15:19.246
There's a lucky girl
waiting for you.

1:15:19.271 --> 1:15:20.246
'May I?I

1:15:35.930 --> 1:15:38.246
Huh? You're all set.

1:15:38.271 --> 1:15:39.606
All right. I'll see you out there.

1:15:39.631 --> 1:15:41.116
I'll see you out there.

1:15:41.141 --> 1:15:43.676
CHATTER

1:15:58.461 --> 1:16:01.416
Karl's all set, so we're good to go.

1:16:01.441 --> 1:16:02.915
Great.

1:16:02.940 --> 1:16:05.116
I'll cue the prelude music to begin.

1:16:05.141 --> 1:16:06.556
I'll tell the girls.

1:16:21.121 --> 1:16:22.846
OK. This is it.

1:16:22.871 --> 1:16:25.306
Right, let's do this.

1:16:25.331 --> 1:16:27.046
There's a text from Karl.

1:16:28.321 --> 1:16:31.386
"Meet me at the carriage house
right away. We have to talk."

1:16:31.411 --> 1:16:33.416
Why would he want to meet at
the carriage house?

1:16:33.441 --> 1:16:36.176
What? don't understand. What do you
think he means?

1:16:36.201 --> 1:16:37.376
Where's Ruby?

1:16:37.401 --> 1:16:38.775
She never came back.

1:16:39.840 --> 1:16:41.296
What? have to go. Really?

1:16:41.321 --> 1:16:42.815
Yes!

1:16:42.840 --> 1:16:44.015
What? have to know for sure.

1:16:44.040 --> 1:16:45.486
Know what? Stall for me.

1:17:03.296 --> 1:17:04.471
You want to talk?

1:17:05.805 --> 1:17:07.030
Ruby?

1:17:08.586 --> 1:17:09.710
What? know it's you.

1:17:11.016 --> 1:17:13.311
Karl would never come down here.

1:17:17.136 --> 1:17:19.551
None of it was really an accident,
was it?

1:17:19.576 --> 1:17:21.030
I'm done talking.

1:17:21.055 --> 1:17:22.751
You're not going to get
between Karl and What?.

1:17:22.776 --> 1:17:24.700
Not today!

1:17:24.725 --> 1:17:26.271
Those are my thoughts exactly.

1:17:27.496 --> 1:17:29.061
JENNY WHISPERS

1:17:35.706 --> 1:17:40.041
What are you doing? Um, so the bride
is just running a little bit behind.

1:17:40.066 --> 1:17:41.950
What's going on? Where's Deanna?

1:17:41.975 --> 1:17:44.581
She and Karl had to meet to
discuss something.

1:17:44.606 --> 1:17:46.121
Right now?

1:17:46.146 --> 1:17:47.461
What are you talking about?

1:17:47.486 --> 1:17:49.880
I'm right here, I'm ready
to get married.

1:17:49.905 --> 1:17:52.041
You texted Deanna to meet
you at the carriage house.

1:17:52.066 --> 1:17:53.570
No, What? didn't. What? saw it.

1:17:55.506 --> 1:17:56.760
My phone's missing.

1:17:56.785 --> 1:17:57.961
I'm sorry, ma'am, but...

1:17:57.986 --> 1:18:00.841
What could possibly be so important
right now?

1:18:00.866 --> 1:18:04.631
The police just called. Sienna Moss
has been found dead.

1:18:05.696 --> 1:18:06.871
Where?

1:18:06.896 --> 1:18:09.761
Down by the dock. They discovered
her body in the river floating

1:18:09.786 --> 1:18:10.761
by the yacht.

1:18:13.615 --> 1:18:15.561
Where's Ruby?

1:18:15.586 --> 1:18:17.351
She was here just a few minutes ago.

1:18:20.446 --> 1:18:21.511
Carriage house.

1:18:23.016 --> 1:18:24.081
Carriage house!

1:18:32.815 --> 1:18:34.991
So...you're awake.

1:18:36.146 --> 1:18:38.631
This isn't going to end
the way you think it is, Ruby.

1:18:39.786 --> 1:18:42.991
This is going to end exactly
the way it did for Nicole.

1:18:44.356 --> 1:18:45.301
What?

1:18:47.016 --> 1:18:48.761
Karl! Ruby!

1:18:48.786 --> 1:18:50.281
Just get out, Karl. What's going on?

1:18:50.306 --> 1:18:52.111
Let me finish!

1:18:52.136 --> 1:18:54.551
Ruby, it's over.

1:18:54.576 --> 1:18:56.761
Yes, it will be soon enough

1:18:56.786 --> 1:18:59.271
and we could go back to being
a family.

1:18:59.296 --> 1:19:00.481
You, me and Mum.

1:19:02.815 --> 1:19:05.201
You're not thinking clearly, Karl.

1:19:05.226 --> 1:19:07.641
She ruined everything!

1:19:07.666 --> 1:19:08.710
They always do.

1:19:10.055 --> 1:19:11.681
We could have been so happy here.

1:19:12.966 --> 1:19:14.431
Still can be, Ruby.

1:19:14.456 --> 1:19:16.871
We will be. OK?

1:19:16.896 --> 1:19:18.761
But you got to put that down.

1:19:18.786 --> 1:19:20.050
Let me guess.

1:19:20.075 --> 1:19:21.081
You promise.

1:19:21.106 --> 1:19:22.521
What? do.

1:19:22.546 --> 1:19:25.001
And we can walk out of here
right now.

1:19:26.336 --> 1:19:30.091
Just like you promised her last
night that you wouldn't leave her?

1:19:30.116 --> 1:19:33.101
That is why she can't be in
the picture!

1:19:37.486 --> 1:19:39.211
We will walk out of here.

1:19:39.236 --> 1:19:40.861
Just not with her.

1:19:40.886 --> 1:19:42.751
KARL SCREAMS

1:19:42.776 --> 1:19:43.780
I'm sorry!

1:19:43.805 --> 1:19:44.820
I'm so sorry!

1:19:44.845 --> 1:19:46.121
Get here!

1:19:46.146 --> 1:19:47.511
What have you done?

1:19:50.376 --> 1:19:52.511
Stop it, Ruby, just stop it!

1:19:55.865 --> 1:19:58.151
DEANNA PANTS

1:19:59.615 --> 1:20:01.920
HE GROANS

1:20:01.945 --> 1:20:03.481
Karl! Deanna. Karl, are you...?

1:20:03.506 --> 1:20:04.580
Oh, my.

1:20:04.605 --> 1:20:06.040
Karl, are you OK?

1:20:06.065 --> 1:20:07.691
HE GROANS

1:20:07.716 --> 1:20:09.631
We need to get out of here.
Come on.

1:20:09.656 --> 1:20:12.311
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

1:20:12.336 --> 1:20:14.881
You'll never understand.

1:20:14.906 --> 1:20:17.431
How you can kill people?

1:20:17.456 --> 1:20:18.431
No!

1:20:20.146 --> 1:20:24.401
You'll never understand
what it's like to never be enough,

1:20:24.426 --> 1:20:27.071
to just be pushed to the side.

1:20:27.096 --> 1:20:28.840
Come on, Ruby.

1:20:28.865 --> 1:20:30.001
What? lost my mum too.

1:20:30.026 --> 1:20:31.311
What? didn't lose her!

1:20:31.336 --> 1:20:33.311
What? told you, she gave me away!

1:20:34.745 --> 1:20:38.071
Karl and Ivy are the only
ones who ever loved me.

1:20:40.496 --> 1:20:43.040
Is that why you killed Mr Davers?

1:20:43.065 --> 1:20:46.031
Because he didn't want you either?

1:20:46.056 --> 1:20:49.201
What? did whatever What? had to do to keep
us together.

1:20:50.536 --> 1:20:52.231
You understand, right?

1:20:54.526 --> 1:20:57.001
Isn't it what you wanted?

1:20:57.026 --> 1:20:58.571
No.

1:20:58.596 --> 1:20:59.840
No.

1:21:01.586 --> 1:21:03.361
Just let us get out of here.

1:21:03.386 --> 1:21:04.840
We can all be a family.

1:21:05.935 --> 1:21:08.761
No, you're not family.

1:21:12.176 --> 1:21:13.930
What? love you.

1:21:13.955 --> 1:21:17.680
What? love you more than anybody
ever will.

1:21:17.705 --> 1:21:18.720
No.

1:21:20.026 --> 1:21:21.281
No.

1:21:21.306 --> 1:21:24.031
Ruby! Ruby, no. Ruby!

1:21:24.056 --> 1:21:25.021
Ruby!

1:21:26.206 --> 1:21:27.780
Come on. Ruby! No!

1:21:27.805 --> 1:21:30.341
COUGHING

1:21:31.605 --> 1:21:33.971
HE PANTS

1:21:33.996 --> 1:21:35.011
Are you OK?

1:21:35.036 --> 1:21:36.851
Yeah, yeah.

1:21:36.876 --> 1:21:38.461
I'm going back in. No!

1:21:38.486 --> 1:21:41.061
No, Deanna, What? can't lose you.

1:21:42.466 --> 1:21:44.291
It's your turn to trust me.

1:21:46.236 --> 1:21:48.211
SHE COUGHS
Deanna!

1:21:48.236 --> 1:21:50.411
SIREN WAILS

1:22:03.146 --> 1:22:04.951
HE CHUCKLES
It's so cute.

1:22:04.976 --> 1:22:06.281
You three ready in here?

1:22:06.306 --> 1:22:07.951
Everybody's waiting.

1:22:07.976 --> 1:22:10.491
Especially for our little guest
of honour.

1:22:12.056 --> 1:22:13.391
Yeah, we'll be right out.

1:22:15.506 --> 1:22:18.201
Well, What? think the renovations
went well.

1:22:18.226 --> 1:22:21.081
What? did give up my man cave, but What?
like this a lot better.

1:22:21.106 --> 1:22:23.471
Yeah, well, you know what they say,

1:22:23.496 --> 1:22:25.731
a family makes a house a home.

1:22:25.756 --> 1:22:29.341
Yes. And What? think this little girl
will be the perfect addition

1:22:29.366 --> 1:22:31.221
to our house.

1:22:31.246 --> 1:22:32.261
You mean home.

1:22:32.286 --> 1:22:33.301
Right.

1:22:36.486 --> 1:22:39.611
LAUGHTER

1:22:47.805 --> 1:22:48.900
Ooh!
