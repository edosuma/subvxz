02:36.640 --> 02:39.598
"Do you ever have emotions
that you can't explain?

02:40.640 --> 02:44.997
"Have you ever lost control
of these emotions?

02:46.040 --> 02:49.600
"Do these emotions have a name?"

02:49.600 --> 02:51.400
These were the first three questions

02:51.400 --> 02:54.080
that Dr Malicent asked of Joseph Kinkirk

02:54.080 --> 02:56.080
just six hours after his arrest,

02:56.080 --> 02:59.440
to which Kinkirk answered,

02:59.440 --> 03:03.920
"Yes, yes, and Henry."

03:03.920 --> 03:05.520
This course of exchange

03:05.520 --> 03:08.200
laid the foundation
for a defence that failed

03:08.200 --> 03:12.800
not only because of the meticulously
collected physical evidence, um,

03:12.800 --> 03:16.040
but also because of
the currently accepted opinion

03:16.040 --> 03:17.680
in modern psychology -

03:17.680 --> 03:21.960
multiple personality syndrome
does not exist.

03:21.960 --> 03:25.600
It was a psychological fad,

03:25.600 --> 03:27.960
a therapist-induced disorder

03:27.960 --> 03:32.360
perpetuated by an unending barrage
of TV talk shows and novels

03:32.360 --> 03:35.670
and ill-conceived Hollywood movies.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.960
Joseph Kinkirk
has been under observation

03:38.960 --> 03:43.000
at various psychiatric institutions
for most of his adult life

03:43.000 --> 03:48.360
and yet there has not been
one documented reference to Henry

03:48.360 --> 03:51.079
until after his arrest.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.920
Henry did not abduct Sarah McKenzie.

03:54.920 --> 03:59.280
He didn't strip her naked
or tie her to a bed in the cellar.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.880
He didn't rape her 12-year-old body

04:01.880 --> 04:05.600
or attempt to remove her ovaries
with a box cutter.

04:05.600 --> 04:07.160
And he didn't videotape

04:07.160 --> 04:09.880
the two hours it took Sarah
to bleed to death

04:09.880 --> 04:11.560
when that operation failed.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.440
Henry did not commit
these atrocities because...

04:15.440 --> 04:18.351
...Henry does not exist.

04:20.279 --> 04:24.034
Joseph Kinkirk is fully aware
of his actions...

04:26.400 --> 04:29.597
...just as he was
when he committed them.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.600
It's after midnight, I'm afraid.
I know.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.717
I need two shots of tequila, a waterback
and some volume on the TV.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.000
Please.

04:51.000 --> 04:52.592
Certainly.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.120
<i>At one minute past midnight</i>.

04:56.120 --> 04:59.200
<i>The State of Missouri began the execution</i>

04:59.200 --> 05:02.715
<i>of Joseph Kinkirk by lethal injection.</i>

05:03.880 --> 05:06.760
<i>With no reprieve coming</i>
<i>from the Governor's office...</i>

05:08.800 --> 05:11.234
Oh, God.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.440
Can I have two...
two more shots, please?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.240
Would you like me
to change the channel?

05:18.240 --> 05:20.160
No, that's fine.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.240
<i>...and Mr Kinkirk was pronounced dead</i>

05:22.240 --> 05:24.760
<i>at 18 minutes past the hour.</i>

05:24.760 --> 05:26.320
<i>As you've just heard</i>.

05:26.320 --> 05:29.880
<i>Joseph Kinkirk has been put to death</i>
<i>in a Missouri state prison.</i>

05:29.880 --> 05:32.720
<i>We will have further reaction</i>
<i>to this execution...</i>

05:53.760 --> 05:56.280
- Hello.
- Hi, Mommy!

05:56.280 --> 05:59.440
Hi, sweetie.
I miss you.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.400
I miss you too.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.880
What's that noise?

06:03.880 --> 06:06.480
Uncle Stephen's making breakfast.

06:06.480 --> 06:08.680
OK, now can we go to Starbucks?

06:08.680 --> 06:10.160
How was last night?

06:10.160 --> 06:12.320
We watched 'Night of the Living Dead'.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.390
Oh, no - secrets! Shh.
Put your uncle on the phone.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.800
Mommy wants to talk to you.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.360
So did you see them
fry the bad guy last night?

06:22.360 --> 06:25.840
It was lethal injection. And no.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.320
You get shit-faced as usual?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.040
Watch your language in front of Sammy.

06:29.040 --> 06:32.120
Sorry. Did you, as usual, get shit-faced?

06:32.120 --> 06:35.112
I'm running late.
I'll see you this afternoon, OK?

06:36.600 --> 06:38.033
Hello?

06:39.080 --> 06:42.038
Hey. Hey! That's rude.
Your mother hung up on me.

06:52.280 --> 06:53.760
Dad, can I call you back?

06:53.760 --> 06:56.720
I'm just at the airport...
I need your opinion on a patient!

06:56.720 --> 06:59.160
You 're shouting again.
Am I?

06:59.160 --> 07:00.640
Sorry!

07:00.640 --> 07:03.960
Look, I think you 'll find this one
to be very interesting.

07:03.960 --> 07:06.120
Just send me the file and I'll look it over.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.640
No, no, you have to meet him.

07:07.640 --> 07:11.960
I'll pick you up at the airport.
Just give him one hour.

07:11.960 --> 07:14.280
You can't expect me to rearrange my life

07:14.280 --> 07:17.600
every time you dig up
some medical oddity.

07:17.600 --> 07:20.000
Did you hang up?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.513
Dad?

07:22.560 --> 07:23.549
Hi.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.920
So where'd you find
this David Bernburg?

07:33.920 --> 07:36.200
He was referred to me by Dr Foster.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.680
Charlie?
Mm-hm.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.160
Well, that figures.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.240
David was picked up for vagrancy

07:41.240 --> 07:44.440
and then released into Charlie's care
the next day.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.440
Well, how long has
he been a patient here?

07:46.440 --> 07:48.560
Couple of days. Since the weekend.

07:48.560 --> 07:50.400
That's all?
Mm-hm.

07:50.400 --> 07:52.320
You usually like
to treat them for a month

07:52.320 --> 07:54.120
before you let me pick them apart.

07:54.120 --> 07:58.400
Ah, but this one
has a whole new kind of act.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.072
Oh, yeah?

08:01.480 --> 08:03.072
Enjoy.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.280
Can we get a little heat going in here?

08:30.280 --> 08:31.759
Sure.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.440
Hi.

08:42.440 --> 08:43.873
Hi.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.831
Thank you.
Sure.

08:49.800 --> 08:53.600
I'm Dr Cara Jessup.
And you must be David.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.840
David Bernburg. Is that right?

08:55.840 --> 08:57.320
Yes.

08:57.320 --> 09:00.040
'Bernburg' - is that German?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.553
I don't know.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.160
Do you know why we're here?

09:05.160 --> 09:07.520
You want to ask me some questions.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.800
Is that alright with you?

09:09.800 --> 09:11.360
Yes.

09:11.360 --> 09:15.040
OK. Have you been in a wheelchair
your entire life?

09:15.040 --> 09:16.519
No.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.280
I had an accident a few years back.

09:20.280 --> 09:22.240
OK.

09:22.240 --> 09:24.640
Are you left- or right-handed?

09:24.640 --> 09:26.153
Right.

09:27.440 --> 09:32.753
And, um, in your childhood home,
how many windows are there?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.800
10.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.280
11 if you count
the star window in the door.

09:47.280 --> 09:48.880
But it didn't open.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.760
OK, so when you 're
counting these windows,

09:52.760 --> 09:56.200
are you inside or outside the house?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.920
Inside. It's warmer.

09:58.920 --> 10:00.433
Mm-hm.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.349
Were you raised in any religion?

10:08.560 --> 10:11.720
Ma'am, I was raised in the mountains.

10:11.720 --> 10:15.315
God held our hand
and the devil waited for us to fall.

10:19.120 --> 10:22.080
I'd like to show you
a series of abstract images

10:22.080 --> 10:25.868
and I'd like you to just describe
any thought that comes to mind, OK?

10:30.680 --> 10:33.400
Two small children.
Mm-hm.

10:33.400 --> 10:38.040
And they're playing that game, um...

10:38.040 --> 10:41.760
Patty cake, patty cake...
OK, OK. Good.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.193
And this one?

10:44.920 --> 10:48.000
It looks like an elephant in the circus.

10:48.000 --> 10:50.560
Is it a big elephant?

10:50.560 --> 10:53.836
No, a baby elephant.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.440
Do you see any numbers in the circle?

10:58.480 --> 10:59.960
16.
OK.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.800
How about this one?

11:02.800 --> 11:05.473
73.
Sure.

11:07.640 --> 11:10.677
Do you ever have any emotions
you can't explain?

11:13.480 --> 11:14.913
No.

11:16.160 --> 11:21.632
Do you ever feel angry or violent
or depressed for no apparent reason?

11:24.760 --> 11:26.432
No.

11:27.560 --> 11:30.440
OK. Thank you very much.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.840
Alright, Dad, I'm waiting.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.400
For what?

11:35.400 --> 11:39.480
Well, you didn't bring me here
to meet David, did you?

11:39.480 --> 11:41.200
Mind if I make a call?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.873
No, I got nothing but time.
Go right ahead.

12:20.520 --> 12:22.960
Hello.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.396
This is Dr Harding. Is Adam there?

12:28.080 --> 12:32.631
I'm sorry, Dr Harding.
I'm the only one here.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.920
I'd like you to look for him.

12:46.200 --> 12:48.191
What was that?

12:56.080 --> 12:57.760
This is Adam.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.560
Adam, it's Dr Harding.

12:59.560 --> 13:04.520
I wonder if you would have a moment
to speak with a colleague of mine?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.112
Sure.

13:11.680 --> 13:14.120
You didn't need to do that.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.880
Do what?

13:15.880 --> 13:19.668
Show off. It makes you
look like a charlatan.

13:30.400 --> 13:31.913
Hello.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.520
I'm Dr Jessup.

13:35.520 --> 13:39.080
Jessup? You 're Dr Harding's daughter?

13:39.080 --> 13:40.880
Yes, I am. And you 're Adam.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.360
Your husband was murdered, right?

13:42.360 --> 13:43.713
Ooh.

13:44.960 --> 13:48.120
Yes.
How?

13:48.120 --> 13:50.360
His throat was slit by a mugger.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.640
When?
Three years ago.

13:52.640 --> 13:54.680
Where?

13:54.680 --> 13:57.797
When we were walking home from
church on Christmas Eve.

14:01.400 --> 14:04.280
You think that was rude of me?
Not at all.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.280
I'm used to it.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.080
Aggressive role manipulation
is a common avoidance technique

14:09.080 --> 14:11.760
used by borderline personalities
during therapy.

14:11.760 --> 14:15.520
But you knew that, didn't you?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.360
Attagirl.

14:17.360 --> 14:20.716
I have to watch out for your
exploitative pathological tendencies.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.760
Ready to answer some questions?

14:23.760 --> 14:25.830
Shoot.

14:27.160 --> 14:30.080
In your childhood home,
how many windows are there?

14:30.080 --> 14:31.800
One.

14:31.800 --> 14:34.280
One?
Mm-hm.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.160
Actually, two if you count the windshield.

14:37.160 --> 14:38.673
I see.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.040
Were you raised in any religion?

14:43.040 --> 14:44.837
Catholic.
Mm-hm.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.000
OK, Adam, I have a series
of abstract images here.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.280
I'd like you to take a look at them...

14:51.280 --> 14:56.760
Dancers, moth, elephants, the Devil.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.160
I've seen all this stuff before, Doctor.

14:59.160 --> 15:02.640
Yes, you have. Clearly.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.640
OK, Adam.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.240
Do you see any numbers in the circles?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.080
Nope.

15:09.080 --> 15:12.280
And this one?

15:12.280 --> 15:13.793
No.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.397
Great. Great.

15:20.440 --> 15:22.476
What about this one?

15:25.520 --> 15:27.033
The number seven.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.793
OK.

15:36.360 --> 15:39.670
OK, Adam, um...
may I look at your eyes?

15:47.240 --> 15:49.834
Are you wearing contact lenses?

15:51.440 --> 15:55.035
No. This is their natural colour.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.840
Are you colourblind?

16:00.840 --> 16:04.230
Red deficient, since birth.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.200
OK, Adam, I think we're done here.

16:09.200 --> 16:12.033
Thank you very much
for your cooperation.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.189
Can I go now?

16:25.480 --> 16:27.240
You set me up.

16:27.240 --> 16:31.080
No, no. I offered you a chance
to reconsider some of your assumptions.

16:31.080 --> 16:33.680
Adam is the host. David is the alter.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.800
Why didn't you let me
interview Adam first?

16:35.800 --> 16:38.109
Where's the fun in that?

16:51.320 --> 16:52.800
Hello!
Mommy!

16:52.800 --> 16:54.800
Hello!
Hello!

16:54.800 --> 16:57.280
I missed you so much!

16:57.280 --> 16:59.360
Yay!
Hey, Pop.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.640
Hey, Stevo. This is quite a rig.
Mm-hm.

17:01.640 --> 17:03.120
Hah.
Hey, Grandpa.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.599
There's my angel. How you doing?

17:05.599 --> 17:07.319
Go get your stuff, OK?
OK.

17:07.319 --> 17:09.079
I'll help you.
She have fun?

17:09.079 --> 17:11.839
Uh, she was pretty cranky
till that second beer set in.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.280
You staying for dinner?
No.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.520
Sammy's got school in the morning.
Mm-hm.

17:16.520 --> 17:21.359
You OK? I mean, really OK?

17:21.359 --> 17:22.920
Yeah, I'll be OK.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.280
What are you working on?

17:27.280 --> 17:29.040
Oh, I'm just offlining an industrial.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.040
Oh, great.

17:31.040 --> 17:33.200
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

17:33.200 --> 17:34.680
No.
No.

17:34.680 --> 17:37.360
OK, here we are.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.240
Did you say thank you
to Uncle Stephen, honey?

17:39.240 --> 17:41.040
Thank you, Uncle Stephen.

17:41.040 --> 17:43.120
Sammy, next time
you bring the beers, OK?

17:43.120 --> 17:44.280
OK.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.640
I gotta tell you, I'm loving these
underage drinking jokes.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.120
Thank you.
Just loving them.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.720
Thank you very much.
Mm-hm. 'Bye!

17:49.720 --> 17:51.720
Goodbye. Get off my property.
- 'Bye.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.200
Don't pull all the way up
into the driveway.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.520
Why?

17:57.520 --> 17:59.360
It'll be too tight for me to get out.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.079
You 'll be able to get out.
No, it's...

18:04.440 --> 18:09.440
Yep.
Thanks, Pop. This is perfect.

18:09.440 --> 18:13.560
Hey, honey, get in the bathtub, OK?
And then we'll have dinner.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.073
OK, Mom!

18:19.280 --> 18:20.920
What's that?

18:20.920 --> 18:24.480
Adam's file. Take a look.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.152
I'll think about it.

19:22.680 --> 19:26.120
I don't seem to have much time
for God nowadays, Doctor.

19:26.120 --> 19:29.560
It seems to work both ways.

19:29.560 --> 19:32.640
Hows about you? Got your faith?

19:32.640 --> 19:35.600
My daughter
lost her husband not too long ago.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.320
He was a good, good man

19:37.320 --> 19:40.680
and he was murdered
for no reason at all.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.120
Murdered?
Mm-hm.

19:43.120 --> 19:45.480
So I find it kind of hard to believe

19:45.480 --> 19:47.311
in a God that could hurt my daughter...

19:48.880 --> 19:52.160
...is Adam there?

19:52.160 --> 19:55.920
I'm sorry,
Dr Harding. I'm the only one here.

20:24.160 --> 20:25.720
Little CC.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.800
Hey, Charlie. You look terrible.

20:28.800 --> 20:30.520
Well, thank you.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.840
A course of antibiotics, I'll be fine.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.360
Alright.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

20:35.360 --> 20:36.840
Um, Adam Saber.

20:36.840 --> 20:40.760
I want to know how he came to you
and why you dumped him on my father.

20:40.760 --> 20:44.080
The police found him laying in the street.

20:44.080 --> 20:49.440
He didn't appear intoxicated.
Claimed he wasn't able to walk.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.800
Gave his name as David Bernburg.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.680
By the time I examined him,

20:53.680 --> 20:57.680
he was up on his feet,
calling himself Adam Saber,

20:57.680 --> 21:01.600
said he had no idea
how he got to the hospital.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.600
Well, I thought of
your father immediately.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.960
Well, yeah, sure.

21:05.960 --> 21:11.353
Um, have you ever had a patient
who was colourblind in just one eye?

21:12.720 --> 21:14.280
No. Why?

21:14.280 --> 21:16.400
I was just thinking it might explain...

21:16.400 --> 21:18.360
Never mind.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.640
How's Sammy?
She's great.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.200
Soccer-crazy.

21:22.200 --> 21:24.840
There are tryouts at the school
this Friday. You should come.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.920
I'd like that.
Good.

21:26.920 --> 21:31.480
Um, can I get a copy of his hospital file?

21:31.480 --> 21:34.800
I'll fax it this afternoon.
Thank you.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.960
Take care of yourself, alright?
Yeah.

21:36.960 --> 21:38.640
I will. You take care of that kid.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.120
Yeah. Always.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.440
Um, does Ellie still work in radiology?

21:43.440 --> 21:45.840
Yeah, but she's up
on the third floor now.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.840
Alright. Thanks again.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.273
'Bye.

22:01.200 --> 22:04.320
Is it possible that
when he wrenches his neck,

22:04.320 --> 22:06.000
he's compressing,
decompressing a nerve

22:06.000 --> 22:09.200
and causing some kind
of temporary paralysis?

22:09.200 --> 22:11.320
Look.

22:11.320 --> 22:15.280
This X-ray - the third, the fourth,
the fifth vertebrae...

22:15.280 --> 22:17.880
Fused.
Mmm.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.520
So we're looking at X-rays here
of two different people.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.640
Two different people.

22:22.640 --> 22:26.160
It's a hoax - a guy, the doctor.

22:26.160 --> 22:28.280
The doctor?
Sure.

22:28.280 --> 22:32.796
How well do you know him?
Well, some days, not at all.

22:46.880 --> 22:49.440
Gets under your skin, doesn't he?

22:49.440 --> 22:52.591
These aren't his films. They can't be.

22:53.680 --> 22:57.280
Isn't it possible
that what you 're looking at

22:57.280 --> 22:59.200
is actually what you 're seeing?

22:59.200 --> 23:02.560
No, because this is not possible.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.040
Adam is the real deal.
No.

23:04.040 --> 23:05.520
He is a desperately ill young man,

23:05.520 --> 23:07.880
but he's fully aware of David
and all of David's actions.

23:07.880 --> 23:10.400
David is pure invention
and I'll prove it to you.

23:10.400 --> 23:15.480
You know what? We haven't had
dinner together in over a month.

23:15.480 --> 23:17.280
Well, you 're coming to Easter,
aren't you?

23:17.280 --> 23:19.440
Uh-huh.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.040
Do you want me to bring anything?

23:21.040 --> 23:22.712
Just your delightful self.

23:26.560 --> 23:28.760
That's my girl.
Yeah.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.955
Thanks.
Thank you.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.393
OK, what name?

23:42.520 --> 23:46.920
So, David Bernburg,
Shadywood High School, Shadywood.

23:46.920 --> 23:49.354
Shadywood.

23:54.800 --> 23:57.600
Sorry, Doctor. Scared you a little
right there, huh?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.320
Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.

23:59.320 --> 24:01.440
Listen, uh, I didn't want you to leave

24:01.440 --> 24:03.240
without having a chance
to say thank you.

24:03.240 --> 24:04.878
For what?

24:06.520 --> 24:08.511
For trying to help.

24:11.080 --> 24:12.559
Thanks.
You 're welcome.

24:28.480 --> 24:32.000
Excuse me. I'm looking for yearbooks.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.480
Second aisle down to the back.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.680
But you best be quick.
I'm locking up in 10 minutes.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.671
No, I'll be quick. I promise.

24:40.040 --> 24:41.473
OK.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.756
Are you almost done?

25:32.040 --> 25:34.190
Um, I'll be done in a minute.

26:06.960 --> 26:11.120
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
Bless the bed that I lay on

26:11.120 --> 26:15.680
Bless me as they lay me down to sleep
I give myself to God to keep

26:15.680 --> 26:20.280
Five little angels round my bed
One to the foot and one to the head

26:20.280 --> 26:25.877
One to sing and one to pray
And one to take my sins away.

26:34.280 --> 26:36.316
Amen.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.710
She doesn't mean it.

26:47.200 --> 26:48.758
Right?

27:01.120 --> 27:03.800
Hello.
Charlie?

27:03.800 --> 27:06.600
Oh, little CC.

27:06.600 --> 27:08.560
You sound terrible.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.640
Listen, listen. Can I bring you anything?

27:11.640 --> 27:13.960
Uh, no. I've got soup.

27:13.960 --> 27:18.600
And, um, that antibiotic's
about to kick in.

27:18.600 --> 27:24.240
I hate to ask, but you never
faxed me Adam Saber's file.

27:24.240 --> 27:26.920
Oh, I'm sorry. Is first thing alright?

27:26.920 --> 27:29.559
Yeah, yeah, of course.
Just get some rest, OK?

27:30.600 --> 27:32.440
I will.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.400
See you soon.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.320
OK. Feel better.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.120
Excuse me.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.759
Do you know the way
to the Quarry House?

29:47.920 --> 29:49.831
I don't know how I got to the hospital.

29:50.880 --> 29:53.280
I have no idea
how I got to bed last night.

29:53.280 --> 29:56.120
You know, I just wake up in my room
and I don't remember nothing.

29:57.720 --> 30:00.720
The nurses
helped you into your bed.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.880
Was I awake?

30:02.880 --> 30:05.110
In a matter of speaking.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.351
Hello?

32:03.960 --> 32:05.680
They're ruined, aren't they?

32:05.680 --> 32:09.320
I... I'm sorry. I knocked at the front door.

32:09.320 --> 32:12.360
I was...
I found them this morning.

32:12.360 --> 32:15.200
They must have been
in water for weeks.

32:15.200 --> 32:19.560
All that music, all that life, all gone.

32:19.560 --> 32:23.400
I think... I think some of it
can be saved, actually.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.709
Well, there's always hope.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.720
Now, who are you?

32:28.720 --> 32:31.240
I'm looking for David Bernburg.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.360
David?
Yeah.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.828
You 're standing on him, aren't you?

32:51.040 --> 32:53.679
Well, it happens around
this time of year -

32:54.720 --> 32:56.280
some local reporter

32:56.280 --> 32:59.280
inevitably stumbles onto
a story in the archives

32:59.280 --> 33:03.640
and tries to resurrect it
as a cautionary tale.

33:03.640 --> 33:06.029
Are you talking about David's accident?

33:07.240 --> 33:09.037
No, my dear.

33:11.160 --> 33:13.310
His murder.

33:20.600 --> 33:22.640
How did his accident happen?

33:22.640 --> 33:24.560
He fell.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.440
Wet leaves on stone steps.

33:28.440 --> 33:33.195
And just like that
his life had to begin again.

33:36.520 --> 33:40.115
But he accepted his fate
with such nobility.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.680
For three years,

33:43.680 --> 33:48.595
David showed the world how brightly
the Holy Spirit shone within him.

33:50.800 --> 33:55.715
But then... David lost his way.

34:00.680 --> 34:03.800
He found a doctor in the city

34:03.800 --> 34:09.351
who was experimenting with spinal
replacement or some such nonsense.

34:10.520 --> 34:13.400
David came to believe
that this practitioner

34:13.400 --> 34:16.233
would one day give him back his legs.

34:17.280 --> 34:18.760
It seemed as if every month,

34:18.760 --> 34:22.355
he'd ride into the city on the bus
with hope in his eyes...

34:23.480 --> 34:28.600
...only to be injected and sliced open

34:28.600 --> 34:32.672
and return broken-hearted.

34:33.719 --> 34:36.800
And then one month he left home

34:36.800 --> 34:39.438
and never returned.

34:42.199 --> 34:45.795
It was one week later
when they found his remains.

34:46.920 --> 34:52.472
He'd... been taken into the woods
and abused.

34:53.520 --> 34:55.033
Tortured.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.834
Can you imagine?

35:00.880 --> 35:04.560
David sitting there, watching,

35:04.560 --> 35:06.680
unable to fight back,

35:06.680 --> 35:10.720
watching as they did those
unspeakable things to him?

35:10.720 --> 35:13.240
I... I cannot. I...

35:13.240 --> 35:15.595
And I pray you never will.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.600
David turned his back on God

35:22.600 --> 35:25.637
and looked to science for his answers.

35:26.960 --> 35:30.270
The Lord told us quite plainly.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.515
"Wane not, thy faith in me."

35:52.640 --> 35:56.680
Hey, Art. I'll have a cup of coffee
and some of that apple pie, huh?

35:56.680 --> 36:00.200
Hi, honey bun.
Did you have a good time, hmm?

36:00.200 --> 36:02.280
No. We had a bird funeral.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.160
Great. Great.
Mmm, yeah.

36:05.160 --> 36:08.160
Well, do you want to pick out a treat
while I talk to Grandpa?

36:08.160 --> 36:09.912
OK, go ahead.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.720
What's the fundamental difference

36:15.720 --> 36:19.760
between a disassociated personality
and a delusional one?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.240
No hello?

36:21.240 --> 36:23.680
'Cause I have something.
Yeah?

36:23.680 --> 36:30.520
OK, so the real David Bernburg
was born on February 5, 1963.

36:30.520 --> 36:35.200
He slipped and broke his back
in November of 1979.

36:35.200 --> 36:39.160
In April of 1982, he was murdered.

36:39.160 --> 36:42.840
Now, while every local TV station
and newspaper

36:42.840 --> 36:46.360
was recounting the details
of his horrific death,

36:46.360 --> 36:50.720
your Adam Saber was six years old,
his mother had just died

36:50.720 --> 36:53.600
and he'd been placed in
the first of several foster homes.

36:53.600 --> 36:56.880
His escape was this...
this macabre murder.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.920
Now, everything
that Adam knew of David

36:59.920 --> 37:03.440
he would have gleaned
from the media, right?

37:03.440 --> 37:07.080
OK, well, say that I agree with these...

37:07.080 --> 37:09.480
...somewhat shaky assumptions.

37:09.480 --> 37:13.520
Why would Adam create a delusion?

37:13.520 --> 37:16.160
Give me your wallet.

37:16.160 --> 37:18.196
Any wallet will do?
Mm-hm.

37:19.240 --> 37:21.320
Alright.

37:21.320 --> 37:25.440
So why do you carry
this picture of Mom?

37:25.440 --> 37:27.000
To remind me of her.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.960
Mm-hm, and experience the positive
effects that these memories evoke.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.440
Yeah.
Yes.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.880
Now, if this picture existed
but you had no awareness of it,

37:34.880 --> 37:37.320
would you still be able
to benefit from its existence?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.040
I suppose not, no.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.520
Oh, OK.

37:40.520 --> 37:43.000
So I believe, as a child,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.520
Adam Saber began carrying around
a mental picture of David

37:46.520 --> 37:50.480
so that no matter where he went,
no matter how horrific things became,

37:50.480 --> 37:52.440
there was always someone
who had it worse -

37:52.440 --> 37:54.320
David Bernburg
who was tortured to death

37:54.320 --> 37:56.200
by Satan-worshipping
mountain witches.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.960
But to benefit from this mental image,

37:58.960 --> 38:01.040
he must be fully aware of it

38:01.040 --> 38:04.396
and therefore
cannot be disassociated.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.959
That is a very compelling diagnosis.
Thank you very much.

38:11.200 --> 38:12.760
How are you gonna prove it?

38:12.760 --> 38:17.760
Oh, oh, Dad, I'm not gonna prove it.

38:17.760 --> 38:19.880
I'm gonna cure it.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.800
Hello, Mrs Bernburg.

38:26.800 --> 38:30.480
Thank you again for agreeing
to help me with this.

38:30.480 --> 38:36.240
I wanted to tell you that, um, Adam has
created an impersonation of your son.

38:36.240 --> 38:40.120
I, um... I don't want you to be alarmed.

38:40.120 --> 38:44.520
I've raised three boys
and said prayers upon their graves.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.240
Not much alarms me.

38:46.240 --> 38:49.400
Thank you. I do appreciate it.

38:49.400 --> 38:50.992
Here's... this is Adam now.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.120
Hello, Adam.
Hey.

38:55.120 --> 38:57.315
This is Dita Bernburg.

38:58.680 --> 39:01.717
Is the name familiar to you at all?
Nope.

39:04.040 --> 39:08.960
Er, her son David
was murdered 25 years ago.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.678
Shit.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.920
I'm sorry.

39:13.920 --> 39:16.360
You may have heard of it.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.120
It was in the papers.

39:18.120 --> 39:22.671
25 years ago? I was, like, 6 years old.

39:23.960 --> 39:25.871
I didn't read the papers much.
Mm-hm.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.000
You gonna get that?

39:50.000 --> 39:52.230
No-one knows I'm here.
It's probably for you.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.440
Yo, this is Adam.

39:58.440 --> 40:00.590
I'd like to speak with David, please.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.920
There's no David here.

40:27.560 --> 40:28.993
Momma?

40:34.720 --> 40:36.200
You found me, Momma.

40:36.200 --> 40:40.080
My son is dead.

40:40.080 --> 40:44.040
No, Momma. I'm not dead.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.640
You are not my son.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.471
Yes, I am.

40:51.280 --> 40:53.760
We live at the Quarry House
on Tull Road.

40:53.760 --> 40:57.360
I was able to find
your address in the phone book.

40:57.360 --> 40:59.794
My bedroom used to be a library.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.430
You used to fold the clothes
on the shelves like books.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.280
Stop it.
Yeah.

41:08.280 --> 41:12.960
You used to say, "What clothes
shall we read today, David?"

41:12.960 --> 41:14.393
No.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.120
My bed.

41:21.120 --> 41:24.280
My bed was made from harvest wood

41:24.280 --> 41:27.880
to keep me safe from the spirits.

41:27.880 --> 41:30.640
My son died 25 years ago.

41:30.640 --> 41:32.790
You have a nail in your pocket.

41:40.120 --> 41:41.838
How could you know that?

41:43.560 --> 41:45.676
No-one knows that, only...

41:48.920 --> 41:50.558
We found it in in Askern Mine.

41:56.880 --> 41:59.155
You always carry it, Momma.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.710
David.
Momma.

42:33.960 --> 42:35.757
Iron from the earth...

42:37.160 --> 42:38.878
...to ward off evil.

42:44.480 --> 42:46.516
To ward off evil.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.352
Yes.

42:52.480 --> 42:54.440
Then it's not working.

43:01.080 --> 43:03.640
I know there's a rational
explanation for this. Just wait for me.

43:03.640 --> 43:05.676
Momma!

44:25.120 --> 44:27.918
Yeah, this is it.
You can get him out of the van.

44:29.840 --> 44:32.600
You want me to come with you?
No, we'll be fine.

44:32.600 --> 44:35.239
Are you sure?
Yeah.

44:36.440 --> 44:37.919
Alright.

44:40.560 --> 44:41.993
I'll be fine.

45:10.360 --> 45:13.796
Alright, David,
do you know where you are?

45:15.920 --> 45:17.353
No, ma'am.

45:18.800 --> 45:24.158
Well, there's no reason
that you should recognise this place.

45:29.240 --> 45:30.673
What is it?

45:32.080 --> 45:33.560
What's the matter.

45:33.560 --> 45:36.840
I was here at night.
What?

45:36.840 --> 45:39.035
That's why I didn't recognise this place.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.877
Things are different.

45:46.320 --> 45:47.878
It was snowing.

45:49.640 --> 45:51.437
Right there, there was a shed.

45:57.600 --> 45:59.960
David?

45:59.960 --> 46:01.598
He's coming.
Who's coming?

46:05.840 --> 46:07.320
Who's coming?

46:07.320 --> 46:08.958
Shhh.
Just tell me.

46:11.720 --> 46:13.119
It's alright. It's alright.

46:14.680 --> 46:17.752
Tell me. Tell me, who is it?
Who is it? Who's coming?

46:20.560 --> 46:21.993
The Devil.

46:27.160 --> 46:29.400
I'm sorry. Alright, I'm sorry.
Please don't leave me.

46:29.400 --> 46:32.440
Please don't leave me.
I'm gonna take you back to the van.

46:32.440 --> 46:34.280
OK? I'm taking you...
Alright. Here we go, OK.

46:34.280 --> 46:37.480
It's alright.

46:37.480 --> 46:39.360
Please, please, please
get me out of here.

46:39.360 --> 46:41.360
Listen, the chair is stuck.

46:41.360 --> 46:43.280
I have to go back...
No! No, please.

46:43.280 --> 46:45.794
Please don't leave me.
Alright, OK. Alright. OK.

46:47.280 --> 46:49.320
Just... I need to get a signal.

46:49.320 --> 46:51.320
I'm just gonna walk away
and get a signal, OK?

46:51.320 --> 46:52.833
You 're alright. You 're alright.

47:07.800 --> 47:09.680
Hey, Cara.
Hi, Virgil.

47:09.680 --> 47:12.120
Something wrong?
No, no, I'm alright.

47:12.120 --> 47:14.920
The chair is stuck
and I need you to push it out.

47:14.920 --> 47:17.240
Alright. Let me find something.
I'll be right there.

47:17.240 --> 47:19.674
Thanks. OK. 'Bye.

47:31.880 --> 47:34.120
Let's see what we've got.

47:34.120 --> 47:35.758
Stuck, huh?

47:36.960 --> 47:38.393
Hi, Adam.

47:43.160 --> 47:44.593
Who's Adam?

47:47.320 --> 47:48.753
Here we go.

47:50.880 --> 47:55.200
My name is Dr Caroline Jessup.
Yeah, we'll get to you later.

47:55.200 --> 47:57.240
Adam...
I asked who Adam was.

47:57.240 --> 47:59.800
Adam is a patient of mine.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.240
Are you alright?

48:04.240 --> 48:07.080
You feel confused?
Confused?

48:07.080 --> 48:10.160
You don't tell me
when to be confused, lady.

48:10.160 --> 48:14.040
You 're not the one who keeps waking up
in strange goddamn places

48:14.040 --> 48:15.680
with no idea how you got there.

48:15.680 --> 48:18.400
So I asked you a question.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.631
Where am I?
And why would you think I was Adam?

48:23.480 --> 48:27.712
You 're at Walker's Mill.
And you look like Adam.

48:32.120 --> 48:33.320
Hey!

48:33.320 --> 48:37.640
Caroline, are you alright?
Yeah. We're fine.

48:37.640 --> 48:41.360
I was, um... I'm just... I'm talking to, er...

48:41.360 --> 48:44.033
Wes.
Wes.

48:47.080 --> 48:49.640
Morning, Virgil.
Hey, Wesley.

49:01.600 --> 49:04.920
Right. There we go. Beautiful.
- Catch. Catch it.

49:04.920 --> 49:06.640
Nice, alright. Take a shot.
Dad!

49:06.640 --> 49:08.880
Dad.
Yeah.

49:08.880 --> 49:12.000
I need to talk to you.
OK. I'll be right back.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.360
Why are you...
I just met Wes!

49:14.360 --> 49:15.840
Wh...

49:15.840 --> 49:19.360
Why, Dad? Why?
Why do you do this to me?

49:19.360 --> 49:21.680
Because you 've stopped
asking questions.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.920
That's all I do. That's all I do all day long.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.480
That's all I do, Dad.
No, no!

49:25.480 --> 49:28.840
You 've stopped asking questions
of yourself, Caroline!

49:28.840 --> 49:32.720
You 've developed
this fixed system of beliefs

49:32.720 --> 49:35.760
which you refuse to submit
to any kind of introspection.

49:35.760 --> 49:38.240
So what that means is
that you will never have

49:38.240 --> 49:40.160
a new thought in your professional life.

49:40.160 --> 49:43.400
You have got to learn to
take those ideas, set them to one side

49:43.400 --> 49:47.480
and try to move ahead with
one big question, which is, "Why?"!

49:47.480 --> 49:51.360
And simply ask, "What?"
To just say, "I don't know."

49:51.360 --> 49:53.400
Just because you 're older,
it doesn't mean you 're right.

49:53.400 --> 49:55.595
It might mean
that you 've been wrong for longer.

49:57.080 --> 49:58.640
What has been your motivation here?

49:58.640 --> 50:01.400
Has it been to help Adam
to discover whatever...

50:01.400 --> 50:04.520
...crisis it is that caused him
to fracture his psyche?

50:04.520 --> 50:09.230
Or has it been to simply flat out
prove me wrong?

50:12.960 --> 50:14.393
Hmm?

50:16.760 --> 50:18.910
Oh, hon.
Come on, don't!

50:21.240 --> 50:23.360
Alright, everybody go take a shower now.

50:23.360 --> 50:24.315
Honey!

50:43.200 --> 50:46.760
OK, so, Wesley Crite was a frontman
for an underground rock band.

50:46.760 --> 50:49.760
He died November 1994.

50:49.760 --> 50:51.520
It was a possible suicide.

50:51.520 --> 50:57.640
At this exact point,
Adam Saber is in prison.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.920
He's just been placed
in solitary confinement.

50:59.920 --> 51:03.880
So at this low, low moment in his life,

51:03.880 --> 51:08.032
he assumes yet another person
who has a story worse than his own.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.672
OK.

51:14.160 --> 51:15.593
OK.

51:17.200 --> 51:18.315
Good.

51:26.520 --> 51:28.080
Hello, Wesley.

51:28.080 --> 51:30.150
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

51:34.040 --> 51:36.600
I have all the time
in the world, Dr Jessup.

51:38.960 --> 51:42.077
I'd like to ask you a few questions,
if that's alright with you.

51:44.360 --> 51:47.033
I would first like to ask you a question.

51:48.520 --> 51:49.760
Yes?

51:49.760 --> 51:53.680
Do you hold that doctorate
in the name of science or God?

51:53.680 --> 51:55.272
Why do you ask?

51:57.760 --> 51:59.432
That thing around your neck.

52:03.360 --> 52:04.793
Mmm.

52:06.680 --> 52:10.355
I'd-I'd like to consider myself
a doctor of science...

52:12.040 --> 52:13.519
...but a woman of God.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.550
There's something I'd like to show you.

52:37.960 --> 52:40.474
November 18, 1994.

52:43.360 --> 52:45.157
Does that mean anything to you?

52:49.640 --> 52:51.160
Get away from me.

52:51.160 --> 52:52.752
Do you know what happened that day?

52:54.040 --> 52:55.234
Get away.

52:56.280 --> 52:57.918
What happened that day?

52:59.400 --> 53:01.120
What do you know about that day?

53:01.120 --> 53:03.440
Get away from me.
Wes.

53:03.440 --> 53:05.510
GET AWAY FROM ME!

53:39.320 --> 53:40.753
David?

53:48.080 --> 53:49.672
Are you alright?

53:51.840 --> 53:53.640
He was here.

53:53.640 --> 53:58.280
Who? Who was here?

54:09.480 --> 54:11.198
Where did you hear that?

54:12.880 --> 54:14.950
I didn't hear it.

54:17.200 --> 54:18.633
I've wrote it.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.720
That's David's song.

54:45.720 --> 54:48.640
Was it ever published?
No.

54:48.640 --> 54:52.840
David made it up in the hospital
after his accident,

54:52.840 --> 54:58.312
and he'd sing it to himself
whenever he became sad or scared.

55:00.320 --> 55:02.000
When he was scared?

55:02.000 --> 55:06.278
It seemed to be a sanctuary for him,
a shelter in the storm.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.676
Is it possible that, um...

55:12.400 --> 55:15.720
...the night he was murdered,
when he was in the woods,

55:15.720 --> 55:18.632
is it possible that he sang this lullaby?

55:20.520 --> 55:22.317
I pray he did.

55:24.360 --> 55:26.720
Hello?
Hey, Dad.

55:26.720 --> 55:28.920
I think that when Adam Saber
was a little boy,

55:28.920 --> 55:31.240
he may have witnessed
David Bernburg's murder.

55:31.240 --> 55:35.240
And David is an escape
from that memory. Maybe Wes is too.

55:35.240 --> 55:37.800
Do you have a home address for Adam?
Why?

55:37.800 --> 55:41.080
Because I wanna know what kind of life
Adam is trying to escape from.

55:41.080 --> 55:44.200
Hey.

55:44.200 --> 55:45.680
Hey there, buddy.

55:52.440 --> 55:54.635
Good boy. Good boy.

56:10.920 --> 56:12.680
Hello!

56:12.680 --> 56:14.240
Hello?

56:14.240 --> 56:17.440
Hey, buddy. Are you all alone?

56:17.440 --> 56:19.080
It's alright. It's alright. I'm gonna come in.

56:19.080 --> 56:20.672
I'm coming in. I'm not gonna hurt you.

56:27.440 --> 56:28.873
Hello?

56:57.040 --> 56:58.520
Oh, shit.

56:58.520 --> 57:01.478
OK. OK, OK.

57:02.600 --> 57:05.040
OK, buddy. Alright.

57:05.040 --> 57:09.670
See if I can find anything.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.955
Here you go. Here you go.

57:19.880 --> 57:21.757
There. Poor thing.

57:30.640 --> 57:32.073
Ugh.

57:43.720 --> 57:45.200
Hello?

57:45.200 --> 57:46.792
Is anybody here?

57:56.440 --> 57:57.873
Hello?

57:59.520 --> 58:01.795
Oh, God. Oh, gosh.

58:03.360 --> 58:06.591
Mmm... Ohh...

58:10.280 --> 58:11.713
Ohh.

58:35.520 --> 58:37.317
Ohh.

58:44.280 --> 58:45.713
OK.

58:55.840 --> 58:57.640
Oh, God.

58:57.640 --> 58:59.756
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

59:23.400 --> 59:24.913
First dead body?

59:26.720 --> 59:28.153
No.

59:29.200 --> 59:32.360
We sent someone to pick up
this Adam Saber for questioning.

59:34.360 --> 59:35.880
Shit! Shit.

59:35.880 --> 59:38.880
Um, I-I... I forgot to pick up
my daughter. I can't stay.

59:38.880 --> 59:40.360
You don't have to be here.
Thanks.

59:40.360 --> 59:42.360
I got it.
Thank you.

59:42.360 --> 59:45.040
- Did you see me?
- You did a great job, honey.

59:45.040 --> 59:46.680
Really, Dad?

59:46.680 --> 59:48.480
Kenna, come on, we're leaving.

59:48.480 --> 59:49.960
I'll be there in one second.

59:52.640 --> 59:54.120
Hello?
Detective Danton?

59:54.120 --> 59:55.600
It's Caroline Jessup.
Hello.

59:55.600 --> 59:57.520
Adam Saber is at my daughter's
elementary school.

59:57.520 --> 59:59.000
You 're sure it's him?
Yeah.

59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.240
Yeah, it's Brockhurst Elementary.
Alright.

01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.720
At the soccer fields.
Alright, I'll...

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.680
Hi.
...send the car and I'll be there.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.035
As soon as you can. Thanks.

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.720
Sammy!

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.440
Sammy!

01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:13.040
You see?
Samantha!

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.760
I told you she'd be here.

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.591
No need to worry.
Samantha!

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.480
Sammy.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:22.360
Samantha. Samantha.

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:26.880
I'm sorry I'm late.
I need you to come over here right now.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.040
But, Mom...
Right now! Get over here!

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.040
Come on. Come on.

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.360
I want you to go and wait
with Brody's mom, OK?

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.440
Is everything alright?
How did you get here?

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.280
I'm not entirely sure.

01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.640
Sammy was wonderful!
I think she's gonna make...

01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:42.712
I want you to stay away from my family!

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.560
But you invited me.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:48.760
I did no such thing.
At the hospital.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.240
What hospital?

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.673
When you came to see me.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.312
CC, are you alright?

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:57.392
What did you call me?

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.873
Little CC.

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:07.240
Who are you?
Oh, for heaven's sake.

01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:09.320
Caroline, it's me.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:10.680
Charles.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.438
I thought we had a rule
about not talking to strangers.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.600
But he knew my name.

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:35.751
And he just wanted to talk to me
until you got there.

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:39.193
What did he want to talk about?

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.440
First he wanted to know family stuff.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.873
Yeah?

01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:48.720
Like what we did this summer.

01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.153
And my birthday.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.440
What about your birthday?

01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.034
If I liked the books he sent me.

01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:01.993
What else?

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:06.033
Then he wanted to know
about God and stuff.

01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.473
What did you tell him?

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.078
That I didn't believe.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.718
Why would you say that, honey?

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:25.151
Because if God was real
he wouldn't have let Daddy die.

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.200
You know, I think...

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:41.120
...I think that God knew
how wonderful Daddy was.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.192
And he wanted him in heaven
to make it a better place.

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:48.631
It's alright that I don't believe, Mommy.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:51.633
Why?

01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:55.120
Grandpa doesn't believe anymore.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:58.157
So whatever happens, I'll be with him.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.793
Here.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:10.273
God loves you.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:13.040
And he always will, OK?

01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.473
OK.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.438
What did you do to your back?

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.920
Don't know.

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.360
It kind of itches.
Oh.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:29.400
I'll put something on it, OK?

01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.880
He, Dad, it's me.

01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.120
Look, I think there's a connection
between Adam and his alters.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.520
They all seem to want to know
if you have faith.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.560
Adam asked you, Wes asked me,
Charles asked Sammy.

01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.800
Charles?
Well...

01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.480
Adam came to Sammy's school
pretending to be Charles.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.471
Caroline, Charles is dead.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.480
What? I... Dad, I just talked to him.

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:54.960
He was sick, but he didn't... I mean...

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.678
Dad, I'm so sorry.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:00.240
Me too.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:02.360
He always had to do everything first.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.360
Are you alright?
Yeah.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:08.793
It's just a tickle.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.353
I love you, sweetheart.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.913
I love you too, Daddy.

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.633
Bye-bye.

01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.468
I noticed a sketchbook in your room.

01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.473
You like to draw, huh?

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.200
Idle hands.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.480
Moses drowning in an unparted sea.

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.913
Mm-hm.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.120
So, I'm seeing this, right?

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:28.240
The shadow's moving. It looks like
there's somebody else there, right?

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.080
Yeah, but...
But...

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:31.560
...you know.
But... But what?

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.200
Cara, this is... Come on, this is Dad.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.240
He's doing what he always does.
He's messing with you.

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.231
Can you just find out what it is?

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.953
Yeah, sure.

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:45.320
So, uh...

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.753
What's the deal?

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:52.600
The deal, Mr Saber,
is a body found at your house.

01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:54.520
Excuse me?

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:58.149
Male. Approximately 30-50 years of age.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.078
You know him?

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.153
OK.

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.711
Are you a religious man, Mr Saber?

01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:15.040
I only ask as this cross
was etched into the victim's back.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:18.353
Do you recognise this?

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:23.474
Maybe it was burnt
or carved in, we're not sure yet.

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.240
Does this mean anything to you?

01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:31.800
No.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.519
Adam, do you recognise any of these?

01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:39.800
Do you recognise them?

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.640
Does this cross mean anything to you?

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.240
Do you recognise any of these?

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.360
I said, "I don't recognise them!"
Are you deaf?!

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:51.160
OK. Excuse me. Excuse me, Detective.

01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:52.878
Can I speak to you for a second?

01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.394
Don't push him on this right now.
You 're not gonna get anywhere.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:04.760
And I... I think I can help you
with that cross.

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.240
I've seen it somewhere before.

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.912
Yeah.

01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:15.600
I saw markings like this in town.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.955
I'm sorry. I didn't know who else to ask.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.151
Dr Jessup, why are you here?

01:07:27.560 --> 01:07:29.994
Your textbooks have failed you,
isn't that right?

01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.360
Yes.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.920
So listen.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:37.515
That's why God gave us two ears
but one mouth.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:43.520
There's the Devil's magic in these hills,

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.160
that some may try to tend an ailing child

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:50.400
or take revenge for a terrible wrongdoing.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.520
Remember this.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:57.071
Your books may have failed you,
but your God has not.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:03.350
Follow on where the road ends
to the very top of the valley.

01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.589
You 'll see a Holler there.
Ask for the Granny.

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:43.756
Excuse me?

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.111
I... I'm looking for the Granny.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:02.870
It's important that I find her.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:25.240
I need... I need to...
I need to find out what this is.

01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:27.640
I-I think it's some kind of a cross.

01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:30.631
Do you know what it is?

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:33.718
Do you... Do you know?

01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:42.069
Let me see.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:58.592
It's no cross.

01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:06.754
How are you doing that?

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.480
With better eyes than yours.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:15.360
Can you tell me what it means?

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:18.830
You won't believe. Child!

01:11:04.160 --> 01:11:05.640
What the hell is that?

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.360
Want a soda?
Mm-mm.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:19.510
You sure?
Mm-hm.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.320
No way. No freaking way.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.000
Ow! What are you doing?

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.120
Sorry, pal.

01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.840
I need to try something.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.920
Uncle Stephen.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:07.309
What are you doing?
I gotta check something.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.595
Arggh!

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.640
Hold him down. Hold him down!

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.993
Keep still!

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.800
He'll be fine.

01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:39.229
Now will you believe?

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.678
It's the writing of the mountains.

01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:57.952
This... is shelter.

01:15:20.800 --> 01:15:23.360
You have two new messages.

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:26.800
Dr Jessup,
this is Detective Danton.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.560
Just wanted to let you know
there wasn't enough to hold Adam Saber

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.760
but we released him
into your father's care.

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.320
Any luck with that cross? Call me.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.800
Next message.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:39.400
Jesus, Carrie,
where the hell are you?

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.840
OK, the darkness on the video,
the thing that moves...

01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:45.560
...it's a sound wave.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.040
It's a voice.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.440
Carrie, it's a fricking voice. Listen.

01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.919
Reverend Christian Moore...

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.991
...shelter now the faithless!

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.760
Hear that?

01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:11.160
Cara.
What was that?

01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:17.480
Uh, I have no idea. But I do know
who Christian Moore is. Or was.

01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:23.240
He was born in Burlington,
Alabama, in 1889.

01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:25.360
He's one of those good ol' boys,

01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:26.840
southern faith healers.

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:31.800
He died in... 1918.
That's all the info I got.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:33.480
However, listen to this. OK.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:38.120
There's some sort of historical society
in Milling Junction.

01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.200
Now, there's a guy there
by the name of Monty.

01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:41.960
He has all this information on him.

01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:45.240
OK, I'm-I'm... I'm about 50 miles
from Milling Junction now.

01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:46.880
You can be there in an hour. Go.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:01.520
You alright?
My throat scratches.

01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.440
Let me see what I got.
No cough medicines.

01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:06.760
Mom says it's not good for you.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.240
Seriously?
Honey works though.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:11.878
Yeah? OK.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:27.080
Uncle Stephen.
Yeah?

01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:30.629
I think there's something on my back.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:38.720
Well, my late father
made these films

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:41.075
right after the Great War.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:53.040
1918.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.960
That's when it came.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.635
The influenza epidemic.

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.840
And that's when we met him.

01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:06.560
The Reverend Christian Moore.

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:09.760
He was a self-proclaimed faith healer

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:13.000
and he told the Holler folks that

01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:15.160
they didn't need their voodoo medicine.

01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.400
Just faith in the Lord.

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.960
And he had a good number of Holler folk

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.032
turn their backs on the Granny.

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.640
You see, he used, as an example,
his own two children.

01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:36.040
They were full of health
and apparently immune

01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:38.720
to the ravages of the disease.

01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:45.160
And they were strange children,
as I remember. Quiet.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.550
Turns out that their silence
was for a good reason.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.080
The Reverend had lost his faith

01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:58.760
and he had had his own kin inoculated
against the disease,

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.200
leaving the others to die.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.838
That's awful.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:10.880
And that's why the Holler folk
did what they did.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.155
What was that?

01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:20.840
My father was filming as usual
and I accompanied him.

01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:33.312
And that's when I found them -
the Reverend's children.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.637
They dragged the Reverend
to the Granny.

01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:08.960
And she handed down
her own form of mountain justice

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:11.872
for his faithless ways.

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.709
And I can't really tell you
what happened...

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.997
...but to a child of eight...

01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:36.800
...it sure as hell looked like that old hag

01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:40.236
had sucked out Christian Moore's soul...

01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:54.840
...and stuffed his gullet with dirt
so that it couldn't get back in.

01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:00.198
And then she said something
that I... I'll never forget.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:07.400
Reverend Christian Moore,

01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:13.794
shelter now the faithless.

01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.233
Excuse me.

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:26.160
Hello.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.160
Doctor Jessup, it's Detective Danton.
Can you hear me?

01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:31.080
Yeah. What... Wh-what's the matter?

01:21:31.080 --> 01:21:32.560
I just wanna let you know

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:34.600
we've dispatched a squad car
to your father's location.

01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:37.000
They'll be there in a few minutes.
I'm on my way now.

01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.800
Why?! Why? What's happened?!

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.280
There's been a mistake.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:47.720
Hello?

01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:49.800
Dad?
Oh, hey, sweetie.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.440
Dad, is Adam with you now?

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:56.240
Yes. The police
dropped him off a while ago.

01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.520
Can he hear what I'm saying?

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.400
I shouldn't think so. He's in his room.

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:04.480
OK, um, Dad, I need you to leave.
Why? What's going on?

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.960
You 're in danger.
What are you talking about?

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.720
Dad, Adam Saber is dead.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.200
Can you hear me?

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.880
Yes, but you 're not making any sense.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:21.240
The body that I found - that was Adam.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.960
Whoever's with you now
is not Adam Saber.

01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:26.880
Well, then, who is he?

01:22:26.880 --> 01:22:28.677
I don't know who he...

01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:33.080
Oh, my God.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.835
Dad...

01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:58.120
Dad... Dad!

01:23:01.040 --> 01:23:03.395
Dad, can you hear me?

01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:09.155
Can you hear me?

01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400
Dad?

01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.160
Dad, w...

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:18.440
Da...

01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:21.000
Dad...

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:21.955
No...

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:32.478
Just pick up, please.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:41.360
Latham Institute.

01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:44.000
Virgil, I need you to run upstairs
and check on my dad, OK?

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.594
OK. I'll check on him. I'll put you on hold.

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.560
Dr Harding? Shit. Shit.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.394
No! Jesus Christ!

01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.952
Dr... Dr Harding...

01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.440
Cara... Cara... Cara, you...

01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:39.560
Virgil, where... where's my dad?

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.520
Something terrible's happened, Cara. I...

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:44.240
He's gone.

01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.120
He's dead.
What?

01:24:47.120 --> 01:24:49.680
I couldn't...
There was nothing I could do.

01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.880
He's gone.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.359
Wh... Wha...

01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.320
Wh... What?

01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:01.359
I'm so sorry, Cara. So sorry...

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.120
Hello?
Hi, sweetie. It's Mommy.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.760
Can you... Can you...
Can you put your uncle on?

01:25:46.760 --> 01:25:49.160
Mom wants to talk to you.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:52.560
He's getting his car keys.
Wh-why? Where are you going?

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:54.040
Come on. Come on.

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.520
Sammy, are you alright?

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.600
Hey. Sammy's coughing up a storm.
She's got some rash on her back.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:25:59.600
Her paediatrician's closed.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.480
They said I should start
heading to General.

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.633
Cara?

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.160
Cara?

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.080
Are you there?

01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:18.080
A doctor can't help her.

01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:22.840
Are you out of your mind, Cara?
She needs to see a doctor.

01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:24.680
Think about what you heard
on that video.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.120
This man is so dangerous.
Please, you have to bring her up here.

01:26:28.120 --> 01:26:29.600
No, you have to listen to yourself.

01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.600
I'm not taking my niece
to a goddamn witchdoctor.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.080
I'm taking her to a hospital.

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.200
Please listen to me and bring her here.

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.760
No!
Where are we going?

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.240
To the hospital. You 're gonna be fine.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.880
Stevo! Wait.

01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:44.360
Stay the hell away from us.

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.960
Stevo! You have no idea
what's going on here, Stevie.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.840
Samantha Jane! Come with me!
Samantha Jane!

01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:51.239
Go, go, go, go! Up the stairs.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.354
Come on. In the bathroom.
In the bathroom. Go, go, go.

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.360
You 're in great danger, buckaroo.

01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.840
Hey. Your freak show just showed up
in Dad's car.

01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:05.760
Keep him away from her, OK?

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:08.400
Stephen, for once in your life,
will you listen to your father?!

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.560
Here.
Hi, Mommy.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:13.760
Hey, baby. Hey, do whatever
your Uncle Stephen says, OK?

01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:14.760
OK.

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:16.240
Now, everything's gonna be OK

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:19.120
and I'm gonna stay on the phone
with you the whole time, alright?

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.000
I'm scared, Mommy.
I know. I know.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.080
The man from the soccer field -
he's here.

01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:27.071
I know, honey. I know. I know.

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:41.440
Stevo!

01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:43.960
He's coming up the stairs.

01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.000
He's in the house.

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:48.514
Stephen?

01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.560
Samantha Jane!

01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.760
Stephen, this is your father.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.880
This is no time to be playing games,
Stephen.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.233
Shh...

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.389
Sammy?

01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:06.200
Samantha Jane, honey.

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:08.280
You gotta come with your grandpa,
Samantha Jane.

01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.157
Shh.
Honey?

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:15.760
Please! Damn it, Stevie, open the door!

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:18.040
We don't have much time!

01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:21.840
There's a very bad man coming, Stevie!

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.320
Open the door!

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.240
I can't help you if you don't
open the door to your father!

01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:28.680
I don't care, man!
Get out of this house now!

01:28:28.680 --> 01:28:31.760
Stevie! Stevie!

01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:34.360
Stevie!
Ugh!

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.720
Sammy!

01:28:35.720 --> 01:28:37.640
Arrgh!

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:54.640
Samantha Jane...

01:28:54.640 --> 01:28:57.240
Sammy! Sammy! Stephen?

01:28:57.240 --> 01:29:00.800
That was an accident, honey.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:02.800
Listen to me.

01:29:02.800 --> 01:29:06.280
You gotta come with me,
Samantha Jane.

01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.200
Sammy, tell him
to put David on the phone.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.480
She wants to speak to David.

01:29:11.480 --> 01:29:16.000
David? David's not here, sweetie.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.195
Sammy, put me...
Put me on speaker phone.

01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.756
Caroline?

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.996
Put David on the fucking phone now!

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:35.000
Sammy? Sam... Stephen? Stephen?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.752
Mommy...

01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:39.480
...he fell.

01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:42.760
Sammy?
Can you come here and get me?

01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:48.551
Before he wakes up. Uncle Stephen?

01:29:52.560 --> 01:29:54.118
Are you OK?

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.759
Tell me where this witchdoctor is.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:05.080
Come on. You 're fine.
I'm scared!

01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.560
Don't be scared.

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.720
Buckle up.

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:11.714
Come on!

01:30:30.720 --> 01:30:33.440
When I cough, it feels like
I wanna throw up, Uncle Stephen.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.680
We're gonna see your mom
real soon, OK?

01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:38.240
I promise.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.033
Hey! Hey!

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.480
Mommy!
I'll carry you, baby.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:05.400
Give me your hands. It's OK.

01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:07.640
Oh, my God. Come on.

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.360
Ow! Ow, Mommy!

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:12.511
Let me see.

01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:20.320
OK. Drive, Stephen.
Drive straight ahead.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.960
How much further?
It's just a couple more miles.

01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:32.960
We're in the middle of nowhere.
I know. I know.

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:34.440
Just go straight. We'll be there soon.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:36.040
Jesus, I hope you know
what you 're doing.

01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:37.473
Just keep going straight!

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.635
Watch out!
Shit!

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.760
Oh, God! Oh, good.
What the hell is that?

01:31:46.760 --> 01:31:48.720
It's alright. It's alright.

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:50.551
We're here. It's alright.

01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:56.800
You stay here. Stay right here, Stephen.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:59.240
Come on, honey. Come on.

01:31:59.240 --> 01:32:03.720
Oh, it's OK. You 're alright.
I know, I know. It's OK.

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.316
Oh, f... Fu...

01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:18.960
Shit.

01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:22.080
Ah, come on.

01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:24.600
Arrgh! Arrgh!

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:43.000
Mom, I don't want to...
No. It's alright. It's OK.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.880
Just show her your back.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.360
She looks scary.
Show her your back.

01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:49.080
She's gonna help you. It's OK.
I'm gonna be right here.

01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.400
Do I have to?
I'm gonna be right here, OK?

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:17.713
Lost your way, did you, child?

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.880
From God?

01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.235
My daddy died.

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:29.479
Terrible thing, to lose a loved one.

01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:35.077
Worse thing to lose your faith.

01:33:43.720 --> 01:33:46.000
I'm sorry, child.

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:47.480
Why?

01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:53.280
Once the sheltering has begun,
he will find you.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.400
No. No.

01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:56.160
No, no, you have to do something.

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.640
She's made her choice.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:00.280
She didn't make a choice.
She didn't make a choice. She's a child.

01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:03.360
We are all God's children.

01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:06.040
Please help us. Help... Help her.

01:34:06.040 --> 01:34:09.280
She will not be alone.

01:34:09.280 --> 01:34:11.960
She will rest with the sheltered ones.

01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:12.960
No. No!

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:20.153
Mommy!

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:48.111
Stephen! Stephen!

01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.720
Cover your eyes, OK?

01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.520
Don't look. Don't look. Don't.
OK.

01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:55.920
Stephen... Stephen?

01:34:55.920 --> 01:34:56.920
Stephen...

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:08.000
Don't... Keys... Keys...

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.840

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:14.875
Mom!
Come on.

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:31.320
Arggh!
Mommy!

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:32.275
Sammy...

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:59.954
OK. OK. Are you OK?

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.400
Alright, baby. OK. Come on.

01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:04.436
Come on. Come on.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:09.720
OK, I'm sorry. OK, sorry.

01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:11.836
It's OK. You 're OK. It's OK.

01:36:16.840 --> 01:36:18.432
Shh.

01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:53.320
Sammy? Sammy, what is it?

01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:58.920
Oh, my God. It's OK, baby.
Get it out. Get it out.

01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.200
Oh, my God. OK.

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:04.720
Mommy, I can't feel my fingers.
OK, baby. It's OK. You 're alright.

01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.240
It's gonna be alright.
You 're gonna be al...

01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:12.160
Ugh!

01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.960
Sammy!

01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:54.716
Mommy?

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:12.353
You 're bleeding, Mommy.

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.800
I hit my head.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:27.600
It's OK. It's OK.
I'm really scared, Mommy.

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:31.320
It's OK. It's OK. Shh... Shh...

01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:33.960
Shh. Come on. Come here. Come here.

01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:36.793
Come here. It's OK. It's OK.

01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:43.400
It's OK. It's alright. It's alright. It's OK.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:46.360
Shh...

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:50.480
OK, OK, OK, OK, OK.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:55.320
Shh... OK, OK. OK. OK.

01:38:55.320 --> 01:38:58.480
Alright. Alright. It's alright.

01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:08.120
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John

01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.960
Bless the bed that I lay on

01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:13.560
Bless me as I lay me down to sleep

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:16.199
I give myself to God to keep

01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.560
Five little angels round my bed

01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.120
One to the foot and one to the head

01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:28.069
One to sing and one to pray...

01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.640
...and one to take my sins away.

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:38.800
Amen.

01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:43.559
Mommy...

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:48.600
Mommy...

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:50.080
It's OK.

01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:57.957
Mommy!

01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:23.394
Arggh!

01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.269
Sammy.

01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:10.920
Sammy?

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:13.720
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:15.438
Breathe, Sammy.

01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:26.596
Oh, God.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:58.036
Sammy?
