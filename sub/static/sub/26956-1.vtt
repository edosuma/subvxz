<i>Rip-Fixes-Sync
by VaVooM</i>

00:43.251 --> 00:45.978
Good morning, Desmond.

00:46.013 --> 00:48.247
Darcy Fitzwilliam

00:48.282 --> 00:52.017
- every day, like clockwork.
- This is for you.

00:52.053 --> 00:54.953
Darcy, you shouldn't have.
Thank you.

00:54.989 --> 00:58.424
What are the odds there's

00:58.459 --> 01:01.026
a winning lottery ticket in here?

01:01.062 --> 01:03.195
You know, for tuition...

01:03.230 --> 01:06.365
- Wait, he got in?
- Early acceptance.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.701
My son's going to Stanford!
The first one in our family!

01:09.737 --> 01:11.970
That is such wonderful,
wonderful news!

01:12.006 --> 01:14.506
- You must be so proud.
- I'm gonna be working here...

01:14.542 --> 01:18.277
...'til I'm 106, but it's good,
it's good, you know.

01:18.312 --> 01:20.512
If only I could afford
your minimums, you know,

01:20.548 --> 01:22.714
and throw you some of my
money to invest for me.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.728
Hey, if you want to invest with us,
I'll take care of you.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.652
- Don't worry about our minimums.
- Really?

01:26.687 --> 01:29.521
Maybe me and my wife could have
something for our retirement.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.290
It's what I do.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.959
Alright. Well, just for that,
coffee is on the house today.

01:33.994 --> 01:36.795
Absolutely not.
I am paying.

01:36.831 --> 01:39.198
Your son is going to Stanford,
so exciting!

01:39.233 --> 01:42.000
Hey, merry Christmas! And we're
gonna talk when I get back.

01:42.036 --> 01:44.136
Yes, we will.
Thank you, Darcy. Merry Christmas!

01:51.712 --> 01:53.312
Let me know
if you have any questions

01:53.347 --> 01:55.025
about these financial statements.
Just call me.

01:55.049 --> 01:57.249
I won't be in the office
over the holidays,

01:57.284 --> 01:59.418
but I'm always available to you.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.588
I'll try and leave you alone
so that you can enjoy Christmas.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.590
You can wake me
from a deep sleep, Mark.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.725
I always have time for
my favourite client.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.095
I bet you say that
to all your accounts.

02:10.131 --> 02:11.964
Only when I mean it.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.950
I knew I made the right choice
going with you, Darcy.

02:13.951 --> 02:16.935
And I will make sure you never
regret it. Merry Christmas, Mark.

02:16.971 --> 02:19.538
Merry Christmas.

02:26.046 --> 02:28.303
OK, I've got all your
gifts organized.

02:28.716 --> 02:31.216
- Home, mailroom staff, accounting.
- Great.

02:31.252 --> 02:32.784
How did it go with Mark Spencer?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.554
- Good. He's happy.
- Of course he is.

02:35.589 --> 02:40.125
His portfolio has grown 22%
in 8 months thanks to you.

02:40.161 --> 02:42.127
So why do you look so unhappy?

02:42.163 --> 02:45.497
I'm not unhappy.
I'm very, very happy.

02:45.533 --> 02:47.733
And I'm very, very convinced.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.835
I'm fine, Erica.

02:49.870 --> 02:52.237
I'm just really looking forward
to the break.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.840
From work or from Carl?

02:54.875 --> 02:57.342
Both?

02:57.378 --> 03:00.512
My partners aren't exactly
thrilled with me right now,

03:00.548 --> 03:02.681
but I think as long as I can
keep Mark Spencer happy,

03:02.716 --> 03:04.550
they have nothing
to complain about.

03:04.585 --> 03:05.902
Exactly.

03:05.903 --> 03:08.287
So, I'm going to throw myself
into the holidays...

03:08.288 --> 03:10.422
...and not think about all this
for a minute.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.369
I think it's great that you're
going home for Christmas,

03:12.393 --> 03:14.927
instead of working through
the holidays like last year.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.645
No, I will be working.

03:16.646 --> 03:19.765
My mother is actually throwing
the Pemberley League holiday auction.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.650
The family who was supposed to do it,
they dropped out at the last minute,

03:22.674 --> 03:25.837
so we have to basically plan the equivalent
of a wedding in about seven days.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.806
That sounds... fun?

03:27.841 --> 03:32.678
Yeah, that's not the word I would use,
but it's just the distraction I need.

03:32.713 --> 03:37.849
- Car's here to take you to the airport.
- Great.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.235
You've got this.

03:39.236 --> 03:42.821
That's yet to be seen,
but let's keep hope alive.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.427
Merry Christmas.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.766
Off to Ohio?

03:54.802 --> 03:58.718
Yes, but I'm available by phone
if you or the other partners need me.

03:59.451 --> 04:02.708
I sent an e-mail with the projected
profit margins for the accounts,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.444
big and small, and the
numbers look great, Austin.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.179
Yeah, of course.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.881
I really think we can continue
to grow and expand even more

04:09.917 --> 04:12.184
if we just lower our
investment minimums.

04:12.219 --> 04:16.721
And then, there are those who say,
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it".

04:16.757 --> 04:18.724
You know,
when we started this firm,

04:18.759 --> 04:20.959
we agreed we'd always hear
each other out.

04:20.995 --> 04:23.095
And we will.
I hear you.

04:23.130 --> 04:26.265
But I don't want you to worry
about any of this now, Darcy.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.133
You just enjoy the holidays
with your family

04:28.168 --> 04:29.401
and I'll hold down the fort.

04:29.471 --> 04:32.904
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

04:40.180 --> 04:43.615
I'm on my way to the airport now.
I can't wait to see you.

04:43.651 --> 04:46.458
Yeah, actually, your father
arranged a pick-up for you

04:46.459 --> 04:49.666
because I have a meeting with the caterer,
and he's still gonna be at the office.

04:49.690 --> 04:50.907
Wait, who?

04:50.908 --> 04:54.155
We invited Carl to the auction
when you were still together,

04:54.190 --> 04:58.157
and then he and Dad arranged
meetings for this week, so...

04:58.192 --> 04:59.164
Mom, really?

04:59.199 --> 05:02.378
He still does work for the company,
honey, and he's a good man.

05:02.413 --> 05:03.402
I know he's a good man;

05:03.437 --> 05:05.504
I just don't know
if he's the man for me.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.706
I just need some time
to figure things out.

05:07.741 --> 05:09.641
It's only been a month.

05:09.677 --> 05:12.443
Well, anyway, you and I are
gonna be busy with the auction,

05:12.478 --> 05:14.648
and he and Dad are
gonna be busy at work.

05:16.717 --> 05:19.980
Listen, I'll just hire a car for you
if it's uncomfortable.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.434
No, it's fine.
Carl and I are still friends.

05:22.469 --> 05:26.491
- I just hope he realizes that's all it is.
- I'm sure he does.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.827
Have a safe flight.
I love you, darling.

05:28.862 --> 05:30.862
Bye, Mom.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.832
And the things you are trying
to get away from, follow you home.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.512
Thanks.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.550
- Carl!
- Hey.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.685
- Hey.
- Let me help you with that.

05:53.721 --> 05:56.254
No, I can get it.

05:56.290 --> 05:59.191
I know this is weird for you,
but your dad booked

05:59.226 --> 06:01.226
these meetings and
insisted I still come.

06:01.261 --> 06:03.395
What could I do?
He's... he's my boss.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.564
I know. Once he gets an idea
in his mind,

06:05.599 --> 06:07.466
it's hard to change it.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.901
Sounds like someone else I know.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.473
Listen, I...

06:14.508 --> 06:16.541
I didn't mean to hurt you, Carl.

06:16.577 --> 06:19.811
I know. And I take responsibility
for my part.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.948
We're both so busy,
and I wasn't always present.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.650
It's not just that, it's...
Everything in my life

06:25.686 --> 06:29.321
seems to work and yet
I still feel unsettled.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.668
I need some time to clear my
head and figure out what I want.

06:31.692 --> 06:34.393
- I get it. You need space.
- Yeah. I'm not saying never.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.729
Just not while my head
is so unclear.

06:37.765 --> 06:40.065
OK, but I really do believe
we're meant to be together.

06:51.011 --> 06:56.014
And this one is a turkey pot pie
with a whipped garlic mashed potato.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.129
It's a little spin
on a traditional Christmas dinner.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.421
I like to get creative
with the classics.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.289
You know,
I've thrown dozens of parties,

07:04.324 --> 07:06.792
so why is it that I've never heard
your name before, Luke?

07:06.827 --> 07:08.960
I'm actually new
to the catering scene.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.530
I just bought this place
three months ago, and so far,

07:11.565 --> 07:14.032
the only thing I've been able
to change is the menu.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.301
When my friend said that
I had to come for a tasting,

07:16.336 --> 07:18.937
I was skeptical, but already,

07:18.972 --> 07:21.273
this is so much more
than the previous place.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.275
I actually have plans
for a full rebrand.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.710
A new name.
Renovations.

07:25.746 --> 07:28.454
You won't be able to recognize
this place when I'm done with it.

07:28.489 --> 07:30.315
Man with a plan.

07:30.350 --> 07:35.257
So, the turkey pot pie on the menu
only for the holidays.

07:35.292 --> 07:38.408
It's the most delicious food
I've ever tasted.

07:38.409 --> 07:40.125
Good. Tell your friends.

07:42.362 --> 07:46.231
No.
I want to show my friends.

07:46.266 --> 07:50.569
I'd like to hire you to cater
the Pemberley League auction.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.338
My predecessor was gonna do
all the cooking herself,

07:53.373 --> 07:55.340
but then she had to back out,

07:55.375 --> 07:57.187
and now everybody's
all booked for the holidays.

07:57.211 --> 08:00.145
Then it's lucky for you that
no one knows that I exist yet.

08:01.949 --> 08:05.016
Why don't I come up with
a few additional menu items

08:05.052 --> 08:07.219
- and run them past you?
- Come by the house tomorrow?

08:07.254 --> 08:10.589
- Absolutely.
- OK.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.424
With this food,

08:12.459 --> 08:16.328
everybody is gonna know
your name by Christmas day.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.299
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

08:33.780 --> 08:37.381
- Darcy!
- You're here!

08:37.417 --> 08:39.417
I just got in five minutes ago.

08:39.453 --> 08:43.855
I'm sorry I didn't pick you up myself,
but the caterer went very quickly.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.391
A few samples, I was sold!

08:46.426 --> 08:48.260
Well, good, that's
one thing off our list.

08:50.664 --> 08:54.408
I'm just so happy to have you
finally home for Christmas.

08:54.443 --> 08:56.645
Mom, you talk like
it's been decades.

08:56.646 --> 08:59.604
I missed two Christmases, and
I just saw you last month in New York.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.640
Well, never enough for me.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.409
But anyway, you're here now
and not a moment too soon.

09:04.444 --> 09:07.779
We have so much to do, Darcy,
and so little time to do it.

09:07.814 --> 09:10.815
Well, let's have a cup of tea,
and we will make an action plan.

09:10.851 --> 09:13.084
OK. Let's go.

09:14.335 --> 09:17.180
So when Marian Beckwith
couldn't host it anymore,

09:17.181 --> 09:20.225
I couldn't just let it
be canceled.

09:20.260 --> 09:23.669
I mean, we haven't hosted
this in years,

09:23.698 --> 09:27.299
but this and Pemberley Carols
are the highlights of the season.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.646
It's been years since I've been
to Pemberley Carols.

09:29.670 --> 09:33.287
I can almost smell the roasted chestnuts
just thinking about it.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.132
Well, it's not for a few days,

09:35.133 --> 09:38.143
so if we can squeeze it in,
we'll go caroling in the square

09:38.178 --> 09:40.645
and you will get your chestnuts.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.198
That would be perfect.

09:42.199 --> 09:44.933
Anyway,
Marian was behind on everything,

09:44.968 --> 09:46.685
which has forced me
to play catch up

09:46.720 --> 09:50.255
and we are low
on big-ticket auction items,

09:50.290 --> 09:56.428
so this year, I'm going to do
something completely different.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.866
Wait, you're auctioning
Christmas trees?

10:01.902 --> 10:05.704
Custom Christmas Trees.
Aren't they exquisite?

10:05.739 --> 10:09.374
A charity in Kirkwood had one
and look at the money they raised.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.543
- Wait. Is that per tree?
- Yes!

10:11.578 --> 10:14.346
I've hired a top-notch
designer to create them,

10:14.381 --> 10:17.148
in record time no less, and
people are already intrigued.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.150
It feels... fresh.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.520
I like it even more. Fresh and
exciting is just what I need.

10:22.556 --> 10:26.558
Well, you have worked so hard
to build something incredible

10:26.593 --> 10:30.017
and I hope that this Christmas you can
just enjoy the fruits of your labour.

10:30.949 --> 10:32.297
Yeah.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.932
What's the matter, Darce?

10:35.902 --> 10:38.503
Nothing. I...

10:38.538 --> 10:41.206
Don't get me wrong, Mom,
I love my work; I just...

10:41.241 --> 10:44.109
I feel like
I'm missing something.

10:46.079 --> 10:48.980
Anyway, it's good I'm here now.

10:49.016 --> 10:51.216
Spending time with family.
Dinner with Caylee tonight.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.117
It's good.

10:52.118 --> 10:54.320
Well, know that I'm very proud
of you.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.922
And though your father doesn't
admit it often, he is too.

10:57.958 --> 11:01.192
But he would be more so
if I came back and worked for him.

11:01.228 --> 11:04.029
Well, I've asked him to lay off
the pressure this week.

11:04.064 --> 11:04.964
Thank you.

11:04.965 --> 11:08.185
If he hears I'm unsettled,
he'll just say, "I told you so".

11:08.186 --> 11:10.669
No, he won't say that, honey.

11:10.704 --> 11:14.539
He'll be thinking it,
he just won't say it out loud.

11:14.574 --> 11:16.408
He promised.

11:16.443 --> 11:19.144
Thanks, Mom.

11:21.982 --> 11:25.417
- Everyone decent in here?
- Caylee!

11:25.452 --> 11:27.686
- Hi!
- Hi!

11:27.721 --> 11:30.906
So, hurry up and finish
whatever it is you're doing!

11:30.907 --> 11:32.691
Just researching.

11:32.726 --> 11:35.894
Five tips to throwing
a super fundraiser.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.541
Well, the Internet will still be here
when we get back from dinner,

11:38.565 --> 11:41.533
So let's go! We have
so much catching up to do.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.702
I just talked to you
a few weeks ago.

11:43.737 --> 11:46.738
I have more to tell now.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.407
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew it was something,

11:49.443 --> 11:52.377
but...
the new man in my life,

11:52.412 --> 11:55.113
- Jim Bennett!
- Wait, Jim Bennett?

11:55.148 --> 11:58.917
How do I know that name?
Did he go to Pemberley High?

11:58.952 --> 12:01.753
Wait a second.
Is he Luke Bennett's brother?

12:01.788 --> 12:04.122
Yes, but please
don't hold that against him.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.807
What do you mean?

12:05.808 --> 12:10.261
Luke Bennett and I had a silly high
school rivalry, like two decades ago.

12:10.297 --> 12:11.864
You guys used to fight
all the time.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.940
We did not fight; we debated, which
is what you do on the debate team.

12:14.975 --> 12:17.206
On the stage, yes, but you
guys took it off the stage.

12:17.207 --> 12:20.939
- To the cafeteria, the hallways...
- OK, fine.

12:20.974 --> 12:23.675
But I'm sure we both have changed.
I mean, I know I have.

12:23.711 --> 12:26.578
Good. Because we're having
dinner with Jim tonight

12:26.613 --> 12:28.130
and Luke might be there.

12:28.656 --> 12:32.951
And by "might", I mean he will
because he owns the tavern now.

12:32.986 --> 12:36.654
Great! Yeah, no problem.

12:41.299 --> 12:44.929
Look at you, making a name for
yourself on the Pemberley party circuit.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.384
Still got a long way to go but
the place is half full tonight.

12:47.401 --> 12:48.790
Don't sell yourself short.

12:48.791 --> 12:51.803
It was always your dream, owning
a restaurant, and now you're doing it.

12:51.838 --> 12:53.138
Dad would be proud.

12:53.139 --> 12:56.107
Let's hold off on the celebration
until the vision is complete.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.943
Soon enough, little brother.
Soon enough. Hey!

12:59.669 --> 13:02.444
And I'm hoping you'll come to my
White Elephant party tomorrow night

13:02.479 --> 13:03.826
just for a little bit.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.162
Luke is letting me have it here,
because my place is so small.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.375
Yeah, of course, I'll come.

13:07.376 --> 13:10.355
I mean, you'll never have
enough pointless gifts in my life.

13:12.826 --> 13:15.460
- Luke Bennett.
- Darcy Fitzwilliam.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.497
OK, I'm gonna go sit with Jim.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.468
- My old sparring partner.
- Who are you calling old?

13:23.503 --> 13:26.905
Never you.
You look good.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.940
I heard that you got in today.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.419
Yeah. There's nothing like
Christmas in Pemberley, right?

13:30.454 --> 13:32.288
I'm surprised
to hear you say that.

13:32.323 --> 13:34.479
From my understanding,
you've missed the last few.

13:34.514 --> 13:36.592
And how would you know that?
Have you been checking up on me?

13:36.616 --> 13:38.928
People talk around here. It's
the information superhighway.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.319
Really? That's
interesting because I heard

13:41.354 --> 13:43.755
that you've actually been
in Cincinnati until recently.

13:43.790 --> 13:47.192
So now, who's doing the
checking up? I'm flattered.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.394
Yeah. No, don't be.
It was on the alumni website.

13:49.429 --> 13:52.551
Along with 300 other bios
and you remembered mine?

13:52.586 --> 13:54.866
I'm honoured
to be on your radar.

13:54.901 --> 13:59.770
The great and charmed Darcy Fitzwilliam
always destined for huge success.

13:59.845 --> 14:01.506
You say that almost
like it's a bad thing.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.042
No, I'm happy for you.
We should all be so lucky.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.495
Luck. Yeah, I mean, maybe
it's not so much luck;

14:07.496 --> 14:09.113
maybe it's, you know, hard work.

14:09.149 --> 14:10.915
A little luck on the side.

14:10.951 --> 14:14.252
I could say the same for you.
I mean, you own a restaurant.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.132
- That's not nothing.
- That is a double negative.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.189
You're still correcting me.
Really?

14:18.190 --> 14:21.426
After all these years,
you just can't help yourself?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.773
You know, really, I think
that you should be thanking me.

14:23.797 --> 14:26.598
I think I deserve a little bit
of credit for your success.

14:26.633 --> 14:30.501
- Really? Is that so?
- We challenged each other.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.137
That is why we went
all the way to state.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.306
OK, so see, all these
years later. I'm sorry,

14:35.342 --> 14:37.809
I didn't realize it was some
secret reverse psychology

14:37.844 --> 14:40.144
- you were using on me.
- Maybe I just knew a good team

14:40.180 --> 14:41.446
- when I saw one.
- OK.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.448
We'll get you guys some menus.

14:45.118 --> 14:48.186
I think it's safe to
say he hasn't changed.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.643
- Darcy.
- Hi, Dad.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.345
Hi.

15:14.381 --> 15:17.315
- How was your dinner with Caylee?
- It was good. It was nice.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.350
We... we had fun.

15:19.386 --> 15:21.619
I'm sorry I wasn't here
when you got in,

15:21.655 --> 15:24.722
but we'll have plenty of time
over the holidays to catch up.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.958
Your mother has saved
the Christmas tree

15:26.993 --> 15:29.027
so we can all decorate it
together.

15:29.062 --> 15:31.729
I am sure she did. It is
one of our best traditions.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.798
Your brother gets in
the day after tomorrow,

15:33.833 --> 15:36.234
so that's when we'll do it.
We're so thrilled

15:36.269 --> 15:38.136
to have everyone here
this year.

15:38.171 --> 15:42.707
Especially when your mother said
you were a little bit unsettled?

15:42.742 --> 15:45.209
Everything's fine, Dad.
I just needed a break.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.712
If you came back and worked
for me, you could have all...

15:47.747 --> 15:49.914
I think
you made a promise to Mom.

15:49.950 --> 15:52.483
- She mentioned that.
- Yeah.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.187
- Forewarned is forearmed, right?
- I will do

15:56.222 --> 16:00.058
my best, but I will never
apologize for wanting

16:00.093 --> 16:02.226
your incredible talent
at my company.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.395
That means a lot to
me, Dad, it really does,

16:04.431 --> 16:07.665
but... I needed to make it
on my own, and I feel

16:07.701 --> 16:10.234
- like there's more I can do.
- Like what?

16:11.738 --> 16:14.672
- I'm working on it.
- OK.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.741
Understood. I promise,

16:16.776 --> 16:18.910
I will not mention it again.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.346
- Until you do.
- I could slip.

16:23.383 --> 16:27.418
Good morning!

16:27.454 --> 16:29.687
OK, I have mapped it all out.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.723
We are going to have passed
hors d'oeuvres,

16:31.758 --> 16:33.491
and then we're gonna have
a dessert station

16:33.526 --> 16:35.960
right in front of the bay window
in the living room

16:35.996 --> 16:38.930
right by the silent-auction items.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.932
And I was thinking,

16:40.967 --> 16:42.900
what if we lined the perimeter
of the dining room

16:42.936 --> 16:45.436
with the trees
and had the auction there?

16:45.472 --> 16:47.905
Well, you have really thought
this through.

16:47.941 --> 16:50.241
I want to outraise
previous years.

16:50.276 --> 16:53.745
I hope we can. As I said,
Marian was behind on everything,

16:53.780 --> 16:56.948
including collecting donations
for the auction.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.195
I just hope those trees are
as great as the designer says

16:59.219 --> 17:02.086
- they're gonna be.
- Don't you worry, Mom!

17:02.122 --> 17:03.966
This year has the Fitzwilliam
name attached to it;

17:03.990 --> 17:06.457
I am going to make sure
it is the best year yet.

17:06.492 --> 17:09.493
That must be the caterer.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.430
Your father will let him in.
But come, and I'll introduce you

17:12.464 --> 17:14.343
because you're gonna be working
with him anyway.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.567
Great!

17:19.599 --> 17:23.247
Thank you for helping us
on such short notice.

17:24.715 --> 17:26.611
- Luke?!
- Darcy!

17:28.214 --> 17:30.114
You two know each other?

17:30.150 --> 17:32.150
We went to high school together.

17:32.185 --> 17:33.782
We were both
on the debate team.

17:34.654 --> 17:39.123
That's right! I'm so sorry for not
making the connection yesterday.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.783
Well, this is perfect because you two
already know how to work well together.

17:43.697 --> 17:47.231
- You did take that state championship.
- Yeah.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.700
Darcy and I always
did make a great team.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.969
Yeah.

17:55.891 --> 17:58.452
OK, so I have put together
a few different menus for you,

17:58.453 --> 18:02.013
but it depends on which direction
you're gonna be going with your theme.

18:02.048 --> 18:04.248
Well, we're benefiting
the Pemberley Youth Center

18:04.284 --> 18:06.250
so we're calling it
"A Season for Giving".

18:06.286 --> 18:09.887
Yeah, I guess that works.
Let me show you what I had in mind.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.356
This whole place becomes
a Winter Wonderland.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.492
We remove all the furniture.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.260
Food table goes here
right by the window

18:16.296 --> 18:18.529
with a presentation
to go along with the motif.

18:18.565 --> 18:20.932
That's actually where
I'm putting the dessert table.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.267
OK.
Just hear me out for a second.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.271
The guests, they mingle here
by the roaring fire.

18:25.272 --> 18:28.039
We give it a nice,
inclusive living room feel,

18:28.074 --> 18:30.608
and the food
has a contemporary twist.

18:30.643 --> 18:32.710
"Pancetta-wrapped beef tenderloin

18:32.745 --> 18:35.279
"with horseradish cream,
honey-roasted figs,

18:35.315 --> 18:37.015
yule log with cognac glaze".

18:37.050 --> 18:39.450
Luke, you've done a lot
for one day.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.886
I want it to be more than just food,
Mrs. Fitzwilliam,

18:41.921 --> 18:44.288
- I want it to be an experience.
- Please, call me Gloria.

18:44.324 --> 18:49.894
Mrs. Fitzwilliam is my mother-in-law's name,
and she hates sharing that title.

18:49.929 --> 18:51.496
Will do.

18:51.497 --> 18:55.967
This is all very innovative Luke,
and I love the Winter Wonderland feel.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.436
It's warm and cozy.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.915
Yeah, but the theme is
"A Season for Giving".

18:59.939 --> 19:02.206
Inside a Winter Wonderland.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.153
Right, but I've actually
already mapped this out.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.278
The decorations, the tables,
the silent-auction area...

19:07.313 --> 19:10.419
So, you can meld the two together.
Your ideas and Luke's.

19:11.496 --> 19:14.367
In fact, Luke, we could really use
someone with your instincts

19:14.422 --> 19:17.722
- to help Darcy execute the whole event.
- Mom, I really don't...

19:17.757 --> 19:18.642
I don't think that's...

19:18.643 --> 19:20.688
In the past,
I always had an event planner,

19:20.723 --> 19:24.896
but at the 11th hour, no one was available,
and we are on such a time crunch.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.098
- I appreciate that...
- You know, people who come

19:27.133 --> 19:31.502
to this fundraiser throw parties,
lots of parties.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.838
This could be the best publicity
you could ever wish for.

19:33.873 --> 19:37.684
And, darling, I know you like
to do things your way,

19:37.719 --> 19:40.578
but just accept the help.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.781
You two handle your end;
I'll find more auction items,

19:43.816 --> 19:46.417
and together, we just
might pull this off.

19:46.452 --> 19:49.754
Alright, well, I guess
we better get shopping.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.289
For my theme.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.825
- Actually, it's our collective theme.
- Sure, why not?

19:56.896 --> 19:59.830
Look, they're setting
up for Pemberley Carols.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.800
It's so nice.
I hope we can come.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.436
But four days though,
there's just so much to do.

20:08.241 --> 20:09.491
And it's my mom.

20:09.492 --> 20:12.188
OK, she needs me to pick up an auction
item at the gift store down here.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.312
And I need
to get on my supply order

20:14.347 --> 20:16.314
and call the service
to hire extra wait staff

20:16.349 --> 20:18.516
since your mother
loved my idea so much.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.885
Well, you are just gonna keep
reminding me...

20:20.920 --> 20:23.120
- ...of that forever, aren't you?
- Probably, yeah.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.656
Listen, have you ever catered
an event before?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.959
Yeah, I cater a restaurant
full of people every day.

20:27.994 --> 20:28.961
It's not the same thing.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.929
Have you ever thrown
a charity event before?

20:30.930 --> 20:34.148
No, but my family has,
and I've always helped out.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.268
It's not the same thing.
We're both rookies here.

20:36.303 --> 20:38.704
I'm not a rookie because I've
thrown other types of parties.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.704
I fed other types of people.
I think I'm up to the task.

20:41.739 --> 20:44.388
OK. Well, good because this
party has to be a success...

20:44.477 --> 20:46.978
- ...and I don't do anything halfway.
- Good. Neither do I.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.879
OK, good.
Then, we're in agreement.

20:48.915 --> 20:52.383
Good! I...
have nothing else to say.

20:52.418 --> 20:54.352
Good!

20:54.387 --> 20:56.354
I'll be right back.

21:10.803 --> 21:14.005
Hi! I'm Darcy Fitzwilliam.
I'm here to pick up a donation

21:14.040 --> 21:15.718
for the Pemberley League's
holiday auction.

21:15.742 --> 21:16.942
Are you Charlene Johanson?

21:16.943 --> 21:18.995
Yes. Of course.
I have it right over here.

21:18.996 --> 21:22.847
Great! Your store is
so beautifully decorated.

21:22.882 --> 21:25.249
That Christmas tree in the window
is just amazing!

21:25.285 --> 21:27.752
Thank you. I'm trying
to build up my clientele.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.954
I do interior design
on the side,

21:29.989 --> 21:35.593
and this place at Christmas tends
to be a good conversation starter.

21:36.252 --> 21:38.486
I'm sorry. It's not much,
I wish I could do more.

21:38.521 --> 21:40.197
This is beautiful.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.047
Really, we appreciate
your donation so much.

21:42.068 --> 21:45.202
- I'll make sure you're properly credited.
- Anything for Pemberley League.

21:45.238 --> 21:48.506
Merry Christmas.

21:49.909 --> 21:53.245
OK. I have the silent-auction item,
and I think we're good on decorations.

21:53.246 --> 21:57.048
OK, well,
I can take you home,

21:57.083 --> 21:58.994
but then I have to get back
to the restaurant to start to prep

21:59.018 --> 21:59.851
for Caylee's party.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.224
So you will have
to start decorating alone.

22:02.259 --> 22:03.921
Well, you know what they say,

22:03.956 --> 22:06.257
"If you want something done right,
do it yourself".

22:06.292 --> 22:08.172
Unless you're racing on a bicycle
built for two.

22:08.380 --> 22:09.546
Darcy!

22:11.097 --> 22:12.264
Carl! Hi!

22:12.265 --> 22:14.683
I was actually gonna meet
your dad up the street.

22:14.684 --> 22:18.102
Did you see that 4J Medical
closed at $25 a share?

22:18.137 --> 22:19.571
I did. It practically doubled.

22:19.572 --> 22:22.257
- That's a good call, Darcy,
putting clients in that one.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.342
Sometimes, an instinct pays off.

22:26.646 --> 22:29.013
It's stocks.
Boring business stuff.

22:29.048 --> 22:32.149
Sorry. Carl Downs,
this is Luke Bennett. He's our...

22:32.185 --> 22:33.718
We're old friends.

22:33.719 --> 22:36.420
We're old friends, and he's
actually catering the auction.

22:36.421 --> 22:38.022
I see.

22:38.042 --> 22:39.983
And Carl works for my dad,

22:39.984 --> 22:41.973
and he actually heads up
our New York office

22:41.974 --> 22:44.562
since my dad is mostly here
in Pemberley.

22:46.165 --> 22:50.101
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah. You too.

22:50.136 --> 22:53.637
- I guess I'll see you soon.
- Yeah, see you soon.

22:59.412 --> 23:01.545
So what was that about?

23:01.581 --> 23:03.748
It's a long story.

23:14.493 --> 23:18.329
So if we can just keep
the momentum going. Hi, honey!

23:18.364 --> 23:21.098
- Hey!
- That is gonna be so beautiful.

23:21.837 --> 23:24.402
But why don't you save
the decorating for later...

23:24.437 --> 23:25.642
...since you have Caylee's party.

23:25.643 --> 23:27.158
I was just getting a head start.

23:27.159 --> 23:30.374
I mean, it is no easy task making
this place a Winter Wonderland.

23:30.410 --> 23:32.254
We can do the Christmas tree
tomorrow night...

23:32.278 --> 23:34.256
- ...when your brother gets here.
- We'll get it done.

23:34.280 --> 23:36.580
Go have fun with your friends.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.686
Hey, Erica, you're there late.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.623
Darcy, something very weird
is going on around here.

23:45.658 --> 23:46.791
What do you mean?

23:46.792 --> 23:49.059
Partners' meeting
tomorrow afternoon.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.295
I don't know anything about
a partners' meeting.

23:51.296 --> 23:53.531
I think that's the point.

23:55.268 --> 23:57.902
Well, I wasn't invited.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.921
I overheard Austin's assistant
talking about it in the break room.

24:00.956 --> 24:03.073
You're definitely not invited.

24:03.109 --> 24:06.771
Well, I imagine I will be the topic
of conversation at this meeting.

24:06.806 --> 24:08.312
So what are we gonna do?

24:08.347 --> 24:10.414
Listen, don't tell anyone
I know about it

24:10.450 --> 24:12.716
and patch me in
via videoconference.

24:12.752 --> 24:14.752
An ambush, I love it.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.254
No, it's not an ambush,
but we're partners.

24:17.290 --> 24:19.090
If they have something
they want to say to me,

24:19.125 --> 24:21.192
they should say it to my face.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.763
Darce, everything alright?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.598
Yeah.

24:27.633 --> 24:30.634
- Yeah, no, it's... it's all good.
- Well, OK.

24:30.670 --> 24:33.170
I'm here if you need me.

24:33.206 --> 24:35.473
- Thanks, Dad.
- Have a good time tonight?

24:35.508 --> 24:37.441
Goodnight, Dad.

24:48.433 --> 24:49.487
<i>Alright, alright!</i>

24:49.522 --> 24:53.023
Who is White Elephant number 9?

24:53.059 --> 24:54.275
That's me.

24:54.276 --> 24:58.762
Darcy, come on up and choose
a present under the tree.

24:58.798 --> 25:02.318
Or if you like, you can steal
one of these already-opened gifts.

25:02.319 --> 25:08.439
We have the cross-eyed owl
or the talking golf putter.

25:08.474 --> 25:12.977
Well, as wonderful as those seem,
I am gonna choose a new one.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.179
And I choose this.

25:18.957 --> 25:20.317
Darce, you know the rules.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.720
If it's wearable,
you have to put it on.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.793
Yes! Alright, you guys,
let's take a little break.

25:29.794 --> 25:32.462
We have to try some of
Luke's amazing appetizers.

25:32.463 --> 25:34.959
- If you haven't tasted them already...
- It is the rules.

25:35.234 --> 25:39.036
Well, this is just... I mean,
it's everything I ever wanted.

25:39.071 --> 25:41.950
What are the rules as far as how
long we have to keep this stuff on?

25:41.985 --> 25:44.664
I don't know, but I'm guessing
it's at least January 1st.

25:44.665 --> 25:45.743
What?!

25:45.778 --> 25:49.513
No way, it's not fair 'cause
yours looks really great.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.682
- Yeah.
- Listen, don't tell anybody,

25:51.717 --> 25:54.351
but the second I get to my car,
I'm taking this off.

25:54.387 --> 25:56.237
Are you leaving?

25:56.238 --> 25:58.713
I mean, not right this second,
but soon, yeah.

25:58.748 --> 26:00.324
We have
to start so early tomorrow.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.326
We're already behind
as it is, and...

26:02.361 --> 26:04.328
...there's just so much weighing
on this.

26:04.810 --> 26:06.205
You OK?

26:06.895 --> 26:08.058
Fine.

26:09.201 --> 26:12.870
I just... There's some stuff
going on at the office.

26:12.905 --> 26:15.172
It's nothing major.

26:15.207 --> 26:19.816
Do you want to talk about it?
I'm actually a pretty good listener.

26:19.851 --> 26:21.786
Please!
Are you kidding me?

26:21.821 --> 26:24.515
You listen just enough
to take the contrary position.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.116
You take the pro, I'm the con.

26:26.152 --> 26:29.086
I don't know if you'd want
to call yourself a con.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.522
Noted. Look, Darcy,

26:31.557 --> 26:33.302
over the next few days,
we're in this together.

26:33.326 --> 26:36.745
You're gonna let me in eventually,
so why all the mystery?

26:36.746 --> 26:38.144
There's no mystery.

26:38.664 --> 26:40.047
What you see is what you get.

26:40.048 --> 26:42.542
I am not buying this
everything's fine routine.

26:42.543 --> 26:47.037
Stuff that's going on with your company,
the guy who works for your dad...

26:47.073 --> 26:48.605
Maybe I could help.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.875
I don't need help.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.559
Sorry. You first.

27:08.594 --> 27:10.728
- No. You first.
- I insist.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.796
- I insist more.
- You have a job to do.

27:12.832 --> 27:14.696
Customer goes first.

27:15.699 --> 27:17.663
One of us needs to step away
pretty quick here.

27:17.698 --> 27:18.802
Why?

27:21.806 --> 27:24.877
Are you kidding me? Really?
You put mistletoe in the doorway?

27:24.912 --> 27:26.610
What? It's tradition.

27:26.646 --> 27:31.515
It was started by ancient civilizations
who believed it warded off evil spirits.

27:31.550 --> 27:34.918
- I also think it's poisonous.
- Please, it's mistletoe!

27:34.954 --> 27:39.189
It's... You know, it hangs there,
people kiss... Christmas.

27:40.227 --> 27:41.803
Are you telling me
you don't actually know

27:41.827 --> 27:44.028
the significance of a kiss
under the mistletoe?

27:44.063 --> 27:47.798
Is the great Luke Bennett
losing his touch?

27:47.833 --> 27:50.100
No.
I'm just a little unprepared,

27:50.136 --> 27:52.269
but I'll research it
and I'll get back to you.

27:52.304 --> 27:56.974
Although, I do think that we should
probably honour its tradition.

27:59.679 --> 28:01.745
Don't hold your breath.

28:09.922 --> 28:11.238
<i>Well, I got some pushback.</i>

28:11.239 --> 28:14.291
And I said, "Either I'm taking
Christmas week off to be with my family

28:14.326 --> 28:16.360
or I'm finding another hospital".

28:17.407 --> 28:19.001
It's been madness.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.498
He's working in the ER, what?
Three, four nights a week?

28:21.534 --> 28:23.400
He gets home
when I'm leaving for work.

28:23.436 --> 28:26.403
Like two ships passing
in the morning.

28:26.439 --> 28:27.454
Well, I said to Dad,

28:27.455 --> 28:31.008
"We are waiting till everyone is
here before we decorate the tree".

28:31.043 --> 28:32.460
We'll do it tonight.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.964
I can't think of anything
more wonderful

28:34.999 --> 28:37.514
than having my whole family
here at Christmas.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.984
I second that.

28:40.456 --> 28:42.584
Can't believe I'm actually
seeing you in person.

28:44.056 --> 28:47.157
- You've grown!
- What are you talking about?

28:47.193 --> 28:48.859
We FaceTime every other day.

28:48.894 --> 28:51.395
Yeah, I know. I'm just happy
to see you unpixelated.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.997
I can't believe no one woke me
when you guys got here.

28:54.033 --> 28:56.166
- This feels complete now.
- Yes.

28:56.202 --> 29:00.170
And at last, there were six.

29:00.206 --> 29:03.040
No, we're just... we're just five.
Carl and I broke up.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.075
He's still in town, but...

29:05.111 --> 29:07.511
...we are just five.

29:07.546 --> 29:11.381
We're not talking about Carl.
We're six now.

29:11.417 --> 29:14.518
Or at least we'll be in June.

29:15.823 --> 29:20.236
- This is cheerful news!
- What a blessing!

29:21.060 --> 29:24.361
I don't know what we're gonna do
with our schedules, but...

29:24.396 --> 29:26.730
- We're gonna make it work.
- Yes!

29:26.766 --> 29:29.363
- I'm so happy!
- Get something for us to toast with.

29:29.398 --> 29:30.701
Cocoa will be nice,
I'll help.

29:30.736 --> 29:32.414
And I'm gonna go upstairs
and freshen up.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.786
That red-eye was brutal, so...

29:37.576 --> 29:39.576
- I can't believe this!
- Yeah.

29:39.612 --> 29:42.813
Oh, my gosh! The best news.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.815
- Yeah.
- I can't believe it.

29:44.850 --> 29:46.250
First, you get promoted
to attending position,

29:46.251 --> 29:49.486
- ...and now you're gonna be a dad.
- Yeah.

29:49.522 --> 29:52.446
- So happy for you, Parker.
- I'm happy for you too, Darce.

29:52.447 --> 29:55.159
We're both making it happen and
getting everything we always wanted.

29:58.829 --> 30:00.132
What's wrong?

30:00.167 --> 30:01.269
Nothing.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.393
Darcy...

30:04.470 --> 30:07.805
I just...
I mean, I look at your life...

30:07.840 --> 30:10.674
and it is so beautiful
and complete and...

30:10.709 --> 30:13.277
and I look at my life,
and, I don't know,

30:13.312 --> 30:16.892
- is this what I'm working toward?
- And what about Carl?

30:16.949 --> 30:20.684
It just wasn't progressing.
Nothing seems to be...

30:20.919 --> 30:23.787
I don't know, just being home
and seeing everyone so settled,

30:23.823 --> 30:26.423
it's just kind of shined a light
on all that, you know?

30:26.458 --> 30:28.458
Is Dad putting pressure
on you to come back?

30:28.494 --> 30:30.594
He's...
on his best behaviour,

30:30.629 --> 30:33.476
but I know he's secretly hoping
I'm gonna take over after he retires.

30:33.511 --> 30:35.999
I can tell,
he has the worst poker face.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.702
Yeah, but you're still digging
in your heels like you do.

30:38.737 --> 30:40.704
Well, you know,
can't help myself.

30:40.739 --> 30:43.907
I don't know, maybe the problem
is I'll never be satisfied.

30:45.477 --> 30:49.746
And maybe you're looking for
satisfaction in all the wrong places.

30:57.100 --> 30:58.864
Are you serious?

30:59.091 --> 31:01.617
So I don't understand why you would
take this on in the first place.

31:01.641 --> 31:03.927
This is completely unacceptable.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.897
- Hey, what's going on?
- The designer for the trees,

31:06.932 --> 31:08.932
- ...she's out.
- What? Why?

31:08.968 --> 31:10.934
She must have obviously
overbooked herself,

31:10.970 --> 31:13.103
and she's probably
a terrible businesswoman.

31:13.138 --> 31:15.405
OK, what are we gonna do?
If we want to make money,

31:15.441 --> 31:17.407
- we need a professional.
- I know!

31:17.443 --> 31:20.083
I've got other people I can call,
but this close to the holidays...

31:20.113 --> 31:22.097
Let's see who's available.

31:22.098 --> 31:24.035
Don't know what I was thinking
to take this on

31:24.070 --> 31:26.550
and I don't know how I could
ever have done it without you.

31:26.585 --> 31:29.455
I'm happy to help.
Mom, just figure out the designer;

31:29.456 --> 31:31.755
I'll handle
the rest of the logistics.

31:31.790 --> 31:33.107
Hi!

31:33.108 --> 31:36.426
So I'm here,
and I brought my truck as requested.

31:36.462 --> 31:40.097
Great! Thanks, Luke. OK, so
you guys go pick up the trees;

31:40.132 --> 31:41.965
I'll try and find
another designer.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.835
Why do we need his truck?
And what trees?

31:44.870 --> 31:48.595
The lot downtown is donating trees
for the foyer and the living room.

31:48.630 --> 31:51.942
- Wait, what happened to the designer?
- Mom, why would you call Luke?

31:51.977 --> 31:55.004
I can totally take Parker's car.
I can handle this.

31:55.039 --> 31:58.727
You're gonna pick up three Christmas
trees by yourself in a rental car?

31:58.762 --> 32:00.183
I would have figured it out.

32:00.219 --> 32:04.688
Well, now, you don't have to!
So, you two, go pick up the trees;

32:04.723 --> 32:07.090
I'm gonna try and stop
this event from imploding.

32:07.126 --> 32:10.360
Wait.
What happened to the designer?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.996
I'll tell you on the way.

32:21.507 --> 32:25.609
Why don't you just wait here and I'll
get the guy to bring the trees over.

32:27.913 --> 32:30.414
Hi! I'm here for the trees
that were donated.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.753
- Do you want some help?
- No. I got it.

32:43.896 --> 32:46.363
Are you sure? 'Cause it looks like
you could use some help.

32:46.398 --> 32:50.200
- I'm totally fine.
- You're doing great!

32:50.235 --> 32:54.538
- Yeah, just two more after that.
- Yep! Just... just two more.

33:01.914 --> 33:05.482
- I'm so sorry.
- How about now?

33:05.517 --> 33:08.151
- You want some help now?
- Yeah, yeah.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.153
It would appear that I would.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.055
No, you gotta say it
like you mean it.

33:12.091 --> 33:16.026
I, Darcy Fitzwilliam,
would love your help.

33:16.061 --> 33:18.061
Just get over here
and help me, please.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.197
Thought you'd never ask.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.332
I cannot believe this.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.402
I'm so sorry.
We're going to pick them up.

33:25.437 --> 33:29.039
Well, he's gonna pick them up.
Yeah.

33:29.074 --> 33:31.975
Thank you.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.482
- Just go ahead, say it.
- Wasn't gonna say anything.

33:38.517 --> 33:41.251
You were dying to.
It's written all over your face.

33:41.286 --> 33:45.934
OK, why do you go through life like
you always have something to prove?

33:45.958 --> 33:47.341
Because I'm a Fitzwilliam.

33:47.342 --> 33:50.200
Everyone assumes I've had everything
handed to me my whole life.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.195
And there's nothing I can do
to convince them

33:52.231 --> 33:54.698
I've actually earned my place.
I mean, you said it yourself.

33:54.733 --> 33:58.135
You said it was DNA and luck
that got me where I am.

34:00.806 --> 34:03.006
Well, I didn't really mean that.

34:03.042 --> 34:06.022
I always envied how easy
you had it and maybe you just...

34:06.057 --> 34:07.344
...made it look that way.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.880
Wait. I always thought
the same thing about you!

34:10.956 --> 34:14.205
You were always so
charming and magnetic.

34:14.206 --> 34:17.454
I mean, you didn't even have to try,
and you'd win every single time.

34:17.489 --> 34:19.856
I always felt like I had
to try extra hard to win.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.156
It's no different
when you're not a Fitzwilliam.

34:26.757 --> 34:28.888
So is that why you never went
to work for your dad?

34:28.900 --> 34:30.684
No, I did work for my dad.

34:30.685 --> 34:32.896
Yeah, and he taught
me everything I know.

34:32.897 --> 34:37.706
But when it... it came time
for a promotion, I... I passed.

34:38.782 --> 34:41.591
I could see the way people looked
at me in the office, and I...

34:41.746 --> 34:44.114
I knew I'd never have
their respect.

34:44.149 --> 34:47.617
- Why care what people think?
- I don't.

34:47.652 --> 34:51.154
Who are you trying
to prove yourself to?

34:51.190 --> 34:54.257
There's not a single person
in this town...

34:54.293 --> 34:56.949
who ever doubted that you do
something exceptional with your life.

34:57.481 --> 34:59.062
You don't have
to prove anything.

35:00.113 --> 35:01.665
Thank you.

35:03.285 --> 35:05.635
- We should...
- Yeah.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.075
OK, Erica, I'm on.

35:12.111 --> 35:14.077
Here goes. Patching you in.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.413
We'll just table that 'til later.

35:16.448 --> 35:19.249
Hi, everyone. Sorry I'm late
for the partners' meeting.

35:19.284 --> 35:21.418
What did I miss?

35:21.453 --> 35:24.020
With it being the holidays,

35:24.056 --> 35:26.423
we didn't want to ruin your
trip with trivial details.

35:26.458 --> 35:30.861
I am interested in all details,
trivial or otherwise.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.966
Then I'll just come out
and say it.

35:35.967 --> 35:40.704
We're all in agreement that if potential
clients can't meet our investment minimums,

35:40.739 --> 35:43.273
we don't have the resources
to support them.

35:43.308 --> 35:46.009
It will pay for itself
in the long run.

35:46.044 --> 35:49.386
Our goal has always been to compete
with the biggest Wall Street players,

35:49.421 --> 35:50.421
and we're almost there.

35:50.716 --> 35:53.660
Yes. And by opening ourselves up
to all potential investors,

35:53.695 --> 35:55.085
that only gets us there faster.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.553
But, Darcy,

35:56.589 --> 35:59.456
with all due respect, that's not
the vision we have for this firm,

35:59.491 --> 36:02.624
and I think everyone at this table
is in agreement with that.

36:03.254 --> 36:04.961
So what are you saying?

36:04.997 --> 36:08.932
Either stay on this train
or hop off at the next station.

36:08.967 --> 36:12.636
I'm not selling my share.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.638
Understood, Darcy.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.574
Why don't we all enjoy
our holidays

36:17.609 --> 36:22.279
and we'll table this conversation
until after the first of the year.

36:26.652 --> 36:29.319
No, I completely understand.
It really is short notice.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.588
So thank you anyway! Bye!

36:31.623 --> 36:33.657
Still no luck
finding a designer?

36:33.692 --> 36:36.393
Four days before event, and
no one's available. Imagine that.

36:36.428 --> 36:38.995
Well, I did get Caylee's uncle
to donate a gold bracelet

36:39.031 --> 36:41.264
from his jewelry store,
so there's that.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.650
I'm gonna go pick it up now.

36:42.651 --> 36:46.736
Thank you, darling, that's wonderful, but
the trees, they're our big ticket items.

36:46.772 --> 36:49.547
I don't know what we're gonna do, but
we're gonna figure something out, Mom.

36:49.571 --> 36:51.975
Well, better do it soon.

36:57.520 --> 36:58.648
Hi!

37:10.337 --> 37:11.528
<i>So you made it?</i>

37:12.226 --> 37:14.764
Around this time of year,
most of my interior-design jobs

37:14.800 --> 37:19.202
...are Christmas decorating.
That window is my calling card.

37:19.238 --> 37:21.171
The trees really auction off
for a lot?

37:21.206 --> 37:24.829
Yes. And yours is just as beautiful
as the ones at the Kirkwood auction.

37:24.864 --> 37:28.311
You can definitely have that one,
but how many more will you need?

37:28.347 --> 37:29.553
Five.

37:30.482 --> 37:32.349
I know,
but you could have the help

37:32.384 --> 37:34.295
you could possibly need
from me and my entire family.

37:34.319 --> 37:37.621
And it would be a great
opportunity for you as well.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.705
OK, count me in.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.151
You have a truck
that could fit that tree?

37:43.595 --> 37:47.530
No, but I know someone
who does.

37:48.504 --> 37:51.136
So, Charlene will put the tree
back together tomorrow,

37:51.171 --> 37:54.871
and I'm just glad we're able to bring
most of the stuff to the house tonight.

37:54.906 --> 37:56.918
I just hope she's able to
finish all these trees in time.

37:56.942 --> 38:00.649
A few trees are better than none,
and I'll do whatever I can to help out.

38:00.746 --> 38:01.467
Good, thank you.

38:01.468 --> 38:04.981
She said her supplier is actually gonna
be donating all the tree trimmings.

38:05.017 --> 38:07.851
Best thing about Pemberley:
we show up for each other.

38:07.886 --> 38:10.186
And I'm glad it's Charlene
and not just,

38:10.222 --> 38:14.557
you know, not some fancy designer who
"we need her more than she needs us".

38:14.593 --> 38:17.894
- You like helping people.
- But don't tell anyone.

38:17.929 --> 38:21.177
I don't want to ruin my image
of being all charmed and spoiled.

38:21.212 --> 38:24.901
My lips are sealed.
Let's say we take a little break.

38:24.936 --> 38:26.875
Just maybe an hour to
check out Pemberley Carols.

38:26.876 --> 38:29.183
It's not like we can do much
without Charlene tonight anyways,

38:29.207 --> 38:30.785
and it looks like
everyone else is going.

38:30.809 --> 38:34.244
- It's a big night for the town.
- So what do you think?

38:34.279 --> 38:36.346
I think we are going caroling.

38:36.381 --> 38:38.381
And I'm finally gonna get
my roasted chestnuts.

38:40.452 --> 38:43.219
You know, I've actually never
even tried a roasted chestnut.

38:43.255 --> 38:46.550
What?! OK, there are so many
things wrong with that statement.

38:46.585 --> 38:48.024
Least of which, you're a chef.

38:48.060 --> 38:50.660
- Is it criminal?
- Yeah. It's totally criminal.

39:00.739 --> 39:02.772
Smell that?

39:02.808 --> 39:06.109
- Yep.
- Smells great, what is it?

39:06.144 --> 39:08.945
- Home.
- And chestnuts.

39:08.980 --> 39:13.450
- My girl came through for me today.
- Darcy always comes through.

39:13.485 --> 39:16.252
It's just a step
in the right direction.

39:35.495 --> 39:37.107
Chestnuts?

39:40.745 --> 39:44.009
OK. I am primed and ready.
I hope you didn't oversell.

39:44.044 --> 39:47.199
If I did, it just means
more for me, so it's a win.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.487
Thank you!

39:50.956 --> 39:52.286
Alright.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.876
You lose. I like it.

39:58.230 --> 39:59.391
I already know what
I'm gonna do with them.

39:59.392 --> 40:01.438
I'm mentally preparing a dish
right now.

40:02.300 --> 40:04.334
You love what you do.

40:05.139 --> 40:06.242
You do.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.506
I can see it
when you talk about it.

40:09.541 --> 40:11.674
Passed down from my dad.

40:11.710 --> 40:13.643
His love for food
was infectious.

40:13.678 --> 40:16.613
Every day, 6 p.m.,

40:16.648 --> 40:18.782
family dinner before he'd go work
the nightshift.

40:18.817 --> 40:20.617
That was his rule.

40:20.652 --> 40:22.819
Your dad was a good guy.

40:22.854 --> 40:25.288
I remember
he never missed a debate.

40:26.725 --> 40:29.726
Yeah.
You know, the plan was

40:29.761 --> 40:33.597
after culinary school, that I would
open a restaurant with him.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.131
It was family style.

40:36.342 --> 40:39.235
And I was off in Cincinnati
working and saving, then...

40:43.108 --> 40:45.308
Life happens.

40:45.543 --> 40:48.044
I wasn't going to give up
on our dream;

40:48.079 --> 40:50.680
I'm just... doing it alone.

40:52.884 --> 40:56.586
He was a good man.
I bet he'd be proud.

40:56.621 --> 41:00.156
I'd be happy to be half the man
that he was.

41:00.192 --> 41:03.426
Just, you get to a point in life
when someday becomes now

41:03.462 --> 41:05.662
and you just gotta go for it full on.

41:07.799 --> 41:11.738
I think that's why I felt like I...
I just had to break it off with Carl.

41:11.773 --> 41:12.702
I knew it!

41:12.737 --> 41:14.782
I knew there was something
going on with you and that guy.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.789
I mean, was it the crippling awkwardness
that gave it away?

41:18.824 --> 41:22.278
It could have been the daggers
that he's been staring at me.

41:22.314 --> 41:24.914
He doesn't mean anything by it.
He's... he's a good guy.

41:26.985 --> 41:32.889
He's the perfect guy.
Perfect job, perfect life.

41:33.623 --> 41:37.327
Well, sometimes perfect
only exists on the surface.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.329
I've been there.
My last relationship.

41:39.364 --> 41:43.399
And you can't stay in something
just because it makes sense on paper.

41:43.435 --> 41:45.768
That is exactly where I was.

41:45.804 --> 41:48.765
I think that's why it's been good
for me to take a step back this week

41:48.800 --> 41:51.441
and just look at the big picture.

41:51.476 --> 41:57.146
And then the question becomes:
you really want to step back in?

41:57.182 --> 42:00.976
Look, you two are sitting
underneath the mistletoe.

42:01.011 --> 42:02.352
You know what that means.

42:03.932 --> 42:05.922
Yeah, a mistletoe.

42:05.957 --> 42:09.540
It's a great question actually. What
does a kiss under the mistletoe mean?

42:09.575 --> 42:10.527
I haven't had the time.

42:10.562 --> 42:12.529
- Really?
- I've been a little busy!

42:12.564 --> 42:14.275
- Please.
- Alright, I'm on it.

42:14.299 --> 42:16.299
Yeah.
I'll believe it when I see it.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.236
I do have to say though.

42:22.140 --> 42:26.492
You are every ounce
the man your dad was.

42:37.355 --> 42:38.855
Come on.

42:46.598 --> 42:47.853
This is the last of them.

42:47.854 --> 42:51.334
You could just put it there
next to Charlene's supplies. Thanks.

42:51.369 --> 42:54.470
Cocoa, everyone!

42:54.506 --> 42:57.507
OK, so I should get going.

42:57.542 --> 43:00.176
No, no. Luke, stay.
Have some cocoa.

43:00.211 --> 43:01.911
The more the merrier,
I always say.

43:01.947 --> 43:05.348
- Yeah, stay.
- OK.

43:05.383 --> 43:07.917
It's lopsided.

43:07.953 --> 43:09.730
Yeah, you know what? It needs
to go a little bit on the left.

43:09.754 --> 43:12.392
- What?
- Yeah, it needs to be, you know,

43:12.427 --> 43:14.691
perfectly symmetrical.
Have I taught you nothing?

43:14.726 --> 43:16.893
Perfectionists, both of you.

43:16.928 --> 43:21.931
I mean, he can take out an appendix,
but he can't hang Christmas lights.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.603
I ran into Sally Bassman
just as were leaving tonight.

43:26.638 --> 43:28.838
Ticket sales are down.

43:28.839 --> 43:33.076
I suspect it's the rumour mill,
us taking it on at the late stage

43:33.111 --> 43:35.078
...and then losing the designer...

43:35.113 --> 43:38.414
...but why do people
have to talk so much?

43:38.450 --> 43:42.051
OK, so we change the narrative.

43:42.087 --> 43:44.981
You know, we talk about the Youth
Center, how it benefits them.

43:45.016 --> 43:48.731
And maybe we do an e-mail blast to
the Pemberley League's entire mailing list.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.694
Yeah, that's a great idea.
Caylee's a graphic designer,

43:51.730 --> 43:53.808
I'm sure she could come up
with something great for us.

43:53.832 --> 43:56.599
- Now, that is a good idea.
- I could talk to my brother,

43:56.635 --> 43:58.935
have him reach out to the
clientele at his law firm too.

43:58.970 --> 44:00.587
Yeah, and Dad's clients.

44:00.588 --> 44:03.740
Those are the people who would
come to this event anyway.

44:03.775 --> 44:06.275
Many of them are, but I'll be happy
to reach out to others.

44:06.311 --> 44:09.379
OK, let's create new buzz.

44:09.414 --> 44:12.215
I think it's time
for the tree topper.

44:12.250 --> 44:16.902
Well, I'm not allowed to climb,
lift or eat sushi.

44:16.903 --> 44:19.828
I know this doesn't apply
to what we're doing here,

44:19.863 --> 44:22.558
...but I'm really
gonna miss sushi.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.063
Darcy,
why don't you do the honours.

44:27.098 --> 44:29.465
OK.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.567
- Can you grab the ladder?
- Yeah.

44:46.820 --> 44:48.910
Next part is my job.

44:49.068 --> 44:50.987
Edward, get the lights.

45:03.334 --> 45:05.735
So pretty.

45:16.263 --> 45:18.098
I actually have to...
Sorry.

45:18.099 --> 45:23.459
Although honestly, I think it's a bit dim
down at the bottom here.

45:23.460 --> 45:26.322
- Erica, it's so late.
- I was finishing year-end statements.

45:26.357 --> 45:28.558
Have you checked
your e-mail recently?

45:28.593 --> 45:31.894
- No, why?
- Austin didn't waste any time.

45:31.930 --> 45:34.197
- Hey, what's going on?
- A message from the Maberlys.

45:34.232 --> 45:36.699
They want Austin
on their account from now on.

45:36.735 --> 45:40.503
She's poaching my client?
She is trying to drive me out.

45:40.504 --> 45:42.489
Clearly.
I knew she was a snake.

45:42.490 --> 45:44.078
Listen, I need you to call
Mark Spencer

45:44.079 --> 45:46.400
and let him know I need to speak
with him immediately.

45:46.435 --> 45:47.755
I'm gonna
leave him a message as well.

45:47.779 --> 45:51.814
Yes. OK. We need to get to him
before Austin tells him who knows what.

45:51.850 --> 45:55.184
That's what I intend
to do. Thank you, Erica.

45:55.220 --> 45:56.974
Work call this hour?

45:57.789 --> 46:02.191
Yeah. You know the old story.

46:02.227 --> 46:04.560
Go into business with people,
operate with integrity,

46:04.596 --> 46:06.434
and they try to drive you out
anyway.

46:06.498 --> 46:09.031
That story. I hate that story.

46:09.067 --> 46:10.667
Yeah, me too.

46:10.668 --> 46:13.354
The one time I didn't
do everything on my own.

46:13.355 --> 46:15.998
It's OK to put your trust
in people, Darcy.

46:16.668 --> 46:18.841
Some of us still know your worth.

46:20.745 --> 46:23.446
- Good night.
- Good night.

46:34.826 --> 46:38.227
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

46:38.263 --> 46:40.463
- Coffee's ready.
- Oh, good.

46:40.498 --> 46:43.178
Darling, do you mind running over
to the Pemberley Youth Center?

46:43.213 --> 46:47.336
They've got a banner that they're
gonna be displaying at the auction,

46:47.372 --> 46:50.624
and I was to be there at 9
to meet with the director,

46:50.659 --> 46:54.577
but now I have to meet
with the Pemberley League board.

46:54.612 --> 46:56.679
Really? Why?

46:56.714 --> 46:58.648
They didn't say, but...

46:58.683 --> 47:01.184
I'm afraid
with the low-ticket sales,

47:01.219 --> 47:03.063
they just might pull the plug
on the whole thing,

47:03.087 --> 47:05.855
and that would be just so upsetting
for the children.

47:05.890 --> 47:08.057
I'll keep reaching out
to my client base.

47:08.092 --> 47:11.476
Yeah. I can reach out to mine too.
Well, most of them.

47:11.994 --> 47:13.728
And I know people nearby,

47:13.729 --> 47:16.532
I'm sure at the very least, they'd be
happy to donate to a good cause.

47:16.568 --> 47:19.335
Don't think they're gonna pull
the plug this late in the game.

47:19.370 --> 47:22.038
- Well, we'll soon find out.
- Luke's on his way over.

47:22.073 --> 47:23.739
Why don't you let us grab
the banner,

47:23.775 --> 47:26.509
and then you tell the board
we've got it under control.

47:26.544 --> 47:30.179
Good luck.

47:36.154 --> 47:39.101
And it's all thanks to the support
of the Pemberley League.

47:39.136 --> 47:43.726
In fact, those kids playing volleyball
back there, every piece of equipment

47:43.761 --> 47:46.195
was the result of last year's
holiday auction.

47:46.425 --> 47:48.898
Art supplies, music.

47:48.949 --> 47:51.103
We even have a youth choir now.

48:31.250 --> 48:34.308
And that's the banner.
Come on down, kids.

48:37.715 --> 48:40.716
As a way to say thank you.
They picked it out themselves.

48:42.720 --> 48:46.022
Thank you.
This... this is so sweet.

48:46.057 --> 48:47.790
Alright, everyone,

48:47.825 --> 48:51.227
you can go back to making your
gingerbread houses. Come on.

48:54.532 --> 48:56.299
You know what?
That's how we sell tickets.

48:56.334 --> 48:59.226
We give the people something like that.
Something that moves them.

48:59.261 --> 49:01.533
We could see if they'll perform
at the auction.

49:01.568 --> 49:02.905
Yeah, but that's only good
the day of.

49:02.906 --> 49:05.246
We need people to know
about these kids before then.

49:07.679 --> 49:09.679
Wait, what if we put...

49:09.714 --> 49:11.981
what if we put some sort of video
in the e-mail blast?

49:12.016 --> 49:14.517
We put a face on it, and
that'll get people to show up.

49:14.552 --> 49:16.230
I've got a really great camera
on my phone.

49:16.254 --> 49:19.322
- Great. We should tell Beverly.
- Wait.

49:19.357 --> 49:23.025
I've been thinking, and I'm
gonna waive my catering fee.

49:23.061 --> 49:25.647
All the money needs to go to the event,
not overhead.

49:25.682 --> 49:27.530
Luke, no, you can't do that.

49:27.565 --> 49:32.301
You need the money for supplies and
staff and to help with your renovations.

49:32.337 --> 49:35.671
So, I just put it off
for a little while. It's worth it.

49:37.375 --> 49:39.875
I... Well, I don't know
what to say.

49:39.911 --> 49:43.512
You know, my parents, a lot
of their friends are investors,

49:43.548 --> 49:47.450
and they invest in things
other than the stock market.

49:47.485 --> 49:50.419
Would these friends perhaps
be coming to the auction?

49:50.455 --> 49:52.888
I know a few who are, yes.

49:52.924 --> 49:56.555
And if there's anything they love
more than a good business idea,

49:56.590 --> 49:58.027
...it's a good meal.

50:05.737 --> 50:08.204
<i>Hi, Mark.
It's Darcy Fitzwilliam again.</i>

50:08.239 --> 50:10.079
Could you call me back
as soon as you get this?

50:10.108 --> 50:12.908
It's very important.
I'm available on cell anytime.

50:12.944 --> 50:14.910
Thank you.

50:14.946 --> 50:17.057
I think I should go to New York
for a meeting with him.

50:17.081 --> 50:20.082
It'd help secure the account
if you're there in person.

50:20.118 --> 50:22.084
Great. Darcy.

50:22.933 --> 50:26.722
I'm gonna be in New York the second
week in January. Make time for dinner?

50:26.758 --> 50:28.924
- Maybe all three of us?
- Yeah.

50:28.960 --> 50:32.461
Yeah, we can definitely find a date
that works for everyone.

50:32.497 --> 50:35.766
- What time does the designer come?
- Around 3.

50:35.767 --> 50:39.869
Carl and I will finish our work
and then we'll help out.

50:39.904 --> 50:41.815
- Happy to be of service.
- Sure, that sounds great.

50:41.839 --> 50:44.106
Thanks, you guys.

50:47.745 --> 50:49.679
Hey, how'd it go with the board?

50:49.680 --> 50:52.815
Well, they're not pulling the plug.
Yet.

50:52.850 --> 50:55.618
I think they just needed to be
reassured I did my best.

50:55.653 --> 50:58.554
I'm having them send
their email list directly to you.

50:58.589 --> 51:02.058
Great. Caylee and Luke are
in the kitchen editing the video,

51:02.093 --> 51:05.094
- ...so it should go out today.
- OK. Not a moment too soon.

51:06.138 --> 51:07.296
Alright.

51:13.471 --> 51:14.771
How's it going?

51:14.772 --> 51:18.057
OK, so the link works; I just
need to merge these contacts...

51:18.058 --> 51:19.942
...and it's sent.

51:20.178 --> 51:23.612
Thanks so much. I'll make sure
everyone knows you're helpful.

51:23.648 --> 51:26.115
Good. I'm a one-woman show
and I could use the publicity.

51:26.150 --> 51:28.784
- Well, that is the idea.
- OK, see you guys later.

51:28.820 --> 51:30.764
- I gotta go meet your brother.
- Thank you, Caylee.

51:30.788 --> 51:33.789
I wanted to tell you: I'm
gonna put a sign on the table...

51:33.825 --> 51:35.869
- ...that you donated all the food.
- You don't have to do that.

51:35.893 --> 51:38.494
- I'm bringing business cards.
- We're doing it for everybody.

51:38.529 --> 51:40.046
You're not that special.

51:40.047 --> 51:43.666
And here I thought it was
because you were warming to me.

51:43.701 --> 51:46.586
But the sign is still gonna
have to say "Metro Tavern"...

51:46.638 --> 51:47.980
...because you don't have a name.

51:47.981 --> 51:49.928
It's not a decision that
can be taken lightly.

51:49.929 --> 51:52.675
It's like
naming your child or a pet.

51:52.710 --> 51:56.545
- There's no going back.
- I get it. You want it to...

51:56.581 --> 51:59.849
- ...feel like they're at your table.
- Yes.

51:59.884 --> 52:02.284
That's it.

52:02.320 --> 52:06.155
Luke's Table.
It's so simple.

52:06.190 --> 52:09.825
I bet you cannot believe
you didn't come up with that.

52:09.861 --> 52:12.862
I may have had a fleeting thought,
once or twice.

52:12.897 --> 52:15.331
Well, you're not the only one
with good ideas here, buddy.

52:15.366 --> 52:19.101
Charlene's here and needs help
unloading. Give us a hand?

52:35.620 --> 52:38.687
- What?
- No, you did not.

52:38.723 --> 52:41.490
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

52:41.526 --> 52:44.627
OK.
I must have just imagined it.

52:53.538 --> 52:56.539
Guess you just imagined that too?

52:56.574 --> 52:59.108
- Really?
- You started this.

52:59.143 --> 53:02.511
- And I'm gonna finish it.
- Don't count on it!

53:05.750 --> 53:09.885
- OK, OK!
- I definitely won.

53:16.727 --> 53:17.931
I didn't have much time
to plan,

53:17.932 --> 53:20.791
but I've come up with some
designs you'll really like.

53:20.826 --> 53:22.958
If they're half as beautiful
as the Montgomery store...

53:22.982 --> 53:24.900
I've got everything we need...

53:24.936 --> 53:27.281
...and I think we can get them done
in time with all hands on deck.

53:27.305 --> 53:30.606
You have me until tomorrow.
I've got a lot of food prep.

53:30.641 --> 53:33.409
If you need some help,
we could come after.

53:33.444 --> 53:36.412
- I will. That'd be great.
- You know what I was thinking?

53:36.447 --> 53:40.149
What if we curtained off this room,
kept the trees a surprise

53:40.184 --> 53:42.651
and there was this big reveal
after the guests arrived?

53:42.687 --> 53:45.421
That's a perfect idea.
Keep the suspense up.

53:45.456 --> 53:48.023
Alright then, let's get started.

54:01.539 --> 54:03.772
What's happening?

54:03.808 --> 54:06.909
- What's that?
- This is great.

54:06.944 --> 54:08.789
Yeah, it's a good look for ya.

54:08.813 --> 54:10.813
I actually have to...

54:10.848 --> 54:13.749
OK, here. Spin out.

54:16.287 --> 54:20.289
Hello, Darcy Fitzwilliam.

54:20.919 --> 54:22.591
Erica, hi.
Did Mark Spencer call back?

54:22.627 --> 54:25.060
No, but I think it's time
for you to come back.

54:25.096 --> 54:26.396
Why? What's wrong now?

54:26.397 --> 54:28.568
Another client jumped ship
to Austin Avery.

54:29.524 --> 54:32.368
- Who?
- Gambill.

54:32.403 --> 54:35.337
Whatever Austin's saying
to poison them must be good.

54:35.373 --> 54:38.307
- I made them a lot of money.
- Austin's purposely doing this

54:38.342 --> 54:41.377
while you're gone. You need
to come back here and fight.

54:41.412 --> 54:43.012
I can't, the event is in 2 days.

54:43.013 --> 54:47.052
Keep calling Mark Spencer,
I will do the same. He's the key.

54:49.253 --> 54:50.606
Are you OK?

54:53.814 --> 54:55.686
Yeah, great.

54:55.687 --> 54:58.827
I'm not gonna say anything
about us or your business...

54:58.828 --> 55:00.663
...or even working for your dad.

55:00.698 --> 55:04.833
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

55:05.896 --> 55:08.804
That means a lot to me, Carl.
Thank you.

55:24.288 --> 55:26.689
Hi, Darce. I didn't
know anyone was here.

55:26.691 --> 55:30.010
Want some pie? It's chocolate
with an eggnog swirl.

55:30.027 --> 55:31.496
Luke's recipe.

55:32.930 --> 55:35.531
You don't have
to invite me twice.

55:36.295 --> 55:38.063
You had me at pie.

55:41.072 --> 55:44.106
You know, today,

55:44.895 --> 55:48.804
I was looking around when
we were working on the trees...

55:49.615 --> 55:51.410
...and I was thinking...

55:51.615 --> 55:54.917
The house feels alive.

55:54.952 --> 55:59.288
Yeah, it's the Christmas spirit.
It's contagious.

56:02.060 --> 56:05.661
So, what's the occasion
for such a decadent treat?

56:05.696 --> 56:09.298
I think it's the phrase,
"pie clears the mind".

56:13.971 --> 56:17.606
You want to talk about it?

56:19.677 --> 56:23.145
Dad, are you happy
in your work?

56:23.180 --> 56:26.582
I mean, you've built this
incredible empire, but...

56:26.617 --> 56:29.017
...are you really happy?

56:29.053 --> 56:32.921
Work isn't only about the job.
Sometimes it's about...

56:32.957 --> 56:36.091
...what kind of footprint you want
to leave after you're gone.

56:36.127 --> 56:37.927
That's important to you.

56:37.928 --> 56:42.143
I was always determined to build
something that would outlast me.

56:42.201 --> 56:45.101
Me, too. And we have.

56:45.102 --> 56:49.204
That's why it meant so much to me
to have you be a part of it.

56:50.209 --> 56:53.208
Dad, if you value me so much,
you have to value my judgment.

56:53.244 --> 56:57.146
I do.
I just know you're unhappy.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.615
This stuff with your partners,

56:59.616 --> 57:03.419
maybe it's a message
that it's time to move on.

57:03.454 --> 57:07.089
You know,
Carl is a great young man.

57:07.124 --> 57:10.907
The two of you, together, would take
my company through the stratosphere.

57:10.942 --> 57:15.014
The problem with that is...
it's what would make YOU happy.

57:15.015 --> 57:18.025
- I just want the best for you.
- I know. I just...

57:19.270 --> 57:21.390
I'm being pushed out.

57:21.439 --> 57:24.606
My best client isn't
calling me back, I...

57:25.828 --> 57:27.877
I don't know what's best for me.

57:27.912 --> 57:30.511
You know what I've always
told you and your brother.

57:31.282 --> 57:36.018
When somebody tries to wrong you,
do you cave or do you fight?

57:36.053 --> 57:41.690
My Di has always been to fight,
but...

57:41.725 --> 57:44.695
I guess this time I don't know
if I'd be fighting just to win.

57:45.129 --> 57:48.617
There's another part to that
advice that I should've added;

57:48.766 --> 57:53.402
Walking away isn't always
a sign of weakness.

57:53.437 --> 57:57.597
Sometimes it's an even
bigger show of strength.

57:59.161 --> 58:00.667
Thanks, Dad.

58:02.246 --> 58:04.488
What you need is more pie.

58:13.225 --> 58:17.051
Hi! My parents are helping Charlene
finish the last tree...

58:17.086 --> 58:18.727
...so you have your sous-chef.

58:18.762 --> 58:22.374
Good, because your mom just
texted me the final head count.

58:22.833 --> 58:24.133
I think the video's working.

58:24.134 --> 58:26.653
We've gotten more ticket sales
since the email went out.

58:26.654 --> 58:28.997
Yeah, we have so much to do
to get ready for tomorrow.

58:29.032 --> 58:31.862
We need to get started,
'cause I have to go buy a dress.

58:31.897 --> 58:33.924
I mean, I can't wear this.

58:33.944 --> 58:37.813
See? Aren't you glad
that you didn't re-gift it?

58:37.848 --> 58:40.082
Yeah. This just...

58:40.117 --> 58:42.551
This smells incredible.
It smells like Christmas.

58:42.586 --> 58:44.820
I had no idea you were
such a talented chef.

58:46.457 --> 58:48.857
Why don't you take some pies
out of the oven to cool,

58:48.893 --> 58:50.493
and I'll finish this up.

58:50.494 --> 58:52.694
They're chocolate chestnut,
by the way.

58:52.730 --> 58:56.724
A friend of mine recently introduced me
to chestnuts so I had to run with it.

58:56.759 --> 58:58.923
- Stop it!
- No, I refuse.

59:03.341 --> 59:04.539
You're amazing.

59:08.245 --> 59:13.875
I mean, you're an amazing chef.
You're like a superhero with pies.

59:15.553 --> 59:17.273
It's our song.

59:18.088 --> 59:21.623
Said no one ever. I'm sorry,
Jingle Bells cannot be our song.

59:21.659 --> 59:23.069
What's wrong with Jingle Bells?
It's a classic.

59:23.093 --> 59:26.628
- For a 3rd grade recital.
- Fine.

59:29.822 --> 59:32.935
- An improvement?
- It's not.

59:35.739 --> 59:39.975
This is impressive.
What is happening right now?

59:45.493 --> 59:49.920
OK. There's something I want
to show you that I made.

59:49.955 --> 59:54.309
These were the place cards for
Christmas dinner when I was a kid.

59:54.344 --> 59:56.169
I'm gonna put them
on all the food tables.

59:56.193 --> 59:58.460
This is adorable.
And so clever.

59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.562
I've got dozens of
little ideas like this.

01:00:00.598 --> 01:00:03.098
Never know which one I'm gonna
pull out of my sleeve that day.

01:00:05.536 --> 01:00:08.604
So why don't you sugar those
and I'll finish up with this.

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:10.739
Of course. Right.

01:00:15.679 --> 01:00:17.613
You know, you're really lucky.

01:00:17.648 --> 01:00:19.198
How's that?

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:23.485
You know exactly what you want
and how to go about getting it.

01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.026
I'm just trying to do
what I love.

01:00:28.524 --> 01:00:30.548
What is it that you love,
Darcy?

01:00:31.279 --> 01:00:33.412
I love my job.
I do.

01:00:33.447 --> 01:00:36.431
But it's not just about accounts,

01:00:36.467 --> 01:00:39.768
it's about the people behind the
accounts that matter, you know.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:42.170
I'm just trying to get my
colleagues to see it that way.

01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:44.339
I feel like we should use
our resources

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.942
to help everybody become
financially secure.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:51.113
And I know I can make a difference
if they would let me.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.576
You may not feel like you're
making a difference, but...

01:00:57.465 --> 01:00:58.945
...you are in other ways.

01:01:11.463 --> 01:01:12.746
Why you keep checking
your phone?

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:16.038
I'm just waiting
for a client to call.

01:01:17.204 --> 01:01:19.408
You know what?
I think I like the other one better.

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:21.710
The boutique's gonna let me
bring one back tomorrow.

01:01:21.745 --> 01:01:24.613
Plus they donated a gown
for the silent auction.

01:01:24.648 --> 01:01:28.050
You really got the community
to step up. That's great.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.970
Yeah, this one's pretty, but
I think I like the red better, too.

01:01:33.091 --> 01:01:35.775
Yes, with there been Christmas
I feel red's more appropriate, right?

01:01:35.776 --> 01:01:39.798
Plus it looks great on you, in case
there's anyone you want to impress.

01:01:40.431 --> 01:01:42.269
There's not.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:48.437
The more I think about Carl,
as great as he is, I just...

01:01:49.259 --> 01:01:51.073
It's become very clear to me
this week...

01:01:51.108 --> 01:01:53.575
...that I don't think
I can get back with him.

01:01:53.610 --> 01:01:56.778
I need to move forward.
And I need to be honest with him,

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:59.915
but first I have to get through
this party unscathed.

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:04.120
Could it be one Luke Bennett
that brought on this revelation?

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:05.131
What are you talking about?

01:02:05.155 --> 01:02:07.288
Come on. I saw you two
at Pemberley Carols.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:08.830
What does it matter?

01:02:08.831 --> 01:02:12.426
I'm going back to New York after
Christmas and he has a business, here.

01:02:12.496 --> 01:02:15.858
- Look, I'm gonna be blunt.
- Is that a new thing for you, really?

01:02:15.893 --> 01:02:20.368
I have noticed a light in you
this week. It's nice to see.

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:23.337
It's because I'm with my family,
and the event, and Christmas...

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:24.888
And Luke.

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.676
Jim says he's noticed the
same thing in his brother.

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:30.178
Yeah, because we're working
on something together.

01:02:30.214 --> 01:02:32.180
We're working
towards a common goal.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:36.184
Darce, you can deny what's
going on right under your nose,

01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:37.470
...but I'm not going to.

01:02:38.404 --> 01:02:41.423
I mean, how could it ever work?
We live in two different cities.

01:02:41.459 --> 01:02:43.385
Darce, you haven't been
happy for a while now.

01:02:43.386 --> 01:02:45.391
Maybe it's time to not only
change up your business...

01:02:45.392 --> 01:02:49.397
...but change your geography too.

01:02:55.489 --> 01:02:57.606
And we've already
removed all the furniture.

01:02:57.641 --> 01:03:03.294
Darce! This is Sally Bassman
from the Pemberley League board.

01:03:03.329 --> 01:03:06.613
She's just come here for a little
walk-through before the event tonight.

01:03:06.648 --> 01:03:10.255
I was just telling your mother
everything looks exquisite.

01:03:10.256 --> 01:03:15.230
Calling your family was one of the
best decisions we could've made, really.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:18.059
- You pulled it off beautifully.
- Thank you, Sally.

01:03:18.095 --> 01:03:20.095
We've actually had a
lot of outside help, too.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:22.150
Hey, Darcy, have you heard
from the service staff?

01:03:22.199 --> 01:03:24.016
I haven't seen any servers yet.

01:03:24.017 --> 01:03:26.476
No, I haven't, but I'm sure
they're on the way.

01:03:26.477 --> 01:03:27.736
Everything okay, Luke?

01:03:28.999 --> 01:03:33.254
Yeah. Of course. They're not even
late yet. I was just wondering.

01:03:33.964 --> 01:03:36.459
Sally, meet Luke Bennett.
He's our caterer.

01:03:36.515 --> 01:03:40.852
He's actually helped plan the event from
top to bottom, truly every single detail.

01:03:40.887 --> 01:03:43.407
And Sally Bassman's on
the Pemberley League board.

01:03:43.442 --> 01:03:45.637
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.877
Here they are.
Text from the staffing service.

01:03:50.912 --> 01:03:52.718
Servers are on their way.

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:56.331
Great.
Sally's not only on the board,

01:03:56.366 --> 01:04:00.159
she's also one of the original investors
in Dairy Leaf Ice Creamery.

01:04:00.194 --> 01:04:01.657
I love that place.

01:04:01.692 --> 01:04:04.761
Yes. The first time I tried it, I knew
there was something special there.

01:04:04.796 --> 01:04:09.211
- I have an instinct for these things.
- Wait until you taste Luke's food.

01:04:09.246 --> 01:04:11.847
It is incredible.
He actually bought Metro Tavern,

01:04:11.882 --> 01:04:15.350
although the name is gonna
be changing soon.

01:04:15.385 --> 01:04:16.819
Mom, why don't you
bring her in the kitchen

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:18.804
and have a sample
of tonight's menu?

01:04:18.839 --> 01:04:20.922
I'd love that.
I'm starving.

01:04:21.436 --> 01:04:24.025
- Wonderful idea. Follow me.
- See you soon.

01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:25.512
Alright, enjoy.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:30.280
OK, what is going on?
You said they just texted you.

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.212
Yeah, they did. But it was
to say that they're not coming.

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:37.138
Other than three people from
my restaurant, we have no servers.

01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:40.575
He apologized profusely,

01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:42.488
but said that they have us
booked for tomorrow night.

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:45.138
Yeah, despite three emails
from me all mentioning the date.

01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:47.327
And there's really no one
available at the last minute?

01:04:47.351 --> 01:04:50.485
Saturday night, party season.
Their people are all booked up.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:53.121
- I'll never use them again.
- We have a house full of people

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:55.957
coming and no one to pass
hors-d'oeuvres and serve food.

01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:59.060
I worked my way through
college as a waiter. I can help.

01:04:59.096 --> 01:05:01.074
Monica, we're not gonna let
you be on your feet all night.

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:04.165
Please, she still runs 3 miles
every day. She can handle it.

01:05:04.201 --> 01:05:06.820
And I can mix a mean drink,
so put me behind the bar.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:10.839
Thank you, really. I know you
wanted to enjoy the evening.

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:14.609
- We're family. It's what we do.
- We can ask Jim and Caylee.

01:05:14.645 --> 01:05:17.178
- I'm sure they'd help out, too.
- Okay, so that's four people,

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:18.697
but we were expecting
a lot more staff.

01:05:18.698 --> 01:05:21.616
Who's gonna man the food station?
Who's gonna serve?

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:26.488
- Hey, Beverly. Come in.
- Hey, Darcy.

01:05:26.523 --> 01:05:27.674
The kids are all here.

01:05:27.675 --> 01:05:30.425
We don't want to be in the way,
while you finish setting up,

01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:32.728
but they'd love to help if
there's anything we can do.

01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:39.134
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I hope so, 'cause my idea is brilliant.

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:53.615
Luke said...

01:05:53.650 --> 01:05:56.051
He said the kids' choir costumes
are perfect.

01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:59.988
It's a great fix. Honestly,
even better than hired help.

01:06:00.023 --> 01:06:03.209
It is, 'cause it's personal.
It means something,

01:06:03.244 --> 01:06:06.895
which is why I wanted them here.
Didn't expect to put them to work.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:09.698
No, they're just excited
to show their gratitude.

01:06:09.733 --> 01:06:13.001
- It's like it was meant to be.
- Yeah, it does feel that way.

01:06:13.036 --> 01:06:15.904
Kinda feels like I'm part
of something transformative.

01:06:15.939 --> 01:06:18.340
- I want to do more.
- Like what?

01:06:18.375 --> 01:06:21.409
I wanna work with people, not
just be part of the bottom line.

01:06:21.445 --> 01:06:24.012
- I wanna be of service.
- I can't think of anything...

01:06:24.047 --> 01:06:28.350
...more wonderful at Christmas,
than being of service.

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:31.079
Alright, we have to hurry up.
This thing is happening.

01:06:31.922 --> 01:06:33.553
It's happening.

01:07:26.977 --> 01:07:28.977
I look like a penguin, don't I?

01:07:29.744 --> 01:07:33.632
Not a penguin, more like...
more like James Bond.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:37.276
I'll accept that compliment, milady,
and raise you one.

01:07:38.108 --> 01:07:40.875
- Was that James Bond?
- Yes.

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:44.592
Very much so.
You look stunning.

01:07:46.194 --> 01:07:47.555
Thank you.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.609
So the kids are doing great.

01:07:50.644 --> 01:07:52.289
Guests are mingling, we're
plying them with food and drink

01:07:52.313 --> 01:07:53.780
and they're starting to bid
on the silent auction.

01:07:53.804 --> 01:07:56.037
Good. It's almost time
to unveil the trees.

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:58.807
I'll gather round the kids,
you find Charlene?

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.842
Sounds good.

01:08:10.448 --> 01:08:13.904
Mark! What are you doing here?
Listen, I've been calling you.

01:08:13.939 --> 01:08:16.616
I was with my family
at our cabin in the Poconos.

01:08:16.617 --> 01:08:18.893
I needed a few days to unplug.

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:21.496
Imagine my surprise
when I plugged back in.

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:24.732
- Sorry about all the messages.
- They weren't all yours.

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:27.801
I called your assistant and she
told me where I could find you.

01:08:28.332 --> 01:08:33.006
Now, integrity is crucial
when I choose anyone

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:36.511
to take care of any aspect of
my finances or my businesses.

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:39.581
I feel the same exact way.
Whatever Austin may have said...

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.850
I don't believe a word of it.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:44.319
Anyone who would treat
their partner that way...

01:08:45.116 --> 01:08:48.857
I don't care how many clients you have
and how big or small they may be.

01:08:48.892 --> 01:08:52.586
You've done your job.
And very well for me, at that.

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:55.697
I'm so happy to hear you say that.

01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:58.700
I'm gonna be selling them
my share.

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:02.604
We have a different vision,
my partners and I.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:06.207
I think this will be
the best thing for all of us.

01:09:06.243 --> 01:09:10.712
Well, then let me be clear.
Wherever you go, I'm with you.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.714
Thank you.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:25.966
- We're ready.
- Great. Looks like Sally Bassman's a fan.

01:09:26.002 --> 01:09:27.595
No, you have no idea.

01:09:27.631 --> 01:09:30.865
She wants to talk to me about
my restaurant as soon as possible.

01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:33.734
- Her words, not mine.
- That is incredible.

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:36.638
I actually have some big news, too.
Kind of life-altering.

01:09:37.504 --> 01:09:38.907
It's a long story.

01:09:38.942 --> 01:09:42.042
- As soon as we're done with this.
- OK. Well...

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:46.599
Good evening, everyone.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.575
My mother, Gloria Fitzwilliam,
has asked me to speak,

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:51.953
so, on behalf
of the Pemberley League,

01:09:51.988 --> 01:09:54.274
thank you so much for being
here tonight to celebrate

01:09:54.325 --> 01:09:57.959
...this wonderful cause.

01:10:01.291 --> 01:10:06.043
You know, Christmas isn't just a day
or a season; it's a state of mind.

01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:08.503
It's a time of giving and that's...

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:11.432
that's something I'd like to
hold onto throughout the year.

01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:15.231
When we see the tangible
impact we have on others,

01:10:15.266 --> 01:10:17.111
how can we not be moved?

01:10:17.147 --> 01:10:19.814
So I'm very proud
to introduce you

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:23.117
to Beverly Jensen and the
Pemberley Youth Center Choir.

01:10:23.153 --> 01:10:26.020
You may recognize them
as our servers tonight.

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:28.389
This was just a small way
they wanted to say thank you.

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:06.995
That was so beautiful.
So please, eat, drink, dance...

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:09.731
...and enjoy the beautiful trees,
custom designed...

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:15.203
...by local Pemberley interior
decorator, Charlene Johanson.

01:11:17.173 --> 01:11:20.537
And our live auction is set
to begin in one hour.

01:11:20.744 --> 01:11:23.711
Fabulous.

01:11:32.756 --> 01:11:36.157
You were great, absolutely great.
Thanks.

01:11:36.193 --> 01:11:39.123
- Hey.
- Hey. The kids are a hit.

01:11:39.158 --> 01:11:40.779
Happy accidents, right?

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:44.899
What are you two doing, standing here
while this beautiful Christmas music plays?

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:47.502
- Come on!
- Shall we?

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:51.306
Sure.

01:11:54.811 --> 01:11:58.008
- Tonight has been perfect.
- It has.

01:11:58.048 --> 01:12:01.483
This whole week, despite
the stress and the mishaps...

01:12:03.185 --> 01:12:05.127
it's given me a lot of clarity.

01:12:05.661 --> 01:12:08.721
- About?
- About what I want in my life.

01:12:08.756 --> 01:12:12.126
What really fills me up.
Being with my family

01:12:12.162 --> 01:12:16.898
and seeing my brother and
Monica take this next step and...

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:19.767
I've made a big decision
about something I want.

01:12:19.803 --> 01:12:24.205
- I'd love to hear it.
- I've decided...

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.241
There you are. Your
mother is looking for you.

01:12:28.733 --> 01:12:30.878
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah.

01:12:39.422 --> 01:12:43.591
Wait, where's my mom?
You said she needed me.

01:12:44.163 --> 01:12:47.261
I needed to talk to you.

01:12:48.157 --> 01:12:50.159
I tried to give you
some space, Darce.

01:12:50.194 --> 01:12:51.777
- There's so much I need to say.
- Carl...

01:12:51.801 --> 01:12:53.398
Please,
just let me get this out.

01:12:55.438 --> 01:12:57.072
I wasn't born yesterday.

01:12:57.073 --> 01:12:59.258
I see the way you look
at that Luke guy.

01:12:59.259 --> 01:13:03.049
That's not what you think.
Maybe. I don't know.

01:13:03.084 --> 01:13:07.417
What I do know is that
you and I fit, Darcy.

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:09.950
We're cut from the same cloth.

01:13:10.269 --> 01:13:13.237
We work in the same field,
we speak the same language.

01:13:13.272 --> 01:13:16.132
You and this Luke guy...

01:13:16.516 --> 01:13:20.627
Sure, he's nice, but...
you wouldn't be happy here.

01:13:21.066 --> 01:13:23.258
You're a New Yorker now.

01:13:24.121 --> 01:13:27.696
Your life is there.
Your business is there.

01:13:31.097 --> 01:13:32.789
And I'm there.

01:13:34.670 --> 01:13:36.344
And we work.

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:40.506
Let's go back to New York together,
like it's supposed to be.

01:13:42.552 --> 01:13:44.910
Carl, you are such good man,

01:13:48.074 --> 01:13:49.807
but it's not right.

01:13:49.826 --> 01:13:51.720
We're not right.

01:13:51.995 --> 01:13:55.196
Yes, the optics look great,

01:13:55.231 --> 01:13:58.857
but it needs to be more
than just a good fit.

01:13:59.661 --> 01:14:01.335
It has to be love.

01:14:01.371 --> 01:14:04.038
And I don't think that's
what you're feeling either.

01:14:05.793 --> 01:14:07.341
We could've been good together.

01:14:07.377 --> 01:14:10.678
We both deserve more
than just good.

01:14:12.367 --> 01:14:13.464
I...

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:17.145
I want you to be happy.
You know that, right?

01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.102
And I want the same for you.

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:29.697
I think I'm going to
go back to New York now.

01:14:37.294 --> 01:14:39.248
Merry Christmas, Darcy.

01:14:40.834 --> 01:14:42.565
Merry Christmas, Carl.

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:57.124
Hey, Jim,
can you keep an eye on things?

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:59.027
- I just need a minute.
- You okay?

01:14:59.062 --> 01:15:01.696
Yeah. Darcy just got back
with her ex.

01:15:02.493 --> 01:15:04.432
- What?
- I saw it with my own eyes.

01:15:04.467 --> 01:15:06.901
She said that she made
a big decision.

01:15:08.294 --> 01:15:09.788
I guess that was it.

01:15:09.806 --> 01:15:13.679
No way. That is not possible.
I need to go find her.

01:15:15.818 --> 01:15:17.799
It was never gonna work
anyway, right?

01:15:17.834 --> 01:15:21.816
You're gonna be OK. You're on
the verge of getting your dream.

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:23.910
Eyes on the prize, Luke.

01:15:25.185 --> 01:15:26.718
Yeah. You're right.

01:15:28.650 --> 01:15:31.698
I'm gonna get some air.
I'll be back in a few.

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:48.442
- Carl told you he's leaving?
- He wanted to assure me

01:15:48.478 --> 01:15:52.680
that none of this would impact
his job performance in any way.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.615
Of course.
He's a professional.

01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.111
He is.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.254
And he will remain at the helm
of my New York branch

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:04.091
until I find someone up to par
so I can finally retire.

01:16:04.127 --> 01:16:08.629
I know. I know.
It's not you.

01:16:12.003 --> 01:16:14.664
Dad, our family
means everything to me.

01:16:14.911 --> 01:16:21.440
You've taught me everything I know,
not just in business, but in life.

01:16:22.003 --> 01:16:24.107
I don't know if I've ever
thanked you for that.

01:16:24.803 --> 01:16:26.846
No thanks necessary.

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.103
You know,

01:16:30.247 --> 01:16:34.844
I think you got all of my strengths
and none of my weaknesses.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.128
So...

01:16:44.076 --> 01:16:46.714
what if we combined
the best of both of us?

01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:51.072
- What are you saying?
- Let's say I come on board.

01:16:51.844 --> 01:16:54.308
- We have no investment minimums.
- Done.

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:57.314
And I get to take on any
client I want, big or small.

01:16:57.349 --> 01:16:58.412
Absolutely.

01:16:58.448 --> 01:17:01.382
And we help small businesses
find the funding they need.

01:17:01.417 --> 01:17:04.720
We'll consider it a sort of angel
investment arm of the company.

01:17:04.755 --> 01:17:05.886
I like that.

01:17:05.922 --> 01:17:07.588
- And...
- There's more?

01:17:08.593 --> 01:17:10.992
We create
the Fitzwilliam Foundation.

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:13.628
Dedicated to philanthropy
in our community.

01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:17.431
We have fundraisers, we help people,
just like the Pemberley League does.

01:17:17.467 --> 01:17:19.467
You got a lot of demands,
young lady.

01:17:19.502 --> 01:17:22.791
- And they're all reasonable.
- And better than the last.

01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:28.331
- You've got a deal.
- I think we do.

01:17:28.366 --> 01:17:30.516
We're going to do
great things together.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.913
I already secured
a very big client tonight.

01:17:32.949 --> 01:17:35.616
I always knew I'd get you
back into my company,

01:17:35.652 --> 01:17:37.859
...one way or the other.

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:42.236
Thanks, Dad.

01:17:43.693 --> 01:17:47.128
- I love you.
- I love you, Dad.

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:54.625
Have you seen Luke?
None of the staff have seen him.

01:17:54.771 --> 01:17:58.081
No, but Carl just left a few
minutes ago looking pretty grim.

01:17:59.215 --> 01:18:00.415
Yeah, it's over.

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:03.537
- For real this time.
- I'm so sorry, Darcy.

01:18:03.572 --> 01:18:06.414
But there are so many fish
in that sea of New York City.

01:18:06.449 --> 01:18:08.360
There are fish everywhere.
You're gonna be fine.

01:18:08.384 --> 01:18:11.852
- Maybe even here in Pemberley.
- What?

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:15.256
- Are you thinking about staying?
- I have to go.

01:18:16.503 --> 01:18:17.721
What just happened?

01:18:18.061 --> 01:18:21.228
OK, everyone,
time for the tree auction!

01:18:24.534 --> 01:18:26.600
- Darce!
- Hi.

01:18:26.636 --> 01:18:29.336
- Did you get back with Carl?
- What? No!

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:31.305
- Where did you hear that?
- Luke.

01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:33.441
He saw you guys. He seemed
pretty upset about it.

01:18:33.476 --> 01:18:37.945
No... No, no, Carl and I
did not get back together.

01:18:39.537 --> 01:18:41.849
Luke is crazy about you, Darce.

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:44.552
- It's so obvious.
- But where is he?

01:18:44.587 --> 01:18:45.821
Nobody seems to know.

01:18:45.822 --> 01:18:48.609
He said he was going to get some air,
so we came out to look for him.

01:18:48.644 --> 01:18:50.491
We can't find him anywhere.

01:18:50.526 --> 01:18:53.661
- He wouldn't leave, would he?
- He'd never walk out on a job.

01:18:55.932 --> 01:18:57.832
Straight to voice mail.

01:18:57.867 --> 01:19:00.534
OK, can you guys please
keep looking out here?

01:19:00.570 --> 01:19:04.004
I'm gonna look inside. I have
to find him. I have to tell him.

01:19:04.040 --> 01:19:08.342
- Tell him what?
- That I'm crazy about him, too.

01:19:12.636 --> 01:19:14.749
I have a bid of $1,700,

01:19:14.784 --> 01:19:18.252
looking for 1750.
Come on, folks, look at this.

01:19:18.287 --> 01:19:22.089
It's a Colorado blue spruce,
come on!

01:19:22.125 --> 01:19:25.826
- Everything OK, Darce?
- Yeah. Everything's perfect.

01:19:25.862 --> 01:19:28.496
- I'm loving these high bids.
- I know!

01:19:35.972 --> 01:19:38.539
- I've looked everywhere.
- He's not calling back, either.

01:19:38.574 --> 01:19:40.775
I have to find him and
bring him back here.

01:19:40.810 --> 01:19:43.844
- You want me to go?
- No. It should be me.

01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:46.258
Take my car. Hurry back. We'll
cover for you while you're gone.

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:48.682
OK. Thank you.

01:19:56.626 --> 01:19:57.626
Where are you going?

01:20:00.183 --> 01:20:01.824
You can't leave your own party.

01:20:03.989 --> 01:20:07.583
Where have you been?
We've all been looking for you.

01:20:07.670 --> 01:20:10.361
Talking to Sally Bassman
by her car.

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:15.983
I ran into her outside,
offered to walk her to her driver.

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:22.550
Then, she wanted to talk about
the restaurant. About investing.

01:20:22.585 --> 01:20:25.619
- That's great news.
- Yeah.

01:20:27.757 --> 01:20:30.157
Looks like we've both had
a pretty monumental night.

01:20:30.193 --> 01:20:32.126
No.

01:20:32.161 --> 01:20:36.297
I mean, yes,
it's been great, but it...

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:39.033
hasn't been monumental
in the way you think.

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:44.139
You didn't get back together
with Carl?

01:20:44.141 --> 01:20:47.135
No. How could I when...

01:20:48.356 --> 01:20:51.165
How could I when my heart
belongs to someone else?

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:55.316
Someone who's fun and kind
and generous,

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.675
who makes me laugh and...

01:20:58.855 --> 01:21:00.959
who showed me what it is to...

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:03.178
actually be a part of a team.

01:21:05.061 --> 01:21:08.696
- You forgot handsome.
- Yes, incredibly.

01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:11.175
Incredibly handsome.

01:21:12.668 --> 01:21:16.019
OK, so now that I know the
news wasn't about Carl...

01:21:16.054 --> 01:21:17.447
No, it wasn't.

01:21:17.448 --> 01:21:23.043
The news is I'm selling my shares
and I'm staying in Pemberley.

01:21:23.079 --> 01:21:26.480
I'm gonna work with my dad,
but on my terms.

01:21:26.515 --> 01:21:29.116
That sounds like the
best of both worlds.

01:21:29.151 --> 01:21:31.483
Yeah.
I think in Pemberley, I...

01:21:32.822 --> 01:21:35.022
I think I found
the best of all worlds.

01:21:38.995 --> 01:21:43.014
Look at that. You're up.
I hope you're prepared.

01:21:43.049 --> 01:21:44.884
- Darcy, I'm...
- Come on...

01:21:44.901 --> 01:21:47.001
Totally prepared.

01:21:47.002 --> 01:21:50.884
In ancient Roman times, enemies at
war would reconcile their differences

01:21:50.941 --> 01:21:52.801
underneath the mistletoe so they...

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.996
I didn't really wanna hear
the whole explanation.

01:22:03.319 --> 01:22:05.750
It's just a good tradition.
