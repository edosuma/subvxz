WEBVTT

02:01.705 --> 02:06.418
with a knife in a hand

02:25.104 --> 02:30.776
with a knife in a hand

02:31.277 --> 02:36.073
of battles past

02:36.991 --> 02:42.246
catching me and that's bad

03:07.730 --> 03:08.731
Take it off.

03:08.898 --> 03:11.233
I've always wanted
to fuck in this thing.

03:17.156 --> 03:18.157
Wait.

03:19.325 --> 03:20.492
Do you listen?

03:20.701 --> 03:22.912
We're literally the only people
on this fucking rock.

03:22.995 --> 03:24.038
Baby.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.790
Baby, the world is ours.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.379
"Enchanté"?
What is that, French?

03:34.048 --> 03:35.883
What the fuck?
-

03:38.052 --> 03:39.929
Another ship in orbit.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.764
Something is here.

03:42.598 --> 03:43.849
There's nothing there.

03:43.933 --> 03:44.850
Look.

03:45.601 --> 03:46.602
Hello?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.729
Hello?

03:50.105 --> 03:51.065
Hello?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.526
Show you more.

04:10.501 --> 04:11.585
See, babe?

04:12.336 --> 04:15.589
We're 100% absolutely alone.

04:26.767 --> 04:27.977
Stay there.

04:39.530 --> 04:40.531
Felix.

04:41.615 --> 04:42.533
Felix?

04:53.585 --> 04:54.586
Felix?

04:59.550 --> 05:01.844
- Niro, you up there?

05:01.927 --> 05:03.220
:
Loud and clear. What?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.763
: Put me through
to the Alliance Command

05:04.847 --> 05:06.056
this is an emergency.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.892
This is Captain Juda Sayle
of the Vander Corp

05:08.976 --> 05:11.311
mining vessel 4217.

05:11.395 --> 05:14.231
I need to report
an FC incident.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.401
Repeat, I need to report
an FC incident.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.362
:
This is Alliance Command.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.114
Did you say an FC incident?

05:22.197 --> 05:23.240
Correct.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.910
I think it's the first contact.

05:27.745 --> 05:30.247
: Captain, it is
crucial you answer the following

05:30.330 --> 05:33.917
was the contact positive
or negative for both species?

05:34.001 --> 05:37.546
Um... our security officer

05:38.088 --> 05:40.007
uh, uh, uh, he's shot.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.467
Uh, uh, uh...

05:42.968 --> 05:45.262
: Was first contact
positive or negative?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.972
Positive or negative?

06:11.663 --> 06:12.873
:
Six years running

06:12.956 --> 06:14.416
you can't ever be on time
for Thanksgiving.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.460
I can't solve everybody's
goddamn problems.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.212
Why do you even bother saying
you're coming home?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.713
I got another call
coming through.

06:19.797 --> 06:21.423
- Go for Ryle.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.509
: Sir, there's been an
incident on a Vander--

06:23.592 --> 06:24.718
Handle it.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.431
It's my one fuckin' night off
all year. What is it?

06:29.515 --> 06:31.892
A credible FC encounter
was just reported.

06:33.644 --> 06:34.645
Come again?

06:34.728 --> 06:37.231
Survivors of the encounter are
en route to McMillian Airfield.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.899
What are your orders, sir?

06:38.982 --> 06:40.818
I want you to tell
Commander Tieve

06:40.901 --> 06:42.653
to contact Dr Lea Goss.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.904
Do you understand me?

06:43.987 --> 06:44.988
Listen to me.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.619
Get me James Ford.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.162
Sir?
- You heard me.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.332
Get him to the base,
tell no one.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.917
I'm 40 minutes out. Do it.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.710
- Copy that.

07:15.144 --> 07:18.897
a price for illusion

07:18.981 --> 07:22.609
when you close your eyes

07:22.693 --> 07:26.113
and it says illusion

07:26.196 --> 07:30.117
am I under your feet

07:43.714 --> 07:44.965
Thanks for meeting me.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.593
I got a job for you.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.720
Cash.

07:51.013 --> 07:53.098
Quick job.
But it's on--

07:53.182 --> 07:55.225
Good evening, General.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.518
Oh, wait.

07:57.019 --> 08:00.105
You're just a civilian now,
like the rest of us, ain't you?

08:00.981 --> 08:04.693
See, the boys and I prefer
not to share your company.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.655
So if you could kindly take your
murderous ass someplace else

08:08.864 --> 08:10.157
we'd really appreciate it.

08:11.867 --> 08:15.704
Once upon a time, you were
a big bad motherfucker

08:15.871 --> 08:17.122
but now...

08:17.789 --> 08:19.082
But now?

08:25.380 --> 08:27.090
Uh, come on, fellas.
Fellas, fellas.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.450
-

09:18.183 --> 09:20.310
Get out, boys,
while you're still alive.

09:27.442 --> 09:30.070
- Mr James Ford.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.031
Ruining another Friday night
for all.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.831
What?
When I hear music, I dance

09:40.914 --> 09:42.791
and tonight, the universe
is singing a tune

09:42.874 --> 09:44.543
that will change everything.

09:45.294 --> 09:46.962
God, you still talk so much.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.755
Oh, well, you're listening.

09:48.839 --> 09:50.048
How you doing, Dash?

09:50.132 --> 09:51.258
Oh, I'm good.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.635
Hmm. Are you still living
in the shadows

09:53.719 --> 09:55.429
of your old commander?

09:55.637 --> 09:57.139
Hey, man, half the world
wants to fight him

09:57.222 --> 09:58.890
the other half wants
to buy him a drink

09:58.974 --> 10:01.018
so either way,
I come out on top.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.478
I'll take that as a "yes".

10:05.314 --> 10:08.900
Uh, Mr Ford, General Ryle
is requesting

10:08.984 --> 10:11.862
your inimitable counsel

10:12.237 --> 10:14.573
for a situation
that may change the cosmos

10:14.656 --> 10:17.242
as we humble cavemen know them.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.956
No.

10:23.040 --> 10:24.249
No?

10:24.583 --> 10:27.669
Well, let nobody accuse you
of being a poet.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.755
He needs you.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.215
The whole world needs you.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.508
Well...

10:34.384 --> 10:36.136
the world needs something.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.681
They made it clear
that it's not me.

10:42.559 --> 10:45.562
Si vis pacem, para bellum.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.065
The last time I heard
that saying

10:48.231 --> 10:50.400
you used it as an excuse
to justify dropping

10:50.484 --> 10:53.153
a Q-bomb on 70 million souls.

10:54.863 --> 10:58.325
I was following orders
from the Alliance.

10:58.408 --> 11:02.996
Orders you issued to yourself,
hmm?

11:03.830 --> 11:06.375
But guess what Ryle
told the Alliance Senate?

11:07.376 --> 11:08.835
You want peace

11:10.837 --> 11:11.963
you get ready for war.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.717
He's offered to reinstate you.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.482
Hey, we're sort
of a package deal now

11:30.565 --> 11:32.317
so, here you go.

11:32.651 --> 11:33.610
Thank you.

11:33.693 --> 11:34.820
Pay my tab.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.030
Drinks are on Marcus, thank you.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.156
Have a good night.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.117
: Make sure he knows
we're serious.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.579
Charming.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.723
:
Situation status, Defcon 4.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.350
All hands to the stations...

12:05.892 --> 12:09.563
: Um, uh, I mean,
he shot our security officer.

12:09.896 --> 12:12.274
H-he shot... um, uh.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.484
-

12:16.403 --> 12:18.071
Are you kidding me?

12:18.155 --> 12:19.364
Oh, shit.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.199
What is he doing here?

12:21.283 --> 12:23.535
Relax, you two.
Play nice.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.996
Ryle simply wants you to advise.

12:28.039 --> 12:31.668
I can't give advice
if I don't know the situation.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.961
Where is Ryle?

12:33.044 --> 12:35.130
Incoming, to protect us.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.215
Protect us from what?

12:40.093 --> 12:41.470
Possible first contact.

12:43.889 --> 12:45.849
It wasn't SETI, it wasn't NASA

12:45.932 --> 12:48.810
just a couple of roughnecks
bumping uglies in the boonies.

12:52.063 --> 12:53.231
Is this real?

12:53.648 --> 12:54.816
I think so.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.818
It feels real.

12:57.903 --> 13:01.364
Well, I mean,
this changes everything.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.366
They say that
about a lot of things

13:03.450 --> 13:05.535
but I still pay my taxes
and the sun still rises

13:05.619 --> 13:06.703
so let's see.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.705
Hey, you guys, uh,
you seem kinda chill about this.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.373
Do you not
understand the implications

13:10.457 --> 13:11.750
of this first contact?

13:11.833 --> 13:14.711
We may not be alone
in the universe.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.006
Do you think aliens have music?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.674
Do you think they dance?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.927
Do you think
they pay your bar tab?

13:23.053 --> 13:25.430
: The Vandermeer is dropping
out of quant space.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.765
Landing in Bay 3.

13:26.848 --> 13:29.100
: Right now,
you're on the proverbial bench.

13:29.184 --> 13:31.394
Ryle might call you up
for a Hail Mary.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.647
So, you know the drill.

13:34.648 --> 13:36.107
Hurry up and wait.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.111
One thing.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.613
If I were you

13:42.030 --> 13:46.326
prepare a Q-bomb.
Immediately.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.629
Go for Sergeant Locke.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.340
Give me a quant tech.

14:00.590 --> 14:01.675
Now.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.271
:
Hi, baby! I missed you.

14:15.647 --> 14:17.232
Did you miss me?

14:17.732 --> 14:19.651
Yeah, you did.
Mwah!

14:19.734 --> 14:21.486
: Hey, wrench!
- Who's a good boy?

14:21.945 --> 14:23.363
Hold up!
- Oh, no.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.948
No, no, no, no, no.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.533
Leave's been cancelled.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.703
Come on, Sarge,
don't do this to me!

14:29.786 --> 14:32.372
You're in the parking lot,
you're on base

14:32.455 --> 14:34.416
means you're still on duty.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.334
We got some secret
squirrel shit goin' on

14:36.501 --> 14:38.753
and they need a wrench
who can work the quant port.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.921
Hey.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.965
I'm callin' you wrench
cos you're an engineer.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.801
Well, I have plans
with friends.

14:45.927 --> 14:47.804
Your only friend
is the Alliance.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.847
Well, now, you see

14:48.930 --> 14:50.473
if I actually got
the leave I was promised

14:50.557 --> 14:52.809
I could, you know, have a life.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.020
I mean, what do they need
a quant tech for

14:55.103 --> 14:56.271
at 1:00am anyway?

14:56.354 --> 14:58.982
How the hell do I know?
It's above our pay-grade

14:59.524 --> 15:02.152
but I did see old man Ford
on deck, so...

15:03.278 --> 15:04.321
What do you want me to do?

15:04.362 --> 15:06.197
You want me to tell 'em
I couldn't get to you

15:06.281 --> 15:07.574
before you left?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.913
Wow.
What happened to your friends?

15:15.624 --> 15:18.585
With all due respect, Sarge,
fuck you.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.815
:
Quant port failure.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.485
Error code GR-76.

15:44.152 --> 15:47.197
Yeah, you couldn't be easy,
could you, Johnny?

15:48.156 --> 15:49.741
Who the hell is Johnny?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.577
Oh, it's Johnny Q,
the quant port.

15:52.661 --> 15:53.828
Yeah, I get it.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.455
How much time do you need?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.457
Uh... ten?

15:57.540 --> 15:58.625
You got five.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.752
Well, I'm gonna need ten.

16:01.169 --> 16:04.589
Fine, Ryle just sent you
the authorisation codes.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.675
Alrighty.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.181
:
Q-bomb generation authorised.

16:14.307 --> 16:19.020
Uh, sir...
what do they need a Q-bomb for?

16:20.063 --> 16:21.773
To jump-start a car.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.233
How the hell should I know?

16:23.983 --> 16:26.152
Should be on a beach
drinkin' a mai tai.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.030
This is just a drill, right?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.287
More than likely.

16:55.181 --> 16:58.601
OK, she should be ready
in 15 minutes.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.228
What happened to ten?

17:00.729 --> 17:02.439
:
Is what it is, Sarge.

17:02.731 --> 17:05.150
: The Vandermeer
is landing in Bay 6.

17:05.734 --> 17:07.235
Let's go.
-

17:36.222 --> 17:38.308
No smoking behind
the wire, specialist.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.392
Yes, sir.

17:39.476 --> 17:42.145
I don't give a damn if your
uncle is our boss or not.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.646
Just enjoyin' the view, sir.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.193
The hell's happenin',
by the way?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.695
I couldn't tell you
even if I knew.

17:50.779 --> 17:52.322
So they cancelled
our leave this weekend

17:52.405 --> 17:54.032
just so we could
play rent-a-cop?

17:54.365 --> 17:55.867
It's locals weekend
at the titty bar, sir

17:55.950 --> 17:56.868
you could've came with.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.996
I've told you this
a thousand times.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.458
: Sacrifice is the
currency of soldiering.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.335
Quit bein' a smart ass.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.879
Yes, sir.
Just doin' the job.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.258
Fine.

18:13.384 --> 18:14.886
You know what the hell's
goin' on?

18:14.969 --> 18:17.096
We're about to find out.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.640
:
Where are they going?

18:18.973 --> 18:20.767
Contamination protocol.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.769
Fuck that, we don't have time.

18:44.958 --> 18:46.751
I need to interview
the survivors immediately.

18:46.835 --> 18:47.752
Every second that passes--

18:47.836 --> 18:49.629
Statute four,
paragraph three states

18:49.671 --> 18:51.297
"Decontamination protocol
must be--"

18:51.381 --> 18:52.298
:
Protocol?

18:52.382 --> 18:55.134
It is protocol to contact
the senate at first contact.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.679
I'm guessing Ryle wants to know
what we're facing

18:57.762 --> 18:59.430
before he starts to panic.

18:59.514 --> 19:01.266
And I need to determine
whether first contact

19:01.349 --> 19:04.185
was a net positive or negative
for either species

19:04.269 --> 19:06.688
while the events are still fresh
in their minds.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.940
Let me do my job.

19:18.908 --> 19:20.410
Ryle's three minutes out.

19:25.999 --> 19:27.542
Why aren't you back
at your post?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.089
What's goin' on here?

19:33.172 --> 19:34.716
Eyes open, mouth shut.

19:57.071 --> 19:58.865
Are you OK?
-

19:58.948 --> 19:59.866
Hey.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.960
-

20:18.718 --> 20:19.636
Fuck.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.227
Hands in the air.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.854
Hands in the air!
- Don't shoot!

20:29.938 --> 20:32.523
:
Cease advancing or I will shoot.

20:32.815 --> 20:33.900
Fuck this.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.862
That's a fucking soldier.
Back, Doc!

20:37.946 --> 20:39.364
Out! Out!

20:51.834 --> 20:53.461
Aim for the eyes!
Aim for the eyes!

20:53.670 --> 20:54.796
Back, back, back!

21:04.639 --> 21:06.265
:
What do you think you're doing?

21:06.349 --> 21:08.434
The bitch spit acid
and melted a face!

21:08.518 --> 21:10.019
What the fuck was that?

21:10.103 --> 21:11.270
Hostiles are on the base.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.982
I repeat,
hostiles are on the base.

21:14.816 --> 21:16.150
Let me out!

21:16.234 --> 21:17.402
:
I'm so sorry.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.779
Let me the fuck out!
- I'm so sorry!

21:21.948 --> 21:23.908
-

21:25.618 --> 21:27.203
:
Braxton, hold your position.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.166
Doc, get out of there,
get out of the way!

21:45.430 --> 21:46.848
:
Amazing.

21:47.015 --> 21:49.308
Amazing? What, do you wanna
fuck it or kill it?

21:56.566 --> 21:58.359
Doc, move!
- Do not engage!

21:58.443 --> 21:59.861
I'm makin'
an executive decision.

22:19.505 --> 22:20.506
:
We go now!

22:22.216 --> 22:23.259
Go, go, go!

22:25.678 --> 22:27.346
-

22:31.684 --> 22:32.852
Where's the arsenal?

22:32.935 --> 22:34.812
About three hangars
down that way, sir.

22:35.688 --> 22:37.565
Ford, what the fuck
are you doing?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.196
Don't be a hero.

22:46.783 --> 22:47.909
:
Move, move!

22:48.576 --> 22:49.911
:
Watch out for the blood!

22:49.994 --> 22:51.579
Stay away from the blood!

22:51.662 --> 22:52.705
Sir?

22:53.122 --> 22:54.791
No!

22:55.333 --> 22:56.501
It's a fucking bloodbath!

22:56.626 --> 22:58.419
Alright, that's it,
I'm calling it.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.631
Oh, he's here.
He's here!

23:01.839 --> 23:03.257
:
Lockdown in effect.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.010
General Ryle, sir.
- The fuck is happening?

23:06.094 --> 23:07.595
The aliens are camouflaged
as survivors

23:07.720 --> 23:09.097
of the Vander, sir.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.264
Put the base on lockdown.

23:10.348 --> 23:11.516
Yes, sir.
- No one gets out.

23:11.599 --> 23:12.683
Where's Ford?

23:12.767 --> 23:15.186
Sir, the last time I saw him,
he was headed to the arsenal.

23:15.478 --> 23:16.562
Fuck.

23:25.029 --> 23:26.155
Whoa.

24:07.321 --> 24:09.866
They're goin' after the Vander.
They're tryin' to escape.

24:20.293 --> 24:21.294
You're OK.

24:22.295 --> 24:23.880
Alright, just relax.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.173
Put some pressure.

24:26.132 --> 24:27.675
I don't wanna turn
into one of them.

24:27.758 --> 24:29.093
Breathe.
- No, I'm scared.

24:29.177 --> 24:30.803
I'm so scared.
- Alright, I got you.

24:30.887 --> 24:31.929
Don't be scared.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.556
Don't be scared,
don't fall apart on me, OK?

24:33.639 --> 24:34.515
I need you.

24:34.599 --> 24:35.641
They don't just die.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.101
OK.
- They're inside of me.

24:37.185 --> 24:38.644
I can feel one going--
- Listen to me!

24:41.314 --> 24:42.690
Take this weapon.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.775
And you get yourself back in
that fight.

24:44.859 --> 24:45.943
You hear me?

25:22.438 --> 25:24.690
This is across the front, sir.
- How many are left?

25:24.774 --> 25:26.025
Four of them, sir.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.777
Where's Braxton?
- In the shit, sir.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.528
Get east, get closer,
lock it up.

25:29.612 --> 25:31.322
:
Move, move, move, move!

25:37.662 --> 25:39.622
The electronic pulser field.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.082
I'll do it manually.

25:42.124 --> 25:43.459
Cover my six.

25:48.923 --> 25:49.840
Fuck!

25:49.924 --> 25:51.050
The Sarge is down.

25:51.133 --> 25:53.636
I repeat, the Sarge is down.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.346
I need medevac!

25:55.429 --> 25:57.014
Come on, you gotta do something!

25:57.265 --> 25:58.975
I'm a doctor, not a god.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.187
He was right,
don't let 'em out!

26:03.646 --> 26:05.189
:
Know how to use that thing?

26:05.940 --> 26:07.441
:
OK, lay down cover!

26:26.669 --> 26:27.962
Door's not closing!

26:56.198 --> 26:58.200
:
Silence protocol activated.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.287
They figured out how
to use our weapons in seconds.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.873
I mean, it's a good thing
we were there to save the day.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.541
Shut up, Dash.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.628
The good news, uh,
we got our bloodwork back

27:09.712 --> 27:11.422
and there are no anomalies.

27:11.922 --> 27:13.632
The death toll is still at 53.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.264
From the top.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.477
Four hours ago,
the crew of the Vander

27:24.560 --> 27:27.313
made first contact
in the Heracles system.

27:27.688 --> 27:29.231
They believe we're hostile.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.610
: The Alliance Senate
is requesting an update.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.028
Tell 'em I'm on it.

27:34.111 --> 27:37.031
And now the politicians are
stuck debating the next move?

27:37.531 --> 27:39.408
You know what to do now.

27:39.492 --> 27:40.868
No, I don't.

27:42.036 --> 27:42.995
But she may.

27:44.246 --> 27:45.706
Some years back,
a First Lieutenant

27:45.790 --> 27:48.542
wrote a thesis
on behavioural biology.

27:49.877 --> 27:50.836
Please.

27:54.131 --> 27:58.094
"To kill a culture is to kill
the very idea of creation.

27:58.969 --> 28:02.556
It is a sin against the cosmos
to wipe out a civilisation.

28:03.015 --> 28:05.893
But we often forget that liberty
is not given

28:05.976 --> 28:07.478
liberty is gained.

28:08.104 --> 28:10.106
And in the event
of first contact

28:10.189 --> 28:12.274
humanity must strike first

28:12.733 --> 28:15.903
to ensure the continued survival
of our species."

28:17.863 --> 28:19.615
Just for the record,
I was 25

28:19.907 --> 28:21.826
when I wrote that
as a thought exercise

28:22.034 --> 28:24.495
not as a blueprint for genocide.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.166
However,
the facts are still true.

28:29.667 --> 28:30.584
But what if--

28:30.668 --> 28:32.086
:
We don't have time for what if.

28:32.169 --> 28:33.671
What happened up there
between the Vander

28:33.754 --> 28:35.923
and this alien force
has set this in motion.

28:36.006 --> 28:39.093
Operation Cosmic Sin
is now a go.

28:39.802 --> 28:41.846
We're not gonna wait for them
to bring the fight to us

28:41.929 --> 28:43.389
we're gonna take it to them.

28:44.181 --> 28:45.474
Better them than us.

28:45.558 --> 28:47.726
: But we must consider
that the force

28:47.810 --> 28:49.603
that was met with the crew
at the Vandermeer

28:49.687 --> 28:50.855
was a...

28:51.147 --> 28:53.732
rogue faction of their species.
- OK.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.359
Like the separatists at Safdie.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.777
Alien terrorists?

28:56.861 --> 28:57.987
Alright, enough.
- A faction that--

28:58.070 --> 28:59.405
Enough, enough, enough.

29:00.364 --> 29:01.365
Enough.

29:01.866 --> 29:03.409
Do you see these stars?

29:06.370 --> 29:07.496
You're dismissed.

29:07.580 --> 29:08.581
Thank you.

29:22.845 --> 29:24.263
Not easy, is it?

29:25.973 --> 29:27.057
What's that?

29:27.892 --> 29:30.060
Giving orders
is a lot harder

29:30.144 --> 29:32.771
than followin' 'em, right?

29:35.441 --> 29:37.610
If I do this,
you're gonna restore

29:37.693 --> 29:41.030
my... my rank and my pension.

29:41.947 --> 29:43.574
:
Let me ask you a question.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.576
You really think you got
what it takes

29:45.659 --> 29:46.994
to get this job done?

29:47.369 --> 29:49.079
:
Ask me that again.

29:50.206 --> 29:51.499
I dare you.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.048
:
Hold it.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.257
Stop!

30:00.424 --> 30:02.343
: Communication
with Ellora unavailable.

30:02.426 --> 30:03.802
Please remain calm.

30:08.557 --> 30:11.227
Medevacs requested
for west gate.

30:11.685 --> 30:14.230
Medevacs requested
for west gate.

30:30.829 --> 30:31.789
Take him.

30:37.461 --> 30:38.420
:
Fuck!

30:48.847 --> 30:50.474
-

30:58.399 --> 30:59.400
You're goin' after them,
aren't you--

30:59.483 --> 31:00.985
Don't even ask.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.736
Sir, I have every right
to be on this mission.

31:02.820 --> 31:04.780
I was the first one
to kill one of those things.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.198
I heard it was a lucky shot.

31:06.282 --> 31:09.076
All of our shots
are lucky shots, sir.

31:09.159 --> 31:11.453
You have put in for leave.
You're dismissed.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.122
I'm not leaving, sir,
put me in the fight!

31:13.205 --> 31:14.164
You!

31:17.668 --> 31:19.670
Are dismissed, specialist.

31:20.963 --> 31:22.381
Sir, this isn't fair.

31:22.881 --> 31:23.799
Fair?

31:24.383 --> 31:26.969
You are my responsibility, mine.

31:27.636 --> 31:29.305
Don't talk to me about fair.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.389
Take him to the brig.

31:30.472 --> 31:31.473
Wait, wait.

31:33.309 --> 31:35.227
You would send them off to war

31:36.228 --> 31:38.105
but you wouldn't send
your own family?

31:44.612 --> 31:45.613
Don't fuck this up.

31:51.869 --> 31:52.911
Let him go!

32:44.713 --> 32:46.090
It's somethin', huh?

32:52.012 --> 32:54.890
We didn't know whether to
burn it or put it in a museum.

32:55.557 --> 32:58.143
I'm sure they said
the same thing about me.

33:01.939 --> 33:05.234
: Quant fuel loaded.
Quant fuel loaded.

33:07.027 --> 33:08.028
:
Arms up.

33:08.987 --> 33:09.947
Ready now.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.951
:
Icarus suit ready.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.453
Icarus suit ready.

33:19.540 --> 33:22.501
OK, so the Icarus suits
are rated for terra

33:22.710 --> 33:24.670
orbital and quantum warfare.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.047
Hey, who do you think I am?

33:27.589 --> 33:28.966
Ford's drinking buddy.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.552
You never heard
of the Red Rider of Puja

33:31.635 --> 33:32.970
the Slayer of Eos?

33:33.053 --> 33:35.431
Hmm, must have been
before my time.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.476
How did that feel?

33:39.727 --> 33:40.936
You should know.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.232
A question about the objective

33:45.441 --> 33:47.192
do we know
where their homeworld is?

33:47.276 --> 33:49.319
No, we do not.
Until we get those coordinates

33:49.403 --> 33:51.864
we play defense
right into Ellora.

33:52.489 --> 33:54.658
An Alliance battalion force
on Ellora

33:54.742 --> 33:56.076
shot down one of their ships.

33:56.160 --> 33:57.327
Yeah, we find these ships

33:57.411 --> 33:59.830
we track the radiation
right back to their homeworld.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.331
:
We may not speak their language

34:01.415 --> 34:03.459
but math and physics
are generally consistent

34:03.542 --> 34:04.877
throughout the universe.
- Right.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.212
: I mean, radiation
is how we map the stars

34:07.296 --> 34:08.672
in the first place.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.716
This could work.

34:10.883 --> 34:12.718
OK.
We good?

34:12.885 --> 34:14.261
: Good.
- Let's go.

34:26.398 --> 34:27.524
Sir.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.194
Uh, during the attack

34:30.277 --> 34:32.905
I picked up on a large amount
of tachyon interference.

34:32.988 --> 34:36.283
I think it came
from one of them.

34:43.499 --> 34:45.083
I-I mean, a pulse that size

34:45.209 --> 34:47.044
anyone with the right equipment
could track it

34:47.127 --> 34:50.464
and... find us
within six or seven hours.

34:50.798 --> 34:53.634
So... they know where we are.

34:54.510 --> 34:55.969
Q-bomb, please.

34:59.431 --> 35:00.808
I mean, sir,
you have to understand

35:00.891 --> 35:02.351
this is very unstable.

35:02.476 --> 35:03.852
I mean, you knock it
the wrong way

35:03.936 --> 35:06.396
and it could take out everything
from here to Pluto.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.067
We'll handle it with care.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.528
This is a last resort though,
right?

35:12.653 --> 35:14.905
Oh, yes.
Of course.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.450
Shit.

35:19.201 --> 35:20.702
You, suit up.

35:20.786 --> 35:21.662
Whoa.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.247
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
sir, respectfully--

35:23.330 --> 35:26.375
: We need a tech
to handle this Q-bomb.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.169
Are you up to it?

35:29.670 --> 35:32.965
Has the Alliance Senate
approved any of this?

35:33.382 --> 35:34.883
The aliens are tryin' to kill us

35:35.008 --> 35:36.885
and we're stealing WMDs

35:36.969 --> 35:39.972
and you're asking if
any of this is legal?

35:40.597 --> 35:41.974
:
Let's put it this way.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.433
Either way this works out

35:43.767 --> 35:46.186
it's gonna be on the wrong side
of history.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.024
Suit up.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.518
Mankind mastered ballistics

36:26.602 --> 36:28.937
and their species
mastered biology.

36:30.314 --> 36:31.648
:
Are you scared...

36:32.900 --> 36:34.109
or impressed?

36:34.192 --> 36:35.319
:
Both.

36:36.653 --> 36:39.197
I wonder if their hosts'
consciousness survived

36:39.281 --> 36:41.158
any of the metamorphosis.

36:41.241 --> 36:43.660
I mean, a larva
that turns into a butterfly

36:43.744 --> 36:45.329
has the same soul.

36:46.038 --> 36:47.331
Just changed.

36:49.416 --> 36:52.836
Well, my forced
little retirement.

36:54.171 --> 36:55.672
Dishonourable discharge.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.759
It's given me a lot
to think about.

36:58.842 --> 37:00.093
What's there to think about?

37:00.344 --> 37:02.930
I mean, you wanna
catch a baseball game?

37:03.013 --> 37:04.139
Get high?

37:05.432 --> 37:07.100
I didn't think it was all bad.

37:07.476 --> 37:08.644
It wasn't.

37:09.186 --> 37:10.270
But?

37:11.897 --> 37:14.524
You wanted to be a soldier
more than a husband.

37:18.111 --> 37:20.989
The older I get,
the more I just...

37:25.452 --> 37:27.663
I wanna watch the stars
with someone.

37:28.038 --> 37:30.707
Well, if there's still a bar
standing at the end of all this

37:31.458 --> 37:33.085
I guess you could buy me
a drink.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.689
You ever do a quant jump before?

37:54.231 --> 37:55.774
Uh...
-

37:55.857 --> 37:57.150
Not even for fun?

38:00.570 --> 38:03.073
Look, just tell me we're
gonna teleport and not explode.

38:03.156 --> 38:05.742
Well, Johnny here
doesn't so much teleport you

38:05.826 --> 38:07.661
as he rips a hole
in space-time

38:07.744 --> 38:09.621
and then sort of kicks you
through the other side.

38:09.705 --> 38:11.498
So, as long as there's no
tachyon interference

38:11.581 --> 38:12.916
we should be fine.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.253
And, uh, what if there is?

38:17.295 --> 38:19.798
Oh, well,
then things will get, um...

38:21.049 --> 38:22.134
interesting.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.263
Should've stayed at the bar.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.558
Well, it's just quantum
displacement, it's...

38:30.267 --> 38:31.977
It's not like
it's rocket science.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.189
Ready for glory or death,
General?

38:37.149 --> 38:39.067
I'm ready
to get the fuck out of here.

38:39.401 --> 38:42.029
Quite the cast of villains
you've assembled here.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.155
Makes me wonder if--

38:43.238 --> 38:45.991
Careful before you finish
that comment, Commander.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.286
Your first instinct
at first contact

38:49.369 --> 38:51.830
made you call for
the Blood General.

38:52.456 --> 38:53.665
What's your point?

38:54.332 --> 38:56.043
Well, many a wise soul has said

38:56.126 --> 38:59.296
"We see ourselves reflected
in others."

39:01.590 --> 39:04.259
He's a warmonger,
but he's our fuckin' warmonger.

39:04.384 --> 39:06.053
I'm not talking about Ford

39:06.386 --> 39:08.055
I'm talking about the enemy.

39:09.681 --> 39:10.724
You know, many years ago

39:10.807 --> 39:12.100
I was late
for a flight assignment

39:12.184 --> 39:13.852
and Ford broke my nose.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.021
I was never late again.

39:16.104 --> 39:17.230
Yeah, Pavlovian.

39:17.314 --> 39:20.025
Yeah, we're gonna hit him,
we're gonna hit him hard

39:20.108 --> 39:21.818
before this war ever starts.

39:26.490 --> 39:29.409
Ryle. The boy can fight.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.540
I go down--
- : You won't.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.751
If I do...

39:38.502 --> 39:39.628
Like family.

39:48.720 --> 39:51.723
The old suit's a little tight.

39:52.766 --> 39:53.767
Yeah.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.645
Needs a little more paint.

39:58.355 --> 40:00.065
Kinda like me.

40:09.699 --> 40:13.161
Someone leaked word to the press
about our alien friends.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.496
It's like humanity
deserves to know

40:14.579 --> 40:16.081
that we're not alone
in the universe.

40:16.164 --> 40:18.041
Well, the Aztecs
were doing just fine

40:18.125 --> 40:20.043
until Cortés showed up.

40:20.794 --> 40:23.922
Well, are we the Aztecs
or Cortés?

40:24.631 --> 40:26.383
We're about to find out.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.931
Yeah,
we're not supposed to be here.

41:15.015 --> 41:16.266
:
Well, this isn't ideal

41:16.349 --> 41:19.352
but I think we're
in the right solar system.

41:19.477 --> 41:20.770
So where's the planet?

41:20.854 --> 41:22.647
: We should be seeing her
any second.

41:30.363 --> 41:31.740
:
It's a slaughter.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.868
Plotting a course
to the planet.

41:34.951 --> 41:36.578
Overriding the controls
on the suits.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.496
Sir, respectfully, uh--

41:38.622 --> 41:39.581
All or nothing.

41:58.308 --> 41:59.976
AI, change course.

42:31.258 --> 42:33.134
:
Activating landing protocol.

42:53.405 --> 42:55.240
Oh, Jesus Christ, we made it.

42:55.949 --> 42:56.950
Oh, fuck!

42:57.033 --> 42:57.951
Holy shit.

42:58.743 --> 43:00.412
:
Oh, thank God.

43:02.330 --> 43:03.415
Wait, Ryle!

43:04.582 --> 43:06.543
What about Ford?
And Goss!

43:07.752 --> 43:08.795
Where's Dash?

43:08.878 --> 43:09.838
:
Ryle offline.

43:09.921 --> 43:11.881
Oh, fuck, it wasn't supposed
to go like this!

43:11.965 --> 43:12.966
:
Goss offline.

43:13.049 --> 43:14.718
: I can't seem to
lock on to their suit.

43:15.010 --> 43:16.886
They may very well be alive

43:17.762 --> 43:19.180
but highly unlikely.

43:20.682 --> 43:22.100
You still have the Q-bomb?

43:23.560 --> 43:25.812
No.
Uh, where'd it go?

43:27.314 --> 43:28.398
OK, OK.

43:28.606 --> 43:31.026
Hey, let's settle you down,
buddy, huh?

43:34.321 --> 43:36.990
The alien ship
is two clicks north.

43:38.366 --> 43:41.411
Let's get the coordinates
of their homeworld

43:41.494 --> 43:42.662
and merc some aliens.

43:42.746 --> 43:43.872
Yes, sir.
-

43:44.831 --> 43:46.166
:
Oh, shit!

43:46.583 --> 43:48.001
- Shit!

43:48.084 --> 43:49.461
Take cover!

43:51.463 --> 43:53.298
Can anyone get eyes
on the ship?

43:53.465 --> 43:54.549
:
Negative.

43:54.716 --> 43:57.135
Forget me.
Leave me and bomb them!

43:57.344 --> 43:58.636
I'm not leaving you behind!

43:59.637 --> 44:01.806
Finish the mission. Order!

44:07.103 --> 44:08.104
Shit.

44:12.984 --> 44:14.319
Here. Do it!

44:37.300 --> 44:38.426
What the...

44:38.510 --> 44:39.552
Hey!

44:40.720 --> 44:42.472
Hey, identify yourself!

44:44.682 --> 44:46.476
: Hey, hey, hey, hey,
weapons down!

44:46.559 --> 44:48.186
Speak up now!
- : What's goin' on?

44:48.269 --> 44:49.604
What the fuck is happening?

44:49.729 --> 44:51.272
The humans they hide in,
they can't speak.

44:51.356 --> 44:52.232
Say something.

44:52.315 --> 44:54.484
Get that fucking gun
out of my face!

44:54.609 --> 44:56.611
Like the man said!

44:57.028 --> 44:59.406
We're friendlies, yeah?

45:11.209 --> 45:13.294
Captain Nolan.
Sol Cantos.

45:13.711 --> 45:15.255
Man, you look like shit.

45:16.756 --> 45:17.924
Thank you.

45:18.007 --> 45:18.925
You a medic?

45:19.008 --> 45:21.302
I mean, I usually operate
on machines.

45:21.386 --> 45:23.721
So you're a wrench.
Could've just said something.

45:23.805 --> 45:25.223
Hey, hey, we've got a man down!

45:25.306 --> 45:27.350
Any of you a doctor or nurse?

45:28.726 --> 45:30.353
So you think he's gonna make it
or not?

45:30.478 --> 45:32.313
: I mean,
I need to get his armour off

45:32.397 --> 45:33.731
I can't see his wound.

45:35.859 --> 45:38.486
So, how's y'all's morning been?

45:42.198 --> 45:43.783
That a serious
fucking question?

45:44.617 --> 45:47.162
Dude... just tryin'
to make some conversation.

45:50.081 --> 45:52.083
: Are you guys supposed
to be the cavalry?

45:53.042 --> 45:54.836
Where the fuck is the Iron Army?

45:55.837 --> 45:57.922
We're sort of here
on our own volition.

45:58.006 --> 46:01.050
We lost, uh, half of our squad
on re-entry.

46:03.553 --> 46:06.181
We had 300-strong battalion
this mornin'.

46:06.264 --> 46:08.224
Aliens came
and fucked us up.

46:10.894 --> 46:12.312
We're lookin' for a down ship.

46:14.147 --> 46:15.607
Right around there.

46:17.317 --> 46:19.611
I wouldn't, the forest
is full of enemy patrol.

46:19.736 --> 46:23.198
But if you have to,
cut that way, go around back

46:23.281 --> 46:26.409
I'll watch the civilians,
you have his back.

46:29.037 --> 46:31.080
Uh, he's losing a lot of blood.

46:31.414 --> 46:33.750
We're takin' them over
to the orbital cannon

46:33.833 --> 46:34.959
just east of here.

46:35.043 --> 46:37.462
There's a med bay,
we could take him

46:37.712 --> 46:39.088
get him fixed up.

46:40.673 --> 46:44.511
Hey. You even think about dyin',
I'll fuckin' kill you.

46:45.053 --> 46:46.888
God knows
I'm too handsome to die.

46:49.265 --> 46:50.600
Right.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.268
:
Keep the Q-bomb warm.

46:52.519 --> 46:53.895
I'll get the coordinates.

46:55.021 --> 46:57.398
Eyes up, stay safe,
you're with me.

46:57.482 --> 46:58.775
Let's move.

46:58.858 --> 47:00.151
More like you're with me.

47:01.152 --> 47:03.488
Fight on, young man.
Fight on...

47:03.571 --> 47:05.198
:
OK, let's get you up, yeah?

48:13.683 --> 48:15.059
Can't be too safe.

49:00.897 --> 49:02.023
She was right.

49:03.149 --> 49:06.486
Whatever powers their ships
leaves a radioactive signature.

49:07.737 --> 49:09.489
:
How long is it gonna take?

49:10.365 --> 49:12.283
Forty seconds, easy.

49:15.203 --> 49:16.412
Oh, shit.

49:18.998 --> 49:20.416
The bastard made it.

49:20.750 --> 49:21.793
:
What bastard?

49:23.628 --> 49:25.755
The bastard, James Ford.

49:26.673 --> 49:28.132
The Blood General?

49:28.216 --> 49:29.509
One and the same.

49:30.718 --> 49:33.137
God, I'd love to buy that man
more than a beer.

49:34.555 --> 49:36.933
I can't believe the Alliance
benched him after Safdie.

49:37.016 --> 49:38.976
I mean, it was either us
or them.

49:39.936 --> 49:41.270
Can you believe that
they said

49:41.354 --> 49:43.439
he was too violent for war?

49:43.815 --> 49:46.067
I mean, do they not understand
that it takes a monster

49:46.150 --> 49:47.276
to kill a monster?

49:47.610 --> 49:50.238
I'm not even gonna get started
on how they cut our armed forces

49:50.321 --> 49:52.615
down to a third.
I mean, shit.

49:52.699 --> 49:54.242
Completely took out my unit.

49:54.325 --> 49:55.451
It's unbelievable.

49:55.785 --> 49:57.328
:
Coordinates recovered.

49:57.495 --> 49:58.871
Coordinates recovered.

49:59.622 --> 50:01.874
Relay coordinates
to Corporal Ardene.

50:01.958 --> 50:03.459
:
Unable to complete request.

50:03.543 --> 50:04.752
Tachyon interference.

50:04.836 --> 50:07.422
Fuck.
This fuckin' piece of shit.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.099
: We could head
to the orbital cannon

50:18.182 --> 50:19.225
three clicks southwest.

50:19.308 --> 50:21.686
There's a comms bay,
we could get some signal out.

50:24.063 --> 50:25.273
What about Ford?

50:26.357 --> 50:27.817
You really think he's alive?

50:56.220 --> 50:57.513
:
Concussion detected.

50:57.597 --> 50:59.265
Please seek medical attention.

50:59.515 --> 51:00.850
Concussion detected.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.518
Please seek medical attention.

51:11.944 --> 51:13.362
:
Unable to translate.

51:13.446 --> 51:14.947
Unable to translate.

52:51.627 --> 52:52.628
:
Ford.

53:06.976 --> 53:08.561
We've got the coordinates
to their homeworld.

53:08.644 --> 53:10.730
Let's get to the base
and find the quant port.

53:10.813 --> 53:11.981
Just keep movin'.

53:13.608 --> 53:14.692
Just keep movin'.

54:08.955 --> 54:10.456
: This is Dr Y--
-

54:10.539 --> 54:12.667
The invaders, they have a way
to transfer their...

54:12.750 --> 54:13.751
their assets.

54:13.834 --> 54:15.086
They are parasites.

54:15.169 --> 54:17.296
They use their blood
to procreate.

54:17.380 --> 54:19.298
They hijack
not only the host's body

54:19.382 --> 54:20.758
but their minds.

54:20.883 --> 54:22.551
They are one army.

54:23.094 --> 54:25.096
One mind.
-

54:31.310 --> 54:32.687
:
Security door malfunction.

54:32.812 --> 54:34.480
Please seek emergency shelter.

54:52.581 --> 54:54.917
Hey, here's the coordinates.

54:55.543 --> 54:57.128
: There's too much
tachyon interference

54:57.253 --> 54:59.422
the quant ports are useless.

54:59.505 --> 55:02.550
We would have to go into orbit
to fire the Q-bomb.

55:03.884 --> 55:04.844
Fuck!

55:13.811 --> 55:15.229
How you doin', youngster?

55:16.897 --> 55:18.858
No lying down on the job,
killer.

55:26.032 --> 55:27.700
How you holdin' up, soldier?

55:30.369 --> 55:31.746
Peachy.

55:36.083 --> 55:37.668
I'm fuckin' terrified.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.015
:
You're alright.

55:51.098 --> 55:52.808
You're gonna miss my voice.

56:03.069 --> 56:04.361
What are you doing?

56:16.791 --> 56:18.751
He was gonna die anyway.

56:21.337 --> 56:22.421
He was...

56:24.256 --> 56:25.341
He was just...

57:25.776 --> 57:27.194
Who died?

57:28.863 --> 57:30.072
Ahem.

57:35.536 --> 57:36.787
Not now.

57:43.294 --> 57:44.962
How are you still alive?

57:46.630 --> 57:47.715
Lucky.

57:55.181 --> 57:57.933
Here I was thinkin' that we were
way more advanced than them.

57:59.018 --> 58:02.646
They built this 90,000 miles
above our heads.

58:03.606 --> 58:06.901
That there is a stabilised
quantum space gate.

58:07.109 --> 58:08.360
That's impossible.

58:08.694 --> 58:10.613
You can't make a space gate
that big.

58:10.696 --> 58:13.073
They can connect any two points
in the universe.

58:13.199 --> 58:14.783
They can bring their army here?

58:14.992 --> 58:15.993
:
Yeah.

58:17.119 --> 58:19.038
What's the status of the Q-bomb?

58:19.830 --> 58:22.333
It's stable for now.

58:24.168 --> 58:26.795
If we wanna launch the Q-bomb,
we need to get into orbit.

58:32.009 --> 58:33.844
So I gotta be the one
that says it?

58:38.849 --> 58:40.559
Maybe we blow us
and them all to hell

58:40.684 --> 58:41.685
when their fleet arrives.

58:41.769 --> 58:44.855
I mean, well, technically,
we'd all be sucked to hell

58:44.939 --> 58:46.899
in the black hole
the Q-bomb creates.

58:47.775 --> 58:49.568
Being sucked off by the universe
doesn't sound

58:49.652 --> 58:51.028
like the worst way to go.

58:52.154 --> 58:54.281
You think they have something
more powerful than us?

58:57.243 --> 58:58.827
They don't wanna destroy us.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.667
They don't want us dead.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.087
:
Colonisation?

59:09.004 --> 59:11.048
That's what we would do
if we had the upper hand.

59:13.550 --> 59:14.635
You know...

59:16.512 --> 59:19.556
we could just...
send it to them.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.309
We can't just surrender.

59:22.810 --> 59:24.228
Nobody's surrendering.

59:28.399 --> 59:31.819
I mean, we are in the middle
of an orbital cannon.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.404
Why can't we just
load the Q-bomb

59:33.487 --> 59:35.489
and shoot it
through the space gate?

59:35.948 --> 59:38.367
If... if I can get it
back online

59:38.450 --> 59:42.121
then... then we could,
maybe.

59:42.204 --> 59:43.747
But that still
doesn't answer the question

59:43.831 --> 59:45.541
of how we're gonna
close the space gate.

59:47.710 --> 59:49.211
Maybe we can't.

59:52.798 --> 59:54.758
If we can't, we'll be sucked

59:54.842 --> 59:56.635
into the black hole
the Q-bomb creates.

59:58.637 --> 1:00:00.306
But we'll save everybody else.

1:00:02.141 --> 1:00:03.350
Part of the job.

1:00:04.852 --> 1:00:06.520
:
Quantum bridge detected.

1:00:06.603 --> 1:00:09.523
Quantum bridge stability
at 87%.

1:00:35.924 --> 1:00:37.593
Hey, can I get a word, boss?

1:00:38.719 --> 1:00:39.762
Alone.

1:00:48.395 --> 1:00:49.980
Look, I've been thinkin'.

1:00:50.814 --> 1:00:51.815
Did it hurt?

1:00:52.232 --> 1:00:55.652
This is... Nah, this is crazy.

1:00:56.904 --> 1:00:58.697
:
We don't need this shit.

1:00:59.281 --> 1:01:00.449
Come on, you and me.

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:01.742
What do you say?

1:01:01.825 --> 1:01:04.036
There's no hard feelings
if you wanna split.

1:01:04.787 --> 1:01:06.038
Like, really?

1:01:06.955 --> 1:01:08.290
Yeah, really.

1:01:10.125 --> 1:01:11.377
Oh...

1:01:12.002 --> 1:01:13.170
fuck it.

1:01:13.253 --> 1:01:15.756
I always thought I'd die
standing with a gun in my hand.

1:01:17.383 --> 1:01:18.425
Let's do it.

1:01:27.976 --> 1:01:29.144
Oh...

1:01:29.228 --> 1:01:31.438
Hey. Are these yours?

1:01:32.898 --> 1:01:34.316
Did you lose these?

1:01:35.192 --> 1:01:36.318
Yeah.
- Yeah?

1:01:36.402 --> 1:01:37.319
Mm-hm.

1:01:37.403 --> 1:01:39.863
Are you... how did you get here?
Are you here by yourself?

1:01:39.947 --> 1:01:42.324
Is your mum here?
Is your dad here?

1:01:43.242 --> 1:01:44.284
OK.

1:01:44.368 --> 1:01:46.412
OK,
everything's gonna be OK now.

1:01:47.079 --> 1:01:48.831
Yeah,
everything's gonna be OK.

1:01:50.290 --> 1:01:51.708
The good guys are here now.

1:01:53.293 --> 1:01:55.963
We're gonna be...
we're gonna be OK.

1:01:57.798 --> 1:01:59.174
Oh, wow!

1:01:59.925 --> 1:02:01.552
That looks so cool.

1:02:03.137 --> 1:02:04.555
Can I borrow those?

1:02:04.638 --> 1:02:06.557
When I go into space,
can I wear them?

1:02:07.933 --> 1:02:08.851
I can't?

1:02:08.934 --> 1:02:10.978
Oh, come on.

1:02:11.103 --> 1:02:12.354
- Hey, shh.

1:02:14.314 --> 1:02:15.732
We're gonna be OK.

1:02:16.525 --> 1:02:17.818
Everything's gonna be OK.

1:02:19.361 --> 1:02:20.821
Yeah, I promise.

1:02:40.257 --> 1:02:41.341
:
Bomb detected.

1:02:41.633 --> 1:02:43.969
Please take care when activating
the orbital cannon.

1:03:10.162 --> 1:03:11.663
:
I've fought these things.

1:03:12.206 --> 1:03:14.124
If we leave that door open,
they're gonna charge in

1:03:14.208 --> 1:03:15.709
and we can make this
the kill box.

1:03:18.837 --> 1:03:19.880
Good.

1:03:31.433 --> 1:03:34.394
Hard to imagine
that something so small

1:03:35.020 --> 1:03:36.939
caused so much damage.

1:03:40.067 --> 1:03:41.902
What we do here is easy.

1:03:43.612 --> 1:03:46.114
The hard part
is you're living with it.

1:03:48.617 --> 1:03:50.702
You got somebody waiting for you
back home?

1:03:56.542 --> 1:03:59.628
Don't end up an old soldier

1:04:01.547 --> 1:04:04.550
living a life of regret.

1:04:07.636 --> 1:04:10.472
You never know when the universe
is gonna take 'em away.

1:04:11.557 --> 1:04:12.975
When you find someone

1:04:15.477 --> 1:04:17.187
don't tell 'em what we do here.

1:04:19.022 --> 1:04:21.400
They'll never look at you
the same way again.

1:04:53.765 --> 1:04:55.726
:
Orbital cannon is online.

1:04:55.809 --> 1:04:57.978
Eight giga-charge,
seven minutes.

1:04:58.395 --> 1:05:02.816
Commencing long-range
comms check, 3, 2, 1.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:03.984
:
This is Ryle.

1:05:04.651 --> 1:05:05.986
Can anyone hear me?

1:05:06.278 --> 1:05:07.821
Yeah, yeah, we read you.

1:05:08.697 --> 1:05:10.240
We thought you were dead.

1:05:10.824 --> 1:05:12.159
:
Should've known better.

1:05:13.952 --> 1:05:15.329
Is Braxton alive?

1:05:16.580 --> 1:05:20.375
Yeah, I mean, we lost, um,
Marcus and Goss.

1:05:22.628 --> 1:05:25.547
: If we don't hold
'em here, Earth will be next.

1:05:26.673 --> 1:05:28.008
My suit is damaged.

1:05:28.258 --> 1:05:30.344
I still have control
of the aft-thrusters.

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:32.262
I need the options.

1:05:33.764 --> 1:05:35.432
A plasma shot
from the orbital cannon

1:05:35.515 --> 1:05:38.518
isn't strong enough
to destroy something that size.

1:05:39.102 --> 1:05:40.270
:
I know.

1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:43.690
I want to get close
and trigger the self-destruct.

1:05:49.780 --> 1:05:51.323
Don't tell Braxton.

1:05:51.907 --> 1:05:53.492
He already thinks I'm dead.

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:56.495
I don't wanna hurt him more.

1:06:16.223 --> 1:06:17.432
So what do you say?

1:06:17.516 --> 1:06:18.809
Think we have a chance?

1:06:18.892 --> 1:06:20.477
This war has been
playin' out in nature

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:23.188
for 13.8 billion years.

1:06:23.271 --> 1:06:24.981
When two intelligent
species collide

1:06:25.065 --> 1:06:26.817
one is always gonna
dominate the other.

1:06:26.900 --> 1:06:28.402
No, I meant you and me.

1:06:32.030 --> 1:06:33.490
It could be different this time.

1:06:33.865 --> 1:06:35.534
How many Neanderthals
do you know?

1:06:35.701 --> 1:06:37.285
Present company excepted?

1:06:41.581 --> 1:06:43.583
We should expect
some sort of air assault.

1:06:44.084 --> 1:06:46.044
Are you sure
you can handle that thing?

1:06:46.128 --> 1:06:47.587
I've handled bigger.

1:06:53.468 --> 1:06:54.553
You're an idiot.

1:07:52.402 --> 1:07:53.445
:
Take cover!

1:08:56.132 --> 1:08:59.261
:
I... like this body.

1:08:59.845 --> 1:09:00.887
It...

1:09:02.597 --> 1:09:04.266
agrees with me.

1:09:06.059 --> 1:09:08.603
Could you strike me down

1:09:09.104 --> 1:09:11.940
now that I wear her face?

1:09:51.646 --> 1:09:52.731
Scorpions...

1:09:53.189 --> 1:09:54.524
dancing in...

1:09:55.650 --> 1:09:56.818
my brain.

1:09:57.986 --> 1:10:01.281
They use us... as...

1:10:01.907 --> 1:10:04.659
vessels, parasites.

1:10:11.833 --> 1:10:16.588
No one deserves war,
but what would our kind do?

1:10:17.881 --> 1:10:21.593
They only want warriors
when there's war

1:10:22.344 --> 1:10:25.055
and then they call you
"barbarians"

1:10:25.305 --> 1:10:28.183
when you have sacrificed
to protect them.

1:10:29.392 --> 1:10:32.687
Our culture is war.

1:10:33.563 --> 1:10:37.025
Our breeding, our prayers.

1:10:38.443 --> 1:10:42.322
The Sigea
are the true apex race.

1:10:43.490 --> 1:10:46.368
We have ways to make our...

1:10:47.369 --> 1:10:50.163
great legends immortal.

1:10:51.915 --> 1:10:54.292
I offer you this one chance.

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:59.381
Embrace us
or we will become you.

1:11:04.177 --> 1:11:05.345
Nope!

1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:15.355
We cannot coexist,
like you and your friend

1:11:16.272 --> 1:11:18.733
the warrior and the scientist.

1:11:19.859 --> 1:11:23.446
When you told her of
your experience in the field

1:11:23.989 --> 1:11:28.743
she could only see you
as a monster

1:11:30.245 --> 1:11:31.538
a butcher.

1:11:33.832 --> 1:11:39.838
You will witness the erasure
of your species.

1:11:41.256 --> 1:11:42.549
:
Hey, boss?

1:11:43.008 --> 1:11:45.051
You think instead of, uh,
stopping a war

1:11:45.135 --> 1:11:47.887
we actually might have
started one?

1:12:58.917 --> 1:13:01.211
:
Orbital cannon, 50% power.

1:13:01.628 --> 1:13:03.129
Incoming hostile fire.

1:13:03.213 --> 1:13:04.923
Hey guys, be ready,
incoming artillery.

1:13:37.747 --> 1:13:40.333
- Go, go, go!

1:14:53.198 --> 1:14:55.950
:
Long-range stability, 98%.

1:14:57.035 --> 1:14:58.203
Collision imminent.

1:14:58.328 --> 1:14:59.370
Collision imminent.

1:14:59.454 --> 1:15:00.496
No shit.

1:15:05.210 --> 1:15:07.462
:
Orbital cannon at 100% power.

1:15:07.545 --> 1:15:09.672
Orbital cannon 100% power.

1:15:10.256 --> 1:15:12.634
Ready for outer atmosphere
asset delivery.

1:15:21.434 --> 1:15:23.895
Q-bomb loaded into
missile delivery system.

1:15:23.978 --> 1:15:25.521
Please confirm launch.

1:15:27.148 --> 1:15:28.316
Q-bomb detected.

1:15:28.399 --> 1:15:29.984
Confirm launch coordinates.

1:15:32.028 --> 1:15:33.529
Error, not authorised.

1:15:36.407 --> 1:15:37.825
Initiate override.

1:15:38.117 --> 1:15:39.494
:
Error, not authorised.

1:16:25.999 --> 1:16:27.166
:
Override.

1:16:43.057 --> 1:16:44.225
This is fine.

1:16:44.517 --> 1:16:45.768
This is fine.

1:18:19.362 --> 1:18:21.447
We never wanted peace.

1:18:55.356 --> 1:18:57.191
:
Event horizon established.

1:18:57.525 --> 1:19:00.027
Enemy fleets will transit over
momentarily.

1:19:05.908 --> 1:19:07.994
The AI won't ignite the fuel.

1:19:09.745 --> 1:19:12.039
I'm sending you the co-ordinates
for my suit.

1:19:12.248 --> 1:19:13.332
What do you mean?

1:19:15.001 --> 1:19:16.711
What do you mean?
What do you mean?

1:19:16.794 --> 1:19:18.045
:
Listen to me.

1:19:18.129 --> 1:19:20.381
I know there's enough fuel
in my suit

1:19:20.465 --> 1:19:21.924
to take this thing out.

1:19:24.594 --> 1:19:25.845
I just need a kick.

1:19:43.321 --> 1:19:44.489
Hey, kid.

1:19:46.199 --> 1:19:47.783
I gotta sign out now.

1:19:51.871 --> 1:19:53.831
Don't make it harder
than it has to be.

1:19:54.749 --> 1:19:56.417
No, no.

1:19:58.961 --> 1:20:00.671
There has to be another way.

1:20:03.341 --> 1:20:05.885
If there was, trust me.

1:20:53.432 --> 1:20:54.433
Alright.

1:22:20.645 --> 1:22:21.812
Hey!

1:23:51.068 --> 1:23:52.737
: Standby
for a mandatory address

1:23:52.820 --> 1:23:54.697
from the Alliance Senate leader.

1:23:56.782 --> 1:23:58.451
: Standby
for a mandatory address

1:23:58.534 --> 1:24:00.411
from the Alliance Senate leader.

1:24:11.088 --> 1:24:13.257
:
We are victorious.

1:24:13.466 --> 1:24:14.675
Delegates on behalf

1:24:14.759 --> 1:24:18.304
of the remaining members
of the alien civilisation

1:24:18.554 --> 1:24:23.517
have today agreed to a total
and unconditional surrender.

1:24:25.352 --> 1:24:28.355
This is thanks
to the heroic sacrifices

1:24:28.439 --> 1:24:30.357
of Alliance soldiers

1:24:30.441 --> 1:24:33.444
who acted on
prescient top-secret orders

1:24:33.527 --> 1:24:35.362
from the Alliance Senate.

1:24:36.197 --> 1:24:38.365
Ellora will rebuild

1:24:38.699 --> 1:24:41.160
and with Earth's assistance

1:24:41.243 --> 1:24:44.872
our armies will grow
stronger than ever

1:24:44.997 --> 1:24:49.960
prepared to defend our liberty
at home and abroad.

1:24:50.711 --> 1:24:53.631
The Alliance
remains unconquered.

1:24:54.048 --> 1:24:56.008
United...
-

1:25:01.138 --> 1:25:03.599
: I wanna watch
the stars with someone.

1:25:04.391 --> 1:25:07.061
Well, if there's still a bar
standing at the end of all this

1:25:07.728 --> 1:25:09.230
I guess you could
buy me a drink.

1:25:10.439 --> 1:25:12.566
:
May our kingdom endure

1:25:12.650 --> 1:25:14.527
for a thousand years.

1:25:14.819 --> 1:25:19.073
May the god of war
be on our side always

1:25:20.282 --> 1:25:24.453
and may we continue our search
for peace in the cosmos.

1:25:45.850 --> 1:25:50.604
with a knife in a hand

1:26:09.290 --> 1:26:14.962
with a knife in a hand

1:26:15.421 --> 1:26:20.175
of battles past

1:26:21.010 --> 1:26:26.307
catching me and that's bad

1:27:19.526 --> 1:27:24.698
can't find it hard
