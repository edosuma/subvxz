WEBVTT

00:01.262 --> 00:02.785
- Previously on "The Flash"...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.439
- We've been looking at that
front page for four years.

00:04.482 --> 00:06.832
I'm the one that
writes that article, Barry.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.921
- My boss' husband
is the Flash?

00:08.965 --> 00:09.966
- Mm-hmm.

00:10.010 --> 00:11.141
- Oh, God,
nobody tells me anything.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.838
- This substance
appears to heal

00:12.882 --> 00:14.666
any and all weaknesses
in the human body.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.233
I've learned to control it.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.061
This is my final masterpiece:

00:18.105 --> 00:19.062
life eternal.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.716
- I've seen your version
of life.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.152
It's a nightmare.

00:22.196 --> 00:25.982
- I want to show you this.
- I recognize that pin.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.288
- I have a follow-up question.

00:53.531 --> 00:56.578
- Whoo!
That was quite the tumble.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.971
I guess you're wondering
why I'm doing this to you.

00:59.015 --> 01:01.104
- You're evil.
I get it.

01:30.002 --> 01:32.309
- I bet it's been a while since
you felt your own mortality,

01:32.353 --> 01:36.270
but my powers, like yours,
work on a cellular level.

01:36.313 --> 01:38.446
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:49.196 --> 01:51.981
You know, Iron Heights...

01:52.024 --> 01:54.331
is gonna send me
a thank-you basket

01:54.375 --> 01:56.812
when I drop you off as a gift.

01:58.422 --> 02:01.643
- I've already
given you a gift,

02:01.686 --> 02:05.734
and now I'm gonna need it back.

02:18.268 --> 02:21.228
- My destiny is
to heal all of mankind.

02:21.271 --> 02:25.275
You and your friends can't be
allowed to prevent that.

02:25.319 --> 02:29.497
Life demands your death.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.375
- Ralph!

02:38.419 --> 02:40.203
Ralph...
Ralph.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.423
Ralph, come on.

02:44.860 --> 02:46.209
- Give us a hand.
- What happened?

02:46.253 --> 02:48.385
- Ramsey.

02:48.429 --> 02:49.778
- Come on, Coach, we--
we still gotta go

02:49.821 --> 02:51.606
on that road trip, right?

02:51.649 --> 02:53.347
He's gonna die.

02:53.390 --> 02:55.218
- Frost, how do we save him?
- I don't know!

02:55.262 --> 02:57.264
I can't fix this.

02:57.307 --> 03:00.180
Uh, maybe Caitlin can.

03:05.533 --> 03:08.100
- Ralph's elastic cells aren't
mending like they used to.

03:08.144 --> 03:09.841
Ramsey must be
getting stronger.

03:09.885 --> 03:11.930
- So Ralph can't heal himself?
- No.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.323
But maybe you can.
- What?

03:13.367 --> 03:15.020
- Your speed healing is
the only thing we've seen

03:15.064 --> 03:16.587
that can repair damage
this severe.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.110
Maybe if we gave him

03:18.154 --> 03:19.242
a blood transfusion,
that would fix him.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.635
- What are you saying?

03:20.678 --> 03:21.853
I--I--I could give Ralph
my speed healing?

03:21.897 --> 03:22.941
- Theoretically,
temporarily, yes.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.508
I don't know, we're sort of

03:24.552 --> 03:25.901
in uncharted
medical territory here.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.337
But your blood type
is O-negative,

03:27.381 --> 03:29.600
so you're a universal donor.

03:29.644 --> 03:31.254
- Guys, Ralph is elastic.

03:31.298 --> 03:34.562
No needle can puncture
through his skin.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.303
- I can phase him.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.218
- Will that work?

03:40.002 --> 03:42.265
Do it.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.353
- Got it?
- Yeah.

03:43.397 --> 03:45.225
- Ready?
- Yeah.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.067
- Hey.
How is he?

04:02.111 --> 04:05.375
- He's stable
thanks to you.

04:05.419 --> 04:07.290
We contacted A.R.G.U.S.,
and they're gonna move Ralph

04:07.334 --> 04:11.120
to a secure medical facility
for recovery.

04:11.163 --> 04:14.384
Cisco and Caitlin are prepping
for transport right now.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.432
Hey, don't worry, okay?
He's gonna pull through.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.960
- It's not that.

04:25.003 --> 04:27.441
What if I hadn't been here?

04:27.484 --> 04:30.661
Ralph's fight was nothing
compared to what's coming.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.924
Crisis is only two days away.

04:32.968 --> 04:36.232
- And we're all ready,
I promise.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.974
- Iris, if I haven't
prepared the team--

04:39.017 --> 04:40.889
- You have prepared us, Barry.

04:44.458 --> 04:49.071
Hey, don't let what happened
to Ralph fill you with doubt.

04:49.114 --> 04:52.596
You've done the work.
We're ready...

04:52.640 --> 04:54.642
For whatever comes next...

05:22.626 --> 05:26.151
I'm gonna give you one chance
to turn yourself in.

05:26.195 --> 05:29.590
Honestly, I hope you
don't take it.

05:29.633 --> 05:32.114
- Well, there's no need
to involve the authorities.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.464
I just want to talk...

05:37.728 --> 05:39.948
Flash.

05:46.563 --> 05:50.437
- Of course.
You're the Flash.

05:50.480 --> 05:54.658
But how did--
when?

05:54.702 --> 05:57.182
You were struck
by lightning.

05:57.226 --> 06:00.577
That is quite the origin story.

06:11.719 --> 06:14.635
I don't know how
you're doing this.

06:14.678 --> 06:17.333
Real or not,
I'm coming for you.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.902
- And yet I'm not
your foremost concern, am I?

06:20.945 --> 06:25.210
Not as much as your inevitable
demise in a coming...

06:25.254 --> 06:26.647
Crisis?

06:26.690 --> 06:28.431
Goodness, you really are
full of surprises, aren't you?

06:28.475 --> 06:32.783
So tell me, when you saw
all those permutations,

06:32.827 --> 06:37.527
billions of possible futures
all ending in your death...

06:39.224 --> 06:42.706
What role did I play?

06:42.750 --> 06:44.882
- You didn't.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.797
You weren't there.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.539
- Really?
Not even in one?

06:49.583 --> 06:51.759
Huh. Then again,

06:51.802 --> 06:53.761
you never saw
this coming did you?

06:53.804 --> 06:55.980
Frankly,
neither did I.

06:56.024 --> 07:00.202
Makes one believe
in the impossible, doesn't it?

07:01.159 --> 07:04.380
You look scared.
You should be.

07:04.424 --> 07:09.603
After all, it is the
end of the world, isn't it?

07:38.545 --> 07:42.766
Oh, my--oh.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.115
- What's that,
Flash?

07:44.159 --> 07:46.161
You think I should
bust my boss

07:46.204 --> 07:48.729
for keeping yet
another secret from me?

07:48.772 --> 07:51.427
Yeah, me too.

08:02.307 --> 08:06.529
- Drop what you're doing.
"The Citizen" has a new story.

08:06.573 --> 08:10.881
Look at these.

08:10.925 --> 08:12.274
- Where did you get
these photos?

08:12.317 --> 08:14.145
- I pulled them from
a bow tie camera.

08:14.189 --> 08:15.669
- Long story.
Look, the point is,

08:15.712 --> 08:18.585
this is the same guy that
kidnapped your cousin Esperanza

08:18.628 --> 08:21.109
and turned her into a
meta-assassin against her will.

08:21.152 --> 08:23.198
One of these photos,
this one,

08:23.241 --> 08:25.243
shows our mystery man
getting out of his car.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.158
My dad traced his plates
and tracked the car

08:27.202 --> 08:29.204
to a rented parking space
at a nearby lot.

08:29.247 --> 08:33.469
So now all we have to do
is to wait for him to show up.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.559
- Cool.
Just checking,

08:36.603 --> 08:39.649
are there any other stories
you wanna work on first?

08:39.693 --> 08:40.563
What could need

08:40.607 --> 08:42.739
our attention more than this?

08:42.783 --> 08:44.219
Your cousin was a victim,
Allegra,

08:44.262 --> 08:46.351
and now some secret
organization is using her.

08:46.395 --> 08:47.788
I mean, how many others
are they using?

08:47.831 --> 08:48.919
- We need to help them.

08:48.963 --> 08:52.923
- Right, I mean,
no one wants to find out

08:52.967 --> 08:55.622
what happened to Esperanza
more than me, but...

08:55.665 --> 08:59.756
is this really what matters
the most to you right now?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.280
- Yeah. Now come on,
get your stuff.

09:02.324 --> 09:05.022
Kamilla is going to see if she
can recover any other photos.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.809
You and I have a stakeout date.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.550
- You're the boss.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.595
- Brain activity looks good.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.075
No sign that
you're going nuts.

09:14.118 --> 09:15.293
- And my blood work?

09:15.337 --> 09:16.686
- CBC,
metabolic rate,

09:16.730 --> 09:18.993
all normal for a speedster,

09:19.036 --> 09:21.778
just a small spike in cortisol.

09:21.822 --> 09:23.606
Katie says that
sleep monitor on your wrist

09:23.650 --> 09:25.565
will tell us if there's
anything seriously wrong,

09:25.608 --> 09:28.785
but if you ask me,
you just had a nightmare.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.658
- I don't know.

09:31.701 --> 09:35.009
Ramsey seemed so real.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.358
Something feels off.

09:36.401 --> 09:39.579
I just can't
put my finger on it.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.541
- Hi, there.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.587
My name is Iris West-Allen.
I'm with "The Citizen."

09:47.630 --> 09:50.981
I was wondering if I could
ask you a few questions.

09:51.025 --> 09:53.636
- Sorry, not interested.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.030
- Hi.
Same paper, same question.

09:56.073 --> 09:57.640
- What the hell's
going on here?

09:57.684 --> 09:59.294
I don't have time for this.
I'm late for work.

09:59.337 --> 10:01.122
- Which is where, exactly?

10:01.165 --> 10:03.515
- None of your business.

10:03.559 --> 10:05.474
- Okay, you know what?
You're right.

10:05.517 --> 10:08.956
We will just run our photos
without any comments.

10:10.914 --> 10:12.829
- What photos?

10:15.571 --> 10:16.920
- You know what?
I'm sure your employer

10:16.964 --> 10:20.837
will love
the free exposure.

10:20.881 --> 10:22.273
- All right,
have it your way.

10:22.317 --> 10:23.884
- Easy,
I've got a Taser.

10:23.927 --> 10:25.929
- And I have a business card.

10:28.932 --> 10:30.325
Maelstrom Couriers,

10:30.368 --> 10:32.066
the premiere name
in high-end transport.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.372
- Transporting what exactly?

10:34.416 --> 10:37.375
- Whatever the wealthy would
prefer to keep under the radar,

10:37.419 --> 10:38.899
specialty items mostly.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.684
That woman in a coma
was a government job.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.818
Meister's party, well, that was
more like designated driving

10:44.861 --> 10:47.342
for billionaires
falling off the wagon.

10:47.385 --> 10:50.519
Today it's priceless
family jewels.

10:50.562 --> 10:51.999
- You're an Uber
for the uberrich.

10:52.042 --> 10:54.958
- What I am is late.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.134
- Sorry to bother you.
Thank you.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.573
- That was a bust.
- Yep.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.358
- But the bright side is,
we have time for other stories

11:03.401 --> 11:05.839
we might be putting off.
Got any in mind?

11:05.882 --> 11:07.405
- You know,
I don't know,

11:07.449 --> 11:09.799
I think there's something
that we missed.

11:09.843 --> 11:12.193
I don't want to
move off of this yet.

11:59.153 --> 12:01.459
Mom?

12:02.939 --> 12:04.724
Is this another nightmare?

12:05.942 --> 12:10.425
- No, Barry.
This is much, much worse.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.132
- You're the Speed Force.

12:22.176 --> 12:24.961
- Yes.

12:25.005 --> 12:28.791
It's been a while since
we've talked like this.

12:28.835 --> 12:31.011
I've missed it.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.969
- You need to help.

12:33.013 --> 12:35.406
I don't understand
what's happening to me.

12:35.450 --> 12:38.801
- You used your blood
to save your friend's life,

12:38.845 --> 12:42.022
but in the process,
you've endangered your own.

12:44.067 --> 12:47.505
A small amount of Ramsey's
cells remain from the attack,

12:47.549 --> 12:49.246
hidden from the eye.

12:51.248 --> 12:52.815
- Ramsey's infected me.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.557
- And more than you realize.
Ramsey's sentience,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.734
his very being,
resides in his cells.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.693
- That's how he knew
I'm the Flash,

13:01.737 --> 13:03.870
about Crisis.

13:07.351 --> 13:11.225
If this--
if this is all in my mind,

13:11.268 --> 13:13.836
then where's
my real body?

13:13.880 --> 13:16.186
- After your friend,
Frost, examined you,

13:16.230 --> 13:19.494
you came back home, dropped
your keys in that bowl,

13:19.537 --> 13:21.888
poured a glass of water,

13:21.931 --> 13:23.846
then the infection took hold.

13:27.981 --> 13:30.418
As we speak,
Ramsey's infection is spreading

13:30.461 --> 13:33.073
through your body
and your mind.

13:33.116 --> 13:36.163
Your speed-healing is trying
to hold off his disease,

13:36.206 --> 13:38.382
but, ultimately,

13:38.426 --> 13:41.908
it's up to you to resist him.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.997
- Is he trying to kill me?

13:44.040 --> 13:46.782
- Worse, I'm afraid.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.958
He wants
to take control of you

13:49.002 --> 13:51.526
and bend you to his will.

13:51.569 --> 13:54.921
- Then he's gonna lose.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.532
- There must be
something that points

13:57.575 --> 13:58.794
to where Esperanza was taken.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.230
I don't know.
Hospital records?

14:00.274 --> 14:01.971
Or what about
that auction photo?

14:02.015 --> 14:04.452
That mystery man was a dead
end, but Barry did say

14:04.495 --> 14:06.454
that there were a lot
of shady people at that gala,

14:06.497 --> 14:09.109
so, I don't know, maybe one of
them might be a new lead.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.675
- Or...

14:10.719 --> 14:14.941
we could talk about how
your husband is the Flash.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.164
- How did you--

14:21.208 --> 14:23.819
- Nash Wells told me.
- You're not gonna--

14:23.863 --> 14:26.822
Is this the story that
you've been trying to tell?

14:26.866 --> 14:30.217
Allegra, Barry's identity
cannot be exposed.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.480
- No, not that.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.614
This.

14:37.050 --> 14:40.140
You've been avoiding
it all day.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.142
- It's not time for that yet.

14:42.838 --> 14:46.189
- Well, according to this,
it will be in two days,

14:46.233 --> 14:47.756
and call it a hunch,
but I don't think

14:47.799 --> 14:49.018
you're planning
to write it then either.

14:55.938 --> 14:58.810
I ever tell you
why I wanted

14:58.854 --> 15:00.900
to be a reporter
in the first place?

15:00.943 --> 15:04.729
It was because of your article
about the Streak.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.130
You know,
that was the first name

15:14.174 --> 15:16.263
that I ever gave
to the Flash.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.832
Back then, I didn't
even know that he was Barry.

15:20.876 --> 15:26.403
- And back then, I was just
a troubled kid in Iron Heights,

15:26.447 --> 15:28.623
but your article,

15:28.666 --> 15:32.105
it made me
believe in the impossible,

15:32.148 --> 15:34.934
that maybe someday
I could be like you,

15:34.977 --> 15:38.154
chasing stories,
uncovering the truth.

15:38.198 --> 15:41.984
You gave me hope
when I had none...

15:42.680 --> 15:45.292
Just like you have every day
I've worked here.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.122
I don't know how you're
gonna bring yourself

15:49.165 --> 15:52.516
to write this article.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.996
I just know

15:54.040 --> 15:57.086
you're never going to forgive
yourself if you don't.

16:09.272 --> 16:10.882
What's--how did I?

16:17.063 --> 16:18.194
- Allen.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.761
Looks like we're both
back on our feet.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.155
- Babe, I'm glad
you're feeling better.

16:22.198 --> 16:25.985
- Thanks.
- Look, I made you a plate.

16:27.943 --> 16:30.554
- Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm,
delicious.

16:30.598 --> 16:32.774
- I'm all about
these mashed potatoes.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.690
- I'm gonna need a
second helping of these beans.

16:35.733 --> 16:37.387
That's both praise,
and a warning.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.261
Uh-oh.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.051
This is wrong.

16:49.095 --> 16:51.053
- Everyone.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.620
I've got homemade lasagna.

17:12.248 --> 17:14.207
- Nom.

17:14.250 --> 17:16.339
- Barry.

17:17.297 --> 17:19.734
It's rude not to eat.

17:21.127 --> 17:24.130
- You're not Iris.
This isn't real.

17:26.001 --> 17:28.395
I'm not gonna give in to you.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.832
- Barry, you misjudge me.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.748
I'm just here to enjoy supper
with good friends

17:33.791 --> 17:37.578
and perhaps offer you a gift.

17:37.621 --> 17:39.623
- What could you
possibly offer me?

17:41.538 --> 17:44.237
all: Everything.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.393
Ah!

18:14.876 --> 18:19.010
- Barry, you can't run away
from your own mind,

18:19.054 --> 18:21.709
at least not without
considerable pain.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.102
Then again,
you're always trying

18:23.145 --> 18:25.016
to run away from
your problems, aren't you?

18:26.409 --> 18:27.541
- You've literally
had a newspaper

18:27.584 --> 18:29.195
warning of your demise.

18:29.238 --> 18:33.155
You've done nothing
to change your fate.

18:33.199 --> 18:37.333
It's almost like you want
to make Iris a widow.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.248
- Shut up!

18:52.218 --> 18:55.264
This isn't real.

19:02.271 --> 19:05.056
- These deaths were real.

19:16.764 --> 19:19.549
- None of them had to die.

19:19.593 --> 19:23.162
Join me,
and you'll never have to.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.936
- Nora.

20:01.374 --> 20:04.246
Hey.

20:11.340 --> 20:15.431
Please, let me hold her.
I know it's not real, I just--

20:15.475 --> 20:16.824
please, I just wanna
pretend for--

20:16.867 --> 20:18.826
please,
just for a second--

20:18.869 --> 20:21.437
I just--please,
I wanna hold my baby.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.613
- That's not my choice, Barry.

20:23.657 --> 20:26.442
- Why are you
showing this to me?

20:26.486 --> 20:29.445
I'm not showing you anything.

20:29.489 --> 20:32.013
All of this
is coming from you.

20:32.056 --> 20:35.103
- No, it's not.
No, it's not.

20:35.146 --> 20:36.583
No...
No, it's not.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.715
- Look deep within,
Barry Allen.

20:38.759 --> 20:41.892
This is your mind,
your visions,

20:41.936 --> 20:45.331
your doubt.

20:45.374 --> 20:47.768
- We all die without you.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.556
- You leave me alone forever.

20:56.516 --> 21:00.607
- Your city will burn.

21:03.566 --> 21:08.179
- She's even faster than ever.

21:09.703 --> 21:12.880
The negative Speed Forces
were too much, even for me,

21:12.923 --> 21:17.450
and now, Barry,
everyone is dead.

21:21.323 --> 21:23.412
- It doesn't have
to be like this, Barry.

21:23.456 --> 21:25.675
Here, let me show you.

21:31.594 --> 21:34.989
Accept my lifeblood,
and you could use it to achieve

21:35.032 --> 21:38.122
so much more
than I ever could.

21:54.443 --> 21:58.795
Become a hero beyond
your wildest dreams.

22:27.650 --> 22:30.436
- The power to
strike down death,

22:30.479 --> 22:31.959
life eternal,

22:32.002 --> 22:36.529
the grand miracle
at your command.

22:36.572 --> 22:40.881
Save the world and live.

22:40.924 --> 22:43.536
Have all you want.

23:03.947 --> 23:07.690
- She's so beautiful.

23:09.126 --> 23:11.825
- Embrace it, Barry.

23:11.868 --> 23:15.524
Just confess the truth.

23:15.568 --> 23:18.092
Do you have doubts?

23:18.135 --> 23:19.963
I do.

23:20.007 --> 23:22.966
- It's a beautiful life, Barry.

23:23.010 --> 23:26.753
All you have to do
is choose it.

23:34.935 --> 23:37.894
Choose life.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.439
- Barry...

24:01.265 --> 24:03.703
You must
gather your strength.

24:03.746 --> 24:07.794
Focus.
Time is running out.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.498
- Thought you all
would want to see this.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.936
Witnesses heard
the explosion

24:19.980 --> 24:22.025
but didn't
see much else.

24:22.069 --> 24:25.159
- There's gotta be at least
half a dozen cameras

24:25.202 --> 24:26.682
covering this lot. I--

24:26.726 --> 24:28.945
- And not one of them caught
anyone entering or exiting

24:28.989 --> 24:31.948
the scene when
this all went down.

24:31.992 --> 24:34.647
It's like a ghost
did this.

24:37.563 --> 24:39.434
- So the guy
you questioned was killed

24:39.478 --> 24:43.351
in the same lot you
questioned him on the same day.

24:43.394 --> 24:46.528
- Yeah.
- It gets worse.

24:46.572 --> 24:48.661
This blew away from the scene.

24:48.704 --> 24:51.577
I thought about turning it in
to the cops, but I only saw it

24:51.620 --> 24:53.666
because there's some major UV
energy coming off this thing.

24:53.709 --> 24:56.538
- You can see that?

24:56.582 --> 24:58.714
- Boss, this really
feels like a job

24:58.758 --> 25:01.456
for your husband's friend.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.024
- Oh, no, Kamilla knows
that Barry's the Flash.

25:04.067 --> 25:06.417
- Seriously?

25:06.461 --> 25:07.549
Since when?

25:07.593 --> 25:09.856
- Last summer.
Cisco used to be Vibe.

25:09.899 --> 25:12.946
- Okay, look, guys,
I think this mystery

25:12.989 --> 25:16.079
goes a lot deeper
than we thought.

25:16.123 --> 25:18.038
- And it's a lot
more dangerous.

25:18.081 --> 25:20.693
- So if you guys
wanna walk away--

25:20.736 --> 25:22.564
- Not a chance.

25:22.608 --> 25:25.132
- That makes two of us.

25:25.175 --> 25:29.528
- Well, Boss, looks like
Team Citizen has a new mission.

25:42.366 --> 25:46.196
- It's okay, Barry.
I'm here.

25:46.240 --> 25:49.199
I'm sorry it took me
so long to find you.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.028
Ramsey's infection is
stronger than anything

25:52.072 --> 25:53.726
we've ever faced,

25:53.769 --> 25:57.077
and it's only getting stronger.

26:04.084 --> 26:06.216
I think I know why.

26:08.697 --> 26:09.785
- You feel doubt.

26:12.092 --> 26:14.137
- I do.

26:14.181 --> 26:16.357
- You've answered
our call before.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.795
It's always been difficult.

26:19.839 --> 26:22.624
What's changed?

26:22.668 --> 26:25.758
- I've lived more.

26:25.801 --> 26:28.543
I've gotten married,

26:28.587 --> 26:32.547
seen a future where I'll have

26:32.591 --> 26:36.682
a daughter who's the best
of me and Iris combined.

26:40.076 --> 26:44.298
Most of my life has been
driven by my past, but--

26:44.341 --> 26:46.517
but now, I--

26:47.344 --> 26:50.609
It finally feels like
I'm living for myself.

26:52.915 --> 26:58.138
I don't wanna leave my family
or my friends.

27:01.794 --> 27:04.840
I don't want to die.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.888
I know that's selfish.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.588
I'm sorry I let you down.

27:13.632 --> 27:14.981
- Barry.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.897
No person is immune
to fear and doubt...

27:18.811 --> 27:21.248
No matter how brave...

27:21.291 --> 27:24.730
That's what makes
you human, Barry.

27:24.773 --> 27:27.297
But the courage
to move forward,

27:27.341 --> 27:30.866
even in the face
of overwhelming odds,

27:30.910 --> 27:33.869
that's what makes you a hero.

27:33.913 --> 27:36.480
That's what
makes you the Flash.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.748
- Thank you.

27:42.791 --> 27:44.793
I needed to hear that.

27:47.883 --> 27:49.885
- Don't blame yourself.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.846
- His lies...

27:54.847 --> 27:58.807
They were
so convincing.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.463
- That's because he never lied.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.729
- What do you mean?

28:08.991 --> 28:11.864
- That's what makes
Ramsey so dangerous.

28:11.907 --> 28:15.824
He manipulates the truth
to spread his disease.

28:17.957 --> 28:19.785
- What, so--

28:19.828 --> 28:21.830
so the part about

28:21.874 --> 28:26.182
his cells allowing me to save
the world from Crisis and...

28:27.967 --> 28:31.361
Still survive is true?

28:31.405 --> 28:33.973
- Yes.

28:34.016 --> 28:36.236
But that path's not for you.

28:36.279 --> 28:38.629
- Why not?

28:38.673 --> 28:40.153
- Barry,
you must understand--

28:40.196 --> 28:42.895
- That you want me to
leave behind everyone I love

28:42.938 --> 28:44.897
when there's a way to save me?

28:51.991 --> 28:53.296
- What is it?

28:53.340 --> 28:54.994
- It's Barry's sleep monitor.
This can't be right.

28:55.037 --> 28:56.865
His vitals are spiking.

28:58.432 --> 29:01.087
- Barry, your fever is rising.
You must calm down.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.784
- Stop telling me what to do!

29:09.138 --> 29:10.574
- His temperature
is burning up.

29:10.618 --> 29:11.793
- Why isn't he speed-healing?

29:11.837 --> 29:15.928
- I've seen this fever before.

29:15.971 --> 29:17.930
He's being taken over

29:17.973 --> 29:20.584
right now.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.677
- His temperature is rising.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.244
We could really use some
cold powers right about now.

29:28.288 --> 29:29.768
- No, Ramsey's infection
doesn't respond to ice.

29:29.811 --> 29:31.204
We need to
treat him medicinally.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.902
Inserting 10ccs
of naproxen sodium.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.826
All my pain,
all my suffering,

29:44.870 --> 29:47.220
it's been because of you

29:47.263 --> 29:49.788
because you would rather
I be the Flash

29:49.831 --> 29:51.180
than have anything
that I want!

29:51.224 --> 29:52.834
- Barry, please.

29:52.878 --> 29:55.097
I am not denying the burden
that you've carried,

29:55.141 --> 29:56.969
but the Speed Force
has only ever tried to be

29:57.012 --> 29:58.840
a guide on this path
that you've chosen.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.538
- The lightning bolt shot down
from the sky and struck me!

30:01.582 --> 30:03.453
I didn't choose this!

30:03.497 --> 30:06.152
You decided
to change my life,

30:06.195 --> 30:09.808
my family's life,
my entire future.

30:10.852 --> 30:13.333
This was done to me!

30:17.119 --> 30:18.555
- We need help.

30:21.123 --> 30:21.907
Frost.

30:29.871 --> 30:31.786
Frost.

30:31.830 --> 30:32.961
Frost!

30:33.005 --> 30:34.571
Hey, hey!
Hey.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.922
Just breathe.
Breathe.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.882
- Just breathe.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.231
Just breathe.

30:42.275 --> 30:44.843
- Please understand.
The role you play is vital

30:44.886 --> 30:46.583
to the balance of all things.
- Oh, stop.

30:46.627 --> 30:49.064
- There are
universal forces at stake.

30:49.108 --> 30:51.240
They must be protected.

30:51.284 --> 30:54.243
- What about the rest of us?

30:54.287 --> 30:56.289
- She's right.

30:56.332 --> 30:58.508
There are
universal forces at stake.

30:58.552 --> 31:01.337
It's just a pity she doesn't
consider your life among them.

31:01.381 --> 31:02.948
- Don't listen to him.

31:02.991 --> 31:06.255
He wants to possess your form
no matter the cost.

31:06.299 --> 31:07.604
- Cost?

31:07.648 --> 31:09.693
All those headstones?

31:09.737 --> 31:13.393
Those people are dead because
of my connection to you.

31:13.436 --> 31:16.744
How many times
do I have to suffer for you?

31:16.787 --> 31:18.920
When is it
your turn to suffer?

31:27.581 --> 31:30.105
Do you even feel pain?

31:30.149 --> 31:32.499
- No,

31:32.542 --> 31:34.153
at least not as you know it.

31:34.196 --> 31:37.286
- How could it?
The Speed Force isn't human.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.680
It doesn't know what
it means to be alive,

31:39.723 --> 31:41.987
to have a family, to love.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.336
It only pretends.

31:43.379 --> 31:45.251
- Ramsey's infection
is twisting your heart.

31:45.294 --> 31:46.600
You have to fight it.
Barry.

31:46.643 --> 31:47.906
These aren't
your true feelings.

31:47.949 --> 31:50.169
- What do you know
about the truth?

31:50.212 --> 31:51.997
This isn't what you look like.

31:52.040 --> 31:54.782
This isn't my old bedroom.
It's a trick.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.699
This is you manipulating me
so I'll do what you want.

31:58.742 --> 32:00.396
- That's not true.
I care about you.

32:00.440 --> 32:02.094
- All it cares about
is using you.

32:02.137 --> 32:05.227
- Barry, you must listen to me.
- No, I don't!

32:05.271 --> 32:07.273
You're not my mom.

32:07.316 --> 32:10.102
You're the reason I buried her.

32:23.245 --> 32:24.812
Barry!

32:24.855 --> 32:28.120
No!

32:51.317 --> 32:54.798
- The Monitor,
Thawne, the Speed Force,

32:54.842 --> 32:57.105
for too long,
others have used you.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.716
Take command of your life!

33:03.111 --> 33:04.330
Forever.

33:23.175 --> 33:26.134
- No, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, I have to.

33:26.178 --> 33:28.354
It's the only way to survive.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.398
- We don't have much time
until he returns.

33:29.442 --> 33:30.834
Barry, look at me.

33:30.878 --> 33:32.575
Accepting Ramsey's blood
would save your body

33:32.619 --> 33:35.143
from the coming Crisis
but not your soul.

33:35.187 --> 33:38.581
You would lose the best of you:
your joy,

33:38.625 --> 33:41.106
your passion,
your light,

33:41.149 --> 33:42.542
the part of you
that Iris loves.

33:46.372 --> 33:49.027
- Don't listen to it.
It lies.

33:51.203 --> 33:53.161
- Come on!
Barry!

34:04.259 --> 34:06.087
- Only you can
defeat this, Barry.

34:06.131 --> 34:08.089
- The choice is yours.

34:23.322 --> 34:25.759
- You beat it.

34:25.802 --> 34:30.024
- Took me a while,
but, yeah, I beat it.

35:01.316 --> 35:06.147
My name is Iris West-Allen
and I once met a young man,

35:06.191 --> 35:09.237
a superhero
who I called the Streak.

35:09.281 --> 35:13.241
The world has come to know him
as the Fastest Man Alive,

35:13.285 --> 35:17.419
the Scarlet Speedster,
the Flash.

35:18.942 --> 35:21.249
But no matter what title
you choose for him,

35:21.293 --> 35:23.251
he'll always be remembered
as the protector

35:23.295 --> 35:26.733
of our amazing city
and its citizens,

35:26.776 --> 35:29.344
as a beacon of hope
for us all,

35:29.388 --> 35:31.085
and as the man
who sacrificed himself

35:31.129 --> 35:34.088
again and again
so we could live.

35:38.092 --> 35:42.357
Today we say good-bye to him,
not because he was taken

35:42.401 --> 35:45.099
but because
he gave himself willingly.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.885
And in the end, that's what
makes him deserving

35:48.929 --> 35:51.888
of the greatest title
of all...

35:51.932 --> 35:53.368
Hero.

36:52.427 --> 36:54.255
Mar Novu.

36:54.299 --> 36:57.780
You ran and ran
across infinite Earths,

36:57.824 --> 37:00.827
and now you've
nowhere left to run.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.964
- It was like

37:08.008 --> 37:12.404
being back in prison
only locked up in my own mind.

37:12.447 --> 37:15.494
All the terror I felt,

37:15.537 --> 37:18.279
the horrible things I saw,

37:18.323 --> 37:20.368
they were all there

37:20.412 --> 37:22.849
buried deep
inside me just

37:22.892 --> 37:25.417
waiting to come out
the whole time.

37:25.460 --> 37:27.897
Took a lot to win.

37:27.941 --> 37:31.727
Everything that
makes life worth living.

37:32.685 --> 37:35.296
Thank you.

37:35.340 --> 37:37.429
- You deserve
some of the credit.

37:37.472 --> 37:41.215
It takes something special
to beat a sentient infection

37:41.259 --> 37:43.478
that not even speed-healing
can cure.

37:45.175 --> 37:47.265
- Well, it's not over yet,
so let's get back to work.

37:47.308 --> 37:48.744
- Whoa, whoa, what do you mean?

37:48.788 --> 37:50.311
What are you doing?
Just get some rest.

37:50.355 --> 37:51.704
Iris is gonna
be here any minute.

37:51.747 --> 37:55.185
- Crisis will be here
in less than 36 hours.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.013
We have to find Ramsey,
stop him,

37:57.057 --> 37:59.189
make sure there's still
a world left to save.

38:02.541 --> 38:05.587
And away he goes.

38:08.373 --> 38:10.679
You wanna talk
about what happened?

38:12.551 --> 38:14.988
- I already talked
about it with Caity.

38:15.945 --> 38:18.339
- Okay.
What'd she say?

38:18.992 --> 38:22.604
- With Crisis approaching,
we decided it would be best

38:22.648 --> 38:25.041
if she handles
the medical emergencies.

38:25.085 --> 38:26.652
I'll take a back seat.

38:27.435 --> 38:28.741
- Are you okay with that?

38:30.264 --> 38:32.527
- It's what's
best for the team.

38:43.625 --> 38:46.759
- Hey, I got here
as fast as I could.

38:47.499 --> 38:50.893
How are you?
- Oh, I'm fine.

38:50.937 --> 38:52.155
Really, I'm okay.

38:52.199 --> 38:54.157
- Your husband
had an infection...

38:54.201 --> 38:58.336
It messed with his brain
quite a bit, but we handled it.

39:01.730 --> 39:03.428
Okay, well,
just to be safe,

39:03.471 --> 39:07.823
I am not leaving you again
for the rest of the night.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.745
What you working on?

39:16.789 --> 39:18.573
- Just running
some diagnostics,

39:18.617 --> 39:19.922
little maintenance.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.489
- Why don't you ask Cisco?

39:21.533 --> 39:23.273
We could go home,
spend some time together.

39:23.317 --> 39:25.363
- Why are you
asking so many questions?

39:30.106 --> 39:31.499
I don't know.
You know, sometimes

39:31.543 --> 39:35.677
the reporter brain
in me has a

39:35.721 --> 39:38.027
mind of its own.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.599
I will...
let you get back to work.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.789
Hey, guys.

40:03.662 --> 40:04.837
That's not Barry.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.808
Careful.

40:22.550 --> 40:23.856
- Hey!

40:24.726 --> 40:27.076
Barry.

40:28.687 --> 40:29.949
Hey.

40:31.516 --> 40:33.561
Barry.

41:03.548 --> 41:06.768
Welcome, my blood brother.

41:13.645 --> 41:17.170
I am the world's salvation

41:17.213 --> 41:20.478
come to save it
from all that ails it.

41:22.001 --> 41:27.441
Soon, the entire world
will embrace

41:28.573 --> 41:30.488
Bloodwork!

42:15.010 --> 42:16.534
- Greg, move your head!
