STEFAN: Previously
on The Vampire Diaries...

00:03.760 --> 00:06.240
As long as you're alive,
Elena will remain asleep.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.364
Once you bury a body,
the grieving process begins.

00:09.520 --> 00:12.842
Oh, I'm not planning on burying her.
I'm planning on bringing her back to life.

00:13.000 --> 00:14.684
- Who's that?
- It's my mother.

00:14.840 --> 00:16.204
JO: Lily fell in with a group of witches.

00:16.360 --> 00:19.523
Heretics are ruthless
vampires with witch power.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.767
Enough!

00:20.920 --> 00:22.331
STEFAN: The whole town
would have been slaughtered.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.608
CAROLINE: Pack your things.
Your family's not safe here.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.127
BONNIE: Surrendering the town
is not a solution.

00:27.280 --> 00:28.441
The deal has been made.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.284
We don't mess with them.
They don't mess with us.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.966
My mother's a lunatic
and everyone's too scared to stop her.

00:33.120 --> 00:35.168
I want to fight. I want our town back.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.560
(GROANS)

00:39.400 --> 00:41.164
No. Who did this?

00:41.360 --> 00:42.805
Who took him from us?

00:42.960 --> 00:44.007
Someone killed Malcolm.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.288
And it got me thinking
that if I want people to trust me,

00:46.480 --> 00:48.209
then I've got to earn it.

00:48.520 --> 00:52.286
I reckon it goes without saying,
I chose Lily.

00:55.320 --> 00:56.651
MAN: All right, everyone ready?

00:58.800 --> 01:00.404
All right, here we go.

01:01.360 --> 01:04.170
Okay, people, we go live in 30,

01:04.360 --> 01:07.170
so I need that media package done
15 minutes ago.

01:07.320 --> 01:08.731
Where are my graphics and B-roll?

01:08.920 --> 01:10.968
- Jamie, we're good on music, right?
- Yeah, we're good.

01:11.120 --> 01:12.167
Excuse me, Caroline?

01:12.320 --> 01:13.481
- Yeah?
- Your fiancé just called.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.846
What? He knows that I'm working.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.162
That's why he didn't ask to talk to you.

01:17.320 --> 01:18.890
He's being sneaky, but--

01:19.040 --> 01:20.849
But your paycheck comes from me,

01:21.000 --> 01:23.731
and you know how much I hate surprises.
Spill.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.162
He's curious what your schedule is
right before the wedding.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.891
- Why?
- I think he wants to plan a trip.

01:29.080 --> 01:30.491
To Mystic Falls.

01:30.680 --> 01:33.206
But he knows that we can't go back there.

01:34.000 --> 01:35.286
Um...

01:36.200 --> 01:39.647
I will handle this later. Thanks, Tony.

01:39.840 --> 01:41.126
Mmm-hmm.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.641
AMANDA: Are both cameras on?

01:52.120 --> 01:55.090
RYAN: First one's on.
And the second one's rolling.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.642
(AMANDA CHUCKLING)

01:59.880 --> 02:03.566
So a few weeks ago, the town
of Mystic Falls was completely evacuated.

02:03.720 --> 02:07.520
The story is that some natural gas leak
made it all uninhabitable.

02:07.720 --> 02:09.722
But there's been so many rumors,

02:09.880 --> 02:13.248
whispers and just strange things
happening in the night.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.561
Unexplainable things.

02:14.720 --> 02:16.848
Okay, tone it down, Blair Witch.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.084
Let's see what you bring me, huh?

02:20.280 --> 02:24.330
Full spectrum light, EMF meter
and a thermal camera.

02:25.080 --> 02:27.606
Courtesy of Uncle Fred's
graduation money.

02:29.720 --> 02:31.006
(BEEPS)

02:31.320 --> 02:32.731
Look how hot you are.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.331
You're hilarious.

02:35.480 --> 02:37.369
Okay, so this thing's supposed to beep

02:37.520 --> 02:41.002
if there's some spirit
or something supernatural present.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.085
You get this thing off an infomercial
or something?

02:44.240 --> 02:46.766
-(BEEPING)
- Wait, it's working.

02:51.560 --> 02:54.484
RYAN: (DISTORTED)
It's creepy but kind of awesome.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.526
It won't open.
There's no lock, it's stuck.

03:05.080 --> 03:08.163
It looks like there's a coffin in there
or something.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.011
Amanda.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.202
It's not working.

03:16.520 --> 03:17.567
- RYAN: Amanda.
- What?

03:17.720 --> 03:18.801
There's something behind you.

03:18.960 --> 03:21.406
What? Are you really trying to scare me?

03:22.960 --> 03:25.281
-(SCREAMING)
- Amanda! Amanda!

03:28.160 --> 03:30.686

03:33.400 --> 03:34.640
(WHEEZING)

03:35.120 --> 03:38.169
RYAN: It's okay! I'll get help, okay?
I'll get help.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.289
(RYAN SCREAMING)

03:40.480 --> 03:41.720
(SNARLING)

03:46.240 --> 03:48.322
Much better than those blood bags.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.720
(CONTINUES SCREAMING)

03:49.880 --> 03:53.362
No screaming, please.
How do you know how to work that device?

03:53.520 --> 03:57.002
I don't. But if these two could,
I'm sure it's idiot-proof.

03:57.440 --> 03:58.885
Let him go.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.930
Mystic Falls is ours now.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.845
And so is any human
who steps foot inside it.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.482
I said let him go.

04:10.560 --> 04:11.800
(EXCLAIIVIS)

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

04:34.520 --> 04:36.727
ALARIC: I want to talk about death.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.290
More specifically,
I wanna talk about what happens after.

04:40.440 --> 04:42.124
Now, I'm not gonna pretend
like my good looks

04:42.280 --> 04:44.362
are the reason this class is so full.

04:44.520 --> 04:45.726
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:45.880 --> 04:49.123
I've heard the same stories you have
about Mystic Falls.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.368
Ghost sightings, poltergeists...

04:51.560 --> 04:53.881
- MAN: Zombies.
-(STUDENTS LAUGHING)

04:54.080 --> 04:55.206
Zombies.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.010
Now, let's talk about it.

04:57.160 --> 04:59.925
What's behind all of these stories?

05:00.400 --> 05:01.890
Now, almost every single culture

05:02.040 --> 05:05.203
has the lore of a creature or being
that cheats death.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.680
Why do our brains insist on in venting
the most unbelievable things?

05:10.080 --> 05:12.242
It's because the reality of death

05:12.880 --> 05:16.168
is actually the most unbelievable thing
of all.

05:17.040 --> 05:21.443
Now, the most terrifying thing that
you're going to encounter in Mystic Falls

05:21.640 --> 05:23.210
is a trespassing ticket.

05:23.360 --> 05:24.600
(ALL LAUGHING)

05:25.360 --> 05:27.169
So everyone just stay out.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.764
(CELLPHONE RINGING)

05:34.360 --> 05:39.161
So, the great Mystic Falls evacuation plan
isn't going as well as everyone hoped.

05:40.000 --> 05:44.085
(CHUCKLES) Well, they turned it into
a ghost town. That part worked.

05:44.360 --> 05:48.285
Unfortunately for us, ghost towns
are like amusement parks for college kids.

05:48.440 --> 05:50.602
The Heretics have killed
10 people already.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.287
Two, last night.
Idiots looking for a ghost selfie.

05:57.200 --> 05:58.440
Are you okay?

05:59.280 --> 06:01.282
Damon told me
what you were doing in Europe.

06:01.440 --> 06:05.161
What, losing my money and my sanity
to a series of con artists?

06:05.800 --> 06:08.804
Yeah. Don't worry. I'm over it.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.968
It's okay if you're not, Ric.

06:11.120 --> 06:13.964
In fact, I'm a little offended
you didn't come to me first.

06:14.120 --> 06:17.602
What, you wouldn't think it's weird
that I'm trying to contact my fiancée,

06:17.760 --> 06:19.603
who's been dead for months?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.770
Honestly, after everything
we've experienced,

06:23.240 --> 06:25.208
it'd be weird if you weren't.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.365
Hey, Bonnie.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.411
Have you ever heard of the Phoenix Stone?

06:40.520 --> 06:42.807
STEFAN: Caroline. Haven't heard from you.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.729
I'm starting to think that maybe
you're just using me

06:44.920 --> 06:47.082
for random hot make-out sessions.

06:47.440 --> 06:51.570
Which I'm not entirely opposed to.
But, uh, give me a call.

06:52.720 --> 06:54.165
(BRAKES SCREECHING)

07:00.000 --> 07:01.286
Can I help you?

07:06.640 --> 07:08.165
It's okay, I speak mute.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.081
Just communicate what you want
with a series of grunts.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.248
(GROANING)

07:18.040 --> 07:19.724
You'll have to excuse Beau.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.167
He's not in the mood for glib jokes.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.084
None of us are, actually.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.360
(PANTING)

07:32.320 --> 07:33.651
I thought we had a deal.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.847
Yeah, we do.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.729
Otherwise I would be at home,

07:36.880 --> 07:40.646
not out patrolling the streets
to keep humans out of your minion's fangs.

07:40.800 --> 07:43.565
We found Malcolm in the town square
last night.

07:44.160 --> 07:45.650
His heart removed.

07:48.480 --> 07:50.244
- You didn't know?
- No, I didn't.

07:50.400 --> 07:51.845
Because we didn't do it.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.604
I'm not here to blame you, Stefan.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.969
I came so you'd understand
why we did what we had to do.

07:57.520 --> 07:58.931
What did you do?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.728
(CAROLINE GRUNTING AND PANTING)

08:03.480 --> 08:06.450
Sorry, love.
This'll only hurt for a second.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.209
What the hell is wrong with you?

08:09.360 --> 08:12.443
Someone killed Malcolm.
Lily needed to retaliate.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.048
Strange. You don't look like Lily.

08:16.240 --> 08:18.846
Yeah, well,
it's all in the lighting, darling.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.606
Look, be happy I'm the one
who grabbed you.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.327
I don't want to think what would happen
if the others did.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.126
I am the closest thing you have
to a friend in here.

08:27.280 --> 08:30.568
Well, fun tip. Friends don't really like
to be tied up with vervain rope.

08:30.720 --> 08:32.688
Hush now. Deep breath.

It's all right, you two. I've got her.

09:21.160 --> 09:23.811
Do you?
Because it certainly doesn't look like it.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.004

Just so we're clear,
I'm taking the master bedroom.

09:37.920 --> 09:42.084
Carol Lockwood and I had a little thing.
I think she'd want me to have it.

09:42.560 --> 09:44.961
Let's open some windows, too.
It reeks of dog in here,

09:45.120 --> 09:48.329
which is impressive, considering
Tyler's been with Jeremy for months.

09:48.520 --> 09:49.851
You killed him, didn't you?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.286
Tyler, no. Jeremy, once,

09:51.480 --> 09:52.970
but are we really bringing that up
right now?

09:53.120 --> 09:54.849
The Heretic, Malcolm.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.406
Lily came by earlier.

09:56.560 --> 09:59.086
She found him in the town square
without a heart.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.123
Oh, did she want that back?

10:01.320 --> 10:02.765
I mean, I think I packed it somewhere, I--

10:02.920 --> 10:05.048
You know, Lily and I had a deal.

10:05.560 --> 10:06.607
A bad deal.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.250
She took Caroline.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.201
What?

10:11.360 --> 10:14.682
To retaliate for breaking our bad deal,
she took Caroline.

10:15.520 --> 10:16.965
But you weren't the one that did any--

10:17.120 --> 10:19.043
Yeah, I know I wasn't, you were.

10:19.200 --> 10:22.921
Which is why you are gonna go over there,
and you're gonna fix it.

B, no, I'm not.

10:51.560 --> 10:52.607
Excuse me?

10:52.760 --> 10:54.569
I think there's been a bit of a mix-up.

10:54.720 --> 10:58.566
See, last night, I was in the town square,
minding my own business,

10:58.800 --> 11:02.566
when I tripped and accidentally
ripped Malcolm's heart out.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.604
Deflecting. Of course.

11:06.080 --> 11:07.445
You never could admit when you were wrong.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.961
Okay, wait, I admit it. I killed him.

11:10.760 --> 11:13.764
I killed him in cold blood.
Just like that.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.447
Stefan and Caroline
had nothing to do with it.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.284
So if you'll just kindly let her go--

11:19.440 --> 11:21.363
Malcolm was a very powerful Heretic,
Damon.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.488
I have a hard time believing
you acted alone.

11:23.640 --> 11:25.608
Well, I'm pretty awesome.

11:25.800 --> 11:29.282
In fact, so awesome that
I'm such a better hostage than Blondie.

11:29.440 --> 11:31.602
So if you'll just swap us out--

11:31.760 --> 11:35.287
I'm afraid my family finds you
much less awesome than you do.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.000
Wait-- (G RU NTS)

11:38.800 --> 11:42.521
That's odd.
Why can't I walk into my own house?

11:43.640 --> 11:45.802
Because this is no longer your house.

11:45.960 --> 11:48.042
And I have the deed to prove it.

11:50.880 --> 11:55.647
Now, if you don't mind.
I have to get ready to go bury my son.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.891
An old contact of mine at Duke
told me about it.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.882
It's supposed to have
resuscitative powers.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.809
BONNIE: "Resuscitative"?

12:14.080 --> 12:15.889
As in, it can bring somebody
back from the dead?

12:16.040 --> 12:19.169
And that's why I didn't tell you,
because I was avoiding that look.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.004
Where did you find it?

12:21.920 --> 12:23.331
Well, you remember that night in New York?

12:23.480 --> 12:26.927
Yeah, the night that you passed out
on the floor of the bar.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.004
The night you pretended to pass out
on the floor of the bar.

12:31.160 --> 12:34.323
Right, well,
I snuck into the maritime museum

12:34.560 --> 12:36.722
because this was on display there.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.844
It's certainly pretty.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.366
I don't feel any magic emanating from it.

12:50.360 --> 12:54.046
Well, you are officially more honest
than anyone I saw in Europe.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.685
What are you doing?

13:00.880 --> 13:04.930
Sometimes witches will conceal
a powerful talisman or a relic

13:05.120 --> 13:07.282
by hiding the magic inside of it.

13:18.880 --> 13:20.405
Bonnie, are you okay?

13:20.560 --> 13:22.608
(SCREAMING)

13:23.200 --> 13:25.407
Bonnie. What happened?

13:26.080 --> 13:27.411
I don't know.

13:28.400 --> 13:31.165
I saw something. People dying.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.731
There's something wrong
with that stone, Ric.

13:36.240 --> 13:37.924
There's something evil.

13:41.080 --> 13:44.084
But your friend from Duke told you that,
didn't she?

13:44.480 --> 13:47.768
Which is why you waited
until you were flat out desperate

13:47.920 --> 13:49.843
before you told me about it.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.807
You can't mess with that magic, Ric.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.004
We have to destroy it.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.002
I only hear one set of footsteps.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.966
And I only hear
righteous "I told you so's."

14:05.160 --> 14:07.288
Look, I offered myself. Lily declined.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.602
Oh, well, it looks like
nobody wants you around, do they?

14:09.760 --> 14:12.843
Oh, planning a little midnight raid
into the tunnels?

14:13.440 --> 14:16.364
There might be a little, tiny problem
with that.

14:16.600 --> 14:18.443
We no longer own the house.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.690
L.e., we can't get in.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.450
- What?
- Have no fear.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.162
I have a call in
with the registrar's office.

14:25.320 --> 14:28.961
And I will find out who exactly does own
the house in a matter of minutes,

14:29.120 --> 14:35.127
at which point, we kill said person,
storm the castle and save your damsel.

14:35.440 --> 14:37.568
You're really enjoying this, aren't you?

14:37.720 --> 14:39.484
I got 60 years to kill.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.482
Having an enemy? A nemesis?

14:43.360 --> 14:46.204
A maniacal villain
with maniacal villain motives?

14:46.480 --> 14:47.481
You kidding me?

14:47.640 --> 14:49.244
It's not the worst distraction
in the world.

14:49.480 --> 14:52.165
You know, it's funny
that you think that she's the villain,

14:52.320 --> 14:54.482
when you're the one who killed
one of her loved ones.

14:54.640 --> 14:55.846
You're taking her side?

14:56.040 --> 14:58.520
No. But I'm definitely not taking yours.

15:04.920 --> 15:06.160
(GROANING)

15:13.000 --> 15:14.604
What did you do to me?

15:15.680 --> 15:18.889
What Lorenzo should have done. Vervain.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.727
It hurts.

15:20.880 --> 15:22.006
Yes.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.010
My family ran a slaughter house
when I was growing up.

15:25.160 --> 15:29.404
It was all well and good until they found
out I was a siphon freak of nature.

15:29.560 --> 15:32.086
Then they were more than happy
to hang me with the cattle.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.009
So, been there, sister.

15:34.400 --> 15:37.927
Just be happy I didn't hang you
by your feet like we do with the cows.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.849
What do you want from me?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.409
We have a burial to go to.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.082
My girlfriend thinks
her outfit has to be fashion forward.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.365
(CHUCKLING) I disagree. What do you think?

15:51.120 --> 15:52.724
Nora? Show us.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.886
Help us and perhaps I can find
a small stool for you to stand on.

15:58.200 --> 15:59.565
NORA: I feel silly.

15:59.720 --> 16:01.404
I'm sure you're beautiful, my love.

16:01.600 --> 16:02.931
NORA: Nobody wears this anymore.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.208
You wore that dress
to Queen Victoria's funeral.

16:05.400 --> 16:06.640
It's stunning.

16:14.560 --> 16:15.766
(CHORTLING)

16:19.400 --> 16:20.640
See?

16:29.000 --> 16:30.923
I asked for advice. Not mockery.

16:31.080 --> 16:35.085
Yeah, well, you should listen
to your girlfriend, because that dress...

16:35.400 --> 16:37.084
(SIGHS) Look.

16:37.600 --> 16:40.410
My best friend used to live here.
She had good style.

16:40.600 --> 16:43.524
And I'm sure that a couple of her dresses
are in a closet somewhere.

16:43.680 --> 16:47.082
I'm curious.
What do you think of this color?

16:47.920 --> 16:50.969
It's great, actually.

16:51.920 --> 16:54.764
Super vivid.
It'll totally make your eyes pop.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.521
Do you think it'll make your eyes pop?

17:02.920 --> 17:05.810
If you ever embarrass
my girlfriend again...

17:06.480 --> 17:08.050
(SCREAMING IN PAIN)

17:12.200 --> 17:13.440
Lorenzo.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.806
I assumed you'd be watching over
our houseguest.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.290
Yeah, that was the plan.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.444
Until she wrapped a vervain-soaked rope
around my neck and ran away.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.641
She escaped?

17:24.800 --> 17:26.006
Yeah, temporarily.

17:26.160 --> 17:30.131
Mary Louise and Nora managed to catch her.
Now it's a no-boys-allowed zone.

17:30.280 --> 17:32.203
Hmm. How unfortunate for her.

17:33.640 --> 17:34.880
You promised she wouldn't be hurt.

17:35.040 --> 17:37.486
After you promised she wouldn't escape.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.802
We're leaving for the cemetery
in a few hours.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.201
I'm sure she can survive until then.

17:45.320 --> 17:48.802
I'd invite you, but we need someone
to stay here at the house.

17:56.840 --> 17:58.524
(CAROLINE CONTINUES SCREAMING)

17:58.720 --> 18:00.688
I know it's not quite fair.

18:00.880 --> 18:04.851
But Lily usually lets Mary Louise
and Nora get away with murder.

18:05.600 --> 18:09.764
You can still get what you want.
You just have to go around her.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.889
Spare me the family politics.

18:13.080 --> 18:17.529
You chose your side.
Right or wrong, there's no going back.

18:17.760 --> 18:20.684
So I should condone
someone I care about being tortured?

18:20.840 --> 18:24.526
No. You should just stop caring about her.

18:25.040 --> 18:26.246
(SCOFFING)

18:27.680 --> 18:29.045

Destroyer of Dreams.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.761
So I take it things didn't go well
with Ric.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.126
He wants to bring Jo back to life

18:41.280 --> 18:43.442
with a stone that's filled
with evil incarnate.

18:43.640 --> 18:45.244
Yep, sounds about right.

18:45.400 --> 18:48.563
So, about how long do we have
before this evil engulfs the world?

18:48.720 --> 18:50.051
Just trying to plan my week.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.282
I convinced him to drop it
in a vat of acid.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.881
So I think we're good. How are you?

18:55.200 --> 18:58.602
Oh, you know, just trying to figure out
how to break into my own damn house.

18:58.760 --> 19:01.047
I no longer own it.
Lily signed over the deed.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.810
Why would she do that?

19:03.160 --> 19:06.801
Probably because she didn't want us
to rescue Caroline.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.445
She took Caroline?

19:08.600 --> 19:10.284
When ? Why didn't you tell me ?

19:10.440 --> 19:11.965
Because I'm gonna get her back.

19:12.120 --> 19:14.726
And I didn't want you to do
the very thing that you're about to do.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.491
- It's because we killed Malcolm.
- Yeah, there she goes.

19:17.640 --> 19:18.766
This is all my fault.

19:18.920 --> 19:20.922
Listen to me.
Killing Malcolm is classic Damon.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.651
It has nothing to do with you.
Everybody knows that.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.086
You're covering for me?

19:25.240 --> 19:26.844
Because I need your head in the game, Bon.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.800
I have a mission for you.
It involves the person who owns my house.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.440
Hey. Hey, whoa!

19:45.640 --> 19:46.766
Hey-

19:46.920 --> 19:47.967
Not a Heretic.

19:48.160 --> 19:49.605
Sorry. Rough day.

19:50.280 --> 19:54.205
Well, not to be the bearer of bad news,
but it's about to get rougher.

19:57.440 --> 19:59.442
So I own the Salvatore House?

19:59.600 --> 20:00.840
It's pretty brilliant, really.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.447
They drain the vervain from your blood,
compel you to sign the deed,

20:04.640 --> 20:06.961
compel you to not invite
Stefan and Damon in,

20:07.120 --> 20:09.566
and compel you to forget
any of it ever happened.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.802
And bingo,
the house is an impenetrable fortress

20:11.960 --> 20:13.325
and vampires can't rescue Caroline.

20:13.520 --> 20:16.842
Great. So the only way to break the seal
is for me to die.

20:18.000 --> 20:21.243
Bon, please tell me
that that's not the plan.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.806
What do you think about
letting me use magic to stop your heart?

20:26.880 --> 20:28.166
(SIGHS)

20:34.800 --> 20:36.211
So you're gonna kill me?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.407
Temporarily.

20:37.560 --> 20:39.324
But won't it reset when I wake up?

20:39.480 --> 20:41.926
No. Once you die,
the threshold spell is broken.

20:42.080 --> 20:43.320
If they wanna re-seal the house,

20:43.480 --> 20:45.482
they'll have to sign over the deed
to someone else.

20:45.680 --> 20:49.207
So Damon screws up, Caroline gets grabbed
and I end up dead?

20:49.400 --> 20:51.846
Doesn't it ever feel
like we're fighting the wrong enemy?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.367
We don't have time for a debate, Matt.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.163
Caroline needs us.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.010
Are you in or you out?

21:06.520 --> 21:09.842
Ouch. Nora or Mary Louise?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.210
- Mary Louise.
- Hmm.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.040
Lucky. She's the nice one.

21:16.680 --> 21:18.569
Yeah, not if you laugh at Nora.

21:18.720 --> 21:19.926
You didn't.

It would have been hilarious.

gonna stop it for 10 seconds, all right?

25:57.960 --> 26:00.964
Let's just say that Lily and I
have similar views on loyalty.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.322
You know she abandoned
her entire family once.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.641
Who's to say she won't do it again?

26:04.800 --> 26:07.041
She didn't abandon her family.
She merely abandoned her relatives.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.804
There's a difference.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.286
Yeah.

26:11.320 --> 26:13.004
One is a permanent blood tie.

26:13.160 --> 26:14.446
A name.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.161
A Iegafiy-

26:16.360 --> 26:19.443
In her eyes, Malcolm was more a Salvatore
than you ever were.

26:19.640 --> 26:23.167
Why else would she bury him
in the family crypt next to Elena?

26:23.840 --> 26:25.171
That crypt is sealed shut.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.129
Oh, right.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.889
Oh, well, then it's a good thing

26:30.040 --> 26:33.169
that she's mother bear
to a group of magic siphoners.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.005
A little gaudy.

26:51.680 --> 26:55.685
Pull out Elena's coffin and dump the body
in the river under the falls.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.523
She can spend the next 60 years
of her life underwater.

27:20.240 --> 27:21.446
(PANTING)

27:23.280 --> 27:25.123
BONNIE: Oh, no! Oh, my God!

27:26.560 --> 27:28.722
(CHANTING INCANTATION)

27:32.080 --> 27:33.570
Come on, Matt!

27:35.760 --> 27:37.091
(GASPING)

27:39.040 --> 27:40.724
-(GROANING)
- Thank God.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.123
Awfully long 10 seconds, Bon.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.440
CAROLI N E: Stefan ?

28:00.600 --> 28:02.648
Is it you or am I hallucinating?

28:02.920 --> 28:03.967
What did they do to you?

28:04.160 --> 28:07.721
You mean, before or after the gallon
of vervain they injected me with?

28:07.880 --> 28:09.564
Let me get you out of here. Just hang on.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.449
Already doing that.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.287
Looks like I might have to swoop you up
and carry you out of here.

28:16.440 --> 28:19.649
(CHUCKLING) Well, the feminist in me
says no, but...

28:26.800 --> 28:28.802
It's like your skin is vervain.

28:29.520 --> 28:30.931
Valerie's spell.

28:37.680 --> 28:38.966
Hello?

28:39.960 --> 28:42.531
Anybody burying somebody
nobody cared about?

28:47.640 --> 28:48.846
No.

28:55.520 --> 28:56.806
No.

28:57.200 --> 28:58.486
No.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.046
(GROANING)

29:02.320 --> 29:08.009
No, no. No, no, no!

29:10.800 --> 29:13.531
LILY: You always did throw
the worst tantrums.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.321
Where is she?

29:16.520 --> 29:18.363
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

29:18.520 --> 29:20.568
That's the fun of cloaking spells, Damon.

29:20.720 --> 29:22.802
She could be right next to you.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.527
Or she could be a million miles away.

29:26.880 --> 29:29.724
And I'm the only one
who knows where she is.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.689
You want to punish me for what I did.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.205
Fine. Do it.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.211
Punish me. Torture me.
Kill me for all I care!

29:36.400 --> 29:38.323
But leave Elena out of this.

29:39.680 --> 29:42.729
Do you remember
when you broke my grandmother's vase?

29:43.400 --> 29:44.731
What?

29:44.880 --> 29:46.723
You were young. Ten, maybe.

29:47.400 --> 29:48.731
You denied it.

29:50.160 --> 29:53.528
Even when your father
made you cut a switch from the yard.

29:54.680 --> 29:57.729
Even when he beat you with it
until you were bloody.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.726
Still, you denied it. vehemently.

30:02.560 --> 30:05.882
Just sitting there
playing with your little toy soldiers,

30:06.240 --> 30:07.730
bloody and bruised.

30:08.440 --> 30:09.851
So I switched tactics.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.889
And the next morning, when you woke,

30:12.080 --> 30:13.570
your room was bare.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.565
No toy soldiers.

30:15.760 --> 30:17.250
No toys at all.

30:19.200 --> 30:20.964
And you cried and cried.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.605
Admitted everything.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.724
She's not a toy soldier.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.082
And Malcolm was not a vase.

30:45.760 --> 30:48.286
Malcolm was a vital part of this family.

30:49.080 --> 30:51.447
He meant something to each one of us.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.125
He found me on the streets.

30:53.280 --> 30:56.602
He was kind to me.
Something I hadn't felt in years.

30:56.920 --> 30:59.571
He's the one who convinced me
to meet with Lily.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.449
My family wanted me dead.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.241
Malcolm made sure they didn't succeed.

31:05.400 --> 31:07.607
I hadn't seen Beau in a decade.

31:08.120 --> 31:09.963
Malcolm reunited us.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.168
LILY: He was my sounding board.

31:12.680 --> 31:13.966
My confidant.

31:15.080 --> 31:16.286
My eldest son.

31:18.120 --> 31:20.282
Ironic that you took him from me.

31:23.240 --> 31:24.480
All right.

31:25.840 --> 31:27.808
Tell me what you want.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.124
One of the Heretics was torturing me.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.361
The other one said that she would help.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.000
I just thought
it would only burn them, l...

31:40.160 --> 31:42.640
It's all right. When we get out of here,
we'll call Bonnie.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.451
There's got to be a way
to get rid of this.

31:45.680 --> 31:50.208
For now, we have to avoid
skin-to-skin contact.

31:51.800 --> 31:53.848
I know it's gonna be extra hard for you.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.206
(CHUCKUNG)

31:55.480 --> 31:58.290
I'm gonna call Damon
and tell him that we're ready.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.124
- Stefan?
-(RUMBLING)

32:00.320 --> 32:02.163
- Do you feel that?
- What's happening?

32:02.320 --> 32:07.201
I don't know, I feel like every molecule
of my body is being pulled.

32:08.320 --> 32:09.526
Stefan!

32:13.560 --> 32:14.846
(GROANING)

32:23.080 --> 32:25.003
Okay. Invite her in.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.884
Caroline. Please come in.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.087
(GRUNTING)

32:28.240 --> 32:29.765
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

32:32.840 --> 32:34.046
Sorry, love.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.201
I think we should go to the hospital,
just in case.

32:43.360 --> 32:44.566
And say what?

32:44.720 --> 32:48.725
"My friend used magic to stop my heart
for six minutes, how's my brain?"

32:49.200 --> 32:52.249
Matt, I'm so sorry. Okay?
I got hit with these visions--

32:52.400 --> 32:54.050
This isn't your fault.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.720
This is all happening because of Damon.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.408
That's the thing, Matt. It's not.

33:01.120 --> 33:02.281
What?

33:02.520 --> 33:04.921
What you said to me yesterday?
You were right.

33:05.080 --> 33:06.411
The Heretics are here because of me.

33:06.560 --> 33:09.723
And when I saw our town,
our home like this?

33:12.080 --> 33:14.242
I helped Damon kill Malcolm.

33:14.400 --> 33:18.644
And when I found out they took Caroline,
it was my idea to stop your heart.

33:18.920 --> 33:22.083
I refuse to stand by
and let them do whatever they want.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.240
I drive up and down
these streets every day.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.444
Streets that, for my entire life,
were filled with people.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.080
Families. Kids.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.760
And now, I pray that I see empty parks
and empty playgrounds.

33:37.920 --> 33:39.649
I pray that I don't see a soul.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.245
And I hate that.

33:45.240 --> 33:46.287
I hate them.

33:46.440 --> 33:49.762
Then why don't we stop fighting
and do something about it?

33:57.800 --> 33:59.165
<i>STE FAN</i> I <i>You left.</i>

34:02.920 --> 34:05.491
I could've gotten her back, but you left.

34:08.280 --> 34:09.770
What, no comeback?

34:13.679 --> 34:15.284
No funny reason?

34:18.480 --> 34:19.527
Answer me!

34:19.679 --> 34:22.286
Better get it out while you can, brother.

34:22.800 --> 34:25.007
I'm not gonna be here much longer.

34:25.159 --> 34:28.447
What the hell are you talking about?
Where are you going?

34:29.480 --> 34:31.527
I believe Lily's exact words were

34:31.679 --> 34:35.321
"As far from Mystic Falls
as humanly possible."

34:36.159 --> 34:39.846
Now, I'm no Google Maps,
but I'm thinking that's pretty far away.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.570
She has Elena.

34:48.280 --> 34:50.123
She's making me leave town.

34:51.320 --> 34:52.685
Forgood.

35:00.000 --> 35:03.049
If the roles were reversed,
what would you have done?

35:04.840 --> 35:06.524
She has Caroline.

35:09.000 --> 35:12.322
She has Elena. She has our house.
She has this whole town!

35:13.200 --> 35:14.929
She has all of our toys.

35:17.080 --> 35:18.320
Stefan.

35:18.520 --> 35:21.888
Whenever I did anything wrong as a kid,
she took my toys.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.090
But she also took yours.

35:24.240 --> 35:26.925
All of 'em.
And you'd cry like a little baby.

35:27.320 --> 35:30.369
I'd do anything,
anything she wanted, to shut you up.

35:31.720 --> 35:33.449
This is her plan.

35:33.760 --> 35:36.730
She's slowly taking away
everything we care about.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.524
She wants us to be mad at each other.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.286
You're right. You and I fight...

35:43.000 --> 35:46.083
While her and her family of freaks
live in our house,

35:46.560 --> 35:48.289
getting closer and closer.

35:49.280 --> 35:52.250
Fine. Then we don't let her fracture us.

35:52.520 --> 35:53.931
Or we do.

35:56.200 --> 35:59.090
You complain to Lily about
your worthless brother that left town.

35:59.240 --> 36:02.449
All the while,
I'm doing a little fracturing of my own.

36:03.760 --> 36:05.250
How are you gonna do that?

36:05.400 --> 36:08.609
There were four Heretics at the funeral.
Dead Malcolm makes five.

36:08.760 --> 36:09.966
But in 1903?

36:11.280 --> 36:12.611
There were six.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.082
Which means there's one more.

36:17.080 --> 36:20.323
And I'm gonna find him.
And I'm gonna negotiate a trade.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.608
We're gonna get them both back.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.603
- Did it work?
- ALARIC: (OVER PHONE) Yeah.

36:31.760 --> 36:35.128
Hello, hydrofluoric acid.
Goodbye, Phoenix Stone.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.760
BONNIE: Good. See you in class tomorrow.

37:35.320 --> 37:36.685
(GASPING)

38:23.760 --> 38:25.285
How was the burial?

38:25.840 --> 38:28.411
As lovely as a burial could be, I suppose.

38:32.720 --> 38:35.405
I noticed Caroline is still being held
in the girls' room.

38:35.560 --> 38:38.848
Would you like me to speak with them
about letting her stay with you?

38:39.040 --> 38:41.247
I don't need you to advocate for me.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.405
She made her bed.

38:43.560 --> 38:46.040
Perhaps it's time she should lie in it.

38:46.760 --> 38:50.242
What about your bed?
Have you decided which room you'll take?

38:52.240 --> 38:54.720
Do you consider me a part of your family?

38:54.880 --> 38:57.087
- Like the others?
-(SCOFFS)

38:58.640 --> 39:00.210
Why, yes, of course.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.207
I care for you as much as I do them.

39:03.480 --> 39:05.448
And therein lies the problem.

39:07.640 --> 39:10.405
I'm not here
to be one of your children, Lily.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.562
Then why are you here, Lorenzo?

39:13.920 --> 39:15.604
Why did you choose us?

39:15.960 --> 39:18.611
There was no "us" in my choice.

39:21.760 --> 39:23.000
I chose you.

39:25.440 --> 39:28.967
I'm here because of you.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.811
I'm taking the guest room
in the east wing.

39:39.960 --> 39:41.246
Goodnight.

39:53.600 --> 39:56.331
NORA: Don't get cocky.
You're still spelled into the room.

39:56.480 --> 40:00.280
But I figured you could use some space
to stretch your legs.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.767
And maybe give this a read.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.321
What is it?

40:07.520 --> 40:09.648
I know you think
Valerie was doing you a favor.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.649
That she's the nice one.

40:12.200 --> 40:13.326
And trust me.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.369
She's the worst of all of us.

40:15.960 --> 40:17.007
It's Stefan's.

40:17.160 --> 40:20.289
But she never goes anywhere without it.

40:20.520 --> 40:23.000
What is Valerie doing
with Stefan's journal?

40:23.160 --> 40:24.286
It's the first thing she looked for

40:24.480 --> 40:27.006
when we realized we were trapped in 1903.

40:27.400 --> 40:31.325
The entry for July 15th, 1863
should tell you why.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.563
STEFAN: I just had the strangest encounter
outside the county fair.

40:49.720 --> 40:51.006
I met someone.

40:51.200 --> 40:52.201
A girl.

40:52.360 --> 40:55.728
We only spoke for a moment,
but her name is Valerie.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.571
And she may be the most wonderful girl
I've ever met.

40:58.720 --> 41:00.563
CAROLINE: And we're out.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.203
Great show, everyone. I will catch you
at the Grapevine in a bit.

41:04.360 --> 41:05.771
I've got first round.

41:05.920 --> 41:07.206
MAN: Great. I'll be there!

41:07.400 --> 41:11.883
Okay. So, let's call my fiancé back,
and talk about this Mystic Falls business.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.082
And don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell him that you told me.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.284
(CHUCKLING) No. Actually, you got
another call during the show.

41:17.440 --> 41:19.442
Someone named Stefan Salvatore?

41:20.080 --> 41:21.525
It sounded urgent.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.362
Well, if he calls back,
tell him that I'm not here.

41:26.560 --> 41:31.248
And I never wanna hear the name
"Stefan Salvatore" ever again.

41:32.240 --> 41:33.446
Got it?

41:37.080 --> 41:38.730
-(SIGHS)
-(TONY GRUNTS)

41:39.640 --> 41:42.211
I'm sorry, that was a bit harsh.

41:43.240 --> 41:46.244
Tony? Tony! Tony!

41:46.480 --> 41:47.766
