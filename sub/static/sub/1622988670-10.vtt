WACKNER:
How many of his employees

00:10.445 --> 00:11.881
are we currently holding
in Cord's prison?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.926
Two, Your Honor.
Kewame and Andres.

00:14.057 --> 00:16.538
No, no, no, you have three.
Kewame, Andres,

00:16.668 --> 00:18.714
-and Matteo.
-No. We only have two.

00:18.844 --> 00:20.759
CARMEN:
Your Honor, we're certain
three youths were taken.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.935
-BELLAMY: Not by us.
-OSCAR: Your Honor,

00:23.066 --> 00:25.199
please.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.983
Do not fuck with me.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.376
No one is fucking with you, sir.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.598
You're done, Wacko, you're done!

00:34.164 --> 00:37.037
Canceled! Canceled!

00:37.167 --> 00:38.168
!¡Hijo puta!

[footsteps approaching]

00:54.358 --> 00:56.404
[sighs]

01:00.103 --> 01:02.627
We should probably get going.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.760
Are you all packed?

01:07.154 --> 01:09.025
I'm sure I forgot something.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.983
I'm just so tired.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.987
How much time do we have?

01:15.118 --> 01:16.772
The flight's in four hours.

01:16.902 --> 01:19.209
We should get going.

01:21.472 --> 01:22.821
"They do not move."

01:22.952 --> 01:24.475
What is that?

01:24.606 --> 01:26.825
-Stage direction from
Waiting for Godot.
-Wow.

01:26.956 --> 01:29.306
Educated and a good lay.

01:29.437 --> 01:31.308
[Diane chuckles]

01:35.399 --> 01:37.445
Meet me halfway.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.927
-[phone ringing]
-Oh, no. Tell them no.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.800
We're on vacation. That's why
we turned off our cell phones.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.497
-Might be your work.
-No.

01:46.628 --> 01:49.065
It's always the NRA
wanting you to defend

01:49.196 --> 01:50.632
the latest school shooting.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.112
Hello.

01:54.331 --> 01:56.028
Well, we were just on our way
to the airport.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.769
DIANE:
Tell them no.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.075
It's for you.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.686
[groans] Damn.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.210
-Tell them no.
-Hello?

02:03.340 --> 02:06.387
Liz, I can't. I'm on vacation.

02:06.517 --> 02:09.172
Change in plans. They're coming
in from the airport right now.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.001
Who is?

02:12.132 --> 02:13.350
STR Laurie.

02:13.481 --> 02:16.440
What? That's in two weeks.

02:16.571 --> 02:19.574
No. They heard rumors
that we were dysfunctional.

02:19.704 --> 02:22.011
-Oh, God.
-So they're coming in right now.
No, no, no.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.100
This isn't the one.
I need the one from May.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.102
They're coming in right now,
and so we need to show them

02:26.233 --> 02:27.582
that we work well together.

02:27.712 --> 02:30.324
Fuck. They're gonna want
to see a financial plan.

02:30.454 --> 02:32.282
Yeah, I'm working on a deck
right now. No, no, no, no.

02:32.413 --> 02:34.415
We need the-the last slide
there. Julius!

02:34.545 --> 02:36.678
Liz, we haven't agreed
on a plan as yet.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.723
Well, we have 90 minutes.

02:38.854 --> 02:39.768
That's impossible.

02:40.856 --> 02:41.726
No, only if you don't
get in here.

02:41.857 --> 02:43.772
[sighs heavily]:
Oh, fuck.

02:43.902 --> 02:45.208
We need to change a reservation.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.819
Make it an 8:00 flight
and pick me up at the firm.

02:47.950 --> 02:49.734
You sure that's enough time?

02:49.865 --> 02:52.694
Kurt, we are going
on this vacation if it kills me.

02:52.824 --> 02:54.826
No. No, no, no. Forget about
2020. It was a disaster.

02:54.957 --> 02:56.872
-Multiple indictments, nobody.
-Oh, okay,

02:57.002 --> 02:58.090
-all right, all right.
-It's a global pandemic. My God.

02:58.221 --> 02:59.831
All right, right,
what about this one?

02:59.962 --> 03:01.703
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
We can't use that one yet.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.357
-Why?
-Why?

03:03.487 --> 03:05.837
This is the first major
cannabis deal in Illinois.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.839
It's-it's like we put Ben &
Jerry and El Chapo together.

03:07.970 --> 03:11.016
Plum Meadow has a contractual
out if our client goes to jail.

03:11.147 --> 03:15.282
All right, look, our quarter
without it is a disaster.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.284
We go from $45 million
to $5 million.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.677
Yes, so we need
to keep Rivi out of jail.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.465
CARMEN:
Hello, Liz?

03:24.595 --> 03:25.901
Hey, Carmen, how did it go?

03:26.031 --> 03:27.424
Rivi wasn't at the bond hearing.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.426
-They've moved him.
-Oh, my God. Where?

03:29.557 --> 03:32.690
I don't know.
They seem to be playing games,

03:32.821 --> 03:34.866
moving him from bond court
to bond court.

03:34.997 --> 03:36.781
I'm trying, uh, Division 5 now.

03:36.912 --> 03:38.479
-Okay, okay. Listen.
-No, no, right-right here.

03:38.609 --> 03:41.917
Carmen, we are being reviewed
by STR Laurie today.

03:42.047 --> 03:44.789
We need Rivi out on bail,
and we need his contract

03:44.920 --> 03:46.661
with Plum Meadow Farms
signed today.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.184
Okay. I'll do my best.

03:48.315 --> 03:49.838
All right, you call me
right when you have him.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.407
[line rings]

03:53.537 --> 03:55.060
-MARISSA: Hello?
-Uh, hey, where are you?

03:55.191 --> 03:56.627
I-I need you to argue
for a continuance

03:56.758 --> 03:58.063
for Rivi's corner boy.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.717
I thought you were doing that.

04:01.458 --> 04:01.763
I was, but I am being yanked
around by the state's attorney.

04:02.981 --> 04:03.547
Well, I'm heading
into court right now.

04:04.505 --> 04:04.853
-Which court?
-Wackner's.

04:05.593 --> 04:05.984
That's not a real court.

04:07.116 --> 04:07.856
It's just as real
as a living room.

04:09.074 --> 04:09.292
Rivi's going to explode
when he finds out

04:10.032 --> 04:10.859
they're holding his man.

04:12.339 --> 04:13.165
I need your help, Marissa.
This is straight from Liz.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.255
-Get a continuance.
-Hey, let's go.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.039
-Come on.
-Okay, I'm on it.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.607
My farm is in Galena,
three hours due west Chicago.

04:19.737 --> 04:21.261
What crops is it
that you raise, sir?

04:21.391 --> 04:23.088
It's corn mostly.

04:23.219 --> 04:26.570
CORD:
And how much taxes do you pay
every year, Mr. Holzapple?

04:26.701 --> 04:29.573
That varies, but last two years,

04:29.704 --> 04:32.750
$10,000 in property taxes
for 300 acres,

04:32.881 --> 04:35.449
$22,000 in federal,
$18,700 in state.

04:35.579 --> 04:39.191
[whistles]
And, uh, what do
those state taxes go to?

04:39.322 --> 04:42.282
Police, government services,
pensions, transportation.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.197
CORD:
Is there much call
for transportation, police

04:45.328 --> 04:47.287
and government pensions
in Galena?

04:47.417 --> 04:49.811
No, that's all for Chicago
and Springfield.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.335
-What's this about?
-Our state.

04:52.466 --> 04:54.337
CORD:
So you're paying taxes
mostly for Chicago?

04:54.468 --> 04:55.991
What are these lights?

04:56.121 --> 04:57.906
-HOLZAPPLE: Yes, basically.
-They make you look pretty.

04:58.036 --> 05:00.256
-CORD:
And you're going bankrupt?
-Yes, sir.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.476
Our farm's been in my family
for three generations,

05:02.606 --> 05:05.043
-but if we keep going with taxes
the way we are...
-Mm-hmm.

05:05.174 --> 05:06.958
...we'll be bankrupt by 2022.

05:07.089 --> 05:11.049
And this is why you are arguing
for a division of the state?

05:11.180 --> 05:12.660
-HOLZAPPLE: Well, yes, sir.
-What the hell?

05:12.790 --> 05:14.226
-HOLZAPPLE:
Chicago and Downstate Illinois.
-Shh.

Have you noticed, you've been
swearing more and more?

05:33.985 --> 05:35.291
Yes. The world has required it.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.075
-What are you doing?
-I...

05:37.206 --> 05:39.164
I am judging.

05:39.295 --> 05:40.862
Marissa has issues
with the case.

05:40.992 --> 05:42.472
Really? Not Marissa.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.735
You're deciding whether
Illinois should be two states?

05:44.866 --> 05:45.997
-Mm-hmm.
-Sure. Why not?

05:47.303 --> 05:47.347
What's the point?
You can't make it happen.

05:48.609 --> 05:49.349
-Sure we can.
-No, you can't. It's insane.

05:50.567 --> 05:51.916
Insane is just one step away
from reality

05:52.047 --> 05:53.831
if you get people to believe,
and you know what

05:53.962 --> 05:55.355
makes people believe? TV.

05:55.485 --> 05:56.921
So that's the point
of your court now--

05:57.052 --> 05:58.706
floating conservative
trial balloons?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.142
It's not conservative,
it's not ideological.

06:00.272 --> 06:01.361
Hold on, hold on,
hold on, hold on.

06:01.491 --> 06:02.797
There's a farmer
with a gripe out there.

06:02.927 --> 06:04.451
I want to hear it.
You should, too. That's all.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.322
The only way to piss people off
is not to listen.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.411
-Okay, but I have to go.
-Where you going?

06:08.542 --> 06:10.326
-The other court.
I'm supposed to argue in it.
-Oh, God.

06:10.457 --> 06:12.154
-What other court?
-Oh, this woman
in her living room.

06:12.284 --> 06:13.590
-It's not important.
-It is important.

06:13.721 --> 06:15.940
You have a show now.
You need to protect your IP.

06:16.071 --> 06:17.420
Okay, this was fun.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.379
Please don't destroy
the country until I get back.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.206
-Oh, my God.
-All right, single file.

06:21.337 --> 06:22.382
One at a time, children.

06:22.512 --> 06:25.254
Is that what you're wearing?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.169
No, no.
I-I just raced over here.

06:27.299 --> 06:28.953
I... I grabbed a pantsuit.

06:29.084 --> 06:33.828
Okay, all right, so, uh,
we have 45 minutes to decide...

06:33.958 --> 06:37.048
All I'm asking is that I be
considered a name partner.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.963
You are a name partner.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.270
And that we clarify
our responsibilities.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.839
Diane, there is a split
in the firm that...

06:44.969 --> 06:48.625
You guys, uh, can... can you
step out for a minute, please?

06:48.756 --> 06:50.192
Thanks.

06:54.196 --> 06:58.635
The Black equity partners don't
want to be in your work group.

06:58.766 --> 07:02.204
Because they think they'll be
punished by this firm?

07:02.334 --> 07:05.773
No. That's paranoia.

07:05.903 --> 07:08.253
-We don't punish here.
-Of course you do.

07:08.384 --> 07:10.691
My fracking client,
my union client.

07:10.821 --> 07:13.084
The Black lawyers
who work on those cases--

07:13.215 --> 07:14.825
they're considered traitors.

07:14.956 --> 07:18.568
-Because those CEOs are racists.
-So what do we do?

07:18.699 --> 07:21.484
Only bring in clients who can
pass the racial smell test?

07:21.615 --> 07:24.269
It's okay if
you're a drug kingpin like Rivi,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.402
but it's not okay if you want me
as a lead attorney?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.491
Diane, this is not about you.

07:28.622 --> 07:32.713
I mean, why... why do
white people personalize this?

07:32.843 --> 07:34.628
Oh, now I'm just
a white person?

07:36.325 --> 07:38.153
What happened, Liz?

07:38.283 --> 07:41.852
Last year we were intent
on an all-female-run law firm.

07:41.983 --> 07:44.942
Diane, there is history here
that we are trying...

07:45.073 --> 07:47.510
Yes, there is history,
and I've spent 35 years

07:47.641 --> 07:50.339
fighting gender discrimination
to get to this position.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.821
And we have spent 400 years
fighting racial discrimination

07:53.951 --> 07:55.475
to try and, you know...

07:55.605 --> 07:58.347
Okay, all right,
now we have 43 minutes

07:58.478 --> 08:01.002
to fix race relations,
gender relations.

08:01.132 --> 08:04.092
STR Laurie's gonna fire
our asses, and you know it.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.181
Okay, well...

08:07.182 --> 08:09.097
Let's split the firm
down the middle.

08:09.227 --> 08:12.274
I hire half the lawyers,
you hire the other half.

08:12.404 --> 08:16.496
You hire the white associates,
and I hire the Black associates?

08:16.626 --> 08:17.975
I'm not saying it's good.

08:18.106 --> 08:20.064
I'm just saying
it's what we're left with.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.197
It's what we can agree on.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.202
What are you doing here?

08:27.332 --> 08:29.552
You need me.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.728
Look to your right.

08:36.559 --> 08:38.518
-What's going on?
-We're up next.

08:38.648 --> 08:39.997
I don't know anything
about this case.

08:40.128 --> 08:41.433
The kid didn't do it.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.435
He was a lookout
for the two other corner boys.

08:43.566 --> 08:45.525
I feel like I'm going onstage
without any lines.

08:45.655 --> 08:47.091

All rise.

08:47.222 --> 08:50.268

Justice Vinetta Clark presiding.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.792
CLARK:
Troy and Mrs. Harbor,

08:51.922 --> 08:52.967
face each other
and say after me.

08:53.097 --> 08:55.883
As God for Christ's sake

08:56.013 --> 08:57.754
-hath forgiven me.
-Some advice?

08:57.885 --> 08:59.495
BOTH:
As God for Christ's sake
hath forgiven me.

08:59.626 --> 09:00.888
That's the way

No.

09:25.477 --> 09:26.914
We're on it.

09:44.714 --> 09:47.761
Your Honor,
Matteo Vargas is a drug runner

09:47.891 --> 09:49.284
who works for Oscar Rivi.

09:49.414 --> 09:51.591
He has made our street
more dangerous and more violent.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.854
When the police arrested
his cohorts, he hid

09:53.984 --> 09:56.683
and threw away his contraband,
so the police overlooked him.

09:56.813 --> 10:02.602
We found him cowering on the
front lawn of Carmel and 71st.

10:02.732 --> 10:06.257
Our street has been
more peaceful without him.

10:06.388 --> 10:08.651
In the short time we've held him
in our holding cell,

10:08.782 --> 10:09.913
crime has gone down 80%.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.175
How did you come up
with that figure?

10:11.306 --> 10:12.481
Do you mind if I finish?

10:13.830 --> 10:13.874
As long as you can back up
what you're saying.

10:14.788 --> 10:15.179
Do you have reason to believe

10:16.398 --> 10:16.790
the prosecutor is not
telling the truth?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.010
Yes. This contraband he says
my client has-- where is it?

10:20.141 --> 10:21.446
CLARK:
Where is it, Levi?

10:21.577 --> 10:22.796

We couldn't find it. He hid it.

-MARISSA: Did you look?
-LEVI: Your Honor,

10:24.711 --> 10:27.278
-this is a defense trick.
-How is it a trick? It's...

10:27.409 --> 10:30.151
Uh, would Jesus call it a trick?

10:30.281 --> 10:32.893
Didn't Jesus say
"Show me the evidence"?

10:34.155 --> 10:35.591
Where'd He say that?

10:35.722 --> 10:37.071
[whispering]:
Thessalonians.

10:37.201 --> 10:38.638
First Thessalonians.

10:38.768 --> 10:42.119
"Test everything.
Hold fast what is good."

10:42.250 --> 10:45.209
Exactly. The prosecution is
accusing my client

10:45.340 --> 10:47.168
of carrying contraband,
so where is it?

10:47.298 --> 10:48.865
Levi?

10:48.996 --> 10:50.998
-He gave it to his cohorts.
-MARISSA: No.

10:51.128 --> 10:53.130
You said he hid it. He didn't
give it to his cohorts,

10:53.261 --> 10:54.523

I don't know how good it'll be.
We have Mr. ASA

11:10.844 --> 11:11.105
-back with us, too.
-We ask that bail be denied.

11:12.454 --> 11:13.020
Rivi is the very definition
of a flight risk.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.892

Mr. Rivi is now an entrepreneur

11:16.023 --> 11:18.373

-What fucking business?

11:21.071 --> 11:23.247
-Your Honor,
can we not resort to swearing?
-Mr. Carruthers.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.901
The business is
Plum Meadow Farms.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.555
They signed the contract
with him yesterday.

Ms. Moyo, I want
the Plum Meadow contract.

11:34.432 --> 11:36.043
Then I'll decide about bail.

to justify anything.

to have concrete...
-This is our street.

Yes, you do! You have
to present actual evidence...

We have a right to protect
our children, our neighborhood.

Please. Please!

11:46.183 --> 11:47.619
Matteo, did you have
any contraband on you?

-No.
-"Ma'am."

11:49.534 --> 11:50.971
No, ma'am.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.494
Then why was he here?

11:52.624 --> 11:54.670
Why was Matteo
on our street corner?

11:54.801 --> 11:56.672
It's not illegal
to be on a street corner.

11:56.803 --> 11:59.066
What did Jesus say?

11:59.196 --> 12:02.504
Uh... the corner is where

12:02.634 --> 12:04.245

[clears throat]

12:09.859 --> 12:11.426
Why were you on our street?

12:11.556 --> 12:12.819
I was friends with Kewame.

12:12.949 --> 12:16.257
And were you dealing drugs
with him?

12:16.387 --> 12:18.433
I want to warn you.

12:18.563 --> 12:22.089
God will look into your heart,
and his punishment is eternal.

12:22.219 --> 12:25.048
Okay, look, I know
Kewame was selling yayo,

12:25.179 --> 12:26.528
but I was just standing there.

12:26.658 --> 12:27.790
-That right?
-Yes.

12:27.921 --> 12:28.922
-And I held his gun.
-Wait a minute.

-Let me talk to my client.
-Your Honor,

12:32.142 --> 12:32.186
-what did he just say?
-No, he didn't really mean that.

12:33.274 --> 12:33.317
-He did not mean that.
-Your Honor.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.798
-It...
-Hold on. Hold on!

12:35.929 --> 12:37.844

you had in your hand?

to murder.

-As you know,

12:53.163 --> 12:54.469
there were two murders
on our street

12:54.599 --> 12:56.297
from narcotics trafficking.

12:56.427 --> 12:59.430
We'd like to investigate
Mr. Vargas for his complicity.

12:59.561 --> 13:01.041
You can't try someone here
for murder.

13:01.171 --> 13:02.259
I'm sorry. Why can't we?

13:04.131 --> 13:07.134
Because this is a living room.

13:07.264 --> 13:08.962
You're handing out cookies
at the door.

13:09.092 --> 13:10.920
You can't try someone
for murder.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.966
Those murders happened
on our street,

13:13.096 --> 13:16.099
and the police
haven't convicted anyone

13:16.230 --> 13:17.884
because they don't care.

13:18.014 --> 13:21.278
We care.
This is self-defense.

from your court?

22:04.453 --> 22:08.239

22:08.370 --> 22:12.243

to the police, not held here.

arrested anyone
