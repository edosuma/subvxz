00:20.562 --> 00:22.563
( jet approaching )

00:24.566 --> 00:26.567
( man speaking over radio )

00:49.216 --> 00:50.717
( chuckles )

00:58.767 --> 01:00.476
( car alarm chirps )

01:40.434 --> 01:42.185
( girl clears throat )

01:46.774 --> 01:48.357
Listen. Um...

01:49.860 --> 01:52.820
l had a great time
sitting next to you on the plane.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.582
Silver Lake, right?

02:17.638 --> 02:19.722
( pop music playing )

03:36.216 --> 03:38.509
Girl:
"Every morning as l drive away

03:38.677 --> 03:40.344
l am reaching back for you.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.221
lt is a helpless feeling,

03:42.389 --> 03:44.724
this wishing, this wanting,

03:44.892 --> 03:46.726
this knowing you will arrive

03:46.894 --> 03:49.687
just minutes after l have gone."

03:51.356 --> 03:54.150
Well, l thought that
was really freakin' good.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.987
Teacher: All right.
All in favor of including this piece

03:58.155 --> 04:00.072
in our spring issue, raise your hand.

04:03.577 --> 04:05.244
Nearly unanimous.

04:05.412 --> 04:08.080
And our author-- Kolt.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.917
Sylvia Plath would be proud.

04:11.919 --> 04:13.961
Congratulations.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.218
( exhales sharply )

04:24.890 --> 04:27.266
Thanks, dude.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.105
- Hi.
- Hey.

04:33.273 --> 04:36.275
- Um, hello. l'm Martine.
- Hello.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.110
- Hey. Hi. ( chuckles )
- l'm Peter.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.154
- Let me grab this for you. Come on in.
- Thanks.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.948
Julie can't wait to meet you.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.122
What's making you feel so powerless?

04:51.458 --> 04:53.250
l'm way too afraid

04:53.418 --> 04:56.379
to even approach a woman
that might be on my intellectual level.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.589
l know what you're gonna say.

04:58.757 --> 05:01.384
lt's not 'cause
l'm afraid she'll reject me.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.136
l'm afraid l'll reject her.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.139
Okay. Why is that?

05:08.558 --> 05:11.978
You know, a lot of smart women
think too much to look good

05:12.145 --> 05:14.480
and talk too much to fuck well.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.151
l feel like such an asshole saying
these things to a woman.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.905
l do get what you're saying, actually.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.326
'Cause the movie
comes out this week,

05:27.494 --> 05:30.246
everyone's acting like l'm supposed
to be excited, but l fucking hate it.

05:30.414 --> 05:32.999
And l wish l could say it looks nothing
like the script l handed them...

05:34.167 --> 05:36.127
but they didn't change
a goddamn line.

05:36.294 --> 05:38.379
l just wrote something
that isn't very good.

05:38.547 --> 05:40.798
We're gonna need to stop.

05:40.966 --> 05:43.134
( groans )
Don't do this to me, Julie.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.344
l will see you on Wednesday.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.477
( silent )

06:20.922 --> 06:23.132
There's a lot of life
that'll come out with the sound.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.010
There's-- you know,
like the bug's footsteps

06:26.178 --> 06:28.054
or maybe his breath.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.640
You know, what would it sound like
if you could hear the bug's heartbeat?

06:31.808 --> 06:34.935
Or, like, heartache.
What would that sound like?

06:35.103 --> 06:36.520
- ( chuckles )
- You know?

06:36.688 --> 06:38.397
Peter: Yeah.

06:38.565 --> 06:40.483
All right.
l think this'll be fun.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.235
Martine:
Yeah. l'm really excited.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.866
Thank you so much for putting aside time
to do this with me.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.451
- Absolutely.
- So you're working on, like,

06:50.619 --> 06:52.036
a big studio movie right now?

06:52.204 --> 06:54.246
l am, yeah.
They're not picture-locked yet.

06:55.999 --> 06:57.166
So you're in luck.

06:59.086 --> 07:03.214
Hey, Peter, is this
a take-from-the-fruit-bowl night?

07:03.381 --> 07:05.716
Martine, this is Kolt.
Kolt, Martine.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.009
- Martine: Hi.
- Hey.

07:07.177 --> 07:10.429
What is
a take-from-the-fruit-bowl night?

07:10.597 --> 07:13.432
Oh, it just means that
everyone's on their own for dinner.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.559
Nobody's taken
responsibility as of yet.

07:15.727 --> 07:16.936
( chuckles )

07:17.104 --> 07:19.271
Peter:
That's a maybe?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.462
- Hey, David.
- Oh hey, Kolt.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.714
Hey.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.676
l'm just getting out of here.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.596
Crazy plans?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.891
David:
Just finishing up some things for Peter.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.310
How about you?

07:58.478 --> 08:00.563
Lots of homework?

08:00.730 --> 08:04.608
Not really. l already did
this history thing that's due Friday.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.528
Well, it's good not to procrastinate.

08:07.696 --> 08:09.321
( chuckles ) Yeah.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.323
l do anyway sometimes though.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.826
Procrastinate.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.787
Oh yeah, of course.
l'm giving you advice l can't take, so--

08:16.955 --> 08:18.664
( Kolt chuckles )

08:27.465 --> 08:30.134
- Eating bark in a tree.
- Peter: Slow or fast?

08:30.302 --> 08:31.552
Fast.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.722
Wind, and also sand
blowing in the wind.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.143
Sounds that only ants hear.

08:39.311 --> 08:40.686
Ah, need to be more specific.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.938
- You know what? We'll come back to it.
- Okay, gasping.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.193
Sticky stuff.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.153
Bowling pins.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.155
Blood on pavement.

08:51.323 --> 08:53.490
- Got it.
- Really?

08:53.658 --> 08:54.700
Hey, come on.

08:55.702 --> 08:56.869
An old train.

08:58.205 --> 09:01.790
Okay, um, bodies rubbing
up against each other.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.543
Okay. So people having sex?

09:05.629 --> 09:08.547
Yes. But not like--
( grunts )

09:08.715 --> 09:10.549
Okay. Good to know.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.635
( chuckles )

09:12.802 --> 09:14.803
( crickets chirping )

09:18.225 --> 09:20.684
( door opens, closes )

09:20.852 --> 09:22.811
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, bud.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.357
- Hey.
- Hi.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.900
Julie:
ls she coming to eat? Where is she?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.568
- Jet lag.
- ls it gonna work out?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.862
l think so, yeah.
She's really sweet.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.739
- Good.
- l think she's really talented too.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.160
Hey, who is in the pool house?

09:38.328 --> 09:40.079
Her name is Martine

09:40.247 --> 09:42.706
and she is a friend
of my friend Miriam's,

09:42.874 --> 09:44.083
and she needed Daddy's help.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.668
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.586
My poem got into lit mag.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.713
Julie:
Sweetness, that's fantastic.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.382
- Did you call your dad?
- Not yet.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.717
Well, you know, he wrote poems
before he wrote songs.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.553
And maybe one day he will publish
some of those poems,

09:56.721 --> 09:58.681
and he can buy us a hot tub.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.976
( camera shutter clicking )

10:15.365 --> 10:16.949
( sighs )

10:42.976 --> 10:45.561
( phone ringing )

10:49.232 --> 10:52.651
- Julie: Wanna get that?
- Huh-uh, no.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.654
- You sure?
- Yeah. One of the kids will get it.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.614
No, they won't.

10:57.782 --> 10:59.950
They always let it go to the machine.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.453
And you never check the machine.

11:02.620 --> 11:06.123
- ( ringing continues )
- Wait. l'm coming, l'm coming.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.500
Hello?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.545
- Hey, Avi.
- ( chuckles )

11:11.713 --> 11:15.007
No, l don't know where Sea Horse is.
Hold on, let me check.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.387
Kolt!
lt's Avi on line one.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.639
l don't want to talk to Avi, Peter.

11:22.807 --> 11:25.601
Okay, why don't you
tell him that yourself?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.106
- ( beeps )
- Firm hand of a parent.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.817
- Julie: Oh, so good.
- ( snaps fingers ) Nailed it.

11:44.037 --> 11:45.913
Get the arm in there.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.796
- Julie: l gotta wash my face.
- What?

11:53.963 --> 11:57.925
- l have to wash my face.
- All right, the TV's going back on.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.177
Them's the rules.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.389
- ( crowd cheering on TV )
- ( sneakers squeaking )

12:03.556 --> 12:06.058
( announcer speaks )

12:06.226 --> 12:07.810
( snapping)

12:07.977 --> 12:09.978
( snapping echoing )

12:11.523 --> 12:14.066
( Martine breathes deeply )

12:14.234 --> 12:16.193
( squishing )

12:17.195 --> 12:19.196
( squishing echoing )

12:22.742 --> 12:25.035
( popping, rustling )

12:25.203 --> 12:27.413
( echoing )

12:27.580 --> 12:30.040
( echoing intensifies,
crackling )

12:30.208 --> 12:31.667
( mimicking popping )

12:31.835 --> 12:33.961
( echoes, distorted )

12:34.129 --> 12:35.879
( hisses, bubbling )

12:36.047 --> 12:38.298
( distorted bubbling )

12:38.466 --> 12:40.884
( distorted )

12:44.347 --> 12:46.515
( deep rhythmic thumping )

12:48.059 --> 12:51.270
( intensified )

12:51.438 --> 12:53.564
( school bell rings )

12:53.731 --> 12:56.191
Hey, where you going?
Class is that way.

12:56.359 --> 12:57.985
Oh, l'm not going.

13:15.920 --> 13:19.798
You want a section?
l don't read Science, Finance or Sports.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.843
Yeah, l'll take Science.

13:37.108 --> 13:40.903
So, um, how's it going with David?

13:43.281 --> 13:44.531
Hmm?

13:44.699 --> 13:48.494
Oh. Um, it's complicated.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.999
l mean,
there's definitely chemistry, you know?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.418
But the age difference.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.964
And he works for Peter, so--

14:02.217 --> 14:04.009
l think we're both just...

14:04.177 --> 14:06.929
a little afraid of where
it could go, you know?

14:09.474 --> 14:12.100
Well, it's good to be cautious.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.685
You have plenty of time.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.813
We're only, you know, 16.
( chuckles )

14:18.107 --> 14:21.193
( scoffs )
l hate it when people say that.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.370
( water lapping )

14:36.668 --> 14:39.670
( distorted )

14:44.217 --> 14:45.884
l don't know.
What do you think?

14:48.555 --> 14:51.348
Look, sir,
we don't need a pool cleaning.

14:51.516 --> 14:52.891
The pool is clean.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.851
- l'm looking at it right now.
- David.

14:56.854 --> 14:58.480
( scoffs )
No, you know what?

14:58.648 --> 15:00.899
Just forget it.
You're crooks anyway.

15:02.986 --> 15:04.903
My assistant.
He's a good guy.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.995
Dusty's been upset
about this dead lizard

15:13.162 --> 15:15.205
that's been clogging the drain
for like a week now,

15:15.373 --> 15:17.374
and l don't think
the issue's worth $600.

15:17.542 --> 15:21.295
Peter: This is our guest Martine.
She's the bug auteur.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.131
- lt's nice to meet you. Excuse me.
- ( water splashes )

15:25.592 --> 15:27.426
l love that guy.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.678
Every time we don't have
a big job going on,

15:29.846 --> 15:32.014
he just tries to fix
what's broken in life.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.266
My life.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.437
Okay, what's next? Chimes?

15:39.606 --> 15:41.481
( shower running )

15:54.746 --> 15:57.122
And that is the power
of directional microphones.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.999
They're kind of like magic wands.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.792
Here, come on.
l want to show you something.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.715
All right,
just lay down right here.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.720
Keep the headphones on.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.476
Close your eyes.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.440
You tell me--
what do you think you're hearing?

16:23.608 --> 16:25.484
- All right?
- Okay.

16:28.571 --> 16:30.322
- ( cars passing )
- ( rhythmic noise )

16:39.916 --> 16:42.417
l don't know.
That sounds like...

16:42.585 --> 16:45.504
a concert, but far away.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.340
lt's the highway.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.133
With those mountains in the back,

16:50.301 --> 16:52.177
it echoes through the entire canyon.

16:54.806 --> 16:56.515
- Wanna do another one?
- Yeah.

16:56.683 --> 16:59.101
Close your eyes.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.936
Okay, what about this one?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.022
( rubbing lightly )

17:11.280 --> 17:14.324
That sounds like wind
going through trees.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.159
l'll buy that.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.332
Okay.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.755
Tell me what you hear...

17:28.923 --> 17:30.465
now.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.236
( chuckles )

17:53.906 --> 17:56.658
- ( birds chirping )
- ( man speaking ltalian )

17:59.495 --> 18:01.246
But what kind?

18:11.299 --> 18:12.466
( scoffs )

18:14.510 --> 18:16.428
l'm tired.

18:23.895 --> 18:24.978
( man speaks ltalian )

18:28.733 --> 18:30.275
( correcting ltalian )

19:00.973 --> 19:02.474
David:
Hey, buddy.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.810
Hey!
Ah, you looking to brawl?

19:06.020 --> 19:08.563
You're Julie. Wow!

19:08.731 --> 19:10.565
- Can l hug you?
- Yeah,

19:10.733 --> 19:12.567
let's hug. l'm pro-hug.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.196
l can't believe it.
l'm meeting you--

19:16.364 --> 19:20.242
one of the original members
of Miriam's postfeminist wolf pack.

19:20.409 --> 19:22.327
l've seen pictures of you guys, like,

19:22.495 --> 19:25.372
sitting around swimming pools
looking focused.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.791
lt-it seems like it was an amazing time.

19:27.959 --> 19:29.668
- l don't know.
- Buonasera.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.837
- Peter: Ciao, guys.
- Hey, Kolt.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.841
Hi.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.927
Hi. l really like yourjeans.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.514
- Thanks.
- Do they have zippers on them?

19:42.682 --> 19:45.684
Um, yeah, they--
they do.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.270
- ( chuckles )
- Hey, you want to take off?

19:48.437 --> 19:49.938
Martine:
Uh, yeah, we should.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.190
He's taking me
to my friend's art opening.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.485
Yeah, l-l can't drive.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.238
l'm a New Yorker.
( laughs )

19:58.406 --> 20:00.866
l'm clinging to that as my excuse.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.868
- Can you drive?
- No.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.288
No, not yet.
But we will be practicing very soon.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.248
- Yes, we will.
- Okay.

20:08.416 --> 20:11.042
- You hungry, Sea Horse?
- Not really.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.878
Peter:
Hey, remember: 9:00 a.m. tomorrow,

20:13.045 --> 20:15.422
- actors.
- Yes. l will be there.

20:15.590 --> 20:18.008
And, Julie, l'm sorry that
we didn't get a chance to talk.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.301
- Oh, we will.
- Okay.

20:19.468 --> 20:22.137
Julie, is it possible to get my check?

20:22.305 --> 20:25.307
Yes. l'm so sorry.
l'll be right back.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.393
( car engine starts )

21:11.646 --> 21:14.230
( scoffs )
There is a mammal that lays eggs.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.983
Platypus, Avi! Platypus.

21:25.284 --> 21:26.910
l gotta go.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.596
( breathing deeply )

22:01.153 --> 22:03.905
( crickets chirping )

22:04.073 --> 22:06.074
( car approaches )

22:07.076 --> 22:08.994
( gearshift clicks )

22:09.161 --> 22:10.870
- ( engine stops )
- ( Martine exhales deeply )

22:15.001 --> 22:17.502
Thank you for coming with me tonight.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.422
No, thank you for bringing me.

22:43.821 --> 22:45.113
Um...

22:45.281 --> 22:47.198
l don't think

22:47.366 --> 22:50.577
that l should do this right now.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.874
Okay.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.044
l just-- l just got here.

22:59.211 --> 23:01.379
And l'm here to work.

23:01.547 --> 23:04.257
And l think it's smarter

23:04.425 --> 23:07.343
to forgo this type of--

23:09.722 --> 23:12.348
Anyway, this was really nice.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.517
Really nice.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.952
( both breathing heavily )

23:44.006 --> 23:46.007
( heavy breathing continues )

24:04.193 --> 24:06.111
( car door closes )

24:07.780 --> 24:09.739
- ( bangs )
- Ah!

24:09.907 --> 24:12.700
- ( cellphone ringing )
- Ah. ( hisses )

24:13.994 --> 24:15.411
Mmm.
( sighs )

24:15.579 --> 24:17.956
- Martine, you're alive.
- Doug. Hey.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.416
- Am l waking you up?
- Um-- God, no.

24:20.584 --> 24:22.961
l've been awake
for a couple hours already.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.464
- Everything going all right?
- Yeah, it's going great.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.175
( Doug speaks )

24:29.343 --> 24:32.846
Um, l haven't seen it yet,

24:33.013 --> 24:34.305
um...

24:34.473 --> 24:38.184
but as soon as l get my lnternet,

24:38.352 --> 24:40.562
- l'm gonna--
- ( Doug speaking )

24:40.729 --> 24:42.147
No. No no no no.

24:42.314 --> 24:45.150
Yeah, we'll definitely finish on time.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.609
Okay.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.319
All right. Talk to you later.

24:50.906 --> 24:55.410
Okay.

24:56.704 --> 24:57.954
( groans )

24:59.039 --> 25:00.665
Hi. l'm--

25:00.833 --> 25:02.750
l'm sorry l'm late. l, um--

25:02.918 --> 25:05.003
l couldn't find
the dialogue that l wrote.

25:05.171 --> 25:06.796
That's okay.

25:06.964 --> 25:09.340
Let's, uh, make
a couple copies of this.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.176
- Hi, l'm Martine.
- Hi.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.511
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Thanks for coming, guys.

25:13.679 --> 25:15.805
- Sure.
- Whoo. Okay.

25:25.316 --> 25:26.858
Patient:
So the reviews are in.

25:28.944 --> 25:31.654
Some great, some good,
a few really hostile ones, of course.

25:31.822 --> 25:34.490
How are the reviews making you feel?

25:36.702 --> 25:38.494
l don't want to talk about the reviews.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.663
Okay.

25:42.625 --> 25:45.001
l had a dream last night.

25:45.169 --> 25:47.503
Another one about your grandmother?

25:47.671 --> 25:48.880
No.

25:49.048 --> 25:51.507
lt was about you.

25:52.927 --> 25:55.053
All right.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.472
- Am l allowed to tell you about it?
- Of course.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.976
Um, l was on set

26:02.144 --> 26:03.728
in the house that we shot in--

26:03.896 --> 26:06.064
that weird glass box in the Valley--

26:06.232 --> 26:09.651
and David Strathairn was
eating cereal out of a megaphone.

26:09.818 --> 26:12.070
( chuckles )

26:12.238 --> 26:15.573
l had a break. Something drew me
to one of the bedrooms.

26:15.741 --> 26:18.201
l opened the door--

26:18.369 --> 26:19.744
( clears throat )

26:19.912 --> 26:22.205
You were lying on the carpet,

26:22.373 --> 26:25.750
and, um, you were
all dressed up in full lingerie--

26:25.918 --> 26:28.711
you know, lacy bra, a thong, stockings,

26:28.879 --> 26:32.590
those things that you use
to clip your stockings to your panties.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.093
- l don't remember what they're called.
- Garters.

26:35.261 --> 26:37.929
l was excited.
l walked over,

26:38.097 --> 26:40.598
started to touch you, softly at first.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.977
And then... more.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.104
You were just ignoring me.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.064
You were all dressed up
like you wanted to fuck,

26:48.232 --> 26:50.108
but you were totally unresponsive.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.903
( clears throat )
So l started talking to you.

26:54.071 --> 26:56.155
What were you saying?

26:56.323 --> 26:58.616
l just said, "Hey, baby, l'm here.

26:58.784 --> 27:02.120
We're not done shooting,
but they don't need me. Do you need me?"

27:02.288 --> 27:04.831
You still didn't respond.
l started to get upset.

27:04.999 --> 27:08.918
l was begging,
which is not really my style.

27:09.086 --> 27:10.295
l took my pants off,

27:10.462 --> 27:11.671
'cause l just--

27:11.839 --> 27:14.257
l just needed you
to know that l was hard.

27:17.803 --> 27:20.263
And l looked at you
and l said, "l love you."

27:22.516 --> 27:25.018
And then we were fucking.
lt was that easy.

27:27.354 --> 27:28.855
Woman:
Psst. Come over here.

27:29.023 --> 27:30.732
- Man: What?
- Woman: l found it.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.651
- Man: Where?
- Right here on the ground.

27:33.819 --> 27:37.280
- Man: ls it safe?
- lt's... sticky.

27:40.242 --> 27:41.784
Okay. Um, l liked that.

27:41.952 --> 27:43.911
Um-- uh--

27:45.331 --> 27:46.497
Ken.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.334
Ken, yes.
Um, l'm sorry.

27:49.501 --> 27:53.171
Um, l want something a little harder,

27:53.339 --> 27:57.508
l think, like you're
a protective husband, um,

27:57.676 --> 28:00.845
but you're a little bit scared?

28:03.182 --> 28:05.308
You're talking about
when l'm asking the question?

28:06.518 --> 28:11.356
Yes. Um, you're still soft and scared.

28:11.523 --> 28:14.025
Um, a little less blatant.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.943
Um, like-- like--

28:16.111 --> 28:17.862
like you're really
asking the question.

28:18.030 --> 28:21.783
But l'm asking the question
because l'm scared?

28:21.950 --> 28:26.120
Right.
Um, but you're not, like...

28:27.498 --> 28:29.499
sitting in your fear.

28:32.211 --> 28:35.755
Um, l just mean, like, um,

28:35.923 --> 28:39.008
y-your fear, um,

28:39.176 --> 28:40.802
it doesn't hinder you.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.221
Like, you fear,

28:43.389 --> 28:46.224
yet you're motivated by your fear?

28:46.392 --> 28:48.476
Ken: This is
what happened in the other scene.

28:48.644 --> 28:50.311
We did the eight takes of that,

28:50.479 --> 28:52.188
and l have no idea

28:52.356 --> 28:54.732
what the difference is
between any of 'em.

28:56.193 --> 28:58.569
Well, l think it's good
to just take adjustments.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.905
l'm not an actor
who minds taking adjustments,

29:01.073 --> 29:02.657
as long as a director

29:02.825 --> 29:05.243
is actually saying something.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.745
l mean, have you ever worked
with actors before?

29:09.748 --> 29:11.541
'Cause it seems like
your thing's bugs.

29:11.708 --> 29:14.752
She used to take naked photos
of her boyfriend.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.422
l Googled you.
l think they're really beautiful.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.507
Peter:
Listen, we really appreciate the help.

29:19.675 --> 29:22.051
All right, you're gettin' paid.
Why don't you do what she says?

29:22.219 --> 29:23.678
Ken:
You're barely covering my gas,

29:23.846 --> 29:25.555
and she's not telling me to do anything.

29:26.557 --> 29:27.598
( sighs )

29:27.766 --> 29:30.768
( door opens, closes )

29:33.397 --> 29:35.231
( Peter whispers )
l'm sorry about that.

29:36.442 --> 29:38.526
Martine: l'm sorry.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.450
( Martine sighs )

29:51.790 --> 29:53.291
You all right?

29:56.295 --> 29:58.796
Martine:
Okay, l'm not even that upset right now.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.465
lt's just like...

30:04.636 --> 30:07.763
l'm sorry, Peter. ( sighs )

30:07.931 --> 30:10.433
l really didn't want that to happen.

30:10.601 --> 30:13.144
What are you talking about?
You didn't do anything wrong.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.313
That guy just didn't get it.

30:17.441 --> 30:19.358
( groans )

30:20.527 --> 30:22.570
Ugh.
( sighs )

30:22.738 --> 30:24.572
Hey.

30:24.740 --> 30:27.283
Hey. Are you all right?

30:29.036 --> 30:31.037
ls there something else goin' on?

30:32.789 --> 30:35.625
( chuckles )
Then don't be so hard on yourself.

30:35.792 --> 30:38.669
- ( exhales ) Thank you.
- ( chuckles )

31:36.895 --> 31:38.854
( clatters )

31:40.065 --> 31:41.941
l heard something.
Did you hear something?

31:42.109 --> 31:43.776
l think someone's outside.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.991
lt's David.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.661
Okay, um,

31:53.829 --> 31:55.830
l should--
l should go.

31:55.998 --> 31:58.082
- l'm sorry.
- No. No no no. lt's no trouble.

31:58.250 --> 32:00.543
l don't even know
why you're wasting your time on this.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.795
l want to help. lt's, uh--

32:02.963 --> 32:04.630
l think you're really someone who's,

32:04.798 --> 32:06.757
uh, worth helping, so--

32:06.925 --> 32:08.634
okay.

32:14.558 --> 32:17.184
( clears throat )
Hey, brother.

32:17.352 --> 32:19.228
Hey, man.

32:43.295 --> 32:46.088
Julie: Hey.

32:46.256 --> 32:47.840
Are you a free set of hands?

32:48.008 --> 32:50.718
Um, yeah.

32:50.886 --> 32:52.678
l'm a terrible cook though.

32:52.846 --> 32:55.222
That's all right.
Just chop this parsley real quick,

32:55.390 --> 32:57.475
- and then you can get back to work.
- Okay.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.481
Julie:
Getting into it?

33:03.649 --> 33:05.650
What?

33:05.817 --> 33:07.568
Are you getting a lot of work done?

33:08.570 --> 33:10.905
Oh yeah, totally.
Completely.

33:11.073 --> 33:13.449
So much work, yeah.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.452
You know, l just realized
l saw your work once.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.540
At Miriam's.
You were staying there, l think.

33:22.918 --> 33:25.336
Oh yeah.
She let me keep my, um,

33:25.504 --> 33:27.963
stuff there
during the lawsuit.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.965
The lawsuit because

33:30.133 --> 33:32.593
your boyfriend didn't want
to be photographed?

33:32.761 --> 33:36.013
Um, well, l guess he felt

33:36.181 --> 33:39.183
that l manipulated him
into posing naked.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.187
- Ouch.
- Yeah.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.940
lt was not awesome, no.

33:46.108 --> 33:49.026
Um, but l learned a lot.

33:50.529 --> 33:52.446
We don't have to talk about this.

33:55.117 --> 33:57.868
So you used to live in New York?

33:58.036 --> 34:00.663
l did, yeah.
Where do you live?

34:00.831 --> 34:05.000
l used to live in Hell's Kitchen
with my ex-boyfriend,

34:05.168 --> 34:07.837
um, but l'm in Brooklyn now
with roommates.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.050
- Two roommates.
- What are you, 23?

34:15.053 --> 34:17.221
23...

34:18.223 --> 34:20.808
l was going to CalArts.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.643
Sort of.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.063
Why sort of?

34:26.231 --> 34:29.190
Because my main gig

34:29.359 --> 34:30.818
was being a girlfriend...

34:30.985 --> 34:32.987
to Leroy,
who you will meet tonight.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.408
lt's not a career l'd recommend.

34:39.995 --> 34:42.413
lt only took me...

34:42.581 --> 34:44.915
l don't know,
20 years to get my life together.

34:53.675 --> 34:55.467
Just keep doing what you're doing.

35:02.392 --> 35:03.601
All right, flee.
You're free.

35:03.769 --> 35:05.311
Are you sure you don't
need more help?

35:05.479 --> 35:07.396
No, this looks good.
l'll see you at 7:00.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.358
Okay.

35:19.409 --> 35:22.328
Peter: When did you find out
you were gluten intolerant?

35:22.496 --> 35:24.246
Man:
l was with, uh, Rod Stewart.

35:24.414 --> 35:26.957
He was, like, having
a dinner party or something.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.293
He was talking about,
you know, this whole gluten thing.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.462
l was like, "Well, tell me,
you know, what is gluten?"

35:31.630 --> 35:33.631
'Cause nobody really
knows what gluten--

35:33.799 --> 35:35.758
- Julie: l know what it is.
- Some-- l don't know.

35:35.926 --> 35:39.136
l don't know.
Okay, l'm in the bathroom, right?

35:39.304 --> 35:40.930
- And this was, like--
- Do you even know

35:41.097 --> 35:42.473
who Peter Frampton is?

35:42.641 --> 35:44.975
These guys don't even know
who Peter Frampton is.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.770
- Man: You know Peter Frampton.
- Julie: l know who Peter Frampton is.

35:47.938 --> 35:50.231
Man: But he doesn't know.
You never heard of Peter Frampton.

35:50.398 --> 35:52.149
No, l've never heard of Peter Frampton.

35:52.317 --> 35:56.070
But enough-- enough about me.
lt's not about me tonight.

35:56.238 --> 35:58.030
To Julie.

35:58.198 --> 35:59.907
- For giving me something--
- ( scoffs )

36:00.075 --> 36:03.452
No. For giving me
something like home.

36:03.620 --> 36:05.120
Thank you.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.998
- Do you still live in a bus?
- Man: Sometimes, dude.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.668
But hopefully not again this year.
l'm so sick of the road.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.963
( clears throat ) l'd like to say
thank you to Julie and Peter as well.

36:14.130 --> 36:17.341
- l feel very lucky.
- Oh, it's our pleasure.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.844
You're very welcome.

36:20.011 --> 36:23.347
- Julie, you look beautiful.
- Mmm.

36:23.515 --> 36:26.475
No, seriously. l mean, you look about
the same age as our daughter.

36:26.643 --> 36:30.104
- ( Leroy chuckles )
- l don't, but thank you.

36:33.024 --> 36:35.651
But you got this big guy over here, huh?
Mr. Handsome.

36:35.819 --> 36:38.028
( Leroy chuckling )

36:38.196 --> 36:40.197
So, Peter, um,

36:40.365 --> 36:42.032
l hear that your mixing board is

36:42.200 --> 36:44.201
where my practice space used to be?

36:44.369 --> 36:47.121
- ls that right?
- The room was already soundproofed.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.749
l'm glad someone's
getting some use out of it.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.126
- ( chuckles )
- Julie: Peterjust got

36:52.294 --> 36:54.003
- a huge studio movie.
- You're kidding.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.505
So he's gonna be
working down in Hollywood.

36:56.673 --> 36:58.465
- ls that right?
- Leroy: Amazing.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.551
That's great, man.
That's totally great.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.553
So, Martine...

37:02.721 --> 37:04.722
what do you make?

37:04.890 --> 37:07.850
- What's the inquisition?
- l just want to know. What do you make?

37:08.018 --> 37:11.186
Right now, it's, um--
it's images of bugs.

37:11.354 --> 37:14.523
- Bugs?
- A film, actually.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.693
Peter is helping me with the sound.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.196
When's your movie come out?

37:21.364 --> 37:24.366
lt-- it actually
doesn't really come out.

37:24.534 --> 37:27.870
lt's gonna be running on a loop
at her first solo show.

37:28.038 --> 37:29.747
A loop?

37:29.915 --> 37:32.082
Peter:
Which is at a gallery.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.918
lt's a big deal.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.753
Martine:
l don't know about big,

37:35.921 --> 37:37.713
but it's some kind of deal, l guess.

37:37.881 --> 37:39.590
Peter:
Come on, give him the spiel.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.384
lt's so much fun to hear
you talk about it. Come on.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.553
Oh, l don't know.

37:44.721 --> 37:47.723
You've got a great thesis statement.
Leroy would appreciate it.

37:47.891 --> 37:50.768
lt's basically, uh,
humans versus nature,

37:50.936 --> 37:54.605
and, uh, the personal
versus the...

37:54.773 --> 37:57.483
sort of intricate
complexities of community.

37:57.651 --> 38:00.319
Listen, at the end of it
what you take away from it is--

38:00.487 --> 38:02.154
What is that E.E. Cummings line?

38:02.322 --> 38:04.323
You can understand a poem

38:04.491 --> 38:07.493
without knowing what it means.

38:09.871 --> 38:11.580
( chuckles )
You shouldn't talk about work

38:11.748 --> 38:13.540
around the table anyway.
l learned that the hard way.

38:14.918 --> 38:16.126
( exhales sharply )

38:16.294 --> 38:17.711
Uh, excuse me for a second.

38:24.886 --> 38:26.345
So, baby girl,

38:26.513 --> 38:28.138
your mom tells me that, uh,

38:28.306 --> 38:30.849
you had a poem accepted
to a literary magazine.

38:31.017 --> 38:33.477
- Two actually, yeah.
- Leroy: Two-- wow.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.688
Beautiful and smart, huh?

38:35.855 --> 38:38.399
Excuse me. Excuse me.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.111
Leroy:
Tell me, tell me. That's amazing.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.862
Kolt:
Yeah, l don't know.

38:44.030 --> 38:46.490
l didn't think they were
gonna like both of them.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.247
( knocks on door )

38:53.415 --> 38:55.165
Martine:
Just a second.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.003
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, l'm fine.

38:59.170 --> 39:02.297
- You don't sound fine.
- ( toilet flushes )

39:02.465 --> 39:04.133
Leroy:
l remember once l was opening for Wilco

39:04.300 --> 39:05.676
and l couldn't remember a line.

39:05.844 --> 39:08.721
l sang, like, three songs--
l was just making up the words.

39:08.888 --> 39:10.514
l swear to God, it was awful.

39:10.682 --> 39:12.349
- Yeah.
- Peter: She's okay.

39:12.517 --> 39:14.727
What happened? l thought maybe
l offended you or something.

39:14.894 --> 39:18.272
No. l'm sorry.
Um, l'm impossible to offend.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.107
l just, uh...

39:22.110 --> 39:25.529
the tempeh was so good,
l-- l forgot l'm allergic to it.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.657
( chuckles )
Well, good. l'm glad you enjoyed it.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.873
Hey, l have a question.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.625
- Julie: Mm-hmm.
- ls Leroy ever gonna stop wearing

39:38.793 --> 39:41.837
flannel shirts and Doc Martens?

39:42.005 --> 39:44.048
l mean, the guy's like
a cartoon character.

39:44.215 --> 39:46.300
Or like an Amish person.

39:47.302 --> 39:49.636
One outfit? Really?

39:49.804 --> 39:51.388
l mean, he does have the money

39:51.556 --> 39:53.682
to get like a variety of apparel.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.019
l think the only reason
why l'm asking is

39:57.187 --> 40:00.689
l think l was legitimately confused
at dinner as to what year it was.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.691
So you wanna talk about dinner?

40:02.859 --> 40:04.943
What?

40:05.111 --> 40:08.864
You wanna talk about
your little crush on our houseguest?

40:09.032 --> 40:10.657
Excuse me?

40:10.825 --> 40:14.369
- What? Did you not hear me?
- No, l definitely heard you.

40:14.537 --> 40:16.288
What are you talking about?

40:18.083 --> 40:20.751
What do you have an issue with?
l don't have an issue

40:20.919 --> 40:22.294
when you bring
your ex-husband over

40:22.462 --> 40:23.754
and make googly eyes
at him all night.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.547
Give me a break.
We have a child together.

40:25.715 --> 40:26.757
What difference does that make?

40:26.925 --> 40:28.383
l understand you're attracted to her.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.261
She's attractive.
l'm fucking attracted to her.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.515
Okay. What-- what are we talking about?

40:34.682 --> 40:36.225
( Julie sighs )

40:40.021 --> 40:41.939
Just don't embarrass me.

40:50.949 --> 40:52.950
( soft chittering )

40:56.204 --> 40:57.871
- ( snaps )
- ( beeps )

40:58.039 --> 41:02.084
- ( echoing )
- Martine: lt just sounds really canned.

41:02.252 --> 41:04.962
- Canned?
- Yeah, like flat.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.256
- ( button clicks )
- Ear fatigue.

41:07.423 --> 41:10.092
lt's an actual phenomenon.
Afflicts many.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.386
l think your ears are tired.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.640
l think it's the echo.
Can we just take it out?

41:16.808 --> 41:18.475
l think we need a break.

41:21.729 --> 41:24.273
l think we need
to finish this scene.

41:24.440 --> 41:27.609
Honestly, l think if we come back to it
with fresh ears, it'll be better.

41:27.777 --> 41:30.988
Peter, we really need to,
like, get through this.

41:35.618 --> 41:37.536
Come on.

41:39.372 --> 41:41.123
Okay.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.501
- ( exhales )
- ( button clicks )

41:44.669 --> 41:47.421
( rustling, chittering )

41:47.589 --> 41:49.798
- ( button clicks )
- ( playback stops )

41:50.842 --> 41:53.677
- Listen, about, um...
- Yeah.

41:53.845 --> 41:55.971
...the other day
in the pool house--

41:56.139 --> 41:57.848
Look, l'm really sorry.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.808
- l--
- No no, l, um--

41:59.976 --> 42:02.352
l find you incredibly charming

42:02.520 --> 42:06.231
and intelligent and beautiful.

42:08.818 --> 42:10.861
l respect what you do.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.947
lt makes me excited
about what l do.

42:18.703 --> 42:21.496
And l think l just got, uh--

42:21.664 --> 42:25.459
just carried away
in that mix of, uh, feelings.

42:25.627 --> 42:28.754
Peter, it doesn't have to be a big deal.

42:28.922 --> 42:32.466
We can just pretend
it never happened and--

42:32.634 --> 42:35.677
Marriage is complicated.

42:41.559 --> 42:45.395
l think we should just
keep working on this right now.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.606
Yeah.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.735
Yeah, you're right.
( chuckles )

42:51.903 --> 42:53.695
- ( clears throat )
- ( button clicks )

42:53.863 --> 42:54.988
( rustling )

42:55.156 --> 42:57.407
- ( rustling stops )
- ( scoffs )

42:57.575 --> 42:59.618
l'm sorry.
Your physical presence

42:59.786 --> 43:01.536
this close to me is actually painful.

43:01.704 --> 43:03.664
( both chuckle )

43:24.269 --> 43:26.895
This house is, like, full of people.

43:27.063 --> 43:30.357
Don't worry about it.
This room is completely soundproofed.

43:35.405 --> 43:37.990
( Martine moaning )

44:02.807 --> 44:04.891
( birds chirping )

44:18.656 --> 44:20.866
Vroom!

44:22.910 --> 44:24.036
( Martine moaning )

44:24.203 --> 44:26.913
- ( thumping )
- ( both moaning )

44:35.798 --> 44:39.176
( water spraying )

44:41.554 --> 44:44.014
( tutor speaking ltalian )

44:44.182 --> 44:46.683
- "Panino"?
- Mmm.

44:57.528 --> 44:59.446
l don't know how to say it.

44:59.614 --> 45:00.947
( tutor sighs )

45:04.535 --> 45:05.702
Hmm.

45:20.218 --> 45:22.177
lt's called a slip.

45:28.434 --> 45:30.435
( crickets chirping )

46:13.646 --> 46:15.939
- Peter: Are you ready for bed?
- Julie: Where's my cookie?

46:16.107 --> 46:18.608
- ( Peter chuckles ) What cookie?
- You ate the last cookie?

46:18.776 --> 46:21.236
- Peter: No, there are no cookies left.
- ( both chuckle )

46:21.404 --> 46:22.863
- Julie: You suck.
- Are you coming to bed

46:23.030 --> 46:24.197
or are you gonna keep reading?

46:24.365 --> 46:26.616
- Julie: l'm gonna keep reading.
- All right.

46:29.287 --> 46:31.705
My breath just happens
to smell like chocolate...

46:31.873 --> 46:33.707
chip cookies.

47:00.401 --> 47:02.486
- Mmm.
- Oh, have more.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.828
Do you like Avi?

47:13.414 --> 47:14.581
Well, yeah.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.625
l do.

47:16.792 --> 47:18.752
l think he's really sweet.

47:20.838 --> 47:22.964
Do you like Avi?

47:23.132 --> 47:25.050
l don't know.

47:25.218 --> 47:27.010
l mean, he's certainly not like

47:27.178 --> 47:30.430
- my fantasy boyfriend or anything.
- Yeah.

47:30.598 --> 47:32.265
Wow. Your dad

47:32.433 --> 47:34.351
seemed like

47:34.519 --> 47:37.354
the fantasy boyfriend.

47:37.522 --> 47:39.105
But he wasn't.

47:41.025 --> 47:43.193
No, he wasn't.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.364
So then

47:47.532 --> 47:50.075
how do you know when
you've found the right guy?

47:52.537 --> 47:54.120
l don't know that you do know.

47:54.288 --> 47:56.540
l think you're just--

47:56.707 --> 47:58.708
you're ready...

48:00.044 --> 48:02.170
and you pick one.

48:03.714 --> 48:07.175
That's really depressing, Mom.

48:07.343 --> 48:10.428
No, l don't think it's depressing. l-l--

48:10.596 --> 48:12.639
l think--

48:12.807 --> 48:15.892
l think people change and, uh...

48:17.228 --> 48:18.770
and you keep changing

48:18.938 --> 48:22.148
and you make a decision

48:22.316 --> 48:24.568
to change together or...

48:25.570 --> 48:27.696
you split up.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.661
Um...

48:39.584 --> 48:41.751
see you in the morning.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.920
- Good night.
- Sleep well.

48:51.012 --> 48:52.762
( sighs )

49:26.464 --> 49:28.048
Hi.

49:30.259 --> 49:32.260
Hey, what are you doing here?

49:33.638 --> 49:35.847
Can l swim with you?

49:37.099 --> 49:40.310
l think you need to have
a grown-up as a lifeguard.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.650
You're a grown-up.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.361
Um, well, that's a good point.

49:49.528 --> 49:52.030
l'm just-- l'm not very--

49:52.198 --> 49:54.949
anyway, let's get you
back to bed, okay?

49:55.117 --> 49:57.160
l won't splash anymore.
l promise.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.788
Can you take me back to my room?

50:00.831 --> 50:03.500
- Um--
- lt's dark.

50:04.627 --> 50:07.712
l-- l don't want to wake
your parents up.

50:07.880 --> 50:10.090
We can walk on tippy-toes.

50:11.175 --> 50:12.509
Okay.

50:30.653 --> 50:33.697
Man.
These stickers--

50:33.864 --> 50:37.158
l had stickers like that
when l was your age,

50:37.326 --> 50:41.663
except l also had
birds and bees and stuff.

50:41.831 --> 50:45.959
They only had outer space stuff
at the Creativity Store.

50:47.712 --> 50:50.004
Well, it's looking good in here.

50:53.759 --> 50:55.260
Mmm.

50:58.806 --> 51:00.390
Okay.

51:02.727 --> 51:04.894
Okay.
Good night.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.899
( synthesizer notes echoing )

51:18.576 --> 51:20.618
So we can listen
to what he's doing on the synth

51:20.786 --> 51:22.829
with the ambient sounds
already in if you want.

51:22.997 --> 51:24.914
Yeah, that would be super helpful.

51:27.585 --> 51:29.627
( note warbling )

51:34.383 --> 51:36.134
lt seems like he wants
to play on the synth
