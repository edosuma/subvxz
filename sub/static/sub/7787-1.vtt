03:35.878 --> 03:39.089
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have begun our descent into Moscow.

03:39.089 --> 03:41.883
Please turn off
all portable electronic devices.

03:42.259 --> 03:43.593
Thank you.

03:43.844 --> 03:45.970
Sir, could you please turn that off?

03:46.389 --> 03:48.723
It can interfere
with the plane's navigation system.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.975
Do you really believe that?

03:50.975 --> 03:53.144
Because people have been talking

03:53.144 --> 03:55.605
outside the flight attendant
social circle of trust,

03:56.107 --> 04:00.068
and word is that nobody really believes that.

04:00.319 --> 04:03.238
Excuse my friend.
He was dropped on his head as a child.

04:03.447 --> 04:04.656
No. If these were really that bad,

04:04.656 --> 04:06.366
they wouldn't let you bring them
on the plane, flat out.

04:06.909 --> 04:09.619
If you agree with me,
don't unfold your arms.

04:12.790 --> 04:13.790
See?

04:14.417 --> 04:17.377
Dude, do you really need an extra minute
of playing Dora the Explorer?

04:17.377 --> 04:19.212
She was about to save the Crystal Kingdom.

04:21.923 --> 04:23.216
What the hell?

04:38.065 --> 04:40.692
We just experienced
an electrical short.

04:40.692 --> 04:42.902
To your right,
you will see heavy electrical activity

04:42.902 --> 04:44.571
in the upper stratosphere.

04:44.571 --> 04:46.364
Nothing of major concern.

04:48.159 --> 04:49.659
I hate flying.

04:56.751 --> 04:59.836
Due to electrical storms,
all outbound flights are canceled.

05:05.176 --> 05:07.802
When was the last time you wore that?

05:07.802 --> 05:10.346
I don't know. Graduation?

05:10.346 --> 05:12.140
You didn't go to graduation.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.018
But I still dressed up out of solidarity.

05:16.979 --> 05:18.313
All right, give me a Sharpie.

05:20.357 --> 05:23.777
One of these days,
I am not going to have a Sharpie in my bag.

05:23.777 --> 05:25.862
- Another poignant metaphor for me?
- Yes.

05:50.930 --> 05:53.723
It's an exclusive social network
for globetrotting travelers.

05:53.723 --> 05:56.810
It's a GPS-based navigation system
that allows young people

05:56.810 --> 06:00.063
to find the hottest bars and clubs
in cities around the world.

06:02.233 --> 06:04.234
Our expansion plans for Moscow...

06:04.902 --> 06:05.985
Sean?

06:06.403 --> 06:07.612
Jump in whenever.

06:07.612 --> 06:12.283
Our expansion plans for Moscow
include getting drunk, laid

06:12.283 --> 06:15.954
and ending up in a Russian prison,
all at the click of a button.

06:15.954 --> 06:18.540
Is it just me,
or does Cyrillic look like Klingon?

06:18.749 --> 06:20.124
Dude, get serious for a second.

06:20.417 --> 06:22.377
Come on, man.
I found that freaky Zvezda joint

06:22.377 --> 06:24.003
we're going to hit up for our victory lap.

06:24.296 --> 06:28.007
"Supermodels desperately seeking
software designers."

06:28.007 --> 06:29.926
That's a good idea.

06:29.926 --> 06:31.177
And when the Russians go for this,

06:31.177 --> 06:33.346
we're a $10-million company overnight.

06:38.477 --> 06:40.770
Fifty-six travelers
currently logged into Moscow.

06:41.438 --> 06:42.605
Ooh, an American.

06:42.605 --> 06:45.525
I didn't fly halfway around the world
to see Americans.

06:45.525 --> 06:46.609
Tell her to go to Applebee's.

06:46.609 --> 06:48.611
Zvezda? Zvezda.

06:49.113 --> 06:51.072
- Ben?
- Yeah?

06:51.282 --> 06:52.574
Have I ever let you down?

06:52.992 --> 06:56.242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:01.166 --> 07:03.626
We will let Skyler make the introductions.

07:05.337 --> 07:07.005
Wait for us?

07:10.426 --> 07:11.426
You ready?

07:12.303 --> 07:14.679
Teamwork makes the dream work.

07:14.679 --> 07:15.763
That's ridiculous.

07:27.902 --> 07:30.612
Whoa, guys.
What are you doing here?

07:32.239 --> 07:33.698
Didn't you get my e-mail?

07:35.367 --> 07:36.618
We won't be needing you.

07:37.912 --> 07:41.998
Hang on. My boy just spent, like,
12 grand to develop this.

07:41.998 --> 07:43.124
Plus, flights.

07:43.334 --> 07:45.752
Yeah, what the hell is going on here?
Looks exactly like my idea.

07:46.003 --> 07:50.048
Yeah, I know. It's very good.
It's almost perfect, thank you.

07:50.048 --> 07:51.674
Next time, you send an NDA.

07:53.135 --> 07:55.637
You must mean
the Non-Douchebag Agreement.

07:58.349 --> 07:59.641
Call security. Whoa, whoa.

07:59.641 --> 08:01.351
Skyler, why are you doing this?

08:02.353 --> 08:03.394
It's business.

08:04.146 --> 08:05.313
It's criminal.

08:07.232 --> 08:08.316
Welcome to Moscow.

08:10.152 --> 08:12.195
Security will help see you out.

08:22.581 --> 08:25.625
This is such bullshit.

08:25.625 --> 08:26.625
Wow.

08:29.463 --> 08:31.339
- Look at this place.
- I know, right?

08:31.339 --> 08:32.423
It's amazing.

08:32.423 --> 08:33.799
Amazing, but are we lost?

08:33.799 --> 08:36.135
No. This map says
we're only two blocks away.

08:36.135 --> 08:37.595
All right. Hold up, hold up.

08:38.554 --> 08:40.472
- Everyone say, "Moscow."
- Moscow.

08:40.472 --> 08:41.640
Whee.

08:42.726 --> 08:45.436
- So how did we find this place?
- This guy's blog.

08:45.980 --> 08:47.313
- Cute?
- Yeah,

08:47.313 --> 08:49.899
I mean, if he's the one on the left.

08:49.899 --> 08:52.527
Nat, his friend is wearing a Snuggie
with a bolo tie.

08:52.527 --> 08:53.903
I know you're into that, don't lie.

08:53.903 --> 08:56.990
Yeah, if I end up some human lampshade
in this guy's creepy basement...

08:56.990 --> 08:59.450
Relax. I am giving you
a no-lampshade guarantee.

08:59.743 --> 09:00.702
Shall we?

09:00.702 --> 09:03.246
We shall have a drink.

09:03.914 --> 09:06.499
I am like, "We have to go up there, right?"

09:15.844 --> 09:19.804
# I like that, I like the Gucci, Gucci #
# I like the dollar bill #

09:19.804 --> 09:23.391
# I love your pocket rocket #
# We live to shock it, shock it #

09:23.391 --> 09:27.228
# I like the way you smile #
# I might just bite your lip #

09:27.228 --> 09:31.065
# I see you talking, talking #
# Your hands are talking, talking #

09:33.402 --> 09:35.403
# I like that #

09:38.282 --> 09:42.243
# I like your dirty mind #
# Mine's on it all the time #

09:42.243 --> 09:45.955
# Oh, let me shake it, shake it #
# Oh, Polaroid it, shake it #

09:45.955 --> 09:47.623
# I am a graffiti girl #

09:47.623 --> 09:50.334
Screw it.
Big picture, this doesn't mean shit.

09:50.334 --> 09:51.627
It does mean shit.

09:51.879 --> 09:54.130
Our future is exactly shit right now.

09:54.130 --> 09:55.840
Okay. We will sue those guys.

09:56.383 --> 10:00.011
Get a huge international Matlock-ass
lawyer who knows Russian law.

10:00.262 --> 10:01.471
What Russian law?

10:01.471 --> 10:04.140
Just don't sweat it, all right?
We will figure something out.

10:05.309 --> 10:08.061
- How can you be like that?
- Like what?

10:08.061 --> 10:11.397
Like delusionally optimistic all the time.

10:12.483 --> 10:15.234
I am just more used to screwing up
than you are.

10:18.989 --> 10:21.157
I try and get mad at you...

10:36.673 --> 10:39.050
Son, peep the kiosk.

10:40.219 --> 10:41.511
Full on kiosk.

10:41.887 --> 10:43.387
Kiosk her to marry me.

10:47.810 --> 10:49.018
Seriously?

10:49.436 --> 10:50.686
That Swedish prick.

10:56.110 --> 10:57.610
Guys, you're here.

10:57.610 --> 11:00.363
It's impressive. That's good research.

11:00.864 --> 11:03.449
Look. You can't be so naive, okay?

11:03.449 --> 11:04.742
I mean, you come out here,

11:04.742 --> 11:07.620
everybody out here is like hungry wolves,
and you act like two little lambs?

11:07.620 --> 11:08.830
Of course you're going to get eaten.

11:09.873 --> 11:13.835
You may like to think of yourself as a wolf
so you can sleep at night,

11:13.835 --> 11:16.546
but the truth is,
you're just a straight-up thief.

11:16.546 --> 11:18.172
You have to understand,
this is just business.

11:18.549 --> 11:19.757
Some people can take it.

11:20.217 --> 11:21.217
Some people can't.

11:21.426 --> 11:22.426
It's a nice shirt.

11:22.426 --> 11:24.804
Oh, thanks. Your mom left it in my room.

11:28.058 --> 11:32.019
No human society exists
without booze or religion.

11:32.563 --> 11:35.231
That's why I drink religiously.

11:39.736 --> 11:40.736
Dude, the American.

11:42.739 --> 11:43.865
Oh, really?

11:45.617 --> 11:47.493
"Stuck in Moscow. Please help."

11:47.493 --> 11:49.078
Applebee's, never mind.

11:49.413 --> 11:50.872
We should help.

11:51.748 --> 11:53.666
Nyet. Nyet.

11:54.293 --> 11:55.668
- Lesbian.
- Yeah.

11:55.668 --> 11:56.752
Herpes.

11:56.752 --> 11:57.962
Muchas gracias.

11:59.173 --> 12:00.298
Thank you, gentlemen.

12:00.298 --> 12:02.341
Good job. Thank you.

12:04.595 --> 12:07.555
Snuggie, six o'clock.
I told you his friend is hot.

12:07.555 --> 12:09.599
You and your valedictorians.

12:09.599 --> 12:11.184
"Stuck in Moscow. Please help"?

12:11.518 --> 12:12.894
Theglobetrot.com.

12:13.270 --> 12:15.146
Now officially retired.

12:15.522 --> 12:18.149
What happened? Are you guys
some kind of millionaires or something?

12:18.358 --> 12:20.276
No, no. Try billionaire.

12:21.403 --> 12:26.157
Uh... Or just the loyal friend
of a full-of-shit wingman?

12:26.157 --> 12:27.950
- I am Ben.
- Full-of-shit wingman.

12:28.785 --> 12:30.536
Anne. This is Natalie.

12:30.536 --> 12:34.707
Well, thanks for the tip.
It's definitely living up to expectations.

12:34.707 --> 12:36.459
Sean is actually the man
who finds this stuff.

12:36.459 --> 12:37.543
And what do you do?

12:38.295 --> 12:39.295
Everything else.

12:41.798 --> 12:44.217
Can I get a lager? A beer?

12:44.509 --> 12:46.427
Does anyone speak Russian?

12:46.427 --> 12:48.721
Only what he learned in Rocky IV.

12:54.770 --> 12:58.147
So, anyway, I am on my way to Nepal.
Shooting photos.

12:58.147 --> 12:59.649
I am trying to get them into this gallery.

12:59.649 --> 13:00.983
You will get in.

13:00.983 --> 13:04.028
Nat, here, is my faithful assistant
and my best girl.

13:05.155 --> 13:08.491
Well, I did have other plans this summer,
but they fell through,

13:08.491 --> 13:11.744
so I quit my job and I left my mom a note.
And here I am.

13:11.744 --> 13:12.828
Why would you do that?

13:13.497 --> 13:14.497
A dumbass boy.

13:14.598 --> 13:16.499
- Ooh.
- Okay, can we not talk about that?

13:16.833 --> 13:18.251
Sorry.

13:18.251 --> 13:19.961
So, what do you actually do?

13:20.212 --> 13:21.504
Yeah, what do you do?

13:22.130 --> 13:23.339
Uh...

13:24.800 --> 13:26.634
He likes basking in the possibility.

13:26.634 --> 13:27.718
Right?

13:27.718 --> 13:29.595
Or just never having to commit to anything.

13:30.639 --> 13:31.847
You're kind of a dick.

13:31.847 --> 13:32.932
Photo time.

13:33.183 --> 13:36.936
No dumbass faces, no peace signs.
Come on, now.

13:36.936 --> 13:39.189
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

13:39.189 --> 13:41.774
One, two, three.

13:41.774 --> 13:43.401
What?

13:45.487 --> 13:46.445
Sorry, guys, my bad.

13:46.445 --> 13:47.822
What did you do now, Sean?

13:47.822 --> 13:49.115
Russia.

13:52.828 --> 13:54.453
What's happening?

13:57.082 --> 13:58.541
What is that?

14:00.294 --> 14:02.003
Northern Lights, maybe?

14:02.003 --> 14:04.213
I have never seen this before.

14:09.511 --> 14:11.095
What the hell?

14:15.726 --> 14:16.934
Wow.

14:17.227 --> 14:18.311
My phone is dead.

14:18.311 --> 14:20.396
The whole block is dark.

14:23.025 --> 14:25.735
- My God.
- They're beautiful.

14:25.735 --> 14:27.111
This isn't normal, bud.

14:27.988 --> 14:29.572
Holy shit.

14:37.497 --> 14:38.497
Nat.

14:39.291 --> 14:40.791
Look at that.

14:40.791 --> 14:42.585
Sean, you see that?

14:52.095 --> 14:53.095
Whoa.

15:33.929 --> 15:34.929
What's he doing?

15:49.786 --> 15:51.986
Oh, my God.

15:54.116 --> 15:57.116
- Run.
- Run.

16:13.176 --> 16:14.552
- Go.
- Run. Run. Run. Run.

16:14.552 --> 16:16.387
Natalie. Come on.

16:29.192 --> 16:30.192
Stay together.

16:30.192 --> 16:31.402
Lock it.

16:49.379 --> 16:50.463
Run.

17:11.734 --> 17:12.902
Move.

17:14.069 --> 17:15.779
Come on. Come on.

17:22.871 --> 17:24.371
Oh, my God.

17:31.671 --> 17:33.047
- Fuck.
- Oh, my God.

17:33.924 --> 17:35.341
Come on. Come on. Come on.

17:43.808 --> 17:45.684
- This way.
- Go, go, go, go.

17:47.145 --> 17:48.145
Go.

17:50.732 --> 17:53.025
Holy shit. Come on.

17:57.572 --> 17:59.365
This way. Come on.

18:01.409 --> 18:02.493
Come on, come on.

18:06.081 --> 18:07.498
Ben. Let's go.

18:09.736 --> 18:13.045
Sean. Get in there. Go, go, go.

18:13.045 --> 18:15.130
- Come on. This way.
- Annie.

18:18.969 --> 18:19.969
Sean.

18:20.637 --> 18:21.637
Come on.

18:30.981 --> 18:32.565
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

18:33.775 --> 18:34.858
Ben?

18:34.858 --> 18:36.819
Natalie. Natalie.

18:38.113 --> 18:39.863
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. I don't know.

18:39.863 --> 18:41.740
- What are we going to do?
- He's dead.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.409
It's okay. It's okay.

18:45.328 --> 18:46.579
Oh, shit.

18:47.455 --> 18:49.999
No. No. No. No.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.375
Don't open the door.

18:54.170 --> 18:55.212
Oh, God.

18:59.884 --> 19:01.594
What do they want?
They're killing everyone.

19:01.594 --> 19:02.803
They're shredding people.

19:02.803 --> 19:04.346
- Did you see that?
- No.

19:04.598 --> 19:06.849
Quiet, quiet, quiet. Holy shit.

19:09.144 --> 19:10.811
What is it? Where did it come from?

19:10.811 --> 19:12.313
Annie, what's going on?

19:12.313 --> 19:13.939
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:16.192 --> 19:17.276
What the...

19:17.276 --> 19:18.444
No, no.

19:18.444 --> 19:20.738
It isn't safe up there. I saw it.

19:20.738 --> 19:22.031
What the hell are those things?

19:22.031 --> 19:23.616
It's like they're invisible.
We can't see them.

19:23.616 --> 19:24.742
What's happening?

19:24.742 --> 19:26.535
There's nowhere to go,
they're everywhere.

19:26.535 --> 19:28.287
Everybody, be quiet.

19:39.591 --> 19:40.551
Saturday

19:52.020 --> 19:52.740
Sunday

20:00.570 --> 20:03.072
Do you really think
that you're the only person down here?

20:03.072 --> 20:04.156
Monday

20:04.156 --> 20:05.783
Come on. Oh, come on.

20:05.783 --> 20:10.496
I am sick and tired of your bullshit, man.
I am sick and tired...

20:14.334 --> 20:15.174
Tuesday

20:22.342 --> 20:23.425
This is it.

20:23.927 --> 20:25.260
Bon appetit.

20:33.978 --> 20:35.854
Yeah, like, the thousandth time is a charm?

20:39.693 --> 20:40.943
How long since we have heard them?

20:41.361 --> 20:44.071
I said 27 hours. Give or take an hour.

20:46.616 --> 20:50.619
Unless you want to stay down here
pissing in tin cans forever...

20:51.538 --> 20:52.913
Screw that.

20:58.128 --> 20:59.545
It's time to go.

20:59.545 --> 21:02.464
We're going to head to the U.S. Embassy.

21:25.488 --> 21:26.864
Come on.

21:26.864 --> 21:28.449
Careful, now.

21:35.498 --> 21:37.583
Ben. Look at this.

21:38.042 --> 21:39.376
They killed everyone.

21:39.376 --> 21:41.044
It was a massacre.

21:44.424 --> 21:46.842
We should go to the Swedish Embassy,
it's closer. We should really go...

21:46.842 --> 21:48.051
Annie.

21:48.051 --> 21:50.262
See if they have
any water, food, supplies.

21:51.639 --> 21:52.848
Here, take these waters.

21:52.848 --> 21:53.932
Grab that bag.

21:53.932 --> 21:55.601
Just take what you can.

21:55.601 --> 21:57.853
Take this. Go.

22:00.857 --> 22:02.232
Holy shit.

22:03.359 --> 22:04.860
Look at this place.

22:04.860 --> 22:07.029
Oh, my God.

22:07.029 --> 22:09.948
You think they're gone? Like "gone" gone?

22:13.536 --> 22:15.287
All the ash.

22:15.580 --> 22:17.623
Is it going to be like this
all over the city?

22:17.623 --> 22:18.707
We can't be the only ones.

22:22.378 --> 22:23.545
Do you even know where we're going?

22:23.797 --> 22:27.299
I just wish we had a plan
that didn't come from some takeout menu.

22:27.299 --> 22:29.384
Nobody's going to find us
hiding in the storeroom.

22:29.384 --> 22:33.055
Stay here, or find your embassy.
Nobody's stopping you.

22:33.556 --> 22:34.556
Jesus.

22:34.891 --> 22:35.974
Let's go.

22:35.974 --> 22:37.559
Come on, Annie.

22:40.396 --> 22:41.396
It's a big city.

22:41.731 --> 22:44.358
There has to be more people out there.

23:21.855 --> 23:24.106
Slow down. Slow down.

23:24.106 --> 23:25.691
Oh, man.

23:25.691 --> 23:26.775
- Shit. You okay?
- You okay?

23:26.775 --> 23:28.819
Just wait, guys.

23:28.819 --> 23:29.862
- Okay. I am okay.
- Wait.

23:29.862 --> 23:31.530
Come on, we got to keep going.

23:31.530 --> 23:33.490
- Come on. Let's keep going.
- Natalie.

23:33.490 --> 23:35.367
- Let's go.
- Come on.

23:39.205 --> 23:40.914
Come on, hurry up.

23:49.966 --> 23:52.467
Wait, wait, wait. This way, come on.

23:53.595 --> 23:54.553
Come on, down here.

23:54.553 --> 23:56.513
Is this the right way?

23:57.390 --> 23:58.599
Quiet.

24:02.854 --> 24:04.688
Hang on a second.

24:04.688 --> 24:08.066
Wait, you hear that? Come on, this way.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.569
What's there?

24:10.569 --> 24:11.862
Wait.

24:15.867 --> 24:17.409
Come on.

24:17.409 --> 24:19.411
Hey. Hey, lady?

24:19.411 --> 24:20.495
Go away.

24:20.495 --> 24:22.164
You will bring ghosts with you.

24:22.164 --> 24:23.248
Go away.

24:23.750 --> 24:24.750
Novinskiy Street?

24:24.750 --> 24:26.877
Everyone in the city is dead.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.087
They will kill you.

24:29.297 --> 24:30.339
What?

24:30.673 --> 24:31.673
That way.

24:32.592 --> 24:34.676
- Ben, keep moving. Let's go.
- Thank you so much.

24:34.676 --> 24:36.678
Beware of the lights.

24:37.180 --> 24:39.097
- What did she say?
- We're all going to die.

24:39.097 --> 24:40.474
Oh, my God.

24:41.434 --> 24:44.019
We don't know where they are.

24:44.019 --> 24:45.187
It's okay.

24:45.187 --> 24:47.230
Ben. This way, right?

24:52.654 --> 24:53.820
Are we lost?

24:54.739 --> 24:56.573
- God damn it, we're lost already.
- We're not lost.

24:56.573 --> 24:58.575
Do you know where you're going?

24:58.575 --> 25:00.953
Dude, are we lost?

25:00.953 --> 25:03.705
No, I think once we cross the bridge...

25:10.421 --> 25:11.713
Oh, shit.

25:25.228 --> 25:27.938
This crew doesn't inspire confidence.
We don't know anything about them.

25:27.938 --> 25:29.231
It's the best we have got right now.

25:29.231 --> 25:31.400
There's another bridge right over there.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.112
What's important is that
you and I stick together, okay?

25:35.112 --> 25:36.321
He's right.

25:36.781 --> 25:37.781
Guys, come on.

25:37.781 --> 25:40.033
It's back this way. Come on.

25:54.799 --> 25:56.591
Stop, stop, stop.

26:00.680 --> 26:03.390
- That cop car will have a better map.
- Yeah, yeah.

26:03.390 --> 26:04.850
You guys wait over there. Let's go.

26:04.850 --> 26:06.393
- All right.
- Okay, go.

26:37.967 --> 26:38.967
What?

26:41.304 --> 26:42.304
Come on. Hurry up.

26:42.597 --> 26:43.680
Did you see that?

26:43.890 --> 26:46.475
Give me that. You're taking too long.

26:46.893 --> 26:48.643
We don't know these things can see or hear.

26:48.643 --> 26:49.811
We know they kill.

26:54.442 --> 26:55.776
- Road flares.
- Here we go.

26:55.776 --> 26:57.360
It's all in Russian.

26:57.360 --> 26:58.695
What did you expect?

26:58.946 --> 27:00.906
We will count off blocks from landmarks.

27:25.348 --> 27:27.641
No. Wait. Get down. Get down.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.561
Get inside.

27:32.188 --> 27:33.396
Go, go, go.

27:50.414 --> 27:52.874
Where did it go? Can you see it?

27:54.919 --> 27:56.128
Can you see anything?

27:59.549 --> 28:00.632
Shit.

28:24.240 --> 28:25.490
- What are you doing?
- Something.

28:53.436 --> 28:54.811
Is it gone?

28:54.811 --> 28:55.979
I think so.

29:17.251 --> 29:18.210
Holy shit.

29:18.210 --> 29:20.253
That was way too close.

29:24.759 --> 29:25.759
Sean.

29:27.762 --> 29:28.845
Hey, you waited.

29:28.845 --> 29:31.473
Yeah, yeah. That's the plan, right?
Stick together?

29:31.473 --> 29:33.391
Good. Thanks.

29:33.391 --> 29:34.517
Did you see that dog?

29:34.517 --> 29:37.270
It killed the dog. It killed the dog.

29:38.481 --> 29:40.190
Wait. Wait. Wait.

29:44.237 --> 29:45.612
It's the wind. Stop freaking out.

29:45.905 --> 29:47.656
What, me?
I am the only one freaking out here?

29:47.865 --> 29:50.075
This wasn't how I thought
my week would go either, all right?

29:50.075 --> 29:51.952
I am just trying to keep my freak-out
on the inside.

29:52.245 --> 29:54.329
Let's cut through this way.

30:00.586 --> 30:01.586
Shit.

30:01.837 --> 30:03.213
Oh, my God.

30:28.781 --> 30:30.782
Skyler. Come on.

30:30.782 --> 30:34.536
The faster we get to the embassy,
the faster we get home.

30:36.622 --> 30:37.831
"Home"?

30:39.250 --> 30:40.500
You think there's "home"?

30:42.712 --> 30:44.254
Everybody back home is dead.

30:44.254 --> 30:46.631
- You don't know that.
- Of course they are.

30:47.133 --> 30:48.466
All our friends, our families.

30:48.466 --> 30:49.634
Say it's like this everywhere,

30:49.634 --> 30:52.929
the five of us, we're here,
we're in Moscow, and we're alive.

30:53.472 --> 30:56.266
Okay? I doubt we're the five luckiest people
on the planet.

30:56.517 --> 30:59.894
Which makes for millions of survivors,
in other cities, all over the world.

31:00.563 --> 31:03.648
It doesn't even matter anymore.
Don't you understand?

31:03.648 --> 31:06.943
I mean, we take one step outside
and we're dust.

31:08.112 --> 31:09.654
We can't even see these things.

31:10.906 --> 31:13.450
The way it lit up that cop car.

31:13.450 --> 31:15.327
Electricity gives it away.

31:16.329 --> 31:18.413
Street lights, headlights...

31:18.413 --> 31:20.123
You're right.

31:20.123 --> 31:21.666
Daytime is more dangerous than night.

31:21.666 --> 31:24.252
We should go outside when it's dark.

31:34.430 --> 31:36.264
- Warning devices.
- Good idea.

31:36.849 --> 31:38.850
Not as dumb as I thought.

31:53.282 --> 31:55.283
Looks like
the embassy is about a mile away.

31:56.619 --> 31:59.371
Are you going to get it right this time?

32:00.790 --> 32:02.457
Are you going to be less of an asshole?

32:04.377 --> 32:07.337
I just want us to make smart choices.

32:08.464 --> 32:10.131
Is that what you call
what happened at the club?

32:10.758 --> 32:12.926
- Making a smart choice?
- Annie, don't.

32:17.223 --> 32:19.849
I think we all want to be

32:22.144 --> 32:24.062
brave in our own minds.

32:25.689 --> 32:28.817
But the truth is that
you don't know who you are

32:30.820 --> 32:33.029
until something happens.

32:33.029 --> 32:35.156
And then you just react.

32:38.077 --> 32:39.577
And I just...

32:39.577 --> 32:43.832
I see these two seconds just playing
over and over and over again.

32:53.884 --> 32:55.176
We need better clothes.

32:57.346 --> 32:58.596
I got it.

33:00.015 --> 33:02.142
What's the dress code
for the end of the world?

33:02.142 --> 33:03.226
Jacket, no tie?

33:05.396 --> 33:07.021
I will come, too.

33:39.763 --> 33:41.389
Hey, there.

33:43.851 --> 33:47.020
Sorry, buddy. I am going to have to take this.

35:13.524 --> 35:14.524
Sean.

35:18.571 --> 35:19.737
Hey, wait. No.

35:19.737 --> 35:20.989
- Are you crazy?
- Don't move.

35:42.678 --> 35:44.178
It's okay. Come on.

35:44.972 --> 35:45.972
They're inside.

35:48.517 --> 35:51.019
- We were so close, why didn't it see us?
- The glass.

35:51.270 --> 35:53.187
- It didn't see you?
- No.

35:53.187 --> 35:55.690
I bet they sense
our bio-electromagnetic shit.

35:55.899 --> 35:56.941
That almost makes sense.

35:56.941 --> 35:58.026
How did you come up with that?

35:58.319 --> 35:59.652
I don't know. Shark Week.

36:00.029 --> 36:02.447
My money's on they see our electric pulses.

36:02.447 --> 36:03.990
And the glass blinded it.

36:03.990 --> 36:05.199
It's an electrical insulator.

36:05.199 --> 36:06.618
You're willing to bet your life
on that theory?

36:07.202 --> 36:08.620
We just did.

36:09.705 --> 36:11.289
Come on.

36:11.289 --> 36:12.874
Come on, come on. Let's go.

36:14.084 --> 36:15.376
This way.

36:36.440 --> 36:37.565
Oh, shit.

36:39.068 --> 36:40.902
What did you expect?

36:42.571 --> 36:44.197
What do we do now?

36:44.197 --> 36:45.990
Where do we go?

36:49.536 --> 36:50.745
Come on.

36:51.955 --> 36:53.956
What are you... What do you...

37:30.994 --> 37:32.120
What are you going to do with that?

37:33.122 --> 37:35.456
I don't know. Feels good.

37:36.083 --> 37:37.375
You know how to use that thing?

37:38.085 --> 37:39.085
Yeah.

37:44.800 --> 37:46.467
- Stop.
- Skyler.

37:47.428 --> 37:48.511
Stop.

37:58.522 --> 38:00.940
All right. I have seen enough.
Let's just get the hell out of here.

38:00.940 --> 38:02.400
And go where?

38:03.360 --> 38:04.360
Up.

38:04.820 --> 38:05.862
God damn it, Sean.

38:06.613 --> 38:08.448
We don't know what's up there.

38:08.448 --> 38:10.616
Or where we're going, for that matter.

38:10.616 --> 38:12.744
Listen, we need a better view.

38:12.744 --> 38:15.830
Somewhere where we can see
what's going on. What direction's safe.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.498
You guys want to get yourself killed?

38:18.167 --> 38:20.334
Skyler, we should stick together.

38:25.549 --> 38:26.716
Come on.

38:30.804 --> 38:33.139
- Nat, I...
- Come on.

38:36.894 --> 38:38.478
I got it down here.

39:09.426 --> 39:10.760
Hello?

39:24.024 --> 39:27.193
Budapest, 1230. Antwerp, 621.

39:27.193 --> 39:29.821
- Are these times?
- Maybe.

39:30.072 --> 39:31.072
Guys, look at this.

39:31.740 --> 39:34.575
Their electromagnetic bombardment
shorted our hardware.

39:34.575 --> 39:36.577
No missiles. No jets.

39:37.663 --> 39:39.747
This wasn't just Moscow.

39:41.583 --> 39:44.001
Communications stayed up
for three minutes.

39:44.001 --> 39:47.964
New York, London, Paris, Tokyo

39:47.964 --> 39:52.009
all reported invisible invaders.
Aggressive assault strategy.

39:53.512 --> 39:54.804
Skyler was right.

39:56.682 --> 39:57.849
There is no home.

39:57.849 --> 40:01.018
- Not like we remember it.
- Oh, God.

40:01.018 --> 40:04.063
Hardware from the underground
survived their initial attack.

40:04.439 --> 40:05.648
We salvaged what we could,

40:05.648 --> 40:08.943
hope to reconnect
with Antwerp, Budapest.

40:11.738 --> 40:13.656
These aren't times.

40:13.656 --> 40:15.241
These are numbers of survivors.

40:17.703 --> 40:21.330
We found an Emergency Action Message
from allies here in Moscow.

40:21.330 --> 40:25.459
Global HF frequency 4-7-0-9....

40:28.964 --> 40:30.298
What did the message say?

40:31.466 --> 40:32.884
That's it.

40:40.183 --> 40:41.976
Hey, check this out.

40:59.745 --> 41:00.912
Oh, my God.

41:01.663 --> 41:04.582
You said those things see electricity,
so turn it off.

41:04.582 --> 41:06.500
- The bulbs aren't on.
- Wait.

41:15.469 --> 41:16.469
What's he saying?

41:16.887 --> 41:19.722
- Please, Sean, just turn it off, okay?
- It's repeating.

41:20.474 --> 41:21.515
A message.

41:21.767 --> 41:22.850
Please turn it off.

41:23.727 --> 41:24.727
How is it working?

41:24.937 --> 41:27.980
God damn it, okay?
Those things can see it, so turn it off.

41:27.980 --> 41:29.065
Sean.

41:31.109 --> 41:32.318
Okay.

41:32.694 --> 41:34.195
- Jesus.
- It's okay.

41:35.447 --> 41:37.573
Come on. Let's find a view.

41:44.748 --> 41:47.291
Ben? Over here, check this out.

42:04.226 --> 42:05.685
Holy shit.

42:12.359 --> 42:13.985
We're surrounded.

42:15.070 --> 42:16.112
Dead center.

42:17.948 --> 42:19.657
What are they doing out there?

42:19.657 --> 42:21.575
It's like they're digging for something.

42:21.952 --> 42:23.911
They mess with everything electrical.

42:25.080 --> 42:28.207
They got to obey some sort of rules,
have some sort of purpose.

42:29.668 --> 42:31.919
They came here with a plan.

42:33.296 --> 42:34.296
What's ours?

42:34.715 --> 42:37.008
There's more survivors.

42:37.008 --> 42:38.634
We know they're out there,
we just have to find them.

42:46.101 --> 42:47.184
Who is it?

42:49.813 --> 42:50.813
Skyler.

42:52.274 --> 42:53.941
What the hell is he doing?

42:54.735 --> 42:57.486
Come on. We got to stop him.

42:59.781 --> 43:00.781
Wait, why?

43:01.366 --> 43:02.616
The guy understands some Russian.

43:02.909 --> 43:04.535
He can translate the message for us.

43:04.535 --> 43:05.619
Be careful.

43:05.619 --> 43:07.496
We will be right back.

43:26.433 --> 43:27.475
Oh, no.

43:28.977 --> 43:29.727
No.

43:32.817 --> 43:37.359
No, no, no, no, no.

43:38.153 --> 43:42.503
- Sean.
- Sean.

43:45.137 --> 43:48.662
- Sean.
- No.

43:49.247 --> 43:50.331
We have to warn them.

43:52.793 --> 43:53.793
Now.

43:56.671 --> 43:58.339
Skyler.

44:01.301 --> 44:02.426
Skyler.

44:02.677 --> 44:03.803
Get back here.

44:03.803 --> 44:06.472
Wait, wait, I think I saw something.

44:10.936 --> 44:12.603
Oh, shit. Skyler.

44:12.603 --> 44:14.647
Oh, shit.

44:17.192 --> 44:18.317
Ben.

44:19.528 --> 44:20.528
Oh, shit.

44:23.115 --> 44:25.115
- Look out.
- He's trapped.

44:30.163 --> 44:31.705
Get out of here.

44:36.920 --> 44:38.546
Run.

44:45.053 --> 44:46.345
Sean, come on.

44:46.345 --> 44:48.055
Come on. Right.

44:50.058 --> 44:51.058
No.

45:05.907 --> 45:07.575
Where's Skyler?

45:07.575 --> 45:10.452
He's dead, he's dead. He's dead.

45:12.330 --> 45:13.497
Oh, my God.

45:13.497 --> 45:14.999
Oh, my...

45:16.877 --> 45:17.877
I can't do this.

45:18.420 --> 45:20.671
- Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
- No, I can't do this.

45:20.671 --> 45:24.048
- You have to.
- All we're doing is buying time.

45:25.135 --> 45:26.552
Look at this.

45:27.012 --> 45:28.679
That's got to be what Skyler saw.

45:33.727 --> 45:34.935
There's someone in there.

45:35.604 --> 45:37.271
It's not that far.

45:38.857 --> 45:40.399
The sun is about to come up. No way.

45:41.359 --> 45:42.693
We can make it.

45:42.693 --> 45:45.070
Sean, what is wrong with you?

45:45.070 --> 45:47.865
After what just happened to Skyler?
That could happen to any one of us.

45:47.865 --> 45:52.411
Listen to me. That person is surviving,
right in the middle of all this.

45:55.916 --> 45:56.916
Whoever it is,

45:58.335 --> 46:00.127
odds are they're going to understand
this message.

46:08.261 --> 46:09.553
Let's go.

46:14.851 --> 46:16.268
I am not giving up.

46:16.895 --> 46:19.480
And if I am not giving up,
you're not giving up.

46:22.442 --> 46:23.859
What are we waiting for?

46:34.829 --> 46:37.289
- We're almost there, right?
- Yeah.

46:44.214 --> 46:46.340
Hurry, the sun's coming up.

46:47.968 --> 46:49.885
Come on. Through here.

47:15.745 --> 47:17.037
Who the hell are you?

47:17.706 --> 47:19.498
Do you want to die, assholes?

47:19.749 --> 47:21.375
We saw the light.

47:26.673 --> 47:29.216
Next time, knock.

47:31.803 --> 47:32.886
Are your parents here?

47:38.393 --> 47:39.810
I am sorry.

47:39.810 --> 47:41.061
It's okay.

47:41.855 --> 47:43.397
I am tough.

47:44.357 --> 47:46.734
Come this way. Come with me.

47:54.826 --> 47:56.577
Did you find one?

47:56.577 --> 47:57.661
Yes.

48:03.585 --> 48:05.419
Ah, good.

48:05.837 --> 48:07.254
Sergei?

48:13.011 --> 48:14.762
Quickly, we must close the cage.

48:34.282 --> 48:36.492
Welcome, make
yourself at home.

48:42.123 --> 48:43.499
You're young...

48:43.499 --> 48:46.585
...and young people make
rash decisions.

48:46.836 --> 48:48.670
It's why you and
Vika are still alive.

48:49.881 --> 48:53.050
We don't really understand much Russian.

48:53.050 --> 48:54.301
Sean.

49:05.772 --> 49:08.440
I turned on the light to attract survivors.

49:09.067 --> 49:11.985
First the girl, then you.

49:12.278 --> 49:13.278
I am Vika.

49:14.656 --> 49:16.073
That's DJ Lance Rock.

49:20.245 --> 49:21.537
Who is this guy?

49:21.537 --> 49:22.830
Mr. Sergei.

49:23.498 --> 49:25.207
I think he's an electrician.

49:26.126 --> 49:28.168
Or maybe a plumber.

49:28.670 --> 49:29.711
Well, what is this?

49:29.711 --> 49:32.172
Mr. Sergei calls it a Faraday cage.

49:32.172 --> 49:36.385
The steel bars
ground external electrical currents.

49:37.470 --> 49:39.930
The cage, it works.

49:41.433 --> 49:43.142
You mean it keeps them away?

49:43.518 --> 49:45.519
They can't smell us if we're inside.

49:45.519 --> 49:46.645
It's a shark cage, bro.

49:46.645 --> 49:49.690
Mr. Sergei thinks
they're made up of wave energy.

49:50.834 --> 49:54.987
They are made up of
lethal wave energy.

49:55.530 --> 49:57.364
That's why they're invisible to us.

49:59.409 --> 50:01.702
He says they microwaved Moscow.

50:02.454 --> 50:04.329
Burned everything out.

50:12.672 --> 50:13.881
Hey, guys, the message.

50:18.511 --> 50:20.554
Vika, you have got to listen to this.

50:20.763 --> 50:23.557
It's repeating a broadcast or something.

50:28.480 --> 50:30.105
Captain Nikolai Ivanov

50:30.648 --> 50:34.026
from the K-1-5-2 Nerpa....

50:34.819 --> 50:35.861
Oh, my God.

50:36.321 --> 50:37.488
The Russian Navy.

50:39.157 --> 50:40.908
A nuclear submarine

50:41.117 --> 50:42.659
in the Moskva River.

50:43.203 --> 50:45.245
They leave tomorrow morning at 6:00.

50:45.245 --> 50:49.791
Shielded nuclear power.
An undersea Faraday cage.

50:50.627 --> 50:52.211
Brilliant option.

50:53.046 --> 50:54.546
You mean it can get us out of here?

50:54.797 --> 50:56.381
We have to get on that sub.

50:57.050 --> 50:59.426
There are more, with survivors.

50:59.928 --> 51:03.514
One from the U.S., leaving Nova Scotia.

51:04.766 --> 51:07.434
A British submarine
waiting in the English Channel.

51:07.727 --> 51:08.936
We have to go when it's dark.

51:10.104 --> 51:13.607
Gives us five or six hours.
Is that enough time?

51:14.108 --> 51:18.111
It says they are in the north end of the river.

51:18.321 --> 51:19.863
It's deeper there.

51:20.448 --> 51:22.282
You think we can cross the city?

51:23.201 --> 51:24.451
Yeah.

51:35.797 --> 51:37.297
Can you help me gather supplies?

51:37.549 --> 51:38.799
Sure, kid.

51:39.300 --> 51:40.592
I am not a kid.

51:41.302 --> 51:42.302
Got it.

51:53.064 --> 51:54.147
Come.

51:54.899 --> 51:56.275
Let's go.

52:15.211 --> 52:16.420
We're fine.

52:16.420 --> 52:18.880
- You have done this a hundred times, right?
- Yeah.

52:19.382 --> 52:20.924
Just close the cage.

52:21.342 --> 52:22.843
Make sure it's locked.

52:49.829 --> 52:51.330
Hurry.

52:55.209 --> 52:56.293
What is this?

52:56.293 --> 52:58.337
It's homemade.

52:58.630 --> 53:00.756
It's a microwave projector.

53:02.342 --> 53:04.468
Power comes from here,

53:04.468 --> 53:07.387
and fires incredible microwave there.

53:08.348 --> 53:10.807
It shoots microwaves.

53:10.807 --> 53:13.435
A focused
and compressed microwave beam.

53:13.435 --> 53:14.603
I calculate.

53:14.603 --> 53:17.898
Enough high-density microwave
could break up their energy field.

53:18.650 --> 53:19.650
And what will it do?

53:19.650 --> 53:21.735
Knock them on their ass.

53:23.363 --> 53:24.363
Like, kill them?

53:24.572 --> 53:27.574
Slow, wound, kill, perhaps.

53:28.451 --> 53:30.952
Just think, they're like wave energy,

53:31.371 --> 53:34.665
and if we can connect their charge,

53:34.665 --> 53:36.958
maybe we create a chain reaction.

53:37.752 --> 53:39.920
Take a bunch out at once.

53:41.047 --> 53:42.047
Does it work?

53:44.467 --> 53:46.259
You fight fire with fire.

53:46.761 --> 53:48.387
Precisely.

53:49.639 --> 53:50.639
Drink coffee.

53:57.772 --> 53:59.815
The world's first alien killer.

54:00.441 --> 54:02.317
This guy sings to his cat.

54:02.610 --> 54:06.363
Yeah. But look at that cat.
So what do you think?

54:06.363 --> 54:09.282
I doubt the hope of all humanity
lies in sketchy homegrown science.

54:09.282 --> 54:11.368
Look, what if it works?

54:11.368 --> 54:15.038
- What if it blows us all up?
- Yeah, but what if it works?

54:29.637 --> 54:30.762
Vika.

54:37.645 --> 54:39.229
Vika, the apartment's upstairs.

54:39.229 --> 54:41.648
You won't make it.
I know where we can hide. Come on.

54:45.194 --> 54:46.236
I will take the cage.

54:46.988 --> 54:48.822
No. Annie.

55:03.212 --> 55:04.504
Annie.

55:07.341 --> 55:08.842
Nat. Nat.

55:15.391 --> 55:16.391
It's jammed.

55:17.018 --> 55:18.185
Nat.

55:18.603 --> 55:20.854
Nat, I can't move this table. I can't.

55:32.700 --> 55:33.700
Eat this.

55:38.372 --> 55:39.372
We did it.

55:45.880 --> 55:46.838
Keep firing.

55:48.049 --> 55:49.508
Hit it again.

55:50.718 --> 55:51.927
Sergei.

55:54.388 --> 55:56.640
Fire escape. Go. Go.

55:57.141 --> 55:58.725
- Come on.
- No, don't.

56:01.270 --> 56:02.479
Annie. Come on.

56:02.479 --> 56:03.647
I can't. I can't.

56:25.795 --> 56:27.420
Grab my arm.

56:35.263 --> 56:36.263
Annie.

56:53.781 --> 56:54.781
Mr. Sergei?

56:55.783 --> 56:57.075
Where is Anne?

56:58.369 --> 56:59.369
Come on.

57:14.552 --> 57:15.927
Keep moving.

57:20.474 --> 57:21.474
Hide behind us.

57:22.977 --> 57:24.519
What the hell is this?

57:25.688 --> 57:26.730
What the...

57:26.730 --> 57:27.898
Run. Run.

57:51.964 --> 57:52.964
Fire.

57:58.679 --> 57:59.679
Sasha go.

58:09.899 --> 58:10.899
Boris get ready.

58:11.859 --> 58:12.859
Fire.

58:19.533 --> 58:21.201
You don't like it bitch.

58:33.589 --> 58:35.674
Welcome to Russia, sucker.

58:42.181 --> 58:43.739
Thank you.

58:44.350 --> 58:45.725
Americans.

58:45.935 --> 58:47.310
Aliens bad for homeland,

58:47.853 --> 58:49.062
but good for business.

58:49.480 --> 58:50.605
What's that discharge?

58:51.399 --> 58:52.399
Microwaves.

58:52.775 --> 58:55.151
Like a big alien stun gun.

59:00.741 --> 59:01.741
What is this?

59:04.453 --> 59:07.539
When they generate their lightning,
their power drains.

59:07.832 --> 59:10.041
Its invisible shield is weakened.

59:10.041 --> 59:11.543
That's when we strike.

59:11.543 --> 59:13.211
Sean, just leave it. Let's go.

59:13.587 --> 59:17.048
We have dislodged fragments,
but we can only wound them.

59:17.258 --> 59:18.800
Yeah, but their armor cracks.

59:24.223 --> 59:25.223
Let's go.

01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:08.224
I am sorry about Anne.

01:00:20.696 --> 01:00:21.696
Where are you from?

01:00:23.574 --> 01:00:25.533
- Seattle.
- Ah, Nirvana.

01:00:26.243 --> 01:00:27.368
Yeah.

01:00:28.662 --> 01:00:30.747
Well, you can stay here
as long as you need.

01:00:31.373 --> 01:00:32.373
I can train you.

01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:38.171
Thanks, but we have to keep moving.

01:00:38.506 --> 01:00:39.506
Where?

01:00:44.178 --> 01:00:47.514
There's a submarine in the river,
it leaves in the morning.

01:00:48.015 --> 01:00:50.517
It's joining others. One from the U.S.

01:00:50.517 --> 01:00:51.810
Submarine?

01:00:52.061 --> 01:00:54.604
- Yeah.
- And you believe that?

01:00:56.857 --> 01:00:57.982
What's your name, son?

01:00:58.484 --> 01:00:59.567
Sean.

01:01:00.778 --> 01:01:02.112
You won't make it, Sean.

01:01:02.112 --> 01:01:03.738
Why not? We made it this far.

01:01:06.700 --> 01:01:07.909
No.

01:01:07.909 --> 01:01:09.828
You made it as far as Academy Plaza.

01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:12.038
And we made it here.

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.998
And we can make it further.

01:01:17.128 --> 01:01:18.378
Okay.

01:01:19.046 --> 01:01:20.964
- You want to go there?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:01:21.257 --> 01:01:25.093
But these areas,
here, here, here and here, are overrun.

01:01:26.178 --> 01:01:28.763
Enemy territory. You can't go through.

01:01:28.763 --> 01:01:30.223
You want to go around, like this?

01:01:30.766 --> 01:01:31.933
It would take five weeks.

01:01:32.518 --> 01:01:34.477
If your luck hasn't run out.

01:01:36.063 --> 01:01:39.065
You stay here, you eventually die.

01:01:40.693 --> 01:01:42.402
This is our home.

01:01:43.279 --> 01:01:46.156
When the enemy are this strong,
we can strike and run,

01:01:46.156 --> 01:01:47.365
watching for weaknesses.

01:01:47.365 --> 01:01:50.910
We return to camp, but we never retreat.

01:01:51.996 --> 01:01:53.705
So, yes.

01:01:53.705 --> 01:01:56.833
We will die tomorrow, but today,

01:01:56.833 --> 01:01:59.669
we will kill at least one of the enemy.

01:02:01.672 --> 01:02:03.381
I am sorry, we cannot help you.

01:02:03.632 --> 01:02:05.908
I know you think we don't have a chance but,

01:02:06.886 --> 01:02:08.303
we have to try.

01:02:09.513 --> 01:02:11.431
This isn't our home.

01:02:15.436 --> 01:02:17.645
Sean's right, we have to try.

01:02:22.818 --> 01:02:25.528
You know what? You're right.

01:02:26.447 --> 01:02:29.282
We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.

01:02:30.492 --> 01:02:33.578
But what the hell is the point in saving
people if you don't see them home?

01:02:34.413 --> 01:02:35.997
Your mission is to dig in here

01:02:35.997 --> 01:02:39.459
so you can die in a slightly different way?

01:02:39.459 --> 01:02:40.627
Here's our mission.

01:02:41.086 --> 01:02:42.962
We're going to get on that submarine,

01:02:42.962 --> 01:02:45.298
get together with whatever other survivors
might be out there,

01:02:45.298 --> 01:02:47.634
and fight the hell back.

01:02:51.555 --> 01:02:52.805
So why don't we get on that sub

01:02:52.805 --> 01:02:55.058
and get you and your men
some real weapons?

01:02:56.268 --> 01:02:58.478
Instead of settling for this.

01:03:01.649 --> 01:03:03.483
I am coming with you.

01:03:14.578 --> 01:03:16.079
They are kids...

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:20.708
Hey.

01:03:23.462 --> 01:03:25.588
We will use the metro.

01:03:25.588 --> 01:03:26.965
It's our best shot.

01:03:29.594 --> 01:03:32.800
You have command
until we get back.

01:03:48.195 --> 01:03:50.530
That's nice work back there.

01:03:50.530 --> 01:03:51.906
That was all Natalie.

01:04:08.924 --> 01:04:10.550
Are you guys hearing that?

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:14.220
Sasha.

01:04:28.068 --> 01:04:29.110
Onwards.

01:04:30.779 --> 01:04:31.946
Are you sure?

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:42.165
Come on. Down to the tracks.

01:04:49.173 --> 01:04:50.590
Oh, my...

01:04:50.841 --> 01:04:52.425
Stay low.

01:04:54.303 --> 01:04:55.595
- Ben.
- Vika.

01:04:55.804 --> 01:04:57.305
What is that?

01:05:03.771 --> 01:05:04.896
Oh, my God.

01:05:06.148 --> 01:05:07.148
Ben, what are you doing?

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.817
Be careful.

01:05:14.031 --> 01:05:15.031
Vika, come on.

01:05:15.031 --> 01:05:16.783
Oh, my God. Ben.

01:05:19.913 --> 01:05:22.205
- No.
- Shit.

01:05:22.205 --> 01:05:23.289
No.

01:05:23.289 --> 01:05:25.716
- Sean.
- Ben.

01:05:33.634 --> 01:05:34.384
No.

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:40.890
Sean.

01:05:42.434 --> 01:05:44.560
We have to go.

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.396
Come on.

01:06:19.388 --> 01:06:21.347
Which way? Which way?

01:06:28.021 --> 01:06:28.980
On that boat.

01:06:30.149 --> 01:06:31.232
The river flows north.

01:06:31.232 --> 01:06:32.984
We will drift to the submarine.

01:06:43.871 --> 01:06:45.288
Get below.

01:07:20.657 --> 01:07:22.325
Hey.

01:07:24.786 --> 01:07:26.496
It's okay.

01:07:27.247 --> 01:07:29.957
It's okay. It's not your fault.

01:08:01.114 --> 01:08:02.448
Our moms

01:08:03.951 --> 01:08:06.077
were on PTA together.

01:08:06.453 --> 01:08:08.496
He was in the smart class.

01:08:09.373 --> 01:08:11.624
His mom made him play with me.

01:08:15.295 --> 01:08:17.630
I sort of never got over it.

01:08:31.979 --> 01:08:33.979
I am thinking we should say goodbye.

01:08:34.481 --> 01:08:35.481
What?

01:08:39.528 --> 01:08:42.321
I never got a chance to say it to Ben.

01:08:44.366 --> 01:08:46.533
Okay. Well,

01:08:49.037 --> 01:08:51.122
I will be seeing you around.

01:08:52.416 --> 01:08:53.499
Yeah.

01:08:58.714 --> 01:08:59.714
Give me your hand.

01:09:03.218 --> 01:09:04.260
What's happening?

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.469
We have run aground.

01:09:11.475 --> 01:09:12.852
Oh, my God.

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:18.858
This is why they came.
We're just in the way.

01:09:18.858 --> 01:09:20.192
What do they want?

01:09:20.611 --> 01:09:22.111
We are mineral-rich.

01:09:22.738 --> 01:09:23.821
Copper, nickel.

01:09:24.197 --> 01:09:26.823
Metals that conduct electricity.

01:09:26.823 --> 01:09:28.117
It must be food.

01:09:33.707 --> 01:09:34.832
There it is.

01:09:35.375 --> 01:09:37.209
The submarine.

01:09:39.046 --> 01:09:40.046
We're going to make it.

01:09:40.046 --> 01:09:41.631
We're going to make it. It's our way out.

01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:50.555
What is it?

01:09:58.231 --> 01:09:59.357
Shit.

01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:01.275
Sean.

01:10:39.398 --> 01:10:40.773
Sean.

01:10:41.858 --> 01:10:43.275
Natalie?

01:10:45.696 --> 01:10:48.656
- Natalie.
- Natalie.

01:10:49.491 --> 01:10:51.117
Sean, swim.

01:10:58.834 --> 01:11:00.334
Natalie.

01:11:01.962 --> 01:11:04.630
Swim, now. Swim.

01:11:13.849 --> 01:11:15.182
Here, give me your hand.

01:11:15.475 --> 01:11:17.643
Come on, son. Come on.

01:11:24.651 --> 01:11:26.819
There's someone else out there.

01:11:27.904 --> 01:11:30.531
Her name's Natalie.
She must have swam ashore upriver.

01:11:30.531 --> 01:11:31.907
I watched your boat go over.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.660
I don't want to lose this one.
We can't wait any longer.

01:11:34.660 --> 01:11:35.745
I won't leave her.

01:11:35.745 --> 01:11:38.497
I had orders
not to depart without survivors.

01:11:38.497 --> 01:11:40.082
- Now we have to sail.
- Whose orders?

01:11:40.333 --> 01:11:41.500
Captain Nikolai Ivanov.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:43.878
- I will speak to him. Where is he?
- Dead.

01:11:48.508 --> 01:11:49.717
Flares.

01:11:53.013 --> 01:11:55.306
That's her. That's Natalie.

01:11:55.306 --> 01:11:58.601
Look, I am not asking you
to go out there, okay?

01:11:58.601 --> 01:12:00.060
Just to delay your departure.

01:12:00.060 --> 01:12:01.562
This area is infested.

01:12:01.562 --> 01:12:03.481
I am sorry,
but her chances for survival are not good.

01:12:03.481 --> 01:12:05.649
Look, she knows how to hide. Trust me.

01:12:05.649 --> 01:12:06.901
You go back out there, your chances...

01:12:06.901 --> 01:12:09.028
He knows what his chances are.

01:12:09.028 --> 01:12:10.446
We have all lost comrades.

01:12:12.199 --> 01:12:13.365
She's alive.

01:12:13.658 --> 01:12:15.618
And right now, every one of us count.

01:12:15.827 --> 01:12:17.703
We can't leave her.

01:12:18.413 --> 01:12:20.998
If she was one of yours,
you'd want the same.

01:12:22.209 --> 01:12:23.209
Okay.

01:12:23.209 --> 01:12:26.504
Okay. Let's get under
and make a battle plan.

01:12:27.798 --> 01:12:29.423
The new gun is almost ready.

01:12:29.883 --> 01:12:32.250
The extra microwave gun
gives us a chance.

01:12:32.719 --> 01:12:34.637
The man who built it...

01:12:34.637 --> 01:12:37.556
...thought we could microwave
their invisible shield.

01:12:38.058 --> 01:12:39.475
But to "F" them up,

01:12:40.018 --> 01:12:44.021
Mr. Sergei said
that we need much more power.

01:12:44.231 --> 01:12:46.857
More batteries will launch a stronger beam.

01:12:47.317 --> 01:12:49.193
You will get four or five good shots at it.

01:12:49.193 --> 01:12:51.786
We need to wrap the power packs
so they don't short out.

01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:54.490
Get the lead blankets
out of radiation...

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:55.741
Hurry.

01:12:56.827 --> 01:12:59.578
The microwave guns
disrupt their defense shields.

01:13:00.288 --> 01:13:01.539
And then we kill it.

01:13:01.915 --> 01:13:04.250
With good old Russian bullets.

01:13:04.250 --> 01:13:07.461
We get to where the flares were fired, here,

01:13:07.461 --> 01:13:09.088
find the girl and get out.

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:12.049
I will take Sasha's place.

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:19.682
Boris and me. Yuri and Sean.

01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:22.101
Microwave guns lead.

01:13:51.339 --> 01:13:53.048
Her flares came from that direction.

01:14:04.936 --> 01:14:06.478
There is not much cover.

01:14:42.515 --> 01:14:46.475
- "Natalie."
- "Natalie."

01:15:11.378 --> 01:15:12.378
It's not working.

01:15:14.005 --> 01:15:15.047
Let's go.

01:15:22.555 --> 01:15:24.890
Six o'clock. Spread out.

01:15:29.896 --> 01:15:30.896
Come on.

01:15:43.576 --> 01:15:44.576
Shoot it.

01:15:45.912 --> 01:15:47.079
Come on.

01:16:04.639 --> 01:16:05.639
Kill it.

01:16:19.404 --> 01:16:20.612
The stun gun, it works.

01:16:24.617 --> 01:16:26.076
Yeah.

01:16:26.076 --> 01:16:27.161
Sean.

01:16:31.041 --> 01:16:32.124
Sean.

01:16:33.626 --> 01:16:34.793
Natalie.

01:16:35.295 --> 01:16:36.795
Eight o'clock.

01:16:36.795 --> 01:16:38.547
There's too many.

01:16:41.259 --> 01:16:42.634
Our guns won't last.

01:16:43.553 --> 01:16:44.553
Follow me.

01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:52.019
It's water.

01:16:52.019 --> 01:16:54.813
It will connect its charge
and create a chain reaction.

01:16:54.813 --> 01:16:55.898
You are certain?

01:16:55.898 --> 01:16:58.833
Wait until they're over the water
to fire the microwave gun.

01:16:58.833 --> 01:16:59.902
Take the flanks.

01:17:00.236 --> 01:17:01.653
I will get Natalie.

01:17:16.586 --> 01:17:18.879
Prepare to fight.

01:17:34.354 --> 01:17:36.522
They stopped before the water.

01:17:38.066 --> 01:17:39.691
The plan is not working.

01:17:42.612 --> 01:17:44.071
- Natalie?
- Sean.

01:17:44.489 --> 01:17:45.864
Bus 19.

01:17:46.741 --> 01:17:48.742
Be careful. They're out there.

01:18:03.383 --> 01:18:04.633
It's Vika.
Vika, what are you doing?

01:18:05.844 --> 01:18:06.844
Where did she come from?

01:18:09.722 --> 01:18:12.015
It's working. They're over the water.

01:18:12.015 --> 01:18:13.976
We can beat them.

01:18:38.668 --> 01:18:39.918
Natalie.

01:18:40.295 --> 01:18:41.420
Sean.

01:18:45.592 --> 01:18:46.592
You came back for me.

01:18:46.592 --> 01:18:47.759
Of course I did.

01:19:07.822 --> 01:19:09.072
Sean.

01:19:23.796 --> 01:19:24.796
Get the wheel.

01:19:30.929 --> 01:19:31.929
I can't stop it.

01:19:39.938 --> 01:19:41.188
Hold on.

01:19:45.193 --> 01:19:46.985
- Shoot it again.
- It's not working.

01:19:48.947 --> 01:19:49.947
Sean.

01:19:50.406 --> 01:19:51.406
The battery is dead.

01:20:01.042 --> 01:20:02.376
Sean.

01:20:46.004 --> 01:20:47.587
Come on. Let's go.

01:20:52.093 --> 01:20:55.637
We did it. Let's go.
We got them for now.

01:20:55.637 --> 01:20:57.597
Let's get out of here.

01:21:04.406 --> 01:21:06.481
Come on. Come on.

01:21:11.195 --> 01:21:12.362
Are you sure you're not coming?

01:21:13.573 --> 01:21:15.782
Hell, we got a nuclear submarine.

01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:21.038
Today, we learned how to fight.

01:21:21.038 --> 01:21:24.333
Go, and teach the others what we know.

01:21:24.917 --> 01:21:27.085
This is the last day of the extermination,

01:21:27.545 --> 01:21:29.755
and the first day of war.

01:21:31.674 --> 01:21:32.883
No changing your mind?

01:21:34.761 --> 01:21:37.095
I can go no further.

01:21:37.095 --> 01:21:38.972
I have Moscow at my back.

01:22:06.417 --> 01:22:08.043
- There you are.
- Did you get it?

01:22:08.043 --> 01:22:09.920
Yes, I replaced the damaged parts.

01:22:10.129 --> 01:22:12.297
It will work inside the sub.

01:23:05.768 --> 01:23:09.521
Here in London, I picked
up signals from others around the globe.

01:23:09.521 --> 01:23:11.440
Europe, Asia, the States.

01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.567
There are people fighting back.

01:23:13.567 --> 01:23:16.611
I even had contact with a militia group
out of Paris.

01:23:16.611 --> 01:23:19.531
They took down
one of those mining towers.

01:23:19.531 --> 01:23:20.615
They destroyed a tower.

01:23:20.615 --> 01:23:22.117
I have been hearing all types of stories.

01:23:22.117 --> 01:23:24.077
I have got them here on tape.

01:23:24.077 --> 01:23:27.706
Toronto, Lima, Peru, Berlin and Shanghai...

01:23:27.706 --> 01:23:29.458
This is how it starts.

01:23:29.458 --> 01:23:31.293
# We will rise against #

01:23:31.293 --> 01:23:34.629
# Even though we don't know
where we should begin #

01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:37.799
# Even though we can't see around the bend #

01:23:37.799 --> 01:23:42.930
# Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again #

01:23:42.930 --> 01:23:44.723
# We will rise against #

01:23:44.723 --> 01:23:48.101
# Even though we don't know
where we should begin #

01:23:48.101 --> 01:23:51.396
# Even though we can't see around the bend #

01:23:51.396 --> 01:23:56.485
# Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again #

01:24:12.877 --> 01:24:14.920
# We will rise against #

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:18.215
# Even though we don't know
where we should begin #

01:24:18.215 --> 01:24:21.593
# Even though we can't see around the bend #

01:24:21.593 --> 01:24:26.097
# Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again #

01:24:26.557 --> 01:24:28.517
# We will rise against #

01:24:28.517 --> 01:24:31.686
# Even though we don't know
where we should begin #

01:24:31.686 --> 01:24:34.940
# Even though we can't see around the bend #

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:39.820
# Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again #

01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.696
# We will rise against #

01:24:41.696 --> 01:24:45.116
# Even though we don't know
where we should begin #

01:24:45.116 --> 01:24:48.537
# Even though we can't see around the bend #

01:24:48.537 --> 01:24:53.959
# Oh, we know, we know that we will rise again #
