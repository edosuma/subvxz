WEBVTT

00:01.363 --> 00:03.858
Okay, folks, you might want
to put on some sunscreen.

00:03.901 --> 00:06.989
Up this high,
the trees start to thin out.

00:07.032 --> 00:08.512
Oh, this might be
a good place for a picture.

00:08.554 --> 00:09.611
Oh, let me go behind that rock.

00:09.654 --> 00:11.008
I'll change into my next look.

00:11.050 --> 00:12.066
Another one?

00:12.107 --> 00:14.392
He has to.
His Instagram follower demands it.

00:14.434 --> 00:15.238
Eagle!

00:15.280 --> 00:16.719
Oh, wait, false alarm.

00:16.761 --> 00:18.242
It's just a plastic bag in a tree.

00:18.283 --> 00:19.003
Eagle!

00:19.045 --> 00:20.483
Nope. Sorry.

00:20.526 --> 00:21.542
Bag fell.

00:22.810 --> 00:23.910
Every winter,

00:23.952 --> 00:26.236
I take a bird-watching
trip with my buddies...

00:26.279 --> 00:28.182
specifically to see a bald eagle.

00:28.225 --> 00:29.959
So far, no luck.

00:30.002 --> 00:33.302
This year, my buddies bailed...
back spasm, cracked hip.

00:33.344 --> 00:36.178
And I'm the idiot for
installing a shower chair.

00:36.221 --> 00:37.912
I was all set to go solo,

00:37.955 --> 00:40.620
when those three tagalongs
invited themselves.

00:40.662 --> 00:42.185
They invaded my territory

00:42.228 --> 00:44.723
like a bunch of bay-breasted warblers.

00:44.765 --> 00:46.923
Darned if I didn't feel
like a bay-breasted warbler

00:46.965 --> 00:50.391
horning in on Jay's trip,
but Gloria made us go.

00:50.434 --> 00:51.873
She was worried about my dad

00:51.914 --> 00:53.776
being out in the woods alone at his age,

00:53.819 --> 00:56.398
so she... she gently
nudged us to join him.

00:56.441 --> 00:58.979
Gloria, if my dad doesn't want us t...

00:59.022 --> 01:00.954
Hey, Dad, uh,
whatcha doin' this weekend?

01:01.048 --> 01:03.633
- Ah, little nature trip.
- Oh! Sounds like fun.

01:03.675 --> 01:04.521
- Count us in!
- Yes.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.424
Actually, I was looking
for a little alone time...

01:06.467 --> 01:09.978
Hey! Am I the only one with
bald eagles on the brain?

01:10.803 --> 01:12.305
You know what?
I think in about 10 minutes,

01:12.347 --> 01:15.519
the light's gonna be perfect for my
"Afternoon Adventurer" look.

01:15.562 --> 01:17.593
Okay, uh, before we head
deeper into the woods,

01:17.634 --> 01:20.977
I should warn you folks that there's
been several bear sightings in the area.

01:21.019 --> 01:23.261
- So if you happen to have any food with you...
- Got it!

01:26.096 --> 01:29.691
I was going to say you can store
it in this bear box... here.

01:29.734 --> 01:30.707
Oh. Um, okay.

01:30.748 --> 01:32.272
Well, then, talk amongst yourselves.

01:32.313 --> 01:33.710
It could take me a while

01:33.752 --> 01:35.782
to find where my manly
heave sent that heavy...

01:35.825 --> 01:37.940
Ah! Here it is.
Someone must've heaved it back.

01:37.982 --> 01:39.330
Thank you!

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:53.897 --> 01:55.112
Hello!

01:55.190 --> 01:57.640
Oh, hey, Gloria. Thanks for coming.

01:57.683 --> 01:58.946
It's gonna be such a fun girls' night...

01:58.989 --> 02:01.687
drinking wine, planning the nursery.

02:01.731 --> 02:02.993
Okay, I was going to surprise you,

02:03.037 --> 02:05.909
but I can't wait anymore.

02:05.953 --> 02:09.826
It's a handmade mobile
of great women in history!

02:09.870 --> 02:11.393
Eleanor Roosevelt,

02:11.436 --> 02:12.263
Rosa Parks!

02:12.307 --> 02:13.308
Ohh!

02:13.351 --> 02:15.963
I just hope it goes with the theme
that Dylan wants for the room.

02:16.006 --> 02:17.747
Are any of these women
important in the fields

02:17.791 --> 02:19.705
of fire trucks or unicorns?

02:19.749 --> 02:20.550
Oh!

02:20.594 --> 02:22.552
How perfect is this?

02:22.596 --> 02:27.339
They delivered the crib,
and I know just the crew of handy honeys

02:27.383 --> 02:28.732
to help me put it together.

02:28.776 --> 02:30.647
Uh, not now, Mom.
I've had the worst day.

02:30.691 --> 02:31.648
Me, too.

02:31.692 --> 02:32.867
Quick, start crying.

02:32.910 --> 02:34.869
We need to derail her
enthusiasm before she's...

02:34.912 --> 02:36.653
Unh! Too late.

02:36.697 --> 02:37.915
She's dancing.

02:37.959 --> 02:40.178
Way to rock it, girlfriend!

02:41.136 --> 02:43.051
I cannot deny it anymore.

02:43.094 --> 02:45.880
I am turning into a white woman.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.536
Is there a problem, girlfriends?

02:50.580 --> 02:52.016
Spin class was canceled!

02:52.628 --> 02:53.452
No!

02:53.496 --> 02:55.280
What are we gonna do with our day?

02:55.324 --> 02:56.760
"When In Doubt...

02:56.804 --> 02:57.805
Brunch."

02:57.848 --> 02:59.371
Where's the nearest
place that serves kale

02:59.415 --> 03:01.286
and also has a pun in its name?

03:01.330 --> 03:03.593
There's an Underground
Kale-Road down the street!

03:03.637 --> 03:05.943
- Let's go!
- Thank God.

03:05.987 --> 03:07.815
I've gotten soft lately.

03:07.858 --> 03:10.121
I think I've lost my Colombian edge.

03:10.165 --> 03:12.689
I think we'll all feel better
if we accomplish something.

03:12.733 --> 03:13.864
Yes. Unlike Jay.

03:13.908 --> 03:17.694
He's been going on these
hunting trips for 20 years,

03:17.738 --> 03:21.045
and not once has he
brought home a bald eagle!

03:25.876 --> 03:26.703
Oh, God.

03:26.747 --> 03:28.270
Hendrix couldn't read music,

03:28.313 --> 03:29.967
Shaq couldn't make free throws,

03:30.011 --> 03:32.796
and I have a little trouble
visualizing space and scale.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.146
So, I think this closet design
gives us everything we need

03:35.190 --> 03:36.757
in a tight, residential space.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.758
Yeah. Very clever.

03:37.801 --> 03:38.976
Take a walk-through.

03:39.020 --> 03:40.935
Does the flow make sense?

03:40.978 --> 03:41.892
Well, um...

03:42.433 --> 03:44.373
I would get out of the shower

03:44.416 --> 03:46.984
and throw my clothes in the hamper here,

03:47.028 --> 03:48.551
pick out an outfit,
and then get dressed right here.

03:49.770 --> 03:51.423
You just threw your
clothes in the fireplace

03:51.467 --> 03:53.121
and got dressed in front
of the picture window.

03:53.164 --> 03:56.428
Well, you have
your morning routine, Mia.

03:56.472 --> 03:58.387
I have mine.

03:59.225 --> 04:01.303
All right, let's get this over with.

04:01.346 --> 04:02.870
Mom, where do we start?

04:02.913 --> 04:03.823
Um...

04:03.853 --> 04:06.961
Maybe Mommy just needs
some cougar juice!

04:08.105 --> 04:09.920
What's wrong with me?

04:11.340 --> 04:12.616
Watch your step, folks.

04:12.654 --> 04:15.578
Some of the terrain gets a little
tricky on this part of the hike.

04:15.621 --> 04:16.753
- Oh. Good.
- I thought I'd changed

04:16.797 --> 04:19.538
into my "Remote Trailhead"
look too soon.

04:19.582 --> 04:21.540
You okay, Dad?
Want to stop and take a break?

04:21.584 --> 04:23.934
No, no. I just want to stop
and maybe see an eagle.

04:23.978 --> 04:25.283
Everybody look.

04:28.149 --> 04:30.201
You've been doing this for 20
years and never seen one, huh?

04:30.245 --> 04:31.899
Correct. Shh.

04:31.942 --> 04:33.378
Oh.

04:35.032 --> 04:36.904
Yeah. Mother Nature can be a real...

04:36.947 --> 04:38.993
Phil, stop talking!

04:39.036 --> 04:40.603
You're scaring the eagles!

04:40.646 --> 04:42.997
I'm sorry. My bad. My bad.

04:43.040 --> 04:45.826
- Also sorry in my head.
- Oh, my God!

04:45.869 --> 04:48.132
Since we're talking again, uh,
we should start heading back.

04:48.176 --> 04:49.612
It'll be dark soon.

04:49.655 --> 04:51.962
Or, if you'd like,
there's a cabin just up this trail.

04:52.006 --> 04:53.137
It's pretty run-down, but, uh,

04:53.181 --> 04:54.225
you're welcome to spend the night.

04:54.269 --> 04:56.010
- I'll do it.
- Oh.

04:56.053 --> 04:57.576
Are... Are we sure that's a good idea?

04:57.620 --> 04:59.840
Um... wasn't there...
wasn't there mention of bears?

04:59.883 --> 05:02.146
No, you go home. I'll stay by myself.

05:02.190 --> 05:04.010
We... We can't let him stay by himself.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.494
We told Gloria we'd keep him safe.

05:05.563 --> 05:07.173
Yeah, if he's staying, we're staying.

05:07.267 --> 05:09.922
Yeah. Yeah. What...
What's the worst that could happen?

05:09.965 --> 05:11.619
I mean, in the movies,
when city folk stay overnight

05:11.663 --> 05:14.492
in abandoned cabins,
things usually pan out okay.

05:14.535 --> 05:16.537
Anyway, I'm gonna run ahead,
see if they have any postcards

05:16.581 --> 05:19.192
up at this poorly guarded
mental institution.

05:20.976 --> 05:22.848
Damn it, I'm starving.

05:22.891 --> 05:24.980
Nothing in here but an
old bottle of whiskey.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.982
Well, just try not to think
about how hungry you are

05:27.026 --> 05:28.593
or that Mitchell left
the food in the bear box.

05:28.636 --> 05:30.595
We all left the food in the...

05:30.638 --> 05:31.422
Did you change again?

05:32.466 --> 05:33.859
Yeah, I just threw a few things together

05:33.902 --> 05:35.643
to create a "Rustic Cabin" look.

05:35.687 --> 05:38.254
Well, at least the bears
won't be a concern.

05:38.298 --> 05:39.604
Take it from a Realtor.

05:39.647 --> 05:41.823
This Smith & Wiley lock
is the gold standard.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.621
All right, I think we are now ready

05:51.664 --> 05:56.159
to put together our beautiful,
L-shaped crib.

05:56.202 --> 05:58.584
I-I... This can't be right.
One's way bigger.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.051
And what, my babies are supposed
to come and go as they please,

06:01.094 --> 06:02.582
like they're in a halfway house?

06:02.624 --> 06:05.943
Um, so, a minor
misreading of the diagram.

06:05.986 --> 06:09.006
I think we're just gonna need to
swap a short side for a long side.

06:09.048 --> 06:10.281
And in the meantime,
we bent that bracket.

06:10.324 --> 06:12.706
Alex, would you mind running
down to the hardware store?

06:12.749 --> 06:14.024
No way.

06:14.067 --> 06:15.939
I don't trust myself to drive anymore.

06:15.981 --> 06:17.896
I signed up to be the student liaison

06:17.938 --> 06:19.426
for a visiting scholar on campus...

06:19.469 --> 06:20.958
Sir Kenneth Penrose.

06:21.001 --> 06:23.340
Yes, that Sir Kenneth Penrose.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.425
Rock star of the microbiology world.

06:25.468 --> 06:27.041
I know you must hear this a lot,

06:27.083 --> 06:28.785
but you're the reason I took up snooker.

06:28.828 --> 06:29.848
Do you still play?

06:29.891 --> 06:31.805
I've had to lay down my cue lately.

06:31.848 --> 06:34.443
I've been working for
months on an Ebola vaccine.

06:34.485 --> 06:36.102
Just moments ago, I had a breakthrough.

06:36.144 --> 06:38.015
I can't wait to get
to the lab and jot...

06:38.058 --> 06:39.335
- Hey!
- Aah!

06:40.483 --> 06:42.397
Whoa! That was my chemistry advisor.

06:42.440 --> 06:44.524
I would not want to be
known as the girl who...

06:45.545 --> 06:46.506
Sir Kenneth?

06:47.757 --> 06:49.160
W-Where am I?

06:49.203 --> 06:50.990
You don't know the shame.

06:51.032 --> 06:52.266
Now they won't let me drive around

06:52.309 --> 06:54.941
anyone smarter than a
sociology professor.

06:54.984 --> 06:56.983
You know what else
hit the ground today? Me.

06:57.026 --> 07:00.386
While I was bending over to
pickup a doughnut off the floor!

07:00.429 --> 07:02.087
It was covered in dust balls,
but I didn't care,

07:02.130 --> 07:03.619
'cause I'm a disgusting pig monster.

07:03.661 --> 07:04.597
Oh, honey, please.

07:04.639 --> 07:06.001
You're as...

07:06.044 --> 07:07.319
as beautiful as ever.

07:07.362 --> 07:09.149
Tell that to MugScan.

07:09.191 --> 07:12.849
MugScan is a face-recognition
program we use at work.

07:12.892 --> 07:14.636
It was really mean to me.

07:16.848 --> 07:17.869
Good morning, Wayne.

07:17.911 --> 07:18.848
Wayne?

07:18.890 --> 07:20.676
I'm not Wayne, you jerk!

07:21.698 --> 07:23.483
Gosh!

07:31.693 --> 07:32.460
You all right, Haley?

07:33.480 --> 07:35.522
I'm fine, Wayne.

07:35.565 --> 07:37.862
One of my shoes flew off in the fall,

07:37.904 --> 07:40.371
and I couldn't put it back on
because my feet were so swollen.

07:40.413 --> 07:43.264
You know who makes a great shoe?
New Balance.

07:43.307 --> 07:45.390
I wear them when I
power-walk to Neil Diamond.

07:46.369 --> 07:49.262
Hey, Mom,
is this divider a little too high?

07:49.304 --> 07:50.920
No. No, it's supposed to be that way.

07:50.963 --> 07:53.302
That way, if one twin
wants to visit the other,

07:53.345 --> 07:56.662
he can just go,
"Ah, doot, doot, doot. Hi!"

07:56.705 --> 07:58.534
- Aaaah!
- Hey!

07:59.641 --> 08:02.022
Couple thoughts.

08:03.044 --> 08:04.915
- Pair of 7s.
- Ace high.

08:04.957 --> 08:07.765
Everyone, I'd like you to
meet Don Lemon and RuPaul,

08:07.808 --> 08:09.193
a pair of black queens.

08:09.637 --> 08:11.679
Mitchell, that's the third time
you've wandered over there.

08:11.721 --> 08:12.869
What are you doing?

08:12.912 --> 08:14.954
- Nothing.
- He's got something in his mouth.

08:14.996 --> 08:16.571
- Get him!
- No. No, I don't. - Come here!

08:16.613 --> 08:19.080
- No, no, no!
- Don't... Don't fight. Don't...

08:19.123 --> 08:20.143
He has beef jerky!

08:20.186 --> 08:21.266
That's the last of it. I swear.

08:21.327 --> 08:22.998
- He's lying. Check his pockets.
- No, I...

08:23.461 --> 08:25.606
- Stop it, stop it, stop it!
- It's a family pack!

08:25.697 --> 08:27.866
I hope the jerky was as
delicious as the irony.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.780
- Give it!
- No, stop it! Stop it...

08:29.823 --> 08:31.355
No!

08:31.397 --> 08:32.375
Great.

08:32.418 --> 08:34.077
We're sending beef smoke signals

08:34.120 --> 08:35.650
to a forest full of bears.

08:35.693 --> 08:37.437
I'm sorry! I should've shared!

08:37.480 --> 08:39.777
Meanwhile,
there is a sack full of hiking snacks

08:39.820 --> 08:40.755
just up the road!

08:40.798 --> 08:41.732
Brie, prosciutto,

08:41.775 --> 08:44.328
not to mention a wonderful
maple-walnut butter

08:44.370 --> 08:46.625
that Gloria recommended
on her Pinterest board.

08:46.668 --> 08:47.604
That's it. I'm going out there.

08:47.647 --> 08:48.582
Jay, wait!

08:48.625 --> 08:51.177
If you see a bear, remember...

08:51.219 --> 08:52.750
blind it with the flash on your phone,

08:52.793 --> 08:54.835
then lie on your back
in a submissive pose.

08:54.877 --> 08:56.962
I'm not doing that.
If I come face-to-face with a bear,

08:57.004 --> 08:57.982
he better run!

09:03.215 --> 09:04.704
It's darker out there...

09:04.746 --> 09:06.235
Aaaaaaaah!

09:07.893 --> 09:09.681
Are you sure it was the best idea

09:09.723 --> 09:11.339
to attach these before
moving them upstairs?

09:11.382 --> 09:14.572
Yeah, I eyeballed the space.
It really should fit easily.

09:14.615 --> 09:15.532
Ow!

09:16.231 --> 09:18.486
Except Alex apparently
has steered us into a jam.

09:19.370 --> 09:21.633
Oh, that must be the pizza guy.
Coming, Carl!

09:21.676 --> 09:23.505
You know the pizza guy's name?

09:23.548 --> 09:24.696
No!

09:27.163 --> 09:28.950
- Hi.
- Hey, Haley.

09:28.993 --> 09:31.332
Surprised to get an order
from you before midnight.

09:31.375 --> 09:33.800
By the way, how'd you like that
custom shrimp and potato pizza?

09:33.842 --> 09:36.862
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

09:36.905 --> 09:38.265
Loved it. Love you.

09:38.308 --> 09:39.457
Gonna go get my wallet!

09:43.058 --> 09:44.178
Mom?

09:44.220 --> 09:44.989
Okay.

09:45.046 --> 09:47.412
Alex, run downstairs
and get a screwdriver.

09:47.454 --> 09:49.453
This whole thing will fit easily
once we take the cribs apart.

09:49.495 --> 09:50.389
We don't even know

09:50.432 --> 09:52.941
if this thing is gonna fit
through the bedroom door.

09:52.984 --> 09:54.387
Of course it will.

09:54.430 --> 09:57.195
But if it makes you happy,
I will measure again.

09:57.237 --> 09:58.599
Hmm.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.172
Hmm?

10:02.852 --> 10:03.831
See?

10:06.936 --> 10:08.594
You always record over my programs...

10:08.637 --> 10:09.914
Whoa!

10:09.956 --> 10:11.402
Gah! Aah!

10:11.444 --> 10:13.529
- Oh!
- Ow!

10:15.954 --> 10:17.613
Okay, no, how about this?

10:17.656 --> 10:20.530
We all band together to form one big man

10:20.564 --> 10:21.313
to go get the food.

10:21.356 --> 10:22.633
- No!
- How's that supposed to work?

10:22.675 --> 10:24.542
Okay, back to back, um, and...
and then link arms.

10:24.627 --> 10:26.478
- Okay.
- Turn around, give me your arm.

10:26.569 --> 10:28.228
See, look? Like this, all right?

10:28.271 --> 10:30.950
- Do we look big and scary?
- Well, I think so.

10:30.993 --> 10:32.737
Let's move towards the door.

10:34.873 --> 10:36.608
Okay.

10:36.650 --> 10:38.777
Nice and easy.

10:38.820 --> 10:43.669
We're just one big man
out for a walk in the woods.

10:43.712 --> 10:44.903
Scatter!

10:44.945 --> 10:46.519
Aah!

10:47.965 --> 10:49.624
We made it. Oh!

10:49.667 --> 10:51.190
Wait! Where's Mitchell?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.211
He didn't make it!

10:52.254 --> 10:53.402
One of you two need to go get him!

10:53.444 --> 10:55.274
I'm better staying here as a bear decoy.

10:55.316 --> 10:56.550
I give off a natural musk.

10:56.593 --> 10:59.145
Birds land on me all the time.
Squirrels eat out of my hand.

10:59.188 --> 11:01.101
Well, I can't go!
Lily needs at least one living parent!

11:03.101 --> 11:04.079
Wait!

11:04.121 --> 11:05.355
How do we know it's not the bear?

11:05.398 --> 11:07.629
It's me!

11:07.780 --> 11:09.141
You just left me!

11:09.183 --> 11:10.890
Oh, you weren't out there that long.

11:10.932 --> 11:12.165
You didn't get the food?!

11:12.208 --> 11:13.442
I almost was food!

11:13.485 --> 11:16.164
Okay, I-I wish I never even
came on this stupid trip!

11:16.207 --> 11:17.185
Well, who forced you?

11:17.227 --> 11:18.307
Gloria!

11:23.336 --> 11:24.863
It's my delivery ankle.

11:24.906 --> 11:26.392
It's really bad, dudes.

11:26.434 --> 11:29.068
It was already weak from
your paintball injury, Carl.

11:29.110 --> 11:30.597
I told you to get it checked out,

11:30.639 --> 11:31.829
but you and doctors.

11:33.230 --> 11:35.608
Okay, fine, I know him a little.

11:35.651 --> 11:37.307
When it rains, it pours, huh?

11:37.350 --> 11:38.497
- Margaret-Anne left me this morning.
- Aw!

11:38.539 --> 11:41.214
Then my dad called me
"Craig" on the phone again.

11:41.257 --> 11:42.744
That's the name of his new son.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.909
Oh, God. Carl, can we
at least drive you home?

11:45.411 --> 11:46.226
Not now.

11:46.268 --> 11:49.072
I have 10 pizzas going to my enemies,
the Sigmas.

11:49.114 --> 11:51.832
Those rich kids get their
kicks taking advantage

11:51.875 --> 11:53.064
of our "30 Minutes or it's Free"
policy...

11:53.106 --> 11:55.018
use every trick in the
book to slow me down.

11:55.060 --> 11:57.056
Well, not tonight, Chad and Chip.

11:57.098 --> 11:58.203
Not to... Aaaah!

11:58.245 --> 12:00.157
The bone's got to be sticking out,
right?

12:00.198 --> 12:02.704
No, it's not even swollen.

12:02.747 --> 12:04.701
Look, Carl, we've all had rough days.

12:04.743 --> 12:06.612
Why don't you let us finish
this delivery for you?

12:06.655 --> 12:08.608
Okay, but we've only got,
like, 10 minutes.

12:08.650 --> 12:09.670
Let's go, then! Come here.

12:09.712 --> 12:10.944
- Okay.
- Come on!

12:10.986 --> 12:13.492
It'll feel good to get
something right today.

12:13.534 --> 12:15.955
Plus, I wouldn't mind sticking
it to some preppy, white jerks.

12:15.997 --> 12:19.141
Hey! That life comes
with its own problems!

12:24.069 --> 12:25.299
Don't be mad, Dad.

12:25.341 --> 12:26.785
Gloria was just worried about you.

12:26.827 --> 12:28.145
I don't want to talk about it.

12:28.187 --> 12:29.928
Let's just have a drink and be quiet.

12:32.816 --> 12:35.194
Lot of colors in that fire, huh?

12:35.237 --> 12:37.572
Red, green...

12:37.615 --> 12:39.229
- yellow, blue...
- Geez. Okay.

12:39.271 --> 12:41.947
What is this yammering with you?!
Seriously!

12:41.990 --> 12:43.179
I don't know.

12:44.623 --> 12:47.596
I guess I just don't like being
alone with my own thoughts.

12:48.955 --> 12:50.993
Maybe it's because I have a
couple of grandkids on the way,

12:51.036 --> 12:52.650
but now, if... if things get too quiet,

12:52.692 --> 12:55.028
my mind goes to a dark place fast.

12:55.070 --> 12:57.534
I start to worry about
the people that I love

12:57.576 --> 12:59.403
and all the bad things
that could happen to them.

13:00.592 --> 13:03.607
I suppose talking...
pushes those thoughts out

13:03.650 --> 13:05.434
and helps me feel okay.

13:05.476 --> 13:06.877
I get it.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.364
We can all spiral.

13:08.406 --> 13:10.105
But you can't talk your way out of it.

13:10.148 --> 13:12.696
You got to think your way out of it.

13:12.738 --> 13:14.776
You know, find a happy place.

13:14.819 --> 13:16.306
Try this.

13:16.348 --> 13:18.514
30 seconds, no talking. Go.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.456
- Buddy, where are you?
- I'm back. Yep.

13:36.499 --> 13:38.537
You know, I think
we can learn a lot from this guy,

13:38.579 --> 13:39.726
because it's not the...

13:39.769 --> 13:42.741
the bears out there
that we're afraid of.

13:42.784 --> 13:43.931
It's the bears in our lives...

13:43.973 --> 13:46.352
the fear that keeps us up at night.

13:46.394 --> 13:49.240
And I think that's an interesting
topic we can return to

13:49.282 --> 13:51.661
once I change into my
"Fireside Chat" look.

13:51.703 --> 13:52.977
Another wardrobe change?

13:53.020 --> 13:55.270
You're like a sultan's
bride on her wedding day.

13:55.313 --> 13:57.182
Go ahead... make fun of me.

13:57.224 --> 13:58.625
I like my outfits.

13:58.668 --> 13:59.943
Why so many?

13:59.985 --> 14:01.344
Yeah, I guess when I was a kid,

14:01.386 --> 14:03.170
I realized I wasn't ever gonna fit in,

14:03.213 --> 14:05.038
so I decided to stand out.

14:05.081 --> 14:06.950
I embraced my flamboyance

14:06.992 --> 14:09.285
to let the world know their
insults won't hurt me.

14:09.328 --> 14:11.621
Want to make a joke about me?
Go ahead, 'cause I'm in on it.

14:12.981 --> 14:15.019
That's really beautiful, Cam.

14:15.061 --> 14:17.270
And you're not alone.

14:17.313 --> 14:20.583
Growing up, we were all
insecure nerds in our own way.

14:22.536 --> 14:23.981
I was cool.

14:26.656 --> 14:28.780
What? I thought we were sharing.

14:28.822 --> 14:31.456
That's very brave, Cam.
That's good stuff.

14:35.659 --> 14:37.571
Are you crazy?!
I shouldn't be the one driving!

14:37.613 --> 14:39.525
There is no time to argue!
Just go! Come on!

14:41.757 --> 14:43.704
Thanks so much for making
me part of your group.

14:43.746 --> 14:46.209
It's not every day you
make four new best friends.

14:47.868 --> 14:49.310
Why are they going so slow?!

14:49.352 --> 14:50.669
I can't get past them!

14:50.712 --> 14:52.453
This is one of Sigma's tactics.

14:52.496 --> 14:53.599
They track my location on the app

14:53.642 --> 14:55.426
and send pledges to try to slow me down.

14:55.468 --> 14:56.573
Ugh! What am I gonna do?!

14:57.030 --> 14:58.144
I'll handle this.

14:58.186 --> 15:00.182
Carl, I'm taking your paintball guns!

15:00.736 --> 15:03.326
Move! Or I move you!

15:07.784 --> 15:09.102
I do still have my edge!

15:09.144 --> 15:10.078
Yes!

15:11.395 --> 15:13.179
Will you join my paintball team?

15:14.452 --> 15:15.371
What is that?!

15:15.451 --> 15:17.213
Field of Minions. Classic Sigmas.

15:17.256 --> 15:19.379
Don't get distracted by the cuteness.
We only have five minutes.

15:19.421 --> 15:20.696
Just go around them.

15:26.221 --> 15:27.580
Oh, my God, I did it!

15:27.623 --> 15:28.855
And you're all still in the car!

15:28.897 --> 15:30.469
Okay, now, we can't give them
any reason to say

15:30.511 --> 15:31.572
that we didn't fill the order perfectly,

15:31.615 --> 15:33.186
so check the pizzas,
make sure they didn't shift.

15:33.229 --> 15:35.268
Oh, Haley, I'm sure
you're worrying about nothing...

15:35.712 --> 15:37.052
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

15:41.383 --> 15:43.124
Carl, do you have a pizza slicer?

15:43.167 --> 15:45.333
Only the commemorative one
I got for 10 years of service.

15:45.376 --> 15:46.947
Give it to me. I have a vision.

15:47.789 --> 15:50.005
Shaq and Hendrix never got
past their blind spots.

15:50.047 --> 15:51.959
Maybe they didn't want it enough.

15:52.001 --> 15:54.550
Turning 9 pizzas into
10 was a simple matter

15:54.584 --> 15:56.512
of removing one slice from each pie,

15:56.546 --> 15:58.159
then trimming off a
V-shaped portion of pizza

15:58.201 --> 15:59.773
from each of the remaining slices,

15:59.815 --> 16:01.684
turning them from 36-degree
angles to 40-degree angles,

16:01.727 --> 16:03.383
then putting together
the 40-degree angles

16:03.426 --> 16:05.252
into nine slightly smaller pies.

16:05.294 --> 16:07.630
After that, one had only to repurpose

16:07.673 --> 16:09.583
the nine previously removed slices

16:09.626 --> 16:10.560
into a 10th pie.

16:11.495 --> 16:13.364
And... 10!

16:13.406 --> 16:14.552
It worked!

16:14.595 --> 16:15.614
It really did.

16:15.657 --> 16:17.398
I do have a visual brain.

16:17.441 --> 16:18.248
That was your thing?

16:18.290 --> 16:20.498
I do not miss having
white-people problems.

16:21.711 --> 16:23.316
We're here! I did it!

16:23.350 --> 16:25.722
We only have a minute to get
the pizzas inside. Let's go!

16:25.765 --> 16:27.973
Oh, wait, wait, wait!
Uh, the frat has a video doorbell.

16:28.016 --> 16:30.182
If they see it's a delivery,
they try to run out the clock.

16:30.224 --> 16:32.220
I'll handle this.

16:33.877 --> 16:35.193
Stay on that side.

16:36.765 --> 16:37.869
Yeah?

16:37.911 --> 16:39.621
Hi. Um...

16:39.993 --> 16:42.753
I go to U of A, and I'm super drunk.

16:42.795 --> 16:45.684
Is there a place where I
can sober up for the night?

16:47.468 --> 16:50.440
At least my looks can still
get me into a frat house.

16:50.483 --> 16:51.502
Okay, guys, go, go!

16:52.479 --> 16:54.900
10 pizzas on time.

16:54.942 --> 16:55.792
Pay up!

16:55.834 --> 16:57.193
You guys with Carl?

16:57.236 --> 16:59.231
We are Carl.

17:01.483 --> 17:03.267
Come on, hurry up! A bet's a bet!

17:03.309 --> 17:05.560
I told you I could stand
on one leg longer than you!

17:05.602 --> 17:07.938
You're the only one
whose balance gets better

17:07.981 --> 17:09.722
after drinking a jug of whiskey.

17:09.763 --> 17:12.099
All right.
My follower is gonna love this!

17:12.143 --> 17:13.162
Everybody say "Cheese!"

17:13.204 --> 17:14.351
- Cheese.
- Yes.

17:14.393 --> 17:16.092
Okay, now,
that is how you build a brand.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.683
Well, I guess we should kill
the rest of this whiskey.

17:18.726 --> 17:19.999
But then we'll have nothing
to serve the murderers

17:20.041 --> 17:21.060
when they arrive.

17:21.104 --> 17:22.589
You know, you joke,

17:22.633 --> 17:25.393
but you have a certain
paranoia about you.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.497
What... What's behind that?

17:26.540 --> 17:27.473
Well...

17:27.517 --> 17:29.768
Ooh! Are we about to hear
about Mitchell's bear?

17:29.810 --> 17:32.019
Uh, okay. It... It's, um...

17:32.061 --> 17:33.888
I've never told anyone this, but, uh,

17:33.930 --> 17:36.351
a fortune teller once predicted

17:36.394 --> 17:38.687
that I would not live
to see my 46th winter.

17:38.729 --> 17:41.532
Was that that kook that used
to live next door to us?

17:41.574 --> 17:42.381
She's nuts.

17:42.424 --> 17:45.227
She told your mother she was
gonna win a Tony one day.

17:45.270 --> 17:47.605
But she was right about
a lot of other things.

17:47.648 --> 17:50.069
She said that I'd become a lawyer.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.532
She said that I would
marry a clown one day.

17:52.574 --> 17:54.401
Laughed a long time about that one.

17:54.443 --> 17:55.293
Why?

17:55.335 --> 17:57.416
Anyway, I-I guess my "bear"

17:57.458 --> 17:58.775
is the fear of dying young.

17:58.817 --> 18:01.239
Uh, I mean,
if that fortune teller's right,

18:01.280 --> 18:03.404
I only have three more years to live.

18:03.447 --> 18:05.061
Well, y-you know what? The way I see it,

18:05.103 --> 18:07.099
this little curse is actually a gift...

18:07.141 --> 18:09.945
a reason to live life to the fullest.

18:09.987 --> 18:11.644
And have no regrets.

18:11.686 --> 18:15.126
Okay, so we're all just accepting
this 46-year thing as true?

18:15.169 --> 18:16.698
We've made our peace with it.

18:16.740 --> 18:17.844
And so should you.

18:17.886 --> 18:20.605
Why not just live your limited days

18:20.647 --> 18:22.559
with leaving nothing unsaid?

18:22.601 --> 18:25.107
Tell the people who matter
the most how you feel.

18:25.150 --> 18:27.714
I tell you and Lily
I love you every single day.

18:27.804 --> 18:29.863
True. What about Phil?

18:29.906 --> 18:32.708
He did text me with a
"Love ya" this morning.

18:32.751 --> 18:33.685
Close enough.

18:33.728 --> 18:35.130
And your dad?

18:39.376 --> 18:40.438
Seriously?!

18:40.481 --> 18:42.307
I just have a hard time
saying that word to him.

18:42.350 --> 18:43.921
Which is fine for the both of us.

18:43.964 --> 18:45.068
Okay, well, it sounds like

18:45.110 --> 18:46.965
you might be uncomfortable
with that word, too.

18:47.031 --> 18:49.314
No! I don't have a problem with it.
I use it all the time.

18:49.357 --> 18:50.632
I'm always saying I love things. I...

18:50.674 --> 18:53.647
I love the feel of toasty
socks out of the microwave.

18:53.689 --> 18:56.493
I love the far-off sound
of a train whistle.

18:56.535 --> 18:59.338
You know, "Ooh!
What adventure have they gotten off to?"

18:59.380 --> 19:01.424
I l... I love watching a baby stretch.

19:01.466 --> 19:04.694
Those are all good things
in your life, Jay, but...

19:04.736 --> 19:06.053
what's your "bear"?

19:06.095 --> 19:06.817
I don't have one.

19:06.860 --> 19:08.388
Oh, come on! We all told you ours.

19:08.431 --> 19:10.427
Now, when you get to my age,

19:10.470 --> 19:13.272
there are less things
that you're afraid of.

19:13.315 --> 19:15.056
Except maybe...

19:15.099 --> 19:16.670
being a burden to your family.

19:17.308 --> 19:18.582
Which is starting already,

19:18.624 --> 19:21.385
because Gloria forced
you guys to babysit me,

19:21.427 --> 19:24.400
which is why I wanted
to spend the night here

19:24.443 --> 19:28.477
so I could prove I'm not some...
frail old man.

19:29.327 --> 19:30.600
But, if I'm being honest,

19:30.643 --> 19:34.211
that hike gets tougher
for me every year.

19:34.253 --> 19:37.566
And I was relieved that I
didn't have to do it alone.

19:37.608 --> 19:38.839
Oh, Dad.

19:38.882 --> 19:40.369
You could never be a burden.

19:40.412 --> 19:42.875
Yeah, you're the one who's
always taking care of all of us.

19:42.918 --> 19:45.720
We'd love the chance
to return the favor.

19:47.164 --> 19:48.820
All right. It's getting late.

19:48.863 --> 19:50.902
This mountain pimp
outfit's making me sweat.

19:50.944 --> 19:52.090
Let's... Let's get some rest.

19:53.261 --> 19:54.681
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:54.724 --> 19:56.422
I'll take the sofa.

19:56.465 --> 19:57.655
Sure you're gonna be okay out here?

19:57.697 --> 19:59.226
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- Okay.

20:01.137 --> 20:03.260
Do... Do you want me to grab you
an extra blanket or something?

20:03.303 --> 20:05.797
No, no. I'll get something if I need it.

20:05.894 --> 20:08.442
Okay. Well...

20:09.401 --> 20:10.830
Good night.

20:15.733 --> 20:17.093
I know.

20:33.951 --> 20:35.751
All right, Dad. We're ready to go.

20:35.786 --> 20:36.628
Yeah, Jay.

20:36.664 --> 20:39.240
I'm sorry you didn't see a
bald eagle this time around.

20:39.283 --> 20:40.893
Y-Yeah. It's too bad.

20:40.937 --> 20:43.331
I guess we'll all have to come
back here again next year.

20:43.374 --> 20:44.593
Yeah.

20:44.636 --> 20:46.377
I don't know about you guys,
but I slept great.

20:46.421 --> 20:49.380
That cot was so soft.
I'm not always a sound sleeper.

20:49.424 --> 20:52.340
Been meaning to try that melatonin.
I hear it's a real game-changer.

20:52.383 --> 20:54.124
And you can get it anywhere nowadays.

20:54.168 --> 20:55.473
Has it always been over-the-counter?

20:55.517 --> 20:57.345
Kind of a funny phrase, isn't it...
"over-the-counter"?
