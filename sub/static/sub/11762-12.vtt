WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:03.034
SO WHAT
ARE WE DOING TONIGHT?

00:03.034 --> 00:05.076
WHAT ARE WE DOING?
WE'RE DRINKING A BOTTLE OF WINE.

00:05.076 --> 00:08.079
I GOT ANOTHER ONE WAITING
FOR US IN THE ON-DECK CIRCLE.

00:08.079 --> 00:09.710
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.083
OH, THE STAY-AT-HOME-AND-DRINK
DATE.

00:12.083 --> 00:15.015
ALWAYS DANGEROUS. ALCOHOL MAKES
IT HARDER TO FILTER YOURSELF.
YOU'D MAKE A PRETTY GIRL.

00:15.015 --> 00:18.189
AND WE'RE OFF.
SERIOUSLY. I HAVE A SKIRT
THAT'S A LITTLE TOO BIG FOR ME,

00:18.189 --> 00:20.221
AND GOD KNOWS,
YOU'VE GOT THE LEGS.

00:20.221 --> 00:22.393
ALL WE GOTTA DO IS
SHAVE YOU DOWN,

00:22.393 --> 00:26.327
AND THEN TUCK SOME STUFF
BACK UP.
NO TUCKING.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.429
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
THEN WE WON'T HAVE FUN. MM.

00:28.429 --> 00:32.063
CAN WE AT LEAST HAVE
SOME SERIOUS SHARE TIME?
I'LL START OFF WITH A CLASSIC--

00:32.063 --> 00:34.535
HOW MANY PEOPLE
HAVE YOU SLEPT WITH?

00:34.535 --> 00:37.408
SIX. OH, WAIT. ARE WE COUNTING
PEOPLE THAT WE WISH WE HADN'T?

00:37.408 --> 00:41.072
YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, NINE AND A HALF.
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

00:41.072 --> 00:43.174
8...
REALLY?

00:43.174 --> 00:44.715
3. 83. 183.

00:44.715 --> 00:47.718
(chuckles) OOH.
MOST OF IT HAPPENED
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.720
UH, I WAS IN A BOY BAND
CALLED 'DA BOOTY CREW.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.153
"DON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST ME."
WELL...

00:52.153 --> 00:54.685
I'M NOT--I'M NOT SAYING THAT
TO YOU.

00:54.685 --> 00:56.827
THAT WAS THE NAME
OF OUR FIRST SINGLE--

00:56.827 --> 01:00.461
"GIRL, DON'T HOLD THAT
AGAINST ME."
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
THERE'S A LOT OF LYING

01:00.461 --> 01:03.594
GOING ON DURING SHARE TIME?
THERE IS. LET'S GO HAVE
NAKED SHARE TIME.

01:03.594 --> 01:05.136
OKAY.

01:05.136 --> 01:08.199
OH, DON'T HIT MY HEAD
ON THE RAILING AGAIN.
OKAY.

01:08.199 --> 01:10.241
EVENING, JEFF.
HEY, TRAVIS.

01:10.241 --> 01:12.143
SPIN ME AROUND.

01:12.143 --> 01:15.476
HEY, TRAVIS. JEFF PICKED ME UP
'CAUSE I SAW A SPIDER.

01:15.476 --> 01:17.478
THANKS FOR STILL CARING ENOUGH
TO LIE.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.180
MM.
GOOD NIGHT.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.112
MWAH. GOOD NIGHT. ONWARD.

01:21.112 --> 01:24.715
в™Є GIRL, DON'T HOLD THAT
AGAINST ME в™Є

01:24.715 --> 01:26.287
в™Є GIRL в™Є

01:26.287 --> 01:29.460
ANYWAY, SINCE I HAD SEX
WITH JEFF LAST NIGHT

01:29.460 --> 01:32.163
EVEN THOUGH I WAS TIRED,
HE WAS SO GRATEFUL

01:32.163 --> 01:35.166
THAT HE DROVE TO THAT NEW BAKERY
40 MINUTES AWAY

01:35.166 --> 01:38.829
AND GOT ME
THOSE HOMEMADE JELLY DOUGHNUTS.
(whispers) OH.

01:38.829 --> 01:42.233
THAT'S WEIRD, 'CAUSE ELLIE LOVES
THOSE VERY SAME DOUGHNUTS.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.575
YEAH.
DID ANY OF THAT
REALLY HAPPEN,

01:44.575 --> 01:46.877
OR DID ELLIE
JUST MAKE YOU SAY THAT?

01:46.877 --> 01:50.110
ALL RIGHT, ELLIE, I TRIED.
I DON'T KNOW.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.413
WHEN WE HAVE SEX,
I WANT THOSE DOUGHNUTS!

01:52.413 --> 01:55.115
NO. WHERE'S JEFF?
HE'LL BACK ME UP ON THIS.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.148
JEFF TOOK TRAVIS TO BOBBY'S.

01:57.148 --> 02:00.691
THEY'RE PLAYING
SOME SORT OF GAME.
I'M--I'M--I'M SORRY.
WAIT. WHAT'S HAPPENING?

02:00.691 --> 02:03.894
JUST GO.

02:03.894 --> 02:05.326
(coin clinks)

02:05.326 --> 02:08.128
OHH! IT'S GOOD!

02:08.128 --> 02:10.130
BOYS, THE PENNY-CAN GAME IS

02:10.130 --> 02:13.133
THE BEST THING I'VE EVER CREATED
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.535
AND THANK YOU, DAD.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.508
NOW IF THE PENNY GOES
IN THE CAN, YOU GET A POINT.

02:17.508 --> 02:20.211
IF IT DOESN'T, YOU DON'T.
IT'S VERY CHESS-LIKE.

02:20.211 --> 02:22.213
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
NOW, LADIES, WARM-UP'S OVER.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.144
ME AND TRAV VERSUS YOU.
(tires screech)

02:24.144 --> 02:26.146
THE FIRST TEAM
TO 1,000 POINTS WINS.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.350
ARE YOU GUYS PLAYING PENNY-CAN?
IS IT FINALLY REAL?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.422
IT IS, BABY. ALL RIGHT,
FIRST ROUND, RAPID-FIRE. ME.

02:31.422 --> 02:36.227
OOH! TRAV. JEFF. G-MAN.

02:36.227 --> 02:38.929
(clink)
(all) OH!

02:38.929 --> 02:40.431
WHOO-HOO!

02:42.493 --> 02:44.795
I FEEL A LITTLE WEIRD.

02:44.795 --> 02:48.269
WHY? BECAUSE YOU SPENT THE NIGHT
ON THE SECOND DATE?
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T TRY
TO HAVE SEX WITH ME.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.272
I MEAN, I GUESS IT'S NICE
TO WAKE UP WITH MY PANTIES ON.

02:51.272 --> 02:53.744
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO MAKE OF IT.

02:53.744 --> 02:56.607
(gasps) ARE YOU GAY?
IT'S OKAY IF YOU ARE.

02:56.607 --> 02:58.609
I HAVE TURNED A LOT
OF GAY DUDES STRAIGHT,

02:58.609 --> 03:01.952
ALTHOUGH THAT COULD JUST BE
A LINE THAT GUYS USE ON ME

03:01.952 --> 03:04.955
BECAUSE THEY KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE A CHALLENGE.
WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX,

03:04.955 --> 03:07.858
BUT I FEEL LIKE WE DID PLENTY
OF OTHER THINGS THAT SENT

03:07.858 --> 03:10.421
A VERY CLEAR HETEROSEXUAL
MESSAGE OUT TO THE WORLD.

03:10.421 --> 03:12.423
AND I SAY "THE WORLD,"
BECAUSE THE WALLS

03:12.423 --> 03:14.895
IN THIS APARTMENT COMPLEX
ARE CRAZY-THIN,

03:14.895 --> 03:17.828
AND YOU ARE SOMEWHAT VOCAL.
(woman) IT'S OKAY, SMITH.

03:17.828 --> 03:20.231
OH, THANKS, MRS. MENDELSON.
AND NICE TO MEET YOU, LAURIE.

03:20.231 --> 03:22.903
AW, YOU, TOO, HELEN.
SHE'S A COOL OLD BIRD.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.577
LAURIE, I DIDN'T TRY TO SLEEP
WITH YOU BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

03:26.577 --> 03:29.840
OKAY? BUT WE'VE ONLY BEEN
ON TWO DATES,

03:29.840 --> 03:31.842
AND I'M GOING BACK
TO LAW SCHOOL TOMORROW.

03:31.842 --> 03:34.845
IF I HAD SEX WITH YOU AND THEN
DISAPPEARED FOR THREE MONTHS,

03:34.845 --> 03:37.518
YOU'D NEVER GIVE ME A CHANCE
WHEN I GOT BACK,

03:37.518 --> 03:39.520
AND I WANT A CHANCE. OKAY?

03:39.520 --> 03:41.252
OKAY.

03:41.252 --> 03:43.894
(Helen) AW.

03:43.894 --> 03:47.698
OKAY, SHOULD WE SIT BOY, GIRL,
BOY, GIRL?
OH, STOP PRETENDING

03:47.698 --> 03:51.662
LIKE YOU'RE NOT JUST GONNA TALK
TO HER THE WHOLE NIGHT.
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:51.662 --> 03:53.334
(clears throat)

03:53.334 --> 03:55.836
OKAY, WOULD YOU ORDER SOME WINE?
AND I'LL HAVE A STEAK.

03:55.836 --> 03:58.439
AND YOU WANT SOME PASTA
SO I CAN HAVE SOME.

03:58.439 --> 04:00.441
SEE YOU IN ABOUT AN HOUR.
HOUR AND A HALF.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.343
GOOD NIGHT.
HAVE FUN, LADIES.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.715
OKAY, UM...

04:04.715 --> 04:06.847
I MISS PENNY-CAN.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.979
SCOTT, IF WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE THIS BABY,

04:08.979 --> 04:11.852
SOME THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE.
(clink)

04:11.852 --> 04:13.253
NICE SHOT.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.025
9-4, ME.

04:15.025 --> 04:18.028
ALL RIGHT,
THAT GUY'S COFFEE CUP.

04:18.028 --> 04:20.561
(Jules) OKAY,
TIME FOR GROUP TALK.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.993
LET'S DIVE IN.
SO YOU TWO IN LOVE?

04:22.993 --> 04:25.696
DIVE IN LESS.
OH, THAT'S WHY I MARRIED YOU.

04:25.696 --> 04:27.968
HE GETS A COUPLE DRINKS
IN HIM,

04:27.968 --> 04:31.942
AND HE STARTS DROPPING
THE QUESTION BOMBS.
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT
HAVING BABIES IN YOUR 40s?

04:31.942 --> 04:34.745
(makes exploding noise)
NO, SERIOUSLY.

04:34.745 --> 04:37.908
ARE YOU TWO EXCLUSIVE
OR ARE YOU SEEING OTHER PEOPLE?
(makes exploding noise)

04:37.908 --> 04:39.980
PLEASE STOP.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.982
NO, I'LL TAKE THIS ONE.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.714
UM, JULES IS INCREDIBLE,

04:43.714 --> 04:46.957
AND I DON'T WANT TO TO SEE OTHER
PEOPLE, BUT THAT'S JUST ME.

04:46.957 --> 04:49.420
YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK JULES
WHAT SHE THINKS.

04:49.420 --> 04:51.962
ELLIE, BOMB NOISE.
(makes exploding sound)

04:51.962 --> 04:54.795
THANK YOU. I'M GONNA GO ORDER US
ANOTHER BOTTLE OF WINE,

04:54.795 --> 04:57.728
BECAUSE I NEED TO DRINK MORE
IMMEDIATELY. AHEM. EXCUSE ME.

04:57.728 --> 05:01.031
SWEETIE, WE'RE GONNA GET DEEP,
SO GO TAKE A RESTAURANT WALK.

05:01.031 --> 05:03.834
OH. I LOVE
A GOOD RESTAURANT WALK.

05:03.834 --> 05:06.407
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.909
I-I-I REALLY LIKE JEFF,
AND I'M NOT DATING ANYONE ELSE.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.911
I MEAN,
NOT THAT I WOULD DATE TWO GUYS

05:10.911 --> 05:12.913
AT THE SAME TIME ANYWAY,
BECAUSE IN GRADE SCHOOL,

05:12.913 --> 05:15.916
THIS NUN TOLD ME IF I KISS
TWO BOYS IN THE SAME DAY,

05:15.916 --> 05:18.919
THEIR SPIT WOULD MIX IN MY MOUTH
AND IT WOULD KILL ME.
(whispers)
RELIGION IS FANTASTIC.

05:18.919 --> 05:22.322
STILL, I MEAN, BEING EXCLUSIVE--
THAT'S JUST SO SERIOUS.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.456
I DON'T THINK I'M READY FOR THAT
YET WITH ANYONE.

05:25.456 --> 05:27.998
THAT BOY IS IN DEMAND.
LOOK AT THOSE WOMEN.

05:27.998 --> 05:30.701
THEY'RE BREAKING OUT
THE CLASSIC FLIRT MOVES.

05:30.701 --> 05:31.962
OH, MY GOD.

05:31.962 --> 05:35.065
THERE'S
THE ACCIDENTAL-BUMP-AND-SMILE.

05:35.065 --> 05:38.068
(gasps) AND THERE'S THE OLD
OH-IT'S-SO-HOT-IN-HERE-

05:38.068 --> 05:40.070
I-HAVE-TO-DAB-ICE-
ON-MY-CLEAVAGE.

05:40.070 --> 05:42.072
OH, AND THEN JUST A BLATANT

05:42.072 --> 05:44.975
YOU-CAN-SMACK-MY-ASS-
IF-YOU-WANT-TO.

05:44.975 --> 05:46.817
WHO DOES THAT?

05:46.817 --> 05:48.118
JULES?

05:48.118 --> 05:49.720
THANK YOU.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.482
LET'S BE EXCLUSIVE.

05:51.482 --> 05:53.654
YOU SURE?

05:53.654 --> 05:54.925
I'M SURE.

05:57.758 --> 06:00.491
ATTAGIRL.

06:00.491 --> 06:02.463
в™Єв™Є

06:12.072 --> 06:14.605
в™Є GIRL,
DON'T HOLD THAT AGAINST ME в™Є

06:14.605 --> 06:16.947
в™Є GIRL в™Є
в™Є LITTLE PREGNANT GIRL в™Є

06:16.947 --> 06:20.581
WHAT? IN MY HEAD, THE SONG
IS ABOUT TEENAGE PREGNANCY.

06:20.581 --> 06:24.014
THAT'S A BIT OF A LEAP.
I WANT TO WRITE MUSIC
THAT MATTERS, JEFF.

06:24.014 --> 06:26.116
YOU KNOW WHY BRUNCH SATURDAY
KICKS ASS?

06:26.116 --> 06:29.019
IT'S GOT ORANGE JUICE
THAT CAN MAKE ME FEEL BUZZY.

06:29.019 --> 06:32.623
WE DON'T HAVE CHAMPAGNE.
IT'S BEER AND ORANGE JUICE,
BABY.

06:32.623 --> 06:34.024
THAT'S GROSS.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.969
OH! I NEED MORE ICE IN MINE.

06:38.969 --> 06:41.802
I'LL MAKE THEM.
(clears throat)

06:41.802 --> 06:44.435
AHH.
I LIKE THAT GUY. GREAT VOCALS.

06:44.435 --> 06:46.707
YEAH, AND THOSE SHOULDERS--

06:46.707 --> 06:48.909
HE'S DEFINITELY BUILT
A FEW SHEDS.
RIGHT?

06:48.909 --> 06:52.412
MM, HE'D LOOK GREAT
IN A SKIRT.
WHAT?

06:52.412 --> 06:54.445
WHAT? OH, I'M GLAD
YOU GUYS LIKE HIM,

06:54.445 --> 06:56.447
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY ARE
GETTING...

06:56.447 --> 06:58.048
KINDA SERIOUS.

06:58.048 --> 07:00.591
SO HE'S NOT JUST
DATE-OF-THE-WEEK GUY?

07:00.591 --> 07:02.953
HE'S FOR REAL?

07:02.953 --> 07:05.496
YEAH. HE IS. HMM.

07:05.496 --> 07:08.098
GREAT. THAT'S SO GOOD FOR YOU.
COOL. OH, GOOD.

07:08.098 --> 07:11.131
WHERE THE HELL ARE
ANDY AND ELLIE?

07:13.764 --> 07:17.007
OH. SEE? NOW LETTING YOU CLIMB
ALL OVER ME THIS MORNING

07:17.007 --> 07:19.510
WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT.

07:19.510 --> 07:24.044
I GOT TWO, IN CASE TONIGHT
WE WANNA--
(mouth full) THAT'S NOT
HOW THAT WORKS. MNH-MNH.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.116
MMM!

07:26.116 --> 07:28.949
WELL, I'M LEAVING, SO I GUESS
THIS IS, UH, GOOD-BYE.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.151
NO, NO, NO. NO GOOD-BYES.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.754
GOOD-BYES PUT ME
IN A VERY DESTRUCTIVE PLACE.

07:33.754 --> 07:36.086
BUT MY PLANE LEAVES
IN AN HOUR, SO...

07:36.086 --> 07:39.089
YES, AND I'M GOING TO PRETEND
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

07:39.089 --> 07:42.092
THAT WAY I DON'T HAVE
TO GET ALL VIOLENT

07:42.092 --> 07:45.165
AND SPEND THE DAY KICKING STUFF.
MAYBE I'LL JUST KISS YOU
AND SPLIT.

07:45.165 --> 07:46.997
THAT'S A BETTER IDEA.

07:56.647 --> 07:59.049
DO YOU THINK
THAT'S IT'S WEIRD OR SEXY

07:59.049 --> 08:01.111
TO KISS WITH YOUR EYES OPEN?

08:04.084 --> 08:07.518
WELL, IT'S SO WEIRD I MAY
NEVER WANT TO KISS AGAIN.

08:07.518 --> 08:09.990
HERE, LET ME FIX IT. MM.
MM.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.892
MM. THAT'S BETTER.

08:11.892 --> 08:14.895
I GOTTA GET GOING.
ME, TOO.
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.898
BOBBY, NO, WAIT. DON'T GO.
SERIOUSLY, WANT HIM MORE.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.801
I CAN'T.
WHY ARE THOSE TWO SO MOPEY?

08:20.801 --> 08:23.233
YOU KNOW THAT SECRET I'VE BEEN
KEEPING SINCE THANKSGIVING?

08:23.233 --> 08:25.976
WELL, I'M SICK OF THE HEARTBURN
AND THE STRESS,

08:25.976 --> 08:28.238
SO I'M JUST GONNA LET IT OUT.
OKAY.

08:28.238 --> 08:31.942
BOBBY AND GRAYSON ARE BOTH
KIND OF INTERESTED IN JULES.

08:31.942 --> 08:35.085
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME
THAT THE OVERLY FLIRTY NEIGHBOR

08:35.085 --> 08:39.249
AND THE EX-HUSBAND WHO IS NEVER
NOT HERE BOTH LIKE JULES?

08:39.249 --> 08:41.792
THAT IS A REVELATION!

08:41.792 --> 08:44.955
YOU DONE?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

08:44.955 --> 08:47.628
I'M A--I'M A LITTLE DIZZY.
I'M FLABBERGASTED!

08:47.628 --> 08:51.061
I--OH, OH. WHAT?
I-I HAVE TO SIT.

08:51.061 --> 08:54.064
I KNEW JULES WOULD EVENTUALLY
DATE SOMEONE SHE CARED ABOUT.

08:54.064 --> 08:56.607
I JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT'D BE SO SOON.

08:56.607 --> 08:59.810
IT FEELS WEIRD FOR US
TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS.
GOOD WEIRD?

08:59.810 --> 09:02.012
THAT'S, UH,
NOT ACTUALLY A PHRASE.

09:02.012 --> 09:06.146
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME YOU WERE
IN A REAL RELATIONSHIP?
WITH MY WIFE.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.948
YEAH, ME, TOO.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.951
REMEMBER HOW GREAT IT IS
WHEN IT'S FIRST STARTING OUT

09:10.951 --> 09:13.253
AND YOU'RE JUST LIKE
A COUPLE OF STUPID KIDS,

09:13.253 --> 09:15.285
JUST LAUGHING AT EVERYTHING?
YOU LOOK ADORABLE.

09:15.285 --> 09:18.328
I FEEL PRETTY SEXY.
BYE, MOM.

09:18.328 --> 09:20.891
C--HE PROBABLY DIDN'T--
(Travis) I NOTICED.

09:20.891 --> 09:22.132
(sighs)

09:22.132 --> 09:25.165
WELL, NOW THAT IT'S OUT,
LET'S GO SHAVE YOU.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.167
NO, AND STOP ASKING.
(Bobby) AND YOU JUST WANT

09:27.167 --> 09:29.600
TO SHOW THAT PERSON OFF
TO EVERYONE.
BARB.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.802
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:31.802 --> 09:34.645
I'VE ALREADY DONE SIX THINGS
TO IT IN MY HEAD.

09:34.645 --> 09:36.176
MAY I TOUCH IT?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.148
ALL RIGHT, SHOW'S OVER.
(mouths word)

09:39.810 --> 09:40.811
UGH!

09:40.811 --> 09:42.883
NICE BAR. DON'T KICK.

09:42.883 --> 09:45.886
SMITH'S SUCH AN ASS. I CAN'T
BELIEVE THAT HE DUMPED ME.

09:45.886 --> 09:48.088
AND I WOULD HAVE ALREADY
STARTED MY HEALING RITUAL,

09:48.088 --> 09:50.090
BUT THE HARDWARE STORE'S CLOSED,

09:50.090 --> 09:52.092
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANY SPRAY PAINT,

09:52.092 --> 09:55.095
SO I GUESS MAYBE I'M JUST
GONNA HAVE TO JUMP AHEAD

09:55.095 --> 09:58.829
TO SLEEPING
WITH ONE OF HIS FRIENDS.
WOW. SOLID PLAN,
BUT THERE IS ONE FLAW.

09:58.829 --> 10:02.102
YOU CAN GET SPRAY PAINT
AT THE DRUGSTORE.
DON'T PARTICIPATE.
SMITH DIDN'T DUMP YOU.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.105
HE JUST WENT BACK TO SCHOOL.
HE'S GONE, OKAY,
AND I FEEL LIKE CRAP.

10:05.105 --> 10:07.107
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CRAZY.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.040
IF SOMEBODY HURTS ME,
THEY HAVE TO PAY.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.083
OKAY. (chuckles)
UH, COME HERE.

10:13.083 --> 10:16.086
HUH? IF YOU'RE WITH
THE CRAZY GIRL, RING THE BELL.
(bell clangs)

10:16.086 --> 10:18.088
UH, LOOK, YOU NEED
TO BE DISTRACTED, RIGHT?

10:18.088 --> 10:22.022
SO BOBBY AND I NEED TO TALK.
YOU'RE GONNA BARTEND.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.154
(laughs) COME ON, GIRL.

10:24.154 --> 10:28.799
LOOK, IT'S JUST POURING LIQUID
INTO CUPS. YOU'LL BE FINE.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.931
DID HE JUST STEAL THAT?

10:30.931 --> 10:34.064
YEAH,
THAT'S SORTA HIS THING--

10:34.064 --> 10:36.106
STEALING...

10:36.106 --> 10:38.008
FROM ME.

10:38.008 --> 10:41.171
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I WILL, UH,
I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
OKAY, BE HERE AT 8:00.

10:41.171 --> 10:42.873
(makes kissing noises)

10:42.873 --> 10:44.845
WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT NOISE?

10:44.845 --> 10:47.978
IT'S LIKE I'M CALLING OVER
A HORSE OR SOMETHING.
CALM DOWN.

10:47.978 --> 10:51.281
YOU CALM DOWN. I AM ACTING WAY
TOO OVEREAGER WITH THIS GUY.

10:51.281 --> 10:53.283
NOW YOU NEED TO SAY SOMETHING
RIGHT NOW

10:53.283 --> 10:57.087
THAT HELPS ME STOP SPINNING.
THOSE JEANS REALLY WORK.

10:57.087 --> 10:59.189
THEY'RE NEW. (gasps) MM.
(singsongy) NICELY PLAYED.

10:59.189 --> 11:01.832
(normal voice) OKAY,
I'M COOKING HIM DINNER TONIGHT.

11:01.832 --> 11:04.094
WHAT SHOULD I MAKE?
WHO CARES?

11:04.094 --> 11:06.396
THE FIRST MEAL YOU MAKE SOMEONE
MAKES A STATEMENT.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.800
IF YOU HALF-ASS IT, IT'S LIKE
SAYING YOU DON'T CARE.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.803
BUT IF YOU MAKE IT TOO FANCY,
THEN IT'S LIKE SAYING,

11:12.803 --> 11:15.445
"STAY WITH ME
AND I'LL COOK AND CLEAN

11:15.445 --> 11:18.178
AND SERVICE YOU WHENEVER
YOU SNAP YOUR FINGERS."
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT, ANDY,
FOR JULES TO BE

11:18.178 --> 11:20.450
SOME SORT OF SLAVE-WHORE?
NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT
FOR JULES.

11:20.450 --> 11:22.713
(makes kissing noises)
DID YOU JUST DO THAT AGAIN?

11:22.713 --> 11:25.085
YEAH. I THINK I MIGHT LIKE IT.
IT'S NOT GOOD.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.917
(makes kissing noises)
STOP IT.

11:26.917 --> 11:28.358
WH-WHY YOU LEAVING?

11:28.358 --> 11:31.962
UGH. I'M BORED OF GIVING OUT
FREE DRINKS.

11:31.962 --> 11:33.393
YOU DIDN'T CHARGE PEOPLE?

11:33.393 --> 11:35.926
NO. YOU GET BETTER TIPS
THAT WAY.

11:35.926 --> 11:39.169
BESIDES, THAT BOY OVER THERE
IS A FRIEND OF SMITH'S.

11:39.169 --> 11:40.731
HIS NAME IS DOUG.

11:40.731 --> 11:42.733
WAVE, DOUG!

11:42.733 --> 11:45.836
OH. I LIKE
THAT HE DOES WHAT I SAY.

11:45.836 --> 11:47.838
I'M GOING TO THE BEACH CLUB.

11:47.838 --> 11:49.109
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THIS.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.813
THANKS FOR TRYING...
(whispers) BUT I DO.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.815
(normal voice) DOUG, COME ON.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.446
WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

11:56.446 --> 11:59.920
GO TO THE BEACH CLUB AND STOP
LAURIE FROM HAVING REVENGE SEX.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.922
I... DON'T REALLY WANT
TO DO THAT.

12:01.922 --> 12:04.755
COME ON, T-BONE.
TAKE MY RIDE.

12:04.755 --> 12:07.928
YOU KNOW, PUTTING GOLF CART KEYS
ON A FERRARI KEYCHAIN

12:07.928 --> 12:10.160
DOESN'T MAKE IT A FERRARI.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.232
I WAS BEING IRONIC.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.004
FIRST TIME.

12:14.004 --> 12:16.436
WHAT IN THE HELL IS
LAURIE THINKING?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.238
WOMEN CAN BE NUTTY.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.740
BUT IT'S USUALLY A GUY
THAT GETS THEM THERE.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.243
I MEAN, JULES HAS
MAJOR LEAGUE TRUST ISSUES.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.015
THAT PROBABLY FALLS ON ME.

12:25.015 --> 12:28.078
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY
TIMES I LEFT HER SITTING

12:28.078 --> 12:31.521
AT HOME ALONE,
WAITING FOR ME TO SHOW UP.

12:31.521 --> 12:33.153
BUT I JUST DIDN'T.

12:33.153 --> 12:36.787
I HOPE THAT NEVER HAPPENS
TO HER AGAIN.

12:36.787 --> 12:38.758
SHE DOESN'T DESERVE IT.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.168
HEY.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.470
HEY?

12:50.470 --> 12:53.443
THAT'S THE WEAK CRAP
YOU'RE BRINGING IN HERE?

12:53.443 --> 12:56.146
HEY? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

12:56.146 --> 12:59.850
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE LEARNED
FROM SCREWING UP SO MUCH?

12:59.850 --> 13:02.853
IF YOUR LADY'S MAD,
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHY,

13:02.853 --> 13:05.816
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
TO SAY...

13:05.816 --> 13:08.288
I'M SO SORRY.
WHAT CAN I DO TO FIX THIS?

13:08.288 --> 13:10.991
CAN YOU EVEN TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE APOLOGIZING, HMM?

13:10.991 --> 13:14.064
YOU CAN'T, CAN YA?
BECAUSE YOU ARE SELFISH.

13:14.064 --> 13:17.367
YOU'RE SELFISH. I HAVE SPENT ALL
DAY COOKING THIS FOOD FOR YOU.

13:17.367 --> 13:20.430
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA
SAY, "WELL, IT HASN'T BEEN

13:20.430 --> 13:22.432
ALL DAY BECAUSE I WAS WITH YOU
UNTIL 4:00."

13:22.432 --> 13:25.435
BUT DON'T YOU SAY IT. NO, NO,
DON'T YOU DARE SAY IT,

13:25.435 --> 13:28.438
BECAUSE I WILL SERIOUSLY SMACK
YOU RIGHT THERE IN THE MIDDLE

13:28.438 --> 13:31.211
OF YOUR BIG, BEAUTIFUL LIPS
THAT YOU'RE SO DAMN PROUD OF.

13:31.211 --> 13:34.214
YOU KNOW WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME
ABOUT YOU BEING LATE?

13:34.214 --> 13:37.217
YOU THINK THAT YOUR TIME IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN MY TIME.

13:37.217 --> 13:39.819
BUT GUESS WHAT, BUDDY?
THIS IS MY TIME,

13:39.819 --> 13:42.252
AND IT'LL BE A LONG TIME
BEFORE YOU FIND ME

13:42.252 --> 13:44.254
SITTING AROUND
LIKE SOME CHUMP,

13:44.254 --> 13:47.557
WAITING FOR A MAN TO COME IN
AND GRACE ME WITH HIS PRESENCE.

13:47.557 --> 13:49.960
YOU TOLD ME
TO BE HERE AT 8:00.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.331
IT'S... 8:11.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.833
WELL, OUR CLOCKS ARE
A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.267
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOURS SAYS 8:09.

13:57.267 --> 14:01.841
WELL, THE FOOD
IS NOT EVEN HOT ANYMORE.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.044
(whispers) YES, IT IS.
COULDN'T BE HOTTER.

14:04.044 --> 14:05.145
OOH!

14:05.145 --> 14:07.417
PUT SOME ICE ON THAT.
AAH!

14:09.179 --> 14:13.183
HOW IS IT THAT I'M ALREADY
ACTING LIKE A CRAZY PERSON?

14:13.183 --> 14:15.085
(Bobby) AND THEN BINGO...

14:15.085 --> 14:17.087
YOU GOT A TINY LEAK
IN THE DAM

14:17.087 --> 14:19.089
AND YOU GOTTA PLUG IT UP
REAL QUICK,

14:19.089 --> 14:21.531
OR YOU'LL BE IN A CAR
WITH NO BRAKES,

14:21.531 --> 14:26.036
DRIVING DOWN TROUBLE HIGHWAY.
WHAT? IS THE HIGHWAY FLOODED?
AND--AND WHERE'S THIS DAM?

14:26.036 --> 14:29.169
Y-YOU ARE MIXING METAPHORS
LIKE A CRAZY PERSON.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.042
(laughs) MY MOM SAYS
I'M COLORFUL.

14:32.042 --> 14:34.044
STILL,
I GET WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

14:34.044 --> 14:35.345
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE SO FRAGILE.

14:35.345 --> 14:38.348
WHEN I WAS MARRIED TO VIVIAN
AND A PROBLEM POPPED UP,

14:38.348 --> 14:40.310
I WOULD ALWAYS TELL MYSELF,

14:40.310 --> 14:42.552
IF WE JUST IGNORED IT,
IT'D GO AWAY. IT NEVER DID.

14:42.552 --> 14:45.185
WOULD IT BE OKAY
IF WE DIDN'T TALK ABOUT THIS

14:45.185 --> 14:48.188
AND YOU JUST TOOK ME UPSTAIRS
AND HELD FOR ME A LITTLE?

14:48.188 --> 14:49.489
SURE.
(ice clinks)

14:49.489 --> 14:52.162
YOU, UH, WANT YOUR USUAL RIDE?

14:54.524 --> 14:56.626
OH, GOD.

14:56.626 --> 14:58.368
(thud)
OW!

14:58.368 --> 15:00.370
SORRY.
SAME SPOT EVERY TIME.

15:00.370 --> 15:03.273
(clears throat)

15:03.273 --> 15:05.305
YEAH, I'M GONNA NEED
A FEW GIANT DRINKS

15:05.305 --> 15:07.307
BEFORE YOU START
ANY GROPE-Y STUFF.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.309
AND B.T.W., IF I EVER
DO SEE SMITH AGAIN,

15:09.309 --> 15:12.382
I'LL BE SURE TO TELL HIM
WHAT AN AWESOME FRIEND YOU ARE.

15:12.382 --> 15:14.084
UGH.
(tires screech)

15:14.084 --> 15:16.216
LAURIE, GET IN THE CART.

15:16.216 --> 15:18.148
YEAH, OKAY.
(mouths word)

15:18.148 --> 15:19.649
SORRY, DUDE.

15:19.649 --> 15:23.253
OH. HIT IT.
(tires peal)

15:23.253 --> 15:25.555
(mouth full) WHAT,
WERE YOU REALLY GONNA HOOK UP

15:25.555 --> 15:27.257
WITH THAT GUY?

15:27.257 --> 15:30.260
I DON'T KNOW. PROBABLY.
I'M JUST SO ANGRY.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.262
I DON'T WANT TO BELITTLE
YOUR PROBLEM,

15:32.262 --> 15:35.135
BUT ARE THERE REALLY WOMEN OUT
THERE WHO WILL HAVE SEX WITH ME

15:35.135 --> 15:38.168
JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE MAD
ABOUT SOMETHING?
(laughs) OH, YEAH, FOR SURE.

15:38.168 --> 15:40.210
THIS IS VERY EXCITING NEWS.

15:40.210 --> 15:42.672
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE ALSO GIRLS
THAT'LL SLEEP WITH YOU

15:42.672 --> 15:45.175
JUST BECAUSE THEIR FRIENDS ARE
PRETTIER THAN THEY ARE.

15:45.175 --> 15:48.018
HA! IT JUST KEEPS
GETTING BETTER.

15:48.018 --> 15:50.220
(laughs) HEY.

15:50.220 --> 15:51.421
HMM?

15:51.421 --> 15:53.423
THANK YOU FOR RESCUING ME.

15:53.423 --> 15:56.126
GRAYSON TOLD ME TO.

15:56.126 --> 15:57.257
REALLY?

15:57.257 --> 15:59.259
YEAH. SO THERE'S
A GROUP OF GIRLS,

15:59.259 --> 16:01.331
AND ONE OF THEM'S GOT
A GREAT BODY,

16:01.331 --> 16:05.965
BUT, LIKE, A LAZY EYE
OR SOMETHING...
OH, MY GOSH, YES.
EASY PICKINS'.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.402
OH, GOD.
OH, GOD. WOW. OH, I'M SO SORRY.

16:12.402 --> 16:14.404
I THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE
A ROMANTIC WAY

16:14.404 --> 16:17.177
FOR YOU TO WAKE UP,
BUT INSTEAD, I'VE TERRIFIED YOU.

16:17.177 --> 16:20.180
WELL, THAT WAS A WASTE
OF 40 MINUTES.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

16:20.180 --> 16:23.453
JEFF, I'VE BEEN OBSESSING
ALL NIGHT ABOUT MY FREAK-OUT.

16:23.453 --> 16:26.456
DO YOU EVER GET THE FEELING
LIKE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

16:26.456 --> 16:29.189
FOR FIVE YEARS,
BUT NOT IN A GOOD WAY?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.191
THIS IS TOO MUCH TO PROCESS

16:31.191 --> 16:33.363
TWO SECONDS
AFTER REGAINING CONSCIOUSNESS.

16:33.363 --> 16:38.198
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. (groans)
ARE YOU NAKED EXCEPT
FOR BLACK SOCKS?

16:38.198 --> 16:41.231
MY FEET GET COLD.
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

16:41.231 --> 16:44.304
WE'RE TOO COMFORTABLE.
I MEAN, THAT LOOKS RIDICULOUS.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.006
DOES THIS LOOK RIDICULOUS?
(grunts)

16:47.006 --> 16:49.309
STOP. I'M SERIOUS.

16:49.309 --> 16:51.311
YOU KNOW, WE--WE SHOULD STILL BE
IN THAT HONEYMOON PHASE

16:51.311 --> 16:55.215
WHERE YOU DON'T EVEN GLANCE AT
THE TV WHEN I'M TALKING TO YOU

16:55.215 --> 16:58.218
AND I STILL PRETEND THAT
I NEVER GO TO THE BATHROOM

16:58.218 --> 17:00.590
EXCEPT FOR TO PEE,
WHICH IS TRUE. I ONLY PEE.

17:00.590 --> 17:02.752
MAYBE THIS IS A GOOD THING.
RIGHT?

17:02.752 --> 17:06.126
I MEAN... WE'RE BEING REAL.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.028
I DON'T KNOW.

17:09.028 --> 17:11.161
MAYBE.

17:11.161 --> 17:14.404
HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE
HOW I MADE PENNY-CAN

17:14.404 --> 17:16.636
A LITTLE LESS FRUSTRATING?
HIT ME.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.268
BEHOLD.

17:18.268 --> 17:20.240
(coin clinks)

17:20.240 --> 17:22.342
IT'S GOOD!

17:22.342 --> 17:25.775
THIS MORNING I LOOKED AT SOME
OLD PICTURES OF VIVIAN AND ME

17:25.775 --> 17:29.349
FROM BACK WHEN WE WERE HAPPY.
THAT SOUNDS HEALTHY.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.281
(coin clinks)
GOT IT!

17:31.281 --> 17:34.454
SOMETIMES I STILL TRY AND FIGURE
OUT WHY IT FELL APART.

17:34.454 --> 17:37.487
YOU KNOW, I GUESS
THE SIMPLEST REASON IS

17:37.487 --> 17:41.831
THAT WE JUST WANTED
DIFFERENT THINGS.
I JUST DON'T THINK I'M READY
FOR ALL THIS YET.

17:41.831 --> 17:44.364
YEAH. I'VE ONLY BEEN DIVORCED
FOR EIGHT MONTHS,

17:44.364 --> 17:46.596
AND I-I'M FEELING VULNERABLE
AND TRAPPED AND...

17:46.596 --> 17:50.470
WOW. I DO NOT LIKE THE WAY
I'M BEHAVING.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.172
WE CAN FIX THIS.

17:52.172 --> 17:55.175
BUT WE JUST NEED TO SLOW DOWN
AND--AND GO BACK TO BEING CASUAL

17:55.175 --> 17:56.476
AND HAVING FUN.

17:56.476 --> 17:57.847
OKAY?

17:57.847 --> 18:00.580
NO.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.583
I DON'T WANT THAT.
WELL, THEN I TAKE IT ALL BACK.

18:03.583 --> 18:07.657
(laughs) JULES.
NO, NO. I JUST DON'T THINK
THAT YOU UNDERSTAND

18:07.657 --> 18:10.660
WHERE I'M AT IN MY LIFE
RIGHT NOW.
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU'RE AT.

18:10.660 --> 18:12.362
YOU'RE ENJOYING
YOUR INDEPENDENCE.

18:12.362 --> 18:14.364
YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
FOR COMMITMENT.

18:14.364 --> 18:17.627
AW, COME ON. I'VE BEEN THERE
FOR YEARS MYSELF.

18:17.627 --> 18:20.300
I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE
ANYMORE.

18:20.300 --> 18:22.302
(Matt Hires) в™Є MAYBE I'M BLIND,
MAYBE I'M BLIND в™Є

18:22.302 --> 18:24.304
в™Є OH, I COULDN'T SEE YOU SHINE в™Є

18:24.304 --> 18:26.506
WOW. THAT SUCKS.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.838
YEAH, IT DOES.

18:28.838 --> 18:32.882
в™Є FRONT OF MY EYES, OH, NO в™Є

18:32.882 --> 18:35.885
BEING IN A RELATIONSHIP
IS NEVER LIKE IN THE MOVIES,

18:35.885 --> 18:38.388
YOU KNOW, WHERE THERE'S
A BIG, DRAMATIC GOOD-BYE SPEECH,

18:38.388 --> 18:41.391
AND SOMEBODY'S LOOKING OUT
OF THE BACK WINDOW OF THE CAB

18:41.391 --> 18:43.523
AS THE MUSIC SWELLS?

18:43.523 --> 18:44.724
MM-HMM.

18:44.724 --> 18:48.658
AT LEAST, THAT'S NOT THE WAY
IT WAS FOR ME.

18:48.658 --> 18:50.660
(Grayson) NO, IN REAL LIFE,

18:50.660 --> 18:52.662
THE VERY END IS
MORE LIKE A FIZZLE.

18:52.662 --> 18:54.604
SO, UH...

18:54.604 --> 18:56.606
I GUESS I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

18:56.606 --> 18:59.709
I HOPE I SEE YOU AROUND.

18:59.709 --> 19:01.271
ME, TOO.

19:01.271 --> 19:04.614
в™Єв™Є

19:04.614 --> 19:06.316
BYE, JULES.

19:06.316 --> 19:09.719
в™Є OPEN YOUR MIND AND KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE в™Є

19:09.719 --> 19:11.351
BYE.

19:11.351 --> 19:14.184
в™Є SO PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME,
DON'T LEAVE ME OUTSIDE в™Є

19:14.184 --> 19:17.187
в™Є LEAVE ME OUTSIDE, OH, NO в™Є

19:18.788 --> 19:21.331
в™Є OH, AND, HONEY, I'VE TRIED в™Є

19:21.331 --> 19:23.363
HEY.

19:23.363 --> 19:26.336
I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR
LOOKING OUT FOR ME YESTERDAY.

19:26.336 --> 19:29.339
I STILL FEEL CRAPPY,
BUT IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE I--

19:29.339 --> 19:31.301
I JUST SPENT
THE LAST 24 HOURS

19:31.301 --> 19:33.303
REHASHING THE DISSOLUTION
OF MY MARRIAGE,

19:33.303 --> 19:37.207
SO IF IT'S OKAY, I'M ALL OUT
OF RELATIONSHIP TALK.

19:37.207 --> 19:40.210
OF COURSE. YEAH. NO, I JUST
WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU.

19:40.210 --> 19:41.611
SO...

19:41.611 --> 19:43.383
I DIDN'T SAY "LEAVE."

19:43.383 --> 19:47.617
в™Є RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY THIS TIME в™Є

19:47.617 --> 19:48.618
UGH.

19:48.618 --> 19:50.620
COULD I GET A BEER?
YES, YOU CAN.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.762
FOR FREE? (laughs)

19:52.762 --> 19:54.794
в™Є 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL I WANT NOW в™Є

19:54.794 --> 19:57.797
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYONE?
NO, NO, NO, NO. STOP.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.270
I DON'T WANT TO KNOW
ANOTHER SECRET EVER AGAIN.

20:00.270 --> 20:03.433
THEY GIVE ME AGITA SO BAD.
SO BAD.

20:03.433 --> 20:06.376
AND THEN WHEN I FINALLY
TELL THEM, HA, GUESS WHAT.

20:06.376 --> 20:08.478
NOBODY CARES.

20:08.478 --> 20:11.241
SO I AM GOING TO TAKE STAN
FOR A WALK.

20:11.241 --> 20:12.782
BUT IT'S MIDNIGHT.

20:12.782 --> 20:14.384
AGITA, JULES! AGITA.

20:14.384 --> 20:16.986
IT'S LIKE A VOLCANO
IN MY CHEST.

20:16.986 --> 20:19.649
OKAY, DUMMY'S GONE.
GO AHEAD, SWEETIE.

20:19.649 --> 20:22.292
WHAT IF I'M SOMEONE WHO
DOESN'T GET TO END UP HAPPY?

20:22.292 --> 20:25.855
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?
WHAT, THAT I'M ONLY GONNA BE
HAPPY IF WE MURDER ANDY

20:25.855 --> 20:28.628
AND YOU AND I GET MARRIED?
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

20:28.628 --> 20:30.600
RIGHT?
BUT NO.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.602
I THINK
IF JEFF WAS THE RIGHT GUY,

20:32.602 --> 20:36.366
YOU WOULD NEVER LET HIM LEAVE.
WELL, WHAT IF THERE IS
NO RIGHT GUY?

20:36.366 --> 20:37.837
THERE IS.

20:37.837 --> 20:40.710
(Ellie) AND YOU NEVER KNOW,

20:40.710 --> 20:44.414
HE COULD BE
RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.

20:44.414 --> 20:48.778
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

20:48.778 --> 20:50.420
COME ON!

20:50.420 --> 20:52.782
(belches) OH.

20:58.828 --> 21:00.830
WHAT SHOULD WE DO TODAY?

21:00.830 --> 21:02.932
I DON'T KNOW.
WE COULD READ MAGAZINES

21:02.932 --> 21:04.964
OR LOOK AT SHOES ONLINE,

21:04.964 --> 21:06.536
JUST GOSSIP.

21:06.536 --> 21:09.699
YOU KNOW, WE BOTH ONLY LIKE SEX
DURING THAT SMALL WINDOW

21:09.699 --> 21:11.671
BETWEEN 3:00 AND 3:45.
MM-HMM.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.404
SHOULD WE DO THAT?
EH.

21:14.404 --> 21:16.906
TODAY LET'S JUST KISS WITHOUT IT
HAVING TO LEAD ANYWHERE.

21:16.906 --> 21:19.379
OH, GOD.
I LOVE BEING MARRIED TO YOU.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.381
I KNOW.
I'M SO GLAD WE KILLED ANDY

21:21.381 --> 21:23.883
AND BURIED HIM IN THE BACKYARD.
OH, BABY.

21:23.883 --> 21:25.455
OH. OH.
OH.

21:25.455 --> 21:26.756
(grunts)

21:26.756 --> 21:28.958
AAH!
AAH!

21:28.958 --> 21:33.323
DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD
GET AWAY WITH IT? DID YA?
(Jules and Ellie scream)

21:33.323 --> 21:36.796
(gasps)
OH, YOU RUIN EVERYTHING!

21:36.796 --> 21:38.398
OH!
