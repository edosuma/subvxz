00:19.120 --> 00:21.441
(murmuring)

00:23.240 --> 00:25.322

00:26.880 --> 00:30.851
Narrator: This was the Open
when everything seemed to happen.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.082
(upbeat music)

00:35.120 --> 00:37.930
(fire crackling)

00:46.160 --> 00:50.484
On the second day,
the boy Ballesteros was now six under par.

00:50.640 --> 00:53.007
And led outright by two strokes.

00:54.560 --> 00:56.642
(crowd applauding)

00:58.640 --> 01:03.521
But, inevitably, the power of world golf
had begun to close in.

01:03.680 --> 01:05.330
Gary Player.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.084
Johnny Miller.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.765
Jack Nicklaus.

01:10.840 --> 01:14.811
Severiano Ballesteros,
only nineteen.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.970
(crowd applauding)

01:18.120 --> 01:19.531
Everyone enjoying him

01:19.720 --> 01:23.122
and waiting for him to vanish
from the leaderboard.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.009
I remember watching this 'boy'.

01:27.160 --> 01:32.200
I watched the way that he did things
and it was a little bit unique.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.370
(crowd applauding)

01:34.520 --> 01:37.285
Here was this young guy
ﬂashing a ball,

01:37.440 --> 01:40.205
playing great recoveries
and holing the putts

01:40.360 --> 01:44.524
<i>and</i> a <i>great smile and I said:
"This is</i> a <i>very special young man."</i>

01:45.640 --> 01:50.680
We all thought, who the devil
is this young matador of the links?

01:50.880 --> 01:52.882
Broadcaster: Straight in the middle.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.886
Peter Alliss: And of course his story was
quite extraordinary.

01:57.040 --> 01:59.122
(crowd applauding)

01:59.280 --> 02:01.362
(soothing piano music)

02:10.160 --> 02:12.242
(rhythmic guitar joins in)

02:18.800 --> 02:21.371
Seve: My love was always playing golf.

02:22.800 --> 02:25.531
Apart from golf, nothing existed for me.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.845
Nothing.

02:37.480 --> 02:41.610
(ﬂute joins in)
(men shouting in Spanish)

03:03.640 --> 03:05.722
(men shout louder)

03:09.600 --> 03:11.682

03:19.320 --> 03:21.049

03:52.640 --> 03:54.722

04:36.600 --> 04:40.002
Brother:

05:04.640 --> 05:06.722
(man singing a cappella)

05:27.680 --> 05:29.808
There's the church, right here.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.770
It's pretty old.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.249
And the school is on the right.

05:36.400 --> 05:37.970
Right here.

05:38.120 --> 05:39.690
There's my school.

05:42.000 --> 05:47.006
The golf course is right here.
Here is the sixth hole, down there.

05:51.240 --> 05:53.083
There's bad roads here, eh.

05:55.320 --> 05:57.402
(soft acoustic guitar music)

06:05.520 --> 06:07.488
That's where I lived.

06:07.640 --> 06:12.726
Seve: The house is about 100 years old
and it was a quite solid house I think.

06:12.880 --> 06:16.123
My father, he was a farmer.

06:18.640 --> 06:23.771
My father really worked very hard
but my mother worked even harder.

06:23.920 --> 06:27.845
She spent all her life for the family.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.165

(acoustic guitar music)

08:37.840 --> 08:39.922
(waves crashing)

08:42.799 --> 08:45.246
Seve: There's many ways to play golf.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.520
You can build your own golf course

08:48.680 --> 08:51.729
by using your imagination - wife all.

09:12.560 --> 09:17.043
Seve: Well, because I was not allowed
lo play or practice on the golf course,

09:17.240 --> 09:18.810
I used to play on the beach.

09:38.080 --> 09:41.129
I used to practice seven,
eight hours per day.

09:50.080 --> 09:52.003
No!

09:52.160 --> 09:53.969
(Splashes)

10:08.240 --> 10:10.322
(sewing machine rattles)

10:26.720 --> 10:28.210
Mother:

10:52.760 --> 10:54.888
(fade in; applause)

10:56.000 --> 11:00.847
Broadcaster: Severiano Ballesteros,
only nineteen coming here this morning,

11:01.000 --> 11:03.446
leading a field of world-class golfers.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.246
<i>Never before, in the history
of this great championship,</i>

11:08.400 --> 11:11.324
had a Spaniard
been leading the whole field.

11:12.760 --> 11:15.491
Yes! It's right in the middle of the hole.

11:16.440 --> 11:20.968
<i>He's realty tweaking their noses.
What great stuff from this youngster.</i>

11:23.320 --> 11:26.210
Can Ballesteros possibly make it?

11:26.360 --> 11:28.488
He's newborn into world-class golf

11:28.640 --> 11:32.611
and some say this very innocence
makes him oblivious to pressure.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.765
(hit)

11:39.080 --> 11:42.323
Seve: <i>First, a' was hitting the bah'
ah' over the place</i>

11:42.480 --> 11:45.563
<i>and started making double bogies
and triple bogies</i>

11:45.760 --> 11:47.046
Broadcaster: Oh, oh, oh.

11:51.280 --> 11:53.487
Wife. That's in trouble.

12:00.400 --> 12:05.088
Ballesteros battling to get back
into second place

12:05.280 --> 12:08.762
but he's got a long, long putt here
for an Eagle three.

12:14.160 --> 12:15.924
Right in for an Eagle.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.243
Quite astonishing,
this young Spanish player.

12:20.200 --> 12:24.046
Miller actually congratulates him
on that monster putt.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.600
No, he wants to get it in
two more from here

12:32.760 --> 12:35.286
to tie with Nicklaus for second place.

12:39.440 --> 12:44.401
I said he was about the only one that I
saw coming along that really impressed me.

12:44.560 --> 12:49.361
He was tremendous around the green.
He had a lot of imagination.

12:50.880 --> 12:52.450
Broadcaster: Yes!

12:52.600 --> 12:54.170
(applause)

12:54.320 --> 12:56.846
Broadcaster: Absolutely marvellous!

13:03.200 --> 13:04.770
Straight in the middle!

13:04.920 --> 13:09.767
What a prospect for the future and what
an exciting end to this championship.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.001
That great chip-and-run
between the bunkers on eighteen,

13:15.160 --> 13:18.926
man, that's a great shot.
I was very impressed with that.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.328
(applause)

13:37.800 --> 13:40.371
Senoras y senores, muchas gracias...

13:40.520 --> 13:42.602
(crowd laughs and applauds)

13:46.240 --> 13:51.280
Broadcaster: He may have made a heart
throb among the girls of Southport...

14:09.800 --> 14:11.882
(acoustic guitar music)

14:48.280 --> 14:50.362
(bell rings)

15:00.800 --> 15:02.928
(voice fades out)

15:03.080 --> 15:04.605
Seve: In my mind,

15:04.760 --> 15:10.563
I always dreamed and I always visualized
myself as becoming a champion.

15:12.560 --> 15:18.169
Broadcaster: Ballesteros is just about
to enter Leven's tigerish finish.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.641
It's good. It's got the tail wind.

15:24.080 --> 15:29.325
Oh yes! And the young matador
ls absolutely delighted!

15:29.480 --> 15:32.848
Against all the odds he takes
the outright lead yer again

15:33.000 --> 15:35.571
and can't wait to get to the next hole.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.767
Strong breeze, so it's rather bold...

15:39.920 --> 15:41.490
(applause)

15:41.640 --> 15:43.688
Broadcaster: He ﬂipped that one up.

15:44.400 --> 15:47.563
He's running, he's jumping, he's hurling.

15:47.720 --> 15:53.409
He really is charged up. This is what it
means by having your adrenaline ﬂowing.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.131
He had a great walk about him. His gait.

15:57.400 --> 16:00.290
He just strolled like a champion.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.209
(hit)

16:03.360 --> 16:07.081
Broadcaster: Well he's over on the
right-hand side somewhere.

16:07.240 --> 16:09.368
Looks like he's in the parking lot.

16:10.600 --> 16:15.401
Yes, he's certainly in the car park.
He's right up against the cars here.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.090
So where must I drop?

16:18.240 --> 16:24.202
You take the nearest point giving you
complete relief, no nearer the hole.

16:24.360 --> 16:27.887
- Well it must be over there, right?
- Wife correct.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.285
Seve: Over the years I've been called
the car park champion.

16:33.440 --> 16:35.010
(hit)

16:35.160 --> 16:38.209
Interviewer: Do you resent that?
Do you mind that?

16:38.360 --> 16:40.601
Seve: Golf is not how, it's how many.

16:48.360 --> 16:51.921
Broadcaster: Two putts from here
to remain two ahead.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.408
Crowd: Oh! Whoa! Yeah!
(applause)

16:55.560 --> 16:57.927
Broadcaster: And he only needs one!

16:59.240 --> 17:04.201
Well, the golfing gods really are
with the smiling Spaniard today.

17:06.960 --> 17:10.726
Hale Irwin, who was two shots ahead,
out of it now.

17:10.920 --> 17:15.050
But perhaps we are just moments away
from Severiano Ballesteros

17:15.200 --> 17:18.840
becoming the youngest
Open champion of this century.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.484
(hit)

17:22.400 --> 17:26.803
Broadcaster: He's played it out safely for
the front of the green.

17:29.160 --> 17:30.810
(crowd cheering)

17:34.720 --> 17:38.566
Broadcaster: Irwin going through the crowd
and surrendering.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.601
Somewhere back in the mass, Ballesteros
still battling his way through.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.522
(mild applause)

17:59.160 --> 18:03.643
<i>Broadcaster: And what</i> a <i>finish!
What</i> a <i>grandstand finish yet again</i>

18:03.800 --> 18:05.689
from the young Spanish wizard.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.730
(applause)

18:09.880 --> 18:13.327
Broadcaster: Ballesteros is the champion!

18:13.480 --> 18:17.724
Interviewer: Who were the two men who
came up and threw their arms around you?

18:17.880 --> 18:21.123
Seve: My brothers.
We are all the brothers here.

18:24.440 --> 18:29.162
Please, he hasn't yet recorded.
He hasn't yet recorded.

18:29.320 --> 18:33.450
Seve: Having all three of my brothers
there with me and supporting me

18:33.600 --> 18:36.809
and seeing all of them
just running through the green

18:36.960 --> 18:40.282
and giving me a big hug-
and I saw my brother crying.

18:41.480 --> 18:46.441
They realized that I did
something very important.

18:46.640 --> 18:49.405
Broadcaster: Severiano Ballesteros...

18:49.600 --> 18:52.171
(applause)

19:22.720 --> 19:24.802
(crowd cheering)

19:36.960 --> 19:40.123
Seve: It never crossed my mind
lo finish second.

19:40.320 --> 19:42.527
Second... no one would remember.

19:44.240 --> 19:45.890
I have to be the champion.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.969
Mother:

22:10.920 --> 22:12.524
Seve, Seve, Seve...

22:14.880 --> 22:17.247
Seve: I missed school many, many days.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.882
My father and my mother
think I go to school,

22:21.040 --> 22:24.044
but most of the days I didn't go.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.441
I'd make a little turn to the left.

22:27.040 --> 22:29.202
(acoustic guitar music)

22:34.480 --> 22:38.371
Seve: Playing golf with only one club,
you see, a three iron,

22:38.520 --> 22:42.889
that really helped me a lot because,
you know,

22:43.040 --> 22:45.884
I have to hit all kinds of shots
with only one club.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.123
I have to putt,
I have to drive with the three iron.

22:49.280 --> 22:53.001
That is why I have a very good ability,
you know.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.127
If you play with only one club,
it makes you think...

23:17.880 --> 23:20.611
(piano jazz music)
Broadcaster: April.

23:23.720 --> 23:28.886
Georgia. USA.
It's Masters time again.

23:30.160 --> 23:32.083
(hit)

23:34.160 --> 23:36.766
Paired with Gary Player
in this final round

23:36.920 --> 23:41.687
is 21 years old today Spanish star
Severiano Ballesteros.

23:41.840 --> 23:45.561
Winner of twenty professional tournaments
around the globe

23:45.720 --> 23:47.927
before he even got the key to the door.

23:48.080 --> 23:52.369
Seve: Gary Player was always my hero.

23:52.520 --> 23:55.524
And I wished already that we were friends.

23:55.680 --> 23:57.842
He is like my father.

23:59.120 --> 24:03.170
He was pulling so hard for me to win
and that's a nice feeling.

24:03.320 --> 24:08.451
When I holed that putt he walked across
the green with a million people watching

24:08.600 --> 24:14.289
<i>and he put his arm around me and he said:
"Got it. You reached me to win Masters."</i>

24:15.800 --> 24:19.691
Broadcaster: And here's the pride of
Europe, Severiano Ballesteros.

24:19.840 --> 24:22.810
Number seventeen, from about fifteen feet.

24:25.040 --> 24:26.610
(applause)

24:26.760 --> 24:30.162
Broadcaster:
Olé, and all is well with the world!

24:30.360 --> 24:35.048
This for a sixty-eight
and a seven stroke lead once again.

24:36.680 --> 24:38.682
And there it is, one more time!

24:38.840 --> 24:41.810
The magic touch of a man,
who not many years ago,

24:42.000 --> 24:44.367
owned little more than an old three iron

24:44.520 --> 24:48.525
and the certainty that some day,
he'd become a champion at this game.

24:49.480 --> 24:53.929
And there it is.
Comfortably parring number 16 and 17.

24:54.080 --> 24:56.651
And here, triumphantly, number 18,

24:56.800 --> 25:01.840
Seve Ballesteros, 23 years and four days
old, of Santander, Spain,

25:02.000 --> 25:05.482
played one third
of the 72 holes under par.

25:05.640 --> 25:09.565
A record, to become both
the youngest winner of the Masters

25:09.720 --> 25:12.041
and the first from Europe.

25:12.200 --> 25:15.010
Son of a farmer, youngest of four brothers

25:15.200 --> 25:18.329
and still living in the house
where he was born.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.770
Severiano Ballesteros!

25:20.920 --> 25:22.888
(applause)

25:23.080 --> 25:25.651
Broadcaster: The 1980 Masters champion!

25:27.240 --> 25:29.607
Olé indeed.

25:31.720 --> 25:35.122
His agent, Ed Barnard told us
that he had been at a luncheon

25:35.280 --> 25:39.683
and he, the agent,
was introduced by the toast-master

25:39.840 --> 25:45.404
as the manager of professional golfer
Ballerina Sevasteros.

29:17.320 --> 29:22.201
Seve: I started to caddy when I was nine.
At the beginning it was very good.

29:35.080 --> 29:40.405
Seve: But I think it's a little boring
to carry a golf bag to a very bad golfer.

29:40.560 --> 29:46.124
Because they go left, right, you have to
try and find the ball. It's very boring.

29:48.520 --> 29:52.286
But as soon as I started practicing
I enjoyed it very much

29:52.440 --> 29:58.049
and every time the members didn't see me,
I'd hit the ball or make a few swings.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.608
(chuckles)

30:45.480 --> 30:47.721
(hit)

31:00.520 --> 31:04.969
Seve: I played at night when it was dark.
Nobody saw me. On the beach.

31:07.280 --> 31:13.526
Maybe the strict rules helped me because
I was more anxious and hungry to practice.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.922
And the more difficult the thing,
the more you try.

31:20.560 --> 31:23.006
(hit)

31:23.400 --> 31:25.482
(applause fades in)

31:25.640 --> 31:30.168
Broadcaster: And what a finish!
What a grandstand finish yet again!

31:30.360 --> 31:32.727
Are you aware of the noise of the crowd

31:32.880 --> 31:36.521
when you concentrate on
the last hole of such a tournament?

31:36.680 --> 31:40.765
Seve: No. If your concentration is good,
you don't hear anything.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.485
Nothing worries you.

31:42.640 --> 31:47.328
But ff your concentration is not good,
even the ﬂies can bother you.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.642
Seve: Golf has always been fun.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.969
The good thing about golf is
that when you play golf

32:14.160 --> 32:18.370
you always produce one or two shots

32:18.520 --> 32:21.364
that really make you feel good

32:22.520 --> 32:28.050
and makes you think
'Oh, I think I'll come back tomorrow.'

32:28.200 --> 32:29.850
(applause)

32:33.440 --> 32:35.010
(Splash)

32:42.960 --> 32:45.247
(acoustic guitar music reprises)

32:52.560 --> 32:55.530
Interviewer:
Were you a well-behaved kid, Seve?

32:55.680 --> 32:58.047
Wife, I'd never get in any trouble. wife.

32:59.080 --> 33:02.243
Well yes... one time I...

33:03.120 --> 33:04.645
(laughs)

33:04.800 --> 33:05.847
Teacher

33:42.600 --> 33:44.170
(slaps)

33:52.440 --> 33:54.010
(slams door)

33:56.520 --> 33:58.090
(slow string music)

34:25.440 --> 34:27.010
Mama'?

34:28.040 --> 34:29.849
Papa?

34:36.000 --> 34:38.525
Seve: My father and my mother were away.

34:38.719 --> 34:40.404
There was a bottle of wine.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.763
I drank a few glasses
and I went back to school...

35:25.480 --> 35:27.608
(slams door)

35:44.040 --> 35:46.327
Mother:

36:21.000 --> 36:22.525
Mother:

36:24.200 --> 36:26.487
Father:

36:26.640 --> 36:28.210
Mother:

36:53.040 --> 36:58.410
Seve: This is the place in my house
where I used to practice when I was young.

36:58.560 --> 37:01.609
Because sometimes
there's bad weather here.

37:04.040 --> 37:07.487
And I didn't have
any other place to practice.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.211
Interviewer: You used to have a net there?

37:10.360 --> 37:14.649
Yes. Now I don't know where it is,
but I used to put it up here.

37:15.920 --> 37:18.207
(acoustic guitar music reprises)

37:54.240 --> 37:56.242
Mother:

37:56.400 --> 38:00.166
Seve: I used to practice at twelve,
one o'clock at night.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.284
My mother used to come down many times
and say: "Come up and go to sleep.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.681
What are you doing here?
You're crazy!"

38:08.600 --> 38:10.170
(sighs)

38:10.320 --> 38:12.971
It was good... a good place to practice.

38:18.040 --> 38:20.646
(people talking)

38:50.560 --> 38:55.282
Seve: I used to wait for the guard
and the caddy masters

38:55.880 --> 39:01.171
and the guy from the locker room to go by
to make sure that everything was clear.

39:02.720 --> 39:06.042
Once they went through...
I jumped.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.602
(grunts) (laughs)

39:18.400 --> 39:20.482
(upbeat music reprises)

39:28.360 --> 39:29.930
(applause fades in)

39:30.080 --> 39:35.041
Broadcaster: When you've got it -
you've got it! What a magnificent touch.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.769
(crowd cheers)

40:02.600 --> 40:05.001
(crowd cheers)

40:09.520 --> 40:11.602
(inaudible cheers)

40:14.200 --> 40:16.282
(applause)

40:19.320 --> 40:23.882
Broadcaster: Ladies and gentlemen, the
greatest golfer in the world!

40:24.040 --> 40:25.610
Severiano Ballesteros!

40:25.760 --> 40:27.683
(music fades out)

41:43.600 --> 41:45.682
(moving)

41:51.080 --> 41:53.560
Father: Vamos a casa, chicas, vamos.

41:54.800 --> 41:56.882
(moving)

42:47.040 --> 42:49.008
(acoustic guitar music)

42:49.160 --> 42:50.207
Doctor:

43:10.960 --> 43:15.124
When he stepped up to the ball, we knew
something exciting was going to happen.

43:15.840 --> 43:17.410
(hit)

43:18.320 --> 43:20.322
He was so aggressive in his drive.

43:20.480 --> 43:22.767
If there was a green over there at 3-20,

43:22.920 --> 43:28.131
he'd hit it 300 yards through the air
which was pretty impressive in that era.

43:36.200 --> 43:40.808
Seve: I took more risks than most people,
but that is my way.

43:45.200 --> 43:47.601
Nick Faldo: The way he played shots,

43:47.760 --> 43:50.240
and the way he swung the club,

43:50.400 --> 43:52.482
was beautiful.

43:52.640 --> 43:57.362
Ben Crenshaw: He had one of the most
beautiful set-ups I have ever seen.

43:58.760 --> 44:01.366
He had a style all of his own.

44:04.680 --> 44:07.365
He could get it up and down
from the trashcan.

44:07.520 --> 44:11.605
From the garage. From the car park.
You name it, he can do it.

44:13.720 --> 44:18.282
Ben Crenshaw: But his shod shots were
just something to behold.

44:18.440 --> 44:22.490
What a wonderful touch he had with
his hands and how creative he was.

44:22.680 --> 44:27.686
He was more like an artist painting
on a beautiful canvas around the green.

44:27.840 --> 44:30.969
Seve: It's something
that is very hard to describe.

44:31.120 --> 44:34.522
This feeling I have.
You feel it and you think about that.

44:34.680 --> 44:37.445
You visualize that and you feel it inside.

44:37.600 --> 44:39.125
And then you do it”.

44:40.160 --> 44:42.811
There's no secret. This is the way it is.

44:47.800 --> 44:49.370
Man: Muy bien.

44:50.080 --> 44:52.242
Seve:

45:05.880 --> 45:07.962
(cheering fades in)

45:08.120 --> 45:11.841
Certain people in life
have this little aura around them.

45:12.000 --> 45:14.731
Sinatra had it.
Elvis Presley had it.

45:14.880 --> 45:18.248
Geordie Best had it.
And he had it. It just oozed from him.

45:19.840 --> 45:23.242
Everywhere he went,
there was just this trail of people.

45:23.400 --> 45:24.925
"Have you seen Seve?“

45:25.080 --> 45:29.881
He was like a film star - “Have you seen
the latest Clint Eastwood movie?"

45:30.080 --> 45:32.208
He had that something about him.

45:33.880 --> 45:38.442
Seve: The only thing that at first
made me a bit worried is the attention

45:38.600 --> 45:42.207
that was created very quickly
from the media

45:42.360 --> 45:48.163
and from being a nobody to becoming
a superstar in just a few days, you know.

45:49.240 --> 45:51.891
My freedom disappeared.

45:54.240 --> 45:55.810
Especially in the UK.

45:58.520 --> 46:00.648
I was so popular.

46:00.800 --> 46:06.091
Broadcaster: This young Ballesteros
has suddenly become the crowd's hero.

46:06.280 --> 46:10.251
Peter Alliss: The British public
absolutely loved him,

46:10.400 --> 46:14.166
his style, his charisma,
his looks and everything.

46:14.320 --> 46:15.845
And he loved them.

46:16.560 --> 46:21.282
Guys, if you don't mind please.
I know you're nervous but I am too, okay.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.010
(they laugh)

46:23.160 --> 46:25.891
Broadcaster:
A little movement in the crowd.

46:29.480 --> 46:31.608
(crowd laughs and claps)

46:32.520 --> 46:36.730
Broadcaster: I think he saw that guy
as he popped it back inside there.

46:36.880 --> 46:40.043
When Seve turned around and:
"Nope. Not me. No."

46:40.920 --> 46:42.490
Lovely.

46:43.360 --> 46:47.285
Seve: I have to do nearly everything
in my room in the hotel.

46:47.440 --> 46:51.604
And that was tough for a young man
like me, you know. Very tough.

46:53.280 --> 46:57.365
But that was the price of the success.

47:01.560 --> 47:03.767
(hit)

47:04.520 --> 47:06.648
(cows moo)

47:45.240 --> 47:46.890
(cow moos)

47:47.960 --> 47:49.769
(hit)

47:52.480 --> 47:54.164
(cow moos)

48:04.840 --> 48:07.571
(acoustic guitar music reprises)

48:07.720 --> 48:12.408
Broadcaster: There's certainly no
holding back over these finishing holes.

48:12.560 --> 48:17.805
He's just lashing at the bail with every
ounce of power in his substantial body.

48:19.560 --> 48:21.130
Number two. Par five.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.282
(applause)

48:36.000 --> 48:37.525
(crowd cheering)

48:37.720 --> 48:40.929
Broadcaster: Well done.
Slam bam! Birdie. Eagle.

48:41.080 --> 48:43.560
And suddenly, after being a shot astray,

48:43.720 --> 48:47.486
Seve Ballesteros is leading
the Masters by two strokes.

48:50.320 --> 48:51.845
(hit)

48:54.440 --> 48:58.365
Broadcaster: And isn't this just
the most unbelievable golf?

49:02.600 --> 49:05.251
And it looks absolutely dead on the pin.

49:07.880 --> 49:10.247
Oh my goodness gracious!

49:10.400 --> 49:15.167
Where does a man get the moxy to hit
a shot like that at a moment like this?

49:15.320 --> 49:17.402
(applause)

49:21.560 --> 49:25.565
Seve: Because the Americans
always believed until later on

49:25.720 --> 49:29.725
that it was not possible
for any European to win the Masters,

49:29.880 --> 49:33.441
it makes me feel
very happy and very proud.

49:33.600 --> 49:36.490
(crowd cheering)

49:37.600 --> 49:41.810
Broadcaster: I guess it was meant for him
to be the champion.

49:43.360 --> 49:48.002
When he went to Augusta,
he broke some barriers for us, certainly.

49:48.160 --> 49:52.245
After him winning, it spurred on an
incredible European run.

49:53.400 --> 49:58.201
Seve: You're supposed to wear
the green jacket only during the Masters.

49:59.240 --> 50:00.810
(applause)

50:00.960 --> 50:05.761
Broadcaster: Severiano Ballesteros,
the 1983 Masters Champion.

50:08.120 --> 50:11.966
I took it home and... don't tell anybody,
ifs in my house.

50:12.120 --> 50:15.488
This is a replica, okay?
You understand?

50:16.440 --> 50:18.522
(chugging)

50:20.360 --> 50:22.442
(TV noise in the background)

50:31.640 --> 50:35.486
(film music: Finale of the
William Tell Overture by Rossini)

50:58.040 --> 50:59.326
Rafa:

50:59.480 --> 51:00.527
Seve:

51:09.360 --> 51:10.521
Seve:

51:17.520 --> 51:21.570
Seve: What really gives
you the perception of the distance

51:21.760 --> 51:24.730
and the feel, is if you swing
and you close your eyes.

51:24.880 --> 51:26.325
Seve:

51:30.920 --> 51:32.490
(hit)

51:34.760 --> 51:36.330
(hit)

51:48.040 --> 51:51.761
Seve: You can really know
which way the ball goes.

51:51.960 --> 51:55.567
Not only by sound, but also by feel.

51:55.720 --> 51:57.290
(hit)

51:57.440 --> 51:59.124
Seve: That helps.

52:18.840 --> 52:19.887
Rafa:

52:22.480 --> 52:23.891
Seve:

52:28.520 --> 52:30.602
Seve: First, you need the ability.

52:30.760 --> 52:34.048
But I think the mental side
is very important, too.

52:35.800 --> 52:39.566
You have to be cool.
You have to be very powerful.

52:40.800 --> 52:45.806
You have to be convinced
that you have a great chance to win.

52:51.520 --> 52:56.686
Seve: You can lose, but it must never
cross your mind. Always winning.

52:56.840 --> 53:00.890
<i>It's very important to keep
your face down. Don't took around.</i>

53:01.040 --> 53:04.931
Don't ever put your face up.
Talk as little as you can.

53:05.960 --> 53:09.407
And just put your eyes
with your ball and the hole.

53:12.320 --> 53:16.962
Man: He wouldn't exchange too many
pleasantries when he was playing.

53:17.120 --> 53:18.770
Obviously he was out to win.

53:18.960 --> 53:22.567
A great champ
is not concerned with anyone else.

53:22.760 --> 53:28.324
Broadcaster: Now Ballesteros - I'm sure
we're going to see a savage smash.

53:28.480 --> 53:32.565
Just look out, ball.
You don't know what you're in for...

53:32.720 --> 53:35.326
(hits)

53:35.520 --> 53:37.602
Broadcaster: I say' Take that!

53:42.080 --> 53:43.650
Seve: Mierda!

53:44.400 --> 53:46.926
Broadcaster:
He may be slightly cross...

53:47.080 --> 53:49.481
Those cold, black eyes are burning.

53:50.000 --> 53:52.128
(swears in Spanish)

53:55.560 --> 54:00.521
Seve: You never know what is going to
happen with me on each hole.

54:01.480 --> 54:03.767
Rafa:

54:05.840 --> 54:08.889
(rhythmic acoustic guitar music)

54:09.040 --> 54:13.011
Broadcaster: We have found Seve's ball,
but he really is in a dreadful position.

54:13.160 --> 54:15.686
He's right in the middle
of that willow scrub.

54:15.840 --> 54:17.365
Move back, please.

54:19.240 --> 54:21.811
Seve: No, I'm not a very steady player.

54:25.280 --> 54:26.805
Move back, please.

54:27.680 --> 54:32.481
Seve: The people like to see troubled
shots in the trees and the bunkers,

54:32.640 --> 54:36.281
and see me make bogies,
double-bogies, you know.

54:36.440 --> 54:41.401
<i>But I think one day</i> I <i>hit al'! my drives
straight to the fairway</i>

54:41.560 --> 54:44.723
The people will have lost
a lot of golf probably.

54:47.760 --> 54:52.129
<i>I always say that every time
that I go to the rough,</i>

54:52.280 --> 54:54.601
many times I can swing the club.

54:55.680 --> 54:59.162
I always believe that there is
always a shot somewhere.

54:59.320 --> 55:01.448
(hit) (applause)

55:17.280 --> 55:20.045
Seve: I've always been
very hard on myself,

55:20.200 --> 55:23.204
even when I fumed
professional in my early days.

55:25.080 --> 55:28.721
Seve: When I was having a bad day,
I would say to myself:

55:28.880 --> 55:32.327
<i>"Today you didn't do</i> a <i>good job,
you didn't play well,</i>

55:32.480 --> 55:37.168
so you don't deserve to have dinner."
So I went to bed without having dinner.

55:38.560 --> 55:41.166
That's one way to be hard on yourself...

55:41.320 --> 55:43.448
(hit) (Sighs)

55:43.600 --> 55:48.322
Broadcaster: When he was in the doldrums,
nobody could have looked sadder.

55:48.480 --> 55:52.849
You wanted to cuddle him and take him home
and let Mom make him tea.

55:53.000 --> 55:57.210
Seve: When I play bad,
I feel bad not only for myself

55:57.360 --> 56:00.682
I feel very bad for the people
who've come to watch.

56:02.720 --> 56:06.202
When you start having
some kind of failure,

56:06.360 --> 56:10.570
that's when you start getting tight
and you get worried.

56:10.760 --> 56:16.324
And it's like "I don't want to miss the
putt", not "I want to make the putt".

56:16.480 --> 56:22.010
Broadcaster: That's on line -
has it got the legs? Oh no, caramba.

56:22.160 --> 56:24.845
Another Spanish cries.

56:26.160 --> 56:28.242
Sever It's all in the mind.

56:49.400 --> 56:51.641
(rhythmic music)

57:02.480 --> 57:03.561
Rafa: Seve:

57:04.360 --> 57:08.001
Rafa:

57:26.120 --> 57:29.203
Rafa:

57:31.400 --> 57:32.447
Seve:

57:43.800 --> 57:48.249
Seve: When I have my three iron,
this is how I create all these shots.

57:49.400 --> 57:53.086
And all the ideas develop
In your imagination when you play.

57:54.560 --> 57:57.689
That's why I am always
very sharp and very quick

57:57.840 --> 58:03.847
in finding out the way to escape
to produce those miracle shots.

58:07.080 --> 58:09.162
(music becomes more rhythmic)

58:26.480 --> 58:30.041
(hit)

58:31.040 --> 58:32.610
(applause)

58:32.760 --> 58:35.889
Broadcaster:
He still has magic in his hands...

58:36.040 --> 58:38.088
Rafa:

58:38.280 --> 58:39.441
Seve:

58:47.720 --> 58:48.767
(hit)

58:49.840 --> 58:51.410
(hit)

58:59.560 --> 59:00.104
Brother:

59:11.400 --> 59:12.925
Yeah!

59:25.240 --> 59:26.765
(music builds up)

59:29.760 --> 59:34.926
Broadcaster: In she goes! 65 strokes!
Seve is the champion.

59:36.120 --> 59:38.487
(applause)

59:55.880 --> 59:58.201
(applause)

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.648
(family members toast)

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.882
(family chatting)

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.930
Seve:

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.320
Brother:

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.921
(soft piano music)

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:50.963
Father:

01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:03.208
Seve: To have success wherever
you play golf or do any other thing,

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.324
there are two things you need.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.246
<i>You have to work very hard</i> -
<i>that's number one.</i>

01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:14.405
And number Mo, you need
a tremendous amount of discipline.

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:20.721
Discipline is the key in life.
For many things.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.970
(hit)

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:30.163
Seve: You have lo take care of yourself.
You have to sleep eight hours every day.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:35.247
And practice - I go to the driving range
many times when I don't feel like it.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:40.965
You know what will be the best thing
for me for how I feel at the moment?

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.088
I'd like to go to the hotel.

01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:47.723
My boy is there and I would like to be
there and play with my boy.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:51.009
But do you know what?
Lam going to the driving range.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.090
Because I know that tomorrow is a big day
and I wan! to be ready.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.044
That's the profession.

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.210
(hit)

01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:08.445
(hit)

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:12.647
Broadcaster: Touch of class, baby.
Touch of class.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.528
(applause)

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.045
<i>Seve: Winning the Open is very difficult.</i>

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:28.409
Winning the Open at Si. Andrews
was something very, very special.

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.087
<i>Because St. Andrews is the home of golf,
and St. Andrews is...</i>

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.251
is a different type of golf course.
It's a piece of art.

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.325
Broadcaster: What a situation; Watson with
a putt for a birdie at the 13th,

01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:43.768
Ballesteros with a putt
for a birdie at the 14th.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:45.485
Watson first.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.202
(crowd cheering)

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.727
Broadcaster:
This would put him in a tie for the lead.

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.046
Oh touche'! (crowd cheering)

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:07.162
Would you credit it. Two putts.
Two birdies. Still tied at 11 under par.

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:11.047
Ballesteros, second and seventeen.

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:12.765
(hit)

01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.406
(crowd starting to cheer)

01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:24.724
Broadcaster: Whoa whoa whoa,
that's a marvellous shot.

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:27.002
(applause)

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:30.127
Broadcaster: Back on the 17th tee.

01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.807
(hit)

01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:37.930
Broadcaster: And he sent that off on the
perfect line.

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.045
Very brave.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:44.770
(applause)

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:52.924
Broadcaster: Seve for a three at 17.

01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:56.805
It's not tied yet.

01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.202
(applause)

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.968
Broadcaster: That's the four.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.729
Watson in the ideal spot down the 17th.

01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.090
Seve's already played the hole, got a 4.
So much can happen on the 17th.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:21.325
Oh...

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:23.045
(crowd groans)

01:05:24.560 --> 01:05:27.484
Broadcaster: Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear“.

01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:30.211
Well, they did say
it wasn't all over yet...

01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.449
That really was
an extraordinary shot from Tom.

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.809
Seve's second shot to the final hole.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.210
(hit)

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.249
Broadcaster: The dust ﬂies.

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.847
(crowd cheers)

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.281
<i>Broadcaster: What</i> a <i>little sweetie!</i>

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:53.921
Seve lining up a short-ish putt.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:56.730
This is for a 3.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.167
And he's just got his hole!

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.163
(crowd is cheering loudly)

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:09.810
Broadcaster:
You think he enjoyed that one?

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.763
Go on, give him a kiss as well.

01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:16.804
That's fantastic stuff'.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:27.769
This is St. Andrews, '84.
The best moment of my career,

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.851
so I thought that it was a good idea
to stamp that forever in my arm.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.368
Just there. Remember, Seve.
You're the best.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.602
(applause)

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.888
(applause becomes louder)

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:53.408
Seve: This is for my mother, who has come
to the Open for the first time.

01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.530
She is around here, I don't know...
somewhere.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.082
(upbeat mandolin music)

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.682
(cries of seagulls)

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.724
Brother:

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:53.167
Seve:

01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:16.200
Interviewer: What are the ambitions you
have in life generally, away from golf?

01:08:16.399 --> 01:08:20.928
Seve: I don't know... I've been
only thinking about golf. That's it.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:25.211
Interviewer: Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:30.124
Many. I have many.
But no steady one.

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:32.604
(hit)

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:37.482
He's so golf-orientated that all he does
is just play golf, golf, golf...

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:42.680
I think if I was Seve, I'd go out
to a few discotheques now and again

01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:45.286
and have a bit of fun, let yourself go.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:53.804
Interviewer: A lot of people would say,
I'd like to be married and have a family.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:57.203
Well probably, yeah. Good idea.

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:04.522
He had those wonderful smouldering looks
that sent many pulses racing, I tell you.

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:10.483
But he was a canny lad. And he married
his childhood sweetheart, Carmen.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.801
She was his golfing pupil.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:16.685
And they became man and wife
and had three children together.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:47.881
(soft guitar music)

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:30.450
Brother:

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.762
Seve:

01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:34.445
Brother:

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.325
Brian Moore:
The story of Severiano Ballesteros

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:40.444
is about a young Spaniard
from a humble background

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.809
who has become one of
the most controversial golf players

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.042
and an attraction for so many girls

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:48.726
in golf galleries around the world.

01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.167
But he's most in the news these days

01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:54.688
through his demands
for appearance money when he plays,

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.562
at a time when golf organizers are seeking
to stop this son of payment.

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:05.087
Seve: When you go to the golf course,
who are you going to watch?

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:07.883
The best players, isn't it.

01:12:08.040 --> 01:12:09.565
(cheering)

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:14.049
The best players bring the TV and
give the prestige to the tournament.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.329
And the best players
bring the people lo watch.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:24.003
If the sponsors want the best players,
they have to pay them. That's it.

01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:26.845
Interviewer:
But hasn't golf given you a lot else?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.207
Do you know how much I give to golf?

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.250
I started when I was nine.
And since then...

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:37.961
I live until right now, twenty-three.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:44.206
This way. All for golf.
You think this is not enough?

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:49.084
I think it's enough.
- Interviewer: Your life.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.370
All my life. And life is more important
than anything else, right?

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:55.648
So golf owes me something.

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.124
Or maybe we're even -
but I don't owe anything to golf.

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.842
(ﬂute music)

01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.762
(cows moo)

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.490
Father: Ho, ho!

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.922
(music fades out)

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.441
Man:

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.081
(laughs)

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:41.928
Brother: (Spanish)

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:03.802
(murmuring) (chatting)

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:25.248
(applause)

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:34.250
All: Seve! Seve!

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:48.887
As we were going out on the last day,
Seve said:

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:51.850
"The one with the biggest heart will win,"

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:55.451
<i>I thought, well, you mean you, don't you.</i>

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.162
(piano music)

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.326
(hit)

01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.562
(music becomes more rhythmic)

01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:17.647
(acoustic guitar joins in)

01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:23.887
(hit)

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.446
Broadcaster: Well, that is pure magic.

01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:40.610
Seve: When I walk into the ball
and I see the line and I see the shot,

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:45.482
it was very difficult if I say, okay,
let's play one of those shots

01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:47.768
that you did when you were young.

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:50.321
(applause)

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.448
Broadcaster: A touch of genius!

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:54.847
(hit)

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:03.130
Seve: From the background
I would have nothing.

01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:06.887
Remember, I had no balls. No clubs.
No money, nothing.

01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:11.443
I used to make bets without having any
pennies in my pocket.

01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:17.371
I had no choice. I had to win somehow.

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.561
So obviously
I became a tremendous competitor.

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.921
Dave Musgrove:
If somebody's playing good,

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.768
we say: He obviously has no money
because he can? afford to lose.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.687
That was Seve's attitude. He had no money.
Every week. And he expects to win.

01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.681
Dave Musgrove: If you caddied for him
for a while, you knew

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:09.730
he could simply handle
anything and anybody.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:13.566
<i>People thought it was</i>
a <i>prestigious position</i> - <i>but it wasn 't.</i>

01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:17.281
He made us realize that all day
and every day.

01:20:20.160 --> 01:20:22.766
After he won the Open,
the next time I saw him

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.645
he handed me a list
of things I had done wrong.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.327
Dave Musgrove: "Run after the ball!“
Over the hill.

01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:50.848
When I got there he'd go:
"Where have you been?“

01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:56.003
He never rested on his laurels.

01:20:56.200 --> 01:21:00.569
Maybe because he's the youngest of four,
and he always had to prove himself.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.290
(hit)

01:21:15.240 --> 01:21:18.244
Seve: I control my emotions really well.

01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:21.165
That always has been my strongest point.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.807
It's part of the game. If you cannot
control your emotions, you cannot play.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.210
(Silent)

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.721
Seve: I say to myself,
this is your tournament.

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.407
It may sound wife bit arrogant,
but I expect to win.

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.244
(all cheer)

01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.482
(applause)

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.291
Brother: Congratulations, little brother!

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:35.801
Seve: <i>When I play good I have so much fun
and so much pleasure</i>

01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.169
that there's no money
in the world that can pay that.

01:22:56.560 --> 01:22:59.291
(music fades into slow
string music)

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.682
(festive music fades in)

01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.843
(Spanish)

01:24:31.720 --> 01:24:34.041
(crackling) (all cheer)

01:24:39.040 --> 01:24:41.122
(exploding)

01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.607
Seve:

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.841
Rafa:

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:04.242
Rafa: Come on, Seve!

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.801
(shouting)

01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.322
BOY?

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.680
Seve:

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:23.804
Boys:

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.006
(they laugh)

01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.647
(hit)

01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.287
Rafa:

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:26.127
Mother:

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.604
Seve: My father was always telling me
that I would be a good golfer

01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.210
and he always said "keep going, you look
great and you have the power.

01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:43.931
You'll be great and golf is very easy."

01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:47.804
He'd say those things.
And that helps.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:52.403
My mother tried to find me a job
- A safe job.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.443
Maybe go and work in a factory

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:01.366
or maybe study
and be a lawyer or something else.

01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:05.445
But a safe position, you know.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.886
Sergio:

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:20.800
Father:

01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.883
Mother:

01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:50.729
Father:

01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:11.285
Father:

01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:24.369
Brother:

01:30:10.560 --> 01:30:11.800
Brother:

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:41.129
Brother:

01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:46.287
(light-hearted music fades in)

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.925
Broadcaster:
On a warm, wind/ass Sunday,

01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:55.323
four men arrive for one of golf's great
finishes.

01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.562
(they greet each other)

01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:06.607
Interviewer: How are you today?
- Pretty good, it's a beautiful day.

01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.809
Fan: We're pulling for you, Jack!
- Oh, thank you.

01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.769
Fan: You play well! - I'll try.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:17.528
Who do you think might win this Masters?
Would you pick a champion?

01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:22.402
I don't think you can ever win doing that
but Ballesteros will probably win

01:31:22.560 --> 01:31:25.848
because he is definitely
the best player in the world.

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:33.766
Seve: This is one thing that I have.
I have it in my heart.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:36.210
(hit)

01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:41.530
Seve: Coming into the Masters,
I didn't have a chance to practice

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.529
because my father was sick.

01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:46.451
Broadcaster: Here it comes!

01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.966
Seve: I did promise my father. I said:

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:56.923
"I want you to come to the Masters because
this year I am going to win it for you."

01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.690
I never thought
he was going lo die so early.

01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:09.044
He passed away the 5th of March
and I went to play the Masters

01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:13.683
with only nine rounds of competition
in six months.

01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.048
Broadcaster: Seve for an Eagle.

01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:24.203
What a moment. What a moment to do it.

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:26.169
(applause)

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.131
I'm standing in the middle
of the field on the 15th,

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.002
and I hit a four onto the green.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.287
(crowd cheering)

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:44.968
Broadcaster: And he's got a chance.
He's got a very, very good chance

01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:49.801
of an Eagle three
to make him seven under par.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:55.491
Yes, Sir!
And the old bear is back!

01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:01.047
<i>Jack Nicklaus,
knowing he must continue the charge.</i>

01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:06.240
He has to figure that Ballesteros
will make at least Birdie back al fifteen.

01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:08.482
(applause)

01:33:11.800 --> 01:33:14.326
Oh my. And there's no doubt about it.

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:18.161
The bear has come out of hibernation.

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:24.609
Obviously, Jack played fantastic
down the straights on the last five holes,

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:28.890
but I was two shots ahead and I hit
a beautiful tee shot on the 15th.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.765
(cheering)

01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:34.321
Sever And I have to wait a little bit.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:38.486
He had the feeling that, until that point,

01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:43.202
it he really wanted to win something
he could dictate: I'm going to win this.

01:33:44.520 --> 01:33:48.127
The tournament will be over
before the 16th this year.

01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:52.686
Interviewer: I don? need to ask how.
- My way. Of course.

01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:01.049
<i>Broadcaster: Right now, it is
Seve Ballesteros's Masters to lose.</i>

01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:03.328
(suspenseful music)

01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:05.005
(hit)

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:08.602
Broadcaster: That was the worst shot
I've seen him hit...

01:34:09.960 --> 01:34:11.530
He got it in the water.

01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:15.366
He let go of the club. It looks like
something happened there.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.243
That's absolutely extraordinary. I don't
think We ever seen him hit such a shot.

01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:25.371
<i>Jack Nicklaus: He's on the 17th tee
and Seve hits it into the water.</i>

01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:29.081
And I heard the sound.
I knew exactly what it was.

01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:33.768
Because it was the sound of not cheering,
but some groaning...

01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:38.483
I guess that was the destiny for me -
not to win.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:42.969
Broadcaster: Maybe”.

01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:44.849
Yes, Sir!

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.446
(applause)

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:55.527
Seve: It was great,
the way Jack Nicklaus played.

01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:02.885
But the bitterness
that I have inside my body

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.327
because I didn't win for my father.

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:08.006
(slow acoustic guitar music)

01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:38.281
Peter Alliss: He was never
the same after that Masters.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.250
But being back at Lytham inspired him.

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:43.850
How are you?

01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:54.081
The greatest I saw him play

01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:55.571
(hit)

01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:58.929
was that Monday when Pricey and I

01:35:59.080 --> 01:36:00.650
and Seve went oh'.

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.611
Broadcaster: Now this could play in”.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:09.124
(applause)

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:13.041
Broadcaster: He can'! see the bottom of
the ﬂag, so that's not bad.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:15.925
Nick Faldo: When you see a guy playing

01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.762
when they're just unbelievable.
And that was probably his finest day.

01:36:20.960 --> 01:36:22.724
(crowd cheers)

01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:26.402
Nick Faldo: That was the day
when he was the true Seve.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:29.643
He pieced together that round
and I said to him:

01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.730
"That was the best round of golf
I've ever seen."

01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:37.526
Seve and! distanced ourselves
from the rest of the field

01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:41.730
toward the end of the front nine and we
played the last eleven holes,

01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.848
and one of
us was going to win it.

01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:49.166
Peter Alliss: If you size up the guys
you're playing with and they're fidgety

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:53.206
and some guys' eyes
are darting all over the place...

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:54.885
(crowd cheers)

01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:58.362
Broadcaster: Oh, I say. That was a killer.

01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:02.766
Peter Alliss:
And Seve was just so focused that day.

01:37:03.640 --> 01:37:05.722
(applause)

01:37:08.720 --> 01:37:09.801
(hit)

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:16.962
(applause)

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:23.008
Broadcaster (chuckles):
What a fantastic stroke.

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.730
(crowd cheers)

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:27.451
(applause)

01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.685
Broadcaster:
Five Birdies and an Eagle in seven holes.

01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.201
(hit)

01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:41.765
(crowd cheers)

01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.763
Broadcaster: Oh, look at that.

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:50.445
This hole is certainly one Seve
will remember all his life.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:52.170
(applause)

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:59.006
Broadcaster: What a moment to produce a
stroke like that.

01:37:59.160 --> 01:38:01.640
Oh I bet his little heart is thumping.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.287
(hit)

01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.325
Broadcaster:
It looked to be a smooth rhythm.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.682
(crowd groans)

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:22.610
Broadcaster: It's easy to slide the club
under the ball and not give it enough.

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.001
Seve: I have the picture very clear,
so I went back

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.960
took the sand wedge,
took a couple of practice.

01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:34.090
Looked... and when I hit it,

01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:36.049
as soon as I hit it I saw the ball

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.931
go up in the air and it was perfect.

01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.162
(crowd cheering)

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:56.085
Broadcaster: In she goes. 65 strokes.
Seve is once more the champion.

01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.126
Nick Price: Most of us have twenty or
thirty different ways of shooting 65.

01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:06.444
Seve has 1500 ways of shooting 65.

01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:09.490
Seve: Well first of all,
I 'd just like lo say that

01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:13.804
it's a pity I didn't find any cars on the
sixteenth fairway this time.

01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.610
(all laugh)

01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.044
Unfortunately, you should park your cars
next time on the fairway.

01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.602
I'm becoming a very straight player now.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:27.246
I must say thanks to all you people

01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:32.645
because without your support I don't think
I'd be champion right now. Thank you.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.723
Announcer: Seve, thank you.

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:36.962
(crowd cheering)

01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:41.569
<i>Peter Alliss: We thought he's back,
but he didn't win another major.</i>

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:45.088
But he was still a huge force
for many years to come.

01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:51.529
The Ryder Cup was establish in 1927
as a bl-annual match

01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.570
between the British Isles
and the USA.

01:39:54.720 --> 01:39:57.564
In 1979, the British team was reinforced

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.003
with the finest golfers
from continental Europe.

01:40:01.160 --> 01:40:05.051
But up until 1985,
the Americans had only lost three times.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.329
Then, things began to change.

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.560
Tom Watson: The Ryder Cup was dying
and that would be his legacy

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:17.691
in taking the Ryder Cup and turning it
around for the European team

01:40:17.840 --> 01:40:20.411
and making it the event it is today.

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.244
(acoustic guitar music)

01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:26.246
He was Robin Hood.
And they were the wealthy sheriffs.

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:31.167
Broadcaster:
If you're ever in a jam, here I am.

01:40:31.320 --> 01:40:35.245
Ken Brown: And he was going to show
the sheriffs how to play.

01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:38.201
Broadcaster: Thank you, partner.

01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:41.967
They're running out of holes.
There's only four more.

01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:47.484
It swings quite a way from there - has it
got the pace - it has... ifs in!

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.569
(applause)

01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.123
Broadcaster:
It's the magic we were waiting for.

01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.760
Onlooker: Ge! in! Get in!

01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:00.083
Broadcaster:
That's the second hole in a row he's won.

01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.805
Two Birdies...

01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:05.362
Ballesteros's brilliance needed here...

01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:08.648
And he's done it!

01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:13.124
A Birdie four, and he's levelled the
march.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.967
Magic! Tremendous form!

01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:20.044
Ballesteros and Kite,
a wonderful exhibition

01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:22.771
of straight playing and sportsmanship.

01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:26.001
These super professionals.

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:30.290
It would be rather splendid
if Thomas could just roll this right in

01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:32.010
to win the Ryder Cup.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.811
(crowd cheering)

01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.042
(applause)

01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.651
I feel like I just won
another British Open.

01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:47.330
I feel even better because I saw all the
people out there. This is fantastic.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.165
Seve: That Ryder Cup was really very
special for everybody

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.130
because we beat the Americans.

01:41:56.280 --> 01:42:02.481
(crowd singing
"For he's a Jolly Good Fellow")

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:09.889
(all cheering)

01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.249
Broadcaster:
When Seve teamed up with Olazabal,

01:42:15.440 --> 01:42:19.764
they turned things Europe's way.
They were a very special partnership.

01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:24.767
They had complete trust in one another's
game and became virtually unbeatable.

01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:28.527
Announcer:
From Spain, José Maria Olazabal.

01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:32.526
Olazabal: In '87, when I was paired
with Severiano Ballesteros

01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:36.844
obviously I was very nervous, rocky.
It was my first Ryder Cup.

01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:40.010
I was walking towards the tee,
and Seve came,

01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:44.449
<i>stood by my side;
he looked at me and said: "Jose,</i>

01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:47.968
you just play your game,
I will take care of the rest.“

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:50.930
And yes he did -
he did take care of the rest.

01:42:51.720 --> 01:42:55.930
Those Ryder Cup partnerships -
I don't think there's been any finer.

01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.369
Seve: We understand each other without
talking. Just by looking.

01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:06.562
And that's the reason why we've been
so successful in the Ryder Cup.

01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:10.563
Broadcaster: A smart idea
of Captain Anthony Jacklin

01:43:10.720 --> 01:43:15.123
to pair the older Spanish golfer
with the younger Spanish golfer.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.682
That's a good pairing.
I wouldn't break that team up.

01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.250
José just needs to get this out on the
green.

01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:27.441
(crowd cheers)

01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:32.845
We only needed two putts on the 18th green
to tie the hole and win the match.

01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.243
Broadcaster: It looks okay...
now just a minute!

01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:39.808
Seve: I look at the ball
and I don't believe it.

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:43.407
"Oh shit, that was really fast.
I can? believe it."

01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:49.011
Olazabal: <i>My god - that's not
the putt I</i> wanted <i>to have.</i>

01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:54.567
Broadcaster: The thing he did not want
to do, is leave his young countryman here

01:43:54.720 --> 01:43:59.806
for the first time on this level,
with this putt lo win the match.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.924
Now this kid has to make it,
or they lose the hole

01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:07.130
and only have the match and
they were three up for most of the day.

01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.090
Olazabal: He knew he put me
in a tough spot.

01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:17.002
Broadcaster: Okay. It's settled. And they
hang on to win the match. Another point.

01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:20.881
Olazabal: Once (made the putt
I came back to him and I said:

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:24.123
"don't you ever do that again to me,"

01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.409
Broadcaster: And there it was.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:31.770
Let history show that that was it,
to put them at fourteen ahead.

01:44:33.280 --> 01:44:36.568
Ballesteros has had an
incredible week here.

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.691
And the emotion is just building here
for these Europeans.

01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:47.361
Seve: It was one of those moments that
give you faith for the rest of the day.

01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.602
(applause)

01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.287
(hit)

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:01.765
Broadcaster: That's coming back on the
wind. Does he like it?

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.325
Oh, I bet he does!

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:09.691
<i>He was beginning to grin.
He couldn't quite hide the grin.</i>

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.524
On, I say...

01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:13.447
(hit)

01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.330
Crowd: Ohh!

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.484
Broadcaster: That started left.

01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:21.961
(broadcasters laugh)
(crowd cheers)

01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:25.249
Broadcasters:
An almost embarrassment of riches.

01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:28.449
Olazabal: You might think
you are competitive,

01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:34.050
but when you play with Seve and you see
how he thinks and drives on the course...

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.282
Broadcaster: Oh yeah, all the way.

01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.842
Olazabal:
You realize that he is at another level.

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.127
He quickly got a reputation,
match-play wise,

01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:47.602
he didn't give an inch;
he was as rough as nails.

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:50.923
Seve: You're switching
the compression on the team?

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:52.809
- No.
- Yes, you did.

01:45:52.960 --> 01:45:56.442
Tony Jacklin: Being tough is part of
being a great player.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:59.251
And there was nobody
tougher than Seve.

01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:03.371
Seve: I don't know - we saw two balls.

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.602
He played two different balls.

01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:12.642
Seve: There's no better feeling
or better taste than to be the best.

01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:15.688
You always want to be the best.

01:46:19.920 --> 01:46:23.367
Announcer:
Now please welcome Severiano Ballesteros.

01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:26.040
The captain of the European team.

01:46:26.200 --> 01:46:31.570
Seve: To finalize my contribution
and my record in the Ryder Cup,

01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:38.328
I fell that I needed to be the captain.
I thought It was my obligation.

01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:42.411
Broadcaster: Carmen leading the cheers.

01:46:42.560 --> 01:46:48.488
It is a great honour for me
to welcome you to Valderrama today,

01:46:48.640 --> 01:46:51.325
to the thirty-second Ryder Cup matches.

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:53.050
(crowd cheering)

01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:58.286
Golfer: In the beginning Seve was great.

01:46:58.440 --> 01:47:03.924
"I don? want to put any pressure on you,
I want you to relax. No pressure at all."

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:07.721
Skip to Saturday night: "We have to win!

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:09.291
We have to try hard.

01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:15.522
Don't hit it in the bunker. Don't three
putt. Don't hit into the trees on 16!

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.490
Seve was off the charts
when he was captain.

01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:25.283
Was he a good captain?
Seve got the result.

01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.124
I'll leave it like that.

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:33.241
Golfer: Monty asked me: "Am I playing?“
I said: 'Don't ask me, ask your captain.“

01:47:33.400 --> 01:47:38.122
I had to tel! all the guys: "Go and ask
him straight - am I playing or not?"

01:47:39.080 --> 01:47:42.801
Seve: Because of the rules,
I had to leave four guys out.

01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:45.804
Interviewer:
Was it difficult to tell them?

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.851
Wife. they... I haven't talked to them.

01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:56.084
Colin M.: He wanted to play Langer's,
Faldo's, mine, everybodies shot.

01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:00.080
Then he came up to me and he told me
how to do it and what to do.

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:06.326
<i>I had to be quite rude at one stage,
I said: "I'm sorry, Seve. I'm okay."</i>

01:48:09.040 --> 01:48:14.524
Golfer: Colin Montgomerie said he wished
he'd just get on his buggy and go away.

01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:19.891
Olazabal: He was trying 100 percent, never
gave up, and he takes that everywhere.

01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.441
On as well as off the golf course.

01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.122
<i>I said: "Captain, that's it."</i>

01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.521
(crowd cheering)

01:48:28.680 --> 01:48:32.651
Broadcaster:
Montgomerie gets the nod and it's victory

01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.246
for Seve's stars and Southern Spain.

01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:39.286
Somewhere in there is
Severiano Ballesteros.

01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:42.603
And Seve, this week,
has been master of the game.

01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:46.924
Interviewer: Fabulous moment.
Proudest moment of your career?

01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:51.091
I think so. I've won many great
tournaments around the world,

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:55.211
I've won five majors,
five world matches,

01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.887
six orders of merit and all that.
But this is very special.

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.851
He was tremendously inﬂuential
and a pain in the neck to some,

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.924
but all in all he was a giant,
and for a some years

01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:11.527
he ruled the roost
and inspired Europeans all over.

01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:13.205
(crowd cheering)

01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.961
Broadcaster:
If I wanted a cup right now, it's Seve's.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.602
(slow piano music)

01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:32.360
Seve: Golf, it can really make you
feel like you are like God one day.

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:35.410
And the next day
it makes you feel miserable.

01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:40.043
Lately I have to say that things have been
very rough and very difficult for me.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.770
I miss my family.

01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:47.284
The life is not as easy
as many people may think.

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:52.050
Interviewer: Did you think:
"What more can I do?

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.680
Surely it's time for me to retire now?“

01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:57.366
Retire? Never.

01:49:57.520 --> 01:50:00.967
Interviewer: Never retire?
- The white ﬂag up? Never.

01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.442
It would be a surrender, wouldn't it?
- Yes. Never.

01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:10.405
Seve: I still produce better shots
than anybody else there.

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.043
Chip. Bunker shot. Under the trees.
Whatever.

01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.364
And I think I can produce,
now and then, good golf.

01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:22.170
(cheers)

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:24.969
Interviewer: That's enough?

01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:29.011
Seve: I don't need to prove
that I'm Severiano Ballesteros

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.721
and I can still beat those youngsters. No.

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:38.489
Nobody told me when to start playing golf
Why should anyone tell me when to retire?

01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:40.722
(onlookers applaud)

01:50:42.840 --> 01:50:44.410
When I die.

01:50:45.480 --> 01:50:47.482
Retire? Never.

01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.929
Peter Alliss: His bad back
was the biggest problem.

01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:57.125
It was really sad to see
the decline of his once brilliant game.

01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:03.006
I really thought he would go on forever.
I thought he was indestructible.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:05.208
Seve: It was an internal fight.

01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.247
It was difficult for quite a while.

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:12.963
So that really made me think,

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:15.810
very deeply.

01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.527
The real question is:
Either you continue, or you stop playing.

01:51:26.080 --> 01:51:29.880
And I've made probably
the most difficult decision

01:51:30.040 --> 01:51:33.522
of my career as a player.

01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:37.327
And I decided to retire.

01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:39.721
(soft piano music)

01:51:40.680 --> 01:51:42.091
(hit)

01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:49.371
Seve: To say that I'm not going to play
golf anymore...

01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:59.689
is like taking a piece of your heart
and putting it away.

01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:04.850
I'm okay, I'm okay”.

01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.809
There's still some kind sadness there
because it's not easy to accept

01:52:11.960 --> 01:52:17.490
<i>you are retired from something you have
done for thirty-three years.</i>

01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:19.722
(crowd cheering)

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.249
Seve: It's... not easy.

01:52:22.400 --> 01:52:24.562
(crowd cheering)

01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:28.281
Broadcaster: Seve did his
little boxing routine at the end

01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:33.401
which I'm sure well see time and time
again. And wasn't it all worthwhile.

01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.484
I've been lucky
to have three opportunities

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:44.443
to get a chance to pick his brains and
spend time with him, just chipping.

01:52:44.600 --> 01:52:46.523
I learned so much in short time.

01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:51.527
How to play shots.
It was phenomenal.

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:55.002
Broadcaster:
He pitched it just short of the green

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:58.329
and he looks to have got
the pace to perfection.

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:01.850
I couldn't pull it off, but he always did.

01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:04.122
(applause)

01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:10.729
I think all of us golfers
are going to miss him.

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:19.842
Seve: Everything starts
and everything has to finish.

01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.722
(soft acoustic guitar music)

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:37.564
Severiano Ballesteros
is in a stable condition

01:53:37.720 --> 01:53:39.609
after a brain tumor operation.

01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.128
<i>The golfing legend was diagnosed
with</i> a <i>tumor last week</i>

01:53:43.280 --> 01:53:45.123
after collapsing in Madrid.

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:50.207
Doctors operated straight away
because of the serious situation.

01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:05.051
Seve: I didn't want to feel any panic
or show my emotions to them

01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.885
<i>because you don't win
anything by doing that</i>

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:12.762
so the best thing is
to just be prepared and to be relaxed

01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:17.050
and show a good, optimistic position.

01:54:22.040 --> 01:54:27.001
Life is like a sport.
You have to fight every day for things.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:31.529
Fight all the way.
The key is to just never give up.

01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:36.807
And this is what I would call destiny.

01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.927
One test that God is putting on me.

01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:45.890
And I am winning. I'm going to
hole the 18th putt at St. Andrews.

01:54:46.040 --> 01:54:47.610
(chuckles)

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:53.209
With great pleasure we welcome
live from his home in Pedrena, Spain,

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:55.164
Severiano Ballesteros.

01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.886
(applause)
(orchestral show music)

01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:15.010
(music fades out)

01:55:15.160 --> 01:55:20.530
It is an immense pleasure for me
to present you with this award.

01:55:21.200 --> 01:55:23.680
The Lifetime Achievement Award.

01:55:23.840 --> 01:55:26.969
And for this, I think we should stand up.
- Yes.

01:55:28.880 --> 01:55:31.531
Congratulations, my friend.
- Thank you.

01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:34.809
From a great champion like you are.
- Thank you.

01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.406
(applause fades in)

01:55:39.760 --> 01:55:41.000
Thank you to you all.

01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:01.922
(soft piano music)

01:56:23.320 --> 01:56:26.529
I don't want to see you people
feel sorry for me.

01:56:26.680 --> 01:56:29.286
L've been the luckiest person
in the world.

01:56:29.440 --> 01:56:34.002
I've had so much luck and
I've had so much fun for so many years

01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:40.042
that this thing that just happened to me
is just a very little thing

01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:45.081
compared to other people
who have tougher times.

01:56:45.240 --> 01:56:49.325
And they don't have
the opportunity to live a life

01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.842
so intense and as good as I did.

01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:55.002
So, thank you very much.

01:56:55.160 --> 01:56:58.004
And I love you all from my heart.
Thank you.

01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:07.931
Newsreader: The former world number
one golfer, Seve Ballesteros, has died.

01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:11.090
He lost his three-year battle
with a brain tumor

01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:13.925
at his home in northern Spain
this morning.

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.162
(soft acoustic guitar music)

01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:27.165
He was just a kid...

01:57:28.760 --> 01:57:30.285
in his village.

01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.770
(sighs)

01:57:41.000 --> 01:57:43.082
(some onlookers cheer)

01:57:43.720 --> 01:57:48.965
Broadcaster: Right in the heart of the
hole. A five Birdie finish for lan Poulter

01:57:49.160 --> 01:57:53.051
and he's given hope to the European side
that looked totally lost.

01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:56.443
United States, ten. Europe, six.

01:57:57.760 --> 01:58:01.401
Ian <i>Poulter: We've got</i> a <i>chance.
If we can do anything</i>

01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:05.565
to get our hands on this trophy
and Seve's looking down on us,

01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:08.240
then you gotta do what you gotta do.

01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:17.205
Broadcaster: And this is quite a shot.
Go in! Go in!

01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:20.927
That a boy, Paul! How about that shot!

01:58:22.400 --> 01:58:23.447
(hit)

01:58:27.640 --> 01:58:29.927
Broadcaster: Brilliant. Brilliant.

01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.804
(applause)

01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:34.122
Broadcaster: Fantastic, Rory!

01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:43.084
What a shot by lan Poulter,
our the trees at eighteen.

01:58:45.000 --> 01:58:47.082
(crowd cheering)

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:53.566
Broadcaster: He's got it.
This could happen here.

01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:57.167
I've just glanced down
and had a look at my left sleeve

01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:00.642
and that's the kind of stuff
he would have done today.

01:59:07.280 --> 01:59:09.282
Broadcaster: Thirteen hole.

01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:11.920
Europe have to find a full point.

01:59:14.240 --> 01:59:16.322
(applause fades in)

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:20.371
Broadcaster:
Our fate now is in the hands of Kaymer.

01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.403
A putt to win or lose the Ryder Cup...

01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:27.484
(crowd cheers)

01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:31.321
Broadcaster:
Unbelievable. It's Europe's Ryder Cup.

01:59:33.840 --> 01:59:35.763
Seve must have enjoyed that.

01:59:39.480 --> 01:59:42.643
Justin Rose:
We've got Seve on the arm and on the back

01:59:42.800 --> 01:59:44.848
I know he's up there, but...

01:59:45.000 --> 01:59:47.367
he'd be the proudest man
in the world right now.

01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:54.251
Olazabal:
I have a few thoughts for my friend, Seve

01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:58.246
and this one is for him.

02:00:01.520 --> 02:00:03.602
(slow string music)

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:08.849
(people distantly chanting)
Seve! Seve! Seve!

02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:19.243
I'm pretty sure he's very happy
where he is today.

02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:22.242
(applause)

02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:28.291
(chanting fades out)
Seve! Seve! Seve!

02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:30.522
(string music continues)

02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:42.567
(hit)

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.528
(waves crashing)

02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:42.846
(rhythmic flute and guitar music)

02:01:43.305 --> 02:01:49.386
