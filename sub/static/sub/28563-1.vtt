WEBVTT

02:02.917 --> 02:05.500
We're at eight thousand feet,
you can come off oxygen.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.832
How are you doing, Rear Gunner?

02:16.500 --> 02:17.500
EIGHT O'CLOCK!

02:18.917 --> 02:19.917
ALF, SLIDE RIGHT!

02:19.918 --> 02:20.918
I see her.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.500
Call them out, boys.

02:28.125 --> 02:30.492
Twelve o'clock high,
coming your way, Charlie.

02:35.500 --> 02:36.536
Mid-upper seven o'clock.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.991
Get us out of here, Alf.

03:00.542 --> 03:01.874
I think we lost him.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.494
SEVEN O'CLOCK HIGH!

03:10.833 --> 03:13.496
I clipped him,
but he's gone into the clouds.

03:15.083 --> 03:17.826
Okay stay switched on,
he might come around for another pass.

03:17.917 --> 03:19.783
Is everyone all right?

03:19.875 --> 03:21.582
Yes, George, no visual.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.366
Okay, George.

03:27.500 --> 03:28.866
Still here.

03:30.125 --> 03:32.492
But I think Thomas might need
a new pair of underpants.

03:36.500 --> 03:37.741
Alf...

03:39.125 --> 03:40.912
Alf, are you ok?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.332
Yes.

03:44.083 --> 03:45.083
Yes.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.415
Stay switched on, chaps.

07:29.167 --> 07:30.499
Douglas?

07:55.417 --> 07:56.749
Come in.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.491
Thank you.

08:38.042 --> 08:39.042
Mother.

08:42.417 --> 08:44.909
Mother, I've been offered a new squadron.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.991
And that's what you want?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.661
Yes.

09:03.042 --> 09:04.499
Mother.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.993
Father Patrick visited
the Price's house yesterday.

09:11.500 --> 09:15.915
Poor Debbie. How dreadful.

09:17.792 --> 09:19.499
I'll be fine.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.499
And you can promise me that?

09:29.292 --> 09:30.749
I leave this afternoon.

09:49.583 --> 09:51.495
Oh, thanks, Doug.

09:53.250 --> 09:56.493
Let's just get this chain on shall we.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.493
There she goes, that's it.

10:02.833 --> 10:05.496
Oh, there you are.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.492
Am I supposed to be wiping it off
or putting more on?

10:11.167 --> 10:12.499
Long time no see.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.616
You know what it's like.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.500
I join my new squadron tomorrow.

10:31.708 --> 10:32.708
Biscuit?

10:40.333 --> 10:42.416
He went past me
at a hundred miles an hour.

10:42.500 --> 10:43.661
Well he didn't have any brakes.

10:43.750 --> 10:46.413
There was nothing wrong with those brakes,
serviced them myself.

10:46.500 --> 10:49.413
Exactly, poor Ron didn't stand a chance.

10:57.042 --> 10:58.499
Douglas.

11:02.958 --> 11:04.415
Can I borrow you for a minute?

13:16.875 --> 13:18.411
I said no, Douglas!

13:18.500 --> 13:20.412
He can't stay here, it's not safe.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.412
I can protect him.

13:22.500 --> 13:23.500
You're not talking sense.

13:23.501 --> 13:25.412
I am not sending him away!

13:25.500 --> 13:26.500
You can still visit him.

13:26.583 --> 13:27.583
No!

13:27.584 --> 13:29.495
Will you keep your voices down!

13:34.958 --> 13:39.498
Come on, son. Let's inspect
these slovenly soldiers of yours.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.743
Come on, Douglas, you're going to be late.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.499
You don't have to come with me.

14:24.917 --> 14:25.917
Come on.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.001
Goodbye.

14:56.333 --> 14:57.494
Goodbye, Douglas.

15:43.500 --> 15:44.741
Twenty.

15:45.292 --> 15:46.533
Nah, come here.

15:47.667 --> 15:48.667
Every time.

15:48.917 --> 15:49.917
Four.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.365
Thank you.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.500
Thank you.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.498
Thank you so much.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.083
Have you thought about my offer beautiful?

16:09.083 --> 16:11.621
You know sometimes I really worry about you.

16:13.542 --> 16:14.874
Hey, Tom!

16:16.167 --> 16:17.157
Tom!

16:18.417 --> 16:19.498
Tell him.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.491
You're an animal.

16:23.042 --> 16:24.408
What do you think, Mummy's Boy?

16:24.500 --> 16:26.492
You're a disgrace to Bomber Command.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.417
Shut up! You're just jealous.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.867
Oh, now you leave Mummy's Boy alone.

16:31.958 --> 16:35.747
Just because he can't grow a moustache
does not mean he cannot attract the ladies.

16:38.042 --> 16:40.910
Oh don't worry, it will happen one day.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.492
Well you can't blame a guy for trying.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.999
Watch the master at work.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.078
Excuse me, miss.

16:59.792 --> 17:00.782
Yes?

17:00.875 --> 17:03.618
Might I just say how pretty you're looking
this evening.

17:03.958 --> 17:05.199
Thanks.

17:07.500 --> 17:11.743
Rubbish, even Mummy's Boy
can do better than that.

17:12.083 --> 17:14.665
Please excuse my oafish friend here.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.411
Watch it!

17:20.500 --> 17:21.661
You what?

17:22.500 --> 17:23.240
Piss off, mate!

17:23.333 --> 17:25.665
Simmer down, lads, simmer down.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.958
Huh, it was an accident.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.494
You RAF lot are all the same.

17:48.375 --> 17:49.491
I beg your pardon?

17:49.583 --> 17:52.200
We've been chasing Rommel
all over North Africa,

17:52.292 --> 17:55.785
whilst you lot get to sit in here
and enjoy yourselves every night.

17:55.917 --> 17:56.907
Lucky bastards.

18:01.583 --> 18:03.575
Let me show you something.

18:07.292 --> 18:10.956
Heads we live and tails we die.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.496
Heads! We live!

18:23.625 --> 18:26.493
Oh, dead!

18:32.333 --> 18:33.699
Dead again.

18:36.333 --> 18:38.916
So while we may get to go home every night,

18:39.958 --> 18:42.951
it is on the flip of a coin
whether we make it or not.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.494
Oh, lucky us.

19:01.667 --> 19:02.999
Think we're needed.

19:20.208 --> 19:21.415
Morning, sir.

19:21.625 --> 19:22.786
Morning.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.492
Here you are, sir.

19:37.167 --> 19:39.500
The guardroom is just off to your right.

19:40.750 --> 19:41.740
Thank you.

19:51.417 --> 19:52.828
- Go on.
- What's that?

19:53.500 --> 19:54.490
All right, George?

19:54.583 --> 19:55.573
Morning, Ted.

19:56.417 --> 19:59.034
This is Flight Lieutenant Miller,
your new Skipper.

20:26.167 --> 20:27.499
Huh-hum.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.124
Get up now.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.991
When can I see my aircraft?

20:52.083 --> 20:54.496
Tomorrow, sir, she's still all shot up
at the moment.

20:55.167 --> 20:56.533
Where are my quarters?

20:56.792 --> 20:58.124
This way, sir.

21:01.833 --> 21:03.495
Here you are.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.366
Thank you...

21:09.458 --> 21:10.619
Aircraftsman Daniels, sir.

21:10.708 --> 21:12.574
Thank you, Daniels, that will be all.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.161
You'll be ok.

21:50.250 --> 21:50.956
He'll be all right.

21:51.042 --> 21:54.490
You'll be there before you know it
and everything will be fine, okay?

21:54.708 --> 21:56.495
Yes, you look the part anyway.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.662
Time to go, old chap, take care.

21:59.250 --> 22:00.616
Bye, darling.

22:05.042 --> 22:06.203
He'll be all right.

22:30.625 --> 22:31.991
Ron, this is William.

22:32.167 --> 22:33.578
You're going to be sharing a room together.

22:33.917 --> 22:35.328
I'll leave you boys to it.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.490
Can I help?

23:06.083 --> 23:07.073
Thanks.

23:11.500 --> 23:12.741
You're going to love it here.

23:21.958 --> 23:23.244
Shh.

24:03.000 --> 24:05.492
Ah, Flight Lieutenant Miller.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.493
We haven't been properly introduced,
I'm George Williams.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.699
Williams, excellent.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.328
And where are you off to?

24:15.708 --> 24:16.619
The officers' mess.

24:16.708 --> 24:18.870
Oh no, no, no, you don't want to go there.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.790
Food's much better in the sergeants' mess.

24:22.333 --> 24:23.790
But it's the sergeants' mess.

24:24.167 --> 24:26.500
Well that's okay, I'm allowed in.

24:29.500 --> 24:31.287
You can be my plus one. Let's go.

24:36.500 --> 24:40.744
Nah, bet you three pound he'll win.

24:41.333 --> 24:43.416
At ease, gentlemen.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.331
Mind if we sit down, chaps?

24:44.417 --> 24:47.910
Sure.
Flight Lieutenant Miller isn't it?

24:48.500 --> 24:49.240
Yes.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.495
Nice to meet you.
Robert, Robert Murphy.

24:56.417 --> 24:57.498
Thomas Mayfield.

24:58.833 --> 25:00.665
Henry Smith, where are you from, sir?

25:01.167 --> 25:02.374
London.

25:02.625 --> 25:04.742
I'd like to speak to you all
before the briefing tomorrow.

25:05.375 --> 25:06.741
That's if she's fit to fly.

25:07.917 --> 25:09.453
I'm sure she will be.

25:16.792 --> 25:19.751
Hello, I'm James Parker, friends call me Jim.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.490
Nice to meet you, Parker.

25:31.375 --> 25:33.492
And what's your name, sergeant?

25:35.250 --> 25:36.491
Charlie Moore.

25:43.000 --> 25:47.495
I um... I heard you were a Spitfire pilot
during the blitz.

25:49.708 --> 25:50.619
I was.

25:50.708 --> 25:52.950
Jesus! What was that like?

25:53.792 --> 25:55.408
Much like this.

25:57.208 --> 26:01.623
It was good to meet you all.
Good evening.

26:05.167 --> 26:06.533
Christ.

26:07.833 --> 26:09.324
He's a bloody odd ball.

26:10.125 --> 26:12.833
Feel sorry for you, George,
sharing digs with him.

26:13.250 --> 26:15.116
Seems like a right barrel of laughs.

26:21.667 --> 26:22.748
Evening.

26:28.792 --> 26:30.624
You should've joined us.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.659
I'm quite alright.

26:36.292 --> 26:39.490
I bet you don't even drink do you?

26:41.333 --> 26:42.323
Not often.

26:43.167 --> 26:47.707
No, very self-disciplined, I'm sure.

26:54.500 --> 26:59.200
Ah, made yourself at home, I see.

27:24.542 --> 27:26.534
Flight Lieutenant Miller, I presume.

27:30.917 --> 27:32.499
How is she?

27:34.000 --> 27:35.491
She's not good, I'm afraid.

27:36.292 --> 27:37.749
She'll be fit for tonight?

27:40.417 --> 27:41.828
We'll do our best, sir.

28:24.667 --> 28:25.657
Morning, Skipper.

28:25.958 --> 28:26.948
Good morning.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.493
She's quite a beauty, isn't she?

28:34.375 --> 28:35.866
She is.

28:39.000 --> 28:41.492
I'd like to brief the crew before the off.

28:42.875 --> 28:43.865
Could you arrange that for me?

28:45.583 --> 28:47.495
You do know we're not flying tonight right?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.491
It's just been posted.

28:59.583 --> 29:01.495
It's not the best day for it anyway.

29:01.833 --> 29:03.995
You could use the time to get to know
the men a little better.

29:04.083 --> 29:10.705
Besides, I have been reliably informed
that the war will still be here tomorrow.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.574
Sir. Morning, George.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.286
Sergeant!

29:23.375 --> 29:24.661
Sir?

29:26.208 --> 29:29.326
At Fighter Command we salute
our superior officers.

29:38.333 --> 29:39.494
Prick!

29:42.917 --> 29:45.500
You do know you're not at Fighter Command
anymore, right?

29:48.583 --> 29:49.949
...Tea.

30:13.500 --> 30:18.666
All right, Ace, what's that?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.583
Is it the, altitude?

30:22.667 --> 30:28.743
Ah huh. Set a course for home.
Where are your compasses?

30:29.167 --> 30:31.500
There. And there.

30:31.958 --> 30:34.746
Right, you've got someone on your tail.
He gives you a short sharp burst;

30:34.833 --> 30:37.826
he's got your engine.
You've got a bit of smoke coming out of there.

30:38.417 --> 30:40.500
Err, engine temperature.

30:40.583 --> 30:41.824
Right.

30:43.417 --> 30:47.582
Also, keep an eye on your fuel.

30:48.167 --> 30:51.490
Okay. Half left.

30:53.208 --> 30:58.875
So you need to bring this a little bit more over.
Not too much or you'll flip yourself.

31:03.833 --> 31:06.621
He's a good lad really, they all are.

31:09.375 --> 31:11.708
You just need to get to know them.

31:17.083 --> 31:20.781
I used to be like you.
Bit of a lone wolf, kept to myself.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.119
Thing is, when you're around these chaps
doing what we do,

31:27.875 --> 31:30.367
you can't help but grow attached to the buggers.

31:31.667 --> 31:34.580
Oh, I really hate when that happens.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.663
Introduced to our WAAF's already, I see.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.666
Trouble they are, aren't you, girls?

32:00.500 --> 32:01.581
Who's your friend, George?

32:01.708 --> 32:05.327
Ah, now this is Flight Lieutenant Miller,
who... Urm.

32:07.042 --> 32:08.829
You are single aren't you?

32:09.500 --> 32:12.083
Take that as a yes.
Who is officially free for the taking.

32:12.167 --> 32:13.999
George, George.

32:15.750 --> 32:17.742
I've only got eyes for you, Georgie.

32:21.792 --> 32:23.454
That's Jo.

32:25.375 --> 32:27.162
Cheeky that one.

32:39.167 --> 32:40.624
Charlie.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.491
That Miller's a piece of work.

32:45.917 --> 32:46.828
What have you done this time?

32:46.917 --> 32:48.499
He pulled me up for not saluting.

32:49.667 --> 32:52.580
Yeah I know you're supposed to salute
a superior officer,

32:52.667 --> 32:54.329
but Alf never pulled us up on it, did he?

32:54.417 --> 32:56.079
And George certainly doesn't.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.824
He's not Alf, Charlie.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.662
I know but...

33:02.875 --> 33:04.366
What?

33:06.292 --> 33:07.828
Is it my go?

33:11.500 --> 33:12.911
I just think it's a bit much.

33:14.000 --> 33:15.536
Well it's not like he does it to you.

33:16.208 --> 33:21.499
I don't see the problem, Charlie.
If he said that to me I'd think fair enough.

33:25.667 --> 33:29.707
Yeah but, it's not what he said,
it's the way that he did it.

33:30.167 --> 33:31.499
Charlie!

33:32.083 --> 33:33.073
Yeah?

33:34.917 --> 33:37.079
Can a man not have a shit in peace?

33:38.917 --> 33:42.536
A... a... an... and
I honestly think if he had it his way,

33:42.625 --> 33:44.287
I'd be saluting my own mother
the next time I went home.

33:44.417 --> 33:46.500
God, is he still going on about it? Stop!

33:46.583 --> 33:48.165
Like a broken record.

33:48.667 --> 33:51.626
You don't get pulled up for your uniform,
do you, George? That's all I'm saying.

33:51.708 --> 33:55.247
Ah yes, that's because I don't let
a superior officer within ten feet of me. Now listen.

33:55.583 --> 33:59.156
I'm taking Flight Lieutenant Miller
down to the Red Lion

33:59.250 --> 34:01.788
for a drink and you are all invited to join us.

34:03.083 --> 34:04.619
Count me in.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.286
We'll be there, George.

34:08.042 --> 34:10.705
And you, best behaviour.

34:28.500 --> 34:29.411
Whose round is it now?

34:29.500 --> 34:30.581
Yours, Charlie.

34:38.333 --> 34:39.790
Well this looks like a barrel of laughs.

34:41.875 --> 34:45.447
You two holding hands down there again?
Err, what was that?

34:46.292 --> 34:46.998
What was what?

34:47.083 --> 34:49.496
Hand it over, right now.

34:50.417 --> 34:51.407
Hand what over?

34:51.500 --> 34:52.741
George!

35:10.583 --> 35:11.915
Back in a minute.

35:29.583 --> 35:30.994
Who is she?

35:34.750 --> 35:36.742
Alfie's wife.

35:46.917 --> 35:48.499
I'll go with him.

35:56.042 --> 35:57.499
Three pints, please.

36:00.333 --> 36:04.498
It's my fault you know.
I should tell her.

36:04.917 --> 36:06.499
What are you on about?

36:07.500 --> 36:08.490
Alf.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.491
Don't be so stupid.

36:15.292 --> 36:19.491
It's no one's fault.
He was unlucky, that's all Charlie.

36:22.250 --> 36:23.491
All right?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.957
Now come on, give me a hand with these.

36:43.500 --> 36:44.490
It was just for a second.

36:44.583 --> 36:48.577
Falling asleep even for a second
isn't all right, training exercise or not.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.499
No, it isn't.

36:51.708 --> 36:55.201
The odd thing is that you were
dreaming about your Mum.

36:55.292 --> 36:57.500
Now I would have been dreaming
about the barmaid down feathers.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.495
She's lovely.

36:59.708 --> 37:00.573
Mammy!

37:00.708 --> 37:02.199
No, he was louder than that.

37:03.292 --> 37:04.282
Mammy!

37:05.917 --> 37:06.998
Piss off.

37:07.083 --> 37:08.164
He'll set her on you, George.

37:08.250 --> 37:11.573
Oh, I don't mind.
I'm sure she's a handsome woman.

37:28.042 --> 37:30.659
He should have just come out.
I mean it's... Oh, sorry.

37:31.000 --> 37:33.367
Oh, hello!
You must be Flight Lieutenant Miller?

37:33.500 --> 37:34.365
Yes.

37:34.500 --> 37:35.581
I'm Kate.

37:36.958 --> 37:39.120
Well, good evening, Kate.

37:39.333 --> 37:43.122
They said you were a bit of a queer fish.
Aren't you staying with your friends?

37:44.500 --> 37:46.492
No, I've got to get back.

37:47.125 --> 37:50.823
Got to or want to?
Come on let's go and find George.

37:52.000 --> 37:52.786
No.

37:52.917 --> 37:56.410
Oh, you really are a queer fish.

37:56.917 --> 37:57.907
Fine.

38:18.167 --> 38:19.499
Morning.

38:26.833 --> 38:28.290
You were back late last night.

38:28.542 --> 38:31.501
Couple of WAAFs turned up after you left.
Good bunch.

38:32.000 --> 38:33.491
Morning, sir.

38:33.917 --> 38:35.658
I hear you spoke to Kate last night.

38:36.333 --> 38:37.494
We're not flying tonight.

38:38.167 --> 38:39.749
What is your rush?

38:42.375 --> 38:44.662
I don't like wasting my time.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.582
I'm here to fight a war.

38:47.708 --> 38:50.872
Not to go out every night
and get drunk with the rest of them.

38:52.833 --> 38:54.790
Oh, you just don't get it do you?

39:00.083 --> 39:03.247
Half the men on this base
won't survive your precious war.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.750
And for some getting pissed every night
is all they've got.

39:05.833 --> 39:08.905
So why don't you climb down
off your high horse.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.492
People might stop trying to push you off it.

39:21.583 --> 39:26.203
Being stuck on this base isn't good for you.
Come on.

39:42.083 --> 39:42.994
Morning, Kate.

39:43.083 --> 39:44.073
Morning, Peter.

39:44.500 --> 39:45.490
Did you go out last night?

39:45.833 --> 39:48.496
I did. Didn't see you.

39:48.708 --> 39:52.748
Not much chance of that.
Too busy with all this blasted paperwork.

39:53.333 --> 39:54.744
How was it?

39:55.500 --> 39:56.490
Good.

39:56.583 --> 39:58.495
Good? Is that all?

39:58.917 --> 40:00.909
She was talking to Flight Lieutenant Miller.

40:01.292 --> 40:02.078
Jo!

40:02.208 --> 40:05.747
Oh was she now?
How did it go?

40:07.167 --> 40:10.581
Nothing happened. He's a bit... Odd.

40:10.708 --> 40:11.698
More than a bit.

40:12.500 --> 40:15.083
They all are, my dear.
Trust me; you're better off

40:15.167 --> 40:17.705
with a simple sergeant like me.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.207
I don't like simple.

40:22.625 --> 40:25.242
You err... you couldn't fetch me a tea,
could you, Jo?

40:25.333 --> 40:26.699
Fetch it yourself!

40:32.583 --> 40:33.664
And here she is.

40:40.083 --> 40:41.494
Well?

40:43.208 --> 40:45.245
Well I can see why you kept her
a secret, George.

40:45.333 --> 40:49.327
Excuse me.
I will have you know that this car is a classic.

40:50.208 --> 40:51.494
Well she's certainly a classic.

40:52.208 --> 40:55.656
Wait a minute.
Is that a smile I see?

40:59.292 --> 41:04.538
And if you're very good,
I might let you take her for a spin one day.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.832
Well hop in, darling.

41:14.708 --> 41:16.324
Come on Charlie, get back in this fight.

41:37.667 --> 41:40.739
Come on. Come on, lad, come on.

41:43.000 --> 41:44.582
What's up?

41:45.042 --> 41:45.953
I don't know.

41:46.125 --> 41:47.161
You haven't lost a fight yet,

41:47.250 --> 41:49.492
and this guy's got nothing on the brute
you beat last week.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.201
Plus I've got three pound resting on this.
Come on.

41:54.958 --> 41:56.290
Do it for Alf, Charlie.

42:01.792 --> 42:03.124
Come on, old boy.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.991
One more like that. Come on.

42:53.625 --> 42:58.074
That's it, Charlie! That's it!
Hey, Jimmy get some water.

42:59.417 --> 43:03.707
Come on, come on.
That's it, Charlie.

43:08.583 --> 43:13.499
You sure I can't tempt you out tonight?
There'll be WAAFs a plenty.

43:14.708 --> 43:16.540
No, I have work to do.

43:18.500 --> 43:19.832
Your loss.

43:23.500 --> 43:26.413
You ready George? The others are outside.

43:26.500 --> 43:27.911
Sure am.

43:33.417 --> 43:34.783
Don't wait up.

43:47.167 --> 43:49.500
George, Kate.

44:03.667 --> 44:05.033
You all right, Kate?

44:05.250 --> 44:06.582
Sorry.

44:06.792 --> 44:07.748
You all right?

44:07.833 --> 44:09.995
Yes, sorry, mind was in another place.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.206
Do you want another drink?

44:12.292 --> 44:14.909
It's just I don't understand
how somebody can be such an arse.

44:15.417 --> 44:16.407
Who?

44:16.500 --> 44:17.832
Lieutenant Miller.

44:17.917 --> 44:20.330
Ah! Douglas.

44:20.625 --> 44:25.495
Yes, I mean I only wanted him to enjoy himself.
That wasn't wrong, was it?

44:25.917 --> 44:29.831
He just finds this whole thing difficult, that's all.
He'll come out of his shell.

44:30.417 --> 44:31.498
Really?

44:31.583 --> 44:35.577
In time, yes.
Fancy another drink?

44:36.000 --> 44:38.492
Perhaps if I try speaking to him again?

44:38.583 --> 44:39.198
Drink?

44:39.292 --> 44:43.332
No... No, maybe I should just leave him be.

44:45.792 --> 44:49.786
Oh, look. There's a pink elephant at the bar.

44:54.083 --> 44:55.665
I might just go and introduce myself.

44:56.625 --> 44:58.287
Okay, George.

45:21.667 --> 45:23.579
How's the bottle going, Reg?

45:25.208 --> 45:26.619
Barely broken the seal, George.

45:28.167 --> 45:29.203
Steady girl.

45:29.292 --> 45:31.705
Oh, shut up, George!
I could drink you under the table.

45:31.833 --> 45:34.746
Ah yes, but then we're not sat
at a table are we?

45:35.000 --> 45:36.491
I will drink you under the bar then.

45:38.000 --> 45:41.164
No room under here.
It's full of George's black market whisky.

45:41.250 --> 45:44.448
Is it now? We'll have to speed up.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.412
And now you want me to guess right.

46:00.667 --> 46:02.078
Do I?

46:02.458 --> 46:04.370
Yes, you sly fox.

46:05.500 --> 46:10.950
Because your right hand
is slightly further forward than your left.

46:11.792 --> 46:13.579
Maybe it's a bluff.

46:15.500 --> 46:17.207
Or a double bluff.

46:21.750 --> 46:23.116
That one...

46:23.417 --> 46:24.498
Oh bugger.

46:25.875 --> 46:28.492
I demand a stewards enquiry!

46:32.083 --> 46:33.369
How did you do that?

46:33.667 --> 46:36.501
Sleight of hand is easy when your audience
is as drunk as a skunk.

46:38.208 --> 46:44.614
I will have you know
that I am as sober as a judge.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.741
Of course you are, Georgie darling.

47:13.167 --> 47:15.875
For some reason I'm in the RAF
and I don't like to salute!

47:15.958 --> 47:17.915
You little cheeky chappie.

47:19.208 --> 47:22.326
Georgie! You shouldn't have!

47:23.292 --> 47:24.499
I didn't.

47:28.083 --> 47:30.575
Hang on a second;
I should have more than this!

47:30.667 --> 47:32.784
Oh yes you did, but I left the barmaid
a really good tip.

47:33.875 --> 47:35.241
I bet you did.

47:42.083 --> 47:43.494
Good evening, sergeant.

47:46.333 --> 47:47.414
Charlie?

47:51.208 --> 47:52.619
Are the others inside?

47:55.417 --> 47:56.658
Charlie?

47:59.500 --> 48:00.707
Fix up, fix up.

48:05.208 --> 48:06.119
Hold him.

48:12.417 --> 48:13.498
He's just had a few too many.

48:15.500 --> 48:19.744
Put him in the back of George's car.
Use this to get a taxi.

48:20.083 --> 48:21.494
Thank you, sir.

48:26.208 --> 48:27.415
Douglas.

48:29.917 --> 48:32.000
You have had far too much to drink.

48:36.417 --> 48:39.251
Just make sure you wipe your feet
before you get in.

48:43.500 --> 48:44.707
Is there enough room for me?

48:51.833 --> 48:55.326
Kate, about the other night.

48:58.208 --> 49:01.906
It's okay, I know you can't help it.

49:10.708 --> 49:13.325
That was very kind of you, by the way.

49:15.125 --> 49:18.823
If he had been sick on my shoes,
I would have left him there.

49:28.208 --> 49:29.619
Christ!

49:46.958 --> 49:48.620
They're as thick as thieves those two.

49:59.792 --> 50:01.533
Good morning, George... Douglas.

50:01.667 --> 50:02.157
Morning.

50:02.250 --> 50:03.240
Good morning, Kate.

50:04.792 --> 50:06.499
Saw you weren't flying today.

50:06.583 --> 50:09.496
No, thank god.
This one doesn't think so though...

50:11.583 --> 50:12.573
That's better.

50:15.500 --> 50:19.073
There's a new Laurel and Hardy playing
at the Ritz this afternoon.

50:29.875 --> 50:32.492
Oh! Well, I'm busy.

50:36.542 --> 50:38.499
I've got to see a man about a dog.

50:44.083 --> 50:45.369
Behave!

51:20.833 --> 51:25.578
I do love Laurel and Hardy. Did you enjoy it?
I didn't hear you laughing much.

51:25.667 --> 51:28.739
I couldn't hear most of it;
the old chap next to me kept snoring.

51:35.167 --> 51:36.157
Afternoon, Kate!

51:36.375 --> 51:37.491
Hello, Patrick.

51:37.792 --> 51:38.748
Enjoy the picture?

51:38.833 --> 51:41.325
I did. No Mrs Fuller with you today?

51:41.417 --> 51:48.699
No, W.I. meeting.
Now listen, Kate, I owe George a pound.

51:49.333 --> 51:54.203
Little wager between gentlemen.
And I was wondering if you could get that to him.

51:57.167 --> 51:58.954
Not a problem.

51:59.208 --> 52:04.249
Funny thing whisky. A couple of single malts
and I will bet on anything.

52:04.833 --> 52:09.407
Two flies on a pork scratching
and mine has to bugger off first.

52:09.500 --> 52:14.575
Oh... I'll err...
I'll make sure he gets it.

52:15.125 --> 52:18.289
Awfully kind of you.
Heading back to base, are we?

52:18.792 --> 52:21.910
No, Flight Lieutenant Miller
is taking me for a drive.

52:27.208 --> 52:29.575
He's a handsome chap, but he's awfully tall.

52:29.708 --> 52:31.370
Yes, awfully tall.

52:31.792 --> 52:33.499
Nice to meet you.

52:34.042 --> 52:36.329
Well take care of this one, she's a good'n.

52:36.458 --> 52:42.284
And sorry about the snoring.
Doris can't stand it either.

52:43.375 --> 52:44.491
Goodbye, Patrick.

52:44.583 --> 52:45.494
Goodbye.

52:45.583 --> 52:46.494
Goodbye.

52:47.917 --> 52:53.743
Here, you can give this to George...
Flies on a pork scratching?

53:03.083 --> 53:05.075
George told me you were a fighter pilot.

53:05.750 --> 53:07.082
I was.

53:07.500 --> 53:09.708
So why did you join Bomber Command?

53:11.708 --> 53:13.199
More leg room!

53:14.708 --> 53:17.041
No, really.

53:17.625 --> 53:18.832
Well why did you join?

53:19.208 --> 53:20.415
My brother.

53:20.542 --> 53:21.498
Your brother?

53:21.583 --> 53:22.164
Yes.

53:22.250 --> 53:24.663
Is he a pilot?

53:24.958 --> 53:29.749
No, he was in the Fusiliers,
he fought at Dunkirk.

53:29.875 --> 53:34.791
He told me that I should join the WAAF;
said it was the right thing to do.

53:34.958 --> 53:37.666
After he died I couldn't just sit at home,

53:37.750 --> 53:39.867
so I followed his advice
and joined up a week later.

53:39.958 --> 53:41.494
I'm sorry.

53:44.917 --> 53:46.499
What was his name?

53:47.083 --> 53:49.496
Colin.

53:49.583 --> 53:52.997
Before the war he was an illustrator
for a local newspaper.

53:53.667 --> 53:57.331
As a boy his room was filled
with little cartoons and sketches.

53:57.500 --> 54:00.288
I think he would have got on well
with my brother.

54:00.583 --> 54:03.496
He was also always scribbling away
at something or other.

54:04.792 --> 54:06.499
Oh, what is his name?

54:09.792 --> 54:11.124
Ron.

54:57.958 --> 54:59.699
I'm so sorry.

55:04.250 --> 55:05.491
Your poor mother.

55:14.292 --> 55:15.658
Fancy a drink?

55:18.500 --> 55:23.165
Depends.
Is Stan Laurel going to be there?

55:24.833 --> 55:26.165
Who?

55:46.917 --> 55:51.662
Huh hum.
Mayfield. Smith.

56:14.625 --> 56:19.416
Evening.
So, how was the film?

56:22.417 --> 56:25.034
Oh... That good, huh?

56:30.208 --> 56:31.039
From Patrick.

56:31.833 --> 56:36.578
Ah, excellent.
Thought the old fella was never going to pay up.

56:39.792 --> 56:42.580
Just remembering the last time
we all went to the pictures.

56:43.625 --> 56:45.742
Ended in disaster.

56:46.333 --> 56:50.282
Well, actually to be honest
it started with disaster.

56:52.875 --> 56:54.832
Alf somehow managed to get himself

56:54.917 --> 56:58.786
locked in a cubical minutes
before the film started.

56:58.917 --> 57:02.706
Anyway, Charlie decides to climb over
and help him you see,

57:02.958 --> 57:05.871
but when he does he lands foot
first into the toilet.

57:05.958 --> 57:07.824
And to make matters worse,
Alf hadn't flushed.

57:07.917 --> 57:10.375
So Charlie's shouting and swearing,

57:10.458 --> 57:13.417
while Alf is trying to crawl out
from underneath the cubical.

57:13.875 --> 57:17.414
My god, he tears a hole
the size of the Western Front in his trousers!

57:17.500 --> 57:22.040
Mummy's boy has gone off to find an usherette
and comes back with that big one. You know,

57:22.167 --> 57:24.409
the one that looks like she's eaten
all the ices.

57:25.500 --> 57:28.823
Well she shoulders the door,
finds Charlie in the drink,

57:28.917 --> 57:31.830
and Alf with his bomb bay doors
open for inspection.

57:33.375 --> 57:36.493
Oh yes.

57:41.208 --> 57:43.541
Chaps didn't let that story go
for quite a while.

58:04.042 --> 58:08.332
What happened, George?
The night Alf died?

58:36.917 --> 58:39.500
We were heading back
over the North Sea from Bremen.

58:42.333 --> 58:46.498
Thought we were home and dry when we got hit
by Night Fighters. It was that quick.

58:49.917 --> 58:52.500
Didn't realise Alf was hit until we landed.

58:56.167 --> 59:01.492
We might have been able to stop the bleeding,
but he said nothing.

59:06.167 --> 59:08.580
I should have known that something was wrong.

59:17.083 --> 59:18.790
I don't know.

59:21.625 --> 59:24.618
Maybe his luck just ran out.

59:49.500 --> 59:50.707
And then I showed up.

59:53.583 --> 59:55.495
And then you showed up. Urgh.

01:00:13.417 --> 01:00:16.581
Oh..! And I thought you didn't drink?

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.790
Not often.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:46.500
So, how goes the investigation?

01:00:47.292 --> 01:00:48.783
What investigation?

01:00:48.917 --> 01:00:53.161
Your investigation into the clandestine activities
of sergeants Mayfield and Smith.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:54.081
Who?

01:00:54.167 --> 01:00:58.912
Oh, oh!
Thomas and Henry! You've noticed them too?

01:00:59.917 --> 01:01:02.079
They do seem to enjoy one another's company.

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:05.250
No, no, it's much more than that.

01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.534
They are up to something.

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:13.205
I think you're going about the whole thing
the wrong way.

01:01:14.333 --> 01:01:15.323
Bollocks!

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:21.746
Okay then. A pound says I can find out
what they're up to before you can.

01:01:26.083 --> 01:01:27.494
You're on.

01:01:36.792 --> 01:01:38.579
Where the hell did you find this?

01:01:39.292 --> 01:01:40.908
I confiscated it.

01:01:43.708 --> 01:01:48.157
Oh the utter, utter bastards!
They're making an absolute fortune.

01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:50.742
How many pairs of boots have they sold?

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:51.618
One.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:52.323
What!?

01:01:52.417 --> 01:01:56.206
They have been selling the same pair of boots
over and over again.

01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:01.073
On the third of March they sold
a pair of flight boots

01:02:01.208 --> 01:02:04.997
to the landlord of the Dog and Duck,
for ten shillings.

01:02:05.917 --> 01:02:08.705
On the eleventh of March
the landlord of the Dog and Duck

01:02:08.792 --> 01:02:10.499
had a visit from the local bobby.

01:02:10.875 --> 01:02:13.583
Who had been made aware
that the unfortunate landlord

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:16.535
was in possession of government property.

01:02:17.167 --> 01:02:22.538
He promptly confiscated the boots
and returned them to our crooked friends,

01:02:22.667 --> 01:02:25.330
in return for the sum of three shillings.

01:02:25.667 --> 01:02:28.125
On the twenty third of March

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:33.496
they sold a pair of boots to dear Mrs...
Well, do I need to carry on?

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.415
That's bloody genius!

01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:37.412
That's bloody criminal!

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.494
What's criminal is that they did not cut me in
on the action.

01:02:46.333 --> 01:02:50.077
Georgie!
You owe me a pound.

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:29.073
George!

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:40.073
George!

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.492
Time to get up.

01:05:03.417 --> 01:05:04.908
What is it?

01:05:06.042 --> 01:05:09.206
It's Henry. He's been signed off by the M.O.

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.286
What!?

01:05:10.417 --> 01:05:13.785
That's not even the worst part.
We've got the Jerry.

01:05:13.917 --> 01:05:14.998
Huh, that's all we need.

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:17.791
Chaps, you all know Schmidt,
Henry's replacement tonight.

01:05:17.875 --> 01:05:19.332
No sausage jokes please, Thomas.

01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:21.833
Oh, don't be a sour kraut, George.

01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.992
Tonight's target
is an industrial complex

01:05:29.083 --> 01:05:30.574
on the outskirts of Berlin.

01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:33.700
You'll be flying down
through northern Germany,

01:05:33.833 --> 01:05:37.622
reaching your target at approximately
twenty-three hundred hours.

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:41.831
We have reports of light cloud cover
over northern Germany and Berlin,

01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:45.493
so you can expect contact
on your inward track.

01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:49.160
Stay alert!
Particularly you, Tail Gunners.

01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:56.623
It's a long flight, I don't want any mistakes.
Take off is at seventeen-thirty hours.

01:05:56.833 --> 01:06:00.702
Squadron Leader Mitchell will talk you
through the route in further detail now,

01:06:00.833 --> 01:06:04.406
before your individual briefings.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:10.497
I cannot stress enough the importance
of this mission.

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:13.541
Good luck.
Stay sharp.

01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:28.031
Fourteen o' six in five, four, three, two, one.

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:11.492
I'll err, see you chaps later.

01:07:29.583 --> 01:07:30.573
No.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.290
Think I'm going to go and get ready.

01:07:46.083 --> 01:07:47.494
How are you feeling Charlie?

01:07:54.042 --> 01:07:55.499
Better.

01:10:47.083 --> 01:10:49.166
Do you have any of those weather reports?

01:10:49.292 --> 01:10:51.784
Yes, this one.

01:11:12.292 --> 01:11:13.954
Douglas.

01:11:20.708 --> 01:11:22.119
I...

01:11:26.208 --> 01:11:27.494
I'm.

01:11:30.667 --> 01:11:34.206
I just want to say... Good luck.

01:11:57.500 --> 01:11:59.492
Goodbye, Kate.

01:15:03.667 --> 01:15:04.657
Coms check.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:06.490
Navigator checking in.

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:08.657
Mid-upper checking in.

01:15:09.542 --> 01:15:10.532
Bomb Aimer checking in.

01:15:11.417 --> 01:15:12.498
Rear Gunner checking in.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:17.540
Flight Engineer checking in.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:19.490
Skipper checking in.

01:17:46.792 --> 01:17:47.782
Fuel check, please.

01:17:52.542 --> 01:17:53.532
Fuel okay.

01:17:55.417 --> 01:17:56.407
Pressure head heater on.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:01.581
Pressure head heater on.

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.991
Flaps at twenty-five degrees.

01:18:09.958 --> 01:18:11.494
Flaps at twenty-five degrees.

01:19:17.583 --> 01:19:22.203
They'll come home safe.
They've got to.

01:19:25.625 --> 01:19:27.617
George owes me ten bob.

01:19:57.708 --> 01:20:00.496
Alter bearing to one two-two, Skipper.

01:20:01.708 --> 01:20:03.791
Roger that, turning onto one two-two.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.492
Lancaster close on port side.

01:20:09.083 --> 01:20:10.073
I see her.

01:20:30.208 --> 01:20:31.494
We're just passing Bremen.

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:38.492
Thank you, Navigator.
Keep your eyes out for Night Fighters.

01:20:58.500 --> 01:20:59.707
Switching to port fuel tank.

01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:02.490
Roger that.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.116
SEVEN O'CLOCK!

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.492
One on you Mid-upper! Ten o'clock!

01:21:22.292 --> 01:21:24.500
Got him!
Right down the middle.

01:21:25.875 --> 01:21:27.332
One o'clock low!

01:21:29.792 --> 01:21:31.124
Eyes on two, five o'clock Mid...

01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.415
Charlie, watch out!

01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:37.743
Charlie?
Are you hit, Charlie?

01:21:39.042 --> 01:21:40.499
Eleven o'clock.

01:21:42.167 --> 01:21:43.499
Charlie, say something.

01:21:44.083 --> 01:21:45.449
Nose Gunner, two o'clock!

01:21:51.708 --> 01:21:53.290
We've lost Charlie.

01:21:54.625 --> 01:21:55.615
Four o'clock low.

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.615
George.

01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:58.789
Report Charlie! Report!

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:02.407
Three o'clock!

01:22:05.958 --> 01:22:07.665
Can you see anything, Mid-Upper?

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:10.616
No, nothing.

01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:13.782
Two o'clock!

01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:17.408
He's coming for you, Mid-Upper.

01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:23.703
George!

01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:24.908
Lanc above, Skipper.

01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:28.490
Five o'clock low.

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:34.700
George! George!
HE IS GONE!

01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:37.287
Here comes another one, two o'clock!

01:22:40.792 --> 01:22:42.499
He's coming for you, Nose Gunner.

01:22:44.667 --> 01:22:45.657
Eleven o'clock high.

01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:52.782
Ten o'clock high!

01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:57.824
Charlie, if you are still alive back there,
pull yourself together and start firing.

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:02.916
There's one left out there.
He's coming back around.

01:23:04.542 --> 01:23:06.499
Eleven o'clock, here he comes!

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:27.283
Got him.

01:23:28.792 --> 01:23:30.658
Nice to see you're back with us, Rear Gunner.

01:23:36.792 --> 01:23:38.499
How's she feeling?

01:23:40.542 --> 01:23:41.828
She's a bit twitchy.

01:23:44.167 --> 01:23:45.783
Do you want me to plot a course home, Skipper?

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:05.493
Stay on course, we're not going back now.

01:24:07.917 --> 01:24:09.499
Roger that.

01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:35.242
Three minutes thirty seconds to target.

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:41.199
What's the air speed, Navigator?

01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:43.495
One three five.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.332
Bombs fused.

01:25:00.083 --> 01:25:01.199
Thank you, Bombardier.

01:25:06.125 --> 01:25:07.366
Do you see any chutes?

01:25:10.292 --> 01:25:11.282
One!

01:25:20.292 --> 01:25:21.703
Just one.

01:25:22.792 --> 01:25:24.283
What's our bearing, Navigator?

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.787
One four one.

01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:29.790
On one four one.

01:25:30.917 --> 01:25:35.491
Airspeed one three five.
Two minutes.

01:25:37.417 --> 01:25:41.036
Keep weaving, Skipper.
Keep weaving.

01:25:43.417 --> 01:25:45.079
Okay, Bombardier.

01:25:47.458 --> 01:25:49.495
Engineer, could you bring our revs up, please?

01:25:54.292 --> 01:25:55.749
One minute forty seconds.

01:25:59.500 --> 01:26:00.832
Bomb doors open.

01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:10.411
Bomb doors open.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.492
One minute twenty seconds.

01:26:14.417 --> 01:26:15.908
Straight and level now, Skipper.

01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:23.493
Left. Left.

01:26:27.417 --> 01:26:28.498
Steady.

01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:36.494
One minute. One minute to go.

01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:50.490
Forty seconds.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.491
Bombs away.

01:27:11.792 --> 01:27:12.953
Bombs gone.

01:27:20.500 --> 01:27:23.083
Bomb doors closed.
New course please, Navigator.

01:27:24.292 --> 01:27:26.284
Turn on to two one five, Skipper.

01:27:27.333 --> 01:27:29.074
Two one five, roger.

01:27:32.833 --> 01:27:34.495
It's a direct hit.

01:27:38.417 --> 01:27:39.749
Good job, boys.

01:27:52.583 --> 01:27:54.495
Shutting down number four engine.

01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.492
Wireless Operator, open up coms please.

01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:04.491
James is hit.

01:28:41.125 --> 01:28:42.491
He'll be fine.

01:28:53.875 --> 01:28:55.082
Coms open.

01:28:55.292 --> 01:28:59.411
This is B for Baker.
Our starboard outer engine has been hit.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.493
Repeat starboard outer hit.
Breaking formation.

01:29:09.417 --> 01:29:12.489
Thomas! Take over navigation.

01:29:20.208 --> 01:29:23.497
Keep pressure here... Jim!

01:29:27.417 --> 01:29:28.578
I'll be right back.

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:24.412
We're back over Blighty, chaps.

01:30:26.292 --> 01:30:27.749
Did you hear that, James?

01:30:31.417 --> 01:30:32.953
We're nearly home.

01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:50.245
Put your chutes on and get ready to bail.

01:31:05.500 --> 01:31:06.581
What is it, Douglas?

01:31:08.375 --> 01:31:13.495
I can't guarantee that I can put her down safely.
Get ready to bail, that's an order.

01:31:13.667 --> 01:31:14.578
Douglas!

01:31:14.667 --> 01:31:17.080
Well you better come down here
and throw me out yourself then Skipper.

01:31:32.167 --> 01:31:34.580
You just can't help
but grow attached to the buggers.

01:32:17.667 --> 01:32:19.954
Down, bolted, two greens.

01:32:21.500 --> 01:32:22.490
Brakes.

01:32:23.708 --> 01:32:24.698

Good pressure. Zero at the wheels.

01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:36.411
Roger.

01:33:18.708 --> 01:33:20.700
On a wing and a prayer.

01:33:32.875 --> 01:33:34.787
Knights of the air.
