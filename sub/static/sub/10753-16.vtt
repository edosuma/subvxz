00:07.595 --> 00:09.347
(Man on phone)

00:09.598 --> 00:12.431
'I've tried diet after diet

00:12.729 --> 00:18.247
'from milk shakes three times a day
to that lady on TV. Nothing works.'

00:18.655 --> 00:23.206
Hank, listen.
You've got to look inside yourself.

00:23.580 --> 00:26.140
Part of you isn't being fed.

00:26.418 --> 00:28.329
'It certainly isn't my butt.'

00:30.341 --> 00:35.131
I'm talking about your inner self.
What isn't being fed there?

00:35.516 --> 00:39.714
Love? Career? Simple self-esteem?
These are deep issues.

00:40.066 --> 00:43.979
- 'So what do I do?'
- I'd suggest therapy.

00:44.323 --> 00:48.111
Stay on the line
and my producer will help you.

00:48.454 --> 00:50.445
Roz, who's next?

00:50.708 --> 00:53.586
We have someone who disagrees
with your advice to Hank.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.678
Oh, really?
Hello, you're on the line.

00:56.968 --> 01:00.483
(Lilith) 'Congratulations, Frasier,
you've done it again.'

01:09.864 --> 01:11.775
'You've led another
unsuspecting innocent

01:12.035 --> 01:14.913
'down one of your dark,
Freudian hallways.'

01:18.087 --> 01:20.237
Lilith?

01:20.507 --> 01:24.978
'Overeating is a behavioural problem
caused by negative reinforcement.

01:25.348 --> 01:28.260
'It can be cured
by behaviour modification.'

01:28.563 --> 01:33.353
Seattle, we have a celebrity
of sorts on the line.

01:33.738 --> 01:35.694
This is my ex-wife Lilith.

01:35.949 --> 01:37.905
'What do you mean by celebrity?'

01:38.162 --> 01:40.232
Oh, they know you.

01:43.879 --> 01:46.598
Roz, what does "call screening" mean?

01:46.884 --> 01:49.273
I put on the air the calls I wanna hear.

01:52.226 --> 01:55.502
Lilith, what brings you to Seattle?
The constant rain?

01:56.567 --> 01:59.957
'I'm here for a convention
and I heard you on the radio.

02:00.281 --> 02:03.239
'l hoped you'd introduce
Pearl Jam's latest hit,

02:03.536 --> 02:07.085
'but you were doling out
worthless advice pellets

02:07.502 --> 02:11.017
'from your psychiatric Pez dispenser.'

02:13.220 --> 02:16.098
I guess you'll be rushing off
to your convention.

02:16.391 --> 02:18.507
We'll catch up on your next trip.

02:18.770 --> 02:20.806
'I'm not doing anything
for dinner tonight.'

02:22.610 --> 02:27.684
Then you'll want to keep tuned to 780
for Gil Chesterton's restaurant beat.

02:28.077 --> 02:31.672
Why don't you ask her to dinner,
Dr Crane?

02:35.172 --> 02:39.723
What a wonderful idea.
Let me tell you why, Seattle.

02:40.097 --> 02:42.167
Although our marriage
was unsuccessful,

02:42.434 --> 02:46.552
Lilith and I are capable
of behaving as adults

02:46.899 --> 02:50.938
and even enjoying spending
some time together from time to time.

02:51.282 --> 02:56.072
- So, 7.00 at my place?
- 'Sounds great.'

03:05.263 --> 03:09.381
In my day, when people broke up
you hated each other.

03:09.729 --> 03:13.085
What happened
to the sanctity of divorce?

03:13.402 --> 03:16.633
- Dad, you never liked Lilith.
- She's weird.

03:19.244 --> 03:22.554
- She is not weird.
- Oh, she's weird.

03:24.128 --> 03:26.198
Well, maybe she's a little strange.

03:26.465 --> 03:30.140
No. Maris is a little strange.
Lilith is weird.

03:30.472 --> 03:33.703
Gee, Dad. I had no idea
you preferred my wife to Frasier's.

03:36.398 --> 03:38.389
Oh, my head!

03:38.652 --> 03:41.530
- Can I get you an aspirin, Daphne?
- No, those are useless.

03:41.824 --> 03:46.534
This is one of my psychic headaches.
There's some kind of negative force.

03:46.915 --> 03:50.510
I get these when there's
a clawing at the cosmic continuum.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.989
Perhaps if someone
rubbed your temples...

03:53.260 --> 03:55.137
Niles!

03:57.057 --> 04:00.208
I'm sure she wants privacy
while she contacts the mother ship.

04:04.987 --> 04:09.185
Frasier, I'm here for support
but I will not speak to Lilith.

04:09.536 --> 04:14.087
This feud between you and Lilith
is ridiculous. Let it go.

04:14.460 --> 04:18.373
- I can't recall what the fight was about.
- Let me refresh you.

04:21.180 --> 04:24.491
At our wedding
while Maris was reciting her vows -

04:24.811 --> 04:27.803
vows of love - I heard snickering.

04:30.362 --> 04:34.480
I saw Lilith, fingers pressed against
her lips, body shaking like a paint mixer.

04:34.828 --> 04:36.546
(Doorbell)

04:36.789 --> 04:39.303
Now there she is.

04:39.586 --> 04:43.181
It's just one evening.
Will you at least try to be civil?

04:43.508 --> 04:45.976
All right, but I refuse to be warm.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.184
- Hello, Lilith.
- Frasier

04:56.447 --> 04:58.563
Please come in.

05:03.708 --> 05:07.383
- Let me take these things for you.
- Thank you.

05:07.715 --> 05:10.548
- Look who's here.
- Hello, Martin. Hello, Niles.

05:10.845 --> 05:12.801
(Both) Hello.

05:14.936 --> 05:18.087
- Where's Maris?
-Visiting her sister in Chicago.

05:18.400 --> 05:23.997
I thought perhaps she was sailing
up the transplendent river of your love.

05:28.709 --> 05:32.668
Frasier, I like your apartment.
You have some beautiful things.

05:33.007 --> 05:35.567
The settlement is final, Lilith.

05:40.853 --> 05:43.242
Go away.

05:45.778 --> 05:47.973
Why does he listen to you and not me?

05:48.240 --> 05:51.277
The tone of my voice means business.

05:51.579 --> 05:54.298
Your voice
is more commanding than mine?

05:54.584 --> 05:57.974
Hell, I took a half a step before
I realized she was talking to the dog.

06:10.694 --> 06:13.970
Oh, my Lord.
I've never had a throbbing like this.

06:14.283 --> 06:17.434
Daphne, this is my ex-wife,
Dr Lilith Sternin.

06:17.747 --> 06:21.740
Lilith, this is Daphne Moon,
Dad's physical therapist.

06:22.088 --> 06:24.761
- Nice to meet you.
- An equal pleasure.

06:25.051 --> 06:28.441
When I shook hands
I lost all feeling in me arm.

06:31.938 --> 06:34.088
Frasier, I'm going to use the phone.

06:34.358 --> 06:37.873
Maris has a cold.
I want to be sure she's taking liquids.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.712
Isn't it enough
that she's eternally sipping

06:40.994 --> 06:43.508
from the font
of your perpetual adoration?

06:50.760 --> 06:53.991
Martin, I'm especially delighted
to see you here tonight.

06:54.308 --> 06:56.060
Oh, yeah?

06:56.311 --> 06:59.428
Knowing the history
of your relationship with Frasier,

06:59.734 --> 07:01.804
when I'd heard he'd taken you in

07:02.070 --> 07:05.346
I flipped to the weather channel
to see if hell had frozen over.

07:08.080 --> 07:11.356
Frasier, how did you ever
let this little peach get away?

07:15.801 --> 07:19.476
Dinner is nearly ready.
Let's move to the table.

07:19.808 --> 07:22.242
Lilith, how is Frederick?

07:22.520 --> 07:26.718
I've enrolled him in a chess camp.
It's really quite stimulating.

07:27.070 --> 07:30.824
For eight hours a day
he sits with 300 other children

07:31.160 --> 07:33.628
mastering the Alhausen-Grob opening.

07:33.915 --> 07:36.793
Shouldn't he be out in the fresh air?

07:37.087 --> 07:39.078
Every day they go for a nature walk.

07:40.050 --> 07:43.804
Unfortunately, Frederick is allergic
to seven varieties of ivy

07:44.139 --> 07:47.336
so he wears long sleeves
and long pants,

07:47.646 --> 07:49.602
a bonnet with a net on it.

07:51.694 --> 07:54.128
I hope the others don't make fun of him.

07:54.407 --> 07:58.685
I'm sure they don't.
You know how kind kids can be (!)

07:59.039 --> 08:02.714
All he needs is a birthmark on his
face and they'd beat him to death.

08:08.596 --> 08:10.791
I chased him down an alley,

08:11.059 --> 08:15.655
then he pulled a knife so I gave
him a few shots from my night stick.

08:16.026 --> 08:18.096
Fascinating.

08:18.363 --> 08:21.321
Were you at all aware
of any repressed sexual urges

08:21.618 --> 08:25.452
while you were pummelling him
so mercilessly?

08:26.752 --> 08:29.266
Yeah, but I didn't put them in the report.

08:32.010 --> 08:34.650
You're having fun at my expense.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.886
Not much.

08:38.313 --> 08:41.510
- In fact, I'm going to bed. Good night.
- Good night, Dad.

08:41.818 --> 08:44.935
If you don't need me
I'll be shuffling off, too.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.992
Good night.

08:47.243 --> 08:51.634
It was a pleasure meeting you.
How long are you staying in Seattle?

08:52.002 --> 08:54.038
Just the weekend.

08:54.297 --> 08:58.336
Enjoy your stay.
I'll be dead by Saturday night.

08:59.973 --> 09:03.045
I'll say my goodbyes as well.

09:05.565 --> 09:07.874
Good night, Frasier.

09:08.153 --> 09:10.621
This is ridiculous!

09:10.908 --> 09:15.265
Lilith, listen, Niles is upset because
you snickered at Maris' wedding vows.

09:16.500 --> 09:20.652
I responded with a spontaneous
emotion I was feeling at the time.

09:21.968 --> 09:25.677
But if Niles is not mature enough
to accept that,

09:26.016 --> 09:31.648
if he is so pitifully insecure,
if he is in such need of validation,

09:32.068 --> 09:34.536
then for some sense
of familial harmony,

09:34.822 --> 09:37.017
I do apologize.

09:38.287 --> 09:42.075
Oh, Lilith, thank you! Thank you!

09:42.418 --> 09:45.649
This bad blood between us
has gone on too long.

09:47.217 --> 09:51.415
Next time you're in town,
we'll have dinner - just you and me.

09:54.063 --> 09:57.135
He doesn't get that kind
of validation at home, you see.

10:01.533 --> 10:04.684
Well... It's just the two of us.

10:05.916 --> 10:09.431
For the first time since the lawyers
put us in that room and said,

10:09.755 --> 10:11.905
"Don't come out
until there's some resolution."

10:15.765 --> 10:18.962
Yes, well... This was nice.

10:20.356 --> 10:22.506
Yes, it was, wasn't it?

10:25.656 --> 10:28.170
You have a beautiful view.

10:28.452 --> 10:30.408
It's a beautiful city.

10:30.665 --> 10:33.259
I hope you enjoy your convention.

10:34.462 --> 10:37.772
For God's sake, Frasier,
there is no convention!

10:38.093 --> 10:40.891
- I'm here because of the letter.
- What letter?

10:42.058 --> 10:44.447
You know very well what letter.

10:44.729 --> 10:48.563
The one you left last month
when you visited Frederick,

10:48.903 --> 10:51.292
proposing we get back together.

10:51.574 --> 10:53.690
Surely you didn't forget.

10:53.953 --> 10:58.708
"My darling, how could a love
like ours fall so far from grace?

10:59.086 --> 11:03.955
"Part of your heart must still
resound to the rhythm of my own.

11:04.345 --> 11:06.620
"I'll be lost without you.

11:06.891 --> 11:10.566
"As long as we have love,
love will keep us together."

11:12.567 --> 11:15.525
Aside from the shameless pilfering
from the Captain and Tennille,

11:15.822 --> 11:18.620
I was moved by your entreaty.

11:20.330 --> 11:25.450
I felt the same, yet I needed to
pretend to come for a convention

11:25.839 --> 11:29.912
because I was still
unable to commit myself.

11:31.723 --> 11:34.999
But... seeing you now,

11:35.313 --> 11:37.304
I realize how much I've missed you

11:42.658 --> 11:47.448
Lilith, I did write that letter
and I did leave it in the apartment but...

11:49.002 --> 11:50.993
Yes?

11:51.256 --> 11:54.612
It wasn't last month.
It was nearly a year ago.

11:54.928 --> 11:58.284
It was before I moved to Seattle.
You just found it now?

11:59.895 --> 12:02.090
It had fallen behind the dresser.

12:02.357 --> 12:06.794
The cleaning service
is doing its usual bang-up job (!)

12:07.157 --> 12:10.035
- Don't I feel like the perfect fool?
- Listen, Lilith...

12:10.328 --> 12:13.718
I am humiliated, emotionally drained

12:14.043 --> 12:17.479
and I've used up
all my frequent-flyer miles.

12:17.799 --> 12:20.836
Lilith, please...
- There's nothing else to say.

12:21.138 --> 12:24.687
I'd like to leave
with at least a shred of dignity.

12:40.754 --> 12:43.427
(Doorbell)

12:49.143 --> 12:51.452
Thank you.

12:53.441 --> 12:56.911
I wrote this letter
just before I came to Seattle

12:57.240 --> 13:01.358
hoping for a reconciliation.
She only just found it.

13:01.705 --> 13:03.935
Didn't Captain and Tennille sing this?

13:04.209 --> 13:06.484
Like they own those five words!

13:08.216 --> 13:11.811
I got over her, I moved out here,

13:12.139 --> 13:15.688
she comes back and I wonder
if I made the right decision.

13:16.062 --> 13:18.622
I did write that letter.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.289
You have come
to some sort of crossroads.

13:21.572 --> 13:25.850
That's a tidy little way
of saying I'm in hell.

13:28.499 --> 13:31.138
Niles, my life suits me,

13:31.421 --> 13:34.493
yet I wonder if there is
a chance for reconciliation,

13:34.801 --> 13:38.589
if it's worth exploring
the feelings that I'm feeling.

13:40.728 --> 13:42.958
Should I see her tonight?

13:44.651 --> 13:49.247
Like most patients
you know the answer to your question.

13:49.618 --> 13:53.497
You want me to support you
whether I share your opinion or not.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.744
- I don't have an opinion.
- You do.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.517
- But I don't.
- Then I can't help you.

14:03.224 --> 14:05.863
All right. All right.

14:06.145 --> 14:10.343
In my soul, I'm leaning
toward taking the next step

14:10.694 --> 14:14.004
and seeing if there's anything...there.

14:14.325 --> 14:16.714
- That is what you should do.
- Why?

14:16.996 --> 14:19.066
- You know why.
- Damn it, Niles!

14:19.333 --> 14:22.291
Frasier, you know why.

14:23.632 --> 14:25.509
All right.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.675
We have a long history together.
We have a son we both adore.

14:31.061 --> 14:35.134
There were some good times,
and when they were good, whoo-wa!

14:37.488 --> 14:40.366
Our minds are pretty well made up.

14:40.660 --> 14:44.255
Thank you, Niles.
I don't know what I'd do without you.

14:44.584 --> 14:46.734
- Yes, you do.
- Drop it!

14:52.555 --> 14:54.591
(Knock at door)

15:00.234 --> 15:02.589
- Hello, Lilith.
- Frasier, come in.

15:03.740 --> 15:06.459
I must be early.
You haven't put up your hair.

15:06.745 --> 15:11.102
- I thought I'd leave it down.
- Really?

15:12.128 --> 15:16.406
After several hours of deliberation
and weighing the consequences,

15:16.762 --> 15:19.560
I decided to be playful.

15:22.479 --> 15:24.947
I'm glad you invited me to dinner.

15:25.233 --> 15:28.828
How could I not?
I felt so awful about last night.

15:29.157 --> 15:32.991
I thought you'd read the letter
long ago and ignored it.

15:33.330 --> 15:37.482
No explanation necessary.
It was a simple misunderstanding.

15:37.837 --> 15:40.670
Well,
I know a great little French bistro...

15:40.968 --> 15:43.766
Frasier, before we go anywhere,

15:44.056 --> 15:48.652
I'd like to go on record as saying
that, regardless of everything,

15:49.022 --> 15:52.298
I respect you for getting on
with your life so successfully.

15:54.073 --> 15:57.622
I feel the same way about you.

15:57.954 --> 16:01.913
Frederick is flourishing
and that's in no small part due to you.

16:02.253 --> 16:05.689
Thank you.
That means a great deal to me.

16:06.885 --> 16:11.003
That's the first pleasant thing we've
said to each other in almost a year.

16:11.351 --> 16:16.823
- You're right.
- You know, I'm suddenly quite moved.

16:18.947 --> 16:21.780
I am, too.

16:23.371 --> 16:27.410
Would it be a dreadful contretemps
if I kissed you right now?

16:27.754 --> 16:30.222
You can always try.

16:43.529 --> 16:45.520
You wanna bag dinner?

16:45.783 --> 16:49.173
There's a bed and an honour bar.
What more do we need?

16:49.498 --> 16:53.969
- Come to me, my white-hot flame.
- I was insane to divorce you.

16:54.339 --> 16:56.295
You're in my thoughts
every waking hour.

16:56.550 --> 17:00.225
- You're the only man I've ever loved.
- So are you.

17:30.565 --> 17:32.521
Good morning.

17:33.863 --> 17:36.900
Jolly good morning to you, too.

17:37.201 --> 17:39.954
I could stay like this all morning.

17:40.248 --> 17:42.557
Me too.

17:44.296 --> 17:48.494
- I'm so glad I flew here to be with you.
- Yes, me too.

17:49.555 --> 17:51.147
(Knock at door)

17:51.391 --> 17:53.825
I'll get that.

17:54.104 --> 17:57.699
It must be the breakfast we ordered
last night. I am famished.

17:58.027 --> 18:00.416
You should be. You were a busy boy.

18:06.666 --> 18:09.419
- Good morning, sir.
- Just bring it in.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.432
Here's something for you too.

18:12.718 --> 18:15.710
Thank you. Good day.

18:17.434 --> 18:22.827
Funny how life takes
its little turns, isn't it?

18:23.236 --> 18:28.230
Yesterday when I woke up I never
imagined I'd wake up here today.

18:28.619 --> 18:30.575
Indeed.

18:32.501 --> 18:37.211
We weren't overly impulsive,
we weren't wrong. It's just...

18:37.592 --> 18:41.710
- This is a mistake.
- Thank God you said that!

18:42.058 --> 18:44.652
Last night was enjoyable
but who are we kidding?

18:44.938 --> 18:50.729
We've gotten on with our lives.
I've got a new set of friends.

18:51.157 --> 18:53.352
For the first time in years I'm happy.

18:53.618 --> 18:57.406
Getting back together
is the stupidest thing we could do.

18:58.836 --> 19:01.908
I meant the eggs.
I ordered poached, not fried.

19:04.971 --> 19:08.327
Well, you didn't let me finish.
You see, um...

19:09.729 --> 19:11.799
After I play devil's advocate, I...

19:12.065 --> 19:15.660
Oh, Frasier. Don't insult me.
That's how you really feel, isn't it?

19:18.201 --> 19:20.112
I'm afraid so.

19:22.041 --> 19:24.396
Oh, Lilith, are you crying?

19:25.588 --> 19:27.624
God, I'm sorry.

19:27.884 --> 19:32.241
Once again, I've led you down
an emotional primrose path.

19:33.894 --> 19:37.523
Lilith... I never meant to hurt you.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.784
I don't blame you if you're mad at me.

19:42.074 --> 19:45.464
I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at me.

19:46.665 --> 19:49.862
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

19:50.170 --> 19:52.126
I've been so lonely,

19:52.383 --> 19:55.978
and your letter was like a life preserver.

19:57.850 --> 20:00.922
I'm raising a child alone.

20:01.230 --> 20:03.824
I'm scared.

20:04.110 --> 20:07.546
I've always thought of myself
as a strong person,

20:07.867 --> 20:09.778
but the truth is, I'm afraid.

20:10.036 --> 20:13.995
That's why I convinced myself
I was still in love with you.

20:14.335 --> 20:16.166
You mean you're not?

20:16.422 --> 20:19.175
No. I'm not.

20:22.182 --> 20:26.175
Good. So what happened was
because you were lonely and I was...

20:26.522 --> 20:28.399
We all know what you were, Frasier.

20:32.365 --> 20:34.560
(Sobs)

20:34.827 --> 20:37.580
Oh, Lilith. Lilith, here. Here.
Come with me.

20:38.834 --> 20:42.270
Look in there. Tell me what you see.

20:43.383 --> 20:48.173
I'll tell you what I see...
the same strong-willed,

20:48.558 --> 20:51.516
dynamic, intelligent woman
I married seven years ago.

20:51.814 --> 20:55.409
You're suffering a temporary lapse.
Divorce does that to you.

20:57.824 --> 21:02.102
I won't say anything as trite
as someday you'll find someone,

21:02.456 --> 21:06.165
but I know this.
I know you.

21:06.505 --> 21:11.579
I know that no matter what
the future holds, you'll handle it.

21:16.354 --> 21:18.231
Thank you, Frasier.

21:18.482 --> 21:20.518
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

21:20.778 --> 21:22.734
OK.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.522
You always knew
how to buck me up when I was blue.

21:27.832 --> 21:30.949
You've helped me
through some hard times yourself.

21:31.254 --> 21:35.167
Those married years weren't all bad.
We did have some good moments.

21:35.511 --> 21:37.467
The best one was Frederick.

21:39.309 --> 21:41.459
We'll always have that.

21:43.816 --> 21:48.526
And you know, even though
we're not in love any more,

21:49.784 --> 21:52.935
you were always
the most exciting lover I ever had.

21:53.248 --> 21:56.126
In your heart of hearts
you'd say the same about me.

22:03.097 --> 22:06.089
They screwed up the toast, too.
I ordered rye.

22:06.395 --> 22:08.989
Lilith.

22:13.323 --> 22:18.841
# Hey, baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:19.250 --> 22:20.319
# Oh, my!

22:20.794 --> 22:25.310
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

22:27.638 --> 22:32.507
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salad and scrambled eggs

22:32.897 --> 22:34.853
# They're calling again #

22:35.109 --> 22:36.747
Good night!

22:37.305 --> 22:43.222
