WEBVTT

00:33.618 --> 00:36.079
Zindy, my darling,
I can't believe

00:36.204 --> 00:38.623
we're finally going
to meet in person.

00:38.748 --> 00:42.794
It won't be long, Johnny cakes.
My space bus gets in at 4:30.

00:42.877 --> 00:46.631
Just in time for the all-you-can-stand
buffet at Chizzler.

00:46.965 --> 00:49.634
See you soon.

00:50.802 --> 00:52.136
ALL: Ew!

00:53.388 --> 00:55.431
Zoidberg, what is that?

00:55.515 --> 00:57.892
That is the delightful
creature I've been

00:58.017 --> 01:00.395
video dating for
the past four years.

01:00.478 --> 01:01.521
Hit it With a stick!

01:01.604 --> 01:03.731
Tonight is
a dream come true,

01:03.815 --> 01:07.610
a real, live date in a
physical place that exists.

01:07.694 --> 01:11.781
I just have to go straighten up
in case we end up at my place.

01:17.412 --> 01:22.041
There. My home's all clean
except for one part, the inside.

01:22.125 --> 01:26.087
Aww. I'm sure it's fine by the
standards of a gross alien monster.

01:26.170 --> 01:27.213
(SCREAMS)

01:27.672 --> 01:28.673
Nope.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.925
Step aside, people.
I got bug bombs.

01:32.677 --> 01:36.139
Bender, wait. Won't the bugs just
run out and infest someplace else?

01:36.222 --> 01:37.265
Like, our building?

01:37.348 --> 01:38.349
Not my problem.

01:38.433 --> 01:41.269
Fire in the hole!
(CACKLING)

01:43.646 --> 01:45.148

01:56.993 --> 01:58.745
(SIGHS)
(APPLAUSE)

01:59.871 --> 02:01.581
Amazing.

02:01.664 --> 02:05.126
You move like a young,
roach-infested Gene Kelly.

02:05.209 --> 02:07.420
Oh, my God. It's Randy!

02:07.503 --> 02:08.503
Damn right!

02:08.588 --> 02:10.715
And I'm organizing
a tap-dance contest

02:10.798 --> 02:12.425
for the Parks
and Rec Department.

02:12.508 --> 02:15.595
If you don't enter,
I'll just kill myself, okay?

02:15.678 --> 02:17.263
Okay.
No. Wait.

02:17.347 --> 02:21.142
Me? Lil' 0l' Bender?
In a dance contest?

02:21.225 --> 02:22.602
It's a way for
the community to...

02:22.727 --> 02:25.938
At last, a chance to realize
my brand-new dream

02:26.022 --> 02:29.984
of being the greatest tap
dancer in all the world.

02:30.068 --> 02:31.819
Well, in a three-block radius.

02:31.903 --> 02:33.988
Of all time!

02:38.910 --> 02:40.161
(HUMMING)

02:42.497 --> 02:43.790
Greetings, merchant!

02:43.873 --> 02:45.416
I need something
beautiful and cheap

02:45.500 --> 02:47.460
for a lady who is
one of those things.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.756
The cheapest thing I have is
a bouquet of daisies for $6.

02:51.881 --> 02:55.218
Perfect! I'll take half
a bouquet of daisies for $3.

02:59.681 --> 03:01.933
(STRAINING)

03:02.016 --> 03:04.185
These flower shears
are so dull,

03:04.268 --> 03:07.146
and I'm already in debt to
every knife sharpener in town.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.856
Allow me.

03:09.190 --> 03:13.903
Oh! Thank you! That girlfriend
of yours is one lucky lady.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.823
I'm gonna snip
her off her feet!

03:30.586 --> 03:31.671
Zindy!

03:31.754 --> 03:34.424
You're even more beautiful
from a distance!

03:34.507 --> 03:36.134
Johnny cakes!

03:41.013 --> 03:42.056
(SNIFFS)

03:42.140 --> 03:44.684
Good God! What's that
horrible stench?

03:44.809 --> 03:45.893
Stench... Uh...

03:45.977 --> 03:48.479
It's probably this
stinky bus station maybe.

03:48.563 --> 03:53.192
Come. Let's go someplace well
ventilated and grow old together.

03:55.486 --> 03:58.197
(INHALES) Ah... Much better.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.365
(SNIFFS)

03:59.449 --> 04:01.534
(WRETCHES)
It's even worse!

04:01.617 --> 04:04.287
It's like Comic-Con
in a submarine!

04:04.370 --> 04:06.372
(SNIFFING)

04:06.914 --> 04:09.542
Oh, my God!
The smell's coming from you!

04:09.667 --> 04:12.545
What? That?
That's just my personal musk.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.757
You'll learn to love it.
I know I did.

04:16.382 --> 04:19.010
I'm sorry, Zoidberg.
I can't see you anymore.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.511
Something's come up.

04:20.595 --> 04:22.513
It's vomit!

04:31.689 --> 04:34.442
I'd like to return
these for a refund.

04:34.525 --> 04:38.112
Don't worry.
They're (SNIFFLES) unused.

04:38.196 --> 04:39.489
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:39.572 --> 04:42.450
I get so little business
I can't afford refunds.

04:42.533 --> 04:45.161
I don't know what's wrong
with this location.

04:46.871 --> 04:50.249
I understand. (SNIFFLING)

04:50.750 --> 04:54.462
Please don't cry. I can't stand
to see a living thing feel pain.

04:54.545 --> 04:56.839
You are a living thing.
Right?

04:57.882 --> 04:58.883
Uh-huh.

04:59.050 --> 05:00.927
Can I have a refund now?

05:02.887 --> 05:04.722
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)
Ah!

05:04.806 --> 05:06.224
This here's a bayonet.

05:06.307 --> 05:09.477
It's some kind of
kooky half gun, half knife.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.687
Now empty out the register!

05:11.771 --> 05:15.942
And no bag, please.
I care about the environment.

05:16.150 --> 05:19.153
I have $3 in moldy pennies.
It's all yours.

05:19.237 --> 05:20.446
That's generous of you.

05:20.571 --> 05:22.698
Oh, no, you don't,
Mr. Big Jerk!

05:22.782 --> 05:25.660
I have nothing to live for,
so I don't mind telling you,

05:25.743 --> 05:27.537
those pennies are mine.

05:27.620 --> 05:31.624
Don't you get it?
I'm crazy!

05:31.707 --> 05:33.251
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

05:33.334 --> 05:35.920
Go ahead! I don't care
what happens anymore.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.172
Do it. Bash my head in.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.092
(COUGHS) Wha...

05:41.175 --> 05:43.344
What is that? Mustard gas?

05:43.427 --> 05:46.848
That ain't legal. Ain't you
heard of no Geneva Convention?

05:46.931 --> 05:49.517
(SCREAMING)

05:49.600 --> 05:52.562
(GASPS) That was amazing.

05:52.645 --> 05:55.022
Oh, you were
so brave and frugal.

05:55.106 --> 05:56.607
I'm sorry. Don't hit me.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.360
Ooh!

05:59.443 --> 06:01.237
I like the way you hit!

06:01.320 --> 06:02.405
But I don't get it.

06:02.488 --> 06:06.200
Most women I've met can't even stand
next to rne without collapsing.

06:06.284 --> 06:07.952
What's wrong with those women?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.413
Well, some of them
didn't have legs.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.498
But it's not them. It's me.

06:12.623 --> 06:14.625
How do I put this delicately?

06:14.709 --> 06:17.879
I'm smellier than
a whorehouse's outhouse!

06:17.962 --> 06:19.881
That's terribly vivid.

06:19.964 --> 06:23.843
Doesn't matter to rne though, I
was born with no sense of smell.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.013
Really?

06:27.138 --> 06:28.723
My name's Marianne.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.474
Hello, you!

06:30.683 --> 06:32.602
(ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING)

06:50.828 --> 06:52.204
I like your dumpster.

06:52.288 --> 06:56.417
Thank you. The previous tenant
was a very prominent raccoon.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.543
I remember.

06:57.627 --> 07:00.588
Too bad he got partially run
over by that steamroller.

07:00.671 --> 07:02.214
Can I kiss you?

07:04.884 --> 07:08.304
First, let me pinch myself to
make sure I'm not dreaming!

07:08.804 --> 07:09.805
Ouch!

07:09.889 --> 07:12.350
I forgot I was a giant crab!

07:18.356 --> 07:19.607
Welcome, fans!

07:19.690 --> 07:22.610
I'm Randy, coordinator of
this Tap-Danoe-A-Palooza.

07:22.693 --> 07:25.154
Whoo-hoo! Randy!

07:25.237 --> 07:26.614
After weeks of searching,

07:26.697 --> 07:30.993
I'm proud to introduce the five
people willing to participate.

07:31.077 --> 07:33.371
Tonya, Bender, Greg,

07:33.496 --> 07:36.499
some kind of blob monster,
and Petunia!

07:37.541 --> 07:40.419
The extra clicking you'll
hear is gonna be my hip.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.923
FYI, this little lady
has a heart condition.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.591
She's always stealing them!

07:45.675 --> 07:48.427
Also, she has
a serious heart condition.

07:48.511 --> 07:53.224
I'm six years old, and tap
dancing is my favoritest thing,

07:53.307 --> 07:56.602
even if it's not
good for my pacemaker.

07:56.686 --> 07:57.895
ALL: Aww!

07:59.855 --> 08:01.273

08:01.357 --> 08:04.360
(WHISTLES) That is
one quality pacemaker.

08:05.236 --> 08:07.071
The rest of you might
as well give up now,

08:07.238 --> 08:09.031
'cause I'm gonna
take home the...

08:09.115 --> 08:10.992
Hey, what's my
grand prize gonna be?

08:11.075 --> 08:12.910
Oh, there is
no prize, Dorothy,

08:12.994 --> 08:15.496
unless you count
the satisfaction of winning.

08:15.579 --> 08:18.749
Itwill be mine!

08:21.419 --> 08:22.420
In conclusion,

08:22.503 --> 08:26.132
bullying in the workplace is
unacceptable and will not be tolerated.

08:26.257 --> 08:29.427
Out of my way, fatty!
I'm practicing. Whoa!

08:29.760 --> 08:32.596
(HUMMING)
ALL: Ow!

08:32.888 --> 08:33.889
Ta-da!

08:35.057 --> 08:39.020
Friends, I'd like you to
meet my new lady. Marianne.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.645
Whoa!
Hey!

08:41.230 --> 08:43.107
What's the catch?
She looks normal.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.027
She's not a hologram.

08:46.110 --> 08:47.903
Not a robo-slave.

08:47.987 --> 08:48.988
We give uP-

08:49.113 --> 08:51.323
(GIGGLES)
You guys are weird.

08:51.407 --> 08:52.950
I have to go
open my flower stand

08:53.075 --> 08:54.618
before the falafel
guy takes my spot,

08:54.702 --> 08:56.120
but it was great to meet you.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.664
See you later, crab cakes.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.378
Dr. Zoidberg, she's great.

09:04.462 --> 09:06.964
She's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

09:07.048 --> 09:10.301
We had a wonderful night of
love-making in my dumpster.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.635
ALL: Ew!

09:12.094 --> 09:14.305
I hope she used protection.

09:14.388 --> 09:15.723
No offense, Zoidberg,

09:15.806 --> 09:19.393
but how is she not driven to madness
by your mind-altering stench?

09:19.477 --> 09:23.189
Because, my friends,
she has no sense of smell.

09:23.355 --> 09:25.232
That explains it.
I get it.

09:25.316 --> 09:29.487
For the first time in
my life, I'm truly happy.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.281
It's just too bad for her
there's no cure, I assume.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.866
Oh, but there is!

09:33.949 --> 09:37.078
A skilled surgeon could
perform a nose transplant.

09:37.161 --> 09:38.871
Ah! You're right!

09:38.954 --> 09:42.500
And I, as a renowned ear,
nose, and blowhole doctor,

09:42.583 --> 09:44.251
could do the operation!

09:44.335 --> 09:47.379
Are you nuts? If she could
smell, she'd smell you!

09:47.463 --> 09:49.048
Your relationship
would be over

09:49.173 --> 09:50.800
faster than you can say...
(WRETCHES)

09:50.883 --> 09:52.760
Listen to Orange Joe.

09:52.843 --> 09:56.639
You must never let the girl
know of this wonderful surgery.

09:56.847 --> 10:00.810
Oh, I don't know. It doesn't
seem fair to Marianne.

10:00.893 --> 10:03.979
But on the other claw, maybe
I can't live without her.

10:04.063 --> 10:07.650
So, you're right.
I can never tell her.

10:07.733 --> 10:09.693
You're doing
the right thing.

10:12.655 --> 10:14.782
Today, the competition begins.

10:14.865 --> 10:16.200
Over the course of the summer,

10:16.283 --> 10:18.619
we'll be eliminating
one contestant each week,

10:18.702 --> 10:20.121
and by "we" I mean "me".

10:20.204 --> 10:21.789
Deal with it, you babies!

in and take the room,

for next week's championship.

Bender and Tonya!

I just wanna have fun because
dancing is fun, and I like dancing.

everything about flowers.

but how they smell.

Please.
Describe it to me.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.717
(SNIFFS) Uh...

11:56.800 --> 11:59.887
It's like summer, with a
dab of vanilla and honey,

11:59.970 --> 12:02.264
or maybe winter
with some gravy on it.

12:02.348 --> 12:07.186
(SIGHS) I'd give anything to be
able to smell a flower like that.

12:10.773 --> 12:12.483
Marianne, my love,

12:12.566 --> 12:15.903
I've never known anyone
who wanted to smell so badly,

12:15.986 --> 12:17.988
and there's
a way maybe you can.

12:18.072 --> 12:20.074
Really? How?

12:20.157 --> 12:23.869
We have in the doctor world
something called a nose transplant.

12:23.953 --> 12:25.329
I can give you a surgery.

12:25.412 --> 12:30.334
And when it's done, you'll
be able to smell everything.

12:30.417 --> 12:34.838
Oh, Zoidberg! I want the
biggest nose you can find!

12:41.011 --> 12:42.888

accomplished so much more

12:45.683 --> 12:47.101
than most of us
would bother to.

I got a full-proof plan to
make sure I go home the champ!

12:51.814 --> 12:53.399
You're gonna put
sequins on your hat?

12:53.482 --> 12:55.901
(SCOFFS) See that locker?

12:55.985 --> 12:57.945
Tonya keeps her
tap shoes in there.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.782
So right before she dances, I'll sneak
in and put rusty tacks in them.

13:01.865 --> 13:03.534
(CACKLES)
(GASPS)

13:03.993 --> 13:06.787
The harder she dances,
the more she bleeds.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.414
Seems like a solid plan.

13:08.539 --> 13:11.417
What? It's the most horrifying
thing I've ever heard!

13:11.542 --> 13:12.501
That's true.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.711
Well, it gets worse.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.963
Once Tonya drops
out due to blood loss,

13:16.088 --> 13:18.299
I kidnap her parents
and make them watch

13:18.382 --> 13:20.718
while I cut off her hair
with these hedge clippers.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.554
Don't you lay
a hand on that angel!

13:23.637 --> 13:26.807
Angel? I've looked into her
eyes and seen her soul!

13:26.890 --> 13:28.309
She's a monster.

You're insane.

I think it's noble of you
to give Marianne a new nose.

14:10.601 --> 14:14.688
Yeah. She'll be forever
grateful from somewhere upwind.

14:14.772 --> 14:18.025
True. Our relationship will
end once she smells my odor.

14:18.108 --> 14:20.069
But you know what
would really stink?

14:20.152 --> 14:21.945
If Marianne
spent her whole life
