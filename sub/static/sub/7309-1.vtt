WEBVTT

01:21.020 --> 01:22.570
Federal Agent! Halt!

01:23.800 --> 01:25.220
Hands up in the air! Now!

01:32.520 --> 01:34.130
Eschel?

02:33.828 --> 02:34.828
Missed me.

02:35.417 --> 02:37.292
Is he here yet? Is he here yet?

02:37.797 --> 02:40.553
Abby, do you think I'd be
playing this game if he was?

02:43.976 --> 02:46.433
I will call you as soon as
he gets here, okay? I promise.

02:47.038 --> 02:48.021
What if his plan was delayed?

02:48.047 --> 02:50.073
Or worse. What if he missed
his connecting flight?

02:50.125 --> 02:51.883
Well, then, he will be here tomorrow.

02:51.907 --> 02:52.891
Not good enough, McGee.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.463
A team needs a leader.

02:54.487 --> 02:55.473
He's our glue.

02:55.497 --> 02:57.390
He's our-our spine.

02:57.488 --> 03:01.082
Without him, we're like phylum cnidaria.

03:02.135 --> 03:02.823
Jellyfish.

03:02.847 --> 03:03.891
Exactly.

03:05.796 --> 03:07.272
U saying I'm spineless?

03:08.475 --> 03:09.903
Of course not, Timmy.

03:11.567 --> 03:12.812
I'm going to check his flight.

03:13.487 --> 03:15.611
Abby, you're getting powder
all over my keyboard.

03:15.635 --> 03:16.750
What's your point?

03:17.328 --> 03:19.082
My point is, Abby, uh,

03:19.106 --> 03:22.851
you are really, really
overdoing the sugar thing again.

03:23.206 --> 03:24.600
Well, I'm eating for two.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.713
Relax.

03:28.036 --> 03:31.391
I was referring to the
health food freak over there.

03:32.058 --> 03:33.338
Every time I walk past her desk,

03:33.418 --> 03:36.831
I have this irresistible urge to
shove a cheeseburger down her throat.

03:37.288 --> 03:38.582
I think she's kind of hot.

03:38.717 --> 03:39.743
Oh, you think she's hot?

03:39.767 --> 03:42.041
Yeah, you know, for a probie.

03:42.408 --> 03:45.520
You two do realize I
can hear you, right?

03:46.717 --> 03:47.840
We do now,

03:47.936 --> 03:50.300
very Special Agent Lee.

03:51.518 --> 03:52.823
His flight landed on time.

03:52.847 --> 03:54.073
Where is he?

03:58.347 --> 04:00.142
Oh, yay! You're home!

04:00.166 --> 04:01.773
Welcome back.

04:01.797 --> 04:03.571
I missed you.

04:04.957 --> 04:06.142
I missed you too, Abby.

04:06.166 --> 04:07.094
Oh, did you have fun?

04:07.118 --> 04:09.742
Did you got to that
cool bar in Dusseldorf?

04:09.926 --> 04:11.254
You know, I tried, but,

04:11.278 --> 04:14.232
you know, the security
conference kept us pretty busy.

04:15.638 --> 04:18.541
- I'm having trouble breathing, Abby.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:19.998 --> 04:21.752
- See?
- McGee.

04:22.055 --> 04:23.892
Look at you.

04:24.987 --> 04:26.023
All grown up.

04:26.138 --> 04:28.080
So what'd I miss the last two weeks?

04:28.257 --> 04:29.803
Well, nothing I couldn't handle, boss.

04:29.827 --> 04:33.642
Good, and to think the Director
didn't have any faith in you.

04:34.236 --> 04:35.452
What do you mean the Director...

04:35.476 --> 04:38.472
Gather 'round, people.
I come earing gifts.

04:41.778 --> 04:43.402
For the lovely lady.

04:44.038 --> 04:46.144
Oh! Tony, it's beautiful.

04:46.168 --> 04:48.231
Not to mention, incredibly expensive.

04:48.535 --> 04:50.182
Euro's stronger than it used to be.

04:50.355 --> 04:52.540
For my senior field agent...

04:55.788 --> 04:58.412
The Very Best of David Hasselhoff.

04:59.947 --> 05:01.324
You don't like it?

05:01.348 --> 05:05.293
I repeat, The Very Best
of David Hasselhoff.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.222
What was that for?

05:10.246 --> 05:12.002
You listen to Yanni.

05:12.106 --> 05:14.883
And you have an unauthorized
game on your computer.

05:15.555 --> 05:17.121
Okay, it's your game, Tony.

05:17.145 --> 05:18.933
Yeah, you shouldn't have
beaten my high score.

05:18.957 --> 05:21.521
And for Ziva...

05:22.255 --> 05:24.223
Das lederhosen.

05:24.615 --> 05:26.023
One size fits all.

05:26.076 --> 05:26.992
Where is the, uh,

05:27.016 --> 05:28.694
little Israeli? Late, sir.

05:28.718 --> 05:30.320
Second time this week.

05:30.486 --> 05:32.103
Agent Lee.

05:32.476 --> 05:36.272
My favorite
probie-slash-hall monitor.

05:36.606 --> 05:40.662
I bet you're wondering what the
newest member of Team DiNozzo gets.

05:41.048 --> 05:43.602
Well, we saved the best for last here.

05:45.255 --> 05:47.983
This was not easy getting
through customs, but...

05:51.488 --> 05:52.660
A stapler?

05:54.916 --> 05:56.242
It's a German stapler.

05:56.266 --> 05:59.212
But it says "Made in China," sir.

06:00.525 --> 06:01.983
Oh, yeah.

06:02.167 --> 06:04.113
Well, German, Eurasian, China.

06:04.137 --> 06:06.421
It's a global village, Lee.
Get used to it.

06:06.627 --> 06:07.881
She's over an hour late, sir.

06:07.905 --> 06:10.273
That's unusual even for her.

06:10.368 --> 06:12.642
What did I tell you
about worrying, probie?

06:12.676 --> 06:14.454
That it's, uh, your job.

06:14.478 --> 06:15.622
See, you're learning.

06:15.646 --> 06:18.200
But she's not answering
her... I'm sorry, sir.

06:18.258 --> 06:20.821
She's not answering
her cell phone either.

06:21.335 --> 06:24.662
Okay, there is only one thing you
need to know about Officer David.

06:24.726 --> 06:26.000
Don't make her angry.

06:26.068 --> 06:27.788
So, technically, really, there's
two things.

06:28.058 --> 06:29.460
The other is...

06:30.107 --> 06:32.003
she can take care of herself.

06:32.226 --> 06:34.122
I cannot wait any longer!

06:34.157 --> 06:35.192
Produce Officer Bashan or

06:35.216 --> 06:37.992
I start with your hands
and I will not stop until-

06:38.066 --> 06:39.781
Officer David, what did I tell you.

06:39.805 --> 06:41.701
About terrorizing my men?

06:43.597 --> 06:45.541
Leave us alone please.

06:50.627 --> 06:52.751
Come, Ziva, sit.

06:56.768 --> 07:00.811
Okay, what seems to be the problem?

07:00.976 --> 07:02.962
Why was I not told about this operation?

07:03.018 --> 07:04.371
I suppose the simple answer would be,

07:04.395 --> 07:06.021
your father did not want you to know.

07:06.045 --> 07:08.742
And he wonders why I barely
talk to him anymore, Michael?

07:08.987 --> 07:12.073
A fact I know he regrets very much, Ziva.

07:12.125 --> 07:13.233
Very much.

07:13.825 --> 07:17.820
I've spent a year building
relationships and trust with NCIS.

07:17.915 --> 07:20.182
How do you suggest I
explain this to them?

07:20.325 --> 07:22.783
I realize this places you in
an awkward position, but, Ziva...

07:22.807 --> 07:24.611
They were sloppy, blatant.

07:24.657 --> 07:26.141
And you should have known better.

07:26.207 --> 07:29.473
The Americans can be quite
prudish in their attitudes, Ziva.

07:29.577 --> 07:31.431
You call what happened prudish?

07:31.658 --> 07:32.893
That depends.

07:32.958 --> 07:35.192
Did you or did you not sleep with him?

07:37.056 --> 07:37.721
Who?

07:37.745 --> 07:40.511
Anthony DiNozzo, your new team leader.

07:41.298 --> 07:43.018
Why do you ask that?

07:43.042 --> 07:44.369
Starting three months ago,

07:44.437 --> 07:48.493
Ziva, he's been visiting your
apartment at least one night a week.

07:54.746 --> 07:56.923
My father has you spying on me?

07:58.877 --> 08:01.224
I assumed that was the
reason for your visit.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.981
Well, you assumed wrong, Officer Bashan.

08:04.307 --> 08:05.561
I am here because an hour ago,

08:05.856 --> 08:09.491
a Mossad assassination team
killed three people in Georgetown.

08:10.798 --> 08:13.043
We have no active operations
scheduled in Georgetown...

08:13.067 --> 08:14.744
Michael, don't lie to me.

08:14.768 --> 08:15.383
I was there.

08:15.407 --> 08:16.723
I tried to stop it.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.413
What exactly did you see?

08:23.395 --> 08:25.043
Officer Namir Eschel.

08:26.685 --> 08:29.373
- No. Impossible.
- I spoke to him.

08:29.526 --> 08:31.211
I let him go.

08:38.868 --> 08:40.323
Secure line to Tel Aviv.

08:42.335 --> 08:44.020
I need to speak to director.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.222
Immediately.

08:46.306 --> 08:47.660
Tell him...

08:49.735 --> 08:51.623
Tell him it concerns family.

08:54.695 --> 08:57.843
Do you realize how close I
came to shooting Eschel today?

08:58.615 --> 09:00.401
Namir Eschel is dead, Ziva.

09:02.346 --> 09:06.132
Your father and I attended
his funeral six months ago.

09:09.186 --> 09:11.922
Ziva, just, uh, call us as
soon as you get the message.

09:11.946 --> 09:15.773
We're not worried. Just
give us a call, please.

09:16.838 --> 09:18.653
Okay, now I'm starting to worry.

09:19.005 --> 09:20.410
Think she's all right?

09:20.506 --> 09:23.583
Well, if she was all
right, she'd be here, McGee.

09:24.515 --> 09:27.650
The question is: What would Gibbs
do in a situation like this?

09:27.707 --> 09:28.733
He'd find her, Tony.

09:28.788 --> 09:30.493
I'm working on it, Director.

09:30.545 --> 09:32.050
Work harder.

09:32.765 --> 09:36.302
Metro Police just found her
car on a sidewalk in Georgetown.

09:36.357 --> 09:38.871
Actually, that's not that
unusual when Ziva's driving.

09:38.926 --> 09:42.852
Yeah, I drove all the way through Eastern
Europe with her - I should know, McGee.

09:43.358 --> 09:45.163
But in my experience...

09:46.508 --> 09:50.270
the FBI doesn't usually concern
themselves with traffic accidents.

09:50.358 --> 09:52.850
Tony, isn't that the guy that
tried to put you away for murder?

09:52.888 --> 09:55.371
Yes, it is, and thank you for
bringing up a painful memory, McGee.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.013
You knew they were coming, Director?

09:57.037 --> 09:57.974
Calm down, Tony.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.004
I only just got the
call two minutes ago.

10:00.028 --> 10:01.242
What do they want with Ziva?

10:01.315 --> 10:02.833
We're about to find out.

10:03.085 --> 10:04.533
Together.

10:05.235 --> 10:07.131
Agent Sacks, Director Shepard.

10:07.155 --> 10:08.352
Director Shepard.

10:12.098 --> 10:13.733
We have confirmed your report.

10:13.827 --> 10:16.352
The man you saw killed was Abdul Wazir,

10:16.408 --> 10:18.712
a former Syrian Army Colonel.

10:19.558 --> 10:22.401
Wanted for crimes against
the state of Israel.

10:22.456 --> 10:24.936
Seems I'm not the only one my
father likes to keep in the dark.

10:24.965 --> 10:27.060
This was not a sanctioned action, Ziva.

10:27.116 --> 10:28.701
We had no hand in this.

10:28.765 --> 10:29.651
You mean officially.

10:29.706 --> 10:30.822
Officially

10:30.846 --> 10:32.280
or unofficially.

10:32.328 --> 10:34.322
We knew he was in American custody.

10:34.366 --> 10:38.653
Offered protection in return for supplying
information on al Qaeda cells in Iraq.

10:38.707 --> 10:40.531
Protection from what?

10:42.895 --> 10:43.522
Us.

10:43.546 --> 10:45.432
The two men guarding him?

10:45.487 --> 10:47.063
FBI agents.

10:47.127 --> 10:48.272
Dear God, Michael.

10:48.536 --> 10:51.363
Obviously, Eschel faked his own death.

10:51.416 --> 10:54.763
He's operating without
orders, making his own decisions.

10:54.818 --> 10:57.943
Or perhaps that is merely a
cover my father designed for him.

10:58.017 --> 10:59.071
Do you really believe
he would jeopardize

10:59.095 --> 11:01.943
our relations with the
Americans like this?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.940
There are days I don't know
what to believe anymore, Michael.

11:06.805 --> 11:10.462
You have not been
dismissed yet, Officer David.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.533
I have to contact NCIS.

11:12.577 --> 11:14.310
Your orders are to remain here

11:14.336 --> 11:17.533
until we figure out a
strategy to deal with this.

11:17.568 --> 11:18.992
Eschel murdered two Americans

11:19.016 --> 11:20.371
and a man in their custody.

11:20.427 --> 11:23.030
Our strategy is simple.
Find him and kill him.

11:23.426 --> 11:24.663
There are complications.

11:24.687 --> 11:26.490
Which NCIS can help us with.

11:26.537 --> 11:29.522
You left your car at the
crime scene this morning.

11:29.595 --> 11:31.781
It was disabled. I was
trying to prevent the attack.

11:31.805 --> 11:34.071
The Americans do not see it this way.

11:34.266 --> 11:35.266
Director Shepard will.

11:39.325 --> 11:40.722
Ziva.

11:43.185 --> 11:47.183
The FBI has already issued
a warrant for your arrest.

11:47.487 --> 11:48.672
On what charges?

11:48.696 --> 11:50.283
Espionage

11:51.237 --> 11:52.543
and murder.

12:04.811 --> 12:06.826
This is a political nightmare.

12:06.900 --> 12:09.114
I'm asking for your patience, Ziva.

12:09.268 --> 12:11.124
We need time to deal with this.

12:11.148 --> 12:12.934
You would hold me
against my will, Michael?

12:12.958 --> 12:15.136
I will do what's best for you.

12:18.289 --> 12:19.665
Your father...

12:19.999 --> 12:22.544
he will find a solution to this, Ziva.

12:24.391 --> 12:26.544
Like he did for my brother Ari?

12:28.020 --> 12:30.074
Escort her to guest quarters.

12:30.140 --> 12:32.964
And do not forget to
confiscate her weapons.

12:33.468 --> 12:35.154
I'm sorry for this.

12:35.448 --> 12:36.866
As am I.

12:40.680 --> 12:42.335
I was talking to you.

12:45.861 --> 12:48.143
Ever been tied up by a woman before?

12:50.430 --> 12:51.856
Did you like it?

12:53.331 --> 12:55.426
Then, today is not your lucky day.

13:01.249 --> 13:02.296
Very professional.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.306
Your Director kicked
us both out, DiNozzo.

13:04.341 --> 13:06.347
Only because you couldn't
keep your soup cooler shut.

13:06.371 --> 13:09.476
Well, your Mossad liaison officer
killed two FBI agents today.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.415
Sorry if that pisses me off.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.123
- Where's your proof?
- Proof?

13:13.260 --> 13:14.324
Car abandoned

13:14.370 --> 13:15.704
at the crime scene,

13:15.759 --> 13:18.293
the Syrian was on
their most wanted list,

13:18.350 --> 13:21.255
she's disappeared, and, oh, yeah, her
brother

13:21.308 --> 13:23.064
was a Hamas terrorist.

13:23.118 --> 13:25.246
Where I come from, that's
called circumstantial.

13:25.279 --> 13:27.606
Really? Where's that - Narnia?

13:28.991 --> 13:31.104
It's a fantasy movie. The
Chronicles of Narnia...

13:31.128 --> 13:32.215
I know what it is!

13:33.341 --> 13:35.014
Okay story, excellent special effects.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.514
They were definitely kicking.

13:36.558 --> 13:37.645
That's not my point.

13:37.700 --> 13:38.394
Six months ago,

13:38.418 --> 13:42.113
you were convinced that I killed
a woman and chopped of her legs.

13:42.149 --> 13:43.733
I'm still not convinced you didn't.

13:43.790 --> 13:44.956
Exactly.

13:44.980 --> 13:49.186
So Ziva David is being framed. By who?

13:49.618 --> 13:51.935
Well, that's what I intend to find out.

13:52.969 --> 13:54.576
Good luck with that.

13:56.319 --> 13:57.544
You two.

13:57.568 --> 13:59.096
Up here, now.

13:59.149 --> 14:01.345
Director, will you please
tell Agent Slacks...

14:01.369 --> 14:03.166
Sacks. It's Sacks.

14:03.240 --> 14:05.016
Will you please tell Agent Slacks

14:05.040 --> 14:07.586
that we're going to be
handling this one in-house?

14:07.891 --> 14:09.895
I just assured your
director that the FBI

14:09.919 --> 14:14.375
will be getting NCIS' complete
cooperation in this matter.

14:15.090 --> 14:16.166
Thank you, ma'am.

14:16.190 --> 14:19.644
If Ziva attempts to contact
you or anyone on your team,

14:19.678 --> 14:21.247
I want you to notify both myself

14:21.271 --> 14:25.086
and Agent Sacks immediately.

14:25.171 --> 14:25.987
This is complete bull...

14:26.011 --> 14:29.826
This... is an order from
your director, Agent DiNozzo.

14:29.911 --> 14:31.694
Is that clear enough for you?

14:31.771 --> 14:33.615
Almost crystal, ma'am.

14:39.101 --> 14:42.255
I give you my word that I will try

14:42.279 --> 14:45.073
and keep an open mind on this.

14:45.228 --> 14:46.704
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:47.299 --> 14:48.286
Okay.

14:48.310 --> 14:51.916
- Liste, um, about what happened between us before...
- No hard feelings.

14:52.001 --> 14:52.855
I got it.

14:52.879 --> 14:55.865
No, I was going to say I still
pretty much hate your guts, Sacks.

14:55.891 --> 14:57.495
Me, too, DiNozzo.

14:57.571 --> 14:58.763
Me, too.

14:58.951 --> 15:00.025
Tony?

15:01.779 --> 15:03.885
That question you asked me earlier:

15:04.081 --> 15:05.845
What would Gibbs do?

15:06.089 --> 15:08.843
Gibbs isn't here, you are.

15:16.489 --> 15:17.489
Gibbs...

15:19.119 --> 15:21.303
This is really, really bad.

15:21.769 --> 15:23.704
Ziva has disappeared

15:23.739 --> 15:26.424
and everyone's saying that
she's just like her brother.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.116
I really, really

15:28.190 --> 15:29.895
need you to call me.

15:30.608 --> 15:31.608
Please.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.284
Gibbs?

15:36.700 --> 15:37.904
Abby, it's Ziva.

15:38.899 --> 15:40.154
Ziva.

15:40.530 --> 15:41.855
Are you all right?

15:41.901 --> 15:43.775
No, and don't say my name so loud.

15:43.850 --> 15:44.850
Sorry.

15:44.948 --> 15:46.403
Where are you?

15:46.751 --> 15:48.853
At a safe place at the moment.

15:48.891 --> 15:49.956
The FBI was here

15:49.981 --> 15:52.136
and Tony was freaking out

15:52.190 --> 15:52.816
and the Director...

15:52.840 --> 15:54.894
Abby, I need you to do a favor for me.

15:54.950 --> 15:55.944
You name it.

15:55.968 --> 15:58.764
First, you can't tell
anyone I've spoken to you.

15:58.819 --> 16:00.076
Except Tony, right?

16:00.100 --> 16:02.435
No. Not even Tony.

16:02.720 --> 16:05.445
If I talk to him, he'll get
in trouble with the FBI.

16:05.500 --> 16:07.233
What do you need?

16:09.729 --> 16:11.133
A phone number.

16:13.978 --> 16:16.733
All right. I'll call
you back at this number.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.193
Abby,

16:20.630 --> 16:21.654
who was that?

16:22.888 --> 16:24.004
Where?

16:24.748 --> 16:26.053
On the phone.

16:28.310 --> 16:30.583
That... it was the nuns.

16:30.680 --> 16:31.794
The nuns?

16:31.818 --> 16:33.975
Yep, you know nuns with the...

16:33.999 --> 16:35.246
big white hats and the...

16:35.321 --> 16:36.354
The hats.

16:36.378 --> 16:37.666
Yeah, they're called habits.

16:37.690 --> 16:38.714
Big white hats.

16:38.738 --> 16:43.063
Yep. They-they called to say that
bowling practice is cancelled.

16:43.218 --> 16:44.414
Bowling nuns?

16:44.470 --> 16:47.176
Jeez, McGee, what, are you on some
sort of anti-nun crusade here?

16:47.468 --> 16:48.566
What? Wait, no...

16:48.590 --> 16:50.664
Okay, all right, lay off the nuns.

16:51.491 --> 16:52.485
I need to contact Gibbs.

16:52.509 --> 16:54.753
If we're going to get Ziva out of this,

16:54.800 --> 16:56.036
I'm going to need his advice.

16:56.089 --> 16:58.344
Well, last I heard, he
was still in Mexico.

16:58.419 --> 17:00.826
Well, there must be
some way to contact him.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.843
Aw, damn it!

17:12.781 --> 17:13.781
Hey,

17:14.209 --> 17:15.209
you say something?

17:15.810 --> 17:16.896
Four months

17:16.938 --> 17:21.375
and you still don't understand the
meaning of the word siesta, probie?

17:21.438 --> 17:23.714
Roof's not going to fix itself, Mike.

17:23.790 --> 17:26.685
Tropical storm season's
only a few weeks away.

17:26.771 --> 17:29.674
You ever stop to think
that I might like rain?

17:29.739 --> 17:30.824
Yeah,

17:30.960 --> 17:33.705
just maybe not inside your house.

17:35.299 --> 17:38.493
Don't you have a boat
to build or something?

17:38.799 --> 17:40.346
Yeah, well, the problem with that, Mike,

17:40.370 --> 17:45.063
is I'm using all my good lumber
to fix your dog rot house.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.434
I got a better idea.

17:48.139 --> 17:50.466
Why don't you use it
to build your own...

17:50.521 --> 17:52.685
somewhere down there.

17:54.959 --> 17:58.804
- Hey, you just say the word.
- I'll be gone.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.353
Don't tempt me, Jethro.

18:01.438 --> 18:03.616
I ain't nearly drunk enough.

18:03.718 --> 18:04.666
But until then,

18:04.690 --> 18:07.647
I was thinking your next
project would be a nice,

18:07.671 --> 18:11.446
little hot tub. Say yea big,

18:11.491 --> 18:12.854
right over there.

18:14.710 --> 18:17.224
You want teak or redwood?

18:17.528 --> 18:19.255
Hola, gentlemen.

18:19.331 --> 18:22.624
Gentlemen? She can't be
talking to ou and me, Gunny.

18:22.659 --> 18:24.063
You? No.

18:24.141 --> 18:26.395
Señor Gibbs, si

18:26.780 --> 18:29.633
- I hope you're not letting him work you so hard.
- Nah.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.204
He's living here for free.

18:31.228 --> 18:32.764
What does he expect?

18:32.838 --> 18:34.906
Perhaps someday he will tell us.

18:35.291 --> 18:36.291
Hey,

18:36.910 --> 18:38.895
how much do I owe you?

18:39.691 --> 18:41.735
25 American.

18:41.841 --> 18:43.557
- And you have a phone call.
- Okay.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.345
Uh, not you.

18:45.830 --> 18:48.605
Leroy Jethro.

18:49.311 --> 18:50.615
Who is it?

18:50.671 --> 18:51.953
A woman.

18:52.019 --> 18:54.186
And she sounded muy upset.

18:55.039 --> 18:56.996
It's probably that
lady director of yours,

18:57.020 --> 18:59.593
about to have a nervous breakdown.

19:01.590 --> 19:02.765
Yeah. Gibbs.

19:03.159 --> 19:04.159
Hola.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.485
Uh, how's Mexico?

19:06.558 --> 19:07.863
Ziva.

19:08.111 --> 19:09.533
How'd you get this number?

19:09.621 --> 19:13.073
From Abby, and if it helps, I
forced it out of her.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.286
No, it doesn't.What's wrong?

19:15.701 --> 19:17.525
Why does something
always have to be wrong?

19:17.589 --> 19:20.115
Can't I just speak with an old friennd?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.243
Do a little catching up?

19:22.328 --> 19:23.735
Today, Ziva.

19:24.269 --> 19:25.335
Ok.

19:29.081 --> 19:31.175
I may be in a little bit of trouble.

19:31.320 --> 19:32.554
Yeah?

19:33.579 --> 19:34.875
Define "little."

19:34.899 --> 19:36.795
I am currently on the run

19:37.001 --> 19:40.393
from the FBI, NCIS, Mossad, and my father.

19:40.468 --> 19:41.734
Jeez, what'd you do?

19:41.779 --> 19:43.095
I did nothing, Gibbs.

19:43.769 --> 19:45.357
I swear I did nothing.

19:45.381 --> 19:46.863
Where's DiNozzo?

19:46.900 --> 19:48.254
He can't help me.

19:48.328 --> 19:49.735
Well, you should talk to Jenny.

19:49.759 --> 19:50.935
Jenny can help you.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.123
I can't...

19:52.198 --> 19:53.996
Ziva, look, I'm retired.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.546
I'm 3,000 miles away.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.294
What do you think I can
do that they can't do?

19:59.359 --> 20:01.235
Honestly, I don't know.

20:02.799 --> 20:05.265
I was hoping maybe...

20:07.198 --> 20:08.664
save me.

20:16.379 --> 20:17.527
Two days...

20:17.551 --> 20:18.854
How long are these
guys going to be here?

20:18.878 --> 20:20.657
Officer David was here for a year.

20:20.681 --> 20:22.954
Who knows how badly she
compromised our security?

20:22.978 --> 20:24.524
What did you say, probie?

20:24.580 --> 20:26.045
Oh, come on, McGee.

20:26.118 --> 20:27.855
You think we don't
spy on our allies, too?

20:27.879 --> 20:29.215
It happens all the time.

20:29.239 --> 20:30.513
Agent Lee.

20:30.799 --> 20:31.294
Sir?

20:31.318 --> 20:32.326
Shut up and keep an eye on the Feds.

20:32.350 --> 20:34.984
McGee, you're with me.
We got places to be.

20:35.431 --> 20:38.086
Should be done
here, DiNozzo, in another...

20:38.139 --> 20:40.074
oh, five, six more hours.

20:42.740 --> 20:46.833
First off, this is a
strictly voluntary thing.

20:46.951 --> 20:48.714
Ziva's a fugitive.

20:49.031 --> 20:50.814
Anyone caught helping

20:50.838 --> 20:54.456
or assisting her in any way
will be in serious trouble.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.965
Palmer? Um, by serious,

20:57.018 --> 20:59.395
uh, you mean, we could, like, get fired?

20:59.451 --> 21:00.636
He means, Mr. Palmer,

21:00.660 --> 21:03.374
instead of attending
medical school next month,

21:03.431 --> 21:06.146
you'll most likely be in prison.

21:06.218 --> 21:07.454
Oh.

21:09.009 --> 21:10.005
I'm in.

21:10.029 --> 21:12.105
Danger, intrigue, a damsel in distress.

21:12.129 --> 21:14.706
I'm actually looking forward to it.

21:14.739 --> 21:15.964
Me, too.

21:17.911 --> 21:19.014
I'm not exactly the type

21:19.038 --> 21:21.704
that would do well in prison, guys.

21:21.738 --> 21:24.105
No one's going to think any less
of you if you want out, Palmer.

21:24.129 --> 21:24.895
Really?

21:24.971 --> 21:26.744
Well, no, they probably would.

21:26.768 --> 21:28.974
At least I know I would.

21:29.458 --> 21:30.355
All right, then I want a code name,

21:30.379 --> 21:32.063
something cool-sounding.

21:32.129 --> 21:33.129
All right.

21:33.588 --> 21:36.845
No one can know about
this, especially the Director.

21:37.198 --> 21:38.924
We all good with that?

21:40.478 --> 21:43.664
All right, then, let's
figure out how to find her.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.187
McGee, I want you on
her electronic tracks.

21:46.211 --> 21:48.974
Cell phone, computer, toaster
oven if you have to.

21:48.998 --> 21:51.896
Ducky, please talk to
your contacts in the FBI.

21:51.948 --> 21:54.394
I want to know everything about
that Georgetown crime scene.

21:54.418 --> 21:56.765
Palmer, how does "Black Lung" sound?

21:57.068 --> 21:59.134
Like a horrible and painful way to die.

21:59.208 --> 22:00.224
I mean, as your code name.

22:00.248 --> 22:01.463
Oh, I like it. Yeah.

22:01.578 --> 22:05.274
All right, then you're in
charge of supplies, Black Lung.

22:05.308 --> 22:08.946
Which means lunch and at
this point, probably dinner.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.856
- Abs, I need you to go...
- I talked to Ziva yesterday.

22:13.059 --> 22:15.236
You don't bowl with nuns.

22:15.310 --> 22:16.306
I should have seen that coming.

22:16.330 --> 22:18.013
I do.

22:18.719 --> 22:20.905
Ziva made me promise not to tell.

22:20.941 --> 22:24.543
Why would Ziva care we knew
that you bowl with nuns?

22:24.608 --> 22:26.976
I think she means that Ziva didn't
want us getting in trouble, Ducky.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.985
It's a bit late for that.

22:29.051 --> 22:30.533
Where is she?

22:32.539 --> 22:34.425
All I have is this phone number.

22:41.210 --> 22:42.994
Well, there's no answer.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.274
Abby, are you sure that this...?

22:45.329 --> 22:46.329
Ziva.

22:46.468 --> 22:48.173
Tell Abby I'm going to kill her.

22:48.578 --> 22:50.125
We love you, too.

22:50.158 --> 22:51.195
I'm hanging up now.

22:51.249 --> 22:51.836
No, you're not.

22:51.860 --> 22:53.514
You're going to tell me what
the hell is going on here.

22:53.538 --> 22:55.433
Your phone could be tapped, Tony.

22:55.490 --> 22:56.197
Well, then, I'll come to you.

22:56.221 --> 22:57.996
I'm also trying to get a
hold of Gibbs right now,

22:58.020 --> 22:59.563
but I'm not having any luck.

22:59.608 --> 23:01.003
Gibbs?

23:01.068 --> 23:02.644
Why didn't you say so.

23:03.728 --> 23:04.795
DiNozzo,

23:05.418 --> 23:10.085
you have ten seconds to tell me why I
am not building teak hot tub in Mexico.

23:12.028 --> 23:13.133
Nine...

23:21.927 --> 23:23.801
The target's name was Abdul Wazir.

23:23.867 --> 23:26.364
A Syrian wanted for crimes
against the state of Israel.

23:26.409 --> 23:29.253
- Terminated by this man.
- Mossad Officer Namir Eschel,

23:29.318 --> 23:30.884
my former team-mate

23:30.908 --> 23:33.424
when I was stationed in Paris.

23:33.527 --> 23:35.083
Who's supposed to be dead.

23:36.157 --> 23:37.397
Apparently, he's gotten better.

23:37.449 --> 23:39.455
Being dead makes for a good cover.

23:41.007 --> 23:41.804
I would agree,

23:41.828 --> 23:45.593
but my father claims to have
no knowledge of his activities.

23:45.630 --> 23:46.713
I'd believe him.

23:48.298 --> 23:49.116
How many times do I have to tell you,

23:49.140 --> 23:52.542
- I don't believe in...
- In coincidences? I know.

23:52.569 --> 23:54.173
Lucky for you, neither do I.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.353
And according to the
FBI, I should be the one

23:56.438 --> 23:57.566
aiming my weapon at you.

23:57.590 --> 23:59.582
You were set up.

24:00.679 --> 24:02.934
The only Mossad liaison officer in D.C.

24:02.958 --> 24:06.383
just happens to be present
at a Metsada-style hit?

24:13.448 --> 24:15.085
Oh, God, I'm an idiot.

24:15.139 --> 24:16.863
He led me to the scene.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.423
Eschel framed me.

24:18.508 --> 24:19.895
Caca boudin ce méchant
mec avec des tresses!

24:19.919 --> 24:21.695
Yeah, but the question is why?

24:22.299 --> 24:23.925
Thought you might be needing this.

24:25.337 --> 24:26.325
Uh...

24:26.349 --> 24:27.734
I meant the NCIS cell phone.

24:27.758 --> 24:28.395
That's my...

24:28.419 --> 24:30.053
coffee, boss.

24:31.189 --> 24:33.793
Do I still look like your boss?

24:35.157 --> 24:37.953
Well, maybe, if you shaved and a...

24:38.087 --> 24:40.385
haircut... wouldn't hurt.

24:40.718 --> 24:42.626
Smile thing's definitely
throwing me off, too.

24:42.650 --> 24:45.293
It's good to see you again, McGee.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.618
DiNozzo.

24:47.507 --> 24:48.475
What'd I say?

24:48.499 --> 24:49.713
You called him McGee.

24:52.069 --> 24:54.074
That's probably because
if I left him in charge,

24:54.098 --> 24:57.344
you wouldn't be on the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list right now.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.513
B - but you do remember...

25:02.149 --> 25:03.206
That I left you in charge?

25:03.230 --> 25:05.255
Yeah, I remember I left
you in charge, DiNozzo.

25:05.279 --> 25:07.124
What I forgot is your taste in coffee.

25:07.148 --> 25:08.903
It stinks.

25:09.310 --> 25:11.394
I like sugar. It's my weakness.

25:11.420 --> 25:12.262
What's our plan?

25:12.319 --> 25:14.615
Things are bad enough for NCIS
as it is, Tony. You can't...

25:14.639 --> 25:17.443
I don't remember asking
your opinion, Officer David.

25:17.529 --> 25:18.455
You see?

25:18.500 --> 25:20.404
He's been completely
insufferable since you left.

25:20.428 --> 25:22.074
That true, Tony?

25:22.707 --> 25:23.707
When I need to be.

25:23.839 --> 25:24.839
Yeah?

25:25.830 --> 25:28.102
Maybe you were the
right man for the job.

25:31.150 --> 25:32.384
Our plan

25:32.638 --> 25:35.564
is to find this guy before
he gets out of the country.

25:36.139 --> 25:38.153
How do we put out a BOLO without the FBI

25:38.177 --> 25:40.343
finding out about it?

25:40.457 --> 25:42.415
I knew you'd ask me that, McGee.

25:42.449 --> 25:44.135
See? I knew you'd ask me that, McGee.

25:44.408 --> 25:45.444
And?

25:45.770 --> 25:47.296
And I... I don't know.

25:47.320 --> 25:48.294
Any suggestions?

25:48.318 --> 25:50.373
We could tell the FBI about Eschel

25:50.397 --> 25:51.495
and let them track him down.

25:51.519 --> 25:53.095
When they ask how we know about him...

25:53.119 --> 25:55.113
They'll know we talked to Ziva.

25:55.998 --> 25:57.453
McGee.

25:57.530 --> 25:59.182
Tony, what if we lie?

25:59.270 --> 26:00.383
Sacks is a self-centered,

26:00.407 --> 26:03.523
egotistical jack hole...

26:03.709 --> 26:05.935
but he's not an idiot. He'll know.

26:06.029 --> 26:07.523
No, I mean

26:07.617 --> 26:08.873
lie on the BOLO.

26:08.897 --> 26:12.953
Instead of looking for a rogue
Mossad spy wanted for murder,

26:13.070 --> 26:15.723
we put out a BOLO for a wife-beater.

26:16.507 --> 26:18.563
That's underhanded, devious...

26:18.587 --> 26:21.065
And it's completely getting me hot.

26:21.488 --> 26:24.132
Well, glad to see I'm
finally rubbing off on him.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.523
Do it.

26:32.938 --> 26:34.843
It's one of our old safe houses.

26:35.358 --> 26:40.395
We park on a dirt accesst road 200
meters behind it and enter from the back.

26:40.950 --> 26:42.493
You know he's not going to be here.

26:42.608 --> 26:45.003
It's the first place Mossad's
going to try to reacquire him.

26:45.079 --> 26:47.412
Mossad does not know
about this particular one.

26:48.268 --> 26:50.062
I set this one up for Ari.

26:50.330 --> 26:51.852
How's Eschel know about it?

26:51.910 --> 26:53.784
When Ari infiltrated
NCIS three years ago,

26:53.808 --> 26:57.132
Eschel was part of his recovery team.

26:58.537 --> 27:01.233
An FBI agent was killed then, too.

27:02.248 --> 27:04.494
Let's get this over with.

27:04.570 --> 27:06.622
I got a beach in Mexico waiting for me.

27:16.790 --> 27:18.884
Move and we shoot!

27:23.007 --> 27:24.372
Clear!

27:30.258 --> 27:32.504
He's dead. Rigor mortis
has already set in.

27:32.560 --> 27:34.352
How do you know he's not faking it?

27:34.418 --> 27:36.244
Well, shoot him if you don't believe me.

27:38.460 --> 27:40.024
U'd better hope that's not Eschel.

27:40.640 --> 27:42.484
Why? You want to kill him yourself now?

27:43.757 --> 27:45.824
But I won't and neither will you.

27:45.878 --> 27:46.674
We capture him alive.

27:46.698 --> 27:50.054
We kill him, there's no way to prove
you weren't involved in the hit.

27:51.438 --> 27:53.113
He look familiar?

27:54.058 --> 27:55.525
He's not Mossad.

27:56.609 --> 27:59.065
Eschel is obviously trying
to tie up his loose ends.

27:59.149 --> 28:01.205
Yeah, well, that's what you were.

28:01.229 --> 28:03.752
Spread out, start looking around.

28:03.878 --> 28:04.834
What for exactly?

28:04.858 --> 28:07.772
Anything that'll help us
find out where he went.

28:07.800 --> 28:08.800
Right.

28:13.738 --> 28:14.953
She looks a bit like her brother,

28:14.977 --> 28:16.375
don't you think?

28:16.698 --> 28:18.412
More like her father.

28:19.210 --> 28:20.573
Who's the man?

28:20.638 --> 28:22.444
Someone who shouldn't be with her.

28:22.520 --> 28:25.894
Retired Special Agent
Leroy Jethro Gibbs.

28:35.869 --> 28:36.869
Sacks.

28:38.819 --> 28:40.182
Who is this?

28:41.308 --> 28:43.335
How do I know this legit?

28:49.108 --> 28:50.215
We got a tip, guys.

28:50.247 --> 28:51.814
House in Fairfax.

29:13.939 --> 29:15.114
There's nothing here.

29:15.287 --> 29:18.043
Eschel was always good
at covering up his tracks.

29:24.677 --> 29:26.484
What is it?

29:31.018 --> 29:33.045
Oh le vil gredin des
enfers! He's made us.

29:33.768 --> 29:34.782
Impossible.

29:34.840 --> 29:36.972
I placed that camera myself.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.294
We need to detonate now.

29:56.318 --> 29:58.634
No, we wait for the FBI, Faatin.

29:58.688 --> 30:01.514
It must look like Ziva killed
herself instead of surrendering.

30:01.538 --> 30:04.125
If she leaves before
they get there, Namir?

30:05.047 --> 30:06.533
I will delay her.

30:12.047 --> 30:13.293
He was watching us.

30:13.317 --> 30:15.942
It could have been left
from when Ari was...

30:16.370 --> 30:18.354
He was watching us.

30:21.157 --> 30:22.235
What?

30:22.289 --> 30:23.915
I heard you retired.

30:23.939 --> 30:25.143
Yeah?

30:25.479 --> 30:27.104
I heard you were dead.

30:27.449 --> 30:29.322
To the Mossad, I am.

30:29.408 --> 30:30.185
We know you're alive now.

30:30.209 --> 30:32.063
I plan on fixing that.

30:32.398 --> 30:34.293
Poor Director David.

30:34.378 --> 30:37.622
First, his son's a traitor
and now his daughter.

30:37.697 --> 30:38.405
By this time tomorrow,

30:38.429 --> 30:40.355
he'll be working on a kibbutz.

30:40.587 --> 30:42.935
Unless, of course, he kills himself first.

30:43.417 --> 30:44.805
Is it true?

30:45.149 --> 30:46.665
Did you kill Ari Haswari?

30:47.798 --> 30:48.798
He's delaying us.

30:49.219 --> 30:51.303
Why? I'm his loose end, remember?

30:51.370 --> 30:52.305
He called the FBI.

30:52.329 --> 30:53.844
That's not what I'm worried about.

30:53.897 --> 30:57.022
When our safe house was compromised
in Paris, Eschel blew it up.

31:13.410 --> 31:15.302
Shalom Ziva.

31:36.394 --> 31:38.474
We're still not sure what
the hell happened, DiNozzo.

31:38.522 --> 31:40.630
Or if she was even in there
when the place blew up.

31:41.024 --> 31:41.919
Bodies?

31:41.965 --> 31:43.240
No, it was incinerated.

31:43.285 --> 31:46.498
We won't even be able to process
the scene until at least tomorrow.

31:46.755 --> 31:48.977
- What makes you think she was there?
- A tip.

31:49.024 --> 31:50.024
From who?

31:50.534 --> 31:51.548
Anonymous.

31:51.572 --> 31:53.578
My guess is probably somebody

31:53.602 --> 31:55.628
inside Mossad trying to make nice...

31:55.695 --> 31:57.140
Someone tying up loose ends.

31:57.855 --> 31:58.501
Well, for all we know,

31:58.525 --> 32:01.310
she blew up the place
to cover her own tracks.

32:01.364 --> 32:03.484
Well, she was only looking
for the guy who set her up.

32:03.545 --> 32:05.628
You mind telling me how you know that?

32:05.683 --> 32:06.838
'Cause it's what I'd do.

32:14.873 --> 32:15.873
Not good, Ducky.

32:16.623 --> 32:18.270
You did manage to call them, didn't you?

32:18.893 --> 32:20.600
I got Gibbs' voice mail.

32:20.755 --> 32:22.371
I don't think he ever
learned how to use it.

32:22.395 --> 32:24.507
And the number Abby has for Ziva?

32:24.704 --> 32:25.877
Not picking up.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.570
Then, there's only one
thing for you to do.

32:27.594 --> 32:28.208
I know.

32:28.265 --> 32:29.959
We'll let the Director know
they're probably dead and

32:29.983 --> 32:31.769
resign for disobeying a direct order.

32:31.833 --> 32:34.729
You'll do nothing of
the sort, Anthony DiNozzo.

32:39.335 --> 32:40.109
And why is that?

32:40.133 --> 32:42.930
Because the man who did
that is still out there

32:42.954 --> 32:45.577
and I'll be damned if we
let him get away with it.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.287
What would Gibbs do, right?

32:49.584 --> 32:50.864
I got a bulletin for you, Ducky.

32:50.994 --> 32:51.994
I am not Gibbs.

32:52.175 --> 32:54.279
No. You're not.

32:54.854 --> 32:56.290
Gibbs quit.

32:56.454 --> 32:57.948
You're still here.

32:58.174 --> 32:59.890
Why wasn't I with Ziva?

32:59.985 --> 33:01.778
I turned over my responsibility to him

33:01.802 --> 33:03.770
without even thinking about it.

33:05.574 --> 33:07.570
Gibbs is one of the
most capable agents...

33:07.594 --> 33:10.589
Was, Ducky! You didn't see him.

33:10.684 --> 33:11.801
I mean, it didn't even look like Gibbs.

33:11.825 --> 33:13.689
I think he went native down there.

33:13.713 --> 33:14.357
Uh, Tony...

33:14.425 --> 33:16.539
His hair is all long and crazy-looking

33:16.563 --> 33:18.080
and he's got this scraggly beard.

33:18.104 --> 33:20.088
He looks like a pirate or something.

33:20.152 --> 33:21.510
His eyes were all bloodshot,

33:21.534 --> 33:24.347
probably from drinking hooch from
morning till night with Franks.

33:24.384 --> 33:27.138
They call it a red-eye for a reason.

33:30.715 --> 33:33.449
The flight I was on
all night to get here.

33:34.435 --> 33:36.617
Oh, chief, all right.

33:37.795 --> 33:39.197
Good, all right, thank God.

33:39.515 --> 33:41.079
Yeah, thank Ziva.

33:41.475 --> 33:43.310
I've already been blown up twice, Tony.

33:43.334 --> 33:45.160
Don't think I've got a third one in me.

33:45.952 --> 33:47.141
Space 73.

33:47.165 --> 33:49.319
Present's in the back
for autopsy and Abby.

33:49.343 --> 33:50.740
Don't be seen.

33:51.024 --> 33:52.024
Hey ya, Duck.

33:52.214 --> 33:53.169
Welcome home, Jethro.

33:53.193 --> 33:55.000
Oh, you got the wrong guy.

33:55.355 --> 33:56.631
I'm just visiting.

33:56.655 --> 33:58.339
You might want to tell Palmer

33:58.392 --> 33:59.950
it's going to be a late night.

34:07.024 --> 34:08.967
I really missed that view.

34:12.603 --> 34:14.610
Harbor isn't bad either.

34:17.763 --> 34:20.867
I had a feeling I'd be
seeing you soon, Jethro.

34:21.245 --> 34:22.279
How is she?

34:22.592 --> 34:23.810
She's scared,

34:24.164 --> 34:25.828
not that she'll ever admit that.

34:25.911 --> 34:27.091
NCIS can't help her.

34:27.114 --> 34:29.150
Well, see, that's why
I'm here. I'm not NCIS.

34:29.175 --> 34:30.639
I retired, remember?

34:30.725 --> 34:32.347
I shouldn't even be talking to you.

34:32.382 --> 34:35.447
Anyone asks, just tell them
two old partners catching up.

34:35.603 --> 34:37.920
My agency has been harboring

34:37.945 --> 34:40.219
a foreign operative for over a year,

34:40.244 --> 34:44.080
one that I personally vouched
for and insisted we needed.

34:44.202 --> 34:45.679
She didn't do it.

34:45.722 --> 34:47.080
You think I don't know that?

34:47.123 --> 34:49.810
I'm just telling you what they're
saying all over the Beltway.

34:49.893 --> 34:52.617
I give it 24 hours before
they ask for my resignation.

34:53.313 --> 34:54.857
Don't give it to them.

34:54.953 --> 34:55.953
She was set up.

34:56.012 --> 34:57.012
By who?

34:57.072 --> 34:59.408
A former Mossad officer.

34:59.643 --> 35:02.569
Claims it was to get
back at Ziva's father.

35:02.614 --> 35:04.070
What do you think?

35:05.083 --> 35:07.148
My gut says it was more than that.

35:08.182 --> 35:09.208
I agree.

35:09.232 --> 35:12.948
This is bigger than the
director level of NCIS or Mossad.

35:13.704 --> 35:15.470
This incident could jeopardize relations

35:15.494 --> 35:17.809
between both of our countries for years.

35:17.873 --> 35:20.297
I figure someone hired
him to do just that.

35:20.385 --> 35:22.039
Well, I can think of ten countries

35:22.063 --> 35:24.900
and a dozen terrorist
groups that fit that bill.

35:24.945 --> 35:26.799
Oh, yeah. I can, too.

35:26.843 --> 35:28.870
Which is why I want
you to do me a favor.

35:29.155 --> 35:30.155
Name it.

35:30.593 --> 35:31.758
It's late.

35:32.593 --> 35:35.440
Go home, catch up on some sleep.

35:35.835 --> 35:37.438
Plausible deniability.

35:37.872 --> 35:38.940
Yeah.

35:39.862 --> 35:41.490
Something like that.

35:43.324 --> 35:44.397
Thank you.

35:45.282 --> 35:48.118
- Jethro, it's good to...
- I'm not back, Jen.

35:48.182 --> 35:50.537
I'm just doing a favor for a friend.

35:51.105 --> 35:54.138
I was just talking about your hair.

35:55.303 --> 35:57.460
It's good to see it long again.

35:57.552 --> 36:00.420
Reminds me of when we
were undercover in Serbia.

36:00.625 --> 36:01.880
Serbia?

36:02.392 --> 36:05.589
Do you rember that little
farmhouse we were holed up in?

36:06.334 --> 36:09.047
A whole week with nothing to do, but...

36:10.054 --> 36:12.148
No. No, I don't, Jen.

36:13.212 --> 36:16.238
Memory is a little fuzzy on some things.

36:47.142 --> 36:49.360
We matched the dead guy's prints.

36:49.973 --> 36:51.598
Balash Sassnio.

36:51.622 --> 36:53.658
Arrested five years ago
for reckless driving.

36:53.682 --> 36:55.141
An illegal from Iran.

36:55.165 --> 36:57.539
Student visa expired last year, boss.

36:57.565 --> 36:58.910
Good job, McGee.

36:59.045 --> 37:00.668
What about the cell phone
Eschel called us on, Abs?

37:00.692 --> 37:03.271
I isolated the grid
the call came in from.

37:03.295 --> 37:04.507
Nice work, Abs.

37:04.574 --> 37:06.470
Actually, no, Tony.

37:06.572 --> 37:09.567
The grid includes the entire
city of Woodbridge, Virginia.

37:09.633 --> 37:10.660
He could be anywhere in it.

37:10.684 --> 37:11.917
Great. We've got nothing.

37:11.962 --> 37:16.459
Well, an ex-Mossad officer workin with
an Iranian student is something, Gibbs.

37:16.675 --> 37:19.057
Not if it doesn't help
us find Eschel in time.

37:19.395 --> 37:21.660
McGee, the BOLO we put out yesterday.

37:22.044 --> 37:23.378
Any hits?

37:23.753 --> 37:26.557
You completely forgot
about that, didn't you?

37:26.953 --> 37:28.568
This one's on me, boss.

37:32.823 --> 37:34.689
We have multiple hits.

37:34.952 --> 37:37.110
Six hits on men fitting
his general description.

37:37.134 --> 37:39.280
Three in Delaware, one in Pennsylvania,

37:39.343 --> 37:40.100
two in Virginia.

37:40.124 --> 37:42.427
Closest match a local cop saw a man

37:42.492 --> 37:45.067
fitting his exact
profile at a Freemont Inn.

37:45.142 --> 37:46.142
Where, McGee?

37:46.224 --> 37:47.510
Woodbridge, Virginia.

37:50.403 --> 37:51.900
I'm telling you, Gibbs, don't call her.

37:51.924 --> 37:52.931
She won't wait for us.

37:52.955 --> 37:54.628
She will if I tell her to.

38:01.252 --> 38:02.252
You found him?

38:02.434 --> 38:04.459
The Freemont Inn in Woodbridge.

38:04.564 --> 38:05.419
We'll swing by and pick you up.

38:05.443 --> 38:06.370
There's no time, Gibbs.

38:06.454 --> 38:08.291
He won't stay in one place
for more than 24 hours.

38:08.315 --> 38:11.388
I'll meet you there.
Ziva, this isn't a debate.

38:11.433 --> 38:13.360
We go in together or we don't go...

38:15.615 --> 38:17.030
Let me guess, she's going without us?

38:17.054 --> 38:18.218
If she kills him,

38:18.394 --> 38:20.390
there won't be any way to prove
the Israelis weren't behind this.

38:20.414 --> 38:21.530
Yeah, I know. Let's roll.

38:21.554 --> 38:23.420
- Hey.
- Hey! No.

38:23.444 --> 38:25.628
This is my team now, Gibbs. My rules.

38:25.652 --> 38:27.110
And DiNozzo's rule number one?

38:27.134 --> 38:29.798
I don't sit on the sidelines
when my people are in trouble.

38:29.922 --> 38:31.320
You got a problem with that?

38:31.524 --> 38:33.310
Then let's remember who's got
the badge and who's a civilian.

38:33.334 --> 38:33.979
You done?

38:34.003 --> 38:35.210
Yeah.

38:36.112 --> 38:38.237
I was going to say...

38:38.304 --> 38:40.888
"Get McGee. I'll meet you there."

38:42.893 --> 38:45.667
You know, I could arrest you
for striking a federal officer.

38:45.875 --> 38:47.188
I know that.

38:49.142 --> 38:50.789
All right.

38:51.452 --> 38:52.919
Just so you know.

39:01.425 --> 39:05.330
I trust the rest of my money will
be wired into my account shortly?

39:05.432 --> 39:06.507
Of course.

39:09.312 --> 39:10.850
Would you mind?

39:16.395 --> 39:19.528
Careful, it's delicate.

39:28.003 --> 39:29.348
I'm sorry,

39:29.383 --> 39:32.388
but no one can know my
country was behind this, Eschel.

39:39.573 --> 39:40.868
And with you gone,

39:41.083 --> 39:42.649
no one will.

40:11.845 --> 40:13.150
Who hired you?

40:13.473 --> 40:14.988
Mossad.

40:15.084 --> 40:16.640
Liar. Who?

40:16.963 --> 40:20.700
Go on, do it. You'll never make me talk.

40:22.505 --> 40:23.787
I believe you.

40:24.325 --> 40:25.820
Then, kill me.

40:26.312 --> 40:28.128
Make your daddy proud,

40:28.394 --> 40:29.767
Jew.

40:33.712 --> 40:34.580
What are you doing?

40:34.604 --> 40:37.287
Not making you a martyr.
You're under arrest.

40:37.374 --> 40:39.608
Your time with the
Americans has made you soft.

40:39.652 --> 40:41.747
You should not have
thrown your knife away.

40:49.534 --> 40:50.958
Get up.

40:58.382 --> 40:59.509
Not so tough now,

40:59.533 --> 41:01.049
are you?

41:11.093 --> 41:14.600
I thought I told you to get up!

41:16.774 --> 41:17.588
Who are you?

41:17.612 --> 41:19.398
VEVAK.

41:19.483 --> 41:20.828
Iranian intelligence?

41:20.862 --> 41:23.259
Yes, and you have our thanks.

41:23.322 --> 41:26.159
The Americans will never
trust your country again.

41:28.194 --> 41:29.990
It was easier than I thought.

41:30.385 --> 41:31.968
Making you talk.

41:42.373 --> 41:43.407
Ziva, you okay?

41:44.043 --> 41:45.409
I'm okay, McGee.

41:47.355 --> 41:48.969
You should have waited.

41:51.654 --> 41:52.839
Who's she?

41:53.505 --> 41:54.840
Iranian intelligence.

41:55.224 --> 41:56.518
They were behind it all.

41:56.633 --> 41:58.168
How do you plan on proving that?

41:58.725 --> 42:00.909
I've been with NCIS for a year.

42:01.313 --> 42:03.229
I'm not just a killer anymore.

42:06.865 --> 42:08.560
I'm an investigator.

42:11.235 --> 42:12.907
Now, can I go home?

42:13.515 --> 42:17.149
The FBI reports they've
apprehended the Iranian terrorist

42:17.193 --> 42:20.228
believed to be responsible for
the death of two of their agents.

42:20.273 --> 42:23.238
Two other terrorists were
also killed in a standoff

42:23.283 --> 42:25.839
with federal authorities
in Northern Virginia...

42:25.915 --> 42:27.800
Federal authorities?

42:28.223 --> 42:29.278
They mean us.

42:29.365 --> 42:30.688
Four stinking letters.

42:30.755 --> 42:31.755
N-C-I-S.

42:31.812 --> 42:34.248
It's either that story, Tony, or
the FBI charges you

42:34.272 --> 42:36.770
with interfering in their investigation.

42:37.443 --> 42:39.488
I can live with "federal authorities."

42:40.904 --> 42:43.097
Welcome home, Ziva.

42:43.484 --> 42:47.027
Well, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Gibbs.

42:47.222 --> 42:48.222
And me.

42:49.414 --> 42:52.220
True, but, uh, mostly Gibbs.

42:52.803 --> 42:54.600
Speaking of which...

42:55.494 --> 42:56.980
He's in the squad room.

43:04.984 --> 43:07.129
Where is he, McGee? Abby's lab?

43:08.375 --> 43:10.449
Gibbs left, ma'am.

43:10.962 --> 43:12.580
Said he had a plane to catch.

43:12.604 --> 43:14.207
You sure about that, McGee?

43:14.352 --> 43:16.129
Yeah, Tony, I'm sure.

43:16.513 --> 43:19.079
No. 'Cause he didn't
even say good-bye to me.

43:21.082 --> 43:24.117
Director, uh, he wanted
me to give this to you.

43:29.813 --> 43:31.270
Ah, nice snap.

43:31.353 --> 43:32.728
Where was that taken?

43:32.772 --> 43:34.070
Serbia.

43:34.745 --> 43:35.745
When?

43:36.403 --> 43:38.708
A lifetime ago, Ziva.
