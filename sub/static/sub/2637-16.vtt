WEBVTT

00:02.461 --> 00:04.444
- Take him down!
- He's got you, Sheldon.

00:04.564 --> 00:06.943
- Look at this move!
- He's completely schooling you.

00:07.063 --> 00:10.232
Hey, guys, some of the other waitresses
wanted me to ask you something.

00:10.352 --> 00:11.681
It's called Tresling.

00:11.841 --> 00:13.995
It combines the physical strength
of arm wrestling

00:14.115 --> 00:17.312
with the mental agility of Tetris
into the ultimate sport.

00:17.472 --> 00:19.592
That's terrific,
but they wanted me to ask you

00:19.712 --> 00:21.274
to cut it the hell out.

00:21.435 --> 00:23.211
Great. Come here, guys. Come on.

00:23.523 --> 00:27.405
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

00:27.567 --> 00:30.673
We might as well stop. It's a stalemate.
You're beating me in Tetris,

00:30.793 --> 00:33.620
but you've got the upper body
strength of a Keebler elf.

00:33.780 --> 00:36.081
Keebler elf?
I've got your Keebler elf right here.

00:41.120 --> 00:42.736
Okay, it's a stalemate.

00:44.829 --> 00:46.925
So, Leonard, will we be
seeing you on Saturday

00:47.086 --> 00:49.695
- for your free birthday cheesecake?
- He can't eat cheesecake.

00:49.815 --> 00:52.430
- He's lactose intolerant.
- He can have carrot cake.

00:52.591 --> 00:55.475
- What about the cream cheese frosting?
- He can scrape it off.

00:56.940 --> 00:59.646
Forget about the cake.
How do you know my birthday's Saturday?

00:59.807 --> 01:02.395
I did your horoscope, remember?
I was gonna do everybody's,

01:02.515 --> 01:04.943
until Sheldon went on
one of his typical psychotic rants.

01:05.952 --> 01:09.315
For the record, "that psychotic rant"
was a concise summation

01:09.435 --> 01:13.243
of the research of Bertram Forer,
who, in 1948, proved conclusively

01:13.404 --> 01:15.262
through meticulously
designed experiments

01:15.382 --> 01:17.747
that astrology is nothing
but pseudo-scientific hokum.

01:17.908 --> 01:19.707
Blah, blah, blah. Typical Taurus.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.751
Are we gonna see you Saturday?

01:22.913 --> 01:24.545
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

01:24.707 --> 01:27.257
- I don't celebrate my birthday.
- Shut up. Yeah, you do.

01:27.417 --> 01:29.551
It's no big deal;
it's just the way I was raised.

01:29.866 --> 01:32.178
My parents focused
on celebrating achievements,

01:32.340 --> 01:35.473
and being expelled from a birth canal
was not considered one of them.

01:36.746 --> 01:37.984
That's so silly.

01:38.104 --> 01:40.262
It's actually based
on very sound theories.

01:40.382 --> 01:43.103
- His mother published a paper on it.
- What was it called?

01:43.223 --> 01:45.399
"I Hate My Son
and That's Why He Can't Have Cake"?

01:46.654 --> 01:48.153
It was obviously effective.

01:48.314 --> 01:50.457
Leonard grew up to be
an experimental physicist.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.501
Perhaps if she'd also denied him
Christmas,

01:52.621 --> 01:54.139
he'd be a little better at it.

01:55.314 --> 01:57.078
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:57.239 --> 01:58.533
Well, I love birthdays.

01:58.653 --> 02:01.371
Waking up to Mom's special
French toast breakfast,

02:01.491 --> 02:03.101
wearing the birthday king crown,

02:03.221 --> 02:05.044
playing laser tag with all my friends...

02:05.205 --> 02:07.255
Yeah, see?
That's what kids should have.

02:07.416 --> 02:09.192
Actually, that was last year.

02:12.913 --> 02:16.055
So you really never had
a birthday party?

02:16.257 --> 02:19.351
No, but it was okay.
When I was little, I'd think

02:19.471 --> 02:22.409
maybe my parents would change their mind
and surprise me with a party.

02:22.529 --> 02:24.856
Like this one birthday
I came home from my cello lesson

02:25.017 --> 02:27.220
and I saw a lot of strange
cars parked out front.

02:27.340 --> 02:29.646
When I got to the door,
I could hear people whispering

02:29.766 --> 02:32.697
and I could smell German chocolate cake,
which is my favorite.

02:33.813 --> 02:34.574
And?

02:34.735 --> 02:36.765
It turns out my grandfather had died.

02:38.213 --> 02:40.371
Oh, my God. That's terrible.

02:40.533 --> 02:42.749
Well, it was kind
of like a birthday party.

02:43.658 --> 02:46.781
I got to see all my cousins,
and there was cake, so...

02:48.095 --> 02:49.922
It's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

02:50.083 --> 02:50.924
You think?

02:51.085 --> 02:53.134
Go ahead, tell her about
your senior prom.

02:55.892 --> 02:58.349

03:20.737 --> 03:22.617
Make sure they remember, no peanuts.

03:22.737 --> 03:26.245
Howard, every Thai restaurant in town
knows you can't eat peanuts.

03:27.349 --> 03:30.379
When they see me coming,
they go, "Ah, no-peanut boy!"

03:41.808 --> 03:45.143
- Hello, Penny. Leonard just left.
- I know. I want to talk to you.

03:45.671 --> 03:46.979
What would we talk about?

03:47.637 --> 03:49.756
We have no overlapping
areas of interest I'm aware of.

03:49.876 --> 03:51.759
As you know, I don't care for chitchat.

03:52.130 --> 03:53.918
- Can you just let me in?
- All right,

03:54.038 --> 03:56.092
but I don't see this
as a promising endeavor.

03:57.954 --> 04:00.701
Here's the deal. We're gonna throw
Leonard a kick-ass surprise party

04:00.862 --> 04:03.275
- for his birthday on Saturday.
- I hardly think so.

04:03.395 --> 04:05.497
Leonard made it very clear
he doesn't want a party.

04:05.659 --> 04:08.693
Did someone say... "party"?

04:09.460 --> 04:12.572
He just doesn't know he wants
one 'cause he's never had one.

04:12.692 --> 04:14.730
I suppose that's possible,
but for the record,

04:14.850 --> 04:17.510
I've never had a threesome
and yet I still know I want one.

04:19.966 --> 04:22.495
Howard, here's the difference...
The possibility exists

04:22.615 --> 04:25.852
that Leonard could have a birthday party
before hell freezes over.

04:28.057 --> 04:30.773
Fine. If I do have a threesome,
you can't be part of it.

04:32.603 --> 04:34.276
I'm just kidding. Yes, you can.

04:35.521 --> 04:37.096
Can you bring a friend?

04:39.271 --> 04:41.703
I think a birthday party's
a terrible idea.

04:41.823 --> 04:44.718
I envy Leonard for growing up
without that anguish.

04:44.838 --> 04:45.710
Anguish?!

04:45.830 --> 04:47.872
Year after year, I had to endure

04:48.034 --> 04:50.181
wearing comical hats while being forced

04:50.301 --> 04:52.648
into the crowded, sweaty
hell of bouncy castles.

04:52.768 --> 04:54.565
Not to mention being blindfolded

04:54.685 --> 04:56.827
and spun toward a grotesque
tailless donkey

04:56.947 --> 04:59.276
as the other children mocked
my disorientation.

05:00.755 --> 05:02.220
Okay, sweetie, I understand

05:02.382 --> 05:04.931
you have scars
that no nonprofessional can heal,

05:05.367 --> 05:08.018
but, nevertheless, we're going
to throw Leonard a birthday party.

05:08.180 --> 05:10.588
Have I pointed out that I'm extremely
uncomfortable with dancing,

05:10.708 --> 05:13.607
loud music and most other forms
of alcohol-induced frivolity?

05:15.255 --> 05:17.059
- Nevertheless...
- In addition, I...

05:17.179 --> 05:18.236
Here's the deal:

05:18.399 --> 05:21.630
You either help me throw a birthday
party or I will go into your bedroom

05:21.750 --> 05:24.307
and unbag all of your most valuable
mint-condition comic books.

05:24.427 --> 05:26.246
And on one of them,
you won't know which,

05:26.366 --> 05:28.289
I'll draw a tiny happy face in ink.

05:30.792 --> 05:33.752
You can't do that. If you make a mark
in a mint comic, it's no longer mint.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.006
Do you understand
the concept of blackmail?

05:37.168 --> 05:38.617
Well, of course, I...

05:41.520 --> 05:44.637
I have an idea. Let's throw Leonard
a kick-ass birthday party.

06:04.551 --> 06:06.068
That's not the secret knock.

06:07.823 --> 06:09.465
This is the secret knock.

06:13.259 --> 06:14.710
What difference does it make?

06:14.872 --> 06:17.999
The whole point of a secret knock
is to establish a non-verbal signal

06:18.119 --> 06:20.891
to verify the identity
of one's co-conspirators.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.183
- Is that Raj and Howard?
- Possibly, but unverified.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.277
Will you just let us in.

06:26.397 --> 06:29.112
Luckily for you,
this is not a nuclear reactor.

06:29.687 --> 06:32.811
- So what'd you get the birthday boy?
- Well, Raj got him an awesome,

06:32.974 --> 06:36.401
limited edition Dark Knight sculpture
based on Alex Ross's definitive Batman.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.460
And I got him this amazing
autographed copy

06:38.580 --> 06:40.319
of <i>The Feynman Lectures on Physics</i>.

06:40.840 --> 06:41.676
Nice.

06:42.176 --> 06:43.591
I got him a sweater.

06:44.745 --> 06:47.665
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.

06:49.255 --> 06:52.373
- Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
- That's because I didn't bring one.

06:52.535 --> 06:53.847
- Why not?
- Don't ask.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.877
The entire institution
of gift-giving makes no sense.

06:57.038 --> 06:58.848
- Too late.
- Let's say I go out

06:58.968 --> 07:00.566
and I spend $50 on you.

07:00.686 --> 07:03.509
It's a laborious activity
because I have to imagine what you need,

07:03.671 --> 07:05.260
whereas you know what you need.

07:05.423 --> 07:08.555
Now, I could simplify things...
just give you the $50 directly,

07:08.718 --> 07:10.266
and then you could give me $50

07:10.467 --> 07:12.895
on my birthday, and so on,
until one of us dies,

07:13.015 --> 07:15.429
leaving the other one old
and $50 richer.

07:17.893 --> 07:19.799
And I ask you, is it worth it?

07:21.097 --> 07:22.477
Told you not to ask.

07:23.265 --> 07:26.490
Sheldon, you're his friend.
Friends give each other presents.

07:26.977 --> 07:29.076
I accept your premise;
I reject your conclusion.

07:31.351 --> 07:34.790
Try telling him
it's a non-optional social convention.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.891
- What?
- Just do it.

07:39.790 --> 07:43.048
It's a non-optional...
social convention.

07:44.303 --> 07:45.665
Oh. Fair enough.

07:49.383 --> 07:50.947
He came with a manual.

07:52.280 --> 07:55.185
Question. How am I going to get Leonard
a present before the party?

07:55.517 --> 07:58.276
I don't drive and the only things
available within walking distance

07:58.396 --> 08:00.239
are a Thai restaurant and a gas station.

08:00.359 --> 08:02.393
I suppose I could wrap up
an order of mee krob

08:02.513 --> 08:04.230
and a couple of lottery scratchers.

08:04.935 --> 08:06.206
Okay let's do this...

08:06.326 --> 08:09.386
I will drive Sheldon to get a present.
Howard, you need to get rid of Leonard

08:09.506 --> 08:11.159
- for about 2 hours.
- No problem.

08:11.371 --> 08:14.623
And then, Raj, you bring the stuff
across the hall and start setting up.

08:15.677 --> 08:17.039
What if guests show up?

08:17.563 --> 08:18.835
Entertain them.

08:19.568 --> 08:21.080
What if they're women?

08:22.523 --> 08:24.757
Stare at them and make them
feel uncomfortable.

08:37.936 --> 08:39.846
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

08:40.876 --> 08:44.150
So listen, the NuArt
is showing the revised,

08:44.312 --> 08:46.236
definitive cut of <i>Blade Runner</i>.

08:46.397 --> 08:47.279
Seen it.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.152
No, you've seen
the 25th Anniversary Final Cut.

08:51.006 --> 08:53.952
This one has eight seconds
of previously unseen footage.

08:54.115 --> 08:56.789
They say it completely changes
the tone of the film.

08:57.567 --> 08:58.373
Pass.

08:59.220 --> 09:03.189
Come on. Afterwards, there's a Q & A
with Harrison Ford's body double.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.572
Look, I'm in the Halo
battle of my life here.

09:06.692 --> 09:09.104
There's this kid in Copenhagen...
he has no immune system,

09:09.224 --> 09:12.262
so all he does is sit in his bubble
and play Halo 24-seven.

09:13.305 --> 09:17.037
- Can't you play him some other time?
- Not if you believe his doctors.

09:20.912 --> 09:22.760
Oh, my God, do you smell gas?

09:24.267 --> 09:25.703
- No.
- Yeah, no.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.491
They have DVDs over there.

09:32.652 --> 09:35.376
Yes, but they have
DVD burners over here.

09:36.688 --> 09:38.682
Leonard needs a DVD burner.

09:39.737 --> 09:43.293
A gift shouldn't be something someone
needs, it should be something fun.

09:43.454 --> 09:45.591
Something
they wouldn't buy for themself.

09:45.797 --> 09:47.509
You mean like a sweater?

09:50.603 --> 09:52.094
It's a fun sweater.

09:52.256 --> 09:54.346
It's got a bold geometric print.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.098
Is it the geometry that makes it fun?

09:58.178 --> 10:00.843
The point is one of the ways
we show we care about people

10:00.963 --> 10:03.856
is by putting thought and imagination
into the gifts we give them.

10:04.540 --> 10:07.484
Okay, I see. So, not a DVD burner.

10:08.193 --> 10:08.968
Exactly.

10:09.088 --> 10:11.736
Something he wouldn't buy for himself,
something fun,

10:11.856 --> 10:15.063
Something like...
An 802-11n wireless router!

10:19.532 --> 10:21.410
Here you go, Copenhagen boy.

10:21.530 --> 10:24.313
How about a taste
of Hans Christian hand grenade?

10:27.531 --> 10:28.999
That could not feel good.

10:32.388 --> 10:34.589
Come on, come... Oh, you clever...

10:39.133 --> 10:40.116
Come on.

10:41.442 --> 10:42.467
Take that!

10:49.562 --> 10:52.029
- What's the matter?
- This granola bar has peanuts in it!

10:52.191 --> 10:55.694
- Oh, my God. Why did you eat it?
- I don't know. It was just there!

10:56.026 --> 10:58.837
If I had a gun there,
would you have shot yourself?

10:59.567 --> 11:02.247
Don't yell at me!
I've got to go to the emergency room!

11:02.409 --> 11:04.602
- Now?!
- No, after my tongue has swollen

11:04.722 --> 11:06.251
to the size of a brisket!

11:07.155 --> 11:09.504
All right, just let me get my keys.

11:10.012 --> 11:11.752
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

11:13.254 --> 11:15.427
The laundry is out of the hamper.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.496
Okay, Sheldon,
what was it supposed to be?

11:22.601 --> 11:24.474
Fine. It's out of the washer!

11:25.380 --> 11:27.532
I'll call you when it's in the dryer.

11:28.428 --> 11:29.835
All right, let's go.

11:41.855 --> 11:44.081
- What do you think?
- That one.

11:44.242 --> 11:46.544
Because of the two
additional Ethernet ports?

11:46.664 --> 11:47.829
- Sure.
- No need,

11:47.949 --> 11:50.046
he's already got
a six-port Ethernet switch.

11:50.166 --> 11:51.757
- Okay, then this one.
- Why?

11:52.079 --> 11:54.623
I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.

11:55.420 --> 11:58.596
Penny, if I'm going to buy Leonard
a gift, I'm going to do it right.

11:58.932 --> 12:01.850
I refuse to let him experience
the same childhood trauma I did.

12:02.721 --> 12:05.253
I know I'm gonna regret this,
but: What trauma?

12:07.047 --> 12:08.314
On my 12th birthday,

12:08.475 --> 12:10.738
I really wanted a titanium centrifuge

12:10.858 --> 12:13.443
so, you know,
I could separate radioactive isotopes.

12:13.983 --> 12:14.922
Of course.

12:15.186 --> 12:18.493
Instead of a titanium centrifuge,
my parents bought me...

12:19.443 --> 12:20.527
This is hard.

12:21.692 --> 12:22.720
They got me

12:23.291 --> 12:24.784
a motorized dirt bike.

12:28.919 --> 12:31.714
What 12-year-old boy wants
a motorized dirt bike?

12:33.362 --> 12:34.416
All of them?

12:34.935 --> 12:36.133
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:39.785 --> 12:41.150
So we're getting this one?

12:41.270 --> 12:43.366
- Yeah, I suppose.
- All right, let's go.

12:44.001 --> 12:46.478
Excuse me.
Do you know anything about this stuff?

12:46.896 --> 12:48.855
I know everything about this stuff.

12:49.016 --> 12:51.649
Okay, I have my own
wholesale flower business

12:51.810 --> 12:54.122
and I want to hook up
my computer in the front entrance

12:54.242 --> 12:56.189
with the one in my
refrigerated warehouse.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.750
Buy this one:
it's the one we're getting. Happy guy.

12:58.870 --> 13:00.319
No, she doesn't want that.

13:00.439 --> 13:04.360
She needs a point-to-point
peer network with a range extender.

13:04.686 --> 13:05.646
Thank you.

13:05.766 --> 13:07.518
Which hard drive do I want...

13:07.638 --> 13:09.334
firewire or USB?

13:09.494 --> 13:11.501
It depends on what buss
you have available.

13:15.441 --> 13:17.612
I drive a Chevy Cavalier.

13:19.292 --> 13:20.719
Oh, dear Lord.

13:20.882 --> 13:22.429
- We have to go.
- Not now.

13:22.632 --> 13:25.599
This poor man needs me.
You, hold on. I'll be right with you.

13:26.225 --> 13:29.501
What computer do you have?
And please don't say "a white one."

13:35.604 --> 13:38.029
- Excuse me.
- Fill this out. Have a seat.

13:38.191 --> 13:40.382
Listen. We're throwing
my friend a surprise party

13:40.502 --> 13:42.940
I'm supposed to keep him out
of his apartment for 2 hours.

13:43.313 --> 13:44.869
Fill this out and have a seat.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.947
No, the only way I could
get him to leave

13:47.067 --> 13:49.707
was to tell him I ate a peanut
because I'm allergic to peanuts.

13:49.869 --> 13:52.667
Well, in that case,
fill this out and have a seat.

13:53.904 --> 13:56.645
All I need from you is to take me
in the back and give me a Band-Aid

13:56.765 --> 13:59.293
so I can pretend I had a shot of
epinephrine, and you tell my friend

13:59.413 --> 14:01.474
you need to keep me under observation
for 1 hour 1/2.

14:01.594 --> 14:02.998
- Is that all you need?
- Yes.

14:03.118 --> 14:04.514
Get out of my ER.

14:05.475 --> 14:08.320
- No, you don't understand.
- I understand, but unfortunately,

14:08.440 --> 14:11.061
this hospital is not equipped
to treat stupid.

14:12.814 --> 14:15.199
Okay, I get it.
I know how the world works.

14:15.465 --> 14:17.675
How about if I were to introduce to you

14:18.116 --> 14:20.252
to the man who freed your people?

14:25.051 --> 14:27.532
Unless my people were freed
by Benjamin Franklin

14:27.652 --> 14:30.164
and his five twin brothers,
you are wasting your time.

14:32.823 --> 14:34.795
Sorry, I couldn't find a parking spot.

14:34.915 --> 14:37.039
- How are you doing?
- Bad, very bad.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.455
Really? You don't look like
you're swelling up at all.

14:39.575 --> 14:42.010
We should just pick up some Benadryl
at the drugstore and go home.

14:42.170 --> 14:44.252
- We can't go home.
- Why not?

14:44.759 --> 14:45.993
Because...

14:46.707 --> 14:47.824
because...

14:48.774 --> 14:50.392
Brisket! Brisket!

14:51.951 --> 14:54.382
- Water! Need water!
- I'll be right back.

14:59.297 --> 15:00.527
I've got a problem.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.482
Well, so do I.
You gotta stall Leonard a little longer.

15:03.692 --> 15:05.420
- I don't think I can.
- You have to.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.795
We all have to be there
at the same time to yell surprise.

15:07.915 --> 15:10.662
You have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.

15:10.867 --> 15:13.897
- Why? Is Leonard okay?
- Leonard's fine. I'm fine.

15:14.017 --> 15:15.667
Thanks for asking, by the way.

15:16.146 --> 15:19.274
Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Just hold him there a little longer.

15:19.394 --> 15:22.382
I've done my best, but he wants to go
home and I don't know how to stop him.

15:23.388 --> 15:25.850
Okay, how about this?
You keep him there a little longer,

15:25.970 --> 15:28.998
and when you get to the party, I'll
point out which of my friends are easy?

15:38.820 --> 15:40.613
Don't toy with me, woman.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.654
I got a hot former fat girl
with no self-esteem,

15:44.816 --> 15:46.954
a girl who punishes her father
by sleeping around

15:47.074 --> 15:50.941
a alcoholic who's 2 tequila shots away
from letting you wear her like a hat.

15:52.807 --> 15:54.164
Thy will be done.

16:04.708 --> 16:06.849
I'm doing this for you, little buddy.

16:13.062 --> 16:15.193
Okay, we don't have that in stock...

16:16.723 --> 16:19.121
but I can special-order it for you.

16:19.830 --> 16:20.602
Him.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.860
Excuse me, sir.
You don't work here.

16:24.919 --> 16:27.197
Yes, well, apparently,
neither does anyone else.

16:28.742 --> 16:30.702
- Sheldon, we have to go.
- Why?

16:30.863 --> 16:33.411
For one thing, we're late for
Leonard's birthday party,

16:33.531 --> 16:35.540
and for another,
I told him to call security.

16:37.070 --> 16:38.234
Good luck.

16:40.455 --> 16:43.052
By the way, a six-year-old
could hack your computer system.

16:43.172 --> 16:44.281
Keep walking.

16:44.401 --> 16:46.663
"1234" is not a secure password.

16:49.566 --> 16:52.470
Excuse me, my friend is having
an allergic reaction to peanuts.

16:52.783 --> 16:54.643
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is.

16:54.803 --> 16:57.193
Look, sir, we are very
busy here, and I...

16:57.578 --> 16:59.230
Holy crap!

17:00.647 --> 17:01.933
Please help me!

17:03.118 --> 17:04.733
Code four! I need a gurney!

17:06.262 --> 17:08.277
- Right away! Right away!
- Thank you.

17:12.452 --> 17:15.031
Say what you will about the
healthcare system in this country,

17:15.151 --> 17:18.270
but when they're afraid of lawsuits,
they sure test everything.

17:19.165 --> 17:22.189
I really don't think
the colonoscopy was necessary.

17:24.749 --> 17:26.674
You know, before you got all swollen up,

17:26.794 --> 17:29.490
I actually thought you were trying
to keep me out of the apartment

17:29.610 --> 17:31.641
so you could throw me a surprise party.

17:32.245 --> 17:35.016
Right, it's your birthday.
I had no idea it was your birthday.

17:35.176 --> 17:37.614
I completely forgot.
What a lousy way to spend a birthday.

17:37.734 --> 17:39.083
It's all over now.

17:42.892 --> 17:44.442
There is a party, isn't there?

17:45.558 --> 17:46.418
Maybe.

17:49.873 --> 17:52.720
- Are you mad?
- How could I be mad?

17:53.182 --> 17:56.787
You actually risked your life
because you care about me.

17:58.226 --> 17:59.945
Yeah, that's why I did it.

18:02.957 --> 18:03.913
All right.

18:04.868 --> 18:05.843
Here we go.

18:06.934 --> 18:08.726
My first birthday party.

18:18.956 --> 18:19.873
Dude,

18:20.504 --> 18:22.312
everybody left an hour ago.

18:25.016 --> 18:26.353
Surprise!

18:32.568 --> 18:35.619
Okay, Leonard.
I am at your birthday party.

18:35.936 --> 18:39.246
I don't know where you are,
dude, but it's really kick-ass!

18:40.018 --> 18:42.954
Everyone is very, very drunk and...

18:45.023 --> 18:47.886
And look,
there's a girl taking her shirt off!

18:49.621 --> 18:51.236
That's my friend Carol.

18:51.579 --> 18:54.136
Remind me,
I gotta introduce her to Howard.

18:54.782 --> 18:58.118
Oh, sweet Krishna,
shake that rupee maker!

19:00.350 --> 19:02.682
I'm so sorry you didn't get your party.

19:03.085 --> 19:04.133
It's okay.

19:06.548 --> 19:08.082
Happy birthday, anyways.

19:16.610 --> 19:20.176
When's your birthday?
