Hey, Ma.

06:00.091 --> 06:01.793
Any luck?

06:03.461 --> 06:05.697
I didn't see shit.

06:06.965 --> 06:09.969
Heard Rhodes shot a
fourteen pointer yesterday.

06:10.468 --> 06:11.302

Ya'll heading back to the house?

06:23.148 --> 06:25.150

06:26.083 --> 06:29.689
What are you trying to do?
Give me a fucking heart attack!

06:30.956 --> 06:33.992
Just making sure
you ain't dead!

06:35.025 --> 06:36.828
Don't you say that.

06:36.862 --> 06:38.698
Get in.

07:23.441 --> 07:27.313
Listen I'm gonna go freshen up.
Who's coming with me?

07:27.545 --> 07:31.750
Someday, Noah, when you have
a wife, you'll understand.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.119
Think of it this way.

07:34.151 --> 07:36.888
Mama's not happy.
Nobodies happy.

07:38.088 --> 07:41.059
It's your father's birthday.

08:56.635 --> 08:58.470
Hey!

08:58.502 --> 08:59.937
-Hey.
-Yo.

08:59.971 --> 09:01.974
What's going on yo?

09:05.543 --> 09:08.848
When you start gettin'
home from work so early?

09:09.647 --> 09:12.283
It's been the same
time for awhile now.

09:12.317 --> 09:13.652
-Ya?
-Yep.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.253
They don't give ya no overtime?

09:15.286 --> 09:17.588
-Not anymore.
-That's messed up.

09:17.622 --> 09:19.491
Hey, man you
think you could

09:19.524 --> 09:22.160
clean that kitchen up
later? It's a trainwreck.

09:22.193 --> 09:23.929
Yeah man I'm right on it.

09:23.962 --> 09:25.965
We need detergent.

09:26.463 --> 09:28.467
What you working on?

09:29.067 --> 09:30.402
You'll see.

09:50.454 --> 09:53.458
Hey, Noah Daly, good to see ya.

09:53.692 --> 09:57.529
Hey, I got your money
for those chairs.

09:57.561 --> 10:01.999
I was gonna see if we
could work something out Bill.

10:02.032 --> 10:05.169
Ok, no problemo.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.939
So how are things?

10:07.973 --> 10:09.675
Can't complain.

10:09.708 --> 10:12.177
Even if I did nobody'd listen.

10:12.376 --> 10:15.146
So what kind of
project you working on?

10:15.179 --> 10:18.684
Around the house
stuff, nothing really.

10:18.717 --> 10:22.187
You know last year, he made
a hutch for my wife,

10:22.219 --> 10:24.422
woman won't shut up about it.

10:24.455 --> 10:28.025
She decorated with
that glass angel shit.

10:28.059 --> 10:30.728
They're called figurines.

10:30.761 --> 10:34.232
They're called figurines,
and I like em'.

10:34.265 --> 10:37.468
Different strokes for
different folks I guess.

10:38.370 --> 10:42.975
Well, I admire folks that
work with their hands.

10:43.007 --> 10:45.109
It's gettin' to be a lost art.

10:47.245 --> 10:50.349
-You tell Linda I said hi.
-Will do.

10:51.216 --> 10:53.352
You have a good day!

11:24.815 --> 11:26.050
Noah.

11:28.453 --> 11:29.722
Noah.

11:31.122 --> 11:32.690
What's going on?

11:33.791 --> 11:36.194
Why don't ya have a seat?

11:52.709 --> 11:54.412
You order yet?

11:57.615 --> 11:59.751
Pay for the coffee rookie.

12:05.857 --> 12:09.160
There's no easy way
to really say this.

12:09.194 --> 12:12.030
-We
-We what?

12:12.697 --> 12:14.700
We found Lauren.

12:16.601 --> 12:20.172
Dad, Lauren forgot
my chess piece!

12:20.438 --> 12:21.540
You sure?

12:21.573 --> 12:24.208
She's in her castle, daddy.

12:24.476 --> 12:26.144
Can I go get it fast?

12:26.176 --> 12:29.180
No son I'll go get her.
I'm faster than you anyway.

12:29.213 --> 12:31.282
Yeah right, you're old.

12:31.315 --> 12:32.583
Get up.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.723
Hold on to those,
watch your sister.

12:40.357 --> 12:42.327
Where was she?

12:42.359 --> 12:45.596
Bout' fifteen miles from here,
diner on twenty.

12:52.203 --> 12:53.438
What's that?

12:53.471 --> 12:55.207
Kidnapping.

12:55.873 --> 12:59.877
Dispatch come back with a
name of the possible victim.

12:59.910 --> 13:02.547
Lauren Daly.

13:05.216 --> 13:06.751
She's alive?

13:07.484 --> 13:08.519
Yes.

13:12.357 --> 13:13.357
Jim.

13:14.791 --> 13:15.827
Jim.

13:16.361 --> 13:19.364
-Lauren!
-Where is Lauren?

13:19.631 --> 13:20.665
Lauren!

13:20.699 --> 13:23.468
-Where's the car?
-I don't know! The cars gone!

13:23.501 --> 13:25.403
Where's the car? She's gone!

13:25.435 --> 13:27.171
Where's Lauren? What happened?

13:27.204 --> 13:29.373
I came back from the
beach, she's gone!

13:29.406 --> 13:30.374
Lauren!

13:30.407 --> 13:33.544
-Where is she?
-I don't know, I don't know!

13:33.578 --> 13:36.881
You see what happened?
What happened!?

13:36.915 --> 13:39.517
Where is she?

13:57.301 --> 13:58.469
Holy shit.

14:00.338 --> 14:02.341
She gonna wake up?

14:04.141 --> 14:06.817
We just recently gave
her some pain medication.

14:06.818 --> 14:09.381
She has a high fever
and other complications.

14:09.414 --> 14:11.817
Miss Alison Paige,
your social worker.

14:12.282 --> 14:13.417
Hi.

14:14.751 --> 14:15.920
Thank you, Connie.

14:15.953 --> 14:17.923
Could you give us
a few minutes please?

14:17.955 --> 14:19.624
-Sure.
-Thanks.

14:24.728 --> 14:27.431
Mrs. Daly.

14:29.000 --> 14:32.703
You look like you
could use some coffee.

14:35.740 --> 14:37.809
You watch her.

14:37.842 --> 14:51.456
She's gonna be ok.

14:51.488 --> 14:52.523
Hey.

14:54.858 --> 14:55.893
Cloud.

14:58.496 --> 14:59.530
Hey!

15:05.402 --> 15:07.705
-How ya been, Tom?
-What happened?

15:07.738 --> 15:09.974
You guys got enough
to worry about.

15:10.007 --> 15:11.942
Why don't ya leave the
police work to us.

15:11.976 --> 15:13.511
Why don't ya cut the shit?

15:13.544 --> 15:15.280
Who called it in?

15:19.817 --> 15:21.820
Call came in from the Hilltop.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.390
I guess she'd been sittin'
out there half the day...

15:25.423 --> 15:28.460
Nothing in tow but a book
and clothes on her back.

15:28.492 --> 15:29.994
Have you questioned her?

15:30.027 --> 15:33.030
She wouldn't
say anything, not a word.

15:33.064 --> 15:36.468
So they ran a missing person's
search for the past year.

15:36.501 --> 15:37.869
Nothing.

15:37.901 --> 15:39.771
I just knew it was her.

15:39.804 --> 15:42.807
-So no leads?
-Tom you know policy.

15:42.839 --> 15:45.509
Don't bullshit me Cloud...

15:45.543 --> 15:47.479
You owe me at least that.

15:47.511 --> 15:50.881
First off I don't
owe you shit!

15:50.915 --> 15:54.486
But considering
you're her uncle.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.821
There was a mechanic...

15:56.853 --> 15:59.790
he was workin' across the
street at Simmons Auto Body.

15:59.824 --> 16:02.626
He saw a white pickup with
Indiana plates leavin' around

16:02.660 --> 16:04.728
the time she was
seen sittin' there.

16:04.761 --> 16:06.631
That's it, no bullshit.

16:06.664 --> 16:08.366
Now this is my job.

16:08.399 --> 16:10.769
I will find that son-of-a-bitch
and I will bring him to justice!

16:10.801 --> 16:12.636
Yeah, I've heard this
before rookie.

16:12.670 --> 16:14.805
Detective.

16:15.673 --> 16:17.676
Be smart, Tommy.

16:29.686 --> 16:32.523
Lauren's been
gone a long time.

16:32.556 --> 16:35.693
Her home is where she lived
the majority of her life.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.595
She was kidnapped.

16:38.628 --> 16:40.031
Yes, she was.

16:41.433 --> 16:46.004
So imagine the psychological
impact from an experience like that.

16:48.705 --> 16:50.074
It takes time to heal.

16:50.107 --> 16:51.709
Heal what?

16:53.977 --> 16:56.814
The medical term is
Stockholm syndrome.

16:56.848 --> 16:59.351
It's where the victim...

16:59.383 --> 17:02.086
feels a connection or maybe
love towards their captor,

17:02.120 --> 17:04.622
no matter how traumatic
the experience was.

17:04.655 --> 17:06.589
She may feel the need to
protect him or her.

17:06.624 --> 17:08.593
I'm still her mother.

17:08.626 --> 17:10.627
Yes you are.

17:13.164 --> 17:16.468
The goal is to bring her home.

17:16.501 --> 17:18.770
So I'll be spending a few
hours a day with Lauren

17:18.801 --> 17:22.406
and your family to help you
through this process.

17:23.073 --> 17:25.675
You cannot smoke in
here, Mrs. Daly.

17:26.411 --> 17:29.014
Yeah... Right.

17:31.549 --> 17:32.751
Mrs. Daly.

17:34.618 --> 17:35.820
Mrs. Daly.

17:37.422 --> 17:39.024
Call me, Marie.

17:47.831 --> 17:50.601
Hey, bro, been looking
all over for ya.

17:50.635 --> 17:53.038
I got here as soon as I could.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.841
Is is it really her?

18:22.532 --> 18:24.535
It's me, momma.

18:26.236 --> 18:29.440
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

18:30.207 --> 18:32.176
Nurse, nurse,
nurse, nurse!

18:32.210 --> 18:36.514
-Hey, no she, no it's ok!
-Mom, mom, mom, mom.

18:36.547 --> 18:38.082
It's ok now!

18:49.493 --> 18:53.798
Remember when you and Lauren used
to walk over to my Grandmama's house?

18:53.830 --> 18:54.866
Yeah.

18:54.898 --> 18:57.202
Cause it was only place
where you guys could go

18:57.234 --> 19:00.070
an pig out on candy and
get sick from it?

19:00.104 --> 19:02.240
Yeah, I remember.

19:02.272 --> 19:05.476
Man my Grammy really
loved Lauren didn't she?

19:05.976 --> 19:07.711
More than us.

19:12.015 --> 19:14.018
Can I ask you something?

19:14.251 --> 19:16.454
Yeah, of course.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.056
Are you ready for this?

19:23.059 --> 19:24.863
Yeah, I'll be ok.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.732
Yeah, I'm scared too.

20:14.912 --> 20:17.516
Hi you're here!

20:18.049 --> 20:19.718
Welcome home!

20:20.318 --> 20:22.521
Well come on in.

20:26.223 --> 20:29.261
Come on in... Come on in.

20:40.838 --> 20:44.742
Noah! Your sister's here!

20:56.354 --> 20:58.590
This is really nice.

21:03.860 --> 21:06.196
-Hi, Marcus.
-Hey, Family!

21:06.230 --> 21:10.769
Lauren, good to see ya.
Long time no see.

21:11.234 --> 21:12.971
Maybe next time?

21:13.003 --> 21:14.606
It's all good.

21:22.413 --> 21:27.652
It's nice to have you
here Lauren... It really is.

22:28.311 --> 22:32.317
-Ya need any help?
-No I'm ok.

22:33.818 --> 22:35.854
Are you sure?

22:36.220 --> 22:38.088
Pretty sure.

22:40.825 --> 22:44.062
You wanna come hang
out with us in there?

22:48.933 --> 22:53.905
I've got a lot to do around
here. But yes, soon.

23:04.280 --> 23:10.254
Ok, well we're just right
in there, it's not far.

23:11.222 --> 23:12.857
Ok.

23:39.849 --> 23:41.785
Logan.

23:41.985 --> 23:44.287
-Hey, I'm outta here.
-See ya.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.291
-I'll be back at eight AM.
-K.

23:47.925 --> 23:49.293
Come on.

23:50.927 --> 23:52.930
You should talk to her.

24:02.205 --> 24:04.442
K... Goodnight.

24:07.011 --> 24:08.747
Goodnight.

26:43.032 --> 26:46.536
-Can I help you?
-Yeah you guys open?

26:46.569 --> 26:51.309
Well, yeah. Kind of
backed up right now.

26:51.341 --> 26:55.278
Yeah I just didn't know if
you guys work on...

26:55.311 --> 27:00.150
late nineties pickups or not.

27:00.184 --> 27:01.685
You a cop?

27:01.719 --> 27:03.421
Nah.

27:03.453 --> 27:06.223
Listen I'll just
come back later.

27:06.255 --> 27:08.291
Whoa whoa hey hey whoa!

27:08.325 --> 27:11.529
I'm due for a break,
I gotta take a squirt.

27:11.561 --> 27:14.365
Meet me in the
office over there.

27:15.198 --> 27:18.201
Keep leanin' on the
son of a bitch.

27:19.103 --> 27:22.106
So, how's the
Daly case going?

27:22.405 --> 27:23.707
Everything's great.

27:23.741 --> 27:26.711
Good, I was concerned
about this one.

27:26.743 --> 27:29.512
I wasn't sure how it was
gonna pan out frankly.

27:29.546 --> 27:34.285
One misstep, and this
could be a media circus.

27:34.651 --> 27:38.122
There aren't any clowns
wandering around here yet so far.

27:38.155 --> 27:41.291
-So you're doing a good job.
-Thank you.

27:41.657 --> 27:45.495
So, bring me up to
speed on the details.

27:45.529 --> 27:48.465
Well she's still
not speaking...

27:48.499 --> 27:51.068
Her diet seems
to be coming along.

27:51.100 --> 27:54.338
She mostly spends her time reading
Great Expectations to herself.

27:54.370 --> 27:57.407
I've seen her finish it
six or seven times now.

27:57.441 --> 27:58.608
Ok.

27:58.642 --> 28:02.113
I believe the book could be a
way to break through to her.

28:31.140 --> 28:34.344
You were sayin'
somethin' out there about...

28:34.377 --> 28:36.513
an early nineties pickup truck.

28:36.547 --> 28:38.549
What can I do for ya?

28:45.556 --> 28:50.161
I need you to tell me who was
driving that truck across the street.

28:50.426 --> 28:53.530
I see a lot of trucks
across the street.

28:53.563 --> 28:56.033
You know the one
I'm talking about.

28:57.334 --> 28:59.737
You said you weren't a cop?

29:01.704 --> 29:03.307
I'm not.

29:04.841 --> 29:08.045
Well, if ya ain't no cop...

29:08.511 --> 29:12.316

29:25.328 --> 29:28.499

29:30.867 --> 29:33.471
What's he look like?

29:52.422 --> 29:55.326

Absolutely.

29:59.896 --> 30:03.800
-So ya gonna order any food?
-Maybe.

30:05.168 --> 30:08.138
I'm just waiting on an
old friend of mine.

30:08.172 --> 30:11.642
A guy who comes in here
a lot. He...

30:11.675 --> 30:14.077
We lost touch and
I was just hoping

30:14.078 --> 30:16.880
maybe I could get
lucky and run into him.

30:16.914 --> 30:19.183
Maybe you will get lucky.

30:19.215 --> 30:22.819
Let me know if you need anything
alright? Anything at all.

30:22.853 --> 30:24.455

31:50.640 --> 31:54.511
So, Lauren seems to
be doing really well.

31:55.378 --> 31:58.281
She seems very content.

31:59.649 --> 32:00.917
Ya know...

32:01.885 --> 32:05.856
The people who usually do best
in these situations...

32:05.888 --> 32:08.959
Have a really strong
support system.

32:10.359 --> 32:13.697
She's lucky to have
a brother like you.

32:17.033 --> 32:21.871
So I'm taking her to see Great
Expectations tonight at seven.

Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, sir.

36:11.755 --> 36:14.104

36:14.136 --> 36:16.640

37:26.343 --> 37:30.548
Let's give it up for the cast
of Great Expectations!

38:03.013 --> 38:07.685
Did you see her Grab
my hand at the end there?

38:09.852 --> 38:12.622
Yeah... I did.

38:19.396 --> 38:22.265
Thank you.

38:26.301 --> 38:28.338
Goodnight.

38:51.928 --> 38:53.964
Sup slut.

38:59.202 --> 39:02.171
Did you eat my roast beef?

39:08.877 --> 39:12.883
-How ya doin' kid?
-Doin' alright how you doin'?

39:12.915 --> 39:15.385
I'm alright.

39:24.493 --> 39:27.468
Hey, I ever tell you
the story about when

39:27.469 --> 39:30.733
your dad used to drop
me off at junior high?

39:31.401 --> 39:35.906
He used to have this blue
custom sixty-nine van...

39:35.939 --> 39:42.345
with these, landscapes of big
titted women airbrushed on the side.

39:42.377 --> 39:45.247
Thing was bad ass.

39:45.281 --> 39:48.985
So the principal calls me up in
the office and she says:

39:49.017 --> 39:51.000
Your brother can't
drop you off at

39:51.001 --> 39:53.322
school anymore in
that van it's obscene.

39:53.356 --> 39:56.158
I was like why you talkin' to
me he's the one who drives it.

39:56.159 --> 39:57.093
Right.

39:57.127 --> 39:59.196
Sheriff rolls up
on him he's like:

39:59.229 --> 40:03.500
Jim you can't take your brother
to school anymore in that van,

40:03.533 --> 40:06.236
teachers are gettin' upset.

40:07.236 --> 40:11.273
Your old man, straight as an
arrow looks at him and says:

40:11.307 --> 40:14.144
Well I'll guess I'll see
you in the mornin'.

40:14.176 --> 40:18.080
What do

40:18.113 --> 40:20.507
He's like welp, that's
what the fuck I drive so

40:20.508 --> 40:22.852
if you want him to be
at school in the morning

40:22.885 --> 40:25.722
that's how he's gonna get there.

40:29.792 --> 40:33.930
Your old man was a funny
bastard I'll tell ya that.

40:43.439 --> 40:45.442
Ya know it's been...

40:46.575 --> 40:51.247
Good havin' Lauren back.

40:51.281 --> 40:54.284
Ya know and since
she's been back,

40:54.316 --> 40:58.021
It's opened my eyes to
a few things about...

40:59.155 --> 41:01.859

41:01.860 --> 41:04.928

41:04.961 --> 41:08.932

41:09.899 --> 41:11.902
And I promise you that.

41:12.234 --> 41:13.236
Cool.

41:17.973 --> 41:22.379
Alright kid welp, Ima hit the
hay. You get some rest.

42:09.492 --> 42:11.495
There he is.

43:36.178 --> 43:38.213
Lettin' her dance it off?

43:38.247 --> 43:41.251
Yeah yeah we'll give

43:42.385 --> 43:45.354
Hey, I saw you in
the paper and shit.

43:47.589 --> 43:49.593
Rick, whiskey!

43:52.327 --> 43:55.698
Hey, man that's cool that

43:55.731 --> 43:57.950
Damn shame what they did to her.

43:57.985 --> 44:00.169
The hell are you talkin' about?

44:00.202 --> 44:03.272
Bob, mind your own business.

44:03.740 --> 44:05.341
There's a lot of
weirdos out there.

44:05.342 --> 44:07.743
I watch them unsolved
mysteries and shit all the time.

44:07.776 --> 44:10.339
Pretty little girls.
Gettin' raped havin' babies

44:10.340 --> 44:12.048
for these nasty motherfuckers,

44:12.080 --> 44:15.385
locked in basements and shit.
Who knows that's all I'm sayin'.

44:15.417 --> 44:17.988
Why don't ya finish your drink
and get the hell out of here.

44:18.021 --> 44:21.191
What? I ain't sayin' nothin'
that ain't true or anybody else

44:21.223 --> 44:24.227

44:24.228 --> 44:25.729
I don't care! I don't care!

44:25.761 --> 44:26.964
Go!

44:27.363 --> 44:29.499
Well am I right or not?

44:30.165 --> 44:32.435
Well why don't we ask?

44:32.635 --> 44:35.310
You think your little
sister, was somewhere

44:35.311 --> 44:37.741
out there with that
dude lettin' him...

45:04.332 --> 45:07.136
Made ya something.

45:27.089 --> 45:31.727
Pip, what kind of name is Pip
anyways? You know any Pips?

45:33.562 --> 45:36.732
Mother by adoption,
retorted Estella,

45:36.765 --> 45:39.802
never departing from the
easy grace of her attitude,

45:39.836 --> 45:42.472
never raising her voice
as the others did,

45:42.504 --> 45:44.807
never yielding either to
anger or tenderness.

45:44.841 --> 45:48.545
Mother by adoption I have said
that I owe everything to you.

45:48.577 --> 45:51.561
All I posses is freely
yours, all that you

45:51.562 --> 45:54.684
have given me is your
command to have again;

45:54.716 --> 45:59.421
beyond that, I have nothing. And
if you ask me to give you what you

45:59.455 --> 46:03.460
never gave me my gratitude and
my duty cannot do impossibilities.

46:03.493 --> 46:08.532
Did I never give her love?
Cried Mrs. Hashim.

46:54.776 --> 46:56.780
Domino motherfucker.

47:08.790 --> 47:12.261
-You know you
-Whoa, no cheatin' man come on.

47:12.928 --> 47:14.263
Brewski?

47:14.463 --> 47:17.566
-Naw I'm good Marcus.
-You sure?

47:22.338 --> 47:25.408
Busted Bobby Miller's
head open pretty good.

47:25.707 --> 47:27.376
Yeah? How bad?

47:27.410 --> 47:32.848
Five stitches, a migraine and,
well a little loss of pride...

47:32.881 --> 47:35.784
I went down there and
talked to him myself...

47:35.818 --> 47:39.789
shed a little light on what you
Daly's have been going through.

47:42.691 --> 47:45.161
So why you really here, Cloud?

47:46.495 --> 47:49.566
I think it's time
I talk to Lauren.

48:05.448 --> 48:10.187
Hi Lauren, my name
is Jeffrey Cloud.

48:10.852 --> 48:14.223
I'm an old, old friend
of your family.

48:14.256 --> 48:17.961
You remind me so much of
my little sister, Anna...

48:17.993 --> 48:22.531
She was a spitting image of
you when she was younger.

48:23.999 --> 48:27.236
Anna and I were born
in Pennslyvania,

48:27.269 --> 48:29.898
But when we were
very, very young,

48:29.899 --> 48:33.842
we moved to Indiana to
live with our grandparents.

48:33.876 --> 48:38.436
Now our Grandparents lived
way out in the country,

48:38.437 --> 48:40.716
they had all sorts of land.

48:40.749 --> 48:45.222
One day, Anna and I were
running through the woods...

48:45.787 --> 48:49.892
We were having so much fun
that we lost track of time...

48:50.760 --> 48:53.662
and before we knew
it, we were lost.

48:56.031 --> 48:59.269
And I looked over at Anna,

49:00.068 --> 49:03.772
and I could see that
she was scared.

49:04.439 --> 49:10.280
But she grabbed my hand...
and together we walked.

49:11.714 --> 49:16.386
And it grew darker,
it grew colder...

49:16.651 --> 49:20.823
and all the noises in the
forest grow louder and louder...

49:21.790 --> 49:27.830
but we just kept walking and
eventually we made our way home.

49:29.064 --> 49:32.261
When we got inside
we were so cold that

49:32.262 --> 49:35.537
our Grandparents
wrapped us in blankets.

49:36.972 --> 49:39.408
And I looked over at her...

49:41.676 --> 49:47.950
and I was so proud.
She was such a brave girl.

49:54.122 --> 49:58.861
Now Lauren, I want you
to tell me a story...

50:01.129 --> 50:04.834
and I want you to take
your mom's hand...

50:06.102 --> 50:09.306
and I want ya to be
brave like Anna.

50:11.841 --> 50:14.644
Think ya can do that for me?

50:16.879 --> 50:20.583
I want you to think
really hard...

50:21.883 --> 50:26.588
and I want you to remember that
day, long, long time ago...

50:28.790 --> 50:31.861
The day you left the beach
without your family.

50:34.763 --> 50:38.334
There was a man who got
into the car that day.

50:38.734 --> 50:44.007
A man who was not your father,
and he was not your brother,

50:44.606 --> 50:46.742
and he drove off with you.

50:47.008 --> 50:49.912
Do you remember
who that man was?

50:54.649 --> 50:57.686
Do you remember where
you went that day?

51:02.925 --> 51:06.396
Lauren I need you to
keep being brave for me.

51:06.761 --> 51:08.765
I need you to help me.

51:10.533 --> 51:12.832
I need you to help me
protect other little

51:12.833 --> 51:15.505
girls that can be taken
away from their families.

51:15.905 --> 51:18.508
Girls like my Anna.

51:22.977 --> 51:26.816
It is very important for
me to find this man.

51:26.848 --> 51:29.084
What is his name?

51:34.856 --> 51:37.793
Lauren I know you
know how to speak.

51:38.227 --> 51:41.763
But do you understand
what happened to you?

51:41.796 --> 51:45.501
And I mean what really
happened to you.

51:45.533 --> 51:49.171
Do you want those type of things
to happen to other girls?

51:49.205 --> 51:51.007
Lauren I do not have the time

51:51.039 --> 51:52.341
-Tommy!
-nor the patience

51:52.374 --> 51:54.176
to sit around and wait
for you to be ready!

51:54.177 --> 51:55.077
That's enough!

51:55.109 --> 51:56.745
I need to know now!

51:56.778 --> 52:00.182
And I need to know who he
is and where he's from!

52:00.216 --> 52:03.185
Lauren you know
who this man is!

52:03.218 --> 52:05.220
You know who this man is!

52:05.254 --> 52:07.824
He took you away
from your family!

52:07.856 --> 52:09.858
Away from those that love you!

52:09.892 --> 52:11.794
He took away your childhood!

52:11.827 --> 52:14.229
He took away your
goddamn innocence!

52:14.263 --> 52:16.199
Now why are you
protecting this man?

52:16.231 --> 52:18.100
When he did not protect you?

52:30.778 --> 52:33.115
To protect myself.

52:36.618 --> 52:37.586
Lauren!

52:38.053 --> 52:38.988
Lauren!

53:13.289 --> 53:17.660
Lauren! Lauren stop! Lauren!

53:23.265 --> 53:25.268
-Lauren look at me.
-No!

53:25.301 --> 53:27.603
Look at me Lauren, look at me.

53:27.635 --> 53:29.638
Lauren! Look at me!

54:26.260 --> 54:30.232
So, what can I getcha ya guy?

54:31.133 --> 54:35.571
I was wondering if Samantha
was working today?

54:36.238 --> 54:38.073
You mean Sara?

54:38.106 --> 54:39.107
Yeah.

54:40.109 --> 54:42.812
Hell she's on break.

54:42.845 --> 54:47.149
She may be in the ladies
room now though.

54:47.182 --> 54:49.084
Hey!

54:49.118 --> 54:50.886
You ain't allowed
to be goin' in there!

54:50.919 --> 54:52.655
I know that!

54:52.687 --> 54:54.356
That's fuckin' weird.

55:11.406 --> 55:14.042
-Hi.
-Hi.

55:15.343 --> 55:16.612

55:18.013 --> 55:19.616

55:21.050 --> 55:23.318
-You're being weird.
-Yeah?

55:23.352 --> 55:24.654
Yeah.

55:33.294 --> 55:36.665
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

55:37.332 --> 55:39.935
My God, that was unprofessional.

56:18.473 --> 56:21.678
You're turning into
quite the customer

56:22.845 --> 56:24.247
Shit.

56:26.814 --> 56:29.184
You remember when I was
here the other day?

56:29.218 --> 56:32.754
Yeah you never said goodbye.

56:33.354 --> 56:35.390
I thought I saw my friend.

56:36.492 --> 56:38.636
He looked different
so I didn't wanna

56:38.637 --> 56:41.062
weird him out or
anything bum rushin' him.

56:41.095 --> 56:43.398
Yeah, what he look like?

56:43.432 --> 56:48.104
Ya know big brown sunglasses
about fifty, kinda skinny.

56:49.271 --> 56:53.142
-Drives a white truck.
-Yeah, right yeah.

56:53.175 --> 56:55.077
You know him?

56:55.109 --> 56:58.347
I think his name's Dave
or Dale or something,

56:58.379 --> 57:03.151
he's a trucker so he comes in
and out, I don't always see him.

57:03.185 --> 57:04.754
You know anything about him?

57:04.787 --> 57:06.388
I know he's a creeper.

57:07.856 --> 57:09.992
What do you mean creeper?

57:10.024 --> 57:12.360
Ya know comes in
stares at girls.

57:12.394 --> 57:15.397
I mean any guy who comes out of
the highways gonna be a creeper.

57:16.430 --> 57:19.167
Hell you're probably
a creeper too.

57:20.803 --> 57:23.272
Never likes any girls
his own age though...

57:23.305 --> 57:27.743
he does stare at my ass,
can't complain about that.

57:29.278 --> 57:31.280
Sure ya can.

57:42.423 --> 57:44.426
Thanks a lot, Samantha.

57:44.959 --> 57:46.528
It's Sara!

57:46.562 --> 57:48.030
Asshole.

58:22.865 --> 58:24.332
Hey.

58:24.365 --> 58:25.834
Hey, hi.

58:25.868 --> 58:27.303
Hey, I know you!

58:27.336 --> 58:30.171
You're the girl from
the paper right?

58:30.205 --> 58:31.841
Let's go Laur, come on.

58:31.874 --> 58:36.178
Well ya know hey I didn't
mean anything by it.

59:06.374 --> 59:07.976
Goddamn.

59:13.381 --> 59:16.084
I've let you have extra time.

59:16.118 --> 59:18.526
I understand it's
difficult to not get

59:18.527 --> 59:21.490
attached to people you
spend so much time with.

59:21.522 --> 59:23.124
I've been there.

59:23.591 --> 59:28.030
By trying to protect them, you
cause more harm in the long run.

59:30.665 --> 59:34.035
I need to know now, Alison...

59:34.068 --> 59:37.072
Is the mother still drinking?

01:00:00.696 --> 01:00:02.197
Hey.

01:00:02.229 --> 01:00:04.032
What's going on boys?

01:00:04.066 --> 01:00:05.600
Hey, guys check it out.

01:00:05.633 --> 01:00:08.169
It's a mini fridge.

01:00:11.539 --> 01:00:14.075
When I was your age I used to
have one of these in my room,

01:00:14.109 --> 01:00:16.444
and I thought it
was pretty cool.

01:00:16.477 --> 01:00:19.548
Of course then again mine
was full of beer.

01:00:20.381 --> 01:00:22.952
Or healthy things like...

01:00:22.984 --> 01:00:24.986
banana juice.

01:00:40.102 --> 01:00:41.504
You like it?

01:00:52.481 --> 01:00:54.082
You're welcome.

01:00:56.618 --> 01:00:58.955
Do you have any fours?

01:01:00.354 --> 01:01:03.358
No? Go fish.

01:01:05.794 --> 01:01:07.029
Ok.

01:01:14.769 --> 01:01:16.137
Your turn.

01:01:23.511 --> 01:01:25.481
You get that for me?

01:01:25.513 --> 01:01:28.483
No, it's probably Marcus.

01:01:28.517 --> 01:01:30.118
Go get the door.

01:01:31.385 --> 01:01:33.354
-Noah!
-Ok!

01:01:33.388 --> 01:01:36.125
Don't look seriously,
actually I'm taking these.

01:01:36.158 --> 01:01:37.259
Yeah? Ok.

01:01:41.263 --> 01:01:43.432
Would you be Noah Daly?

01:01:43.464 --> 01:01:44.399
That's right.

01:01:44.432 --> 01:01:45.533
I'm Virgil Weaver.

01:01:45.568 --> 01:01:48.370
This is Brenda Miller from
Child Protective Services

01:01:48.403 --> 01:01:50.272
and Officer Kern.

01:01:50.305 --> 01:01:52.140
You mind if we come in?

01:01:52.173 --> 01:01:54.442
Is there anything I can
help you with?

01:01:54.475 --> 01:01:58.446
We have a warrant for the premise to
check on the welfare of a Lauren Daly.

01:02:06.421 --> 01:02:08.457
Hi, Lauren.

01:02:10.225 --> 01:02:11.985
My name is Brenda, we're
just here on a routine

01:02:11.986 --> 01:02:13.562
check to make sure
your comfortable honey.

01:02:13.595 --> 01:02:16.031
Can you show me
your room please?

01:02:17.598 --> 01:02:19.167
Go ahead Laur.

01:02:34.582 --> 01:02:37.653
I thought you guys gave
notification or something.

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:41.824
There were some red flags on the report
on Lauren which we have to check out.

01:02:41.856 --> 01:02:43.358
It's policy.

01:02:43.591 --> 01:02:46.194
-Where's Mrs. Daly?
-She's at work.

01:02:46.227 --> 01:02:47.528
When do you expect her back?

01:02:47.562 --> 01:02:49.631
She's been working
overtime a lot and...

01:02:49.664 --> 01:02:53.468
Hey, Noah you didn't tell me
we had folks visiting.

01:02:53.502 --> 01:02:55.571
Can I get ya'll
somethin' to drink?

01:02:55.604 --> 01:02:57.606
No, thanks, Mrs. Daly.

01:02:57.638 --> 01:03:00.575
I'm Virgil Weaver with
Child Protective Services.

01:03:00.609 --> 01:03:01.744
Hi.

01:03:01.776 --> 01:03:05.113
-How much have you had to drink today?
-Nothin'.

01:03:05.147 --> 01:03:06.515
Well then if it's
ok with you

01:03:06.548 --> 01:03:09.851
I'm gonna ask Officer Kern to check
your room for signs of alcohol.

01:03:09.885 --> 01:03:13.488
If we don't have any problems we'll
be out of your hair in no time.

01:03:16.357 --> 01:03:19.986
I love the yellow walls
Lauren and your own fridge?

01:03:19.987 --> 01:03:21.196
Lucky girl.

01:03:21.229 --> 01:03:23.566
You trust me right?

01:03:25.499 --> 01:03:28.870
Do you know what, these are just so
old and they're goin' in the garbage.

01:03:28.903 --> 01:03:31.573
Unfortunately that's
not how it works.

01:03:31.906 --> 01:03:36.144
Mrs. Daly, as custodian of
this minor child Lauren Daly,

01:03:36.178 --> 01:03:39.214
you're not maintaining a proper
household according to standards

01:03:39.247 --> 01:03:41.884
we're gonna have to remove her
from the home for the time being.

01:03:41.917 --> 01:03:43.752
First she'll go to
a hospital then she's

01:03:43.753 --> 01:03:45.587
gonna end up in a
temporary foster home.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:47.522
You can reach her rep there.

01:03:47.555 --> 01:03:51.260
-I won't let them take you.
-Come on, Laur... Officer!

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:53.495
They can't take you.

01:03:53.528 --> 01:03:58.200
Please don't, please no no no
please please don't take her!

01:04:00.267 --> 01:04:02.537
You trust me right?
You trust me?

01:04:02.571 --> 01:04:04.540
Ok, I'm sorry.

01:04:12.948 --> 01:04:15.651
You get outta here!

01:04:16.551 --> 01:04:17.819
Noah!

01:04:18.252 --> 01:04:18.921
Go.

01:04:18.953 --> 01:04:20.923
Please let me explain, Noah...

01:04:20.955 --> 01:04:22.925
No you need to go!

01:04:22.957 --> 01:04:25.660
-Go, go!
-Let me explain!

01:04:25.961 --> 01:04:28.363
And what are you doing, Ma?

01:04:28.396 --> 01:04:30.698
-What am I doing?
-What are you doing?

01:04:30.731 --> 01:04:34.502
You have this little girl who can
never seem to find her way home.

01:04:34.535 --> 01:04:39.874
Ok, the first time that was a tragedy
but this time it's your fuckin' fault!

01:06:06.528 --> 01:06:08.731
Hey, hey new girl.

01:06:10.464 --> 01:06:13.468
Why are you sleeping
on the floor?

01:06:18.872 --> 01:06:20.708
I'm Julie.

01:06:23.745 --> 01:06:25.580
Why you here?

01:06:29.917 --> 01:06:31.753
You're funny.

01:06:33.455 --> 01:06:37.059
I been living with Peggy
for a year now, I like it.

01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:39.294
Goodnight new girl.

01:07:27.609 --> 01:07:30.511
-Hey, baby.
-Hey, mom.

01:07:34.883 --> 01:07:36.417
I...

01:07:37.151 --> 01:07:40.454
put a pot of chili on...

01:07:40.488 --> 01:07:43.492
well it came from the can but.

01:07:57.638 --> 01:08:00.376
You got one of those for me?

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:09.417
You know how to smoke?

01:08:18.193 --> 01:08:20.028
These things...

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:22.064
they taste like shit.

01:08:23.198 --> 01:08:25.801
Dad didn't like em' much.

01:08:32.238 --> 01:08:35.077
He would have been proud of you.

01:08:38.212 --> 01:08:39.447
Maybe.

01:08:39.979 --> 01:08:43.850
No really, no maybe about it.

01:08:45.252 --> 01:08:48.723
He would have been ashamed
of me, but proud of you.

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:51.693
Everyone has choices, mom...

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.131
And he made his.

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:02.569
Man's got his own reasons.

01:09:07.242 --> 01:09:10.111
You know I love you mom, right?

01:09:16.984 --> 01:09:19.121
I sure do, son.

01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:23.591
You know I love you too, right?

01:09:23.624 --> 01:09:25.859
-Yeah.
-Good.

01:09:34.868 --> 01:09:39.274
I think you just come in here
all the time just to see me.

01:09:39.305 --> 01:09:41.510
You know it sugar.

01:09:56.891 --> 01:09:59.794
Jackie you're the
best. Thank you!

01:09:59.827 --> 01:10:02.830
You're welcome.
See you next wednesday.

01:11:56.276 --> 01:11:57.378
Hi.

01:11:57.412 --> 01:11:58.847
Can I help you?

01:11:58.879 --> 01:12:00.882
Yeah I'm here to see...

01:12:00.914 --> 01:12:03.651
You're Noah, Lauren's
older brother.

01:12:03.685 --> 01:12:05.153
Yes ma'am.

01:12:05.419 --> 01:12:07.788
You're not supposed to be here.

01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:09.758
I know.

01:12:12.060 --> 01:12:14.396
You look like your mom.

01:12:14.428 --> 01:12:17.132
I knew her in
school, pretty girl.

01:12:17.164 --> 01:12:20.702
We didn't hang out much but
we had some mutual friends.

01:12:21.002 --> 01:12:23.772
I hear the bottles gettin'
the best of her though.

01:12:23.805 --> 01:12:27.676
Yeah she's in she's in
a six month now so.

01:12:28.176 --> 01:12:29.211
Good.

01:12:29.976 --> 01:12:31.379
God bless her.

01:12:32.113 --> 01:12:34.115
It's tough to kick.

01:12:34.449 --> 01:12:36.652
I did it myself.

01:12:37.918 --> 01:12:39.921
Well I'll tell her
you said hello.

01:12:39.954 --> 01:12:41.690
You do that.

01:12:42.457 --> 01:12:45.227
I can't let ya in the house.

01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:47.663
But...

01:12:48.829 --> 01:12:52.300
If ya have a seat over there,
I'll bring her out to ya.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:53.802
Thank you.

01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:09.150
Hey.

01:13:11.886 --> 01:13:13.355
How are you?

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:22.963
Peggy seems nice,
she's a nice lady.

01:13:30.837 --> 01:13:32.840
I'm workin' on some stuff.

01:13:33.141 --> 01:13:35.343
Mom, she's gettin' help.

01:13:36.778 --> 01:13:39.847
You're just gonna have to
give me a little time but...

01:13:42.115 --> 01:13:44.118
I'll bring ya home.

01:13:51.525 --> 01:13:55.129
I brought some of your
stuff from the house, just.

01:13:58.431 --> 01:13:59.934
I...

01:14:05.539 --> 01:14:08.209
And I found this it's...

01:14:11.279 --> 01:14:13.949
It's really important to me.

01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:21.056
I wanted you to have it though.

01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:29.163

01:14:57.391 --> 01:14:58.393

Hey, heard anymore

Smile for the camera?

01:16:01.154 --> 01:16:05.659
Lauren sweetie, I think you're the
most beautiful lady in the kingdom.

01:16:05.693 --> 01:16:07.628
I think you should be queen.

01:16:07.662 --> 01:16:09.865
Thanks, dad.

01:16:10.431 --> 01:16:13.435
Say goodbye, guys!

Hey.

01:16:34.422 --> 01:16:36.024
Can I come in?

01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:39.560
Sure.

01:16:42.696 --> 01:16:44.900
Look, Noah...

01:16:46.167 --> 01:16:49.337
-I'm really sorry about...
-I am too.

01:16:53.507 --> 01:16:56.111
There's something that
I need to show you.

01:17:23.003 --> 01:17:24.004
Fuck!

01:17:39.253 --> 01:17:41.156
It's her diary.

01:18:10.784 --> 01:18:12.386
Fucking Tommy.

01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.196
Alison look at this.

01:19:01.502 --> 01:19:03.805
Today I was hungry,

01:19:03.837 --> 01:19:07.675
I stole food just like
Pip has to in the story.

01:19:07.708 --> 01:19:10.812
I am starting to read with
better speed and understanding.

01:19:10.845 --> 01:19:14.214
I have read every book
in my dad's house.

01:19:14.248 --> 01:19:16.684
He has a lot and brings
many more home for me,

01:19:16.717 --> 01:19:19.253
it is his way of
raising me by hand.

01:19:19.285 --> 01:19:23.690
I plead with him to travel, but he
told me that I'm not allowed to do so.

01:19:23.723 --> 01:19:26.343
Last time I spoke to
him about it he got upset

01:19:26.344 --> 01:19:28.796
and struck me with
great force in the face.

01:19:28.829 --> 01:19:32.300
I bled a lot, I always see
blood when he is unhappy.

01:19:32.333 --> 01:19:35.103
That's how I know when
he doesn't favor me.

01:19:35.136 --> 01:19:36.504
But that's ok.

01:19:36.537 --> 01:19:39.307
For Pip doesn't have parents
at least I have one.

01:19:39.339 --> 01:19:42.642
I do fear him though, as
sometimes he displays love,

01:19:42.676 --> 01:19:46.847
other times he displays hate.
So I admit I get confused.

01:19:46.881 --> 01:19:49.350
One day I shall run
outside like Pip,

01:19:49.382 --> 01:19:52.787
far far away, maybe
even to London.

01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:59.494
Hold on, hold this,
I'll be right back.

01:20:07.267 --> 01:20:08.301
Where's Tommy?

01:20:08.334 --> 01:20:09.470
Tommy!

01:20:09.503 --> 01:20:10.738
What you doing, Cloud?

01:20:10.770 --> 01:20:11.872
Where's the gun?

01:20:11.905 --> 01:20:14.341
Where's he keep the fucking gun?

01:20:14.374 --> 01:20:15.575
It's not here.

01:20:15.609 --> 01:20:17.712
I think he found
Lauren's kidnapper.

01:20:17.744 --> 01:20:19.113
What?

01:20:19.512 --> 01:20:21.748
He's about to
do something stupid!

01:20:28.922 --> 01:20:34.895
Today I was not in favor of my father,
as I feel pain on my body and my heart.

01:20:34.928 --> 01:20:38.498
He hovered above me, his
shadow blocking my light and

01:20:38.531 --> 01:20:42.302
forced himself on me as one
would do with their wife.

01:20:50.945 --> 01:20:54.259
S.O. need units to respond
to 447 County Road 3

01:20:54.260 --> 01:20:55.917
in reference to an armed subject

01:20:55.949 --> 01:20:58.269
possibly in route to
that address, be advised

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.287
the subject is a
former police officer.

01:21:13.967 --> 01:21:18.572
Over and over and
over and over I screamed...

01:21:18.972 --> 01:21:20.941
Please stop...

01:21:20.975 --> 01:21:23.945
I tried to scream but my
voice made no sound...

01:21:23.977 --> 01:21:28.182
Over and over and
over and over again.

01:21:28.982 --> 01:21:32.285
The only end of this life
seems death I thought.

01:21:32.319 --> 01:21:35.356
Such a horrible
thought to think of.

01:21:35.388 --> 01:21:38.592
Please go far, far from here
at this time father,

01:21:38.626 --> 01:21:41.294
and never return to this land.

01:21:41.328 --> 01:21:43.263
What the hell?

01:21:46.367 --> 01:21:48.703
You're a hard man to find.

01:22:01.481 --> 01:22:03.484
Who are you?

01:22:25.638 --> 01:22:26.641
Fucker!

01:22:33.713 --> 01:22:35.682
Cloud?

01:22:39.052 --> 01:22:43.390
Drop the weapon!
I wanna see your hands!

01:22:51.731 --> 01:22:53.767
Drop the hammer, put it down!

01:22:56.837 --> 01:22:58.806
I wanna see your hands!

01:22:58.838 --> 01:22:59.707
Drop it!

01:22:59.739 --> 01:23:02.276
Hold your fire!

01:23:08.949 --> 01:23:11.919
It doesn't have to
end like this, Tommy!

01:23:13.553 --> 01:23:15.690
Let's be smart here.

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:20.295
Put the hammer down.

01:23:21.762 --> 01:23:23.765
Look at me Tom.

01:23:27.133 --> 01:23:29.369
Drop the hammer.

01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:35.343
Come on Tom.

01:23:37.578 --> 01:23:39.580
Let me take you in.

01:23:43.717 --> 01:23:45.887
Ima put my gun away.

01:23:51.458 --> 01:23:53.561
Tom, it's ok man.

01:23:59.466 --> 01:24:00.868
Let's go.

01:24:01.935 --> 01:24:02.870
Gun!

01:24:08.007 --> 01:24:13.347
Dispatch this is unit 37, shots
fired, need an ambulance at the scene.

01:24:17.551 --> 01:24:19.120
Clear!

01:25:35.095 --> 01:25:38.833
It's been like a dream
having you back Lauren...

01:25:39.132 --> 01:25:42.904
Just one of those you
don't wanna wake up from.

01:25:43.270 --> 01:25:46.973
With you we were
a family and...

01:25:47.007 --> 01:25:50.011
after, we just crumbled.

01:25:50.878 --> 01:25:55.683
I cannot imagine what it was like for
you all those years with that monster.

01:25:55.716 --> 01:25:59.820
Your light held this family
together and when he took you,

01:25:59.852 --> 01:26:02.856
well I just think he took
a piece from all of us.

01:26:05.124 --> 01:26:07.962
But I have learned that
who we are in this life,

01:26:07.994 --> 01:26:10.730
it doesn't matter about the
tragedies we go through,

01:26:10.763 --> 01:26:14.468
but it is how we respond
that makes our souls.

01:26:15.769 --> 01:26:19.239
I'm sick Lauren, it's
just the way things are.

01:26:19.272 --> 01:26:23.843
I don't have much time and I
don't want you to cry for me but,

01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:28.649
I want you to know that, seein'
you, knowing that you're here safe...

01:26:28.681 --> 01:26:32.019
It's all that I ever
wanted in this life.

01:26:34.754 --> 01:26:37.757
And just know that
I'll always be there.

01:26:40.159 --> 01:26:42.896
Long live the queen.

01:27:19.932 --> 01:27:25.539
If you think I should wait till
next fall to go to Oxford I can.

01:27:25.939 --> 01:27:29.110
That's what he
left you the money for.

01:27:29.876 --> 01:27:32.146
I know but...

01:27:32.178 --> 01:27:35.315
I don't want to leave
you here and everybody.

01:27:35.348 --> 01:27:38.852
Do what you wanna do,
it's your choice.

01:27:50.396 --> 01:27:53.333
I wonder what he
would say right now.

01:27:56.035 --> 01:27:58.038
I don't know.

01:27:59.373 --> 01:28:01.842
I just miss him I guess.

01:28:04.177 --> 01:28:05.680
Me too.

01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:09.149
Me too.

01:28:14.387 --> 01:28:16.723
Yeah we're good.

01:28:16.757 --> 01:28:19.327
So you gonna come
visit us soon?

01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:20.860
Ok.

01:28:20.894 --> 01:28:22.663
Alright I love you too.

01:28:22.695 --> 01:28:23.963
Bye.

01:28:23.997 --> 01:28:25.165
Hey, Noah?

01:28:27.199 --> 01:28:28.368
Noah?

01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:32.672
Hey, bud!

01:28:32.705 --> 01:28:35.409
Mama's been calling for you.

01:28:35.441 --> 01:28:37.977
You wanna go get
washed up for dinner?

01:28:38.011 --> 01:28:40.114
Let's go, come on.

01:30:33.694 --> 01:30:35.996
Hi, Perry.

01:30:36.797 --> 01:30:38.265
You remember this?

01:30:38.297 --> 01:30:40.032
I don't know what that is.

01:30:40.065 --> 01:30:41.801
You don't?
Great Expectations?

01:30:41.834 --> 01:30:44.037
Who the hell do
you think you are?

01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:47.107
-Sir place your hands behind your back.
-Leave me alone!

01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:49.042
Leave me alone!

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:52.846
In a court of law, you have
the right to a attorney...

01:30:52.878 --> 01:30:56.182
Have you questioned her?
Who is she?

01:30:57.305 --> 01:31:03.172
