00:01.742 --> 00:03.327
Engineering has a rich

00:03.327 --> 00:04.661
and storied history,

00:04.661 --> 00:07.289
dating back to ancient times.

00:07.989 --> 00:11.323
Some consider it the single most
important field of study...

00:11.348 --> 00:12.850
Okay, w-wha... no. Stop.

00:12.850 --> 00:15.060
I'm sorry.
Howard, I can't do this.

00:15.060 --> 00:17.187
You asked me to write you
an introduction to engineering.

00:17.187 --> 00:18.522
Yes, and if I wanted
a comedy routine,

00:18.522 --> 00:20.357
I'd have gone to Billy Crystal.

00:20.357 --> 00:22.359
Just let me read it.

00:23.271 --> 00:25.779
Engineering has a rich
and storied history

00:25.779 --> 00:28.866
dating back to ancient times.

00:28.866 --> 00:30.868
Some consider it the single
most important field of study

00:30.868 --> 00:32.454
known to man,

00:32.479 --> 00:35.289
from the wheel to the
International Space Station,

00:35.289 --> 00:36.832
which I went to.

00:36.832 --> 00:38.876
Honestly, this again?

00:38.876 --> 00:40.206
Like we don't hear
about your Nobel Prize

00:40.231 --> 00:42.004
all the time.

00:42.004 --> 00:44.173
It's not my fault
people ask about it.

00:44.173 --> 00:45.883
Because you're always
wearing it!

00:45.883 --> 00:47.926
You have it on right now.

00:47.926 --> 00:49.845
Look how shiny it is.

00:49.845 --> 00:51.430
Just tell your story.

00:51.430 --> 00:53.974
My own history with engineering

00:53.974 --> 00:57.353
began spring semester
of my freshman year.

00:57.353 --> 00:58.520
Good morning.

00:58.520 --> 01:00.898
I'm Professor Boucher,

01:00.898 --> 01:03.275
and this
is Civil Engineering Lab.

01:03.275 --> 01:06.695
Class begins at 0900,
which is...

01:07.655 --> 01:09.615
...now.

01:10.574 --> 01:12.242
In this course,

01:12.242 --> 01:13.619
we're going to apply
the principles

01:13.619 --> 01:15.120
of static mechanical forces...

01:16.413 --> 01:18.290
I'm in this class.

01:18.290 --> 01:20.417
This class started at 0900,

01:20.417 --> 01:24.338
so... no, you're not.

01:25.589 --> 01:26.924
As I was saying,

01:26.924 --> 01:28.592
Uh, yes?

01:28.592 --> 01:31.595
I appreciate your use
of the 24-four hour time format.

01:31.595 --> 01:34.098
Were you aware that while often
referred to as "military time,"

01:34.098 --> 01:36.183
it actually dates back
to the Egyptians?

01:36.183 --> 01:40.020
I'm aware that the class
is now starting at 0901.

01:40.020 --> 01:42.439
Is it all right with you
if I begin?

01:42.439 --> 01:44.084
Please.

01:44.162 --> 01:47.499
One minute in
and I was already his favorite.

01:47.499 --> 01:50.418
♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪

01:50.418 --> 01:53.088
♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪

01:53.088 --> 01:55.507
♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪

01:55.507 --> 01:57.467
♪ I am a mighty little man ♪

01:57.467 --> 02:02.472
♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪

02:05.855 --> 02:08.858
This course is about
practical applications.

02:08.858 --> 02:12.069
This isn't about fancy theories
or what works in a classroom.

02:12.069 --> 02:15.197
If a tunnel collapses, the
only math that's gonna matter

02:15.197 --> 02:16.907
is the body count.

02:19.035 --> 02:20.953
You.
Sheldon Cooper.

02:20.953 --> 02:23.247
Son, I'll learn your name
if you make it to midterms.

02:23.247 --> 02:24.874
Right now,
you're just a number to me.

02:24.874 --> 02:26.584
Ooh, can I be number one?

02:26.584 --> 02:28.461
That's what Captain Picard
calls Commander Riker

02:28.461 --> 02:30.463
Next Generation.

02:30.463 --> 02:34.258
You need to listen more
and talk less.

02:34.258 --> 02:36.761
Is that clear, number one?

02:37.762 --> 02:39.263
Aye, Captain.

02:39.263 --> 02:40.598
Hmm.

02:44.435 --> 02:45.436
Ballard's.

02:45.436 --> 02:46.729
Hello.

02:46.729 --> 02:48.564
Hey, what's up?
Oh, nothing.

02:48.564 --> 02:51.400
I just called to say hello.
Oh.

02:51.400 --> 02:54.070
Gee, I don't think I've done
that in my entire life.

02:54.070 --> 02:55.571
You want me to hang up?

02:55.571 --> 02:57.990
No. Uh-uh.

02:57.990 --> 03:00.159
W... But what happens next?

03:00.159 --> 03:01.160
Oh, wait, hang on.

03:01.160 --> 03:02.578
I got another call.

03:02.578 --> 03:04.580
All right, fine,
yeah, sure, I can w...

03:04.580 --> 03:05.915
Hello?

03:05.915 --> 03:07.500
Hey, Connie. June.

03:07.500 --> 03:09.293
Hi, June. What's going on?

03:09.293 --> 03:11.253
I know you have a hair
appointment this afternoon,

03:11.253 --> 03:12.672
but I'm gonna have to cancel.

03:12.672 --> 03:14.131
Everything okay?

03:14.131 --> 03:16.759
No, I busted my knee up
pretty good.

03:16.759 --> 03:18.761
Oh. Does Dale know?

03:18.761 --> 03:21.097
I-I'm on the other line
with him.

03:21.097 --> 03:23.307
No, not yet.
Yeah, you can tell him.

03:23.307 --> 03:24.517
Okay, hang on.

03:24.517 --> 03:25.726
Hello?

03:25.726 --> 03:27.395
I'm so sorry, who's this?

03:27.395 --> 03:28.521
It's been so long.

03:28.521 --> 03:30.564
I'm on the phone with June.

03:30.564 --> 03:31.941
She hurt her knee.

03:31.941 --> 03:33.025
How?

03:33.025 --> 03:34.360
Well, hold on.

03:35.486 --> 03:36.821
How'd you hurt it?

03:36.821 --> 03:38.447
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

03:38.447 --> 03:41.450
I slipped on a glob
of hair gel at the salon.

03:41.450 --> 03:43.285
Wait a minute.

03:43.285 --> 03:46.789
She slipped on a glob
of hair gel at the salon.

03:46.789 --> 03:49.125
Oh, nice.

03:49.125 --> 03:50.960
Well, that was worth the wait.

03:52.336 --> 03:54.714
And then, at exactly 9:00,

03:54.714 --> 03:57.133
he locked the doors and wouldn't
let any latecomers in.

03:57.133 --> 03:58.718
That seems a little harsh.

03:58.718 --> 04:00.553
He's so intolerant.
It's fantastic.

04:00.553 --> 04:03.180
He also wears a bow tie, and
instead of using my name,

04:03.180 --> 04:04.849
he gave me a number.

04:04.849 --> 04:06.475
I don't think
I like that, either.

04:06.475 --> 04:07.893
No, it's great.
It's like we're robots.

04:07.893 --> 04:09.395
And guess what my number is.

04:09.395 --> 04:10.813
Number two?

04:10.813 --> 04:11.897
No, number one,

04:11.897 --> 04:13.441
like Riker on Star Trek.

04:13.441 --> 04:15.901
But number two is also good.
Like the pencil.

04:15.901 --> 04:17.236
Well,

04:17.236 --> 04:18.863
I'm glad you enjoyed your class.

04:18.863 --> 04:20.948
For our first assignment,
we get to build a bridge.

04:20.948 --> 04:23.576
Professor Boucher was part
of the Army Corps of Engineers,

04:23.576 --> 04:25.661
and he built bridges
all over the world.

04:25.661 --> 04:27.496
You know,
I was also in the Army.

04:27.496 --> 04:29.832
Ooh, perhaps you trudged
across one of his bridges.

04:29.832 --> 04:31.167
How neat would that be?

04:31.167 --> 04:33.210
I bet Dad did cool
Army stuff, too.

04:33.210 --> 04:35.713
Nope. "Trudging" sums it up.

04:35.713 --> 04:37.715
See, number one
is also pretty funny,

04:37.715 --> 04:39.258
'cause it means taking a leak.

04:42.595 --> 04:44.096
Come in.

04:44.096 --> 04:46.515
If you're a robber,
I got a shotgun.

04:46.515 --> 04:48.267
It's Connie and Dale.
Don't shoot.

04:48.267 --> 04:49.518
Oh.

04:49.518 --> 04:51.729
Hey. Y'all didn't
have to come by.

04:51.729 --> 04:52.855
We just wanted to see

04:52.855 --> 04:54.356
how you're doing.

04:54.356 --> 04:56.442
Yeah. Brought your
favorite ice cream.

04:56.442 --> 04:57.610
Butter pecan?

04:58.652 --> 05:00.237
What's your second-favorite?

05:01.280 --> 05:03.866
I'll put this away.

05:03.866 --> 05:05.367
So, how's it going?

05:05.367 --> 05:06.744
Do you have anybody
to help you out?

05:06.744 --> 05:10.372
Oh, yeah. These little guys.

05:10.372 --> 05:12.082
Elvis was onto something.

05:12.082 --> 05:14.293
Till he keeled
over on the toilet.

05:14.293 --> 05:15.878
He was the king.

05:15.878 --> 05:18.380
That was his throne.

05:18.380 --> 05:21.467
Seriously, now, though,
if you need anything at all,

05:21.467 --> 05:22.968
we are here for you.

05:22.968 --> 05:25.387
That's right. 100%.

05:26.388 --> 05:27.515
Would you stop?

05:27.515 --> 05:29.099
I was being sincere.

05:29.099 --> 05:31.894
Well, that's for the next
dumb thing you say.

05:31.894 --> 05:33.229
Well, just quit
hitting me, would you?

05:33.229 --> 05:34.480
Well, quit being stupid.

05:36.482 --> 05:38.776
For your design assignment,
you may decide

05:38.776 --> 05:41.278
between suspension bridges,
truss bridges, beam bridges,

05:41.278 --> 05:43.864
just not Beau Bridges.

05:46.283 --> 05:50.246
And people say engineers
don't have a sense of humor.

05:50.246 --> 05:51.247
Yes?

05:51.247 --> 05:52.790
What are Beau Bridges?

05:54.083 --> 05:55.584
That's all for today.

05:55.584 --> 05:57.837
Your initial designs
are due next week.

06:00.422 --> 06:02.883
I finished my design
assignment early.

06:04.093 --> 06:05.886
I admire that initiative.

06:05.886 --> 06:08.514
Thank you,
I stayed up late to finish it.

06:08.514 --> 06:10.558
My normal bedtime is 2100 hours,

06:10.558 --> 06:12.560
but I was so excited to do it
that I took a power nap

06:12.560 --> 06:14.854
in my Meemaw's back seat
on the drive home.

06:14.854 --> 06:17.523
Uh, you'll need
to do this again. It's wrong.

06:18.941 --> 06:21.318
No, it's not.

06:21.318 --> 06:24.655
Son, I'm giving you
another chance before it's due.

06:25.781 --> 06:27.575
Well, what's wrong with it?

06:27.575 --> 06:29.201
That's your job to figure out.

06:29.201 --> 06:32.121
I would argue that
it's your job to teach me.

06:37.001 --> 06:38.502
Let's see.

06:38.502 --> 06:42.006
To start,
this bridge is in pieces.

06:42.006 --> 06:43.507
What do you mean?

06:50.055 --> 06:51.891
Well, two can play at this game.

07:00.316 --> 07:01.442
Well, now they can't.

07:05.718 --> 07:08.289
And then he ripped up my paper
right in front of me.

07:08.314 --> 07:09.857
What is this man's problem?

07:09.857 --> 07:11.984
I don't know.
He didn't even use a ruler.

07:11.984 --> 07:13.403
He just ripped it up,
willy-nilly.

07:13.403 --> 07:15.530
Do you want me to
call the school?

07:15.530 --> 07:18.324
No, he was in the Army.
I want him to think I'm tough.

07:18.324 --> 07:20.118
Sure.

07:20.118 --> 07:23.830
Well, I'm sorry
you had a bad day.

07:23.830 --> 07:26.416
How about a little
trip to RadioShack?

07:26.416 --> 07:29.419
RadioShack's not gonna
make this better.

07:29.419 --> 07:31.254
It's also not gonna
make it worse, so okay.

07:31.254 --> 07:33.005
You got it.

07:33.005 --> 07:35.842
Maybe he was just intimidated
by my intelligence.

07:35.842 --> 07:37.802
Or maybe he's an insecure bully

07:37.802 --> 07:40.430
taking out his frustrations
on a little boy.

07:40.430 --> 07:42.306
I like my version better
where I'm intimidating

07:42.306 --> 07:44.100
and not a helpless child.

07:44.100 --> 07:48.438
Okay, he's taking out
his frustrations on a powerful

07:48.438 --> 07:50.857
and intimidating young man.

07:50.857 --> 07:52.775
That works.

07:52.775 --> 07:54.026
WOMAN Romeo,

07:54.026 --> 07:56.112
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

07:56.112 --> 07:57.613
Hey, baby.

08:10.209 --> 08:11.627
Ballard's.

08:11.627 --> 08:13.963
It's me.
Any chance you could swing by?

08:13.963 --> 08:15.715
What do you need?

08:15.715 --> 08:17.300
Well, the recliner
won't go down,

08:17.300 --> 08:19.343
and I'm stuck in this chair
like a damn fool.

08:19.343 --> 08:21.637
Well, that is a situation.

08:21.637 --> 08:23.222
How long you been stuck?

08:23.222 --> 08:25.099
Are you gonna help me out
or not?

08:25.099 --> 08:27.226
Oh, just give me
a moment to enjoy it.

08:27.226 --> 08:29.812
Get your ass over here and
you can laugh at me in person.

08:29.812 --> 08:31.606
Eh, I'm on my way.

08:31.606 --> 08:32.982
Thank you.

08:32.982 --> 08:34.525
Got to grab my camera.

08:36.903 --> 08:39.489
You know it's bleak
when even a trip to RadioShack

08:39.489 --> 08:41.574
couldn't lift my spirits.

08:41.574 --> 08:44.744

09:05.515 --> 09:08.518
was pushing me to be

09:08.518 --> 09:10.603
You'd think the person

09:10.603 --> 09:12.897

I could be was me,

09:12.897 --> 09:16.150

to be the best he

10:17.169 --> 10:19.589
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

10:19.589 --> 10:22.258
Hello, Professor Boucher.
Please, come in, have a seat.

10:22.258 --> 10:24.010
I'd prefer to stand.

10:24.010 --> 10:28.014
Oh. All right, uh, then,
I will also stand.

10:30.266 --> 10:32.602
You know what, um, these are
really not standing shoes,

10:32.602 --> 10:34.437
so I'm just gonna sit.

10:34.437 --> 10:36.230
I was hoping that we
could have a little chat

10:36.230 --> 10:38.733
about Sheldon Cooper.

10:41.193 --> 10:43.195
I'll start.

10:43.195 --> 10:47.199
Sheldon is a very important
asset to this university.

10:47.199 --> 10:50.620
And we like to keep
that little fella happy.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.371
But it seems that
your teaching methods

10:52.371 --> 10:55.333
are making him unhappy.

10:55.333 --> 10:56.709
You understand?

10:56.709 --> 10:58.210
Yes, ma'am, I do.

10:58.210 --> 10:59.879
Great.

10:59.879 --> 11:02.965
You'd like me to turn
his frown upside down.

11:02.965 --> 11:05.092
You know, when you say it,

11:05.092 --> 11:09.597
it sounds more chilling
than fun.

11:09.597 --> 11:11.223
I'm just saying

11:11.223 --> 11:15.061
that he's a sensitive kid,
and you are...

11:15.061 --> 11:17.438
well, whatever this vibe is.

11:17.438 --> 11:19.065
I understand.

11:19.065 --> 11:22.443
Excellent, so you'll take it
easy on him?

11:22.443 --> 11:25.404
No. I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't do that.

11:25.404 --> 11:27.949
You see, uh...

11:27.949 --> 11:30.326
all these "ma'ams,"
they sound polite,

11:30.326 --> 11:32.787
but then I don't seem
to be getting anywhere.

11:32.787 --> 11:34.664
Well, that's because you're not.

11:35.831 --> 11:38.250
You do realize
that I'm your boss?

11:38.250 --> 11:39.752
Yes, ma'am, I do.

11:39.752 --> 11:42.755
And do you realize
that I have tenure?

11:42.755 --> 11:45.007
Ugh, tenure.

11:45.007 --> 11:46.467
What fun is it being president

11:46.467 --> 11:48.260
if I can't threaten
people's jobs?

11:48.260 --> 11:50.596
May I get back to class now?

11:50.596 --> 11:53.182
Oh, fine. And fall off,
or whatever it is.

11:53.182 --> 11:54.517
It's "dismissed," ma'am.

11:54.517 --> 11:56.352
Just go.

11:59.355 --> 12:01.148
I heard that giggle.

12:03.192 --> 12:05.152
Okay. Soup's on.

12:05.152 --> 12:07.488
Mmm. Wow, looks good.

12:07.488 --> 12:09.115
Oh, geez.

12:09.115 --> 12:10.282
Are you okay?

12:10.282 --> 12:12.994
Oh, I, uh, I tweaked my back.

12:12.994 --> 12:14.286
Oh. How?

12:14.286 --> 12:15.663
I was helping June out.

12:15.663 --> 12:18.290
Well, aren't you sweet?

12:18.290 --> 12:20.501
What'd she have
you doing for her?

12:21.752 --> 12:24.130
Yeah, this and that.

12:24.130 --> 12:26.298
This and that what?

12:26.298 --> 12:29.677
Yeah. This and that
and the other thing.

12:31.470 --> 12:33.639
Do you not want to tell me?

12:33.639 --> 12:38.227
Well, for the sake of honesty
and because she might tell you,

12:38.227 --> 12:40.396
I was helping her take a shower.

12:41.522 --> 12:43.357
You took a shower with her?

12:43.357 --> 12:46.736
She took the shower,
I was just assisting.

12:46.736 --> 12:48.112
So she was naked.

12:48.112 --> 12:50.322
For crying out loud,
we were married.

12:50.322 --> 12:51.991
I've seen her naked
a million times.

12:51.991 --> 12:53.659
You think that is helping?

12:53.659 --> 12:55.494
I knew I shouldn't
have been honest.

12:55.494 --> 12:58.664
You shouldn't have been
playing bathroom attendant.

12:58.664 --> 13:00.583
There was nothing sexy about it.

13:00.583 --> 13:03.169
It was like washing a car.

13:03.169 --> 13:04.837
A rusty old car.

13:04.837 --> 13:06.589
Did you scrub her windshield?

13:06.589 --> 13:09.216
What does that even mean?

13:09.216 --> 13:11.093
Her boobs, genius.

13:12.219 --> 13:14.180
I was helping her in the shower

13:14.180 --> 13:16.182
so she didn't fall down.

13:17.558 --> 13:19.060
Well, fine.

13:19.060 --> 13:20.686
And boobs are headlights.

13:20.686 --> 13:22.730
Everybody knows that.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.524
What are you doing?

13:35.524 --> 13:37.317
Watching Sheldon
struggle with homework.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.527
It's so great.

13:41.405 --> 13:42.739
Come on, think.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.158
What's going on?
I can't

13:45.158 --> 13:47.077
figure out
this engineering project.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.580
And every time I turn it in,
my professor just rips it up.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.665
Well, ain't this
the fella you liked?

13:51.665 --> 13:54.209
I did, when I thought he was
pushing me to be all I could be,

13:54.209 --> 13:56.545
but it turns out
all he can be is mean.

13:56.545 --> 13:58.881
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.757
Could you talk to him?

14:00.757 --> 14:02.509
You're in college now.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.344
Don't you think you should
fight your own battles?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.762
Does telling on him
to the president

14:05.762 --> 14:07.055
of the university count?

14:07.055 --> 14:08.056
Did it work?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.850
No.
Then no.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.351
Will you please talk to him?

14:11.351 --> 14:13.854
Ooh, what if your mom does it?

14:13.854 --> 14:15.355
But you were both in the Army.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.607
And you're both
crabby and impatient.

14:16.607 --> 14:18.442
There's a lot of common ground.

14:18.442 --> 14:21.111
You really got under
this guy's skin, huh?

14:21.111 --> 14:22.404
It would seem so.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.615
Lot of common ground.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.330
Hello.

14:31.330 --> 14:32.581
Hey, June.

14:32.581 --> 14:34.041
Connie.
Just wanted to see

14:34.041 --> 14:35.500
if you need anything.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.377
Nah, I'm good,
but thank you, though.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.712
You sure?

14:38.712 --> 14:41.715
Groceries? Dishes?

14:41.715 --> 14:43.759
Help in the shower?

14:44.718 --> 14:46.219
Damn it, Dale.

14:46.219 --> 14:47.429
I'm sorry,

14:47.429 --> 14:48.555
I'm just not
comfortable with it.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.307
You think I am?

14:50.307 --> 14:53.894
Last time he saw me naked,
gravity was on my side.

14:53.894 --> 14:55.479
Then why'd you ask him to do it?

14:55.479 --> 14:57.731
Who else am I gonna ask, Connie?

14:57.731 --> 14:59.316
You got tons of friends.

14:59.316 --> 15:02.569
I've got acquaintances,
I've got clients.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.029
Those aren't exactly people

15:04.029 --> 15:05.906
you want looking
at your hernia scar.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.741
And Dale is?

15:07.741 --> 15:10.327
I got that hernia
by dragging him onto the bed

15:10.327 --> 15:12.788
one night he came in
passed-out drunk.

15:12.788 --> 15:14.623
Look, I'm sorry if I

15:14.623 --> 15:17.167
crossed the line, but you have
nothing to worry about.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.330
Okay.

15:21.330 --> 15:23.040
Look, I promise, next time,

15:23.040 --> 15:25.334
I'll get the kid
who mows my lawn

15:25.334 --> 15:27.211
to come over and hose me off
in the backyard.

15:27.211 --> 15:29.213
Call me.

15:29.213 --> 15:32.382
I'd be happy to hose you off
in the backyard.

15:34.718 --> 15:36.637
I got to admit,
I'm a little jealous.

15:36.637 --> 15:37.471
Of what?

15:37.471 --> 15:38.847
You.

15:38.847 --> 15:40.015
Why?

15:40.015 --> 15:42.643
You have the Dale I never got.

15:42.643 --> 15:44.478
I spent a lot of time

15:44.478 --> 15:47.564
polishing that turd,
and you get all the benefits.

15:47.564 --> 15:49.733
Hey, I put my time in
on that, too.

15:49.733 --> 15:51.151
Not as much as me.

15:51.151 --> 15:53.195
When I met him, he was a mess.

15:53.195 --> 15:56.990
You should've seen
where I started.

15:56.990 --> 15:58.992
Well, I think we can both agree,

15:58.992 --> 16:01.161
he is one lucky turd.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.664
Amen, sister.

16:03.664 --> 16:06.250
So, let me guess.

16:06.250 --> 16:07.960
You think I'm being
too hard on him

16:07.960 --> 16:09.544
and you want me to lighten up?

16:09.544 --> 16:11.088
He is having a tough time.

16:11.088 --> 16:12.422
It's a tough class.

16:12.422 --> 16:13.757
Look, I get it.

16:13.757 --> 16:15.175
I was in the Army, too,

16:15.175 --> 16:17.219
I-I'm all for being
strict, but...

16:17.219 --> 16:19.471
he doesn't even know
where he's going wrong.

16:19.471 --> 16:21.014
You know, maybe you could just

16:21.014 --> 16:22.683
point him
in the right direction?

16:22.683 --> 16:24.601
You mean, give him the answer?

16:24.601 --> 16:26.520
No, no.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.688
Would you?

16:27.688 --> 16:29.189
What do you think?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.733
No.
See?

16:31.733 --> 16:34.403
I didn't give you the answer
and you figured it out.

16:34.403 --> 16:36.363
Look...

16:37.739 --> 16:40.367
...your son
is obviously brilliant,

16:40.367 --> 16:43.036
but coddling him won't prepare
him for the real world.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.872
I've been saying that
since the day he was born.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.375
Sometimes you have to break
them down to build them back up.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.043
I do that
with my football players.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.170
At least, I try to,
but then the parents

16:52.170 --> 16:54.548
get all bent out of shape,
they come into my office.

16:54.548 --> 16:56.300
You don't say.

16:56.300 --> 16:58.135
Yeah, you would not believe...

16:58.135 --> 17:01.263
Oh. Y-You mean me.
Got it.

17:01.263 --> 17:03.390
You figured it out again.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.809
Hey, I'm two for two.

17:08.729 --> 17:10.063
Hey.

17:10.063 --> 17:11.440
Did you talk to my teacher?

17:11.440 --> 17:12.941
I did.

17:12.941 --> 17:14.776
So, is he gonna tell me
what I'm doing wrong?

17:14.776 --> 17:16.570
I'm going to.

17:16.570 --> 17:18.572
You're sitting here waiting
to be handed the answer

17:18.572 --> 17:20.282
and that's not how life is.

17:20.282 --> 17:21.992
You got to work for it.

17:21.992 --> 17:24.077
I don't want to hear
a football pep talk.
Hey.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.705
This isn't football.
This is real.

17:26.705 --> 17:28.123
Your professor's right.

17:28.123 --> 17:29.499
Now, instead
of pouting,

17:29.499 --> 17:31.877
take charge of your own life.

17:35.297 --> 17:36.590
My dad was right.

17:36.590 --> 17:38.342
I had to take charge.

17:38.342 --> 17:41.094
And after 20 more minutes
of pouting,

17:41.094 --> 17:43.096
that's exactly what I did.

17:43.096 --> 17:45.140
But despite my best efforts,

17:45.140 --> 17:48.268
I was still no closer
to figuring it out.

17:48.268 --> 17:49.895
I was going to have
to see my work

17:49.895 --> 17:52.522
be torn to pieces one more time.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.278
Of course.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.614
I'd been so focused
on mathematical perfection

18:00.614 --> 18:03.700
that I hadn't taken into account
real-world elements.

18:03.700 --> 18:05.952
Wind can trigger vibrations.

18:05.952 --> 18:08.914
If these vibrations occur at
a system's resonant frequency,

18:08.914 --> 18:11.041
then oscillation
generates excitation

18:11.041 --> 18:14.211
and a bridge can lose
its structural integrity.

18:14.211 --> 18:16.797
Okay, I'm a genius again.

18:16.797 --> 18:18.673
I couldn't wait
to hand in my paper

18:18.673 --> 18:20.842
and see the proud look
on Professor Boucher's...

18:22.969 --> 18:24.012
No!

18:24.012 --> 18:25.347
I figured it out!

18:25.347 --> 18:27.849
It's wind! It's wind!

18:29.393 --> 18:33.146
I hate engineering.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.148
Wait, so after all this time,

18:35.148 --> 18:36.858
that's your problem
with engineering?

18:36.858 --> 18:38.151
Evidently.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.945
So all the teasing

18:39.945 --> 18:42.322
and all the abuse
had nothing to do with me?

18:42.322 --> 18:44.324
I'll admit, at first,
I had a chip on my shoulder

18:44.324 --> 18:47.744
because of that class,
but then it was mostly you.

18:47.744 --> 18:49.579
Unbelievable. When will I learn?

18:49.579 --> 18:51.164
I could give you that answer,

18:51.164 --> 18:52.207
but if you figure it out
for yourself,

18:52.207 --> 18:54.042
it'll mean so much more.

18:54.042 --> 18:55.669
Goodbye, Sheldon.
Bye.

18:59.466 --> 19:00.710
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

19:00.735 --> 19:02.219
Professor.

19:02.219 --> 19:05.601
I understand you locked
Sheldon out of class.

19:05.626 --> 19:07.920
Well, he was late.
That's my policy.

19:07.920 --> 19:09.797
I need you to do me a favor.

19:10.798 --> 19:12.300
Yes?

19:12.300 --> 19:14.135
Tell me exactly
what his face looked like

19:14.135 --> 19:15.636
when it happened.

19:15.636 --> 19:17.555
Wh... Seriously?

19:17.555 --> 19:19.432
Oh... Paint me a picture.

19:19.432 --> 19:22.226
I want to feel like I was
the one who closed that door.

19:22.226 --> 19:23.894
Oh, I'm gonna sit for this.

19:23.894 --> 19:26.397
Okay, so he approached

19:26.397 --> 19:28.316
the door with that smug look
he has.

19:28.316 --> 19:30.818
Ugh. I know it well.
Then,

19:30.818 --> 19:32.653
when he realized
it was locked,

19:32.653 --> 19:36.949

you have turned my frown
upside down.

19:52.423 --> 19:55.468
You are welcome, ma'am.
