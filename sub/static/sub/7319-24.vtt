00:11.367 --> 00:12.433
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:12.467 --> 00:16.367
YOU'RE GONNA TRANSFER
TO MERCY WEST?
I HAVE TO.

00:16.400 --> 00:17.867
GIVE ME MY HUSBAND BACK.

00:17.900 --> 00:21.133
CHIEF RESIDENT?
THE ONE FIFTH YEAR RESIDENT
THAT RULES ALL RESIDENTS.

00:21.167 --> 00:22.533
YOUR INTERN EXAMS
ARE IN TWO WEEKS.

00:22.567 --> 00:24.833
YOU NEED TO SPEND EVERY
AVAILABLE MINUTE STUDYING

00:24.867 --> 00:28.167
FOR THEM.
WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR
SMALL CEREMONY?

00:28.200 --> 00:30.533
WHAT HAPPENED YOU AND ME
AT CITY HALL?
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE

00:30.567 --> 00:32.467
THE SURGERY'S GONNA BRING BACK
YOUR MEMORY.
IS THERE A MAN IN MY HOUSE?

00:32.500 --> 00:34.767
I'M SO SORRY, RICHARD.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.833
AND I'M FINALLY READY TO HAVE
A BABY, AND I CAN'T.

00:36.867 --> 00:38.733
(Meredith) WE'RE LOSING
HER PULSE. SHE'S CODING!

00:38.767 --> 00:41.300
WE DID EVERYTHING
WE COULD.

00:43.600 --> 00:46.467
(rain falling)

00:46.500 --> 00:49.300
***

00:49.333 --> 00:51.033
(Meredith)
A SURGEON'S EDUCATION

00:51.067 --> 00:52.500
NEVER ENDS.

00:52.533 --> 00:56.367
EVERY PATIENT, EVERY SYMPTOM,
EVERY OPERATION...

00:56.400 --> 00:58.400
IS A TEST,

00:58.433 --> 01:01.400
A CHANCE FOR US TO DEMONSTRATE
HOW MUCH WE KNOW...

01:01.433 --> 01:04.467
AND HOW MUCH MORE
WE HAVE TO LEARN.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.333
"HOW DO YOU TREAT
PANCREATIC DIVISUM?" IZZIE?

01:07.367 --> 01:08.167
OH, CRISTINA.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.933
IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA LET US SLEEP,

01:09.967 --> 01:13.067
YOU AT LEAST HAVE TO LET ME
PUT COFFEE IN MY CUP.
OKAY, SO GO.
NO ONE'S STOPPING YOU.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.233
I'M TOO TIRED TO GO.
PANCREATIC DIVISUM.

01:15.267 --> 01:18.167
DORSAL DUCT SPHINCTEROTOMY.
NOT YOUR TURN, BUT CORRECT.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.333
YOU DO ME.
I CAN'T BELIEVE O'MALLEY'S
MISSING THIS.

01:20.367 --> 01:22.400
HOW'S HE GONNA BE READY?
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

01:22.433 --> 01:24.767
WE HAVE CALLIE'S CARDS,
BUT GEORGE HAS--
GEORGE HAS CALLIE.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.100
"WHAT'S
THE MOST FREQUENT CAUSE

01:27.133 --> 01:29.100
OF DIARRHEA
IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS?"

01:29.133 --> 01:31.200
IS SHE COMING TO THIS
BACHELORETTE THING TONIGHT?

01:31.233 --> 01:32.433
ROTAVIRUS. YES.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.333
UH, NO! NO, NO, NO.
UH, SALMONELLA.

01:34.367 --> 01:36.367
DIARRHEA IN
HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS.
OH.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.300
THE MOST FREQUENT CAUSE
OF DIARRHEA

01:38.333 --> 01:40.567
IN HOSPITALIZED PATIENTS
IS C. DIFF,

01:40.600 --> 01:42.400
WHICH CAN LEAD
TO TOXIC MEGACOLON,

01:42.433 --> 01:44.733
PERFORATION,
SEPSIS AND DEATH.

01:44.767 --> 01:46.467
THAT'S WHAT KILLED SUSAN.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.067
***

01:50.100 --> 01:52.833
IS SHE OKAY?
OH, SHE'S FINE.

01:52.867 --> 01:55.200
DUDE, SHE'S MESSED UP.
OF COURSE SHE'S MESSED UP.

01:55.233 --> 01:57.433
SUSAN WAS BASICALLY
HER SURROGATE MOTHER.

01:57.467 --> 02:00.133
YEAH, HER FAKE MOM WAS BETTER
THAN HER REAL MOM.

02:00.167 --> 02:02.733
IS SHE GOING TO THE HOSPITAL
FIRST OR THE FUNERAL?

02:02.767 --> 02:05.467
FIRST TO THE HOSPITAL,
THEN TO THE FUNERAL,

02:05.500 --> 02:07.333
THEN TO THE TEST
THIS AFTERNOON.

02:07.367 --> 02:09.267
HAS SHE EVEN STUDIED?
YEAH, SHE STUDIED.
SHE'S FINE.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.733
SHE JUST NEEDS
TO BE LEFT ALONE, OKAY?

02:10.767 --> 02:13.567
SO... "WHAT'S INSIDE
THE CAROTID SHEATH?" IZZIE?

02:13.600 --> 02:15.133
(George) THE INTERNAL
CAROTID ARTERY,

02:15.167 --> 02:17.100
THE INTERNAL JUGULAR VEIN
AND THE VAGUS NERVE.

02:17.133 --> 02:20.400
AH, THAT WAS TOO EASY.
LET'S FIND YOU A HARD ONE.

02:20.433 --> 02:22.533
(clears throat)
UH, WHAT IS THIS?

02:22.567 --> 02:25.833
(George) UH, WHAT IS WHAT?

02:25.867 --> 02:27.733
OH, YEAH.
THAT JUST CAME THIS MORNING.

02:27.767 --> 02:30.067
YOU GOT... YOU GOT A SPOT
AT MERCY WEST!

02:30.100 --> 02:33.167
WHY--WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.633
BECAUSE IT'S PENDING THE RESULTS
OF THE INTERN EXAM.

02:35.667 --> 02:37.567
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS, DON'T YOU?

02:37.600 --> 02:39.467
* YOU, YOU GOT,
YOU GOT INTO MERCY WEST *

02:39.500 --> 02:42.733
* YOU GOT INTO MERCY WEST
I HAVEN'T TOLD THE CHIEF YET.

02:42.767 --> 02:44.667
SO. YOU'LL TELL HIM TODAY.
HE'LL UNDERSTAND.

02:44.700 --> 02:46.833
IT'S A SMALLER PROGRAM,
FEWER RESIDENTS...

02:46.867 --> 02:48.667
(pager beeps)
FEWER DISTRACTIONS,

02:48.700 --> 02:50.200
MORE SURGERIES.

02:50.233 --> 02:53.067
AND WHEN I COME HOME
AND ASK YOU HOW YOUR DAY WENT,

02:53.067 --> 02:57.133
YOU CAN ACTUALLY TELL ME
BECAUSE I WON'T ALREADY KNOW.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.600
(laughs)

03:01.267 --> 03:02.500
(laughs)

03:02.533 --> 03:07.367
***

03:07.400 --> 03:09.200
(elevator bell dings)

03:09.233 --> 03:12.767
***

03:16.700 --> 03:17.767
HI.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.733
HI.

03:22.333 --> 03:24.767
LOOK, I...

03:24.800 --> 03:27.800
I KNOW THIS IS A--
AN IMPOSSIBLE DAY FOR YOU,

03:27.833 --> 03:31.100
SO... I'M JUST WANT TO SAY
ONE THING.

03:32.633 --> 03:34.733
I BROUGHT A BLACK SUIT,

03:34.767 --> 03:36.100
JUST IN CASE.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.633
THANK YOU.

03:37.667 --> 03:40.500
BUT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING
I NEED TO DO BY MYSELF.

03:40.533 --> 03:43.400
***

03:43.433 --> 03:44.600
(pager beeps)

03:44.633 --> 03:47.600
(beep)

03:47.633 --> 03:50.133
IF YOU NEED ME, JUST...

03:50.167 --> 03:52.400
LET ME KNOW.

03:53.767 --> 03:55.267
OH, CRISTINA.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.200
"WHAT IS M.E.N. SYNDROME?"
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.100
THE MINISTER NEEDS TO SEE
A COPY OF YOUR VOWS

03:59.133 --> 04:01.433
BEFORE THE WEDDING.
MULTIPLE ENDOCRINE NEOPLASIA.

04:01.467 --> 04:04.367
YES.
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S TEST DAY,
AND I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE

04:04.400 --> 04:06.300
TALKING ABOUT THE WEDDING
ON TEST DAY,

04:06.333 --> 04:09.300
BUT SINCE TOMORROW'S
OUR WEDDING DAY--
YOU HAVE FIVE SECONDS. GO.

04:09.333 --> 04:13.433
BILL ADAMS CAN'T MAKE IT.
I HAVE NO BEST MAN.

04:13.467 --> 04:16.567
OH, NO. BABY, I'M SO SORRY.
AND I NEED YOUR VOWS BY--

04:16.600 --> 04:18.633
OKAY, TIME'S UP.
CRISTINA...

04:18.667 --> 04:21.133
TEST DAY.

04:21.167 --> 04:23.467
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO TELL THE MINISTER?

04:24.800 --> 04:26.300
(pager beeps)

04:26.333 --> 04:28.467
THEY PAGED YOU GUYS, TOO?
(Derek) MM-HMM.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.400
WELL, I THINK THEY PAGED
ALL OF US.

04:30.433 --> 04:32.567
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.
SURE IT CAN.

04:32.600 --> 04:36.067
HE COULD BE LETTING US KNOW
I WON THE RACE FOR CHIEF.
NOT TODAY, HE ISN'T.

04:36.067 --> 04:38.233
HE'S MAKING HIS RECOMMENDATION
TO THE BOARD TOMORROW

04:38.267 --> 04:41.133
FOR CHIEF OF SURGERY
AND CHIEF RESIDENT.
(Derek) WHY WERE WE ALL PAGED?

04:41.167 --> 04:43.100
OH, BECAUSE SEARCH AND RESCUE
FOUND THOSE LOST CLIMBERS

04:43.133 --> 04:45.733
WHO WERE UP ON MOUNT RAINIER.
PEOPLE, THE CLIMBERS
ARE ON THEIR WAY.

04:45.767 --> 04:47.333
ANY SPECIFICS?

04:47.367 --> 04:49.667
THEY FOUND ONLY THREE SO FAR.
ONE'S STILL MISSING.

04:49.700 --> 04:51.433
THEY'RE REPORTING
SEVERE DEHYDRATION

04:51.467 --> 04:53.433
WITH TRAUMATIC HEAD
AND CHEST INJURIES.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.367
DR. BAILEY, DR. TORRES,
YOU'LL BE MY TRAUMA TEAM.
BAD DAY NOT TO HAVE INTERNS.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.767
WHAT?
TODAY'S THE INTERN EXAM.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.433
YOU'LL ALL HAVE TO DO YOUR OWN
HEAVY LIFTING TODAY.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.833
AND IF YOU SEE AN INTERN,

05:01.867 --> 05:04.100
WHICH YOU WILL, BECAUSE THEY
CAN'T HELP THEMSELVES,

05:04.133 --> 05:06.200
TURN THEM AWAY
UNTIL AFTER THE EXAM.

05:06.233 --> 05:07.700
THE AMBULANCES
ARE FIVE MINUTES AWAY.

05:07.733 --> 05:09.600
IT'S TIME TO DO WHAT
WE DO BEST, PEOPLE. LET'S ROLL.

05:09.633 --> 05:10.800
"WHAT IS A GEROTA'S FASCIA?"

05:10.833 --> 05:12.733
UH, THE FASCIA SURROUNDING
THE KIDNEY.

05:12.767 --> 05:15.633
YEP. "WHICH IS LONGER, THE LEFT
OR THE RIGHT RENAL VEIN?"

05:15.667 --> 05:17.567
(baby gurgles)
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE LEFT ONE.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.333
LOOKS AND SMARTS--
NOT BAD.

05:19.367 --> 05:22.133
YOU THINK? SHE'S GOT
MY DAD'S NOSE, THOUGH.

05:22.167 --> 05:23.333
GIRL'S GOTTA HAVE

05:23.367 --> 05:26.333
A BIG PERSONALITY
TO PULL OFF THAT NOSE.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.433
WHAT?
YOU--YOU REMEMBER YOUR DAD?

05:28.467 --> 05:29.800
(baby cooing)

05:29.833 --> 05:31.733
NO. I DON'T--NO.
YOU JUST SAID--

05:31.767 --> 05:33.267
I KNOW, BUT I...

05:33.300 --> 05:35.533
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE THAT CAME FROM.

05:35.567 --> 05:38.100
THAT WAS A MEMORY. THAT'S WHAT
IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.267
IT DOESN'T ALWAYS
COME BACK ALL AT ONCE.

05:40.300 --> 05:43.267
IT CAN HAPPEN IN BITS
AND PIECES.
DON'T--DON'T GET ALL--

05:43.300 --> 05:45.467
DUDE,
YOUR MEMORY'S COMING BACK.

05:48.733 --> 05:52.567
SO HOW YOU FEELIN', PRESTON?
YOU READY?

05:52.600 --> 05:54.100
I'M ALWAYS READY
FOR SURGERY.

05:54.133 --> 05:56.067
I THINK HE'S TALKING ABOUT
THE WEDDING.

05:56.067 --> 05:57.767
YEAH, TOMORROW'S THE BIG DAY.
AND APART FROM THE FACT

05:57.800 --> 05:59.700
THAT CRISTINA
HASN'T WRITTEN HER VOWS,

05:59.733 --> 06:01.600
MY BEST MAN JUST CANCELED,
AND IT'S STILL RAINING...

06:01.633 --> 06:04.367
HE'S NOT READY.
YOU'RE NEVER READY.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.600
I CERTAINLY WASN'T.

06:05.633 --> 06:10.233
BUT THEN... THE MINUTE I SAW
ADELE COMING DOWN THAT AISLE...

06:12.067 --> 06:13.533
WELL...

06:13.567 --> 06:16.133
HAVE YOU PICKED
YOUR BEST MAN?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.067
ACTUALLY, CHIEF, I--

06:18.067 --> 06:19.600
YOU CAN'T BE HIS BEST MAN.

06:19.633 --> 06:21.333
WHY NOT?
BECAUSE IT'S UNETHICAL.

06:21.367 --> 06:22.600
IT'S A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.

06:22.633 --> 06:25.233
THE MAN WANTS TO BE
CHIEF OF SURGERY.
ACTUALLY, DEREK--

06:25.267 --> 06:27.500
NOT THAT
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE ASKING.

06:27.533 --> 06:29.333
I WAS... GOING TO ASK YOU.

06:29.367 --> 06:31.800
ASK ME WHAT?

06:31.833 --> 06:34.100
OH.

06:34.133 --> 06:37.200
REALLY?
WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH
A LOT THIS YEAR.

06:37.233 --> 06:40.133
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
TURNED YOU DOWN.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.833
OH, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?

06:41.867 --> 06:43.733
WELL, TRADITIONALLY THE BEST MAN
PLANS THE BACHELOR PARTY.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.467
DRINKS AT JOE'S AFTER WORK?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.600
YEAH. I KNEW YOU WERE
THE MAN FOR THE JOB.

06:47.633 --> 06:51.767
(sirens whooping)

06:51.800 --> 06:55.800
DALE WINICK, 32,
B.P. 90 OVER 50, TACHY TO 110.

06:55.833 --> 06:59.100
SEVERE FROSTBITE, BUT NO
OBVIOUS INTERNAL INJURIES.
(man) GOT IT.

06:59.133 --> 07:01.167
(Richard) MY GOD.
(Derek) WOW.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.633
(man) YEAH,
THOSE AREN'T GLOVES.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.833
PLEASE, SOMEONE TELL ME,
ARE THE OTHER GUYS OKAY?

07:16.867 --> 07:18.767
THEY'RE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
WE'LL LET YOU KNOW.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.667
GET HIM A Tet-Tox AND PUSH
A GRAM OF CEFAZOLIN I.V.

07:21.700 --> 07:23.600
AND LET'S GET SOME WARM,
CIRCULATING WATER

07:23.633 --> 07:26.133
TO START THAWING HIS HANDS.
I'LL GET SOMEONE ON IT.
CALLIE.

07:26.167 --> 07:27.500
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE STUDYING.

07:27.533 --> 07:29.433
IF BAILEY FINDS OUT
WE'RE DOWN HERE--

07:29.467 --> 07:31.333
WE ARE STUDYING.
HOW DO YOU TREAT FROSTBITE?

07:31.367 --> 07:32.700
REWARM, AVOID EARLY SURGERY

07:32.733 --> 07:34.667
UNLESS THERE'S A DEEP INFECTION
DUE TO AUTOAMPUTATION.

07:34.700 --> 07:37.233
SEE? STUDYING.

07:37.267 --> 07:38.733
(man screams)

07:38.767 --> 07:40.400
(Preston)
OKAY, OKAY, MR. MELTZER,

07:40.433 --> 07:43.100
MR. MELTZER, I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO SAVE YOUR BREATH, OKAY?

07:43.133 --> 07:45.467
WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
SOME PAIN MEDS.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.400
YOU HAVE SEVERAL BROKEN RIBS,
WHICH ARE COMPROMISING

07:47.433 --> 07:49.200
YOUR BREATHING.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

07:49.233 --> 07:51.133
DID YOU SEE THAT?
THAT IS FREAKY.

07:51.167 --> 07:54.067
I THINK THAT WAS A FLAIL CHEST.
I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BEFORE.

07:54.067 --> 07:55.667
COME ON. COME ON.

07:55.700 --> 07:59.233
WHY, OH, WHY DOES TODAY
HAVE TO BE TEST DAY?
OH, I KNOW.

07:59.267 --> 08:01.600
LOOK... I BET YOU
IF YOU TALK TO THE CHIEF,

08:01.633 --> 08:03.533
HE'LL LET YOU
TAKE THE TEST LATER,

08:03.567 --> 08:05.067
WITH THE FUNERAL
AND EVERYTHING.

08:05.100 --> 08:07.833
I DON'T NEED
TO TAKE THE TEST LATER.

08:07.867 --> 08:09.600
OKAY.

08:09.633 --> 08:12.633
(Derek) CAN I GET
A LITTLE HELP HERE?

08:12.667 --> 08:14.567
I CAN'T FEEL MY LEGS!
SIR, YOU HAVE A SPINAL INJURY.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.500
YOU NEED TO STOP FIGHTING ME
AND STAY CALM, OKAY?

08:16.533 --> 08:18.400
YOU'RE ONLY MAKING IT WORSE.
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

08:18.433 --> 08:20.300
YOU GUYS ARE GOING
TO TRAUMA THREE.
ALL RIGHT. TRAUMA THREE.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.767
YOU OKAY?

08:22.800 --> 08:26.567
YEAH. I GOT ACCEPTED
AT MERCY WEST.

08:26.600 --> 08:29.833
WOW. THAT'S...

08:29.867 --> 08:31.367
ARE YOU GONNA GO?

08:31.400 --> 08:34.500
WELL, I KINDA HAVE TO NOW,
RIGHT?

08:34.533 --> 08:37.567
WHAT ARE YOU FOOLS
DOING HERE?

08:37.600 --> 08:39.433
IN A FEW HOURS, YOU PEOPLE
ARE TAKING A TEST

08:39.467 --> 08:42.333
THAT WILL DETERMINE THE COURSE
OF YOUR ENTIRE MEDICAL CAREERS,

08:42.367 --> 08:44.267
BECAUSE THE FIVE INTERNS
WITH THE LOWEST TEST SCORES

08:44.300 --> 08:46.133
WILL BE CUT
FROM THE PROGRAM.

08:46.167 --> 08:48.067
BUT ARE YOU STUDYING
FOR THIS TEST?

08:48.100 --> 08:49.667
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

08:49.700 --> 08:51.800
ARE YOU HELPING OUT IN THE E.R.?
YOU ARE MOST CERTAINLY NOT!

08:51.833 --> 08:54.667
ARE YOU GETTING THE HELL OUT
OF HERE BEFORE I THROW YOU OUT?

08:54.700 --> 08:56.333
I THINK YOU ARE.

08:56.367 --> 08:57.300
HEY.

08:57.333 --> 08:58.667
WHOA, DR. SHEPHERD.

08:58.700 --> 09:00.600
AREN'T YOU
SUPPOSED TO BE STUDYING?

09:00.633 --> 09:02.533
YEAH, I JUST HAVE
A QUICK QUESTION.
YEAH.

09:02.567 --> 09:04.467
COULD THE CRANIOTOMY YOU
PERFORMED ON AVA--ON JANE DOE--

09:04.500 --> 09:06.633
COULD--COULD THAT HAVE
AFFECTED HER MEMORY?
UH, IT'S DOUBTFUL.

09:06.667 --> 09:09.167
I WAS MOSTLY WORKING IN
THE SPEECH CENTER OF HER BRAIN.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.933
BUT YOU NEVER KNOW. WHY?
I THINK
SHE REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.833
CAN--CAN WE TEST HER TO SEE
IF ANYTHING'S CHANGED?
YEAH, YOU CAN RUN
ANOTHER W.M.S.R.

09:13.867 --> 09:15.767
BUT WE'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE

09:15.800 --> 09:18.533
IF SHE REMEMBERS ANYTHING ELSE.
GOOD SIGN, THOUGH.
THANKS.

09:18.567 --> 09:20.667
NICE WORK, DR. MONTGOMERY.
OH, THANKS. I WAS JUST
DIRECTING TRAFFIC.

09:20.700 --> 09:23.567
I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.
OH, LIKE BRAIN SURGERY
IS SO IMPRESSIVE.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.233
IT IS, ACTUALLY.

09:25.267 --> 09:26.200
ADDISON.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.300
YES? OH, JOE, WALTER.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.667
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?
EVERYTHING OKAY?

09:30.700 --> 09:32.600
YEAH, WE CAME TO SEE YOU,
ACTUALLY.

09:32.633 --> 09:35.133
UH, WE NEED A CONSULT.

09:35.167 --> 09:38.233
DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE PREGNANT.
UH, NO, BUT--

09:38.267 --> 09:39.567
OUR BIRTH MOM IS.
POTENTIAL BIRTH MOM.

09:39.600 --> 09:42.100
SHE HASN'T
ACTUALLY PICKED US YET.

09:42.133 --> 09:44.267
YOU'RE ADOPTING?
WELL, WE FILED AN APPLICATION,

09:44.300 --> 09:46.500
BUT WE NEVER THOUGHT
WE'D GET PICKED.

09:46.533 --> 09:49.067
YOU KNOW, BAR-OWNING GAYS
DON'T GET PICKED VERY OFTEN.

09:49.100 --> 09:51.333
I GUESS HAVING A BABY
IS EASIER THAN WE THOUGHT.

09:51.367 --> 09:52.700
YES, I GUESS SO.

09:52.733 --> 09:56.133
SO I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
TAKE A LOOK AT HER?

09:56.167 --> 09:59.300
YOU KNOW, KICKING THE TIRES,
CHECKING UNDERNEATH THE HOOD?
CAR METAPHORS? NO.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.033
I'D BE HAPPY TO.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.833
JUST, UH, GIVE ME A CALL
AND WE'LL SET UP AN APPOINTMENT.

10:02.867 --> 10:05.167
WELL, SEE, THAT'S THE THING.
UH, SHE LIVES IN PORTLAND,

10:05.200 --> 10:07.367
AND SHE'S ONLY GONNA BE
IN SEATTLE FOR ONE DAY, SO...

10:07.400 --> 10:09.567
SHE'S KIND OF HERE NOW.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.500
NOW, AS IN...

10:14.133 --> 10:15.333
NOW.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.567
GEORGE, WAIT. WAIT A MINUTE.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.033
YEAH?

10:23.067 --> 10:24.833
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

10:24.867 --> 10:26.767
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TRANSFER
TO MERCY WEST.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.267
YEAH, I DO.

10:28.300 --> 10:31.167
NO. JUST FORGET ABOUT
YOU AND ME FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

10:31.200 --> 10:33.333
WHAT ABOUT MEREDITH?
WHAT ABOUT ALEX AND CRISTINA?

10:33.367 --> 10:36.167
WHO'S GONNA HOLD US TOGETHER
IF YOU'RE NOT HERE?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.333
YOU'RE THE GLUE.
YOU'RE GEORGE.

10:37.367 --> 10:40.133
I CAN'T STAY HERE.
I CAN'T...
NO ONE'S MAKING YOU GO.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.633
STAY HERE
AND SEE YOU EVERY DAY...

10:42.667 --> 10:44.833
AND NOT...

10:44.867 --> 10:47.800
I CAN'T KEEP KISSING YOU
IN ELEVATORS.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.333
I KNOW.

10:49.367 --> 10:51.667
I KNOW THAT.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.333
I'M MARRIED.

10:53.367 --> 10:56.000
I'M A MARRIED MAN.

10:57.733 --> 11:00.067
(knocks on doorframe)
YOU BUSY?

11:00.100 --> 11:01.833
CUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:01.867 --> 11:03.767
ISN'T THE EXAM IN LIKE--
YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.733
I JUST WANT TO RUN A QUICK
NEURO-PSYCH TEST ON YOU.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.633
NO. NO! GO TAKE YOUR TEST.
I-I HAVE A BABY TO FEED.

11:09.667 --> 11:11.733
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?
NOTHING.

11:11.767 --> 11:13.667
YOU'VE BEEN SITTING
IN THIS BED FOR WEEKS

11:13.700 --> 11:16.067
WISHING YOU COULD REMEMBER WHO
YOU WERE, NOW SUDDENLY YOU CAN.

11:16.067 --> 11:18.533
I CAN'T.
IT WAS SOMETHING I SAID.
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
YOUR FATHER'S FACE.

11:18.567 --> 11:20.467
WHY ARE YOU ACTING
LIKE IT'S NO BIG DEAL,

11:20.500 --> 11:22.333
LIKE IT HAPPENS
ALL THE TIME?

11:22.367 --> 11:24.267
ALEX, COME ON. I-I--IT--
THAT'S NOT...

11:24.300 --> 11:29.067
UNLESS IT DOES HAPPEN
ALL THE TIME.

11:29.100 --> 11:30.833
TELL ME THE TRUTH.
DO YOU REMEMBER?

11:30.867 --> 11:33.667
DO YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE?

11:36.167 --> 11:37.300
"WHAT IS BILOMA?"

11:37.333 --> 11:39.833
CRISTINA, I REALLY
DON'T HAVE TIME--
WHAT IS BILOMA?

11:39.867 --> 11:40.900
OH.

11:40.933 --> 11:44.133
A BILOMA IS AN INTRAPERITONEAL
BILE FLUID COLLECTION.

11:44.167 --> 11:45.800
(Cristina) EXCELLENT.
OKAY? I'LL BE FINE.

11:45.833 --> 11:48.200
MEREDITH.
(sighs) GEORGE, I GOTTA GO.

11:48.233 --> 11:50.200
YOUR DAD.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.567
HEY. I-I-I WAS JUST
ON MY WAY--

11:52.600 --> 11:56.267
NO, I-I CAME HERE TO TELL YOU
YOU'RE NOT WANTED.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.533
I DON'T WANT YOU
AT ANY FUNERAL, MEREDITH.

11:58.567 --> 12:00.167
THATCHER, WHY DON'T YOU COME--
SHE TRUSTED YOU!

12:00.200 --> 12:03.533
SHE CAME TO YOU FOR HELP,
AND YOU KILLED HER.

12:03.567 --> 12:06.433
YOU DID. YOU KILLED MY WIFE.
YOU TOOK HER FROM ME.

12:06.467 --> 12:09.333
(Molly) DAD!
SO I DON'T--I DON'T WANT
TO SEE YOU.

12:09.367 --> 12:12.233
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
FROM YOU,

12:12.267 --> 12:14.567
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
ANYWHERE NEAR HER FUNERAL.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.500
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

12:16.533 --> 12:18.467
DAD, DAD, COME ON. THIS--
LEXIE'S WAITING IN THE CAR.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.400
WE HAVE TO GO, DAD.
WE HAVE TO GO NOW.

12:20.433 --> 12:22.400
SHE WAS EVERYTHING TO ME,
ALL I HAD.

12:27.800 --> 12:29.400
SHE WAS ALL I HAD.

12:29.433 --> 12:31.133
(elevator bell dings)

12:31.167 --> 12:33.167
SHE WAS ALL I HAD.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.100
I CAN SIT HERE ALL DAY.

12:49.133 --> 12:51.800
I'LL MISS MY TEST,
BUT I WILL SIT HERE ALL DAY.

12:51.833 --> 12:53.667
(sighs)

12:53.700 --> 12:56.333
I DON'T--I...

12:56.367 --> 12:58.267
IT HAPPENED A FEW DAYS AGO,

12:58.300 --> 12:59.500
AND I-I JUST...

12:59.533 --> 13:02.400
I JUST WOKE UP,
AND IT WAS ALL THERE AGAIN.

13:02.433 --> 13:05.167
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME?

13:05.200 --> 13:06.800
BECAU--

13:06.833 --> 13:09.133
BECAUSE THERE'S...

13:09.167 --> 13:11.267
THERE'S NOTHING TO TELL.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.267
WHY DON'T I BELIEVE THAT?

13:14.300 --> 13:18.167
I WAS A PREGNANT WOMAN
IN A LOUSY MARRIAGE

13:18.200 --> 13:20.733
TO THE NICEST GUY
ANYONE'S EVER MET.

13:20.767 --> 13:22.267
END OF STORY.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.667
(scoffs) WHO--WHO IS HE?
WHAT DOES HE DO?

13:24.700 --> 13:27.667
WH-WHERE--WHERE DID
YOU MEET HIM?

13:30.300 --> 13:33.067
(sighs) COLLEGE.

13:33.100 --> 13:34.833
WE GOT MARRIED
THE YEAR AFTER WE GRADUATED.

13:34.867 --> 13:37.700
HE... I WANTED--
I WANTED TO MOVE TO NEW YORK,

13:37.733 --> 13:40.600
AND HE WANTED TO LIVE
ON THE SIDE OF A MOUNTAIN

13:40.633 --> 13:42.500
AND TAKE OVER HIS DAD'S SHOP.

13:42.533 --> 13:44.433
AND HE'S A WOODWORKER.
HE MAKES BEAUTIFUL FURNITURE.

13:44.467 --> 13:47.367
IT'S--IT'S--IT'S QUIET,
AND HE'S QUIET AND...

13:47.400 --> 13:50.067
I WAS GOING OUT OF MY MIND.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.067
SO YOU JUST... TOOK OFF?

13:52.100 --> 13:53.833
NO, I...
I NEED--I NEED--I NEED--

13:53.867 --> 13:56.667
I NEEDED TO THINK
AND TO BE AROUND OTHER PEOPLE,

13:56.700 --> 13:59.300
SO I CAME TO SEATTLE,
AND I...

13:59.333 --> 14:01.500
THOUGHT I'D SEE THE SIGHTS,
RIDE THE FERRY.

14:01.533 --> 14:03.700
HAVE YOU EVEN CALLED HIM?
NO.

14:03.733 --> 14:06.067
WHY NOT?
I LEFT HIM, ALEX.

14:06.100 --> 14:07.800
SO? HE'S YOUR HUSBAND.
YOU SHOULD CALL HIM.

14:07.833 --> 14:11.133
YOU WANT ME TO CALL HIM?
I MEAN, WHAT'S HIS NAME?

14:11.167 --> 14:12.500
(chuckles)
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

14:12.533 --> 14:14.533
I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.433
(Cristina) WE'VE GOT
EVERYTHING TAKEN CARE OF.

14:18.467 --> 14:21.367
(George) YOU DON'T HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT A THING.
I'VE GOT NUMBER 2 PENCILS
AND BOTTLED WATER.

14:21.400 --> 14:23.267
OH, AND--AND PowerBars.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.400
AND YOU KNOW THE MATERIAL.
YOU'RE GONNA GET A HIGH SCORE--

14:26.433 --> 14:28.733
NOT AS HIGH AS MINE--
BUT EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.800
(Alex) WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
ALL STANDING AROUND FOR?

14:30.833 --> 14:34.433
DON'T WE HAVE A TEST TO--
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:34.467 --> 14:36.300
(Richard) YOU PEOPLE
NEED TO HEAD UPSTAIRS.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.467
DR. GREY WILL JOIN YOU
IN A MINUTE.

14:43.633 --> 14:46.067
YOU'RE NOT TO BLAME
FOR SUSAN GREY'S DEATH,

14:46.067 --> 14:48.767
AND YOU KNOW IT,
AND YOUR FATHER KNOWS IT, TOO.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.800
HE'S JUST...

14:50.833 --> 14:53.733
WELL, HE'S NEVER BEEN
THE BEST COMMUNICATOR,

14:53.767 --> 14:56.233
AND HE JUST LOST HIS WIFE.

14:56.267 --> 14:59.233
STOP ACTING LIKE
MY SURROGATE FATHER.

14:59.267 --> 15:01.067
MEREDITH, I'M J--

15:01.067 --> 15:02.800
JUST BECAUSE
YOU SLEPT WITH MY MOTHER,

15:02.833 --> 15:05.700
THAT DOES NOT
MAKE YOU MY FATHER.

15:08.600 --> 15:12.500
(Derek) FOLLOW MY FINGER, OKAY?

15:12.533 --> 15:13.700
GOOD.

15:13.733 --> 15:15.633
LET ME KNOW IF YOU CAN
FEEL THIS, OKAY?

15:15.667 --> 15:17.700
(inhales sharply) AH.

15:17.733 --> 15:19.500
YEAH, I'M NOT ENJOYING THAT.

15:19.533 --> 15:20.700
GOOD.

15:20.733 --> 15:22.267
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

15:22.300 --> 15:23.833
IT MEANS I'M NOT PARALYZED?

15:23.867 --> 15:26.467
WELL, THE M.R.I. WILL SHOW US
THE FULL EXTENT OF THE INJURIES.

15:26.500 --> 15:29.633
BUT, UH, CAN WE ASK YOU
WHAT HAPPENED UP THERE?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.600
IT WAS MY FAULT.
DALE--

15:36.633 --> 15:38.833
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT.
60 WAYS
TO GET UP MOUNT RAINIER,

15:38.867 --> 15:40.767
AND I HAD TO PICK
LIBERTY RIDGE?

15:40.800 --> 15:43.500
IT WASN'T THE ROUTE.
IT WAS THE STORM.

15:43.533 --> 15:46.267
ON A CLEAR DAY,
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT STORMS.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.367
A MINUTE LATER,

15:47.400 --> 15:49.433
THE WIND'S PASTING YOU
TO THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,

15:49.467 --> 15:51.667
AND YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR HAND
IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE.

15:51.700 --> 15:54.533
IS THAT WHY YOU FELL,
BECAUSE OF THE STORM?

15:54.567 --> 15:56.700
ALL I KNOW
IS I FELT THE ROPE TUG,

15:56.733 --> 15:58.700
AND... I WAS IN MIDAIR.

15:58.733 --> 16:00.133
WE ALL WERE.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.500
WE WERE TIED TOGETHER.

16:02.533 --> 16:04.600
MUST HAVE BEEN
A 100-FOOT DROP.

16:04.633 --> 16:07.067
AND WHEN WE CAME TO,
LONNIE WASN'T MOVING.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.833
LONNIE? HE'S YOUR FRIEND
WHO'S STILL MISSING?

16:08.867 --> 16:11.767
WELL, THIS LONNIE, IS THAT
WHY HE DIDN'T MAKE IT BACK,

16:11.800 --> 16:14.133
BECAUSE HE WAS HURT?

16:14.167 --> 16:16.200
BECAUSE HE WAS DEAD.

16:16.233 --> 16:18.233
I'M SORRY.

16:18.267 --> 16:19.800
WE HAD TO LEAVE HIM.

16:19.833 --> 16:22.700
WE HAD TO GET TO
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,

16:22.733 --> 16:24.067
OR WE'D BE DEAD, TOO.

16:24.100 --> 16:26.367
WE HAD NO CHOICE.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.700
YOU ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE.

16:28.733 --> 16:30.633
YOU NEVER LEAVE A MAN BEHIND.

16:32.633 --> 16:35.233
(woman) PLEASE TAKE
YOUR SEATS, DOCTORS,

16:35.267 --> 16:38.267
AND PUT
ALL STUDY MATERIALS AWAY.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.667
OKAY, IF YOU DON'T KNOW
THE ANSWER, CHOOSE "B."

16:40.700 --> 16:43.067
IT'S ALWAYS "B."
(woman) AND WRITE YOUR NAME

16:43.067 --> 16:46.667
IN THE UPPER RIGHT-HAND CORNER
OF YOUR ANSWER SHEETS.

16:49.567 --> 16:52.500
YOU MAY OPEN
YOUR TEST BOOKLETS...

16:52.533 --> 16:54.567
NOW.

16:57.333 --> 16:59.467
W-WE DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE
IF YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

16:59.500 --> 17:00.833
OH, NO, IT'S FINE.

17:00.867 --> 17:03.167
UN-UNLESS
YOU'RE UNCOMFORTABLE.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.533
ACTUALLY, UH, I-I--

17:04.567 --> 17:07.133
HE'S FINE.
(Addison) SO, RINA,
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

17:07.167 --> 17:08.633
ANY PROBLEMS?

17:08.667 --> 17:10.567
JUST THE FACT THAT I'M HUGE,

17:10.600 --> 17:12.533
AND I HAVE, LIKE,
THE WORST HEARTBURN

17:12.567 --> 17:15.433
I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.
I CAN PRESCRIBE
AN ANTACID FOR THAT.

17:15.467 --> 17:18.300
THE FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO
IS TAKE A LOOK AT THE BABY.

17:18.333 --> 17:20.300
THIS MIGHT BE A LITTLE COLD.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.733
(sighs) THIS BABY DESERVES
PARENTS WHO ARE GONNA MAKE IT

17:22.767 --> 17:24.267
THEIR WHOLE WORLD, YOU KNOW?

17:24.300 --> 17:26.833
Y-YOU KNOW WE'RE GAY,
RIGHT?

17:26.867 --> 17:29.800
I FIGURED, WITH YOU BOTH
BEING BOYS AND EVERYTHING.

17:29.833 --> 17:32.500
(chuckles) THE OTHER COUPLE
I'M CONSIDERING,

17:32.533 --> 17:34.433
THEY'RE, LIKE, OH, 40.

17:34.467 --> 17:38.067
SHE'S BEEN TRYING TO
GET PREGNANT FOR TEN YEARS.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.100
IT'S SO SAD.

17:40.133 --> 17:43.233
THERE'S THE HEARTBEAT.
(chuckles)

17:43.267 --> 17:44.833
(Joe) OH, WOW.
(Walter) I KNOW.

17:44.867 --> 17:47.067
THERE'S, LIKE,
A PERSON INSIDE OF ME.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.133
ACTUALLY...

17:48.167 --> 17:50.200
THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE.

17:50.233 --> 17:52.633
TWINS.
OH, MY GOD.

17:52.667 --> 17:54.067
OH, MY GOD.

17:54.067 --> 17:56.067
OH, MY GOD. I THINK
I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.267
JOE? JOE? WHOA. HEY, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA. COME ON.

17:58.300 --> 18:02.533
DOCTORS, WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH
OUR ALLOTTED TIME.

18:02.567 --> 18:07.067
YOU ONLY HAVE 60 MINUTES LEFT
TO COMPLETE THE EXAM.

18:39.833 --> 18:43.700
(clock ticking)

18:47.600 --> 18:48.767
MEREDITH.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.633
MEREDITH!

18:50.667 --> 18:53.133
WHAT?
SHE DIDN'T WRITE
ANYTHING ON THE TEST.

18:53.167 --> 18:55.067
SHE DIDN'T ANSWER
A SINGLE QUESTION.

18:55.100 --> 18:58.100
SHE JUST SAT THERE.
WAIT, G-GEORGE, JUST--

18:58.133 --> 18:59.667
JUST GIVE HER A SECOND.

18:59.700 --> 19:03.100
(Preston) I'VE GOT AN EXTENSIVE
ANTERO-LATERAL FLAIL CHEST.

19:03.133 --> 19:05.067
HE'LL NEED SURGICAL
STABILIZATION.

19:05.067 --> 19:07.133
DR. TORRES, IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE,
I WOULD REALLY--
SHE'S NOT.

19:07.167 --> 19:09.067
MY GUY HAS BONE FRAGMENTS
IN HIS SPINAL CORD,

19:09.100 --> 19:10.600
INTERNAL FIXATION.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.700
DR. TORRES IS GONNA
SCRUB IN WITH ME.
UH, WE HAVE

19:12.733 --> 19:14.633
MORE THAN ONE ORTHOPEDIC SURGEON
IN THIS HOSPITAL.

19:14.667 --> 19:17.567
AND YOU'LL NEED 'EM,
BECAUSE DR. TORRES AND I

19:17.600 --> 19:20.333
ARE LOOKING AT POSSIBLE
MULTIPLE AMPUTATIONS.
GUYS, I CAN BE THERE
FOR ALL OF YOU.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.667
WE JUST HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT.
DR. BURKE ASKED FIRST.
I JUST SAID THAT I--

19:22.700 --> 19:25.200
WELL, YEAH, I'D LIKE
TO SCHEDULE YOU FOR--
WELL, I MEAN,
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT--

19:25.233 --> 19:28.067
OKAY, YOU ALL WANT TORRES. FINE.
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.833
ONE, TWO, THREE.

19:29.867 --> 19:32.300
ALL ROCKS. VERY TYPICAL.
READY? AND...

19:32.333 --> 19:33.567
(laughs)

19:33.600 --> 19:36.233
ROCK SMASHES SCISSORS.
HA!

19:36.267 --> 19:39.600
(Callie) SEE YOU IN THE O.R.
BEST TWO OUT OF THREE.
DR. BURKE!

19:39.633 --> 19:41.400
(sighs)

19:41.433 --> 19:43.200
WHAT?

19:43.233 --> 19:45.367
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW
HOW IT FEELS...

19:45.400 --> 19:48.133
TO NOT HAVE TO SPEND
THE NEXT 24 HOURS

19:48.167 --> 19:51.167
WONDERING IF RICHARD PICKED YOU
TO BE CHIEF RESIDENT.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.100
HOW'S IT FEEL
TO BE THE CHOSEN ONE?

19:57.700 --> 20:00.367
FEELS JUST FINE.

20:02.567 --> 20:04.233
HEY.

20:04.267 --> 20:06.300
HOW'D IT GO?

20:06.333 --> 20:08.367
MEREDITH.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.267
DON'T WORRY. I'VE GOT IT.

20:13.767 --> 20:15.667
(Izzie) IT'S NOT LIKE
SHE ACTUALLY FLUNKED.

20:15.700 --> 20:17.767
SHE--SHE JUST DIDN'T
WRITE ANYTHING.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.633
IT'S KINDA LIKE
SHE ACTUALLY FLUNKED.
(sighs)

20:20.667 --> 20:22.133
ONE GUY TWO YEARS AGO,

20:22.167 --> 20:24.067
HE WAS ON CALL THREE NIGHTS
BEFORE HIS TEST.

20:24.100 --> 20:25.400
HE SLEPT THROUGH
THE WHOLE THING.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.400
HE HAD TO REPEAT
HIS INTERN YEAR.
SHE CAN'T REPEAT
HER INTERN YEAR.

20:28.433 --> 20:31.067
IT'S PATHETIC. WE HAVE TO
DO SOMETHING. CRISTINA.

20:31.100 --> 20:32.267
WHAT? O-OKAY, I DON'T KNOW.

20:32.300 --> 20:34.200
I MEAN, MEREDITH AND I
DON'T FAIL THINGS.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.500
THIS IS NOT IN MY BOOK.

20:36.533 --> 20:38.133
(pager beeps)

20:38.167 --> 20:40.600
IT'S BAILEY.
WE GOTTA GO. WE GOTTA GO.

20:40.633 --> 20:42.700
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HER HERE.
YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA?

20:53.367 --> 20:55.333
OKAY, IT'S, UH, SHOWTIME,
PEOPLE.

20:55.367 --> 20:58.033
YANG, YOU'RE SCRUBBING IN
WITH DR. BURKE.

20:58.067 --> 20:59.500
KAREV,
YOU'RE WITH DR. MONTGOMERY.

20:59.533 --> 21:02.067
STEVENS, FIND DR. SLOAN.

21:02.100 --> 21:03.767
YOU PAGED ME, TOO.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.833
MERCY WEST.
CALLIE TOLD YOU.

21:05.867 --> 21:09.533
YOU'RE IN THE BEST
SURGICAL PROGRAM IN THE COUNTRY,

21:09.567 --> 21:12.567
THE TOUGHEST, MOST COMPETITIVE,
MOST RESPECTED.

21:12.600 --> 21:14.500
YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS
FOR MERCY WEST?

21:14.533 --> 21:16.333
MERCY WEST--

21:16.367 --> 21:17.700
IS NOT SEATTLE GRACE.

21:17.733 --> 21:19.233
ARE YOU TRYING TO...

21:19.267 --> 21:21.167
AFTER ALL THE WORK
THAT WE'VE PUT INTO YOU,

21:21.200 --> 21:23.567
ARE YOU TRYING TO THROW
YOUR CAREER AWAY?

21:23.600 --> 21:25.733
I'M TRYING TO... DO WHAT'S
BEST FOR ME RIGHT NOW.

21:25.767 --> 21:28.467
I'VE HAD
SOME PERSONAL ISSUES.
I-I DON'T KNOW

21:28.500 --> 21:30.500
WHAT YOUR PERSONAL PROBLEMS ARE,
AND I DON'T CARE.

21:30.533 --> 21:33.400
I DO CARE ABOUT YOUR CAREER,
SO LET ME MAKE MYSELF CLEAR.

21:33.433 --> 21:35.300
THIS IS A MISTAKE.

21:42.867 --> 21:44.800
GEORGE...

22:00.500 --> 22:02.400
IT'S LIKE WE'RE ON A TRAIN

22:02.433 --> 22:04.300
THAT'S GOING 200 MILES
AN HOUR,

22:04.333 --> 22:09.100
AND IT WOULD JUST BE SO NICE
TO GET OFF AND JUST...

22:09.133 --> 22:13.500
STAND ON THE PLATFORM
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.433
LOOKS LIKE
I'M OFF THE TRAIN.

22:21.367 --> 22:23.267
OUR PARENTS DIED.

22:23.300 --> 22:27.133
WHEN A PARENT DIES,
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

22:27.167 --> 22:32.100
SO YOU MAKE A LOT OF
REALLY TERRIBLE DECISIONS...

22:32.133 --> 22:34.600
THAT YOU'RE GONNA END UP
HAVING TO LIVE WITH

22:34.633 --> 22:37.533
FOR A LONG TIME.

22:40.567 --> 22:42.067
YOU SHOULD GO.

22:42.067 --> 22:45.067
YOU ARE STILL ON THE TRAIN.

22:53.467 --> 22:55.067
IT'S OKAY.

22:55.067 --> 22:57.533
YOU HAVE TO GO.

22:57.567 --> 22:59.800
GO.

22:59.833 --> 23:03.667
GO. GO, GO.

23:14.300 --> 23:15.667
ADDISON.

23:15.700 --> 23:17.600
ADELE.

23:17.633 --> 23:20.467
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:20.500 --> 23:22.400
A FENDER BENDER. I'M FINE.

23:22.433 --> 23:26.467
I TOLD THE E.R. RESIDENT
I'M FINE, BUT...
ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA PAGE RICHARD.

23:26.500 --> 23:29.533
I'LL LET HIM KNOW
YOU'RE HERE.
OH, YOU WILL DO
NO SUCH THING, ADDISON.

23:29.567 --> 23:32.100
RICHARD CANNOT KNOW I'M HERE.
WE'RE SEPARATED.

23:32.133 --> 23:34.633
MY LIFE
IS NONE OF HIS BUSINESS.

23:34.667 --> 23:37.067
I'M SERIOUS.

23:38.533 --> 23:39.733
OKAY.

23:39.767 --> 23:41.533
UH, ALL RIGHT.

23:41.567 --> 23:43.467
WELL...
LET'S GET YOU CHECKED OUT.

23:43.500 --> 23:45.400
DO YOU HAVE ANY, UM,

23:45.433 --> 23:48.233
ANY PAIN, ANY...
ANYTHING?

23:48.267 --> 23:49.567
WELL... (chuckles)

23:49.600 --> 23:54.133
THERE'S ONE THING
I SHOULD PROBABLY MENTION.

23:54.167 --> 23:56.400
(whispers) I'M PREGNANT.

24:05.067 --> 24:06.800
THE BABY LOOKS FINE
ON THE ULTRASOUND,

24:06.833 --> 24:08.733
BUT YOU ARE SPOTTING
A LITTLE.

24:08.767 --> 24:09.833
IT'S NOTHING SEVERE,

24:09.867 --> 24:13.267
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO HOLD YOU
OVERNIGHT FOR OBSERVATION.

24:13.300 --> 24:15.200
OVERNIGHT? OH, NO.
I'M SORRY, BUT--

24:15.233 --> 24:18.067
FOR JUST A COUPLE OF HOURS
AT LEAST.

24:18.067 --> 24:19.400
LOOK, IT COULD BE NOTHING.

24:19.433 --> 24:21.367
BUT A PREGNANCY
AT YOUR AGE IS--

24:21.400 --> 24:24.067
TERRIFYING? EMBARRASSING?

24:24.067 --> 24:25.800
I WAS GOING TO SAY
A MIRACLE.

24:25.833 --> 24:28.433
I DON'T KNOW.
I RESIGNED MYSELF TO THE FACT

24:28.467 --> 24:31.067
A LONG TIME AGO
THAT I WOULD NEVER HAVE KIDS,

24:31.100 --> 24:33.733
AND HERE I AM, 52,
ABOUT TO BE DIVORCED

24:33.767 --> 24:35.200
AND PREGNANT.

24:35.233 --> 24:39.667
MAY I ASK WHO...
THE FATHER IS?

24:39.700 --> 24:41.367
YOU MAY ASK.

24:41.400 --> 24:44.267
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING
IS THAT IF RICHARD FINDS OUT

24:44.300 --> 24:46.233
THAT YOU'RE WALKING AROUND
THIS HOSPITAL

24:46.267 --> 24:48.200
CARRYING ANOTHER MAN'S BABY...

24:48.233 --> 24:50.133
RICHARD IS NOT
GOING TO FIND OUT

24:50.167 --> 24:53.733
BECAUSE NEITHER ONE OF US
ARE GOING TO TELL HIM.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.067
CHIEF.

25:02.100 --> 25:03.567
ADDISON.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.100
I JUST HEARD THE NEWS.
YOU--YOU HEARD?

25:06.133 --> 25:08.800
(sighs) WHO TOLD YOU?
WHAT--WHAT DID YOU HEAR?

25:08.833 --> 25:11.167
THAT JOE AND WALTER
ARE ADOPTING.

25:11.200 --> 25:14.067
IS THE BIRTH MOM HERE?
I'D LOVE TO PUT IN A GOOD WORD.
OH, NO, NO, NO.

25:14.100 --> 25:16.100
NO, NO, NO. CHIEF,
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO IN THERE.

25:16.133 --> 25:17.233
IT'S A YOUNG GIRL...

25:17.267 --> 25:21.200
IN THE STIRRUPS, YOU KNOW,
HER EQUIPMENT EXPOSED, RIGHT?

25:21.233 --> 25:23.133
YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT.

25:23.167 --> 25:25.167
NO, I-I DON'T WANT
TO SEE THAT.

25:27.233 --> 25:28.500
(sighs)

25:35.167 --> 25:39.067
ARE YOU GOING TO GIVE ME
AN INSPIRATIONAL SPEECH, TOO?

25:39.100 --> 25:40.700
NO.

25:46.600 --> 25:47.567
GEORGE.

25:47.600 --> 25:49.633
OH, I CAN'T TALK.
I HAVE A PATIENT TO PREP.

25:49.667 --> 25:52.067
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU AND ME.
THIS IS ABOUT MEREDITH.

25:52.100 --> 25:53.833
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
THERE'S NOTHING TO DO.

25:53.867 --> 25:57.067
WHAT?
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA BE HERE
IN A WEEK, SO...

25:57.100 --> 25:58.833
SO YOUR TRANSFERRING
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL

25:58.867 --> 26:01.567
MEANS WE'RE NOT
GONNA BE FRIENDS ANYMORE?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.733
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,
GEORGE?

26:03.767 --> 26:05.667
DIDN'T YOU HEAR A WORD
OF WHAT BAILEY SAID?

26:05.700 --> 26:07.600
(man) WHAT WERE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO, HMM,

26:07.633 --> 26:09.200
CARRY HIM
DOWN THE MOUNTAIN?

26:09.233 --> 26:11.500
(man) HE WAS OUR FRIEND,
AND WE LEFT HIM THERE.

26:11.533 --> 26:13.533
IF WE HADN'T,
WE'D BE DEAD, TOO.

26:13.567 --> 26:15.467
YOU KNOW THAT.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.367
DALE WAS RIGHT.

26:18.400 --> 26:21.500
YOU DON'T--
YOU DON'T DO THAT.

26:21.533 --> 26:24.500
YOU DON'T CLIMB
ALL THE WAY UP THERE TOGETHER

26:24.533 --> 26:27.067
JUST TO LEAVE A MAN BEHIND.

26:29.400 --> 26:31.500
I AM BEING STALKED
BY PREGNANT WOMEN.

26:31.533 --> 26:33.267
YOU'RE AN OBSTETRICIAN.
AND BARREN.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.167
YOU KNOW,
APPARENTLY AS A HEALTHY,

26:35.200 --> 26:38.067
SUCCESSFUL WOMAN IN HER 30s,
I DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE A BABY.

26:38.100 --> 26:40.167
MAYBE I'D HAVE
A FIGHTING CHANCE

26:40.200 --> 26:43.500
IF I WERE GAY OR A TEENAGER
OR A MEMBER OF THE A.A.R.P.

26:43.533 --> 26:45.833
MM. OH, THAT SUCKS.

26:45.867 --> 26:48.467
IT REALLY...

26:51.567 --> 26:54.267
NO. OH, NO, NOT YOU, TOO.

26:54.300 --> 26:56.667
OH, NO, NO, I'M NOT. I'M JUST--
I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.133
THAT'S ALL.
MM.

26:59.167 --> 27:01.500
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

27:01.533 --> 27:04.800
IT'S JUST THAT WITH GEORGE
GOING TO MERCY WEST NEXT YEAR...

27:04.833 --> 27:06.333
HE IS?

27:06.367 --> 27:08.267
YEAH, THEY HAVE
A SPOT FOR HIM,

27:08.300 --> 27:10.100
AND WE NEED A FRESH START.

27:10.133 --> 27:12.633
WE NEED TO GET AWAY
FROM ALL THIS CRAP.

27:12.667 --> 27:14.567
IT MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME.

27:14.600 --> 27:15.767
IT'S A GREAT TIME.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.467
DON'T LET ME

27:17.500 --> 27:20.067
AND MY FOSSILIZED EGGS
DISCOURAGE YOU.

27:20.067 --> 27:22.233
ARE WE GONNA BE FRIENDS STILL
IF I GET PREGNANT?

27:22.267 --> 27:24.400
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

27:31.700 --> 27:33.167
HI, CHIEF.

27:33.200 --> 27:35.333
O'MALLEY.

27:35.367 --> 27:37.833
FINALLY COMING TO SEE ME ABOUT
THAT LETTER FROM MERCY WEST?

27:37.867 --> 27:40.167
NO, SIR.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.400
I'M HERE ABOUT MEREDITH.

27:42.433 --> 27:45.233
***

27:45.267 --> 27:47.167
(Cristina) I HAVE TO SAY,
I DON'T GET IT.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.100
WHY WOULD ANYBODY
WASTE THEIR TIME

27:49.133 --> 27:51.600
FREEZING AND CLIMBING UP
THE SIDE OF A GLACIER?

27:51.633 --> 27:53.267
IT'S A WAY
TO TEST YOURSELF,

27:53.300 --> 27:55.200
YOU KNOW,
YOUR STRENGTH AND ENDURANCE.

27:55.233 --> 27:57.633
YOU PUT YOURSELF THROUGH
A SITUATION LIKE THAT,

27:57.667 --> 27:59.567
AND YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHO YOU ARE,

27:59.600 --> 28:01.667
WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF.

28:01.700 --> 28:05.067
HAVE YOU DONE IT BEFORE,
DR. BURKE?
NO. YOU?

28:05.100 --> 28:08.267
I USED TO, ALL THE TIME,
IN COLLEGE.
REALLY?

28:08.300 --> 28:10.333
(Cristina) REALLY?

28:10.367 --> 28:12.267
YEAH, IT'S, UH, INTENSE.
(chuckles)

28:12.300 --> 28:14.267
I MEAN, IT'S PAINFUL
AND HELLISH,

28:14.300 --> 28:16.200
AND YOU THINK
YOUR LUNGS ARE SHREDDING,

28:16.233 --> 28:18.200
BUT, MAN, WHEN YOU GET
TO THE TOP,

28:18.233 --> 28:19.567
THERE IS NOTHING LIKE IT.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.500
MAKES THE WHOLE CLIMB
WORTH IT.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.167
***

28:30.833 --> 28:32.733
***

28:32.767 --> 28:34.300
(Callie) HOW'S IT GOING?

28:34.333 --> 28:36.367
WORSE THAN I THOUGHT.
THERE'S NOTHING HERE.

28:36.400 --> 28:38.267
WE'RE GONNA AMPUTATE BOTH?
YOU CAN'T AMPUTATE
BOTH OF HIS HANDS.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.233
I-ISN'T THE LEFT HAND
LESS DAMAGED?

28:40.267 --> 28:42.167
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE
THE MAN'S HANDS, DR. STEVENS.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.100
ONCE THE INFECTION
GETS THAT DEEP,

28:44.133 --> 28:46.700
THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE HIS LIFE
IS TO MAKE THE CUT.

28:46.733 --> 28:48.567
***

28:48.600 --> 28:50.500
(Derek) THE PATIENT'S LAMINOTOMY
HAPPENS AT WHAT LEVEL,

28:50.533 --> 28:52.067
DR. O'MALLEY?

28:52.067 --> 28:54.133
THE LEVEL OF
MAXIMAL NEURAL COMPRESSIONS

28:54.167 --> 28:56.433
BETWEEN THE PEDICLES
OF THE FRACTURED VERTEBRAE.

28:56.467 --> 28:59.300
VERY GOOD. YOU MUST HAVE
ACED YOUR EXAM TODAY.

28:59.333 --> 29:01.300
(chuckles) I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ACED.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.667
HOW DID MEREDITH DO?

29:02.700 --> 29:05.400
YEAH, SHE WAS KINDA...

29:05.433 --> 29:08.400
DON'T WORRY, THOUGH.
I TALKED TO THE CHIEF.

29:08.433 --> 29:09.800
ABOUT WHAT?

29:09.833 --> 29:11.767
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

29:11.800 --> 29:14.133
***

29:16.867 --> 29:18.767
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S THE THING--

29:18.800 --> 29:20.300
THE SEATTLE
POLICE DEPARTMENT'S

29:20.333 --> 29:21.667
BEEN ON THIS FOR WEEKS.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.600
THEY'VE BEEN IN CONTACT
WITH MISSING PERSONS

29:23.633 --> 29:25.700
FROM ALL 50 STATES,
CANADA, THE FBI--
ALEX--

29:25.733 --> 29:28.433
YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE TRYING TO FIND YOU?

29:28.467 --> 29:29.800
YEAH, YES.
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU DO KNOW.

29:29.833 --> 29:31.700
YOU KNOW EXACTLY HOW MANY
RELATIVES YOU HAVE.

29:31.733 --> 29:33.767
YOU KNOW IF YOUR PARENTS
ARE DEAD OR ALIVE.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.533
YOU KNOW IF YOU'VE GOT A SISTER
SOMEWHERE WHO CRIES EVERY DAY

29:36.567 --> 29:38.300
BECAUSE SHE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU.
STOP IT.

29:38.333 --> 29:41.467
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S LIKE
FOR YOUR HUSBAND?
HE DIDN'T
COME LOOKING FOR ME, OKAY?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.833
HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T WANT
TO FIND ME.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.767
BESIDES, IT'S MY LIFE.
NO, NOT JUST YOURS.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.567
WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER?

29:47.600 --> 29:49.500
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT
GONNA LIE FOR YOU.

29:49.533 --> 29:52.367
IF YOU'RE NOT
GONNA TELL ANYBODY, I WILL.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

29:52.400 --> 29:53.600
YOU DON'T KNOW MY REAL NAME.

29:53.633 --> 29:56.267
YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.067
IT'LL BE
MY WORD AGAINST YOURS.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.300
YOU'RE RIGHT.

30:00.333 --> 30:03.033
I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NO IDEA WHO YOU ARE.

30:03.067 --> 30:06.733
***

30:09.867 --> 30:11.767
YOU PAGED ME?

30:11.800 --> 30:14.667
YEAH. UH, I THINK I FIGURED OUT
A WAY TO HELP MEREDITH.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.600
BUT I'VE GOT
SHEPHERD'S POST-OP, SO...

30:16.633 --> 30:18.467
I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

30:18.500 --> 30:20.667
AND I WON'T LEAVE THE PROGRAM

30:20.700 --> 30:24.067
WITHOUT, UH, KNOWING
THAT SHE'S STILL IN IT.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.200
***

30:26.233 --> 30:27.733
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING
THE PROGRAM.

30:27.767 --> 30:29.600
LISTEN...

30:29.633 --> 30:31.600
WE MADE A MISTAKE.

30:31.633 --> 30:32.800
WE HAD SEX.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.667
BUT THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

30:34.700 --> 30:38.033
I THINK WE BOTH WANTED IT
TO MEAN SOMETHING

30:38.067 --> 30:39.800
BECAUSE... YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO FEEL

30:39.833 --> 30:41.733
LIKE THAT GUY
THAT CHEATS ON HIS WIFE,

30:41.767 --> 30:44.233
AND I DIDN'T WANT TO
HAVE TO FEEL LIKE THAT GIRL

30:44.267 --> 30:46.533
WHO PUT YOU IN THAT POSITION
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

30:46.567 --> 30:49.200
BUT THE TRUTH IS...
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

30:49.233 --> 30:52.267
I KNOW YOU THINK
I HAVE FEELINGS FOR YOU,

30:52.300 --> 30:53.733
BUT I DON'T.

30:53.767 --> 30:56.633
SO YOU CAN STAY.

30:56.667 --> 30:58.833
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING
THE PROGRAM.

30:58.867 --> 31:02.300
***

31:09.867 --> 31:12.767
***

31:28.600 --> 31:30.600
(sobs)

31:32.400 --> 31:33.733
NICE WORK TODAY, TORRES.

31:33.767 --> 31:35.667
THREE SURGERIES
AT THE SAME TIME.

31:35.700 --> 31:37.600
I PERFORMED FOUR OSTEOSYNTHESES,
AMPUTATED TWO HANDS

31:37.633 --> 31:40.367
AND STABILIZED
ONE SPINE IN TWO HOURS.

31:40.400 --> 31:41.733
IMPRESSIVE.

31:41.767 --> 31:43.667
LOOKS LIKE BAILEY'S
NOT A SHOO-IN

31:43.700 --> 31:45.600
FOR CHIEF RESIDENT
AFTER ALL.

31:45.633 --> 31:47.067
HUH.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.800
UH, YOU'RE IN THE RUNNING
FOR CHIEF RESIDENT, TOO?

31:51.833 --> 31:53.600
YEAH.

31:53.633 --> 31:55.833
WHY WOULDN'T I BE?

31:55.867 --> 31:59.300
NO. UH, IT MAKES SENSE.
I JUST...

31:59.333 --> 32:02.133
I HADN'T THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
THAT'S ALL.

32:02.167 --> 32:03.833
I'M GOOD AT WHAT I DO,
BAILEY.

32:03.867 --> 32:06.100
I'M FOCUSED, I'M DISCIPLINED,

32:06.133 --> 32:09.367
I'M--I'M MORE THAN QUALIFIED
TO BE CHIEF RESIDENT.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.300
RIGHT.

32:11.333 --> 32:13.633
LOOK, WE ALL KNOW THAT
YOU'RE THE CHIEF'S FAVORITE,

32:13.667 --> 32:16.567
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T TAKE A SHOT.

32:18.533 --> 32:21.233
HERE SHE IS.

32:21.267 --> 32:22.067
(sighs)

32:22.067 --> 32:24.133
THANK YOU, STEVENS.
YOU CAN GO NOW.

32:24.167 --> 32:25.500
WE'LL BE WAITING
RIGHT OUTSIDE.

32:25.533 --> 32:27.067
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

32:27.067 --> 32:28.400
SHUT UP.

32:28.433 --> 32:29.767
(exhales)

32:29.800 --> 32:31.433
(clears throat)

32:33.267 --> 32:35.167
IF YOU CALLED ME HERE
TO LECTURE ME--

32:35.200 --> 32:38.067
THERE'S A COPY OF
THE INTERN'S EXAM ON THE TABLE,

32:38.100 --> 32:40.567
SOME NUMBER 2 PENCILS,
A BOTTLE OF WATER

32:40.600 --> 32:43.200
AND A SANDWICH
IF YOU GET HUNGRY.

32:43.233 --> 32:46.100
I'LL SEND A PROCTOR IN, AND I'LL
COME BACK IN A FEW HOURS

32:46.133 --> 32:49.200
AND CHECK ON YOU.

32:49.233 --> 32:51.267
YOU ARE NOT MY FATHER.

32:53.667 --> 32:56.067
I KNOW THAT.

33:13.300 --> 33:16.200
(sighs)

33:16.233 --> 33:18.267
I KNOW.

33:18.300 --> 33:21.500
(cries)

33:41.200 --> 33:43.100
WELL, AT LEAST TEST DAY
IS ALMOST OVER.

33:43.133 --> 33:44.467
SPEAK FOR YOURSELF.

33:44.500 --> 33:47.767
I'M GETTING MARRIED TOMORROW.

33:47.800 --> 33:49.767
(sighs)

33:56.533 --> 33:59.400
(laughter)

33:59.433 --> 34:00.767
(Derek) HEY.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.700
HEY. THIS IS WHAT
YOU INVITED ME TO?

34:02.733 --> 34:04.633
THIS IS
YOUR BIG BACHELOR PARTY?

34:04.667 --> 34:07.233
IT WAS LAST-MINUTE.
I NEEDED SOME WARM BODIES.

34:07.267 --> 34:09.367
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY I'M HERE.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.367
WHY AM I THE ONLY GIRL,
BY THE WAY?

34:11.400 --> 34:13.700
WHAT AM I, THE ENTERTAINMENT?
I AM NOT STRIPPING.

34:13.733 --> 34:16.433
THAT'S OKAY.
WE'VE SEEN IT ALREADY.
TRUE.

34:16.467 --> 34:18.100
I HAVEN'T.

34:18.133 --> 34:20.600
(laughs) YEAH, WELL, WHY DON'T
I BUY YOU A DRINK INSTEAD?

34:20.633 --> 34:22.833
FIRST ROUND'S ON ME.

34:22.867 --> 34:26.233
I'LL GIVE YOU A HAND
WITH THOSE.

34:26.267 --> 34:27.767
CRISTINA WRITE HER VOWS?

34:27.800 --> 34:29.700
I GUESS
I'LL FIND OUT TOMORROW.

34:29.733 --> 34:30.667
AH.

34:30.700 --> 34:32.767
HOW'S MEREDITH DOING?

34:32.800 --> 34:35.500
I HAVE NO IDEA.

34:35.533 --> 34:37.433
SHOULDN'T BE THIS DIFFICULT,
SHOULD IT?

34:37.467 --> 34:39.133
PROBABLY NOT.

34:39.167 --> 34:41.167
YEAH.

34:41.200 --> 34:42.367
THEN AGAIN...

34:42.400 --> 34:45.400
WHEN I SEE CRISTINA WALKING
DOWN THAT AISLE TOMORROW...

34:45.433 --> 34:47.700
IT'LL ALL BE WORTH IT?

34:47.733 --> 34:49.367
MM-HMM.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.533
***

34:59.267 --> 35:02.367
(clears throat)
SO HOW WAS L.A.?

35:02.400 --> 35:06.467
L.A. WAS... DIFFERENT.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.767
***

35:08.800 --> 35:12.767
LOOK, MARK...

35:12.800 --> 35:15.667
THINGS DON'T HAVE TO BE
AWKWARD BETWEEN US.

35:15.700 --> 35:17.667
WE TRIED.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.533
WE TRIED,
AND WE DID OUR BEST,

35:19.567 --> 35:22.433
AND JUST BECAUSE WE FAILED
AS A COUPLE, IT DOESN'T MEAN--

35:22.467 --> 35:24.267
I KNOW.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.533
SO WE'RE STILL FRIENDS?

35:26.567 --> 35:29.433
***

35:29.467 --> 35:31.067
WITH BENEFITS?

35:31.067 --> 35:33.733
(laughs) OH. DON'T PUSH IT.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.200
(chuckles)

35:36.233 --> 35:37.500
THANKS, JOE.

35:37.533 --> 35:38.567
YEP.

35:38.600 --> 35:40.500
SO HEY, HOW'D IT GO
WITH, UH, RINA?

35:40.533 --> 35:41.833
OH, WELL...

35:41.867 --> 35:43.767
WALTER TOOK HER
TO THE BUS STATION,

35:43.800 --> 35:46.333
AND I'M PRETTY SURE
HE WAS WISHING

35:46.367 --> 35:50.100
IT WAS ME
HE WAS DROPPING OFF.
OOH. THAT BAD, HUH?

35:50.133 --> 35:52.067
IF I CAN'T EVEN MAKE IT
THROUGH AN ULTRASOUND

35:52.067 --> 35:53.400
WITHOUT BREATHING
INTO A PAPER BAG,

35:53.433 --> 35:55.767
HOW AM I GONNA HANDLE A KID?
FORGET ABOUT TWINS.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.067
YOU TWO ARE GONNA MAKE
GREAT PARENTS, OKAY?

35:58.067 --> 35:59.800
WHENEVER THAT HAPPENS.

35:59.833 --> 36:02.667
YOU... EVER THINK ABOUT
HAVING KIDS?

36:02.700 --> 36:05.067
ALL THE TIME.

36:12.100 --> 36:13.200
ADELE?

36:14.533 --> 36:17.133
ADELE.

36:17.167 --> 36:19.733
ADELE!

36:19.767 --> 36:23.467
OH, COME ON.
I KNOW YOU SAW ME.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.100
NOW THIS IS JUST SILLY.

36:25.133 --> 36:28.300
YOU DON'T HAVE TO HIDE.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.700
I'VE MOVED ON.

36:30.733 --> 36:33.300
I'M DATING NOW.

36:33.333 --> 36:35.433
O-OKAY,
I'M NOT ACTUALLY DATING,

36:35.467 --> 36:38.467
BUT I INTEND TO...

36:38.500 --> 36:40.133
AT SOME POINT.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.100
WHAT THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO ABOUT THE STUPID VOWS?

36:45.133 --> 36:46.833
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
WRITTEN ANYTHING?
WELL, IT'S STUPID CRAP.

36:46.867 --> 36:49.067
NO, IT ISN'T.
WELL, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY?

36:49.067 --> 36:51.400
I SWEAR TO LOVE AND CHERISH YOU
EVERY MOMENT

36:51.433 --> 36:53.333
OF EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE?
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT REAL.

36:53.367 --> 36:55.200
I MEAN, THAT'S NOT
HOW IT WORKS, RIGHT?

36:55.233 --> 36:58.433
IT DOES, AT FIRST,
BUT THEN IT...
IT PASSES.

36:58.467 --> 37:01.467
NO, IT DOESN'T. YOU GUYS ARE
JUST USED TO IT. THAT'S ALL.

37:01.500 --> 37:04.667
YOU ALREADY HAVE IT. YOU HAVE
THAT THING EVERYBODY ELSE WANTS.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.267
YOU CAN TAKE IT FOR GRANTED.

37:06.300 --> 37:08.600
BUT LET ME TELL YOU,
IF YOU DIDN'T,

37:08.633 --> 37:11.567
IF YOU COULDN'T BE WITH
THE PERSON THAT YOU LOVE,

37:11.600 --> 37:14.833
I GUARANTEE THAT HEARING HIM
PROMISE TO LOVE YOU

37:14.867 --> 37:17.467
AND HONOR YOU AND CHERISH YOU,
NO MATTER WHAT,

37:17.500 --> 37:21.067
IT WOULD BE PRETTY MUCH
ALL YOU COULD THINK ABOUT.

37:24.567 --> 37:28.600
WAIT, CAN YOU SAY THAT AGAIN,
UH, JUST SLOWLY?

37:28.633 --> 37:31.267

37:31.300 --> 37:33.467
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT DENNY,

BAD DAY.
