00:01.074 --> 00:02.872
What's with this...
ZBZ mixer?

00:02.882 --> 00:06.884
Aren't they all about mixing with
 those KT losers this semester?

00:06.894 --> 00:10.098
I am starting to wonder. 
...if he's even the right guy for me.

00:10.108 --> 00:13.405
- Wow. You can really wear a suit.
- What're you doing?

00:13.415 --> 00:15.507
We said we'd come.  Not that we'd stay.

00:15.517 --> 00:18.190
Thanks again for paying
our electric bill.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.557
I may not have money, Trip,
but I am still your president.

00:21.567 --> 00:23.142
You may not be for long.

00:25.450 --> 00:26.554
- Dale, what're you doing?

00:26.564 --> 00:30.392
I saw you making all this progress
and realized that you're real competition.

00:30.402 --> 00:33.819
I've looked at you like a friend,
and you look down on me like The Anchor.

00:33.829 --> 00:34.503
Russ...

00:34.513 --> 00:37.662
Cap, I poured my heart out to you at the 
End of the World party,

00:37.672 --> 00:39.520
and you didn't come after me.

00:39.530 --> 00:40.855
But I'm here now.

01:07.562 --> 01:09.129
I'm feeling pretty cheap here.

01:09.139 --> 01:11.732
You were asleep, and I'm totally late.

01:11.742 --> 01:13.770
Ashleigh's gonna wonder where I slept.

01:13.780 --> 01:16.397
You know, it's killing me not telling her.

01:16.675 --> 01:18.041
It's only been a week.

01:18.051 --> 01:20.334
And it's been an amazing week.

01:25.188 --> 01:27.995
You can't keep putting this off.
You have to tell Evan.

01:28.005 --> 01:32.062
We both agreed he should know first 
and you said you'd handle it.

01:32.072 --> 01:34.177
It's just tough to get
any alone time with him.

01:34.187 --> 01:36.370
Someone's always
in the Amphora lair...

01:37.225 --> 01:38.839
...lighting torches...
...electing

01:39.517 --> 01:41.717
the next president...

01:44.832 --> 01:47.230
- Oops, I just broke the code.
- Come on, Cap.

01:51.060 --> 01:54.110
I'm just a little nervous because finally,

01:54.758 --> 01:56.558
after all this time,

01:56.914 --> 01:58.655
we're back to being
friends again.

01:59.419 --> 02:01.678
And you're worried
that friendship will fall apart

02:02.304 --> 02:04.072
when he learns we're together?

02:04.539 --> 02:08.670
Well, not to mention,he seemed
 pretty against it at the End of the World party.

02:10.646 --> 02:12.647
But this time we're gonna get it right.

02:13.471 --> 02:15.004
We're three years wiser.

02:20.985 --> 02:22.853
Maybe you're three years wiser.

02:23.231 --> 02:24.821
So you'll tell him?

02:24.922 --> 02:27.628
Absotely. I will e-Mail this morning.

02:27.638 --> 02:30.510
- Cap.
- All right, I'll text him. Or E-vite, inviting him

02:30.520 --> 02:31.967
to the conversation.

02:31.977 --> 02:35.318
Yesterday, Ash wanted to know
why I had this smile,

02:35.328 --> 02:37.591
and I couldn't think of
an excuse, so I told her

02:37.601 --> 02:39.966
I was thinking about the rise
and fall of Mischa Barton.

02:40.837 --> 02:44.393
 So you have to tell Evan now.
 Then we can pick this back up.

02:44.403 --> 02:46.252
- Pick what up?
- This.

02:59.113 --> 03:02.482
- Maybe I should go tell him now. Yeah.
- Then I can tell Ashleigh.

03:09.126 --> 03:10.401
Dale. We need to talk.

03:10.411 --> 03:14.061
Really?! We've done so well this past week 
not talking. 

03:14.259 --> 03:16.675
I need half your cable bill.
It's due today.

03:16.685 --> 03:17.710
Today?

03:17.720 --> 03:19.226
You could've told me a little 
sooner, you know?

03:19.236 --> 03:21.230
I wrote you a message
in my grant project notes.

03:21.240 --> 03:23.489
- I'm surprised you didn't see it.
-  For the love of...

03:23.499 --> 03:25.560
You know what?
I apologized for that already.

03:25.570 --> 03:28.098
Even though I don't think
I had anything to apologize for.

03:28.108 --> 03:32.392
 if this is you back with God,
I think I liked the godless Dale better.

03:32.402 --> 03:34.266
It'll all be moot when I win
the Innovation Grant today.

03:34.276 --> 03:36.268
When you win?
I have a shot, too.

03:36.278 --> 03:40.144
I've seen your notes. You still 
haven't gotten your wire to re-conduct.

03:40.418 --> 03:42.360
Actually, the same night...

03:43.979 --> 03:47.943
my self-healing wire turned
on for a full three minutes.

03:47.953 --> 03:50.453
- Three minutes?
- Just like your mother.

03:52.097 --> 03:55.210
All right, well, then I guess...
the better man will win.

03:56.790 --> 03:58.990
I think we both know
who that man is.

04:03.184 --> 04:04.184
It's me.

04:09.169 --> 04:12.294
Www.addic7ed.com

04:23.642 --> 04:27.586
I slink down Greek Row looking mighty fine

04:27.596 --> 04:30.868
Howling to the moonlight
on a hot winter night

04:30.878 --> 04:35.102
Singing the blues while the other girls cry...

04:35.112 --> 04:37.369
Stop marki and give it your all!

04:37.379 --> 04:39.592
SongFest is in two days!

04:40.592 --> 04:42.513
The drop-down is on the four!

04:42.523 --> 04:44.977
The four! Let's step through it again.

04:45.231 --> 04:49.101
Great job, Beth. The house is so lucky
to have a real Dance major.

04:49.111 --> 04:51.748
And I'm so lucky that it's me.

04:54.498 --> 04:56.359
Hey! Where were you last night?

04:56.369 --> 04:59.308
- Did you have a boy-girl sleep-over?
- Maybe.

04:59.318 --> 05:01.539
Who? The scruffy emo guy from the library?

05:01.549 --> 05:03.617
He's scruffy all right.

05:03.627 --> 05:06.065
And really awesome.
And someone you know.

05:06.520 --> 05:07.570
Are you ready?

05:08.031 --> 05:09.744
Cappie and I are back together.

05:09.754 --> 05:11.554
You got back together with Cappie?

05:15.687 --> 05:17.687
- Seriously?
- Who cares?

05:18.074 --> 05:20.061
Get your asses back in line!

05:20.071 --> 05:21.079
Now!

05:23.026 --> 05:24.582
Well, I guess it was inevitable.

05:24.592 --> 05:27.463
I want you to know I rarely try
to sleep with the same ex twice.

05:27.473 --> 05:28.673
Thanks, Becks.

05:29.034 --> 05:30.577
I'm... almost touched.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.780
Now go dance.

05:33.276 --> 05:34.276
And 

05:34.609 --> 05:36.839
five, six, seven, eight!

05:37.593 --> 05:38.593
Wow.

05:38.788 --> 05:40.978
Wow. That is just so...

05:42.795 --> 05:43.795
Wow.

05:43.937 --> 05:46.795
"Wow", good? "Wow", bad?

05:46.805 --> 05:48.492
"Wow" could mean a lot of things.

05:48.502 --> 05:52.349
No, I mean "wow", I hope you don't
disappear into the KT black hole.

05:52.359 --> 05:54.541
'Cause SongFest is the
second most Blue Ribbon

05:54.551 --> 05:56.045
points after Greek Week,

05:56.055 --> 05:59.231
- and you're one of our best dancers.
- I won't ditch you. I promise.

05:59.241 --> 06:00.219
Good. 

06:00.229 --> 06:03.122
Because we are on a mission to take
back number one from Gamma Psi,

06:03.132 --> 06:05.355
I don't want any distractions.

06:05.441 --> 06:06.441
Hang on.

06:07.307 --> 06:09.989
- Katherine texted me.
- What does she want?

06:09.999 --> 06:11.025
I don't know.

06:11.581 --> 06:15.512
But I know what I want: an apology for
what they did to us at the four-pack.

06:17.381 --> 06:19.141
Hey, Cap, what's the...

06:19.413 --> 06:20.513
urn-mergency?

06:23.330 --> 06:24.444
It's a good one.

06:25.239 --> 06:26.526
Wait, what's wrong?

06:26.624 --> 06:27.624
Well...

06:28.301 --> 06:31.852
Let me just start by saying that
your opinion means a lot to me.

06:32.015 --> 06:33.015
OK...

06:33.357 --> 06:34.736
You know that I value...

06:36.000 --> 06:37.000
 you.

06:37.010 --> 06:38.142
Am I getting fired?

06:38.152 --> 06:41.202
The opposite actually. Let's think of this as

06:41.274 --> 06:43.166
bringing another member into our team...

06:43.176 --> 06:44.537
...she'll be working

06:45.746 --> 06:47.478
directly under me...

06:47.488 --> 06:48.965
Cap, what're you talking about?

06:55.060 --> 06:58.058
Casey and I got back
together on Thanksgiving.

07:00.075 --> 07:01.696
Wow. OK.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.777
You waited all week to tell me?

07:03.787 --> 07:04.884
I was just 

07:04.894 --> 07:06.765
worried how you'd react.

07:06.775 --> 07:09.834
Why? You still think that
I have feelings for her?

07:09.844 --> 07:13.397
No. At the End of the World party
you told me not to go after her.

07:15.688 --> 07:17.385
Why, do you have feelings forer?

07:17.876 --> 07:20.781
No, no. We're just friends.
We're totally just friends.

07:20.791 --> 07:23.705
Man, you know what, I regret
saying what I said at the party.

07:23.715 --> 07:25.764
This is gonna be good. This
is gonna be really good.

07:25.774 --> 07:28.210
It's great. Nothing is gonna change.

07:28.220 --> 07:29.981
We'll all be pals, you know, like...

07:29.991 --> 07:31.288
...like Harry Potter...

07:31.666 --> 07:32.666
...and, um, you know,

07:33.562 --> 07:35.342
the other two.

07:35.352 --> 07:36.865
I appreciate that. Thank you.

07:36.875 --> 07:38.833
So... you're OK with it? Really?

07:38.843 --> 07:41.073
Yeah. Yeah, of course, man. Congrats.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.654
- Come on.
- Thanks.

07:43.735 --> 07:45.701
And... I'll catch you later, all right?

07:46.467 --> 07:48.633
You know, just tell Casey

07:48.701 --> 07:51.201
that I'll see her at Quidditch practice.

07:52.460 --> 07:54.271
- Another good one.
- You can stop.

07:54.281 --> 07:55.881
- I'm sorry.
- OK.

08:02.044 --> 08:03.965
Stop lollygagging, Cartwright.

08:03.975 --> 08:07.013
You don't need to be concerned with
your pasty, four-eyed friend. 

08:07.023 --> 08:08.768
The judges will be here any minute.

08:08.778 --> 08:10.076
OK. I'm almost done.

08:10.388 --> 08:12.899
You seem to be preoccupied
with your competition.

08:12.909 --> 08:14.435
Why don't you go speak to him?

08:14.445 --> 08:15.795
I got nothing to say to him.

08:15.805 --> 08:18.937
I'm not suggesting intelligent
discourse, Dale.

08:19.427 --> 08:22.707
If you think he's a threat,
go over and rattle his cage.

08:23.204 --> 08:26.276
Never underestimate the
value of the head game.

08:26.656 --> 08:27.656
Watch this.

08:28.195 --> 08:29.738
Looking good, Milton.

08:34.105 --> 08:35.150
See that?

08:35.481 --> 08:37.333
I don't know that that's necessary.

08:37.344 --> 08:38.828
You want to win, don't you?

08:38.839 --> 08:40.438
Be the best? Come on.

08:43.573 --> 08:44.685
Hey, Rus?

08:45.326 --> 08:47.192
Or should I say Anchor?

08:47.308 --> 08:48.960
That's a sweet light bulb.

08:48.970 --> 08:51.324
If I clap twice will it turn on?

08:52.261 --> 08:54.150
That's...a good one, Dale.

08:55.613 --> 08:57.500
What, you're not going to respond?

08:57.510 --> 08:58.836
You told me not to...

08:58.846 --> 09:01.240
He just fired a shot across your bow.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.934
In your people's vernacular, it's on!

09:03.944 --> 09:05.526
Show him what you've got.

09:07.309 --> 09:09.153
Hey, Dale, if I'm The Anchor,

09:09.163 --> 09:11.934
then you're the canker...

09:12.259 --> 09:13.923
sore... in my mouth.

09:13.933 --> 09:17.305
Oh! Anchor told Kettlewell he's
in his mouth! Good one, Ank.

09:19.977 --> 09:22.208
- Just gonna take that?
- Yeah, Rusty...

09:22.571 --> 09:25.425
I bet you do have canker sores...

09:26.309 --> 09:29.919
...from all the unsavory
women you've made out with.

09:30.623 --> 09:32.997
Oh! Point, Diz-ale! On a comebiz-ack!

09:33.551 --> 09:35.565
It's your turn. Make it count.

09:36.450 --> 09:39.662
At least I didn't lose my
virginity to our landlady,

09:39.672 --> 09:41.493
and then ask her to marry me.

09:41.503 --> 09:42.545
Oh, my God!

09:42.555 --> 09:44.476
I was doing right by her!

09:44.486 --> 09:46.090
You wanna have a conversation?!

09:46.966 --> 09:48.966
Time to focus.

10:07.338 --> 10:09.430
So, what are you up to tonight?

10:10.478 --> 10:13.129
Oh, I was thinking about
busting up some KTs.

10:13.935 --> 10:16.547
Oh, wait, that's probably you.

10:16.557 --> 10:17.587
OK, stop. 

10:18.007 --> 10:20.963
- Can we please put this behind us?
- You're the one who hasn't
wanted to talk about it.

10:20.973 --> 10:24.187
Talk about that I like looking
out for my house and brothers?

10:24.197 --> 10:28.072
OK, so you'll like looking out for them
but you don't want to be honest with them.

10:28.082 --> 10:31.206
- I knew this was about me coming out.
- It's not just about that.

10:31.216 --> 10:33.805
It's about this whole Mr. Tough Guy crap,

10:33.815 --> 10:37.376
how quick you were to turn on Evan, who,
by the way, is keeping your secret.

10:37.386 --> 10:40.354
And look at Evan: He came
out about his... money.

10:40.831 --> 10:43.647
Now everybody treats him
different. I don't want that.

10:43.657 --> 10:46.440
So maybe if I show them
that I'm a good brother...

10:46.884 --> 10:50.291
-...they'll take the news better.
- Grant, they're gonna take
the news the way they want to.

10:51.124 --> 10:53.199
If they have issues with it,
then that's their problem.

10:53.611 --> 10:57.387
There's a lot of better ways
to be a good brother

10:57.900 --> 10:59.534
- You don't understand.
- Grant...

11:00.354 --> 11:02.567
...I am the only one in
the house that does.

11:09.788 --> 11:13.265
It is simple, costumes revealing
genitals are unacceptable.

11:13.275 --> 11:16.549
If you read your SongFest handbook,
it's all spelled out in the rules.

11:16.878 --> 11:19.599
I cannot wait for the day when
I am paid to be this organized.

11:19.609 --> 11:21.663
I had to book vendors, organize security...

11:21.673 --> 11:24.312
Walk out on our four-pack
to make ZBZ look like losers.

11:24.322 --> 11:26.080
Is something bothering you, ZBZ?

11:26.370 --> 11:28.070
My name is Casey, 

11:28.375 --> 11:31.495
and yes something is bothering me.
You and your sisters screwed us.

11:31.505 --> 11:35.203
 four-pack, I don't concern myself
with inter-soritpolitics.

11:35.213 --> 11:38.238
You're a part of Gamma Psi. Your house 
went from girl scouts to the Real Housewives

11:38.248 --> 11:40.419
of pick-your-city overnight.

11:40.429 --> 11:43.071
Yes, but I'm also
Panhellenic President.

11:43.081 --> 11:47.111
People like us have to rise 
above the petty politics

11:47.121 --> 11:50.413
that exist between houses,
which I thought you could do.

11:50.770 --> 11:54.379
Which is why I wanted to speak with you.
As you kno there's an Vice President of Judicial.

11:56.511 --> 11:57.999
I want you to serve.

11:59.587 --> 12:03.283
- What!?
- You have good ideas, Casey, and drive.

12:03.589 --> 12:05.756
and I need a VP of Judicial who 
is not 

12:05.766 --> 12:08.235
afraid to disagree with me.

12:08.298 --> 12:10.104
I agree. But not all the time!

12:10.249 --> 12:12.948
I'm not afraid to disagree
with you when you're wrong.

12:12.958 --> 12:14.379
Which you are not, 

12:14.524 --> 12:15.629
currently.

12:16.887 --> 12:19.695
As VPJ you would oversee
Greek disciplinary action,

12:19.705 --> 12:22.022
you would help draft
new legislation.

12:22.121 --> 12:24.070
Yes, you get your ownlipboard.

12:24.080 --> 12:26.128
- My own clipboard?
- Just FYI. 

12:26.138 --> 12:28.659
Eighty-five percent of VPJs from CRU
go on 

12:28.669 --> 12:31.461
to receive JDs or MBAs.If that's something
that interests you?

12:31.471 --> 12:33.903
All of those letters
interest me a lot!

12:34.105 --> 12:37.276
as a Board member, you're
expected to be impartial, 

12:37.286 --> 12:40.385
so you can't  participate in
any inter-sorority competions.

12:40.395 --> 12:41.398
<i> So...</i>

12:42.131 --> 12:45.478
So I'd have to drop out
of ZBZ's SongFest skit?

12:45.950 --> 12:47.981
I need your answer by tomorrow. OK?

12:52.523 --> 12:53.524
That's good right there!

12:53.534 --> 12:56.620
I'm so happy my big brother
is dating my big sister.

12:56.630 --> 12:59.058
- You've waited a long time to say that, haven't you?
- Maybe.

13:00.665 --> 13:02.840
Don't worry. I know you're
her little brother, so...

13:02.850 --> 13:04.442
I'm not worried about her.

13:05.565 --> 13:07.316
How's your project going?

13:07.635 --> 13:09.787
I finished my presentation earlier,

13:10.678 --> 13:13.152
but Dale and I are still fighting
over  who's gonna win tonight.

13:13.162 --> 13:16.220
Yeah, Daley did  mention you
guys were having some problems

13:16.230 --> 13:17.564
this morning at Krav-Maga.

13:17.574 --> 13:18.640
Now listen...

13:19.471 --> 13:21.385
Every friendship has its rough patches.

13:21.395 --> 13:24.919
And if you're really friends you'll find a
 way to work it out in the End.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.264
Like Harry Potter...

13:26.803 --> 13:28.037
and those other two.

13:28.833 --> 13:30.129
OK. Holy crap, you guys,

13:30.393 --> 13:31.455
I'm graduating!

13:33.614 --> 13:34.741
What is that?

13:37.378 --> 13:39.085
- Crickets!
- Gross!

13:39.095 --> 13:40.135
I hate crickets!

13:40.145 --> 13:41.725
Ever sincePinocchio.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.635
They're too bossy.

13:45.229 --> 13:47.048
They're coming from the fireplace.

13:56.375 --> 13:59.932
"Enjoy your crickets, losers. XO OX"

13:59.942 --> 14:01.485
Wait. The Omega Chis pranked us?

14:01.495 --> 14:04.086
The old crickets-down-the-chimney gag.

14:04.096 --> 14:06.648
This has Evan Chambers
written all over it.

14:07.903 --> 14:10.609
Remember how I said everything
will work out in the end?

14:11.484 --> 14:12.919
Well, maybe I was wrong.

14:16.235 --> 14:17.267
How do I look?

14:17.799 --> 14:20.274
Like SongFest gold
and you know it.

14:21.263 --> 14:22.987
I do. Try yours on.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.966
First, I wanted... I wanted to talk 
to you about my meeting with Katherine.

14:27.976 --> 14:30.237
Tell me how it went.
Did you let her have it?

14:30.446 --> 14:33.586
Yes. I told her to stop calling
me ZBZ and call me Casey.

14:34.725 --> 14:35.731
Wow. And then what?

14:36.788 --> 14:40.686
And then she offered me a Panhellenic 
Board position. Wait, she offered you a job?

14:40.783 --> 14:43.001
Yeah, Vice President of Judicial.

14:43.358 --> 14:44.695
VPJ, yay!

14:48.135 --> 14:51.807
Which means I would have
to drop out of our skit.

14:52.705 --> 14:53.705
What?!

14:54.383 --> 14:56.236
It's a big opportunity!

14:56.620 --> 14:58.260
No, she's a Gamma Psi, Case.

14:58.270 --> 15:00.691
You went over there to chew her out
 and she bribed you!

15:00.701 --> 15:02.643
She did not bribe me, Ash.

15:02.653 --> 15:04.318
You are under a lot of pressure.

15:04.328 --> 15:06.913
You want to win SongFest...
Yeah. So did you.

15:07.618 --> 15:09.434
until Katherine came along.

15:13.812 --> 15:14.812
Crickets?

15:15.807 --> 15:16.879
Really, dude?

15:17.595 --> 15:18.820
You could've warned me.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.685
They're in every crack of our house.

15:22.719 --> 15:23.725
See?

15:23.978 --> 15:25.632
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:26.028 --> 15:27.425
I found this in our chimney,

15:27.632 --> 15:30.873
along with the entire cast of "A Bug's Life."

15:31.870 --> 15:33.995
You must've known what
your house was up to, right?

15:34.005 --> 15:37.714
Well, you did tag our plaque in
 your Thanksgiving break -in.

15:40.068 --> 15:41.373
 This is this about Casey, isn't it?

15:42.287 --> 15:43.819
- I knew this would happen.
- What?

15:43.829 --> 15:46.559
Things would get all weird
when you guys got back together.

15:46.569 --> 15:48.825
Since you're the one
making it weird, Nostradamus,

15:48.835 --> 15:51.394
I'm not exactly impressed by your 
ability to predict the future.

15:51.404 --> 15:52.615
I was just being honest.

15:52.625 --> 15:55.526
OK, Last time you were honest,
you ended up regretting what You said.

15:55.536 --> 15:57.385
I regret that I said that.

15:57.395 --> 16:00.279
OK? I don't understand why you want
to go through that again.

16:00.646 --> 16:02.761
You still don't think Casey and I will wk?

16:02.771 --> 16:04.362
Hey, I hope I'm wrong,

16:04.372 --> 16:06.192
- but given the history...
- Trust me,

16:06.738 --> 16:08.405
this time it will be different.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.207
Thank you all for participating.

16:22.217 --> 16:25.001
Your projects were amazing!

16:25.011 --> 16:28.224
Yes, yes, everyone gets a ribbon,
you're special just for trying...

16:28.234 --> 16:29.747
Announce the winners already.

16:31.487 --> 16:33.032
The finalists are...

16:35.703 --> 16:37.109
Samir Nagra...

16:37.119 --> 16:38.120
Yes!

16:38.285 --> 16:39.661
Kim Cervenka...

16:40.303 --> 16:42.453
- Li Yin Tan...
- Awesome!

16:42.463 --> 16:44.107
Dale Kettlewell...

16:44.117 --> 16:45.123
Yes!

16:45.184 --> 16:46.360
Was there any doubt?

16:47.823 --> 16:50.258
- ...and Rusty Cartwright.
- I did it?!

16:51.005 --> 16:52.195
I did it!

16:53.142 --> 16:54.720
Not bad, for The Anchor.

16:54.730 --> 16:57.132
Your final projects were all so good,

16:57.142 --> 17:00.811
that we need more time to
thoroughly evaluate each one.

17:01.215 --> 17:04.189
As a result, we'll announce
the winner next semester.

17:04.199 --> 17:05.980
Thank you all for coming.

17:09.954 --> 17:13.895
Hey, man, have you heard anything about
the guys dumping a boatload of crickets

17:13.905 --> 17:15.365
into the Kappa Tau chimney?

17:16.727 --> 17:18.380
I'm sure Grant knows.

17:19.255 --> 17:21.637
- Things still bad there?
- Yeah. And getting worse.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.337
Yeah, I know how you feel.

17:24.224 --> 17:26.271
Probably not entirely...

17:26.964 --> 17:28.013
...but, um, yeah, 

17:28.595 --> 17:30.847
a few of the guys are still
treating me weird.

17:30.857 --> 17:32.634
- Stand your ground.
- Yeah, you, too.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.128
Hey guys, 

17:34.428 --> 17:36.563
we're getting a poker game
started. Wanna join us?

17:38.455 --> 17:39.520
I'll pass.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.652
Yeah, Chambers. Hundred-dollar buy-in.

17:42.276 --> 17:43.642
Can you handle that?

17:43.778 --> 17:44.825
I'll pass.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.382
Actually, I'll stake you in this game.

17:48.392 --> 17:51.841
Consider it payback for all those
shots you've bought us in the past.

17:53.411 --> 17:54.731
Thanks, Grant.

17:56.536 --> 17:58.924
You guys gonna make out or play?

18:00.475 --> 18:01.681
I'm out.

18:04.394 --> 18:05.430
I'm in.

18:07.012 --> 18:08.035
Son of a...

18:08.571 --> 18:09.972
What the hell is this?!

18:10.441 --> 18:12.180
"You hit the...

18:12.314 --> 18:14.557
 KT wall."

18:17.652 --> 18:19.527
Krappa Tau is gonna pay for that.

18:22.578 --> 18:24.484
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

18:24.494 --> 18:25.686
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

18:25.696 --> 18:28.402
I've never seen so many Gamma
Psis together in one place.

18:28.630 --> 18:31.179
They look like those creepy little
kids from Village of the Damned.

18:31.189 --> 18:34.172
<i>Gamma Psi's the best and we got game </i>

18:34.990 --> 18:38.644
<i>So step back 
Boy, do not approach </i>

18:38.654 --> 18:39.700
They're good.

18:40.255 --> 18:42.188
They're good, but they're no ZBZ.

18:42.767 --> 18:45.692
I'd feel a lot better if
we had our entire cast.

18:46.006 --> 18:47.860
You guys are gonna do fine without me.

18:47.870 --> 18:49.520
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

18:49.921 --> 18:51.607
<i>Gamma Psi tonight</i>

18:53.525 --> 18:54.924
Gamma Psi.

18:57.748 --> 19:01.022
Hey, Case. I hope you guys are
ready for a little competion.

19:01.219 --> 19:04.806
I mean, the Mu Gamma Sigs might give
you guys a run for your money.

19:04.952 --> 19:05.965
Natalie, 

19:05.975 --> 19:10.425
shouldn't you be protecting
your pot of gold?

19:12.069 --> 19:16.011
Casey, that mean girl says
I can't do SongFest.

19:16.021 --> 19:17.264
What? Who?

19:17.934 --> 19:19.161
Katherine, 

19:19.171 --> 19:21.018
did you tell Beth that
she can't do SongFest?

19:21.028 --> 19:23.848
Afraid so. Participants have to be
current members of their ho

19:23.858 --> 19:27.197
Beth deactivated ZBZ last semester
when she went I-Kap, so...

19:27.765 --> 19:29.136
OK. I'll send her home.

19:29.146 --> 19:31.290
- What?
- Oh, you can't use her dance, either.

19:31.300 --> 19:32.415
- What? You can't be serious.
- What?

19:32.425 --> 19:35.462
As VPJ frontrunner,

19:35.472 --> 19:37.123
I think you should understand the rules.

19:37.133 --> 19:40.390
That just happen to knock us
out the day before SongFest.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.376
You just sabotaged our house,
you can't expect her...

19:42.386 --> 19:45.223
I don't have your response
on the VP of Judicial job.

19:45.233 --> 19:48.422
I really stuck my neck out for you,
so I'd like your answer now... 

19:48.432 --> 19:49.442
please.

19:53.530 --> 19:54.725
I decline.

19:56.850 --> 19:58.403
So you're gonna

19:58.955 --> 20:01.798
turn this down so you can dance
in a skit that you don't have?

20:01.808 --> 20:03.518
My house needs me.

20:03.528 --> 20:05.155
My house needs me.

20:05.415 --> 20:06.561
Moving on.

20:16.847 --> 20:19.214
to be one of those couples
that holds hands?

20:19.224 --> 20:21.009
I don't know. Let me see your hand.

20:22.164 --> 20:23.772
So how did Evan take it?

20:25.374 --> 20:27.322
Pretty well. You know Evs.

20:27.332 --> 20:29.731
Did Ashleigh explode over the news?

20:29.952 --> 20:33.774
Yeah, she was a little worried that
you'd pull my focus from SongFest.

20:33.784 --> 20:36.407
Obviously not. I missed you last night.

20:36.522 --> 20:40.371
We were up until four a.m. trying
to come up with a new dance.

20:41.430 --> 20:44.422
And all we agreed on was that
Katherine is another Frannie,

20:44.432 --> 20:47.560
- only evil-er.
- So tonight's out of the question?

20:47.570 --> 20:50.429
After SongFest is over, I promise.

20:52.884 --> 20:55.328
- Think you can wait that long?
- Oh, ok. 

20:55.561 --> 20:57.956
But any longer and I'm
gonna start without you.

20:59.013 --> 21:02.360
- Wow, sweaty much?
- Ok, that is you!

21:02.370 --> 21:03.370
Cap!

21:04.294 --> 21:05.658
Oh... Evan, hey.

21:05.668 --> 21:09.359
Hey, Case... do you mind if I talk
to Cap alone for a few sec?

21:09.705 --> 21:11.857
- What is going on?
- Why don't you ask him?

21:12.032 --> 21:14.959
He walled in our front door cause
he didn't appreciated my honesty

21:14.969 --> 21:17.389
This has nothing to do with your honesty.

21:17.680 --> 21:20.374
It's about the swarm of crickets
that's still in our house.

21:20.384 --> 21:23.634
Ok you guys, you can't let your houses
get in the way of your friendship.

21:23.644 --> 21:26.600
And until you get them to declare a
truce, none of this will ever change. 

21:26.610 --> 21:29.613
- Katie is a stowing up on this.
- Crickets, Evan.

21:34.023 --> 21:35.088
Douchebag.

21:42.148 --> 21:45.559
Maybe... what you guys need
is a common ennemy.

21:46.116 --> 21:48.661
Cappie. Who did the Kappa
Tau hate the most?

21:48.773 --> 21:49.989
Ryan Seacrest.

21:50.354 --> 21:52.098
Oh, no, no, no, wait... wait...

21:52.108 --> 21:53.111
Officer Huck.

21:53.121 --> 21:55.758
And who did the Omega Chis hate the most?

21:55.768 --> 21:56.862
Liberals?

21:57.199 --> 21:58.577
- Huck.
- So...

21:58.768 --> 21:59.828
maybe...

22:00.385 --> 22:02.397
we got our houses to team up against him.

22:02.407 --> 22:04.446
Fight over our hatred for Huck together.

22:05.466 --> 22:06.488
Right?

22:08.204 --> 22:11.534
Hey! So I thought we could celebrate
the end of this ridiculous competition

22:11.544 --> 22:13.950
between you to, with a .... pizza.

22:14.598 --> 22:16.121
So? Who won?

22:16.131 --> 22:19.579
- They haven't decided yet.
So neither of us won.
- Well, not yet anyway...

22:19.984 --> 22:21.815
- Hey!
- You're not gonna eat out.

22:21.825 --> 22:23.214
Guys, what the hell?

22:23.224 --> 22:25.995
- He keeps rubbing me the wrong way.
- Is there a right way to rub you?

22:26.005 --> 22:29.444
- Ok, this is ridiculous.
- Well, we need to do something soon.

22:29.454 --> 22:31.659
Because if I have to live like
this until next semester,

22:31.669 --> 22:34.857
- What? You're gonna take me down?
- Oh, I can take you up and down.

22:35.776 --> 22:38.589
- Well, there's only one
way to settle this then.
- Whoa, guys.

22:38.760 --> 22:39.809
And what's that?

22:40.722 --> 22:41.880
Battle Bots.

22:42.093 --> 22:43.390
- You're on.
- You're on.

22:47.276 --> 22:49.147
Wait... how about this?

22:52.419 --> 22:54.105
I just saw someone on the dancefloor once.

22:56.821 --> 22:58.854
That's fine if you wanna get pregnant.

23:00.308 --> 23:01.854
How about this?

23:08.958 --> 23:10.008
Really?

23:11.692 --> 23:13.491
You know, I never thought I'd say this...

23:13.501 --> 23:15.224
but without Beth, we're screwed.

23:16.055 --> 23:17.851
But we can't let Katherine win.

23:17.861 --> 23:20.675
We just have to be the best we
can be with the people we have.

23:20.772 --> 23:23.730
You know what, it's just too bad we
don't have someone who can choreograph.

23:23.740 --> 23:27.525
Oh, for the billionth time Abby, you don't
have to raise your hand to ask a question.

23:27.887 --> 23:30.465
It's more of a suggestion
actually. For a new dance.

23:30.475 --> 23:33.518
No offense, but what do you
know about choreography?

23:33.528 --> 23:35.872
I choreographed three of
my high school musicals,

23:35.882 --> 23:37.898
the third one, was our senior year.

23:40.741 --> 23:42.048
Oh, well we are desperate.

23:42.392 --> 23:44.267
And we're all in this together.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.721
So...

23:49.160 --> 23:50.256
What you doing Spitter?

23:50.394 --> 23:55.322
I have 24 hours to modify a base-line robot
with standardize weaponry to destroy Dale?

23:56.501 --> 23:57.513
Ok.

23:58.553 --> 24:00.887
Gemini wants you to be
careful with your killer robot. 

24:00.897 --> 24:02.148
Who's Gemini?

24:05.961 --> 24:07.999
We came to an understanding.

24:19.587 --> 24:22.037
- An official meeting now?
- No, sorry, I was just...

24:22.047 --> 24:24.192
killing a cricket. But I
do have an annoucement.

24:24.202 --> 24:26.612
We're gonna finally get
back at Officer Huck.

24:26.919 --> 24:30.140
Rusty has a killer-robot, so maybe
after he kills Dale, we can like...

24:30.150 --> 24:32.808
- attack Huck with it or something.
- We're not gonna need the robot Beav.

24:33.318 --> 24:35.173
We have help this time.

24:35.470 --> 24:36.650
The Omega Chis.

24:41.315 --> 24:43.108
- Cap, are you drunk?
- Nope, I'm serious.

24:43.118 --> 24:44.308
I talmked to Evan,

24:44.318 --> 24:46.153
our houses are gonna pull
off the plan together.

24:46.163 --> 24:49.000
- Why? Those guys are jerk.
- It's not like we can trust them.

24:50.154 --> 24:51.989
Gemini agrees with Rusty.

24:51.999 --> 24:53.445
True, but...

24:53.870 --> 24:55.753
what better way not to trust someone

24:55.763 --> 24:59.005
that to trust them with someone
you distrust more than them?

25:02.186 --> 25:03.580
That makes no sense at all.

25:03.590 --> 25:05.198
- Exactly.
- It works for me.

25:05.677 --> 25:06.943
Me too.

25:07.616 --> 25:08.796
Oh, Gemini!

25:11.984 --> 25:13.610
Great. Meeting adjourned.

25:18.862 --> 25:19.881
Nailed it.

25:23.313 --> 25:25.880
And so with KT's help we'll
pull off the ultime prank.

25:25.890 --> 25:29.257
And Huck and the school will
remember for years to come.

25:31.636 --> 25:34.100
Why do we wanna do anything with the KTs?

25:34.110 --> 25:36.325
Yeah, we don't need them
to screw with Huck.

25:36.335 --> 25:40.178
- Huh, that's true, but... I think...
- Was this your idea or them?

25:40.377 --> 25:41.791
We came up with this together.

25:42.836 --> 25:44.049
Come on, Chambers.

25:44.101 --> 25:46.138
Guys, just back off, alright?

25:46.148 --> 25:49.087
You guys have been on Evan's ass
ever since he gave up his money.

25:49.097 --> 25:50.745
This has nothing to do with money.

25:50.755 --> 25:54.059
It's about Evan being who he was
before he gave up his money.

25:54.243 --> 25:56.583
And I'm still that guy.

25:56.593 --> 25:59.906
The Evan Chambers we elected as president 
wouldn't have taken the back seat to anyone. 

25:59.916 --> 26:01.074
He's right, Evan.

26:01.503 --> 26:02.504
I'm sorry.

26:02.514 --> 26:06.713
The Evan Chambers I voted for
wouldn't join someone's else plan.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.403
He'd have one of his own.

26:09.126 --> 26:11.448
We need a prank that
shows how awesome we are.

26:11.458 --> 26:13.701
Or maybe we'd just need another president.

26:20.341 --> 26:21.594
Meeting adjourned.

26:38.238 --> 26:39.489
Thank you Pi

26:39.499 --> 26:43.257
for that wildly inappropriate
rendition of "Wild Things".

26:48.748 --> 26:50.826
Next up, we have ZBZ.

26:57.670 --> 26:59.761
This is it Beav, Casey's up.

26:59.827 --> 27:02.057
Maybe she and her buckle will do "Bound".

27:02.067 --> 27:03.399
Can't say I haven't thought about it.

27:03.409 --> 27:04.409
ZBZ!

27:04.621 --> 27:06.185
What is taking so long?

27:08.141 --> 27:09.141
ZBZ!

27:14.715 --> 27:17.786
Well, I guess this means ZBZ
is not coming. Moving on.

29:00.633 --> 29:01.910
Yo Casey!

29:29.269 --> 29:30.836
Teach me, teach me, teach me!

29:30.846 --> 29:33.642
So what, do I start dancing like
right here flesh mob style?

29:33.652 --> 29:35.939
- Ok, no, honey...
- What? Sorry.

29:36.172 --> 29:38.950
Case, we're waiting for the results.

29:48.446 --> 29:49.891
Ash, wow.

29:50.046 --> 29:51.389
Who's that girl?

29:51.846 --> 29:53.781
Oh... she's a friend.

29:54.117 --> 29:57.011
Congratulations, you were so so great.

29:57.276 --> 29:58.282
Thanks.

30:01.205 --> 30:03.034
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Ok.

30:05.895 --> 30:08.005
- So I'm in.
- Well, that means we're both in.

30:08.320 --> 30:09.981
We're waiting further.

30:10.273 --> 30:12.425
Do you have any idea what
comes ou of your mouth?

30:12.435 --> 30:13.903
- No, do you?
- Guys.

30:14.951 --> 30:16.653
We'll meet later at the students' union.

30:16.784 --> 30:17.800
All right.

30:21.636 --> 30:22.985
Hey, richkin.

30:22.995 --> 30:25.445
Wanna grab a drink at Dobler's afterwards?

30:25.715 --> 30:28.909
Oh, sorry I gotta raincheck, but
you looked pretty awesome up there.

30:29.115 --> 30:30.115
I know.

30:37.615 --> 30:39.878
The scores are in.

30:40.068 --> 30:44.293
The winner of this year SongFest,
and "15 blue" event points

30:44.568 --> 30:45.603
is

30:51.512 --> 30:53.242
Gamma Psi!

31:00.455 --> 31:01.507
What?

31:01.659 --> 31:02.687
What?

31:02.697 --> 31:05.253
We were way better than
these demonic munchkins.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.777
They cheated, they had to.

31:06.787 --> 31:08.533
Katherine tailed the votes.

31:08.543 --> 31:10.352
Maybe we should temper with them...

31:10.362 --> 31:13.859
Yeah, well, even if she did, we
can't prove it, so we're screwed. 

31:14.600 --> 31:17.182
All we need to do is... is
check the score sheets...

31:17.192 --> 31:18.808
which would be on her clipboard.

31:18.818 --> 31:21.059
So we're gonna ask to see her clipboard? 

31:21.217 --> 31:22.953
We don't have to ask.

31:30.015 --> 31:32.357
I guess this is it. No professors...

31:33.112 --> 31:34.535
no projects...

31:34.691 --> 31:35.983
just you and me.

31:36.130 --> 31:37.319
It had to be.

31:37.761 --> 31:40.221
Articulated hydraulic, mano a mano.

31:41.407 --> 31:42.966
Well, here's a fair fight.

31:44.357 --> 31:47.791
There's nothing fait about this Rust
Fair would be me winning my grand.

31:47.801 --> 31:51.686
Because for the last year and a half I'v
spent every waking minute on school.

31:51.696 --> 31:54.871
While you've been out with
your girls and your frat bros.

31:54.881 --> 31:57.802
Hey guys, save it for the Battle Bots.

31:57.812 --> 32:01.899
No, no. 'Cause I sacrifize
and I make the hard choices

32:01.909 --> 32:03.686
while everything just fall in your lap.

32:03.696 --> 32:06.781
You had a D on your midterm, you
almost flake on the extra credit, 

32:06.791 --> 32:08.372
and everything just works out.

32:08.382 --> 32:10.206
Hey, I worked hard too!

32:10.216 --> 32:12.932
Not half as hard as I have.
And you know it. 

32:13.387 --> 32:14.625
I deserve this.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.625
You don't.

32:19.319 --> 32:20.616
Can you believe it?

32:21.368 --> 32:22.368
Well,

32:23.141 --> 32:25.444
Rusty, all seems good for you,

32:25.454 --> 32:27.993
you know, school, Kappa
Tau, girlfriends...

32:28.220 --> 32:29.761
all he has is science.

32:29.771 --> 32:32.646
And, God, we barely talked this semester.

32:32.656 --> 32:35.111
So I just should let him win
because I feel bad for him?

32:35.121 --> 32:38.080
No, I'm just saying, this
guy has one thing in his life

32:38.090 --> 32:39.650
take that away from him...

32:40.137 --> 32:42.587
You're a scientist, you can do the math.

32:49.863 --> 32:53.463
Good thing they didn't leave a single light
on since we're paying their electric bill.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.864
Found a candle.

33:02.832 --> 33:03.841
Jasmine.

33:06.830 --> 33:08.241
What? It's dark in here.

33:08.251 --> 33:10.263
That's why we brought our flashlights.

33:11.103 --> 33:13.745
I think they were in a rush to hit
Dobler's. Everyone, start looki

33:20.641 --> 33:22.595
- Ooh! I think I found it!
- Let's see it.

33:23.841 --> 33:27.510
OK, the judges gave us
95, 95, 99, and a zero?

33:27.597 --> 33:30.747
- Someone gave us a zero out of 100?
- This one judge. Ryan.

33:31.164 --> 33:33.677
He also gave the Gamma Psis a 100!

33:33.963 --> 33:34.988
That's so shady!

33:34.998 --> 33:38.071
Yeah, all the others gave
Gamma Psi low 80S.

33:38.994 --> 33:40.985
Does that mean they bribed the judge?

33:41.188 --> 33:43.208
Oh! They're like mini-Sopranos.

33:43.218 --> 33:44.948
Well, if that's the case,

33:44.958 --> 33:46.430
then we have our proof.

33:46.808 --> 33:47.958
Yeah, let's go.

33:56.575 --> 33:57.575
Come on.

34:10.217 --> 34:11.710
We were right, Lambers.

34:11.721 --> 34:13.154
This is the ultimate prank.

34:13.164 --> 34:15.956
Let's go downstairs, get some
extra rope just to be safe.

34:15.967 --> 34:17.300
- Cap, come on.
- Sure. 

34:17.789 --> 34:20.170
- Guys, you good for a sec?
- Got it, Cap.

34:32.876 --> 34:33.879
Guys!

34:41.107 --> 34:42.226
Evan, get in.

34:42.235 --> 34:44.109
You guys are bailing?

34:44.597 --> 34:47.333
- Run, Cap.
- We're not even done here.
What're you talking about?

34:47.784 --> 34:48.969
Evan, hurry.

34:49.304 --> 34:51.271
Guys! We can't hold this forever!

34:51.281 --> 34:54.148
- They need our help up there.
- Get in the truck. All right.

34:56.456 --> 34:57.903
- You called the cops!
- Sorry, Cap.

34:57.913 --> 34:59.695
Listen to me, I'm doing you a favor. 

35:00.005 --> 35:01.014
Run!

35:01.024 --> 35:02.039
But, wait...

35:04.206 --> 35:05.304
Oh, no, no, no!

35:08.472 --> 35:09.595
Oh, my God!

35:15.137 --> 35:16.869
Sweet mother of mercy.

35:17.499 --> 35:18.812
The Mach 5!

35:18.822 --> 35:20.959
- We gotta go.
- What? Where are Wade and the guys?

35:20.969 --> 35:23.220
- We can't help.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

35:24.311 --> 35:27.026
Oh, dear lord, that's a sticky wicket.

35:29.176 --> 35:30.424
Don't move!

35:32.120 --> 35:33.379
They went that-a-way!

35:37.597 --> 35:41.730
In this corner, standing

35:41.740 --> 35:43.890
a member of a non-academic frat,

35:43.900 --> 35:47.017
It's Rusty "The Anchor" Cartwright!

35:47.232 --> 35:50.151
In this corner, he's a born
-again landlady lay-er

35:50.161 --> 35:51.708
from Wetumpka, Arkansas,

35:51.876 --> 35:53.819
weighing at he-wouldn't-tell-us,

35:53.829 --> 35:58.645
the ultimate, extreme circuit boarder,
Dale "The Lightning Rail" Kettlewell.

35:58.949 --> 36:00.844
Please let this be quick.

36:01.171 --> 36:02.471
On your marks, 

36:03.133 --> 36:04.164
get set...

36:06.515 --> 36:07.784
...Battle Bots!

36:26.145 --> 36:27.686
Close shave, huh, Rus?!

36:30.499 --> 36:31.499
Yeah!

36:47.091 --> 36:48.782
Anchor's away, Dale!

36:52.952 --> 36:54.224
How does that feel?

36:58.928 --> 37:00.171
What's wrong, Dale?

37:01.831 --> 37:03.233
What's wrong with your robot?

37:05.986 --> 37:07.876
This guy's gonna lose to Rusty!

37:07.886 --> 37:09.965
Looks like we got ourselves a new Anchor!

37:15.644 --> 37:17.267
No, no, no, no...

37:39.823 --> 37:40.969
Dale wins!

37:44.374 --> 37:46.162
Dale wins, everybody!

37:51.337 --> 37:52.709
Congratulations, Dale.

37:53.683 --> 37:56.902
Thanks, Rusty. Looks like we finally
found out who the better man is.

38:01.861 --> 38:04.570
- Dale! Dale! Dale! Dale!
- Ok...

38:04.580 --> 38:06.118
Dale! Dale!

38:12.712 --> 38:15.281
Smells like someone's grilling.

38:15.291 --> 38:16.542
I really hope not.

38:17.789 --> 38:20.322
Rebecca, did you remember
to blow out that candle?

38:22.147 --> 38:23.302
Guys...

38:23.568 --> 38:24.853
Back at the house.

38:36.413 --> 38:37.555
We need to talk.

38:39.768 --> 38:41.913
Outside. I don't want you in my house.

38:51.460 --> 38:53.472
I'm glad you made it out OK...

38:53.907 --> 38:55.375
You planned this?

38:55.745 --> 38:56.925
Listen to me, all right?

38:56.935 --> 38:59.675
Yes, we left your guys holding
the cart and called the police.

38:59.685 --> 39:00.948
So we'd get caught.

39:01.059 --> 39:03.055
I had to do it to get my house back.

39:03.065 --> 39:05.984
And your solution was to get
three of my brothers expelled.

39:07.784 --> 39:09.023
Expelled? 

39:09.674 --> 39:11.482
God, no, that wasn't the plan.

39:11.492 --> 39:13.412
We thought they'd get community service.

39:13.422 --> 39:16.356
- That's a hell of a plan.
- What was I supposed to do, man?!

39:16.719 --> 39:20.617
Give up my house and take a backseat to
you and Casey like I did. Freshman year? 

39:20.820 --> 39:21.838
Come on!

39:23.871 --> 39:26.124
When it comes down to
choosing between friends 

39:26.134 --> 39:28.831
and brothers, you have to
choose your brothers.

39:32.661 --> 39:33.662
Yeah,

39:34.511 --> 39:36.289
you made your choice pretty clear.

39:37.223 --> 39:39.124
Wait. Listen. Listen.

39:41.951 --> 39:43.439
You have the perfect girl,

39:44.609 --> 39:46.509
guys who worship you.

39:47.825 --> 39:49.736
My house is all I have left.

39:51.686 --> 39:53.223
Well, you're right about that.

39:56.993 --> 39:59.794
Oh, and if I were you, I would
go out through the back gate.

40:12.457 --> 40:13.709
What happened?

40:21.133 --> 40:23.483
Oh! Thank God you guys are OK.
When we heard the sirens

40:23.493 --> 40:26.294
I thought maybe you guys
were in the Gamma Psi house.

40:27.661 --> 40:29.937
- We weren't there.
- Thank God,

40:29.947 --> 40:33.086
for a second there I thought that
maybe you guys had started the fire.

40:33.096 --> 40:34.328
No, we were there,

40:34.695 --> 40:36.541
but we didn't start the fire.

40:37.229 --> 40:38.506
We hope not.

40:39.694 --> 40:41.875
I left a candle burning, not a campfire!

40:41.885 --> 40:45.686
But, maybe you can explain that to the
police since you love talking about it.

40:46.095 --> 40:47.558
Oh, my God! The police?

40:48.703 --> 40:52.416
We're all gonna go to girl jail like
those prison movies my boyfriend watches!

40:56.513 --> 40:59.303
- It's Katherine!
- Oh, no. That's the mean girl.

40:59.687 --> 41:01.032
OK, I got it.

41:04.409 --> 41:05.431
Katherine,

41:05.833 --> 41:08.174
- I can't believe this.
- I know. It is surreal. 

41:09.557 --> 41:13.149
But I plan on doing everything in
my power to investigate this.

41:13.888 --> 41:16.601
Is that necessary? It
could've been an accident.

41:16.612 --> 41:20.493
No, it's unlikely. This is the kind of thing
that rarely occurs unless someone is at fault.

41:20.504 --> 41:22.689
And they will be punished severely.

41:22.809 --> 41:25.152
You should go easy, I mean...

41:25.162 --> 41:27.600
You don't want to
overdo it, you know... 

41:28.367 --> 41:29.407
right?

41:31.266 --> 41:33.624
That's big of you, Casey, considering 

41:33.634 --> 41:35.904
ZBZ is  the most affected.

41:36.971 --> 41:37.976
Wait. 

41:37.986 --> 41:39.176
What are you talking about?

41:39.186 --> 41:42.664
Irregularities in SongFest judging.
What are you talking about?

41:47.437 --> 41:49.518
I was talking about
your house burning down.

41:49.983 --> 41:51.092
My what?!

41:52.167 --> 41:53.300
Oh, my God!

41:54.409 --> 41:56.919
She didn't disqualify Beth
for no reason! She...

41:57.259 --> 42:00.645
Which means she really wanted me for the
job. Which means she's not Frannie.

42:00.655 --> 42:02.641
We have bigger problems.

42:03.168 --> 42:04.808
You're our president, Ash.

42:05.591 --> 42:06.651
What now?

42:11.899 --> 42:13.848
We turn ourselves in, I guess.

42:17.510 --> 42:19.206
- No.
- No?

42:19.629 --> 42:23.186
We can't turn ourselves in because
we don't know what happened.

42:23.196 --> 42:26.318
It's an old house. It could've been
electrical, it could've been a gas leak...

42:26.328 --> 42:28.347
- Or a raccoon.

42:28.357 --> 42:30.564
We'll know if we did it

42:30.898 --> 42:32.758
when we get in trouble for it.

42:32.768 --> 42:34.791
But until then we say nothing.

42:36.209 --> 42:38.072
- I won't breath a word, I promise.
- Yeah.

42:38.082 --> 42:40.024
We all need to promise.
We need to make a pact.

42:40.034 --> 42:41.982
Yeah. Yeah, everyone gather around.

42:42.507 --> 42:43.857
Put your pinkies up.

42:48.351 --> 42:50.674
We, the sisters of Zeta Beta Zeta,

42:51.245 --> 42:54.385
promise never to tell anyone
outside of these walls

42:54.525 --> 42:56.240
what happened tonight.

42:56.484 --> 42:57.484
Yeah.

43:02.357 --> 43:03.373
Ok.

43:17.567 --> 43:18.800
What are you doing here?

43:20.137 --> 43:22.115
Rain check, remember?

43:24.327 --> 43:26.699
I could really use a friend right now.

43:43.835 --> 43:47.332
I can't believe Wade, Ferret
and Jeremy got expelled.

43:52.309 --> 43:54.653
I lost four of my best friends today.

43:58.096 --> 43:59.324
Sorry, Cap.

44:04.206 --> 44:05.641
Well, it could be worse.

44:07.442 --> 44:10.835
At least our house didn't burn
down like the Gamma Psi's, huh?

44:11.667 --> 44:12.667
Yeah.

44:14.315 --> 44:17.310
