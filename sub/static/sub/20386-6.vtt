00:26.860 --> 00:28.750
(There's a mysterious
woman in the kitchen.)

00:28.800 --> 00:30.630
How do you know she's mysterious?

00:30.680 --> 00:32.960
What? I don't know who she is.

00:33.040 --> 00:35.430
There's a mysterious woman in the kitchen.

00:35.480 --> 00:37.080
Well, ask her who she is.

00:43.400 --> 00:44.330
Er, erm...

00:45.080 --> 00:46.790
Good morning.

00:46.840 --> 00:50.630
Hallo, I am the daughter of Mrs Mavrona.

00:50.680 --> 00:52.630
Oh, how super.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.630
Oh, Lugaretzia.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.430
Her back is worse. I do her work today.

00:57.480 --> 01:01.390
Oh, no, but you can't. Your
baby is about to pop out of you.

01:01.440 --> 01:03.030
This?

01:03.080 --> 01:05.150
No. Two weeks more.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.950
I work.

01:08.920 --> 01:10.520
All right.

01:11.960 --> 01:14.190
Don't mollycoddle me!

01:14.240 --> 01:17.030
I need to keep busy. My
husband's a nervous wreck.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.200
Your house is always a
tip. I'll help clean.

01:22.180 --> 01:23.280
Hormone inferno.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.270
This takes me back.

01:40.320 --> 01:43.070
I was pregnant for ten years, you know.

01:43.120 --> 01:44.920
Not with the same baby.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.280
All right, I also came
because I'm worried about you.

01:50.480 --> 01:53.550
- I hear your man Hugh was
seen kissing Vasilia. - Yes.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.830
You have to talk to him about it.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.670
I have, but men don't talk properly.

01:58.720 --> 02:01.830
I'm finding it enough of a
struggle with my children.

02:01.880 --> 02:03.910
I'd say Hugh is rather fluent.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.470
Fluent isn't the same as straightforward.

02:06.520 --> 02:08.509
Guess what?

02:08.560 --> 02:10.560
I'm sure my otter's pregnant!

02:11.600 --> 02:13.200
Her nipples are massive!

03:02.240 --> 03:03.830
I'm not an invalid.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.550
More like an over-ripe fruit.

03:05.600 --> 03:07.600
Thank you (!)

03:10.040 --> 03:11.670
You're quiet.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.360
Mmm.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.350
Sorry to hear about Hugh.

03:17.400 --> 03:18.990
Well, you know men,

03:19.040 --> 03:23.670
instant gratification conquers the
deeper joys like allegiance and love.

03:24.220 --> 03:25.400
Not always.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.110
You know, when I first
met Hugh, I thought,

03:29.160 --> 03:31.150
"Here's a charming man

03:31.200 --> 03:34.030
who can't quite decide if
he wants to be an adult."

03:35.180 --> 03:36.080
Yep.

03:41.920 --> 03:43.510
Hey.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.200
Hello, Margo.

03:46.800 --> 03:50.870
Just out of interest, shouldn't
you be attempting to tutor me?

03:50.920 --> 03:52.630
Ah, yes!

03:52.680 --> 03:56.520
Erm, I know, er, let's do
the Latin declension song.

03:57.600 --> 04:02.150
♪ Mensa, mensa, mensam,
mensae, mensae, mensa

04:02.200 --> 04:05.430
And the plural. ♪ Mensae, mensae, mensas

04:05.480 --> 04:09.360
Altogether. ♪ Mensara, mensis, mensis ♪

04:10.880 --> 04:14.430
I'd love us to be the kind of family
who could always talk to one other.

04:14.480 --> 04:16.070
We are, aren't we?

04:16.120 --> 04:19.040
Well, you haven't, recently.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.120
Oh, sorry.

04:23.200 --> 04:25.910
There's actually been a
lot going on in my head

04:25.960 --> 04:29.310
since I realised Donald's quite
good-looking especially with a tan,

04:29.360 --> 04:31.910
- if that's not too shallow.
- You know, darling --

04:31.960 --> 04:36.550
Even though, no, in fact
because, he's not madly exciting.

04:36.600 --> 04:40.310
It's lovely that I can talk
about it, because you're right,

04:40.360 --> 04:42.670
we just forget to communicate, don't we?

04:42.720 --> 04:45.910
And what I like about Donald
is that he's a good talker,

04:45.960 --> 04:48.590
and not just about the
things I'm not interested in,

04:48.640 --> 04:51.680
like science and numbers and
history, but about me, and...

04:53.280 --> 04:55.270
Shall we continue with this later?

04:55.320 --> 04:57.320
Mm.

05:01.320 --> 05:02.020
Mm?

05:13.640 --> 05:15.630
Are you enjoying being back home?

05:15.680 --> 05:19.870
Well, I'm writing horse... but I
can't complain about the view.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.110
Actually, maybe the
bloody view's the problem.

05:23.160 --> 05:26.350
Well, there's less chance of a visit
from the she-devil girlfriend.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.150
Vasilia is beautiful.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.470
- It gives her privileges.
- And obligations.

05:30.520 --> 05:32.190
And she's not that beautiful.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.190
Well, take away the cheekbones
and the hair and the lips

05:35.240 --> 05:36.960
and she's really rather ordinary.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.910
And I'm pleased I saw her kissing Hugh,

05:41.960 --> 05:44.120
because now I know he can't be trusted.

05:45.280 --> 05:49.200
For once, perhaps just
acknowledge that you're upset.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.920
You really like Hugh.

05:56.200 --> 05:57.790
Yes, I do.

05:57.840 --> 06:00.640
But you don't believe that
Vasilia forced herself on him.

06:01.180 --> 06:02.430
(I don't know.)

06:02.480 --> 06:04.830
You know, he's pressuring
me to go back to England.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.070
Well, there are other men on the island.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.120
Oh, no.

06:10.920 --> 06:12.560
Well, talk to him.

06:13.840 --> 06:16.110
Well, if you are really
writing horse ordure,

06:16.160 --> 06:18.550
you can go into town and
buy some of that rubbing oil

06:18.600 --> 06:19.800
that Lugaretzia likes.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.870
I have seen that face three times today

06:22.920 --> 06:24.920
and if I see it once more, I will slap it.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.790
Do you know where Margo is?

06:31.840 --> 06:33.800
No.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.110
- I'm going to go and tell
Theo she's pregnant. - What?

06:41.160 --> 06:42.910
Oh.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.830
Nearly an amusing confusion!

06:44.880 --> 06:47.070
I'm gonna buy her a present.

06:47.120 --> 06:49.110
Margo, not your otter.

06:49.160 --> 06:51.640
It's all different when
you're in love, Gerry.

06:52.720 --> 06:55.280
Everything's funny and sort of shiny.

06:56.680 --> 07:00.710
Of course I miss England but,
well, this is our home now.

07:00.760 --> 07:05.510
I-I see this in exiles the world
over, the-their sense of absence,

07:05.560 --> 07:08.550
of amputation and eventually, it gets you,

07:08.600 --> 07:13.390
a-after a year, or three
or, in my case, 20.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.430
My children love it here.

07:15.480 --> 07:19.070
Yes, me too, but Greece
will always be chaotic,

07:19.120 --> 07:22.310
money will be short, we fry in summer

07:22.360 --> 07:25.990
and grieve in winter for
missed crispy, frosted mornings.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.710
Well, a bit...

07:27.760 --> 07:31.160
And I'm going to convert England
to the joys of olive oil.

07:32.240 --> 07:34.280
So it's not as though we won't visit here.

07:35.400 --> 07:38.070
You do know England can be
rather dreary don't you?

07:38.120 --> 07:40.600
Yes, but not with me, I promise.

07:41.800 --> 07:43.480
It's time to go home.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.600
You have to come with me.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Let me think about it.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.230
~

08:04.280 --> 08:07.270
- Theo, I think our otter's about
to give birth. - How fabulous.

08:07.320 --> 08:11.150
I just have to conclude a meeting
of the Corfu Lunar Society.

08:11.200 --> 08:16.430
Er, this is my friend Gerald
Durrell, naturalist extraordinaire.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.190
Sygharitiria, sygharitiria!

08:18.240 --> 08:20.240
~

08:48.200 --> 08:50.430
Is it one big baby or two small ones?

08:50.480 --> 08:52.110
One big.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.910
Your husband must be thrilled.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.680
- No.
- No.

08:55.840 --> 08:57.390
What a miserable...

08:57.440 --> 09:00.520
His mother died when
she give birth to him.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.480
If Hugh sent you, I'm still deciding.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.360
I'm talking to animals now.

09:20.440 --> 09:21.740
Gerry's work here is done.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.080
Perhaps it is time to leave.

10:41.720 --> 10:43.920
Can I buy your birds?

10:46.800 --> 10:48.910
H-How much?

10:48.960 --> 10:50.960
Poso?

11:02.400 --> 11:04.400
Ooh!

11:07.200 --> 11:09.200
Now set them free.

12:16.480 --> 12:20.680
~

12:28.760 --> 12:30.360
Here you are.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.440
Yes.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.910
You can't say no.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.230
Do you realise what
you're asking me to do?

12:39.280 --> 12:42.350
Abandon the place that my
family and I have come to love.

12:42.400 --> 12:45.320
Th-This has been an adventure for you.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.360
But holidays end.

12:50.080 --> 12:52.710
I-I just met the Rose Beetle Man.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.350
Do you know him?

12:54.400 --> 12:59.280
What the, erm, hobo with
the mangy birds on his back?

13:00.680 --> 13:05.390
Well, to me, it was magical and unique

13:05.440 --> 13:08.840
and you just don't get that sort
of thing in the Home Counties.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.760
~

13:29.000 --> 13:32.080
I-I'm sorry. I'm just disappointed.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.510
I'll stay here with you.

13:38.560 --> 13:40.350
But you want to leave.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.670
I won't be the one to hold you back.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.070
No. No, no. We-We have to be together.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.830
No, you'll resent me.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.000
I can see it already in your eyes.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.230
This is about Spiros, isn't it?

13:54.280 --> 13:56.590
Don't be ridiculous.

13:56.640 --> 14:00.190
He's a happily married man.
He-He's a family friend.

14:00.240 --> 14:03.790
When I gave you those first
flowers those months ago

14:03.840 --> 14:07.670
and he was there, and I said to
you "Careful, they have thorns..."

14:07.720 --> 14:11.560
- Hugh -- - Well, those
thorns were Spiros Americanos.

14:16.880 --> 14:20.380
Come on, back in your cage. You're
scaring the more attractive animals.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.710
Oh, please no.

14:28.800 --> 14:33.190
Tell me you've just spilt something.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.270
- Baby water.
- It begins.

14:35.320 --> 14:38.790
All right. OK. Well, let's erm, not panic.

14:38.840 --> 14:42.390
Then, when we've done
that, what's the plan?

14:42.440 --> 14:45.430
- I have a baby. - Yes, but,
we must get you to the doctor's.

14:47.580 --> 14:48.190
Too late.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.270
You are best child.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.030
- You do it.
- No.

14:52.080 --> 14:54.230
- Yes.
- No, no, I'm not a midwife!

14:56.520 --> 14:58.550
Quite a hullabaloo you're making.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.110
Leonora's broken her water, whatever
it's called, she's having her baby!

15:02.160 --> 15:05.590
What's the hurry? Labour often
takes 24 hours or more, you know.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.350
- Does it?
- Oh, yes.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.310
Even still, go and get Dr Petrides.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.950
What is it about me today
that cries out errand boy?

15:13.760 --> 15:16.280
Oh, hope that's the right one.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.310
- OK, I'm just going to --
- Come back!

15:23.360 --> 15:25.630
I'm looking for a book
on how to give birth!

15:28.560 --> 15:30.790
~

15:30.840 --> 15:32.840
~

15:40.840 --> 15:42.400
- (Lets go, Gerry.)
- Yes!

15:46.480 --> 15:48.080
Dr Petrides?

15:53.120 --> 15:55.200
My appendix has burst again!

15:56.240 --> 15:57.830
Not really.

15:57.880 --> 15:59.640
Hello, Doctor.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.030
You seem busy but, er...

16:13.080 --> 16:15.070
- GET HIM OUT!
- Get out!

16:15.120 --> 16:16.830
Yes. No, I'm sorry. Yes.

16:17.080 --> 16:18.970
And breathe, breathe.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.910
All fours... is that a new thing?

16:21.960 --> 16:24.310
It's actually the best
way of giving birth.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.190
They did a study in New York, I think.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.470
You don't need to give him the details.

16:28.520 --> 16:32.550
Lugaretzia's daughter Leonora's
waters broke in our house

16:32.600 --> 16:35.790
and she was just wondering if you'd
come over and deliver the baby.

16:35.840 --> 16:40.030
You wouldn't ask if you knew how long
we've been waiting for this baby.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.670
And Florence is not a young mother.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.230
- Everything is much more dangerous.
- And I'm your wife!

16:45.280 --> 16:45.990
Yes.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.710
How regular are Leonora's contractions?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.630
Well, she's not even getting them yet.

16:52.680 --> 16:55.910
I told her, have a cup of tea, put
your feet up and light up a cigar.

16:55.960 --> 16:57.590
Well, I'm busy here,

16:57.640 --> 17:01.270
so I'm gonna have to give you
a crash course in childbirth.

17:01.320 --> 17:03.150
All right.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.150
Boil lots of water.

17:05.200 --> 17:06.200
Oh, yes, I knew that one!

17:10.040 --> 17:13.920
Imagine waves crashing
rhythmically on the beach.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.990
- Me?
- No, my wife!

17:17.040 --> 17:18.670
Of course. Yes, sorry.

17:18.720 --> 17:20.349
As you were.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.120
~

17:40.080 --> 17:43.720
So it seems these are what the
encyclopaedia calls paroxysms.

17:45.960 --> 17:49.150
Lugaretzia, you must know what
to do. You've given birth twice.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.910
A long time ago.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.030
I was there, not here looking at the...

17:53.080 --> 17:54.790
Sharp end, yes, yes, yes.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.230
"Presence at Accouchement is the
sole preserve of the obstetrics".

17:58.280 --> 18:01.110
That's clear when you're trying
to help a lady have a baby (!)

18:01.960 --> 18:04.390
No-no, it's all fine. It's all
fine, it's all under control.

18:04.440 --> 18:07.830
"Modesty may be preserved
by the use of a blindfold

18:07.880 --> 18:09.870
on the part of the physician..."

18:09.920 --> 18:11.520
When was this written?

18:15.520 --> 18:17.510
How are you feeling?

18:17.560 --> 18:20.680
Like I've been trampled
underfoot and left for dead.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.830
That wasn't my intention.

18:23.880 --> 18:27.400
I'm hardly going to congratulate
you on your decision.

18:30.600 --> 18:34.350
Why can't there be some safe,
happy ground for men and women?

18:34.400 --> 18:37.520
You know, somewhere between
possession and affection?

18:46.440 --> 18:48.070
Always her.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.830
Welcome to my leaving party.

18:49.880 --> 18:51.720
I'm returning to England.

18:52.760 --> 18:54.350
With...

18:54.400 --> 18:56.400
- With this?
- "This"?

18:57.560 --> 18:59.990
No. It-It cannot happen.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.350
We were together.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.750
What did I do wrong?

19:04.800 --> 19:08.200
You are utterly exhausting.

19:09.320 --> 19:13.950
And so vain and proud that you
still can't see I don't love you,

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
- I love Louisa.
- No.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.950
- No!
- God!

19:21.560 --> 19:23.680
What have you done?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.950
Oh, dear. This is unfortunate.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.720
Hold this. Tight.

19:46.480 --> 19:49.310
I'm going to take your car and get help.

19:49.360 --> 19:51.350
Well, drive carefully, please.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
We don't want any accidents.

20:14.560 --> 20:16.150
Mrs Durrells?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.590
- Vasilia's stabbed Hugh.
- No.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.870
He's in the old olive grove, by the well.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.830
He's all alone, but he was
conscious when I left him.

20:23.880 --> 20:25.550
I know what to do, I'll go to him.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.280
I'll fetch the doctor.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.590
Hello.

20:45.640 --> 20:47.230
Oh, hello.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.960
What are you up to?

20:51.040 --> 20:53.040
Nothing.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.270
I'll buy you a drink.

20:56.320 --> 20:57.990
Isn't it a bit early?

20:58.040 --> 21:00.430
"There is a time to be
born and a time to die."

21:00.480 --> 21:02.870
Nothing else should have a timetable.

21:02.920 --> 21:04.520
You're so frigging deep.

21:12.200 --> 21:15.200
- What's your book?
- Dr Petrides lent it to me.

21:16.240 --> 21:18.240
A Practical Guide To Midwifery.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.880
Leonora's waters have broken.

21:22.920 --> 21:24.510
On our kitchen floor.

21:24.560 --> 21:27.750
- Doesn't that mean she's about to
have her baby? - Well, eventually.

21:27.800 --> 21:30.430
I remember when Mum went
into labour with Gerry.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.070
It took days.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.710
Father took us to the zoo.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.750
When we came back, Mother was still at it

21:35.800 --> 21:37.550
so we went back to the zoo

21:37.600 --> 21:39.600
and then the circus.

21:40.680 --> 21:42.670
The one thing I learnt from Vasilia is...

21:42.720 --> 21:44.600
Don't go out with a girl like Vasilia?

21:46.160 --> 21:47.910
I miss her, actually.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.600
Not just the sex.

21:50.720 --> 21:54.040
Though I was thinking,
perhaps one last time.

21:57.040 --> 21:59.240
I should pop in and see her actually.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.120
That's what I like about Corfu.

22:05.360 --> 22:07.360
Nobody's in a rush.

22:20.680 --> 22:22.680
Ah. The Angel of Death.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.550
You probably think you can
cure this with olive oil, ah?

22:26.600 --> 22:28.190
I could give it a try.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.310
I have many reasons to let you die.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.150
You hate me.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.960
Yeah, well, you started it.

22:36.720 --> 22:38.920
And you drive a silly little car.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.960
A red one.

22:47.480 --> 22:51.480
But now I have to keep you
alive for Mrs Durrells.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.710
Hugh?

22:56.760 --> 22:58.430
Eh, Hugh?

22:58.480 --> 23:00.200
Hugh!

23:14.540 --> 23:16.260
Vasilia?

23:25.420 --> 23:27.650
I'm getting terrible deja vu.

23:27.700 --> 23:29.700
Oh, hello!

23:30.900 --> 23:33.530
- Off somewhere nice?
- Anywhere there are no British.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.330
Ah, well, don't go to Malta.

23:35.380 --> 23:37.730
Apparently it's like a
hot Weston-super-Mare.

23:37.780 --> 23:40.650
- What's happening?
- What was always going to happen.

23:40.700 --> 23:42.690
Shouldn't you shut the door behind you?

23:42.740 --> 23:44.890
The door is already shut behind me.

23:44.940 --> 23:48.140
Can you stop talking like a crap Oracle?

24:03.580 --> 24:06.210
What a brilliantly odd day
this is turning out to be.

24:06.260 --> 24:08.930
Hello! Help!

24:08.980 --> 24:11.090
Oh, Dr Petrides!

24:11.140 --> 24:12.890
Dr Petrides!

24:12.940 --> 24:14.730
Ah.

24:14.780 --> 24:16.540
You...

24:18.700 --> 24:20.370
You have to come now!

24:20.420 --> 24:22.570
Right now. Hugh's been stabbed.

24:22.620 --> 24:24.330
He's bleeding badly.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.650
Oh, you have to go.

24:26.700 --> 24:30.010
Oh, I had false contractions,
you know, Braxton Hicks.

24:30.060 --> 24:32.530
Married to a doctor, you
think they know everything.

24:32.580 --> 24:34.530
I'll stay here. I've had children.

24:34.580 --> 24:37.330
If anything happens, I know
what to do at the sharp end.

24:37.380 --> 24:40.500
- Please go.
- I'll wait till you get back.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.980
He's at his olive grove in Paramonas.

24:51.780 --> 24:56.410
- A stabbing puts this age-old ritual
into perspective. - Yes, it does.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.490
All right?

25:00.540 --> 25:02.770
Yes, it's just more of...

25:03.820 --> 25:05.130
Oh, no. Ooh.

25:05.180 --> 25:06.970
That feels real.

25:07.020 --> 25:09.010
It's all right. It's all right.

25:09.060 --> 25:10.860
Come on.

25:13.180 --> 25:13.760
Oh!

25:15.940 --> 25:18.140
Oh! Oh, no.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.340
Don't worry. I'm here to look after you.

25:29.020 --> 25:34.170
- This must be the first time otters have
been bred in captivity on Corfu. - I'm nervous.

25:34.220 --> 25:36.610
We are at the forefront
of a new science, Gerry:

25:36.660 --> 25:39.260
conservation in action.
I'm terribly excited.

25:47.340 --> 25:49.330
She's sort of rocking.

25:51.740 --> 25:54.130
Probably Lugaretzia's
daughter giving birth.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.780
What?

25:56.820 --> 25:59.490
Nobody minds me watching
animals mate and produce,

25:59.540 --> 26:02.290
but I'm not sure it's quite
the thing if it's a human.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.380
~

26:09.500 --> 26:11.850
~

26:11.900 --> 26:15.900
Once again, I promise I'll forget
what I've seen as soon as this is over.

26:16.740 --> 26:19.130
Now, this stage can of
course last for many, many...

26:19.180 --> 26:21.780
Ah! That looks like the
tip of the head, mind you.

26:23.300 --> 26:25.690
- It's going to be all right,
Lugaretzia. - I am scared.

26:25.740 --> 26:28.690
- She is my best daughter.
- I'm sure they're both excellent.

26:28.740 --> 26:30.930
Don't worry, it's looking
good... up there.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.690
As far as one can ever tell.

26:34.380 --> 26:35.650
Wait.

26:35.700 --> 26:38.330
We don't want her to feel
she's part of the grand tour.

26:38.380 --> 26:40.170
Push! Push! You're doing well.

26:40.220 --> 26:42.330
Let's leave Leslie to it.

26:42.380 --> 26:45.410
- This may be the making of him.
- Yes.

26:45.460 --> 26:47.770
That's it, Leonora,
keep pushing. Keep going.

26:47.820 --> 26:49.490
That's it! Keep it coming!

26:49.540 --> 26:51.140
I want them to hear you in Albania!

26:52.220 --> 26:53.970
I want my husband.

26:54.020 --> 26:55.770
He won't be long.

26:55.820 --> 26:57.490
He's saving a life.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.210
I hope.

26:59.260 --> 27:01.410
How can a woman be so cruel?

27:01.460 --> 27:03.070
Can we concentrate on me?

27:04.020 --> 27:06.330
He can't die, that would be too neat,

27:06.380 --> 27:11.860
what with you giving birth
to a beautiful, healthy baby.

27:21.420 --> 27:23.820
I've waited too long for this baby.

27:24.940 --> 27:26.940
I want it too much!

27:30.980 --> 27:32.770
Come on.

27:32.820 --> 27:34.810
Everything's gonna be all right.

27:37.820 --> 27:39.450
Come on, Hugh, wake up.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.290
Hugh, do you hear me?

27:43.060 --> 27:45.060
~

27:46.100 --> 27:48.980
- ~
- ~

27:54.180 --> 27:55.770
His car kept stalling.

27:55.820 --> 27:57.490
You should have taken mine.

27:57.540 --> 27:59.330
Right, that's it, I'm gonna hit him.

28:03.660 --> 28:05.890
- You did a good job.
- Really?

28:05.940 --> 28:06.710
Damn.

28:10.620 --> 28:12.610
Keep going, keep going.

28:18.460 --> 28:20.050
It's a girl!

28:21.600 --> 28:22.690
How did you get her all in there?

28:22.740 --> 28:25.410
I suppose she must have
been folded up, or something.

28:25.460 --> 28:27.250
Eimai koritsi!

28:27.300 --> 28:29.450
Oh, er, wait, er....

28:29.500 --> 28:31.650
Read out what you have to do afterwards.

28:31.700 --> 28:33.370
- Erm...
- Quickly!

28:33.420 --> 28:37.690
"Parturition may without jeopardy
or prejudice to health be achieved-"

28:37.740 --> 28:42.330
Forget it, forget it. I remember Gerry saying
something about animals gnawing through it, so...

28:42.380 --> 28:45.850
So I'm going to cut the cord,
obviously, if you could just...

28:50.420 --> 28:52.210
Two cubs.

28:52.260 --> 28:54.740
Produced in dignified silence.

28:59.140 --> 29:03.810
Let's hope they are the Adam and Eve
of the otter population on Corfu.

29:03.860 --> 29:05.860
Yeah.

29:09.900 --> 29:11.700
Aw!

29:16.960 --> 29:17.580
Ah!

29:36.940 --> 29:39.220
No, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

29:44.340 --> 29:46.340
~

29:52.180 --> 29:55.660
- There's another one! - No, Leslie, I
think it may be -- - It's the placenta.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.820
Oh, yes. False alarm.

30:05.620 --> 30:07.340
How long have you been there?

30:14.500 --> 30:16.500
Leslie, come here.

30:38.140 --> 30:40.340
I-I think I need to rest.

31:09.500 --> 31:11.180
Who does he look like?

31:12.580 --> 31:14.580
My mother.

31:16.260 --> 31:18.050
What happened?

31:18.100 --> 31:19.820
He happened.

31:26.820 --> 31:28.850
Is he well? Are you... Are you well?

31:28.900 --> 31:30.500
He is. We are.

31:33.300 --> 31:38.050
Hugh needs to go to hospital in
Athens in case of internal damage,

31:38.100 --> 31:40.210
but he's alive.

31:40.260 --> 31:42.260
Everyone's alive.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.820
Hugh needs to give Spiros
a big bunch of flowers.

31:49.220 --> 31:51.220
I'd like to be there for that.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.690
Did the doctor have his baby?

32:22.740 --> 32:24.770
Yes.

32:24.820 --> 32:28.260
- Mother and son are wonderful.
- Ah.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.850
I'm sorry I got you embroiled in Vasilia.

32:33.900 --> 32:36.020
Looks like you came off worse.

32:39.620 --> 32:43.300
I-I should've been more
gracious when you turned me down.

32:44.380 --> 32:46.650
I-I'll just miss you so much.

32:46.700 --> 32:48.900
And I'll miss you too.

32:54.060 --> 32:56.450
You go on half your life about olives

32:56.500 --> 32:59.290
and then you nearly die in an olive grove.

32:59.340 --> 33:01.810
Well, we all love a cosmic joke.

33:01.860 --> 33:03.530
Ow!

33:03.580 --> 33:05.580
Mustn't laugh.

33:06.900 --> 33:09.820
Well, can't sit around here all day.

33:10.980 --> 33:12.580
No.

35:08.820 --> 35:11.050
(Leslie delivered the baby.)

35:11.100 --> 35:13.090
Oh!

35:13.140 --> 35:14.730
It's been quite a day.

35:14.780 --> 35:18.410
Dr Petrides was busy,
apparently, so I had to do it.

35:18.460 --> 35:20.250
Oh, Leslie, darling.

35:20.300 --> 35:22.300
I'm so proud of you.

35:26.740 --> 35:29.170
Where've you been? You look a wreck.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.890
I feel like one.

35:30.940 --> 35:32.730
You should try delivering a baby.

35:32.780 --> 35:34.770
I just have.

35:34.820 --> 35:35.670
Florence's.

35:37.220 --> 35:38.810
It's a boy.

35:38.860 --> 35:42.530
I have never seen more
relieved and excited parents.

35:42.580 --> 35:44.690
Well, we must compare notes.

35:44.740 --> 35:47.340
Was your placenta as enormous as mine?

35:48.660 --> 35:50.810
Where was the doctor?

35:50.860 --> 35:53.570
He was busy tending to Hugh.

35:53.620 --> 35:55.700
Vasilia stabbed him.

35:56.940 --> 35:58.650
No!

35:58.700 --> 36:00.690
Is he going to be all right?

36:00.740 --> 36:02.450
I think so.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.500
It was horrible. I was there.

36:09.540 --> 36:11.540
Hugh and I have decided to part.

36:13.300 --> 36:17.140
And as soon as he's patched up,
he's moving back to England.

36:18.900 --> 36:22.500
I've spent the whole day just
missing everything interesting.

36:25.620 --> 36:27.690
One of the otter cubs has died.

36:27.740 --> 36:29.940
Oh, Gerry, darling.

36:36.100 --> 36:38.700
Still, one's alive.

36:40.860 --> 36:43.370
Would you say that if
they were human babies?

36:43.420 --> 36:45.900
No, no, it's a good point.

36:49.220 --> 36:51.410
Ah! Hooray! I'll come to that in a minute.

36:51.460 --> 36:55.780
First, let me present the man I want
to spend the rest of my life with.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.850
Donald, come and see the baby.

36:59.900 --> 37:02.700
This is Zoltan. We met a few days ago.

37:05.580 --> 37:07.250
Good evening.

37:07.300 --> 37:10.130
You wouldn't be kissing that
if you knew where it'd been.

37:10.180 --> 37:12.450
Zoltan is so delightful.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.290
Yes, I am delightful.

37:14.340 --> 37:16.050
He's Turkish.

37:17.820 --> 37:20.100
Perhaps the baby should leave.

37:42.820 --> 37:44.540
Bless you.

37:46.420 --> 37:49.490
Evlogimeni I Vasilia tou Patros

37:49.540 --> 37:52.930
ke tou Iou ke tou Hagiou Pneumatos...

37:52.980 --> 37:57.970
nin ke ai ke is tous eonas ton eonon.

37:58.020 --> 38:01.250
- Amin. - Amin. - Amen.

38:01.300 --> 38:05.890
En irini tou kyriou theithomen.

38:05.940 --> 38:09.340
Kyrie eleison, kyrie
eleison, kyrie eleison.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.900
~

38:28.860 --> 38:30.450
~

38:30.500 --> 38:32.210

38:32.260 --> 38:33.850
~

38:33.900 --> 38:35.580
~

38:46.940 --> 38:48.530
Technically, as Godfather,

38:48.580 --> 38:51.090
Leslie has the right to
choose the baby's name.

38:51.140 --> 38:52.730
Don't tell him that.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.780
- Why, what's his favourite name?
- Leslie.

38:55.580 --> 38:59.010
Vaptizetai o doulos tou, Angeliki,

38:59.060 --> 39:05.450
eis to onoma tou Patros kai tou
Huiou ke ai tou Hagiou Pneumatos.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.490
Amin.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.890
Um, I don't know if this is allowed,

39:17.940 --> 39:21.180
but I just wanted to say thank
you for letting me be Godfather.

39:23.220 --> 39:25.540
My own father died when I was young...

39:26.580 --> 39:31.890
.. and if that ever happened to
little Angeliki here, God forbid...

39:34.060 --> 39:35.690
Sorry.

39:35.740 --> 39:39.420
Although you do work in a lumber
mill, which can be very dangerous.

39:41.500 --> 39:44.380
If that happens, I'll be here to help.

39:45.820 --> 39:48.780
I used to think I was
very unlucky in life...

39:50.180 --> 39:51.890
.. and a bit of a liability.

39:51.940 --> 39:55.170
But delivering the baby that day,

39:55.220 --> 39:57.810
and being given this opportunity,

39:57.860 --> 40:00.170
it's made me feel very lucky indeed.

40:04.740 --> 40:07.290
It's fine. No, it's
fine, I'm a good catch.

40:07.340 --> 40:08.980
I think it was the oil.

40:15.220 --> 40:17.730
So I haven't actually ruled
out training to be a doctor.

40:17.780 --> 40:19.450
I've sent off for the details.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.500
I think you can do it via correspondence.

40:32.020 --> 40:35.570
So, Hugh is halfway back to England.

40:35.620 --> 40:39.770
Yes, yes, in a tiny sports
car loaded with olives.

40:39.820 --> 40:41.810
Full of hope.

40:41.860 --> 40:44.660
I just... didn't love him enough.

40:47.820 --> 40:49.810
I wonder where Vasilia went?

40:49.860 --> 40:52.210
- It seems she has
escaped from Corfu. - Mmm.

40:52.260 --> 40:56.050
No, I can't help imagining her
on horseback somewhere in Tuscany,

40:56.100 --> 40:58.200
desperately trying to catch up with Hugh.

40:59.740 --> 41:01.930
You write, I believe.

41:01.980 --> 41:04.650
Yes. Yes I'll lend you my novel.

41:04.700 --> 41:07.210
I always feel I could
write superbly if I tried.

41:07.260 --> 41:09.250
Mmm.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.130
And I swim superbly.

41:11.180 --> 41:12.890
So I have no fear.

41:12.940 --> 41:14.930
What does Margo see in you?

41:14.980 --> 41:18.820
When I ride the horse, I have
no fear, for I ride superbly.

41:19.900 --> 41:22.540
You see, I am not a fearful man.

41:39.580 --> 41:41.930
Well, my ferry leaves shortly.

41:41.980 --> 41:46.210
Donald, I'm so sorry I don't love you.

41:46.260 --> 41:49.930
No, no, absolutely, it's-it's fine.

41:49.980 --> 41:51.610
It's like Mother with Hugh.

41:51.660 --> 41:55.250
If there's something missing,
like the yeast in bread,

41:55.300 --> 41:58.060
a couple will never rise.

41:59.140 --> 42:01.340
We just didn't have the yeast.

42:02.380 --> 42:04.060
Well, good luck with Zoltan.

42:07.020 --> 42:08.890
He's superb, isn't he?

42:08.940 --> 42:11.130
- No, he's not.
- Oh.

42:11.180 --> 42:15.530
In fact I'd say you couldn't pick a worse
boyfriend if you scoured the world's prisons.

42:15.580 --> 42:18.370
And I have more yeast inside
me than he'll ever have.

42:18.420 --> 42:21.730
You see, now I'm starting
to like you again

42:21.780 --> 42:23.780
because you're being more interesting.

42:33.820 --> 42:35.930
Dr Petrides had to dash off.

42:35.980 --> 42:38.770
- A child ate a poisonous
frog, or something. - Oh.

42:42.140 --> 42:44.250
You need to take your baby.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.020
Oh, yes.

42:47.020 --> 42:48.770
That's it, isn't it?

42:48.820 --> 42:50.820
There's no time to myself any more.

42:53.020 --> 42:55.810
So how close were you to
taking us back to England?

42:55.860 --> 42:57.650
I would've stayed anyway.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.810
Oh, you'll follow us wherever we go.

42:59.860 --> 43:01.940
There's no escape.

43:04.180 --> 43:06.900
But we should stay here as long as we can.

43:08.060 --> 43:10.130
And I'll try to be more like Spiros.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.480
In love with life and... people.

43:13.420 --> 43:15.620
And I don't care if
that sounds sentimental.

43:24.260 --> 43:26.260
~

43:28.420 --> 43:30.420
Right, let's go home.

43:31.660 --> 43:33.250
Gerry?

43:33.300 --> 43:35.010
Gerry!

43:35.060 --> 43:36.690
Margo!

43:36.740 --> 43:38.730
Mwah!

43:38.780 --> 43:40.770
Bye-bye, Gerry.

43:42.660 --> 43:44.450
Finally, a fight.

43:44.500 --> 43:46.500
I can write about this.

43:48.420 --> 43:50.090
- Oh, God.
- No, no, no, let them.

43:50.140 --> 43:53.060
I've never had men fight over me before.

43:56.100 --> 43:57.740
Right, Larry...

43:58.820 --> 44:01.060
Come on. Come on.

44:05.140 --> 44:07.130
Er, where's Leslie?

44:07.180 --> 44:09.410
Oh, I think he's retelling
the story of the birth

44:09.460 --> 44:12.170
- to one of Lugaretzia's nieces.
- The last time I heard him,

44:12.220 --> 44:14.810
he'd delivered it while
being attacked by otters.

44:14.860 --> 44:17.530
- Leslie? - Leslie? - Les? - Les?

44:17.580 --> 44:19.210
- Leslie? - Leslie? - Leslie?

44:19.260 --> 44:21.050
- What?
- Nothing.

44:29.380 --> 44:31.700
Very good, Leslie. Really good.

44:56.020 --> 44:58.900
I love you all very much, you know.

45:08.780 --> 45:10.380
Sorry.
