<i>Calm down, Wally.</i>

00:08.980 --> 00:11.325
<i>Get away from me!
You don't tell me what to do!</i>

00:11.365 --> 00:13.430
<i>I tell you what to do!</i>
I pay your salary!

00:13.470 --> 00:16.625
–Calm down, Wally. Alright? Take it easy!
–Do you know who I am?

00:16.665 --> 00:18.767
–I’ll tell you who I am!
–I said, calm down, Wally.

00:18.807 --> 00:21.740
–Jenna? What's going on?
–Get out of here, sir!

00:21.780 --> 00:23.815
–I said get the hell out!
–He's my neighbor.

00:23.855 --> 00:25.855
An attorney. What's she being charged with?

00:25.895 --> 00:27.370
Prostitution.
Now stay out of this. Okay?

00:27.410 --> 00:30.970
You'll all pay!
I'm State Senator Wally Bird,

00:31.150 --> 00:33.415
you'll be meter maids by this time
tomorrow, you Keystone Cops,

00:33.455 --> 00:36.307
I'll screw you all!

00:36.342 --> 00:39.125
I'll screw each and every one of you,

00:39.160 --> 00:41.450
I'll screw your mothers!
–Wally!

00:41.830 --> 00:44.575
I'm State Senator… Wally… Bird…!

00:44.610 --> 00:47.646
–He must be a wonderful lover.
–Get off of me!

00:48.070 --> 00:50.005
I'm… Wally… Bird.

01:20.450 --> 01:22.595
I kid you not. Two pageant queens,

01:22.635 --> 01:24.240
Miss Arkansas, Miss Montana,

01:24.280 --> 01:27.665
each one suing the other for defamation
of character. So, the first order of business…

01:27.705 --> 01:29.065
Stop Denny from finding out about it?

01:29.105 --> 01:30.060
You got it.

01:30.410 --> 01:33.860
I smell perfume, petroleum jelly
and duct tape.

01:33.895 --> 01:35.635
There are beauty queens
on the premises.

01:35.675 --> 01:36.670
I'm handling this, Denny.

01:36.710 --> 01:39.665
Shirley! I'll respect these women,
I'm fresh out of rehab!

01:39.705 --> 01:41.210
Even so.

01:42.740 --> 01:44.060
–Denny Crane?
–Yeah?

01:44.500 --> 01:47.070
My name is Joe Gordon.
I was your first client.

01:47.110 --> 01:51.100
You and your father defended
me on a murder charge in 1957.

01:52.540 --> 01:53.670
Butcher Boy Killer?

01:53.710 --> 01:55.970
Alleged. I was innocent.
Remember?

01:56.005 --> 01:57.315
Yeah, right…

01:57.350 --> 02:00.855
This is um… Aaron Sears.

02:00.890 --> 02:03.030
–Denny Crane.
–Yeah, I know who you are.

02:03.070 --> 02:06.898
Mr Sears is the son of the
women I was accused of killing.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.104
–Oh.
–Um… It gets better.

02:09.139 --> 02:10.824
He has a gun in my back,

02:10.860 --> 02:15.282
and he has a vest full of plastic
explosives strapped to his chest.

02:17.380 --> 02:19.096
Looks like we're hostages.

02:21.180 --> 02:22.390
It's a joke, right?

02:22.430 --> 02:24.740
Alan Shore put you up to it. Right?

02:28.810 --> 02:31.340
Oh, boy.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.890
Take it out and put it on.

02:45.640 --> 02:49.930
If my thumb comes off of this button,
both our vests are going to explode.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.055
And so will this entire office.

02:52.090 --> 02:54.645
You will alert the front desk to lock the doors

02:54.685 --> 02:55.980
and shut down the elevators.

02:56.020 --> 02:59.930
If I so much as see a cop,
or I hear sirens outside,

02:59.965 --> 03:02.270
my thumb comes off this button.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.570
–Um… son…
–I'm not your son!

03:06.960 --> 03:08.880
My mother had a son.

03:10.170 --> 03:12.915
I'll just say this and you can
take it for what it's worth.

03:12.955 --> 03:14.970
A lot of clients, former clients,

03:15.010 --> 03:18.095
come up here with the hopes
of blowing me up.

03:18.130 --> 03:21.180
And the reason I'm still
alive is, 'cause…

03:22.130 --> 03:24.245
I don't mind dying.

03:24.280 --> 03:28.155
I got the you know…
the Mad Cow…

03:28.190 --> 03:31.930
my final years promise
to be very demeaning.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.505
I'll drool, mess myself.

03:34.540 --> 03:37.795
That's no way for
Denny Crane to go out.

03:37.830 --> 03:41.015
I wanna go out in a… in a blaze.

03:41.050 --> 03:44.890
You're lying. Don't tell me
you're not scared.

03:46.120 --> 03:51.070
I wanna show you something my
father gave to me when I was seven years old.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.670
This has great sentimental value to me.

03:57.710 --> 04:01.736
I've often thought, “What a
shame if I never got to fire it.”

04:03.490 --> 04:05.860
That gun is new.

04:06.530 --> 04:07.916
Well, I'll be damned.

04:07.950 --> 04:10.788
It's a custom-made dual port,
45 automatic,

04:10.805 --> 04:12.860
cost two grand.

04:13.290 --> 04:15.745
Laser Aim

04:15.780 --> 04:18.779
I got a little red dot
right between your eyes.

04:18.820 --> 04:21.922
Hey. You're willing to die?
I'm willing to die.

04:22.120 --> 04:24.865
But are you willing to
kill your colleagues?

04:24.905 --> 04:28.250
Now put down the gun, Mr Crane.

04:28.670 --> 04:31.540
Please, Mr Crane. This man is serious.

04:45.340 --> 04:46.835
What do you want?

04:46.870 --> 04:49.795
This man killed my mother.
And you and your father got him off.

04:49.835 --> 04:52.000
–I didn't do it!
–Shut up!

04:54.580 --> 04:57.895
You pulled some stupid trick
just to cheat justice.

04:57.935 --> 04:59.845
Well, we're gonna have another trial.

04:59.885 --> 05:01.715
Right here in this office.

05:01.750 --> 05:07.096
Only this time, you and your father,
you're not gonna be able to fix the verdict.

05:09.750 --> 05:12.355
Three, two, one, six, four!
Commonwealth versus Jenna Aesop.

05:12.395 --> 05:14.935
Commonwealth versus Wallace Bird.

05:14.970 --> 05:17.055
Alan Shore for Ms Aesop.
We can waive reading.

05:17.095 --> 05:18.750
Adam Jovanka for Wallace Bird.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.500
I've discussed this matter
with the District Attorney

05:21.540 --> 05:24.425
and I'd like to enter, on behalf of
Mr Bird, a plea of No Contest if—

05:24.465 --> 05:26.250
–No Contest?
–This doesn't involve you.

05:26.290 --> 05:29.935
It certainly does. Especially if your deal
involves him giving testimony against my client.

05:29.975 --> 05:32.167
Your Honor, we can dispose
of this unfortunate matter…

05:32.207 --> 05:34.365
Ten seconds to confirm with my
learned brother, Your Honor.

05:34.405 --> 05:35.795
Hurry up!

05:35.830 --> 05:38.035
The police can't make this.
Did you read the incident report?

05:38.075 --> 05:40.427
I did. It listed my client's
reproductive appendage

05:40.467 --> 05:42.785
as being lodged against
your client's esophagus.

05:42.825 --> 05:44.540
She faces conviction if he cooperates.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.250
–That would be your problem.
–She'll get time.

05:46.290 --> 05:48.555
–That would her problem.
–Ten seconds are up, Counsel.

05:48.595 --> 05:50.945
Seek to remove Mr Jovanka as
Counsel for Mr Bird.

05:50.985 --> 05:52.690
Is it really Bird?
–Your Honor…!

05:52.730 --> 05:55.460
He's about to plea No Contest
to a case the police can't make.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.665
The fact that they were caught
having sex means nothing.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.430
There's no evidence of
money changing hands

05:59.470 --> 06:02.655
and the police can't prove this was anything
other than a consensual relationship

06:02.695 --> 06:06.630
between two people who were,
and still are, very much in love.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.760
Oh? They're in love?

06:08.795 --> 06:10.727
Truly. Madly. Deeply.

06:10.762 --> 06:12.625
Step up here, Counsel.

06:12.660 --> 06:15.762
This is never good when
they ask me to step up.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.270
You think I'm an idiot?

06:22.020 --> 06:25.825
Judge, I cannot be held accountable for what I do
with straight lines lobbed right over the plate.

06:25.865 --> 06:29.132
How would you like to be held
in contempt, Mr Wisenheimer?

06:29.172 --> 06:32.405
Again, Judge, that was a beach ball.
Straight down the middle.

06:32.445 --> 06:33.485
Two days!

06:33.520 --> 06:36.575
Put him in the same cell with his client!
They can discuss her wedding plans.

06:36.615 --> 06:39.660
You can't plan a wedding in two days!

06:42.830 --> 06:45.602
Will they really keep us in here two days?

06:46.010 --> 06:47.375
He might.

06:47.410 --> 06:50.390
Jenna, I thought you'd hung up your spurs.

06:50.890 --> 06:53.570
I need to make money, Alan.

06:54.240 --> 06:57.672
This time, I'm afraid,
you could be in real trouble.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.380
You got a conference room?

07:01.420 --> 07:03.740
Conference room?
I got a Gulf Stream.

07:03.780 --> 07:05.965
Well, let's go to the conference room.

07:06.005 --> 07:07.919
Denny? Is everything alright?

07:07.930 --> 07:10.065
Not especially. I'm a little wired today.

07:10.105 --> 07:12.205
Juror number one, juror number two.
Let's go.

07:12.245 --> 07:13.050
Wha, what's going on?

07:13.090 --> 07:16.885
What's going on is Mr Crane and I are
wearing explosive devices. You two are hostages.

07:16.925 --> 07:19.470
Denny? I made reservations at…

07:20.070 --> 07:22.555
Why are you wearing that ridiculous vest?

07:22.595 --> 07:25.565
Juror number three.
Cancel your reservations.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.905
She like snatched the crown
right off my head!

07:27.945 --> 07:30.032
I snatched the crown?

07:30.067 --> 07:32.085
It's like a metaphor, okay?

07:32.120 --> 07:34.330
You reported my supposed misconduct,

07:34.370 --> 07:37.745
this from a debutant who rode
cowgirl on Miss Hawaii.

07:37.785 --> 07:38.980
Or was that your talent?

07:39.020 --> 07:42.285
Alright! This conference room is being
commandeered for a trial!

07:42.325 --> 07:44.041
This man killed my mother.

07:44.060 --> 07:48.020
This man and his father fixed
the trial and got him freed.

07:48.055 --> 07:50.252
We are now gonna have another trial.

07:50.292 --> 07:52.420
You! Pull out the trial transcripts.

07:52.460 --> 07:56.420
I will be the judge. You. You're gonna
read the transcripts.

07:56.770 --> 07:59.295
And you. You just go ahead
and play your part.

07:59.335 --> 08:01.715
You! You be the jury foreman.

08:01.750 --> 08:05.355
If I so much as see a cop, we
will all explode.

08:05.390 --> 08:08.615
And I was once a cop myself,
so I can spot an undercover officer.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.325
–You! Pretty boy! Get out, you're dismissed.
–Why?

08:11.365 --> 08:13.535
Because you look like pro-prosecution to me

08:13.575 --> 08:15.015
and I wanna have a fair trial.

08:15.055 --> 08:16.992
You! Who are you?

08:17.027 --> 08:18.895
Shirley Schmidt.

08:18.930 --> 08:22.675
You're dismissed, also. You be the voice
of reason between me and the police.

08:22.715 --> 08:26.425
You let 'em know how serious I am.
Because, if my thumb comes off this button,

08:26.465 --> 08:28.555
this whole floor is gonna
be reduced to rubble.

08:28.595 --> 08:31.230
So go on. Out! Now!

08:32.539 --> 08:36.260
Sir? What do you really
hope to accomplish here?

08:37.260 --> 08:39.830
You will hear the evidence.

08:39.865 --> 08:42.400
You will render a fair verdict.

08:42.434 --> 08:44.540
Or you will die.

09:00.980 --> 09:02.400
You cannot go out there.

09:02.440 --> 09:05.405
He says if he even sees a police officer…

09:05.440 --> 09:08.925
also he claims that he can
spot any undercover agent, so…

09:08.965 --> 09:11.345
I can do reconnaissance.
He knows I'm a lawyer.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.120
I'm an ex-Marine. I'm combat trained.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.760
Alright. Check the air ducts.
See if there's any way to get access.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.105
What are you gonna do? Send in a dwarf?
There's one in there already.

09:21.145 --> 09:23.600
Maybe we can pump in some sleeping gas.
Put him out.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.985
Not a good idea. He falls asleep, his thumb
comes off the button.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.020
I'll just check, Shirley.

09:29.450 --> 09:32.160
I was three years old
when he killed my mother.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.875
My father never really
got over what happened.

09:34.915 --> 09:36.555
It broke him.

09:36.590 --> 09:39.035
He started drinking,
he started hitting us.

09:39.075 --> 09:41.535
My brother ran away when I was ten.

09:41.570 --> 09:46.652
Then a couple years later my Dad takes
his car and he drives it into a truck.

09:46.900 --> 09:50.355
Drinking? Suicide? Both?
I don't know.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.575
Then my life started going
pretty much the same way.

09:52.615 --> 09:55.127
I started drinking. And drugs.
Bad marriage.

09:55.167 --> 09:57.610
Next thing you know,
I'm hittin' my own kids.

09:57.650 --> 10:00.565
Because this man's violence
infected my whole life.

10:00.605 --> 10:03.260
Because him and his father got him off.

10:06.890 --> 10:09.670
That concludes my opening statement.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.470
You wanna make one?

10:15.750 --> 10:16.935
Yes.

10:16.970 --> 10:18.910
Go ahead.

10:20.460 --> 10:23.510
Members of the jury…

10:24.030 --> 10:27.040
I stand before you…

10:29.030 --> 10:31.930
with my father I guess…

10:35.660 --> 10:38.370
representing an innocent man.

10:42.510 --> 10:44.860
He killed this woman.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.310
Oh, now wait a minute.

10:46.350 --> 10:48.290
There's no question in my mind.
He's guilty.

10:48.330 --> 10:53.440
And every single piece of evidence
that's gonna be presented in
that courtroom says he is.

10:53.480 --> 10:55.265
He's no murderer.

10:55.300 --> 10:58.590
I can't base it on any
evidence or anything.

10:58.625 --> 11:01.382
It's something I feel.

11:01.417 --> 11:04.140
And the way he sits there.

11:05.470 --> 11:07.295
You don't know what
you're talking about, boy.

11:07.335 --> 11:10.210
You've got a lot to learn.

11:12.430 --> 11:14.670
Talk! Dammit!

11:18.690 --> 11:20.695
Members of the jury.

11:20.730 --> 11:25.570
Joseph Gordon did not kill Helen Sears.

11:26.330 --> 11:28.790
He didn't do it.

11:39.090 --> 11:40.915
–What's this?
–What's this?

11:40.950 --> 11:43.180
You pissed off the Judge,
that's what this is.

11:43.220 --> 11:46.955
After I gave him a piece of my mind for
not takin' my plea, he throws me in.

11:46.995 --> 11:49.180
Now, why wouldn't he take my deal?
Because of you!

11:49.220 --> 11:51.995
You think you're really gonna have a career
in this town after I get done with you?

11:52.035 --> 11:53.830
Mr Bird, you're a carpet salesman.

11:53.870 --> 11:57.505
The fact that you were able to buy
your way into public office, no

11:57.545 --> 11:59.250
doubt by evading income taxes…

11:59.290 --> 12:01.245
I will knock you to the ground,
sure as I'm standing here.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.100
Shut up, Wally. Just shut up.

12:03.140 --> 12:06.825
Honey. I gotta make this go away.
You know I do.

12:06.860 --> 12:11.465
The problem is Jenna goes away if you admit
that prostitution took place here.

12:11.505 --> 12:12.891
Was I talking to you?

12:12.900 --> 12:17.454
You were talking to my client, Mr Bird.
She's represented by Counsel.

12:20.050 --> 12:24.370
His name is Aaron Sears…
dishonorable military discharge…

12:24.405 --> 12:27.352
worked briefly in law enforcement…

12:27.387 --> 12:30.300
in and out of rehab facilities.

12:31.660 --> 12:33.270
What the hell are you doing?

12:33.310 --> 12:38.080
This duct here might connect to the other
ducts running into the conference room.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.655
If I can shimmy in I might be able
to tell where they lead.

12:40.695 --> 12:44.145
You're not gonna go into that vent?
Don't be ridiculous!

12:44.185 --> 12:46.085
Shirley, I'm practically a Navy Seal!

12:46.125 --> 12:48.490
Shouldn't seals be in water?

12:51.430 --> 12:53.775
Ah… I'm stuck.

12:53.810 --> 12:55.335
Well, what do you mean you're stuck?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.475
I mean… ah… I can't get out.

12:58.510 --> 13:01.930
I knew you'd go Die Hard, first chance.

13:01.965 --> 13:05.040
Shirley! Can you… help me?

13:12.000 --> 13:14.570
I, I was the maid and
I had the night off.

13:14.610 --> 13:17.585
I arrived at the Sears'
residence at around nine PM.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.165
And what did you see?

13:19.200 --> 13:22.555
As I opened the door, that man ran out,
the defendant.

13:22.595 --> 13:24.882
He struck me and I fell to the ground.

13:24.922 --> 13:27.180
Are you sure it was the defendant?

13:28.030 --> 13:30.775
Positive. And then when I went inside

13:30.810 --> 13:34.470
I discovered Mrs Sears
lying on the floor.

13:37.010 --> 13:39.035
Can you describe her?

13:39.070 --> 13:41.530
She was dead. Her face was purple.

13:41.565 --> 13:44.042
There were bruises on her throat.

13:44.077 --> 13:46.520
It looked like she'd been strangled.

13:47.020 --> 13:48.375
Your witness.

13:48.410 --> 13:51.860
Do your father's cross
and read it exactly.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.685
A man runs at you. Strikes you.
Runs away. How long did this take?

13:56.725 --> 13:58.032
Seconds.

13:58.067 --> 13:59.305
Seconds?

13:59.340 --> 14:03.450
Can you really be sure that
this is the man you saw?

14:03.485 --> 14:05.800
Yes. I'll never forget his face.

14:05.835 --> 14:07.790
He's the man.

14:11.490 --> 14:13.690
Nothing further.

14:17.230 --> 14:19.455
But I wanna tell you this.

14:19.490 --> 14:22.780
He killed that woman as sure as
I'm standing in front of you,

14:22.820 --> 14:27.176
and I don't want to see him walk
out of that courtroom a free man.

14:28.270 --> 14:31.702
It may seem a little shocking, but
that's the truth.

14:31.860 --> 14:32.860
You're hanging that boy.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.680
That's not so.
He's hanged himself.

14:35.970 --> 14:37.835
But you're his lawyer. You're supposed
to do everything you can to—

14:37.875 --> 14:40.040
Don't tell me what I'm supposed to do.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.065
I'm here to give him an ethical defense,
so that's what I'm giving him.

14:43.105 --> 14:44.975
You know the meaning of that word?

14:45.015 --> 14:47.000
I know what it means.

14:48.440 --> 14:51.725
But your personal ethics are
killing him and you know that.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.257
That's enough!

14:53.292 --> 14:54.750
Mr Crane!

14:56.150 --> 14:58.680
Mr Crane! Can you hear me?

14:59.790 --> 15:04.476
Pick up the phone, and see whoever
it is and ask them not to interrupt!

15:10.480 --> 15:12.230
Yeah.

15:14.290 --> 15:17.600
Hostage Rescue Team.
They wanna talk to you.

15:21.860 --> 15:23.290
No, I don't have any demands.

15:23.330 --> 15:27.686
Yes, I do have an exit strategy.
I believe you people call it SBC.

15:28.660 --> 15:29.990
What, what does that mean?

15:30.030 --> 15:35.090
SBC. Suicide by cop. He's not planning
on leaving this place alive.

15:49.130 --> 15:50.480
There's no evidence of a transaction.

15:50.520 --> 15:55.655
If both you and Wally claimed
it was just consensual sex,
with no money changing hands,

15:55.695 --> 15:59.335
the police really can't prove otherwise.
Unless one of you cooperates.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.505
I get that, Alan.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.475
Yes, but Jenna, he's the bigger fish.

16:03.510 --> 16:07.385
If you're willing to flip Wally, I'm sure the DA
would much rather deal with you.

16:07.425 --> 16:09.540
I heard that!

16:10.730 --> 16:12.025
I can't,

16:12.060 --> 16:13.600
Wally's been too good to me.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.285
He's trying to make a deal that puts you in jail.
Would you prefer that?

16:17.325 --> 16:19.899
I'd prefer you think of something else.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.240
–The story's broken.
–Aw crap.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.315
You bastard.

16:25.350 --> 16:27.220
It's only on the wire services,

16:27.260 --> 16:31.200
television will hold it 'till tonight if
I promise to give them a quote.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.815
Fortunately, there's a hostage
situation somewhere,

16:33.855 --> 16:36.385
so that's getting all the play.

16:36.420 --> 16:40.710
Then. Wally, I'd better bring Harriet down
here so you can tell her.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.930
Better she hear it from you.

16:42.965 --> 16:45.582
Oh God. Oh God!

16:45.617 --> 16:48.200
Harriet would be…?

16:48.235 --> 16:49.940
His wife.

16:54.010 --> 16:56.085
How far that way 'til we're
within his eye line?

16:56.125 --> 16:57.110
This is about it.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.645
This is Lieutenant James, he's head
of the Hostage Rescue Team.

16:59.685 --> 17:00.435
Hello.

17:00.470 --> 17:02.875
Do you know how to work the inter-office
communications system?

17:02.915 --> 17:04.275
I think so.

17:04.310 --> 17:05.930
You still okay, Sir?

17:05.964 --> 17:07.704
Fine.

17:07.740 --> 17:10.430
The prosecution calls
Dr Malcolm Sears.

17:10.464 --> 17:12.906
I'll read his part. He was my father.

17:12.930 --> 17:15.234
The man you tricked when
he was on the witness stand!

17:15.275 --> 17:17.545
Objection. Is this supposed
to be a fair trial or not?

17:17.585 --> 17:19.440
Ask the questions.

17:19.474 --> 17:21.359
Dad?

17:21.500 --> 17:25.500
Karen?

17:28.089 --> 17:29.525
Don't do this, Dad!

17:29.560 --> 17:31.825
No. You don't understand.

17:31.860 --> 17:34.925
This is the right thing to do!
I am doing something right!

17:34.965 --> 17:38.215
For God's sake, Dad, please
don't hurt these people.

17:38.255 --> 17:39.615
They have families!

17:39.650 --> 17:41.580
Honey. You'll understand some day.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.480
They have people who love them!

17:43.520 --> 17:46.226
–Turn this thing off!
–Dad, listen to me!

17:53.690 --> 17:56.470
Okay. You just shot
your own daughter.

17:56.505 --> 17:57.185
Shut up.

17:57.220 --> 17:59.645
I'm just saying. You're not making
a very good impression on the jury.

17:59.685 --> 18:01.675
Debbie. Please shut up.

18:01.710 --> 18:05.015
May I please say something,

18:05.050 --> 18:08.880
fully realizing that jurors
are supposed to be quiet?

18:12.810 --> 18:17.290
My mother was the victim of a
violent sexual attack.

18:17.325 --> 18:20.400
I walked in on it. I was three years old.

18:20.435 --> 18:23.025
I suffered a severe trauma.

18:23.060 --> 18:26.645
In fact, the doctors are convinced
it's why I stopped growing.

18:26.685 --> 18:30.075
After twenty-nine years of therapy,

18:30.110 --> 18:33.745
three months ago, I finally started to grow again.

18:33.780 --> 18:38.250
What you're doing here is gonna stunt
my growth all over again.

18:38.285 --> 18:42.870
I'm gonna be a little dwarf forever.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.665
Do you take me for a complete idiot?

18:47.705 --> 18:49.310
I take you for a total nut job!

18:49.350 --> 18:51.820
Just let us out before a sniper
puts you nightie night!

18:51.860 --> 18:56.950
Somebody shoots me lady,
my thumb comes off of this button!

19:00.960 --> 19:02.490
We're gonna resume the trial.

19:02.530 --> 19:05.485
We're getting to your
big strategy now, Mr Crane.

19:05.525 --> 19:07.770
Remember that?

19:08.590 --> 19:11.150
This is a cheap ten-cents-store
trick and I won't touch it.

19:11.190 --> 19:13.350
I've never done a thing like that in
a courtroom in my life.

19:13.390 --> 19:16.400
But it's our job to try and save
his life, dad, and this might do it.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.415
I'm not gonna turn this trial into
a circus to get him off.

19:19.455 --> 19:20.555
Do you hear me?

19:20.590 --> 19:23.570
<i>Mr Crane. Mr Crane.</i>

19:24.370 --> 19:27.280
I said start at the top
of page seventy-two!

19:35.230 --> 19:37.805
Do you see the man, Dr Sears,

19:37.840 --> 19:40.085
who ran out of your apartment building?

19:40.125 --> 19:41.705
Yes, the defendant.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.340
Are you absolutely positive

19:44.375 --> 19:46.940
the man you saw that night

19:46.975 --> 19:49.817
is sitting right here?

19:49.852 --> 19:52.660
I'm one hundred percent positive.

19:57.480 --> 20:00.375
Do you wanna tell the jury
what just happened?

20:00.415 --> 20:01.645
I'll tell.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.555
He put a man who looked like
Joe Gordon at the defense table.

20:05.595 --> 20:09.140
Then he got my father to identify
the wrong man!

20:11.730 --> 20:15.230
My mother's killer went free
because of that trick.

20:19.730 --> 20:22.150
Prosecution rests.

20:23.580 --> 20:26.170
Read your next line.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.010
Defense rests.

20:51.310 --> 20:53.605
You can go outside the room and deliberate,

20:53.645 --> 20:56.187
but stay right there within my sight.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.206
Hold on a second. I wanna testify.

20:58.246 --> 21:00.160
Why? You didn't testify at the trial.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.690
Exactly. Which is why people
thought me guilty.

21:02.730 --> 21:05.185
You got to put in new evidence,
so should I.

21:05.225 --> 21:07.035
I put in the real truth.

21:07.070 --> 21:09.065
Well, let me offer the real truth.

21:09.105 --> 21:11.350
Not even he knows it.

21:12.790 --> 21:14.700
Alright.

21:15.110 --> 21:17.930
Defense calls Joe Gordon.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.750
My God, Wally. What's happened?

21:27.785 --> 21:28.810
I'm okay, Harriet. Sit.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.300
What have you done?

21:30.335 --> 21:32.800
Please! Sit, sweetheart.

21:33.710 --> 21:35.465
I'm getting short of breath.

21:35.505 --> 21:37.610
Privacy, please.

21:37.645 --> 21:40.455
Look away.

21:40.490 --> 21:43.310
This is private.

21:44.530 --> 21:46.485
Harriet, ah.

21:46.520 --> 21:50.820
I wanna talk to you about
our… sexual life.

21:50.855 --> 21:53.080
I didn't know we had one.

21:53.115 --> 21:54.885
Which is what…

21:54.920 --> 21:58.850
Harriet… how do I say this?

21:59.220 --> 22:02.550
I'm very un-proud of my
physical self…

22:02.585 --> 22:04.255
and it's…

22:04.290 --> 22:08.500
very difficult for me to feel
good about my body.

22:13.030 --> 22:16.215
This morning I was arrested for having
sexual relations with a prostitute.

22:16.255 --> 22:18.795
I am very ashamed, Harriet.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.600
It has nothing to do
with my love for you.

22:20.640 --> 22:24.770
It's more about my own
physical loathing that…

22:26.710 --> 22:30.620
It was never my intent to humiliate you…

22:32.730 --> 22:35.720
and I'm sorry.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.290
Oh, please…

22:44.770 --> 22:47.240
say something, Harriet.

22:52.350 --> 22:54.640
Please…

22:56.200 --> 22:58.300
let me out.

22:59.010 --> 23:01.240
Guard!

23:12.040 --> 23:18.190
Joe? You refused to testify at the
original trial back in 1957.

23:18.225 --> 23:19.475
That's right.

23:19.510 --> 23:23.855
You even refused to say where you were
at the time of Mrs Sears' murder?

23:23.895 --> 23:25.145
Yes.

23:25.180 --> 23:27.485
My father told you to testify.

23:27.520 --> 23:31.995
He said it was your only chance to convince
the jury of your innocence.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.830
That's right.

23:34.390 --> 23:37.125
What you don't know… or perhaps you do.

23:37.160 --> 23:40.765
This refusal on your part made my
father think you were guilty.

23:40.805 --> 23:42.642
I suspected as much.

23:42.677 --> 23:44.753
So my question is…?

23:44.788 --> 23:46.830
Why not testify?

23:54.220 --> 23:57.600
At the time Mrs Sears was killed…

23:57.635 --> 23:59.945
I was in the building.

23:59.980 --> 24:03.750
But I was never in the
Sears' apartment.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.520
I was at the apartment of a friend.

24:09.140 --> 24:12.035
My lover.

24:12.070 --> 24:14.930
A married man.

24:17.270 --> 24:21.185
I couldn't say that back then.

24:21.220 --> 24:25.045
Not in 1957, not even with the risk
of being convicted of murder.

24:25.085 --> 24:27.820
A crime I didn't commit.

24:28.420 --> 24:30.970
My mother was in the courtroom.

24:31.005 --> 24:33.915
Being gay was…

24:33.950 --> 24:36.660
they didn't even have that word.

24:36.695 --> 24:38.595
You were a queer.

24:38.630 --> 24:42.440
It would have ruined Tim's life,
and mine. Destroyed my mother.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.365
So when you told me that… maybe you
could get me acquitted some other way…

24:46.405 --> 24:49.750
Oh, come on! This is just another trick!

24:49.785 --> 24:51.675
It's not a trick, Mr Sears.

24:51.710 --> 24:54.555
It was me your father saw leave
the apartment building.

24:54.595 --> 24:57.405
When I heard the commotion,
I just got the hell out.

24:57.445 --> 25:00.260
But I was not in your apartment.

25:00.610 --> 25:03.600
I did not kill your mother.

25:13.430 --> 25:17.680
Well, well, well. And what lessons
have we learned today?

25:17.715 --> 25:21.930
Standing here, I've learned that
you smell like cheese.

25:24.330 --> 25:26.160
Back to jail they go.

25:26.195 --> 25:27.990
That was an olive branch.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.105
Got a text message from
Paul Lewiston.

25:43.145 --> 25:45.730
They're starting closing arguments.

25:49.580 --> 25:52.275
It wasn't just my father who saw him.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.935
Mrs Bailey, the maid, she saw him too.

25:54.970 --> 26:00.260
She testified that she would
never forget his face.

26:00.295 --> 26:02.600
It's right here in the transcript.

26:02.635 --> 26:03.705
Oh, he did it.

26:03.740 --> 26:06.908
There's no evidence of anybody
else being there.

26:06.930 --> 26:10.098
He's the man. He's the man
who killed my mother.

26:13.660 --> 26:15.465
The man looked like Joe.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.185
We know that, because that's how
I was able to pull the stunt.

26:18.225 --> 26:20.720
Put in a man who looked like…
but wasn't… Joe.

26:20.760 --> 26:24.255
The maid? Saw the man in a flash,
got hit, knocked down,

26:24.295 --> 26:25.950
and I don't have to tell this jury,

26:25.990 --> 26:29.000
a bunch of lawyers, that
eyewitness testimony

26:29.035 --> 26:33.195
is the most unreliable of all evidence.

26:33.230 --> 26:36.125
There's no other evidence!
There's no fingerprints of Joe. Nothing.

26:36.165 --> 26:38.807
Your father saw my client.

26:38.842 --> 26:41.406
The maid saw someone else.

26:41.441 --> 26:43.970
My client shouldn't go free

26:44.005 --> 26:45.635
because of a trick.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.440
My client should go free

26:48.960 --> 26:51.650
because of reasonable doubt.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.025
Okay.

27:00.060 --> 27:02.255
Go! Deliberate.

27:02.290 --> 27:05.035
And I want a real verdict!
Don't try to patronize me.

27:05.075 --> 27:07.025
I want a real verdict, because
if I don't get one…

27:07.065 --> 27:08.515
Small point of order.

27:08.550 --> 27:11.320
How will you be able to tell
if we just shine you on?

27:11.360 --> 27:14.095
You don't strike me as
an astute judge of character.

27:14.135 --> 27:16.165
Just go! Hey!

27:16.200 --> 27:18.870
Don't underestimate my ability to know

27:18.905 --> 27:21.540
if you're being genuine or not.

27:32.420 --> 27:34.928
What happens if they come back guilty?

27:34.935 --> 27:37.457
Then you die.

27:37.492 --> 27:39.945
And not guilty?

27:39.980 --> 27:42.440
That's for me to know.

27:53.450 --> 27:55.275
There's clearly reasonable doubt.

27:55.315 --> 27:57.000
One lone witness?
–Two.

27:57.410 --> 27:59.270
The father's ID only goes to
the building.

27:59.310 --> 28:01.100
The defendant admits he
was in the building.

28:01.140 --> 28:04.505
Oh, please. He's guilty. I'm getting sick
of killers pulling the gay card.

28:04.545 --> 28:06.110
How can you conclude he's guilty?

28:06.150 --> 28:08.050
One eyewitness which
happened in seconds.

28:08.090 --> 28:12.065
I can conclude he's guilty because if we
come back “Not Guilty” he'll blow us all up!

28:12.105 --> 28:15.105
I think we'd better give
this man a real verdict

28:15.145 --> 28:16.230
And it should be “Guilty”.

28:16.270 --> 28:18.375
I say, “Not Guilty”, there's
not enough evidence.

28:18.415 --> 28:19.285
I agree.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.795
There no evidence whatsoever
of anyone else being there!

28:21.835 --> 28:24.075
That's because the police
only focused on Joe!

28:24.115 --> 28:25.437
Because the maid saw him.

28:25.477 --> 28:26.730
Thought she saw him.

28:26.770 --> 28:29.095
Look. The man didn't testify
at the real trial.

28:29.135 --> 28:30.480
That tells me he did it.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.700
It's his choice not to testify and you are

28:32.740 --> 28:35.620
barred from construing that against him.

28:35.655 --> 28:37.722
Right. Like that never happens.

28:37.757 --> 28:40.088
He said why he didn't testify.

28:40.123 --> 28:42.385
He's a homosexual, gay, man.

28:42.420 --> 28:44.225
Who's gonna admit that in the fifties?

28:44.265 --> 28:46.505
In Arkansas, they still don't.

28:46.540 --> 28:51.070
Okay. What we've heard does
not satisfy the State's burden.

28:51.105 --> 28:53.025
Are we gonna do this for real or not?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.445
Yeah. Great.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.475
Let's give the man a real verdict
and all go kaboom!

28:57.515 --> 28:59.760
Are you people nuts?

29:00.680 --> 29:03.650
You've had quite the big career,
haven't you?

29:04.540 --> 29:06.915
Denny Crane.

29:06.950 --> 29:09.690
It all started with this case,
I bet.

29:11.710 --> 29:14.900
I bet your father was
real proud of you.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.700
<i>Why did you become a lawyer?</i>

29:20.380 --> 29:22.565
<i>Do you know?</i>

29:22.600 --> 29:23.905
I don't know if I know.

29:23.945 --> 29:26.135
Well, I know.

29:26.170 --> 29:29.035
You became a lawyer because ever
since you were that high,

29:29.075 --> 29:32.580
I made you want
to become a lawyer.

29:33.650 --> 29:34.920
It's been a good life for me

29:34.960 --> 29:37.996
and I thought it would be
a good life for you.

29:40.140 --> 29:42.890
Now I don't know.

29:43.990 --> 29:48.250
We don't think alike you and I.

29:50.740 --> 29:54.040
I don't really know you.

30:19.290 --> 30:20.770
Thanks for coming back, Harriet.

30:20.810 --> 30:22.390
The lawyers have all worked it out.

30:22.430 --> 30:25.755
If we all stay quiet, the police
can't prove nothing.

30:25.795 --> 30:28.200
It's all gonna be fine.

30:28.720 --> 30:33.472
I'd probably be home right now,
if it wasn't for Mr Bigmouth over there.

30:38.950 --> 30:42.245
You know, ah, I thought
maybe we could take a trip.

30:42.285 --> 30:45.610
Maybe go to Italy.

30:45.645 --> 30:48.600
Or Europe.

30:51.790 --> 30:53.655
I never…

30:53.690 --> 30:56.630
deluded myself that you were celibate.

30:56.665 --> 30:58.335
I suppose…

30:58.370 --> 31:01.680
I should be relieved it's a prostitute,

31:01.715 --> 31:04.355
and not an affair.

31:04.390 --> 31:08.200
I would never have an affair. Never.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.975
Harriet.

31:14.010 --> 31:16.335
Aren't you…

31:16.370 --> 31:18.660
sexually in need?

31:19.380 --> 31:22.020
There are services that you could go to.

31:22.250 --> 31:26.580
Maybe we should consider ah…
what do they call it?

31:26.870 --> 31:28.395
An open marriage.

31:28.430 --> 31:31.960
There's no such thing
as an “open marriage.”

31:31.995 --> 31:33.925
Divorce is open.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.990
Marriage is… pretending.

31:37.025 --> 31:39.485
Denial.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.600
That's a very cynical thing to say.

31:41.640 --> 31:45.900
Once two people admit that
it's not what they want

31:45.935 --> 31:49.502
to wake up with the same
person in perpetuity…

31:49.537 --> 31:53.070
the choice becomes either
divorce or compromise.

31:53.490 --> 31:57.750
It's much easier to just
pretend, isn't it, Wally?

31:59.470 --> 32:03.220
Get a big house, buy nice things,

32:03.255 --> 32:05.895
go on expensive trips,

32:05.930 --> 32:09.020
all the trappings of a happy life.

32:09.810 --> 32:13.280
The only problem is you've been caught.

32:14.500 --> 32:17.365
Now others know.

32:17.400 --> 32:20.420
Our façade has been broken.

32:21.710 --> 32:26.480
It wasn't enough that you did a hooker!

32:27.780 --> 32:30.530
You had to get caught!

32:31.730 --> 32:35.590
And now they all know!

32:38.710 --> 32:40.060
Guard!

32:40.480 --> 32:42.450
Guard!

33:29.430 --> 33:30.725
Verdict's in.

33:30.760 --> 33:34.345
Okay. This is where you leave.
All civilians out!

33:34.380 --> 33:37.660
We'll grant you an exception, Brad,
'cause you're combat-trained.

33:37.700 --> 33:39.660
Okay.

33:40.320 --> 33:42.140
You reach your verdict?

33:42.175 --> 33:44.410
We have.

33:46.260 --> 33:48.420
Unanimous?

33:52.760 --> 33:55.050
Yes.

33:58.570 --> 34:01.280
What is it?

34:05.990 --> 34:07.370
Not guilty.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.679
There wasn't enough, Mr Sears.

34:17.715 --> 34:20.639
There clearly is reasonable doubt.

34:21.469 --> 34:24.889
I promise you, I'm innocent.

34:30.060 --> 34:32.290
I promise you.

34:35.159 --> 34:36.810
Please. Please. Please.

34:38.870 --> 34:41.335
No. Do not do this, Mr Sears.

34:41.370 --> 34:44.730
You kill yourself, you kill us all.

35:19.450 --> 35:21.215
Stay where you are!

35:21.250 --> 35:23.500
Don't come near me.
–Sir?

35:24.710 --> 35:26.165
It's over now, Sir.

35:26.200 --> 35:29.880
When my thumb comes off this
button it'll definitely be over.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.950
You don't want that.

35:31.985 --> 35:33.945
Shut up. Shut up!

35:33.980 --> 35:36.220
–Mr Sears.
–Get away!

35:43.840 --> 35:48.280
I believed in Joseph Gordon's
innocence back then,

35:48.315 --> 35:50.810
as I do today.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.265
Because I was so convinced
that he didn't do it,

35:55.305 --> 35:58.395
I was willing to…

35:58.430 --> 36:01.295
resort to a stunt to get him off.

36:01.330 --> 36:04.630
But, I never once
considered your father.

36:08.830 --> 36:11.460
I never considered the…

36:12.370 --> 36:15.180
hurt, the damage.

36:15.890 --> 36:18.080
To him.

36:19.160 --> 36:21.850
To his children.

36:23.590 --> 36:27.610
I should have reached out
to your father.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.670
His anger for me, and yours is…

36:32.630 --> 36:35.180
totally justified.

36:40.040 --> 36:42.010
I'm sorry.

36:45.340 --> 36:47.215
Please…

36:47.250 --> 36:52.680
so that no other innocent lives
are destroyed…

36:53.740 --> 36:56.110
give that to me.

36:56.630 --> 36:58.750
Please.

37:02.830 --> 37:05.190
Give it to me.

37:07.170 --> 37:10.420
You're gonna have to
hold the button down.

37:14.510 --> 37:16.905
–Down on your knees, sir!
–I'm not good with remotes.

37:16.945 --> 37:19.950
Pass it to me. Pass it slowly. Slowly.

37:38.620 --> 37:40.720
Judge says you can go.

37:55.630 --> 37:57.540
Wally.

38:00.070 --> 38:02.660
Or perhaps I should say,

38:02.695 --> 38:05.445
Senator Wally.

38:05.480 --> 38:10.285
I'm certainly no expert on
marriage,

38:10.320 --> 38:14.240
and on relationships in general.
Personally,

38:15.010 --> 38:18.250
I'm… well… disabled.

38:18.700 --> 38:24.160
But from what I heard
going on in this cell,

38:24.195 --> 38:26.755
you and Harriet

38:26.790 --> 38:29.845
seem to love each other very much.

38:29.880 --> 38:34.820
I suspect the anger she feels
can only come from love.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.850
And… well…

38:39.400 --> 38:42.135
as the resident bigmouth,

38:42.170 --> 38:44.720
I think it's my duty to say…

38:44.755 --> 38:47.235
don't let her give up on you.

38:47.270 --> 38:50.700
I know you won't give up on her.

38:50.735 --> 38:53.910
Don't let her give up on you.

39:24.230 --> 39:26.810
Here I am thinking
I was having a day.

39:27.370 --> 39:29.120
Are you alright, Denny?

39:29.155 --> 39:31.222
Fine. And I won.

39:31.257 --> 39:33.290
Still undefeated.

39:37.860 --> 39:41.880
That must have been
some trial in 1957.

39:41.915 --> 39:44.307
You and your father.

39:44.342 --> 39:46.700
We made quite a team.

39:47.920 --> 39:50.145
Two birds of a feather.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.815
What did he say when the verdict
came back? Your father?

39:52.855 --> 39:56.007
Oh, he hugged me. The usual.

39:56.042 --> 39:59.125
Proud papa. You know how it goes.

39:59.160 --> 40:02.660
I don't actually.
My father was never proud of me.

40:04.010 --> 40:07.904
It's a terrible thing to be
disapproved of by your own dad.

40:09.280 --> 40:11.555
I wouldn't know.

40:11.590 --> 40:13.950
Well! You led a charmed life.

40:13.985 --> 40:16.130
Denny Crane.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.830
I bought a carpet for one of my
houses from Fat Wally Bird.

40:20.865 --> 40:23.830
Is he still that same
empty sack, blowhard?

40:25.810 --> 40:27.335
Ha. Still a blow-hard.

40:27.370 --> 40:29.655
But the sack?
There's something in that sack.

40:29.695 --> 40:32.077
–Tell me about Jenna. Is she cute?
–Forget it.

40:32.117 --> 40:35.153
–Just trying to make conversation.
–Forget it!

40:43.240 --> 40:46.070
I don't wanna go home alone tonight.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.610
I'll come over.

40:51.790 --> 40:54.120
He disowned me.

40:54.155 --> 40:56.247
Sorry?

40:56.282 --> 40:58.340
My father.

41:00.670 --> 41:03.140
He disowned me.

41:12.900 --> 41:14.885
Oh, well.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.830
Fathers. Screw 'em.

41:17.865 --> 41:20.160
Damn right.

41:23.430 --> 41:25.760
I'm proud of you, Denny.

41:27.460 --> 41:29.495
For what?

41:29.530 --> 41:32.620
I just am.
I always am.

41:39.990 --> 41:44.016
When you come over tonight,
bring the marshmallows, will 'ya?

41:44.970 --> 41:46.350
Consider it done.
