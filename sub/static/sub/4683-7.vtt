00:19.966 --> 00:21.900
I'll be back!
I'm free!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.700
No!

01:05.600 --> 01:07.933
I had a great time tonight

01:08.000 --> 01:10.233
Night's not over.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.466
Don't push your luck.

01:11.533 --> 01:12.600
Besides,
if my mom wakes up

01:12.666 --> 01:13.633
we're history.

01:13.700 --> 01:14.833
No problem.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.600
If your mom catches us,
you just say you're Merit.

01:17.666 --> 01:19.933
Why do you always
bring her up?

01:20.000 --> 01:22.133
I don't know. I guess
it still freaks me out.

01:22.200 --> 01:23.900
You have an identical twin.

01:23.966 --> 01:25.600
Aren't I enough?

01:25.666 --> 01:28.066
- That depends.
- On what?

01:28.133 --> 01:31.133
On whether or not
you throw me out.

01:31.200 --> 01:33.133
Twenty minutes.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.533
A lot can happen
in twenty minutes.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.100
Mmm.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
'Don't.'

02:43.066 --> 02:45.333
'Okay, stop.'

03:04.800 --> 03:07.500
Seven years bad luck.

03:12.033 --> 03:16.266
- Hey, that hurt.
- What hurt?

03:16.333 --> 03:18.833
Do me a favor, John.
Cut the nails.

03:19.966 --> 03:21.266
Well, just don't play
so rough next time.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.500
I didn't do anything.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.333
It's been 20 minutes.
It's time to go.

03:43.066 --> 03:45.533
Well, come on, let's go.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.933
Let's go.

03:57.166 --> 03:59.366
You didn't have
to wait up for me.

03:59.433 --> 04:02.033
I wasn't waiting.
I got woke up.

04:04.700 --> 04:06.633
'Hey, what happened
to our mirror?'

04:07.566 --> 04:09.100
You know what happened.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.366
Don't start that again.

04:13.433 --> 04:15.900
Sooner or later
you'll believe me.

04:15.966 --> 04:18.033
Believe what? That
Freddy Krueger is alive and well

04:18.100 --> 04:20.200
and living in your dreams?

04:20.266 --> 04:22.200
He killed daddy.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.366
Daddy died 'cause
he couldn't take it anymore.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.800
He killed Freddy,
and he couldn't live with it.

04:30.866 --> 04:33.100
I can, and I know you can too.

04:33.166 --> 04:35.800
It's easy for you.
You're the normal one.

04:35.866 --> 04:38.400
Everyone just thinks
I'm your nutcase twin.

04:38.466 --> 04:40.233
Forget about what they think.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.100
Mom and I care about you.

04:42.166 --> 04:44.033
Mom spends all her time
trying to help you.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.500
I don't want to disappoint her.
I can't help it.

04:46.566 --> 04:49.866
Freddy's there
every time I close my eyes

04:49.933 --> 04:51.533
I don't know
why you don't see him.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.900
I don't see him
'cause I don't believe in him.

04:53.966 --> 04:55.933
Let it go, Merit.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.866
I wish I could be like you

04:58.933 --> 05:01.333
You're my sister,
that's close enough.

05:07.600 --> 05:09.000
He got you.

05:09.066 --> 05:10.300
What?

05:12.066 --> 05:15.066
It was my dream,
and he got you.

05:15.133 --> 05:18.766
The only thing that got me
was an overeager senior.

05:18.833 --> 05:21.033
It's time to go to bed, Merit.

05:38.033 --> 05:39.700
Mmm. Mmm.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.333
Mmm.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.433
Help me!

06:21.700 --> 06:24.033
I don't believe in him.

06:42.666 --> 06:46.766
'Merit, come on, honey,
breakfast is ready.'

06:46.833 --> 06:51.400
'Merit, you sister's got
a headstart on you again.'

06:55.100 --> 06:56.700
What else is new?

07:07.433 --> 07:10.133
Morning, sweety.
Sleep okay?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.400
Sure. Fine.

07:15.966 --> 07:18.466
I'm sorry, honey,
I know I've...been too busy

07:18.533 --> 07:20.800
to really take care of you.
It's just this job.

07:20.866 --> 07:23.233
It takes so much time.

07:24.700 --> 07:27.300
Mom, you don't have to worry
so much about me.

07:27.366 --> 07:31.533
I know. It's just that it's only
been six months since you..

07:33.300 --> 07:35.333
Since I've gotten out
of the hospital?

07:36.433 --> 07:40.133
I'm not very hungry.
See you later.

07:43.033 --> 07:46.266
She'll never get over Freddy
if you don't quit babying her.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.033
I can't just let her
deal with this alone.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.700
I need to spend
more time with her.

07:50.766 --> 07:53.233
More time?
You don't have more time.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.833
You barely have
enough time for...yourself

07:59.966 --> 08:02.300
Honey, try to take care
of her, okay?

08:02.366 --> 08:05.033
Make sure the kids at school
don't tease her.

08:06.466 --> 08:08.466
Just take care
of yourself sometime.

08:08.533 --> 08:12.266
I know.
Just not now, okay?

08:12.333 --> 08:13.433
I love you.
Have a good day.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.800
'Bye.'

08:19.000 --> 08:21.333
There she goes.
The white tornado.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.600
I still make her nervous.

08:30.666 --> 08:33.000
Can you imagine how she'd feel
if you mention Freddy?

08:33.066 --> 08:34.400
She'd lose it.

08:34.466 --> 08:37.400
Don't worry,
I wouldn't say a word.

08:37.466 --> 08:40.333
Anyways, parents
don't understand.

08:43.733 --> 08:45.466
Your neck!

08:45.533 --> 08:47.033
I know.
Pretty freaky, huh?

08:48.900 --> 08:52.566
You're not doing anything funny
to me in my sleep, are you?

08:52.633 --> 08:55.666
How could you say that?

08:55.733 --> 08:57.933
Never mind, just forget it
Let's go.

09:19.633 --> 09:21.733
- Hi.
- Hi, how're you doin'?

09:29.300 --> 09:31.333
Ritzo, to the rescue.

09:31.400 --> 09:32.466
Am I in danger?

09:32.533 --> 09:34.566
Only of being
musically deprived.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.466
Wanna hear my song?

09:36.533 --> 09:37.600
Do I have a choice?

09:37.666 --> 09:40.900
No. Besides I wrote it for you.

09:58.833 --> 10:01.300
Enough.

10:01.366 --> 10:02.866
Pretty good, right?

10:02.933 --> 10:05.733
Top forty, right?

10:05.800 --> 10:08.066
You'll go out with me, right?

10:08.133 --> 10:09.833
You're pretty persistent.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.533
You're pretty resisting.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.266
Perfect match.

10:14.333 --> 10:18.933
What's a cute guy like Ritzo
wasting his time for?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.666
Hey, no offense,
but I mean your sister

10:20.733 --> 10:23.333
isn't exactly the most
stable girl in town.

10:23.400 --> 10:24.766
How long was she locked up

10:24.833 --> 10:26.766
Not as long as you've been
stuffin' your bra.

10:26.833 --> 10:29.333
Bye.

10:35.100 --> 10:36.466
Walk you to class?

10:36.533 --> 10:39.766
You mean, you're not afrai
being seen with me?

10:39.833 --> 10:41.200
The girl who cried Freddy.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.766
You don't look so tough.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.100
You just have this tragic
nobility about you.

10:46.233 --> 10:47.733
You're half right.

10:58.733 --> 11:00.933
That was a good session, Merit.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.866
You're really making progress.

11:02.933 --> 11:06.200
Mr. Seligmann,
that was the most

11:06.266 --> 11:07.633
a guidance counselor could say.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.866
So, sue me.
I got a hangover.

11:09.933 --> 11:11.900
Be in peace, sweety.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.733
You know, it's funny.

11:42.800 --> 11:45.600
First your dad goes nuts
'cause he let Freddy go

11:45.666 --> 11:48.933
and then you go nuts
thinkin' Freddy is back.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.766
How is it like being crazy

11:58.500 --> 12:00.866
Well..

12:00.933 --> 12:02.766
Well, what?

12:02.833 --> 12:04.966
All we learned
is I can look like you.

12:05.033 --> 12:07.000
That we already knew.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.333
The point is confidence,
you need some.

12:12.233 --> 12:13.766
Lisa, I appreciate this

12:13.833 --> 12:17.300
but, number one, dressing like
you will not help my confidence.

12:17.366 --> 12:20.600
And number two, it's not me
I'm having a problem with.

12:20.666 --> 12:23.533
Then what is it?

12:23.600 --> 12:25.066
It's what they think.

12:25.133 --> 12:26.600
People like Alison will always

12:26.666 --> 12:29.366
have an excuse to screw with me.

12:29.433 --> 12:31.100
They think I'm immune.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.400
Forget about Alison.

12:32.466 --> 12:35.366
She's just a stuck up bitch
who likes Jeff Ritzo.

12:35.433 --> 12:36.633
I can't forget about it.

12:36.700 --> 12:39.633
I have to live through it
every single day.

12:39.700 --> 12:41.766
- Live through what?
- Never mind.

12:41.833 --> 12:44.333
You'll never understand what
it is like to be at the bottom.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.700
You're at the top.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.166
Being you isn't so bad.

12:47.233 --> 12:49.166
God knows you get
enough attention.

12:49.233 --> 12:51.500
I'm telling you,
it's all attitude.

12:53.400 --> 12:56.133
Attitude? You be me for a day,
and tell me it's attitude.

13:00.033 --> 13:01.433
Okay, I will.

13:12.766 --> 13:14.133
Not again.

13:16.233 --> 13:18.733
Go back to sleep.
I'll be okay.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.833
Merit, you have to sleep.

13:21.633 --> 13:23.833
I can't.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.933
Not while Freddy's in there.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.933
Oh, give me a break!

14:17.000 --> 14:19.533
Merit, I love you so.

14:34.633 --> 14:39.033
M-M-Mer-r-it,
I need your soul.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.800
'I love you so.'

14:56.866 --> 14:59.700
'I love you so.
I love you so.'

15:06.933 --> 15:08.100
Lisa!

15:09.233 --> 15:10.633
Lisa.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.733
Well, have you seen Freddy

15:42.100 --> 15:45.133
- Merit?
- Yes.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.533
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

15:47.600 --> 15:50.766
- You seen Lisa?
- Oh, she's home, sick today.

15:50.833 --> 15:51.833
Hey.

15:51.900 --> 15:54.166
You wanna have
lunch with me today?

15:54.233 --> 15:56.100
- Wouldn't Lisa mind?
- Hell, no.

15:56.166 --> 15:57.200
She always says that, uh,

15:57.266 --> 15:59.033
you and I should get to know
each other better.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.900
Two timing creep.

16:05.766 --> 16:07.400
Touchy! Touchy!

16:29.433 --> 16:31.233
I love guitar players.

16:32.633 --> 16:35.233
Soliciting in public, Alison?

16:35.300 --> 16:36.733
You've got a big mouth
for a freak.

16:36.800 --> 16:39.333
You better be careful.
Lisa is not here to protect you.

16:39.400 --> 16:40.733
Lay off, Alison.

16:41.766 --> 16:45.100
How chivalrous.
Van Halen to the rescue.

17:09.933 --> 17:12.133
How do you do?

17:13.333 --> 17:14.800
I am Lisa.

17:15.866 --> 17:17.800
I'm so very popular..

17:20.133 --> 17:21.933
...I don't know what to do.

17:42.033 --> 17:43.433
Hi.

17:43.500 --> 17:45.533
I heard you're sick, so
I thought I skip a few classes

17:45.600 --> 17:47.466
come by and see how you were.

17:47.533 --> 17:48.733
Maybe play doctor.

17:54.700 --> 17:57.233
How's that for hello?

17:57.300 --> 17:58.600
Not bad.

18:03.666 --> 18:06.266
If you're really not well,
I'll split.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.100
No, stay.
I want you to.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.866
That's my girl.

18:10.933 --> 18:12.900
Now show Dr. John
where it hurts.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.000
No!

18:51.066 --> 18:52.433
Is it me or what?

18:53.566 --> 18:54.533
What do you mean?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.100
You're not really into this.
Are you?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.933
It's not that.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.033
It's just that, boys never,
I mean, I never..

19:02.100 --> 19:03.933
What are you talkin' about

19:07.300 --> 19:08.800
I'm not Lisa, I'm Merit.

19:15.466 --> 19:19.566
- Cool.
- What?

19:19.633 --> 19:22.900
This is like one of those wild
letters in those magazines.

19:22.966 --> 19:25.166
How I made out with twins
and didn't know it.

19:25.233 --> 19:26.733
This is great!

19:26.800 --> 19:28.233
I think you better go now.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.233
Did you guys plan this or what?

19:31.500 --> 19:34.000
Wow!

19:34.066 --> 19:37.466
Then that was Lisa
I met in school today.

19:37.533 --> 19:39.833
I made a pass at you,
but it was her.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.500
You made a pass at me?

19:42.566 --> 19:45.100
I better get back there and
explain or she's gonna kill me.

19:46.233 --> 19:47.900
Oh, no, please
don't say anything.

19:49.766 --> 19:51.533
Don't worry, I won't.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.200
It just isn't my day.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.366
How dare you?

20:18.433 --> 20:19.633
How could you?

20:19.700 --> 20:22.233
I tried to help you,
and you steal my boyfriend.

20:22.300 --> 20:25.633
I'm sorry. I just wanted to feel
what it's like to be you.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.366
Sure it's not enough that
you have all mom's attention.

20:28.433 --> 20:30.500
You have to take John's too?

20:30.566 --> 20:32.133
No, it wasn't like that.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.233
Then why John?

20:33.300 --> 20:34.566
Jeff Ritzo likes you.

20:34.633 --> 20:36.133
Why don't you go out with him?

20:36.200 --> 20:39.466
It was just the first time
anyone m-mistook me as you

20:39.533 --> 20:41.466
Was also the last time.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.466
From now on,
stay away from my life

20:43.533 --> 20:45.100
and go lead your own.

20:45.166 --> 20:47.233
Let mom baby you herself.

21:29.333 --> 21:30.766
What are you doing here?

21:30.833 --> 21:33.066
I came for you.

21:33.133 --> 21:35.100
I've always
liked you better, Lisa.

21:35.833 --> 21:37.333
But I'm Merit.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.800
No. You're Lisa.

21:39.866 --> 21:41.600
No. That's Lisa.

21:46.733 --> 21:48.966
Let me put it this way.

21:49.033 --> 21:51.300
You will be Lisa,
when Lisa is gone.

21:52.500 --> 21:53.533
Gone?

21:59.433 --> 22:00.833
Gone!

22:02.766 --> 22:03.866
Now do you believe me?

22:03.933 --> 22:05.900
He's in both of our dreams.

22:08.133 --> 22:09.433
Gone!

22:18.133 --> 22:21.200
'But not forgotten.'

22:29.633 --> 22:30.933
Where am I?

22:32.133 --> 22:33.733
This isn't happening.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.166
This isn't real.

22:36.233 --> 22:37.600
'He wants you now.'

22:38.333 --> 22:39.800
Help me!

22:39.866 --> 22:42.033
'You said stay out
of your life.'

22:43.266 --> 22:45.233
Where are you?

22:53.833 --> 22:54.933
Nutcase.

22:56.700 --> 22:58.566
Merit, please!

22:58.633 --> 23:00.633
Let's see how you like it.

23:02.766 --> 23:05.033
Merit, behind you, it's Freddy.

23:05.100 --> 23:07.700
'He'll kill you.'

23:07.766 --> 23:09.800
Let him get me.
You'll wake up the evidence.

23:42.733 --> 23:44.700
Oh, mom!
Thank God.

23:45.966 --> 23:48.666
You were right.
Freddy is back in our dreams.

23:48.733 --> 23:49.866
We've gotta do something.

23:49.933 --> 23:51.400
We've gotta tell someone.

23:51.466 --> 23:52.766
Merit!

23:52.833 --> 23:54.333
What have you done to yourself?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.000
Lisa said you were
having trouble

23:56.066 --> 23:57.133
but this?

23:57.766 --> 23:58.933
Lisa?

23:59.000 --> 24:00.200
I'm Lisa.

24:00.266 --> 24:01.933
W-what are you talking about?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.866
See, mom. She claims to be me.

24:03.933 --> 24:06.466
It's because no one else
will believe her about Freddy.

24:06.533 --> 24:08.166
Now, honey, don't,
don't get upset.

24:08.233 --> 24:09.233
I called the doctor.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.233
I just can't
let you hurt yourself again.

24:11.300 --> 24:14.166
I'm Lisa. She's Merit.

24:14.233 --> 24:16.266
Mom, it's me.

24:16.333 --> 24:17.833
Tell her about Freddy.

24:17.900 --> 24:18.933
Tell her.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.400
Tell her about Freddy.

24:20.466 --> 24:23.000
Mom, please!

24:23.066 --> 24:25.600
'Mom! Help me!'

24:28.433 --> 24:30.733
'Merit!'

24:31.166 --> 24:33.000
'Merit!'

24:33.066 --> 24:34.733
'Merit! Over here.'

24:38.633 --> 24:40.566
Room for one more.

24:48.433 --> 24:50.800
'Merit!'

24:58.966 --> 25:00.233
'I didn't want this for her.'

25:00.300 --> 25:01.766
'But she kept on talking crazy.'

25:01.833 --> 25:03.400
'Kept on about Freddy.'

25:03.466 --> 25:05.733
'Why can't she be more
like her sister Lisa?'

25:06.766 --> 25:09.300
Mom, I am Lisa.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.033
Iam&lt;r

25:14.033 --> 25:16.533
Merit.

25:17.166 --> 25:20.800
Oh, Merit.

25:20.866 --> 25:23.400
Merit!
Psst! Merit!

25:23.466 --> 25:24.800
Over here.

25:24.866 --> 25:26.900
Merit!

25:26.966 --> 25:29.300
Merit.

25:45.633 --> 25:47.300
The drugs,
they're wearing off.

25:48.866 --> 25:50.700
You let them think I was you.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.700
You let them believe
I was crazy.

25:52.766 --> 25:53.966
You were yelling about Freddy.

25:54.033 --> 25:55.000
If I had defended you

25:55.066 --> 25:56.700
they would've drugged us both.

25:56.766 --> 25:58.100
I had to let them
think you were me.

25:58.166 --> 26:00.033
They're used to me being crazy.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.433
There were men
in white coats, and..

26:02.500 --> 26:06.100
No, m-mom just called my regular
doctor, he sedated you.

26:06.166 --> 26:09.200
I had to wait until
we could be alone.

26:09.266 --> 26:10.400
For what?

26:10.466 --> 26:12.600
Now you believe me,
right, about Freddy?

26:12.666 --> 26:13.800
It was just a dream.

26:13.866 --> 26:16.633
You made me dream about him.
It was all your talk.

26:16.700 --> 26:19.200
Are you out of your mind?

26:19.266 --> 26:22.200
How much more
do you have to see?

26:22.266 --> 26:24.033
He's after both of us
in our dreams

26:24.100 --> 26:25.866
because daddy killed him.

26:25.933 --> 26:27.300
Get away from me.

26:29.100 --> 26:30.300
You're causing all this.

26:30.366 --> 26:32.633
Now you're trying
to make me crazy too?

26:32.700 --> 26:35.800
Lisa, please, we have
got to work together.

26:35.866 --> 26:38.066
Together?
I'm sick of being together.

26:38.133 --> 26:39.733
It was bad enough
when you were screaming

26:39.800 --> 26:41.400
about Freddy on your own.

26:41.466 --> 26:43.466
I'm not gonna become like you.

26:43.533 --> 26:46.033
You are like me.
Don't you get it?

26:46.100 --> 26:49.100
We're sisters.
He's after both of us.

26:49.166 --> 26:51.166
Don't ever say
that I'm like you.

26:51.233 --> 26:53.433
I take after mom.
She's strong.

26:54.966 --> 26:57.000
God, I wish I was an only child.

27:04.566 --> 27:05.666
You listen to me.

27:05.733 --> 27:07.966
Our only chance
is to fight him together.

27:08.033 --> 27:11.666
If you reject me, he'll find
your weakness and feed on it.

27:11.733 --> 27:12.900
Stay away from me, Merit.

27:12.966 --> 27:13.900
I'm not like you.

27:13.966 --> 27:14.966
He tried it with me.

27:15.033 --> 27:16.566
He tried to make me
wish I were you

27:16.633 --> 27:18.066
wish you were gone.

27:18.133 --> 27:19.433
Now he'll come for you.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.066
We have got to
be strong together.

27:22.133 --> 27:24.266
I don't believe in Freddy.

27:24.333 --> 27:25.833
You're a liar.

27:37.133 --> 27:39.400
- Mom, can I talk to you?
- Sure.

27:44.666 --> 27:47.100
Mom, I've been
thinking bad things.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.100
Oh, what sort of things?

27:49.166 --> 27:50.800
Things about Merit.

27:50.866 --> 27:54.500
It makes me mad that there's
another me walking around.

27:54.566 --> 27:57.300
That I'll never be,
you know, unique.

27:57.366 --> 27:58.800
What do you mean
things about Merit?

27:58.866 --> 28:02.000
- You are Merit.
- No, mom, I'm Lisa.

28:02.866 --> 28:05.500
Lisa?
Who's Lisa?

28:06.800 --> 28:07.833
Me!

28:07.900 --> 28:09.833
I'm Lisa,
your other daughter.

28:11.600 --> 28:12.833
Lisa?

28:13.600 --> 28:15.833
There is no Lisa.

28:15.900 --> 28:17.933
Just poor sick Merit.

28:23.433 --> 28:24.700
Well..

28:24.766 --> 28:28.300
I guess I'm gonna have to teach
you about what's real, dear.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.000
Merit? Lisa?

28:32.066 --> 28:34.700
Doesn't really matter,
does it?

28:36.333 --> 28:37.966
Does it?

28:38.033 --> 28:40.400
You wanna be an only child?

28:41.233 --> 28:42.600
Do you?

28:50.233 --> 28:52.633
Come to mama!

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
No! No!

29:08.066 --> 29:09.733
Lisa! Lisa!

29:24.433 --> 29:26.066
Do you believe me now?

29:26.133 --> 29:28.100
Or does one of us
have to die first?

29:29.866 --> 29:31.700
You were right from the start.

29:31.766 --> 29:33.566
He got inside my head,
and he knew what I was thinking

29:33.633 --> 29:36.100
about you, all the awful things
that I was thinking about you.

29:36.166 --> 29:37.300
That doesn't matter now.

29:37.366 --> 29:39.700
He knows where
to hit both of us.

29:39.766 --> 29:41.500
Well, what are we
supposed to do?

29:41.566 --> 29:43.633
No one will believe us.
They'll put us away.

29:43.700 --> 29:45.766
We're not gonna tell anyone.

29:45.833 --> 29:48.200
We're gonna do this ourselves.

29:48.266 --> 29:50.800
We're sharing
each other's nightmares.

29:50.866 --> 29:52.700
If he gets you,
I feel it.

29:52.766 --> 29:55.300
And if he gets me,
you feel it.

29:55.366 --> 29:56.933
How are we supposed
to stay alive?

29:58.933 --> 30:00.433
I don't know.

30:28.500 --> 30:30.866
It's been four days.

30:30.933 --> 30:32.433
I can't take it anymore.

30:32.500 --> 30:34.533
You've got to try and hold on.

30:37.366 --> 30:40.066
- What's your next class?
- Calculus.

30:40.133 --> 30:42.300
- What's yours?
- History.

30:43.766 --> 30:45.933
Oh, great. Beller's class.
He'll put anyone to sleep.

30:47.033 --> 30:48.700
I'll hold up,
and so will you.

30:56.966 --> 31:00.466
Any equation that's true
for all of the numbers

31:00.533 --> 31:04.100
in it's domain
is called an identity.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.400
Now, a good way
to prove an identity

31:06.466 --> 31:08.300
is to first start
with the more complicated

31:08.366 --> 31:09.666
'side of the equation.'

31:09.733 --> 31:12.600
'And then re-write it in
the form of the other side.'

31:12.666 --> 31:16.566
Trying to find a sequence
of equivalent expressions.

31:16.633 --> 31:19.233
But if we look at
some of the examples

31:19.300 --> 31:20.900
on the board here

31:20.966 --> 31:22.900
you can see that sometimes

31:22.966 --> 31:25.200
the best way
to prove an identity

31:25.266 --> 31:28.300
'is to work with both sides
of the equation independently.'

31:28.366 --> 31:30.633
Trying to find
a third common expression.

31:30.700 --> 31:34.300
Okay, people, you've all
read pages 100 through 216

31:34.366 --> 31:36.833
and today we're gonna
start our in depth study

31:36.900 --> 31:40.100
of, guess what?
"The American Revolution."

31:40.166 --> 31:42.366
Let's not get too
enthusiastic here.

31:42.433 --> 31:43.900
Uh, the key issue
at the time

31:43.966 --> 31:47.933
and the one issue that was
still relevant to today is..

31:48.000 --> 31:49.900
'Anybody, hands?'

31:49.966 --> 31:51.533
'Not the same hands, thanks.'

31:52.533 --> 31:54.133
'Other hands?'

31:54.200 --> 31:56.100
'Taxation without..?'

31:56.166 --> 31:57.500
Representation.

31:57.566 --> 31:59.033
'Great!'

31:59.100 --> 32:02.733
Now, in this problem right here,
you see we've got sine

32:02.800 --> 32:05.633
'on this side is X.'

32:05.700 --> 32:08.633
'To prove that an equation
is an identity'

32:08.700 --> 32:10.166
'assume that the expressions
on each side'

32:10.233 --> 32:12.100
'of the equal siagn
are equivalent.'

32:12.166 --> 32:14.066
'Then just use
algebraic properties'

32:14.133 --> 32:16.333
'to write equivalent equations
until you have a..'

32:16.400 --> 32:17.533
Oh, no.

32:37.133 --> 32:38.466
'Take this.'

32:38.533 --> 32:40.600
'No running in the halls, Lisa.'

32:45.100 --> 32:46.533
'Up against the wall.'

32:59.666 --> 33:02.100
'So Old King George
imposed these taxes'

33:02.166 --> 33:05.233
not only to line
his own...pockets..

33:08.500 --> 33:10.500
- I couldn't hold on.
- Let's get out of here.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.833
Time out!
Whoa!

33:12.900 --> 33:14.200
Merit, I didn't excuse you

33:14.266 --> 33:16.133
and what are you doing
out of your class?

33:16.200 --> 33:18.733
- Bleeding, you idiot.
- 'Whoa.'

33:21.566 --> 33:23.200
'Can't believe she said that.'

33:23.266 --> 33:24.566
'Hey, where're they going?'

33:25.666 --> 33:27.300
'I wanna go too.'

33:30.366 --> 33:32.300
Uh, King George. Taxation.

33:35.866 --> 33:37.400
He'll kill us at this rate

33:37.466 --> 33:40.100
Sooner or later
one of us will have to sleep.

33:42.733 --> 33:44.766
I know someone who
might be able to help us.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.500
You said we can't tell anybody.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.966
They'll put us away.

33:48.033 --> 33:50.266
We're not gonna tell
the whole story.

33:50.333 --> 33:52.900
We're just gonna
get some information.

33:52.966 --> 33:55.566
- From who?
- From Mr. Seligmann.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.566
He's my guidance counselor

33:57.633 --> 34:00.733
He teaches Psych
and Social Studies.

34:00.800 --> 34:02.833
What makes you think
he can help?

34:02.900 --> 34:04.766
I don't know.
He's from the '60s.

34:04.833 --> 34:06.833
He knows all
types of weird stuff.

34:06.900 --> 34:07.966
God!

34:12.566 --> 34:15.166
So what about
what we've told you?

34:15.233 --> 34:18.800
It's not uncommon for twins
to share dreams, visions.

34:18.866 --> 34:20.166
What about linking up?

34:20.233 --> 34:22.166
You mean having the same dream
at the same time?

34:22.233 --> 34:23.533
No, more than that.

34:23.600 --> 34:25.933
We mean thinking as one person
while we're dreaming.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.366
Woo! That's pretty wild stuff.

34:29.433 --> 34:32.300
Who knows,
if you and your sister

34:32.366 --> 34:35.400
go into sync
while you're dreaming

34:35.466 --> 34:37.533
it could be possible.

34:37.600 --> 34:39.400
So we could go in together?

34:39.466 --> 34:41.366
- Go where?
- Never mind, Mr. Seligmann.

34:41.433 --> 34:44.133
- Thanks for your time.
- Sure, anytime.

35:00.066 --> 35:02.400
These are all set
for an hour from now.

35:02.466 --> 35:04.233
They should wake us up.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.966
They'd better.
A lot can happen in an hour.

35:06.033 --> 35:07.233
I know.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.266
I don't like going in
any more than you do.

35:09.333 --> 35:11.333
But we have to test this.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.600
Now we both have to fall asleep
at the same time.

35:22.300 --> 35:25.333
- I'm scared.
- So am I.

35:26.933 --> 35:28.333
You sure you're up to this?

35:29.300 --> 35:31.233
Don't worry, I'll be there

36:11.066 --> 36:12.600
Lisa!

36:18.300 --> 36:19.800
Lisa!

36:22.266 --> 36:23.633
She left me.

36:24.733 --> 36:26.100
Chicken!

36:27.133 --> 36:29.333
'Merit!'

36:37.566 --> 36:39.533
Lisa!

36:50.200 --> 36:51.600
Lisa.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.500
'Lisa.'

36:54.800 --> 36:55.933
Hey, Merit.

36:57.033 --> 36:59.700
Ever had a man in your
bed before?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.300
Don't worry.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.633
I'll be real gentle.

37:22.533 --> 37:23.833
Real..

37:25.233 --> 37:28.100
Real gentle.

37:33.933 --> 37:35.300
But I won't.

38:00.266 --> 38:01.933
I thought you deserted me.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.166
I thought the same about you.

38:03.233 --> 38:05.566
It just took me a while
to find you.

38:05.633 --> 38:08.066
So, wecango in toget

38:08.133 --> 38:12.466
Yeah. Now we just have
to figure out a way to use it.

38:12.533 --> 38:14.800
He isn't gonna
stay away forever.

38:27.800 --> 38:31.233
Symbiosis, the living together
of two nervous systems

38:31.300 --> 38:33.866
in close association.

38:33.933 --> 38:37.533
I will now demonstrate the
symbiotic relationship of twins

38:37.600 --> 38:40.300
'by introducing
a post-hypnotic suggestion'

38:40.366 --> 38:41.666
'through Lisa and Merit.'

38:41.733 --> 38:44.000
As you know, they have
agreed to be hypnotized

38:44.066 --> 38:46.100
at the beginning of this class.

38:48.900 --> 38:49.933
Lisa.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.000
Yes.

38:51.066 --> 38:53.933
Notice how they answer
as one person.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.466
'While they're in sync'

38:55.533 --> 38:57.733
'they will be able
to see the same things.'

38:58.500 --> 38:59.966
If one believes it

39:00.033 --> 39:02.100
the other one will as well.

39:03.233 --> 39:05.533
I will count to three.

39:05.600 --> 39:06.700
On the count of three

39:06.766 --> 39:08.533
you will open your eyes

39:08.600 --> 39:10.966
and be alone in the classroom.

39:11.033 --> 39:12.733
'All of us will be gone.'

39:13.533 --> 39:17.100
One, two, three.

39:22.066 --> 39:23.700
Do you see anybody?

39:23.766 --> 39:26.133
No. Where'd they all go?

39:28.900 --> 39:31.200
I don't know, but we're
both seeing the same thing

39:31.266 --> 39:32.833
and that's what's important.

39:35.133 --> 39:37.400
Well, what did you see?

39:38.166 --> 39:40.100
We saw the class empty.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.700
Oh, everybody has to read
chapter 8 through 12 by Monday.

39:52.766 --> 39:54.866
- Don't forget.
- Mr. Seligmann..

39:54.933 --> 39:57.300
We both saw the same thing

39:58.900 --> 40:01.500
Of course,
if you are both in sync

40:01.566 --> 40:04.766
you'll both see
and believe the same thing.

40:04.833 --> 40:06.833
It becomes real to both of you.

40:06.900 --> 40:08.766
What if we aren't in sync?

40:08.833 --> 40:11.533
It won't work.
It has to be both of you.

40:12.600 --> 40:14.533
Well, thanks, Mr. Seligmann.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.900
Thank you.

40:20.166 --> 40:21.500
Here we are.

40:24.800 --> 40:26.200
You two okay?

40:27.233 --> 40:28.433
Hello?

40:28.500 --> 40:30.000
What?

40:30.066 --> 40:32.400
Is there something going on
here I should know about?

40:32.466 --> 40:34.400
No, mom.

40:34.466 --> 40:37.133
Why are you two talking
at once all of a sudden?

40:37.200 --> 40:39.733
Oh, I don't know.
It happens sometimes.

40:39.800 --> 40:41.300
It didn't use to happen.

40:41.366 --> 40:43.333
Well, we've been
a lot closer lately.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.033
Well, that's good.

40:45.100 --> 40:47.600
It certainly seems
to be helping Merit.

40:48.666 --> 40:50.333
Lisa's been a big help.

40:50.966 --> 40:52.300
I'm glad.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.566
You two should take care
of each other.

40:54.633 --> 40:55.633
We will.

40:56.733 --> 40:58.666
Here, eat.

40:58.733 --> 41:02.166
We know how to go in together,
but we still have to face him.

41:02.233 --> 41:04.000
- Forever.
- Maybe not.

41:04.066 --> 41:07.166
I think I know a way
we can make him go away.

41:07.233 --> 41:09.333
How? We have to dream.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.333
I know, but we can
help each other control

41:11.400 --> 41:13.433
what we dream about.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.266
I don't understand.

41:15.333 --> 41:17.200
'If we refuse to believe
in Freddy'

41:17.266 --> 41:18.833
refuse to dream about him

41:18.900 --> 41:21.333
he'll vanish.

41:21.400 --> 41:24.766
Like how we dreamt the class
was empty in school today.

41:24.833 --> 41:26.100
Exactly.

41:26.166 --> 41:28.166
Just remember,
the most important part

41:28.233 --> 41:30.600
'is that we do it as
one soul together.'

41:30.666 --> 41:32.433
We have to be in sync.

41:32.500 --> 41:35.733
We have to wish him away
at the same time.

41:35.800 --> 41:37.900
- Okay.
- Okay.

41:41.700 --> 41:43.400
I'll see you inside.

41:43.466 --> 41:44.966
Stay with me.

41:45.033 --> 41:46.333
Always.

42:09.733 --> 42:11.766
Where is he?

42:11.833 --> 42:13.033
Nowhere.

42:13.100 --> 42:15.133
And everywhere.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.266
What is this place?

42:17.333 --> 42:19.000
A basement.

42:19.866 --> 42:21.433
A dungeon.

42:22.733 --> 42:24.400
A boiler room.

42:29.066 --> 42:31.533
Daddy burned him
in a boiler room.

42:33.600 --> 42:34.700
Dream of me

42:34.766 --> 42:37.200
Dream...of me.

42:37.266 --> 42:39.600
Get away from her, you bastard.

42:40.766 --> 42:43.800
Oh, sister-sister.

42:43.866 --> 42:46.933
Sister's keeper.

42:47.933 --> 42:52.000
Ah-h-h!

42:57.466 --> 42:59.633
Lisa, now!

42:59.700 --> 43:01.733
You don't exist.
You're gone.

43:01.800 --> 43:03.900
You don't exist.
You're gone.

43:03.966 --> 43:05.733
You don't exist.
You're gone.

43:05.800 --> 43:08.333
You don't exist.
You're gone.

43:11.533 --> 43:12.933
Ah-h-h!

43:31.300 --> 43:32.600
We did it.

43:32.666 --> 43:34.100
Hey, Lisa!

43:36.233 --> 43:37.400
Lisa?

43:42.500 --> 43:45.733
Hey, we did it.
We made him go away.

43:52.466 --> 43:53.833
What's wrong? You were right.

43:53.900 --> 43:55.400
We made him go away.

43:56.666 --> 43:59.400
It doesn't work.
You can't make him go away.

44:00.166 --> 44:01.900
Ah-h!

44:07.700 --> 44:09.633
'I'm in your safe house?'

44:12.133 --> 44:13.233
Lisa!

44:14.233 --> 44:17.866
Ah! No!

44:25.833 --> 44:27.700
What did you do?

44:27.766 --> 44:30.600
What did you do to your sister?

44:30.666 --> 44:31.833
No. It wasn't me.

44:31.900 --> 44:34.066
We were helping each other.

44:34.133 --> 44:36.000
No, it was Freddy.

44:36.066 --> 44:38.666
Lisa died for me.
It was Freddy.

44:38.733 --> 44:40.700
It was Freddy.

44:48.333 --> 44:49.600
Twins.

44:59.733 --> 45:01.733
Now you can tell 'em apart.
