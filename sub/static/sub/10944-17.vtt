00:01.540 --> 00:04.474
Jack: Rich Wannstedt, how
the heck have you been?

00:04.792 --> 00:07.894
You still runnin' those bronc
riding competitions in Montana?

00:07.962 --> 00:09.696
I'm actually lookin'
to expand up into Alberta.

00:09.764 --> 00:12.498
I could probably come up with a
few names you should talk to.

00:12.567 --> 00:13.567
I want you.

00:13.634 --> 00:14.768
I think it's time

00:14.835 --> 00:16.169
for a new member
of our family.

00:16.236 --> 00:17.370
What are you talkin' about?

00:17.438 --> 00:18.471
(Whispers)
Georgie.

00:18.539 --> 00:20.372
Amy:
Phoenix, hey!

00:20.440 --> 00:22.474
<i>These horses,</i>
<i>they need help.</i>

00:22.542 --> 00:24.409
And what would you want
in return?

00:24.477 --> 00:26.011
Georgie:
You got him back!

00:26.079 --> 00:29.081
Amy: And, you know, you
were right about Kendra.

00:29.148 --> 00:30.182
Told you.

00:30.249 --> 00:32.317
I can spot a nutbar
a mile away.

00:32.384 --> 00:34.186
Rich:
So, Jack, what do you say?

00:34.253 --> 00:35.653
You wanna get back
in the game?

00:35.721 --> 00:38.222
I'm in.
Let's do it.

00:38.290 --> 00:39.323
That's great!

<i>Lou:</i>
<i>Grandpa, wait up!</i>

01:11.354 --> 01:12.755
Look, I know that
you're in a hurry,

01:12.823 --> 01:14.790
but that is no excuse
to skip breakfast.

01:14.858 --> 01:16.626
Jack: Oh, Lou, you don't have
to go to all that trouble.

01:16.693 --> 01:18.027
I'll just get somethin'
at the meeting.

01:18.095 --> 01:19.762
Oh, like what?
A donut? A Danish?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.363
Nothing but empty calories.

01:21.431 --> 01:22.898
With all of these long hours
you've been working

01:22.966 --> 01:27.035
you have to start thinking about
what you're putting into your body.

01:28.004 --> 01:28.937
What is this?

01:29.005 --> 01:30.071
Blueberry protein shake.

01:30.139 --> 01:31.072
And if you know
what's good for you,

01:31.140 --> 01:32.406
you will drink
every last drop.

01:32.474 --> 01:33.374
(Cell phone rings)

01:33.442 --> 01:35.576
Oh... it's not me.

01:35.645 --> 01:37.078
No, it's me.

01:37.146 --> 01:38.146
(Cell phone rings)

01:38.213 --> 01:39.547
Comes with the new job.

01:39.615 --> 01:40.547
Wow.

01:40.615 --> 01:41.715
(Cell phone rings)

01:41.783 --> 01:42.716
You're not gonna
answer that?

01:42.784 --> 01:44.084
Nope.

01:44.152 --> 01:46.920
It's just those guys
wonderin' where I am.

01:46.988 --> 01:48.488
I'll get there
when I get there.

01:48.556 --> 01:50.090
(Cell phone rings)

01:51.660 --> 01:52.660
Have fun.

01:52.727 --> 01:54.361
<i>Jack:</i>
<i>Will do.</i>

01:56.329 --> 01:57.864
Amy:
Good!

01:57.931 --> 02:01.534
All right,
remember to count your strides

02:01.601 --> 02:03.670
and look towards your corner
as you jump.

02:03.737 --> 02:04.771
There we go!

02:08.642 --> 02:10.743
Keep that nice,
even pace.

02:10.811 --> 02:12.811
<i>All right, good.</i>

02:18.051 --> 02:19.751
Great job, Georgie!

02:30.929 --> 02:32.296
<i>Beautiful!</i>

02:33.531 --> 02:35.733
All right,
I'm pretty impressed.

02:35.801 --> 02:38.402
Georgie: Hear that, boy?
She's impressed! Good boy!

02:38.469 --> 02:39.436
Amy: (Chuckles) All
right, you two,

02:39.504 --> 02:40.671
why don't you put
a cooler on him

02:40.739 --> 02:41.505
and I'll meet you out
in the parking lot.

02:41.573 --> 02:43.107
Georgie:
Sure.

02:43.175 --> 02:45.541
Let's go.
(Clicks her teeth)

02:46.310 --> 02:47.643
Good boy!

02:47.712 --> 02:49.245
Hey, pretty soon
we're gonna be putting

02:49.313 --> 02:51.715
first place ribbons
on that stall door!

02:51.782 --> 02:53.016
Hey, good boy.

02:53.084 --> 02:54.951
Olivia:
You're actually not half bad.

02:55.019 --> 02:57.120
It would've been fun jumping
against you on the circuit.

02:57.188 --> 02:58.654
What do you mean
"Would've been?"

02:58.723 --> 03:01.790
Olivia: Look, everybody knows that
foster kids don't hang around for long.

03:01.858 --> 03:03.058
<i>It's just a matter of time</i>

03:03.126 --> 03:04.993
until this family gets bored
of you and kicks you out.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.695
I'm not going anywhere!

03:06.763 --> 03:08.130
We'll see about that.

03:10.566 --> 03:11.767
(Angry sigh)

03:13.236 --> 03:14.603
Jack:
Well, I guess that's it.

03:14.670 --> 03:16.938
We'll talk numbers later
in the week then.

03:17.005 --> 03:18.840
And you'll let us know
about the contract?

03:18.907 --> 03:21.275
Oh, you bet,
soon as I talk to Rich.

03:21.343 --> 03:22.810
You have great day.

03:22.878 --> 03:24.078
Cowboy: You too, Jack.
Good dealin' with ya.

03:24.146 --> 03:27.481
Yeah, and spread that around.
(Chuckles)

03:27.549 --> 03:30.517
Tim: Wow! You're the big man
around town these days.

03:30.585 --> 03:32.552
Somethin' I can
help you with?

03:32.620 --> 03:34.755
Can you spare
a minute?

03:34.822 --> 03:36.289
And by the way,

03:36.357 --> 03:38.591
I'm still not over that little
confab you had with Miranda,

03:38.659 --> 03:40.127
but I'm here
about business.

03:40.194 --> 03:42.462
Well, that's good
'cause I'm in business mode.

03:42.529 --> 03:44.965
Well, I think we should start
gettin' our cows ready for calving.

03:45.032 --> 03:46.867
Fine, we'll order
some supplement.

03:46.934 --> 03:48.367
Well, that's what
I wanna talk to you about.

03:48.434 --> 03:50.202
I got a line on
some high protein feed

03:50.270 --> 03:51.871
at bargain bin prices.

03:51.938 --> 03:54.506
I don't like to skimp
on feed.

03:54.574 --> 03:56.575
You buy cheap,
who knows what's in the stuff.

03:56.643 --> 03:58.310
It's good quality, Jack,
trust me.

03:58.378 --> 03:59.812
(Cell phone rings)

03:59.880 --> 04:02.148
We better stick with
our regular supplier, Tim.

04:02.215 --> 04:03.482
Well, why don't you
hear me out first

04:03.549 --> 04:04.883
before you make up your mind.

04:04.950 --> 04:06.517
I have made up my mind: No.

04:06.585 --> 04:07.952
Hey, Rich.

04:08.020 --> 04:10.554
Yeah, we just parted ways.

04:10.622 --> 04:11.956
<i>Now he's askin' about</i>
<i>these contracts.</i>

04:12.024 --> 04:14.092
Have you had a chance
to look at those yet?

04:16.695 --> 04:17.896
<i>Lou: But I told you
that Georgie's birthday</i>

04:17.963 --> 04:20.964
<i>was coming up weeks ago,</i>
<i>honey.</i>

04:21.031 --> 04:25.468
<i>Well, I'm sure you can</i>
<i>reschedule the appointment...</i>

04:25.536 --> 04:28.571
Fine, then don't.
Just stay in Vancouver.

04:28.639 --> 04:30.073
Yes, Peter,
I am getting upset

04:30.141 --> 04:32.642
because I can't handle
Georgie and Katie alone

04:32.710 --> 04:33.811
all the time!

04:35.646 --> 04:39.115
Well, you know that Georgie
is a handful.

04:40.250 --> 04:43.820
I'm starting to think you're having second
thoughts about this whole adoption.

04:47.190 --> 04:50.559
Yes, yes, I understand your work
is important.

04:51.528 --> 04:52.660
Can you listen?

04:52.728 --> 04:56.298
(Hooves thunder)

05:01.971 --> 05:03.571
(Tires squeal and skid)

05:03.639 --> 05:06.942
(Georgie shouts,
Phoenix whinnies shrilly)

05:07.009 --> 05:08.108
Tim:
Georgie!

05:09.077 --> 05:10.244
Georgie, honey?!

05:11.213 --> 05:12.412
Honey!

05:12.480 --> 05:13.848
Honey, are you okay?

05:13.915 --> 05:15.649
Georgie:
(Grunts)

05:15.717 --> 05:17.551
Tim: Don't, don't move. Get-
just easy now, get up slow!

05:17.618 --> 05:19.220
I'm fine!
I don't need your help!

05:19.287 --> 05:20.587
Tim:
What are you doing,

05:20.655 --> 05:21.588
ridin' in the middle
of the road like that?!

05:21.656 --> 05:23.090
I'm sorry!
I didn't see you!

05:23.158 --> 05:24.623
Well, you could've been hurt!

05:24.691 --> 05:27.460
Well, I wasn't, okay?!
I'm fine! Nothing happened!

05:27.527 --> 05:29.195
Wait...

05:29.263 --> 05:31.097
Now, are you sure
you're okay?

05:31.165 --> 05:32.798
Yes, I'm fine!

05:32.867 --> 05:34.334

Ty: Desi just got out of
surgery about an hour ago.

06:23.814 --> 06:26.349
He's doing really,
really well.

06:26.417 --> 06:27.517
Don't worry,

06:27.584 --> 06:28.683
we'll keep an eye on him
overnight.

06:28.751 --> 06:31.120
Yeah, make sure
he's comfortable.

06:31.187 --> 06:33.188
Okay, Miss Shipton.

06:37.160 --> 06:38.360
- Hey.
- Sorry.

06:38.428 --> 06:40.329
I know you're closed.
I saw your light on.

06:40.397 --> 06:41.763
We're just doing
a late-night surgery.

06:41.831 --> 06:43.065
Is there something
I can help you with?

06:43.133 --> 06:45.400
I spoke to Scott
about picking up some vaccines.

06:45.467 --> 06:46.534
Mr. Williams, right?

06:46.601 --> 06:47.635
That's right.
You can call me Eric.

06:47.702 --> 06:48.869
Eric, I'm Ty.

06:48.938 --> 06:50.871
I've got your order
right here.

06:50.940 --> 06:52.307
Enough West Nile,
strangles,

06:52.374 --> 06:54.309
and rabies vaccines
for 30 horses.

06:54.376 --> 06:56.311
- Looks like you've got a busy day
ahead of you tomorrow. - (Chuckles)

06:56.378 --> 06:59.080
You are tellin' me.

06:59.148 --> 07:01.614
I just bought the McSlade farm
and all the horses with it.

07:01.682 --> 07:02.882
It was a heck of a deal,

07:02.951 --> 07:04.418
but the livestock
was in pretty rough shape.

07:04.485 --> 07:06.320
Most of them haven't
even been vaccinated.

07:06.387 --> 07:08.322
My fiancee actually worked
with Kendra McSlade.

07:08.389 --> 07:11.558
She tried to help her with
some of her horses, but...

07:11.625 --> 07:13.026
Kendra is a little...

07:13.094 --> 07:15.429
Cuckoo?
Nuttier than a fruitcake?

07:15.496 --> 07:17.430
I was gonna say reluctant,
but yeah.

07:17.497 --> 07:19.265
Eric: Maybe your fiancee can
help me out with something.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.566
According to
the livestock inventory

07:20.633 --> 07:22.301
I got from the lawyer,

07:22.369 --> 07:23.970
there's a missing horse.

07:24.037 --> 07:26.439
Registered name was
"Sky's The Limit"?

07:26.506 --> 07:28.841
<i>It's a grey gelding.</i>

07:28.908 --> 07:30.109
Hmm...

07:32.211 --> 07:33.378
Well, I can't get a hold
of Kendra,

07:33.446 --> 07:35.546
so if your fiancee
knows anything,

07:35.614 --> 07:37.382
I'd be grateful.

07:37.450 --> 07:38.483
Okay.

07:40.353 --> 07:41.386
Thanks.

07:48.826 --> 07:49.693
Lou:
(Sighs)

07:49.760 --> 07:51.095
Katie finally fell asleep,

07:51.162 --> 07:53.797
so I think I'm gonna
head to bed.

07:53.865 --> 07:55.966
It's early.
Is everything okay?

07:56.034 --> 07:57.401
Yeah.

07:58.870 --> 08:00.604
No.

08:00.671 --> 08:02.439
Me and Peter had this
huge argument today

08:02.507 --> 08:03.940
and I just can't stop
thinking about it.

08:04.008 --> 08:05.241
What happened?

08:05.309 --> 08:07.410
He's gonna miss
Georgie's birthday next week

08:07.478 --> 08:09.578
and I kind of lost it.

08:09.646 --> 08:10.980
I probably overreacted,

08:11.048 --> 08:14.350
but it's her first birthday
with us and I just...

08:14.418 --> 08:15.985
I wanted it
to be memorable,

08:16.053 --> 08:19.055
and it will be,
just minus Peter.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.422
Do you remember,
when we were growing up,

08:20.490 --> 08:21.756
how many cards we got
in the mail from Dad

08:21.824 --> 08:23.625
on our birthday?

08:23.692 --> 08:25.127
Ten years worth.

08:25.194 --> 08:26.861
Yeah, and I would've sent
every one of them back

08:26.929 --> 08:28.363
just to have him there.

08:28.431 --> 08:29.898
Yeah, me too.

08:30.866 --> 08:32.366
I know what's happening
with Peter

08:32.434 --> 08:33.701
isn't the same thing,

08:33.769 --> 08:37.038
but I can understand
why you'd be upset.

08:37.105 --> 08:39.740
Thanks. Good night.

08:39.807 --> 08:41.241
Good night.

08:43.544 --> 08:45.079
(Cell phone rings)

08:51.319 --> 08:52.352

Ty, hey.

08:52.420 --> 08:53.853
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Amy,</i>

08:53.921 --> 08:55.588
what was Phoenix's name
before he came to Heartland?

08:55.656 --> 08:57.524
Um, Sky's The Limit.

08:57.591 --> 09:00.160
Did Kendra give you
a bill of sale for him?

09:00.227 --> 09:01.394
Um...

09:01.462 --> 09:03.495
Not exactly, why?

09:03.563 --> 09:04.796
Do you have any proof
that you own him?

09:04.864 --> 09:06.798
Well, I helped her re-home
a few horses,

09:06.866 --> 09:08.266
and in exchange
she gave me Phoenix.

09:08.301 --> 09:10.936
It was just more
of a verbal agreement.

09:11.003 --> 09:12.604
<i>Why are you asking me this?</i>

09:12.672 --> 09:15.307
Kendra sold her farm to a guy
named Eric Williams,

09:15.375 --> 09:17.409
but not just the farm,
the livestock too,

09:17.477 --> 09:19.710
and Eric was just in here
a couple of minutes ago

09:19.778 --> 09:21.579
and he was asking
about Phoenix.

09:21.646 --> 09:23.781
Okay, well,
I'll call Kendra in the morning

09:23.848 --> 09:25.149
and get this worked out.

09:25.217 --> 09:26.417
Good idea.

09:26.485 --> 09:27.851
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

09:27.919 --> 09:30.254
<i>Amy: Yeah, yeah, thanks.
Love you.</i>

09:30.322 --> 09:32.156
Bye.
(Phone beeps off)

09:43.267 --> 09:44.935
Tim:
Hey, Jack,

09:45.003 --> 09:46.604
<i>i've been runnin' around</i>
<i>all morning.</i>

09:46.671 --> 09:48.906
I fixed the fence up
by the dude ranch.

09:48.974 --> 09:51.307
Oh, and I chopped some firewood
for you too, okay?

09:51.374 --> 09:52.709
Hey...

09:52.776 --> 09:54.844
Got you a coffee
while I was at McDonalds.

09:54.912 --> 09:58.715
You never bring me coffee.
What do you want?

09:58.782 --> 10:00.182
I wanna show you
something.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.485
Yeah, I can see that feed tote
plain as day.

10:02.552 --> 10:04.621
I said yesterday
I wasn't interested.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.855
I just want you to look at it
with your own eyes

10:06.923 --> 10:09.725
so you know
it's good stuff.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.159
The only reason
it was cheap

10:11.227 --> 10:12.894
is because it tested
a little high for moisture,

10:12.962 --> 10:14.863
but that's okay 'cause
we're gonna use it right away.

10:14.931 --> 10:16.297
You get what you pay for, Tim.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.133
I only raise
high quality cattle,

10:18.200 --> 10:20.168
which means usin'
high quality feed.

10:20.236 --> 10:21.469
Tim:
That's funny.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.504
That's funny considerin'
I've been the one

10:22.571 --> 10:24.171
raising all the cattle lately,

10:24.239 --> 10:26.520
while you've runnin' around
glad-handing for your new job.

10:26.574 --> 10:27.742
Well, good.

10:27.809 --> 10:28.976
About time
you pulled your weight.

10:29.044 --> 10:30.444
Take that feed back
to wherever it came from

10:30.512 --> 10:33.014
and we're done talkin'
about this.

10:33.081 --> 10:34.949
Thanks for the coffee.

10:37.819 --> 10:39.786

Olivia's Dad: Come on, I spent

I want a picture.

10:50.898 --> 10:52.331

You have such a pretty smile.</i>

10:52.399 --> 10:54.000

<i>Olivia's Mom: We're heading

11:01.307 --> 11:02.675
<i>Do you want anything?</i>

11:02.742 --> 11:04.710
Amy:
Okay, Georgie?

11:04.778 --> 11:05.978
I just want you
to really focus

11:05.979 --> 11:07.012
on your position
going in and out

11:07.080 --> 11:08.180
of the jumps today,
okay?

11:08.247 --> 11:09.715
Okay.

11:09.783 --> 11:11.382
I just felt yesterday
that, you know,

11:11.449 --> 11:12.984
<i>you were leaning forward</i>
<i>a little bit,</i>

11:13.052 --> 11:16.788

11:17.790 --> 11:19.423

11:19.491 --> 11:21.258
Yup, let's do this.

11:25.998 --> 11:27.297
(Rails clatter)

11:28.465 --> 11:29.900
(Laughing)
Ho!

11:29.967 --> 11:33.436
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>Remember to count your strides!</i>

11:35.740 --> 11:37.107
Olivia:
(Laughs)

11:38.442 --> 11:40.310
Georgie:
(Sighs in frustration)

11:40.377 --> 11:41.778
<i>Amy: And try to be
consistent, Georgie!</i>

11:41.846 --> 11:43.679
<i>Olivia:</i>
<i>(Laughs)</i>

11:45.115 --> 11:46.281
I hate you!

11:47.718 --> 11:49.384

11:49.452 --> 11:50.652
<i>I'm gonna rip your eyes out</i>
<i>and shove 'em in your ears</i>

11:50.721 --> 11:51.921
so you're deaf and blind!

11:51.988 --> 11:53.723
Amy:
Georgie, what are you doing?!

11:53.790 --> 11:54.790
Psycho!

11:54.858 --> 11:56.158
Spoiled brat!

11:56.226 --> 11:58.960
You have got to learn
to control your temper!

11:59.028 --> 12:00.294
If you can't deal with Olivia
in practice,

12:00.362 --> 12:02.463
how are you gonna manage
in competition?

12:02.531 --> 12:04.132
- I wanna go home.
- No, we're not done here.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.160
Georgie:
Yeah, well I am!

12:05.201 --> 12:06.234
Georgie!

12:14.182 --> 12:15.816
<i>Tim: Not like Jack
to miss dinner.</i>

12:16.401 --> 12:18.102
Lou: Yeah, well, he is
at a cocktail party

12:18.170 --> 12:21.105
drumming up business
for Rich.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.405
Tim:
Hmm.

12:22.474 --> 12:24.140
A cocktail party?

12:24.208 --> 12:25.408
Oh, I can just see that now,

12:25.477 --> 12:26.997
Jack standing by
the chocolate fountain

12:27.011 --> 12:28.645
sippin' an apple-tini.

12:28.713 --> 12:30.514
Lou and Tim:
(Chuckle)

12:31.483 --> 12:33.183
May I be excused?

12:33.250 --> 12:35.552
You hardly touched
your food.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.287
Well...

12:37.355 --> 12:39.622
I'm not feeling
so good.

12:39.690 --> 12:41.090
Lou:
What's the matter?

12:41.157 --> 12:43.726
Nothing,
just tired.

12:43.794 --> 12:44.894
Okay, well,
go lay down

12:44.962 --> 12:46.161
and I'll come check on you
in a minute.

12:46.229 --> 12:47.262
Okay.

12:51.034 --> 12:52.702
Was Georgie okay
at practice today?

12:52.769 --> 12:55.837
Actually, there was sort
of an incident.

12:55.905 --> 12:56.905
What kind of an incident?

12:56.906 --> 12:58.039
She had a bad run

12:58.107 --> 13:00.375
and then she just
stormed off.

13:00.442 --> 13:02.362
Tim: You gotta to find a
way to control that kid.

13:02.378 --> 13:04.112
If I didn't have
lightning fast reflexes

13:04.179 --> 13:05.847
I would have run over her
with my truck.

13:05.915 --> 13:08.216
Lou: What? Run her
over with your truck?

13:08.283 --> 13:09.717
You didn't get
my message.

13:09.784 --> 13:11.018
What message?

13:16.491 --> 13:19.092
(Knocking at door,
door opens)

13:19.995 --> 13:22.362
Is there something
you wanna talk to me about?

13:22.430 --> 13:24.064
About what?

13:24.132 --> 13:26.293
Lou: Why would you ride across
the road without looking?

13:26.299 --> 13:27.500
You know better than that.

13:27.568 --> 13:29.435
It's totally no big deal!
Nothing happened!

13:29.503 --> 13:30.870
Lou:
But it could have.

13:30.938 --> 13:32.271
And then instead of being
honest with me,

13:32.339 --> 13:34.774
you erased my dad's message.

13:34.842 --> 13:36.609
I didn't want you to worry.

13:36.677 --> 13:38.144
Lou:
Well, you know what?

13:38.211 --> 13:41.113
You're plan was a bust
because I am worried.

13:41.181 --> 13:44.215
Honey,
what were you thinking?

13:45.117 --> 13:47.318
Georgie, look at me.

13:49.923 --> 13:51.156
Fine.

13:51.223 --> 13:52.591
No more riding Phoenix alone.

13:52.659 --> 13:53.692
But-

13:53.760 --> 13:55.594
You can practice jumping
with Amy, but that's it,

13:55.662 --> 13:57.429
and no TV for two weeks.

13:57.496 --> 13:58.963
And when you've cooled off,

13:59.031 --> 14:01.766
an apology for erasing
that message would be nice.

14:01.833 --> 14:04.134
Sorry I'm such a "handful."

14:05.336 --> 14:07.004
What did you say?

14:07.072 --> 14:08.973
Nothing.

14:18.382 --> 14:20.850
- Hey.
- Hey!

14:20.918 --> 14:24.621
You know, every email I've sent
to Kendra has bounced back.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.122
Did you try
her cell?

14:26.190 --> 14:28.625
Yes, it's not working.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.826
She's completely MIA.

14:30.894 --> 14:32.327
If I can't get a hold of her,

14:32.395 --> 14:35.731
I have no way of proving
that Phoenix belongs to me.

14:35.799 --> 14:38.000
Well, I don't think
you should have to prove it.

14:38.068 --> 14:39.835
Kendra gave you Phoenix.
He's your horse.

14:39.903 --> 14:42.270
Yeah, but not on paper.

14:43.607 --> 14:44.940
(Sighs)

14:45.008 --> 14:46.641
Eric has probably got
his hands full

14:46.675 --> 14:48.610
at the McSlade farm.

14:48.677 --> 14:50.511
Maybe we just don't
say anything

14:50.579 --> 14:51.779
and he forgets about it.

14:51.847 --> 14:53.481
Ty, no.

14:53.548 --> 14:54.716
Come on,
I can't do that.

14:54.783 --> 14:56.684
- I know.
- It'd be dishonest.

14:56.719 --> 14:57.852
(Sighs)

15:00.956 --> 15:04.925
You could lose Phoenix.
Georgie would be devastated.

15:07.128 --> 15:09.262
I don't think
I have any other choice.

15:17.471 --> 15:19.138
(Lou Hums quietly)

15:31.984 --> 15:34.019
(Sighs)

15:42.461 --> 15:43.694
(Sighs)

15:55.407 --> 15:58.141
Grandpa, you are not gonna
believe what I just found.

15:58.209 --> 15:59.509
What is it?

15:59.577 --> 16:01.344
I was putting laundry away
in Amy's room,

16:01.412 --> 16:02.646
minding my own business,

16:02.713 --> 16:04.414
when I could not help
but notice this.

16:04.482 --> 16:06.183
You were snoopin'.

16:06.250 --> 16:08.618
Snooping is a very loaded word,
Grandpa.

16:08.686 --> 16:11.988
Like I said,
I was putting laundry away.

16:14.157 --> 16:17.059
<i>Jack: "Neptune's Palace
Hotel, Las Vegas."</i>

16:17.126 --> 16:18.126
So what?

16:18.195 --> 16:21.163
So read this part
right here.

16:22.899 --> 16:26.268
"Amenities include:
Starfish mini golf,

16:33.108 --> 16:35.109
God,
can you believe this?

16:35.177 --> 16:36.110
Believe what?

16:36.178 --> 16:37.745
Isn't it obvious?

16:37.813 --> 16:39.480
Ty and Amy are eloping.

16:39.548 --> 16:43.318
Oh, Lou, stop jumpin'
to conclusions.

16:43.385 --> 16:46.520
There is a rational explanation
for this.

16:46.588 --> 16:47.721
Like what?!

16:47.788 --> 16:49.423
I don't know.
Put it back in Amy's room,

16:49.490 --> 16:50.724
forget you ever saw it,

16:50.791 --> 16:53.727
'cause nothin' good
ever comes from snoopin'.

16:53.794 --> 16:57.431
I was not snooping.
I was putting laundry away.

17:09.876 --> 17:10.809
Amy: Okay, Georgie,
remember to look!

17:10.877 --> 17:12.144
(Rail clatters)

17:12.212 --> 17:14.179
Okay, go deep

<i>Find your distance.</i>

17:17.182 --> 17:18.415

17:20.653 --> 17:22.119
Georgie:

17:22.186 --> 17:24.521
Amy: You don't suck.
Just remember to breathe.

17:24.589 --> 17:26.190
What is wrong with me?

17:26.259 --> 17:27.925
There's nothing wrong with you,
Georgie.

17:27.992 --> 17:29.527
You're just thinking
too much.

17:29.595 --> 17:30.962
I can tell that
you're tensing up

17:31.029 --> 17:32.130
<i>every time</i>
<i>you approach a jump.</i>

17:32.197 --> 17:34.064
I'm not doing it

17:34.132 --> 17:37.501
I know, I know.
I'm just trying to help, okay?

17:37.569 --> 17:38.902
<i>You know, maybe this</i>
<i>has something to do</i>

17:38.970 --> 17:41.171
<i>with your accident.</i>

17:41.239 --> 17:43.407
My dad said he came pretty close
to hitting you,

17:43.475 --> 17:45.208
and maybe you're holding on
to that fear.

17:45.277 --> 17:47.311
Or maybe...

17:47.379 --> 17:48.145
I just suck!

17:48.212 --> 17:49.111
Georgie...

17:49.179 --> 17:50.480
Face it, Amy,

17:50.547 --> 17:52.114
I'm not good enough
to ride this horse!

17:52.182 --> 17:55.385
Maybe you should give Phoenix to
someone who can actually jump!

17:56.353 --> 17:58.388
Georgie, don't say that.

18:05.395 --> 18:06.995
(Cell phone rings)

18:08.164 --> 18:09.398
Tim:
You gonna answer that?

18:09.465 --> 18:10.899
Jack:
No, I'm not.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.534
It's just Rich.

18:12.602 --> 18:14.763
He's callin' about some guy
that needs to be schmoozed,

18:14.804 --> 18:17.606
or some contract
that needs to be signed,

18:17.674 --> 18:20.208
or rough stock
that needs to be transported.

18:20.276 --> 18:21.842
Tim: Sounds like you're
gettin' tired of it, Jack.

18:21.910 --> 18:23.511
Jack: Well, I like
the job well enough.

18:23.578 --> 18:26.314
It's just a little more work
than I thought it'd be.

18:26.381 --> 18:28.015
Tim: Guess that's why I haven't
seen you out here for awhile.

18:28.082 --> 18:29.750
Jack: Yeah, it's keepin'
me busy, that's for sure.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.018
Doesn't mean
I'm any less committed

18:31.085 --> 18:32.586
to runnin' this operation.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.887
Tim:
Well, you can't do everything.

18:33.955 --> 18:35.189
You know, eventually something's
gonna give.

18:35.256 --> 18:36.523
A man at your age...

18:36.590 --> 18:40.126
I suggest you not finish
that sentence.

18:40.194 --> 18:41.961
What do we have here?

18:44.832 --> 18:47.033
(Cows moo in the distance)

18:49.603 --> 18:51.070
Looks like
Stumpy's brand.

18:51.138 --> 18:52.338
Yeah.

18:52.405 --> 18:54.005
What's it doin'
out here?

18:54.073 --> 18:55.507
I don't know.

18:55.575 --> 18:57.710
I've been keepin' up
the fences.

18:57.777 --> 18:59.845
Sometimes one of them
slips through.

18:59.912 --> 19:04.350
I don't see any blood.
I don't think it was wolves.

19:04.417 --> 19:06.385
I better call Stumpy.

19:08.187 --> 19:09.887
Are you sure
you don't want anything?

19:09.955 --> 19:11.389
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:11.457 --> 19:13.991
Not even
a chocolate sundae?

19:14.059 --> 19:15.593
I won't tell Lou.

19:15.661 --> 19:17.027
No thanks.

19:17.095 --> 19:18.629
(Cell phone rings)

19:21.367 --> 19:24.268
Hello?

19:24.336 --> 19:25.535
Mr. Williams.

19:26.471 --> 19:28.171
Yeah, no, thank you
for calling me back.

19:28.239 --> 19:29.840
Could you hold on
one moment?

19:29.907 --> 19:30.974
Thanks.

19:31.976 --> 19:33.777
Here.
Order something, okay?

19:33.845 --> 19:35.912
I'll be right back.

19:35.980 --> 19:37.848
Hey, sorry about that.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.883
Mallory: Hey, Georgie,
what'll it be?

19:39.950 --> 19:42.351
How about Olivia's head
on a stick?

19:42.419 --> 19:43.952
I don't think
that's on the menu.

19:44.020 --> 19:46.856
Seriously, she is like
the meanest girl I've ever met!

19:46.923 --> 19:48.858
And, of course,
she's got the perfect parents

19:48.925 --> 19:50.158
<i>and the perfect horse,</i>

19:50.226 --> 19:51.761
the perfect hair.

19:51.828 --> 19:52.995
<i>Mallory: I used to
know girls like that</i>

19:53.062 --> 19:54.162
and you wanna know a secret
about them?

19:54.230 --> 19:55.297
What?

19:55.365 --> 19:57.131
They're usually not so perfect.

19:57.199 --> 19:59.166
Well, Olivia is.

19:59.234 --> 20:00.502
You don't know that.

20:00.569 --> 20:02.404
She's probably got
a hairy mole on her back

20:02.471 --> 20:04.038
or so much wax in her ears

20:04.106 --> 20:07.341
that she could start
a candle business.

20:08.310 --> 20:11.479
Girls like Olivia feed off of
making other people miserable,

20:11.547 --> 20:14.882
because they're so miserable
themselves.

20:18.352 --> 20:20.788
Lou: That was a good bite.
Hey, how was practice?

20:20.855 --> 20:22.155
Georgie:
I still suck!

20:22.223 --> 20:23.590
Amy: You don't suck.
Stop saying that.

20:23.658 --> 20:25.125
You're just having some
minor setbacks, that's all.

20:25.192 --> 20:26.152
Tomorrow will be better.

20:26.193 --> 20:27.260
Listen to your coach.

20:27.328 --> 20:28.728
She knows what
she's talking about.

20:28.796 --> 20:29.829
Amy:
(Sighs)

20:31.799 --> 20:34.967
So, I was catching up with
an old friend earlier today.

20:35.035 --> 20:36.702
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

20:36.770 --> 20:38.203
Turns out that her
and her fiance

20:38.271 --> 20:39.639
eloped last year.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.027
They got married
in Atlantic City.

20:41.041 --> 20:43.375
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:43.444 --> 20:45.243
And now she totally
regrets it,

20:45.311 --> 20:48.413
because she wasn't able to share
her special day with her family,

20:48.481 --> 20:49.981
<i>not to mention the fact</i>
<i>that she missed out</i>

20:50.049 --> 20:51.917
<i>on getting to register</i>
<i>at a high end department store.</i>

20:51.984 --> 20:53.251
You know,
believe it or not,

20:53.319 --> 20:54.686
there comes a time
in every woman's life

20:54.754 --> 20:57.322
where she wants a matching set
of overpriced good china

20:57.389 --> 20:58.523
and a bread maker.

20:58.591 --> 21:00.425
I'll keep that in mind.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.926
Hey, can I talk to you
about something?

21:01.993 --> 21:03.794
Yeah, sure,
what is it?

21:03.862 --> 21:05.696
(Quietly)
Phoenix.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.432
I think there might be a problem
with his ownership papers.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.533
What?

21:09.601 --> 21:10.734
<i>Amy:</i>
<i>(Sighs) Yeah.</i>

21:10.802 --> 21:11.869
I'll explain everything
to you later,

21:11.937 --> 21:14.772
but do you think
you could do me a favour?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.139
Okay.

21:16.207 --> 21:19.476
Just keep Georgie inside
for the next hour or so?

21:19.543 --> 21:21.644
Should I be worried?

21:21.712 --> 21:24.347
I'll take care of it,
I promise.

21:48.237 --> 21:49.704
You must be Amy Fleming?

21:49.771 --> 21:52.272
Yes. Hi, Mr. Williams,
it's great to have you here.

21:52.340 --> 21:54.300
I appreciate you telling me
about Sky's The Limit,

21:54.309 --> 21:56.110
or should I say
Phoenix Rising?

21:56.177 --> 21:58.613
I just wanted to be
totally up front with you.

21:58.680 --> 22:00.715
Phoenix has been living here
for the past eight months,

22:00.782 --> 22:01.883
and I have to say

22:01.950 --> 22:04.218
he's really become
part of the family.

22:04.285 --> 22:05.819
I'd really like
to take a look at him.

22:07.655 --> 22:09.489
Amy:
That's him there.

22:11.425 --> 22:13.493
Oh, he's beautiful.

22:13.561 --> 22:15.294
Yeah, there's this girl,
Georgie,

22:15.362 --> 22:16.863
that we're adopting
into the family,

22:16.931 --> 22:19.165
she usually rides Phoenix.

22:19.233 --> 22:20.599
They have quite
the connection.

22:20.667 --> 22:23.402
It would really
be a shame if...

22:23.469 --> 22:26.005
I think there's been some
kind of a misunderstanding.

22:26.072 --> 22:27.806
See, I'm not here
to take Phoenix away.

22:27.874 --> 22:29.274
You're not?

22:29.342 --> 22:30.910
No, I wanted to make sure
he had a decent home,

22:30.977 --> 22:34.379
and it's pretty obvious
that he's in good hands.

22:34.447 --> 22:37.415
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.651
You know I should be
the one thanking you.

22:39.718 --> 22:42.053
Most of Kendra's horses,
they're in pretty rough shape.

22:42.120 --> 22:43.922
One less to worry about
is a big help.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.990
I know it'll mean
a lot to Georgie.

22:46.058 --> 22:48.026
Her and Phoenix are getting
so good at jumping

22:48.093 --> 22:51.095
and they're a great team.

22:51.163 --> 22:53.363
I didn't realize that
Phoenix was a jumper.

22:53.431 --> 22:55.198
Well, yeah,
they're having some challenges

22:55.266 --> 22:56.426
with their training
right now,

22:56.467 --> 22:58.669
but I know they have
a lot of potential.

22:58.736 --> 23:00.170
He's a great horse.

23:00.237 --> 23:01.271
In that case,

23:01.338 --> 23:02.539
I'd like to see him
jump sometime.

23:02.607 --> 23:04.441
Yeah, we're just training
up at a local arena.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.242
You could stop by
anytime.

23:06.310 --> 23:07.410
I might just do that.

23:07.478 --> 23:08.678
Okay.

23:15.953 --> 23:17.386
Ty: Hey, guys, I've
been looking for you.

23:17.454 --> 23:18.454
You got a sec?

23:18.521 --> 23:20.322
Jack:
Oh, sure, sit down.

23:21.124 --> 23:22.491
Um...

23:24.194 --> 23:25.359
I probably shouldn't be
saying anything,

23:25.427 --> 23:27.195
but um...

23:27.262 --> 23:29.263
Do you remember that dead bull
that you guys found?

23:29.331 --> 23:30.765
Yup.

23:30.833 --> 23:33.301
Well, when Scott went back
and checked on Stumpy's herd,

23:33.368 --> 23:35.737
he found that one of the cows
was kinda...

23:35.805 --> 23:37.839
Sick and wobbly.

23:37.907 --> 23:39.240
Now nothing's for sure
until those test results

23:39.308 --> 23:41.742
come back from the lab...

23:45.279 --> 23:47.014
(Whispers)
But Scott thinks it's BSE.

23:47.082 --> 23:49.116
You gotta be kiddin' me.

23:50.251 --> 23:52.019
If I were you,
I would keep all your cattle

23:52.087 --> 23:54.822
on the Heartland side
of the fence.

23:54.889 --> 23:57.657
If those test results
come back positive,

23:57.725 --> 24:01.293
Stumpy's entire ranch
is gonna be quarantined.

24:01.361 --> 24:03.696
Okay, now please
don't tell anyone.

24:03.764 --> 24:05.231
This all could be nothing.

24:05.298 --> 24:07.100
I don't want anyone
to worry.

24:07.167 --> 24:09.368
So if we can just keep
this between us?

24:09.436 --> 24:12.704
Oh, we will.
Thanks for the heads up.

24:14.007 --> 24:15.007
<i>Ty:</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

24:15.074 --> 24:18.043
<i>I should probably get going.</i>

24:18.111 --> 24:19.444
See you, guys.

24:22.849 --> 24:24.482
That's all we need.

24:26.019 --> 24:28.886
(Quietly) "Mad Cow disease"
back in the headlines.

24:28.954 --> 24:30.220
(Cell phone rings)

24:30.288 --> 24:32.523
Are you gonna get that?

24:32.590 --> 24:34.224
I'll be back.

24:38.730 --> 24:40.164
Hey, Rich.

24:42.300 --> 24:44.434
Tim: (Whistles) Hey, Ty,

24:48.405 --> 24:50.640
I got a question for you.

24:50.708 --> 24:51.675
Ty:
What's up?

24:51.742 --> 24:54.177
Okay, what if,
hypothetically,

24:54.244 --> 24:56.646
a rancher bought some feed
from Stumpy

24:56.714 --> 24:58.347
and fed it to his herd?

24:58.415 --> 25:00.750
What might happen
if the test results

25:00.818 --> 25:03.319
come back positive
for BSE.?

25:04.254 --> 25:06.389
Did you buy some
of Stumpy's feed?

25:06.456 --> 25:07.390
Because if you did-

25:07.457 --> 25:09.858
Just answer the question.

25:12.262 --> 25:13.396
Okay.

25:13.463 --> 25:16.699
If they trace
the spread of...

25:16.766 --> 25:17.899
(Quietly) If they trace
the spread of the disease

25:17.966 --> 25:19.100
back to the feed,

25:19.168 --> 25:20.968
then any cattle
that will have eaten it

25:21.036 --> 25:24.406
will be quarantined...
and then culled.

25:37.924 --> 25:38.991
<i>Amy: Whatever's going
on with Georgie,</i>

25:39.059 --> 25:40.293
it has nothing to do
with Phoenix.

25:40.360 --> 25:42.027
He's in perfect form.

25:42.095 --> 25:43.829
<i>Ty: Maybe she just had
a bad couple of days.</i>

25:43.897 --> 25:45.797
Amy:
No, she used to be fearless.

25:45.864 --> 25:48.933
Something's happened
to make her lose her confidence.

25:49.001 --> 25:50.968
Ty: Well, what about that
near accident with Tim?

25:51.036 --> 25:54.172
Amy: Uh, yeah, you know,
I thought so at first,

25:54.240 --> 25:57.942
but there's a girl who climbed
down a well to save a dog.

25:58.110 --> 25:59.944
Not much scares her.

26:00.012 --> 26:02.112
Ty: Well, I'm sure
you'll figure it out.

26:02.180 --> 26:04.548
Georgie will be sailing over
those jumps in no time.

26:04.616 --> 26:06.216
(Sighs)
I hope so.

26:07.218 --> 26:09.520
Hey, I've been thinkin'.

26:09.587 --> 26:11.988
Now that this whole thing
with Eric is behind us,

26:12.056 --> 26:15.091
maybe we can make
a decision about Vegas?

26:16.761 --> 26:20.663
I haven't decided yet,
but I am leaning towards yes.

26:22.366 --> 26:23.800
Really?

26:23.867 --> 26:25.267
Yeah. I still have
some things

26:25.336 --> 26:27.269
to work out here,
but...

26:27.338 --> 26:29.205
I wanna do it.

26:37.513 --> 26:40.281
Jack: Yeah, Stumpy, I appreciate
that you called to tell us,

26:40.350 --> 26:41.983
and I know I speak
for everyone here,

26:42.051 --> 26:46.321
we'll keep our fingers crossed
that it's not BSE.

26:49.225 --> 26:51.959
Say that again?
What feed?

26:55.397 --> 26:59.667
No, Tim did not
tell me that.

27:02.203 --> 27:05.005
Yeah, no, that's uh...

27:06.674 --> 27:08.341
All right.

27:11.311 --> 27:13.346
(Phone beeps off)

27:33.266 --> 27:35.834
(Loud crash)

27:45.544 --> 27:48.946
(Sharp click,
rustling sounds)

27:57.388 --> 27:59.856
Amy:
Is everything all right?

27:59.924 --> 28:03.627
Georgie: Yeah, I just
can't sleep, I guess.

28:03.694 --> 28:05.896
What are you hiding there?

28:13.537 --> 28:15.571
These are your parents?

28:16.973 --> 28:19.809
They look like
really nice people.

28:19.876 --> 28:21.544
I don't remember.

28:21.611 --> 28:24.146
I was really young
when they died.

28:24.213 --> 28:28.683
Usually I just make stuff up
about them in my head.

28:28.751 --> 28:30.351
What kind of stuff?

28:31.320 --> 28:33.521
You know, stories.

28:36.258 --> 28:37.959
<i>Like...</i>

28:38.026 --> 28:39.193
There was this one time,

28:39.261 --> 28:40.862
it was after practice

28:40.930 --> 28:44.598
and my dad really wanted
a photo of Phoenix and I,

28:45.633 --> 28:47.233
and I didn't feel like it,

28:47.301 --> 28:50.403
but then he said that
the horse cost him a fortune

28:50.472 --> 28:52.639
<i>and he deserved a picture.</i>

28:52.707 --> 28:55.609
Then my mom kept telling me
to smile,

28:55.677 --> 28:57.177
and my dad was like,

28:57.244 --> 29:00.145
"Oh, yeah,
that cost me a fortune too."

29:01.147 --> 29:03.649
That's a pretty good story.

29:03.717 --> 29:05.150
Nah, it's stupid.

29:07.521 --> 29:09.021
Somebody else's life.

29:09.990 --> 29:12.124
Georgie...

29:12.192 --> 29:15.760
<i>I know that Lou and Peter</i>
<i>aren't your real parents,</i>

29:15.828 --> 29:17.529
but they love you a lot.

29:17.597 --> 29:21.099
I heard them fighting about me
over the phone.

29:21.166 --> 29:25.370
It sounded like Peter didn't
want to adopt me anymore.

29:25.437 --> 29:27.271
<i>Olivia was right.</i>

29:27.339 --> 29:29.540
I don't think that's true.

29:30.509 --> 29:31.542
(Sighs heavily)

29:31.610 --> 29:33.611
It's okay, Amy.

29:33.678 --> 29:37.381
I'm used to adults making
promises they can't keep.

29:37.448 --> 29:40.484
<i>You're all really nice people</i>

29:40.552 --> 29:43.921
and you don't have anything
to feel bad about.

29:43.989 --> 29:46.022
Can we go to sleep now?

29:48.025 --> 29:49.392
Yeah.

29:52.429 --> 29:53.963
(Crows caw)

29:55.365 --> 29:56.900
<i>(Hammering)</i>

30:05.274 --> 30:06.808
Jack...

30:06.876 --> 30:08.143
There's somethin'
I gotta get off my chest.

30:08.210 --> 30:09.377
You're not gonna like it.

30:09.445 --> 30:11.079
Yeah, well, you can
save your breath.

30:11.147 --> 30:14.315
I already know
you went behind my back.

30:14.383 --> 30:16.018
Okay, I made a mistake.

30:16.085 --> 30:18.653
No! I told you
not to buy that feed!

30:18.720 --> 30:19.787
I told you twice!

30:19.855 --> 30:22.757
I take full responsibility,

30:22.824 --> 30:24.158
but even if it is BSE,

30:24.225 --> 30:26.326
you know the chances
of that food being the source

30:26.394 --> 30:27.528
are slim to none.

30:27.596 --> 30:29.630
You went behind my back.

30:30.966 --> 30:33.967
It's supposed
to be partnership, Jack.

30:34.035 --> 30:35.602
We make decisions together,

30:35.670 --> 30:37.437
<i>but that's pretty tough to do</i>
<i>when you're not around.</i>

30:37.504 --> 30:39.205
That's good,
comin' from a guy

30:39.273 --> 30:41.274

in Moose Jaw!

30:41.341 --> 30:42.842
Tim:
Well, that won't be an issue

30:42.910 --> 30:44.778
now that you've ruined
my relationship with Miranda.

30:44.845 --> 30:45.979
Jack: Yeah, well, I
wouldn't take back

30:46.047 --> 30:48.548
a single word
I said to her either.

30:49.616 --> 30:51.149
Tim:
All right, hold on.

30:51.217 --> 30:52.818
Hold on!

30:52.886 --> 30:54.152
I'll make it up to you, Jack.

"You'll make it up to me."

everything will be gone!

<i>Hey.</i>

32:00.857 --> 32:02.590
Mallory,
what're you doing here?

32:02.657 --> 32:04.859
I was thinking about
your Olivia situation

32:04.926 --> 32:06.594
and I saw something
at the tack shop

32:06.661 --> 32:09.764
that I thought
you should have.

32:13.101 --> 32:14.602
Oh my gosh,
thank you!

32:15.570 --> 32:16.970
Sometimes the best way
to stick it

32:17.038 --> 32:17.970
to a girl like Olivia

32:18.038 --> 32:19.171
is to feel extra fabulous,

32:19.239 --> 32:20.874
and with a riding belt
like that

32:20.941 --> 32:23.777
you're gonna be asking
yourself: Olivia who?

32:23.844 --> 32:25.077
Thanks, Mallory.

32:25.145 --> 32:26.413
Don't mention it.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.114

32:55.441 --> 32:58.776
Hey, Jack,
I have some news.

33:00.178 --> 33:03.781
Stumpy's herd tested
negative for BSE.

33:03.849 --> 33:05.082
It turns out
that wobbly cow

33:05.150 --> 33:08.418
just had some complications
with calving,

33:08.486 --> 33:12.789
and that bull you found,
it died of pneumonia.

33:15.426 --> 33:16.726
You okay?

33:17.695 --> 33:18.662
I thought you might
be relieved.

33:18.729 --> 33:23.131
Oh, I am.
Believe me, I am,

33:23.199 --> 33:27.235
and thank you for keeping me
in the loop.

33:28.304 --> 33:31.340

33:32.642 --> 33:35.644

Catch you later.

Amy:
All right, Georgie,

33:49.959 --> 33:51.526
you've done this
a hundred times, all right?

33:51.594 --> 33:53.894
You know the course
so don't overthink it.

to watch.

34:06.340 --> 34:08.241
The last thing I need
is everybody watching me

34:08.309 --> 34:09.943

Amy: Georgie, they don't

34:13.714 --> 34:16.516
Lou:
Georgie, where are you going?

34:27.927 --> 34:29.860
Amy told me about
what you said last night.

34:29.929 --> 34:31.596
Well, Amy has a big mouth.

34:31.664 --> 34:34.799
Peter is not having second
thoughts about adopting you.

34:34.867 --> 34:36.568
I heard you on the phone.

34:44.708 --> 34:45.743
I was mad at Peter

34:45.810 --> 34:47.445
and I wanted to make him
feel bad

34:47.513 --> 34:50.081
so I said something
I shouldn't have,

34:50.149 --> 34:51.382
but it wasn't fair of me

34:51.449 --> 34:52.969
to accuse him
of having second thoughts

34:52.984 --> 34:55.953
<i>because he's not, Georgie.</i>

34:56.021 --> 34:58.821
<i>He wants to adopt you</i>
<i>just as much as I do.</i>
