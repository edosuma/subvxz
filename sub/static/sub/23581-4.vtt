00:09.320 --> 00:12.600
COMPERE: And now, returning to
competition after some years away,

00:12.640 --> 00:15.920
all the way from
the Stuart-Hargreaves Dance Studio in
Bicester,

00:15.960 --> 00:19.720
couple number seven:
Frederick and Winifred Thursday.

00:19.760 --> 00:21.160
(Applause)

00:22.080 --> 00:24.080
(Tango music continues)

00:25.120 --> 00:27.120
<font color="#ffff00">Here's looking at you.</font>

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074

00:42.560 --> 00:44.960
The motion before this house is:

00:45.000 --> 00:47.960
"This house believes in an end to
immigration

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
and the repatriation of
all settled immigrants to their
ancestral lands."

01:02.240 --> 01:06.760
<font color="#ffff00">This motion is not about the colour</font>
<font color="#ffff00">of one's skin.</font>

01:06.800 --> 01:11.560
<font color="#ffff00">It is about national resources</font>
<font color="#ffff00">stretched to breaking point</font>

01:11.600 --> 01:16.000
<font color="#ffff00">by an influx of immigrants</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to this green and pleasant land.</font>

01:28.120 --> 01:32.120
It is well to be careful
who we designate an immigrant.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.960
The black man has been here
a lot longer than the Angle,

01:35.000 --> 01:37.000
the Saxon, the Jute...

01:38.360 --> 01:41.320
..the Norman, the Huguenot.
(Laughter)

01:41.360 --> 01:45.880
Long before many of your forefathers
walked
"this green and pleasant land",

01:45.920 --> 01:49.360
it was the Nubian who stood watch
on Hadrian's Wall.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.640
The motion before this esteemed house
calls for

01:51.680 --> 01:55.640
all settled immigrants
to return to their ancestral lands.

01:55.680 --> 02:00.880
So, that being the case,
I have to say, "After you."

02:00.920 --> 02:03.120
(Ripples of laughter and applause)

02:56.680 --> 02:58.120
<font color="#ffff00">The regiment!</font>

02:58.160 --> 02:59.960
ALL: The regiment!

03:05.760 --> 03:07.400
<font color="#ffff00">WOMAN: That's her!</font>

03:07.440 --> 03:09.440
(Angry shouting)

03:10.920 --> 03:12.920
(Booing)
MAN: Disgraceful!

03:13.960 --> 03:15.960
(Jeering continues)

03:17.280 --> 03:19.240
(Booing and angry chatter)

03:19.280 --> 03:21.560
<font color="#ffff00">MAN: Get out, you racist!</font>

03:21.600 --> 03:24.360
(Camera shutter clicks)
You go back!

03:24.400 --> 03:25.480
<font color="#ffff00">Nazi lover!</font>

03:26.520 --> 03:27.760
Oh!

03:27.800 --> 03:30.680
(Cheering)
<font color="#ffff00">White enough now, eh?</font>

03:30.720 --> 03:32.320
(Camera shutter clicks)

03:32.360 --> 03:34.640
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's with me. She's with me.

03:34.680 --> 03:37.320
<font color="#ffff00">MAN: A disgrace!</font>
<font color="#ffffff">That's what you get!</font>

03:37.360 --> 03:41.320
<font color="#ffff00">You're mad. Do you want to get</font>
<font color="#ffff00">arrested?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">What are you... What are you doing?</font>

03:41.360 --> 03:44.360
<font color="#ffff00">What am I going to do with you?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">What are you going to do with me?</font>

03:48.960 --> 03:50.960
<font color="#ffff00">Regional quarters.</font>

03:51.000 --> 03:53.040
<font color="#ffff00">Semi-finals next, Fred.</font>

03:53.080 --> 03:54.680
<font color="#ffff00">Don't put them there.</font>

03:54.720 --> 03:57.920
I won't put 'em there. When's that?

03:58.960 --> 04:00.640
<font color="#ffff00">September.</font>

04:01.680 --> 04:04.320
<font color="#ffff00">And we'll need to look to it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if we want to make the finals.</font>

04:04.360 --> 04:07.280
Well, it's finding time.
<font color="#ffff00">You'll have the time, won't you?</font>

04:07.320 --> 04:10.880
<font color="#ffff00">You've done your bit, Fred, and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">more.</font>

04:10.920 --> 04:12.920
<font color="#ffff00">If anyone deserves a rest...</font>

04:15.200 --> 04:17.200
(Birdsong)

04:34.800 --> 04:36.760
(Whirring)

04:38.400 --> 04:40.000
(Giggles)

04:42.720 --> 04:44.720
(Pop song in French)

04:58.800 --> 05:00.680
(Volume of song decreases)

05:02.480 --> 05:04.480
(Indistinct chatter)

05:04.520 --> 05:08.080
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks. All right, thanks.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Yes, all right, that's fine.</font>

05:22.920 --> 05:24.920
(Drill sergeant calls out
in distance)

05:26.400 --> 05:28.200
<font color="#ffff00">Left!</font>

05:29.280 --> 05:30.880
Ah, Thursday.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.720
<font color="#ffff00">Sir.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">As you were. As you were.</font>

05:34.760 --> 05:38.960
I want three volunteers to escort
a civilian party up to High Wood at
1100.

05:39.000 --> 05:42.200
They're from a fashion magazine,
I believe. <font color="#ffff00">I'll do it, sir.</font>

05:42.240 --> 05:44.560
Very well. Pick two other men from
your section.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.680
Carry on, Corporal Thursday.

06:01.200 --> 06:04.520
<font color="#ffff00">Anything?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">All quiet on the Western.</font>

06:04.560 --> 06:08.400
The word is out for Cromwell Ames
from here
to Brum and all points else.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.640
Not a peep. Not a whisper.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.560
<font color="#ffff00">What about Eddie Nero?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Lying low.</font>

06:12.600 --> 06:14.960
If there is a term for it, it's "gone
underground".

06:15.000 --> 06:16.840
<font color="#ffff00">Lull before the storm, maybe?</font>

06:20.000 --> 06:24.400
Hey, what happened to you this
morning? That's the third day in a
row a stranger's brought me in.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.080
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, something came up.</font>

06:26.120 --> 06:29.000
Everything all right now, is it?
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, yeah, fine.</font>

06:29.040 --> 06:30.640
Lunch?
<font color="#ffff00">I can't today.</font>

06:30.680 --> 06:34.400
<font color="#ffff00">I've got statements to take from</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this fracas</font>
<font color="#ffff00">outside the debating society.</font>

06:34.440 --> 06:36.240
Oh, right.

06:36.280 --> 06:38.760
Well, fair enough.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.240
(Indistinct shouted orders)

06:47.280 --> 06:51.720
One! Two! Three!
<font color="#ffff00">Corporal Thursday!</font>

06:51.760 --> 06:54.760
<font color="#ffff00">What is that long-haired poof</font>
<font color="#ffff00">doing on my parade ground?</font>

06:54.800 --> 06:57.400
He's got a pass, sir.
<font color="#ffff00">What bloody pass?</font>

06:57.440 --> 07:00.400
Oh, my eye! Would you look at that?

07:04.240 --> 07:07.880
<font color="#ffff00">At about three o'clock in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">afternoon,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the right horn of the Zulu Impi</font>

07:07.920 --> 07:11.320
<font color="#ffff00">debouched from a dry stream-bed</font>
<font color="#ffff00">west of Colonel Stewart's position</font>

07:11.360 --> 07:15.840
<font color="#ffff00">and made a sustained attack upon the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">laager</font>
<font color="#ffff00">lasting the best part of an hour,</font>

07:15.880 --> 07:19.640
<font color="#ffff00">before being repulsed by</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Lieutenant Burnaby's bayonet charge.</font>

07:23.240 --> 07:25.680
<font color="#ffff00">Your attention, gentlemen, if you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">would.</font>

07:25.720 --> 07:28.040
<font color="#ffff00">This is for your benefit.</font>

07:31.960 --> 07:33.960
(Indistinct chatter and laughter)

07:39.480 --> 07:43.160
I've been given to understand that
some sort of private area would be
desirable

07:43.200 --> 07:44.920
to serve as a makeshift dressing
room.

07:44.960 --> 07:47.000
<font color="#ffff00">Just somewhere for the girls to get</font>
<font color="#ffff00">changed.</font>

07:47.040 --> 07:50.080
H3, one of the buildings we use for
exercises, should suffice.

07:51.120 --> 07:53.920
It's fairly spartan,
but the best we can do, I'm afraid.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.960
Well, I imagine you're keen to get on
with your picture taking.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
<font color="#ffff00">Cool.</font>

07:59.040 --> 08:01.520
<font color="#ffff00">Now, come on, girls, not here. Get</font>
<font color="#ffff00">back in.</font>

08:01.560 --> 08:03.880
(Psychedelic rock music)

08:05.800 --> 08:09.520
(Camera shutter clicks)
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, Jean. Lovely.</font>

08:09.560 --> 08:12.320
<font color="#ffff00">Great. All right.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Give me something more in the arm.</font>

08:12.360 --> 08:14.840
(Shutter continues clicking)
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I like that.</font>

08:15.680 --> 08:17.680
(Music continues on radio)

08:17.720 --> 08:23.600
A canny good skive is this call,
stood watching tarts slip in and out
their clobber.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.720
So, gan on, which one do you fancy
best?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.960
I've got my eye on that one on the
tank.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.240
Jean, her name is.
<font color="#ffff00">How do you know that?</font>

08:32.280 --> 08:35.080
She does that perfume ad, what is it?
<font color="#ffff00">Ooh.</font>

08:35.120 --> 08:38.720
All right. What are you horrible lot
staring at?
You never seen a woman before?

08:38.760 --> 08:41.039
<font color="#ffff00">Not like that, Colour.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Eyes front.</font>

08:41.080 --> 08:44.400
I know what your lot are like.
<font color="#ffff00">And what are "my lot" like, Colour?</font>

08:44.440 --> 08:48.360
Just keep your dirty, heathen mind
above the equator, or you'll have my
sticky end.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.160
<font color="#ffff00">Beautiful. All right, Jean. That's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">great, love.</font>

08:51.200 --> 08:54.360
<font color="#ffff00">Next change, please. Give her a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hand. </font><font color="#ffffff">Yeah.</font>

08:54.400 --> 08:56.400
<font color="#ffff00">Howay.</font>

08:58.600 --> 09:00.640
Do you always work with that
photographer?

09:00.680 --> 09:02.880
<font color="#ffff00">Thankfully, not always.</font>

09:03.920 --> 09:06.880
It must be interesting seeing the
world and getting paid for it.

09:06.920 --> 09:08.520
<font color="#ffff00">It's no different to you.</font>

09:08.560 --> 09:12.920
We're off to Germany in a couple of
days. It's the first time we've been
out the country.

09:14.280 --> 09:18.080
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it's all shooting, right?</font>

09:21.800 --> 09:24.480
<font color="#ffff00">You are sweet, soldier boy.</font>

09:33.880 --> 09:38.880
<font color="#ffff00">No, I know what you want, but I'm</font>
<font color="#ffff00">spoken for.</font>

09:50.240 --> 09:52.480
So, Mr Hutchens,

09:52.520 --> 09:57.400
you were part of this reception
committee that assaulted Lady
Bayswater last night.

09:57.440 --> 09:59.680
<font color="#ffff00">Her sort deserve all they get.</font>

09:59.720 --> 10:02.400
"Her sort"?
<font color="#ffff00">She's a Fascist.</font>

10:02.440 --> 10:04.560
Isn't that just everybody
who disagrees with you?

10:04.600 --> 10:09.000
<font color="#ffff00">Charity Mudford was interned in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Holloway during the war under</font>
<font color="#ffff00">defence regulation 18B.</font>

10:10.000 --> 10:11.920
<font color="#ffff00">You've heard of her old man,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">presumably?</font>

10:12.960 --> 10:15.840
<font color="#ffff00">The late Viscount? The Lord</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Bayswater?</font>

10:15.880 --> 10:18.440
<font color="#ffff00">The leading light in the British</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Union of Fascists.</font>

10:19.040 --> 10:21.560
<font color="#ffff00">For Christ's sake, Hitler danced at</font>
<font color="#ffff00">their wedding!</font>

10:21.600 --> 10:23.600
<font color="#ffff00">I think she qualifies.</font>

10:25.600 --> 10:27.680
Yes. Super.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.600
OK. One more.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.240
Think of Warren Beatty. Fabulous.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.000
Right, that's us finished, then.

10:36.040 --> 10:40.280
<font color="#ffff00">Very good, sir. Got everything you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">need? </font><font color="#ffffff">Yes, thanks. Just pack up and</font>
<font color="#ffffff">be on our way.</font>

10:40.320 --> 10:41.880
<font color="#ffff00">Collier.</font>

10:45.840 --> 10:48.400
FARRIDGE:
Hold on, Jean. You're wonderful.

10:48.440 --> 10:51.200
All right, come on, Suki. Make
yourself useful.

10:54.840 --> 10:57.280
(Pop music plays on radio in
background)

10:57.320 --> 10:59.320
<font color="#ffff00">Le flic.</font>

10:59.360 --> 11:01.560
<font color="#ffff00">Move, stupid, you're in the sun.</font>

11:06.400 --> 11:08.560
Is that better?
<font color="#ffff00">Uh-huh.</font>

11:08.600 --> 11:10.600
(Both laugh)

11:10.640 --> 11:12.720
(Sighs)
<font color="#ffff00">I got lunch.</font>

11:12.760 --> 11:14.480
(Chuckles)

11:18.800 --> 11:21.720
What have you been doing?
<font color="#ffff00">I told you, I got lunch.</font>

11:21.760 --> 11:23.760
What else?
<font color="#ffff00">Like what?</font>

11:23.800 --> 11:25.400
Like work?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.920
<font color="#ffff00">Some story the agency want me to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">cover.</font>

11:27.960 --> 11:30.840
<font color="#ffff00">Some coiffurier.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">I thought you didn't do fashion?</font>

11:30.880 --> 11:32.480
<font color="#ffff00">I don't.</font>

11:32.520 --> 11:34.200
<font color="#ffff00">(Giggles)</font>

11:39.040 --> 11:40.640
(Turns music off)

11:42.760 --> 11:44.760
<font color="#ffff00">(She giggles)</font>

11:47.640 --> 11:50.200
All right, girls.
<font color="#ffff00">Ready?</font>

11:50.240 --> 11:51.920
Just a minute.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.360
<font color="#ffff00">Sorry, Corp, call of nature.</font>

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
Now what?

12:33.440 --> 12:36.640
Everything all right?
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, I'm sorry, we're just waiting</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on Jean.</font>

12:36.680 --> 12:39.720
<font color="#ffff00">She forgot something.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I said I'd pick her up here on the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">way out.</font>

12:39.760 --> 12:42.280
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe she misunderstand</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and went back to the village.</font>

12:45.760 --> 12:47.760
(Indistinct shouts)

12:49.120 --> 12:51.720
Jean? Jean!

12:53.960 --> 12:56.160
<font color="#ffff00">LIEUTENANT CARMICHAEL:</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Got something!</font>

12:57.000 --> 12:58.400
<font color="#ffff00">Here!</font>

13:17.080 --> 13:18.880
Miss Ward?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.600
Jean?

13:46.720 --> 13:50.560
The body of a young woman has been
discovered on Ministry of Defence
land.

13:50.600 --> 13:53.480
Details are thin, but she appears to
have been a civilian.

13:53.520 --> 13:55.840
<font color="#ffff00">Right, sir. Whereabouts is this?</font>

13:55.880 --> 13:58.480
The army barracks up at High Wood.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.680
Your son's there, isn't he?
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, sir.</font>

14:02.720 --> 14:05.240
In light of which, I think,

14:05.280 --> 14:08.840
given the potential delicacy of the
situation...

14:09.880 --> 14:12.720
..it would be best to confine
your operational involvement

14:12.760 --> 14:15.800
to a more managerial role,
here at the station.

14:15.840 --> 14:17.840
<font color="#ffff00">Of course, sir.</font>

14:18.680 --> 14:20.800
Morse knows him, doesn't he, your
son?

14:20.840 --> 14:24.640
But he's not family. I see no reason
to keep him from the investigation.

14:24.680 --> 14:27.280
It'll be all right, I'm sure.

14:56.960 --> 15:01.480
<font color="#ffff00">This is Murder Town, Chief</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Superintendent. It's used by the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">regiment for exercises.</font>

15:01.520 --> 15:04.440
<font color="#ffff00">House-to-house fighting, sniping,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that kind of thing.</font>

15:04.480 --> 15:06.480
<font color="#ffff00">The police, Colonel.</font>

15:09.440 --> 15:11.040
Colonel Champion CO.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.680
My 2-IC Major Coward.

15:12.720 --> 15:17.000
<font color="#ffff00">Chief Superintendent Bright, Thames</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Valley, Detectives Sergeant Strange</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and Morse,</font>

15:17.040 --> 15:19.040
<font color="#ffff00">and Detective Constable Fancy.</font>

15:19.080 --> 15:23.160
Obviously, this is your show but
please bear in mind, this is an
operational barracks

15:23.200 --> 15:24.840
for the next 48 hours, at least.

15:24.880 --> 15:26.480
<font color="#ffff00">48 hours?</font>

15:26.520 --> 15:29.520
We're readying for deployment.
In two days, we leave for Germany

15:29.560 --> 15:33.040
and the regiment, as many of us
have known and loved it, will cease
to exist.

15:33.080 --> 15:36.960
Now, there are live firing areas
and final exercises still in
progress,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.520
so your men should not wander
unattended.

15:39.560 --> 15:42.480
<font color="#ffff00">Understood.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Excellent. Shall we?</font>

15:44.000 --> 15:48.160
Now, the girl's body was found in H5,
the building just down here.

15:58.960 --> 16:01.840
<font color="#ffff00">Doctor.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Gentlemen.</font>

16:01.880 --> 16:03.440
<font color="#ffff00">Do we have a name for her?</font>

16:03.480 --> 16:08.680
Jean Ward, according to the
photographer.
Died within the last four hours.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.960
So far as I can tell, we have a
single stab wound through the back,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
most likely penetrated the heart.

16:15.840 --> 16:19.920
No sign she attempted to defend
herself. <font color="#ffff00">Taken unawares, then?</font>

16:19.960 --> 16:22.720
What had she lost? Did she say?

16:22.760 --> 16:25.280
<font color="#ffff00">A purse. I found it in the woods,</font>

16:25.320 --> 16:28.320
<font color="#ffff00">whereupon I split the search party</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to cover more ground,</font>

16:28.360 --> 16:30.960
<font color="#ffff00">with orders to rendezvous here at</font>
<font color="#ffff00">1630.</font>

16:31.000 --> 16:35.280
Well, we'll need to speak to all of
them. <font color="#ffff00">We've set aside one of the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">classrooms.</font>

16:35.320 --> 16:38.920
Who found the body? <font color="#ffff00">Oh, that was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Lance Corporal Thursday.</font>

16:55.760 --> 16:57.840
What's all this about, Major Coward?

16:57.880 --> 16:59.480
<font color="#ffff00">Police.</font>

16:59.520 --> 17:01.520
What are they doing on the base?

17:01.560 --> 17:03.560
<font color="#ffff00">Policing.</font>

17:07.960 --> 17:09.960
What happened to you last night?

17:10.000 --> 17:12.000
Never came home.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.040
This Frenchy piece, is it?

17:14.079 --> 17:17.079
What's her line, then?
<font color="#ffff00">Photojournalist.</font>

17:17.119 --> 17:19.839
Figures.
<font color="#ffff00">How's that?</font>

17:19.880 --> 17:24.160
Well, let's face it, with you, it was
never gonna be Doreen from the corner
shop, was it?

17:24.200 --> 17:27.440
Bit of all right, is she?
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, I suppose. She's just a girl.</font>

17:27.480 --> 17:32.480
Just a girl? You want to leave some
for the rest of us. Claudine, that
blondey one.

17:32.520 --> 17:36.320
The way you've been filling your
dance card,
you'd think rationing was coming in.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.720
<font color="#ffff00">She's good company.</font>

17:38.920 --> 17:41.800
So how are we gonna run this
without the old man?

17:41.840 --> 17:44.800
<font color="#ffff00">You're senior.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Who would you like to see first?</font>

17:49.720 --> 17:51.720
What's that?

18:03.360 --> 18:05.360
<font color="#ffff00">It looks to be a cap badge.</font>

18:05.400 --> 18:07.720
One of the squaddies, then, sir.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.720
<font color="#ffff00">After we split up,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I came down to the wash house.</font>

18:13.760 --> 18:16.760
<font color="#ffff00">I thought maybe she might have had</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to use the ladies.</font>

18:17.960 --> 18:23.640
<font color="#ffff00">I called for her, but there was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">nobody there, so I er...made my way</font>
<font color="#ffff00">back to Murder Town.</font>

18:25.680 --> 18:27.400
I worked my way back from the tank
park.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.960
<font color="#ffff00">Mm-hm. </font><font color="#ffffff">Thought we could've missed</font>
<font color="#ffffff">her in the woods.</font>

18:30.000 --> 18:31.320
They're big enough, like.

18:31.360 --> 18:35.360
She could've gone back to
our original rendezvous.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.320
But I didn't see anything.
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>

18:37.360 --> 18:40.280
I dunno what else I can tell you.
I should've been watching her.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.520
<font color="#ffff00">You haven't got eyes in your arse.</font>

18:42.560 --> 18:45.720
<font color="#ffff00">All right, that'll be it for now.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Do you wanna whistle up an escort?</font>

18:45.760 --> 18:47.360
Maybe YOU could.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.480
<font color="#ffff00">Two minutes.</font>

18:56.840 --> 19:00.640
Right, so if there's anything you've
left out, now would be the time.

19:00.680 --> 19:02.360
<font color="#ffff00">She was in my care.</font>

19:02.400 --> 19:05.960
<font color="#ffff00">If I'd done my job...</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Sam, things happen.</font>

19:06.000 --> 19:08.600
The only person responsible for this
is whoever did it.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.600
<font color="#ffff00">You've been around Dad too long.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">It's rubbing off.</font>

19:13.480 --> 19:15.280
All right.

19:16.680 --> 19:19.440
<font color="#ffff00">How is he?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Oh, how do you think?</font>

19:20.680 --> 19:24.000
Any messages for him? <font color="#ffff00">Just tell him</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I'm all right, if that's allowed.</font>

19:24.040 --> 19:25.840
<font color="#ffff00">And Joanie, if you see her.</font>

19:34.920 --> 19:37.560
There's not much more we can do
with the light that's left.

19:37.600 --> 19:40.280
We'll have a full team out first
thing, fingertip search.

19:40.320 --> 19:43.360
Sergeant Major Davies,
I need this area secured until 0430.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.920
Nobody in or out without my
authorisation.

19:45.960 --> 19:47.880
<font color="#ffff00">Very good, sir.</font>

19:50.640 --> 19:53.840
And had you photographed her before?
<font color="#ffff00">A few times over the years.</font>

19:53.880 --> 19:55.880
<font color="#ffff00">Actually, I got her started.</font>

19:55.920 --> 19:58.520
<font color="#ffff00">We did a campaign for</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the Egg Marketing Board.</font>

19:58.560 --> 20:00.560
<font color="#ffff00">She was the Soft-Boiled Girl.</font>

20:02.200 --> 20:06.120
Your relationship was purely
professional, though?

20:06.160 --> 20:10.360
<font color="#ffff00">We saw each other at parties,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">gallery openings, things like that.</font>

20:10.400 --> 20:13.920
What DS Morse is asking is,
were you knocking her off?

20:13.960 --> 20:15.440
<font color="#ffff00">No. No.</font>

20:16.400 --> 20:19.040
<font color="#ffff00">I mean...not lately.</font>

20:19.080 --> 20:21.320
<font color="#ffff00">We had a brief number,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but strictly casual.</font>

20:21.360 --> 20:24.160
What was she like, in her
personality?

20:25.080 --> 20:27.480
<font color="#ffff00">Nice. Crazy.</font>

20:27.520 --> 20:29.160
<font color="#ffff00">Mixed-up, I suppose.</font>

20:29.200 --> 20:31.520
About what?
<font color="#ffff00">Who knows?</font>

20:31.560 --> 20:33.480
What about boyfriends?

20:33.520 --> 20:37.720
<font color="#ffff00">She had a few, but nobody serious.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Any connection to Oxford?</font>

20:37.760 --> 20:40.160
<font color="#ffff00">Her stepmother has a place out this</font>
<font color="#ffff00">way, I believe.</font>

20:40.200 --> 20:43.400
Stepmother? <font color="#ffff00">It's not something she</font>
<font color="#ffff00">liked to talk about.</font>

20:43.440 --> 20:46.120
<font color="#ffff00">I mean, Jean Ward was just her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">working name.</font>

20:47.200 --> 20:50.080
<font color="#ffff00">She was the Right Honourable</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Moira Creighton-Ward.</font>

20:53.440 --> 20:55.840
<font color="#ffff00">The daughter of Lord Bayswater</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and his first wife.</font>

20:55.880 --> 20:58.440
<font color="#ffff00">Charity Mudford is her stepmother.</font>

21:10.480 --> 21:12.080
(Military-style drumming)

21:16.920 --> 21:21.000
Drummer Hawkins, the boy that saved
the colours at Mboto Gorge.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.920
That's his actual drum.

21:22.960 --> 21:25.640
Victoria Cross, posthumous.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.680
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, his parents' pride, I'm sure.</font>

21:28.720 --> 21:31.920
Well, the regiment's, certainly.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.680
You're with the police?
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

21:33.720 --> 21:35.760
<font color="#ffff00">Detective Sergeant Morse, Thames</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Valley.</font>

21:35.800 --> 21:38.240
Doctor Laidlaw, on secondment from
Lonsdale.

21:38.280 --> 21:42.320
I lecture on military history.
I'm also writing a history of the
regiment.

21:42.360 --> 21:43.960
<font color="#ffff00">Right.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Is there any news...?</font>

21:44.000 --> 21:47.800
<font color="#ffff00">I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">say, but I'm sure you'll hear about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it soon enough.</font>

21:48.760 --> 21:50.360
(Bugle plays)

21:56.280 --> 21:58.200
<font color="#ffff00">Her stepmother's Lady Bayswater.</font>

21:59.480 --> 22:01.560
Charity Mudford?
<font color="#ffff00">Mm.</font>

22:02.880 --> 22:06.920
<font color="#ffff00">I saw her at the debating society</font>
<font color="#ffff00">yesterday. </font><font color="#ffffff">What do you make to her?</font>

22:08.960 --> 22:11.200
<font color="#ffff00">Well, she's got guts, I'll give her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">that.</font>

22:11.240 --> 22:14.160
<font color="#ffff00">When you know everyone in the room</font>
<font color="#ffff00">would have liked you hanged,</font>

22:14.200 --> 22:16.880
<font color="#ffff00">it takes a certain amount of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sangfroid to smile back.</font>

22:16.920 --> 22:20.560
Or just a brass neck. It's a wonder
she can show her face at all.

22:20.600 --> 22:23.600
<font color="#ffff00">Well, she seems pretty unrepentant.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Defiant, even.</font>

22:23.640 --> 22:26.720
<font color="#ffff00">Did Hitler really dance at their</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wedding, do you think?</font>

22:26.760 --> 22:28.760
Unlikely.

22:28.800 --> 22:33.000
They did stop off at Berchtesgaden
for a few days on the way back from
their honeymoon.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.840
<font color="#ffff00">Why did she come back to England?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Who knows?</font>

22:35.880 --> 22:37.880
Maybe we all come home in the end.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.000
Did you see Sam?

22:45.880 --> 22:47.880
<font color="#ffff00">He's going to be fine.</font>

22:48.920 --> 22:50.640
<font color="#ffff00">He's in the clear.</font>

22:50.680 --> 22:54.640
Comes to the army, nobody's ever in
the clear, only the dead.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.800
<font color="#ffff00">He's got you now, Johnny.</font>

23:04.840 --> 23:06.960
Says you, Mungo. Says you.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.160
But yon's a canny bugger, he always
has been.

23:09.200 --> 23:12.160
<font color="#ffff00">See, Mungo, I do have a natural</font>
<font color="#ffff00">advantage.</font>

23:12.200 --> 23:15.360
What might that be, Colonel?
<font color="#ffff00">Billiards is a game for gentlemen.</font>

23:15.400 --> 23:17.080
(Laughs)

23:17.120 --> 23:20.600
Ooh, that's fighting talk, make no
mistake.

23:23.240 --> 23:25.240
(Chuckles)

23:25.280 --> 23:27.280
What did I tell you?

23:27.320 --> 23:29.800
Never trust a bloody Englishman.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.120
<font color="#ffff00">Not too late tonight, Mungo, eh?</font>

23:35.160 --> 23:37.200
<font color="#ffff00">Heavy day tomorrow.</font>

23:37.240 --> 23:39.280
<font color="#ffff00">What with this girl on top of all.</font>

23:39.320 --> 23:41.480
Right you are, Johnny.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.760
<font color="#ffff00">Night, Mac.</font>

23:45.800 --> 23:48.000
Johnny.
(Door opens)

23:48.040 --> 23:50.320
You'll take a dram for the road?
(Door closes)

23:50.360 --> 23:54.800
<font color="#ffff00">I'm done, Mac. </font><font color="#ffffff">Oh, you're poor</font>
<font color="#ffffff">company, Mungo. Very poor.</font>

23:54.840 --> 23:56.760
You never used to be such a dull
companion.

23:59.480 --> 24:01.120
Well, go, if you're going.

24:03.320 --> 24:06.320
Prisoner and escort? Is that it?

24:06.360 --> 24:07.880
Go to your bed, man.

24:08.920 --> 24:11.160
You've not the tits for a wet nurse.

24:11.200 --> 24:13.640
I'm for a turn around the square.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.680
(Door opens)

24:15.720 --> 24:17.720
Get some air.

24:17.760 --> 24:19.960
(Door closes)

24:21.680 --> 24:23.680
(Key turns in lock)

24:25.440 --> 24:27.040
<font color="#ffff00">Did you see him?</font>

24:29.560 --> 24:30.880
No.

24:31.920 --> 24:33.920
No, it has to be played by the book.

24:33.960 --> 24:35.960
<font color="#ffff00">How do you mean?</font>

24:36.000 --> 24:40.200
Mr Bright wants me to take a back
seat, seeing as it's family,

24:40.240 --> 24:43.160
but Morse saw him, said he's doing
all right.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.840
<font color="#ffff00">I should let Joan know.</font>

24:45.880 --> 24:48.400
There's no point worrying her without
cause.

24:48.440 --> 24:50.240
(Keys clattering)

24:50.280 --> 24:52.520
It won't be anything to do with Sam.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
(Bell tolls)

25:17.040 --> 25:21.480
Single stab wound from behind,
through the intercostal region

25:21.520 --> 25:23.520
between the fourth and fifth rib.

25:23.560 --> 25:26.080
Pierced the posterior heart.

25:26.120 --> 25:30.120
Penetrated to a depth
of six-and-a-quarter inches,

25:30.160 --> 25:34.360
but there's no impression of a guard
on the skin about the wound,

25:34.400 --> 25:36.760
so it's unlikely it was driven all
the way in.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.400
<font color="#ffff00">A bayonet?</font>

25:38.440 --> 25:40.360
That's certainly possible.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.240
<font color="#ffff00">But there's nothing else,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">no funny business or...?</font>

25:43.280 --> 25:46.040
There doesn't appear to be
a sexual element, no,

25:46.080 --> 25:50.560
but these bottles of Dexedrine and
Seconal were in her handbag.

25:50.600 --> 25:53.720
Non-lethal quantities of both in her
bloodstream.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.760
De rigueur in the modelling business,
I believe.

25:56.800 --> 25:59.360
Amphetamines for weight loss.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.200
<font color="#ffff00">And the barbiturates?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Take the edge off the day.</font>

26:02.240 --> 26:05.320
Cumulative effect is to leave one
numb.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.760
<font color="#ffff00">To what?</font>

26:06.800 --> 26:08.400
Life.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.520
(Indistinct shouted orders)

26:19.440 --> 26:22.160
Where's your other beret, Private
Oswald? <font color="#ffff00">I dunno, sir.</font>

26:22.200 --> 26:25.880
When did you see it last? <font color="#ffff00">I can't</font>
<font color="#ffff00">remember, sir. Up at High Wood,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I think.</font>

26:25.920 --> 26:30.200
We're searching the area this
morning.
If it's up there, we'll find it.

26:40.880 --> 26:42.680
Lost your cap badge, Corporal?

26:43.320 --> 26:45.120
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, sir. A couple of days ago.</font>

26:45.160 --> 26:49.440
<font color="#ffff00">I was gonna put it in a chitty to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the QM but, with the deployment,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it slipped my mind.</font>

27:12.880 --> 27:14.880
(Birdsong)

27:18.200 --> 27:20.400
LADY BAYSWATER:
To what do I owe the pleasure?

27:23.040 --> 27:25.440
<font color="#ffff00">I'm afraid I have some very bad</font>
<font color="#ffff00">news.</font>

27:25.480 --> 27:29.280
<font color="#ffff00">It concerns your stepdaughter</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Moira Creighton-Ward.</font>

27:30.160 --> 27:32.240
Ah. I see.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.320
Drugs, is it?

27:35.360 --> 27:37.440
She does have a problem.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.280
<font color="#ffff00">No, madam.</font>

27:39.320 --> 27:41.120
Suicide, then?

27:41.160 --> 27:44.680
<font color="#ffff00">Why would you think that?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Well, she'd attempted it before.</font>

27:44.720 --> 27:47.160
It's how her mother went.
<font color="#ffff00">No, madam.</font>

27:47.200 --> 27:49.280
<font color="#ffff00">She was murdered.</font>

27:49.320 --> 27:51.400
How?

27:51.440 --> 27:53.520
<font color="#ffff00">She was stabbed.</font>

27:53.560 --> 27:55.560
(Sighs)

27:55.600 --> 27:58.360
<font color="#ffff00">When did you last see her?</font>

27:58.400 --> 28:00.720
Oh, er...not for some years.

28:00.760 --> 28:03.920
Things had never been very good
between us.

28:03.960 --> 28:08.120
She kept up a pretence of civility
for her father's sake

28:08.160 --> 28:11.240
but, after Paddy died,
I didn't really hear from her.

28:11.280 --> 28:13.280
<font color="#ffff00">What was she like?</font>

28:13.320 --> 28:14.600
Oh...

28:14.640 --> 28:17.440
Quite mad, like her mother.

28:17.480 --> 28:21.560
She ran up huge debts,
Bixby's club, Berkeley Square,

28:21.600 --> 28:25.320
expected her father to cover them,
which he did.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.920
<font color="#ffff00">And what about men?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Did she have a boyfriend?</font>

28:27.960 --> 28:31.720
Oh, yes. (Chuckles) Yes, she'd been
engaged,

28:31.760 --> 28:35.800
in the manner of the public
convenience at Victoria Station.

28:35.840 --> 28:38.440
Often and for short periods.

28:38.480 --> 28:40.480
It was all attention-seeking.

28:40.520 --> 28:44.640
She'd pick up with some wholly
unsuitable prospect for a couple of
months

28:44.680 --> 28:46.600
and then drop him.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.840
<font color="#ffff00">Unsuitable in what way?</font>

28:48.880 --> 28:50.880
Non-U types -

28:50.920 --> 28:53.520
Jews, blacks, Americans.

28:53.560 --> 28:55.560
Anything to annoy her father.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.520
<font color="#ffff00">And you, presumably?</font>

28:57.560 --> 29:00.560
I could hardly care less what she
did.

29:02.360 --> 29:06.760
But I knew, if she carried on in this
way,

29:06.800 --> 29:08.480
she'd come to a bad end.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.640
<font color="#ffff00">Right. General search, moving line</font>
<font color="#ffff00">abreast through the woods.</font>

29:13.680 --> 29:17.320
<font color="#ffff00">You're to be on the lookout in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">particular for an army beret like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this,</font>

29:17.360 --> 29:19.520
<font color="#ffff00">either with or without a cap badge.</font>

29:20.320 --> 29:22.320
<font color="#ffff00">Right? About your business.</font>

29:22.360 --> 29:23.760
Yes, sir.

29:24.760 --> 29:26.560
<font color="#ffff00">Keep an eye.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Of course.</font>

29:26.600 --> 29:28.600
Thanks.

29:32.160 --> 29:36.400
(Chanting) Integration for the
nation!
Integration for the nation!

29:36.440 --> 29:38.600
Integration for the nation!

29:38.640 --> 29:42.560
Integration for the nation!
Integration for the nation!

29:42.600 --> 29:44.920
Integration for the nation!

29:44.960 --> 29:49.040
Integration for the nation!
Integration for the nation!

29:49.080 --> 29:50.680
Integration...

29:52.360 --> 29:54.560
<font color="#ffff00">MAN: All clear!</font>

29:55.400 --> 29:56.920
<font color="#ffff00">Keep looking!</font>

29:59.200 --> 30:01.880
Morning.
<font color="#ffff00">Matey, how'd the postmortem go?</font>

30:01.920 --> 30:04.640
Single stab wound. Bayonet, possibly.

30:04.680 --> 30:07.320
There's a quantity of uppers and
downers in her system,

30:07.360 --> 30:11.320
par for the course in the circles in
which she moved according to Dr
DeBryn. You?

30:11.360 --> 30:15.280
<font color="#ffff00">There's a Private Oswald says</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he lost his beret up here yesterday.</font>

30:15.320 --> 30:19.160
Right. So, if we find it
and it doesn't have a cap badge...

30:19.200 --> 30:21.680
<font color="#ffff00">Sam Thursday's lost a cap badge too.</font>

30:21.720 --> 30:23.600
SERGEANT MAJOR DAVIES:
Oi! Oi!

30:23.640 --> 30:28.080
You in the bloody field! Yes, you!
Stand still! Don't move!

30:28.120 --> 30:30.320
<font color="#ffff00">What is it? What's wrong?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">He's in a minefield.</font>

30:30.360 --> 30:33.680
<font color="#ffff00">He's what?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Fancy, stay still!</font>

30:33.720 --> 30:34.760
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

30:34.800 --> 30:37.400
Stay completely still!
A soldier will come and fetch you!

30:42.200 --> 30:46.720
Integration for the nation!
Integration for the nation!

30:47.520 --> 30:51.120
<font color="#ffff00">You can't call me a racialist,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">not by any stretch of the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">imagination.</font>

30:51.160 --> 30:55.560
<font color="#ffff00">I went to see Sammy Davis Jr in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Golden Boy at The Palladium only</font>
<font color="#ffff00">three months back,</font>

30:55.600 --> 30:57.760
<font color="#ffff00">so I think that speaks volumes.</font>

30:57.800 --> 30:59.520
Then why not take the sign down?

30:59.560 --> 31:03.080
<font color="#ffff00">If it were up to me, I would.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">It's your salon, Mrs Radowicz.</font>

31:03.120 --> 31:06.800
<font color="#ffff00">It's not as if I have anything</font>
<font color="#ffff00">against them personally. I don't.</font>

31:06.840 --> 31:09.640
<font color="#ffff00">I've always gone out of my way</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to treat them like equals.</font>

31:10.680 --> 31:13.280
<font color="#ffff00">It's my customers, they won't have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it.</font>

31:14.480 --> 31:16.080
What is it they don't like?

31:16.120 --> 31:17.600
<font color="#ffff00">Towels, for one.</font>

31:17.640 --> 31:19.320
Towels?

31:19.360 --> 31:22.320
<font color="#ffff00">They don't like using the same</font>
<font color="#ffff00">towels.</font>

31:22.360 --> 31:26.080
<font color="#ffff00">I've told them all the towels</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are sent away for a boil wash,</font>

31:26.120 --> 31:28.120
<font color="#ffff00">but it cuts very little ice.</font>

31:28.160 --> 31:30.160
<font color="#ffff00">Then there's the combs.</font>

31:30.200 --> 31:32.680
<font color="#ffff00">I can't send them away for a boil</font>
<font color="#ffff00">wash.</font>

31:32.720 --> 31:38.640
<font color="#ffff00">Someone said I should buy</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a steriliser, but this is a hair</font>
<font color="#ffff00">salon, not an operating theatre.</font>

31:38.680 --> 31:42.120
Well, at least your customers
wouldn't have to worry about curlers.

31:42.160 --> 31:44.520
<font color="#ffff00">No. Every cloud...</font>

31:48.560 --> 31:50.800
(Detector crackles)

31:50.840 --> 31:53.920
It's all right, you're perfectly
safe. Nothing to worry about.

31:53.960 --> 31:56.800
<font color="#ffff00">Whatever you say.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Just follow on behind Private Jones.</font>

31:56.840 --> 31:59.560
Watch where he puts his feet,
see you do the same.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.800
Gentlemen...
<font color="#ffff00">All right. All right. Thank you.</font>

32:03.440 --> 32:06.080
<font color="#ffff00">What do you think you're doing,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">going out into the field?</font>

32:06.120 --> 32:07.960
Time and a place. Give the lad
a break.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.120
<font color="#ffff00">I thought I saw something.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">What do you mean?</font>

32:10.160 --> 32:13.000
<font color="#ffff00">Out in the field. (Panting)</font>

32:15.040 --> 32:16.680
<font color="#ffff00">That's what I went in there for.</font>

32:17.720 --> 32:19.320
<font color="#ffff00">There's a name inside.</font>

32:19.360 --> 32:21.640
MORSE: It's blood.

32:32.960 --> 32:35.440
So tell us when you last remember
having your beret.

32:35.480 --> 32:39.120
<font color="#ffff00">Can't say, sir. Yesterday afternoon,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I reckon.</font>

32:39.160 --> 32:42.920
Right. You were late for the
transport back to the front gate.

32:42.960 --> 32:48.520
<font color="#ffff00">I er...got taken short and went into</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the woods to relieve myself.</font>

32:48.560 --> 32:52.200
And did you have your beret then?
<font color="#ffff00">I dunno, sir, it was hot.</font>

32:52.240 --> 32:56.080
<font color="#ffff00">We'd been moving stuff for the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">photographer. Rails of clothes.</font>

32:56.120 --> 32:58.520
<font color="#ffff00">I must have stuck it in my pocket</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for a second.</font>

32:58.560 --> 33:02.120
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe it came out of my pocket</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the way back to the vehicle.</font>

33:02.160 --> 33:05.320
<font color="#ffff00">With everything that went on,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't miss it till later.</font>

33:05.360 --> 33:08.520
You didn't see Miss Ward in the
woods? <font color="#ffff00">No, sir.</font>

33:08.560 --> 33:10.440
What about anybody else?
<font color="#ffff00">No, sir.</font>

33:10.480 --> 33:13.000
<font color="#ffff00">There was nobody out there that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I saw.</font>

33:13.040 --> 33:16.320
You were part of the search party
that went to look for her.

33:16.360 --> 33:19.520
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, sir. Me and Corporal</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Thursday... </font><font color="#ffffff">Mm-hm.</font>

33:19.560 --> 33:23.760
<font color="#ffff00">..Geordie, Sergeant Major Davies</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and Mr Carmichael.</font>

33:23.800 --> 33:25.760
You didn't see her then?
<font color="#ffff00">No, sir.</font>

33:25.800 --> 33:28.600
<font color="#ffff00">It was Corporal Thursday that found</font>
<font color="#ffff00">her. </font><font color="#ffffff">Eventually.</font>

33:29.640 --> 33:32.120
Maybe she had got lost, as everyone
thought.

33:33.280 --> 33:35.920
Maybe you found her first.
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't.</font>

33:35.960 --> 33:38.440
Are you sure you didn't try it on
with her? <font color="#ffff00">No...sir.</font>

33:38.480 --> 33:41.200
She wasn't interested maybe, is that
it? Did she scream?

33:41.240 --> 33:45.240
Call out? Everyone out looking for
her, it wouldn't take long before
they found you.

33:45.280 --> 33:47.280
You had to shut her up.
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

33:47.320 --> 33:49.240
<font color="#ffff00">It wasn't like that.</font>

33:49.280 --> 33:53.000
Did she give you the glad eye? Lead
you up the garden path, then change
her mind?

33:53.040 --> 33:55.080
That how it was?
<font color="#ffff00">No.</font>

33:57.840 --> 34:01.400
<font color="#ffff00">It was just a kiss.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">"Just a kiss."</font>

34:01.440 --> 34:06.280
<font color="#ffff00">Where was this? </font><font color="#ffffff">In the woods,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">when I went for a jimmy.</font>

34:07.320 --> 34:10.440
She said she was trying to find
Murder Town and had lost her way.

34:10.480 --> 34:14.440
We had a couple of words and I said
I'd see her back once I'd done my
business.

34:14.480 --> 34:18.080
She gave me a peck
and then something spooked her.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.239
<font color="#ffff00">What was it? What spooked her?</font>

34:20.280 --> 34:23.120
I dunno. There was a noise - a twig
cracking.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.520
<font color="#ffff00">But you couldn't see anybody else</font>
<font color="#ffff00">there? </font><font color="#ffffff">No.</font>

34:26.560 --> 34:28.560
But she was keen to make the bus.

34:28.600 --> 34:33.400
I pointed her in the right direction,
she set off,
I had a pee and I made my way back.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.639
I swear, I never touched her.

34:42.920 --> 34:46.040
<font color="#ffff00">Ossie!</font>
<font color="#ffffff">As you were, Corporal.</font>

34:46.080 --> 34:50.560
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't do it, Corp. You've gotta</font>
<font color="#ffff00">tell 'em! Corp, I didn't do it!</font>

35:03.640 --> 35:05.800
It's a bad business, Johnny.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.320
It's bad for morale on the eve of
deployment.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.960
<font color="#ffff00">Well, maybe that's a blessing, Jack</font>
<font color="#ffff00">- Germany.</font>

35:11.000 --> 35:13.640
<font color="#ffff00">Men'll have more important things</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to worry about.</font>

35:13.680 --> 35:15.880
More important than the honour
of the regiment?

35:15.920 --> 35:19.080
<font color="#ffff00">This time tomorrow, there won't be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a regiment. Mungo's right.</font>

35:19.120 --> 35:23.440
<font color="#ffff00">We'll be out of here and on our way.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">A good soldier never looks back,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Jack, you know that.</font>

35:24.280 --> 35:27.800
And that poor, wee laddie with the
police, Private Oswald...

35:29.480 --> 35:31.680
No man left behind, Johnny.

35:36.280 --> 35:39.040
<font color="#ffff00">BRIGHT:</font>
<font color="#ffff00">So it's his beret, no question,</font>

35:39.080 --> 35:42.320
<font color="#ffff00">without a cap badge and bloodied,</font>

35:42.360 --> 35:44.800
<font color="#ffff00">as if it had been used to wipe</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the blade clean.</font>

35:44.840 --> 35:46.440
THURSDAY: No sign of the weapon as
yet.

35:46.480 --> 35:49.280
<font color="#ffff00">He'd have to be an idiot to tie</font>
<font color="#ffff00">himself to the crime like that.</font>

35:49.320 --> 35:51.880
Or he panicked.
<font color="#ffff00">But say he's telling the truth.</font>

35:51.920 --> 35:56.160
<font color="#ffff00">Say he lost his beret in the woods</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and somebody else picked it up.</font>

35:56.200 --> 36:00.000
All rather fortuitous, wouldn't you
say? <font color="#ffff00">Perhaps, but it's not</font>
<font color="#ffff00">impossible, sir.</font>

36:00.040 --> 36:03.760
Look, I know it's no mystery, but
sometimes the simplest answer is the
right one.

36:03.800 --> 36:08.120
What have you got against it being
him? <font color="#ffff00">Nothing, I'm just trying to keep</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an open mind.</font>

36:08.160 --> 36:10.720
<font color="#ffff00">It is the job, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">You don't think Oswald did it?</font>

36:10.760 --> 36:13.760
<font color="#ffff00">Something spooked her. </font><font color="#ffffff">If you're</font>
<font color="#ffffff">taking Oswald's word for it.</font>

36:13.800 --> 36:15.240
Course he's gonna say that.

36:15.280 --> 36:17.360
<font color="#ffff00">But what if somebody else WAS there?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Who?</font>

36:17.400 --> 36:21.800
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know, but someone that she</font>
<font color="#ffff00">knew, or knew her, or recognised</font>
<font color="#ffff00">her, at least?</font>

36:21.840 --> 36:23.680
From where?
<font color="#ffff00">Pin-up, wasn't she?</font>

36:23.720 --> 36:26.400
(Phone rings)
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe someone saw her in the papers.</font>

36:26.440 --> 36:27.880
She'd have been hard to miss.

36:27.920 --> 36:31.120
She was well-known in society
circles,
always in the gossip columns.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.120
If anyone on that base knew her, it's
more likely to have been someone of
her own class.

36:35.160 --> 36:36.640
<font color="#ffff00">An officer, then?</font>

36:36.680 --> 36:39.560
That was the base.
There's been a development.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.440
<font color="#ffff00">This was found where?</font>

37:00.480 --> 37:05.080
Stuffed down a drain in the wash
house, shortly after 1400 by
a cleaning party.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.520
<font color="#ffff00">Which consisted of whom?</font>

37:07.560 --> 37:10.480
Lance Corporal Thursday
and Private Collier.

37:10.520 --> 37:14.800
<font color="#ffff00">Erm...right, and who has access</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to the wash house generally?</font>

37:14.840 --> 37:19.320
Well, it's designated for the use of
other ranks, but anyone on the base
could stop off there.

37:19.360 --> 37:22.560
<font color="#ffff00">And could anyone have been there</font>
<font color="#ffff00">during this photographic shoot?</font>

37:22.600 --> 37:26.480
Unlikely. Most of the base are down
here at HQ preparing for deployment.

37:26.520 --> 37:29.280
<font color="#ffff00">Where is it, in relation to Murder</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Town?</font>

37:29.320 --> 37:33.160
A 10, 15-minute walk, seven-minute
run.

37:33.200 --> 37:36.280
You have to pass it on the way back
from High Wood to barracks.

37:36.320 --> 37:41.240
<font color="#ffff00">Right. Well, we'll take a run out</font>
<font color="#ffff00">there later, but first, I'd like to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">speak to this cleaning party.</font>

37:44.640 --> 37:48.640
(Chanting) Integration for the
nation! Integration for the nation!

37:48.680 --> 37:52.800
Integration for the nation!
Integration for the nation!

37:52.840 --> 37:54.760
Integration for the nation!

37:54.800 --> 37:58.600
Integration for the nation!
Integration for the nation!

37:58.640 --> 38:00.680
Integration for the nation!

38:01.720 --> 38:03.720
<font color="#ffff00">Stand up.</font>

38:07.080 --> 38:08.720
As you were.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.920
Private Collier, I understand
it was you who found the bayonet.

38:11.960 --> 38:15.560
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, Colonel. The water wouldn't</font>
<font color="#ffff00">drain away, so Sam and me...</font>

38:15.600 --> 38:19.040
<font color="#ffff00">Lance Corporal Thursday, Colonel,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">we got the grate up.</font>

38:19.080 --> 38:22.000
<font color="#ffff00">I had a rummage, like, and there it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was. </font><font color="#ffffff">Any questions?</font>

38:22.040 --> 38:25.720
<font color="#ffff00">Did either of you come by the wash</font>
<font color="#ffff00">house the afternoon Miss Ward went</font>
<font color="#ffff00">missing?</font>

38:25.760 --> 38:30.440
Private Oswald did, sir, aye.
Only to see if the girl had gone
there, mind.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.840
Me and Ossie split up. Thursday
was fetching Lieutenant Carmichael.

38:33.880 --> 38:37.800
<font color="#ffff00">I stopped by the wash house too,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on my way to raise the alarm, just</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in case.</font>

38:37.840 --> 38:39.800
Did you see anybody?

38:39.840 --> 38:44.360
<font color="#ffff00">No. I gave the place a quick shufti</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and then made my way back to base.</font>

38:49.360 --> 38:53.840
Any of them could have put it there.
<font color="#ffff00">Including Private Oswald.</font>

38:53.880 --> 38:56.080
<font color="#ffff00">He's admitted snogging her in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">woods.</font>

38:56.120 --> 38:58.800
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe that's as much as</font>
<font color="#ffff00">he can admit to himself.</font>

38:58.840 --> 39:01.440
<font color="#ffff00">It's Oswald's beret we found covered</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in blood.</font>

39:01.480 --> 39:04.960
If it turns out this bayonet's got
his dabs on it... <font color="#ffff00">If.</font>

39:06.040 --> 39:09.960
Short of a signed confession, what
more do you want? Can't win 'em all,
matey.

39:10.880 --> 39:16.040
Look, there's only two people missing
cap badges and one of them's Sam
Thursday.

39:16.080 --> 39:19.800
There's no way it was him.
<font color="#ffff00">You didn't think he was a bit cagey?</font>

39:22.320 --> 39:25.880
Integration for the nation!
Integration for the nation!

39:25.920 --> 39:27.680
Integration for the nation!

39:27.720 --> 39:29.920
(Chanting stops)
<font color="#ffff00">Quiet!</font>

39:29.960 --> 39:35.240
The sign on this door says,
"No coloureds".

39:36.280 --> 39:39.680
This is the language of segregation.
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

39:39.720 --> 39:41.240
Of Apartheid.

39:41.280 --> 39:44.480
It is bigotry. Now the world knows
what happens

39:44.520 --> 39:49.160
when one group of human beings decide
another group is something less.

39:49.200 --> 39:53.880
But make no mistake, my brothers and
sisters,

39:53.920 --> 39:57.440
the road that starts with
exclusion...

39:58.680 --> 40:01.800
..ends at the crematoria.

40:01.840 --> 40:03.840
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">That's right.</font>

40:13.640 --> 40:16.840
<font color="#ffff00">I've asked if anybody from the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">barracks</font>
<font color="#ffff00">has been out to the wash house.</font>

40:16.880 --> 40:19.160
<font color="#ffff00">They're not putting their hands up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to it.</font>

40:19.200 --> 40:22.360
Right. <font color="#ffff00">Strange is just finishing up</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with the CO.</font>

40:22.400 --> 40:23.840
<font color="#ffff00">What's all that?</font>

40:23.880 --> 40:27.440
It's everything I could find on
Moira Creighton-Ward from the press
archive.

40:27.480 --> 40:31.240
<font color="#ffff00">Seems a lot of palaver to go</font>
<font color="#ffff00">through, to get rid of it.</font>

40:31.280 --> 40:36.360
<font color="#ffff00">If it is the murder weapon, then</font>
<font color="#ffff00">why not just bury it in the woods?</font>

40:36.400 --> 40:40.520
<font color="#ffff00">It'd be the devil's own job to find</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it out there, even with a mine</font>
<font color="#ffff00">detector.</font>

40:40.560 --> 40:43.800
<font color="#ffff00">The place must be alive</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with shrapnel and spent rounds.</font>

40:43.840 --> 40:45.240
Hm?

40:45.280 --> 40:50.440
<font color="#ffff00">I said it seems a daft place to hide</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a murder weapon, the wash house.</font>

40:50.480 --> 40:53.520
Unless whoever put it there
wanted it to be found.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.680
That's interesting.
<font color="#ffff00">What?</font>

40:57.720 --> 41:01.880
Lady Bayswater said her stepdaughter
was engaged often and for short
periods.

41:01.920 --> 41:03.520
Look, announcements...

41:08.520 --> 41:11.200
(Knocks on door)
Hello?

41:12.920 --> 41:16.360
<font color="#ffff00">Detective Sergeant Morse, isn't it?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">That's right.</font>

41:16.400 --> 41:19.800
Dr Laidlaw, this is Detective
Sergeant Strange. <font color="#ffff00">Good afternoon.</font>

41:19.840 --> 41:22.360
Toy soldiers, Doctor?
<font color="#ffff00">War gaming.</font>

41:22.400 --> 41:25.600
<font color="#ffff00">It's instructive for officers</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to replay famous battles.</font>

41:25.640 --> 41:28.120
I'm sure. What's today?

41:28.880 --> 41:31.040
<font color="#ffff00">Battle of Cannae, Second Punic War.</font>

41:31.080 --> 41:33.080
<font color="#ffff00">Are you familiar?</font>

41:33.120 --> 41:35.120
HE will be, I expect.

41:36.000 --> 41:38.480
<font color="#ffff00">Just a treat. The regiment moving</font>
<font color="#ffff00">out.</font>

41:38.520 --> 41:41.800
<font color="#ffff00">All feels rather...end of term.</font>

41:41.840 --> 41:45.520
We wanted to talk to you
about the girl that was killed here.

41:45.560 --> 41:48.640
<font color="#ffff00">Oh. I understood you arrested</font>
<font color="#ffff00">one of the privates for it.</font>

41:48.680 --> 41:51.200
He's helping us with our inquiries.

41:52.080 --> 41:54.480
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not sure what I can tell you,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't see her.</font>

41:55.480 --> 41:59.120
<font color="#ffff00">It was Jean something, wasn't it?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">No, no, her name was Moira</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Creighton-Ward.</font>

41:59.160 --> 42:01.440
I believe you were engaged to be
married.

42:04.200 --> 42:05.800
<font color="#ffff00">Ten years ago.</font>

42:05.840 --> 42:08.560
Ah.
<font color="#ffff00">Wait a minute, you're...</font>

42:08.600 --> 42:12.160
<font color="#ffff00">You're saying the girl up at High</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Wood, that was... that was Moira?</font>

42:13.120 --> 42:14.720
<font color="#ffff00">Good God!</font>

42:18.560 --> 42:20.720
When did you see her last?

42:22.280 --> 42:24.280
<font color="#ffff00">Not since she quit her degree.</font>

42:24.320 --> 42:29.600
You never wondered what happened to
her? <font color="#ffff00">It was one mad term. We were</font>
<font color="#ffff00">very young.</font>

42:29.640 --> 42:33.360
<font color="#ffff00">In any case, it would never have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">worked out. </font><font color="#ffffff">Why? Why not?</font>

42:33.400 --> 42:39.000
<font color="#ffff00">I suppose because I was always</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a rather dull academic and Moira</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was...wild.</font>

42:39.040 --> 42:43.040
Where were you between four and six
yesterday afternoon?

42:44.080 --> 42:47.520
<font color="#ffff00">I was here, trying to complete</font>
<font color="#ffff00">my regimental history,</font>

42:47.560 --> 42:51.400
<font color="#ffff00">in order to present it to the CO at</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the flag-lowering ceremony tomorrow.</font>

42:51.440 --> 42:53.800
Anyone vouch for your whereabouts?

42:55.520 --> 42:59.400
<font color="#ffff00">I saw Colonel McDuff in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">officers' mess at around five</font>
<font color="#ffff00">o'clock.</font>

42:59.440 --> 43:05.040
<font color="#ffff00">Look, really, I am very happily</font>
<font color="#ffff00">married with two children of my own.</font>

43:05.080 --> 43:08.560
<font color="#ffff00">So, you see, if I'd married Moira,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I would never have met my wife.</font>

43:09.600 --> 43:11.200
<font color="#ffff00">You can't hold on to people.</font>

43:21.080 --> 43:23.320
All done?
<font color="#ffff00">For now.</font>

43:23.360 --> 43:26.640
<font color="#ffff00">Wanna get this bayonet back</font>
<font color="#ffff00">so Forensics can take a look at it.</font>

43:26.680 --> 43:29.880
<font color="#ffff00">Having a word with Private Oswald,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">see what he's got to say about it.</font>

43:29.920 --> 43:34.120
I'll take one last look around here,
see if Colonel McDuff can confirm
Laidlaw's alibi.

43:34.160 --> 43:35.920
I'll see you back at the station.

43:39.080 --> 43:40.680
<font color="#ffff00">Morse?</font>

43:40.720 --> 43:42.720
<font color="#ffff00">I thought you had your man?</font>

43:42.760 --> 43:44.480
No, he's not been charged yet.

43:44.520 --> 43:47.240
<font color="#ffff00">So, what's this, you're still</font>
<font color="#ffff00">looking for proof?</font>

43:47.280 --> 43:49.080
Something like that. You?

43:50.920 --> 43:52.920
What was it you didn't tell me, Sam?

43:53.960 --> 43:56.760
She kissed me when I walked her
back to Murder Town.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.880
Just a kiss, or...something else?

44:03.920 --> 44:05.800
<font color="#ffff00">Just a kiss, but it was my fault.</font>

44:05.840 --> 44:09.480
<font color="#ffff00">I should have been watching her,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and now Ossie's in the frame.</font>

44:09.520 --> 44:11.520
<font color="#ffff00">He didn't do it, Morse.</font>

44:11.560 --> 44:13.560
All right.

44:13.600 --> 44:17.120
Whatever happened, I'll get to the
bottom of it. I promise you.

44:24.760 --> 44:28.400
(Chanting) Integration for the
nation! Integration for the nation!

44:28.440 --> 44:31.400
Integration for the nation!
<font color="#ffff00">That's her!</font>

44:31.440 --> 44:33.640
<font color="#ffff00">Stop her!</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Integration for the nation!</font>

44:33.680 --> 44:37.440
Integration for the nation!
<font color="#ffff00">Stop her! Stop her!</font>

44:37.480 --> 44:40.840
Integration for the nation!

44:40.880 --> 44:43.560

44:46.680 --> 44:48.920

45:39.360 --> 45:40.840
(Van door closes)

46:27.160 --> 46:29.160
(Faint clatter)

47:18.120 --> 47:20.320
<font color="#ffff00">Yes?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">You'd better come, sir.</font>

47:24.360 --> 47:27.080
I found this bastard creeping behind
the lines.

47:27.120 --> 47:30.800
<font color="#ffff00">Easy, Jack, easy. There's a good</font>
<font color="#ffff00">chap. He's one of ours.</font>

47:30.840 --> 47:32.520
MCDUFF: One of ours?

<font color="#ffff00">(Morse grunts)</font>

47:34.240 --> 47:36.520
He disnae know the password.
<font color="#ffff00">Colonel McDuff!</font>

47:39.200 --> 47:42.520
<font color="#ffff00">You will release the prisoner</font>
<font color="#ffff00">into my charge unharmed.</font>

47:42.560 --> 47:44.280
<font color="#ffff00">That's an order!</font>

47:44.320 --> 47:45.800
(Panting)

<font color="#ffff00">Colonel.</font>

47:47.280 --> 47:49.160
Your dagger, Jack.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.800
Jack!

47:56.680 --> 47:59.280
Major Coward, escort Colonel McDuff
to his quarters.

47:59.320 --> 48:01.560
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, Colonel. Come on, Jack.</font>

48:01.600 --> 48:03.600
(Morse groans)

48:08.400 --> 48:10.000
(Exhales sharply)

48:10.040 --> 48:14.200
<font color="#ffff00">If you've ever wondered what a hero</font>
<font color="#ffff00">looks like, you've just met one.</font>

48:16.920 --> 48:20.120
Colonel McDuff is the bravest man
I ever saw.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.360
<font color="#ffff00">What's the matter with him?</font>

48:25.320 --> 48:27.720
Korea, Imjin River.

48:28.760 --> 48:31.840
4,000 of ours against 27,000 of
theirs.

48:31.880 --> 48:33.680
A night action.

48:33.720 --> 48:36.640
Close quarters, wave after wave.

48:36.680 --> 48:39.400
A third of the battalion were killed
or wounded,

48:39.440 --> 48:42.320
including Mad Jack McDuff,
who took a mortar round.

48:46.120 --> 48:49.680
When the order came to fall back,
he stayed behind

48:49.720 --> 48:51.720
to give the rest of us a chance.

48:51.760 --> 48:55.080
Had two years in a Chinese prison
camp.

48:55.120 --> 48:59.000
If he drinks too much and sleeps with
the light on, then, so be it.

48:59.040 --> 49:01.400
He's earned the right.
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, but all the same...</font>

49:01.440 --> 49:04.160
No, Sergeant Morse,
there's no "all the same" about it.

49:05.120 --> 49:07.120
The regiment takes care of its own.

49:12.360 --> 49:14.160

All right, Bennett, get yourself
a brew. I'll take it from here.

50:11.680 --> 50:14.400
Well, first things first.

50:14.440 --> 50:15.920
Are you all right?

50:17.520 --> 50:18.880
Are you sure?

50:22.760 --> 50:24.760
Division are looking for scalps.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.800
They wanna make an example.

50:26.840 --> 50:28.840
Everyone there's gonna be charged.

50:28.880 --> 50:32.120

50:34.200 --> 50:36.680
<font color="#ffff00">Well, aren't you gonna charge me?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I was there.</font>

50:36.720 --> 50:40.640
No, you weren't
and you haven't been here, neither.

50:40.680 --> 50:44.280
<font color="#ffff00">I've given my name and address.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">You let ME worry about that.</font>

50:48.640 --> 50:50.640
Come on.

50:50.680 --> 50:52.280
(Footsteps)

50:52.320 --> 50:54.320
(Door opens)

51:10.560 --> 51:12.560
<font color="#ffff00">All right?</font>

51:12.600 --> 51:14.600
<font color="#ffff00">I couldn't see you before.</font>

51:14.640 --> 51:17.760
<font color="#ffff00">I wanted to, but it had to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be by the book, being family.</font>

51:17.800 --> 51:20.400
<font color="#ffff00">Your mum's been worried half out of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">her mind.</font>

51:21.480 --> 51:23.760
They arrested Ossie Oswald.
<font color="#ffff00">I know.</font>

51:23.800 --> 51:25.680
He didn't do it, Dad.

51:25.720 --> 51:28.600
<font color="#ffff00">Well, it was him or you, Sam,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I know it wasn't you.</font>

51:28.640 --> 51:30.640
Ossie's a good bloke.

51:30.680 --> 51:33.400
<font color="#ffff00">You wanna know</font>
<font color="#ffff00">how many good blokes I've nicked?</font>

51:33.440 --> 51:35.440
<font color="#ffff00">Good or bad don't come into it.</font>

51:35.480 --> 51:39.400
<font color="#ffff00">We just follow the evidence.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">He's in my section. I know him.</font>

51:40.440 --> 51:44.760
If you won't do anything about it,
I will. <font color="#ffff00">No. You're gonna keep your</font>
<font color="#ffff00">head down,</font>

51:44.800 --> 51:48.120
<font color="#ffff00">and you're gonna ship over to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Germany and leave all this behind.</font>

51:48.160 --> 51:50.680
I'm not a kid anymore, Dad.
<font color="#ffff00">I know that.</font>

51:50.720 --> 51:53.840
You know, when I was at school,

51:53.880 --> 51:56.080
I used to get it in the playground.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.120
ACAB.

51:58.160 --> 52:00.160
"All coppers are bastards."

52:01.200 --> 52:04.480
"Not my Dad," I'd say,
"He's one of the good ones."

52:05.520 --> 52:07.120
Times I'd get a thumping.

52:08.040 --> 52:09.520
<font color="#ffff00">You never said.</font>

52:09.560 --> 52:11.960
No. You know why?

52:12.840 --> 52:15.560
Because I was frightened of
what you might do to them.

52:17.720 --> 52:19.960
Give Mum my love.
<font color="#ffff00">Sam...</font>

52:20.000 --> 52:22.000
One of the good ones.

52:22.040 --> 52:24.040
I really believed that.

52:24.080 --> 52:26.080
Are you one of the good ones?

52:41.920 --> 52:44.240
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks for the lift. There was no</font>
<font color="#ffff00">need.</font>

52:46.960 --> 52:49.320
Maybe we should go for a drink.

52:49.360 --> 52:51.520
You know, when you're feeling up for
it.

52:53.400 --> 52:55.040
<font color="#ffff00">You're persistent, aren't you?</font>

52:55.080 --> 52:58.040
Faint heart never won fair lady.

52:58.080 --> 53:00.200
<font color="#ffff00">You don't even know me.</font>

53:00.240 --> 53:02.160
I'd love to, though.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.440
<font color="#ffff00">All right.</font>

53:05.480 --> 53:07.960
What? Really?

53:08.000 --> 53:12.840
<font color="#ffff00">Cold feet? </font><font color="#ffffff">No. No, no, no, no.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Just...surprised is all.</font>

53:12.880 --> 53:15.720
<font color="#ffff00">I'd take advantage if I were you.</font>

53:15.760 --> 53:17.520
Oh.

53:17.560 --> 53:20.240
<font color="#ffff00">Ow!</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Oh, I am so sorry.</font>

53:20.280 --> 53:22.720
<font color="#ffff00">(Sighs)</font>
<font color="#ffffff">I'm s... I'm so sorry.</font>

53:24.560 --> 53:28.240
<font color="#ffff00">I'll see you at work.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Sure.</font>

53:36.160 --> 53:37.640
(Sighs)

53:41.200 --> 53:45.040
<font color="#ffff00">THURSDAY: Sam's out the firing line.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He's off the hook. You don't have to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">worry.</font>

53:46.800 --> 53:49.680
I knew it'd be right. He's a good
boy.

53:50.720 --> 53:52.720
<font color="#ffff00">Not a boy any more.</font>

53:52.760 --> 53:55.040
<font color="#ffff00">He's a man now, his own man.</font>

53:56.360 --> 53:58.080
<font color="#ffff00">He's got responsibilities.</font>

53:58.120 --> 53:59.800
<font color="#ffff00">You'd be proud of him.</font>

53:59.840 --> 54:01.840
Oh, I'm always proud of him.

54:01.880 --> 54:04.160
They grow up so quick.

54:04.200 --> 54:07.040
One day, the biggest decision in the
world is wafer or cornet.

54:07.080 --> 54:09.080
The next, it's life or death.

54:10.520 --> 54:14.040
<font color="#ffff00">Shame we can't all get together for</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a nice tea, you know, all four of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">us...</font>

54:15.080 --> 54:16.680
<font color="#ffff00">..before he goes off to Germany.</font>

54:16.720 --> 54:18.600
Plenty of time for that
when he gets back.

54:18.640 --> 54:20.600
<font color="#ffff00">Nine months?</font>

54:20.640 --> 54:23.840
You could always get the coach down
there, see him.

54:23.880 --> 54:26.240
<font color="#ffff00">All that way?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Why not?</font>

54:26.280 --> 54:28.080
Else fly.

54:28.840 --> 54:30.640
<font color="#ffff00">What would I want with flying?</font>

54:30.680 --> 54:33.360
<font color="#ffff00">And anyway, what do you mean,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">"You could"?</font>

54:33.400 --> 54:35.000
<font color="#ffff00">You mean WE could.</font>

54:35.040 --> 54:37.040
<font color="#ffff00">It's not as if you shan't have time.</font>

54:37.080 --> 54:39.080
Well, what about work?

54:40.120 --> 54:42.560
<font color="#ffff00">What about it? You'll be done with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it by then.</font>

54:47.560 --> 54:50.160
<font color="#ffff00">You're not changing your mind, are</font>
<font color="#ffff00">you?</font>

54:50.200 --> 54:52.200
No, no, of course not.

54:52.240 --> 54:55.720
<font color="#ffff00">Morse'll be all right, if that's</font>
<font color="#ffff00">what you're fretting about.</font>

54:55.760 --> 54:57.760
Yeah, I know he will.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.760
This last go round...he's doing well.

55:03.880 --> 55:06.520
<font color="#ffff00">Well, then. Remember what we said?</font>

55:07.560 --> 55:09.560
<font color="#ffff00">You only get one life.</font>

55:15.600 --> 55:17.920
MORSE: Love and rain.

55:19.520 --> 55:21.520
<font color="#ffff00">How English.</font>

55:23.160 --> 55:25.360
I don't think we can claim it all
for ourselves.

55:26.400 --> 55:29.000
People have been doing this
since there's been people.

55:29.040 --> 55:31.040
Before, even.

55:32.160 --> 55:34.960
Back when we were...whatever we were.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.480
(Thunderclap)

55:36.520 --> 55:38.520
<font color="#ffff00">Quelle philosophe!</font>

55:39.640 --> 55:41.920
They probably lay on branches...

55:43.200 --> 55:45.000
..wrapped in each other's arms,

55:45.040 --> 55:48.440
staring out at thunderheads
breaking over the savanna.

55:50.600 --> 55:53.600
Safe in that one, brief moment...

55:55.840 --> 55:58.400
..from the vast awfulness of it all.

55:58.440 --> 56:02.080
<font color="#ffff00">If he was as gloomy as you, I hope</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she kicked him out of the tree.</font>

56:02.120 --> 56:05.080
Gloomy?
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, my God. Some men...</font>

56:05.120 --> 56:06.920
Some men?
<font color="#ffff00">..are so gloomy. (Laughs)</font>

56:06.960 --> 56:09.160
<font color="#ffff00">Of course, that's the part you hear.</font>

56:09.200 --> 56:11.000
(Chuckles)

56:12.040 --> 56:14.320
<font color="#ffff00">Seriously, why do you do that,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">like someone died?</font>

56:14.360 --> 56:16.440
In my case, someone usually has.

56:16.480 --> 56:18.480
<font color="#ffff00">(Giggles)</font>
<font color="#ffffff">(Thunder rumbles)</font>

56:18.520 --> 56:20.520
I don't know.

56:20.560 --> 56:23.440
They say you're never so alive
as when you're close to death.

56:23.480 --> 56:26.960
Well, maybe the reverse is also true.
<font color="#ffff00">Jesus! It's just sex.</font>

56:28.760 --> 56:30.560
<font color="#ffff00">It's not love.</font>

56:35.840 --> 56:37.440
I know.

56:37.480 --> 56:39.480
<font color="#ffff00">It's good to be clear.</font>

56:44.440 --> 56:46.440
Cos one day you'll be gone and...

56:47.840 --> 56:50.320
..I suppose I'll miss you, that's
all.

56:51.560 --> 56:54.160
<font color="#ffff00">We said "no regrets".</font>

56:54.200 --> 56:56.200
(FRENCH ACCENT) How French.

56:56.240 --> 56:57.840
Degage.

56:57.880 --> 56:59.480
<font color="#ffff00">(Giggles)</font>

57:07.320 --> 57:08.720
<font color="#ffff00">Again?</font>

57:08.760 --> 57:10.560
Oui.

57:16.000 --> 57:18.000
(Thunder rumbles)

57:27.560 --> 57:29.160
Left! Right! Left! Right!

57:29.200 --> 57:32.120
Left! Right! Left! Right!
Left! Right! Left! Right!

57:32.160 --> 57:35.360
Left! Right! Left! Right!
Left! Right! Left...

57:37.120 --> 57:39.120
Steady! Halt!

57:52.160 --> 57:55.480
<font color="#ffff00">Anything further on</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this soldier we've got in custody?</font>

57:55.520 --> 58:00.600
Yes, sir. Strange put it to him that
we recovered
what looks to be the murder weapon.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.640
Rattled him, apparently.

58:02.680 --> 58:06.000
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, in what way?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Went back on his original statement.</font>

58:06.040 --> 58:11.680
Said that after the initial kiss, she
suddenly pulled away from him, gave
him a slap.

58:15.720 --> 58:19.640
Was there anything else, sir?
<font color="#ffff00">Actually, there was one thing.</font>

58:21.760 --> 58:25.200
<font color="#ffff00">I was talking to Mrs Bright last</font>
<font color="#ffff00">night about Charity Mudford.</font>

58:25.240 --> 58:29.880
<font color="#ffff00">She told me she'd heard a rumour</font>
<font color="#ffff00">doing the rounds of Mayfair in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">late '30s,</font>

58:29.920 --> 58:35.840
<font color="#ffff00">Lord Bayswater wasn't Moira</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Creighton-Ward's father at all.</font>

58:42.560 --> 58:44.560
She say who was?

58:46.560 --> 58:51.360
<font color="#ffff00">The gossip was...some young officer</font>
<font color="#ffff00">in the South Oxfordshires.</font>

58:51.400 --> 58:54.760
I imagine Lady Bayswater might have
an idea.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.680
<font color="#ffff00">All come to her now, I suppose?</font>

58:57.720 --> 58:59.280
What will?

59:00.280 --> 59:03.280
<font color="#ffff00">The estate Moira inherited from her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">mother.</font>

59:03.320 --> 59:06.280
<font color="#ffff00">The first Lady Bayswater,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she was the money, apparently.</font>

59:06.320 --> 59:07.920
<font color="#ffff00">No other living relatives.</font>

59:07.960 --> 59:13.000
<font color="#ffff00">When probate goes through,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Charity Mudford will be a very rich</font>
<font color="#ffff00">widow indeed.</font>

59:16.520 --> 59:18.720
Died between midnight and two
o'clock.

59:19.560 --> 59:24.640
Single shot entering the head just
beneath the orbit of the right eye

59:24.680 --> 59:27.160
and exiting along the lambdoid
suture.

59:28.360 --> 59:30.000
Nine-millimetre.

59:30.040 --> 59:32.040
Cartridge just there.

59:33.080 --> 59:35.280
Automatic pistol by the look of
things.

59:45.600 --> 59:47.080
<font color="#ffff00">Who found him?</font>

59:47.120 --> 59:50.920
Sergeant Major Davies had what's left
of C-company out for a run first
thing.

59:50.960 --> 59:56.040
<font color="#ffff00">I've ordered an inventory of all</font>
<font color="#ffff00">side arms on the base, to see if</font>
<font color="#ffff00">there are any unaccounted for.</font>

59:56.080 --> 59:57.680
Is that likely?

59:57.720 --> 01:00:00.800
<font color="#ffff00">All firearms are kept securely</font>
<font color="#ffff00">under lock and key in the armoury.</font>

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:04.600
<font color="#ffff00">Any of us would have to sign in the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">guards room</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and there's been no withdrawal.</font>

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.960
<font color="#ffff00">At least not last night, in any</font>
<font color="#ffff00">event.</font>

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.600
When, then?
<font color="#ffff00">Two days ago.</font>

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:13.680
<font color="#ffff00">Colonel McDuff withdrew a side arm</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for a session on a target range.</font>

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.320
<font color="#ffff00">A Browning L9A1.</font>

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:18.320
Nine-millimetre?
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:22.240
And where is it now?
<font color="#ffff00">It hasn't yet been signed back in.</font>

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:31.120
It'll be about this photographer
laddie? <font color="#ffff00">More or less.</font>

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:33.000
<font color="#ffff00">Wanted to talk to you about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Dr Laidlaw.</font>

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.400
What about him?

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:38.880
<font color="#ffff00">He says he saw you in the officers'</font>
<font color="#ffff00">mess</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the afternoon Jean Ward was killed.</font>

01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.040
<font color="#ffff00">Can you confirm that?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">About five o'clock, would it be?</font>

01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:45.800
<font color="#ffff00">Around then.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Yeah, that sounds about right.</font>

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.520
<font color="#ffff00">You remember him?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Aye.</font>

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.520
Usually drops in about them.
Thinks I'm a soft touch.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.600
<font color="#ffff00">How's that?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Rules of the mess.</font>

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.720
Guests can't sign for their own
drinks, and I'm not one to see a man
go thirsty.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.840
Now, if that's all...
<font color="#ffff00">No, not quite.</font>

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.040
<font color="#ffff00">You signed out a Browning L9A1</font>
<font color="#ffff00">from the armoury two days ago.</font>

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.880
Aye. What of it?
<font color="#ffff00">Where is it?</font>

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:08.560
It's back in the armoury. I signed
it in straight after practice.

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:11.360
<font color="#ffff00">No, you didn't.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">I'm sure I did.</font>

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:15.800
I remember taking it back. I signed
it out, signed it in,
same as always.

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.400
Swear to God.
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe you thought you did,</font>

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:22.240
<font color="#ffff00">but, if you had, then it would be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">there, wouldn't it?</font>

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.840
You can't think I had anything to do
with that photographer...

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:29.480
..or the sweet lassie.

01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:32.480
You said yourself I've an alibi.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.840
Laidlaw saw me.
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe he was mistaken.</font>

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.360
No. No, I saw him, I swear it.

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:41.480
<font color="#ffff00">Same way you swore you put</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the pistol back in the armoury?</font>

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:46.200
<font color="#ffff00">What exactly were you doing creeping</font>
<font color="#ffff00">around the barracks last night?</font>

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.920
I don't know.
(Knocking on door)

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.960
Gentlemen, if you've a moment...

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.080
Sometimes the men come through the
wire,

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.200
if they've been out on a late pass,
missed the last bus,

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:06.720
rather than finding themselves
on a charge.

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:12.720
<font color="#ffff00">We repair any breaches we find,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but it's a large perimeter and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">pretty porous.</font>

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.760
You put a sentry on this
till we've got Forensics out.

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.800
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, of course.</font>

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:29.280
(Sighs) Looks like it puts Private
Oswald in the clear at any rate.

01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:35.800
<font color="#ffff00">For this, but not for Moira</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Creighton-Ward.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">You've changed your tune.</font>

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.560
<font color="#ffff00">I told you, I'm just trying to keep</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an open mind.</font>

01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:42.840
Two killers on the base?
They're connected, surely.

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:44.760
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe, maybe not.</font>

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.480
<font color="#ffff00">Interesting.</font>

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.520
<font color="#ffff00">Farridge was at the protest too.</font>

01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.480
So Farridge is in with
these "Make love not war" types.

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.920
<font color="#ffff00">I can't see how he'd find anyone</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sympathetic to that on the base.</font>

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.800
Maybe he found someone
who felt the exact opposite.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:11.960
<font color="#ffff00">Wandering around that late at night?</font>

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.720
Perhaps it was Creighton-Ward's
killer. <font color="#ffff00">Going back to the scene of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the crime?</font>

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.920
Could have had unfinished business
up there.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:21.960
Something he'd forgotten, something
he'd left behind and could
incriminate him.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.440
<font color="#ffff00">OK, if it wasn't Private Oswald,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">then who?</font>

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.560
Private Collier who found the murder
weapon,

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.400
Lieutenant Carmichael
who ordered the wash house swabbed

01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:32.680
and Sergeant Major Davies
who set Collier and Sam to cleaning.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.160
<font color="#ffff00">What about this run-in you had with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">McDuff? </font><font color="#ffffff">Oh, he's a law unto himself.</font>

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.600
He's held in high regard
by the rest of the officers.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:41.480
A regimental hero.
<font color="#ffff00">Think they're protecting him?</font>

01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.680
I think that when he had his knife
in my back, its point was between
my fourth and fifth ribs.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.640
<font color="#ffff00">Same as Moira. </font><font color="#ffffff">Mm, same as Moira,</font>
<font color="#ffffff">but it is textbook,</font>

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:50.360
they taught us that much in Signals.

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.600
<font color="#ffff00">And he'd signed out this Browning</font>
<font color="#ffff00">nine-mil.</font>

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.480
But Laidlaw can stand alibi
for the time of Moira's killing.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.440
He says he saw him in the officers'
mess.

01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.480
<font color="#ffff00">What if McDuff didn't kill the girl,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">but did kill Farridge?</font>

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:03.480
<font color="#ffff00">Two murders, two killers, two</font>
<font color="#ffff00">different motives?</font>

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.520
Division are after an answer
on Oswald.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.040
We must charge him by the end of the
day or release him.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.240
<font color="#ffff00">It's under review, sir, what with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the killing of this photographer</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Farridge,</font>

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.880
<font color="#ffff00">it looks like the killer could still</font>
<font color="#ffff00">be on the base.</font>

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.640
Fresh off the Telex from Dr DeBryn
on the bayonet.

01:04:17.680 --> 01:04:19.600
<font color="#ffff00">Thank you.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Sir.</font>

01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.880
<font color="#ffff00">Constable Trewlove, good heavens!</font>
<font color="#ffff00">What's happened to you?</font>

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:26.080
Yesterday's public disorder, sir.

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:29.760
<font color="#ffff00">Well, bruised or not, your ready</font>
<font color="#ffff00">smile brightens our drab walls</font>

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.240
<font color="#ffff00">with much needed vim and youthful</font>
<font color="#ffff00">freshness.</font>

01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:35.480
<font color="#ffff00">Wouldn't you say so, Fancy?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Yes, sir.</font>

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.240
<font color="#ffff00">There's a blood match on</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the weapon used to kill Moira,</font>

01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.160
<font color="#ffff00">but it's not a regulation army</font>
<font color="#ffff00">bayonet. </font><font color="#ffffff">No? What, then?</font>

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:46.520
<font color="#ffff00">According to Dr DeBryn,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it was made for the K98 rifle,</font>

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.280
<font color="#ffff00">standard Wehrmacht issue.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">German.</font>

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:53.320
<font color="#ffff00">Well, her stepmother's certainly got</font>
<font color="#ffff00">German connections.</font>

01:04:56.360 --> 01:05:00.560
<font color="#ffff00">"In and out each other's beds</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and at it like knives," according to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Mrs Bright.</font>

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.920
<font color="#ffff00">No wonder the upper classes</font>
<font color="#ffff00">are obsessed with pedigree.</font>

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.360
<font color="#ffff00">Lady Bayswater.</font>

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.080
<font color="#ffff00">We're rather hoping you can help us.</font>

01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.520
<font color="#ffff00">We've come into information that</font>
<font color="#ffff00">raises questions about your</font>
<font color="#ffff00">stepdaughter's parentage.</font>

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:18.200
Policemen! What a grubby trade
you practise.

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.960
If my husband were alive,
you wouldn't dare ask such a thing.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.080
<font color="#ffff00">It may have a bearing on her death.</font>

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:27.200
What utter nonsense.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.280
This is nothing short of persecution.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.040
<font color="#ffff00">Persecution? Spare me. You got off</font>
<font color="#ffff00">light.</font>

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:38.000
<font color="#ffff00">Your husband should've hanged, with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Spode and Webley and the rest of his</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Fascist shower.</font>

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:41.120
<font color="#ffff00">You've got the nerve to have</font>
<font color="#ffff00">something like that on display.</font>

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:46.600
I can't change the past. You know,
if Winston hadn't been so eager for
office,

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.200
all the unpleasantness
might have been avoided.

01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.600
My husband had Hitler's ear.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.200
We could've persuaded him.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.560
Softened his resolve.

01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:01.480
He wasn't immune to reason. <font color="#ffff00">Charming</font>
<font color="#ffff00">conversationalist, no doubt.</font>

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.920
(LAUGHS)
Actually, he was a very good mimic.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.200
Terribly witty.

01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:09.360
<font color="#ffff00">Sir, is it time for that telephone</font>
<font color="#ffff00">call to the station?</font>

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.640
<font color="#ffff00">I can take it from here.</font>

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:18.800
The "unpleasantness" as you call it

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:21.240
cost me six years of my life...

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.520
..and untold millions
a great deal more.

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.680
(Door slams)

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:34.960
<font color="#ffff00">May I?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Mm.</font>

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:43.280
<font color="#ffff00">I understand, as Moira's sole living</font>
<font color="#ffff00">relative, you stand to inherit</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the entirety of her estate.</font>

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.800
What are you insinuating?

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.800
<font color="#ffff00">Money's a very powerful motivator.</font>

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:48.800
To the common vulgarity.

01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:50.840
Now, is that all?
<font color="#ffff00">Not quite.</font>

01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:55.520
<font color="#ffff00">It's been suggested Moira's father</font>
<font color="#ffff00">was an officer in the South</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Oxfordshire regiment.</font>

01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:57.840
<font color="#ffff00">If you know who that was, I'd like</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to hear it.</font>

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.320
Why should I tell you people
anything?

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:03.520
Another time, another place,

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:07.040
I could've had both of you shot,
just like that.

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.080
Snap of my fingers. (Clicks fingers)

01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.120
<font color="#ffff00">Well, that was then, this is now.</font>

01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:14.280
<font color="#ffff00">If you'd like to see a penny of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">your stepdaughter's inheritance,</font>

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:16.720
<font color="#ffff00">you will co-operate with us fully.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Is that clear?</font>

01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:22.480
You been with her long?

01:07:22.520 --> 01:07:24.640
<font color="#ffff00">20-odd years.</font>

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.080
Admirer of her husband, were you?

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:34.000
<font color="#ffff00">No man is a hero to his valet, sir,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it's a job, like anything else.</font>

01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:36.040
What was Moira like?

01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.640
<font color="#ffff00">An unhappy girl.</font>

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.840
<font color="#ffff00">She suffered terribly at boarding</font>
<font color="#ffff00">school over her father.</font>

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:44.680
<font color="#ffff00">That was here in Oxfordshire,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">funnily enough.</font>

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.120
There any talk about who the real
father was?

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:49.160
<font color="#ffff00">The real father?</font>

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.200
<font color="#ffff00">I always took it to be</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Lord Bayswater, sir.</font>

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.080
<font color="#ffff00">It's an awful thing.</font>

01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:58.240
<font color="#ffff00">I was very fond of her...in my way.</font>

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.440
What way was that, Mr Barker?

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:04.920
<font color="#ffff00">One that knows its place and proper</font>
<font color="#ffff00">station, Chief Inspector.</font>

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.680
But there was no love lost
between her and her stepmother?

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:12.200
<font color="#ffff00">I'm afraid I couldn't speak to that,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sir. </font><font color="#ffffff">But you could speak as to her</font>
<font color="#ffffff">whereabouts</font>

01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:16.080
on the afternoon following her
appearance at the debating society?

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.920
<font color="#ffff00">She was here, sir.</font>

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.840
You can vouch for that?

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:24.000
<font color="#ffff00">I had some small errands to run in</font>
<font color="#ffff00">town for an hour or two, but she was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">here when I left...</font>

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.160
<font color="#ffff00">..and upon my return.</font>

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:33.439
Moira's grandfather was Commanding
Officer in the South Oxfordshire
Regiment in the '30s.

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:38.080
Two of his favourites were regular
house guests here - Mungo Coward and
Johnny Champion.

01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.120
<font color="#ffff00">Major Coward and Colonel Champion?</font>

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.279
She thought it could be either of
them.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:44.720
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe the girl had heard the rumours</font>

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:48.160
<font color="#ffff00">and took it upon herself to confront</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the man she believed to be her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">father.</font>

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.600
But which of them? The regiment
leaves for Germany this evening.

01:08:51.640 --> 01:08:55.319
Unless we can identify him, Moira's
killer - whoever it is - leaves with
them.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.760
<font color="#ffff00">I've been given to understand</font>

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:19.640
<font color="#ffff00">that you and Major Coward were</font>
<font color="#ffff00">regular guests at Colonel</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Proserpine's family estate...</font>

01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:23.680
<font color="#ffff00">..where his daughter Eleanor was</font>
<font color="#ffff00">often staying.</font>

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.720
I can imagine what this is about.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.160
The question you're here to ask,
I can't answer. I simply don't know.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:33.080
<font color="#ffff00">You admit to a closeness with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Moira Creighton-Ward's mother, then?</font>

01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:35.760
<font color="#ffff00">And you, Major?</font>

01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:41.279
Mungo was only ever a friend to
Eleanor, a good friend to her, and
brother officer to me.

01:09:42.359 --> 01:09:44.560
<font color="#ffff00">But you knew about their</font>
<font color="#ffff00">relationship?</font>

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:48.319
Eleanor was a wonderful girl. We all
knew what Paddy Creighton-Ward was.

01:09:48.359 --> 01:09:51.560
<font color="#ffff00">He took no pains to hide his</font>
<font color="#ffff00">adultery with Charity Mudford.</font>

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:56.120
No pains? He was brazen about it.
All London knew what they were up to.

01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.240
<font color="#ffff00">Yes, but was he still sleeping with</font>
<font color="#ffff00">his wife?</font>

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.400
It wasn't something we discussed.

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:08.080
We had our time and then Eleanor said
it might be best not to see each
other again,

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.000
so she ended our relationship.

01:10:12.040 --> 01:10:17.600
Anyway, seven, eight months later,
I saw it in the papers, the gift of
a daughter.

01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:20.600
<font color="#ffff00">But did she make contact with you?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Moira? No.</font>

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.960
<font color="#ffff00">So you'd no idea it was her</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when she came to the base?</font>

01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:28.440
I suppose, if she'd used her real
name, I might have thought something
of it.

01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:31.280
Moira, you see, is my mother's name.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:34.600
<font color="#ffff00">Surely, that was a sign she was your</font>
<font color="#ffff00">daughter. </font><font color="#ffffff">It could've been,</font>

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.200
but it could just as easily have been
Paddy Creighton-Ward's idea of
a joke.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.760
Let him wonder.

01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:42.600
Now I'll never know.

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:55.160
<font color="#ffff00">No surprises as to cause of death,</font>

01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.200
<font color="#ffff00">but the cartridge is unusual.</font>

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.520
<font color="#ffff00">If you find anything like it</font>
<font color="#ffff00">on the base, I'd be surprised.</font>

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.080
<font color="#ffff00">Head stamp gives its date, lot</font>
<font color="#ffff00">number, as well as case metal code.</font>

01:11:04.120 --> 01:11:07.160
"44"?
<font color="#ffff00">1944, to be precise.</font>

01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.840
<font color="#ffff00">German military.</font>

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:14.480
A K98 bayonet and a pistol
both used by the Wehrmacht?

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:16.320
<font color="#ffff00">Yes.</font>

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.960
<font color="#ffff00">Souvenir, perhaps.</font>

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.920
<font color="#ffff00">The spoils of war.</font>

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.840
<font color="#ffff00">It wasn't unknown for soldiers to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">relieve prisoners and the dead of</font>
<font color="#ffff00">their arms.</font>

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:36.560
THURSDAY: Mr Barker, what can I do
for you?

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.520
<font color="#ffff00">I didn't say anything when you came,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it seemed like a betrayal,</font>

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:44.920
<font color="#ffff00">but she wrote to me - Moira.</font>

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.320
<font color="#ffff00">Had done since she was at boarding</font>
<font color="#ffff00">school.</font>

01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.320
<font color="#ffff00">That's the last.</font>

01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:54.040
<font color="#ffff00">Last few months, she's been happy.</font>

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.080
<font color="#ffff00">She met someone.</font>

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.160
<font color="#ffff00">I don't know if there was anything</font>
<font color="#ffff00">more to it than...hero worship,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I suppose,</font>

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.760
<font color="#ffff00">but he'd certainly made</font>
<font color="#ffff00">an impression on her. </font><font color="#ffffff">Who had?</font>

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.040
(Groovy rock blues music)

01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:34.680
Marcus.

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.600
<font color="#ffff00">Marcus Williams?</font>

01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.480
Marcus X.

01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:45.320
<font color="#ffff00">Is that right?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">The X represents my true name.</font>

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.640
My ancestral African name.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:53.600
<font color="#ffff00">Well, since we're all on first name</font>
<font color="#ffff00">terms, Fred do you? This is Morse.</font>

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.600
Please.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.760
<font color="#ffff00">We'd like to talk to you about</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Jean Ward.</font>

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.360
(Clicks fingers)

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.520
(Door closes)
What about her?

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.200
<font color="#ffff00">You were involved.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Politically, yes.</font>

01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:17.760
She was looking for a cause.
Something to believe in.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:21.000
<font color="#ffff00">Something or someone?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Sometimes it's the same thing,</font>

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.680
but that's as far as it went.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:25.560
<font color="#ffff00">Where were you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when Miss Ward was at the barracks?</font>

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:29.400
Here, and later at a protest

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.840
outside a hair salon in East Cowley
that operates a colour-bar.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:35.480
I have at least 20 witnesses
can vouch for my movements.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.240
<font color="#ffff00">You know a man called Farridge,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a photographer?</font>

01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:42.800
Yeah, I know him. He does pictures.
Chronicles the struggle.

01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:44.720
<font color="#ffff00">When did you see him last?</font>

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:48.400
After Jean died, he came by to tell
me. Why?

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.360
<font color="#ffff00">Somebody shot him last night, up at</font>
<font color="#ffff00">High Wood.</font>

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.520
Well, you...you can't pin that one
on me.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:04.760
I was in a cell at Cowley Police
Station until first thing.

01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.240
<font color="#ffff00">Any idea why he went back up to</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the barracks?</font>

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.000
Er...

01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:17.480
He'd called...to say that one of you
had arrested a brother for it.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.040
Maybe he had other ideas.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.440
And Jean...

01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:25.920
<font color="#ffff00">Can you think of anyone</font>
<font color="#ffff00">who would wish her harm?</font>

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:30.880
It wasn't easy for her,
being her father's daughter,

01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:33.400
but she put all that behind her.

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:37.680
Changed her name and started over.
<font color="#ffff00">Something you had in common.</font>

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.920
She was a beautiful soul.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:45.520
Had she lived, her future would've
been as bright as her past was...
shadowed.

01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.720
I'd have seen to it.

01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:56.240
<font color="#ffff00">What do you make to him?</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Could he be right about Farridge?</font>

01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.280
The Convergence Of The Twain.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:01.880
He goes to find out what happened to
Jean and gets more than he bargained
for?

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.600
<font color="#ffff00">Happened since then.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Could Champion be lying?</font>

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:07.800
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe Jean contacted him,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">told him she was coming.</font>

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.360
It's a hell of a leap from that to
killing someone
you believe to be your own daughter.

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.600
<font color="#ffff00">Double-check Williams' alibi</font>
<font color="#ffff00">for the time of Jean's killing</font>

01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:17.640
<font color="#ffff00">and take a run down to the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">hairdresser's.</font>

01:15:17.680 --> 01:15:19.680
<font color="#ffff00">See if you can dig anything else</font>
<font color="#ffff00">up there.</font>

01:15:19.720 --> 01:15:24.040
<font color="#ffff00">I'll walk back to the nick, see what</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Mr Bright wants to do with Private</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Oswald.</font>

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:30.600
Is this the man you saw
leading the protest?

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:33.520
<font color="#ffff00">To tell you the truth, dear,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">I couldn't swear to it.</font>

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:38.800
<font color="#ffff00">I'm sure their mothers can tell them</font>
<font color="#ffff00">apart, but, er, don't ask me, dear,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">cos I'd be at a loss.</font>

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.560
Right. Thank you.

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:46.520
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, yes. She's very popular.</font>

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.480
<font color="#ffff00">The face that launched 1,000 snips.</font>

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:54.280
<font color="#ffff00">But I'm afraid she's spoken for,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">if you had any designs of your own.</font>

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.320
How do you mean?

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.480
<font color="#ffff00">I've a gentleman buys all the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">blow-ups of her off me</font>
<font color="#ffff00">when I'm done.</font>

01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:02.520
<font color="#ffff00">None of the other girls, just her.</font>

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:06.080
<font color="#ffff00">I must have let him have half a</font>
<font color="#ffff00">dozen, the last couple of years.</font>

01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:09.240
<font color="#ffff00">He just comes in every month or two</font>
<font color="#ffff00">and I put them by for him.</font>

<font color="#ffff00">I suppose.</font>

01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.840
<font color="#ffff00">When it comes to men, dear,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it doesn't do to judge.</font>

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.200
What's his name?
<font color="#ffff00">I couldn't tell you, I'm afraid.</font>

01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:24.080
He wouldn't wear glasses, by any
chance?

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.920
(Knocking on door)

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.880
I was hoping to find Dr Laidlaw.

01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:45.400
<font color="#ffff00">You and me both. He must be up at</font>
<font color="#ffff00">the camp playing soldiers.</font>

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.800
Have you got a permit for that?
<font color="#ffff00">I wouldn't have.</font>

01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:52.760
Well, then, put it down.
<font color="#ffff00">It's not mine, it's his.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">He collects this crap.</font>

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.680
<font color="#ffff00">Got all sorts - pistols, rifles,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">swords, flags.</font>

01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:58.560

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.040

<font color="#ffff00">When he bothers to turn up.</font>

01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:32.120
What do you know about him?

01:17:32.160 --> 01:17:34.560
<font color="#ffff00">Beside his interest in Nazi regalia?</font>

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.400
I mean, is he married? Single?

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:40.400
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, he's married.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">Some model, he says.</font>

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:42.440
How's that?

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.760
<font color="#ffff00">Got a couple of kids together,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a place in north Oxford.</font>

He won't be coming in today.
<font color="#ffff00">He might.</font>

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.480
He won't. Go on, get out before I run

That's what you didn't like about
him?

01:21:23.960 --> 01:21:27.400
You could've chosen anyone, but you
chose to frame Private Oswald.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.800
<font color="#ffff00">What does it matter? They're all the</font>
<font color="#ffff00">same!</font>

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:32.360
<font color="#ffff00">Bloody savages! Animals!</font>

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.600
LAIDLAW: I saw him kissing her in the
woods.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:37.800
<font color="#ffff00">MORSE: You saw her kissing him.</font>

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:41.200
I know what I saw.
<font color="#ffff00">She was drugged up.</font>

01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:43.360
<font color="#ffff00">Didn't know what she was doing</font>
<font color="#ffff00">half the time.</font>

01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.880
<font color="#ffff00">Did you see her belt him?</font>

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.280
(Clattering)
What?

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:53.280
<font color="#ffff00">She slapped him, same way I think</font>
<font color="#ffff00">she slapped you when you confronted</font>
<font color="#ffff00">her.</font>

01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.000
<font color="#ffff00">MORSE: She knocked your specs off.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Moira!</font>

01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.880
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, leave me alone!</font>
<font color="#ffffff">You came here...</font>

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.600
<font color="#ffff00">Get off me!</font>
<font color="#ffffff">(Grunts)</font>

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.880
<font color="#ffff00">MORSE: Hit you so hard,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it dislodged the screw from the arm.</font>

01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.120
<font color="#ffff00">You bodged it together</font>
<font color="#ffff00">with a running repair</font>

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.480
<font color="#ffff00">but, if somebody found that screw,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">it could tie you to Jean's murder.</font>

01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:18.720
<font color="#ffff00">You came up here last night looking</font>
<font color="#ffff00">to find it,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">only, you ran into Farridge.</font>

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:23.240
<font color="#ffff00">Maybe he recognised you, so you</font>
<font color="#ffff00">killed him.</font>

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.440
He deserved it!

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:30.560
He's part of that Marxist shower with
Williams.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:34.760
Well, he won't be pointing his camera
at anybody else persecuting people.
Ah!

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:09.520
<font color="#ffff00">Now, then, Mr Laidlaw, what's all</font>
<font color="#ffff00">this shooting?</font>

01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:12.800
Doctor Laidlaw.

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:14.000
<font color="#ffff00">(Grunts)</font>

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.440
(Gun cocking)

01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:23.520
(Gunshot)

01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:55.240
(Warped, muffled humming sound)

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:09.680
(Clicking)

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.480
(Bugle plays The Last Post)

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.960
<font color="#ffff00">Easy, Jack, easy.</font>

01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:36.000
<font color="#ffff00">Medics are on their way.</font>

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:38.120
They'll not take the regiment.

01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:42.880
Do you see them, Mungo?

01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.080
All my bright boys.
<font color="#ffff00">I see them, Jack.</font>

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:52.080
The Colours, man.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.160
Look to the Colours.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.920
Save the Colours.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.000
<font color="#ffff00">Oh, my laddie.</font>

01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:17.320
<font color="#ffff00">My...bonnie, brave laddie.</font>

01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.960
(Chuckles)

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.000
<font color="#ffff00">"I didn't do it, Corp."</font>
<font color="#ffffff">(Laughs)</font>

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.280
(Indistinct chatter)

01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:50.360
Off, then?
<font color="#ffff00">Uh-huh.</font>

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.560
<font color="#ffff00">You did it.</font>

01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:55.200
It was done.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:57.960
<font color="#ffff00">Dad...</font>
<font color="#ffffff">Go and join your mates</font>

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.920
and make sure you write your mother.

01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:06.000
Unless they've changed King's Regs,
you don't salute NCOs.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.600
<font color="#ffff00">I'm not.</font>

01:26:09.800 --> 01:26:11.400
Dismissed, son.

01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:40.480
That's that, then, Colonel.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.520
Parade's end.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:47.560
<font color="#ffff00">Our regimental record unblemished,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">honour preserved, thanks to you and</font>
<font color="#ffff00">your men.</font>

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.280
My boy'll be sorry to see it go.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.920
<font color="#ffff00">Ah, it's just a name.</font>

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:55.160
<font color="#ffff00">Names change.</font>
<font color="#ffffff">That's true enough.</font>

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:59.440
We began the year as City Police
and we'll end it as Thames Valley.

01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.520
It's people make something what it
is, not the name it's called by.

01:27:02.560 --> 01:27:04.000
<font color="#ffff00">Thanks.</font>

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:09.720
And as long as the Colours remain
and there's one man left to see
they don't fall to shame,

01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.960
a regiment never truly dies.

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:15.920
Thank you.

01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.960
Goodbye.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.760
(Engine starts)

01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:24.800
(Vehicle drives off)

01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:29.160
<font color="#ffff00">Over 20 years since I was on</font>
<font color="#ffff00">a barracks square.</font>

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.200
<font color="#ffff00">Could've been yesterday.</font>

01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:39.200
<font color="#ffff00">Nothing changes.</font>
<font color="#ffff00">They all look the same,</font>
<font color="#ffff00">sound the same, smell the same.</font>

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:44.600
<font color="#ffff00">Today, we have naming of parts.</font>

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.640
<font color="#ffff00">Yesterday we had daily cleaning...</font>

01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:58.600
<font color="#ffff00">..and tomorrow morning we shall</font>
<font color="#ffff00">have, "What to do after firing".</font>

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.880
<font color="#ffff00">But today...</font>

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.400
<font color="#ffff00">..today, we have naming of parts.</font>

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.560
<font color="#ffff00">What do you reckon to Laidlaw, then?</font>

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:24.560
I think he couldn't let her go.
<font color="#ffff00">Yeah, that'll do it every time.</font>

01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.200
<font color="#ffff00">How's your head?</font>
<font color="#ffffff">(Exhales sharply) Ringing.</font>

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.200
<font color="#ffff00">If you will get yourself shot at...</font>

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000
<font color="#ffff00">You did all right.</font>

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:38.440
<font color="#ffff00">Knew you would.</font>

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.120
Do you want to drive?
<font color="#ffff00">Go on, then.</font>
