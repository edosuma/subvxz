WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:06.498
<i>We haven't met, and that's okay</i>

00:06.575 --> 00:09.942
<i>'Cause you will be</i>
<i>asking for me one day</i>

00:14.349 --> 00:16.647
You'll never take me alive, coppers!

00:19.922 --> 00:23.119
<i>Don't want to wait in line</i>

00:23.192 --> 00:26.025
<i>The moment is mine, believe me</i>

00:28.664 --> 00:32.225
Out of the way, Grandma,
got the po-po on my tail.

00:33.735 --> 00:37.068
Jackson, I'm trying to rehearse
for the American Teen Music Awards.

00:37.139 --> 00:40.302
Yeah. Yeah, don't worry,
you're not bothering me.

00:41.276 --> 00:45.007
- But you're bothering me.
- Oh, right.

00:45.881 --> 00:47.314
Don't care.

00:48.383 --> 00:49.907
Look out, cow!

00:53.388 --> 00:57.017
Look at that heifer fly.
Right into the marching band!

01:00.929 --> 01:04.364
Hey, Jackson, you know,
you have a real car.

01:04.433 --> 01:07.527
Here's a thought.
Get in it and drive away.

01:09.037 --> 01:12.598
Well, I would if I had real gas,
which costs real money

01:12.674 --> 01:15.666
which Rico doesn't pay me a real lot of.

01:15.744 --> 01:17.473
Ask Rico for a raise.

01:17.546 --> 01:19.537
Ask for a raise.

01:20.415 --> 01:23.543
Gee, that sounds like a good idea.

01:23.619 --> 01:25.746
Oh, wait. I did.

01:26.588 --> 01:27.919
It's not gonna happen.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.982
Rico's vicious, ruthless
and completely inflexible.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074

02:00.689 --> 02:03.055
He looks pretty flexible to me.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.895
To me, he looks like
a very lonely munchkin.

02:08.663 --> 02:10.495
Well, Jackson can't leave the house

02:10.565 --> 02:12.556
unless that munchkin
gives him a raise.

02:12.634 --> 02:15.467
Then maybe finally,
I can get some rehearsing done.

02:15.537 --> 02:17.562
Wish me luck.

02:17.639 --> 02:20.472
Remember,
follow the yellow brick road.

02:23.011 --> 02:25.809
Hey, Rico, that is one lucky broom.

02:26.481 --> 02:29.211
Can it, toots. I'm working on my tango.

02:31.086 --> 02:34.920
- Have you gotten taller?
- Your brother's not getting a raise.

02:35.524 --> 02:37.754
I wasn't going to say that.

02:37.826 --> 02:41.819
- Okay, fine, I was. But...
- All right, I'll make you a deal, honey.

02:41.897 --> 02:43.990
I'll ask my dad to give him a raise,

02:44.066 --> 02:47.365
if you'll be my dance partner
for my ballroom dance competition.

02:47.436 --> 02:51.770
- Ballroom dancing?
- Laugh all you want. Chicks dig it.

02:53.809 --> 02:55.436
And I dig chicks.

02:57.512 --> 02:58.536
So, what do you say?

02:58.613 --> 03:00.478
You wash my back,
I wash your brother's.

03:00.549 --> 03:01.573
Okay, first...

03:03.151 --> 03:06.587
And second, I think it's
"scratch my back. " And third...

03:09.758 --> 03:11.385
Fine. No dance partner, no raise.

03:11.460 --> 03:14.156
Okay, fine, then no more smiley Miley.

03:15.230 --> 03:17.824
Listen here, bub, my brother's sick
of being pushed around by you,

03:17.899 --> 03:20.026
and he ain't gonna work here anymore
unless you give him a raise.

03:20.102 --> 03:22.366
- Okay, okay, you win.
- I do?

03:22.437 --> 03:24.302
Yeah. He's fired.

03:25.474 --> 03:26.702
Really?

03:32.881 --> 03:34.405
<i> Come on!</i>

03:34.483 --> 03:37.008
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

03:38.520 --> 03:41.853
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe, every color</i>

03:41.957 --> 03:45.825
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

03:45.894 --> 03:49.921
<i>It's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

03:50.899 --> 03:54.232
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

03:54.302 --> 03:59.535
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

03:59.608 --> 04:03.442
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

04:03.512 --> 04:05.571
<i>Chill it out, take it slow</i>

04:05.647 --> 04:07.205
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

04:07.282 --> 04:11.719
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

04:11.787 --> 04:13.345
<i>Mix it all together</i>

04:13.422 --> 04:16.357
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>It's the best of both worlds</i>

04:22.697 --> 04:24.790
Hey, Jackson, where you going?

04:24.866 --> 04:29.599
Well, I was heading to Jessica Alba's
for movies and kettle corn,

04:31.006 --> 04:33.167
but then I decided
I'd rather spend six hours

04:33.241 --> 04:35.038
making minimum wage at Rico's.

04:36.445 --> 04:39.107
Wait, wait. You know what?
I've been thinking.

04:39.181 --> 04:42.639
And you are right. That little runt
doesn't pay you enough.

04:42.717 --> 04:43.809
I think you should quit.

04:43.885 --> 04:46.012
- I'm not gonna quit.
- You're right!

04:46.088 --> 04:50.616
He isn't worth your time or trouble.
I'll quit for you.

04:50.692 --> 04:53.593
- Miley...
- No need to thank me, brother.

04:53.662 --> 04:55.459
That's why we're here.

04:55.530 --> 04:58.158
Miles? What did you do?

04:58.233 --> 04:59.359
Well...

05:00.168 --> 05:02.796
See, I may have asked Rico
to give you a raise,

05:02.871 --> 05:05.533
and it may have not
gone as well as I'd hoped.

05:05.607 --> 05:09.270
Oh, great, what did that
little weasel do? Cut back my hours?

05:10.045 --> 05:11.603
Just a tad.

05:16.918 --> 05:19.785
Don't worry, Jackson,
as soon as Rico sees

05:19.855 --> 05:23.951
how dead this place is without you
he'll beg for you to come back.

05:26.628 --> 05:27.993
Or not.

05:29.831 --> 05:32.766
What happened?
How did it get so busy?

05:32.834 --> 05:35.394
Simple. I brought in a professional.

05:43.578 --> 05:47.776
Here you are.
Two fresh waters for miladies.

05:50.385 --> 05:51.579
I gotta tell you,

05:51.653 --> 05:55.851
getting rid of this piece of seaweed
was the best thing I ever did.

05:58.093 --> 06:00.288
Look, Rico, I want my job back.

06:00.362 --> 06:02.296
Again with the lifting!

06:03.765 --> 06:06.131
Look, I'm sorry, this wasn't my fault.

06:06.201 --> 06:07.759
He's right. It was mine.

06:07.836 --> 06:10.600
There's got to be something I can do.

06:10.672 --> 06:12.663
Hey, do you still need a dance partner?

06:12.741 --> 06:14.606
Too late, angel face.

06:18.813 --> 06:22.340
This is Carmen. She's from Argentina.

06:23.952 --> 06:26.182
Land of Tango.

06:30.125 --> 06:34.027
Great.
Thanks to you, I'm from Flatbroke,

06:35.564 --> 06:38.328
the land of unemployment.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.738
Oh, yeah. Man, this jalopy races

06:47.809 --> 06:51.210
faster than Uncle Earl's heart
at a Shakira concert!

06:52.147 --> 06:54.809
- I can't believe this!
- I'm not playing it.

06:54.883 --> 06:57.317
I'm just making sure
it's age appropriate

06:57.385 --> 06:59.649
like any good parent should.

06:59.721 --> 07:03.680
- Jackson, I'm sorry.
- Sorry doesn't pay the bills, sister.

07:03.758 --> 07:06.192
No, that would be me.

07:06.261 --> 07:08.161
Somebody want to tell me
what's going on here?

07:08.230 --> 07:10.858
- I just got fired.
- Oh, no, Jackson.

07:10.932 --> 07:12.957
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

07:13.034 --> 07:14.934
- You did.
- Me?

07:15.003 --> 07:17.130
Yeah, you had to have a second kid,

07:17.205 --> 07:19.435
and now little miss bigmouth
just got me fired.

07:19.507 --> 07:23.341
- Is that true, Mile?
- Dad, I was just trying to help.

07:23.411 --> 07:26.278
And besides, Jackson,
I said I was sorry.

07:26.348 --> 07:28.646
What else do you want from me?

07:28.717 --> 07:30.275
I don't know...

07:31.019 --> 07:32.748
A job?

07:32.821 --> 07:36.518
I'm a kid!
How am I supposed to get you a job?

07:36.591 --> 07:38.456
Unless you want to be like

07:38.526 --> 07:41.017
Hannah Montana's
assistant or something.

07:41.096 --> 07:42.563
- I'll take it.
- What?

07:42.631 --> 07:45.532
- The job. It's perfect.
- No. No, it's not.

07:45.600 --> 07:49.866
I'm your little, bigmouthed sister.
You don't want to be my assistant.

07:49.938 --> 07:52.634
You're right. Assistant is demeaning.

07:53.908 --> 07:58.106
Let's go with
Senior Vice President in charge of

07:58.179 --> 07:59.874
Assistication.

07:59.948 --> 08:01.347
I'll start tomorrow at 9:00.

08:01.416 --> 08:02.849
Wait, better make that 10:00.

08:02.917 --> 08:05.681
I gotta get me some
business cards made.

08:08.923 --> 08:10.720
What just happened?

08:10.792 --> 08:14.694
I just hit an armadillo,
and Hannah just got herself

08:14.763 --> 08:17.527
a new Senior Vice President
of Assistication.

08:17.599 --> 08:19.328
But I don't need an assisticant!

08:19.401 --> 08:22.427
Well, you should've thought of that
before you offered him the job.

08:22.504 --> 08:24.768
- This is a horrible idea.
- Yeah. Probably is.

08:24.839 --> 08:27.000
Guess you better
get up there and fire him.

08:27.075 --> 08:29.839
Dad, I can't!
I already cost him one job today,

08:29.911 --> 08:33.539
I can't fire him from another.
That would be awful.

08:33.615 --> 08:34.741
You do it.

08:34.816 --> 08:38.115
Oh, no. You made this mess,
you gotta go up there and clean it up.

08:38.186 --> 08:40.916
But, Daddy, I can't.

08:40.989 --> 08:43.355
- That's the deal, bud.
- Okay.

08:44.192 --> 08:45.454
Okay, fine.

08:45.527 --> 08:49.088
I'm gonna go up there
and tell him. I can be strong.

08:49.164 --> 08:53.794
I'm gonna go up there and say...
Daddy, please, help me, bail me out.

08:53.868 --> 08:56.393
Do I always have to learn something?

08:57.005 --> 09:00.168
Honey, I'm just trying to teach you
how to be a mature adult.

09:00.241 --> 09:03.074
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I got a po-po roadblock in front of me

09:03.144 --> 09:05.908
and an army of evil turkeys on my tail.

09:13.788 --> 09:16.689
Jackson, come on, where's the limo?

09:16.758 --> 09:18.988
We're gonna be late for
the CD signing!

09:19.060 --> 09:21.551
Chillax.
I'm on it right now, boss!

09:22.831 --> 09:25.800
Wow, Jackson is your assistant.

09:26.368 --> 09:28.893
This is a horrible idea.

09:28.970 --> 09:31.234
I'm talking your
dad's old mullet horrible.

09:31.306 --> 09:32.295
Lilly.

09:32.374 --> 09:35.969
I know. "It was a different time,
the chicks dug it. "

09:36.044 --> 09:37.534
Lilly, stop.

09:38.346 --> 09:41.076
Right. We were talking about
you hiring Jackson.

09:41.149 --> 09:43.583
Horrible, horrible, horrible.

09:44.619 --> 09:47.349
Lilly, I'm trying to give
Jackson a chance.

09:47.422 --> 09:48.446
I mean, it's the least I can do.

09:48.523 --> 09:51.287
And besides,
I could use a little support here.

09:51.359 --> 09:53.384
You're right. You're being
a very good sister.

09:53.461 --> 09:56.259
And who knows,
maybe he'll rise to the occasion.

09:56.331 --> 09:57.696
Do you really believe that?

09:57.766 --> 10:01.099
Do you want support or the truth?
Make up your mind.

10:01.536 --> 10:04.437
No. No. No. This is absolutely
unacceptable, all right?

10:04.506 --> 10:06.565
And I can tell you that Hannah Montana

10:06.641 --> 10:09.439
will never use
your limo company again.

10:09.511 --> 10:12.480
Good day, sir. I said good day!

10:13.081 --> 10:16.414
- Jackson, what happened?
- They don't have a limo.

10:16.484 --> 10:19.920
And they're saying it's my fault
because I didn't make a reservation.

10:19.988 --> 10:21.922
Can you believe that?

10:21.990 --> 10:23.651
I know I do.

10:23.725 --> 10:25.192
You didn't make a reservation?

10:25.260 --> 10:28.127
Miles, the company's called
"Ready When You Are Limos"

10:28.196 --> 10:32.155
not "Ready When You Are Limos
If You Make A Reservation. "

10:32.233 --> 10:35.259
I think it's pretty clear
who's at fault here.

10:35.804 --> 10:37.499
- Horrible.
- Zip it.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.603
- Jackson, what am I gonna do now?
- Look, it's not a problem.

10:41.676 --> 10:44.042
I'll just drive you
to the CD signing in my car.

10:44.112 --> 10:48.378
Just sit in the back, close your eyes,
it'll feel just like a limo.

10:50.685 --> 10:55.645
Again, really sorry about the whole
convertible top thing.

10:59.627 --> 11:01.117
Hi, everybody.

11:02.597 --> 11:05.293
You have a little
something in your teeth.

11:06.468 --> 11:07.867
It's a fly.

11:13.274 --> 11:14.502
Nasty.

11:27.522 --> 11:30.355
Come on, <i>mamacita. </i> No pain, no gain.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.252
Here you are, ladies.

11:33.328 --> 11:37.059
My newest concoction,
the Smokin' Oken Smoothie.

11:37.799 --> 11:39.892
Cool enough for the hottest babes
on the beach.

11:39.968 --> 11:43.734
Excuse me. Coming through.
Knew him when he was a dork.

11:44.405 --> 11:46.669
What's crack-a-lackin', Lilay?

11:47.809 --> 11:49.106
What is wrong with you?

11:49.177 --> 11:51.668
Face it, Lilly. I found my new thang.

11:51.746 --> 11:54.510
And I'm working it.

11:55.884 --> 11:58.751
Well, work your way over
and get me two bottles of water.

11:58.820 --> 12:01.618
Two bizzles of wizzle for the Lizzle.

12:02.757 --> 12:06.056
I'm going to bizzle you
if you don't knock that off.

12:08.997 --> 12:11.397
Don't be a playa hater, skater!

12:12.634 --> 12:14.534
Ha! You mizzled.

12:28.049 --> 12:31.644
<i>Ay, papi. </i>
- Stop whining, Carmen!

12:31.719 --> 12:34.813
Just pop your shoulder
back in and let's rumba.

12:39.961 --> 12:42.555
Come on, Jackson, answer your phone.

12:43.731 --> 12:45.528
I can hear it ringing.

12:46.668 --> 12:48.727
Why can I hear it ringing?

12:49.737 --> 12:51.227
That's why.

12:52.607 --> 12:53.699
Why, hello there.

12:53.775 --> 12:55.072
You've reached Jackson,

12:55.143 --> 12:56.735
Hannah Montana's assisticant.

12:56.811 --> 13:00.178
I can't do any assisticating right now
'cause I forgot my phone.

13:02.984 --> 13:05.817
- Stupid Jackson!
- What'd he do now?

13:05.887 --> 13:08.219
Oh, he picked up
Hannah's dry cleaning.

13:08.289 --> 13:11.850
- What's wrong with that?
- Then he dropped it in the parking lot.

13:11.926 --> 13:14.793
- Horrible!
- Stop saying that.

13:15.730 --> 13:18.631
I have to perform at the American Teen
Music Awards tonight,

13:18.700 --> 13:21.134
and all I can think about is Jackson
getting me there late,

13:21.202 --> 13:22.567
or bringing the wrong wig,
or clogging up

13:22.637 --> 13:26.232
the green room toilet
and blaming it on the Dixie Chicks.

13:26.307 --> 13:28.832
- Why don't you just fire him?
- I know, I have to.

13:28.910 --> 13:31.310
And I will. First thing tomorrow.

13:32.046 --> 13:34.844
- Miley...
- All right, fine. You're right.

13:35.516 --> 13:40.078
As soon as he walks in that door,
I'm gonna say, " Jackson, you are... "

13:41.089 --> 13:44.388
- Carrying a balloon heart bouquet.
- Yeah.

13:44.926 --> 13:48.862
Look, I just wanted to say that I know
I screwed up a few times this week.

13:48.930 --> 13:52.297
And anybody else probably
would've let me go, but you didn't.

13:52.367 --> 13:54.801
And that means a lot to me. So, thanks.

13:54.869 --> 13:57.599
Wow, Jackson, you got me earrings.

13:58.339 --> 14:01.137
- He got me earrings.
- Oh, no. They're beautiful.

14:01.209 --> 14:03.143
I know. It's horrible.

14:04.012 --> 14:05.411
And I don't even care
how many paychecks

14:05.480 --> 14:07.948
it takes me to pay them off, it's worth it.

14:08.016 --> 14:10.849
- Just to know that you believe in me.
- Uh-huh.

14:11.586 --> 14:12.746
I do.

14:13.988 --> 14:15.717
You betcha.

14:15.790 --> 14:17.417
Well, I'm just gonna go
double check on that limo

14:17.492 --> 14:19.153
for tomorrow night's awards show.

14:19.227 --> 14:21.855
- It's tonight.
- Yeah. I'm all over it.

14:23.064 --> 14:25.191
How can I fire him after this?

14:25.266 --> 14:27.666
Too bad you can't give him
some stupid job at the awards show,

14:27.735 --> 14:29.362
so when he screws up,
it doesn't matter.

14:29.437 --> 14:32.372
Oh, come on, Lilly, that's just brilliant!

14:33.341 --> 14:34.774
I know.

14:35.977 --> 14:38.639
<i>Hannah Montana rehearsal. Take one. </i>

14:44.118 --> 14:47.281
<i>We haven't met, and that's okay</i>

14:47.355 --> 14:50.722
<i>'Cause you will be</i>
<i>asking for me one day</i>

14:50.792 --> 14:53.920
<i>Don't want to wait in line</i>

14:53.995 --> 14:56.828
<i>The moment is mine, believe me</i>

14:57.565 --> 15:00.591
<i>Don't close your eyes</i>

15:00.668 --> 15:03.899
<i>'Cause it's a chance worth takin'</i>

15:03.971 --> 15:06.633
<i>And I think that I can shake you</i>

15:06.708 --> 15:08.938
<i>I know where I stand</i>
<i>I know who I am</i>

15:09.010 --> 15:12.571
<i>I would never run away</i>
<i>when life gets bad</i>

15:12.647 --> 15:15.707
<i>It's everything I see</i>
<i>Every part of me</i>

15:15.783 --> 15:19.219
<i>Gonna get what I deserve</i>

15:19.287 --> 15:21.221
<i>I got nerve</i>

15:23.858 --> 15:27.157
<i>Electrified, I'm on a wire</i>

15:27.228 --> 15:30.459
<i>Getting together and we're on fire</i>

15:30.531 --> 15:33.762
<i>What I said you heard</i>

15:33.835 --> 15:36.963
<i>Now I got you spinning</i>

15:37.038 --> 15:40.474
<i>And don't close your mind</i>

15:40.541 --> 15:43.635
<i>The words I use are open</i>

15:43.711 --> 15:46.077
<i>And I think that I can show you... </i>

15:46.147 --> 15:48.411
Okay. That's enough.

15:48.483 --> 15:50.883
- Great rehearsal, Sean.
- You too, Hannah.

15:50.952 --> 15:53.819
Take ten. You deserve it. So do I.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.047
Great job. Come on down.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.559
Hey. So, what else do you
need me to do, boss?

15:59.627 --> 16:00.992
You want me to check
the sound board?

16:01.062 --> 16:02.290
Inspect the trap doors?

16:02.363 --> 16:04.729
Make sure none of those big heavy
lights come crashing down,

16:04.799 --> 16:07.233
- during your number?
- No, no, no.

16:07.301 --> 16:11.499
Get away from the trap doors,
and stay away from the lights, and...

16:11.572 --> 16:15.338
Well, stay away from everything.
Everything.

16:15.409 --> 16:18.537
- So what am I supposed to do?
- I've got a very special job for you.

16:18.613 --> 16:21.081
It's the only thing
I need you to do today.

16:21.149 --> 16:23.913
Nothing else. Just this.

16:24.752 --> 16:28.654
Everything else, once again, stay away.

16:29.957 --> 16:31.982
- Bring it.
- Okay.

16:32.059 --> 16:35.790
I want you to go to every single
member of the crew

16:35.863 --> 16:39.355
and tell them how much
I appreciate their hard work.

16:40.334 --> 16:42.268
That's it? That doesn't seem
like a very important job.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.827
Oh, no, no. Trust me, it's important.

16:44.906 --> 16:48.808
Good will makes for a good set.
Good set makes for a good show.

16:48.876 --> 16:52.334
And a good show
makes for a happy pop star.

16:53.281 --> 16:54.475
Okay.

16:54.549 --> 16:57.347
Oh, and if you finish, go around again!

16:57.919 --> 17:00.820
And again! And again! Spread the love!

17:02.857 --> 17:04.518
You know, sooner or later,

17:04.592 --> 17:06.560
you're gonna have to
face the music and fire him.

17:06.627 --> 17:10.494
No, no, no. Not anymore,
I found an easy fix for this.

17:10.565 --> 17:13.864
I found out a way to utilize Jackson
to the best of his abilities.

17:13.935 --> 17:16.267
By giving him jobs to do
that he can't screw up?

17:16.337 --> 17:17.598
Exactly.

17:20.741 --> 17:23.938
You tell Hannah Montana
I love her, too.

17:24.011 --> 17:25.705
Whatever you say.

17:26.914 --> 17:28.643
Please put me down.

17:34.622 --> 17:36.954
So keep up the good work
and remember,

17:37.024 --> 17:38.048
Hannah loves you.

17:39.193 --> 17:40.421
You got a kink in your neck?

17:40.494 --> 17:42.553
- You want me to fix that for you?
- You can do that?

17:42.630 --> 17:46.657
Yeah, sure. No problem.
Just turn around, relax, and...

17:49.470 --> 17:51.267
I didn't do it!

17:51.339 --> 17:53.102
My back!

17:53.174 --> 17:54.801
- What you do?
- I don't know.

17:54.876 --> 17:57.276
It worked when Scooby
did it to Shaggy!

17:57.345 --> 18:01.179
- That's a cartoon!
- No, I was talking about my cousins.

18:01.249 --> 18:05.242
- Look, just try to walk it off.
- Yeah, I would, if I could walk.

18:05.786 --> 18:07.777
Man, I can't dance like this.

18:07.855 --> 18:09.846
- I gotta go tell Hannah.
- No, no, no!

18:09.924 --> 18:12.757
What you need to do is you need
to find someplace to go lie down.

18:12.827 --> 18:13.885
Out of sight.

18:13.961 --> 18:16.361
- Where no one can find you.
- No. But Hannah said that...

18:16.430 --> 18:18.796
No. Don't worry, I'll tell Hannah
everything she needs to know.

18:18.866 --> 18:20.299
Mmm-mmm.
She should hear it from me.

18:20.368 --> 18:21.494
I mean, you said we're friends right?

18:21.569 --> 18:22.900
- No, she hates you.
- What?

18:22.970 --> 18:24.995
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
the whole appreciation thing?

18:25.072 --> 18:28.530
It was my idea. You should probably
just go. Go on, git.

18:28.709 --> 18:31.109
Put a little ice on that. And heat.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.669
Ice then heat. Stretch.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.482
Hey. Hannah loves you.

18:37.852 --> 18:41.083
Hannah loves you. You're her favorite...

18:41.155 --> 18:42.679
Sweeper guy.

18:45.293 --> 18:47.989
<i>And now performing her new hit,</i>

18:48.062 --> 18:51.327
I Got Nerve, <i>teen pop sensation,</i>

18:51.399 --> 18:53.560
<i>Hannah Montana!</i>

19:00.007 --> 19:03.101
<i>We haven't met, and that's okay</i>

19:03.177 --> 19:06.613
<i>'Cause you will be</i>
<i>asking for me one day</i>

19:06.681 --> 19:09.809
<i>Don't want to wait in line</i>

19:09.884 --> 19:13.285
<i>The moment is mine, believe me</i>

19:13.354 --> 19:16.380
<i>Don't close your eyes</i>

19:16.457 --> 19:19.824
<i>'Cause it's a chance worth takin'</i>

19:19.894 --> 19:22.419
<i>And I think that I can shake you</i>

19:22.496 --> 19:24.862
<i>I know where I stand</i>
<i>I know who I am</i>

19:24.932 --> 19:28.527
<i>I would never run away</i>
<i>when life gets bad</i>

19:28.602 --> 19:31.469
<i>It's everything I see</i>
<i>Every part of me</i>

19:31.539 --> 19:34.997
<i>Gonna get what I deserve</i>

19:35.076 --> 19:36.873
<i>I got nerve</i>

19:36.944 --> 19:38.571
- Get out.
- It's going good.

19:41.015 --> 19:44.382
<i>Electrified, I'm on a wire</i>

19:44.452 --> 19:47.649
<i>Getting together and we're on fire</i>

19:47.722 --> 19:51.021
<i>What I said you heard</i>

19:51.092 --> 19:54.391
<i>Now I got you spinning</i>

19:54.462 --> 19:57.431
<i>Don't close your eyes</i>

19:57.498 --> 20:00.797
<i>The words I use are open</i>

20:00.868 --> 20:03.029
<i>And I think that I can... </i>

20:04.705 --> 20:06.070
Jackson!

20:07.174 --> 20:09.472
- I'm fired, aren't I?
- Ya think?

20:15.116 --> 20:17.141
What's the matter with you, Son?

20:17.218 --> 20:20.051
You didn't even try to miss
the one-legged chicken.

20:20.121 --> 20:22.646
And he's just hopping in one place.

20:23.457 --> 20:26.221
Who cares? I'll probably just mess it up

20:26.293 --> 20:29.194
like I messed up
being Hannah's assisticant.

20:30.064 --> 20:33.056
First of all, "assisticant" ain't a word.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.467
And second, don't be down

20:35.536 --> 20:38.004
just because things didn't work out
with you and your sister.

20:38.072 --> 20:39.937
It doesn't mean
you're gonna mess up everything.

20:40.007 --> 20:43.272
- You did great down at Rico's.
- I know, and I liked it, too.

20:43.344 --> 20:45.744
Well, maybe that's why
you were good at it.

20:45.813 --> 20:49.340
It doesn't matter anymore.
I'll never get that job back.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.851
Daddy, I feel awful.

20:55.923 --> 20:58.221
I opened my big mouth
and got him fired,

20:58.292 --> 21:01.284
then opened it and got him hired,
and then fired again.

21:01.362 --> 21:04.593
Maybe I should just keep
my big mouth shut.

21:04.665 --> 21:06.326
Oh, honey, let's face it.

21:06.400 --> 21:09.301
You'll never be able
to keep that big mouth shut.

21:10.805 --> 21:12.067
I know!

21:12.673 --> 21:16.507
It's okay, bud. Just remember,
next time before you say something,

21:16.577 --> 21:18.169
just think it through.

21:18.245 --> 21:19.735
You're right.

21:20.481 --> 21:23.473
Wait a minute,
I think I know how to fix this.

21:23.951 --> 21:26.784
- Now, slow down, bud.
- Right again.

21:26.854 --> 21:30.153
Let me really think it through
before I open my big mouth this time.

21:30.224 --> 21:32.283
Yep, that'll work! Let's go!

21:32.359 --> 21:34.657
I know how to get Jackson's
job back at Rico's.

21:34.728 --> 21:37.288
- How are you going to do that?
- Easy.

21:37.364 --> 21:40.424
I just gotta make a deal
with the little devil.

21:58.252 --> 22:00.777
Now that's how you dip, ya dip.

22:05.459 --> 22:06.551
Look at that.

22:06.627 --> 22:10.154
No style. No presentation. No flair.

22:11.098 --> 22:13.794
I can't believe I lost my job to him.

22:21.542 --> 22:24.807
That'll be $3, milady.
