00:37.044 --> 00:39.398
I've just won four hundred
and fifty grand playing poker!

00:40.009 --> 00:41.018
Well done!

00:41.239 --> 00:43.680
I saw that one coming, Mickey73!

00:44.261 --> 00:47.014
That's my rent sorted this month!
And I can buy that new...

00:47.459 --> 00:49.004
Oh, no, I've lost it all again...

00:53.152 --> 00:55.007
Philip! Hello, hi.

00:55.774 --> 00:57.306
This is Philip, from sixth.

00:57.932 --> 01:00.150
This is Moss, this is... Roy.

01:00.634 --> 01:02.020
- Hi.
- Hiya.

01:03.315 --> 01:05.513
So, what brings you to my lair?

01:06.724 --> 01:08.602
Not that I'm some sort of animal!

01:10.250 --> 01:11.645
Or... maybe I am...

01:12.896 --> 01:14.570
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear!

01:15.679 --> 01:17.643
I was just...

01:17.878 --> 01:20.906
wondering if you had...

01:21.145 --> 01:22.208
the latest <i>Heat</i> ?

01:23.142 --> 01:24.655
Yes, yes. There it is.

01:24.816 --> 01:26.188
Thanks.

01:27.136 --> 01:29.637
Sorry about this.
I don't suppose, maybe...

01:30.585 --> 01:33.431
you'd like to come to theatre
tomorrow night, maybe, or...

01:33.996 --> 01:35.244
I'd be delighted!

01:38.915 --> 01:40.982
- He means me, Moss.
- He was looking at me.

01:43.257 --> 01:44.279
No, he wasn't.

01:44.421 --> 01:45.576
I think he was!

01:45.825 --> 01:47.555
You're not even in his eye line!

01:47.729 --> 01:50.048
Philip, who were you talking to?
Me or Jen?

01:50.711 --> 01:53.640
- Do you like the theatre?
- Never been!

01:53.811 --> 01:56.834
But I've always liked the idea
of the theatre.

01:57.237 --> 01:58.489
The smell of the grease,

01:58.631 --> 01:59.891
the roar of the paint!

02:00.814 --> 02:03.495
I've often thought
if I hadn't ended up in computers,

02:03.637 --> 02:05.119
I would've gone into the theatre.

02:05.587 --> 02:07.157
But you've never been to see a play?

02:07.343 --> 02:08.649
- No.
- Why not?

02:09.380 --> 02:10.590
Never had the interest.

02:12.302 --> 02:13.802
Are there any famous people in it?

02:14.501 --> 02:16.167
It's a pass for me then, thank you.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.925
- You haven't been invited anyways.
- Wait...

02:20.120 --> 02:21.302
Laura Nightly's in it.

02:22.237 --> 02:23.720
Laura Nightly from The Build?

02:24.423 --> 02:25.835
She's gorgeous!

02:26.170 --> 02:28.429
You know what?
I will come, Philip. Thank you!

02:29.135 --> 02:31.570
There's no invitation!
Show me the invitation...

02:31.764 --> 02:33.853
I guess you guys could come too
if you wanted.

02:34.018 --> 02:36.184
I know people in the show,
tickets won't be a problem.

02:36.326 --> 02:37.605
Great! That's settled then.

02:37.782 --> 02:39.784
Great! I will give you a call

02:39.926 --> 02:41.739
and then give you the details.
How's that?

02:41.881 --> 02:43.575
That is perfect in itself, Philip!

02:43.734 --> 02:45.339
Thanks for coming down, man!

02:45.772 --> 02:46.772
Catch you later!

02:47.634 --> 02:50.404
That could have been a date, there...

02:51.039 --> 02:52.460
Now, it's...

02:53.210 --> 02:54.534
a work outing!

02:56.007 --> 02:57.736
Sorry! I forgot the <i>Heat</i>!

02:58.991 --> 03:00.648
It's... it's...

03:09.722 --> 03:10.722
What?

03:10.940 --> 03:13.269
He actually did want
to borrow the copy of <i>Heat.</i>

03:17.708 --> 03:20.080
- So?
- Well, it's just... you know...

03:21.238 --> 03:23.524
- No, I don't. What?
- I'm just surprised.

03:24.326 --> 03:25.326
Why?

03:25.893 --> 03:29.069
It's just I don't know
many heterosexual men who read <i>Heat.</i>

03:31.467 --> 03:33.729
What? He's gay

03:34.087 --> 03:36.161
just because he reads <i>Heat</i> magazine?

03:37.340 --> 03:40.208
Well, he's either gay
or a woman in her early twenties.

03:42.828 --> 03:45.364
Why else would he ask me out on a date?

03:46.302 --> 03:48.232
Are you sure he meant it
as a date "date"?

03:48.514 --> 03:51.229
Are you sure you're not going along
as his gal pal?

03:52.431 --> 03:54.750
If you're talking about
who I think you're talking about,

03:54.891 --> 03:56.752
then the answer is yes, he is gay.

03:58.181 --> 03:59.383
How do you know?

04:00.036 --> 04:01.729
Everyone knows. And once more,

04:01.871 --> 04:03.707
he's been gay, since Wham.

04:08.524 --> 04:09.882
We were talking about Philip!

04:10.500 --> 04:11.785
He borrowed <i>Heat.</i>

04:12.261 --> 04:13.302
He borrowed <i>Heat</i> ?

04:15.279 --> 04:17.209
And he knows people in the theatre.

04:17.351 --> 04:21.834
That's not a euphemism. He actually
does know people in the theatre.

04:22.434 --> 04:24.605
Anyway, it's a date. I'm sure it is.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.423
Why else would he ask me out?

04:27.156 --> 04:29.168
Well, don't take this the wrong way,
but...

04:29.432 --> 04:31.109
could he have thought you were a man?

04:34.705 --> 04:37.143
- Let's get a taxi.
- It's a ten minute walk.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.733
No. I don't like walking.

04:38.874 --> 04:41.533
Why do you just not come,
then you wouldn't have to walk anywhere?

04:41.674 --> 04:44.182
I won't spoil your romantic evening
with the gay man.

04:44.341 --> 04:45.488
He's not a gay man!

04:45.642 --> 04:46.930
He reads <i>Heat</i>!

04:48.024 --> 04:49.524
Hey, where are you lot off to?

04:49.841 --> 04:51.315
Look! Richmond's still alive!

04:52.921 --> 04:55.047
We're going to the theatre.
Do you wanna come?

04:55.965 --> 04:57.676
No, thanks. And you shouldn't go either.

04:57.817 --> 04:58.629
Why not?

04:59.526 --> 05:01.044
A new wind is blowing!

05:02.615 --> 05:06.797
Last night, I was stood from my slumber
by a crow calling three times.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.759
Well, you know what a crow sounds like.

05:13.936 --> 05:15.445
Passing to my window,

05:15.622 --> 05:17.157
I trod on a piece of Lego.

05:17.492 --> 05:19.010
Oh, it went right in the heel!

05:20.469 --> 05:21.916
Turning on my television set,

05:22.057 --> 05:23.716
I noticed the reception wasn't great.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.534
Not terrible, just not great.

05:26.687 --> 05:27.692
Hear me well!

05:27.834 --> 05:30.122
No good can come of your trip
to the theatre tonight!

05:30.334 --> 05:31.604
No good at all!

05:31.803 --> 05:32.919
And if you ask me...

05:37.481 --> 05:38.774
That's just bloody rude!

05:41.456 --> 05:42.585
Where is my <i>Heat</i> ?

05:51.504 --> 05:52.616
A gay musical,

05:53.022 --> 05:54.292
called "Gay".

05:55.439 --> 05:57.028
That's quite gay...

05:59.168 --> 06:01.303
Gay musical? Aren't all musicals gay?

06:02.124 --> 06:04.453
This must be like the gayest musical
ever made!

06:05.571 --> 06:07.126
It's got some pretty good reviews!

06:13.745 --> 06:16.399
"The story of a young man
trying to find his sexuality

06:16.586 --> 06:18.378
"in the uncaring Thatcher years.

06:18.792 --> 06:22.414
"Warning. Includes scenes
of graphic homo eroticism."

06:24.867 --> 06:26.509
It's set in the 80's!

06:27.753 --> 06:29.461
Graphic homo eroticism?

06:29.804 --> 06:31.121
Are they gonna get them out?

06:31.262 --> 06:33.029
You're not comfortable
with your sexuality?

06:33.170 --> 06:34.668
I'm comfortable with my sexuality.

06:34.810 --> 06:37.511
I don't wanna be slapped in the face
with their sexuality.

06:38.008 --> 06:39.543
Look! There is Philip!

06:39.950 --> 06:41.829
Look! He's leching at that lady!

06:42.093 --> 06:43.187
Thank God for that!

06:43.434 --> 06:45.446
He's just an ordinary ignored man!

06:48.579 --> 06:50.027
Hey! You're already here!

06:51.262 --> 06:53.185
What are we doing, Roy? This isn't us.

06:53.388 --> 06:55.550
It takes place in the past!

06:55.727 --> 06:56.821
Forget the play.

06:56.988 --> 06:58.558
Philip knows the cast!

06:58.735 --> 07:00.697
It's all about the backstage party
afterwards.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.020
Those things are great.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.936
You go to them telling
they were brilliant

07:04.095 --> 07:05.463
and it's free wine all night.

07:05.586 --> 07:07.404
Besides, I really wanna meet
Laura Nightly.

07:08.084 --> 07:09.690
Hey there, guys!

07:11.472 --> 07:13.043
It's great, isn't it?

07:13.537 --> 07:15.389
Great. We should really pick up
our tickets.

07:21.553 --> 07:23.724
I know someone who gets the tickle!

07:25.047 --> 07:26.583
Sorry, I love doing that to him!

07:28.713 --> 07:30.813
This is Jerome.
He does publicity for the show.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.137
He got us our tickets.

07:32.278 --> 07:33.284
Great, thanks.

07:33.443 --> 07:35.331
This is Jen, and Moss and Roy.

07:36.584 --> 07:37.607
How is it going?

07:37.749 --> 07:39.125
My God, you're Irish!

07:39.354 --> 07:40.430
I love Irish people!

07:40.572 --> 07:42.909
They're just mad, aren't they?
They're just mad!

07:43.889 --> 07:45.089
We're all insane, yeah.

07:45.283 --> 07:46.959
You'll love this!

07:47.101 --> 07:48.618
It's great crack!

07:50.965 --> 07:52.360
I'm mad for crack!

07:53.613 --> 07:55.748
Quick everyone!
The show's about to start!

08:06.053 --> 08:08.899
I hope Laura Nightly isn't gonna be
dressed up like toyer or something.

08:09.041 --> 08:11.802
- Who is she in <i>The Build</i> again?
- She plays that heroin addict

08:11.944 --> 08:14.598
- who gets stabbed in the face?
- She is lovely.

08:14.863 --> 08:15.939
Isn't she lovely?

08:16.857 --> 08:17.951
Oh God, here we go.

08:18.264 --> 08:19.681
It might be right.

08:21.498 --> 08:22.792
How bad can it be?

08:29.928 --> 08:31.111
Welcome...

08:31.976 --> 08:34.659
to the United...

08:35.618 --> 08:36.913
Queendom!

08:40.126 --> 08:41.190
Brilliant!

08:41.831 --> 08:43.472
United Queendom!

08:43.683 --> 08:45.713
He can't say that, can he?

09:03.842 --> 09:05.395
Check that asses!

09:08.308 --> 09:10.019
<i>I'm a friend of Dorothy!</i>

09:10.213 --> 09:11.714
<i>I'm a friend of Dorothy!</i>

09:11.986 --> 09:14.422
<i>She is my friend!</i>

09:14.818 --> 09:17.557
This is insanely brilliant!

09:22.709 --> 09:24.553
<i>Hold my hand.</i>

09:26.785 --> 09:27.786
<i>No,</i>

09:28.568 --> 09:30.950
<i>that's not my hand!</i>

09:37.040 --> 09:39.437
<i>I love willies!</i>

09:40.222 --> 09:41.863
Okay, I'm completely satisfied!

09:42.463 --> 09:43.928
Don't leave! It's rude!

09:44.087 --> 09:46.575
It's too gay for me. I thought
I could handle it, but I can't.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.118
There'll be the interval soon.

09:48.260 --> 09:49.603
I'm captivated, Roy.

09:49.972 --> 09:52.407
Calm down.
At least, it can't get any worse.

09:54.456 --> 09:56.520
All right, get them houselights up

09:56.661 --> 09:59.203
and let's have a look at you!

09:59.574 --> 10:01.604
Are you wearing that shirt for a bet?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.827
Audience participation! Go, go!

10:05.159 --> 10:06.711
What have we...

10:07.205 --> 10:08.847
- here!
- Hello!

10:10.365 --> 10:13.612
Tell me! Who wears the trousers
in this relationship?

10:14.513 --> 10:16.488
What? Oh, no.

10:16.629 --> 10:18.173
We're not homosexuals.

10:18.367 --> 10:19.823
We're just very good friends.

10:19.981 --> 10:21.287
So, you never had a look?

10:21.463 --> 10:24.084
- At what?
- His bob!

10:24.605 --> 10:25.840
I've seen it,

10:26.307 --> 10:28.883
when he thrusts it in front of my desk,

10:29.448 --> 10:31.698
or, should he bend over
to pick something up.

10:31.966 --> 10:34.631
I'd love to work in that office...

10:34.851 --> 10:37.303
There's nothing sexual going on.

10:37.445 --> 10:40.374
I do like Roy, but I'm not "curious".

10:43.709 --> 10:45.104
What were you engaging him for?

10:45.686 --> 10:47.935
He was asking me questions,
I couldn't just ignore him.

10:48.090 --> 10:49.277
It's a bit rude, Roy.

10:49.639 --> 10:50.980
So what do you think of it?

10:51.156 --> 10:52.674
I think it's fabulous.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.950
Every value I've ever held
is being questioned,

10:55.091 --> 10:56.415
and I'm loving it.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.123
You don't like it, do you?

10:59.370 --> 11:00.711
The songs are good.

11:01.276 --> 11:02.599
No, they're not!

11:02.952 --> 11:04.205
Hum one of the songs.

11:05.734 --> 11:08.236
Willies, willies! I like willies!

11:08.378 --> 11:09.578
It's "I love willies".

11:09.862 --> 11:12.093
- I love willies!
- Sir, could you keep it down?

11:14.846 --> 11:16.840
- I'm not going back in there!
- Oh yes, you are!

11:16.999 --> 11:18.411
No. I'll wait out here for you,

11:18.587 --> 11:21.426
but there's no way
I'm going anywhere near that thing.

11:21.568 --> 11:24.585
You can't leave me alone in there.
I don't know what the hell is going on!

11:24.726 --> 11:27.677
He's laughing like an idiot
at every single gay reference!

11:27.997 --> 11:30.944
- Why didn't he come off for a drink?
- He doesn't wanna miss anything!

11:33.044 --> 11:34.332
I need to wee wee.

11:34.906 --> 11:36.088
Yeah, me too.

11:40.172 --> 11:42.078
- What's wrong?
- They've got a toilet guy.

11:43.066 --> 11:44.478
I hate toilet guys!

11:45.700 --> 11:47.005
Let's just get over with.

12:20.666 --> 12:21.672
Thank you.

12:25.219 --> 12:26.260
Cheers, dude.

12:29.401 --> 12:31.120
- Did you go?
- No. Did you?

12:31.407 --> 12:32.695
No! How could I?

12:33.136 --> 12:34.707
Block stood looking at us!

12:34.848 --> 12:37.265
What was that?
It's not my fault he works in a toilet!

12:37.407 --> 12:39.083
- How much did you give him?
- A pound.

12:39.330 --> 12:41.783
I just paid a pound
not to go to the toilet.

12:42.497 --> 12:43.854
He's a terrible toilet guy!

12:43.996 --> 12:46.523
He should work where people
don't want to go to the toilet.

12:46.665 --> 12:47.812
I'll use the disabled.

12:47.953 --> 12:49.935
- You can't use the disabled!
- What? Why not?

12:50.164 --> 12:52.034
You're not disabled!
You'll get in trouble!

12:52.846 --> 12:55.175
It's not like a parking space, Moss.

12:55.669 --> 12:57.751
I think. I think it's okay, isn't it?

12:57.892 --> 12:59.816
It's okay.
I'm always using the disabled.

13:00.434 --> 13:01.534
It's illegal!

13:03.278 --> 13:04.316
I don't think so.

13:28.262 --> 13:29.427
You all right in there?

13:31.217 --> 13:32.470
Do you need help?

13:33.670 --> 13:34.670
I'm disabled!

13:34.828 --> 13:36.406
He sounds disoriented.

13:36.935 --> 13:37.800
Move back

13:37.949 --> 13:39.353
- from the door!
- What? No!

13:43.782 --> 13:46.023
- What are you doing?
- Don't panic!

13:51.907 --> 13:53.742
What... What's happening?

13:54.024 --> 13:55.595
Someone's had an accident.

13:56.442 --> 13:58.286
Well, you'd better keep going then.

14:03.747 --> 14:04.911
My God, what happened?

14:05.335 --> 14:06.870
I fell off the toilet.

14:08.502 --> 14:11.008
Well, come on. Let's get you upright.

14:11.818 --> 14:12.824
Thank you.

14:15.692 --> 14:17.174
So, what happened?

14:18.639 --> 14:20.474
- I'm disabled.
- How?

14:21.946 --> 14:22.758
How what?

14:23.305 --> 14:24.611
How are you disabled?

14:26.287 --> 14:27.329
Leg disabled.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.567
Wait, where's your...
Do you have a wheelchair?

14:33.127 --> 14:34.133
Where?

14:36.391 --> 14:37.397
Stolen!

14:38.950 --> 14:40.344
But how did they get in?

14:42.091 --> 14:43.221
I don't know!

14:43.874 --> 14:45.515
All right. It's gonna be okay.

14:46.017 --> 14:47.521
Let's get you out of here. Come on.

14:47.663 --> 14:49.833
Come on. Give me a hand.
There you go.

14:50.028 --> 14:51.925
There you go, there you go, mate.

14:52.075 --> 14:53.817
All right, you're all right.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.493
- Easy, mate.
- Hold him tight that way.

15:12.418 --> 15:13.545
Easy.

15:15.549 --> 15:17.821
All right. Bring him carefully!

15:21.001 --> 15:22.978
Excuse me! This is a staff toilet!

15:26.026 --> 15:27.248
I'm staff!

15:30.232 --> 15:31.656
I really am feeling much better.

15:32.627 --> 15:33.998
You can all go, now.

15:34.891 --> 15:38.177
We're not going anywhere
until we've got you sorted out.

15:40.455 --> 15:42.396
Here's Paul with the wheelchair.

15:42.538 --> 15:44.254
All right. What?

15:45.033 --> 15:48.019
I keep one in the office
for emergencies. Let's get you up!

15:48.218 --> 15:50.791
Nice and carefully now.
That's it, there we go.

15:52.443 --> 15:54.068
There we are, there.

15:56.921 --> 15:57.962
Oh, the police!

15:58.580 --> 15:59.798
Is everything all right?

15:59.957 --> 16:01.074
I'm disabled!

16:03.741 --> 16:06.438
- So, someone stole you...
- My wheelchair.

16:07.649 --> 16:08.832
I'm disabled.

16:09.792 --> 16:12.190
Some lazy bastard just waltzed in there.

16:12.332 --> 16:13.444
Can you describe him?

16:13.586 --> 16:16.201
- It was all over so quick!
- Just tell me just what you can.

16:17.490 --> 16:19.078
Caucasian male...

16:20.331 --> 16:22.239
Bearded.

16:23.758 --> 16:25.354
Red hair...

16:26.293 --> 16:27.523
Glasses.

16:28.680 --> 16:30.051
Possibly disguised, I...

16:30.445 --> 16:31.600
All right, thank you.

16:32.173 --> 16:33.694
Do you need any help getting home?

16:33.840 --> 16:36.173
No, I'm fine, I'm with people.

16:36.652 --> 16:38.037
Here they are, now!

16:39.232 --> 16:40.326
Hey, fellas!

16:42.567 --> 16:45.223
- No, I'll take it from here.
- Nonsense. It's the least I can do.

16:45.408 --> 16:46.397
Okay...

16:51.070 --> 16:52.482
Are you slacking off in there?

16:53.588 --> 16:54.940
Go and get changed!

16:58.546 --> 17:00.482
Excuse me, sir. Can I have a word?

17:00.867 --> 17:03.154
Amazing! Super powerful!

17:03.404 --> 17:04.481
Thanks.

17:04.698 --> 17:05.946
That...

17:06.204 --> 17:07.895
The grit of it!

17:09.143 --> 17:10.327
Five stars!

17:11.577 --> 17:12.892
So what did you think?

17:13.230 --> 17:15.849
- Of the musical?
- Did you not just love it?

17:16.019 --> 17:17.068
Well, no,

17:17.671 --> 17:19.005
- sorry.
- Why not?

17:19.199 --> 17:20.382
I don't know, just...

17:20.605 --> 17:22.670
Maybe, you have to be...

17:23.551 --> 17:24.330
gay.

17:25.104 --> 17:26.404
I loved it!

17:27.163 --> 17:29.687
I guess it's more of a gay thing.

17:31.280 --> 17:32.868
You know, you have to be gay.

17:33.874 --> 17:34.941
A gay man.

17:36.018 --> 17:37.131
A homosexual.

17:37.286 --> 17:40.344
But all I know is I loved
every last second of it.

17:40.563 --> 17:41.689
And I'm not...

17:42.358 --> 17:43.849
usually a fan of musicals.

17:44.249 --> 17:45.696
Do you want to meet the cast?

17:46.173 --> 17:47.037
Come on!

17:47.231 --> 17:49.794
The thing is I have to meet
Moss and Roy.

18:12.658 --> 18:15.534
Listen, I told the cast
about what happened,

18:15.711 --> 18:18.075
and they told me to get you all
to come back and meet them!

18:20.899 --> 18:22.575
Come on everybody! Off the van!

18:29.981 --> 18:32.067
Hey, James!

18:32.314 --> 18:33.906
Wow, Edgar!

18:34.235 --> 18:34.946
Hi!

18:37.114 --> 18:38.114
Brilliant!

18:39.047 --> 18:39.814
Jeremy!

18:40.840 --> 18:43.178
How do you know all these... young...

18:43.865 --> 18:44.888
good looking men?

18:45.065 --> 18:46.617
You know, just from my route.

18:46.842 --> 18:48.222
Hey, Jerome!

18:48.541 --> 18:49.542
Come here, you!

18:49.963 --> 18:51.067
Great show.

18:51.419 --> 18:52.903
Hello, darling!

18:53.112 --> 18:54.630
Listen, I can't talk at the moment.

18:54.806 --> 18:57.045
The disabled are coming for a chat.
Here they are now.

19:14.789 --> 19:16.192
He's had quite an evening.

19:16.404 --> 19:17.745
Someone stole his wheelchair.

19:19.927 --> 19:20.783
Really?

19:22.993 --> 19:24.221
Did you see who it was?

19:25.627 --> 19:26.633
Red bearded man.

19:29.023 --> 19:30.888
How long have you been disabled?

19:32.909 --> 19:34.947
- Ten years.
- Ten years!

19:35.469 --> 19:38.099
And how did it happen,
if that's not a rude question?

19:41.842 --> 19:42.649
Acid.

19:45.241 --> 19:47.335
What are the chances
of that happening?

19:48.311 --> 19:49.636
A hundred to one.

19:51.144 --> 19:53.535
- You're like you could do with a drink.
- Whisky.

19:53.870 --> 19:55.356
Please. Double.

19:55.957 --> 19:57.377
- Excuse me?
- Yes, miss?

20:07.339 --> 20:10.641
Can I have a double whisky, please?

20:10.923 --> 20:11.947
Double whisky.

20:12.194 --> 20:13.508
And a glass of white wine.

20:13.666 --> 20:14.813
A glass of white wine.

20:16.518 --> 20:17.833
You're very welcome, madam.

20:30.830 --> 20:33.299
- Hello, Laura Nightly.
- How are you?

20:34.126 --> 20:35.187
I'm disabled!

20:35.593 --> 20:38.297
It must be so difficult
being gay and disabled.

20:39.771 --> 20:40.954
Very difficult.

20:45.315 --> 20:47.027
Come here, my little soldier.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.787
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

20:52.910 --> 20:55.072
- You're from telly!
- I am.

20:55.766 --> 20:59.524
And you know, a little birdy told me
that you couldn't make the show tonight.

20:59.757 --> 21:01.910
So, I've got you two tickets
for tomorrow.

21:05.037 --> 21:06.040
Brilliant!

21:06.850 --> 21:08.445
- You're doing so well!
- Yeah.

21:08.587 --> 21:10.306
- High five!
- High five!

21:12.467 --> 21:13.760
A couple of photos?

21:16.057 --> 21:17.627
Is he from a newspaper?

21:17.817 --> 21:20.296
- Yes, he's from <i>The Standard</i>.
- Oh, God!

21:22.444 --> 21:23.591
What... What's...

21:24.248 --> 21:25.573
I get it!

21:26.173 --> 21:28.259
Very funny, you Irish!

21:28.849 --> 21:31.573
I'm a bit tired!
Can I have a wheelchair too?

21:32.706 --> 21:33.712
Hilarious!

21:34.746 --> 21:36.427
Me legs don't work!

21:36.762 --> 21:38.597
Help, pal! I need a wheelchair!

21:38.756 --> 21:40.824
Come on, get out! Come on!

21:41.027 --> 21:43.199
Stop buzzing around, all right, Gary?

21:51.671 --> 21:53.878
Well, I guess this is good night.

22:08.811 --> 22:11.179
For God sake, are you gay?
Are you a gay man?

22:11.724 --> 22:12.759
- Are you?
- No!

22:12.901 --> 22:14.354
So brilliant, dude! That's...

22:14.531 --> 22:16.542
'Cause that's all I wanted to know.
I don't mind,

22:16.701 --> 22:18.730
one way or another, you know.
it's just I like...

22:18.889 --> 22:20.548
being clear. I don't want any...

22:21.260 --> 22:22.296
ambiguity.

22:22.455 --> 22:24.434
What on earth made you think I was gay?

22:25.363 --> 22:27.636
Well, you know... I didn't just...

22:27.946 --> 22:29.288
pull it out of the air.

22:29.542 --> 22:32.809
You know, you just brought me
to a gay musical called "Gay",

22:33.321 --> 22:35.106
You've been laughing like mad
at every...

22:35.281 --> 22:37.253
at every gay reference. Your friends,

22:37.938 --> 22:39.704
more of whom are gay,

22:40.004 --> 22:41.875
say hello by tickling you!

22:43.189 --> 22:45.502
In what century are you living in?
Do you think

22:45.661 --> 22:48.325
that a man has to be gay
to like a gay musical?

22:48.517 --> 22:51.153
Can a straight man
not have homosexual friends?

22:51.859 --> 22:54.276
And since when was tickling gay?

22:54.432 --> 22:56.200
I missed that meaning, Jen!

22:57.843 --> 22:59.899
- Come here.
- I'm sorry, I guess

23:00.041 --> 23:02.043
you astray me when you borrowed
that copy of <i>Heat</i>.

23:02.185 --> 23:03.840
Oh God, it's true,

23:04.018 --> 23:05.433
it's true, I'm gay!

23:05.575 --> 23:08.445
I'm a gay man!
I tried to run from it tonight

23:08.587 --> 23:10.666
but I can't, I can't!

23:10.843 --> 23:13.595
Jen, what am I gonna do?

23:15.130 --> 23:17.708
I thought
I could make it work between us,

23:17.911 --> 23:20.322
because you looked a bit like a man!

23:30.323 --> 23:31.431
Taxi!

23:52.658 --> 23:53.914
Hello, there.

23:55.474 --> 23:57.211
I didn't see you on the way out.

23:58.482 --> 24:00.939
All right, lads!
Let's get a sing song coming!

24:01.211 --> 24:03.051
It's a long way back to Manchester!

24:13.464 --> 24:15.318
- 'Night, Steve.
- 'Night, Moss.

24:15.460 --> 24:17.970
- 'Night Melly, you be good!
- Mind if I can't help it.

24:24.773 --> 24:25.937
Ah, the theatre....
