WEBVTT

00:01.035 --> 00:02.570
Scrub in with The Resident.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.605
This is a business.
It's not a charity.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.574
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:06.674 --> 00:08.542
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.642 --> 00:11.912
9-1-1, Lethal Weapon,
and Empire.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.248
We lost Empire,
but we are still here.

00:14.348 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.020
-Previously on The Resident...
-I am not interested

00:20.054 --> 00:22.156
in being in your line

00:22.190 --> 00:23.924
of giants.
I am the first

00:23.957 --> 00:26.194
of my own line. An ancestor.

00:26.227 --> 00:28.362
Not your descendant.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.931
His seizures are getting harder
to control.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.666
-So what do I do now?
-BELL: The VNS

00:32.700 --> 00:35.336
is the best option available
to your son.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.706
It was my responsibility
to look after my sisters.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.609
One night I decided
to take a quick nap,

00:41.642 --> 00:44.845
and when I woke up,
the whole house was on fire.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.047
Dr. Mina Okafor,
will you marry me?

00:47.081 --> 00:49.150
(applause)

00:51.219 --> 00:53.421
OSDER:
I know this is
a scary diagnosis.

00:53.454 --> 00:56.290
Triple-negative breast cancer
is aggressive

00:56.324 --> 00:58.126
and difficult to treat.

00:58.159 --> 01:00.461
It's also more common
in Nigerian women,

01:00.494 --> 01:03.564
and far more often, it's fatal.

01:03.597 --> 01:06.300
Particularly in those who,
like you,

01:06.334 --> 01:09.303
carry the BRCA gene mutation.

01:09.337 --> 01:13.307
But, Adaku, in this case,
we found it early.

01:16.177 --> 01:18.612
After what happened to my mother
and my grandmother,

01:18.646 --> 01:20.481
I knew this might happen to me.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.117
But...

01:23.151 --> 01:26.587
A cure is possible
with aggressive treatment.

01:26.620 --> 01:30.090
At minimum, you'll need a
lumpectomy, chemo and radiation.

01:30.124 --> 01:32.626
But given your family history,

01:32.660 --> 01:35.163
I strongly recommend
a double mastectomy.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.998
Mm. I don't want to do that.

01:38.031 --> 01:39.900
It's the only safe option.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.769
-I won't be maimed.
-We have

01:41.802 --> 01:43.571
great reconstructive surgery
these days.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.440
I'll do surgery
to remove the tumor, chemo,

01:46.474 --> 01:48.509
radiation,
whatever you recommend,

01:48.542 --> 01:50.378
but you're not taking
my breasts.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.484
I'll let you talk it over
with Mina.

01:58.786 --> 02:00.621
MINA:
You will get through this.

02:00.654 --> 02:03.691
We will get through this.

02:03.724 --> 02:06.527
I'm 28.
I might die even younger

02:06.560 --> 02:08.262
than my mother
and my grandmother.

02:08.296 --> 02:09.463
They lived in Nigeria,

02:09.497 --> 02:10.864
had limited access
to health care.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.200
You are an American

02:12.233 --> 02:14.468
and will benefit
from American medicine.

02:14.502 --> 02:15.803
You have a real chance
of beating this

02:15.836 --> 02:16.870
if you are aggressive.

02:16.904 --> 02:17.971
I don't want to talk about that.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.508
-But, Adaku...
-It's my decision, Mina.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.150
I'm going to get you

02:30.184 --> 02:33.621
the best breast cancer surgeon
I know.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.490
A fellow Nigerian
who is experienced

02:36.524 --> 02:38.559
with this form
of aggressive cancer.

02:39.593 --> 02:42.330
Do you mean
who I think you mean?

02:48.536 --> 02:50.538
Thank you.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.540
Of course.

02:52.573 --> 02:54.575
(Adaku sobs)

02:54.608 --> 02:56.577
It's okay.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.027
Come on. Was there a ring?

03:14.061 --> 03:15.929
Did he get on one knee?
Were there witnesses?

03:15.963 --> 03:17.565
Yes, a ring. Yes, one knee.

03:17.598 --> 03:20.668
Smattering of applause
from sentimental onlookers.

03:20.701 --> 03:23.070
But you're not wearing a ring.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.072
I haven't made my decision yet.

03:25.105 --> 03:26.774
You love Micah.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.342
You love Conrad.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.544
-You're not getting married.
-True.

03:30.578 --> 03:33.681
He asked me to move in with him,
and I freaked out.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.249
Hmm. More later.

03:35.283 --> 03:37.251
I have to meet
my friend Adaku's surgeon.

03:37.285 --> 03:38.586
She's arriving any minute
from Nigeria.

03:38.619 --> 03:39.720
All right, see you.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.390
(indistinct conversations)

03:46.460 --> 03:48.362
What are you doing here?

03:48.396 --> 03:51.299
Dr. Josephine Okeke
is coming to Chastain.

03:51.332 --> 03:52.766
Who told you that?

03:52.800 --> 03:55.303
Well, Dr. Bell organized
a welcoming committee,

03:55.336 --> 03:57.237
so I jumped at the chance

03:57.271 --> 03:59.307
to meet
such a legendary surgeon.

03:59.340 --> 04:02.109
I mean, come on, this woman
single-handedly transformed

04:02.142 --> 04:03.877
the health care landscape
in rural Nigeria.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.748
Dr. Okafor, how do you say,
"Welcome to Chastain"

04:07.781 --> 04:10.284
-in Yoruba?
-Dr. Okeke is Ibo.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.552
It's a different language.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.886
And don't do that.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.055
You'll only humiliate yourself.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.657
Thank you.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.592
You know her?

04:18.626 --> 04:21.128
Mina asked her here
to operate on a friend,

04:21.161 --> 04:23.731
-a young breast cancer patient.
-She's here because of you?

04:23.764 --> 04:25.733
Oh, well then you have
to join us for lunch.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.735
I got us a table
at The Providence Grill.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.604
I think that's her.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.814
That is definitely her.

04:40.848 --> 04:43.317
Dr. Okeke, Randolph Bell.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.753
Oh. Lovely to meet you,
Dr. Bell.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.154
CEO here at Chastain.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.622
-I'm so happy to have the ch...
-One moment.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.193
Embrace me!

04:53.226 --> 04:56.930
Lovely to see you, Mina, dear.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.466
Aw...

04:59.667 --> 05:01.935
Hello...

05:01.969 --> 05:03.337
Mother.

05:07.875 --> 05:11.044
What happened to your hair?

05:11.078 --> 05:13.647
Oh...

05:14.648 --> 05:16.049
Good morning.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.486
I'm Dr. Pravesh.
Milo Trainor, right?

05:18.519 --> 05:21.989
-How are you feeling?
-Not good, lot to pain.

05:22.022 --> 05:23.891
-Let me take a look.
-Okay.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.393
When did it start?

05:25.426 --> 05:27.461
Yesterday, while I was working.
(groans)

05:27.495 --> 05:29.530
But it didn't get bad
until this morning.

05:29.563 --> 05:31.131
-What line of work are you in?
-Ethics.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.534
-I'm an ethicist.
-An ethicist?

05:33.567 --> 05:36.537
Sounds like you found a job that
pays worse than my residency.

05:36.570 --> 05:39.407
(chuckles) Well, technically,
I'm unemployed

05:39.440 --> 05:41.409
while I finish my dissertation
on moral relativism.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.711
Looks like you've been
on top of your health.

05:43.744 --> 05:46.814
Only one surgery,
appendectomy five years ago.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.749
Any vomiting?

05:48.782 --> 05:50.918
-Earlier this morning.
-Uh, lift up your shirt for me.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.953
-Yeah.
-Hundley?

05:54.855 --> 05:57.357
Mild hydro in the right kidney.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.393
I'm thinking
you have kidney stones,

05:59.427 --> 06:02.095
-my philosophizing friend.
-Is that bad?

06:02.129 --> 06:04.064
Not typically.
Just painful.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.833
We'll get you on IV fluids
and medication

06:05.866 --> 06:07.601
for the pain and nausea,

06:07.635 --> 06:10.404
and let's hope we can get
these stones to pass soon, okay?

06:14.274 --> 06:16.444
Josephine Okeke is your mother?

06:16.477 --> 06:18.078
Yes, and please keep that
to yourself.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.713
I've got to get her
in and out of here

06:19.747 --> 06:21.181
as fast as humanly possible.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.184
Why? The woman is world-famous.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.386
You call her in to operate
on your friend,

06:26.420 --> 06:29.623
and you don't want anybody
to know you're related?

06:29.657 --> 06:31.058
Your flight was good?

06:31.091 --> 06:35.629
Oh, it was fine,
until Dr. Michaels from the CDC

06:35.663 --> 06:39.066
bribed the flight attendant
to switch seats so he could be

06:39.099 --> 06:40.601
-right next to me.
-(groans)

06:40.634 --> 06:42.636
-Oh, he wouldn't stop talking.
-(laughs)

06:42.670 --> 06:46.474
He wanted to know all about the
hospital I'm building in Gombe--

06:46.507 --> 06:48.241
200 beds--

06:48.275 --> 06:49.977
the biggest in Eastern Nigeria.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.979
Well, I hope you get a chance
to tour

06:52.012 --> 06:54.715
our state-of-the-art cancer wing
while you're here.

06:54.748 --> 06:58.486
Wherever the great Dr. Randolph
Bell leads, I will follow.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.053
(both chuckle)

07:00.087 --> 07:02.122
Please.

07:05.325 --> 07:08.929
So, the great truth-teller lied.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.731
You said you were an ancestor.

07:10.764 --> 07:14.802
But, Mina, you are a descendent
of medical royalty.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.237
My mother is my mother,
and yet she is not.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.272
Excuse me.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.243
GORDON:
So, this is Henry,
only eight years old,

07:23.276 --> 07:26.313
and Henry's epilepsy
interrupted his schoolwork,

07:26.346 --> 07:30.250
his baseball games,
his time with friends.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.587
He suffered from
violent seizures daily,

07:33.621 --> 07:37.290
until we implanted the QuoVadis
vagus nerve stimulator.

07:37.324 --> 07:41.428
And now, Henry's seizures
are nearly nonexistent.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.463
He's back to school,
he's playing baseball,

07:43.497 --> 07:45.032
he's with his friends.

07:45.065 --> 07:48.268
And what was once a pipe dream
is now a reality.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.871
-A cure for epilepsy?
-Can you imagine?

07:50.904 --> 07:53.974
I mean, the potential of this
QuoVadis device is unlimited.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.145
NIC:
All right, hold still
for just a second.

07:59.647 --> 08:00.848
CONRAD:
So, how's baseball going?

08:00.881 --> 08:02.015
HENRY:
I got a triple last week.

08:02.049 --> 08:05.285
(chuckles):
Oh, nice.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.888
So tell me, what's going on?

08:07.921 --> 08:10.357
Nothing.

08:10.390 --> 08:13.060
Mom's being the worst.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.863
-The worst, huh?
-She thinks I'm having
seizures again,

08:15.896 --> 08:17.865
-but I'm not.
-Hey, how'd you get that bruise?

08:17.898 --> 08:21.468
-Slide into third?
-I fell.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.170
At school.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.875
Okay, bud. Let us talk
to your mom for a minute.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.910
Be right back.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.649
ZOEY:
What's going on?

08:35.683 --> 08:37.651
I thought the VNS would
get rid of his seizures.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.820
The best-case scenario
was always a reduction

08:39.853 --> 08:41.589
in the number and severity.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.992
So far,
no VNS device is a cure-all.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.827
NIC:
And considering
how things started

08:46.860 --> 08:49.196
for Henry,
it's worked really well.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.398
I'll bring in Henry's
pediatric neurologist,

08:51.431 --> 08:53.233
Dr. Eckart,
and we'll run some tests.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.570
Uh, this sounds like it might
take a bit to figure out.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.371
I-I've got to go to work.
I'll check in later.

08:58.405 --> 09:01.041
-Go. Thank you.
-Yeah.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.946
We just started dating.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.415
Henry's condition
is a lot to take in.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.952
Look, Zoey...
I'm sorry, but we have to ask.

09:11.985 --> 09:14.955
There's a... there's a nasty
bruise on Henry's arm.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.523
There's no way
that Doug would ever...

09:16.556 --> 09:18.892
No. Absolutely not.

09:18.926 --> 09:22.095
Okay. Well, let's see
how things go with the EEG.

09:22.129 --> 09:24.131
We'll figure this out.

09:30.838 --> 09:34.141
So this is where you chose
to do your residency?

09:34.174 --> 09:36.810
I was just at Oxford,
and it's like suites

09:36.844 --> 09:41.749
at the Hotel Cardova in Positano
in comparison to this dump.

09:41.782 --> 09:44.652
Thank you for coming
on short notice, Mother.

09:44.685 --> 09:46.086
Oh.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.289
After four years
of cutting me dead,

09:49.322 --> 09:52.059
I'm still shocked you called me.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.328
I want the best for Adaku.
That is you.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.631
Well, I'm touched you admit it.

09:57.665 --> 09:59.867
I never denied it.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.139
OKEKE:
A decent-sized mass.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.809
-Any sign of distant spread?
-No.

10:08.842 --> 10:12.112
But Adaku has multifocal DCIS
in the other breast

10:12.145 --> 10:13.747
and the BRCA1 gene mutation.

10:13.781 --> 10:17.017
This took her mother at 39
and her grandmother at 38.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.152
Did you set up
a gyn-onc consult?

10:19.186 --> 10:21.354
Yes, but one step at a time.

10:21.388 --> 10:23.590
We have to deal
with the breasts first.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.693
Considering all the factors,

10:25.726 --> 10:28.929
she will need
a double mastectomy.

10:28.962 --> 10:31.531
I agree, and so does
her oncologist,

10:31.564 --> 10:34.668
but so far, she's refusing.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.269
Well, have you talked
to her about it?

10:36.303 --> 10:37.671
Of course.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.307
Ah, that's the problem.

10:40.340 --> 10:44.878
Let me guess--
you gave her every statistic,

10:44.912 --> 10:46.714
but without diplomacy,

10:46.747 --> 10:48.749
tact and compassion.

10:50.217 --> 10:53.220
Patients need warmth, Mina.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.489
But it's all right.

10:56.523 --> 10:59.359
I'm here.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.134
(groaning)

11:07.167 --> 11:08.802
HUNDLEY:
BP 88/45.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.203
-Heart rate, 120.
-How's the pain?

11:10.237 --> 11:11.471
Worse. Lots worse.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.973
You said kidney stones.
What did his UA show?

11:13.006 --> 11:15.508
Only a few RBCs
but otherwise clean.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.044
(yelps)

11:18.078 --> 11:19.612
DEVON:
Okay, okay.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.815
Abdominal pain is new.

11:21.849 --> 11:23.150
He only had flank pain before.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.052
He's septic. Five dollars
says it's an appendicitis.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.320
Pay up. He had an appendectomy
five years ago.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.157
-He needs a CT, now.
-He's already critical.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.860
I'll give them a call, get him
to the front of the line.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.730
(device beeping)

11:36.764 --> 11:38.932
VNS is functional.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.202
And...

11:42.235 --> 11:44.337
Henry's EEG looks good.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.839
No seizures
since he's been here.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.074
Oh, thank God.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.009
But how do you explain
the falls?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.878
I trip, that's all.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.712
They weren't seizures, I swear.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.681
-(phone vibrating)
-Let's keep him here
for the day for observation,

11:54.714 --> 11:56.116
just to be safe.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.724
Everything okay?

12:05.759 --> 12:07.194
My boss.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.930
Big presentation today.
Promised I'd be there.

12:09.963 --> 12:13.033
I am pretty sure he'll fire me
if I miss another day,

12:13.066 --> 12:14.701
but I can't leave Henry.

12:14.734 --> 12:17.437
The hospital can provide
a sitter until you come back.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.273
Yeah, and Conrad and I can check
on him as much as possible.

12:20.307 --> 12:21.809
I'll be fine, Mom.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.710
CONRAD:
Go, Zoey.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.445
We got this.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.350
Okay.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.334
What the...?

12:47.367 --> 12:49.102
Hope you haven't
spent that fiver,

12:49.136 --> 12:51.471
because that would be
an appendix right there.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.073
That's impossible.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.075
Dr. Kays did an appendectomy
on Milo five years ago.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.643
Well, someone screwed up.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.446
Because that's
an inflamed appendix.

12:59.479 --> 13:02.082
(exhales) We need
to get him to surgery now

13:02.115 --> 13:04.451
-before it ruptures.
-Good idea.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.855
Thank you so much
for coming to see me.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.423
Oh, I was so happy
to get my daughter's call.

13:10.457 --> 13:13.093
It's the first time
she's ever asked for my help,

13:13.126 --> 13:15.695
which means you must be
very special.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.330
Now, as you know,

13:17.364 --> 13:21.134
Mina is, um,
a woman of few words.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.170
And I'm sure
you love her for it,

13:23.203 --> 13:25.472
but I am just the opposite.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.841
I love to have a good chat.

13:27.875 --> 13:31.511
And unlike most surgeons,
I talk to my patients.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.816
I want to know

13:36.850 --> 13:39.686
what is uppermost in your mind.

13:40.687 --> 13:42.189
I'm terrified.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.790
Of course you are.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.458
It's only natural.

13:45.492 --> 13:48.328
I watched this happen to my mom.

13:48.361 --> 13:51.464
I saw how she suffered
and I saw how she died.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.701
A tragedy, for her and for you.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.737
Every daughter needs her mother,

13:57.770 --> 14:01.875
and you were robbed
of her love and her support.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.743
A crushing loss.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.415
Daughters need their mother,
don't they, Mina?

14:10.517 --> 14:12.652
I want to have a child soon.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.221
And I want to nurse my baby.

14:14.254 --> 14:17.390
And then, if necessary,
I'll have the double mastectomy.

14:17.424 --> 14:20.393
And I wish your mother were here

14:20.427 --> 14:23.163
to see this baby of yours,
don't you?

14:23.196 --> 14:24.797
Yes.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.601
I miss her so much.

14:28.635 --> 14:32.272
The last time I saw her
was right after her surgery.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.342
And the scars were awful
and she died a week later.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.377
The doctor maimed her
and it did no good.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.046
Because it was too late, Adaku.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.713
But I'm younger. I have time.

14:40.747 --> 14:44.417
And what good
would it do your future baby

14:44.451 --> 14:47.520
for you to leave her early

14:47.554 --> 14:49.789
the way your mom left you?

14:49.822 --> 14:51.424
Hmm?

14:55.762 --> 14:59.532
You saw a part of your mother's
womanhood destroyed

14:59.566 --> 15:02.569
and still she lost her life.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.472
But that doesn't
have to be your story.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.109
Adaku.

15:11.144 --> 15:13.780
We have to act immediately,

15:13.813 --> 15:18.218
and you have to trust me
to give you

15:18.251 --> 15:19.786
the best chance to live,

15:19.819 --> 15:23.256
for you and your future family.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.028
Hmm?

15:31.764 --> 15:34.267
Schedule the surgery, Mina.

15:37.137 --> 15:40.273
I have a lot to teach you
if you'd ever listen.

15:40.307 --> 15:43.010
-I listened, and...
-You're welcome.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.820
Hey, buddy.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.455
Taking a break
from all those tests?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.958
Dr. Eckart said I could
for a little while.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.161
-I'm sick of being
in the hospital.
-I know.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.130
I can sit with Henry
for a little while.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.531
Thanks.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.101
(sighs)

16:08.135 --> 16:09.869
Purple, that's my favorite.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.605
-Mine too.
-Yeah? (chuckles)

16:12.639 --> 16:14.541
Well, you look like
you're feeling a bit better.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.012
How are things at home, Henry?

16:22.349 --> 16:25.185
Are you and Conrad
gonna get married?

16:26.219 --> 16:28.821
Uh... (chuckles)

16:28.855 --> 16:30.123
That's a good question.

16:30.157 --> 16:32.392
-I don't know.
-Don't you love him?

16:32.425 --> 16:36.229
Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Very much.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.398
-But...
-I thought maybe...

16:38.431 --> 16:41.734
he'd marry my mom.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.571
But... now she has Doug.

16:44.604 --> 16:47.274
I wish Conrad was my dad.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.014
Buddy, that's another bruise
since this morning.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.817
How did you get that?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.252
I don't know.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.554
It's okay. Don't worry.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.423
We'll figure it out.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.430
(phone vibrating)

17:17.370 --> 17:18.871
GORDON (on phone):
I heard there was an issue

17:18.905 --> 17:20.773
with our VNS poster child,
Henry Barnett.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.542
Has he been admitted?

17:22.575 --> 17:23.943
BELL:
Yeah. Uh...

17:23.976 --> 17:25.878
he was brought in
with a possible seizure,

17:25.912 --> 17:28.181
a minor seizure.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.882
We are getting ready
to take our stock public.

17:29.916 --> 17:32.119
-I'm well aware.
-The VNS is being

17:32.152 --> 17:34.354
featured at the
Innovation Summit tomorrow.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.289
If any issue comes up,
I want it handled.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.625
Quietly.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.960
Obviously, our first concern

17:40.993 --> 17:43.196
is the child's welfare.

17:43.230 --> 17:48.067
B-But we will be
as discrete as possible.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.242
(monitor beeping)

17:59.646 --> 18:01.013
You paged me?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.383
My patient is still hypotensive.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.951
Are you sure that you got out

18:04.984 --> 18:06.386
all the infection
during surgery?

18:06.419 --> 18:07.654
Yeah, well, he perforated,

18:07.687 --> 18:09.456
so it took me
an extra 20 minutes to lavage

18:09.489 --> 18:11.291
his abdominal cavity,
all because

18:11.324 --> 18:12.659
you caught this so late.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.394
A ruptured appendix, Pravesh.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.895
It's kindergarten stuff,
the janitor could've caught it.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.464
-Yeah, but his record said...
-Do not

18:17.497 --> 18:20.032
give me your excuses.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.035
The patient could've died.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.279
OKEKE:
In Nigeria, it is not uncommon

18:32.312 --> 18:34.314
that the first time
a woman is seen in a clinic,

18:34.347 --> 18:37.484
she already has
stage IV breast cancer.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.852
I have seen tumors
the size of tangerines.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.854
And the reason they come so late

18:41.888 --> 18:44.324
is because of social pressures?
Lack of education?

18:44.357 --> 18:46.759
Oh, no, no. No access
to health care or screenings.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.128
Not until I started my clinic.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.264
I mean, it was a battle
from the beginning,

18:51.298 --> 18:53.166
but change is never easy.

18:53.200 --> 18:57.036
You push, you nudge
and if necessary, you fight.

18:57.069 --> 18:58.605
-(laughs)
-BELL:
You're such an inspiration.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.107
We need more doctors
like you here at Chastain.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.543
Oh, no, my dear.
I have no interest.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.977
I'll stay in Nigeria, my home.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.980
We have too few doctors there

19:08.014 --> 19:11.351
and that is why it's such
a shame that Mina came here.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.353
Well, we're awfully glad
that she did.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.887
BELL:
Indeed we are.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.323
Dr. Okafor,
have you ever thought about

19:16.356 --> 19:18.358
going back to Nigeria to help
your mother with her work?

19:18.391 --> 19:22.128
-No.
-OKEKE: You see...

19:22.161 --> 19:24.564
having a successful parent
is difficult for children.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.467
They have to chart
their own course.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.570
That is not the issue.

19:30.603 --> 19:34.006
I believe I know
what Mina is referring to.

19:34.040 --> 19:37.176
You see, my daughter
was a med student in Lagos

19:37.210 --> 19:39.646
and she was a good student.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.981
She showed promise.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.483
And then something happened

19:43.516 --> 19:45.184
that caused her
to leave her family,

19:45.218 --> 19:46.753
her home, her country,

19:46.786 --> 19:48.488
and never come back.

19:48.521 --> 19:52.259
It was a family matter
seldom spoken about

19:52.292 --> 19:54.461
that caused us all
the greatest pain.

19:55.595 --> 19:59.232
(clears throat)
So... the clinics in Gombe--

19:59.266 --> 20:01.268
-how many...
-I take it you have not

20:01.301 --> 20:03.370
discussed this
with your colleagues.

20:03.403 --> 20:04.837
Mother.

20:04.871 --> 20:07.440
This lunch is about you, not me.

20:07.474 --> 20:10.743
I think you'll be kind enough
to respect my privacy.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.047
Excuse me.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.784
This has been lovely
but I have to get back.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.719
-No, Mina.
-MINA: No.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.861
Thank you so much, Dr. Bell.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.798
Few things are as rewarding

20:31.831 --> 20:33.232
as spending time
with colleagues.

20:33.266 --> 20:34.867
My pleasure, Dr. Okeke.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.803
Oh, please call me Josephine.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.640
Thank you again.

20:55.655 --> 20:58.491
I thought you had to get back.

20:58.525 --> 21:01.160
Obviously, we need
to talk in private.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.601
-How dare you.
-How dare I?

21:08.635 --> 21:11.904
You walk out of a luncheon
to honor me and embarrass me

21:11.938 --> 21:14.341
in front of your colleagues,

21:14.374 --> 21:16.142
but you embarrassed
yourself more

21:16.175 --> 21:17.844
because they respect me.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.813
You are worthy of respect,
as a doctor.

21:20.847 --> 21:24.183
Oh, but I'm not worthy
of respect as a mother?

21:24.216 --> 21:27.019
Oh, I know what's
behind this attitude.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.322
I know it all too well.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.958
You blame me.

21:31.991 --> 21:35.595
You blame me for the fire.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.498
I blame myself, and our problems
long predate that tragedy.

21:38.531 --> 21:39.966
Oh, I know.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.635
I work too long.
I work too late.

21:42.669 --> 21:45.372
I should've been home.
I am a bad mother.

21:45.405 --> 21:48.708
That is why your sisters died.
That is what you think.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.177
Do not presume to know my mind.

21:53.713 --> 21:58.317
We can find common ground
in the OR.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.853
There is no reason to bring
our personal lives and the past

22:00.887 --> 22:03.490
-into my workplace.
-Oh, please.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.124
If there is any chance of this

22:05.157 --> 22:07.360
coming up again,
our relationship,

22:07.394 --> 22:10.797
both professional
and personal, is over.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.065
Is that clear?

22:19.739 --> 22:21.774
Your sisters adored me.

22:23.776 --> 22:28.715
They adored me.
We were inseparable, but you...

22:28.748 --> 22:31.584
you never liked me.

22:33.285 --> 22:34.954
Never.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.539
He's still hypotensive.

22:52.572 --> 22:55.341
IVC looks good.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.843
Increase his norepinephrine.

22:56.876 --> 22:59.111
Let's hope he responds.

23:02.415 --> 23:04.751
I need his full history
to figure out what's going on,

23:04.784 --> 23:06.385
and I don't trust that chart.

23:06.419 --> 23:08.120
Should we call his
emergency contact?

23:08.154 --> 23:10.389
See what his... brother

23:10.423 --> 23:13.760
-could tell us?
-Please.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.595
Brent Trainor.
There's the number.

23:20.567 --> 23:22.569
(phone ringing nearby)

23:32.144 --> 23:33.345
Hello?

23:35.414 --> 23:37.116
We called the
patient's cell phone?

23:37.149 --> 23:40.386
Or he has his brother's phone.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.589
Who does that?

23:42.622 --> 23:44.123
Wait, you said his name
was Brent, right?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.592
Yeah.

23:47.093 --> 23:48.495
Hold on, here.

24:12.384 --> 24:15.588
Mina and I have never been
in the OR together.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.624
Strange, isn't it?

24:17.657 --> 24:20.527
Residents beg to scrub in
with me on a daily basis.

24:20.560 --> 24:22.795
Well, then this must be
a great moment

24:22.829 --> 24:24.463
for both of you then, right?

24:28.901 --> 24:31.203
MINA:
I am praying for the
best outcome for Adaku,

24:31.237 --> 24:34.306
our patient.

24:34.340 --> 24:37.977
OKEKE:
We'll be using electrocautery.

24:38.010 --> 24:39.879
Set up the Bovie, please.

24:39.912 --> 24:41.948
MINA:
I prefer to use
radio frequency instruments

24:41.981 --> 24:44.216
for maximum precision.

24:44.250 --> 24:47.186
OKEKE:
Cautery is what I used
for a crowned princess.

24:47.219 --> 24:48.555
Good enough for royalty,

24:48.588 --> 24:50.723
good enough for your friend.

24:51.724 --> 24:53.359
Bovie.

25:22.755 --> 25:26.058
You have incredible
hand dexterity, Dr. Okeke.

25:26.092 --> 25:28.928
The field is practically
bloodless. (chuckles)

25:28.961 --> 25:31.764
Well, I've been working
on my technique for decades.

25:31.798 --> 25:34.533
It minimizes
post-op complication

25:34.567 --> 25:37.369
and reduces patient
recovery time.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.909
Here we go.
What do you got?

25:42.942 --> 25:46.278
No! No!

25:46.312 --> 25:48.080
-Let's play again.
-Yeah.

25:48.114 --> 25:49.381
All right.

25:51.417 --> 25:53.385
I can tell you're
scared of something,

25:53.419 --> 25:54.621
but I don't know exactly what.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.923
Will you help me understand?

25:58.057 --> 25:59.926
I'm fine.

25:59.959 --> 26:03.596
I think you might've had another
episode since you've been here.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.865
If that's it,

26:05.898 --> 26:08.034
you don't have to be
afraid to tell me.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.069
I'm on your side no matter what.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.304
Don't tell my mom, okay?

26:16.643 --> 26:19.378
She wants what's best for you.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.580
She's on your side, too,
you know that.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.249
Yeah.

26:24.617 --> 26:26.653
It's not that.

26:28.655 --> 26:32.458
My dad left when I got sick
the first time.

26:32.491 --> 26:35.628
-Mm-hmm.
-My mom really likes Doug,

26:35.662 --> 26:38.430
but if I get sick again,

26:38.464 --> 26:40.767
I think he'll
probably leave, too.

26:40.800 --> 26:44.303
She's lonely.
She needs him.

26:46.338 --> 26:47.907
Doug and your mom-- they're new.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.643
Still figuring things out.

26:52.611 --> 26:55.347
It's not your fault
your dad left.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.017
You know that?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.786
I miss him.

26:59.819 --> 27:03.589
But I also know he misses you
and he loves you, too.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.058
Sometimes people just have
a hard time showing it.

27:08.560 --> 27:10.997
Especially dads.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.169
So...

27:17.203 --> 27:21.140
you're falling down, okay?
What happens next?

27:21.173 --> 27:22.541
I don't know.

27:22.574 --> 27:25.945
It just happens all of a sudden,
then I wake up on the floor.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.146
Mm-hmm.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.348
It's not like my other seizures.

27:29.381 --> 27:31.217
Okay, when did it start?

27:31.250 --> 27:34.653
-Last week.
-How many times?

27:34.687 --> 27:36.689
Four, maybe.

27:38.891 --> 27:41.728
CONRAD:
Yes!

27:41.761 --> 27:43.395
Finally get a win over you.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.332
Come on. Come on, come on, come
on, come on, come on, come on.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.701
-No!
-(laughs)

27:54.373 --> 27:56.108
Hmm.

27:59.779 --> 28:01.580
How is Dr. Okeke doing?

28:02.715 --> 28:06.385
Fine surgeon.
Truly gifted.

28:06.418 --> 28:08.520
Problematic human.

28:09.956 --> 28:11.523
I don't know what
you're talking about.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.692
-I found her utterly charming.
-That's because

28:13.726 --> 28:15.327
she flattered you.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.864
Common technique
amongst charming people.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.899
I hate charming people.

28:19.932 --> 28:22.434
Their main goal
is to make you like them.

28:22.468 --> 28:24.436
They're narcissists,
and once you see through them,

28:24.470 --> 28:26.072
the charm disappears,

28:26.105 --> 28:29.241
they cut you and then they
move on to the next conquest.

28:30.309 --> 28:32.444
That was a mouthful.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.913
Is this about what happened
at lunch?

28:33.946 --> 28:38.017
-Partly.
-OKEKE: Retract.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.119
Suction.

28:41.420 --> 28:42.889
Not like that!

28:42.922 --> 28:46.092
Good God, what have they
taught you in America?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.195
What is it? What?

28:49.228 --> 28:52.398
-You'll need the scalpel to...
-When I ask!

28:58.938 --> 29:00.807
I did not expect that.

29:05.778 --> 29:08.314
So I called Milo's
emergency contact

29:08.347 --> 29:10.549
and I finally got his
medical information.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.819
He has rheumatoid arthritis.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.653
That doesn't explain
any of the complications.

29:14.686 --> 29:16.622
Well, we inadvertently
stopped his steroids,

29:16.655 --> 29:18.657
which left his body without
the stress response it needed

29:18.690 --> 29:20.126
to fight the infection.

29:20.159 --> 29:23.395
Why wasn't rheumatoid arthritis
noted in his medical records?

29:23.429 --> 29:25.431
Well, let's ask Milo.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.765
Okay.

29:28.534 --> 29:29.902
Milo Trainor?

29:29.936 --> 29:33.405
-Dr. Devon Pravesh.
-Nice to meet you.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.007
Thank you so much
for coming down.

29:35.041 --> 29:36.575
We're so glad that we found you.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.510
Dr. Feldman,
this is our patient's

29:38.544 --> 29:42.281
identical twin brother,
the real Milo.

29:42.314 --> 29:45.451
We've been looking at his
records all day because Brent

29:45.484 --> 29:49.121
told us that he was him.

29:56.863 --> 29:58.030
Brent?

29:58.064 --> 30:00.933
Hey, Brent. You okay?

30:00.967 --> 30:04.837
You stole my insurance card,
man. Not cool.

30:04.871 --> 30:06.672
I always wanted a twin.

30:06.705 --> 30:09.942
Oof, two Irvings?
Terrifying idea.

30:09.976 --> 30:12.845
My mom would be happy.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.947
I'm sorry.
Brent has so much

30:14.981 --> 30:17.449
student debt
and no health insurance.

30:17.483 --> 30:19.718
I'm sure it seemed like
a good idea at the time.

30:19.751 --> 30:22.788
You almost died,
my philosophical friend.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.891
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive:

30:24.924 --> 30:27.093
don't lie to your doctor.

30:36.168 --> 30:38.004
ADAKU:
Hey, girl.

30:38.037 --> 30:39.338
Hey.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.841
The surgery went well.

30:42.875 --> 30:45.177
The reconstructive surgeon
and then

30:45.211 --> 30:47.513
Dr. Osder will be in tomorrow
to talk about next steps.

30:51.683 --> 30:52.952
Oh...

30:56.688 --> 30:59.391
I feel like less of a woman.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.728
You're a warrior, Adaku.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.032
And from now on,

31:06.065 --> 31:08.534
you have the scars of a warrior.

31:12.771 --> 31:14.206
Thank you.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.042
And thank you for
bringing your mother here.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.377
She was wonderful.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.579
She did an excellent job.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.182
I can attest to that.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.617
Her skills will make
your recovery far easier

31:25.651 --> 31:27.086
and the outcome better.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.322
You're awake.

31:31.623 --> 31:33.425
Oh, Mina,

31:33.459 --> 31:37.529
why didn't you page me?

31:37.563 --> 31:40.799
I am so grateful that you came
all this way to help me.

31:40.832 --> 31:43.635
Shh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:44.937 --> 31:48.640
Oh... don't mention it.

31:49.942 --> 31:53.879
(fading):
It was my pleasure,

31:53.912 --> 31:56.748
and you did great.

31:59.785 --> 32:02.388
You realize what Brent did
is insurance fraud.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.156
If you don't report it,
you could lose your license.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.125
-What'll happen to Brent?
-Worst case,

32:06.158 --> 32:07.559
the insurance company
presses charges.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.661
He pays the fines
and a whopper of a bill.

32:09.695 --> 32:11.597
I don't think
he'll get jail time.

32:11.630 --> 32:15.267
But he'll be ruined.
In debt for years to come.

32:15.301 --> 32:17.069
-Yep.
-NADINE: Dr. Pravesh.

32:17.103 --> 32:19.605
You said there was a billing
error with, uh, Milo Trainor?

32:19.638 --> 32:22.508
You called me up here
from billing.

32:22.541 --> 32:25.644
It's your lucky day.
I'm here.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.249
Nadine, do you ever
believe sometimes,

32:30.282 --> 32:31.683
especially when someone
is starting out,

32:31.717 --> 32:35.121
they shouldn't be saddled
with enormous debt?

32:35.154 --> 32:37.289
Hmm. Above my pay grade.

32:37.323 --> 32:39.291
But everyone deserves a break
sometimes, right?

32:39.325 --> 32:41.193
-Can we agree to that?
-If I believed that,

32:41.227 --> 32:44.196
I'd be sipping a caramel latte
outside on a bench right now.

32:44.230 --> 32:47.599
Well, then,
here is five dollars.

32:47.633 --> 32:50.202
Go get yourself
that caramel latte. (chuckles)

32:50.236 --> 32:52.838
Well, what about
the billing error?

32:54.573 --> 32:57.376
It turns out
it was a false alarm.

32:57.409 --> 32:58.944
A glitch in the medical
record system.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.512
I can fix it myself.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.648
Sorry you came all the way here.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.250
Enjoy that coffee.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.992
BELL:
We are so grateful
for your visit.

33:14.026 --> 33:16.295
I wish I had more time
to get to know you.

33:16.328 --> 33:19.131
I-I also... I want you to know
how much we admire

33:19.165 --> 33:21.467
and treasure your daughter.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.535
She inherited all your skill.

33:23.569 --> 33:27.406
She's a rising star who will
one day outshine us all.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.776
Speak for yourself, Dr. Bell.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.329
(sighs)

33:50.362 --> 33:52.364
Hiding out?

33:54.700 --> 33:56.535
From whom?

33:58.270 --> 33:59.971
Everybody.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.542
I told you I was adopted, right?

34:04.943 --> 34:07.113
I never met my birth parents.

34:07.146 --> 34:09.348
And if I did,

34:09.381 --> 34:12.151
it probably wouldn't be pretty.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.256
Every time I see her...

34:19.291 --> 34:21.927
I think it's gonna be different.

34:23.929 --> 34:27.199
My dad died years ago, so...

34:27.233 --> 34:30.369
when I lost my sisters...

34:30.402 --> 34:33.805
I lost the only family
I had left.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.313
My mother...

34:41.347 --> 34:44.283
is not my mother.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.487
Not really.

34:53.659 --> 34:56.862
So you came here, you built
your own family at Chastain.

34:59.598 --> 35:02.468
Look, we will
always appreciate you.

35:03.502 --> 35:05.871
Always.

35:23.021 --> 35:26.325
-You have an update for me?
-The good news is I haven't
been able to detect

35:26.358 --> 35:28.126
-any seizure activity.
-So the VNS is working.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.795
-It seems so. The bad news is
-Good.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.096
we still don't know
what's causing

35:31.129 --> 35:32.364
these reported drop attacks.

35:32.398 --> 35:34.032
Even though the tests haven't
revealed any abnormal activity,

35:34.065 --> 35:35.834
I'd still like
to keep him here overnight.

35:35.867 --> 35:37.836
-We need answers.
-Well, if he's not
having seizures,

35:37.869 --> 35:39.505
there's no medical reason
to keep him in the hospital.

35:39.538 --> 35:41.340
-Thank you.
-Dr. Bell, just a second...

35:41.373 --> 35:43.342
No, I share your concerns, so
stay in touch with the mother,

35:43.375 --> 35:45.277
and we'll bring him back
if we need to.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.879
-Dr. Bell...
-Just set a follow-up
appointment for later,

35:47.913 --> 35:49.915
but discharge him.

35:53.519 --> 35:54.886
Call me if anything comes up,

35:54.920 --> 35:56.888
even if it's the middle
of the night.

35:56.922 --> 36:00.392
-Even if it seems like nothing.
-I will, I promise.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.827
Look at him.

36:01.860 --> 36:04.830
He's so happy to be going home.

36:04.863 --> 36:08.734
Conrad, you keep helping us
over and over,

36:08.767 --> 36:11.136
(fading): and I think maybe
I've been overreacting

36:11.169 --> 36:13.805
to every little thing.

36:13.839 --> 36:15.407
(echoes): But you always
take me seriously.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.582
ZOEY:
What happened?

36:23.615 --> 36:25.083
MAN:
Excuse me.

36:25.116 --> 36:27.919
Henry? Henry?

36:28.954 --> 36:30.322
Lost his pulse.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.490
Call the code team,
I'm starting compressions.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.091
Oh, my God!

36:33.124 --> 36:35.827
Oh, my God, baby.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.028
Baby.

36:38.897 --> 36:40.432
Baby...

36:44.035 --> 36:46.738
(gasps, coughs)

36:49.941 --> 36:52.043
He's back. He's back.

36:52.077 --> 36:54.280
-What happened?
-Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of you.

36:54.313 --> 36:56.248
Hold on, buddy.
I'm gonna put you on the gurney.

36:56.282 --> 36:58.016
What happened?
There was a code?

36:58.049 --> 36:59.918
CONRAD:
His heart stopped.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.354
But it started again.

37:02.388 --> 37:04.490
I'm not sure what's going on.

37:10.462 --> 37:13.231
-Okay, here we go.
-(indistinct chatter)

37:13.265 --> 37:14.766
-Get him in.
-Let's hang some fluids.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.004
Cardiac arrest--
it makes no sense.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.608
This one is gonna help us
keep track of your breathing.

37:24.175 --> 37:28.079
And these guys are gonna
monitor your heart.

37:28.113 --> 37:29.315
(mouthing)

37:29.348 --> 37:30.449
CONRAD:
Ah. You all right?

37:30.482 --> 37:32.418
-HENRY: Yeah.
-All right.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.252
Two more, ready?

37:34.286 --> 37:36.121
Smoke over fire.
One, two, three.

37:36.154 --> 37:37.456
-Good?
-Uh, yeah.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.757
All right.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.159
I heard.
What's going on?

37:41.192 --> 37:42.894
His heart stopped.
Is it the seizures?

37:42.928 --> 37:44.663
We don't think so.
We're still learning things.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.231
I paged cardio and neuro.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.133
-ZOEY: Okay.
-It's okay.

37:48.166 --> 37:50.001
Okay, he's safe now.

37:50.035 --> 37:52.070
(monitor beeping rapidly)

37:52.103 --> 37:53.572
-ZOEY: Henry!
-NIC: Zoey, Zoey... Okay.

37:53.605 --> 37:54.740
Just stay back with us.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.542
-Henry!
-NIC: Zoey...
-He's down again.

37:58.009 --> 37:59.745
He's going directly
into asystole.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.112
CONRAD:
His heart stopped.

38:03.181 --> 38:06.952
(exhales)
Come on. Come on.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.488
Come on.

38:16.328 --> 38:18.330
(coughing, gasping)

38:21.333 --> 38:22.568
HENRY:
Ow.

38:24.503 --> 38:26.872
What in God's name is happening?

38:26.905 --> 38:29.841
It's the VNS.

38:29.875 --> 38:32.511
That controls his seizures.
It has nothing to do with this.

38:32.544 --> 38:34.145
His heart is stopping.

38:34.179 --> 38:35.847
The vagus nerve
also slows heart rate.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.483
The VNS must be
overstimulating it.

38:37.516 --> 38:39.150
The VNS is set
to send impulses every...

38:39.184 --> 38:40.719
CONRAD:
Three minutes.

38:40.752 --> 38:43.021
Every three minutes,
it sends a 30-second pulse.

38:43.054 --> 38:46.692
The VNS is stopping his heart
every time it fires.

38:47.726 --> 38:49.561
So his heart
is gonna stop again?

38:49.595 --> 38:52.130
Yes, if we don't
turn off the VNS.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.665
We can't stop it without the
programming wand or the magnet.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.701
-Do you have it, Zoey?
-Uh, not here.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.469
I-It's at home.

38:57.503 --> 38:59.204
There's a wand in the ER.
Go, now.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.006
Keep up with the compressions,

39:01.039 --> 39:02.541
and Ambu when
he goes down again.

39:05.877 --> 39:09.014
Devon. The programming wand
for the VNS-- where is it?

39:09.047 --> 39:11.049
Supply cabinet.

39:19.925 --> 39:22.761
-It's not here.
-(grunts) Damn it.

39:26.598 --> 39:28.567
Eckart has one.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.770
He left for the day.
Call him and get him back here.

39:31.803 --> 39:34.039
It would be in his office
across the street.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.707
Tell him I'll meet him there!

39:40.111 --> 39:42.748
-(tires screech)
-DRIVER: Hey!

39:50.388 --> 39:52.057
(woman gasps)

39:54.159 --> 39:56.528
Mom...

39:56.562 --> 39:58.196
I don't want to die.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.199
No. No, you're not
gonna die, baby.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.768
-(whimpers)
-No, it's gonna be okay.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.703
Just like the last time.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.105
We've got ten seconds.

40:07.138 --> 40:09.941
-Prepare the Ambu bag.
-ZOEY: You're doing great,

40:09.975 --> 40:13.311
my brave, brave boy.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.345
We have you.

40:18.984 --> 40:20.185
(monitor beeping rapidly)

40:22.020 --> 40:23.254
(short gasp)

40:24.289 --> 40:25.624
BELL:
He's down again.

40:25.657 --> 40:27.793
Starting compressions.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.461
ZOEY:
Save him, please.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.497
You have to save him!

40:42.708 --> 40:45.811
-CONRAD (on phone): I'm here.
-Eckart is six minutes out.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.846
Too long.

40:57.656 --> 41:00.358
Please, God. Please. Please.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.598
We should switch.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.668
-I got it.
-We may be at this a while.

41:12.804 --> 41:14.640
Why isn't Conrad back?

41:14.673 --> 41:16.742
I'm sure he'll be back
any second.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.225
Not Henry, no.

41:34.259 --> 41:35.661
Keep going.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.202
Come on.

41:48.106 --> 41:49.340
NIC:
Hurry.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.911
CONRAD:
I got it, I got it.

41:57.716 --> 42:00.118
(device beeping)

42:05.591 --> 42:07.593
(coughing, panting)

42:10.095 --> 42:11.797
Baby...

42:28.046 --> 42:30.048
(sighs)
At least we did it.

42:49.400 --> 42:51.236
(panting)

42:53.905 --> 42:55.741
You saw what just happened.

42:56.775 --> 43:00.178
Yeah, a QuoVadis device
failed in this child.

43:02.347 --> 43:04.049
It stopped his heart.

43:04.082 --> 43:07.085
-It nearly killed him.
-I was there.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.256
Chastain cannot continue

43:11.289 --> 43:13.825
to be in business
with this company.

44:06.244 --> 44:08.213
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:09.748 --> 44:11.516
You survived your shift
with The Resident.

44:11.616 --> 44:14.085
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:16.855 --> 44:18.656
Welcome to the galaxy.

44:19.858 --> 44:21.827
Should be fun. I'll lead.

44:23.661 --> 44:26.531
* We're breaking waves
Shooting stars *

44:26.631 --> 44:27.899
We're gonna make a run for it.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.167
* Live for glory, not forever *

44:29.267 --> 44:33.604
-Go!
-* Reach out *

44:33.705 --> 44:37.208
* Make this right here
Right now *

44:37.308 --> 44:41.012

44:41.112 --> 44:43.782

-Now!
