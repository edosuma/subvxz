WEBVTT

00:00.367 --> 00:03.046
Look, I've invested
in Twitter, Uber, Instagram.

00:03.117 --> 00:05.382
Why should I invest
in your podcast company?

00:05.445 --> 00:07.479
Well, first of all, it's not
just <i> any</i> podcast company.

00:07.580 --> 00:09.981
It's the Cadillac of podcast companies.

00:10.083 --> 00:12.150
Do people still use "Cadillac"
as a reference?

00:12.214 --> 00:14.210
- Mnh-mnh.
- Sorry. It's, uh... the Maybach,

00:14.308 --> 00:17.837
uh... the Khaleesi,
t-the Leonardo DiCaprio.

00:17.923 --> 00:20.106
Wow. Is your dad always this nervous?

00:20.131 --> 00:22.399
- It's 'cause you're rich.
- Soraya!

00:22.501 --> 00:23.700
I'm sorry, again, about her.

00:23.802 --> 00:25.435
We had a little childcare dilemma.

00:25.537 --> 00:27.237
You know, I think I could
explain the money part better

00:27.339 --> 00:29.139
if I fire up the old pitch deck.

00:29.241 --> 00:30.640
Um, now, uh...

00:30.741 --> 00:31.774
I have a graph here.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.886
- Ow!
- Oh, sorry!

00:32.911 --> 00:34.311
I'm just so sorry.

00:34.413 --> 00:36.113
I just never really fully
got a chance to...

00:36.215 --> 00:37.754
to set all this up.

00:37.833 --> 00:38.965
Uh, so many wires.

00:39.067 --> 00:40.434
This guy. Who's this guy?

00:40.536 --> 00:42.402
Look, Alex, listen,
if I were calling an Uber

00:42.504 --> 00:44.037
and it said it was gonna be here
in two minutes

00:44.139 --> 00:45.372
and that's all the time you had...

00:45.474 --> 00:47.541
who are you and what are you doing?

00:47.643 --> 00:48.583
Go.

00:48.645 --> 00:50.477
<i>One month ago, I decided, at 37,</i>

00:50.579 --> 00:53.146
<i>with a wife and two kids,
now would be a good time</i>

00:53.248 --> 00:55.382
<i>to quit my job
and start my own business.</i>

00:55.484 --> 00:57.217
<i>Who am I and what am I doing?</i>

00:57.319 --> 01:00.587
<i>My name's Alex Schuman,
and I'm ruining my life.</i>

01:05.682 --> 01:07.229
_

01:07.533 --> 01:08.820
- Now, who said that?
- Dad.

01:08.877 --> 01:10.151
- And what did he say?
- Dad!

01:10.214 --> 01:11.580
He said what? I'm not...
I didn't hear you.

01:11.682 --> 01:13.115
- Dad!
- Ben.

01:13.217 --> 01:15.518
Let Daddy finish
his super-important work call.

01:15.620 --> 01:17.119
I just thought
he'd be interested to know

01:17.221 --> 01:19.255
that I met this girl on the Internet.

01:19.357 --> 01:21.090
At least, I <i> think</i> she's a girl.

01:21.192 --> 01:22.291
Her name's Steven,

01:22.393 --> 01:24.326
and she wants to meet
in a van in the woods.

01:24.428 --> 01:25.861
Ha ha. I can hear you.

01:25.963 --> 01:27.363
Look, I got to go.
They want me off the phone.

01:27.465 --> 01:28.831
All right. I'll see you in a bit.

01:28.933 --> 01:30.866
Sorry. I'm just, uh,
working on this story

01:30.968 --> 01:32.935
about this alleged murderer,
Wesley Harman.

01:33.037 --> 01:34.537
But Mommy's right... no more work talk.

01:34.639 --> 01:36.772
This is morning family time.

01:36.874 --> 01:38.941
I'm gonna puke up my breakfast.

01:39.043 --> 01:41.806
All right, what's up? I'm sorry.
You have all my attention. Go.

01:41.893 --> 01:43.993
Do you want to see a new
illusion I've been working on?

01:44.869 --> 01:45.927
Sure.

01:45.994 --> 01:47.760
Awesome. Let me get my hamster.

01:47.862 --> 01:49.295
<i>Our</i> hamster!

01:49.397 --> 01:51.264
How do we feel
about this whole magic thing?

01:51.366 --> 01:52.965
Middle-school kids can be so mean.

01:53.067 --> 01:55.201
All I know is,
David Blaine is pretty hot.

01:55.303 --> 01:56.969
Yeah, but for every David
Blaine, there's a Carrot Top.

01:57.071 --> 01:58.506
- I hate carrots.
- Me too.

01:58.607 --> 01:59.939
All right.

02:00.041 --> 02:02.808
Now... pay very careful attention.

02:02.910 --> 02:05.444
As you can see, Todd is in the box.

02:05.546 --> 02:07.246
Oh. Morning, Todd.

02:07.348 --> 02:09.448
By the way, I'm doing a much
more elaborate version of this

02:09.550 --> 02:10.916
for the school talent show.

02:11.019 --> 02:12.785
In front of the whole school?

02:12.887 --> 02:14.754
Whoa, whoa! What is that hand gesture?

02:14.856 --> 02:16.055
Look in the box.

02:16.157 --> 02:18.391
I think you'll find that Todd's gone.

02:18.493 --> 02:19.959
- No.
- No, sweetie.

02:20.061 --> 02:21.186
- He's still there.
- Todd's right there, man.

02:21.233 --> 02:22.170
- Fail.
- Really?

02:22.217 --> 02:23.363
Yeah.

02:23.364 --> 02:25.298
What the heck, Todd?

02:25.400 --> 02:27.767
- We talked about this.
- I have to get this. Don't be mad at me.

02:27.869 --> 02:29.402
He's arguing with Todd.
I promise, it'll be quick.

02:29.504 --> 02:30.803
- What do you mean, you don't like the trick?
- Hello?

02:30.905 --> 02:32.405
- It's a classic!
- He's in?!

02:32.507 --> 02:33.639
Yes!

02:33.723 --> 02:34.640
Harman's in!

02:34.742 --> 02:35.908
- The murderer?
- Alleged.

02:36.010 --> 02:37.143
I got to go. Love you all!

02:37.245 --> 02:38.911
Love you. Good luck!

02:39.013 --> 02:40.279
<i>For the past 16 years,</i>

02:40.381 --> 02:42.415
<i>I've worked at a radio show
called "Cheer Up!"</i>

02:42.517 --> 02:44.617
<i>It was like NPR on Prozac.</i>

02:46.521 --> 02:47.687
I got the Harman story!

02:47.789 --> 02:49.622
<i>We'd been doing
the same feel-good stories</i>

02:49.724 --> 02:52.191
<i>my whole career,
and lately, I'd been yearning</i>

02:52.293 --> 02:54.260
<i>to do something different...
something that mattered.</i>

02:54.362 --> 02:56.162
<i>And so I walked into that pitch meeting</i>

02:56.264 --> 02:58.264
<i>with what I knew would be
a game-changing story.</i>

02:58.366 --> 03:01.934
And it... it... it's
a portrait <i> and</i> a reprimand,

03:02.036 --> 03:04.837
not just of the justice system...

03:04.939 --> 03:06.972
but of society itself.

03:08.276 --> 03:11.777
<i>But except for my producer,
Deirdre, nobody else liked it.</i>

03:11.879 --> 03:13.446
I appreciate your passion, Alex,

03:13.548 --> 03:15.047
but the show's called "Cheer Up!"

03:15.149 --> 03:17.717
not "I Wanna Hang Myself."

03:23.112 --> 03:25.045
<i>And I don't know why,
but in that moment,</i>

03:25.147 --> 03:26.380
<i>something in me just snapped.</i>

03:26.482 --> 03:27.514
You know what, you know what...

03:27.616 --> 03:29.716
I-I-I-I-I can't do this anymore, okay?

03:29.818 --> 03:31.885
I-I can't do one more feel-good piece

03:31.987 --> 03:34.221
about child-prodigy pianists

03:34.323 --> 03:36.323
or gorillas who know sign language.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.492
How many gorillas know
sign language at this point?

03:38.594 --> 03:41.326
It feels like all, frankly.
All gorillas!

03:41.830 --> 03:43.597
Sorry, Akira.

03:43.699 --> 03:45.766
I-I don't want to cheer people up.

03:45.868 --> 03:48.201
I want to engage their minds
and open their eyes

03:48.303 --> 03:49.903
to what's happening in the world.

03:50.005 --> 03:53.039
And I know I'm not the only one
who feels this way, okay?

03:53.142 --> 03:56.042
I'm gonna go somewhere
where I can tell those stories.

03:56.145 --> 03:57.711
Now, who's coming with me?

04:00.382 --> 04:02.249
- You quit your job?!
- Yes.

04:02.351 --> 04:04.284
But what if I...
and this is one of the reasons

04:04.386 --> 04:06.086
why I wanted to take you
to dinner tonight...

04:06.188 --> 04:08.522
start my own podcast company?

04:11.901 --> 04:12.926
Why are you laughing?

04:13.028 --> 04:14.461
Because you're kidding.

04:14.563 --> 04:16.596
You're not kidding? Oh, God.

04:16.697 --> 04:18.531
Rooni, I've worked my whole life
for other people.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.132
I want to do something
I can be proud of.

04:20.235 --> 04:21.468
I want something that's mine.

04:21.570 --> 04:23.236
- Buy a boat.
- We can't afford a boat.

04:23.338 --> 04:24.438
Buy a kayak.

04:24.540 --> 04:25.939
I <i> would</i> love a kayak.

04:26.041 --> 04:28.608
Alex, you're an amazing
storyteller, but...

04:28.710 --> 04:30.610
please don't take this the wrong way...

04:30.712 --> 04:32.412
you're not good at anything else.

04:32.514 --> 04:35.215
I know. That's why I'm gonna ask
Eddie to be my partner.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.917
Second cousin Eddie?

04:37.019 --> 04:38.618
Does he even know what a podcast is?

04:38.720 --> 04:40.921
I'm not sure.
But Eddie can sell anything.

04:41.023 --> 04:42.923
I really think we'd be a good
yin/yang for each other.

04:43.025 --> 04:45.759
He could yang me. And sometimes,
I need to be yanged.

04:45.861 --> 04:46.860
You do like a good yanging.

04:46.962 --> 04:48.094
But no, babe,

04:48.197 --> 04:50.497
you need someone who knows
something about podcasting.

04:50.599 --> 04:53.133
I know, which is why I'm also
gonna ask...

04:53.235 --> 04:54.434
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.

04:54.536 --> 04:56.069
Deirdre.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.905
Tell me you're not mumbling "Deirdre"!

04:59.007 --> 05:00.574
I've worked with like 50 producers.

05:00.676 --> 05:01.641
She's the best by a mile.

05:01.743 --> 05:02.976
Alex, she's in love with you!

05:03.078 --> 05:04.644
Oh, I don't know about that.

05:04.746 --> 05:06.346
It's more of an unhealthy obsession.

05:06.448 --> 05:08.415
I know what this is really about,

05:08.517 --> 05:11.384
and I want you to know,
I am not gonna touch the 401(K).

05:12.354 --> 05:13.587
It would never occur to me

05:13.689 --> 05:15.956
that you would even <i> think</i> about
touching the 401(K).

05:16.059 --> 05:17.525
Again, not going to.

05:17.626 --> 05:19.226
Rooni, this is my moment.

05:19.328 --> 05:21.294
This industry's about to explode,

05:21.396 --> 05:24.030
and if it does,
it could change the whole world.

05:24.132 --> 05:25.966
Let's be a part of that.

05:26.068 --> 05:28.168
I want to change the world. Don't you?

05:28.270 --> 05:29.936
Damn it.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.105
You know I'm a sucker
for Change the World Alex.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.874
I didn't want to play
the change-the-world card,

05:33.976 --> 05:35.842
but you left me with no other option.

05:35.944 --> 05:37.711
Fine!

05:37.813 --> 05:39.312
Go change the world!

05:39.414 --> 05:40.680
Love you.

05:40.782 --> 05:43.683
<i>So, like Jobs and Zuckerberg before me,</i>

05:43.785 --> 05:45.819
<i>I got my dream team together.</i>

05:45.921 --> 05:48.989
Uh, Deirdre, do you think maybe
you could sit across from me?

05:49.091 --> 05:51.024
I'm so sorry... I didn't realize
we were physically

05:51.126 --> 05:52.459
- Yeah, well...
- next to each other.

05:52.561 --> 05:54.160
Aah!

05:54.263 --> 05:56.496
Yeah, 'cause there's more room over
here, actually, so that's good.

05:57.666 --> 05:59.199
So, what, you hired a groupie?

05:59.301 --> 06:01.301
Stop it. Let me make
the formal introductions.

06:01.403 --> 06:04.004
Deirdre Riordan,
meet my cousin Eddie LaGuzza,

06:04.106 --> 06:05.972
the most in-demand salesman in town.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.041
If he's so in-demand,
why is he in a coffee shop

06:08.143 --> 06:09.309
at 3:00 on a Tuesday?

06:09.411 --> 06:12.379
Because I was just dying
to spend 8 bucks on an espresso.

06:12.481 --> 06:13.914
This friggin' place.

06:14.016 --> 06:15.715
Who the hell is she?

06:15.817 --> 06:17.884
Uh, Ed, did you have a chance
to come up with a business plan?

06:17.986 --> 06:19.886
Yes. I ran some preliminary numbers,

06:19.988 --> 06:22.389
and the good news is,
seems like all we really need

06:22.491 --> 06:24.724
is a solid mic and some chairs.

06:24.826 --> 06:25.892
Now, I have some chairs.

06:25.994 --> 06:27.594
I-I-I'm sorry.

06:27.696 --> 06:30.830
It's clear that you have no idea
what Alex does.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.567
He makes highly produced,
highly edited pieces.

06:33.669 --> 06:36.536
They require equipment and staff
and a travel budget

06:36.638 --> 06:39.105
and just a li'l bit
of Alex's special sauce.

06:39.207 --> 06:40.574
But you don't need to worry about that,

06:40.676 --> 06:42.509
'cause it's <i> my</i> job
to get that out of him.

06:43.612 --> 06:46.102
You say filthy things
without realizing it.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.280
I like you.

06:47.382 --> 06:48.882
I think what Deirdre's
trying to say, Eddie,

06:48.984 --> 06:51.017
is the type of shows I want
to do cost a lot of money.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.285
So, why don't we make a list

06:52.387 --> 06:53.787
of every rich person that we know?

06:53.889 --> 06:55.188
<i>Eddie had nothing.</i>

06:55.290 --> 06:57.600
<i>Deirdre had a particularly
lovely picture of me.</i>

06:57.678 --> 06:58.992
<i>I love the way she handled my nose.</i>

06:59.094 --> 07:00.451
<i>And all I could think of
was a billionaire</i>

07:00.529 --> 07:01.728
<i>I once interviewed.</i>

07:01.830 --> 07:03.530
<i>But for our company
to be taken seriously,</i>

07:03.632 --> 07:05.398
<i>we needed an office
that wasn't a coffee shop.</i>

07:05.500 --> 07:07.300
<i>When my co-founders and I
finally found one</i>

07:07.402 --> 07:09.235
<i>that was cheap enough,
I wanted Rooni to see it</i>

07:09.338 --> 07:10.437
<i>before we signed the lease.</i>

07:10.539 --> 07:12.205
Welcome to the nerd factory.

07:12.307 --> 07:13.707
It's an incubator, babe.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.875
Everyone here has ideas
they're developing.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.108
Those guys are designing a robot

07:18.171 --> 07:20.280
- that rocks a baby to sleep.
- Heads up!

07:21.550 --> 07:22.983
Coming along, fellas.

07:23.085 --> 07:25.151
Those ladies made a jacket
you put on cats

07:25.253 --> 07:27.120
to make them hypoallergenic.

07:27.222 --> 07:30.256
These guys are trying to create
a professional beer pong league.

07:31.360 --> 07:32.826
Hey, they're kind of cute, huh?

07:32.928 --> 07:34.761
Oh, I prefer my men more intellectual,

07:34.863 --> 07:36.896
with larger noses.

07:36.999 --> 07:38.431
So? What do you think?

07:38.533 --> 07:41.534
I think it's amazing, babe.
I'm so proud of you.

07:41.637 --> 07:42.736
Listen, I got to get to court.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.671
- I'll see you tonight, okay?
- I love you.

07:44.773 --> 07:46.773
Al, we got a little problem.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.742
Guy wants three months in advance.

07:48.844 --> 07:51.745
I don't have $10,000...
unless I dip into the 401(K),

07:51.847 --> 07:53.446
which I promised Rooni I wouldn't do.

07:53.548 --> 07:55.348
Yeah,<i> but</i> what if there was a world

07:55.450 --> 07:56.916
where you didn't tell Rooni?

07:57.019 --> 07:59.085
- I tell Rooni everything.
- Yeah, in <i> this</i> world.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.654
Let's go to that other world.

08:00.756 --> 08:02.689
Look, I believe in this company.

08:02.791 --> 08:04.524
That's why I'm putting
everything I have into it.

08:04.626 --> 08:06.526
- You don't have anything.
- Yeah, but it's all in there.

08:07.329 --> 08:10.096
I need an answer, fellas.
I got Pilates at noon.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.333
We're gonna be huge, Al. I know this.

08:16.772 --> 08:17.829
We're in.

08:19.893 --> 08:21.336
<i>A week had gone by,</i>

08:21.386 --> 08:24.471
<i>and I still hadn't told Rooni
I'd dipped into our 401(K).</i>

08:24.550 --> 08:27.652
<i>Fortunately, I was doing a
decent job of hiding my guilt.</i>

08:31.697 --> 08:32.863
Oh. Sorry, guys.

08:32.919 --> 08:35.120
I'm just trying to make sure
it's nice and lean.

08:35.179 --> 08:37.034
Guys, Daddy's a little nervous

08:37.135 --> 08:38.869
because he's interviewing
a murderer tomorrow

08:38.971 --> 08:40.371
for his big investor pitch.

08:40.472 --> 08:42.907
"Alleged," and I am not that nervous.

08:43.009 --> 08:44.375
Is it gonna be on the radio?

08:44.477 --> 08:46.077
TV's better. I need pictures.

08:46.179 --> 08:47.645
Ohh! My own daughter.

08:47.747 --> 08:50.181
You don't need pictures.
Are you kidding me?

08:50.283 --> 08:52.550
Here. I'll tell you what.
Close your eyes for a second.

08:52.652 --> 08:56.520
Now imagine hearing
a really creepy old guy's voice.

08:56.622 --> 08:58.856
"My name is Wesley Harman,

08:58.958 --> 09:00.358
and I didn't do it!"

09:00.460 --> 09:01.392
Didn't do what?

09:01.494 --> 09:03.394
Oh! See, Daddy's got you listening now.

09:03.496 --> 09:05.229
Now we hear a woman's voice.

09:05.331 --> 09:06.931
She says she's Harman's neighbor.

09:07.033 --> 09:08.699
"Something was always off with him."

09:09.902 --> 09:12.203
"Always alone on his family's estate.

09:12.305 --> 09:14.739
And when kids would come
and take his apples,

09:14.841 --> 09:16.006
you know what he would do?

09:16.109 --> 09:17.908
He'd chase them off with a shotgun."

09:18.010 --> 09:20.211
Are you sure this story's
appropriate for children?

09:20.313 --> 09:21.812
Okay, calm down, Grandma.

09:21.914 --> 09:25.249
Then, we hear a
policeman's voice on a CB radio.

09:25.351 --> 09:27.918
"Uh, dispatch, we got two murdered kids

09:28.020 --> 09:29.320
on the Harman property."

09:29.422 --> 09:31.355
Yeah, actually, Al,
where are you going with this?

09:31.457 --> 09:33.491
- I like it.
- Me too. Then...

09:33.593 --> 09:36.260
"We now go to Bob Jenkins,
reporting live at the scene."

09:36.362 --> 09:39.964
"Uh, the children both had
a rare poison in their stomachs

09:40.066 --> 09:42.099
and... apples."

09:43.736 --> 09:44.935
- Hold that for a second.
- Ugh!

09:45.037 --> 09:46.637
So, Harman's arrested
and let out on bail.

09:46.739 --> 09:48.506
Now we're in a science lab...

09:51.911 --> 09:54.645
...where a scientist tells us
about this rare poison.

09:54.747 --> 09:56.147
The one Harman put on the apples?

09:56.249 --> 09:58.449
The one <i> someone</i> put on the apples.

09:58.551 --> 09:59.884
The scientist says...

09:59.986 --> 10:01.485
"It's very hard to make.

10:01.587 --> 10:04.789
Uh, you need seeds from
the Croatian Rhine Poppy...

10:04.891 --> 10:07.258
virtually nonexistent in the U.S."

10:07.360 --> 10:09.264
Now we hear this.
Make this noise with me.

10:13.533 --> 10:16.167
The wind blowing through a field.

10:17.136 --> 10:19.032
A knock on a heavy door.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.369
And a voice we've heard before.

10:21.472 --> 10:23.138
"Can I help you?"

10:23.240 --> 10:25.707
- Who is it?
- Harman's brother, Max.

10:25.809 --> 10:29.377
And the wind we're hearing
is blowing through a giant field

10:29.480 --> 10:35.217
of Croatian Rhine Poppies
right in Max Harman's backyard!

10:35.319 --> 10:36.618
So, Wesley Harman's innocent?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.553
I believe that Max framed Wesley

10:38.655 --> 10:40.355
to cut him out of the family fortune.

10:40.457 --> 10:43.024
And I want to tell his story
to the world...

10:43.126 --> 10:44.559
and lots of other stories, too.

10:44.661 --> 10:47.195
And once in a while, sometimes,

10:47.297 --> 10:49.064
they might even change someone's life.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.298
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

10:50.400 --> 10:51.733
"Whoa," indeed.

10:51.835 --> 10:54.402
See? You don't need pictures, okay?

10:54.505 --> 10:55.737
Okay.

10:55.839 --> 10:57.317
Now, go watch TV while we finish dinner.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.346
You look like you're
very attracted to me right now.

11:04.448 --> 11:06.781
- Little bit.
- Well, all those characters

11:06.884 --> 11:08.149
are gonna try and have sex with you.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.018
Well, we'll just see how that goes.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.977
I hope one of them wins.

11:14.057 --> 11:15.724
Guys, I need you to calm me down.

11:15.826 --> 11:17.025
Harman's skittish.

11:17.127 --> 11:19.160
What if he freaks out
when he sees this place.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.829
Al, he's gonna love this joint.

11:20.931 --> 11:22.898
This is a completely normal workplace.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.232
- Ohh!
- Heads up!

11:24.334 --> 11:26.768
Dee! Now is no time for resting.

11:26.870 --> 11:28.236
Harman could be here any second.

11:28.338 --> 11:29.404
I think he's here.

11:30.407 --> 11:31.640
Mr. Harman!

11:31.742 --> 11:33.508
Hi. I'm Alex Schuman.

11:33.610 --> 11:35.076
It's so nice to finally meet you.

11:35.178 --> 11:36.678
I thought we were meeting
in your office.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.280
This looks like an Urban Outfitters.

11:38.382 --> 11:40.682
Oh, no, no, this place is great.
I promise you.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.551
And if there's anything I can do
to relax you...

11:42.653 --> 11:44.019
- Is that a cat?!
- Oh.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.754
- I'm quite allergic!
- Okay.

11:45.856 --> 11:48.723
Well, now, sir, you are in luck.

11:48.825 --> 11:51.426
The Sneeze Jacket uses
revolutionary technology

11:51.528 --> 11:55.263
that makes felines 100% hypoallergenic.

11:55.365 --> 11:56.765
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:56.867 --> 11:59.134
I love cats, but I haven't been able

11:59.236 --> 12:01.202
to touch one since I was a little boy.

12:01.305 --> 12:02.804
Come with me!

12:02.906 --> 12:05.307
People like you are the reason

12:05.409 --> 12:07.642
I've dedicated my life to this start-up.

12:07.744 --> 12:08.877
- Here. Have a seat.
- Okay.

12:08.979 --> 12:11.713
And meet Mr. Tender-Puss.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.214
Oh!

12:13.317 --> 12:15.917
Mr. Tender-Puss. Hi.

12:16.019 --> 12:17.285
This is amazing, dude.

12:17.387 --> 12:19.087
That cat is totally calming him down.

12:19.189 --> 12:21.957
This is it, cuz.
Your dream's about to come true.

12:22.059 --> 12:23.925
Should we hug?
I feel like maybe we should hug.

12:24.027 --> 12:26.461
Okay, quick one... with back taps.

12:30.367 --> 12:31.266
Oh, my God!

12:31.368 --> 12:32.601
That's not good.

12:32.703 --> 12:34.269
What a wonderful jacket!

12:34.371 --> 12:37.005
It looks so handsome
on your little body.

12:37.107 --> 12:39.407
Oh, my God. M-Mr. Harman?

12:39.509 --> 12:42.277
I feel so happy.

12:42.379 --> 12:44.412
But also...

12:44.514 --> 12:46.481
sleepy.

12:46.583 --> 12:47.627
Oh, boy!

12:49.253 --> 12:50.580
<i>With Harman in the hospital,</i>

12:50.643 --> 12:51.838
<i>I was pretty sure starting a company</i>

12:51.901 --> 12:53.554
<i>had been the biggest mistake of my...</i>

12:53.618 --> 12:54.784
<i>Oh, no.</i>

12:54.852 --> 12:57.185
<i>Magic.</i>

12:57.296 --> 12:59.109
Hey, buddy.

12:59.190 --> 13:00.223
What you doing?

13:00.289 --> 13:01.521
Getting ready for the talent show.

13:01.624 --> 13:03.690
- Want to see?
- Uh, sure.

13:03.792 --> 13:06.426
It's like a... glorious ballet.

13:06.528 --> 13:08.862
Listen, did I ever tell you
that in high school,

13:08.964 --> 13:10.697
I was in the AV club?

13:10.799 --> 13:12.799
We'd go around setting up VCRs,

13:12.901 --> 13:16.312
and I thought I was so cool
at the time, but...

13:16.383 --> 13:17.882
What's a VCR?

13:17.983 --> 13:21.585
Oh. That was...
That was back there, huh?

13:21.687 --> 13:24.054
I just mean,
with the talent show, man, may...

13:24.156 --> 13:27.257
maybe think about just flying
under the radar a little bit.

13:27.359 --> 13:30.961
T-That's what I did,
and I-I got pretty good at it.

13:31.063 --> 13:32.429
You know what? That's a good idea.

13:32.531 --> 13:34.765
- Maybe I'll go a different way.
- Really?

13:34.867 --> 13:36.834
Dad, we are totally on the same page.

13:36.936 --> 13:38.168
Okay. Great.

13:40.000 --> 13:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:56.088 --> 13:57.354
Did you brush your teeth?

13:57.456 --> 13:58.689
This <i> is</i> how I brush my teeth.

14:03.429 --> 14:05.629
Oh, dramatic sigh.

14:05.731 --> 14:08.265
I want to talk about it, babe.
I do. I just need one sec.

14:09.702 --> 14:12.603
Okay, I guess we're talking
about it <i> now.</i>

14:12.705 --> 14:14.371
Look, babe, I know you lost

14:14.473 --> 14:16.139
- your murderer today.
- Alleged.

14:16.242 --> 14:18.275
Just tell the investor
that you're gonna think

14:18.377 --> 14:20.811
of millions of other shows,
'cause you are.

14:20.913 --> 14:22.512
You're a very persuasive man.

14:22.615 --> 14:24.147
I knew that from the moment I met you.

14:24.250 --> 14:27.150
You mean when I threw up on your shoes?

14:27.253 --> 14:29.720
No, after that,
when you popped an Altoid

14:29.822 --> 14:31.221
and went right back to hitting on me.

14:32.625 --> 14:34.291
And, look, worst-case scenario...

14:34.393 --> 14:36.760
even if this doesn't work,
we're gonna be okay.

14:38.330 --> 14:39.563
Al?

14:39.665 --> 14:41.798
We <i> are</i> gonna be okay, right?

14:44.470 --> 14:46.637
Tell me you didn't touch the 401(K).

14:46.739 --> 14:48.839
- Rooni, calm face.
- I don't want to do calm face!

14:48.941 --> 14:50.674
Wait. Babe, I can explain what happened.

14:50.776 --> 14:52.476
- Rooni! Rooni!
- No, you know what?

14:52.578 --> 14:53.977
This last month has been hard.

14:54.079 --> 14:56.046
I have been picking up cases
to make more money,

14:56.148 --> 14:58.315
racing home for the kids
because Rosalba claims,

14:58.417 --> 14:59.917
"Only the devil is up after 7:00,"

15:00.019 --> 15:02.019
and I have tried not to complain

15:02.121 --> 15:04.154
because I really want you
to have your shot.

15:04.256 --> 15:06.256
But you know what would have
been nice in return?

15:06.358 --> 15:07.658
Not spending the 401(K)?

15:07.760 --> 15:10.694
Not lying to the person who's
supposed to be your best friend.

15:16.001 --> 15:17.834
<i>Well, if the night before
wasn't bad enough,</i>

15:17.937 --> 15:20.270
<i>the morning of the biggest day
of my life was even worse.</i>

15:20.372 --> 15:21.738
Rosalba is dead to me.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.607
- She has a tummy ache.
- No, she didn't call in sick.

15:23.709 --> 15:25.208
She called in "old," which I don't think

15:25.311 --> 15:26.944
you're even allowed to do.

15:27.046 --> 15:28.779
<i>So, here we are, back where we started.</i>

15:28.881 --> 15:30.747
<i>And, as you can see, I'm nailing it.</i>

15:30.849 --> 15:32.582
Look, my plane's waiting for me
at Teterboro.

15:32.685 --> 15:35.118
So when I'm on the fence
about something like this,

15:35.220 --> 15:36.586
what I like to ask is,

15:36.689 --> 15:39.423
"Why are <i> you</i> gonna succeed
when others will fail?"

15:39.525 --> 15:42.025
I like to call it
a company's unfair advantage.

15:42.127 --> 15:43.026
So what's yours?

15:43.128 --> 15:44.728
<i>Unfair advantage?</i>

15:44.830 --> 15:46.263
<i>I was ready for a lot of questions,</i>

15:46.365 --> 15:47.898
<i>but this was not one of them.</i>

15:48.000 --> 15:49.700
<i>So instead, I did the only logical thing</i>

15:49.802 --> 15:51.501
<i>someone in my position would do.</i>

15:54.039 --> 15:56.120
Well, I have <i> no</i> idea what that was.

15:56.175 --> 15:57.441
It's better with a hamster.

15:57.543 --> 15:59.910
Look, bro, I got to go. Till next time.

16:00.012 --> 16:01.278
Goodbye, tiny friend.

16:01.380 --> 16:02.546
Peace out!

16:02.632 --> 16:03.647
Your smoothie, ma'am.

16:03.749 --> 16:05.148
Ooh! Thank you.

16:05.250 --> 16:06.550
You ordered a smoothie?

16:06.652 --> 16:08.352

- Shh!
- I'm sorry.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.553
But in my defense,
none of those are the notes.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.176
- Not one.
- I think it's beautiful.

16:46.271 --> 16:48.505
Well, you need a new set of ears,
then, 'cause those are broken.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.582
♪ Love me-e-e-e-e ♪

16:52.545 --> 16:54.312
Look, I know you're giving me
the silent treatment right now,

16:54.414 --> 16:55.980
but if it would make you feel
better to say "I told you so,"

16:56.082 --> 16:57.281
go right ahead, 'cause nothing could

16:57.384 --> 16:58.950
possibly make me feel worse.

16:59.052 --> 17:03.021
Next up... Ben Schuman's
Magical World of Illusion!

17:03.123 --> 17:04.689
I stand corrected.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.526
Greetings, mortals!

17:08.627 --> 17:10.194
He told me he wasn't gonna do this.

17:10.296 --> 17:16.634
Prepare to be transported
to a magical land of wonder...

17:16.736 --> 17:18.670
and illusion.

17:21.441 --> 17:22.440
Loser!

17:23.609 --> 17:25.510
Now I need a volunteer.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.944
What about you?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.780
Come on. Don't be shy.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.381
Let's give her some encouragement, yeah?

17:30.426 --> 17:31.254
Yeah.

17:35.255 --> 17:37.889
Yes, very nice.
Big round of applause for, um...

17:37.991 --> 17:39.057
Sorry. What's your name?

17:39.159 --> 17:42.026
- Chloe.
- Chloe, everyone!

17:42.128 --> 17:43.394
Chloe!

17:43.496 --> 17:44.662
We're gonna have to move.

17:44.764 --> 17:47.331
All right, now, in you go, Chloe.

17:47.434 --> 17:49.033
All right. Perfect.

17:49.135 --> 17:50.301
You comfy?

17:51.938 --> 17:55.373
And now comes the fun part...

17:55.475 --> 17:59.177
real... steel... swords!

17:59.279 --> 18:00.545
Where the hell did he get swords?

18:00.647 --> 18:01.546
I have no idea.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.414
And now, dear Chloe,

18:03.516 --> 18:08.820
I am about to transport you
to a land of wonder.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.388
Oh, my God!

18:10.490 --> 18:12.356
Uh, uh, wha... No, no, no, no, no!

18:12.459 --> 18:13.991
No, no, no, Chloe! I'm so sorry, Chloe!

18:14.094 --> 18:16.327
No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Uh, uh...

18:16.429 --> 18:18.763
Chloe?! Chloe?!

18:21.201 --> 18:23.501
Well, that's strange.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.536
- Oh, my God!
- Oh...

18:25.638 --> 18:27.772
Chloe?

18:28.942 --> 18:30.341
Yeah!

18:30.433 --> 18:31.342
Whoo!

18:31.444 --> 18:33.143
That was amazing!

18:34.347 --> 18:36.848
Yeah! That's my son!

18:36.950 --> 18:39.517
That's my son!

18:39.619 --> 18:41.919
- Dude, that was awesome!
- Ben, that was incredible!

18:42.021 --> 18:43.221
- Oh, my God!
- Thank you.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.223
- That was so amazing!
- Thanks.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.058
I thought you said you were
gonna go a different way.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.226
I did.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.461
Until today, Chloe was my assistant.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.029
When you said, "Fly under the radar,"

18:52.132 --> 18:53.598
I figured you meant
plant her in the audience

18:53.700 --> 18:54.932
as a reluctant volunteer.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.635
That's <i> exactly</i> what I meant.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.404
You nailed it. You nailed it.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.573
You know, I-I saw some kids
give some mean looks,

19:02.675 --> 19:04.108
but you just kept going.

19:04.210 --> 19:05.309
That was so brave, Ben.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.911
People who think magic is lame

19:07.013 --> 19:08.946
just haven't seen
the right person do it yet.

19:09.048 --> 19:11.215
I know how to make magic cool.

19:11.317 --> 19:12.450
It's like you.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.986
- <i>Nobody</i> thinks radio is cool...
- Mm...

19:15.088 --> 19:18.156
...but when <i> you</i> do it, it's amazing.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.660
What? What did I say?

19:22.762 --> 19:25.096
Exactly what I needed to hear.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.632
Everybody... in the van!

19:27.734 --> 19:29.634
We've got a plane to catch.

19:35.575 --> 19:36.741
Hold on!

19:44.717 --> 19:46.517
- Mr. Sacca, wait!
- Schuman?

19:46.619 --> 19:47.985
How the hell did you get out here?

19:48.087 --> 19:49.954
I... may have driven through
a security gate,

19:50.056 --> 19:51.689
but I had to tell you something.

19:51.791 --> 19:54.859
You asked me earlier... what's
my company's unfair advantage?

19:54.961 --> 19:56.527
Well, it's me.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.362
What I do is really, really hard,

19:58.464 --> 20:00.198
and no one does it better than I do.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.166
So if you don't want in, that's fine.

20:02.268 --> 20:03.801
I will find someone who does,

20:03.903 --> 20:07.638
and I will make them very, very rich.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.440
Much richer than this.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.443
All right!

20:12.545 --> 20:14.478
That's what I've been
looking for from you, man!

20:14.581 --> 20:15.713
Some fire!

20:15.815 --> 20:17.448
I mean, driving up here like this,

20:17.550 --> 20:19.383
- busting through that gate...
- I know!

20:19.485 --> 20:22.119
...which those guys are
definitely gonna arrest you for.

20:23.590 --> 20:24.655
That's passion.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.390
That's what it takes to build a company.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.093
But before I go all-in,
I still got to know,

20:29.195 --> 20:30.494
what's the first show about?

20:30.597 --> 20:34.665
<i>Okay, it was time to shine,
but my mind went blank.</i>

20:34.767 --> 20:36.400
It should be this.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.171
Yes! Yes! This is the show.

20:40.273 --> 20:41.706
This is the first show.

20:41.808 --> 20:45.142
It... It... It's a show
about a-a guy like me

20:45.245 --> 20:47.211
with a family like them.

20:47.313 --> 20:50.047
Yeah, a guy who has no business
starting his own business,

20:50.149 --> 20:52.350
but he's going for it anyway.

20:52.452 --> 20:54.085
And he'll make lots of mistakes.

20:54.187 --> 20:55.186
He'll lie to his wife.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.888
Only once.

20:56.990 --> 20:58.389
And she'll forgive him?

20:59.525 --> 21:00.558
Eventually.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.592
Maybe.

21:04.197 --> 21:05.529
A-And we don't know how it'll turn out.

21:05.632 --> 21:08.032
I mean, he could succeed, he could fail,

21:08.134 --> 21:10.001
but either way, I promise you,

21:10.103 --> 21:13.237
people are gonna love to watch him try.

21:13.339 --> 21:14.505
I love it.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.607
It's the American dream.

21:16.709 --> 21:17.942
I'm in.

21:18.044 --> 21:20.244
Yes! What did I tell you?!

21:23.116 --> 21:24.682
Thank you, Mr. Sacca!

21:24.784 --> 21:26.550
We did it! Whoo-hoo!

21:26.653 --> 21:28.953
This is the best day of my life!

21:29.055 --> 21:31.055
Oh, wow, that really hurt.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.791
Okay, listen,
are handcuffs really necessary?

21:33.893 --> 21:36.127
My family's here.
What am I gonna do? Run away?

21:36.229 --> 21:38.029
Sorry, buddy. That's protocol.

21:38.131 --> 21:40.598
Protocol.
