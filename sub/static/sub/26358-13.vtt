WEBVTT

01:08.068 --> 01:10.244
That's not-- That's not it.

01:10.287 --> 01:12.289
We'll see.

01:15.901 --> 01:17.468
Good.

01:19.296 --> 01:22.212
A good man would
put a bullet in your head,

01:22.256 --> 01:24.171
put you out of your misery.

01:25.868 --> 01:27.957
Leave him.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.698
Let's go.

02:01.164 --> 02:04.472
You sure every camera, all
the microphones, they're off?

02:04.515 --> 02:06.169
Yes. I checked twice.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.562
Let's go, come on.

02:07.605 --> 02:10.478
I'm not messing around, Beale.
You're positive?

02:10.521 --> 02:14.264
Deeks... I'm here to help.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.396
Say it.

02:17.572 --> 02:20.227
Okay.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.446
"I vow with all my heart

02:22.490 --> 02:24.405
"to always be there for you

02:24.448 --> 02:25.623
"in every way
that you might need,

02:25.667 --> 02:27.669
and I vow..."
Okay.

02:27.712 --> 02:28.713
I'm just gonna-- I'm gonna
stop you right there.

02:28.757 --> 02:30.889
I'm just gonna say
a little louder.

02:30.933 --> 02:32.848
Right? The vows are-are

02:32.891 --> 02:35.329
a public proclamation
of your love.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.200
Public and love,

02:37.244 --> 02:39.507
not exactly my forte.
Cool.

02:39.550 --> 02:42.162
But, uh, if she can't hear it,
kinda defeats the purpose.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.207
So, uh, try again,
with gusto.Okay.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.339
So, from the diaphragm.

02:47.079 --> 02:48.646
"I vow with all of my heart

02:48.690 --> 02:50.213
"to always be there for you

02:50.257 --> 02:53.042
"in every way
that you might need.

02:53.085 --> 02:56.045
And I vow to be by your side

02:56.088 --> 02:58.700
in sickness and in health and--"

02:58.743 --> 03:00.658
Oh, my God,
I am gonna kill myself

03:00.702 --> 03:01.920
if I have
to say this out loud.No, no, no, it's good,

03:01.964 --> 03:03.357
it's good. Keep going.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.532
It's good, really?

03:04.575 --> 03:05.794
'Cause it doesn't feel
like it's good.

03:05.837 --> 03:06.795
No, well, it's--

03:06.838 --> 03:07.796
You know, it's like, um...

03:07.839 --> 03:08.884
How do I say this?

03:08.927 --> 03:10.059
It's ordinary?

03:10.102 --> 03:11.452
Ordinary is good.

03:11.495 --> 03:12.540
Is it?

03:12.583 --> 03:13.976
'Cause it doesn't feel good.

03:14.019 --> 03:15.020
Is that what you
would say with Nell?

03:15.064 --> 03:16.283
Me?
Yeah.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.327
Hell no.
Are you kidding me?

03:17.371 --> 03:18.720
Okay, so then what
would you say?

03:18.763 --> 03:20.461
Um...
Um?

03:20.504 --> 03:21.636
Huh.Mm.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.028
Hmm. Mm.It's tough, right?

03:23.072 --> 03:24.639
You want to know why
it's tough?

03:24.682 --> 03:26.728
It's because everything
has already been said.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.687
I taketh my lady into my soul,

03:29.731 --> 03:32.821
and vow to defend thee savagely

03:32.864 --> 03:34.039
with this sword...Okay.

03:34.083 --> 03:35.650
...as if it were my
own beating heart.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.652
For thou art, from
this day forward...
"Thou?"

03:37.695 --> 03:38.914
Okay.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.829
...mine own heart.Seems a little excessive.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.310
Thy love, the blood
in my veins...
Yeah.

03:43.353 --> 03:46.269
...thy joy, the air in my lungs.

03:46.313 --> 03:47.314
You obviously haven't put
any thought into this at all.

03:47.357 --> 03:50.012
For without thy love and joy...

03:50.055 --> 03:54.321
Should I write this down?...I surely wouldst wither
and-and die...

03:54.364 --> 03:56.279
Uh-huh....as swiftly as without...

03:56.323 --> 03:58.716
as without air, and-and blood.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.022
Uh, yoo-hoo.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.067
Hey.

04:02.111 --> 04:04.548
Hi.How-How's it going?
Uh, uh,

04:04.592 --> 04:05.462
did you hear any of that?

04:05.506 --> 04:06.768
Mm, no.

04:06.811 --> 04:07.769
I didn't hear anything.

04:07.812 --> 04:08.987
So we have a case.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.032
Kensi's heading to the Audi,

04:10.075 --> 04:11.599
and the address is
on your phone.

04:11.642 --> 04:12.991
I have never been more happy
to hear those words.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.994
And Beale-- good work.

04:17.735 --> 04:18.997
Are you sure you didn't
hear any of that?

04:19.041 --> 04:20.347
Nope.

04:20.390 --> 04:22.349
Why do I feel like
you're lying to me?

04:22.392 --> 04:24.351
Eric, I would never lie to you.

04:25.656 --> 04:27.397
My lord.

04:44.936 --> 04:46.721
DEEKS:
Alex Elmslie.

04:46.764 --> 04:48.288
It's been a long time, brother.Good to see you.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.550
Yeah, good to see you
as well.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.116
I wish it was under
better circumstances.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.509
Yeah, what are we looking at?Uh, wait a moment.

04:52.553 --> 04:54.381
What's wrong?

04:54.424 --> 04:56.426
I was supposed to meet
David Sarraf.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.124
He's a Syrian working for
the Global Criminal Tribunal.

04:59.168 --> 05:00.212
So you're still with GCT?

05:00.256 --> 05:01.823
Yes.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.478
David told me he had video
of Assad ordering

05:04.521 --> 05:05.783
a chemical weapons attack

05:05.827 --> 05:07.568
that eventually killed
19 civilians,

05:07.611 --> 05:09.787
seven of them children.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.400
It could change everything
if GCT had that.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.923
You're still doing
God's work, Elmslie.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.272
Thank you, but I don't
feel like the Big Man's

05:16.316 --> 05:18.361
on our side right now.

05:18.405 --> 05:20.581
David never showed up
last night.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.365
The police found him here.

05:22.409 --> 05:25.368
A car had driven into him,
crushing him against the wall.

05:25.412 --> 05:26.804
DEEKS: Assad could have people
in the country.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.110
Were there any witnesses?

05:28.153 --> 05:30.373
David didn't die last night.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.636
So, what, is he conscious?

05:35.291 --> 05:37.293
David is still trapped
between the car and the wall.

05:37.337 --> 05:38.990
Oh, my God.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.905
His lower half was
completely crushed,

05:40.949 --> 05:43.430
but the SUV's pressure is
preventing any blood loss.

05:43.473 --> 05:45.301
Are they gonna try and move him?

05:45.345 --> 05:49.044
As soon as they move the car,
he'll die almost immediately.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.745
Do you want to speak to him?Yeah.

05:54.789 --> 05:55.964
Absolutely.

06:02.666 --> 06:06.366
David, this is NCIS
Special Agent Kensi Blye

06:06.409 --> 06:07.628
and Detective Deeks.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.760
You can trust them.Hi, David.

06:09.804 --> 06:11.196
How you doing?

06:11.240 --> 06:14.025
Aside from not feeling
my legs, I'm just wonderful.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.202
Can you tell us what happened?

06:17.246 --> 06:20.031
I received the encrypted file.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.903
As I was downloading it
from the laptop,

06:21.946 --> 06:24.819
I heard men trying
to break into the room.

06:24.862 --> 06:28.083
I grabbed the flash drive, and
I left through the fire escape.

06:28.126 --> 06:30.433
I sent people to his room,
but the laptop is gone,

06:30.477 --> 06:31.739
so there's no copy.

06:31.782 --> 06:34.568
I was followed.
There were six or seven of them.

06:34.611 --> 06:35.438
KENSI:
Did you know any of them?

06:35.482 --> 06:38.180
No. They were Syrian.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.660
My guess, Mukhabarat.

06:39.703 --> 06:42.358
That's the Syrian military
intelligence directorate.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.012
Yeah, Assad's secret police.

06:44.055 --> 06:46.406
Currently, Syrians are not
allowed in the country.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.929
I'm gonna see what Eric
and Nell can dig up.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.539
Yeah.

06:49.583 --> 06:51.019
Sorry. Thank you.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.717
So, when they left,
did they leave on foot,

06:53.761 --> 06:55.023
or did they get into
another vehicle?

06:55.066 --> 06:57.199
They got into an SUV.

06:57.242 --> 07:01.986
It was, uh...
a Highlander.

07:02.030 --> 07:04.249
It was black.

07:04.293 --> 07:07.035
I can't believe
I remembered that.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.519
It's getting hard to breathe.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.172
I need to talk to my wife.

07:14.216 --> 07:15.913
We're trying. It's tough to
get her on the line. Damascus...

07:15.957 --> 07:17.524
I need to speak to her. I--

07:17.567 --> 07:20.483
David, everybody at GCT
is working on it.

07:22.137 --> 07:25.706
This is, uh, a little scary.It's okay. Hang in there.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.403
We're right here.
We're here for you, okay?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.753
We're right here.
DEEKS:
So, Eric ran facial rec

07:29.797 --> 07:30.885
of all immigrants
and visitors

07:30.928 --> 07:32.713
currently in the U.S.
against names

07:32.756 --> 07:34.323
of known members in Mukhabarat.

07:34.366 --> 07:36.020
According to his
Lebanese passport,

07:36.064 --> 07:37.805
his name is Rashid Mourtada.

07:37.848 --> 07:39.676
That's him.All right.

07:39.720 --> 07:41.722
Well, his real name is
General Joram Naser.

07:41.765 --> 07:43.854
He's Syrian, but he's here on a
Lebanese diplomatic passport.

07:43.898 --> 07:44.942
We're gonna get this guy.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.335
You did good.

07:46.378 --> 07:48.032
Eric, Nell, black Highlander.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.513
Joram Naser's the man.
Kaleidoscope, facial rec,

07:50.557 --> 07:52.297
throw everything we got at him.
I want this guy.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.561
The flash drive is
vitally important.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.258
It could save hundreds
of thousands of lives.

07:56.301 --> 07:57.564
It could get the West
to intervene

07:57.607 --> 07:58.869
and possibly end the war.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.262
We both know they
probably destroyed that

08:00.305 --> 08:01.916
two minutes after
they took it from him.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.613
Maybe not.

08:03.657 --> 08:04.962
It was encrypted.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.749
Naser would need to know
he actually had it.

08:08.792 --> 08:11.273
He won't destroy it until he's
sure he got what he came for.

08:11.316 --> 08:13.188
So there's still a chance.

08:13.231 --> 08:15.277
Hey, we got the Highlander
driving away from the alley,

08:15.320 --> 08:17.366
and an hour later,
sitting in the parking lot

08:17.409 --> 08:18.585
of the Sheraton in Studio City.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.325
Callen and Sam are
on their way.

08:20.369 --> 08:21.544
All right, tell 'em we'll
meet 'em there. We gotta go.

08:21.588 --> 08:25.766
Kensi, please.
Yes, David?

08:25.809 --> 08:27.332
Don't leave.

08:29.596 --> 08:32.294
Deeks?Absolutely.
You should stay.

08:32.337 --> 08:34.557
See if he can ID any
of the men with Naser.

08:34.601 --> 08:37.342
Thank you.
DEEKS: We got this.
You did good.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.752
Federal agents!

08:56.536 --> 08:58.102
Clear.
Clear.

08:58.146 --> 09:00.322
Clear.

09:03.064 --> 09:05.675
Hey, uh, Eric just found
hotel security footage

09:05.719 --> 09:08.025
of Naser and the team
leaving their room

09:08.069 --> 09:09.244
20 minutes before you got there.

09:09.287 --> 09:10.898
He's looking for
the black Highlander now.

09:10.941 --> 09:13.030
Copy that.He's gonna try to
leave the country.

09:13.074 --> 09:14.423
If he doesn't have the skills
or the tools

09:14.466 --> 09:16.164
to break the encryption code
on that flash drive,

09:16.207 --> 09:18.601
he might try
to take it with him.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.648
Check out the gray SUV
behind me.

09:21.691 --> 09:23.780
Tinted windows?Mm-hmm.

09:23.824 --> 09:26.348
CALLEN: It's been sitting there
since we arrived.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.523
If we make him, he's gonna run.

09:45.019 --> 09:47.195
Put your hands on the wheel!

09:47.238 --> 09:49.284
Do not lower 'em
out of sight.

09:49.327 --> 09:51.808
Now, get out of the car slowly.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.742
We could have shot you.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.265
So now you're
following us?

10:14.309 --> 10:15.919
You sound paranoid.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.921
Well, it's either that
or you're on a staycation

10:17.965 --> 10:19.401
here all by yourself.

10:19.444 --> 10:21.011
You're looking for Joram Naser;

10:21.055 --> 10:22.665
so am I.Why are you on this?

10:22.709 --> 10:25.625
DHS facial rec pinged Naser
and a group of his guys

10:25.668 --> 10:27.191
going through immigration.

10:27.235 --> 10:30.064
Problem was, the alert came in
about four hours too late,

10:30.107 --> 10:31.935
and now they're in the country
under aliases,

10:31.979 --> 10:33.328
using Lebanese passports,

10:33.371 --> 10:34.938
which can't
be a great.

10:34.982 --> 10:37.593
Why are you on this?SAM: Slow down, Opie.
You saw us.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.160
Why'd you try to run?Because if you knew

10:39.203 --> 10:41.205
that I was on the case,
I might get pulled,

10:41.249 --> 10:44.078
and I got nearly a month in on
this trying to find these guys.

10:46.123 --> 10:50.954
So now, one more time, with
feeling: why are you on this?

10:50.998 --> 10:53.870
He stole a flash drive
from a human rights worker.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.003
It was video evidence
of Assad ordering

10:56.046 --> 10:58.179
a chemical weapons attack
on civilians.

10:58.222 --> 11:01.530
Well, now I know why he's here.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.010
We gonna work together on this?

11:03.053 --> 11:04.054
For now.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.404
Love you, too.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.321
KENSI: Wow.
He looks like you.

11:10.365 --> 11:11.322
You find my Instagram?

11:11.366 --> 11:13.498
Yeah, I did.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.500
Your son is so beautiful.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.154
Sur-Surray?

11:17.198 --> 11:18.503
"Surray" means "river."

11:18.547 --> 11:20.767
The flow of life.

11:20.810 --> 11:23.683
That's what he was
for me and my wife.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.686
Go two photos down.

11:28.992 --> 11:30.820
Assad's chemical
weapons attack.

11:30.864 --> 11:32.866
He was eight.

11:35.738 --> 11:37.522
I ran to his school

11:37.566 --> 11:40.917
and I carried him
to the hospital, and...

11:43.485 --> 11:47.097
...then I watched him die.

11:47.141 --> 11:50.057
I'm so sorry...It was horrible.

11:51.841 --> 11:54.757
Blood was coming out of his nose
and his mouth and...

11:58.674 --> 12:01.459
He was in incredible pain.

12:04.419 --> 12:07.422
Fighting to breathe.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.434
That's why you joined the GCT.

12:19.477 --> 12:22.654
We are fighting a beast.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.440
He murders children.

12:25.483 --> 12:29.270
And the world just looks on
like it's YouTube.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.881
They do nothing.

12:31.925 --> 12:36.407
I was most certainly
not going to do nothing.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.757
Well, you're a hero, David.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.063
That flash drive

12:40.107 --> 12:42.239
is truth dragged
into light.

12:42.283 --> 12:45.242
If we don't get it,
my life will have no purpose.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.114
Surray's life
will have no purpose.

12:47.157 --> 12:50.334
All there will be is darkness.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.252
I'm sorry.

12:55.296 --> 12:57.254
It's okay.I'm so sorry.

12:58.299 --> 12:59.735
DEEKS:
Hey.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.997
No Naser.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.999
Yeah, I heard.How's David doing?

13:03.043 --> 13:04.696
Okay. I mean, he's conscious.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.220
It's just all really surreal,
you know?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.178
His son died
in a chemical weapons attack.

13:08.222 --> 13:11.007
Oh, my God.

13:11.051 --> 13:13.270
Honestly, I don't know
how you come back from that.

13:13.314 --> 13:15.316
I don't think you do.

13:18.362 --> 13:19.494
Um...

13:19.537 --> 13:21.409
Does he remember
anything else about

13:21.452 --> 13:22.584
Naser's men?

13:22.627 --> 13:24.064
Uh, yes. He said one of them had

13:24.107 --> 13:27.067
red shoes, like basketball
shoes, a red T-shirt

13:27.110 --> 13:30.244
under a black sweat suit
with a red stripe,

13:30.287 --> 13:31.767
like it all matched.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.987
Red shoes, black sweat suit.
Color-coordinated.

13:34.030 --> 13:36.380
All right, got it.
I'm gonna call Beale.

13:39.035 --> 13:41.559
ERIC: That's Red Shoes. All
right, I got him at the hotel.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.692
Got his vehicle, plates.
It's a white Camry.

13:43.735 --> 13:46.521
Traffic cam picked him up
on Hayvenhurst

13:46.564 --> 13:48.001
just outside Van Nuys Airport.

13:48.044 --> 13:49.437
He's trying to get a private
plane out of the country.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.568
CALLEN: Let us know
if he makes a move.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.483
ERIC: All right.NELL: Yep.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.050
All right, we
can't seem to get

13:54.094 --> 13:55.486
David's wife on
the line in Syria.

13:55.530 --> 13:57.227
There's almost no
infrastructure left.

13:57.271 --> 13:58.750
It's most likely
not going to happen.

13:58.794 --> 14:00.752
No, no, no.
You have got to keep trying.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.363
Elmslie, this is
not an option.We will.

14:02.406 --> 14:03.668
Look, right now,
you're the person

14:03.712 --> 14:05.627
closest to him that we've got.
He trusts you.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.498
He seems to be calmer
talking to you.

14:07.542 --> 14:10.110
I was just speaking with
the doctors just now,

14:10.153 --> 14:12.634
and it seems like it might
be best for you to tell him.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.505
What does that mean?
What are you trying to say?

14:16.072 --> 14:18.335
That when they move the car,
he's gonna die.

14:18.379 --> 14:21.077
He doesn't know?

14:21.121 --> 14:22.383
We were trying to get his wife
on the line.

14:22.426 --> 14:23.906
We wanted to see how
that was gonna be handled.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.908
No, Elmslie,
I am not the person...

14:25.952 --> 14:26.953
Just-just think about it.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.519
Okay?

14:31.653 --> 14:34.134
It would be a good thing.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.796
CALLEN: Federal agents!SAM: Do not run!

14:44.840 --> 14:46.189
CALLEN:
He's not listening.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.980
G? Watch it, watch it!

14:56.199 --> 14:58.027
Out of the car!

14:59.463 --> 15:00.508
Put your hands where
I can see them.

15:00.551 --> 15:01.683
DEEKS: Put
your hands up!

15:01.726 --> 15:04.120
Slow. Nice and easy.Get out of the car.

15:04.164 --> 15:06.253
Get out of the car.
Move, move!Hands up.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.037
SAM: Turn around.DEEKS: On the ground, now!

15:09.473 --> 15:10.518
TURK: That's him.Let's go...

15:10.561 --> 15:11.823
That's him.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.086
CALLEN:
I got you covered.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.220
No weapon, no flash drive.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.961
We need that drive.I got him. Check the car.

15:19.005 --> 15:20.745
Hey, where's the drive?

15:20.789 --> 15:22.138
Hey. Easy.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.053
Where's the drive?!

15:24.097 --> 15:25.620
Where's the drive?

15:25.663 --> 15:27.187
What the hell?

15:27.230 --> 15:29.145
Turk.

15:29.189 --> 15:30.451
Come on, let him go, man.

15:30.494 --> 15:31.408
I'm just letting him know
who he's dealing with.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.366
Let him go!Talk to me!

15:32.409 --> 15:33.367
Hey, come on.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.804
I said that's enough.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.240
That's not close to enough.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.734
So why'd you run?

15:52.777 --> 15:55.563
I am not familiar
with the United States.

15:55.606 --> 15:58.044
I thought we were
being, uh, robbed.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.785
You think thieves yell "federal
agent" when they rob you?

16:00.829 --> 16:02.613
I didn't hear that.

16:02.657 --> 16:04.615
I, uh,
my English is not so good.

16:04.659 --> 16:06.574
You didn't hear it
or you didn't understand it?

16:06.617 --> 16:08.097
Clearly, neither.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.360
And you got no idea
where the flash drive is, huh?

16:10.404 --> 16:12.362
Hmm?
So sorry.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.016
I don't really know
what you're talking about.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.104
CALLEN:
And just to be clear,

16:15.148 --> 16:17.280
you're not Syrian general
Joram Naser?

16:17.324 --> 16:19.761
My name is Rashid Mourtada.

16:19.804 --> 16:21.328
I am Lebanese.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.852
And I am traveling under
a diplomatic passport.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.072
Right now, no one
knows you're here,

16:26.115 --> 16:28.291
so don't get too
excited about that.

16:28.335 --> 16:30.467
CALLEN: Yeah, we lose you
in the federal system

16:30.511 --> 16:31.729
'cause, say,
we got your name wrong,

16:31.773 --> 16:33.644
it may be weeks
before someone finds you.

16:33.688 --> 16:35.124
I don't know
how else to tell you.

16:35.168 --> 16:36.821
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.476
I'm here as an adviser
to a diplomatic team

16:39.520 --> 16:41.391
in the Lebanese consulate.

16:41.435 --> 16:45.352
You know, your English seems
pretty damn good to me.

16:50.618 --> 16:52.054
The clock is ticking
on this guy.

16:52.098 --> 16:53.838
State finds out we got
him, he could be released

16:53.882 --> 16:55.144
and out of the country
within hours.

16:55.188 --> 16:57.016
Let's just keep building
a case against him,

16:57.059 --> 16:58.669
make it that much harder
for them to cut him loose.

16:58.713 --> 16:59.931
CALLEN: We'll see what we can
get out of Red Shoes.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.890
You guys take Naser
over to David Sarraf.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.718
Let's at least get
a positive ID out
of him while we still can.

17:03.761 --> 17:05.154
So we're gonna have David ID

17:05.198 --> 17:08.027
the man that killed him
before he dies.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.854
TURK: And
you thought

17:09.898 --> 17:11.204
I was too rough on him.

17:15.295 --> 17:17.384
TURK:
Get up. Move.

17:17.427 --> 17:20.169
CALLEN:
Something's going on with him.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.084
Keep your eyes open.

17:22.128 --> 17:23.259
On it.

17:35.445 --> 17:36.707
KENSI:
They're here.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.361
Are you ready to do this? Yeah?Yeah.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.929
Definitely.David, if you're ready,

17:40.972 --> 17:42.974
we're gonna record
your statement.

17:44.454 --> 17:45.542
Okay.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.501
All right, you good?

17:47.544 --> 17:48.676
TURK:
Rolling.

17:48.719 --> 17:52.419
I'm Detective
Martin Deeks, LAPD.

17:52.462 --> 17:55.074
I'm Special Agent
Kensi Blye, NCIS.

17:55.117 --> 17:56.118
DEEKS: This is
being recorded

17:56.162 --> 17:59.078
by NCIS Special Agent Arlo Turk.

17:59.121 --> 18:01.993
It is January 14,
2019, 10:04 a.m.

18:02.037 --> 18:04.518
Please state your name,
date of birth and nationality.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.260
David Sarraf, November 10, 1981.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.305
I am Syrian.DEEKS:
And please tell us

18:09.349 --> 18:10.393
what happened last night.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.395
I was chased by this man.

18:12.439 --> 18:15.094
From NCIS's investigation
thus far, we believe

18:15.137 --> 18:17.618
this is Syrian general
Joram Naser.

18:17.661 --> 18:18.619
Please tell us
what happened next.

18:18.662 --> 18:20.360
I was cornered
into this alleyway,

18:20.403 --> 18:22.231
and this man
drove his car into me.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.711
DEEKS: Please show
how Mr. Sarraf

18:23.754 --> 18:25.321
is pinned between
the wall and the car.

18:27.323 --> 18:29.238
Then he left me to die,

18:29.282 --> 18:30.935
but I didn't die.This is crazy.

18:30.979 --> 18:32.676
I have never seen
this man before.

18:32.720 --> 18:35.244
He took flash drive from me
that shows security footage

18:35.288 --> 18:36.985
of President Bashar
al-Assad ordering

18:37.028 --> 18:39.553
chemical weapons attacks
on his own citizens.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.729
And you're sure
that this man, Joram Naser,

18:41.772 --> 18:43.122
is the one that did this to you?

18:43.165 --> 18:45.036
Absolutely, with 100% certainty.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.342
DEEKS: Well, then,
we're done.

18:46.386 --> 18:48.605
And so are you.DAVID:
You've destroyed Syria.

18:48.649 --> 18:51.869
You and Assad killed hundreds of
thousands of innocent Syrians.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.175
You murdered children.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.959
I am Lebanese.
I don't have to listen to this.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.179
Yes, you do. And when the U.S.
courts are done with you,

18:57.223 --> 18:58.789
you'll be tried
in front of a world tribunal

18:58.833 --> 19:00.965
for crimes against humanity.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.750
You are all
clearly mistaken.
Let's go.

19:02.793 --> 19:05.144
You and Assad killed my son!

19:11.889 --> 19:13.848
Hey, it's okay.
Just breathe.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.547
What is this?

19:17.591 --> 19:19.897
Detective Martin Deeks,
Special Agent Arlo Turk,

19:19.941 --> 19:21.899
Anna Iloka, State Department.You want to tell us

19:21.943 --> 19:23.597
what this is all about?You are currently

19:23.640 --> 19:26.382
illegally holding
Rashid Mourtada.

19:26.426 --> 19:29.211
He's Lebanese, here as part
of a diplomatic team.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.431
You are to hand over
Mr. Mourtada immediately.

19:31.474 --> 19:33.041
I'm sorry,
you got to be kidding me.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.085
ELMSLIE:
This isn't Mourtada.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.304
This is General Joram Naser,

19:35.348 --> 19:37.219
and he's wanted
for crimes against humanity

19:37.263 --> 19:38.438
by the Global Criminal Tribunal.

19:38.481 --> 19:40.570
TURK: Not to mention,
in all likelihood,

19:40.614 --> 19:42.137
murder here in the U.S.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.747
This is a State Department
issue.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.749
It should have been brought
to our attention immediately.

19:45.793 --> 19:46.924
Uncuff him.

19:46.968 --> 19:48.056
ELMSLIE:
Hang on a second.

19:48.099 --> 19:49.231
ILOKA: He'll be returned
to his consulate

19:49.275 --> 19:51.102
and we'll begin investigating
his identity

19:51.146 --> 19:52.930
and the allegations against him.

19:52.974 --> 19:54.715
And if he should leave
the country in the interim?

19:54.758 --> 19:56.978
That's between us and
the Lebanese government.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.635
Come on. Let's go.

20:01.678 --> 20:02.766
We should have
been made aware.

20:02.810 --> 20:04.725
This is our purview,
and you know it.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.083
We cannot tell David

20:15.126 --> 20:16.476
that Naser was handed
to the State Department.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.260
I mean, how did they even
know that we had him?

20:18.304 --> 20:20.958
Look, I don't know.
Um, I have a problem.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.264
Talk to me.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.831
Elmslie wants me to be the one

20:23.874 --> 20:25.572
to tell David
that he's gonna die.

20:25.615 --> 20:26.834
What? Nobody told him?No.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.357
I think they're waiting
for his wife

20:28.401 --> 20:30.577
to get on the phone with him
or something, but...

20:30.620 --> 20:32.187
I just... I-I...

20:32.231 --> 20:34.015
I don't know what to do.

20:34.058 --> 20:38.585
I mean, deep down inside,
he's got to know he's dying.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.935
And if he knows that, and
his wife can't be here,

20:40.978 --> 20:42.806
then you're the person
he wants to be with,

20:42.850 --> 20:44.460
'cause you're his
connection to life.

20:44.504 --> 20:45.766
Listen, baby.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.812
Your kindness,
your humanity, your beauty...

20:50.205 --> 20:52.599
Gosh, this is not
how I saw my day going

20:52.642 --> 20:54.165
when I woke up this morning.

20:54.209 --> 20:56.124
Some days we put bad
guys in jail, right?

20:56.167 --> 20:57.865
And those are
the good days.
Yeah.

20:57.908 --> 20:59.649
And days like today,
the tough days,

20:59.693 --> 21:02.739
if you want to help, if you want
to do some good in this world...

21:04.350 --> 21:06.134
I should be the one to tell him.

21:06.177 --> 21:07.831
Baby, you're all he's got.

21:07.875 --> 21:11.792
But then, that means he
got pretty lucky today.

21:11.835 --> 21:14.142
DAVID:
I wish something

21:14.185 --> 21:15.622
I did or said to Naser

21:15.665 --> 21:18.886
would change the way I feel.

21:21.323 --> 21:24.631
But all I want in life is
to have my son back.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.023
I know.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.025
Putting Naser in jail
doesn't help that.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.679
Yeah, but it
might prevent somebody else

21:29.723 --> 21:31.072
from getting their son killed.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.035
You do know how to say
the right thing.

21:40.124 --> 21:42.083
What's wrong?

21:43.476 --> 21:45.652
I have to tell you
something, David.

21:48.611 --> 21:51.875
When they move this car,
you're going to die.

21:51.919 --> 21:55.662
And there's nothing
they can do about it.

21:55.705 --> 21:59.230
The car is the only thing
stopping you from bleeding out.

21:59.274 --> 22:00.362
I'm sorry.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.191
I understand.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.238
I'm so sorry, David.
I'm so sorry.

22:07.282 --> 22:09.676
Could you try and do
one thing for me?

22:09.719 --> 22:11.895
Oh, my gosh, of
course, of course.

22:11.939 --> 22:14.115
What-what do you need?
Anything. What do you need?

22:16.247 --> 22:19.425
Please help me hear
my wife's voice one more time.

22:20.861 --> 22:22.863
If I can just have that...

22:22.906 --> 22:24.343
Ab-Absolutely.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.996
David, of course.
I promise you,

22:26.040 --> 22:28.085
I promise you I'm
gonna get this done.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.218
Her name is Karima Sarraf.

22:30.261 --> 22:32.002
Okay.

22:33.613 --> 22:36.964
I guess I like people
whose name starts with "K."

22:38.095 --> 22:39.401
Kensi.

22:45.059 --> 22:47.496
Karima Sarraf. Okay.

22:47.540 --> 22:49.498
Thank you.Okay.

22:49.542 --> 22:50.543
Thank you.

22:53.415 --> 22:56.287
For being the one to tell me.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.817
Guys, I need to find somebody

23:03.860 --> 23:05.253
in Damascus who's gonna put

23:05.296 --> 23:06.515
David's wife on the phone.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.169
Her name is Karima Sarraf.

23:08.212 --> 23:11.433
Uh, I have a friend, his
name is Dr. Malcolm Smith.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.522
I'm pretty sure he's with
Doctors Without Borders

23:13.566 --> 23:14.697
in Syria right now.

23:14.741 --> 23:16.960
Also get Special Forces,
get journalists,

23:17.004 --> 23:19.093
get Red Crescent,
anybody that can put a satphone

23:19.136 --> 23:20.311
in Karima's hands.Got it.

23:20.355 --> 23:21.748
We don't have a lot of time.

23:27.275 --> 23:29.233
Thank you very, very much.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.627
Hey. Heard you
wanted to talk to me.

23:31.671 --> 23:33.368
I just spoke with my contact
at the State Department.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.326
Turns out they were
made aware that NCIS

23:35.370 --> 23:36.806
had custody
of a Lebanese national

23:36.850 --> 23:38.417
here on a diplomatic passport

23:38.460 --> 23:41.724
by NCIS agent Arlo Turk.Turk? What?

23:41.768 --> 23:43.987
He just left
15 minutes ago.

23:44.858 --> 23:46.512
He sold us out.Eric,

23:46.555 --> 23:48.557
I need to find Turk now.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.228
DEEKS:
So, what...

24:07.271 --> 24:09.839
no good-byes?You wanted a hug?

24:09.883 --> 24:12.233
I mean, detectives
have feelings, too.

24:12.276 --> 24:13.539
I'll buy you some
flowers later.

24:13.582 --> 24:14.888
Great. I love petunias.

24:14.931 --> 24:17.412
Lebanese consulate?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.022
We're too late.

24:19.066 --> 24:22.112
DSS turned him over; Lebanese
let Naser walk immediately.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.158
My guess is they're trying
to get him on a flight

24:24.201 --> 24:25.638
before we're able
to intercept him.

24:25.681 --> 24:27.466
Well, there's a good chance
we're not gonna find him

24:27.509 --> 24:28.902
and he's gonna get
out of the country,

24:28.945 --> 24:31.600
which just begs the
question to be asked...

24:31.644 --> 24:32.906
Why'd I tip
the State Department?

24:32.949 --> 24:34.124
Yeah.

24:34.168 --> 24:35.474
I mean, you screwed up
the whole operation.

24:40.914 --> 24:43.917
NCIS Special Agent
Ronnie Williams.

24:45.266 --> 24:48.008
He was my partner for six years.

24:48.051 --> 24:50.053
I'm godfather to his kids.

24:51.228 --> 24:54.667
Naser was running weapons
to Hezbollah in Lebanon.

24:54.710 --> 24:58.366
Naser made Ronnie,
swiped him off the street.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.541
A week later,

24:59.585 --> 25:01.021
I found his body.

25:01.064 --> 25:03.414
He'd been electrocuted
and burned.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.374
I still can't talk to his wife

25:06.417 --> 25:07.897
without her
breaking down in tears.

25:07.941 --> 25:10.987
There's not a conversation
in six years

25:11.031 --> 25:13.555
that woman
doesn't cry out in pain.

25:15.949 --> 25:18.952
I've been hunting this guy
ever since.

25:18.995 --> 25:22.042
That's why you
were at the hotel.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.957
You saw what he did to David.Yeah.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.568
What kind of human being
does that?Which is why

25:26.612 --> 25:28.178
you don't want him
in the system.

25:28.222 --> 25:29.876
I want him gone from this earth.

25:29.919 --> 25:31.747
Yeah, no, I can see that.So I suppose

25:31.791 --> 25:34.358
it'd be silly to ask you
not to mention this.

25:34.402 --> 25:36.230
You know that's
not gonna happen.

25:36.273 --> 25:38.580
We need him alive.
We need that drive.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.843
The drive's been destroyed,
and you know it.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.152
Wow. As if I needed
any more indication

25:45.195 --> 25:46.893
you're completely
out of control.

25:46.936 --> 25:49.722
I'm in complete control.

25:49.765 --> 25:51.288
You don't have
to do this.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.594
He's not worth your career.

25:52.638 --> 25:53.900
There's career...

25:53.943 --> 25:56.293
and then there's
living with yourself.

25:56.337 --> 25:57.251
I get that.No, you don't.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.601
Yeah, I do.No.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.777
You don't.

26:10.699 --> 26:12.875
Beale, I need you
to keep tabs on Turk's car,

26:12.919 --> 26:14.877
and need you to connect me
with Callen, quick.

26:14.921 --> 26:17.619
Oh, and order me
a frickin' Uber.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.362
Hey.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.320
DAVID: Did you
recover the drive?Not yet.

26:23.364 --> 26:24.670
Keep working on Naser.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.194
Do what it takes
to get him to talk.

26:28.543 --> 26:31.111
You're gonna keep working
on Naser, right?

26:31.154 --> 26:33.635
Don't give up.No, we would never do that.

26:33.679 --> 26:35.811
Just give us
a minute, okay?

26:35.855 --> 26:38.901
Guys... Please.

26:38.945 --> 26:42.470
Look, if Turk kills Naser,
this has all been a waste.

26:42.513 --> 26:44.037
We need the flash drive.I know.

26:44.080 --> 26:46.561
The evidence could save lives
and possibly end the war.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.432
We're gonna find Turk.
Sam and Callen are on it.

26:48.476 --> 26:49.956
Assad will pour money and men

26:49.999 --> 26:51.958
into getting Naser
and the flash drive back.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.089
Alex, we understand that.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.177
It was a selfish act.

26:54.221 --> 26:55.614
You should have been
ahead of this.

26:55.657 --> 26:57.224
We didn't know
what was going on.

26:57.267 --> 26:58.878
Turk is NCIS.
He's your agent.

26:58.921 --> 27:00.793
David has given his life
for that drive.

27:00.836 --> 27:02.664
Assad has killed children
in their sleep.

27:02.708 --> 27:03.970
This is on you
and your team.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.406
Find Naser.

27:07.147 --> 27:09.671
He's not wrong.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.587
No, he's not.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.937
I haven't gotten a hit on Turk's
phone in the last 30 minutes.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.156
SAM:
He must have turned it off.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.766
He stopped two blocks up.

27:17.810 --> 27:18.854
Looks like
it's a parking structure.

27:18.898 --> 27:19.986
I've got his car
on a security camera

27:20.029 --> 27:21.204
on the lower level--

27:21.248 --> 27:22.815
it's parked halfway down
on the right.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.860
ERIC:
Looks like he hasn't gotten out.SAM: Copy that.

27:31.388 --> 27:33.782
That's his car
down there on the right.I'll block him in.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.963
Maybe he'll let this thing
end peacefully.That's wishful thinking.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.185
Turk, get out.
There's nowhere to go.

27:45.228 --> 27:46.447
Let's talk it out, Turk.

27:47.578 --> 27:49.798
Uh, uh, I have no money.

27:49.842 --> 27:52.279
We're not robbing you.
We're federal agents.

27:52.322 --> 27:54.150
What's your name?Zahid.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.022
This isn't your car, Zahid.I drive Uber.

27:56.065 --> 27:58.459
A guy hit me on the app
and gave me $300

27:58.502 --> 28:00.374
to drive his car around
for an hour.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.202
Wasn't supposed
to stop.

28:02.245 --> 28:05.553
Can I still keep the money?

28:05.596 --> 28:07.642
DEEKS:
So you're telling me
we have no idea

28:07.686 --> 28:08.817
where Turk is?

28:08.861 --> 28:10.253
SAM:
Uber driver started off

28:10.297 --> 28:12.125
at Staples Center, but that
was over 30 minutes ago.

28:12.168 --> 28:13.648
Did you lose him?Hold on one second.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.736
CALLEN:
Let's think this through.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.737
Turk cut Naser loose,

28:15.781 --> 28:16.869
but he's not gonna lose him.Right.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.218
He must be tracking him somehow.

28:18.261 --> 28:19.610
Well, if he was smart,

28:19.654 --> 28:21.482
he would have tagged Naser
with Overwatch spray.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.920
Hey, Eric,

28:24.964 --> 28:27.183
check all the Overwatch trackers
in L.A., see if there were any

28:27.227 --> 28:28.750
around the Staples Center
about an hour ago.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.926
Uh, there were two.
One's currently in Pasadena,

28:30.970 --> 28:32.667
and the other one's
in Inglewood.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.929
We got Pasadena.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.670
I'll take Inglewood.
I need your car.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.628
Thank you, thank you. Just stay
right there and please hold.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.587
NELL: Hey, Kens?Yeah. I'm here.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.023
Your Doctors
Without Borders friend,

28:41.067 --> 28:43.243
he made it to David's apartment
and located his wife.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.245
He found Karima?NELL: He's there with her now.

28:45.288 --> 28:46.507
I have them both on the line.

28:46.550 --> 28:48.814
Just dial in.David, we found
your wife.

28:50.990 --> 28:53.079
Okay, Kens,
I'm patching you in now.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.123
Here.

28:56.038 --> 28:57.039
Karima?

29:01.740 --> 29:03.785
I love you so much.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.443
Just listen to me,
my love.

29:09.486 --> 29:12.011
There's something
I need to tell you.You know what, guys,

29:12.054 --> 29:14.361
if you could give us some
privacy, please? Thank you.

29:14.404 --> 29:17.712
I don't want this conversation
to be about what...

29:17.756 --> 29:19.148
I'm gonna tell you.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.153
I want this to be
about us.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.807
Our love.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.245
Please listen.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.160
Please. Just listen.

29:31.204 --> 29:33.423
There is so much to talk about.

31:40.768 --> 31:41.900
Federal agent!

31:43.423 --> 31:47.035
Yo, what up?

31:47.079 --> 31:48.863
Hey, is that you?Yeah, it's me, Raggedy Ann.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.604
Mind telling them
to stop firing and have

31:50.647 --> 31:53.128
a nice, little conversation?I don't think they'll listen.

31:53.172 --> 31:54.956
Then we should shut them up.I'd love to.

31:56.175 --> 31:59.830
One, two, three.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.316
What's up there, Carrot Top?

32:07.360 --> 32:09.405
Looks like that lifesaving's

32:09.449 --> 32:11.233
officially paid back.You got this?

32:11.277 --> 32:12.582
What do you mean
"do I got this"?

32:12.626 --> 32:14.019
What're you talking about?You're doing great.

32:14.062 --> 32:15.846
Confidence is high.Where are you... Turk!

32:53.058 --> 32:54.407
Ah...

33:37.885 --> 33:40.888
Uh, that's not how this goes.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.022
How does it go?

33:48.417 --> 33:49.853
You remember Ronnie Williams?

33:52.204 --> 33:55.033
Lebanon.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.035
2012.

33:58.732 --> 34:02.083
You burnt him,

34:02.127 --> 34:05.869
electrocuted him.

34:05.913 --> 34:08.046
Left his body in a junkyard.

34:10.396 --> 34:13.268
You do remember.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.885
He was my partner...

34:24.671 --> 34:26.803
and my friend.

34:37.292 --> 34:39.729
You gotta be kidding me.

34:47.433 --> 34:49.261
Ah!

34:49.304 --> 34:51.089
Son of a bitch.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.756
Hah. Ah...

35:07.583 --> 35:09.019
Ah!

35:12.458 --> 35:13.459
Yah!

35:18.290 --> 35:20.596
Come on!

35:49.364 --> 35:51.671
I just wish I had more time
to make you suffer.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.648
Clear.Clear.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.781
You guys know I had this, right?

36:14.824 --> 36:16.174
Yeah, sure.Where's Turk?

36:16.217 --> 36:17.479
He went after Naser.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.144
Turk?

36:33.582 --> 36:35.062
So how you want

What happened?He tripped.

37:13.405 --> 37:16.146
He took a bad fall.

37:16.190 --> 37:17.409
Yeah, he's going
to be okay, though.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.237
Are you gonna be all right?

Yeah.

37:22.936 --> 37:24.416
You did good.
You did amazing.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.853
Especially the part where
you just left me at the Alamo.

37:26.896 --> 37:30.073
Found this in his pocket.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.815
How you like me now?

37:34.295 --> 37:37.037
That's gonna

We got the drive.

37:43.304 --> 37:46.481
I got the drive.I got the drive.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.446
David, I've got
great news.

37:54.489 --> 37:57.623
Eric checked the drive.
It's all there.

37:57.666 --> 37:59.668
It's a good recording.
We've got him.

37:59.712 --> 38:00.843
The world will see

38:00.887 --> 38:02.802
what Assad is doing
to his own people.

38:02.845 --> 38:05.718
Praise be to Allah.

38:05.761 --> 38:08.329
You did it, David. You did it.

38:08.373 --> 38:09.809
I'm happy,

38:09.852 --> 38:13.334
but the thing is,

38:13.378 --> 38:15.336
when I spoke to my wife,

38:15.380 --> 38:19.340
I realized that my life
did have meaning...

38:19.384 --> 38:20.515
Yes.

38:20.559 --> 38:23.866
...whether you recovered
the drive or not.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.347
And the meaning was our love,

38:26.391 --> 38:30.264
my love for my son...Mm-hmm.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.747
...my father and my mother.

38:34.790 --> 38:38.098
Those are the
precious gifts.

38:38.141 --> 38:41.057
And even if I didn't have them
for as long as I'd hoped...

38:43.408 --> 38:46.411
I had them.

38:46.454 --> 38:48.369
Yeah.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.156
That's the important thing.

38:54.810 --> 38:58.684
I lived, I loved,

38:58.727 --> 39:01.513
and I was loved.

39:03.166 --> 39:07.954
What more can I ask from life?

39:09.782 --> 39:12.306
Not much more
than that.

39:16.354 --> 39:19.357
David?

39:19.400 --> 39:22.229
I'm ready.

39:25.885 --> 39:27.887
I'm ready.

39:29.976 --> 39:32.892
It's just a sedative,

39:32.935 --> 39:34.850
in case there's pain
when we move the car.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.474

39:49.517 --> 39:51.214
