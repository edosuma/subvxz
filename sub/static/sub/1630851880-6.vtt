00:08.208 --> 00:09.916
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL LOVE STORY

00:15.333 --> 00:22.333
SIX MINUTES IN THE PRESENT
AND FIVE MINUTES IN THE PAST

00:25.375 --> 00:28.166
-What are you doing, Pedro?
-What's wrong?

00:28.250 --> 00:32.500
We always do it the same way.
One, two, three, and we lift it, honey.

00:32.583 --> 00:33.416
Hi.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.666
-Hey.
-Hi!

00:34.750 --> 00:36.750
Happy birthday!

00:36.833 --> 00:38.083
Thank you.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.125
How exciting!

00:40.750 --> 00:42.208
-Hi, Pedro.
-Happy birthday.

00:42.291 --> 00:43.125
Thanks.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.000
Need a hand?

00:45.083 --> 00:46.458
-Yeah.
-Yes, yeah…

00:47.125 --> 00:49.458
-Yes.
-Careful.

00:49.541 --> 00:50.375
Got it.

00:50.458 --> 00:53.416
-Where's the cutlery?
-We bought a ton and you forgot it.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.458
That's okay.

00:54.541 --> 00:55.375
How's it going?

00:55.458 --> 00:58.000
Good.
Let's try this and see how it tastes.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.250
It looks great.

01:01.500 --> 01:02.583
Delicious.

01:02.666 --> 01:05.375
-Is there enough magic in it?
-Let Lina try it.

01:05.458 --> 01:06.291
Okay.

01:10.000 --> 01:10.833
How is it?

01:12.333 --> 01:13.958
-The perfect amount of magic.
-Yeah?

01:15.250 --> 01:16.500
-Lau!
-What?

01:16.583 --> 01:17.416
Want some?

01:17.500 --> 01:19.791
Yes, please. We're super thirsty.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.041
Let's see. Here.

01:21.541 --> 01:22.500
Thanks.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.500
Thanks. Do you like this?

01:32.916 --> 01:34.416
Well…

01:34.500 --> 01:37.166
It's a mix of electronic
and traditional music and stuff.

01:37.666 --> 01:38.541
Can I choose one?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.833
I can add one to the playlist.

01:41.916 --> 01:45.250
Right, he'll "add it."
You'll be 33 before he plays it.

01:45.750 --> 01:49.708
Well, just play something
by Bon Iver, for instance.

01:51.375 --> 01:52.208
Come on…

01:52.291 --> 01:54.041
-No.
-Why not?

01:54.125 --> 01:55.541
That's a downer right now.

01:56.083 --> 01:57.875
Leave this one on.

02:01.875 --> 02:03.416
Everyone's here now!

02:03.500 --> 02:05.291
-Hi, Víctor.
-Hi.

02:05.375 --> 02:06.500
Look who came with me.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.166
How are you?

02:10.041 --> 02:12.416
Clara! I'm so glad you could make it.

02:12.916 --> 02:14.791
-Well…
-I was able to get away.

02:15.375 --> 02:18.041
-It's nice to finally meet you.
-I'm so happy you're here.

02:19.708 --> 02:20.750
Did Nico text?

02:23.875 --> 02:24.708
No.

02:26.125 --> 02:27.333
No, stop.

02:27.416 --> 02:32.333
How about when we lost the keys
to the hotel on the beach?

02:32.416 --> 02:34.375
-Remember?
-I remember that night.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.458
Lina was determined we should sleep
on the roof of that beach bar

02:37.541 --> 02:39.125
or something was going to happen.

02:39.208 --> 02:41.333
On the beach, we would've been robbed.

02:41.416 --> 02:44.291
-You were paranoid.
-I thought we'd break something.

02:44.375 --> 02:47.291
-We were cooler back then, right, girls?
-We were.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.916
-Slipping and sliding on the roof.
-At least we took risks.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.041
Happy birthday to you

02:54.125 --> 02:57.166
Happy birthday to you

02:57.250 --> 03:00.500
Happy birthday, dear Lina…

03:00.583 --> 03:01.458
Everyone!

03:01.541 --> 03:03.750
Happy birthday to you

03:06.625 --> 03:07.583
Thanks.

03:07.666 --> 03:08.958
-Do you like it?
-Yeah.

03:09.458 --> 03:13.041
I saw a bunch of pictures
of you scuba diving, so I added fish.

03:14.333 --> 03:17.416
It's been a long time
since I've dived, but… it's nice.

03:19.708 --> 03:20.708
Blow them out.

03:20.791 --> 03:22.291
-Make a wish!
-A wish.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.666
A wish.

03:25.875 --> 03:27.541
That crushed my heart.

03:27.625 --> 03:28.458
-No.
-Yeah.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.208
But it was cute, right?

03:31.291 --> 03:33.708
It was delicious.
I mean, I had two slices.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.166
-Here.
-Okay.

03:37.458 --> 03:40.000
When I saw Víctor coming,
for a second I thought

03:40.500 --> 03:41.583
he was with Nico.

03:42.416 --> 03:43.250
With Nico?

03:43.333 --> 03:45.166
-You didn't invite him, did you?
-No.

03:46.250 --> 03:49.000
Yeah, I know it doesn't make any sense,
but

03:50.291 --> 03:52.416
I've been thinking about him a lot lately.

03:52.916 --> 03:53.750
And?

03:56.083 --> 03:59.875
I see you guys, and you're a mess,
and you deal with all this shit

03:59.958 --> 04:03.916
and you manage to stay together
despite it all and… I wonder if I…

04:04.000 --> 04:05.500
did everything I could for us.

04:06.750 --> 04:08.708
-Did you bring tissues or are we…?
-Yes.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.708
-Do you still love him?
-Yes, of course.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.666
But I haven't seen him for ages
and I don't know if…

04:19.166 --> 04:20.541
If he feels the same way.

04:21.958 --> 04:22.958
Maybe he doesn't.

04:23.041 --> 04:25.041
How do you feel? What do you want to do?

04:29.083 --> 04:29.958
I want to…

04:30.875 --> 04:32.041
Hon!

04:34.750 --> 04:36.333
You know what you have to do.

04:37.083 --> 04:37.916
Right?

04:40.041 --> 04:41.750
-Okay.
-Yeah, I don't know.

04:41.833 --> 04:44.125
-Just do it.
-You grabbed your tissue, right?

04:44.666 --> 04:45.500
Yes.

04:46.083 --> 04:48.083
-Where are you going?
-Somewhere.

04:49.166 --> 04:50.375
Laura, was this your idea?

04:50.458 --> 04:52.833
You're a nightmare.
Let her do what she wants.

04:55.583 --> 04:56.500
It's going to rain.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.291
Don't worry.

05:10.750 --> 05:11.583
Are you happy?

05:30.208 --> 05:31.583
That must have been the cake.

05:32.416 --> 05:33.250
Shut up.

05:50.708 --> 05:52.833
-You, being the dickhead you are--
-I know.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.250
Wow.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.666
That's nice.

05:57.250 --> 05:59.666
It's been ages since I've seen you…
like this.

06:05.500 --> 06:09.125
-This song! Come on, let's go, let's move.
-Let's dance.

06:12.000 --> 06:13.708
Nico, let's go.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.250
Where's my drink?

06:37.750 --> 06:38.583
Here it is.

06:40.041 --> 06:40.916
Did you drink it?

06:41.791 --> 06:43.041
It was an accident, Lina.

06:44.291 --> 06:46.500
Yeah, right. Do you think I'm stupid?

06:46.583 --> 06:48.833
-I left it there and you drank it.
-You're drunk.

06:49.916 --> 06:53.500
You don't have to take care of me.
That's my job with you.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.125
-What the fuck's going on with you?
-What about you?

06:56.208 --> 06:59.458
Are you pissed I'm having fun
on my damn birthday? Is that it?

06:59.958 --> 07:02.250
Do you want me to be sad all day like you?

07:02.333 --> 07:06.041
I won't talk to you when you're like this.
I'm off. Happy birthday.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.875
No. It's your turn
to listen to my shit, Nico!

07:16.416 --> 07:18.541
I've been listening to yours for months.

07:23.791 --> 07:26.125
That's it. Go home,
lock yourself up in the bedroom

07:26.208 --> 07:28.583
and don't speak
like you've been doing for six months.

07:28.666 --> 07:31.541
Do I have to apologize
for mourning my father?

07:31.625 --> 07:34.833
What about me, Nico?
I'm here by your side!

07:34.916 --> 07:36.958
I've been by your side this whole time.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.625
By my side, but in this state.
Look at yourself.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.625
You've been pushing me away,
tonight and every night.

07:43.166 --> 07:44.500
Because you make me sad.

07:45.541 --> 07:46.458
It's contagious.

07:47.666 --> 07:48.875
You make me feel lonely.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.791
I'm so sorry you feel that way.

07:57.916 --> 07:59.166
They don't come this way.

08:11.333 --> 08:13.083
I don't know how to do this anymore.

08:17.875 --> 08:19.375
I try to make you feel better.

08:20.833 --> 08:21.791
But I can't.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.958
And I'm scared we'll always be like this.

08:39.708 --> 08:41.041
Maybe we're lost.

08:49.833 --> 08:51.333
Hey, this crap is good.

08:52.416 --> 08:53.500
Better than the cake?

08:55.916 --> 08:58.166
-That's why I threw it up.
-Yeah, right.

09:02.666 --> 09:05.500
This is now my official birthday dinner.

09:07.083 --> 09:07.916
Official?

09:26.000 --> 09:27.625
I like how the night ended.

09:34.416 --> 09:35.250
Fair enough.

09:37.875 --> 09:41.041
From now on, we'll have
a sandwich dinner here on your birthday.

09:41.125 --> 09:42.083
Okay, deal.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.208
No matter what.

09:47.000 --> 09:50.166
It'll be like when kids
get lost in a shopping mall.

09:51.041 --> 09:53.375
They have a meeting point
where they go to be found.

09:56.500 --> 09:59.375
If that happens to us… if we get lost…

10:01.916 --> 10:03.583
this can be our meeting point.

10:14.041 --> 10:14.875
I like it.

12:24.750 --> 12:26.958
THIS SERIES IS A WORK OF FICTION.
