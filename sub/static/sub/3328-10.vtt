WEBVTT

00:01.330 --> 00:04.322
Apparently the mayor's gonna
hinge his reelection campaign

00:04.370 --> 00:08.136
on the renewed vigilance when it
comes to quality of life crimes,

00:08.170 --> 00:12.072
so keep it in mind when you're
out there doing real work.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.077
OFFICER:
Captain?

00:13.110 --> 00:14.668
Guy walked in,

00:14.710 --> 00:16.598
said he needs to see
the man In charge.

00:16.650 --> 00:18.277
Are you the lord here?

00:18.310 --> 00:19.413
He keeps saying "lord."

00:19.450 --> 00:20.747
I took it to mean "captain."

00:20.780 --> 00:22.111
Tom Gregson.

00:22.150 --> 00:23.219
Can I help you?

00:23.250 --> 00:25.115
I am the knight.

00:25.150 --> 00:26.754
I was dubbed.

00:26.790 --> 00:28.781
Now I am the knight.

00:28.820 --> 00:31.380
Okay.

00:31.430 --> 00:33.819
That's why I had
to kill the queen.

00:33.860 --> 00:36.090
You killed the queen?

00:36.130 --> 00:37.620
It was my duty.

00:37.670 --> 00:38.659
I had to kill her.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.759
I had to.

00:40.800 --> 00:42.108
Gun
Sir!!

00:42.140 --> 00:43.266
It was my duty.
Hey!

00:43.310 --> 00:44.629
If you pick up that gun,

00:44.670 --> 00:46.501
this is gonna end
fast and ugly.

00:46.540 --> 00:48.235
I'm the knight.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.702
Holmes, stay back,
stay back!

00:49.750 --> 00:51.809
I was dubbed.
Sir, I'm gonna ask you

00:51.850 --> 00:53.715
one more time--
step away from that weapon.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.718
Can I try something?

00:55.750 --> 00:57.308
Try it fast.

01:00.360 --> 01:02.487
The, uh, scarf on your wrist?

01:02.530 --> 01:05.328
On your wrist. It...
(coughing)

01:05.360 --> 01:06.759
It... (coughing)

01:06.800 --> 01:08.290
(clears throat)

01:10.870 --> 01:13.691
(clearing throat)

01:13.740 --> 01:16.402
As I was saying, I noticed
the scarf straightaway.

01:16.440 --> 01:19.500
This is an extremely compelling
story, Mr. Holmes,

01:19.540 --> 01:21.679
but I asked
about the James Dylan case.

01:21.710 --> 01:23.678
The incident you're describing

01:23.710 --> 01:25.769
is connected to the murder
or Rada Hollingsworth.

01:25.810 --> 01:28.347
Which is, in turn,
inextricably linked

01:28.380 --> 01:30.245
to the tale of James Dylan.

01:30.290 --> 01:31.712
If you would just answer
the question I asked you.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.251
I am answering the question,

01:33.290 --> 01:36.327
just more precisely
than you intended me to.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.282
You cannot understand
one InCIdent

01:38.330 --> 01:40.594
without first
understanding the other.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.598
(clears throat, mumbles)

01:47.470 --> 01:49.199
As I was saying...

01:49.240 --> 01:51.868
The scarf on your wrist--

01:51.910 --> 01:54.208
was it a favor
from your lady?

01:54.240 --> 01:57.277
Yes. Belonged
to my queen.

01:57.310 --> 01:58.868
HOLMES:
Then it must be

01:58.910 --> 02:00.571
returned to her.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.815
Knight's Code commands it, yeah?

02:02.850 --> 02:06.479
You give it to me, I'll have
a squire bring it to her.

02:08.220 --> 02:09.824
HOLMES:
Here.

02:09.860 --> 02:11.487
Allow me, sir.

02:13.330 --> 02:14.695
(man grunts)
BELL: Go down.

02:14.730 --> 02:16.197
Down!
MAN:
No!

02:16.230 --> 02:18.164
(whimpering)

02:18.200 --> 02:19.736
(sighs)

02:19.770 --> 02:21.761
Knight's Code?
What is that?

02:21.800 --> 02:24.360
Uh, it's oral tradition.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.833
The man's clearly
schizophrenic, but...

02:26.880 --> 02:29.474
HOLMES:
...his delusions are based on,
uh... on actual history.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.171
In the Middle Ages,

02:31.210 --> 02:33.440
a knight would often wear
a token from their beloved.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.313
Usually an article
of clothing, a scarf.

02:36.350 --> 02:39.387
Any thoughts where the queen
who gave it to him might be?

02:39.420 --> 02:41.354
No, not just yet.

02:41.390 --> 02:42.880
Give the man
a mInute, Will you?

02:42.930 --> 02:45.353
He's a brave and brilliant
Instrument of justice.

02:45.390 --> 02:47.893
All we got to do
is stay out of his way,

02:47.930 --> 02:49.795
and he'll lead us
right to the truth.

02:49.830 --> 02:51.525
MAN:
I got to throw a flag

02:51.570 --> 02:53.197
on the play.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.595
Now, I've known Tommy Gregson

02:55.640 --> 02:57.631
a long time.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.228
I'm guessing he didn't

02:59.280 --> 03:00.770
actually say that.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.903
He may have used different words
to make the same point.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.440
Mr. Holmes,

03:04.480 --> 03:05.742
do me a favor?

03:05.780 --> 03:07.247
Spare us the flourishes.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.384
You're under oath,
and that oath counts.

03:09.420 --> 03:12.480
This is a real hearing
presided over by a real judge.

03:12.520 --> 03:13.885
Of course,
Your Honor.

03:13.920 --> 03:17.651
It is an administrative hearing.

03:17.690 --> 03:21.558
This court represents
neither state nor federal law,

03:21.600 --> 03:23.659
but rather the dictates of the

03:23.700 --> 03:25.395
police department
of New York.

03:25.430 --> 03:29.537
So, "real judge," while not
technically inaccurate,

03:29.570 --> 03:31.435
seems like an overstatement.

03:31.470 --> 03:33.472
JUDGE:
By all means,

03:33.510 --> 03:36.308
let's be 100% accurate.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.309
I do only represent the police
department of New York.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.784
We're here today
because you screwed up.

03:42.820 --> 03:46.256
And the NYPD
has empowered me, as

03:46.290 --> 03:48.918
a technically real judge,

03:48.960 --> 03:52.452
to determine the magnitude
of said screw-up,

03:52.500 --> 03:54.320
and to make a recommendation

03:54.360 --> 03:57.568
as to whether or not
you and your partner can

03:57.600 --> 04:00.592
continue your relationship
with the city.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.665
Now, is that accurate

04:02.710 --> 04:04.462
enough for you?

04:39.880 --> 04:42.804
We're here today because of one
particular breach of protocol.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.738
Alleged breach of protocol.
Alleged

04:44.780 --> 04:47.544
breach of protocol.

04:47.580 --> 04:49.639
I'm curious, though. Would
you say the incident is part

04:49.690 --> 04:51.419
of a larger pattern?

04:51.450 --> 04:53.509
Tommy.
Commissioner.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.349
So how about it,
Mr. Holmes?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.425
Is this all part
of a larger pattern?

05:02.470 --> 05:03.960
I'm sorry.
I don't follow you.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.820
Do you routinely
break the law

05:05.870 --> 05:07.758
during the course
of your investigations?

05:07.800 --> 05:10.030
Ah, not that I recall, no.

05:10.070 --> 05:11.958
So you've never
broken the law?

05:12.010 --> 05:13.875
Everyone breaks the law,
Ms. Walker.

05:15.010 --> 05:16.568
Case in point.

05:16.610 --> 05:17.838
You have been precisely
seven minutes early

05:17.880 --> 05:18.539
for every meeting
we've ever had.

05:18.580 --> 05:19.239
You arrange
your notebooks

05:19.280 --> 05:21.373
exactly the same way each day.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.513
You position a small photograph
of an eleventh-century bust

05:23.550 --> 05:25.745
so that you can look at it
before you begin your work.

05:25.790 --> 05:27.712
Are you suggesting that
someone as bound by routine

05:27.760 --> 05:29.625
such as yourself
has never crossed

05:29.660 --> 05:32.595
against the traffic lights
in order to keep to a schedule?

05:32.630 --> 05:35.349
I'm not talking
about that kind of law-breaking.

05:35.400 --> 05:37.766
So, some degree
of criminality is acceptable,

05:37.800 --> 05:39.062
the rest is just
negotiating boundaries?

05:40.670 --> 05:43.138
Answer the questions directly,
Mr. Holmes.

05:43.170 --> 05:46.139
If you won't do it out
of respect for this institution,

05:46.170 --> 05:47.774
do it for the officer
who's in the hospital

05:47.810 --> 05:49.607
'cause of what happened here.

05:49.650 --> 05:52.869
_ I have never broken the law
In a manner Ms. Walker suggests.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.808
We have statements _from
several officers saying

05:54.850 --> 05:57.148
they have no idea how
you and your partner

05:57.190 --> 05:58.919
get inside of
so many private homes

05:58.950 --> 06:00.781
and businesses
when nobody's there.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.879
They all think
you break in.

06:02.930 --> 06:07.458
So, you didn't pick the lock
on Victor Nardin's apartment?

06:07.500 --> 06:12.392
You didn't break into the
McTierney Brothers Mortuary?

06:12.440 --> 06:13.998
A couple
of our officers even think

06:14.040 --> 06:16.099
you've taught your partner
how to do it.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.404
The officers who told you
those things are confused.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.476
You're saying you didn't
enter those dwellings?

06:20.510 --> 06:24.071
Because you used evidence
from inside those places.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.943
No. Ms. Watson and I entered
those locations,

06:26.980 --> 06:28.413
just not illegally.

06:28.450 --> 06:31.419
I'm not sure I understand.

06:31.450 --> 06:35.557
It was quite some time ago,
but if I remember correctly,

06:35.590 --> 06:37.854
on most of those occasions,
the doors were open.

06:37.890 --> 06:38.822
In New York City?

06:38.860 --> 06:40.623
The front doors were open?

06:40.660 --> 06:42.969
Not just unlocked,
but actually open?

06:43.000 --> 06:46.060
I was surprised, as well.

06:46.100 --> 06:47.590
In several other instances,

06:47.640 --> 06:48.937
we thought
we heard cries for help.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.460
They turned out
to be televisions

06:50.510 --> 06:51.738
with the volume turned up.

06:51.770 --> 06:53.670
So there's an
epidemic of people

06:53.710 --> 06:54.904
leaving their TVs on?

06:54.940 --> 06:56.544
Once we mistook the cries

06:56.580 --> 06:58.571
of a small puppy
for a baby in distress.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.648
Your Honor, allow me
to register my skepticism.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.510
Registered,
but unless

07:04.550 --> 07:07.519
you've got a witness
who can contradict Mr. Holmes'

07:07.560 --> 07:08.913
testimony...
How could she?

07:08.960 --> 07:10.928
Miss Watson and I were
the only ones present.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.723
Oh, I'll be asking
Miss Watson what happened.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.058
Excellent. That should
clear things up.

07:15.100 --> 07:17.796
So, someone walked

07:17.830 --> 07:20.560
into the eleventh precinct
with a shotgun.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.000
This has something to do
with the James Dylan incident...

07:23.040 --> 07:25.565
No, it has everything
to do with it.

07:25.610 --> 07:26.975
Having disarmed
the knight,

07:27.010 --> 07:28.671
we turned our attention

07:28.710 --> 07:31.702
to establishing his identity
and that of the queen.

07:31.750 --> 07:35.140
Does anyone ever call you
anything besides "The Knight"?

07:35.180 --> 07:38.013
It was my duty
to kill the queen.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.014
H was summoned to her lair

07:42.060 --> 07:45.086
and told that only in death

07:45.130 --> 07:47.098
would her soul be saved
from the demons.

07:47.130 --> 07:49.598
Th-This lair--

07:49.630 --> 07:52.121
do you have any idea
where it is?

07:52.170 --> 07:54.695
It was my sworn duty.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.605
WATSON:
This is going nowhere.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.608
He's schizophrenic, in the
middle of a psychotic episode.

07:58.640 --> 08:00.130
It's going to be days

08:00.180 --> 08:02.774
and a lot of risperidone
before he starts making sense.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.244
Not a time frame
that bodes well for the queen,

08:05.280 --> 08:08.613
on the off chance
she is still alive.

08:08.650 --> 08:11.642
Well, there's blood
in the treads of his boots.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.555
Probably hers.

08:13.590 --> 08:15.888
Two receipts, both
for early-morning coffee runs.

08:15.920 --> 08:18.229
One at 6:27 am, one at 6:36,

08:18.260 --> 08:19.693
both from the same bodega

08:19.730 --> 08:21.789
on West 20th
and Fifth Avenue.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.889
Well, maybe he lives
in the Flatiron district.

08:23.930 --> 08:26.865
(phone chimes)
Along with hundreds of thousands
of other people.

08:26.900 --> 08:30.267
Only one of them is
named Silas Cole.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.972
I texted his picture
to a friend of mine

08:33.010 --> 08:35.137
who works the psych
E.R. at Sanbridge.

08:35.180 --> 08:36.545
She recognized him.

08:36.580 --> 08:38.047
SILAS (crying):
I set her free.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.219
Captain, the man's name

08:40.250 --> 08:41.979
is Silas Cole. He lives
in the Flatiron District.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.248
We'll have an address
for you momentarily.

08:43.290 --> 08:44.780
All right.

08:44.820 --> 08:47.653
I'll get a warrant
for his place.

08:50.190 --> 08:53.819
BELL:
This does not fill me
with optimism for the queen.

08:53.860 --> 08:56.328
WATSON:
Well, the figure on the
right is obviously Silas,

08:56.360 --> 08:58.123
which would suggest

08:58.170 --> 09:00.661
the queen is
a real person, as well.

09:00.700 --> 09:03.203
Yeah, but how do we know
for sure that's the queen?

09:03.240 --> 09:05.936
I mean, I don't see any crown.

09:05.970 --> 09:08.074
In the Middle Ages,
only royalty were allowed

09:08.110 --> 09:09.771
to wear purple and ermine.

09:09.810 --> 09:12.870
That is most certainly
Silas's queen.

09:12.920 --> 09:17.345
And he did rather a good
job with the likeness.

09:17.390 --> 09:21.019
Oh. So she was his girlfriend.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.324
BELL:
Seriously?
That guy's in no shape

09:23.360 --> 09:24.952
to be dating anyone.

09:24.990 --> 09:27.652
Well, you don't know
what he was like on his meds.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.053
Silas and his
queen were together

09:29.100 --> 09:31.819
till about six months
ago, I would venture.

09:31.870 --> 09:33.792
These photographs-- all taken
over the last three years.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.091
There are none

09:35.140 --> 09:37.768
from last summer.
Hmm.

09:37.810 --> 09:41.109
Maybe she's the one
who broke up with him.

09:41.140 --> 09:42.368
Okay, look at this necklace.

09:42.410 --> 09:45.072
Maybe he gave it to her
as a gift.

09:45.110 --> 09:47.340
She gave it back to him
when they broke up.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.940
Her name starts
with an "R."

09:49.990 --> 09:52.117
There's a whole stack
of fashion magazines here.

09:52.150 --> 09:54.311
Last year's issue...

09:54.360 --> 09:58.854
Subscription mailing label's
addressed to Rada Hollingsworth.

09:58.890 --> 10:00.255
She lives on 23rd.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.097
WALKER:
So, Detective Bell

10:02.130 --> 10:04.667
was actually the one
who identified Ms. Hollingsworth

10:04.700 --> 10:06.327
as "The Queen."

10:06.370 --> 10:09.134
A substantial contribution
to the case, wouldn't you say?

10:09.170 --> 10:12.936
Yes. One of many he's made
during our work together.

10:12.980 --> 10:17.144
Sounds like you regard him as
a real asset to the department.

10:17.180 --> 10:19.148
Detective Bell is
several standard deviations

10:19.180 --> 10:20.841
above the norm.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.814
I've always regarded him
as such.

10:22.850 --> 10:25.216
Your affection for the man
really shines through.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.286
According

10:27.320 --> 10:28.878
to your deposition,

10:28.920 --> 10:30.751
when you got to
Rada Hollingsworth's apartment,

10:30.790 --> 10:33.099
the door was wide open.

10:33.130 --> 10:35.291
That's correct.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.991
It was.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.327
BELL:
Ms. Hollingsworth?

10:40.900 --> 10:43.209
Ms. Hollingsworth?

10:56.750 --> 10:59.048
In here!

11:06.830 --> 11:09.458
Looks like she's been dead
for a couple hours.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.968
These must be Silas's
boot prints.

11:16.040 --> 11:17.803
BELL:
All right, I'm gonna call
the station.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.467
Tell 'em to book Cole.

11:19.510 --> 11:21.398
Don't.

11:21.440 --> 11:24.705
You know, I'm not convinced that
Silas Cole killed this woman.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.944
WALKER:
Sorry.

11:25.980 --> 11:28.073
Silas Cole walked
into the station

11:28.120 --> 11:30.714
holding a shotgun and confessed.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.957
You were standing there
looking at his footprints,

11:32.990 --> 11:36.289
and your first thought was he
didn't kill Rada Hollingsworth?

11:36.320 --> 11:38.026
Not my first thought.

11:38.060 --> 11:40.392
I tend to have thoughts
in rapid succession.

11:40.430 --> 11:43.968
She'd been shot in the chest,
rib cage. Her heart...

11:44.000 --> 11:46.218
had essentially
been obliterated.

11:46.270 --> 11:49.034
The knight wouldn't do that.

11:49.070 --> 11:50.901
Silas Cole said
he killed her

11:50.940 --> 11:53.101
in order to save her soul.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.506
In the Middle Ages,
the heart was not just a symbol

11:55.540 --> 11:59.909
of romantic love.
It was the vessel for the soul.

11:59.950 --> 12:02.510
So for him to shoot
her in her heart--

12:02.550 --> 12:04.142
in the universe
of his delu5Ions--

12:04.190 --> 12:06.909
he would be sentencing her
to eternal damnation.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.178
He wouldn't do that.
He loved her.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.381
And the confession? The...

12:11.430 --> 12:13.421
footprints?
Silas Cole

12:13.460 --> 12:15.428
was acting
in diminished capacity.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.122
He may well have believed he was
responsible, even if he wasn't.

12:18.170 --> 12:19.523
As to the footprints,
there's no question

12:19.570 --> 12:21.197
that he was in the apartment.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.367
I just don't believe
he pulled the trigger.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.366
Which means, of course,
someone else did.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.399
(door opens)

12:29.040 --> 12:31.144
Your Honor,
Ms. Watson is scheduled

12:31.180 --> 12:32.943
to testify at this hearing.

12:32.980 --> 12:34.447
She can't be here.
WATSON:
Excuse me, Your Honor,

12:34.480 --> 12:35.879
I have an important message
for Captain Gregson.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.012
His phone is off.

12:37.050 --> 12:39.041
_ I would not _
Interrupt otherwrse.

12:41.090 --> 12:42.489
What's going on?

12:42.520 --> 12:44.784
JUDGE:
Mr. Holmes,
while you're

12:44.830 --> 12:46.457
on the stand in my courtroom,

12:46.490 --> 12:47.923
you will limit yourself
to testimony

12:47.960 --> 12:50.019
relevant to
this case.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.197
Do you understand?

12:52.230 --> 12:54.198
Yep.

12:54.240 --> 12:56.800
Thanks for texting, Gretchen.
What happened?

12:56.840 --> 12:59.001
While I was repairing
the abdominal wall,

12:59.040 --> 13:01.338
a blood clot formed
in the left ventricle.

13:01.380 --> 13:03.803
I thought this was supposed
to be routine surgery.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.273
We thought he was out of
the woods a few days ago, too.

13:06.310 --> 13:07.948
There's no such thing
as "routine"

13:07.980 --> 13:09.948
when you're recovering
from a gunshot to the abdomen.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.309
What happened with the clot?

13:11.350 --> 13:13.454
It got wedged in his right
subclavian artery.

13:13.490 --> 13:16.459
Obstructed the blood flow
to his arm for about 30 minutes.

13:16.490 --> 13:18.458
So what's the prognosis?

13:18.490 --> 13:20.196
He might be fine.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.027
Or...?

13:22.060 --> 13:26.167
Or he may never regain
full use of the limb.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.498
He's in recovery.

13:42.120 --> 13:45.044
Tell me again...
why they wait until five days

13:45.090 --> 13:47.183
after he got shot
to perform the operation.

13:47.220 --> 13:49.188
They leave abdominal wounds
open for a while.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.482
It helps reduce infection.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.055
It's absolutely
standard procedure.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.455
The timeline has nothing to do
with the clot.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.967
He was still unconscious
when I left.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.195
They'll know more
once he wakes up.

13:59.230 --> 14:00.458
I'm gonna go back
to the hospital.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.968
You should come
when this is over.

14:03.010 --> 14:06.605
You haven't visited Bell
once Since he was shot.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.269
You asked me to grab you
when we're headed back in.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.972
Thank you for the news.
Hey.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.319
Wide open doors? Puppies?

14:16.350 --> 14:18.238
I'm just saying what I need
to say to get us back to work.

14:18.290 --> 14:20.508
Well, it's not just what you
say. It's how you say it.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.585
You_can hate
what's gomg on in there.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.383
You can think
it's beneath you.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.079
But if the judge knows
that you think that,

14:26.130 --> 14:27.620
how is that good for you?

14:29.430 --> 14:31.227
Be nice.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.296
It's the smart play.

14:52.020 --> 14:54.386
Did you put this
on my desk?

14:54.420 --> 14:57.184
"At the head of all
understanding is realizing

14:57.230 --> 15:00.199
"what is and what cannot be

15:00.230 --> 15:03.996
and the consoling of what is
not in our power to change."

15:04.030 --> 15:06.567
It's a lovely
sentiment.

15:11.210 --> 15:14.031
But you know that
'cause you've got a photograph

15:14.080 --> 15:16.378
of ben Judah's bust
on your day planner.

15:16.410 --> 15:18.674
So?

15:18.710 --> 15:20.268
The saying is thought
to be an early derivation

15:20.320 --> 15:22.311
of the Serenity Prayer,

15:22.350 --> 15:25.046
which is commonly recited by...

15:25.090 --> 15:28.059
recovering alcoholics
and drug addicts.

15:28.090 --> 15:31.389
Is that why you
keep the photograph?

15:31.430 --> 15:33.990
As a gentle reminder
of the prayer?

15:34.030 --> 15:37.261
Is this some kind of threat?

15:37.300 --> 15:39.666
No.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.533
No, there's nothing on earth
that would make me reveal

15:42.570 --> 15:46.006
a secret of that nature.

15:46.040 --> 15:50.147
It's... it's just a-a...
tip of the cap,

15:50.180 --> 15:51.442
you know?

15:51.480 --> 15:55.246
From one obsessive to another.

15:56.780 --> 15:58.486
Just an acknowledgment
that the world we live in

15:58.520 --> 16:01.057
is so often too complicated
for the rules we make

16:01.090 --> 16:03.058
to keep it orderly.

16:04.730 --> 16:07.096
JUDGE:
Ms. Walker,

16:07.130 --> 16:09.428
ready when you are.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.668
You heard about Marcus _Bell's
complications, I take it.

16:18.670 --> 16:20.774
Yes, of course.

16:20.810 --> 16:24.678
I'm told they may have long-term
implications for his career.

16:24.710 --> 16:27.372
In that light, I was wondering
if you feel any regret

16:27.420 --> 16:29.718
about your methods
mm$®%.
This is

16:29.750 --> 16:32.116
a courtroom, Ms. Walker,
not a confessional.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.254
Fair enough.

16:34.290 --> 16:38.056
Let's turn back to the Rada
Hollingsworth investigation.

16:38.090 --> 16:41.196
Yes, well, Captain Gregson did
not agree with my assessment

16:41.230 --> 16:43.266
that Silas Cole was
innocent of her murder,

16:43.300 --> 16:45.598
so Ms. Watson and I explored
other avenues on our own.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.791
Ex-lovers, colleagues, a...

16:47.840 --> 16:50.308
neighbor with designs
on Rada's apartment.

16:50.340 --> 16:52.262
All of those, dead ends.

16:52.310 --> 16:54.699
But in the course
of exploring Rada's life,

16:54.740 --> 16:57.300
we learned that she was seeing
an oncologist

16:57.350 --> 16:59.272
named Dr. Phineas Hobbs.

16:59.310 --> 17:02.541
When had Ms. Hollingsworth
been diagnosed with cancer?

17:02.580 --> 17:04.411
Seven months prior
to her murder.

17:04.450 --> 17:06.782
Dr. Hobbs was administering
a stage one drug trial

17:06.820 --> 17:09.482
which Rada was enrolled in.
HOBBS:
I'm sorry. Rada didn't

17:09.520 --> 17:11.488
say anything to me
about where she planned to go

17:11.530 --> 17:13.555
when she left my office.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.819
We tended to talk mostly
about her diagnosis.

17:16.860 --> 17:18.498
I'm sure you understand.

17:18.530 --> 17:21.090
She was
really responding

17:21.140 --> 17:23.108
to the medication.
It was beautiful to watch.

17:23.140 --> 17:25.108
I thought she might even go
into remission.

17:25.140 --> 17:28.576
But, uh, I guess
her ex-boyfriend

17:28.610 --> 17:31.249
had other ideas.
Rada told you

17:31.280 --> 17:33.419
about her relationship
with Silas?
Yes, she mentioned

17:33.450 --> 17:36.669
that her former boyfriend
was schizophrenic.

17:36.720 --> 17:40.258
She'd, uh, ask me for advice
about it sometimes.

17:40.290 --> 17:42.611
I really
had no idea

17:42.660 --> 17:46.221
how sick the man was
until he showed up here about...

17:46.260 --> 17:48.228
about a week and a half
before she died.

17:48.260 --> 17:49.818
He was ranting.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.624
I thought about pursuing
a committal.

17:52.670 --> 17:55.332
I should have.
Obviously.

17:55.370 --> 17:57.838
Drug trials like yours are
expensive, are they not?

17:57.870 --> 17:59.633
They're rarely
covered by insurance.

17:59.670 --> 18:02.730
Rada Hollingsworth
was a teacher.

18:02.780 --> 18:06.204
Have you any sense as to
how she paid for the study?

18:06.250 --> 18:07.877
I know exactly
how she paid for it.

18:07.920 --> 18:12.118
She cashed in her life insurance
for a Viatical settlement.

18:12.150 --> 18:15.119
A viatical settlement is a
repugnant, predatory arrangement

18:15.160 --> 18:17.628
whereby a terminally ill patient

18:17.660 --> 18:20.128
signs away their future
life insurance payment

18:20.160 --> 18:22.526
in exchange
for a monthly cash advance.

18:22.560 --> 18:25.120
The company or
individual making

18:25.170 --> 18:27.365
those payments is essentially
betting that their client

18:27.400 --> 18:31.530
will die before the payments
surpass the value of the policy.

18:31.570 --> 18:35.506
In Ms. Hollingsworth's case,
the vulture circling overhead

18:35.540 --> 18:39.909
was an employee of a company
called Helping Hands Viaticals.

18:39.950 --> 18:44.148
That man's name was James Dylan.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.647
The equation seems simple
enough. The longer she lived,

18:46.690 --> 18:48.908
the less profit for you.
In fact, according to the terms

18:48.960 --> 18:51.827
of employment of this place,
if she outlives the value

18:51.860 --> 18:53.657
of her life insurance policy,

18:53.700 --> 18:55.691
the money comes out of your
pocket. So it seems like...

18:55.730 --> 18:57.698
you would have incentive
to want her gone.

18:57.730 --> 18:59.789
Yeah, well, that doesn't mean
I killed her.

18:59.830 --> 19:01.889
So where were you
the night she died?
Look,

19:01.940 --> 19:04.500
if you want to talk about this,
we can go somewhere else.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.701
And if you're gonna grill me,
I want a lawyer there.

19:06.740 --> 19:09.504
Right now, we got new leads in
from a nursing home,

19:09.540 --> 19:12.839
and I got to hit the phones.

19:12.880 --> 19:16.543
This place is a miserable warren
of cynicism and despair.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.684
You'd think they'd have
a hard time holding on
to their employees.

19:18.720 --> 19:21.655
And yet the cubicles are full.

19:21.690 --> 19:23.658
Some of your colleagues
even have diplomas on display.

19:23.690 --> 19:26.227
So it seems in this economy,
your employers have no trouble

19:26.260 --> 19:27.420
in attracting the overqualified.

19:27.460 --> 19:29.894
Yeah. So?
So...

19:29.930 --> 19:31.625
I was wondering if they know
that you're a convicted felon

19:31.670 --> 19:33.399
who's spent time in prison.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.965
Who told you that?
WALKER:
Seems like

19:36.000 --> 19:37.706
a fair question.

19:37.740 --> 19:41.301
How did you learn about
Mr. Dylan's criminal record?

19:41.340 --> 19:43.649
When I learned that James Dylan
had sold Rada Hollingsworth

19:43.680 --> 19:46.843
her viatical, I did some cursory
research into his background,

19:46.880 --> 19:50.281
research his employers
had apparently neglected to do.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.742
That's the beauty

19:51.790 --> 19:53.348
of the Internet.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.881
24/7 access to everything
from twerking kittens

19:55.920 --> 19:58.252
to criminal records.

19:58.290 --> 20:01.657
Mr. Dylan stated in a deposition
given from his hospital bed

20:01.700 --> 20:03.998
that you discovered
that information from his phone.

20:04.030 --> 20:05.861
Which you accessed
without a warrant.

20:05.900 --> 20:09.961
Would it surprise you to learn
that James Dylan is lying?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.763
Not necessarily.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.938
But you do tend
to attract people who lie about

20:14.980 --> 20:16.675
your illegal behavior.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.849
DYLAN:
Who told you that?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.974
Why, you did.
That's my phone!

20:22.020 --> 20:23.783
According to your outgoing
calls, you regularly contact

20:23.820 --> 20:25.583
the same_local number
several times a week.

20:25.620 --> 20:26.985
It has a 477 prefix.

20:27.020 --> 20:28.419
That's the same as our precinct.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.779
It's a municipal number.
Yeah,

20:29.820 --> 20:31.458
you stole this.
Your calendar says
you have

20:31.490 --> 20:32.855
a recurring commitment
every Tuesday.

20:32.890 --> 20:34.721
Now, there's no heading
on that appointment,

20:34.760 --> 20:36.625
so my first thought was weekly
Brazilian, but then I noticed

20:36.660 --> 20:38.764
the address of the Tuesday
rendezvous. It's 202 Broadway,

20:38.800 --> 20:40.768
which, as it turns out,
is the office

20:40.800 --> 20:42.631
of the New York State Division
of Parole.

20:42.670 --> 20:43.967
Okay.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.331
(quietly):
Let's take this outside.

20:46.370 --> 20:47.598
On the night

20:47.640 --> 20:49.369
that Rada Hollingsworth
was murdered,

20:49.410 --> 20:51.708
I was having a drink

20:51.750 --> 20:54.571
at Sharkey's on
Gansevoort Street.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.918
And your presence in a bar
is a violation of your parole.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.714
Yeah, I got sent upstate
after a bar fight.

20:59.750 --> 21:02.719
I got out of control and
I broke this guy's legs.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.923
So on the particular night that
you're asking about, okay...

21:05.960 --> 21:08.929
I had had a lousy day at
work. I mean, whatever,

21:08.960 --> 21:11.064
they're all lousy, actually,
but on this particular day,

21:11.100 --> 21:13.489
I just felt like having a
couple of drinks with a friend.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.929
Okay, there's at least a
dozen people who can vouch.

21:15.970 --> 21:18.063
I was nowhere near
Rada Hollingsworth.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.374
We're gonna need names
and numbers.
Okay, fine.

21:20.410 --> 21:22.071
But please, don't tell
my parole officer.

21:22.110 --> 21:24.408
HOLMES:
James Dylan's

21:24.450 --> 21:27.419
associates confirmed
that he had indeed been drinking

21:27.450 --> 21:29.475
at the time
Rada Hollingsworth was killed,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.647
so he was no longer a suspect.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.510
You are aware, of course,

21:33.560 --> 21:35.812
that it's a crime
to steal private property?

21:35.860 --> 21:37.748
I stole no property.

21:37.790 --> 21:40.395
Nor did I call
James Dylan's parole officer.

21:40.430 --> 21:41.795
So,

21:41.830 --> 21:43.764
our investigation was back
to square one.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.097
Usually,
this means a distraction

21:45.130 --> 21:46.859
of some sort is called for.

21:48.070 --> 21:50.561
(sighs)

21:50.610 --> 21:52.100
Interesting.

21:52.140 --> 21:54.404
Hey, you never
came down to eat.

21:54.440 --> 21:56.806
I had extra.

21:58.010 --> 21:59.898
What gives?

21:59.950 --> 22:03.317
Science-- the most potent
distraction of all.

22:05.020 --> 22:07.386
Hey, I've been looking for that.

22:07.420 --> 22:11.049
Um, and what are you trying
to distract yourself from?

22:11.090 --> 22:12.580
Silas Cole said he was summoned

22:12.630 --> 22:14.393
to Rada Hollingsworth's
apartment,

22:14.430 --> 22:16.796
which makes me think that the
actual killer did the summoning.

22:16.830 --> 22:18.127
Indeed, Silas received
a phone call

22:18.170 --> 22:19.728
from a disposable cell phone

22:19.770 --> 22:21.067
at 8:40 pm.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.466
WATSON:
8:40. That doesn't track.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.807
Rada's neighbor thought

22:24.840 --> 22:26.364
she heard a truck
backfiring at 7:35.

22:26.410 --> 22:27.729
That had to be the shotgun blast

22:27.780 --> 22:29.372
that killed her,
so, why would you

22:29.410 --> 22:31.776
kill Rada at 7:35,
then wait over an hour

22:31.810 --> 22:33.619
before calling Silas
to the scene?

22:33.650 --> 22:35.049
Why, indeed.

22:35.080 --> 22:37.878
I've been considering
Rada's autopsy.

22:37.920 --> 22:39.808
Her blood potassium levels
were 22.4.

22:39.850 --> 22:41.488
That's quite high, isn't it?

22:41.520 --> 22:43.624
Not for a body
a few hours postmortem.

22:43.660 --> 22:45.389
After you die, your cells start
leaking potassium

22:45.430 --> 22:46.180
into the bloodstream.

22:46.230 --> 22:46.958
So, the longer
you've been dead,

22:46.990 --> 22:48.526
the higher your
potassium level.

22:48.560 --> 22:50.699
Of course, if
you killed Rada,

22:50.730 --> 22:52.960
then waited an hour
before calling Silas,

22:53.000 --> 22:54.888
it could be because_
you wanted the pota55ium

22:54.940 --> 22:56.168
in her blood to build up.

22:56.200 --> 22:58.031
Mm. And what would be
the purpose of that?

22:58.070 --> 22:59.708
I don't know.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.901
To conceal an already
elevated potassium level?

23:01.940 --> 23:03.669
_ Potassium chloride
is an extremely effective way

23:03.710 --> 23:05.177
of killing someone.

23:05.210 --> 23:07.644
It does the heavy lifting
at most of your state-sanctioned

23:07.680 --> 23:09.170
lethal injections.

23:09.220 --> 23:11.085
It sounds crazy, but it would
explain the time gap.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.111
And it would be easy
enough for us to figure out

23:13.150 --> 23:15.482
if we're right. We just test
the vitreous fluid in her eyes.

23:15.520 --> 23:16.817
It's not subject
to the postmortem

23:16.860 --> 23:18.589
potassium build-up.

23:18.630 --> 23:20.188
HOLMES:
Of course,
it wasn't crazy at all.

23:20.230 --> 23:23.495
The tests confirmed what
Watson and I had suspected.

23:23.530 --> 23:24.963
Rada Hollingsworth was killed

23:25.000 --> 23:28.094
with an_ overdose
of pota55ium chloride.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.608
This discovery exonerated
Silas Cole,

23:30.640 --> 23:32.062
who we had confirmed

23:32.110 --> 23:34.032
was legitimately

23:34.080 --> 23:35.729
delusional.

23:35.780 --> 23:37.805
The murder was clearly
the result of careful planning,

23:37.850 --> 23:41.968
and he was in no fit state to
carry out such methodical work.

23:42.020 --> 23:43.578
You're smiling.

23:43.620 --> 23:45.087
That is the first time

23:45.120 --> 23:47.953
you have been anything
but irritated since we started.

23:47.990 --> 23:50.823
Well, an innocent man was freed.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.657
And what, in your opinion,
does this have to do

23:52.690 --> 23:54.521
with what happened
to Detective Bell?

23:54.560 --> 23:56.858
(sighs)

23:58.030 --> 24:00.021
Whether one believes

24:00.070 --> 24:03.836
that I have occasionally
broken the rules or not,

24:03.870 --> 24:06.566
you cannot evaluate the work
that Watson and I do

24:06.610 --> 24:09.875
without considering the good
that so often comes of it.

24:11.180 --> 24:14.013
Whatever happened later,
it matters

24:14.050 --> 24:16.974
that a mentally ill citizen
is not unjustly imprisoned

24:17.020 --> 24:19.238
at the moment.

24:19.290 --> 24:21.884
It has to matter...
to all of us.

24:23.660 --> 24:25.127
Or we might as well just

24:25.160 --> 24:27.253
dissolve this institution
and start again.

24:27.290 --> 24:29.099
This is just
one instance.

24:29.130 --> 24:31.166
There are many, many others.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.122
All of which, by the way,

24:33.170 --> 24:35.138
my partner and I donate
free of charge

24:35.170 --> 24:37.661
to the city of New York, so...

24:39.140 --> 24:41.233
I hardly think
this proceeding is

24:41.280 --> 24:42.975
the appropriate response
to our work.

24:43.010 --> 24:45.001
And what is
the appropriate response?

24:45.050 --> 24:47.143
"Thank you" would be nice.

24:50.050 --> 24:53.144
I'll make sure
Marcus Bell gets that message.

25:03.930 --> 25:05.625
WATSON:
Well, Bell's stable.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.638
They've decided to keep
him sedated overnight.

25:07.670 --> 25:09.228
Less stress on his system.

25:09.270 --> 25:11.636
And you're making
Yorkshire pudding.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.035
Well spotted, Watson.

25:13.070 --> 25:15.937
Most Americans mistake them
for muffins.

25:15.980 --> 25:18.608
When I was younger, our
governess would enlist my help

25:18.650 --> 25:19.947
in making Yorkshire pudding
for Sunday lunch,

25:19.980 --> 25:22.119
and ever since then,
I've found making them

25:22.150 --> 25:23.686
to have a calming effect.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.915
Yeah, Gregson told me
about the hearing. What...?

25:25.950 --> 25:28.259
I enjoy making
Yorkshire Pudding, Watson.

25:28.290 --> 25:30.019
Not eating it.
It is absolutely revolting.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.927
I could dig you one out
if you'd like to try it.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.951
I'm good, thanks for asking...

25:35.000 --> 25:36.695
after you threw them away.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.823
Oh, you're upset with me.

25:38.870 --> 25:40.929
You know, for a genius,
you can be a real nimrod.

25:40.970 --> 25:42.938
You _know that I have to
testify tomorrow, right?

25:42.970 --> 25:44.562
Which means I get
to lie under oath

25:44.610 --> 25:46.066
about puppies and-and
wide open doors and...

25:46.110 --> 25:47.577
Shouldn't be a problem.
If we stick to our story,

25:47.610 --> 25:48.975
there's nothing they can do.

25:49.010 --> 25:51.001
Well, if you bothered to
come up with a better story,

25:51.050 --> 25:53.006
it wouldn't be so obvious
that we were lying.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.915
You're practically
daring them to fire us.

25:54.950 --> 25:57.612
You think I'm letting my ego pay
too big a role in this affair?

25:57.650 --> 25:59.049
This is not
about your ego.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.580
I know that we color
outside the lines a lot,

26:00.620 --> 26:02.212
but this time, Bell got shot.

26:02.260 --> 26:03.955
Doesn't that give you pause
about how we do our jobs?

26:03.990 --> 26:06.288
No.
Why not?

26:06.330 --> 26:08.651
Why do we get to be
above the rules?

26:08.700 --> 26:10.668
Because our methods work,

26:10.700 --> 26:12.327
and I'm comfortable
that our actions are guided

26:12.370 --> 26:15.794
by a morality which supersedes
any clumsy employee manual.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.660
The danger
with rulebooks, Watson,

26:17.710 --> 26:19.166
is that they offer the illusion

26:19.210 --> 26:21.371
that leading a moral life
is a simple undertaking,

26:21.410 --> 26:23.708
that the world exists
in black and white.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.105
Welcome to the grays.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.248
_WALKER:
Miss Watson,

26:29.280 --> 26:31.248
you and your partner
have often found yourselves

26:31.290 --> 26:32.917
inside of crime scenes

26:32.950 --> 26:35.259
and other places of interest
ahead of the police,

26:35.290 --> 26:37.383
ahead of any kind of warrant.

26:37.420 --> 26:39.229
Would you say
that's a fair assessment?

26:39.260 --> 26:41.353
I'd say it's happened
on occasion.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.391
WALKER:
How?

26:43.430 --> 26:46.263
We've encountered
an unusual number of open doors.

26:46.300 --> 26:47.858
WALKER:
Open doors.

26:47.900 --> 26:49.731
I see.

26:49.770 --> 26:53.103
Did you ever break into a place
to help out a puppy?

26:53.140 --> 26:55.700
Once. Although we didn't realize

26:55.740 --> 26:57.970
it was a puppy
until after we were inside.

26:58.010 --> 26:59.409
WALKER:
And how did you
and your partner

26:59.450 --> 27:02.374
learn about Mr. Dylan's
criminal record?

27:02.420 --> 27:03.944
We looked into his background

27:03.990 --> 27:05.878
while we were waiting
to talk to him.

27:05.920 --> 27:08.150
Neither of you stole
Mr. Dylan's cell phone?

27:08.190 --> 27:10.010
No.

27:10.060 --> 27:12.756
So, you are committed
to the same version of events

27:12.790 --> 27:14.894
as your partner?

27:14.930 --> 27:17.148
No further questions.

27:17.200 --> 27:18.827
Actually, I'd like
to ask a few questions.

27:18.870 --> 27:20.690
JUDGE: _
YOU want to cross-examine

27:20.740 --> 27:22.662
your own partner?
I am within my rights,
Your Honor.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.031
I'm acting as my own counsel.

27:24.070 --> 27:25.833
Yeah. Yeah.

27:25.870 --> 27:28.031
I'll be as brief as
I can, Your Honor.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.672
Um... (clears throat)

27:29.710 --> 27:31.177
After you and
your partner...

27:31.210 --> 27:32.802
Uh, should I refer to myself
as "your partner,"

27:32.850 --> 27:34.442
or should I refer to myself
in the first person?

27:34.480 --> 27:35.913
Doesn't matter.

27:35.950 --> 27:38.180
Great.

27:38.220 --> 27:40.438
After you and your partner freed
Silas Cole,

27:40.490 --> 27:44.051
how did you go about
finding the real killer?

27:44.090 --> 27:46.251
Rada Hollingsworth died
of a potassium overdose.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.350
Potassium chloride is something
that you can get online,

27:49.400 --> 27:52.198
but to use it in the
way that the killer did,

27:52.230 --> 27:54.869
you had to understand the
biochemistry of dying tissue.

27:54.900 --> 27:57.061
That's why the killer waited
over an hour

27:57.100 --> 27:58.806
before calling Silas Cole.

27:58.840 --> 28:00.808
All of that suggested
we were looking for someone

28:00.840 --> 28:02.330
with a medical
background.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.701
Hmm. Rada Hollingsworth--
she was a cancer patient.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.399
She was attended
by a virtual platoon

28:06.450 --> 28:08.418
of medical professionals.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.338
So, are you saying
that they were all suspects?

28:10.380 --> 28:12.109
WATSON:
I'm saying that, when
we started looking,

28:12.150 --> 28:13.811
none of them were.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.010
We didn't have a motive,
so we went to the morgue.

28:16.060 --> 28:18.278
You examined Rada
Hollingsworth's body

28:18.330 --> 28:20.218
_ in an effort to find
an investigative bread crumb.

28:20.260 --> 28:21.727
Yes.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.296
But I should say,

28:23.330 --> 28:27.790
"body" isn't really a
100% accurate way of putting it.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.865
The remains

28:29.900 --> 28:32.733
of Rada Hollingsworth's
internal organs.

28:32.770 --> 28:35.933
Shredded by buckshot.

28:35.980 --> 28:38.369
Then dissected by the ME.

28:38.410 --> 28:41.311
Then diwied up, organ by organ,
into their own bags.

28:41.350 --> 28:43.272
Hmm. This is gonna get messy.

28:43.320 --> 28:45.914
Shall we unpack?

28:48.190 --> 28:50.181
Do you really want me to
describe everything in the bags?

28:50.220 --> 28:53.428
Well, why don't you just skip
to the good bit?

28:53.460 --> 28:55.928
Nothing unusual
with the liver.

28:55.960 --> 28:59.760
Her heart-- pretty much
just a bunch of muscle fiber.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.768
Hmm.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.268
The killer must have put the
shotgun barrel right over it.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.767
Now, do we think that
this was by chance,

29:06.810 --> 29:09.904
or was the obliteration
of the heart intentional?

29:09.940 --> 29:11.976
It seems like overkill,
literally.

29:12.010 --> 29:14.149
I mean, she was already dead
from the potassium.

29:14.180 --> 29:16.410
You'd only destroy the heart

29:16.450 --> 29:18.884
if you were looking
to conceal something about it.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.785
Hmm. And how
would we determine

29:20.820 --> 29:23.015
whether the tissue was
healthy when she died?

29:23.060 --> 29:25.119
Well, that's what
microscopes are for.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.151
Hand me that box of slides.

29:29.230 --> 29:32.290
Rada's cardiac tissue showed
clear Signs

29:32.330 --> 29:33.866
of dilated cardiomyopathy.

29:33.900 --> 29:35.333
Her heart
was enlarged.

29:35.370 --> 29:37.565
She would have started
to feel symptoms

29:37.600 --> 29:39.409
of congestive heart failure.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.034
Could her enlarged heart have
been a result of her cancer?

29:42.080 --> 29:43.399
Not directly.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.476
And everything
in her records looked normal

29:45.510 --> 29:47.205
from a few months previous.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.048
What, then, do you think
caused the change?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.445
WATSON:
Well, it's not
unusual for it

29:51.490 --> 29:52.912
to be a side effect

29:52.950 --> 29:54.212
of certain chemotherapy drugs,

29:54.260 --> 29:55.488
especially more aggressive
treatments.

29:55.520 --> 29:57.158
Treatments such as the ones

29:57.190 --> 29:58.919
Rada was receiving
on the drug trial

29:58.960 --> 30:00.450
run by Dr. Phineas Hobbs?

30:00.490 --> 30:01.923
WATSON:
The drug was in
stage one trials.

30:01.960 --> 30:03.894
Typically, an experimental drug

30:03.930 --> 30:07.195
becomes hugely profitable
once it gets to stage two.

30:07.230 --> 30:09.198
We're talking
millions of dollars

30:09.240 --> 30:11.367
that wouldn't have made it
into Dr. Hobbs' pockets

30:11.410 --> 30:12.900
if anyone learned
about Rada's condition.

30:12.940 --> 30:14.908
So, in other words, there,

30:14.940 --> 30:18.307
buried within that bag of
posthumous slop, you found...

30:18.350 --> 30:20.204
A motive.

30:20.250 --> 30:22.343
I'm sorry. You told me you
had a few follow-up questions.

30:22.380 --> 30:24.086
It sounds like I'm a suspect.

30:24.120 --> 30:26.042
You most assuredly are.

30:26.090 --> 30:29.184
Well, then, uh,
I'm getting a lavwer.

30:29.220 --> 30:31.120
Aah! What the hell
are you domg?
Hurts quite a bit, doesn't it?

30:31.160 --> 30:32.479
I bet you've got a nasty bruise
under there.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.088
That's the thing about shotguns.

30:34.130 --> 30:35.392
If you don't know how
to brace them properly,

30:35.430 --> 30:37.591
the kickback will get you
every time.

30:37.630 --> 30:39.097
I hurt myself playing squash.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.495
Once you dispatched Rada,

30:40.530 --> 30:43.090
it was time_
to put your patsy in play.

30:43.140 --> 30:45.267
Well aware of Silas's delusions,
you telephoned him

30:45.310 --> 30:47.403
to come to the crime scene.
WATSON:
We think you convinced him

30:47.440 --> 30:49.237
he killed Rada.
Then you gave him the gun,

30:49.280 --> 30:50.599
shoved some shotgun shells
in his pocket,

30:50.640 --> 30:52.278
and then sent him on his way.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.278
I'm sure you thought
he'd get gunned down.

30:54.320 --> 30:56.515
Either way, you were covered.
HOLMES: Or at least
you thought you were.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.541
But the shotgun didn't just
kick back into your shoulder.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.217
The trigger caught
your finger, as well.

31:00.250 --> 31:02.252
Opened up a nasty little cut,
didn't it?

31:02.290 --> 31:03.985
BELL:
It's not the kind of thing
you'd notice

31:04.030 --> 31:06.180
in the heat of committing
your very first murder.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.425
But it drew enough blood
that some of it wound up

31:08.460 --> 31:10.257
in the grooves
on the strike plates

31:10.300 --> 31:12.666
of those shells
you put in Silas's pocket.

31:12.700 --> 31:14.167
You wiped the shells
clean of prints.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.667
You're a smart guy.

31:15.700 --> 31:17.395
But those little grooves--
they're hard to get to.

31:17.440 --> 31:20.568
We know the blood didn't come
from Silas or Rada.

31:20.610 --> 31:23.602
This is a warrant
to compel a DNA test from you.

31:23.640 --> 31:26.040
We can run the tests,
wait for the results, or

31:26.080 --> 31:28.378
you can just
start talking now.

31:28.420 --> 31:30.308
WATSON;
Dr. Hobbs confessed.

31:30.350 --> 31:32.113
He's losing his medical license,

31:32.150 --> 31:35.017
and he's going to jail
for a very long time.

31:35.060 --> 31:38.052
Thank you, Doctor...
Thank you, Miss Watson.

31:39.460 --> 31:41.951
A very great pleasure indeed.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.695
WALKER:
Redirect?

31:43.730 --> 31:46.426
Then what happened?

31:46.470 --> 31:47.960
You mean with Dr. Hobbs?

31:48.000 --> 31:49.638
No. I've seen enough
of your mutual

31:49.670 --> 31:52.104
admiration society
for one day.

31:52.140 --> 31:56.429
I'm talking about the reason
we are actually here.

31:56.480 --> 31:59.904
The day you got Phineas Hobbs
to confess to murder.

32:01.150 --> 32:03.471
What happened
when you were leaving work?

32:05.220 --> 32:08.018
We were just heading out
of the station.

32:08.060 --> 32:10.585
I'm not learning fencing
from you, Holmes.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.123
Please stop asking me.
It's not fencing.

32:13.160 --> 32:16.288
It is singlestick.
Well, whatever it is,

32:16.330 --> 32:19.026
I'm sure it's fascinating,
but I'm not interested.

32:19.070 --> 32:21.436
At all. Now, if you want to talk
about real sports,

32:21.470 --> 32:23.062
like basketball...
You couldn't

32:23.100 --> 32:24.658
keep your voice down, huh?

32:24.710 --> 32:27.668
Mr. Dylan, it's business hours.
Shouldn't you be...

32:27.710 --> 32:30.076
trolling a cancer ward looking
for prospective clients?

32:30.110 --> 32:31.998
No, 'cause I don't have
that job anymore.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.403
'Cause somebody overheard you
at work.

32:33.450 --> 32:35.475
They heard you say
that I've been in jail.

32:35.520 --> 32:37.738
They told my boss,
and he fired me.
Well,

32:37.780 --> 32:39.748
_ that would matter less
if you could actually sell...

32:39.790 --> 32:41.610
What's the opposite
of ice to Eskimos?

32:41.660 --> 32:44.288
Give the man a break.
He just lost his job.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.558
Well, perhaps this is
an opportunity for you

32:45.590 --> 32:47.626
to do something
a little less soul-sucking.

32:47.660 --> 32:50.549
No, I won't be doing anything
because my boss

32:50.600 --> 32:52.568
called my PO
and he violated me.

32:52.600 --> 32:54.329
I'm going back to prison.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.588
That's a
regrettable outcome.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.062
Regrettable?

32:58.110 --> 32:59.509
You ruined
my life, man.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.076
You don't get to just walk away.

33:01.110 --> 33:02.577
Gunl
(gunshot)

33:02.610 --> 33:04.669
(gunshots)
(indistinct shouting)

33:09.680 --> 33:11.784
We got two men down:
one officer

33:11.820 --> 33:13.185
and one suspect.

33:13.220 --> 33:15.017
We need an EMT here ASAP.

33:17.320 --> 33:20.187
No further questions.

33:32.340 --> 33:35.309
Well, thank goodness
that's over.

33:35.340 --> 33:38.707
Do you have any sense on
how the judge is leaning?

33:38.750 --> 33:41.674
Guess we'll find out
in the morning.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.439
Yeah.

33:44.490 --> 33:47.516
I'm gonna head over
to see Bell right now.

33:49.190 --> 33:52.523
All right, I'll see you
later at the brownstone.

33:55.600 --> 33:58.091
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

34:02.740 --> 34:03.764
Hey.

34:03.800 --> 34:06.701
Hey.

34:06.740 --> 34:08.833
How's it going?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.030
All right.

34:12.880 --> 34:16.247
I bumped into the
nurse on the way in.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.714
She said that you have
some movement back in your arm.

34:18.750 --> 34:23.289
Yeah, that might be a bit
of an understatement.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.400
(sighs)
They said I, uh...

34:38.440 --> 34:41.273
might get better.

34:43.610 --> 34:46.738
In time, physical therapy can do
wonders with nerve damage.

34:46.780 --> 34:48.771
I've seen it.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.808
The, uh...

34:53.850 --> 34:55.818
the department...

34:55.860 --> 34:58.385
requires detectives
to carry a gun,

34:58.430 --> 35:00.227
SO...

35:00.260 --> 35:03.752
what happens if I can't anymore?

35:12.270 --> 35:14.409
What are his chances
of making a full recovery?

35:14.440 --> 35:16.533
Well, he's young and healthy,
which is good,

35:16.580 --> 35:18.571
but there's no way to tell
how much function he'll regain.

35:21.950 --> 35:24.282
Practicing left-handed
is one way

35:24.320 --> 35:26.345
to show you care
about what happened.

35:26.390 --> 35:28.278
A better one would be
to visit him.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.548
I'm well aware
of your feelings

35:29.590 --> 35:31.478
on the matter,
even if your logic eludes me.

35:31.530 --> 35:33.782
This is not about logic.
It's the right thing to do.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.627
It would be an empty gesture.

35:35.660 --> 35:37.628
Unlike you, I have
no medical insight to offer him.

35:37.660 --> 35:38.922
And I can't imagine
my presence would be anything

35:38.970 --> 35:41.234
more than an invasion
of his privacy.

35:41.270 --> 35:43.761
I don't care if you lie in
court, but do not lie to me.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.665
This is not
about Bell's privacy. This is

35:45.710 --> 35:48.178
about your guilt.
(groans)

35:48.210 --> 35:49.837
Look, you're not directly
responsible for what happened--

35:49.880 --> 35:50.869
that is on James Dylan.

35:50.910 --> 35:51.569
But this time, your
fondness for blowing past

35:51.610 --> 35:53.498
"bureaucratic
gUIdeposts"

35:53.550 --> 35:55.472
got a man you respect shot.

35:55.520 --> 35:57.613
If I went, what would I say?
I've got nothing

35:57.650 --> 36:01.416
to offer the man other
than a few banal bromides.

36:01.460 --> 36:05.248
What makes you think
that's not enough?

36:15.940 --> 36:17.896
JUDGE:
This hearing has left me

36:17.940 --> 36:21.330
no doubt that Sherlock
Holmes is a singular mind,

36:21.380 --> 36:24.440
and the work that he's done
with Joan Watson has been

36:24.480 --> 36:27.347
an asset to
the NYPD. Now,

36:27.380 --> 36:30.269
that an ofﬁcer was wounded
during the course of that work

36:30.320 --> 36:33.448
is a highly regrettable outcome

36:33.490 --> 36:37.483
_but one that occurs
in law enforcement.

36:37.520 --> 36:40.421
Another regrettable outcome
in law enforcement

36:40.460 --> 36:43.497
is when officers decide
that they are

36:43.530 --> 36:45.566
above the rules.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.625
So in spite
of Mr. Holmes'

36:47.670 --> 36:50.935
good intentions, he's
demonstrated amply

36:50.970 --> 36:54.474
that he doesn't care
to control his actions.

36:54.510 --> 36:58.241
As such, my recommendation
to the commissioner

36:58.280 --> 37:02.410
will be that Mr. Holmes
and Ms. Watson be terminated

37:02.450 --> 37:06.216
as consultants
to the NYPD.
(gavelbangs)

37:07.050 --> 37:09.257
(gallery murmuring)

37:37.020 --> 37:38.715
You needn't gloat.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.048
It's unbecoming
of the good work that you did.

37:41.090 --> 37:43.479
I'm not here to spike the ball.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.649
I'm going to a meeting.

37:47.690 --> 37:52.263
Seems like...
maybe you should come with me.

37:54.770 --> 37:58.365
(indistinct sportscast
playing over TV)

37:58.410 --> 38:01.061
COMMISSIONER:
Boy, the Giants
sure do suck this year.

38:01.110 --> 38:02.771
Commissioner.

38:02.810 --> 38:05.347
I'm not watching
the Giants.

38:05.380 --> 38:07.541
I know. Just felt like it needed

38:07.580 --> 38:09.411
to be said.

38:09.450 --> 38:13.546
I wanted to make sure they're
taking good care of you here.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.081
The hearing ended today.
The judge recommended

38:16.120 --> 38:18.953
that I end our arrangement
with Holmes and his partner.

38:18.990 --> 38:21.959
It's just
a recommendation, though.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.366
The decision's mine.

38:24.400 --> 38:26.561
And I'll admit it...

38:26.600 --> 38:29.091
I'm struggling with it.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.769
Captain Gregson
pointed out that...

38:36.810 --> 38:39.973
of impropriety on every case
Holmes worked on.

38:40.010 --> 38:43.776
That's a lot of closed cases_
that could get opened up again.

38:43.820 --> 38:47.381
Clearly, Holmes is a...
loose cannon.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.911
But this time,
a first grade detective

38:49.960 --> 38:52.724
got caught
in his crossfire.

38:52.760 --> 38:56.890
Facing danger from a guy
on your own team...

38:56.930 --> 39:00.627
can I really ask officers
to do that?

39:02.640 --> 39:04.938
Wait, are you...

39:04.970 --> 39:07.609
You're asking me
what you should do?

39:07.640 --> 39:09.005
How could I not?

39:09.040 --> 39:11.679
You've been working with the guy
for a long time,

39:11.710 --> 39:15.669
and... you're the one
who caught a bullet.

39:40.010 --> 39:43.571
I heard your hearing
didn't go too well.

39:43.610 --> 39:45.908
Not well at all.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.711
But the commissioner decided not

39:50.750 --> 39:55.050
to accept the judge's
recommendation to terminate me.

39:55.090 --> 39:57.911
So I'm staying on
as a consultant after all.

39:57.960 --> 40:01.657
With a little, uh,
additional oversight.

40:02.860 --> 40:05.499
Congratulations.

40:05.530 --> 40:08.931
Any idea what changed his mind?

40:14.170 --> 40:16.832
There's much
I should say to you.

40:19.180 --> 40:21.546
Thanks.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.912
For intervening
with James Dylan.

40:25.490 --> 40:29.711
You may very well
have saved my life.

40:32.260 --> 40:34.797
And, uh, I apologize.

40:38.160 --> 40:40.924
I had James Dylan's name
before we went to see him.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.733
I should have done
some proper research

40:42.770 --> 40:44.806
before I helped myself
to his phone.

40:44.840 --> 40:47.638
I should have been more _discreet
when I was attempting

40:47.670 --> 40:49.831
to loosen his tongue.

40:49.880 --> 40:53.043
I could have provoked him less
outside the police station.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.048
I could've...

40:55.080 --> 40:57.241
There's any number of ways
that this could've turned out

40:57.280 --> 40:58.986
other than the way it did.

41:02.160 --> 41:03.980
I hate what happened to you.

41:04.020 --> 41:07.251
And whatever role
I played in it.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.157
That's why I've been avoiding
this visit.

41:14.740 --> 41:17.698
So, the palsy in your hand...

41:17.740 --> 41:19.264
I've done some research.

41:19.310 --> 41:23.178
The clinic with the highest rate
of recovery is in Gstaad.

41:23.210 --> 41:25.178
I've communicated
with the director,

41:25.210 --> 41:28.043
and they would be happy
to take you on straightaway.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.877
But if you'd rather stay
in New York,

41:29.920 --> 41:32.138
their top physician
travels here frequently

41:32.190 --> 41:34.988
and could consult
With local speCIalists.

41:35.020 --> 41:38.626
All at no cost to you,
obviously.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.190
Well, I'll just, uh...

41:43.230 --> 41:45.528
I'll just leave you
with their card.

41:45.570 --> 41:47.993
I feel good
about the doctors here.

41:48.030 --> 41:49.736
These people are at the top
of their field...

41:49.770 --> 41:52.659
Holmes, I don't want
a favor from you.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.071
I'd rather not see you
around here.
