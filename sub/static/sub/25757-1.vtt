better than that, Amazon.</i>

01:11.743 --> 01:13.412
This is why
I'm a dog person.

01:32.898 --> 01:36.132
Give up now, Batgirl.
You're whipped.

01:51.684 --> 01:53.283
That was embarrassing.

01:53.285 --> 01:56.722
Especially because you could
have just flown above the ice.

02:01.393 --> 02:02.595
Huh?

02:03.996 --> 02:06.497
Pollen...
In the eyes.

02:06.499 --> 02:08.399
Super allergy attack.

02:10.901 --> 02:14.640
Oh, sorry.

02:20.546 --> 02:22.780
When did these guys
get so good?

02:22.782 --> 02:24.315
I don't know,
but we're better.

02:24.317 --> 02:26.751
Come on, team. Let's
show 'em what we have.

02:26.753 --> 02:28.855
Formation partner swap.

02:37.897 --> 02:41.365
We're about to ruin
your purr-fect score.

02:41.367 --> 02:43.233
Maybe, if you can hold on.

02:44.303 --> 02:46.939
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:52.244 --> 02:54.880
Me... Ow.

02:55.948 --> 02:57.614
Don't worry about losing, Jess.

02:57.616 --> 02:59.349
We still have
a lot in common.

02:59.351 --> 03:00.952
Like our love
of Opposite Direction.

03:00.954 --> 03:02.752
That's not all
we have in common, Ivy.

03:02.754 --> 03:04.722
I do have a green thumb.

03:04.724 --> 03:06.490
Well, green everything.

03:13.866 --> 03:15.733
Would you look
at that?

03:15.735 --> 03:17.634
Plants really do like
being talked to.

03:17.636 --> 03:19.872
Don't talk! Attack! Attack!

03:25.844 --> 03:29.716
How about you just cool your
heels for a while, Supergirl?

03:32.851 --> 03:35.752
Heels? I prefer
sneakers.

03:35.754 --> 03:38.222
But seriously,
your powers are so cool,

03:38.224 --> 03:39.893
they almost blow me away.

03:53.039 --> 03:56.107
Well, it looks like you
four are still undefeated.

03:56.109 --> 03:57.775
Only by cheating.

03:57.777 --> 03:59.509
They wouldn't have won if they
would have stuck to sparring

03:59.511 --> 04:00.777
with their
original partners.

04:00.779 --> 04:02.412
It's called
strategy, Cheetah.

04:02.414 --> 04:04.514
I'd be happy to loan you some
of my books on the subject.

04:04.516 --> 04:07.785
It might help during the
group sparring matches.

04:07.787 --> 04:09.986
Yeah, thanks,
but no thanks.

04:09.988 --> 04:12.889
There is no fair
in fighting, Cheetah.

04:12.891 --> 04:14.491
You'd best learn
that lesson now

04:14.493 --> 04:17.296
before some super-villain
decides to teach it to you.

04:18.565 --> 04:20.033
Now, shake hands.

04:27.440 --> 04:28.642
Hmph.

04:30.510 --> 04:33.510
Ivy, are we still down for the
Opposite Direction concert?

04:33.512 --> 04:34.748
Of course.

04:35.882 --> 04:37.948
Should we go
after them? Or...

04:37.950 --> 04:39.917
I think they need
a moment.

04:39.919 --> 04:41.451
It was a hard loss.

04:41.453 --> 04:43.354
You all did
an amazing job.

04:43.356 --> 04:44.821
Coach Wildcat
is right.

04:44.823 --> 04:46.724
Wow, they've
really gotten better.

04:46.726 --> 04:48.258
Maybe after
they calm down,

04:48.260 --> 04:50.227
we could take them out
for smoothies or something.

04:50.229 --> 04:51.528
Great idea, Supergirl.

04:51.530 --> 04:52.830
In the meantime,

04:52.832 --> 04:54.198
we're going to
have to start practicing

04:54.200 --> 04:56.133
if we hope to keep
our undefeated title.

04:56.135 --> 04:58.501
Coach Wildcat, can you
reset the sparring room?

04:58.503 --> 05:01.273
Does Principal Waller
look like a drill instructor?

05:02.075 --> 05:03.109
Uh...

05:06.344 --> 05:08.611
Eclipso, again? Ugh!

05:08.613 --> 05:11.448
Take a hint! Ignored.

05:11.450 --> 05:15.451
The only time anyone ever calls
me is to be their sidekick.

05:15.453 --> 05:17.287
I am not a sidekick!

05:17.289 --> 05:19.189
I'm Lena Luthor,

05:19.191 --> 05:22.292
the greatest criminal mind
of my time!

05:29.801 --> 05:31.869
I'm through being
a B-list villain.

05:31.871 --> 05:34.505
It's time to upgrade
my alphabetical standing.

05:34.507 --> 05:38.311
It's time to really show
the world what I've got!

05:38.945 --> 05:40.443
But how?

05:40.445 --> 05:44.549
I know. I pinned some
really great ideas on Villaintrest.

05:44.551 --> 05:47.017
Ooh! Plans to take over
the world!

05:47.019 --> 05:48.719
I'd forgotten about these.

05:48.721 --> 05:50.153
<i>Freeze ray? Boring.</i>

05:50.155 --> 05:52.155
<i>Robot army? Meh.
Already tried that.</i>

05:52.157 --> 05:54.424
<i>Harnessing the power
of the Amethyst from Gemworld?</i>

05:54.426 --> 05:56.094
Done to death.

05:56.096 --> 05:59.463
Ooh! Here's
something that could work.

05:59.465 --> 06:02.165
Yes, yes! This could be big.

06:02.167 --> 06:03.267
Huge even!

06:03.269 --> 06:06.470
If I do this, Eclipso,
Brainiac, my brother,

06:06.472 --> 06:11.309
even those do-gooders at Super Hero
High will cower at my villainous might!

06:11.311 --> 06:12.842
But I can't do it alone.

06:12.844 --> 06:14.378
I need some help.

06:14.380 --> 06:15.813
But where?

06:15.815 --> 06:19.052
Finding good help is
so hard these days.

06:19.952 --> 06:22.820
I need cohorts in crime,
a legion.

06:27.025 --> 06:29.025
What are you smiling at?

06:29.027 --> 06:31.628
Don't you have something to wash or clean?

06:36.435 --> 06:39.736
If I had only gone to Super
Hero High like I wanted to,

06:39.738 --> 06:43.006
I could have made some like-minded
friends that could help me.

06:43.008 --> 06:46.410
Say, that's it! Yes.

06:46.412 --> 06:49.981
That will do nicely.

06:49.983 --> 06:52.417
Big Building Builders? Yeah.

06:52.419 --> 06:55.018
I need something built. How big?

06:55.020 --> 06:58.190
About the size of a school.

07:00.726 --> 07:02.493
Atlantis?

07:02.495 --> 07:04.027
Can you believe it?

07:04.029 --> 07:06.330
Sea horse rides,
plankton farming.

07:06.332 --> 07:07.698
This is
once in a lifetime,

07:07.700 --> 07:09.165
bucket list type stuff!

07:09.167 --> 07:11.001
I just entered
on a whim!

07:11.003 --> 07:12.470
And I never
win anything!

07:12.472 --> 07:15.506
Aside from that lifetime supply
of toe cream.

07:15.508 --> 07:17.243
But really, is that winning?

07:18.844 --> 07:21.044
I don't know if I can do this.

07:21.046 --> 07:22.746
I'm not sure I'm ready.

07:22.748 --> 07:25.982
Why do you think I picked you
to be my vice-principal?

07:25.984 --> 07:29.820
Uh, hyper-intelligence
plus super strength?

07:29.822 --> 07:31.354
Not even close.

07:31.356 --> 07:32.823
It's because you
understand these kids

07:32.825 --> 07:34.792
and you know
how the school works.

07:34.794 --> 07:36.262
You're gonna
be great.

07:37.596 --> 07:39.263
How will I contact you?

07:39.265 --> 07:42.465
You can't. The cell reception
underwater is terrible!

07:42.467 --> 07:44.034
But you'll be fine.

07:44.036 --> 07:46.372
Remember, kids can smell fear
so try to stay strong.

07:49.474 --> 07:51.607
"Principal Grodd."

07:51.609 --> 07:53.076
Hmm.

07:53.078 --> 07:56.014
Maybe a little power
wouldn't be so bad.

07:56.948 --> 07:58.582
Five days of no kids,

07:58.584 --> 08:01.150
no schools and no plots
to take over the world!

08:01.152 --> 08:04.587
Oh, happy day!
Oh, happy day!

08:04.589 --> 08:06.155
Hi, Principal Waller.

08:06.157 --> 08:08.893
Hello, student
I don't recognize

08:08.895 --> 08:11.794
and goodbye!

08:11.796 --> 08:13.999
Enjoy your vacation.

08:16.034 --> 08:18.001
No. Make sure
the ship gets lost

08:18.003 --> 08:21.241
somewhere between Bermuda
and the Mariana Trench.

08:25.710 --> 08:28.277
Principal Waller, I thought...

08:28.279 --> 08:30.381
I was just
testing the chair.

08:30.383 --> 08:32.549
Don't grovel, Grodd.
It's unbecoming.

08:32.551 --> 08:34.216
I've decided the trip
to Atlantis

08:34.217 --> 08:35.619
wouldn't be in the
student'' best interest.

08:35.621 --> 08:37.386
There is still so much
to do around campus.

08:37.389 --> 08:39.623
Is there anything
I can help with?

08:39.625 --> 08:41.193
Yes, there is.

08:41.592 --> 08:42.893
Leave.

08:42.895 --> 08:44.097
Huh?

08:44.697 --> 08:46.198
Today, please.

08:53.573 --> 08:55.174
Step one.

08:56.976 --> 08:58.977
All right, you know
what to do.

09:14.193 --> 09:16.158
Oh, you guys missed it!

09:16.160 --> 09:17.761
Supergirl, Wonder Woman,
Batgirl,

09:17.763 --> 09:20.663
and the new Green Lantern put
the hurt on Cheetah and her gang

09:20.665 --> 09:21.898
during group sparring!

09:21.900 --> 09:23.303
It was intense!

09:24.336 --> 09:26.970
Both groups
lacked discipline.

09:26.972 --> 09:28.538
If I were to participate,

09:28.540 --> 09:29.705
I doubt
anyone would last

09:29.707 --> 09:31.041
more than
a few minutes.

09:31.043 --> 09:32.308
That's a lot of talk
from someone

09:32.310 --> 09:34.945
whose only superpower
is a sword.

09:34.947 --> 09:36.412
A sword?

09:36.414 --> 09:38.215
This is much more
than a sword. It's a...

09:38.217 --> 09:39.082
Sword!

09:39.084 --> 09:41.185
And you, Fly Girl?

09:41.187 --> 09:43.552
You think you'd fare
better against me?

09:43.554 --> 09:45.989
Think? I know.

09:45.991 --> 09:49.627
No one can stop
the bodacious Bumblebee!

09:49.629 --> 09:53.129
Gee! Maybe you two should see
who would win in a competition.

09:53.131 --> 09:56.332
Maybe during a game
of, I don't know...

09:56.334 --> 09:57.200
Hyperfly?

09:57.202 --> 09:59.002
- Deal!
- Deal!

09:59.004 --> 10:02.071
It's almost too easy.

10:02.073 --> 10:04.407
<i>Come see
the blistering Bumblebee</i>

10:04.409 --> 10:07.143
<i>take on
the karate-kicking Katana</i>

10:07.145 --> 10:10.214
in the match to match
all matches!

10:10.216 --> 10:12.986
Only five dollars to watch.

10:37.141 --> 10:39.575
Wow, this is awesome.

10:39.577 --> 10:41.945
How long do these
matches usually last?

10:41.947 --> 10:43.448
Oh, about half an hour.

10:54.626 --> 10:56.292
Huh?

10:56.294 --> 10:58.130
Ooh.

11:06.239 --> 11:09.105
I admit, you are better
than I thought.

11:09.107 --> 11:10.941
Does that mean you concede?

11:10.943 --> 11:12.475
Hardly.

11:12.477 --> 11:14.311
I only thought to give you
the chance to surrender

11:14.313 --> 11:16.279
before I beat you mercilessly.

11:16.281 --> 11:18.681
Bring it on, Can't-ana!

11:20.119 --> 11:22.518
Will you make sure you
lock up when you leave?

11:22.520 --> 11:23.522
Thanks.

11:29.694 --> 11:31.394
Often times,

11:31.396 --> 11:32.830
you'll be in a position
where you'll need to escape

11:32.832 --> 11:36.133
an evil doer's insane
yet inventive death trap.

11:36.135 --> 11:38.301
It takes a sharp mind, patience.

11:38.303 --> 11:39.902
And that's why today,

11:39.904 --> 11:42.138
we're having a lock quiz.

11:42.140 --> 11:43.706
<i>The first person
to pick the lock</i>

11:43.708 --> 11:45.942
<i>with nothing more
than a paper clip passes.</i>

11:45.944 --> 11:47.576
What about the others?

11:47.578 --> 11:48.845
They fail.

11:48.847 --> 11:50.346
That doesn't seem fair.

11:50.348 --> 11:53.216
Fair? Try marching
through the jungles

11:53.218 --> 11:56.853
with 50 pounds of blood,
sweat and tears on your back

11:56.855 --> 11:58.321
while animals and enemies

11:58.323 --> 12:01.859
lie in wait for you
to make one fatal mistake!

12:01.861 --> 12:03.426
Then you can come back to me

12:03.428 --> 12:06.765
and talk about fair!

12:08.000 --> 12:10.635
Professor Oberon,
are you okay?

12:11.736 --> 12:13.639
I'll never be okay.

12:14.740 --> 12:16.209
A word of advice, kids.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.676
Never join a circus.

12:18.678 --> 12:19.877
Never.

12:19.879 --> 12:21.043
Join.

12:21.045 --> 12:22.247
A circus.

12:23.249 --> 12:24.450
Now where was I?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.587
Ready, set, go.

12:32.857 --> 12:35.060
Huh?

12:45.404 --> 12:46.405
Perfect!

12:48.741 --> 12:51.077
Well, it looks like
we have a winner.

12:53.645 --> 12:54.746
Huh?

12:59.619 --> 13:00.917
A skeleton key?

13:00.919 --> 13:04.555
What? No!
That's not mine!

13:04.557 --> 13:09.058
I don't tolerate cheating
in my class, Catwoman.

13:09.060 --> 13:11.762
You think they let
you cheat out there

13:11.764 --> 13:12.765
in the jungle?

13:14.165 --> 13:15.898
But this is
just a quiz.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.301
Same difference.

13:17.303 --> 13:19.335
Report to the principal's office
this instant.

13:19.337 --> 13:20.604
But it wasn't mine!

13:20.606 --> 13:21.606
Mm-mm.

13:24.242 --> 13:25.444
Hmph!

13:29.515 --> 13:32.085
I guess that means
you win, Batgirl.

13:33.452 --> 13:36.085
Let that be a lesson, students.

13:36.087 --> 13:38.922
Cheaters never prosper.

13:45.997 --> 13:48.533
Nothing like a warm shower
to start the day.

14:08.654 --> 14:12.656
So cold. So cold!

14:12.658 --> 14:13.856
Who did this?

14:20.600 --> 14:22.898
Why, yes. You are right, Frost.

14:22.900 --> 14:26.737
Ice cream is the most
important meal of the day.

14:30.909 --> 14:32.343
Frost!

14:34.612 --> 14:37.150
To the principal's office, now!

14:37.749 --> 14:38.750
Huh?

14:43.956 --> 14:45.287
So, Wondy.

14:45.289 --> 14:46.956
I heard you were
made out of mud.

14:46.958 --> 14:49.861
So I'm sure you'll be
fine eating my dust.

14:57.568 --> 15:00.771
Dandruff? Ew!

15:00.773 --> 15:02.942
I guess I need
to switch up my conditioner.

15:04.909 --> 15:07.612
<i>Come around to the starting line!</i>

15:15.888 --> 15:17.720
You better
not have fleas.

15:17.722 --> 15:19.023
Oh!

15:19.025 --> 15:21.858
Sorry.

15:21.860 --> 15:25.061
Oh, good. Something I'm used
to chasing.

15:28.332 --> 15:29.532
<i>On your mark,</i>

15:29.534 --> 15:32.438
<i>get set, go!</i>

15:35.506 --> 15:37.209
Come get me!
Come get me!

15:45.384 --> 15:46.782
My hair! Ow!

15:46.784 --> 15:49.521
Took me long enough.

15:53.324 --> 15:56.159
Yes! Who's the best?

15:56.161 --> 15:58.228
I am. I am.

15:58.230 --> 15:59.629
All right.

15:59.631 --> 16:01.831
Get your gear and head
to the locker room.

16:01.833 --> 16:03.266
Say, um,

16:03.268 --> 16:05.002
what do you think is going
on with Wonder Woman?

16:05.004 --> 16:07.373
I swear, I do not
have fleas.

16:25.823 --> 16:28.358
Wonder Woman,
are you okay?

16:28.360 --> 16:30.494
Maybe she decided
to take up swimming

16:30.496 --> 16:32.662
since she's no good at track.

16:32.664 --> 16:34.531
I don't know
what happened.

16:34.533 --> 16:36.899
My head would
not stop itching.

16:36.901 --> 16:37.902
Sure.

16:44.643 --> 16:46.045
<i>Itching powder?</i>

16:46.946 --> 16:48.411
Oh, come on!

16:48.413 --> 16:50.380
That doesn't seem
like you, Cheetah.

16:50.382 --> 16:52.648
- Because it wasn't.
- Sure.

16:52.650 --> 16:54.553
Tell it to the principal.

16:58.222 --> 16:59.422
You know
what they say,

16:59.424 --> 17:01.894
Cheetahs never prosper.

17:17.342 --> 17:19.242
I don't get it.

17:19.243 --> 17:20.778
There has to be
more to this.

17:20.780 --> 17:23.616
Everyone would
totally recognize me.

17:28.086 --> 17:29.519
Delivery for Supergirl.

17:29.521 --> 17:30.587
I'm Supergirl.

17:30.589 --> 17:32.388
Ah, sure you are.

17:32.390 --> 17:34.390
No, seriously.
Can you get her, please?

17:34.392 --> 17:35.757
But I am Supergirl!

17:35.759 --> 17:37.427
Ma'am, I'm a professional.

17:37.429 --> 17:40.196
Everyone knows Supergirl
doesn't wear glasses.

17:40.198 --> 17:43.399
Huh. Go figure. One second.
I'll get her.

17:43.401 --> 17:45.467
Oh, hi! You have
a delivery for me?

17:45.469 --> 17:47.439
Yeah, Supergirl.
Just sign right here.

18:01.352 --> 18:03.285
"No hard feelings about earlier.

18:03.287 --> 18:05.988
"Your friend, Poison Ivy."

18:05.990 --> 18:09.392
Aw, that is so sweet!

18:09.394 --> 18:10.959
I'm totally going to make her

18:10.961 --> 18:13.362
some of Ma Kent's
famous organic corn ice cream.

18:13.364 --> 18:15.799
She's just the sweetest.

18:19.571 --> 18:21.071
Monster plant!

18:21.073 --> 18:23.109
<i>Monster plant!</i>

18:27.245 --> 18:30.045
It's time for your driver's test, Ms.
Lantern.

18:30.047 --> 18:31.613
I trust you're ready.

18:31.615 --> 18:34.184
I was
born ready.

18:34.186 --> 18:37.454
Isn't it true
humans are born not ready?

18:37.456 --> 18:38.755
That is what my creator...

18:38.757 --> 18:41.457
Figure of speech,
Professor Tornado.

18:41.459 --> 18:43.627
Oh, yes. Of course.

18:43.629 --> 18:46.061
Ha, ha, ha.

18:46.063 --> 18:48.264
So, Ms. Lantern,
it is required

18:48.266 --> 18:50.367
that in order for you
to get your license

18:50.369 --> 18:52.269
you must
have a vehicle.

18:52.271 --> 18:54.370
I do not
see yours here.

18:54.372 --> 18:56.141
Oh, yeah.
Sorry about that.

19:00.344 --> 19:02.779
All right. Seatbelts.

19:02.781 --> 19:04.546
- Safety first.
- Very good.

19:04.548 --> 19:07.585
Now, pull out slowly
and check for traffic.

19:09.153 --> 19:10.522
Supergirl!

19:12.591 --> 19:14.390
Too fast. Too fast!

19:14.392 --> 19:16.562
Sorry, Prof.
My friends need me!

19:25.137 --> 19:27.403
Well, at least
she left the seat.

19:27.405 --> 19:28.972
Oof!

19:28.974 --> 19:30.042
Fail.

19:38.284 --> 19:41.551
Jessica? Aren't you supposed
to be at your driver's test?

19:41.553 --> 19:43.653
Yeah. I think I failed.

19:43.655 --> 19:45.155
Oh, I'm sorry!

19:45.157 --> 19:47.124
It's okay.
On the plus side,

19:47.126 --> 19:48.961
I still have
my pilot's license.

20:03.742 --> 20:05.177
Yield.

20:05.776 --> 20:07.612
Never.

20:15.954 --> 20:17.888
Lucky that thing ain't
the hyperfly ball.

20:17.890 --> 20:20.255
It was only a matter of
time before you lost to me.

20:20.257 --> 20:23.426
Unlikely! I was actually
using my bad arm to play.

20:23.428 --> 20:24.726
If I had used
my good arm...

20:24.728 --> 20:26.196
Ladies!

20:26.198 --> 20:27.265
A little help here!

20:30.869 --> 20:34.907
One, two, ha!
I'm already in the lead.

20:35.373 --> 20:36.574
Lead?

20:39.777 --> 20:41.644
You were in the lead.

20:43.314 --> 20:44.749
Huh? Whoa!

20:50.288 --> 20:51.588
Nice catch!

20:51.590 --> 20:54.659
Thanks. Now,
what about this plant?

20:55.593 --> 20:57.526
Thirty two, thirty three!

20:57.528 --> 21:00.663
Wait, I know! Plants need
water to survive, right?

21:00.665 --> 21:03.601
Right. Oh! I get it.

21:10.342 --> 21:11.776
I think it's working.

21:16.281 --> 21:18.481
Where there's a wilt,
there's a way.

21:18.483 --> 21:20.015
Who did this?

21:20.017 --> 21:23.319
Um, I thought Poison Ivy
was giving me a present,

21:23.321 --> 21:25.090
but instead...

21:27.592 --> 21:29.227
Ivy, huh?

21:32.965 --> 21:33.966
Fifty two!

21:34.667 --> 21:36.131
Fifty two!

21:38.335 --> 21:39.601
Uh, question.

21:39.603 --> 21:40.735
Why am I here?

21:40.737 --> 21:43.106
When are you not here?

21:43.108 --> 21:44.209
Good point.

21:45.274 --> 21:45.775
All of you have been
caught breaching

21:45.777 --> 21:48.444
the Super Hero High
school code of conduct.

21:52.449 --> 21:53.849
Enough.

21:53.851 --> 21:55.251
None of you have
lived up to the potential

21:55.253 --> 21:57.186
we hoped for
when you arrived.

21:57.188 --> 21:58.955
<i>I wonder</i>

21:58.957 --> 22:01.291
if this school isn't for you.

22:01.293 --> 22:02.824
That's not very funny.

22:02.826 --> 22:05.494
Are you kicking
us out?

22:05.496 --> 22:06.763
I'm not sure.

22:06.765 --> 22:08.264
But I suggest
you seriously think

22:08.266 --> 22:11.201
about if this is
the best school for you.

22:11.203 --> 22:13.038
Now, dismissed.

22:20.012 --> 22:23.248
Just another little push
should do the trick.

22:25.217 --> 22:27.449
Cheetah, I was just coming
to tell Principal Waller.

22:27.451 --> 22:28.784
I didn't actually think...

22:28.786 --> 22:31.120
Save it, W.
You've done enough.

22:31.122 --> 22:32.323
Come on, girls!

22:33.658 --> 22:35.124
See you later, Ivy?

22:35.126 --> 22:36.792
Not really feeling
up to it.

22:36.794 --> 22:38.096
Maybe another time.

22:39.863 --> 22:42.165
They look really angry.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.635
You know,
maybe they need a hug.

22:44.637 --> 22:47.136
Little known fact,
I give super hugs.

22:47.138 --> 22:49.039
I'm sure
you do, Supergirl.

22:49.041 --> 22:51.741
But right now, we need to
talk to Waller about this.

22:51.743 --> 22:54.679
Something strange
is going on.

23:02.053 --> 23:03.986
Principal Waller,
are you here?

23:03.988 --> 23:05.521
Yes. Uh...

23:05.523 --> 23:08.891
But I'm looking
for some very important files.

23:08.893 --> 23:10.792
What do you want?

23:10.794 --> 23:14.598
We just saw Cheetah, Frost, Poison Ivy
and Catwoman coming from your office.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.432
And Harley.

23:16.434 --> 23:18.334
Yeah, not so weird.

23:18.336 --> 23:20.404
All the stuff
that's happened today,

23:20.406 --> 23:22.004
it's not really like them.

23:22.006 --> 23:24.005
We think something else
is going on.

23:24.007 --> 23:26.475
<i>I understand
your concern.</i>

23:26.477 --> 23:28.578
Come on, work!

23:28.580 --> 23:30.213
But I think we've been indulging

23:30.215 --> 23:33.449
the fantasy that they are
Super Hero High material

23:33.451 --> 23:35.984
for far too long.

23:35.986 --> 23:37.753
Ah, there we go.

23:39.690 --> 23:41.323
That's a... Um...

23:41.325 --> 23:44.195
Unique hairstyle
you have there.

23:45.396 --> 23:48.898
Oh! Uh, I'm just trying
something different.

23:48.900 --> 23:51.400
Listen, I'd suggest
you girls keep being

23:51.402 --> 23:54.369
the do-gooders
that you always are,

23:54.371 --> 23:57.740
and let me worry about the less than
desirable members of our community.

24:00.211 --> 24:02.410
They aren't less desirable,

24:02.412 --> 24:04.380
they're our friends.

24:04.382 --> 24:06.948
If you believe that, I don't think
you really knew them at all.

24:06.950 --> 24:09.153
Now, if you'll excuse me...

24:15.994 --> 24:17.929
Close one.

24:18.963 --> 24:21.363
Was that weird
for anyone else?

24:21.365 --> 24:23.832
I don't know. I kinda thought
her hair looked nice.

24:23.834 --> 24:25.702
No, I meant
the conversation.

24:25.704 --> 24:28.337
You don't think she was right
about the other girls, do you?

24:28.339 --> 24:31.840
No. I believe they're just
as good as you or me.

24:31.842 --> 24:33.208
Let's go find them
and let them know

24:33.210 --> 24:35.313
we stand behind them
no matter what.

24:38.617 --> 24:41.117
<i>I can't believe they thought
I'd do something like that.</i>

24:41.119 --> 24:42.718
I mean, freezing
the pipes?

24:42.720 --> 24:44.553
That's so third grade.

24:44.555 --> 24:46.488
You gotta admit,

24:46.490 --> 24:48.090
it was pretty hysterical!

24:48.092 --> 24:50.760
And itching powder!
Who does that?

24:50.762 --> 24:52.227
I know!

24:52.229 --> 24:54.196
Usually a good pepper
spray would work.

24:54.198 --> 24:57.533
Honestly, they don't make itching
powder they way they used to.

24:57.535 --> 25:00.069
And to think I need
help opening a lock.

25:00.071 --> 25:02.938
Or I'd sent a plant
to attack a classmate.

25:02.940 --> 25:05.340
Or that I'd fill the pool
with custard!

25:05.342 --> 25:08.278
Oh, never mind.
I totally did that.

25:08.280 --> 25:09.846
<i>You know what I think?</i>

25:09.848 --> 25:11.615
I think it was
those popular girls.

25:11.617 --> 25:15.752
You know, Supergirl,
Batgirl, Wonder Woman.

25:15.754 --> 25:17.887
- No, there's no way.
- She's probably right.

25:17.889 --> 25:19.722
I don't like 'em but I don't
think they'd do that.

25:19.724 --> 25:20.790
<i>Think about it.</i>

25:20.792 --> 25:23.158
<i>You five are
the up-and-comers.</i>

25:23.160 --> 25:24.694
Who has more to lose

25:24.696 --> 25:27.062
when you start beating them
at their best drills?

25:27.064 --> 25:30.064
<i>We all know they're
super competitive.</i>

25:30.066 --> 25:32.068
I even heard they cheated

25:32.070 --> 25:34.670
during a group sparring match
you guys had together.

25:34.672 --> 25:35.937
We were winning.

25:35.939 --> 25:37.940
I haven't seen you
around here.

25:37.942 --> 25:39.876
What did you say
your name was?

25:39.878 --> 25:43.379
Divide. I was new here.

25:43.381 --> 25:44.714
- Was?
- Yeah.

25:44.716 --> 25:47.884
It's obvious that this place
is for losers.

25:47.886 --> 25:50.719
Yeah, for losers.
Ha! Wait.

25:50.721 --> 25:53.488
If you aren't going
to Super Hero High,

25:53.490 --> 25:55.057
where are you going?

25:55.059 --> 25:56.157
Haven't you heard?

25:56.159 --> 25:58.561
There's a new school
in town.

25:58.563 --> 26:00.029
Uber High.

26:00.031 --> 26:02.430
Uber High?
Never heard of it.

26:02.432 --> 26:03.499
At Uber High,

26:03.501 --> 26:06.235
they're all about
letting you be you.

26:06.237 --> 26:08.370
Less homework,
more fun.

26:08.372 --> 26:10.005
I like
the sound of that.

26:10.007 --> 26:12.141
Yeah, but what
about our friends?

26:12.143 --> 26:14.776
What about them?
As far as I'm concerned,

26:14.778 --> 26:17.312
you four are the only
friends I'll ever need.

26:17.314 --> 26:19.014
Well, what are
you waiting for?

26:19.016 --> 26:21.885
I think it's time you saw
you were missing.

26:21.887 --> 26:24.353
Perfect! Let's go!

26:24.355 --> 26:25.620
Then I laughed so hard

26:25.622 --> 26:27.356
I spit out a hairball.

26:27.358 --> 26:28.657
Literally.

26:28.659 --> 26:29.826
Where are you guys going?

26:29.828 --> 26:31.292
Like you care.

26:31.294 --> 26:33.295
Yeah. We know what
you four are doing.

26:33.297 --> 26:35.731
And we don't have to
stay here and take it.

26:35.733 --> 26:37.433
You tell 'em, Frosty!

26:37.435 --> 26:39.735
Doing? We aren't
doing anything.

26:39.737 --> 26:41.503
In fact, we were
just coming to see

26:41.505 --> 26:43.974
if there was anything
we could do to help.

26:43.976 --> 26:45.574
I know something you can do.

26:45.576 --> 26:48.610
What? We're your friends.
We'll do anything.

26:48.612 --> 26:51.482
Good. Stay out of our way.

26:58.790 --> 27:01.557
Uber High? Hmm.

27:01.559 --> 27:03.024
Something smells funny.

27:03.026 --> 27:05.660
And I intend to find out
what it is.

27:06.698 --> 27:09.532
Ah, huh?

27:09.534 --> 27:13.205
What? It's good for you.

27:20.978 --> 27:22.678
<i>There.</i>

27:22.680 --> 27:24.981
<i>Uber High actually didn't
exist until yesterday.</i>

27:24.983 --> 27:27.884
The same day everything
started getting weird.

27:27.886 --> 27:29.252
It looks like
it was funded

27:29.254 --> 27:31.286
through several
dummy corporations.

27:31.288 --> 27:33.022
Can you find
the original source?

27:33.024 --> 27:35.360
I'm Batgirl.
I can find anything.

27:36.460 --> 27:37.926
<i>Bingo.</i>

27:37.928 --> 27:39.195
<i>LexCorp!</i>

27:39.197 --> 27:40.996
Lena's behind this?

27:40.998 --> 27:43.265
What does she have
against Super Hero High?

27:43.267 --> 27:44.500
She still holds a grudge

27:44.502 --> 27:46.435
after not being allowed
to attend here.

27:46.437 --> 27:49.405
So, what? She's getting back
at them by stealing students?

27:49.407 --> 27:51.573
Hmm, maybe.
But I doubt it.

27:51.575 --> 27:53.176
Lena never thinks small.

27:53.178 --> 27:54.475
The only way we're
going to find out

27:54.477 --> 27:56.311
what's going on
inside that school

27:56.313 --> 27:58.080
is to go
to the school ourselves.

27:58.082 --> 28:01.884
But how? They know we'd never
leave Super Hero High.

28:01.886 --> 28:03.785
Hmm, we need
someone new.

28:03.787 --> 28:06.021
Someone that hasn't
been here long.

28:06.023 --> 28:07.726
Someone...

28:17.968 --> 28:20.668
<i>This isn't
creepy at all.</i>

28:20.670 --> 28:22.205
Can you guys hear me?

28:22.207 --> 28:23.371
<i>We hear you
loud and clear, Green Lantern.</i>

28:23.373 --> 28:24.807
<i>With the com link in your ear</i>

28:24.809 --> 28:26.574
<i>and the new Batgirl
uplink contacts,</i>

28:26.576 --> 28:27.810
you're 555.

28:27.812 --> 28:29.378
She's 25?

28:29.380 --> 28:31.480
I didn't realize
she was that old.

28:31.482 --> 28:33.515
Green Lantern,
you look great.

28:33.517 --> 28:36.084
It's an expression.
It means she's perfect.

28:36.086 --> 28:38.920
Aw, that's so sweet
of you to say.

28:38.922 --> 28:40.124
<i>Thanks, Batgirl.</i>

28:42.092 --> 28:44.059
Don't be afraid.

28:50.468 --> 28:53.301
Green Lantern, you came!

28:53.303 --> 28:54.837
Whoa!

28:54.839 --> 28:58.107
Well, well, isn't it
the newest Green Lantern.

28:58.109 --> 29:00.208
What brings you
to our new school?

29:00.210 --> 29:02.177
Maybe she's tired
of being, like, what,

29:02.179 --> 29:05.048
the tenth Green Lantern
at Super Hero High?

29:05.050 --> 29:06.682
Second. Sheesh.

29:06.684 --> 29:09.551
So, what is it, GL?
Why are you here?

29:09.553 --> 29:11.052
Uh...

29:11.054 --> 29:12.655
Stay calm.

29:12.657 --> 29:14.122
Just tell them you thought
that they were right,

29:14.124 --> 29:15.558
and they weren't
getting a fair shot.

29:15.560 --> 29:18.494
Um, I just think
you guys were right.

29:18.496 --> 29:21.362
Those other girls just think
they're so cool,

29:21.364 --> 29:22.799
always doing better
than everyone else,

29:22.801 --> 29:25.334
and... Have you seen
Wonder Woman's hair?

29:25.336 --> 29:27.538
- Dandruff!
- Totally true.

29:28.005 --> 29:29.571
Hey!

29:29.573 --> 29:31.807
I just want to be somewhere
I can figure out

29:31.809 --> 29:33.443
who I'm supposed to be

29:33.445 --> 29:36.044
without the pressure
of those other girls.

29:36.046 --> 29:38.549
Well, then, welcome home.

29:39.383 --> 29:40.449
Thanks!

29:40.451 --> 29:42.819
Well, isn't this lovely.

29:42.821 --> 29:45.187
- Who's that?
- Principal Taller.

29:45.189 --> 29:46.955
She's the headmistress here,

29:46.957 --> 29:48.291
and loads more fun

29:48.293 --> 29:51.025
than that stick in the mud
at Super Hero High.

29:51.027 --> 29:52.261
A new recruit?

29:52.263 --> 29:54.530
Yes. I...
I'm Green Lantern.

29:54.532 --> 29:57.199
I just couldn't stand it
at the other school.

29:57.201 --> 29:58.868
I hope it's okay
if I came over?

29:58.870 --> 30:01.103
Of course, my dear.
The more the merrier.

30:01.105 --> 30:04.240
Let me introduce you to our foreign
exchange student, Backlash.

30:04.242 --> 30:06.478
Backlash, this is
Green Lantern.

30:08.880 --> 30:10.478
She looks
really familiar.

30:10.480 --> 30:13.084
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.
- You too.

30:13.684 --> 30:15.251
Ow!

30:15.253 --> 30:16.785
Quite a grip
you have there.

30:16.787 --> 30:19.091
<i>Oh, sorry. I learned it
in weightlifting.</i>

30:22.493 --> 30:25.762
Lashina! That's why
she looked familiar.

30:25.764 --> 30:27.730
Lashina, really?

30:27.732 --> 30:31.067
Wow! She should totally wear her
hair like that all the time.

30:31.069 --> 30:32.635
It looks really great.

30:32.637 --> 30:33.735
It really does.

30:33.737 --> 30:35.303
Really frames her face.

30:35.305 --> 30:37.106
Well, nice to meet you.

30:37.108 --> 30:38.774
Well, Green Lantern,

30:38.776 --> 30:41.644
you've arrived just in time
for your first assignment.

30:41.646 --> 30:44.746
Here at Uber High, we tend to
do things a bit differently.

30:44.748 --> 30:48.217
We're more of a hands-on school,
learning through doing.

30:48.219 --> 30:49.819
And our first exercise involves

30:49.821 --> 30:52.554
helping the good people
at Project Cadmus.

30:52.556 --> 30:54.490
Cadmus has asked us
to do them a favor

30:54.492 --> 30:56.525
and test their security.

30:56.527 --> 31:00.530
<i>Our task is to infiltrate the
compound and find this object.</i>

31:00.532 --> 31:01.897
If we're able
to obtain the object

31:01.899 --> 31:03.866
and return to base
without being stopped,

31:03.868 --> 31:05.167
you'll have passed.

31:05.169 --> 31:06.368
<i>And you'll know
that you have the skills</i>

31:06.370 --> 31:08.571
<i>to beat
the world's best security.</i>

31:08.573 --> 31:11.206
So, who's ready
for a field trip?

31:12.776 --> 31:15.811
Good. Your transportation is
waiting outside.

31:15.813 --> 31:17.446
Good hunting.

31:17.448 --> 31:20.049
Finally, a chance to show
what we can really do.

31:20.051 --> 31:21.817
Especially without
those good two shoes

31:21.819 --> 31:23.484
next door
getting in the way.

31:23.486 --> 31:25.487
All right, the bus is
waiting. Let's go!

31:25.489 --> 31:27.322
I'm assuming you three will be there

31:27.324 --> 31:28.791
to stop this, right?

31:28.793 --> 31:30.292
<i>Don't worry,
Green Lantern,</i>

31:30.294 --> 31:31.662
<i>you can count on us.</i>

31:33.831 --> 31:36.965
Fools! By the time
these girls figure out

31:36.967 --> 31:40.436
I'm using them to steal
ancient alien technology,

31:40.438 --> 31:42.670
it will be too late for them

31:42.672 --> 31:46.675
and the world.

31:46.677 --> 31:49.110
Principal Taller is
totally using our friends

31:49.112 --> 31:51.045
to try and steal
that vase!

31:51.047 --> 31:52.548
Yes, but why?

31:52.550 --> 31:54.753
Maybe for an evil bouquet
of flowers?

31:56.152 --> 31:57.587
We need to confront them.

31:57.589 --> 31:59.353
They're our friends,
they'll listen.

31:59.355 --> 32:00.889
And tell them what?

32:00.891 --> 32:03.326
That their new school isn't
for super heroes,

32:03.328 --> 32:05.263
it's for supervillains.

32:07.198 --> 32:09.698
Magic is about give and take.

32:09.700 --> 32:12.334
It's about seeing
that which is invisible

32:12.336 --> 32:13.769
with the visible.

32:13.771 --> 32:16.571
It's also about staying awake
in class.

32:17.975 --> 32:19.274
I'll fight you!

32:20.678 --> 32:22.011
<i>Remember
to read chapter 33</i>

32:22.013 --> 32:23.446
<i>on the benefits
of toadstools</i>

32:23.448 --> 32:25.749
in potions
and salads. Dismissed.

32:26.751 --> 32:28.717
<i>Except for you two.</i>

32:28.719 --> 32:31.222
You both slept
in class today and...

32:32.223 --> 32:33.889
We slept through
our midterm?

32:33.891 --> 32:35.124
No! That means...

32:35.126 --> 32:36.458
We're failing!

32:36.460 --> 32:38.927
I've never failed
at anything in my life.

32:38.929 --> 32:39.994
Professor Fate!

32:39.996 --> 32:41.530
Professor? Pssht.

32:41.532 --> 32:43.398
I didn't go through
four years of magic school

32:43.400 --> 32:44.800
to be called a professor.

32:44.802 --> 32:47.770
Not to mention the debt
I'm carrying. Oi!

32:47.772 --> 32:49.272
Please.

32:49.274 --> 32:51.173
Call me Doctor.

32:51.175 --> 32:54.642
Doctor Fate, there has to be
something we can do to make this up.

32:54.644 --> 32:56.811
As much as I hate
to agree with Bumblebee,

32:56.813 --> 32:59.417
she's right.
We'll do anything!

33:00.083 --> 33:01.285
Hmm.

33:02.754 --> 33:05.087
I see your problem
is not sleep

33:05.089 --> 33:06.621
but something else.

33:06.623 --> 33:10.024
Yes. I will help you
help yourself.

33:10.026 --> 33:11.260
Follow me.

33:11.262 --> 33:12.427
Did you understand
any of that?

33:12.429 --> 33:13.797
Not a word.

33:16.132 --> 33:20.168
Behold, your extra credit.

33:20.170 --> 33:21.603
A globe?

33:21.605 --> 33:23.338
Not just a globe,

33:23.340 --> 33:26.007
but the Globe of Fate.

33:29.179 --> 33:31.580
What does the Globe
of Fate do?

33:31.582 --> 33:33.851
Place your hands
on the globe.

33:41.159 --> 33:42.457
It looks like...

33:42.459 --> 33:43.693
A necklace!

33:43.695 --> 33:46.428
Yes, the necklace of Wotan.

33:46.430 --> 33:48.630
It has been lost for centuries.

33:48.632 --> 33:51.967
I sense this item will not only
help you pass your class,

33:51.969 --> 33:56.304
but it will also help the school
in its time of greatest need.

33:56.306 --> 33:57.506
Dramatic much?

33:57.508 --> 33:59.308
So, how are we
supposed to find it?

33:59.310 --> 34:01.646
The globe will show you.

34:06.150 --> 34:07.349
No problem.

34:07.351 --> 34:09.150
I'll be there
and back in no time.

34:09.152 --> 34:10.553
You'll be there?

34:10.554 --> 34:11.754
I'll be there first
and bring it back

34:11.755 --> 34:13.621
before you even
get close.

34:13.623 --> 34:15.427
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

34:16.592 --> 34:19.996
I may
have to rethink tenure.

34:31.440 --> 34:32.940
Yes, yes, very good.

34:32.943 --> 34:35.244
Assemble a team
and bring it back to me.

34:35.246 --> 34:37.545
It must be powerful
if Fate wants it,

34:37.547 --> 34:39.580
which means
I need it first.

34:40.949 --> 34:42.516
Oh, nothing.
We're on a field trip.

34:44.222 --> 34:46.120
Yeah. I mean,
it's going okay.

34:46.121 --> 34:47.455
I appreciate you asking.

34:48.891 --> 34:51.860
Salmon, maybe
with some asparagus.

34:51.862 --> 34:54.527
Well, you don't get
where I am by eating poorly.

34:54.530 --> 34:56.630
Too funny.

34:56.632 --> 34:57.999
We're here!

35:08.111 --> 35:09.276
All right, ladies!

35:09.278 --> 35:10.579
The clock is ticking.

35:10.581 --> 35:12.015
Show us what you've got.

35:13.349 --> 35:14.552
Ivy.

35:25.128 --> 35:26.130
I'll check the perimeter.

35:31.302 --> 35:33.369
- Uh, hey, Jack.
- Hey, Al. How's it going?

35:33.371 --> 35:36.305
Uh, my daughter's got
this song stuck in my head.

35:36.307 --> 35:37.939
Oh, yeah, which one?

35:37.941 --> 35:39.475
Ugh, you know.

35:39.477 --> 35:42.512
<i>♪ Get your cape on
And let's take flight</i>

35:42.514 --> 35:43.646
<i>♪ You can do... ♪</i>

35:43.648 --> 35:45.682
Oh, yeah.
I hate that song!

35:55.258 --> 35:56.624
Perimeter clear of weeds.

35:56.626 --> 35:58.095
Good. Come on.

36:03.133 --> 36:04.633
So, can you do it?

36:04.635 --> 36:07.439
Please! I'm Catwoman.

36:12.443 --> 36:14.876
After you.

36:14.878 --> 36:16.647
Where are you guys?

36:21.151 --> 36:23.385
Whoa! This place is bigger

36:23.387 --> 36:25.521
than Giganta's closet.

36:25.523 --> 36:27.789
How are we going
to find this thing?

36:27.791 --> 36:31.059
Split up. Harley, Frost,
you take that row.

36:31.061 --> 36:33.262
Ivy, Catwoman,
take that one.

36:33.264 --> 36:36.798
Green Lantern, Backlash
and I will take the last one.

36:36.800 --> 36:40.035
And ladies, they never said
we have to be gentle.

36:40.037 --> 36:42.905
Ooh! I was hoping
you'd say that.

36:49.146 --> 36:50.778
Nope. Not here.

36:51.849 --> 36:52.981
<i>Here neither!</i>

36:52.983 --> 36:55.219
This is going
to take forever.

36:58.889 --> 37:02.691
Ooh, look who decided
to crash the party.

37:02.693 --> 37:04.425
This isn't
a party, Harley.

37:04.427 --> 37:07.662
You are being used by your
new school to commit crimes!

37:07.664 --> 37:10.432
Sounds like Supergirl's
a little bit jealous

37:10.434 --> 37:12.667
that Cadmus asked us
to help them

37:12.669 --> 37:14.135
and not her.

37:14.137 --> 37:15.704
I think
you're right, Harley.

37:15.706 --> 37:18.305
And what do we do
to the jealous types?

37:18.307 --> 37:19.374
Smash 'em!

37:19.376 --> 37:20.809
Harley, I'm bulletproof.

37:20.811 --> 37:23.178
What's a mallet
going to do?

37:23.180 --> 37:24.582
Distract you.

37:26.584 --> 37:28.483
Oh, would you
look at that?

37:28.485 --> 37:32.656
Beating on Supergirl's totally
gonna save us a ton of time!

37:35.258 --> 37:37.091
This is kitty-tastic.

37:37.093 --> 37:40.195
When was the last time Super Hero
High let us out of our cage?

37:41.532 --> 37:43.398
You're going to spend
a lot of time in a cage

37:43.400 --> 37:45.233
if you don't stop
what you're doing.

37:45.235 --> 37:47.702
Well, isn't it
the Doll Knight

37:47.704 --> 37:49.204
come to ruin our fun.

37:49.206 --> 37:51.640
Don't you have classes
you're supposed to be in?

37:51.642 --> 37:54.142
Principal Waller frowns
on truancy.

37:54.144 --> 37:56.812
And the police frown
on breaking and entering

37:56.814 --> 37:58.914
which you're doing right now.

37:58.916 --> 38:01.350
I know
breaking and entering.

38:01.352 --> 38:02.617
And for that
to happen

38:02.619 --> 38:04.119
we'd have to
not be invited.

38:04.121 --> 38:06.687
But we are,
and you're in our way.

38:06.689 --> 38:08.256
No! You're being used!

38:08.258 --> 38:10.526
It's actually Lena
who's behind this!

38:10.528 --> 38:11.829
Out of the way, Batgirl.

38:24.675 --> 38:25.876
Nope!

38:27.477 --> 38:29.111
Anything yet?

38:29.113 --> 38:30.479
<i>The only thing
you're going to find</i>

38:30.481 --> 38:31.646
in those boxes is
trouble, Cheetah.

38:31.648 --> 38:32.881
<i>Wonder woman!</i>

38:32.883 --> 38:34.283
Come to try
and bring us back

38:34.285 --> 38:36.285
so you have someone
to play second fiddle?

38:36.287 --> 38:38.419
Second fiddle is actually an
important part of an orchestra.

38:38.421 --> 38:40.988
But, no! That's not
what I'm doing.

38:40.990 --> 38:42.591
Lena Luthor is using you,

38:42.593 --> 38:44.559
all of you,
to steal for her!

38:44.561 --> 38:45.626
Do you have any proof?

38:45.628 --> 38:47.162
Some bank receipts and...

38:47.164 --> 38:49.834
Enough talk! This is
obviously part of the test.

38:54.238 --> 38:55.204
I've got her!

38:55.206 --> 38:57.175
Green Lantern,
do something.

39:01.711 --> 39:03.246
Ooh! Sorry.

39:13.957 --> 39:15.193
Here, let me help.

39:17.628 --> 39:19.495
Green Lantern, no!

39:19.497 --> 39:20.898
This isn't helping.

39:24.534 --> 39:27.005
Now, give up quietly or...

39:33.110 --> 39:34.111
There!

39:35.878 --> 39:38.613
I loves me some capes!

39:38.615 --> 39:40.184
Catwoman, heads up!

39:44.454 --> 39:46.954
And that's a wrap, team.
Back to the bus!

39:46.956 --> 39:48.823
Cheetah, don't!

39:48.825 --> 39:50.392
Sorry, Blunder Woman.

39:50.394 --> 39:52.026
That's called strategy.

39:52.028 --> 39:54.698
Maybe I can loan you
a book on it sometime.

40:03.340 --> 40:04.905
Wonderful.

40:04.907 --> 40:07.041
You girls are
all getting an A.

40:07.043 --> 40:09.410
- Yeah!
- Haha, yeah!

40:09.412 --> 40:10.479
We work as a team!

40:13.316 --> 40:15.316
Yay!

40:15.318 --> 40:17.753
That didn't go at all
like we planned.

40:17.755 --> 40:19.021
You have
to admit though,

40:19.023 --> 40:20.689
this school must be
doing something right

40:20.691 --> 40:24.727
because they've gotten
way better!

40:24.729 --> 40:29.033
What? Is this one of those saying-something
non-appropriate times? Sorry.

40:35.005 --> 40:38.073
Looks like Katana comes
in second place.

40:38.075 --> 40:39.077
Again.

40:40.343 --> 40:41.410
What?

40:44.180 --> 40:47.818
Last one to the entrance
is a drone, Bumblebee!

40:56.360 --> 40:57.325
Looks like it's hot.

40:57.327 --> 40:59.760
Yes. Our last one,
I wager.

40:59.762 --> 41:01.098
You better
believe it.

41:06.369 --> 41:09.306
Step back. Let a real
woman take a shot.

41:13.410 --> 41:16.211
So, when will
this real woman appear?

41:16.213 --> 41:17.412
Har har.

41:17.414 --> 41:19.080
Maybe we need
a special word.

41:19.082 --> 41:21.783
Some sort of key
to unlock the door.

41:21.785 --> 41:23.053
Wait, there!

41:23.921 --> 41:25.287
What does it say?

41:25.289 --> 41:27.323
I only got a C
in Ancient Hieroglyphics.

41:27.325 --> 41:30.658
A C?
I got a C+.

41:30.660 --> 41:32.593
It appears to say

41:32.595 --> 41:35.097
<i>"Watch out below."</i>

41:35.099 --> 41:37.869
Watch out below?
That's weird.

41:46.043 --> 41:47.709
That was close.

41:47.711 --> 41:50.345
Yes.
Thank you for saving me.

41:50.347 --> 41:51.546
Of course!

41:51.548 --> 41:53.814
One to zero,
my lead.

42:03.227 --> 42:04.228
Look out!

42:05.928 --> 42:08.597
- Thanks.
- One-one, tied.

42:11.635 --> 42:13.769
<i>Obviously,
things didn't go so well.</i>

42:13.771 --> 42:15.169
<i>But we have a plan.</i>

42:15.171 --> 42:16.905
<i>If you can get
the girls alone</i>

42:16.907 --> 42:19.374
<i>and one by one tell them
about Lena owning the school,</i>

42:19.376 --> 42:20.876
<i>maybe they'll listen to reason.</i>

42:20.878 --> 42:22.443
Uh... Sure.

42:22.445 --> 42:25.479
But maybe now isn't
the best time for that.

42:28.751 --> 42:30.818
We just beat Supergirl!

42:30.820 --> 42:32.655
We just beat Wonder Woman.

42:32.657 --> 42:35.860
We just beat Batgirl! Whoa!

42:37.026 --> 42:38.626
Very impressive.

42:38.628 --> 42:40.995
It seems that your short
time here has improved

42:40.997 --> 42:42.631
your skills dramatically.

42:42.633 --> 42:45.666
But here at Uber High,
we don't rest on our laurels.

42:45.668 --> 42:47.971
No. There is
still more to do.

42:49.372 --> 42:50.271
Is that...

42:50.273 --> 42:52.039
...the Rock
of Eternity?

42:52.041 --> 42:53.541
The Rock of Eternity?

42:53.543 --> 42:54.977
The Rock of Eternity.

42:54.979 --> 42:56.845
And placed deep
in the bowels...

42:56.847 --> 42:59.715
Bowels?

42:59.717 --> 43:04.086
Come on. Bowels?
Seriously? It's funny!

43:06.956 --> 43:08.590
Bowels!

43:12.294 --> 43:14.963
As I was saying,

43:14.965 --> 43:16.363
deep in the bowels...

43:17.434 --> 43:19.667
In the lair
of the ancient wizards

43:19.669 --> 43:21.336
sit seven statues.

43:21.338 --> 43:23.771
<i>Each statue guards
a magical stone</i>

43:23.773 --> 43:27.276
<i>which could be dangerous
in the wrong hands.</i>

43:27.278 --> 43:28.744
<i>Yes, Green Lantern?</i>

43:28.746 --> 43:31.312
Um, are you telling me
we're going to break into

43:31.314 --> 43:34.283
an old, powerful wizard's
living room

43:34.285 --> 43:35.483
for what?

43:35.485 --> 43:37.686
Does he want us
to test his security too?

43:37.688 --> 43:39.254
Good question.

43:39.256 --> 43:41.323
The reality is that we have
good intel that suggests

43:41.325 --> 43:44.925
the wizard has in fact
turned evil.

43:47.865 --> 43:50.064
Oh, come on!
That can't be true.

43:50.066 --> 43:51.367
With these jewels,

43:51.369 --> 43:53.602
he will be able to leave
the Rock of Eternity

43:53.604 --> 43:55.202
and take over the world.

43:55.204 --> 43:57.472
<i>But only if you girls let him.</i>

43:57.474 --> 44:00.376
But, you know, if you think
you need a few more classes

44:00.378 --> 44:01.542
on being a hero,

44:01.544 --> 44:03.778
rather than just going out
and being one,

44:03.780 --> 44:06.383
I know a school across town
that can help.

44:07.483 --> 44:09.816
You can count on us,
Principal taller.

44:09.818 --> 44:11.019
Can't she, ladies?

44:14.990 --> 44:17.291
Good. I knew I could.

44:17.293 --> 44:19.963
All right, Uber High.
Get going!

44:22.398 --> 44:24.999
Cheetah, can I talk
to you for a minute?

44:25.001 --> 44:26.202
Sure.

44:28.104 --> 44:30.437
How about in here?

44:30.439 --> 44:33.742
<i>Wanted... Wanted... To talk.</i>

44:33.744 --> 44:36.278
There's too much interference
in the computer room.

44:36.280 --> 44:38.082
I can't maintain
our connection.

44:39.548 --> 44:40.550
We've lost her.

44:41.517 --> 44:42.917
Listen, Cheetah,

44:42.919 --> 44:44.553
I've been in contact
with Wonder Woman,

44:44.555 --> 44:46.789
Supergirl and Batgirl
this whole time.

44:46.791 --> 44:48.055
They were right!

44:48.057 --> 44:49.823
This school is
bought and paid for

44:49.825 --> 44:51.225
by Lena Luthor.

44:51.227 --> 44:52.528
We think she's
using everyone

44:52.530 --> 44:54.963
to get this artifact
in order to...

44:54.965 --> 44:56.798
Well, we don't
know why yet.

44:56.800 --> 44:59.033
But generally,
you collect ancient artifacts

44:59.035 --> 45:00.769
to rule the world.

45:00.771 --> 45:02.073
So, my money is on that.

45:04.008 --> 45:06.041
So, she was right.

45:06.043 --> 45:09.044
- Who was right?
- <i>Jessica Cruz.</i>

45:09.046 --> 45:12.049
A Green Lantern
through and through.

45:13.115 --> 45:15.216
You knew? No!

45:15.218 --> 45:16.550
You're being
brainwashed.

45:16.552 --> 45:17.653
You must be.

45:17.655 --> 45:19.220
There's no way
you'd do this.

45:19.222 --> 45:20.622
Cheetah has
come to realize

45:20.624 --> 45:23.593
that heroism is just
another word for sucker.

45:24.928 --> 45:27.095
Lena! I knew it!

45:27.097 --> 45:28.662
Well, actually Batgirl knew it.

45:28.664 --> 45:30.497
But she's super smart,
so I totally believed her.

45:30.499 --> 45:33.669
Yes. Too clever
for your own good.

45:33.671 --> 45:34.669
That's right.

45:34.671 --> 45:36.370
In fact, my friends
are seeing

45:36.372 --> 45:38.606
everything that's happening
as we speak.

45:38.608 --> 45:40.108
They'll go
to the authorities

45:40.110 --> 45:42.010
and soon, you'll be
behind bars.

45:42.012 --> 45:45.146
Oh, my dear.

45:45.148 --> 45:46.513
I deduced
you were working

45:46.515 --> 45:49.651
for those super happy
fun girls this whole time.

45:49.653 --> 45:51.352
In fact, I imagine
that you're wearing

45:51.354 --> 45:52.954
some sort of com device
on your purse

45:52.956 --> 45:54.423
in this very minute.

45:54.425 --> 45:55.657
An earpiece?

45:55.659 --> 45:58.660
Maybe a state of the art
contact camera?

45:59.896 --> 46:02.463
Why do you think Cheetah
led you into this room?

46:02.465 --> 46:04.231
There is
an electromagnetic field

46:04.233 --> 46:08.102
that won't allow
any signals in or out.

46:08.104 --> 46:10.771
I'm afraid
you're on your own.

46:10.773 --> 46:13.140
Me? Against you two?

46:13.142 --> 46:14.843
You need better odds.

46:14.845 --> 46:16.845
We do. Boys.

46:17.947 --> 46:19.446
My yellow Kryptomites tend

46:19.448 --> 46:22.550
to bring out
a lot of fear in people.

46:22.552 --> 46:24.285
I imagine
a little fear isn't

46:24.287 --> 46:26.553
a problem for someone
such as yourself.

46:26.555 --> 46:28.793
Is it, Green Lantern?

46:30.325 --> 46:31.795
I can't see anything.

46:32.628 --> 46:34.428
I think... Yes!

46:34.430 --> 46:36.133
<i>There's a light
at the end of the tunnel!</i>

46:40.871 --> 46:42.106
Wow!

46:45.910 --> 46:47.144
There it is!

46:48.410 --> 46:50.146
<i>The necklace of Wotan!</i>

46:52.081 --> 46:53.717
Oh, no, you don't.
I'm getting it!

46:58.354 --> 47:00.224
Not a chance, Katana.

47:15.671 --> 47:17.738
Let me guess,
you followed us here.

47:19.008 --> 47:21.475
To get the necklace?

47:21.477 --> 47:23.378
We're gonna have to
fight, aren't we?

47:25.182 --> 47:28.319
- I bet I can beat more than you.
- You're on!

47:34.023 --> 47:35.591
Everyone is staring.

47:35.593 --> 47:37.758
Are you sure we're
in the right place?

47:37.760 --> 47:40.729
Yep. According to my intel
this is the stop.

47:40.731 --> 47:42.963
We just have to wait
here for the S train.

47:42.965 --> 47:44.701
Speaking of which...

47:55.211 --> 47:56.644
All aboard!

47:56.646 --> 47:58.680
How long do you think
it takes to get to this rock?

47:58.682 --> 47:59.847
In this thing,

47:59.849 --> 48:01.418
probably an eternity.

48:05.521 --> 48:07.789
I didn't realize

48:07.791 --> 48:09.490
it was a bullet train.

48:09.492 --> 48:11.392
And they say
mass transit is slow.

48:11.394 --> 48:13.294
<i>Batgirl, can you hear me?</i>

48:13.296 --> 48:14.762
Green Lantern,
is that you?

48:14.764 --> 48:16.731
We lost you for a while.
Are you okay?

48:16.733 --> 48:19.200
<i>Sorry, I think something...
The connection.</i>

48:19.202 --> 48:20.635
<i>It should be
better now.</i>

48:20.637 --> 48:22.303
Uh, I'm still not
getting a camera feed.

48:22.305 --> 48:24.338
- Where are you?
- <i>At the Rock of Eternity.</i>

48:24.340 --> 48:26.039
<i>I've convinced
several of the girls</i>

48:26.041 --> 48:27.475
<i>Lena is behind it all.</i>

48:27.477 --> 48:29.211
<i>If you hurry, we can
take her down together.</i>

48:49.231 --> 48:50.463
All right!

48:50.465 --> 48:52.332
Super beat-down time!

48:52.334 --> 48:54.304
Come on, girls.
Let's go.

49:02.345 --> 49:04.211
We're here.
Where are you?

49:04.213 --> 49:06.213
<i>Above you.</i>

49:06.215 --> 49:08.316
So good of you
to join us.

49:08.318 --> 49:11.053
Lena! What have you done
with Green Lantern?

49:11.055 --> 49:14.858
You'll find out
soon enough. Backlash!

49:22.865 --> 49:24.601
Huh? Cheetah?

49:26.702 --> 49:28.436
The door!

49:28.438 --> 49:30.704
We really have to start
being more careful.

49:30.706 --> 49:32.039
You can
say that again.

49:32.041 --> 49:35.075
We really have to start
being more careful.

49:35.077 --> 49:37.778
It's just a figure
of speech, Supergirl.

49:37.780 --> 49:39.180
Oh.

49:39.182 --> 49:42.149
Wait, if Lena was
impersonating Green Lantern,

49:42.151 --> 49:43.887
then where is
Green Lantern?

49:45.121 --> 49:46.756
Right here.

49:48.090 --> 49:49.559
Green Lantern!

49:51.260 --> 49:52.327
Are you all right?

49:52.329 --> 49:54.062
I think so.

49:54.064 --> 49:55.830
Cheetah was helping Lena.

49:55.832 --> 49:58.166
She used
these Kryptomites.

49:58.168 --> 50:01.403
They were coming after me
when I must have passed out.

50:01.405 --> 50:02.736
Brainwashed.

50:02.738 --> 50:05.173
Uh, I don't know.
She seemed like Cheetah.

50:05.175 --> 50:07.608
Well, except for the whole
leading-us-into-a-trap.

50:07.610 --> 50:10.077
I'm sure she doesn't know
what she's doing.

50:10.079 --> 50:11.812
She's not always nice

50:11.814 --> 50:13.682
but she'd never turn evil.

50:13.684 --> 50:16.084
We'll never know unless
we can get out of here.

50:16.086 --> 50:17.519
You're right, Jess.

50:17.521 --> 50:18.753
It'll take more than
a couple of bricks

50:18.755 --> 50:20.820
to keep us
contained. Supergirl.

50:20.822 --> 50:23.524
One hole in the wall
coming up!

50:25.595 --> 50:27.327
What just happened?

50:27.329 --> 50:30.164
The only thing that could
stop a punch from Supergirl.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.332
Magic.

50:31.334 --> 50:32.733
Which would make sense.

50:32.735 --> 50:35.437
This whole place is
kind of magic central.

50:35.439 --> 50:36.738
Couldn't figure
that one out

50:36.740 --> 50:38.439
before I punched
the wall?

50:38.441 --> 50:40.408
Sorry.

50:40.410 --> 50:42.479
So, what do we do now?

51:01.331 --> 51:02.930
Where are they?

51:02.932 --> 51:04.899
- We're here.
- Where did you guys go?

51:04.901 --> 51:08.269
Just taking care
of a little unfinished business.

51:08.271 --> 51:10.671
Unfinished business? Here?

51:10.673 --> 51:12.974
It doesn't matter.
What does matter is

51:12.976 --> 51:16.309
that the jewels that we are
looking for are right there.

51:16.311 --> 51:17.678
We just need
to retrieve the gems

51:17.680 --> 51:19.546
without that old geezer
seeing us

51:19.548 --> 51:20.948
<i>and we'll have succeeded.</i>

51:20.950 --> 51:24.619
...the dragon.

51:24.621 --> 51:27.055
I don't think
that'll be a problem.

51:27.057 --> 51:29.590
That can't have
good lumbar support.

51:29.592 --> 51:31.725
If this guy is supposed
to be so smart,

51:31.727 --> 51:34.396
why is there a giant brick
hanging over his head?

51:34.398 --> 51:35.896
<i>I think it's symbolic.</i>

51:35.898 --> 51:37.832
Really? Looks
like granite to me.

51:37.834 --> 51:40.104
Shh. We don't
want him to hear us.

51:41.204 --> 51:43.470
Oh, nature calls.

51:43.472 --> 51:46.677
Shouldn't have had that
second glass before bed.

51:47.644 --> 51:49.113
Hurry, before he returns.

51:59.655 --> 52:01.455
<i>Oh!</i>

52:01.457 --> 52:03.390
<i>Pardon me.</i>

52:03.392 --> 52:05.760
Ooh, unless that was
the sound of thunder

52:05.762 --> 52:08.131
I think he's gonna
be there a while.

52:10.968 --> 52:14.269
Ooh, he's actually
kind of cute!

52:14.271 --> 52:15.472
Come on, Harley.

52:21.345 --> 52:23.577
There. That wasn't
so hard.

52:33.256 --> 52:34.758
Run! Faster!

52:44.767 --> 52:46.267
We got
what we came for.

52:46.269 --> 52:47.568
Now, let's leave.

52:47.570 --> 52:48.769
Come on, Backlash!

52:48.771 --> 52:50.474
Let's blow
this pop stand.

53:07.957 --> 53:08.959
Fourteen.

53:10.093 --> 53:12.596
Fourteen, 15 and 16.

53:15.597 --> 53:17.164
Wait! Katana, look!

53:17.166 --> 53:20.001
I'm not so foolish...

53:20.003 --> 53:22.573
You just lay down.
I'll get 'em!

53:31.548 --> 53:33.381
Your blasts
are ineffective.

53:33.383 --> 53:34.585
I got him.

53:37.686 --> 53:39.088
No. I have him.

53:49.331 --> 53:51.332
This is your fault!

53:51.334 --> 53:53.100
You know, I'm sorry.

53:53.102 --> 53:54.769
If I hadn't
been so competitive,

53:54.771 --> 53:56.704
I would've noticed
they stole the necklace.

53:56.706 --> 53:58.740
No, it's my fault.

53:58.742 --> 54:01.809
Honestly, I'm just trying
to keep up with you.

54:01.811 --> 54:03.510
You make me
a better hero.

54:03.512 --> 54:04.947
I think the same of you!

54:12.722 --> 54:14.454
What do we do now?

54:14.456 --> 54:16.526
I have an idea. Trust me?

54:41.584 --> 54:42.786
We're too late.

54:43.753 --> 54:45.084
We must return
to Doctor Fate

54:45.086 --> 54:47.454
and tell him we failed
our magic class

54:47.456 --> 54:48.758
and the school.

54:49.526 --> 54:50.959
- Anything?
- Maybe.

54:50.961 --> 54:53.561
Magical construction is
really quite fascinating.

54:53.563 --> 54:57.365
Every brick seems to fit exactly
in line with everything else.

54:57.367 --> 54:59.300
There's almost no space
in between.

54:59.302 --> 55:00.367
So what do we do?

55:00.369 --> 55:02.436
We make some space.

55:02.438 --> 55:03.838
Wait, I thought
you just said...

55:03.840 --> 55:05.340
You know the rule.

55:05.342 --> 55:07.774
Don't interrupt Batgirl
when she's genius-ing.

55:07.776 --> 55:09.309
When Cheetah closed the door,

55:09.311 --> 55:11.812
she must have activated
some sort of magical lock.

55:11.814 --> 55:14.148
If we can get the door open
even a little bit,

55:14.150 --> 55:16.684
I bet I can jar the lock
and set us free.

55:16.686 --> 55:18.751
Supergirl, if you use
your freeze breath

55:18.753 --> 55:20.088
to contract the brick

55:20.090 --> 55:21.856
while Green Lantern creates
a crowbar

55:21.858 --> 55:23.791
that Wonder Woman will pull
with her super strength,

55:23.793 --> 55:25.758
it might give us
the space we need.

55:25.760 --> 55:27.296
So, what do you think?

55:30.233 --> 55:32.803
Girls!

55:33.637 --> 55:36.905
Okay then. Let's do it.

55:36.907 --> 55:40.173
Uh... What are
we doing, exactly?

55:52.421 --> 55:53.657
Green Lantern.

55:55.490 --> 55:56.860
Your turn, Wonder Woman.

56:02.798 --> 56:04.265
It's working. Keep going.

56:04.267 --> 56:07.070
I can't
hold it much longer.

56:07.671 --> 56:08.803
One more second.

56:08.805 --> 56:10.007
It's slipping!

56:14.943 --> 56:16.845
- Did it work?
- Listen.

56:23.887 --> 56:24.952
You did it!

56:24.954 --> 56:26.854
Genius-ing wins again.

56:26.856 --> 56:28.222
Can we go home now?

56:28.224 --> 56:30.427
Once we find Cheetah
and the others. Come on!

56:34.597 --> 56:36.530
They're gone!

56:36.532 --> 56:39.501
Hey, Batgirl. Didn't your research
about the rock of eternity

56:39.503 --> 56:42.070
say something about
seven statue thingies?

56:42.072 --> 56:44.070
They're supposed
to be right here.

56:44.072 --> 56:45.472
But I don't see them.

56:45.474 --> 56:46.909
Wait, there's one.

56:55.985 --> 56:57.387
But where are the rest?

57:08.331 --> 57:10.296
I've got Pride!

57:10.298 --> 57:13.667
Aw, I wanted Pride.

57:13.669 --> 57:17.137
All I have is
stupid old Envy.

57:17.139 --> 57:19.475
I'll take Envy. I can
add it to my collection.

57:20.809 --> 57:22.477
The sins are influencing us.

57:22.479 --> 57:24.881
The longer we stay here
the worse it's going to get.

57:32.088 --> 57:33.724
Formation mud drop.

57:42.298 --> 57:43.300
Go, go!

57:47.936 --> 57:49.570
They're coming!

57:49.572 --> 57:51.771
- What's wrong?
- I'm out of change!

57:51.773 --> 57:53.374
Who uses
cash anymore?

57:53.376 --> 57:55.075
Didn't they give you
a transfer?

57:55.077 --> 57:56.276
I didn't ask for one.

57:56.278 --> 57:59.247
You always ask
for a transfer!

57:59.249 --> 58:00.881
We'll have to
stand and fight.

58:00.883 --> 58:03.149
Wait! I can get us
out of here.

58:03.151 --> 58:04.153
I think.

58:10.293 --> 58:12.026
This is gonna be
the best thing

58:12.028 --> 58:14.464
to come out of this
garage in a long time.

58:17.265 --> 58:18.267
Huh?

58:35.952 --> 58:40.019
I stand corrected.

58:41.624 --> 58:43.657
If you've got something
up your sleeve, Supergirl,

58:43.659 --> 58:44.892
now's the time.

58:44.894 --> 58:46.227
Supergirl?

58:46.229 --> 58:48.930
There. All right.
We should be...

58:48.932 --> 58:50.133
Good.

58:53.436 --> 58:54.801
Tada!

58:54.803 --> 58:57.872
One genetically controlled,
dimensional traveling rocketship

58:57.874 --> 59:00.506
from Krypton at your service.

59:00.508 --> 59:01.577
What about the sins?

59:11.521 --> 59:12.921
Here we go.

59:12.923 --> 59:15.992
Should have made
these steps smaller.

59:18.593 --> 59:20.063
Hmm.

59:20.463 --> 59:21.898
Nah.

59:22.932 --> 59:24.234
Hmm?

59:34.209 --> 59:38.312
Yeah!

59:38.314 --> 59:40.782
Oh, come on, guys. Work it!

59:40.784 --> 59:42.716
I don't know.
I mean,

59:42.718 --> 59:44.350
I guess
I'm having fun.

59:44.352 --> 59:48.021
Yeah. Honestly, I kinda miss our
friends at Super Hero High.

59:48.023 --> 59:50.957
I agree. Where's
the challenge?

59:50.959 --> 59:52.225
Are you all crazy?

59:52.227 --> 59:54.595
We finally get to go out
and so something.

59:54.597 --> 59:56.930
What? You'd rather
be stuck in a classroom

59:56.932 --> 59:59.066
while Beast Boy asks
stupid questions?

59:59.068 --> 01:00:00.501
- Well...
- Maybe.

01:00:00.503 --> 01:00:02.669
I mean, he is funny.

01:00:02.671 --> 01:00:04.570
Ugh, you guys disgust me.

01:00:04.572 --> 01:00:08.410
All right, ladies. It's time
for today's final lesson.

01:00:09.979 --> 01:00:13.513
This ancient device was
stolen eons ago,

01:00:13.515 --> 01:00:14.914
and can now be located

01:00:14.916 --> 01:00:17.785
in the classroom
of one Doctor Fate.

01:00:17.787 --> 01:00:21.088
Wait. You want us to break
into Super Hero High

01:00:21.090 --> 01:00:22.789
and steal something?

01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:25.258
I don't know how comfortable
I am with that.

01:00:25.260 --> 01:00:28.130
This doesn't seem like a
lesson, Principal Taller.

01:00:28.865 --> 01:00:30.396
I'm sorry, Frost.

01:00:30.398 --> 01:00:33.166
When did you get
your teaching credential?

01:00:33.168 --> 01:00:34.301
- No, I...
- This will teach you

01:00:34.303 --> 01:00:36.035
how to finish an objective,

01:00:36.037 --> 01:00:37.537
and prove once and for all

01:00:37.539 --> 01:00:40.039
that you are better
than your former classmates.

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:42.876
Well, can't we do that without
having to break into the school?

01:00:42.878 --> 01:00:45.345
- Yes, we can.
- Cheetah.

01:00:45.347 --> 01:00:48.381
Coach Wildcat is always up
for some friendly competition.

01:00:48.383 --> 01:00:51.486
And I know you guys want
to see our friends again.

01:00:51.488 --> 01:00:53.586
Well, what if we challenge
Super Hero High

01:00:53.588 --> 01:00:55.122
to a sparring match?

01:00:55.124 --> 01:00:56.823
With everything we've learned,

01:00:56.825 --> 01:00:59.191
I bet we take down our former
classmates in no time.

01:00:59.193 --> 01:01:00.660
Good thinking, sugar!

01:01:00.662 --> 01:01:03.830
Yes, I like that idea.

01:01:03.832 --> 01:01:05.332
What are you doing?

01:01:05.334 --> 01:01:06.834
While everyone's attention is
on the match,

01:01:06.836 --> 01:01:09.535
no one will be watching
Doctor Fate's classroom.

01:01:09.537 --> 01:01:11.204
Giving someone
the opportunity

01:01:11.206 --> 01:01:12.807
to nab the globe.

01:01:12.809 --> 01:01:16.242
You really are valedictorian
material, Cheetah.

01:01:16.244 --> 01:01:18.080
Thank you,
Principal Taller.

01:01:26.255 --> 01:01:28.821
Hey! Coach Wildcat is
looking for you four.

01:01:28.823 --> 01:01:30.124
Coach Wildcat?

01:01:30.126 --> 01:01:31.658
We don't have time
for his shenanigans.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.126
No. That's perfect.

01:01:33.128 --> 01:01:34.928
It's time to rope in
the teachers.

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.062
We'll tell him what's going on

01:01:36.064 --> 01:01:37.564
and he'll get Waller and Grodd.

01:01:37.566 --> 01:01:40.367
Then we can go to Uber High
and get our friends.

01:01:40.369 --> 01:01:42.037
Great idea.
Come on!

01:01:44.106 --> 01:01:45.573
Oh, thank you, Cyborg!

01:01:45.575 --> 01:01:47.475
That was nice of you
to relay the message.

01:01:47.477 --> 01:01:50.113
You're welcome, girls.
All in a day's work.

01:01:53.316 --> 01:01:55.182
- Coach Wildcat!
- Lena Luthor brainwashed...

01:01:55.184 --> 01:01:56.383
I'm starving!

01:01:56.385 --> 01:01:58.251
Girls, where have you been?

01:01:58.253 --> 01:01:59.754
- Locked in a trap!
- Brainwashed!

01:01:59.756 --> 01:02:02.021
- Fighting monsters!
- I'm still hungry!

01:02:02.023 --> 01:02:04.925
There'll be plenty of time to say
whatever it is you want to say later.

01:02:04.927 --> 01:02:08.162
Right now, Principal Waller has
agreed to group sparring match

01:02:08.164 --> 01:02:10.100
with the girls from Uber High.

01:02:11.901 --> 01:02:13.334
You don't understand. We...

01:02:13.336 --> 01:02:15.205
Three, two, one, go!

01:02:17.606 --> 01:02:18.972
Catwoman, listen!

01:02:18.974 --> 01:02:20.073
We don't have to fight.

01:02:20.075 --> 01:02:21.642
Uber High is actually a front

01:02:21.644 --> 01:02:23.811
for Lena Luthor's
nefarious plans.

01:02:23.813 --> 01:02:26.079
That's just a pile
of kitty litter.

01:02:26.081 --> 01:02:29.018
You're just jealous we're finally
getting the respect we deserve!

01:02:53.075 --> 01:02:54.809
Come on, Wondy,

01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:55.812
Stand still!

01:03:02.684 --> 01:03:05.251
Listen, Harley, Lena
Luthor is using you guys

01:03:05.253 --> 01:03:06.954
to steal a bunch
of things for...

01:03:06.956 --> 01:03:08.622
Well, we don't know
that part yet.

01:03:08.624 --> 01:03:10.691
But we don't want to see
you guys get into trouble.

01:03:10.693 --> 01:03:12.059
You have to believe us!

01:03:12.061 --> 01:03:13.760
Oh, I believe you.

01:03:13.762 --> 01:03:15.329
You do?

01:03:15.331 --> 01:03:17.030
Oh, I've known pretty
much from the start

01:03:17.032 --> 01:03:18.399
something was
going on.

01:03:18.401 --> 01:03:20.468
But it sounded
like a fun time!

01:03:26.374 --> 01:03:29.910
Catwoman, you and the other girls
are so good at what you do

01:03:29.912 --> 01:03:32.379
that we have to work really
hard just to keep up.

01:03:32.381 --> 01:03:34.314
You girls make us
better heroes.

01:03:34.316 --> 01:03:35.983
We don't just respect you,

01:03:35.985 --> 01:03:37.454
we need you.

01:03:38.354 --> 01:03:40.419
- Really?
- Really.

01:03:40.421 --> 01:03:43.524
You know, you aren't
so bad... For a bat.

01:03:43.526 --> 01:03:46.262
And you're not
so terrible for a cat.

01:03:49.365 --> 01:03:50.800
Leave me alone!

01:03:55.671 --> 01:03:58.705
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tree, really.
- No!

01:03:58.707 --> 01:03:59.740
Are you okay?

01:03:59.742 --> 01:04:01.941
This is what happens
when friends fight.

01:04:01.943 --> 01:04:03.343
Other people get hurt.

01:04:03.345 --> 01:04:05.479
You're right.
I never wanted to.

01:04:05.481 --> 01:04:06.747
But there was
this girl,

01:04:06.749 --> 01:04:08.981
and she said
you guys hated us.

01:04:08.983 --> 01:04:11.619
Hated you? I can
never hate you!

01:04:11.621 --> 01:04:13.120
We love you guys,

01:04:13.122 --> 01:04:16.157
which is why we've been chasing
you down all over the globe.

01:04:16.159 --> 01:04:17.356
We miss you,

01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:19.191
and we wanna
make sure you're okay.

01:04:19.193 --> 01:04:22.930
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I know, I'm sorry!

01:04:29.872 --> 01:04:33.707
So, decided to go back
over to Super Hero High?

01:04:33.709 --> 01:04:37.278
If by "decided", you mean Cheetah
and Lena Luthor knocked me out

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.180
and left us for dead
in the Rock of Eternity,

01:04:40.182 --> 01:04:41.384
then yeah!

01:04:43.285 --> 01:04:45.017
What? You're lying!

01:04:45.019 --> 01:04:48.622
If I'm lying, where's Cheetah
and Principal Taller?

01:04:48.624 --> 01:04:51.160
You know, you might be right.

01:04:54.063 --> 01:04:55.465
Let's do this together.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.566
What in tarnation
are you doing?

01:05:00.568 --> 01:05:02.102
The match isn't over!

01:05:02.104 --> 01:05:04.604
There hasn't even been
one good knockout yet!

01:05:04.606 --> 01:05:06.807
Coach, I think
we've made a mistake.

01:05:06.809 --> 01:05:10.376
Yeah. We don't wanna
fight our friends anymore.

01:05:10.378 --> 01:05:12.379
Plus, we think
that Principal Taller is

01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:14.247
actually Lena Luthor
in disguise.

01:05:14.249 --> 01:05:16.885
She's here to steal something
from Doctor Fate's classroom.

01:05:22.758 --> 01:05:26.492
Well, it looks like we might
get that knockout after all.

01:05:26.494 --> 01:05:28.896
What are you waiting for?
Go save the day!

01:05:28.898 --> 01:05:31.198
Yeah, let's go!

01:05:31.200 --> 01:05:32.402
Yeah!

01:05:35.738 --> 01:05:37.473
<i>The Globe of Fate!</i>

01:05:38.374 --> 01:05:39.776
Stop right there!

01:05:42.577 --> 01:05:44.678
Principal Waller? I...

01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.682
What? Why are you and
Cheetah in the magic class?

01:05:47.684 --> 01:05:50.916
Not that I need
to answer to you, Batgirl,

01:05:50.918 --> 01:05:53.454
but I was showing
these girls our facilities,

01:05:53.456 --> 01:05:55.455
trying to persuade them
to re-enroll.

01:05:55.457 --> 01:05:57.457
Oh, that makes sense.

01:05:57.459 --> 01:05:59.091
Now if you'll excuse me,

01:05:59.093 --> 01:06:00.827
I'd like
to continue my tour.

01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:01.930
I don't buy it!

01:06:03.999 --> 01:06:06.535
And people say
I'm the crazy one!

01:06:10.072 --> 01:06:11.805
<i>Lena Luthor!</i>

01:06:11.807 --> 01:06:13.039
They were right!

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.709
Of course, they were.

01:06:14.711 --> 01:06:17.044
Annoyingly, they always are.

01:06:17.046 --> 01:06:18.445
But it's too late.

01:06:18.447 --> 01:06:21.950
And I'm Lashina!

01:06:22.985 --> 01:06:24.350
Yeah, we kinda figured.

01:06:24.352 --> 01:06:25.519
- But the wig!
- Meh.

01:06:25.521 --> 01:06:27.687
Enough! Boys!

01:06:27.689 --> 01:06:30.256
Keep them back
while I finish this.

01:06:30.258 --> 01:06:35.028
At last. The final piece
of my master plan.

01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.497
What? To start
a jewelry store?

01:06:37.499 --> 01:06:39.602
Nothing so mundane.

01:06:49.110 --> 01:06:51.044
I know she's evil
and all...

01:06:51.046 --> 01:06:53.412
But that is awesome!

01:06:53.414 --> 01:06:55.416
It is awesome.

01:06:55.418 --> 01:06:57.218
But not awesome enough.

01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.718
You girls unwittingly helped me

01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:01.220
steal a series
of ancient power supplies

01:07:01.222 --> 01:07:04.992
that will make me unstoppable.

01:07:04.994 --> 01:07:06.693
So, what was the vase for?

01:07:06.695 --> 01:07:09.428
An evil bouquet of flowers, duh!

01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:12.099
Now...

01:07:12.101 --> 01:07:16.706
Feel the power
of my super mecha-suit!

01:07:19.775 --> 01:07:22.075
I'd like to thank you

01:07:22.077 --> 01:07:24.477
for securing your own demise.

01:07:24.479 --> 01:07:26.613
Demise? Wait!

01:07:26.615 --> 01:07:28.249
You didn't say
anything about that!

01:07:28.251 --> 01:07:29.852
Oh. Didn't I?

01:07:35.423 --> 01:07:37.124
Cheetah, are you okay?

01:07:37.126 --> 01:07:38.557
Is she still
brainwashing you?

01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:40.827
Brainwashing...

01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:42.162
Uh, yes!

01:07:42.164 --> 01:07:45.465
I must have been under
some sort of mind control!

01:07:45.467 --> 01:07:47.166
I knew it!

01:07:47.168 --> 01:07:49.669
We'll fill you in later but for
now, we have bigger problems.

01:07:49.671 --> 01:07:54.374
The power... I can feel it
coursing through my veins!

01:07:54.376 --> 01:07:55.678
Come on, girls!

01:07:58.613 --> 01:08:00.579
Thank you, Supergirl.

01:08:00.581 --> 01:08:03.883
I was looking
for a little super-strength!

01:08:03.885 --> 01:08:08.090
My strength!
It's... fading!

01:08:11.793 --> 01:08:14.896
What are you doing? No!
Stop!

01:08:15.530 --> 01:08:16.733
Hold on, Ivy!

01:08:20.603 --> 01:08:22.438
How chilling.

01:08:26.875 --> 01:08:28.908
She's absorbing
everyone's powers!

01:08:28.911 --> 01:08:30.274
What can we do?

01:08:30.277 --> 01:08:32.745
We've all been fighting
against each other for so long,

01:08:32.747 --> 01:08:34.448
we haven't gotten anywhere!

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:36.716
What happens
when we fight together?

01:08:36.719 --> 01:08:39.484
Super Hero High School rules
on three!

01:08:39.487 --> 01:08:44.291
One, two,
Super Hero High School rules!

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:46.091
I have an idea. Follow me!

01:08:46.094 --> 01:08:48.497
Retreating? So soon?

01:08:51.599 --> 01:08:53.902
You girls go ahead.
We'll distract them.

01:08:59.674 --> 01:09:01.475
What is that? Is that...

01:09:01.477 --> 01:09:03.276
Sounds like motors.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.799
Who needs superpowers
when you've got these? Yahoo!

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.803
Okay, Frost! Soften her up!

01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.041
Snowballs? Now that
Lena has Supergirl's strength,

01:09:35.042 --> 01:09:36.746
you're gonna need
to do better than that.

01:09:38.147 --> 01:09:39.916
Ivy, grab a hold!

01:09:42.483 --> 01:09:43.850
What are you doing?

01:09:43.853 --> 01:09:46.118
Okay, Harley.
Do your thing!

01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:47.656
With pleasure!

01:09:51.393 --> 01:09:54.158
Pliers, finish her off!

01:09:54.161 --> 01:09:56.798
All right, team.
Let's pull her over!

01:10:01.737 --> 01:10:03.806
It's over, Lena!

01:10:07.308 --> 01:10:09.778
Over? It's just beginning.

01:10:11.414 --> 01:10:13.680
The necklace. Yes!

01:10:13.682 --> 01:10:15.649
This was the final piece.

01:10:15.651 --> 01:10:17.316
What is that?

01:10:17.318 --> 01:10:18.985
The necklace of Wotan.

01:10:18.987 --> 01:10:21.053
Doctor Fate told us
to retrieve it.

01:10:21.055 --> 01:10:23.757
He said that it was an
object of unlimited power,

01:10:23.759 --> 01:10:25.758
and help the school
in its hour of need.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:29.596
Yes. Yes! I can feel it!

01:10:29.598 --> 01:10:32.168
Wait!
What is it doing?

01:10:33.869 --> 01:10:35.804
Looks like
Doctor Fate was right.

01:10:39.273 --> 01:10:41.374
My strength is returning.

01:10:41.376 --> 01:10:42.708
So are my powers!

01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:43.909
<i>Mine too!</i>

01:10:46.548 --> 01:10:48.382
What? The power
of laughter.

01:10:48.384 --> 01:10:50.883
Well, I guess it's all
is well that ends well.

01:10:50.885 --> 01:10:53.921
Bah! You think I don't
have contingencies?

01:10:53.923 --> 01:10:57.626
Lena Luthor always has
a backup plan!

01:11:08.003 --> 01:11:10.937
Now no longer will we be
called Uber High,

01:11:10.939 --> 01:11:16.144
but the home base
for the Legion of Doom!

01:11:28.823 --> 01:11:30.989
A giant flying ship?

01:11:30.991 --> 01:11:32.493
- Been there.
- Done that.

01:11:32.495 --> 01:11:33.829
Will do it again.

01:11:40.736 --> 01:11:41.802
After you.

01:11:41.804 --> 01:11:43.203
No, no. I insist.

01:11:43.205 --> 01:11:47.141
- No, please.
- Oh, come on!

01:11:47.143 --> 01:11:50.677
A little friendly competition
never hurt no one.

01:11:50.679 --> 01:11:52.648
That's one for me!

01:11:58.853 --> 01:12:00.686
One for me too!

01:12:00.688 --> 01:12:02.157
Me three!

01:12:06.161 --> 01:12:08.127
<i>You can't hit
what you can't see!</i>

01:12:08.129 --> 01:12:09.998
Huh? What? No!

01:12:24.745 --> 01:12:26.281
Now, everyone up!

01:12:33.923 --> 01:12:36.826
<i>Round
and round she goes!</i>

01:12:38.093 --> 01:12:41.363
Where she stops,
nobody knows!

01:12:49.371 --> 01:12:52.338
Shouldn't you girls be
in class?

01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:55.141
Lena? Not this time, lady!

01:12:55.143 --> 01:12:56.809
No, Supergirl!

01:12:56.811 --> 01:12:58.945
That's the real
Principal Waller!

01:12:58.947 --> 01:13:02.082
Oh. Sorry.

01:13:02.084 --> 01:13:03.615
I don't know
what's going on

01:13:03.617 --> 01:13:06.185
butt I want some
answers right now!

01:13:06.187 --> 01:13:08.387
It's my fault,
Principal Waller!

01:13:08.389 --> 01:13:11.257
I was teaching them
the virtues of competition

01:13:11.259 --> 01:13:12.958
here in the open air!

01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.694
But what I found out is

01:13:14.696 --> 01:13:16.896
that while competition is good,

01:13:16.898 --> 01:13:20.100
it's not as good as learning
to work together.

01:13:20.102 --> 01:13:22.636
Very well. But from
now on, please keep

01:13:22.638 --> 01:13:25.341
these little sparring
matches in the gymnasium.

01:13:28.343 --> 01:13:29.642
You heard the lady.

01:13:29.644 --> 01:13:32.078
Who's up for a little
group sparring match!

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:35.815
Sure. But maybe this time,
we'll mix up the teams.

01:13:35.817 --> 01:13:38.051
That's a great idea!

01:13:38.053 --> 01:13:41.954
I bet I can make even more
off a rematch!

01:13:41.956 --> 01:13:43.356
I'll take that bet.

01:13:43.358 --> 01:13:45.190
- Hey!
- And I'll take that money!

01:13:45.192 --> 01:13:48.194
Uh, I was totally gonna
give that to you.

01:13:48.196 --> 01:13:50.065
Honest!

01:14:05.179 --> 01:14:08.347
Well, that didn't go as planned.
What do we do now?

01:14:08.349 --> 01:14:11.217
What you always do
with an empty base.

01:14:11.219 --> 01:14:14.421
Fill it. Bring me my Rolodex!

01:14:14.423 --> 01:14:15.689
What's a Rolodex?

01:14:15.691 --> 01:14:17.858
Never mind.

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:19.124
Kids.

01:14:19.126 --> 01:14:20.860
I'll just log on
to Villainbook.

01:14:20.862 --> 01:14:22.794
I'm sure someone is
looking to team up.

01:14:22.796 --> 01:14:23.997
I can team up.

01:14:23.999 --> 01:14:26.865
We are teamed up.
We need more people.

01:14:26.867 --> 01:14:28.568
<i>I know people.</i>

01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:30.169
- <i>Dumb people.</i>
- <i>What did you say?</i>

01:14:30.171 --> 01:14:33.142
<i>I'm doomed!</i>
