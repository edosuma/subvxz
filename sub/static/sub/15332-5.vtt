their soccer team.

18:53.182 --> 18:56.618
Wow. You are a complete
surprise, Josh Harper.

18:56.652 --> 18:58.854
I thought the kid thing
was just gonna do you right in.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.222
[ Chuckles ]
No, not at all. Not at all.

19:00.289 --> 19:01.590
You know
what almost got me

19:01.624 --> 19:03.125
was the chicken story
from your childhood.

19:03.192 --> 19:04.559
[ Laughs ] I mean,
that was a little bizarre.

19:04.594 --> 19:06.228
Well, I raised them
and ate them.

19:06.262 --> 19:07.963
You know,
it's the cycle of life.

19:07.997 --> 19:09.898

You are one tough broad.

19:13.603 --> 19:16.171
Well, you have to be, you know,
to get through a whole day.

19:16.205 --> 19:17.239
Single mom, all that work.

19:17.273 --> 19:18.173
Yeah.

19:20.276 --> 19:22.144
Hmm.

19:22.211 --> 19:23.678
Let's -- let's talk
about your job.

19:23.713 --> 19:25.013
[ Laughs ]

19:25.048 --> 19:27.749
[ Laughs ]
What do you mean?

19:27.784 --> 19:31.086
I'm not naive. I know what --
what goes on there.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.556
You know,
I ran out the other day.

19:34.624 --> 19:39.261
You and all the other girls had
a field day with what happened.

19:39.328 --> 19:41.463
[ Chuckles ]
Yes, we did.

19:41.531 --> 19:42.898
Yeah,
a little play-by-play

19:42.932 --> 19:44.399
of all your weirdest
sessions on the table.

19:44.467 --> 19:46.168
[ Laughs ]
Yeah.

19:46.202 --> 19:48.336
This one's definitely gonna
go down as a hall of famer.

19:48.371 --> 19:49.371
Brutal. Brutal.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.406
Just for the record,

19:51.474 --> 19:54.109
that is the fastest anyone has
ever run away from me before.

19:54.143 --> 19:56.711
It was great for my ego.
[ Laughs ]

19:56.746 --> 19:59.281
Sorry.
Yeah.

19:59.315 --> 20:04.319
We should, uh -- we should
do this again sometime.

20:04.353 --> 20:06.121
You should, you know,
get a sitter,

20:06.155 --> 20:07.489
I don't know,
next Saturday night.

20:07.557 --> 20:09.658
Or do the kids
stay with their dad?

20:09.692 --> 20:11.726
Nope. Their dad is, uh,
not in the picture.

20:11.761 --> 20:14.296
He left us
a few months ago.

20:14.330 --> 20:16.098
Just...left.

20:17.767 --> 20:22.404
A few, uh --
a few months ago.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.140
Wow. So, you don't --
you don't know where he is?

20:25.174 --> 20:29.744
No, or if we'll ever
see him again.

20:29.779 --> 20:31.446
But, I mean,
he -- he could --

20:31.481 --> 20:34.116
[ chuckles ]
He could come back.

20:34.183 --> 20:36.418
Like, at anytime.

20:45.394 --> 20:46.428
[ Sighs ]

20:58.074 --> 20:59.574
[ Sighs ]

20:59.609 --> 21:01.209
These flowers
are beautiful.

21:01.244 --> 21:02.978
Yeah, I had no idea
what your favorite flower was,

21:03.012 --> 21:05.814
but I-I know
Linette likes these, so...

21:05.848 --> 21:07.716
Stargazer lilies.
Like mother, like daughter.

21:07.783 --> 21:09.885
So, it is a surprise,
you just coming by.

21:09.952 --> 21:11.753
Well, and I'm glad
that I caught you at home.

21:11.787 --> 21:13.088
Okay,
so what's all this about?

21:13.122 --> 21:14.623
Well, it's about
my wanting to do

21:14.657 --> 21:16.224
what's right
by your mama.

21:16.259 --> 21:24.766
Okay.

21:24.800 --> 21:27.135
I want to marry Linette.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.738
This weekend?

21:29.805 --> 21:32.841
Well, soon,
but I would like your blessing.

21:32.875 --> 21:34.142
I don't understand
what the rush is.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.844
No, there's no rush.

21:35.878 --> 21:39.181
But it's just that at my age,
when you know, you know.

21:39.215 --> 21:43.018
And when I met your mom,
believe me, I knew.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.253
Okay, but my mama,
she dives in head first.

21:45.321 --> 21:48.690
Always has, and...
that concerns me.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.225
And you're
looking out for her,

21:50.259 --> 21:51.927
and I respect that, Riley.
So you want my approval.

21:51.994 --> 21:54.729
Well, I'm just
an old-fashioned kind of guy.

21:54.764 --> 21:56.398
And if I could
go to her father and ask...

21:56.432 --> 21:58.033
Right.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.634
Well, and I don't really think
it'd be wise for me

21:59.669 --> 22:01.303
to go to her ex-husbands.

22:01.370 --> 22:04.873
I understand two of them
are big into deer hunting.

22:04.907 --> 22:09.477
[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
I would steer clear of them.

22:11.480 --> 22:13.815
Do you love her?

22:16.419 --> 22:18.653
Very much.

22:20.723 --> 22:23.058
[ Sighs ]

22:23.125 --> 22:26.394
Look,
the thing is...

22:26.429 --> 22:28.330
I don't know
if I'm okay with this.

22:28.364 --> 22:29.397
[ Sighs ]

22:29.432 --> 22:31.833
But it's not
my decision to make.

22:33.736 --> 22:38.073
But if you ever hurt her
or upset her...

22:38.107 --> 22:40.075
Believe me -- I'd be crazy
to mess with you two.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.676
You are a pair
to be reckoned with.

22:41.711 --> 22:43.411
As long as
we're clear.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.313
Okay.

22:45.348 --> 22:47.649
Do you think that we could
just keep this between us?

22:47.717 --> 22:49.517
Because I'd kind of like to
surprise her.

22:58.160 --> 23:01.062
[ Sighs ]

23:02.732 --> 23:05.433

[ Sighs ]

23:05.468 --> 23:08.336

are you back there?

23:08.371 --> 23:10.538
Yeah. I am.

23:10.606 --> 23:12.807
Hey.

23:12.842 --> 23:14.776
What on earth
was Garrett doing here?

23:14.844 --> 23:16.177
I just saw him
walking out.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.281
[ Gasps ] Oh, my God.
He's gonna ask her.

23:19.315 --> 23:21.049
He's gonna ask Linette
to marry him.

23:21.083 --> 23:22.783
Yeah. Can you believe that?
And he wanted my blessing.

23:22.808 --> 23:23.918
Aww.

23:23.919 --> 23:26.488
I think
it's wildly romantic.

23:26.522 --> 23:28.790
Yeah, romantic, lunatic --
one of the two.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.859
Man, I got to stop
doing that.

23:30.893 --> 23:33.895
You know what? I got to stop
worrying about everybody else.

23:33.929 --> 23:36.898
Oh. That's new.
It's new Riley.

23:36.932 --> 23:39.434
Yeah, 'cause he's either gonna
propose this weekend or not.

23:39.468 --> 23:40.969
You know,
or maybe they'll elope.

23:41.003 --> 23:42.971
Or it could just be
a 300-person shindig

23:43.005 --> 23:44.673
at the Colvin Mansion --
I don't even know.

23:44.707 --> 23:47.509
Uh, could you please
bring back new Riley?

23:47.576 --> 23:48.743
I was just
starting to like her.

23:48.778 --> 23:50.879
Sorry. I'm trying.

23:50.946 --> 23:52.681
Look, right now
what I want to know

23:52.748 --> 23:54.849
is if you ever
came clean with Dale.

23:54.884 --> 23:57.352
Not quite. And he's starting to
suspect something.

23:57.420 --> 23:59.321
He's begged off sex
for days.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.989
And I keep losing out
to the Astros.

24:01.023 --> 24:03.525
I don't think you're
looking at this realistically.

24:03.559 --> 24:06.227
Having kids is not
all sunshine and puppy dogs.

about Thomas the Tank Engine.

24:18.841 --> 24:21.276

for the world.

24:25.081 --> 24:26.848

that you don't approve

24:26.882 --> 24:28.917
of how
I'm going about this.

24:28.951 --> 24:31.319
But I am doing it
for all the right reasons.

Ah.

24:58.514 --> 25:00.815
That's why you want to
keep the focus off of you.

25:00.850 --> 25:03.418
Keeping busy
has its advantages.

trying to keep it a secret?

you're living a double life.

about promoting me.

about a raise,

about your mama's boyfriend.

from the people in his church.

27:13.497 --> 27:16.656
For his non-profit. Skipped
town with the money.

40:09.196 --> 40:11.297
Be right back. Okay.
Okay.

Lacey:
Oh, thanks for calling.

40:15.135 --> 40:16.803
I didn't feel like
staying home by myself

40:16.837 --> 40:18.037
while Dale's out
with his buddies.

40:18.105 --> 40:22.175
Did you talk to him?

40:22.209 --> 40:23.610
He promised me,
Riley.

40:23.644 --> 40:25.078
On our second date,
Dale said,

40:25.145 --> 40:26.379
"Lace, you know
we're gonna get married one day

40:26.413 --> 40:27.780
and have a million babies,
don't you?"

40:27.815 --> 40:29.182
And I believed him.

40:29.216 --> 40:31.484
Okay,
but going off the pill?

40:31.519 --> 40:33.386
Sharlyn Ramsey did it,
and her husband came around.

40:33.420 --> 40:35.889
Yeah, but you're better than that.
I mean, you can't lie to someone you love

40:35.923 --> 40:48.601
without it eventually tearing
the relationship apart.

40:48.636 --> 40:50.103
I'm gonna go
check on the kids.

40:50.170 --> 40:51.371
Okay.
You get some pizza.

40:51.405 --> 40:52.739
We'll make a night of it,
okay?

40:52.773 --> 40:53.506
Okay.
Okay.

Cookie.

41:12.526 --> 41:13.860
Linette:
Lacey. What's going on?

41:16.430 --> 41:17.797
You look like
you saw a ghost.

41:17.831 --> 41:19.465
Riley: Hey.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.700
Let's thaw some pizza
and have a drink.

41:23.871 --> 41:26.005
Mama,
is that the second bottle?

41:26.073 --> 41:27.307
Linette: Third.
