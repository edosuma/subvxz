00:04.308 --> 00:07.310
CLIFF'S ROCKY MOMENT

00:07.519 --> 00:11.730
Someone just ordered
one of your famous Kon Tiki Tikis.

00:11.939 --> 00:16.901
No kidding. I haven't made one of those
in a long time. This will be great.

00:21.822 --> 00:24.115
I love watching you make this.

00:24.323 --> 00:28.243
It's like watching
Beethoven play a tune.

00:28.451 --> 00:30.495
Thank you, Carla.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:53.972 --> 00:55.931
There you go.

00:56.181 --> 01:01.227
- You forgot to blend it.
- I haven't made one since last summer.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.437
I know.

01:03.603 --> 01:06.314
Here we go.

02:25.666 --> 02:28.586
With the recent strides
in genetic engineering,

02:28.794 --> 02:33.757
we'll soon produce enormous farm
animals to feed the hungry millions.

02:33.964 --> 02:40.553
Imagine one cow to feed a city, one egg
making an omelette for a whole family.

02:41.596 --> 02:45.641
With the advances we're making,
the future is limitless.

02:45.807 --> 02:49.310
So is his mouth.
Doesn't he ever shut up?

02:49.518 --> 02:53.104
- Who?
- Gabby, the wonder boob.

02:53.313 --> 02:57.066
Is that humorous appellation
supposed to refer to me?

02:57.233 --> 03:02.570
Yeah. You realise your lips have been
flapping for over an hour?

03:02.779 --> 03:05.405
Give it a rest, paI, and give us a break.

03:06.782 --> 03:09.867
- Doesn't seem fair, does it?
- What?

03:10.034 --> 03:15.080
That I have so much knowledge and
some go to bed stupid every night.

03:18.832 --> 03:21.126
Watch your step, paI.

03:22.377 --> 03:26.838
I guess I did carve the guy up a bit
with my rapier wit.

03:28.090 --> 03:30.633
Better go and scrape him up off the mat.

03:31.801 --> 03:38.056
Listen, friend. We got off on the wrong
foot. Let me buy you a beer.

03:38.265 --> 03:41.433
- Talk it over like decent human beings.
- No, thanks.

03:41.642 --> 03:43.435
I don't like you.

03:52.608 --> 03:54.652
How did it go?

03:54.819 --> 03:59.614
The guy's taken
an inexplicable dislike to me.

03:59.823 --> 04:02.032
Must be deranged.

04:02.199 --> 04:06.411
Have you filled in your football pooI yet?

04:06.619 --> 04:08.913
I gotta pick up the slips in half an hour.

04:09.122 --> 04:11.164
I'm working on it.

04:11.331 --> 04:13.625
- I'm almost done with mine.
- Good girI.

04:13.834 --> 04:15.876
Yours?

04:16.043 --> 04:21.548
Why do you even bother to fill one out?
You don't even like football.

04:21.755 --> 04:28.720
I don't dislike it. Believe it or not,
I was on the pep squad in high schooI.

04:30.596 --> 04:36.183
Some of my most stirring memories
are of cheering for whomever it was

04:36.350 --> 04:40.103
to do
whatever they were supposed to do

04:40.311 --> 04:42.689
to whomever
they were supposed to do it.

04:42.856 --> 04:47.818
Spirit like that can really fire a team up.

04:47.985 --> 04:50.820
- In the first contest...
- Wait.

04:50.987 --> 04:54.573
You don't know the first thing
about football.

04:54.781 --> 04:58.909
- Who won the pooI last week?
- You've never been to a game before.

04:59.076 --> 05:01.995
- Who won?
- You don't watch it on television.

05:02.203 --> 05:05.206
- Who won?
- You won, you won!

05:06.832 --> 05:09.126
OK? You won.

05:09.293 --> 05:12.962
Anybody can win every once in a while.

05:13.171 --> 05:17.048
Everybody gets lucky.
It's the law of averages.

05:19.508 --> 05:22.761
Just out of curiosity,
when was the last time you won?

05:22.970 --> 05:27.599
1974, but I've come close
a lot of times since then.

05:27.806 --> 05:29.850
It was a decade of upsets.

05:36.189 --> 05:40.108
All right. Are you interested
in winning consistently? Sit down.

05:40.275 --> 05:43.360
Watch and learn.

05:43.527 --> 05:46.863
Sammy's putting on his thinking cap.

05:47.071 --> 05:50.407
It's a wee, pointy little thing
with ear flaps.

05:51.533 --> 05:54.368
But on you, it looks roomy.

05:58.371 --> 06:02.125
Top of the page.
Bears against the Dolphins.

06:03.125 --> 06:08.630
Now. We have a home field advantage
which means you've got to be...

06:08.838 --> 06:10.882
Bears.

06:12.591 --> 06:17.136
- Bears, just like that?
- Of course. A bear against a dolphin?

06:18.930 --> 06:24.683
I mean, that's not even a fair fight. What
about the Dallas guys against Atlanta?

06:26.018 --> 06:29.103
All right. Atlanta.

06:29.270 --> 06:32.440
- What colour uniforms do they wear?
- Colour?

06:32.649 --> 06:35.817
The colour will tell you the winner.

06:36.026 --> 06:39.695
Red beats blue, blue beats yellow,
yellow beats mauve.

06:39.904 --> 06:45.408
Wait. Are you telling me you're going to
pick Atlanta over Dallas

06:45.575 --> 06:47.952
because of the colour of the uniforms?

06:48.160 --> 06:51.329
Dallas untiI last week
had won six games in a row.

06:51.496 --> 06:54.165
- Who beat them last week?
- Washington.

06:54.374 --> 06:56.917
What colour was Washington wearing?

06:57.125 --> 06:59.335
None of your business.

07:01.253 --> 07:04.506
- The laws of probability are complex.
- Indeed.

07:06.132 --> 07:12.637
Professors at Heidelberg have done
studies to predict reocurrence of...

07:12.845 --> 07:15.515
Oh, God.
Time for the Mickey Mouth Club again.

07:17.099 --> 07:22.770
Buddy, you don't know anything, so why
don't you shut up before you prove it?

07:28.692 --> 07:33.070
I'm ashamed to know you
if you don't stand up to that guy.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.321
Let it ride, will you?

07:35.488 --> 07:37.532
What, are you scared?

07:37.699 --> 07:41.743
I don't want to start a fight
over a few hasty words.

07:41.952 --> 07:43.995
Come here.

07:44.704 --> 07:50.959
Look. You won't have to fight him. You
just have to back him down a notch.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.461
Trust me. I've been in a lot of fights
and seen a lot of fights.

07:54.628 --> 07:57.964
Believe me,
fighting is the last thing on his mind.

07:58.131 --> 08:04.635
You just call him out, stare at him eyeball
to eyeball, and watch him crumble.

08:04.844 --> 08:07.471
Like two fighters stare each other down
before a bout.

08:07.638 --> 08:11.307
You got it.
The name of the game is intimidation.

08:11.474 --> 08:14.226
ReaI men have been doing it
for centuries

08:14.393 --> 08:17.645
and it can work for guys like you, too.

08:20.690 --> 08:23.775
- You think it'll work?
- I'm positive.

08:23.942 --> 08:27.445
That guy is a blowhard.
Want me to do it for you?

08:27.611 --> 08:30.363
Look, I can do it myself, all right?

08:32.115 --> 08:35.868
- Will you do something about this?
- About what?

08:36.076 --> 08:43.289
Carla is provoking Cliff into a physicaI
confrontation with that lout.

08:43.498 --> 08:46.835
I told you I don't want anything
more violent in my bar

08:47.002 --> 08:49.462
than an occasionaI love nibble.

08:50.546 --> 08:53.006
That'll never work with this guy.

08:55.383 --> 09:00.262
Look, it's all right.
There won't be any fisticuffs.

09:00.429 --> 09:04.724
I'm just going to go over, stare him down,
and he'll be the first to blink.

09:04.932 --> 09:08.977
- Wait, man.
- No. It's something I've got to do.

09:09.186 --> 09:11.228
The gauntlet has been thrown down.

09:13.897 --> 09:16.900
Hey. Beagle breath.

09:19.651 --> 09:22.570
You'd better not be talking to me, paI.

09:22.778 --> 09:25.156
If you don't like the way I talk,

09:25.364 --> 09:28.950
maybe there's something
you'd like to do about it.

09:31.869 --> 09:35.289
I'd be glad to. Let's go outside.

09:41.501 --> 09:43.462
You got it.

09:43.629 --> 09:45.838
I'll pay and be right behind you.

09:47.965 --> 09:50.342
Did he blink and I missed it?

09:52.010 --> 09:55.846
Don't worry. He knows you're not
afraid of him and he's worried.

09:56.055 --> 09:58.640
I wouldn't be surprised
if he's run by now.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.601
No, he's out there right now
taking off his shirt.

10:02.768 --> 10:05.520
Nice upper body development.

10:07.271 --> 10:11.316
There comes a time
when you've gotta draw the old line.

10:17.488 --> 10:20.031
- Where are you going?
- Home.

10:21.449 --> 10:23.492
You're going through Melville's?

10:23.659 --> 10:29.163
It's the duty of every citizen
to learn the exits of public places

10:29.330 --> 10:31.374
in case of an emergency.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.583
Flood, atomic holocaust...

10:35.710 --> 10:38.879
- What a chicken.
- Yeah, but what a citizen.

10:53.274 --> 10:57.318
Well, how did my Sammykins do
in the football pooI?

10:57.527 --> 11:00.153
Not so great. But I wasn't the only one.

11:00.320 --> 11:05.199
Oddsmakers took a reaI beating.
Nothing went according to form.

11:05.366 --> 11:07.409
How many did you get?

11:07.575 --> 11:09.619
I don't know. Let's see.

11:10.704 --> 11:15.331
Five, six... Six out of thirteen.
That's not so bad.

11:15.540 --> 11:19.668
- This. This.
- Yeah, OK. All right. Five.

11:22.629 --> 11:24.672
Four. All right, four.

11:26.007 --> 11:29.676
- Poor Sam.
- You kidding me? Poor everybody.

11:29.884 --> 11:32.637
No win day.
Upsets right across the board.

11:32.845 --> 11:37.390
I defy anybody to predict
how those games turned out.

11:38.307 --> 11:40.601
How did you do?

11:40.768 --> 11:45.230
Well, I'm afraid
I didn't do very well either.

11:45.439 --> 11:51.026
I went with cities whose symphonies
are led by foreign-born conductors.

11:54.112 --> 11:57.031
- You're kidding, aren't you?
- No.

11:57.239 --> 11:59.282
Bet you did great with that system.

11:59.449 --> 12:02.785
Not really. I only got eleven.

12:06.747 --> 12:08.789
Well, the heck you did.

12:08.956 --> 12:11.083
You got twelve.

12:12.792 --> 12:16.545
- Twelve out of thirteen.
- You're right, I miscounted.

12:16.754 --> 12:20.174
And the one you missed,
you missed by a mile.

12:20.340 --> 12:24.260
There's a new rule.
All blonde waitresses out of the pooI.

12:24.427 --> 12:26.887
You don't get to bet on football
any more.

12:27.095 --> 12:31.015
You are destroying the sport of football.

12:34.309 --> 12:36.519
OK, fine.

12:36.728 --> 12:38.771
If it's so important to you.

12:39.897 --> 12:44.609
But this makes it impossible
to test my theory on state flowers.

12:57.702 --> 13:00.204
- Hey, everybody.
- Hey, Cliff.

13:00.412 --> 13:03.665
Meet my post office paI here, Lewis.

13:06.584 --> 13:09.169
- The whole gang.
- Pleasure to meet you.

13:09.377 --> 13:11.421
Can I have a couple of beers here?

13:11.588 --> 13:15.424
So what have you got
the muscle for, huh?

13:15.591 --> 13:19.427
What are you talking about?
Lewis and I go way back.

13:22.638 --> 13:24.681
Enjoy, Lewis.

13:25.723 --> 13:28.643
- Thanks, Chris.
- It's Cliff.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.644
My pleasure.

13:32.020 --> 13:34.939
You look like an athlete.
You play football?

13:35.147 --> 13:38.150
A little bit. Mostly, I'm a fighter.

13:38.317 --> 13:42.070
You're... You're a fighter?

13:42.237 --> 13:46.114
You think you know a guy and
he can still surprise you like that.

13:46.323 --> 13:48.366
I didn't know you were a fighter.

13:48.532 --> 13:51.285
That's what you asked for
on the bulletin board.

13:58.123 --> 14:01.376
"Lewis the kidder" -
that's what they call him.

14:01.542 --> 14:04.629
It's Sam. I want to put $200
on tonight's game.

14:04.795 --> 14:08.840
Maybe you can help me out.
Which is the more dominant flower,

14:09.048 --> 14:12.468
the mountain lily or black-eyed Susan?

14:12.635 --> 14:16.137
How am I supposed to know
Leslie Uggams?

14:18.347 --> 14:20.391
Don't...

14:21.058 --> 14:25.520
Don't get me wrong. It's not like I think
all black people know each other.

14:27.437 --> 14:31.899
It's just all good-looking people
with lots of warmth...

14:32.566 --> 14:34.610
Can I have another beer, Coach?

14:43.158 --> 14:45.201
Round one.

14:46.953 --> 14:52.374
Come on. I'm a man of peace.
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.

14:53.457 --> 14:57.669
If, on the other hand, my loud-mouthed
brothers were to start trouble,

14:57.877 --> 14:59.921
that's their business.

15:00.088 --> 15:01.880
Scotch.

15:02.089 --> 15:06.384
Did you hear about the studies
done at Johns Hopkins

15:06.551 --> 15:11.096
about the Y chromosome
of persistent bar troublemakers?

15:12.139 --> 15:17.643
They found a striking similarity between
that and chronic droolers and idiots.

15:17.810 --> 15:19.853
OK, that's it.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.063
Shut up, friend, and step outside.

15:22.230 --> 15:26.066
This time you go first
so you can't give me the slip.

15:26.233 --> 15:33.363
I'd like to, but I think that'd be rude
to my enormous friend Lewis.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.289
What's the problem?

15:45.456 --> 15:50.668
Wait. I got no quarreI with you, paI.
This guy here's getting on my nerves.

15:50.877 --> 15:54.045
What exactly is it about him
that bothers you?

15:54.212 --> 15:59.341
I don't know. The fact that he comes on
as such an authority on everything.

15:59.508 --> 16:03.803
- Hey. It's a free country.
- I know. I know it's a free country.

16:03.970 --> 16:08.182
But it bugs me. He's got an opinion
on every subject.

16:08.348 --> 16:10.392
He never shuts up.

16:12.852 --> 16:16.980
You know, he does the same thing
down at the post office.

16:21.567 --> 16:23.527
Nobody beats him up over it.

16:23.735 --> 16:28.363
You know, his whole attitude
rubs me the wrong way.

16:28.572 --> 16:32.326
I know what you mean.
Those kind of guys just do it to you.

16:34.410 --> 16:38.455
- Who knows why?
- Well, actually, sociology...

16:38.622 --> 16:40.248
Shut up, Clint.

16:41.415 --> 16:43.792
It's Cliff. Like another beer?

16:44.001 --> 16:46.294
No. I don't think so.

16:48.004 --> 16:50.047
I think I'm going home.

16:51.673 --> 16:53.717
Let me give you a ride.

16:53.884 --> 16:57.720
No. I don't want my neighbours
seeing me in a Studebaker.

17:06.435 --> 17:08.478
Now, then.

17:10.230 --> 17:14.441
I believe we were gonna step outside.

17:20.362 --> 17:22.405
All right.

17:25.324 --> 17:29.619
All right, look. I'm a black belt in karate,
my hands are lethaI weapons.

17:31.537 --> 17:35.123
Karate. Can you believe this guy?

17:35.290 --> 17:39.293
Tell you what. I'll give you a chance
to get out of here.

17:39.460 --> 17:42.295
I'm gonna go in the back
and play pooI.

17:42.504 --> 17:45.590
You can say goodbye to your friends.

17:45.799 --> 17:49.468
But listen.
If you're still here when I get back,

17:49.677 --> 17:53.096
we're going outside
if I have to drag you there.

17:56.682 --> 17:58.725
Karate, Cliff?

17:58.892 --> 18:02.812
For crying out loud! God!

18:03.020 --> 18:05.063
What is wrong with that?

18:05.230 --> 18:09.525
- Clifford showed excellent judgment.
- Give me a break.

18:09.692 --> 18:11.735
It's the oldest cop-out in the world.

18:11.902 --> 18:16.614
Every sweetheart who wants to duck out
of a fight says, "I know karate. "

18:17.698 --> 18:21.367
Well, that's where you're wrong, Carla.

18:21.534 --> 18:25.121
I've been studying secretly now
for severaI years.

18:25.329 --> 18:29.082
Very secretly.
None of us heard a word about it.

18:29.249 --> 18:33.252
Yeah, and we've heard a word
out of you about everything.

18:33.419 --> 18:35.461
It's something we don't like to talk about.

18:35.628 --> 18:40.424
We don't brag about it
because it's spirituaI attainment.

18:42.925 --> 18:44.969
What? What's funny?

18:46.262 --> 18:50.473
Cliff, very prudently, in my judgment,

18:50.640 --> 18:55.519
has refrained from taking advantage
of that combative mesomorph

18:55.728 --> 18:58.980
with his superior knowledge of karate.

18:59.188 --> 19:02.190
- Right.
- Karate? Cliff?

19:05.276 --> 19:07.570
<i>Et tu, Sammy?</i>

19:08.738 --> 19:11.990
I'm sorry. Were you serious?

19:12.198 --> 19:17.702
I hate to ask, but if you do know karate,
why did you have to bring Lewis in?

19:17.910 --> 19:22.122
There's a very good reason for that.
It's to scare off the other guy.

19:22.330 --> 19:25.167
It's one of our major precepts.

19:25.333 --> 19:28.586
Always stay out of a fight
if humanly possible.

19:28.794 --> 19:32.380
- All right.
- Well, I for one believe you.

19:32.589 --> 19:35.758
- And I do too.
- And I believe you.

19:36.925 --> 19:39.761
I believe you are a big dink.

19:50.686 --> 19:52.729
Hey, Kung Fu.

19:54.481 --> 19:56.524
I thought I told you to get lost.

19:56.690 --> 20:00.027
What are you gonna do?
Throw my customers out?

20:00.194 --> 20:02.403
I'm not looking for trouble.

20:02.570 --> 20:06.323
But this guy knows I don't like him
and he's been pushing me.

20:08.658 --> 20:14.496
If he'll admit
that he's a coward and a liar,

20:14.704 --> 20:17.624
I'll walk away
and never bother him any more.

20:19.166 --> 20:21.293
Come on. What's the point?

20:22.877 --> 20:26.130
Admit it, coward. Or get out of here.

21:02.574 --> 21:05.327
Happy, paI? You proved your point.

21:06.494 --> 21:09.163
Why don't you get out of here?

21:09.330 --> 21:11.706
Look, I'm sorry.

21:13.166 --> 21:15.209
That guy brings out the worst in me.

21:19.046 --> 21:21.089
Poor Cliff.

21:22.632 --> 21:27.344
- I wonder if he'll ever come back.
- I wouldn't if I was him.

21:27.511 --> 21:29.553
I don't believe it.

21:29.720 --> 21:32.973
- Can I knock off?
- I'll catch up with you later.

21:38.102 --> 21:41.938
- Hey, Cliff.
- If you plan to hit him with those,

21:42.146 --> 21:44.524
you're too late, he left.

21:44.691 --> 21:46.733
These aren't for him.

21:47.609 --> 21:50.236
These are for you, my so-called friends.

21:50.403 --> 21:52.989
Thanks. I need a brick.

21:57.200 --> 22:01.328
- Where did you get that stuff?
- Construction site next door.

22:01.495 --> 22:04.998
Here's a demonstration of what would
have happened to that guy

22:05.164 --> 22:07.624
if I hadn't kept a hood on my anger.

22:07.833 --> 22:09.876
What's he doing with the shoe off?

22:10.043 --> 22:14.922
You don't have to do this. Listen, this is
not something to fooI around with.

22:15.131 --> 22:19.050
He is not fooling around.
He's a black belt.

22:21.301 --> 22:24.887
- Hold it right there.
- I won't get a splinter, will I?

22:26.764 --> 22:28.974
Just keep a good grip on that.

22:29.141 --> 22:32.394
You're really crazy. This thing is solid.

22:32.561 --> 22:34.603
It's just the way I like them.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.480
Solid.

22:42.443 --> 22:43.902
Bravo!

22:48.448 --> 22:50.741
Get that sucker back in here!

23:04.668 --> 23:09.797
Now that I've proved my point,
goodbye to you all forever.

23:12.757 --> 23:15.594
Come on back in here
and let us set you up.

23:15.802 --> 23:17.845
All right.

23:18.012 --> 23:20.473
But I'd like to have a little word
with Diane.

23:20.639 --> 23:22.682
All right.

23:26.643 --> 23:29.562
I've never taken a karate lesson
in my life.

23:29.770 --> 23:32.523
Could you get me to a hospitaI quick?

23:39.987 --> 23:42.031
Goodnight, everyone.

23:42.198 --> 23:46.826
Cliff is... going to walk me to my car
for my protection.

23:46.992 --> 23:49.036
Anybody got a problem with that?

24:01.170 --> 24:03.214
Look at this.

24:47.914 --> 24:48.915
English

24:49.305 --> 24:55.547
