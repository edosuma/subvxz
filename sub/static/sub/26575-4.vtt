11:49.560 --> 11:52.314
and Mr Igli Gramos is certainly
a rung above.

11:52.760 --> 11:56.470
Based on SC's intel, the Gramos family
have cornered the market on prostitution

11:56.720 --> 11:58.677
trafficking and narcotics in East London.

11:59.280 --> 12:02.159
But where's the penthouse?
Where's the Ferrari and the models?

12:02.800 --> 12:04.837
Their business is dirty
but they're living clean.

12:05.360 --> 12:06.520
That money's going elsewhere.

12:07.040 --> 12:09.794
DC Morton has gathered
some solid intel on this, sir.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.080
We tracked an account

12:12.480 --> 12:13.880
linked to their shell company.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.599
DDLM Consulting.

12:17.080 --> 12:19.436
It has a standing balance of £300

12:19.520 --> 12:22.354
but every week there's a cash deposit
of 50,000.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.792
Sits in the account for 24 hours
before it disappears.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.040
Money man.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.200
HOLLY:
Yes, sir, two and a half million a year.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.391
Judging by the Turin and Rotterdam
attack sales

12:33.560 --> 12:35.233
that's enough to fund five
El Adouas.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.880
If they stay true to form,
their next outgoing will be tomorrow.

12:39.320 --> 12:42.677
We'll need to make an application
for financials and directed surveillance.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.435
You get it on my desk,
I'll authorise.

12:45.680 --> 12:46.680
Thank you, sir.

12:49.360 --> 12:50.555
Follow the money.

12:52.160 --> 12:54.197
"Stand up and introduce yourself"?

12:54.960 --> 12:56.758
Well, at least now
he knows who you are.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.636
I'll be honest

12:58.720 --> 13:00.439
I think your case is dog shit.

13:01.320 --> 13:03.915
HOLLY: OK.
- NAEEMAH: Suppositions on suppositions.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.071
"The Gramos family trace back to the KLA."

13:06.280 --> 13:08.511
"Maybe the Mujtahid",
"They're sending money overseas."

13:08.640 --> 13:10.552
"Maybe they're funding terror networks."

13:10.800 --> 13:14.316
All you actually have to connect them
to El Adoua, is a shoddy nickname.

13:14.600 --> 13:15.636
"Big Shot"?

13:15.880 --> 13:17.519
I call my hubby that after a good shag

13:17.720 --> 13:19.279
doesn't make him cosy with terrorists.

13:19.440 --> 13:21.830
Well, maybe we should put
a warrant out on your husband?

13:22.680 --> 13:23.680
Naeemah.

13:24.960 --> 13:27.031
Six? I thought you couldn't run
domestic ops?

13:27.120 --> 13:29.396
NAEEMAH: They let me
in the room if I promise to behave.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.513
It takes a hefty pair of bollocks

13:31.600 --> 13:34.195
to have the DAC sign off
on the word of one source.

13:34.720 --> 13:35.949
We didn't mention a source.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.076
Oh, come on.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.432
CTSU can't tell the time of day
without asking an asset first.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.920
Where d'you find him?

13:42.280 --> 13:43.919
Pop-up mosque above a kebab shop?

13:44.000 --> 13:45.070
What does it matter?

13:45.320 --> 13:46.640
Our source is reliable.

13:46.840 --> 13:48.240
NAEEMAH: Hm, let's hope so.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.040
If you want,
I can have my analyst run him or her

13:51.080 --> 13:52.230
or whoever through our grid.

13:52.320 --> 13:53.834
That's very charitable of you.

13:54.280 --> 13:55.560
What do you think, Holly? Yeah.

13:55.640 --> 13:57.791
Sure, whatever you want,
name, NI number...

13:57.960 --> 14:01.032
As a matter of fact we're meeting
the source later if you want to tag along.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.831
Admit it. Almost had you.

14:04.680 --> 14:06.319
Find your own assets.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.439
Why are we starting so early for?

14:14.760 --> 14:17.000
He said be here at this time
and we're here at this time.

14:18.960 --> 14:20.519
Did he say to look out for anything?

14:21.720 --> 14:23.677
Dunno, just said look for a black cab.

14:24.680 --> 14:25.680
RAZA: Black cab?

14:26.160 --> 14:27.160

14:28.280 --> 14:31.041

22:48.120 --> 22:49.156
What are you doing here?

22:49.360 --> 22:50.635
I finished work early.

22:50.960 --> 22:53.536
I was talking to your form teacher.
What were you doing that for?

22:53.560 --> 22:55.119
Checking up on my son.

22:55.920 --> 22:59.391
Actually she said you're not doing so bad
so I thought I'd treat you to see a film.

22:59.640 --> 23:01.393
Can't. Gotta fix this crank shaft.

23:02.200 --> 23:04.078
Hey. Your mum's asked you to the cinema

23:04.160 --> 23:05.360
and that's where you gotta go.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.517
<i>Beta</i>, introduce me to your friend.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.270
Hello.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.440
Akash.

23:14.440 --> 23:15.840
Me and Oash got some work to do.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.195
Well, why don't you join us?

23:18.040 --> 23:19.360
I can't be going to the cinema.

23:20.240 --> 23:21.515
All the dancing girls?

23:22.440 --> 23:23.556
It's all <i>haram</i>, innit.

23:24.960 --> 23:25.960
AKASH: Right...

23:26.040 --> 23:27.680
This crank shaft ain't gonna find itself.

23:28.360 --> 23:29.714
Right, in a bit...

23:31.800 --> 23:33.553
Akash seems quite a character.

23:33.920 --> 23:34.920
How old is he?

23:35.520 --> 23:36.840
What's that matter? He's my mate.

23:37.640 --> 23:40.136
Well, tell your mate
it isn't the dancing girls that'll kill him

23:40.160 --> 23:41.560
it'll be the bloody cigarettes.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.829
I hope you're not smoking.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.992
Look, Akash is old enough to smoke.

23:45.280 --> 23:46.600
I'm not trying to stop him.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.911
Well, you should invite him
over for dinner, maybe.

23:49.080 --> 23:50.116
- Dinner?
- Yeah.

23:50.200 --> 23:52.317
With you?
Oh, you're embarrassed of me?

23:52.440 --> 23:55.194

Welcome to my home.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.716
Huh?

25:23.160 --> 25:24.958
You play backgammon?

25:25.520 --> 25:27.318
Or only chess?

25:30.160 --> 25:32.834
I don't really even play chess, Mr Gramos.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.595
This game

25:37.520 --> 25:38.874
you roll high

25:39.240 --> 25:40.435
it's easy to win.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.590
You roll low

25:43.480 --> 25:44.880
it's easy to lose.

25:46.240 --> 25:48.277
But luck only lasts so long.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.352
In the end you need strategy.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.831
Your friend Dadir...

25:56.360 --> 25:57.714
I know what he wants

25:58.320 --> 25:59.800
but he has no strategy.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.229
He's going to lose.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
And you...

26:05.040 --> 26:06.269
You have strategy

26:07.280 --> 26:09.192
but I don't know what you want.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.076
Why are you playing the game, Raza?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.439
Not really a choice is it?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.240
Just trying to make it
through the days.

26:35.000 --> 26:36.878
It's been a long day.

26:39.760 --> 26:40.760
Go home.

26:44.760 --> 26:45.989
What about the last deposit?

26:46.760 --> 26:48.035

thought he could use a lie in.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.480
Thanks for letting me borrow him.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.319
More like the other way round, isn't it?

28:38.760 --> 28:40.080

What was the name of that dog you had?

29:10.880 --> 29:11.880
HE SIGHS

29:12.840 --> 29:13.840
Ruby.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.600
Remember how upset you were

29:17.800 --> 29:19.360
when I told you you had to give her up?

29:20.680 --> 29:21.955
Yeah, well you were right.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.076
I could hardly go under cover
plastered in dog hair.

29:25.480 --> 29:26.834
The less they know...

29:29.880 --> 29:31.553
Anyway it worked out in the end.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.036
Found her a good home.

29:33.720 --> 29:35.712
No, Gabriel, you didn't.

29:37.680 --> 29:39.273
I say you walking her once

29:39.760 --> 29:42.355
about two years after
you told me you gave her up.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.150
Four in the morning...

29:46.600 --> 29:47.636
I remember.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.832
I was driving home from an all-nighter.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.319
I thought about mowing you
and bloody Ruby down.

29:55.200 --> 29:56.270
Then it struck me.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.354
For two years

29:58.720 --> 30:01.360
you must have walked her every morning
before sun up.

30:02.280 --> 30:04.920
Picked every tuft of hair off your uniform.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.634
I'd been in that little flat you had.

30:08.080 --> 30:10.436
Not a stray bone, tennis ball...

30:10.760 --> 30:11.760
nothing.

30:12.720 --> 30:15.110
Still can't wrap my head around
where you hid the bitch.

30:16.320 --> 30:19.279
So, instead of hitting you with my Volvo.

30:19.800 --> 30:22.190
I went home and wrote
a recommendation for you

30:22.280 --> 30:23.555
to level one.

30:24.600 --> 30:26.080
If you could hide that dog from me

30:26.680 --> 30:28.797
you could hide anything
from anybody.

30:31.920 --> 30:34.196
I built her a kennel on the fire escape.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.959
Nigel Briggs passed away.

30:40.600 --> 30:41.600
Nige?

30:42.600 --> 30:43.600
How did that happen?

30:43.960 --> 30:44.960
Overdose.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.393
I thought it better, you hear it from me.

30:49.120 --> 30:50.315
That's so weird.

30:51.440 --> 30:53.318
I ran into him the other day,
he looked clean.

30:53.720 --> 30:55.518
You didn't mention that in your duty state.

30:56.320 --> 30:57.640
Well, I didn't want to worry you.

30:58.520 --> 30:59.795
I'm paid to worry.

31:00.680 --> 31:01.750
You're paid to lie.

31:02.840 --> 31:03.910
But not to me.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.510

To the shop.
Shit, not now you're not.

32:23.800 --> 32:24.950
You're taking me to Gramos.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.040
Thanks to you, they've shut me out.

32:27.120 --> 32:28.696
I thought it was better
one of us take the work.

32:28.720 --> 32:30.154
We can split the money,
no worries.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.039
Don't want that prick's money, Rizla.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.155

I'm trying to get close to them Albanians?

32:41.200 --> 32:43.317

don't you?

32:43.800 --> 32:44.995
Bruv, I thought... HE SIGHS.

32:45.400 --> 32:46.720
I just thought you were a dealer.

32:48.320 --> 32:50.437

32:53.320 --> 32:54.320

32:54.520 --> 32:55.954
- Yes.
- Oh, my days.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.759
When we met you got busted for dealing.

32:57.880 --> 33:00.236
I wasn't dealing, I was on a night out
sharking like you.

33:02.000 --> 33:03.480
Shit. Sorry, bruv...

33:03.520 --> 33:05.216
Shit, sorry,
I don't want your fucking sorry.

33:05.240 --> 33:06.390
Take me to Gramos.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.200
What are you gonna do?
What do you think I'm gonna do, huh?

33:09.600 --> 33:11.637
Bruv, that's a bad idea right there.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.837
Rizla, I'm not here
for your dead input, alright?

33:14.040 --> 33:15.474
You need to start walking now.

33:17.120 --> 33:18.839
Bruv, he's legit.

33:19.520 --> 33:20.520
He'll be ready for you.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.600
You're either helping him or you're
helping me, Rizla, which one is it?

33:31.400 --> 33:32.920
I think I know where we can go.
OK...

33:32.960 --> 33:35.714

definitely not be waving that around.

Raza, you remember that ex-girlfriend

38:23.000 --> 38:25.754
you was on about? The one that scared
the shit out of <i>Ammi?</i>

38:27.160 --> 38:28.435
Was she a cop?

38:29.320 --> 38:30.720
What? Give me that.

38:33.080 --> 38:34.514
No, she's not a cop.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.594
She didn't even work at the school.

38:36.840 --> 38:39.440
Well, she came to my house
with another cop, trying to recruit me.

38:40.280 --> 38:41.953
Told 'em "No way, I don't snitch."

38:42.600 --> 38:43.670
Oh, that right, Kash?

38:44.440 --> 38:46.796
They the same cops that watch you
jerk off through your TV?

38:48.920 --> 38:50.274
Forget about her.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.190
Don't worry about that.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.034

I don't break bread with <i>kuffars.</i>

39:02.280 --> 39:03.316

39:03.600 --> 39:05.751
Your dad is always drinking.

39:06.160 --> 39:07.958
Raza is like a straight up road man.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.320
Everyone knows it in Bridgetown.

39:10.160 --> 39:11.276

39:11.760 --> 39:14.229

living with three unmarried men!

39:14.320 --> 39:15.720
That's a whore, bro!

39:16.880 --> 39:18.234
Don't take it personal.

39:19.720 --> 39:20.915

39:51.120 --> 39:52.120
NASIR: I'm not hungry.

39:52.240 --> 39:53.959
I didn't ask if you're bloody hungry!

40:00.840 --> 40:02.354
What's going on with you, huh?

40:03.640 --> 40:05.597
When are we gonna meet this girl
you're seeing?

40:06.040 --> 40:07.156
RAZA: Never!

40:07.320 --> 40:08.320
She dumped me.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.235

40:50.680 --> 40:52.797
HOLLY:
Some assets he runs alone.

40:53.200 --> 40:54.714
He likes to keep me in the dark.

40:58.760 --> 40:59.876
You sure you don't mind?

41:00.520 --> 41:02.557
No, at least you opened the window.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.190
My sister smokes in bed sometimes.

41:05.800 --> 41:08.918
You know, the sad thing is,
when I get home I will sneak in the back

41:09.280 --> 41:11.192
throw my clothes in the laundry

41:11.320 --> 41:14.279
shower, mouthwash
and then I will douse my hands in vinegar.

41:15.480 --> 41:18.393
The lengths we go to
lie to the ones we love!

41:19.480 --> 41:20.834
But he still knows you smoke.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.997
Are you asking me,
"Why do I fucking bother"?

41:26.360 --> 41:27.360
I don't know.

41:27.480 --> 41:29.836
Sometimes I think,
why does he get to hoard all the truth?

41:30.200 --> 41:32.317
Don't you mind how much he keeps
from you?

41:34.640 --> 41:36.791
I would, but for my sins
I married him.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.633
Am I the only one that's drinking?

41:38.720 --> 41:40.552
MEGAN:
Hey, Holls do we have anything to eat?

41:41.040 --> 41:42.713
I need sustenance.

41:43.320 --> 41:44.356
Oh, hey, Holl's friend.

41:44.520 --> 41:46.113
Emily, this is my sister, Megan.

41:47.240 --> 41:48.435
What are you guys up to?

41:49.680 --> 41:51.433
Your sister's interrogating me!

41:51.920 --> 41:53.195
I can imagine, what about?

41:53.520 --> 41:54.590
My husband.

41:55.840 --> 41:56.840
Be careful!

41:57.560 --> 41:59.119
I used to call her "the blood hound".

41:59.600 --> 42:01.671
One sniff and she'd bark
you out of the tree.

42:01.760 --> 42:03.558
She's exaggerating.
MEGAN: Definitely not!

42:03.720 --> 42:05.632
What was it, the miles on Dad's car?

42:05.720 --> 42:07.096
If you are hungry there are some
left over noodles

42:07.120 --> 42:09.396
in the fridge.
Wait what's this about miles on the car?

42:09.520 --> 42:11.751
What our dad? I'm telling it now!

42:12.800 --> 42:15.110
Our dad had an affair on mum for...

42:15.400 --> 42:16.680
literally most of our childhood?

42:17.200 --> 42:18.200
He went all in.

42:18.720 --> 42:21.189
Two phones, two bank accounts.

42:21.440 --> 42:22.440
PO box

42:22.720 --> 42:24.313
sophisticated, but...

42:25.080 --> 42:26.719
he wasn't counting on the bloodhound.

42:27.440 --> 42:29.591
Eleven years old, Holly sniffed him out.

42:30.480 --> 42:31.480
Eleven?

42:31.960 --> 42:33.633
It wasn't complicated.

42:34.000 --> 42:37.072
The miles on his car didn't make sense,
his office was only down the street.

42:39.280 --> 42:40.280
Jesus!

42:42.080 --> 42:43.275
How did you tell your mum?

42:44.360 --> 42:45.360
We didn't.

42:45.800 --> 42:47.951
Megan didn't think it was a good idea.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.315
To be fair I was only 15.

42:50.560 --> 42:52.313
I thought she was better off
not knowing.

42:52.720 --> 42:54.080
EMILY:
What she still doesn't know?

42:54.240 --> 42:55.390
She found out.

42:55.520 --> 42:57.079
When he left her six years later.

42:57.160 --> 42:59.311
Six years didn't change the truth,
what did it matter?

43:13.960 --> 43:15.872

43:17.240 --> 43:19.709
At least I know now why
you invited me over.

43:25.240 --> 43:27.675
You don't think
my husband's at work, do you?

43:29.280 --> 43:30.280
No.

43:31.680 --> 43:32.680
Do you?

43:35.280 --> 43:36.714
Do you think he's having an affair?

43:37.680 --> 43:39.160
Is that what you're afraid of?

43:41.280 --> 43:42.280
No...

43:46.200 --> 43:49.432
What I'm afraid of is,
I don't think I know who he is.

43:51.400 --> 43:52.629
Who else would he be?

43:54.760 --> 43:57.229
I think, today, he's...

44:14.000 --> 44:15.000

44:16.120 --> 44:17.120
Why?

44:19.920 --> 44:22.116
I don't know what I can say...
Don't do that.

44:27.560 --> 44:28.789
I'm not like you.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.313

44:31.400 --> 44:33.835

I could sniff you out under water.

50:55.200 --> 50:56.200
SHE SNIGGERS

50:56.280 --> 50:58.431
You'd have to learn to swim first.
Oh, shut up!

50:59.120 --> 51:00.873
Let me enjoy the moment while I've got ya.

51:01.880 --> 51:03.678
Never know when I'll get you back again.

51:08.640 --> 51:10.279
MAN: I thought we ordered pizzas

51:10.720 --> 51:12.279
not bloody curries!

51:12.360 --> 51:14.113
- SHARON: Oh, jeez.
- MEN LAUGH.

51:15.200 --> 51:17.556
I got a plain,
and a Hawaiian for Charlie?

51:18.080 --> 51:19.196
Yeah, over here, mate.

51:19.400 --> 51:23.110
Here, check that Gupta for TNT
before he gets too close.

51:23.200 --> 51:24.520
MEN AT BAR LAUGH

51:25.640 --> 51:26.790
How much is it, mate?

51:27.560 --> 51:28.880
Eight... nine quid.

51:29.360 --> 51:30.999
Well what is it? Eight or fucking nine?

51:31.080 --> 51:32.958
MAN CHUCKLES - Uh, eight.

51:37.920 --> 51:39.456
Do you want me to put it
in your pocket for ya?

51:39.480 --> 51:41.517
MEN LAUGH - Eh?

51:41.560 --> 51:42.994
Put your pizza down.

51:43.920 --> 51:45.274
Take your money.

51:45.920 --> 51:48.389
There you go. Step by step
we'll get there won't we?

51:48.840 --> 51:51.309
I thought this lot were supposed
to be good at maths?

51:51.360 --> 51:52.794
MEN LAUGH

51:53.240 --> 51:54.674
GABE: Oi, you forgot your tip.

51:55.560 --> 51:56.596
Don't worry about it.

51:56.720 --> 51:58.279
Come on, you've been a good sport.

51:58.360 --> 51:59.816
I don't need your fucking money, bruv.

51:59.840 --> 52:02.230
MEN: Oooh!
- SHARON: What did he just say?

52:03.080 --> 52:04.116
What did you call me?

52:04.640 --> 52:05.640
MAN: Shit!

52:05.960 --> 52:06.996
The nuts on him!

52:07.240 --> 52:09.038
You gonna let him walk away like that?

52:17.200 --> 52:18.475
Fuck, go and sort him out.

52:19.560 --> 52:20.720
GABE: Lock that fucking door.

GABE: It's clean.

53:19.160 --> 53:20.310
What's clean?

53:20.680 --> 53:23.200
We don't know where it's headed
but now we know where it's from.

53:24.680 --> 53:27.275
Are you asking me to guess?
Royal Mint.

53:28.640 --> 53:31.155
The serial numbers
from the <i>hawala</i> deposits came back.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.710
No history.
Never even been in circulation.

53:34.720 --> 53:36.040
That doesn't make sense.

53:36.400 --> 53:38.596
It's money laundering.
HOLLY: The miles don't add up.

53:39.120 --> 53:41.112
The money's getting dirty,
not clean.

53:41.960 --> 53:42.960
Who would do that?

53:53.640 --> 53:54.640
KEY PAD BEEPS

53:56.080 --> 53:57.434
LOCK CLANKS OPEN

54:10.360 --> 54:12.192
HOLLY: Igli Gramos is her asset.

54:12.440 --> 54:16.832
MI6 sending money to Syria to finance...
What faction's in favour at the moment?

54:17.120 --> 54:18.793
Don't gloat, it's gauche.

54:19.080 --> 54:20.296
Why are you getting in our way?

54:20.320 --> 54:21.960
Who do you think I'm fighting over there?

54:22.280 --> 54:25.159
Say what you will about Igli Gramos
but he's not Daesh.

54:25.360 --> 54:27.829
He doesn't go anywhere near
my source again, understood?

54:28.040 --> 54:29.480
You don't have to worry about, Raza.

54:29.560 --> 54:31.631
From what I understand

54:32.720 --> 54:33.720
he can handle himself.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.992
You know what the problem with
counter terror is?

54:38.320 --> 54:41.518
We're big and robust,
so we look for equal and opposite

54:41.760 --> 54:42.830
and then you have Daesh

54:43.040 --> 54:45.555
ordering followers to stab
any passer by on the street.

54:46.320 --> 54:48.994
Big doesn't always mean big.

54:55.200 --> 54:57.237
Well, we're not gonna stop her?
Stop what?

54:58.040 --> 54:59.838
El Adoua's got nothing
to do with that money.

55:01.000 --> 55:03.595
All I heard was that Igli Gramos
isn't our "Big Shot".

55:05.320 --> 55:07.960

One, two, slip.

55:10.280 --> 55:11.680

55:12.640 --> 55:13.640
Yeah, there you go.

SAL: Well done.

55:24.920 --> 55:27.310
SAL:
Woo! Gettin' it all out this morning!

55:27.800 --> 55:31.032
Yo, you've got to shorten that hook though,
come in closer, create that torque.

55:31.440 --> 55:33.920
Alright, and your footwork
was getting sloppy at the end there.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.471
Right, three minutes.
Every second counts.

55:36.880 --> 55:38.872

55:45.960 --> 55:47.076
Ready when you are.

55:47.200 --> 55:48.236
Big Shot.

55:48.320 --> 55:49.576
Ain't been called that in a while.

55:49.600 --> 55:50.954
When did you hang up the gloves?

55:51.680 --> 55:53.034
I know what you're doing here.

55:54.600 --> 55:56.159
You're stalling. Come on.

55:56.240 --> 55:57.240
Let's go.
