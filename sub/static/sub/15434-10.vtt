00:23.890 --> 00:29.050
And I did the senator a favor in the hope that he would do me one and use his influence to keep my brother home.

00:29.050 --> 00:31.890
Upon Dad's death, we can sell the land to the army.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.280
The land is worth over $30 million.

00:35.290 --> 00:38.600
I could use somebody like you on my communications staff.

00:40.250 --> 00:49.140
Noel, noel, noel, noel, noel, noel...

00:49.150 --> 00:51.760
He's been singing this song the whole car ride home.

00:51.770 --> 00:52.770
Great.

00:52.780 --> 00:55.980
Yeah, that's the face I made at first. Wait ten minutes.

00:55.990 --> 00:58.620
- Hey, how did you do with the lights?
- Hmmm, don't ask.

00:58.630 --> 01:00.290
Hey, Coop, do you know any other songs?

01:00.300 --> 01:01.430
- Yeah!
- Awesome.

01:01.440 --> 01:04.950
#Jingle bells, Batman smells, Robin laid an egg#

01:04.959 --> 01:08.460
#The batmobile lost its wheel, and the Joker got away, hey!#

01:08.460 --> 01:12.430
Awesome, dude. Rocks. Go practice upstairs.

01:14.080 --> 01:17.850
- Hey, babe. How are you?
- I'm good. You?

01:17.850 --> 01:21.520
- He's definitely your son.
- Yes, indeed he is.

01:24.400 --> 01:27.000
Hey, P., What's this?

01:27.010 --> 01:29.450
It's a Christmas tree ornament. We made 'em at school.

01:29.470 --> 01:32.480
It's a Jewish star. Hiroshi's has a buddha on it.

01:32.500 --> 01:35.280
Honey, did you remember to leave your new insulin kit at school?

01:35.290 --> 01:40.860
Yeah. Hey, Mom, today at lunch Mckenzie Brillstien told me that if your mother's Jewish, you're Jewish.

01:40.870 --> 01:45.010
- Is that true?
- Uh, yes. Yes, it is true.

01:45.020 --> 01:46.590
So why aren't we Jewish?

01:46.590 --> 01:50.410
Grandma's Jewish, which means you're Jewish, so I'm Jewish.

01:50.410 --> 01:52.790
So why don't we celebrate Hanukkah?

01:54.440 --> 01:56.220
That is a very good question, Paige.

01:56.230 --> 02:00.560
Um, I guess it's because Grandma never taught us about it.

02:00.570 --> 02:03.940
- But did she teach you about Christmas?
- No, not really.

02:03.950 --> 02:06.860
- But you had Christmas.
- Yeah. Yeah, every year.

02:06.860 --> 02:14.240
But why? If we're Jewish, we should be having Hanukkah like Mckenzie and Duncan and Moises.

02:15.490 --> 02:17.790
That is a very, very good question.

02:17.800 --> 02:22.560
First of all, your grandfather loved Christmas, and he wasn't Jewish, so that's just what we did.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.030
- So you just stopped being Jewish?
- Yes.

02:25.060 --> 02:27.250
No. No, no, no, no. You can't do that.

02:27.270 --> 02:31.350
But you can ethnically be Jewish, but at the same time...

02:31.360 --> 02:37.040
Santa's just so much fun as a symbolic holiday character who represents--

02:37.040 --> 02:43.650
-- is a real, real person-- not a symbol, but a magical man in a red suit who brings presents.

02:43.650 --> 02:47.690
But Hanukkah has a menorah and candles and eight days of presents.

02:47.700 --> 02:51.020
Honey, is that why you want to be Jewish? 'Cause the loot's better?

02:51.020 --> 02:55.230
You see? That's what religion does. It equates spirituality with materialism.

02:55.230 --> 02:57.940
I don't want to be Jewish. I thought we are Jewish.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.020
- We're secular humanists, honey.
- Secu-what?

03:00.030 --> 03:04.240
Okay, Mrs. Sartre, that's enough. I'm sending you the bills for the therapy.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.350
Hey, Tommy, what's up?

03:05.370 --> 03:09.030
The point is, Paige, religion can often lead to zealotry and war,

03:09.060 --> 03:10.990
exactly what's happening in the Middle East right now...

03:11.010 --> 03:13.010
Which is why I don't believe in organized religion.

03:13.020 --> 03:16.650
What I believe in is the A.C.L.U., and I've already signed all you kids up.

03:16.650 --> 03:18.890
Want to put some sprinkles on that one?

03:18.910 --> 03:20.540
I'm gonna do a snowflake.

03:21.360 --> 03:22.590
What did you expect?

03:22.600 --> 03:25.570
That Mom would be happy to retrain one generation of Walkers.

03:25.580 --> 03:29.000
Unlikely. I think she's glad Julia's pregnant to have another mind to warp.

03:29.010 --> 03:31.470
- This is serious.
- No, this is serious.

03:31.470 --> 03:35.030
Oh, god-- the look. I haven't seen it since the audit of '98.

03:35.050 --> 03:37.130
What is it, Saul? I thought we were out of the doghouse.

03:37.140 --> 03:39.570
I just got off the phone with your brother Kevin.

03:39.610 --> 03:42.140
He finished his review of the real estate documents.

03:42.150 --> 03:44.520
The army's still gonna buy the land for $30 mil, right?

03:44.520 --> 03:48.170
Oh, yeah, right, they will, as long as all the owners of the land sign off.

03:48.180 --> 03:51.500
- Okay.
- Holly Harper is one of the owners.

03:51.510 --> 03:54.870
It's right under the terms of this trust that your father set up.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.200
She owns a non-divisible third of the property.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.220
That's why he left her out of the will.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.810
- He'd already given her $10 million.
- Are you kidding?

04:02.820 --> 04:04.740
Anyway, she's coming in for a meeting at 5:30.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.680
I'm not giving that woman $10 million.

04:07.680 --> 04:10.510
Let's buy out her third before we sell to the army.

04:10.510 --> 04:13.100
Yeah, well, if we had that kind of cash, this wouldn't be a problem.

04:13.110 --> 04:17.360
No, they valued the land at $1.2 million. We can afford a third of that.

04:17.360 --> 04:19.970
- You mean, screw Holly?
- Worked for Dad.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.440
- I'm very sorry, but no.
- We're not asking for a discharge.

04:30.460 --> 04:34.140
We're just asking for an additional three months so Justin can get better.

04:34.150 --> 04:37.260
Mr. Walker, your brother has been ordered to report in two weeks.

04:37.270 --> 04:40.250
The army needs medics in Iraq, not in California.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.410
Justin has some serious medical issues.

04:42.430 --> 04:44.030
- He recently over--
- Overdosed, yes.

04:44.030 --> 04:45.750
It says so right here on your petition.

04:45.770 --> 04:50.260
Look, Mr. Walker, this is the military. Justin is not a civilian.

04:50.270 --> 04:54.330
He is a soldier, and we decide what to do with our own, not you. We're done here.

04:54.340 --> 04:58.480
- Yes, sir.
- I can assure you, we're not. Thank you.

04:58.490 --> 05:04.300
My advice, son, as a lawyer -- I wouldn't spend the next two weeks running around in circles with denied petitions.

05:04.310 --> 05:06.090
Thank you, sir. We won't.

05:08.070 --> 05:10.460
What did I tell you would happen?

05:10.470 --> 05:12.220
Oh, come on. Don't make me cheer you up.

05:12.230 --> 05:14.700
I don't need cheering up. I've fought the government before.

05:14.710 --> 05:18.820
What, in traffic court, Kevin? I mean, God, this is the United States army.

05:19.320 --> 05:21.560
Since when do you start listening to authority figures?

05:21.600 --> 05:25.050
Look, Justin, you don't have to hide the fact that you're scared of going back, okay?

05:25.070 --> 05:27.750
I'm not hiding anything, okay?

05:28.110 --> 05:31.160
I'm terrified, and I'm pretty sure that shows. And you know what?

05:31.190 --> 05:36.210
I don't have a lot of time left, but I have Christmas, I have surfing, I have you guys.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.380
- I have surfing.
- Yeah.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.160
Let's just enjoy the time I have left, all right?

05:42.170 --> 05:46.580
Five years ago, William bought a piece of desert land in Nevada.

05:46.610 --> 05:48.990
It was a bizarre investment, to say the least.

05:49.020 --> 05:52.330
Took our combined wit, a forensic accountant and a road trip,

05:52.350 --> 05:58.860
but we finally discovered this great trust that my father left for his wife and kids...and his mistress.

05:58.860 --> 06:03.200
I think the politically correct term is "the other woman".

06:03.200 --> 06:09.300
Under the terms of the trust, you're entitled to a one-third share of the property,

06:09.310 --> 06:12.940
and we're prepared to buy you outright today.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.950
- Buy me out?
- Yeah.

06:16.960 --> 06:23.540
You sign some papers, deposit the check, and bang,
you've got $400,000 to do your Christmas shopping.

06:24.070 --> 06:28.740
Well, I've, uh-- I've never been bought out before. This is exciting.

06:28.750 --> 06:32.020
Um, what is the total value of the land?

06:32.040 --> 06:38.320
It's been recently evaluated at $1.2 million. The, um, paperwork's attached there.

06:41.730 --> 06:46.250
But, uh, um-- I'm just a- a little confused about something, Saul.

06:46.260 --> 06:50.370
Yes, well, basically, the land is being held as a tenancy--

06:50.390 --> 06:55.060
No, what I'm confused about is why William would leave me out of his will completely

06:55.070 --> 07:00.820
and then make me a part-time owner of some useless piece of land in Nevada.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.510
Maybe he just wanted everyone he loved to end up in the same place.

07:08.120 --> 07:11.380
Well, you all seem a little anxious to want to buy me out.

07:11.390 --> 07:14.140
No, just to get on with our lives.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.030
I understand the feeling.

07:17.050 --> 07:21.260
I--I'm gonna think about this for a while, weigh my options.

07:21.290 --> 07:25.460
Thank you warmly, Sarah. It's been a pleasure, Tommy.

07:25.470 --> 07:28.820
Saul, you're...spectacular.

07:29.470 --> 07:32.930
- I'll be in touch.
- Yeah.

07:34.910 --> 07:36.760
That went well.

07:47.130 --> 07:50.370
Oh, I'm really gonna miss you if you get the ax, Kitty.

07:50.380 --> 07:52.590
Let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay? No one here's getting fired.

07:52.610 --> 07:54.870
Oh, sure. Except Kitty.

07:55.970 --> 07:57.940
You should be ashamed of yourself, you know that?

07:57.960 --> 08:02.230
You media-guzzling, apolitical whoremonger! You used to be one of us, Whit.

08:02.230 --> 08:04.550
All she did was show some damn integrity.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.880
But I guess that's got no place on cable TV, huh?

08:06.900 --> 08:11.440
Relax, Jack. No one's getting fired...yet.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.830
- Wanna take a walk?
- Sure.

08:22.910 --> 08:25.130
I'm gonna miss her so much, man.

08:26.700 --> 08:31.380
It's no surprise we've received a lot of response to your
attempted bribery of Senator McCallister last week...

08:31.430 --> 08:32.140
Yeah.

08:32.150 --> 08:35.809
Angry e-mails crashed our server, not to mention the N.B.S. stockholder reactions.

08:35.830 --> 08:39.299
I expected it. I have a signed letter of resignation ready to go.

08:39.309 --> 08:44.550
And normally, I would take it. But, then, your apology generated more than 200,000 viewings on youtube.

08:44.550 --> 08:47.060
- You're kidding.
- And then our ratings shot up 28%.

08:47.060 --> 08:51.420
Wow. So you... don't want me to resign?

08:51.450 --> 08:52.860
Hell no.

08:52.860 --> 08:55.220
In fact, I want to tailor the show to your strengths.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.280
I have strengths?

08:56.290 --> 09:01.390
Kitty, your range, your appeal-- you've got it all--multitudes, like Emily Dickinson.

09:01.390 --> 09:02.800
Oh, I think you mean Walt Whitman.

09:02.810 --> 09:08.120
See? You're smart--an American woman with vulnerability and guts.

09:08.140 --> 09:11.810
No more banter, no more stunts, just you alone up there every week.

09:11.820 --> 09:14.500
W-wait a minute. Did--did you just say "alone"?

09:14.510 --> 09:16.550
Warren's contract is up in a month.

09:16.560 --> 09:19.320
We're developing a Jon Stewart-like vehicle for Jack.

09:21.020 --> 09:23.730
Wow. Does Warren know any of this?

09:23.740 --> 09:27.660
No. I wanted to feel you out first.

09:30.950 --> 09:32.520
So?

09:39.500 --> 09:45.380
All right, now I want you to think carefully. This is a very big decision.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.030
These trees smell funny.

09:47.040 --> 09:52.570
Oh, no, no. They smell like winter and Christmas.

09:52.590 --> 09:56.880
Oh, oh! Look at this. This could be it.

09:56.890 --> 10:01.390
Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Oh, sir? We'd like to get this tree.

10:01.400 --> 10:04.000
- I'll be right there.
- Great. Thanks.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.260
- Grandma...
- Yeah?

10:06.260 --> 10:09.580
Who does God like more, Christians or Jew?

10:09.590 --> 10:11.060
She likes everybody equally.

10:11.070 --> 10:15.180
But who does he listen to more, you know, when they pray?

10:15.500 --> 10:20.330
He listens to everybody, Sweetie. He or she or whomever or whatever God is--

10:20.340 --> 10:22.390
I need God to listen.

10:23.020 --> 10:27.340
Why? Why do you need God to listen?

10:27.340 --> 10:29.610
To make me better.

10:29.630 --> 10:35.950
Oh, Paige. Do you think God would cure your diabetes if you were Jewish?

10:35.970 --> 10:38.840
I've been praying, and I'm still not better.

10:38.870 --> 10:41.670
Maybe it's because I'm not Jewish enough.

10:41.690 --> 10:44.700
Is that why you want to celebrate Hanukkah?

10:46.290 --> 10:49.710
Oh, honey. Honey.

10:49.730 --> 10:53.620
I'm stunned, Sarah. You can live comfortably with this deception?

10:53.630 --> 10:57.120
Weighing Holly Harper's well-being against the future of this company?

10:57.130 --> 10:59.000
Yeah, I am. I'm pretty comfortable.

10:59.010 --> 11:01.020
Saul, I think you would be, too, if you weren't thinking with your--

11:01.030 --> 11:04.010
I may be weakened by my personal feelings, but you're blinded by yours.

11:04.020 --> 11:07.750
You tell me this isn't more about screwing over your father's mistress than saving his company.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.360
It's about building a future for the company, Saul.

11:10.400 --> 11:15.920
- Screwing Holly is merely a perk.
- This plan isn't working, Sarah.

11:15.930 --> 11:18.350
We are out of options.

11:19.160 --> 11:21.430
Look...

11:22.250 --> 11:25.160
Your father wanted her to have this.

11:25.180 --> 11:30.170
You might even say it was his last wish. Are you prepared to deny him that?

11:32.000 --> 11:35.140
- You don't fight fair, Saul.
- No.

11:36.710 --> 11:41.970
Okay. Call her up. This should be fun.

11:42.490 --> 11:48.150
She just stood there, a sobbing little sad girl, surrounded by Christmas trees.

11:48.150 --> 11:50.420
So wait, we're not having Christmas?

11:50.440 --> 11:52.560
- Well, that sucks.
- Oh, Justin.

11:52.570 --> 11:59.600
We are having Christmas and Hanukkah both-- bells, whistles, latkes, ornaments, carols-- the works.

11:59.610 --> 12:00.440
Well, I think it's great.

12:00.460 --> 12:03.390
I think it's great that we're finally embracing our multiculturalism.

12:03.410 --> 12:05.610
Uncle Saul will be in heaven.

12:05.610 --> 12:08.850
Wait a minute. Martha Stewart has Hanukkah recipes?

12:08.860 --> 12:13.980
Actually, I prefer "Joy of Cooking". There's something a bit off about Martha's. I can't put my finger on it.

12:13.980 --> 12:18.460
But the point is, that little girl is in the midst of a massive spiritual crisis.

12:18.490 --> 12:20.330
What, and fried batter's gonna cheer her up?

12:21.070 --> 12:24.680
And candles and songs and prayers.

12:24.690 --> 12:27.350
We'll get a rabbi. We'll make a video.

12:27.370 --> 12:30.750
Hey, why don't we hire Neil Diamond to come over and sing "Havah Nagilah"?

12:30.770 --> 12:32.260
Paige has had a terrible year.

12:32.260 --> 12:38.060
If she wants to look for God, then I will put aside my distaste for empty religious ritual,

12:38.060 --> 12:40.320
and I will look with her. We all will.

12:40.330 --> 12:45.260
Um, I hate to be a killjoy, but do you remember all those peace marches that you took me to?

12:46.270 --> 12:48.220
Do you see what happened?

12:48.230 --> 12:50.080
Well, it seems to me the only thing that has happened is

12:50.090 --> 12:54.430
you've been offered your own TV show to spout out your nonsense.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.540
So perhaps my methods were not as foolish after all.

12:57.560 --> 13:00.650
- Yeah, well, poor Warren.
- Poor Warren!

13:00.660 --> 13:04.110
Mom, you're supposed to be on my side. I feel bad enough as it is already.

13:04.120 --> 13:07.070
Would you-- would you please stop chewing like a cow?

13:07.880 --> 13:11.170
Where is everyone? I've got it.

13:11.190 --> 13:12.330
What?

13:12.340 --> 13:14.940
Kevin, are--are you drunk? What are you talking about?

13:14.960 --> 13:17.650
Look, all this time, we've been asking for three more months.

13:17.660 --> 13:21.880
What we should have been doing was arguing you've already satisfied your obligation,

13:21.910 --> 13:25.260
and that to recall you from the ready reserves is unconscionable.

13:25.270 --> 13:28.370
All right, explain this to me as if I'm really slow.

13:28.370 --> 13:29.770
- "As if"?
- Come on.

13:29.770 --> 13:32.770
Okay, look. Say I write up a contract that you sign

13:32.790 --> 13:38.680
saying "I'll get you a cup of coffee, in exchange for which you owe me five years of...labor".

13:38.690 --> 13:41.900
That contract, in a court of law, isn't valid.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.530
The terms are so unfair, to enforce it would be unconscionable.

13:45.530 --> 13:47.040
That is what we're arguing.

13:47.050 --> 13:49.640
Well, isn't this gonna be impossible to get this to court in time?

13:49.650 --> 13:51.770
No, not with a recall hanging over our heads.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.870
I can get a short order of notice. It's no problem.

13:55.750 --> 13:57.740
These things need more cinnamon.

13:57.750 --> 13:58.920
- Mom.
- What?

13:58.930 --> 14:01.530
What are you talking-- we haven't even--Mom, what are you doing?

14:01.540 --> 14:04.390
You'll understand if I don't want to get my hopes up.

14:08.810 --> 14:11.360
I never thought of that.

14:12.870 --> 14:14.770
You thinki t's gonna work?

14:14.810 --> 14:19.970
I don't know. I don't know. It's a long shot, but it's a shot.

14:21.580 --> 14:23.830
What do you say? Are you in?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.400
All right, yeah. I'm in.

14:30.770 --> 14:32.870
God, this would be a lot easier if I were loaded.

14:32.900 --> 14:37.720
Look, put it this way-- if you weren't here, you'd be working Mom's Hanukkah brainwashing brigade.

14:37.730 --> 14:39.860
Believe me, this is easier.

14:46.150 --> 14:49.140
I can wipe the floor with this guy using his own beret.

14:50.050 --> 14:53.830
Listen, I really appreciate what you're doing for me. Truly, thank you.

14:53.840 --> 14:56.600
Look, I haven't done it yet, and don't go in there resigned.

14:56.610 --> 14:59.830
I need you confident, in the right, okay?

15:02.040 --> 15:03.410
Let's do it.

15:04.540 --> 15:10.560
- and how is it being home?
- Uh, it's hard.I mean, really hard.

15:11.740 --> 15:15.090
I guess you could say I'm home but I never really made it...back.

15:15.090 --> 15:16.870
Back from Afghanistan?

15:16.880 --> 15:20.360
Yes, it's been kind of hard readjusting.

15:20.370 --> 15:25.050
- And is that why you turned to drugs?
- Uh, the drugs are good 'cause...

15:25.050 --> 15:29.230
well, I mean, they help blur the lines between here and there, and...

15:29.710 --> 15:33.510
I wanna be here... in this world, here.

15:33.520 --> 15:35.970
Have you sought treatment for your addiction?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.980
I've been looking into some rehab programs.

15:38.980 --> 15:42.820
I have the most amazing family supporting me.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.410
You tried to rob me.

15:45.420 --> 15:48.680
No, a mistake was made, and we're fixing it before--

15:48.690 --> 15:50.480
Before you got caught.

15:50.490 --> 15:55.260
Getting cold feet halfway in the middle of committing a crime isn't a mistake.

15:55.270 --> 15:59.300
Holly, invoking criminal law is unduly harsh, not to mention counterproductive.

15:59.310 --> 16:02.030
Yeah, well, we'll see if my attorney agrees with you.

16:02.070 --> 16:05.040
I don't think righteous indignation's the way to go now.

16:05.050 --> 16:09.000
My affair with your father does not give you the right to steal from me.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.680
A few months is an affair. 20 years--that's a career.

16:12.690 --> 16:16.600
Holly, just sign the papers, take your money and walk away.

16:16.600 --> 16:21.150
Do you think that your Dad fell in love with the "village idiot?"

16:21.150 --> 16:26.100
I mean, I know that your business is in trouble, and you need to sell this land to save your company.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.460
So you need control of my share. I get it.

16:29.470 --> 16:30.140
I don't see what--

16:30.180 --> 16:33.680
Well, maybe I don't want to sign my share over to you.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.710
Maybe I think there's more money that you're hiding from me.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.560
Or maybe you should stop thinking about yourself and think about what Rebecca needs.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.670
Don't you ever say her name again.

16:43.680 --> 16:46.730
My daughter has nothing to do with this.

16:49.170 --> 16:52.170
Enjoy your bankruptcy.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.190
Jeez.

16:58.190 --> 17:01.230
Had you ever used drugs prior to your enlistment?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.690
- Yes, sir.
- Which ones?

17:02.700 --> 17:04.250
I, uh, I smoked pot.

17:04.260 --> 17:06.210
- Any other drugs?
- Ecstasy.

17:06.220 --> 17:08.839
- Any others?
- Well, I was too stoned to remember.

17:13.420 --> 17:16.310
What about while you were stationed in Afghanistan?

17:16.329 --> 17:18.810
- Did you consume any drugs then?
- No, sir.

17:18.810 --> 17:21.140
- Weren't you a medic?
- Objection. Relevance.

17:21.150 --> 17:25.980
Well, I would think as a medic, Corporal Walker would
have access to a virtual smorgasbord of narcotics.

17:25.980 --> 17:29.510
Objection sustained. I think you've made your point, Major.

17:30.590 --> 17:33.550
Well, Corporal, I am confused.

17:33.550 --> 17:35.760
You had experience with drugs prior to enlisting.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.420
You had access to them during your tour.

17:38.430 --> 17:42.810
So what was stopping you from using while you were in Afghanistan?

17:43.420 --> 17:44.610
I don't know.

17:44.610 --> 17:48.480
- Was it fear for your personal safety?
- No. I didn't really care about that.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.410
- Was it fear of being caught?
- No.

17:50.440 --> 17:54.410
So we've ruled out self-preservation and lack of access.

17:54.430 --> 17:58.410
I wonder what's left to explain your sobriety.

17:58.420 --> 18:02.630
Since you seem to know, Major, maybe you could spare us the suspense.

18:02.640 --> 18:07.450
It was the uniform, your honor. It was the military.

18:07.460 --> 18:11.910
In short, it was the discipline the army provided.

18:11.910 --> 18:14.260
Isn't that right, son?

18:16.410 --> 18:18.620
I don't know. Maybe.

18:18.630 --> 18:20.930
No further questions.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.890
Why? Why would you do that to me?

18:26.890 --> 18:29.620
It's not like you haven't kept certain matters a secret from me, Holly.

18:29.630 --> 18:35.220
You mean Rebecca? I never told anyone who her father was, not even her.

18:35.220 --> 18:38.800
And if that was wrong, I was at least protecting a human being.

18:38.820 --> 18:43.910
- You were protecting a bank balance.
- No, I was protecting my family.

18:44.960 --> 18:49.370
And in that regard, our deceptions are more alike than you realize.

18:49.400 --> 18:53.450
I never tried to screw you out of $10 million.

18:54.990 --> 19:00.440
I have had a lot of regrets in my life, but my feelings have been real.

19:00.440 --> 19:05.750
I at least have had that, and my feelings for you were real.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.040
And mine for you, Holly.

19:08.050 --> 19:10.660
- You have to believe me--
- No, I don't.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.110
I don't have to believe you.

19:13.140 --> 19:15.320
And how could I ever trust you again?

19:15.360 --> 19:19.380
- Listen--
- You ruined this, Saul.

19:20.420 --> 19:23.030
Please leave.

19:30.350 --> 19:36.390
"When the Lord your God has cut off before you the nations
whom you are about to enter to dispossess them,

19:36.400 --> 19:38.830
- When you have--"
- Can't we play dreidels?

19:39.420 --> 19:43.210
Paige, this is the Book of Maccabees,

19:43.240 --> 19:47.600
the original history of Hanukkah.

19:47.620 --> 19:51.510
Don't you want to learn every detail of why we celebrate?

19:52.460 --> 19:56.830
Do you know one of the most important Jewish principles?

19:56.840 --> 20:00.770
- Bagels on sunday?
- No.

20:00.800 --> 20:05.570
Knowledge is light, and we are seeking knowledge, knowledge from this book.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.620
The holiday's not just about presents, sweetie pie. No.

20:08.630 --> 20:11.540
Hanukkah is about religious persecution.

20:11.550 --> 20:14.990
- Maybe we could sing the songs.
- Oh, come, come, come, come, come.

20:15.010 --> 20:20.240
Now, Paige, you wanted Hanukkah, and we are going to have it. So where was I?

20:20.250 --> 20:22.220
- "If anyone--"
- Paige?

20:22.230 --> 20:24.430
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, sweet pea!

20:24.430 --> 20:26.400
Hi, Joe. You're just in time.

20:26.430 --> 20:29.440
We just learned that the Greek king of Syria outlawed Jewish rituals

20:29.450 --> 20:32.060
and ordered the Jews to worship Greek gods like Zeus.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.060
That's outrageous. Listen to this one part here that I--

20:34.070 --> 20:36.720
- Can we go now, please? Daddy, please?
- Yeah, sure.

20:36.730 --> 20:39.540
Grandma needs to get going to Mommy's work. I don't know what it is.

20:39.570 --> 20:41.010
Um, she really needs to talk to you.

20:41.020 --> 20:43.480
- Bye, Grandma!
- Bye!

20:43.810 --> 20:48.360
- I don't know what to say, Mom.
- $10 million.

20:49.080 --> 20:50.660
It never ends, does it?

20:50.660 --> 20:53.870
I am hoping Holly's share of the land is the last surprise.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.580
What does this mean for Ojai?

20:55.590 --> 21:00.050
Without Holly, we can't sell, we can't get the money and we can't replenish the fund.

21:00.060 --> 21:02.490
Oh, Sarah, why did you try to lie to her?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.930
I don't know.

21:06.070 --> 21:08.820
Bitterness, I guess.

21:08.840 --> 21:15.180
Anger. You know, when Dad cheated on you, he betrayed all of us.

21:16.950 --> 21:18.780
Sugar.

21:21.480 --> 21:24.760
- It's just so much.
- What is?

21:25.090 --> 21:29.250
Her share. What he gave her. What he wanted her to have.

21:30.530 --> 21:32.710
He cared about her.

21:35.350 --> 21:37.840
He really cared about her.

21:42.410 --> 21:43.260
Hi. How are you?

21:43.260 --> 21:44.970
Good to see you.

21:48.580 --> 21:49.430
Warren.

21:49.430 --> 21:50.230
Hi.

21:50.230 --> 21:51.530
Please, come on in.

21:51.530 --> 21:52.470
Thank you, Nora.

21:56.260 --> 21:57.640
I wasn't expecting you.

21:57.640 --> 21:58.850
What's going on in here?

21:58.850 --> 21:59.790
It's Hanukkah.

21:59.790 --> 22:00.550
You're Jewish?

22:00.550 --> 22:01.700
Yes, I am.

22:01.700 --> 22:03.810
We are Jewish.

22:03.810 --> 22:06.080
Well, um, I'm sorry to bother you.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.170
Is Kitty here?

22:12.230 --> 22:13.140
Hey.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.110
Hey.

22:15.570 --> 22:16.980
You left the christmas party.

22:16.980 --> 22:18.340
Oh, yeah.

22:18.340 --> 22:19.250
I...

22:19.840 --> 22:21.870
I just wasn't in the mood anymore.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.560
Well, did he do it?

22:24.560 --> 22:25.800
Did, uh, did Whit fire you?

22:25.800 --> 22:27.280
No, he didn't.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.500
He'll probably just wait and not pick up your option.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.710
What a coward.

22:31.950 --> 22:32.890
Yeah.

22:34.050 --> 22:36.000
I'm gonna walk if they let you go.

22:36.550 --> 22:37.340
No.

22:37.610 --> 22:38.740
No, Warren, that's crazy.

22:38.740 --> 22:39.950
What are you?-- That's--no.

22:39.950 --> 22:40.820
- Yes. 
- No!

22:40.820 --> 22:43.140
Look, just forget about everything between us.

22:43.140 --> 22:46.390
I don't want to just stare down any right-wing lunatic.

22:46.390 --> 22:48.700
Not when I've had the pleasure of embarrassing you.

22:49.500 --> 22:50.660
it just wouldn't be the same.

22:50.820 --> 22:52.240
Look, Warren, you know what?

22:52.240 --> 22:54.370
I--it's not just them.

22:54.370 --> 22:55.700
It's me.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.400
I mean, I don't know, I just...

22:57.810 --> 23:01.760
I just feel like maybe I should find a more direct way...

23:01.760 --> 23:02.320
I don't know.

23:02.320 --> 23:05.280
You know, maybe working for...

23:06.280 --> 23:07.660
for somebody that I can believe in.

23:07.660 --> 23:10.210
I mean, do you believe in those guys?

23:10.900 --> 23:11.610
Wait.

23:11.610 --> 23:12.710
What?

23:14.630 --> 23:17.230
It's McCallister, isn't it?

23:17.230 --> 23:19.160
He's the guy you believe in.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.940
Oh, please.

23:25.060 --> 23:26.230
Do you know where Paige is?

23:26.230 --> 23:27.350
I can't find her anywhere.

23:27.350 --> 23:29.010
Yeah, she's upstairs with Joe.

23:29.010 --> 23:29.880
Oh.

23:29.880 --> 23:33.470
Actually, uh, I-I don't think she wants to come down.

23:33.470 --> 23:35.480
She's a bit intimidated by all this.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.720
By all what?

23:38.880 --> 23:40.600
By tonight, Nora.

23:43.030 --> 23:47.380
I couldn't be more Jewish, and I'm overwhelmed by your intensity.

23:52.340 --> 23:53.970
Where's Paige? Is she okay?

23:53.970 --> 23:54.710
Uh, yeah.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.570
She's just upstairs watching TV.

23:56.570 --> 23:57.530
I don't understand.

23:57.530 --> 23:58.360
All of this is for her.

23:58.360 --> 23:59.030
Let's go get her.

23:59.030 --> 24:00.470
Nora, let her be.

24:00.470 --> 24:03.660
We have to light the candles, do the prayers, recite the blessing.

24:03.660 --> 24:04.950
Nora, she's overwhelmed.

24:04.950 --> 24:06.230
Just let her watch cartoons.

24:06.230 --> 24:08.930
But this whole night is so Paige can have Hanukkah.

24:08.930 --> 24:10.190
She insisted upon it.

24:10.190 --> 24:13.630
She's a young girl, and she wanted to explore her heritage a little bit.

24:13.630 --> 24:16.300
She didn't enroll in a seminar in Judaism.

24:27.400 --> 24:28.260
Honey?

24:28.410 --> 24:29.490
Hey, P.

24:29.490 --> 24:30.990
Everyone's fighting.

24:30.990 --> 24:31.970
It's all my fault.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.930
I've ruined Hanukkah.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.690
Ruined Hanukkah?

24:35.690 --> 24:37.100
Is that what I heard?

24:37.100 --> 24:38.710
You didn't ruin Hanukkah.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.640
You come with me, sweetheart.

24:40.640 --> 24:42.460
Excuse us, please. Thank you.

24:42.460 --> 24:45.600
I wanna thank you all for joining us in celebrating the miracle of the oil.

24:46.390 --> 24:48.460
As you can see, this is not a traditional Hanukkah.

24:48.460 --> 24:50.230
But anyway, who cares, right?

24:50.950 --> 24:56.990
So we're here tonight because of Paige, because this little girl is searching for a miracle.

24:58.680 --> 25:00.500
A lot has been taken away from her this year.

25:03.240 --> 25:05.050
A lot has been taken away from all of us.

25:06.800 --> 25:07.840
We lost William.

25:09.570 --> 25:11.410
We lost a perfect bill of health.

25:13.090 --> 25:15.020
We lost relationships.

25:15.020 --> 25:16.600
We can lose everything.

25:17.020 --> 25:21.450
Judaism teaches us to accept whatever obstacles are placed in front of us

25:21.450 --> 25:24.320
and sometimes they are seemingly insurmountable.

25:25.290 --> 25:26.800
But if we have faith...

25:28.480 --> 25:33.600
and not just faith in God, but faith in family ,in learning...

25:35.870 --> 25:39.870
faith in each other, faith in ourselves,

25:40.620 --> 25:45.990
if we have that, then we can live, no matter what has come before.

25:47.410 --> 25:50.260
And that, Paige, is the miracle of this evening.

25:50.590 --> 25:55.880
It is a miracle of faith-- that the oil will burn no matter what.

25:56.300 --> 26:00.020
And so, Paige, you are going to...

26:00.790 --> 26:02.520
light the first candle.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.610
You are going to light the light.

26:11.500 --> 26:17.640
Baruch ata adonai, elohenu melech ha-olamasher kideshanu be-mitzvotav, ve-tzivanu le-hadlikner shel hanukah.

26:55.990 --> 26:56.740
38.

26:58.360 --> 26:59.200
38?

26:59.200 --> 27:05.670
That's how many people I treated on the battlefield, and every one got a heart to take home.

27:06.650 --> 27:10.140
Look, I know you're not gonna get anything for doing this for me, which is why I want you

27:10.140 --> 27:11.000
Justin, you don't have to say any of this.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.420
Look, come on, let me finish, okay?

27:14.670 --> 27:15.590
Okay.

27:17.270 --> 27:24.070
Look, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I know you think you need to fix this and fix me...

27:24.660 --> 27:25.460
but you can't.

27:25.460 --> 27:27.410
- It's not that I'm trying to fix 
- Look, you can't.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.310
No one did this to me.

27:36.520 --> 27:39.910
I need to make it right, and that's what I'm gonna do.

27:44.460 --> 27:45.520
I love you.

27:46.750 --> 27:47.940
You're so gay.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.660
Happy Holidays.

28:09.170 --> 28:12.990
If you've come here to bully me out of something that is legally mine...

28:12.990 --> 28:14.830
There will be no bullying tonight.

28:14.830 --> 28:16.770
At least not from me, I'm not in the mood.

28:17.410 --> 28:20.650
I brought you an almond pavlova with lemon curd and strawberries.

28:20.650 --> 28:22.190
I made it for Hanukkah.

28:22.720 --> 28:25.860
You're Jewish again now that William's gone?

28:25.860 --> 28:28.260
My granddaughter wanted to celebrate Hanukkah.

28:28.260 --> 28:30.270
We just had a lovely little party.

28:30.270 --> 28:32.570
How do I know it's not poisoned?

28:32.950 --> 28:34.610
Holly, please, there...

28:34.610 --> 28:36.810
are some things I want to say to you,

28:36.810 --> 28:40.400
and I don't want to forget what they are, so if I could please just speak with you?

28:42.720 --> 28:43.630
Sure.

28:44.610 --> 28:45.530
Come on in.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.280
Uh, I...

28:53.680 --> 28:55.180
I came here...

28:58.330 --> 28:59.440
to forgive you.

29:01.930 --> 29:03.840
From the bottom of my heart.

29:06.160 --> 29:11.430
William was a- a strong and generous man, and he always took care of the people he loved.

29:13.170 --> 29:16.310
The thing is, he loved two women.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.110
It's as simple as that.

29:19.930 --> 29:24.800
For so long, I tried to convince myself that what he had with you had no depth, that it wasn't real.

29:25.280 --> 29:31.540
It wasn't a big, happy family like you had, but it was real, Nora.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.460
Yes, I know that.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.190
But I was not his "ball and chain," either.

29:40.500 --> 29:41.710
No...

29:42.710 --> 29:44.290
you weren't.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.010
That land, it's yours.

29:48.010 --> 29:49.430
He left it for you.

29:49.600 --> 29:52.800
And if you want to keep it for whatever reason, then you have it keep it.

29:55.060 --> 29:56.410
But if there's...

29:57.140 --> 30:03.440
any way, any place in your heart, we really need it.

30:03.440 --> 30:04.650
We need...

30:06.160 --> 30:07.720
you. We...

30:07.720 --> 30:09.180
need your help.

30:13.170 --> 30:14.320
So just...

30:15.030 --> 30:17.690
please consider it for my family.

30:19.900 --> 30:22.060
I appreciate you coming here.

30:22.090 --> 30:23.210
I do.

30:23.210 --> 30:25.330
Thank you for listening to me.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.040
I'm sorry.

30:27.450 --> 30:28.840
You're sorry?

30:28.840 --> 30:30.130
For both of us.

30:55.990 --> 31:00.050
Your Honor, Major Guinness and I actually agree on a few things.

31:00.050 --> 31:06.220
Now Justin was a good solider and a fine medic, but he came back damaged.

31:06.360 --> 31:11.700
He came back damaged and he turned to drugs for numbness, for escape.

31:11.700 --> 31:18.730
And the drugs did what drugs do--they steal the best parts of yourself from you and your family, and they leave...

31:19.090 --> 31:25.370
a shell, an addict, who could possibly die of his addiction unless something changes.

31:25.650 --> 31:29.350
Now Justin pulled countless men and women out of the field under fire.

31:29.770 --> 31:33.840
He saved dozens of lives, and was fully prepared to go back and do it all again...

31:34.660 --> 31:36.580
in three months time.

31:37.560 --> 31:39.330
That is why we're here.

31:39.740 --> 31:45.960
He asked for three months to get clean and sober, and Major Guinness shot that down.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.400
"No," he said,"he signed a contract."

31:47.400 --> 31:51.320
Well, I'm sorry, something has gone very, very wrong

31:51.320 --> 31:58.520
when the United States army cannot recognize the exhaustion and depletion of one of its own.

31:58.520 --> 32:07.180
Well, then its contract becomes pernicious, reckless, ruthless and limitless, and therefore unconscionable.

32:07.180 --> 32:09.760
That is our contention here today.

32:12.070 --> 32:13.480
Thank you, Your Honor.

32:14.760 --> 32:19.330
Okay, Little Chicken, now that you've had your first night of Jewishness, what have you learned?

32:21.560 --> 32:25.000
That God blesses every family regardless of religion?

32:25.000 --> 32:29.550
And that Hanukkah can be as much fun as Christmas, which is my favorite holiday again.

32:29.550 --> 32:30.230
Oh?

32:30.230 --> 32:31.320
Oh, is that right?

32:31.320 --> 32:34.040
Now is that because it's coming up soon?

32:34.040 --> 32:34.940
Maybe.

32:41.570 --> 32:42.190
Mom?

32:42.190 --> 32:43.240
Mm-hmm?

32:43.240 --> 32:45.580
Why did I get diabetes?

32:46.140 --> 32:47.300
Was I bad?

32:47.300 --> 32:49.070
Oh, no.

32:49.070 --> 32:52.080
No, baby, it doesn't work like that.

32:52.080 --> 32:56.950
Bad things happen, but we have each other, and we always will.

32:57.960 --> 32:59.210
You have to have faith.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.090
I have faith that I'll get better.

33:03.730 --> 33:06.540
Oh, babe, it'll get easier, but...

33:07.320 --> 33:09.650
you're always gonna have diabetes.

33:10.200 --> 33:13.760
But I promise you, you will fight through it and you will get stronger,

33:13.760 --> 33:18.220
and you'll see the magic that you have, that your daddy and I have seen in you your whole life.

33:20.180 --> 33:23.380
I love you more than anything else in the world.

33:23.970 --> 33:25.230
Even more than Cooper?

33:25.230 --> 33:26.290
Oh!

33:26.460 --> 33:30.890
I have more love than both of you will ever need.

33:30.890 --> 33:32.230
Hmm?

33:34.400 --> 33:35.300
Hey.

33:35.300 --> 33:36.970
Hey. Come on in. Sit down.

33:36.970 --> 33:41.270
So, Whit, I, uh, I have been thinking about your job offer.

33:41.270 --> 33:43.300
Anything you wanna suggest, Kitty?

33:43.300 --> 33:44.250
A whole new ball game.

33:44.250 --> 33:46.650
"Red, White & Blue" isn't me.

33:46.650 --> 33:47.700
It's Warren.

33:47.700 --> 33:48.870
Don't say "no" to me.

33:48.870 --> 33:51.120
Go back out there and start this over.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.760
Warren believes in the show.

33:52.760 --> 33:53.630
He can carry it.

33:53.630 --> 33:55.320
He--he has a strong back.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.140
He doesn't need a foil.

33:56.140 --> 33:57.590
He doesn't even need talking points.

33:57.590 --> 34:00.690
He just--and he has this--he has this incredible integrity and

34:00.690 --> 34:02.070
he's also gotten smug.

34:02.070 --> 34:03.760
No, politicians have gotten smug.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.570
Politics has gotten smug.

34:05.570 --> 34:06.780
It's just...

34:07.570 --> 34:08.860
the times we live in.

34:09.070 --> 34:10.250
It's not the messenger.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.900
Say that on TV!

34:11.900 --> 34:13.850
Don't waste that on me.

34:13.850 --> 34:17.210
Listen to you-- the power to elevate the discussion.

34:17.210 --> 34:17.980
Look, I agree.

34:17.980 --> 34:18.989
- We have to change. 
- Whit.

34:18.989 --> 34:19.969
We have-- what?

34:19.969 --> 34:21.440
Just give it to Warren.

34:21.440 --> 34:22.340
He earned it.

34:22.340 --> 34:23.179
I didn't.

34:23.179 --> 34:24.870
And you don't want to have to convince me.

34:24.870 --> 34:26.239
Everyone wants me to convince them.

34:26.239 --> 34:29.010
No, but then you'll have to turn around and you'll have to fire me in a month,

34:29.010 --> 34:33.630
and that-- just-- just let me go so we can still love each other.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.230
Well, I've stopped loving you.

34:42.000 --> 34:49.860
Kitty, do something unexpected, would you, out there in the world?

34:51.570 --> 34:54.070
So this is my proposal.

34:55.239 --> 34:59.510
I'll sell you my share for half its value in cash.

34:59.510 --> 35:00.780
And?

35:02.430 --> 35:06.470
I want the other half in Ojai Foods stock.

35:07.210 --> 35:08.310
That's ridiculous.

35:08.330 --> 35:09.460
No way.

35:11.520 --> 35:13.140
Can I ask why?

35:13.770 --> 35:16.940
I watched William build this company, too.

35:17.330 --> 35:20.580
It was a part of my life--a big one.

35:21.300 --> 35:23.540
I want to be a part of this business.

35:26.020 --> 35:31.090
I was kept on the outside looking in for over 20 years.

35:31.090 --> 35:34.980
How could I not grow to care about what he was building here?

35:34.980 --> 35:36.130
Okay, that's enough.

35:36.130 --> 35:36.840
Please.

35:36.840 --> 35:38.730
Those are my terms.

35:39.260 --> 35:42.010
I presume you know absolutely nothing about business.

35:43.820 --> 35:48.660
And I find your desire for a half-posthumous work relationship with my father a little...

35:49.420 --> 35:50.590
creepy.

36:01.650 --> 36:04.040
So the ball is in your court.

36:05.420 --> 36:06.920
Let me know.

36:13.360 --> 36:14.450
All rise.

36:17.450 --> 36:18.560
Please be seated.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.070
Uh, Your Honor, if I may, I'd like to say something.

36:23.070 --> 36:24.390
Go ahead, Corporal.

36:24.390 --> 36:28.700
I think I've given the wrong impression, and I want to clear something up.

36:30.060 --> 36:31.430
I'm proud of what I've done.

36:33.240 --> 36:35.570
I'm proud to say I fought next to my friends.

36:37.910 --> 36:40.130
But what I'm not proud of is what I've done since.

36:41.610 --> 36:44.380
You see, my whole life, my family has been trying to help me.

36:45.820 --> 36:54.830
But the truth is, is I didn't want to be helped, and for the first time in my life, I want help.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.280
I want to fix myself.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.810
I don't want special attention.

37:02.240 --> 37:09.110
I have to face my responsibilities and accept them, and I'm working on it.

37:10.680 --> 37:12.730
It's a work in progress.

37:15.220 --> 37:16.320
Well, I guess that's it.

37:17.640 --> 37:18.090
I'm gonna...

37:18.090 --> 37:19.450
sit down.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.060
Thank you, Corporal.

37:25.020 --> 37:33.790
This court sympathizes with Corporal Walker's situation, unfortunately, that is immaterial.

37:34.640 --> 37:39.840
This is a military matter, and we find in favor of the Department of Defense.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.200
The plaintiff's motion is denied.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.240
Corporal Walker, you are to report as ordered.

37:45.240 --> 37:47.070
Court is adjourned.

37:50.980 --> 37:51.950
I'm so sorry, Bro.

37:51.950 --> 37:53.140
I am so sorry.

37:54.120 --> 37:55.640
I'm so sorry.

37:59.490 --> 38:00.380
Excuse me.

38:01.670 --> 38:02.710
Justin?

38:04.110 --> 38:05.820
I'm Brigadier General Hendricks.

38:05.820 --> 38:06.900
Hello, sir.

38:07.730 --> 38:11.890
Even though I disagreed with your conclusions, Mr. Walker, I found your arguments...

38:12.540 --> 38:14.110
very interesting, very...

38:15.210 --> 38:16.180
impassioned.

38:16.390 --> 38:17.660
Thank you.

38:21.290 --> 38:22.770
I'm giving you six months.

38:24.070 --> 38:25.240
I'm sorry, sir?

38:25.240 --> 38:27.710
You have six months to report.

38:28.300 --> 38:35.890
Get well, spend the time with your family, and when you report, be at peace with it.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.300
Thank you, sir.

38:37.300 --> 38:38.950
I, uh, don't know what to say

38:38.950 --> 38:41.420
and--and, uh, we certainly don't want to...

38:42.040 --> 38:45.140
change your mind, sir, but, wh--uh, why now?

38:47.620 --> 38:48.530
Let's just say...

38:51.140 --> 38:53.210
I had a brother, too, counselor.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.640
Merry Christmas.

38:57.820 --> 38:59.380
Merry Christmas, sir.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.290
God, tell me that just happened.

39:15.900 --> 39:16.910
Yeah, it did.

39:30.270 --> 39:31.270
This will be brief.

39:31.270 --> 39:33.470
We're going to buy our Christmas ornaments.

39:33.470 --> 39:35.440
I thought you did Hanukkah this year.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.340
Uh, we're doing both.

39:38.910 --> 39:40.440
You got yourself a deal.

39:40.440 --> 39:45.350
You'll get a check for half in a month, and you'll be officially a shareholder in Ojai Food.

39:45.350 --> 39:47.330
This is not what my father wanted.

39:47.650 --> 39:51.030
If he wanted you to be part of the company, he would've left you a share.

39:51.250 --> 39:53.210
I'll be civil, but I won't pretend.

39:54.600 --> 39:57.680
And your daughter never learns the identity of her father.

39:58.790 --> 40:00.470
Be smart, Sarah.

40:00.850 --> 40:02.680
Why would I tell her?

40:04.820 --> 40:05.700
Okay.

40:06.140 --> 40:08.380
I don't know how my mom's gonna deal with this.

40:08.380 --> 40:10.500
You don't give her enough credit.

40:11.730 --> 40:13.960
Welcome to the family business.

40:30.320 --> 40:31.220
Light the lights.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.400
Light them with Paige.

40:32.400 --> 40:33.450
Okay. There it is.

40:33.450 --> 40:34.260
Ready?

40:34.260 --> 40:35.780
Okay.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.210
Hey.

40:39.210 --> 40:39.980
How did it go?

40:39.980 --> 40:41.050
What happened?

40:41.880 --> 40:43.140
We got six more months.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.310
Oh!
