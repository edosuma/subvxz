00:09.980 --> 00:11.480
Hey, you guys want to see something funny?

00:11.490 --> 00:13.900
Oh, if this is where you lift your shirt up.

00:13.900 --> 00:16.590
And make your belly button
sing... no, thank you.

00:16.590 --> 00:20.250
Even better. Check out this
video I made of Charlie.

00:23.530 --> 00:25.610
<i>Being a baby stinks.</i>

00:25.610 --> 00:28.290
<i>Food's too mushy,</i>
<i>gross and too juicy,</i>

00:28.290 --> 00:31.670
<i>And the tv shows</i> <i>they make
me watch</i> <i>are insulting.</i>

00:33.310 --> 00:35.320
<i>Ahh, much better.</i>

00:35.320 --> 00:38.030
<i>Life is good.</i>

00:38.030 --> 00:41.140
P.J., you are gonna have to put
that online so grandma can see it.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.050
Grandma knows how to go online?

00:43.050 --> 00:45.590
P.J., you're gonna have to put that on a d.
V.D. So grandma can watch it.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.670
Grandma got
a d.V.D. Player?

00:47.670 --> 00:50.310
Okay, p.J., you're just gonna have
to go over to grandma's house.

00:50.310 --> 00:52.450
And act it out for her.

Okay, where is the library?

01:52.770 --> 01:57.680
Donde esta la libraria?

02:00.150 --> 02:02.450
Okay, you're really cute
when you roll your rs,

02:02.450 --> 02:04.520
But it's "biblioteca."

02:04.530 --> 02:07.160
- Biblioteca.
- But say "libraria" again.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.900
Libraria.

02:11.470 --> 02:15.910
Your rrrs make me all Mmm.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.090
Hey, listen, I want to ask you something.

02:18.090 --> 02:19.920
Ooh, that sounds interesting.
What is it?

02:19.920 --> 02:21.560
Well...

02:29.470 --> 02:31.580
Gabe, do you mind?

02:31.580 --> 02:33.450
No, you can stay.

02:35.190 --> 02:37.120
Let's go upstairs.

02:37.120 --> 02:39.130
Good idea.
I was gonna say something,

02:39.130 --> 02:41.560
But I didn't want to be rude.

02:45.300 --> 02:48.040
Okay, now what did you want to ask me?

02:48.040 --> 02:49.580
I was wondering if...

02:49.580 --> 02:52.950
- It was embarrassing.
- It was a simple question.

02:52.950 --> 02:55.590
Your father shouts at me
from two aisles away,

02:55.590 --> 02:58.030
"hey, ames, what kind
of toilet paper you like...

02:58.030 --> 03:00.200
Quilted or
super-quilted?"

03:01.100 --> 03:03.300
Hey, look, Spencer's here.

03:04.670 --> 03:06.580
So what, the world doesn't know.

03:06.580 --> 03:09.880
That the great Amy Duncan
uses toilet paper?

03:09.880 --> 03:12.420
Nice to see you,
Mr. And Mrs. Duncan.

03:12.420 --> 03:16.060
After all that shouting,
you got the wrong kind.

03:16.060 --> 03:20.700
Well, that's because I'm not
Bob the toilet paper psychic.

03:21.570 --> 03:24.240
Right this way.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.410
Well, on the bright side,

03:26.410 --> 03:30.420
You got the wrong trash bags too.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.890
Sorry about my parents.

03:31.890 --> 03:34.990
Wow, I say that a lot.

03:34.990 --> 03:37.330
So what I wanted to ask you was...

03:37.330 --> 03:40.430
I'm gonna get you!
I'm gonna get you!

03:40.440 --> 03:42.870
Yes, I am.
Yes, I am.

03:42.870 --> 03:44.610
Yes, I am.

03:46.540 --> 03:48.510
Okay, let's go outside.

03:48.510 --> 03:50.940
It usually takes him a while to get her.

03:55.310 --> 03:57.450
Okay, I think I'm all out
of family members,

03:57.450 --> 03:58.780
But you'd better talk fast.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.680
Okay, I was wondering.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.580
If you would wear my
football Jersey on Friday.

04:02.580 --> 04:05.390
It's sort of a tradition
that the players' girlfriends.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.420
Wear their jerseys on game day.

04:07.420 --> 04:10.320
So that would make me.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.790
Your girlfriend?

04:12.790 --> 04:14.660
- Yeah.
- Cool.

04:14.660 --> 04:16.800
Because I wasn't exactly sure of our status.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.600
And I was too nervous to ask.
And I didn't want to be one of those girls.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.170
That made you talk about it.
But then again...

04:21.170 --> 04:24.000
So that's a yes on the Jersey?

04:25.040 --> 04:27.710
Of course it's a yes, boyfriend.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.950
Back to the store,

04:33.950 --> 04:37.520
Where the correct answer
was super-quilted!

04:39.000 --> 04:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here

04:47.530 --> 04:51.060
Whoa, this is amazing.
That Charlie video has gone viral.

04:51.060 --> 04:52.590
What does that mean?

04:52.590 --> 04:55.800
That it's gotten a million
hits since last Tuesday.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.800
And now I'll answer your next question.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.130
That means over a million
people have seen it.

05:00.130 --> 05:04.870
So what, you put that on the facetube?

05:07.300 --> 05:11.000
Yeah, that's right, dad...
the facetube.

05:12.670 --> 05:15.680
I'm gonna be on tv.

05:15.680 --> 05:18.280
- What?
- The channel 8 news just called.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.510
And now that this video
is allver the Internet,

05:20.510 --> 05:24.850
They want to do an exclusive
on the "farty charlie" family.

05:24.850 --> 05:27.190
So we're all gonna b.

05:27.190 --> 05:28.750
That's what I meant.

05:35.090 --> 05:37.130
And this is our family room.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.500
Your family what?

05:38.500 --> 05:40.870
Our family rrroom.

05:42.570 --> 05:44.500
Oh, it's so nice and peaceful here.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.570
Well, it's a big house
and it's just me, mom and dad.

05:47.570 --> 05:50.100
Oh, how wonderful.

05:51.370 --> 05:53.040
Mom, dad, this is Teddy.

05:53.040 --> 05:55.640
Hi, nice to meet you,
Mr. And Mrs. Walsh.

05:55.640 --> 05:58.280
Oh, please, I'm Linda.
This is Paul.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.480
Spencer has told us so much about you.

06:00.480 --> 06:02.110
You're even prettier than he said.

06:02.110 --> 06:03.580
Dad, stop.

06:03.580 --> 06:06.380
Oh, no, it's okay.
I don't mind being pretty.

06:06.380 --> 06:08.320
Oh, Spence, before I forget,

06:08.320 --> 06:10.590
Your mom did the cutest
thing in the store today.

06:10.590 --> 06:13.490
She pointed out an eggplant
in the shape of a heart.

06:13.490 --> 06:15.660
And said it remded her of me.

06:15.660 --> 06:17.360
Well, it did.

06:17.360 --> 06:21.260
They must shop at a different
store than my parents.

06:21.260 --> 06:24.760
Well, let me put these away and
I'll fix you kids a quick snack.

06:27.130 --> 06:29.470
Oh, that's a beautiful guitar.

06:29.470 --> 06:32.840
Oh, thank you. I picked this
up on our last trip to Spain.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.170
Do you mind if I play?

06:35.180 --> 06:36.740
No, go ahead.

06:36.740 --> 06:40.680
Yeah, my brother...
he plays guitar and he...

06:40.680 --> 06:43.850
Sounds nothing like that.
Oh, that is so pretty.

06:43.850 --> 06:47.020
Thank you.
Teddy, have a seat, relax.

06:47.020 --> 06:49.120
Okay.

06:52.390 --> 06:56.660
Oh, massage chair.

06:56.660 --> 06:59.460
Ni-I-I-ce.

07:00.900 --> 07:03.930
Smoked salmon and dill on toast points.

07:03.930 --> 07:05.030
That's a snack?

07:05.030 --> 07:06.930
I dabble in the culinary arts.

07:06.930 --> 07:09.940
Mm, you more than dabble in that.

07:11.570 --> 07:15.110
Oh wait, can I have one more?

07:15.110 --> 07:17.710
You want to start studying?

07:17.710 --> 07:20.740
In a mi-I-inute.

07:26.610 --> 07:28.980
Well, I'm not surprised.
Once you're on top,

07:28.980 --> 07:31.820
They just want to knock you down.

07:31.820 --> 07:33.750
What are you talking about?

07:33.750 --> 07:36.820
Listen to some of these comments
about the Charlie video.

07:36.820 --> 07:39.090
Fred r5178 says,

07:39.090 --> 07:42.830
"cute, but you got lucky,
one-hit wonder."

07:42.830 --> 07:46.460
Here's another one... "you're a
pathetic, no-talent loser!"

07:46.460 --> 07:49.630
With about 19 exclamation points.

07:49.630 --> 07:53.470
That one's from Gabe d.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.270
Who are these people?

07:56.270 --> 07:58.970
There's no way to know.

08:03.510 --> 08:05.180
Gabe honey, come here.

08:05.180 --> 08:08.610
I want to show you something
very exciting from mommy's past.

08:08.610 --> 08:11.020
Teddy told me if I ever heard those words,

08:11.020 --> 08:13.180
I should just keep walking.

08:13.190 --> 08:14.880
Park it.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.920
Now in preparation for
our television appearance

08:18.920 --> 08:20.890
I'm studying some of my
previous broadcast work.

08:20.890 --> 08:22.830
I used to be a reporter.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.060
For the southwest Denver community college.

08:25.060 --> 08:27.630
Action news team.

08:27.630 --> 08:32.270
We reached dozens of viewers
all across the country.

08:32.270 --> 08:35.539
This is one of my
hardest-hitting pieces.

08:35.539 --> 08:37.740
In my hand I'm holding.

08:37.740 --> 08:39.799
Something new to our campus...

08:39.809 --> 08:41.710
A cell phone.

08:41.710 --> 08:44.270
"cell" is short for "cellular"

08:44.280 --> 08:45.640
<i>Believe it or not,</i>

08:45.640 --> 08:49.410
You can use this phone wherever you go.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.980
I know it sounds crazy,

08:53.990 --> 08:56.190
But as Paula abdul would say,

08:56.190 --> 08:59.320
"I'm tellin' ya
straight up."

09:03.630 --> 09:06.230
It was good.
It was really good.

09:10.530 --> 09:13.740
- Oh, unbelievable. - Are you kidding me?
That's the worst throw!

09:13.740 --> 09:15.640
Hi.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.740
Hey, Teddy.
Hey, what you got there?

09:17.740 --> 09:19.840
Leftovers from Spencer's house.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.810
Come on!

09:23.810 --> 09:25.810
I can't watch this.
I'm turning it off.

09:25.810 --> 09:28.380
No no, wait wait.
The commercial with the talking foot.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.920
<i>Dinner!</i>

09:37.460 --> 09:40.020
Grab your buns.
It's sloppy Joe night.

09:40.020 --> 09:42.030
Mom just said,
"grab your buns."

09:42.030 --> 09:45.800
- Teddy.
- I'm fine, thank you.

09:45.800 --> 09:49.070
- Ooh, what are you having?
- Toast points with salmon and dill.

09:49.070 --> 09:53.070
Toast points?
I say what's-the-points.

09:54.570 --> 09:56.270
Hey, check out Charlie.

09:58.810 --> 10:01.280
She put sloppy Joe on her face.

10:01.280 --> 10:03.980
Because she's a baby.
What's so funny?

10:03.980 --> 10:06.920
It's not just funny 'cause she's a baby.

10:07.920 --> 10:12.020
See, this works on all ages.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.560
Now Gabe, you know that's not right.

10:14.560 --> 10:16.660
Yeah, it should be more like this.

10:16.660 --> 10:20.830
Okay, all right, all right, cut it out.

10:20.830 --> 10:23.830
Next person who throws sloppy Joe...

10:26.170 --> 10:28.740
Guys, you know, at Spencer's house.

10:28.740 --> 10:31.740
The food goes directly from
their plates to their mouths.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.910
How is that fun?

10:33.910 --> 10:36.880
I'll let you know tomorrow night because
I'm going over there for dinner.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.110
His mom is making quail.
Not sloppy quail... quail.

10:40.110 --> 10:42.450
You can't go over there tomorrow night.

10:42.450 --> 10:45.080
The channel 8 news crew is coming over.
They're gonna interview the whole family.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.780
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

10:46.790 --> 10:48.520
What, you don't want to be on tv with me?

10:48.520 --> 10:51.250
- Us.
- Us?

10:51.250 --> 10:54.890
No, I don't want to be a part
of the "farty charlie" family.

10:54.890 --> 10:56.150
It's embarrassing.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.160
It's embarrassing.

10:58.160 --> 11:02.330
Or we're embarrassing?

11:02.330 --> 11:05.460
Yes.

11:06.860 --> 11:09.370
- More for us.
- Yep.

11:14.440 --> 11:18.780
Nobody calls p.J. Duncan
a one-hit wonder.

11:19.920 --> 11:23.350
Behold "farty Charlie ii."

11:29.890 --> 11:33.890
Hey, I'm Charlie.
I'm feeling extra gassy today.

11:33.890 --> 11:35.790
Uh-oh, here comes.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.270
<i>Ahh, that's better.</i>

11:47.770 --> 11:51.270
So what do you think?

11:51.270 --> 11:53.610
Where do I begin?

11:53.610 --> 11:56.440
That wasn't even Charlie.
That was a doll.

11:56.440 --> 11:59.610
Because Charlie had to take a nap.

11:59.610 --> 12:02.250
Plus, you can only tell
'cause you're her brother.

12:02.250 --> 12:05.580
No, I could tell because her foot
was facing the wrong direction.

12:05.580 --> 12:08.690
Well, did you like anything about it?

12:08.690 --> 12:11.320
Well, I liked...

12:11.320 --> 12:13.260
No.

12:13.260 --> 12:17.260
Man, the people are right.
I am a one-hit wonder.

12:17.260 --> 12:19.590
Look, you had a good run.

12:19.600 --> 12:21.700
30 seconds?

12:21.700 --> 12:25.130
Look, I'm trying to put
lipstick on a pig here.

12:25.130 --> 12:27.400
You're a failure.

12:28.670 --> 12:31.440
Lipstick on a pig...
that's hilarious.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.040
I just got an idea for my next film.

12:35.670 --> 12:37.140
If anyone needs me,

12:37.140 --> 12:39.880
I'll be at the drugstore, then the zoo.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.520
Oh, honey, it's Teddy.
Where's Spence?

12:49.520 --> 12:51.690
Oh, he won't be back for a couple of hours.

12:51.690 --> 12:53.620
Oh, am I early?

12:53.620 --> 12:55.690
Did I accidentally come here too early.

12:55.690 --> 12:57.430
By mistake somehow?

12:57.430 --> 12:59.690
- It's fine.
- Because I could wait outside.

12:59.700 --> 13:03.760
Oh, don't be silly. Go on, have a seat.
Make yourself at home.

13:03.770 --> 13:05.200
Oh, does that one vibrate too?

13:05.200 --> 13:07.700
- No, just that one.
- Oh.

13:07.700 --> 13:10.200
Would you prefer that one?

13:10.200 --> 13:12.940
Hey, there's an idea.

13:17.240 --> 13:19.240
So how are you, dear?

13:19.240 --> 13:22.210
Well, now that you ask,

13:22.210 --> 13:24.410
I'm a little snacky.

13:26.580 --> 13:29.280
Ahh.

13:37.060 --> 13:41.660
P.J. Duncan, director;
This is Gabe, entourage.

13:41.660 --> 13:43.860
Hi, I'm Rick Coleman, channel 8 news.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.660
Listen, I've got a lot of
exciting new projects coming up,

13:46.670 --> 13:49.400
So if you could mention the
words "pig" or "lipstick,"

13:49.400 --> 13:52.370
You might get yourself an exclusive.

13:54.670 --> 13:58.210
Hi, this is Charlie.
I'm Bob.

13:58.210 --> 13:59.840
Of "bob's bugs be gone."

13:59.840 --> 14:01.510
Yeah. You've seen
my trucks around town?

14:01.510 --> 14:03.110
And the big bug on your shirt.

14:03.110 --> 14:06.280
Oh, didn't even realize I was wearing this.

14:06.280 --> 14:09.420
Or that she's wearing the exact same shirt.

14:09.420 --> 14:12.590
Hey, what do you know?

14:15.490 --> 14:18.020
Hi, everybody.

14:18.020 --> 14:21.030
I'm Amy, Charlie's mom.

14:21.030 --> 14:25.100
And former anchor for
"good morning campus today."

14:25.100 --> 14:27.030
Listen, if you run into any problems.

14:27.030 --> 14:29.130
During your segment, just throw it to me.

14:29.130 --> 14:31.670
I'll be your
go-to gal.

14:33.270 --> 14:35.640
Honey, have you rehearsed what you're
gonna say about your business?

14:35.640 --> 14:37.410
Rehearsed?
I'm just gonna wing it.

14:37.410 --> 14:40.040
No no, Bob, you're not
very good at winging it.

14:40.040 --> 14:42.680
Remember your wedding vows?

14:42.680 --> 14:45.680
"I like her."

14:45.680 --> 14:48.120
Honey, I was a little nervous.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.450
And that was a long time ago.
I'm gonna be fine.

14:51.450 --> 14:54.290
Hey, mom, you have something on your face.

14:54.290 --> 14:56.290
- Oh, where?
- Everywhere.

14:58.090 --> 15:00.990
Honey, you need to wear
a lot of makeup on television.

15:00.990 --> 15:03.860
So that you're not washed out
under all the lights.

15:03.860 --> 15:07.900
The kids don't know this because
they're not in the media arts.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.200
I don't know how long it's been.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.200
Since you've been in the media arts,

15:12.200 --> 15:14.300
But with hi-def
you don't need a lot of light.

15:14.300 --> 15:18.570
Oh, well, how will
my makeup look in hi-def?

15:18.580 --> 15:21.940
Should be interesting.

15:21.940 --> 15:24.810
Okay, let's do this.

15:24.810 --> 15:26.650
This is Rick Coleman,

15:26.650 --> 15:28.650
And I'm here with Denver's newest celebrity.

15:28.650 --> 15:32.220
Who's been seen by, well, pretty
much everyone with a computer.

15:32.220 --> 15:34.290
She's cute.
She's funny.

15:34.290 --> 15:36.760
She's farty Charlie!

15:36.760 --> 15:38.890
Back to you, Rick.

15:44.530 --> 15:47.470
And here we are on our family
reunion last summer in Aspen.

15:47.470 --> 15:49.030
You were staying in a lodge?

15:49.040 --> 15:50.670
No, that's our cabin.

15:50.670 --> 15:52.570
Our lodge is on the other
side of our mountain.

15:52.570 --> 15:56.210
Dad, stop. You're making
us sound like we're rich.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.110
We don't have our own mountain.

15:58.110 --> 16:02.110
We share it with another family.

16:02.110 --> 16:05.650
Speaking of families, Teddy, when
are we gonna get to meet yours?

16:05.650 --> 16:08.280
Uh, they're kind of busy,

16:08.280 --> 16:10.620
So maybe next summer.

16:10.620 --> 16:13.390
Or the one after that.

16:13.390 --> 16:15.890
Okay, everyone, I have
the news on in the kitchen.

16:15.890 --> 16:17.660
You have got to see these people.

16:17.660 --> 16:20.190
And when they saw
what great work I was doing.

16:20.190 --> 16:22.730
<i>Out in the field,</i> <i>they said,</i>

16:22.730 --> 16:25.930
"hey, we need her on
'good morning campus today.'"

16:25.930 --> 16:28.170
Rick, you might say.

16:28.170 --> 16:30.700
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.

16:32.370 --> 16:34.340
If we could get back to Charlie...

16:34.340 --> 16:36.540
Why don't we talk to the proud papa?

16:36.540 --> 16:38.270
Whew.

16:38.280 --> 16:42.280
Whoa, look, dad, you're sweating
right through your shirt.

16:44.750 --> 16:46.150
Uh...

16:46.150 --> 16:47.880
You know, Rick,

16:47.880 --> 16:49.720
Something I find very interesting.

16:49.720 --> 16:53.420
Is that cell phones have
gotten so much smaller.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.090
Back to you, Rick.

16:57.090 --> 17:00.160
So, pj, you're the director
of this little epic.

17:00.160 --> 17:02.830
That's right, rick... director,
writer, editor and voice.

17:02.830 --> 17:04.730
I don't know what a producer does,

17:04.730 --> 17:06.530
But I probably did that too.

17:09.170 --> 17:10.839
What are you doing?

17:10.839 --> 17:13.270
Well, you just give it to me
and I'll throw it back to you.

17:13.270 --> 17:14.869
No, let go.

17:14.869 --> 17:16.970
At least let me throw it back
to yolanda in the studio.

17:16.970 --> 17:20.180
No, I do that.
Back to yolanda in the studio.

17:20.180 --> 17:22.780
What is wrong with you people?

17:24.079 --> 17:27.450
I thought you'd enjoy that.

17:27.450 --> 17:29.780
You have no idea.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.190
What a family.
The woman...

17:32.190 --> 17:34.450
She looks like a circus clown.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.060
Clowns are fun.

17:36.060 --> 17:38.320
What about the big sweaty oaf?
He was a piece of work.

17:38.330 --> 17:40.530
Oafs are fun.

17:40.530 --> 17:43.060
Where did they find these people?

17:43.060 --> 17:46.630
Mom, dad, stop, okay?
That's Teddy's family.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.330
That's a good one, Spence.

17:50.340 --> 17:52.870
No, he's not kidding.

17:52.870 --> 17:56.070
Oh, but Teddy, you're
nothing like those people.

17:56.070 --> 17:58.340
You're so poised and sophisticated and...

18:03.410 --> 18:04.610
Excuse me?

18:04.610 --> 18:07.410
I said...

18:08.950 --> 18:12.990
I can do that because I'm a Duncan.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.250
I'm the product.

18:14.250 --> 18:18.260
Of the sweaty oaf and the crazy clown.

18:18.260 --> 18:21.620
Oh Teddy, I'm sorry.
We didn't know.

18:21.630 --> 18:25.530
Oh, no no, it's okay.
Yesterday I was embarrassed by them too.

18:25.530 --> 18:27.900
And I even told them that.
And then I came over here.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.900
So I could pretend that I was one of you.

18:29.900 --> 18:32.700
But I'm not.
I'm one of them.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.070
I sweat, I fart and I burp.

18:36.070 --> 18:38.540
You're not gonna do that again, are you?

18:38.540 --> 18:40.710
No.

18:40.710 --> 18:43.440
In fact, I should probably
get back to my family.

18:43.440 --> 18:46.210
In this, their darkest hour.

18:54.690 --> 18:56.990
- Paul!
- Oh, I'm sorry, dear.

18:56.990 --> 18:59.320
I just wanted to see
how the other half lives.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.030
Oh.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.060
Oh, man.

19:07.060 --> 19:10.170
Hey, Charlie, so everyone except
for me was on the news tonight,

19:10.170 --> 19:12.500
And now they're all watching
it on the Internet.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.140
That's right...
the Duncans have gone viral.

19:16.140 --> 19:19.070
Oh my gosh I look like a clown.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.510
Well, at least you talked.

19:21.510 --> 19:24.510
And talked and talked...

19:24.510 --> 19:25.880
Hey.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.850
I look cool.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.950
See, that's the great thing
about this family...

19:31.950 --> 19:33.880
We can laugh at ourselves.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.890
And hopefully you feel the same way.

19:35.890 --> 19:37.890
When you're older and realize

19:37.890 --> 19:41.220
"everyone in the world
has seen me pass gas."

19:43.230 --> 19:45.430
I'll get it.

19:49.600 --> 19:51.500
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:51.500 --> 19:54.400
I just wanted to make sure you were okay.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.870
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:58.870 --> 20:01.410
I'm so sorry about my parents.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.310
Wow, it is really nice.

20:03.310 --> 20:05.880
To hear that coming out of
somebody else's mouth.

20:05.880 --> 20:08.950
I was thinking maybe tomorrow
we could study here.

20:08.950 --> 20:10.520
It's a lot more fun than my house.

20:10.520 --> 20:13.220
Really? Or are you just
saying that to be nice?

20:13.220 --> 20:15.550
No, I mean it.
It's always so quiet at my house.

20:15.550 --> 20:17.550
Over here it's loud and fun.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.420
And full of different smells.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.390
Okay, my house it is.

20:25.400 --> 20:27.200
Any chance of a sloppy Joe night?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.230
Oh, it'll be a sloppy something night.

20:29.230 --> 20:31.030
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.230
Oh hey, hold on a sec.

20:34.940 --> 20:37.870
Hey, Charlie, this is my boyfriend Spencer.

20:37.870 --> 20:39.210
Hi, Charlie.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.680
Isn't he cute?

20:40.680 --> 20:43.040
I hope someday you find
somebody as great as him,

20:43.050 --> 20:45.910
But it might be tough.
So good luck, Charlie.

20:47.420 --> 20:49.920
Uh, nuh-uh.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.570
Oh, father, that was lovely.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.770
Your finger-picking
is so delicate.

21:13.770 --> 21:16.440
Almost as delicate as that pomegranate.

21:16.440 --> 21:18.380
That you're painting, dear.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.110
Dinner in 15 minutes.

21:22.120 --> 21:25.590
Tonight we're having coq au
vin and white asparagus.

21:25.590 --> 21:29.920
Oh my, I still have on my afternoon pearls.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.390
Mother, the table is set.

21:34.390 --> 21:36.630
How else may I help you?

21:36.630 --> 21:42.170
Father, the horses
have been groomed and fed.

21:48.210 --> 21:51.910
It would seem our child is full of beans.

21:54.210 --> 21:56.710
Father, how you make us titter.
