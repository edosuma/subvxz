[Indistinct voices]

02:58.240 --> 03:01.118
[Magruder] When you DA geniuses
gonna learn that logic

03:01.200 --> 03:03.475
runs a distant second
to God, country and colour?

03:04.320 --> 03:07.312
That's why I vacation
in the Canary Islands

03:07.400 --> 03:10.551
and your news comes from
the bottom of a birdcage.

03:10.640 --> 03:13.996
[Terry on phone] You took
a 20-year vet to pieces.

03:14.080 --> 03:15.991
[Magruder] He blew procedure,
suppressed evidence.

03:16.080 --> 03:20.232
C'mon, Terry. I support
cops, but there are rules.

03:20.320 --> 03:23.357
- [Terry] What about morality?
- Morality? In law?

03:23.440 --> 03:26.637
Who told you that? The lawyer
fairy? I protect my client.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.918
I don't know about you or the
cops, Terry, but I'm movin' on.

03:31.000 --> 03:33.992
So you push for civil,
I'll see you in court.

[Phone bleeps]

03:41.280 --> 03:43.396
[TV] Noted Georgia Defence
Attorney, Rick Magruder,

03:43.480 --> 03:47.075
argued that police posing as
drug dealers were overzealous...

03:47.160 --> 03:50.197
I told you not to leave
those on the sofa.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.679
The phone in here?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.512
[Boy]
We're watching Dad on TV.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.874
[Phone rings]

03:57.880 --> 03:58.835
Hello?

03:58.920 --> 04:00.592
[On phone]
Betty, it's Mr Magruder.

04:00.680 --> 04:02.910
- How are the kids?
- Fine.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.319
I'm just fixing their...

04:04.400 --> 04:05.958
My gosh, you're on TV!

04:06.040 --> 04:08.554
[Magruder] We must've done
pretty well today.

04:08.640 --> 04:09.675
Is Leeanne around?

04:09.760 --> 04:11.352
No, Mr Alden picked her up.

04:11.440 --> 04:12.998
[Magruder]
Mr Alden, huh?

04:13.080 --> 04:15.036
Kids, your daddy's
on the phone.

04:17.720 --> 04:18.914
Hi, Dad.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.956
[Magruder]
How you doin', darlin'?

04:21.040 --> 04:24.555
OK. The guy on TV says
you're a snake-oil salesman

04:24.640 --> 04:27.108
and I told Jeff you're
a lawyer, right?

04:27.200 --> 04:30.033
[Magruder] You don't believe
everything on TV, do you?

04:30.120 --> 04:32.270
No, guess not.
I told you, Jeff!

04:32.360 --> 04:34.351
Daddy said he's still a lawyer.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.078
But Dad's still on TV.

04:37.560 --> 04:39.710
[Magruder]
Hey, you guys, quit fightin'!

04:39.800 --> 04:42.030
OK, I love you both.
See you tomorrow, OK?

04:42.680 --> 04:43.635
[Libby]
Bye, Dad!

04:43.720 --> 04:44.835
Yeah, bye, honey.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.154
[Phone beeps]

04:47.240 --> 04:48.673
[Woman]
Dunson, Hess and Magruder?

04:48.760 --> 04:50.716
Hey, Konnie, it's Rick.
Put Lois on.

04:50.800 --> 04:53.030
Yes, Mr Magruder.
One second, please.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.190
Lois?
[Whispers] It's Rick.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.629
Well,
if it isn't the golden boy!

05:01.720 --> 05:04.188
I just saw you
on the six o'clock.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.633
Why'd you wear that tie?

05:05.720 --> 05:07.756
[Magruder]
That tie's good luck.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.796
[Lois]
Are you coming by here?

05:09.880 --> 05:13.111
You read my mind. How's dinner
at the Pink House sound?

05:13.200 --> 05:16.078
[Lois] Ricky, I'd love to,
but we're swamped here.

05:16.160 --> 05:17.912
But swing by
for something later.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.558
- [Magruder] I'll come by, Lo.
- All right.

05:50.360 --> 05:51.793
Shh! Shh! Shh!

05:57.320 --> 05:59.276
They ever gonna fix this door?

05:59.360 --> 06:00.679
Congratulations, Rick.

06:00.760 --> 06:01.954
[Cheers and applause]

06:02.040 --> 06:03.598
What is this?

06:04.760 --> 06:06.671
- [Magruder] Was this you?
- [Lois] Sorry,

06:06.760 --> 06:09.672
I wanted to say,
but they made me swear.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.758
Let me take your stuff.

06:13.440 --> 06:14.998
[Magruder]
Is this all for me?

06:15.080 --> 06:17.230
- I don't drink champagne.
- I got yours.

06:17.720 --> 06:18.994
You are a psychic.

06:20.320 --> 06:23.039
What are you doin' here?
Good to see you.

06:23.120 --> 06:24.394
I appreciate it.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.711
Who are all these people?
Do I know all these people?

06:28.640 --> 06:29.834
Well, look who's here!

06:29.920 --> 06:31.148
You didn't wear that...

06:31.240 --> 06:33.515
I wore... I knew you'd
mention this suit.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.635
Well, it worked.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.395
I wanna tell you, you did a
superb job in Jacksonville.

06:38.480 --> 06:41.677
Savannah lawyers haven't won a
case down there in 10 years.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.510
In 10 years?

06:42.600 --> 06:45.114
[Magruder] Oh, Judge Winslow
sends his regards.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.479
[Magruder]
Hey, Lo!

06:48.120 --> 06:49.519
You put her up to this?

06:49.600 --> 06:51.795
Lois, this is his night.
His night.

06:51.880 --> 06:53.916
I know.
We'll take care of him.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.036
- Enjoy.
- Thanks. Thanks for this.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.473
It's a good surprise.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.393
- You all right?
- We have to do this?

07:03.560 --> 07:06.120
Oh, boy. Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.519
Why is she here?

07:09.560 --> 07:12.393
I'll... I'll see you later.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.315
Thanks.

07:15.240 --> 07:15.911
Hey, Leeanne!

07:16.640 --> 07:18.392
Oh, congratulations, Rick.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.357
- Lipstick, there.
- Thank you.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.908
Hey, Carl. I thought
I recognised that Lincoln.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.592
Yes, isn't she a beauty?

07:24.680 --> 07:27.558
Yeah, didn't spoil the surprise,
but the licence plate's obvious.

07:27.640 --> 07:30.279
It's clever, you're an attorney
and it says attorney...

07:30.360 --> 07:32.316
- Self-defence?
- Works every time.

07:32.400 --> 07:33.753
Everyone's very happy for you.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.831
- Well...
- You worked hard.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.955
We got lucky.

07:37.040 --> 07:39.759
A marvellous knack
for making cops look rotten.

07:39.840 --> 07:43.469
Law says we've all gotta play by
the rules, Carl. You know that.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.916
I bet that's exactly what you
told the jury, wasn't it?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.468
We lay it out,
let 'em do the right thing.

07:49.560 --> 07:50.913
So why didn't they?

07:53.120 --> 07:54.997
I'll get us some more drinks?

07:55.080 --> 07:59.631
All right, I'd love another
Bacardi and cranberry, thanks.

07:59.720 --> 08:00.994
Thanks, honey.

08:01.080 --> 08:02.195
Yeah. Thanks, honey.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.235
[Sighs]

08:03.320 --> 08:04.673
Er, no, thank you.

08:07.240 --> 08:10.118
So, I thought you'd
given up on attorneys?

08:10.200 --> 08:13.078
Well, everyone's got
their thing.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.752
Is that what it is?

08:15.840 --> 08:17.990
What do you call someone
addicted to attorneys?

08:18.280 --> 08:19.315
Stupid?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.878
At least he's a divorce lawyer,
not a criminal.

08:23.960 --> 08:26.076
- Lawyer, that is.
- Don't start.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.594
That he was your
divorce lawyer is shitty,

08:28.680 --> 08:29.795
don't you think, Leeanne?

08:29.880 --> 08:32.758
Why are you here?
You wanna go through with this?

08:32.840 --> 08:35.195
Tomorrow,
what time for the kids?

08:36.039 --> 08:39.316
9:30. It's always 9:30,
why don't we make it 9:30?

08:40.280 --> 08:43.556
All right, do me a favour
and be on time, Rick.

08:44.880 --> 08:46.438
Carl? Er...

08:46.520 --> 08:48.238
Can I get another drink?

08:48.320 --> 08:51.153
- Jack, straight up?
- What am I gonna do?

08:51.240 --> 08:53.117
- That jerk.
- JD, please.

08:53.200 --> 08:56.556
Oh, boy. How she
picked him, I do not know.

08:56.640 --> 08:59.029
I try so hard, I really do.

08:59.120 --> 09:01.111
- I know, just...
- Every time I...

09:01.200 --> 09:02.349
Remember the carrot here...

09:02.440 --> 09:05.671
Fuck the carrot,
I have to put up with this crap.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.833
- Lose it with him now and...
- I know...

09:09.920 --> 09:11.911
Lose it now,
it'll cost you later.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.558
He just pisses me off.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.676
I understand that.
Let's forget about it.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.751
- Where's the car?
- Down here.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.671
One step, two steps...

09:19.760 --> 09:22.399
- What colour is it?
- It's green.

09:40.560 --> 09:43.632
Do you know what a fabulously
attractive woman you are?

09:43.720 --> 09:46.553
Why don't we leave here
and go have some dinner?

09:48.280 --> 09:51.909
That's the booze, Rick.
It makes you itch, remember?

09:53.280 --> 09:55.111
Well, we can scratch.

09:56.240 --> 09:58.071
You know better.

09:58.160 --> 09:59.991
If you don't, I do.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.275
It's what you pay me for.
Good judgement.

10:02.360 --> 10:06.114
Well, I got the kids tomorrow,
but I'll call in, so...

10:07.240 --> 10:09.435
One nightcap.
Something medicinal.

10:09.520 --> 10:13.638
I'll fix you one, but I've got
an hour or two to catch up.

10:42.240 --> 10:43.593
[Car horn]

10:43.680 --> 10:47.559
[Woman]
Hey, goddamit! That's my car!

10:47.640 --> 10:48.868
[Tyres screech]

10:50.320 --> 10:52.197
Jesus... Shit!

10:52.280 --> 10:53.315
[Magruder]
Somethin' wrong?

10:53.400 --> 10:56.312
Son of a bitch just
stole my fucking car!

10:56.400 --> 10:57.355
What, just now?

10:57.440 --> 10:59.158
Yeah, just now. Didn't you see?

10:59.240 --> 11:01.754
Well, maybe
we should call the police.

11:03.160 --> 11:07.039
Why? So they can make out
some goddamn report?

11:07.120 --> 11:10.351
Tell me to call my insurance
company, which I don't have,

11:10.440 --> 11:14.194
because I can't afford, and they
won't do a darn thing anyway.

11:14.280 --> 11:16.714
No, thanks. I been
through this shit before.

11:16.800 --> 11:19.075
Well, is there
anything I can do?

11:19.160 --> 11:20.957
Find me a new life.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.713
I'm gonna walk
to a phone booth...

11:23.800 --> 11:26.234
[Magruder]
I got a phone in the car.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.953
'Course you do.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.635
Listen, I'm on my way.
I could give you a ride.

11:33.040 --> 11:35.270
No, thanks. I just need a cab.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.920
Well, this time of night,
this weather,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.389
you gonna wait around forever.
Where'd you live?

11:42.600 --> 11:43.635
Across town.

11:43.720 --> 11:46.757
Well, I don't mind, really.
I'm just wired from today,

11:46.840 --> 11:50.355
so I could use the drive,
but, you know, whatever.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.152
I'll... I'll give you a ride.

12:07.320 --> 12:08.878
[Magruder] It's up here?

12:08.960 --> 12:11.679
It's down this road about...

12:11.760 --> 12:15.036
I don't know, three lights,
then turn right on Victory.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.111
It's a couple of miles
out of town.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.077
You like your job?

12:24.800 --> 12:29.078
It wasn't a lifelong ambition,
if that's what you're asking.

12:29.160 --> 12:30.832
I was just wonderin'.

12:30.920 --> 12:32.194
Pays the rent.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.596
Any news about Geraldo?

12:38.160 --> 12:39.309
TV guy?

12:40.280 --> 12:42.396
[Sighs]
The storm.

12:43.480 --> 12:45.789
I've had other things
on my mind.

12:48.320 --> 12:50.959
Just wondered whether
it was coming in.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.598
Boy, it's funny sometimes...

12:53.680 --> 12:57.639
You get so wrapped up in a case
you forget other things exist.

12:59.760 --> 13:01.079
Like what?

13:02.160 --> 13:04.116
Like storms.

13:16.480 --> 13:19.597
OK, now, at the end
of the street, turn right.

13:19.680 --> 13:21.033
[Magruder]
Turn right.

13:22.440 --> 13:23.429
Right here.

13:23.520 --> 13:24.669
Down the street or...?

13:24.760 --> 13:27.149
No, first house
on the right-hand side.

13:27.240 --> 13:28.593
[Magruder]
All right.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.511
[Magruder]
What is it?

13:49.600 --> 13:51.033
That's my car.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.033
The one that was stolen?

13:54.240 --> 13:55.593
Maybe it wasn't stolen.

13:55.680 --> 13:58.114
What do you mean?
You got a roommate?

13:58.200 --> 14:01.112
No, I live alone.
Thanks again for the ride.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.349
What do you mean?

14:07.960 --> 14:09.518
You forget to lock it?

14:11.640 --> 14:13.596
You want me to come in?

14:14.600 --> 14:16.238
For what? I'm fine.

14:16.320 --> 14:17.719
Well, I'm comin' in.

14:19.840 --> 14:20.875
Hello?

14:22.680 --> 14:25.035
[TV] Another probable
depression has developed...

14:28.040 --> 14:29.439
They your car keys?

14:35.120 --> 14:36.599
Anybody home?

14:42.280 --> 14:43.349
Hello?

15:28.400 --> 15:29.674
[Glass smashes]

15:33.800 --> 15:34.949
[Miaows]

15:38.880 --> 15:40.871
So what did I walk into here?

15:40.960 --> 15:44.111
Jealous boyfriend? Ex-husband?
Current husband?

15:44.200 --> 15:45.428
None of the above?

15:50.440 --> 15:51.634
My daddy.

15:51.720 --> 15:55.156
Your daddy? Your daddy stole
your car? Broke into your house?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.468
Any particular reason?

15:56.560 --> 15:58.471
He's just not well.

15:58.560 --> 15:59.913
What's wrong with him?

16:00.000 --> 16:02.753
There's nothing wrong with him,
I didn't say that.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.637
He just does weird
shit sometimes.

16:04.720 --> 16:06.438
How long's this been goin' on?

16:06.520 --> 16:07.748
Hey, you know what?

16:07.840 --> 16:11.879
You gave me a ride, swell, but
I don't wanna talk about this.

16:11.960 --> 16:15.032
Well, I think you should.
What is it he's doin'?

16:16.160 --> 16:17.388
He follows me.

16:17.480 --> 16:18.913
You mean stalks you?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.638
What's that, the legal word?

16:20.720 --> 16:21.675
Yeah, it is.

16:21.760 --> 16:23.716
- Then that's it.
- Why?

16:23.800 --> 16:26.553
I don't know,
he's in this group.

16:26.640 --> 16:31.031
It's not religious, they don't
believe the world's ending.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.634
They just got
some strange ideas.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.676
Well, this is not
rational behaviour.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.751
You gotta have somebody
talk to him.

16:37.840 --> 16:40.513
You sound like
everybody else here.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.158
Acting like it's so easy...

16:42.240 --> 16:43.832
I ain't sayin' it's easy,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.876
I'm just sayin' these
things escalate

16:45.960 --> 16:47.757
and easily become dangerous.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.637
You can make him get help.

16:49.720 --> 16:50.994
What do you mean?

16:51.080 --> 16:55.437
That if he's dangerous the state
can make him get checked out.

16:55.520 --> 16:56.919
There's no money for that.

16:57.000 --> 17:00.356
There doesn't have to be money.
You have an evaluation period.

17:00.440 --> 17:03.477
If he needs psychiatric help,
the court can order it!

17:03.560 --> 17:05.073
Courts can do shit for me!

17:05.160 --> 17:09.472
Get him on Lithium, Prozac. All
I'm saying is maybe that's...

17:09.560 --> 17:11.152
He ain't gonna get better!

17:11.240 --> 17:14.868
[Sobs]
My daddy ain't gonna get better.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.637
I'm sorry, I...

17:23.520 --> 17:26.353
I didn't mean to upset you.

17:36.360 --> 17:37.918
[Sobs]

17:38.000 --> 17:39.877
[Whispers]
It's all right. It's all right.

18:14.160 --> 18:15.832
[Cat miaows]

18:19.040 --> 18:20.758
Am I in your spot?

18:31.200 --> 18:32.713
Oh, Jesus!

18:44.200 --> 18:46.395
Come on, Leeanne.
'Course I didn't forget.

18:46.480 --> 18:50.189
I'm sorry. I was not screwing
around! I had a meeting!

18:50.280 --> 18:54.159
Why'd you always assume...?
I'll be with you in 15 minutes.

18:54.240 --> 18:55.468
Yeah, I'm comin'.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.036
[Childrens' voices]

19:04.120 --> 19:05.075
[Honks horn]

19:08.560 --> 19:11.393
Dad! You're late! Again!

19:12.400 --> 19:14.072
I'm sorry, darlin'.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.589
How are ya?

19:16.680 --> 19:18.033
I'm sorry, Jeff.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.509
In we go. Squeeze up.

19:22.600 --> 19:23.794
There you go.

19:24.240 --> 19:26.196
- You look like shit.
- Leeanne!

19:26.280 --> 19:28.271
- Forgot to shave.
- Don't start.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.749
Same shirt as last night,
isn't it?

19:30.840 --> 19:33.593
We're good to go.
Say goodbye to your mom.

19:33.680 --> 19:36.035
Bye-bye, angels.
I love you both.

19:43.800 --> 19:47.236
Listen, guys, I let go your
hands, will you behave?

19:47.320 --> 19:48.389
- Maybe!
- C'mon.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.550
Listen, you want anything?

19:51.920 --> 19:53.990
Just... Hey, listen.

19:54.080 --> 19:58.312
You want one of these wheel
things? OK, you choose one.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.313
Can I have one of these...
I'll have two.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.116
OK, listen, look at this.
What is this?

20:06.200 --> 20:08.156
You wanna get over here?

20:08.240 --> 20:11.915
Look at this guy, he's somethin'
else, isn't he? Look at this.

20:14.120 --> 20:15.314
[Phone rings]

20:20.800 --> 20:21.755
Yeah?

20:22.040 --> 20:23.189
Yeah, put him on.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.037
Come on, Jack. Did I just
step off the banana boat?

20:27.360 --> 20:29.794
I don't give a rat's ass.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.996
It's not even in the ball park.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.993
Get outta here.

20:34.280 --> 20:37.192
When you guys land back
on Earth, give me a call.

20:37.280 --> 20:38.713
Oh, yeah, and thank you.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.029
Libby? Jeff!

20:45.240 --> 20:46.195
Libby!

20:46.280 --> 20:47.429
Jeff! Excuse me.

20:50.640 --> 20:52.551
I thought I lost you guys.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.949
It's starting again.

20:54.040 --> 20:55.519
Well, where's the Benadryl?

20:55.600 --> 20:56.555
Mom's got it.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.709
It's the cats.

20:57.800 --> 21:00.712
I thought you weren't
supposed to play with cats?

21:01.520 --> 21:03.556
I was just petting them.

21:03.640 --> 21:06.552
I tried to warn him,
but no-one listens to me.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.868
I know that, honey.

21:07.960 --> 21:12.033
Well, I guess we shouldn't tell
your mom too much about this.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.109
Why?

21:13.200 --> 21:15.509
Well, we don't wanna upset her.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.352
I don't like to lie.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.274
You don't have to lie,
but Jeff's still sneezing...

21:21.360 --> 21:22.679
- So?
- [Jeff sneezes]

21:30.920 --> 21:32.035
Out you come.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.997
I'm real sorry I was late.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.877
- Love you.
- Love you too.

21:35.960 --> 21:38.793
Mom, Dad took Jeff to the pets.

21:38.880 --> 21:39.949
[Magruder]
Take your Benadryl.

21:40.160 --> 21:41.195
[Sneezes]

21:43.160 --> 21:44.752
For God's sake, Rick.

21:44.840 --> 21:45.795
What?

21:45.880 --> 21:48.553
I've warned you about pet shops.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.551
Leeanne, they were just there.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.517
He's allergic to cats.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.795
What?
Should I keep him on a leash?

21:54.880 --> 21:57.348
Keep yourself on a leash.
Look at you.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.034
- What?
- I can smell her on you.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.588
Well, I can smell something
on you, Leeanne.

22:05.960 --> 22:07.279
Good morning, Cassandra.

22:07.360 --> 22:08.315
Good afternoon.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.753
I know. Hi, Konnie.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.956
Mr Whittaker called.
Mr Howard rang again

22:12.040 --> 22:14.110
for a response
on the Jensens case.

22:14.200 --> 22:16.156
And Judge Russo asked
about golf.

22:16.240 --> 22:19.994
Tell Howard I haven't heard yet
and make Russo sweat a little.

22:20.080 --> 22:23.390
- And can I have some...
- What? What?

22:23.480 --> 22:25.994
Coffee. Same shirt?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.035
I didn't notice.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.759
[TV] Jim, we haven't seen
all we're gonna have.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.479
A stationary front sits
right on top of us.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.195
All right, Konnie.

22:36.280 --> 22:38.350
Thought you might be
a little hungry.

22:38.440 --> 22:41.113
A lot of food left over
from last night.

22:41.200 --> 22:44.112
And Philip wants to talk
when you get a chance.

22:46.360 --> 22:47.588
What we got here?

22:48.720 --> 22:49.789
[Groans]

23:16.360 --> 23:17.918
[Phone beeps]

23:21.400 --> 23:23.277
[Ringing tone]

23:26.320 --> 23:27.469
[Man]
Caviar House?

23:28.520 --> 23:33.640
Yeah, you catered last night
for Dunson, Hess and Magruder,

23:33.720 --> 23:37.395
and, um, one of the caterers
left a jacket,

23:37.480 --> 23:40.358
and I wanted
to get it back to her.

23:40.440 --> 23:42.510
[Man]
Sure. Do you have a name?

23:44.800 --> 23:46.756
No, I don't have a name.

23:47.880 --> 23:53.955
Uh, she was a girl, about 5'7",
brunette and, um...

23:54.040 --> 23:55.519
[Man]
We have a lot of people.

23:55.600 --> 23:57.989
You need Jerry.
He's back tomorrow.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.755
[Coughs] Yeah, well,
I agree with you on this one

24:01.840 --> 24:05.913
and I agree also that this case
should never get to trial.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.195
I think we can achieve that.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.510
I appreciate your call.
Thank you.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.997
You didn't even get her name.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.035
What?

24:14.120 --> 24:15.235
I'm simply curious.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.993
You just keep propositioning
people until somebody says yes?

24:18.080 --> 24:19.115
Come on, Lois.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.589
Or was this another
of your regular girls

24:21.680 --> 24:23.750
who have trouble with
too many syllables?

24:23.840 --> 24:25.990
How many syllables do you need?

24:26.080 --> 24:27.274
Sign this for me.

24:27.360 --> 24:29.237
By the end of the day.

24:29.320 --> 24:30.753
Yes, ma'am.

24:32.720 --> 24:33.789
Thank you, Lois.

24:33.880 --> 24:34.835
You're welcome.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.676
Konnie,
I'll be back in one hour.

24:46.760 --> 24:47.556
[Konnie]
What about...

24:47.640 --> 24:50.996
I'll call 'em later.
Lois. So sorry for the delay.

24:51.080 --> 24:52.513
Have a nice day!

25:21.400 --> 25:23.197
[Knocks]
Hello!

25:27.520 --> 25:29.078
Anybody home?

25:36.800 --> 25:38.119
Hello?

25:48.080 --> 25:49.798
Anybody home?

25:54.400 --> 25:55.799
Hello? Anybody home?

25:55.880 --> 25:56.949
Jesus!

26:05.880 --> 26:08.110
[Ringing tone]

26:08.560 --> 26:11.552
Konnie, get Clyde
to meet me at the office.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.313
I'll explain when he gets there.
OK, see you later.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.195
Hey, Cassandra.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.275
Where's Konnie?

26:19.360 --> 26:20.793
[Cassandra]
She's in with Lois.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.440
- Has Clyde Pell shown up?
- No, sir.

26:23.520 --> 26:26.318
Cassandra, put your legs
away and answer the phone.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.275
While you're here.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.597
Hey, Konnie?
Where's Clyde Pell?

26:30.680 --> 26:33.069
I told you to get him right now.

26:33.160 --> 26:34.149
- I did.
- So where is he?

26:35.680 --> 26:37.398
She's been waiting for you.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.632
I had to see you.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.234
I went to the house.
I saw what he did.

26:49.920 --> 26:52.480
- Everything'll be all right.
- [Konnie] Can I get anything?

26:52.560 --> 26:55.233
Get Lois. Clyde shows up,
bring him right in.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.479
Son of a bitch.

26:57.560 --> 26:58.629
[Whispers]
Hey.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.233
I liked that cat.

27:00.840 --> 27:04.150
I came home from work
this afternoon and found him.

27:04.240 --> 27:05.832
[Whispers]
I know, I know.

27:06.280 --> 27:07.235
I'm scared.

27:11.480 --> 27:13.038
No smokin' in here, right?

27:13.120 --> 27:15.156
Mr Pell, Mr Magruder's waiting.

27:15.240 --> 27:17.629
How're you, sweet cheeks?
You're lookin' fine.

27:17.720 --> 27:20.871
Thank you. Don't play
with my phone. Go on in.

27:20.960 --> 27:22.791
I won't,
if you don't play with my...

27:22.880 --> 27:24.438
Hey, remember me?
Private dick?

27:24.520 --> 27:26.476
Don't touch me.
Mr Magruder's waiting.

27:26.560 --> 27:28.551
I called half an hour ago.

27:28.640 --> 27:31.074
I know, my pager's on the fritz.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.991
- Hey, Rick.
- Hey, Clyde.

27:34.080 --> 27:36.514
Thanks for comin'
at short notice.

27:36.600 --> 27:38.989
[Coughs]
Clyde Pell, this is, er...

27:39.080 --> 27:40.479
Doss. Mallory Doss.

27:40.560 --> 27:41.788
You know each other?

27:41.880 --> 27:43.074
- No.
- Not exactly.

27:43.160 --> 27:44.559
What does that mean?

27:44.640 --> 27:46.392
Well, maybe she don't
remember me.

27:46.480 --> 27:49.836
I investigated her father.
Shoeless Joe, they call him.

27:49.920 --> 27:52.434
- For what?
- I worked at the DA. Tax case.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.959
Some fringe group applied
for religious exemption.

27:57.040 --> 27:59.429
Joe was up shit creek
without a paddle.

27:59.520 --> 28:00.555
[Coughs]
Excuse me, ma'am.

28:00.800 --> 28:01.949
Come on in, Lois.

28:02.040 --> 28:05.157
You know Clyde.
Mallory Doss, Lois Harlan,

28:05.240 --> 28:06.593
one of my associates.

28:06.680 --> 28:07.954
- Hello.
- Hi.

28:08.040 --> 28:10.554
Didn't you waitress
at the party last night?

28:10.640 --> 28:11.595
That's right.

28:11.680 --> 28:14.240
Sit on down, Lois.
You should hear this.

28:14.320 --> 28:17.835
Mallory, why don't you tell them
just what's been happening?

28:19.120 --> 28:22.271
Well, my daddy's always
been a bit different.

28:22.360 --> 28:26.672
He dresses real strange
and he don't wear any shoes,

28:26.760 --> 28:28.910
and doesn't get along
with many people.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.433
But lately things have got...

28:30.520 --> 28:32.829
He's threatenin' her, stalkin'
her, breakin' into her house...

28:33.560 --> 28:37.838
He stole my car a couple
of times, and then my cat...

28:37.920 --> 28:39.478
[Magruder]
He strung up her cat.

28:39.560 --> 28:40.754
Wow. No offence, ma'am,

28:40.840 --> 28:44.753
but he's always appeared
a few beers shy of a six-pack.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.949
Well, we should maybe
ask some questions,

28:48.040 --> 28:49.234
just to help out.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.231
You have any other family?

28:52.680 --> 28:54.796
No. Momma died eight years ago.

28:54.880 --> 28:56.108
Any brothers or sisters?

28:56.200 --> 28:57.155
No.

28:57.360 --> 28:58.998
Any of your father's family
livin'?

28:59.080 --> 29:00.229
Not that I know of.

29:00.320 --> 29:03.630
Does your father have an
attorney to handle his affairs?

29:03.720 --> 29:05.438
No, Daddy hates attorneys.

29:05.520 --> 29:09.433
He had one, but he went nuts
and jumped out a window.

29:09.520 --> 29:11.272
There's one with a conscience.

29:13.560 --> 29:16.518
Well, we're gonna need someone.

29:16.600 --> 29:19.273
We need someone to corroborate
your father's behaviour,

29:19.360 --> 29:21.476
confirm he's been
doing this stuff.

29:21.560 --> 29:22.709
I don't know.

29:23.320 --> 29:25.038
Pete, maybe.

29:25.120 --> 29:26.075
Pete?

29:26.160 --> 29:30.950
Peter Randle, my ex-husband.
Daddy put him in hospital once.

29:31.040 --> 29:32.109
Why's that?

29:33.240 --> 29:35.959
Because he drank out
of Daddy's favourite cup.

29:37.560 --> 29:40.518
We'll need him to testify
as to your father's behaviour

29:40.600 --> 29:42.192
when we get into court.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.795
Well, I don't know.
We're not friends exactly.

29:45.880 --> 29:49.509
He swore he wouldn't piss on me
if I was on fire.

29:50.440 --> 29:51.714
We'll talk to him.

29:52.520 --> 29:56.718
I think you should leave your
house while this is going on.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.392
I don't have my things.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.677
Clyde'll drive you to get them,
then to the Bayshore.

30:01.760 --> 30:04.115
- It's a nice quiet place.
- Who'll pay?

30:04.200 --> 30:06.794
We will. We'll talk
about it later, Lois.

30:06.880 --> 30:10.190
So you get Clyde some addresses,
your father and ex-husband.

30:10.280 --> 30:11.918
Maybe some telephone numbers.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.436
And then I'll fill in Lois,
and she'll be in touch.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.431
No, I thought
you'd handle this?

30:17.520 --> 30:19.511
Lois is just gonna help out.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.113
It'll be OK, I promise.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.272
Clyde, you want to...?

30:29.880 --> 30:32.519
Yep. Yeah, you come on with me.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.158
[Magruder]
Get her into Bayshore, OK?

30:34.240 --> 30:35.195
C'mon.

30:36.880 --> 30:38.029
[Door closes]

30:40.000 --> 30:40.955
[Sighs]

30:41.040 --> 30:44.077
I thought our firm didn't handle
these kinds of cases.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.832
Cases where people need help?

30:45.920 --> 30:48.912
Ask me, it looks like
she can help herself.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.149
A few others too.

30:50.240 --> 30:51.468
What's that mean, Lois?

30:51.560 --> 30:53.994
Nothing.
It's just you don't know her.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.035
There may be...

30:55.120 --> 30:56.678
There's no other reason,
no money.

30:56.760 --> 31:00.150
She wants her father to get
better. It'll take a week.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.959
Before you put him away,
make sure he's nuts...

31:03.040 --> 31:05.315
You don't wanna do this,
we can talk when it's done.

31:05.400 --> 31:08.790
I'll handle it, as long
as you know what you're doing.

31:08.880 --> 31:10.757
[Ringing tone]

31:11.000 --> 31:12.433
[Woman on phone]
Hello?

31:12.520 --> 31:14.636
Hey, Diane.
Rick Magruder for Judge Russo.

31:14.720 --> 31:15.835
[Diane]
Hi, how are you?

31:15.920 --> 31:17.194
I'm good, thank you.

31:17.280 --> 31:19.919
Hold on while I get him for you.

31:21.600 --> 31:23.636
- Roy Russo.
- What's the word?

31:23.720 --> 31:26.154
Rick, you gotta give me
another shot.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.232
I'll give you another shot,
you'll get your swing back.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.675
So what can I do for you?

31:31.760 --> 31:36.117
You mind givin' a subpoena
commitment order a quick glance?

31:36.200 --> 31:37.553
What's the story?

31:37.640 --> 31:41.838
Nothing earth-shattering,
just some... nutty old man.

31:55.640 --> 31:56.595
[Cop]
Hey!

31:57.120 --> 31:59.076
[Cop]
Hey! Hey!

32:02.040 --> 32:03.837
[Cop]
Talk to you for a second?

32:05.640 --> 32:07.756
[Cop]
Sir! Sir!

32:08.040 --> 32:10.600
[Cop] Looking for Dixon Doss.
Looking for Dixon Doss!

32:10.680 --> 32:11.635
[Knocking]

32:11.720 --> 32:14.678
[Cop] We're looking
for Dixon Doss. He around?

32:14.760 --> 32:16.955
- [Man] No.
- We got a warrant.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.598
[Shouting]

32:19.520 --> 32:21.112
[Cop]
Looking for Dixon Doss!

32:21.200 --> 32:22.269
[Cop]
Whoa, slow down!

32:22.360 --> 32:24.032
[Cop]
Hey! You Dixon Doss?

32:24.120 --> 32:25.189
[Smashing]

32:25.280 --> 32:27.077
[Cop]
We're looking for Dixon Doss.

32:27.160 --> 32:28.752
Hey, you can't go anywhere.

32:28.840 --> 32:32.276
They gotta talk to you.
Hey, Officer! We got one here!

32:32.360 --> 32:33.952
[Cop]
Anybody else back there?

32:40.600 --> 32:42.556
- [Cop] Anybody here?
- [Man] I'm not Dixon.

32:42.640 --> 32:43.959
[Cop]
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

32:46.400 --> 32:47.594
[Cop]
Get back there!

32:47.680 --> 32:48.829
[Shouting]

32:52.640 --> 32:55.438
[Cop]
Hey! Hey, sir? Get that guy!

32:55.520 --> 32:56.635
[Cop]
Dixon Doss?

32:56.720 --> 32:58.551
[Cop]
Hey, hey! What's your name?

32:59.680 --> 33:00.874
[Shouting]

33:02.840 --> 33:05.559
[Cop] Everybody out front!
We're takin' IDs.

33:05.640 --> 33:07.039
[Cop]
Move it out.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.110
[Cop]
Pick it up! Come on!

33:14.240 --> 33:16.196
[Cop]
Let's go, guys, everybody out!

33:19.440 --> 33:21.431
[Cop]
Come on. Pick it up.

33:25.560 --> 33:27.118
[Cop]
You got some ID?

33:27.720 --> 33:30.553
[Cop] Looking for Dixon Doss!
Dixon Doss!

33:32.360 --> 33:33.793
[Cop]
Aw, c'mon, fellas!

33:35.240 --> 33:37.151
[Confused shouting]

33:49.960 --> 33:51.632
Where are your shoes, buddy?

33:52.080 --> 33:53.433
Officer!

33:56.040 --> 33:57.393
That's him!

34:10.360 --> 34:13.556
[Clyde] His old lady kicked it,
coupla years back.

34:13.639 --> 34:16.632
Left him a few thousand
acres of unimproved land.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.072
There's nothing there, right?

34:18.159 --> 34:20.036
Enough for your
dry cleaning bill.

34:20.120 --> 34:22.076
- You seen my bill?
- Yes, Giorgio.

34:22.280 --> 34:24.998
- Remember you saw the house?
- I saw it.

34:25.080 --> 34:29.119
Land's got some cabins on it,
but no water, no roads.

34:29.199 --> 34:31.793
Nothing adds up.
It ain't even near anything.

34:33.520 --> 34:35.033
Tax rolls say it's...

34:35.679 --> 34:38.638
There... Around $13 an acre.

34:40.239 --> 34:41.309
Speakin' of dollars...

34:41.400 --> 34:43.391
What? What? What? What?

34:43.480 --> 34:45.630
How's she making her retainer?

34:46.800 --> 34:48.755
[Bell tolls]

34:56.920 --> 34:58.797
[Seagulls call]

35:20.200 --> 35:23.272
- Where's the captain, buddy?
- Right up there.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.638
- Hey, tough guy.
- [Cat miaows]

35:37.720 --> 35:39.119
That one's called Ike.

35:39.200 --> 35:43.034
- He looks like the general.
- No, like Ike and Tina.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.793
Still, looks like
he's been through a war.

35:45.880 --> 35:48.792
- Needs nine lives on this rig.
- Yeah.

35:48.880 --> 35:51.917
If the machinery don't get 'em,
the gearbox usually does.

35:52.000 --> 35:55.470
Grind a 200lb man into
cheeseburger, let alone a cat.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.199
I'm looking for the captain,
Peter Randle?

35:58.280 --> 35:59.793
Yeah, that'd be me.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.711
Oh, shit on my hands.

36:01.800 --> 36:04.109
Capitano. Busboy. Receptionist.
You from Port Authority?

36:04.200 --> 36:07.670
No, I'm Rick Magruder.
Attorney for your ex-wife.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.069
Oh.

36:09.680 --> 36:12.148
Bitch has had her
last dime from me.

36:12.240 --> 36:13.992
It's not about that, Mr Randle.

36:14.080 --> 36:16.878
I'm here in the matter
of her father.

36:17.520 --> 36:20.956
What? Something happen
to that old shoeless fruitcake?

36:21.040 --> 36:22.268
I hope he croaked.

36:22.360 --> 36:26.194
Miss Doss wants him committed.
He's become unstable.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.235
Become?

36:27.320 --> 36:29.993
He never had a stable day
in his life.

36:30.080 --> 36:32.469
He's become dangerous
to himself and his daughter.

36:32.560 --> 36:34.915
I understand
he attacked you once?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.718
Ain't no big deal.

36:36.800 --> 36:39.712
That's not what I heard,
Mr Randle.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.270
[Loud machinery]
He put you in hospital.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.349
He what?

36:43.440 --> 36:46.398
We know that he put
you in a hospital.

36:47.800 --> 36:51.918
I'd like you to testify, to help
establish violent tendencies.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.831
You want me to help Mallory?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.512
That's the general idea, sir.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.716
That'll be a cold day in hell.

36:57.800 --> 37:00.951
I wouldn't piss on her,
if she was on fire.

37:01.040 --> 37:03.918
We're aware of your
urinary problem, sir.

37:05.080 --> 37:06.195
Thing is...

37:07.320 --> 37:10.312
Mr Randle,
I can force you to testify.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.470
You couldn't force me
to do anything,

37:12.560 --> 37:15.438
except throw your sorry ass
off this vessel.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.239
We can talk about that
when you're subpoenaed.

37:18.320 --> 37:20.788
I'll look forward to seeing you
in court, Mr Randle.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.759
[Bailiff]
All rise!

37:29.040 --> 37:30.189
All rise!

37:34.440 --> 37:35.759
Be seated, please.

37:37.360 --> 37:39.794
My calendar shows this
is a competency hearing.

37:39.880 --> 37:41.472
Are we ready to proceed?

37:41.560 --> 37:42.754
Yes, Your Honour.

37:42.840 --> 37:43.795
[Judge]
Mr Cherry?

37:43.880 --> 37:46.872
Your Honour, I regret
to inform you this late,

37:46.960 --> 37:48.996
but I've been discharged
by Mr Doss.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.877
He wishes
no legal representation.

37:51.360 --> 37:52.634
Is this so?

37:54.560 --> 37:58.678
You understand you're waiving
your right to an attorney?

37:58.760 --> 37:59.715
[Whispers]
Yes, sir.

38:01.400 --> 38:04.915
Since this isn't a criminal
matter, I'll let it proceed.

38:05.000 --> 38:06.956
But please stand by, Mr Cherry.

38:07.040 --> 38:07.995
Yes, sir.

38:08.080 --> 38:10.275
- Mr Magruder?
- Yes, Your Honour.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.158
We will prove the respondent
is mentally incompetent,

38:13.240 --> 38:16.232
and call our first witness,
Dr Bernice Sampson.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.512
[Dr Sampson]
Disoriented, certainly.

38:20.600 --> 38:24.070
And showing distinct signs
of paranoia as well.

38:24.160 --> 38:29.393
He was utterly uncooperative
and given to violent outbursts.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.118
And your conclusions, Doctor?

38:31.200 --> 38:34.590
Judging from his behaviour
I'd say Mr Doss suffers

38:34.680 --> 38:37.399
from rather acute schizophrenia.

38:37.480 --> 38:42.156
I recommend that he be committed
to hospital for an evaluation.

38:42.240 --> 38:44.708
Unmedicated and untreated,

38:44.800 --> 38:48.236
he is volatile
and possibly dangerous,

38:48.320 --> 38:51.073
- to himself and others.
- [Magruder] Thank you, Doctor.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.798
Any questions, Mr Doss?

38:55.600 --> 38:56.635
Mr Cherry?

38:58.960 --> 39:00.916
You may step down, Doctor.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.119
Next witness, Mr Magruder.

39:04.200 --> 39:06.475
Your Honour,
we call Mr Peter Randle,

39:06.560 --> 39:08.994
who appears today
pursuant to a subpoena.

39:09.080 --> 39:10.069
[Judge]
Noted.

39:11.520 --> 39:12.873
[Bailiff]
Come forward, sir.

39:16.960 --> 39:18.678
[Bailiff]
Raise your right hand.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.718
Do you swear the evidence you
give the court is the truth,

39:21.800 --> 39:24.473
the whole truth and nothing but
the truth, so help you God?

39:24.560 --> 39:26.516
- Yeah, OK.
- Have a seat.

39:30.160 --> 39:33.311
Mr Randle, what is
your relation to Mr Doss?

39:33.400 --> 39:36.949
Oh, yeah, I used to be
married to his daughter.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.996
Is she here?
Please point her out.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.752
That skinny girl over there.

39:40.840 --> 39:45.038
Let the record show he indicated
Mr Doss's daughter, Mallory.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.759
Your marriage ended in divorce,
I believe, sir.

39:47.840 --> 39:48.875
Yeah.

39:48.960 --> 39:51.793
During your marriage you made
acquaintance with Mr Doss,

39:51.880 --> 39:55.077
and your relationship with him
was turbulent, was it not?

39:56.040 --> 39:58.270
Well, c'mon,
you had fights with him.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.715
You had actual physical
confrontations, didn't you?

40:00.800 --> 40:01.755
Why?

40:01.840 --> 40:03.558
Non-responsive, Your Honour.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.959
Answer the question.

40:05.040 --> 40:06.439
I don't remember.

40:07.240 --> 40:11.597
Did you go to hospital after any
of these incidents, Mr Randle?

40:12.520 --> 40:14.909
May I remind you you're on oath?

40:15.000 --> 40:16.319
[Judge]
No, I will.

40:16.400 --> 40:20.279
Mr Randle, answer the question,
or I'll hold you in contempt.

40:20.360 --> 40:24.353
Punishable by a fine and up to
30 days in jail. Understood?

40:24.440 --> 40:28.638
Yes, sir, but you can't prove
I remember something I don't.

40:28.720 --> 40:31.075
Let's see if you remember this,
Mr Randle.

40:31.160 --> 40:35.597
Is it true, as it says here,
three years ago you were

40:35.680 --> 40:39.434
admitted to Savannah Memorial
Hospital with concussion?

40:40.160 --> 40:41.354
Yeah, I guess.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.317
Well, I guess so too, sir.

40:43.400 --> 40:46.039
It says here,
on your medical record,

40:46.120 --> 40:48.953
that you were clubbed
with a stick of firewood.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.838
A stick of firewood, Mr Randle.
You remember that?

40:51.920 --> 40:52.875
[Chuckling]
Yeah.

40:52.960 --> 40:54.678
By whose hand, sir?

40:56.200 --> 40:57.155
Doss.

40:57.240 --> 40:58.912
Mr Doss. Counsel.

41:03.800 --> 41:05.358
[Shouting]

41:06.440 --> 41:09.671
That kind of behaviour will not
be allowed. Get them out!

41:15.320 --> 41:16.878
[Whispers]
We just won the case.

41:18.120 --> 41:20.190
[Judge]
Mr Magruder, please continue.

41:20.800 --> 41:24.952
Mr Randle, why did Mr Doss
attack you with a stick?

41:25.040 --> 41:27.508
'Cos I drank out of his cup.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.910
[Magruder]
'Cos you drank out of his cup.

41:31.000 --> 41:34.037
On March 17th the following year
you received 22 stitches

41:34.120 --> 41:36.953
in your right arm.
Mr Doss again, I believe?

41:37.040 --> 41:39.031
- Yeah.
- That's all, Your Honour.

41:39.120 --> 41:41.350
If you have any defence,
Mr Doss...

41:41.440 --> 41:44.637
Your Honour, nothin'
this asshole said is true,

41:44.720 --> 41:47.837
but help me with this,
will you, Your Honour?

41:47.920 --> 41:52.471
You arrest me, you arrest me
based on her pack of lies.

41:52.560 --> 41:56.314
You appoint me a lawyer who's
incompetent, inexperienced,

41:56.400 --> 41:58.914
he probably cheated his way
through law school.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.276
On top of that, two doctors
examine me, they come in,

42:02.360 --> 42:05.113
look at my eyes
and then rush out.

42:05.200 --> 42:09.034
The first one wanted me to name
the first five presidents.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.918
Can you do that, Judge?
Let me hear you.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.673
Name the first five presidents
of the United States.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.751
George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln, John Kennedy...

42:16.840 --> 42:17.795
Mr Doss?

42:17.880 --> 42:20.678
Mr Doss! I don't answer
questions, I ask them.

42:20.760 --> 42:23.228
They ought to ship
you off for 90 days.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.717
This man's terrorised
his own daughter.

42:25.800 --> 42:27.756
He needs treating.
Simple as that.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.159
[Judge]
That's enough.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.119
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:32.200 --> 42:34.794
Mr Doss, please stand.
Stand up.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.949
[Whispers]
Yes, sir.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.111
After hearing the evidence here,

42:40.200 --> 42:44.113
I think it's best
for you and all concerned

42:44.200 --> 42:45.189
that you be hospitalised,

42:45.280 --> 42:48.989
in Georgia Regional in Savannah
for psychiatric examination.

42:49.080 --> 42:51.799
I order that you be
admitted for that purpose.

42:54.480 --> 42:56.232
[Guard]
Come on, Mr Doss.

43:08.200 --> 43:09.792
You little bitch!

43:16.040 --> 43:16.995
Judge?

43:17.840 --> 43:18.955
Can I go?

43:34.320 --> 43:36.993
[Magruder] It's paying bills,
checking investments,

43:37.080 --> 43:39.878
making sure he doesn't suffer
financially in hospital.

43:39.960 --> 43:42.713
That's why they call it
conservator.

43:42.800 --> 43:44.870
But can't you
be the conservator?

43:44.960 --> 43:48.111
If I touch his money,
he'll accuse me of stealing it.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.919
You have to,
you're the next of kin.

43:51.000 --> 43:55.391
Besides, you need court approval
for every penny spent.

43:55.480 --> 43:56.674
Oh, good.

43:56.760 --> 43:59.638
Anyway, they'll get your father
on Lithium, treat him.

43:59.720 --> 44:02.678
In a few months
he'll feel a lot better.

45:33.080 --> 45:34.035
[Mallory screams]

45:35.560 --> 45:37.039
[Cries out]

45:38.960 --> 45:41.315
No! No, no, no!

45:41.400 --> 45:44.358
[Magruder]
Hey, easy, easy. Hey.

45:45.280 --> 45:47.077
[Moans]

46:03.480 --> 46:06.313
[Mallory]
It was a dream. I was dreaming.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.992
[Magruder]
Was it him?

46:08.280 --> 46:11.716
[Mallory]
It was him. It's always him.

46:13.080 --> 46:14.433
When I was a kid

46:14.520 --> 46:16.511
he used to tell me stories,

46:16.600 --> 46:19.512
and they became
stranger and scarier.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.672
He'd come into my room
and sit on my bed and he'd...

46:26.320 --> 46:27.799
There was one...

46:29.400 --> 46:31.550
The one about
the Gingerbread Man.

46:32.560 --> 46:36.075
A lonely old man and woman
who lived in the woods.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.149
They had no children,

46:37.240 --> 46:40.437
so she decides
to bake a gingerbread man.

46:41.280 --> 46:44.670
And when he comes out
the oven he's alive.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.799
And he runs out of the house,
and past the cow,

46:48.880 --> 46:52.714
past the horse, past men
who all want to eat him up.

46:52.800 --> 46:54.677
But he keeps
runnin' and yellin',

46:54.760 --> 46:57.877
[Both] "Run, run as fast as you
can, you can't catch me,

46:57.960 --> 46:59.757
"I'm the Gingerbread Man."

46:59.840 --> 47:00.511
That's it.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.431
And he grew very proud,

47:02.520 --> 47:06.149
because he thought
no-one would ever catch him.

47:06.240 --> 47:09.994
Until one day,
he came upon a river,

47:10.080 --> 47:13.755
which he couldn't cross, or he'd
break into little pieces.

47:13.840 --> 47:17.515
So he lets this fox,
who promises not to eat him,

47:17.600 --> 47:19.511
carry him across on his back.

47:19.600 --> 47:22.592
Only, just before
they reach the other side,

47:22.680 --> 47:25.319
the fox snaps his head back,

47:25.400 --> 47:27.356
and swallows him whole.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.238
My daddy used to warn me,

47:33.320 --> 47:38.189
it was just as easy
for little children to disappear

47:38.280 --> 47:40.840
as it was for gingerbread men.

47:57.880 --> 47:59.677
[Children chatter]

48:03.160 --> 48:06.357
Now, is somebody gonna help me
with this food here?

48:07.120 --> 48:09.554
Is anyone gonna
help me carry this?

48:09.640 --> 48:11.278
I'm gonna catch you!

48:11.840 --> 48:13.956
[Libby]
C'mon! Don't stop! Don't stop!

48:14.080 --> 48:16.275
You gonna give me a hand here?

48:16.360 --> 48:18.954
OK, last one there
gets no food!

48:19.040 --> 48:20.439
[Children scream]

48:27.760 --> 48:31.639
Who wants to eat? Am I gonna
be carryin' this stuff all day?

48:32.480 --> 48:35.392
You want some food?
OK, what did we order?

48:35.480 --> 48:37.710
- [Jeff] Mashed potatoes.
- [Libby] I get the chicken.

48:37.800 --> 48:39.995
[Magruder] You order chicken,
you get chicken.

48:40.080 --> 48:41.877
Macaroni cheese,
you get macaroni cheese.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.474
Listen, I just saw
someone from work.

48:44.560 --> 48:47.757
You lay this stuff out.
I'll be right back.

48:53.280 --> 48:54.315
Well...

48:54.400 --> 48:56.675
Fancy meetin' you here.

48:56.760 --> 48:57.749
It's a sign.

48:57.840 --> 48:59.956
- Hey.
- How are you?

49:00.040 --> 49:02.076
OK. Cute kids.

49:02.160 --> 49:03.878
You wanna come meet 'em?

49:04.880 --> 49:06.996
You sure it's a good idea?

49:07.080 --> 49:08.991
I think it's a good idea.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.832
- OK.
- Come on.

49:11.320 --> 49:12.878
Libby and Jeff.

49:13.680 --> 49:15.955
Or Leffy and Jib.
Whatever you want.

49:18.440 --> 49:20.112
[Magruder]
Or Leffy and Jib.

49:20.200 --> 49:23.158
You'll endear yourself
by calling them different names.

49:23.240 --> 49:24.559
[Mallory]
What's for lunch?

49:24.640 --> 49:26.517
We got everything you can get.

49:28.000 --> 49:30.992
Hey, guys! Here's somebody
I know. Say hello to her.

49:31.080 --> 49:33.640
Libby, say hello to Mallory.

49:33.720 --> 49:36.314
Jeff, say hello to Mallory.
Shake hands.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.756
I'm Jeff, I'm a lovely person
with a fabulous dad.

49:39.840 --> 49:42.673
- Come and sit down.
- In your dreams!

49:42.760 --> 49:45.354
My dreams? In your dreams!
Come and eat.

49:46.920 --> 49:48.069
[Clyde]
Hi, there.

49:51.240 --> 49:53.231
[Magruder] OK, so...
[Clyde] Hi, Rick!

49:53.880 --> 49:55.074
[Clyde]
Rick!

49:56.440 --> 49:58.032
You tell him we're comin' here?

49:58.120 --> 50:00.714
No. Did you tell him
we were going?

50:02.040 --> 50:04.793
Guys, lay this stuff out
and help yourselves.

50:04.880 --> 50:06.233
I'll be right back.

50:09.640 --> 50:10.789
[Camera clicks]

50:13.920 --> 50:15.069
[Camera clicks]

50:17.240 --> 50:19.071
How'd you know to come here?

50:19.160 --> 50:21.879
That's my profession. I gotta
tell you something quick.

50:21.960 --> 50:22.915
What's the matter?

50:23.000 --> 50:25.116
I don't want to panic Miss Doss,

50:25.200 --> 50:27.998
but her old man didn't like
his new address.

50:28.080 --> 50:29.035
What?

50:29.120 --> 50:32.635
Some wingnuts from the group
broke into the hospital,

50:32.720 --> 50:34.472
busted him out somehow.

50:34.560 --> 50:36.994
Staff put someone in his room
by mistake.

50:37.080 --> 50:38.513
Didn't even know till today.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.398
- Son of a bitch.
- Don't freak, but...

50:41.480 --> 50:44.790
- I'd keep an eye on her.
- Sure. Thanks.

50:44.880 --> 50:47.599
Listen, do me a favour?
Take the kids home?

50:47.680 --> 50:50.433
Leeanne's back soon.
Don't tell her what's goin' on.

50:50.520 --> 50:52.033
Say I got tied up.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.918
Hey, guys!
Clyde's gonna give you a ride!

50:55.000 --> 50:57.389
[TV]
...It's not much comfort.

50:57.480 --> 51:00.233
Introducing
the Norelco reflex...

51:00.320 --> 51:03.869
[Weatherman]... Has become
Hurricane Geraldo, and is...

51:03.960 --> 51:06.679
[Woman]... Scared and anxious
for no real reason?

51:06.760 --> 51:09.399
[Magruder] Sorry, Leeanne,
this is real important.

51:09.480 --> 51:12.199
I promise, if it wasn't an
emergency, I wouldn't do it.

51:12.280 --> 51:15.716
Come on, you know Clyde, the
kids are comfortable with him.

51:15.800 --> 51:17.313
I just don't like him.

51:17.960 --> 51:18.949
Never have.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.993
The guy hung around
here for an hour.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.036
Then he asked for a drink.

51:24.120 --> 51:26.395
[Leeanne]
He was flirtin' with me too.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.198
- Well...
- I don't trust him.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.874
He did me a favour
droppin' off the kids,

51:30.960 --> 51:33.793
and he's gone now, so let it go.

51:33.880 --> 51:36.952
I don't want that drunk
hangin' round my children.

51:37.040 --> 51:40.271
- [Doorbell]
- Mind if I call you later?

51:40.360 --> 51:42.828
[Leeanne]
As a matter of fact, I do.

51:42.920 --> 51:44.478
Well...

51:45.160 --> 51:47.754
I'll give you a call later.
I'm sorry.

51:47.840 --> 51:48.795
[Phone beeps]

51:49.600 --> 51:51.352
- Rick, wait.
- [Doorbell rings again]

51:52.920 --> 51:57.516
I was scared. Clyde said
if I had one I should carry it.

51:57.960 --> 51:59.234
Take it.

52:03.200 --> 52:04.189
[Knock at door]

52:44.640 --> 52:45.675
What is it?

52:45.760 --> 52:47.557
They left it on the steps.

52:49.040 --> 52:50.075
[Explosion]

52:52.840 --> 52:53.636
[Car alarm sounds]

52:56.520 --> 52:57.714
Get your things.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.835
Where we goin'?

52:58.920 --> 53:01.150
Just get your bag.
Let's get out!

53:36.240 --> 53:37.559
Where are we headed?

53:38.200 --> 53:39.679
To get some help.

53:45.960 --> 53:48.679
But we weren't
even in there very long.

53:48.760 --> 53:52.309
Then we got the picture
and then the car blew up.

53:52.880 --> 53:55.678
Did the doorbell ring
or just a knock?

53:55.760 --> 53:57.034
Why?

53:57.120 --> 53:58.997
Helps with the profile.

53:59.080 --> 54:01.674
Certain criminals knock,
others ring doorbells.

54:01.760 --> 54:04.035
You understand?
This guy is dangerous.

54:04.120 --> 54:05.872
Probably why
he's a called a criminal.

54:05.960 --> 54:07.234
[Phone rings]

54:08.760 --> 54:10.990
Savannah Police Department,
Eleventh Precinct.

54:11.520 --> 54:13.397
Oh, hi, baby. How you doing?

54:13.600 --> 54:14.555
What?

54:17.840 --> 54:20.559
Can I have some help here? Hal!

54:27.240 --> 54:28.514
You can't go in there!

54:29.840 --> 54:30.955
Goddamit, Hal!

54:31.040 --> 54:33.634
- What are you doing, Magruder?
- I know what they're up to.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.393
If someone doesn't do something,
I'll make problems.

54:36.480 --> 54:39.278
We got a problem. You.
You got no manners.

54:39.360 --> 54:42.716
This place is full of guys
fed up bustin' their chops,

54:42.800 --> 54:45.598
bringin' in scumbags,
ones who shoot cops,

54:45.680 --> 54:49.275
so some champion of civil rights
like you can get 'em off.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.476
If you want to complain,
do it at the desk.

54:51.560 --> 54:53.391
Get out of my office.

54:57.160 --> 54:58.798
[Detective]
Have a nice day.

54:59.400 --> 55:02.597
[Cop] You got a car fire?
Call the fire department.

55:22.880 --> 55:24.518
[Rings doorbell]

55:24.600 --> 55:25.953
Lois!

55:26.040 --> 55:27.598
Lois! It's Rick!

55:27.680 --> 55:28.829
[Rings doorbell]

55:30.840 --> 55:32.068
Lois!

55:40.080 --> 55:43.436
I'm sorry, Lois. Her old man
flipped again real bad.

55:43.520 --> 55:45.078
Cops didn't wanna know.

55:48.880 --> 55:51.189
[Whispers]
I thought it was a good idea.

55:51.280 --> 55:52.633
[Whispers]
To bring her here?

55:52.720 --> 55:54.312
- Just tonight.
- Then?

55:54.400 --> 55:57.392
I don't know. While
he's loose she's in danger.

55:57.480 --> 55:59.038
Why are you in charge?

55:59.120 --> 56:01.076
She needs help.
Nobody else is...

56:01.160 --> 56:02.513
[Phone rings]

56:02.600 --> 56:05.353
- I paged Clyde to call here.
- Hello?

56:06.040 --> 56:07.189
[Clyde]
Hello? Lois?

56:07.640 --> 56:10.950
Hi, gorgeous.
Let me talk to Boss Man.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.916
Hold on a second, Clyde.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.194
Clyde, where are you?

56:15.280 --> 56:17.236
[Clyde] I'm at Huey's,
watchin' the storm.

56:17.320 --> 56:18.355
How long you been there?

56:18.440 --> 56:21.273
[Clyde] Two, three hours.
What's goin' on, anyway?

56:21.360 --> 56:22.793
Somebody torched Mallory's car.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.552
Jesus H. Christ.

56:25.560 --> 56:27.357
Well, anybody see anything?

56:27.440 --> 56:29.192
[Magruder]
No. It was so fast.

56:29.280 --> 56:32.670
- [Clyde] What should I do?
- When can you be here?

56:32.760 --> 56:34.830
- [Clyde] Where are you?
- At Lois's.

56:34.920 --> 56:39.357
Damn! Sorry, man, I'm a little
blown away and a little toasted.

56:39.440 --> 56:40.714
Give me the address,

56:40.800 --> 56:43.553
I'll pop over in a minute.
I'll wake up.

56:43.640 --> 56:45.710
Forget it. Go home.

56:45.800 --> 56:49.793
Get sober. Get some sleep. Meet
me at eight tomorrow morning.

56:49.880 --> 56:52.110
- [Clyde] Sure thing, boss.
- Yeah. Bye.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.559
Clyde's gonna come by tomorrow

56:55.640 --> 56:58.313
while we go to the office.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.118
Right. What about tonight?

57:00.200 --> 57:01.792
We'll stay here.

57:02.360 --> 57:04.999
We just have to decide
who sleeps with who.

57:19.320 --> 57:21.276
[Mallory moans]

57:34.000 --> 57:37.390
[TV] The last hurricane was
David, a minor hurricane.

57:37.480 --> 57:40.552
The Savannah Storm Team
will monitor all the action

57:40.640 --> 57:44.235
and keep you posted on how
to prepare for the worst.

57:44.320 --> 57:48.472
Still to come on ABC Savannah...
[Clicks off]

57:59.160 --> 58:01.754
I'll call Clyde,
figure out when they're leaving.

58:01.840 --> 58:03.159
I appreciate that.

58:03.240 --> 58:04.719
And thanks for last night.

58:06.640 --> 58:07.914
Anything good today?

58:08.000 --> 58:10.070
I'm sure last night was better.

58:10.160 --> 58:13.311
Your only exercise
is jumping to conclusions.

58:13.400 --> 58:15.960
Lois! You wanna do
this Whittaker thing today?

58:16.040 --> 58:16.995
That'd be great.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.752
You get lucky last night,
Konnie?

58:18.840 --> 58:20.717
No, I'm not very lucky, sir.

58:20.800 --> 58:23.394
I don't know,
you still got your job.

58:23.480 --> 58:24.595
Lighten up, Konnie.

58:24.680 --> 58:27.319
[Whispers]
You were being a smart ass!

58:36.400 --> 58:37.549
[Phone rings]

58:38.640 --> 58:41.393
Hey, what's seven letters
for unnerves?

58:41.480 --> 58:43.277
Should I get this?

58:43.360 --> 58:46.716
[Clyde] Blank, blank, T.
Maybe another T in there.

58:46.800 --> 58:48.392
Ah, "Rattles".

58:48.480 --> 58:50.072
[Phone rings]

58:52.160 --> 58:53.275
Yeah, hello?

58:53.360 --> 58:54.349
[On phone]
Clyde, it's Rick.

58:54.440 --> 58:56.351
What's goin' on?
Is Mallory there?

58:56.440 --> 58:58.192
[Clyde]
'Course. She's fixin' breakfast.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.510
- Wanna put her on?
- OK, hold on.

59:01.520 --> 59:02.748
Guess who?

59:04.320 --> 59:05.275
Hello?

59:05.360 --> 59:06.998
[Magruder]
Hey, how you feeling?

59:07.080 --> 59:08.718
I don't know. Little better.

59:08.800 --> 59:10.153
[Mallory]
Any news?

59:10.240 --> 59:12.879
Nothin' yet,
but they'll find him.

59:15.080 --> 59:16.638
[Magruder]
Everything goin' OK with Clyde?

59:17.120 --> 59:18.314
Sure.

59:23.320 --> 59:26.995
- Er, can I call you back?
- [Mallory] All right.

59:27.080 --> 59:27.717
[Phone beeps]

59:45.160 --> 59:46.149
What's that?

59:50.400 --> 59:51.628
Oh, my God.

59:51.720 --> 59:53.278
[Dials]

59:54.040 --> 59:55.393
[Betty]
Hello?

59:55.480 --> 59:57.471
Er, yeah, Betty,
is Leeanne there?

59:57.560 --> 01:00:00.916
[Betty] No, sir, they went to
Nashville for a couple of days.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.151
Yeah, I forgot. Uh...

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.196
Where exactly are the kids now?

01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:09.636
[Betty] In school.
Is everything all right?

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.270
Er... Yeah.
I'll call back later.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.915
[Phone beeps]

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.993
Cancel this Whittaker thing
and call Clyde,

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.475
tell him what's happening.

01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.837
Jesus, Rick!
What are you doing?

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.831
These are my kids, Lois.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.638
Maybe he's just scaring you...

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.756
Well, he's done a good job!

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.035
I'm Richard Magruder.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.793
I need to take my kids out,
right now.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:55.199
What's the problem, sir?

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.477
Let me sign what I need to.
I'm in a hurry.

01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.916
Can you let me know which
classroom they're in, please?

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.431
I gotta get moving,
could you...?

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.557
I'm sorry, sir. I need their
mother's authorisation.

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.154
I appreciate that,
but I think they're in danger.

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:14.357
- What's up here?
- I can't talk about this.

01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:17.193
Tell me where they are.
I'll get 'em.

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:20.636
I'm sorry, but our rules
in such cases...

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.836
You don't understand.
We'll talk later.

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.478
Mr Magruder!
Call Mr Pitney.

01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.833
- Libby!
- Mr Magruder...

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.875
Jeff!

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.599
Stop, or we'll call
the authorities!

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:34.557
Miss Hamrick, call the police!

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.279
- Mr Magruder.
- Put this on, honey.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.119
- Tell me where your brother is.
- You're having a bad divorce.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.872
[All talk at once]

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.837
Hey, Jeff! Jeff, there he is.

01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:48.876
- [Libby] Jeff!
- [Magruder] How are you?

01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:52.635
We're goin' on a trip.
I can't talk now.

01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:54.312
I'll call you. I'm an attorney.

01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.391
[Pitney]
All right, settle down...

01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.118
[Shouts]
Don't do that!

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.877
He's OK, he's OK.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.518
He's OK. Let's go.

01:02:05.920 --> 01:02:07.319
[Magruder]
OK, strap up!

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:10.555
Now, everything's
gonna be OK, all right?

01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.757
- You're not missing anything?
- [Libby] Yes, I am.

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.833
Miss Hamilton was
giving me a bird test.

01:02:17.920 --> 01:02:20.036
I thought you
didn't like birds? Jeff?

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:23.908
- [Jeff] I skip math!
- Well, that's good, isn't it?

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.152
You shouldn't sound so pleased,
don't tell your mom that.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.509
[Libby]
Why'd they call the police, Dad?

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:54.194
And why did Mr Pitney
try to hit you?

01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:56.157
They thought I wasn't your dad.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.549
They have to look out
for strangers.

01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.153
Is something wrong with Mom?

01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:02.231
There's nothing wrong
with Mom, honey.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.072
Then what's going on?

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:07.197
Er, we're just goin'
on a trip, darling.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.153
Will you stop talking
like I'm Jeff's age!

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.798
What's wrong with my age?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.911
[Libby]
I know something's goin' on.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.673
It's your grandmother,
she's just a little sick.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.672
- Cancer or heart attack?
- What?

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.548
She's just got a little flu,
24-hour stomach flu.

01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:26.995
She'll be fine,
once we get there.

01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.196
Then why are we going?

01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.909
Hey, why don't you two
concentrate on navigating?

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:36.515
Dad, was that judo
you used on Mr Pitney?

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.909
Yeah... that was kind of judo.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.355
[Magruder]
Come on.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:03.954
OK, you wanna get some candy?

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:07.589
Let me give you some...
watch the puddle.

01:04:09.640 --> 01:04:13.679
OK, OK, what do you want?
OK, I'll give you both one.

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:17.070
You want to fill her up, please?

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.836
[Dialling phone]

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.353
[Ringing tone]

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.909
Hey, Clyde?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.353
Rick. What's goin' on?

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.351
Nothin', man.
Police don't know nothin'.

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.954
Are they looking?
He's under a court order.

01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:40.112
He bust out, blew up a car,
threatened my kids.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:44.159
The cops are pretty hacked off
at you right now.

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.754
Get on it, Clyde!
It's your job to.

01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:50.037
How am I supposed to? I'm here
babysitting Pandora, man.

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.112
All right, leave her.
She's probably safe there.

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.553
I'll figure it out.

01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:58.269
Leeanne got a call from school,
she about blew her lid.

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.715
You know there's a warrant
out for your arrest?

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.916
- For what?
- For what?!

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.150
Popping that janitor.
He's filed for assault.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.828
I'm not dealing with that
till the cops put Doss away.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.990
This is about
my kids now, Clyde.

01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:15.230
Nobody's gonna harm
either of them!

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.791
Now, you find Doss! I wanna hear
the door slam before I hang up!

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:21.950
- All right.
- [Magruder] Put Mallory on.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.792
He wants to talk to you.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.793
Here's Nervous Nellie himself.
All right, I'm gone, Rick!

01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.193
- Rick, hi.
- Mallory.

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:34.671
L-I never meant for you
to get involved like this.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.189
[Magruder] It's not your fault.
We have to deal with it now.

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.279
Where are you?

01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:44.352
I'm on the road.
Better if no-one knows.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.796
All right. I understand.
How are the kids?

01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:51.395
They're fine. I don't think they
know what's going on.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:56.156
L-I don't think you should
be left on your own.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:00.594
I think you've gotta
come with us,

01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.955
if you don't mind.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:06.030
All right. Whatever you say.

01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:10.591
OK, listen. Take the Greyhound
to Stillwell, off the 25.

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.592
[Magruder] Get a bus at 6:45,
I'll see you at eight.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.148
Now, whatever,
you wait there for me.

01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.708
- What about Clyde?
- Hasn't he gone?

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.950
You on a cellular,
dumb shit?

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.359
I thought you'd gone?

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.874
[Clyde] You know
a cellular gives a signal?

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.793
Get rid of it,
use a hard line.

01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:30.279
Yeah. Will you get movin'?

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.396
Calm your liver.

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:34.789
[Magruder]
Hello? Hello?

01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.233
- Rick?
- Mallory?

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:38.311
- Yeah.
- Is he gone?

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.068
Yeah.

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.435
I better hang up.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.397
Don't... Don't miss that bus.

01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:50.634
I won't.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.550
Libby, Jeff! Let's get movin'!

01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.598
[Drill instructor voice]
Let's get movin' now!

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.113
OK, you strap up, there.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.155
Goin' far, pal?

01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:03.516
I'm getting out of town.
Been in these storms before.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.794
Yeah, looks big.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.871
Well, y'all have a nice trip.

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.510
[Magruder]
Hey, it's room service!

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.875
You going to let Daddy in here?

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.034
Thank you.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.677
All right, we have food!

01:08:11.880 --> 01:08:13.393
Food comin' your way.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.953
[Jeff]
Where's the pizza?

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.759
They didn't have pizza.
Let's enjoy this.

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.035
I'm gonna telephone
your Mommy, OK?

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:27.875
You stay here, enjoy this. This
is good food, you'll love it.

01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.032
What the hell do you mean,
everything's all right?

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:34.953
I mean, you kidnap my kids,
then you punched out a janitor!

01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.474
And now there's a maniac
after my children!

01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.790
That's why I have 'em,
they're safe.

01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:41.198
[Leeanne]
God damn you, Rick!

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:42.872
Bring them home!

01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:45.076
I can't, Leeanne.
Not now, not yet.

01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:46.354
Why the hell not?

01:08:46.439 --> 01:08:49.158
Whether this creep's serious
or not, I don't know,

01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:51.629
but I'm sure as hell
not taking chances.

01:08:52.680 --> 01:08:55.319
I... Leeanne, I should go now.

01:08:55.399 --> 01:08:57.310
[Leeanne]
I'm going to the police.

01:08:57.399 --> 01:08:59.231
There's a warrant out for you.

01:08:59.319 --> 01:09:02.118
This creep's loose and
there's a warrant out on me?!

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:05.272
[Leeanne]
I don't care. You made that bed.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.270
I just want my children back.

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:11.035
As soon as the guy's put away,
we'll come home, I promise.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:13.314
Until then,
it's not safe. I gotta...

01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:22.112
[Shouts]
Libby! Jeff!

01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.194
Libby! Jeff!

01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.871
Libby! Jeff!

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.634
- What is it?
- He's got my kids.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.559
Somebody got in the room.

01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.631
Where would he go? Think!

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.475
Move the car!

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:30.235
You hired me to watch her. Now
she's meeting you? I'm clueless.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.390
Move the car. Doss has my kids!

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.196
What? How?

01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.271
Somebody must've been
following me.

01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.713
- See him?
- No!

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.109
Maybe it was his guys.
Let's find him.

01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:42.670
I got a lead they might
be in his compound.

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:45.069
- You know it?
- His old hunting place.

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.912
- Know where?
- I'll try!

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.629
You go to the police. Meet us at
the compound! Move!

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:53.439
[Clyde]
Careful. That old man's crazy!

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.156
Run my ass over, too!

01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:01.153
Put your belt on.

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:18.031
I was just on the phone.

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.314
It wasn't your fault.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.277
- If anything happens...
- Take this road.

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.432
- I'm not sure.
- Remember!

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:59.232
- I'm trying!
- Think!

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:02.118
- I don't remember!
- Left or right? Think!

01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.350
[Shouts]
Is it left or right, goddamit?

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:05.589
I don't know!

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.555
Left, I think.
Back at that tree.

01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:35.429
[Mallory]
That's his car.

01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:51.072
What're you gonna do?

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.597
You better wait here.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.958
[Voices]

01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:05.268
[Rifle cocks]

01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.919
[Doss]
You're trespassin', lawyer boy.

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.069
You're trespassin'.

01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:09.434
Give me my kids.

01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:10.589
You're trespassin'.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.477
Give me my kids,
you son of a bitch!

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.709
[Gunshots]

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.039
[Shouts]

01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:26.469
The kids. They've got the kids!

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.034
[Shouts]

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.996
[Police sirens]

01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.872
[Police sirens]

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.078
[Magruder]
Libby! Jeff!

01:17:30.800 --> 01:17:32.711
Jeff! Libby!

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.558
[Confused shouting]

01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:37.799
[Clyde]
They're safe.

01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.233
Your kids are safe.

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.799
[Cop]
Drop the gun!

01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:42.438
The kids are safe?

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:45.478
[Clyde] They're at the station,
not a scratch on 'em.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.676
Will you give me the gun, now?

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.718
Throw the gun down!

01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.153
[Cop]
Throw it down, Clyde.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.068
I killed Doss.

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.434
[Cop]
Step over here!

01:18:04.200 --> 01:18:05.235
Now!

01:18:09.320 --> 01:20:00.116
- Slow down!
- How far?

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.071
[Clyde]
All right, come on, Bill!

01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:19.034
[Clyde] Your kids
are at the station, Rick.

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.238
[Clyde]
We dropped them off.

01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:23.758
[Fire roars]

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.956
[Police sirens in distance]

01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.873
[Sirens wail]

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:48.999
Get me the Fire Department.

01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.230
Send an ambulance.
I need back-up.

01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.033
[Cop] Get your hands up!
Get your hands up!

01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:59.032
[Cop]
Lady, get your hands up!

01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:02.236
Step around to the front!

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:03.309
Move!

01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.111
Put your hands on the hood!

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:09.356
It's all right, ma'am.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.396
Easy, Bill.
I know this lady.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.153
- [Cop] Let us do our job.
- [Clyde] I am...

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:19.789
[Clyde] She's good people, man.
Be nice to her.

01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:20.949
[Cop]
Step back!

01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:23.349
[Clyde]
It's all right, ma'am.

01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.431
[Clyde]
Who started this party?

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.953
[Mallory]
I don't know.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:31.033
When they saw he was dead they
just started burning everything.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.238
Just burning everything.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.949
[Clyde] It's all right, I just
wanna ask you some questions.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:45.915
Careful with this guy,
he's a lawyer.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.639
He'll put you away first.
All right, boss?

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:51.994
Self-defence?

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.472
See you at the station.

01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.198
[Clicking of typewriter]

01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.272
[Magruder] He lifted
the gun and started to shoot.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.672
You were trespassing

01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:12.274
and the daughter said
he fired in the air.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:16.156
If I waited to see where
he fired, I'd be dead.

01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:18.117
I thought my kids
were in danger.

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:19.599
[Sheriff]
But they weren't.

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.673
The Founding Fathers established
the right to protect oneself,

01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:27.355
by force if necessary.
Even from lawyers.

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:30.512
And I don't have the right
to protect my kids?

01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:33.319
[Sheriff] They were found here,
safe and sound,

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:34.992
minutes after you called me.

01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:38.314
[Magruder] Somebody took 'em
and dropped 'em off.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.072
They said so themselves.

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.673
[Sheriff]
That's right, somebody.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:44.558
Some tall guy with a beard
and dirty clothes.

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.632
I could spit outside
and hit nine just like that.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.836
Isn't that
a little strange, sir?

01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.512
[Sheriff]
You tell me.

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:57.233
[Whispers] Excuse me,
could I see Mr Magruder's kids?

01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:00.312
Either it was Doss
or one of his group.

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:03.870
They were in on this,
broke him out of state hospital.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.030
That doesn't carry
the death penalty.

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:08.998
Doss came at me
with a 12-gauge shotgun.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.833
So you thought you had to
protect yourself?

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.194
Yes, I did, sir.

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:16.192
But y'all never gave that
courtesy to Officer Watson,

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.111
down in Jacksonville, did you?

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:21.670
You put him on the stand.
He was just protecting himself.

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:25.958
You punched holes the size of
cow chips in a 20-year career.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:30.354
You got yourself in a whole
bucket of shit here, Magruder.

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.115
And if I were you,
I'd find myself a good lawyer.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.796
[Magruder]
I wanna see my kids.

01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.711
My children? Are they all right?

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.234
Yeah, they're fine, they're OK.

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:50.275
Thanks, Lois.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.237
[Crying]
Mommy!

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.196
[Children sob]

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:02.955
[Carl]
OK, kids, it's all right.

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.953
Tell you what, how about
I take you guys to the car...

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:09.475
Don't tell my kids what to do.

01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:10.959
I'm trying to help.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:13.474
Can I talk to you, Rick?

01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.998
The last thing you've ever been
is a father.

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:23.913
And if you can't keep them safe,

01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:28.278
I'll fight tooth and nail for
full custody with no visitation.

01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:32.591
Don't do that, Leeanne.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.272
Please don't do that.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:36.112
[Leeanne]
And do me a favour.

01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:38.760
Keep your white trash tramps
away from my children.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.671
And that drunk pervert too.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.672
Let's go home, honey.
Wave to your daddy.

01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:44.954
Bye, Daddy!

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.550
I'll have to impound the car.

01:22:58.960 --> 01:23:00.234
[Sobs]

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:17.919
You didn't actually see those
kids get in that car, did you?

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.558
I don't know. I thought I did.
I just saw everybody running.

01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.472
It doesn't make sense.

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:33.437
[Clyde]
What's that?

01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:37.798
Why Doss would take my kids,
then release them after an hour.

01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.111
He wasn't after them,
just wanted to use them as bait.

01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.918
To get me on his property?

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:44.513
[Clyde]
Yeah, and kill you.

01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:47.034
With your kids' there,
you're a loose cannon.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.475
Then he drops them
at the police station?

01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.233
Makes kidnapping charges
harder to press,

01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.912
and he's got you trespassin'.

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:56.150
[Magruder]
How could I find him?

01:23:56.240 --> 01:23:59.471
Those cabins were up five miles
of unmarked dirt road.

01:23:59.560 --> 01:24:00.913
[Mallory]
Me.

01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.635
He didn't know you'd come.

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:06.439
The kids were taken
before you arrived.

01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:11.433
[Clyde] Probably figured you'd
call and she'd tell you the way.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.272
Yeah, Daddy didn't figure
I'd be with you.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:20.158
And when he saw me he hesitated.
That's when you shot him.

01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.713
[Deputy]
We've got something.

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:49.076
- What'd you get?
- A box of some kind.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:52.869
[Lawyer] Well, Rick, on the good
side, under these circumstances,

01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:55.872
you might not have
to do any hard time.

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:56.995
Say that again?

01:24:57.080 --> 01:25:00.117
If things go right
you won't go to prison.

01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:02.395
So what's the bad side?

01:25:02.480 --> 01:25:04.630
Well, even without
serving any time

01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:06.836
you're probably
looking at disbarment.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.751
- You serious?
- I'm serious.

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.628
Listen, counsellor, you don't
understand the gravity of this.

01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.119
I understand it, sir.

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.794
Listen to me.
You don't understand it.

01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:19.075
Right here,
under standard 66...

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.912
I know about standard 66.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.037
Even if you plead no contest
and serve no time,

01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:25.633
you can still be disbarred.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:27.915
I don't believe this!
He kidnapped my children!

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:28.989
Wait a minute!

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:32.671
You violated the court order
by taking your own children.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.352
Have you lost your minds?

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.749
Wait, let me clean it off first.

01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.277
It's a metal box.

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:44.994
There's no evidence connecting
Doss to those photos.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.868
- We gotta have something.
- Or that he had the kids.

01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.837
It was someone
they can't identify.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:53.798
Here's how they'll present it.
You put him away...

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.713
I was set up! Got that? Set up!

01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:00.998
You went to his property with a
loaded weapon and you shot him.

01:26:01.080 --> 01:26:02.433
If that weren't enough...

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:03.475
Yeah, what?

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:06.028
That daughter is your client,

01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:08.839
who, rumour has it,
you're sleeping with.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.876
Normally, it wouldn't
be my business...

01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:12.313
It isn't, counsellor.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.391
But I'm obligated to tell you...

01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:16.391
- You're not!
...it'll raise eyebrows.

01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:24.153
[Forensic cop] Can you open it
while I photograph?

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.315
Oh...

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:34.989
[Clyde]
Everything was charred up, Rick.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:37.435
All I could see
was probably Doss's...

01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:41.433
If there's a copy of the will,
there may be an original.

01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:43.272
This is Georgia,
they're held privately.

01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.918
Who else might have one?

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.956
- County?
- That'll take forever.

01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.235
His attorney committed suicide
a while back.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.912
It's a long shot, Lois.

01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.479
He could've kept a copy.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.553
What's that gonna tell us? He
had that old house, some land...

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.312
We need something.
When's his hearing?

01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.674
- Tomorrow.
- Who's presiding?

01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:02.354
- Judge Cooper.
- OK, do it quietly.

01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:04.908
We need more time before
we hand over...

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.471
- What should I do?
- Check anywhere they lived.

01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.516
- For what?
- I don't know!

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.431
But Doss was a hunter, right?

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.556
He had a clean shot at me.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.313
So how come I'm not dead?

01:27:19.800 --> 01:27:22.234
[Clerk] Your land
didn't register as much,

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.436
because there's nothing
really taxable on it.

01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:27.876
No roads, improvements,
limited access.

01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:30.633
Yeah, we know
what's on the tax books.

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.072
I don't get this.

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:37.555
What... exactly is this worth?

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.029
The land? Not much.

01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.951
- But the timber...
- Yeah?

01:27:43.040 --> 01:27:47.591
On this 2,000 acres
is 15 acres of Black Walnut.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:51.829
But they can't tax it
until it's cut down for income.

01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.876
Black Walnut? Isn't that rare?

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.996
- And very valuable.
- How valuable?

01:27:56.080 --> 01:28:00.312
Well, depending upon
the density and the quality,

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:03.949
between 10 and 15
million dollars.

01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:17.076
Counsellor, it's very
difficult to believe

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:19.993
that a man with these assets
had no will.

01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.231
No documentation. Nothing. Nada.

01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:26.392
[Lois] Your Honour, the late
Mr Doss was mentally ill.

01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:28.471
And had a fear of attorneys.

01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:30.312
[Judge]
Don't we all.

01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.272
Miss Doss, in the circumstances
I'm compelled by the law

01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.670
to appoint you as administratrix
of your daddy's estate.

01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:46.556
Only, before I do so I would
like a full search and inventory

01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:49.200
of all his assets and papers

01:28:49.280 --> 01:28:51.794
filed with this court
within 30 days.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.074
Do you understand?

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.275
Yes, Your Honour.

01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.395
Court's adjourned.

01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:01.515
See you later.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:09.755
Rick...

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:13.595
Mallory?

01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:14.795
Hey!

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.518
What's going on?

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.874
What do you mean?

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:20.030
You didn't know
about those trees?

01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.278
No, I don't care what they're
worth. I don't want any of it.

01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:26.713
I'm supposed to buy that?

01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:30.952
I don't care what you buy
or don't buy, Rick.

01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:34.635
But I'll tell you, I hope
there is a will somewhere,

01:29:34.720 --> 01:29:37.029
and he left the whole thing
to those hillbillies.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.789
[Magruder]
If not,

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:43.838
you'll always have
that choice, won't you?

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:50.996
[TV] Good evening,
I'm Natalie Kendricks.

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:55.471
Geraldo, the category three
hurricane, is coming back.

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:58.791
Storm trackers believe Geraldo
is aimed right at us.

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:02.759
If it continues on its current
path, Savannah is the bullseye.

01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:07.312
[Sirens]

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.152
[Phone dials]

01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.395
[Clyde]
Yeah, hello?

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.436
Yeah, Magruder.

01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:15.839
[Clyde]
You sittin' down, partner?

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.875
Why?

01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:21.397
I was at County, runnin' a cross
ref on the old man, and boop!

01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:24.790
Daughter's name's on a marriage
certificate from South Carolina.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:28.236
Well, turns out your girlfriend
and Pete Randle?

01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:30.788
They aren't exactly
husband and ex-wife.

01:30:33.080 --> 01:30:34.433
What are you saying?

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:37.475
What does it sound like
I'm saying?

01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:38.959
They never divorced.

01:30:39.040 --> 01:30:42.430
Never even filed for divorce.
They're as married as can be.

01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:45.471
[Clyde]
Whatever's hers, is his.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.478
Line's goin'. You there? Rick?

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:51.795
Yeah.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:54.232
Yeah, I'm here.

01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:57.908
Where are you now?

01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.433
[Magruder] Huey's Bar, right?

01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:00.589
You know it.

01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.830
How long to get to Mallory's?

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.911
With the rain? 20 minutes.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.558
I'm heading over to Huey's.

01:31:06.640 --> 01:31:09.632
In 45 minutes, I'll call Mallory
with the good news.

01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:11.676
- Good news?
- We found the will.

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:14.592
Wait, I'm behind here, man.

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:17.069
Bait, Clyde.
Let's see what we hook.

01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.310
Go to Mallory's.
Park outside and wait.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.355
[Clyde]
OK.

01:31:20.440 --> 01:31:24.638
She'll go driving after I talk
to her. Follow her and call me.

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:26.953
All right, Boss Man.

01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:31.873
Hey, Robin?

01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:35.439
Robin, I gotta go work, OK?

01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:37.719
You got that $20?

01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:39.950
- Yeah.
- OK, pay the bill.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:42.270
See you later.
Love you, love you.

01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:44.396
[Both]
Love you.

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.671
[Both]
He ain't comin' back!

01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.392
[TV] Death and debris.
Geraldo is here.

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:25.313
This was the Georgia coast
earlier today...

01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.553
[Phone rings]

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:47.515

Hello?

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.273
[On phone] Mallory, it's Rick.
I want to apologise.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:54.278
It was wrong what I said,
I'm real sorry.

01:32:55.880 --> 01:32:57.233
[Mallory]
What do you mean?

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:01.552
We found the will. We haven't
had time to go into the details,

01:33:01.640 --> 01:33:05.758
but you got your wish. Your dad
left everything to the group.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.078
You there, Mallory?

01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.634
That's great.

01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:16.790
I can get you the paperwork...

[Operator] The cellular unit
you called is not responding.

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.676
- Hang up and try again.
- What?

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:15.831
[TV] And those on the streets
right now need to seek shelter.

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:19.195
Thanks.

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.992
What time is it, Sara?

01:34:44.680 --> 01:34:48.639
[TV] It is too dangerous
to be out on the roads.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:49.995
Sara?

01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.958
Give me that phone again.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:15.949
[TV] It's too dangerous
for any of us to be out.

01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.237
Power has gone out
in most of the downtown area.

01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.950
It's far too dangerous
to be out.

Rick! Thank God it's you.

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.517
Listen, we found a copy
of the will in Effingham.

01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:10.953
We should've started there.

01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.234
[Magruder]
And?

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:13.548

in eight years, Rick.

01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:59.917

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:10.558
Subtitles : Filou ;-)
