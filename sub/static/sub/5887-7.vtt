<i>Oh boy, it looks good.</i>

01:08.191 --> 01:11.026
You know what? Why don't
you swing down to Irvine?

01:11.060 --> 01:13.227
We have a lot more
groves down there.

01:13.262 --> 01:15.263
Passenger #2:
Can we go to Tijuana?

01:15.297 --> 01:17.365
I'm tired at looking
at oranges.

01:17.399 --> 01:20.101
Ted: There's more to
look at than the ground.

01:20.136 --> 01:22.403
Imagine what it's like
for the astronauts.

01:22.437 --> 01:24.739
They're probably scared.

01:24.774 --> 01:27.676
Why? Maybe they won't make it.

01:27.710 --> 01:29.877
All their problems
will be over.

01:29.911 --> 01:32.180
You know how to fly this thing?

01:33.215 --> 01:34.715
<i>( engine stops )</i>

01:34.749 --> 01:36.050
What are you doing?

01:36.484 --> 01:39.920
See that spot along 66?
Probably Claremont.

01:39.955 --> 01:41.889
Good spot for
smoldering wreckage.

01:41.923 --> 01:44.792
- It's not funny.
- Turn it back on this minute!

01:44.826 --> 01:47.695
You wanted to go up in the
plane, we went up in the plane.

01:47.729 --> 01:50.363
- My God, we're gonna die!
- ( groaning )

01:50.398 --> 01:53.233
Well, I thought I'd talk
to you privately first,

01:53.267 --> 01:56.103
because your next call is going
to be from Pete Campbell.

01:56.137 --> 01:57.571
Have him call me.

01:58.105 --> 01:59.706
I'd love to hear
his version of it.

01:59.740 --> 02:02.274
Well, Pete says that Sunkist
called him distraught.

02:02.309 --> 02:04.010
( silent )

02:04.044 --> 02:06.445
Severely distraught because
apparently you cut the engines

02:06.480 --> 02:08.648
and scared them half to death.

02:08.681 --> 02:11.283
And also expressed a real
feeling of wanting to die.

02:11.318 --> 02:14.052
He used to fly.
Didn't you ever feel that?

02:14.087 --> 02:16.688
Over Dresden?
I wanted to <i>live.</i>

02:17.023 --> 02:18.623
( yelling ) And the clients
want to live, too, Ted!

02:20.326 --> 02:22.193
I thought this was private.

02:23.329 --> 02:26.164
He's leaving.

02:26.198 --> 02:28.166
Look, Jim, I don't want to die.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.201
I just don't wanna
do this anymore.

02:30.236 --> 02:33.604
- Do what?
- Advertising.

02:33.639 --> 02:35.840
I wanna do something else.
Somewhere else.

02:35.874 --> 02:38.375
- I don't think that's possible.
- <i>Sure, it is.</i>

02:38.410 --> 02:39.811
You're gonna buy me out.

02:39.845 --> 02:41.512
Ted, you don't know
what you're saying.

02:41.547 --> 02:43.748
I've made up my mind.
Goodbye.

02:47.553 --> 02:49.587
( TV playing )

02:49.621 --> 02:51.589
- <i>( intercom buzzes )</i>
- Madeline: <i>Mr. Avery's here.</i>

02:51.623 --> 02:53.424
Send him in.

02:54.892 --> 02:57.794
Just wanted to say
Commander cigarettes is dead.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.431
Leo Burnett says they're rolling it
up with the rest of Philip Morris.

03:00.465 --> 03:02.433
Oh, well, that's too bad.

03:02.867 --> 03:05.535
But I suppose now people will know
we're in the tobacco business again.

03:05.570 --> 03:07.337
- And that's good.
- Oh, sure.

03:07.372 --> 03:09.339
There's a cork-tipped
Newport in the works.

03:09.374 --> 03:11.508
Shall I invite them to "Don
Draper Dinner Theater"?

03:11.542 --> 03:13.610
Maybe a matinee?

03:14.044 --> 03:16.712
10 years I've built
a tobacco resume

03:16.747 --> 03:19.014
and one meeting
turned me into a joke.

03:19.048 --> 03:22.685
I'm gonna crawl outta this place
with nothing left to show.

03:22.719 --> 03:24.420
We don't owe you anything.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.989
You're a hired hand!
Now get back to work.

03:31.995 --> 03:34.229
- <i>( door closes )</i>
- ( huffs )

03:35.832 --> 03:38.434
Bobby! Sally! Get down here!
You're being rude!

03:38.468 --> 03:39.768
But I know I put it in the car.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.870
Neil, that's enough.

03:41.905 --> 03:43.571
"The case of the
missing telescope."

03:44.106 --> 03:45.840
Neil can bunk with Bobby,

03:45.874 --> 03:47.609
and there's a daybed in
the sewing room for Sean.

03:50.446 --> 03:53.715
Sean, Neil.
This is Bobby and Sally.

03:53.749 --> 03:55.149
Where's your little brother?

03:55.184 --> 03:56.351
My goodness, Sally.

03:56.385 --> 03:58.219
You look like your
mother freshman year.

03:58.653 --> 04:00.621
Carolyn, you're the one
with the fully grown men.

04:00.655 --> 04:03.624
- You have such a lovely home.
- Where are we supposed to put these?

04:03.658 --> 04:05.626
I'll show you.

04:06.728 --> 04:08.295
Don't let the lady carry a bag.

04:08.330 --> 04:10.097
Oh, it's fine.
I'm strong.

04:10.131 --> 04:11.365
Let me get it.

04:14.202 --> 04:16.002
Follow me, Rick.

04:18.404 --> 04:20.607
Bobby, show Neil
your telescope.

04:20.641 --> 04:22.609
It'll give you an excuse
to take it out of the box.

04:23.143 --> 04:25.211
You can't see anything
during the daytime.

04:25.245 --> 04:27.046
That's not true.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.914
( sighs )
Come on.

04:32.118 --> 04:34.186
Of course, now that my
partnership is on the table,

04:34.220 --> 04:35.687
Jennifer has stopped
talking about divorce.

04:35.721 --> 04:37.756
She's postponing
the conversation.

04:37.790 --> 04:39.658
Yeah, till after
I get that money.

04:39.692 --> 04:41.759
Don, can you be impartial?
What do I hold out for?

04:41.793 --> 04:44.429
Don't negotiate,
just accept the deal.

04:44.763 --> 04:46.196
Should we take it from the top?

04:48.199 --> 04:50.200
"Welcome, welcome.

04:50.235 --> 04:52.403
Indiana's beautiful
this time of year."

04:52.437 --> 04:54.372
I tell a joke, everyone laughs.

04:54.406 --> 04:57.274
Then Harry gets up and doesn't squander
the good will I've just generated.

04:57.308 --> 05:00.210
- I have a joke, too.
- No, you don't.

05:00.245 --> 05:02.846
"Local buy, national buy,
outdoor."

05:02.881 --> 05:05.648
I tell them about
the IBM 360, but...

05:05.683 --> 05:08.886
I don't show them a picture, because
we only show pictures of ads.

05:08.920 --> 05:10.653
Peggy.

05:11.188 --> 05:14.824
We were scared until we knew the
genuine superiority of Burger Chef.

05:14.859 --> 05:17.326
More general flattery,
research, research.

05:17.361 --> 05:19.629
"Without further ado,
Donald Draper." Don?

05:19.663 --> 05:21.230
Is that what you're
going to say?

05:21.265 --> 05:22.899
Don't worry about what
she's going to say.

05:22.933 --> 05:24.666
I was going to say that...

05:24.701 --> 05:26.635
"Every great ad is a story,

05:26.669 --> 05:28.104
and here to tell you that story

05:28.138 --> 05:30.306
is our creative director
and partner,

05:30.340 --> 05:31.941
Donald Draper."

05:33.810 --> 05:35.511
Don?

05:37.914 --> 05:39.648
( sighs )

05:39.682 --> 05:41.950
"I don't know
about your dinner table,

05:41.984 --> 05:43.518
but I know about mine.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.454
- When I get home--"
- That's fine.

05:46.488 --> 05:49.957
Now we just have to pray everything
goes smoothly on the moon.

05:55.464 --> 05:57.899
Hello?

05:58.967 --> 06:01.068
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:01.602 --> 06:03.037
Where's Kazmir?

06:03.071 --> 06:04.905
He had to run downtown.

06:04.939 --> 06:07.974
Oh.

06:08.008 --> 06:10.043
Well, it looks like
you're doing a good job.

06:10.077 --> 06:11.611
Once you get the grid up,

06:11.646 --> 06:14.080
you just try not
to break the tiles.

06:14.114 --> 06:16.215
I'm Peggy, by the way.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.452
( exhales )
I'm Nick.

06:18.486 --> 06:20.887
You've got a lot of books.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.589
It's so hot in here.

06:22.623 --> 06:24.457
Would you like some iced tea?

06:24.991 --> 06:27.392
Kaz should give you a discount,
your son was a big help.

06:27.427 --> 06:29.428
My son?

06:29.463 --> 06:32.331
Oh, Julio? No, he's my neighbor.

06:32.365 --> 06:33.699
I own the building.

06:33.733 --> 06:36.335
By yourself?

06:36.369 --> 06:38.871
<i>( TV playing )</i>

06:39.305 --> 06:42.007
I was <i>very</i> clear I am not
paying before it's finished.

06:44.543 --> 06:46.110
That's my number.

06:46.144 --> 06:48.279
In case you have any
odd jobs too small for Kaz.

06:49.448 --> 06:51.483
Well, thank you.

06:54.052 --> 06:55.887
- Good night.
- Good night.

06:55.921 --> 06:57.722
Good night, kid.

07:03.495 --> 07:07.063
Can I have a Popsicle?
I only had one today.

07:07.098 --> 07:08.999
Sure.

07:13.004 --> 07:17.340
So then Rutgers promised him a
generous athletic scholarship.

07:17.375 --> 07:19.410
It was nice he had choices,

07:19.444 --> 07:21.578
but I don't see any passion.

07:21.613 --> 07:24.180
I don't remember dreaming of
anything but Paris at his age.

07:24.215 --> 07:26.383
Paris and Ty Power.

07:26.417 --> 07:27.884
How did I marry Rick?

07:27.919 --> 07:30.453
- He has no eyelashes.
- ( laughing )

07:30.987 --> 07:33.188
So...

07:33.223 --> 07:35.825
I have to ask.
Do you ever see Don?

07:35.859 --> 07:38.227
Only when absolutely necessary.

07:38.261 --> 07:41.564
I'm starting to think of him
as an old, bad boyfriend.

07:41.598 --> 07:45.134
Someone a teenage
anthropologist would marry.

07:45.168 --> 07:49.538
- Is there any oatmeal?
- Carolyn: Good morning, mister.

07:49.572 --> 07:51.172
Good morning,
Mrs. Francis.

07:51.206 --> 07:53.274
Betty.

07:53.309 --> 07:55.677
Go get decent.

07:55.711 --> 07:58.647
- Hey, sorry.
- I'm sorry, I'm late.

07:58.681 --> 08:00.248
What can I get you?

08:00.782 --> 08:02.616
She gets to eat
in a bathing suit?

08:02.651 --> 08:05.086
- 'Cause I swim in these shorts.
- I can't eat anything

08:05.120 --> 08:07.588
because I'm a lifeguard
and I can't wait an hour.

08:07.622 --> 08:08.856
Go.

08:14.529 --> 08:16.464
Bye, everyone.

08:20.569 --> 08:22.837
She is so beautiful.

08:22.871 --> 08:24.872
Particularly today.

08:25.306 --> 08:29.208
She's never worn lipstick
to the pool before.

08:29.243 --> 08:31.510
Because before they reach
the surface of the moon,

08:31.544 --> 08:32.811
they're gonna
throw down an anchor.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.480
And what if <i>that</i>
sinks right into it?

08:34.914 --> 08:37.881
Hmm? What if
it's quicksand?

08:37.916 --> 08:40.818
- Am I late for something?
- No.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.654
May I speak with you?

08:56.467 --> 08:58.334
What's going on?

08:58.368 --> 09:00.369
You got this letter
this morning

09:00.404 --> 09:03.807
and it's very upsetting news.

09:07.511 --> 09:09.245
Are they firing you?

09:11.348 --> 09:13.582
I don't know.

09:13.617 --> 09:17.153
What does that mean,
"breach of contract"?

09:17.588 --> 09:18.821
This is from
the agency's attorney.

09:18.855 --> 09:20.155
Why didn't they call me?

09:20.190 --> 09:22.957
Look at you.

09:22.991 --> 09:26.361
You're so confused.

09:26.395 --> 09:29.163
You never even met
with Commander cigarettes.

09:29.198 --> 09:31.399
I would have known.
( sniffles )

09:33.436 --> 09:35.937
- It doesn't matter.
- ( sniffling )

09:40.475 --> 09:42.543
I want you to listen to me.

09:45.313 --> 09:47.748
I know you're
feeling vulnerable,

09:47.782 --> 09:50.684
but I am your strength.

09:59.426 --> 10:03.063
Tell me what I can do.

10:03.097 --> 10:06.667
You can get my
attorney on the phone.

10:06.701 --> 10:08.668
And we can't do this.

10:10.937 --> 10:13.039
You're right.

10:13.073 --> 10:15.908
Not right now.

10:25.618 --> 10:27.786
<i>( door opens, closes )</i>

10:30.523 --> 10:33.023
You think you're gonna throw
me out of my own company?

10:33.058 --> 10:35.125
Madeline, I've got it.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.261
Todd, could you excuse us?

10:37.296 --> 10:39.497
Don has a habit
of walking into meetings

10:39.531 --> 10:41.131
unannounced.

10:41.166 --> 10:44.535
- Should I reschedule?
- Get out!

10:44.970 --> 10:47.104
It was cut and dry.
You broke the stipulations

10:47.138 --> 10:48.505
of the addendum
to your contract.

10:48.539 --> 10:50.407
You set that meeting to
force me out of the agency.

10:50.441 --> 10:52.309
What was I supposed to do?

10:53.777 --> 10:55.878
You know, Ted and I,

10:55.913 --> 10:58.380
whenever we would hear that
your agency was involved,

10:58.415 --> 11:00.883
we'd always be so intimidated.

11:00.918 --> 11:02.418
"What was that man
up to?"

11:02.852 --> 11:05.154
Such a cloud of mystery.

11:05.188 --> 11:07.490
Now that I've been backstage?

11:07.524 --> 11:10.526
I'm <i>deeply</i> unimpressed, Don.

11:10.560 --> 11:12.395
You're just a bully
and a drunk.

11:12.929 --> 11:15.330
A football player in a suit.

11:15.364 --> 11:16.765
The most eloquent
I've ever heard you

11:16.799 --> 11:18.299
was when you were blubbering
like a little girl

11:18.334 --> 11:20.835
about your
impoverished childhood.

11:23.304 --> 11:25.006
What? You wanna
take a swing at me?

11:25.040 --> 11:26.874
It would save us all
a lot of trouble.

11:32.313 --> 11:35.582

11:35.616 --> 11:39.520
- Is he in?
- He hasn't read it, I just got it.

11:39.554 --> 11:41.854
Hey!
Get out here!

11:43.357 --> 11:45.124
- What's going on?
- I just got a breach letter

11:45.159 --> 11:46.659
with your name on the bottom.

11:46.693 --> 11:50.629
- What?
- Joan! Get out here.

11:50.664 --> 11:53.799
Joan! Could you get
Cooper out here?

11:53.833 --> 11:57.070
- What's going on?
- Find Pete.

11:57.104 --> 11:58.971
- No one knows about this?
- I saw it.

11:59.005 --> 12:01.406
Then why did you say,
"What's going on"?

12:01.441 --> 12:03.676
I want you to calm down.
I just called Jim,

12:03.710 --> 12:05.377
we're going to get
to the bottom of this.

12:05.411 --> 12:08.013
- Is there a meeting?
- Have you seen this?

12:08.048 --> 12:09.448
Is this a partners' meeting?

12:09.482 --> 12:11.249
You're not a partner yet.

12:13.653 --> 12:15.120
This is outrageous.

12:15.554 --> 12:17.789
You know we're going to be
at Burger Chef on Monday.

12:17.823 --> 12:19.624
I vote against this.
Right now.

12:19.658 --> 12:21.526
It's not subject to a vote.

12:21.560 --> 12:23.060
The contract was very clear.

12:23.095 --> 12:26.030
You wanna play parliamentary procedure?
Let's play.

12:26.064 --> 12:27.699
Everyone who wants to get
rid of me, raise your hand.

12:27.733 --> 12:30.368
Fine.
I have Ted's proxy.

12:30.402 --> 12:32.336
You had no right
to put my name on that.

12:32.371 --> 12:34.005
Anyone else?

12:36.241 --> 12:38.342
All opposed?

12:39.344 --> 12:42.045
Motion denied.

12:42.479 --> 12:44.948
That is a very sensitive
piece of horseflesh.

12:44.982 --> 12:46.917
He shouldn't be rattled.

12:46.951 --> 12:48.818
He's a pain in the ass.

12:48.852 --> 12:53.589
- You knew about this?
- No. But I'm tired of him costing me money.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.530
We all set those stipulations,
and he signed them.

13:00.564 --> 13:02.831
You shouldn't have done that.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.267
<i>( door closes )</i>

- Can I watch TV?
- I'm sorry, you can't. I'm working.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.734
Wait, get in here.

13:29.173 --> 13:31.775
This is a suit
and it has a skirt

13:31.810 --> 13:34.511
and it has grey in it,
which is what men wear.

13:35.046 --> 13:37.981
And this is a dress
and it's pretty,

13:38.015 --> 13:39.549
but I might be sweating

13:39.583 --> 13:41.852
and not just because it's July.

13:43.687 --> 13:46.055
- Forget it.
- I gotta watch Sunday.

13:46.589 --> 13:47.823
That's when they're
supposed to land.

13:47.857 --> 13:49.725
I'm sorry, but I'm going
to be in Indianapolis.

13:49.759 --> 13:52.227
- Why?
- Because we're presenting to Burger Chef

13:52.261 --> 13:53.995
Monday morning.

13:54.029 --> 13:56.698
I know the astronauts may not make
it, and then what are we gonna say?

13:59.569 --> 14:02.303
Oh.

14:02.338 --> 14:04.305
I'm sorry.

14:04.740 --> 14:07.408
- They're going to be fine.
- It's not fair!

14:07.442 --> 14:08.709
You know what?
I'll give you the key

14:08.744 --> 14:10.844
and you can come down
and watch yourself.

14:10.879 --> 14:12.212
Just don't use the stove again.

14:12.247 --> 14:14.214
I don't wanna go to Newark.

14:14.249 --> 14:18.486
- Nobody does. - My uncle has a house
and he got my mom a job.

14:18.520 --> 14:20.921
I don't wanna leave!

14:21.990 --> 14:24.492
You're moving?

14:31.399 --> 14:33.366
( faintly )
Well...

14:33.401 --> 14:35.435
well, that's okay.

14:37.705 --> 14:39.939
Maybe you'll have a yard.

14:42.976 --> 14:45.178
You want your mom
to have a job, don't you?

14:45.212 --> 14:47.413
She don't care about me.

14:49.183 --> 14:51.818
Yes, she does.

14:51.852 --> 14:54.386
That's why she's moving.

15:02.195 --> 15:03.895
I'll visit you all the time.

15:03.930 --> 15:05.931
No, you won't.

15:08.301 --> 15:11.269
- You can watch TV while I pack.
- Okay.

15:38.596 --> 15:40.664
<i>( phone rings )</i>

15:47.938 --> 15:50.874
- Hello?
- Hello.

15:50.908 --> 15:52.175
What are you up to?

15:52.209 --> 15:54.710
I'm going to the movies
with Jill.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.411
I think we're gonna see
"The Wild Bunch."

15:56.445 --> 15:58.213
I wanna see that.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.782
You want me to wait?

16:00.816 --> 16:01.950
When are you going to Indiana?

16:02.485 --> 16:04.619
I don't even know if I'm going.

16:04.653 --> 16:07.221
What happened?

16:09.392 --> 16:11.025
They're going to fire me.

16:11.059 --> 16:14.796
( sighs )

16:14.830 --> 16:16.398
I'm sorry.

16:16.432 --> 16:19.332
I thought if I kept
my head down and...

16:19.367 --> 16:21.769
did my job--

16:21.803 --> 16:23.404
I guess that's not
what they want.

16:23.438 --> 16:25.806
What <i>do</i> they want?

16:26.775 --> 16:28.542
They want me to move on.

16:30.344 --> 16:33.881
Well, maybe you should.

16:34.415 --> 16:35.982
Aren't you tired of fighting?

16:36.017 --> 16:38.118
Yes.

16:40.054 --> 16:42.455
I guess I could see it
as an opportunity.

16:42.489 --> 16:44.690
I could finally move out there.

16:50.931 --> 16:53.098
( sighs )

16:58.671 --> 17:02.007
- Megan?
- I'm here.

17:03.843 --> 17:05.577
Is that what you want me to do?

17:10.983 --> 17:12.916
Don...

17:18.089 --> 17:20.224
I'll always take care of you.

17:23.363 --> 17:25.696
I'll be fine.

17:26.332 --> 17:30.200
Well, until you are.

17:32.203 --> 17:35.439
Whatever you need.

17:35.473 --> 17:37.240
I owe you that.

17:41.145 --> 17:43.813
You don't owe me anything.

17:54.924 --> 17:57.059
<i>Goodbye, Don.</i>

17:57.094 --> 17:59.495
<i>( line clicks )</i>

18:14.510 --> 18:18.012
- What are we gonna do about Cutler?
- Sit, take off your shoes.

18:18.046 --> 18:19.814
I don't feel like it.

18:19.848 --> 18:22.683
Whoever is in control
is in charge.

18:22.718 --> 18:24.351
We're in control!
We've got the votes--

18:24.385 --> 18:25.920
except for Benedict Joan.

18:25.954 --> 18:29.790
Don cost her a million dollars
when we didn't go public.

18:29.825 --> 18:32.126
So you want him out, too?

18:32.160 --> 18:34.561
Do you understand Don
Draper can work anywhere?

18:35.096 --> 18:39.698
No man has ever come back from leave.
Even Napoleon.

18:39.733 --> 18:42.935
He staged a coup, but he ended
up back on that island.

18:42.969 --> 18:44.937
So why didn't you vote him out?

18:44.971 --> 18:48.807
Because I'm a leader and a
leader is loyal to his team.

18:48.842 --> 18:50.809
Don doesn't understand that.

18:50.844 --> 18:52.945
But I do.

18:52.979 --> 18:56.616
And you have talent and
skill and experience.

18:57.917 --> 19:01.419
- But you're not a leader.
- And Cutler is?

19:01.954 --> 19:06.024
He has a vision,
but he's not on my team.

19:08.193 --> 19:11.295
So, "Let's have another cup of coffee
and let's have another piece of pie"?

<i>Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins</i>

19:35.352 --> 19:37.420
<i>godspeed and a safe return.</i>

19:38.054 --> 19:41.023
Why did you have to do that? Now
I feel like we're in danger.

19:41.057 --> 19:42.524
If they don't make it, we're
going to have to postpone

19:42.558 --> 19:44.959
this thing for a year.

19:49.999 --> 19:53.335
You're going to go in there
and you're going to win this.

19:53.369 --> 19:55.036
And if Cutler doesn't
like it, I'm sorry,

19:55.070 --> 19:56.938
but the Don Draper show is back

19:56.972 --> 20:00.208
from its unscheduled
interruption.

20:00.242 --> 20:03.911
I appreciate that,
but I'm not rattled.

20:03.945 --> 20:06.580
Well, you're sighing a lot.

20:06.615 --> 20:09.149
What do you say you
come out to California?

20:09.684 --> 20:12.319
It's possible if all goes
well that I could be spending

20:12.353 --> 20:13.987
part of my time in New York.

20:14.022 --> 20:17.424
And Ted's going to run that
place into the ground.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.759
He's off the deep end.

20:19.794 --> 20:22.595
Lane Pryce.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.364
There's no reason to go to LA.

20:24.398 --> 20:27.034
Is Megan moving back?

Neil Armstrong: <i>Getting back
up to that first step...</i>

21:00.347 --> 21:02.647
He came out.

- Mission control: <i>Roger. We copy.</i>

21:08.654 --> 21:10.655

pretty good little jump.

Armstrong: <i>I'm at the

The LEM footpads are only

21:41.519 --> 21:46.457
depressed in the surface
about one or two inches,

No.

Yes.

Roger, my condolences.
He was a giant.

Thank you.

He was a wonderful man.

25:25.933 --> 25:29.235
I'll have the obituary
ready in an hour,

It's 1:00

25:38.945 --> 25:41.648
Well, as tragic as this
is, I for one am happy

25:41.682 --> 25:44.317
that we have a chance to have a
conversation with the clients

25:44.351 --> 25:46.152
about the future
of this company.

25:46.187 --> 25:50.557
And to give Don Draper
a send-off along with Bert.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.291
Excuse me?

25:52.325 --> 25:54.626
I hate to remind you that
with Harry's partnership

25:54.661 --> 25:58.430
and without Bert, Don's dismissal
is a foregone conclusion.

25:58.964 --> 26:00.399
Cooper's been dead an hour

26:00.433 --> 26:01.933
and you're prying
his hand open?

26:01.967 --> 26:04.469
Roger, I know what this
company should look like.

26:04.504 --> 26:08.607
Computer services. Media buys
pinpointed with surgical accuracy.

26:08.641 --> 26:11.210
<i>We can offer the services</i>
<i>beyond our clients.</i>

26:11.244 --> 26:13.245
It's the agency of the future.

26:13.279 --> 26:16.081
Is this what would
happen if I died?

26:18.484 --> 26:20.051
( sighs )

26:26.192 --> 26:28.126
<i>( crickets chirping )</i>

26:32.598 --> 26:34.999
Are you the only one out here?

26:35.634 --> 26:37.301
Yes.
Is that okay?

26:37.336 --> 26:40.371
Yeah, I don't want them
giving me shit for smoking.

26:41.573 --> 26:44.842
Smoking causes cancer.

26:49.848 --> 26:52.783
How does it look?
Can you see it?

26:52.817 --> 26:55.919
The moon?
Nah, it's already set.

26:55.954 --> 26:57.755
Then why aren't you
watching TV?

26:59.624 --> 27:03.426
I don't wanna listen to
them or the reporters.

27:03.461 --> 27:06.630
Besides, there's other
things to look at.

27:06.664 --> 27:09.266
Like what?

27:09.300 --> 27:12.201
Polaris.
It's a star.

27:13.203 --> 27:14.804
Take a look.

27:19.877 --> 27:22.245
I can't see anything.

27:22.779 --> 27:24.313
Do you see your eyelashes?

27:24.347 --> 27:26.615
Yes.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.486
Okay.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.456
Tilt your head back and
open your eyes really wide.

27:34.491 --> 27:36.258
Okay.

27:38.094 --> 27:40.061
I think I see it.

27:40.096 --> 27:42.498
Isn't that better than TV?

27:44.367 --> 27:46.968
It is.

27:54.843 --> 27:56.711
What do I do now?

27:57.245 --> 27:59.980
Carolyn: <i>Neil, honey?
Where are you?</i>

28:00.015 --> 28:01.548
I'm outside.

28:01.582 --> 28:03.684
Carolyn: <i>Get in here!
It's bedtime!</i>

28:28.381 --> 28:30.014
<i>Neil, this is Houston.</i>
<i>Did you get the Hasselblad...</i>

28:30.049 --> 28:32.050
( telephone ringing )

28:35.288 --> 28:38.623
- Hello?
- Figured you'd still be up.

28:38.657 --> 28:41.426
Roger?
How'd you find me?

28:41.461 --> 28:44.296
Your itinerary was on
Caroline's desk.

28:44.330 --> 28:47.398
I'm at the office.

28:47.432 --> 28:48.967
Bert passed away.

28:54.372 --> 28:56.540
He was in his living room
on the couch.

28:58.611 --> 29:02.146
Roger, I'm so sorry.

29:02.180 --> 29:05.149
I know what he meant to you.

29:05.183 --> 29:09.253
Well, now I'm
gonna lose you, too.

29:09.287 --> 29:11.355
We don't have
the votes anymore.

29:11.389 --> 29:12.890
It's the first thing
Cutler said.

29:12.925 --> 29:16.392
( sighs )
Well, he's consistent.

29:18.329 --> 29:20.030
Poor Bert.

29:20.564 --> 29:22.098
I should've realized
it was the end.

29:22.133 --> 29:24.467
Every time an old man starts
talking about Napoleon,

29:24.502 --> 29:25.935
you know they're gonna die.

29:28.005 --> 29:29.705
Is his sister still alive?

29:30.841 --> 29:32.542
He was hard on me, you know?

29:32.576 --> 29:34.277
But maybe he was right.

29:36.680 --> 29:40.150
The last thing I said to him
were the lines to some old song.

29:41.985 --> 29:44.521
Come on, Roger, you know
he was very proud of you.

29:46.757 --> 29:48.491
Give 'em hell tomorrow.

29:50.527 --> 29:51.961
Okay.

30:02.072 --> 30:04.040
( sighs )

30:10.180 --> 30:11.613
( sighs )

30:12.248 --> 30:14.849
Aldrin: <i>Okay. The hatch
is closed and latched...</i>

30:16.619 --> 30:18.119
- ( knocking on door )
- <i>( TV playing )</i>

30:24.058 --> 30:25.458
May I speak with you?

30:25.493 --> 30:27.494
Of course.
Is something wrong?

30:27.528 --> 30:30.097
May I come in?

30:36.070 --> 30:38.205
There's been a change of plans.

30:38.239 --> 30:40.974
You're gonna give the
presentation tomorrow.

30:41.009 --> 30:43.310
Did Harry tell you
about my dream?

30:43.344 --> 30:45.379
What? No.

30:45.413 --> 30:48.515
We have a couple hours. You can
practice it with me and still be fresh.

30:50.117 --> 30:53.319
- Are you serious?
- You're gonna be great.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.754
No. Stop
messing around.

30:55.789 --> 30:57.723
It's not funny.

30:57.757 --> 31:00.126
( TV off )

31:00.160 --> 31:01.727
( sighs )

31:01.761 --> 31:04.063
You must have heard that
they're trying to get me out.

31:04.097 --> 31:06.532
If I win this business,
and then I go,

31:06.566 --> 31:08.567
you'll be left with nothing.

31:08.601 --> 31:09.969
They're trying to get you out?

31:10.003 --> 31:13.205
I thought everything was
finally back to normal.

31:13.240 --> 31:15.273
Me, too, but...

31:15.308 --> 31:16.942
sometimes actions
have consequences

31:16.976 --> 31:19.277
and one of them is I
can't present tomorrow.

31:19.312 --> 31:22.915
<i>You</i> win this business
and it will be yours.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.758
No, Don.

31:33.792 --> 31:36.194
It's tomorrow.
I'm unprepared.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.929
You've been listening
to me for weeks.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.464
Well, I can't just say
what <i>you've</i> been saying.

31:40.498 --> 31:43.667
I'm a woman. I'm the
"voice of moms," remember?

31:45.336 --> 31:48.472
Maybe that's better.

31:48.506 --> 31:50.374
Maybe that's the way it
always should have been.

31:50.908 --> 31:52.576
Well, Pete won't stand for it.

31:52.610 --> 31:55.845
Pete's pregnant.
He has to do what we say.

31:57.748 --> 32:00.316
No. Cancel it.
What about the moon landing?

32:00.350 --> 32:02.752
- It was a success.
- No, Don.

32:02.787 --> 32:05.254
I have to talk to people who
just touched the face of God

32:05.289 --> 32:07.457
about hamburgers!

32:07.491 --> 32:09.959
I wouldn't do this if I
didn't know you could.

32:13.330 --> 32:15.131
You've never even
seen me present.

32:15.165 --> 32:17.567
I've overheard things.

32:20.170 --> 32:23.206
We have no liquor.

32:27.711 --> 32:29.712
Good morning.

32:29.746 --> 32:31.379
Did you see we
landed on the moon?

32:31.414 --> 32:34.616
( chuckles )
Is that right?

32:34.650 --> 32:37.251
Neil Armstrong, what are you going
to do with the rest of your life?

32:37.285 --> 32:39.654
Screw every girl
in Florida, I guess.

32:39.688 --> 32:42.423
So you called me at sunrise to
discuss the meaning of life?

32:42.457 --> 32:46.527
No. I just want to know
if Buick had left you yet.

32:46.561 --> 32:47.996
Why would they do that?

32:48.030 --> 32:49.931
Because we've built
a relationship with GM

32:49.965 --> 32:51.599
and they know we can
handle a bigger car.

32:51.633 --> 32:54.534
<i>And</i> our Chevy account
man just moved there.

32:58.239 --> 33:00.107
Uncle.

33:00.141 --> 33:01.942
So, you made the overture.

33:01.976 --> 33:04.077
What did you have in mind?

33:04.612 --> 33:07.747
Well...

33:07.781 --> 33:09.915
we'd want the whole Chevy team.

33:09.950 --> 33:12.152
You, Jim Cutler, Don Draper,

33:12.186 --> 33:14.120
and Ted Chaough.

33:14.154 --> 33:16.656
We both know you're in
the acquisitions business.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.659
I think... you should
buy the whole company.

33:19.693 --> 33:22.161
Because I have a vision.

33:22.795 --> 33:26.231
All our accounts, our
cutting-edge computer,

33:26.266 --> 33:27.999
and the employees that
I know to be worthy

33:28.033 --> 33:30.736
as an independent
subsidiary of McCann.

33:30.770 --> 33:32.371
You just lost Burger
Chef, we may win it.

33:32.405 --> 33:33.739
Then you'd still have it.

33:33.773 --> 33:35.440
And I'd have
my company--

33:35.475 --> 33:38.710
without Jim Cutler and all
that baggage from CGC.

33:40.912 --> 33:44.214
That's an interesting idea.

33:44.249 --> 33:47.518
But this is still
all about Buick.

33:47.552 --> 33:50.788
You have to bury the
hatchet with Ted Chaough.

33:50.822 --> 33:53.023
- Why?
- Because GM thinks he

33:53.057 --> 33:56.427
and Don Draper are one person.

33:56.461 --> 33:58.596
I don't know if I can do that.

33:59.230 --> 34:01.731
Well, then, I don't know
if I can help you.

34:04.902 --> 34:07.336
<i>( low whirring )</i>

34:12.877 --> 34:15.311
( coughs )

34:15.344 --> 34:17.079
<i>( faint voices overlapping )</i>

34:18.081 --> 34:20.650
<i>( whirring continues )</i>

34:22.453 --> 34:24.454
( laughing )

34:41.337 --> 34:42.337
I'm gonna be bold and say

34:42.371 --> 34:44.138
that no one in this room

34:44.172 --> 34:45.672
knows more about the
Burger Chef customer

34:45.708 --> 34:48.509
than Peggy Olson.

34:48.543 --> 34:50.878
She's visited 20 restaurants
in nine states,

34:50.911 --> 34:52.947
interviewed hundreds
and is obviously

34:52.981 --> 34:56.417
uniquely qualified to craft
this modern campaign.

34:58.553 --> 35:02.222
Every great ad tells a story.

35:02.256 --> 35:04.523
Here to tell that story
is Peggy Olson.

35:05.525 --> 35:07.260
Thank you, Don.

35:07.294 --> 35:10.496
That's a lot to live up to.

35:10.530 --> 35:13.399
Because I certainly
can't tell a better story

35:13.433 --> 35:16.535
than the one we saw last night.

35:16.570 --> 35:19.138
I don't know what was
more miraculous--

35:19.173 --> 35:21.074
the technological achievement

35:21.108 --> 35:25.078
that put our species
in a new perspective

35:25.112 --> 35:28.848
or the fact that all of us were doing
the same thing at the same time.

35:28.882 --> 35:31.584
<i>Sitting in this room,</i>

35:31.618 --> 35:35.788
we can still feel the
pleasure of that connection.

35:35.822 --> 35:39.324
Because, I realize now,
we were starved for it.

35:41.026 --> 35:42.160
We really were.

35:43.796 --> 35:48.400
And, yes, we'll feel it again
when they all return safely.

35:49.735 --> 35:54.505
And, yes, the world will never
be the same in some ways.

35:54.539 --> 35:58.275
But tonight, I'm going
to go back to New York,

35:58.310 --> 35:59.777
and I'll go back
to my apartment

35:59.812 --> 36:02.814
and find
a 10-year-old boy

36:02.848 --> 36:06.417
parked in front
of my TV, eating dinner.

36:08.886 --> 36:12.756
Now, I don't need to charge
you for a research report

36:12.790 --> 36:15.359
that tells you that
most television sets

36:15.393 --> 36:19.362
are not more than six feet
away from the dinner table.

36:19.396 --> 36:21.664
And that dinner table

36:21.699 --> 36:24.267
is your battlefield
and your prize.

36:25.937 --> 36:28.739
This is the home your
customers really live in.

36:28.773 --> 36:31.241
This is <i>your</i> dinner table.

36:31.275 --> 36:34.778
Dad likes Sinatra,
son likes The Rolling Stones.

36:35.412 --> 36:40.717
The TV's always on, Vietnam
playing in the background.

36:40.751 --> 36:44.387
The news wins every night.

36:44.421 --> 36:47.156
And you're starving.

36:47.190 --> 36:49.758
And not just for dinner.

36:56.132 --> 36:58.868
What if there
was another table,

36:58.902 --> 37:02.238
where everybody gets what
they want when they want it?

37:03.206 --> 37:05.975
<i>It's bright and clean,</i>

37:06.009 --> 37:07.776
and there's no laundry,

37:07.810 --> 37:12.013
no telephone, and no TV.

37:12.047 --> 37:14.949
And we can have the connection

37:14.984 --> 37:16.985
that we're hungry for.

37:19.788 --> 37:23.591
There may be chaos at home,

37:26.294 --> 37:29.563
but there's family supper
at Burger Chef.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.435
That's beautiful.

37:39.607 --> 37:41.308
That's nice to hear

37:41.342 --> 37:43.776
because that's
the name of the spot.

37:46.314 --> 37:47.747
( chuckling )

37:56.391 --> 38:00.494
We open on a bird's-eye view
of a typical kitchen table.

38:00.528 --> 38:01.928
<i>( elevator bell pings )</i>

38:08.535 --> 38:10.769
- Welcome home.
- How'd you get in here?

38:10.803 --> 38:12.838
Money. But he wouldn't
open the door.

38:12.872 --> 38:14.973
I need to talk to ya.

38:15.008 --> 38:16.442
Cooper still dead?

38:16.476 --> 38:18.910
His situation hasn't
changed, but ours has.

38:18.945 --> 38:20.646
Can I get a drink?

38:25.285 --> 38:28.320
- Roger: How'd it go?
- Great.

38:28.355 --> 38:31.256
That why you're here?

38:31.290 --> 38:34.325
We got an offer from McCann
Erickson to buy the agency.

38:34.360 --> 38:38.596
Hear me out. We'd be a
subsidiary, separately operated.

38:38.631 --> 38:40.799
We keep our name, our
offices, you keep your job--

38:40.833 --> 38:43.735
your real job-- and
I'll be the president.

38:44.270 --> 38:46.971
- Of McCann?
- No, of Sterling Cooper.

38:47.005 --> 38:48.306
They know we're primed
for a big car,

38:48.340 --> 38:50.007
and they don't want
to compete with us.

38:50.042 --> 38:52.544
Did you forget we started <i>this
</i> agency to get away from them?

38:52.578 --> 38:55.246
Yeah, I know that. But a
lot's happened in between.

38:55.281 --> 38:57.248
Most of it good,
but some of it very bad.

38:57.283 --> 38:59.651
Without Cooper, Cutler's gonna lock
you out by the end of the week.

38:59.685 --> 39:02.453
- I don't want to work for McCann.
- You're gonna work for <i>me.</i>

39:02.488 --> 39:05.823
Don't fool yourself. You know
they're not gonna leave us alone.

39:05.857 --> 39:09.927
They did with Marschalk. And they're buying 51%.
You're gonna make a fortune.

39:09.961 --> 39:12.730
Fine, you have my vote.
What's that gonna do?

39:12.764 --> 39:14.999
You can't even save my job, how
are you gonna sell the company?

39:15.033 --> 39:18.335
I'm working on it. You're
of essence to the deal.

39:20.172 --> 39:22.639
But so is Ted Chaough.

39:22.674 --> 39:24.208
Ted Chaough?
What are you doing?

39:24.242 --> 39:26.443
They want the guys
who won Chevy.

39:26.477 --> 39:30.047
Roger, I just wanna do my work. I don't
wanna deal with business anymore.

39:30.082 --> 39:32.583
And what about everyone else?
We all send out resumes?

39:32.617 --> 39:36.553
Cutler's not gonna stop until the
firm is just Harry and the computer.

39:36.588 --> 39:38.756
That means everybody goes.

39:40.992 --> 39:42.960
And you know it.

39:43.962 --> 39:45.762
<i>( door closes )</i>

39:47.891 --> 39:50.526
- ( raps )
- Ted, welcome back.

39:50.561 --> 39:52.228
Well, I'm sorry it's under
these circumstances.

39:52.262 --> 39:54.863
I've instructed Don to
gather everyone at noon.

39:54.898 --> 39:56.666
Did you want to
discuss the remarks?

39:56.700 --> 39:59.902
I thought we would begin with
a poem of memorial for Bert.

39:59.936 --> 40:01.937
"O Captain, My Captain"?

40:01.971 --> 40:03.772
Then we have a lot
of pressing business here

40:03.807 --> 40:05.407
with finalizing Don's
departure and--

40:05.441 --> 40:07.242
And I have an
announcement of my own.

40:07.276 --> 40:09.578
We don't need
to deal with that today.

40:10.680 --> 40:12.447
I haven't heard anything.

40:12.481 --> 40:15.584
- About what?
- Burger Chef.

40:17.053 --> 40:19.722
- Good morning.
- I'm glad that you're here.

40:19.756 --> 40:21.389
Would you please
all have a seat?

40:21.424 --> 40:24.626
There's coffee. I have some
rather urgent business.

40:25.628 --> 40:27.629
I insist.

40:38.307 --> 40:40.942
I'm coming to all of you
with an incredible opportunity.

40:40.976 --> 40:44.645
McCann Erickson wants
to buy a 51% stake in SC&P.

40:44.679 --> 40:46.413
We'll be independently operated,

40:46.448 --> 40:48.415
and all they ask are
five-year contracts

40:48.450 --> 40:50.050
from everyone.

40:50.084 --> 40:52.853
- Including Don?
- Especially Don.

40:52.887 --> 40:54.988
And you'll be our king.

40:55.022 --> 40:57.658
Well, I did put it together.

40:57.692 --> 40:59.159
The details have
to be worked out,

40:59.193 --> 41:02.763
but we'll keep our office,
our name, and our clients.

41:02.797 --> 41:05.799
- Why would they do that?
- Because we finally turned this place

41:05.833 --> 41:09.102
into a legitimate threat and they'd like
to neutralize it with cold, hard cash.

41:09.137 --> 41:11.304
- How much?
- When did you do this?

41:11.338 --> 41:13.573
Since you asked, I'll
use you as an example.

41:13.607 --> 41:16.243
Let's say they value
the agency at $65 million

41:16.277 --> 41:17.878
and they buy 51% of it.

41:17.912 --> 41:21.982
That means your 5% share's worth
a little over $1.5 million.

41:22.016 --> 41:25.584
- <i>25% of that upon signing.</i>
- Oh, my goodness.

41:25.618 --> 41:27.853
I've got 10%!

41:27.888 --> 41:29.454
Keep counting those chickens.

41:29.489 --> 41:32.391
I hope you all realize this is a
pathetic ploy and a delusion.

41:32.425 --> 41:35.161
It is until everybody
votes on it.

41:35.195 --> 41:37.830
Sorry, just heard
about the partners' meeting.

41:37.864 --> 41:40.666
- Perfect timing.
- He hasn't signed. He missed the boat.

41:40.700 --> 41:42.701
- What's going on?
- None of your beeswax.

41:42.735 --> 41:45.303
- I'll take the deal.
- Goodbye, Harry.

41:45.337 --> 41:47.438
Don't worry about it.

41:50.609 --> 41:53.678
- Well, I won't do it.
- That's fine because you're not of essence.

41:53.712 --> 41:58.149
- And you <i>are?</i> - Yes, all they care about
is me, Don, and Ted.

41:58.184 --> 42:01.953
Don, you're gonna sign a contract
to work at McCann for five years?

42:01.987 --> 42:06.024
- Well, I've given this a lot of thought.
- I'm sure you did.

42:06.058 --> 42:08.292
And I agree with Roger that we
should do everything we can

42:08.327 --> 42:11.529
to keep Jim from
breaking up the agency.

42:11.563 --> 42:13.197
You mean, save your hide.

42:13.231 --> 42:14.799
Look, I don't want
to stand in the way

42:14.833 --> 42:16.200
of everyone making
all this money,

42:16.234 --> 42:18.436
but I am done with advertising.

42:18.470 --> 42:21.739
Your 20% share will
be worth at least $6 million.

42:21.773 --> 42:23.674
I'm going to have
plenty of money

42:23.709 --> 42:25.776
from selling my
partnership as it stands.

42:25.811 --> 42:27.110
Can't you do it without me?

42:27.145 --> 42:29.078
You don't think I tried that?

42:29.112 --> 42:31.080
If I sign a contract
for five years,

42:31.114 --> 42:33.383
that'll be the rest of my life.

42:33.417 --> 42:37.520
- You've got to be kidding me.
- You're not just pathetic, you're selfish.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.422
Well, I'm sorry, Roger.

42:39.457 --> 42:42.191
You may have the votes,
but you don't have a deal.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.827
Now can we dispense
with this nonsense,

42:43.861 --> 42:46.262
go outside and say
a fond farewell?

42:48.566 --> 42:50.031
Ted.

42:51.934 --> 42:53.935
What if I told you that
you could just write copy

42:53.970 --> 42:56.137
and fight clients
and not worry about

42:56.172 --> 42:58.841
partnership votes
or stock prices?

42:58.875 --> 43:00.576
You could just
go back to creative.

43:00.610 --> 43:02.778
I have that right now,
and I'm miserable.

43:02.812 --> 43:04.613
No, you don't.

43:04.647 --> 43:06.749
I really lost this last year

43:06.783 --> 43:09.684
and I realized I would do
anything to get back in.

43:09.718 --> 43:10.818
And I did anything.

43:10.853 --> 43:13.788
I wrote tags, I wrote coupons.

43:13.822 --> 43:17.958
Things I haven't done
since I first got my start.

43:17.993 --> 43:22.196
I know you. I know the man who
I walked into Chevy with.

43:23.198 --> 43:25.132
You don't have to work for us,

43:25.166 --> 43:27.435
but you have to work.

43:29.104 --> 43:32.239
You don't wanna see what
happens when it's really gone.

43:32.274 --> 43:35.976
You remember the last time he
talked you into something?

43:39.381 --> 43:41.415
I don't know.

43:47.054 --> 43:50.256
- So, I'd move back to the city?
- Ted's in. Let's have a vote.

43:50.291 --> 43:52.191
- Hold on.
- Let's have a vote.

43:52.226 --> 43:54.227
Everyone in favor.

43:57.965 --> 43:59.198
( sighs )

44:04.170 --> 44:05.471
Really?

44:05.505 --> 44:08.307
It's a lot of money.

44:09.676 --> 44:11.677
( voices overlapping )

44:21.721 --> 44:23.055
I just got off the phone
with Burger Chef.

44:23.089 --> 44:25.457
They couldn't find anyone.

44:25.491 --> 44:28.593
We got it.

44:28.627 --> 44:31.029
Well, they heard what I heard.

44:35.601 --> 44:37.602
Where are you going?

44:37.636 --> 44:39.637
Back to work.

44:41.341 --> 44:44.208
Dawn: <i>Excuse me, everyone. If
I could have your attention.</i>

44:44.242 --> 44:48.245
Mr. Sterling would like
to make an announcement.

44:48.280 --> 44:50.881
Thank you, everyone.

44:50.915 --> 44:53.384
It's difficult that at this
moment of national pride,

44:53.418 --> 44:56.720
we have to deal with
some sad, personal news.

44:56.721 --> 44:58.535
On Sunday night we
lost our founder...
