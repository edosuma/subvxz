00:01.530 --> 00:04.366
-

00:31.461 --> 00:36.464
-

00:43.803 --> 00:47.112
-

01:19.410 --> 01:21.410
I've been dreaming
about this day forever,

01:21.445 --> 01:22.807
like every girl, I guess.

01:23.810 --> 01:25.678
Viktor wasn't so
enthusiastic, though.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.549
Those Catholic ceremonies
are so beautiful.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.157
Look, I wanted
to show you the church

01:32.192 --> 01:33.191
where we're getting married.

01:34.722 --> 01:36.392
- Here.
-  Mm.

01:37.527 --> 01:40.429
Oh, Zhenya it's so beautiful.

01:40.695 --> 01:43.498
I bet you wore
the most beautiful dress
at your own wedding.

01:44.633 --> 01:45.863
I didn't have a wedding.

01:46.800 --> 01:48.404
Sonya,
can you please stay still?

01:48.439 --> 01:49.702
I need to fix this piece.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.243
Oh, oh, oh Vit, no.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.377
What are you doing?
You know it's bad luck.

01:54.412 --> 01:56.214
You know I don't
believe in that stuff.

01:56.249 --> 01:57.809
How much longer will you be?
Hi.

01:57.943 --> 02:00.350
Let me introduce you.
Vitya, Zhenya.

02:00.385 --> 02:01.780
- Hello.
-

02:05.951 --> 02:07.753
Continue, I'll get her.

02:08.624 --> 02:12.131
He's practicing.
-

02:28.677 --> 02:33.284
-

02:55.704 --> 02:59.442
-  Shh, shh.

03:07.881 --> 03:10.915
-

03:56.831 --> 03:58.699
- Okay, enough.
-

04:01.033 --> 04:02.604
I told you not to come here.

04:02.936 --> 04:06.344
-

04:18.391 --> 04:20.424
-

04:38.972 --> 04:42.446
Zhenya, what happened?

04:50.390 --> 04:51.785
Come on, don't be silly.

04:52.359 --> 04:53.655
You can't change what happened.

04:55.054 --> 04:56.922
Believe me, he'll love you
more than before.

04:57.793 --> 04:59.056
It could happen to anyone.

04:59.696 --> 05:01.399
You should just tell him
you didn't see anything.

05:02.127 --> 05:03.335
Mm.

05:05.405 --> 05:06.668
The guy just lost it.

05:31.057 --> 05:33.728
Okay, enough, enough.

05:34.863 --> 05:36.368
Stop torturing yourself.

05:36.997 --> 05:38.568
You can't force him to stay.

05:42.739 --> 05:44.376
Forget about him, Evgenia.

05:44.741 --> 05:45.773
Get him out of your head.

06:02.462 --> 06:04.561
I don't want Polina to grow up
without a father.

06:06.499 --> 06:07.663
Everyone makes mistakes.

06:08.798 --> 06:09.929
Anyone can mess up.

06:14.804 --> 06:15.803
Here.

06:18.038 --> 06:19.807
You can't force someone
to love you.

06:21.074 --> 06:22.975
Unless you cast
a love spell, of course.

06:34.153 --> 06:36.824
Hello Elena, is Kir home?

06:38.828 --> 06:39.827
What's happened?

06:40.729 --> 06:42.093
I've just come by
to drop off his stuff.

06:43.129 --> 06:44.964
He promised to stop by
and pick it up,

06:44.999 --> 06:47.098
but he's been ignoring my calls
for three days.

06:47.133 --> 06:48.132
That's odd.

06:49.335 --> 06:52.136
I thought you always knew
where Kirill was and who with.

06:53.909 --> 06:55.447
Just there please.

06:55.482 --> 06:56.745
I'll see he gets it.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.718
What are you doing?

07:03.754 --> 07:05.017
I thought you'd come
get your things.

07:05.492 --> 07:06.491
Didn't have time

07:08.154 --> 07:09.153
We need to talk.

07:24.544 --> 07:26.676
You can see other girls

07:28.812 --> 07:31.142
if that's what you need for
your life and your creativity.

07:33.982 --> 07:35.487
We can handle it, right?

07:35.687 --> 07:37.082
Yeah, well, there's no us.

07:37.953 --> 07:39.590
You're suffocating me,
all right?

07:41.693 --> 07:42.890
Of course there's an us.

07:43.959 --> 07:45.596
There's you, there's me,
and Polina.

07:47.127 --> 07:48.126
And what?

07:49.195 --> 07:51.635
You think you own me
because I got you pregnant?

07:53.001 --> 07:55.474
-

07:55.641 --> 07:56.640
Get off, idiot.

08:03.011 --> 08:04.010
Get outta here.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.630
-

09:22.794 --> 09:24.255
Oh, come in, dear.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.026
I was starting to think
you got lost.

09:26.864 --> 09:28.699
Help me out. Go on.

09:30.835 --> 09:31.834
Don't be scared.

09:37.974 --> 09:39.072
Be honest.

09:39.107 --> 09:40.238
Don't play games with me.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.108
Are you ready to go all the way

09:42.682 --> 09:44.616
or is it just a matter of pride?

09:47.984 --> 09:48.983
You love him?

09:49.249 --> 09:50.853
You wanna be with him forever?

09:52.252 --> 09:53.724
- Mm-hm.
- Mm.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.022
That's what really matters.

09:57.796 --> 10:00.632
Do you have a friend
getting married soon?

10:02.427 --> 10:04.295
Yeah, but most of them
are actually already married.

10:04.330 --> 10:05.395
You have to find one.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.133
One whose love is very strong.

10:07.432 --> 10:09.201
Spirits feed on true feelings.

10:11.678 --> 10:13.777
Trust me,
you don't want to trick them.

10:16.177 --> 10:18.078
Throw the salt
in four directions.

10:19.048 --> 10:20.344
You have to learn it by heart.

10:20.819 --> 10:23.215
Don't change the order,
don't stumble.

10:25.758 --> 10:27.054
You have to do it in a church.

10:27.089 --> 10:28.759
It's easier
to reach the spirits there.

10:31.357 --> 10:32.664
Do it during their wedding.

10:32.699 --> 10:33.896
How much do I owe you?

10:33.931 --> 10:35.931
How much are you ready to pay
for you love?

10:39.266 --> 10:40.265
Just remember,

10:44.073 --> 10:46.304
if you lied to me
and your love is fake,

10:46.339 --> 10:47.778
the spirits won't forgive you.

10:49.881 --> 10:51.375
If he loves you,
he'll come back.

10:52.180 --> 10:54.917
If he doesn't,
don't expect anything good.

10:56.316 --> 10:58.184
-

10:59.154 --> 11:00.923
Blood will make the spell
stronger.

11:01.321 --> 11:02.991
Cast it
until the meat's spoiled.

11:08.801 --> 11:09.861
You'll be bound by blood.

11:13.938 --> 11:15.432
Unless you change your mind.

11:18.844 --> 11:22.340
a mockingbird

11:22.947 --> 11:26.850
baby dear

11:27.116 --> 11:30.986
will be near

11:43.198 --> 11:45.803
-

12:05.484 --> 12:08.023
- Hi.
- Oleg, you shouldn't be here.

13:25.234 --> 13:27.938
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

13:27.973 --> 13:32.272
to witness the union of Viktor
and Sophia in holy matrimony.

13:34.639 --> 13:36.045
Marriage is sacred.

13:37.213 --> 13:39.147
No one should
enter into it hastily.

13:39.644 --> 13:43.250
One must enter into a marriage
with devotion and discretion.

13:46.519 --> 13:49.927
Dear Lord,
our most merciful Father.

13:50.655 --> 13:53.227
You embody the truth,
love, and life.

13:53.262 --> 13:55.427
Your kindness
fills the universe.

13:56.628 --> 13:59.167
I place my soul
into this first candle.

13:59.499 --> 14:01.466
Make us, Kirill and Evgenia,

14:01.501 --> 14:03.567
intertwined like
these two candles.

14:06.275 --> 14:09.177
Beloved son, Viktor, and Sophia,

14:09.916 --> 14:12.576
is your wish today
to be joined in holy matrimony

14:12.611 --> 14:15.348
before this congregation
genuine and willful?

14:16.285 --> 14:17.084
- Yes.
- Yes.

14:17.451 --> 14:19.319
Kirill's soul
is placed in the second.

14:20.091 --> 14:21.926
Make him stay with me forever.

14:22.456 --> 14:25.622
Make him loyal and devoted
only to you.

14:26.229 --> 14:27.360
Make him honest.

14:29.463 --> 14:32.002
Make him loyal and devoted
only to me

14:32.532 --> 14:34.565
and by lighting these candles,

14:34.600 --> 14:36.270
I ignite Kirill's heart
and soul.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.239
Make him think of me.

14:39.110 --> 14:40.340
Make him love me.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.507
Do you promise
to be true to each other

14:42.542 --> 14:44.146
for better or for worse?

14:44.577 --> 14:45.576
Yes.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.546
The first candle yours.

14:49.318 --> 14:50.581
The second candle mine.

14:59.394 --> 15:01.427
You are mine and I am yours.

15:02.529 --> 15:04.265
You are mine and I am yours.

15:06.566 --> 15:08.500
You are mine and I am yours.

15:11.175 --> 15:13.175
Both in sickness and in health?

15:13.738 --> 15:14.946
Yes.

15:18.347 --> 15:20.116
You are mine and I am yours.

15:35.265 --> 15:38.035
Here and now, I confirm
and bless your marriage,

15:38.763 --> 15:42.402
but what God has joined,
let no man separate.

15:44.274 --> 15:45.504
In the name of the Father,

15:46.540 --> 15:47.539
and the Son,

15:50.676 --> 15:52.148
and the Holy Spirit.

16:46.666 --> 16:49.238
-

17:02.418 --> 17:03.417
What?

17:08.226 --> 17:09.225
It's okay.

17:10.426 --> 17:11.557
It's just nerves.

17:58.309 --> 17:59.308
Zhenya!

18:12.653 --> 18:15.621
-

18:21.563 --> 18:23.101
This is very bad luck

18:26.535 --> 18:27.666
and you know that.

19:19.786 --> 19:21.192
Zhenya, can you hear me?

19:23.295 --> 19:24.690
You're gonna breathe
by yourself now.

19:27.728 --> 19:28.727
There we go.

19:29.697 --> 19:31.598
- Careful, that's good.

19:38.541 --> 19:40.244
You had an acute infection.

19:40.774 --> 19:41.872
Everything's fine now.

19:42.908 --> 19:44.380
Would you like to call someone?

19:45.383 --> 19:48.252
Your family? Your daughter,
where is she now?

19:48.518 --> 19:49.517
She's with my mom.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.486
Don't call anyone.

19:53.391 --> 19:54.555
I just need to go home.

19:54.821 --> 19:57.360
Tomorrow.
You need some rest until then.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.924
Viktor, I'm so, so sorry.

20:00.959 --> 20:03.300
Please forgive me.
I ruined your wedding.

20:04.798 --> 20:05.797
Rest.

20:38.766 --> 20:42.273
Vitya, Vit, I'm sorry,
please, please wait.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.538
I don't know how it happened.

20:43.573 --> 20:44.704
I'm begging you, Viktor.

20:44.739 --> 20:46.310
Please, forgive me.

20:46.345 --> 20:48.510
Please don't go! Vitya!

21:36.021 --> 21:38.054
-

21:53.038 --> 21:54.906
-

22:01.453 --> 22:02.551
What are you doing here?

22:05.116 --> 22:06.456
You were in my dream.

22:07.987 --> 22:09.987
Calling me.
It was strange. I...

22:11.056 --> 22:13.089
spent the rest of the day
thinking about you.

22:15.599 --> 22:16.498
You were right.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.469
We should be together.
We'll get through this.

22:24.608 --> 22:25.607
Forgive me?

22:31.142 --> 22:32.350
I do.

24:42.647 --> 24:43.745
You scared me.

24:54.791 --> 24:55.922
You're so beautiful.

24:59.191 --> 25:00.498
Like a bride.

25:03.668 --> 25:04.667
The light on you.

25:06.836 --> 25:07.835
Stand there.

25:56.952 --> 25:58.050
Hi, Mom.

25:59.383 --> 26:01.053
Don't worry,
we'll be there soon.

26:04.289 --> 26:05.827
Something happened
during the storm.

26:07.028 --> 26:08.324
Let's go get Polina?

26:59.685 --> 27:00.783
I guess it was the wind.

27:01.919 --> 27:03.918
We should have gotten rid of all
of this a long time ago.

27:06.153 --> 27:09.924
I'll board it up now and
put in a new one later.

27:12.225 --> 27:14.324
Mom, maybe you can
stay with us for a while?

27:14.359 --> 27:15.963
I wouldn't wanna bother,
sweetheart.

27:15.998 --> 27:17.096
You've got your own family.

27:17.263 --> 27:18.966
But you're also
a part of the family,

27:19.265 --> 27:21.001
- right, Kirill?
-

27:22.400 --> 27:24.169
Well,
maybe for a few days.

27:30.848 --> 27:31.946
Uh, could you tell me, Kirill--

27:31.981 --> 27:33.376
You'd be bothering us.

27:37.052 --> 27:38.051
What?

27:39.021 --> 27:40.922
I said, you'd be bothering us.

27:45.060 --> 27:46.389
Mom, taxi's already here.

27:47.326 --> 27:48.325
Go get ready.

27:50.164 --> 27:51.295
What about the garden, dear?

27:51.330 --> 27:52.802
Who'll take care of my garden?

27:53.497 --> 27:55.200
No, honey, I'm staying.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.774
Maybe you and Polina
can stay here

27:57.809 --> 27:59.809
just as a change of scenery
to relax.

28:00.075 --> 28:01.844
But there are
some things to do at home.

28:02.913 --> 28:04.748
We'd love to
spend some time together.

28:07.082 --> 28:08.147
Okay.

28:57.198 --> 28:58.527
Hey, what are you doing?

28:58.562 --> 29:00.133
I've got work today.

29:00.168 --> 29:01.332
I don't understand.

29:02.038 --> 29:04.401
It's all much more perfect
in real life.

29:07.373 --> 29:08.372
Wait.

29:11.443 --> 29:13.784
Kirill, I need to get going.

29:18.956 --> 29:20.351
You don't have to work anymore.

29:24.192 --> 29:25.796
It distracts you.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.901
Nobody should distract us.

29:35.071 --> 29:36.532
We'll be together always.

29:38.140 --> 29:39.172
Do you understand?

29:40.373 --> 29:41.537
Just you and me.

29:48.414 --> 29:51.789
Shh, easy, babe, you can't move.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.519
She's asleep.

30:56.383 --> 30:59.186
I'm yours and you're mine.

31:00.959 --> 31:02.486
Just like you wanted.

31:44.101 --> 31:45.397
Why won't you cut me
some slack?

31:45.432 --> 31:46.398
I've only worn it once.

31:47.973 --> 31:49.940
You know,
every bride wears her dress once

31:49.975 --> 31:51.007
if she's lucky.

31:52.538 --> 31:55.341
Maybe you can refund me half
or rent it somehow?

31:55.376 --> 31:57.145
Sonya, what's the matter?

31:58.346 --> 32:00.115
Nothing's wrong.
Take your dress.

32:01.052 --> 32:02.348
Wait, is there a problem?

32:02.581 --> 32:04.515
- Maybe I can help you.
- You already did.

32:04.748 --> 32:06.451
He broke up with me
on my wedding day.

32:07.993 --> 32:08.992
Sonya.

32:09.995 --> 32:11.093
Why the hell
did you show up at our wedding?

32:15.528 --> 32:16.967
Kate, let's process this dress

32:17.002 --> 32:18.397
as a canceled order, please.

32:38.683 --> 32:39.682
Hello.

32:40.851 --> 32:43.686
Um, I came to see you last week
about the love spell.

32:47.131 --> 32:47.797
He's yours now.

32:47.832 --> 32:49.263
- What?

32:53.269 --> 32:54.532
-

34:05.341 --> 34:07.341
-

34:13.877 --> 34:15.085
What's wrong?

34:15.615 --> 34:16.614
Nothing.

34:17.749 --> 34:19.518
Listen,
I've asked about the dress.

34:19.553 --> 34:23.126
We'll have to return the money
to his credit card

34:23.755 --> 34:25.623
because he used it
to pay for the dress.

34:25.856 --> 34:27.361
So, are we doing the refund?

34:27.396 --> 34:28.395
Yeah, yeah.

34:38.539 --> 34:40.836
Kir, I'm home.

35:36.300 --> 35:37.299
Polina?

35:37.697 --> 35:39.169
Polina, sweetie.

35:40.799 --> 35:42.799
There, there, it's okay.

35:43.736 --> 35:44.834
Shh.

35:46.739 --> 35:47.837
Quiet, quiet.

35:49.841 --> 35:51.445
Kirill,
are you out of your mind?

35:51.843 --> 35:53.183
Was she here all alone?

35:53.977 --> 35:55.416
Baby, come on.

35:58.718 --> 36:00.256
Nothing happened.

36:00.291 --> 36:01.389
I was busy.

36:01.424 --> 36:02.819
You said you'd be back soon.

36:03.558 --> 36:05.690
I thought something changed
when you came back.

36:06.792 --> 36:08.396
I thought you really loved us.

36:08.596 --> 36:13.533
Babe, I love you, but
you're always somewhere else.

36:13.568 --> 36:15.370
You're always going somewhere,

36:15.570 --> 36:17.603
either to work
or somewhere else.

36:17.902 --> 36:20.870
We need to eliminate
everything that's unnecessary.

36:21.378 --> 36:23.906
See, I don't wanna share you
with anyone.

36:25.910 --> 36:27.646
Please, don't leave me
like that again.

36:29.584 --> 36:30.383
Stay with me.

36:31.883 --> 36:34.785
I'm yours,
but I'm not your property.

36:34.820 --> 36:35.951
I can't live like this.

36:37.262 --> 36:39.262
You're my wife.
You must.

36:39.825 --> 36:40.824
I'm not your wife.

36:43.565 --> 36:44.597
-

36:47.833 --> 36:51.406
Please, sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you.

36:51.441 --> 36:52.539
I--I just...

36:53.872 --> 36:56.312
There, there, forgive me.

36:57.348 --> 36:58.347
Shh.

37:03.288 --> 37:05.585
-

37:15.960 --> 37:17.960
- Hello?
-  Hey,
your mom stopped by.

37:17.995 --> 37:19.368
She took Polina.

37:20.671 --> 37:22.470
I was thinking maybe
we could have lunch together?

37:22.505 --> 37:23.933
I can't.
I have a lot of work to do.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.507
Okay, then, sorry.

37:32.548 --> 37:33.547
Good afternoon.

37:34.716 --> 37:36.451
- Hello.
-  So, what's going on
with my card?

37:36.783 --> 37:38.849
We are able to refund
the money to your card.

37:39.555 --> 37:41.720
Mm.
You can keep the dress.

37:43.460 --> 37:44.954
But your bride asked us--

37:44.989 --> 37:46.329
She's not my bride.

37:47.332 --> 37:48.463
I'll leave the money for her.

37:49.994 --> 37:51.631
- Can you give it to her?
-  Okay.

37:52.601 --> 37:53.765
This will be the refund.

37:54.339 --> 37:55.338
As you wish.

37:57.837 --> 37:58.869
Hello.

38:00.543 --> 38:01.575
How are you feeling?

38:01.940 --> 38:03.280
I'm fine, thank you.

38:04.074 --> 38:05.282
Can we talk?

38:08.584 --> 38:11.046
I thought you two
were so in love with each other.

38:12.456 --> 38:13.884
Sorry, I guess
it's none of my business.

38:14.557 --> 38:16.590
I thought so, too,
but I was wrong.

38:19.595 --> 38:21.056
Everyone makes mistakes.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.630
Yes and they should be
responsible for their mistakes.

38:30.507 --> 38:34.641
You know, I feel very guilty
for what I did to you.

38:36.876 --> 38:37.875
Um...

38:38.647 --> 38:40.009
- I was at the church and--
- Look,

38:40.979 --> 38:42.517
it doesn't really matter
anymore.

38:43.652 --> 38:44.651
Did you also make this?

38:46.556 --> 38:47.555
Yes.

38:48.591 --> 38:49.788
It's beautiful.

38:53.090 --> 38:55.464
I suppose you really love
what you do.

39:06.037 --> 39:07.905
-

39:15.717 --> 39:17.420
Zhenya, what's wrong?

39:17.620 --> 39:18.619
Where does it hurt?

39:36.034 --> 39:38.771
-

39:39.103 --> 39:40.002
Kirill, stop.

39:40.038 --> 39:41.807
- Who the hell are you?
-  Enough.

39:42.711 --> 39:43.941
I said stop!

39:52.017 --> 39:54.589
Stop, Kirill, calm down.

39:54.822 --> 39:55.654
He's a doctor.

39:56.021 --> 39:58.153
I felt sick and
he was taking me home.

40:01.532 --> 40:02.564
Are you done?

40:04.997 --> 40:05.996
Yes.

40:44.135 --> 40:46.773
I'm sorry,
I don't know what came over me.

40:47.875 --> 40:51.877
I saw you two together
and I just lost it.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.014
I need to go to my mom's
to pick up Polina.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.489
Let me take you there.

41:17.036 --> 41:18.508
Where are we going, Kirill?

41:18.939 --> 41:19.938
Can you hear me?

41:34.790 --> 41:35.855
Why are you bringing me here?

41:36.660 --> 41:38.594
And so I took you to my mom's.

41:38.827 --> 41:40.695
Are you kidding?
She hates me.

42:06.822 --> 42:07.621
Well...

42:10.023 --> 42:12.155
our relationship's been
tense lately.

42:17.294 --> 42:20.801
It's my fault, but we...

42:23.641 --> 42:24.673
we're working on it.

42:26.677 --> 42:28.303
We're learning from
our mistakes,

42:30.945 --> 42:35.079
but there's one mistake that
I'd like to correct right now.

42:35.246 --> 42:36.245
What's going on?

42:42.088 --> 42:43.087
Zhenya,

42:45.861 --> 42:48.565
I know you were expecting me
to do this sooner,

42:54.001 --> 42:55.836
but you're going to be my wife.

42:56.300 --> 42:57.332
Kirill.

43:00.678 --> 43:03.943
I...I need to think about it.

43:03.978 --> 43:05.846
She needs to think.

43:07.245 --> 43:09.377
She can do whatever she wants.

43:15.319 --> 43:17.319
Of course.

43:18.993 --> 43:20.960
I'm so stupid.
Mom, give me the ring.

43:20.995 --> 43:22.390
Kirill, enough with this farce.

43:22.425 --> 43:24.293
Nobody here
is interested in your opinion.

43:24.669 --> 43:26.669
Mom, give me the damn ring
right now!

43:27.199 --> 43:32.334
This damn ring, as you call it,
is an heirloom.

43:33.040 --> 43:35.645
This ring will be given
to someone who's worthy

43:35.680 --> 43:36.778
with my blessing.

44:39.073 --> 44:40.809
Run, Zhenya, run.

44:48.511 --> 44:50.115
Where are you going so fast?

44:51.085 --> 44:52.117
To see your daughter?

44:53.824 --> 44:54.823
She's fine.

44:59.423 --> 45:00.763
She's with my mom.

45:11.402 --> 45:12.434
Where is she?

45:17.012 --> 45:18.143
What did you do to her?

45:28.221 --> 45:29.825
It's just that you're mine

45:31.961 --> 45:32.960
and I'm yours.

45:33.996 --> 45:35.732
Remember?
Just like you wanted.

45:38.066 --> 45:40.231
No, this is not what I wanted.

45:41.168 --> 45:45.940
All I wanted was for you to
love me, but I made a mistake.

45:46.844 --> 45:48.206
What mistake, baby?

45:49.209 --> 45:50.241
I really do love you.

45:52.982 --> 45:54.509
No you don't, Kirill.

45:56.953 --> 45:57.985
I cast a spell.

45:58.548 --> 45:59.756
Hear me?

46:02.090 --> 46:04.926
I made you love me,
but I promise I'll fix this.

46:04.961 --> 46:07.126
Please,
just let us go now, Kirill.

46:14.905 --> 46:17.301
Shh, come here, silly thing.

46:20.141 --> 46:22.273
How could you
make someone love you?

46:26.048 --> 46:27.377
It's simple.

46:27.412 --> 46:29.016
I'm yours and you're mine,

46:31.152 --> 46:32.151
understand?

46:34.155 --> 46:39.092
-

46:59.213 --> 47:02.412
-

47:24.040 --> 47:27.041
-

47:52.530 --> 47:55.366
Baby, you're awake,

47:57.139 --> 47:58.974
but you can't get up just yet.

48:01.407 --> 48:02.406
Where are you?

48:03.640 --> 48:04.639
Yoo-hoo.

48:06.577 --> 48:09.050
We'll be together forever.

48:11.120 --> 48:12.119
Where are you?

48:13.386 --> 48:14.385
Baby.

48:17.258 --> 48:18.653
-

48:58.497 --> 49:00.365
The hell's the matter with you?

49:08.474 --> 49:10.078
- You break up with your man?
- Yes.

49:12.082 --> 49:13.180
I did.

49:15.448 --> 49:16.447
Men are bastards.

50:10.668 --> 50:12.140
What the hell are you doing?

50:47.144 --> 50:52.147
-

53:18.361 --> 53:19.426
Morning, Zhenya.

53:20.529 --> 53:21.956
I bought some diapers and
formula for your daughter.

53:23.828 --> 53:26.301
I hope I chose the right ones.

53:26.336 --> 53:27.929
Viktor, I feel so awkward.

53:28.965 --> 53:31.240
We showed up at your place
in the middle of the night.

53:31.275 --> 53:33.308
- You probably thought--
- No, Zhenya, I didn't.

53:35.444 --> 53:36.608
I'm glad you showed up.

53:39.712 --> 53:42.911
Here's the deal, you have
breakfast and get some rest.

53:43.485 --> 53:44.616
I'm saying this as a doctor.

53:45.719 --> 53:47.322
Then I'll come back and
we'll figure something out.

53:48.358 --> 53:49.819
- Deal?
- Deal.

53:50.921 --> 53:51.920
Great.

54:01.305 --> 54:02.403
Hello.

54:06.871 --> 54:08.772
Vit, I know
you'll never believe me,

54:10.380 --> 54:12.248
but can you please,
please hear me out?

54:18.388 --> 54:19.486
Vit.

54:19.521 --> 54:21.389
The lift's at capacity, Vik.

54:22.986 --> 54:24.557
Sorry, Sonya, no room.

54:27.056 --> 54:28.693
Vit, I won't leave
until we talk.

54:28.728 --> 54:29.727
Do you hear me?

54:31.467 --> 54:32.829
- Thanks, Kol.
- Hm.

54:33.766 --> 54:35.337
My ex is the same.

54:36.032 --> 54:37.999
Running around like a hyena.

54:41.741 --> 54:42.740
Who you have here?

54:44.106 --> 54:46.876
Motorcyclist with
a nasty head wound.

54:48.011 --> 54:51.452
Gotta do some
facial reconstruction
to not scare his family.

54:51.487 --> 54:53.916
-

55:13.509 --> 55:14.937
-

56:23.073 --> 56:25.447
-

56:54.643 --> 56:56.478
-

57:08.888 --> 57:12.791
-

57:15.257 --> 57:16.531
Zhenya, what's the matter?

57:28.677 --> 57:29.676
Kir was here.

57:30.679 --> 57:31.843
I don't know how he found us.

57:35.684 --> 57:37.079
Zhenya, Kirill's dead.

57:37.719 --> 57:39.719
-

57:50.765 --> 57:52.732
You ready?
- Yes.

58:26.064 --> 58:28.229
Can you please give us
one moment alone?

58:30.101 --> 58:31.100
Mm-hm.

58:43.312 --> 58:45.246
-

59:13.848 --> 59:14.847
Please forgive me.

59:18.380 --> 59:19.654
It's all my fault.

59:22.318 --> 59:24.054
I just couldn't let you go.

59:28.192 --> 59:29.895
-

59:35.100 --> 59:37.936
-

59:48.850 --> 59:50.586
-

1:00:30.826 --> 1:00:33.123
Listen, sometimes
when you're stressed out,

1:00:33.158 --> 1:00:34.795
your perception
can get distorted.

1:00:34.830 --> 1:00:36.632
It gets hard to see what's real
and what's not.

1:00:39.461 --> 1:00:40.900
I need to go now.

1:00:41.298 --> 1:00:42.737
Zhenya, but where?

1:00:42.772 --> 1:00:43.771
-

1:00:45.038 --> 1:00:46.037
It hurt?

1:00:47.172 --> 1:00:48.776
Okay, you need to stay here.

1:00:53.046 --> 1:00:54.045
Hey.

1:00:56.181 --> 1:00:57.917
I see you're here a lot, Zhenya.

1:00:58.183 --> 1:00:59.655
Some cute doctors, huh?

1:01:02.726 --> 1:01:04.187
And you don't look like
you're grieving much.

1:01:04.893 --> 1:01:07.058
Sonya, please, go home.

1:01:07.258 --> 1:01:08.422
Maybe better that she go?

1:01:09.260 --> 1:01:11.095
She's right. I have to go.

1:01:12.065 --> 1:01:13.064
Thanks for the help.

1:01:17.906 --> 1:01:18.971
Please forgive me.

1:01:22.372 --> 1:01:24.339
Just don't expect him
to marry you now.

1:01:24.814 --> 1:01:27.144
Marriage is something that
sticks with you, right, Vit?

1:01:28.884 --> 1:01:30.719
Her husband died today.

1:01:38.355 --> 1:01:40.828
Mom, how is Polina?

1:01:42.293 --> 1:01:43.457
Can I pick her up tomorrow?

1:01:43.998 --> 1:01:45.129
Yeah.

1:01:46.198 --> 1:01:47.934
Thanks, love you, too.

1:02:13.093 --> 1:02:15.159
I know this is going to
sound stupid,

1:02:17.328 --> 1:02:18.767
but I cast a spell.

1:02:20.199 --> 1:02:21.935
I wanted to bring Kirill back.

1:02:32.211 --> 1:02:34.376
You and Sonya seemed like
the perfect couple.

1:02:36.413 --> 1:02:38.248
Everything was
supposed to work out.

1:02:42.892 --> 1:02:45.024
But our feelings weren't true,
that's why it went wrong.

1:02:47.259 --> 1:02:48.764
It turned out to be a nightmare.

1:02:54.233 --> 1:02:57.234
Listen,
everything will be just fine.

1:03:03.880 --> 1:03:05.979
I summoned
a very strong demon.

1:03:06.542 --> 1:03:09.213
He feeds on pure love,
but he was tricked.

1:03:09.611 --> 1:03:11.919
You rewarded him
with rotten meat.

1:03:21.194 --> 1:03:23.062
You see?
Your love wasn't true.

1:03:25.231 --> 1:03:26.362
I want to fix this.

1:03:27.266 --> 1:03:28.397
There must be a way, right?

1:03:29.235 --> 1:03:31.466
Some mistakes
can only be fixed in death.

1:03:33.536 --> 1:03:35.404
Zhenya, she's messing around
with you.

1:03:36.539 --> 1:03:38.110
Coming was a mistake.

1:03:40.510 --> 1:03:45.018
I don't know how to fix this,
myself, but, you can ask.

1:03:46.120 --> 1:03:47.515
However, it's dangerous.

1:03:49.420 --> 1:03:50.452
What do I have to do?

1:03:51.290 --> 1:03:53.257
Not you, him.

1:03:54.524 --> 1:03:56.260
If he's here,
he'll bring the demon.

1:03:57.197 --> 1:03:58.834
Okay, enough.

1:04:00.662 --> 1:04:02.266
Everything she said is true.

1:04:05.304 --> 1:04:07.073
Are you always
like this, doctor?

1:04:07.603 --> 1:04:10.175
Doing only what's right
and not how you feel?

1:04:11.475 --> 1:04:13.178
Why did you marry that girl?

1:04:13.213 --> 1:04:14.443
You didn't want that, did you?

1:04:15.380 --> 1:04:17.050
Could it be
that you made a mistake?

1:04:18.317 --> 1:04:20.053
My mistake was coming here.

1:04:21.287 --> 1:04:22.583
Then why are you here?

1:04:23.553 --> 1:04:24.552
Think.

1:04:37.501 --> 1:04:38.973
Enter when the time comes.

1:04:51.383 --> 1:04:53.416
-

1:05:03.329 --> 1:05:04.559
Close your eyes.

1:05:06.629 --> 1:05:08.299
No sudden movements.

1:05:21.182 --> 1:05:23.314
-

1:06:41.196 --> 1:06:44.032
-

1:06:45.266 --> 1:06:47.002
Master are you here?

1:06:48.170 --> 1:06:50.665
I'm here, come.

1:06:59.445 --> 1:07:01.346
Why are you hunting this woman?

1:07:03.416 --> 1:07:04.646
She summoned me.

1:07:09.653 --> 1:07:11.158
What do you need from her?

1:07:12.788 --> 1:07:13.787
Her soul.

1:07:15.791 --> 1:07:17.329
She promised it to me.

1:07:20.466 --> 1:07:22.334
The first candle my soul.

1:07:26.109 --> 1:07:27.240
The second...

1:07:28.210 --> 1:07:29.209
hers.

1:07:30.839 --> 1:07:33.345
I take all I have been promised.

1:09:14.283 --> 1:09:15.678
You all belong to him now.

1:09:16.945 --> 1:09:18.879
It's only a matter of time.

1:09:20.685 --> 1:09:21.618
Do you understand what you did?

1:09:23.424 --> 1:09:26.260
You came to someone's wedding,
you ruined it.

1:09:29.826 --> 1:09:31.595
You killed a man, Zhenya.

1:09:33.764 --> 1:09:35.467
Kirill died because of you.

1:09:39.506 --> 1:09:43.673
I want to fix everything, but,
I need you, your help.

1:09:46.480 --> 1:09:47.809
I don't wanna be
involved in this.

1:09:49.648 --> 1:09:50.779
I'm sorry.

1:11:01.588 --> 1:11:02.884
Oleg, why are you here?

1:11:02.919 --> 1:11:03.918
Go away.

1:11:10.058 --> 1:11:11.959
Sonya, you don't love him.

1:11:12.863 --> 1:11:13.862
I can tell.

1:11:26.107 --> 1:11:27.843
- We need to talk.
- Oleg, please don't.

1:11:28.010 --> 1:11:29.581
- I love Sonya.
- Oleg, enough.

1:11:29.616 --> 1:11:30.615
This is nonsense.

1:11:30.782 --> 1:11:31.880
We'll discuss later.

1:11:33.455 --> 1:11:34.454
Give us a minute.

1:11:34.918 --> 1:11:35.917
Please.

1:11:44.994 --> 1:11:47.863
-

1:11:53.002 --> 1:11:54.936
You can't reverse the spell.

1:11:54.971 --> 1:11:57.004
Your marriage is blessed
by the Devil.

1:11:57.578 --> 1:11:59.611
Every participant
is now marked.

1:12:00.812 --> 1:12:02.515
My daughter is reckless.

1:12:02.781 --> 1:12:04.077
She has made many mistakes

1:12:04.112 --> 1:12:06.046
and owes the spirits
a great debt.

1:12:06.081 --> 1:12:08.686
She thought she could
pay them off with pure love,

1:12:09.788 --> 1:12:10.919
but she failed.

1:12:14.397 --> 1:12:17.431
Making pacts with the Devil
is a dangerous thing,

1:12:18.599 --> 1:12:20.896
but even he can be tricked.

1:12:22.130 --> 1:12:24.438
You know, I thought
that if we got married

1:12:25.738 --> 1:12:26.869
it would have been
the right thing.

1:12:28.005 --> 1:12:31.478
To settle down, have a family,
like it's usually done,

1:12:34.813 --> 1:12:36.945
but to be honest,
I never really loved you.

1:12:42.623 --> 1:12:44.018
You never loved me either.

1:12:46.660 --> 1:12:47.890
I mean really loved.

1:12:55.537 --> 1:12:56.602
I guess...

1:12:58.133 --> 1:13:00.375
we were caught
in this untrue love.

1:13:00.674 --> 1:13:01.904
Nothing could have helped us.

1:13:03.039 --> 1:13:04.071
Not the wedding,

1:13:07.549 --> 1:13:08.548
not a spell.

1:13:11.817 --> 1:13:13.454
If love wasn't true,

1:13:15.216 --> 1:13:16.853
then the deal can be called off.

1:13:19.220 --> 1:13:21.429
You'll have to gather everyone
who was at the wedding

1:13:21.893 --> 1:13:24.762
and perform the ceremony
in reverse order,

1:13:26.128 --> 1:13:29.129
but they all have to come
of their own free will.

1:13:30.572 --> 1:13:33.606
Otherwise, the demon won't
stop until he gets your soul.

1:13:42.650 --> 1:13:43.748
I won't help her.

1:13:43.783 --> 1:13:44.947
She ruined everything.

1:13:47.886 --> 1:13:49.556
In some way we're also guilty.

1:13:50.218 --> 1:13:53.989
I think it's the time
to fix it all, everything.

1:13:55.256 --> 1:13:56.695
You know what, you fix it.

1:13:59.931 --> 1:14:00.963
You do it.

1:14:04.903 --> 1:14:06.034
Thank you, Oleg.

1:14:11.712 --> 1:14:13.173
-

1:14:13.208 --> 1:14:14.944
- Sonya.
-

1:15:48.204 --> 1:15:49.808
-

1:16:22.271 --> 1:16:24.238
-

1:16:37.726 --> 1:16:38.725
You okay?

1:16:39.694 --> 1:16:42.993
There, everyone
who's involved has arrived.

1:17:12.288 --> 1:17:14.794
Has everyone come here
by their own free will?

1:17:15.192 --> 1:17:17.159
The ceremony
will be performed only

1:17:17.194 --> 1:17:19.392
with the consent
of every participant.

1:17:22.001 --> 1:17:24.100
The spirits don't like
to be tricked.

1:17:25.136 --> 1:17:27.400
The liar shall pay
for their mistake.

1:17:34.717 --> 1:17:36.783
-

1:17:56.233 --> 1:17:59.773
We are our own,
blood and blood.

1:17:59.808 --> 1:18:02.435
-

1:18:02.470 --> 1:18:06.340
The second candle,
release my soul.

1:18:06.375 --> 1:18:08.045
-

1:18:21.962 --> 1:18:25.964
The first candle,
release my soul.

1:18:27.132 --> 1:18:29.099
Wait, stop.

1:18:29.464 --> 1:18:31.871
-

1:19:10.208 --> 1:19:13.242
Polina, Polina, my sweet baby.

1:19:24.354 --> 1:19:25.485
Where is the girl?

1:19:52.019 --> 1:19:53.447
-

1:19:54.450 --> 1:19:56.956
-

1:21:01.924 --> 1:21:05.860
Polina,
Polina, where are you?

1:21:07.061 --> 1:21:11.030
Zhenya, what do we do?

1:21:11.461 --> 1:21:13.527
- Mom?
- Your daughter's missing.

1:21:27.543 --> 1:21:29.279
Come on, come on,
pick up the phone.

1:21:31.547 --> 1:21:32.546
She's not answering.

1:21:58.376 --> 1:21:59.375
They're not here.

1:22:03.183 --> 1:22:04.314
I know where they are.

1:22:42.453 --> 1:22:43.683
-

1:23:06.180 --> 1:23:07.212
Hold on.

1:23:22.526 --> 1:23:24.229
Mom, Mama.

1:23:28.532 --> 1:23:31.533
Mom, Mom, we're going to
get you out of here.

1:23:36.837 --> 1:23:38.441
I'll help her.
Go look for your daughter.

1:24:01.202 --> 1:24:02.465
Hold on.
It's going to hurt.

1:24:18.879 --> 1:24:22.089
-

1:24:48.876 --> 1:24:50.084
Mom?

1:26:20.902 --> 1:26:21.901
Stop it!

1:26:31.385 --> 1:26:32.384
I'll be with you.

1:26:35.389 --> 1:26:37.389
You are mine and I am yours.

1:26:38.425 --> 1:26:39.424
Take my soul.

1:27:16.023 --> 1:27:17.891
Everything's going to be okay.

1:27:55.766 --> 1:27:58.602
-

1:28:16.787 --> 1:28:19.722
-
