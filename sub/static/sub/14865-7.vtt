WEBVTT

01:52.571 --> 01:54.732
Brutus.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.738
Brutus.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.628
Domina. Domina, please don't do that.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.677
I'm so sorry.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.187
Why don't you lie down? You're very tired.

02:33.362 --> 02:34.568
Yes...

02:34.697 --> 02:36.528
I'm...

02:36.657 --> 02:39.034
very tired.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.651
Would you like some willow water?

02:43.914 --> 02:45.825
Would I?

02:45.958 --> 02:47.289
It will help you sleep.

02:48.377 --> 02:53.667
No. No more sleep.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.810
Oh, come along, cheer up.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.320
You can't cry at your own wedding.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.448
Show her how lovely she looks.

03:25.039 --> 03:28.406
— I look horrid.
— No, you're beautiful.

03:30.336 --> 03:33.373
Gods, still weeping.

03:33.506 --> 03:36.043
I went to a lot of trouble
to arrange this marriage.

03:36.175 --> 03:38.712
Please don't ruin it.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.177
There's not many men
willing to marry a penniless orphan.

03:42.306 --> 03:45.298
I'm sorry. I am very grateful.

03:46.519 --> 03:51.388
It's just... I'm sure he's a very nice man.

03:51.524 --> 03:53.685
It's just, I had always imagined

03:53.818 --> 03:56.810
l'd wed someone...

03:56.946 --> 03:58.527
Someone different.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.819
You won't wed anyone at all
if you come out all red and puffy.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.079
I know men.

04:12.211 --> 04:17.001
And this one will make a lovely husband.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.728
When and where you are Gaia,

04:32.857 --> 04:36.224
there and then I am Gaius.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.694
Yes, sorry.

04:40.823 --> 04:43.986
When and where you are Gaius,

04:44.118 --> 04:47.201
then and there, I am Gaia.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.042
Makes you think, doesn't it?

05:03.179 --> 05:06.296
- About what?
— About marriage.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.885
— Does it?
— The two of us.

05:13.606 --> 05:15.972
With the augur here,
we might as well do it now.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.723
Quick and simple.

05:18.903 --> 05:22.566
When we get married,
lt'll have to be the best wedding ever seen.

05:22.698 --> 05:25.064
You deserve nothing less.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.947
Just a thought.

05:32.041 --> 05:35.158
This augur moves like a snail.

05:35.294 --> 05:37.250
Atia of the Julii,

05:37.379 --> 05:39.961
I call for justice!

05:40.090 --> 05:42.376
Atia of the Julii,

05:42.510 --> 05:44.626
I call for justice.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.299
Atia of the Julii,

05:47.431 --> 05:50.138
I call for justice.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.474
EXCUSE me for a moment.

05:52.603 --> 05:55.185
Atia of the Julii,

05:55.314 --> 05:58.056
I call for justice.

05:58.192 --> 06:00.478
Atia of the Julii,

06:00.611 --> 06:03.478
I call for justice.

06:03.614 --> 06:06.105
Atia of the Julii,

06:06.242 --> 06:08.824
I call for justice.

06:08.953 --> 06:11.319
Atia of the Julii,

06:11.455 --> 06:14.663
I call for justice.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.249
Atia of the Julii,

06:17.378 --> 06:19.710
I call for justice.

06:19.838 --> 06:23.672
— Atia of the Julii, I call forjustice.
- Ludicrous old bat.

06:23.801 --> 06:28.761
— What shall we do?
— Atia of the Julii, I call forjustice.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.471
Nothing. Nothing at all.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.467
She'll go away soon enough
if we just ignore her.

06:41.110 --> 06:43.351
Hey, wife.

06:45.364 --> 06:47.696
Sun's been up for hours.

06:47.825 --> 06:50.362
It's time to get up.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.995
Soon.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.368
While we're here...

06:57.501 --> 06:59.037
No.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.706
You don't know what I was gonna ask.

07:01.839 --> 07:04.171
You want to make love.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.503
That's an idea.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.546
No good for baby.

07:08.679 --> 07:10.590
He won't mind.

07:10.723 --> 07:12.679
Maybe she.

07:12.808 --> 07:16.050
She won't mind, neither.

07:16.186 --> 07:20.054
No good for baby. Priest says so.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.727
Priest? Priest?

07:22.860 --> 07:25.067
What priest?

07:25.195 --> 07:27.186
Priest in my country.

07:29.241 --> 07:32.324
Well, we're not in your country, are we?

07:32.453 --> 07:35.695
When baby start to move, no love.

07:35.831 --> 07:37.617
ls rules.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.245
The baby's moving?

07:40.377 --> 07:43.369
Yes, feel.

07:57.436 --> 08:00.769
So we have no choice
but to use the deeper berths in Ostia.

08:00.898 --> 08:04.607
We now have grain ships
in excess of 10,000 amphorae.

08:05.986 --> 08:10.275
Tricky. Those berths have been
reserved for our oil ships

08:10.407 --> 08:12.739
since fuck knows when, way back.

08:12.868 --> 08:14.824
Well, that's no reason to keep it so.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.158
- Times change.
— So you keep saying.

08:20.751 --> 08:23.037
l'll allow you to use our berths,

08:23.170 --> 08:24.785
but we'll take 5% of the grain

08:24.922 --> 08:27.709
and the ships will be unloaded by my own men.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.254
Bollocks. That's a license for thievery.

08:31.387 --> 08:33.469
If we were thieves.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.969
I'll give you the 5%, but Mascius
will go down to Ostia

08:38.102 --> 08:40.639
and he will supervise the dock work.

08:40.771 --> 08:43.262
I'll leave today.

08:43.399 --> 08:45.606
As you wish.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.426
Atia of the Julii,

09:22.563 --> 09:24.053
I call for justice.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.690
Atia of the Julii,

09:25.816 --> 09:27.226
I call for justice.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.350
Atia of the Julii,

09:29.486 --> 09:31.351
I call for justice.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.399
Atia of the Julii,

09:33.532 --> 09:34.863
I call for justice.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.857
Atia of the Julii,

09:36.994 --> 09:38.404
I call for justice.

09:38.537 --> 09:40.402
Atia of the Julii,

09:40.539 --> 09:41.904
I call for justice.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.035
Good morning, all.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.159
You're late.

09:48.756 --> 09:50.712
Posca's wedding yesterday.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.585
I'm afraid I drank rather too much.

09:55.721 --> 09:59.589
I could not get out of bed,
no matter how hard I tried.

10:00.559 --> 10:04.393
l have the most shocking headache.

10:04.521 --> 10:07.433
So you must both speak very quietly

10:07.566 --> 10:10.933
or I shall shatter into a thousand little pieces.

10:20.037 --> 10:24.030
I've been approached by a number
of eminent friends among the Senate.

10:25.501 --> 10:27.617
They are troubled.

10:27.753 --> 10:31.245
I do not say that they have grounds for anxiety,

10:31.381 --> 10:34.214
but I feel I would be remiss
if I did not communicate...

10:34.343 --> 10:37.255
— Do get on with it, man.
- Yes, yes.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.808
They're worried that perhaps we three intend

10:42.851 --> 10:44.933
to establish some form of...

10:45.062 --> 10:46.598
tyranny.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.847
And who are these worriers?

10:49.983 --> 10:52.235
— Give me names.
- That's awkward.

10:52.361 --> 10:55.023
They spoke to me in confidence.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.362
I'll bet they did.

10:57.491 --> 11:02.235
You tell your eminent friends
to shut their mouths.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.955
Tell them to go look
on Cicero's hands in the Forum

11:06.083 --> 11:08.165
and remember what happens

11:08.293 --> 11:11.660
to those that prattle of tyranny.

11:11.797 --> 11:14.789
| only mention it.
I would be remiss if I did not.

11:14.925 --> 11:16.790
You're quite right, Lepidus.

11:16.927 --> 11:18.838
Quite right.

11:18.971 --> 11:21.007
Now, shall we get down to business?

11:21.139 --> 11:23.516
Yes, by all means.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.349
Clearly, we three cannot
all rule together at once.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.594
We shall confuse and contradict each other.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.642
- True enough.
— We must divide responsibilities.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.104
What are you proposing?

11:35.237 --> 11:38.024
| suggest we divide
the territory of Rome into three.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.772
Each one of us shall assume
command of one region.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.580
Sounds reasonable.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.372
Who gets what?

11:52.504 --> 11:54.415
I haven't considered that yet.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.459
But Rome is a very complex machine.

11:56.592 --> 11:59.925
One can't simply chop it up like cabbage.

12:12.524 --> 12:16.642
You should have Rome and the west.

12:17.696 --> 12:24.408
And I will make do with
Egypt and the eastern provinces.

12:27.789 --> 12:31.327
— Objections?
— Rome and the west has what?

12:31.460 --> 12:35.373
Rowdy Gauls, Germans, a fractious Senate,

12:35.505 --> 12:38.668
all the trouble of keeping
the Roman mob happy.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.258
The east is where the money is,

12:42.387 --> 12:45.379
the grain supply, most of the tax revenue.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.349
Well, all the revenues
would be divided equally, of course.

12:49.478 --> 12:51.935
It would be a purely administrative division.

12:52.064 --> 12:56.182
All monies would be held in a single treasury.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.523
— That would work.
- And I?

13:02.324 --> 13:03.985
What would I get?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.527
Yes.

13:16.338 --> 13:18.203
Africa.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.679
Atia of the Julii,

13:24.805 --> 13:27.262
I call for justice.

13:27.391 --> 13:29.598
Atia of the Julii,

13:29.726 --> 13:32.433
I call for justice.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.974
Atia of the Julii,

13:35.107 --> 13:37.439
I call for justice.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.944
Atia of the Julii...

13:40.070 --> 13:42.607
What is this? Is she putting down roots?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.695
Atia of the Julii,

13:44.825 --> 13:47.658
I call for justice.

13:47.786 --> 13:50.368
Atia of the Julii,

13:50.497 --> 13:52.658
I call for justice.

13:52.791 --> 13:54.372
Atia of the Julii...

13:54.501 --> 13:56.787
So...

13:56.920 --> 13:59.582
How goes your day?

13:59.715 --> 14:01.626
Mine went extremely well.

14:01.758 --> 14:04.591
She's driving me mad. It's completely unfair.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.676
It wasn't me who killed her precious son.

14:06.805 --> 14:11.595
— She should be wailing outside your house.
- She just wants a little attention.

14:11.727 --> 14:15.265
Go out. Let her rant at you a while.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.683
She'll soon leave.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.808
And have her curse at me
in front of a mob of ogling plebs?

14:20.944 --> 14:23.856
Never. I wouldn't give her that pleasure.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.399
It's up to you.

14:25.532 --> 14:29.366
But I guarantee
she won't leave until she's seen you.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.611
Atia of the Julii...

14:34.916 --> 14:36.952
Stop pushing!

14:38.086 --> 14:40.418
Wait your turn, woman!

14:40.547 --> 14:42.287
My family is begging for food!

14:46.803 --> 14:48.509
Seen you on line before.

14:48.638 --> 14:50.594
Me? No.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.341
This looks like a fake to me.

14:54.478 --> 14:56.389
I bet you don't even live on the Aventine.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.978
No fake. lswear
to you by the sacred black stone.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.224
Get out and don't let me
catch you around here again.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.644
Get off!

15:20.378 --> 15:22.369
Did you bring in wood?

15:23.215 --> 15:26.673
— Not yet.
— Go do.

15:26.802 --> 15:29.669
— No hurry.
— Get wood now.

15:29.805 --> 15:33.343
Get it yourself. I'm busy.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.217
I give you an order.

15:36.353 --> 15:38.184
Kiss my ass.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.525
l'll shove it down your throat.

15:46.655 --> 15:48.065
You'll be sorry.

15:50.283 --> 15:53.070
My husband will beat you in pulp.

15:56.289 --> 15:58.280
Go on, on your way.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.160
Fake.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.914
Half the people in the line had them.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.756
Well made.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.467
— Memmio, I expect.
- Very likely.

16:14.599 --> 16:18.091
— What do we do?
— Nothing.

16:19.688 --> 16:22.020
Lost me there.

16:22.149 --> 16:24.060
Memmio is dishonest and greedy.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.103
Nothing we can do can change that.

16:26.236 --> 16:29.103
If he thinks he's deceiving us, then he's happy.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.025
And I want everyone to be happy.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.365
That's how we keep the peace. We do nothing.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.108
But he's stealing from us.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.452
People who need food are getting fed.

16:37.581 --> 16:40.323
What matter where they live exactly?

16:42.586 --> 16:44.292
You must go to beat her dead!

16:44.421 --> 16:47.254
— Calm down. Beat who?
- That whore, that Gaia.

16:47.382 --> 16:50.089
— You beat her dead!
— What's she done now?

16:50.218 --> 16:54.587
She wouldn't bring in wood like I tell her.
Then she say she'll choke me with a stick.

16:54.723 --> 16:58.557
- What?
— She say she's gonna choke me with a stick.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.973
I don't understand. Why would she do that?
What did you do to her?

17:02.105 --> 17:03.845
Perfect. Now it's my fault?

17:03.982 --> 17:06.894
— Thank you. Thank you very much.
— Eirene.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.151
Oh, cack.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.236
What do I do?

17:12.365 --> 17:14.981
— Don't look at me.
- Very funny.

17:15.118 --> 17:18.781
If I go and beat Gaia like she deserves,
what do you think Mascius will do?

17:18.914 --> 17:21.997
— She's his girl.
— It's a puzzle, all right.

17:22.125 --> 17:25.913
Where's Mascius? Maybe if I go and talk
to him man to man, he can chastise her.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.162
He's in Ostia. The new grain—ship business.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.663
Oh, cack.

17:31.384 --> 17:34.376
Maybe if you were to give her the beating...

17:35.639 --> 17:37.550
I will if you want.

17:39.476 --> 17:43.936
No. It's my wife she insulted,
my responsibility.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.651
Marriage, it's complicated.

17:49.694 --> 17:53.687
With her pregnant now...
I think it drives them a little mad.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.232
Here's to a boy.

17:57.369 --> 17:59.280
A boy.

18:08.922 --> 18:10.753
Chief.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.092
What's that for?

18:16.638 --> 18:18.924
Don't make a fuss now.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.350
What? You're gonna whip me?

18:23.478 --> 18:24.763
lam.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.891
Why would you want to do that?

18:28.024 --> 18:30.060
You know damn well why.

18:31.611 --> 18:35.945
— Tell me.
— You disrespected my wife.

18:37.075 --> 18:39.532
Oh, that. She tried to hit me.

18:40.203 --> 18:43.491
She's lady of this house. You're a slave!
She's allowed to hit you.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.738
Now let's get it done.

18:44.874 --> 18:47.661
It's hard to remember
she's married to the boss.

18:47.794 --> 18:51.252
I mean, nothing against her.
It's just not natural.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.588
She's such a mouse of a woman.

18:53.717 --> 18:55.673
You're such a lion of a man.

18:55.802 --> 18:59.010
Gerrae. You know nothing of us.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.800
Mouse.

19:02.100 --> 19:05.217
Lion. Anyone can see.

19:09.399 --> 19:11.481
What sort of animal does that make you?

19:11.609 --> 19:14.351
What kind of animal do you want me to be?

19:15.405 --> 19:19.398
The kind that will bend over
and take her whipping without complaint.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.359
I could do that for you.

19:25.373 --> 19:28.080
But you've got to treat me nice first.

19:28.209 --> 19:31.417
Just shut it, all right?
Just shut it and come here.

19:31.546 --> 19:33.457
What will Mascius do if you beat me?

19:33.590 --> 19:36.707
I don't give a fuck.
Mascius will do what I tell him.

19:36.843 --> 19:39.710
No, Mascius does what I tell him.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.052
Oh, yeah?

19:42.474 --> 19:43.884
More fool him, then.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.849
Fuck you!

19:55.111 --> 19:57.102
What are you gonna do now?

21:01.886 --> 21:04.002
Is that all you got?

21:33.835 --> 21:35.791
This was a mistake.

21:37.547 --> 21:39.629
This never happens again.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.549
Shame.

21:43.678 --> 21:46.465
You and me go nicely together,
don't you think?

21:46.598 --> 21:49.931
You and me are nothing.

21:50.059 --> 21:52.926
But what if I misbehave again?

21:53.062 --> 21:55.724
You gotta keep me disciplined, haven't you?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.773
Don't test me, girl.

21:59.903 --> 22:02.110
l'm warning you.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.945
You'll be sorry.

22:05.074 --> 22:06.814
Relax.

22:08.244 --> 22:13.034
Where's it say a man can't have his slaves
if he wants?

22:16.419 --> 22:18.910
I can kill them too,

22:19.047 --> 22:21.163
if I want.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.425
You can.

22:25.553 --> 22:28.260
You can do anything you like.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.823
Atia of the Julii,

22:48.952 --> 22:51.318
I call for justice.

22:51.454 --> 22:53.991
Atia of the Julii,

22:54.123 --> 22:56.535
I call for justice.

22:56.668 --> 22:59.330
Atia of the Julii,

22:59.462 --> 23:02.829
I call for justice...

23:02.966 --> 23:06.379
I give up. I give up! I give up!

23:06.511 --> 23:08.672
Atia of the Julii,

23:08.805 --> 23:11.137
I call for justice.

23:11.266 --> 23:12.927
Atia of the Julii,

23:13.059 --> 23:15.641
I call for justice.

23:15.770 --> 23:17.931
Atia of the Julii

23:18.064 --> 23:19.770
— I call forjustice.
- Here, then!

23:24.404 --> 23:26.520
Here I am, you crazy bitch!

23:26.656 --> 23:30.444
Speak your piece and then be gone.
Here I am!

23:40.503 --> 23:42.664
Gods below...

23:46.175 --> 23:49.542
I am Servilia

23:49.679 --> 23:51.715
of the most ancient

23:51.848 --> 23:54.134
and sacred Junii,

23:54.267 --> 24:00.183
of whose bones the seven hills
of Rome are built.

24:01.357 --> 24:04.269
l summon you to listen.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.901
Curse this woman.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.193
Send her bitterness and despair

24:15.330 --> 24:18.072
for all of her life.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.619
Let her taste nothing

24:20.752 --> 24:24.040
but ashes and iron.

24:25.256 --> 24:28.419
Gods of the UndenNorld,

24:28.551 --> 24:31.042
all that l have left

24:31.179 --> 24:34.137
I give to you in sacrifice

24:34.265 --> 24:36.756
if you will make it so.

24:42.940 --> 24:44.726
My God.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.258
Now that is an exit.

25:29.487 --> 25:32.274
Come. Come back inside.

25:40.707 --> 25:42.413
She's dead.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.884
All citizens be aware

26:03.020 --> 26:05.432
that the vassal Prince Herod,

26:05.565 --> 26:07.180
Tetrarch of Galilee,

26:07.316 --> 26:09.022
has come to the city.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.313
By order of the Triumvirate,

26:11.446 --> 26:13.232
during his residence here,

26:13.364 --> 26:18.028
all mockery of Jews and their one God

26:18.161 --> 26:22.074
shall be kept to an appropriate minimum.

26:26.210 --> 26:31.625
I am told
Roman gentlemen do not solicit bribes.

26:32.216 --> 26:36.710
One must offer the bribe as a gift.
Is that so?

26:36.846 --> 26:38.802
Yes.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.887
Yes, that is so.

26:42.852 --> 26:46.811
We are the most dreadful
hypocrites, I'm afraid.

26:48.608 --> 26:51.395
I offer you a gift, then.

26:51.527 --> 26:53.779
Help me take the throne of Judea,

26:53.905 --> 26:58.569
make my enemies your enemies,
and I offer you a substantial gift.

27:02.371 --> 27:05.238
How substantial would this gift be?

27:05.374 --> 27:07.581
How substantial does it need to be?

27:07.710 --> 27:09.416
20,000 pounds of gold.

27:09.545 --> 27:11.536
Done.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.043
I said we should have asked for more.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.251
You must guarantee, of course,

27:18.387 --> 27:20.719
to keep your Jews in line.

27:21.849 --> 27:26.218
They will do as I say,
or they will suffer the consequences.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.266
Congratulations then, Herod.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.650
You have the full backing of Rome.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.603
One question.

27:33.736 --> 27:37.274
— Yes.
— Our friends, Octavian and Lepidus.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.862
You speak for them too?

27:39.909 --> 27:43.242
I do. We speak with one voice.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.698
So they will not come to me later
expecting gifts of their own?

27:47.834 --> 27:53.079
— No, your gift is for all of us.
— Good.

27:53.923 --> 27:58.587
Wonderful to have such trust
between friends.

28:09.272 --> 28:12.105
That is what I call a good morning's work.

28:13.276 --> 28:16.063
lndeed. A good morning's work.

28:16.195 --> 28:20.188
May | inquire what my share will be?

28:20.324 --> 28:22.610
Share? Share of what?

28:23.369 --> 28:25.155
Of Herod's gift.

28:25.288 --> 28:28.576
— What gift?
- | see.

28:28.708 --> 28:30.994
Do you?

28:31.127 --> 28:33.539
Let me be clear.

28:33.671 --> 28:35.582
There was no gift.

28:35.715 --> 28:40.129
Herod came here today
to discuss administrative issues

28:40.261 --> 28:42.547
of taxes on olive groves,

28:42.680 --> 28:46.218
of border defences against the Parthians.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.262
— There was no gift.
- I understand.

28:50.646 --> 28:52.762
Really, Posca,

28:52.899 --> 28:55.561
ever since you got your freedom,

28:55.693 --> 28:58.526
you have become insufferably greedy.

28:58.654 --> 29:02.021
Go home, have a good lunch,

29:02.158 --> 29:05.366
make love to your pretty young wife,

29:05.494 --> 29:09.533
but do stop grubbing about
after other people's money.

29:10.333 --> 29:14.326
Trust me, you'll be far more content.

29:26.891 --> 29:29.257
Scum.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.725
Bastard scum!

29:31.854 --> 29:34.345
What good is shouting at him on the street?

29:34.482 --> 29:36.848
lt's childish. You'll only get into trouble.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.020
He's worse than his father.

29:39.153 --> 29:42.065
He'll make our people slaves and idolaters.

29:42.198 --> 29:44.314
He should die. The bastard should die!

29:44.909 --> 29:47.616
Well, it would be a mitzvah, no doubt.

29:49.956 --> 29:52.572
Come on. Us?

29:52.708 --> 29:55.541
If not us, then who?

29:55.670 --> 29:58.628
Herod is here. We are here.

29:58.756 --> 30:02.419
The future of our people is in our hands.

30:28.995 --> 30:31.281
Salve, Maecenas.

30:31.414 --> 30:33.370
Hello, Posca.

30:38.254 --> 30:40.870
Might I have a word?

30:42.675 --> 30:45.883
I suppose, if you must.

30:47.263 --> 30:50.505
It strikes me you're the sort of man

30:50.641 --> 30:53.724
that knows how to keep a confidence.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.844
Yes.

30:57.606 --> 31:02.646
If a man were to tell you something
in confidence,

31:02.778 --> 31:07.442
you might tell others,
but you would not reveal your source.

31:09.910 --> 31:11.946
No.

31:19.295 --> 31:24.289
And perhaps you're the sort of man
that knows how to properly...

31:25.426 --> 31:27.417
reward...

31:27.553 --> 31:30.340
those who confide in him.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.680
You have me exactly.

31:32.808 --> 31:35.060
You're a fine judge of character.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.136
Those lions you bought me were useless.

31:39.273 --> 31:43.391
Wouldn't pull my chariot for shit
and bit the arm off a perfectly good groom.

31:43.527 --> 31:45.984
They are temperamental animals.

31:46.113 --> 31:48.855
I am very fortunate to have a giraffe,

31:48.991 --> 31:50.572
should you be interested.

31:50.701 --> 31:54.114
What would I do with a giraffe?

31:54.246 --> 31:56.498
Camels, perhaps?

31:56.624 --> 31:59.991
Camels? Do I look
like a fucking date merchant?

32:00.127 --> 32:02.994
Lions that run!

32:03.881 --> 32:05.872
Get out.

32:07.510 --> 32:11.469
Now, what news, young Caesar?

32:11.597 --> 32:14.680
What is one—third of 20,000?

32:15.601 --> 32:19.264
6,666 or thereabouts.

32:19.396 --> 32:21.387
Do you take me for a fool?

32:21.524 --> 32:24.391
Question after question.

32:24.527 --> 32:27.234
Makes for very poor conversation.

32:27.363 --> 32:30.355
If you have a grievance, just say what it is.

32:30.491 --> 32:32.277
We had an agreement.

32:32.409 --> 32:35.993
— We would share all revenue.
- Yes.

32:36.122 --> 32:40.786
Herod has agreed to give you
20,000 pounds of gold.

32:40.918 --> 32:42.909
I want my share.

32:43.671 --> 32:45.582
Who told you this?

32:45.714 --> 32:47.705
You deny?

32:50.136 --> 32:53.219
— Who told him?
— I've bought one of Herod's people.

32:54.932 --> 32:56.888
Do you deny it?

32:57.017 --> 33:00.430
lf Herod is kind enough to give me a gift,

33:00.563 --> 33:02.474
what business is it of yours?

33:02.606 --> 33:04.471
A gift is not revenue.

33:04.608 --> 33:08.476
It is not a gift. It is a bribe
for political and military favours,

33:08.612 --> 33:11.729
the cost of which favours
shall be borne by the state.

33:11.866 --> 33:14.983
— Pedantry.
— Let us be realistic.

33:15.119 --> 33:17.701
This arrangement of ours cannot work

33:17.830 --> 33:19.695
if you seek every opportunity

33:19.832 --> 33:22.494
to aggrandise yourself at my expense.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.912
Aggrandise myself?

33:29.967 --> 33:33.585
This from the boy who...
whose so—called father

33:33.721 --> 33:36.007
has been declared a god.

33:37.224 --> 33:39.089
An honour he well deserves.

33:39.226 --> 33:43.970
You only did it so that you might be known
as the son of a god.

33:44.106 --> 33:45.971
You have no accomplishments of your own,

33:46.108 --> 33:50.272
so you seek to borrow the glory of others.

33:50.404 --> 33:54.943
It's true. It was no accomplishment
to defeat you at Mutina.

33:55.075 --> 33:57.566
You defeated me?

33:59.788 --> 34:02.621
You cowardly little shit!

34:02.750 --> 34:04.991
He'd never even left his tent.

34:05.127 --> 34:09.416
You have never defeated me in anything.

34:09.548 --> 34:12.665
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
let's not get overheated.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.793
I'm sure we can come to some
kind of reasonable agreement.

34:15.930 --> 34:19.843
I had hoped you might have learned
some humility and discipline.

34:19.975 --> 34:25.936
| see now that you are still
the same crude, arrogant lech

34:26.065 --> 34:28.021
you always were.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.892
That's right, just the same.

34:31.028 --> 34:34.191
And still fucking your mother!

34:45.709 --> 34:47.540
Are you all right?

34:47.670 --> 34:49.535
Yes, nothing.

34:49.672 --> 34:52.163
— Do you want to go lie down?
- No, it's fine.

34:55.511 --> 34:57.422
Anything else, Mistress?

34:57.554 --> 34:59.545
Water.

35:07.898 --> 35:10.184
Master?

35:10.317 --> 35:12.308
No. Nothing.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.571
See? Good slave now,

35:21.704 --> 35:24.446
ever since you gave her a good beating.

35:26.208 --> 35:27.869
There you go.

35:30.296 --> 35:33.129
You should beat her
the same way every month.

35:45.894 --> 35:50.763
If she wakes before I'm back,
tell her I've gone to Lyde's temple.

36:07.624 --> 36:11.958
Tell me again about the farm.
What kind of animals will we have?

36:12.087 --> 36:14.954
Sheep,

36:15.090 --> 36:17.126
goats,

36:17.259 --> 36:19.170
— pigs.
— And chickens?

36:19.303 --> 36:22.795
Yes, horses as well. Elephants, if you like.

36:22.931 --> 36:25.468
— Sons of Dis, will you...
- What's the matter?

36:25.601 --> 36:28.764
I'm sorry. It's not you, it's...

36:28.896 --> 36:31.433
lt's business matters...

36:31.565 --> 36:33.430
Forget it.

36:33.567 --> 36:35.808
Give me a kiss.

36:35.944 --> 36:37.775
Do you still love me?

36:37.905 --> 36:40.817
Of course.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.905
Very much.

36:53.045 --> 36:54.910
Omnipor, I've been looking...

36:55.047 --> 36:58.255
Oh, excuse me.

37:01.845 --> 37:03.710
— Is that...
— lt's nobody.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.883
It's just a girl. I'll see you outside.

37:07.309 --> 37:10.642
— That's the daughter of Lucius Vorenus.
— No, it's not.

37:10.771 --> 37:13.808
Don't fuck me about.
I've got eyes, haven't I?

37:13.941 --> 37:16.148
How long's this been going on?

37:16.276 --> 37:17.652
A few months.

37:19.238 --> 37:22.526
Are you insane? You know
what disrespect this shows your father?

37:22.658 --> 37:26.822
- I don't care. I hate him.
— But think what will happen if he finds out.

37:26.954 --> 37:30.993
If I smile at him and serve his damn soup
like a good daughter, he thinks it's fine.

37:31.125 --> 37:33.491
— He won't find out.
— Will he not?

37:33.627 --> 37:38.212
Him and me are friends by oath. It is my duty
to be honest with him. I'll have to tell him.

37:38.340 --> 37:41.707
— You can't. You can't tell him!
— Sorry, love, but if I don't tell him

37:41.844 --> 37:43.755
I'm just as guilty as you two, aren't I?

37:43.887 --> 37:46.970
And what if he finds out?
He'll never believe I didn't know.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.806
His precious daughter and one of my men.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.017
He'll have my guts!

37:52.146 --> 37:54.137
This is a right fucking mess.

37:54.273 --> 37:56.810
Please, sir, don't tell him.

37:56.942 --> 37:58.773
He'll kill her.

37:58.902 --> 38:01.109
No, he won't go that far, I shouldn't think.

38:01.238 --> 38:02.899
Yes, he will. You know him.

38:03.031 --> 38:05.693
He's an animal.
He killed my mother. He'll kill me.

38:05.826 --> 38:10.490
But what am | to do?
You've put me in an impossible position here.

38:10.622 --> 38:13.659
I'll do anything you say.
Just please don't tell him.

38:17.713 --> 38:20.079
I don't know.

38:20.215 --> 38:22.797
Maybe.

38:24.219 --> 38:25.880
Maybe I can help you out.

38:26.889 --> 38:29.005
Thank you.

38:30.851 --> 38:33.593
Would you do something for me in return?

38:34.897 --> 38:37.263
Anything.

38:37.858 --> 38:41.021
Me and him do a lot of business together.

38:41.153 --> 38:44.691
If you kept your ears and eyes open,

38:44.823 --> 38:46.654
told me what was going on,

38:46.783 --> 38:48.819
that would be very helpful to me.

38:48.952 --> 38:50.783
I can do that.

38:50.913 --> 38:52.904
Good girl.

38:54.500 --> 38:55.990
lt's settled, then.

38:56.126 --> 39:01.462
— Herod's gift will be shared three ways.
— Minus a finder's commission.

39:01.590 --> 39:05.754
Each of you will consult the other
before naming any officials above aedile rank.

39:05.886 --> 39:11.006
The same goes for the appointment of
foreign chieftains, princes, kings and so forth.

39:11.141 --> 39:13.132
Now, all monies received,

39:13.268 --> 39:15.975
including taxes,
customs revenue, military spoils

39:16.104 --> 39:18.595
and informal gifts and bribes,

39:18.732 --> 39:20.814
will be placed in the treasury

39:20.943 --> 39:23.525
under the supervision of a Saturnine priest.

39:23.654 --> 39:25.861
Fine.

39:25.989 --> 39:28.731
And now you must shake hands.

39:33.372 --> 39:35.203
Lovely. Friends again.

39:35.332 --> 39:36.697
That wasn't so hard, was it?

39:36.833 --> 39:39.085
No. If we're all done, I have work to do.

39:39.211 --> 39:42.703
You do realise your two bickering
has put the whole city in a panic?

39:42.839 --> 39:45.330
I'll have the newsreader say something,

39:45.467 --> 39:47.753
"Renewed vows of amity" and so forth.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.377
No one believes what the newsreader says.

39:51.640 --> 39:54.052
You have some notion you wish to suggest?

39:54.851 --> 39:56.557
I do.

39:58.272 --> 40:02.231
If a marriage was to happen
between our two houses,

40:02.359 --> 40:04.475
no one could doubt all was well.

40:04.611 --> 40:07.728
Well, I don't care if all ltaly burns,

40:07.864 --> 40:10.321
I'll not marry him.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.991
It's not a bad idea.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.446
It would be a strong expression of unity.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.666
And the plebs love a good wedding.

40:24.840 --> 40:27.456
l have no objection.

40:27.593 --> 40:30.551
Thank you. I should think not.

40:31.179 --> 40:33.511
We should discuss it, at least.

40:34.474 --> 40:37.511
We could do it after Lupercalia.
It's very auspicious.

40:45.861 --> 40:47.726
What?

40:47.863 --> 40:53.233
If we are to discuss a marriage contract,
it's inappropriate for a woman to be present.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.986
Yes, sorry. Carry on.

40:57.122 --> 41:01.866
Be sure to leave enough time for
my dressmaker to make me something nice.

41:02.002 --> 41:04.038
Yes, Mother.

41:05.672 --> 41:07.503
I'm getting married.

41:07.633 --> 41:09.498
Antony and l are getting married.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.000
Where's Octavia?

41:35.410 --> 41:38.072
This wedding of Antony's tomorrow...

41:38.205 --> 41:40.491
I've just heard the dog Herod will be there.

41:40.624 --> 41:45.288
Him and a thousand other aristos.
There'll be lictors all over, soldiers as well.

41:45.420 --> 41:49.288
Watching the bride and groom,
nobody will be paying any mind to Herod.

41:49.424 --> 41:51.961
There'll be a big crowd, lots of noise.

41:52.094 --> 41:55.052
Chaos. It's the perfect time.

41:56.014 --> 41:57.754
I don't know.

41:58.892 --> 42:01.725
You're not losing your nerve, are you?

42:01.853 --> 42:04.686
— No.
— We made an oath on the Torah.

42:04.815 --> 42:07.147
And I'll not break it. I'm just saying,

42:07.275 --> 42:09.732
we've got to be sure,
we only get the one chance.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.852
This is it!

42:14.741 --> 42:16.117
Who knows?

42:16.243 --> 42:19.861
If we're lucky and the crowd's thick,
we might even make it out alive.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.863
No. There's no chance of that.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.786
We'll be hacked to pieces quick as Pan.

42:26.795 --> 42:29.457
His will be done.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.420
Tomorrow, then.

42:36.555 --> 42:38.420
Come, children.

42:44.312 --> 42:46.303
Yesh.

43:12.507 --> 43:15.249
— What are you doing?
- You scared me.

43:15.385 --> 43:18.001
l was looking for you, but you weren't here.

43:19.431 --> 43:21.387
Here I am.

43:24.352 --> 43:27.094
Are you all right? You look feverish.

43:27.230 --> 43:29.141
No, no, I'm good.

43:30.525 --> 43:32.140
Now, what do you need?

43:33.028 --> 43:34.359
Nothing.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.782
Sister needs a new dress.

43:40.118 --> 43:44.612
She grows like mustard.

43:44.748 --> 43:46.113
Thank you, Father.

43:46.249 --> 43:48.331
Nothing for me?

44:19.282 --> 44:21.238
I love you.

44:25.247 --> 44:27.954
We need to talk.

44:28.083 --> 44:29.994
Yes, we do.

44:30.126 --> 44:32.913
l was thinking we should take a little break.

44:34.548 --> 44:36.379
- A break?
— From sex.

44:36.508 --> 44:38.624
Just until our wedding night.

44:38.760 --> 44:43.971
I want our wedding night
to be something special.

44:44.099 --> 44:47.136
Don't you agree?

44:47.269 --> 44:50.227
And we have so many practical
things we need to discuss...

44:50.355 --> 44:53.643
Where we're going to live.
I'm happy moving into your villa,

44:53.775 --> 44:57.484
but it will need to be
redecorated from top to bottom.

44:57.612 --> 44:59.318
And I insist you sell your slaves,

44:59.447 --> 45:01.984
male or female,
whom you've previously fucked.

45:02.117 --> 45:03.778
— Atia, |...
- I insist.

45:03.910 --> 45:07.027
And another thing,
you still haven't bought me my wedding gift.

45:07.163 --> 45:09.870
I need to talk.

45:11.042 --> 45:13.374
Well, I'm not stopping you.

45:16.923 --> 45:20.586
When and where you are Gaia,

45:20.719 --> 45:24.337
I, then and there, am Gaius.

45:26.308 --> 45:30.176
When and where you are Gaius,

45:30.312 --> 45:33.475
I, then and there, am Gaia.

47:06.032 --> 47:08.694
Why so gloomy?

47:10.328 --> 47:13.286
No reason. A bit of a headache.

47:13.415 --> 47:17.909
Poor Atia.
| feel for her.

47:18.044 --> 47:23.289
| always thought her attachment to Antony
was purely practical, but look at her.

47:27.387 --> 47:30.845
I think the old girl's genuinely in love with him.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.633
Why did Octavian do this?

47:35.770 --> 47:38.147
Simple.

47:38.273 --> 47:41.140
Octavia is more likely to provide children.

47:41.276 --> 47:46.316
And what is marriage, if not a machine
for the production of babies?

47:46.448 --> 47:48.530
lt's wrong.

47:48.658 --> 47:50.774
It's just wrong.

47:52.287 --> 47:54.699
Careful, friend. Anyone who didn't know better

47:54.831 --> 47:57.493
might think you were in love with Octavia.

48:07.093 --> 48:09.175
Blessings upon you.

48:24.819 --> 48:26.810
I'd rather eat shit.

48:43.338 --> 48:46.876
Please try to see beyond your own desires.

48:47.008 --> 48:49.215
I couldn't very well let you marry Antony.

48:49.344 --> 48:51.630
Everybody knows you were lovers.

48:51.763 --> 48:58.384
The public would assume it was a marriage
of mere sentiment, of lust.

48:58.520 --> 49:02.354
Whereas this match is clearly
a political statement of unity.

49:20.416 --> 49:22.668
— Atia.
— Go away.

49:22.794 --> 49:26.207
You cannot stay in here.
Our guests will wonder where you are.

49:26.339 --> 49:30.082
Well, our guests can go and fuck themselves.

49:37.183 --> 49:39.094
There was no choice.

49:39.227 --> 49:41.263
Your son would have it no other way.

49:41.396 --> 49:42.727
And he is your master?

49:42.856 --> 49:45.939
He is my political partner. Policy dictates that...

49:46.067 --> 49:48.524
Policy be damned. Speak plain.

49:48.653 --> 49:50.518
You love power more than you love me.

49:55.243 --> 49:57.825
This marriage has nothing to do with us.

49:59.414 --> 50:01.279
It changes nothing.

50:01.416 --> 50:05.125
Love, and you and l...

50:05.253 --> 50:06.663
It changes nothing.

50:06.796 --> 50:12.007
| see. First you betray me
and now you propose to betray my daughter.

50:14.470 --> 50:16.961
Forgive me.

51:30.213 --> 51:31.999
Are you ready?

51:44.435 --> 51:45.550
Let's go.

51:45.687 --> 51:47.552
— Wait.
— They're coming!

51:48.731 --> 51:50.346
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

51:50.483 --> 51:52.223
What?

51:52.360 --> 51:57.320
No more killing. Herod is just a man.
His death is useless. It's just more blood.

51:57.448 --> 51:59.530
If we kill him, another will take his place.

51:59.659 --> 52:02.651
— We'll kill him too.
- Not by my hand.

52:05.665 --> 52:07.826
Listen, you made an oath.

52:07.959 --> 52:10.075
I break it, then.

52:10.211 --> 52:12.167
Brother...

52:13.798 --> 52:16.005
l have a wife. I have children.

52:16.134 --> 52:18.716
You're a coward, a snivelling coward.

52:18.845 --> 52:20.756
You always were.

52:20.888 --> 52:22.753
I'll do it alone, then.

52:22.890 --> 52:24.801
No. No!

52:38.990 --> 52:41.356
Brother!

52:42.368 --> 52:44.279
You...

52:44.412 --> 52:46.949
are not

52:47.081 --> 52:49.572
my brother.

53:08.603 --> 53:11.265
This is strange, isn't it?

53:16.361 --> 53:18.352
Look,L”

53:18.488 --> 53:22.982
I know you're not exactly
happy about all this, but...

53:24.160 --> 53:26.902
it is our wedding night.

53:29.290 --> 53:31.576
Do as you like.

53:37.382 --> 53:39.964
Well, if you wouldn't mind just...

54:09.705 --> 54:12.663
Send her bitterness and despair

54:12.792 --> 54:15.829
for all of her life.

54:15.962 --> 54:17.873
Let her taste nothing

54:18.005 --> 54:22.248
but ashes and iron.

54:30.560 --> 54:33.347
I need silphium and hellebore.

54:34.814 --> 54:36.975
You caught it early.

54:39.110 --> 54:40.850
Yeah.

54:43.656 --> 54:45.738
Drink this...

54:48.661 --> 54:50.401
before bed...

54:53.916 --> 54:56.077
and when you wake

54:56.210 --> 54:57.916
in the morning,

54:58.045 --> 54:59.455
problem is over.

54:59.589 --> 55:01.420
How's it taste?

55:04.010 --> 55:05.250
I hate strong flavours.

55:05.386 --> 55:09.504
If you put it in willow tea,
you won't taste it at all.

55:09.640 --> 55:13.258
I'll give you some horsetail
in case there's much bleeding.

55:13.394 --> 55:15.430
No, that's all right.

55:15.563 --> 55:16.928
I don't need that.
