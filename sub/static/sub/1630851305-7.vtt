[narrator]
Previously on Chesapeake Shores:

00:02.711 --> 00:05.088
I'm ready. [groans]

00:05.171 --> 00:06.756
We recovered a bow of a ship.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.883
You need to stop work
while we excavate it.

00:08.967 --> 00:10.176
I went to see Dr. Baum.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.971
-I might have trouble getting pregnant.
-We'll be okay.

00:13.054 --> 00:16.683
My sister's getting married. I have
a plus-one in case you wanna come check.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.395
[Bree]
It is my honor to declare you married.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.689
You may now kiss the groom.

00:22.772 --> 00:23.732
[cheering and whooping]

00:23.815 --> 00:26.943
That ship is really an amazing discovery.
It's just too bad.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.446
Are you pulling out of the build?
Your final decision?

00:29.529 --> 00:30.530
I'm afraid it is.

00:36.161 --> 00:37.287
-Morning.
-Morning.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.206
How did you sleep?

00:40.290 --> 00:41.291
Mm!

00:41.875 --> 00:42.959
Like a baby.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.672
-No bad dreams?
-No.

00:49.048 --> 00:50.133
How did you sleep?

00:51.134 --> 00:52.302
Oh, fine.

00:53.261 --> 00:54.512
Just fine?

00:54.596 --> 00:56.723
Well, you did kick a little.

00:57.390 --> 00:58.224
What?

00:58.308 --> 01:00.560
Yeah, in your sleep. You kicked me.

01:00.643 --> 01:02.604
-And, uh...
-And?

01:02.687 --> 01:03.980
You stole all the blankets.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.608
-You took over the whole bed.
-I did?

01:07.650 --> 01:09.694
But that's the first time
it's ever happened.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.530
And if it happens again,
I can learn to live with it.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.782
You're worth a few kicks.

01:13.865 --> 01:17.285
Abby complained about that when I
was a kid. I thought she was making it up.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.622
She said she'd have to hang onto
the side of the mattress for dear life.

01:20.705 --> 01:23.625
-Maybe we should compare notes.
-It's true.

01:23.708 --> 01:24.709
I'm a bed hog.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.962
-At least you don't snore.
-Wait till I have a cold.

[tranquil music playing]

02:44.289 --> 02:45.415
[Megan] Mmm!

02:46.040 --> 02:50.545
Well, we survived the wedding, ladies,
and it was beautiful.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.423
-It was perfect. Perfect.
-Mm.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.634
Did Mick get to the airport
all right this morning?

02:56.718 --> 03:00.305
And I just got a text.
He did make his connection to Kansas.

03:00.388 --> 03:03.016
Good. We have a shot
at getting this Wichita project,

03:03.099 --> 03:06.686
which we need since Evan Kincaid
pulled out of the hotel.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.063
Well, now that's for sure surprising

03:09.147 --> 03:11.941
because the young man,
Evan, he seems so nice.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.526
Nice, but unpredictable.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.737
-[knocking]
-Speak of the devil.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.946
That's me.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.573
I hope I'm not intruding.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.949
-Hello again.
-Hi.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.034
Uh...

03:21.117 --> 03:24.913
Gran, this is Evan.
I think you met yesterday at the wedding.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.916
Ah. Welcome to the O'Brien home.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.753
-Would you like some coffee now?
-That's very kind. But I can't stay long.

03:31.836 --> 03:32.879
Oh, okay.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.048
Well, while you're having a little visit,

03:35.131 --> 03:37.759
I think we'll take our coffee
and take a little walk.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.761
We'll go take our coffee
down to the Point.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.095
-Shall we?
-Wonderful.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.681
-Okay. Nice seeing you.
-Nice seeing you as well.

03:43.765 --> 03:44.891
-[Megan] Bye.
-Bye.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.519
How can I help you?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.855
I wanted to drop off a wedding gift
for Jess and David.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.357
Oh, how thoughtful.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.817
Well, they made me feel
so at home at their B and B,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.986
so I decided to buy them a unicorn.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.864
It's right outside. Made you look.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.158
I got them a gift certificate.

04:02.784 --> 04:03.910
To what?

04:03.993 --> 04:06.579
To anything they want.
Trip to Greece. Greece itself.

04:07.622 --> 04:11.000
I'm kidding. But actually Greece
is quite affordable at the moment.

04:11.751 --> 04:13.127
Are you kidding me?

04:15.588 --> 04:16.589
What?

04:17.215 --> 04:18.258
Is this you?

04:18.341 --> 04:21.052
-[sighs] Mm-hm.
-Adorable.

04:21.135 --> 04:22.095
Thank you.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.847
[Evan chuckles]

04:24.931 --> 04:26.766
Okay, what do you want?

04:29.310 --> 04:33.606
I, uh... wanted to say goodbye in person,

04:34.607 --> 04:38.027
and I'm sorry, you know,
about our project not working out.

04:38.111 --> 04:38.945
Me too.

04:39.445 --> 04:42.323
Obviously, the lawyers
will iron out all the final details.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.910
You're really not going through with it?
There's no turning back?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.204
Wow, look at that view today.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.832
This doesn't just affect us.

04:50.915 --> 04:53.001
This meant a lot of jobs
to a lot of people.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.586
I know. It wasn't an easy decision.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.092
Oh, boy, is that Mick as a kid?

05:01.175 --> 05:03.803
He looks exactly the same.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.680
[grunts] Oh, ow!

05:05.763 --> 05:07.432
My back! My back!

05:07.515 --> 05:10.059
-Are you okay?
-No, don't touch. Back spasm.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.603
It should-- It should pass.

05:12.687 --> 05:13.771
It usually passes.

05:14.397 --> 05:16.983
-[groans] Unless...
-Unless?

05:17.066 --> 05:18.818
Unless it doesn't. [groans]

05:18.901 --> 05:22.155
-Okay, give me this. Who can I call?
-Mandrake. He knows what to do.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.448
Mandrake.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.409
-Huh. You know a lot of famous people.
-They can't help me now.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.745
I didn't want you to see me like this.

05:28.828 --> 05:30.663
-Like what?
-In pain.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.623
-Human?
-[groans] Whatever.

05:32.707 --> 05:33.541
Okay. Here.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.043
[line dialing]

05:35.668 --> 05:38.254
Mandrake. You're needed.

05:38.337 --> 05:39.338
[sighs]

05:45.803 --> 05:49.098
-Chief is here.
-Probably to announce the new captain.

05:49.640 --> 05:50.850
Who do you think it'll be?

05:52.268 --> 05:55.772
My money's on Chris Sutton from Nine.
With Mike as the new lieutenant.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.151
Sarah, I've been looking for you.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.904
O'Brien, would you excuse us for a second?

06:03.654 --> 06:06.157
Sure.
I need to cross-check some inventory.

06:08.868 --> 06:11.996
Well, Sarah, it's official.
Mike Herrmann is gonna be the new captain.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.581
That's great. He's a good man.

06:14.290 --> 06:18.044
And you're gonna be the new lieutenant.
That is, if you want it.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.929
-[Mandrake] Does that hurt, sir?
-[groans] Ow! Yes.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.847
-And how about now?
-[groans]

06:29.931 --> 06:31.599
Yes! Are you enjoying this?

06:31.682 --> 06:34.268
I always enjoy my work, sir.
I'm gonna turn you over now.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.104
-Will it hurt?
-A great deal.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.482
Remember, that which does not kill us
only makes us stronger.

06:39.565 --> 06:43.069
-[Evan] What if I don't wanna be stronger?
-Would one of you lend a hand?

06:43.152 --> 06:44.445
Uh, what can I do?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.864
-Just grab both legs and turn when I turn.
-Okay.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.618
Sweet jam, peaches and cream!

06:50.701 --> 06:53.121
[groans] I would say more,
but your grandmother is listening.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.247
Oh, I've heard it all.

06:55.206 --> 06:58.751
-Your back is spasming, sir.
-Tell me something I don't know.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.586
So this has happened before?

07:00.670 --> 07:03.548
[groaning] Not for a couple of years.
I thought I was over it.

07:03.631 --> 07:06.217
It's a chronic condition, ma'am.
It should right itself soon.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.053
Call a private ambulance.
Get them to move me to my house.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.680
[Nell] Don't be ridiculous.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.933
All that lifting and that jostling,
that wouldn't help it a bit.

07:14.016 --> 07:17.687
You're going to stay on this sofa
until you can stand up alone.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.605
-Gran--
-I don't want to impose.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.107
He really doesn't.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.442
Don't be silly.

07:22.525 --> 07:26.279
Why, the man is hurt.
And we are going to help you get better.

07:26.362 --> 07:29.282
We're going to take care of you
and see to it.

07:29.365 --> 07:31.868
So have a muffin.

07:31.951 --> 07:34.078
No, I couldn't. Um...

07:38.541 --> 07:42.170
-That's a delicious muffin.
-And there's more where that came from.

07:42.253 --> 07:44.338
[Evan]
I guess I could stay a little while.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.216
Mandrake, get me my computer
and my work phone.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.510
-I'll do the Lisbon call from here.
-Yes, sir.

07:49.594 --> 07:50.720
Okay.

07:51.804 --> 07:55.475
Mandrake? Tell me, how long
do these spasms usually last for?

07:55.558 --> 07:56.559
It's hard to say.

07:56.642 --> 08:00.062
The last time we were in Brazzaville,
it only lasted a couple of hours.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.148
-But in Zagreb...
-That bad?

08:02.231 --> 08:04.901
Let's just say we're not welcome
in Croatia anymore.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.697
[groans]

08:18.164 --> 08:18.998
You okay?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.210
I'm okay.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.880
It's just, you seem kind of quiet.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.513
Chief Lee offered me
the lieutenancy today.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.599
What? Why wouldn't you tell me?

08:37.475 --> 08:39.060
Guess I was too shocked.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.480
I said I'd think about it.
Give him an answer next week.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.441
-That's great. I mean, that's wonderful.
-Is it?

08:46.025 --> 08:47.860
Do I really wanna move up that fast?

08:47.944 --> 08:50.655
Do I wanna be a supervisor?
I hate supervisors.

08:50.738 --> 08:52.657
You hate supervisors that aren't you.

08:53.449 --> 08:56.536
And it's more money, which we could use.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.995
Yeah, it is more money.

08:58.829 --> 09:01.165
It's the first step
of becoming chief yourself,

09:01.249 --> 09:05.336
which is what you've always wanted.
You get to tell everyone what to do.

09:06.254 --> 09:08.381
I do like telling people what to do.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.466
Okay, so what's wrong?

09:11.551 --> 09:15.513
I'm just not ready
to stop going on runs yet.

09:16.597 --> 09:17.431
I'll miss it.

09:18.140 --> 09:20.268
I'll miss the rush, you know?

09:20.351 --> 09:21.852
Yeah, I know.

09:22.979 --> 09:24.397
And once I'm pregnant,

09:24.480 --> 09:26.816
I'll have to
give that all up anyway, so...

09:27.400 --> 09:29.485
-Will you?
-Won't I?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.322
Dr. Armstrong said I had to be careful.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.827
Are you saying that you're not sure
you wanna take the lieutenancy position

09:37.910 --> 09:39.161
or are you saying that...

09:40.663 --> 09:42.832
you might want to wait
to try to have kids?

09:45.209 --> 09:46.919
I don't know what I'm saying.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.005
[pensive music playing]

09:53.217 --> 09:54.927
[Caitlyn]
I don't see why we can't get a dog.

09:55.803 --> 09:57.096
I never said we couldn't.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.849
-So we can get a dog?
-Well, I--

09:59.932 --> 10:03.394
-Did you see what they did there?
-I did, and I'm impressed.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.104
[laughing]

10:05.187 --> 10:06.480
We can talk about it.

10:06.564 --> 10:07.607
[both] Yay!

10:07.690 --> 10:11.152
-Could I have some more chicken, please?
-Oh, Evan, coming right up.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.862
I'll take it to him.

10:18.826 --> 10:19.827
How are you feeling?

10:19.910 --> 10:21.579
Okay, as long as I don't move.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.372
Have you seen pictures
from the excavation?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.583
The ship looks amazing. See?

10:25.666 --> 10:27.585
Yeah. The Smithsonian
is very excited about it.

10:27.668 --> 10:30.296
Almost worth it that we were there,
so they could find it.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.007
Almost. [clears throat]

10:33.090 --> 10:36.969
I guess this is awkward, huh? I come by,
pull out of the deal, then I'm stuck here.

10:37.053 --> 10:39.221
It is awkward.

10:41.515 --> 10:44.185
So how did you hurt your back?

10:44.268 --> 10:46.312
Originally?
Uh, I was in a little accident.

10:46.395 --> 10:47.813
Oh, was it serious?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.231
I walked away from it.

10:49.815 --> 10:50.650
Good chicken.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.527
-Tell Gran.
-Good chicken, Mrs. O'Brien.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.322
Oh, Evan. Well, for sure now.

10:56.947 --> 10:58.783
It's nice of you to say so.

10:58.866 --> 11:02.703
And for dessert,
we have blueberry crumble.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.123
Oh, well, thank you, that is very sweet.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.792
But I should get going.

11:07.875 --> 11:09.418
[groaning]

11:09.502 --> 11:11.587
-Or not.
-[Nell] You stay right there.

11:11.671 --> 11:15.341
I'll get some blankets
and I'll make up the sofa for you. Okay.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.139
-Awkward.
-Awkward.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.560
[upbeat music playing]

11:35.861 --> 11:38.114
-Thanks for helping me out, Kev.
-Are you kidding?

11:38.906 --> 11:42.201
Helping out my little brother and
swinging a sledgehammer. It's a win-win.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.413
Hey. You guys need any help?
I brought extra hands.

11:45.496 --> 11:46.455
These hands.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.084
-The more the merrier. Thanks, Luke.
-[Luke] Hey, no problem.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.420
-Nice space.
-Thanks.

11:52.503 --> 11:54.505
Can you see it as a law office?

11:54.588 --> 11:55.548
Yeah. Why not?

11:55.631 --> 11:57.216
So, um, how do we get started?

11:58.467 --> 12:00.344
-Bring that nail puller.
-Okay.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.179
Spoken like a true lawyer.

12:04.098 --> 12:05.891
Uh, so, what can I do?

12:05.975 --> 12:08.185
Grab a pair of goggles and stand back.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.688
Got it.

12:12.440 --> 12:13.691
Whoa!

12:14.108 --> 12:17.153
Kevin, you working
through some stuff there?

12:17.736 --> 12:19.697
What? No.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.033
-Maybe.
-You want to talk about it?

12:23.117 --> 12:25.578
'Cause if you do,
I have some stuff I could talk about.

12:25.661 --> 12:28.622
Yeah, no,
I think I'd rather just break some stuff.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.416
Go for it.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.835
Oh! Hey. Whoo.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.717
So your very own law practice, huh?

12:39.800 --> 12:42.511
Looks like it.
Let me guess, you hate lawyers.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.431
-Why do you say that?
-Because everybody hates lawyers.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.809
Except for other lawyers, huh?

12:48.893 --> 12:50.769
Oh, no, we hate them too.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.855
[both laugh]

12:57.443 --> 12:59.361
Hey, uh, can I ask you something?

13:00.154 --> 13:01.655
For a friend of a friend.

13:02.615 --> 13:05.201
Sure. But this friend of a friend
would be you, right?

13:05.284 --> 13:06.118
Yeah.

13:07.161 --> 13:10.247
Look, your dad and Kevin
have been just great to me,

13:10.331 --> 13:12.166
getting the job at The Bridge...

13:12.750 --> 13:14.627
But-- They already know this...

13:16.378 --> 13:17.379
I've served time.

13:17.463 --> 13:18.672
Wow.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.090
Yeah.

13:20.174 --> 13:23.344
Okay. So Dad and Kev know,
have you told Bree?

13:23.427 --> 13:27.306
I'm gonna tell her this weekend.
Just waiting for the right time.

13:27.389 --> 13:32.311
People don't always react
so well to the, uh... news.

13:32.394 --> 13:35.523
Well, she'll be all right with it.
But tell her, okay?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.191
Yeah, I will.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.734
Okay then.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.196
-You're a good brother.
-She's a good sister.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.659
-Now, what was it you wanted to ask me?
-Oh, never mind. I--

13:46.742 --> 13:49.745
No, you're helping me out,
so you get free legal advice.

13:49.828 --> 13:50.663
Okay.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.544
Look, my parole officer,
he's just really coming down on me hard.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.212
I'm towing the line,

13:58.295 --> 14:00.673
trying to do
every little thing required of me,

14:00.756 --> 14:04.969
but no matter what I do, he's just--
It seems like he has it out for me.

14:05.761 --> 14:11.517
Is there anything I can do
to get switched maybe to another PO?

14:11.600 --> 14:14.895
I'm not sure,
but I'd be happy to look into it for you.

14:15.938 --> 14:18.566
Thanks, man. I really appreciate it.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.235
-Yeah.
-Cool.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.783
Not half bad.

14:27.867 --> 14:28.826
Thanks.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.452
Keep going.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.539
She's got an eye.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.251
-For composition. For color.
-Ah.

14:37.334 --> 14:38.460
Is that right?

14:38.544 --> 14:40.546
You're either born with it or not.

14:41.171 --> 14:43.173
And you were born with it.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.884
My curse.

14:44.967 --> 14:45.968
[scoffs]

14:46.468 --> 14:48.387
Why don't you paint anymore?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.098
I've painted it all. I'm sick of it.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.559
It's new to her.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.855
Hm. So is that why you came over here?

14:57.938 --> 14:58.898
Why else?

15:00.149 --> 15:04.945
Certainly not to hear your daughter-in-law
try to sell me on that show of my work.

15:05.654 --> 15:11.577
Well, now, I thought
maybe it was for the muffins.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.414
[chuckles] You do make good muffins.

15:15.956 --> 15:16.957
Enjoy.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.087
Carrie's art is really good, huh?

15:22.922 --> 15:26.425
Yeah. Gran says that she has a gift.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.718
Do you think I have one?

15:28.802 --> 15:30.387
A gift? Of course you do.

15:31.055 --> 15:31.889
I don't know.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.642
Honey, you just haven't found it yet.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.311
You need to explore.
None of us found ours overnight.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.646
What did you all find?

15:39.313 --> 15:40.314
Different things.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.191
Carrie's is art.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.776
Auntie Bree's is writing.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.444
Mine is numbers.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.405
You'll find yours. Trust me.

15:51.742 --> 15:52.785
What's his gift?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.286
His?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.122
Uh...

15:57.206 --> 16:01.752
His gift is...
that he never stops thinking.

16:01.835 --> 16:03.587
[upbeat music playing]

16:03.671 --> 16:06.215
-[thudding]
-[Kevin grunting]

16:06.799 --> 16:09.969
Are you sure there's nothing on your mind?

16:11.804 --> 16:15.557
-Yeah, okay, there might be something.
-Okay. Go.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.184
Sarah got offered a promotion.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.602
To lieutenant.

16:18.686 --> 16:20.604
That sounds like great news.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.940
You'd think so, right?

16:23.023 --> 16:25.275
But she's not sure
that she wants to take it.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.112
Okay. Why not?

16:29.363 --> 16:33.117
She says she is not ready to give up
going on runs, which I understand.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.286
But she's thinking...

16:37.496 --> 16:40.165
she might wanna put off
trying to have a baby for a while.

16:40.666 --> 16:41.667
Oh.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.587
And it's fine because...

16:48.340 --> 16:49.925
we have time, you know?

16:52.386 --> 16:54.596
We've always been on the same page,

16:54.680 --> 16:56.974
and now I'm starting
to worry that maybe we're not.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.270
I'm not an expert on marriage,

17:01.353 --> 17:06.025
but isn't the deal that you have
to figure out how to be on different pages

17:06.108 --> 17:08.318
but still remain in the same book?

17:11.905 --> 17:12.740
You're right.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.909
-You're very smart.
-Well...

17:16.660 --> 17:18.746
-You should be a writer, you know that?
-Eh, I try.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.207
Just talk to her.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.085
Yeah. I will.

17:25.669 --> 17:28.255
Thank you. What did you wanna talk about?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.050
[sighs] Um...

17:31.884 --> 17:33.552
-Last weekend.
-Oh.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.679
-You mean juggling two guys and a wedding?
-Okay.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.849
-I think it's very impressive.
-Thank you. I cannot be that person.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.851
So pick one.

17:40.934 --> 17:41.935
Yeah.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.187
[sighs]

17:44.313 --> 17:46.607
I have to let Jerry Trask down easy.

17:48.108 --> 17:51.820
So if you were him,
how would you like me to let you down?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.447
Get right to it.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.532
Pull it off like a Band-Aid.
It's the only way.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.869
That's what I thought you'd say.
I don't wanna be the bad guy.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.537
Trust me. It's better this way.

18:00.621 --> 18:04.500
Let him get on with his life.
Let him know where he stands.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.544
Yep. You're right.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.588
That's what I should do.

18:12.674 --> 18:16.762
It's good, Klaus,
but FYP tactic is too mysterious.

18:17.346 --> 18:20.808
Make it so that if it appears,
you're more likely to get similar content.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.937
Right, so it'll gain
more momentum in real time. Yeah.

18:25.020 --> 18:25.854
Okay.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.525
-Mr. Kincaid?
-Call me Evan.

18:30.150 --> 18:33.654
-Are you really thinking all the time?
-Uh, I am.

18:33.737 --> 18:36.740
'Cause when I watch those videos,
Mom says I'm wasting my time.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.617
Well, that's just her opinion.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.954
I think it's a way to relax.
But in my case, this is work.

18:42.704 --> 18:45.124
-It is?
-Mm-hm. I own this site.

18:45.207 --> 18:47.167
-You do?
-Mm-hm. Bought it last year.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.211
-That's so cool.
-I think so.

18:49.294 --> 18:51.547
-Do you like computers?
-I like video games.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.550
-Have you ever thought about making one?
-You can do that?

18:54.633 --> 18:55.509
Sure. Here.

18:56.218 --> 18:57.928
[groans] Let me show you.

18:58.011 --> 19:00.889
[upbeat music playing]

19:04.268 --> 19:08.147
Well, if it isn't Bree O'Brien,
the famous author.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.190
-Hi, Jerry.
-Oh.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.109
That's not good.

19:14.027 --> 19:17.030
Um, Jerry, I know that
I invited you to the wedding.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.032
And I had a wonderful time.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.618
I did too. I just, um...

19:23.078 --> 19:25.706
I just need to make sure
that we're on the same page.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.166
Um...

19:28.125 --> 19:30.210
I don't think we are, but go on.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.045
I don't-- Um--

19:32.129 --> 19:35.632
I don't think that I'm feeling for you
what you're feeling for me.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.470
And, you know,
we're working together. I just--

19:41.180 --> 19:43.182
I think it's best
to just rip off the Band-Aid now,

19:43.265 --> 19:44.600
so that it doesn't get weird.

19:44.683 --> 19:48.187
I totally understand.
You don't have to say another word.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.981
-Really?
-Yeah.

19:51.064 --> 19:54.776
Timing is everything.
And, um, this isn't the right time.

19:56.278 --> 19:59.072
So back to being on a professional basis.

19:59.156 --> 20:00.032
Agreed?

20:02.075 --> 20:05.871
-Absolutely. Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me for anything.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.081
-Okay.
-Um...

20:08.165 --> 20:10.709
Okay. Well, good luck with your class.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.085
Yeah. Thank you so much.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.003
-Yeah.
-Okay.

20:13.086 --> 20:14.129
-Bye.
-See you.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.301
[sighs]

20:21.595 --> 20:23.055
So how's it going with you and Jay?

20:23.889 --> 20:24.765
Uh...

20:25.849 --> 20:27.267
It's fine. I like him.

20:28.101 --> 20:28.977
But?

20:29.478 --> 20:31.980
But nothing. He's nice and thoughtful.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.442
But you're not ready to take the plunge.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.654
What--? What do you mean? What plunge?

20:39.988 --> 20:42.491
You know what plunge. The plunge.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.954
Are you dating? Are you--?
Are you boyfriend and girlfriend?

20:47.037 --> 20:48.830
Can we talk about something else?

20:48.914 --> 20:52.084
What does, uh, Jay think about Evan
spending the night at your place?

20:52.668 --> 20:56.546
Evan did not spend the night.
He's laid up with a bad back.

20:56.630 --> 20:57.464
In your house.

20:58.757 --> 21:03.136
I did not tell Jay because he has an idea
that Evan has a thing for me,

21:03.220 --> 21:04.846
like, likes me.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.556
I don't think that's weird.

21:07.057 --> 21:09.685
Trust me, Evan Kincaid does not like me.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.270
Do you like Evan Kincaid?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.480
All right. I'm changing the subject.

21:13.563 --> 21:14.731
How's married life?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.400
Oh, it's perfect.

21:17.943 --> 21:22.489
Then why are you here with your big sister
instead of hanging off your husband's arm?

21:22.572 --> 21:24.700
Yeah, okay. So I have to
talk to you about something.

21:24.783 --> 21:26.785
-Mm-hm.
-Not that it's a problem.

21:27.327 --> 21:30.539
You know in movies
how it always ends with the wedding?

21:30.622 --> 21:33.542
-Mm-hm.
-It goes wedding, happy ending, it's over.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.295
-Mm-hm.
-Well, what happens after that?

21:36.378 --> 21:39.006
What happens
if you find out you're a bed hog?

21:39.089 --> 21:41.883
-What are you talking about?
-David said I kick him in my sleep.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.511
-[gasps] You still do that?
-[gasps] I did that?

21:45.220 --> 21:47.264
When we were little
and we would go on family trips

21:47.347 --> 21:49.016
and we'd have to share a hotel room.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.393
Can you imagine
spending the night with a kangaroo?

21:52.477 --> 21:53.312
I can.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.815
But it's okay.
It was right after Mom left,

21:56.898 --> 22:00.610
and you were having some anxiety.

22:00.694 --> 22:03.030
Maybe. But what do I have
to be anxious about now?

22:03.113 --> 22:05.240
I'm really not a licensed therapist.

22:05.324 --> 22:08.493
You're better than a licensed therapist,
you're my big sister.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.412
-[chuckles]
-Oh.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.500
Think there's something going on there?

22:16.209 --> 22:17.336
He's not her usual type.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.670
No, he is not.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.921
Hm.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.257
[tranquil music playing]

22:25.844 --> 22:27.596
Yes, Evan, I'll get right on that.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.557
This is amazing. Abby, look at this.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.768
This is what they think
that ship looked like.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.603
-Oh.
-From what we've uncovered.

22:34.686 --> 22:37.731
Could you imagine sailing
all the way across the ocean in that?

22:37.814 --> 22:39.775
-It would be crowded.
-[Evan] Tell me about it.

22:39.858 --> 22:43.236
Oh, here are the settlement papers
I had drawn up to end our agreement.

22:43.320 --> 22:47.741
It's pretty fair. It's more than fair.
Mandrake, could you read them to her?

22:48.658 --> 22:50.160
I can read them myself.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.163
Really? I always miss things
when I read them with my eyes.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.249
-I have to read them with my ears.
-Okay. Uh, Caitlyn,

22:56.333 --> 22:57.959
do you wanna play that up in your room?

22:58.043 --> 23:00.462
Oh. She's not playing.
She's designing a video game.

23:01.296 --> 23:02.589
-Mm-hm.
-[Evan] Hey, can I see?

23:05.092 --> 23:08.428
So far, I've gotten the boulder
to roll down the hill and crush the troll.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.473
Good, I hate trolls.
This is not half bad, Caitlyn.

23:11.556 --> 23:12.390
Keep going.

23:13.016 --> 23:14.309
But you're leaving.

23:14.392 --> 23:18.730
-How can I show it to you when I finish?
-I'll give you my private e-mail address.

23:18.814 --> 23:21.441
-Just don't share it with your mother.
-Okay.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.111
[Abby] Wow.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.445
You're full of surprises.

23:25.529 --> 23:28.657
I'm good with kids. Mandrake says
it's because I'm young at heart.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.867
I said you were
a regressed adolescent, sir.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.452
Same difference.

23:33.286 --> 23:37.541
Oh. It is almost 6:00. Excuse me,
I have to get on a call with the coast.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.253
Uh, Mandrake.

23:41.336 --> 23:45.423
Actually, I don't even know.
Is Mandrake your first or your last name?

23:45.507 --> 23:46.466
Neither, ma'am.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.885
-Your name's not Mandrake?
-No.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.470
It amuses him to call me that.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.681
Wow, it must be exhausting to be him.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.182
You have no idea, ma'am.

23:54.641 --> 23:56.518
Uh, please don't call me ma'am.
Call me Abby.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.145
All right. Abby.

23:58.937 --> 24:02.816
Uh, listen, does he really not read?
Is he that lazy?

24:02.899 --> 24:05.277
Not lazy, Abby. Anything but lazy.

24:05.360 --> 24:08.363
-Don't tell me he can't read.
-Not that he can't.

24:08.446 --> 24:09.489
He's not ashamed of it.

24:09.573 --> 24:12.200
Evan suffered from dyslexia
when he was a child.

24:12.284 --> 24:13.702
It went undiagnosed,

24:13.785 --> 24:15.912
he was considered
to be lazy and unmotivated.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.874
One of the reasons
why he didn't go to university.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.792
He has since overcome that hardship,

24:20.876 --> 24:22.794
but reading
is not one of his favorite activities.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.589
Wow, I had no idea. Um...

24:26.548 --> 24:28.049
He really is a self-made man, isn't he?

24:28.133 --> 24:32.095
Entirely. No one believed in him,
so Evan had to believe in himself.

24:32.179 --> 24:34.973
-You've been with him a long time?
-Long enough.

24:35.056 --> 24:38.101
How'd he hurt his back?
He said he had some sort of accident.

24:38.185 --> 24:41.980
He's never shared that with me,
but perhaps one day he will tell you.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.491
And then the dragon
saves the princess from the evil prince.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.036
-Ah, you are learning.
-[Jay] Hello.

24:56.119 --> 24:59.748
I come bearing PTA Silent Auction info,

24:59.831 --> 25:02.584
which you so foolishly agreed
to help out on.

25:02.667 --> 25:06.671
You caught me at a weak moment and you
plied me with hot chocolate at Sally's.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.632
-Well, I'm fiendish that way.
-[Abby] Mm-hm.

25:08.715 --> 25:09.549
Hello, Caitlyn.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.426
Hi, Mr. Ross. What's your gift?

25:12.469 --> 25:13.678
Uh...

25:13.762 --> 25:15.305
She's, uh, working through some stuff.

25:15.388 --> 25:16.431
I am.

25:16.514 --> 25:17.599
Well, aren't we all.

25:18.516 --> 25:21.394
Huh. You know,
I never really thought about it.

25:21.937 --> 25:22.771
My gift?

25:24.022 --> 25:25.357
Teaching, I guess.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.318
-And music. I play guitar a little.
-[Caitlyn] Hm.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.778
How do I not know that?

25:29.861 --> 25:31.071
Well, you never asked.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.073
-I have a guitar.
-Do you play?

25:33.156 --> 25:36.159
I had a couple of lessons,
but I never kept up with it.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.995
Oh. Well, I would be
more than happy to teach you.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.455
-Could I, Mom?
-Sure.

25:40.538 --> 25:42.457
All right. Well, I look forward to it.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.585
-Uh, text me some days.
-I will do that.

25:45.669 --> 25:46.753
Okay.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.839
Mom, do you like Jay?

25:51.132 --> 25:52.550
Of course I like Jay.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.010
But do you "like" like him?

25:54.094 --> 25:56.513
Is this what you
and your friends talk about?

25:56.596 --> 25:58.765
Yeah, but they give me answers.

26:01.101 --> 26:02.018
Ah, ladies.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.980
-I need your opinion.
-[Abby] Mm-hm?

26:05.063 --> 26:09.734
For sure. Be honest, which scarf?
The white with the red or the multi-color?

26:09.818 --> 26:11.027
The white and red.

26:11.111 --> 26:12.862
-Oh! Okay.
-[Abby] Why?

26:12.946 --> 26:14.656
Huh? Just wondering.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.866
-Okay, you look nice.
-Oh, thank you.

26:18.618 --> 26:21.079
-Does Gran--?
-Have a date?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.918
She was a wonderful woman, Elaine.

26:27.627 --> 26:28.586
My muse.

26:28.670 --> 26:33.174
I'm not sure if she inspired me
or I just painted to impress her.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.344
It's all changed, hasn't it?

26:36.428 --> 26:37.512
Oh, well...

26:39.014 --> 26:39.848
not so much.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.641
I don't even know what I'm eating.

26:42.559 --> 26:43.977
It's called a shawarma.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.396
I can't even spell that.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.605
Do you like it?

26:47.689 --> 26:49.983
-It's tasty.
-You better learn to spell it.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.151
[both laugh]

26:51.234 --> 26:52.068
Maybe.

26:52.610 --> 26:56.156
What happened to that Chinese restaurant
that was over there?

26:56.239 --> 26:58.992
Oh! That was the Garden View.

26:59.534 --> 27:02.370
The best spring rolls in town.
Diane Yang ran it.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.705
Whatever happened to her?

27:03.788 --> 27:08.251
-Oh, well, she passed away many years ago.
-Typical.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.045
That's the way of this world.

27:10.795 --> 27:15.050
We live and we die,
and you better make the most of it.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.720
Your husband Charles
built that fountain, didn't he?

27:18.803 --> 27:20.221
Indeed, he did.

27:21.765 --> 27:22.599
Actually...

27:23.892 --> 27:25.018
he built it twice.

27:25.935 --> 27:30.231
The first time, he didn't like it,
so he tore it all down one night

27:30.940 --> 27:31.983
and started over.

27:32.692 --> 27:35.320
Nobody else had a problem with it but him.

27:35.403 --> 27:38.114
But he was like that.

27:38.948 --> 27:39.824
Hm.

27:48.541 --> 27:51.086
[serene music playing]

27:56.299 --> 27:58.259
-Cold, honey?
-No.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.346
Then what's with the socks?

28:01.429 --> 28:02.389
The socks?

28:02.472 --> 28:04.891
They are to remind me of my feet.

28:05.975 --> 28:08.061
So that I won't kick you all night.

28:08.686 --> 28:09.521
Jess...

28:09.604 --> 28:13.358
I promise I will never hog the bed again.

28:13.441 --> 28:17.028
Look, I'm so sorry I said anything.
I didn't mean to offend you.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.863
-I actually thought it was funny.
-Funny?

28:18.947 --> 28:21.074
-Mm-hm.
-Abby said I'm a kangaroo.

28:21.991 --> 28:25.578
Well, yes,
but you are a beautiful kangaroo.

28:26.162 --> 28:27.330
You're my kangaroo.

28:27.414 --> 28:30.166
It's not funny.
What if our marriage is doomed?

28:30.250 --> 28:32.877
Our marriage is not doomed.
I'll learn to dodge your feet.

28:32.961 --> 28:36.714
I'm serious. Maybe I'm kicking you
at night because I'm anxious.

28:36.798 --> 28:38.425
What do I have to be anxious about?

28:38.508 --> 28:39.968
Well, I don't know.

28:40.593 --> 28:42.429
I mean, let's think about it.

28:43.304 --> 28:44.305
Um...

28:44.931 --> 28:48.643
We're running a business
that has a very high failure rate.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.104
You just completely
changed your entire life.

28:51.771 --> 28:56.109
You just made a commitment to tie yourself
to another person till death do you part.

28:56.192 --> 28:58.737
You're thinking that
you might not even want kids,

28:58.820 --> 29:00.363
and you're not sure how I feel about it,

29:00.447 --> 29:03.324
and you just found out
the furnace needs to be replaced.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.869
-It does?
-Oh, yeah, it needs to be replaced.

29:05.952 --> 29:07.370
Oh, great.

29:07.454 --> 29:10.081
I'm anxious too.
I'm anxious about everything, but...

29:11.124 --> 29:13.960
Let's just be anxious together.

29:15.420 --> 29:19.257
-That's what a marriage is.
-Couples going through life terrified?

29:19.340 --> 29:20.925
Yeah, sometimes.

29:21.009 --> 29:23.470
What do you really feel
about the kid thing?

29:24.304 --> 29:26.639
You think that's what this is about?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.934
Either that
or I have restless legs syndrome.

29:30.018 --> 29:31.603
I don't even know what that is.

29:32.145 --> 29:36.149
Well, either way, I love you...

29:37.609 --> 29:39.319
and I love your legs...

29:40.653 --> 29:43.573
and I wanna help you live
the life that you wanna live.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.452
Hey!

30:07.263 --> 30:09.849
So have you decided?
About the lieutenancy?

30:10.475 --> 30:13.520
Yes. I've decided
about five times this morning.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.689
The problem is,
is that I keep deciding different things.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.108
To take it, to not take it, to take it.

30:19.192 --> 30:20.777
It's okay. You have plenty of time.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.572
-When does the chief want an answer again?
-At the pancake breakfast.

30:25.156 --> 30:27.534
So tomorrow. All right, well,

30:27.617 --> 30:30.662
whatever you decide to tell him,
it's your career.

30:30.745 --> 30:32.288
It has to be your choice.

30:32.789 --> 30:34.123
Sarah. Hey.

30:34.207 --> 30:36.960
-Uh, Chief Lee wants a word with you.
-I'll be right up.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.004
Oh, boy. What if he wants an answer now?

30:40.088 --> 30:41.756
Well, then you'll have to decide.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.217
And whatever you decide, I'm with you.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.168
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe we should, uh, get a drink.

31:19.252 --> 31:20.211
-You thirsty?
-Sure.

31:20.295 --> 31:23.172
All right. Let's do it.
Let's go raid the fridge, okay?

31:23.256 --> 31:24.549
What do you got? Anything good?

Wow. You guys sounded wonderful out there.

-Yup. Coming up. Do you want a brownie?
-[Jay] Brownies and milk?

31:37.729 --> 31:40.481
I'm found out I'm lactose intolerant.
I can't have milk.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.066
Oh. Can I?

31:42.483 --> 31:43.985
Uh, one milk coming up.

31:44.068 --> 31:46.154
[Evan] Could I have some lemonade?

I love lemonade.

This is Evan Kincaid.

31:53.703 --> 31:54.787
[Jay] Is it?

31:54.871 --> 31:57.457
Mm-hm. Evan threw his back out.

31:57.540 --> 31:58.917
This is Jay Ross.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.628

32:01.711 --> 32:02.754
You're fantastic.

Sorry, I would get up,
but I'm incapacitated.

Abby has been nice enough
to let me crash here a while.

-That is nice.
-Mm. Not that I had much of a choice.

-Here's your lemonade.
-Thanks, Caitlyn.

Mmm!

Oh, I love these straws.
I remember these from when I was a kid.

-Jay, do you remember these?
-Yeah, I remember them.

32:24.442 --> 32:27.654
I've been thinking about learning
to play guitar. Could you give me lessons?

32:27.737 --> 32:30.698
-It's not really what I do.
-Oh. What do you do, Jay?

32:31.115 --> 32:34.202
-Well, I'm a grade school teacher.
-No. That's fascinating.

32:34.285 --> 32:38.289
-Yeah.
-Okay. Uh, let's let Evan get some rest.

32:38.373 --> 32:40.291
-[Evan] Nice meeting you, Jay.
-Yeah, you too.

32:43.586 --> 32:46.422
-Interesting guy.
-Yeah. You could say that.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.758
He's in pain, but he likes the attention.

32:48.841 --> 32:50.843
Doesn't he get enough of that?
He's a billionaire.

32:52.387 --> 32:53.930
Yeah. But...

32:55.431 --> 32:58.810
you know, there's... more to him
than what you see on the surface,

32:58.893 --> 33:01.604
like, apparently,
he's never had a real family.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.064
Oh, poor guy.

33:03.147 --> 33:07.860
Wow. Am I actually feeling sorry
for a world-famous tycoon?

33:07.944 --> 33:10.530
No. No, I'm not. Not at all. No.

34:20.516 --> 34:21.642
Just give me a sec.

34:22.226 --> 34:24.896
Hey, O'Brien.
We've got a call. Priority 2.

34:24.979 --> 34:27.231
Possible Protocol 19 on Market Street.

34:27.774 --> 34:28.691
[Kevin] Uh, right.

34:28.775 --> 34:31.277
Uh, sorry, you gotta find someone else.
Duty calls.

34:33.279 --> 34:34.614
Need a hand with that?

34:34.697 --> 34:37.075
Sure. Can you spot me
while I climb up and fix this banner?

34:37.158 --> 34:39.452
You spot me. I'll climb. I'm used to it.

34:39.535 --> 34:41.871
Whatever you say, lieutenant.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.290
You heard about that, huh?

34:44.373 --> 34:48.294
It's hard to keep a secret at the station.
So is it true?

34:49.587 --> 34:51.923
-It is under discussion.
-[siren wailing]

34:56.677 --> 34:59.138
-Come on down. I'll move the ladder.
-No, I got it.

34:59.222 --> 35:01.516
[suspenseful music playing]

35:01.599 --> 35:02.975
Hey, you okay?

35:06.062 --> 35:06.979
Sarah!

35:09.607 --> 35:11.359
I don't understand why you--

35:12.652 --> 35:14.070
Oh. Mm-hm.

35:16.155 --> 35:18.908
Yes. I will see you this weekend.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.161
Bad news?

35:22.912 --> 35:24.247
That was Erin Kinley.

35:24.330 --> 35:25.998
She runs a gallery in SoHo.

35:26.082 --> 35:29.585
She said Driscoll
made a deal with her back in the mid-'80s

35:29.669 --> 35:31.170
just after his wife passed away.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.340
-What kind of deal?
-She said he gave her the exclusive rights

35:34.423 --> 35:37.385
to any and all of his artwork
in perpetuity.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.887
She owns all the rights to his paintings?

35:39.971 --> 35:43.641
That's what she says.
And then she refuses to let me show them.

35:43.724 --> 35:45.685
That's ridiculous.
Even if she owns all the rights,

35:45.768 --> 35:47.728
wouldn't they be worth more
if he had a big show?

35:47.812 --> 35:48.646
Yeah, maybe.

35:49.313 --> 35:53.025
But she said she prefers to wait
until they are higher in value.

35:53.109 --> 35:53.943
What does that mean?

35:54.026 --> 35:57.822
The value of an artist's work
goes up exponentially right after he dies.

35:57.905 --> 35:59.991
She said she shouldn't have to wait long.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.284
Wow, that's cold.

36:01.367 --> 36:03.452
On the bright side,
she did tell me thank you

36:03.536 --> 36:05.371
for talking Driscoll into having a show.

36:05.454 --> 36:09.208
She said she would consider
giving me a small commission on the sales.

36:09.292 --> 36:13.171
-Wow. What did you say to that?
-I told her I appreciated that.

36:13.671 --> 36:16.883
Then I told her exactly
where she could go put her commission.

36:17.925 --> 36:19.594
She's gonna be here this weekend.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.221
She wants to go
take a look at "her paintings."

36:22.305 --> 36:23.598
So, what are you gonna do?

36:23.681 --> 36:27.685
She thinks she can scare me
by pulling that New York art world card.

36:27.768 --> 36:30.605
She doesn't know
I have a few of those cards of my own.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.566
Hmph!

36:37.737 --> 36:38.571
Evan?

36:39.071 --> 36:39.906
Evan?

36:42.450 --> 36:44.535
It's a miracle. I'm healed.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.996
I think it was Nell's blueberry crumble
that did it.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.582
I'm sending a sample to the Mayo Clinic
to have it analyzed.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.084
Well, I'm glad you are feeling better.

36:52.168 --> 36:55.630
I can't thank you enough
for your enforced hospitality.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.799
These were truly
some of the best days of my life.

36:58.883 --> 37:02.386
I'm gonna buy a sofa just like that
and take it with me everywhere.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.263
Well, my sofa is flattered.

37:04.764 --> 37:08.142
Now, do you have that agreement?
About dissolving our partnership?

37:08.226 --> 37:09.977
I do. It's right over here.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.563
Good. Did you sign it?

37:12.647 --> 37:15.441
I did.
And I must say it was very generous.

37:16.400 --> 37:17.235
I thought so.

37:20.613 --> 37:21.656
Dramatic, huh?

37:21.739 --> 37:24.200
-What did you do that for?
-I had time to think.

37:24.283 --> 37:28.955
I must remember to lie on a sofa for days
more often. Really clears the head.

37:29.455 --> 37:30.873
You see that?

37:30.957 --> 37:32.416
That's not an obstacle.

37:33.167 --> 37:35.920
It's an opportunity.
So what if we have to delay the build?

37:36.003 --> 37:38.839
Think of the advantages.
Look, I've planned it all out.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.843
Okay. So we move the hotel
to the next lot over.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.679
I bought that this morning.

37:44.762 --> 37:47.431
And on the old lot,
we build a museum that houses the ship

37:47.515 --> 37:51.269
and all of the artifacts they found,
turn it into an event. It's a win-win.

37:51.352 --> 37:53.437
-That's a great idea.
-Isn't it?

37:53.521 --> 37:57.358
I got it from watching your family.
You guys have so much stuff going on.

37:57.441 --> 38:00.236
Wedding, business troubles,
Megan with her art thing,

38:00.319 --> 38:03.364
Caitlyn with her life crisis,
Jay with his guitar playing.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.408
He's in love with you.
You know that, right?

38:05.491 --> 38:08.828
Nell with her date,
which went very well, by the way.

38:08.911 --> 38:11.664
-Wait, how do you know all this?
-From lying on the sofa.

38:11.747 --> 38:13.499
You think I was napping and playing games?

38:13.582 --> 38:16.585
-It looked like that.
-I observe. I take things in.

38:16.669 --> 38:19.005
I thought,
if the O'Briens can do all that,

38:19.088 --> 38:22.008
I can surely build a hotel
that's also a home for a ship.

38:22.383 --> 38:25.177
Wow. Well, I'm glad we could help.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.681
The car is packed
and the plane is ready, sir.

38:28.764 --> 38:31.642
Well, cancel the plane,
drive to the house, and unpack.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.895
We're staying in Chesapeake Shores.
Be seeing you.

38:37.273 --> 38:38.399
Uh...

38:39.483 --> 38:40.484
Thank you, Abby.

38:45.031 --> 38:45.865
Where's Evan?

38:46.824 --> 38:50.202
Uh, he's gone. Sort of.

38:50.286 --> 38:52.538
It's a long story.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.373
-I have time.
-[cell phone rings]

38:54.457 --> 38:57.960
Oh. Hold on. Hey, Kevin, what's up?

38:59.503 --> 39:03.049
We'll be right there.
Sarah. There's been an accident.

39:10.306 --> 39:13.559
-Kevin. How is she?
-We don't know anything yet.

39:14.226 --> 39:16.270
-She's gonna be all right, Kev.
-[doctor] Mr. O'Brien?

39:16.354 --> 39:17.480
Yeah?

39:17.563 --> 39:20.649
-Your wife is fine. She's asking for you.
-[Megan] Thank you.

39:23.152 --> 39:25.071
-Hey. What a relief.
-Yeah.

39:29.283 --> 39:30.326
Hey.

39:31.118 --> 39:31.952
Hey.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.121
I'm so embarrassed.

39:34.205 --> 39:37.208
-Embarrassed?
-The doctor should be here any minute.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.046
I love you.

39:42.129 --> 39:45.883
I love you too, but... I can't believe it.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.677
I risk my life in fires every day

39:48.761 --> 39:51.597
and I fall off a stupid ladder
fixing a stupid banner?

39:51.680 --> 39:53.849
-Could happen to anyone.
-Yeah, but it happened to me.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.228
It was supposed to be me.
Ramirez asked me first.

39:58.187 --> 40:02.149
You know what? You wouldn't
have gotten dizzy and lost your footing.

40:03.067 --> 40:06.237
-I don't know what happened.
-Whoa. Hey, what are you doing?

40:06.987 --> 40:10.491
-Going home. I hate hospitals.
-Wait, no. Sarah, you can't just leave.

40:10.574 --> 40:14.078
-They have to tell you that you can go.
-I can check myself out.

40:14.161 --> 40:18.999
-They have to make sure that you're okay.
-I know that I'm okay. See? I'm okay.

40:21.377 --> 40:24.130
Whoa. Hey. Come here.

40:24.213 --> 40:25.589
Come here. Have a seat.

40:25.673 --> 40:27.007
Come on, get back in.

40:27.883 --> 40:28.717
It's okay.

40:30.761 --> 40:32.721
God, I hate hospitals.

40:32.805 --> 40:36.517
So do I. Awful places.
I wouldn't be here if I didn't work here.

40:37.226 --> 40:40.771
You, Sarah O'Brien, are free to go.
You're in sound health.

40:40.855 --> 40:43.274
A few contusions, but no broken bones.

40:43.357 --> 40:45.901
You have to take it easy
for the next few days.

40:45.985 --> 40:49.530
-But I don't need to tell you that.
-I'm feeling a little woozy still.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.158
Looking at your blood work,
that's understandable.

40:52.241 --> 40:55.161
But rest assured,
there are no complications.

40:55.244 --> 40:56.579
How far along are you?

40:59.957 --> 41:03.627
Judging from your blank expressions,
I guess I'm the first to tell you.

41:04.253 --> 41:06.297
Congratulations. You're pregnant.

-[narrator] Next on Chesapeake Shores:
-Was there ever anything between you two?

44:07.269 --> 44:09.271
-I guess we haven't had that talk yet.
-What talk?

44:09.355 --> 44:11.523
What happened
during the time we were apart.

44:11.607 --> 44:14.652
-What I said has nothing to do with Luke.
-Did you know he got out of prison?

44:14.735 --> 44:16.737
There's nothing going on
with me and Evan Kincaid.

44:16.820 --> 44:19.281
-This is a classic move.
-The whisk away.

44:19.365 --> 44:20.366
The whisk away?

44:20.449 --> 44:24.870
-He whisks you away to some romantic spot.
-Did you do it?

44:24.953 --> 44:26.205
-I did.
-Why didn't you tell me?

44:26.288 --> 44:28.999
I didn't want you to look at me
the way you're looking at me right now.
