WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:05.076
(Derek) THE HUMAN LIFE
IS MADE UP OF CHOICES--

00:05.076 --> 00:07.378
YES OR NO, IN OR OUT,
UP OR DOWN.

00:07.378 --> 00:09.640
AND THEN THERE ARE
THE CHOICES THAT MATTER...
(gunshot)

00:09.640 --> 00:11.512
TO LOVE OR HATE...

00:11.512 --> 00:14.185
TO BE A HERO
OR TO BE A COWARD...

00:14.185 --> 00:16.187
TO FIGHT OR TO GIVE IN...

00:16.187 --> 00:18.149
TO LIVE...

00:18.149 --> 00:21.622
OR DIE.

00:21.622 --> 00:24.625
(gasping)

00:24.625 --> 00:28.559
(sirens wailing)

00:28.559 --> 00:30.631
(sobs)

00:30.631 --> 00:33.164
(panting)

00:33.164 --> 00:34.465
(Derek gasps)

00:34.465 --> 00:36.107
(voice breaking) MY NAME...

00:36.107 --> 00:39.310
MY NAME IS APRIL KEPNER.
I'M 28 YEARS OLD. I...

00:39.310 --> 00:42.073
I WAS BORN ON APRIL 23
IN O--IN OHIO.

00:42.073 --> 00:44.775
I'M FROM COLUMBUS, OHIO.

00:44.775 --> 00:46.777
UM... MY MOM--MY MOM
IS A TEACHER,

00:46.777 --> 00:49.820
AND M-MY DAD IS A FARMER--

00:49.820 --> 00:52.052
C-CORN--
HE--HE--HE GROWS CORN.

00:52.052 --> 00:55.726
THEIR--THEIR NAMES
ARE KAREN AND JOE.

00:55.726 --> 00:58.459
I HAVE THREE SISTERS.
LIBBY'S THE OLDEST.

00:58.459 --> 01:01.232
I'M--I'M NEXT, AND THEN
THERE'S K-KIMMIE, THEN ALICE.

01:01.232 --> 01:03.394
I-I-I-I HAVEN'T
DON'T ANYTHING YET.

01:03.394 --> 01:07.098
I HAVEN'T...
I'VE BARELY LIVED.

01:07.098 --> 01:09.270
I--I'M NOT FINISHED YET.
NO ONE'S LOVED ME YET.

01:09.270 --> 01:11.242
PLEASE. PLEASE.

01:11.242 --> 01:13.304
I'M SOMEONE'S CHILD.

01:13.304 --> 01:15.546
I'M A PERSON.

01:15.546 --> 01:19.150
(Derek coughs)
I'M A PERSON. (whimpers)

01:19.150 --> 01:20.111
(whimpers)

01:20.111 --> 01:21.382
RUN.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.414
(grunts)

01:23.414 --> 01:25.156
(cries)

01:25.156 --> 01:27.258
(door opens)

01:27.258 --> 01:28.759
(Derek grunts)

01:28.759 --> 01:30.721
OH, MR. CLARK...

01:30.721 --> 01:32.793
MR. CLARK...

01:34.695 --> 01:36.197
(door opens)

01:36.197 --> 01:38.199
LIVE OR DIE...

01:38.199 --> 01:40.271
(gasping)

01:40.271 --> 01:43.704
THAT'S THE IMPORTANT CHOICE.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.776
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS
IN OUR HANDS.

01:45.776 --> 01:47.738
(groans)

01:47.738 --> 01:49.640
(Meredith crying)
DEREK COULD STILL BE ALIVE.
(Cristina) WE COULD GET SHOT.

01:49.640 --> 01:52.213
I'M GOING, CRISTINA.
I AM GOING--
NO, NO, NO, NO, YOU ARE NOT.

01:52.213 --> 01:55.386
PLEASE.
YOU'LL GET KILLED, AND I'M NOT
GONNA LET THAT HAPPEN.

01:55.386 --> 01:58.789
YOU WANT TO GO,
YOU GOTTA GO THROUGH ME.

01:58.789 --> 02:01.352
(grunts)

02:01.352 --> 02:03.524
(Teddy) WE MADE IT ALL THE WAY
HOME FROM IRAQ ALIVE,

02:03.524 --> 02:06.457
AND NOW THERE'S THIS GUY WITH
HIS PEOPLE-SHOOTING HAT ON

02:06.457 --> 02:08.659
RIGHT IN HERE IN A HOSPITAL,
WHICH IS ARGUABLY

02:08.659 --> 02:10.631
THE SAFEST PLACE
IN THE WORLD.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.533
IS THERE A POINT
TO THIS OR...
I THINK YOU LOVE ME.

02:12.533 --> 02:15.636
I THINK YOU LOVE CRISTINA
AND I THINK YOU LOVE ME, TOO.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.639
AND I THINK THAT YOU TRIED TO
GET SHEPHERD TO GET RID OF ME

02:18.639 --> 02:20.841
SO THAT YOU WOULDN'T
HAVE TO CHOOSE,

02:20.841 --> 02:24.144
BUT PEOPLE-SHOOTING-HAT GUY
IS HERE, AND, OWEN, FOR MY SAKE

02:24.144 --> 02:27.348
AND FOR CRISTINA'S SAKE,
YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE. HER OR ME?
FINE. NO ONE.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.320
NO ONE.
I'M CHOOSING NO ONE.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.923
I'M TAKING MYSELF OUT OF
THIS EQUATION, AND I AM...

02:37.588 --> 02:39.830
(Teddy) OH, MY GOD.

02:39.830 --> 02:42.463
HE'S DEAD.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.465
WE CAN'T GO TO THE I.C.U.

02:44.465 --> 02:47.568
WE STAY HERE,
WE'RE SITTING DUCKS.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.341
I'M TAKING
THIS PATIENT OUT OF HERE.
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

02:50.341 --> 02:53.404
9-1-1.
WHY ARE THEY ONLY GETTING
THE CIVILIANS OUT?

02:53.404 --> 02:56.247
WHERE'S THE HOSPITAL STAFF?
THE POLICY
IS TO CLEAR THE VISITORS,

02:56.247 --> 02:59.210
ROOM BY ROOM, FLOOR BY FLOOR,
AND REMOVE THEM BEFORE REMOVING

02:59.210 --> 03:02.383
ANY NONESSENTIAL
HOSPITAL PERSONNEL.
DID THEY GET THE SHOOTER? DO YOU
KNOW WHERE THE SHOOTER IS?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.415
DO YOU KNOW
WHO THE SHOOTER IS?
NO, SIR.

03:04.415 --> 03:07.218
WELL, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?
This is Dr. Owen Hunt
from Seattle Grace Hospital.

03:07.218 --> 03:09.760
We're coming out
with a critical patient.
COMMANDER, I'VE GOT SOUND.

03:09.760 --> 03:11.862
Dr. Callie Torres.
I'm up on peds.

03:11.862 --> 03:14.865
We've got a kid up here
with a ruptured appendix.
Dr. Miranda Bailey.
I'm on five.

03:14.865 --> 03:16.927
(woman) He shot a doctor
in the I.C.U...

03:16.927 --> 03:19.370
(Miranda) There are two
dead security guards--
for no reason, he--

03:19.370 --> 03:22.403
(Mark) This guy--6'1",
graying hair, moustache--

03:22.403 --> 03:24.905
And Dr. Charles Percy's
been shot.
He shot a nurse, and I got
a doctor up here...

03:24.905 --> 03:26.737
Please come.
Karev.

03:26.737 --> 03:28.979
We need help up here.
He's got
a G.S.W. to the chest.

03:28.979 --> 03:31.942
I need a way outta here
if he's gonna make it.
(Cristina) He was looking
for the chief...

03:31.942 --> 03:35.546
(man) We're hiding, but...
three people, they're dead.
specifically the chief,
and he shot him.

03:35.546 --> 03:39.250
He shot Derek Shepherd right
in front of us. We need help.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.622
(crying) HOLD ON, OKAY?
HOLD ON. I LOVE YOU.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.824
PLEASE DON'T DIE.
GET OUTTA HERE, MEREDITH,

03:43.824 --> 03:45.956
BEFORE HE SHOOTS YOU, TOO.
(coughs)

03:45.956 --> 03:48.559
DO NOT DIE!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

03:48.559 --> 03:50.561
I CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT YOU.
I CALLED THE POLICE.

03:50.561 --> 03:52.603
IF YOU DIE, I DIE.
OKAY, GOOD. THEY'RE COMING.

03:52.603 --> 03:55.466
THE POLICE ARE COMING.
M-MER, THEY'RE--THEY'RE NOT--
THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET HERE.

03:55.466 --> 03:57.468
THEY'RE NOT COMING FOR US,
NOT--NOT IN TIME.

03:57.468 --> 03:59.810
OH, GOD, MER. MER--
I PICK YOU. I CHOOSE YOU.

03:59.810 --> 04:02.012
WHAT ARE WE--
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
YOU DON'T GET TO DIE ON ME.

04:02.012 --> 04:04.715
DEREK NEEDS SURGERY, SO I--
NO, YOU STAY AWAKE!

04:04.715 --> 04:07.247
WHAT DO WE DO?
YOU STAY AWAKE!
STAY AWAKE.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.519
DEREK!
(mutters)

04:08.519 --> 04:10.921
DEREK, STAY AWAKE.
STAY AWAKE.
OKAY. OKAY.

04:19.259 --> 04:23.464
APRIL, COME ON. WE'RE TAKING
DEREK DOWN TO THE O.R.

04:23.464 --> 04:27.798
TEDDY, SH-SHE'S IN THE O.R.
SHE CAN SAVE HIM. COME ON.

04:27.798 --> 04:29.970
I SAW ON "OPRAH" OR SOMEWHERE
THAT IF YOU TELL THEM

04:29.970 --> 04:33.544
PERSONAL DETAILS ABOUT YOURSELF,
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO KILL YOU.

04:33.544 --> 04:35.976
KEPNER, GET UP.
COME ON. COME ON.
OH.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.879
GET UP. FOLLOW ME.
JUST FOLLOW ME.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.482
YOU GOTTA
EAT MORE... BACON.

04:41.482 --> 04:42.983
WHAT?

04:42.983 --> 04:44.985
YOU STOP YOURSELF FROM DOING
A LOT OF CRAP

04:44.985 --> 04:47.057
THAT YOU WANT TO DO
IN LIFE.

04:47.057 --> 04:49.560
I MEAN,
I'M PROBABLY DYING NOW,

04:49.560 --> 04:52.563
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
YOU GOTTA EAT MORE BACON,

04:52.563 --> 04:53.994
HAVE MORE SEX.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.468
OKAY. I WILL.
I'LL EAT MORE BACON.

04:57.468 --> 04:59.970
BUT YOU GOTTA HANG IN THERE,
'CAUSE SHE'S GONNA BE BACK

04:59.970 --> 05:01.602
ANY MINUTE.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.634
SHE HAD TO GO
TO THE BLOOD BANK AND BACK.

05:11.782 --> 05:15.386
OH, MR. CLARK.

05:15.386 --> 05:18.449
I DIDN'T PLAN TO SHOOT
ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

05:18.449 --> 05:20.090
OF...

05:20.090 --> 05:23.824
OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.
YOU WERE... SAD,

05:23.824 --> 05:27.027
YOU WERE--
YOU WERE GRIEVING.

05:27.027 --> 05:30.931
I ONLY PLANNED TO SHOOT
DR. SHEPHERD.

05:32.663 --> 05:35.335
AND DR. WEBBER.

05:39.069 --> 05:40.941
AND YOU.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.513
(exhales)

05:44.114 --> 05:46.877
YOU UNPLUGGED THE MACHINES.

05:48.949 --> 05:52.483
YOUR HANDS
KILLED MY ALISON.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.789
(inhales sharply)

05:58.789 --> 06:00.791
(gunshot)

06:03.794 --> 06:06.797
(panting)

06:16.076 --> 06:17.648
(mouths words)

06:17.648 --> 06:19.610
(exhales deeply)

06:23.113 --> 06:26.116
(panting)

06:39.470 --> 06:41.832
IS HE DEAD?
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.
VITALS ARE TANKING.

06:41.832 --> 06:43.804
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
I CAN DO FOR HIM.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.106
DON'T DIE.
ALEX, PLEASE DON'T DIE.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.108
(crying)
THIS WAS MY FAULT.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.810
I UNPLUGGED HIS WIFE.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.543
I'M SO SORRY.
THIS WAS MY FAULT.

06:52.543 --> 06:54.885
(sniffles and whispers)
I LOVE YOU.

06:54.885 --> 06:57.417
(crying) DO YOU HEAR ME?

06:57.417 --> 07:00.090
I LOVE YOU.

07:00.090 --> 07:03.093
(Arizona)
NOW YOU'RE GONNA FEEL A POKE,

07:03.093 --> 07:05.425
AND IT'S GONNA HURT,
BUT ONLY FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.057
NO SQUIRMING.
IT HURTS!

07:07.057 --> 07:09.760
OKAY. ALL RIGHT. SQUEEZE
MY HAND. SQUEEZE MY HAND.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.762
TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT.
TIGHT, TIGHT, TIGHT. COME ON.

07:11.762 --> 07:14.735
OH, WOW. YOU'RE STRONG.
(whimpering)

07:18.068 --> 07:20.611
(Ruby whimpering)

07:20.611 --> 07:22.843
THERE ARE ONLY CHILDREN HERE.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.915
(whimpering continues)

07:24.915 --> 07:28.779
THEY SHOT ME.

07:28.779 --> 07:30.981

08:56.106 --> 08:59.139
(Callie) ALL RIGHT. OKAY. I KNOW

08:59.139 --> 09:01.912
AND SHE'S GONNA BE BACK SOON.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:01.912 --> 09:04.915
UNTIL SHE GETS HERE,

09:13.023 --> 09:15.025
YEAH, PEOPLE FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER

09:15.025 --> 09:17.327
AFTER SHE HELPS THEM.

09:17.327 --> 09:19.029
SOMETIMES PEOPLE FEEL BETTER

09:19.029 --> 09:21.131
JUST AFTER
SHE WALKS IN THE ROOM,

09:21.131 --> 09:26.196
'CAUSE SHE HAS GOT THIS...
SUPER-MAGIC SMILE.

09:26.196 --> 09:30.070
YEAH, AND WHEN--
WHEN SHE SMILES AT YOU,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.973
EVERYTHING GETS BETTER.

09:32.973 --> 09:34.845
YOU DON'T KNOW IT,

09:34.845 --> 09:37.007
'CAUSE YOU HAVE YOUR BACK
TO HER RIGHT NOW,

09:37.007 --> 09:39.750
BUT SHE IS GIVING YOU...

09:39.750 --> 09:44.184
(whispers) WOW. SHE IS GIVING
YOU HER BEST SUPER-MAGIC SMILE.

09:46.056 --> 09:48.058
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
DR. ROBBINS?

09:50.190 --> 09:51.662
RIGHT.

09:51.662 --> 09:53.764
(sighs)

09:53.764 --> 09:56.096
I AM, RUBY.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.929
I AM. I AM.
OKAY.

09:58.929 --> 10:01.632
(lowered voice)
I GOTTA CALL THE POLICE

10:01.632 --> 10:04.134
AND TELL THEM
WHAT HAPPENED, OKAY?
I'M--I'M GOOD.

10:04.134 --> 10:05.976
(sirens wailing)
I'M GOOD.

10:05.976 --> 10:07.137
ALL RIGHT.

10:07.137 --> 10:09.609
(people shouting indistinctly)

10:09.609 --> 10:12.282
DOES THE NAME GARY CLARK
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU?

10:12.282 --> 10:14.284
YES.

10:14.284 --> 10:16.616
GARY CLARK'S WIFE
WAS A PATIENT HERE.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.188
SHE WAS MY PATIENT.

10:18.188 --> 10:20.290
HE'S--HE'S SUING
THE HOSPITAL. WHY?

10:20.290 --> 10:24.624
(indistinct conversations)

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
MER, YOU, UM, YOU PREP HIM,

10:26.626 --> 10:28.628
AND APRIL AND I
ARE GONNA GO FIND TEDDY.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.630
SHE SHOULD
STILL BE ON THIS FLOOR.
OKAY.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.133
OKAY, EVERYTHING IS GONNA
BE FINE. OKAY, MER? I PROMISE.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.806
OKAY.
OKAY, THEY'RE GOING
TO FIND TEDDY.

10:35.806 --> 10:37.768
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

10:37.768 --> 10:39.639
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.211
KISS ME.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.252
I'M NOT GONNA DIE.
I PROMISE.

10:52.252 --> 10:56.326
GOOD. 'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE
THE WORST BREAKUP EVER.

10:56.326 --> 11:00.030
(laughs and groans)
OH, SORRY, SORRY, SORRY.

11:00.030 --> 11:02.092
(pants)

11:02.092 --> 11:04.394
(Miranda) OH. OH,
THE PACKING ISN'T HOLDING.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.096
(Mary) WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

11:06.096 --> 11:09.369
IT MEANS... I NEED TO
GET HIM TO AN O.R.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.342
SOMEONE IS COMING. SOMEONE
WILL COME, LIKE A-A COP--

11:12.342 --> 11:15.675
NO, WE NEED
TO GET HIM TO AN O.R.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.009
THAT'S HIS LAST CHANCE
IF HE'S GONNA LIVE, OKAY?
H-HOW ARE WE
EVEN GONNA DO THAT?

11:19.009 --> 11:22.212
WE CAN--WE CAN BARELY
HOLD HIM UP ON HIS SIDE.

11:22.212 --> 11:24.214
UH...

11:24.214 --> 11:26.116
(inhales sharply)
THERE. THERE. THERE.

11:26.116 --> 11:27.888
GIVE ME THE SHEET.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.960
(groans)
YEAH, PUT IT OUT.

11:34.965 --> 11:37.127
(whispering)
IT'S CREEPY QUIET DOWN HERE.

11:37.127 --> 11:38.829
(whispering)
HE'S DOWN HERE.

11:38.829 --> 11:41.401
(lowered voice)
NO, HE IS NOT DOWN HERE.

11:41.401 --> 11:43.403
OH, GOD. HE'S DOWN HERE.
HE'S DOWN HERE.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.405
HE'S GONNA COME OUT.
HE'S GONNA SHOOT US.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.078
HE'S GONNA SH--
WILL YOU SHUT UP?

11:48.078 --> 11:50.080
YOU ARE FREAKING ME OUT,
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME

11:50.080 --> 11:52.242
TO BE FREAKED OUT RIGHT NOW.
SORRY.

11:52.242 --> 11:54.745
OKAY, MER IS A MESS, DEREK IS
A MESS, YOU ARE A MESS,

11:54.745 --> 11:57.748
AND I AM IN CHARGE, AND I SAY
THAT NO ONE IS DOWN HERE.

11:57.748 --> 12:00.220
(door opens)
AAH! NO, DON'T SHOOT!
DON'T SHOOT!

12:00.220 --> 12:02.452
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE
WALKING AROUND.

12:02.452 --> 12:04.925
(whispers)
OH, DAMN IT, JACKSON.
IS THAT YOUR BLOOD?
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:04.925 --> 12:07.397
OH, NO, NO, NO, I'M FINE.
UM, GO GET ALTMAN.
ALTMAN'S NOT DOWN HERE.

12:07.397 --> 12:09.860
GO GET HUNT THEN.
THEY LEFT.

12:09.860 --> 12:11.401
(normal voice) WHAT--
THEY LEFT?

12:11.401 --> 12:13.834
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
SOMEONE JUST SHOT DEREK.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.836
HE'S GOT
A G.S.W. TO THE CHEST,

12:15.836 --> 12:17.838
AND HE NEEDS SURGERY
RIGHT NOW.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.410
TELL ME THERE'S AN ATTENDING
ON THIS FLOOR.

12:23.774 --> 12:26.777
APRIL, IN THE O.R. BEHIND ME,
THERE ARE TWO O.R. NURSES

12:26.777 --> 12:28.819
AND AN ANESTHESIOLOGIST.
GET 'EM.

12:28.819 --> 12:32.152
TELL 'EM TO SET UP
FOR A CARDIAC PROCEDURE.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.523
WHAT--WHAT--WHY?

12:33.523 --> 12:36.156
IF WE DON'T HAVE A SURGEON,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

12:36.156 --> 12:38.128
WE HAVE A SURGEON.

12:38.128 --> 12:40.460
(scoffs) WHO'S GONNA OPERATE
ON DR. SHEPHERD?

12:42.793 --> 12:44.965
I AM.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.798
(inhales deeply)

12:59.479 --> 13:01.011
(exhales)

13:01.011 --> 13:04.254
YOU CAN DO THIS, RIGHT?
YOU'RE SURE?

13:04.254 --> 13:07.087
EVERY G.S.W. IS DIFFERENT.
OKAY? IT'S NOT A BLUEPRINT.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.159
IT'S HALF INSTINCT
AND HALF IMPROV,

13:09.159 --> 13:13.363
AND... I'M VERY GOOD.

13:13.363 --> 13:16.366
FOR A RESIDENT,
I'M VERY GOOD.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.032
YOU CAN'T BE IN THERE.

13:22.032 --> 13:25.035
I CAN'T DO THIS IF YOU'RE
IN THERE STARING AT ME

13:25.035 --> 13:27.807
WITH BIG, SAD
"DON'T KILL McDREAMY" EYES.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.209
WE'RE READY FOR YOU.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.511
APRIL...

13:31.511 --> 13:34.945
MEREDITH IS GONNA SIT HERE
ON THE FLOOR.

13:34.945 --> 13:36.286
I WANT YOU TO STAY WITH HER.

13:36.286 --> 13:38.889
IF SHE TRIES TO ENTER MY O.R.

13:38.889 --> 13:40.891
OR EVEN IF SHE LOOKS LIKE
SHE'S GONNA GET UP

13:40.891 --> 13:43.293
TO TAKE A PEEK,
I WANT YOU TO STOP HER, OKAY?

13:43.293 --> 13:45.295
I DON'T CARE HOW.
YOU STOP HER.

13:45.295 --> 13:48.198
OKAY.
HE IS MY HUSBAND.

13:48.198 --> 13:51.831
DO YOU WANT ME TO KILL HIM?
OKAY? IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

13:59.539 --> 14:03.874
I WILL DO MY VERY BEST WORK.

14:03.874 --> 14:06.446
BUT PLEASE, MEREDITH,
I AM BEGGING YOU,

14:06.446 --> 14:09.449
SIT DOWN AND WAIT.

14:19.059 --> 14:22.132
(blows air)

14:22.132 --> 14:24.895
(sniffles)

14:31.641 --> 14:34.144
IZZIE?

14:34.144 --> 14:37.047
ALEX...

14:37.047 --> 14:39.049
IT'S LEXIE. ALEX.

14:39.049 --> 14:43.253
IZ... I'M SORRY.

14:43.253 --> 14:45.585
DON'T GO.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.958
WE GOT MARRIED.

14:47.958 --> 14:50.220
PLEASE DON'T GO.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.662
(crying)
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

14:52.662 --> 14:56.366
YOU CAME BACK FOR ME, IZ.

14:56.366 --> 14:59.499
I CAME BACK.

14:59.499 --> 15:02.902
DON'T EVER LEAVE ME.

15:02.902 --> 15:04.904
DON'T EVER LEAVE ME AGAIN.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.906
I WON'T.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.109
I WON'T EVER LEAVE YOU.

15:09.109 --> 15:11.511
WE'RE ALWAYS
GONNA BE TOGETHER, OKAY?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.043
ALWAYS.

15:13.043 --> 15:15.145
YEAH.

15:15.145 --> 15:16.446
(door opens)

15:16.446 --> 15:18.388
(Lexie gasps)

15:18.388 --> 15:20.220
THIS FLOOR IS CLEAR.

15:20.220 --> 15:24.054
WE'RE GOING TO
EVACUATE YOU NOW.
(exhales deeply)

15:24.054 --> 15:27.627
WE'VE CLEARED ONE FLOOR.
WE'LL CLEAR THE OTHERS.
YOU'VE GOT FIVE GUYS

15:27.627 --> 15:30.160
SEARCHING 150,000 SQUARE FEET
OF HOSPITAL--
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

15:30.160 --> 15:32.632
DON'T WORRY.
HE'S NOT GETTING OUTTA THERE.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.304
CASEY.
YES, SIR.

15:34.304 --> 15:36.306
PULL A D.M.V. PHOTO
OF GARY CLARK.

15:36.306 --> 15:38.568
HAVE DR. WEBBER CONFIRM.
AND SHUT DOWN THE ELEVATORS.

15:38.568 --> 15:40.570
WE WANT TO ISOLATE THIS GUY,
ALL RIGHT?

15:40.570 --> 15:44.074
WHERE CAN I FIND
DR. WEBBER?
WELL, HE'S RIGHT OVER...

15:44.074 --> 15:48.218
(indistinct conversations)

15:48.218 --> 15:50.620
OKAY, WE GOT A G.S.W.
STRAIGHT FROM THE O.R.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.322
STILL CRITICAL.

15:52.322 --> 15:55.255
LET'S GET HIM
TO THE PARAMEDICS.
YOU GOT HIM?

15:55.255 --> 15:58.128
HAVE YOU GOTTEN THE SHOOTER?
I NEED TO CLEAR YOU TWO.

15:58.128 --> 16:01.191
HAVE YOU GOTTEN
THE DOCTORS OUT?
NO, SIR.
THIS IS A SECURE AREA.

16:01.191 --> 16:04.194
I'M GONNA NEED TO
MOVE YOU OVER TO HOLDING.

16:04.194 --> 16:05.595
(siren wailing)

16:05.595 --> 16:08.198
SHE'S STILL IN THERE.

16:08.198 --> 16:10.300
(whispers) TEDDY...

16:10.300 --> 16:12.672
GO.

16:12.672 --> 16:15.305
IT'S OKAY.

16:15.305 --> 16:18.378
IT'S OKAY TO CHOOSE.

16:18.378 --> 16:22.352
(indistinct conversations)

16:22.352 --> 16:25.155
(siren wailing)

16:25.155 --> 16:28.218
SIR, YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED--
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO--SIR!

16:28.218 --> 16:30.060
COME BACK NOW!

16:43.433 --> 16:45.175
(crying)

16:45.175 --> 16:47.607
STOP CRYING.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.209
(sniffles)

16:49.209 --> 16:54.244
LOOK, IT TOOK ME
A LONG TIME TO FIND HIM,

16:54.244 --> 16:57.317
A LONG TIME.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.320
AND EVEN THEN,
IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME

17:00.320 --> 17:03.053
TO EVEN KNOW
THAT I WANTED HIM--

17:03.053 --> 17:07.427
TO BE MARRIED, TO BE HIS WIFE,
TO HAVE HIS KIDS.

17:07.427 --> 17:09.429
AND NOW
THAT I REALIZE THAT...

17:09.429 --> 17:12.432
(voice breaking)
HE'S LYING ON A TABLE IN THERE

17:12.432 --> 17:17.067
AND MY BEST FRIEND'S HANDS
ARE INSIDE HIS CHEST.

17:17.067 --> 17:21.311
YOU DON'T GET TO CRY
ABOUT THAT.

17:23.613 --> 17:26.246
(sniffles)

17:31.281 --> 17:34.654
REED WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

17:34.654 --> 17:37.127
SHE DIED TODAY.

17:37.127 --> 17:40.730
(sniffles)

17:58.748 --> 18:00.310
G.S.W. TO THE RIGHT CHEST.

18:00.310 --> 18:03.383
WE PUT IN A CHEST TUBE.
HE'S GOT 3 LITERS OF L.R.,

18:03.383 --> 18:06.085
AND TWO UNITS OF PACKED CELLS.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIM
INTO THE AMBULANCE.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.389
CALL SEATTLE PRES AND LET 'EM
KNOW THAT WE'RE COMING.
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY...

18:09.389 --> 18:10.820
RIGHT?

18:10.820 --> 18:12.722
(indistinct conversations)

18:12.722 --> 18:14.364
(Jackson)
CAN YOU FEEL ANYTHING?

18:14.364 --> 18:16.366
CAN YOU SEE WHERE
THE BLOOD'S COMING FROM?
NOT YET.

18:16.366 --> 18:19.199
DAMN IT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.132
GIVE ME SOME SUCTION.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
(suction gurgling)

18:22.132 --> 18:24.534
IT'S RIGHT BY THE AORTA.

18:24.534 --> 18:27.537
YOU CAN DO THIS.
I KNOW THAT. I JUST
WANTED IT TO BE EASY,

18:27.537 --> 18:31.811
NOT THE HARDEST FREAKING REPAIR
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.313
(gurgling continues)

18:33.313 --> 18:36.446
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

18:36.446 --> 18:39.219
THERE'S MASSIVE BLEEDING
IN THE LUNGS,

18:39.219 --> 18:41.721
THERE IS A BULLET LODGED
RIGHT NEXT TO THE AORTA

18:41.721 --> 18:43.723
AND A HUGE HEMATOMA.

18:43.723 --> 18:46.496
WOULD TEDDY USE A GRAFT
OR CLAMP AND SEW?
I THINK SHE'D--

18:46.496 --> 18:48.898
(exhales) PIG OR COW?
WHAT?

18:48.898 --> 18:50.560
PIG OR COW, CRISTINA?

18:50.560 --> 18:53.533
(gurgling continues)

18:53.533 --> 18:56.236
CLAMP AND SEW.
DEFINITELY CLAMP AND SEW.

18:56.236 --> 18:58.508
GIVE ME A CLAMP.

18:58.508 --> 19:00.410
BADASS.

19:00.410 --> 19:02.772
(Mary) HOW MUCH FURTHER?
(Miranda) WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

19:02.772 --> 19:04.774
WE'RE GONNA GET HIM
ON THE ELEVATOR,

19:04.774 --> 19:08.818
AND THEN WE'LL BE
RIGHT AT THE O.R. FLOOR.

19:08.818 --> 19:11.281
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

19:11.281 --> 19:13.753
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.
OKAY, CHARLES?

19:13.753 --> 19:16.856
WE'RE ALMOST THERE?
YEAH.
JUST A FEW MORE MINUTES.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.588
(sniffles)

19:18.588 --> 19:21.291
(Miranda mutters)

19:21.291 --> 19:24.264
DR. B.?

19:24.264 --> 19:27.267
(labored breathing)

19:29.369 --> 19:31.371
THERE'S A HUM...

19:31.371 --> 19:32.772
ELEVATORS MAKE
WHEN THEY'RE ON.

19:32.772 --> 19:35.245
THERE'S A HUM.

19:35.245 --> 19:37.307
THERE'S NO HUM.

19:37.307 --> 19:38.878
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:38.878 --> 19:41.951
IT MEANS
THE ELEVATORS...

19:41.951 --> 19:45.615
THEY'RE OFF.

19:45.615 --> 19:48.458
THE ELEVATORS AREN'T WORKING!

19:48.458 --> 19:50.460
THE ELEVATORS AREN'T WORKING!

19:50.460 --> 19:53.893
WE NEED TO GET TO THE O.R.!
SHH. PLEASE, STOP YELLING.

19:53.893 --> 19:56.896

33:04.083 --> 33:06.385
(chuckles) IT WAS--
IT WAS ON SALE.

33:06.385 --> 33:09.018
AND THEN THIS MORNING...

33:09.018 --> 33:13.522
I WAS PACKING IT
INTO MY COAT.

33:13.522 --> 33:18.497
I DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM
FOR ALL OF IT IN MY POCKETS...

33:18.497 --> 33:20.429
BECAUSE...

33:24.473 --> 33:26.775
I WANTED TO BRING MY FLASK.

33:31.640 --> 33:34.383
YOU MIND?

33:37.686 --> 33:40.289
(grunts)

33:50.159 --> 33:54.063
(cap rattles)

33:59.238 --> 34:01.470
(grunts)

34:16.355 --> 34:18.687
I'M NOT MUCH OF A DRINKER.

34:20.359 --> 34:23.162
BUT I FIGURED I'D NEED
SOME LIQUID COURAGE.

34:28.737 --> 34:30.569
YOU WANT SOME?

34:35.073 --> 34:37.546
NO, THANKS.

34:43.552 --> 34:46.315
(laughs)

34:46.315 --> 34:48.557
THE FUNNY PART IS...

34:48.557 --> 34:51.360
I DIDN'T NEED A DRINK
UNTIL NOW--

34:51.360 --> 34:54.123
RIGHT NOW.

34:54.123 --> 34:56.125
AND THE ONLY REASON
I NEED A DRINK

34:56.125 --> 34:58.527
IS BECAUSE...

34:58.527 --> 35:01.630
I ONLY HAVE ONE BULLET LEFT.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.232
(laughs)

35:03.232 --> 35:04.733
I LEFT BULLETS AT HOME

35:04.733 --> 35:07.436
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I'D NEED A DRINK.

35:07.436 --> 35:09.738
AND THE ONLY REASON
I NEED A DRINKIS BECAUSE...

35:09.738 --> 35:11.740
I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH BULLETS.

35:11.740 --> 35:14.743
(laughs)

35:18.417 --> 35:20.489
SEE, I WAS GONNA KILL YOU...

35:20.489 --> 35:23.792
SHOOT YOU RIGHT IN THE FACE...

35:23.792 --> 35:28.557
WATCH YOU SUFFER AND DIE.

35:28.557 --> 35:32.261
AND THEN I WAS GONNA
SHOOT MYSELF.

35:34.563 --> 35:37.336
BUT I ONLY HAVE
ONE BULLET LEFT.

35:40.509 --> 35:43.572
THEN IT SEEMS,
YOU HAVE A BIT OF A PROBLEM.

35:45.514 --> 35:47.476
I DO.

35:47.476 --> 35:49.818
I DO.

35:49.818 --> 35:52.921
I HAVE
ONE HELL OF A PROBLEM.

35:55.754 --> 35:58.887
YOU SURE
YOU DON'T WANT A DRINK?

36:12.641 --> 36:14.943
VODKA.

36:14.943 --> 36:17.346
THAT'S NICE.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.356
HEY.

36:27.356 --> 36:30.359
(vodka splattering on floor)

36:30.359 --> 36:32.721
WHAT'S IT GONNA BE,
MR. CLARK?

36:34.463 --> 36:36.565
ME OR YOU?

36:38.196 --> 36:39.498
(flask thuds)

36:39.498 --> 36:42.671
YOU SHOOT ME,
S.W.A.T.'s GONNA GET YOU.

36:42.671 --> 36:45.203
AND THEY'RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT YOU.

36:45.203 --> 36:46.505
THEY'RE GONNA CAPTURE YOU

36:46.505 --> 36:48.507
AND THEY'RE GONNA
TAKE YOU TO PRISON.

36:48.507 --> 36:51.240
OR YOU SHOOT YOURSELF...

36:51.240 --> 36:52.681
THEN YOU'RE FREE...

36:52.681 --> 36:54.383
DONE...

36:54.383 --> 36:57.616
MAYBE GET TO SEE
YOUR WIFE AGAIN.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.749
SO YOU HAVE
A CHOICE TO MAKE.

37:00.749 --> 37:02.851
ME OR YOU?

37:02.851 --> 37:06.525
A LIFE IN PRISON...

37:06.525 --> 37:10.529
OR AN AFTERLIFE
WITH YOUR WIFE?

37:11.960 --> 37:14.232
S-SCREW YOU.

37:14.232 --> 37:15.534
SEE, I'VE LIVED.

37:15.534 --> 37:19.368
I MEAN, I'VE REALLY,
REALLY LIVED.

37:19.368 --> 37:21.370
I'VE FAILED...

37:21.370 --> 37:23.912
I'VE BEEN DEVASTATED,
I'VE BEEN BROKEN...

37:23.912 --> 37:26.715
I'VE GONE TO HELL AND BACK.

37:26.715 --> 37:29.518
AND I'VE ALSO KNOWN JOY...

37:29.518 --> 37:32.381
AND PASSION.

37:32.381 --> 37:34.483
AND I'VE HAD A GREAT LOVE.

37:36.355 --> 37:38.457
SEE...

37:38.457 --> 37:40.559
DEATH FOR ME...

37:40.559 --> 37:43.592
IS NOT JUSTICE.

37:43.592 --> 37:47.836
IT'S AN... END
OF A BEAUTIFUL JOURNEY.

37:50.539 --> 37:54.343
AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO DIE.

37:54.343 --> 37:56.875
THE QUESTION IS...

37:56.875 --> 37:59.378
ARE YOU?

37:59.378 --> 38:02.381
A LIFE IN PRISON...

38:02.381 --> 38:05.053
OR AN AFTERLIFE...

38:05.053 --> 38:08.016
