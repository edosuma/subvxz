00:09.741 --> 00:12.309
The wind blows
wherever it wants.

00:12.311 --> 00:13.943
You can hear it,

00:13.946 --> 00:18.381
but cannot tell where it comes
from or where it is going.

00:18.383 --> 00:22.521
Just as you cannot explain how
people are born of the spirit.

01:02.560 --> 01:03.893
Wait.

01:03.895 --> 01:05.528
What?

01:05.530 --> 01:07.697
Where are the keys?

01:07.699 --> 01:09.636
Babe, remember,
I have them.

01:11.270 --> 01:12.668
Just because you wouldn't
let me drive

01:12.670 --> 01:15.004
doesn't mean I can't
at least open the door.

01:15.006 --> 01:17.340
Are you okay?

01:17.342 --> 01:18.877
Shh!

01:28.520 --> 01:30.490
Shh!

01:32.357 --> 01:35.494
Congratulations, you passed
the "key in the lock" challenge.

01:45.970 --> 01:47.673
I see.

01:54.712 --> 01:56.515
Guys, no.

01:58.750 --> 02:02.385
So how's our mood?

02:02.387 --> 02:03.519
I am always in the mood.

02:03.521 --> 02:04.920
I know you are...

02:04.922 --> 02:07.593
Are you kidding me?
Gross.

03:26.972 --> 03:28.841
Mama.

03:34.446 --> 03:35.815
Hey.

03:36.914 --> 03:38.614
Did you hear that?

03:38.616 --> 03:40.149
What?

03:40.151 --> 03:41.885
I heard something.

03:41.887 --> 03:44.357
Like what?

03:46.424 --> 03:48.492
What'd you hear?

03:48.494 --> 03:52.365
Like Lucy,
but not Lucy.

03:59.471 --> 04:01.607
Maybe I didn't hear
anything.

04:02.507 --> 04:04.840
Was it a dream?

04:04.842 --> 04:06.475
Yeah.

04:06.477 --> 04:08.647
Yeah, maybe.

04:14.186 --> 04:17.423
No, I don't think so.

06:31.689 --> 06:33.590
I don't want to die.

06:33.592 --> 06:35.794
It's not time
for me to die.

06:39.931 --> 06:42.001
You got to be kidding me.

06:52.311 --> 06:54.947
Hey, Mom, Dad!

07:13.097 --> 07:16.833
I told you I was going through
some hard times in business.

07:16.835 --> 07:18.735
A rough patch.

07:18.737 --> 07:21.136
Mom has a job.
We don't have to move.

07:21.138 --> 07:23.138
I love the thought sweetie,

07:23.140 --> 07:25.609
but being a writer
doesn't mean I have a job

07:25.611 --> 07:27.744
unless somebody
buys my writing.

07:27.746 --> 07:29.980
It's kind of like putting
a "for sale" sign out front.

07:29.982 --> 07:32.247
I mean, it doesn't mean
anything's sold

07:32.249 --> 07:34.350
until somebody
wants to buy it.

07:34.352 --> 07:37.086
We're just keeping
our options open.

07:37.088 --> 07:38.687
This is where we live.

07:38.689 --> 07:40.624
You can't sell it
for that reason alone.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.759
Well, someone would have to make
a really good offer

07:43.761 --> 07:46.396
before we'd even consider
saying yes.

07:46.398 --> 07:51.768
Now, the people who built this
house back in 1800-something,

07:51.770 --> 07:53.335
they built it
for themselves.

07:53.337 --> 07:55.405
They never planned on anybody
else living here.

07:55.407 --> 07:57.273
What's that supposed to mean?

07:57.275 --> 08:02.048
Well, this house, it's not meant
for anyone in particular.

08:04.015 --> 08:06.383
We'll be here for a short while,
just like the people before us.

08:06.385 --> 08:08.751
And we certainly won't
be the last ones to live here.

08:08.753 --> 08:10.386
Not the way
this place was made.

08:10.388 --> 08:13.256
You don't get it.
This is my home.

08:13.258 --> 08:14.994
I live here.

08:18.664 --> 08:20.830
You know, when we first
moved here,

08:20.832 --> 08:24.367
the thought of living in an old
house with an historical vibe,

08:24.369 --> 08:25.934
it was great.

08:25.936 --> 08:29.172
But the maintenance
is never-ending.

08:29.174 --> 08:31.141
The taxes are killing us.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.876
I mean, people
are always outside

08:32.878 --> 08:35.745
like it's some sort
of tourist attraction.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.813
What maintenance?

08:38.816 --> 08:40.817
The plumbing.
I mean, the pipes are ancient.

08:40.818 --> 08:43.352
- The roof.
- The yard.

08:43.354 --> 08:44.853
Grass just keeps
growing and growing,

08:44.855 --> 08:48.824
whether somebody
cuts it or not.

08:48.826 --> 08:50.359
Dad doesn't have a job.
He can cut it.

08:50.361 --> 08:52.828
Plus, winter's coming.
Stuff stops growing.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.329
Problem solved.

08:54.331 --> 08:56.933
The house is a bit big
for a family of three.

08:56.935 --> 08:58.834
I think it's time to let
somebody else live here.

08:58.836 --> 09:01.072
You already
made up your minds!

09:02.173 --> 09:03.942
I hate you guys.

09:07.479 --> 09:09.478
Well, we've talked about this
time and time again.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.282
I know.
Just give her some time.

10:11.976 --> 10:13.977
Oh, really.

10:13.979 --> 10:16.014
Great.

10:18.115 --> 10:20.485
Now?

10:39.537 --> 10:43.405
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

10:43.407 --> 10:47.477
- ♪ Happy birthday, dear Lucy ♪
- ♪ Happy birthday, dear Lucy ♪

10:47.479 --> 10:52.247
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
- ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

10:52.249 --> 10:53.916
All right.

10:53.918 --> 10:56.821
- Happy birthday, sweetie.
- Make a wish.

11:02.060 --> 11:05.064
All right.

11:06.898 --> 11:08.430
Well...

11:08.432 --> 11:10.366
- Well?
- Well, what?

11:10.368 --> 11:11.934
Oh, my goodness.

11:13.238 --> 11:15.070
I forgot the gifts.

11:15.072 --> 11:16.271
Oh, no.

11:16.273 --> 11:17.873
- Yeah.
- Mom?

11:17.875 --> 11:19.608
- Maybe next year, hon.
- Dad?

11:19.610 --> 11:21.077
So not cool.

11:22.880 --> 11:25.014
You know, I think I might
have seen a few things

11:25.016 --> 11:26.882
in the living room.

11:26.884 --> 11:29.484
- Did you see...?
- Oh. Yeah, maybe.

11:29.486 --> 11:30.953
Maybe some sparkles and bows.

11:30.955 --> 11:33.859
- Come on.
- All right, let's go.

11:35.125 --> 11:37.059
Come on, squirt,
give us some credit.

11:37.061 --> 11:39.898
You know how special
birthdays are around here.

11:42.901 --> 11:44.166
All right, I got it.

11:44.168 --> 11:46.135
Yeah, grab a few.

11:47.471 --> 11:49.505
How about this one first?

11:49.507 --> 11:51.306
So, what'd you wish for?

11:51.308 --> 11:52.641
Can't tell you.

11:52.643 --> 11:54.176
- Ugh!
- What?

11:54.178 --> 11:55.377
Can't tell us
or won't tell us?

11:55.379 --> 11:56.578
Yeah.

11:56.580 --> 11:57.881
It's kind of weird.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.452
Okay, well,
happy birthday, anyway.

12:17.435 --> 12:19.138
Hello?

12:21.105 --> 12:23.141
Somebody there?

12:25.976 --> 12:28.179
Oh, man.

12:31.215 --> 12:33.384
No kidding.

12:34.385 --> 12:36.151
Whoa.

12:36.153 --> 12:38.157
Holy...

12:39.691 --> 12:42.094
I mean, how'd that happen?

12:43.161 --> 12:45.093
The usual way.

12:49.133 --> 12:51.467
The party night?

12:51.469 --> 12:53.202
Yeah.

12:53.204 --> 12:56.171
I think our little...
after-party.

12:59.643 --> 13:02.645
You sure?

13:02.647 --> 13:06.649
I mean, as much as I can trust
the little pee sticks.

13:06.651 --> 13:10.222
I'm going to go see Dr. Green
for a follow-up next week.

13:15.593 --> 13:19.328
All right, well,
let's assume it's for real.

13:19.330 --> 13:21.200
What then?

13:23.067 --> 13:28.006
Then it would be
ridiculous.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.110
I mean, right?

14:40.512 --> 14:42.245
I'll be home
a little early tonight.

14:42.247 --> 14:44.179
Jack Simmons is coming over
for a quick drink.

14:44.181 --> 14:46.115
Jack? Really?

14:46.117 --> 14:48.184
What's that about?

14:48.186 --> 14:51.753
He's thinking about teaming up.
Talking about a new start-up.

14:51.755 --> 14:54.823
Isn't he sort of the boy
who cried wolf at this point?

14:54.825 --> 14:56.692
Well, can't argue that he made
the right call

14:56.694 --> 14:58.294
on that pharmaceutical
start-up.

14:58.296 --> 14:59.728
Yeah, but that was then,
wasn't it?

14:59.730 --> 15:01.597
Yeah.

15:01.599 --> 15:03.498
Hey, sweetie, you want to go out
to dinner tonight?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.133
Just you and me?

15:05.135 --> 15:08.170
Jack still has some
of his family money.

15:08.172 --> 15:09.671
Along with my reputation,

15:09.673 --> 15:11.808
I think we can get
even more investments.

15:11.810 --> 15:13.508
What's the concern?

15:13.510 --> 15:15.444
I don't mean to put
the kibosh on anything,

15:15.446 --> 15:21.851
but I just... I don't always
feel comfortable around Jack.

15:21.853 --> 15:24.654
My dad partnered up with a guy
one time who was not,

15:24.656 --> 15:27.423
to say the least,
his style.

15:27.425 --> 15:30.459
But, uh, you know,
sometimes it takes all types

15:30.461 --> 15:32.194
to get it done, right?

15:32.196 --> 15:33.798
I suppose.

15:38.670 --> 15:40.806
This house is haunted.

15:46.277 --> 15:49.145
How so?

15:49.147 --> 15:52.350
Last night in my room,
I just felt I wasn't alone.

15:53.817 --> 15:56.254
Well, are you sure
your iPad was turned off?

15:57.555 --> 16:00.555
Knew I could
count on you, Mom.

16:00.557 --> 16:03.291
You know, the house
is over a hundred years old.

16:03.293 --> 16:04.626
Squeaks and drafts,

16:04.628 --> 16:07.530
kind of comes
with the territory.

16:07.532 --> 16:09.734
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about.

16:11.268 --> 16:14.871
And, you know,
spirits and ghosts...

16:14.873 --> 16:17.376
you know all that's BS, right?

16:19.510 --> 16:23.246
Don't tell me a house like this
doesn't have at least one ghost.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.384
Well, when we bought the house,
the ghost box wasn't checked.

16:27.518 --> 16:29.687
What if this
is a new ghost?

16:31.156 --> 16:32.854
How can a ghost be new?

16:32.856 --> 16:34.457
Like you're an expert
at anything.

16:34.459 --> 16:36.391
Lucy!

17:16.400 --> 17:18.002
Dennis?

17:21.872 --> 17:23.441
Dennis?

17:28.346 --> 17:30.213
Dennis?

17:30.215 --> 17:31.550
Luce?

17:38.822 --> 17:41.757
...heard us say that
we needed to get back on the wagon.

17:41.759 --> 17:43.693
They put us back
on the wagon.

17:43.695 --> 17:45.528
I was like, "What is going on
here, Adam?"

17:45.530 --> 17:47.363
And he's like, "Well, this isn't
a beginner workout.

17:47.365 --> 17:50.301
You're essentially
a beginner right now."

18:13.757 --> 18:15.324
...other documents,

18:15.326 --> 18:16.692
it's time to clean house

18:16.694 --> 18:18.360
in "Smart Woman:
What to Keep, What to Toss."

18:18.362 --> 18:20.498
Someone in our community
will win a few furn...

18:38.315 --> 18:39.684
Oh!

18:42.387 --> 18:44.986
Oh! Oskar!

18:44.988 --> 18:46.722
Oh, sweetheart.

18:46.724 --> 18:48.890
You poor baby.

18:48.892 --> 18:51.394
I'm sorry, buddy.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.565
There you go, buddy.

18:54.666 --> 18:57.502
Oh, good boy.

19:01.539 --> 19:03.342
I'm so sorry.

19:30.400 --> 19:32.068
Honey, will you get that?

19:32.070 --> 19:33.469
Yeah.

19:33.471 --> 19:34.736
Who is that?

19:34.738 --> 19:36.707
Probably Jack.

19:40.011 --> 19:44.079
Wow, look at you.
You are growing up.

19:44.081 --> 19:45.681
What grade are you in now?

19:45.683 --> 19:47.616
- Eighth.
- Eighth grade.

19:47.618 --> 19:50.552
Well, that is a great grade
to be in.

19:50.554 --> 19:51.922
Mm-hmm.

19:53.491 --> 19:55.057
Ah. Hey, Dennis.

19:55.059 --> 19:57.992
Will you take a look
at little missy here, huh?

19:57.994 --> 20:00.061
- Yeah, that's my daughter.
- Mm-hmm.

20:00.063 --> 20:01.996
- Let's go into my study.
- All right.

20:01.998 --> 20:04.500
I was just telling your little
girl how she's all grown up,

20:04.502 --> 20:06.135
right before
our very eyes.

20:06.137 --> 20:09.371
You must be
a very proud papa.

20:09.373 --> 20:10.873
- Scotch?
- Uh, no.

20:10.875 --> 20:14.613
No, I'm on the wagon
for the moment.

20:21.017 --> 20:23.018
Can I have a glass of milk,
please?

20:23.020 --> 20:25.857
And I'll have
a sauvignon blanc.

20:26.757 --> 20:28.057
Oh, wait.

20:28.059 --> 20:29.959
I'm sorry,
um, can I get a...

20:29.961 --> 20:32.027
Can I get a sparkling water
with lime instead?

20:32.029 --> 20:33.596
Thank you.

20:33.598 --> 20:35.798
Don't tell me.
Not another diet.

20:35.800 --> 20:37.668
No, just being careful.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.974
No way.
You're not going to tell me...

20:45.176 --> 20:46.674
What?

20:46.676 --> 20:48.444
Women don't drink
when they're...

20:48.446 --> 20:50.044
Gross! You did it with Dad?

20:50.046 --> 20:51.847
Lucy!

20:51.849 --> 20:53.449
Come on.

20:53.451 --> 20:55.518
How else do you think
that would that work?

20:55.520 --> 20:58.357
Seriously, how?

20:59.490 --> 21:00.489
We'll talk about it later.

21:00.491 --> 21:02.424
No. I took biology.

21:02.426 --> 21:05.627
You get pregnant, which means
you're going to have a baby.

21:05.629 --> 21:07.096
Well, not necessarily.

21:07.098 --> 21:09.063
I mean, for the time being,
at least,

21:09.065 --> 21:10.665
women can still kind of
make up their mind

21:10.667 --> 21:12.201
about that kind of thing.

21:12.203 --> 21:13.972
Oh.

21:20.778 --> 21:24.579
Did you have to make the same
decision before you had me?

21:24.581 --> 21:26.115
No, honey.

21:26.117 --> 21:28.520
No, of course not.

21:29.719 --> 21:31.186
Oh, thank you.

21:31.188 --> 21:32.957
Thank you.

21:35.493 --> 21:37.026
Thanks a lot.

21:37.028 --> 21:40.195
Anyway, this is just
a hypothetical discussion.

21:40.197 --> 21:42.030
So just for fun,

21:42.032 --> 21:46.772
how would you feel about having
a baby brother or sister?

21:48.105 --> 21:50.105
Strange.

21:50.107 --> 21:51.807
Not sure.

21:51.809 --> 21:54.009
It could be kind of cool,
actually.

21:54.011 --> 21:55.610
Yeah? You wouldn't...

21:55.612 --> 21:57.913
You wouldn't feel weird
about being 14

21:57.915 --> 21:59.748
and having a baby sister?

21:59.750 --> 22:03.085
- Is it a girl?
- Hey, not so fast.

22:03.087 --> 22:04.752
I never said
I was pregnant.

22:04.754 --> 22:08.059
It's just a...
just a hypothetical discussion.

22:50.167 --> 22:52.771
I know you're here.

22:53.971 --> 22:56.571
Have you ever felt alone?

22:56.573 --> 23:00.778
So alone that no one even knows
you're alive?

23:19.830 --> 23:23.264
There's something
in my room at night.

23:23.266 --> 23:24.700
Like what?

23:24.702 --> 23:26.769
Not sure. Something.

23:26.771 --> 23:28.069
Does it make any noise?

23:28.071 --> 23:30.007
No. It's just there.

23:31.908 --> 23:33.576
You know...

23:33.578 --> 23:35.877
when I was your age,
I was doing drugs.

23:35.879 --> 23:37.913
- Are you doing drugs?
- Dennis.

23:37.915 --> 23:40.952
Like I can afford drugs
on my allowance?

23:46.756 --> 23:48.292
Then how do you
explain this?

23:51.928 --> 23:54.262
Mm, that's a picture
of your arm.

23:54.264 --> 23:56.665
Yeah, but I didn't
take it.

23:56.667 --> 23:59.667
I'm sure there's
an explanation.

23:59.669 --> 24:02.171
You've heard of a butt dial?
That's a butt photo.

24:03.741 --> 24:05.240
Funny, Dad.

24:05.242 --> 24:07.145
That's funny.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.259
Mama.

28:16.025 --> 28:17.425
May I help you
with something?

28:17.427 --> 28:19.261
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:19.263 --> 28:21.329
I'm Mary Squire.
I'm one of the librarians here.

28:21.331 --> 28:23.065
Are you looking
for something specific,

28:23.067 --> 28:24.532
or just browsing around?

28:24.534 --> 28:26.268
I was actually trying to find
a little history

28:26.270 --> 28:28.236
on some of the houses
around here.

28:28.238 --> 28:30.905
- I live just up the street.
- Here? On Wisconsin Avenue?

28:30.907 --> 28:32.907
- Uh, no, I'm on Forrest.
- Oh, which house?

28:32.909 --> 28:36.043
- The address?
- No, which house?

28:36.045 --> 28:38.614
The Babcock House?
The Hawk's House?

28:38.616 --> 28:41.116
Kimberly. Gilbert.
Shattuck. Buchannan.

28:41.118 --> 28:43.518
Right. I'm in
the Clarkson house.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.087
Okay.

28:45.089 --> 28:46.954
Around here it's better
than an address.

28:46.956 --> 28:49.026
That's how we keep track
of things.

28:51.962 --> 28:53.628
So, what would you
like to know?

28:53.630 --> 28:55.297
I don't know,
I was just wondering

28:55.299 --> 28:56.665
about who lived there
before us.

28:56.667 --> 28:59.268
You know,
what were they like?

28:59.270 --> 29:01.403
Well, I think you're going
to love this room.

29:01.405 --> 29:05.376
This is where we keep all
the files on the historic homes.

29:28.398 --> 29:30.200
Look at this.

29:34.338 --> 29:36.171
Ah.

29:36.173 --> 29:37.505
Yeah, Alexander Clarkson.

29:37.507 --> 29:39.707
He patented
a paper-making process,

29:39.709 --> 29:41.879
and then used it
to mint money.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.280
That's a joke.

29:45.282 --> 29:48.317
The US Mint used his paper
to make dollar bills.

29:48.319 --> 29:50.085
Paper currency.

29:50.087 --> 29:52.453
You know, by the look
of this picture,

29:52.455 --> 29:57.494
maybe they were heading
to Easter services.

29:59.495 --> 30:02.030
I want to know
more about them.

30:02.032 --> 30:05.267
Well, you're welcome
to look at anything.

30:05.269 --> 30:08.537
It's as much your history
as anyone's.

30:08.539 --> 30:10.441
Maybe more.

30:51.048 --> 30:53.080
Everybody hold still, please.

30:53.082 --> 30:56.484
The flowers look beautiful,
Mr. Stein.

30:56.486 --> 30:59.053
Thank you for all
your hard work.

30:59.055 --> 31:00.187
Danke.

31:00.189 --> 31:03.258
May you a very
joyous Easter.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.263
We hope you have
a good Passover.

31:28.185 --> 31:33.155
So he was literally was making
money by... by making money.

31:33.157 --> 31:35.523
Maybe we should start
prying up the floorboards

31:35.525 --> 31:37.192
to see if he left any.

31:37.194 --> 31:38.726
Anyway, there's more.

31:38.728 --> 31:42.063
And I don't know
the cause for it yet,

31:42.065 --> 31:44.232
but there is some sort of...

31:44.234 --> 31:46.068
some sort of sadness here.

31:46.070 --> 31:48.302
Like a melancholy.

31:48.304 --> 31:50.371
A spirit.

31:50.373 --> 31:52.309
Bam. Told you.

31:54.177 --> 31:57.247
Maybe he'd like to split
the mortgage with us.

32:04.154 --> 32:05.486
Stein.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.321
Their last name was Stein.

32:07.323 --> 32:09.523
- Who?
- Their servants.

32:09.525 --> 32:13.194
The Clarksons.

32:13.196 --> 32:15.496
And where
did you see this?

32:15.498 --> 32:19.267
Uh, I can't say.

32:19.269 --> 32:21.203
I've been all through this.

32:21.205 --> 32:24.772
I couldn't find any record
of the Clarkson's domestic help.

32:24.774 --> 32:27.776
I mean, the servant family
would have lived with them,

32:27.778 --> 32:30.779
but not necessarily
put down the same roots.

32:30.781 --> 32:32.880
They were kind of more
in the shadows,

32:32.882 --> 32:36.818
and those records,
if there even are any,

32:36.820 --> 32:40.588
would be really hard to come by
if not impossible.

32:40.590 --> 32:42.624
I mean, there's got to be
something.

32:42.626 --> 32:46.461
What about citizenship, voting
registration, school enrollment?

32:46.463 --> 32:49.798
Katie, these people lived
over a hundred years ago.

32:49.800 --> 32:52.567
I mean, long before Google.

32:52.569 --> 32:55.470
And even if they had
any children,

32:55.472 --> 32:57.806
there's the possibility
that they're...

32:57.808 --> 33:00.142
uh, they were homeschooled
in their native tongue

33:00.144 --> 33:03.478
while the sheets were out
drying on the line.

33:03.480 --> 33:05.280
There has to be something.

33:05.282 --> 33:08.785
There's a father,
a mother and a girl about 12.

33:10.753 --> 33:15.690
And you're basing
your conclusions on...

33:15.692 --> 33:18.559
Hey, there has to be a record
of them coming into the country.

33:18.561 --> 33:21.762
What about a ship's manifest
from, I don't know,

33:21.764 --> 33:23.431
somewhere in the '1800s?

33:23.433 --> 33:26.300
Okay, I have to admit
I'm a little surprised.

33:26.302 --> 33:28.235
I mean, most people
are concerned

33:28.237 --> 33:30.271
with the prominent families,

33:30.273 --> 33:33.607
the captains of industry
and their money.

33:33.609 --> 33:37.348
And your fascination
is with the help?

33:40.350 --> 33:42.419
She might still be there.

33:44.588 --> 33:46.224
In my house.

33:47.224 --> 33:48.559
She?

33:50.260 --> 33:52.330
The girl.

33:55.599 --> 33:57.335
Ah.

33:59.369 --> 34:02.372
It sounds like maybe
you've met Rebekah.

34:03.540 --> 34:04.940
You know?

34:04.942 --> 34:06.878
Is that her name?

34:08.612 --> 34:11.947
Just as every house
has its storied past,

34:11.949 --> 34:16.250
many of them allegedly
have their resident ghosts.

34:16.252 --> 34:18.485
In fact, it was once said
that Lady Smith

34:18.487 --> 34:20.621
was in such competition
with Mrs. Kimberly

34:20.623 --> 34:24.462
that she boasted
of having a second ghost.

34:25.429 --> 34:28.529
Yours is Rebekah.

34:28.531 --> 34:30.764
Do you know anything else
about her?

34:30.766 --> 34:33.471
Well, you're not going to find
it here, I'll tell you that.

34:34.605 --> 34:37.739
Oh, so what's next?

34:37.741 --> 34:39.576
How far do you want
to take this?

34:41.677 --> 34:43.244
I don't know.

34:43.246 --> 34:45.279
I just...

34:45.281 --> 34:49.851
somehow this feels
important to me.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.688
To my family...

34:53.357 --> 34:55.458
she just seems familiar.

34:56.726 --> 35:00.462
Why does any ghost remain?

35:00.464 --> 35:03.565
An emotional attachment
to the place?

35:03.567 --> 35:05.333
Unfinished business?

35:05.335 --> 35:07.838
A yearning? A longing?

35:10.473 --> 35:12.342
Why don't you ask her?

36:49.005 --> 36:50.971
Hello?

36:50.973 --> 36:52.706
Are you there?

36:52.708 --> 36:54.878
Are you trapped
or something?

37:03.152 --> 37:05.355
Hey, Lucy.

37:06.690 --> 37:08.456
What's up, honey?

37:08.458 --> 37:11.628
There's a scratching
in my bedroom.

37:12.561 --> 37:15.031
Dad, you're on.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.777
Sort of in that area.

37:39.456 --> 37:41.659
Yeah, I think
it's in the wall.

37:42.893 --> 37:44.661
Maybe downstairs.

37:49.098 --> 37:51.666
Come on, squirt,
let's check it out.

37:51.668 --> 37:54.105
Seen the flashlight?

38:22.165 --> 38:24.199
I don't know.

38:24.201 --> 38:27.170
It's got to be around here
somewhere.

38:56.665 --> 38:59.166
Well, it's probably a rodent
of some sort.

38:59.168 --> 39:00.802
Maybe a rat.

39:00.804 --> 39:02.737
I'll call an exterminator
tomorrow.

39:08.177 --> 39:10.714
- Katie?
- Mom?

39:18.554 --> 39:20.521
Sound asleep.

39:20.523 --> 39:22.192
What was that?

39:23.692 --> 39:26.763
This is getting weirder
by the second.

39:43.779 --> 39:46.713
You didn't invite any
of your friends over, did you?

39:46.715 --> 39:48.985
Dad, it's a school night.

39:54.790 --> 39:57.160
I think it's coming
from the attic.

40:00.964 --> 40:02.764
Well...

40:02.766 --> 40:05.699
why don't we check this out
tomorrow?

40:05.701 --> 40:07.638
Really?

40:12.609 --> 40:14.675
All right.

40:14.677 --> 40:16.246
Let's see what it is.

40:29.326 --> 40:30.828
Wow.

40:32.996 --> 40:35.099
I haven't been
up here in ages.

40:36.632 --> 40:38.766
Remember, Dad,

40:38.768 --> 40:41.703
you said ghosts were BS.

40:41.705 --> 40:42.973
Yeah, I did, didn't I?

41:05.828 --> 41:07.864
Oh, my.

41:09.299 --> 41:10.868
Look at this.

41:18.641 --> 41:21.208
Hello?

41:21.210 --> 41:22.879
Where are you?

41:27.717 --> 41:30.083
Come on, you really
think someone's in here?

41:45.034 --> 41:46.668
Well, I'll be.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.005
A stairway.

41:49.272 --> 41:51.204
Did you know
about this stairway?

41:51.206 --> 41:55.442
I thought I explored
every inch of this house.

41:55.444 --> 41:58.880
Well, I guess
it's a servant's stairway.

41:58.882 --> 42:00.313
It probably goes down
to the kitchen,

42:00.315 --> 42:02.652
or somewhere else
on the first floor.

42:16.933 --> 42:18.802
You feel a light switch?

42:20.770 --> 42:24.706
You know this house might have
been built before electricity.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.708
Okay.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.442
You stay here. I'm going to go
to the first floor

42:28.444 --> 42:30.210
and see where this
comes out.

42:30.212 --> 42:31.813
I'm going to knock
on the walls,

42:31.815 --> 42:33.748
and when I get close
let me know.

42:33.750 --> 42:36.219
Uh, okay.

42:37.152 --> 42:38.788
Okay.

43:01.478 --> 43:03.047
Dad.

43:05.848 --> 43:09.886
Dad, I'm low on power.
I'm going to run out of power.

43:11.321 --> 43:12.786
Dad?

43:12.788 --> 43:14.457
Dad, where are you?

43:17.460 --> 43:19.860
Dad! Dad where are you?

43:23.532 --> 43:26.302
Dad, please get me
out of here.

43:30.239 --> 43:31.806
Dad!

43:31.808 --> 43:33.541
Dad!

43:33.543 --> 43:35.412
Dad, there's someone here!

43:44.520 --> 43:46.487
Dad, please get me
out of here!

43:46.489 --> 43:48.922
- Can you hear me, baby?
- Please help!

43:48.924 --> 43:50.359
Okay, I'm coming.

43:56.398 --> 43:58.034
I got you, baby.

43:59.835 --> 44:01.802
- You okay?
- No.

44:01.804 --> 44:03.840
You keep asking that.

44:05.241 --> 44:07.043
Oh, sweetie,
I'm sorry I left you.

44:08.177 --> 44:09.576
You know what?

44:09.578 --> 44:11.244
Why don't we just
go back to sleep.

44:11.246 --> 44:13.146
We can explore more
in the morning.

44:34.536 --> 44:39.542
All right, we've checked
every part of the house.

44:54.456 --> 44:56.993
Mystery solved.

44:59.094 --> 45:01.962
There's something stuck here
in the downspout.

45:01.964 --> 45:03.598
Huh.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.199
Like I said, I'll call
the exterminator tomorrow,

45:05.201 --> 45:07.300
they'll come out
and get it out.

45:07.302 --> 45:09.170
End of problem.

45:09.172 --> 45:11.005
Will they kill it?

45:11.007 --> 45:13.340
Well, whatever it is,
it's trapped.

45:13.342 --> 45:15.576
So if it gets out,
it'll probably just come back

45:15.578 --> 45:17.043
and get trapped again.

45:17.045 --> 45:18.378
So, yes, to answer
your question,

45:18.380 --> 45:20.350
they'll probably
put it to sleep.

45:22.351 --> 45:24.187
All right, come on.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.059
All right.

45:33.061 --> 45:35.061
You take out your phone,
call your mom.

45:35.063 --> 45:36.364
Tell her to come
open the door.

45:36.366 --> 45:38.965
My battery is dead, remember?

45:38.967 --> 45:40.904
Oh, boy.

45:44.473 --> 45:46.373
Oh, what the heck.

45:46.375 --> 45:48.208
If I'm going to take out
the ladder to wake up your mom,

45:48.210 --> 45:50.580
might as well
rescue a rat.

45:53.348 --> 45:56.183
All right,
you got it?

45:56.185 --> 45:58.121
Here, hold that.

45:59.922 --> 46:01.554
All right,
are you in there?

46:01.556 --> 46:03.157
Come on.

46:03.159 --> 46:05.159
- Go a little higher.
- All right.

46:05.161 --> 46:06.527
You got the ladder?

46:06.529 --> 46:08.395
I don't know
about this thing.

46:08.397 --> 46:10.166
Can you hold it?

46:14.170 --> 46:16.337
Come on,
get out of there.

46:16.339 --> 46:17.971
- Higher.
- Come on, man.

46:17.973 --> 46:20.041
Come on, you rat.

46:20.043 --> 46:21.442
Get out.

46:21.444 --> 46:23.143
Watch out, Dad.
Watch out.

46:31.688 --> 46:34.989
Dad, you're my hero.

46:34.991 --> 46:38.458
If you are done for the evening,
can we get back inside, please?

46:40.096 --> 46:41.931
Come on.

46:43.165 --> 46:45.034
Are you okay?

47:25.241 --> 47:27.476
- Lucy?
- Oh, what now.

47:28.777 --> 47:30.643
Lucy!

47:30.645 --> 47:32.248
What? What is it?

47:48.431 --> 47:51.068
You haven't
seen this before?

48:01.310 --> 48:04.744
It'll only be a few days.
Back before you know it.

48:04.746 --> 48:07.415
Can't you just do a Skype
meeting with these guys?

48:07.417 --> 48:09.315
You know how all that goes.

48:09.317 --> 48:11.988
I go in person, it puts me ahead
of everyone else who doesn't.

48:13.221 --> 48:15.056
It's just not
a good time.

48:15.058 --> 48:17.224
There's never a good time.

48:17.226 --> 48:19.692
When are you going
to be back?

48:20.797 --> 48:22.695
No way of knowing.

48:22.697 --> 48:24.230
Why?

48:24.232 --> 48:26.534
Well, there are just
some decisions

48:26.536 --> 48:28.201
that need to be made,
Dennis.

48:28.203 --> 48:30.670
Well, I need to get
something going.

48:30.672 --> 48:32.739
Either this offer
or something with Jack.

48:32.741 --> 48:36.409
I mean, the consulting business
just isn't what it used to be.

48:36.411 --> 48:38.781
At least not
in the paper industry.

50:07.737 --> 50:09.406
Hello?

51:38.293 --> 51:42.695
Hey, Lucy.
It's Uncle Jack.

51:42.697 --> 51:44.398
Come on, it's nasty weather
out there.

51:44.400 --> 51:46.536
Jump in.
I'm heading your direction.

51:48.471 --> 51:50.603
Don't talk to that man.

51:50.605 --> 51:53.040
Come on.

51:53.042 --> 51:56.409
That's okay.
I'm almost home.

51:56.411 --> 51:58.478
Come on, get in.

51:58.480 --> 52:01.517
Do not get in that car!

52:03.386 --> 52:04.884
Come on, get in.

52:04.886 --> 52:07.723
I'll give you a lift
right to your front door.

52:13.429 --> 52:16.896
There you go. You want a little
help with your seat belt?

52:16.898 --> 52:18.534
No, thank you.

52:33.715 --> 52:37.020
Look at you.
You are absolutely soaked.

52:38.554 --> 52:40.590
It's raining.

52:47.496 --> 52:50.364
I bet you can't wait to get out
of those wet clothes

52:50.366 --> 52:52.666
and into a nice,
hot shower, huh?

52:52.668 --> 52:55.369
Mr. Simmons,
I'm not really comfortable

52:55.371 --> 52:57.538
with the conversation
we're having.

52:57.540 --> 52:59.072
Oh, I'm sorry,
little girl.

52:59.074 --> 53:01.777
I was just making
nice-nice.

53:06.014 --> 53:11.384
Hey, Mr. Simmons, I think you
missed the turn to my house.

53:11.386 --> 53:13.987
- Mr. Simmons?
- Please, call me Jack.

53:13.989 --> 53:15.989
You missed the turn to my house.
It was back there.

53:15.991 --> 53:17.724
I know I did.

53:17.726 --> 53:19.992
I thought you'd like to take
a bit more of a ride

53:19.994 --> 53:21.598
and dry off.

53:26.101 --> 53:27.835
Now you shut up
and listen to me

53:27.837 --> 53:31.003
and do exactly
as I tell you to do,

53:31.005 --> 53:34.041
and you'll be home in time
for dinner with your mommy.

53:34.043 --> 53:35.842
When my dad hears about this...

53:35.844 --> 53:37.746
Your dad is not in town.

53:41.083 --> 53:43.987
- Let me out of here right now!
- Shut up!

54:36.071 --> 54:37.904
- Is that you, Luce?
- Yeah.

54:37.906 --> 54:39.540
I'm sorry I didn't
come and get you.

54:39.542 --> 54:41.507
I got a little busy
with this.

54:41.509 --> 54:43.911
It sounded like it was
really pouring for a while.

54:43.913 --> 54:45.813
Guess I'm a bad mom.

54:45.815 --> 54:47.614
I'm going to go take a shower.

54:47.616 --> 54:48.748
Sounds like a good idea.

54:48.750 --> 54:50.616
I'll get dinner going.

54:50.618 --> 54:52.686
When is dad going to be home?

54:52.688 --> 54:54.587
Uh, tomorrow.

54:54.589 --> 54:56.956
Uh, he mentioned that he's got
another meeting with Jack.

54:56.958 --> 54:58.692
You know, Mr. Simmons?

54:58.694 --> 55:00.726
There's a chance we might
get to keep the house.

55:00.728 --> 55:02.563
I don't think
that's going to happen.

55:02.565 --> 55:04.630
What, babe?

55:04.632 --> 55:06.535
Nothing.

55:13.542 --> 55:16.710
Yeah, I'm going to take her
to Dr. Allen tomorrow,

55:16.712 --> 55:18.945
just as a precaution.

55:18.947 --> 55:21.849
I just can't believe
he would try something like that.

55:21.851 --> 55:23.616
Unbelievable.

55:23.618 --> 55:25.485
- I'm going to the police.
- No, no, no, don't.

55:25.487 --> 55:28.721
I... they don't need to know
anything more right now.

55:28.723 --> 55:30.623
I wish I was there.

55:30.625 --> 55:32.159
Okay.

55:32.161 --> 55:34.261
I'm sorry you're
dealing with this.

55:34.263 --> 55:35.829
I love you.

55:35.831 --> 55:37.730
I love you, too.

55:37.732 --> 55:38.931
Okay, bye.

55:38.933 --> 55:40.602
Bye.

55:41.703 --> 55:43.705
Come here,
sweetheart.

55:46.842 --> 55:49.979
I would die if anything
ever happened to you.

55:55.851 --> 55:57.884
I love you.

55:57.886 --> 56:00.022
You sleep well, okay?

56:32.721 --> 56:34.257
It's you.

56:36.692 --> 56:39.860
How did you know
he was a bad man?

56:39.862 --> 56:41.831
Didn't you?

56:43.732 --> 56:46.065
Then why did you
get in the car?

56:46.067 --> 56:47.833
I was cold.

56:47.835 --> 56:51.840
And I thought because
he knew my dad, it was okay.

56:55.810 --> 56:57.978
Did you kill that man?

56:57.980 --> 57:00.817
No, but he would have
killed you.

57:02.884 --> 57:04.653
Who are you then?

57:05.688 --> 57:08.124
I want to be your sister.

57:57.406 --> 57:59.641
Who are you?

58:00.409 --> 58:02.912
I want to live.

58:08.717 --> 58:10.016
Leave me alone!

58:17.960 --> 58:20.797
Leave me alone, please.
Please.

58:24.900 --> 58:28.802
I think you need
to see this guy.

58:28.804 --> 58:30.804
I'm not one to say the Neenah
Library has met its match,

58:30.806 --> 58:33.706
but in your case,
I think maybe it has.

58:33.708 --> 58:35.208
He's the real deal.

58:35.210 --> 58:37.677
Retired now,
if a person in his profession

58:37.679 --> 58:39.980
can ever actually retire.

58:39.982 --> 58:42.018
How do you know him?

58:43.886 --> 58:45.819
He tried to help me recently.

58:45.821 --> 58:48.223
I hope he can help you.

58:50.225 --> 58:51.994
Thank you.

58:57.331 --> 58:59.933
Excuse me?

58:59.935 --> 59:02.768
Excuse me?

59:02.770 --> 59:04.270
Hello?

59:10.112 --> 59:11.311
Hello?

59:11.313 --> 59:13.713
Hi. Um, I'm sorry.
The...

59:13.715 --> 59:15.348
There wasn't a receptionist
out front,

59:15.350 --> 59:16.849
so I just let myself in.

59:16.851 --> 59:19.219
Oh, she's probably out
getting coffee.

59:19.221 --> 59:21.387
I can catch her.

59:21.389 --> 59:23.389
Oh, no. I'm fine.

59:23.391 --> 59:25.227
Cream? Sugar?

59:26.462 --> 59:29.329
That'd be great.

59:29.331 --> 59:33.233
Elsa, add a cappuccino
to that order, please.

59:33.235 --> 59:34.800
Thank you.

59:34.802 --> 59:35.902
Robert Ehrlich.

59:35.904 --> 59:37.103
Father Ehrlich.

59:37.105 --> 59:39.005
Uh, Katie Lukens.

59:39.007 --> 59:40.840
Katie Lukens.

59:40.842 --> 59:43.275
I haven't heard
that name before.

59:43.277 --> 59:44.878
There's a list,
continually updated,

59:44.880 --> 59:47.246
of every name
in our parish.

59:47.248 --> 59:50.416
I pray for them all daily.

59:50.418 --> 59:53.018
You pray for hundreds of people
every day?

59:53.020 --> 59:55.087
Thousands.

59:55.089 --> 59:58.157
Those that have not yet
taken their first breath

59:58.159 --> 01:00:01.194
and those who are about to take
their last.

01:00:01.196 --> 01:00:04.364
What parish
do you belong to?

01:00:04.366 --> 01:00:07.003
Uh... we don't.

01:00:07.969 --> 01:00:10.103
Another faith community?

01:00:10.105 --> 01:00:12.371
No. Not at the moment.

01:00:12.373 --> 01:00:13.907
Oh.

01:00:13.909 --> 01:00:16.208
Please.

01:00:16.210 --> 01:00:18.244
Have a seat.

01:00:18.246 --> 01:00:20.015
Thank you.

01:00:29.123 --> 01:00:31.558
What can I do for you,
Mrs. Lukens?

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.559
How did you know
I was married?

01:00:33.561 --> 01:00:35.962
Well, when I asked you
what parish you belonged to,

01:00:35.964 --> 01:00:37.463
you said, "we don't."

01:00:37.465 --> 01:00:39.833
Which means a family unit.

01:00:39.835 --> 01:00:41.802
Am I right?

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:43.536
My husband's name
is Dennis.

01:00:43.538 --> 01:00:46.239
And we... we weren't really
raised in any kind

01:00:46.241 --> 01:00:48.375
of religious tradition.

01:00:48.377 --> 01:00:51.244
Uh, we have a daughter, Lucy.
She's 14.

01:00:51.246 --> 01:00:53.279
Other children?

01:00:53.281 --> 01:00:55.050
No.

01:00:56.585 --> 01:00:58.054
So...

01:01:00.022 --> 01:01:02.922
why are you here, Katie?

01:01:03.991 --> 01:01:05.391
I'm not sure.

01:01:05.393 --> 01:01:07.194
We were doing research
on our house.

01:01:07.196 --> 01:01:09.094
It's about 125 years old.

01:01:09.096 --> 01:01:10.864
- Mm-hmm.
- And we were just wondering

01:01:10.866 --> 01:01:12.599
about the former occupants,
because...

01:01:12.601 --> 01:01:15.201
I see someone got through
our elaborate security?

01:01:15.203 --> 01:01:17.971
Elsa, this is Katie Lukens.

01:01:17.973 --> 01:01:19.973
Pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Lukens.

01:01:19.975 --> 01:01:21.340
Likewise, thank you.

01:01:21.342 --> 01:01:23.946
Thank you.

01:01:25.214 --> 01:01:27.848
So, Miss Squire, the librarian,

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:30.016
she said that you might
be a good source

01:01:30.018 --> 01:01:31.317
to talk to about this.

01:01:31.319 --> 01:01:33.353
Lovely lady.

01:01:33.355 --> 01:01:35.621
I only met her once.

01:01:35.623 --> 01:01:39.625
I have no idea
what she meant.

01:01:39.627 --> 01:01:41.393
It's embarrassing,
but we think

01:01:41.395 --> 01:01:44.931
that there could be
something in our house.

01:01:44.933 --> 01:01:47.103
- Mm-hmm.
- Like a...

01:01:48.002 --> 01:01:49.501
a spirit.

01:01:49.503 --> 01:01:51.840
A spirit?

01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:56.643
Do you feel any danger
in your house?

01:01:56.645 --> 01:01:59.916
Any for you
and your family?

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:02.485
Yes.

01:02:06.154 --> 01:02:11.127
Mrs. Lukens, please understand
I'm here to serve you.

01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.063
What is it you're not
telling me?

01:02:19.634 --> 01:02:22.902
I'm sorry, Father, I... I...

01:02:22.904 --> 01:02:26.306
If there is something
in your house,

01:02:26.308 --> 01:02:28.174
to put it frankly,

01:02:28.176 --> 01:02:31.344
there has to be a void
for it to be there.

01:02:31.346 --> 01:02:33.112
A void?

01:02:33.114 --> 01:02:35.482
A vacuum. An emptiness.

01:02:35.484 --> 01:02:38.951
What do you think
might be lacking, Father?

01:02:38.953 --> 01:02:42.922
Something that can give you
protection

01:02:42.924 --> 01:02:45.160
for you and your family.

01:03:04.612 --> 01:03:07.112
Okay, so...

01:03:07.114 --> 01:03:12.955
when something is hungry
or... or trapped....

01:03:14.121 --> 01:03:16.389
you become alarmed.

01:03:16.391 --> 01:03:18.194
Why?

01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:24.063
Are you trapped?

01:03:24.065 --> 01:03:26.032
Are you...

01:03:26.034 --> 01:03:29.138
are you threatened
in some way?

01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:50.893
How's it going?

01:03:54.763 --> 01:03:56.665
I'm pregnant, remember?

01:04:03.572 --> 01:04:05.308
How was your trip?

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:08.340
Same old routine.

01:04:08.342 --> 01:04:10.009
Times are tight,
we'll get back to you.

01:04:10.011 --> 01:04:12.045
The usual.

01:04:12.047 --> 01:04:13.512
Everyone wants
to hire a consultant,

01:04:13.514 --> 01:04:15.583
but no one wants
to pay for one.

01:04:18.786 --> 01:04:21.122
So where are you
with this?

01:04:23.357 --> 01:04:26.092
Where am I?

01:04:26.094 --> 01:04:28.427
Where are you?

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:33.168
You left me here
to deal with this by myself.

01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:39.471
I...

01:04:39.473 --> 01:04:45.277
wanted to respect
whatever decision you make.

01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:48.047
I don't even know
if there's a decision to make.

01:04:48.049 --> 01:04:49.715
What's that mean?

01:04:49.717 --> 01:04:52.152
I just feel so alone.

01:04:52.154 --> 01:04:55.154
And this,
in this house.

01:04:55.156 --> 01:04:58.590
There is something here,
Dennis.

01:04:58.592 --> 01:05:01.661
Or someone here
in this house.

01:05:01.663 --> 01:05:03.465
Lucy was right.

01:05:05.232 --> 01:05:09.304
Katie, you're not going
to let some apparition...

01:05:10.605 --> 01:05:13.672
cloud your judgment?

01:05:13.674 --> 01:05:16.675
Is this like part
of being pregnant or something?

01:05:16.677 --> 01:05:19.482
This is not
my hormones talking.

01:05:20.781 --> 01:05:22.181
This is real.

01:05:22.183 --> 01:05:23.718
Okay.

01:05:27.422 --> 01:05:31.327
Can we even do this now?
Financially?

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.030
Money.

01:05:38.132 --> 01:05:39.634
You know what?

01:05:42.203 --> 01:05:44.105
I'll take care of it.

01:05:45.139 --> 01:05:46.342
I'll take care of it.

01:06:40.228 --> 01:06:42.398
What the...?

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:46.635
Who are you?

01:06:47.935 --> 01:06:50.271
What's going on here?

01:06:56.310 --> 01:06:58.413
Daddy.

01:07:28.275 --> 01:07:30.476
I'd say you're about
9 weeks along.

01:07:30.478 --> 01:07:32.414
First trimester.

01:07:35.282 --> 01:07:36.683
Um...

01:07:36.685 --> 01:07:39.851
do you think there'll be
any complications?

01:07:39.853 --> 01:07:41.320
Not this early.

01:07:41.322 --> 01:07:43.489
It's a perfectly safe
procedure.

01:07:43.491 --> 01:07:45.895
No harm or risk
whatsoever.

01:07:53.902 --> 01:07:56.438
May I schedule
for next week?

01:07:59.674 --> 01:08:01.310
Uh...

01:08:03.877 --> 01:08:05.480
yes.

01:08:48.956 --> 01:08:50.354
Hello?

01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:51.991
I found them.

01:08:51.993 --> 01:08:54.460
- Who?
- The Steins.

01:08:54.462 --> 01:08:57.363
The Clarksons' servants.
You were right.

01:08:57.365 --> 01:08:59.631
Their name is Stein.

01:08:59.633 --> 01:09:02.033
And what about
their daughter?

01:09:02.036 --> 01:09:03.970
They had no daughter.

01:09:03.971 --> 01:09:05.970
They were childless.

01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:07.707
Are you sure?

01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:10.975
Back then families
were always buried together,

01:09:10.978 --> 01:09:14.680
especially if the child
died prematurely.

01:09:14.682 --> 01:09:17.381
Then...

01:09:17.384 --> 01:09:19.587
then who is Rebekah?

01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:22.758
She may not exist.

01:09:24.024 --> 01:09:27.393
She may never
have existed.

01:09:55.522 --> 01:09:57.625
How does it feel?

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.393
Feel?

01:10:00.395 --> 01:10:02.431
Being alive.

01:10:04.132 --> 01:10:06.899
It can be a pain
sometimes.

01:10:06.901 --> 01:10:09.402
But not all the time.

01:10:09.404 --> 01:10:13.642
Maybe not all the time,
but lately, most of the time.

01:10:16.044 --> 01:10:18.543
If I can touch you someday

01:10:18.545 --> 01:10:20.813
and you can feel it,

01:10:20.815 --> 01:10:22.618
will you know it's me?

01:10:29.391 --> 01:10:32.759
Why are you here then?

01:10:32.761 --> 01:10:35.894
I want to be here.
I need to be here.

01:10:35.896 --> 01:10:37.632
This is my home.

01:10:38.732 --> 01:10:42.003
Okay, but why?

01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:45.874
I want to live.

01:10:50.544 --> 01:10:52.077
Lucy?

01:10:52.079 --> 01:10:53.781
Yes?

01:10:55.950 --> 01:10:59.922
Something bad
is going to happen.

01:11:11.098 --> 01:11:12.631
No!

01:11:12.633 --> 01:11:14.502
Moloch!

01:12:02.784 --> 01:12:04.786
How are you, Katie?

01:12:10.991 --> 01:12:13.061
You were visited again?

01:12:14.963 --> 01:12:16.863
Yes.

01:12:16.865 --> 01:12:19.034
And contact was made?

01:12:20.535 --> 01:12:21.937
Yes.

01:12:24.172 --> 01:12:25.904
It spoke to me.

01:12:25.906 --> 01:12:27.640
It said a word.

01:12:27.642 --> 01:12:31.543
It was, um...
"moloch," I think.

01:12:31.545 --> 01:12:33.749
Or "molluck."

01:12:36.217 --> 01:12:38.754
Do you know
what that means?

01:12:43.691 --> 01:12:47.225
I can't say that word in here.
This is too sacred a place.

01:12:47.227 --> 01:12:50.598
And that name,
too profane.

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:04.543
Although you may
find an image,

01:13:04.545 --> 01:13:07.014
it'll only be a mere
representation of Moloch.

01:13:09.683 --> 01:13:11.716
Also known as Molech,

01:13:11.718 --> 01:13:15.054
and a host of other
blasphemous variations.

01:13:15.056 --> 01:13:19.292
Moloch is the name
of an ancient Ammonite god.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:22.627
He appears in the
Book of Deuteronomy,

01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:25.032
and then once again
in the Book of Leviticus.

01:13:26.633 --> 01:13:28.768
There is a valley, Gehenna,

01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:30.670
by Jerusalem,

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:33.573
where apostate Israelites

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:37.710
and followers
of various false gods,

01:13:37.712 --> 01:13:39.244
including Moloch,

01:13:39.246 --> 01:13:43.718
sacrificed their children
by fire.

01:13:45.820 --> 01:13:47.987
They sacrificed them?

01:13:47.989 --> 01:13:50.221
The threw their
newborn children into fire.

01:13:50.223 --> 01:13:52.026
Moloch demanded it.

01:13:53.628 --> 01:13:55.827
How could they do that?
Why would they do that?

01:13:55.829 --> 01:13:59.064
The pagan world was cruel.

01:13:59.066 --> 01:14:02.234
They wanted success,
security, prosperity.

01:14:02.236 --> 01:14:05.738
But if their fortune was at risk
on the seas

01:14:05.740 --> 01:14:07.340
and their ship came in,

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:11.610
a child was a gift
of gratitude.

01:14:11.612 --> 01:14:14.613
If they had a great
misfortune,

01:14:14.615 --> 01:14:16.851
the child was the price.

01:14:17.785 --> 01:14:19.719
Was there weeping?

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:22.688
I'm sure there was.

01:14:22.690 --> 01:14:24.290
But why children?

01:14:24.292 --> 01:14:26.993
I mean, what does this demigod
want with children?

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:29.694
Moloch mocks God

01:14:29.696 --> 01:14:32.797
by desiring what is God's,
not his.

01:14:32.799 --> 01:14:37.036
I'm not saying that God hates
one thing more than another.

01:14:37.038 --> 01:14:40.672
But the innocent blood
of a child

01:14:40.674 --> 01:14:43.011
is a de facto sacrifice
to Moloch.

01:14:45.879 --> 01:14:49.982
Out of our arrogance,
it seems that we have control.

01:14:49.984 --> 01:14:54.819
But God is the author
of all life.

01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:57.892
He owns life itself.

01:15:00.027 --> 01:15:02.028
The question is, Katie,

01:15:02.030 --> 01:15:04.933
what do you
think it means?

01:15:07.435 --> 01:15:11.606
I think your daughter's
in danger.

01:15:12.673 --> 01:15:14.176
Mortal danger.

01:15:36.196 --> 01:15:37.932
I must go now.

01:15:41.736 --> 01:15:43.435
Where are you going?

01:15:43.437 --> 01:15:45.738
Away.

01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.872
Why?

01:15:47.874 --> 01:15:49.276
Moloch.

01:15:50.311 --> 01:15:52.411
What's that?

01:15:52.413 --> 01:15:54.180
Destroyer of life.

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:55.948
And it's coming here?

01:15:55.950 --> 01:15:57.953
Right here.

01:16:00.855 --> 01:16:02.387
Hey, wait a minute.

01:16:02.389 --> 01:16:04.924
Why is Moloch coming?

01:16:04.926 --> 01:16:06.727
He was invited.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:54.506
No!

01:16:54.508 --> 01:16:56.876
Let me go! Stop!

01:16:58.812 --> 01:16:59.979
- Get off me!
- Baby...

01:16:59.981 --> 01:17:01.846
Stop it!
Get off me!

01:17:01.848 --> 01:17:03.815
- Hey...
- No! Let go.

01:17:05.285 --> 01:17:07.886
Let go.

01:17:07.888 --> 01:17:09.257
Oh, God.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.262
No.

01:17:51.031 --> 01:17:52.333
Ow.

01:18:00.074 --> 01:18:03.210
Dennis? Dennis!

01:18:04.277 --> 01:18:06.211
Sister, where are you?

01:18:06.213 --> 01:18:07.846
Dennis!

01:18:07.848 --> 01:18:09.948
Hey. You okay?

01:18:09.950 --> 01:18:11.382
I don't know!

01:18:11.384 --> 01:18:13.385
- What's going on here?
- I don't know!

01:18:13.387 --> 01:18:15.320
Oh!

01:18:20.026 --> 01:18:21.527
Oh, Father Ehrlich.

01:18:24.932 --> 01:18:27.131
This is the priest
I was telling you about.

01:18:27.133 --> 01:18:30.034
I see. Come in, please.

01:18:30.036 --> 01:18:32.003
And you too, Katie?

01:18:32.005 --> 01:18:33.372
You welcome me here?

01:18:33.374 --> 01:18:35.174
Yes. Yes, you are.

01:18:35.176 --> 01:18:37.044
Thank you.

01:18:42.249 --> 01:18:44.949
This house has never
been blessed.

01:18:48.923 --> 01:18:50.421
St. Michael
and the archangels,

01:18:50.423 --> 01:18:52.658
defend us in battle.

01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:54.560
Be our protection against
the wickedness...

01:18:54.562 --> 01:18:57.532
Are you going to bless
the house now, Father?

01:19:00.334 --> 01:19:03.338
It's too late for that.

01:19:06.539 --> 01:19:08.506
Well, can we do something?

01:19:08.508 --> 01:19:10.141
No.

01:19:10.143 --> 01:19:12.614
Just stay here.

01:19:16.918 --> 01:19:18.684
As smoke is driven away,

01:19:18.686 --> 01:19:21.386
so they'll be
driven away.

01:19:32.532 --> 01:19:35.935
As wax melts before a fire,

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:39.238
the wicked will perish

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:41.877
in the presence of God.

01:19:52.119 --> 01:19:53.621
Lucy.

01:19:54.554 --> 01:19:56.191
May you be protected...

01:19:58.058 --> 01:20:00.158
from all unclean spirits,

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.962
satanic powers...

01:20:03.964 --> 01:20:07.268
and wicked legions
and similes.

01:20:09.102 --> 01:20:11.906
And the strengths and powers
of our Lord, Jesus Christ.

01:20:14.575 --> 01:20:16.211
Amen.

01:20:20.313 --> 01:20:23.247
By the holy authority
of our ministry,

01:20:23.249 --> 01:20:25.552
we confidently undertake...

01:20:29.222 --> 01:20:32.358
and reject the attacks

01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:36.397
and the deceit of Satan.

01:20:37.431 --> 01:20:40.101
Dennis and Katie Lukens...

01:21:07.027 --> 01:21:08.594
Ah.

01:21:08.596 --> 01:21:10.432
There you are.

01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.435
Beast.

01:21:46.299 --> 01:21:48.833
May God rebuke,
we humbly pray,

01:21:48.835 --> 01:21:51.235
and do thou, O Prince
of the heavenly host,

01:21:51.237 --> 01:21:53.775
by the divine power of God...

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:11.790
We meet again.

01:22:11.792 --> 01:22:15.262
You who are called
Desolation.

01:22:16.196 --> 01:22:17.464
Blasphemy.

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:01.340
The owner of all life

01:23:01.342 --> 01:23:05.210
and the author
of our faith

01:23:05.212 --> 01:23:08.116
has dominion here.

01:23:27.935 --> 01:23:33.372
Cast into hell,
Satan of the evil spirit.

01:23:33.374 --> 01:23:36.507
It is he who
claims the child

01:23:36.509 --> 01:23:39.677
of Katie and Dennis Lukens.

01:23:58.298 --> 01:24:00.866
He who is in me

01:24:00.868 --> 01:24:04.438
is greater than he
who is in the world.

01:24:52.386 --> 01:24:55.423
And who might you be,
my little one?

01:24:59.927 --> 01:25:03.431
This is my family...

01:25:07.468 --> 01:25:09.333
How are you?

01:25:09.335 --> 01:25:11.435
Alive.

01:25:11.437 --> 01:25:12.906
Hmm.

01:25:15.375 --> 01:25:17.512
That will be my prayer.

01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:35.396
What happened?

01:25:38.699 --> 01:25:40.564
It's gone.

01:25:40.566 --> 01:25:44.002
That's it?
It's... it's gone?

01:25:44.004 --> 01:25:46.872
Yes. At least for now.

01:25:46.874 --> 01:25:49.474
Well, is there anything...

01:25:49.476 --> 01:25:51.379
I mean...

01:25:52.879 --> 01:25:54.779
It's simple.

01:25:54.781 --> 01:25:57.985
Just don't give it
what it wants.

01:26:06.893 --> 01:26:09.394
Please protect
the life in there.

01:26:09.396 --> 01:26:10.996
As long as you do,

01:26:10.998 --> 01:26:13.567
you won't hear from
any evil spirits any longer.

01:26:16.402 --> 01:26:18.572
I don't think you know
what I mean.

01:26:20.106 --> 01:26:21.573
I do.

01:26:21.575 --> 01:26:22.944
Protect Lucy.

01:26:24.477 --> 01:26:26.877
We both know
what I'm talking about.

01:26:26.879 --> 01:26:30.584
Protect all the life
in this house.

01:26:33.486 --> 01:26:37.122
By the way, it's bad form
to lie to a priest.

01:26:37.124 --> 01:26:40.391
Should you ever have the good
sense to become a Catholic,

01:26:40.393 --> 01:26:43.364
I will see you
in confession.

01:26:44.530 --> 01:26:46.398
I'll take you home.

01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:47.733
No.

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:49.904
I can find my way home.

01:27:34.514 --> 01:27:36.915
I was watching a
spider make its web,

01:27:36.917 --> 01:27:39.687
and it was simply glorious.

01:27:40.987 --> 01:27:43.622
It let out the silk
from its body

01:27:43.624 --> 01:27:47.024
and wove it in such
an intricate pattern.

01:27:47.026 --> 01:27:50.761
I was truly amazed
at its artistry.

01:27:50.763 --> 01:27:54.433
Then a man came along
to paint the post,

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:56.902
and he painted
all over everything,

01:27:56.904 --> 01:28:01.006
destroying the spider's web
and the spider as well.

01:28:01.008 --> 01:28:05.880
I do not know if he did this
by accident or on purpose.

01:28:07.481 --> 01:28:10.916
I watched the poor spider
writhing in pain

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:12.917
as it suffocated,

01:28:12.919 --> 01:28:17.488
its many legs reaching
for something to grasp,

01:28:17.490 --> 01:28:23.094
longing, searching for air,
searching for light.

01:28:23.096 --> 01:28:26.230
It was in its natural habitat,

01:28:26.232 --> 01:28:30.068
and the world came in
and destroyed it.

01:28:30.070 --> 01:28:33.939
As the spider died,
part of me died, too.

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:39.610
Tell me why you're here.

01:28:39.612 --> 01:28:41.883
You don't know?

01:28:42.816 --> 01:28:44.549
No.

01:28:44.551 --> 01:28:46.486
We were a happy family.

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.820
We weren't perfect,

01:28:49.822 --> 01:28:53.527
but things weren't
that bad either.

01:28:54.727 --> 01:28:56.730
But then you showed up.

01:28:59.532 --> 01:29:02.067
I almost remember the day.

01:29:02.069 --> 01:29:04.002
I'm sure you do.

01:29:04.004 --> 01:29:06.872
So why are you here?

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:09.777
I'm here to protect
your daughters.

01:29:10.776 --> 01:29:12.579
Daughters?

01:29:14.213 --> 01:29:15.747
That's impossible.

01:29:15.749 --> 01:29:18.486
Is it?

01:29:21.722 --> 01:29:24.588
You're not the girl
in the pinafore dress.

01:29:24.590 --> 01:29:27.594
She never was.

01:29:53.719 --> 01:29:55.789
- May I?
- Mm.

01:29:57.190 --> 01:29:59.291
How are you doing?

01:29:59.293 --> 01:30:01.626
I'm good.

01:30:01.628 --> 01:30:02.927
I feel okay.

01:30:05.331 --> 01:30:07.799
I'm at peace
with my decision.

01:30:07.801 --> 01:30:11.235
Well, I don't think
there's a whole lot more

01:30:11.237 --> 01:30:13.074
for me to offer you.

01:30:14.775 --> 01:30:17.178
Should feel free to go
in the next few hours.

01:30:19.846 --> 01:30:22.646
In the old days, didn't...

01:30:22.648 --> 01:30:24.986
didn't women get to stay
for a few days?

01:30:26.186 --> 01:30:28.956
Like you said,
the old days.

01:31:00.020 --> 01:31:01.856
Hi, Luce.

01:31:02.822 --> 01:31:04.021
She's wrinkly.

01:31:04.023 --> 01:31:05.122
Mm-hmm.

01:31:05.124 --> 01:31:06.890
That'll go away...

01:31:06.892 --> 01:31:09.260
and then come back
in about 40 years.

01:31:09.262 --> 01:31:11.195
Can I hold her?

01:31:11.197 --> 01:31:13.767
Of course.

01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:17.204
There you go.

01:31:21.074 --> 01:31:22.373
Funny.

01:31:22.375 --> 01:31:24.643
I feel like
I know her already.

01:31:24.645 --> 01:31:26.344
Like she belongs.

01:31:27.713 --> 01:31:29.146
This is cool.

01:31:29.148 --> 01:31:31.750
Can you take a picture?

01:31:31.752 --> 01:31:33.120
Sure, honey.

01:31:41.027 --> 01:31:42.762
Have you chosen
a name yet?

01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:49.100
I was thinking
about Rebekah.

01:31:49.102 --> 01:31:51.839
That is the most
lovely name.

01:31:56.075 --> 01:31:57.876
That's right.

01:31:57.878 --> 01:32:00.748
Oh, you're losing
your hat.

01:32:08.054 --> 01:32:10.889
Hey. My turn.

01:32:10.891 --> 01:32:13.158
Want to go to Daddy?

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:14.826
Okay, let me...

01:32:14.828 --> 01:32:16.931
- There you go.
- There you are.

01:32:26.940 --> 01:32:29.841
Will miracles
never cease?

01:32:29.843 --> 01:32:32.943
You know, if you believe
the old Italian proverb

01:32:32.945 --> 01:32:37.415
that every baby comes with
a loaf of bread under its arm.

01:32:37.417 --> 01:32:38.882
Bread?

01:32:38.884 --> 01:32:41.485
Do you have
a loaf of bread?

01:32:41.487 --> 01:32:44.189
Hmm?

01:32:44.191 --> 01:32:46.757
Should I wait a few weeks
before throwing her in the air?

01:32:46.759 --> 01:32:49.226
I think that's a good idea,
babe.

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:53.000
All right,
let's go to mama.

01:32:53.999 --> 01:32:55.902
Here you go.

01:32:56.902 --> 01:32:58.869
Hello, little baby.

01:32:58.871 --> 01:33:02.342
Oh, there you go. Yeah.

01:33:04.111 --> 01:33:06.845
Great, she's officially
now more popular than me.

01:33:06.847 --> 01:33:08.846
Well, you're going
to have to get used to that

01:33:08.848 --> 01:33:12.018
with a little
baby sister around.

01:33:19.892 --> 01:33:22.195
Oh, my gosh. It's her.

01:39:30.629 --> 01:39:33.167
You ready?

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:47.700
