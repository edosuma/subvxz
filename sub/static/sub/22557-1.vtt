home so they can be laundered

07:31.018 --> 07:32.819

But it's almost 6:00.

Mariah, so nice to see you.

08:15.732 --> 08:17.064
Hello, Lucy.

08:17.066 --> 08:20.134
So sorry, Mrs. Inadomi. I
know you're closing, but...

08:20.136 --> 08:23.739
Oh, isn't he darling?

08:23.741 --> 08:25.941
Sure, but you know what Mom and Dad say...

08:25.943 --> 08:27.708
"Dogs are trouble."

08:27.710 --> 08:31.313
But ever-so-worth-it
and ever-so-snuggly.

08:31.315 --> 08:34.352
Grandma! Is that, like, even sanitary?

08:38.255 --> 08:39.988
[Mariah narrating] <i>Did you see that?</i>

08:39.990 --> 08:41.991
<i>Remember what I said about grandmas?</i>

08:41.993 --> 08:45.762
<i>They have a sneaky way of figuring
out how to make everyone happy.</i>

08:45.764 --> 08:49.065
Mariah, I hear you're working
on the pet fashion show.

08:49.067 --> 08:52.104
Thanks to you kids, we'll be
able to have our adoption fair.

08:55.373 --> 08:58.440
She's a little older, and those
puppies were climbing all over her,

08:58.442 --> 09:02.211
so I moved her to her
own special apartment.

09:02.213 --> 09:06.417
- She's a quiet little girl. Never hear a peep out of her.
- [choir vocalizing]

09:06.419 --> 09:10.390

it happened, love at first sight.</i>

09:11.222 --> 09:13.456
Oh, she's so sweet.

09:13.458 --> 09:16.225
So well-behaved. And doesn't shed.

09:16.227 --> 09:18.896
- She's hypoallergenic.
- [stifles chuckle]

09:18.898 --> 09:21.965
Did someone maybe tell you
my dad's allergic to dogs?

09:21.967 --> 09:23.435
Huh?

09:23.437 --> 09:26.937
I was just pointing out
one of her many attributes.

09:26.939 --> 09:29.874
She's such a little princess in every way.

13:55.585 --> 13:58.455
[humming]

14:03.694 --> 14:07.098
[Mariah narrating] <i>And I had to get my
little brother to keep our back door shut.</i>

14:11.035 --> 14:13.670
Uh, the back door was, like, wide open.

14:13.672 --> 14:15.438
I know I closed it.

14:15.440 --> 14:16.573
Brett?

14:16.575 --> 14:18.074
Sorry.

14:18.076 --> 14:20.343
What were you two doing outside?

14:20.345 --> 14:24.247
Oh, darling, we've been admiring
Ingersoll's Christmas display.

14:24.249 --> 14:26.315
It's a doozy this year.

14:26.317 --> 14:29.419
[Mariah's mom] There's no accounting
for taste. It's an eyesore.

14:29.421 --> 14:31.521
Oh, there's my girl. [kisses]

14:31.523 --> 14:33.656
Come here, Penny.

14:33.658 --> 14:37.027
I have a vision for a whole reindeer herd

14:37.029 --> 14:39.129
pulling a sleigh the size of a Winnebago

14:39.131 --> 14:41.198
that can fit the whole family.

14:41.200 --> 14:42.666
It'll wrap around the house,

14:42.668 --> 14:44.734
continue up on the roof.

14:44.736 --> 14:47.271
A thousand blinking lights!

14:47.273 --> 14:50.306
Let's see Fred Ingersoll top that.

14:50.308 --> 14:51.575
Blinking lights?

14:51.577 --> 14:53.212
[singsong] Tacky.

14:53.812 --> 14:56.080
Not in our yard.

14:56.082 --> 14:57.815
- Ouch!
- Wait till they're baked!

14:57.817 --> 15:00.185
- [Mariah giggling]
- Oh, come on! [muttering]

15:00.187 --> 15:01.688
[laughing]

15:04.625 --> 15:06.057
[car honking]

15:06.059 --> 15:07.658
Dad's got the tree!

15:07.660 --> 15:08.996
Brett!

15:10.164 --> 15:11.532
- [bell jingling]
- Close the door, dude.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.634
[laughs]

15:16.636 --> 15:19.770
[Mariah narrating] <i>I had to give it
to Grandma. She knew how to work it.</i>

15:19.772 --> 15:23.076
<i>She really made a case for Princess.</i>

15:23.078 --> 15:26.279
You can't use the dog
allergy excuse this time.

15:26.281 --> 15:28.614
- [groans] Mom!
- You heard me.

15:28.616 --> 15:31.520
The dog's "hypoallergenetic"
or whatever they call it.

15:34.856 --> 15:38.758
Oh, Brett, sweetie, let's
not do tinsel. It's so...

15:38.760 --> 15:39.593
[together] Tacky.

15:41.362 --> 15:43.562
And you can't say she hasn't earned a pet.

15:43.564 --> 15:45.798
She's so responsible and thoughtful.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.401
Does her chores and
everybody else's chores too.

15:48.403 --> 15:49.502
[giggles] Ouch!

15:49.504 --> 15:51.871
Top of her class, soloing in the choir.

15:51.873 --> 15:54.241
Model United Nations representative.

15:54.243 --> 15:57.177
Mrs. Reyes better elect
her Model UN president.

15:57.179 --> 15:59.545
[inhales sharply] I so
hope that she gets it.

15:59.547 --> 16:01.682
What does Mariah hope for?

16:01.684 --> 16:04.550
[stuttering] These are Mariah's goals.

16:04.552 --> 16:07.289
Maybe 'cause someone
told her they should be.

16:09.492 --> 16:11.593
Ow! Ma!

16:11.595 --> 16:13.428
Lucy, all her accomplishments

16:13.430 --> 16:15.662
could fall apart with a
distraction like a pet.

16:15.664 --> 16:17.364
What's wrong with a distraction?

16:17.366 --> 16:19.834
She needs to be a little girl.

16:19.836 --> 16:21.736
She doesn't know what she'd be taking on.

16:21.738 --> 16:24.606
Uh, Bud? That garland's upside-down.

16:24.608 --> 16:28.142
[sighs] And when she finds
out she's in over her head,

16:28.144 --> 16:30.545
I'll be the one taking care of the mutt.

16:30.547 --> 16:32.280
It's time to put the topper on the tree.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.451
I've got that totally covered!

16:38.856 --> 16:39.857
Daddy?

16:41.592 --> 16:43.327
Up you go, Supergirl.

16:44.928 --> 16:46.394
[gasps]

16:46.396 --> 16:48.163
[laughs]

16:48.165 --> 16:51.469
Isn't she the most beautiful
dog you've ever seen?

16:54.304 --> 16:55.804
Where are you going?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.907
I gotta get ready to take
my brother to the airport.

16:57.909 --> 17:00.810
Oh, I have something for Uncle Reg.

17:00.812 --> 17:02.479
I made him a potholder.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.281
Hmm.

17:04.282 --> 17:06.815
Ah, that's very thoughtful of you, Mariah.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.487
I'm sure he'll treasure it.

17:14.525 --> 17:16.461
[humming]

17:27.372 --> 17:28.773
What do you call <i>that</i> thing?

17:28.775 --> 17:32.376
It's not a "thing." She's a dog.

17:32.378 --> 17:34.812
I asked Santa for her.

17:34.814 --> 17:37.480
[Mariah narrating] <i>Well, a lot of
good that had done me in the past,</i>

17:37.482 --> 17:38.916
<i>but I was still hoping</i>

17:38.918 --> 17:41.851
<i>that somehow Santa would
get it right this time.</i>

17:41.853 --> 17:44.757
Her name is Princess,
and she's a poo-chon.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.893
A poo-chon? [laughs]

17:48.895 --> 17:51.630
[Mariah narrating] <i>Such a loving
and supportive little brother.</i>

17:51.632 --> 17:53.398
[sighs]

17:53.400 --> 17:56.567
Dopey, it means part poodle and bichon,

17:56.569 --> 17:58.438
and she's perfectly perfect.

17:59.739 --> 18:02.576
[Brett] Oh, look. Now she's part pug.

18:04.644 --> 18:05.811
Brett!

18:05.813 --> 18:07.446
[laughs]

18:07.448 --> 18:08.846
[groans] You're such a clown.

18:08.848 --> 18:10.748
Jealous?

18:10.750 --> 18:12.288
Priceless.

18:15.422 --> 18:17.390
I can help, Mariah.

18:17.392 --> 18:18.326
No, thanks, Beth.

18:21.328 --> 18:23.930
You're scared I'll mess her up.

18:23.932 --> 18:25.731
No, I'm not.

18:25.733 --> 18:28.401
It's just... I'm done. There.

18:28.403 --> 18:29.371
[car approaching]

18:31.905 --> 18:33.905
[Mariah narrating] <i>Daddy
could never say no to me.</i>

18:33.907 --> 18:36.277
Look, Daddy!

18:36.279 --> 18:39.046
<i>But he always figured out a
way to do it without saying it,</i>

18:39.048 --> 18:41.481
<i>especially when it came to a dog.</i>

18:41.483 --> 18:42.615
[engine revving]

18:42.617 --> 18:43.816
Possible.

18:43.818 --> 18:45.486
Maybe, maybe not.

18:45.488 --> 18:47.591
I'll get back to you on that.

18:48.923 --> 18:51.493
I'll have to discuss that with your mother.

18:53.962 --> 18:55.729
You'll have to take that up with Santa.

18:55.731 --> 18:58.699
[Mariah narrating] <i>But this
Christmas was his best yet.</i>

18:58.701 --> 19:00.567
<i>He really pulled a fast one on me.</i>

19:00.569 --> 19:04.774
[humming]

19:12.049 --> 19:14.417
I could wrap some of yours, Mariah.

19:15.786 --> 19:19.357
Um, I think I've got it, but thanks.

19:26.330 --> 19:29.432
Mariah. I think you hurt
your sister's feelings.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.634
On, no. I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.

19:31.636 --> 19:33.536
Couldn't you let her wrap just one?

19:33.538 --> 19:35.037
Does it really matter how it looks?

19:35.039 --> 19:38.808
Well, this one's for my teacher,
so it's gotta be perfect.

19:38.810 --> 19:41.543
[Penny] What were you thinking?
We should have discussed this.

19:41.545 --> 19:43.612
[chuckles] It'll work out just fine.

19:43.614 --> 19:44.650
Trust me.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.118
Oh! [laughs]

19:49.120 --> 19:50.854
Well, lookee here.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.822
What's that, Daddy?

19:52.824 --> 19:54.491
I have a proposal for you.

19:54.493 --> 19:55.794
Can't wait to hear it.

19:57.061 --> 19:59.096
Reggie needs a dog-sitter for,

19:59.098 --> 20:01.798
you know, his pooch, while he's away.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.567
Uncle Reggie has a dog?

20:03.569 --> 20:06.770
Hmm... It was a recent acquisition.

20:06.772 --> 20:09.373
Thought he couldn't have
pets at his apartment.

20:09.375 --> 20:13.377
Oh, t-they made an exception for this one.

20:13.379 --> 20:15.512
Mm-mm-mm.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.549
Can I dog-sit the
dog? I can dog-sit!

20:18.551 --> 20:20.984
[Mariah narrating] <i>Oh, no,
you didn't. Uh-uh. Nuh-uh-uh.</i>

20:20.986 --> 20:23.521
Oh, Daddy, I'd be the
best dog-sitter ever.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.922
Let me see. Let me see.

20:24.924 --> 20:27.524
- <i>And I fell right into his trap.</i>
- Come on, Daddy!

20:27.526 --> 20:30.127
But wait. H-Here's the deal.

20:30.129 --> 20:33.664
Let's see how you do
dog-sitting <i>this</i> guy,

20:33.666 --> 20:36.167
and then we'll see about... what's her...?

20:36.169 --> 20:37.602
Princess.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.670
I can have Princess if I dog-sit?

20:39.672 --> 20:40.872
Grandma!

20:40.874 --> 20:42.808
Dog-sit well.

20:42.810 --> 20:44.510
I'm all about well. That's me.

20:44.512 --> 20:45.811
I can do well. I promise.

20:45.813 --> 20:47.812
Let me see him. I bet he's so cute!

20:47.814 --> 20:50.682
[chuckling] Yeah, he sure is.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.016
Something like that.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.121
Okay.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.521
Oh, boy.

20:55.523 --> 20:57.458
Bud, you're not going to...

21:00.027 --> 21:01.997
Oh. He's, uh...

21:03.698 --> 21:04.999
Is that a dog?

21:06.700 --> 21:08.601
[Mariah] Ugh!

21:08.603 --> 21:11.170
Don't worry, Pen. I'm pretty
sure Reggie house-trained him.

21:11.172 --> 21:12.805
What's his name?

21:12.807 --> 21:14.139
Huh?

21:14.141 --> 21:15.641
Don't look at me, darling.

21:15.643 --> 21:17.209
Oh, yeah. Uh...

21:17.211 --> 21:18.878
[sniffing, barks]

21:18.880 --> 21:20.813
[Mariah] Did Uncle Reggie even train him?

21:20.815 --> 21:22.517
Hey! Whoo!

21:23.686 --> 21:24.919
Jack!

21:24.921 --> 21:26.887
[Mariah] Come here, Jack! Come here, baby.

21:26.889 --> 21:28.456
- [Penny] Bud!
- Come over here.

21:28.458 --> 21:29.723
- [Bud] He's harmless.
- Oh, no.

21:29.725 --> 21:31.661
[barking]

21:33.895 --> 21:35.929
Come here, good boy.

21:35.931 --> 21:37.698
- [Bud] Whoa! Hey!
- Catch him, Grandma!

21:37.700 --> 21:39.967
- Come here, you!
- [Bud] Hey! I said hey!

21:39.969 --> 21:41.168
Ooh, the demon!

21:41.170 --> 21:42.769
- Bud, do something!
- I'll catch him!

21:42.771 --> 21:44.103
Settle down now!

21:44.105 --> 21:46.640
- [Penny] Off the couch!
- [Bud] Hey, now stop that!

21:46.642 --> 21:48.576
[Bud] Can you sit? Stay?

21:48.578 --> 21:49.978
Lie down?

21:49.980 --> 21:52.613
Whoa, whoa. Catch him. Good
Lord, I think he has rabies.

21:52.615 --> 21:53.849
[Bud] Come here, you!

21:53.851 --> 21:54.882
Jack!

21:54.884 --> 21:56.817
[barking]

21:56.819 --> 21:58.556
[Mariah] Whoa!

22:03.559 --> 22:04.828
[sniffing]

22:06.596 --> 22:07.798
Where's he going?

22:09.900 --> 22:10.999
My steaks!

22:11.001 --> 22:12.805
Mm-mm-mm.

22:14.105 --> 22:15.606
[screams]

22:17.575 --> 22:18.673
Stop!

22:18.675 --> 22:19.909
[growling]

22:19.911 --> 22:21.911
Oh, hey. Hey, hey!

22:21.913 --> 22:25.213
[shouts] Drop it, you thief!

22:25.215 --> 22:28.617
- [bell jingles]
- [Brett] What's for dinner?

22:28.619 --> 22:30.286
Shut the door!

22:30.288 --> 22:31.988
Whoa.

22:31.990 --> 22:33.890
Some kind of giant
rat-thing just ran past me.

22:33.892 --> 22:35.562
[groans]

22:39.064 --> 22:40.834
- [door opens]
- Steak, all right!

22:42.233 --> 22:44.034
I know. I know, Pen.

22:44.036 --> 22:46.135
We should have discussed
this together first.

22:46.137 --> 22:49.708
Oh, Bud, dear, it looks
like he took your steak.

22:52.877 --> 22:55.011
Jack!

22:55.013 --> 22:57.079
Here, boy! Here, baby!

22:57.081 --> 22:58.886
Come here, little guy.

22:59.886 --> 23:00.988
Jack!

23:03.290 --> 23:05.623
Uh, hi, Mr. Ingersoll.

23:05.625 --> 23:08.725
Did you maybe see a
small dog-thing around?

23:08.727 --> 23:12.663
Hmm. It's just befuddling.

23:12.665 --> 23:14.198
- Can I help you with something?
- What's that?

23:14.200 --> 23:17.100
Oh, hello, Mariah.

23:17.102 --> 23:20.971
I just can't figure out why
my lights aren't blinking.

23:20.973 --> 23:22.741
I bought blinking lights.

23:22.743 --> 23:25.810
Just not as cheerful when they don't blink.

23:25.812 --> 23:28.215
Not sure, Mr. Ingersoll.

23:29.317 --> 23:31.750
Jack?

23:31.752 --> 23:32.887
Where'd you go?

23:34.688 --> 23:36.056
Jack!

23:38.826 --> 23:41.296
[low growling]

23:42.163 --> 23:43.899
Jack?

23:46.233 --> 23:49.038
[munching]

23:52.873 --> 23:55.544
[low growl]

23:56.945 --> 23:58.915
[growling]

24:00.681 --> 24:02.083
[grunts]

24:03.784 --> 24:06.019
- [barking]
- Hold still, guy.

24:06.021 --> 24:08.224
[groaning]

24:10.994 --> 24:12.659
[sniffing]

24:12.661 --> 24:16.030
Yum. This looks so tasty.

24:16.032 --> 24:17.333
[lips smacking] Mmm!

24:19.034 --> 24:20.134
Mmm.

24:20.136 --> 24:22.903
[whimpering]

24:22.905 --> 24:27.641
Scrumptious! This is the best
steak I've ever had in the world.

24:27.643 --> 24:29.042
Yum, yum.

24:29.044 --> 24:31.811
Nuh-uh! This is my dinner.

24:31.813 --> 24:32.949
Yum!

24:33.983 --> 24:35.919
Come on. You know you want it.

24:37.955 --> 24:40.022
- [door opens]
- Follow me.

24:40.024 --> 24:42.860
That's it. Just a little further.

24:48.832 --> 24:50.331
[sighs] Ha!

24:50.333 --> 24:51.933
I gotcha.

24:51.935 --> 24:53.068
Hi!

24:53.070 --> 24:55.436

Oh, honey, I doubt that.

He's made a mess of Christmas.

I have a confession to make.

He wasn't really Uncle Reggie's dog.

01:09:43.937 --> 01:09:46.470
- What?
- What?

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:48.474
He was a stray Reggie found.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:51.243
He was gonna drop him at the
shelter, but then I got...

01:09:51.245 --> 01:09:53.077
One of your ideas.

01:09:53.078 --> 01:09:55.012
I got a collar.

01:09:55.014 --> 01:09:58.716
I thought if you had a
taste of a brute like Jack,

01:09:58.718 --> 01:10:01.519
you'd change your mind about having a dog.

01:10:01.521 --> 01:10:04.823
So you wouldn't have to say no.

01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:07.059
Son, I might be a devil of a prankster,

01:10:07.061 --> 01:10:10.096
but even I wouldn't stoop
to such a rotten trick.

01:10:10.098 --> 01:10:12.664

01:10:12.666 --> 01:10:14.934
Passive-aggressive?

01:10:14.936 --> 01:10:17.837
- Yeah.
- It was a dirty trick.

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:20.038
No one could have handled that mutt.

01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:21.908
I'm so sorry.

01:10:21.910 --> 01:10:23.676
We still should find him.

01:10:23.678 --> 01:10:26.846
We will, but there's
somewhere we need to be first.

01:10:26.848 --> 01:10:30.249
That's right. The adoption center
closes early on Christmas Eve.

01:10:30.251 --> 01:10:33.187
- You mean...
- Let's go pick up Princess.

01:10:33.189 --> 01:10:35.990
- Really?
- We decided.

01:10:35.992 --> 01:10:38.892
[gasps] Oh, Daddy, thank you!

01:10:38.894 --> 01:10:41.529
Hopefully, Princess won't
be anything like Jack.

out another pet, Son?
