Previously on "Ninjago.."

00:03.133 --> 00:04.439
[Lloyd]
The Sons of Garmadon want

00:04.526 --> 00:05.657
to bring back my father
from the death.

00:05.744 --> 00:08.138
That was Zane's plan all along.

00:08.225 --> 00:10.227
He's just gained their trust.

00:10.314 --> 00:13.013
[Ultra Violet]
You're bringing him
to the Big Man?

00:14.536 --> 00:16.842
[birds chirping]

00:16.929 --> 00:19.323
[instrumental music]

00:28.898 --> 00:30.160
[knocks]

00:34.512 --> 00:36.253
Can I help you?

00:36.340 --> 00:38.821
I'm looking for a boy
named Zane.

00:38.908 --> 00:41.998
Hm.
He's out back chopping wood.

00:42.085 --> 00:44.174
I'll take you to him.

00:44.261 --> 00:45.958
It's curious.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.136
You're our second guest
in a long while.

00:49.223 --> 00:51.964
An old man visited us
last night.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.750
He had taken ill
and needed shelter.

00:54.837 --> 00:58.188
It was as if winter
had followed him here.

00:58.275 --> 00:59.755
The Master of Ice.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.932
Well, of course,
we gave him shelter, food.

01:03.019 --> 01:07.545
He was very thankful
and very intrigued by my son.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.243
It's peculiar.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.680
Ever since he left,
Zane's been acting

01:11.767 --> 01:13.638
stranger than usual.

01:13.725 --> 01:16.380
- Very peculiar indeed.
- Here he is.

01:24.867 --> 01:28.653
- Hello, Zane.
- Hello. Have we met?

01:28.740 --> 01:30.481
No, but some would say

01:30.568 --> 01:33.528
I have a knack
at finding young talent.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.269
Do you need me to chop wood?

01:35.356 --> 01:38.924
[chuckles]
Maybe one day, but not today.

01:39.011 --> 01:41.492
Then why are you here?
Are you lost?

01:41.579 --> 01:44.800
Lost?
Mm, an interesting word.

01:44.887 --> 01:49.631
Sometimes one has to be lost
in order to be found.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.502
But that does not make
any sense.

01:51.589 --> 01:55.245
Maybe one day, but not today.
Goodbye, Zane.

01:55.332 --> 01:58.248
- Uh, will I see you again?
- I am sure of it.

01:58.335 --> 02:02.644
And when we do, you'll be asked
to do far more than chop wood.

02:07.692 --> 02:10.130

02:52.346 --> 02:53.782

02:53.869 --> 02:55.218

02:56.350 --> 02:58.526

[gasps]

03:03.748 --> 03:05.097
[sighs]

03:16.239 --> 03:20.374
It's time you meet the Big Man.

03:20.461 --> 03:22.593
The Big Man?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.334
[Ultra Violet laughs]

03:24.421 --> 03:26.815
[dramatic music]

03:28.947 --> 03:31.298
- Where was Zane last seen?
- 'Central Station.'

03:31.385 --> 03:33.865
[Jay]
'But once they went underground,
P.I.X.A.L. lost his signal.'

03:33.952 --> 03:36.346
'We haven't been able to pick up
Cole's intercom either.'

03:36.433 --> 03:38.174
If they're taking Zane
to their hideout

03:38.261 --> 03:40.263
then Cole could be held captive.

03:44.136 --> 03:46.704
We can't lose Zane.
I'm over Central now.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.880
[grunting]

03:53.233 --> 03:55.409
Oh, look, son,
it's that Green Ninja.

03:55.496 --> 03:57.062
Is it? Where?

03:57.149 --> 03:58.455
There! Look!

03:59.848 --> 04:03.547
Yeah, right, dad. Very funny.

04:03.634 --> 04:07.203
[Lloyd]
'No sign of Zane or Cole.
They could be anywhere by now.'

04:07.290 --> 04:10.772
[clanking]
Do you mind, sis? We're tryin'
to save Cole and Zane.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.556
What do you think I'm doing?

04:12.643 --> 04:16.038
Zane won't last long undercover
in a biker gang without a bike.

04:16.125 --> 04:17.779
- Oh.
- Harumi?

04:17.866 --> 04:19.694
Can you hand me
the electric torque wrench?

04:19.781 --> 04:20.999
Yes, of course.

04:22.566 --> 04:25.613
Oh, sweetie,
that's a torque multiplier.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.311
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:28.398 --> 04:31.401
Maybe I should be doing
something more useful.

04:31.488 --> 04:32.968
Lloyd, did you find
their hideout?

04:33.055 --> 04:34.883
No sign of Zane or Cole.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.319
They could be anywhere by now.

04:36.406 --> 04:37.842
[Jay]
'Don't worry, we'll find them.'

04:37.929 --> 04:39.801
'Kai and I will search
other stations.'

04:42.020 --> 04:43.892
Where are you, Zane?

04:46.808 --> 04:48.897
[grunting]

04:52.814 --> 04:54.468
[groans]

04:54.555 --> 04:56.774
Vengestone. Ah!

04:56.861 --> 04:58.907
- 'Careful.'
- 'What do you think I'm doing?'

05:00.735 --> 05:03.651
- So what's in the box?
- You haven't heard?

05:05.217 --> 05:07.872
Boss found the key
to the last mask.

05:07.959 --> 05:12.050
Oh, if they get the last mask,
then they'll have all three.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.662
[scoffs]
It's all comin' together.

05:14.749 --> 05:17.447
It will be good
to see Lord Garmadon here.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.580
You mean it will be bad.

05:19.667 --> 05:22.409
[both laughing]

05:22.496 --> 05:24.280
Lord Garmadon?

05:24.367 --> 05:27.370
Hey! You always talk
to yourself this much?

05:27.457 --> 05:30.199
- Shut it!
- Ha-ha-ha!

05:30.286 --> 05:32.070
I don't talk to myself
that much.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.290
I mean sometimes,
but not that much.

05:34.377 --> 05:37.162
I mean, it's only
when I just gotta.. Uh!

05:39.208 --> 05:41.863
[rock music]

06:02.536 --> 06:03.711
Um..

06:03.798 --> 06:05.277
[growls]

06:05.365 --> 06:07.410
So you're the Big Man?

06:08.846 --> 06:10.152
[growls]

06:10.239 --> 06:12.981
And you're the scum
who saved Mr. E.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.074
[laughing]

06:20.684 --> 06:23.557
They say your name
is Snake Jaguar.

06:23.644 --> 06:25.820
And what sort of name is that?

06:25.907 --> 06:27.822
The sort that can put you
on your backside

06:27.909 --> 06:29.214
if you have to ask.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.695
[roaring]

06:36.004 --> 06:38.441
[grunts]

06:38.528 --> 06:41.488
[laughing]

06:41.575 --> 06:44.273
So you're in charge
of the Sons of Garmadon?

06:44.360 --> 06:47.755
[laughs]
He thinks I'm in charge.

06:47.842 --> 06:49.931
[laughter]

06:50.018 --> 06:51.672
I'm Killow.

06:51.759 --> 06:54.936
It's my job to decide
who's in and who's out.

06:55.023 --> 06:57.329
[crowd cheering]

07:00.202 --> 07:02.160
You wanna know more about us?

07:02.247 --> 07:04.772
First, you gotta become
one of us.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.078
And to be a son of Garmadon

07:07.165 --> 07:09.820
'you first have to ride
with us.'

07:09.907 --> 07:12.127
So what do you say,
boys and girls

07:12.214 --> 07:14.608
shall we take him to The Teeth?

07:14.695 --> 07:18.046
[all chanting]
Teeth! Teeth!
Teeth! Teeth! Teeth!

07:18.133 --> 07:20.701
Eyes forward, weirdo.

07:20.788 --> 07:22.050
- Agh!
- What is The Teeth?

07:22.137 --> 07:24.531
Like I said, you want answers

07:24.618 --> 07:26.489
first you have to ride.

07:26.576 --> 07:29.492
[laughs]
He doesn't have a bike.

07:29.579 --> 07:31.755
[all laughing]

07:31.842 --> 07:34.802
You want to join
a motorcycle gang

07:34.889 --> 07:36.978
and you have no bike?

07:37.065 --> 07:39.981
[crowd booing]

07:40.068 --> 07:42.462
I rammed it right down
those Ninja's throats.

07:42.549 --> 07:43.724
They had it coming.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.160
[crowd cheering]

07:45.247 --> 07:47.684
You could have Ultra Violet's.

07:47.771 --> 07:50.731
Huh? What? What, uh..
But I wanna ride!

07:50.818 --> 07:53.429
The Quiet One wants you here.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.344
[sighs]

07:55.431 --> 07:57.172
The Quiet One?

07:58.739 --> 08:02.090
I want a word with the Ninja
in private.

08:02.177 --> 08:03.613
Oh, oh, hey, easy.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.441
Of course, Ultra Violet.
He's all yours.

08:05.528 --> 08:07.487
Yeah, as long as it's not me.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.401
Uh, do whatever you want to.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.493
I ain't in the mood, sunshine.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.845
- Zane!
- Shh.

08:17.932 --> 08:21.588
[laughs]
Oh, aren't you a sight
for sore eyes.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.981
- Did they hurt your eyes?
- Yes.. No..

08:24.068 --> 08:26.418
I'll explain later.
Just get me out of here.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.595
They have the key
to the third mask.

08:28.682 --> 08:29.726
The key?

08:29.813 --> 08:31.511
If they unite all the masks

08:31.598 --> 08:33.164
they're gonna resurrect
Lord Garmadon.

08:33.251 --> 08:35.427
The bad one.
Four arms and all.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.604
We need to get that key
and get out of here.

08:39.431 --> 08:41.259
- Um..
- Well?

08:41.346 --> 08:42.783
What are you waiting for?
Unlock the door.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.872
- Let's go.
- I can't.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.135
I need to ride with them
to learn who's behind all this.

08:47.222 --> 08:51.008
They're gonna get all the masks.
Who cares who's in charge?

08:51.095 --> 08:52.880
When the station clears,
break out.

08:52.967 --> 08:54.882
Break out and steal the key.

08:54.969 --> 08:57.101
[Ultra Violet]
'What do you mean
I just walked past here?'

08:57.188 --> 08:59.451
- 'Get your eyes fixed.'
- Good luck, friend.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.366
How am I supposed
to steal the key?

09:01.453 --> 09:04.413
I need a key. Zane. Zane!

09:06.023 --> 09:07.677
Uh, uh, uh..

09:07.764 --> 09:10.332
Sane! I-I'm not sane.

09:10.419 --> 09:13.074
Get me out of here.
I'm insane!

09:13.161 --> 09:14.205
[gibberish]

09:14.292 --> 09:16.207
You and I both.

09:16.294 --> 09:17.557
[laughs]

09:17.644 --> 09:20.037
[dramatic music]

09:21.952 --> 09:24.346
[engine revving]

09:28.655 --> 09:29.960
Bikers, ready?

09:31.179 --> 09:32.920
[Killow laughs]

09:34.356 --> 09:36.837
You know the rules
when you ride with us?

09:36.924 --> 09:39.187
Let me guess.
There are no rules.

09:41.015 --> 09:44.105
Well, that was no fun, was it?

09:44.192 --> 09:50.677
Ride or die!'

09:50.764 --> 09:53.070
[engines revving]

09:53.157 --> 09:55.595
Come on, Zane.
You can do this.

09:55.682 --> 09:57.553
[engine revving]

09:57.640 --> 09:58.772
[laughs]

10:01.122 --> 10:02.297

10:05.039 --> 10:07.041
[telephone ringing]

10:07.128 --> 10:10.044
What do you want?
Oh, no, I-I'm sorry.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.741
I-I didn't know it was you.

10:11.828 --> 10:13.177
What? He is?

10:13.264 --> 10:14.614
I'll tell Killow right away.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.138
[dramatic music]

10:20.228 --> 10:21.838
[phone beeps]
Yes.

10:21.925 --> 10:23.361
- 'He's one of the Ninja.'
- Who?

10:23.448 --> 10:27.452
- 'Snake Jaguar.'
- Snake Jaguar's a spy?

10:27.539 --> 10:30.412
Make sure the new guy
doesn't finish the race.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.461
[crash]

10:36.548 --> 10:38.463

11:15.022 --> 11:16.414
Ah!

11:22.551 --> 11:25.119
I see you, Ninja!

11:26.990 --> 11:28.513
[grunts]

11:35.172 --> 11:36.608
Ice..

11:39.524 --> 11:41.483
[train horn blaring]

11:45.879 --> 11:47.054
Darn it!

11:58.543 --> 11:59.631
Phew!

12:24.874 --> 12:26.484
[screams]
Dang it.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.835
It didn't spill my coffee.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.663
Well, what are you waiting for?
Go, go, go.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.666
[siren wailing]

12:40.585 --> 12:42.239
Still didn't spill my..

12:43.850 --> 12:45.939
[dramatic music]

12:48.028 --> 12:49.899
[Zane]
'P.I.X.A.L., can you read me?'

12:49.986 --> 12:52.902
My cover may be blown, but I've
spotted the mask of deception.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.817
[P.I.X.A.L.]
'I read you.
Acquiring picture.'

12:58.168 --> 13:00.344
Did he say
he sees the Mask of Deception?

13:00.431 --> 13:02.172
[Zane]
'I don't know
how long I'll last.'

13:02.259 --> 13:04.958
'So I'll tell you this now.
I don't know who's in charge.'

13:05.045 --> 13:07.525
'But he is known,
as The Quiet One.'

13:07.612 --> 13:10.006
- The Quiet One?
- Hold tight a little longer.

13:10.093 --> 13:12.356
We have a new bike
coming to you now.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.054
Zane, where is Cole?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.319
[grunts]

13:19.799 --> 13:21.583
[sighs]

13:21.670 --> 13:23.846
Okay, think. Think Cole.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.892
You're not thinking.
You're running your mouth.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.458
Look, who's talking.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.417
Now I am having
a conversation with myself.

13:29.504 --> 13:33.073
- How annoying is that--
- 'Hey, Dangerbuff, be quiet.'
