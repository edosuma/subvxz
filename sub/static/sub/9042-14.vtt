WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:03.400
- WHY DO WE HAVE
TO GO SHOPPING?

00:03.400 --> 00:05.000
- IT'S JUST A COUPLE
OF THINGS, ALL RIGHT?

00:05.000 --> 00:06.200
COME ON,
STOP WHINING.

00:06.200 --> 00:08.700
- I WANT TO GO HOME!

00:08.700 --> 00:09.900
- WHAT DID I SAY?

00:09.900 --> 00:11.800
- THIS IS BORING.

00:11.800 --> 00:16.133
- LOOK, JUST BE GOOD, AND WE'LL
STOP BY THE RUM DEPARTMENT.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.800
GO GET US A THING
OF BROCCOLI, ALLY.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.300
- I HATE BROCCOLI.

00:23.300 --> 00:25.367
- HEY, YOUR MOM
MAKES THE LIST, OKAY?

00:25.367 --> 00:27.033
IF IT WAS UP TO ME,
IT'D BE ALL MARSHMALLOWS.

00:27.033 --> 00:29.333
GO.

00:30.433 --> 00:32.400
LET'S GET
SOME MARSHMALLOWS.

00:42.900 --> 00:44.867
- EXCUSE ME.

00:44.867 --> 00:46.800
NO FREE SAMPLING.

00:46.800 --> 00:50.133
- I'M NOT SAMPLING.
I'VE HAD THIS BEFORE.

00:52.400 --> 00:54.733
- YEAH, RIGHT, WELL,
IT'S NOT A SNACK BAR.

00:54.733 --> 00:57.033
- RELAX, PAL,
I JUST TOOK A LITTLE.

00:57.033 --> 00:58.767
- YEAH, WELL, IF EVERYBODY
STEALS A LITTLE,

00:58.767 --> 01:01.400
THE STORE GOES A LITTLE BIT
OUT OF BUSINESS.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.433
- WHAT, ARE YOU
CALLING ME A THIEF?

01:03.433 --> 01:05.267
- ONLY 'CAUSE YOU'RE
TAKING SOMETHING

01:05.267 --> 01:07.367
WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT.

01:07.367 --> 01:10.100
- HOW MUCH DID I TAKE,
A NICKEL'S WORTH?

01:10.100 --> 01:13.233
HERE.
HERE'S A QUARTER.

01:13.233 --> 01:15.400
KEEP THE CHANGE.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.567
- DON'T THROW MONEY AT ME.

01:17.567 --> 01:19.633
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

01:19.633 --> 01:21.533
- LET'S GO, DAD.

01:21.533 --> 01:22.933
SORRY.
I'M REAL SORRY.

01:22.933 --> 01:24.633
- HEY, DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR ME.

01:24.633 --> 01:27.100
HE'S THE ONE BLOWING A GASKET
OVER A HANDFUL OF BIRDSEED.

01:27.100 --> 01:31.067
- IT'S CALLED STEALING,
CUE BALL!

01:31.067 --> 01:34.667
- I GOT HAIR, PORKY!

01:34.667 --> 01:36.767
- DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON ME!
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

01:36.767 --> 01:38.233
- WE'RE GONNA GO.
WE'RE GONNA GO.

01:38.233 --> 01:39.667
DAD, LET'S GO
LOOK AT SOME MEAT.

01:39.667 --> 01:41.233
- YEAH, YEAH,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

01:41.233 --> 01:42.633
- YOU GOT PROBLEMS, PAL.

01:42.633 --> 01:45.167
- HEY, I'M A VETERAN!
- OKAY, DAD, OKAY!

01:45.167 --> 01:46.600
- LOOK AT HIM!

01:46.600 --> 01:48.000
YOU TELL ME HE'S NEVER
DONE ANY SAMPLING?

01:48.000 --> 01:50.300
- COME ON, DAD!

01:51.500 --> 01:53.400
- [sighs]

01:53.400 --> 01:56.767
I'M GOING BACK TO TEACHING.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.700
[upbeat rock music]

01:58.700 --> 02:00.267
- [singing] JUNGLE LOVE

02:00.267 --> 02:01.500
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:01.500 --> 02:05.000
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY

02:05.000 --> 02:06.733
JUNGLE LOVE

02:06.733 --> 02:08.133
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:08.133 --> 02:11.667
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY

02:11.667 --> 02:13.033
JUNGLE LOVE

02:13.033 --> 02:14.667
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:14.667 --> 02:17.933
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY

02:17.933 --> 02:19.667
JUNGLE LOVE

02:19.667 --> 02:21.100
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD

02:21.100 --> 02:25.233
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY

02:32.067 --> 02:33.533
- RAY, CAN I HAVE SOME CHIPS?

02:33.533 --> 02:36.567
- WHY DON'T YOU GO TO AMY
FOR CHIPS?

02:36.567 --> 02:40.367
- I GO TO AMY'S...
FOR OTHER THINGS.

02:43.900 --> 02:47.233
- HERE'S YOUR CHIPS,
AND I OWE YOU A NIGHTMARE.

02:52.467 --> 02:54.767
- RAY, WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR DAD TODAY

02:54.767 --> 02:56.233
AT THE SUPERMARKET?

02:56.233 --> 02:58.167
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- ALLY'S PRETTY UPSET.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.667
SHE SAID HE WAS SCREAMING
AND CALLING A MAN NAMES.

03:00.667 --> 03:01.667
- IT WAS NOTHING.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.733
THE PRODUCE GUY
ACCUSED HIM OF STEALING.

03:03.733 --> 03:05.100
- WAS HE STEALING?

03:05.100 --> 03:06.800
- HE WAS SAMPLING
THE TRAIL MIX.

03:06.800 --> 03:09.933
- YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO SAMPLE THE TRAIL MIX.

03:09.933 --> 03:13.067
- HENCE THE HULLABALOO.

03:15.767 --> 03:18.500
- SO ALLY SAW
YOUR FATHER STEAL FOOD

03:18.500 --> 03:21.333
AND THEN WATCHED HIM
MAKE A BIG SCENE IN PUBLIC.

03:21.333 --> 03:24.467
- AH, HER FIRST TIME.

03:28.933 --> 03:31.733
A RITE OF PASSAGE.

03:31.733 --> 03:34.200
I REMEMBER MINE--
THE NEW YORK STATE THRUWAY,

03:34.200 --> 03:37.333
DAD THROWING PENNIES
AT THE TOLL COLLECTOR.

03:38.433 --> 03:39.467
- YEAH.

03:39.467 --> 03:41.967
THIS TIME
HE THREW A QUARTER.

03:41.967 --> 03:43.667
- INFLATION.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.367
[both laughing]

03:45.367 --> 03:48.100
- HEY, IT'S NOT FUNNY.
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

03:48.100 --> 03:50.167
WHY CAN'T HE BEHAVE HIMSELF?

03:50.167 --> 03:53.400
- WHY CAN'T A DOG
PLAY THE TRUMPET?

03:54.500 --> 03:57.033
- [chuckling]

03:57.033 --> 03:59.500
- IT'S NOT FUNNY,
ROBERT.

04:01.133 --> 04:02.467
- WHAT?
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

04:02.467 --> 04:03.767
YOU WANT ME
TO TALK TO HER?

04:03.767 --> 04:05.767
- NO, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TALK TO HER.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.233
I WANT YOU
TO TALK TO HIM.

04:09.233 --> 04:11.133
- I'LL TALK TO HER.

04:11.133 --> 04:12.633
- NO, RAY.

04:12.633 --> 04:15.833
YOUR FATHER HAS TO REALIZE
THAT HE'S NOT A GORILLA.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.567
HE'S GOT GRANDKIDS.
HE HAS TO SET AN EXAMPLE.

04:18.567 --> 04:20.400
- YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY SHOULD
GO SAY SOMETHING TO HIM.

04:20.400 --> 04:22.133
- WHY DON'T YOU?
- DON'T NEED TO.

04:22.133 --> 04:24.267
YOUR DAUGHTER,
YOUR PROBLEM.

04:25.367 --> 04:28.100
- YOU'RE STUPID.
YOU'RE UGLY.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.700
- COME ON, YOU GOT TO
SAY SOMETHING.

04:33.700 --> 04:35.167
- [groans]

04:37.033 --> 04:38.967
- [whispering] TALK TO HIM.

04:38.967 --> 04:41.633
- [whispering] LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S SO PEACEFUL.

04:46.300 --> 04:48.067
- FOR CRYING OUT LOUD,
I'LL DO IT.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.267
- NO, YOU'RE TOO MEAN.

04:49.267 --> 04:52.800
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

04:52.800 --> 04:55.367
I'LL DO IT.

04:55.367 --> 04:57.400
HEY, DAD, CAN WE TURN
THIS OFF FOR A SECOND?

04:57.400 --> 04:59.133
- HEY!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:59.133 --> 05:00.800
- WE'RE WATCHING HERE.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.300
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, DAD.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.500
WE THINK YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT ALLY WAS KIND OF UPSET

05:05.500 --> 05:08.133
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE GUY AT THE MARKET.

05:09.400 --> 05:10.867
- OKAY.

05:10.867 --> 05:13.100
TURN THE TV BACK ON.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.567
- WAIT A SECOND.
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:15.567 --> 05:19.233
- AW, THE JACKASS FRUIT GUY
ACCUSED ME OF STEALING.

05:20.567 --> 05:24.700
- FRANK, PLEASE!
THEY'RE "HOMOSEXUALS."

05:34.200 --> 05:37.033
- NO, THE GUY WHO WORKS
IN THE FRUIT DEPARTMENT,

05:37.033 --> 05:38.233
THE FAT ONE.

05:38.233 --> 05:40.433
- JIMMY?
OH, I LOVE HIM.

05:40.433 --> 05:43.133
HE'S THE ONE WHO GETS ME
THE GOOD PEACHES.

05:43.133 --> 05:44.967
WHAT WERE YOU STEALING?

05:44.967 --> 05:46.400
- NOTHING--
I JUST TOOK A LITTLE

05:46.400 --> 05:48.400
OF THE SNACKING MIX
OUT OF THE THING.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.633
- OH, WELL,
THAT'S NOT STEALING.

05:50.633 --> 05:53.767
- TECHNICALLY, MOM,
IT IS THEFT.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.100
PETTY THEFT.

05:56.100 --> 05:59.433
UNLESS YOU ATE MORE
THAN A HUNDRED DOLLARS' WORTH.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.500
DID YOU?

06:04.000 --> 06:07.133
- NO, I DIDN'T,
OFFICER DOOFUS.

06:08.700 --> 06:10.300
BESIDES, I PAID FOR IT.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.833
- WELL, YOU--YOU THREW
A QUARTER AT THE GUY.

06:12.833 --> 06:15.567
- TOSSED.

06:15.567 --> 06:17.100
- FRANK, IS THIS REALLY
THE WAY YOU WANT TO BEHAVE

06:17.100 --> 06:18.533
IN FRONT OF
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER?

06:18.533 --> 06:20.800
- YOU KNOW, DEBRA,
FAR BE IT FROM ME

06:20.800 --> 06:22.333
TO EVER
TAKE HIS SIDE,

06:22.333 --> 06:24.033
BUT I DO THINK
IT'S HORRIBLE

06:24.033 --> 06:25.467
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO THAT STORE.

06:25.467 --> 06:27.733
THEY USED TO GIVE YOU
SAMPLES ALL THE TIME.

06:27.733 --> 06:31.233
AND THEY ALSO USED TO HELP YOU
TAKE YOUR BAGS TO THE CAR.

06:31.233 --> 06:34.700
- NOW I HAVE TO TAKE YOU
TO THE CAR MYSELF.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.667
- I WASON YOUR SIDE.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.367
- FRANK, STEALING IS ONLY
A PART OF THIS.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.900
WHY DID YOU HAVE
TO LOSE YOUR TEMPER

06:49.900 --> 06:51.167
AND THEN YELL
AT THE GUY?

06:51.167 --> 06:52.733
- HE WAS YELLING AT ME!

06:52.733 --> 06:55.400
- BUT THERE'S OTHER WAYS
TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.

06:55.400 --> 06:58.567
- HEY, YOU WEREN'T THERE.
THE GUY HAD IT COMING!

06:58.567 --> 07:00.900
- BUT NOT WITH
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER WATCHING.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.367
IT COULD AFFECT HER.

07:02.367 --> 07:05.267
I STILL TWITCH AT TOLLBOOTHS.

07:06.600 --> 07:09.400
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GLAD ALLY SAW THAT.

07:09.400 --> 07:12.533
SHE'S GOT TO LEARN YOU CAN'T
TAKE CRAP FROM PEOPLE!

07:14.200 --> 07:17.100
- FRANK...

07:17.100 --> 07:19.300
HAVE YOU EVER
HEARD THE SAYING,

07:19.300 --> 07:21.733
"IT TAKES A VILLAGE
TO RAISE A CHILD?"

07:21.733 --> 07:23.267
I BELIEVE THAT.

07:23.267 --> 07:25.567
AND I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE
A PART OF OUR VILLAGE.

07:25.567 --> 07:29.167
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO TEACH 'EM PROPER VALUES.

07:32.467 --> 07:33.933
- LISTEN, I DON'T KNOW

07:33.933 --> 07:37.267
WHAT THE HELL VILLAGE
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.733
BUT I LIVE
IN REAL WORLD, USA.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.600
SO YOU CAN SPARE ME
YOUR LECTURE.

07:44.600 --> 07:46.900
- WAIT, YOU LISTEN TO ME!
- COME WITH ME FOR A MINUTE.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.000
- SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE!
HE'S A PUBLIC MENACE!

07:49.000 --> 07:50.733
- I KNOW, I KNOW.

07:50.733 --> 07:54.067
- I THINK OUR VILLAGE
FOUND ITS IDIOT.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.133
WHY DIDN'T YOU
LET ME KILL HIM?

07:57.133 --> 07:59.633
- WELL, THAT WOULD BE
VERY NICE, DEAR.

07:59.633 --> 08:02.733
BUT THE TRUTH IS, THIS ALL
COULD'VE BEEN AVOIDED

08:02.733 --> 08:05.267
IF RAYMOND HAD HANDLED HIM
BETTER IN THE SUPERMARKET.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.633
- WHAT? WHAT?
HE WAS AN ANIMAL!

08:07.633 --> 08:11.633
- YES, AND YOULET HIM
OFF HIS LEASH.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.267
IF YOU TAKE A DOG
TO A SUPERMARKET,

08:16.267 --> 08:19.167
AND HE HAS AN ACCIDENT
IN THE FROZEN FOOD AISLE,

08:19.167 --> 08:21.067
IS IT THE DOG'S FAULT?

08:23.733 --> 08:26.333
- DID DAD EVER DO THAT?

08:30.167 --> 08:34.500
- I'M SAYING,
YOU KNOW HOW YOUR FATHER IS.

08:34.500 --> 08:38.000
AND THERE ARE WAYS TO PREVENT
THIS KIND OF SCENE.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.633
FIRST OF ALL,
I TRY TO BE WITH HIM

08:39.633 --> 08:43.667
IF HE'S EVER GOING TO BE
ANYWHERE THERE MIGHT BE PEOPLE.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.133
- BUT RAY WAS WITH HIM.

08:45.133 --> 08:46.533
WHAT WAS HE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

08:46.533 --> 08:49.533
- BEFORE YOU EVEN GOT
TO THE SNACK SECTION,

08:49.533 --> 08:52.333
YOU SHOULD'VE HAD
A HERSHEY BAR OR A ZAGNUT

08:52.333 --> 08:54.567
HERE IN YOUR POCKET.

08:54.567 --> 08:57.700
- THAT'S TRUE.
HE RESPONDS TO TREATS.

08:59.567 --> 09:01.667
- DO YOU KNOW WHY
THIS KIND OF THING

09:01.667 --> 09:03.700
DOESN'T HAPPEN
WHEN I'M AROUND?

09:03.700 --> 09:06.433
BECAUSE I COMPENSATE.

09:06.433 --> 09:10.233
HE'S HORRIBLE,
AND I HAVE A CERTAIN...

09:14.333 --> 09:15.800
- WELL,
THAT'S GREAT, MARIE.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.067
SO YOU WANT TO BE WITH HIM
ALL THE TIME, THEN?

09:18.067 --> 09:19.700
- UH, NO.

09:21.167 --> 09:22.367
- WELL, SOMEBODY NEEDS
TO STRAIGHTEN HIM OUT.

09:22.367 --> 09:23.367
- NO, NO, LEAVE HIM.

09:23.367 --> 09:24.833
HE'LL WATCH TELEVISION,

09:24.833 --> 09:27.267
THEN I'LL TAKE HIM HOME,
MAKE SOME CANNELLONI,

09:27.267 --> 09:30.333
HE'LL BURP,
AND HE'LL FEEL BETTER.

09:30.333 --> 09:32.800
- YOU'RE AN ENABLER.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.567
YOU'RE ACTUALLY REWARDING
HIS HORRIBLE BEHAVIOR

09:35.567 --> 09:38.033
WITH ITALIAN FOOD.

09:38.033 --> 09:41.167
- THAT'S EXACTLY
HOW THE MAFIA WORKS.

09:45.433 --> 09:46.967
- WELL, I'M GONNA
SPEAK TO HIM.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.900
- PUT SOME CANDY
IN YOUR POCKET!

09:49.900 --> 09:51.367
[thumping on stairs]

09:51.367 --> 09:53.667
- MOMMY, CAN YOU PLAY
TWISTER WITH US?

09:53.667 --> 09:55.533
- HEY, YEAH,
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, MOMMY.

09:55.533 --> 09:58.967
WE CAN ALL PLAY,
LIKE A HAPPY FAMILY.

09:58.967 --> 10:00.833
- TWISTER STINKS!

10:00.833 --> 10:02.567
HEY, KIDS, YOU WANT TO
WATCH SOMETHING FUNNY?

10:02.567 --> 10:03.567
SIT DOWN.

10:03.567 --> 10:06.767
"ABBOT AND COSTELLO
MEET THE MUMMY."

10:06.767 --> 10:08.400
HEY, ALLY, COME HERE.

10:09.600 --> 10:12.267
- MOM, MAY I PLEASE
GO PLAY COMPUTER?

10:12.267 --> 10:14.733
- UH, SURE, HONEY,
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

10:19.133 --> 10:21.400
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

10:21.400 --> 10:23.500
ALL OF A SUDDEN
I HAVE THE PLAGUE?

10:24.433 --> 10:26.733
WHAT DID YOU
SAY TO HER?

10:26.733 --> 10:29.733
- I DIDN'T SAY A WORD.
WANT SOME CANDY?

10:33.567 --> 10:36.500
- IF YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING,
THEN YOU DID.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.500
YOU BAD-MOUTHED ME,
DIDN'T YOU?

10:38.500 --> 10:39.667
- I DID NOT.

10:39.667 --> 10:42.133
WE TOLD YOU, ALLY HAD
SOME STRONG FEELINGS

10:42.133 --> 10:43.433
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

10:43.433 --> 10:45.600
- OH, WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.600
SHE JUST HAPPENS
TO BE FEELING

10:47.600 --> 10:50.700
THE SAME THING
THAT YOU TWO WERE THINKING.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.533
- MAYBE IT WAS WHAT
HER GRANDFATHER WAS DOING.

10:53.533 --> 10:55.900
- TURNING A KID
AGAINST HER GRANDPA.

10:55.900 --> 10:58.033
REAL CLASSY!

10:59.467 --> 11:01.400
- [sighs]

11:03.067 --> 11:06.200
- COULDN'T MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS?

11:08.300 --> 11:11.433
- THAT'S SOMETHING
TO WORK ON, DEBRA.

11:21.100 --> 11:24.233
- HEY.
- IT'S ALL SQUISHY!

11:28.033 --> 11:30.600
OH, HEY.

11:32.567 --> 11:34.433
WHAT'S UP?
I'M WORKING.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.433
- NOTHING.

11:36.433 --> 11:40.133
IS THE, UH...
GIRL AROUND?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.667
- ALLY?
- YEAH.

11:42.667 --> 11:44.533
- YEAH.

11:44.533 --> 11:47.300
THE GIRL'S IN THE BACKYARD.

11:47.300 --> 11:48.600
- LISTEN, I WAS THINKING

11:48.600 --> 11:50.900
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
A TALK WITH HER.

11:50.900 --> 11:51.900
- OH, YEAH?

11:51.900 --> 11:53.933
- YEAH.
I, UH...

11:53.933 --> 11:55.467
I WANT TO HAVE
A TALK WITH HER.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.300
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT, SO--
SO HAVE A TALK WITH HER.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.600
- NO BIG DEAL
OR ANYTHING.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.500
WHAT DO I
SAY TO HER?

12:06.500 --> 12:07.433
- WHAT?

12:07.433 --> 12:09.067
- WHAT DO I
SAY TO HER?

12:09.067 --> 12:11.433
I'VE NEVER
TALKED TO HER.

12:11.433 --> 12:14.567
- I THINK I'VE SEEN YOU
TALK TO HER.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.900
- NO.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.933
I'VE READ HER STORIES,
I'VE STOLEN HER NOSE,

12:17.933 --> 12:19.700
I'VE TOLD HER,
"HEY, GET DOWN FROM THERE!"

12:19.700 --> 12:21.567
BUT I'VE NEVER
TALKED TO HER.

12:21.567 --> 12:23.500
WHAT DO I DO?

12:25.600 --> 12:27.467
- UH, ALL RIGHT, JUST...

12:27.467 --> 12:29.367
YOU KNOW,
START KIND OF EASY.

12:29.367 --> 12:32.600
SAY SOMETHING NICE
OR START WITH A JOKE.

12:32.600 --> 12:36.667
YOU KNOW, AND THEN JUST SAY
WHAT YOU WANT TO...

12:36.667 --> 12:38.600
TO THE GIRL.

12:39.967 --> 12:41.733
- WHAT JOKE DO I TELL?

12:41.733 --> 12:43.433
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:43.433 --> 12:44.667
OKAY.

12:44.667 --> 12:46.767
WHAT DID THE BIG CHIMNEY
SAY TO THE LITTLE CHIMNEY?

12:46.767 --> 12:50.100
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO SMOKE.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.800
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.

12:53.800 --> 12:57.600
- IT'S A KIDS' JOKE.
- I'M NOT DOING THAT JOKE.

12:57.600 --> 12:58.867
- ALL RIGHT.

12:58.867 --> 13:00.567
DON'T DO A JOKE, THEN.
JUST TALK, ALL RIGHT?

13:00.567 --> 13:02.200
YOU DON'T GOT TO START
WITH ANYTHING.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.467
SHE KNOWS YOU.
YOU'RE GRANDPA.

13:04.467 --> 13:07.300
SHE'S FAMILIAR
WITH YOUR WORK.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.733
- ALL RIGHT.

13:16.267 --> 13:18.300
COME WITH ME.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.700
- NO.
WHAT ARE YOU SO SCARED OF?

13:20.700 --> 13:22.133
YOU WERE IN A WAR!

13:22.133 --> 13:25.600
- THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
THEY GAVE ME A RIFLE.

13:29.267 --> 13:32.400
- JUST GLAD
THEY TOOK IT BACK.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.200
- I'M GONNA GET YOU!
I'M GONNA GET YOU!

13:37.200 --> 13:40.333
- HEY, KIDS, WHAT,
ARE YOU PLAYING HERE?

13:40.333 --> 13:41.900
HEY, COME ON, BOYS.
GO INSIDE.

13:41.900 --> 13:44.500
YOUR DAD'S GOT CANDY AND
CHOCOLATE FUDGEY BALLS FOR YOU.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.133
GO ON INSIDE.

13:46.133 --> 13:48.567
HEY, ALLY, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

13:48.567 --> 13:50.433
- OKAY.

13:51.467 --> 13:53.567
- CAN WE, UH,
SIT SOMEWHERE?

14:04.067 --> 14:06.200
[metal buckling]

14:18.733 --> 14:22.433
OKAY, UH...

14:22.433 --> 14:25.267
SO, ALLY, WHAT DID
THE MEXICAN FIRE CHIEF

14:25.267 --> 14:27.733
NAME HIS TWO SONS?

14:28.833 --> 14:32.633
JOSE AND HOSE "B."

14:37.500 --> 14:41.133
THAT WAS ONE
OF YOUR FATHER'S JOKES.

14:42.233 --> 14:45.967
SO LISTEN, ALLY.
I, UH...

14:45.967 --> 14:47.533
I UNDERSTAND YOU WERE
MAD OR SOMETHING

14:47.533 --> 14:50.533
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE SUPERMARKET.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.400
BUT WHAT YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND IS THAT--

14:54.400 --> 14:56.567
- YOU TOOK THAT STUFF,

14:56.567 --> 14:58.933
AND THEN YOU YELLED
AT THAT MAN.

14:58.933 --> 15:01.067
IT WAS SCARY.

15:02.967 --> 15:05.533
- HEY, LISTEN...

15:05.533 --> 15:07.300
[metal buckling]

15:17.433 --> 15:20.767
YOU DON'T EVER NEED
TO BE SCARED OF ME.

15:20.767 --> 15:23.600
YOU SEE, WHAT I DID
WAS TAKE A LITTLE SAMPLE.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.667
AND THAT'S NOT STEALING.
IN FACT, THEY CALL IT SAMPLING.

15:26.667 --> 15:30.033
- BUT THE SIGN SAID
"NO SAMPLING."

15:31.867 --> 15:35.000
- OH, YOU'RE READING NOW.

15:39.167 --> 15:42.400
I'M PROUD OF YOU.
THAT'S GOOD.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.700
BUT, SEE, I THINK
THE SIGN IS WRONG.

15:46.700 --> 15:48.933
I THINK THEY SHOULD ALLOW
PEOPLE TO SAMPLE

15:48.933 --> 15:51.133
BECAUSE THAT WAY,
IF YOU TRY IT,

15:51.133 --> 15:52.933
YOU MIGHT
WANT TO BUY IT.

15:52.933 --> 15:56.800
BUT I COULD NEVER GET TO THAT
BECAUSE OF THAT JACK--

15:56.800 --> 15:58.733
MAN.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.200
- YOU WERE
YELLING AT HIM.

16:05.800 --> 16:07.200
- [sighs] LISTEN, ALLY,

16:07.200 --> 16:10.567
PEOPLE GET MAD
AT PEOPLE SOMETIMES.

16:10.567 --> 16:13.433
YOU GET MAD
AT PEOPLE SOMETIMES,

16:13.433 --> 16:15.767
LIKE YOUR LITTLE BROTHERS THERE.

16:15.767 --> 16:19.433
THEY MUST BE ANNOYING
AS HELL, AM I RIGHT?

16:22.200 --> 16:26.500
SO, ANYWAY, I MEAN,
WHEN THEY REALLY BOTHER YOU,

16:26.500 --> 16:30.767
YOU YELL AT THEM JUST THE WAY
I YELLED AT THE FRUIT GUY.

16:31.933 --> 16:33.167
YOU KNOW?

16:33.167 --> 16:35.467
BUT JUST BECAUSE
YOU YELL AT SOMEBODY,

16:35.467 --> 16:38.533
IT DOESN'T MEAN
YOU'RE A BAD PERSON.

16:38.533 --> 16:40.333
DOES IT?

16:44.067 --> 16:47.067
RIGHT.

16:47.833 --> 16:49.067
- BUT IF I DO THAT,

16:49.067 --> 16:51.600
THEN I HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE TO THEM.

17:02.800 --> 17:05.100
- NOT ALL OF THE TIME.

17:11.767 --> 17:14.100
- YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.133
- [sighs]

17:18.333 --> 17:19.967
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:19.967 --> 17:22.633
WHAT--
[makes honking noise]

17:22.633 --> 17:24.467
I GOT YOUR NOSE.

17:24.467 --> 17:26.333
BUT THAT'S NOT STEALING,
IT'S ONLY BORROWING,

17:26.333 --> 17:29.467
BECAUSE I'M GIVING IT BACK.

17:32.900 --> 17:35.900
THAT USED TO GET
A BIG LAUGH.

17:35.900 --> 17:38.600
YOU'RE TOO SMART
FOR THAT NOW.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.633
[sighs]

17:43.633 --> 17:46.333
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:46.333 --> 17:49.000
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.333
[groans]

17:55.600 --> 17:58.267
I'M NOT SO SCARY,
AM I?

17:59.300 --> 18:01.733
- NOT MORE THAN GRANDMA.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.733
THERE HE IS, GRANDPA.

18:17.733 --> 18:19.433
- YUP, THERE HE IS.

18:19.433 --> 18:22.033
GRAZING OVER
BY THE TOMATOES.

18:22.033 --> 18:23.400
- DAD.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.433
- ALL RIGHT, I'M WRONG.
HE'S SKINNY.

18:26.433 --> 18:27.733
- BE NICE.

18:27.733 --> 18:30.033
- GO AWAY.

18:34.567 --> 18:35.767
[clears throat]

18:35.767 --> 18:37.100
UH, EXCUSE ME.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.433
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU REMEMBER ME.

18:41.433 --> 18:44.633
I WAS IN HERE,
UH, LET'S SEE...

18:44.633 --> 18:47.167
THIS MORNING.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.067
- YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO NOW?

18:49.067 --> 18:51.533
PUT A TURKEY
DOWN YOUR PANTS?

18:51.533 --> 18:53.633
- [chuckling]

18:53.633 --> 18:54.967
NO.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.500
NO, I JUST WANT
TO STRAIGHTEN OUT

18:56.500 --> 18:59.000
A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING
ABOUT THE TRAIL MIX THERE.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.300
- YEAH, BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

19:00.300 --> 19:03.033
LOOK, I'M A LITTLE BUSY,
ALL RIGHT?

19:03.033 --> 19:04.233
- LISTEN, JIM,
I'M JUST TRYING

19:04.233 --> 19:05.700
TO STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

19:05.700 --> 19:07.767
- THERE'S NOTHING
TO STRAIGHTEN OUT.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.133
YOU TOOK SOME TRAIL MIX

19:09.133 --> 19:10.667
'CAUSE YOU'RE TOO CHEAP
TO PAY FOR IT,

19:10.667 --> 19:12.033
AND I CAUGHT YOU.

19:12.033 --> 19:14.500
I THINK WE'RE STRAIGHT.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.200
- I JUST WANT TO SAY
WE'RE BOTH GUYS, ALL RIGHT?

19:23.200 --> 19:24.600
AND WHATEVER HAPPENED
THIS MORNING

19:24.600 --> 19:28.133
WAS A LITTLE MISUNDERSTANDING,
AND I'M...

19:28.133 --> 19:29.600
SORRY.

19:33.200 --> 19:35.067
- YEAH, I'M SORRY TOO.

19:35.067 --> 19:37.500
I'M SORRY THAT JERKS LIKE YOU
COME INTO MY SECTION

19:37.500 --> 19:39.500
AND TAKE YOUR DIRTY HANDS
AND PUT IT INTO THE FOOD

19:39.500 --> 19:40.733
AND TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT.

19:40.733 --> 19:42.700
AND THEN WHEN I TRY
AND DO MY JOB,

19:42.700 --> 19:45.067
YOU SCREAM AND YELL
LIKE SOME RED-FACED MANIAC.

19:45.067 --> 19:46.367
YOU WANT TO DO ME A FAVOR?

19:46.367 --> 19:48.433
GO STEAL FROM THE A & P!

19:58.033 --> 20:01.167
- [breathing heavily]

20:17.167 --> 20:19.300
- GOOD JOB, DAD.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.467
- SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT GRANDPA

20:38.467 --> 20:42.700
SAT RIGHT HERE WITH YOU
AND HAD A CONVERSATION?

20:42.700 --> 20:43.900
- YES.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.100
- FOR HOW LONG?

20:45.100 --> 20:46.500
- I DON'T KNOW.

20:46.500 --> 20:49.433
- WELL, NO, WAS IT, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES, TEN?

20:49.433 --> 20:51.867
- I DON'T KNOW.
TEN, I GUESS.

20:51.867 --> 20:53.567
- TEN MINUTES?

20:53.567 --> 20:56.033
AND IT WASN'T
ABOUT FOOD?

20:56.967 --> 20:58.567
- NO, NOT REALLY.

20:58.567 --> 21:01.700
- YOU HAD A TEN-MINUTE
CONVERSATION WITH HIM.

21:03.167 --> 21:05.633
WHAT WAS THAT LIKE?

21:06.633 --> 21:08.367
- IT WAS OKAY, I GUESS.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.967
- AND YOU WEREN'T SCARED?

21:09.967 --> 21:13.100
- ROBBIE, YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA MOVE MY TRASH CANS FOR ME,

21:13.100 --> 21:14.300
AND YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.600
NOW THE GARBAGE MEN ARE HERE

21:15.600 --> 21:17.467
AND THE GARBAGE IS
SITTING IN THE BACK.

21:17.467 --> 21:21.100
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE TO DO IT
MYSELF LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE!

21:28.500 --> 21:31.633
- NOW, THAT ONE SCARES
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.
