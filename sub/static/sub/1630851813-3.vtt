11:15.536 --> 11:17.785
tonight at Side Step.

11:17.885 --> 11:19.875
Oh. (chuckles)
We'd all love it if your
family could-could join.

11:21.069 --> 11:22.761
There are games, uh...
(chuckles)

11:22.861 --> 11:24.552
chili of course.
Aw.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.536
Well, thank you, but I just...

11:27.637 --> 11:29.805
It-It's just good,
clean family fun.

11:29.905 --> 11:32.112
My mom is joining the chili
cook-off competition.

11:32.213 --> 11:33.507
She does every year.

11:33.607 --> 11:34.939
This year,

11:35.040 --> 11:37.208
the winner gets their recipe
on the Side Step menu.

11:37.308 --> 11:38.959
Huh.
Um...

11:39.060 --> 11:40.631
It'll be a good time, uh...

11:40.731 --> 11:44.333
You know what?
We'll be there.
Yeah?

11:44.433 --> 11:46.204
Yeah. Sounds like
a perfect opportunity

11:46.304 --> 11:47.218
for us to reestablish
ourselves.

11:47.299 --> 11:48.949
Great. Yeah.
Yeah.

11:49.050 --> 11:51.975
And-and I think I'll even
enter the cook-off.

11:52.074 --> 11:54.283
Yeah, give everyone
a run for their money. Right?

11:54.382 --> 11:55.318
Yeah?

11:55.418 --> 11:58.661
Yeah. I mean,

11:58.762 --> 12:00.174
entries are closed,
but I might know a guy

12:00.274 --> 12:01.885
with some connections.
Oh.

12:01.985 --> 12:03.915
All right. Thank you.

12:04.015 --> 12:05.944
Yeah. Uh, well, we'll
see y'all later.

12:06.045 --> 12:08.413
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

12:08.513 --> 12:11.239
Yeah, uh, Cordell.

12:11.338 --> 12:13.269
Yeah, you know, this, uh...

12:13.369 --> 12:16.294
This won't make up
for what you did.

12:16.394 --> 12:19.876
You know, I don't, I don't know
you, and you don't know me,

12:19.976 --> 12:22.324
but this family is
everything to me.

12:26.304 --> 12:28.653
Family is everything.

12:30.603 --> 12:32.593
So maybe you and I
aren't so different.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.667
Now we hurry up and wait.

12:53.766 --> 12:55.896
Do I have time to
finish my legal brief?

12:55.996 --> 12:58.006
Can you do it in six hours?
I don't know.

12:58.106 --> 13:00.871
Our new district attorney
demands thoroughness.

13:00.971 --> 13:03.338
You two are like
bathtubs and toasters.

13:03.439 --> 13:04.771
What?

13:04.872 --> 13:07.279
You don't mix.
Oh.

13:07.379 --> 13:09.588
So, is she, uh, is she going
to the Harvest Fest?

13:09.688 --> 13:11.617
No, thank God.

13:11.718 --> 13:14.285
She's down in Del Rio
wrapping up a case.

13:14.385 --> 13:16.275
All I'm saying is that,
you know,

13:16.375 --> 13:19.260
if you are no longer happy
at the D.A.'s office,

13:19.360 --> 13:21.369
maybe it's time for a change.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.598
(sighs)
Maybe you're right.

13:23.698 --> 13:25.946
On the other hand,
I've been shot,

13:26.045 --> 13:29.209
branded, nearly blown up.

13:29.310 --> 13:30.922
I didn't go through all that
to have Denise Davidson

13:31.021 --> 13:31.917
run me out of town.

13:32.016 --> 13:33.708
WALKER:
Smells good, Mama.

13:33.808 --> 13:35.459
Well, it would smell even better

13:35.559 --> 13:36.733
if you remembered
to bring the...
LIAM: Hey...

13:36.833 --> 13:39.519
Yeah, that's my boy.

13:39.619 --> 13:43.499
Hey, uh, uh...

13:43.598 --> 13:46.045
Gale Davidson has decided
to enter the cook-off.

13:46.146 --> 13:48.136
LIAM:
No.

13:49.052 --> 13:50.942
Why would she do that?
I invited her.

13:51.042 --> 13:53.050
Not on purpose.
I invited her

13:53.151 --> 13:54.882
to bring her family
to the Harvest Fest,

13:54.982 --> 13:58.186
and she decided she wants to
throw her chili in the ring.

13:58.286 --> 13:59.539
I mean, I'm sure
it'll be fine.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.524
Oh? No, it won't.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.911
The only thing that
Gale Davidson knows

14:05.012 --> 14:05.947
how to cook up is trouble,

14:06.047 --> 14:08.057
and she's only entering
to stir the pot.

14:08.156 --> 14:10.803
(chuckles,
clears throat)

14:10.903 --> 14:12.275
All I'm saying

14:12.375 --> 14:14.584
is that she has always
blamed you

14:14.684 --> 14:15.977
for her husband's death.

14:16.077 --> 14:17.967
And-and contrary to
popular belief, I do not

14:18.067 --> 14:19.559
hate her family.
I mean, hell,

14:19.659 --> 14:22.345
I still place flowers
on Marv's grave.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.534
But that does not mean
that I will allow her

14:24.634 --> 14:26.206
to go after my boy again.

14:26.305 --> 14:27.718
And so help me God, Cordi...

14:27.819 --> 14:29.112
She won't. She won't,
Mama, she won't.

14:29.212 --> 14:30.742
I'll see to it.

14:30.843 --> 14:33.829
Well, I hope you do, son.
Or I will.

14:36.734 --> 14:38.804
Guess we got ourselves
a competition.

14:52.694 --> 14:54.305
Trey!
Hey.

14:54.406 --> 14:56.415
Hey, for both our sake,

14:56.515 --> 14:58.485
I hope you got
my mama's brisket.

14:58.584 --> 15:00.356
That I did.
My man. Thank you.

15:00.456 --> 15:01.510
Yeah, of course.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.505
Ooh, toasty.
It's hot.

15:02.605 --> 15:03.500
Yeah, it is.

15:03.600 --> 15:06.525
Uh, hey, um...
(clears throat)

15:06.625 --> 15:08.435
Can I ask you about Micki?

15:08.536 --> 15:10.067
Yeah. Of course.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.156
Uh, anything.

15:12.992 --> 15:15.002
What's up?

15:15.103 --> 15:16.713
Do you know why she
hasn't come home yet?

15:16.814 --> 15:19.141
Well, it-it's only been a day.

15:19.242 --> 15:22.127
She's got to debrief,
paperwork and, uh...

15:22.227 --> 15:23.161
Yeah. No, no, no.

15:23.262 --> 15:25.789
Of course.
I, I get it.

15:25.889 --> 15:27.858
Um, you know, is there something

15:27.959 --> 15:29.848
I need to be worried about?
No.

15:29.949 --> 15:32.276
You know, being undercover
is a different beast.

15:32.377 --> 15:35.103
It-it takes a-a second
to, to shake that, you know.

15:35.203 --> 15:36.734
Yeah.
Totally normal.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.685
Look, I-I hear that.

15:38.785 --> 15:40.276
I just...

15:40.377 --> 15:43.779
When we came back from
our last deployment, Micki...

15:43.879 --> 15:45.212
(laughs)

15:45.312 --> 15:47.600
Micki made us go
directly from the hangar

15:47.699 --> 15:48.914
to the nearest Tex-Mex.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.266
(Walker laughs)

15:50.367 --> 15:52.257
Yeah, I believe that.
Yeah.

15:52.357 --> 15:53.511
But I-I hope you don't
think anything's wrong

15:53.591 --> 15:55.561
'cause she doesn't want tacos.
No, no, no.

15:55.661 --> 15:58.506
It's just, um, I know Micki.

15:58.606 --> 16:01.889
I think something
is bothering her

16:01.989 --> 16:03.978
beyond being undercover.

16:06.963 --> 16:08.894
Trey,

16:08.994 --> 16:11.838
I would really love to be
your wingman on this.

16:11.939 --> 16:14.665
You know I would,
but... it's not my place.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.968
Here, I think you two
should talk.

16:18.069 --> 16:20.357
You know, maybe someplace
with food.

16:20.457 --> 16:22.983
Maybe chili,
and-and maybe someplace

16:23.084 --> 16:25.252
with family and friends,
like the Walker family.

16:25.353 --> 16:27.521
You mean the festival.
I mean the festival.

16:27.621 --> 16:30.108
Uh, hey, I got to stop by
Ranger headquarters on the way,

16:30.208 --> 16:31.939
so I'll float the idea
to Micki,

16:32.039 --> 16:33.850
and, yeah,
I'll-I'll guilt-trip her

16:33.949 --> 16:35.880
about missing
Mawline's famous dish.

16:35.980 --> 16:37.711
Whoa, you-you think
that's a good idea?

16:37.811 --> 16:39.900
I think it's worth a shot.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.770
All right.
All right. Hey, thank you.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.980
I appreciate you, thank you.
I appreciate you.

16:49.751 --> 16:51.959
Good news.

16:52.059 --> 16:53.790
We may have a new buyer
who hates the Walkers

16:53.890 --> 16:54.905
as much as Serano does.

16:55.005 --> 16:57.850
This interested party
give a price?

16:57.949 --> 16:59.680
Oh, yeah. A high one, too.

16:59.781 --> 17:00.994
How high?

17:01.093 --> 17:02.665
Let's just say
they want to ensure

17:02.766 --> 17:04.815
that the surveillance op
continues.

17:04.914 --> 17:06.904
I set up a meeting
for tonight.

17:13.314 --> 17:15.541
Glad you convinced me to stay.

17:18.209 --> 17:22.327
Only, there's just
one problem.

17:22.428 --> 17:24.696
Don't know what that could be.

17:35.921 --> 17:38.606
Micki.
Or, uh, Ranger Ramirez.

17:38.707 --> 17:40.159
Hi.

17:40.259 --> 17:41.632
How's the report coming along?

17:41.731 --> 17:44.458
Slow.
Good. Great.

17:44.558 --> 17:46.249
Uh, not-not good, not great.

17:46.348 --> 17:48.438
It sucks. I'm sorry.

17:48.538 --> 17:49.672
Uh, but don't fret.

17:49.771 --> 17:51.662
Fret?
Indeed.

17:51.761 --> 17:54.327
Do not. For I have
come to save you

17:54.429 --> 17:55.324
from your writer's block.

17:55.424 --> 17:57.512
Uh...
Whoa...

17:57.613 --> 17:59.223
Why don't you come
join everyone

17:59.324 --> 18:02.049
at the Harvest Festival
and Chili Cook-Off... today?

18:02.150 --> 18:04.597
Uh, it's good eating,
and you know,

18:04.696 --> 18:08.020
the picadillo
waits for no one.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.328
(chuckles)
Whoa, you truly
are a gringo.

18:10.429 --> 18:12.558
Hmm?
It's picadillo.

18:12.657 --> 18:14.747
Yeah, that's what I said.
Hmm?

18:14.847 --> 18:17.135
Um, you know,
Trey's gonna be there and...

18:17.234 --> 18:19.204
Ah, there it is.

18:19.305 --> 18:20.757
What is?
That.

18:20.856 --> 18:22.348
That what?
Don't do that.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.538
Don't do what?
Don't act like your invite
is anything more

18:24.637 --> 18:25.613
than you meddling.

18:25.712 --> 18:28.915
Uh, I hate it
when you're right.

18:29.016 --> 18:31.861
Um, okay.

18:31.961 --> 18:33.613
Uh, I want to be honest.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.955
Um, I-I probably know
more than anyone

18:37.056 --> 18:39.066
what you're going through
right now.

18:39.165 --> 18:42.727
You know, Yvette and Duke.

18:42.827 --> 18:44.996
You go undercover,
and then, when you come back,

18:45.096 --> 18:48.976
the mission's completed,
but it doesn't make the loss

18:49.076 --> 18:51.125
any easier.

18:51.224 --> 18:54.787
And I kind of have a...

18:54.886 --> 18:56.976
sense of that,

18:57.076 --> 18:59.204
but please--

18:59.305 --> 19:01.751
I speak from experience here--

19:01.852 --> 19:02.946
don't blame yourself.

19:03.047 --> 19:05.016
Do not blame yourself.

19:05.116 --> 19:07.463
Because then you'll lose sight
of who you are.

19:12.201 --> 19:13.892
I hate it when you're right.

19:13.991 --> 19:15.882
Doesn't happen often.

19:15.981 --> 19:17.275
You know, a broken clock
is right twice a day.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.365
You know what I mean?

19:23.306 --> 19:25.673
I'll, uh, see you
at the chili cook-off.

19:25.772 --> 19:27.762
Yeah.

19:37.474 --> 19:39.523
WOMAN:
You're gonna miss!
(bell rings)

19:39.624 --> 19:43.385
Oh-ho-ho!
That's a shot. Look at that.

19:43.484 --> 19:44.977
(indistinct chatter)
How you guys doing?

19:45.077 --> 19:45.972
All right, man, cool.

19:46.072 --> 19:47.285
All right, have a good time.

19:47.385 --> 19:49.195
GERI:

Hey.

20:52.700 --> 20:55.465
For you, ma'am.
Mawline's very own.

20:55.566 --> 20:57.575
Uh, because you shouldn't
be doing anything

20:57.674 --> 20:59.525
other than eating right now.

20:59.625 --> 21:02.152
Someone's got to keep
the whiskey flowing, right?

21:02.251 --> 21:03.146
Here you go.
Fair enough.

21:03.247 --> 21:05.018
I'll drink to that.

21:05.117 --> 21:07.048
Cheers.
Cheers.

21:07.147 --> 21:10.073
Wow, that is a big bowl
of chili. Want to share?

21:10.173 --> 21:11.904
Love to, uh, but I can't.

21:12.003 --> 21:14.371
As the judge, I have to
blind-taste the final two.

21:14.471 --> 21:16.559
Oh. Got it. All right.
Well, then, I will eat,

21:16.660 --> 21:18.750
as you suggested,
and you talk.

21:18.849 --> 21:21.277
Sounds like every date
Em and I ever went on.

21:22.868 --> 21:25.117

(microphone feedback)
Here we go. Ooh!

33:46.646 --> 33:48.815
Okay.

33:48.914 --> 33:51.084
Ah, I would like
to thank my opponent

33:51.183 --> 33:54.189
for making this such
a stiff competition.

33:54.289 --> 33:55.223
Yeah, right there.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.612
(cheers and applause)

33:57.712 --> 34:00.796
I would also like to thank
the Walker family as a whole.

34:00.895 --> 34:05.452
Truth is, you are the reason
I stand before you tonight.

34:05.553 --> 34:07.363
You know, when my late husband
Marvin was taken from us

34:07.462 --> 34:10.268
and, um, we had to leave town,

34:10.368 --> 34:15.681
I, uh... I never thought
I'd see Austin again.

34:15.782 --> 34:17.114
My life stopped
for a minute there,

34:17.214 --> 34:18.667
but here we are.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.896
A grand return
if I do say so myself.

34:20.996 --> 34:23.123
(cheers and applause)
Yeah. Oh, thank you.

34:23.224 --> 34:25.274
Uh...

34:25.373 --> 34:27.582
and so, um,
in the spirit of giving,

34:27.681 --> 34:30.567
our family has decided
to reinvest our winnings

34:30.667 --> 34:34.228
back into the community
by building a horse rescue

34:34.329 --> 34:39.045
for any beautiful stallion
or strong mare

34:39.145 --> 34:40.199
in need of a home.

34:40.299 --> 34:42.707
Yeah. Yeah.

34:42.806 --> 34:45.413
Thank you.
My grandson has single-handedly

34:45.513 --> 34:46.806
been caring for a wounded horse.

34:46.906 --> 34:49.971
I-I have no idea what
she's talking about.

34:52.837 --> 34:54.608
At least the horse
found a home.

34:54.708 --> 34:57.951
Right. It's what we wanted.

34:58.051 --> 34:59.264
Where others have turned
this animal away,

34:59.364 --> 35:01.573
we will see that
it is delivered to the rescue

35:01.672 --> 35:04.120
and sheltered for
the rest of its days.

35:04.219 --> 35:05.951
(cheers and applause)

35:06.051 --> 35:08.041
Thank you.

35:11.146 --> 35:12.677
Now that the Davidsons
are back,

35:12.777 --> 35:16.697
I promise you we will not
fault this city.

35:16.797 --> 35:19.643
Thank you.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.733
(cheers and applause)

35:34.668 --> 35:36.121
Mama.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.504
So, Gale won, huh?

35:39.603 --> 35:40.186
Yeah.

35:40.196 --> 35:42.802
I know you handed her the win.

35:42.902 --> 35:45.469
I just want to know why.

35:45.569 --> 35:47.897
(sighs)
It was the,

35:47.996 --> 35:49.688
it was the right thing to do.

35:49.788 --> 35:51.638
I mean, the Davidsons,
they, uh,

35:51.737 --> 35:55.300
lost everything

35:55.400 --> 35:57.967
because of that night.

35:58.067 --> 36:00.672
You know, Gale lost her husband.

36:00.773 --> 36:02.743
Uh, Denise lost her father.

36:02.842 --> 36:04.614
Cordell...

36:04.714 --> 36:08.036
The-the-the loss,
the-the-the pain that it...

36:08.136 --> 36:10.862
It-it cuts you so deep.

36:10.962 --> 36:14.166
It makes you sick.

36:14.266 --> 36:17.150
It's something you can't
really understand

36:17.251 --> 36:19.858
if, uh, if you haven't
experienced it.

36:19.958 --> 36:24.435
But their losses
didn't stop that night.

36:24.534 --> 36:26.146
You know,
their financial troubles.

36:26.246 --> 36:28.136
Or-or their legal problems.

36:28.236 --> 36:32.036
And-and everyone
took our side, Mama. Everyone.

36:32.137 --> 36:34.505
So even if you can put aside
the-the public humiliation

36:34.605 --> 36:35.737
a-and shame,

36:35.838 --> 36:38.724
they lost Marv.

36:38.824 --> 36:40.793
And they lost their friends,

36:40.893 --> 36:43.777
they lost their home,
their-their land.

36:43.878 --> 36:45.928
And here we come,

36:46.027 --> 36:49.231
swooping up their real estate
for pennies on the dollar.

36:49.331 --> 36:51.540
So then, they have to leave town

36:51.640 --> 36:54.167
with a, with a dark cloud
of shame

36:54.266 --> 36:56.117
and grief hanging
over their heads.

36:56.217 --> 36:57.708
I'm starting to think
that maybe, uh...

36:57.809 --> 37:00.415
you know, maybe-maybe
we're the bad guys.

37:00.515 --> 37:02.087
It was complicated back then.

37:02.187 --> 37:03.918
I know. I get it,
yeah. It was.

37:04.018 --> 37:06.585
But it's not now.
It's really not.

37:06.685 --> 37:08.675
These, uh...

37:10.187 --> 37:13.152
...these nightmares
I've been having,

37:13.252 --> 37:14.625
they're-they're...

37:14.725 --> 37:16.534
they're more than that.

37:16.635 --> 37:20.315
They're memories.

37:20.416 --> 37:22.406
I remember...

37:24.118 --> 37:27.420
...taking a lantern
into the barn...

37:29.650 --> 37:31.938
...and leaving it there.

37:32.038 --> 37:33.728
I know I did.

37:33.829 --> 37:35.819
I know I did it.

37:36.813 --> 37:40.534
So, the fire, the barn,

37:40.635 --> 37:42.625
Marv's death.

37:46.924 --> 37:48.496
It's my fault.

37:48.596 --> 37:50.585
No, baby.
