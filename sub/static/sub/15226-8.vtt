01:23.982 --> 01:26.484
Elaine, Elaine, I don't think
        we should be doing this.

01:26.519 --> 01:29.221
Oh, no. Come on, Alex.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.456
This may be our only chance
to meet Craig Eagen.

01:31.491 --> 01:32.924
You said
you loved his paintings.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.826
You said you wanted
to meet him.

01:34.860 --> 01:35.627
I know. I said that before.

01:35.661 --> 01:36.961
You told me
    he was a total recluse.

01:36.995 --> 01:38.029
Oh, those are just stories.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.064
I'm sure they're exaggerated.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.134
CRAIG:
Whoever you are, go away!

01:42.168 --> 01:43.468
That was fun.
      Thank you very much.

01:43.502 --> 01:44.635
Let's go.
No, come on.

01:44.670 --> 01:47.005
Uh, Mr. Eagen, it's Elaine Nardo
and Alex Reiger.

01:47.039 --> 01:48.940
I'm from the Hazeltine Gallery.

01:48.975 --> 01:51.776
I brought the painting
for you to authenticate.

01:51.810 --> 01:54.645
CRAIG:
Oh, yeah, well, just
leave it there in the hallway

01:54.680 --> 01:56.314
and pick it up
tomorrow, okay?

01:58.884 --> 02:02.019
Um, Mr. Eagen, we really need
    to know this right away.

02:02.054 --> 02:03.855
Uh, do you think you could just

02:03.889 --> 02:06.057
open the door
    a crack and take a look?

02:06.091 --> 02:08.660
CRAIG:
Oh. No, I-I couldn't
do that at all, no.

02:08.693 --> 02:11.062
I have a... an extremely
vicious dog in here.

02:11.096 --> 02:13.631
(growling, barking,
        glass clinking)

02:13.665 --> 02:15.066
(fabric tearing)

02:15.100 --> 02:16.367
Go to your place!

02:16.401 --> 02:18.837
(dog whimpering)

02:18.871 --> 02:21.005
Let's forget it.

02:21.039 --> 02:23.141
No, no, no. Come on,
      we've come this far.

02:23.175 --> 02:25.610
Uh, Mr. Eagen, I-I realize

02:25.644 --> 02:27.245
that you're a very
        private person,

02:27.280 --> 02:29.080
but this'll only take a minute.

02:29.114 --> 02:32.250
Mr. Eagen, we're big fans
        of yours.

02:32.284 --> 02:34.419
(loud clattering)

02:35.855 --> 02:38.589
(footsteps running)

02:44.596 --> 02:46.764
Hello?

02:49.068 --> 02:50.334
ELAINE:
Where is he?

02:57.276 --> 02:59.277
Hello?

03:02.748 --> 03:04.682
Maybe that's him.

03:06.918 --> 03:09.153
Where's your dog?

03:11.690 --> 03:14.125
Uh... I have a, uh,

03:14.159 --> 03:15.960
confession to make.

03:15.995 --> 03:17.095
ALEX:
              Well, what's that?

03:17.129 --> 03:20.431
(growling and barking)

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
Craig, go to your spot.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.302
(whimpering)

03:24.336 --> 03:26.104
I see.

03:27.673 --> 03:30.041
So, is that the, uh,
         the painting?

03:30.075 --> 03:31.142
Uh, yes, it is.

03:31.177 --> 03:32.343
(clears throat)

03:37.349 --> 03:39.217
Yeah, that's, that's mine,
          that's mine.

03:39.251 --> 03:42.520
Say, you know why
  I recognize this apartment?

03:42.554 --> 03:44.088
You've painted
            this whole apartment

03:44.123 --> 03:45.790
in bits and pieces.

03:45.825 --> 03:47.492
I-I recognize
                     this chair.

03:47.526 --> 03:48.759
I saw the paint...
Oh.

03:48.794 --> 03:51.296
You painted this
                 table. I, um...

03:51.330 --> 03:52.831
Oh, hey, listen,
                      I'm sorry.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.333
I, uh... I guess
             I'm making you feel
             uncomfortable, huh?

03:55.367 --> 03:57.369
Oh, no. No.
No, not at all.

03:59.905 --> 04:02.240
Oh, well, I think
        we'd better go.

04:03.308 --> 04:04.743
Come on, Elaine.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.177
Here you are.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.578
Thank you very much.

04:07.612 --> 04:08.947
You know, I can't tell you

04:08.981 --> 04:10.948
what a pleasure it is
          to meet you.

04:10.983 --> 04:12.650
I... I think you're a genius.

04:12.684 --> 04:14.252
Ah. Oh. Oh.

04:14.286 --> 04:15.854
Anyway, you know, I, uh...

04:15.888 --> 04:18.822
Frankly, I don't... I don't have
  a lot of visitors, you know,

04:18.857 --> 04:20.491
and, uh, I know
       I should probably

04:20.524 --> 04:21.858
offer you some coffee, and...

04:21.892 --> 04:23.027
Oh, that'd be nice.

04:23.062 --> 04:24.328
CRAIG:
But I... No,
unfortunately, I've just...

04:24.363 --> 04:25.797
I just don't have
any coffee, you know.

04:25.831 --> 04:26.965
Oh. Okay.

04:26.999 --> 04:28.232
Elaine, let's go.

04:28.266 --> 04:30.401
Stay where you are.
You know,

04:30.435 --> 04:32.137
how would you like
   to go out for some coffee?

04:32.171 --> 04:33.038
Oh, yeah, that sounds great.

04:33.072 --> 04:34.339
Well...
I'd love it.

04:34.373 --> 04:35.540
Okay, great.
     I'll put the water on,

04:35.574 --> 04:37.942
and you go down
   and get the coffee, okay?

04:37.976 --> 04:40.845
Oh, I thought you were
inviting us out for coffee.

04:40.879 --> 04:42.080
Out? No, no, no.

04:42.114 --> 04:43.414
Well, I-I guess I-I should...

04:43.448 --> 04:44.848
I should... I should tell you

04:44.883 --> 04:46.551
that, uh, I'm, uh...
        I'm agoraphobic.

04:46.585 --> 04:48.620
Oh. I don't know
what that means.

04:48.654 --> 04:50.822
I do.

04:50.856 --> 04:53.191
Yes, Alex?
                           ALEX:
                             Ah.

04:53.225 --> 04:54.592
It means you're
              afraid of heights.

04:54.626 --> 04:55.993
No, no, that's acrophobia.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.997
I have that a little bit, too,

04:59.031 --> 05:00.765
but not-not quite as severe
        as agoraphobia.

05:00.799 --> 05:02.901
Agoraphobia means-- especially
    in my particular case--

05:02.935 --> 05:05.837
it means I have total terror
     of leaving my studio.

05:05.871 --> 05:07.605
I thought that
                was Anglophobia.

05:07.639 --> 05:08.639
No, no, no.

05:08.673 --> 05:10.008
That's fear
of England.

05:10.042 --> 05:11.276
Yeah.

05:11.310 --> 05:14.278
Yeah, I have... I have...
I have sort of just a whisper

05:14.312 --> 05:15.446
of that myself, but...

05:15.481 --> 05:17.048
not as severe
as the other stuff.

05:17.082 --> 05:18.315
I mean, for instance,

05:18.350 --> 05:22.354
the name Alistair Cooke
gives me the shivers.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.422
So, wait. If you're afraid
     to leave your studio,

05:25.457 --> 05:27.725
what do you do when you go out?

05:27.759 --> 05:29.894
I just don't go out.

05:33.799 --> 05:36.534
What is it that you're afraid
will happen if you go out there?

05:36.568 --> 05:37.768
Oh, it's... That's...

05:37.803 --> 05:39.103
It's so difficult to explain.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.906
It would take a very long time.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.107
Well, try.

05:43.141 --> 05:44.442
Elaine, Elaine.

05:44.476 --> 05:46.010
Hey, uh, you'd probably
be happier

05:46.044 --> 05:47.879
if we left you alone,
wouldn't you?

05:47.913 --> 05:50.147
Yeah, I would.

05:50.182 --> 05:52.183
Yeah. Thanks for understanding.

05:52.217 --> 05:53.284
Okay. Come on, Elaine.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.685
I'm not leaving.

05:54.719 --> 05:56.788
Elaine, the man
             wants you to leave.

05:56.822 --> 05:58.623
He wants help. Look at him.

05:58.657 --> 06:01.593
Elaine. Elaine, now look,
  this is out of your league.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.561
That man is damn near psychotic.

06:03.595 --> 06:04.462
Uh, no offense.

06:04.496 --> 06:05.296
None taken.

06:05.330 --> 06:06.430
Look, Elaine,

06:06.465 --> 06:07.665
I'm gonna leave.

06:07.699 --> 06:09.100
Okay, go.

06:09.134 --> 06:11.102
It was nice to
            meet you, Mr. Eagen.

06:11.136 --> 06:13.838
Oh. Oh, it was very nice
meeting you, Mr. Reiger.

06:13.872 --> 06:15.173
I'm going.

06:15.207 --> 06:17.442
Fine.
         (door closes)

06:23.315 --> 06:26.217
Um, I'm sorry about that. Um...

06:28.286 --> 06:29.987
Do you want me to leave?

06:31.990 --> 06:34.725
I... I don't know.

06:34.759 --> 06:36.961
See, I didn't mean
              to intrude on you.

06:36.995 --> 06:39.164
I... Oh, I'm sorry.

06:39.198 --> 06:40.297
No. That's okay.

06:40.332 --> 06:43.768
I'm, I'm not genophobic.

06:43.802 --> 06:46.838
That means
 you have no fear of touching?

06:46.872 --> 06:50.308
No, it means
     I have no fear of sex.

06:50.342 --> 06:53.811
As long as it's right here,
    right now, pronto, see?

06:53.846 --> 06:55.246
Oh.

06:55.280 --> 06:57.581
I'm just kidding.

07:02.487 --> 07:04.889
See...

07:04.923 --> 07:07.758
I just can't believe

07:07.792 --> 07:10.928
that somebody
 like you can't just, you know,

07:10.963 --> 07:15.933
walk through that door,
 and-and-and take a drive or...

07:15.968 --> 07:17.569
God, go to a museum.

07:17.603 --> 07:18.702
No, there's nothing...

07:18.737 --> 07:20.371
There's nothing depressing
        about it at all.

07:20.405 --> 07:22.473
No?
No, I have
a wonderful life here.

07:22.507 --> 07:23.607
I have everything I want.

07:23.642 --> 07:26.144
I got practically two
of everything I want, actually.

07:26.178 --> 07:28.513
You got a real ark, huh?

07:28.547 --> 07:29.714
Okay.

07:29.748 --> 07:31.883
That's nice. I like that.

07:31.917 --> 07:33.717
Have you always been like this?

07:33.752 --> 07:35.219
No?
No, uh-uh, no.

07:35.253 --> 07:36.988
As a kid, I was afraid of
 all the sort of normal things.

07:37.022 --> 07:38.389
You know?
                       I'm still
                      listening.

07:38.423 --> 07:39.757
Like, I was afraid of the dark,
and lightning...

07:39.791 --> 07:41.559
How about the hallway?
And loud noises
and fish.

07:41.593 --> 07:42.627
But I don't know.

07:42.661 --> 07:44.262
As I got older, I started

07:44.296 --> 07:45.863
getting more afraid
of more things.

07:45.897 --> 07:47.831
Let me help you.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.638
Many have tried.

07:53.672 --> 07:54.939
(laughs)

08:17.228 --> 08:19.030
Come on, just
the hallway?

08:19.064 --> 08:20.364
Just one step?

08:20.398 --> 08:23.034
I'm right here.

08:25.804 --> 08:26.737
We did it!
                    Oh.

08:26.771 --> 08:28.005
I don't believe it!

08:28.039 --> 08:29.707
I don't believe it!
You did it, Craig.

08:29.742 --> 08:31.408
I'm gonna do it
               again, all right?
    Okay.

08:31.443 --> 08:33.644
All right, I'm gonna do it
    again. All right, all right.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.446
I'm gonna do it
              myself, all right?
Fine.

08:35.480 --> 08:36.813
You don't mind?
          No offense.
No.

08:36.847 --> 08:37.615
(laughs)

08:37.649 --> 08:38.683
I did it again!
        I did it again!

08:38.717 --> 08:40.049
Oh, Craig,
that's wonderful!

08:40.085 --> 08:41.852
I'm gonna do it with my eyes
     closed now, all right?

08:41.886 --> 08:42.986
Oh, okay.
        Okay, now watch.

08:43.020 --> 08:44.255
Is this the door?
           God. Okay.

08:44.289 --> 08:45.556
Ah. How do you like that?

08:45.590 --> 08:46.958
I loved it.
                      All right.

08:46.992 --> 08:49.026
Now one for the tango.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.995
Yeah, I'm really
                    cooking now.

08:51.029 --> 08:53.130
Oh, God, I can't wait
till I tell Alex.

08:58.871 --> 09:02.006
Oh, Alex,
I got to talk to you.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.775
Well, if it isn't Nurse Ratched.

09:04.809 --> 09:06.811
What are you doing here?

09:06.845 --> 09:08.879
Who's watching
     little cuckoo's nest?

09:08.913 --> 09:09.980
(laughing):
            Oh, you.

09:10.015 --> 09:12.383
Listen, I got to tell you
what's going on.

09:12.417 --> 09:13.584
I mean...
                    (gasps)

09:13.618 --> 09:15.285
I used to be
                hard of hearing,

09:15.320 --> 09:17.722
but now that you touched
           me, I can hear again.

09:17.756 --> 09:19.190
She's doing it
                   again, folks.

09:19.224 --> 09:21.859
I love my cage.

09:21.893 --> 09:24.695
I think of it as a window
         on the world.

09:24.729 --> 09:26.631
Come here, Jeff.

09:26.665 --> 09:29.567
There seems to be another
     interesting tale unfolding.

09:30.568 --> 09:33.504
Alex walks away
                    from Elaine.

09:33.538 --> 09:35.640
Elaine follows.

09:35.674 --> 09:38.108
Could there
                   be a problem?

09:38.143 --> 09:41.445
Alex, I am making amazing
            progress with Craig.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.581
Yes, and he's making
amazing progress with you.

09:43.615 --> 09:45.549
Now you're both nuts.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.185
Why?

09:47.219 --> 09:48.219
Why?
                           Yeah.

09:48.253 --> 09:49.554
Why don't you get this man
to a qualified doctor?

09:49.588 --> 09:50.888
That's why.
                           Okay.

09:50.922 --> 09:52.323
Yeah, there must be some doctor

09:52.357 --> 09:53.591
who specializes in...

09:53.625 --> 09:55.093
(sputtering)

09:56.395 --> 09:57.962
Sorry for interrupting.

09:57.996 --> 09:59.463
She turns.

09:59.497 --> 10:01.432
Louie!

10:03.135 --> 10:05.236
He walks to his
                    mailbox now.

10:05.270 --> 10:06.370
Oh.
                         Mm-hmm.

10:06.404 --> 10:07.938
On command?

10:07.972 --> 10:08.906
Would you listen?

10:08.940 --> 10:10.875
And we had lunch
             on the fire escape.

10:10.909 --> 10:12.043
Mm-hmm.

10:12.077 --> 10:13.711
And he went inside
                 of an elevator.

10:13.745 --> 10:14.878
Wow.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.514
It is so thrilling
                      to see him

10:16.548 --> 10:17.949
actually considering
      coming out into the world.

10:17.983 --> 10:20.051
And I figured
               out how to do it.

10:20.085 --> 10:24.055
See, he has agreed
             to get into my cab,

10:24.089 --> 10:27.358
and so I thought that
         I would bring him here.

10:27.392 --> 10:29.093
Oh, Elaine, for
                crying out loud.

10:29.127 --> 10:30.428
No! Alex,

10:30.462 --> 10:31.729
it's perfect.

10:31.763 --> 10:33.564
I told him
all about the guys,

10:33.598 --> 10:35.166
and the guys know all about him,

10:35.200 --> 10:36.800
and it's like
     he knows them already,

10:36.835 --> 10:40.038
so no one will seem strange
            to him.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.705
Just my luck.

10:41.740 --> 10:43.674
Nothing to
                     throw away.

10:50.115 --> 10:52.349
Elaine, for some strange
  reason-- I don't know why--

10:52.384 --> 10:54.118
I don't think
      that's a great idea.

10:54.152 --> 10:55.586
Besides, if you
                 make a mistake,

10:55.620 --> 10:57.121
you're never going
            to forgive yourself.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.156
You may do irreparable damage
          to that man.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.357
You don't fool around

11:00.392 --> 11:02.460
with this stuff
 unless you're trained. Period.

11:02.494 --> 11:06.464
Oh, Alex, don't you think I know
what you're talking about?

11:06.498 --> 11:07.899
And if you keep this up,

11:07.933 --> 11:10.434
I'm going to start listening,
because I'm scared, too.

11:10.468 --> 11:13.136
But please don't take this
away from me.

11:13.171 --> 11:15.206
I feel so worthwhile.

11:15.240 --> 11:18.309
Please don't undermine
my confidences.

11:18.343 --> 11:19.910
Elaine...
Besides which,

11:19.944 --> 11:20.978
how do you think

11:21.012 --> 11:23.614
they cure people
of their phobias, huh?

11:23.649 --> 11:25.883
By carefully exposing them

11:25.918 --> 11:27.785
to the thing
that they're afraid of

11:27.787 --> 11:30.321
until their fear is gone.

11:30.355 --> 11:32.089
And that's exactly
what I'm doing.

11:32.124 --> 11:35.626
With love and care
and understanding.

11:35.660 --> 11:37.461
Nardo, help me.

11:37.495 --> 11:40.664
I got a phobia
      about getting naked.

11:41.633 --> 11:43.568
Louie, you'd better
                 behave yourself

11:43.602 --> 11:45.336
when Craig comes in here.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.338
Ooh, I love you!

11:47.372 --> 11:48.806
I'm bringing him tomorrow.

11:56.014 --> 11:57.548
Reiger, you still here?

11:57.582 --> 11:58.849
Yeah.

11:59.918 --> 12:01.818
What's the matter?

12:03.355 --> 12:05.155
I don't know,
     I just think that, uh,

12:05.190 --> 12:07.625
Elaine's making a mistake
       bringing him here.

12:10.529 --> 12:12.029
You mad at her?

12:12.063 --> 12:14.432
No, I'm scared, Louie.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.235
Whew.

12:21.673 --> 12:23.774
Hey, Reiger,

12:23.808 --> 12:25.909
(blowing, spitting)

12:28.180 --> 12:31.282
See this bottle?
                           Yeah?

12:31.316 --> 12:35.352
This is an expensive
    vintage wine that I got

12:35.387 --> 12:38.856
from one of my
      first fares in 1957.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.291
And I've been waiting

12:41.326 --> 12:43.895
for the right occasion
         to open it up.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.396
This sure ain't it.

12:46.898 --> 12:47.831
I wouldn't break out a bottle

12:47.865 --> 12:50.334
of Yoo-hoo for this one.

12:50.368 --> 12:52.336
But let's talk.

12:52.370 --> 12:55.105
I don't want to talk,
           I don't want to talk.

12:55.139 --> 12:58.776
No, no, listen, I,
I know what's wrong.

12:58.810 --> 13:00.611
You went against
your better judgment

13:00.645 --> 13:02.613
and you trusted Elaine.

13:02.647 --> 13:05.216
We've all trusted skirts.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.650
We've all paid.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.887
The man who gave me
          this bottle of wine...

13:10.922 --> 13:11.988
Listen to me, this'll,

13:12.023 --> 13:13.658
this'll get your
                    mind off it.

13:13.692 --> 13:16.460
The man who gave me
      this bottle of wine

13:16.494 --> 13:19.530
was a man that women loved.

13:19.564 --> 13:23.467
His name was Errol Flynn.

13:27.372 --> 13:29.407
Errol Flynn.

13:29.441 --> 13:31.442
Interested, huh?

13:31.476 --> 13:33.411
All right.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.682
I'm a rookie cab
driver, right?

13:38.717 --> 13:39.884
Errol Flynn

13:39.918 --> 13:44.822
gets into my cab
   with two beautiful women.

13:44.856 --> 13:46.657
Better than beautiful women.

13:46.691 --> 13:48.225
Cheap women.

13:49.961 --> 13:53.297
He's sitting back there with
  an arm around each of them.

13:53.331 --> 13:54.732
Right?

13:54.766 --> 13:57.234
Now, I got this problem
     because in those days,

13:57.269 --> 13:59.903
our rearview mirrors
        are only so big.

13:59.937 --> 14:02.205
My luck, I could only see him.

14:03.274 --> 14:06.477
But he was smiling, Reiger.

14:06.511 --> 14:08.779
Smiling from ear to ear.

14:08.813 --> 14:10.947
Ooh!

14:10.982 --> 14:13.584
The old swashbuckler
       was never happier.

14:13.618 --> 14:15.519
(smarmy laughter)

14:15.553 --> 14:17.989
All right.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.590
You should have
      seen these, Reiger.

14:19.624 --> 14:21.826
I can still smell

14:21.860 --> 14:23.628
their perfume.

14:23.662 --> 14:25.663
It was...

14:25.697 --> 14:27.932
Thick, you know?

14:27.966 --> 14:29.934
All right, he says to me,

14:29.968 --> 14:32.770
"Take me to the
Hotel Pierre, kid."

14:32.804 --> 14:34.205
So, I take him.

14:34.239 --> 14:38.576
We get there and he is
    totally passed out cold.

14:38.610 --> 14:41.212
Can't feel a thing.

14:41.246 --> 14:43.380
There's no doorman around.

14:43.415 --> 14:44.982
So, what could I do?

14:45.016 --> 14:46.984
Me and the two babes rolled him.

14:51.890 --> 14:55.959
He had $184,
a pirate knife

14:55.994 --> 14:58.696
and this bottle of wine.

14:58.730 --> 15:01.765
I was so thrilled, I was a kid.

15:01.799 --> 15:06.403
All the dames wanted
  was the knife and the wine.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.805
So, I took the $184.

15:08.840 --> 15:11.942
Then they put the knife
          to my throat

15:11.977 --> 15:15.012
and sold me the bottle
       of wine for $184.

15:17.849 --> 15:19.817
So, you see?

15:19.851 --> 15:24.921
Errol trusted women and lost.

15:24.956 --> 15:28.425
I trusted women and lost.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.827
What chance does
   an anteater like you have?

15:37.168 --> 15:39.636
Thank you, Louie.

15:46.578 --> 15:48.012
ELAINE:
       Now, don't worry.

15:48.046 --> 15:49.914
They might not even notice you.

15:59.857 --> 16:02.426
Hey, everyone,
              we have a visitor.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.529
Guys, I want you
      to meet Craig Eagen.

16:05.563 --> 16:07.631
Craig, I want you
       to meet the guys.

16:07.665 --> 16:09.333
(thud, lock clicks)

16:11.370 --> 16:13.904
Um, he locked the door.

16:13.938 --> 16:15.239
ALEX:
                         Mm-hmm.

16:15.273 --> 16:16.407
It's okay.

16:21.279 --> 16:22.480
I, I don't know,
    I really think I've done

16:22.514 --> 16:23.981
all I can for right now, okay?

16:24.015 --> 16:25.415
Oh, sure.
This is major.

16:25.449 --> 16:26.917
Craig, it's really okay.
Great.

16:26.951 --> 16:29.253
You know, why, why don't we
   just rest for a minute, okay?

16:29.287 --> 16:30.354
Great, all right, okay.

16:30.388 --> 16:31.989
JIM:
                           Psst.

16:32.023 --> 16:33.257
Psst, psst.

16:33.291 --> 16:35.226
Psst.

16:35.260 --> 16:36.660
What?

16:36.694 --> 16:39.162
Should we all rest
                    or just him?

16:42.266 --> 16:43.600
That's...

16:43.634 --> 16:46.370
Reverend Jim, yeah.
                          Right.

16:46.404 --> 16:49.373
Hey, uh, would you
       like to meet him?

16:50.241 --> 16:52.609
I don't know.

16:52.643 --> 16:55.912
Jim, why don't you get
  in the back seat with Craig

16:55.947 --> 16:58.382
and, uh, talk to him a minute,

16:58.416 --> 17:00.617
'cause it, it would be so nice

17:00.652 --> 17:02.753
if he'd come out
    for just a little while.

17:02.787 --> 17:04.655
Sure.

17:09.493 --> 17:10.761
Ahem!

17:11.896 --> 17:15.398
Uh, I think I'll
lock my door, too.

17:18.469 --> 17:21.704
Take me to Yankee Stadium.

17:21.739 --> 17:24.308
(laughing)

17:24.342 --> 17:25.810
Uh...

17:25.844 --> 17:27.877
(clearing throat)

17:27.912 --> 17:30.281
Now that we're close,

17:30.315 --> 17:33.184
why don't you join me
     in the great outdoors?

17:33.218 --> 17:36.120
I'd really like to very much,

17:36.154 --> 17:37.854
but I'm, I feel kind of numb.

17:37.888 --> 17:40.458
And I don't think I can
     move right now, okay?

17:40.492 --> 17:44.128
Listen, Craig...

17:44.162 --> 17:47.864
not only do I understand
         how you feel,

17:47.899 --> 17:51.902
but I used to pay
       hard-earned money

17:51.937 --> 17:55.238
to get to feel the way you feel.

17:57.709 --> 17:59.442
Excuse me.

18:06.918 --> 18:10.721
I couldn't do anything
for him, but I love him.

18:12.056 --> 18:14.057
Let me talk to him.

18:14.091 --> 18:15.158
(knocks on door)

18:19.864 --> 18:21.765
How you doing?

18:21.799 --> 18:22.933
(muttering)

18:22.967 --> 18:24.168
I'm Tony.

18:24.202 --> 18:25.969
You know what I do
       when I feel wired?

18:26.003 --> 18:27.837
I play handball.

18:27.872 --> 18:29.540
You hit the ball
    against the wall, right?

18:29.574 --> 18:31.375
(bangs door)
Bam! It comes back at you.

18:31.409 --> 18:32.676
You hit it against
        the wall again.

18:32.710 --> 18:34.912
(bangs door)
Bam! It comes back at you again!

18:34.946 --> 18:36.280
And you hit it against
        the wall again!
             Don't hit it again.

18:36.314 --> 18:38.582
Please!
Bam! It comes back
to you again.

18:38.616 --> 18:41.518
You do that until your hand
     is like a raw cutlet.

18:41.552 --> 18:43.353
You do that long enough,

18:43.388 --> 18:45.255
you're too exhausted
          to feel bad.

18:48.092 --> 18:51.961
Could I talk to the guy
     who's on drugs again?

18:54.198 --> 18:55.766
Hey, look,

18:55.800 --> 18:56.934
you know what I think?

18:56.968 --> 18:58.769
I say, you pull up your socks,

18:58.803 --> 19:00.336
and the two of us
      get out of this cab

19:00.371 --> 19:02.039
together right now.
        What do you say?

19:02.073 --> 19:04.174
I swear, I'd really like to,
      I would, I'd like to

19:04.208 --> 19:06.143
but that would mean I'd
  have to pry my fingers loose

19:06.177 --> 19:08.678
from this seat, and I don't
think that's possible right now.

19:10.448 --> 19:13.350
Ah, look, hang in there, baby.

19:13.384 --> 19:15.052
Hey, nobody thinks
       you're a bad guy.

19:15.086 --> 19:17.120
Thanks a lot.

19:17.155 --> 19:19.656
Next time I'll give jump rope.

19:30.334 --> 19:31.534
Hey, uh,

19:31.569 --> 19:34.104
we're just gonna
      sit here, you know?

19:34.106 --> 19:36.106
Hey, you want a cigar?

19:36.140 --> 19:38.475
No, no, thanks, no.

19:38.509 --> 19:42.346
You know, uh,
     I do some stage work.

19:42.380 --> 19:43.380
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.

19:43.414 --> 19:44.547
I didn't know that.

19:44.582 --> 19:45.782
I didn't know that,
         that's great.

19:45.816 --> 19:49.720
Yeah, I did eight things
        professionally.

19:49.754 --> 19:53.657
And I got scared every time
       I went out there.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.492
But...

19:55.526 --> 19:58.696
You got to go out there
 if you want to play that part.

19:58.730 --> 20:00.030
D-Do you know what I mean?

20:00.064 --> 20:01.865
Yeah.

20:01.899 --> 20:04.301
You're making a comparison
       between my problem

20:04.336 --> 20:06.303
and being an actor on the stage.

20:06.337 --> 20:08.271
Yeah, that's right, I mean,

20:08.306 --> 20:11.008
but I got scared;
    I mean, I used to shake.

20:11.042 --> 20:12.442
But something always
        used to happen.

20:12.477 --> 20:15.412
I'd remember Peter O'Toole,
            he said

20:15.446 --> 20:19.750
he said, "If they think they can
     do it better than me,

20:19.784 --> 20:22.619
then why aren't they up here
     doing it themselves?"

20:22.653 --> 20:23.520
Yeah.
And that always gave me

20:23.554 --> 20:25.389
the inspiration to go on.

20:25.423 --> 20:27.190
That's great. He said that?

20:27.224 --> 20:30.460
Yeah.

20:30.494 --> 20:32.161
But what if,

20:32.196 --> 20:34.731
what if Lawrence Olivier
       and Marlon Brando

20:34.766 --> 20:36.867
and Vanessa Redgrave
    were sitting out there?

20:36.901 --> 20:40.270
I never thought of that.

20:40.305 --> 20:41.772
And then, and then,

20:41.806 --> 20:43.206
and then what if
                Ralph Richardson

20:43.240 --> 20:45.475
and Paul Scofield
        and John Gielgud

20:45.509 --> 20:47.110
happened to be sitting
      right next to them?

20:47.144 --> 20:49.412
All of them?

20:49.447 --> 20:51.448
As a matter of fact,
                what if, what if

20:51.482 --> 20:53.217
it was an actors benefit
     and every great actor

20:53.251 --> 20:56.053
in the whole world was sitting
out there, then what do you do?

20:56.087 --> 20:58.155
I don't deserve
     to be in the theater.

21:00.157 --> 21:00.824
Bob...

21:00.859 --> 21:02.892
Alex, I stink.
                  Yeah.

21:02.927 --> 21:04.594
Yeah, I know, we'll talk
       about that later.

21:04.628 --> 21:05.895
Come on.

21:09.300 --> 21:10.701
Yeah, all right.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.237
Uh, just, uh, let me
talk to him, all right?

21:13.271 --> 21:14.738
It's about time, Alex.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.606
Now we'll finally
    get him out of the cab.

21:21.278 --> 21:23.480
Listen, Craig...

21:26.584 --> 21:28.452
I think we'd better
         take you home.

21:28.486 --> 21:29.953
All right?

21:32.022 --> 21:33.990
Elaine, I think you'd
better drive him home.

21:34.024 --> 21:36.260
Yeah, I think that's
               a very good idea.
Okay, look, Craig

21:36.294 --> 21:37.594
don't feel bad about it.
        I don't, I don't.

21:37.628 --> 21:39.296
It's only your first day.
          You were so wonderful.

21:39.330 --> 21:40.697
Okay, Elaine why don't
       you take him home.

21:40.732 --> 21:42.933
It's really no
                 problem at all.

21:42.967 --> 21:44.468
Whoa!

21:51.609 --> 21:53.710
Craig, are you okay?

21:53.745 --> 21:55.078
I don't know.

21:55.112 --> 21:57.213
Can you take a step?

22:02.453 --> 22:04.321
How's that?

22:04.355 --> 22:05.622
Another one.

22:07.992 --> 22:09.192
Okay.

22:09.227 --> 22:11.561
Come to me.

22:11.595 --> 22:13.963
I feel kind of stupid.

22:13.998 --> 22:16.566
(gently):
               Come on, come on.

22:19.504 --> 22:21.738
Very good.

22:23.040 --> 22:24.173
(sighs)

22:26.677 --> 22:28.011
Oh, it's okay,
               it's okay.

22:28.046 --> 22:29.580
It's okay,
             it's okay.

22:29.614 --> 22:32.349
Really,
              just relax.

22:35.586 --> 22:38.521

       "Stormy Weather")
