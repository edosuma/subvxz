00:00.801 --> 00:02.335
We're gonna be late
for the parade!

00:02.469 --> 00:03.669
- Okay. Relax, Andy.

00:03.671 --> 00:04.937
The parade
is not going anywhere.

00:05.072 --> 00:06.271
- I don't want
to miss the floats.

00:06.407 --> 00:07.540
- Nah, we're okay, buddy.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.342
- Andy, why are you
so pumped up?

00:09.476 --> 00:10.876
- Cause I love
the Thanksgiving parade.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.611
When I was a kid,
I loved seeing

00:12.613 --> 00:14.213
the engine go down the street.

00:14.349 --> 00:15.548
- You still sound
like a little kid.

00:15.683 --> 00:17.082
- I don't know about all that,

00:17.084 --> 00:18.817
but you could call me
a card-carrying

00:18.819 --> 00:20.152
Parade-ophile!

00:20.287 --> 00:21.620
[cackles]

00:21.622 --> 00:23.155
- I'd be careful
how you enunciate that.

00:23.290 --> 00:24.823
- Ike, come on.
Let's get moving, hurry!

00:24.825 --> 00:26.359
- Okay, little buddy.
We got lots of time.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.960
You know the parade route's
just two blocks

00:28.095 --> 00:29.428
from here, right?
- Are we there yet?

00:29.564 --> 00:31.296
- [laughs]
- Are we there yet?

00:31.298 --> 00:32.431
- All right,
we'll be there in a sec.

00:32.567 --> 00:34.433
- Just kidding.
Are we there yet?

00:34.435 --> 00:37.302
[engine rumbles and sputters]

00:37.304 --> 00:40.673
[clanking and rattling]
- Oh!

00:43.978 --> 00:45.778
[hissing]

00:47.782 --> 00:50.649
- No, sir.
This engine's going nowhere.

00:50.651 --> 00:53.518
- No, no, not today.
- Aw, I'm sorry, Andy.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.120
- Well, why can't we
throw the truck in neutral?

00:55.256 --> 00:56.922
I could ride on top,
and then the rest of you guys

00:57.058 --> 00:58.591
could just push it down
the parade route.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.792
- We need to get
the engine fixed

00:59.927 --> 01:01.326
in case we get a call.
Hey, Ike,

01:01.462 --> 01:02.928
call the superintendent
of apparatus.

01:03.064 --> 01:04.529
- Spatchcock? No!

01:04.665 --> 01:06.531
Chief, please.
- We need to get it fixed.

01:06.667 --> 01:07.733
- Chief, not Spatchcock.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.534
Not today!
- Ike, call him.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.737
- Okay.
- [huffs]

01:11.739 --> 01:14.673
- Andy, don't act like a baby.
- Okay. Go easy on him, Chief.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.742
He had his heart set on it.
- That's no reason to pout.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.543
- Well, leave me alone!
- Hey!

01:18.679 --> 01:21.013
You go cool off
in the bunk room, pal.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.348
- Fine!
Stupid engine...

01:23.350 --> 01:24.549
- He'll be all right,
poor fella.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.018
He just needs his nap.
- Hey, Andy,

01:26.153 --> 01:28.487
just remember everything
you should be thankful for.

01:28.623 --> 01:30.423
- Fuck you!
- Oh!

01:30.557 --> 01:31.757
You watch that mouth,
young man!

01:31.892 --> 01:33.492
- See what happens
when you give him juice?

01:33.494 --> 01:36.429
- Happy Thanksgiving,
everybody.

you guys have on Thanksgiving.

02:02.657 --> 02:04.123

- Don't jinx us.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.858
I predict three deep-fried

02:11.666 --> 02:12.998
want to hang out with us
this year?

02:13.134 --> 02:14.199

02:14.335 --> 02:15.468
so I'm gonna join
Lucy's sisters

02:15.602 --> 02:16.669
over at their granddad's house.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.403
- Thanksgiving
with the Commish.

02:18.405 --> 02:21.006
I've spent a lifetime trying
to avoid my dad on this day.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.476
I'm glad I'm on duty.
- And I'm glad I'm not.

02:23.610 --> 02:24.810
I'm gonna go change
into my civvies

02:24.812 --> 02:26.211
and get outta here
before Spatchcock

02:26.213 --> 02:28.013
shows up to fix that engine.
[all groan]

02:28.015 --> 02:30.149
- Ugh, Spatchcock
is disgusting.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.017
He's always covered
in grease and muck

02:32.019 --> 02:33.752
and he's always bleeding
from somewhere.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.620
- Spatchcock is always
going on and on

02:35.622 --> 02:37.690
about some useless drivel. Ugh!

02:37.825 --> 02:40.025
- Spatchcock.
He always makes me feel like

02:40.027 --> 02:41.494
it's my fault
when anything breaks down.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.496
- All right.
Well, have fun everyone.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.698
- We'll miss you deeply,
Chiefy!

02:45.833 --> 02:47.366
- [quietly]
Nice acting job.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.302
Even I believed you wanted
Chief to stick around.

02:49.436 --> 02:52.037
- Thank you. It really
was a masterclass, wasn't it?

02:52.039 --> 02:54.307
I love him, but the best part
about working on Thanksgiving

02:54.441 --> 02:57.576
is we get to do it our way,
not the Terry McConky way.

02:57.712 --> 02:59.578
- He can be a bit overbearing.

02:59.714 --> 03:01.580
At home, he makes us
wear Pilgrim hats,

03:01.582 --> 03:04.317
play touch football,
eat all his lame dishes.

03:04.451 --> 03:05.851
This is gonna be
my first Thanksgiving

03:05.987 --> 03:07.720
without all his rules,
and I am very excited.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.855
- Station Thanksgiving
has no rules.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.990
- Now you're talking!

03:11.125 --> 03:11.991
- For dinner, we can make

03:12.126 --> 03:12.992
whatever we want.

03:13.127 --> 03:14.660
I'm making spaghetti pie.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.395
- I'm making turkey
and stuffing, but this year,

03:16.531 --> 03:18.531
it's a free-range
Narraganset turkey,

03:18.666 --> 03:20.799
and I'm stuffing it
with crab meat

03:20.801 --> 03:22.868
stuffed inside a salmon.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.738
- Ooh, you're talking
about turcrabmon?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.806
I just read about that
in this November's issue

03:27.942 --> 03:30.275
of "Delicious AF."
- Yeah!

03:30.411 --> 03:33.078
- See, this is the Thanksgiving
I've always dreamed of.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.348
- Let's get it started
with a homemade onion dip.

03:35.482 --> 03:37.883
Lucy, do me a favor
and chop some onions, please.

03:38.019 --> 03:39.618
- How am I already
the onion bitch?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.086
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm just glad that

03:41.088 --> 03:43.022
I don't have to eat
my dad's yams this year.

03:43.024 --> 03:44.557
I've been hiding them
in my napkin

03:44.692 --> 03:46.491
and flushing them
down the toilet for ten years.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.361
- But I love
a good sweet potato pie.

03:48.495 --> 03:49.828
- Pretty sure
they're different.

03:49.964 --> 03:51.697
- Sweet potatoes and yams
are the same thing.

03:51.699 --> 03:52.631
- No, actually guys, I think

03:52.767 --> 03:54.900
all sweet potatoes are yams,

03:54.902 --> 03:58.103
but not all yams
are sweet potatoes.

03:58.105 --> 03:59.638
- Wrong!

03:59.774 --> 04:02.775
A yam is not a yam at all.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.644
They're all sweet potatoes.
Ugh!

04:05.780 --> 04:07.913
- Spatchcock.
- [through teeth] Spatchcock.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.915
- In the 1930s, a farmer called

04:10.051 --> 04:12.918
a soft, orange sweet potato
a yam

04:13.054 --> 04:15.588
to distinguish it
from other sweet potatoes.

04:15.723 --> 04:18.191
But a real yam
is a root vegetable

04:18.325 --> 04:19.858
found in tropical climates.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.862
So your yam
is not a yam at all!

04:23.864 --> 04:25.130
You got any duct tape?

04:25.132 --> 04:27.400
I sliced my thumb
on a fan blade.

04:27.534 --> 04:28.734
- Come on, Spatchcock.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.269
Why don't you go
wash that off, man?

04:30.405 --> 04:32.204
We can put a bandage on it.
- The tape's adhesive

04:32.339 --> 04:34.473
binds with the motor oil,
creates a salve.

04:34.475 --> 04:36.475
Most people don't know that.

04:36.611 --> 04:39.078
Oh, thank you there, Crysie.

04:39.080 --> 04:41.947
If only you could treat
the engine with as much care.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.416
- I didn't do anything to it,
Spatchcock.

04:43.550 --> 04:47.420
- That's funny. Always seems
to happen on your watch.

04:47.554 --> 04:48.888
Oh, dear Lord!

04:49.023 --> 04:51.556
Young lady, you're
throwing away the best part.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.759
- [groans]

04:53.894 --> 04:56.361
Up to 35%
of the onion's vitamin C

04:56.363 --> 04:57.830
accumulates on the ends.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.299
Huh, no?
Okay, suit yourself.

05:00.301 --> 05:01.834
- All right. Enjoy.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.969
- She's an odd one, huh?
- Okay, Spatchcock.

05:04.105 --> 05:05.638
The engine's outside.
Get to work.

05:05.773 --> 05:08.307
- What, do you got yourself
a free-range bird there?

05:08.443 --> 05:09.708
- Uh-huh.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.843
- Definitely
the worst type to buy.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.645
Eventually, see,
when they do face death,

05:12.780 --> 05:15.380
they release
an adrenal fear hormone.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.516
Makes the meat taste bitter.

05:17.652 --> 05:19.719
Yeah.
[squelch]

05:21.789 --> 05:23.256
[gags]
Bitter.

05:23.390 --> 05:26.058
- Shut up, Spatchcock.
The meat is great.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.127
And don't you ever
touch my turkey again.

05:28.263 --> 05:30.463
- [gobbles]

05:30.598 --> 05:32.598
Oh, the big mon!

05:32.733 --> 05:33.932
How do you do?

05:33.934 --> 05:35.801
Salutations, Chief.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.670
- Spatchcock, how's the engine?

05:37.805 --> 05:39.805
- Crystal did a number on it,
but I can fix it.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.674
In the meantime,
I brought you a spare engine.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.008
- Fantastic.
I gotta get going, sorry.

05:43.144 --> 05:45.811
- Hey, I like the ensemble.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.480
You look like
you stepped right out

05:47.615 --> 05:49.348
of a Norman Rockwell painting.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.016
- Thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.551
- Yeah, interesting story.

05:52.687 --> 05:54.086
At the beginning
of World War I,

05:54.221 --> 05:56.755
Norman Rockwell tries
to enlist in the Navy.

05:56.757 --> 05:58.157
He gets rejected. Why?

05:58.293 --> 06:01.894
He's 17 pounds underweight.
- Fascinating--

06:02.029 --> 06:03.896
- Now check this out.
What's he do?

06:04.031 --> 06:05.764
He bulks up
for the next couple weeks

06:05.766 --> 06:08.901
on a diet
of donuts and bananas.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.769
Now I don't think
there was anything sexual,

06:10.771 --> 06:14.106
but we all have a dark side.

06:14.241 --> 06:16.041
Pretty sure
I know yours, Chief.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.810
Okay, pal.
- Great.

06:19.847 --> 06:22.982
- [quietly] I'll show you
a masterclass in acting.

06:23.117 --> 06:24.116
- Enjoy!

06:24.251 --> 06:25.985
- Chief, are you sure
you can't stay?

06:25.987 --> 06:27.520
- Oh, yeah, I gotta
get to the Commish's

06:27.654 --> 06:28.854
before they carve the bird.

06:28.990 --> 06:30.856
- Well, just know
that Thanksgiving's

06:30.992 --> 06:33.258
not gonna be the same
without you.

06:33.394 --> 06:36.061
- Aw, don't cry.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.596
My little girl doesn't
want to be away

06:37.732 --> 06:39.131
from her daddy on Thanksgiving.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.133
What was I thinking?
Of course I'll stay.

06:41.268 --> 06:43.468
I'm gonna spend the day
with my number-one girl.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.870
- Oh, whoa, whoa!
Chief, Chief.

06:45.006 --> 06:46.539
What about
your other two daughters?

06:46.674 --> 06:48.941
- Eh, I'll just call 'em and
tell 'em I'm not gonna make it.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.343
- No, no, no.
You don't wanna do that.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.011
'Cause then they'll be upset--
[stammers]

06:52.146 --> 06:54.547
- Yeah, Lucy will be fine.
- I'm fine. I'm just--

06:54.682 --> 06:57.482
You know, I'm chopping onions.
- I know you're fine.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.817
'Cause I'm staying.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.219
I wonder if I have
those Pilgrim hats

07:00.355 --> 07:01.287
still in my office.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.623
- Poorly played, Lucy.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.025
You go get rid of him
right now.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.760
- Okay, all right. I'm sorry.
[alarm blaring]

07:09.496 --> 07:11.163

<i> from a deep-fried turkey.</i>

07:11.298 --> 07:13.099

you're getting rid of him.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.740
[hammering]

07:21.876 --> 07:24.410
- That turkey exploded like
it was stuffed with fireworks.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.945
- No salmonella there.
That bird was overcooked.

07:26.947 --> 07:29.815
- Spatchcock,
how's it going down there?

07:29.950 --> 07:31.684
Hope you're done soon
'cause that loaner sucks

you hear me?

[cranking continues]

07:45.566 --> 07:46.899
- Uh-huh.
Thought so.

07:47.035 --> 07:49.167

07:49.169 --> 07:52.104
Just helping myself
to some of your delicacies.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.839

07:53.974 --> 07:56.242
<i> - Oui, oui.</i>
Could use a bit more onion.

07:56.377 --> 07:58.044
- That's a double dip?
- Yeah.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.445
- Plenty for everybody.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.980
- Spatchcock, your blood
is in the bowl, man!

08:01.982 --> 08:04.383
- Is it blood,
or food coloring?

08:04.518 --> 08:05.718
It's blood.

08:05.853 --> 08:07.053
- Let's go watch some football.
- Ugh!

08:07.187 --> 08:09.588
- Yeah.
- Yeah, get out of here.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.390
Busy, busy.

08:11.392 --> 08:13.726
- [sighs]

08:13.728 --> 08:15.261
[TV chatter]

08:15.396 --> 08:17.329
- Hey, Chief, we were
gonna watch some football.

08:17.465 --> 08:18.597
- Lucy knows the routine.

08:18.733 --> 08:20.733
Parade first, then football.

08:20.868 --> 08:22.068
Don't worry.
I taped the game.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.335
- Why didn't you
tape the parade

08:23.471 --> 08:24.536
and watch the game live?

08:24.538 --> 08:25.738
- Parades are way better live!

08:25.740 --> 08:26.939
Andy, you love parades!

08:27.075 --> 08:28.807
- I love<i> riding</i> in parades.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.076
Watching a parade on TV

08:30.210 --> 08:31.810
is for little kids
and psychopaths.

08:31.946 --> 08:33.345
- Hey, simmer down, pal.
- What?

08:33.347 --> 08:35.614
- Here's Buzz Lightyear.
He's in that toy movie.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.815
About the story about the toys.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.350
I can't remember
the name of it.

08:38.486 --> 08:41.887
Be careful with those ropes!
He might really fly away.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.622
- Man, I bet my little sisters
are so bummed

08:43.758 --> 08:45.624
they don't get to watch
the parade with you this year.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.893
- No, I talked to them; they're
fine with me being here.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.095
- You guys,
let's get cleaned up

08:49.229 --> 08:50.829
and get ready
for the Turkey giveaway.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.164
- Hey, the cast of
"King Kong: The Musical"

08:52.300 --> 08:54.567
is on after the commercial.
- Uh-huh.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.635
- Okay.
- What's that?

08:56.637 --> 08:57.970
- It's my carving set.

08:57.972 --> 08:59.438
I brought it for dinner
at the Commish's,

08:59.440 --> 09:00.839
but now I'm just
gonna use it here.

09:00.841 --> 09:02.374
[blade scraping]

09:02.376 --> 09:04.510
- I carve the turkey here.
- Not when I'm around.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.244
I carve the turkey.
It's tradition.

09:06.246 --> 09:07.513
- Terry, this isn't your house.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.047
I'm carving the turkey here.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.717
- I'm the Chief.
I carve the turkey,<i> Captain.</i>

09:11.852 --> 09:13.786
[chuckles]

09:15.389 --> 09:16.455
Super sharp.

09:18.793 --> 09:20.459
- Uncle Eddie, I tried.

09:20.594 --> 09:22.795
- Well, try harder.
Because there's no way

09:22.930 --> 09:25.731
he's gonna stab
my turcrabmon!

09:33.541 --> 09:34.941
- You guys, man.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.344
He's making engine pizza
out of our scraps.

09:38.479 --> 09:40.146
Hey, Spatchcock,
you know you can use

09:40.281 --> 09:41.948
the stove inside,
if you want.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.882
- Thanks, Granny,
but actually I prefer this.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.283
It's a technique
my wife taught me.

09:45.285 --> 09:46.618
She was a long-haul trucker.

09:46.620 --> 09:49.355
Cooked many a-engine pizza
in her days.

09:49.490 --> 09:50.957
- Okay...

09:51.091 --> 09:52.224
- You guys,
we should invite him

09:52.360 --> 09:53.826
to stay with us for dinner.

09:53.962 --> 09:55.227
- No way!
Are you kidding me? No.

09:55.363 --> 09:57.095
- Yeah, he can have dinner
with his wife.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.965
- Haven't you seen "Planes,
Trains and Automobiles"?

09:59.099 --> 10:00.899
His wife's probably dead!
- I haven't seen it.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.168
And you just ruined it.
- I'm serious.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.636
His wife's probably dead.

10:03.771 --> 10:05.504
He's probably very alone
right now.

10:05.506 --> 10:07.039
- You're right.
My wife is dead.

10:07.175 --> 10:08.975
- Oh, you--I'm sorry, man.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.977
You could hear us?
- Yeah, I hear everything.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.645
She died a couple years back.

10:12.647 --> 10:14.780
Logging accident.

10:14.915 --> 10:16.248
Yes, it was her fault.
- Hey, man.

10:16.384 --> 10:19.185
Look, we're really sorry
to hear about that.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.587
And with that being said,
we'd like to invite you

10:21.722 --> 10:23.121
to join us for dinner.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.191
- You're sweeter
than a honeycrisp, Granny,

10:25.326 --> 10:27.393
but, uh, actually
already have plans

10:27.528 --> 10:29.127
with my girlfriend.

10:29.129 --> 10:29.996
Who's a model.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.130
Yeah, and her twin sister,

10:32.132 --> 10:34.667
and we're gonna
probably hot tub

10:34.669 --> 10:36.869
and, uh, shave each other.

10:36.871 --> 10:38.470
- Okay, cool.
See? He's not available.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.138
He's gonna be in a hot tub
with two twins

10:40.274 --> 10:41.740
and they're gonna
shave each other.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.410
- Keep an eye on the pizza.

10:44.545 --> 10:47.079
I'm gonna go steal some cheese
from that spa-gah-ti pie.

10:47.215 --> 10:49.415
Spa-gah-ti!
That's how you say it.

10:49.550 --> 10:51.017
- It's obvious that
he has too much pride

10:51.151 --> 10:53.819
to admit that
he has nowhere to go.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.354
I say,
over the course of the day,

10:55.356 --> 10:57.356
we secretly break equipment
for him to fix,

10:57.491 --> 10:58.891
and then,
by the time he's done,

10:59.027 --> 11:00.626
it'll be easy for him to stay.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.428
- Pfft, lame!
- Hey.

11:02.563 --> 11:04.430
- Why don't you grow up
and start thinking

11:04.565 --> 11:06.965
about other people
instead of yourself, mister?

11:07.101 --> 11:09.035
- Okay, listen.
I'll do it.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.037
But only because
I like breaking stuff.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.838
- Scatter! Hurry, scatter!
- What?

11:12.973 --> 11:15.107
- Hurry! Come on! Go, go, go!
He's coming. He's coming.

11:15.109 --> 11:17.576
- Hey, who's ready
for some football?

11:17.578 --> 11:20.312
- Chief, right now
isn't a good time.

11:20.314 --> 11:22.381
- Hey, Captain, button hook.
- Come on, Terry.

11:22.383 --> 11:23.716
My hands are covered
with Crisco.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.584
- I'm going long.

11:25.720 --> 11:26.985
Come on.
Whip it.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.654
- Dad! Dad!
- What are you doing?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.389
all: Oh!
- Dad, are you okay?

11:30.524 --> 11:33.191
- Hey. Hey, man.
- I'm okay.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.662
Hey, touchdown!
[sighs]

11:36.797 --> 11:39.065
Okay. I didn't hurt my back,
so I consider that a victory.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.999
- How about that
flattened turkey down there?

11:41.001 --> 11:42.935
- This one?
Oh, boy.

11:43.071 --> 11:45.404
Oh, yeah.
It's a little squished, huh?

11:45.406 --> 11:47.139
It'll be okay.
Just rub some dirt in it.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.741
Right, guys? Hey!

11:48.876 --> 11:51.209
All right, who's up?
Somebody go for a pass.

11:51.345 --> 11:52.745
Oh, shit. My back.
- All right, I'll go.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.448
- Here you go--
oh, fuck.

12:01.489 --> 12:04.222
You making mashed potatoes?
- Mm-hmm.

12:04.358 --> 12:06.358
- You know the key
to good mashed potatoes?

12:06.360 --> 12:08.094
Butter.
The more butter, the better.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.495
That's what I always say.

12:09.630 --> 12:11.430
- I'm not making
traditional mashed potatoes.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.032
This recipe calls for soy milk
and parmesan cheese.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.834
- Ah, gross.

12:15.970 --> 12:18.504
You stir like a caveman.

12:18.639 --> 12:21.507
Is that crab meat?
- Yes.

12:21.642 --> 12:23.375
- In your stuffing?
- Yes.

12:23.377 --> 12:25.043
- Crab meat stuffing?
- You know,

12:25.179 --> 12:26.712
if you don't like it,
you don't have to eat it.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.246
- We should try Stove Top.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.582
- Oh, God.
What are you, six years old?

12:29.717 --> 12:31.183
- You've never let us
have it before,

12:31.185 --> 12:32.318
and I've always wanted
to try it.

12:32.453 --> 12:33.385
- Let me tell you something:

12:33.387 --> 12:34.920
stuffing is a delicacy,

12:35.055 --> 12:36.522
and it deserves
delicious accents

12:36.657 --> 12:38.791
like pecans or figs.

12:38.793 --> 12:39.926
Ooh, or apples!

12:40.060 --> 12:42.128
I'm gonna get you apples.

12:42.263 --> 12:43.929
- I would hide that turkey
right now.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.132
He's gonna give you ten
suggestions on how to cook it.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.666
And that's before he sees

12:47.668 --> 12:49.802
that you've stuffed it
with salmon and crab.

12:49.938 --> 12:51.304
- Get rid of him!

12:54.008 --> 12:55.407
- Well, I couldn't
find any apples,

12:55.543 --> 12:57.209
but I got raisins.
Next best thing, right?

12:57.345 --> 12:59.011
- Dad, maybe you should
let him make what he wants.

12:59.013 --> 13:01.347
- This looks like leftover
night at the United Nations.

13:01.482 --> 13:03.215
- Dad, if you want
a traditional Thanksgiving,

13:03.351 --> 13:04.616
then go over
to Grandpa's house.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.152
We don't have any
of that stuff here.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.753
- Oh, I do.
It's in my truck.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.688
I was gonna bring it
to your granddad's house.

13:09.690 --> 13:11.423
Go out to my truck.
I got canned corn,

13:11.425 --> 13:13.492
canned cranberries,
canned gravy.

13:13.494 --> 13:15.894
Oh, and your favorite,
canned yams, huh?

13:16.030 --> 13:19.097
Go ahead.
Quick like a bunny.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.500
Meanwhile,
I'm gonna raisin this up.

13:21.636 --> 13:23.369
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm adding raisins.

13:23.504 --> 13:25.371
The more wrinkled the raisin,
the sweeter the fruit.

13:25.506 --> 13:29.041
- You pick those
out of there right now.

13:29.177 --> 13:30.643
[clattering]

13:30.778 --> 13:32.578
- Why am I the one that needs
to squeeze back here?

13:32.713 --> 13:34.580
- 'Cause you're smaller
than we are.

13:34.715 --> 13:37.650
If we sabotage the air ducts,
then maybe I'll do it, okay?

13:37.652 --> 13:39.385
Just don't be a baby
about it, Andy.

13:39.520 --> 13:41.119
[explosion]
- [yelps]

13:41.121 --> 13:42.488
- Ooh, busted.

13:43.992 --> 13:45.858
- Washing machine down.

13:45.994 --> 13:47.059
- Good job, little buddy.

13:47.195 --> 13:48.995
- You made that washer
unusable.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.196
I'm gonna go tell Spatchcock.

13:50.331 --> 13:51.998
- Chief.
Hey, Chief, Chief.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.066
Chief, Chief, Chief, Chief.

13:54.202 --> 13:56.202
You know, if they really
wanna fix football,

13:56.337 --> 13:58.204
they ought to hang a tire
from the goal post.

13:58.339 --> 14:00.006
If you kick the ball
through it, 75 points.

14:00.140 --> 14:01.273
That'd be a game.

14:01.409 --> 14:02.875
- Don't you have something
to go fix?

14:02.877 --> 14:04.610
- Trying to fix football.

14:04.745 --> 14:06.144
- Hey, Spatchcock.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.479
Our washing machine
is acting up.

14:07.615 --> 14:09.081
You think you could
take a look at it?

14:09.083 --> 14:10.416
- You guys are
a bunch of clowns.

14:10.551 --> 14:11.750
- Right on.

14:11.752 --> 14:12.885
Okay, all right.

14:13.021 --> 14:14.753
Okay, Jesus.

14:14.889 --> 14:16.889
- You should trim the ends
of those beans.

14:17.025 --> 14:18.957
Adds more flavor.

14:18.959 --> 14:21.293
- We need this guy outta here.
He's gonna ruin our whole day.

14:21.295 --> 14:22.895
[alarm blaring]
<i> - Station 24.</i>

14:23.031 --> 14:25.364
<i> Fire at 3002 Pembroke Avenue.</i>

14:25.366 --> 14:28.567
<i> Deep-fried turkey accident.</i>

14:28.703 --> 14:31.169
- Hey, sorry. I'd join you,
but I'm off-duty.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.771
And I just cracked number two.

14:32.773 --> 14:34.506
- Yeah, I can tell
by your bar tan.

14:34.508 --> 14:36.174
Don't worry.
You just relax.

14:36.310 --> 14:38.176
And do me a favor and man
the turkey giveaway table

14:38.178 --> 14:40.512
while we're gone.
- Will do.

14:40.648 --> 14:42.180
Oh, come on.
He jumped.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.482
He jumped!

14:45.386 --> 14:46.853
There you go.
That's a heavy one.

14:46.987 --> 14:49.788
15-pounder. Happy holiday, sir.
Thank you.

14:49.924 --> 14:52.458
Hi, how are ya?

14:52.593 --> 14:54.192
Hmm.

14:54.194 --> 14:56.128
Looks a little banged up, huh?

14:56.264 --> 14:58.997
Maybe we could find you
another one.

14:59.133 --> 15:02.735
I'm not sure if maybe--

15:02.737 --> 15:05.203
oh, I got one over here.

15:05.339 --> 15:07.806
Ah, look at this.

15:07.808 --> 15:09.675
Oh, it's heavy.

15:09.810 --> 15:11.811
Hey, keep the pan.
- Thank you.

15:15.215 --> 15:17.215
Oh, yeah.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.484
Don't you worry,
my flat friend.

15:18.619 --> 15:21.019
We will find a home for you.

15:21.155 --> 15:22.288
Okay.

15:24.625 --> 15:28.026
[brakes squealing]
Gonna watch some football!

15:28.162 --> 15:29.895
- Ooh, baby!
Gotta tell you.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.098
That repaired engine
was purring like a kitten.

15:32.233 --> 15:33.566
It felt great.

15:33.701 --> 15:36.168
- Thanks, Crystal.
Let's keep it that way.

15:36.304 --> 15:37.303
- Yeah, you bet.

15:37.438 --> 15:38.504
- Hoo-hoo!

15:38.639 --> 15:40.773
Can't wait to get my bird
in the oven.

15:40.775 --> 15:42.308
Where's my turkey?

15:42.443 --> 15:44.242
- Might wanna ask the Chief.

15:44.244 --> 15:47.045
- Nobody cooks my turkey
but me.

15:47.181 --> 15:48.647
- Oh, brother.

15:48.649 --> 15:51.183
- Time out, time out.
Call timeout! Come on.

15:51.319 --> 15:53.319
- Where's my turkey?
- What turkey?

15:53.454 --> 15:54.853
- Spatchcock says you took it.

15:54.989 --> 15:56.789
- Speaking of turkeys,
when's that guy gonna leave?

15:56.924 --> 15:59.458
- What's this?
- Oh, that's a smushed one.

15:59.460 --> 16:00.793
I figured we could use it
to round out

16:00.795 --> 16:02.594
our traditional
Thanksgiving dinner.

16:02.596 --> 16:04.730
- I bought an expensive,
free-range, Narraganset turkey,

16:04.865 --> 16:06.398
and I had it out there
on the app floor.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.733
What happened to it?
- That's where we keep

16:07.868 --> 16:09.802
the giveaways.
Why would you put it there?

16:09.804 --> 16:12.070
- So you wouldn't mess with it.
- Well, you should've put it

16:12.206 --> 16:13.472
somewhere else.
It's gone.

16:13.607 --> 16:15.073
- But I stuffed it
with crab and salmon.

16:15.075 --> 16:17.243
- Sounds gross.
That woman's gonna be bummed.

16:18.746 --> 16:20.879
- [chuckles]
Tape ain't gonna cut it

16:20.881 --> 16:23.081
for a big head like me.
I need my stapler.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.617
- Enough is enough. It's time
to just come out and tell him.

16:25.619 --> 16:27.153
- What am I supposed to say?

16:27.287 --> 16:28.887
- He is ruining
our Thanksgiving.

16:29.023 --> 16:30.823
- Pfft, Spatchcock.

16:30.959 --> 16:32.491
- But he's my dad.
I can't just tell him

16:32.626 --> 16:34.827
we don't want him around.

16:34.829 --> 16:36.362
Did you know that
the guys are actually

16:36.497 --> 16:38.096
trying to get Spatchcock
to stay?

16:38.098 --> 16:39.565
- Spatchcock? Why?

16:39.700 --> 16:41.233
- They think
it'd be a good gesture.

16:41.369 --> 16:43.636
- [chuckles]
Think of the irony of that.

16:43.771 --> 16:45.371
Trying to get the Chief
to leave

16:45.506 --> 16:47.373
and Spatchcock to stay.

16:47.508 --> 16:49.775
Who woulda thunk it?
[laughter]

16:49.910 --> 16:51.844
- All right.
I'll tell him.

16:51.846 --> 16:52.812
- Okay.

16:54.915 --> 16:56.182
- Dad.

16:56.317 --> 16:58.718
No, look.
Can I--can I explain?

17:00.188 --> 17:01.988
Dad, hold on.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.722
Dad, wait.
- Gotta go.

17:03.724 --> 17:06.124
Gonna be late for dinner
with your sisters.

17:06.260 --> 17:08.727
- Dad, come on.

17:08.729 --> 17:11.329
Dad.
[car sputtering]

17:11.331 --> 17:14.733
Hey, can we just talk?

17:14.869 --> 17:16.869
Dad?

17:16.871 --> 17:19.405
- I can't hear you.
- Okay, okay.

17:19.540 --> 17:22.074
Well, can you
roll the window down?

17:22.210 --> 17:23.609
- I can't roll the window down.

17:23.744 --> 17:25.744
- I thought
you couldn't hear me.

17:25.880 --> 17:26.979
- [grumbles]

17:29.884 --> 17:31.617
I just had this truck serviced.

17:31.752 --> 17:33.151
- Dad, please stay.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.820
- Shouldn't you be saying that
to Spatchcock?

17:34.955 --> 17:36.755
Sounds like he's the one
you want to stay.

17:36.757 --> 17:38.824
- I'm sorry. I should've
said something sooner.

17:38.959 --> 17:40.492
I love your traditions,
but this was

17:40.494 --> 17:41.627
my first Station Thanksgiving

17:41.762 --> 17:43.229
and I was excited about it.

17:43.364 --> 17:44.630
Because it was mine,
and, you know,

17:44.765 --> 17:46.498
I get to be one of the guys.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.900
- Well, why'd you cry
when I was leaving?

17:47.902 --> 17:49.501
- Because
I was chopping onions.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.503
- Let that be a lesson to you.

17:51.505 --> 17:53.039
Only use canned onions.
- Dad--

17:53.173 --> 17:54.306
- You know, I was excited

17:54.442 --> 17:55.908
for your first
Station Thanksgiving too.

17:55.910 --> 17:58.977
- Please stay.
- I know where I'm not welcome.

17:58.979 --> 17:59.912
- Dad!

18:01.115 --> 18:02.849
[car sputtering]
Dad.

18:02.983 --> 18:04.350
Seriously?

18:13.361 --> 18:15.093
- This turkey is bullshit.

18:15.229 --> 18:16.562
There's no cavity anymore.

18:16.697 --> 18:18.631
It could never have held
a crab-stuffed salmon.

18:18.766 --> 18:20.699
- I don't think it's bullshit.

18:20.701 --> 18:22.368
I think it's gonna be
a delicious turcrabmon,

18:22.503 --> 18:25.571
even if it's not stuffed with
salmon and crab or whatever.

18:25.706 --> 18:27.506
- It won't be turcrabmon
without it.

18:27.508 --> 18:28.774
That's what the "crab"
and the "mon"

18:28.909 --> 18:31.377
in the name means.
- Oh, right.

18:31.512 --> 18:33.179
Ah, man.
Yeah, we thought it was, like,

18:33.314 --> 18:34.647
named after the guy
who invented it,

18:34.649 --> 18:36.915
like Ignatius Turcrabmon,
or something.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.318
- Who's "we"?
- We all did.

18:39.453 --> 18:41.253
- How'd it go?
- Not great.

18:41.255 --> 18:42.521
- Yo, the washing machine
is fixed,

18:42.657 --> 18:44.790
but I don't see Spatchcock
anywhere.

18:44.925 --> 18:45.825
[door opens]

18:48.062 --> 18:49.728
- Room for one more?

18:49.730 --> 18:51.263
- Yes.
all: Hey!

18:51.399 --> 18:53.399
- Yeah, man.
Get in here!

18:53.534 --> 18:56.468
- Hey, how about another?

18:56.604 --> 18:58.537
- You know it!
all: Yeah.

18:58.673 --> 19:00.939
[all speaking at once]

19:00.941 --> 19:01.941
- The Cock!

19:03.811 --> 19:05.944
- Why does Spatchcock get
to sit at the big table

19:05.946 --> 19:07.413
and I have to sit here
all by myself?

19:07.548 --> 19:09.147
- Shh, stop.
Because he's our guest.

19:09.149 --> 19:11.483
Do you wanna have our guest
sit alone over here?

19:11.485 --> 19:12.885
- Yeah.
- Hey, cut it out.

19:12.887 --> 19:14.553
[glass clinking]

19:14.689 --> 19:15.954
- Excuse me.
Listen up, listen up.

19:16.090 --> 19:18.757
So I know I can be
a bit of a buttinsky--

19:18.759 --> 19:19.825
- Come on!
- No.

19:19.960 --> 19:22.028
- No.
- Yes, absolutely.

19:22.162 --> 19:25.297
- But I was hoping that
you guys could tolerate

19:25.433 --> 19:26.899
one more
Thanksgiving tradition.

19:26.901 --> 19:28.835
I would love to go
around the table

19:28.969 --> 19:31.503
and hear
what everyone's thankful for.

19:31.505 --> 19:34.373
Okay? I'll go first,
I'll go first.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.576
All right, I am grateful

19:37.712 --> 19:40.246
that you guys put up with me

19:40.381 --> 19:43.382
for being, um,

19:43.384 --> 19:45.918
a tiny bit micromanage-y.

19:46.054 --> 19:48.987
But just so you know,
it's for your own good, okay?

19:49.123 --> 19:50.322
And that's it.

19:50.324 --> 19:52.524
- I got one, guys.
- Oh, okay.

19:52.660 --> 19:54.526
- Things that
I am thankful for:

19:54.662 --> 19:56.729
good health, uh,

19:56.731 --> 19:59.798
learning from my mistakes,

19:59.934 --> 20:02.268
the kindness of strangers--

20:02.403 --> 20:03.802
- Ike, what--what's this?

20:03.804 --> 20:06.072
- I read an article about
things to be thankful for

20:06.206 --> 20:07.540
and wrote them down.

20:07.675 --> 20:08.807
- Do it from the heart.

20:08.809 --> 20:10.409
- Oh, yeah.
Yeah, sure.

20:10.411 --> 20:12.478
Um, of course.

20:12.613 --> 20:14.613
Uh, just off
the top of my head,

20:14.615 --> 20:18.484
uh, things that I am
personally thankful for:

20:18.619 --> 20:20.887
beautiful mountain streams,
the ocean,

20:21.021 --> 20:23.155
ladybugs, sisterhood--
- Okay. Let me...

20:23.291 --> 20:24.857
From the heart.

20:26.694 --> 20:28.627
- Uh...
[clears throat]

20:28.763 --> 20:30.763
Spoons.
Like, clean spoons.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.498
A lot of countries don't have--

20:32.633 --> 20:34.500
actually don't have
clean spoons.

20:34.635 --> 20:35.902
- Hey, Ike.
Hey, hey, hey, buddy.

20:36.036 --> 20:39.505
Guess what? I'm thankful
for Spatchcock joining us.

20:39.640 --> 20:40.639
- Joining us.
That's what--

20:40.641 --> 20:41.907
- Thank you, Granny.

20:42.042 --> 20:44.310
Wow, okay.

20:44.445 --> 20:46.912
I would say there are probably

20:47.047 --> 20:50.916
36 or 37 things
I'm grateful for this year.

20:51.051 --> 20:54.120
[laughter]

20:54.254 --> 20:55.587
Okay, number one:

20:55.589 --> 20:57.523
Hirschman Engineering
came out with a new line

20:57.658 --> 20:58.925
of ball bearings
this past summer.

20:59.059 --> 21:01.059
Now, as you know,
Hirschman's typically known

21:01.061 --> 21:03.529
for their rod ends
or their axial shafts.

21:03.664 --> 21:05.197
And so, when they came out
with ball bearings,

21:05.333 --> 21:07.333
there was a bunch of us online
just having a chitchat,

21:07.468 --> 21:09.735
going, "Can you believe
what they just dropped on us?"

21:09.870 --> 21:14.673
'Cause Hirschman owns
the patents on 45 truck parts.

21:14.675 --> 21:16.408
Of those 45 truck parts--
- Hi, Bernie.

21:16.544 --> 21:18.177
- We've been thinking about you
all day.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.681
- Sorry, gang. I know
you really had your heart set

21:22.817 --> 21:25.684
on me staying for dinner,
but these lovely ladies

21:25.686 --> 21:29.688
really, really wanna have me
for dinner.

21:29.690 --> 21:31.190
Little something to go.

21:33.561 --> 21:34.760
- Ugh!
- Thanks.

21:36.364 --> 21:37.896
Chief, one more thing.

21:38.032 --> 21:42.234
I took these out of your truck.

21:42.236 --> 21:43.769
- My spark plugs.

21:43.904 --> 21:45.171
- Yeah, I didn't want you
to get away

21:45.306 --> 21:47.974
without having a chance
to talk to your daughter.

21:48.108 --> 21:49.307
- How did you--

21:49.309 --> 21:51.577
- I hear everything.

21:51.712 --> 21:53.312
All right, ladies.

21:53.447 --> 21:55.181
Do your worst.
Uh-oh.

21:55.316 --> 21:57.716
[chuckles]
I'm about to get punished.

21:57.852 --> 21:59.185
- I did not see that coming.

21:59.319 --> 22:00.653
- Awoo!

22:00.655 --> 22:02.921
Lates!
[laughs]

22:03.057 --> 22:05.123
Whoo!

22:05.125 --> 22:07.726
- This is how "Planes,
Trains and Automobiles" ends?

22:07.862 --> 22:10.596
- Not exactly, but damn,
I thought he was lying.

22:10.731 --> 22:12.598
- All right, enough.
Let's eat.

22:12.733 --> 22:13.599
- Yes!
- Sounds great.

22:13.734 --> 22:14.733
I'm gonna let the Captain

22:14.869 --> 22:16.535
carve the flat turkey.

22:16.671 --> 22:18.070
- Oh, what an honor!
[alarm blaring]

22:18.206 --> 22:21.340
<i> - Station 24, a fire</i>
<i> at 707 Commerce Drive.</i>

22:21.475 --> 22:23.742
<i> It's a fried turkey fire,</i>
<i> again.</i>

22:23.744 --> 22:26.144
- Move out.

22:26.146 --> 22:28.881
- I'll hold down the fort,
keep the food warm.

22:31.552 --> 22:32.618
- Finally, dinner!

22:32.753 --> 22:35.621
- Whoo, baby!
- Ooh, yeah.

22:35.756 --> 22:37.423
- Whoa.
Where's all the food?

22:37.558 --> 22:40.626
It's all gone!

22:40.761 --> 22:42.228
- Who ate all this?

22:44.965 --> 22:47.033
- Terry McConky.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.967
- It actually
doesn't look half bad.

22:49.103 --> 22:51.169
- Yeah, I like
the outside-the-box thinking.

22:51.171 --> 22:52.971
Hey, Andy, why don't you
slide that pizza around?

22:53.107 --> 22:54.440
That part's not cooked
over there.

22:54.575 --> 22:55.641
- Why me?

22:55.776 --> 22:58.377
- 'Cause I bet
you'd be good at it.

22:58.512 --> 22:59.378
[sizzling]

22:59.513 --> 23:00.713
all: Aw!
- Andy.

23:00.848 --> 23:02.448
Come on.
Pay attention, pal!

23:02.583 --> 23:03.782
- Do it yourself next time!

23:03.918 --> 23:05.183
- Hey, buddy.
Come here.

23:05.185 --> 23:06.785
- Poor guy's
just having a rough day.

23:06.921 --> 23:08.987
[engine pops]
all: Whoa!

23:09.123 --> 23:11.457
- Ah, crap.
I hate to say it,

23:11.592 --> 23:13.926
but I think we're gonna have
to call Spatchcock.

23:13.928 --> 23:16.395
[both groan]

23:16.397 --> 23:19.331
- Did it stink?
You betcha!

23:19.333 --> 23:21.133
[laughter]

23:21.269 --> 23:23.201
- Spatchie, you're hysterical.

23:23.203 --> 23:26.072
[phone ringing]
- Oh!

23:26.206 --> 23:29.207
Hey, Granny.
How you doing?

23:29.209 --> 23:32.210
Okay, I'll be right there.

23:32.346 --> 23:33.946
Sorry, ladies.
Duty calls.

23:34.082 --> 23:35.948
- But Spatchles,
Pete Carroll's coming over,

23:36.084 --> 23:37.683
and we're supposed
to have a six-way.

23:37.818 --> 23:39.351
- It's not gonna take too long.

23:39.353 --> 23:42.288
Just keep the water hot
and the champagne cold.

23:42.423 --> 23:43.622
- Spatchie,
will you do the trick

23:43.758 --> 23:45.824
one more time before you leave?

23:45.826 --> 23:47.025
- I really gotta go.

23:47.027 --> 23:48.627
all: Please, please, please,

23:48.763 --> 23:50.028
please, please, please!

23:50.030 --> 23:52.498
- Okay.
all: Yay!

23:52.633 --> 23:54.366
- All right.

23:54.502 --> 23:55.701
[inhales deeply]

23:55.836 --> 23:59.005
[all cheering]
