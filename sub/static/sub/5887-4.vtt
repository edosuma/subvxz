<i>Previously on Mad Men...</i>

00:02.029 --> 00:04.360
- I have a two-year contract.
- Calm down.

00:04.567 --> 00:06.697
I'll find out what's going on
and I'll take care of it.

00:06.785 --> 00:08.007
I forgive you.

00:08.119 --> 00:09.409
And I forgive you.

00:09.622 --> 00:11.317
Well, we're not winning.
We don't have a computer.

00:11.423 --> 00:12.514
What?

00:12.613 --> 00:14.471
There are some stipulations.

00:14.626 --> 00:17.427
Outside of client hospitality,
there will be no drinking in the office.

00:17.557 --> 00:19.019
You'll be in Lane's old office.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.320
And you will report to Lou.

00:22.163 --> 00:25.448
Our fortunes are
in other people's hands...

00:26.151 --> 00:29.179
and we have to take them.

Catalina, which
includes a boat ride

01:12.091 --> 01:13.561
one of us will enjoy,

01:13.596 --> 01:15.937
<i>Yosemite, which is</i>
<i>a very long drive,</i>

01:15.971 --> 01:19.011
or Palm Springs, which--

01:19.045 --> 01:20.646
are you listening to me?

01:20.680 --> 01:24.119
Don't look.
Turn around.

01:24.154 --> 01:26.395
That man is staring at me.

01:26.429 --> 01:29.263
Well, I'm relieved that you weren't
looking for a better conversation.

01:29.296 --> 01:32.368
It's a little rude,
but I'm fine.

01:32.402 --> 01:35.742
- What were you saying?
- Very well.

01:36.744 --> 01:38.743
What are you doing?

01:38.778 --> 01:41.148
George?

01:42.688 --> 01:44.291
I didn't want to bother you.

01:44.328 --> 01:46.429
You're obviously
here on business.

01:46.464 --> 01:48.499
What?

01:48.534 --> 01:50.169
No.

01:50.204 --> 01:53.010
Trudy and I are divorced--
getting divorced.

01:53.045 --> 01:55.281
I've relocated to our
West Coast office.

01:55.318 --> 01:58.025
George Payton, this is Bonnie,
my real estate agent.

01:58.060 --> 02:00.563
I wish you would stop
introducing me that way.

02:00.597 --> 02:02.567
Why? It's good
for business.

02:02.602 --> 02:04.606
Okay, what if I say,

02:04.640 --> 02:07.850
"Bonnie, my girlfriend,
<i>your</i> real estate agent"?

02:07.884 --> 02:09.586
- Nice to meet you.
- Charmed.

02:09.621 --> 02:12.359
What brings you to LA?
There's no cough-and-cold season.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.760
- George works for Vicks.
- Oh.

02:14.794 --> 02:17.362
Actually, I left.
Please, sit.

02:19.265 --> 02:21.134
I'm working
for Burger Chef now.

02:21.169 --> 02:22.638
You can't be in
the hamburger business

02:22.672 --> 02:24.074
without taking a swing
at Disneyland.

02:24.108 --> 02:26.241
When did that happen?

02:26.275 --> 02:28.243
Right after Tom's heart attack.

02:28.277 --> 02:30.145
I thought of you.

02:30.179 --> 02:32.818
- Tom who?
- Tom Vogel.

02:32.853 --> 02:35.157
He had a heart attack?

02:35.192 --> 02:37.194
Who's that?

02:37.228 --> 02:39.564
My father-in-law.

02:39.599 --> 02:41.065
I hadn't heard about that.

02:41.099 --> 02:43.569
He's fine.

02:43.604 --> 02:45.205
Who knew he had a heart?

02:45.240 --> 02:47.310
Yes, right.

02:47.344 --> 02:49.845
You know we're putting
McCann in review.

02:49.879 --> 02:52.080
Be nice for us to work together
without old Tom in the way.

02:52.114 --> 02:54.551
Hm.

02:54.585 --> 02:55.954
It would kill him.

02:55.988 --> 02:57.888
( chuckles )

02:58.890 --> 03:00.258
Do you want to join us?

03:02.230 --> 03:03.831
How about I give you a call

03:03.865 --> 03:05.966
when I get back
to the home office?

03:06.001 --> 03:08.304
Of course.

03:08.339 --> 03:10.877
Have a wonderful evening.

03:15.084 --> 03:17.352
I love watching you work.

03:17.387 --> 03:19.256
That was skillful.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.160
Those conversations
happen all the time.

03:21.195 --> 03:23.763
Doesn't mean anything.

04:26.679 --> 04:29.913
Ahem--
any questions?

04:31.585 --> 04:33.152
Where are we supposed to work?

04:33.186 --> 04:36.089
You all have offices.

04:36.123 --> 04:38.159
Lloyd, from LeaseTech,
has informed us

04:38.194 --> 04:40.896
that the footprint of the
machine was prohibitive.

04:40.930 --> 04:43.133
<i>And then it occurred to us,</i>

04:43.167 --> 04:45.771
why not let every client
who sets foot in that door

04:45.805 --> 04:48.606
know that this agency
has entered the future?

04:48.640 --> 04:50.539
( applause )

04:55.513 --> 04:57.881
And please, we will try
and keep the construction

04:57.915 --> 05:00.317
and installation process
as brief as possible,

05:00.351 --> 05:03.024
but steer clear of the
area for your own safety.

05:03.058 --> 05:04.794
You might want to wear shoes.

05:04.828 --> 05:06.296
Thank you all.

05:09.533 --> 05:12.034
Dawn: If you have any personal
items in the creative lounge,

05:12.069 --> 05:13.937
please remove them immediately.

05:13.971 --> 05:17.108
Anything left behind at noon
today will be assumed garbage.

05:17.143 --> 05:18.812
They're driving us underground.

05:18.846 --> 05:21.147
You know Lou didn't
fight for our space.

05:21.181 --> 05:23.450
He doesn't believe in creative because
he doesn't know how to do it.

05:23.484 --> 05:25.419
Trust me, you're going
to use that computer

05:25.453 --> 05:27.755
more than you use that lounge.

05:29.426 --> 05:31.594
Did he hear me?

05:35.666 --> 05:38.403
Why were you late?
You know that's a no-no.

05:38.437 --> 05:40.003
I wasn't late.
I didn't get a memo.

05:40.037 --> 05:41.303
I don't even know
what's going on.

05:41.338 --> 05:43.137
Well, we're getting a computer.

05:43.171 --> 05:45.006
It's going to do
lots of magical things,

05:45.040 --> 05:46.742
like make Harry Crane
seem important.

05:46.777 --> 05:49.143
This decision must have been
made at the partners' level.

05:49.177 --> 05:52.378
It preceded you. You got a
problem, take it up with Cutler.

05:55.446 --> 05:57.278
Think it's too early

05:57.313 --> 05:59.512
to come in and celebrate our
technological advancement?

05:59.547 --> 06:01.480
I think that's worse than
being late, isn't it?

06:01.515 --> 06:03.682
You're right.
Good thinking.

06:03.717 --> 06:06.083
Maybe later, off campus.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.394
Harry Crane took a huge dump,

06:18.428 --> 06:20.095
and we got flushed
down the toilet.

06:20.129 --> 06:23.166
Ginsberg, don't you
believe in advertising?

06:23.200 --> 06:24.970
That computer
is the "Mona Lisa."

06:25.004 --> 06:26.938
People pay entry
to the whole Louvre

06:26.972 --> 06:28.607
just to walk by that thing.

06:29.942 --> 06:32.875
This is what was unique
about this place.

06:32.909 --> 06:35.578
I want the couch.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.647
That is not going to
fit in our office.

06:37.681 --> 06:39.249
Why don't we switch it with
the one in Lane's office?

06:39.283 --> 06:40.818
Because that one's really good.

06:40.852 --> 06:42.719
You mean Don's office?

06:42.753 --> 06:45.889
Don! Will you take
the other end of this?

06:47.158 --> 06:49.159
Okay.

06:55.535 --> 06:57.770
You gotta hold your
side a little lower.

06:57.804 --> 07:00.105
I'm on the heavy side of
the seesaw right now.

07:01.140 --> 07:03.178
A little to your right.

07:03.212 --> 07:05.112
My right.

07:05.147 --> 07:07.179
Damn it, Ginsberg.
Put it back.

07:07.213 --> 07:08.946
It's too big for our office.

07:08.981 --> 07:10.445
Come on, Stan.
I wanna try.

07:10.480 --> 07:11.912
The other one's full of farts.

07:13.916 --> 07:15.685
You're on your own.

07:18.089 --> 07:20.658
Ginsberg: <i> Let me put this in terms
the art department can understand--</i>

07:20.692 --> 07:23.695
they're trying to erase us!

07:23.729 --> 07:26.667
( yells ) But they can't
erase this couch!

07:58.198 --> 08:00.399
( sighs )

08:01.767 --> 08:03.467
So, in addition
to the fruitful nature

08:03.501 --> 08:05.102
of our previous
relationship at Vicks,

08:05.137 --> 08:08.475
George is very excited about
our bicoastal presence.

08:08.510 --> 08:12.548
Are we concerned about a conflict
with H Salt Fish & Chips?

08:12.582 --> 08:15.250
Pete: <i> - Ted?</i>
- H Salt views themselves

08:15.285 --> 08:17.520
as a specialty restaurant,
not fast food.

08:17.555 --> 08:19.724
( chuckles )
That's a joke, right?

08:19.758 --> 08:23.561
Pete, what did your friend
at Burger Chef say?

08:23.596 --> 08:25.834
They're going to open
their thousandth store

08:25.868 --> 08:27.769
and that's across 45 states.

08:27.803 --> 08:29.971
<i>George Payton knows</i>
<i>who his competition is</i>

08:30.005 --> 08:32.606
and he loves that we
understand the franchise game.

08:32.640 --> 08:35.038
Well, Ted, you're the
king of fish and chips,

08:35.073 --> 08:36.972
but I don't want you running
the team from out there.

08:37.006 --> 08:39.308
We're calling you home.

08:40.677 --> 08:42.775
Sorry, Jim,
I'm not going anywhere.

08:42.811 --> 08:44.713
I think we should
put Peggy on it.

08:44.747 --> 08:46.916
This is a national campaign.

08:46.950 --> 08:48.717
It's almost three million
in billings.

08:48.751 --> 08:50.483
The whole thing's
about the kitchen

08:50.517 --> 08:52.415
and the cleanliness and
getting to the homemakers.

08:52.450 --> 08:54.250
They'll want a woman.

08:55.854 --> 08:57.556
Lou?

08:57.590 --> 09:00.421
I think Peggy
is the right choice.

09:02.189 --> 09:04.188
Well, I'm glad all agree the
client is going to love

09:04.222 --> 09:05.622
having a woman's
point of view--

09:05.657 --> 09:07.558
or whatever
Peggy counts as--

09:07.592 --> 09:10.925
but is Don not even
on the list?

09:10.960 --> 09:12.759
I was thinking the same thing.

09:12.793 --> 09:14.994
He's spent three weeks
alone in that cave,

09:15.028 --> 09:16.493
and he hasn't clubbed
another ape yet.

09:16.527 --> 09:19.162
High praise indeed.
Lou?

09:20.532 --> 09:23.332
Don's a very valuable
piece of talent.

09:23.367 --> 09:24.833
He should be put
to work already.

09:25.836 --> 09:27.036
Absolutely.

09:27.071 --> 09:29.807
Roger:
<i>Good work all around.</i>

09:29.841 --> 09:31.108
That's what I always say,

09:31.143 --> 09:32.909
this business
is about relationships.

09:32.944 --> 09:34.244
Bye-bye, boys.

09:35.246 --> 09:37.048
Ted:
Dee, we're done.

09:37.082 --> 09:39.618
Let's see them give <i> that</i>
to Bob Benson.

09:39.653 --> 09:43.123
We done here?

09:46.695 --> 09:48.965
I thought we had an
understanding about Don.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.067
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

09:51.102 --> 09:54.268
He's an exquisite copywriter,
if nothing else.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.906
He's gonna implode.

09:55.940 --> 09:58.344
That's a distinct
possibility, isn't it?

09:58.378 --> 10:01.345
On the other hand, you
might get some good work.

10:05.516 --> 10:08.152
( squealing )

10:10.490 --> 10:12.658
Hey, spud.
Get over here.

10:15.427 --> 10:18.864
- What's going on?
- We're playing "hide-and-go-seek."

10:18.899 --> 10:21.568
You hear that, Caroline?
Someone's hunting big game.

10:21.602 --> 10:23.770
And someone's looking for <i> you.</i>

10:23.805 --> 10:27.074
- Is Mommy here?
- No, Daddy and Nana.

10:27.108 --> 10:30.244
They're in there.
Ellery and I are supposed to "go play."

10:30.279 --> 10:32.447
See ya later, alligator.

10:34.215 --> 10:36.017
( rattles )

10:38.924 --> 10:40.991
Mona, Brooks.

10:41.025 --> 10:43.895
What a pleasant surprise.

10:43.929 --> 10:47.132
Mona: - Margaret's run away.
- To where? Bergdorf's?

10:47.166 --> 10:49.269
It's not a joke.
She's upstate

10:49.303 --> 10:50.936
with some sort of
religious cult.

10:50.971 --> 10:53.036
- What?
- It's a commune.

10:53.071 --> 10:55.472
Mona: - You don't know that.
- What the hell happened?

10:55.506 --> 10:57.007
I can't get a straight story.

10:57.041 --> 10:58.741
Because I don't know
why you need to know.

10:58.776 --> 11:00.607
Apparently, she
woke up one morning

11:00.641 --> 11:03.474
and got in a van with some
hippies that she barely knew.

11:03.509 --> 11:05.010
She's only been gone
a few days.

11:05.044 --> 11:06.812
10. Brooks and I
think it best

11:06.847 --> 11:09.246
if you go up there
and retrieve her.

11:09.281 --> 11:10.917
The only reason I even told you

11:10.952 --> 11:12.622
is because I need someone
to watch my son,

11:12.656 --> 11:15.022
and I thought it best
it be family.

11:15.057 --> 11:17.755
If you don't want to do it, I've got
a long list of strangers I can pay.

11:17.789 --> 11:19.687
You're upset.

11:19.721 --> 11:22.658
You're not thinking right.

11:22.692 --> 11:25.491
We can't help you if you
don't tell us what happened.

11:29.994 --> 11:32.796
Look, she hasn't
been herself lately

11:32.830 --> 11:36.299
and we went to this
marriage encounter group.

11:36.334 --> 11:38.101
( chuckles )
You're kidding.

11:38.135 --> 11:39.803
She wanted to, and I thought

11:39.838 --> 11:41.572
it would be good for her
to talk to people.

11:41.606 --> 11:43.006
That's always a mistake.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.642
Roger!

11:45.676 --> 11:48.146
Brooks, sweetheart,

11:48.180 --> 11:50.346
I don't mind watching
my grandson,

11:50.380 --> 11:51.914
but it sounds like
you tried to stop her

11:51.948 --> 11:53.918
and you obviously failed.

11:53.952 --> 11:57.024
- A father is a powerful thing.
- What are you doing?

11:57.058 --> 11:59.192
Of course, she'll watch him.
Let the man be a man.

12:00.893 --> 12:03.162
I appreciate that, sir.
I'm gonna go say goodbye.

12:03.196 --> 12:06.162
I'm telling him that I'm
joining her on vacation.

12:07.264 --> 12:09.499
Good idea.

12:12.936 --> 12:15.270
- <i> ( door closes )</i>
- What kind of a sales pitch was that?

12:15.305 --> 12:17.371
- That was terrible.
- I agree with him.

12:18.373 --> 12:19.776
She is off her rocker

12:19.811 --> 12:21.413
and she has run away with,

12:21.448 --> 12:23.681
from what I can glean,
more than one lover.

12:23.715 --> 12:26.450
I only know one other person who
would do something like that.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.119
How is this my fault?

12:28.154 --> 12:31.254
Because she is a perverse child
who only thinks of herself.

12:31.288 --> 12:32.823
Look, I know you're upset.

12:32.857 --> 12:35.260
I am terribly worried.

12:36.229 --> 12:38.998
It'll be fine.

12:43.469 --> 12:45.402
<i>( door closes )</i>

12:46.207 --> 12:48.375
( whirring )

12:48.409 --> 12:50.341
Harry: <i>Well, it was
a variety show,</i>

12:50.376 --> 12:51.677
and it featured this computer

12:51.712 --> 12:53.347
that was programming
the variety acts.

12:53.382 --> 12:55.318
And they had a lot of
psychedelic graphics.

12:55.352 --> 12:56.854
It was obvious that
whoever did the sets

12:56.889 --> 12:59.056
had never seen the
IBM 360, I can say.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.558
Lloyd: <i>Maybe I'll go buy a TV.
I can catch it.</i>

13:01.593 --> 13:04.461
You should get a TV, but it got
cancelled 11 minutes into the premiere.

13:04.496 --> 13:07.466
Tim Conway plays a guy who's trying
to kill himself the whole show.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.134
Probably to get out
of his contract.

13:09.168 --> 13:10.902
Don Draper, this is
Lloyd Hawley.

13:10.936 --> 13:12.503
- Lloyd's with LeaseTech.
- I saw you at the announcement.

13:12.538 --> 13:14.305
And what do you do
around here, Don?

13:14.339 --> 13:16.675
Oh. Don is,
uh, a partner

13:16.709 --> 13:18.211
and our creative director.

13:18.245 --> 13:20.615
I thought Lou was
the creative director.

13:20.650 --> 13:22.615
- We have two.
- We have three.

13:22.650 --> 13:24.315
I mean, there's Ted, too.

13:26.282 --> 13:27.850
You must have a hell of
a business right now.

13:27.885 --> 13:29.853
We'll see.
It's tough,

13:29.886 --> 13:32.817
because we both sell IBM's
product and compete with them.

13:32.852 --> 13:36.452
Who's winning? Who's
replacing more humans?

13:37.754 --> 13:39.955
Listen, I apologize
about your work area.

13:39.989 --> 13:42.121
It wasn't my idea.

13:42.155 --> 13:44.554
Look, I'm sorry
you lost your lunchroom.

13:44.588 --> 13:46.924
- It's not symbolic.
- No, it's quite literal.

13:48.193 --> 13:49.526
I'll talk to you later, Lloyd.

13:49.560 --> 13:51.326
Some of us have work to do.

13:53.161 --> 13:55.131
This is why I supervise
the installations.

13:55.165 --> 13:57.600
There's always
some kind of trouble.

13:57.634 --> 13:59.400
Don't worry,
that goes back years.

13:59.434 --> 14:01.200
Well, I go into
businesses every day,

14:01.235 --> 14:02.568
and it's been my experience

14:02.602 --> 14:04.071
these machines
can be a metaphor

14:04.105 --> 14:05.707
for whatever's
on people's minds.

14:05.741 --> 14:07.174
Because they're
afraid of computers?

14:07.209 --> 14:10.077
Yes. This machine
is frightening to people,

14:10.111 --> 14:11.779
but it's made by people.

14:11.813 --> 14:13.247
And people aren't frightening?

14:13.281 --> 14:15.351
It's not that.

14:15.385 --> 14:18.121
It's more of
a cosmic disturbance.

14:18.156 --> 14:19.990
This machine is intimidating

14:20.025 --> 14:22.727
because it contains infinite
quantities of information,

14:22.761 --> 14:24.029
and that's threatening,

14:24.063 --> 14:26.999
because human existence
is finite.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.834
But isn't it godlike

14:28.869 --> 14:31.204
that we've mastered
the infinite?

14:31.238 --> 14:34.038
The IBM 360 can count
more stars in a day

14:34.072 --> 14:36.238
than we can in a lifetime.

14:36.272 --> 14:37.706
But what man laid on his back

14:37.740 --> 14:39.876
counting stars and
thought about a number?

14:39.911 --> 14:41.977
He probably thought about
going to the moon.

14:45.479 --> 14:48.079
Pleasure to meet you, Lloyd.
I should get back in there.

14:55.983 --> 14:58.386
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.

15:01.054 --> 15:02.988
<i>( hammering fades )</i>

15:09.260 --> 15:12.263
<i>( faint drill whirring )</i>

15:12.298 --> 15:14.034
It's quite a view, isn't it?

15:14.068 --> 15:16.803
I like to think of myself
as a leader, Peggy,

15:16.838 --> 15:18.536
and that means
doling out discipline.

15:18.571 --> 15:20.903
But it also means tempering it

15:20.937 --> 15:23.573
with encouragement.

15:23.607 --> 15:26.909
Which should I be prepared for?

15:26.944 --> 15:28.779
I didn't hire you,
but I would have,

15:28.813 --> 15:31.685
and I would've paid you
as befits your senior status.

15:34.121 --> 15:37.923
I'm giving you
$100 more a week.

15:39.860 --> 15:41.831
I'm writing it
on this piece of paper

15:41.865 --> 15:45.265
because I've found that
saying things around here...

15:47.235 --> 15:49.204
is useless.

15:51.877 --> 15:54.409
Well, I...

15:54.444 --> 15:58.046
appreciate that.
Very much.

15:58.081 --> 15:59.848
Well, with it comes a mission.

15:59.883 --> 16:01.550
I'm putting you
in charge of Burger Chef.

16:01.585 --> 16:03.617
Really?

16:03.651 --> 16:06.117
Carve out hours for whomever
you want on the team.

16:06.151 --> 16:08.387
And Don.

16:08.422 --> 16:11.325
- Don Draper?
- He's the one.

16:17.228 --> 16:19.331
Thank you so much, Lou.

16:19.365 --> 16:21.736
Knock 'em dead.

16:21.770 --> 16:23.137
Have you told Don?

16:23.171 --> 16:25.472
You're in charge, sweetheart.

16:31.411 --> 16:34.511
<i>( tools whirring )</i>

16:39.016 --> 16:41.285
<i>( hammers banging )</i>

16:45.421 --> 16:48.190
- Is he in?
- He never leaves.

17:03.409 --> 17:06.277
Marsha, can you bring Don
and Mathis to my office?

17:06.310 --> 17:08.776
<i>Certainly.</i>

17:10.044 --> 17:11.679
- <i> ( knocking on door )</i>
- Come in.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.183
Please don't eat that.
You're so trim.

17:18.150 --> 17:21.188
- Anything else?
- Miss Olson would like to see you.

17:21.223 --> 17:25.092
- Send her in.
- No, I'm to send <i> you</i> in.

17:26.762 --> 17:28.630
Okay.

17:39.277 --> 17:42.114
- You wanted to see me?
- Can I offer you something?

17:42.148 --> 17:44.551
It was a long walk, but no.

17:44.586 --> 17:46.820
I have what I think
is very good news.

17:46.855 --> 17:48.622
I hope you'll see it that way.

17:48.656 --> 17:51.091
Hey, Don.

18:02.969 --> 18:05.271
I don't know if you've
heard the rumors,

18:05.305 --> 18:08.774
but Pete Campbell has gotten us a
presentation with Burger Chef.

18:08.809 --> 18:11.076
All I know is it's
national fast food.

18:11.111 --> 18:13.444
- They run a new spot every month.
- That's right.

18:13.479 --> 18:15.446
But we have to win it first,

18:15.480 --> 18:17.215
and that's why I wanted
you both on my team.

18:17.250 --> 18:19.485
Congratulations.

18:19.519 --> 18:21.986
Congratulations to you.

18:22.020 --> 18:23.953
Mathis:
<i>How long do we have?</i>

18:23.987 --> 18:27.220
I don't know yet, but I want
to get started right away.

18:27.254 --> 18:30.124
I think 25 tags
should get the ball rolling.

18:30.158 --> 18:32.160
- I'll get right on it.
- Apiece.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.196
That's 50 total
between the two of you.

18:40.239 --> 18:43.411
- What's the strategy?
- Lou likes to start with the tags

18:43.446 --> 18:45.580
and then sneak up
on a strategy.

18:45.615 --> 18:47.316
You'll get used to it.

18:49.453 --> 18:52.420
Well, that'll do it.

18:56.156 --> 18:59.060
- Thanks for thinking of me.
- I look forward to your work.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.063
Monday.

19:02.697 --> 19:05.064
<i>( door closes )</i>

19:08.037 --> 19:10.304

19:12.941 --> 19:15.044
( thumps )

19:24.359 --> 19:26.128
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

19:43.975 --> 19:46.343
- How was your weekend?
Don: - Lonely.

19:46.377 --> 19:48.712
- How was yours?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

19:50.512 --> 19:53.984
Oh, I'm sorry. You have a
meeting with Miss Olson,

19:54.018 --> 19:57.286
and the Burger Chef
research came in.

20:07.668 --> 20:09.301
- Is he in?
- Yes.

20:10.304 --> 20:12.438
Good.

20:24.611 --> 20:26.044
Oh, good.

20:26.078 --> 20:27.378
Don't act like you
were looking for me.

20:27.412 --> 20:28.911
I was looking for you.

20:28.945 --> 20:30.981
I need coffee.
I didn't sleep last night.

20:31.016 --> 20:32.682
Well, Mona called,

20:32.717 --> 20:35.685
and I'm supposed
to read you this message.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.220
"Hey, genius!
Brooks is in jail in Kingston."

20:43.655 --> 20:45.688
From now on, you don't listen
to her, you listen to me.

20:50.958 --> 20:53.958
And what I really like
is no matter what you order,

20:53.993 --> 20:55.426
they give you
a side of spaghetti,

20:55.460 --> 20:57.126
even if you order spaghetti.

20:57.161 --> 20:58.495
What, Burger Chef does?

20:58.530 --> 21:00.432
No, Vito's.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.202
I can go get him.

21:13.084 --> 21:14.887
Don:
<i>Come in.</i>

21:17.895 --> 21:19.928
It's time for the meeting.

21:19.962 --> 21:22.030
I can't make it.

21:22.064 --> 21:24.332
Oh.

21:24.366 --> 21:25.734
Do you want me
to turn in your tags?

21:25.768 --> 21:27.068
Nope.

21:27.103 --> 21:28.636
Okay.

21:33.406 --> 21:35.707
He's not coming.

21:35.741 --> 21:38.478
- What?
- That's what he said.

21:39.482 --> 21:40.883
Is that right?

21:40.918 --> 21:43.718
I guess he's not ready.

21:43.752 --> 21:45.218
I mean, we did
just get the research.

21:49.661 --> 21:52.566
I would really appreciate a chance
to beef these up, as it were.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.035
I mean, if Don's
going to get more time.

21:57.539 --> 21:59.374
Here's a better idea.

21:59.408 --> 22:01.743
Why don't we move the meeting
to the end of the day,

22:01.777 --> 22:04.681
and you give me what you've
got now plus 25 more?

22:04.715 --> 22:07.213
That's going to be 50.

22:07.247 --> 22:09.012
But now you have the research.

22:22.561 --> 22:24.762
<i>( bangs glove box )</i>

22:24.796 --> 22:27.600
- Hey.
- Nothing works.

22:27.634 --> 22:29.602
You need to calm down.
I don't want this

22:29.636 --> 22:31.603
turning into "The Guiding
Light" the moment we get there.

22:31.638 --> 22:34.306
Ha. I'm worried,
but you're angry.

22:34.340 --> 22:36.241
Don't lose your temper.

22:36.275 --> 22:37.676
How much cash do you have?

22:37.710 --> 22:39.543
Why don't you reach in
and check?

22:40.645 --> 22:42.242
His bail is 180.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.276
Let Brooks spend another day
in the slammer.

22:44.311 --> 22:46.611
- He'll just get in the way.
- No, obviously.

22:46.646 --> 22:48.847
I meant we should spring
him on the way back.

22:48.882 --> 22:51.521
He's a bum. If he wasn't a bum,
she wouldn't have left him.

22:51.555 --> 22:54.023
She told him she was
never leaving that place

22:54.058 --> 22:55.525
and that he and Ellery
could stay there.

22:55.560 --> 22:57.426
And what was he supposed to do?

22:57.460 --> 22:59.092
He was supposed to get into
a fight with those hippies,

22:59.127 --> 23:01.562
not some rednecks in a
bar three hours later.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.032
It's my fault.

23:04.067 --> 23:05.835
I always let her
out of everything.

23:05.869 --> 23:08.639
She only had one job and
that was to find a husband,

23:08.673 --> 23:11.610
- and she mucked it up.
- You liked him.

23:11.645 --> 23:15.380
I thought he was good
enough for the time being.

23:15.414 --> 23:16.915
( sighs )

23:16.949 --> 23:18.984
I wanted her to wait
like I did.

23:19.019 --> 23:22.453
You only waited
because <i> I</i> wasn't available.

23:22.487 --> 23:24.656
Well, look how that worked out.

23:24.690 --> 23:27.059
What was she supposed to think?

23:27.093 --> 23:29.694
"Things are hard, I'll
just find another man."

23:29.729 --> 23:31.763
That can't be it.

23:31.797 --> 23:34.603
Oh, God, I hope she's
not a drug addict--

23:34.638 --> 23:37.506
although they usually
stay in the city.

23:37.540 --> 23:40.910
- How do you know that?
- "Life" magazine.

23:40.945 --> 23:44.314
It's probably another man,
who probably has drugs.

23:44.348 --> 23:46.813
You and me is not
such a bad example.

23:46.847 --> 23:48.816
I mean, what psychiatrist is
Ellery going to be telling one day

23:48.850 --> 23:50.785
about the weekend
his dad was in jail

23:50.819 --> 23:52.585
and his mom was in a commune?

23:52.620 --> 23:54.952
I'm sure you can recommend one.

23:57.321 --> 23:58.789
You know, I haven't
seen her in a while,

23:58.823 --> 24:00.156
because the last time I did,

24:00.191 --> 24:03.458
she was so cruel and so serene.

24:03.492 --> 24:06.195
She <i> has</i> been strange lately.

24:06.230 --> 24:08.263
And a little bit philosophical?

24:09.665 --> 24:12.435
Yes.

24:12.469 --> 24:14.671
( chuckles )

24:14.705 --> 24:17.539
I thought she was
finally happy.

24:23.429 --> 24:25.529
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

24:29.395 --> 24:31.628
Come in.

24:31.662 --> 24:34.029
Sorry to bother you.

24:34.064 --> 24:36.466
Do you have a light?
Mine crapped out on me.

24:36.501 --> 24:38.403
The perils of technology.

24:38.437 --> 24:40.571
It's 1969 and you're
unable to make fire.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.640
Human error.
Forgot to fill it.

24:45.644 --> 24:47.612
You're the only one here.
It's lunchtime.

24:47.646 --> 24:51.181
- I'm not hungry.
- Probably have too much to do.

24:51.215 --> 24:53.350
I'm not doing anything.

24:53.384 --> 24:56.054
Look, I don't want
to put you out,

24:56.088 --> 24:57.088
but if you have
a second--

24:58.324 --> 25:00.226
I have an advertising question.

25:02.431 --> 25:04.833
Go ahead.

25:04.867 --> 25:08.203
Advertising--
does it work?

25:08.237 --> 25:10.504
On some people.

25:10.538 --> 25:13.974
It helps to have
a good product.

25:14.008 --> 25:15.642
I'll tell you how great it is.

25:15.677 --> 25:17.812
I started LeaseTech
with two old friends,

25:17.847 --> 25:20.284
and six months later,
we have 19 new employees

25:20.318 --> 25:22.552
and three new competitors.

25:23.687 --> 25:26.121
Well, the first question

25:26.156 --> 25:28.691
is how is what
you're selling unique?

25:28.725 --> 25:31.293
IBM's leases
are short and expensive

25:31.328 --> 25:33.160
because they're always
replacing the equipment

25:33.195 --> 25:34.727
with the newest model.

25:34.762 --> 25:36.529
Ours are cheaper
because we don't do that.

25:36.564 --> 25:38.531
Don't yours become obsolete?

25:38.566 --> 25:40.900
They all become
obsolete eventually.

25:40.935 --> 25:43.570
The question is,
how long does that take?

25:43.605 --> 25:46.742
IBM doesn't care because
they just sell new machines.

25:49.011 --> 25:50.277
At this point, I usually ask,

25:50.311 --> 25:52.315
"How did you get
into this business?"

25:52.349 --> 25:55.451
Well, I was at IBM
for a few years.

25:55.485 --> 25:57.385
- I knew it.
- Yes.

25:57.419 --> 25:59.722
And I saw that they
have got a great product,

25:59.756 --> 26:01.692
but they don't trust it.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.759
I've worked
with these machines.

26:03.794 --> 26:05.394
I know how resilient they are.

26:05.428 --> 26:08.066
I don't want to find them
in a junkyard in two years.

26:09.737 --> 26:11.337
So you're betting that
they'll last longer

26:11.371 --> 26:13.472
- than even IBM thinks?
- Yeah.

26:13.506 --> 26:16.743
But the problem is, so are a
bunch of other companies.

26:16.778 --> 26:19.046
But they don't have you,

26:19.081 --> 26:20.982
and they don't advertise.

26:23.019 --> 26:25.452
Very nice.

26:26.954 --> 26:28.821
What's IBM like?

26:28.855 --> 26:31.258
Oh, there you are. I thought
we were going to lunch.

26:33.225 --> 26:36.093
Thanks for the light.
Pleasure to talk to you.

26:36.127 --> 26:39.563
You were going to give me the
name of a good keypunch service.

26:39.597 --> 26:42.600
<i>( door closes )</i>

26:47.737 --> 26:50.801
- When's Roger back from lunch?
- He's gone for the day.

26:57.410 --> 26:58.846
- ( knocks )
- You got a second, Bert?

26:58.880 --> 27:00.913
Of course.

27:01.914 --> 27:03.717
LeaseTech--

27:03.751 --> 27:05.623
the company that we're leasing
the computer from-- is a virgin.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.358
And I think we should
prepare a presentation

27:07.393 --> 27:09.825
while their guy is hanging around.
Push him over the edge.

27:09.859 --> 27:11.994
New business?

27:12.029 --> 27:13.764
That whole industry
is exploding.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.533
This guy has
exponential growth.

27:16.567 --> 27:18.536
Have you forgotten
the stipulations?

27:18.571 --> 27:20.338
Fine, tell somebody else.

27:20.372 --> 27:21.940
I mean, the apple
is right there.

27:21.974 --> 27:24.444
You have a fundamental
misunderstanding

27:24.478 --> 27:26.881
of what went wrong here.

27:26.915 --> 27:28.549
So, that's it? You want
me to be a janitor?

27:28.584 --> 27:30.517
Whistle while I work?

27:30.551 --> 27:32.453
You thought
there was going to be

27:32.487 --> 27:35.392
a big creative crisis and
we'd pull you off the bench,

27:35.426 --> 27:38.895
but in fact, we've
been doing just fine.

27:38.929 --> 27:41.698
So, why am I even here?
I could've gone anywhere.

27:41.733 --> 27:44.602
- Why <i> are</i> you here?
- Because I started this agency!

27:44.637 --> 27:47.607
Along with a dead man--
whose office you now inhabit.

28:01.790 --> 28:04.358
I left something in there.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.060
When?

28:18.373 --> 28:20.340
Thank you, Caroline.
I got it.

28:40.338 --> 28:42.739
( trickling )

28:53.252 --> 28:54.888
What are you doing?

29:15.812 --> 29:17.412
Are you looking
to buy some jelly?

29:17.446 --> 29:18.913
The stand's up the road.

29:18.948 --> 29:21.416
No, we're looking
for Margaret Sterling.

29:21.450 --> 29:23.487
Hargrove.
Margaret Hargrove.

29:23.522 --> 29:26.927
I know who
you're talking about.

29:26.961 --> 29:29.497
Marigold?

29:29.531 --> 29:32.869
She doesn't want any trouble,
and we don't want any trouble.

29:32.904 --> 29:34.839
Nor do we.

29:34.873 --> 29:36.673
These two are looking for you.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.575
You know 'em?

29:38.609 --> 29:41.412
Of course I do.

29:41.446 --> 29:44.447
This is my mother and father.

29:46.616 --> 29:49.522
- Mother, you look wonderful.
- Stop it.

29:49.556 --> 29:50.991
I know why you're here,

29:51.026 --> 29:53.895
and I just want to welcome you.

29:59.370 --> 30:02.071
Margaret, darling,
we just--

30:03.940 --> 30:05.641
Could you call off your dogs?

30:05.675 --> 30:07.577
I'd like to have
a private conversation.

30:07.611 --> 30:10.380
Hey, everybody, I understand
the dry cleaning's ready,

30:10.414 --> 30:11.749
but can you bring it
back in an hour?

30:11.783 --> 30:13.518
There's 50 bucks in it for you.

30:13.553 --> 30:16.820
I'm fine, everyone.
These are my parents.

30:24.068 --> 30:27.706
Will you let me show
you around at least,

30:27.741 --> 30:31.078
before you start railing against
something you don't understand?

30:31.112 --> 30:33.449
I don't know what happened
between you and Brooks,

30:33.484 --> 30:35.285
but your son misses you.

30:35.320 --> 30:38.587
Things have never been better
between me and Brooks.

30:38.621 --> 30:40.520
Ever.

30:40.555 --> 30:42.856
And...

30:42.891 --> 30:45.493
I miss Ellery so much.

30:45.527 --> 30:47.328
I think about him all the time,

30:47.363 --> 30:51.269
but he can't be happy
if I'm not happy.

30:51.303 --> 30:53.203
I didn't know how dire it was,

30:53.237 --> 30:56.003
but if you need money, whatever
you want, whatever you need.

30:56.038 --> 30:59.741
She doesn't want money.
Margaret, listen.

30:59.775 --> 31:04.344
Sugarplum, these people
are lost and on drugs,

31:04.378 --> 31:06.146
and they have
venereal diseases.

31:06.180 --> 31:07.683
That's not for you.

31:07.717 --> 31:09.885
You don't know them.

31:09.919 --> 31:11.853
And I'm tired of accepting

31:11.888 --> 31:15.057
society's definition of me.

31:15.091 --> 31:17.258
I don't pray to that anymore.

31:18.559 --> 31:20.726
Darling, I understand.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.861
Being a young mother
can be overwhelming,

31:22.895 --> 31:24.529
even with help.

31:24.563 --> 31:26.798
You sit with your child
at the end of the day

31:26.832 --> 31:28.933
and you're exhausted

31:28.968 --> 31:31.069
and you don't even know
what you did.

31:31.103 --> 31:33.504
And everything you do
seems wrong.

31:33.539 --> 31:35.838
It's hard to accept that
those are the definitions,

31:35.873 --> 31:37.474
but they are.

31:37.508 --> 31:39.512
I'm sorry you had
nothing to live for.

31:39.546 --> 31:43.282
I did. I had you,
and I was grateful.

31:43.317 --> 31:45.583
I'm grateful.

31:45.617 --> 31:47.320
I don't have to lock
myself in a bathroom

31:47.354 --> 31:49.290
with a pint of gin every day.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.025
I ought to slap you.

31:51.060 --> 31:52.560
Why are you talking
to your mother like that?

31:52.595 --> 31:56.365
Daddy, I'm-- I'm sorry.

31:56.400 --> 31:58.000
I'm telling her the truth,

31:58.035 --> 31:59.868
and she doesn't
want to hear it.

31:59.902 --> 32:02.002
Let's go!

32:06.747 --> 32:08.047
You didn't even
let me talk to her.

32:08.081 --> 32:09.915
There's no more point
in talking.

32:09.949 --> 32:12.149
I'd think she was brainwashed,
but there's nothing to wash.

32:12.184 --> 32:14.787
You can't make her turn on a dime.
You'll embarrass her.

32:14.822 --> 32:17.692
Fine. You want to wine and
dine the account, Roger?

32:17.726 --> 32:19.392
Knock yourself out.

32:19.426 --> 32:21.092
There's a four-year-old
in Manhattan

32:21.127 --> 32:22.426
crying himself to sleep.

32:24.192 --> 32:26.327
I'll get "Cletus"
to drive me to the train.

32:33.630 --> 32:36.100
( door slams, engine starts )

32:42.106 --> 32:44.542
Marigold!

32:44.576 --> 32:46.543
You want to show me around?

32:49.570 --> 32:51.903
( sighs )

32:51.938 --> 32:55.576
<i>( hammering )</i>

32:55.610 --> 32:58.047
<i>( saw whirring )</i>

33:20.409 --> 33:22.512
Hey, it's Don.

33:22.546 --> 33:24.514
Look at that, I got you.

33:24.548 --> 33:26.115
I didn't know where you'd be.

33:26.149 --> 33:28.150
You're here, there, everywhere.

33:29.688 --> 33:32.356
No, I'm not in the bag.
I'm in the office.

33:34.192 --> 33:36.159
Listen, let's go to Shea.

33:37.728 --> 33:40.328
Let's go see a game, I mean it.

33:40.363 --> 33:42.297
Is there a game today?

33:42.331 --> 33:43.633
You shouldn't have
told me that,

33:43.667 --> 33:46.537
because now we're really going.

33:46.571 --> 33:49.739
Okay. Your wish is my command.
I will not move.

33:51.341 --> 33:53.277
Can I hang up the phone?

33:53.311 --> 33:55.413
( chuckles )

34:03.722 --> 34:05.956
( groans )

34:10.293 --> 34:11.661
When you're done with that,

34:11.696 --> 34:14.230
one of us should
find some firewood.

34:14.264 --> 34:16.030
When he's done with that,
he's not going to be able

34:16.063 --> 34:18.567
to find his ass
with both hands.

34:18.601 --> 34:20.237
I'll tell you what, Clay,

34:20.271 --> 34:21.773
why don't we switch jobs?

34:21.808 --> 34:24.409
You want to get firewood,
help yourself.

34:24.443 --> 34:26.009
There's no hierarchy, man.

34:26.043 --> 34:28.478
Believe me, there's
always a hierarchy.

34:28.514 --> 34:31.315
We do things
by true consensus here.

34:31.350 --> 34:33.116
If we can't all agree
on something,

34:33.150 --> 34:34.916
we think of something else.

34:34.951 --> 34:38.422
Everyone does what they want.

34:38.456 --> 34:40.224
Good.

34:40.257 --> 34:41.525
Because I haven't felt
this at one with nature

34:41.559 --> 34:43.060
since I was in the Navy.

34:47.337 --> 34:50.136
Go ahead, it's dynamite grass.

34:51.603 --> 34:54.469
Now, I see why
we're eating so early.

34:54.503 --> 34:56.804
No, it's because

34:56.839 --> 34:58.606
we follow the cycles
of the Earth.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.273
It's gonna get dark.

35:01.706 --> 35:03.905
Electricity and all that?

35:03.940 --> 35:06.677
It just brings problems.

35:06.712 --> 35:08.579
But you've got a truck.

35:08.613 --> 35:11.546
Yeah.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.848
That's been up for debate, man.

35:13.883 --> 35:16.954
Doesn't it get cold up here?

35:16.989 --> 35:18.958
Margaret:
We light a campfire.

35:22.926 --> 35:25.897
And there's other ways
to keep warm.

35:30.968 --> 35:33.468
It's all right, sweetheart.
He's expecting me.

35:36.872 --> 35:38.974
Freddy, what
a pleasant surprise.

35:39.008 --> 35:42.848
- You know you called me.
- I sure do.

35:42.883 --> 35:45.115
- There's someone I want you to meet.
- Who?

35:45.149 --> 35:48.152
I want you to...
♪ meet the Mets ♪

35:48.186 --> 35:51.826
Meet the Mets!
♪ Step right up and greet the Mets. ♪

35:51.860 --> 35:54.360
Great idea.
Can you walk?

36:02.472 --> 36:04.004
Hello again.

36:04.039 --> 36:06.239
Meredith, we're off
for the day.

36:06.273 --> 36:09.875
- Way off.
- Okay. You two have fun.

36:11.277 --> 36:13.346
<i>( saw buzzing )</i>

36:15.785 --> 36:17.719
Where are you going?

36:17.753 --> 36:20.388
<i>( hammer rapping )</i>

36:23.228 --> 36:25.660
Don, I didn't hear you.

36:25.694 --> 36:27.460
No, I didn't hear you.

36:27.494 --> 36:30.063
Come on, Don, we're
gonna miss the game.

36:34.870 --> 36:37.005
You talk like a friend,
but you're not.

36:37.039 --> 36:40.341
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

36:40.375 --> 36:42.941
I know your name.

36:42.976 --> 36:44.643
It's Lloyd.
I told you.

36:44.677 --> 36:46.844
No, you go by many names.

36:46.879 --> 36:49.847
I know who you are.

36:49.881 --> 36:51.616
Don, let's go.

36:51.650 --> 36:53.118
Why don't you listen
to your friend?

36:53.152 --> 36:55.319
You don't need a campaign.

36:55.354 --> 36:57.520
You've had the best campaign
since the dawn of time.

37:00.122 --> 37:01.889
Pull yourself together.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.529
Freddy?

37:09.564 --> 37:11.365
We're knocking off early.

37:11.400 --> 37:14.134
- Okay.
- Ball game.

37:18.476 --> 37:20.545
I just wanted to make sure you
saw the memo from the partners.

37:20.580 --> 37:22.716
Your raise was approved.
Congratulations.

37:22.750 --> 37:24.518
What?

37:25.920 --> 37:29.392
Oh, yes-- thank you.
This office is so great.

37:29.426 --> 37:31.397
Everyone can just drop by
on their way out.

37:31.432 --> 37:33.833
Don't worry,
it won't happen again.

37:33.868 --> 37:36.336
Joan!

37:37.838 --> 37:41.171
I'm sorry.
I'm just having a day.

37:41.205 --> 37:43.873
I have exactly two minutes.

37:43.908 --> 37:45.878
It won't take that long.

37:45.912 --> 37:48.181
You already know the problem.

37:48.215 --> 37:50.215
Burger Chef's a big account,

37:50.249 --> 37:52.182
but they obviously thought
you were ready for it.

37:52.216 --> 37:54.148
They didn't want to give me
Burger Chef.

37:54.183 --> 37:55.883
They wanted to give me Don.

37:55.918 --> 37:57.553
What are you talking about?

37:57.587 --> 37:59.322
You didn't hear?

37:59.356 --> 38:01.324
Lou put Don on my team.

38:01.359 --> 38:03.560
To cowardice.

38:03.594 --> 38:05.262
Mine or theirs?

38:09.370 --> 38:13.541
He owes me work, and he's
going to the ball game?

38:13.575 --> 38:17.245
And there's nothing I can
do, and he knows that.

38:17.279 --> 38:20.212
Have you told Lou?
You don't know this,

38:20.247 --> 38:23.085
but there were rules
set for Don.

38:23.119 --> 38:26.787
- Is he breaking them?
- I don't know.

38:28.958 --> 38:30.260
( sighs )

38:30.294 --> 38:33.399
So, they just
dropped it in my lap,

38:33.433 --> 38:35.731
hoping one of us would fail.

38:38.402 --> 38:41.943
Well, Peggy, I don't know if
this makes you feel better,

38:41.978 --> 38:44.412
but I don't think they
thought about it at all.

38:48.650 --> 38:50.652
Roger: I can't believe my
little "princess and the pea"

38:50.687 --> 38:53.089
is sleeping like this.

38:53.124 --> 38:55.561
You never even wanted
to go camping.

38:55.595 --> 38:57.463
Margaret:
Well...

38:58.868 --> 39:02.140
I used to think
the country was lonely.

39:02.174 --> 39:05.176
Now I realize the city is.

39:05.211 --> 39:08.044
I mean, look at that.

39:11.886 --> 39:14.487
It's beautiful.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.652
You think we'll put
a man up there?

39:16.686 --> 39:19.024
With all the brainpower
around here?

39:19.058 --> 39:22.496
I'm certain you'll put
a man on the roof.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.664
I'd like to go to the moon.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.837
Well, I guess if you can make
an allowance for a truck,

39:30.871 --> 39:33.205
you can make an allowance
for a rocket.

39:33.240 --> 39:35.175
Don't you want to go?

39:35.209 --> 39:37.044
Of course.

39:37.079 --> 39:39.279
Every little boy
wants to be an astronaut.

39:39.314 --> 39:42.348
Astronauts didn't exist
when you were a little boy.

39:42.383 --> 39:44.854
Jules Verne--

39:44.888 --> 39:47.020
"From the Earth
to the Moon."

39:47.055 --> 39:50.188
You read that to me.

39:50.223 --> 39:52.659
They shot a cannon into space.

39:52.693 --> 39:55.830
I don't think so.

39:55.865 --> 39:57.664
Must've been your mother.

40:08.245 --> 40:10.615
I'm really happy here, Daddy.

40:15.051 --> 40:17.053
I know.

40:34.911 --> 40:37.743
Oop, oop...

40:37.777 --> 40:39.679
Get my binoculars.
They're in the hallway closet.

40:39.713 --> 40:41.581
Good idea.

40:43.284 --> 40:45.615
We're going to miss
the national anthem.

40:55.457 --> 40:58.091
<i>( door closes )</i>

40:58.125 --> 41:00.995
<i>( Margaret giggling )</i>
<i>Stop it, not here.</i>

41:15.310 --> 41:18.179
( sighs )

41:20.655 --> 41:22.889
<i>( car horn honks )</i>

41:25.192 --> 41:27.693
Come on.

41:27.728 --> 41:30.196
It's as black and strong
as Jack Johnson.

41:35.368 --> 41:37.669
Thank you.

41:38.671 --> 41:40.705
How'd you get in?

41:40.739 --> 41:44.208
I'm glad you passed out.
I got a lot less to explain.

41:46.144 --> 41:48.712
Did the Mets win?

41:51.849 --> 41:53.683
What the hell are you doing?

41:53.718 --> 41:55.318
Aren't they giving you
a second chance?

41:55.353 --> 41:57.554
They weren't serious about it.

41:57.588 --> 41:59.822
They finally gave me
something to do,

41:59.857 --> 42:03.192
and it was write
25 tags for Peggy.

42:03.226 --> 42:06.562
- What's the account?
- Burger Chef.

42:06.596 --> 42:09.331
Hm-- Peggy.

42:09.365 --> 42:11.366
Have you been
to the restaurant yet?

42:11.400 --> 42:14.169
What, and have some pimply kid

42:14.203 --> 42:16.371
who should be writing taglines
hand me a milk shake?

42:16.405 --> 42:17.638
How would you rather have it?

42:17.673 --> 42:19.373
Would you rather be
in my situation--

42:19.408 --> 42:20.875
bouncing from office to office?

42:20.909 --> 42:23.177
"Ding-dong,
Don Draper calling."

42:23.211 --> 42:24.711
I want my job back.

42:24.746 --> 42:26.213
How the hell do you think
that's going to happen

42:26.247 --> 42:28.648
when you're at
the bottom of a bottle?

42:28.683 --> 42:30.550
You know you never have to
have another drink again.

42:30.584 --> 42:32.485
I don't want to hear
that right now.

42:32.520 --> 42:34.587
You're hungover. It's the
best time to hear it.

42:36.290 --> 42:38.591
I mean, are you
just going to kill yourself?

42:38.625 --> 42:40.926
Give them what they want?

42:40.961 --> 42:43.862
Or go in your bedroom,
get in uniform,

42:43.897 --> 42:47.232
fix your bayonet,
and hit the parade?

42:48.267 --> 42:50.101
Do the work, Don.

42:59.711 --> 43:02.079
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

43:08.653 --> 43:10.454
You're up early.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.122
Where's my daughter?

43:12.156 --> 43:15.025
She's probably at the
creek getting water.

43:15.059 --> 43:16.327
I don't think so.

43:17.930 --> 43:20.935
It's a beautiful night
and a beautiful morning.

43:22.071 --> 43:23.405
Did you see the sunrise?

43:28.512 --> 43:30.747
It's a beautiful
morning, isn't it?

43:30.781 --> 43:32.449
It's time to leave
Shangri-La, baby.

43:32.483 --> 43:34.952
Take a good look, say
goodbye to your friends.

43:34.986 --> 43:36.954
You were doing so well, Daddy.

43:36.988 --> 43:38.723
Fine, you don't want to say goodbye?
Let's go.

43:38.757 --> 43:41.426
Hey, man, leave her be.

43:41.460 --> 43:43.962
Come on, Sprout, feel like
driving the truck today?

43:43.996 --> 43:47.032
No one's going to help you
take me away from here.

43:47.066 --> 43:49.201
They know this is
where I want to be.

43:49.235 --> 43:50.769
I don't care what you want, and
I don't care what they want.

43:50.803 --> 43:52.704
It's over.
Let's go.

43:52.739 --> 43:55.241
I don't know why I assumed
you were more open-minded.

43:55.275 --> 43:58.144
Well, I'm not. I
understand the temptation,

43:58.178 --> 44:00.112
and I know everyone your
age is running away

44:00.147 --> 44:02.782
and screwing around, but you can't.
You're a mother.

44:02.816 --> 44:06.119
- Ellery has everything he needs.
- He needs his mother.

44:06.153 --> 44:08.422
I'm sorry, but you
don't get to do this!

44:08.455 --> 44:10.523
Goodbye, Daddy.

44:13.160 --> 44:16.029
Let me go!
Let me go right now!

44:20.968 --> 44:23.203
( grunts )

44:28.610 --> 44:30.577
How could you just leave him?

44:30.612 --> 44:32.246
He's your baby.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.348
How did you feel

44:34.382 --> 44:36.650
when you went away
to work, Daddy?

44:36.684 --> 44:40.020
Your conscience must
have been eating you alive.

44:40.055 --> 44:42.423
Calling your secretary
from a hotel

44:42.457 --> 44:44.925
to pick out a birthday
present for me?

44:44.960 --> 44:48.162
I'm sure you were <i> sick.</i>

44:48.196 --> 44:50.998
It's not that hard, Daddy.

44:51.032 --> 44:53.567
He'll be fine.

45:19.995 --> 45:21.996
<i>( elevator bell dings )</i>

45:36.378 --> 45:38.413
You sure you don't
want a Danish?

45:38.447 --> 45:40.548
Nope.

45:45.254 --> 45:47.689
- Coffee?
- Yes, please.

46:02.204 --> 46:03.471
Good morning.

46:04.773 --> 46:06.774
I'll have your tags by lunch.

46:08.777 --> 46:10.945
Great.
