00:07.936 --> 00:10.135
<i>Previously on</i> Homeland...

00:10.137 --> 00:12.104
Why was Sandy Bachman murdered?

00:12.106 --> 00:14.373
Was it you?

00:14.375 --> 00:16.375
- You give the order?
- As a favor

00:16.376 --> 00:19.378
to the general, I agreed
to a chat, Mr. Berenson,

00:19.380 --> 00:21.046
not an interrogation.

00:21.048 --> 00:22.547
Quinn, I'm at the airport.

00:22.549 --> 00:25.584
I'm looking at Farhad Ghazi
as we speak.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.790
It's done.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.158
Good.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.994
- You said you found something.
- Several things, yeah.

00:35.996 --> 00:37.295
<i>I used the key you gave me</i>

00:37.297 --> 00:40.065
<i>to get into Carrie Mathison's</i>
<i>apartment.</i>

00:40.067 --> 00:41.400
Clozapin?

00:41.402 --> 00:43.301
The place is a fucking pharmacy.

00:43.303 --> 00:46.405
I'd say that the new station
chief is at least bipolar,

00:46.407 --> 00:47.472
possibly beyond that.

00:47.474 --> 00:49.307
You have a real gift for this.

00:50.577 --> 00:51.910
Hand-off complete.

00:51.912 --> 00:53.578
Hand-off of what,
only God knows.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.747
It's a hospital, Max--
probably drugs of some kind.

00:55.749 --> 00:59.084
So, you were just going to leave
without even saying good-bye?

00:59.086 --> 01:00.819
Aayan's passport
has a signaling antenna.

01:00.821 --> 01:02.320
We're following him
to the border.

01:02.322 --> 01:04.089
Yeah?

01:04.090 --> 01:05.690
Hey, it's me.

01:05.692 --> 01:07.692
I had a lot of time
to think, and...

01:07.694 --> 01:10.195
all I thought about was you.

01:10.197 --> 01:11.763
I love you.

01:11.765 --> 01:12.998
I love you, too.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.232
<i>These men</i>
<i>are confirmed associates</i>

01:14.234 --> 01:15.500
<i>of Haissam Haqqani.</i>

01:15.502 --> 01:17.436
If the target appears,
we will take him out.

01:17.438 --> 01:19.604
That's him right there.

01:19.606 --> 01:20.839
Armed?

01:20.841 --> 01:21.840
Arming.

01:21.842 --> 01:22.941
What the fuck?

01:22.943 --> 01:24.276
<i>Saul.</i>

01:34.821 --> 01:36.454
- Carrie!
- We're losing our window.

01:36.456 --> 01:38.390
- It's Saul.
- Reaper One weapons away.

01:38.392 --> 01:40.558
That is the ex-director
of the CIA-- do not shoot.

01:41.328 --> 01:42.594
Take the shot, goddamn it!

01:42.596 --> 01:43.895
Wipe that fucker out!

01:43.897 --> 01:46.398
Are you out of your mind?!

01:46.400 --> 01:47.999
That is Saul down there.

01:48.001 --> 01:49.200
Saul.

Mm.

04:17.688 --> 04:19.331
_

04:43.739 --> 04:46.239
- Mr. Director.
- Madam Ambassador.

04:46.241 --> 04:48.408
- Welcome to Islamabad.
- Good to be here.

04:48.410 --> 04:50.477
I wish it were
under happier circumstances.

04:50.479 --> 04:53.380
When are we expecting
the Pakistani delegation?

04:53.382 --> 04:54.848
11:30.

04:54.850 --> 04:56.583
I've got to say,
I'm not overly confident

04:56.585 --> 04:59.652
about securing their help
in Saul's release.

05:01.156 --> 05:03.256
I thought you should
familiarize yourself

05:03.258 --> 05:05.258
- with the talking points.
- Thank you.

05:05.260 --> 05:07.594
And I'm assuming you want to
meet with your people first?

05:07.596 --> 05:09.596
That would be ideal, yes.

05:09.598 --> 05:11.664
After you.

05:13.235 --> 05:15.268
Mr. Director, this
is John Redmond,

05:15.270 --> 05:17.270
the Deputy Chief of Station.

05:17.272 --> 05:19.672
- Yes, we've spoken on the phone.
- And Peter you know.

05:19.674 --> 05:21.441
- Peter.
- Sir.

05:21.443 --> 05:23.276
When you're done upstairs,
let's grab 15 minutes

05:23.278 --> 05:24.744
before the meeting starts.

05:24.746 --> 05:26.479
Excellent.
I'll see you then.

05:29.618 --> 05:31.518
Where's Mathison?

05:31.520 --> 05:33.052
She's sidelined herself, sir.

05:33.054 --> 05:35.522
- Explain.
- She was overruled in the ops room.

05:35.524 --> 05:38.391
She's feeling
understandably fragile.

05:38.393 --> 05:40.560
Overruled? You mean
when the decision was made

05:40.562 --> 05:42.695
<i>not</i> to take out
Saul and Haqqani?

05:42.697 --> 05:43.963
Correct.

05:43.965 --> 05:45.965
Which side of the argument
were you on?

05:45.967 --> 05:47.100
She was the boss.

05:47.102 --> 05:48.635
It was her call, in my view.

05:48.637 --> 05:50.403
You?

05:50.405 --> 05:53.206
She was under a hell of a lot
of pressure in the moment.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.208
Haqqani just executed
one of her assets.

05:55.210 --> 05:58.745
That another way of saying
she wasn't thinking clearly?

05:58.747 --> 05:59.946
- I'm saying...
- What?

05:59.948 --> 06:02.449
She let her emotions
get the better of her?

06:02.451 --> 06:06.085
No. Quite the opposite, sir--
she took a very hard line.

06:06.087 --> 06:07.987
Which you disagreed with?

06:07.989 --> 06:09.456
Yes.

06:11.259 --> 06:13.293
Thank Christ.
Where is she now?

06:13.295 --> 06:14.794
In her quarters, I think.

06:14.796 --> 06:17.497
Well, go get her.
This is no time to sulk.

06:17.499 --> 06:19.899
It's all hands on deck.

06:21.903 --> 06:23.636
Any luck with the nurse, Max?

06:23.638 --> 06:25.605
Got a partial read
on the name tag.

06:25.607 --> 06:27.574
I should be able to get a match

06:27.576 --> 06:29.242
from the hospital staff
database.

06:29.244 --> 06:31.845
How do we know the drugs
were for Haqqani himself?

06:31.847 --> 06:33.746
Because Aayan told me.

06:33.748 --> 06:36.249
But he didn't say
what they were for?

06:36.251 --> 06:38.418
No, he didn't.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.553
Yes, I should have asked.

06:46.795 --> 06:48.361
Go ahead, say it.

06:48.363 --> 06:50.363
What?

06:50.365 --> 06:53.099
I sent him to his death.

06:54.636 --> 06:56.669
We all did.

07:08.550 --> 07:11.184
Carrie?

07:14.623 --> 07:17.023
Carrie, it's Quinn.
You home?

07:20.195 --> 07:21.794
Carrie?

07:23.465 --> 07:24.864
Carrie?

07:31.673 --> 07:32.805
Hello.

07:32.807 --> 07:34.741
Carrie, it's Quinn.
Where are you?

07:34.743 --> 07:36.476
With Max and Fara.

07:36.478 --> 07:38.545
Lockhart's asking for you;
he's pissed.

07:38.547 --> 07:39.846
Oh, fuck.

07:39.848 --> 07:43.016
Uh... tell him I'm on the way.

07:43.018 --> 07:44.183
What are you doing?

07:44.185 --> 07:45.852
Trying to find Saul.
What the hell

07:45.854 --> 07:47.320
- you think I'm doing?
- Got it.

07:48.924 --> 07:50.590
Umme Kalsum.

07:50.592 --> 07:52.158
What?

07:52.160 --> 07:53.927
I'll tell you when I see you.

07:53.929 --> 07:55.662
Be there in 15 minutes.

07:55.664 --> 07:58.064
Call the second you locate her.

08:33.868 --> 08:36.034
Six, eight, ten...

08:48.617 --> 08:51.618
Six, eight, ten, 12.

09:24.753 --> 09:26.753
<i>An errant strike</i>

09:26.755 --> 09:28.955
on a wedding party...

09:28.957 --> 09:31.991
the murder of Sandy Bachman...

09:31.993 --> 09:35.261
and now this.

09:35.263 --> 09:37.263
Dysfunction
does not begin to describe

09:37.265 --> 09:40.066
the magnitude
of the problem here.

09:42.804 --> 09:44.871
That said,

09:44.873 --> 09:47.607
the people in this room
represent the last, best hope

09:47.609 --> 09:50.143
of getting Saul Berenson
back alive.

09:50.145 --> 09:51.177
Nothing else matters.

09:51.179 --> 09:53.112
With respect, sir,

09:53.114 --> 09:55.782
the order to keep
Mr. Berenson's capture a secret

09:55.784 --> 09:58.384
is hobbling our efforts
to find him, severely.

09:58.386 --> 10:01.621
Our agency--
yours and mine--

10:01.623 --> 10:04.624
is under attack
back in Washington.

10:04.626 --> 10:07.126
I won't add fuel to that fire.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.629
We're scouring the earth
for Haissam Haqqani--

10:09.631 --> 10:12.098
that's all anyone needs to know.

10:13.068 --> 10:14.467
Sorry I'm late.

10:14.469 --> 10:17.470
Where the hell have you been?

10:17.472 --> 10:19.706
Can we do this
in my office, please?

10:19.708 --> 10:22.341
We can do it right here.

10:22.343 --> 10:24.377
I have a lead on Haqqani.

10:24.379 --> 10:25.712
Mr. Director?

10:25.714 --> 10:27.847
- Hold that. What?
- He has a serious

10:27.849 --> 10:30.083
medical condition--
it's a good bet he's headed

10:30.085 --> 10:32.985
somewhere proximate to a doctor
who specializes in his disease.

10:32.987 --> 10:34.520
- What's he got?
- Well, I'm waiting

10:34.522 --> 10:36.055
for confirmation on that now.

10:36.057 --> 10:37.990
- And in the meantime?
- In the meantime,

10:37.992 --> 10:41.394
John and everyone in the station
will be killing themselves 24/7.

10:43.164 --> 10:45.164
- Yes?
- The ambassador

10:45.166 --> 10:47.934
wants you to know the Pakistani
delegation has arrived.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.270
All right, Mathison, let's go.

10:53.208 --> 10:56.109
Time to look these fuckers
in the eye.

11:09.057 --> 11:11.124
You realize I'm of
no intelligence value

11:11.126 --> 11:12.825
to you whatsoever.

11:14.763 --> 11:16.629
Did you say something?

11:16.631 --> 11:19.732
I have no value to you.

11:19.734 --> 11:22.702
Everything I know is
obsolete, out of date.

11:22.704 --> 11:26.038
Oh... but you have
already proven yourself

11:26.040 --> 11:28.708
to be of great value.

11:28.710 --> 11:30.443
How so?

11:31.412 --> 11:34.247
Here, now...

11:34.249 --> 11:38.117
riding in this car,
feeling the sun on my face.

11:38.119 --> 11:42.221
I can't remember the last time
I was able to travel so freely

11:42.223 --> 11:44.290
in the light of day.

11:49.497 --> 11:51.564
Do you have a wife?

11:51.566 --> 11:53.933
Children?

11:53.935 --> 11:55.635
A wife.

11:57.238 --> 11:59.772
I haven't seen mine
in over three years.

11:59.774 --> 12:01.841
Too dangerous for her.

12:01.843 --> 12:04.744
And for my sons and daughters.

12:04.746 --> 12:07.313
Can you imagine
what that's like?

12:07.315 --> 12:09.115
No.

12:09.117 --> 12:12.351
Not knowing if you
will ever see them again.

12:14.289 --> 12:16.155
I can't imagine.

12:16.157 --> 12:18.424
Well, now I know I will.

12:18.426 --> 12:20.760
Thanks to you.

12:20.762 --> 12:24.363
Praise God for sending me
a human shield.

12:29.137 --> 12:30.970
<i>Well, yes,</i>

12:30.972 --> 12:32.638
Minister,
of course we understand

12:32.640 --> 12:34.640
the position you're in
with the Taliban.

12:34.642 --> 12:37.476
Homegrown terrorists are
every country's worst nightmare.

12:37.478 --> 12:41.113
However, we also know...

12:41.115 --> 12:44.217
that you talk to these
people from time to time.

12:44.219 --> 12:47.620
We talk; we do not negotiate.

12:48.790 --> 12:50.122
In the past,

12:50.124 --> 12:52.124
you've provided them
with intelligence,

12:52.126 --> 12:53.893
sometimes even
weapons, as a means

12:53.895 --> 12:55.328
of trying to control them.

12:55.330 --> 12:56.896
Our strategy has always been

12:56.898 --> 12:58.965
to direct their actions
away from Pakistan.

12:58.967 --> 13:00.466
Weapons have never been

13:00.468 --> 13:02.134
part of that equation.

13:02.136 --> 13:03.636
Bullshit.

13:03.638 --> 13:05.304
Well, now is the perfect time

13:05.306 --> 13:07.306
for you to exert
some of your influence.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.976
That's easier said
than done, Madam Ambassador.

13:09.978 --> 13:12.044
Why is that?

13:12.046 --> 13:14.747
Saul Berenson is a prize.

13:14.749 --> 13:16.349
A big prize.

13:16.351 --> 13:18.851
What could my government
possibly promise Mr. Haqqani

13:18.853 --> 13:20.953
in return for his release?

13:22.590 --> 13:25.691
How about we stop dancing
around the issue, Minister.

13:25.693 --> 13:27.326
Excuse me?

13:27.328 --> 13:28.561
What the director is saying...

13:28.563 --> 13:31.530
Is that it's time for
a little blunt talk.

13:31.532 --> 13:34.100
No one on this side of the table
believes for a second

13:34.102 --> 13:37.737
that Mr. Haqqani pulled
any of this off by himself.

13:39.240 --> 13:43.009
What do you mean...
exactly?

13:43.011 --> 13:46.612
My predecessor was abducted
from an international airport,

13:46.614 --> 13:48.948
protected and secured
by the Pakistani military.

13:48.950 --> 13:50.516
And the ISI.

13:50.518 --> 13:52.351
We're doing everything we can

13:52.353 --> 13:54.186
to find out what happened.

13:54.188 --> 13:57.256
And if and where
security measures failed.

13:57.258 --> 13:59.525
And we thank you in advance for
your thoroughness in the matter.

13:59.527 --> 14:01.861
The point is, they
didn't fail at all.

14:01.863 --> 14:04.096
They were simply ignored.

14:04.098 --> 14:08.234
I'm not sure I like what
I think I'm being accused of.

14:08.236 --> 14:10.703
It's no secret that
there are elements

14:10.705 --> 14:13.372
inside your intelligence service
and armed forces

14:13.374 --> 14:15.775
who are sympathetic
to Mr. Haqqani.

14:15.777 --> 14:19.245
Just as they were
to Osama Bin Laden.

14:19.247 --> 14:22.548
Now, this is totally
unacceptable, Madam Ambassador.

14:22.550 --> 14:25.451
What's unacceptable is the
double dealing your country's

14:25.453 --> 14:27.520
been engaged in for decades.

14:28.957 --> 14:30.589
Minister, please...

14:30.591 --> 14:33.259
So, here's
what's going to happen.

14:33.261 --> 14:36.228
Either Saul Berenson gets
returned to this embassy

14:36.230 --> 14:38.397
quickly and quietly,

14:38.399 --> 14:41.667
or we put Pakistan's
$2 billion-a-year aid package

14:41.669 --> 14:44.170
under immediate review.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.847
Good day, Madam Ambassador.

15:14.435 --> 15:16.502
Who in God's name

15:16.504 --> 15:19.805
told you threats get you
anywhere in this country?

15:19.807 --> 15:21.340
Money always talks.

15:21.342 --> 15:23.142
You don't have
that kind of authority.

15:23.144 --> 15:24.443
But I do.

15:24.445 --> 15:25.878
On whose say-so?

15:25.880 --> 15:27.713
The president's.

15:30.184 --> 15:32.518
Why wasn't I told?

15:32.520 --> 15:35.254
I'm telling you now.

15:58.346 --> 16:00.579
A word?

16:07.688 --> 16:09.255
Saul Berenson said
you were smart.

16:09.257 --> 16:10.923
I believe he called me

16:10.925 --> 16:12.591
a "bright young man,"
which isn't the same thing.

16:12.593 --> 16:14.760
You were one of the last people
to see him before he was taken.

16:14.762 --> 16:17.029
Only because you sent him
on a mission to stir up trouble.

16:17.031 --> 16:19.698
That puts you at the center
of this, the epicenter.

16:19.700 --> 16:21.167
And Saul wasn't just
stirring things up,

16:21.169 --> 16:23.702
he was relaying facts--
fast, firm, fundamental facts

16:23.704 --> 16:26.072
- that you cannot run away from.
- Who's running?

16:26.074 --> 16:27.840
And the ISI hard-man he
told you about, that thug

16:27.842 --> 16:29.275
on the ground directing
Sandy Bachman's demise?

16:29.277 --> 16:31.010
That very same guy
was at the airport

16:31.012 --> 16:33.379
the night Saul disappeared.

16:33.381 --> 16:35.047
Are you all right?

16:35.049 --> 16:38.284
Do you always talk this fast?

16:38.286 --> 16:40.386
Oh, am I?

16:40.388 --> 16:42.521
- I'm talking fast?
- Very.

16:42.523 --> 16:44.056
You're upset--
I understand.

16:44.058 --> 16:47.226
No, "upset" doesn't
begin to cover it.

16:47.228 --> 16:48.561
Well, I want you to know

16:48.563 --> 16:50.096
I have no idea
who this hard-man is

16:50.098 --> 16:51.297
that you're talking about.

16:51.299 --> 16:53.199
His name is Farhad Ghazi.

16:53.201 --> 16:56.235
Check the passenger manifest.

16:56.237 --> 16:58.537
East India Air,
flight 223 to Johannesburg.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.739
- I will.
- Or better yet,

17:00.741 --> 17:02.575
check the CCTV tapes
from the airport that day.

17:02.577 --> 17:04.742
We've been over every inch
of that footage.

17:04.744 --> 17:06.612
What,<i> you</i> have?

17:06.614 --> 17:07.746
Forensics has.

17:07.748 --> 17:09.281
ISI forensics?

17:09.282 --> 17:10.915
- Yes.
- Right.

17:10.917 --> 17:12.818
So you see my problem.

17:13.788 --> 17:15.988
More accusations.

17:15.990 --> 17:19.224
So prove me wrong--
show me those tapes.

17:22.964 --> 17:24.430
Fine.

17:24.432 --> 17:26.464
No, I mean all of them.

17:26.467 --> 17:28.501
- We can go there right now.
- Go where?

17:28.502 --> 17:30.669
To the airport.
My driver will take us.

17:32.173 --> 17:34.306
I need 30 minutes.
I'll meet you there.

17:34.308 --> 17:35.441
Terminal three.

17:35.443 --> 17:36.842
Right next to Customs.

18:18.152 --> 18:20.519
Hey there.

18:20.521 --> 18:22.087
Sir.

18:26.794 --> 18:28.294
What are you doing?

18:28.296 --> 18:30.629
Drafting a letter
of resignation.

18:33.201 --> 18:36.702
You, uh...
sure you want to do that?

18:36.704 --> 18:38.003
It's not even a question.

18:38.005 --> 18:39.972
My position here
is no longer tenable.

18:46.681 --> 18:49.014
Why? What happened?

18:49.016 --> 18:51.517
Another example of the State
Department being dialed out

18:51.519 --> 18:53.519
of a foreign policy debate.

18:53.521 --> 18:54.820
Tell me.

18:54.822 --> 18:56.989
Every single one
of the White House's

18:56.991 --> 18:59.325
assurances to me
just went out the window.

18:59.327 --> 19:01.827
- You're exaggerating, Martha.
- Am I? The president's

19:01.829 --> 19:04.230
using the aid package
to leverage Saul's release.

19:04.232 --> 19:06.398
- So?
- Without consulting me.

19:06.400 --> 19:08.234
Without informing me.

19:08.236 --> 19:10.903
The first I heard of it
was in front of the delegation.

19:10.905 --> 19:14.039
- And? - I was made to look like
a complete asshole, Dennis.

19:14.041 --> 19:15.674
Small price to pay,
don't you think,

19:15.676 --> 19:17.009
if it gets Saul back?

19:17.011 --> 19:19.011
The sheer incompetence.

19:19.013 --> 19:21.347
Andrew Lockhart opens his mouth
and proceeds to undermine

19:21.349 --> 19:23.849
every important relationship
I've made here.

19:23.851 --> 19:25.618
So rebuild them.

19:25.620 --> 19:28.053
You're good, Martha--
you can do that.

19:28.055 --> 19:30.623
But you will not
give up your life's work.

19:30.625 --> 19:33.192
I won't let you.

19:36.130 --> 19:39.498
I thought leaving here
would be music to your ears.

19:41.435 --> 19:43.769
Thought you hated Pakistan.

19:45.740 --> 19:48.574
I don't know.

19:48.576 --> 19:51.443
Maybe it's starting
to grow on me.

19:57.418 --> 19:59.618
You asleep?

19:59.620 --> 20:01.687
Hardly.

20:03.424 --> 20:06.792
You're gonna have to talk to me
sooner or later.

20:12.133 --> 20:15.401
I get why you did
what you did, believe me.

20:15.403 --> 20:17.102
Oh, you do?

20:17.104 --> 20:19.571
Yeah.

20:19.573 --> 20:22.074
Which doesn't mean
I think you were right.

20:22.076 --> 20:25.411
Taking out Haqqani when we had
the chance was the correct call.

20:25.413 --> 20:26.612
Even with Saul in the way?

20:26.614 --> 20:28.614
Even with Saul in the way.

20:28.616 --> 20:30.616
Harsh as that sounds.

20:30.618 --> 20:33.152
Sounds pretty fucking harsh.

20:35.523 --> 20:39.124
The thing is, Saul would
have agreed had he had a vote.

20:39.126 --> 20:41.260
What makes you say that?

20:41.262 --> 20:44.363
You don't think
he's mortified right now?

20:44.365 --> 20:46.365
Humiliated?

20:46.367 --> 20:48.934
Mountains are about to be moved
on his behalf, lives risked.

20:48.936 --> 20:51.637
He'd do anything right now to
avoid that-- he'd put a bullet

20:51.639 --> 20:54.340
in his own brain if he could.

20:54.342 --> 20:57.042
It's not Saul I'm worried about.

21:03.317 --> 21:06.952
Truth is, I'm grateful not to
have him on my conscience, too.

21:06.954 --> 21:10.189
I feel shitty enough
about Aayan as it is.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.972
_

21:17.798 --> 21:20.666
Can we just jump

21:20.668 --> 21:22.167
straight to gate 46, please?

21:22.169 --> 21:25.070
Starting at 10:27 PM.

21:25.072 --> 21:27.072
I'm afraid that's not possible.

21:27.074 --> 21:28.674
Why not?

21:28.676 --> 21:32.211
The cameras covering gates 40
through 53 were down that night.

21:32.213 --> 21:33.812
Down?

21:33.814 --> 21:35.414
- Yes.
- Is that true?

21:35.416 --> 21:37.716
I don't know--
I wasn't working at the time.

21:37.718 --> 21:39.017
- But it happens.
- What happens?

21:39.019 --> 21:40.319
The system crashes.

21:40.321 --> 21:41.920
- Software trouble.
- Software trouble.

21:41.922 --> 21:43.856
What <i> do</i> you have to show us?

21:43.858 --> 21:45.591
Play it.

22:05.880 --> 22:07.579
So there's nothing
from the actual gate

22:07.581 --> 22:09.548
where Mr. Berenson
actually disappeared?

22:09.550 --> 22:12.050
- Apparently not.
- That doesn't strike you as suspicious?

22:12.052 --> 22:14.286
It strikes me as unfortunate.

22:28.602 --> 22:31.737
What about Farhad Ghazi?
You have any footage of him?

22:31.739 --> 22:33.772
We were just looking for
that before you got here.

22:33.774 --> 22:35.441
- And?
- Nothing so far.

22:36.644 --> 22:39.311
You warned them
we were coming, didn't you?

22:39.313 --> 22:40.746
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

22:40.748 --> 22:41.914
Where did they dump
the evidence?

22:41.916 --> 22:44.049
Hey, where's he going?

22:44.051 --> 22:45.584
Excuse me. Hey!

22:45.586 --> 22:47.453
What's in the briefcase?

22:47.455 --> 22:49.087
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

22:49.089 --> 22:50.122
It's empty? Doesn't look

22:50.124 --> 22:52.090
- empty to me.
- Just some paper.

22:52.092 --> 22:54.793
- Well, show me.
- Trust me.

22:54.795 --> 22:56.728
Nobody in here is
hiding anything.

22:56.730 --> 22:58.764
You have my word.

22:58.766 --> 23:00.632
Prove it.

23:12.947 --> 23:14.847
His lunch.

23:25.993 --> 23:28.260
- Find her?
- We've spoken to her parents

23:28.262 --> 23:29.862
and her supervisor
at the hospital.

23:29.864 --> 23:31.763
Nobody's seen her for two days.

23:31.765 --> 23:33.465
Have the police been notified?

23:33.467 --> 23:35.767
Her father was at the
station this morning.

23:35.769 --> 23:37.135
Everybody's very worried.

23:37.137 --> 23:38.871
Yeah, me included.

23:38.873 --> 23:40.372
We should
keep looking though, right?

23:40.374 --> 23:41.874
- No.
- Why not?

23:41.876 --> 23:43.876
Tell her, Max.

23:43.878 --> 23:46.311
I'd really rather not.

23:46.313 --> 23:47.813
Because either she's
dead and dumped, Fara,

23:47.815 --> 23:49.481
or alive and no one
will ever find her.

23:49.483 --> 23:52.551
So... concentrate
on Kiran Jafari instead.

23:52.553 --> 23:54.653
Aayan's friend.

23:54.655 --> 23:56.154
Girlfriend.
If there's anybody else

23:56.156 --> 23:58.323
who knows what that medicine
is for, it's her.

24:17.344 --> 24:19.411
<i>Da Kuhdai Ghesai Raghi.</i>

24:19.413 --> 24:23.749
<i>Da Kuhdai Ghesai Raghi.</i>
<i>Da Kuhdai Ghesai Raghi.</i>

24:35.696 --> 24:37.362
Sir.

24:37.364 --> 24:38.564
What is it?

24:38.566 --> 24:40.532
We got a green Mercedes
entering Miranshah.

24:40.534 --> 24:43.001
It's moving in the general
direction of Haqqani's compound.

24:43.003 --> 24:45.070
Get Mathison up here now.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.607
Look at this.

24:48.609 --> 24:50.842
It's a goddamn homecoming,

24:50.844 --> 24:52.945
right under our noses.

25:41.105 --> 25:42.660
_

25:51.385 --> 25:52.621
_

25:52.713 --> 25:53.726
_

25:58.721 --> 25:59.775
_

26:00.389 --> 26:01.606
_

26:03.225 --> 26:04.662
_

26:15.663 --> 26:16.862
Marwand...

26:17.021 --> 26:19.689
_

26:21.833 --> 26:26.213
_

26:26.550 --> 26:28.228
_

26:31.498 --> 26:33.172
_

26:36.553 --> 26:38.167
_

26:40.101 --> 26:41.380
_

26:43.323 --> 26:47.025
My son is apologizing to you.

26:49.953 --> 26:53.973
_

26:54.802 --> 26:55.901
Come.

26:55.903 --> 26:56.968
We go in.

27:40.714 --> 27:42.981
Is that them?

27:42.983 --> 27:44.082
Is Saul with them?

27:44.084 --> 27:45.651
You just missed him.
They went inside.

27:45.653 --> 27:47.686
Well, what's the plan?

27:47.688 --> 27:48.820
What are our options?

27:48.822 --> 27:50.322
Assets in the area?

27:50.324 --> 27:51.890
Special ops nearby?

27:51.892 --> 27:53.225
John?

27:53.227 --> 27:55.761
Miranshah's been
extremely difficult

27:55.763 --> 27:57.563
to penetrate, source-wise,

27:57.565 --> 27:59.998
and we haven't had ground
teams operating in the area

28:00.000 --> 28:01.900
since the airstrike
on Dande Darpa Khel.

28:01.902 --> 28:04.269
What about flying in a rescue
mission from Afghanistan?

28:04.271 --> 28:05.571
To do what?

28:05.573 --> 28:07.105
Uh, rescue Saul.

28:07.107 --> 28:08.540
Come on, Carrie.

28:08.542 --> 28:09.541
What?

28:09.543 --> 28:10.609
That's a major operation.

28:10.611 --> 28:11.877
Many, many weeks
of planning, at least.

28:11.879 --> 28:13.712
No, no, no.
It has to happen today.

28:13.714 --> 28:15.447
They'll be gone again
as soon as night falls.

28:20.087 --> 28:22.854
Well, you can't just dismiss it
out of hand.

28:22.856 --> 28:24.957
Abbottabad presented
far fewer challenges.

28:24.959 --> 28:26.725
That took half a year
to pull off.

28:26.727 --> 28:28.694
This is Saul
we're talking about.

28:28.696 --> 28:31.063
Three weeks ago,
the Pakistani army

28:31.065 --> 28:34.266
lost two helicopters and 80 men
in the same neck of the woods.

28:34.268 --> 28:35.767
It's impenetrable up there,

28:35.769 --> 28:37.703
even when they're
not expecting us.

28:37.705 --> 28:39.705
So you're saying Saul's fucked?

28:39.707 --> 28:41.640
And we do... what?
We just give up?

28:41.642 --> 28:43.075
Go get a fucking drink maybe?

28:43.077 --> 28:44.409
You're shouting, Carrie.

28:44.411 --> 28:45.711
No-- because we need
to figure this out.

28:45.713 --> 28:46.812
What, am I just talking

28:46.814 --> 28:47.913
- to myself, here?
- Hey!

28:47.915 --> 28:49.648
What's gotten into you?

28:50.584 --> 28:52.417
Nothing.

28:54.421 --> 28:55.654
Nothing.

28:55.656 --> 28:57.255
We all get the stakes here.

28:57.257 --> 28:58.590
Right.

28:58.592 --> 29:01.293
Yeah... I know.

29:02.763 --> 29:05.097
You know what? I just...
I need a minute.

29:05.099 --> 29:06.131
Take ten.

29:06.133 --> 29:08.100
Take whatever you need.

29:08.102 --> 29:10.168
Okay, thank you.

29:15.109 --> 29:17.576
Get me a dedicated line
to the White House

29:17.578 --> 29:21.647
and special ops pitches
from Kabul Station, ASAP.

29:21.649 --> 29:23.649
Maybe there's a way.

29:46.774 --> 29:48.707
Fuck.

30:03.290 --> 30:06.324
What were they shouting at you
in the street?

30:06.326 --> 30:08.460
<i>Da Kuhdai Gehsai Raghi.</i>

30:08.462 --> 30:10.996
It means Arrow of God.

30:10.998 --> 30:13.432
From my days fighting
with the Mujahideen.

30:15.169 --> 30:17.169
Please, eat.

30:17.171 --> 30:20.005
Thank you.

30:20.007 --> 30:22.140
So many years at war.

30:22.142 --> 30:24.176
Aren't you tired of it?

30:24.178 --> 30:26.144
I know I am.

30:26.146 --> 30:29.514
Well, you could've just
left us alone, you know.

30:30.884 --> 30:33.218
After you hit us on 9/11?

30:33.220 --> 30:34.686
I don't think so.

30:34.688 --> 30:36.188
Please.

30:36.190 --> 30:39.758
By all means speak freely,
but also honestly.

30:39.760 --> 30:42.994
We did not fly those planes
into the World Trade Center;

30:42.996 --> 30:44.496
Al-Qaeda did.

30:44.498 --> 30:46.264
You gave Al-Qaeda
sanctuary.

30:46.266 --> 30:48.166
You harbored Osama Bin Laden.

30:48.168 --> 30:50.168
Bin Laden was a Saudi.

30:50.170 --> 30:54.005
15 of the hijackers
were also Saudis.

30:54.007 --> 30:56.541
I don't see you
invading that country.

30:56.543 --> 30:59.010
We came here to kill or capture

30:59.012 --> 31:01.113
those directly responsible.

31:01.115 --> 31:02.681
And you stayed

31:02.683 --> 31:06.351
and stayed and stayed...

31:06.353 --> 31:10.122
and destroyed our culture
and our religion.

31:10.124 --> 31:11.523
That's not true.

31:11.525 --> 31:15.694
America despises
what it cannot understand.

31:15.696 --> 31:17.562
And your way is better?

31:17.564 --> 31:21.867
Only Islam offers a formula
for creating a just

31:21.869 --> 31:23.869
- and godly society...
- Your version of Islam

31:23.871 --> 31:26.872
is regressive and backward.

31:26.874 --> 31:29.708
Whatever the Prophet did,
we must follow.

31:29.710 --> 31:31.810
Subjugate women?

31:31.812 --> 31:34.379
Slaughter the nonbelievers?

31:34.381 --> 31:37.249
Strap on suicide bombs?

31:37.251 --> 31:40.418
I hardly remember
reading that in the Hadith.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.420
Be careful, my friend.

31:42.422 --> 31:43.655
You have taught

31:43.657 --> 31:45.090
an entire generation

31:45.092 --> 31:47.125
to live with one foot
in the afterlife.

31:47.127 --> 31:50.595
We do what is necessary
to win back our homeland.

31:50.597 --> 31:53.932
You just executed your nephew.

31:53.934 --> 31:55.300
And before that,

31:55.302 --> 31:58.904
you sacrificed his family
in an airstrike.

31:58.906 --> 32:00.972
How was that necessary?

32:04.645 --> 32:08.580
You point your finger at Islam.

32:08.582 --> 32:11.283
But if Christianity
is to be judged

32:11.285 --> 32:15.153
by the misery
it has caused mankind,

32:15.155 --> 32:17.756
who would ever be a Christian?

32:17.758 --> 32:19.791
I'm a Jew.

32:19.793 --> 32:23.495
Yeah, well...

32:46.620 --> 32:47.619
Hello.

32:47.621 --> 32:48.787
Hey.

32:48.789 --> 32:50.021
Did I wake you?

32:51.959 --> 32:53.325
What's going on?

32:53.327 --> 32:55.126
Kiran Jafari just started

32:55.128 --> 32:57.395
a 12-hour shift
at the hospital.

32:57.397 --> 32:59.798
Uh, what time is it?

32:59.800 --> 33:00.966
6:07.

33:03.537 --> 33:06.471
Um...

33:06.473 --> 33:09.541
pick me up at, uh... at 6:30.

34:15.108 --> 34:17.042
Sure, we could always get lucky,

34:17.043 --> 34:19.710
but risk to reward
on this is not good.

34:19.713 --> 34:20.911
Explain.

34:20.914 --> 34:22.147
Well, we've got to plan

34:22.149 --> 34:23.815
on them having a pretty
good idea we're coming.

34:23.817 --> 34:26.451
Which means throwing a lot
of manpower at the problem,

34:26.453 --> 34:28.152
which means potential
for casualties

34:28.155 --> 34:29.587
goes through the roof.

34:29.589 --> 34:31.389
Not to mention the fact

34:31.391 --> 34:33.391
they could just execute
Mr. Berenson at any time,

34:33.393 --> 34:35.860
and then what are we doing there
in the first place?

34:37.831 --> 34:40.331
Let me know as soon
as you have something

34:40.333 --> 34:42.100
you feel is viable.

34:42.101 --> 34:44.168
Yes, sir.

35:57.577 --> 35:59.244
Kiran!

35:59.246 --> 36:01.513
Kiran.

36:01.515 --> 36:03.014
My name is Carrie MacPherson.

36:03.016 --> 36:04.315
- What?
- We need to talk.

36:04.317 --> 36:05.583
Well, what about?

36:05.585 --> 36:07.886
I'm writing an article
about Aayan Ibrahim.

36:09.890 --> 36:11.589
You're the journalist?

36:11.591 --> 36:13.825
Yes.

36:13.827 --> 36:15.727
- I've heard all about you.
- Yeah, well, I...

36:17.097 --> 36:19.064
I need to ask you
some questions.

36:19.066 --> 36:20.498
Where is Aayan?

36:20.500 --> 36:21.866
Did he run away to London yet?

36:21.868 --> 36:23.034
- No.
- Is he still with you?

36:23.036 --> 36:24.436
- No.
- Well, where did he go then?!

36:24.438 --> 36:25.870
To see... to
see his uncle.

36:25.872 --> 36:27.839
- His uncle?
- To take him medicine.

36:27.841 --> 36:29.340
Are you sure?

36:29.342 --> 36:30.942
Do you... do you know
what this medicine is?

36:30.944 --> 36:33.011
- What...
- No, I know nothing about his uncle.

36:33.013 --> 36:35.013
Aa-Aayan... Aayan
bought the medicine

36:35.015 --> 36:36.681
from a nurse right here
in this hospital.

36:36.683 --> 36:38.783
Her name is...
Shit. Fuck!

36:38.785 --> 36:40.952
Fuck, what's her name?
Do... do you...

36:40.954 --> 36:43.455
Fuck! Do you...
Do you know this nurse?

36:43.457 --> 36:44.856
This nurse who
sold him the drugs?

36:44.858 --> 36:45.890
- No.
- Yes, you do.

36:45.892 --> 36:47.225
Umme Kalsum.
That's her name.

36:47.227 --> 36:49.194
That is her name.
Never heard of her.

36:49.196 --> 36:51.596
Excuse me.
What are you doing?!

36:51.598 --> 36:53.198
What, are you fucking
stalking me?

36:53.200 --> 36:55.200
You can't just come into this
hospital and harass the staff!

36:55.202 --> 36:56.367
She knows something.

36:56.369 --> 36:57.702
I need you to leave, please.

36:57.704 --> 36:59.471
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- Okay.

36:59.473 --> 37:01.206
I am trying very hard
to be patient,

37:01.208 --> 37:02.407
and I really don't
want to hurt you.

37:02.409 --> 37:04.409
- Oh, because you "care" for me?
- What?

37:04.411 --> 37:05.810
Do I have to listen to
that shit all over again?

37:05.812 --> 37:07.145
That's it,
you leave me no choice.

37:07.147 --> 37:09.547
Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me!

39:04.664 --> 39:06.397
No. No, no, no, no.

39:06.399 --> 39:07.498
No. No, I'm fine.

39:07.500 --> 39:08.499
I'm fine. Let go of me.

39:08.501 --> 39:11.336
I'm fine! Get off of me!

39:24.784 --> 39:27.185
In your estimation,

39:27.187 --> 39:29.420
are Haqqani and Saul
still in that house?

39:29.422 --> 39:33.358
Images from the drone are
unreadable at this hour, sir,

39:33.360 --> 39:35.660
so there's no way of telling.

40:16.002 --> 40:18.069
Do you know where we are?

40:23.176 --> 40:26.611
Three hours on dirt roads--

40:26.613 --> 40:30.081
I'm guessing somewhere
in the tribal areas.

40:32.018 --> 40:33.818
Eight miles that way...

40:35.288 --> 40:37.355
at the end of the valley...

40:40.260 --> 40:42.126
Afghanistan.

40:42.128 --> 40:45.363
The graveyard of empires.

41:14.661 --> 41:17.962
Come in.

41:17.964 --> 41:18.996
Sir?

41:18.998 --> 41:21.065
The ambassador's here.

41:23.470 --> 41:24.669
Okay.

41:24.671 --> 41:26.237
Turn on the light, will you?

41:32.178 --> 41:34.479
You heard anything?

41:35.982 --> 41:38.349
I want you to know that
your outburst this morning

41:38.351 --> 41:41.719
may have seriously jeopardized
four years of careful diplomacy.

41:41.721 --> 41:45.690
Given the circumstances,
it was hardly an outburst.

41:45.692 --> 41:48.893
And probably not all that
surprising to the delegation.

41:48.895 --> 41:52.764
So, have you made
any progress on your end?

41:54.434 --> 41:56.234
We're in a holding pattern.

41:56.236 --> 41:58.102
Langley-speak for no,
not really.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.574
It's an actual holding pattern.

42:05.712 --> 42:09.714
Would probably be good to have
the Pakistanis back on side.

42:09.716 --> 42:12.350
Probably.

42:12.352 --> 42:14.519
- Yes.
- Well, in an effort

42:14.521 --> 42:17.188
to mend fences, I've been
working back channels all day.

42:17.190 --> 42:18.923
And there may be a development.

42:18.925 --> 42:21.459
- Which is what?
- 15 minutes ago, I received

42:21.461 --> 42:23.027
a call from
the foreign minister,

42:23.029 --> 42:25.029
saying he might have
some positive news.

42:25.031 --> 42:26.764
And?

42:26.766 --> 42:28.366
He wouldn't go any further
over the phone

42:28.368 --> 42:29.934
but intimated he was
still working on it,

42:29.936 --> 42:32.203
and he'll be here at 7:00,
in person, to brief me.

42:34.207 --> 42:35.640
I should be at that meeting.

42:35.642 --> 42:39.477
But this time
we're gonna do it my way.

42:39.479 --> 42:41.446
Fine.

43:13.346 --> 43:15.346
Where-where are we going?

43:15.348 --> 43:17.482
No, please!

43:35.468 --> 43:37.535
Salaam alaikum.

44:13.673 --> 44:16.073
My apologies.

44:16.075 --> 44:19.043
Hopefully your stay here
will be short.

44:19.045 --> 44:21.646
What am I waiting for?

44:21.648 --> 44:24.215
For me to take back Afghanistan.

44:24.217 --> 44:27.652
Just as we did from the British
and the Russians before you.

44:27.654 --> 44:29.921
You and who else?

44:29.923 --> 44:32.323
You really think you're
the only one making a move?

44:32.325 --> 44:35.560
Different factions,
not just the Taliban,

44:35.562 --> 44:37.828
already gearing up
for that fight.

44:37.830 --> 44:39.830
America is about to exchange

44:39.832 --> 44:41.899
a number of important prisoners
for you,

44:41.901 --> 44:43.968
who I will return
to their provinces.

44:45.905 --> 44:47.104
As heroes.

44:47.106 --> 44:50.474
As servants of Afghanistan.

44:52.011 --> 44:54.078
Prisoner exchange

44:54.080 --> 44:57.682
on that level--

44:57.684 --> 45:00.585
they'll never agree to it.

45:00.587 --> 45:03.187
I told you...

45:03.189 --> 45:05.523
I'm not that valuable.

45:05.525 --> 45:09.060
The director of the CIA
is already in Islamabad.

45:09.062 --> 45:10.528
Sent by your president

45:10.530 --> 45:14.231
to negotiate your return
at any cost.

45:14.233 --> 45:18.202
It has already begun.

45:44.597 --> 45:46.430
What is this?

45:46.432 --> 45:47.431
What is this place?

45:47.433 --> 45:49.500
Where are you taking me?

46:11.624 --> 46:13.691
Oh, shit!

46:42.689 --> 46:44.388
Don't!

46:44.390 --> 46:46.991
Don't.

46:46.993 --> 46:48.659
Oh, my God.

46:48.661 --> 46:49.660
Hey, hey.

46:49.662 --> 46:51.562
No. No.

46:51.564 --> 46:53.564
Don't be scared.

46:53.566 --> 46:55.199
- Hey, don't be scared!
- No.

46:55.201 --> 46:56.801
Get the fuck away from me.

46:56.803 --> 46:59.370
Don't be sca...
You're safe.

47:02.175 --> 47:03.641
Come on, Carrie.

47:03.643 --> 47:05.710
Come on.

47:05.712 --> 47:06.977
Come on, Carrie.

47:06.979 --> 47:08.212
Carrie, look at me.

47:08.214 --> 47:09.380
Show...

47:09.382 --> 47:11.315
Hey, come on,
show me those eyes.

47:11.317 --> 47:14.251
Come on, open those eyes.

47:16.089 --> 47:17.922
Show me those eyes.

47:17.924 --> 47:20.224
See, see,
I'm not gonna hurt you.

47:20.226 --> 47:21.258
No.

47:21.260 --> 47:22.993
Fuck! Wake up! Wake up!

47:22.995 --> 47:24.929
Stop it! Cut it out!

47:24.931 --> 47:27.698
No, I...

47:27.700 --> 47:29.100
I was there.

47:29.102 --> 47:30.101
I saw you.

47:30.103 --> 47:31.502
You were dead.

47:31.504 --> 47:32.770
Your mind's
playing tricks on you.

47:32.772 --> 47:34.238
You've had a rough night...

47:34.240 --> 47:36.207
A rough night?
Are you fucking kidding me?

47:36.209 --> 47:38.209
It's over now.
It's over, I'm here.

47:38.211 --> 47:39.243
I'm right here.

47:39.245 --> 47:40.244
- No. No, no, no.
- I'm here.

47:40.246 --> 47:41.245
You're not.

47:41.247 --> 47:43.581
You're not. I know you're not.

47:43.583 --> 47:44.715
Why not?

47:44.717 --> 47:47.752
Is it so hard to believe?

47:52.425 --> 47:55.893
I want to.

47:55.895 --> 47:57.461
I w... I...

47:57.463 --> 48:00.598
I want... I want
to believe.

48:00.600 --> 48:03.167
Then do.

48:06.806 --> 48:08.873
Here.

48:10.276 --> 48:12.343
See?

48:14.781 --> 48:16.814
You...

48:16.816 --> 48:18.149
Yes.

48:18.151 --> 48:19.450
It's really you.

48:19.452 --> 48:21.118
Yes, it's me.

48:38.004 --> 48:40.638
Why are you so cold?

48:40.640 --> 48:43.674
What's the matter?

48:43.676 --> 48:45.910
You <i> are</i> mad at me.

48:45.912 --> 48:47.111
I'm not.

48:47.113 --> 48:48.112
Yes, you are.

48:48.114 --> 48:49.613
- I'm not.
- You hate me.

48:49.615 --> 48:52.917
You've come back to punish
me for what I've done.

48:52.919 --> 48:54.018
You're not making sense again.

48:54.020 --> 48:56.787
I'm making perfect sense.

48:56.789 --> 48:58.289
And maybe you're right.

48:58.291 --> 49:01.492
Maybe... maybe that
is the awful truth.

49:01.494 --> 49:04.361
Maybe I just need
to say it out loud.

49:04.363 --> 49:06.030
Say what?

49:06.032 --> 49:09.767
I was willing to let you die.

49:09.769 --> 49:12.203
Listen to me, I don't know
what you're talking about.

49:12.205 --> 49:13.804
No one has died.

49:13.806 --> 49:15.272
Yes, they have.

49:15.274 --> 49:17.608
Yes, they have.

49:17.610 --> 49:19.043
They have.

49:19.045 --> 49:20.678
Not me.

49:20.680 --> 49:22.680
I'm here, I'm right
in front of you.

49:22.682 --> 49:24.448
I'm right...

49:24.450 --> 49:26.650
Hey. Hey, hey.

49:26.652 --> 49:30.988
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

49:30.990 --> 49:32.356
Come here.

49:33.826 --> 49:37.361
Hey, come here.

49:37.363 --> 49:40.431
I'm here.
You're safe now.

49:55.414 --> 49:59.383
Oh, Brody, Brody, Brody...

49:59.385 --> 50:01.452
Who's Brody?

50:04.023 --> 50:06.090
Who's Brody?

50:07.927 --> 50:10.094
Shh.
