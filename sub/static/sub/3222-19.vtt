00:03.920 --> 00:05.504
Mr. Singer.

00:07.465 --> 00:08.882
Your time's up.

00:11.970 --> 00:13.429
Bobby. Bobby!

00:14.055 --> 00:15.681
Idiots.

00:17.058 --> 00:18.684
Bobby? Hey!

00:18.852 --> 00:22.479
You really wanna get stuck?
Turn into some ghost?

00:22.689 --> 00:24.148
I know what I'm doing, Rufus.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.275
You're thinking you can help those boys.

00:26.526 --> 00:29.319
But how many spirits you meet
in their right mind?

00:29.738 --> 00:32.656
What's it gonna be? Stay or go?

00:33.366 --> 00:35.034
I'm concerned Bobby might be
haunting you.

00:35.243 --> 00:37.327
- I've already tried contacting Bobby.
- Without me?

00:37.495 --> 00:39.830
If he was there, I'd have told you.

00:41.750 --> 00:42.791
We burned him, Dean.

00:42.959 --> 00:44.960
The blade was across the room,
then in my hand.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.713
My beer drank itself.
That page appeared on the bed.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.799
Bobby's book fell and out popped
the number of the guy who found Cass.

00:51.134 --> 00:52.593
- It's not Bobby.
- Could be.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.178
- No, it couldn't be.
- Why not?

00:54.345 --> 00:56.013
Because we want it to be.

00:56.306 --> 00:59.516
Regular people, they see ones they lost
everywhere too.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.311
- Yeah. Frigging ghosts.
- Or they just miss them a lot.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.607
If it was Bobby, he would let us know.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.490
Balls!

01:20.371 --> 01:22.372
All right, here we go.

01:24.501 --> 01:26.210
You know...

01:27.170 --> 01:29.379
...even though the world's
going to crap...

01:29.547 --> 01:31.840
...there's one thing that I can always
count on:

01:32.050 --> 01:36.970
These things tasting the same in every
drive-thru in every state in our great nation.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.390
Mm.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.901
- Annie?
- Hey, Dean.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.986
Nice surprise. How you been?

01:53.196 --> 01:56.824
Well, I'm still kicking, so good, I guess.
Heard about Bobby.

01:59.702 --> 02:01.495
I'm sorry.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.289
Yeah, us too.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.000
- What's up?
- I've got some of his books.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.336
- Thought you'd want them.
- Sure. Where you at?

02:09.503 --> 02:11.088
Bodega Bay. Crow's Nest Inn.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.548
- You working?
- Always.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.299
- You guys nearby?
- Near enough.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.344
Cool. Why don't we meet
at the Pier Front Restaurant. Lunch?

02:17.512 --> 02:19.763
- One o'clock?
- Yeah. Bye.

02:35.530 --> 02:39.366
- We shouldn't be here.
- Yeah, I know.

02:53.381 --> 02:55.090
Cops?

03:30.126 --> 03:31.668
You shouldn't have come here.

04:15.338 --> 04:16.380
Get this.

04:16.547 --> 04:19.841
Dick Roman is funding another
archeological dig.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.803
Guy moves more dirt
than the Drudge Report.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.681
Well, anything on what he's digging for?

04:26.557 --> 04:28.892
Don't you think I would've led with that?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.732
Annie's not usually this late, is she?

04:35.900 --> 04:40.320
No, never. She's totally compulsive.
I'll try her cell.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.074
You know, uh,
she and Bobby had a thing, right?

04:45.368 --> 04:48.578
Yeah. Yeah, I knew that.

04:51.249 --> 04:53.875
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:54.043 --> 04:57.170
Kind of a foxhole thing. Very Hemingway.

04:58.673 --> 04:59.715
Huh.

05:02.719 --> 05:06.596
She and I kind of went Hemingway
this one time too.

05:09.934 --> 05:13.061
All right. Well, that happens.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.608
- What? You too?
- It was a while back.

05:18.776 --> 05:22.654
We ended up on the same case.
She was stressed, and I...

05:23.072 --> 05:25.657
I didn't have a soul.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.785
That's a lot of foxholes.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.997
She's not answering.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.793
Well, here's to ghosts that aren't there.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.547
You sound kind of disappointed.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.758
No, it's better this way.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.636
And even though I wished we could see
him again, doesn't mean that we should.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.058
Ah.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.311
Are we being stood up?

05:55.396 --> 05:57.773
Yeah, let's hope that's all this is.

06:05.406 --> 06:08.116
- Nothing?
- Voicemail. Something's not right.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.118
What's she doing in Bodega Bay?

06:10.286 --> 06:13.121
She's working some kind ofjob.
She didn't really say.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.123
I need to get a refill.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.043
You know, man, why don't you, uh,
pack it away for a while?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.712
All it does is reminds us of him,
you know.

06:22.548 --> 06:27.427
Yeah, I thought about that.
But, uh, not yet.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.641
Let's go check out Annie's motel room.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.855
These go back years.
Disappearances never solved.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.149
They stop a few decades back...

06:41.317 --> 06:45.612
...then pick up again just recently.
All teenagers.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.490
Annie found a spot a lot
of them liked to poke around...

06:48.658 --> 06:50.909
...just before they went missing.
Yeah?

06:51.202 --> 06:53.787
Yeah. Old Van Ness house.

06:54.288 --> 06:56.498
It's, uh, cheery.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.917
The police combed the place.
They always come up dry.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.671
- Ah, local law. Always on the ball.
- Guys...

07:02.839 --> 07:04.840
Built in 1862 by the Van Ness family.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.968
- I made that curtain shimmy.
- Who lost it in the early 1900s.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.178
Could you look in the right place
at the right time?

07:10.346 --> 07:13.557
- It was for sale a few years back. No takers.
- Only because it creeps their queso.

07:13.724 --> 07:17.727
- Balls. This is exhausting.
- It's been sitting there boarded up for ages.

07:17.895 --> 07:20.439
Oh. Get this.
I guess a couple of months back...

07:20.606 --> 07:23.567
...someone put it on one of those
Most Haunted Houses in America lists.

07:23.734 --> 07:26.153
That's when the teenagers
started going missing.

07:26.320 --> 07:28.363
- Yep.
- Okay. Now, let's get rolling.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.949
I say we get rolling.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.584
Idiots.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.925
Thank you.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.141
Honey, I'm home.

08:00.938 --> 08:04.107
Jeez. My people.

08:04.609 --> 08:06.193
All right, let's go.

08:10.573 --> 08:14.826
Hi, I'm Bobby. And I'm a ghost.

08:16.078 --> 08:20.248
Looking for a little
ghost orientation here.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.669
Je m'appelle Bobby.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.715
Chilly.

08:31.677 --> 08:32.928
Annie?

08:36.349 --> 08:38.933
There's a whole lot of something
going on.

09:04.669 --> 09:07.879
I know what you did last night.
And you know it was forbidden.

09:08.047 --> 09:10.048
I don't brook that in my home.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.343
Don't do it again, Dexter,
or there will be consequences.

09:18.599 --> 09:20.559
The call to me was the last one she made.

09:20.726 --> 09:22.060
So where the hell is she?

09:22.687 --> 09:24.229
Bobby?

09:26.232 --> 09:30.610
- Annie. We've been looking for you.
- I can't believe you're here.

09:30.778 --> 09:32.612
Yeah. I'm a doornail.

09:33.030 --> 09:38.326
Bad news here.
If you can see me, you are too.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.880
Wow.

09:51.382 --> 09:55.302
Dead. Ghost. Me.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.430
Three words you never wanna use
in a sentence.

09:59.307 --> 10:02.350
- I feel like I was drugged.
- I get it.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.146
It was a month before I even knew
I was still here. You're doing well.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.564
Terrific.

10:07.732 --> 10:12.027
So, um, you duck your reaper too?

10:12.403 --> 10:16.031
What? No. I never even saw one. You?

10:17.199 --> 10:22.412
Bobby. You ran away from your reaper?
On purpose?

10:22.997 --> 10:25.206
That's why you're still here?

10:25.374 --> 10:27.584
You stupid, crazy old...

10:27.793 --> 10:30.170
Hey. I remember a time
you liked how crazy I was.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.340
Shut up. I can't believe you.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.719
You know what? As a regular ghost
with no choice in the matter, screw you.

10:37.887 --> 10:41.014
Hey, I got unfinished business here,
same as you.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.808
Uh-huh, and there's
my unfinished business right now.

10:44.769 --> 10:49.564
Kids? Hello. You're dead.

10:49.732 --> 10:52.067
They're not the brightest bulbs
on the string.

10:52.234 --> 10:54.736
When I came in, they were roadkill.

10:54.904 --> 10:58.990
Then this big guy charges me.
And now I'm...

11:00.743 --> 11:04.996
Crap. Is there a fun aspect to this?

11:05.164 --> 11:06.873
Not really.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.043
And so far,
I can't crack the code on any of it.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.922
I mean, I've seen poltergeists
bench a piano as a warm-up.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.342
I tried to help the boys out once
by knocking a book off the table...

11:17.510 --> 11:19.052
...and blacked out for two weeks.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.221
So Sam and Dean don't even know
you're here?

11:22.890 --> 11:24.933
Wow, that is messed up.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.188
Hey, Annie,
I'm e-mailing you those news clippings...

11:31.691 --> 11:33.525
We're redlining all over the place.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.236
- Assume the worst.
- Mm, always do.

11:36.404 --> 11:39.489
Okay, vengeful spirit,
maybe lots of them, killing kids.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.534
Look around. No blood, no anything.
Certainly no bodies.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.538
If evil is partying here,
it's got a hell of a cleanup crew.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.666
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

11:50.418 --> 11:54.003
- Here's something. From earlier this week.
- Okay.

11:54.171 --> 11:56.131
Free me.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.590
Free me.

11:57.758 --> 11:59.759
Where'd that come from?

12:00.219 --> 12:02.762
You ever seen a phone number
that looked like that?

12:19.530 --> 12:20.905
All right, that's cool.

12:21.282 --> 12:24.743
Excuse me. Hey, boss.

12:26.036 --> 12:27.537
Dick.

12:27.705 --> 12:32.000
Yeah, well, ghosts ain't the most sociable
type to come down the pike.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.545
But if he can do it...

12:40.634 --> 12:41.843
Balls.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.970
Graceful.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.347
Novices.

12:46.515 --> 12:49.601
You all make the same mistakes.

12:55.274 --> 12:57.525
I suppose you know all about it.

12:57.693 --> 12:59.527
Well, I've been at it 80 years.

13:00.362 --> 13:03.323
Yo. Uh, fresh meat here.
Not even sure what happened.

13:03.824 --> 13:04.866
Really?

13:05.117 --> 13:09.704
I got shot right in the melon.
Never felt a thing. You?

13:10.581 --> 13:13.750
I was stabbed. Brutally.

13:13.959 --> 13:18.254
Right here at this bar. April 17th, 1932.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.048
Who done you?

13:20.674 --> 13:22.926
I'm really very busy.

13:23.719 --> 13:26.054
How come there's so many dead folk
in this place?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.097
You know anything about that?

13:28.265 --> 13:31.684
Guess we're not supposed to
talk about that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:31.852 --> 13:35.396
Uh, my friend is a little nosy. Mister?

13:35.564 --> 13:38.274
Crane. Haskel Crane.

13:39.109 --> 13:42.612
Haskel, you're right. We are novices.

13:42.822 --> 13:47.408
So could you do me a solid
and show me how to move that chair?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.036
It's one stupid chair.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.249
Baby steps, gorgeous.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.543
Try this first.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.269
You're angsting at it.

14:14.603 --> 14:17.105
You know what getting frustrated
will get you?

14:17.273 --> 14:20.441
Ha, ha. Nothing.
You've got two ways to move things.

14:20.609 --> 14:25.113
What I did, which you obviously must,
is calm yourself.

14:26.448 --> 14:30.326
You're saying we should move crap
with the power of Zen.

14:30.536 --> 14:32.662
I'm telling you to let go of all that.

14:32.830 --> 14:36.082
Calmly tell the thing what to do.

14:38.377 --> 14:39.752
You're getting tense.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.672
You're not helpful.

14:46.510 --> 14:48.678
What's option two?
You said there were two ways.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.681
Oh. You could use explosive anger
and pure red-hot rage.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.517
But that's impossible to manufacture.

14:54.894 --> 14:55.977
Sorry.

14:56.353 --> 14:59.981
Makes sense.
Like poltergeists, vengeful spirits.

15:00.190 --> 15:02.650
I am vengeful.
You think I don't have red-hot rage?

15:02.818 --> 15:06.821
I think you're a sad excuse for one of us,
and I'm unsurprised that you're failing.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.700
Take my help or don't.
But if you want to move a flea...

15:10.910 --> 15:12.994
...surrender.

15:15.539 --> 15:18.207
For the record, I hated that Swayze flick.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.126
Romantic bullcrap.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.388
What in cold hell was that?

15:32.556 --> 15:35.850
That's you, one day. That's all of us.

15:36.018 --> 15:39.938
We deteriorate at different rates.
Some sooner. Some later.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.190
And eventually all...

15:43.108 --> 15:44.984
...like that.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.158
Nothing left at all.

15:54.578 --> 15:58.957
- Ghost Alzheimer's.
- I'm liking this less.

15:59.166 --> 16:03.169
Well, that is every square inch of the
place. No bodies, no pieces of bodies...

16:03.337 --> 16:06.839
...no Annie.
Whole lot of sizzle and no steak.

16:07.007 --> 16:08.883
Well, maybe no news is good news.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.218
Meaning?

16:10.386 --> 16:13.221
Meaning maybe she's just not here.
Maybe she's still okay.

16:13.389 --> 16:15.181
Yeah, and what does your gut say?

16:17.101 --> 16:20.311
Let's just see if there's anything else
in her research.

16:20.479 --> 16:22.021
Sam!

16:22.189 --> 16:24.774
- Dean!
- Honey, don't you think I tried that?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.484
I shouted myself hoarse.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.319
But I'm right here!

16:28.529 --> 16:32.156
Well, now you know how all the ghosts
who've ever tried to talk to us feel.

16:32.366 --> 16:34.158
You just have to wait until they find you.

16:34.326 --> 16:38.204
But I don't even know where I'm at.
And I've searched every room five times.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.332
No wonder they're walking away.

16:42.543 --> 16:45.420
Is it me or am I being checked out?

16:47.256 --> 16:50.758
No, stud, I'm being checked out.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.390
Can I help you?

16:57.641 --> 17:00.101
- I'm Victoria.
- Annie.

17:00.269 --> 17:03.563
I saw you here the other day.
I know the kind of work you do.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.607
- Did.
- Hey, I'm still doing it.

17:06.775 --> 17:11.069
- I mean, other-dimensionally speaking.
- Attagirl.

17:12.071 --> 17:14.991
Wait, your voice.
You're the one on my phone.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.577
When you were here,
I was able to call out to you that way.

17:18.244 --> 17:22.623
- Oh. Spectral voice transference.
- Right. Ghost juju.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.791
Sure.

17:25.127 --> 17:29.380
So, what exactly did you mean
when you said, "Free me"?

17:29.548 --> 17:31.049
Victoria. Free you from what?

17:34.970 --> 17:36.220
Bobby!

17:36.722 --> 17:39.932
Where did Annie get her intel,
do we know?

17:40.100 --> 17:41.893
Stupid flask.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.479
Bodega Bay Heritage Society.

17:44.646 --> 17:49.484
Boys, come on, all the action's back
in the pool. Let's go.

17:51.236 --> 17:52.361
Damn it.

17:53.614 --> 17:56.115
The house dates back
to the mid-19th century.

17:56.325 --> 18:01.204
Miles Van Ness made his fortune
in the gold rush, eventually settling...

18:01.371 --> 18:02.413
...in Bodega Bay.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.626
Anything unusual ever happen
in the house?

18:06.794 --> 18:10.254
Over the course of a century,
things are going to happen in a house.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.883
- Tell it what to do.
- Some locals swear it's haunted.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.344
- Move.
- Every village has its idiots.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.514
- But we only want the real scoop.
- Balls!

18:19.681 --> 18:22.683
Whitman Van Ness. Son and heir.

18:22.851 --> 18:26.813
Handsome, charming.
Dogged by tragedy all his life.

18:27.439 --> 18:30.775
He lost the family fortune, then the house.
It became a bordello.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.986
He lived in isolation
until his death at age 40.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.406
- He's still there.
- Who's the bruiser there?

18:37.950 --> 18:41.119
Dexter O'Connell. A convict.

18:41.328 --> 18:43.830
- An extremely violent man.
- He's there too.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.916
Mr. Van Ness was socially progressive
and took pity on him.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.377
He worked as groundskeeper.

18:49.670 --> 18:52.463
Dexter was convicted
for murdering Whitman's fiancée...

18:52.631 --> 18:54.799
...on the eve of their wedding.

18:54.967 --> 18:58.010
Another calamitous event
in the poor man's life.

18:58.178 --> 19:00.555
- Hmm. Well, thank you.
- Mm.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.767
- The house is popular this week.
- What do you mean?

19:05.644 --> 19:08.521
A lady came by the other day
asking all sorts of questions.

19:08.689 --> 19:11.190
- Uh, 30s, red hair, good-looking?
- Mm.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.027
I gave her the same advice
I'll give to you:

19:15.195 --> 19:17.530
Stay away from the place.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.407
It's extremely unsafe.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.124
So besides Whitman's fiancée...

19:28.292 --> 19:32.086
...Dexter O'Connell was also convicted
of killing hookers at the brothel.

19:32.254 --> 19:36.174
He escaped before they could hang him
but then returned to the house...

19:36.341 --> 19:39.093
...where he was found shot to death.

19:40.679 --> 19:44.515
Why would he escape, and then go right
back to the house where he got arrested?

19:44.683 --> 19:47.727
I don't know.
Add that to a list of things I don't know.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.855
- So, what's the next move?
- You know, if I could, I'd be getting old...

19:51.023 --> 19:53.191
...waiting on you two to figure this out.

19:58.322 --> 19:59.864
All right, now.

20:00.032 --> 20:04.619
I can kill werewolves, fix a Pinto,
and bake cornbread.

20:04.786 --> 20:07.663
I will be damned if I can't get Zen.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.001
We're posting this video
as a warning about...

20:12.169 --> 20:14.337
Or possibly a memorial to.

20:14.504 --> 20:18.174
Our friends Debbie Tellen
and Dudley Scott.

20:18.342 --> 20:20.968
- Last known whereabouts...
- The Van Ness House.

20:21.136 --> 20:22.762
Since the cops haven't done crap.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.307
In what may be the final moments
of their love story.

20:26.475 --> 20:29.477
They've been together since, like,
eighth grade.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.021
Yeah. They entered this house
and texted us.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.023
We're going in.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.329
- Sam?
- What?

20:48.538 --> 20:49.872
Tell me you wrote that.

20:55.003 --> 20:58.339
Uh, no. No, I didn't.

20:59.841 --> 21:02.343
They came into the house...

21:03.720 --> 21:04.804
Oh.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.682
Well, then who's there?

21:08.267 --> 21:10.268
I said, who's there?

21:33.417 --> 21:34.959
Bobby?

21:35.127 --> 21:37.044
They walked through...

21:38.213 --> 21:39.380
...these halls.

21:39.548 --> 21:41.215
Seeking a grotto of love.

21:41.383 --> 21:42.717
- Seriously?
- What?

21:46.221 --> 21:48.014
Bobby?

21:48.765 --> 21:50.141
Yes.

21:50.350 --> 21:53.394
This whole time we've been trying to talk
ourselves out of it, he's been...

21:53.562 --> 21:54.854
What's he doing here?

21:58.775 --> 21:59.859
Dude.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.737
We don't have time for this.
Get your asses back to that house.

22:02.904 --> 22:04.822
We gotta get back to that house.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.742
What happened?

22:13.457 --> 22:14.790
Hello?

22:18.795 --> 22:20.755
You shouldn't have come here.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.343
Dexter.

22:25.969 --> 22:28.888
I expressly forbid you! Enough!

22:30.891 --> 22:32.558
Thank you.

22:49.576 --> 22:51.077
Dexter.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.204
You tried to warn them away.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.206
You have enough of us.

22:55.665 --> 23:01.379
They're just children, Whitman.
I can't watch this happen all over again.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.966
Shut up.

23:40.669 --> 23:43.087
Oh. Victoria, grab the camera.

23:43.255 --> 23:48.175
No, I can't.
We don't meddle in Whitman's affairs.

23:49.302 --> 23:52.638
Hold it, let's get real.
You sent me the SOS.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.808
And now I'm here, so give me a hand.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.144
But now he can get you too.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.020
Get me how? I'm already dead.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.860
You wanna help me understand exactly
what did he do to Dexter?

24:06.027 --> 24:07.194
Punished him.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.946
He was trying to warn them.

24:09.197 --> 24:10.656
He tried to warn you too.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.617
He drained him.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.745
- Drained. What does that mean?
- It's why he's so strong...

24:16.913 --> 24:20.082
...and why you should stay out of sight.
We're merely food to him.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.668
Food and perverse entertainment.

24:23.837 --> 24:26.172
So when he does that...

24:26.381 --> 24:28.966
...what happens, just poof?

24:29.176 --> 24:30.468
Forever.

24:33.180 --> 24:36.557
See, I thought Whitman was some poor guy
and Dexter killed his fiancée.

24:36.725 --> 24:38.517
No. Whitman framed him.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.728
Whitman killed all of us.

24:40.896 --> 24:44.398
When this house was a brothel,
I worked here as a fancy lady.

24:44.566 --> 24:45.900
He slit my throat.

24:46.067 --> 24:47.526
Fancy lady. A hooker?

24:47.694 --> 24:49.069
Please.

24:49.279 --> 24:52.990
And now, even in death, every soul
he traps here makes him stronger.

24:53.200 --> 24:55.576
Okay, so where does he keep the bodies?

24:55.744 --> 24:56.911
I don't know.

24:57.078 --> 25:00.498
- Victoria, you've been here forever.
- You don't follow him around.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.129
Listen, we are going to pull the plug
on this bastard.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.423
Now, grab the damn camera.

25:11.510 --> 25:12.551
Oh, dear.

25:16.890 --> 25:18.265
It's him.

25:45.126 --> 25:48.337
We combed the crap out of this place. If
Annie's in there and we didn't find her...

25:48.505 --> 25:50.631
It's because someone didn't want us to.

25:50.799 --> 25:53.384
Awesome. Well, let's walk right into that.

26:03.144 --> 26:05.229
- All right, I'll check upstairs.
- Yeah.

26:08.733 --> 26:09.817
Annie?

26:09.985 --> 26:12.987
Sorry, boys. I'm leaving the pack.

26:13.154 --> 26:16.198
It's Dean. And Sam.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.706
That's not odd.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.342
Sam! Get back down here!

26:36.845 --> 26:38.387
Annie?

26:41.766 --> 26:43.851
Slimer?

26:45.520 --> 26:47.521
- What?
- Check it out.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.358
The final moments of their love story.

26:51.526 --> 26:54.069
They've been
together since like eighth grade.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.988
They entered this house and texted us.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.990
I hate these indie films.
Nothing ever happens.

26:58.158 --> 27:02.703
They came into the house.
They walked these halls...

27:02.871 --> 27:04.204
Wait, wait. Pause it.

27:04.914 --> 27:06.248
Frame back a little bit.

27:06.416 --> 27:07.750
Stop.

27:08.710 --> 27:10.502
She's here. And not in a good way.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.633
Give them a moment. They've gotten
a little slower since I left.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.092
Annie?

27:17.260 --> 27:20.387
- I gotta let them know that I'm here.
- Anything?

27:20.805 --> 27:22.890
- You have to do it. We can't.
- Annie!

27:23.099 --> 27:24.516
- Annie?
- It's too dangerous.

27:25.143 --> 27:29.229
These guys can help.
They just need to know that we're here.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.236
Whoa!

27:36.404 --> 27:40.074
- Please. I'm Victoria. Victoria Dodd.
- Where'd you come from?

27:40.617 --> 27:41.950
Here.

27:42.327 --> 27:43.535
I was a fancy lady.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.705
A hooker?

27:49.334 --> 27:50.918
Uh, is Annie here?

27:51.127 --> 27:52.836
Yes.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.340
You can't see her.

27:57.175 --> 27:59.968
- No, you're not standing on her.
- You wanna just tell them?

28:00.136 --> 28:03.889
I will. In my day,
we believed in polite conversation.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.185
Annie's in terrible danger. We all are.

28:08.395 --> 28:10.020
- From?
- Whitman Van Ness.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.440
- But he's dead.
- You said they were good.

28:13.608 --> 28:16.610
Hey, I'm just processing, okay?
He's dead, you're dead.

28:16.778 --> 28:17.903
Define "terrible danger."

28:18.071 --> 28:21.573
Whitman has great power over all of us
in the house. He killed Annie.

28:22.534 --> 28:25.119
She says you can free us.

28:25.745 --> 28:27.413
Please, you must...

28:38.216 --> 28:39.925
Victoria?

28:40.760 --> 28:44.513
I'm gonna say she was telling the truth,
considering she just got ghost-killed.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.265
So, what? Whitman Van Ness?

28:47.183 --> 28:50.853
Now we know whose bones
to salt and burn. Let's go.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.166
Aw, hell, no.

29:22.510 --> 29:26.346
If I hadn't stashed that flask here,
I'd still be glued to Sam and Dean.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.515
- Real clever.
- Actually was.

29:28.683 --> 29:32.269
Son of a bitch. I figured our one ace
was that bastard Whitman...

29:32.437 --> 29:34.146
...couldn't leave the house either.

29:34.314 --> 29:37.608
He must have pulled a number like you and
the flask, planted something on the boys.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.485
- Terrific.
- Hey, listen, sweetie.

29:39.652 --> 29:42.821
You could beat yourself up all day
about this...

29:42.989 --> 29:46.074
...or we could take advantage
of the fact that Whitman's gone...

29:46.242 --> 29:49.620
...do what we're supposed to do.
Let's go figure this out.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.415
Coming, Robert?

29:59.380 --> 30:01.423
Well, we've searched everywhere else.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.676
I'm telling you,
Whitman guards his room like Fort Knox.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.775
Last time I checked,
ghosts didn't get cold.

30:21.611 --> 30:24.196
Yeah, that's Victoria.

30:24.405 --> 30:28.575
That is how he took her out.
But where did he get her corpse?

30:28.743 --> 30:31.954
You said he dragged those two dead
kids away. Where'd he take them?

30:32.121 --> 30:34.998
I don't know.
I couldn't risk following him.

30:35.166 --> 30:38.335
What else you say this place was
other than a whorehouse?

30:38.503 --> 30:41.296
It was a lot of things.
It was a boardinghouse...

30:41.464 --> 30:44.508
...a school, a speakeasy.

30:44.801 --> 30:47.970
Yeah? Well, thing about speakeasies...

30:48.137 --> 30:50.180
...hell of a lot to hide.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.670
I still got it.

31:45.403 --> 31:49.031
Well, this pretty much tells the story,
don't it?

31:50.116 --> 31:54.745
You know, you and me,
we burned our fair share of bones...

31:54.913 --> 31:57.456
...sent a lot of ghosts packing.

31:59.375 --> 32:02.586
It's a little different
when you're on the receiving end.

32:04.714 --> 32:06.048
So, uh...

32:08.885 --> 32:10.886
...what do you think happens to them?

32:11.471 --> 32:13.472
Heaven, hell, or...

32:15.016 --> 32:17.184
...none of the above?

32:17.852 --> 32:19.895
I don't know.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.105
Just gone...

32:22.357 --> 32:24.191
...most likely.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.570
Yeah, that's what I think too.

32:29.864 --> 32:31.615
That's what I want.

32:32.075 --> 32:33.492
I want a hunter's funeral.

32:34.953 --> 32:37.704
Ah, come on, it's better than this.

32:37.872 --> 32:42.542
Stuck to this house,
somewhere between existing and not.

32:45.046 --> 32:49.800
No, I'm ready for some peace.

32:52.762 --> 32:56.098
Wasn't much of a life.
It's lonely, what we do.

32:56.349 --> 33:00.310
- Yeah, but the life I had is the one I picked.
- Yeah, but you had the boys.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.816
All I had was work. That's gone now.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.735
- Yeah, well, I ain't done.
- Okay, fine. But I am.

33:10.738 --> 33:15.409
You're stronger than I am, now, Bobby.
So, uh, you gotta do this for me.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.542
All right, here we go.
Cemetery, edge of town.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.211
The Van Ness family
has its own mausoleum.

33:26.379 --> 33:29.006
We light up the bastard
and finish him off.

33:34.053 --> 33:36.013
Take it easy. We'll get there.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.098
Uh, that's not me.

33:55.533 --> 33:57.367
Why's he with us?

33:57.535 --> 34:00.620
I don't know.
There's gotta be something on us.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.039
Hey. Hey.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.374
- Unh.
- Sam!

34:13.217 --> 34:15.469
Did that do it? That get rid of him?

34:15.636 --> 34:18.304
I got a bad idea we just snapped him
back to his favorite house.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.974
- Annie's a sitting duck.
- We gotta find those bones.

34:22.435 --> 34:27.188
Let's build up the fire. We can put some
of these poor bastards to rest, at least.

34:40.036 --> 34:42.954
Well, let's get to cremating.
We ain't got all day.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.861
Enjoy the view from my room?

35:15.404 --> 35:17.322
Planning to thin out the population?

35:18.157 --> 35:22.285
Is this how you repay my hospitality?!

35:32.755 --> 35:36.383
No! I will not be taken!

36:03.411 --> 36:04.995
How long was I out?

36:05.413 --> 36:07.164
A while.

36:07.331 --> 36:08.874
You okay?

36:09.917 --> 36:11.668
Sure.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.629
I mean...

36:15.298 --> 36:21.219
...I'm dead, I'm a ghost,
but basically swell.

36:25.308 --> 36:26.349
Hi, boys.

36:30.521 --> 36:32.147
Bobby?

36:32.315 --> 36:33.773
Wait...

36:35.109 --> 36:37.277
...you can see me?

36:43.868 --> 36:45.577
You're staring, you know.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.124
Annie's here too, by the way.

36:53.085 --> 36:54.836
- Hi, Annie.
- Hi, Annie.

36:55.004 --> 36:56.630
Hi, guys.

36:57.673 --> 37:00.884
She says you both look uglier
than she remembered.

37:04.138 --> 37:06.097
Bobby, how'd you stay here?

37:07.058 --> 37:08.308
Yeah, well, um...

37:16.859 --> 37:18.235
Suck on that, Swayze.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.948
That's why you never answered me.

37:23.115 --> 37:27.285
I tried calling you.
The Talking Board, the works.

37:27.453 --> 37:28.662
But I was always alone.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.082
Dean always had that thing in his pocket.

37:32.250 --> 37:34.292
That's why the EMF
only went off half the time.

37:34.460 --> 37:36.336
We thought we were going crazy.

37:36.504 --> 37:38.463
So, what happened?

37:38.631 --> 37:40.298
Did you get stuck or what?

37:41.300 --> 37:42.634
I wanted to stay.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.346
- Bobby.
- I need to help.

37:49.684 --> 37:52.811
Not if it means you have to be this.

37:53.479 --> 37:55.855
Life wasn't comfy, why should death be?

37:56.607 --> 37:57.941
Now, come on.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.903
Annie and I found all the bodies.
Let's put them to rest.

38:02.071 --> 38:07.033
And keep my damn flask away from the fire,
obviously.

38:11.747 --> 38:13.373
Well, are you coming?

38:24.802 --> 38:26.303
I'll miss her.

38:28.347 --> 38:30.223
- Me too. Ahem.
- Yeah.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.392
Well, you didn't know her like I did.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.692
Well, uh... Ahem.

38:42.778 --> 38:43.862
Here's to Annie.

38:44.613 --> 38:47.407
She got the hunter's funeral she wanted.

38:51.078 --> 38:53.621
Kind of like the one
we thought we gave you.

38:54.081 --> 38:55.665
Dean...

38:55.833 --> 38:57.709
What were you thinking, Bobby?

38:59.587 --> 39:03.673
You could be in heaven right now,
drinking beer at Harvelle's, not stuck...

39:03.883 --> 39:05.008
Stuck here with you?

39:06.594 --> 39:08.303
We still have work to do.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.431
I just thought
that was kind of important, Dean.

39:14.352 --> 39:16.019
It's not right. You know that.

39:17.521 --> 39:19.397
Sorry. You're right.

39:19.982 --> 39:21.649
What was I thinking?

39:36.248 --> 39:38.375
So, what do you think we should do?

39:39.960 --> 39:42.128
We did what we should do.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.588
Now I don't know.

39:47.718 --> 39:50.720
I mean, do you think it's possible
we could...

39:50.930 --> 39:53.723
...I don't know,
make it all work somehow?

39:54.683 --> 39:57.185
I have no idea. Maybe.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.812
I've never heard of it.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.233
But you know what I do know?

40:03.442 --> 40:05.318
It ain't the natural order of things.

40:06.237 --> 40:10.990
Everything is supposed to end.
You know, he was supposed...

40:14.912 --> 40:16.496
And now...

40:17.957 --> 40:20.417
What are the odds this ends well?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.129
What are the odds?
