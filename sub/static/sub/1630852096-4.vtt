WEBVTT

00:07.275 --> 00:09.343
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:09.443 --> 00:11.179
The killer is a Ni'Var citizen

00:11.279 --> 00:13.514
and a Qowat Milat nun
known as J'Vini.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.683
Starfleet remands the prisoner

00:15.783 --> 00:18.018
to your custody
for extradition to Ni'Var.

00:18.119 --> 00:19.187
BURNHAM:
First officer of the Credence.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.488
He had two kids.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.190
Then you know
they deserved justice.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.325
I also know bringing Ni'Var
into the Federation

00:24.425 --> 00:26.094
will benefit millions.

00:26.194 --> 00:27.595
There must have been a sign
it was coming.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.063
I missed it.

00:29.163 --> 00:31.999
What you require
is freedom from guilt.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.468
My mind to your mind.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.570
It can be a little hard
to get out of your comfort zone

00:36.670 --> 00:38.506
when you can barely get out
of the lab.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.308
So getting the opportunity
to do this,

00:40.408 --> 00:41.675
this could be really good
for me.

00:43.511 --> 00:44.745
ADIRA:
Are you... you?

00:44.845 --> 00:47.215
I'm definitely me.

00:47.315 --> 00:48.516
(chuckles):
How do you feel?

00:48.616 --> 00:50.651
Whole.

00:57.491 --> 01:01.562
BURNHAM:
Captain's log,
stardate 865661.2.

01:01.662 --> 01:06.066
It's been a week since
my mission with the Qowat Milat.

01:06.167 --> 01:09.036
Since then we've stayed
in orbit over Ni'Var,

01:09.137 --> 01:10.571
working with
the Ni'Var Science Institute

01:10.671 --> 01:12.140
and the Federation Task Force

01:12.240 --> 01:15.243
that's tracking and studying
the DMA.

01:15.343 --> 01:19.147
No other inhabited worlds
have been threatened yet,

01:19.247 --> 01:23.117
but of course that can change
at any moment.

01:23.217 --> 01:25.519
Ni'Var has
fast-tracked negotiations

01:25.619 --> 01:27.121
to rejoin the Federation.

01:27.221 --> 01:28.422
I haven't yet
heard how they're going.

01:28.522 --> 01:32.160
We're all living in uncertainty.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.562
Even for a crew as familiar
with the unknown as this one,

01:34.662 --> 01:37.531
the stress is taking its toll.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.601
I'm following
Dr. Culber's advice,

01:40.701 --> 01:42.403
mandating downtime to help

01:42.503 --> 01:45.439
with their psychological
and emotional well-being.

01:47.641 --> 01:51.479
But Stamets won't let himself
slow down, even for a second.

01:51.579 --> 01:55.483
He wants to solve this
for all of us, especially Book.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.751
Book.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.388
Even though the mind meld
with T'Rina helped at the time,

02:00.488 --> 02:03.224
the peace he felt has been...

02:03.324 --> 02:04.958
fleeting.

02:05.058 --> 02:07.461
I've encouraged him
to talk to Dr. Culber,

02:07.561 --> 02:10.464
but I feel him
pulling into himself.

02:10.564 --> 02:14.235
A natural response
to grief, crisis,

02:14.335 --> 02:16.170
all of this.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.439
But he can't do this alone.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.441
None of us can.

02:20.541 --> 02:23.110
SARU: Captain,
President Rillak has requested

02:23.211 --> 02:25.145
our presence on Ni'Var.

02:25.246 --> 02:27.014
For the summit
with President T'rina?

02:27.114 --> 02:28.449
Negotiations are coming
to a close.

02:28.549 --> 02:31.018
Uh, but Admiral Vance
has fallen ill

02:31.118 --> 02:33.587
with what I am told is
a Malindian stomach worm.

02:33.687 --> 02:35.523
The accepted medical guidance is

02:35.623 --> 02:38.158
to allow the worm to gestate
before extraction.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.594
-Mm. How long will that take?
-24 hours.

02:40.694 --> 02:43.597
We are to replace him
in his diplomatic capacity.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.266
I would love to be there

02:45.366 --> 02:47.067
when Ni'Var officially rejoins
the Federation,

02:47.167 --> 02:49.637
but DMA analysis
has to take priority.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.472
I'm sure she doesn't need
both of us.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.041
Well, to clarify,
President Rillak did not imply

02:54.141 --> 02:56.043
a choice in the matter.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.078
Did she brief you
on how exactly

02:58.178 --> 03:00.013
we're meant to participate?

03:00.113 --> 03:03.284
Oh, we are to, and I quote,

03:03.384 --> 03:07.555
"Remain silent and
look official, nothing more."

03:10.123 --> 03:13.026
I still feel lost.

03:13.126 --> 03:15.128
Your time with the Qowat Milat
wasn't helpful?

03:15.229 --> 03:16.497
No, it was.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.699
They have this whole
"absolute candor" thing.

03:18.799 --> 03:22.035
So I kind of tried that
on myself.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.104
And?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.040
It's...

03:27.140 --> 03:31.279
It's like, you know,
all these years,

03:31.379 --> 03:35.048
I think I have been
on the straight-line path

03:35.148 --> 03:36.584
to the captain's chair

03:36.684 --> 03:38.686
and just trying to get there
as fast as I could.

03:38.786 --> 03:42.490
But now I think maybe...

03:43.457 --> 03:46.260
Maybe you need to take a detour?

03:47.261 --> 03:48.996
(stammers) Yeah.
I have been trying

03:49.096 --> 03:50.298
to step outside
my comfort zone.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.100
I hunted down a nun.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.568
I ate foods that I hate.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.637
Have you ever tried
Rigelian rutabagas?

03:56.737 --> 04:00.240
Because they are horrible,
so don't, seriously.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.210
But these are
like little baby steps,

04:03.311 --> 04:07.080
and I feel like I really need
to challenge myself.

04:07.180 --> 04:09.249
Maybe I could volunteer
in Astrometrics,

04:09.350 --> 04:11.251
or study medicine?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.053
I don't know.
Seems to make you happy.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.455
(chuckles)

04:14.555 --> 04:15.989
It might be a good idea
to clear your mind

04:16.089 --> 04:17.325
before you make any choices.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.327
That is... that is exactly
the problem.

04:19.427 --> 04:20.994
My mind doesn't clear.
And then now

04:21.094 --> 04:22.496
with all this
DMA craziness going on,

04:22.596 --> 04:24.698
it's like...

04:25.766 --> 04:28.235
You know, Dr. Kovich came to me,

04:28.336 --> 04:30.270
looking for
a Discovery crew member

04:30.371 --> 04:32.973
to lead some cadets
in a team-building exercise.

04:33.073 --> 04:35.142
He's consulting
with Starfleet Academy.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.010
Believes we have
something special to offer

04:37.110 --> 04:39.480
since we served in a time
before the Burn.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.616
How would I justify bailing
on Commander Stamets

04:42.716 --> 04:44.418
to go lead an exercise?

04:44.518 --> 04:47.388
The captain's requiring everyone
to take some downtime.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.457
This would count as yours.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.694
Go. Get inspired.

04:56.397 --> 04:58.165
Okay.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.334
Mm, here's hoping.

05:01.335 --> 05:02.503
You know,
come to think of it,

05:02.603 --> 05:04.271
can you do me a favor
when you go?

05:04.372 --> 05:07.675
Why is Tilly ordering me to go
on a training exercise

05:07.775 --> 05:09.176
for cadets?

05:09.276 --> 05:10.444
I'm already an ensign.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.446
Starfleet Academy is awesome.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.047
(chuckles)

05:14.147 --> 05:15.349
Try and think of it

05:15.449 --> 05:17.651
as part of your responsibility
as host.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.454
Your supposed to add new
experiences to your symbiont.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.624
Yeah, but Jovar taught
at the Academy before the Burn.

05:23.724 --> 05:26.994
So, really, Tal's already got
that experience.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.162
GRAY:
There's always
something new to learn.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.264
And besides,
orders are orders.

05:31.365 --> 05:33.567
All right. Well,
what are you gonna do today?

05:33.667 --> 05:36.236
You know, other than
the zhian'tal exercises.

05:36.336 --> 05:39.373
Mind and body connection is
everything,

05:39.473 --> 05:41.274
especially when you have
a new body.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.677
But then I really want
to check out

05:43.777 --> 05:46.580
the crew games they're planning
in the forward lounge.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.549
You barely know anyone.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.418
I'll walk in, say hello.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.986
Now I know someone. Easy.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.254
You'll do the same
with the cadets.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.356
I'm sorry, have you met me?

05:56.457 --> 05:59.359
(chuckles):
Can't have soup
without scanning it first.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.261
(chuckles softly)

06:01.361 --> 06:05.198
I don't really know
how to do new without you.

06:05.298 --> 06:07.701
So, this is
your chance to learn.

06:11.138 --> 06:12.940
Okay. I'm going.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.241
Or tomorrow, maybe?

06:14.341 --> 06:16.510
Tomorrow, I think-- (laughs)

06:19.680 --> 06:21.515
MAN (over P.A.):
Discovery shuttle,

06:21.615 --> 06:24.051
you are cleared for landing.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.395
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

06:39.232 --> 06:41.201
Ah, Kovich, to the right.

06:43.170 --> 06:46.006
Lieutenant Tilly. Ensign Tal.

06:46.106 --> 06:48.141
Welcome back
to Starfleet Academy.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.644
Thank you, sir.
It's an absolute honor, uh...

06:50.744 --> 06:53.647
Honestly, never thought I'd be
asked to do anything like this.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.416
I was, I was the kid in class
who was asked to stop talking.

06:56.517 --> 06:59.019
Front row, hand up,
that's me.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.053
KOVICH:
Ensign Tal.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.456
You'll be on shuttlecraft 11.

07:02.556 --> 07:05.192
The other cadets are
waiting there.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.027
Why don't you
introduce yourself?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.630
Y-Yes, sir. Sounds good.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.164
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Cadet Cho, report...

07:11.264 --> 07:13.133
Thank you for letting me
bring Adira along.

07:13.233 --> 07:16.169
Uh, Dr. Culber thought
it could be beneficial.

07:16.269 --> 07:19.006
They could use a little work
in the team-building department.

07:19.106 --> 07:23.010
It's a problem we're seeing with
all of our Starfleet cadets.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.145
That's why I'm consulting.

07:25.245 --> 07:27.447
They may be the best
their worlds have to offer,

07:27.548 --> 07:31.084
but they grew up isolated
and disconnected.

07:31.184 --> 07:34.054
Many of them find it hard
to function as a team

07:34.154 --> 07:36.724
with individuals
they don't already know,

07:36.824 --> 07:40.160
especially those of species
they've never encountered.

07:40.260 --> 07:42.530
But with the DMA...

07:42.630 --> 07:44.732
Starfleet needs personnel
now more than ever,

07:44.832 --> 07:46.734
but if people can't even
work together...

07:46.834 --> 07:48.201
Precisely.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.638
One might say
that today's exercise is

07:50.738 --> 07:53.440
about the very future
of Starfleet.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.709
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Starfleet cadets...

07:55.809 --> 07:57.678
You'll do great, Lieutenant.

07:59.246 --> 08:00.514
TILLY:
Today's exercise will be

08:00.614 --> 08:03.216
a typical survey mission.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.285
Lieutenant Callum will be
taking us to Geryon,

08:05.385 --> 08:09.389
which is an M-class desert moon
orbiting Theta Helios.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.526
Uh, once there, we will carry
out a full planetary analysis.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.294
Yes!

08:14.394 --> 08:15.629
(chuckles):
So fun.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.430
I think it's fun.

08:17.531 --> 08:19.266
I mean, it's new worlds,
new things.

08:19.366 --> 08:23.303
Like, "Hey, what's that?
Is that a new life-form? What?"

08:24.572 --> 08:26.339
Amazing.

08:29.610 --> 08:33.213
So, okay, o-once we arrive,
we'll have six hours,

08:33.313 --> 08:34.948
uh, at which point
we'll need to rendezvous

08:35.048 --> 08:36.516
with the USS Armstrong,

08:36.617 --> 08:39.519
uh, before heading back
to Federation Headquarters.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.957
So, you guys have been
at the Academy

08:44.057 --> 08:45.325
for a couple months now.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.426
You probably know each other
pretty well

08:46.526 --> 08:47.595
at this point, huh?

08:47.695 --> 08:49.296
Um, not really.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.531
Academics keep us pretty busy.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.500
TILLY:
Well, this is
a team-building exercise,

08:53.601 --> 08:56.503
so, um... I'll start.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.707
Hello,
I am Lieutenant Sylvia Tilly.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.241
I was born on Earth.

09:01.341 --> 09:03.343
I do remember
my first training exercise.

09:03.443 --> 09:07.447
Um, I dropped my utility kit
down a methane gas vent.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.949
(Tilly chuckles)

09:10.150 --> 09:11.284
Who's next?

09:11.384 --> 09:13.086
Anyone else?

09:15.756 --> 09:18.425
We'll be dropping out of warp
in one minute.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.227
In that case,

09:20.327 --> 09:22.162
I should probably just give
you guys your assignments.

09:22.262 --> 09:25.132
Okay, Ensign Tal,
Magnetospheric.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.935
Cadet Harral, Geological.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.970
Cadet Sasha, Microbial.

09:30.070 --> 09:33.240
And Cadet Gorev, Atmospheric.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.943
Um, I sort of thought
that you'd be

09:36.043 --> 09:37.177
bringing me as your aide.

09:37.277 --> 09:38.946
You know, to keep an eye
on the students,

09:39.046 --> 09:41.615
make sure they don't drop
anything down a methane vent.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.217
Yeah, I think, actually, for
this exercise, it's more useful

09:44.317 --> 09:46.153
for you to think of yourself
as another cadet.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.621
You still have a lot to learn.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.723
-(rumbling)
-(alarm blaring)

09:49.823 --> 09:52.459
-What's happening?
-We've been hit by
a rogue gamma-ray burst.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.662
Engines are off-line.
Helm's not responding.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.263
Everybody, hold on to something.

09:56.363 --> 09:57.631
I'm a trained pilot.
I can help.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.366
No, Sasha, sit down.
That's an order.

09:59.466 --> 10:02.102
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Protective shielding deployed.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.470
TILLY:
Can you get auxiliary
systems working?

10:03.570 --> 10:05.338
Negative. We're going down.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.374
-Brace for impact! Brace!
-(loud rattling)

10:13.213 --> 10:15.248
*

10:42.676 --> 10:45.545
*

11:12.773 --> 11:15.608
*

11:29.622 --> 11:32.625
(original Star Trek theme
plays)

11:43.236 --> 11:45.472
-(alarms blaring)
-(coughing)

11:47.207 --> 11:48.675
TILLY:
Everyone okay?

11:48.776 --> 11:51.244
(groaning)

11:51.344 --> 11:52.813
CALLUM:
Help me.

11:56.817 --> 12:00.320
-Oh. No, no, no, no, no.
-(groans)

12:00.420 --> 12:02.655
(shushes) No, no, no, no, no.
Don't move, don't move, don't.

12:02.756 --> 12:04.524
Okay, I-I'm gonna cut away
the uniform,

12:04.624 --> 12:06.960
gain access to the wound.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.195
It's gonna be okay.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.729
Uh, this-this wraps around

12:09.830 --> 12:11.064
and then we suture it
until we can get some help.

12:11.164 --> 12:12.699
Here.

12:13.801 --> 12:15.568
(gasps)

12:16.369 --> 12:18.238
(alarms continue blaring)

12:18.338 --> 12:19.606
HARRAL:
Is he gonna make it?

12:19.706 --> 12:22.009
TILLY:
No.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.448
(gasping softly)

12:31.584 --> 12:34.487
USS Armstrong. Come in.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.690
Armstrong, this is Starfleet
Lieutenant Sylvia Tilly.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.693
We are on a training mission.
Acknowledge.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.396
I think the gamma-ray burst
would've knocked out the comms.

12:44.531 --> 12:45.432
(electrical whirring)

12:45.532 --> 12:47.400
Let's see where we are.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.545
Shouldn't this be a desert moon?

12:58.645 --> 13:01.448
We were headed for Geryon,
M-class moon.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.483
This is...

13:03.583 --> 13:06.586
This is Kokytos, L-class moon.

13:06.686 --> 13:08.555
We landed on the wrong moon?

13:08.655 --> 13:13.193
L-class is breathable
but environmentally hostile.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.496
Okay, come on. This is
obviously part of the exercise.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.734
We're in a holo simulation,
right?

13:21.835 --> 13:23.670
No.

13:23.770 --> 13:25.605
I'm sorry.
I wish I could say yes.

13:25.705 --> 13:27.674
This is real. This is happening.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.979
The emergency distress beacon,

13:32.079 --> 13:33.413
that would've activated
upon impact.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.248
Right? So, um, Gorev.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.683
You check life support systems
for me.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.751
Sasha, you said you're a pilot,
right?

13:38.852 --> 13:40.720
See if you can get some
flight systems back on line.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.255
Harral, you're with me.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.290
We're gonna get
long-range comms back on.

13:43.390 --> 13:44.657
I'll try to get sensors working.

13:44.757 --> 13:46.693
Good, thank you.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.429
-(grunts)
-Hey, watch it.

13:49.529 --> 13:50.763
-You see me working here.
-ADIRA: Hey.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.066
Hey, this is not the time.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.035
-Stay out of it.
-Hey, hey. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.236
No, no, no, no.
We're not doing this. No.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.704
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Calm down.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.606
It is gonna be okay. Okay?

13:59.706 --> 14:01.041
Once we get systems
back on line,

14:01.141 --> 14:03.110
we will call the Armstrong.

14:03.210 --> 14:06.013
-They'll pick us up.
-They're not expecting us
for six hours.

14:06.113 --> 14:07.614
A lot can happen in six hours.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.682
Okay, uh, you know what?
I know you guys weren't into

14:09.782 --> 14:11.251
the whole introductions thing
before,

14:11.351 --> 14:13.053
but we are doing it,
now, while we work.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.421
Got it?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.123
Harral, on comms, now.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.158
Adira.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.560
Adira, you go first.
Uh, tell us about yourself.

14:20.660 --> 14:24.164
Um, I'm... I'm Adira Tal.

14:24.264 --> 14:27.034
I grew up on a generation ship,

14:27.134 --> 14:30.370
and now I am an ensign
on Discovery.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.639
Great. Sasha, you next.
Go ahead.

14:32.739 --> 14:34.441
Val Sasha.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.010
Grew up in a colony on Titan.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.412
Learned to pilot when I was 12.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.648
And coming to the Academy was

14:41.748 --> 14:47.254
the first time I'd met
any nonhumans before.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.258
Gorev.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.160
Taahz Gorev.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.062
After the Burn,

14:55.162 --> 14:57.430
my family was stranded
in Emerald Chain territory.

14:57.530 --> 15:00.033
We weren't treated very well.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.203
HARRAL:
Harral.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.372
Orion.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.108
Which means I have to work twice
as hard to be taken seriously.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.642
(growls)

15:09.742 --> 15:12.645
If you check my file,
you'll see I'm top of the class.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.648
Right. Good.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.650
Now we all know each other
a little better.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.987
-(claps)
-Go team.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.122
*

15:29.629 --> 15:31.664
(indistinct chatter)

15:42.775 --> 15:44.344
AIDE:
Sir?

15:56.556 --> 15:59.192
It appears you have a fan, Saru.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.293
(clears throat)

16:00.393 --> 16:03.463
RILLAK:
Friends, colleagues.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.932
The last four months have seen

16:06.033 --> 16:08.301
a series of summits
such as this,

16:08.401 --> 16:10.237
and it is
my great privilege to say

16:10.337 --> 16:14.707
that we have now come to the end
of this historic process.

16:14.807 --> 16:18.645
The Federation has reviewed the
final points of the Agreement.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.580
We are fully satisfied

16:20.680 --> 16:24.651
and prepared to welcome Ni'Var
back into the Federation.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.024
President Rillak,

16:31.124 --> 16:35.595
we, too, are glad to be nearing
the restoration of our alliance.

16:35.695 --> 16:39.166
However, there is one final
matter we must discuss.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.568
The reality of
the gravitational anomaly,

16:41.668 --> 16:43.703
and the threat it poses
to our galaxy,

16:43.803 --> 16:46.406
has shifted many things
recently.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.674
For all of us.

16:49.209 --> 16:51.644
I am aware that this will
come as a surprise.

16:51.744 --> 16:55.615
However, we will require
an amendment to the Agreement,

16:55.715 --> 16:58.585
allowing for Ni'Var's immediate
and unconditional withdrawal

16:58.685 --> 17:01.321
from the Federation
should the need arise.

17:01.421 --> 17:05.125
(murmuring)

17:06.626 --> 17:09.096
An exit clause?

17:09.196 --> 17:12.665
I'm sure you are also aware,
this is unprecedented.

17:12.765 --> 17:16.269
Madam President, I must
remind you that before the Burn,

17:16.369 --> 17:18.471
Ni'Var and other worlds

17:18.571 --> 17:22.041
felt the Federation had grown
so disconnected from its members

17:22.142 --> 17:25.044
that it was unable to consider
their individual needs.

17:25.145 --> 17:27.414
Trust was eroded.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.516
The repercussions are
still being felt.

17:29.616 --> 17:32.252
We cannot accept a rejoining

17:32.352 --> 17:34.020
without measures in place
that protect us

17:34.121 --> 17:36.589
from such a situation
arising again.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.726
This is a different time,
Madam President.

17:39.826 --> 17:43.696
Be that as it may,
we stand firm.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.599
RILLAK:
The Federation would never
force any world

17:46.699 --> 17:48.335
to remain a member.

17:48.435 --> 17:50.403
Ni'Var is proof of that.

17:53.440 --> 17:57.710
However, unconditional
withdrawal is not acceptable.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.147
That would give Ni'Var
all the benefits of membership

18:00.247 --> 18:01.981
while the Federation would bear

18:02.081 --> 18:04.384
all of the risks associated
with its exit.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.120
Furthermore, such a precedent
would allow other worlds

18:07.220 --> 18:09.189
to request similar clauses.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.124
A weaker Federation
would result.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.626
T'RINA:
It is illogical to rejoin
an organization

18:13.726 --> 18:16.263
that seeks to impose conditions
on our judgment.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.598
Perhaps we have moved
too quickly in these talks.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.468
-If I may.
-(murmuring)

18:22.502 --> 18:23.970
(murmuring stops)

18:25.205 --> 18:29.509
With the tremendous strides made
to reach this point,

18:29.609 --> 18:32.145
it's illogical to forfeit
over one issue.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.214
Ni'Var has endured
without the Federation

18:34.314 --> 18:36.048
for a century.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.584
We will continue to do so.

18:37.684 --> 18:38.985
BURNHAM:
Madam President.

18:40.119 --> 18:44.157
There is a difference
between enduring and thriving.

18:50.129 --> 18:52.965
President T'Rina,

18:53.065 --> 18:54.667
may I propose a recess?

18:54.767 --> 18:56.469
Very well.

18:56.569 --> 18:59.172
(murmuring)

18:59.272 --> 19:01.274
The objections President T'Rina
raised have existed

19:01.374 --> 19:03.009
for over a hundred years.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.977
It's not just the DMA,
something else is going on.

19:05.077 --> 19:07.146
Talk to her and
see if you can find out what.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.549
Politics are not our place.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.551
Join me, Captain.

19:11.651 --> 19:14.621
CULBER:
I know this was Michael's idea.

19:14.721 --> 19:17.056
How do you feel about that?

19:17.156 --> 19:19.359
The mind meld helped.

19:19.459 --> 19:20.660
I'm fine.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.595
She says you're
still not sleeping.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.297
Perhaps we could
talk about that?

19:24.397 --> 19:27.166
It's Grudge. Yeah.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.702
She's been
especially needy lately.

19:29.802 --> 19:32.004
Oh, it's a rough life.

19:32.104 --> 19:33.973
(chuckles softly)

19:34.073 --> 19:38.110
You ever been to
a standing funeral?

19:38.211 --> 19:40.413
El muerto parado.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.114
No?

19:42.215 --> 19:44.251
It's an, uh...

19:44.351 --> 19:47.620
an uncommon Earth tradition,
but one my family practiced.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.990
When a family member dies,
their body is embalmed

19:51.090 --> 19:54.427
and then posed in a position
that best evokes their life.

19:54.527 --> 19:59.031
My, um, tío Cesar was
this infamous card shark.

19:59.131 --> 20:01.601
And so, my family wanted to
place him at a poker table.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.370
And it was all going fine,

20:03.470 --> 20:06.038
till my cousins and I
snapped off his thumb

20:06.138 --> 20:07.740
trying to place the cards
in his hand.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.410
What did you do?

20:10.510 --> 20:13.513
I used all my medical training,
and I reattached it.

20:13.613 --> 20:16.215
And then broke off
his index finger. (laughs)

20:16.316 --> 20:19.752
We couldn't stop laughing,
that whole funeral long.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.388
(chuckles)

20:21.488 --> 20:23.022
I didn't expect that.

20:23.122 --> 20:26.559
Well, in conventional therapy,

20:26.659 --> 20:29.028
I'm not supposed to share
personal things, but...

20:29.128 --> 20:32.031
as crewmates, we already know
too much about each other, so...

20:32.131 --> 20:33.633
Sometimes the personal helps.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.270
Look, I get it.
Grief is complicated.

20:37.370 --> 20:39.005
It takes many forms.

20:39.105 --> 20:41.508
I need to let myself
experience it

20:41.608 --> 20:43.710
however it comes, right?

20:44.844 --> 20:47.246
I was devastated
when my tío died.

20:47.347 --> 20:49.248
I was so angry,

20:49.349 --> 20:52.018
and I went to
that funeral determined

20:52.118 --> 20:54.487
that nothing was gonna
make me feel better.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.391
If you're willing, I'd like to
try something different

20:58.491 --> 21:00.393
with our remaining time.

21:00.493 --> 21:03.095
As long as I can keep
my fingers.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.131
Mm.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.733
(chuckles softly)

21:06.833 --> 21:08.335
SARU:
President T'Rina.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.737
Thank you for
the traditional Kelpien tea.

21:10.837 --> 21:13.306
I thought you might enjoy
a taste of home.

21:13.406 --> 21:17.009
I am dismayed the situation is
so difficult.

21:17.109 --> 21:20.146
If I can be of assistance,
you need only ask.

21:20.246 --> 21:22.749
Many would be happy
to see Ni'Var

21:22.849 --> 21:24.484
and the Federation rejoined,

21:24.584 --> 21:26.586
myself included.

21:26.686 --> 21:30.056
I, too, share this sentiment.

21:30.156 --> 21:31.458
But I am bound
first and foremost

21:31.558 --> 21:33.726
by obligations to my own people.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.562
There is nothing more I can do

21:35.662 --> 21:38.565
if the Federation is
unwilling to compromise.

21:40.533 --> 21:42.168
Of course.

21:42.268 --> 21:44.537
I understand.

21:45.672 --> 21:48.007
Now, if you will excuse me,

21:48.107 --> 21:50.410
I intend to use the remaining
recess for meditation.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.721
RILLAK:
These are delicate matters.

22:01.821 --> 22:05.392
President T'Rina and I are
not just representing ourselves

22:05.492 --> 22:08.361
but also a whole host
of other interests.

22:08.461 --> 22:10.730
There must be
a way to compromise.

22:12.532 --> 22:16.035
All eyes are on us, Captain.

22:16.135 --> 22:19.372
Were I to offer a compromise,
it would project weakness.

22:19.472 --> 22:21.207
Listen to me well.

22:21.307 --> 22:23.342
My hands are tied.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.245
With no other options,

22:26.345 --> 22:30.016
it would seem that
we are done here.

22:35.455 --> 22:37.457
*

22:42.361 --> 22:43.563
I think President Rillak
wants us

22:43.663 --> 22:45.765
to find a solution
to this mess.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.735
I felt something similar
from President T'Rina.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.671
This summit has become
political theater,

22:51.771 --> 22:52.672
I'm sure of it.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.206
That must be why she found

22:54.306 --> 22:55.675
a way for us to be here today,

22:55.775 --> 22:57.677
to cut through that.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.613
Then you do not believe that
Admiral Vance fell ill?

23:00.713 --> 23:02.248
Do you?

23:03.450 --> 23:05.652
Why us?

23:05.752 --> 23:08.488
That's what we have to
figure out.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.023
TILLY:
Okay, where are we at?

23:11.123 --> 23:13.626
I've managed to stabilize
life support at 70%.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.394
All flight systems are fried.

23:15.495 --> 23:18.064
-We can't fly.
-Well, uh, what about comms?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.732
Checked every channel,
every frequency.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.168
-Nothing.
-Yeah, well,
just keep trying, then.

23:22.268 --> 23:24.270
Theta Helios has 46 moons.
Without comms,

23:24.370 --> 23:26.005
how's anyone supposed to find
a 12-meter shuttle?

23:26.105 --> 23:28.140
And we only have three days
of emergency rations.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.009
Okay. Freaking out won't help.

23:30.109 --> 23:32.044
Okay? I've lived enough lives
to know this could be worse,

23:32.144 --> 23:34.380
-so, let...
-Thanks, Admiral.
I feel so much better now.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.549
Okay, Ensign,
how are the sensors coming?

23:36.649 --> 23:38.451
-(electrical whirring)
-They're back on line,

23:38.551 --> 23:41.053
but I'm getting
some weird readings.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.122
The proximity scans show
there are thousands

23:43.222 --> 23:44.423
of life-forms just outside.

23:44.524 --> 23:47.259
And they seem to be gathering.

23:47.359 --> 23:50.229
(rumbling and rattling)

23:53.232 --> 23:54.701
(all grunt)

23:55.735 --> 23:58.771
What the hell is that?

24:01.641 --> 24:04.511
-(rumbling)
-(growling)

24:04.611 --> 24:06.579
(gasps, screams)

24:07.547 --> 24:10.116
Whatever it is,

24:10.216 --> 24:12.184
it's not good.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.426
Somebody get a tricorder out.
What are we looking at?

24:20.527 --> 24:22.562
Uh, it's a Tuscadian Pyrosome.

24:22.662 --> 24:24.396
It's a, it's a colony species
made up

24:24.497 --> 24:26.398
of thousands of
interconnected zooid life-forms.

24:26.499 --> 24:30.537
It primarily preys on, uh,
bioluminescent crustaceans,

24:30.637 --> 24:33.606
uh, tracking them
via electromagnetic signatures.

24:33.706 --> 24:35.975
That's the same signature used
by our equipment.

24:36.075 --> 24:38.144
-(growls)
-(yelps)

24:39.111 --> 24:40.980
No, no, no. Put it down.

24:41.080 --> 24:43.616
Shut down your gear.
Turn off all the equipment.

24:43.716 --> 24:46.118
-It can't see us
with our equipment off.
-(whirring)

24:46.218 --> 24:49.421
-(rumbling)
-(growling)

24:52.759 --> 24:54.527
(growling in distance)

24:54.627 --> 24:57.196
(breathing shakily)

24:58.197 --> 24:59.666
Did it go away?

24:59.766 --> 25:02.268
If it did, it'll be back.

25:02.368 --> 25:03.636
What do we do now?

25:03.736 --> 25:06.005
ADIRA:
We can't use comms.

25:06.105 --> 25:09.008
We will freeze before anyone
figures out what's happened.

25:11.744 --> 25:16.182
Okay. We got to get out
of this valley.

25:17.584 --> 25:20.119
There is a ridge up there.

25:20.219 --> 25:22.254
If we can get up there,

25:22.354 --> 25:24.023
we can catch a signal
and use our personal comms

25:24.123 --> 25:25.357
to contact the Armstrong.

25:25.457 --> 25:26.693
And we'll have a vantage point,

25:26.793 --> 25:27.960
if we need to see
the jellyfish from hell

25:28.060 --> 25:29.395
before it gets to us.

25:29.495 --> 25:32.098
-You want us to go
across all that?
-Yeah.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.301
They're not ready for this.

25:35.401 --> 25:36.302
I'll go alone.

25:36.402 --> 25:37.536
I-I can move fast,

25:37.637 --> 25:39.171
and I will work better
on my own.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.107
No. I can do it.
I have survival training.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.309
No, you're both crazy.
We should stay put.

25:43.409 --> 25:44.677
Let them risk their lives
if they want.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.779
No one is going anywhere alone.

25:48.214 --> 25:52.084
Whatever we do, from now on,
we are doing it together.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.520
Let's move.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.595
Damn it.
Doesn't look like anything yet.

26:05.397 --> 26:06.498
(sighs)

26:07.634 --> 26:09.201
This is a waste of time.

26:09.301 --> 26:11.070
Take a breath.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.371
Try again.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.173
You think I don't know
what this is?

26:14.273 --> 26:15.474
-What is it?
-A sad attempt to try

26:15.574 --> 26:17.109
and replicate
Kwei'tholum'Kwei.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.678
Kwei'tholum'Kwei?

26:18.778 --> 26:21.047
The Kwejian healing ritual.
This is nothing like it.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.214
How is it different?

26:22.314 --> 26:24.450
We're healed by our planet.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.452
For Kwei'tholum'Kwei,
you need sand

26:26.552 --> 26:28.387
from the bed of
the Mameckx'sha River.

26:28.487 --> 26:31.357
You need to ask the Tulí Forests
for their blessings.

26:31.457 --> 26:35.995
You need the Great Storms
of Naillem'kwai to make...

26:40.833 --> 26:45.104
That is programable matter
made to look like sand,

26:45.204 --> 26:46.505
because you're nothing
but cheap tricks that you got

26:46.605 --> 26:47.774
from reading a damn holoPADD.

26:50.509 --> 26:52.611
You think you've substituted
my home

26:52.712 --> 26:54.480
with this rubbish?

26:54.580 --> 26:57.984
It'll never be the same.
It'll never work.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.386
It won't be the same.

27:00.486 --> 27:02.454
Of course not.

27:02.554 --> 27:05.124
Kwejian was...

27:05.224 --> 27:08.394
one of the most beautiful places
in the known galaxy.

27:08.494 --> 27:12.231
Its loss is devastating.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.166
Profound.

27:14.266 --> 27:17.203
And you won't heal
the way you would've before.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.438
You will never feel

27:19.538 --> 27:23.409
the relief of Kwei'tholum'Kwei
again.

27:24.410 --> 27:26.979
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.548
(chuckles)

27:32.118 --> 27:34.987
How long am I supposed to do it?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.089
A long-ass time.

27:38.057 --> 27:39.558
(chuckles)

27:45.732 --> 27:47.633
(door chimes)

27:47.734 --> 27:49.101
Enter.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.676
Thank you for seeing me.

27:57.777 --> 28:01.047
Of course, but I must ask,

28:01.147 --> 28:02.548
have you come as a friend

28:02.648 --> 28:05.151
or a representative
of the Federation?

28:05.251 --> 28:07.920
No, I am here
of my own volition,

28:08.020 --> 28:11.323
while Captain Burnham seeks
audience with President Rillak.

28:12.624 --> 28:15.327
We believe she will reconsider
her position.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.935
I have been meditating
on a question:

28:23.035 --> 28:25.972
Is trust of another's commitment

28:26.072 --> 28:30.376
to a shared goal enough,
despite the scars of history?

28:32.044 --> 28:35.614
Trust is a journey.

28:37.316 --> 28:41.653
The anomaly has ignited old
and new fears alike.

28:41.754 --> 28:45.557
Some have responded with
a turn toward isolationism,

28:45.657 --> 28:48.527
including the Vulcan Purists.

28:48.627 --> 28:52.031
In return for their support,
which is vital to my coalition,

28:52.131 --> 28:54.500
they have demanded
a logical framework

28:54.600 --> 28:57.536
to hold the Federation
accountable.

28:57.636 --> 29:01.073
This exit clause provides it.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.243
Oh.

29:07.513 --> 29:10.349
Thank you for trusting me.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.153
I will leave you
to your thoughts.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.255
But...

29:16.355 --> 29:18.490
if you'll permit me,
another time,

29:18.590 --> 29:21.493
I would like to learn more
about your meditative technique.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.330
May I ask why?

29:24.430 --> 29:29.401
You weigh questions of politics.

29:29.501 --> 29:33.139
I weigh questions of place,

29:33.239 --> 29:35.107
purpose.

29:35.207 --> 29:38.644
In such uncertainly
as we are all experiencing,

29:38.744 --> 29:42.081
I'm finding it
much more challenging

29:42.181 --> 29:44.016
than I had anticipated.

29:47.553 --> 29:51.490
Place your hands out,
palms up.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.493
*

30:00.766 --> 30:04.270
It is called
a thresh-tor kashek.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.305
It means "shared mind."

30:06.405 --> 30:08.107
The type of meditation
we teach our children

30:08.207 --> 30:09.675
while they are learning.

30:09.775 --> 30:11.777
Close your eyes.

30:13.345 --> 30:16.182
*

30:20.486 --> 30:23.255
Your eyes are meant
to remain closed,

30:23.355 --> 30:25.524
Captain Saru.

30:27.226 --> 30:28.995
Take a deep breath.

30:29.095 --> 30:31.130
(takes deep breath)

30:37.503 --> 30:40.372
Lieutenant Christopher, connect
me with the president, please.

30:40.472 --> 30:42.408
(over comm):
Aye, Captain. One moment.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.545
What is it, Captain?

30:46.645 --> 30:48.414
-We're preparing to leave orbit.
-Then I'll be direct.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.349
Mr. Saru is working
to get President T'Rina

30:50.449 --> 30:51.450
back to the table.

30:51.550 --> 30:53.019
When she returns,

30:53.119 --> 30:54.486
we have to be prepared
with a compromise.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.524
Well, I have a proposal.

30:58.624 --> 31:00.026
What could you suggest

31:00.126 --> 31:01.360
that we haven't
already considered?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.295
We've been at this
for four months.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.097
At the end of the day,

31:05.197 --> 31:08.400
we both know that
politics comes down to votes,

31:08.500 --> 31:11.070
which is why you and President
T'Rina are taking positions

31:11.170 --> 31:14.040
that have been agreed upon
by your respective delegations.

31:14.140 --> 31:16.108
Neither of you can budge
from those positions

31:16.208 --> 31:18.410
or you'll lose
the support you need.

31:18.510 --> 31:22.681
But if a third party presents
a compromise,

31:22.781 --> 31:25.084
now you are not budging.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.186
Now you're just listening.

31:29.355 --> 31:32.658
All right, Captain.
What have you got?

31:34.193 --> 31:36.228
(wind howling)

31:42.701 --> 31:45.071
Keep an eye out
for the pyrosome.

31:46.638 --> 31:48.274
(crackling)

31:50.242 --> 31:52.311
Okay. What the hell was that?

31:52.411 --> 31:53.545
Spider lightning.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.347
It's a lightning
that travels kilometers.

31:55.447 --> 31:57.383
We don't want to be anywhere
near that when it strikes.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.218
You've seen this before?

31:59.318 --> 32:02.054
No, but Kasha Tal did and
barely lived to talk about it.

32:02.154 --> 32:04.723
(growling in distance)

32:06.392 --> 32:08.660
I see it! The creature,
coming right beh...

32:11.597 --> 32:13.665
HARRAL:
What the hell?

32:13.765 --> 32:16.002
(screeching, snarling)

32:19.071 --> 32:20.706
Damn thing's hunting us.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.541
It can't see us
with our equipment off.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.344
But we got to keep moving
to stay ahead of this storm.

32:25.444 --> 32:27.146
-(crackling)
-(rumbling)

32:27.246 --> 32:28.714
GOREV:
But the lightning's
rolling in too fast.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.216
-We won't make it to the ridge.
-If we pick up the pace,

32:30.316 --> 32:32.018
we can get there
ahead of the lightning.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.120
-Stop acting like you are
the expert.
-Calm down.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.188
You don't know any more about
this moon than the rest of us.

32:36.288 --> 32:37.756
We're too exposed out here.

32:37.856 --> 32:40.459
We need to find a cave
and, uh, ride out the storm.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.194
Oh, there's a genius idea.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.063
Let's trap ourselves in a cave,
make it easier

32:44.163 --> 32:45.497
for the monster to corner us.

32:45.597 --> 32:47.133
We don't have time
to stand around and argue.

32:47.233 --> 32:49.235
-All right? I'm going.
-This is ridiculous.

32:49.335 --> 32:50.502
-If they're going,
I'm going, too.
-What about sticking together?

32:50.602 --> 32:52.271
Adira, stop. Stop it!
All of you.

32:52.371 --> 32:54.573
Listen, you know, I'm usually
a very upbeat person,

32:54.673 --> 32:57.309
bubbly, some would say.

32:57.409 --> 33:00.012
But right now I have one job:
it's keeping all of you alive.

33:00.112 --> 33:02.181
-So we're staying together.
-(crackling)

33:03.082 --> 33:04.116
Adira!

33:10.689 --> 33:12.124
I can't move.

33:19.065 --> 33:20.732
ADIRA:
I'm stuck!

33:22.501 --> 33:24.570
-I can't get out.
-Stay still, you're okay.

33:24.670 --> 33:25.604
You're okay.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.739
(screeching)

33:30.076 --> 33:31.543
We have to do something
before that gets here.

33:31.643 --> 33:33.212
Uh, okay, okay.

33:35.581 --> 33:38.450
Give me the emergency kit.
Now! Come on.

33:45.791 --> 33:48.994
Here, Adira, grab it.
You got it.

33:49.095 --> 33:50.496
Okay, everybody grab a piece.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.531
Sasha, you grab them.
You got it?

33:52.631 --> 33:54.566
One, two, three, pull!

33:54.666 --> 33:57.169
-(all grunting)
-Pull!

33:57.269 --> 34:00.005
-Pull!
-Almost.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.175
Keep going. Heave!

34:03.275 --> 34:05.244
Pull!

34:05.344 --> 34:08.180
-Keep going! Come on.
-SASHA: It's working.
Don't let go!

34:08.280 --> 34:10.749
-We got you.
-Keep going. Almost there.

34:11.750 --> 34:13.985
-Almost.
-Almost there.

34:14.086 --> 34:15.421
Keep going. Closer! Almost!

34:15.521 --> 34:18.990
Keep going.
Keep going, keep going!

34:19.558 --> 34:22.328
-Got you!
-(all grunting)

34:22.428 --> 34:25.297
You... you good?

34:25.397 --> 34:28.334
You good? Okay?

34:28.434 --> 34:30.636
Okay, good, we got this.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.638
The ridge is right there.
We can make it.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.073
Once we turn the comms on,
that thing will sense us.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.442
Listen, we can do this.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.643
We just have to work together
as a team.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.611
The same way we just did
for Adira.

34:39.711 --> 34:41.147
Sure as hell would be easier

34:41.247 --> 34:42.281
if we didn't
have to count on an Orion.

34:42.381 --> 34:44.216
-Hey.
-I'm just saying,

34:44.316 --> 34:46.118
he wanted to hide
in a cave.

34:46.218 --> 34:48.086
-That's what
we're trained to do.
-Just admit it.

34:48.187 --> 34:50.322
-We seek shelter.
-You only look out
for yourself.

34:50.422 --> 34:53.058
Hey, enough! Enough.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.460
The Burn is in the past,
all right?

34:54.560 --> 34:56.027
You got to decide now--

34:56.128 --> 34:57.663
are we gonna work together
as a crew or not?

34:57.763 --> 35:01.367
When I was ten,
an Emerald Chain raiding party

35:01.467 --> 35:03.502
commandeered my family's
food replicators

35:03.602 --> 35:05.070
because they could.

35:05.171 --> 35:08.274
I watched my grandmother
starve to death.

35:08.374 --> 35:12.043
I had to bury the body because
my parents were too weak

35:12.144 --> 35:13.712
from giving me their food.

35:14.746 --> 35:17.616
Now you expect me
to work with him?

35:19.251 --> 35:21.620
I hear you.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.189
Have you ever asked him about

35:23.289 --> 35:24.590
his history with the Chain?

35:26.158 --> 35:27.626
Tell him.

35:29.661 --> 35:31.430
There is common ground here,

35:31.530 --> 35:34.566
but you'll never find it
unless you talk to each other.

35:34.666 --> 35:37.736
Uh, his father
was Bashorat Harral.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.239
What?

35:41.507 --> 35:43.309
Wh-Who's that?

35:43.409 --> 35:46.712
Uh, he was an activist.

35:46.812 --> 35:49.215
He drafted the Emancipation Bill
for the enslaved,

35:49.315 --> 35:52.384
which was part of the armistice
that the Emerald Chain

35:52.484 --> 35:55.221
eventually proposed
to the Federation.

35:58.357 --> 36:00.326
He died a political prisoner

36:00.426 --> 36:03.128
before he could see
any of that happen.

36:06.465 --> 36:09.435
My father always said
being an Orion meant

36:09.535 --> 36:11.437
we had an even greater
responsibility

36:11.537 --> 36:14.172
to speak out against
what the Chain was doing.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.311
Sorry for

36:19.411 --> 36:21.980
shutting you down earlier.

36:22.080 --> 36:24.049
The cave wasn't a bad idea.

36:25.551 --> 36:26.518
That's good.

36:26.618 --> 36:28.454
That's really good, you guys.

36:28.554 --> 36:31.457
You're talking.
We need so much more of that.

36:31.557 --> 36:35.994
Right now, we need to make it
to that ridge. Right?

36:36.094 --> 36:37.363
You with me?

36:37.463 --> 36:39.431
-Yeah.
-Yes.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.133
Come on, guys, you're Starfleet
now. It's "Aye."

36:42.234 --> 36:43.702
ALL: Aye!

36:43.802 --> 36:47.539
TILLY:
Nice work, cadets.
Let's go. Move out!

36:59.585 --> 37:01.219
BURNHAM:
The fact that you are both here

37:01.320 --> 37:03.422
means you are ready
to look forward.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.957
That has never been in dispute.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.694
Yet you're allowing past
mistakes to define that future.

37:08.794 --> 37:11.663
Logic dictates that
the lessons we learn

37:11.763 --> 37:13.332
should inform our choices.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.335
Choices are never
purely logical, are they?

37:16.435 --> 37:19.170
There's always emotions.

37:20.306 --> 37:23.475
If I may reference
my own history,

37:23.575 --> 37:27.646
the Culling of my family,
my ancestors.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.282
It will always be a personal
challenge for me

37:30.382 --> 37:32.284
to trust the Ba'ul.

37:32.384 --> 37:36.221
Yet I cannot deny that
Kaminar is far stronger

37:36.322 --> 37:38.256
now that it is united.

37:38.357 --> 37:41.092
And couldn't the same be said
about Ni'Var?

37:41.192 --> 37:43.194
The divisions between
the Vulcans and Romulans

37:43.295 --> 37:46.164
were so vast and lasted
so many millennia

37:46.264 --> 37:49.401
that they forgot they were
the same species.

37:49.501 --> 37:53.171
Even your ancestry
is a testament to hope.

37:53.271 --> 37:56.308
The Cardassians waged war
against Bajor and humanity,

37:56.408 --> 37:59.545
and now, today,
all three are at peace.

37:59.645 --> 38:03.248
Because they were willing
to grow and change together.

38:03.349 --> 38:05.984
Your words are inspiring,

38:06.084 --> 38:07.686
Captain Burnham.

38:08.687 --> 38:10.322
But words alone
are not sufficient.

38:10.422 --> 38:12.458
I understand that you
and Captain Saru

38:12.558 --> 38:14.960
are here to propose
a compromise.

38:15.060 --> 38:16.428
BURNHAM:
We are.

38:16.528 --> 38:19.197
Within Starfleet,
disputes between

38:19.297 --> 38:22.501
high-ranking officers
can be resolved by a committee,

38:22.601 --> 38:25.036
whose sole purpose
is to provide objectivity

38:25.136 --> 38:27.339
and guide both parties
to a resolution.

38:27.439 --> 38:30.275
We propose a committee--
independent

38:30.376 --> 38:32.978
of Federation leadership--
to conduct regular reviews

38:33.078 --> 38:35.013
will all member worlds.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.949
Not just Ni'Var.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.952
Ni'Var has already
refused any oversight

38:41.052 --> 38:43.689
that does not include
one of its own citizens.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.492
Is that any more egregious
than insisting Starfleet

38:46.592 --> 38:49.160
be given a voice
within a civilian quorum?

38:49.260 --> 38:51.229
BURNHAM:
If you would,

38:51.329 --> 38:54.265
allow me to serve
on this committee.

38:54.366 --> 38:57.569
I am a citizen of Ni'Var,
trained in logic,

38:57.669 --> 38:59.371
witness to your history,

38:59.471 --> 39:02.007
and I am an officer
in Starfleet.

39:02.107 --> 39:05.343
Captain of a starship
and citizen of the Federation.

39:05.444 --> 39:07.546
I will be the bridge between you

39:07.646 --> 39:10.616
until you no longer need it.

39:24.730 --> 39:29.067
This proposal is acceptable
to the Federation.

39:29.167 --> 39:33.472
It is an elegant solution.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.578
*

39:53.391 --> 39:56.995
The storm will interfere with
our personal transporters,

39:57.095 --> 39:59.064
so it'll take at least
60 seconds for the Armstrong

39:59.164 --> 40:00.331
to get a lock
and beam us up.

40:00.432 --> 40:04.536
(creatures howling)

40:04.636 --> 40:06.337
I hope they can hear us.

40:06.438 --> 40:08.373
-They have to.
-They will.

40:08.474 --> 40:12.143
60 seconds is long enough
for it to get to us.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.612
We have to distract it.

40:13.712 --> 40:16.047
I'm gonna turn on my comms,
and I'm gonna run.

40:16.147 --> 40:20.218
-Draw its attention.
-That's a terrible idea.
-Agreed.

40:20.318 --> 40:23.188
Okay, you guys saved my life.
All right? I owe you.

40:23.288 --> 40:26.391
And someone's got to do it.
You know I'm right.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.328
TILLY:
Yeah.

40:30.428 --> 40:33.364
You are right.
You are right.

40:33.465 --> 40:36.401
Someone's got to do it,
so it's gonna be me.

40:36.502 --> 40:39.137
-Wait...
-That's an order, ensign.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.274
Once I'm clear,
you turn on comms.

40:43.374 --> 40:45.243
You call, keep calling.
Don't stop.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.246
You got this.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.084
We've all got this, okay?

40:53.184 --> 40:54.486
Now, on my mark.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.398
TILLY:
Are you ready?

41:07.499 --> 41:09.367
CADETS:
Aye, Lieutenant.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.773
The minute you get a signal,
call the Armstrong.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.383
(screeching)

41:26.752 --> 41:28.086
ADIRA:
Adira Tal

41:28.186 --> 41:30.155
to U.S.S. Armstrong.
Come in.

41:31.456 --> 41:33.291
Armstrong, acknowledge.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.295
Okay, no. It's too close to her.
We have to help.

41:37.395 --> 41:39.330
Fire phasers to draw it off.

41:42.801 --> 41:45.070
(screeching)

41:45.170 --> 41:47.673
Holy shit!
Here comes the other one.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.808
-They're coming right at us!
-Keep firing.

41:54.479 --> 41:56.715
ADIRA:
Armstrong, acknowledge.
Please acknowledge.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.987
IMAHARA:
This is Captain Imahara
of the U.S.S. Armstrong.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.656
-It's them!
-Armstrong, get us the hell
out of here!

42:08.493 --> 42:09.595
Armstrong!

42:18.804 --> 42:21.673
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

42:25.110 --> 42:27.412
MAN (over P.A.):
Ensign Moore, please report
to briefing room seven.

42:27.512 --> 42:29.180
Ensign Moore,

42:29.280 --> 42:30.415
-briefing room seven.
-I just finished reading

42:30.515 --> 42:33.084
the Armstrong's report.

42:33.184 --> 42:38.089
The loss of Lieutenant Callum
is a tragedy.

42:38.189 --> 42:40.525
Frankly, I'm-I'm amazed
any of you survived.

42:40.626 --> 42:42.393
Well, the cadets
really pulled it together

42:42.493 --> 42:44.129
when it mattered.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.396
Honestly, any of them would be

42:45.496 --> 42:47.298
an excellent addition
to any crew.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.167
And when that opportunity comes,

42:49.267 --> 42:50.702
they'll have you
to thank for it.

42:52.103 --> 42:54.572
You know, when Discovery
first arrived,

42:54.673 --> 42:56.675
no one here trusted you.

42:56.775 --> 43:00.378
It wasn't just that you were
in a 930-year-old starship

43:00.478 --> 43:02.313
and had never heard of the Burn,

43:02.413 --> 43:04.650
it was the way
you carried yourselves,

43:04.750 --> 43:07.318
like you grew up in a world
that believes

43:07.418 --> 43:09.755
anything is possible.

43:10.789 --> 43:13.625
Quite frankly, it-it stung.

43:13.725 --> 43:16.194
And is exactly what
this new generation

43:16.294 --> 43:19.230
of cadets needs
as the Federation rebuilds.

43:19.330 --> 43:22.433
Well, after what
you've just endured,

43:22.533 --> 43:25.336
I can understand that an offer
to teach at the Academy

43:25.436 --> 43:27.538
is unlikely to fall
on willing ears,

43:27.639 --> 43:29.507
but the opening is there.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.110
Anytime.

43:34.412 --> 43:37.315
Thank you, sir.

43:41.720 --> 43:45.323
I never thought
that I'd say this,

43:45.423 --> 43:48.794
but I think that
I'm glad I came.

43:50.261 --> 43:52.698
I-I just... I...

43:52.798 --> 43:56.567
I think I might have actually
made some friends today.

43:56.668 --> 43:58.036
I wish I knew how to do it

43:58.136 --> 44:00.038
without nearly getting
eaten by a blob,

44:00.138 --> 44:03.141
but...

44:03.241 --> 44:04.542
You know, you are one of the
most brilliant people

44:04.642 --> 44:06.712
that I have ever met.

44:06.812 --> 44:10.982
Do you ever wonder why
you start with "I can't"

44:11.082 --> 44:13.451
when it comes to making
new connections?

44:13.551 --> 44:18.056
-Just seems kind of impossible.
-Well,

44:18.156 --> 44:21.526
when I see you,
and I see everything

44:21.626 --> 44:24.162
that you have been through

44:24.262 --> 44:27.733
and accomplished,

44:27.833 --> 44:31.636
you're a reminder to me
that everything is possible.

44:39.644 --> 44:41.679
Welcome home, Madam President.

44:41.780 --> 44:44.482
Thank you, President Rillak.

44:50.856 --> 44:53.024
Billions of futures
have been changed

44:53.124 --> 44:55.460
thanks to what
we've done here today.

44:55.560 --> 44:59.998
I must commend both of you
on a job well done.

45:00.098 --> 45:03.434
Madam President, thank you
for taking this first step

45:03.534 --> 45:05.937
with the Federation.

45:06.037 --> 45:07.138
If I may,

45:07.238 --> 45:09.507
there's a matter on my mind.

45:09.607 --> 45:12.410
You are curious about
the Qowat Milat sister, J'Vini--

45:12.510 --> 45:14.980
if she will face justice
for her actions?

45:15.080 --> 45:16.247
Yes, ma'am.

45:16.347 --> 45:18.583
J'Vini will go to Pijar,

45:18.683 --> 45:20.952
a monastic world
in the Pella system.

45:21.052 --> 45:24.389
There she will devote herself to
deep rehabilitative meditation

45:24.489 --> 45:26.457
under your mother's
careful guidance.

45:26.557 --> 45:28.293
They leave tonight.

45:28.393 --> 45:31.096
My mom said she had
big news for me.

45:31.196 --> 45:35.300
J'Vini helped rebuild
Dr. Burnham's life.

45:35.400 --> 45:37.635
Now it seems their roles
are reversed.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.972
In time, she will also
make amends to the family

45:41.072 --> 45:43.108
of the slain Starfleet officer.

45:43.208 --> 45:46.011
I hope this sets
your mind at ease.

45:46.111 --> 45:47.278
Thank you.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.050
Captain Saru.

45:54.552 --> 45:56.687
Will you join me for tea?

45:56.788 --> 45:59.390
It would be my pleasure.

46:10.368 --> 46:14.072
For someone
who dislikes politics,

46:14.172 --> 46:16.975
you show an aptitude for it.

46:17.075 --> 46:20.145
I assume the admiral
made a miraculous recovery?

46:20.245 --> 46:23.681
Well, now that you mention it,
he was looking, well, better

46:23.781 --> 46:25.450
last time I saw him.

46:25.550 --> 46:27.385
Hmm.

46:27.485 --> 46:29.587
I received a piece
of intelligence this morning

46:29.687 --> 46:32.090
indicating the exit clause
request was coming.

46:32.190 --> 46:34.125
I had to protect my source.

46:34.225 --> 46:35.994
President T'rina.

46:36.094 --> 46:37.328
Mm-hmm.

46:40.065 --> 46:41.732
(sighs)

46:41.833 --> 46:44.669
If you wanted my help,
you could have just asked me.

46:44.769 --> 46:47.472
Truth be told...

46:47.572 --> 46:50.508
I wasn't sure you were
the right person for the job.

46:50.608 --> 46:53.311
But I'm glad you were.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.314
I appreciate that.

46:57.315 --> 46:59.985
I know transparency
isn't always possible

47:00.085 --> 47:01.486
in your position.

47:01.586 --> 47:05.023
But it is what I need
to best serve you

47:05.123 --> 47:06.691
and the Federation.

47:06.791 --> 47:09.928
So if you could be more
forthcoming in the future,

47:10.028 --> 47:13.431
I would appreciate that
as well.

47:13.531 --> 47:16.367
Understood, Captain.

47:21.539 --> 47:24.575
I will see you back at
headquarters in a few days.

47:44.662 --> 47:47.432
*

48:10.055 --> 48:11.256
Wow.

48:11.356 --> 48:14.192
Guess I've got a lot
to work out.

48:15.726 --> 48:17.395
What do I do with it?

48:17.495 --> 48:20.565
Well, when the mandala's
finished, it's...

48:21.732 --> 48:24.035
...wiped away.

48:26.171 --> 48:28.339
You do this yourself?

48:29.740 --> 48:31.642
Are there...

48:31.742 --> 48:34.345
are there things
you need to wipe away?

48:38.083 --> 48:39.717
Sure.

48:40.718 --> 48:43.021
You want to talk about it?

48:45.290 --> 48:47.025
Someday.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.539
-(door chimes)
-Come.

49:04.109 --> 49:06.211
I heard about what happened
on the mission.

49:08.046 --> 49:09.147
How are you doing?

49:09.247 --> 49:12.583
You know,
crash into an ice moon,

49:12.683 --> 49:14.952
stranded in an electrical storm,

49:15.053 --> 49:17.122
chased by
a flesh-melting alien, so...

49:17.222 --> 49:19.457
-typical day.
-(laughs)

49:23.528 --> 49:26.031
I know there's been
something on your mind

49:30.301 --> 49:31.936
We haven't really sat
in here together

49:32.037 --> 49:34.939
since you became captain.

49:35.040 --> 49:36.941
Right.

49:37.042 --> 49:39.244
Remember when we first
became roomies? (laughs)

49:39.344 --> 49:44.082
I was so scared to bunk
with a famous mutineer.

49:44.182 --> 49:47.052
I think I, like,
I think I laid awake at night

49:47.152 --> 49:48.486
because I was scared
you were gonna, like,

49:48.586 --> 49:50.355
knife me in the back
or something.

49:50.455 --> 49:53.224
Well, you snored like crazy.

49:53.324 --> 49:54.992
-(gasps)
-I had to get the computer

49:55.093 --> 49:57.295
to block out the frequency
so I could get any sleep.

49:57.395 --> 50:00.631
So sorry!

50:00.731 --> 50:03.034
I only blocked it out
for a few days,

50:03.134 --> 50:04.469
and then I...

50:04.569 --> 50:06.671
I kind of started liking it.

50:06.771 --> 50:08.539
Really?

50:08.639 --> 50:10.408
-Really.
-You're weird.

50:16.781 --> 50:19.750
You want to go back,
don't you?

50:21.852 --> 50:23.988
I do.

50:24.089 --> 50:26.191
Why?

50:26.291 --> 50:30.027
Because getting
my lieutenant pips

50:30.128 --> 50:33.030
was the worst day of my life.

50:36.601 --> 50:38.069
You know, I-I never
could figure out

50:38.169 --> 50:41.106
how my mother
became a diplomat.

50:41.206 --> 50:44.542
She was such a hardass at home.

50:44.642 --> 50:48.313
No compromise.
She had everything planned out.

50:48.413 --> 50:50.548
She had my whole life
planned out.

50:50.648 --> 50:53.017
So when I told her that
I wanted to join Starfleet

50:53.118 --> 50:56.621
instead of
the diplomatic corps, sh...

50:59.857 --> 51:04.962
So I always thought that
I was doing this for me.

51:05.062 --> 51:08.699
But then, when I got
the pips...

51:08.799 --> 51:11.169
all of a sudden
I realized, like,

51:11.269 --> 51:14.972
my mom is 900 years
in the past.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.275
She's never gonna
see me wear them.

51:17.375 --> 51:20.378
And I started wondering

51:20.478 --> 51:22.713
if this is what I really wanted,
or if I just

51:22.813 --> 51:27.452
really wanted to be seen.

51:27.552 --> 51:32.223
You know.
And that was humbling.

51:32.323 --> 51:34.625
But I think it could be
a useful perspective

51:34.725 --> 51:36.561
for a teacher.

51:39.297 --> 51:41.432
Well...

51:41.532 --> 51:44.068
-I'll miss seeing
your face every day.
-No.

51:44.169 --> 51:46.537
It's not forever.
You'll still see me around

51:46.637 --> 51:48.439
-Fed HQ.
-Right.

51:48.539 --> 51:50.107
And then, you know,
if it's really bad,

51:50.208 --> 51:52.009
I can get Zora to record me
while I'm sleeping

51:52.109 --> 51:54.245
so you can listen to me snoring
like I know you love to do.

51:54.345 --> 51:56.314
I said I kind of liked it.

51:56.414 --> 51:57.315
You know you love it!

51:57.415 --> 51:58.583
(both laughing)

51:58.683 --> 52:01.552
Let's not get crazy.

52:05.055 --> 52:07.091
