00:23.624 --> 00:26.260
Oh, what a headache.

00:26.294 --> 00:28.762
I really need peace
and quiet today.

00:32.466 --> 00:33.767
Ah! What was that?

00:33.801 --> 00:36.504
That, Raven, was crazy!

00:36.537 --> 00:39.473
Oh, no.
Please don't tell me
today is...

00:39.507 --> 00:42.576
ALL: Crazy Day!

00:44.612 --> 00:46.780
(ELECTRONIC DANCE
MUSIC PLAYING)

00:55.723 --> 00:56.857
Check it out!

00:56.890 --> 00:59.293
We're eating cereal
with forks.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.562
What?

01:01.595 --> 01:02.830
Milk in your face!

01:02.863 --> 01:04.832
How does the milk stay
on the fork?

01:04.865 --> 01:07.568
It doesn't! It doesn't!

01:07.601 --> 01:10.171
Ooh-hoo! I have the big shoes.

01:10.204 --> 01:13.641
It is enough
to drive one crazy!

01:14.408 --> 01:16.144
Okay. Stop right now!

01:16.177 --> 01:18.246
Not until one of us
out-crazy's the rest

01:18.279 --> 01:22.082
and is and is named
the new Captain Crazy!

01:25.186 --> 01:29.323
Okay, you do Crazy Day
every year and I still
don't know what the point is.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.491
There is no point.

01:30.524 --> 01:32.160
Isn't that crazy!

01:37.498 --> 01:39.167
Today's not the day for this.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.669
Actually, today is the day
for this, mama.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.205
It's cray-cray-cray-cray...
Crazy day!

01:44.238 --> 01:46.874
Why do you never participate
in the competition?

01:46.907 --> 01:51.379
Maybe because you guys
already drive me crazy,
every day!

01:51.412 --> 01:52.546
I'm going to go lie down.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.248
On the ceiling?

01:54.282 --> 01:55.649
Crazy!

01:57.518 --> 01:58.852
Ugh.

01:58.886 --> 02:03.357
Why do they have to do
Crazy Day when I have
this splitting headache?

02:03.391 --> 02:04.825
What's going on?

02:07.661 --> 02:08.896
Where am I?

02:08.929 --> 02:10.731
RAVEN'S VOICE:
You are in your mind.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.200
Oh, no wonder it's so dark.

02:12.233 --> 02:16.937
And it's about to get darker,
because I'm here to break it!

02:26.447 --> 02:28.249
Cute.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.451
But if you want to drive
me crazy, you'll have
to do better than that.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.785
Oh, don't worry.

02:31.819 --> 02:35.256
I know exactly
how to drive you crazy.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.460
Well, that laugh's
kind of annoying.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.494
You got that going.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.696
Oh, my feelings.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.803
I know we're not allowed
in there but

02:49.837 --> 02:51.405
maybe we should see
what's going on.

02:53.374 --> 02:56.944
Well, yes, my dear sir, I am.

02:56.977 --> 02:59.313
Woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo-hoo!

03:03.684 --> 03:04.818
Raven?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.587
-Oh, sorry.
-Ahh!

03:06.620 --> 03:07.921
Raven's not here.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.558
I've taken over
her mind and body.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.362
Lying on the ceiling,
crazy voice...

03:14.395 --> 03:15.563
She's doing it!

03:15.596 --> 03:17.731
She's going after
your crazy crown!

03:17.765 --> 03:20.734
Crazy voices rule.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.904
Beast Boy's not here either.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.408
She said she did not want
to be crazy on Crazy Day,

03:27.441 --> 03:30.744
but she is the most craziest
of us all.

03:30.778 --> 03:32.546
Oh, thank you.

03:32.580 --> 03:36.417
I have been called
the Lord of Madness
from time to time.

03:36.450 --> 03:39.487
Uh, what's wrong with them?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.988
If they
haven't driven me crazy yet,

03:41.021 --> 03:42.823
there's not much hope for you.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.692
Don't give up on them
just yet, Raven.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.394
What's that supposed to mean?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.528
You'll see.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.398
Now, if you want me out,
come and get me.

03:54.502 --> 03:57.505
Ooh, this is so mysterious.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.739
STARFIRE: Halt!

03:58.772 --> 04:00.541
What are you supposed to be?

04:00.574 --> 04:02.810
To pass me the by
and go the way,

04:02.843 --> 04:05.613
the answer to my riddle
you must say.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.548
Go for it. I love riddles.

04:09.683 --> 04:15.789
What is running and walks
with a mouth and talks and
has a head and also the bed?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.358
What?

04:17.391 --> 04:18.759
Did I misspoken the riddle?

04:18.792 --> 04:21.061
Yeah, you definitely
misspoken it.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.630
I will try again.

04:22.663 --> 04:28.969
What runs with its head
to its bed and a mouth
is having and does not walk?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.438
Really.

04:30.471 --> 04:33.874
What has a bed in its mouth
and is talking but also
not walking to his...

04:33.907 --> 04:36.910
You are starting
to drive me crazy!

04:36.944 --> 04:38.879
This is a very
difficult riddle.

04:38.912 --> 04:40.981
That's the point!

04:41.715 --> 04:43.417
I'm sorry.

04:43.451 --> 04:46.387
Just take your time
and try to remember
what the riddle's about.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.755
Well, I...

04:47.788 --> 04:49.490
Do you even know
what the answer is?

04:49.523 --> 04:50.791
Of course, I do.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.526
Yeah, right.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.495
It is the river, Raven.

04:54.528 --> 04:55.663
Cool, the answer is river.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.299
You may pass.

05:00.968 --> 05:04.037
Oh, you think that's crazy,
watch this!

05:05.406 --> 05:06.674
How do you like my hat?

05:08.542 --> 05:11.078
Ray-Ray is so cray-cray!

05:12.746 --> 05:15.082
That is not even the hat.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.552
I think I know
who our new Captain Crazy's
gonna be.

05:18.586 --> 05:22.790
No way! I refuse to let Raven
be the craziest on Crazy Day.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.958
Come on, Robin,
you have to up your game.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.130
The Crazy Day is supposed
to be fun, Robin.

05:30.163 --> 05:32.800
Yeah, dude,
you're starting to scare us.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.834
You're acting kinda crazy.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.103
Good!

05:36.136 --> 05:38.972
But not crazy enough.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.709
Time for some crazy training!

05:44.878 --> 05:48.749
Robin's push downs
make none of the sense.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.420
That is one crazy straw, bro!

05:52.453 --> 05:53.887
VOICE: Yee-haw.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.929
What is wrong with him?

06:01.962 --> 06:04.532
He can't afford to sell
those TV's at such low prices!

06:04.565 --> 06:07.501
He must be crazy!

06:07.535 --> 06:09.069
Crazy!

06:16.910 --> 06:19.046
So, what are you two
supposed to be?

06:19.079 --> 06:22.550
Well, we sort of like
challenged you to a game,
or whatever.

06:22.583 --> 06:26.854
Yes, it is a game of checkers,
to the death!

06:27.921 --> 06:30.758
This is actually chess,
not checkers.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.793
-Ugh!

06:35.596 --> 06:36.764
Your move.

06:39.533 --> 06:40.701
Yes!

06:43.871 --> 06:45.906
We're moving, uh!
We're moving, uh!

06:45.939 --> 06:47.107
Uh-huh.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.809
That's right.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.778
I have no legs.
I have no legs.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.179
Are you kidding me?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.882
How can chess pieces
not know how to play chess?

06:54.915 --> 06:57.017
Hey, we've never been
chess pieces till now.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.854
How can I win
if you don't know how to play?

07:00.888 --> 07:02.723
Dude, that's a good question.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.057
And the answer is...

07:04.091 --> 07:07.194
She can't win, bro,
which means we can't lose.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.796
Awesome!

07:08.829 --> 07:10.598
I'd high five you
if I had hands!

07:10.631 --> 07:14.535
Can't let them drive me crazy.
Can't let them drive me cra...

07:14.568 --> 07:16.203
Go ahead, celebrate.

07:16.236 --> 07:19.006
She's right.
This moment is too beautiful
not to commemorate.

07:19.039 --> 07:22.042
If we can't high five,
then let's high forehead!

07:28.816 --> 07:30.818
You surrendered your king.
I win.

07:34.522 --> 07:35.689
Okay, Raven,

07:35.723 --> 07:38.726
this is for Captain Crazy!

07:44.131 --> 07:45.833
One move. Go!

07:48.602 --> 07:51.972
-She doesn't even
need glasses.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.141
Oh, I can't compete with that.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.248
You would be
the last obstacle.

08:01.281 --> 08:05.218
That's right, Raven,
no one drives you
crazier than I do.

08:05.252 --> 08:09.690
Now, if you want to pass
you must answer a riddle.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.191
Already done that.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.728
Oh.
In that case, you have to win
a game of chess.

08:14.762 --> 08:16.196
Did that too.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.197
Really?

08:17.230 --> 08:20.133
Well, then you have to, uh...
You have to...

08:22.269 --> 08:24.838
Ah, never mind, come on in.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.774
Ow! My nose!

08:41.254 --> 08:42.289
You!

08:43.190 --> 08:45.158
Hi, honey.

08:45.192 --> 08:46.126
Lose your mind yet?

08:46.159 --> 08:48.996
Using imagery of my friends
to drive me crazy.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.131
Was all this
about turning me evil?

08:52.900 --> 08:55.235
Eh, got me. Did it work?

08:55.268 --> 08:58.038
Of course not!
I already spend every day
with them.

08:58.071 --> 09:00.240
You could never drive me
as crazy as they do.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.909
Oh, I don't know.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.777
They actually seem pretty fun.

09:03.811 --> 09:06.647
Oh, then you should spend
more time with them.

09:06.680 --> 09:08.749
Azarath Metrion Zinthos!

09:14.955 --> 09:16.590
Oh, what's happening?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.792
Hey, why'd you do that?

09:21.895 --> 09:24.197
They sure are loud.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.332
Stop that.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.300
-Stop calling me "bro."

09:27.334 --> 09:29.603
"
-BEAST BOY: In your face.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.338
No, I do not wish to train.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.240
I do not paint my toe nails!

09:33.273 --> 09:34.808
Tofu is not a food!

09:34.842 --> 09:36.710
Nobody says "Booyah" anymore.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.746
You're all driving me crazy!

09:45.986 --> 09:47.354
What are you looking at?

09:47.387 --> 09:51.759
The new Captain Crazy!

09:53.326 --> 09:54.695
Congratulations.

09:54.728 --> 09:56.329
-Ray-Ray's so cray-cray!
-Oh, yeah!

09:57.765 --> 09:59.099
No, you don't get it.
I'm not crazy

09:59.132 --> 10:02.402
I mean, you all drive me crazy
all the time.

10:02.435 --> 10:06.707
But you know what, in the end,
that's what keeps me sane.

10:06.740 --> 10:09.643
Uh, that makes no sense.

10:12.746 --> 10:15.683
Crazy Day!

10:15.716 --> 10:17.150
VOICE: I'm not crazy!
