WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.500
- Previously on
"Emerald City"...

00:04.410 --> 00:05.610
- You are the only child of
Samuel and Katherine Pastoria.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.280
- What kind of a name is Ozma?

00:07.310 --> 00:08.650
- It means "Leader of Oz."

00:08.680 --> 00:10.350
- Dorothy's not an assassin.

00:10.380 --> 00:12.390
- The Wizard sent her
to kill me.

00:12.410 --> 00:15.640
- - Take her life
and your heart will be free.

00:15.680 --> 00:17.250
- Stop Glinda.

00:17.290 --> 00:18.890
- But you have your giants.
Use them.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.590
- Their power is locked
in the Prison of the Abject.

00:20.620 --> 00:23.490
- Mistress East and I,
we had a partnership.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.920
- Prison of the Abject.
We can't unlock it.

00:25.960 --> 00:28.130
A witch's spells are her own.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.500
- I'm not drinking
a witch's insides.

00:33.530 --> 00:35.160
- You want revenge
for your parents.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.730
You want to destroy
the Wizard.

00:36.770 --> 00:39.270
Then taste my sister's magic.

00:39.310 --> 00:40.750
Tip!

00:40.770 --> 00:43.370
- Kill him!

00:50.450 --> 00:52.220
- It worked.

00:52.250 --> 00:54.220
- Are my weapons at the ready?

00:54.260 --> 00:55.690
- Guards!

00:55.720 --> 00:57.250
- You're joking.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.270
- Turn around

01:08.300 --> 01:10.430
and no harm will come to you.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.970
- I demand an audience
with the Queen!

01:13.010 --> 01:16.580
Not a captain of an army
who's never seen a fight!

01:16.610 --> 01:18.470
- Then there will be harm.

01:18.510 --> 01:20.940
- Those weapons that you have!

01:20.980 --> 01:24.550
They were manufactured
to outfit my men.

01:24.590 --> 01:26.560
- The guns are ours.

01:28.390 --> 01:32.600
- The people of Ev,
they know I've been generous.

01:32.630 --> 01:37.270
And now the Queen will know
how grateful I am.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.800
Perhaps this payment

01:40.830 --> 01:44.570
will help the girl
come to her senses.

01:50.780 --> 01:52.350
- Let them in.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.260
Just the gold.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.220
- He's doubled his payment.

02:11.570 --> 02:16.310
My Queen,
The Beast is nearly upon us.

02:16.340 --> 02:18.480
You're dooming us
to repeat the past

02:18.510 --> 02:20.580
if the Wizard cannot defend us.

02:20.610 --> 02:24.750
- The weapons are all the power
we need to defend ourselves.

02:26.610 --> 02:29.450
Let his kingdom
be destroyed this time.

02:30.820 --> 02:36.300
And let us take away any
currency he needs to rebuild it.

02:36.320 --> 02:39.250
- You're making an enemy
of The Wizard.

02:42.500 --> 02:45.440
- What would
my father have done?

02:45.470 --> 02:47.540
- Accept the payment.

02:48.870 --> 02:50.680
- Then so will I.

02:53.710 --> 02:55.650
And I'll keep the guns.

03:05.590 --> 03:09.060
- We have your gold.
We have your guns.

03:09.090 --> 03:12.500
We no longer need
The Wizard of Oz.

03:14.900 --> 03:16.500
- Don't go.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.060
You can't go.

03:18.100 --> 03:21.510
What am I supposed to do
without you?

03:21.540 --> 03:25.780
- The pain...
it never stopped.

03:27.710 --> 03:28.910
Maybe on the other side...

03:28.940 --> 03:31.470
- No.
I was just there.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.610
I saw my family.

03:35.780 --> 03:38.550
I felt them,

03:38.590 --> 03:40.890
how they loved me.

03:40.920 --> 03:46.460
I watched them murdered by a man
wearing the mask of a lion.

03:47.730 --> 03:50.570
I know every detail.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.670
That was death.

03:55.770 --> 03:58.340
Please don't become that.

04:00.810 --> 04:02.680
Please...

04:12.720 --> 04:16.589
- My sister...

04:16.620 --> 04:19.959
do you feel her inside you?

04:21.959 --> 04:25.160
What does she command?

04:25.200 --> 04:26.840
- A message.

04:26.870 --> 04:29.510
For you.

04:29.540 --> 04:31.640
- Tell me.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.570
- She wants you to get up
off your sorry ass and help me.

04:39.510 --> 04:43.410
Well, that's what
she would have said.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.710
- Soldier, move away
from the gold.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.820
What are you doing?

05:22.860 --> 05:25.460
- The destruction is coming.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.690
Currency to protect my family.

05:29.730 --> 05:31.760
Yours too.

05:36.500 --> 05:38.430
Where's your Queen?

05:49.880 --> 05:53.680
Where is your Queen?

07:01.020 --> 07:03.020
- If anyone comes...

07:36.860 --> 07:38.960
- Lucas, not like this...

07:40.060 --> 07:41.590
Look at me!

07:41.630 --> 07:44.670
At least look at me!

07:59.280 --> 08:00.290
- Now that I've got
all this witch stuff inside me,

08:02.120 --> 08:05.090
can't we just, you know,
fly to wherever?

08:05.120 --> 08:08.130
- If we fly,
Glinda will find out about you.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.000
Then she'll want you
for her own.

08:10.020 --> 08:11.950
- Why would she want me?

08:11.990 --> 08:15.120
- You have the powers
of a Cardinal Witch.

08:15.160 --> 08:17.090
It's a force
to be reckoned with.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.960
- I don't feel like it.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.640
I don't feel any magic.

08:27.170 --> 08:30.410
- And what does that feel like?

08:30.440 --> 08:32.610
- Like...

08:36.120 --> 08:37.960
nothing.

08:37.990 --> 08:39.929
I died and came back to life.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.690
Surely I can cast
a stupid spell.

08:44.020 --> 08:47.220
- You don't summon magic.

08:48.930 --> 08:50.400
It comes for you.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.160
- How?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.160
- Sit down.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.110
Close your eyes.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.650
Now tell me,
what do you feel?

09:15.190 --> 09:17.200
- Hatred.

09:17.220 --> 09:20.160
For The Wizard and the man
who killed my family.

09:20.190 --> 09:22.890
- Absorb it.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.330
Take it with you.

09:25.370 --> 09:27.340
Then go deeper still.

09:29.470 --> 09:32.080
Something's happening.
I-I can't stop it.

09:32.110 --> 09:34.450
- You're not supposed to.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.220
How did you do that?

10:11.240 --> 10:13.180
- I didn't.

10:15.120 --> 10:17.260
This is what the magic found.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.210
This is me!

10:35.400 --> 10:37.070
Why?

10:39.440 --> 10:42.050
- You should have never been.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.780
- But I am.

10:43.810 --> 10:45.510
- You should have never
happened.

10:45.550 --> 10:50.790
I'd send you home if I could,
but it's not possible.

10:50.820 --> 10:54.030
- Neither we were before we fell
into this world, but I did.

10:54.050 --> 10:56.250
- And it's wrong.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.830
You being here...
You...

10:58.860 --> 11:02.230
You can't be part of me.

11:02.260 --> 11:04.130
You can't.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.290
Not anymore.

11:06.330 --> 11:08.360
- So do it.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.330
Kill me.

11:10.370 --> 11:14.140
Do it.
Do it!

11:14.170 --> 11:16.000
Do it!

11:19.610 --> 11:22.310
You can't, can you?

11:29.090 --> 11:31.200
- Close your eyes.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.190
Close your eyes.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.030
Ahh!

12:18.510 --> 12:22.110
Stop me!
Dorothy, please, stop me!

12:22.140 --> 12:25.140
Use the gauntlets, please!

12:25.180 --> 12:26.450
Stop me!

12:26.480 --> 12:27.920
- I can't.

12:27.950 --> 12:29.520
I don't want you dead...

12:29.550 --> 12:31.460
I don't want you dead.

12:32.590 --> 12:35.390
- Stop me, Dorothy!

12:35.420 --> 12:37.920
Stop me!

13:02.420 --> 13:04.490
No...

13:48.030 --> 13:50.000
You got your wish.

13:58.570 --> 14:01.140
- I never happened to you.

14:34.610 --> 14:36.210
- You have my gold.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.170
- And your guns.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.210
- Do you wonder
why you're still alive

14:40.250 --> 14:43.790
when these men in this room have
killed everyone else around you?

14:43.820 --> 14:45.790
- If you kill me,

14:45.820 --> 14:48.060
my soldiers kill yours.

14:48.090 --> 14:50.330
You've lost your army
to fight Glinda.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.000
The end.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.170
- I see you're very smart.

15:06.840 --> 15:09.210
You're a clever girl.

15:13.180 --> 15:14.680
Ahh!

15:29.230 --> 15:33.110
- I know your father is
no longer around to teach you.

15:33.130 --> 15:38.200
So let me give you a lesson
in how to negotiate properly.

15:38.240 --> 15:41.450
You make yourself presentable
for your soldiers.

15:41.470 --> 15:44.670
And choose a new mask.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.210
It might be your last.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.750
- Jane!

15:53.790 --> 15:56.230
Jane! Jane, you have to help!

15:56.260 --> 15:57.700
- What happened?

15:57.720 --> 15:59.350
- The Wizard and his men
have Langwidere.

15:59.390 --> 16:00.860
- The Wizard is here?

16:00.890 --> 16:02.360
- If her soldiers don't
turn over the guns,

16:02.400 --> 16:03.840
he's going to execute her.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.360
What do we do?

16:10.440 --> 16:11.780
Jane!

16:23.250 --> 16:25.810
- You hold the power
of my sacred sister,

16:25.850 --> 16:27.350
most Merciful and Stern.

16:27.390 --> 16:29.160
Try to be worthy.

16:29.190 --> 16:32.130
- I've never felt better.

16:33.830 --> 16:35.470
I'm free.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.800
- I'll split you in two
if you touch me with those.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.530
- That's what we'll do
to The Wizard.

16:39.570 --> 16:41.740
Tear him in two.
- Oh, grow up.

16:41.770 --> 16:44.140
Two witches aren't just going to
walk into Emerald City

16:44.170 --> 16:45.800
and unseat The Wizard alone.

16:45.840 --> 16:48.450
- Fine.
What else do we need?

16:48.480 --> 16:50.820
- Supporters.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.410
Your father had many
and that's who we'll recruit.

16:53.450 --> 16:55.290
- Then let's go.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.450
What?

16:59.490 --> 17:01.330
- You can't go like that.

17:01.350 --> 17:03.450
- Like what?

17:03.490 --> 17:05.819
- A boy.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.530
Ozma was born a girl.

17:08.560 --> 17:11.190
- But...

17:11.230 --> 17:15.160
this is what I've always been.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.170
This is who I really am.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.730
- You were born a girl.

17:18.770 --> 17:20.869
And if you don't change yourself
back into one,

17:20.910 --> 17:22.349
no one will follow you.

17:22.380 --> 17:23.780
You will never have
your revenge.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.310
- I finally have
what I care about most.

17:26.349 --> 17:28.550
Emerald City, the throne,
that's what you want.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.350
- That's why I gave you
my sister's powers!

17:31.380 --> 17:33.320
Not for your own
petty indulgences.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.480
- This isn't petty!
This is me!

17:35.520 --> 17:36.880
- So your parents will
go unavenged

17:36.920 --> 17:38.490
just so you can take a piss
standing up?

17:38.530 --> 17:40.800
- Don't!

17:40.830 --> 17:42.530
Don't.

17:45.400 --> 17:47.410
Don't do this to me.

17:47.430 --> 17:50.160
Don't make me choose.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.940
Do you have any idea

17:57.980 --> 18:00.790
what it was like for me

18:00.810 --> 18:03.910
to look in the mirror and see
a stranger staring back?

18:03.950 --> 18:08.550
To have someone else
all over me, infecting me?

18:08.590 --> 18:12.630
This... this...
This skin...

18:12.660 --> 18:17.200
It's the only thing
that was ever really mine.

18:18.670 --> 18:20.270
- Tip.

18:42.590 --> 18:46.600
- Yeah, I know, I'm trespass.
I remember.

18:48.530 --> 18:50.870
I don't want trouble
with any of you.

18:53.600 --> 18:55.030
I want Ojo.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.280
- Why did you take to a witch
who wanted to kill me?

19:11.320 --> 19:13.390
Because the one from the West
almost did.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.650
- You are Revenge.
- Answer me.

19:15.690 --> 19:18.960
- To free my wife
from the Prison of the Abject.

19:18.990 --> 19:20.320
- And did she?

19:22.030 --> 19:23.900
- Her words were false.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.630
- I want Nahara free too.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.930
And I have the power to do it.

19:32.100 --> 19:34.340
- What do you want from her?

19:34.370 --> 19:36.340
- The Stone Giants.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.080
The Eternal Warriors.

19:38.110 --> 19:41.040
To stop Glinda permanently.

19:41.080 --> 19:44.980
It took magic to raise them,
and The Wizard doesn't have any.

19:49.060 --> 19:52.460
But Nahara does,
doesn't she?

19:55.360 --> 19:58.060
I want her to raise
the Giants again.

19:58.100 --> 20:00.040
- For the Wizard?

20:21.790 --> 20:22.860
- We're done.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.620
Go your own way.

20:27.890 --> 20:29.990
- Without you,
there is no army.

20:30.030 --> 20:33.510
Without Ozma,
there is no Oz.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.960
- What does that mean?

20:37.000 --> 20:39.630
- We'll try it your way.

20:39.670 --> 20:40.900
As a boy.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.700
- Thank you.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.790
Thank you for understanding me.

21:13.570 --> 21:14.740
- Frank?

21:14.770 --> 21:16.000
- Frank? Who's that?

21:18.710 --> 21:21.640
It's familiar.
But lost.

21:21.680 --> 21:25.550
- So was everyone I cared about
when you damned me to live here.

21:28.690 --> 21:32.030
- You were never kind to me,
Jane.

21:33.660 --> 21:35.560
Do you remember?

21:36.900 --> 21:40.640
Despite how much
I tried to help you

21:40.670 --> 21:42.610
be who you were.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.010
- It was your job to help me.

21:44.040 --> 21:47.010
- Yet you didn't help me
when we found Oz.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.810
When it was my time.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.010
You even discredited me.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.810
- I'm the only one left
who knows you're a fraud.

21:54.850 --> 21:57.990
- It must hurt

21:58.020 --> 22:00.020
to know that no one will listen.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.120
- I know the only reason
you have kept me alive

22:05.160 --> 22:09.870
is because my work has value
to you.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.970
Tell me what you need.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.610
I-I'll make it for you now.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.640
- You came here
to save Langwidere.

22:24.680 --> 22:26.580
How very maternal of you.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.140
- She is just a girl!

22:28.180 --> 22:30.650
- She's standing
in the way of survival.

22:30.680 --> 22:32.680
- Frank, you have taken
everything else from me.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.030
Not this too.
You can't!

22:34.050 --> 22:36.580
- I am The Wizard of Oz!

22:38.020 --> 22:43.020
If you call me any name
other than that again...

22:43.060 --> 22:46.830
won't be her life
that you're begging for.

23:01.850 --> 23:04.090
- He can't be stopped.

23:05.820 --> 23:08.160
He'll destroy everything
for those guns.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.020
- Then make me the gun.

23:21.030 --> 23:23.570
- Why did you lie to me?

23:23.600 --> 23:28.570
When we first met, you told me
the Wizard animated the Giants.

23:28.610 --> 23:30.720
- He would have burnt
the Tribal Freelands

23:30.740 --> 23:32.010
if I spoke truth.

23:32.040 --> 23:34.780
- That's why
he imprisoned Nahara?

23:36.620 --> 23:38.020
To keep his secret.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.680
- Yes.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.720
Nahara was sacrifice.

23:43.760 --> 23:46.700
So our people lived.

23:46.730 --> 23:49.070
- Ojo, you deserve
to see her again.

23:49.100 --> 23:51.100
To have her home.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.750
- You'll bring Nahara to me?

24:14.790 --> 24:16.660
- Yes,

24:16.690 --> 24:19.030
but I'm not just gonna free
Nahara.

24:19.060 --> 24:21.230
I'm gonna free all of them.

25:05.910 --> 25:07.280
What happened to the Witches?

25:07.310 --> 25:09.810
- Free me...

25:09.840 --> 25:12.140
and I'll tell you.

25:30.060 --> 25:33.090
- Nahara... is... is she...

25:33.130 --> 25:35.860
- Only the sick
and dying remain.

25:35.900 --> 25:38.130
- The rest of the prisoners,
where are they?

25:38.170 --> 25:40.270
- Taken.

25:41.910 --> 25:44.150
- Taken? Taken by who?

25:44.180 --> 25:47.280
- Your army of Witches.

25:47.310 --> 25:49.840
Your army of magic.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.110
Dressed and ready for war!

26:08.300 --> 26:10.730
- I'm sorry, Ojo.

26:13.340 --> 26:15.150
- Nahara...

26:23.420 --> 26:26.290
- West took everyone
but the dead and dying.

26:47.770 --> 26:50.440
- I'm Dorothy Gale.
I ripped the sky.

26:54.550 --> 26:57.890
- Nahara...

26:57.920 --> 27:00.930
I need you to raise
the Eternal Warriors for me.

27:15.330 --> 27:17.460
- It will not be done.

27:19.810 --> 27:21.380
- It's the only way
to stop the war

27:21.410 --> 27:22.950
between Glinda and The Wizard.

27:36.420 --> 27:38.390
- War is good.

27:38.420 --> 27:39.450
- No. No.

27:39.490 --> 27:41.860
People will be killed, Nahara.

27:41.890 --> 27:44.430
Children will be killed.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.950
- Oz is magic.

28:01.980 --> 28:04.580
The Wizard is death.
- Yes.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.360
But if I help The Wizard,

28:06.390 --> 28:08.260
he's gonna take me
back to where I belong.

28:08.290 --> 28:11.830
And if you help me,
I'll take The Wizard with me.

28:13.990 --> 28:15.920
- Free magic?

28:15.960 --> 28:18.330
- Yes.

28:18.360 --> 28:20.330
Free magic.

28:28.310 --> 28:30.850
- This is why you had me drink
East's spells.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.620
Not for me.

28:32.640 --> 28:34.980
You just wanted her magic
so you could free your sisters.

28:35.010 --> 28:37.380
- I wanted you to have power.

28:37.420 --> 28:41.360
Be it magic, riches, or an army,
it makes no different.

28:41.390 --> 28:43.860
You take power
where you can find it.

28:45.560 --> 28:48.900
Their magic will unite with ours
to end The Wizard for good.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.460
- How do you know
they'll follow me?

28:53.500 --> 28:55.970
- I'll make them.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.870
In certain circles, I was known
as the Wicked Witch of the West.

29:00.910 --> 29:04.350
Yeah, I heard that.

29:15.450 --> 29:19.420
- As you once stood united
with King Pastoria,

29:19.460 --> 29:22.030
you now stand with his child,

29:22.060 --> 29:25.560
the one true heir
to the throne, Ozma.

29:25.600 --> 29:27.640
Follow us to Emerald City

29:27.670 --> 29:30.040
to end the one
who imprisoned you:

29:30.070 --> 29:32.540
the horrible Wizard of Oz!

29:32.570 --> 29:34.440
- Ozma is dead.

29:34.470 --> 29:36.400
- It's a boy in a dress!

29:36.440 --> 29:39.110
- What imposter
do you bring before us?

29:39.150 --> 29:42.590
- He possesses the the Emerald
Dagger given by his father.

29:42.610 --> 29:45.950
None can question
its authenticity.

29:48.990 --> 29:50.690
- It proves nothing.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.650
Possessions can be lost.

29:52.690 --> 29:54.520
And found.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.990
This boy is no Ozma.

29:57.030 --> 30:00.140
- I am a Cardinal Witch
and you will hear my truth

30:00.170 --> 30:01.940
or I'll gladly throw you
back in prison

30:01.970 --> 30:03.640
if you find it more agreeable.

30:03.670 --> 30:06.340
- None here will be intimidated
by The Wizard's whore.

30:06.370 --> 30:08.470
- I'm nobody's whore.
- You're worse.

30:08.510 --> 30:12.680
You're a traitor,
and you will speak no more.

30:12.710 --> 30:15.380
Mistress!

30:30.530 --> 30:33.040
- Are you ready, little Queen?

30:35.000 --> 30:37.160
I hope you've chosen wisely.

30:40.470 --> 30:42.070
- I have.

30:46.680 --> 30:48.190
- The Queen!

30:48.210 --> 30:50.140
- Ready your weapons!

30:50.180 --> 30:52.980
- Be calm!
I am sound.

30:56.520 --> 31:00.020
And though exposed,
it is of my own choosing.

31:00.060 --> 31:03.070
- Tell them to put down
their guns and join us.

31:04.060 --> 31:05.490
Tell them

31:05.530 --> 31:07.160
or you die.

31:07.200 --> 31:10.040
- Then you get nothing.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.500
Why don't you try
and convince them?

31:16.640 --> 31:18.570
- Soldiers of Ev,

31:18.610 --> 31:22.010
we can fight together

31:22.050 --> 31:24.220
or we can die apart.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.750
And the first death

31:27.790 --> 31:31.700
will be the most tragic
and unnecessary death

31:31.720 --> 31:33.520
of your Queen

31:33.560 --> 31:36.230
if you don't put down
your weapons.

31:38.500 --> 31:39.740
- Madame Queen?

31:39.770 --> 31:42.070
What is your wish?

31:42.100 --> 31:44.700
- Last chance
to save your life.

31:50.210 --> 31:53.050
- Let us be...

31:53.080 --> 31:55.520
an example.

31:55.550 --> 31:58.090
My life is worth nothing

31:58.120 --> 32:01.530
unless you stand with me
against this man.

32:01.550 --> 32:03.450
Never surrender your weapons!

32:03.490 --> 32:05.100
- Oh, you put them down!

32:05.120 --> 32:08.720
You put your guns down
or your Queen is lost!

32:08.760 --> 32:09.790
Do you understand?

32:09.830 --> 32:11.740
If you make me kill her,

32:11.760 --> 32:14.100
you all die.

32:16.170 --> 32:17.810
- It's okay.

32:20.240 --> 32:22.250
Let me go.

32:32.550 --> 32:33.510
- No.

32:39.890 --> 32:41.260
- Stop him!

33:00.680 --> 33:03.120
- I'm here.
I'm here.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.620
Ojo!

34:21.929 --> 34:23.600
- Jane!

34:23.630 --> 34:26.370
Jane, she's been shot.
You have to do something.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.239
You have to help her!

34:29.370 --> 34:30.670
Fix her!

34:30.699 --> 34:32.500
You have to do something!
Please, fix her!

34:32.540 --> 34:35.710
Fix her like you fixed me.

34:35.739 --> 34:37.870
Please!

34:41.380 --> 34:42.480
She can't die!

34:42.510 --> 34:45.210
Do for her what you did for me.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.409
- You were alive
when we found you.

34:47.449 --> 34:49.179
- So is she!

34:50.520 --> 34:51.889
So is she!

34:51.920 --> 34:53.719
- No, Jack...

34:53.760 --> 34:56.500
No!
- So is she!

34:56.530 --> 34:58.540
- Jack!

35:04.670 --> 35:06.270
- Because we are fair,

35:06.310 --> 35:08.310
you will hear
the charges against you

35:08.340 --> 35:09.670
before you are sentenced.

35:09.710 --> 35:13.320
More than your apostate
of a sister did for us.

35:13.350 --> 35:15.690
You and your Cardinal sisters

35:15.710 --> 35:18.710
are to blame for the end
of our kind.

35:18.750 --> 35:21.320
- She stands against
her sisters.

35:21.350 --> 35:24.720
It was Mistress East
who locked you in the prison.

35:24.760 --> 35:28.430
- But Mistress West
sold the soul of our world

35:28.460 --> 35:30.290
for her own escape,

35:30.330 --> 35:32.440
to forget her pain.

35:32.460 --> 35:35.530
- She was weak,
as we all are.

35:35.570 --> 35:38.740
- She set herself apart from us,
denied us our place.

35:38.770 --> 35:42.340
Now she will pay
for the sins of her sisters,

35:42.370 --> 35:44.970
those here and gone.

36:05.360 --> 36:08.300
- Help your sister to her feet.

36:08.330 --> 36:12.000
- Shapeshifting
and sound waves.

36:12.040 --> 36:14.450
Both base magics.

36:31.060 --> 36:32.630
- It's going to be okay.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.330
Everything's going to be okay.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.410
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

37:08.690 --> 37:11.630
- This magic can't be tricked.

37:11.660 --> 37:13.530
You are true.

37:14.670 --> 37:17.770
We honor King Pastoria

37:17.800 --> 37:19.830
and his daughter.

37:21.110 --> 37:24.550
- Mistress West
freed your hides.

37:24.580 --> 37:29.390
She stands against those who
truly act again the sisterhood.

37:29.420 --> 37:33.390
So help her to her feet.

37:33.420 --> 37:36.560
The Wizard has oppressed the
magic that is your birthright...

37:36.590 --> 37:39.660
Its seeds sown into
the fabric of this land.

37:39.690 --> 37:42.660
No one can take that away
from you.

37:42.690 --> 37:45.460
Fight with me to rise again.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.770
To Emerald City.

37:54.570 --> 37:57.500
- How many masks
did you make her?

37:57.540 --> 37:59.140
- Jack...
- How many?

37:59.180 --> 38:00.920
- Hundreds.

38:01.910 --> 38:05.550
One for sadness.

38:05.580 --> 38:07.610
For joy.

38:07.650 --> 38:09.720
One for rage.

38:10.790 --> 38:12.600
For longing.

38:13.930 --> 38:15.830
One for love.

38:18.830 --> 38:22.460
She tried to love you, Jack,
as best she could.

38:23.500 --> 38:24.830
- Did you make one for this?

38:24.870 --> 38:27.770
For death?

38:27.810 --> 38:29.410
- No.

38:30.510 --> 38:32.880
- I killed her, Jane.
- No.

38:32.910 --> 38:35.740
- This is all my fault.
- You didn't kill her.

38:35.780 --> 38:37.610
- I shot her!

38:37.650 --> 38:39.460
I killed her!

38:46.160 --> 38:47.730
Many years ago,

38:47.760 --> 38:50.970
The Beast Forever
destroyed this kingdom.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.470
- Jane.

38:53.770 --> 38:56.210
- Slaughtered the Royal Family.

38:56.230 --> 38:59.770
- What are you doing?

38:59.810 --> 39:03.580
- The Queen...

39:03.610 --> 39:05.620
her sons...

39:08.010 --> 39:10.540
her daughter.

39:10.580 --> 39:11.950
- And what of him?

39:11.980 --> 39:14.920
- Only the King survived.

39:17.520 --> 39:18.820
- I don't understand.

39:18.860 --> 39:21.900
- You didn't kill her, Jack.

39:21.930 --> 39:25.740
Because she was already dead.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.570
- I salvaged what remained.

39:35.610 --> 39:38.520
The rest, I rebuilt.

39:38.540 --> 39:41.980
I made her masks to hide a face
that never aged.

39:42.010 --> 39:44.910
It was a secret
the King swore me to keep.

39:44.950 --> 39:48.820
He couldn't lose her,
and you don't have to either.

39:48.850 --> 39:50.520
I can repair her.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.760
- You let me believe
she was real!

39:53.790 --> 39:55.520
That I was real!

39:55.560 --> 39:58.630
- You are.
- No, I'm not!

39:58.660 --> 40:00.790
I'm nothing but tin, like her.

40:00.830 --> 40:03.830
- No!
- This body, these parts...

40:03.870 --> 40:04.910
- No.

40:06.300 --> 40:09.740
- I might as well
put them to good use.

40:09.780 --> 40:11.820
- Where are you going?

40:13.710 --> 40:15.210
- To cut down The Wizard.

40:15.250 --> 40:16.690
- His soldiers will kill you.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.220
- They can't!

40:18.250 --> 40:21.220
I'm already dead.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.520
- Jack! Wait!

40:50.950 --> 40:52.760
- Positions!

40:53.850 --> 40:55.720
Aim.
- No!

40:56.820 --> 40:59.290
Please.
