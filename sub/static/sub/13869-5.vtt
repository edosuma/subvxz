WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:02.711
MITCH: A year ago,
the animals started acting strangely,

00:02.735 --> 00:04.172
but no one noticed...

00:04.205 --> 00:05.239
(growling)

00:05.273 --> 00:06.416
until they began attacking,

00:06.440 --> 00:08.176
coordinating,

00:08.209 --> 00:09.210
evolving.

00:09.243 --> 00:11.112
The animals were mutating,

00:11.145 --> 00:12.756
and it was happening faster
than anyone expected.

00:12.780 --> 00:13.647
(screaming)

00:13.681 --> 00:16.216
The government came
up with a plan.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.327
PSA NARRATOR: Thanks
to the Noah Objective,

00:17.351 --> 00:20.088
in six to ten years,
the world's animal population

00:20.121 --> 00:22.390
will be thriving once again.

00:22.423 --> 00:25.459
Killing the animals?
Play God and repopulate the planet?

00:25.493 --> 00:26.694
This is ridiculous.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.429
MITCH: But messing
with Mother Nature

00:28.462 --> 00:30.231
could be catastrophic,

00:30.264 --> 00:32.076
so a group of us are
trying to save the animals.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.302
Jackson Oz and Abraham Kenyatta,

00:34.335 --> 00:36.104
animal experts.

00:36.137 --> 00:38.639
Chloe Tousignant,
an intel operative.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.408
Jamie Campbell,

00:40.441 --> 00:43.177
a reporter who's been
following this story, found me,

00:43.211 --> 00:46.380
Mitch Morgan,
a veterinary pathologist.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.783
Together,
we're going to find a cure

00:49.817 --> 00:51.085
for the animals.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.321
Time is running out.

00:54.355 --> 00:55.689
Previously on Zoo...

00:55.723 --> 00:58.292
I compared your blood
to our one-armed friend.

00:58.326 --> 00:59.336
You have the same mutilation.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.262
If I can save you,

01:01.295 --> 01:02.663
I can save the animals.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.831
I'm a dead man.
And so are you if they find out

01:04.864 --> 01:05.966
that we burned their money.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.402
MASON: You have something
that belongs to us.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.537
Where's my money?

01:09.570 --> 01:10.238
(Jamie whimpers)

01:10.271 --> 01:11.739
(slicing sound, Jamie grunts)

01:11.772 --> 01:13.607
(Mason groans)

01:16.644 --> 01:19.180
CHLOE: This is how many animals
they expect to eliminate

01:19.213 --> 01:20.481
with the Noah Objective.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.416
So General Davies knows
his big animal solution

01:22.450 --> 01:24.418
will also kill
millions of people.

01:24.452 --> 01:25.319
JACKSON: Best chance
we have to stop him

01:25.353 --> 01:26.887
is inside the walls
of Reiden Global.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.489
Our nations are facing

01:28.522 --> 01:29.890
a dark time.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.260
We must stop these animals.

01:32.293 --> 01:33.327
CHLOE: That's the poison.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.571
There will be nothing to vote on

01:34.595 --> 01:36.430
if they can't do
the demonstration.

01:36.464 --> 01:37.665
DARIELA: Let's go!

01:37.698 --> 01:39.400
It's been hit. Run!

01:45.306 --> 01:47.675
Jamie, she's in Caraquet.

01:47.708 --> 01:48.776
Chloe!

01:51.845 --> 01:53.514
Chloe! (alarm blaring)

01:53.547 --> 01:55.816
Damn it.

02:24.712 --> 02:25.713
Grab her. Come here.

02:25.746 --> 02:27.681
Come here, Chloe. Oh, my God.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.550
Straighten out her legs.
Okay, Chloe?

02:29.583 --> 02:30.594
(grunts) JACKSON: You're okay.
You're okay.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.286
Okay? Shh. Chloe?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.421
Hey, hey.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.922
Here we go.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.224
(Mitch grunting) Come on.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.559
Come on. Breathe. Come on.

JACKSON: Come on, babe.
Stay with me.

Oh! Chloe!

Oh, thank God.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.236
(door opens) SOLDIER: Come on.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.870
This way. Corridor B.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.439
Davies.
We got to get her out of here.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.940
Okay. Let's go.

02:58.479 --> 03:00.490
RADIO NEWSCASTER: Antibiotics
remain in short supply

03:00.514 --> 03:01.882
throughout the European Union

03:01.915 --> 03:03.517
as the animal
uprising continues.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.352
I don't understand.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.487
Why aren't they
saying anything about

03:06.520 --> 03:07.621
the leopard or the cure?

03:07.655 --> 03:08.689
Jamie... Just hold on.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.367
The ongoing border dispute...
(radio turns off)

03:10.391 --> 03:11.625
Hey!

03:11.659 --> 03:12.736
Just let me get this out, okay?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.671
You don't have to...
Jamie, I almost got you killed.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.330
I'm glad

03:16.364 --> 03:17.465
that Mason's dead.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.400
You did what you had to
do, but...

03:19.433 --> 03:21.735
what happened back
there, that's on me.

03:21.769 --> 03:23.337
Sorry that I got you

03:23.371 --> 03:24.605
mixed up in all of this.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.574
Doesn't matter,
let's just get to Caraquet.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.709
Find a phone so I
can call my friends.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.813
(engine sputters)

03:32.846 --> 03:34.315
Why are you slowing down?

03:34.348 --> 03:35.316
I'm not.

03:35.349 --> 03:36.484
Something's wrong.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.686
(engine sputters, turns off)

03:44.758 --> 03:46.394
Do you know what you're doing?

03:46.427 --> 03:47.561
Yeah, I rebuilt my first

03:47.595 --> 03:48.996
carburetor when I was ten.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.030
No!

03:50.063 --> 03:52.333
I know, it's hard to
believe I'm actually good

03:52.366 --> 03:53.734
for something, but... No, look.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.772
This is not possible.

04:00.874 --> 04:01.742
Is that...

04:01.775 --> 04:03.544
Caraquet.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.817
You're fine.
You got this, you're doing great.

04:09.850 --> 04:10.918
You're good.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.322
Trotter's preparing for takeoff.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.632
He said someone's been
trying to contact us

04:15.656 --> 04:16.857
on the plane's secure channel.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.926
Don't answer.
Secure or not, we can't risk

04:18.959 --> 04:20.003
letting Davies
know where we are.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.394
(panting): Leave.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.229
What?

04:22.262 --> 04:23.797
Get her out of here, Abe.
Rafiki...

04:23.831 --> 04:25.366
Get her out of here, Abe!

04:27.635 --> 04:28.636
Come on.

04:28.669 --> 04:30.938
Let's go help Trotter.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.540
JACKSON: Yeah, come on, yeah.

04:32.573 --> 04:33.674
You're doing great.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.479
Come on, come on,
you're all right.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.847
What is that? Adrenaline.

04:41.715 --> 04:42.750
(grunts)

04:42.783 --> 04:44.385
Yeah.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.419
She's okay.

04:45.453 --> 04:46.887
She's okay. You got it.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.390
What's going on?

04:49.423 --> 04:50.624
(weakly): Jamie...

04:50.658 --> 04:51.801
Did you find Jamie?
Do you know...

04:51.825 --> 04:52.836
Do you know where she's at?

04:52.860 --> 04:55.763
Caraquet.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.431
Cara... Caraquet.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.766
Jamie's in Caraquet?

05:00.768 --> 05:01.769
(gasps)

05:06.774 --> 05:07.875
Cour... Courier...

05:07.908 --> 05:08.976
Courier?

05:09.009 --> 05:09.977
What's a "courier," baby?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.779
What do you mean "courier?"

05:12.546 --> 05:15.449

05:15.483 --> 05:16.884

05:19.420 --> 05:20.621
No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.489
Come on.

05:21.522 --> 05:22.456
Stay with me, No,
you were doing good.

05:22.490 --> 05:24.758
You were doing good.
You're right here, right?

05:24.792 --> 05:26.527
You're right here.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.729
Mitch, give her another shot.
I can't.

05:28.762 --> 05:29.430
Her body can't take it.

05:29.463 --> 05:30.197
Then give her something else.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.466
(stammers) Give her something!

05:32.500 --> 05:33.743
There's nothing I can do!
Come on.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.469
Come on, baby,
you're doing great.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.904
Hey. But you...

05:36.937 --> 05:37.905
Hey! You had it.

05:37.938 --> 05:38.639
You had it.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.773
Hey.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.652
You're gonna be fine, sweetie.

06:03.931 --> 06:05.933
♪

06:36.797 --> 06:38.732
So the fuel gauge is busted.

06:38.766 --> 06:39.976
We've probably been
running on fumes

06:40.000 --> 06:41.635
for the last 30 miles.
(car door opens)

06:45.873 --> 06:47.508
What are you doing?

06:47.541 --> 06:48.752
I'm walking.
Look, I'm as optimistic

06:48.776 --> 06:50.778
as the next guy,
but you saw what I saw.

06:50.811 --> 06:51.912
There's nothing left.

06:51.945 --> 06:53.146
Caraquet's gone.

(sniffling)

07:50.638 --> 07:51.905
What?

07:58.746 --> 08:00.714
I just... (sighs)

08:02.716 --> 08:03.817
I just wanted to say

08:03.851 --> 08:05.953
how sorry I am.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.221
Tell me what happened.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.059
Tell me.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.830
One of Davies' men
shot the gas canister.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.166
(voice breaking): It was
leaking, so we ran.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.302
I thought Chloe was
right behind me.

08:22.335 --> 08:25.606
But there wasn't enough
time, and then the gas, it...

08:25.639 --> 08:26.940
it was spreading, so I...

08:26.974 --> 08:28.742
(sighs)

08:32.946 --> 08:33.881
I had to.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.883
You had to what? Jackson...

08:35.916 --> 08:36.950
Tell me.

08:36.984 --> 08:37.885
What'd you have to do?

08:37.918 --> 08:39.086
What did you have to do?

08:39.119 --> 08:40.854
I had to shut the door.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.892
I had to shut the door,
there was no other choice.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.827
Couldn't have waited
three seconds?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.271
I didn't have three seconds.
You weren't there.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.898
I had to make a
decision or all of us,

08:50.931 --> 08:53.601
everyone at the reception,
we'd all be lined up beside her.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.268
So you say.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.715
LOGAN: How's your foot?

09:07.748 --> 09:08.716

What is that?

09:20.227 --> 09:21.605
(roaring continues,
leaves rustling)

09:21.629 --> 09:23.130
Run.

09:27.000 --> 09:27.935
What is that thing?

09:27.968 --> 09:28.936
I don't know.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.037
Let's not find out.

This isn't happening.

10:14.081 --> 10:16.817
Jackson... No, uh, it-it's...
none of it.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.952
It can't be. I'm...

10:18.986 --> 10:19.987
imagining it.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.922
I'm imagining all of it. I'm...

10:23.256 --> 10:25.058
She was trying to tell
me something, Abe.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.760
What do you mean?

10:26.794 --> 10:28.061
Before she died,

10:28.095 --> 10:29.997
she was trying to
tell me something

10:30.030 --> 10:31.899
about "The Courier."

10:31.932 --> 10:33.967
What is "The Courier"?

10:34.001 --> 10:34.968
I don't know,

10:35.002 --> 10:36.012
but it was important to her.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.238

10:38.271 --> 10:39.873
Oh... What the hell's that?

10:39.907 --> 10:41.074
Trotter.

10:41.108 --> 10:42.910
Trotter!
(over intercom): It's not me.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.277
Someone else is
flying the plane.

10:44.311 --> 10:45.713
What...

10:45.746 --> 10:46.714
what does that mean,

10:46.747 --> 10:47.891
somebody else is
flying the plane?

10:47.915 --> 10:48.882
It must be Davies.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.918
MITCH: Well, how?
He must have hacked our plane.

10:50.951 --> 10:52.920
(clunk, whirring)

10:52.953 --> 10:55.055
That's the landing
gear coming down.

10:55.088 --> 10:56.356
TROTTER: Everyone strap in.

10:56.389 --> 10:58.025
We're landing,
whether we like it or not.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.267
(indistinct chatter)

11:12.039 --> 11:13.006
(Jamie coughs)

11:13.040 --> 11:14.842
(coughing)

11:14.875 --> 11:16.075
What were you doing out there?

11:18.311 --> 11:19.980
Trying to stay alive.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.481
What the hell's
outside the fence?

11:21.514 --> 11:22.950
Where did you come from?

11:22.983 --> 11:25.152
About 40 kilometers south.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.754
Is anyone else with you?

11:28.055 --> 11:29.065
What's up with
the interrogation?

11:29.089 --> 11:32.159
You want to take the bass
out of your voice, son,

11:32.192 --> 11:33.794
or have me knock it out?
JAMIE: Whoa.

11:33.827 --> 11:34.895
What happened to Caraquet?

11:34.928 --> 11:36.329
The fires.
Did the animals do that?

11:37.297 --> 11:39.299
No.

11:41.001 --> 11:42.803
We did.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.374
There's nobody out there.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.484
We're almost at the
end of the runway.

11:48.508 --> 11:49.476
I don't see anything. No.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.011
(Dariela exhales)

11:51.044 --> 11:52.079
Stuff this in your ears

11:52.112 --> 11:53.013
and cover your eyes
when they breach.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.082
Why? Flashbangs.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.993
Two through the door.
Then they come in shooting.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.985
That's what I would do.

11:58.018 --> 11:59.152
Flank the door.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.187
Get behind cover now.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.225
(rifle clicks)

12:11.198 --> 12:12.976
Hit 'em as soon as they
come through that door.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.101
Don't let 'em hit first.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.203
Hold your fire.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.404
Please don't shoot.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.176
That goes double for you.

12:25.178 --> 12:26.379
Who the hell are you?

12:26.413 --> 12:27.347
This could've all
been much simpler

12:27.380 --> 12:29.158
if you'd just picked up
on the secure channel.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.317
We installed

12:30.350 --> 12:31.985
an emergency
override just in case

12:32.019 --> 12:34.054
I ever needed to take
remote control of my plane.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.022
Your plane?

12:35.055 --> 12:36.123
Yes. Mine.

12:39.026 --> 12:40.127
Hello, Mitch.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.864
Allison.

12:43.897 --> 12:45.833
You two know each other?

12:48.301 --> 12:49.502
She's my stepmom.

12:56.910 --> 12:58.111
I'm Gwen.

12:58.145 --> 13:00.113
You'll have to excuse Curtis.

13:00.147 --> 13:01.581
We don't get many visitors.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.217
Well, what happened here?

13:04.251 --> 13:07.287
Well, Caraquet was
overrun five months ago.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.489
By the time the
military arrived,

13:09.522 --> 13:12.459
we'd lost hundreds of people.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.062
They planned to evacuate
us in three weeks.

13:15.095 --> 13:18.365
The first wave included
the injured and infirm.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.467
But the soldiers
never came back.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.136
Word is, they all went home

13:23.170 --> 13:25.572
to save their kin and
head for the hills.

13:27.340 --> 13:28.620
We've been on our
own ever since.

13:30.177 --> 13:32.279
What about the
fires and the smoke?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.881
That's to keep the animals away.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.949
We burn around the clock.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.951
We ran into something out there.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.152
Something big.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.188
To be honest,

13:41.221 --> 13:42.990
most of us haven't
been outside in months.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.225
LOGAN: How do you get
food and supplies?

13:45.258 --> 13:47.360
The school was the town's
emergency relief center.

13:47.394 --> 13:49.462
Lucky for us,
it was stocked before the attacks.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.198
So do you have a sat phone?
Or a radio?

13:51.231 --> 13:52.532
We don't.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.600
Sorry.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.442
We have a doctor.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.344
Urologist, but, uh,
I'll have him come by

14:04.377 --> 14:05.521
and take a look at your foot.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.379
Oh, thank you.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.881
But first,

14:07.915 --> 14:09.516
get changed.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.084
You will feel better

14:11.118 --> 14:13.420
with some clean
clothes and a shower.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.055
You have running water?

14:15.088 --> 14:17.590
And a temperamental
water heater.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.592
But the good news
is, you're safe.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.229
Welcome to Caraquet.

14:22.262 --> 14:24.164
Let's just start over, shall we?

14:24.197 --> 14:25.933
My name is Allison Shaw.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.468
I'm the Deputy Secretary
of Defense and, yes,

14:28.501 --> 14:30.503
I was married to Mitch's father.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.275
Somebody else want to talk now?
JACKSON: I do.

14:35.308 --> 14:36.953
We've been flying around
on your stepmother's plane

14:36.977 --> 14:38.154
and you didn't think to tell us?

14:38.178 --> 14:39.947
Keeping secrets like this...

14:39.980 --> 14:41.548
Mitch had no idea.
I made sure of it.

14:41.581 --> 14:42.615
We haven't spoken in...

14:42.649 --> 14:43.951
12 years.

14:43.984 --> 14:44.952
12 years.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.253
So why now,

14:46.286 --> 14:47.354
Allison?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.455
What do you want with us?

14:48.488 --> 14:49.656
Why'd you bring us here?

14:49.689 --> 14:51.424
With Amelia gone
and Eleanor gone,

14:51.458 --> 14:52.692
there's fewer of us left.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.027
We need to work together.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.028
We have to.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.363
My family owns

14:56.396 --> 14:58.331
the largest orchard
on the West Coast,

14:58.365 --> 14:59.666
and our trees are all dying.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.568
I need your help to stop it.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.004
You just said that you
work for the Pentagon,

15:04.037 --> 15:05.505
so why would you need our help?

15:05.538 --> 15:07.707
Because the government can't
know anything about this.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.541
If Davies finds out

15:08.575 --> 15:10.577
that our food source
is threatened,

15:10.610 --> 15:12.645
he'll use it to leverage
additional resources

15:12.679 --> 15:14.181
to the Noah Objective.

15:14.214 --> 15:16.049
You're the only ones
that I can trust.

15:17.617 --> 15:18.651
So...

15:19.752 --> 15:20.720
Chloe's dead.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.489
Jamie's in some Canadian...

15:22.522 --> 15:24.391
Wait, Chloe's... Chloe's dead?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.062
What happened?

15:31.531 --> 15:36.269
We disrupted General Davies'
event in Vancouver and...

15:36.303 --> 15:38.071
I'm sorry. JACKSON: Can you just

15:38.105 --> 15:39.372
back that up for a second?

15:39.406 --> 15:41.074
You knew Chloe?

15:41.108 --> 15:42.475
She and Eleanor
were the only ones

15:42.509 --> 15:43.686
who knew that I was
behind your team.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.278
I've been secretly working

15:45.312 --> 15:46.346
against Davies,

15:46.379 --> 15:47.523
trying to find an alternative

15:47.547 --> 15:48.548
to the Noah Objective.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.284
Well, then, let us go find
that alternative, okay?

15:51.318 --> 15:52.619
Because that's
what Chloe wanted.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.021
ALLISON: Please.

15:54.054 --> 15:55.431
I need you to come
with me to my orchard.

15:55.455 --> 15:58.758
You know, we're not gonna
go anywhere with you.

15:58.791 --> 16:00.460
You can keep your stupid plane.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.305
We'll find another way to
get Jamie and find a cure.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.663
What he said.

16:06.433 --> 16:08.301
Did Chloe ever
mention "The Courier"?

16:10.137 --> 16:11.638
JACKSON: Yeah.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.972
Yeah, she did, right...

16:14.741 --> 16:16.043
What the hell do you know?

16:16.076 --> 16:17.677
You save my family's orchard,

16:17.710 --> 16:19.646
and this plane is
yours, no strings.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.382
And I'll tell you everything.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.686
(indistinct chatter)

16:34.294 --> 16:35.262
Hey.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.663
Hey.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.631
How was the shower?

16:38.665 --> 16:39.799
Uh, freezing.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.568
And wonderful. (Laughs)

16:43.503 --> 16:45.638
You're skinnier
than I'd imagined.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.375
(chuckles) 'Cause of the parka.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.652
It's, like,
three sizes too big for you.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.712
Not that I was
imagining anything...

16:54.481 --> 16:57.084
I'm gonna stop talking.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.585
(laughs)

16:58.618 --> 16:59.586
MAN: Hey.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.054
Where did you get that?

17:01.088 --> 17:02.089
Excuse me?

17:03.656 --> 17:06.226
That sweatshirt.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.227
Why do you have it?

17:07.260 --> 17:08.261
Easy, man.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.296
It's not yours.

17:09.329 --> 17:11.631
Uh, well, Gwen gave it to me...

17:11.664 --> 17:13.266
Is there a problem here?

17:13.300 --> 17:15.502
Yeah, this guy's hassling Jamie

17:15.535 --> 17:17.270
about the sweatshirt
that you gave her.

17:17.304 --> 17:18.637
Is that true, David?

17:21.840 --> 17:23.843
I-I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.212
I... My bad.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.750
What's his problem?

17:30.783 --> 17:33.420
We've been here a long time.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.323
Some have adjusted
better than others.

17:47.134 --> 17:48.244
ALLISON: This time
of the season,

17:48.268 --> 17:50.170
these branches should
be heavy with fruit,

17:50.203 --> 17:51.171
but everything's stunted.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.439
It's stopped growing.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.849
It's the same story
all over the area.

17:53.873 --> 17:55.408
And it's spreading.

17:57.210 --> 17:58.445
Look at this stuff.

18:04.384 --> 18:07.220
What are you?

18:07.254 --> 18:08.355
It looks like glass to me,

18:08.388 --> 18:10.323
so that's what we've
been calling it.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.524
It poisons the trees.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.460
Soaks in through the roots.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.737
It's in the soil throughout
the entire property.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.296
MAN: I've been working here

18:16.329 --> 18:19.299
half my life and I've never
seen anything like it.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.368
At this rate, we won't produce

18:21.401 --> 18:22.411
a tenth of our normal yield.

18:22.435 --> 18:23.603
Damn.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.238
ALLISON: With no one
eating meat anymore,

18:25.272 --> 18:26.315
fruit is more
important than ever.

18:26.339 --> 18:28.441
If this continues to spread,

18:28.475 --> 18:30.910
hundreds of thousands
of people will starve.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.313
And you think that an
animal is behind this glass?

18:33.346 --> 18:35.282
Well, it's not plant-based.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.217
And given your work
connecting mutated animals

18:37.250 --> 18:38.385
to environmental events...

18:39.686 --> 18:41.554
If there is a connection,
we'll find it.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.256
(zips bag closed)

18:43.290 --> 18:44.824
Then we can get the
hell out of here.

18:47.860 --> 18:50.463
(insects trilling)

18:50.497 --> 18:52.499
(slithering)

19:00.673 --> 19:02.675
(wet slithering)

19:03.676 --> 19:05.678
(coughs, grunting)

19:10.617 --> 19:12.319
Oh, Bill!

19:12.352 --> 19:13.420
Bill!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.490
Well, it's not glass.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.758
Thought that part was obvious.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.360
Right.

19:20.393 --> 19:23.330
But bet you wouldn't have
guessed it's organic.

19:23.363 --> 19:25.365
Cellular structure's

19:25.398 --> 19:27.367
a lot like skin... with, uh,

19:27.400 --> 19:28.668
traces of toxic residue

19:28.701 --> 19:30.470
that are definitely
animal-based.

19:30.503 --> 19:31.947
Well, what animal do
you think it's from?

19:31.971 --> 19:33.240
I don't know yet.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.283
But if we're gonna
make it to Caraquet,

19:34.307 --> 19:35.418
I better figure that out quick.

19:35.442 --> 19:36.443
Right?

19:40.947 --> 19:42.715
Oh.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.517
You're not here to
talk about toxic glass,

19:44.551 --> 19:46.453
are you?

19:46.486 --> 19:47.320
All right, look.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.221
If you want to talk
about Allison...

19:48.255 --> 19:50.223
Last night,
when I was saying good-bye

19:50.257 --> 19:51.891
to Chloe, um...

19:51.924 --> 19:52.892
I started crying...

19:52.925 --> 19:54.861
Yeah. Well...

19:54.894 --> 19:56.296
black tears.

19:56.329 --> 19:57.630
They were thick,

19:57.664 --> 19:59.466
almost like oil.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.633
Anybody see this?

20:00.667 --> 20:01.667
No.

20:02.869 --> 20:05.272
You're displaying the same
symptomology as Kovacs.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.906
Right before he escaped,

20:06.939 --> 20:08.384
I saw the same thing.
It was black tears.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.277
So what does that mean,
that I'm progressing?

20:10.310 --> 20:12.445
I'm one step closer to him?

20:13.480 --> 20:15.448
Okay, I get it. It's your plane.

20:15.482 --> 20:16.449
You've got to learn to knock.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.550
Not now, Mitch.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.419
Please, it's Bill.
You have to help him.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.492
(gagging) BILL'S
WIFE: He's in here.

20:25.525 --> 20:26.793
What's wrong with him?

20:26.826 --> 20:28.961
(groans loudly) Help him!

20:28.995 --> 20:31.398
Bill, hey. Look at me.
Can you speak?

20:31.431 --> 20:33.333
Try Dr. Miller again.
Hurry. (Bill groaning)

20:33.366 --> 20:34.667
Can you speak?

20:34.701 --> 20:35.468
No.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.003
JACKSON: Whoa!

20:37.036 --> 20:38.004
ALLISON: Bill?

20:38.037 --> 20:40.273
(gagging, groaning)

20:41.674 --> 20:43.034
Is that the stuff
from the orchard?

20:43.710 --> 20:44.811
Bill?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.613
(groaning)

20:47.547 --> 20:50.450
(hissing)

20:50.483 --> 20:51.751
ALLISON: Mitch?

20:51.784 --> 20:52.785
Help him, for God's sake!

20:52.819 --> 20:53.853
We gotta pull it out.

20:53.886 --> 20:54.886
Hold him.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.924
We got to pull it out!
Go, grab it!

20:57.957 --> 20:59.459
God!

21:05.632 --> 21:06.633
(groaning)

21:11.471 --> 21:12.605
(snake hissing)

21:20.713 --> 21:22.048
Bill? (wheezing)

21:22.081 --> 21:23.282
Bill?

21:36.729 --> 21:38.998
I keep seeing her face
through the glass.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.575
When I turned back,
Chloe wasn't behind me.

21:48.608 --> 21:51.644
Just a wall of gas.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.080
I didn't want to
close that door.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.314
But I did.

21:57.850 --> 22:00.019
And then her face was there.

22:07.760 --> 22:08.728
I'm sorry.

22:08.761 --> 22:09.896
But when I look at you now,

22:09.929 --> 22:12.865
all I see is the fact that
Chloe is no longer with us.

22:14.133 --> 22:16.503
And I have to live with that.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.577
You get the feeling like
we're the new kids in school?

22:24.611 --> 22:26.513
JAMIE: Yeah,
except all the teachers are freaks

22:26.546 --> 22:27.980
and the students are weirdos.

22:29.982 --> 22:30.950
I'd stay away

22:30.983 --> 22:32.419
from the mashed potatoes.

22:32.452 --> 22:33.786
Uh, they look good to me.

22:33.820 --> 22:35.121
Looks can be deceiving.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.091
They-they make
'em with rutabaga.

22:39.125 --> 22:40.126
There's a lot of

22:40.159 --> 22:41.861
rutabaga up here.

22:41.894 --> 22:43.630
Um...

22:47.033 --> 22:48.435
JAMIE: Ooh. WOMAN: Oh...

22:48.468 --> 22:50.069
crap, I'm so sorry.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.904
Don't worry about it.

22:51.938 --> 22:53.039
Run.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.707
What?

22:54.741 --> 22:56.676
First chance you get, run.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.445
CURTIS: Maddie.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.812
What happened here?

22:59.846 --> 23:01.147
Clumsy me.

23:01.180 --> 23:02.649
I, uh...

23:02.682 --> 23:05.151
I swear my hands are
still numb from the cold.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.055
Can you get Jamie another plate?

23:09.088 --> 23:10.690
Sure thing, Curtis.

23:13.893 --> 23:14.893
Clean this up, will you?

23:17.697 --> 23:19.398
Sorry.

23:21.668 --> 23:24.471
At least now we know
it's poisoning the trees.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.173
That stuff he threw
up, the glass,

23:27.206 --> 23:28.808
same stuff we saw
in the orchard.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.543
Snake shed it like

23:30.577 --> 23:31.544
molted skin.

23:31.578 --> 23:34.013
Given the amount of glass
we saw in the orchard,

23:34.046 --> 23:35.648
there must be
thousands of snakes.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.416
So where are all
the snakes hiding?

23:40.052 --> 23:41.721
Snake came in through the
toilet, right?

23:41.754 --> 23:43.089
It certainly looks like it.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.791
I think I got an idea.

23:44.824 --> 23:48.861
This is the aquifer that runs
underneath your property.

23:48.895 --> 23:49.862
It supplies water to

23:49.896 --> 23:51.964
all the farms in the county.
My thought is that

23:51.998 --> 23:54.033
the snakes are shedding
their toxic glass

23:54.066 --> 23:55.635
directly into your
farm's water supply.

23:55.668 --> 23:57.980
What about the drinking water? The county
draws it from the river, so at least

23:58.004 --> 23:58.805
we don't have to worry about

23:58.838 --> 24:00.940
contamination. But we do.
Your aquifer

24:00.973 --> 24:04.477
feeds into tons of other
public water sources

24:04.511 --> 24:05.845
for hundreds of miles.

24:05.878 --> 24:07.213
Your farm is only the beginning.

24:07.246 --> 24:09.982
So these snakes,
they're going to poison the entire.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.918
Pacific Northwest.
JACKSON: Countless

24:11.951 --> 24:14.687
innocent people are
gonna be drinking poison

24:14.721 --> 24:16.899
directly from their kitchen
sinks unless we do something.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.157
So how do we stop it?

24:18.190 --> 24:20.059
Poison them.

24:20.092 --> 24:22.028
Before they poison us.

24:27.734 --> 24:30.036
Hey.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.838
You shouldn't be back here.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.573
Why did you tell us to run?

24:33.606 --> 24:35.646
'Cause you're gonna end up
outside the fence anyway.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.678
Might as well have a chance.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.246
What are you talking about?

24:40.279 --> 24:41.748
Tonight is another vote.

24:41.781 --> 24:42.615
Vote?

24:42.649 --> 24:44.150
Yeah.

24:44.183 --> 24:45.518
What are they voting on?

24:45.552 --> 24:46.919
The feeding.

24:46.953 --> 24:47.920
"The feeding?"

24:47.954 --> 24:50.156
What the hell is that?
GWEN: You'll find out

24:50.189 --> 24:51.791
soon enough.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.528
I'm disappointed, Maddie.

24:58.698 --> 24:59.666
No!

24:59.699 --> 25:01.100
Hey, hey. No. MADDIE: No!

25:01.133 --> 25:03.836
(men grunting)

25:03.870 --> 25:05.638
(grunting, clattering)

25:09.909 --> 25:12.679
(grunting continues)

25:19.686 --> 25:22.989
Glad to see you still
have some fight in you.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.023
You're gonna need it.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.294
Both of you.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.306
(rattling)

25:51.083 --> 25:55.622
Just tell me how it will work.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.789
I'd rather not.

25:58.324 --> 26:00.893
Mitch, you are using my lab

26:00.927 --> 26:03.062
to make a poison that
you want to dump into

26:03.095 --> 26:04.997
the water supply,
so just lose the misunderstood

26:05.031 --> 26:08.134
misanthrope act and tell
me how it will work,

26:08.167 --> 26:09.802
or I will shut it down.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.005
I've never known

26:13.039 --> 26:14.249
anybody who threatens
to take their

26:14.273 --> 26:16.943
ball away and go home
more than you do.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.144
Mom.

26:18.177 --> 26:20.088
I would've thought by now you
wouldn't let personal issues

26:20.112 --> 26:22.148
get in the way of, well,
saving the world. Personal?

26:22.181 --> 26:23.082
You made it personal.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.017
We were finally on our
way to go get Jamie.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.619
You come and yank
us out of the air.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.154
Damn it, Mitch,
I brought you here.

26:28.187 --> 26:30.790
I gave you this lab, this plane,

26:30.823 --> 26:33.025
because I believe in you.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.261
Eleanor sent me
dozens of alternatives

26:35.294 --> 26:36.763
to the Noah Objective.

26:36.796 --> 26:39.165
I passed on all of them
until I saw your name.

26:39.198 --> 26:43.069
All of this is because I
know you better than anyone.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.337
You're the best at what you
do, you just needed someone

26:45.371 --> 26:48.007
to back you up.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.242
So tell me,
did I bet on the right horse?

26:58.818 --> 26:59.819
(clears throat)

27:01.988 --> 27:04.056
The vomeronasal organ.

27:04.090 --> 27:07.126
Also known as Jacobson's organ.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.294
(sighs)

27:08.327 --> 27:10.897
It's a sort of...

27:10.930 --> 27:12.431
primitive olfactory receptor.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.066
It sits in front of the brain.

27:14.100 --> 27:15.340
When a snake flicks its tongue,

27:15.367 --> 27:17.203
it's gathering
particles to process

27:17.236 --> 27:19.706
through its Jacobson's organ.

27:19.739 --> 27:22.108
This formula,

27:22.141 --> 27:26.045
when ingested,
will cause that organ to swell.

27:26.078 --> 27:29.849
Till it presses
against the brain,

27:29.882 --> 27:32.418
shutting off all the snake's...

27:32.451 --> 27:33.385
bodily functions.

27:33.419 --> 27:36.756
How do we know that
it won't hurt humans?

27:42.962 --> 27:45.197
(sighs)

27:45.231 --> 27:46.298
(smacks lips) We good?

27:46.332 --> 27:47.499
Yeah.

27:47.533 --> 27:50.236
'Cause I got to make a whole
bunch of this stuff. Mm-hmm.

27:50.269 --> 27:51.269
(hissing, clattering)

27:54.907 --> 27:57.143
(hissing)

27:57.176 --> 27:58.277
ALLISON: Oh, my God.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.812
(hissing continues)

28:02.381 --> 28:05.151
(stammers) Uh...
we got a problem in here.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.253
Are you okay?

28:07.286 --> 28:08.487
(hissing, rattling)

28:08.520 --> 28:09.756
Oh.

28:09.789 --> 28:11.190
Uh, for the moment.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.459
Where's the poison?

28:13.492 --> 28:15.161
Einstein over here drank it.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.062
You did what?

28:16.095 --> 28:17.163
I was making a point.

28:18.330 --> 28:19.498
I'll get the tranqs.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.933
I got this.

28:20.967 --> 28:22.835
Jackson...

28:22.869 --> 28:27.139
Easy. Easy.

28:27.173 --> 28:28.307
(loud hiss)

28:35.281 --> 28:37.083
You sure you want to do this?

28:37.116 --> 28:38.717
Easy.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.755
ABRAHAM: Rafiki.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.472
My God.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.284
Rafiki, how did you...
We should talk.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.053
ALLISON: Give me the formula

29:14.086 --> 29:14.921
for the poison.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.331
I'll have my guy
start synthesizing it.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.290
And then we can
leave for Caraquet?

29:18.324 --> 29:20.192
Yes we can. "We?"

29:20.226 --> 29:22.128
You can explain on the way.

29:23.562 --> 29:26.332
Tomorrow another
feeding is upon us.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.167
So, tonight we vote.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.101
Why do we have to vote?

29:29.135 --> 29:31.570
Can't we just feed those
two to the animals?

29:31.603 --> 29:33.139
We all agreed to
abide by the vote.

29:33.172 --> 29:34.506
You don't have to do this.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.175
Help is coming.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.219
GWEN: I wish that were true.

29:37.243 --> 29:39.478
But we've all learned

29:39.511 --> 29:41.213
that we need to help ourselves.

29:41.247 --> 29:44.216
We guarantee the
safety of the many

29:44.250 --> 29:46.018
with the sacrifice of a few.

29:46.052 --> 29:47.529
Do you really think that
you've made some kind of deal

29:47.553 --> 29:49.021
with what's out there?

29:49.055 --> 29:50.890
We do.

29:50.923 --> 29:52.925
How else to explain
that we're still here?

29:52.959 --> 29:57.163
Since we began the feedings,
we've had no unexpected attacks.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.164
Which is why

29:58.197 --> 29:59.531
it must continue.

29:59.565 --> 30:01.033
Let's just vote, Gwen.

30:01.067 --> 30:02.168
Okay.

30:02.201 --> 30:03.269
Nominations.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.503
I nominate the girl.

30:04.536 --> 30:05.104
Jamie.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.505
LOGAN: Wait a minute.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.007
I'll go with Jamie.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.041
Any seconds?

30:09.075 --> 30:10.409
ALL: Aye.

30:10.442 --> 30:12.178
We need another.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.345
I nominate Maddie.

30:13.379 --> 30:14.380
JAMIE: No.

30:14.413 --> 30:16.348
She's just a child.

30:16.382 --> 30:18.126
Who's subject to the vote
like everyone else here.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.351
Any seconds?

30:19.385 --> 30:21.220
ALL: Aye. LOGAN: No!

30:21.253 --> 30:22.889
Just take me!

30:22.922 --> 30:24.023
No, that's okay.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.958
I'd rather be
eaten by wild goats

30:25.992 --> 30:27.393
then spend another second

30:27.426 --> 30:29.228
with you monsters. GWEN: Jamie

30:29.261 --> 30:30.196
and Maddie.

30:30.229 --> 30:31.230
All in favor.

30:31.263 --> 30:32.231
ALL: Aye.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.399
Opposed.

30:33.432 --> 30:35.367
You people, you're crazy!

30:35.401 --> 30:36.635
Enough.

30:36.668 --> 30:39.138
It's been decided.

30:39.171 --> 30:42.374
Tomorrow morning...

30:42.408 --> 30:44.343
this month's feeding
will commence.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.357
My mom used to teach here.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.362
Art.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.496
She was a total hippie.

31:04.530 --> 31:07.266
(chuckles, then sniffles)

31:07.299 --> 31:10.937
Always wanted to teach children
the beauty in the world.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.506
What happened to her?

31:14.540 --> 31:16.308
Instead, it was the animals.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.514
I'm sorry.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.650
(choked up): Yeah.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.526
It's probably better she
never saw any of this.

31:34.560 --> 31:37.029
There's nothing beautiful
left in Caraquet.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.297
Well, Caraquet... the world...

31:39.265 --> 31:42.568
Is not what it used to be.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.236
But you cannot give up.

31:44.270 --> 31:46.205
There's nothing we can do.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.440
The Feeding's in a few hours.
I mean...

31:57.583 --> 31:59.585
Don't be so sure.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.322
ABRAHAM: Why did you
not tell us this before?

32:03.355 --> 32:05.124
I wanted to.

32:05.157 --> 32:06.225
Chloe and I shut it down.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.094
But why? What if he goes berserk

32:08.127 --> 32:09.061
and starts attacking people,

32:09.095 --> 32:10.963
like Kovacs did? She's right.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.440
Is it even safe for
Jackson to be here?

32:12.464 --> 32:14.033
Well, like it or
not, I have to be,

32:14.066 --> 32:16.235
because without me,
you have no cure.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.703
All right.

32:17.736 --> 32:20.139
There's something
you all should see.

32:22.074 --> 32:24.076
This is the DNA molecule

32:24.110 --> 32:26.678
we all came to know and
love in high school biology.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.014
Double helix.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.282
Two strands of
genetic information,

32:30.316 --> 32:32.218
elegantly entwined together.

32:32.251 --> 32:34.486
This...

32:34.520 --> 32:36.555
is what Jackson's
DNA looks like.

32:36.588 --> 32:40.059
The mutation has caused it
to develop a third strand.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.560
A Triple-Helix?

32:41.593 --> 32:43.171
And this structure isn't
unique to just Jackson.

32:43.195 --> 32:44.030
He shares it

32:44.063 --> 32:46.498
with the vultures,
the ants, the sloth,

32:46.532 --> 32:48.067
the snakes. ABRAHAM: So...

32:48.100 --> 32:49.435
tell us about the cure.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.170
Okay. Well, Jackson is the key.

32:53.072 --> 32:54.606
Because this
Triple-Helix structure

32:54.640 --> 32:57.176
isn't the only thing his DNA
shares with these animals.

32:57.209 --> 32:59.678
They also share genomic fossils.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.080
Extinct genes.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.349
Genetic instructions
that were silenced

33:03.382 --> 33:05.360
millions of years ago,
thought to be non-functional

33:05.384 --> 33:06.718
until now.

33:08.387 --> 33:10.456
If you think of the
rungs on a ladder,

33:10.489 --> 33:12.091
each rung contains

33:12.124 --> 33:13.568
genomic fossils from
a different animal.

33:13.592 --> 33:16.795
If I can identify each one,

33:16.828 --> 33:19.031
and its animal source,

33:19.065 --> 33:20.542
I should be able to
come up with a cure

33:20.566 --> 33:22.101
and reverse the mutation.

33:22.134 --> 33:23.769
You already know four, right?

33:23.802 --> 33:25.071
And they all check out.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.448
So that leaves us
three more animals

33:26.472 --> 33:27.639
to identify and capture.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.109
Once we've identified

33:30.142 --> 33:31.610
all seven genomic fossils,

33:31.643 --> 33:34.680
I should be able to
eliminate that third strand.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.191
DARIELA: Sounds like
you got your work

33:36.215 --> 33:37.283
cut out for you.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.451
We could use your help.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.457
Be good to have you
with us on the team.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.326
What do you say?

33:51.663 --> 33:53.499
Copy that.

33:59.771 --> 34:01.640
Nice pep rally in there.

34:03.475 --> 34:04.576
Wasn't a pep rally.

34:04.610 --> 34:06.712
It's, uh, it's the truth.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.090
I'm glad you're
gonna stay with us.

34:08.114 --> 34:10.216
I know you are.

34:10.248 --> 34:11.683
But you don't want
me on the team

34:11.717 --> 34:14.186
because of the way I
make blueberry pancakes

34:14.219 --> 34:16.188
or to borrow my
hip-hop mix tape.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.523
You want me here

34:17.556 --> 34:19.158
to put a bullet in your head

34:19.190 --> 34:20.326
if you end up like Kovacs.

34:23.795 --> 34:26.132
That's right.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.199
Mitch, Abe...
they won't be able to.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.369
But I can. Because... Yeah.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.771
Because I shut
the door on Chloe.

34:34.340 --> 34:36.574
Maybe you're right.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.744
Maybe I did have three seconds.

34:38.777 --> 34:41.246
Maybe not.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.282
I hesitated.

34:43.315 --> 34:44.750
Maybe if I hesitated more,

34:44.783 --> 34:46.818
Chloe would be alive.

34:46.851 --> 34:48.187
But you...

34:48.219 --> 34:49.121
you go sideways,

34:49.155 --> 34:50.789
like the monster that
killed my friends?

34:50.822 --> 34:53.125
I won't hesitate.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.793
That's a promise.

35:01.367 --> 35:02.501
He's so cute.

35:02.534 --> 35:03.502
MAN: Oh, yes.

35:03.535 --> 35:04.536
Can I touch him?

35:04.570 --> 35:06.172
Absolutely, madam.

35:06.205 --> 35:08.840
MAN: You know,
I think he wants you to have this.

35:08.874 --> 35:09.841
CHLOE: Oh, does he?

35:09.875 --> 35:11.210
MAN: Ah, yes, madam.

35:11.243 --> 35:13.412
This is the symbol
Osram Ne Nsoroma.

35:13.445 --> 35:15.647
It means "the moon
and the star."

35:15.681 --> 35:16.815
Love. Harmony.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.350
Harmony.

35:18.384 --> 35:19.485
I think we could all use

35:19.518 --> 35:21.353
a little bit more
harmony, you know?

35:31.263 --> 35:32.698
How are you doing?

35:34.966 --> 35:37.303
(sighs)

35:40.406 --> 35:41.407
Thanks.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.717
Chloe never stopped believing
that she could fix this.

35:53.319 --> 35:55.321
It's all she wanted.

35:57.523 --> 35:59.525
It's what she died for.

36:03.295 --> 36:05.331
And she's never gonna
be able to see it.

36:08.734 --> 36:10.869
I remember when I
was a little boy,

36:10.902 --> 36:12.638
at my grandmother's funeral.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.841
When all the mourners sang,

36:15.874 --> 36:18.477
I asked my papa.

36:18.510 --> 36:22.814
"What's the point of
singing these songs

36:22.848 --> 36:25.484
if Grandma cannot hear it?"

36:25.517 --> 36:27.653
What did he say?

36:27.686 --> 36:30.389
He said the songs are not sung

36:30.422 --> 36:32.758
for those we sing to,

36:32.791 --> 36:34.926
but for the singer.

36:40.432 --> 36:43.435
I want to see that world
again, Abe.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.371
You will.

36:48.907 --> 36:49.875
To Chloe.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.244
To Chloe.

37:08.427 --> 37:09.528
Jamie!

37:09.561 --> 37:11.463
Hey.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.399
Hey, whoa! JAMIE: Stop it!

37:13.432 --> 37:15.334
Can I at least say good-bye?

37:19.305 --> 37:20.506
Go ahead.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.343
Gwen!

37:24.376 --> 37:26.945
Please, please, please!
This isn't fair, please...

37:26.978 --> 37:29.481
I will do anything!
Please, I will do anything!

37:29.515 --> 37:31.417
Take this.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.785
Throw it in one of the
barrels by the fence.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.554
Gwen, please! No!

37:35.587 --> 37:36.898
This isn't fair! This isn't...
(sobs) Let's go.

37:36.922 --> 37:37.923
Please! Unlock it!

37:37.956 --> 37:39.425
GWEN: Open the gate!

37:39.458 --> 37:40.826
MADDIE: No!

37:40.859 --> 37:41.827
Help!

37:41.860 --> 37:43.329
(Maddie screams)

37:43.362 --> 37:44.730
Stop!

37:44.763 --> 37:46.465
(Maddie screaming)

37:46.498 --> 37:47.733
No!

37:47.766 --> 37:50.336
(sobbing): No! Stop!

37:50.369 --> 37:52.504
Stop! (Screams)

37:52.538 --> 37:54.440
(gate clangs shut)

37:55.474 --> 37:56.575
We're not done here.

37:58.410 --> 38:00.412
I think we are.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.653
Did it work?

38:07.686 --> 38:09.421
I hope so.

38:09.455 --> 38:12.023
(loud snarling)

38:33.979 --> 38:35.481
(people screaming)

38:38.850 --> 38:40.519
(screaming)

38:43.822 --> 38:45.457
Are you okay? Yeah.

38:46.057 --> 38:48.059
(screaming)

38:49.595 --> 38:51.530
The bus.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.698
(snarling)

38:59.170 --> 39:00.539
See if you can find the key.

39:01.139 --> 39:02.107
Let me in!

39:02.140 --> 39:03.775
Jamie, let me...

39:03.809 --> 39:05.977
Jamie, please, please!

39:06.011 --> 39:06.812
(snarling)

39:06.845 --> 39:08.547
No.

39:09.615 --> 39:10.615
Jamie!

39:14.620 --> 39:15.620
Let go!

39:17.423 --> 39:18.590
(roars)

39:18.624 --> 39:19.624
(screams)

39:21.026 --> 39:23.895
(Gwen screaming)

39:28.133 --> 39:29.134
(screaming stops)

39:37.208 --> 39:39.545
(growling)

39:43.048 --> 39:45.150
Take Maddie out the back.
Where are you going?

39:45.183 --> 39:46.552
I'm gonna draw
'em the other way.

39:46.585 --> 39:47.653
What? Like hell you are.

39:47.686 --> 39:49.187
I brought you to Caraquet,

39:49.220 --> 39:50.589
and I'm gonna get you out.

39:50.622 --> 39:51.590
Go.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.525
(bears growling)

40:11.943 --> 40:13.912
Hey!

40:13.945 --> 40:15.947
How many people
are in the school?

40:19.685 --> 40:20.952
Oh, my God.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.492
♪

40:55.554 --> 40:57.556
