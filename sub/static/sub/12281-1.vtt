Go. I got this.

03:10.674 --> 03:11.800
What happened?

03:11.884 --> 03:13.056
She got stuck.

03:26.816 --> 03:29.194
All right, let's
get this thing moving.

03:29.276 --> 03:31.995
I took April's
regular into the VIP room

03:32.071 --> 03:34.950
and he gave me $7,000.

03:35.032 --> 03:36.875
I don't give a fuck.
Fuck that bitch.

03:36.951 --> 03:38.874
She freak out?

03:38.953 --> 03:41.001
Yeah. Is there anything
more unflattering

03:41.080 --> 03:43.003
than patterns on hotel rooms?

03:45.209 --> 03:48.713
I know.
Why can't they just use solid colors?

03:48.796 --> 03:51.390
It's easier to hide the stains.

03:51.465 --> 03:53.217
That's so right.

03:55.761 --> 03:58.014
We gotta get that
fucker on the stand.

04:06.188 --> 04:08.611
Oh. What are you waiting for?

04:10.025 --> 04:12.448
Hi, Mike.

04:12.528 --> 04:15.327
Don't you know what time it is?

04:15.406 --> 04:20.036
The Fire chief is responsible for all decisions
made from the Fire department, right?

04:20.119 --> 04:22.918
Uh, for the most part, yeah.

04:22.997 --> 04:25.716
If the chief of the fire department
was deleting work orders

04:25.791 --> 04:30.513
which directly resulted in sending non-working
trucks to a fire, that's his fault?

04:30.588 --> 04:33.011
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

04:33.090 --> 04:35.843
Then it's all bullshit
they fired a guy for falsifying his resume.

04:35.926 --> 04:38.349
It's 'cause he exposed
the work orders.

04:38.429 --> 04:40.477
It's a little late to change
our tactic, isn't it?

04:40.556 --> 04:43.025
He was wrapped up in the price
of repairs but it didn't matter

04:43.100 --> 04:44.898
because they were never
gonna do the repairs.

04:44.977 --> 04:46.570
Hey, shut the fuck up.

04:46.645 --> 04:48.943
Mike, where are you?

04:49.023 --> 04:50.866
Just hanging out
with some friends.

04:50.941 --> 04:53.569
You know what? You get some sleep.
I got this, okay?

04:53.652 --> 04:55.325
Bye!

04:59.033 --> 05:00.751
Hi.

05:12.463 --> 05:13.680
Are you still sleeping?

05:13.756 --> 05:14.928
Yes.

05:16.509 --> 05:19.763
Ah.

05:19.845 --> 05:22.223
You're joining the jury.
The reason my client is fired

05:22.306 --> 05:24.104
was because he
falsified his resume,

05:24.183 --> 05:26.652
not because he went
above your head

05:26.727 --> 05:30.277
and reported that trucks were not getting
fixed and people were dying as a result.

05:30.356 --> 05:32.279
Say yes.

05:32.358 --> 05:34.281
Yes.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.113
You also said you only went
to review my client's resume

05:37.196 --> 05:41.246
after he went to the media.
Correct?

05:41.325 --> 05:45.171
On May 9th, a truck went to the house of
Alex Foreman with a broken wafer pump.

05:45.246 --> 05:47.419
That resulted in Mr.
Foreman burning to death.

05:47.498 --> 05:50.377
On June 17th, another truck went
to the house of Crystal Dougan

05:50.459 --> 05:52.177
also with a non-working pump,

05:52.253 --> 05:55.177
also resulting in Ms.
Dougan burning to death.

05:55.256 --> 05:56.803
Is that true?

05:56.882 --> 05:58.384
It is.

05:58.467 --> 06:00.561
No shit? Damn.

06:00.636 --> 06:03.389
He knew he sent non-working
fire trucks to houses on fire?

06:03.472 --> 06:05.691
He says he didn't.

06:05.766 --> 06:08.770
You said the trucks were broken
because the work orders were deleted.

06:08.852 --> 06:11.776
The work order could be anything.
It could be a tire alignment,

06:11.855 --> 06:14.074
it could be a tear in the
fucking seat fabric.

06:14.149 --> 06:16.447
But it wasn't a tear
in the fucking seat fabric.

06:16.527 --> 06:18.621
The damn pumps
wouldn't work, right?

06:22.241 --> 06:24.209
So, if the work orders
had been deleted

06:24.285 --> 06:26.788
and you didn't know the
trucks needed to be fixed,

06:26.870 --> 06:29.714
they were never gonna be
repaired to begin with.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.420
After you realized the paperwork system
for the work orders were so screwed up

06:33.502 --> 06:35.675
that you accidentally
approved two fire trucks

06:35.754 --> 06:39.054
that didn't actually have
working water pumps,

06:39.133 --> 06:41.181
realizing this,
because my client

06:41.260 --> 06:44.434
exposed the fire department's
bureaucratic mess to the public,

06:44.513 --> 06:49.269
after you realized this, you
felt the best usage of your time

06:49.351 --> 06:51.729
would not be to go back
and fix the system

06:51.812 --> 06:54.736
in an effort to prevent the
death of more innocent people.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.863
You thought the first
thing you should do

06:56.942 --> 06:59.741
was looking to my client's
job application and resume

06:59.820 --> 07:03.541
even though he'd already been working
for the department for four years.

07:03.616 --> 07:06.085
That may be what it looks like.

07:06.160 --> 07:10.540
I'm sorry, sir, it's a simple question.
Which did you look into first?

07:10.623 --> 07:13.217
The work order system that
had just caused the death

07:13.292 --> 07:15.215
of two innocent people,

07:15.294 --> 07:18.719
or a four-year-old job
application of an employee

07:18.797 --> 07:21.721
that had just publicly
humiliated you?

07:21.800 --> 07:25.680
And I remind your, sir,
that you're under oath.

07:25.763 --> 07:29.358
I guess that the
application was first.

07:32.227 --> 07:34.150
No further questions,
Your Honor.

07:40.611 --> 07:43.956
Have you or someone you love
been injured in an accident

07:44.031 --> 07:47.251
due to the negligence
of another person?

07:47.326 --> 07:50.956
Call Danzinger and Weiss.
The phone call is free

07:51.038 --> 07:53.382
and so is the consultation.

07:53.457 --> 07:56.552
You need professional,
experienced trial lawyers

07:56.627 --> 07:58.925
that care about their clients

07:59.004 --> 08:02.929
to get the cash settlements that
you and your family deserve.

08:03.008 --> 08:06.683
Don't wait. Call today.

08:08.806 --> 08:10.524
Are you serious?

08:10.599 --> 08:13.853
The fact is that auto accidents

08:13.936 --> 08:16.985
and negligence result in
higher personal injury awards

08:17.064 --> 08:20.864
and higher jury awards.
90 % of them never even see the court room.

08:20.943 --> 08:23.287
You should really
take me serious.

08:23.362 --> 08:25.785
You should have a drink, counselor.
We're celebrating.

08:25.864 --> 08:28.117
I remind you that we
would've made more money

08:28.200 --> 08:30.328
if we had settled today's
case before the trial.

08:30.411 --> 08:32.083
Should I remind you
that we won?

08:35.749 --> 08:37.626
Oh, damn.

08:37.710 --> 08:40.839
We won't stay long.
Like five minutes, okay?

08:42.089 --> 08:43.591
Oh, no, thanks.

08:43.674 --> 08:45.051
Have you seen my husband?

08:45.134 --> 08:46.556
Oh, no.

08:51.724 --> 08:54.603
Beer, tequila, Jack, rum?

08:54.685 --> 08:56.232
Fine.

08:59.189 --> 09:01.408
Mike's my legal aide.

09:01.483 --> 09:03.781
Please, tell me you're joking.

09:03.861 --> 09:05.829
Uh, no.

09:05.904 --> 09:08.578
He really hasn't changed
since eighth grade, has he?

09:08.657 --> 09:10.204
No, he hasn't.

09:10.284 --> 09:12.378
Have you seen
my fucking husband?

09:12.453 --> 09:15.252
I think he might be out back.

09:15.330 --> 09:19.676
I haven't ever heard of a goddamn
coaster, you fucking animal!

09:21.503 --> 09:24.177
Can we go now?

09:24.256 --> 09:26.509
How did you get to teach your
class tonight, by the way?

09:26.592 --> 09:28.890
I didn't.

09:28.969 --> 09:32.223
You can't keep canceling your class.
The students have been complaining.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.934
Why? They're all here.

09:35.017 --> 09:39.363
Oh. And the lady, she's still waiting on
those articles on the transportation.

09:39.438 --> 09:42.942
Jesus Christ, you're worse than all legal acts.
No more talk about work.

09:43.025 --> 09:45.494
Everybody, no more talk about work.
This is a party.

09:45.569 --> 09:47.242
It's an interesting
party, too, Mike.

09:47.321 --> 09:49.198
Hey, what's going on?

09:49.281 --> 09:51.750
Hey. What the fuck is that?

09:51.825 --> 09:53.418
It's an alligator.

09:53.494 --> 09:56.088
It's just left outside,
walk around.

10:02.669 --> 10:05.047
Hey, listen, guys.

10:05.130 --> 10:07.383
I can't keep having
my firm give you work

10:07.466 --> 10:09.844
is gonna take
you twice as long...

10:09.927 --> 10:13.181
Twice as long to find the 1994 case
of Kings County vs. Stevenson

10:13.263 --> 10:16.893
which protects the rights of people
with disabilities to keep their pets,

10:16.975 --> 10:20.650
including animals used for emotional
support in cases like depression.

10:20.729 --> 10:22.402
Regardless of the
landlord's policy

10:22.481 --> 10:24.859
making the eviction of
your client illegal,

10:24.942 --> 10:28.162
and upping the value of what will
now be a really nice settlement.

10:28.237 --> 10:31.832
You're welcome.
I'll have it for you by Monday.

10:33.784 --> 10:35.661
Thank you.

10:35.744 --> 10:38.213
You guys are gonna go see
that nurse tomorrow, right?

10:38.288 --> 10:40.086
Yeah.

10:41.333 --> 10:42.755
All right. I gotta go.

10:42.835 --> 10:44.462
What do you mean you gotta go?

10:44.545 --> 10:46.422
I can't stay.
Rita's in the car right now.

10:46.505 --> 10:48.303
Your lizard tried
to bite her foot.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.225
Was she wearing white shoes?
He hates those.

10:50.300 --> 10:52.268
Don't go. You just got here.

10:52.344 --> 10:54.563
I got a white supremacist I
want you to straighten out.

10:54.638 --> 10:56.265
Are you serious?

10:56.348 --> 10:58.771
It'd be a great conversation.

10:58.851 --> 11:02.355
Jamie, what the fuck? Are you nuts?
There are people upstairs.

11:02.437 --> 11:06.112
In our bed, in our fucking
bed, you asshole!

11:06.191 --> 11:09.616
Jamie, we should talk about
this, but this is not the way.

11:09.695 --> 11:13.120
Apologize.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.626
Apologize!

11:16.702 --> 11:19.455
♪ We are the same ♪

11:19.538 --> 11:22.041
I'm sorry.

11:24.543 --> 11:26.386
I want a divorce.

11:26.461 --> 11:29.061
♪ We are the same ♪

11:35.429 --> 11:37.227
I'll see ya.

11:41.977 --> 11:44.196
All right, everyone,
drama's over.

11:45.314 --> 11:46.406
Fuck.

11:52.571 --> 11:54.869
Why do you still have
this piece of crap?

11:54.948 --> 11:57.246
I love this car.
You can drive it.

12:00.162 --> 12:03.166
That drink smells
like wide open ass.

12:03.248 --> 12:06.127
Good for the body,
good for the soul.

12:06.209 --> 12:07.836
Mr. Health Nut.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.968
You treat your digestive
tract like a sewer.

12:10.047 --> 12:13.847
All that soda is gonna
destroy your esophagus.

12:28.607 --> 12:30.575
So, did you get your gun back?

12:32.277 --> 12:33.699
Not yet.

12:33.779 --> 12:35.326
You all right?

12:35.405 --> 12:37.157
She'll be back soon.

12:42.871 --> 12:46.717
So, after I got
over myself a bit, I decided to fight.

12:46.792 --> 12:48.715
Oh, thank you, sweetie.

12:48.794 --> 12:53.891
I mean, AIDS isn't a
death sentence any more.

12:53.966 --> 12:57.220
And the medicine gets better
and better every year.

12:57.302 --> 12:59.054
Oh, sure, yes, of course.

12:59.137 --> 13:00.389
This is all we had.

13:00.472 --> 13:02.099
David, a glass?

13:02.182 --> 13:04.731
That's fine. We're okay.
Thank you, David.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.653
Can I play with Mr. Deedles?

13:06.728 --> 13:08.651
Of course, hon. Of course.

13:11.108 --> 13:16.239
Anyway, Daryl said if anybody
could help, it'd be you fellas.

13:16.321 --> 13:19.996
My friend Jeffrey invented
this after my accident.

13:20.075 --> 13:23.420
It's a safety needle.

13:23.495 --> 13:25.918
Can't prick yourself,
can't be reused.

13:25.998 --> 13:30.128
A safety needle like this could prevent
incidents like mine from ever happening.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.429
And the hospital refuses
to even look at if.

13:32.504 --> 13:35.553
Excuse me, so you were
injured on the job,

13:35.632 --> 13:37.976
but are you receiving
worker's compensation?

13:38.051 --> 13:40.099
Yes, they've kept up
with that end of it.

13:40.178 --> 13:42.556
Uh, unfortunately

13:42.639 --> 13:45.017
I don't think there's anything
else that can be done.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.024
That's all of the law
provides for and, uh...

13:48.103 --> 13:50.322
It's really all we can get you.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.570
But I-I don't want
anything else.

13:52.649 --> 13:57.246
Not personally anyway.
You see, my case is not an isolated incident.

13:57.320 --> 14:01.325
This thing is happening to front line
health care professionals all the time.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.251
We're very sorry.

14:03.326 --> 14:05.704
We have to make them use this.
The bottom line is,

14:05.787 --> 14:09.291
the hospitals are knowing they're
putting their employees at risk

14:09.374 --> 14:13.595
letting them get hurt.
People are dying.

14:17.632 --> 14:20.886
And then
again I feel this tap.

14:20.969 --> 14:22.892
More like a late dump.

14:24.723 --> 14:26.225
it's a babe.

14:37.986 --> 14:40.409
What I'm saying is we've
been netting on average

14:40.489 --> 14:43.413
for each injury settlement
about 50 to 20 K, right?

14:43.492 --> 14:45.335
Keep stringing a few
of these together a month

14:45.410 --> 14:47.333
and we can actually be in
the black by February.

14:47.412 --> 14:49.585
How often do you think that
needle stick thing happens?

14:49.664 --> 14:51.291
You think it's
like a daily thing?

14:51.374 --> 14:54.674
I don't know.
There's no case here anyway.

14:54.753 --> 14:57.051
If we could prove the
hospitals were negligent,

14:57.130 --> 15:00.100
our clients could be every
hospital worker in the country.

15:00.175 --> 15:03.270
Mike, we can't afford to go on a
fishing expedition right now.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.148
I think we should
go meet that guy.

15:07.224 --> 15:09.318
The guy that invented
the safety needle.

15:17.901 --> 15:20.370
If you come with me to
meet Jeffrey the inventor,

15:20.445 --> 15:22.118
I'll give you three
focused days.

15:22.197 --> 15:24.575
Three extremely focused,
eight-hour days,

15:24.658 --> 15:28.583
interviewing as many accident victims
trying to squeeze the insurance company

15:28.662 --> 15:32.963
for an extra $12
as you want. Deal?

15:33.041 --> 15:35.043
Deal.

15:55.897 --> 15:57.570
Give me that clamp.

15:57.649 --> 15:59.572
Jeffrey Dancort.

15:59.651 --> 16:01.574
That's me.

16:01.653 --> 16:04.577
Paul Danzinger.
We're lawyers from Danzinger and Weiss.

16:06.241 --> 16:08.164
He a lawyer, too?

16:08.243 --> 16:10.166
This is Mike Weiss, my partner.

16:14.332 --> 16:18.758
I was working as a mechanical and
structural engineer when Vicky got stuck.

16:18.837 --> 16:20.839
So, you guys met her?

16:20.922 --> 16:23.095
Uh, yeah, we did.
It's a terrible shame.

16:23.175 --> 16:26.179
She's my best friend's kid.
That really hit me.

16:26.261 --> 16:29.435
I spent about a year working
on developing the concept.

16:29.514 --> 16:33.235
Sooner or later the National Institute
of Health gave me a $50,000-grant

16:33.310 --> 16:36.189
to develop a prototype
for reproduction.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.148
Anyone ever use it?

16:38.231 --> 16:40.609
San Antonio Memorial Hospital
used it for two years.

16:40.692 --> 16:42.444
How's that working out?

16:42.527 --> 16:45.201
Not a single needle stick
incident in two years.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.954
So, there's no way you can
get stuck with this thing.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.252
Can't get stuck with it,
can't reuse it.

16:50.327 --> 16:53.831
Doctor's love it and
nurses are begging for it.

16:53.914 --> 16:56.463
Only San Antonio
Memorial will buy it.

16:56.541 --> 16:58.839
Why?

16:58.919 --> 17:01.547
I thought you guys
could tell me that.

17:01.630 --> 17:05.806
To start you should call at least 200
hospitals over the next couple of weeks.

17:05.884 --> 17:08.387
Two hundred hospitals.

17:08.470 --> 17:11.394
I know it sounds a lot, but we're
gonna need to do is get a data base...

17:11.473 --> 17:13.316
I've already approached
2,000 hospitals.

17:13.391 --> 17:15.609
What'd say when you
showed them the needle?

17:15.685 --> 17:18.029
They asked me to leave.

17:18.104 --> 17:20.778
Is there any way we can sue a
hospital for not buying something

17:20.857 --> 17:23.531
that saves people's lives?

18:00.563 --> 18:05.490
So called miracle drug allegedly
causes client to suffer a stroke.

18:05.568 --> 18:10.039
He's currently waging his battle against
another pharmaceutical company.

18:10.115 --> 18:12.117
Top personal injury,
attorney Mark Lenier.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.248
This is absolutely outrageous.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.331
This is big pharma deciding
that they can take my client

18:17.414 --> 18:19.382
and make him a Guinea pig,

18:19.457 --> 18:22.256
test their medicines on him,
make their money off of him,

18:22.335 --> 18:25.509
and then just disregard him and
throw him away when he breaks.

18:25.588 --> 18:28.011
And that's outrageous
and we're gonna stop it.

18:28.091 --> 18:30.719
We're gonna stop it right
here in this court house.

18:30.802 --> 18:33.897
He's good.

18:33.972 --> 18:36.145
He's very good.

18:54.451 --> 18:56.249
Thank you for agreeing
to talk with me.

18:56.328 --> 18:58.456
Sure, no problem. Talk.

18:58.538 --> 19:01.417
On the phone you said you
were aware of the high number

19:01.499 --> 19:03.172
of accidental needle sticks.

19:03.251 --> 19:05.345
How about 800,000 a year?

19:05.420 --> 19:06.922
Is that an accurate number?

19:07.005 --> 19:08.678
You don't believe me?

19:08.757 --> 19:10.509
No, it's not that
I don't believe you.

19:10.592 --> 19:12.720
I just wanna know if
it's an accurate number.

19:12.802 --> 19:16.227
I, Karen Brown, head of the Texas
Nurses' Association District Five

19:16.306 --> 19:19.731
do officially swear that that
number is accurate. Better?

19:19.809 --> 19:22.403
I'm just trying to get a
better understanding here.

19:22.479 --> 19:25.028
Good. Then here's what you
need to understand. Okay?

19:25.106 --> 19:26.904
The major cause
of these diseases,

19:26.983 --> 19:29.736
hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV,

19:29.819 --> 19:32.288
affecting all front line
health care workers

19:32.364 --> 19:34.583
is because of accidental
needle sticks.

19:34.657 --> 19:36.375
Okay?

19:36.451 --> 19:39.421
Okay. The reason I'm
here is 'cause my client

19:39.496 --> 19:43.376
has invented a safety needle that can
prevent this from ever happening again.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.631
Then don't talk to me.

19:45.710 --> 19:46.962
Who should I talk to?

19:47.045 --> 19:48.888
The purchasing department.

19:50.465 --> 19:52.513
Purchasing. Thank you.

19:54.636 --> 19:55.762
Mr. Weismann.

19:55.845 --> 19:57.688
Weiss. Mike, please.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.517
Mr. Weiss, I cannot and will
not look at your needle.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.695
Because of the purchasing
contract that the hospital has.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.568
Will you at least
look at this data?

20:05.647 --> 20:06.990
No.

20:07.065 --> 20:08.817
Would you mind telling me why?

20:08.900 --> 20:11.403
I don't want you
to show me your data,

20:11.486 --> 20:14.911
and I don't want you to show
this product to my nurses

20:14.989 --> 20:18.744
because they'll want it,
and they can't have it.

20:21.329 --> 20:23.923
What kind of a shirt was it?

20:23.998 --> 20:27.377
Was it a nice shirt?

20:27.460 --> 20:31.966
Yes, Mr.
Paul, it was nice.

20:32.048 --> 20:34.267
Was it a special shirt?

20:34.342 --> 20:37.312
Special?

20:37.387 --> 20:39.981
Maybe it was, a, uh, gift.

20:42.767 --> 20:45.111
It was just a shirt.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.698
How much did you say it cost?

20:48.773 --> 20:51.572
Uh.

20:51.651 --> 20:52.743
I don't remember.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.696
Let's say $70.

20:56.448 --> 21:02.171
Sylvia, could you, uh,
try Mike again, please?

21:02.245 --> 21:06.000
Not if you wanna leave with all ten of
those tiny little fingers, young man.

21:06.082 --> 21:08.756
I just left him
a fifth message.

22:51.563 --> 22:53.361
Mike.

22:53.439 --> 22:55.817
Paul, you're awake.
You're not gonna believe this.

22:55.900 --> 22:59.621
I worked my way into a meeting with the
director of Infection at the hospital.

22:59.696 --> 23:01.323
What?

23:01.406 --> 23:05.001
That was today? Oh, shit, man.

23:06.119 --> 23:08.087
Hello?

23:18.381 --> 23:22.477
He said that Safety Point is fucking
essential to the safety of hospital...

23:26.598 --> 23:30.478
I mean, we're looking at a shitload
of violations under State Law.

23:32.812 --> 23:36.988
Several violations on a shitload
of counts under false claims.

23:51.456 --> 23:53.208
I'm looking for it.

23:53.291 --> 23:55.635
Take it, take it.
And I'll call him after lunch.

23:55.710 --> 23:57.053
All right.

23:57.128 --> 23:59.005
I'll call him after lunch.

23:59.088 --> 24:01.466
The Nursing Association I
represent requested I call

24:01.549 --> 24:05.053
in hopes that you'd help them with their
campaign in regards to this matter.

24:05.136 --> 24:07.605
If you'd give me a call back,
that'd be great, if not...

24:09.432 --> 24:11.685
Senator O'Hara's from Nebraska.

24:11.768 --> 24:13.486
Nebraska?

24:13.561 --> 24:15.939
Yeah, there's only 100 centers.
We could call...

24:16.022 --> 24:18.150
You mean we're like a team?

24:18.232 --> 24:20.826
That we agreed upon things
then we do them together?

24:20.902 --> 24:22.199
I said I was sorry.

24:22.278 --> 24:23.951
Twenty-two straight hours...

24:24.030 --> 24:26.533
I'm sorry.
Did you get the file I sent over?

24:26.616 --> 24:31.247
I got it. GPO's have been bribed to buy
certain products for the hospitals.

24:31.329 --> 24:33.957
I sent it over
to Dancort already.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.294
In the '80s, these GPO's got so big,
they managed to pass a bill in Congress

24:37.377 --> 24:39.880
allowing them a 3 % commission
from the manufacturers

24:39.962 --> 24:41.964
they're supposedly
negotiating with.

24:42.048 --> 24:43.595
We have a great case here.

24:43.675 --> 24:45.302
Yeah, we do.

24:45.385 --> 24:46.807
I'm sorry, what was your name?

24:46.886 --> 24:48.433
Susie.

24:48.513 --> 24:50.106
Would you give us
a second, please?

24:50.181 --> 24:51.979
Sure. I'll be right outside.

24:56.062 --> 24:58.736
Look. Mike, I think that
we have a great case here,

24:58.815 --> 25:02.786
potentially really great, but I need you
to be practical with me for a minute.

25:02.860 --> 25:04.487
Like hospitals
letting people die

25:04.570 --> 25:06.914
because Safety Point
costs five cents more?

25:06.989 --> 25:10.960
Mike, I'm in, all right? I'm in.
It's just that if this thing gets too big,

25:11.035 --> 25:13.254
you need to let me bring in
another firm to help out.

25:13.329 --> 25:15.832
This thing is gonna
settle by Christmas.

25:15.915 --> 25:18.794
It could drag for years. It's a monopoly
case and we're not an antitrust firm.

25:18.876 --> 25:21.470
What kinda firm we wanna be, Paul?
This is gonna make us.

25:21.546 --> 25:23.924
It could break us.
It's gonna be extremely expensive.

25:24.006 --> 25:27.351
Dancort can't afford to pay us and I
can't do enough injury cases on my own.

25:27.427 --> 25:30.180
What do you want me to say?
I'm sorry, all right?

25:30.263 --> 25:32.436
I'm sorry I messed
the fucking line.

25:32.515 --> 25:35.564
Mike, listen to me. I'm telling you
that we don't have the resources

25:35.643 --> 25:37.816
to take this thing
all the way, so please.

25:37.895 --> 25:41.365
I need your word that when I tell
you that the well is running dry,

25:41.441 --> 25:43.739
we bring in another firm
to help out, okay?

25:43.818 --> 25:48.244
Yeah. Yes.
Can we get to work now, please?

25:48.322 --> 25:50.791
Sorry.
Am I interrupting something?

25:50.867 --> 25:52.915
No, not at all. Come in.

25:52.994 --> 25:54.371
Thanks for coming down.

25:54.454 --> 25:56.001
Have a seat.

25:56.080 --> 25:58.458
Well, right here
I got an invitation

25:58.541 --> 26:01.340
to a supplier's to
attend a conference

26:01.419 --> 26:05.265
from the United Medical
Health Supplies people.

26:05.339 --> 26:08.468
Largest group purchasing
organization in the country.

26:08.551 --> 26:11.145
And guess how much it costs
to attend the conference?

26:11.220 --> 26:12.813
How much?

26:12.889 --> 26:14.812
$25, 000.

26:14.891 --> 26:16.484
Twenty-five grand?

26:16.559 --> 26:18.482
What does that get you?

26:20.980 --> 26:24.701
I went to one of these dog and
pony shows about three years back

26:24.776 --> 26:29.498
for the low price of 75 grand,
and I didn't get jack shit.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.833
Hey. Mike Weiss.

26:32.909 --> 26:34.877
How are you?

26:34.952 --> 26:37.455
I am excited.

26:37.538 --> 26:42.669
These GPO guys represent over 4,000
health care providers in the US

26:42.752 --> 26:45.551
and they supply 'em
with $80 billion

26:45.630 --> 26:48.509
in medical products every year.

26:48.591 --> 26:51.720
Walkers and canes
and wheelchairs,

26:51.803 --> 26:54.352
commodes, bedpans.

26:54.430 --> 26:57.559
The only way to get your
product into hospitals

26:57.642 --> 26:59.519
is to go through these fuckers,

26:59.602 --> 27:01.730
so you have to pay
thousands of dollars

27:01.813 --> 27:04.692
for the opportunity to grovel in front
of a couple

27:04.774 --> 27:07.448
of United Medical Health
Supply muckety-mucks.

27:07.527 --> 27:08.653
Mike Weiss.

27:08.736 --> 27:10.329
Thanks for coming.

27:10.404 --> 27:12.202
But it's all just horse shit.

27:12.281 --> 27:14.875
You need real money
to get anything done...

27:14.951 --> 27:18.501
Gonna help prevent accidents from
happening to your patients and employees.

27:18.579 --> 27:21.458
And over time, it's gonna save you
money and it's gonna save lives.

27:21.541 --> 27:24.420
Does that sound like something
that might interest you?

27:24.502 --> 27:30.726
Are you aware there are over 800,000
accidental needle sticks a year?

27:30.800 --> 27:33.428
For 25,000, you can't
even stay for lunch.

27:33.511 --> 27:36.060
How much does it cost
to stay for lunch?

27:36.138 --> 27:38.391
Millions.

27:46.691 --> 27:48.785
♪ Take me to see
The voodoo queen ♪

27:48.860 --> 27:50.737
♪ Let her put A spell on me ♪

27:54.657 --> 27:56.830
Whatever you do, don't
let me fall asleep.

27:56.909 --> 28:00.038
I think you'll be okay.
For four hours only.

28:05.167 --> 28:06.464
Want a hand job?

28:06.544 --> 28:08.592
Sure.

28:21.392 --> 28:24.020
They're gonna videotape me?

28:24.103 --> 28:26.481
We're gonna be okay.

28:26.564 --> 28:28.566
Hi. Paul Danzinger.

28:32.361 --> 28:33.533
Over here?

28:33.613 --> 28:35.240
Yeah. Let's have a seat.

29:02.767 --> 29:05.270
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

29:15.947 --> 29:17.574
Gentlemen.

29:17.657 --> 29:20.001
Thank you for coming.
It's much appreciated.

29:20.076 --> 29:21.373
Paul Danzinger.

29:21.452 --> 29:23.830
You must be Mr. Dancort.

29:23.913 --> 29:25.665
This grip. You golf?

29:25.748 --> 29:27.591
No, I don't golf.

29:27.667 --> 29:30.011
Why so grumpy?

29:30.086 --> 29:33.135
You get the chance to eat?
Breakfast's the most important meal of the day.

29:33.214 --> 29:36.184
Would somebody please bring Mr.
Dancort a cup of coffee and a Danish?

29:42.098 --> 29:44.692
So, let's get down to it.
Are we waiting for one more?

29:44.767 --> 29:46.394
Let's just begin.

29:46.477 --> 29:49.151
Okay. Mr. Dancort,
we are here today

29:49.230 --> 29:52.530
so we can ask you some questions regarding
your allegations against my client.

29:52.608 --> 29:55.077
Before we begin, I would like
to establish for the record

29:55.152 --> 29:58.406
that you're aware that the deposition
is sworn testimony under oath.

29:58.489 --> 30:00.241
Yeah, yeah.

30:00.324 --> 30:02.497
The court reporter will
be recording the session

30:02.576 --> 30:05.705
in the event that we would choose
to show the jury your testimony

30:05.788 --> 30:08.667
in a court of law.
If at any time during these proceedings

30:08.749 --> 30:11.423
you feel the need for a break,
please feel free to do so.

30:11.502 --> 30:13.345
Is everything clear so far?

30:13.421 --> 30:14.923
Is that a yes or a no, sir?

30:15.006 --> 30:16.758
Yes.

30:16.841 --> 30:19.185
Thank you. I'd like to
start by asking questions

30:19.260 --> 30:22.013
about your background.
Would you please tell me your full name?

30:22.096 --> 30:24.895
Jeffrey Matthew Dancort.

30:24.974 --> 30:26.772
Could you spell that, please?

30:26.851 --> 30:30.776
Jeffrey, J-E-F-F-R-E-Y.

30:30.855 --> 30:33.324
Matthew, M-A-T-T-H-E-W.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.822
Dancort, D-A -N-C-O-R- T.

30:35.901 --> 30:37.778
Thank you.
Current address, please.

30:37.862 --> 30:41.662
1429 Merryweather drive,

30:41.741 --> 30:45.871
Houston, Texas, 74561.

30:45.953 --> 30:48.797
Thank you.
Is that an apartment or a house?

30:48.873 --> 30:50.625
It's a house.

30:50.708 --> 30:52.130
For how long have
you lived there?

30:52.209 --> 30:53.756
I don't know, about ten years.

30:53.836 --> 30:56.339
About ten years
or exactly ten years?

30:56.422 --> 30:58.265
We moved in there in 1986.

30:58.340 --> 31:00.308
That would be 12 years.

31:00.384 --> 31:02.728
Yeah, that sounds about right.

31:02.803 --> 31:06.023
Sounds right or is right?
If you moved there in 1986, that would be 12 years.

31:06.098 --> 31:08.317
Be polite.

31:08.392 --> 31:10.019
Yes, that's right, sir.

31:11.896 --> 31:14.490
One moment, please.

31:14.565 --> 31:15.737
Right.

31:31.791 --> 31:33.464
Oh, Shit.

31:33.542 --> 31:35.135
Oh, fuck.

31:36.504 --> 31:38.347
Fuck.

31:39.423 --> 31:41.221
Fucking.

31:42.885 --> 31:45.058
Fuck!

32:01.654 --> 32:04.533
Besides football, did you
play any other sport?

32:04.615 --> 32:06.583
What the hell are we
talking about football?

32:06.659 --> 32:09.879
We case here to discuss the case.
Let's discuss the case.

32:09.954 --> 32:12.958
We wanted to get some simple
background information.

32:13.040 --> 32:15.338
I'd like to request that my
client take a break now.

32:15.417 --> 32:19.388
Let the record reflect that the plaintiff's
attorney has asked for a break

32:19.463 --> 32:21.215
without answering the question.

32:21.298 --> 32:23.517
That's okay. Keep going.
Just keep going.

32:23.592 --> 32:26.471
Continuing, besides football,
did you play any other...

32:43.112 --> 32:45.865
Excuse me. Nathaniel Price.

32:45.948 --> 32:47.825
I am.

32:47.908 --> 32:51.208
Mike Weiss.
Guess I'll be seeing you in court.

32:51.287 --> 32:53.130
I'm looking forward to it.

32:53.205 --> 32:54.422
Good.

32:54.498 --> 32:56.000
Excuse me.

32:58.586 --> 33:00.088
Where the fuck were you?

33:00.171 --> 33:01.514
Not here. Outside.

33:05.801 --> 33:08.520
And what was the name of your first
dog, Mr. Dancort?

33:08.596 --> 33:11.566
Oh, well, Rufus.
And how do you spell that, Mr. Dancort?

33:11.640 --> 33:16.316
R-U-F-U-S. And were you fond
of this dog, Mr. Dancort?

33:16.395 --> 33:19.524
Not particularly. Does that mean
you dislike dogs, Mr. Dancort?

33:19.607 --> 33:21.905
They showed themselves today.

33:21.984 --> 33:25.113
They wouldn't have brought up the big
guns if they weren't scared of you.

33:25.196 --> 33:27.949
Yeah, they're terrified.
Scared fucking shitless all twelve of them.

33:28.032 --> 33:31.411
The reason I wasn't there today is 'cause
I was talking to a good buddy of mine.

33:31.493 --> 33:33.746
Henry Matthews, editor-in-chief
of the Houston Chronicle.

33:33.829 --> 33:36.628
They're going to run
a story on you.

33:36.707 --> 33:39.130
I'll see you guys
back at the office.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.053
Houston Chronicle.

33:41.128 --> 33:43.301
This is attorney Mike Weiss
calling for Henry Matthews.

33:43.380 --> 33:46.179
We don't have a Henry Matthews.
We have a Henry Mathers.

33:46.258 --> 33:48.431
That's what I meant.
Henry Mathers. Thank you.

33:48.510 --> 33:50.387
He's not in.
Would you like his voice mail?

33:50.471 --> 33:51.848
Sure.

33:51.931 --> 33:53.433
One moment, please.

34:09.572 --> 34:11.621
As soon as the sun goes down,
I'll be over there.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.327
Hey.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.003
Law and order. What's up?
What you need?

34:15.079 --> 34:16.706
Two hundred.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.973
This is Mike.

34:27.049 --> 34:29.472
What the hell kinda friends
have you got, Mike?

34:29.551 --> 34:32.179
Maybe you got some other
friends who can help us out.

34:32.263 --> 34:35.107
It's how these people operate.
They must've threatened the paper.

34:35.181 --> 34:37.230
I don't know what they
did or how they did it.

34:37.309 --> 34:40.438
I've just spent hours on the
phone dealing with my investors,

34:40.521 --> 34:45.368
my wife, my mother. This article claims
I'm having an affair with my assistant.

34:45.442 --> 34:47.570
Are you having an affair
with your assistant?

34:47.652 --> 34:49.781
No.

34:49.862 --> 34:52.867
Then what are you worried about?
They're just trying to smear you.

34:52.949 --> 34:55.203
This is to be expected.

34:55.286 --> 34:58.256
They're gonna try and make as many
people hate your guts as possible

34:58.330 --> 35:00.879
before we go to trial.

35:00.958 --> 35:03.757
Paul is making a lot of traction
with a lot of investors for you.

35:03.836 --> 35:06.089
When I get these motherfuckers
in front of the judge,

35:06.171 --> 35:09.641
we're gonna get your needle in every
single hospital in the country.

35:12.886 --> 35:16.015
Stay strong.
I'll see you in court.

35:17.891 --> 35:19.518
Is that Armani?

35:20.519 --> 35:22.192
Believe it.

35:54.678 --> 35:57.022
Is that a tux?

35:57.097 --> 35:59.270
It's Armani.

36:10.819 --> 36:12.571
All rise.

36:14.907 --> 36:17.911
The United States Federal
District Court is now in session.

36:17.993 --> 36:20.371
The Honorable Judge
William Black presiding.

36:22.790 --> 36:24.337
Be seated.

36:25.876 --> 36:27.423
Right.

36:27.503 --> 36:29.426
We are here
on plaintiff's motion

36:29.505 --> 36:31.428
to compel the
production of documents

36:31.507 --> 36:33.726
that the plaintiff
claims are necessary.

36:33.801 --> 36:35.803
Since the defendants
are not allowing him...

36:35.886 --> 36:37.638
Your Honor, the
defendant's client has...

36:37.721 --> 36:39.098
No, no, Mr. Weiss.

36:39.181 --> 36:42.276
Sorry, Your Honor.

36:42.351 --> 36:45.446
It's an extraordinary large
request for production.

36:45.521 --> 36:47.944
Which documents must
you have and why?

36:49.358 --> 36:51.110
Request for production one.

36:51.193 --> 36:53.867
All exclusive long term
and multi-product contracts

36:53.946 --> 36:56.540
between United Medical Health
Supplies and all hospitals

36:56.615 --> 36:59.835
over the last ten years.
We feel this information will prove the GPO

36:59.910 --> 37:02.880
is engaged in anticompetitive
behavior, price fixing,

37:02.955 --> 37:05.333
and a contract that requires
the company to buy products

37:05.416 --> 37:07.510
even though they may not
be the safest available.

37:07.584 --> 37:09.461
Under Dakota
vs. PMI Industries,

37:09.545 --> 37:11.468
the Supreme Court
found this information.

37:11.547 --> 37:14.346
Mr. Price, your response.

37:14.425 --> 37:17.474
Judge, this is a fishing
expedition with no merit.

37:17.553 --> 37:19.931
To expect thousands
of pages of documents

37:20.013 --> 37:23.358
is unduly burdensome to my
client's time and money.

37:23.434 --> 37:26.438
And the Dakota case
is not on point.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.942
Next request.

37:28.021 --> 37:30.695
Request of production 75.

37:30.774 --> 37:33.527
All donations made by the defendant
to health care organizations

37:33.610 --> 37:35.908
or political entities.

37:35.988 --> 37:39.117
Political contributions are not
discoverable under Benet vs. Lappin.

37:39.199 --> 37:41.998
Contributions to health care
organizations are not political.

37:42.077 --> 37:44.125
Next request, please.

37:44.204 --> 37:47.208
All purchase history of syringe
manufacturers made by the GPO

37:47.291 --> 37:49.885
in the past ten years.
We feel that this information proves

37:49.960 --> 37:52.679
that United Medical Health
Supplies has created a monopoly

37:52.754 --> 37:55.724
by buying syringe manufacturers,
then jacking up the price.

37:55.799 --> 37:58.769
Your Honor, the purchase and sale of
businesses are all of public records.

37:58.844 --> 38:01.017
My client shouldn't have
to go through the expense.

38:01.096 --> 38:04.191
Your Honor, we've submitted
cases supporting our position.

38:04.266 --> 38:06.815
The law clearly states we're
entitled to these documents.

38:11.482 --> 38:15.077
All right. My decision
is as follows.

38:15.152 --> 38:18.201
The court denies document
production one, two, three.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.624
Your Honor, we have the right...

38:20.699 --> 38:23.703
Request of production 1 through 12 denied.
13, 14, 15 are firm,

38:23.785 --> 38:27.289
but I'm limiting production
to one year, not ten years.

38:27.372 --> 38:31.252
Sixteen through twenty-nine, denied.
Court adjourned.

38:33.128 --> 38:35.222
You must
be so relieved.

38:35.297 --> 38:37.550
We are ecstatic.
It's been three years in the making

38:37.633 --> 38:39.681
and we finally
got some justice.

38:39.760 --> 38:43.606
How do you suppose the jury
arrived at a $53 million verdict?

38:43.680 --> 38:47.310
I think the jury took that figure
from the profits the company made

38:47.392 --> 38:49.611
off not putting
the safety feature on.

38:49.686 --> 38:52.986
They are not gonna let corporate
greed trump the value of human life.

38:53.065 --> 38:56.365
Let's talk about the family.
We're dealing with an eight-year-old boy.

38:56.443 --> 38:58.571
How are they doing right now?

38:58.654 --> 39:01.783
They're doing okay, but the
eight-year-old boy, he goes home with...

39:01.865 --> 39:04.459
Safety Point's a
bigger case than that.

39:04.535 --> 39:08.915
You know that every American will get into
at least one car accident in their lifetime?

39:08.997 --> 39:12.592
You know what the biggest reason is
that people get into car accidents?

39:14.169 --> 39:15.762
Eating while driving?

39:15.837 --> 39:17.760
Mm. No, that's only 49 %.

39:17.839 --> 39:21.309
Talking to the other
passenger, 81 %.

39:21.385 --> 39:23.479
Fascinating.

39:23.554 --> 39:24.806
Where are you going?

39:24.888 --> 39:26.640
I'm gonna go talk to him.

39:26.723 --> 39:28.817
Hi, fellas.

39:28.892 --> 39:31.566
Are you boys hungry?

39:31.645 --> 39:33.067
Yeah, sure.

39:33.146 --> 39:34.989
Well.

39:35.065 --> 39:37.318
The process is one where
you fight in the courtroom

39:37.401 --> 39:41.656
for three weeks, and then
you've got an appeal going.

39:41.738 --> 39:45.083
And then we'll have that fight
and we'll win that fight.

39:52.165 --> 39:55.009
Could you bring us a couple of
orders of shrimp cocktail, please?

39:55.085 --> 39:57.463
I'm allergic to shellfish.

39:59.006 --> 40:00.679
Good to see you.

40:03.135 --> 40:06.730
Listen, I-I don't wanna be
here today as a law firm.

40:06.805 --> 40:09.558
I'd like to talk.
One person to another.

40:09.641 --> 40:11.609
What do you want?

40:11.685 --> 40:13.687
I'll tell you
what I don't want.

40:13.770 --> 40:16.649
I don't wanna see you two going
down, and you're going down.

40:16.732 --> 40:18.905
Do I care who wins or loses?

40:18.984 --> 40:21.658
Hardly. I have a job,
I do my job

40:21.737 --> 40:23.535
and I get paid at the end
of the day either way.

40:23.614 --> 40:25.241
How much you get paid?

40:25.324 --> 40:27.793
You're funny, Mike.

40:27.868 --> 40:29.666
I like that you
have a sense of humor.

40:29.745 --> 40:31.463
What can we do for you?

40:31.538 --> 40:33.131
You know who my client is.

40:33.206 --> 40:35.129
You're looking
at 300 attorneys,

40:35.208 --> 40:37.256
two dozen of the top anti-trust
experts in the country,

40:37.336 --> 40:40.510
millions of dollars in resources,
connections in every corner

40:40.589 --> 40:44.014
of the health care system, not
to mention the justice system.

40:44.092 --> 40:45.639
Don't forget the newspapers.

40:45.719 --> 40:46.891
The banks.

40:46.970 --> 40:49.473
Mm-hm. That's correct.

40:49.556 --> 40:51.558
Your client,

40:51.642 --> 40:54.065
he's something else.
He's an idealistic bumpkin

40:54.144 --> 40:56.397
who's been knocking on
every door in the city

40:56.480 --> 40:58.574
trying to get a loan.

40:58.649 --> 41:00.947
And you know why
he's not getting one?

41:01.026 --> 41:03.825
'Cause my client
didn't want him to.

41:03.904 --> 41:06.407
So, are you saying that
there's a possibility

41:06.490 --> 41:08.868
of us actually
settling this fairly?

41:08.950 --> 41:12.875
Absolutely not. That's the only
thing that my client can't afford.

41:12.954 --> 41:17.835
If they gave you a settlement, they'll be
looking at lawsuits the rest of their lives.

41:17.918 --> 41:19.920
They aren't gonna do that.

41:20.003 --> 41:23.507
So, just do yourselves a favor.
Cut your losses now.

41:23.590 --> 41:27.595
You guys got no case.
No way out.

41:27.678 --> 41:31.103
Well, we appreciate
your concern.

41:31.181 --> 41:36.438
Son, you can't make chicken
salad out of chicken shit.

41:36.520 --> 41:39.364
Good day.

41:39.439 --> 41:41.032
Bob.

41:59.292 --> 42:01.386
She left a note.

42:14.224 --> 42:15.851
Come on, buddy.

42:23.650 --> 42:27.200
Providing the
best health care products

42:27.279 --> 42:29.657
from Asia to Africa

42:29.740 --> 42:31.834
to here at home.

42:31.908 --> 42:35.162
United Medical Health Supplies.

42:35.245 --> 42:36.963
Together in caring.

42:41.877 --> 42:43.675
What's up?

42:43.754 --> 42:47.509
My new equity partners just
backed out on Dancort.

42:47.591 --> 42:49.719
That was the last investor.

42:52.220 --> 42:53.813
Sorry.

42:53.889 --> 42:55.266
Me foo.

42:55.348 --> 42:57.567
Is there anything I can do?

42:57.642 --> 43:00.737
Can you convince another firm to come
on board and take over the case?

43:03.607 --> 43:07.862
Sorry. You need something?

43:07.944 --> 43:12.541
Bills. The most pressing being
the electric and the phone.

43:12.616 --> 43:14.539
I got an extension till Monday.

43:14.618 --> 43:16.996
It's okay.
I'll just figure something out.

43:22.209 --> 43:25.304
Hey, hon. Sorry.
I should be about ten more minutes...

43:27.464 --> 43:30.058
No. No, no, no, no.
Can you drive? Okay.

43:30.133 --> 43:32.602
Get in the car and go
straight to the hospital.

43:32.677 --> 43:35.476
I will meet you there.
No, get straight to the hospital.

43:35.555 --> 43:38.559

Nicole Morris, sex therapist.
Who am I speaking with?

44:53.258 --> 44:55.306
Hey, I'm Mike.

44:55.385 --> 44:59.015
Are you okay, Mike?
Do you need someone to talk to?

44:59.097 --> 45:01.145
I've been better.

45:01.224 --> 45:03.067
My wife left me.

45:05.061 --> 45:07.735
She, uh, she took
all my furniture.

45:07.814 --> 45:10.317
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

45:10.400 --> 45:11.822
Yeah.

45:14.362 --> 45:16.660
At least she left me
my alligator.

45:16.740 --> 45:19.835
You know my alligator
is 49 years old?

45:19.910 --> 45:22.413
Wow. So cool for a pet.

45:22.495 --> 45:24.589
Actually not
for an alligator.

45:26.833 --> 45:29.382
You don't sound that old, Mike.

45:29.461 --> 45:32.840
Me? No. No, I'm, uh,

45:32.923 --> 45:35.597
I'm in my prime.

45:37.928 --> 45:40.022
Is that your baby crying?

45:41.765 --> 45:44.359
No. That's the, uh,

45:44.434 --> 45:48.189
that's the office next door.
It's a pediatrics therapist.

45:48.271 --> 45:51.320
A little late for a baby to
be at the doctor, isn't it?

45:53.693 --> 45:55.946
Tell me what's
on your mind, Mike.

46:05.163 --> 46:07.461
I don't like to be alone.

46:07.540 --> 46:10.419
It feels better now that you're
talking to someone, doesn't it?

46:10.502 --> 46:12.504
Yeah.

46:13.964 --> 46:15.637
Hey, you think
we could meet up?

46:17.133 --> 46:18.885
Possibly.

46:18.969 --> 46:20.892
Mike, do you have
a credit card?

46:20.971 --> 46:22.814
Yeah, hang on.

46:30.981 --> 46:33.359
Immediate
medical attention.

46:33.441 --> 46:36.240
I'd like to encourage you to
fake yourselves to our clinic.

46:36.319 --> 46:38.697
It's just two blocks away
on Main Street. Please.

46:38.780 --> 46:41.033
If you have a stomach
ache, a sprained ankle,

46:41.116 --> 46:44.086
anything that does not need
immediate medical attention...

46:44.160 --> 46:46.583
Pete, don't.
You're gonna get fired.

46:46.663 --> 46:48.916
They're not gonna
kick me out today.

46:48.999 --> 46:50.967
What's going on?
Who's getting kicked out?

46:51.042 --> 46:52.965
Welcome to the hospital.

46:53.044 --> 46:54.762
I'm sorry.

46:54.838 --> 46:57.466
They canceled
my insurance today.

46:57.549 --> 47:00.223
Pre-existing conditions.

47:00.301 --> 47:03.771
What kind? Propensity to be
stabbed by sharp objects?

47:03.847 --> 47:06.600
Some goddamn thing.

47:06.683 --> 47:08.526
Let me go talk to somebody.

47:08.601 --> 47:10.854
No, no, no. Please, it's okay.
I'll take care of it.

47:10.937 --> 47:14.111
Pete, why don't you
get the boxes for him?

47:14.190 --> 47:16.693
David, Kia, you go
help him out, okay?

47:16.776 --> 47:18.244
Come on, guys.

47:18.319 --> 47:19.992
Hey, guys.

47:24.784 --> 47:27.207
Why don't you let me
talk to somebody, Vicky?

47:27.287 --> 47:28.960
You okay?

47:35.336 --> 47:36.679
Thank you.

47:36.755 --> 47:39.053
Sure. You all right?

47:42.677 --> 47:43.974
What about you?

47:46.765 --> 47:50.815
Oh, that's... Yeah.
I, uh, I'm good.

47:52.062 --> 47:53.359
Jill, this is Mike.

47:53.438 --> 47:55.065
Hello.

48:00.779 --> 48:04.409
So strange being on the
other side of things.

48:04.491 --> 48:07.415
Having all the floor
nurses stand over me.

48:08.787 --> 48:11.836
I trained some of them.

48:11.915 --> 48:16.045
They got these crazy patterns
on their shirts these days,

48:16.127 --> 48:18.846
like supposed to calm
the patients but...

48:18.922 --> 48:21.391
it ends up making you
feel dizzy.

48:24.219 --> 48:25.846
Mm.

48:33.103 --> 48:35.572
So, you said you
had something for me.

48:39.609 --> 48:43.159
You know, it's true what they say
about the stages you go through.

48:44.781 --> 48:48.160
Denial, anger, acceptance,

48:48.243 --> 48:50.291
blah, blah, blah.

48:52.664 --> 48:56.714
But it doesn't happen quite as
cleanly as the pamphlets tell you.

48:58.461 --> 49:00.134
In reality,

49:01.297 --> 49:03.174
it's a stew.

49:05.176 --> 49:08.055
Everything happens
all at the same time.

49:11.474 --> 49:12.691
Just because

49:14.561 --> 49:17.030
you can't really get
over the dark parts,

49:17.105 --> 49:20.655
it doesn't mean you can't
get to the good ones.

49:28.074 --> 49:32.170
Sometimes the brightest light
comes from the darkest places.

49:40.420 --> 49:42.798
There you go.

49:42.881 --> 49:44.758
Thank you.

49:44.841 --> 49:46.309
Where did you get this?

49:46.384 --> 49:48.478
Don't worry where
we got them from.

50:11.242 --> 50:13.495
Hey.

50:13.578 --> 50:17.253
Thompson Needles is coming out with
their own line of safety needle.

50:17.332 --> 50:20.461
You think they're threatened
by Safety Point or what?

50:20.543 --> 50:24.468
These are internal documents from United
Medical Health Supplies proving...

50:24.547 --> 50:28.518
Mike, stop it. Kim had to go
to the hospital last night.

50:28.593 --> 50:30.140
What?

50:30.220 --> 50:31.847
She's fine. False alarm.

50:31.930 --> 50:33.648
Is everything okay?

50:33.723 --> 50:36.146
No, everything's not okay.
Our insurance lapsed.

50:36.226 --> 50:38.979
What do you mean
our insurance lapsed?

50:39.062 --> 50:43.112
You told Sylvia to pay for you to attend
the United Medical Health Supplies dinner

50:43.191 --> 50:48.118
from the firm's account, and that you
would pay the insurance bill later.

50:48.196 --> 50:50.574
I'm sorry. It's not how I
meant for it to happen.

50:50.657 --> 50:54.252
That's not how you meant for it to happen.
Kim is pregnant, Mike.

50:57.622 --> 51:00.375
Look,

51:00.458 --> 51:03.428
I don't see how we can
possibly continue the case.

51:03.503 --> 51:06.723
Mike, we agreed that
we would drop this.

51:06.798 --> 51:09.847
I agreed to take in another firm.
I never agreed to drop anything.

51:09.926 --> 51:12.270
I've called 50 firms
and no one will touch it.

51:12.345 --> 51:14.473
I'm not dropping the case.

51:14.555 --> 51:16.523
That's not your
decision to make.

51:16.599 --> 51:19.102
Do you wanna call
Dancort or should I?

51:22.397 --> 51:24.320
It's too big, Mike.

51:27.652 --> 51:32.203
I have Senator O'Reilly calling from
Washington, D.C. for you, Mike.

51:37.537 --> 51:38.880
Hello?

51:46.838 --> 51:49.637
Then the GPO, in our case
United Medical Health Supplies

51:49.716 --> 51:52.219
will draw up an exclusive
contract with Thompson Needles,

51:52.302 --> 51:54.896
who in turn give them a
kickback for every needle sold.

51:54.971 --> 51:57.440
Boxing out any competition
regardless of how superior

51:57.515 --> 51:59.938
or how much safer
their product is.

52:00.018 --> 52:03.318
If Thompson Needles is gonna come out
with a safe needle they'd have to retool,

52:03.396 --> 52:06.900
recast the molding. They'd have to
replace their entire assembly line.

52:06.983 --> 52:10.658
Something they're not interested in doing
because of the high upfront costs.

52:10.737 --> 52:13.081
Hm. Ingenious.

52:13.156 --> 52:15.784
This is a
tremendous innovation.

52:15.867 --> 52:20.873
As you know, I've been addressing safety
issues for hospital workers for years.

52:20.955 --> 52:24.004
I'm intrigued by your product, Mr.
Dancort, to say the least...

52:24.083 --> 52:26.802
Thank you.

52:26.878 --> 52:30.007
This is a bill proposal mandating
the use of sound needles.

52:30.089 --> 52:32.091
We're in the process of
circulating a petition

52:32.175 --> 52:34.928
in every single hospital
across the United States,

52:35.011 --> 52:38.481
so we can mobilize nurses' unions
an associations to help you lobby.

52:38.556 --> 52:41.400
Right. We have some interest
from some financial institutions

52:41.476 --> 52:43.695
regarding investment packages,

52:43.770 --> 52:47.900
and we're gonna try and get them in
every hospital across the country.

52:47.982 --> 52:53.284
Senator, you're giving us the
impetus to safe thousands of lives.

52:59.869 --> 53:02.372
Incredible.
That was incredible.

53:02.455 --> 53:03.798
Great job.

53:03.873 --> 53:05.875
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

53:05.958 --> 53:07.881
Are you happy?

53:13.674 --> 53:17.099
Excuse me, Mr. Weiss.
Could I speak with you for just a second?

53:17.178 --> 53:18.430
Yeah.

53:21.599 --> 53:22.646
Senator.

53:22.725 --> 53:24.944
Mr. Weiss.

53:25.019 --> 53:28.819
I wanted to let you know how much I
appreciate you and your colleagues

53:28.898 --> 53:31.868
bringing this to my attention.

53:34.237 --> 53:37.992
As I said, the safety and
well-being of health care workers

53:38.074 --> 53:40.668
has been high on my
agenda from day one,

53:40.743 --> 53:45.749
and we also agree that urgent
action is what is called for.

53:45.832 --> 53:48.676
That's great. It's...

53:48.751 --> 53:52.221
it's just-it's good to meet someone who
is on board to fight the good fight.

53:52.296 --> 53:54.264
It would be an honor
to offer my support,

53:54.340 --> 53:57.093
but only if you drop this case

53:57.176 --> 54:00.680
and let Mr. Dancort
team up with another firm.

54:07.019 --> 54:10.319
The cocaine under your nose.

54:15.987 --> 54:17.330
That's, um...

54:23.703 --> 54:26.172
I'm not judging you, Mike.

54:26.247 --> 54:29.797
You're not the first person to lobby
a Senator hopped up on narcotics

54:29.876 --> 54:32.550
and I'm sure you're not even the
first person to do so today,

54:32.628 --> 54:36.258
but there's absolutely no way we can
put you before the House Committee

54:36.340 --> 54:38.513
let alone the Senate.

54:38.593 --> 54:40.345
Wait, just...

54:47.768 --> 54:51.318
My client has approached every law firm in Texas.
They've all said no.

54:51.397 --> 54:53.866
He's broke.

54:53.941 --> 54:55.318
This is...

54:57.612 --> 54:59.831
This is a major antitrust case.

54:59.906 --> 55:02.580
You know the type of money and
muscle that goes into it.

55:02.658 --> 55:04.877
Mr. Dancort does
not have the money

55:04.952 --> 55:07.705
to sit across from the receptionist
at some of these firms.

55:07.788 --> 55:12.760
My partner and I are the only ones
who are willing to take this risk.

55:12.835 --> 55:15.554
We believe in this case.

55:15.630 --> 55:17.758
We believe in it.

55:23.638 --> 55:25.515
Give me a chance.

55:25.598 --> 55:28.852
I'll go back to Houston.
I'll get myself cleaned up.

55:32.813 --> 55:35.282
Okay.

55:35.358 --> 55:38.111
But know this.

55:38.194 --> 55:41.038
You only get one chance.
Don't fuck it up.

55:44.575 --> 55:46.669
Understood.

55:48.579 --> 55:50.957
They're talking to
fucking Senators now.

55:51.040 --> 55:55.216
They're knocking on doors,
chickens with their heads cut off.

55:55.294 --> 55:58.639
We need to fix
this now, Nathaniel.

55:58.714 --> 56:00.136
I'll take care of it.

56:00.216 --> 56:02.310
They're losing patience.

56:02.385 --> 56:05.685
I just need a bit more time.

56:05.763 --> 56:07.686
I'll try.

56:07.765 --> 56:11.065
But you need to hurry.

56:11.143 --> 56:13.862
Or it's not gonna
be good for any of us.

56:48.764 --> 56:50.562
This is
a waste of time.

56:50.641 --> 56:52.109
Mike.

56:52.184 --> 56:54.232
Show some respect, huh?

56:57.898 --> 57:01.402
I'll show some respect by winning the
case that put her in the ground.

57:02.695 --> 57:04.288
Fuck this.

57:13.122 --> 57:14.874
Fuck.

57:14.957 --> 57:16.925
Come on.

58:35.121 --> 58:37.465
The reason you...

58:37.540 --> 58:40.794
The reason why you should invest in
Safety Point is because it's safe

58:40.876 --> 58:43.971
and it's affective.
It's a life saving...

58:44.046 --> 58:48.426
it's a life saving device.
It's a life saving device.

58:48.509 --> 58:50.511
It's a life saving device.

58:50.594 --> 58:52.267
Your involvement...

58:54.682 --> 58:56.400
Are you all right, Mike?

58:56.475 --> 58:58.352
Yeah, I'm fine.

58:58.436 --> 59:00.154
You want something?

59:24.253 --> 59:26.927
I was always more of a
tinkerer than a businessman.

59:27.006 --> 59:29.634
It's how I thought
about myself anyway.

59:29.717 --> 59:33.017
My first office was in the
corner of a bicycle shop.

59:33.095 --> 59:36.850
My first customer was an amputee
with an artificial leg.

59:38.184 --> 59:40.312
Hi. Good evening.

59:40.394 --> 59:43.364
I'm Paul Danzinger, and, uh,
I'd like to welcome you

59:43.439 --> 59:45.658
on behalf of my partner,
Michael Weiss,

59:45.733 --> 59:48.907
and of course the man who really
brought us all together tonight,

59:48.986 --> 59:51.489
Mr. Jeffrey Dancort.

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:17.565
I've been doing this
a long time, you know.

01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.314
Long, long, long time.

01:00:20.392 --> 01:00:23.646
And what I've come to realize is
that there's just people out there

01:00:23.729 --> 01:00:26.653
that all they wanna
do is fuck you up.

01:00:28.275 --> 01:00:31.870
Right. You know what
I'm talking about.

01:00:31.946 --> 01:00:34.540
So, on this one I just
decided to say fuck it.

01:00:34.615 --> 01:00:39.416
'Cause you know what?
A good idea is a good idea.

01:00:39.495 --> 01:00:42.294
We're talking about
people's lives here.

01:00:42.373 --> 01:00:45.502
Saving people's lives.

01:00:45.584 --> 01:00:50.090
This girl is dead because of
what we're talking about here.

01:00:50.172 --> 01:00:53.221
So, who gives a shit
about the bottom line?

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.598
Well, I'll tell you
who gives a shit.

01:00:55.678 --> 01:00:58.727
The goddamn miserable
sorry ass motherfuckers

01:00:58.806 --> 01:01:01.559
who won't let the
hospitals use my needle.

01:01:01.642 --> 01:01:04.771
None of us in here might
even make ever a dime.

01:01:04.854 --> 01:01:07.198
The point is,

01:01:07.273 --> 01:01:11.574
that it's... The point
is Safety Point.

01:01:13.779 --> 01:01:16.578
And I want you all to

01:01:16.657 --> 01:01:18.250
think about helping us out.

01:01:18.325 --> 01:01:21.579
It's just a good thing
to be part of and...

01:01:21.662 --> 01:01:24.211
Thanks for being here.

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:25.963
Good night.

01:01:27.626 --> 01:01:30.550
Thank you very much
for coming and...

01:01:43.142 --> 01:01:45.270
How are you doing, Mike?

01:01:45.352 --> 01:01:47.650
I'm sorry.

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:52.493
Oh, Shit, Mike.

01:01:55.613 --> 01:01:58.412
People don't bring
checkbooks to these things.

01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:02.248
I can't do this any more.

01:02:03.746 --> 01:02:07.171
Paul, let's go home.

01:02:17.217 --> 01:02:19.094
Hey, Sylvia.

01:02:19.178 --> 01:02:21.647
Call ahead and tell them I
need an anesthesiologist.

01:02:21.722 --> 01:02:25.397
Put naltrexone on.
And I want the full treatment.

01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:28.070
I want the implant
under the abdomen.

01:02:28.145 --> 01:02:31.240
Not the posterior...
Not the posterior rear.

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:34.819
I don't want anything in my
ass that doesn't have to be.

01:02:37.529 --> 01:02:40.533
Collapsed veins, infection of the heart
lining and valves,

01:02:40.616 --> 01:02:44.120
few abscesses.
The beginning of liver disease.

01:02:44.203 --> 01:02:48.003
Minor pulmonary complications and
what could be the start of pneumonia.

01:02:48.082 --> 01:02:49.800
Christ.

01:02:49.875 --> 01:02:52.424
Typical.
He's going through withdrawal.

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:54.881
I had no idea. I mean, I...

01:02:54.964 --> 01:02:57.717
I know he's taking some
painpills for his leg,

01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:59.222
but I didn't...

01:02:59.301 --> 01:03:02.100
He's a pretty heavy user.

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:04.978
I guess the good thing
I reactivated the insurance.

01:03:05.057 --> 01:03:08.903
By the way, the treatment he
requested is gonna run about 25,000,

01:03:08.978 --> 01:03:13.199
and it's not covered by insurance.
Just a heads up.

01:03:13.273 --> 01:03:14.900
Great.

01:03:50.978 --> 01:03:52.696
What the...

01:03:59.153 --> 01:04:00.370
Hey.

01:04:00.446 --> 01:04:01.914
Hey. You got my clothes?

01:04:01.989 --> 01:04:04.412
Yeah.

01:04:04.491 --> 01:04:08.246
Whoa. Hey, don't you want me to get someone
to checkout? I'm gonna find a nurse.

01:04:08.328 --> 01:04:11.298
That's a great idea.
We're always underestimating nurses.

01:04:11.373 --> 01:04:13.626
I'll be right
with you, Mr. Weiss.

01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:16.963
You wouldn't happen to be a member of
the nursing association, would you?

01:04:17.046 --> 01:04:20.391
I'm standing in front the the
Houston Community National Hospital

01:04:20.466 --> 01:04:24.016
with a few hundred nurses and assorted
health care workers in protest.

01:04:24.094 --> 01:04:27.189
Joining me now is Karen Brown,
President of the Texas Nurse...

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:31.144
Every needle stick accident costs the hospital
thousands of dollars in follow up testing.

01:04:31.226 --> 01:04:35.322
If it's with an infected needle, it's
between 500,000 and $1 million per case.

01:04:35.397 --> 01:04:39.618
In this country there are roughly one
million needle stick accidents a year.

01:04:39.693 --> 01:04:41.866
Think about that.
You do the math.

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:44.824
We're fighting for the right of
every citizen to live in a country

01:04:44.907 --> 01:04:46.830
that values human
life over profits.

01:04:46.909 --> 01:04:48.331
Mr. Weiss, the hospital...

01:05:02.216 --> 01:05:04.093
Senator O'Reilly's office.

01:05:04.176 --> 01:05:06.474
This is attorney Mike
Weiss for the Senator.

01:05:06.553 --> 01:05:09.181
Hi, Mr. Weiss. She just ended a meeting.
Can I take a message?

01:05:09.264 --> 01:05:10.641
Sure.

01:05:14.394 --> 01:05:17.318
Why are these here?
They were supposed to go out yesterday.

01:05:17.397 --> 01:05:19.240
They sent it back.

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:21.569
What the hell is that?
I thought we had a contract.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:23.950
Tell the Senator to return
my call as soon as possible.

01:05:24.029 --> 01:05:26.532
It's regarding the San
Antonio Memorial Hospital

01:05:26.615 --> 01:05:29.710
canceling their contract
with Safety Point Syringes.

01:05:29.785 --> 01:05:32.208
The CEO of San Antonio
Memorial hospital

01:05:32.287 --> 01:05:36.258
has been invited to sit on the board
of United Medical Health Supplies.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:39.712
Yeah, you think she'd like to hear
that in the news or return my call?

01:05:39.795 --> 01:05:42.799
Please, have her call me back.
This is attorney Mike Weiss.

01:05:49.471 --> 01:05:52.645
I'm about to book a flight to DC.
This is bullshit.

01:05:52.724 --> 01:05:56.024
The Senator's chief aid called this morning.
She's tabling the issue.

01:05:56.103 --> 01:05:57.980
Tabling the issue?

01:05:58.063 --> 01:06:00.942
What the fuck does that mean?
I'm going down there.

01:06:01.024 --> 01:06:04.119
United Medical Health Supplies just
made a very generous contribution

01:06:04.194 --> 01:06:06.697
to the Senator's
reelection campaign.

01:06:16.874 --> 01:06:18.501
What's this?

01:06:18.584 --> 01:06:21.679
Kim gave birth last
night to a baby girl.

01:06:21.753 --> 01:06:23.755
Six pounds, eight ounces.

01:06:23.839 --> 01:06:26.934
Sam. She's beautiful.

01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:30.058
Congratulations.

01:06:30.137 --> 01:06:32.435
I'll be home with
them if you need me.

01:06:34.057 --> 01:06:36.480
What are we gonna do
about the Senator?

01:08:11.571 --> 01:08:13.323
Nicole Morris, sex therapist.

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:44.188
I like sex therapy.

01:08:56.658 --> 01:08:58.501
Nice to meet you.

01:09:13.425 --> 01:09:17.645
She creeps me the fuck out.

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:19.939
I should say something, right?

01:09:20.015 --> 01:09:21.392
Probably.

01:09:21.475 --> 01:09:23.853
You wanna be the one?

01:09:23.935 --> 01:09:25.232
No.

01:09:25.312 --> 01:09:27.656
Me neither.

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:30.904
Oh, hey, thanks for being
flexible attending the case.

01:09:30.984 --> 01:09:33.362
I'm a little behind.

01:09:33.444 --> 01:09:36.540
It's okay.
You don't have to worry about it.

01:09:36.615 --> 01:09:39.960
I know. I'm just gonna check a few
facts and then I'll get it to you.

01:09:40.035 --> 01:09:42.287
No, I mean, we don't need
it from you any more.

01:09:42.371 --> 01:09:47.127
Look, I didn't... I didn't wanna
bring this up here but...

01:09:49.044 --> 01:09:52.264
I'm really sorry.
My firm won't let me subcontract

01:09:52.339 --> 01:09:54.136
any more work to you guys.

01:09:54.216 --> 01:09:56.810
Not while you're working
on the Safety Point case.

01:09:56.885 --> 01:09:58.808
Are you serious?

01:10:00.389 --> 01:10:01.982
I'm sorry.

01:10:02.057 --> 01:10:05.436
I mean, you can
keep the retainer.

01:10:05.519 --> 01:10:07.817
I wish there was something
else I could do, but...

01:10:07.896 --> 01:10:10.024
I understand.

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.197
Excuse me.

01:10:14.945 --> 01:10:17.414
I'm not sure that's
gonna work for us.

01:10:17.489 --> 01:10:18.991
Well, yeah, I don't...

01:10:21.118 --> 01:10:23.291
Okay.

01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:25.839
Let me talk it over with
my partner and my client.

01:10:25.914 --> 01:10:28.167
I'll get back
to you in an hour.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:31.003
All right.

01:10:31.086 --> 01:10:35.011
That was Price. He wants us to
come out to his house tomorrow.

01:10:35.090 --> 01:10:38.139
His house? Why?

01:10:38.218 --> 01:10:41.768
You said that we'd settle by Christmas.
Maybe you're right.

01:10:44.891 --> 01:10:46.814
I gotta call Dancort.

01:11:00.282 --> 01:11:02.660
Mike!

01:11:10.834 --> 01:11:13.087
Hand me that bag.

01:11:15.964 --> 01:11:17.386
Mike, come on.

01:11:17.466 --> 01:11:19.969
Just give me the fucking bag!

01:11:54.753 --> 01:11:56.926
Gentlemen.
Thanks for coming out.

01:11:57.005 --> 01:11:59.804
Give me a few minutes to wash up.
I'll be right with you.

01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:02.181
Stephanie will show you
the way to the library.

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.013
If you need anything, she'll be
happy to get it for you, okay?

01:12:09.935 --> 01:12:11.858
Right this way, gentlemen.

01:12:13.563 --> 01:12:16.612
Dial nine if you need
to get an outside line.

01:12:16.691 --> 01:12:18.944
And I'll be just down the
hall there to the left

01:12:19.027 --> 01:12:21.576
if there's anything else I
can do for you gentlemen.

01:12:21.655 --> 01:12:22.952
We're fine, thank you.

01:12:23.031 --> 01:12:24.408
Great.

01:12:24.491 --> 01:12:26.459
You got any fresh
squeezed juice?

01:12:26.535 --> 01:12:28.208
Uh, I can check.

01:12:28.286 --> 01:12:30.709
Orange is fine.
Grapefruit is preferable.

01:12:30.789 --> 01:12:32.962
I'll see what I can do.

01:12:33.041 --> 01:12:35.635
Where's your bathroom?

01:12:35.710 --> 01:12:37.462
It's right here.

01:12:50.392 --> 01:12:52.770
How long do we have
to fucking wait?

01:12:55.772 --> 01:12:58.776
Gentlemen. It's nice, isn't it?

01:12:58.858 --> 01:13:00.906
Fresh air.

01:13:04.239 --> 01:13:07.163
Mm. Okay.

01:13:07.242 --> 01:13:09.586
Let's get down to business.

01:13:11.371 --> 01:13:13.499
First of all,

01:13:13.582 --> 01:13:16.461
thank you for coming all the way out here.
It's much appreciated.

01:13:16.543 --> 01:13:18.762
Now, putting aside

01:13:18.837 --> 01:13:22.137
the fact that Safety Point Syringes
is having financial difficulties,

01:13:22.215 --> 01:13:24.934
one of our manufacturing clients
is ready to put an offer

01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:27.354
for it which I think you're
gonna find satisfactory.

01:13:27.429 --> 01:13:30.558
Where's that girl?
The girl that showed us in?

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:32.358
I'm not sure, Mr. Weiss.

01:13:32.434 --> 01:13:34.152
Waiting on some juice.

01:13:34.227 --> 01:13:36.571
I'm sure she'll bring it
when she can.

01:13:36.646 --> 01:13:39.900
Like I said, one of our manufacturing
clients is interested in your company

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:42.406
and the needle and has
been for quite some time.

01:13:42.485 --> 01:13:46.535
This generous manufacturer wouldn't
happen to be Thompson Needles, would it?

01:13:46.615 --> 01:13:51.041
They would like to remain anonymous
until there's an accepted offer.

01:13:51.119 --> 01:13:54.498
And this anonymous client would then
own the patent to Safety Point?

01:13:54.581 --> 01:13:57.551
That's right. My client is
interested in purchasing the equity

01:13:57.626 --> 01:13:59.924
that comes from Safety
Point Syringes.

01:14:00.003 --> 01:14:03.223
Would there be a contractual provision
guaranteeing a certain production

01:14:03.298 --> 01:14:05.346
and distribution of the
Safety Point Syringe?

01:14:05.425 --> 01:14:08.349
Once my client purchases
Safety Point Syringes,

01:14:08.428 --> 01:14:11.227
they'll have the right to
do with it as they see fit.

01:14:11.306 --> 01:14:14.731
And what do they see fit?

01:14:14.809 --> 01:14:16.732
Mr. Dancort,

01:14:16.811 --> 01:14:20.816
my client is prepared to make
a more than generous offer.

01:14:20.899 --> 01:14:24.324
This is great. You know your
client is in direct violation

01:14:24.402 --> 01:14:26.905
and federal and state
antitrust laws.

01:14:26.988 --> 01:14:30.492
You damn well know you won't win
this case if you go to trial.

01:14:32.369 --> 01:14:35.589
You are a brilliant
engineer, Mr. Dancort.

01:14:35.664 --> 01:14:38.668
Try applying some of that
towards your business sense.

01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:42.254
I didn't sacrifice everything because
I was looking for a big payday.

01:14:42.337 --> 01:14:45.216
I just want my needles
in those hospitals.

01:14:45.298 --> 01:14:47.551
I'm sorry, Mr.
Dancort. I truly am.

01:14:47.634 --> 01:14:51.514
I won't take any pleasure
in seeing you ruined.

01:14:51.596 --> 01:14:54.896
That proposal is only
valid for three days.

01:14:54.974 --> 01:14:56.976
No amendments, no negotiation.

01:14:57.060 --> 01:14:59.904
Now, gentlemen, I have taken
up enough of your Saturday.

01:14:59.979 --> 01:15:03.404
Stephanie will see you out.
I look forward to your response.

01:15:49.529 --> 01:15:50.951
We have to take it.

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:52.532
Excuse me?

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.038
The offer. We have
to take the money.

01:15:55.118 --> 01:15:56.870
What do you mean?

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:59.126
That offer at Dancort
Is not fair.

01:15:59.205 --> 01:16:02.084
They made the offer 'cause they know
they can't win. They're scared.

01:16:02.167 --> 01:16:03.840
They're not scared, Mike.

01:16:03.918 --> 01:16:05.636
They're scared we'll
take it to trial.

01:16:16.014 --> 01:16:18.733
Do you even really care

01:16:18.808 --> 01:16:22.904
if Safety Point needles
end up in hospitals?

01:16:22.979 --> 01:16:25.653
No, seriously, I-I'm
asking you a question.

01:16:25.732 --> 01:16:28.030
Do I care? Yes.
People are dying.

01:16:28.109 --> 01:16:30.453
That's what you care about?
People dying?

01:16:30.528 --> 01:16:32.246
Really?

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.833
We're taking the settlement.

01:16:35.909 --> 01:16:38.412
No, we're not.

01:16:38.495 --> 01:16:41.544
You want Dancort to walk away from
millions of dollars, and then what?

01:16:41.623 --> 01:16:44.547
What happens to him when we
go to court years from now

01:16:44.626 --> 01:16:46.845
and he's lost his
business and his house?

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:49.719
And then, then after all
that we lose the case?

01:16:49.798 --> 01:16:51.050
We won't lose the case.

01:16:51.132 --> 01:16:52.850
Okay, fine, we don't lose.

01:16:52.926 --> 01:16:55.224
How do you want us
to survive until then, Mike?

01:16:55.303 --> 01:16:57.772
We are broke. Broke, broke.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.270
We have three weeks of overhead left
In the bank.

01:17:00.350 --> 01:17:03.103
United Medical Health Supplies
has pretty much paid off

01:17:03.186 --> 01:17:07.236
or pressured everyone in the United States
of America from giving us any new work!

01:17:07.315 --> 01:17:10.569
How are you gonna go and rally
people behind Jeffrey in court

01:17:10.652 --> 01:17:15.408
when you don't have a phone to call
them and to tell them where to show up?

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:17.333
I'm ending this...

01:17:17.408 --> 01:17:19.786
I'm not ending shit.
I'll take a loan on my house.

01:17:19.869 --> 01:17:21.837
You are so fucking delusional.

01:17:21.913 --> 01:17:24.416
You're a big fucking pussy
who'd rather chase ambulances

01:17:24.499 --> 01:17:26.046
then use the law
to save peoples lives.

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:27.547
So you care about
people's lives?

01:17:27.627 --> 01:17:29.721
Yeah, I do.

01:17:29.796 --> 01:17:32.424
Whose? The troop of hookers you
pay to hang out with? Your wife?

01:17:32.507 --> 01:17:35.852
Fuck you, Paul. Like you really give a
shit about those pathetic scam artists.

01:17:35.927 --> 01:17:37.850
We do neck braces
and fucking crutches.

01:17:37.929 --> 01:17:40.227
Not just the settlements
they bring in, right?

01:17:40.306 --> 01:17:42.809
You just wanna win.
That is all you've ever cared about.

01:17:42.892 --> 01:17:47.022
At least I have the courage
to lose for what's right!

01:17:54.737 --> 01:17:58.287
I'll call Dancort and tell him you're
no longer involved with the case.

01:18:01.452 --> 01:18:03.580
I'll walk from here.

01:18:31.441 --> 01:18:32.613
Hey, man.

01:18:32.692 --> 01:18:34.285
How are you doing?

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.907
Thanks.

01:18:45.496 --> 01:18:47.339
Excuse me.

01:18:47.415 --> 01:18:49.509
I'm all set, man.

01:18:49.584 --> 01:18:53.179
Mr. Weiss, I used to work for
Thompson Needle Manufacturers.

01:18:53.254 --> 01:18:55.598
Then go fuck yourself.

01:18:55.673 --> 01:18:58.096
I was a friend of Vicky's.

01:18:59.677 --> 01:19:01.520
She asked me
to come talk to you.

01:19:03.389 --> 01:19:05.562
Thought it might be helpful.

01:19:07.143 --> 01:19:08.941
You got a car?

01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:11.114
Yeah. Follow me.

01:19:12.482 --> 01:19:13.904
It's right over here.

01:19:26.371 --> 01:19:29.420
You see, up until the 1960s.

01:19:29.499 --> 01:19:32.002
Needle syringes
were made of glass

01:19:32.085 --> 01:19:35.385
which hospitals
sterilized with heat.

01:19:35.463 --> 01:19:39.513
Thompson Needle Manufacturers refused
to switch to plastic needles

01:19:39.592 --> 01:19:41.811
despite the money they'd make

01:19:41.886 --> 01:19:45.015
because plastic needles
can't be sterilized.

01:19:47.016 --> 01:19:49.644
The founder of the
company, James Thompson,

01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:57.486
he was quoted to saying, "We'll switch
to plastic needles over my dead body."

01:19:58.820 --> 01:20:02.575
Sure enough. In 1966,

01:20:02.657 --> 01:20:05.581
the year he died,
Thompson Manufacturers

01:20:05.660 --> 01:20:08.288
switched to plastic needles.

01:20:08.371 --> 01:20:10.294
Within ten years,

01:20:10.373 --> 01:20:13.593
hepatitis C and AIDS
were on the map.

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:21.267
They knew that they'd be responsible for
spreading epidemics around the world.

01:20:41.738 --> 01:20:43.866
This tape

01:20:43.948 --> 01:20:47.202
has footage taken by a Peace
Corps worker in Nigeria.

01:20:53.958 --> 01:20:55.631
Look.

01:20:55.710 --> 01:20:57.678
You see those kids?

01:21:01.382 --> 01:21:03.635
Children.

01:21:07.722 --> 01:21:11.067
They get paid pennies to bring
used needles and syringes

01:21:11.142 --> 01:21:13.565
to local pharmacies.

01:21:15.730 --> 01:21:18.279
The clinics save on health
care by reusing needles

01:21:18.357 --> 01:21:20.359
up to 200 times.

01:21:22.070 --> 01:21:25.540
This is what's
going on everywhere.

01:21:25.615 --> 01:21:28.494
Thompson Needle Manufacturers,

01:21:28.576 --> 01:21:31.045
they're not only
not acting on this,

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.623
they're actually suppressing
knowledge of it.

01:21:33.706 --> 01:21:36.926
The plastic syringe is the root

01:21:37.001 --> 01:21:41.427
of the AIDS epidemic all across
Africa and Russia and India.

01:21:41.506 --> 01:21:43.975
I'm sorry, they made an
offer to buy Safety Point.

01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:46.178
We're advising
our client to take it.

01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:48.433
Oh, come on, Mike!

01:21:48.513 --> 01:21:52.108
You know if they buy it,
they're not gonna use it!

01:21:53.935 --> 01:21:55.858
That needle

01:21:55.937 --> 01:21:58.781
can save more than nurses here.

01:21:58.856 --> 01:22:03.407
It can save millions of
lives around the world.

01:22:03.486 --> 01:22:06.456
Yeah, well I'm just
a personal injury lawyer.

01:22:08.574 --> 01:22:11.043
Not exactly in the best
place to go around

01:22:11.119 --> 01:22:13.542
saving people's lives.

01:22:23.422 --> 01:22:25.299
You know something, Mike?

01:22:27.677 --> 01:22:30.351
Sometimes the brightest light

01:22:30.429 --> 01:22:33.057
comes from the darkest places.

01:23:36.871 --> 01:23:38.965
Get it before
it wakes the baby.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.758
Hello?

01:23:40.833 --> 01:23:43.302
Jesus Christ, Mike, you're
gonna wake the baby.

01:23:43.377 --> 01:23:46.426
I'm hanging up now, all right?
We can talk about it tomorrow.

01:23:46.505 --> 01:23:48.849
Okay. Sorry.

01:23:52.345 --> 01:23:53.938
Is she up?

01:24:25.711 --> 01:24:27.509
I like people that are nuts.

01:24:27.588 --> 01:24:29.966
Keeps things interesting.

01:24:30.049 --> 01:24:33.644
Do you know anything about the
original glass needle manufacturers?

01:24:33.719 --> 01:24:36.518
Or anything about
plastic syringes?

01:24:38.307 --> 01:24:41.481
You know, Michael?
Everyone goes to law school

01:24:41.560 --> 01:24:44.939
to become a good guy.
To fight the good fight for justice.

01:24:45.022 --> 01:24:47.366
Is that what you did?

01:24:47.441 --> 01:24:48.909
Yes, I did.

01:24:48.985 --> 01:24:50.612
How is that working out?

01:24:53.614 --> 01:24:56.538
Do you remember the big
tobacco law suits?

01:24:56.617 --> 01:24:58.711
Of course.

01:24:58.786 --> 01:25:03.087
Seven CEOs under oath lying in
front of Congress and on camera.

01:25:03.165 --> 01:25:05.463
And every state in the
Union suing them, right?

01:25:05.543 --> 01:25:07.045
That's right.

01:25:07.128 --> 01:25:09.347
You remember what
happened after that?

01:25:09.422 --> 01:25:12.801
Yeah. We shelled out a $165 billion settlement.
That's what happened.

01:25:12.883 --> 01:25:16.558
No, nothing happened.
Cigarettes are everywhere.

01:25:16.637 --> 01:25:20.358
You know, new teenagers
start smoking every day.

01:25:20.433 --> 01:25:23.232
Billions of people
smoking worldwide.

01:25:23.311 --> 01:25:26.235
Millions of people
dying every year.

01:25:26.314 --> 01:25:28.032
Nothing happened.

01:25:28.107 --> 01:25:31.577
Big tobacco got a spanking.
Slap on the wrist.

01:25:31.652 --> 01:25:34.155
And the y were right back
to business as usual.

01:25:36.657 --> 01:25:41.959
Hm. I assume you came here tonight to
try convince me to do the right thing.

01:25:42.038 --> 01:25:44.211
You know, I'd look in your eye

01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:48.295
and I'd go, "Oh, my
God, you're right!"

01:25:48.377 --> 01:25:50.004
Then what?

01:25:53.341 --> 01:25:55.810
Guys like me are
like cafeteria trays.

01:25:55.885 --> 01:25:59.185
Take one off the top and there's
another one right underneath it.

01:26:01.349 --> 01:26:04.102
Now I bet you
spent your whole life

01:26:04.185 --> 01:26:07.530
waiting that you, you were
born to do something great.

01:26:07.605 --> 01:26:10.950
Make a difference,
do something special.

01:26:12.318 --> 01:26:14.366
Important.

01:26:17.323 --> 01:26:19.542
But Michael.

01:26:21.619 --> 01:26:25.465
It's the most ordinary
thought anybody's ever had.

01:26:29.377 --> 01:26:31.926
I'll see you in court.

01:26:33.881 --> 01:26:36.509
That might be difficult since
your client and partner

01:26:36.592 --> 01:26:39.892
have already
accepted the offer.

01:26:39.970 --> 01:26:41.938
You're right.

01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:48.646
You might've settled with them,
but you haven't settled with me.

01:26:48.729 --> 01:26:52.654
I'm gonna travel the country
making every hospital worker

01:26:52.733 --> 01:26:55.907
who's ever been infected by
a needle stick my client.

01:26:55.986 --> 01:26:58.614
Every mother
that's lost a child,

01:26:58.697 --> 01:27:00.995
every child that's
lost a parent.

01:27:01.075 --> 01:27:03.328
I'm gonna put them
on the stand,

01:27:03.411 --> 01:27:06.005
and I'm gonna tell them that
your client has a needle

01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.503
the could've prevented
it from ever happening,

01:27:08.582 --> 01:27:12.803
but he keeps it locked up 'cause
it costs too much to make.

01:27:15.714 --> 01:27:17.637
Trust me.

01:27:17.716 --> 01:27:20.890
You're about to see just
how ordinary I can be.

01:28:30.247 --> 01:28:31.419
Good morning.

01:28:31.499 --> 01:28:33.752
Good morning to you.

01:28:35.169 --> 01:28:36.466
What is this?

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:38.889
That is a bonus

01:28:38.964 --> 01:28:41.888
for all the hard
work you've been doing.

01:28:41.967 --> 01:28:43.594
Are you serious?

01:28:43.677 --> 01:28:45.270
I am.

01:28:45.346 --> 01:28:46.598
Thank you.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.523
You're welcome.

01:28:48.599 --> 01:28:52.979
Um, listen, there's
along rambling message

01:28:53.062 --> 01:28:54.689
on the machine from Mike.

01:28:54.772 --> 01:28:56.240
Figures.

01:28:58.734 --> 01:29:00.611
There he is now.

01:29:00.694 --> 01:29:03.243
You're up early.

01:29:05.074 --> 01:29:07.168
Yes?

01:29:20.714 --> 01:29:22.307
You're his partner?

01:29:22.383 --> 01:29:24.056
Yeah.

01:29:41.944 --> 01:29:45.118
Died in his sleep.

01:29:45.197 --> 01:29:48.326
So, here's your partner,
Michael Weiss.

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.713
He die...

01:29:56.792 --> 01:29:59.090
He die alone?

01:29:59.169 --> 01:30:02.298
The detectives will be able to
answer some of those questions.

01:30:02.381 --> 01:30:04.429
They'll wanna talk to you also.

01:31:06.779 --> 01:31:11.250
Have you seen
these needles before?

01:31:12.743 --> 01:31:15.371
That's, uh, it's
a safety needle.

01:31:15.454 --> 01:31:17.377
They were used.

01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:22.132
That'll explain why
there're so many of them.

01:32:30.404 --> 01:32:32.281
Are you okay, Mr. Dancort?

01:32:32.364 --> 01:32:35.493
Can we offer you something to drink?
Some tea perhaps?

01:32:35.576 --> 01:32:37.829
No, that's all right.

01:32:41.832 --> 01:32:43.800
Mr. Danzinger.

01:32:43.876 --> 01:32:46.470
Sorry to hear about Mr. Weiss.

01:32:46.545 --> 01:32:49.515
We offer our most
sincere condolences.

01:32:51.633 --> 01:32:54.887
So, since we're all here
we should probably...

01:33:08.609 --> 01:33:11.328
Hello, Nat.
It's been a long time.

01:33:20.120 --> 01:33:21.622
You and me?

01:33:23.207 --> 01:33:25.380
We're going
to court on this one.

01:33:36.386 --> 01:33:38.184
Looking forward to it.
