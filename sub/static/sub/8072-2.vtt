Hey

01:01.729 --> 01:03.331
Coffeemaker's broke again.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.232
So are we.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.799
So fix it.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.934
[laughing]

01:07.034 --> 01:07.835
Sorry, honey.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.903
I've done everything I can.

01:10.003 --> 01:11.139
We'll have to let go.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.873
I'm pulling the plug.

01:12.973 --> 01:14.242

01:14.342 --> 01:15.976
Dan, you know if I don't
get coffee in the morning

01:16.076 --> 01:17.678
I can get cranky.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.480
Here.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.583
Just a pinch between
your cheek and gum.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.918
Where's that instant
crap I save for company?

01:29.157 --> 01:32.293
My god, it's decaf, who
let that into the house?

01:32.393 --> 01:34.027
We've got to get a
new coffee maker.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.129
Oh, honey, nah.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.430
We're trying to cut back.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.199
Oh, did you cancel the cable?

01:38.299 --> 01:39.099
Well--

01:39.200 --> 01:42.102
(IMITATING RICKY

01:42.203 --> 01:43.937
No, I didn't cancel it.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.806
But it's not like I paid
the bill or nothing.

01:45.906 --> 01:46.707
Hello!

01:46.807 --> 01:48.376
Hello!

01:48.476 --> 01:49.543
God.

01:49.643 --> 01:50.744
You're way too happy.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.146
Go out and come back in.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.080
Be nice, Roseanne.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.048
I brought you breakfast.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.551
Oh, coffee cake.

01:57.651 --> 01:58.886
Ironic, isn't it?

02:00.788 --> 02:06.093
Listen Ros, I'm really
sorry to hear about Becky.

02:06.194 --> 02:07.428
Did that come out right?

02:10.898 --> 02:13.000
I never know what to
say in these situations.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.536
I mean, I just feel
so uncomfortable.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.705
It's just like torture.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.072
Gee, Nance, that's rough.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.541
Let us know if there's
anything we can do.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.413
So Nancy and I are going
to go down to the mall

02:25.513 --> 02:28.249
and find me a dress for
the singles dance tonight.

02:28.349 --> 02:33.421
You want to come along and
undermine my self-confidence?

02:33.521 --> 02:35.456
Well, how sweet
of you to ask me.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.857
And I'd love to go.
But no.

02:36.957 --> 02:40.027
I can't, because Becky and Mark
are going to come over today.

02:40.127 --> 02:40.994
Oh, wow.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.196
How'd you pull that off?

02:42.296 --> 02:44.398
Well, we worked out a truce.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.467
Well, that's great, right?

02:46.567 --> 02:47.801
That's really great.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.770
I got some repair
work out in the garage.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.339
What kind of repair work?

02:51.439 --> 02:52.540
A couple bikes.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.408
Well, you have to do it
now, when Becky and Mark

02:54.508 --> 02:55.343
are going to come over?

02:55.443 --> 02:56.810
I don't fix
them, we don't eat.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.280
Well, you are going to come in
and say hi when they come home,

02:59.380 --> 03:00.348
aren't you?

03:00.448 --> 03:01.249
Dan!

03:04.051 --> 03:04.852
Whoa.

03:04.952 --> 03:05.853
Yeah, I know.

03:05.953 --> 03:07.288
Is he at least talking
to you about it?

03:07.388 --> 03:08.222
No.

03:08.322 --> 03:10.291
He doesn't want to
talk to anybody.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.125
He just wants to fix things.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.962
That is so destructive.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.367
Yeah and you know it's just
the calm before the storm,

03:19.467 --> 03:22.736
because when he sees Becky
he's going to go ballistic.

03:22.836 --> 03:27.207
I mean, things are going to
get really ugly around here.

03:27.308 --> 03:31.579
It will be kind of nice to
have everything back to normal.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.828
Fine.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.298
Except thanks to you, now
I'm related to my girlfriend.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.302
So where's mom?

03:54.402 --> 03:56.870
She's in the kitchen
with the knives.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.108
Want me to go
in there with you?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.610
With the knives.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.980
Listen, why don't you
go on to your parents.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.750
By the time you get back,
everything will be fine, OK?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.018
All right.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.152
I'll see you later.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.053
Bye.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.831
If you lie very
still she may just

04:23.931 --> 04:25.032
sniff you and leave you alone.

Mom?

04:48.389 --> 04:49.823
Hey.

04:49.923 --> 04:50.724
Hey.

04:58.699 --> 05:05.539
Um, I'm married.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.707
Me too.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.676
Isn't it fun?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.644
[laughing]

05:14.214 --> 05:18.318
So how are things around here?

05:18.419 --> 05:19.219
How do you think?

05:22.289 --> 05:23.223
He needed a job.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.124
He had to go.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.058
What was I supposed to do?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.561
How about let him go?

05:27.661 --> 05:28.929
Do you think he'd
drop everything

05:29.029 --> 05:29.963
to follow you someplace?

05:30.063 --> 05:30.864
Yes.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.166
I do.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.235
You know it was Mark's
idea to get married.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.937
Well, call me old
fashioned, but what's

05:37.037 --> 05:37.938
wrong with living in sin?

05:42.275 --> 05:43.243
We made the right decision.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.750
I mean, I--I love him, Mother.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.851
Are you sure
that he loves you?

05:55.423 --> 05:56.223
I'm sure.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.128
[groaning]

06:02.195 --> 06:03.130
Come on, Mom.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.465
He didn't have to
ask me to marry him.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.800
I mean, it sure wasn't
for my inheritance.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.102
That's a good one.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.740
All right.

06:12.840 --> 06:16.477
Well, maybe there's
a very small chance

06:16.577 --> 06:19.079
that this isn't the
very worst mistake

06:19.179 --> 06:20.881
you're ever going to make
for the rest of your life.

06:23.116 --> 06:25.419
Thanks, Mom.

06:25.519 --> 06:29.356
So what was your wedding like?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.759
Well, we went to this
justice of the peace,

06:31.859 --> 06:33.861
and he did it in
his living room.

06:33.961 --> 06:37.164
And his wife threw rice at us.

06:37.264 --> 06:39.867
So are those, like,
your wedding jeans,

06:39.967 --> 06:43.671
because you might want to
save those so you can pass

06:43.771 --> 06:44.772
them on to your own daughter.

06:47.775 --> 06:49.877
Oh, we just wanted
to get married.

06:49.977 --> 06:51.545
It didn't matter.

06:51.645 --> 06:54.948
It did to me.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.316
You know, I didn't want much.

06:56.416 --> 07:00.788
I just wanted, like, a cake,
and some flowers, and a band.

07:00.888 --> 07:04.057
And I wanted to be there.

07:04.157 --> 07:05.993
Oh, I'm sorry, Mom.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.971
All right.

07:18.071 --> 07:19.640
Well, I'm almost numb.

07:19.740 --> 07:22.009
So where is Mark?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.977
Well, he had to go
to his parents' house.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.379
They're giving us some
furniture and stuff.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.616
Oh.

07:28.716 --> 07:31.084
Well we're going to
give you something too.

07:31.184 --> 07:33.020
You're kidding, what?

07:33.120 --> 07:35.188
A-- a-- a coffee maker.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.090
[laughing]

07:39.560 --> 07:40.861
[sighing]

07:40.961 --> 07:43.430
May have to rebuild
the whole rear section.

07:43.531 --> 07:45.465
Hope the brakes aren't gone too.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.867

07:50.137 --> 07:52.906

Hi, DJ!

08:05.352 --> 08:07.120
Did you bring me anything?

08:07.220 --> 08:08.656
No, DJ.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.190
I've been a little busy.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.992
OK.

Congratulations.
- Thanks.

08:19.733 --> 08:20.868
Becky.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.703
So how's it going?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.772
- Pretty good.
- Yeah?

08:24.872 --> 08:26.306
(STRAINED) Becky.

08:26.406 --> 08:27.207
Yeah?

08:27.307 --> 08:28.475
You're hurting me.

08:34.481 --> 08:36.950
So, Dad,

08:37.985 --> 08:38.986
I just figured we should talk.

08:46.159 --> 08:50.598
I just want to say that I
didn't mean to hurt you.

08:53.366 --> 08:54.768
It's just that you
never would have

08:54.868 --> 08:56.236
let me do it any other way.

09:02.676 --> 09:04.311
Mark and I really
love each other.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.448
I mean, you know what
a great guy he is.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.618
You were always the one
who stuck up for him.

09:10.718 --> 09:11.518
Mm-hmm.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.724
Dad, I know what
you're thinking,

09:16.824 --> 09:19.192
but I'm not screwing up my life.

09:19.292 --> 09:20.828
I mean, Mark's got a great job.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.229
I'm going to finish
school while he works.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.665
And hey, I can go to community
college in Minneapolis

09:24.765 --> 09:26.533
just the same as I can here.

09:26.634 --> 09:28.335
Right.

09:28.435 --> 09:30.370
Mom is OK with this.

09:30.470 --> 09:31.271
Why can't you be?

09:36.209 --> 09:38.311
Come on, things were
so tough around here.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.780
I was just another
mouth to feed.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.782
I thought I was, like, doing
you a favor by leaving.

09:47.387 --> 09:49.222
Don't do any favors, Becky.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.258
Ask the chicken.

10:28.361 --> 10:29.262
Yikes.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.430
What do you think?

10:30.530 --> 10:32.099
It's for the singles
dance tonight.

10:32.199 --> 10:36.536
So I'm-- I look too
desperate, don't I?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.205
No.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.807
You look just desperate enough.

10:39.907 --> 10:40.708
Oh.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.143
Well, thanks a lot, Roseanne.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.978
Oh, with all I've
been going through

10:45.078 --> 10:48.448
I just have the
strength to lie to you.

10:48.548 --> 10:50.684
I'm sure you'll meet some
really nice guy at the dance.

10:50.784 --> 10:51.584
There.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.585
I got a second wind.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.725
Hey, look who's here.

10:57.825 --> 11:00.994
Mom, Darlene won't
let me put the beds

11:01.094 --> 11:03.764
next to each other so mark and
I can sleep together tonight.

11:03.864 --> 11:09.269
Just so I know, who am
I supposed to be mad at?

11:09.369 --> 11:11.772
I am not moving
to DJ's room so she

11:11.872 --> 11:16.176
and my dork-in-law can conceive
some demon spawn in my bed.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.111
[laughing]

11:21.081 --> 11:24.117
I'm going to go sit
on my bed until morning.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.820
Mark is my husband, mother.

11:26.920 --> 11:28.055
We're not going to
stay in this house

11:28.155 --> 11:29.189
if we can't sleep together.

11:31.591 --> 11:32.893
Fine.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.494
Beat the hell out of
this chicken, please.

11:38.565 --> 11:42.402
(QUIETLY) Becky.
(WHISPERED) Becky!

11:42.502 --> 11:45.605
I was hoping that we'd get
a moment alone together.

11:45.705 --> 11:48.208
Before your mother gets back,
I know it has been tough.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.509
But I just want to
tell you I think

11:49.609 --> 11:50.778
it's wonderful that
you're starting

11:50.878 --> 11:52.412
your life out with somebody.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.048
And I wish you guys all
the luck in the world.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.785
And whatever happens
between you and the family,

11:57.885 --> 12:01.688
or between you and Mark, I
will always be there for you.

12:01.789 --> 12:05.392
This is my great grandma
Harris's wedding ring.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.426
Oh, Jackie.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.895
She gave this to
me before she died.

12:07.995 --> 12:10.697
She made me promise never to
tell Roseanne that I had it.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.532
So I want you to put
that away somewhere

12:12.632 --> 12:14.301
and don't ever let
your mother see that.

12:15.903 --> 12:18.038
Oh, Jackie, this
means so much to me.

12:18.138 --> 12:19.439
I'm really going to miss you.
- I know.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.607
It's OK.

12:20.707 --> 12:21.741
Oh.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.143
But don't you want to
save something like this

12:23.243 --> 12:24.077
for when you get married?

12:24.177 --> 12:25.512
[laughing]

12:25.612 --> 12:27.414
[crying]

12:27.514 --> 12:29.349
[music playing]

12:32.820 --> 12:35.789
OK, well it's Becky's
last night home.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.992
So we're going to have a
happy family time together.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.027
[grumbling]

12:40.127 --> 12:41.228
Oh, come on.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.863
We're going to sit here
and we're going to visit.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.832
Could we visit someone else?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.135
Oh, I'll get it.

12:48.235 --> 12:49.036
It's Mark.

12:51.071 --> 12:51.872
Hey.

12:51.972 --> 12:52.806
I missed you.

12:52.906 --> 12:54.107
Hmm, we all did.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.678
Come on in, honey,
everything's OK.

12:58.778 --> 12:59.579
Yeah.

12:59.679 --> 13:01.248
We're just sitting and visiting.

13:03.917 --> 13:04.818
Are you hungry, honey?

13:04.918 --> 13:06.253
Yeah, I could
fix you something.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.154
No.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.255
I ate at my folks.

13:08.355 --> 13:09.990
Thanks anyway, Mrs. Conner.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.491
Oh no.

13:11.591 --> 13:13.126
Don't call her Mrs. Conner.

13:16.563 --> 13:17.697
Call her Mom.

13:17.797 --> 13:18.598
[laughing]

13:18.698 --> 13:19.967
She likes it.

13:20.067 --> 13:21.201
Don't you, Mom?

13:21.301 --> 13:24.537
Well, I guess if I let
you call me Mom, why not?

13:27.074 --> 13:29.642
Hey, Rose--

13:32.045 --> 13:33.346
Um, I'm finished out there.

13:33.446 --> 13:35.015
I'm going to wash
up and go to bed.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.416
Did you get anything to eat?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.418
- I'm all right.
- Goodnight, Dad.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.425
Uh, I wouldn't, Mark.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.326
It's cool.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.227
Mom.

13:52.900 --> 13:57.837
Dad, I think, uh, me and
you should talk about this.

14:00.840 --> 14:01.641
You're in my way.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.647
Are you going to move, or
you want me to move you?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.451
Come on, Mark.
It's late.

14:11.551 --> 14:12.886
Let's just go to bed, OK?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.128
Dan.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.330
Happy family time is over.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.298
[laughing]

14:28.835 --> 14:30.570
Well, that was really pretty.

14:30.670 --> 14:31.638
I don't want to talk about it.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.208
Where are they sleeping?

14:35.308 --> 14:37.010
I thought you said you
didn't want to talk about it.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.211
Where are they
sleeping, Roseanne?

14:38.311 --> 14:39.479
They're sleeping
in the girl's room,

14:39.579 --> 14:41.214
and Darlene's
going in DJ's room.

14:41.314 --> 14:42.582
Perfect.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.285
Well, it was either that or
let them go to some cheap motel

14:45.385 --> 14:48.288
where they'd actually enjoy it.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.958
I can't believe
you allowed this.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.626
Well, you give me a
little bit of time Dan,

14:53.726 --> 14:58.198
and no other choice, and I can
just be a remarkable woman.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.133
I get a choice.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.969
I go upstairs and put
his head through a wall.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.070
- Dan
- OK.

15:03.170 --> 15:05.105
I got another choice.
She's 17 years old.

15:05.205 --> 15:07.674
I throw that punk out and
we get this thing annulled.

15:07.774 --> 15:10.310
Yeah and then in two
months, on her 18th birthday,

15:10.410 --> 15:12.245
she goes and does the
exact same thing again,

15:12.345 --> 15:15.482
only this time she hates us and
then we don't see her no more.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.816
So that's your brilliant plan?

15:16.916 --> 15:17.717
We do nothing.

15:17.817 --> 15:19.119
Yeah.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.588
That is my plan, because this
way at least we get birthdays,

15:21.688 --> 15:22.855
we get holidays.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.424
Maybe we get a phone
call once in a while.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.859
But you go up there and
you do something stupid Dan

15:26.960 --> 15:28.261
and we will lose her.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.430
No, I wouldn't want to go up
there and do something stupid,

15:30.530 --> 15:33.600
cause god knows she sure didn't!

15:33.700 --> 15:34.701
You know what's going to happen?

15:34.801 --> 15:35.835
She's going to get pregnant!

15:35.935 --> 15:37.804
She's going to forget
all about school!

15:37.904 --> 15:39.039
This is it!

15:39.139 --> 15:39.939
This is her life!

15:42.909 --> 15:45.312
What do you want
to happen, Dan?

15:45.412 --> 15:47.880
You're screaming at me, OK?

15:47.981 --> 15:50.083
You're walking around
here like some psycho.

15:50.183 --> 15:52.852
What exactly is it that
you want to happen?!

15:52.952 --> 15:54.621
I want my bike shop back.

15:54.721 --> 15:55.722
I want my daughter back.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.727
I went things back
the way they were

16:00.827 --> 16:02.129
before I screwed everything up.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.767
So is that what you
do out there all day

16:07.867 --> 16:10.070
long in that garage, just
sit there and blame yourself?

16:10.170 --> 16:11.571
Well, maybe I do.
But you know what?

16:11.671 --> 16:12.472
I'm allowed.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.940
She's not.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.876
She's not blaming you Dan.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.180
She's really happy right now!

16:20.280 --> 16:22.082
She's going to wait
until this whole marriage

16:22.182 --> 16:24.217
thing goes to hell and
then she'll blame you.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.121
You've been a great father, Dan.

16:30.523 --> 16:32.159
She's healthy.
She's happy.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.527
She can handle herself.

16:34.627 --> 16:35.562
What more can we expect?

16:37.564 --> 16:38.365
Not this.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.603
I can't go along
with this, honey.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.039
Well, Dan, you have to.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.207
We don't have any other choice.

16:51.978 --> 16:53.846
[springs creaking]

16:54.947 --> 16:56.783
[laughing]

17:02.289 --> 17:03.556
I'm going to be
out in the garage.

17:07.094 --> 17:08.461
BECKY: Very funny, Darlene!

17:08.561 --> 17:12.899
Stop jumping on DJ's bed!

17:12.999 --> 17:14.834
[music playing]

17:17.404 --> 17:19.306
Mark, take it easy.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.574
Uh, you got safety flares?

17:21.674 --> 17:22.609
Yep.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.244
You've got yourself
a good man, Becky.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.548
All right, I knew
this was coming.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.683
So, uh, we're too young.

17:30.783 --> 17:32.785
I'm not good enough for her.

17:32.885 --> 17:33.686
And I've got no future.

17:33.786 --> 17:35.188
Eyes on your own paper.

17:37.023 --> 17:38.625
Look, you're just ticked
off with me, because you

17:38.725 --> 17:40.093
think I made Becky marry me.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.661
Well, let me tell you something.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.731
Becky doesn't do a damn
thing she doesn't want to.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.299
OK.

17:46.399 --> 17:48.501
That's fair enough.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.037
She got married
because she wanted to.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.206
Well, she also wants
to finish high school.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.408
And if she doesn't
then I'm going to know

17:55.508 --> 17:57.977
that that's because of you.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.679
And she also wants
to go to college.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.648
And if she doesn't do that
then I'm going to know

18:01.748 --> 18:04.317
that that's because of you.

18:04.417 --> 18:08.188
Hey, I'm going to
take care of her, OK?

18:08.288 --> 18:09.856
Just back off.

18:09.956 --> 18:11.158
[chuckling]

18:11.258 --> 18:12.659
Foolish boy.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.931
Oh, you know nothing
of my powers, do you?

18:21.234 --> 18:24.437
See, I'm not just some royal
pain in your butt anymore.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.739
I'm your mother-in-law.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.975
[laughing]

18:29.075 --> 18:32.579
You think I've made your
life difficult so far?

18:32.679 --> 18:33.980
Well, now I'm family.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.449
And you've seen the
way I treat my family.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.221
All packed.

18:41.321 --> 18:42.589
Are we ready?
- Yeah.

18:42.689 --> 18:43.490
We are now.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.996
DJ, Darlene, get down here.

18:50.096 --> 18:51.564
I'll get in the car.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.200
(WHISPERED) OK.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.735
- Does Dad know we're leaving?
- Yeah.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.636
He knows.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.544
Your sister's leaving.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.445
See ya.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.682
I hope you know how
hard that was for him.

19:13.653 --> 19:16.088
Take it easy.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.890
You too.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.059
I'll miss you.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.229
Will you call?

19:22.329 --> 19:23.129
Promise.

19:25.064 --> 19:25.865
I love you, Becky.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.369
I love you, Darlene.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.773
Did you ever know
that you're my hero?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.475
[laughing]

19:35.575 --> 19:37.377
You are the wind
beneath my wings--

19:37.477 --> 19:38.278
All right.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.746
Knock it off.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.714
[laughing]

19:42.815 --> 19:45.218
See you, bubble butt.

19:45.318 --> 19:46.586
Later, Morticia.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.397
OK, well, call me as
soon as you get there.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.699
And then every hour after that.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.139
Wait a minute.

20:07.240 --> 20:11.644
Um, do you remember my
great grandmother Harris?

20:15.282 --> 20:17.684
Well, um, she gave
me her wedding ring.

20:17.784 --> 20:21.954
And I would like
for you to have it.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.924
But you can never ever
let Aunt Jackie see it.

20:28.928 --> 20:29.729
Thanks, Mom.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.037
Say goodbye to dad for me, OK?

20:50.149 --> 20:51.050
Buh-bye, Mom.

20:58.190 --> 20:58.991
Bye, Becky.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.677
They're going to call
as soon as they get in.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.779
She's going to take a high
school equivalency test,

21:19.879 --> 21:20.913
you know?

21:21.013 --> 21:25.017
And then she can start
junior college mid-year.

21:27.987 --> 21:29.922
She says they got a
very nice apartment.

21:33.192 --> 21:34.961
I think he'll take
good care of her.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.897
He's making really good money.

21:37.997 --> 21:41.100
And he's really afraid of me.

21:41.200 --> 21:43.069
Good.
