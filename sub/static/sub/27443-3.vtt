Previously on Music City

00:02.359 --> 00:04.945
While Rachyl and I were
preparing for my big day...

00:05.031 --> 00:06.732
I don't think you understand what

00:06.766 --> 00:09.136
six years of feeling lonely is.

00:09.168 --> 00:12.004
...our friendship hit a major roadblock.

00:12.037 --> 00:15.675
And Jeremiah was determined to
pull Rachyl away from Kerry.

00:15.708 --> 00:18.678
Regardless of how Kerry feels,
just seek your own happiness.

00:18.711 --> 00:20.012
Are you  .....  kidding?

00:20.045 --> 00:22.982
A photo of Bryant and
Sammy had Alisa seeing red.

00:23.016 --> 00:24.717
Have you ever had feelings for her?

00:24.751 --> 00:25.985
Do you have feelings for her?

00:26.019 --> 00:28.020
And his silence was
all she needed to hear.

00:28.054 --> 00:29.156
See you never.

00:29.188 --> 00:31.023
Jackson chose love over family...

00:31.056 --> 00:32.825
I bet she's pissed that I'm not there.

00:32.858 --> 00:34.026
The last contestant...

00:34.068 --> 00:35.294
...leaving his cousin, Alexandra,

00:35.327 --> 00:37.763
alone on the biggest stage of her life.

00:37.796 --> 00:39.799
... South Dakota!

- Hey.
- Hey.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.563
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:57.634 --> 01:00.587
- How'd you sleep?
- Good.

01:00.619 --> 01:01.455
Good.

01:01.488 --> 01:02.156
Glad you're home.

01:02.212 --> 01:03.467
Glad to be home.

01:03.522 --> 01:06.115
It's nice not to wake
up to a empty house.

01:10.530 --> 01:12.198
I wasn't gone that long.

01:12.231 --> 01:14.067
It's not like I went
to war and came back.

01:19.781 --> 01:21.447
What have you guys been
doing this whole time?

01:21.486 --> 01:24.595
Just like... dance parties every night.

01:24.681 --> 01:26.243
Here or elsewhere?

01:26.322 --> 01:28.922
Mostly here, just me and Wolf.

01:28.946 --> 01:31.582
OK.

01:31.593 --> 01:32.531
I have to go.

01:32.542 --> 01:34.645
Love you.

01:34.980 --> 01:35.981
Love you, too.

01:50.328 --> 01:53.131
Molly, get your little
skinny ass up here.

02:00.908 --> 02:01.709
What?

02:01.775 --> 02:02.743
What is this?

02:02.775 --> 02:03.476
Oh, my god?

02:03.510 --> 02:04.511
Wait?

02:04.543 --> 02:05.978
Did a bird just poop on you?

02:06.011 --> 02:06.879
Oh, shit!

02:06.913 --> 02:08.615
Wait, it totally did.

02:08.646 --> 02:09.650
Is it still there?

02:09.681 --> 02:11.518
Yes, it's on your back, too.

02:11.550 --> 02:13.519
What the hell?

02:13.552 --> 02:14.754
- Get it off!
- It's off.

02:14.788 --> 02:15.722
You're good.

02:15.754 --> 02:16.956
Oh, my god!

02:16.990 --> 02:18.959
Wait, it's good luck
if a bird poops on you.

02:18.991 --> 02:20.693
I've never heard that phrase before.

02:20.727 --> 02:21.628
It's a wives' tale.

02:21.661 --> 02:22.596
You haven't heard that?

02:22.628 --> 02:23.496
No!

02:23.530 --> 02:24.580
It's such good luck!

02:24.591 --> 02:26.599
Maybe we should have had
that happen before USA.

02:26.633 --> 02:29.870
Because that was ridiculous.

02:29.902 --> 02:31.837
Wait, but if we're
actually being serious,

02:31.871 --> 02:33.807
I was mad as hell because
Jackson wasn't there.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.641
The fact that he didn't show up for that

02:35.675 --> 02:37.511
is kind of ridiculous.

02:37.544 --> 02:39.580
I know I told him not to bring Baylee.

02:39.612 --> 02:41.514
But I never thought he wouldn't come.

02:41.548 --> 02:42.783
You've worked so hard for this.

02:42.816 --> 02:44.651
He helped you train for it.

02:44.683 --> 02:48.454
Why would he not show
up at the last minute? You know.

02:48.487 --> 02:49.346
I don't know.

02:49.362 --> 02:50.924
That's just a slap in the face, almost.

02:50.956 --> 02:52.626
It's like, hey, I
helped you get this far,

02:52.658 --> 02:54.460
but I'm not going to
show up for the moment.

02:54.493 --> 02:57.664
Yeah. I think that he has
pretty much revolved his life

02:57.697 --> 02:59.633
around Baylee.

02:59.665 --> 03:02.835
So it seems like when
he gets in a relationship

03:02.868 --> 03:05.838
it's like he falls
hard and he falls fast.

03:05.872 --> 03:06.907
It sucks.

03:06.939 --> 03:08.326
It really hurt my feelings.

03:08.365 --> 03:10.843
I'm at a loss of words
of why he didn't show up.

03:10.877 --> 03:11.778
I don't know.

03:11.811 --> 03:14.581
It's so mean.

03:14.614 --> 03:16.249
I don't know. I'm over it.

03:16.282 --> 03:18.018
I can't even do it anymore.

03:18.050 --> 03:20.519
Ali, I love you so much.

03:20.552 --> 03:22.021
But I'm going to host
a pity party for you.

03:22.055 --> 03:23.090
For what?

03:23.122 --> 03:24.924
For not winning Miss USA!

03:24.957 --> 03:25.825
Oh, fabulous!

03:25.859 --> 03:28.092
- Yay!
- Yay!

03:28.103 --> 03:30.530
I mean, you know, girl, any
excuse to throw a party,

03:30.562 --> 03:31.964
I'm going to throw it.

03:31.997 --> 03:33.834
The pity party!

03:33.866 --> 03:36.269
Pity partay.

03:36.302 --> 03:37.503
We're doing it.

03:37.537 --> 03:38.272
Who else do you want to come?

03:38.305 --> 03:39.573
Rachyl.

03:39.605 --> 03:40.674
I love her.

03:40.706 --> 03:41.707
She's really cute and fun.

03:41.741 --> 03:42.843
Yeah, no, she has to come.

03:42.876 --> 03:44.645
Maybe of few your Tinder dates.

03:44.677 --> 03:46.545
Good Lord, I've never been on Tinder!

03:46.579 --> 03:47.647
Yeah, right!

03:47.681 --> 03:49.850
I meet them out in the wild!

03:49.883 --> 03:52.286
Do you know how we're going
to get back at Jackson for not

03:52.325 --> 03:53.701
coming to Miss USA?

03:53.717 --> 03:57.123
Let's invite Savana, and then
not tell Jackson or Baylee.

03:57.865 --> 03:59.782
Oh, my god! I would die.

03:59.793 --> 04:02.628
Savana and Baylee are going to
be in the same room together!

04:02.662 --> 04:04.865
Jackson will not be
happy his ex is there.

04:04.897 --> 04:06.133
Wait, we have to!

04:06.165 --> 04:09.002
I said it, not you!

04:09.034 --> 04:10.037
Pity party!

04:10.069 --> 04:11.737
Pity party!

04:21.079 --> 04:29.722
♪ I know I will love you forever! ♪

04:29.755 --> 04:38.030
♪ You guys, make some noise. ♪

04:38.063 --> 04:43.035
♪ And everything I see is
everything I want, Miami. ♪

04:43.068 --> 04:47.707
♪ We feeling dreams and
falling hard, Miami. ♪

04:47.741 --> 04:53.046
♪ Going to wave my hand
and push my heart, Miami. ♪

04:53.078 --> 04:55.181
This is the last place I want to be.

04:55.215 --> 04:56.782
I came here on a mission.

04:56.816 --> 04:57.917
You're ready to get closure.

04:57.950 --> 04:59.919
Yeah. Something fishy is going on here.

04:59.953 --> 05:01.688
And I need answers.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.155
Sammy is going to be here.

05:03.188 --> 05:05.025
And I'm going to ask her what
went on with her and Bryant.

05:05.058 --> 05:06.659
- Oh, god.
- Lord, help us all.

05:06.693 --> 05:07.893
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

05:07.926 --> 05:09.091
Here it goes.

05:26.044 --> 05:27.681
Oh, god.

05:27.697 --> 05:29.193
What? What?

05:29.288 --> 05:32.069
_

05:32.184 --> 05:32.952
She is here.

05:32.986 --> 05:34.054
She's here.

05:34.087 --> 05:35.722
Are you going to go talk to her?

05:35.776 --> 05:36.310
Yeah.

05:36.321 --> 05:37.656
Oh, my gosh ***.

05:37.690 --> 05:38.625
I just got really nervous for you.

05:38.657 --> 05:40.693
You don't have to come. Just stay here.

05:40.727 --> 05:41.628
Are you sure?

05:41.660 --> 05:42.773
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

05:42.784 --> 05:44.386
Be nice.

05:47.900 --> 05:48.768
Nice.

05:48.801 --> 05:49.936
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:49.969 --> 05:51.070
Long time no see.

05:51.104 --> 05:51.871
Yeah.

05:51.905 --> 05:52.839
How's it going?

05:52.871 --> 05:54.807
Um, it's pretty good.

05:54.840 --> 05:55.775
Cool.

05:55.808 --> 05:58.111
I figured you'd be here.

05:58.143 --> 05:59.245
So I wanted to...

05:59.279 --> 06:00.981
Typically at all of their shows.

06:01.013 --> 06:01.914
Yeah.

06:01.948 --> 06:02.948
And I wanted to chat.

06:02.981 --> 06:06.052
- Awesome.
- Well, I mean, what do you want to talk about?

06:06.085 --> 06:07.854
I just feel like I need closure.

06:07.887 --> 06:10.791
So let's just get to the bottom.

06:10.823 --> 06:14.126
Did you hook up with Bryant
while he and I were together?

06:14.159 --> 06:16.662
Wow.

06:16.695 --> 06:17.897
Well, do you really want to know?

06:17.931 --> 06:19.231
- Yeah. Talk to me.
- OK, cool.

06:19.265 --> 06:21.801
So you are someone who has
known Bryant for, what,

06:21.835 --> 06:22.870
maybe six months to a year.

06:22.902 --> 06:25.438
- I've known him for four years of my life.
- OK

06:25.472 --> 06:26.873
I've had feelings for him.

06:26.905 --> 06:28.674
He's had feelings for
me we've hooked up.

06:28.707 --> 06:29.943
It's been like that.

06:29.976 --> 06:30.756
Wow.

06:30.819 --> 06:32.812
He's not the person
that I thought he was.

06:32.845 --> 06:34.180
I don't know what you expect I don't

06:34.214 --> 06:36.450
know why you had to get all
dolled up and come here.

06:36.482 --> 06:38.250
Because I was trying to be an
adult, and have a conversation,

06:38.284 --> 06:39.252
and have a conversation...

06:39.267 --> 06:41.046
Alisa, you're making
yourself look pathetic,

06:41.057 --> 06:43.689
showing up at this show
where no one wants you here.

06:43.722 --> 06:45.458
No one cares about you here.

06:45.491 --> 06:46.792
I don't like you.

06:46.825 --> 06:47.916
I don't think you're good for Bryant.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.830
Because I have a little
thing called intuition.

06:49.863 --> 06:52.299
And my intuition told
me that you're a snake.

06:55.801 --> 06:57.938
So good luck.

06:57.970 --> 06:59.305
You and Bryant deserve each other.

06:59.339 --> 07:02.175
You are clearly
threatened if you're here.

07:02.207 --> 07:02.975
Bye, bitch.

07:03.008 --> 07:04.044
 .....  off.

07:04.077 --> 07:05.278
Slut.

07:05.311 --> 07:08.215
I knock them dead, like...

07:35.063 --> 07:37.900
Come on, muscles.

07:38.420 --> 07:39.748
Your farts really did
come out of nowhere.

07:39.759 --> 07:40.723
Out of nowhere!

07:45.268 --> 07:46.424
I hate when my leg hair gets wet.

07:46.435 --> 07:49.471
It looks like a bunch of pubes.

07:49.651 --> 07:51.521
So you didn't go to the Miss USA pageant

07:51.554 --> 07:54.024
with the most beautiful
women in America?

07:54.057 --> 07:57.227
I had the most beautiful
woman in America, dude.

07:57.259 --> 07:59.595
You know how I am when it
comes to that kind of stuff.

07:59.629 --> 08:02.699
- I know.
- It's just like, I see no one else but her.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.502
I mean, it could be the
Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.

08:05.535 --> 08:06.770
And I'd be sitting next to Baylee.

08:06.802 --> 08:08.838
I'd just be looking at
her like, hey, girl.

08:08.870 --> 08:11.240
You know?

08:11.273 --> 08:13.643
I would like you to go
help me pick a ring.

08:13.675 --> 08:14.944
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:14.978 --> 08:16.780
When you know, you know.

08:16.812 --> 08:18.914
And when it comes to Baylee,
dude, there's no question, man.

08:18.947 --> 08:20.783
And I'm ready to take
that step in my life.

08:20.817 --> 08:21.951
And I just feel like it's time.

08:21.985 --> 08:23.328
It's on my heart.

08:23.339 --> 08:26.055
I would love for you to be a
part of that process of finding

08:26.088 --> 08:27.624
a ring for her.

08:27.656 --> 08:28.828
- I'm there.
- All right, cool.

08:28.839 --> 08:30.940
100%.

08:31.127 --> 08:33.662
You watched Ali's Miss USA?

08:33.695 --> 08:34.638
Yeah.

08:34.649 --> 08:35.965
I was so shocked that she lost.

08:35.998 --> 08:38.634
Right when she got put out, I was like,

08:38.668 --> 08:40.636
she's going to be so
mad I didn't make it.

08:40.669 --> 08:41.938
I was like, I'll be the 100%.

08:41.971 --> 08:43.773
I mean, I feel so bad I didn't go.

08:43.804 --> 08:45.675
But she should have never
told me not to bring Baylee.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.677
I mean, It's a stressful
time in Ali's life.

08:47.709 --> 08:48.644
I mean, she's going
through a lot of stuff...

08:48.678 --> 08:49.579
I mean, come on!

08:49.612 --> 08:50.546
...especially going through the pageant.

08:50.579 --> 08:51.747
I mean, she had a lot
of pressure on her.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.482
And you did bail on her to
hang out with your girlfriend.

08:54.183 --> 08:55.952
But that's the last thing
she needs to worry about.

08:55.984 --> 08:57.987
Just go be beautiful. Go be yourself.

08:58.021 --> 08:59.789
It doesn't sound too stressful to me.

08:59.822 --> 09:01.857
Well you know Ali, though.

09:01.891 --> 09:04.593
Yes, I know Ali far too well.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.839
Are you going to Ali's pity party?

09:06.902 --> 09:07.963
- I'm not going to be able to make it.
- You can't go?

09:07.997 --> 09:08.765
Not going to be able to make it.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.644
Dude, come on. I need you there.

09:10.698 --> 09:11.734
I have to face the wrath on my own?

09:11.767 --> 09:14.206
Ali's going to be
pissed at you, regardless.

09:15.637 --> 09:17.107
Great, so excited for that.

I saw it shining up there.

10:53.136 --> 10:55.671
I was trying to show everybody, like,

No, there's nothing inappropriate...

19:41.849 --> 19:43.135
- Yes, there is.
- ...going on

19:43.146 --> 19:44.606
Yes, there is. I'm telling you right

19:44.617 --> 19:46.718
now, your relationship is inappropriate.

19:46.742 --> 19:47.876
You knew it was inappropriate.

19:47.909 --> 19:48.944
That's why you stopped it.

19:48.976 --> 19:50.780
I didn't cheat with Jeremiah.

19:50.812 --> 19:52.514
Cheat... having an emotional
relationship with someone else

19:52.548 --> 19:53.583
is cheating.

19:57.786 --> 19:59.522
You don't believe what
you did was wrong?

20:03.459 --> 20:05.328
I don't think this is
about wrong and right.

20:10.598 --> 20:12.834
Cool, good talk.

20:31.787 --> 20:36.424
You have disrespected
this entire family.

20:36.457 --> 20:39.594
I need you to decide if you're
going to be in this marriage

20:39.627 --> 20:41.629
or not.

20:41.663 --> 20:44.467
♪ And so I went south to define me. ♪

21:05.324 --> 21:07.231
Next time on Music City

21:07.303 --> 21:09.372
I didn't know Savana was
going to be there. Did you?

21:09.383 --> 21:11.251
Because it's kind of  .....  up.

21:11.609 --> 21:12.776
We don't need the shirt.

21:12.810 --> 21:13.702
That's real.

21:13.713 --> 21:15.646
I don't want to stop
hanging out with Jeremiah.

21:15.680 --> 21:18.250
- Oh, God.
- I want to put a ring on your finger

21:18.283 --> 21:20.252
and make you mine for forever.

21:20.285 --> 21:21.952
She needs to really
focus on her marriage.

21:21.986 --> 21:24.389
Because I really don't think
what she's doing is right.

21:24.421 --> 21:26.324
JMack has no right to give advice.

21:26.356 --> 21:27.791
She doesn't know
anything about marriage.

21:27.824 --> 21:29.527
Do you have a minute to talk?

21:29.561 --> 21:30.695
I honestly don't trust you.

21:30.728 --> 21:32.330
I'm sorry if you don't trust me.

21:32.362 --> 21:34.266
How about you  .....  off?

21:34.313 --> 21:35.349
Bye.
