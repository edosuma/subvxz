00:15.224 --> 00:18.476
A third child has been
reported missing today.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.770
9 year old Maisie Snyder.

00:20.771 --> 00:24.315
This comes just two days
after the disappearance of 16

00:24.316 --> 00:26.276
year old Hayden Graham.

00:26.277 --> 00:29.028
Snyder was last seen playing
in the park with her friends.

00:29.029 --> 00:32.115
She is described to be
a little under 4 foot 3

00:32.116 --> 00:33.825
with dark brunette hair.

00:33.826 --> 00:35.618
This being the third
disappearance,

00:35.619 --> 00:38.121
police are advising
parents to take extra

00:38.122 --> 00:39.539
precautions with their children.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.250
If you have any ideas
or clues that would help

00:42.251 --> 00:45.587
police we'd ask you to call
their non-emergency number

00:45.588 --> 00:46.963
that's listed on this screen.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.058
Its open.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.607
Bailey's dead David.

02:35.614 --> 02:36.906
What?

02:36.907 --> 02:37.907
How?

02:37.908 --> 02:38.908
When?

02:38.909 --> 02:39.827
Killed most likely.

02:39.828 --> 02:43.955
His place out in the woods
burned to the ground last night.

02:43.956 --> 02:45.332
He was inside.

02:45.958 --> 02:47.709
Coroners worked on COD right now.

02:47.710 --> 02:48.710
Jesus.

02:48.711 --> 02:51.463
David, we found the kids.

02:52.298 --> 02:59.387
All five dead and buried
in the woods around his house.

02:59.388 --> 03:05.728
Now what?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.903
Jonesy.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.821
No don't.

03:16.822 --> 03:17.864
All those kids, Amelia

03:17.865 --> 03:20.867
All those kids died
and he walked free.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.868
I said don't.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.828
What if it was Kennedy,
or Morgan?

03:23.829 --> 03:26.415
Don't tell me, David, please,

03:26.416 --> 03:29.375
not another word or else.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.753
I - I know.

03:33.923 --> 03:35.089
The case is closed.

03:35.090 --> 03:38.760
We found the kids and at least
the parents

03:38.761 --> 03:39.803
will have some closure.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.681
We all will.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.521
Why did you become an officer?

03:55.694 --> 03:56.694
So I can help people.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.905
So I can stop like

03:58.906 --> 04:01.200
shit like this from happening.

04:02.451 --> 04:05.412
It's hard to help
people while moping around.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.749
Hey, how about you?

04:09.750 --> 04:12.502
To help people and

04:12.503 --> 04:14.755
I've always been a bit
of an adrenaline junkie.

04:15.839 --> 04:18.257
Fair enough.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.954
There's not a day
that I don't think

06:11.955 --> 06:14.791
if I if I could have got
the Polaroids a little

06:14.792 --> 06:17.961
sooner I could've saved them.

06:18.921 --> 06:21.547
A pile of Polaroids
in a bundle of leaves.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.092
Pictures of the young
girls murdered.

06:23.634 --> 06:26.135
Tonight we revisit the Art
Bailey kidnappings

06:26.136 --> 06:27.970
and explore the eerie
circumstances

06:27.971 --> 06:30.306
surrounding the evidence
appearing after Bailey

06:30.307 --> 06:32.392
and his house burned
to the ground.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.727
I heard a crash
and thought a tree had blown

06:34.728 --> 06:35.854
down outside the station.

06:36.772 --> 06:39.232
When I got out there my
partner and I discovered

06:39.233 --> 06:42.443
them sitting neatly
in the middle of a pile

06:42.444 --> 06:43.694
of leaves.

06:43.695 --> 06:45.321
Given the fact
that the Polaroids were found

06:45.322 --> 06:47.365
after Art Bailey's death
could there have

06:47.366 --> 06:48.325
been an accomplice?

06:48.326 --> 06:50.243
No.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.913
Could there be an accomplice?

06:54.623 --> 06:55.623
Yeah.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.625
You can watch
our exclusive report only

06:57.626 --> 07:00.254
here on KZZ 3. Tonight at 7

07:01.630 --> 07:03.340

07:04.842 --> 07:05.384

07:05.384 --> 07:05.884
Oh he's out.

07:10.139 --> 07:11.139
Come here.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.473

07:12.474 --> 07:13.475
Come.

07:14.393 --> 07:15.394
Come.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.020
I'll follow you.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.355
No you have to follow me.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.107
Cause you're so cute.

07:20.107 --> 07:20.566
Come here.

07:20.566 --> 07:20.941
Come on.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.692
Come, come, come.

07:22.693 --> 07:23.277
Go in.

07:23.277 --> 07:23.944
Go ahead bubba.

07:23.945 --> 07:26.405
Go on.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.701
Sucker!

07:34.288 --> 07:37.331
Hey there
fans of the four. What's up?

07:37.332 --> 07:39.001
It's your boy Danny Hawk.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.880
So I'm guessing you can't
sleep right now.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.799
Probably because you're
watching this.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.634
But it's okay.

07:48.552 --> 07:49.636
I'll stay up with you.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.929
Everything's going to be okay.

07:51.930 --> 07:52.931
Haha.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.975
I'm watching a video here.

07:55.976 --> 07:56.935
You know they're probably gonna

07:56.936 --> 07:58.853
perform here eventually.

07:58.854 --> 08:01.899
They always skip
Portland on their tour.

08:02.608 --> 08:03.983
Can't believe
you're going to get Dad

08:03.984 --> 08:05.319
to see a boy band.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.154
Graduating has its perks.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.239
Ugh, god.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.240
Morgan?

08:11.241 --> 08:12.159
Yeah?

08:12.160 --> 08:13.534
Are you screening my calls?

08:13.535 --> 08:14.786
No?

08:15.495 --> 08:17.956
Every time I try to
reach you I get a voicemail.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.584
That's because
my phone is on silent.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.587
Well what's the point
of having a cell phone if you're

08:24.588 --> 08:26.131
just gonna keep it on silent?

08:27.925 --> 08:28.925
Are you ready to go?

08:28.926 --> 08:30.176
Yeah.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.178
Are you?

08:35.765 --> 08:36.765
Almost.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.517
Oh he's probably
just excited to get

08:38.518 --> 08:39.852
out of the office.

08:42.438 --> 08:44.024
Oh no no!

10:07.899 --> 10:08.900
Hey Amelia.

10:20.704 --> 10:22.913
Hey is there anything
I can help you find?

10:22.914 --> 10:24.415
Just shopping around.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.417
Okay.

10:38.055 --> 10:40.181
How much for that?

10:40.182 --> 10:42.934
That's fifty dollars that
comes with the case though.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.852
Does it work?

10:44.853 --> 10:46.313
We don't sell
anything broken here.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.071
How about this one.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.948
Um that one's actually
not supposed to be on the floor.

10:57.949 --> 11:00.076
Uh could you hand that to me.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.078
Let me see that.

11:09.795 --> 11:10.796
Yeah.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.214
That's twenty five dollars.

11:13.215 --> 11:14.966
Fifteen dollars
each for the film.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.970
I will take it and two
packs of photo paper please.

11:20.055 --> 11:21.056
All right.

11:23.767 --> 11:24.934
Thank you.

11:24.935 --> 11:27.603
Um by the way would it be weird
if I said

11:27.604 --> 11:28.605
you looked really good.

11:30.982 --> 11:31.982
Yeah.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.193
Oh and I won't say anything.

11:34.236 --> 11:35.236
Thanks.

11:35.237 --> 11:35.779
Yeah.

11:35.780 --> 11:36.821
Thanks for coming.

11:36.822 --> 11:38.698
Enjoy your hipster crack.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.033
Have fun with um...

11:41.034 --> 11:43.160
Trying not to be creepy.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.413
I will.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.481
Hey Mom,

12:12.482 --> 12:14.150
can I get a ride
over to Kennedys?

12:14.151 --> 12:15.943
Courtney its just a couple

12:15.944 --> 12:17.195
minutes walk from here.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.157
Straight through
where they found Judy.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.245
All right.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.247
Let's go.

12:39.593 --> 12:40.927
Remind me why I'm going to this?

12:41.595 --> 12:42.596
I won't know anyone there.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.807
Because I'm the
greatest wingman ever.

12:48.393 --> 12:49.394
Listen to me.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.104
You'll thank me once to see
her man because Courtney

12:52.105 --> 12:53.105
and she's-uh.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.148
Yeah?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.150
Yeah.

13:00.697 --> 13:01.698
What's that?

13:03.658 --> 13:05.785
That's the Old Bailey
house that burned down.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.453
Killed Mr.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.454
Bailey inside of it.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.081
Damn dude, that's terrible.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.042
I guess.

13:12.043 --> 13:14.627
I mean after it burned down
the police found a whole

13:14.628 --> 13:15.836
bunch of creepy shit inside.

13:15.837 --> 13:17.087
Turns out Mr.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.631
Bailey there's steal little
kids and bury

13:18.632 --> 13:19.591
them in his backyard.

13:19.592 --> 13:20.592
Shit.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.677
They found all these
pictures of these kids

13:23.678 --> 13:27.097
gone missing in the area hidden
right by the foundation.

13:27.098 --> 13:29.017
That's some creepy shit man.

13:29.684 --> 13:30.685
Yeah.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.272
Don't mention it tonight.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.566
Why?

13:37.234 --> 13:39.694
Because Courtney's
sister was one of those kids.

13:43.114 --> 13:44.115
Okay.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.658
Okay.

13:45.659 --> 13:47.034
No no.

13:47.035 --> 13:47.619
Of course.

13:47.620 --> 13:48.620
This is important.

13:50.789 --> 13:51.790
Okay.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.334
I can't right now.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.002
I'm going on vacation.

13:59.923 --> 14:00.924
All right.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.552
I'll be there first thing
on Monday to check it out.

14:05.053 --> 14:06.054
All right.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.602
Don't worry.

14:13.603 --> 14:14.521
I'm going.

14:14.522 --> 14:15.564
You still have your
little party.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.148
What was that about?

14:18.358 --> 14:21.026
Somebody broke
in and stole all the old

14:21.027 --> 14:23.028
evidence from the Bayley case.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.905
That was so long ago.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.282
Yeah I know.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.993
If some people did their
job in the first place.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.119
I wouldn't have to go through
five years of records.

14:30.120 --> 14:30.704
Dad!

14:30.704 --> 14:31.204
What?

14:31.329 --> 14:32.455
You ready to go?

14:32.747 --> 14:33.290
Yes.

14:33.291 --> 14:34.291
Yes.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.377
Be back tomorrow.

14:39.879 --> 14:40.879
All right.

14:40.880 --> 14:41.464
Be safe.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.515
Don't burn down my house.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.977
So that's a no
to indoor fireworks.

14:54.644 --> 14:55.978
Bitch,

14:55.979 --> 14:56.980
I will cut you.

14:59.441 --> 15:00.442
Oh Jesus!

15:00.817 --> 15:03.361
Didn't know cops were so jumpy.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.905
Do I need to call Child
Protective Services?

15:06.114 --> 15:07.906
Nah. He's a loon.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.908
Bye dad!

15:09.576 --> 15:10.577
Bye!

15:12.579 --> 15:15.414
Damnit, I was not ready.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.541
Violet, that is going
to look awful.

15:17.542 --> 15:18.667
Glad it works.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.003
Just picked up in the Pawnshop.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.008
There you go.

15:58.291 --> 16:01.169
Courtney!

16:05.131 --> 16:07.633
Aw did someone need
a ride from mommy?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.385
Hey, you don't judge.

16:09.386 --> 16:10.845
You know I left my
car in California.

16:11.513 --> 16:12.971
I missed you so much.

16:12.972 --> 16:13.972
I missed you.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.516
You really shouldn't
be allowed to go to school

16:15.517 --> 16:16.059
so far away.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.102
Oh yeah, yeah.

16:17.103 --> 16:18.228
I missed you too.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.189
So when are the guys getting here.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.357
Thirsty for Alex's hot friend?

16:23.358 --> 16:24.775
No.

16:24.776 --> 16:26.235
Shut up it's been awhile.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.236
Awhile for a what?

16:27.237 --> 16:28.696
What? You're the worst.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.656
I don't know why I hang
out with you.

16:30.657 --> 16:31.157
Shut up.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.534
You love us.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.498
Oh God damn it.

16:40.417 --> 16:41.417
Hey.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.418
Hey you guys.

16:42.419 --> 16:43.877
Hi!

16:43.878 --> 16:44.879

Hi.

So are you guys ready to party

16:54.931 --> 16:56.140
Yeah.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.142
Let's go.

16:58.601 --> 16:59.601
Oh.

16:59.602 --> 17:00.103
After you.

17:00.103 --> 17:00.603
Sorry.

17:00.604 --> 17:01.604
No it's fine.

17:06.818 --> 17:07.818
All day.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.111
Oh shit!

17:09.112 --> 17:10.112
That's what you get.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.071
Alright.

17:11.071 --> 17:11.489
Alright.

17:11.489 --> 17:11.865
Party foul.

17:11.865 --> 17:12.365
That's what happens right.

17:12.366 --> 17:13.366
Party foul.

17:15.660 --> 17:16.660
God.

17:16.661 --> 17:17.869
You going to start making some?

17:17.871 --> 17:18.747
To make this interesting.

17:18.747 --> 17:19.372
Oh.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.998
Oh right sorry.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.958
Hey you gotta get out
of my house Kennedy.

17:22.959 --> 17:23.960
It's my fucking house.

17:25.211 --> 17:26.211
Oh.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.296
Bring it bro!

17:27.297 --> 17:28.881
I fucking fought a shark!

17:28.882 --> 17:31.759
You fought a shark?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.677
I didn't actually fight
it I accidentally

17:33.678 --> 17:36.013
kicked it while swimming
but still pretty badass,

17:36.014 --> 17:37.389
right?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.099
Oh.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.559
Oh okay all right.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.020
One cup and a foul.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.107
You want to just fling
it out there like.

17:48.610 --> 17:49.819
But you want to make
it so you know.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.197
Hey guys I fought a shark,

17:52.322 --> 17:52.781
So close!

17:52.782 --> 17:54.448
Was was a the.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.910
Hey what have you done, alright?

17:57.869 --> 17:58.828
Okay spider on this.

17:58.829 --> 18:01.413
Oh is that like
put you on your game?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.290
Spiders?

18:02.291 --> 18:04.374
You like the new Spider-man?

18:04.375 --> 18:05.710
Yeah pretty good man.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.100
You know that we're
going to go see them live right?

18:23.520 --> 18:26.772
So do we have to listen
to all the way down.

18:26.773 --> 18:27.607
I know!

18:27.607 --> 18:27.899
I know!

18:27.899 --> 18:28.233
I want!

18:28.233 --> 18:28.733
I want you.

18:42.747 --> 18:44.289
Do you not know the
meaning of the word vacation?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.666
I thought you'd want

18:45.667 --> 18:48.001
to know we have 15 minutes
of footage missing

18:48.002 --> 18:50.338
from the security camera
at the evidence locker.

18:51.548 --> 18:52.549
What do you mean missing?

18:54.217 --> 18:57.095
It's just gone, sir.

18:58.012 --> 18:59.680
Should I come in?

18:59.681 --> 19:01.140
I wouldn't.

19:03.768 --> 19:04.769
Are you sure?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.062
Honestly though,

19:07.063 --> 19:08.064
you probably should.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.441
Officer Jones wants to speak
to you.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.537
So after the party,

19:22.912 --> 19:23.912
it was like a pre-pary.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.622
So I went to class
for the first time

19:25.623 --> 19:26.958
and then found out
he was my teacher.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.835
No seriously, he was my teacher.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.087
It was somebody.

19:33.548 --> 19:36.133
Hey, Kai is a douchebag.

19:36.134 --> 19:37.302
He's horrible.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.052
Such a douchebag.

19:39.053 --> 19:40.345
He is.

19:40.346 --> 19:41.180
He is.

19:41.180 --> 19:41.931
He's cute though.

19:41.932 --> 19:44.976
No, no he's horrible.

19:45.560 --> 19:49.397
No don't do anything with him.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.065
Aw, Violet.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.150
He's got a cute butt
though so that's worth it.

19:53.151 --> 19:54.152
No.

19:55.028 --> 19:56.988
Oh yeah.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.450
How many have you had?

20:02.869 --> 20:03.995
Were you sneaking shots.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.332
What are you doing?

20:09.208 --> 20:11.169
Want to see a trick, watch this.

20:11.170 --> 20:15.464
No!

20:15.465 --> 20:16.924
Voilet!

20:16.925 --> 20:17.717
No!

20:21.512 --> 20:22.180
I'm out.

20:22.180 --> 20:22.597
I'm out.

20:22.597 --> 20:23.514
I'm out.

20:32.023 --> 20:33.398
Are you gonna
be able to do this?

20:33.399 --> 20:35.609
Oh yeah, yeah.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.569
I'm fine.

20:37.111 --> 20:38.111
You know,

20:38.112 --> 20:39.905
we have time before the concert,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.490
if you need to swing
by the office.

20:41.491 --> 20:42.241
Thank god,

20:42.242 --> 20:43.326
this is going to drive me crazy.

20:44.702 --> 20:45.702
Well we're still going.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.622
Oh yeah, we're going.

20:49.499 --> 20:50.499
Tonight.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.042
You bet.

20:51.042 --> 20:51.250
We're...

20:51.251 --> 20:53.752
We're going to be there watching
front row.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.587
Watching the

20:54.588 --> 20:57.339
the four boys to guys. For sure.

20:57.340 --> 20:58.549
Okay.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.425
It'll be real quick.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.761
All right.

21:03.221 --> 21:04.222
Take no time at all.

21:08.309 --> 21:09.977
I'm just so done
with guys because they're

21:09.978 --> 21:11.353
the fucking worst.

21:11.354 --> 21:15.565
So girls, that's hot.

21:15.566 --> 21:17.402
I deserved that.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.361
But you know what I hate?

21:19.362 --> 21:20.988
How guys can't even make
jokes about shit

21:20.989 --> 21:22.239
like that because there's
so much

21:22.240 --> 21:23.408
objectification of women.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.618
So your brought us a douche bag.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.371
Sorry about that, guys.

21:28.372 --> 21:29.955
I mean least Courtney's having
a good time,

21:29.956 --> 21:30.289
you know?

21:30.290 --> 21:32.040
It's not like all
lesbians are hot.

21:32.041 --> 21:33.543
Trust me most aren't.

21:34.085 --> 21:35.627
He's going to say
whatever he wants to get

21:35.628 --> 21:36.462
into her pants and...

21:36.463 --> 21:37.671
Courtney's no dummy.

21:37.672 --> 21:39.172
That's a fake smile.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.050
She's only in it for a short
game.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.720
Thank god for that,

21:44.721 --> 21:47.098
I'd die if she dated
that douche-canoe.

21:48.266 --> 21:49.683
What's that?

21:49.684 --> 21:50.684
Nothing bro.

21:50.685 --> 21:51.977
Shots?

21:51.978 --> 21:53.020
We're gonna be there.

21:53.021 --> 21:54.312
Yes.

21:54.313 --> 21:54.647
4boyz.

21:54.647 --> 21:55.565
Yes.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.524
Going to concert.

21:56.525 --> 21:57.733
I thought that there
were three boys.

21:57.734 --> 21:59.027
Four boys.

22:01.070 --> 22:02.070
Sounds like girls.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.238
They're boys.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.283
They're kinda high pitched.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.785
Oh I'm sorry
but you know we can't

22:08.786 --> 22:13.623
all listen to like Def
Leppard or Metallica or.

22:13.624 --> 22:16.627
You do not speak of Def
Leppard badly in this house.

22:21.299 --> 22:22.382
Are we going to count it?

22:23.718 --> 22:24.594
Okay.

22:30.433 --> 22:32.560
How do you know these people?

22:33.436 --> 22:34.519
We went to high school

22:34.520 --> 22:35.937
elementary school.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.105
It's been a long long time.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.191
College was the first
time away from.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.526
You would vouch for them?

22:40.818 --> 22:41.818
Vouch for them?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.278
Vouch for them.

22:43.279 --> 22:43.780
Like?

22:43.781 --> 22:45.531
Vouching like a voucher?

22:46.032 --> 22:48.326
A Voucher?

22:49.202 --> 22:51.495
You know what I mean.
Would you defend them?

22:51.496 --> 22:52.455
Yeah.

22:52.455 --> 22:52.997
Yeah?

22:52.998 --> 22:53.998
Go!

22:57.835 --> 22:58.835
You're very calculating.

22:58.836 --> 22:59.920
Yeah.

22:59.921 --> 23:01.422
Some people would call
me a hunter.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.132
I just say that I'm more of a
renaissance man,

23:04.133 --> 23:04.634
you know?

23:04.635 --> 23:05.635
Good at everything?

23:07.095 --> 23:09.097
A little bit, yeah.

23:17.563 --> 23:19.397
You know in an alternate
timeline,

23:19.398 --> 23:21.359
it would be you and I having
sex tonight.

23:21.943 --> 23:22.944
With each other?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.363
You don't feel the tension?

23:26.072 --> 23:27.073
No.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.080
You know those
times when a friend

23:35.081 --> 23:37.332
embarrasses you so much
you just want to disown him.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.960
He's still your friend?

23:42.630 --> 23:44.257
Sorry.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.973
Hey Kai!

23:56.060 --> 23:58.770
Yeah, man, ugh.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.147
The picture threw me off.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.940
The flash.

24:01.941 --> 24:02.942
Sure.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.363
All right,

24:10.533 --> 24:12.367
do not let the battery die down.

24:12.368 --> 24:13.327
I'll be right back.

24:13.328 --> 24:15.537
You have 15 minutes
and then we have to go.

24:15.538 --> 24:16.122
15.

24:16.122 --> 24:16.539
I promise.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.461
Let's do it.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.912
I told you to go
enjoy your vacation.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.414
I know.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.333
Don't worry.

25:00.334 --> 25:01.583
This case hasn't been reopened.

25:01.584 --> 25:04.378
We're just trying to find
out how someone got in here.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.007
What'd they take?

25:08.758 --> 25:09.759
His camera.

25:12.053 --> 25:13.595
Why the camera?

25:13.596 --> 25:16.640
Probably just some
creep fanatic celebrating

25:16.641 --> 25:18.935
the anniversary
of Bailey's death.

25:20.102 --> 25:23.563
Or maybe somebody looking
to make an extra buck

25:23.564 --> 25:25.858
by appointing some
grim paraphernalia.

25:29.111 --> 25:31.321
So you still won't
consider the possibility.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.656
Of an accomplice?

25:32.657 --> 25:35.117
David we've been through this a
million times.

25:35.743 --> 25:38.788
There's no evidence that Bailey
was working with an accomplice.

25:43.417 --> 25:45.126
If someone else was involved,

25:45.127 --> 25:47.880
wouldn't there have been
another disappearance by now?

25:50.174 --> 25:52.425
Unless they saw
what happened to Bailey

25:52.426 --> 25:53.427
and they're just laying low.

25:54.929 --> 25:58.057
David I told you to
trust me I can handle it.

25:58.599 --> 25:59.684
Go on your vacation.

26:03.896 --> 26:04.896
Officer

26:04.897 --> 26:08.275
Martin said someone tampered
with the security footage.

26:08.276 --> 26:10.110
Are you sure whoever did
this didn't,

26:10.111 --> 26:11.112
you know,

26:11.696 --> 26:13.196
have help from the inside?

26:13.197 --> 26:15.282
You're seeing ghosts
where there aren't any David.

26:15.283 --> 26:16.158
I.T.

26:16.159 --> 26:17.659
IS LOOKING AT THE FOOTAGE NOW.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.619
THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU
TO BE HERE.

26:19.620 --> 26:20.621
We

26:25.042 --> 26:28.461
Put out an alert to local
camera specialist,

26:28.462 --> 26:29.422
pawnshops,

26:29.423 --> 26:31.631
and thrift shops
with the description

26:31.632 --> 26:32.841
of the camera.

26:32.842 --> 26:35.386
We've already got a lead
on a pawnshop in town.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.972
Did you know that the Japanese
government is getting

26:38.973 --> 26:41.349
involved to try and stop people
from working

26:41.350 --> 26:42.059
themselves to death.

26:42.060 --> 26:45.104
They want people to take
more vacation days.

26:45.980 --> 26:46.981
Really?

26:49.442 --> 26:50.443
Does it work?

26:50.985 --> 26:53.029
Well, not yet.

26:59.618 --> 27:00.618
Hey,

27:00.619 --> 27:02.288
What's the name
of that pawnshop?

27:19.430 --> 27:21.431
We still have plenty of time
to make the show,

27:21.432 --> 27:22.516
okay?

27:26.854 --> 27:29.773
Look if for some reason
we don't make the show

27:29.774 --> 27:32.442
I will fly you to wherever
they're touring next.

27:32.443 --> 27:33.611
London?

27:34.445 --> 27:35.862
In the US.

27:35.863 --> 27:37.239
That's not until forever.

27:38.824 --> 27:40.284
Then we better
not miss this show huh?

27:43.120 --> 27:44.162
No no.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.455
I gotta make one more stop.

27:45.456 --> 27:46.457
Dad!

27:46.999 --> 27:47.666
Hey guys,

27:49.210 --> 27:50.211
check this out.

28:26.414 --> 28:27.914
You're my man.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.374
Don't talk about it.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.959
Not my man-man
but like my wingman.

28:30.960 --> 28:31.961
Don't talk about it.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.754
I see you push me
in the corner over here.

28:34.755 --> 28:36.089
You scared?

28:36.090 --> 28:37.507
I'm a little bit intimidated.

28:37.508 --> 28:38.508
Scared?

28:38.509 --> 28:39.551
I wouldn't say scared,

28:39.552 --> 28:40.885
but it's intimidating.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.345
I'll back off.

28:42.346 --> 28:43.847
I don't want to intimidate you.

28:43.848 --> 28:44.866
No no no no.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.391
I didn't say you should back
off.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.393
Oh yeah?

28:48.894 --> 28:49.894
Sorry.

28:49.895 --> 28:50.229
Sorry.

28:55.401 --> 28:56.401
Sorry.

28:56.402 --> 28:57.569
It was the wind.

28:57.570 --> 28:58.821
The wind.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.239
All right.

29:01.240 --> 29:02.449
Everyone over here.

29:02.450 --> 29:03.909
We need a group pic.

29:05.327 --> 29:06.619
One after we swim?

29:06.620 --> 29:07.621
Yes.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.290
All right.

29:10.291 --> 29:11.584
Everyone get in here.

29:13.169 --> 29:14.169
Smile.

29:14.170 --> 29:15.004
Nice and big.

29:15.004 --> 29:15.671
One.

29:15.671 --> 29:16.464
Two.

29:16.465 --> 29:17.465
Three.

29:19.175 --> 29:20.175
Is that it?

29:20.176 --> 29:21.259
That's it!

29:21.260 --> 29:22.760
Wait, it will come out.

29:22.761 --> 29:23.095
It will come out.

29:35.024 --> 29:36.025
Hello?

29:37.318 --> 29:39.319
No, she was there when I left.

29:39.320 --> 29:40.654
Everything all right?

29:43.324 --> 29:44.532
No that's fine I'll head home.

29:44.533 --> 29:45.700
It's fine.

29:45.701 --> 29:47.869
I'll see you in a bit.

29:47.870 --> 29:49.621
Is everything okay?

29:49.622 --> 29:50.414
Yeah.

29:50.415 --> 29:51.915
My parents can't find my sister.

29:51.916 --> 29:52.999
It's fine though you know
she goes out all

29:53.000 --> 29:53.501
the time without telling us.

29:53.502 --> 29:55.418
I'll be back, okay?

29:55.419 --> 29:56.295
Do you want me to come with?

29:56.295 --> 29:57.171
No, I'll be fine.

29:57.172 --> 29:58.880
Just keep an eye
on the horndogs.

29:58.881 --> 30:00.173
Hey Kai!

30:00.174 --> 30:01.633
Don't forget to wrap
it up buddy.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.093
Oh, hey.

30:03.094 --> 30:04.094
I got the whole thing timed out,

30:04.095 --> 30:05.303
don't worry buddy.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.013
Oh shit.

30:07.014 --> 30:08.015
Oooooh okay.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.099
What?

30:10.100 --> 30:11.060
What?

30:11.894 --> 30:13.019
I think that's a skill.

30:13.020 --> 30:13.979
All right?

30:40.214 --> 30:42.079
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

30:42.091 --> 30:42.716
Don't drown.

30:46.929 --> 30:50.432
But seriously I'll kill you.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.489
Jen.

35:59.533 --> 36:00.533
Jen where you've been,

36:00.534 --> 36:01.660
mom and dad have
been worried sick.

36:03.245 --> 36:04.246
Jen.

36:40.240 --> 36:46.163
So you know how people
after sex always have to pee?

37:15.442 --> 37:16.651
Hi there, sir.

37:16.652 --> 37:17.777
What brings you in today?

37:17.778 --> 37:20.364
I was wondering have
you received any cameras lately?

37:20.989 --> 37:23.449
Well we do receive a
few cameras every few days.

37:23.450 --> 37:26.369
This would've been
this morning or yesterday.

37:26.370 --> 37:27.079
It's a Polaroid.

37:30.082 --> 37:33.168
Man, sure is
windy out, isn't it.

37:35.212 --> 37:38.297
Well now that you mentioned
it we actually did receive

37:38.298 --> 37:40.091
a report for a missing camera.

37:40.092 --> 37:41.759
But why do you want it?

37:41.760 --> 37:43.053
I'm with the police.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.847
Well how am I
supposed to know that sir.

37:49.685 --> 37:52.687
Well we did have one
but we sold it earlier.

37:52.688 --> 37:53.688
Who did you sell to?

37:53.689 --> 37:54.730
Uh.

37:54.731 --> 37:55.148
I don't know.

37:55.149 --> 37:56.691
She didn't leave a name
or anything.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.151
She paid in cash.

37:59.319 --> 38:01.654
Oh well we do have
security cameras.

38:01.655 --> 38:03.156
Did you want to maybe
check that out?

38:03.991 --> 38:04.992
That'd be great.

39:24.237 --> 39:26.572
So how do you know Alex?

39:26.573 --> 39:27.949
Actually I just
met him this year.

39:29.576 --> 39:30.577
We met at school.

39:49.304 --> 39:51.515
Hey, you okay?

42:03.647 --> 42:04.647
Oh!

42:04.648 --> 42:06.191
What happened?

42:06.483 --> 42:07.483
I don't know.

42:07.484 --> 42:08.443
What?

42:08.444 --> 42:11.195
Can you tell me
something about her...

42:11.196 --> 42:14.908
maybe something she was wearing
or personality or something.

42:15.575 --> 42:16.951
She was really quick witted.

42:16.952 --> 42:18.370
Shit.

42:22.499 --> 42:23.499
She might.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.501
Think about it.

42:25.001 --> 42:27.169
Oh she was uh she
was wearing a black dress.

42:27.170 --> 42:27.963
I know who it is.

42:31.591 --> 42:33.550
Dad!

42:33.551 --> 42:34.552
Morgan!

42:39.891 --> 42:40.891
What is it?

42:40.892 --> 42:41.893
What's wrong?

42:44.271 --> 42:45.897
I'm here just tell me
what you saw.

42:53.321 --> 42:53.863
Courtney?

43:02.372 --> 43:03.540
Fuck.

43:10.213 --> 43:12.716
Judy!

43:21.433 --> 43:21.933
Courtney!

43:21.933 --> 43:22.475
Courtney!

43:46.791 --> 43:48.460
Violet!

43:55.300 --> 43:56.967
What did you do?

43:56.968 --> 43:57.969
It

43:58.553 --> 43:59.554
Was an accident.

44:02.390 --> 44:03.391
It was an accident.

44:03.725 --> 44:05.727
She must have fallen.

44:13.693 --> 44:14.861
Why why did you do that?

44:16.196 --> 44:17.197
Evidence.

44:18.323 --> 44:19.323
I didn't do it.

44:19.324 --> 44:21.785
Kennedy, I didn't do it.

44:23.703 --> 44:26.456
Morgan please help me.

44:32.212 --> 44:33.213
I saw.

44:35.673 --> 44:36.674
I don't know.

44:37.842 --> 44:38.843
It looked like

44:41.513 --> 44:42.639
you won't believe me.

44:48.478 --> 44:51.356
It looked like one of the kids
from the Old Bailey murders.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.150
I know it sounds crazy.

45:02.784 --> 45:03.785
Can we go?

45:20.510 --> 45:22.804
Can we still go to the concert?

45:28.017 --> 45:29.769
I have to go back to
the house to find Violet.

46:12.020 --> 46:13.353
Kennedy!

46:13.354 --> 46:14.396
Kennedy!

46:14.397 --> 46:16.483
I didn't do

46:37.003 --> 46:38.003
it.

46:38.004 --> 46:39.088
Stop blaming me.

46:40.131 --> 46:41.131
I saw you!

46:41.132 --> 46:42.133
I have evidence!

46:44.010 --> 46:45.010
No.

46:45.011 --> 46:46.846
Kennedy get the fucking picture.

46:52.143 --> 46:54.145
Just give me the
fucking picture.

46:56.523 --> 46:57.524
I'm not giving it back.

47:42.694 --> 47:43.694
Hey.

47:43.695 --> 47:44.903
Do you even know

47:44.904 --> 47:46.071
what vacation means?

47:46.072 --> 47:47.073
I think I have a lead.

47:47.991 --> 47:50.576
Send a car over to the
Tigard pawnshop and pick

47:50.577 --> 47:51.702
up the owner for questioning.

47:51.703 --> 47:52.245
Funny thing,

47:52.246 --> 47:54.955
I'm standing in the pawnshop
now it's empty.

47:54.956 --> 47:57.750
Door was wide open
but nobody's home.

48:04.215 --> 48:06.008
I'll call you back.

48:06.009 --> 48:07.010
Guys.

48:08.511 --> 48:13.725
He killed Violet and Courtney.
He was gonna kill me.

48:14.767 --> 48:17.519
Kennedy, those things outside.

48:17.520 --> 48:18.771
What?

48:22.567 --> 48:25.277
There's beasts
and outside right now.

48:25.278 --> 48:29.282
Is he dead?

48:36.372 --> 48:38.041
Violet and
Courtney are dead too.

48:39.459 --> 48:40.460
He killed them.

48:40.835 --> 48:41.877
No fuck Kennedy.

48:41.878 --> 48:43.086
KENNEDY No it wasn't him.

48:43.087 --> 48:44.296
It was those fuckin beasts.

48:44.297 --> 48:45.256
What?

48:45.257 --> 48:46.632
Was fucking forest beasts.

48:46.633 --> 48:47.758
What the fuck
are you talking about.

48:47.759 --> 48:49.134
They're out there,

48:49.135 --> 48:50.970
I'll fucking prove
it you... okay here.

48:50.971 --> 48:52.304
Call the police.

48:52.305 --> 48:53.889
Well what are you gonna do.

48:53.890 --> 48:55.183
I'm going to
fucking get a photo.

50:31.863 --> 50:33.865
You going to be okay?

50:35.241 --> 50:36.242
Yeah.

50:37.410 --> 50:38.619
I probably just scared myself.

51:11.527 --> 51:12.528
Kennedy.

51:18.034 --> 51:19.035
Kennedy.

51:36.427 --> 51:38.304
Kennedy, it's your dad,

51:38.305 --> 51:39.305
give me a call.

52:53.963 --> 52:56.132
Would you mind waiting
here in case to come home.

52:57.717 --> 52:58.926
I gotta go look for them.

52:59.468 --> 53:01.345
I want to stop by Courtney
see if they're there.

53:02.805 --> 53:04.515
I need to talk to Violet
about her camera.

53:18.946 --> 53:21.281
Look keep the door locked.

53:21.282 --> 53:23.033
Call me immediately
if they come home.

53:23.034 --> 53:30.958
But can't I come with you?
I'm scared.

53:32.919 --> 53:33.920
But if they come home.

53:36.547 --> 53:37.548
I know.

53:38.090 --> 53:39.257
Just be home soon.

53:39.258 --> 53:40.301
Okay?

54:50.788 --> 54:52.122
Oh hey David,

54:52.123 --> 54:53.164
I thought it was Courtney.

54:53.165 --> 54:54.583
She's always forgetting
her keys.

54:55.543 --> 54:56.668
Courtney is not here.

54:56.669 --> 54:58.044
No I thought she was at your

54:58.045 --> 54:59.255
house with her friends.

55:02.008 --> 55:03.299
Well they were
supposed to be there.

55:03.300 --> 55:06.846
They might be at Alex's house.

55:07.847 --> 55:08.888
Do you know parents?

55:08.889 --> 55:10.975
No I've never met them.

55:13.060 --> 55:16.396
I think his father's
name is Greg or something

55:16.397 --> 55:17.689
like that.

55:17.690 --> 55:19.733
You know
it's not like Courtney to run

55:19.734 --> 55:21.318
off somewhere and not tell me.

55:21.944 --> 55:23.487
Do you think everything's fine?

55:30.161 --> 55:31.579
I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

57:26.527 --> 57:27.903
Yeah.

57:29.113 --> 57:30.948
Hey I'm uh I'm David,

57:31.657 --> 57:32.658
Kennedy's dad.

57:33.242 --> 57:35.244
I think we've might
have met... uh.

57:35.828 --> 57:36.995
Greg?

57:36.996 --> 57:37.997
Steve.

57:38.789 --> 57:40.456
You want to tell me why
the hell you're knocking

57:40.457 --> 57:42.501
on my door at this hour?

57:43.752 --> 57:48.339
You wouldn't by chance
have seen Alex or Kennedy

57:48.340 --> 57:49.341
or the rest of them?

57:49.925 --> 57:50.926
No.

57:52.678 --> 57:54.305
No phone calls?

57:55.264 --> 57:56.265
No.

58:02.479 --> 58:03.480
Sorry to wake you.

59:06.877 --> 59:07.878
BAILEY?

59:40.452 --> 59:41.453
Alex?

59:42.496 --> 59:43.580
Where's my sister?

59:47.167 --> 59:48.210
Where's my sister?

01:00:39.386 --> 01:00:40.387
Hello.

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:42.890
Hey dad, where are you?

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.225
I'm at Alex's.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:46.893
Kennedy stop by yet?

01:00:46.894 --> 01:00:48.936
No, but I found Alex.

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:50.188
Where was he?

01:00:50.189 --> 01:00:51.189
Did he find the others?

01:00:51.190 --> 01:00:52.607
No.

01:00:52.608 --> 01:00:55.944
Dad, he's scared out of his mind

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:58.906
and it's scaring me.

01:01:02.826 --> 01:01:03.827
Are you gonna be okay?

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.246
I don't know.

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:09.666
I'll be... I'm fine.

01:01:11.293 --> 01:01:12.294
He needs help.

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:13.879
All right.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.505
Well don't worry.

01:01:15.506 --> 01:01:16.965
I'll be... I'll be
there soon okay?

01:01:38.237 --> 01:01:40.905
Let's go downstairs
and make you some tea.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:42.241
Get you some tea.

01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:32.661
What is it?

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.370
Amelia,

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.872
I need back up at
the Bailey house.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:37.749
What's going on?

01:04:38.792 --> 01:04:39.793
David?

01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:58.747
Alex!

01:05:59.915 --> 01:06:02.167
Alex!

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:30.946
What did you do?

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:36.326
WHAT DID YOU DO?

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:25.416
Kennedy!

01:07:25.417 --> 01:07:26.752
Morgan! Thank god.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:29.420
We have to go.

01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:30.005
We have to go now.

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:33.109
Kennedy?

01:08:36.696 --> 01:08:37.697
Morgan?

01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:41.868
What did you see?

01:08:46.747 --> 01:08:47.749
Where's Alex?

01:08:54.798 --> 01:08:55.506
We have to go!

01:08:55.508 --> 01:08:56.508
No!

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.010
Go!

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.179
Shhh.

01:09:01.179 --> 01:09:02.055
No need for that.

01:09:02.055 --> 01:09:04.390
I'm going to take
care of you now.

01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:45.848
I love it, you know.

01:09:45.849 --> 01:09:47.017
Blood pumping.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.060
Heart racing.

01:09:49.978 --> 01:09:51.270
Knowing what you're going to do.

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:56.610
Waiting until you can't
hold out any longer.

01:09:57.903 --> 01:09:59.194
Please!

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.447
Please just let me go.

01:10:01.656 --> 01:10:02.657
No!

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:39.860
Oh no!

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:41.362
We have to go.

01:10:41.363 --> 01:10:42.364
We have to go.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.081
I love you.

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:35.041
I love you too.

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.324
The back!

01:12:32.599 --> 01:12:33.600
David!

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:42.484
Why?

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:43.985
The thrill.

01:12:43.986 --> 01:12:46.278
You know you felt it.

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.614
You're probably feeling it now.

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:53.078
I'm the only thing you can see.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.706
You know the moment
you pull that trigger.

01:12:57.749 --> 01:12:58.833
You can't go back.

01:13:00.335 --> 01:13:05.964
Lay your gun on the ground.
You can still walk out of this.

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:08.927
We both know we aren't
both getting out of here.

01:13:10.678 --> 01:13:11.679
So do it.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:13.388
Now's your shot.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:18.812
Those two people
you killed on duty.

01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:21.314
You're craving
that feeling again,

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:22.899
aren't you?

01:13:29.155 --> 01:13:31.115
No,

01:13:31.116 --> 01:13:33.368
because I'm not
a psychotic fuck.

01:14:17.704 --> 01:14:19.413
Wow what a show
you guys really sure

01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:20.498
do know how to rock out.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.751
I mean that was crazy.

01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:26.128
If you want to see me
again we're adding

01:14:26.129 --> 01:14:28.881
Portland to the end of our tour.

01:14:28.882 --> 01:14:31.842
If you didn't get to meet me
in Seattle we're going to double

01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:33.510
the amount of VIP tickets!

01:14:33.511 --> 01:14:34.678
Anyway,

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:37.389
I'm gonna go to bed
cause I'm really tired

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.058
otherwise I just pass out.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.102
Danny out!

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:50.528
Kennedy?

01:14:52.864 --> 01:14:53.865
Morgan?

01:15:04.918 --> 01:15:05.919
Kennedy?

01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:09.214
Morgan?

01:15:14.636 --> 01:15:15.637
Dad?

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:27.232
Where's Morgan?

01:15:28.305 --> 01:15:34.412
