Wait, let me write that.

00:01.974 --> 00:03.298
- Hold on one second.
- Okay, what's the studio?

00:03.333 --> 00:04.256
Okay, great.

00:04.291 --> 00:06.909
- I'm so glad you like this base.
- Yeah, I read that treatment.

00:06.944 --> 00:09.127
- No, it is amazing.
- Yeah, no, I hated it.

00:09.431 --> 00:12.185
- No, frankly. Plus he's designed to...
- He's a real asshole to work with.

00:12.206 --> 00:14.562
- Everybody say so.
- Absolutely. Every single aspect.

00:15.522 --> 00:18.215
Yeah, actually she pitched it
to me on my blackberry.

00:18.776 --> 00:22.211
- What? You are kiding me!
- Well, we couln't be more thrilled.

00:22.248 --> 00:23.030
Absolutely.

00:23.305 --> 00:25.165
- Half a million dollars?!
- I can't wait for you to meet Kelly.

00:25.205 --> 00:26.733
No way!

00:26.774 --> 00:28.451
- Great, we're looking forward to it.
- He's gonna be

00:28.489 --> 00:29.962
- so pissed.
- Okay, what, you know?

00:30.007 --> 00:31.823
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sure. No problem.

00:31.866 --> 00:33.250
- Alright, we'll see you then.
- Really?

00:33.298 --> 00:35.630
- Alright. Bye-bye.
- Wow! Oh my god!

00:35.668 --> 00:38.521
You two have just really moved
your offices right on in here, huh?

00:38.566 --> 00:40.820
- Wow, that's amazing.
- That's construction is a fucking nightmare.

00:40.868 --> 00:42.102
- It's so different.
- The next time I get the bright idea

00:42.138 --> 00:43.880
- to double the square foot of my house?
- Very commercial.

00:43.915 --> 00:45.422
Please, talk me out of it.

00:45.716 --> 00:47.970
Yeah, it's on tuesday.

00:47.975 --> 00:49.141
- "Traffic Light"
by the Ting Tings -

00:49.237 --> 00:51.091
- Guess what?
- What?

00:51.135 --> 00:52.672
Jenny sold her script.

00:53.008 --> 00:55.971
What? Wait... I didn't even know
she was working a screenplay.

00:56.015 --> 00:57.770
- I didn't... Yeah.
- She goes to show you.

00:57.815 --> 00:59.113
She was depressed and

00:59.118 --> 01:00.741
someone stole her movie
right of from under

01:00.805 --> 01:02.253
and she just sat
right back down and

01:02.257 --> 01:04.012
she just banged out
another script.

01:04.058 --> 01:05.500
Just cranked it out?

01:05.577 --> 01:07.092
- Good for her.
- Yeah.

01:07.137 --> 01:09.511
There was a bidding war.
Guess how much it sold for?

01:09.536 --> 01:12.441
- How much?
- Half a million dollars.

01:12.476 --> 01:15.480
No, shit! Wow!
Half a million?

01:15.516 --> 01:17.072
Yeah, you know,
I would have been on it myself,

01:17.106 --> 01:19.530
but you know Aaron,
he's such a shortsighted prig.

01:19.578 --> 01:22.082
- He hates Jenny.
- Well, that's great for her.

01:22.126 --> 01:24.040
Wonder what it's about
this time, huh?

01:24.046 --> 01:24.940
<b>MUSIC</b>

01:24.976 --> 01:26.490
Should I be worried? I mean,
did she go through the garbage

01:26.557 --> 01:28.903
to make a pull new set of lies
about our relationship?

01:28.946 --> 01:31.001
No, this one's completely
different.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.531
It's an action-comedy

01:32.566 --> 01:35.373
about a talk show host
and a cop.

01:35.406 --> 01:38.710
And the talk show host gets
embroiled in this like murder mystery,

01:38.756 --> 01:41.041
but the movie really revolves
around the romance

01:41.056 --> 01:43.100
between the talk show host
and the cop.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.710
It's kinda like a foul play,

01:44.748 --> 01:47.040
- meets, uh...
- "Mr and Mrs Smith"?

01:47.078 --> 01:49.540
Yeah, sort of.
So, for this it's gonna be

01:49.577 --> 01:51.362
huge. It's a great concept.

01:51.407 --> 01:54.331
- Oh my... You guys!
- Big blockbuster potential.

01:55.918 --> 01:57.511
That's my story!

01:57.555 --> 01:58.481
- What?
- What?

01:58.527 --> 02:00.501
That's, that's my story!

03:27.648 --> 03:29.880
{a6}The treatment that I gave you
about the screenplay

03:29.918 --> 03:31.381
{a6}that I was gonna write!
With the,

03:31.415 --> 03:33.402
{a6}with the talk show host
who falls for the cop,

{a6}who, who gets involved
in a murder plot.

03:35.967 --> 03:37.411
{a6}I believe,
if I remember right,

03:37.487 --> 03:38.953
{a6}you said
it was a terrible idea.

03:38.985 --> 03:40.631
{a6}I think your exact words were

03:40.665 --> 03:42.942
{a6}contrived, boring,

03:42.988 --> 03:44.012
{a6}unsellable?

03:44.057 --> 03:47.163
Right. That jumble of ideas
that you gave me?

03:47.207 --> 03:49.582
- The treatment, yes.
- Oh, Alice.

03:49.616 --> 03:51.913
In no universe would that
mish-mash of ideas

03:51.918 --> 03:54.400
be considered a sellable treatment,
and for your information,

03:54.438 --> 03:56.531
{a6}I've been working
on a screenplay of my own

03:56.567 --> 03:59.642
{a6}for the last couple of
months and if it happens to bear

03:59.677 --> 04:02.231
{a6}some ressemblance to
something that your jotted down

04:02.278 --> 04:03.973
{a6}then it's pure coincidence.

04:04.487 --> 04:06.803
{a6}- Oh my god!
- It happens all the time in Hollywood.

04:06.845 --> 04:09.301
{a6}Where people steal
their friends' ideas and then

04:09.336 --> 04:11.113
they sell them off as their own.
Is that what you're trying to say?

04:11.147 --> 04:13.723
No, it's something called
the idea well, okay?

04:13.768 --> 04:15.213
- Oh my god...
- There is a well.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.930
{a6}All of the writers
drink from the same fountain.

04:17.976 --> 04:19.410
{a6}Okay? But,

04:19.454 --> 04:23.050
{a6}it takes genius, talent,
craftsmanship,

04:23.088 --> 04:25.001
{a6}to take a kernel
of an idea

04:25.037 --> 04:26.571
{a6}and turn it into,

04:26.608 --> 04:29.823
{a6}tada!
A sellable screenplay, okay?

04:29.866 --> 04:33.821
Jenny, you are
so fucking full of shit!

04:33.856 --> 04:35.403
Hey, what's going on?

04:35.447 --> 04:36.403
Hi.

04:36.408 --> 04:38.423
She's crossed the fucking line,
Shane. She has

04:38.468 --> 04:40.991
fucking crossed it. I...

04:58.397 --> 05:02.770
I don't... I guess she has
some misguided idea that

05:03.376 --> 05:05.893
I stole the idea of
her screenplay.

05:05.926 --> 05:06.901
I don't know.

05:08.165 --> 05:09.850
She is pissed off!

05:11.086 --> 05:13.172

to get over it.

"It happens to be similar".</i>

I feel bad about this.

05:26.915 --> 05:28.653
Because I'm the one
that sent you...

05:30.878 --> 05:33.091
It's not your fault. I mean,
how were we supposed to know

05:33.138 --> 05:35.193
that she was gonna fucking
screw me over like that?

05:35.235 --> 05:36.432
Can you sue her? I mean,

05:36.465 --> 05:38.022
does Joyce do
copy right infrigement?

05:38.057 --> 05:39.210
No, it doesn't work that way.

- What are you gonna do?
- I don't...

05:41.068 --> 05:43.383
I can't even talk about it
anymore. It's just like I'm...

You know what I mean?

05:45.597 --> 05:47.153
Why are you guys still here?

05:47.615 --> 05:49.970
I'm working from home
and yet I have no home...

05:50.525 --> 05:52.802
And ever since I've been accused
of stealing the negative,

05:52.835 --> 05:55.102
it's too uncomfortable
to go to the office.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.010
So, I'm just avoiding it.

05:57.045 --> 05:58.720
I only have to go back
later on the day.

06:03.018 --> 06:03.980
- What?
- What?

06:04.995 --> 06:06.601
Oh, I'm going to Hit tonight,
you guys,

06:06.605 --> 06:08.253
with Tasha and Jamie,
if you wanna go.

06:08.288 --> 06:09.651
Is Jamie that girl

06:09.695 --> 06:11.941
that you guys have been
hanging out with all the time?

06:11.975 --> 06:13.121
Oh my... Yes!

06:13.168 --> 06:14.782
Yeah. She's

06:14.826 --> 06:16.991
awesome!
She's so cool, you guys.

06:17.035 --> 06:19.240
We actually went to that sushi bar
you were telling me about,

06:19.258 --> 06:21.190
on Mandchura. It was fun.

06:22.905 --> 06:23.735
What?

06:23.765 --> 06:28.253
You're having a third wheel crush.

06:28.284 --> 06:30.661
- You and Tasha.
- Yeah, definitively.

06:30.669 --> 06:32.073
Oh my god... We're...

06:32.077 --> 06:33.552
Just friends.

06:34.206 --> 06:35.411
She's a friend.

We love her as in friend love.

06:37.665 --> 06:39.563
- It's friend love.
- You so are!

06:39.575 --> 06:41.203
You have
all the telltale signs.

06:41.247 --> 06:43.581
Signs, Bette? Really?
What signs?

06:43.625 --> 06:45.481
Well, let's see.
It starts when,

06:45.516 --> 06:47.203
you know, you've been dating
your partner for quite a while

06:47.235 --> 06:49.293
and you're starting
to go bored with one another

06:49.335 --> 06:52.520
and then you start fighting
all the time.

06:52.607 --> 06:53.721
We're not fighting.

06:54.037 --> 06:55.402
- What?
- Wait...

06:55.896 --> 06:58.002
I mean, there's a little bit
of fighting. Maybe.

06:59.077 --> 07:00.923
And then
you meet a new person,

07:00.968 --> 07:04.010
and you start hanging out
all the time, the three of you,

07:04.046 --> 07:05.591
doing everything together,
and you know what?

07:05.626 --> 07:07.820
It's just great.
And this new person

07:07.828 --> 07:09.633
starts to revatalize
the relationship,

07:09.675 --> 07:11.801
pouring all this energy
and then excitment into it.

07:11.846 --> 07:14.263
And this syndrome?
It can last

07:15.008 --> 07:16.781
weeks, months,

07:16.816 --> 07:18.753
or even

07:18.785 --> 07:19.722
like...

07:20.306 --> 07:22.401
- Remember Sally?
- Go-Go Lisa?

07:23.156 --> 07:25.040
- That almost lasted the year.
- I know.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.801
Just as long as it doesn't end...

07:27.226 --> 07:28.121
- tip.
- Tip.

07:28.165 --> 07:29.151

07:29.196 --> 07:31.223
Well, when one member
of the couple, you know,

07:31.805 --> 07:34.700
falls in love with the third wheel
and then decides to act on it.

07:34.735 --> 07:36.001
Because then...

07:36.035 --> 07:37.923
- What, Bette?
- Well...

07:37.925 --> 07:39.930
You're so wrong!

07:39.965 --> 07:41.713
I can't even tell you
how wrong you are!

07:41.747 --> 07:44.432
So you just check yourself
before you wreck yourself.

07:45.027 --> 07:47.152
- Come on.
- What?

07:47.187 --> 07:50.861
We think that Tasha and Alice
are having a third wheel cruch with

07:50.906 --> 07:52.253

08:34.366 --> 08:36.393
has colonized my thoughts.

- Really? Colonized?

terrible idea. I mean,

shouldn't you just make
a little bit of an effort to know?

- Know what?
- Know that she's not gonna

who just happened to get

09:28.205 --> 09:30.822
wrapped up with the wrong guy
who made her steal the money?

09:30.857 --> 09:32.563
Oh yeah, that's good a test.

09:32.597 --> 09:34.401
Wait, you can't test Dylan.

09:34.436 --> 09:36.353
What?
There's a test for eveything.

09:36.385 --> 09:38.613
- What would it look like?
- A love test?

09:38.648 --> 09:40.620
No, it's more like a

09:40.658 --> 09:42.042
test of character.

09:42.076 --> 09:43.391
Yes, thank you.

09:43.425 --> 09:45.412
'Cause there's things
we need to know, right?

09:46.196 --> 09:49.101
I mean, one, is Dylan
just after you for the money.

09:49.765 --> 09:51.992
Two, is she still a conniving
ambitious

09:51.997 --> 09:54.273
<b>who'd do anything to
advance her career up and...</b>

09:54.316 --> 09:55.742
or has she really changed?

09:55.838 --> 09:58.643
Three, does she love you,
and only you,

09:58.687 --> 10:00.111
or would she love anyone

10:00.208 --> 10:01.942
rich enough or pretty enough to

10:01.977 --> 10:03.110
<b>offer her...</b>

10:04.065 --> 10:07.152
What if we hire an escort
to seduce Dylan?

10:07.196 --> 10:09.112
<b>No, that would just prove
she's a...</b>

10:09.148 --> 10:10.832
It's gotta be something bigger.

10:11.327 --> 10:13.471
Like someone that
would advance her career.

10:13.506 --> 10:15.270
That sort of thing, you know?

10:23.078 --> 10:24.353
Nikki Stevens.

10:28.965 --> 10:30.131
I mean, I think, really

10:30.175 --> 10:33.130
this whole thing is incredibly
juvenile and ill-advised, but...

10:33.137 --> 10:34.390
But?

10:36.887 --> 10:39.062
You know, if you want to ensnare
Dylan in some kinda test

10:39.086 --> 10:41.162
what would do is to get Niki
to pretend that she is in this

10:41.198 --> 10:43.052
big movie
and she is interested

10:43.088 --> 10:44.513
in having Dylan direct it.

10:44.608 --> 10:47.171
I mean, it'd be tempting, right?
For a struggling film maker?

10:47.217 --> 10:50.022
That would be great.
Nikki is huge right now

10:50.045 --> 10:53.060
so that would be a major
payday for any new director.

10:53.107 --> 10:55.033
And then we can have Nikki
hit on her

10:55.096 --> 10:57.702
and then see if she sells Helena
out for the big time. Yes!

10:58.615 --> 11:00.223
I don't know. I mean,

11:00.577 --> 11:02.791
you just seem a little
over the top?

11:02.815 --> 11:04.423
Don't you just wanna know?

11:04.465 --> 11:07.181
I mean, don't you just
really wanna know

11:07.206 --> 11:10.082
who's you're dealing with?
Once and for all?

11:10.678 --> 11:13.492
Come on, it'll give you
peace of mind.

11:16.136 --> 11:17.952
<b>MUSIC??????</b>

11:20.027 --> 11:21.252
I suppose

11:22.337 --> 11:25.911
I'd be curious to see
what would happen.

11:25.915 --> 11:28.170
- That's the spirit! Yes!
- This is absurd.

11:28.216 --> 11:30.193
- It will be fun.
- This is gonna happen tonight.

11:30.228 --> 11:31.720
- It has to.
- We can't. We've got a dinner.

11:31.755 --> 11:34.741
But it has to be tonight.
Her dinner with Dylan is tomorrow.

11:34.748 --> 11:36.231
Yeah, you guys.
Tonight, for sure.

11:36.265 --> 11:38.381
Okay. The only thing is
somebody needs to call Nikki.

11:38.416 --> 11:39.380
Tina knows her.

11:39.415 --> 11:41.733
Yeah, I do. But she's not
gonna do it for me.

11:41.766 --> 11:43.990
We have to bring in
Shane and Jenny on this one.

11:44.038 --> 11:46.332
I'm not talking to them
right now. Especially not Jenny.

11:46.345 --> 11:49.100
- Fine, I'll do it.
- Doesn't Jenny hate Nikki?

11:49.147 --> 11:51.553
Yeah, but she loves intrigue.

11:51.588 --> 11:53.340
And she doesn't have
to have any contact with Nikki.

11:53.358 --> 11:55.023
All she has to do

11:55.528 --> 11:58.473
is impersonate her manager.

11:59.407 --> 12:02.393
This is how
this is all gonna go now.

12:04.545 --> 12:05.701
<i>Shane will go</i>

12:05.735 --> 12:07.761
<i>and talk to Nikki on the set
of her latest movie.</i>

12:07.806 --> 12:09.363
<i>Nikki still a hot for Shane.</i>

12:09.377 --> 12:11.662
<i>So it should be easy for Shane
to convince her.</i>

12:12.045 --> 12:15.050
So you want me
to seduce some girl for you?

12:15.085 --> 12:16.530
Yeah, but
no need to sleep with her.

12:16.578 --> 12:18.171
We just wanna check
if she's gonna be into it.

12:19.068 --> 12:21.083
And what's in it for me?

12:21.477 --> 12:23.642
Just the knowledge
that you're helping a friend.

12:24.406 --> 12:27.093
Well, I can think of more
fun ways to help you, Shane.

12:29.005 --> 12:30.163
Thanks, Nikk.

12:30.196 --> 12:31.241
No problem.

12:32.578 --> 12:37.100
<i>And then I will corral Jenny
to impersonate Nikki's manager.</i>

12:37.137 --> 12:39.330
<i>Jenny's had enough
runnings with her, so,</i>

12:39.365 --> 12:40.662
<i>she should do a good job.</i>

12:40.675 --> 12:43.383
Nikki Stevens is hot, hot, hot.

12:43.415 --> 12:45.013
She is turbo hot.

12:45.047 --> 12:47.373
She is so hot,
I'm getting hot flashes.

12:47.406 --> 12:49.370
So I say to her
"Who do you wanna work with?"

12:49.408 --> 12:51.902
Who do you want
to work with? Spielberg?

12:51.936 --> 12:54.771
Do you want to work with
Scorsese?

12:54.808 --> 12:56.431
- Soderberg.
- Soderberg?

12:56.466 --> 12:58.450
And you know what
she says to me? Shes says no.

12:58.495 --> 13:00.480
That's not who I wanna
work with.

13:00.517 --> 13:02.053
I wanna work with

13:02.098 --> 13:04.203
Dylan Moreland.

13:06.527 --> 13:11.103
It's weird. I've only directed
a few obscur documentaries.

13:11.135 --> 13:12.751
<i>She loves your documentaries!</i>

13:12.795 --> 13:15.261
<i>She fucking loved
your documentaries!</i>

13:15.297 --> 13:18.292
So basically, here's the deal.
Nikki has a pep project, okay?

13:18.336 --> 13:20.063
I want you to read it and...

13:20.105 --> 13:21.443
- There's money.
- So...

13:21.486 --> 13:23.841
And you will also
get lots of money.

13:23.877 --> 13:25.153
Okay, well, you know what?

13:25.155 --> 13:26.802
We don't, we don't
have to talk about the money

13:26.895 --> 13:28.463
right now, but,

13:28.495 --> 13:30.400
you know, I think
I just need to read the script.

13:30.445 --> 13:32.121
I'll messenger it to you tonight.

13:32.167 --> 13:34.861
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
go meet her at

13:34.908 --> 13:36.622
- Hit.
- Really?

13:36.667 --> 13:37.921
She wants to meet at Hit?

13:37.936 --> 13:40.210
Yeah, she definitively wants
to meet at Hit

13:40.258 --> 13:42.013
- because she is, uh...
- Young.

13:42.048 --> 13:43.993
Young! She likes to party.

13:44.027 --> 13:46.982
And she is a whipper-snapper.
What are you gonna do?

13:48.498 --> 13:49.950
<i>I'll meet her there.</i>

13:49.987 --> 13:52.560
<i>Dylan will then call Helena
because at this point</i>

13:52.605 --> 13:54.482
<i>she's still playing
both ends against the middle.</i>

13:54.517 --> 13:57.071
<i><b>She won't wanna upset Helena.
Not before she's... Nikki.</b></i>

Hello? The Planet?

14:03.307 --> 14:04.382
Listen, um...

14:04.407 --> 14:07.530
I just got this really odd call
from Nikki Stevens' manager.

14:07.577 --> 14:10.230
Nikki Stevens, the film star?

14:10.265 --> 14:11.502
Yeah, I know, it's uh...

14:11.537 --> 14:14.151
It's kind of strange, but,

14:14.198 --> 14:17.690
she wants to meet me
tonight at your club

14:17.737 --> 14:19.622
about a possible
directing job.

14:21.028 --> 14:23.502
Right. No, I mean,
I'm sure that'll be fine.

14:23.547 --> 14:25.871
It's an exciting
opportunity for you.

14:26.806 --> 14:28.801
We're still on for dinner
tomorrow night?

14:28.838 --> 14:30.572
If you don't get a better offer.

14:37.597 --> 14:39.352
We just wait and see now.

14:40.358 --> 14:42.051
<b>MUSIC????</b>

14:47.006 --> 14:49.251
- You just missed Tina.
- I did?

14:49.285 --> 14:50.372
Yes.

14:51.077 --> 14:52.382
I'm tired.

14:52.418 --> 14:54.390
Oh, guess what. She

14:56.425 --> 14:57.492
and Alice

14:59.105 --> 15:02.673
went kick, concoted
this very silly scheme.

15:02.707 --> 15:07.020
Well, they're trying to get
Nikki to hook up with Dylan.

15:07.028 --> 15:08.860
- I know.
- You know.

15:10.465 --> 15:11.780
They brought me in.

15:11.828 --> 15:12.981
- They did?
- Yeah.

15:13.015 --> 15:13.803
How?

15:13.848 --> 15:16.071
I'm doing that job on Paramel.

15:17.076 --> 15:19.811
So Alice asked me to stop by
the studio of Nikki's movie.

15:20.366 --> 15:22.433
- What?
- To see if she wanted to go out tonight.

15:26.618 --> 15:29.931
- You saw Nikki?
- Yeah, for about 5 minutes.

15:30.578 --> 15:32.961
She seemed into though.
I think she's gonna come out.

15:35.067 --> 15:36.113
Well, you can't,

15:36.806 --> 15:38.291
you can't do that.

15:39.365 --> 15:40.360
Do what?

15:42.015 --> 15:43.063
You can't

15:43.528 --> 15:45.711
see Nikki. I forbid it.

15:46.958 --> 15:48.682
- You forbid it?
- Yeah!

15:49.185 --> 15:50.971
She betrayed us.

15:51.356 --> 15:54.572
So you shouldn't go talking
to her like it's no big deal.

15:55.326 --> 15:56.720
It isn't a big deal.

15:58.095 --> 16:00.022
Jen, come on. I'm...

16:00.607 --> 16:01.980
There is nothing.

16:03.635 --> 16:06.092
There is nothing going on
between Nikki and I.

16:06.818 --> 16:07.931
Nothing.

16:11.055 --> 16:13.261
And trust me. I'm with you.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.240
You are?

16:14.278 --> 16:15.410
I'm with you.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.921
- You believe me?
- Yeah.

16:23.238 --> 16:24.880
So then

16:24.915 --> 16:27.580
you don't have
to talk to her again, okay?

16:28.177 --> 16:31.230
Jen, you can't forbid me
to see someone. I'm not 12.

16:31.338 --> 16:33.290
I'm gonna see her
if she's around.

16:35.438 --> 16:38.993
Obviously you can do
whatever you want.

16:39.028 --> 16:41.591
- Oh, can I?
- Yeah, you can.

16:47.136 --> 16:50.122
I just wanna say
one more thing, okay?

16:50.185 --> 16:52.473
That girl betrayed us

16:52.518 --> 16:54.170
in the most fundamental way.

16:54.218 --> 16:56.761
She threatened to destroy
the foundation of our relationship

16:56.835 --> 16:58.522
that we have created
over so many years

16:58.557 --> 16:59.713
and I hate her!

17:00.118 --> 17:02.332
I hate her so much for that.

17:02.377 --> 17:04.583
And out of loyalty to me
you should hate her too.

17:08.615 --> 17:11.450
Okay, you know what?
First of all,

17:11.487 --> 17:14.871
that was me. I'm the primary
founder in that one because

17:14.906 --> 17:16.440
she had no idea

17:16.477 --> 17:19.192
or romantic feelings
towards me. In fact,

17:19.757 --> 17:21.871
she was
profoundly in love with you.

17:22.377 --> 17:23.770
So if you're gonna blame
anybody,

17:23.806 --> 17:26.752
- you should blame me.
- I think that she seduced you

17:26.795 --> 17:30.191
and I think that she really tried
to get in between the two of us.

17:30.538 --> 17:33.783
And I think that she's trying to
get in between the two of us again.

17:34.347 --> 17:36.423
And I think that
you're letting her do it.

17:36.527 --> 17:39.292
I'm not letting her do anyhting!
What is wrong with you?

17:39.336 --> 17:40.772
I'm not

17:40.808 --> 17:42.261
being unreasonable.

17:43.768 --> 17:45.322
When I think of
the two of you together,

17:45.356 --> 17:47.580
it does make me
really uncomfortable.

17:48.678 --> 17:51.663
And you said that you wanted
our relationship to be different

17:51.698 --> 17:54.183
from all the other relationships
you've had.

17:55.878 --> 17:56.643
Right?

17:57.408 --> 17:59.970
So we both need
to make some changes, right?

18:00.018 --> 18:01.981
Which should be pretty easy.

18:02.028 --> 18:03.420
Right?

18:04.275 --> 18:07.101
Unless you still have
feelings for her. Just...

18:07.147 --> 18:08.721
I mean, I don't get it.

18:08.768 --> 18:10.382
What language do I have
to tell this to you in,

18:10.446 --> 18:12.080
so you'll get that I do not

18:12.125 --> 18:13.723
have any feelings

18:13.767 --> 18:16.731
- for Nikki.
- Okay.

18:22.036 --> 18:24.383
Then it shouldn't be difficult

18:24.416 --> 18:26.960
- never to speak to her again.
- Oh god! You know,

18:27.688 --> 18:29.232
you've gotta back off.

18:39.395 --> 18:40.910
I was wrong.

18:43.387 --> 18:45.542
- What?
- I am wrong.

18:45.586 --> 18:47.653
And I should trust you.

18:49.076 --> 18:50.412
Did you just say
what I think you said?

18:50.448 --> 18:51.803
I need to learn
how to trust you.

18:51.827 --> 18:53.292
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

18:53.335 --> 18:55.271
That's all I wanted to hear.

18:55.306 --> 18:56.780
- You have to trust me.
- Yes.

18:57.775 --> 19:00.242
- No fighting.
- No fighting. Come on.

19:08.245 --> 19:09.013
What?

19:15.448 --> 19:16.840
<b>MUSIC</b>

19:22.248 --> 19:24.371
So we were having
a fabulous time

19:24.417 --> 19:25.411
and I said

19:25.456 --> 19:27.950
Philip, you have to loosen up,
I mean,

19:27.996 --> 19:30.013
life is too short
for boring men.

19:34.045 --> 19:36.801
Bette, you never told me
your partner was such a firecracker.

19:36.848 --> 19:37.991
Oh, my god.

19:38.567 --> 19:39.741
Where did you two meet?

19:39.777 --> 19:42.352
<b>At university. Kelly was
my... in art history.</b>

19:42.407 --> 19:44.280
Oh, that is the boring answer

19:44.375 --> 19:46.041
and the theme
of the evening is...

19:46.087 --> 19:48.271
No bores!

19:48.318 --> 19:50.202
- The truth is...
- Tell me.

19:50.238 --> 19:52.120
Bette was in love with me.

19:53.896 --> 19:55.653
So were you two...

19:57.578 --> 19:58.620
- Never.
- No,

19:58.668 --> 20:00.411
I missed my big opportunity.

20:00.446 --> 20:03.113
But now she's taken
by the lovely Tina Kennard.

20:03.895 --> 20:04.970
You never know.

20:05.566 --> 20:07.200
Tina and I have been together

20:07.236 --> 20:08.251
happily

20:08.298 --> 20:11.591
- for a long, long time.
- Key word, happily.

20:12.197 --> 20:14.113
- Happily.
- Key word.

20:16.035 --> 20:17.683
So, Philip, are you uh...

20:20.086 --> 20:21.840
Oh, I'm sorry,
I've got to take this call.

20:22.295 --> 20:24.740
- Who is it?
- Excuse me. I'll be right back.

20:26.676 --> 20:28.813
I think you should just
take it down, just a

20:28.858 --> 20:30.950
- notch.
- Oh, come on, we're having fun.

20:30.998 --> 20:32.243
I know, but I don't think
it's a good idea

20:32.315 --> 20:33.840
to hit on an artist
especially a night

20:33.888 --> 20:35.413
right. before the show.

20:36.375 --> 20:39.032
Bette, I'm sorry. Can you
talk to Jason about tomorrow?

20:39.066 --> 20:40.681
- He's confused.
- Sure.

20:40.727 --> 20:41.661
Thank you.

20:41.697 --> 20:42.671
Behave yourself.

20:42.707 --> 20:44.960
Oh, I'm sorry I'm transporting

20:45.036 --> 20:47.313
a number of pieces tomorrow.
Oh, it's just...

20:47.348 --> 20:49.172
- a complete headache.
- No, no, don't worry.

20:49.215 --> 20:52.133
Bette will work it out.
She's very brilliant.

20:52.715 --> 20:53.680
- And um...
- Right.

20:53.725 --> 20:55.451
- No, that was the first time...
- Very beautiful.

20:55.487 --> 20:56.733
Always has been.

20:57.307 --> 20:59.423
- But, um...
- To me, she's

20:59.807 --> 21:01.201
the one that got away.

21:01.566 --> 21:02.641
What a shame!

21:02.678 --> 21:03.760
But, um...

21:04.385 --> 21:06.261
As you said, she is taken.

21:12.025 --> 21:15.262
Does it bother that I flirt
shamelessly with your girlfriend?

21:15.297 --> 21:17.581
No, no, flirt away.

21:17.627 --> 21:20.603
I mean, Bette knows that
if she were to ever cheat on me,

21:20.637 --> 21:22.693
then that would be
the end of us.

21:22.697 --> 21:24.351
So, if it makes you feel

21:24.385 --> 21:28.342
scandalous and sexy to tease her
with her co-oed crush,

21:28.388 --> 21:29.592
have at it.

21:30.097 --> 21:31.921
Thanks. I will.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.850
Thank you, Phylip.
What did I miss?

21:33.898 --> 21:35.173
- Nothing.
- Thank you.

21:35.716 --> 21:36.940
We were just talking.

21:41.405 --> 21:42.712
These wines...

21:44.515 --> 21:46.573
William and Aaron just
walked in

21:46.605 --> 21:49.460
with Martine Lucas and
Susan Kalogridis.

21:49.506 --> 21:50.532
They're two screenwriters

21:50.535 --> 21:53.431
that I've been working
on a project with for three years.

21:53.436 --> 21:55.860
So, what's wrong with that?

21:57.557 --> 21:59.350
I wasn't invited.

22:00.348 --> 22:03.552
That, in Hollywood, is how
you know that you've been fired.

22:15.628 --> 22:17.681
She's got cameras
in every corner of the club.

22:17.725 --> 22:18.503
Look, you can

22:19.325 --> 22:20.323
zoom in.

22:22.857 --> 22:24.631
It's got microphones.

22:24.675 --> 22:26.680
We have them placed
at every table.

22:28.087 --> 22:29.671
So you can hear everything

Every table.

22:32.296 --> 22:34.920

about you, huh?

22:37.976 --> 22:39.322
- Wow!
- Check this out!

22:40.655 --> 22:41.812
Oh my god!

22:42.498 --> 22:43.823
What is she doing here?

22:46.606 --> 22:48.880
I really don't understand
what this is all about.

22:48.957 --> 22:50.452
I just think
it's a huge misunderstanding.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.282
- I really do.
- What?!

22:52.326 --> 22:54.560
What about it
did I misunderstand?

22:54.598 --> 22:55.751
Was it when Jenny

22:56.018 --> 22:59.141
stole my idea or when she
sold it for half a million dollars?

22:59.178 --> 23:01.273
I'm sorry, I really, I can't
be around you right now.

23:01.335 --> 23:02.723
Alice, please.

23:02.768 --> 23:05.261
Please just stop
acting like a child.

23:05.307 --> 23:08.352
I did not steal your idea!

23:08.386 --> 23:11.491
Alice, was it your idea
when a terrorrist

23:11.526 --> 23:14.890
has a nuclear weapon that's
gonna blow up the building?

23:14.928 --> 23:18.083
Or was it your idea when
the hero of a romantic comedy

23:18.127 --> 23:19.260
has to rush into a wedding

23:19.295 --> 23:21.463
in order to save his beloved
from getting married? Or,

23:21.498 --> 23:23.751
wait, was "Beverly Hills Cop"
your idea too?

23:23.796 --> 23:26.562
Can you just stop
slinging your bullshit at me?

23:26.655 --> 23:29.320
I'm serious. Maybe Shane
is buying into your act,

23:29.365 --> 23:32.071
obviously she is. But I,
I see you, okay?

23:32.578 --> 23:35.032
It's like... Stay away from me
before I fucking kill you!

23:35.068 --> 23:36.722

- Okay, okay, enough already.

Why does Nikki
have your phone number?

23:54.075 --> 23:55.222
'Cause I gave it to her.

23:55.256 --> 23:58.022

- Nikki Stevens, reporting for duty.

Thanks.

25:30.226 --> 25:31.812

25:31.847 --> 25:34.672
Yeah, I'm, I'm so grateful

25:34.686 --> 25:37.762
and honestly a little surprised
that you wanted to meet with me.

25:37.798 --> 25:39.810
Oh my god, no.
I have been a fan of yours

25:39.848 --> 25:41.753
ever since I saw
"There's always something".

25:42.387 --> 25:43.852
"The other side of nothing".

25:43.887 --> 25:45.250
Right. Right.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.320
Bring it back, Nikki.
Come on.

25:49.936 --> 25:52.751
You know, it's really funny
you've picked this room.

25:52.788 --> 25:55.821
- Why?
- This happens to be my luck spot.

25:55.866 --> 25:59.052
Last week, I made out with
the most gorgeous woman ever,

25:59.086 --> 26:00.302

Martine, Suzanne, right?

27:11.247 --> 27:13.063

27:16.838 --> 27:18.582
I do not need you

- I know. I'm sorry.
- I'm so happy to be done with dykes.

27:29.086 --> 27:30.180

and wine and dine my writers
on a project

27:45.218 --> 27:46.773

to put together

27:46.776 --> 27:48.473

you're a talentless hacks.

I begged him to hire you.

time and time in again.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.522
And how do you repay me?

28:03.556 --> 28:06.363
By stealing my contacts
and icing me.

28:06.405 --> 28:09.301
- Tina, keep your voice down.
- Shut your piehole, Aaron!

<b>MUSIC</b>

28:57.748 --> 28:59.033
She's flipped.

28:59.477 --> 29:02.122
I think that this film should be,
you know, really beautiful

29:02.167 --> 29:04.052
and glamourous, you know,
like

29:04.108 --> 29:06.913
"Atonement", oh my god,
I love that movie.

29:06.918 --> 29:09.311
No, I did too. But I kinda,

29:09.348 --> 29:11.160
I disagree a little. I,

29:11.206 --> 29:14.070
I think this is a small
delicat film,

29:14.115 --> 29:17.940
and it should be spared
and naturalistic,

29:17.977 --> 29:19.040
like uh,

29:19.088 --> 29:20.312
like "Down to the Bone".

29:20.358 --> 29:23.200
But that girl looked awful
in that movie.

29:23.248 --> 29:24.683
I thought she was good.

29:24.728 --> 29:26.413
I mean, she let herself be awful

29:26.457 --> 29:29.553
because that's what
the character required.

29:29.585 --> 29:30.741
I mean, she was real,

29:30.785 --> 29:33.501
and compelling and,
and riveting.

29:33.535 --> 29:34.621
Oh my god!

29:34.666 --> 29:37.851
I mean, you are so right.
I mean, that's brilliant!

29:37.897 --> 29:40.840
I mean, if you think about it,
if you really wanna win an oscar,

29:40.886 --> 29:43.783
I mean, you've got to play
ugly, retarded or lesbian.

29:43.876 --> 29:45.660
- She's totally right.
- I've totally said that before.

29:45.705 --> 29:46.732
- It's true.
- Totally true.

29:46.757 --> 29:48.510
I've already
played a lesbian, so...

29:48.547 --> 29:50.903
Wait a minute, I'm so sorry.
What are you talking about?

29:50.965 --> 29:52.762
I know, well, you just
do the math. I mean, okay.

29:52.805 --> 29:55.102
Charlize Theron, "Monster".

29:55.137 --> 29:57.690
Ugly, lesbian, oscar.

29:57.727 --> 30:00.291
Nicole Kidman in "The Hours".
Plus that nose?

30:00.336 --> 30:01.221
Really ugly.

30:01.256 --> 30:03.180
Lesbian? Oscar.

30:03.228 --> 30:04.443
Such a good nose too, right?

30:04.495 --> 30:06.893
And Sean Penn in "I am Sam".

30:06.956 --> 30:08.962
Retarded? Oscar note.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.380
And Hilary Swank?

30:10.416 --> 30:11.752
In "Boys don't cry"?

30:11.798 --> 30:13.322
- Total lesbian.
- Right.

30:13.366 --> 30:15.673
I get your point, I really do.

30:16.927 --> 30:20.202
But I don't, I don't think
you have got to be ugly. I just,

30:20.246 --> 30:21.492
you've gotta be real.

30:21.527 --> 30:22.923
Yeah, that's what I mean.
Real.

30:22.957 --> 30:25.170
- You are a genius.
- Dylan, she can't be

30:25.215 --> 30:26.822
real! It's all an act!

30:26.855 --> 30:30.290
I think Dylan's being completely
appropriate. Don't you think?

30:31.787 --> 30:33.690
No, no, don't give her
that much credit yet because

30:33.726 --> 30:35.321
