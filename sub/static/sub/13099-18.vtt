WEBVTT

00:02.750 --> 00:05.833
[instrumental music]

00:10.667 --> 00:12.500
[indistinct radio chatter]

00:13.750 --> 00:15.042
There you go.

00:15.125 --> 00:16.917
- Captain, you got a minute?
- Sure, what's up?

00:17.000 --> 00:19.292
We've got a Markab transport
almost ten hours overdue.

00:19.375 --> 00:21.333
'I've been trying to raise her
but she's not responding.'

00:21.417 --> 00:22.917
So, I'd like to send
a flight of Starfuries

00:23.000 --> 00:25.125
out to her last known position,
see if there's a problem.

00:25.208 --> 00:26.750
Better to be sure, I agree.

00:26.833 --> 00:28.250
Good, I'll send out
Zeta Squadron

00:28.333 --> 00:30.250
as soon as
Lieutenant Keffer gets back.

00:30.333 --> 00:32.208
I thought Zeta Squadron
was on break.

00:32.292 --> 00:34.667
It is, but some time ago
Keffer saw

00:34.750 --> 00:36.917
or thought he saw
something in hyperspace.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.583
'A ship of some kind.
Unknown configuration.'

00:39.667 --> 00:42.542
'So he's been spending some of
his free time looking for it.'

00:44.875 --> 00:47.000
Tell Lieutenant Keffer
to return to base.

00:47.083 --> 00:49.958
I want all freelance expeditions
curbed from now on.

00:50.042 --> 00:53.125
His fighter is to be recharged
and ready to go within the hour.

00:53.208 --> 00:54.792
Yes, sir.

00:57.875 --> 01:01.167
You could have just accepted
my death certificate

01:01.250 --> 01:03.583
and saved yourself the trip.

01:03.667 --> 01:06.167
It's station policy,
all deaths have to be verified

01:06.250 --> 01:07.667
by station personnel

01:07.750 --> 01:10.542
even in cases of death
by natural causes.

01:11.958 --> 01:15.792
No contusions or abrasions.
No sign of trauma.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.875
He had been ill for some time.

01:18.958 --> 01:22.875
His family is quite content
with my diagnosis.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.250
One might only wish
that you would

01:24.333 --> 01:26.250
extend me the same courtesy.

01:26.333 --> 01:30.542
We do have jurisdiction
over our own kind, you know.

01:30.625 --> 01:33.875
Yes, as you have reminded me
three times already.

01:33.958 --> 01:36.292
Look, Lazarenn,
this is not about courtesy

01:36.375 --> 01:37.708
it's not about respect.

01:37.792 --> 01:39.833
N-nobody knows Markab biology
better than you.

01:39.917 --> 01:43.833
A compliment? Ha-ha.
I think I may faint.

01:43.917 --> 01:47.208
Nevertheless, this is the fourth
dead Markab in three days.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.792
All by natural causes.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.125
Now, statistically,
this is way out of proportion.

01:51.208 --> 01:53.583
Stephen, surely you're not
suggesting foul play.

01:53.667 --> 01:57.208
I'm not suggesting anything.
I just want more information.

01:57.292 --> 01:59.000
'Pending any other findings,
I'll formally'

01:59.083 --> 02:00.667
'accept your certificate
of death.'

02:00.750 --> 02:02.667
However, I do reserve the right
to run a few tests

02:02.750 --> 02:04.833
just to be sure.

02:04.917 --> 02:07.208
I'm gonna go wash up,
then arrange for the deceased

02:07.292 --> 02:10.958
to be transferred to Medlab
for a routine autopsy.

02:11.042 --> 02:14.208
Something here doesn't add up,
and unlike Mr. Garibaldi

02:14.292 --> 02:16.083
I don't like mysteries.

02:16.167 --> 02:18.958
[intense music]

02:31.500 --> 02:36.667
(male narrator)
The Babylon Project was our
last, best hope for peace.

02:36.750 --> 02:39.625
A self-contained world,
five miles long

02:39.708 --> 02:42.167
located in neutral territory.

02:45.417 --> 02:47.542
A place of commerce
and diplomacy

02:47.625 --> 02:51.375
for a quarter of a million
humans and aliens.

02:51.458 --> 02:54.292
A shining beacon in space

02:54.375 --> 02:56.625
all alone in the night.

02:56.708 --> 03:00.083
It was the dawn
of the Third Age of mankind.

03:00.167 --> 03:04.500
The year the Great War
came upon us all.

03:04.583 --> 03:08.375
This is the story of the last
of the Babylon stations.

03:08.458 --> 03:10.667
The year is 2259.

03:10.750 --> 03:14.000
The name of the place
is Babylon 5.

03:14.083 --> 03:17.125
[theme music]

03:47.333 --> 03:50.375
[music continues]

04:01.208 --> 04:02.583
There may not be a problem.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.125
But we'd like you to
check it out just in case.

04:04.208 --> 04:05.292
What was her last position?

04:05.375 --> 04:08.167
Sector 23, grid 230, by 9 by 40.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.708
- Cargo?
- Nothing major.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.500
As far as we know.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.167
The Kar'ti
is a civilian transport.

04:13.250 --> 04:15.458
It left the Markab Homeworld
nine days ago.

04:15.542 --> 04:17.333
I've linked her homing beacon
on to your scanners

04:17.417 --> 04:20.458
so you shouldn't have a hard
time finding her, good hunting.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.292
Uh, lieutenant?

04:25.917 --> 04:27.083
Just one more thing.

04:27.167 --> 04:28.542
The captain wants a moratorium

04:28.625 --> 04:30.333
on your little expeditions
into hyperspace.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.917
Come on, commander.
It's on my own time.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.542
That's not the issue.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.625
Things are getting a little
nuts around here right now.

04:35.708 --> 04:37.167
You should know that
better than anyone else.

04:37.250 --> 04:39.000
- There's something out there.
- Yes. There is.

04:39.083 --> 04:40.792
There's something out here.
There's also something in here.

04:40.875 --> 04:42.958
The something in here
is me giving you a direct order.

04:43.042 --> 04:44.333
If there's some part
of that sentence

04:44.417 --> 04:45.833
that you don't understand,
lieutenant

04:45.917 --> 04:47.167
I'll be happy to explain it

04:47.250 --> 04:48.292
to you over
the next four months.

04:48.375 --> 04:49.458
We'll be watching Zeta Squadron

04:49.542 --> 04:51.042
go on missions without you.

04:51.125 --> 04:54.333
Understood.
We'll be back in a few hours.

05:00.542 --> 05:04.167
Well, I have to say,
it looks great.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.958
Thank you, after you
treated me to human-style food

05:07.042 --> 05:09.542
it seemed only fair
to return the favor.

05:09.625 --> 05:13.375
Lennier spent the last two days
preparing the meal.

05:13.458 --> 05:14.542
Two days?

05:14.625 --> 05:17.417
For a meal with
such an honored guest

05:17.500 --> 05:19.208
there are rituals
and traditions.

05:19.292 --> 05:21.125
The food must be
sanctified during

05:21.208 --> 05:23.500
each of the fifteen stages
of cooking.

05:23.583 --> 05:26.250
For instance,
the spices must be blessed

05:26.333 --> 05:29.042
and a specific prayer spoken
when they are used.

05:29.125 --> 05:31.042
Each spice can only be used once

05:31.125 --> 05:33.542
of course, and in
the correct order.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.375
If an error is made, the entire
meal must be abandoned

05:36.458 --> 05:39.167
and we must begin again
from scratch.

05:39.250 --> 05:40.500
So when do you sleep?

05:40.583 --> 05:42.917
One does not sleep
during the cooking.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.417
It could lead to error.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.583
So for two days,
Lennier has not slept.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.125
'In order to remain pure'

05:49.208 --> 05:52.708
he has taken only
water and bread.

05:52.792 --> 05:56.417
Well, I, uh,
I mean, it smells great.

05:56.500 --> 05:58.250
And, uh, I haven't eaten all day

05:58.333 --> 06:00.333
so I'm really looking
forward to this.

06:00.417 --> 06:02.458
Oh, I..

06:02.542 --> 06:04.250
What? What's wrong?

06:04.333 --> 06:06.583
As there are rituals
to follow in preparing

06:06.667 --> 06:08.625
a meal of this nature,
there are other rituals

06:08.708 --> 06:10.875
we must observe
in eating the meal.

06:10.958 --> 06:13.250
Otherwise, the food
is no longer sanctified

06:13.333 --> 06:17.625
and, um, Lennier must begin
all over again.

06:17.708 --> 06:19.417
[chuckles]

06:19.500 --> 06:22.625
Well, we certainly wouldn't
want that, would we?

06:22.708 --> 06:25.458
Um, what do I do?

06:25.542 --> 06:29.792
You hand me your bowl
and I hand you mine

06:29.875 --> 06:31.542
'in a gesture of welcoming.'

06:31.625 --> 06:32.958
Yes.

06:34.625 --> 06:37.625
And-and then, we offer
a portion of our meal

06:37.708 --> 06:39.667
to the one who prepared it

06:39.750 --> 06:42.625
'as a gesture of thankfulness.'

06:43.292 --> 06:44.375
Yeah.

06:46.708 --> 06:48.000
Well, that's..

06:49.458 --> 06:51.917
(Delenn)
'It is then tradition
for the guest'

06:52.000 --> 06:53.958
to set aside one piece of flarn

06:54.042 --> 06:55.875
in the memory of Valen

06:55.958 --> 06:58.500
in the place that is set aside
for his return.

07:00.958 --> 07:04.000
Uh, and the flarn would be..

07:04.083 --> 07:06.833
- The green.
- Oh.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.958
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah.

07:15.417 --> 07:18.167
- Well?
- We may eat now.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.167
Good.

07:20.250 --> 07:21.500
With the right hand.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.750
Hmm.

07:38.833 --> 07:42.417
We must now wait for a few
moments before eating again.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.417
In between,
we meditate upon food.

07:46.792 --> 07:48.042
[inhales]

07:48.125 --> 07:49.750
[exhales]

07:51.625 --> 07:53.083
[inhales]

07:53.167 --> 07:54.375
[exhales]

07:56.000 --> 07:57.167
[inhales]

08:09.083 --> 08:10.208
(male #1)
'There she is.'

08:12.375 --> 08:16.208
This is Starfury Squadron
to Kar'ti, do you receive?

08:16.292 --> 08:18.208
Kar'ti, I repeat,
this is Zeta Squadron

08:18.292 --> 08:21.583
dispatched from Babylon 5
to investigate your situation.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.500
Do you require assistance?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.375
I'm going in for a closer look.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.167
Hang back
till I've checked her out.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.375
(male #2)
'Roger, Zeta One.'

08:31.458 --> 08:33.667
Computer, are we close
enough for a more detailed scan

08:33.750 --> 08:34.667
of the Kar'ti?

08:34.750 --> 08:36.083
[automated]
'Confirmed.'

08:36.167 --> 08:37.750
How many are aboard?

08:37.833 --> 08:39.458
'Registering no life signs'

08:39.542 --> 08:42.083
'aboard the target vessel.'

08:42.167 --> 08:43.417
Check again,
there are supposed to be

08:43.500 --> 08:46.208
over 200 Markabs
on board that thing.

08:46.292 --> 08:50.750
'Confirmed.
Detecting 200 life forms.'

08:50.833 --> 08:52.750
But you said..

08:52.833 --> 08:54.458
Life forms.

08:55.667 --> 08:57.750
But not life signs.

08:57.833 --> 09:00.042
'All 203 of them,
they're all dead?'

09:00.125 --> 09:01.417
[automated]
'Confirmed.'

09:20.292 --> 09:22.125
Medlab 2,
this is Dr. Franklin.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.792
Have the bodies
of those three dead Markabs

09:23.875 --> 09:25.708
been sent back
to their Homeworld yet?

09:25.792 --> 09:28.792
(male #3)
'No, doctor, we just finished
processing the paperwork.'

09:28.875 --> 09:31.167
Good. Get them up here
to Medlab 1, stat.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.708
'Is there a problem?'

09:33.958 --> 09:35.500
I don't know.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.000
Maybe.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.542
(male #1)
Zeta One to Babylon Control.

09:46.625 --> 09:48.500
(female #1)
'This is Babylon Control,
go ahead, Zeta One.'

09:48.583 --> 09:50.333
We're bringing the transport in
for inspection.

09:50.417 --> 09:52.417
Recommend full medical team.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.417
'And you better
let the captain know.'

09:54.500 --> 09:56.417
'I've got an ugly
feeling about this.'

09:59.250 --> 10:01.125
[snoring]

10:01.208 --> 10:03.000
Captain?

10:04.708 --> 10:06.917
Captain Sheridan.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.375
In the memory
of the Nine and the One..

10:10.208 --> 10:11.250
Uh..

10:14.250 --> 10:16.333
- What?
- You were..

10:17.625 --> 10:18.833
You were asleep.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.208
No. No, I wasn't.

10:21.292 --> 10:24.083
I, I-I-I was meditating.

10:24.167 --> 10:27.125
The sound you were making
is part of human meditation?

10:28.292 --> 10:30.375
[chuckles]
I don't snore.

10:32.875 --> 10:34.042
Sheridan, go.

10:34.125 --> 10:36.292
We've got a problem
in Bay 14, captain.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.625
I think you better
get over there.

10:37.708 --> 10:39.375
Will do.

10:39.458 --> 10:42.708
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

10:42.792 --> 10:45.083
The ritual of the meal
was concluded some moments

10:45.167 --> 10:48.625
before you began,
uh, meditating.

10:48.708 --> 10:51.583
Oh. Well, uh, thank you

10:51.667 --> 10:53.583
once again for your invitation.

10:53.667 --> 10:55.833
We must do it again.

10:55.917 --> 10:57.458
Yes. Of-of course.

10:58.875 --> 11:01.125
Yeah. Hmm.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.292
Bye.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.875
[speaking in foreign language]

11:11.542 --> 11:13.125
[sighs]

11:13.208 --> 11:15.833
[indistinct chatter]

11:15.917 --> 11:17.292
What's the problem?

11:17.375 --> 11:21.000
The ship you have commandeered
is Markab property.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.792
I cannot allow
your people inside.

11:23.875 --> 11:27.625
Oh. Well, this ship was found
floating dead in space.

11:27.708 --> 11:30.000
- Now we have to have--
- We have a right to privacy.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.083
You mean, the right
to hide the truth.

11:33.167 --> 11:35.375
What the hell did you think
you were doing?

11:35.458 --> 11:37.458
- Doctor--
- I need some privacy here.

11:37.542 --> 11:39.417
Dr. Franklin. Stephen.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.917
You don't want us
to board that ship

11:41.000 --> 11:43.583
because you suspect
the same thing that I do.

11:43.667 --> 11:44.833
Which is?

11:44.917 --> 11:45.917
(Franklin)
'We've had four dead Markab'

11:46.000 --> 11:47.500
'in the past three days.'

11:47.583 --> 11:50.958
Dr. Lazarenn has certified them
all death by natural causes.

11:51.042 --> 11:52.917
Nothing jumped out about them
in a cursory autopsy

11:53.000 --> 11:54.208
so I let it go.

11:54.292 --> 11:55.875
But I just finished
a more detailed

11:55.958 --> 11:58.125
examination of the bodies.

11:58.208 --> 11:59.333
They were all killed
by some kind of

11:59.417 --> 12:00.708
plague or infectious disease

12:00.792 --> 12:02.375
that was brought onto
the station by your people.

12:02.458 --> 12:05.083
'Now, I want to know how
terminal and how contagious.'

12:06.542 --> 12:08.667
It is 100 percent terminal.

12:10.708 --> 12:13.958
And 100 percent contagious.

12:19.625 --> 12:22.542
[intense music]

12:34.417 --> 12:36.542
(Franklin)
'Damn it, Lazarenn,
what were you thinking?'

12:36.625 --> 12:39.000
Did you really think that
you could keep this a secret?

12:39.083 --> 12:40.792
Well, then,
why didn't you say something?

12:40.875 --> 12:43.083
This plague is spreading
to your people like wild fire.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.417
It is not something
we talk about.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.667
What?

12:48.458 --> 12:49.875
[door closes]

12:52.583 --> 12:55.500
The disease
only appeared once before.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.042
Centuries ago.

12:57.125 --> 13:00.542
'On a small island on our world,
noted for certain excesses.'

13:00.625 --> 13:03.042
'When it was struck down,
the rest of my people believed'

13:03.125 --> 13:07.000
it was a punishment by the Gods
for their lack of morality.

13:07.083 --> 13:08.375
They even named the disease

13:08.458 --> 13:11.833
after the island
devastated by it...Drafa.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.375
Why didn't it spread?

13:13.458 --> 13:16.583
They were isolated
by weather for nearly a year.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.792
And by the time
anybody got out to the island

13:18.875 --> 13:20.500
the disease had wiped out
the population.

13:20.583 --> 13:24.500
'There was no one left alive to
spread it to the new arrivals'

13:24.583 --> 13:28.042
and we assumed that the disease

13:28.125 --> 13:29.875
dead-ended at that point.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.500
Lazarenn, you are a doctor.

13:31.583 --> 13:34.083
You know as well as I do that
diseases they can go dormant

13:34.167 --> 13:35.583
for years or centuries.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.125
They can mutate, they can
come back at you out of nowhere.

13:38.208 --> 13:41.042
Now, why weren't
preparations made?

13:41.125 --> 13:44.625
Over time, it became more
than just a disease. It became..

13:44.708 --> 13:45.708
I don't know, a legend.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.250
A, a specter

13:47.333 --> 13:49.292
used to frighten children
into behaving

13:49.375 --> 13:54.292
"Be good, or the dark angel will
bring you the curse of Drafa."

13:54.375 --> 13:57.708
Only the immoral
would ever be touched by it.

13:57.792 --> 13:59.083
Stephen..

14:01.042 --> 14:05.667
...the first new case of Drafa
was detected nearly a year ago.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.583
'The family was
so scandalized by it'

14:07.667 --> 14:09.417
they lied about what killed him.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.667
By then, several of them
had become infected.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.208
Because they believed
that they were moral

14:14.292 --> 14:16.625
they were sure
they would not be touched.

14:16.708 --> 14:19.750
So they started to go out
amongst the people.

14:19.833 --> 14:22.208
And the disease began to spread.

14:22.292 --> 14:25.417
'Each new infection was
accompanied by silence and fear'

14:25.500 --> 14:27.750
and the assumption
that they were immune.

14:27.833 --> 14:29.417
What about the ship?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.875
Rumors about the new outbreak
of Drafa had gotten out

14:31.958 --> 14:33.708
and some of my people believed
it was a judgment

14:33.792 --> 14:35.417
against our world
and decided to get out

14:35.500 --> 14:36.875
before it was too late.

14:36.958 --> 14:39.250
They have escaped
to all of our colonies

14:39.333 --> 14:42.125
carrying the disease
everywhere, even here.

14:42.208 --> 14:43.708
Look, if you knew
about this a year ago

14:43.792 --> 14:45.292
why didn't you come to me?

14:45.375 --> 14:48.250
Why, why did you try to block
our examination of the ship?

14:48.333 --> 14:51.042
- We could have helped.
- Because I was forbidden!

14:51.125 --> 14:53.917
Because we were ordered
to remain silent.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.042
Our leaders were afraid the
people would take the disease

14:56.125 --> 14:58.500
as a sign from the Gods
that we had fallen from grace.

14:58.583 --> 15:00.958
They were afraid,
they would be voted out

15:01.042 --> 15:02.333
for attacking the public good.

15:02.417 --> 15:03.917
They were afraid.

15:05.042 --> 15:07.875
They were afraid of everything.

15:07.958 --> 15:10.583
Some of us have been
working to find a cure

15:10.667 --> 15:12.625
without enough money
or resources.

15:12.708 --> 15:14.167
They don't even
want to talk about it

15:14.250 --> 15:16.958
as if the very subject
makes them dirty!

15:19.042 --> 15:21.417
Listen, in all the work
you've done

15:21.500 --> 15:23.833
is there any indication
as to whether or not

15:23.917 --> 15:27.667
the disease is infectious
beyond your own species?

15:27.750 --> 15:30.750
I don't know, Stephen.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.792
May the Gods forgive me.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.792
I do not know.

15:38.750 --> 15:41.833
[instrumental music]

16:07.292 --> 16:09.708
Papa, mama sent me to find you.

16:09.792 --> 16:13.125
You are very late for food,
and she is very upset.

16:13.208 --> 16:15.875
She says for you
to come home at once.

16:15.958 --> 16:17.458
Papa?

16:17.542 --> 16:19.000
Papa? Wake up.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.708
[gasps]
Papa!

16:27.792 --> 16:30.250
(Franklin)
'The next 24 hours
are absolutely critical'

16:30.333 --> 16:32.750
if we're going to control
the spread of this disease.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.542
Dr. Lazarenn says
the incubation period

16:34.625 --> 16:36.708
can last several weeks
or just a few days.

16:36.792 --> 16:40.208
Until then,
it's absolutely invisible.

16:40.292 --> 16:43.958
Once symptoms appear, the
patient expires inside 24 hours.

16:44.042 --> 16:46.375
- And there's no cure?
- No, not yet.

16:46.458 --> 16:49.458
Now, the problem is, between
the time the disease shows up

16:49.542 --> 16:51.833
and termination,
you've only got a few hours.

16:51.917 --> 16:54.000
And you can't work up a model
of how a disease works

16:54.083 --> 16:55.792
if you can't follow it
over time.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.583
Do you know how far
this thing has spread?

16:58.667 --> 17:00.250
Until we know otherwise,
we have to assume

17:00.333 --> 17:02.458
the entire Markab community
has been infected.

17:02.542 --> 17:05.375
- What about everybody else?
- That's the big question.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.833
Is the disease contagious
outside their species?

17:07.917 --> 17:10.042
And if so, is it transmitted
through air, touch

17:10.125 --> 17:11.875
bodily fluids
or some other means?

17:11.958 --> 17:13.375
If it's physically transmitted

17:13.458 --> 17:15.292
we might have a chance
at containment.

17:15.375 --> 17:19.292
'If it's airborne, given that
all the air in here is recycled'

17:19.375 --> 17:21.750
'the entire station
might be infected.'

17:29.208 --> 17:32.583
Well, doctor,
it's your jurisdiction.

17:32.667 --> 17:34.042
What's the plan?

17:34.125 --> 17:35.625
I want every Markab
on this station

17:35.708 --> 17:37.792
brought in for a complete
physical examination.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.458
Whoa, whoa, doc,
they'll scream bloody murder

17:39.542 --> 17:41.292
they'll say that we're
implying they're immoral--

17:41.375 --> 17:44.125
We have to know how far
this thing has spread.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.125
And more importantly,
we have to find someone

17:46.208 --> 17:48.375
who is infected before
the disease becomes terminal

17:48.458 --> 17:50.250
so we can follow its progress.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.375
What kind of symptomology
are we looking for?

17:53.458 --> 17:56.625
Chronic dizziness. Acute sore
throat. Low blood pressure.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.375
Swelling of the lymph nodes
and surface glands.

17:58.458 --> 17:59.750
It's all in my report.

17:59.833 --> 18:01.792
Now, once this disease
comes out of dormancy

18:01.875 --> 18:03.625
it heads straight
for the central nervous system

18:03.708 --> 18:05.625
where somehow it,
it starts shutting down

18:05.708 --> 18:09.292
the neural pathways that control
respiration and heartbeat.

18:09.375 --> 18:13.083
Then, inside 24 hours,
paralysis and death.

18:15.083 --> 18:18.292
Commander Ivanova, I'm hereby
issuing an executive order

18:18.375 --> 18:21.167
placing Babylon 5
under quarantine.

18:21.250 --> 18:24.083
Incoming ships
will be diverted elsewhere.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.167
No ships will be
allowed to leave

18:26.250 --> 18:28.417
until we determine
just how far this disease

18:28.500 --> 18:29.750
is likely to spread.

18:29.833 --> 18:32.625
Are we gonna tell people
why they can't leave?

18:32.708 --> 18:35.042
I don't think we have a choice.

18:35.125 --> 18:36.708
What about segregating
the Markabs

18:36.792 --> 18:38.542
from the rest
of the general population?

18:38.625 --> 18:40.750
No, no, no, no,
if the disease is airborne

18:40.833 --> 18:42.542
then moving them into
a different part of the station

18:42.625 --> 18:43.750
is not going to solve
the problem.

18:43.833 --> 18:45.333
All the air is recycled.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.667
If it turns out that the disease
is not transmissible

18:47.750 --> 18:50.000
to other species
then confining them to one area

18:50.083 --> 18:51.750
will only speed-up
the infection

18:51.833 --> 18:53.875
among the Markab community
without good reason.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.625
On the other hand,
when word gets out

18:55.708 --> 18:56.958
that we've got
the next best thing

18:57.042 --> 18:58.333
to the Black Death
roaming on the station

18:58.417 --> 18:59.958
it's gonna scare everybody.

19:00.042 --> 19:02.208
When people get scared they
start looking for scapegoats.

19:02.292 --> 19:04.292
If we can keep the Markabs
all together in one place

19:04.375 --> 19:06.042
my people can protect them.

19:06.125 --> 19:09.375
Because, trust me, this is gonna
get real ugly, real fast.

19:09.458 --> 19:12.958
No, there are still too many
variables, too many unknowns.

19:13.042 --> 19:16.750
I need answers, doctor, and as
fast as you can get them to me.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.042
That's all.

19:20.292 --> 19:22.375
You better cancel all leaves
for security personnel.

19:22.458 --> 19:23.625
I've got a hunch
you're gonna need them.

19:23.708 --> 19:25.042
Yes, sir.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.667
(male announcer)
Repeating our announcement

19:26.750 --> 19:29.500
no ship will be allowed
to depart Babylon 5

19:29.583 --> 19:31.833
until further notice.

19:31.917 --> 19:33.417
Please address all questions

19:33.500 --> 19:36.917
to the appropriate
station personnel.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.792
Please return to your quarters
until the quarantine is lifted.

19:43.917 --> 19:47.042
It's just for some tests,
that's all. This way, please.

19:50.833 --> 19:52.625
[indistinct chatter]

19:54.083 --> 19:55.250
[beeping]

19:56.958 --> 19:58.250
(female #2)
'Next.'

20:00.708 --> 20:02.375
[beeping]

20:07.042 --> 20:10.750
Alright, that'll do it.
Thank you.

20:10.833 --> 20:12.417
Next, please.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.625
We've got another one.

20:23.708 --> 20:26.833
Captain Sheridan,
this is an outrage.

20:26.917 --> 20:29.750
I will not have my people
treated in this fashion.

20:29.833 --> 20:31.958
- Poked, prodded, accused--
- Ambassador Fashar--

20:32.042 --> 20:35.167
You are spreading hysteria
and fear about my people

20:35.250 --> 20:37.042
that is totally unwarranted.

20:37.125 --> 20:39.083
On top of that,
you're disgracing

20:39.167 --> 20:41.458
good and decent people
by implying

20:41.542 --> 20:43.292
they're unclean, immoral--

20:43.375 --> 20:44.833
No one said
anything of the kind.

20:44.917 --> 20:46.958
(Fashar)
'That is the absolute
implication.'

20:47.042 --> 20:49.958
How do I know
this isn't a conspiracy

20:50.042 --> 20:53.167
on the part of your world
to destroy my people?

20:53.250 --> 20:55.833
'For all I know,
this disease was planted'

20:55.917 --> 20:57.708
in our drinking water,
our food.

20:57.792 --> 21:00.250
None of this happened
until we began coming here.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.750
Perhaps, it is your
own immorality

21:02.833 --> 21:05.042
that has contaminated us.

21:05.125 --> 21:09.833
So we will fix this by removing
ourselves from your immorality.

21:09.917 --> 21:11.750
- Captain.
- Just a minute, doctor.

21:11.833 --> 21:14.625
- This can't wait.
- You can't leave the station.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.125
We are gathering together
in an isolation zone

21:17.208 --> 21:19.625
'away from others,
away from outsiders.'

21:19.708 --> 21:22.375
We will stay,
and pray, and repent.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.708
And when we come out,
we alone will survive.

21:25.792 --> 21:28.125
If you do that, you'll just
end up spreading the disease

21:28.208 --> 21:29.958
among your own people
that much faster.

21:30.042 --> 21:34.000
I refuse to listen to this.
You have been warned.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.208
Stay away from us.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.542
(Garibaldi)
'Well, looks like they
just made the decision'

21:39.625 --> 21:40.958
about quarantine for you.

21:41.042 --> 21:42.583
Yeah, for all the wrong reasons.
What is it, doctor?

21:42.667 --> 21:45.292
You better get down to Brown 17,
captain. You too, Garibaldi.

21:45.375 --> 21:46.542
What's up?

21:46.625 --> 21:48.833
First, our tests confirm
the disease is airborne.

21:48.917 --> 21:51.042
We have to assume
it's all over the station.

21:51.125 --> 21:54.250
Second, I found a dead
Pak'ma'ra. No signs of violence.

21:54.333 --> 21:55.583
Is it the plague?

21:55.667 --> 21:57.708
Won't know
until we do an autopsy.

21:57.792 --> 21:59.708
But I wanted to warn you

21:59.792 --> 22:02.542
the disease may be spreading
into the general population.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.250
Yes. Yes, inside. Hurry.

22:08.333 --> 22:11.125
It's for the best, trust me.

22:11.208 --> 22:13.292
We are the pure.

22:13.375 --> 22:16.917
If we believe,
then the Dark Angel of Drafa

22:17.000 --> 22:18.917
will pass over us.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.750
'Hurry, inside now.
Everyone inside!'

22:21.833 --> 22:23.875
[indistinct chatter]

22:35.042 --> 22:36.542
(Franklin)
'We need to start
a full autopsy'

22:36.625 --> 22:38.917
before the body goes
further into rigor mortis.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.750
We're instituting
full biohazard routines

22:40.833 --> 22:43.792
but I'll still
need you to go in and..

22:43.875 --> 22:45.542
What? What is it?

22:52.042 --> 22:53.542
Alright, fine.

22:53.625 --> 22:55.542
I'll go in, you stay out here
and monitor the readouts.

22:55.625 --> 22:56.792
(Lazarenn)
'I have a better idea.'

22:58.583 --> 23:00.292
I have the most experience
with the disease.

23:00.375 --> 23:04.125
I will go into the Isolab
and perform the autopsy.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.333
Doctor Lazarenn, if you--

23:05.417 --> 23:07.000
'And once finished'

23:07.083 --> 23:08.875
I will stay inside.

23:10.417 --> 23:12.125
The Isolab
is hermetically sealed.

23:12.208 --> 23:15.542
If I am contaminated it will
not get through the air lock.

23:17.667 --> 23:20.500
It will give me a chance
to do some good, Stephen.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.833
Give me that much.

23:32.875 --> 23:34.250
[door opens]

23:42.125 --> 23:43.667
Alright.

23:43.750 --> 23:46.667
Let's get to work, shall we?

23:46.750 --> 23:48.500
(Ivanova)
'And we've had three more
incidents of violence'

23:48.583 --> 23:50.292
'against Markabs
in the past two hours.'

23:50.375 --> 23:52.250
'It's getting ugly
out there, captain.'

23:52.333 --> 23:53.792
Some of the more extreme
human and alien groups

23:53.875 --> 23:55.917
say that they've found
a solution to the problem.

23:56.000 --> 23:58.583
Wipe out the Markabs,
you wipe out the problem.

23:58.667 --> 24:01.000
Seems we've heard that before.

24:01.083 --> 24:02.708
How's their quarantine going?

24:02.792 --> 24:04.333
Four thousand
out of the estimated

24:04.417 --> 24:05.667
five thousand resident Markabs

24:05.750 --> 24:07.583
have entered the isolation zone.

24:07.667 --> 24:09.208
'The rest of them
either haven't been found yet'

24:09.292 --> 24:10.542
'or they're hiding,
afraid to take the trip'

24:10.625 --> 24:11.875
which of course
puts them in danger

24:11.958 --> 24:13.417
if they're
found by the others.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.542
Hmm. Tell Garibaldi
to take some of his people

24:15.625 --> 24:17.833
off the search teams
and put them on patrol.

24:17.917 --> 24:20.250
Any violence is to be
stopped immediately.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.542
Will do.
Try to get some sleep, captain.

24:22.625 --> 24:24.833
I'll take first watch and have
someone wake you in four hours.

24:24.917 --> 24:26.375
- Hmm.
- C &amp; C out.

24:27.708 --> 24:29.333
[doorbell beeps]

24:29.417 --> 24:30.958
(John)
'Yeah, come in.'

24:32.417 --> 24:35.250
Captain, I'm sorry
to disturb you at this time.

24:35.333 --> 24:38.125
No, no, no.
No, no. It's-it's alright.

24:38.208 --> 24:41.167
I doubt I'd be
able to sleep anyway.

24:41.250 --> 24:42.542
Yeah, what can I do for you?

24:42.625 --> 24:44.125
I have been monitoring
the situation

24:44.208 --> 24:46.625
and, uh, I would
like to make a request.

24:48.167 --> 24:50.208
Ambassador, we can't let
anyone off this station--

24:50.292 --> 24:53.875
I would like to be allowed
into the isolation zone.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.958
I've spoken
with Ambassador Fashar

24:56.042 --> 24:58.625
and he's willing to
allow us entry.

24:58.708 --> 24:59.792
Why?

25:01.458 --> 25:03.292
They're in pain.

25:03.375 --> 25:06.250
Frightened. Dying.

25:06.333 --> 25:08.250
Minbari are taught
that at such a time

25:08.333 --> 25:10.417
the afflicted should be
ministered to, comforted.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.083
They're not your own people,
Delenn.

25:12.167 --> 25:14.375
I didn't know
that similarity was required

25:14.458 --> 25:16.958
for the exercise of compassion.

25:17.042 --> 25:18.792
They are afraid.

25:18.875 --> 25:20.750
We wish to do
what little we can.

25:22.000 --> 25:23.125
We?

25:23.208 --> 25:24.917
Lennier has asked to
accompany me.

25:25.000 --> 25:28.042
- Delenn, I cannot allow this--
- I understand the risk.

25:28.125 --> 25:29.625
Captain.

25:29.708 --> 25:32.250
If the disease is limited
only to the Markab

25:32.333 --> 25:33.958
we should do all we can.

25:34.042 --> 25:37.208
But if it's not,
then we must give comfort

25:37.292 --> 25:40.042
because very soon,
we will require it ourselves.

25:40.125 --> 25:44.792
You will be exposing yourself
to massive contamination.

25:44.875 --> 25:47.792
If I let you into
that isolation zone..

25:47.875 --> 25:49.917
...I can't let you out again.

25:52.875 --> 25:54.208
I know.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.250
Alright.

26:04.083 --> 26:06.375
I'll tell security
to let you through.

26:06.458 --> 26:07.750
'Thank you.'

26:09.208 --> 26:11.292
'Don't look away, captain.'

26:13.000 --> 26:14.708
'All life is transitory.'

26:15.750 --> 26:17.625
A dream.

26:17.708 --> 26:21.625
We all come together in the same
place at the end of time.

26:23.542 --> 26:26.000
If I don't see you again here..

26:28.125 --> 26:30.208
'...I will see you
in a little while'

26:31.667 --> 26:33.958
in the place
where no shadows fall.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.042
'Well, Delenn..'

26:45.083 --> 26:47.083
When I do see you again..

26:51.083 --> 26:52.917
...call me John.

27:03.833 --> 27:06.875
It's all your fault!
What did you do, huh?

27:07.000 --> 27:08.542
Why did you bring this here?

27:08.625 --> 27:10.500
You messed me up!
You messed us all up!

27:10.583 --> 27:12.000
Hey, leave him alone!

27:12.083 --> 27:14.375
[grunting]

27:14.458 --> 27:16.292
- Don't.
- What, are you on his side, uh?

27:16.375 --> 27:18.542
Shut up! Come on, get out.

27:18.625 --> 27:20.542
Let's go! Move it!

27:20.625 --> 27:21.708
Get out of here
and maybe I'll let you leave

27:21.792 --> 27:23.500
with your ribs intact.

27:23.583 --> 27:26.167
Big threat,
we're all gonna die anyway.

27:26.250 --> 27:27.500
[groaning]

27:35.958 --> 27:39.000
[instrumental music]

27:59.458 --> 28:01.875
[indistinct chatter]

28:01.958 --> 28:03.667
[door closes]

28:05.875 --> 28:08.917
[intense music]

28:36.917 --> 28:38.125
[hissing]

28:40.625 --> 28:42.708
You should get some sleep.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.667
Can't. Too much to do.

28:46.750 --> 28:49.125
That's your third stim tonight.

28:49.208 --> 28:50.875
Too much isn't good for you.

28:52.250 --> 28:53.500
If we don't figure this out

28:53.583 --> 28:56.333
it's really not gonna matter,
now is it?

28:56.417 --> 28:59.083
Any more news
on the Pak'ma'ra tests?

28:59.167 --> 29:00.625
No.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.458
Security reports
finding the bodies

29:02.542 --> 29:04.417
of a dozen of your people.

29:06.167 --> 29:08.250
The plague is spreading fast.

29:08.333 --> 29:09.708
And the violence?

29:09.792 --> 29:12.000
So far they've got it
under control.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.625
And everyone's looking
for someone to blame.

29:14.708 --> 29:16.167
'Same old story.'

29:16.250 --> 29:18.917
Black Death, AIDS,
Chalmers Syndrome.

29:19.000 --> 29:21.167
Millions die
and no one remembers

29:21.250 --> 29:22.333
the lessons we've learned.

29:22.417 --> 29:24.833
What was this, uh, Black Death?

29:24.917 --> 29:27.667
'Well, it hit Earth around
the middle of the 14th Century.'

29:27.750 --> 29:29.500
Before it was finished,
it wiped out three quarters

29:29.583 --> 29:31.667
of the European population.

29:31.750 --> 29:33.875
They said the same things too.

29:33.958 --> 29:36.958
It was punishment from God
for our immorality.

29:37.042 --> 29:39.917
'Some blamed the Jews and the
lepers for poisoning the wells'

29:40.000 --> 29:44.167
and others said the plague
was sent by the devil.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.583
And since cats were supposed
to be the devil's familiars

29:47.667 --> 29:49.250
they were killed
by the millions.

29:49.333 --> 29:52.750
But cats were the only means
of controlling the real source

29:52.833 --> 29:56.000
of the plague, the rats and
the fleas that went with them.

29:56.083 --> 29:58.667
So all they were doing
was helping the plague

29:58.750 --> 30:00.208
spread even faster.

30:00.292 --> 30:02.542
But that does seem to be
the rule, doesn't it?

30:02.625 --> 30:05.458
Analyze the problem,
choose whichever strategy

30:05.542 --> 30:08.000
makes least sense
and then do it.

30:09.750 --> 30:12.042
- Lazarenn?
- I'm diz-dizzy.

30:13.167 --> 30:14.208
Ah!

30:15.542 --> 30:18.542
Well, that seems to..

30:18.625 --> 30:20.208
...confirm it.

30:20.292 --> 30:23.375
'I-I felt my throat
sore a few minutes ago.'

30:23.458 --> 30:24.792
Stephen, you wanted to examine

30:24.875 --> 30:28.500
someone in the early stages
of the infection.

30:28.583 --> 30:31.375
I think you should run
some tests.

30:32.458 --> 30:33.875
'Quickly.'

30:44.042 --> 30:46.875
[intense music]

31:15.583 --> 31:19.375
- Are you alright?
- I can't find my mama.

31:19.458 --> 31:22.000
Then we will find her for you.

31:22.083 --> 31:24.958
Lennier. Lennier!

31:25.042 --> 31:26.417
Yes, Delenn.

31:29.417 --> 31:31.542
She has separated
from her mother.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.542
Please find her.

31:37.375 --> 31:38.500
How?

31:39.875 --> 31:41.417
Faith manages.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.292
What is her name?

31:45.375 --> 31:46.792
Mama.

31:49.708 --> 31:51.833
Faith manages.

32:01.083 --> 32:03.708
There's a definite increase
in respiration of A cells.

32:03.792 --> 32:05.083
Yellow blood cell count?

32:05.167 --> 32:06.542
Five hundred per thousand
and dropping.

32:06.625 --> 32:07.667
Neural transmission efficiency?

32:07.750 --> 32:08.875
Down 15 percent.

32:08.958 --> 32:10.500
Alright, cross reference
the two and see

32:10.583 --> 32:12.208
if they're dropping at the same
rate, maybe the drop

32:12.292 --> 32:14.000
in the cells is causing the
neural pathways to degrade.

32:14.083 --> 32:16.500
- Give me ten minutes.
- No, you've got five minutes.

32:16.583 --> 32:20.083
(Lazarenn)
'There's a strange
tingling in my fingers..'

32:20.167 --> 32:21.500
[chuckles]

32:21.583 --> 32:25.042
...and an odd sense
of euphoria.

32:25.125 --> 32:26.833
Check the brain stim
for any unusual activity.

32:26.917 --> 32:27.833
Yes, sir.

32:27.917 --> 32:29.542
Stephen,
I was trying to remember

32:29.625 --> 32:31.708
how we first met.

32:31.792 --> 32:35.708
It seems like ages ago.

32:35.792 --> 32:41.542
Oh, yes. It was back home
and you were on layover.

32:41.625 --> 32:44.000
You were hitchhiking

32:44.083 --> 32:46.417
on starships then.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.042
You were very funny.

32:48.125 --> 32:50.833
'Everything to you
is a problem to be solved'

32:50.917 --> 32:53.208
'a test to be passed.'

32:53.292 --> 32:54.625
But you know, Stephen

32:54.708 --> 32:57.208
sometimes the test
is not to find the answer

32:57.292 --> 33:00.083
it's to see how you react

33:00.167 --> 33:05.250
when you realize
there is no answer.

33:05.333 --> 33:09.958
Doctor. We just got the results
of the Pak'ma'ra autopsy.

33:10.042 --> 33:12.208
It's the plague.
It jumped species.

33:20.958 --> 33:24.333
Alright, Mitch, Tasabe,
you take Simms down to Medlab 2.

33:24.417 --> 33:26.458
You take apart
that Pak'ma'ra inch by inch.

33:26.542 --> 33:28.167
There's got to be
a reason why they fell sick

33:28.250 --> 33:29.792
before the humans
or the varns or anybody else.

33:29.875 --> 33:32.417
Now, that similarity maybe what
we need to crack this thing.

33:32.500 --> 33:33.500
Now, go. Move.

33:33.583 --> 33:34.917
But don't you understand
what this means?

33:35.000 --> 33:36.417
It means,
we have more information

33:36.500 --> 33:38.292
than we had five minutes ago.

33:38.375 --> 33:39.500
And if we're gonna
beat this thing

33:39.583 --> 33:40.917
we need all the information
we can get.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.417
Now, I want a complete

33:42.500 --> 33:44.583
biogenic comparison
of these two groups in an hour

33:44.667 --> 33:46.417
or by God, you're gonna have
something the hell of a lot

33:46.500 --> 33:47.917
worse than the plague
to worry about.

33:48.000 --> 33:50.250
Now, move! I want answers!

33:53.208 --> 33:55.542
Has he found mama yet?

33:55.625 --> 33:57.833
No, not yet.

33:57.917 --> 34:00.500
But he will.
Don't be afraid.

34:00.583 --> 34:02.792
I can't help it.
I'm sorry.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.958
No, don't be sorry.
It happens to us all.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.917
When I was a child

34:09.000 --> 34:11.250
I once visited the city
with my family

34:11.333 --> 34:14.917
and became separated
from my parents.

34:15.000 --> 34:16.958
The more I looked for them

34:17.042 --> 34:19.667
the more lost I became.

34:19.750 --> 34:23.875
The streets became smaller,
narrower, darker.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.000
I was so afraid.

34:28.417 --> 34:32.542
Then I found myself
in an old temple

34:32.625 --> 34:37.500
and I thought,
I will wait here.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.833
I will be safe here,
and they will come.

34:40.917 --> 34:42.458
They will come for me.

34:42.542 --> 34:43.917
Did they?

34:44.000 --> 34:46.125
Not at first.

34:46.208 --> 34:48.375
Hours passed.

34:48.458 --> 34:51.750
The temple was cold
and deserted.

34:51.833 --> 34:54.667
I fell asleep.

34:54.750 --> 34:59.333
When I woke up, there was
someone standing over me.

34:59.417 --> 35:01.000
He looked down and smiled

35:01.083 --> 35:05.417
and...my fear went away.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.667
He stood there,
bright against the darkness

35:08.750 --> 35:11.833
and said that I was
going to be alright.

35:11.917 --> 35:15.208
That if I believed

35:15.292 --> 35:17.875
then my parents
will come for me.

35:17.958 --> 35:23.000
He said, "I will not allow harm
to come to my little ones here

35:23.083 --> 35:26.083
in my great house."

35:26.167 --> 35:29.958
Just then, the door opened

35:30.042 --> 35:32.875
and my parents came running in.

35:32.958 --> 35:34.375
[sighs]
Sh'naal?

35:34.458 --> 35:35.917
Mama!

35:40.875 --> 35:42.375
I was worried about you.

Save your strength, Lazarenn.

36:30.333 --> 36:33.792
The yellow cells could be..

36:36.125 --> 36:38.833
- Could be what?
- Could be..

36:38.917 --> 36:42.000
- What?
- 'I'm sorry, old friend.'

36:42.083 --> 36:45.250
I, I don't think
I can stay any longer.

36:47.750 --> 36:49.375

37:38.375 --> 37:40.417
'Match found.'

37:44.708 --> 37:46.333
Show me.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.917
The brain gives orders to
the body through a complex chain

37:53.000 --> 37:54.792
of electrochemical relays.

37:54.875 --> 37:57.000
An electrical impulse
runs the length of a neuron

37:57.083 --> 37:59.500
and stops at a break
called the synaptic gap.

37:59.583 --> 38:01.958
The electrical impulse is
translated into biochemical form

38:02.042 --> 38:03.333
which jumps across the gap

38:03.417 --> 38:04.833
to the next neuron
over and over again

38:04.917 --> 38:07.083
until the information
reaches its destination.

38:07.167 --> 38:10.625
Now, I assumed that the disease
was attacking the nerve itself.

38:10.708 --> 38:12.500
But there was never any damage.

38:12.583 --> 38:14.542
What it was actually doing

38:14.625 --> 38:18.458
was neutralizing the chemicals
in the synaptic gap.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.500
In other words

38:22.583 --> 38:25.125
an order comes
from the brain to the gap

38:25.208 --> 38:26.417
but the chemicals
that are supposed to

38:26.500 --> 38:27.708
relay the information

38:27.792 --> 38:30.042
to the next neuron
don't work anymore.

38:30.125 --> 38:33.208
Exactly.
The heart's not ordered to pump.

38:33.292 --> 38:36.375
The lungs
aren't ordered to breathe..

38:36.458 --> 38:37.875
...the body dies.

38:37.958 --> 38:39.750
Have you developed a profile
of who's most prone

38:39.833 --> 38:41.417
to being infected?

38:41.500 --> 38:43.625
The risk is confined
races

38:43.708 --> 38:44.958
that use specialized cells

38:45.042 --> 38:47.833
to manufacture the chemicals
used in neural relays.

38:47.917 --> 38:50.958
'In Markabs, the chemical is
produced by the yellow cells.'

38:51.042 --> 38:52.375
'In the Pak'ma'ra,
it's the green cells.'

38:52.458 --> 38:54.708
Now, those are the ones
targeted by the disease.

38:54.792 --> 38:57.417
Now, fortunately, our bodies
don't work that way.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.250
But given the chance,
the disease could mutate

38:59.333 --> 39:02.208
into something that could affect
us all, if we don't stop it now.

39:02.292 --> 39:03.917
So, what do we do?

39:04.000 --> 39:05.417
Well, we can't
destroy the disease

39:05.500 --> 39:07.375
but we can
artificially stimulate

39:07.458 --> 39:08.833
yellow and green cell production

39:08.917 --> 39:10.375
with a series
of regular injections.

39:10.458 --> 39:14.083
Now, those who receive
the injections, over time

39:14.167 --> 39:15.500
will produce stronger cells

39:15.583 --> 39:18.417
that are capable of
withstanding the disease.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.125
All my data shows
it should work.

39:20.208 --> 39:23.542
Should?
You haven't tested it yet?

39:23.625 --> 39:25.583
No.

39:25.667 --> 39:27.667
There wasn't time.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.667
I've prepared enough
for 500 doses to start

39:29.750 --> 39:31.667
but we will have to hurry.

39:43.458 --> 39:45.875
- Any reply to our message yet?
- No, sir.

39:47.792 --> 39:49.375
Open it up.

Anyone at all?

41:14.792 --> 41:17.375
You are to be congratulated
for finding a way

41:17.458 --> 41:19.875
to stop the plague
from spreading further.

41:19.958 --> 41:22.000
Well, any thanks
is more properly directed

41:22.083 --> 41:24.042
to Dr. Franklin.

41:24.125 --> 41:27.583
We dodged the bullet this time.

41:27.667 --> 41:30.542
- What happens next time?
- What happens?

41:32.167 --> 41:34.667
What happens is that we honor
the memory of those

41:34.750 --> 41:37.125
who are no longer with us

41:37.208 --> 41:40.083
by using what we have learned
to save others.

41:40.167 --> 41:44.583
To exercise faith
and patience and charity.

41:44.667 --> 41:47.583
To reach out to those
who are afraid.

41:47.667 --> 41:52.042
If we can do that, then their
passing will have had meaning

41:52.125 --> 41:53.958
and we will grow from it.

41:54.042 --> 41:55.167
Yeah, maybe.

41:57.208 --> 41:58.375
I hope so.

41:59.750 --> 42:02.417
Medical ships dispatched
to the Markab Homeworld

42:02.500 --> 42:04.125
have confirmed the death toll.

42:04.208 --> 42:06.292
The entire planetary population

42:06.375 --> 42:08.625
has been wiped out
by the plague.

42:08.708 --> 42:10.000
Over two billion dead

42:10.083 --> 42:12.042
in addition to another
two or three million

42:12.125 --> 42:14.250
on other colonies and outposts.

42:14.333 --> 42:16.375
Although it is expected
that some Markabs

42:16.458 --> 42:19.083
may have survived
on isolated colonies

42:19.167 --> 42:20.708
for all intents and purposes

42:20.792 --> 42:24.000
the Markab civilization
has been destroyed.

of widespread destruction'
