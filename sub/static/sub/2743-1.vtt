He was practically white.

Didn't say anything
about a bill to me.
He was very polite.

10:49.753 --> 10:52.654
Gave me the order and said,
looked like things
were picking up.

He thought you were my maid.
Now he thinks I'm prosperous.

10:56.727 --> 11:00.663
No sin in lookin' prosperous.
Just a way of showin'

in the mail.

13:16.366 --> 13:19.529
It would be so much
more convenient...
Checks are mailed on Thursday.

13:19.603 --> 13:22.003
We don't want to confuse
the bookkeeper.

13:22.072 --> 13:24.131
Don't forget to leave
the wardrobe.

13:29.012 --> 13:31.344
[Imitating Snarl]
[Barks]

13:33.817 --> 13:36.479
But wouldn't you like
to have a bite to eat?

13:36.553 --> 13:38.521
Later. Thanks.

13:45.796 --> 13:49.323
You can keep the money
from this batch, Annie.

13:49.399 --> 13:51.799
It'll pay you for staying
today and cooking and...

13:51.869 --> 13:54.337
Uh-uh. That money
goes into our kitty.

13:56.073 --> 13:59.099
"Our"?

13:59.176 --> 14:01.144
Seems as if
you intend to stay.

14:01.211 --> 14:05.511
Seems like I do,
if, if you want it.

14:07.618 --> 14:11.987
You know I do.
But you can see
how bad things are.

14:12.055 --> 14:17.186
Miss Lora, we just come
from a place where,

14:17.261 --> 14:21.357
where my color
deviled my baby.

14:21.431 --> 14:23.899
Now, anything happens here
has gotta be better.

14:23.967 --> 14:27.664
Oh, Annie.
Oh.

14:34.311 --> 14:38.111
Susie? Susie?
I'm home...

14:38.182 --> 14:41.549
Oh, baby.
Mmm. Hi, dear.

14:41.618 --> 14:43.552
Hello, Miss Lora.
Hello, Annie.

14:43.620 --> 14:47.716
Mommy, we had such fun today.
Annie took us to the park
and we caught a squirrel.

14:47.791 --> 14:51.488
No, we didn't.
Well, we nearly did.

14:51.562 --> 14:55.999
Tomorrow I'll take you
both to the park and
we'll really catch one.

14:56.066 --> 14:59.331
How'd it go?
Oh, Annie.

15:00.404 --> 15:02.338
It didn't.

15:04.775 --> 15:06.902
And I'm exhausted.

15:06.977 --> 15:10.310
Walked my feet off
trying to see every
agent on Broadway.

15:10.380 --> 15:13.213
And some off Broadway.
Way off.

15:13.283 --> 15:15.751
<i>[Buzzer Buzzing]</i>
I'll get it.

15:15.819 --> 15:18.083
The children have eaten.

15:19.156 --> 15:21.716
Yes?
Hello, this is
Steve Archer.

15:21.792 --> 15:24.124
- Steve Archer?
- I brought the pictures.

15:24.194 --> 15:27.789
You brought the pictures?
The ones of the children
on the beach.

15:27.865 --> 15:31.062
Oh, the man on the beach.
<i>[Sarah Jane]</i>
<i>The man on the beach? </i>

15:31.134 --> 15:33.432
The man on the beach!
It's our picture
with the fat man!

15:33.503 --> 15:36.336
<i>Mommy, tell him</i>
<i>to come up. </i>
<i>Yes, please! </i>

15:36.406 --> 15:41.139
Oh, all right. Will
you come up, Mr. Archer?
<i>[Girls Squealing]</i>

15:41.211 --> 15:45.807
<i>[Girls Laughing]</i>

15:45.883 --> 15:50.479
Come on. Let's see.
Did you bring the pictures?
Hi, Susie, Sarah Jane.

15:50.554 --> 15:52.579
Where is it?
Aren't you kids
supposed to be in bed?

15:52.656 --> 15:54.624
No, we waited for you!

15:54.691 --> 15:57.319
[Chuckling]
Hello.
Good evening.

15:57.394 --> 16:01.626
[Squealing, Laughing]

16:01.698 --> 16:05.031
[Laughing]

16:05.102 --> 16:08.435
If it's that funny,
let me see it.

16:13.644 --> 16:17.045
[Laughing]
Don't you think
it's funny, Annie?

16:17.114 --> 16:20.709
<i>[Lora]</i>
<i>I don't know who's funnier, </i>
<i>you or that man. </i>

16:20.784 --> 16:25.346
All I got to say is,
it's lucky I didn't catch
Sarah Jane playing such pranks.

16:25.422 --> 16:28.983
It just ain't
seemly, Miss Lora.
Now, off to bed.

16:29.059 --> 16:31.027
Good night.
Good night.

16:31.094 --> 16:33.358
Good night, Mr. Archer.
Good night, ladies.

16:33.430 --> 16:36.456
Good night.
Won't you sit down?

16:36.533 --> 16:39.502
It was very nice of you
to remember the children.

16:39.569 --> 16:44.006
I like what you did...
for Sarah Jane and Annie.

16:44.074 --> 16:48.738
Well, they didn't have a place
and since I live here alone...

16:48.812 --> 16:53.647
I'm a widow.
Oh, you... are.

16:56.553 --> 16:59.852
What do you think of this?

16:59.923 --> 17:02.050
<i>[Steve]</i>
<i>Mother in distress. </i>

17:02.125 --> 17:05.617
Well, that's good.
Very good.

17:08.432 --> 17:12.528
Who are you anyway?
Well, you don't look
like a photographer.

17:12.602 --> 17:14.934
Apparently the army
thought I did.

17:15.005 --> 17:16.996
Anyhow, they made me one.

17:17.074 --> 17:20.942
Now all I wanna do is
get pictures like this
in The Museum of Modern Art.

17:21.011 --> 17:23.343
Oh, you're aiming high.

17:23.413 --> 17:25.711
Why not?
It doesn't cost anymore.

17:25.781 --> 17:29.013
Don't you believe
in chasing rainbows?

17:29.086 --> 17:34.718
Well, if I didn't,
I wouldn't be here.
I'm an actress.

17:37.627 --> 17:41.620
What's the matter?
Your bones.

17:41.698 --> 17:44.428
What about my bones?

17:44.501 --> 17:46.935
They're perfect.

17:47.004 --> 17:51.270
My camera could easily
have a love affair with you.

17:53.176 --> 17:56.441
Don't you think it's
getting a little late?

17:58.348 --> 18:01.647
I don't suppose you'd like
to have dinner with me.

18:01.718 --> 18:04.380
Maybe. Sometime.

18:04.454 --> 18:07.787
I don't mean right away.
How about tomorrow?

18:07.858 --> 18:12.989
I'm sorry, but I don't like
to miss having dinner with the
children two nights in a row.

18:13.063 --> 18:16.328
I can understand that.
How about lunch?

18:17.734 --> 18:19.793
Lunch?

18:19.870 --> 18:22.668
Would you mind taking me
to Rodney's?

18:22.739 --> 18:25.572
It's a little place
on 45th and 8th.

18:25.642 --> 18:27.610
Unemployed actors
can afford it.

18:27.677 --> 18:30.271
Sort of a poor man's 21.

18:30.347 --> 18:33.805
All right, I'll meet you
there at noon.

18:36.219 --> 18:39.211
Oh, by the way,
the name's Steve.

18:42.626 --> 18:44.890
Everybody in here an actor?
Just about.

18:44.961 --> 18:47.623
So far you're the only one
I really believe.

18:47.697 --> 18:52.259
Thank you. Only so far,
you're the only one
in New York who does.

18:52.335 --> 18:55.327
But someday I'm going to
make them all feel that way.

18:55.405 --> 18:59.933
Aren't you a little late
getting started?
I mean, it's...

19:00.010 --> 19:04.208
Yes, five years late.
That's why every day counts.

19:04.281 --> 19:08.843
Why the five-year lapse?
My husband was
in the theater too.

19:08.919 --> 19:12.150
A director.
A good director.

19:12.222 --> 19:14.850
Everything I know
I owe to him.

19:14.925 --> 19:18.827
It was a small town,
a little theater,
but professional.

19:18.895 --> 19:23.195
When he died,
I had to make a living
doing something else.

19:23.266 --> 19:26.258
I never really wanted
anything but the stage.

19:26.336 --> 19:28.395
Oh, except Susie.

19:28.472 --> 19:31.839
So, it took me five years
to save enough money
to come to New York.

19:31.908 --> 19:33.967
But you did it.
Mm-hmm.

19:34.044 --> 19:37.070
And I'm going to be an
actress, an important one...
<i>[Woman] Lora? </i>

19:37.147 --> 19:39.081
[Woman]
Lora.
Oh, excuse me.

19:39.149 --> 19:41.447
Nothing in it for me,
honey,

19:41.518 --> 19:44.885
but they're
beginning to cast a new
Tennessee Williams play.

19:44.955 --> 19:47.890
Oh, what agent?
Allen Loomis... today.

19:47.958 --> 19:50.791
So put on
your roller skates.
Oh, thanks, Fay.

19:51.928 --> 19:53.862
Coffee?
I'm sorry,
but I've got to go.

19:53.930 --> 19:55.864
You haven't eaten.
You go ahead.
Good-bye.

19:55.932 --> 19:57.866
How about dinner?
Tonight?
We'll take Susie.

19:57.934 --> 19:59.902
Fine.
Where?

19:59.970 --> 20:01.938
Come and have
dinner with us.
All right.

20:02.005 --> 20:03.939
Good luck.
Thanks, Fay.

20:12.448 --> 20:15.781
But when can I have
an appointment?

20:15.852 --> 20:20.619
[Sighing]
How about a week
from today? Thursday.

20:20.690 --> 20:25.218
Put me down.
It's Iris Dawn.
Don't forget it.

20:25.294 --> 20:27.228
Tsk.

20:27.296 --> 20:29.696
I'm sorry to add
to your troubles, but...

20:29.765 --> 20:32.359
I'm afraid I'm a little late
for my appointment.

20:32.435 --> 20:35.632
Name, please.
Miss Meredith.

20:35.705 --> 20:38.003
Mered...
Meredith.

20:38.074 --> 20:40.042
Well, I don't seem
to have you down.

20:40.109 --> 20:43.203
Never mind.
Just tell Mr. Loomis
that Robert Hayes sent me.

20:43.279 --> 20:46.680
Robert Hayes?
<i>From International</i>
<i>Studio. </i>

20:46.749 --> 20:50.150
It's probably just a slipup
from the coast, but, uh,

20:50.219 --> 20:52.153
Mr. Hayes won't
like it at all.

20:52.221 --> 20:54.883
<i>I hope you didn't</i>
<i>slip up. </i>
Me?

20:54.957 --> 20:58.586
Well, if you say
there's no appointment,
um, good-bye.

20:58.661 --> 21:00.720
Well, just a second.

21:00.796 --> 21:05.233
Why don't you sit down
and I'll see if I can
straighten this out?

21:05.301 --> 21:07.496
Thank you.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.504
Mr. Loomis?
Yes?

21:09.572 --> 21:11.665
There's a Miss Meredith here
from Hollywood.

21:11.741 --> 21:15.268
<i>[Receptionist Whispering]</i>
<i>Yes, quite lovely. </i>

21:15.344 --> 21:19.747
Think we should
send her away?
No. I think
you ought to see her.

21:19.815 --> 21:22.409
Fine.
Okay.

21:23.986 --> 21:27.888
Miss Meredith?
You can go in now.

21:32.128 --> 21:35.222
Um, just right in.

21:35.298 --> 21:37.357
Robert sends
his warmest greetings.

21:37.433 --> 21:40.800
Well, thanks.
And how is he?
Marvelous.

21:40.870 --> 21:44.328
He's lost 15 pounds.
You know what an effort
that is for him.

21:44.407 --> 21:46.875
And, uh, what can
I do for you?

21:46.943 --> 21:52.006
Robert thought I shouldn't
do any more pictures before
I did a show on Broadway.

21:52.081 --> 21:54.208
Very sensible.
<i>I'm glad</i>
<i>you think so too. </i>

21:54.283 --> 21:58.617
That's why Robert
sent me to you.
He thought I'd get more...

21:58.688 --> 22:01.555
personal attention
from you.

22:01.624 --> 22:04.889
He could be right there.
You mind?
<i>No. </i>

22:04.961 --> 22:07.555
Incidentally, how's the new
Tennessee Williams play?

22:07.630 --> 22:13.034
Bound to be a blockbuster,
but all cast.
<i>[Buzzer Buzzing]</i>

22:13.102 --> 22:16.833

22:16.906 --> 22:20.069
<i>Oh, well, </i>
<i>can't you break it? </i>

22:20.142 --> 22:22.610
<i>Oh. No, I don't mind. </i>

22:22.678 --> 22:26.808
I don't mind you
standing me up. I'm fine.
I'll just kill myself.

22:26.882 --> 22:28.816
Yeah.

22:28.884 --> 22:34.151
<i>Never be a bachelor. </i>
<i>There's no security. </i>
I know how you feel.

22:34.223 --> 22:37.659
Yeah? Say, how'd you like
to go with me tonight?

22:37.727 --> 22:40.161
I'm afraid I can't.

22:40.229 --> 22:42.322
Big party.
Lots of important people.

22:42.398 --> 22:47.131
Well, I could see if I could
break a couple of engagements.

22:47.203 --> 22:49.137
I'll call my place.

22:49.205 --> 22:51.469
I'll call.
What's the number?

22:51.540 --> 22:54.236

23:07.690 --> 23:11.456
That'll be Annie, my maid.
I'll talk to her.

cocktails and dinner with him.

Oh, yes, Miss Lora,

23:28.577 --> 23:31.045
Thank you.

Well, Mr. Loomis,
it looks like I'm free.

23:33.215 --> 23:36.480
That'll be just fine.
Should be an interesting
evening for me.

23:45.194 --> 23:49.130
International Studios,
right? International...
Um.

23:49.198 --> 23:52.565
Maybe you better not
go through with that call.

23:52.635 --> 23:55.763
You don't think so?
Why not?

23:55.838 --> 23:57.829
[Sighing]

23:57.907 --> 24:00.967
Because Robert Hayes
doesn't exist.

24:01.043 --> 24:05.537
I understand.
Annette, cancel the call.

24:05.614 --> 24:07.548
<i>Yes, Mr. Loomis. </i>
I was desperate.

24:07.616 --> 24:11.552
You were pretty good.
You lied. All actresses lie.
I know that.

24:11.620 --> 24:14.646
But I believed you.
I'm sorry.

24:14.723 --> 24:18.022
Don't leave.
You took me in.

24:18.094 --> 24:21.029
For all of 20 seconds,
you took me in,
but I don't mind.

24:21.097 --> 24:25.431
It was a good acting job,
and you're very pretty.

24:25.501 --> 24:28.061
Now, about tonight.
Shall I pick you up?

24:28.137 --> 24:31.698
Um, no, it'll be easier
for me to meet you here.

24:31.774 --> 24:35.835
8:00?
You'll find me
very prompt, Mr. Loomis.

24:50.926 --> 24:54.259
[Gate Thumping]

24:59.568 --> 25:01.502
Come on in.

25:01.570 --> 25:05.597
Sit down. I just have
a few letters to sign.

25:05.674 --> 25:07.835
Oh, drink?
No, thank you.

25:07.910 --> 25:12.210
But aren't we going
to be late to the party?
Plenty of time, plenty.

25:12.281 --> 25:15.910
And I need a drink.
So relax.

25:15.985 --> 25:19.079
<i>Say, you're not allergic</i>
<i>to mink, are you? </i>

25:19.155 --> 25:22.852
Mink? No,
I don't think so.
<i>Good. </i>

25:28.631 --> 25:31.862

25:31.934 --> 25:35.426
But whose is it?
Mine. And I only loan it
to very special clients.

25:35.504 --> 25:37.699
I want you to wear it
tonight.
You want me to wear...

25:37.773 --> 25:39.707
Please. Got to think
of my reputation.

25:39.775 --> 25:43.711
I haven't been seen
with a girl without a mink
since the heat wave of'39.

25:43.779 --> 25:46.179
Come on.

25:46.248 --> 25:49.547
We should spend
a little time talking
about our future.

25:49.618 --> 25:52.985
You can act. Well,
that's of no importance
at the moment.

25:53.055 --> 25:55.888
The main thing is,
you're a beaut.

25:55.958 --> 26:00.019
Please, don't.
Oh, and you're decent too.

26:00.095 --> 26:02.063
No doubt possess
some fine principles.

26:02.131 --> 26:04.395
Well, me, I'm a man
of very few principles,

26:04.466 --> 26:06.900
and they're all open
to revision.

26:06.969 --> 26:09.494
But I'm in a position
to do something for you.

26:09.572 --> 26:12.564
You'll get 10% of everything
I make. Isn't that enough?

26:12.641 --> 26:15.132
No. Now,
sit down and listen.

26:16.946 --> 26:21.883
Here it is, short and clear.
You're not a chicken.

26:21.951 --> 26:23.942
You're no high-hearted kid
out of some drama school,

26:24.019 --> 26:26.078
wanting to do or die
for dear old Thespis.

26:26.155 --> 26:28.146
<i>And you're beginning</i>
<i>under a handicap. </i>

26:28.224 --> 26:31.057
I know I'm starting late.
<i>So time isn't on your side. </i>

26:31.126 --> 26:33.594
But you do have
some qualifications.

26:33.662 --> 26:37.962
Your face will pass.
You've good, nice, long
silky legs. I like them.

26:38.033 --> 26:40.524
You have a chest full
of quality and quantity.
I like it.

26:40.603 --> 26:44.801
Aren't you taking
a few things for granted?
Me? I don't count.

26:44.873 --> 26:47.808
But there are certain
people who do, and you're
going to meet all of them.

26:47.876 --> 26:50.811
That is, if you're really
serious about your career.

26:50.879 --> 26:54.440
I am, but...
Good, then you're going
every place with me.

26:54.516 --> 26:57.280
Every party, opening night,
every saloon in town.

26:57.353 --> 27:00.322
With a complete new
wardrobe at my expense.

27:00.389 --> 27:02.289
Oh, it's tax deductible.

27:02.358 --> 27:04.918
This is a tough,
competitive racket.

27:04.994 --> 27:07.929
Although it's a lot
more than any agent
is supposed to do,

27:07.997 --> 27:11.228
I'd do it.
<i>[Hand Patting Leg]</i>

27:11.300 --> 27:13.393
What's this got
to do with acting?
Nothing.

27:13.469 --> 27:17.269
But I'll show you how to
realize your ambitions,
if you do as I say.

27:17.339 --> 27:20.934
If the dramatists' club wants
to eat and sleep with you,
you eat and sleep with them.

27:21.010 --> 27:24.138
If some producer with a hand
as cold as a toad wants to do
a painting of you in the nude,

27:24.213 --> 27:26.147
you'll accommodate him
for a very small part.

27:26.215 --> 27:28.547
It's disgusting!
It pays off.

27:28.617 --> 27:30.551
You're disgusting.
Maybe I am.

27:30.619 --> 27:34.555
But let me assure you,
once you get it made,

27:34.623 --> 27:37.490
you can be idealistic
all of ten seconds
before you die.

27:37.559 --> 27:41.427
You're trying to cheapen me.
But you won't. Not me.

27:41.497 --> 27:44.898
Oh, I'll make it, Mr. Loomis,
but it'll be my way.

27:55.176 --> 27:57.610
You have a wonderful
handwriting, Annie.

27:57.679 --> 28:01.513
Oh, thank you, Mr. Steve.
But my spellin'
won't take no prizes.

28:01.583 --> 28:04.211
I don't think Lora
has anything to worry about
as long as you're with her.

28:04.285 --> 28:07.584
Oh, we'll get by.
I made an agreement
with the landlord.

28:07.655 --> 28:09.748
He's really
a nice person.
Oh?

28:09.824 --> 28:13.260
Just for doin'
the staircases twice a week,
we get $10 off our rent.

28:13.328 --> 28:15.262
Is that a fact?

28:15.330 --> 28:18.299
I answered an ad
and got a job while
the kids are at school.

28:18.366 --> 28:20.994
Doing what?
Doing shirts
for a gentleman.

28:21.069 --> 28:24.470
He's real persnickety
about his shirts.
<i>[Door Opening]</i>

28:45.860 --> 28:48.693
Oh, Steve.
Hello.

28:48.763 --> 28:51.823
I'm sorry. It's just
that I got so involved.

28:51.900 --> 28:55.233
We're having
a wonderful time.
How'd everything go?

28:55.303 --> 28:59.262
Oh, just fine. I went
to the 21 with Mr. Loomis.

28:59.340 --> 29:02.036
Everybody there
was somebody exciting.

29:02.110 --> 29:04.806
For the first time,
I felt that I was somebody too.

29:04.879 --> 29:06.904
Is Mr. Loomis gonna
find you a job?

29:06.981 --> 29:10.212
Well, he, uh,

29:10.285 --> 29:13.584
he wanted to represent me,
but...

29:17.058 --> 29:20.516
But l...
Oh, Annie.

29:20.595 --> 29:23.587
What's wrong, Miss Lora?
[Crying]

29:23.665 --> 29:27.192
Everything. Everything.

29:27.268 --> 29:32.638
Now, you just rest.
Everything will work out.

29:32.707 --> 29:37.041
I'll go get you
a glass of hot milk, huh?

29:46.054 --> 29:49.182
Can I help in any way?
No.

29:49.257 --> 29:52.158
No one can.

29:52.226 --> 29:54.626
No one.

29:54.696 --> 29:57.358
I'm so ashamed.

29:58.733 --> 30:01.861
It was horrible.

30:01.936 --> 30:04.962
He tried to make me
feel so cheap.

30:05.039 --> 30:06.973
You could never
be cheap.

30:07.041 --> 30:10.499
You don't know
what I mean.
Yes, I do.

30:10.578 --> 30:13.911
It happens all the time.
Not just in the theater.

30:13.982 --> 30:16.883
I love the theater.
It's what I want.

30:16.951 --> 30:21.217
Then hold onto your dreams.
Forget tonight.

30:21.289 --> 30:25.589
But they seem so stale
after tonight.

30:25.660 --> 30:30.688
So stale I can't believe
in them anymore.

30:30.765 --> 30:34.098
M-Maybe I'm a fool.

30:35.837 --> 30:39.603
Maybe I should see things
as they really are...

30:39.674 --> 30:43.542
and not as
I want them to be.

30:43.611 --> 30:48.378
If I know you,
they'll have to be
the way you want them.

30:50.685 --> 30:52.915
Thanks, Steve.

30:52.987 --> 30:58.220
You're so, so good
for what ails me.

30:58.292 --> 31:03.195
It's all part of
the Archer service...
day or night.

31:04.265 --> 31:07.564
I'll call you soon,
Lora.

31:07.635 --> 31:09.603
Tomorrow.

31:09.670 --> 31:11.604
Yes, please, tomorrow.

31:37.365 --> 31:41.461
<i>Annie, what's happened</i>
<i>to Susie's wrist? </i>

31:41.536 --> 31:45.666
Oh, nothin' serious.
Just a little experiment.

31:45.740 --> 31:47.970
Experiment?
Sarah Jane's fault.

31:48.042 --> 31:52.570
After class, one of the kids
said that Negro blood
was different.

31:52.647 --> 31:56.674
So later this evenin',
Sarah Jane wanted to compare
her blood with Susie's.

31:56.751 --> 31:59.345
Well, I spanked her good.

31:59.420 --> 32:03.015
Oh, well, you know
how children are.

32:03.091 --> 32:05.855
They were only playing.

32:05.927 --> 32:09.863
I hope so, Miss Lora.
I hope so.

32:16.566 --> 32:20.434
Santa Claus has many names
in many different countries.

32:20.503 --> 32:22.937
In Holland, he is
called <i>Sinter Klaas. </i>

32:23.006 --> 32:27.067
<i>In France, </i>
Saint Nicolas.

32:27.143 --> 32:29.543
In Sweden, he is
known as <i>Jul Tomte. </i>

32:29.613 --> 32:33.071
In Germany, he is...
<i>[Knocking]</i>

32:35.452 --> 32:37.420
Oh, can I do something
for you?

32:37.487 --> 32:39.819
<i>Sorry to trouble you, </i>
<i>but I brought these</i>
<i>for my little girl. </i>

32:39.889 --> 32:41.982
I'm afraid you've
made a mistake.

32:42.058 --> 32:43.992
I don't have any little
colored girl in my class.

32:44.060 --> 32:46.790
But they said 3-B.
This is 3-B, isn't...

32:47.831 --> 32:50.322
Why, there's Sarah Jane.

32:50.400 --> 32:53.301
There's my baby.
You mean Sarah Jane
Johnson?

32:53.370 --> 32:56.168
Yes, ma'am.
I'm Mrs. Johnson.

33:00.777 --> 33:04.838
Sarah Jane, baby,
I brought you your...

33:06.516 --> 33:08.848
Sarah Jane!
We didn't know.

33:10.186 --> 33:13.747
<i>Sarah Jane? </i>
<i>Wait. </i>

33:13.823 --> 33:16.383
<i>Sarah Jane? </i>

33:16.459 --> 33:19.053
Baby? Wait.

33:22.132 --> 33:24.498
Sarah Jane?

33:26.469 --> 33:29.233
Sarah Jane, wait.

33:29.306 --> 33:34.300
Wait. Now, now,
let me do it.

33:34.377 --> 33:37.904
Now, put your coat on.
What do you want to do,
catch pneumonia?

33:37.981 --> 33:41.178
I hope I do!
I hope I die!

33:41.251 --> 33:43.276
Honey, nothing's hurt.
You shouldn't
have let them...

33:43.353 --> 33:46.652
They didn't ask me.
Why should I tell them?

33:46.723 --> 33:49.317
Because that's what you
are, and it's nothin'
to be ashamed of.

33:49.392 --> 33:53.328
Why do you have to be
my mother? Why?

33:59.302 --> 34:03.204
Why, you're
practically normal.

I'll be fine.
You better get ready.
Mr. Steve's comin'.

34:27.163 --> 34:31.031
Serve him right to wait.
He was due here
over an hour ago.

34:31.101 --> 34:35.936
I just don't want
everybody having colds.
Cups and...

34:36.005 --> 34:39.270
What's wrong?

34:39.342 --> 34:42.800
Sarah Jane's been
passing at school,

34:42.879 --> 34:44.870
pretending she's white.

34:44.947 --> 34:48.145
But I am white!
I'm as white as Susie.

34:51.855 --> 34:57.350
Oh, honey,
don't you see it doesn't
make any difference to us?

34:57.427 --> 35:01.158
Because we all love you.

35:01.231 --> 35:03.131
I'll take you back
to school myself.

35:03.199 --> 35:05.190
I'm never going back
to that school!

35:05.268 --> 35:08.999
Never as long as I live!

<i>[Door Slamming]</i>
Sarah Jane!
Don't cry!

35:15.078 --> 35:18.741
Annie, don't be upset.
Children are always pretending.

35:18.815 --> 35:21.249
You know that.

35:21.317 --> 35:27.153
No, it's a sin to be
ashamed of what you are.

35:27.223 --> 35:30.556
It's even worse to pretend,

35:30.627 --> 35:32.891
to lie.

35:32.962 --> 35:37.490
Sarah Jane has to learn
that the Lord must
have had his reasons...

35:37.567 --> 35:39.762
for making some
of us white...

35:39.836 --> 35:41.861
and some of us black.

35:41.938 --> 35:43.929
Sarah Jane Doesn't
want me with her.

35:44.007 --> 35:47.568
She says I'm not her friend.
She says nobody's
her friend.

Darling, she's upset right now.
But she'll be better soon.

35:51.314 --> 35:54.647
So will you if you get
back in bed. Come on.

35:57.420 --> 36:01.857
Don't worry, Annie.
I'm sure you'll be able
to explain things to her.

36:01.925 --> 36:05.088
I don't know.

you'd never get here.

36:36.325 --> 36:38.316
Why, Steve, you sold it!

36:38.394 --> 36:42.353
More than that, they gave me
a job, a steady one

Well, it's not
The Museum of Modern Art.

But they pay you
in the nicest-looking
green folding money.

Which reminds me,
this is the season
for spending it.

36:57.813 --> 37:00.247

We have to get a tree,

And I hope you like
what I picked out for you.

37:07.022 --> 37:10.355
Oh, Steve, you...
You have to have something
to put under a tree, don't you?

37:10.426 --> 37:12.587
Well, I know, but...
This way, ma'am.

37:12.661 --> 37:14.925
Oh, I feel awful.

have to marry me.

It's the least you can do
for me for Christmas.

37:28.610 --> 37:30.703
I love you.

But, darling, you're...

37:33.515 --> 37:36.609
You're just
getting started and...

37:36.685 --> 37:38.619
It would be foolish.

37:38.687 --> 37:41.178
At least we'd
be foolish together.

37:41.256 --> 37:44.123
But marriage
is such a big step.

37:44.193 --> 37:47.890
I want us to be together.
Well, we are,
most of the time.

37:47.963 --> 37:50.591
Most of the time
you're out fighting
to get somewhere.

Breaking your heart,
trying to do for
yourself and Susie...

37:52.701 --> 37:55.226
what I want to do for you,
what I finally
can do for you.

Maybe too much.

Don't think I want any less.

So let's settle something

39:48.250 --> 39:50.684
He saw that picture
in a magazine.

39:50.752 --> 39:54.688
He's looking for a girl with
that certain <i>je ne sais quoi</i>
for his new play.

39:54.756 --> 39:58.021
That certain something
you managed to get
with the dog.

39:58.093 --> 40:01.995
It's not a big part, I know...
If this is one of
your jokes, Mr. Loomis...

40:02.064 --> 40:04.999
Jokes? So help me,
I'm only thinking
percentage-wise.

40:05.067 --> 40:07.501
The part calls for
about...
Two and a half.

40:07.569 --> 40:10.003
Two-fifty a week.

40:10.072 --> 40:13.405
I left the script with
my secretary. Can you
pick it up immediately?

40:13.475 --> 40:15.966
Uh, yes.
Yes, Mr. Loomis.

40:16.044 --> 40:17.978
Yes.

40:18.046 --> 40:20.981
He wants me
to pick up a script;
I'm to audition tomorrow.

40:21.049 --> 40:22.983
And you're going
down there?
Of course.

40:23.051 --> 40:26.487
Even after what
happened last time?
This has
nothing to do with Loomis.

40:26.555 --> 40:29.991
I'm to audition
for David Edwards.
How do you know that?

40:30.058 --> 40:31.992
I know. I just know.

40:32.060 --> 40:35.996
But do you know if he's
gonna be any different
than Loomis?
No, I don't.

40:36.064 --> 40:40.524
I don't want you to go.
Don't you realize what
this could mean to me?

40:40.602 --> 40:44.038
I'm not asking you
not to go down there,
I'm <i>telling</i> you.

40:44.106 --> 40:47.542
What makes you think
you have that right?
Because I love you.

40:47.609 --> 40:50.544
Isn't that enough?
No, Steve, I'm sorry.
Good night.

40:52.014 --> 40:54.812
Lora, wait.

40:54.883 --> 40:58.319
I didn't mean
to sound dictatorial or
to try to run your life,

40:58.387 --> 41:01.823
but you have to understand
how I feel.
And what about
the way I feel?

41:01.890 --> 41:04.256
Oh, stop acting.
I'm not acting.

41:04.326 --> 41:07.261
I want to achieve something,
something you'll never
understand.

41:07.329 --> 41:10.821
What you're after isn't real.
At least
I'm after something!

41:10.899 --> 41:14.335
Not the snapshot of
a disgusting old man with
a beer can on his belly.

41:14.403 --> 41:17.839
Is that your idea
of achieving something?
Is a beer can "real"?

41:17.906 --> 41:19.840
Going up and down,
up and down.

41:19.908 --> 41:23.344
Well, I'm going up and up
and up, and nobody's
going to pull me down!

41:23.412 --> 41:25.607
Lora, listen, please.

41:25.681 --> 41:29.117
I've been trying to do
something with my pictures.
It's meant everything to me.

41:29.184 --> 41:32.119
Every minute,
for a long time now.
No, it hasn't.

41:32.187 --> 41:35.315
Or you wouldn't
give it up to sell beer.

41:35.390 --> 41:39.326
I gave it up for
something much better,
something right now: You.

41:39.394 --> 41:42.830
But you're asking me
to give up something
I've wanted all my life,

41:42.898 --> 41:45.833
ever since I was a child,
and I can't do it!

41:45.901 --> 41:47.835
If you grew up,
you could.

41:49.237 --> 41:51.171
What do you mean?

41:52.374 --> 41:54.308
You're not
a child anymore,

41:54.376 --> 41:57.311
and I might not be around
to pick up the pieces
this time.

41:57.379 --> 41:59.313
Good.

41:59.381 --> 42:02.111
I'd like it that way.
Forever.

42:17.933 --> 42:21.869
Joseph and Mary couldn't
find no place at the inn,

42:21.937 --> 42:25.373
so they had to go to the
stable among the animals.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.374
The animals?
Mm-hmm.

42:27.442 --> 42:30.377
And in the manger
Jesus was born.

42:30.445 --> 42:34.040
<i>And the heavenly hosts</i>
<i>sang, "Hallelujah. "</i>

42:34.116 --> 42:37.051
<i>There was a shining bright</i>
<i>star in the sky, </i>

42:37.119 --> 42:41.055
<i>and it was</i>
<i>a beautiful time. </i>
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

42:41.123 --> 42:44.559

Mr. Steve again.
<i>[Ringing Continues]</i>

42:48.964 --> 42:51.023
Hello?
Hello, Annie.

42:51.099 --> 42:54.262
- Oh, hello, Mr. Steve.
- Has she come in yet?

42:54.336 --> 42:56.463
I'm sorry.

42:56.538 --> 42:58.472
I see.

42:58.540 --> 43:00.599
Well, Merry Christmas,
Annie.

43:00.675 --> 43:02.802
Merry Christmas to you,
Mr. Steve.

43:02.878 --> 43:05.904
Mommy, isn't Steve
coming here tonight?

43:05.981 --> 43:08.916
I think you'd better
go to bed, both of you.

43:08.984 --> 43:11.350
But Annie was
telling us a story.

43:11.420 --> 43:14.355
Oh, all right,
Annie can finish it.
Where were we?

43:14.423 --> 43:16.687
- Jesus was almost borned.
- That's right.

43:16.758 --> 43:21.957
As soon as the holy infant
was born, three wise men saw
a beautiful star in the sky.

43:22.030 --> 43:24.965
The star
of Bethlehem...
Was Jesus white or black?

43:25.033 --> 43:27.968
It doesn't matter.
He's the way
you imagine him.

43:28.036 --> 43:30.698
But Annie said
he was a real man.

43:30.772 --> 43:32.706
He's not a pretend man.

43:32.774 --> 43:34.833
He was real.
He <i>is</i> real.

43:34.910 --> 43:36.844
Then what color was he?

43:36.912 --> 43:39.346
He was like me...
White.

43:43.514 --> 43:46.415
Now, the closet door
is over here.

43:46.483 --> 43:49.646
The clothes closet door
is over there.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.655
The door to your bedroom
is over here.

43:52.723 --> 43:56.159
And you trip over
the vacuum cleaner
over there.

43:58.061 --> 44:01.053
All right,

I guarantee it.

a little nervous.
Miss Meredith.

44:35.933 --> 44:38.026
Yes, sir?

44:38.101 --> 44:41.764
This scene is supposed to
be played for high comedy,
with delicate reactions,

44:41.838 --> 44:43.772
not loud,
goggle-eyed takes.

44:45.342 --> 44:47.333
I'm sorry, Mr. Edwards.

44:47.411 --> 44:51.438
But I'm an actress,
and a good one.

44:51.515 --> 44:55.178
But I couldn't play
this part for high comedy.
Nobody could.

44:55.252 --> 44:58.949
<i>Nobody. </i>
I think that's all,
Miss Meredith.

44:59.022 --> 45:01.957
<i>And if you'll forgive me</i>
<i>for saying it, </i>

45:02.025 --> 45:04.960
you're too good a writer
to have such a scene
in your play.

45:05.028 --> 45:07.861
Okay, sister,
this way out.

45:07.931 --> 45:12.425
I might as well confess...
She's not really my client.
Tell her to wait a minute.

45:16.974 --> 45:20.933
Lora!
Lora, wait a minute.

45:21.011 --> 45:23.946
I think we've still
got a chance.
No, I don't...

45:24.014 --> 45:25.948
Miss Meredith.

45:27.184 --> 45:30.415
It's been a long time
since anyone told me off.

45:30.487 --> 45:33.923
Tell me, what would you do
with that scene?

45:35.792 --> 45:38.727
I'd cut it out.
Drop it entirely.

45:39.796 --> 45:42.924
That's not a bad idea.
Let me think.

45:43.000 --> 45:46.834
Yes, but the scene
has a couple of lines
that are important.

45:46.903 --> 45:48.837
Give them to Amy.

45:50.007 --> 45:52.066
Yes, it would work.

45:53.277 --> 45:55.541
Ha!
Think you could play Amy?

45:57.347 --> 46:00.009
Amy?

46:00.083 --> 46:03.519
Of course we'll have to
work very hard together.
I'd love it.

So would I. Tom?
<i>Yes, Mr. Edwards. </i>

53:12.482 --> 53:14.746
No.

53:14.817 --> 53:17.911
But he's good for me
in many ways.

53:17.987 --> 53:21.423
At least I'm trying to
make myself think he is.

53:21.491 --> 53:24.927
And of course it...
It would be better
for Susie.

53:24.994 --> 53:27.428
This ain't no time
to make decisions.

53:27.497 --> 53:30.432
You're tired, and you don't
know what you want.

53:33.002 --> 53:35.937
Maybe I don't want
so much anymore.

53:36.005 --> 53:39.941
But what would you do
if you gave it all up?

53:40.009 --> 53:43.445
Well, I could spend
more time with Susie.

53:43.513 --> 53:46.448
And you could stay home
with Sarah Jane.

53:47.517 --> 53:49.451
Do you know,

53:49.519 --> 53:52.955
I haven't been up to see
my baby at school in weeks.

53:53.022 --> 53:54.956
Susie knows you love her.

53:55.024 --> 53:58.960

as much as it needs you.

I do without you?

from Susie's new school?
Mm-hmm.

And it doesn't matter.
But Miss Lora...

No matter what it costs,
Susie's going to have
everything that I missed.

From her letters
she misses you more than

She just wrote
and told me...
Annie.

You still haven't told me what
the doctor said about those
spells you've been getting.

What do doctors always say
when they can't find nothin'
wrong? "Take it easy."

55:31.320 --> 55:33.754
Well, do.
And I mean it.
Oh, Miss Lora...

A long one. It's quite
a trek from Manhattan.

Uh-huh.

my new play?

Great, isn't it?
[Sighs]
Yes, it's very good.

But David...

I should do another comedy.

56:36.985 --> 56:38.919
No, no, wait a minute.

56:38.987 --> 56:43.924
I've decided to do
the new Stewart play.
That? What part?

Not the dull social worker
with the high dreams
and low heels.

56:47.996 --> 56:50.191
Yes.
It's drama.
No clothes, no sex.

56:50.265 --> 56:52.392
No fun!
I know.

56:52.468 --> 56:55.403
But it's a great chance for...
For good acting.

56:55.471 --> 56:58.406

<i>in it, it's absolutely</i>
<i>controversial. </i>

56:58.474 --> 57:00.999
<i>- What do you know</i>

- Nothing.

57:01.076 --> 57:03.010

I only know it's a good script,
and they're not easy to find.

57:07.082 --> 57:11.951
Besides, l, I feel I need
something different,
a new experience.

<i>All right, </i>
<i>if you want a flop, </i>
<i>have it on your own time. </i>

to your every mood.

I never wrote
better laughs
in my life!

you want controversy.
Hmph!

It may sound ungrateful,
after all you've done for me.

57:29.037 --> 57:30.971
You're right.
It is ungrateful.

57:31.039 --> 57:32.973
But then I never
expected gratitude.

57:33.041 --> 57:36.340
Personally,
I couldn't stand it.

it will be a hit.

01:05:04.325 --> 01:05:09.262
I can cross off pink sweater
for Elizabeth and yellow
sweater for Sarah Jane.

01:05:09.330 --> 01:05:11.264
Then we skip ahead
to algebra.

01:05:11.332 --> 01:05:15.268
Do you think another year of
that stuff is a good idea?
I sure do.

01:05:15.336 --> 01:05:18.772
It's gonna come in
mighty handy with prices
always goin' up.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:21.274
Which brings us
back to boys.

01:05:21.342 --> 01:05:24.277
What do you think
about kissing, Annie?
[Laughs]

01:05:24.345 --> 01:05:28.042
Well, there's kissin'
and <i>kissin'. </i>

01:05:28.116 --> 01:05:31.051
I still take pictures
every chance I get.

01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:33.553
Still trying
to get them exhibited.
Stop hedging.

01:05:33.621 --> 01:05:35.555
What is your job,
really?

01:05:35.623 --> 01:05:38.558
I'm Vice President
in Charge of Advertising
for P.C. Beer.

01:05:38.626 --> 01:05:41.561
Don't tell anybody.
Why not?
I think it's wonderful.

01:05:41.629 --> 01:05:46.328
'Cause I'm quitting
just as soon as I can
wind things up.
But why?

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:49.837
You ever get the feeling
that you're tired of
what you're doing,

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.338
that it isn't all
you really wanted?

01:05:52.407 --> 01:05:56.343
Did you ever get the urge
not to do what you don't
want to do?

01:05:56.411 --> 01:06:00.347
To let yourself go
and follow the wind
or a star,

01:06:00.415 --> 01:06:02.849
maybe even
a dusty old rainbow?

01:06:02.917 --> 01:06:04.851
Yes.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:06.853
Well, that's why
I'm going.

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:08.855
Where to?

01:06:08.923 --> 01:06:12.290
I don't know.
Around the world,
I guess, for a start.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:14.294
You going alone?

01:06:14.362 --> 01:06:18.924
I'm afraid so, l...
I went through my entire
little black book.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.935
Well, you shouldn't have
skipped my name.

01:06:23.037 --> 01:06:26.871
l... I don't know why
I said that, Steve,

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:30.377
except that
I haven't been this happy
with anyone for years.

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:35.007
You know I still have you
in my blood, don't you?
Oh, Steve, do you really?

01:06:36.584 --> 01:06:39.018
I never got over you,
Lora.

01:06:39.087 --> 01:06:42.181
No matter how hard I tried,
I couldn't.

01:06:45.093 --> 01:06:48.529
There's a kind of kissin'
that's not careless
and doesn't lead to harm,

01:06:48.596 --> 01:06:51.531
when the two people kissin'
are nice and right.

01:06:51.599 --> 01:06:53.533
Kissin' is part of
fallin' in love.

01:06:53.601 --> 01:06:56.035
The Lord
wants his children
to fall in love,

01:06:56.104 --> 01:06:58.538
when they're old enough
and got sense enough.

01:06:58.606 --> 01:07:01.541
Then kissin' is like
yeast is to bread...

01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:05.204
Pardon me, Annie,
but I'm starving.
Can't I please find Steve?

01:07:05.279 --> 01:07:07.213
Don't think
you'll have to.

01:07:07.281 --> 01:07:11.149
Steve! It's time
to cook the steaks!
Even Annie says so!

01:07:11.219 --> 01:07:13.153
[Lora, Susie Giggling]

01:07:13.221 --> 01:07:16.156
Telling them
will be wonderful,
but Loomis, ohh.

01:07:16.224 --> 01:07:20.160
Why tell him at all?
He has a lot of commitments
he'll have to get me out of.

01:07:20.228 --> 01:07:23.493
<i>[Annie]</i>
<i>Susie, will you go see</i>
<i>how Sarah Jane is? </i>

01:07:23.564 --> 01:07:26.328
Tell her
I'll be right up.
Okay.

01:07:27.635 --> 01:07:31.162
Let me help you
with that.
Thank you, honey.

01:07:34.242 --> 01:07:36.767
Hello, Allen?
l...

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.779
You've been trying
to call me?

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:42.281
I'm sorry.
We've been out all day.

01:07:42.350 --> 01:07:44.841
<i>When? </i>

01:07:44.919 --> 01:07:49.356
Oh. Well, that sounds
simply marvelous, but...

01:07:49.424 --> 01:07:52.359
Uh, no, not for dinner.
I'm having guests.

01:07:53.694 --> 01:07:56.629
Why don't you bring him
for cocktails.

01:07:56.697 --> 01:07:59.188
Yes. All right.

01:08:00.935 --> 01:08:04.132
Steve!
Amerigo Felluci!

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:06.673
The Italian
movie director.
<i>Yes. </i>

01:08:06.741 --> 01:08:11.201
Oh, he wants me
for the part of Rena
in <i>No More Laughter. </i>

01:08:11.279 --> 01:08:15.613
<i>His agent is in New York</i>
<i>now to talk to me about it. </i>
I see.

01:08:15.683 --> 01:08:19.118
- That means you'd
have to go to Italy.
- Mmm. Of course.

01:08:20.354 --> 01:08:22.287
Oh.

01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:27.490
Well, I'll have to
give a two-week notice
to the play.

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.826
Yes.

01:08:29.897 --> 01:08:32.058
Well,
don't be so calm.

01:08:32.133 --> 01:08:34.067
They want me
for Rena!

01:08:34.135 --> 01:08:38.572
Well, who is she?
Only the best part
since Scarlett O'Hara.

01:08:42.777 --> 01:08:45.678
Sarah Jane?

01:09:06.033 --> 01:09:08.968
Sarah Jane!
Where have you been?

01:09:09.036 --> 01:09:12.971
I've been looking all over
for you! You're supposed
to be in bed...
Shh!

01:09:20.113 --> 01:09:22.048
Uh...

01:09:22.116 --> 01:09:24.050
Sit down.

01:09:25.953 --> 01:09:27.886
Cross your heart.

01:09:29.423 --> 01:09:32.358
You won't tell my mama?
No, I won't
tell Annie.

01:09:32.426 --> 01:09:34.859
W-Well, what is it?

01:09:35.796 --> 01:09:37.729
I've been out.

01:09:38.832 --> 01:09:41.198
With my boyfriend.

01:09:41.268 --> 01:09:45.203
Boyfriend?
I didn't know
you had a boyfriend!

01:09:45.272 --> 01:09:48.399
- Where's he from?
- The Village.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:51.912
Oh. Did you meet him
in school?
<i>School? </i>

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:54.914
No.

01:09:54.982 --> 01:09:57.917
There's an ice cream
parlor in The Village
with a jukebox.

01:09:57.985 --> 01:10:01.148
Yeah?
And he used to
stand outside,

01:10:01.222 --> 01:10:05.488
and every time I'd walk by,
he'd whistle!
No kidding!

01:10:05.559 --> 01:10:09.495
But first I pretended he
wasn't on earth.
Yeah?
[Giggles]

01:10:09.563 --> 01:10:12.498
But finally I had to laugh,
and he followed me.
<music> [Orchestra]

01:10:12.566 --> 01:10:15.000
And we started to talk.

01:10:15.069 --> 01:10:18.402
He's cute.
<i>Really</i> cute.
[Sighs]

01:10:18.472 --> 01:10:20.406
Is he a colored boy?

01:10:20.474 --> 01:10:23.739
Why did you ask that?
Well, I don't know.

01:10:23.811 --> 01:10:26.746
It just slipped out.
It was the first thing
you thought of.

01:10:26.814 --> 01:10:29.749
I told you,
it just slipped out!
Well, he's white.

01:10:29.817 --> 01:10:34.754
And if he ever finds out
about me, I'll kill myself.
But why?

01:10:34.822 --> 01:10:38.553
Because I'm white too.
And if I have to be colored,
then I want to die.

01:10:38.626 --> 01:10:41.595
What are you saying?
I wanna have
a chance in life.

01:10:41.662 --> 01:10:45.257
I don't wanna have to
come through back doors,
feel lower than other people,

01:10:45.332 --> 01:10:48.267
or apologize
for my mother's color.
Don't say that!

01:10:48.335 --> 01:10:51.498
She can't help her color,
but I can.

01:10:51.572 --> 01:10:53.506
And I will.

01:10:53.574 --> 01:10:56.008
But we've always
talked things over.

01:10:56.076 --> 01:10:58.704
You never told me
this before.

01:10:58.779 --> 01:11:00.713
<music> [Continues]

01:11:02.783 --> 01:11:05.718
Because I've never had
a boyfriend before.

01:11:07.288 --> 01:11:10.155
Because he wants to
marry me someday.

01:11:11.659 --> 01:11:14.594
A white boy.
Me.

01:11:14.662 --> 01:11:19.395
But how do you think
he'd feel, or his folks,
with a black in-law?

01:11:19.466 --> 01:11:23.402
What do you think people
would say where we lived
if they knew my mother...

01:11:23.470 --> 01:11:27.668
They'd spit at me.
And my children.

01:11:27.741 --> 01:11:30.676
Sarah Jane,
you know that's not true!
It is.

01:11:30.744 --> 01:11:33.178
That's why
he mustn't know her.

01:11:33.247 --> 01:11:35.681
I don't want anybody
to know her.

01:11:35.749 --> 01:11:39.685
What if he comes here?
He doesn't even know
where I live.

01:11:39.753 --> 01:11:43.189
I pretend I'm a...
I'm a rich girl
with strict parents.

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:45.885
Well, he's bound
to find out...
How?

01:11:47.194 --> 01:11:50.186
I'm going to be everything
he thinks I am.

01:11:50.264 --> 01:11:53.427
I look it, and that's
all that matters.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.936
And you're not to say
anything either.
I won't. You know I won't.

01:11:57.004 --> 01:11:58.938
I never did, but...

01:11:59.006 --> 01:12:02.601
Sarah Jane,
if Mama ever found out
she'd never stand for it.

01:12:02.676 --> 01:12:04.610
I don't care.

01:12:06.146 --> 01:12:08.580
Your mother
doesn't own me.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:13.917
I won't be seeing you
before you leave,
so good luck in Italy.

01:12:13.988 --> 01:12:15.922
You make that sound
like good-bye.

01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:18.925
Why couldn't
we meet in Italy?
What for?

01:12:18.993 --> 01:12:22.258
You'll have a film.
You won't need me.

01:12:22.329 --> 01:12:24.263
But Steve, wait.

01:12:24.331 --> 01:12:28.563
You tell Susie I'll
be at her graduation.
Good-bye, Lora.

01:12:34.108 --> 01:12:36.042
<i>[Car Door Opens]</i>

01:12:47.214 --> 01:12:49.375
Oh, Sarah Jane.
Yes, Miss Lora?

01:12:49.450 --> 01:12:52.385
I'm having
some people come
for a business meeting.

01:12:52.453 --> 01:12:56.389
Later the dinner guests
will arrive. Could you
help your mother a bit?

01:12:56.457 --> 01:12:59.324
Miss Lora,
l... l-I'd like to,
but I have a...

01:12:59.393 --> 01:13:02.760
A date?
Is it the Hawkins boy?

01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:04.764
Hawkins?

01:13:04.832 --> 01:13:08.563
<i>Well, the Miller's chauffeur</i>
<i>down the road. </i>
Why do you say that?

01:13:08.636 --> 01:13:12.163
I met him at the station
the other day
and he asked about you.

01:13:12.239 --> 01:13:15.174
No.
It's with someone else.

01:13:15.242 --> 01:13:17.176
Oh.

01:13:17.244 --> 01:13:20.680
All right, you run along.
I'll try to manage here.
<i>[Doorbell Rings]</i>

01:13:20.748 --> 01:13:22.682
Oh, there they are.

01:13:33.627 --> 01:13:37.654
Look, honey, why don't you
go over to the party
at the church?

01:13:37.731 --> 01:13:39.665
They bore me.

01:13:39.733 --> 01:13:44.670
You're makin' a big mistake.
You're young. You shouldn't
be sittin' around.

01:13:44.738 --> 01:13:46.672
Miss Lora
feels the same way.

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.677
She'll lend you
her car.
Oh, she will?
How nice of her.

01:13:51.745 --> 01:13:54.680
I'd be happy knowin'
you're meetin'
nice young folks.

01:13:54.748 --> 01:13:57.683
Busboys, cooks,
chauffeurs!

01:13:57.751 --> 01:14:00.686
Hmph.
Like Hawkins.

01:14:00.754 --> 01:14:04.190
No, thank you.
I've seen your
"nice young folks."

01:14:05.326 --> 01:14:08.261
I don't wanna fight
with you, honey.

01:14:08.329 --> 01:14:10.194
Not tonight.

01:14:10.264 --> 01:14:12.198
I don't feel too good.

01:14:12.266 --> 01:14:14.700
While I get started
on the anchovies,

01:14:14.768 --> 01:14:17.703
will you take this tray
into Miss Lora
and her friends?

01:14:17.771 --> 01:14:19.705
Why, certainly.

01:14:19.773 --> 01:14:22.708
Anything at all
for Miss Lora
and her friends.

01:14:25.479 --> 01:14:28.915
But signor Romano, why should
she need rehearsals?
<i>Ma scusa, signor. </i>

01:14:28.983 --> 01:14:30.917
You know her work.

01:14:30.985 --> 01:14:33.613
Felluci always insists
on two weeks' rehearsal.

01:14:33.687 --> 01:14:37.350
Pictures are a different
medium than the stage.
She will need rehearsal...

01:14:39.927 --> 01:14:44.091
Fetched y'all a mess
of crawdads, Miss Lora,
for you and yo' friends.

01:14:44.164 --> 01:14:48.157
That's quite a trick,
Sarah Jane.
Where did you learn it?

01:14:48.235 --> 01:14:50.669
Oh, no trick to totin',
Miss Lora.

01:14:50.738 --> 01:14:52.672
I learned it
from my mammy,

01:14:52.740 --> 01:14:56.676
and she learned it
from old massa 'fore
she belonged to you.

01:15:00.581 --> 01:15:02.515
Well...
Excuse me.

01:15:07.521 --> 01:15:09.455
Another drink,
Sr. Romano?

01:15:11.325 --> 01:15:14.761
Sarah Jane,
why did you do that?

01:15:14.828 --> 01:15:17.262
What's the matter
with you?

01:15:17.331 --> 01:15:20.596
Annie, did you see
what she did?
I heard her.

01:15:20.668 --> 01:15:24.104
You and my mother
are so anxious for me
to be colored.

01:15:25.172 --> 01:15:28.608
I was going to show you
I could be.

01:15:33.681 --> 01:15:35.979
You weren't being
colored.

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:37.984
You were being
childish.

01:15:38.052 --> 01:15:41.988
I don't understand why
you would want to hurt
your mother or me.

01:15:42.056 --> 01:15:44.991
I told her
she has to be patient.

01:15:45.059 --> 01:15:46.993
Things will work out.
How?

01:15:48.962 --> 01:15:52.329
Miss Lora, you don't know
what it means to be...

01:15:52.399 --> 01:15:54.333
different.

01:15:54.401 --> 01:15:59.065
Have I ever treated you
as if you were different?
Has Susie? Has anyone here?

01:16:01.375 --> 01:16:03.343
No.

01:16:03.410 --> 01:16:05.344
You've been wonderful,
but...

01:16:05.412 --> 01:16:08.347
Then don't ever do this
to us again.

Mama?

01:16:36.009 --> 01:16:37.943
Oh, please.

01:16:39.346 --> 01:16:41.280
Try to understand.

01:16:42.516 --> 01:16:45.610

to hurt you.

Oh, I know, baby.

01:16:50.357 --> 01:16:54.487
You're just like
a puppy that's been
cooped up too much.

01:16:55.662 --> 01:16:59.598
That's why I wanted you
to go to the party.

01:17:01.034 --> 01:17:03.468
Oh, Mama.

01:17:03.537 --> 01:17:05.971

Frankie, you're late.

I thought
you'd never get here.

01:17:50.352 --> 01:17:53.287
Let's walk down
by the river.

01:17:53.355 --> 01:17:55.448
I wanna talk to you.

01:17:55.524 --> 01:17:57.458
We can talk here.

trouble at home.

01:18:02.398 --> 01:18:05.299
Your mother?
Yes.

01:18:05.367 --> 01:18:10.134
Frankie, you said
you wanted to take
a job in Jersey.

01:18:10.206 --> 01:18:12.106
Couldn't we run away?

01:18:12.174 --> 01:18:15.575
I'd do anything
to be with you,
anything.

01:18:15.644 --> 01:18:18.078
That's not a bad idea.

01:18:18.147 --> 01:18:21.082
That's not
a bad idea at all.

01:18:21.150 --> 01:18:23.243
Just tell me
one thing.
Yes?

01:18:23.319 --> 01:18:25.253
Is it true?

01:18:25.321 --> 01:18:27.255
Is what true?

01:18:27.323 --> 01:18:29.757
Is your mother
a nigger?

01:18:29.825 --> 01:18:32.089
Tell me.

01:18:32.161 --> 01:18:34.595
Tell me!
What difference
does it make?
You love me!

All the kids talking
behind my back!
Is it true?

01:18:37.666 --> 01:18:39.600
No!
Are you black?

You're lying!

And I'm glad
the guests have gone.

01:19:25.347 --> 01:19:28.282
I'm glad you're not
going to Italy.
So am I.

01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:31.285
Felluci wanted me
in Rome in one week.

01:19:31.353 --> 01:19:34.789
But I won't miss
Susie's graduation,
not for anything.

01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:36.916
You know,
I can't believe it.

01:19:36.992 --> 01:19:39.927
Susie and Sarah Jane
all grown up.

You and I have gone
through a lot together,
haven't we?

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.436
The years are flyin'.
I'm getting old.

01:19:48.504 --> 01:19:51.871
You never sounded
so solemn before.

01:19:51.940 --> 01:19:56.001
Don't you feel well,
Annie?
Oh, just
a little tired.

01:19:56.078 --> 01:19:59.013
Well, do you need anything?
Any money?

01:19:59.081 --> 01:20:02.016
No, Miss Lora.
Thanks to you,
I'm well fixed.

01:20:02.084 --> 01:20:05.019
I've plenty to send
Sarah Jane to college,

01:20:05.087 --> 01:20:09.023
something set aside for her,
and enough for my funeral.
Oh, Annie.

01:20:09.091 --> 01:20:11.525
That funeral again.
Well, I'm gettin' on.

01:20:11.593 --> 01:20:14.528
That's the one thing
I've always wanted
to splurge on.

01:20:14.596 --> 01:20:16.530
I really want it elegant.

01:20:16.598 --> 01:20:21.535
Got it written down the way I
want it to be, all the friends
I'd like to have there.

01:20:21.603 --> 01:20:24.538
It never occurred to me
that you had many friends.

01:20:24.606 --> 01:20:29.043
You never have any visit you.
I know lots of people.
Oh, hundreds.

01:20:29.111 --> 01:20:32.046
Really?
I belong to
the baptist church.

01:20:32.114 --> 01:20:36.312
And I belong
to several lodges too.
I didn't know.

Miss Lora,
you never asked.

01:20:40.622 --> 01:20:43.056

It's Sarah Jane!

01:20:43.125 --> 01:20:45.059
Oh!

Sarah Jane!
Oh, my baby!

01:20:54.002 --> 01:20:57.199
Get some water and towels.
What happened, baby?
What happened?

01:20:57.271 --> 01:21:00.297
Leave me alone.
Honey, who did this
to you?

01:21:00.375 --> 01:21:02.309
Tell me!
Leave me alone!

01:21:02.377 --> 01:21:04.311
You've got to
tell me!
Who was it?

01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:09.181
It was her boyfriend.
Boyfriend?

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:12.777
Yes. He found out
I'm not white,

01:21:12.854 --> 01:21:15.846
because you keep telling
the world I'm your daughter.

01:21:15.923 --> 01:21:18.619
Anything you can spoil,
you spoil!

01:21:18.693 --> 01:21:21.059
Stop that.
Stop it!

01:21:21.129 --> 01:21:23.222
Don't you talk
to your mother like that.

01:21:23.297 --> 01:21:26.733
I told you.
Lies don't help none.

01:21:26.801 --> 01:21:28.735
This always happens
when you lie.

01:21:28.803 --> 01:21:31.237
It wouldn't if you
weren't always around!

Are you sure Annie
will make it in time?
Honey, you know Annie.

01:21:43.484 --> 01:21:45.952
If she says she will,
she will.

I'm only sorry I couldn't
bring your present with me,

01:22:00.101 --> 01:22:02.035
He? Who's he?
Who's too big?

Yeah?

Well, he's waiting
for you at home.
You mean he's mine?

Steve, you're such
a darling to come.

I meant it when I said
I wouldn't miss it for the...
Lora!

Hello, Steve.
I thought you were
in Italy.

01:22:41.742 --> 01:22:44.734
Annie, why didn't
you tell me?
Slipped my mind, I'm afraid.

01:22:44.812 --> 01:22:47.007
This came for you
this mornin'.
Oh.

01:22:47.081 --> 01:22:49.515
Honey, Sarah Jane's
much better.
I'm glad.

01:22:49.584 --> 01:22:52.018
She's sorry
she couldn't come,
but she sends her love.

This is the most exciting
day of my entire life.

Oh, it's...
It's from Felluci.

01:23:00.595 --> 01:23:04.031
He still wants me
for the part, and he'll
wait after all.

Oh! At least that time
will be ours together.

01:23:14.675 --> 01:23:18.611
Oh, don't look like that.
Felluci agreed to my terms.

01:23:18.679 --> 01:23:22.274
I can't turn him down now.
I know, Mother,
I know.

Look, honey, your mama
feels worse than you.

be able to get away now.
Oh.

Would you do me a favor?

Will you look after my child

on both sides.

borrow one of Mother's.
Steve's seen all of mine.

Sarah Jane bought
herself a new one.
You can wear hers.

Oh, yes.
Thank you.

The Head Librarian
thinks she's so good,

01:27:54.187 --> 01:27:57.452
why, she even gave her
a raise.
<i>That's wonderful! </i>

01:27:57.524 --> 01:28:02.120
She just wrote me the other
day and she said that...

Hello?
Is this the Manhattan

[Man] Yes, it is.
May I speak to Miss
Sarah Jane Johnson, please?

I'm sorry.
The library's closed.

You have no one there
by that name?
No.

01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:47.569
Are you sure?
Absolutely sure?

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:50.234
Yes, I'm sure.
No one.

01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:52.471
I see.

01:28:52.545 --> 01:28:55.605
Well, thank you very much.

It's her life and I'm done

anything, I can help her.

01:41:36.708 --> 01:41:39.302
That wasn't all I wanted,
honey.

01:41:39.377 --> 01:41:41.572
That was only part of it.

01:41:41.646 --> 01:41:43.637
What's the rest?

01:41:43.715 --> 01:41:46.548
I'd like to hold you
in my arms once more...

01:41:46.618 --> 01:41:48.552
like you were
still my baby.

01:41:49.921 --> 01:41:52.913
All right, Mama.
All right.

01:41:52.991 --> 01:41:55.221
Oh, Sarah Jane.

01:41:55.293 --> 01:41:57.727
[Crying]
Oh, my baby!

01:41:59.130 --> 01:42:02.065
My beautiful,
beautiful baby!

01:42:02.133 --> 01:42:04.658
Oh!
[Continues Crying]

01:42:04.736 --> 01:42:09.139
I love you so much.
Nothin' you ever do
can stop that.

01:42:09.207 --> 01:42:11.698
Oh, Mama!

01:42:11.776 --> 01:42:15.212
Oh, my baby.
Mama. Mama.

01:42:16.548 --> 01:42:19.039
Oh, my baby.

<i>[Knock On Door]</i>

01:42:21.119 --> 01:42:24.714
[Sniffling]
Come on, Linda,
they're waiting.

01:42:26.925 --> 01:42:30.952
Listen, if you're the new maid,
I want to report that my shower
is full of ants.

01:42:31.029 --> 01:42:34.897
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.
That must be very uncomfortable.

01:42:34.966 --> 01:42:39.403
But I just happened to be
in town and dropped in
to see Miss Linda.

01:42:39.471 --> 01:42:41.735
I used to take care of her.

01:42:43.341 --> 01:42:47.607
Well, I guess I'll
be running along.

01:42:47.679 --> 01:42:51.115
My plane's leaving
in a little while,
Miss Linda.

01:42:53.351 --> 01:42:56.320
[Whispering]
Good-bye, honey.

01:42:56.388 --> 01:42:59.846
You take good care
of yourself.

01:42:59.925 --> 01:43:02.086
Good-bye.

01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:04.094
[Whispers]
Mama.

01:43:09.601 --> 01:43:12.297
Well! Get you.

01:43:12.370 --> 01:43:16.204
[Southern Accent]
So, honey child,
you had a mammy.

01:43:16.274 --> 01:43:18.208
Yes.

01:43:19.444 --> 01:43:21.378
All my life.

01:43:31.451 --> 01:43:33.510
Hello, Steve.

01:43:33.587 --> 01:43:35.521
Hello, Lora.

01:43:37.024 --> 01:43:39.788
Some of my girlfriends
get embarrassed
when their mothers...

01:43:39.860 --> 01:43:42.454
wear shorts or capri pants,
things like that.

01:43:42.529 --> 01:43:45.589
I really don't mind.
[Giggling]
That's very big of you.

01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:49.067
I mixed you a highball,
but you only get one
before lunch.

01:43:49.136 --> 01:43:51.798
Yes, ma'am.
I just had a call
from Loomis.

01:43:51.872 --> 01:43:55.137
Don't say a word.
He's got a new role for you.
No, no.

01:43:55.208 --> 01:43:57.142
<i>Highball? </i>
Yes.

01:43:57.210 --> 01:43:59.576
No, they've flown over a print
of the Italian picture.

01:43:59.646 --> 01:44:03.480
He's arranged
a special showing tonight,
and a party afterwards.

01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:05.745
Darling, I'd like you
to see it too,

01:44:05.819 --> 01:44:08.151
but I'm worried
about Annie.

01:44:08.221 --> 01:44:11.315
Ever since she came
back from Los Angeles,
she's changed.

01:44:11.391 --> 01:44:14.690
Dr. Miller's quite concerned
about her condition.

01:44:14.761 --> 01:44:18.697
I think someone should stay
in the house with her tonight.
Do you mind?

01:44:18.765 --> 01:44:21.825
No, of course not, Mama.
I'll see you tomorrow, Steve?

01:44:21.902 --> 01:44:24.496
Sure.

01:44:24.571 --> 01:44:27.506
What can we do
to help Annie, Steve?

01:44:27.574 --> 01:44:31.101
There's no answer, Lora,
never has been.

01:44:31.178 --> 01:44:33.112
Not for a broken heart.

01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:35.614
Mmm, and I know Mother
didn't understand.

01:44:35.682 --> 01:44:38.048
Oh, it was so embarrassing.
And poor Steve.

01:44:38.118 --> 01:44:41.713
I mean, what could he do?
She just swept over him
like a tidal wave.

01:44:41.788 --> 01:44:45.815
Honey, it's only natural
he'd like to go out
with your mother.

01:44:45.892 --> 01:44:49.555
He always enjoyed her company.
You remember that.

01:44:49.630 --> 01:44:51.598
But it's different now.

01:44:51.665 --> 01:44:53.860
All summer long
it's been Steve and me.

01:44:55.135 --> 01:44:58.730
- Annie, you know, don't you?
- Know what?

01:44:58.805 --> 01:45:03.674
That I'm in love with Steve.
I've always been in love
with him and always will be.

01:45:03.744 --> 01:45:06.406
Sure, Susie,

01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.812
but like a little girl.

01:45:08.882 --> 01:45:12.113
<i>No. I don't think</i>
<i>it even started like that. </i>

01:45:12.185 --> 01:45:15.416
In a funny way,
I always knew.

01:45:15.489 --> 01:45:19.425
Every time I thought
I liked a boy, it was because
he reminded me of Steve.

01:45:19.493 --> 01:45:23.020
And then I'd stop
liking him because...

01:45:23.096 --> 01:45:25.189
Because he wasn't Steve.

01:46:41.108 --> 01:46:43.042
[Knocking]

01:46:44.911 --> 01:46:47.539
Susie?
Are you up, darling?

01:46:47.614 --> 01:46:49.673
<i>Yes. </i>

01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:53.277
I just had to tell you.
I have the most wonderful news.

01:46:53.353 --> 01:46:56.220
You're going to do
another picture.
No.

01:46:56.289 --> 01:47:00.453
Not a picture,
not a play,
never again.

01:47:00.527 --> 01:47:04.554
Oh, I know you
don't believe me.
I can't blame you.

01:47:04.631 --> 01:47:08.260
Steve didn't either.
He probably won't until
our tenth anniversary.

01:47:09.836 --> 01:47:11.770
A-Anniversary?

01:47:11.838 --> 01:47:15.239
Oh, Steve and I have
always been in love.

01:47:15.308 --> 01:47:19.711
But it seems I've never
had time for anything
but my work.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:23.807
So I just up and proposed
that we get married.

01:47:25.619 --> 01:47:29.180
<i>Well, Susie, </i>
<i>what's the matter? </i>
<i>Are you all right? </i>

01:47:29.256 --> 01:47:32.919
Yes, I'm fine.
I hope you'll be very happy.

01:47:32.993 --> 01:47:35.826
Oh, we will be,
all of us.

01:47:37.831 --> 01:47:40.493
What is it, darling?
Tell me.

01:47:40.567 --> 01:47:43.001
I'm very tired.
Good night, Mother.

01:47:45.572 --> 01:47:47.506
Good night, dear.

01:47:56.950 --> 01:47:58.884
[Sobs]

01:48:06.226 --> 01:48:10.629
You know, Annie,
last night when I told
Susie the news,

01:48:12.132 --> 01:48:14.464
she was like ice.

01:48:14.534 --> 01:48:18.402
It's strange.
l... I thought she
would be ecstatic.

01:48:20.907 --> 01:48:24.468
She always seemed to...
To adore Steve.

01:48:28.114 --> 01:48:31.515
Something's wrong
with her, Annie.

01:48:31.585 --> 01:48:33.519
Do you know what it is?

01:48:35.355 --> 01:48:40.657
Miss Lora, you've got
to be very careful
the way you handle Susie.

01:48:40.727 --> 01:48:43.662
She's got
a real problem.
Problem?

01:48:43.730 --> 01:48:47.166
Why don't I know about it?
Why didn't she come to me?

01:48:47.234 --> 01:48:49.828
Maybe because
you weren't around.

01:48:51.171 --> 01:48:53.867
You mean, l...

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:55.874
I haven't been
a good mother.

01:48:55.942 --> 01:48:58.843
I know you meant
to be a good mother,

01:48:58.912 --> 01:49:01.142
the best kind of mother,

01:49:01.214 --> 01:49:05.947
but look, I meant to
be a good one too,
and I failed.

01:49:06.019 --> 01:49:09.386
But you couldn't have been
a better mother to Sarah Jane.

01:49:09.456 --> 01:49:13.722
- Then where's
my little girl?
- But Annie, that's different.

01:49:13.793 --> 01:49:16.125
Hers is
a very real problem.

01:49:16.196 --> 01:49:18.221
What's complicated
Susie's life?

01:49:18.298 --> 01:49:21.631
We made a home for her;
the prettiest clothes;
the best schools.

01:49:21.701 --> 01:49:25.728
- Susie's in love.
- Oh, Annie.

01:49:25.805 --> 01:49:28.740
Is that all?
Why didn't you say so?

01:49:28.808 --> 01:49:31.936
<i>It's not unusual for a girl</i>
<i>Susie's age to be in love. </i>

01:49:32.012 --> 01:49:35.504
It's who she's in love with
that's causing all the trouble.

01:49:35.582 --> 01:49:39.211
Why? Who is it?

01:49:40.287 --> 01:49:42.221
Mr. Steve.

01:49:44.257 --> 01:49:46.748
What?

01:49:46.826 --> 01:49:49.260
That's impossible.

01:49:49.329 --> 01:49:52.093
How did it happen?
Why did he let it happen?

01:49:52.165 --> 01:49:54.429
I don't think he knows.

01:49:54.501 --> 01:49:56.901
Annie, it can't
be serious!

01:49:56.970 --> 01:49:59.996
It is, Miss Lora.
Plenty serious.

01:50:00.073 --> 01:50:03.008
I better have a talk
with Susie right now.

01:50:03.076 --> 01:50:05.169
Wait, wait.
<i>[Door Closes]</i>

01:50:05.245 --> 01:50:08.339
<i>[Door Opens]</i>

01:50:08.415 --> 01:50:10.542
Susie.

01:50:10.617 --> 01:50:12.744
I've just spoken
to Annie.
Have you?

01:50:12.819 --> 01:50:16.152
Now I know why you were
so upset last night.
So Annie told you.

01:50:16.222 --> 01:50:19.714
That's how you usually
find things out about me.
That's not true!

01:50:19.793 --> 01:50:22.660
Let's face it, Mama.
Annie's always been more
like a real mother.

01:50:22.729 --> 01:50:26.187
You never had time for me.
By the way, is this
worded correctly?

01:50:29.502 --> 01:50:32.164
An application
to college?
Uh-huh.

01:50:32.238 --> 01:50:34.729
But you're going
to study in New York.

01:50:34.808 --> 01:50:37.106
Denver...
It's 1,500 miles away.

01:50:37.177 --> 01:50:39.338
1,628, to be exact.
That's quite a distance.

01:50:39.412 --> 01:50:42.609
I don't think
I'll be missed.
Don't be unfair, Susie.

01:50:42.682 --> 01:50:45.515
You know I'd miss you.
I'm sure you'd be too busy
to miss anyone.

01:50:45.585 --> 01:50:47.576
Much too busy.

01:50:47.654 --> 01:50:49.918
You give me credit
for nothing.

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:52.788
Yes, I'm ambitious,
perhaps too ambitious,

01:50:52.859 --> 01:50:55.350
but it's been for your sake
as well as mine.

01:50:55.428 --> 01:50:58.363
Isn't this house
just a little bit nicer
than a cold-water flat?

01:50:58.431 --> 01:51:00.865
And your new horse.
Aren't you crazy about it?
Yes, but l...

01:51:00.934 --> 01:51:04.131
And that closet of yours...
Has all the dresses fit for
the daughter of a famous star.

01:51:04.204 --> 01:51:06.138
Now, just a moment,
young lady.

01:51:06.206 --> 01:51:09.471
It's only because
of my ambition that you've
had the best of everything.

01:51:09.542 --> 01:51:12.773
That's a solid achievement
that any mother can be proud of.

01:51:12.846 --> 01:51:14.780
How about a mother's love?

01:51:14.848 --> 01:51:18.045
Love? But you've
always had that!

01:51:18.118 --> 01:51:20.814
Yes, by telephone, postcard,
magazine interviews.

01:51:20.887 --> 01:51:24.050
You've given me everything
but yourself.

01:51:24.124 --> 01:51:28.788
No wonder I went to Annie
last night when I told her
about Steve.

01:51:28.862 --> 01:51:30.796
Oh, Susie.

01:51:33.967 --> 01:51:36.401
If Steve is going
to come between us,

01:51:38.705 --> 01:51:40.900
I'll give him up.

01:51:40.974 --> 01:51:43.135
I'll never see him again.

01:51:43.209 --> 01:51:45.905
Oh, Mama, stop acting!

01:51:45.979 --> 01:51:49.346
Stop trying to shift people
around as if they were pawns
on a stage.

01:51:49.416 --> 01:51:51.850
But, Susie, l...
Don't worry,
I'll get over Steve,

01:51:51.918 --> 01:51:54.352
but please,
don't play the martyr.

01:51:59.025 --> 01:52:03.462
Oh, Mama, I'm sorry.
I didn't want to hurt you.

01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:07.364
But last night
I was so unhappy!
[Sobbing]

01:52:08.935 --> 01:52:10.869
Oh, darling.

01:52:12.505 --> 01:52:15.338
l... I don't know.

01:52:15.408 --> 01:52:18.036
Maybe it was all
to the good because...

01:52:18.111 --> 01:52:22.047
this morning I felt
strangely independent and...

01:52:22.115 --> 01:52:24.549
Well, I like the feeling.

01:52:24.617 --> 01:52:27.609
That's why I think I'd...
I'd like to go away,

01:52:27.687 --> 01:52:29.746
at least for a while.

01:52:29.823 --> 01:52:32.485
Oh, Mama, please try
to understand.

01:52:32.559 --> 01:52:34.493
I'm very sincere
about it.

01:52:38.298 --> 01:52:41.233
Ah, it's funny
the way things turn out.

01:52:46.305 --> 01:52:48.239
Thank you.

01:52:54.747 --> 01:52:57.682
I still can't get over Susie
at the station yesterday.

01:52:57.750 --> 01:53:01.379
She looked so... grown-up
when she said good-bye.

01:53:01.453 --> 01:53:03.387
Yes, she did.

01:53:06.759 --> 01:53:10.195
It does seem awfully
quiet here without her.

01:53:10.262 --> 01:53:12.628
Annie and I were talking
about that last night.

01:53:12.698 --> 01:53:17.101
With both the girls gone,
we felt so alone
in this big house.

01:53:17.169 --> 01:53:19.797
When did this idea
of college come up?

01:53:19.872 --> 01:53:22.306
Susie never once
mentioned it to me.

01:53:22.374 --> 01:53:25.366
She decided suddenly.

01:53:25.444 --> 01:53:28.470
And why Colorado?
So far away.

01:53:28.547 --> 01:53:31.209
It's what she wanted.

01:53:31.283 --> 01:53:34.218
Miss Meredith, it's Annie.
She's terribly sick.

01:53:34.286 --> 01:53:36.880
Did you call
the doctor?
Yes, he'll
be right over.

01:53:36.955 --> 01:53:39.150
And she wants
the minister too.

01:53:47.132 --> 01:53:49.066

I hate to dispute you,

Oh, Annie, don't talk.

01:54:10.356 --> 01:54:13.018
<i>I've got to talk. </i>
<i>I've got to. </i>
Oh, please.

01:54:13.092 --> 01:54:15.026
Please, not now.

01:54:15.094 --> 01:54:17.028
You stop crying.
But l...

01:54:17.096 --> 01:54:20.862
No, listen to me.
All right.
I'm listening.

01:54:20.933 --> 01:54:23.993
When my bills
are all paid,

01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:27.436
I want everything
that's left to go to...

01:54:27.506 --> 01:54:30.031
Sarah Jane.
Of course.

01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:34.045
Mr. Steve?
<i>Yes, Annie? </i>

01:54:34.113 --> 01:54:37.742
[Breathing Hard]
Find her, Mr. Steve.
Find her.

01:54:37.816 --> 01:54:40.478
I will.
You may be sure.

01:54:40.552 --> 01:54:43.282
<i>I will. </i>
Thank you.

01:54:43.355 --> 01:54:46.256
Miss Lora,
just tell her...

01:54:46.325 --> 01:54:49.726
Tell her I know
I was selfish,

01:54:49.795 --> 01:54:53.492
and if I loved her too much,
I'm sorry.

01:54:54.800 --> 01:54:57.496
But I didn't mean
to cause her any trouble.

01:54:57.569 --> 01:54:59.503
She was all I had.

01:54:59.571 --> 01:55:02.233
<i>Tell her, Miss Lora. </i>
Oh, please, Annie!

01:55:02.307 --> 01:55:05.743
Promise me?
Promise me?
I promise.

01:55:05.811 --> 01:55:08.177
Ohh.

01:55:08.247 --> 01:55:11.080
<i>My pearl necklace. </i>
Yes?

01:55:12.418 --> 01:55:15.319
I want you to give it
to Susie...

01:55:15.387 --> 01:55:17.321
for her weddin'.

01:55:18.624 --> 01:55:21.593
Give her a real
bridey wedding...

01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:23.594
with all the fixin's.

01:55:24.930 --> 01:55:28.024
Our weddin' day...

01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:31.866
and the day we die...

01:55:31.937 --> 01:55:33.871
are the great events...

01:55:35.174 --> 01:55:37.267
of life.

01:55:38.377 --> 01:55:40.311
[Sobbing]
Oh, Annie!

01:55:40.379 --> 01:55:42.506
Annie, darling.

01:55:42.581 --> 01:55:45.846
[Sobbing Continues]
There's no cause to cry.

01:55:45.918 --> 01:55:47.818
- Reverend?
- Yes, Annie?

01:55:51.390 --> 01:55:55.986
I'd like for your wife
to have my fur scarf.

01:55:56.061 --> 01:55:59.724
She always admired
that fur.

01:55:59.798 --> 01:56:04.531
She never believed me when
I said it was genuine mink.

01:56:04.603 --> 01:56:07.333
She did, Annie,
she did.

01:56:07.406 --> 01:56:09.772
Oh, please,
you don't have to...

01:56:09.842 --> 01:56:12.037
And I want Mr. McKinney...

01:56:12.110 --> 01:56:15.944
to have a nice, clean
50-dollar bill.

01:56:16.014 --> 01:56:18.312
M-Mr. McKinney?

01:56:18.383 --> 01:56:22.444
The milkman at the old
cold-water flat.
Oh.

01:56:22.521 --> 01:56:26.617
He was so nice
and understanding
about the bill.

01:56:26.692 --> 01:56:29.718
I always send him
a little something
at Christmas time,

01:56:29.795 --> 01:56:31.729
in both our names.

01:56:33.765 --> 01:56:36.233
You've been so good.

01:56:36.301 --> 01:56:39.498
Sure hope you're right,
Miss Lora.

01:56:39.571 --> 01:56:42.563
I'd like to be standin'
with the lambs...

01:56:42.641 --> 01:56:44.632
and not with the goats...

01:56:44.710 --> 01:56:46.575
on judgment day.

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:51.013
And my funeral...

01:56:51.083 --> 01:56:53.779
Mr. Steve,

01:56:53.852 --> 01:56:58.312
you'll find what I want
in the drawer...

01:56:58.390 --> 01:57:00.324
over there.

01:57:05.998 --> 01:57:07.932
I've got it, Annie.

01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:10.662
I want to go...

01:57:10.736 --> 01:57:13.569
the way I planned,

01:57:13.639 --> 01:57:17.200
especially
the four white horses...

01:57:17.276 --> 01:57:20.211
and a band playin'.

01:57:20.279 --> 01:57:22.577
No mourning,

01:57:22.648 --> 01:57:26.550
but proud
and high-steppin',

01:57:27.686 --> 01:57:29.916
like I was goin'
to glory.

01:57:29.988 --> 01:57:32.821
No. I won't listen.

01:57:32.891 --> 01:57:36.383
There isn't going
to be any funeral,
not for a long, long time.

01:57:36.461 --> 01:57:39.430
You can't leave me.
I won't let you.

01:57:40.933 --> 01:57:43.401
I'm just tired, Miss Lora.

01:57:45.470 --> 01:57:49.167
Awfully... tired.

01:57:53.412 --> 01:57:55.505
Annie!

01:57:55.581 --> 01:57:58.516
Annie!
