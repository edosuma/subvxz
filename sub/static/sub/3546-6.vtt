WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.150
Previously on
"Desperate Housewives"...

00:03.174 --> 00:04.761
My husband died
thinking that I murdered him.

00:04.785 --> 00:07.014
Bree put the past behind her.

00:07.038 --> 00:09.086
You keep me on as your lawyer,
your wife's off-limits.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.317
He's my lawyer.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.419
While Carlos gambled
with his future...

00:12.443 --> 00:14.670
How much money do you think
you'll need to get to Utah?

00:14.693 --> 00:16.023
Susan interfered

00:16.047 --> 00:18.187
with a family reunion.

00:20.521 --> 00:25.032
George Williams
had never been lucky in love.

00:25.056 --> 00:27.034
It seemed that the women
he dated

00:27.058 --> 00:32.179
always invented reasons not to
consummate their relationship.

00:32.203 --> 00:36.713
Um, I'm afraid
we'd wake my roommate.

00:38.739 --> 00:44.020
Uh, I have to get up
really early for work.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.595
I'm, uh, saving myself...

00:48.619 --> 00:51.158
For... marriage.

00:52.383 --> 00:54.361
Sadly for George,

00:54.385 --> 00:59.106
it was one unoriginal excuse
after another.

01:00.461 --> 01:04.671
But since he'd starting
seeing Bree Van De Kamp,

01:04.694 --> 01:07.144
George couldn't help but feel...

01:07.168 --> 01:09.146
Hi. The kids are gone.

01:09.170 --> 01:12.149
We have the house
all to ourselves tonight.

01:12.173 --> 01:16.083
His luck was about to change.

01:16.107 --> 01:18.255
I thought the duck
turned out well,

01:18.279 --> 01:20.257
although the sauce
was a little bit thick.

01:20.281 --> 01:22.759
But judging by how many helpings
you had,

01:22.783 --> 01:24.793
I think I got away with it.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.235
Mmm.

01:28.259 --> 01:29.766
Mmm.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.638
What are you thinking about?

01:31.662 --> 01:33.092
Your hair.

01:36.527 --> 01:38.645
Would you mind if I...

01:38.669 --> 01:41.569
Uh, no. Go ahead.

01:48.279 --> 01:50.179
Is that better?

02:03.294 --> 02:05.504
That was nice.

02:10.401 --> 02:13.680
It's okay
that I'm doing this, right?

02:13.704 --> 02:16.691
Well, I thought we were gonna
let the duck digest a bit more,

02:16.715 --> 02:18.415
but what the heck?

02:20.771 --> 02:21.748
Oh!

02:21.772 --> 02:22.849
What's wrong?

02:22.873 --> 02:24.796
I don't know.
I felt something weird.

02:24.820 --> 02:28.255
Oh, that was my tongue.
It extends farther than most.

02:28.279 --> 02:31.127
I should have warned you. No,
no, no, it wasn't your kiss.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.400
I felt something weird
on my neck.

02:36.887 --> 02:38.365
Wh-what are you doing?

02:38.389 --> 02:40.867
I don't know. I'm just
really starting to itch.

02:40.891 --> 02:43.431
Oh.

02:44.635 --> 02:46.213
What is it?

02:46.237 --> 02:48.837
Y-You've got a huge rash.

02:56.807 --> 02:58.785
It's starting to spread
to my face.

02:58.809 --> 03:01.188
Are you allergic
to something you ate?

03:01.212 --> 03:03.260
Oh, I don't think so.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.871
I mean, I've made duck I'orange
a thousand times.

03:05.895 --> 03:08.235
Something is causing that rash.

03:08.259 --> 03:09.796
Bree, Bree, please don't.

03:09.820 --> 03:12.299
I'm sorry, George,
but you have to go.

03:12.323 --> 03:13.800
But the kids are away.

03:13.824 --> 03:15.907
I was sort of hoping
we could make love tonight.

03:15.931 --> 03:17.904
How are we gonna do that,
George?

03:17.928 --> 03:20.247
You have just given me hives.

03:21.532 --> 03:23.210
Though painful to hear,

03:23.234 --> 03:24.521
George had to admit,

03:24.545 --> 03:28.255
at least this excuse
was original.

03:28.279 --> 03:36.279
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

04:11.682 --> 04:17.303
It's a fact that little girls
dream of big white weddings.

04:17.327 --> 04:22.969
Of course, the exact same thing
can be said for big girls,

04:22.993 --> 04:27.344
some of whom
can get incredibly anxious

04:27.368 --> 04:30.016
waiting for the boys
in their lives

04:30.040 --> 04:33.550
to make those dreams come true.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.522
Aah! Oh. Watch it, susie.

04:35.546 --> 04:38.024
Mom, why don't you just
go see a dressmaker?

04:38.048 --> 04:40.457
Wait. I have the perfect idea.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.560
You get in the dress,
and I'll pin it.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.562
We wear the same size.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.863
Since when?

04:46.887 --> 04:49.536
Since forever.

04:49.560 --> 04:52.038
You have to leave, though.
You can't stay.

04:52.062 --> 04:54.040
You can't see susie
in a wedding dress,

04:54.064 --> 04:56.042
not untilyourbig day.

04:56.066 --> 04:59.045
Mom! No, it's not a problem.

04:59.069 --> 05:00.807
I can see her in it.

05:00.831 --> 05:01.808
You can?

05:01.832 --> 05:03.310
You can?

05:03.334 --> 05:05.921
I assume you wanna pick out
your own wedding dress

05:05.945 --> 05:07.914
when we get married, right?

05:07.938 --> 05:10.286
That sounds like
a proposal.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.458
Did it?

05:11.482 --> 05:12.759
Yeah, it did.

05:12.783 --> 05:14.761
Huh. What do you know?

05:14.785 --> 05:17.324
Are you planning
to pop the question?

05:17.348 --> 05:19.326
Well, if she knows it's coming,

05:19.350 --> 05:21.768
the question won't really pop,
now will it?

05:21.792 --> 05:24.776
He's right, mom. I want it
to be just like you do...

05:24.800 --> 05:26.603
You know, on your own terms,

05:26.627 --> 05:29.906
and you get down on one knee and
the whole production. That's the plan.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.908
Well, then I can wait.
I can wait.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.611
I'm a good waiter. Good.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.843
I'm just wondering if there's
a ballpark of how long

05:36.867 --> 05:39.686
I will have to wait...
A week, a month, after lunch?

05:39.710 --> 05:42.349
Again, you're not waiting
for the pop.

05:42.373 --> 05:44.351
Right, right. I'm sorry.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.022
Yay!

05:46.046 --> 05:48.955
Oh, mom.

05:48.979 --> 05:52.929
So the hives occurred
right after you kissed George?

05:52.953 --> 05:55.932
Yes. It was the strangest thing,

05:55.956 --> 05:58.835
and so inconvenient.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.407
To be honest,

06:00.431 --> 06:03.540
I think we were about to
make love for the first time.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.547
Bree, have you considered
the idea

06:05.571 --> 06:07.343
that your subconscious mind

06:07.367 --> 06:09.376
was trying to sabotage
your evening with George?

06:09.400 --> 06:11.378
Actually,
I have not considered that

06:11.402 --> 06:13.880
because that's idiotic.

06:13.904 --> 06:15.887
You don't think being
with George

06:15.911 --> 06:18.425
made you feel a bit guilty?
Why should I feel guilty?

06:18.449 --> 06:21.027
Perhaps you felt you were
about to commit adultery.

06:21.051 --> 06:25.591
Dr. Goldfine, Rex is dead.
You can't cheat on a corpse.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.897
Well, maybe that's not how
you really feel deep down.

06:30.921 --> 06:33.570
Oh, so you think I'm crazy?

06:33.594 --> 06:36.408
You say you got
a case of hives for no reason.

06:36.432 --> 06:38.104
I think there is a reason,

06:38.128 --> 06:40.447
and it's probably
a psychosomatic one.

06:40.471 --> 06:41.908
You can think whatever you want,

06:41.932 --> 06:44.416
but to be honest, I don't
believe in the subconscious.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.813
Every time you've said "Rex"
in this session,

06:46.837 --> 06:49.816
you've stroked the place where
your wedding ring used to be.

06:49.840 --> 06:52.040
Why did you do that?

06:56.487 --> 06:57.564
Let's talk about Monday.

06:57.588 --> 06:59.796
We are re-pitching
to the kamarov people.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.068
Lynette, you'll be on point.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.530
Great. Great. No problem.

07:03.554 --> 07:05.532
And can you do me a favor

07:05.556 --> 07:07.874
and maybenotwear the green suit?

07:07.898 --> 07:09.576
Um...

07:09.600 --> 07:14.711
I... wasn't planning to,
uh, but... why?

07:14.735 --> 07:17.684
The fabric. It just has
this quality to it,

07:17.708 --> 07:20.046
like you could... I don't know...

07:20.070 --> 07:23.750
Wipe it clean with a damp cloth.

07:23.774 --> 07:25.761
I'll just wear
a different suit, then.

07:25.785 --> 07:27.724
Great.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.996
Like what, you think?

07:30.020 --> 07:32.459
Another suit.
I have other suits.

07:32.483 --> 07:34.910
And if by other suits,
you mean the gray one,

07:34.934 --> 07:37.704
then of course you do.

07:37.728 --> 07:40.106
No, actually,
I have quite a few others.

07:40.130 --> 07:42.669
Uh, the blue one

07:42.693 --> 07:44.611
and, uh...

07:44.635 --> 07:46.673
What's wrong with the blue suit?

07:46.697 --> 07:48.875
Stu, would you like
to tell Lynette

07:48.899 --> 07:50.999
what's wrong with the blue suit?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.681
No. That's cool.

07:54.705 --> 07:56.853
Stu... come on.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.555
Do the thing...

07:58.579 --> 08:00.687
The thing that you did at lunch.

08:00.711 --> 08:03.089
"Look at me. I'm Lynette."

08:03.113 --> 08:06.563
"I've got food stains
everywhere."

08:06.587 --> 08:09.566
All right. So if I get
my blue suit dry-cleaned,

08:09.590 --> 08:11.638
will that be acceptable
to everyone?

08:11.662 --> 08:15.602
The pants also have
a split seam in the back.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.610
Excuse me.

08:24.635 --> 08:26.152
Hello, David.

08:26.176 --> 08:28.154
What the hell is this?

08:28.178 --> 08:30.156
I thought I told you
to dress maternal.

08:30.180 --> 08:33.159
Yes, you did, and I considered
it for about a second.

08:33.183 --> 08:34.220
What happened?

08:34.244 --> 08:36.227
David, I know you're
the lawyer and all,

08:36.251 --> 08:38.995
but trust me, it's never a smart
strategy to cover this up.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.996
We've got 40 minutes
before the pre-trial hearing.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.999
Let's go home
and get you changed.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.006
What? You want to get
your husband out of jail?

08:45.030 --> 08:47.503
You gotta dress like
a pregnant, suffering wife,

08:47.527 --> 08:50.537
not the cover of "vogue." David.

08:50.561 --> 08:52.539
Louis, what are you doing
here? I need a favor, David.

08:52.563 --> 08:55.687
If this has to do with lifting
my client's restraining order,

08:55.711 --> 08:57.684
the answer's the same one
you got last week.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.185
You don't understand.
I love crystal.

08:59.209 --> 09:02.088
Yeah, we all love the pretty
ladies at the stop n' shop,

09:02.112 --> 09:04.596
but now you've gotta love her
from 50 yards away.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.624
You turned her against me.
If it wasn't for you,

09:07.648 --> 09:09.756
we'd be together.
Louis, crystal hired me

09:09.780 --> 09:12.699
to keep you away from her.
She doesn'twantto see you.

09:12.723 --> 09:14.936
Oh, yeah, then why did
she ask for my phone number?

09:14.960 --> 09:16.733
She's a cashier.
You paid by check.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.735
It doesn't make you special.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.638
Don't walk away from me.
We're having a conversation!

09:21.662 --> 09:23.970
Louis, this is your problem.

09:23.994 --> 09:26.017
You're creepy! Nobody likes you.

09:26.041 --> 09:28.845
What you call a conversation
the rest of us call harassment.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.669
You want a friend,
get a hamster.

09:33.644 --> 09:35.081
David!

09:35.105 --> 09:36.605
Aah!

09:42.713 --> 09:43.930
Call the police!

09:43.954 --> 09:45.624
Stay there!

09:55.696 --> 09:57.744
That's right, you better run,

09:57.768 --> 10:00.647
'cause I'm gonna get
some bullets for this thing

10:00.671 --> 10:02.048
and come after you! Freeze!

10:02.072 --> 10:04.310
Hey, everything's cool.

10:04.334 --> 10:06.212
Aah!

10:10.741 --> 10:12.341
Are you okay?

10:23.623 --> 10:28.374
Weeds are a common annoyance
of life in suburbia,

10:28.398 --> 10:31.998
and no matter how hard
we try to get rid of them...

10:33.664 --> 10:36.674
They always tend to crop
back up.

10:39.009 --> 10:41.087
A-Are you seeing this?

10:41.111 --> 10:44.190
I don't believe him.
He is so brazen.

10:44.214 --> 10:47.854
He's just mowing the lawn
like nothing ever happened.

10:47.878 --> 10:50.857
What should we do? Should we
call the police? Well, Susan did say

10:50.881 --> 10:53.700
that he murdered Mrs. Huber,
so my vote would be yes.

10:53.724 --> 10:56.194
Oh, my god, Susan's home.

11:02.693 --> 11:04.943
Has she seen Paul yet?

11:10.170 --> 11:12.700
I think so.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.928
Hello, Susan.

11:21.952 --> 11:24.831
Oh, my god. Paul.

11:24.855 --> 11:26.863
Need some help with those bags?

11:26.887 --> 11:31.197
Why... are you doing here?

11:31.221 --> 11:34.771
This is where I live.
I came home to find my son.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.845
Here you go.
No, don't come near me.

11:38.869 --> 11:41.708
I'm just giving you back your pie
filling. I don't want my pie filling.

11:41.732 --> 11:43.980
Oh, come on. Just take it.
No, stop!

11:44.004 --> 11:46.452
Put that pie filling down.

11:46.476 --> 11:48.815
Slowly.

11:48.839 --> 11:50.717
I'm calling 9-1-1.
You don't want to do that.

11:50.741 --> 11:54.290
Oh, I think I do.
You're a cold-blooded murderer.

11:54.314 --> 11:57.424
Susan, how can you believe that?
We've been neighbors for years.

11:59.790 --> 12:01.868
Ladies, good to see you.

12:01.892 --> 12:03.429
Paul, we've called the police.

12:03.453 --> 12:05.772
You didn't really need
to do that.

12:05.796 --> 12:07.804
We know what you did
to Mrs. Huber.

12:07.828 --> 12:10.306
Wonderful. I see you've all
turned into Susan

12:10.330 --> 12:12.000
while I've been gone.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.844
Oh, thank god. They're here.

12:21.741 --> 12:24.751
Hey, what's going on?

12:24.775 --> 12:26.322
Oh, Mayer's convinced

12:26.346 --> 12:28.494
that Paul young murdered
Martha Huber.

12:28.518 --> 12:30.496
Oh, my god.
I live right behind him.

12:30.520 --> 12:34.300
I know. I gave him
my house keys to feed my cat.

12:34.324 --> 12:38.835
I win. I made out with him.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.768
Here you go. There's no warrant
here for a Paul young.

12:41.792 --> 12:44.070
Why don't you ask Mike?
He overheard everything, right?

12:44.094 --> 12:45.817
Who's Mike?
Uh, he's my boyfriend,

12:45.841 --> 12:48.815
and he told me that Paul
confessed everything to him.

12:48.839 --> 12:50.777
Oh, and Mike has
Martha's journals,

12:50.801 --> 12:52.919
which clearly prove
that Paul had a motive.

12:52.943 --> 12:55.927
All right, all right, where do I find
this Mike guy? Uh, he's... follow me.

12:55.951 --> 12:59.025
You mind if I stay here?
I've got a lot of raking to do.

12:59.049 --> 13:01.349
Let's go.

13:08.058 --> 13:11.888
Hey.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.501
What's going on?

13:15.525 --> 13:17.403
Mike, Paul young is back.

13:17.427 --> 13:19.497
Look.

13:28.208 --> 13:32.118
Your girlfriend said Mr. Young
confessed a murder to you?

13:32.142 --> 13:34.891
Um...

13:34.915 --> 13:38.294
No. No, not to me.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.396
And I don't suppose you have
a journal that belonged

13:40.420 --> 13:42.798
to a Martha Huber?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.400
No. I hardly knew her.

13:44.424 --> 13:47.911
Besides, you ever known a woman
who'd loan out her diary?

13:47.935 --> 13:49.836
Mike, what are you doing?

13:49.860 --> 13:52.808
I'm sorry, Susan. I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.889
But I've got a job to get to.
Is there anything else?

13:55.913 --> 13:58.606
No, no,
that pretty much covers it.

14:14.384 --> 14:16.371
Well, someone might as well
say it.

14:16.395 --> 14:19.456
Susan, what the hell
have you been smoking?

14:24.895 --> 14:27.165
Ahem. Okay.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.017
Wow!

14:31.041 --> 14:32.848
Nice.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.921
Oh, my god.

14:34.945 --> 14:37.353
Okay, don't be distracted
by that. Look atme.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.885
Here I am tomorrow,

14:38.909 --> 14:41.087
making my presentation.

14:41.111 --> 14:44.860
You see?
You see how it moves with me?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.893
That's where themagicis.

14:46.917 --> 14:49.335
$900?

14:49.359 --> 14:51.337
Yeah, well, this one was
the most expensive.

14:51.361 --> 14:53.339
The other ones aren't as nice.
But look.

14:53.363 --> 14:56.380
Look, look, look, look at me,
look at me. Watch.

14:56.404 --> 14:58.905
I don't walk in it. I glide.

14:58.929 --> 15:01.978
Um, honey, you know what?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.986
There's gotta be like
$3,000 worth of clothes here.

15:05.010 --> 15:08.014
Yeah, well, I haven't bought
a new suit in six years.

15:08.038 --> 15:09.515
So? When I was working,

15:09.539 --> 15:11.958
you don't think I would have
loved to have a designer suit?

15:11.982 --> 15:13.419
I wore wash-and-wear

15:13.443 --> 15:15.426
so that we could live
in a nice neighborhood,

15:15.450 --> 15:17.964
so we could take the kids
on vacation every summer.

15:17.988 --> 15:21.097
I mean, I made sacrifices.
I'm willing to make sacrifices.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.099
Great, well, let's start here,

15:23.123 --> 15:26.010
because this should cover
a math tutor for Parker.

15:26.034 --> 15:28.004
Whoa, hold on a sec.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.076
Six months of preschool
for penny.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.038
All right, now you're being ridiculous.
You know what? And the twins...

15:32.062 --> 15:34.540
They're gonna need braces.
That oughta make a dent.

15:34.564 --> 15:38.945
Oh, no. Come on, Tom.
Not this one.

15:38.969 --> 15:41.087
Strip.

15:41.111 --> 15:44.050
You saw the walk, right?

15:44.074 --> 15:46.993
You wanna see the walk again?

15:47.017 --> 15:49.325
I'll tutor Parker myself.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.027
Honey, that'd be great.

15:51.051 --> 15:53.121
You also gonna take up
home dentistry?

16:02.032 --> 16:04.732
Fine. I'll take them back.

16:07.237 --> 16:10.137
Could you step out
for a minute, please?

16:12.002 --> 16:15.482
I want to be alone with it
for a little while.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.370
Hi, it's Bree.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.447
Hi. I was thinking
about calling you.

16:36.471 --> 16:39.445
I just got some new
antihistamines in at the store.

16:39.469 --> 16:42.148
I think they're really gonna
help with your rash.

16:42.172 --> 16:45.156
Well, great. Um, how would
you feel about the two of us

16:45.180 --> 16:47.653
checking into a romantic hotel
tomorrow?

16:47.677 --> 16:52.118
What? Uh, i-I'd like that
very much.

16:52.142 --> 16:54.620
I will let you make
all of the arrangements.

16:54.644 --> 16:57.093
Something out of town
would be nice.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.147
Good night.

17:14.104 --> 17:17.183
We need to talk.
Where did you come from?

17:17.207 --> 17:18.483
I'm sorry.
I've been waiting for you.

17:18.508 --> 17:21.117
I'm just a little upset because
everybody thinks I'm crazy.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.189
Can I at least get out
of the truck first?

17:23.213 --> 17:24.589
Yes, definitely.

17:24.614 --> 17:26.097
I mean, I can understand

17:26.121 --> 17:29.355
why you wouldn't want the cops
to know that you kidnapped Paul.

17:29.379 --> 17:31.727
I mean, that definitely looks
bad. Since I was on probation.

17:31.751 --> 17:35.030
Well, right.
I mean, there's that.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.511
And in possession of a gun...

17:36.535 --> 17:39.135
Well, okay...
Which I held to his head.

17:39.159 --> 17:41.437
So I violated my probation,
committed a felony

17:41.461 --> 17:43.139
and coerced a confession.

17:43.163 --> 17:45.250
If the cops found out
about that,

17:45.274 --> 17:48.214
I'd be looking
at 10 to 15 years.

17:48.238 --> 17:49.715
But why don't you want 'em

17:49.739 --> 17:51.717
to know about
Martha Huber's journal?

17:51.741 --> 17:53.219
I mean, she says right in there

17:53.243 --> 17:55.226
that she was blackmailing
Paul's wife.

17:55.250 --> 17:58.524
She also says right in there
that she was blackmailingyou

17:58.548 --> 18:00.786
for burning down Edie's house.

18:00.810 --> 18:02.588
Oh.

18:02.612 --> 18:04.130
I forgot about that.

18:07.287 --> 18:10.136
I just can't believe it.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.138
I mean, there he is, a murderer,

18:12.162 --> 18:14.140
just living right on our street,

18:14.164 --> 18:15.149
and there's nothing
we can do about it

18:15.173 --> 18:16.442
because you're a convicted felon

18:16.466 --> 18:19.145
and I burned down that
stupid house. It's not fair.

18:19.169 --> 18:21.147
I want Paul young gone
as badly as you do,

18:21.171 --> 18:24.510
and he will be,
but I also want to find Zach.

18:24.534 --> 18:27.161
I think once Zach finds out
Paul's here,

18:27.185 --> 18:29.737
I got a feeling he'll be back.

18:31.741 --> 18:34.881
Well, that's comforting to know
there's a silver lining.

18:48.398 --> 18:49.635
Hi.

18:49.659 --> 18:51.737
What are you doing here?

18:51.761 --> 18:54.240
Well, you protected me
from a hail of gunfire,

18:54.264 --> 18:57.117
so I thought I'd stop by
and give you a card.

18:57.141 --> 18:58.414
You're my first visitor.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.886
What do you mean,
I'm your first visitor?

19:00.910 --> 19:02.888
You've been here two days.

19:02.912 --> 19:05.422
My office sent me flowers.

19:07.417 --> 19:10.156
Oh. "Dear David",

19:10.180 --> 19:12.828
"who knew you could
actually bleed?"

19:12.852 --> 19:15.401
"Sincerely,
your stunned co-workers."

19:15.425 --> 19:17.403
Yeah, well, I'm a lawyer
who got shot.

19:17.427 --> 19:19.265
Everybody's cracking wise.

19:19.289 --> 19:20.836
You're not gonna eat.

19:20.860 --> 19:25.241
Uh, can't really cut yet.

19:25.265 --> 19:28.274
Well, I'm not gonna let you
starve to death.

19:28.298 --> 19:30.276
Besides, you're gonna need
your strength

19:30.300 --> 19:33.470
to get my husband out of jail.

19:37.507 --> 19:41.247
You know, when I was waiting for
the ambulance the other day...

19:42.412 --> 19:44.412
I seriously thought
I was gonna die.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.455
I was scared.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.590
Of course you were.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.370
Thanks.

19:54.394 --> 19:56.802
For what?

19:56.826 --> 19:59.945
For not making any jokes.

19:59.969 --> 20:02.648
Sure.

20:02.672 --> 20:05.512
Now... open up.

20:08.578 --> 20:09.715
Here.

20:09.739 --> 20:12.358
Thank you.

20:12.382 --> 20:15.899
I'm glad that you could all make
it here on such short notice.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.215
Yeah.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.736
Just follow this hallway
straight down there

20:25.760 --> 20:27.803
and make yourselves comfortable.

20:27.827 --> 20:29.805
For the good of their family,

20:29.829 --> 20:32.759
Lynette had made a promise
to her husband...

20:35.305 --> 20:37.383
And within ten days
from the date of purchase,

20:37.407 --> 20:39.407
she intended to keep it.

20:47.847 --> 20:49.825
Oh. That's a fantastic suit.

20:49.849 --> 20:50.826
Oh. Thanks.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.328
I'm flattered, really.

20:52.352 --> 20:55.339
I mean, who knew that you cared
so much about what I think?

20:55.363 --> 20:57.403
I don't follow you.

20:57.427 --> 20:59.405
Well, I make
a few innocent comments,

20:59.429 --> 21:02.768
and you go out and buy yourself
a gorgeous new suit.

21:02.792 --> 21:04.510
Dance, puppet, dance.

21:04.534 --> 21:06.781
Well, actually, this was
already in my closet.

21:06.805 --> 21:08.944
I just forgot about it.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.438
Forgot? You forgot
that you hadthatsuit?

21:14.404 --> 21:17.022
Good morning. Hi.

21:17.046 --> 21:18.624
I'm Lynette Scavo.

21:18.648 --> 21:21.757
Now is everyone taken care of
in terms of coffee

21:21.781 --> 21:24.290
and whatever else they may like?
Great.

21:24.314 --> 21:26.292
Well, then let's get started.

21:26.316 --> 21:27.593
I will show you

21:27.617 --> 21:30.436
how kamarov vodka can expand
its customer mindshare

21:30.460 --> 21:33.499
while still holding the line
on marketing costs.

21:33.523 --> 21:37.603
It's something we here
at parcher and Murphy

21:37.627 --> 21:40.476
like to call
"persuasive engineering."

21:40.500 --> 21:42.047
Lynette...

21:42.071 --> 21:44.650
Just hold on one second.

21:44.674 --> 21:46.652
Ahem.

21:46.676 --> 21:49.355
Ahem. You have a...

21:50.740 --> 21:53.559
They put the price tags
on the skirts these days, too,

21:53.583 --> 21:55.083
just so you know.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.893
Look at that, everybody.

21:57.917 --> 22:02.398
Lynette just bought herself
a beautiful, brand-new suit.

22:02.422 --> 22:04.092
Doesn't she look great?

22:07.897 --> 22:08.974
Go on.

22:08.998 --> 22:12.408
Okay.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.702
You may be seated.

22:15.435 --> 22:18.605
Good to see you back
on your feet, Mr. Bradley.

22:20.109 --> 22:22.488
Whenever you're ready.

22:22.512 --> 22:24.112
Thank you, your honor.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.824
The defense moves to dismiss
this case immediately

22:28.848 --> 22:32.048
on the grounds
that the defendant...

22:38.528 --> 22:41.628
Are you all right, Mr. Bradley?

22:45.465 --> 22:47.595
I'm sorry, your honor.
I just can't.

22:51.401 --> 22:53.849
I just can't.

22:53.873 --> 22:57.113
Mr. Bradley,
do you need a recess?

22:58.478 --> 23:00.386
What the hell's going on?

23:00.410 --> 23:03.429
David, where are you going?

23:03.453 --> 23:04.930
I'm sorry. I quit.

23:04.954 --> 23:07.438
You can't just quit
in the middle of a hearing.

23:07.462 --> 23:09.995
I'd love to get
your idiot husband out of jail,

23:10.019 --> 23:11.667
but I just can't do it. I'm
sorry. Yeah. Why not?

23:11.691 --> 23:13.368
Because I'm in love with you.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.870
What?

23:14.894 --> 23:17.578
The other day in the hospital,
I started to feel something.

23:17.602 --> 23:19.745
I don't know.
Maybe it was there all along.

23:19.769 --> 23:23.709
But when I look into your eyes,
I know you feel it, too.

23:23.733 --> 23:25.451
We belong together.

23:25.475 --> 23:26.752
Okay, David,

23:26.776 --> 23:29.455
if you don't get back
in there right now,

23:29.479 --> 23:33.419
I will go get a gun
and shoot you myself.

23:33.443 --> 23:35.461
I can't.

23:35.485 --> 23:36.685
I'm sorry.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.560
Come in!

23:54.504 --> 23:56.442
We need to talk.

23:56.466 --> 23:58.744
Oh! Oh! Uh, uh...

23:58.768 --> 24:01.487
Paul, you... you can't just
waltz into people's houses.

24:01.511 --> 24:03.018
Susan, you told me to come in.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.020
Well, that's 'cause I assumed

24:05.044 --> 24:06.861
you were someone
I would let in my house.

24:06.885 --> 24:08.554
What do you want?

24:08.578 --> 24:11.527
I was looking through my mail,
and I found this.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.529
I was surprised to discover

24:13.553 --> 24:15.566
that you were looking
for my son.

24:15.590 --> 24:17.533
You didn't happen to find
anything out

24:17.557 --> 24:19.535
about where Zach might be,
did you?

24:19.559 --> 24:21.837
No. No, I didn't.

24:21.861 --> 24:24.570
Sorry I can't help you out.

24:24.594 --> 24:26.517
I'm asking because
if you remember,

24:26.541 --> 24:28.514
Zach hid here
in this house before,

24:28.538 --> 24:31.076
and now I learn that
you've been searching for him.

24:31.100 --> 24:33.549
Well, he's not here.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.080
Hmm.

24:35.104 --> 24:37.061
Well, maybe we should
double-check.

24:37.085 --> 24:40.055
But he's not here. I swear.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.209
What are you grabbing for?

24:44.483 --> 24:46.832
A knife.

24:46.856 --> 24:49.556
I just want to slice
some tomatoes.

24:57.967 --> 24:59.875
I don't know how I know this,

24:59.899 --> 25:01.929
but I-I think that he's in Utah.

25:03.803 --> 25:06.552
He... he took a bus to bountiful.

25:06.576 --> 25:08.236
You have family there, right?

25:10.509 --> 25:13.139
Okay, I gave him the bus fare.

25:26.996 --> 25:29.234
You might want to be
careful with that.

25:29.258 --> 25:31.528
You seem a little jittery.

25:38.768 --> 25:42.117
Look, I know the timing is bad.

25:42.141 --> 25:43.288
Pretty bad.

25:43.312 --> 25:44.790
I feel terrible.

25:44.814 --> 25:47.761
How was I supposed to know
that he would take a bullet

25:47.785 --> 25:50.696
and suddenly realize
he's in love with me?

25:50.720 --> 25:53.699
Okay, look, I know I pushed you
into hiring that creep,

25:53.723 --> 25:57.110
but I promise I will do
anything I can to fix this.

25:57.134 --> 26:00.706
All right, go have sex
with Bradley.

26:00.730 --> 26:01.837
What?

26:01.861 --> 26:04.640
Well, that's what you want me
to say, isn't it?

26:04.664 --> 26:07.748
God, you guys are good.
I mean, you set me up perfectly.

26:07.772 --> 26:10.716
You think David and I planned
this so we could sleep together?

26:10.740 --> 26:13.548
Let's see. The guy tells me
to my face that he wants

26:13.572 --> 26:16.259
to get into your pants,
quits a week before my trial,

26:16.283 --> 26:20.255
and now you can't wait
to doanythingto get him back?

26:20.279 --> 26:23.158
Yeah. I'd like to go back
to jail now.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.160
How dare you think that of me?

26:25.184 --> 26:27.771
I have been nothing
but faithful to you!

26:27.795 --> 26:29.595
Since you've been in here.

26:29.619 --> 26:32.197
Save it.
I know when I've been outfoxed,

26:32.221 --> 26:35.200
and please don't pretend
that you're doing this for me,

26:35.224 --> 26:37.207
'cause I'd rather rot in here.
And you know what?

26:37.231 --> 26:39.204
A lesser woman
would let you rot in here,

26:39.228 --> 26:40.706
but I'm not gonna do that.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.708
I'm not gonna give you
the satisfaction.

26:42.732 --> 26:44.710
So you better start
packing up your shanks

26:44.734 --> 26:46.917
or whatever you people
make in here,

26:46.941 --> 26:49.106
because you're coming home
with me!

26:52.311 --> 26:54.311
I don't have any shanks.

26:58.688 --> 27:00.726
Good afternoon. Checking in?

27:00.750 --> 27:04.329
Yes. Reservations in the name
of Williams... George Williams.

27:04.353 --> 27:05.600
Let me get your paperwork.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.607
So what do you want to do first?

27:07.631 --> 27:10.105
I don't know. I thought maybe
we could go antiquing.

27:10.129 --> 27:12.678
I hear you have
some lovely museums nearby.

27:12.702 --> 27:14.309
Do you have any brochures?

27:14.333 --> 27:16.250
Right over there, Mrs. Williams.

27:16.274 --> 27:18.013
Oh, uh, she's not my wife.

27:18.037 --> 27:21.067
I'm so sorry.

27:25.014 --> 27:27.631
So I hear they have a terrific
farmers' market nearby.

27:27.655 --> 27:30.996
We should pick up
some nectarines.

27:31.020 --> 27:32.798
George...

27:32.822 --> 27:33.799
I can't.

27:33.823 --> 27:35.100
What?

27:35.124 --> 27:37.808
I can't stay in a hotel
room with you. Why not?

27:37.832 --> 27:40.005
Because I am starting
to get that rash again.

27:40.029 --> 27:42.207
Well, I brought
the antihistamines.

27:42.231 --> 27:43.709
Oh, please. It's not gonna help.

27:43.733 --> 27:45.720
George, clearly,
this is psychosomatic.

27:45.744 --> 27:47.713
We need to go home.

27:47.737 --> 27:50.175
Bree, we just drove
three hours to get here.

27:50.199 --> 27:52.377
I know, and you have
every right to be mad,

27:52.401 --> 27:54.379
but, George, I am really
starting to itch.

27:54.403 --> 27:55.881
Is there a problem?

27:55.905 --> 27:58.053
Uh, no, there's no problem.
Everything is fine.

27:58.077 --> 28:01.286
Okay, okay, okay, okay. Uh, uh,

28:01.310 --> 28:03.428
I'll get you your own room.
George...

28:03.452 --> 28:05.936
No, no, no. We can still
have a nice weekend.

28:05.960 --> 28:07.933
We'll just shift the focus
to... antiquing.

28:07.957 --> 28:09.895
Please. I mean, clearly,
you didn't come here to shop.

28:09.919 --> 28:12.067
No, I came to spend time
with you...

28:12.091 --> 28:14.740
Time that does not need
to be spent in a bed.

28:14.764 --> 28:16.751
Really? You mean that?
You wouldn't mind?

28:16.775 --> 28:17.803
No.

28:17.827 --> 28:19.304
You know what, George?

28:19.328 --> 28:21.306
We're gonna have a great time,

28:21.330 --> 28:23.749
because there's tons
of fun stuff we can do

28:23.773 --> 28:25.050
that doesn't involve sex.

28:25.074 --> 28:26.752
You betcha.

28:26.776 --> 28:28.754
While I take care of this,

28:28.778 --> 28:31.038
why don't you go get
those brochures? Okay.

28:32.942 --> 28:34.720
George, you won't believe it.

28:34.744 --> 28:36.792
I just stopped itching.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.323
How about that?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.402
Nice suit.

28:47.426 --> 28:49.134
Just hear me out.

28:49.158 --> 28:52.007
I was gonna take it back,
I swear. But?

28:52.031 --> 28:54.409
But then I started thinking
about it, and you know what?

28:54.433 --> 28:57.817
I'll be damned if I'm gonna
pitch to a roomful of people

28:57.841 --> 28:59.915
who are all wearing
Armani and Vera wang

28:59.939 --> 29:03.218
while I'm standing there
with 2-year-old breast milk

29:03.242 --> 29:05.090
crusted on my lapel. Lynette...

29:05.114 --> 29:06.792
And you know what else?

29:06.816 --> 29:09.054
I kickedassin that meeting
because of this suit.

29:09.078 --> 29:12.427
Lynette, it is a suit.
Why are you so obsessed with it?

29:12.451 --> 29:14.429
You can't explain obsession,
Tom.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.261
It just... is.

29:16.285 --> 29:17.763
No, we are parents.

29:17.787 --> 29:19.905
We can't afford
the luxury of obsessions.

29:19.929 --> 29:22.407
See? That's where I think
we have been making

29:22.431 --> 29:25.231
a terrible, terrible mistake.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.916
What is this?

29:30.940 --> 29:35.781
Sometimes we just need to get
something that makesushappy.

29:35.805 --> 29:38.824
I know that sounds selfish,
but I've been thinking.

29:38.848 --> 29:40.826
It might make us better people

29:40.850 --> 29:43.250
and maybe even better parents.

29:44.914 --> 29:47.264
No. No, Lynette, no.
This is wrong.

29:51.891 --> 29:56.971
Carbon... fiber... shafts.

30:16.886 --> 30:17.923
Wow.

30:17.947 --> 30:20.287
I feel like a better parent
already.

30:23.853 --> 30:25.170
Oh, yeah.

30:25.194 --> 30:27.873
So I was talking to one
of the bellmen,

30:27.897 --> 30:30.876
and he said there's a place
not far from here

30:30.900 --> 30:32.938
where we could go
horseback riding.

30:32.962 --> 30:35.941
Doesn't that sound like fun?
George?

30:35.965 --> 30:38.944
Wh-what? What? I'm sorry.

30:38.968 --> 30:41.987
I was saying I think
we should go horseback riding.

30:42.011 --> 30:44.571
Oh, sure. That'd be great.

30:47.516 --> 30:48.593
What's wrong?

30:48.617 --> 30:49.594
Nothing.

30:49.618 --> 30:51.596
I-I just don't think
that we should risk

30:51.620 --> 30:53.158
you getting another rash.

30:53.182 --> 30:55.909
Well, I'm not gonna get another
rash just by holding your hand.

30:55.933 --> 30:58.003
You never know.

30:58.027 --> 31:02.287
Oh. Well, okay.

31:06.395 --> 31:11.116
Hey, uh, I brought
those antihistamines with me.

31:11.140 --> 31:14.019
Maybe you should take a couple,
just to see if it works.

31:14.043 --> 31:15.520
Oh, I'm drinking wine.

31:15.544 --> 31:19.191
I don't think you're supposed
to mix pills with alcohol.

31:19.215 --> 31:21.186
That's for people who are...

31:21.210 --> 31:23.188
Who are about to use
heavy machinery.

31:23.212 --> 31:26.436
You don't plan on operating
a forklift tonight, do you?

31:26.460 --> 31:28.433
Well, you're the pharmacist.

31:28.457 --> 31:30.265
If you think it's okay...

31:30.289 --> 31:31.559
I do.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.919
George, I can't feel my legs.

31:53.943 --> 31:55.926
I know, sweetheart.
Don't you worry.

31:55.950 --> 31:57.923
I'm gonna take you to your room,

31:57.947 --> 31:59.995
and then we're gonna
get you into bed. Okay.

32:00.019 --> 32:01.296
Is she going to be okay?

32:01.320 --> 32:03.999
Yeah, she's just had
a little too much wine.

32:04.023 --> 32:06.310
I don't think
it was the wine, George.

32:06.334 --> 32:09.004
I think it was
the antihistamines.

32:09.028 --> 32:12.198
She doesn't know what
she's... we're good, thank you.

32:18.707 --> 32:20.015
Oh.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.248
No, no, no, no, no.

32:23.272 --> 32:25.312
I'll get those. You just relax.

32:32.982 --> 32:35.969
I love you very much, Bree.
You know that, right?

32:35.993 --> 32:38.525
I know.

32:45.234 --> 32:47.272
And I want

32:47.296 --> 32:49.944
more than anything

32:49.968 --> 32:52.077
for you to love me back.

32:52.101 --> 32:56.081
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

32:56.105 --> 32:57.983
Bree?

33:28.537 --> 33:29.607
Hey there.

33:31.180 --> 33:33.218
How you feeling?

33:33.242 --> 33:36.691
Oh, okay.

33:38.387 --> 33:41.066
Have you been sitting there
all this time?

33:41.090 --> 33:43.368
I wanted to make sure
you were okay,

33:43.392 --> 33:45.400
so I stayed
and watched you sleep.

33:45.424 --> 33:49.174
Did I do anything embarrassing?
Sometimes I snore.

33:49.198 --> 33:53.078
No. No, you slept like an angel.

33:53.102 --> 33:55.380
In fact, you were
so beautiful and peaceful,

33:55.404 --> 33:57.742
I actually started
to feel guilty.

33:57.766 --> 33:59.514
Guilty?

33:59.538 --> 34:02.117
Um, well, you know,

34:02.141 --> 34:04.549
'cause I told you
take those pills.

34:04.573 --> 34:06.430
That chair looks
so uncomfortable.

34:06.454 --> 34:08.652
Why didn't you sleep next to me?

34:08.677 --> 34:10.495
Well, you made it pretty clear

34:10.518 --> 34:12.518
that you don't want me
in your bed.

34:15.184 --> 34:16.634
George.

34:19.757 --> 34:21.735
I know what you want from me,

34:21.760 --> 34:23.737
and I thought I wanted
the same thing,

34:23.762 --> 34:29.574
but I keep getting
those rashes because...

34:29.598 --> 34:31.775
I still feel married.

34:31.800 --> 34:35.580
Makes sense, I guess.

34:35.603 --> 34:40.625
Can't you just be patient?

34:40.649 --> 34:43.128
Can't you wait
just a little bit longer?

34:43.152 --> 34:46.391
I've already waited
my whole life for you,

34:46.415 --> 34:48.393
and I can wait a little more.

34:48.417 --> 34:49.594
Mmm.

34:49.618 --> 34:52.297
But let's be honest.

34:52.321 --> 34:54.821
There's no guarantee
that you'll ever be ready.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.765
There's only so much rejection
I can take.

35:01.470 --> 35:04.209
So...

35:04.233 --> 35:06.111
I'll do my best,

35:06.135 --> 35:08.213
but... don't be surprised

35:08.237 --> 35:11.556
if one of these days
you wake up and...

35:11.580 --> 35:13.140
I'm not here.

35:15.644 --> 35:17.631
Well, I should get back
to my room,

35:17.655 --> 35:19.624
try to get a little sleep.

35:19.648 --> 35:22.148
The antique stores open at 10.

35:24.893 --> 35:29.103
George, wait.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.797
Please don't go.

35:40.669 --> 35:42.709
Stay here with me.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.229
But what if you get
another rash?

35:54.253 --> 35:59.233
Well, I'll just...
Have to get over it, won't I?

36:46.905 --> 36:48.783
Gabrielle?

36:48.807 --> 36:50.307
I got your call...

36:54.743 --> 36:56.221
Wow.

36:56.245 --> 36:57.862
Does this mean
what I think it means?

36:57.886 --> 37:01.226
There are
some ground rules first.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.320
I'm not leaving my husband.

37:04.453 --> 37:06.876
Carlos is looking at
spending eight years in jail

37:06.900 --> 37:09.334
because of my lapse of judgment
with the gardener.

37:09.358 --> 37:12.337
I can't let him rot in there.
I'd be filled with guilt.

37:12.361 --> 37:15.510
You could get him out
and then divorce him.

37:15.534 --> 37:20.245
Not an option.
I'm catholic, hence the guilt.

37:20.269 --> 37:23.688
So what are our options?

37:23.712 --> 37:26.391
This, us, stolen moments,

37:26.415 --> 37:28.393
seeing each other
whenever we can.

37:28.417 --> 37:30.417
Carlos never needs to know.

37:33.322 --> 37:34.422
No.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.471
I thought this was
what you wanted.

37:38.495 --> 37:41.666
I want all of you.

37:41.690 --> 37:43.308
All or nothing.

37:43.332 --> 37:47.302
Then it's nothing.

37:50.299 --> 37:54.619
So you won't get a divorce,
but you'll have an affair?

37:54.643 --> 37:58.883
I said I was catholic,
not a fanatic.

37:58.907 --> 38:02.627
You know, David,
you could tell me to stop.

38:02.651 --> 38:06.391
Just tell me to stop,
and I will,

38:06.415 --> 38:08.993
or you can have me right now...

38:09.017 --> 38:10.687
On my terms.

38:13.922 --> 38:15.400
All right.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.973
Ow! Ow! Ow!

38:18.997 --> 38:20.975
Ow! What are you doing?

38:20.999 --> 38:23.308
Making my point.

38:23.332 --> 38:24.949
You don't love me.

38:24.973 --> 38:26.611
Aah! Yes, I do.

38:26.635 --> 38:28.613
No. You just agreed
to an affair...

38:28.637 --> 38:31.756
A cheap, illicit affair
with the woman you "love."

38:31.780 --> 38:33.958
Carlos would never share me.

38:33.982 --> 38:35.960
He's looking
at eight years in prison

38:35.984 --> 38:38.971
because the mere thought of it
sent him into a violent rage.

38:38.995 --> 38:40.465
Thatis love.

38:40.489 --> 38:43.749
This is... this is just lust,
mixed with posttraumatic stress.

38:45.093 --> 38:47.010
I will see you in court
tomorrow at 10 A.M.

38:47.034 --> 38:49.334
And don't be late,

38:49.358 --> 38:51.928
or else I'll have you disbarred
for sexual harassment.

39:08.577 --> 39:11.496
I'd take it easy
with that snail poison.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.399
It's hell on your agapanthus.

39:14.423 --> 39:16.631
Thanks. I'll keep that in mind.

39:16.655 --> 39:18.833
Is that why you stopped by...

39:18.857 --> 39:21.506
Share a few gardening tips?

39:21.530 --> 39:25.670
Nobody wants you here, Paul,
especially me.

39:25.694 --> 39:28.373
I'm just a father
looking for his son.

39:28.397 --> 39:31.497
Oh, I know what you are.

39:32.741 --> 39:35.420
First, your girlfriend
tries to run me off

39:35.444 --> 39:37.731
with some crazy story
about sending Zach to Utah.

39:37.755 --> 39:40.525
Now you're here
trying to scare me away.

39:40.549 --> 39:43.379
So much for "love thy neighbor."

39:45.414 --> 39:47.541
Anyway, thanks for the advice.

39:47.565 --> 39:51.095
About my agapanthus, I mean.

39:51.119 --> 39:53.938
I'll make sure I send you some.

39:53.962 --> 39:56.732
What did Susan tell you?

39:59.598 --> 40:01.075
Oh!

40:01.099 --> 40:04.549
You look beautiful.

40:04.573 --> 40:06.560
Oh, you should really
consider wearing this

40:06.584 --> 40:08.583
when you marry Mike.

40:08.607 --> 40:10.515
We could make it
a family tradition.

40:10.539 --> 40:12.517
Why don't we both stop
getting divorced?

40:12.541 --> 40:14.819
That would be a nice
family tradition. Oh.

40:14.843 --> 40:17.992
Hey!

40:18.016 --> 40:20.525
I need to ask you
something important.

40:20.549 --> 40:22.497
Oh, my god!

40:22.521 --> 40:23.768
Aah! This is it!

40:23.792 --> 40:26.931
Oh! Let me get my camera.

40:26.955 --> 40:29.003
Oh, no, mom, stop!

40:29.027 --> 40:30.735
What is it?

40:30.759 --> 40:33.599
Did you give Zach money
to go to Utah?

40:35.964 --> 40:37.181
What?

40:37.205 --> 40:39.435
Yes or no.

40:41.540 --> 40:45.119
He was talking so much
about Julie.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.723
I tried to get him
to come home with me...

40:48.747 --> 40:50.625
I mean, to... to you,

40:50.649 --> 40:53.127
but he just kept going
on and on about her,

40:53.151 --> 40:54.629
and I got scared.

40:54.653 --> 40:57.133
Yes or no.

40:58.627 --> 41:00.127
Yes.

41:02.731 --> 41:05.870
Mike. Mike, I didn't do it
to hurt you.

41:05.894 --> 41:08.473
You've gotta believe me. I...

41:08.497 --> 41:10.745
I should have told you
right away. I know that.

41:10.769 --> 41:14.549
But you know now,
so can we please talk about it? No.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.850
Mike, stop.

41:15.874 --> 41:18.531
Susan, you said you wanted to
help me, and I believed you.

41:18.555 --> 41:20.525
That's it. We're done.

41:20.549 --> 41:21.849
No...

41:25.253 --> 41:28.563
No, no, no, no!

41:28.587 --> 41:30.565
I screwed up, okay?!

41:30.589 --> 41:33.568
I want to fix it!
Please let me fix it!

41:33.592 --> 41:36.841
Tell me how to fix it!

41:36.865 --> 41:40.525
Mike... I love you.

41:43.632 --> 41:45.580
Please, no, please.

41:46.835 --> 41:48.482
Please.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.255
No, Mike! Mike, please!

41:51.279 --> 41:53.518
Come back!

41:53.542 --> 41:56.821
Come back!

42:36.054 --> 42:40.705
Yes, every little girl
dreams of a big white wedding.

42:40.729 --> 42:42.707
But some dreams

42:42.731 --> 42:44.731
just don't come true.
