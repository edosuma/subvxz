Whoa, whoa.

00:15.558 --> 00:17.458
A little help
would be nice, babe.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.893
No way, you're
doing great.

00:18.895 --> 00:20.595
Oh! If this thing

I don't know, man,

00:47.357 --> 00:50.391
but a piece of it hit the boat.
Looks like some kind of metal.

Thanks for coming.

02:27.741 --> 02:29.991
I'm glad you called.

02:34.279 --> 02:37.364
I've been thinking a lot
about our last conversation.

02:38.867 --> 02:43.221
How you wanted to know what
brought me back to Hawai'i.

02:43.223 --> 02:46.474
Well, a month ago,
I would've told you it was...

02:46.476 --> 02:48.926
to find the man
who killed my father.

02:53.565 --> 02:56.684
I realized it was
about more than that.

03:01.857 --> 03:04.025
I lost somebody.

03:05.043 --> 03:06.944
Somebody really close to me.

03:06.946 --> 03:10.231
He, um... he gave his life
to save mine.

03:13.285 --> 03:16.070
What was his name?

03:16.072 --> 03:19.090
His name was Freddie Hart.

03:19.092 --> 03:21.292
He was a team guy.
We went through BUDs together.

03:21.294 --> 03:23.127
We always had each other's back.

03:24.396 --> 03:26.531
He was my brother.

03:27.966 --> 03:29.750
More than anything
else in this world,

03:29.752 --> 03:31.919
Freddie wanted to be a
father. That was it.

03:31.921 --> 03:34.138
He would've been a
great father, too.

03:41.864 --> 03:45.733
Anyway, after he died, um...

03:45.735 --> 03:48.202
the Navy didn't feel the same.

03:50.072 --> 03:52.623
When the governor offered
me Five-O I jumped at it.

03:55.945 --> 03:58.112
You ran away.

04:05.337 --> 04:08.606
Yeah.

04:08.608 --> 04:11.058
We think that distance
is gonna make things better,

04:11.060 --> 04:13.060
and for a while
it kind of does.

04:13.062 --> 04:15.963
But sooner or later,
it catches up to you that...

04:15.965 --> 04:18.599
the real problem
you're having is all up here.

04:21.503 --> 04:23.688
You sleeping?

04:25.140 --> 04:28.276
When was the last time
you had a good night's sleep?

04:33.148 --> 04:35.116
Well...

04:35.118 --> 04:37.151
Like I said,
I'm glad you called.

04:37.153 --> 04:39.287
Thanks.

04:40.572 --> 04:43.224
You better get going, man.
You got a big day ahead of you.

04:43.226 --> 04:44.675
Yeah.

04:44.677 --> 04:46.327
Try not to have
too much fun today.

04:58.941 --> 05:00.441
Ma.

05:00.443 --> 05:02.393
In here.

05:02.395 --> 05:04.529
I made you lunch.

05:04.531 --> 05:06.314
Really? That's very nice.

05:07.700 --> 05:09.367
Tuna salad.
Uh-huh.

05:09.369 --> 05:10.952
That's nice, with
the pickles and the celery

05:10.954 --> 05:12.053
and the carrots
and everything.

05:12.055 --> 05:14.521
Yes, and a whole
lot of mama love.

05:15.657 --> 05:17.575
It, uh... it brings back
some memories, uh...

05:17.577 --> 05:19.627
That one time
you, uh...

05:19.629 --> 05:21.629
you sold my entire
baseball card collection

05:21.631 --> 05:22.830
at the garage sale.

05:22.832 --> 05:24.882
You made me...
you made me tuna salad.

05:24.884 --> 05:27.218
And then, uh...
you said we were gonna

05:27.220 --> 05:29.536
go see <i>Gremlins,</i> and then,
uh, we made a left

05:29.538 --> 05:31.923
and we went to the dentist
and you got me braces.

05:31.925 --> 05:33.874
You made me tuna salad,
just like this.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.560
I feel like
every time you, um...

05:35.562 --> 05:37.261
you do something
that you feel guilty about,

05:37.263 --> 05:39.730
you make me a tuna salad,
so I have to ask,

05:39.732 --> 05:41.816
is, uh, something coming?
Or what-what's going on?

05:41.818 --> 05:43.601
No, nothing.
No?

05:43.603 --> 05:46.020
No, I just... I-I am
invading your space

05:46.022 --> 05:47.772
by being here,
and I just wanted

05:47.774 --> 05:49.240
to do something
nice for you.

05:49.242 --> 05:50.608
For my son.

05:50.610 --> 05:52.660
Okay.

05:52.662 --> 05:54.695
Okay, that's me.
I got to go.

05:54.697 --> 05:56.113
I'll see you later,
all right, sweetheart?

05:56.115 --> 05:57.582
Where, uh...
where are you going?

05:57.584 --> 05:59.667
What's going on?
I'm going to do that thing.

05:59.669 --> 06:01.035
What, uh... what thing?

06:01.037 --> 06:02.837
You know that thing
that I asked you

06:02.839 --> 06:05.673
to do with me but you said
that you couldn't do?

06:05.675 --> 06:07.258
No, no, no. No, no.
Clara?

06:07.260 --> 06:09.210
Yes, Captain.
Oh, call me Lou.

06:09.212 --> 06:10.244
Lou Grover.
All right, Lou.

06:10.246 --> 06:11.745
All right.
What, uh...

06:11.747 --> 06:13.281
What are you doing here, Lou?

06:13.283 --> 06:15.349
McGarrett didn't tell you?

06:15.351 --> 06:16.701
No. Tell me what?

06:16.703 --> 06:18.585
Well, remember
when I asked you

06:18.587 --> 06:20.137
if I could see
what you do

06:20.139 --> 06:21.572
and you said
that I couldn't?

06:21.574 --> 06:23.374
Oh, that's the thing.

06:23.376 --> 06:24.759
Yeah.
Go on a stakeout.

06:24.761 --> 06:26.760
Which I said was a terrible idea.
Right.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.863
So I called your friend
Steve and he said

06:28.865 --> 06:30.615
that he thought it
was perfectly fine,

06:30.617 --> 06:32.216
so he arranged
for me to go

06:32.218 --> 06:34.819
on a ride-along with this
very nice gentleman.

06:34.821 --> 06:36.237
A ride-along?
Yeah.

06:36.239 --> 06:37.872
, we'll see
you late

06:37.874 --> 06:39.023
Okay.

06:39.025 --> 06:41.275
Okay.
Let's go.

06:43.261 --> 06:44.912
All this here you're doing,

06:44.914 --> 06:46.497
that's between you
and McGarrett.

06:51.953 --> 06:55.006
Just stop for
one second, okay?

06:55.008 --> 06:56.924
All I am saying
is that a heads-up

06:56.926 --> 06:58.559
would've been nice. Okay?

06:58.561 --> 06:59.944
That's all.

06:59.946 --> 07:01.612
You're so worked up about this.

07:01.614 --> 07:03.931
Oh, oh, okay, listen, um,
I know this may seem like

07:03.933 --> 07:06.183
a foreign concept to you,
but the idea of my mother

07:06.185 --> 07:08.152
being in harm's way--
it does not sit well with me.

07:08.154 --> 07:09.587
You got to give her
more credit, Danny.

07:09.589 --> 07:11.405
I mean, she survived you.
Ah.

07:11.407 --> 07:13.190
You're not a good friend.

07:13.192 --> 07:15.276
In fact, you're
no longer my friend.

07:15.278 --> 07:16.277
I'm done. Good run.

07:16.279 --> 07:17.795
It's been fun.
You're just mad

07:17.797 --> 07:19.113
because she went
behind your back.

07:19.115 --> 07:20.498
It's got nothing to do with me.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.500
I am mad because she has
all these secret agendas.

07:22.502 --> 07:24.201
Okay, I mean she's always been
very impulsive,

07:24.203 --> 07:25.619
but this is just goofy;
it's crazy.

07:25.621 --> 07:27.288
Thank goodness you're being
levelheaded about it.

07:27.290 --> 07:28.789
You know what?
Go ahead, walk ahead of me.

07:28.791 --> 07:30.157
I don't want to talk
to you anymore.

07:30.159 --> 07:31.492
Walk ahead of you?
Please do.

07:31.494 --> 07:33.644
Hey, heard your mom's going
on a ride-along today.

07:33.646 --> 07:35.763
Oh, that's nice.
Everybody knows but me.

07:35.765 --> 07:37.181
Pay no attention to him.

07:37.183 --> 07:39.300
He woke up on the
wrong side of life.

07:39.302 --> 07:40.634
What do we got here?

07:40.636 --> 07:42.053
We got three vics.

07:42.055 --> 07:44.355
A couple of honeymooners took
a fishing charter this morning.

07:44.357 --> 07:45.690
Coast Guard found their bodies

07:45.692 --> 07:48.059
along with the boat's captain
about an hour ago.

07:48.061 --> 07:50.394
C.O.D.'s multiple
gunshot wounds.

07:50.396 --> 07:52.897
No witnesses so far.

07:52.899 --> 07:54.899
Oh, we're not exactly sure
what that is yet.

07:54.901 --> 07:56.701
Coast Guard
was responding to reports

07:56.703 --> 07:58.486
of a fiery object falling
into the ocean

07:58.488 --> 07:59.653
when they found the boat.

07:59.655 --> 08:00.821
<i>Akualele.</i>

08:00.823 --> 08:01.922
It was a falling star?

08:01.924 --> 08:03.157
Yeah, we're thinking
that the damage

08:03.159 --> 08:04.325
was caused by whatever fell.

08:04.327 --> 08:05.459
Stop. Go back.

08:05.461 --> 08:06.577
Fiery object?

08:06.579 --> 08:07.661
Wait a minute.

08:07.663 --> 08:10.081
If it wasn't a falling star,
what was it?

08:10.083 --> 08:11.198
Still trying to figure that out.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.666
We reached out to the Navy,
but nothing came

08:12.668 --> 08:14.051
across their radar
this morning,

08:14.053 --> 08:15.836
and Coast Guard didn't
find any other debris.

08:15.838 --> 08:17.021
Looks like carbon graphite.

08:17.023 --> 08:19.173
That's what a comet's
made of, right?

08:19.175 --> 08:20.508
No, Danny, that's not
what a comet's made of.

08:20.510 --> 08:22.159
Okay. So, uh, something
falls from the sky,

08:22.161 --> 08:24.345
our three victims end up
with bullets.

08:24.347 --> 08:26.313
I'm assuming this is not
a coincidence, hmm?

08:26.315 --> 08:27.565
Hey, Max.

08:27.567 --> 08:29.984
After a preliminary examination,
I was able to determine

08:29.986 --> 08:33.571
that the time of death
is approximately two hours ago.

08:33.573 --> 08:35.673
All victims have
multiple gunshot wounds.

08:35.674 --> 08:37.890
Many of them
through and through.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.277
CSU was able to recover
several of these.

08:42.164 --> 08:44.198
It's a 7.62 slug.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.001
CSU determined them
to be type M43s.

08:47.003 --> 08:49.870
Chinese and Russian military
use that type of ammo.

08:49.872 --> 08:51.455
We could be looking
at a foreign shooter.

08:51.457 --> 08:52.857
All right, Kono,

08:52.859 --> 08:54.008
notify the Coast Guard.
See if they

08:54.010 --> 08:55.476
can run GPS on
this fishing vessel.

08:55.478 --> 08:57.461
Find out where it was
two hours ago. I want divers

08:57.463 --> 08:59.580
searching a one-mile radius
from wherever that spot is.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.298
If we can find
the rest of this thing,

09:01.300 --> 09:02.767
maybe we can figure out
what it is.

09:02.769 --> 09:05.302
Yeah, you got it.

09:05.304 --> 09:06.804
Yeah. McGarrett.

09:06.806 --> 09:09.640
Don't make any
sudden moves, Commander.

09:09.642 --> 09:11.442
Just be cool

09:11.444 --> 09:17.698
and turn slowly to your left.

09:17.700 --> 09:18.649
Jerry, what are you doing here?

09:18.651 --> 09:19.733
I heard about your shooting

09:19.735 --> 09:21.619
and the falling object
on my police scanner.

09:21.621 --> 09:23.904
Let me guess,
it's carbon graphite?

09:23.906 --> 09:25.289
Stealth technology?

09:26.441 --> 09:29.376
I'll take it by the dead air
that that's a yes.

09:31.214 --> 09:32.463
Hey, let him through.

09:32.465 --> 09:34.748
- He's all right.
- What's going on?

09:34.750 --> 09:36.133
Looks like Jerry
knows something.

09:36.135 --> 09:38.135
This should be good.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.890
My boys.

09:42.892 --> 09:44.425
I missed you guys.

09:44.427 --> 09:46.293
Reunion hug. Bring it in.

09:46.295 --> 09:47.745
All right, Jerry.

09:47.747 --> 09:50.314
Sweet.

09:50.316 --> 09:51.682
Jerry, focus.

09:51.684 --> 09:53.834
What do you know about this?
Gentlemen,

09:53.836 --> 09:56.520
the Black Unicorn has landed
in our backyard.

09:56.522 --> 09:57.988
Black Uni...
another ancient treasure?

09:57.990 --> 09:59.490
Not a sequel, Scully.

09:59.492 --> 10:01.808
It's way better.
What's a Black Unicorn?

10:01.810 --> 10:04.094
A Chinese spy satellite.

10:04.096 --> 10:07.164
Last year, the boys in Beijing

10:07.166 --> 10:09.617
launched two weather satellites
on the same day,

10:09.619 --> 10:12.753
but witnesses on the ground
reported seeing a third object

10:12.755 --> 10:15.005
being sent into space
around the same time

10:16.091 --> 10:17.258
The Black Unicorn.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.844
Exactly.

10:23.431 --> 10:24.632
Appreciate the save.

10:24.634 --> 10:26.600
Anyhow, the Black Unicorn

10:26.602 --> 10:28.853
is a stealthy next-gen
electro-optical

10:28.855 --> 10:30.604
and audio
reconnaissance orbiter.

10:30.606 --> 10:32.189
It makes our KH-12s

10:32.191 --> 10:34.225
look like they're
on training wheels.

10:34.227 --> 10:36.360
Will you speak English
for me, please?

10:36.362 --> 10:38.579
With this thing,
we got no secrets.

10:38.581 --> 10:39.897
NSA can't do
anything about it,

10:39.899 --> 10:41.398
'cause they aren't
even sure it exists.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.068
And China, they denied
ever building it.

10:44.070 --> 10:45.852
But... six months ago,

10:45.854 --> 10:47.872
the Unicorn's schematics
were leaked.

10:47.874 --> 10:49.723
Obviously, I got my paws on 'em.

10:49.725 --> 10:51.825
A few days ago,
I picked up some chatter

10:51.827 --> 10:52.910
that, due to a malfunction,

10:52.912 --> 10:54.211
it was coming down

10:54.213 --> 10:56.530
somewhere in the Pacific.
Okay, so that means that

10:56.532 --> 10:58.048
if our vic saw
this thing go down,

10:58.050 --> 10:59.466
that could be the
reason they're dead.

10:59.468 --> 11:02.303
I don't want to piss off
1.3 billion people, but...

11:02.305 --> 11:03.971
your victims must have
seen the Black Unicorn,

11:03.973 --> 11:05.256
and somebody wanted
to make sure

11:05.258 --> 11:06.590
they didn't live
to tell about it.

11:06.592 --> 11:07.975
Okay, I got
a question.

11:07.977 --> 11:10.144
Um, whatever he's
talking about sounds like

11:10.146 --> 11:12.429
an international incident, no?
So if he knows about it,

11:12.431 --> 11:13.814
don't you think somebody
else knows about it?

11:13.839 --> 11:14.900
It's a fair question.

11:14.901 --> 11:16.767
But Jerry is one for one.

11:16.769 --> 11:18.035
If he's right,

11:18.037 --> 11:20.738
it's a secret worth killing for.

11:31.863 --> 11:34.715
<i>Sorry, Commander,</i>
<i>I think it's more than a reach</i>

11:34.717 --> 11:38.118
to say this came
from a Chinese spy satellite.

11:38.120 --> 11:41.622
I understand, sir-- I'm just
asking for you to look into it.

11:41.624 --> 11:43.674
Well, I can assure you
that won't be necessary.

11:43.676 --> 11:45.476
Not only does
our government track

11:45.478 --> 11:47.578
every satellite launched
across the globe,

11:47.580 --> 11:50.197
but we know months in advance
if one's coming down.

11:51.483 --> 11:53.133
I'm certain all
you're looking at here is

11:53.135 --> 11:55.018
nothing but space junk.
Space junk? You think we're

11:55.020 --> 11:56.303
gonna buy that?
That's the Black Unicorn,

11:56.305 --> 11:57.604
and you know it.
Hey!

11:57.606 --> 12:00.557
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to, son?

12:07.649 --> 12:08.949
All due
respect, sir,

12:08.951 --> 12:11.485
I got three dead bodies,
and you and I both know

12:11.487 --> 12:13.787
they weren't killed
over space junk.

12:13.789 --> 12:15.506
I wish I could help
with your investigation,

12:15.508 --> 12:17.991
Commander.
Now, if you don't mind, I...

12:17.993 --> 12:19.810
I have another appointment.

12:19.812 --> 12:21.378
It'll wait.

12:21.380 --> 12:22.930
Excuse me?

12:22.932 --> 12:24.331
You didn't look up
from that photograph

12:24.333 --> 12:25.966
when you told us
it was space junk, sir.

12:25.968 --> 12:27.617
I think
you're lying.

12:27.619 --> 12:30.287
I think you know exactly what it is.
Now, you listen to me.

12:30.289 --> 12:33.957
I'm not gonna sit here
and be called a liar.

12:33.959 --> 12:36.260
I suggest you get out of here.

12:36.262 --> 12:38.178
Focus on your
murder investigation.

12:38.180 --> 12:40.013
Yes, sir.

12:41.465 --> 12:44.535
If I find out my victims
were killed over this...

12:44.537 --> 12:46.853
you can
be damn sure

12:46.855 --> 12:50.473
I'm gonna be focusing on
a lot more than their murders.

12:53.111 --> 12:55.162
You have a very nice office.

12:55.997 --> 12:58.148
That was awesome.

12:58.150 --> 13:00.117
We totally stuck it to him.

13:00.119 --> 13:01.652
You didn't give him
my last name, did you?

13:01.654 --> 13:03.053
'Cause that would
put me on the list,

13:03.055 --> 13:04.721
and I don't want
to be on that list.

13:04.723 --> 13:06.723
Hey, Jerry, you still got
those Black Unicorn schematics?

13:06.725 --> 13:08.592
Sure. Safe and sound
in my dungeon of truth.

13:08.594 --> 13:10.227
Okay, I need you
to go get them.

13:10.229 --> 13:12.629
If we can match that piece that
we found to those schematics,

13:12.631 --> 13:15.098
we'll know for sure
it's the Black Unicorn.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.466
That'll give us our motive.

13:16.468 --> 13:18.352
You got it, partner.

13:18.354 --> 13:20.437
Too soon?

13:20.439 --> 13:22.222
Little bit.

13:27.979 --> 13:29.780
Postmortem microbial
deterioration activates

13:29.782 --> 13:32.399
the buildup
of metabolic gases

13:32.401 --> 13:34.451
that, combined with
the decomposition

13:34.453 --> 13:36.036
of dermal tissue
slippage,

13:36.038 --> 13:38.205
causes the body
to rise up to the surface,

13:38.207 --> 13:39.923
which is one
of the main reasons

13:39.925 --> 13:41.858
disposing a weighted
body into the ocean

13:41.860 --> 13:43.193
isn't a recommended means

13:43.195 --> 13:45.879
for one trying to get away with murder.
Yes, well,

13:45.881 --> 13:48.799
Dr. Bergman,
that certainly was an education.

13:48.801 --> 13:51.301
Mrs. Williams, it was truly
a pleasure to meet you.

13:51.303 --> 13:53.136
It is quite unfortunate
that Detective Williams

13:53.138 --> 13:56.006
did not inherit
your sparkling disposition.

13:56.008 --> 13:58.208
Well, thank you...
I think, thank you.

13:58.210 --> 14:00.811
Enjoy the rest
of your day.

14:01.896 --> 14:03.647
Do you have any idea
what he just said?

14:03.649 --> 14:05.515
Not a damn clue.

14:06.585 --> 14:09.219
Shall we?
Yes. Let's.

14:12.857 --> 14:14.908
<i>So, Captain,</i>

14:14.910 --> 14:18.362
I really appreciate
you showing me around.

14:18.364 --> 14:21.865
Well...
But I'm a little old for a babysitter.

14:21.867 --> 14:25.085
I mean, I loved going
to the police museum,

14:25.087 --> 14:28.071
and the M.E. was riveting.

14:28.073 --> 14:29.289
But I was kind of hoping

14:29.291 --> 14:32.742
for something, you know,
a little more adventurous.

14:32.744 --> 14:34.678
Well, I hate to
disappoint, but, uh,

14:34.680 --> 14:37.431
me taking you into the middle
of a dangerous situation...

14:37.433 --> 14:39.633
That's not gonna happen?
You know that's not gonna happen.

14:39.635 --> 14:44.021
Not even, like, a sketchy
donut shop or something?

14:44.023 --> 14:48.025
I see where that boy
of yours gets his bite.

14:48.027 --> 14:49.893
What about you,
you got any kids?

14:49.895 --> 14:51.862
Yeah, I got two teenagers.

14:51.864 --> 14:54.364
Mm, yeah, I raised
four of them.

14:54.366 --> 14:56.733
I think the teenage years
are the hardest.

14:56.735 --> 14:58.535
Everybody was always
slamming their doors,

14:58.537 --> 15:00.620
telling me how
I ruined their lives...

15:00.622 --> 15:02.406
Well, see, I don't have
that problem anymore.

15:02.408 --> 15:03.990
No?
I told my daughter

15:03.992 --> 15:06.776
next time she slams her
door, it's coming off.

15:06.778 --> 15:09.496
Ooh. Big mistake.

15:09.498 --> 15:11.264
She can't pay
the mortgage.

15:11.266 --> 15:12.949
My house, my rules.
We only had

15:12.951 --> 15:16.136
one rule in our house,
and that was: Love each other.

15:16.138 --> 15:20.123
And how did that work out?
 One is a fugitive.

15:20.125 --> 15:22.492
Oh...
He's a very nice fugitive.

15:22.494 --> 15:24.294
The other one
is divorced

15:24.296 --> 15:27.314
and living on an island
as far away from his parents

15:27.316 --> 15:29.099
as he can possibly get.

15:29.101 --> 15:33.186
And my two girls,
well, they are...

15:33.188 --> 15:35.638
they're a whole nother story.
Right.

15:35.640 --> 15:36.773
But they got love.

15:36.775 --> 15:38.191
Yeah, they do.
Right. Yeah.

15:38.193 --> 15:41.278
I mean, in hindsight,
maybe a few rules

15:41.280 --> 15:43.280
wouldn't have been so bad.

15:43.282 --> 15:45.866
My husband and I,
we agreed on a softer touch

15:45.868 --> 15:49.202
than we had when
we were growing up.

15:50.088 --> 15:52.255
I get it.

15:52.257 --> 15:54.458
So, you and Danny's father,
you think there's any chance

15:54.460 --> 15:57.260
that the two of you will be
able to work things out?

15:57.262 --> 16:00.597
I don't know. I've been here
for two weeks, and...

16:00.599 --> 16:02.432
he hasn't called.

16:02.434 --> 16:04.634
After 38 years

16:04.636 --> 16:06.720
of marriage, if he
can't pick up the phone,

16:06.722 --> 16:08.472
then what's the point?

16:08.474 --> 16:09.806
Well, come on, now.

16:09.808 --> 16:12.509
You know men, we're
stubborn S.O.B.'s.

16:12.511 --> 16:14.561
We'd rather eat glass
than admit we're wrong

16:14.563 --> 16:15.896
about something.

16:15.898 --> 16:19.032
That's very true.

16:19.034 --> 16:21.868
Clara, you know,
I think you're right.

16:21.870 --> 16:24.020
It's been a
little boring.

16:24.022 --> 16:25.956
But I got just
the thing for you.

16:25.958 --> 16:27.690
I know exactly
where to take you.

16:27.692 --> 16:29.025
Oh, you do?
Mm-hmm.

16:32.765 --> 16:34.697
Hey, how'd it go with the Navy?

16:34.699 --> 16:35.799
They're stonewalling.

16:35.801 --> 16:38.251
I got more of the same
with NSA and Homeland.

16:38.253 --> 16:39.503
What about the Coast Guard?

16:39.505 --> 16:41.304
They find anything?
Nothing on the ocean floor

16:41.306 --> 16:43.406
or the surrounding waters.
But we caught a break.

16:43.408 --> 16:45.225
CSU found a cell phone
on the charter

16:45.227 --> 16:46.593
belonging to the newlyweds.
It was damaged

16:46.595 --> 16:48.545
by a bullet, but Fong
was able to recover video.

16:48.547 --> 16:52.015
Looks like our vic
got an image of the shooter.

16:52.017 --> 16:53.733
Ran it through
facial recognition.

16:53.735 --> 16:57.103
Didn't get any hits, but take
a look at what's behind him.

16:57.105 --> 16:58.622
Salvage equipment
and divers.

16:58.624 --> 17:00.524
No wonder the Coast Guard
didn't find anything.

17:00.526 --> 17:03.610
Okay, so China knew
this satellite was coming down.

17:03.612 --> 17:05.579
They came in to retrieve it
and cover it up.

17:05.580 --> 17:07.063
Our vics were wrong place,
wrong time.

17:07.065 --> 17:09.065
You know, there aren't
many places on the island

17:09.067 --> 17:10.784
that rent boats
with salvage equipment.

17:10.786 --> 17:12.734
Kono and I will
track it down.

17:12.737 --> 17:14.588
So, I just got off
with the consulate general

17:14.589 --> 17:16.006
of the People's Republic
of China.

17:16.008 --> 17:18.290
They denied any knowledge
of the satellite.

17:18.292 --> 17:19.843
Oh, no surprise there.

17:19.845 --> 17:22.579
Look, if our shooter
is a Chinese spy,

17:22.580 --> 17:24.548
maybe Naval Intelligence has him
on their radar.

17:24.550 --> 17:25.848
Catherine, reach out
to your sources.

17:25.851 --> 17:27.717
See if they can help us
I.D. him, okay, off the record.

17:27.719 --> 17:28.918
Got it.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.554
Looks like Jerry
was two for two.

17:39.197 --> 17:41.198
Mom?

17:53.412 --> 17:55.412
Turn around.

17:59.283 --> 18:00.834
I don't know anything.

18:00.836 --> 18:02.052
The satellite schematics.

18:02.054 --> 18:03.503
Schematics? What schematics?

18:04.922 --> 18:06.673
Oh!

18:06.675 --> 18:08.091
The-the Black Unicorn
schematics!

18:08.093 --> 18:10.960
Of course I have those.
Should've been more specific.

18:10.962 --> 18:13.313
I didn't realize that's
what you were referring to.

18:13.315 --> 18:15.765
They're right over here.

18:18.319 --> 18:20.520
Yeah, here they are.

18:31.815 --> 18:34.817
McGarrett, it's Jerry.
You better come quick.

18:34.819 --> 18:36.720
I think I bagged a live one.

18:47.593 --> 18:49.093
Jerry.

18:50.512 --> 18:51.963
What the hell's
going on, Jerry?

18:51.965 --> 18:53.681
Two words: take down.

18:54.203 --> 18:57.888
Actually, four:
totally awesome take down.

18:57.890 --> 19:00.491
She was packing this.

19:00.493 --> 19:01.809
It's a Type 92 pistol,

19:01.811 --> 19:02.976
standard issue,
Chinese military.

19:02.978 --> 19:05.078
But no wallet or I.D.

19:05.080 --> 19:06.847
How do you know that?
I frisked her.

19:06.849 --> 19:08.732
How many times you do that?

19:10.218 --> 19:12.052
I got her prints, too.

19:12.054 --> 19:13.420
Had one of my
contacts run it.

19:13.422 --> 19:16.423
I.D. came back as a
Karen Chou, grad student

19:16.425 --> 19:17.741
here on a visa.

19:17.743 --> 19:19.243
Yeah, right.

19:21.279 --> 19:23.730
My name is Steve McGarrett.
I'm with Five-O,

19:23.732 --> 19:25.899
but you, uh... you probably
already know that.

19:25.901 --> 19:28.085
I'll tell you what we know:
We know that your government

19:28.087 --> 19:29.286
sent you to recover
their satellite.

19:29.288 --> 19:31.104
Okay? So spare me
any denials.

19:31.106 --> 19:33.090
I got three innocent people
who are dead.

19:33.092 --> 19:34.341
You're gonna tell me the names

19:34.343 --> 19:36.293
of all the people
on that boat with you,

19:36.295 --> 19:37.511
starting with this guy.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.668
I had nothing
to do with those murders.

19:45.637 --> 19:47.754
The man's picture you have,

19:47.756 --> 19:49.439
his name is Quan Lung.

19:50.925 --> 19:52.476
He's a traitor to my country.

19:53.978 --> 19:55.212
My name is Zi Chen.

19:55.214 --> 19:56.463
MSS.

19:57.599 --> 19:59.483
Chinese CIA. Cool.

20:00.401 --> 20:03.153
I'll just be right here
if you need me.

20:06.941 --> 20:09.626
I was sent with a
team to stop Quan

20:09.628 --> 20:11.161
and cover up the
satellite's existence,

20:11.163 --> 20:12.546
but he beat us to it.

20:12.548 --> 20:14.614
By the time we got
where it hit the water,

20:14.616 --> 20:15.949
the people were
already dead.

20:15.951 --> 20:17.167
Quan was gone.

20:17.169 --> 20:19.786
He's after the intel
on that satellite.

20:19.788 --> 20:21.621
The onboard hard drive holds

20:21.623 --> 20:24.725
key U.S. military positions
at sea:

20:24.727 --> 20:25.792
submarine deployments,

20:25.794 --> 20:27.311
training exercises.

20:27.313 --> 20:31.231
Information he plans to sell
to one of your enemies.

20:31.233 --> 20:33.934
If he succeeds,

20:33.936 --> 20:36.870
the United States will be
vulnerable to an attack.

20:42.660 --> 20:43.827
Danny, you stay with her.

20:43.829 --> 20:45.579
I'm gonna have DHS come
pick her up.

20:45.581 --> 20:48.048
You're not going to be able
to stop him on your own.

20:48.050 --> 20:50.317
I have a lead

20:50.319 --> 20:52.869
on Quan's base of operations
here on the island.

20:52.871 --> 20:54.654
An address.

20:54.656 --> 20:57.174
I can help you catch him.

20:58.492 --> 21:00.677
But only if we work together.

21:06.834 --> 21:08.468
Just hang in there.

21:08.470 --> 21:09.803
It's almost over.

21:09.805 --> 21:11.972
You, too.

21:12.807 --> 21:14.725
How's Adam doing?

21:14.727 --> 21:17.144
Not good.
His deposition's today.

21:17.146 --> 21:19.613
He and his attorneys
are meeting with the P.A.

21:19.615 --> 21:21.848
He has to give a statement
about Michael's death.

21:21.850 --> 21:23.233
Well, it's just
red tape, cuz.

21:23.235 --> 21:24.985
Everybody knows it
was self-defense.

21:24.987 --> 21:27.471
Yeah, that doesn't mean
it makes it any easier on him.

21:27.473 --> 21:29.890
Aloha.
Hey. Can I help you?

21:29.892 --> 21:32.492
Yeah. Wonder if you
can help us out here.

21:32.494 --> 21:34.628
This guy.

21:34.630 --> 21:35.829
Do you recognize him?

21:35.831 --> 21:37.547
Yeah...

21:37.549 --> 21:40.000
Yeah.
He came by,

21:40.002 --> 21:43.470
uh, earlier today. Rented a boat
with a credit card.

21:43.472 --> 21:44.421
Said he was going

21:44.423 --> 21:45.405
treasure hunting.

21:45.407 --> 21:46.773
It's our guy.
Yeah.

21:46.775 --> 21:48.041
When did he return the boat?

21:48.043 --> 21:50.110
- A few hours ago.
- Did he find  any treasure?

21:50.112 --> 21:51.478
He had something
with him,

21:51.480 --> 21:53.046
but I don't know what it was.

21:54.983 --> 21:58.318
Jerry, Catherine's on her way
over. Bring her up to speed.

21:58.320 --> 22:01.121
Okay? Get in.

22:01.123 --> 22:05.225
Ask her to have her source
at Navy Intel run Zi Chen.

22:05.227 --> 22:07.277
See if they can verify
what she told us.

22:07.279 --> 22:08.412
Catherine? Nice.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.697
I got to go
freshen up.

22:11.565 --> 22:12.732
Hey.

22:12.734 --> 22:14.868
Hmm?
What's with the face?

22:14.870 --> 22:18.121
You don't see how...
incredibly insane this is?

22:18.123 --> 22:20.507
She gave us an address.
We're gonna go check it out.

22:20.509 --> 22:22.676
Right. She gave us an address.
That's my point.

22:22.678 --> 22:25.078
I mean, how do you know
she's not setting us up?

22:25.080 --> 22:26.546
How can I know that
until we check it out?

22:26.548 --> 22:28.799
See, that-that... You just want
to flip a coin and see?

22:28.801 --> 22:30.884
It's insane. Please.
Use your brain, okay?

22:30.886 --> 22:33.437
She's a-a Chinese spy. Okay?

22:33.439 --> 22:34.805
She tried to kill Jerry.

22:34.807 --> 22:37.140
She's potentially responsible
for the...

22:37.142 --> 22:39.226
death of our three victims,
and you just believe her

22:39.228 --> 22:41.311
because she said she's innocent?
"I'm innocent." I...

22:41.313 --> 22:42.963
You bel... I don't get it.

22:42.965 --> 22:44.831
You're still mad at me
about your mom,

22:44.833 --> 22:45.899
aren't you?

22:45.901 --> 22:48.485
There's no helping you.
At all.

22:50.204 --> 22:52.605
Whoa.

22:52.607 --> 22:54.675
Be careful now.
There's a crowd.

22:56.328 --> 22:58.295
All right, watch.

22:59.415 --> 23:00.881
Whoa! Hey, whoa.
What you doing?

23:00.883 --> 23:02.666
You almost took
that old lady's head o

23:02.668 --> 23:07.087
Well, I'm sorry. I thought she
had a Glock 9 behind her bag.

23:07.089 --> 23:08.305
A Glock 9?

23:08.307 --> 23:10.290
Yeah. You didn't think
I was paying attention

23:10.292 --> 23:12.859
at the museum, did you?

23:13.912 --> 23:15.028
Oops.

23:15.030 --> 23:16.546
What do you mean, "Oops"?

23:16.548 --> 23:18.081
Oh! I got him.
Oh!

23:18.083 --> 23:19.566
Good, good, good.
Very good.

23:23.342 --> 23:25.342
All right kid, the moment of truth,
How'd we do?

23:26.358 --> 23:27.657
Lou, you scored
in the 98th percentile.

23:27.659 --> 23:31.111
Show-off.
How did I do?

23:31.113 --> 23:32.195
Bottom third.

23:32.197 --> 23:35.132
But if there was a
metric for looking good

23:35.134 --> 23:38.418
in tac gear, you'd lead
all comers.

23:38.420 --> 23:40.170
I tell you what,

23:40.172 --> 23:42.773
if you ever want to come
back by, give it another try,

23:42.775 --> 23:44.708
- give me a call.
- Okay.

23:44.710 --> 23:46.042
Thank you, Kevin.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.633
I think
I just got hit on.

23:53.635 --> 23:55.936
I believe you did. Yeah.

23:55.938 --> 23:58.004
Hmm.

24:08.399 --> 24:11.918
This is the address.

24:16.357 --> 24:20.243
Let me see your
hands. Hands.

24:20.245 --> 24:22.662
Should we, uh,
call for backup?

24:22.664 --> 24:24.915
Backup?

24:24.917 --> 24:26.299
You're my backup.

24:26.301 --> 24:29.002
Last time you said that,
I got shot in the shoulder.

24:29.004 --> 24:30.370
Could've been worse.

25:32.200 --> 25:35.535
Clandestine meeting with
a top secret government agent?

25:35.537 --> 25:37.487
Bucket, meet list.

25:37.489 --> 25:39.105
Should we pretend
to be a couple?

25:39.107 --> 25:40.624
Uh... you know what?

25:40.626 --> 25:42.209
I don't think that's
gonna be necessary, Jerry.

25:42.211 --> 25:43.610
What about aliases?

25:43.612 --> 25:45.111
Do you use one? Should I?

25:45.113 --> 25:47.047
I... well... here she is.

25:47.049 --> 25:48.215
Vicki.

25:48.217 --> 25:49.549
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

25:49.551 --> 25:51.001
This is Jerry.
Nice to meet you, Jerry.

25:51.003 --> 25:52.785
You, too.

25:52.787 --> 25:54.907
Oh! So, we're just gonna do this
out here in the open.

25:55.723 --> 25:56.956
Don't mind him.

25:56.958 --> 25:58.475
Intel on Zi Chen

25:58.477 --> 26:00.126
and Quan Lung.

26:00.128 --> 26:01.761
Really, really appreciate this.
Thank you.

26:01.763 --> 26:02.729
After Istanbul,

26:02.731 --> 26:03.730
I owe you.

26:03.732 --> 26:05.065
It's good to
see you, Cath.

26:05.067 --> 26:07.183
You, too.

26:10.771 --> 26:12.138
May I?

26:12.140 --> 26:13.957
Knock yourself out.

26:21.549 --> 26:23.416
It's my team.

26:23.418 --> 26:25.702
They must have moved
on the house.

26:25.704 --> 26:26.887
Quan killed them.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.171
It's a good thing

26:28.173 --> 26:29.989
you were at Jerry's, right?

26:29.991 --> 26:31.491
These were not
just people I worked with.

26:31.493 --> 26:32.992
They were my friends.

26:32.994 --> 26:35.095
Hey.

26:35.097 --> 26:36.096
That's it.

26:36.098 --> 26:38.014
Hard drive's gone.

26:38.016 --> 26:40.300
C4, looks like
he was making a bomb.

26:40.302 --> 26:41.851
A bomb?

26:41.853 --> 26:43.436
That's good.
What's he making it for?

26:43.438 --> 26:45.338
Wait, wait!
Don't touch!

26:46.507 --> 26:48.108
Nobody move.

27:10.414 --> 27:12.415
Danny?

27:12.417 --> 27:14.551
We got to get out of here.

27:29.900 --> 27:31.984
Let's clear all the
houses next door.

27:31.986 --> 27:34.320
Get the bomb guys suited up
and get them in there.

27:34.322 --> 27:36.622
Hi, Ma.

27:36.624 --> 27:39.075
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm okay. I'm fine.

27:39.077 --> 27:41.377
This doesn't happen
all the time, does it?

27:41.379 --> 27:42.578
No, this never happens.

27:42.580 --> 27:43.813
Yeah, you're
a really bad liar.

27:43.815 --> 27:46.015
Ma, you can't, uh...
you can't be here.

27:46.017 --> 27:47.950
Buddy, hey, do me a favor.
Oh, come on.

27:47.952 --> 27:49.585
Uh, show her your
police car, all right?

27:49.587 --> 27:51.036
Ma, it's not safe.
Please? You got to go.

27:51.038 --> 27:53.105
I've seen a police car.
I understand. See another one.

27:53.107 --> 27:54.590
What the hell's
the matter with you?

27:54.592 --> 27:55.808
I asked her to stay in the car.

27:55.810 --> 27:57.093
What do you want me to do?

28:42.005 --> 28:43.439
Clear!

28:43.441 --> 28:46.242
Okay, we're all clear in there.

28:46.244 --> 28:47.810
So, I figure we
ought to get

28:47.812 --> 28:49.178
you guys a Five-O Grover signal.

28:49.180 --> 28:51.981
That way, you can just throw it
up in the sky when you need me.

28:51.983 --> 28:54.650
Oh, trust me, nobody wants
to see your name in lights.

28:54.652 --> 28:57.436
Yeah, and nobody on the planet
wants to see you in tights.

28:57.438 --> 28:58.738
Oh, I'll settle
for just a cape.

28:58.740 --> 28:59.739
A cape? Okay, Batman.

28:59.741 --> 29:00.706
Please take care of my mom.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.274
Please?
Like she was my own.

29:02.276 --> 29:04.427
Thank you.

29:07.548 --> 29:09.832
Now do you believe me?

29:09.834 --> 29:11.283
Quan knew I'd come here.

29:11.285 --> 29:13.169
He rigged their bodies to make
sure I wouldn't stop him.

29:13.171 --> 29:15.171
All right, well,
now that he thinks you're dead,

29:15.173 --> 29:16.556
we got the advantage,
don't we?

29:16.558 --> 29:18.724
Yeah, Catherine,
what do you got?

29:25.298 --> 29:27.132
No, no. Thanks.

29:27.134 --> 29:28.734
Got something
you want to tell us?

29:28.736 --> 29:31.571
Do you have something
you want to tell us?!

29:31.573 --> 29:33.606
You see, her and Quan,
they didn't just work together.

29:33.608 --> 29:35.541
Isn't that right?

29:35.543 --> 29:36.993
Isn't that right? Tell him.

29:39.363 --> 29:40.830
Quan and I were engaged.

29:40.832 --> 29:42.248
Really?

29:42.250 --> 29:43.499
Now, if I told you

29:43.501 --> 29:45.368
about our relationship,
I knew you would never trust me.

29:45.370 --> 29:47.286
That's correct.
I didn't trust you before.

29:47.288 --> 29:48.454
That bomb was meant for me.

29:48.456 --> 29:49.538
See, that usually happens

29:49.540 --> 29:50.573
after the marriage, no?

29:50.575 --> 29:52.725
Yeah, I know
how it looks.

29:52.727 --> 29:54.777
But I'm telling you the truth.

29:54.779 --> 29:57.613
Quan betrayed me.

29:57.615 --> 29:59.882
Now, he was always talking
about the hypocrisy in China.

29:59.884 --> 30:02.001
A socialist state making
billions off the West

30:02.003 --> 30:03.269
while our people got hungry.

30:03.271 --> 30:05.938
But I knew he was really
talking about himself.

30:05.940 --> 30:08.457
Two months ago, he learned
the satellite was coming down.

30:08.459 --> 30:09.942
Told me we could retrieve it.

30:09.944 --> 30:12.028
Sell the information.

30:12.030 --> 30:14.013
With that money,
we could leave China.

30:14.015 --> 30:16.065
Now, he said he was
doing it for us.

30:16.067 --> 30:18.517
But I told him I would
never betray our country.

30:18.519 --> 30:19.702
Okay, so why didn't
you turn him in?

30:19.704 --> 30:22.154
I never thought he
would really do it.

30:23.740 --> 30:27.093
Then he disappeared a
week ago, and I knew.

30:27.095 --> 30:30.079
MSS holds me responsible.

30:30.081 --> 30:33.249
It was my duty to stop this
from happening, and I didn't.

30:33.251 --> 30:35.551
If I don't stop him, they'll
charge me with treason.

30:35.553 --> 30:38.254
And they won't just go after me;
they'll go after my family.

30:38.256 --> 30:40.205
Tell us how to find him.

30:40.207 --> 30:42.341
I need access to a computer.

30:42.343 --> 30:43.909
Why?
72 hours ago,

30:43.911 --> 30:45.428
we intercepted a
communication

30:45.430 --> 30:48.197
between Quan and an unknown
IP address in Chechnya.

30:48.199 --> 30:50.316
MSS thinks a terrorist
organization

30:50.318 --> 30:51.984
is trying to buy
the satellite data

30:51.986 --> 30:53.653
to launch an attack
against the U.S.

30:54.722 --> 30:56.322
And you thought
you'd just, uh, hang on

30:56.324 --> 30:57.907
to that information,
that little bit of intel

30:57.909 --> 30:59.075
as a bargaining chip?

31:00.327 --> 31:01.327
Chin.

31:01.329 --> 31:02.662
Steve, we tried the credit card

31:02.664 --> 31:03.879
that Quan used to rent the boat.

31:03.881 --> 31:06.949
He had dinner at a hotel
in Kahala last night.

31:06.951 --> 31:08.250
And he wasn't alone.

31:08.252 --> 31:09.952
Who was he with?

31:09.954 --> 31:12.872
A hotel guest by the name
of Umar Basayev.

31:12.874 --> 31:14.540
A waiter I.D.'d both of them.

31:14.542 --> 31:15.524
We checked him out.

31:15.526 --> 31:16.959
He's a Chechen businessman.

31:16.961 --> 31:18.744
He flew into Oahu 48 hours ago.

31:18.746 --> 31:20.763
Okay, good. He's our buyer.
Where is he now?

31:20.765 --> 31:23.015
Front desk said he left
just before we showed up.

31:23.017 --> 31:24.016
But here's the thing.

31:24.018 --> 31:25.017
He hasn't checked out.

31:25.019 --> 31:26.686
Fine. Stay on the hotel.

31:26.688 --> 31:28.304
We'll keep working
on the location of the buy.

31:28.306 --> 31:30.556
Copy that.

31:30.558 --> 31:33.359
Your intel on the Chechen
connection's good.

31:33.361 --> 31:34.643
You believe me?

31:34.645 --> 31:35.978
Yeah, for now. Come on.

31:36.863 --> 31:39.031
Let's go.

31:50.944 --> 31:55.831
I thought that I wanted to know
what Daniel does for a living,

31:55.833 --> 31:57.950
and now I kind of wish
that I didn't.

31:57.952 --> 31:59.085
You sound like my wife.

31:59.087 --> 32:01.170
She shares the exact
same sentiment.

32:01.172 --> 32:02.438
Here we go, crime fighters.

32:04.225 --> 32:07.176
You got heaven
all in garlic sauce.

32:07.178 --> 32:09.528
You won't find <i>grinz</i> like that
on the Jersey Shore.

32:09.530 --> 32:13.215
It looks fantastic,
smells great.

32:13.217 --> 32:14.850
Tell me something, auntie.

32:14.852 --> 32:16.318
That boy of yours--

32:16.320 --> 32:18.821
how come he didn't inherit
your beautiful smile?

32:18.823 --> 32:20.239
Wow.

32:20.241 --> 32:21.707
Food and flattery.

32:21.709 --> 32:23.242
I have just be a regular.

32:23.244 --> 32:24.360
Mission accomplished.

32:26.330 --> 32:29.314
Well, that's the second time
you've been hit on today.

32:29.316 --> 32:31.117
Oh, he was just
being sweet.

32:31.119 --> 32:32.585
I don't know.

32:32.587 --> 32:34.036
Don't sell yourself short.

32:34.038 --> 32:37.656
Lou, I just want
to thank you so much for today.

32:37.658 --> 32:39.592
I mean, I asked you
for an adventure,

32:39.594 --> 32:41.544
and you sure gave me one.

32:41.546 --> 32:44.497
It was fun.
I had a good time, too, Clara.

32:44.499 --> 32:46.682
Sorry.

32:48.802 --> 32:51.220
Hello?

32:51.222 --> 32:53.272
Oh. Hi.

32:54.675 --> 32:57.760
Yeah, coffee?

32:57.762 --> 33:00.646
Sure. I'm free later.

33:02.650 --> 33:04.784
Okay. Okay. Bye-bye.

33:07.154 --> 33:10.039
That was Kevin
from the shooting place.

33:10.041 --> 33:12.658
Oh.
He just asked me out.

33:12.660 --> 33:13.959
On a date?

33:15.796 --> 33:17.880
I wonder how he got my number.

33:17.882 --> 33:20.633
You mind passing
the hot sauce, Clara?

33:23.003 --> 33:24.637
<i>Hey.</i>

33:24.639 --> 33:26.388
So, I dug into Umar Basayev,

33:26.390 --> 33:28.724
and, uh, on the surface,
he appears to be pretty clean,

33:28.726 --> 33:30.342
but his business--
importing rugs

33:30.344 --> 33:32.478
from all over the Middle East
to Russia--

33:32.480 --> 33:34.713
has been the subject
of multiple investigations.

33:34.715 --> 33:37.549
In 2011,
his organization was linked

33:37.551 --> 33:39.018
to an al-Qaeda front,
but there was never

33:39.020 --> 33:40.853
any evidence to
make it stick.

33:40.855 --> 33:43.555
So, you show us the
communication he sent to Quan.

33:45.376 --> 33:47.893
MSS e-mail server?

33:47.895 --> 33:50.229
Any chance
you'd share your password?

33:51.932 --> 33:53.499
Sorry about the whole
stun gun thing.

33:53.501 --> 33:55.901
In fairness, I thought
you were there to kill me.

33:56.937 --> 33:58.921
Here it is.

33:58.923 --> 33:59.955
Look at that.

33:59.957 --> 34:01.907
We got "Proof of data."

34:01.909 --> 34:04.243
"3:00 p.m. At the tailor."

34:04.245 --> 34:06.061
We should have no
problem finding him now.

34:06.063 --> 34:08.264
All right, it's 2:45. You said
MSS intel went over this?

34:08.266 --> 34:09.965
What was their
takeaway?

34:09.967 --> 34:12.301
We ran it through analysis,
found nothing embedded.

34:12.303 --> 34:13.686
Research came back

34:13.688 --> 34:16.420
with 84 tailor-related
businesses on the island.

34:16.422 --> 34:17.922
Ooh. What if

34:17.925 --> 34:20.192
tailor isn't a profession,
but a person?

34:20.194 --> 34:21.726
There's an arcade downtown.

34:21.728 --> 34:22.811
The owner, Mikel Taylor,

34:22.813 --> 34:24.429
is a real scary
Russian dude.

34:24.431 --> 34:25.981
Definitely ex-KGB.

34:27.784 --> 34:30.268
Looks like Mikel Taylor's

34:30.271 --> 34:32.705
been on the FBI watch list
since the '70s.

34:32.706 --> 34:35.224
If this is our guy, he's got
to be brokering the deal.

34:35.226 --> 34:37.042
Where downtown is this arcade?
Queen Street.

34:37.043 --> 34:39.210
Catherine, notify Grover,
have SWAT meet us on site.

34:39.213 --> 34:40.779
And please, uh,
tell him to leave my mom

34:40.781 --> 34:43.114
at home.
Got it.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.657
Let's go.

34:51.659 --> 34:52.757
All right.

34:52.760 --> 34:53.742
Get in.

34:53.744 --> 34:56.011
Get in.
I want to go in.

34:56.013 --> 34:57.179
Give me your hands.

34:59.149 --> 35:01.951
Quan would rather die
than surrender to you.

35:01.953 --> 35:03.652
I'm expecting that.

35:04.854 --> 35:07.523
Lou, what do we know?

35:07.525 --> 35:08.857
Well, shop's closed.

35:08.859 --> 35:11.160
I got thermal that confirms
at least seven possible

35:11.162 --> 35:12.528
bad guys inside.

35:12.530 --> 35:13.996
Where's my mom?

35:13.998 --> 35:15.848
She's in a van tacking up.

35:15.850 --> 35:17.199
That's funny.

35:17.201 --> 35:19.818
Relax. She's with a friend
of mine, Kevin, from HPD.

35:19.820 --> 35:21.260
He'll get her home safe.
Don't worry.

35:22.038 --> 35:24.290
Let's go.
Who's Kevin?

35:42.475 --> 35:43.809
Five-O!

36:12.826 --> 36:14.627
He's got the hard drive!

37:33.241 --> 37:37.578
Danny, I need an ambulance,
alleyway off Queen and Alakea.

37:59.150 --> 38:01.969
I spoke to the DOD,

38:01.971 --> 38:04.588
and they reached out to
the Chinese Ambassador.

38:06.090 --> 38:07.274
We've arranged for you

38:07.276 --> 38:09.993
and the bodies of your team
to be returned home.

38:11.563 --> 38:13.730
And the hard drive?

38:13.732 --> 38:16.733
We tried to retrieve the intel,
but it's been destroyed.

38:16.735 --> 38:19.069
You should take it.

38:19.071 --> 38:22.456
That's proof your
mission was a success.

38:25.577 --> 38:27.461
You didn't have to help me.

38:27.463 --> 38:31.932
No, I didn't, but I know what
it's like to serve my country.

38:38.090 --> 38:41.341
He didn't give you a choice.

38:47.782 --> 38:51.235
In my culture,
respect is a virtue.

38:51.237 --> 38:53.854
You have mine,
Commander McGarrett.

38:55.491 --> 38:57.624
Xiè xie.

38:58.443 --> 39:00.294
Thank you.

39:10.772 --> 39:12.773
He's at the third bench,

39:12.775 --> 39:14.007
100 yards up.

39:16.044 --> 39:17.711
Sorry about the
runaround earlier.

39:17.713 --> 39:19.179
Nothing personal.

39:40.818 --> 39:43.370
Catherine Rollins
recovered the intel.

39:43.372 --> 39:45.789
It's all there.

39:45.791 --> 39:47.741
What about the hard drive?

39:47.743 --> 39:49.626
Erased.

39:49.628 --> 39:51.411
I returned it to Agent Chen.

39:51.413 --> 39:53.863
And she believed we were unable
to retrieve the data?

39:53.865 --> 39:55.232
That's correct.

39:55.234 --> 39:58.151
You've done your country
a great service, Commander.

39:58.153 --> 39:59.753
We now know what
the enemy knows,

39:59.755 --> 40:01.972
and we can adjust accordingly.

40:01.974 --> 40:03.724
Job well done.

40:05.460 --> 40:08.762
Three innocent people
lost their lives over this one.

40:10.648 --> 40:12.599
Make it count.

40:29.467 --> 40:32.202
What's going on, Jerry?

40:32.204 --> 40:33.770
I can't go back home.

40:34.589 --> 40:36.089
Why not?

40:36.091 --> 40:38.625
I stun-gunned a Chinese spy
in my mom's basement.

40:38.627 --> 40:40.677
I could be facing

40:40.679 --> 40:41.928
some serious retaliation.

40:41.930 --> 40:43.130
Jerry, the threat's
been neutralized.

40:43.132 --> 40:44.131
You're completely safe.

40:44.133 --> 40:46.633
You have no idea
how this works, do you?

40:47.986 --> 40:50.137
I need to lie low for a while.

40:50.139 --> 40:52.439
I sent my mom
to her sister's, and I...

40:52.441 --> 40:54.975
thought I'd stay with you.

40:54.977 --> 40:58.528
You know,
just till this dies down.

41:02.099 --> 41:03.784
Huh.

41:03.786 --> 41:06.136
Okay.

41:06.138 --> 41:07.537
Sweet.

41:07.539 --> 41:09.539
We're going over
some ground rules first, Jerry.

41:10.842 --> 41:13.710
Whatever you say, roomie.

41:28.393 --> 41:30.510
Hi.

41:31.462 --> 41:33.063
What are you doing up?

41:33.065 --> 41:35.315
"What am I doing up?"
Is that a joke?

41:35.317 --> 41:38.185
You didn't have to wait
up for me, you know.

41:38.187 --> 41:39.820
I know, I know, but...

41:39.822 --> 41:42.155
as strange as it is
for me to say the words,

41:42.157 --> 41:43.407
"my mother's on a date,"

41:43.409 --> 41:45.242
when my mother's on a date,
I-I wait up.

41:46.978 --> 41:48.945
Well, I appreciate that,
sweetheart,

41:48.947 --> 41:51.915
but it really wasn't a big deal.

41:51.917 --> 41:53.450
What, was he a jerk?

41:53.452 --> 41:54.984
No, not at all. Here.

41:54.986 --> 41:56.336
Oh.

41:56.338 --> 41:57.838
'Cause if he was,
I'll find him

41:57.840 --> 41:59.423
and bounce his head
off the sidewalk.

42:00.659 --> 42:03.593
Daniel, he was really
a perfect gentleman.

42:03.595 --> 42:05.595
Okay.

42:05.597 --> 42:07.381
What's with the ice cream?

42:09.166 --> 42:12.185
At first, I thought it
would be really exciting

42:12.187 --> 42:14.504
to be on a date
with another man.

42:15.723 --> 42:19.226
And don't get me wrong--
it was nice to have somebody

42:19.228 --> 42:22.312
look at me that way
again, you know?

42:24.149 --> 42:26.700
But it was strange

42:26.702 --> 42:28.902
and kind of weird.

42:28.904 --> 42:30.454
Yeah.

42:30.456 --> 42:31.905
Yeah, well, I know why.

42:31.907 --> 42:35.242
Because it wasn't...
it wasn't with Pop, you know?

42:36.026 --> 42:38.662
Yeah, I know.

42:41.917 --> 42:43.333
Yeah.
Yeah, come on.

42:43.335 --> 42:45.535
Let's watch a movie.
Okay.
