00:33.336 --> 00:35.065
- Hi. Hi, hi.
- Hey.

00:35.205 --> 00:36.297
- You must be...
- Bill.

00:36.439 --> 00:37.428
- Yeah.
- Hi.

00:37.574 --> 00:39.474
Hi. Becky. Hi.

00:40.777 --> 00:44.713
Thanks for having dinner so early.
I know it's... it's a pain.

00:44.848 --> 00:47.282
No, that's, that's...

00:48.185 --> 00:49.846
Interesting crowd.

00:51.321 --> 00:53.186
Yeah. My job is the problem.

00:53.323 --> 00:55.120
I'm... I work at
Good Morning, New Jersey and...

00:55.258 --> 00:58.352
- Right, on channel nine. Right?
- Right. Yeah.

00:58.495 --> 01:01.953
So, yeah, we're on really early, so I...
I go to bed really early and

01:02.098 --> 01:05.295
we used to be on at, 5am,
but then we got bought by this

01:05.435 --> 01:07.665
giant company and they wanted
to run us instead of infomercials.

01:07.804 --> 01:10.830
'Cause we generate
slightly more revenue and...

01:10.974 --> 01:12.703
Now we're on at four.

01:13.777 --> 01:16.678
Sorry, I'm gonna turn this off.
It's so...

01:16.813 --> 01:20.647
Sorry. That's like, oh, my God,
that's so annoying

01:20.784 --> 01:22.877
when people do this.
It's like, "check, please."

01:24.221 --> 01:28.715
I'm not gonna touch this...
ever again. Sorry.

01:28.859 --> 01:32.727
No, that's, it's... it's OK.

01:32.863 --> 01:33.921
It's OK.

01:36.399 --> 01:37.559
I...

01:37.701 --> 01:40.465
I'm... I'm really glad that
you picked this place. I...

01:40.604 --> 01:44.506
You know, it kind of reminds me
of Matthews in Waldwick.

01:44.641 --> 01:48.168
They have the most amazing, like,
delicious, thick, big, juicy...

01:49.179 --> 01:52.615
Lots of Belgian waffles
and syrup in the...

01:53.750 --> 01:54.876
And...

01:56.720 --> 01:59.951
Anyway... boring!

02:01.224 --> 02:02.691
What do you do?

02:02.826 --> 02:04.384
- Anna told me you're in...
- Marketing.

02:04.527 --> 02:06.222
- Right.
- For an insurance company,

02:06.363 --> 02:10.299
and I dabble in ceramics, but...

02:11.001 --> 02:12.434
Take it.

02:13.403 --> 02:17.032
Sorry, it's... I... This is my boss.

02:17.173 --> 02:18.970
- Go ahead. Take it.
- Really?

02:19.109 --> 02:21.134
- Yeah.
- OK, great, thanks.

02:21.278 --> 02:22.905
Just be a sec. Promise.

02:23.046 --> 02:25.879
Hi! Yeah, yeah.

02:26.016 --> 02:28.348
I left three messages
for his attorney. I don't know.

02:28.485 --> 02:31.249
If he doesn't call me back, I'm gonna...
I'll wait outside his office.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.397
- Good morning, Becky.
- 'Night, Jim.

02:45.535 --> 02:48.197
Good morning, New Jersey,
it's 2am.

02:48.338 --> 02:50.602
We cover the Garden State
from corner to corner.

02:50.740 --> 02:53.106
...the perfect alternative...

02:56.212 --> 02:58.737
New Jersey Transit is reporting
a 20-minute delay...

02:58.882 --> 03:01.612
...come out in support
of your local eateries.

03:01.751 --> 03:02.979
Powerball Lottery jackpot...

03:03.119 --> 03:04.484
Right in the base...

03:04.621 --> 03:07.351
Yes, but I did it in
a really adorable way.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.788
Rent a mini-rig. Cheaper and we can
get closer to the action.

03:09.926 --> 03:12.156
I was thinking we'd get someone
in the winner's circle.

03:12.295 --> 03:13.489
A pinata?
You can do the pinata?

03:13.630 --> 03:15.029
- I can do it.
- Yeah? OK.

03:17.067 --> 03:19.092
- Four... three...
- Thank you, thank you.

03:30.080 --> 03:32.810
Ready to dissolve to jib.
Jib, ready to make your move.

03:32.949 --> 03:34.940
Ten seconds to air,
everybody.

03:35.085 --> 03:37.781
Ready to roll track
and fade up under one.

03:37.921 --> 03:40.651
...three, two... one.

03:40.790 --> 03:42.280
Roll track and fade up under one.

03:46.997 --> 03:49.295
Good morning, New Jersey.
4:38 if you're just waking up.

03:49.432 --> 03:50.956
A quick look at traffic now.

03:51.101 --> 03:53.296
Holland Tunnel is backed up
'cause of an overturned big rig

03:53.436 --> 03:54.562
in the right and center lanes.

03:54.704 --> 03:58.162
Officials say this should be cleared up
in about an hour.

03:58.308 --> 04:00.435
So then, expect delays
from Ridgefield Park.

04:00.577 --> 04:02.841
- But until then, you should...
- Is that snoring?

04:02.979 --> 04:05.243
Jesus. Not again. Can you
go to the single of Ralph?

04:05.382 --> 04:06.644
- Harry, Harry.
- The Deko!

04:06.783 --> 04:08.216
- Wrong lower third!
- The Deko!

04:08.351 --> 04:11.582
...the hidden dangers
that could be in your home.

04:11.721 --> 04:14.849
All that and a look at sports
at the top of the hour.

04:14.991 --> 04:16.583
Stick with us here
at Good Morning, New Jersey.

04:16.726 --> 04:17.886
Oh, my God.

04:18.028 --> 04:19.928
- Nice shot. You're a stud.
- No problemo.

04:20.063 --> 04:22.361
Rain will fall
when you go to the mall

04:22.499 --> 04:24.865
Later will clear,
the sun will appear

04:25.001 --> 04:27.196
Overnight low is 50
Move your rear

04:27.337 --> 04:29.362
Hey, ho, whoo

04:30.106 --> 04:31.368
- Hey.
- Hi.

04:31.508 --> 04:34.841
Hey, I talked to Raymond in HR.
He said the company's reorganizing

04:34.978 --> 04:39.438
all the stations and they've budgeted
us for a new senior producer.

04:40.517 --> 04:44.214
They pulled your employment records.
You're getting it, Becky.

04:44.354 --> 04:46.754
You're finally getting the job.

04:49.626 --> 04:53.187
Hey, kiddo, can you come by my office
after the show?

04:53.329 --> 04:56.162
- Oh, me.
- No, not me, you.

04:57.067 --> 04:58.056
Yes.

05:02.639 --> 05:06.541
The puppy, a Chinese crested is worth
over $600 and answers to the...

05:06.676 --> 05:08.371
Make your move, jib,
make your move...

05:08.511 --> 05:11.708
And in Newark today,
police arrested 12 members of...

05:20.657 --> 05:22.989
What? What's going on?
What is that?

05:23.126 --> 05:24.991
We thought you might need this.

05:25.128 --> 05:27.756
That better not be a box of condoms
again and I didn't even use the old one.

05:27.897 --> 05:30.058
No, you're gonna use this.

05:33.069 --> 05:34.058
Oh, my God.

05:34.204 --> 05:35.728
- Congratulations.
- Congrats.

05:35.872 --> 05:37.237
That's so sweet.

05:46.850 --> 05:49.375
Becky, we have to let you go.

05:49.519 --> 05:52.079
I'm really sorry about this, kiddo.

05:52.222 --> 05:54.782
Corporate wants us
to reduce our overhead.

05:54.924 --> 05:58.416
We're having to make big cuts and they
want me to hire a senior producer

05:58.561 --> 06:01.291
with more business experience to
manage the contraction of the show.

06:01.431 --> 06:03.661
But wait a second. You told them
you can't do that, right?

06:03.800 --> 06:06.928
Because I... I've been here so long
and I've worked so hard.

06:07.070 --> 06:08.833
His name is Chip.

06:08.972 --> 06:12.533
He's... Chip starts Monday.

06:12.675 --> 06:15.735
He has an M.B.A. And
a journalism degree from Columbia.

06:15.879 --> 06:19.440
They're grooming him to run
the whole station in a few years.

06:19.582 --> 06:24.747
In the meantime, I can't afford
to keep you both.

06:26.189 --> 06:28.817
- Becky, look, I'm really...
- Oh, shit.

06:28.958 --> 06:32.951
Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit.
Shitty...

06:33.096 --> 06:36.998
Becky, I... I'm so sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

06:37.133 --> 06:40.296
- I fought them as hard as I could.
- There's lots of terrific

06:40.436 --> 06:44.338
opportunities out there, you know?
I mean, look at Chip. He got one.

06:44.474 --> 06:47.375
So maybe this is just the push
I need, you know?

06:47.510 --> 06:50.809
So it can get me to the next level,
maybe even to a network or...

06:50.947 --> 06:53.177
- Yeah.
- I mean, it's not like

06:53.316 --> 06:56.046
it's my whole life.
It's only work, right?

07:01.858 --> 07:03.951
Did you get any severance?

07:06.729 --> 07:08.924
There were some budgetary cuts
last year,

07:09.065 --> 07:12.034
so they weren't really offering.

07:12.235 --> 07:15.136
But I have feelers out. Lots.

07:15.271 --> 07:17.535
- Yeah, great.
- Honey, you think the Today show

07:17.674 --> 07:20.700
is gonna call you up and hand you a job,
you have since you were eight,

07:20.843 --> 07:23.778
- and it's not gonna happen.
- I don't, I know that, I do, I get it.

07:23.913 --> 07:27.371
This is partly my fault. I...

07:27.517 --> 07:31.248
I let your father get your hopes up.

07:31.387 --> 07:35.756
He was not a happy person,
let's face it.

07:35.892 --> 07:38.759
When he saw you aim high, he started
to feel better about himself,

07:38.895 --> 07:41.489
- so I never said anything.
- What are you saying?

07:41.631 --> 07:44.225
You had a dream, you know? Great.

07:44.367 --> 07:47.131
When you were eight, it was adorable.

07:47.270 --> 07:50.103
When you were 18, it was inspiring.

07:50.240 --> 07:53.801
At 28, it's officially embarrassing.

07:55.044 --> 07:59.481
And I just want you to stop
before we get to heartbreaking.

08:24.007 --> 08:25.474
The troops are involved in projects...

08:25.608 --> 08:27.473
Waiting arrival...

08:29.045 --> 08:31.570
On my BlackBerry,
it shows that you got my e-mail,

08:31.714 --> 08:36.150
so I was just wondering if... Yeah,
it shows when someone's opened it.

08:36.285 --> 08:37.275
Hello?

08:37.419 --> 08:38.717
Becky Fuller. Yeah.

08:38.855 --> 08:41.722
I wanted to make sure that you got
the resume that I e-mailed you.

08:41.857 --> 08:42.847
You did. Great.

08:42.991 --> 08:45.961
Becky Fuller again.
I was just wondering if...

08:46.729 --> 08:48.629
Yes, I did call yesterday,
but I updated my resume last night

08:48.765 --> 08:49.789
and thought you might...

08:49.932 --> 08:53.095
I'm calling because I was
checking up on the position

08:53.236 --> 08:55.033
and I was wondering if it had been...

09:00.176 --> 09:02.041
- Hi, Becky Fuller.
- Hi.

09:02.178 --> 09:05.341
Hi, this is Jerry Barnes calling
from IBS in New York. How are you?

09:06.182 --> 09:08.480
- Good.
- Terrific. Listen, I'm calling

09:08.618 --> 09:12.554
'cause I received your resume,
all five of them, actually.

09:12.689 --> 09:13.883
And it just so happens,

09:14.023 --> 09:16.321
that we're looking for somebody
at the moment.

09:16.459 --> 09:17.653
I'll take it.

09:17.794 --> 09:20.160
Well, wait, I haven't
told you what it is yet.

09:20.296 --> 09:22.025
- Sorry.
- Well, our morning show

09:22.165 --> 09:23.792
- has a vacancy and so...
- I'll take it!

09:23.933 --> 09:27.130
We're interviewing a bunch of people.
Maybe you can come in

09:27.270 --> 09:28.760
- and we can have a talk.
- Sure! Absolutely.

09:28.905 --> 09:31.669
Just tell me where to go
and who to talk to.

09:31.808 --> 09:35.209
OK, I'll get you an e-mail with the
details of where we are in the city.

09:35.345 --> 09:37.336
- Sorry!
- And shall we say 3:00?

09:37.480 --> 09:38.879
Thank you, thank you!

09:54.230 --> 09:57.791
Oscar says you're very talented
and you work incredibly hard.

09:57.934 --> 10:01.836
Says you're the most promising
producer that he's ever fired.

10:01.971 --> 10:05.236
Well, that's, that's good. I think.

10:05.608 --> 10:07.439
So you're a fan
of our morning program?

10:07.577 --> 10:11.536
- Yeah, I think it has so many...
- Yeah, yeah, we know it's terrible.

10:11.681 --> 10:15.777
Perpetually in fourth place behind
the Today show, Good Morning America

10:15.918 --> 10:17.852
and that thing on CBS,
whatever it's called.

10:17.987 --> 10:20.319
It's a source of constant humiliation.

10:20.456 --> 10:24.051
Last year, in the network softball
league, the CBS team wore hats

10:24.193 --> 10:25.956
that said,
"At least we're not Daybreak."

10:26.095 --> 10:30.862
The anchors of the show
are difficult and semi-talented.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.332
- I think Colleen Peck is a pro.
- Heinous.

10:34.036 --> 10:37.199
- Paul McVee is a fine reporter.
- Foul.

10:38.608 --> 10:42.408
OK. Is Daybreak a shitty show? Yes.

10:42.545 --> 10:45.946
But it's on a network.
And not just any network.

10:46.082 --> 10:49.415
This is one of the most legendary
news divisions in the entire history

10:49.552 --> 10:52.043
of television! Daybreak just needs
someone who believes in it,

10:52.188 --> 10:55.419
who understands that a national
platform is an invaluable resource,

10:55.558 --> 10:59.324
that no story is too low
or too high to reach for!

10:59.729 --> 11:02.562
Are you gonna... sing?

11:03.800 --> 11:06.360
Look, Mr. Barnes. Jerry.

11:06.502 --> 11:08.970
Daybreak's facilities are antiquated.

11:09.105 --> 11:13.098
It's understaffed, underfunded.
And the pay.

11:13.576 --> 11:14.565
It's awful, about half

11:14.710 --> 11:16.678
of what you made at
Hey, How The Hell Are You, New Jersey?

11:16.813 --> 11:20.271
You've never been an
executive producer. You're too young.

11:20.416 --> 11:24.682
Nobody's ever heard of ya. And here,
your education, three, not four years,

11:24.821 --> 11:26.789
at Fairleigh Dickinson in Teaneck,

11:26.923 --> 11:31.383
also known as Fairly Ridiculous.
Did I miss anything?

11:34.230 --> 11:37.097
Daybreak needs what I need,

11:37.233 --> 11:39.497
someone who believes
that it can succeed.

11:39.635 --> 11:42.695
Trust me, I know you don't
have any reason to believe in me,

11:42.839 --> 11:45.399
but I work harder than anyone else.

11:45.541 --> 11:47.133
I'm in first, I'm out last.

11:47.276 --> 11:49.904
I know a shitload more about the news
than someone whose daddy paid them

11:50.046 --> 11:52.446
to smoke bongs
and talk semiotics at Harvard

11:52.582 --> 11:55.608
and I devote myself completely
to my job. It's what I do.

11:55.751 --> 11:58.117
It's all I am. I...

11:59.355 --> 12:01.186
You can ask anyone.

12:02.425 --> 12:06.828
Well, that's... embarrassing.

12:10.199 --> 12:12.190
OK.

12:12.935 --> 12:14.459
Thanks for the tour,

12:14.604 --> 12:19.701
and... thanks for... for...

12:19.842 --> 12:21.241
Thanks.

12:34.657 --> 12:37.182
It's these buttons right here.

12:37.326 --> 12:40.887
Oh, lobby. Yes, thanks.

12:43.199 --> 12:45.133
Good day so far?

12:46.168 --> 12:48.602
I don't think so.

12:48.738 --> 12:51.332
I talked too much. Ruined it.

12:53.276 --> 12:54.538
Damn it.

13:04.820 --> 13:06.447
Sir.

13:08.758 --> 13:10.885
I am such a huge admirer of yours.

13:11.027 --> 13:15.225
I'm a... I'm a big, huge fan. I...

13:15.364 --> 13:18.162
My whole family watched you,
growing up. I...

13:18.301 --> 13:22.362
Of all the anchors, you were,
by far, the greatest reporter.

13:22.505 --> 13:26.066
I mean when you were
in Kosovo, I was in Kosovo.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.608
- She work for you?
- No.

13:28.744 --> 13:31.042
I'm just here to teach her
how to use the elevator.

13:31.180 --> 13:32.340
Are you done?

13:33.282 --> 13:35.716
Yes, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:35.851 --> 13:37.341
May I?

13:37.486 --> 13:38.578
Oh, God, sorry. I...

13:38.721 --> 13:41.019
Of course, of course.

13:41.157 --> 13:43.318
Oh, my God, I can't
believe I just met the...

13:43.459 --> 13:45.620
- Wait a second. You know him.
- Yes, I do know him.

13:45.761 --> 13:48.457
He's the third worst person
in the world.

14:06.616 --> 14:09.278
- Hello?
- Becky Fuller.

14:09.418 --> 14:12.182
- Yes?
- You sure you can do this job?

14:12.321 --> 14:13.754
Yes.

14:13.889 --> 14:16.687
- You start on Monday.
- Thank you.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.927
Yes, I am calling about
the one-bedroom.

14:28.070 --> 14:31.506
Yes, I'm moving into town.
I've got a new job.

14:31.641 --> 14:32.972
I'm extremely neat and tidy.

14:34.443 --> 14:36.934
In summer camp the kids used
to pay me to make their beds.

14:37.079 --> 14:39.547
Yeah.
Sorry, that was an overshare.

14:39.682 --> 14:41.343
No loud music. No kids.

14:41.484 --> 14:43.816
I don't even have a boyfriend.
Just me.

14:43.953 --> 14:45.978
I'll take it. I'll take it,
I'll take it.

15:01.437 --> 15:03.064
Sorry!

15:04.774 --> 15:06.469
Sorry!

15:08.044 --> 15:09.636
Sorry!

15:23.492 --> 15:25.756
Also, we'll have more
on the flooding in Iowa.

15:25.895 --> 15:28.693
Finally, some good weather news
on the way for those folks.

15:28.831 --> 15:31.664
So please join us tomorrow
and thank you for spending

15:31.801 --> 15:34.235
- your morning here at Daybreak.
- Take care, everyone.

15:34.370 --> 15:36.463
- Are you interviewing at Daybreak?
- Goodbye.

15:36.605 --> 15:38.402
Assistant? Intern?

15:39.108 --> 15:41.872
No. Actually,
I'm the new executive producer.

15:42.011 --> 15:43.478
Another one?

15:46.816 --> 15:48.113
Don't unpack.

15:49.652 --> 15:52.212
Miss Fuller?
Lenny Bergman, Senior Producer.

15:52.354 --> 15:55.152
Yes. I know who you are.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.953
You started out at WABC.
You were at CBS for two years

15:58.094 --> 16:00.324
- and here for 13.
- Yeah, wow.

16:00.463 --> 16:03.261
- Here, let me, let me give you a hand.
- I just have one question.

16:03.399 --> 16:05.833
Why haven't they bumped you up?

16:05.968 --> 16:08.766
It's not for me. I did it
for a couple of weeks once,

16:08.904 --> 16:12.362
but they put me back at number two.
Apparently, the crying was distracting.

16:12.508 --> 16:14.237
You'll love it, though.
It's a great job.

16:14.376 --> 16:18.039
- Our morning meetings are at five.
- Isn't that kind of late?

16:18.180 --> 16:20.478
- Late?
- I mean, it's just that...

16:20.616 --> 16:24.108
I'm, I'm used to early hours, so...

16:24.253 --> 16:26.949
Well, maybe we should
try better doughnuts.

16:27.089 --> 16:30.058
Excuse me. At the Today show,

16:30.192 --> 16:32.558
the senior staff is usually...
Hi... in by 4:30...

16:32.695 --> 16:35.391
We're just like the Today show,
except, you know, without the money,

16:35.531 --> 16:37.795
- viewers, respect. But very similar.
- OK.

16:37.933 --> 16:42.632
OK? That's...
that's one of our good doorknobs.

16:42.772 --> 16:44.103
Let me take care of this.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.607
Colleen Peck has been here forever.
Don't mention that.

16:47.743 --> 16:50.405
But McVee is paid more.
Don't mention that, either.

16:50.546 --> 16:52.138
They hate each other.
Don't mention that.

16:52.281 --> 16:55.114
But that's because Colleen hates
everybody. Don't mention that.

16:55.251 --> 16:58.550
And she used to sleep with McVee,
who threw her over for her assistant.

16:58.687 --> 17:00.086
- Do not mention that.
- Got it.

17:00.222 --> 17:01.951
- After you talk to Colleen...
- Yeah, yeah?

17:02.091 --> 17:05.219
Make sure you get me before you talk
to McVee, so I can go with ya.

17:05.361 --> 17:08.728
- Why?
- I don't... Just trust me, OK?

17:08.864 --> 17:10.354
- OK.
- OK.

17:10.499 --> 17:11.522
- OK.
- Good.

17:11.666 --> 17:14.464
- Can I just...
- Sure. OK, you ready?

17:14.603 --> 17:16.263
- I'm ready.
- Good luck.

17:23.112 --> 17:25.637
Do you know how many EP's I've had
in the past 11 years?

17:27.683 --> 17:28.980
Fourteen.

17:29.118 --> 17:32.053
If they're stupid, they get fired,
and if they're smart, they quit.

17:32.188 --> 17:34.679
And now look what I get.

17:36.826 --> 17:37.815
Well...

17:38.494 --> 17:40.155
- It's a pleasure...
- You think it's fun being

17:40.296 --> 17:42.491
in last place?
Do you think I enjoy working

17:42.631 --> 17:45.794
for a network that spends more
on one episode of a dating show

17:45.935 --> 17:48.301
about a bachelor dwarf
than our entire weekly budget?

17:48.437 --> 17:50.871
- No...
- And I've never had a decent

17:51.006 --> 17:53.338
- co-anchor ever!
- We're gonna change...

17:53.475 --> 17:58.538
Just a revolving door of cretinous
morons. Our ratings are in the crapper.

17:58.681 --> 18:02.082
I mean, how long can this show
limp along like this?

18:02.218 --> 18:05.312
I know that everyone's been through
a lot, and I know that there's been

18:05.454 --> 18:07.319
so many challenges along the way.
But, you know...

18:07.456 --> 18:09.583
You will fail like everyone else

18:09.725 --> 18:12.216
and then you'll be gone,
like everyone else.

18:12.361 --> 18:16.320
But I will still be here, pulling
the train up the hill with my teeth.

18:16.465 --> 18:18.262
You think it's fun
getting your ass kicked?

18:18.400 --> 18:20.265
- No...
- Welcome to Daybreak.

18:20.402 --> 18:23.200
Enjoy the pain, Gidget.

18:24.640 --> 18:28.041
No! It's OK. I have it!
I've done this a zillion times and...

18:28.177 --> 18:30.270
- I'm gonna fix that and...
- See ya later!

18:30.412 --> 18:31.640
Good talking to you.

18:35.517 --> 18:39.749
Paul! Hi! I'm... I'm Becky Fuller.

18:39.889 --> 18:43.518
Your new EP. Thrilled to meet you.

18:43.659 --> 18:46.719
I was just thinking maybe we could
go over a few ideas.

18:46.862 --> 18:47.988
I was thinking maybe we could

18:48.130 --> 18:50.189
get you on the street
and do some remotes.

18:50.332 --> 18:53.699
Yeah, I don't like to leave the studio.
I like climate control.

18:53.836 --> 18:58.796
But, if you want, we could
discuss this further privately.

19:00.843 --> 19:02.606
What size are your feet?

19:02.745 --> 19:04.770
- You wear about a six and half? Seven?
- Pardon?

19:04.914 --> 19:07.781
How do you feel about
having them photographed?

19:07.917 --> 19:10.852
Good? Feel good about that?

19:10.986 --> 19:12.544
You should.
I keep 'em very classy.

19:12.688 --> 19:14.588
I... don't...

19:14.723 --> 19:16.782
Can I show you my blog?
"Sexy Feet?"

19:16.926 --> 19:18.553
- No.
- Yes?

19:18.694 --> 19:19.752
No.

19:19.895 --> 19:21.487
- I met Paul.
- You talked to him alone?

19:21.630 --> 19:23.530
- I told you to come see me first.
- I know, but...

19:23.666 --> 19:27.500
What was I gonna do?
Hi, everyone. Hi, I'm Becky.

19:27.636 --> 19:29.194
Hi. Good morning.

19:29.338 --> 19:33.297
Oh, God, look who's here.
I mean not here.

19:33.442 --> 19:35.137
McVee. So shocking, huh?

19:35.277 --> 19:39.145
Yeah, well, Mr. McVee doesn't
always come to these things.

19:39.281 --> 19:43.149
Oh, could you tell Paul
that we need him, please? Thanks.

19:43.285 --> 19:46.049
OK, so let's just dive in,
shall we?

19:47.589 --> 19:48.988
Who wants to start?

19:49.124 --> 19:50.785
Tomorrow Rocco DiSpirito
wants to make lasagna.

19:50.926 --> 19:52.985
I told him we did that last week
with the Barefoot Contessa,

19:53.128 --> 19:55.596
- but he's insisting. What do I do?
- For the segment on miniskirts,

19:55.731 --> 19:58.427
- do you want all size models?
- Next week, I want to do a piece

19:58.567 --> 20:00.398
on juice cleanses.
All the celebs are doing them

20:00.536 --> 20:02.504
and they have amazing
powers of rejuvenization.

20:02.638 --> 20:05.198
My idea is that I get a juice
cleanse and then we can, like,

20:05.341 --> 20:07.707
- measure my toxins...
- For the Carville interview...

20:07.843 --> 20:10.141
I'm sorry, Lisa, do you want
the living room set or the stools?

20:10.279 --> 20:12.713
ABC says we can't have Eva Longoria
until two weeks after

20:12.848 --> 20:14.782
- she does G.M.A. What do we do?
- On psychic animals,

20:14.917 --> 20:16.714
would you prefer a parakeet
or an iguana?

20:16.852 --> 20:18.877
I'd like to do a piece on weathervanes.
They are fascinating.

20:19.021 --> 20:21.489
Like did you know the word "vane"
comes from the Old English "fana",

20:21.623 --> 20:24.649
- which means flag or weathercock?
- Friday, for cooking with squash,

20:24.793 --> 20:26.886
- inside or on the plaza?
- They're offering us the third

20:27.029 --> 20:28.963
lead in the new Patrick Dempsey movie.
Do you want him?

20:29.098 --> 20:31.066
Great story out of Tampa about
a retirement account scandal.

20:31.200 --> 20:33.293
But we got to move quick. Should we
send a team or just local talent?

20:33.435 --> 20:35.198
...control room's on the fritz.
Ten grand to fix it.

20:35.337 --> 20:38.306
For that piece on baby food,
do we want an actual baby,

20:38.440 --> 20:40.840
and if so, white, black,
Hispanic, Asian,

20:40.976 --> 20:43.467
blonde hair, brown hair,
teeth, or no teeth?

20:43.612 --> 20:45.512
I have a black baby at home.

20:49.518 --> 20:52.043
I'm sorry, I can't hear
what you're saying. I...

20:52.187 --> 20:54.951
Hello! Hi, hi. Does someone
wanna tell me why I had to log off

20:55.090 --> 20:56.990
BangingGrannies.com for this?

20:58.494 --> 20:59.756
Asshole.

21:06.068 --> 21:08.730
Tell Rocco if he insists on making
lasagna, he will be bumped.

21:08.871 --> 21:11.999
Yes, all size models,
but skirts not too short. Toxins?

21:12.141 --> 21:13.768
Who said that?
They can't be measured.

21:13.909 --> 21:17.276
And "rejuvenization," not a word.
Tell Longoria's people

21:17.413 --> 21:20.439
that she can't plug her next film unless
we get her within a week of G.M.A.

21:20.582 --> 21:23.073
Parakeet. Ernie, weathercock?
Seriously?

21:23.218 --> 21:25.015
The plaza for squash.
I want Patrick Dempsey.

21:25.154 --> 21:27.281
Tell his people we'll run him in
the first hour and he can talk about

21:27.423 --> 21:29.914
whatever his thing is.
Tampa Bay, definitely local talent.

21:30.059 --> 21:31.686
And we've got to fix that sound board.

21:31.827 --> 21:33.089
Find ten grand
in the budget somewhere.

21:33.228 --> 21:35.093
The hair and makeup numbers, those
were too high. So, Colleen, could you

21:35.230 --> 21:36.857
share your hair person with Lisa?

21:36.999 --> 21:39.524
That'd be great, great. OK.
Asian baby, no teeth.

21:39.668 --> 21:40.726
- Lesbian parents.
- OK.

21:40.869 --> 21:42.894
Did I miss anything?

21:43.038 --> 21:45.370
Oh, Paul!

21:48.177 --> 21:49.371
You're fired.

21:50.479 --> 21:53.380
- You're adorable.
- Fired!

22:05.894 --> 22:08.226
I'm sorry. That was unprofessional.

22:14.570 --> 22:17.368
Congratulations. The first day,
you flushed your anchor

22:17.506 --> 22:19.167
and you got no money
to pay for another one.

22:19.308 --> 22:21.276
He was lowering the morale of the show.

22:21.410 --> 22:22.968
How is that possible?

22:23.112 --> 22:25.171
Look, you must have
someone under contract.

22:25.314 --> 22:27.908
A local anchor, a reporter.
I'll find someone.

22:28.050 --> 22:30.484
I'll promote from within.
That'll be great for morale!

22:30.619 --> 22:33.884
Go nuts. Find somebody great.
It just can't cost me a penny.

22:34.623 --> 22:37.091
What if I gave them one
of my three pennies?

22:37.226 --> 22:40.559
Whatever it takes.
Just get the ratings up.

22:45.868 --> 22:50.168
Lenny, hi. Yeah. Very positive.
He thinks we have terrific options.

22:50.305 --> 22:53.103
...plunge from 200 points
right before closing.

22:53.242 --> 22:56.507
- Analysts fear that this...
- He's not bad.

22:56.645 --> 22:59.842
Yeah, he's OK. Put a saddle on him,
he's good to go.

22:59.982 --> 23:03.611
...are not happy.
- Should we watch 86 again?

23:03.752 --> 23:07.848
I got to get home, see the kids,
or the wife is gonna kill me.

23:07.990 --> 23:09.423
You have kids?

23:10.225 --> 23:12.455
What? No.

23:12.594 --> 23:14.459
No? Husband? Boyfriend?

23:15.230 --> 23:17.698
Me? What? No.

23:17.833 --> 23:20.734
- No, I'm sorry. Stupid question.
- You know...

23:20.869 --> 23:23.861
- You're hideous and repulsive.
- You know what? Forget 86.

23:24.006 --> 23:28.136
I think that we should watch the Miami
guy again, 'cause he was, I mean,

23:28.277 --> 23:30.507
you know, he was a little bit tan,
but I think...

23:30.646 --> 23:32.477
I think that we could wipe
that off, it's probably

23:32.614 --> 23:36.345
just one of those self-tanner things.
I could, you know, fix that.

23:37.352 --> 23:38.717
Good night.

23:39.588 --> 23:42.284
Hey, look. It's Mike Pomeroy's fangirl.

23:44.560 --> 23:45.822
- Hello.
- Hey.

23:45.961 --> 23:47.019
That was you.

23:47.162 --> 23:49.357
That was really embarrassing.

23:50.199 --> 23:52.360
I may need to have you killed.

23:53.702 --> 23:56.170
I'm... I'm Becky Fuller. Sorry.

23:56.305 --> 23:57.795
"Becky Fuller" Becky Fuller?

23:57.940 --> 24:00.875
The one who took out McVee?
You're a legend already.

24:01.009 --> 24:03.000
- Thanks.
- I'm Adam Bennett.

24:03.145 --> 24:04.840
I'm a producer upstairs at Seven Days.

24:04.980 --> 24:07.107
- Hello.
- So you lookin' for a new anchor?

24:07.249 --> 24:09.774
- Yes.
- Not that guy.

24:09.918 --> 24:11.943
You can't use that guy.
That's the horse guy.

24:12.087 --> 24:14.783
He's not too bad. I mean,
as long as we leave our hand flat

24:14.923 --> 24:17.050
when we feed him a carrot.

24:17.192 --> 24:21.788
- Well, good luck, Becky Fuller.
- Thank you, Adam Bennett.

24:21.930 --> 24:25.730
- Need any help?
- No. I'm good. Thanks.

24:26.935 --> 24:30.371
The sports guy from St. Louis
is not bad. Let's watch him again.

24:30.505 --> 24:33.906
No, we need some gravitas.
We need people to trust us.

24:34.042 --> 24:37.876
I mean, if news breaks on the air, we
need to be able to cover it credibly.

24:38.013 --> 24:41.540
What, do you actually think
that we can cover breaking news?

24:41.683 --> 24:44.277
- God, that's adorable.
- Thousands gathered today

24:44.419 --> 24:47.547
to see if the tiny buck-toothed creature
would spot his own shadow.

24:47.689 --> 24:50.749
But the sad tooth is,
according to Punxsutawney Phil,

24:50.892 --> 24:55.386
this bitter winter is far from over.
Back to you, Mike.

24:58.834 --> 24:59.926
What?

25:00.068 --> 25:03.037
Yesterday, the Secretary of State
held a top-level

25:03.171 --> 25:05.196
- State Department security brief...
- What's funny?

25:05.340 --> 25:08.309
- You put Seabiscuit back in?
- But we agree that Hezbollah

25:08.443 --> 25:11.241
has shown a willingness
to continue to attack.

25:11.380 --> 25:14.076
- Becky?
- Can I call you back?

25:14.216 --> 25:16.582
...lsraeli incursions.

25:16.718 --> 25:22.156
What steps are you taking to limit
these Hezbollah retaliations?

25:22.291 --> 25:24.088
You have Pomeroy
under contract, right?

25:25.093 --> 25:28.927
Yeah. He was supposed to do
stories for one of our magazine shows.

25:29.064 --> 25:30.929
- Yeah?
- We couldn't use anything he pitched.

25:31.066 --> 25:33.261
- Nothing?
- An eight-part story

25:33.402 --> 25:36.667
on the United Nations.
An interview with a Pashtun warlord.

25:36.805 --> 25:41.367
A piece on microfinance in Asia?
It's all been so tempting.

25:41.510 --> 25:43.535
- Jerry!
- So we're just paying him to sit there.

25:43.679 --> 25:46.375
Wait. But he must
have millions on his contract.

25:46.515 --> 25:48.813
You have a world-caliber
news man with nothing to do!

25:48.950 --> 25:50.884
- Becky, this is...
- No, Pomeroy has reported

25:51.019 --> 25:55.115
on every major story of the last three
decades, with integrity and courage!

25:55.257 --> 25:58.283
I mean, he was the only anchor to go
down to Ground Zero on the day.

25:58.427 --> 26:00.657
His Q ratings, I looked at them,
they're unbelievable,

26:00.796 --> 26:04.323
- and you're already paying him.
- I have to go. We'll discuss this.

26:04.466 --> 26:05.933
I...

26:06.068 --> 26:08.161
I want to look at his contract!

26:08.303 --> 26:10.464
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Hi.

26:10.605 --> 26:15.133
I need your approval
to look at his contract.

26:16.211 --> 26:18.042
Please.

26:44.339 --> 26:46.569
Hi.

26:46.708 --> 26:48.141
Hi.

26:50.312 --> 26:52.246
I'm Becky Fuller and...

26:52.381 --> 26:55.077
We actually met the other day
in the elevator.

26:55.217 --> 26:58.050
And what the hell are you doing here?

26:58.186 --> 27:01.952
I'm the producer of Daybreak and we're
actually looking for a new anchor.

27:03.325 --> 27:05.259
Then why are you here?

27:05.394 --> 27:07.385
Well, it's funny that you should ask.

27:07.529 --> 27:10.293
Go away.

27:10.432 --> 27:13.595
OK, just hear me out, because the
show actually has a lot of potential.

27:13.735 --> 27:15.032
We're starting over basically,

27:15.170 --> 27:17.695
and with an anchor as esteemed
and respected as yourself...

27:25.213 --> 27:28.148
You've been a journalist
your whole life, ever since

27:28.283 --> 27:30.342
your elementary school paper,
The Beaverton Bee.

27:30.485 --> 27:33.852
I mean, you've got to miss it. You...
News breaks, it must just kill you

27:33.989 --> 27:37.584
- not to be out there.
- Morning shows don't do news.

27:37.726 --> 27:42.288
Jesus, Daybreak. Half the people that
watch your show have lost their remote.

27:42.431 --> 27:45.662
The other half are waiting
for their nurse to turn them over.

27:45.801 --> 27:49.259
If I wanted to come back,
I could have any job I chose.

27:49.404 --> 27:52.100
But you can't work on another network
for another two years.

27:52.240 --> 27:56.506
So I'll continue to enjoy my life
on IBS's dime.

27:56.645 --> 27:58.738
All right,
I didn't want to have to do this.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.348
- I looked at your contract.
- What?

28:01.483 --> 28:03.849
- With the lawyers.
- My contract?

28:03.985 --> 28:06.852
You're right. They do have to pay you
for the last two years of your contract.

28:06.988 --> 28:08.387
Unless six months have elapsed

28:08.523 --> 28:10.354
without you appearing on the air
in any capacity.

28:10.492 --> 28:12.824
Then, if the network offers
you an official position

28:12.961 --> 28:15.452
and you don't take it,
they can terminate your contract

28:15.597 --> 28:18.157
and the six million dollars
that you have left on it.

28:18.300 --> 28:21.497
So, here's me with an official offer.

28:21.636 --> 28:25.333
Mike Pomeroy, the IBS network
would like to offer you

28:25.474 --> 28:27.942
the position of co-host of Daybreak.

28:31.580 --> 28:34.743
- You're joking.
- No.

28:34.883 --> 28:36.214
Actually, I'm not.

28:37.285 --> 28:39.412
Do you have any idea
what's going on in the world?

28:39.554 --> 28:43.684
And you want me to do stories
about baked Alaska?

28:43.825 --> 28:46.020
After the career that I've had?

28:47.128 --> 28:48.925
You just need to have an open mind.

28:49.064 --> 28:50.497
- Open mind.
- I mean, yes, the morning news

28:50.632 --> 28:54.090
- has a wider range of stories...
- A wider range?!

28:54.236 --> 28:57.694
Your program is in the
news department, you cretin!

28:57.839 --> 29:00.740
News is a sacred temple.

29:00.876 --> 29:04.903
And you're part of the cabal
that's ruining it with horseshit!

29:05.046 --> 29:06.411
That's not actually fair.

29:06.548 --> 29:09.813
Because the first half hour of a morning
show is a damn fine news broadcast.

29:09.951 --> 29:11.578
Sure, we cover news and entertainment.

29:11.720 --> 29:13.312
That's everything
a newspaper has ever done.

29:13.455 --> 29:15.514
There's nothing wrong with that.
Think of it this way:

29:15.657 --> 29:17.557
We're like a well-informed neighbor,
coming over to chat

29:17.692 --> 29:20.957
with people in the morning. You know,
Brokaw did the morning news.

29:21.096 --> 29:23.621
And Charlie Gibson. Walter Cronkite
did it at the beginning of his career.

29:23.765 --> 29:26.825
I mean, he co-hosted a morning program
with a puppet named Charlemagne.

29:28.203 --> 29:31.400
Well, then... get a puppet.

29:34.342 --> 29:38.278
It's inexpensive and uses things
you already have around the house.

29:38.413 --> 29:42.941
You can make globes, hats,
especially pinatas.

29:43.084 --> 29:45.609
Now, mache means
"to chew" in French,

29:45.754 --> 29:49.747
but we're not actually going
to be eating any of this, right?

29:51.259 --> 29:52.248
Of course not!

29:52.394 --> 29:54.225
No.

29:54.362 --> 29:56.626
Coming up next, you've heard her sing.

29:56.765 --> 29:59.393
Well, today, you're going
to hear about her sweet tooth.

29:59.534 --> 30:03.903
Join us as we bake brownies
with Celine Dion's personal chef.

30:04.039 --> 30:07.270
All that and more,
coming up on Daybreak.

30:07.409 --> 30:08.740
- We're clear!
- Oh, my God,

30:08.877 --> 30:12.108
will somebody please get this off?
Thank you, thank you.

30:12.247 --> 30:14.442
- Thank you very much.
- OK, so, we don't have time

30:14.583 --> 30:16.915
for the sit-down, so we're just
gonna run the package, all right?

30:17.052 --> 30:19.612
- Are you OK?
- What?

30:19.754 --> 30:23.417
Don't beat yourself up.
He was never gonna do it. Pomeroy?

30:23.558 --> 30:26.322
- How did you know that?
- Mike was never gonna come to work

30:26.461 --> 30:29.157
at this little dog and pony show,
especially not working for somebody

30:29.297 --> 30:31.492
- like, well, I'm sorry, but you.
- OK. Like, yeah.

30:31.633 --> 30:35.069
You. Not in a thousand years. I mean,
obviously, don't get me wrong,

30:35.203 --> 30:40.140
I would have... I would have
welcomed him with open arms.

30:40.275 --> 30:41.799
Oh, my God.

30:49.317 --> 30:51.911
I heard he was coming in,
but I didn't...

31:00.962 --> 31:03.453
I've won eight Peabodys.

31:03.598 --> 31:05.088
A Pulitzer.

31:05.233 --> 31:07.997
Sixteen Emmys.

31:08.136 --> 31:11.264
I was shot through
the forearm in Bosnia.

31:11.406 --> 31:15.103
Pulled Colin Powell from a burning Jeep.

31:15.243 --> 31:19.612
I laid a cool washcloth
on Mother Teresa's forehead

31:19.748 --> 31:22.273
during a cholera epidemic.

31:22.417 --> 31:26.217
I've had lunch with Dick Cheney.

31:28.156 --> 31:30.317
You're here for the money.

31:32.327 --> 31:34.090
That is correct.

31:35.597 --> 31:38.498
Five, four, three...

31:38.967 --> 31:39.956
Fuck.

31:40.969 --> 31:42.129
Welcome back to Daybreak.

31:42.270 --> 31:44.898
God, does he cook?
Does he do... I don't know,

31:45.040 --> 31:46.337
fashion segments and gossip?

31:46.474 --> 31:50.001
Does he have three-year-old octuplets
barf all over him like I did last year?

31:50.145 --> 31:51.578
Well, unfortunately, in the '80s,

31:51.713 --> 31:53.408
someone gave him
story refusal rights, so no.

31:53.548 --> 31:56.073
I don't care. Does he know that
this is called morning television?

31:56.217 --> 31:58.276
Yes, and I think
that after a little bit of time,

31:58.420 --> 32:00.388
he's really gonna want
to do a mix of stories.

32:00.522 --> 32:03.457
Face it! I'm going to end up making
turkey meatballs with Mario Batali

32:03.591 --> 32:07.049
- for the rest of my natural life.
- I need the new titles ASAP.

32:07.195 --> 32:10.221
OK, let's move it. Single malt. We've
got the hand soap,

32:10.365 --> 32:12.765
we got the mixers, the papers,
the tropical fruit.

32:12.901 --> 32:14.766
Here we go.
Whoever heard of mangosteen?

32:14.903 --> 32:18.168
- Apparently, he has.
- This is Colleen's dressing room

32:18.306 --> 32:23.334
and... She's so looking
forward to seeing you.

32:23.478 --> 32:25.810
Good. Great. Glad to hear it.

32:27.148 --> 32:30.276
And this is mine?

32:30.418 --> 32:34.616
Yes, but Colleen is... Never mind.

32:35.256 --> 32:36.883
You got me the newspapers?

32:37.025 --> 32:38.515
The mixers?

32:39.527 --> 32:41.995
The tropical fruit plate.

32:42.130 --> 32:45.861
All stipulated in your ten-page rider.

32:46.835 --> 32:49.998
- Nice of you.
- Yes...

32:50.138 --> 32:54.302
Colleen wants me, I'll be in here.

32:56.377 --> 32:57.366
OK.

33:01.516 --> 33:05.714
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
He should come in here.

33:08.456 --> 33:11.220
- OK.
- What the hell is that?

33:11.359 --> 33:13.520
No hurry.

33:15.196 --> 33:16.663
No. No and no.

33:19.434 --> 33:20.423
OK.

33:20.568 --> 33:23.799
Did you tell her I have papaya in here?

33:23.938 --> 33:29.001
He gets a tropical fruit plate?
That is just so pathetic.

33:30.311 --> 33:31.642
That guy might be our only hope.

33:31.780 --> 33:35.216
So I suggest you just man up
and get in there!

33:35.350 --> 33:37.580
That is such a good speech!

33:37.719 --> 33:40.847
Guess what? I'm not going.

33:49.798 --> 33:52.858
So, we'll be shooting Mike's
promos all week and then

33:53.001 --> 33:54.593
we'll finalize the format
of the show on Friday.

33:54.736 --> 33:56.704
Then we'll rehearse
Mike's openings and segues.

33:56.838 --> 34:00.296
Excuse me.
Who is going to say goodbye?

34:01.743 --> 34:04.803
- Pardon?
- Well, at the end of the show?

34:06.414 --> 34:07.574
It doesn't really matter.

34:07.715 --> 34:10.114
I mean, Mike, you don't mind
if Colleen says goodbye?

34:10.251 --> 34:13.049
Well, who do you think the public
would rather hear from last?

34:13.188 --> 34:17.625
Someone who's won every broadcast
award on the face of the planet

34:17.759 --> 34:21.525
or the former Miss Pacoima?

34:21.663 --> 34:24.029
It's Arizona!

34:24.199 --> 34:27.134
In case you're interested,
I was Miss Arizona!

34:29.771 --> 34:31.398
Christ!

34:37.946 --> 34:40.676
We can't both have our arms folded.

34:40.815 --> 34:42.543
And I am the female here, I think.

34:42.684 --> 34:45.380
- Colleen on this side.
- Of course, I'd be more than happy to.

34:53.695 --> 34:56.664
Can you just step away,
just for a second? Thanks.

34:56.797 --> 34:59.926
We don't want
to take up your precious... Hello?!

35:00.068 --> 35:04.095
- Is that better?
- What's next? Bubble bath?

35:06.808 --> 35:08.298
Hey. Hi!

35:09.711 --> 35:11.736
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.440
Hey, I just came to...
to offer my condolences

35:14.582 --> 35:17.881
on hiring the third
worst person in the world.

35:20.054 --> 35:21.544
Thanks.

35:21.689 --> 35:26.422
Yes. I...
Who are the other two?

35:26.928 --> 35:31.331
Kim Jong-il
and Angela Lansbury, actually.

35:31.466 --> 35:34.458
- She knows what she did.
- OK.

35:34.602 --> 35:39.301
So, I... I gather that you worked
with Mike at the nightly news.

35:39.440 --> 35:42.637
Worst year of my life.
The entire time we worked together,

35:42.777 --> 35:46.042
the only thing he ever called me
was Senor Dipshit.

35:47.582 --> 35:48.571
It's not funny.

35:48.716 --> 35:49.842
- I'm sorry, that's not funny.
- No.

35:49.984 --> 35:52.214
That's terrible.
That is terrible, actually.

35:52.353 --> 35:54.446
Yeah, so...

35:54.589 --> 35:57.319
So now is an excellent time
for you to take up drinking.

35:57.458 --> 36:00.894
And... And I came by to say
that sometimes after work,

36:01.029 --> 36:03.156
a few of us go over
to Schiller's on Madison,

36:03.298 --> 36:07.735
so, you know,
if you're ever around...

36:07.869 --> 36:10.463
- Around.
- Yeah, available.

36:10.605 --> 36:15.838
Oh, OK. Yeah.
That... would be nice.

36:15.977 --> 36:19.572
Yeah, I... I don't,
I don't really go out very much,

36:19.714 --> 36:22.080
but if I'm in the neighborhood,

36:22.216 --> 36:24.912
- I will definitely stop by and say hi.
- Well, like tomorrow.

36:25.053 --> 36:27.954
- Around eight.
- OK. Yeah, sounds good.

36:28.089 --> 36:29.750
- All right.
- Sure, yeah.

36:31.025 --> 36:33.084
- Bye.
- Bye.

36:33.227 --> 36:36.060
That's not too shabby.
You got a new anchor.

36:36.197 --> 36:40.657
Somebody asked you out on a date.
Things are lookin' up.

36:40.802 --> 36:43.464
That was... He...
Not asking me out on a date.

36:43.604 --> 36:45.538
I think it was.
I was standin' right there.

36:45.673 --> 36:47.504
- No, no.
- Yeah.

36:47.642 --> 36:51.009
He was just mentioning that
he might be somewhere. I mean...

36:51.145 --> 36:54.478
Come on, please, I think I would
know if I was being asked out on a date.

36:54.615 --> 36:56.981
- It's a date.
- So, we've got the bird whisperer

36:57.118 --> 36:58.813
- confirmed for Tuesday?
- Yes.

36:58.953 --> 37:01.217
Great. And...
Al Green on the plaza Wednesday.

37:01.356 --> 37:02.550
- Two songs.
- OK.

37:02.690 --> 37:05.124
And Colleen, do you want to do
the interview between the songs?

37:08.496 --> 37:10.259
No, let me.

37:14.602 --> 37:15.864
Yeah, I'll do it.

37:16.904 --> 37:22.433
OK. Mike, so we have this great story
on children's water safety.

37:23.845 --> 37:26.006
- That's the...
- Not my thing.

37:27.515 --> 37:31.110
OK, how about a rundown of the new
shows on the fall television season?

37:31.252 --> 37:34.016
- Oh, yeah. That's a no.
- OK.

37:34.155 --> 37:37.647
The boom in organic farming.
Very hot topic right now.

37:37.792 --> 37:40.989
That's newsy, right?

37:41.129 --> 37:43.222
What do you want me to do?
Fire another anchor?

37:43.364 --> 37:46.094
Then we're gonna be stuck with
that guy who counts with his hooves.

37:46.234 --> 37:48.998
Colleen can't do every story
that's not hard news.

37:49.137 --> 37:51.833
It's Mike Pomeroy. He's a legend.
What am I supposed to tell him?

37:51.973 --> 37:54.908
- There she is.
- What? Oh, hi.

37:55.043 --> 37:57.705
Interesting, Jerry hired you.

37:58.980 --> 38:02.746
No polish. No pedigree.
Those bangs.

38:02.884 --> 38:05.352
What was he thinking?

38:09.657 --> 38:11.522
Just wondering.

38:13.161 --> 38:15.629
- He's a peach.
- Yeah.

38:16.431 --> 38:18.194
Coming soon to Daybreak,

38:18.332 --> 38:21.927
one of the most legendary newsmen
of all time.

38:22.070 --> 38:25.972
Soon, he'll be bringing his
experience to morning television.

38:26.107 --> 38:29.167
Let Mike Pomeroy show you the world

38:29.310 --> 38:31.244
over your first cup of coffee!

38:31.379 --> 38:34.041
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- What? What, what, what is it now?

38:34.182 --> 38:37.208
It's embarrassing. I mean,
what's in the briefcase?

38:37.351 --> 38:39.546
- What do you mean? What?
- Special anchorman papers?

38:39.687 --> 38:41.245
- It doesn't matter.
- My lunch? Where am I going?

38:41.389 --> 38:42.981
- We've been over this eight times!
- I'm running to nowhere.

38:43.124 --> 38:45.991
- I look like a jackass!
- No... Yes, you do.

38:47.428 --> 38:50.488
You know, whoever gave you
promo approval was smoking crack!

38:50.631 --> 38:52.030
- I want to meet that person.
- I was mopping the floor

38:52.166 --> 38:53.690
- with Peter Jennings at the time.
- I want to have words with...

38:53.835 --> 38:56.395
I could have had hookers and
eight balls written into my contract.

38:56.537 --> 38:59.131
- How nice for you.
...over your first cup of coffee.

38:59.273 --> 39:02.731
Why do we have to mention that first
cup of coffee? Why not just say,

39:02.877 --> 39:06.278
"Watch Mike Pomeroy
before your morning dump?"

39:07.615 --> 39:09.276
One of the most legendary newsmen...

39:09.417 --> 39:12.386
So for the fashion segments, I think
it's important that we interpret

39:12.520 --> 39:16.889
runway trends for our viewers because
they're not all six foot and size zero.

39:17.024 --> 39:20.516
- Man, he's cute.
- I went to Yale with him.

39:20.661 --> 39:21.650
- Shut up.
- You did not.

39:21.796 --> 39:23.263
Everyone was madly in love with him.

39:23.397 --> 39:25.797
Actually, just me and
every single person I knew.

39:25.933 --> 39:28.026
- Can we just?
- His dad was editor of Newsweek.

39:28.169 --> 39:30.660
His mom's family is rich as hell.
They own like Tupperware or something.

39:30.805 --> 39:33.638
He rowed crew for Yale when they won
the national championship.

39:37.111 --> 39:38.100
Hi.

39:41.916 --> 39:45.647
- You know him?
- No. Yeah, well, yes, I mean, I...

39:45.786 --> 39:47.845
- Yes.
- Don't you think he's smokin'?

39:47.989 --> 39:49.923
- Smokin'.
- Yeah.

39:50.057 --> 39:53.026
I don't know, I don't know.
Let me see. I don't know.

39:53.161 --> 39:55.061
- Not a hard question.
- He's walking away.

39:55.196 --> 39:58.632
So jeans and belts.

39:58.766 --> 40:01.394
You have a rash or something
spreading on your neck.

40:17.985 --> 40:21.216
Well, you know,
I asked him to do a piece on Trump.

40:21.355 --> 40:24.984
And he actually picked up my Diet Coke
and hurled it across the room.

40:25.126 --> 40:27.754
- Wow, he picked it up.
- Just missed me. He did.

40:27.895 --> 40:30.420
I asked him to cover
a bumper crop of cranberries

40:30.565 --> 40:33.261
and he slapped me in the face.

40:33.401 --> 40:35.130
- He did?
- It's true.

40:35.269 --> 40:37.533
- Really?
- Of course, he was drunk off his ass.

40:37.672 --> 40:38.696
Adam!

40:38.839 --> 40:40.670
- Hi.
- Hi. How are ya?

40:40.808 --> 40:43.675
- I'm good.
- Hi.

40:43.811 --> 40:46.405
- You never called me!
- I'm sorry.

40:46.547 --> 40:49.380
We... I was...
I've been workin' a lot.

40:49.517 --> 40:52.850
Well, maybe I'll see you at
Barton's regatta party on Saturday.

40:52.987 --> 40:54.545
- Great, great.
- OK, great.

40:54.689 --> 40:55.849
Yeah, cool.

40:57.325 --> 41:00.351
- Sorry, I was just...
- That's OK.

41:00.494 --> 41:02.462
Absolutely fine. That's fine, fine.

41:02.597 --> 41:04.155
- Bye.
- See you later.

41:07.335 --> 41:12.637
- Yeah.
- So, anyway,

41:12.773 --> 41:15.537
the reason that I came by tonight,

41:15.676 --> 41:19.305
was because I don't really know
that many people who know Mike,

41:19.447 --> 41:22.746
and I thought, that, you know,
I could get your professional feedback.

41:22.883 --> 41:25.784
- My feedback?
- Yeah, you know.

41:25.920 --> 41:29.981
I mean, 'cause I'm actually
new in town and I don't...

41:30.124 --> 41:31.887
- Come on.
- No, please.

41:32.026 --> 41:34.620
...have that many work contacts, so...

41:34.762 --> 41:38.721
Great. So... we'll be contacts?

41:38.866 --> 41:40.595
That would be great.

41:40.735 --> 41:43.067
Well, you can never
have enough of those.

41:44.205 --> 41:45.297
No, you can't.

41:45.439 --> 41:48.169
So, definitely be seeing you around.

41:48.309 --> 41:49.901
- OK.
- OK.

42:00.254 --> 42:01.516
Shit.

42:03.491 --> 42:05.823
OK. Good rehearsal. Good stuff.

42:05.960 --> 42:09.953
So let's just alternate the
voiceover intros of the headlines.

42:10.097 --> 42:12.190
- OK.
- And then ad-lib.

42:12.333 --> 42:15.427
So, let's say, for example, we're doing
a story about, I don't know,

42:15.569 --> 42:18.094
- a midterm election.
- But we won't.

42:18.239 --> 42:19.797
Because the morning shows
don't do news.

42:19.940 --> 42:22.932
Pompous. That's really interesting.
That's a different color for you.

42:23.077 --> 42:26.569
- That's...
- OK, and you two should just sort of,

42:26.714 --> 42:28.978
you know, banter back and forth
a little bit.

42:29.116 --> 42:32.552
Banter, from the Latin word,
meaning "to gibber like a moron?"

42:32.687 --> 42:34.587
Just, you know,
talk about the headlines.

42:34.722 --> 42:37.020
That's... that's what I mean.

42:37.158 --> 42:40.127
I'm not gonna sit here and rehearse
like I'm in summer stock.

42:40.261 --> 42:42.491
I've been on the air for 40 years,
for Christ's sake.

42:42.630 --> 42:44.325
I think I know how to ad-lib.

42:46.300 --> 42:48.393
The spill began
when the tanker was damaged

42:48.536 --> 42:50.970
in heavy seas outside Galveston.

42:51.572 --> 42:52.800
Knock, knock.

42:52.940 --> 42:54.464
Can I come in?

42:56.077 --> 42:58.545
I just wanted to say,

42:58.679 --> 43:01.671
you know, good luck.

43:03.217 --> 43:05.378
Colleen's Pap smear.

43:06.520 --> 43:08.818
A television classic.

43:10.391 --> 43:11.756
Are you drunk?

43:11.892 --> 43:14.326
Insufficiently.

43:14.462 --> 43:17.522
Current weather conditions
are complicating efforts

43:17.665 --> 43:20.031
...to contain the...
- That's my chair.

43:20.167 --> 43:21.862
What?

43:22.002 --> 43:25.665
That's where I belong. There.

43:25.806 --> 43:27.273
...authorities have asked
the federal government...

43:27.408 --> 43:30.172
Took it away from me,
those motherfu...

43:30.311 --> 43:31.903
I think maybe you should just go home...

43:32.046 --> 43:34.276
- See this?
- Yes. What is that?

43:34.415 --> 43:37.384
Forty-year-old Bruichladdich.

43:37.518 --> 43:41.079
I only drink this
when I'm practically suicidal.

43:41.989 --> 43:43.479
OK.

43:44.725 --> 43:46.522
You're, you're very funny.

43:48.529 --> 43:51.862
Well, I'm gonna see you tomorrow...
right?

43:51.999 --> 43:54.229
...is almost impossible to calculate.

44:22.263 --> 44:23.252
Hi.

44:23.397 --> 44:24.796
- Hi.
- Hi.

44:24.932 --> 44:27.400
Hi. I...

44:27.535 --> 44:31.096
Sorry. I thought that I might
swing by to...

44:33.240 --> 44:34.764
...see if...

44:37.378 --> 44:39.312
What are you working on?

44:40.481 --> 44:41.675
We're working on a piece

44:41.816 --> 44:43.716
on the communist rebels
in the Philippines.

44:43.851 --> 44:46.911
Good. That sounds great. So I went to
the bar the other night to see you.

44:47.054 --> 44:50.251
Yeah, I could tell. By the way
you ran in the other direction.

44:50.391 --> 44:52.450
Your arms, pinwheeling.

44:57.064 --> 44:59.089
Yeah. OK, fair, true.

45:01.569 --> 45:03.298
I think that you're sort of...

45:04.505 --> 45:06.439
...comically great.

45:06.574 --> 45:10.101
And I thought it seemed
so promising so I bungled it,

45:10.244 --> 45:12.075
because that's what I do.
I bungle things.

45:12.213 --> 45:15.580
I bungle and I ramble, and that's
kind of like what I'm doing right now,

45:15.716 --> 45:18.879
talking about it.
You threw me off guard.

45:19.019 --> 45:21.214
You, with your...

45:21.355 --> 45:23.482
And the... and the, this...

45:23.624 --> 45:24.716
And the...

45:26.227 --> 45:28.457
My working on a loom?

45:28.596 --> 45:30.621
- My, my...
- No.

45:30.764 --> 45:34.723
...double-handed craps. My...
- I...

45:34.869 --> 45:37.963
- My Jazzercise.
- Rowing. Rowing.

45:38.105 --> 45:39.697
- Rowing?
- Championship?

45:39.840 --> 45:42.638
I never would have got that.

45:42.776 --> 45:44.744
But you know what I mean.

45:44.879 --> 45:50.010
That I didn't think that you...
liked me.

45:50.150 --> 45:53.483
But I do. Oddly.

45:53.621 --> 45:56.215
You're... different.

45:56.357 --> 45:58.450
And a deeply terrible mime.

45:59.393 --> 46:02.191
Well, I asked you out.
Then when I saw you at the bar,

46:02.329 --> 46:05.230
I practically tackled you to the ground.
What part of that was confusing?

46:05.366 --> 46:07.664
Here, here, here, sit down.

46:07.801 --> 46:11.601
Look, my radar for that kind of thing
is so bad.

46:11.739 --> 46:15.334
I mean, I don't know if a man's
interested in me until he's naked.

46:15.476 --> 46:17.205
I mean, the pants come off
and then I'm like,

46:17.344 --> 46:19.778
"I guess you don't really want
to see my CD collection

46:19.914 --> 46:24.044
- or talk about Kerouac."
- You're nuts.

46:26.053 --> 46:28.044
OK, look.

46:28.188 --> 46:30.019
Let's start over.

46:30.157 --> 46:33.183
Let's go out to dinner
like... regular people.

46:33.327 --> 46:36.057
Just take it slowly,
just see where it leads.

46:36.196 --> 46:41.498
- How does that sound?
- That sounds perfect.

46:46.206 --> 46:48.299
Oh, God, I should go home.

46:49.443 --> 46:51.377
It's eight! It's eight already.

46:51.512 --> 46:55.004
- I know.
- It's Mike's first day tomorrow.

46:55.149 --> 46:56.912
- You should definitely go.
- What's the big whoop?

46:57.051 --> 46:59.713
I mean, you know, he's done this
like a million times before.

46:59.853 --> 47:02.151
- Yeah.
- And he knows exactly what he's doing.

47:02.289 --> 47:03.654
- Yeah.
- So...

47:03.791 --> 47:04.849
It's fine.

47:10.130 --> 47:12.792
He didn't open a bottle of
40-year-old Bruichladdich, did he?

47:14.068 --> 47:15.433
How do you know that?

47:17.605 --> 47:19.038
What?

47:19.773 --> 47:21.172
When I was working with him,

47:21.308 --> 47:24.505
if there was something that
he didn't want to do, the Oscars,

47:24.645 --> 47:27.443
the Olympics, something that people
might actually get a tiny twinge

47:27.581 --> 47:31.677
of pleasure from, the night before,
he would go on a bender.

47:32.219 --> 47:35.279
Call in sick for work the next day.

47:36.123 --> 47:39.650
No. No, no. This is ridiculous.
I'm not...

47:39.793 --> 47:41.818
I'm not going out there
and chasing him around.

47:41.962 --> 47:45.420
If he wants to screw this up,
that is his problem.

47:49.303 --> 47:52.670
- Start at Elaine's.
- Oh, God, thank you. Thank you.

47:54.274 --> 47:56.003
I'm sorry.

47:56.143 --> 47:58.008
We'll do it again sometime.

48:06.253 --> 48:07.777
Thanks.

48:10.357 --> 48:11.449
- Pomeroy?
- Yeah.

48:11.592 --> 48:13.457
He was here.
He left about an hour ago.

48:43.757 --> 48:45.816
Oh, no. The little woman.

48:46.727 --> 48:49.059
- Incoming.
- Jesus Christ, Pomeroy,

48:49.196 --> 48:51.027
they're getting younger and younger.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.068
Mike... I need to talk to you.

48:56.203 --> 48:59.229
Why? Is the baby mine?

49:00.574 --> 49:04.203
I will have you know that this show
is very important to a lot of people,

49:04.344 --> 49:08.644
including but not limited to me.
My ass is on the line here.

49:08.782 --> 49:11.808
Actually, your ass is irrelevant.

49:11.952 --> 49:14.580
You're just a footnote. It's my ass,

49:14.722 --> 49:18.419
my reputation, my integrity, mine!

49:18.559 --> 49:21.187
"Mine!" You're such an egotistical,
selfish person!

49:21.328 --> 49:23.319
I'm on-air talent!

49:27.201 --> 49:28.896
Get in.

49:30.337 --> 49:31.565
Hey!

49:35.843 --> 49:38.243
OK, I'm home. You can leave.

49:38.378 --> 49:40.642
Oh, no. No.

49:45.119 --> 49:46.416
Wow.

49:53.761 --> 49:55.752
Oh, my God.

50:00.033 --> 50:02.001
- Is that a real...
- Good night

50:02.136 --> 50:04.036
Of course.

50:07.141 --> 50:11.271
Here we are
Just about the same

50:13.380 --> 50:15.507
You're alone tonight?

50:17.851 --> 50:19.284
Makes sense.

50:20.788 --> 50:22.688
Let me guess.

50:24.525 --> 50:26.356
You meet a guy.

50:26.493 --> 50:29.053
You have about three dates.

50:29.196 --> 50:32.063
Spend the whole time talking
about your job.

50:33.033 --> 50:35.558
He loses your phone number.

50:39.173 --> 50:42.506
Aside from your obvious father issues,

50:42.643 --> 50:44.338
what'd he do?

50:44.478 --> 50:46.503
Leave you? Die?

50:46.647 --> 50:50.606
You've got this... repellent moxie.

50:50.751 --> 50:53.015
Look at all the stories
you could be doing here.

50:53.153 --> 50:57.817
About art and hunting and fishing.

50:57.958 --> 51:00.688
I mean, you have grandchildren.

51:00.828 --> 51:03.160
I didn't even know you had kids.

51:04.264 --> 51:06.232
Look, we could be
doing parenting segments.

51:06.366 --> 51:08.766
You should invite them down
to the show.

51:10.671 --> 51:13.003
The ungrateful little bastards.

51:13.140 --> 51:14.937
I don't think so.

51:15.075 --> 51:17.305
Well, the little tour's over.

51:18.412 --> 51:20.812
Time to go back to your sad little life.

51:20.948 --> 51:24.213
I'm not going anywhere
until we are on the air.

51:24.351 --> 51:26.717
Well, please don't snore.
I'm a light sleeper.

51:26.854 --> 51:28.822
I'm not going to be sleeping.

51:28.956 --> 51:30.184
Just about the same

51:30.324 --> 51:34.886
Foggy little fella
Drowsy little dame

51:35.028 --> 51:39.658
Two sleepy people
by dawn's early light

51:39.800 --> 51:41.768
And too much in love
to say good night

51:41.902 --> 51:42.960
Good night.

51:43.103 --> 51:45.697
- Good night.
- Good night.

52:43.297 --> 52:45.094
Let's go, girl.

52:53.774 --> 52:56.572
- What are you doing?
- Have you ever seen a real egg?

52:56.710 --> 52:59.804
These are from
pastured hens in Maryland.

52:59.947 --> 53:04.350
- We have to go.
- I have them delivered once a week.

53:04.484 --> 53:06.645
We have to go.

53:06.787 --> 53:09.722
Now, the beauty of a frittata

53:09.856 --> 53:12.416
is that it can be made
with any ingredient.

53:12.559 --> 53:14.959
Anything that's in your refrigerator.

53:15.095 --> 53:17.791
- Good. Get dressed.
- What? You want me to starve?

53:17.931 --> 53:20.263
I've got to be in tip-top shape.

53:20.400 --> 53:23.767
I'm going to appear on national
television in front of...

53:23.904 --> 53:28.034
- What, six or eight people?
- Mike, come on.

53:29.242 --> 53:30.766
Coffee?

53:30.911 --> 53:34.870
What few people know
is that the frittata

53:35.015 --> 53:38.007
was meant to be eaten
at room temperature.

53:38.151 --> 53:40.210
- It was invented in Italy...
- Come on.

53:40.354 --> 53:43.619
...for the afternoon repast.
- Look, guess what?

53:43.757 --> 53:46.089
I don't really care
about your epicurean breakfast, OK?

53:46.226 --> 53:49.024
I just need you to walk faster,
because we are going to be late.

53:51.832 --> 53:54.733
Hey. Hello, there.

53:54.868 --> 53:57.564
- Where the hell have you been?
- It's a long story.

53:57.704 --> 53:59.467
She spent the night at my place.

54:05.679 --> 54:08.546
Come on, everyone.
I slept on the couch.

54:08.682 --> 54:13.312
Until I woke her up with my...
African rain stick.

54:17.324 --> 54:21.920
All right. OK. It's Mike's first show,
so it's a really big day for us.

54:22.062 --> 54:24.587
- Fire me today.
- Yeah, so let's go...

54:24.731 --> 54:26.096
through the lineup from the top.

54:26.333 --> 54:27.265
One more time.

54:27.401 --> 54:30.393
We start with eight, full track.
We'll be cutting to nine with announce.

54:30.537 --> 54:33.005
Nine will reveal the jib.
Jib, start a little wider.

54:33.140 --> 54:36.303
OK. What are they promo-ing
on the Today show today?

54:36.443 --> 54:38.434
- What aren't they promo-ing?
- What?

54:39.913 --> 54:41.710
Crap. No.
Vieira scored that interview

54:41.848 --> 54:45.215
with the drunk-driving
Playboy Playmate? What's on G.M. A?

54:45.352 --> 54:47.912
- Well, she's doin' Clooney. Yeah.
- Bitch.

54:48.055 --> 54:51.582
Try not to bore the nation into a coma
with your dull news crap, OK?

54:51.725 --> 54:53.693
Yes, certainly.

54:53.827 --> 54:56.625
Oh, and... suck it.

54:57.931 --> 55:01.025
Well, they look great together,
so that's promising.

55:01.168 --> 55:02.897
Oh, heavenly ghost
of Edward R. Murrow.

55:03.036 --> 55:06.130
OK, the Jewish guy is crossing himself,
so we're confident.

55:06.273 --> 55:08.002
Thirty seconds to air.
Everybody ready?

55:08.141 --> 55:09.267
They know about the cake?

55:09.409 --> 55:11.741
Everybody does? Stage manager's
got that covered? Good.

55:11.878 --> 55:14.244
- Cake is good to go. D-Day.
- I want the double matte through

55:14.381 --> 55:18.112
both names, both names.
Great. OK, stand by...

55:18.251 --> 55:20.776
Stand by, ticker.
Stand by, Deko, that's great.

55:20.921 --> 55:22.650
- You ready for this?
- I'm ready. Are you ready?

55:22.789 --> 55:25.883
Stand by, announce.
Ready to roll nine.

55:26.026 --> 55:28.426
Here we go and roll nine.
Take nine.

55:28.562 --> 55:31.053
- We're good so far.
- Stand by to go on four.

55:31.198 --> 55:33.257
- And... here we go.
...on Daybreak.

55:33.400 --> 55:34.697
- And go on four.
- Seven.

55:34.835 --> 55:36.166
- Reveals four.
- There they are.

55:36.303 --> 55:39.238
- Five.
- Four, three...

55:39.372 --> 55:43.138
...and Mike Pomeroy.
- Go dissolve to Mike and cue them.

55:43.276 --> 55:44.504
Good morning, everyone.

55:44.644 --> 55:48.876
Before we begin, today is
a historic moment here on Daybreak.

55:49.015 --> 55:52.781
Today's the day that Mike Pomeroy
joins our little show.

55:52.919 --> 55:56.355
We are so lucky to have a journalist
of your caliber here with us, Mike.

55:56.490 --> 55:59.084
We're just... what can we say except,
welcome, welcome.

55:59.226 --> 56:01.524
Yes.

56:01.661 --> 56:03.788
- He said yes.
- That's it?

56:03.930 --> 56:06.865
- Yes? He said yes.
- Yes. You got to be kidding me.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.297
- That's great.
- That's all it is.

56:08.435 --> 56:10.630
- Bring on the cake.
- We have a little surprise for you.

56:10.770 --> 56:14.706
- Push in the cake.
- Happy First Day to you

56:14.841 --> 56:17.776
- Happy First Day to you
- Ready three on Jane.

56:17.911 --> 56:21.142
- Happy First...
- Thank you.

56:21.281 --> 56:23.681
- Now on to today's top stories.
- Go, take it.

56:23.817 --> 56:27.776
In Texas today, severe weather
continues to plague the Gulf Coast.

56:27.921 --> 56:30.617
He's not buyin' it. Wow.

56:30.757 --> 56:33.521
OK, all right, very good.
So far, he's a cozy blanket.

56:33.660 --> 56:36.322
I need 22. Great.

56:36.463 --> 56:39.125
...sexual offender is a Caucasian male
in his late thirties,

56:39.266 --> 56:42.463
approximately six feet tall.
He apparently works alone,

56:42.602 --> 56:45.833
gaining access to homes through
unlocked windows and doors.

56:45.972 --> 56:47.667
- Stand by to change.
- Local police in Milwaukee

56:47.807 --> 56:51.334
are asking anyone who recognizes this
sketch to contact them immediately.

56:51.478 --> 56:53.946
- Change your graphic. And change it.
- In other news,

56:54.080 --> 56:57.607
former President Jimmy Carter
continued his campaign

56:57.751 --> 56:59.912
- for human rights in Beijing this week.
- Hey!

57:00.053 --> 57:01.350
- What?
- Guys, the...

57:01.488 --> 57:02.921
- The graphic.
- Are you?

57:03.056 --> 57:05.718
- Change the graphic!
- See, the thing on the...

57:05.859 --> 57:07.156
...on the graphic.
- Lose the graphic!

57:07.294 --> 57:08.283
- Guys!
- Lose it!

57:08.428 --> 57:11.864
Get the... the font on the graphic,
like the type on the...

57:11.998 --> 57:13.761
- Please.
- China has been accused

57:13.900 --> 57:17.199
- by detractors of backsliding...
- You just...

57:17.337 --> 57:20.568
Yep, yep. Yep, yep, yep.

57:20.707 --> 57:22.675
Stand by to change. Deko in.

57:22.809 --> 57:23.901
We're going to weather.

57:24.044 --> 57:26.376
For first look at weather,
here's Ernie Appleby.

57:26.513 --> 57:28.003
Thanks, Colleen.

57:28.148 --> 57:31.117
I'd like to take a moment to welcome
Mike Pomeroy to his first broadcast.

57:31.251 --> 57:35.278
As one hurricane said to another,
I have my eye on you.

57:39.626 --> 57:42.117
And lookin' across the country today,
you'll see we still have

57:42.262 --> 57:44.253
that high-pressure system
comin' out of the Midwest.

57:44.397 --> 57:46.922
We'll dissolve to tape.
Tape, stand by.

57:47.067 --> 57:49.592
I want a center shot. Just keep...
Just center on one. Center on one.

57:49.736 --> 57:52.534
That's perfect. Here we...
OK, great. Ready one. Ready two.

57:52.672 --> 57:54.105
And go two.

57:54.241 --> 57:55.936
Dissolve to Mike, and cue them.

57:56.076 --> 57:57.907
And ticker in.

57:58.044 --> 58:00.979
Tomorrow on Daybreak, we'll show you
eight things you didn't know

58:01.114 --> 58:03.742
you could do with potatoes.
Should be fun.

58:03.883 --> 58:08.081
Also, we'll talk to some relief workers
who say the international community

58:08.221 --> 58:10.985
- has abrogated its duty to protect...
- What the hell is abrogated?

58:11.124 --> 58:12.989
That wasn't on the teleprompter.

58:13.126 --> 58:15.856
- Ready to widen on two.
- And that's our show for this morning.

58:15.996 --> 58:18.590
Welcome to the Daybreak family, Mike.

58:18.732 --> 58:22.634
- And thank you...
- Thank you, everyone. Goodbye.

58:22.769 --> 58:24.464
Goodbye.

58:25.672 --> 58:27.139
Goodbye.

58:27.274 --> 58:28.605
Goodbye.

58:29.175 --> 58:31.040
- Goodbye.
- How many is that?

58:31.177 --> 58:33.475
- Goodbye.
- Three each.

58:33.613 --> 58:36.275
- Bye.
- And we're out!

58:36.416 --> 58:39.908
- Fade to black. Here we go.
- Bye-bye.

58:42.289 --> 58:43.278
You know what you are?

58:43.423 --> 58:46.051
Excuse me for saying this,
but you're an asshole, OK?

58:46.192 --> 58:50.219
- Becky! What's her last name?
- You said you would banter!

58:50.363 --> 58:53.526
No, no, no, no.
You said I would banter.

58:53.667 --> 58:55.999
I said I would anchor a news show.

58:56.136 --> 59:00.038
That's what my contract calls for.
And that's what I'm going to do.

59:00.173 --> 59:03.108
But, Mike, you can't just go out there
and give monosyllabic answers

59:03.243 --> 59:06.610
- and talk about natural disasters!
- Are you sure?

59:06.746 --> 59:10.375
'Cause I think that's what I just did.
Anyway, what are you doing here?

59:10.517 --> 59:11.814
You have to get back to your office

59:11.951 --> 59:14.351
and wait for your phone call
from Jimmy Carter.

59:14.487 --> 59:19.618
- What?
- Jimmy Carter, "sexual offender."

59:19.759 --> 59:22.227
Now, go away, I'm busy.

59:22.362 --> 59:25.388
- But Mike, can you just promise...
- Go away.

59:27.267 --> 59:30.293
Go away. I just go away!

59:37.510 --> 59:40.536
Hey. It wasn't that bad.

59:45.118 --> 59:47.382
I don't wanna talk about it.

59:47.520 --> 59:48.748
OK.

59:52.025 --> 59:53.549
There's a plan.

01:00:00.467 --> 01:00:01.900
Sorry, just...

01:00:02.602 --> 01:00:03.591
Hey.

01:00:05.939 --> 01:00:08.271
I may need to see who that is.

01:00:09.209 --> 01:00:11.734
- OK. What if something happens?
- Then someone else

01:00:11.878 --> 01:00:14.108
will cover the world's biggest pumpkin.

01:00:15.448 --> 01:00:16.676
- That's not fair.
- No.

01:00:16.816 --> 01:00:18.807
No. Because you work for
a magazine show.

01:00:18.952 --> 01:00:20.783
- Yes.
- And you do one 15-minute story

01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.478
- every two months.
- That's right.

01:00:22.622 --> 01:00:26.888
And we are doing 15 stories a day,
none more than three minutes each,

01:00:27.026 --> 01:00:29.392
I mean, maybe three and a half,
if it's the President

01:00:29.529 --> 01:00:31.997
or they're nude photos or something...

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:34.600
How reliable
is your alarm clock?

01:00:43.076 --> 01:00:46.637
...is making progress.
However, one good piece of news

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:49.874
- is that the winds have come in...
- What's goin' on?

01:00:50.016 --> 01:00:52.314
Fire out west.
They're looking for an arsonist

01:00:52.452 --> 01:00:55.421
and they think that he might have
set the fire, like, three weeks ago?

01:00:55.555 --> 01:00:56.920
He could be a serial offender.

01:00:57.056 --> 01:00:59.820
- It's the middle of the night.
- I'm sorry.

01:01:01.694 --> 01:01:05.824
I have had such a lovely time.

01:01:05.965 --> 01:01:08.627
I really have and I...

01:01:08.768 --> 01:01:12.295
- I'm so glad that we...
- Go.

01:01:13.506 --> 01:01:16.703
- What?
- You want to go. You should go.

01:01:19.112 --> 01:01:21.012
Are you sure about that?

01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:23.914
Get out of here.

01:01:31.257 --> 01:01:32.485
Thank you.

01:02:27.947 --> 01:02:30.438
Good Morning America
got the mother of the arsonist.

01:02:30.583 --> 01:02:34.542
What? Ass!

01:02:35.922 --> 01:02:40.916
Don't. All right, I need
an arsonist spouse or something.

01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:42.721
- Damn it.
- So you're gettin'scooped

01:02:42.862 --> 01:02:46.662
like every morning. How come?
I mean, do you have any kind of plan?

01:02:46.799 --> 01:02:49.393
Yes, the show will still...
need some fine-tuning...

01:02:49.536 --> 01:02:51.663
Fine-tuning? Really?

01:02:51.804 --> 01:02:53.465
Can you tune something
when nothing is working?

01:02:53.606 --> 01:02:56.074
Mike Pomeroy is the key
to making this show work.

01:02:56.209 --> 01:02:58.700
Well, at the moment, he's ruining
your show, and to be honest,

01:02:58.845 --> 01:03:00.870
you haven't got much time
for fine-tuning, right?

01:03:01.014 --> 01:03:03.346
- Yeah. I'm not worried.
- You're... Really?

01:03:03.483 --> 01:03:04.950
I'm not worried.

01:03:05.084 --> 01:03:07.382
How about profiles?
We're doing a piece on Daniel Boulud.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:10.546
Does it end with me in
the kitchen making profiterole?

01:03:10.690 --> 01:03:11.748
No.

01:03:12.792 --> 01:03:15.420
Cornish hens.
OK, forget that.

01:03:15.562 --> 01:03:18.497
How about an interview
with Tim McGraw and Faith Hill?

01:03:18.631 --> 01:03:22.590
Either one of them becomes president
or cures cancer, let me know.

01:03:22.735 --> 01:03:24.930
But I do have one good lead.

01:03:25.071 --> 01:03:27.005
Yeah? Yeah, really?

01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:32.009
- I hear you're dating Senor Dipshit.
- What?

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:34.272
- How did you make that happen?
- Who told you that?

01:03:34.414 --> 01:03:37.076
- Him and you, really?
- No, I'm...

01:03:37.216 --> 01:03:40.743
Because usually, you know, he dates
girls that are sort of, you know with...

01:03:40.887 --> 01:03:43.822
Taffy pullers with...
heavy meatballs?

01:03:43.957 --> 01:03:46.983
There's a developing story
coming out of Albany, though.

01:03:47.126 --> 01:03:49.321
The governor's
tax returns are being audited.

01:03:49.462 --> 01:03:52.625
Oh, for God's sakes,
you're killing me, no!

01:03:52.765 --> 01:03:55.359
- I want people to get to know you.
- No, you don't.

01:03:55.501 --> 01:03:59.267
You want me to pander so you can
sell erectile dysfunction medication.

01:03:59.405 --> 01:04:01.032
- Oh, no, I don't.
- Well, I won't!

01:04:01.174 --> 01:04:03.165
Oh, my God!
It's you, you're that guy!

01:04:03.309 --> 01:04:06.403
I just saw you this morning and
everyone was eating stuffed zucchini,

01:04:06.546 --> 01:04:09.208
and you were cranky about it. I was
like, "Oh, my God, there's that guy!"

01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:12.011
You used to do news, right?
Like a while ago? It's...

01:04:13.386 --> 01:04:15.752
Please, remove your hand
from my person. Thank you.

01:04:15.888 --> 01:04:20.257
This is great! Thank you!
I can't believe it! Dan Rather!

01:04:21.194 --> 01:04:24.027
- Dan Rather!
- See? People want to like you.

01:04:24.163 --> 01:04:26.495
You're...
you're in their home every day,

01:04:26.633 --> 01:04:28.828
and, you know,
it's an honor and, you know,

01:04:28.968 --> 01:04:32.927
why can't you just do stories
people might enjoy? Mike...

01:04:33.606 --> 01:04:35.540
We're in trouble. I'm in trouble.

01:04:35.675 --> 01:04:37.575
Help me, please.

01:04:39.946 --> 01:04:43.074
Dan Rather. For Christ's sake.

01:04:43.216 --> 01:04:45.514
Becky! Becky!

01:04:45.652 --> 01:04:47.381
Becky.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:50.956
I have a great idea for a segment.
Get ready for this.

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:54.491
Past lives.
If we could find out who celebrities

01:04:54.627 --> 01:04:57.790
had been in their past lives, I think
that would be terrific, don't you?

01:04:57.930 --> 01:05:03.493
I mean, what if Justin Timberlake
had been Abraham Lincoln?

01:05:04.270 --> 01:05:08.297
Many actors have changed their names
to be taken more seriously.

01:05:08.441 --> 01:05:10.170
Ricky Schroder became Rick.

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:12.743
The Rock became Dwayne Johnson.

01:05:12.879 --> 01:05:15.313
And Portia de Rossi's
name used to be Amanda,

01:05:15.448 --> 01:05:18.042
but she changed it so as to
sound more like the car,

01:05:18.184 --> 01:05:20.652
which she felt sounded
more impressorial.

01:05:20.787 --> 01:05:24.245
A new name has become the latest,
hottest accessory for celebrities,

01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:26.017
like a Birkin bag or a baby.

01:05:26.159 --> 01:05:28.684
Back to you, Mike or Michael.

01:05:28.828 --> 01:05:32.229
- Dissolve to Mike and ticker in.
- How did she get here?

01:05:32.365 --> 01:05:36.495
- Don't ask.
- What? Is she sleeping with someone?

01:05:38.604 --> 01:05:39.866
Pardon me?

01:05:40.907 --> 01:05:42.340
Thanks.

01:05:52.385 --> 01:05:55.548
- Have you seen these?
- Yes, but...

01:05:55.688 --> 01:05:58.054
You want to make the ratings worse?
That's why you came here?

01:05:58.191 --> 01:06:02.787
Well, no.
Mike is still getting up to speed.

01:06:02.929 --> 01:06:04.658
- I'm working on a couple elements.
- Gettin' Mike up to speed?

01:06:04.797 --> 01:06:06.958
- Yeah.
- You're circling the drain.

01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:10.592
You rarely book anybody decent
because of the ratings.

01:06:10.737 --> 01:06:12.967
- You're not gettin' any big interviews.
- We just need more time.

01:06:13.106 --> 01:06:16.371
- Just a little...
- God, you're, you're more naive

01:06:16.509 --> 01:06:20.275
- than I thought, aren't ya?
- Excuse me?

01:06:20.413 --> 01:06:23.871
The network wants to cancel the show.

01:06:24.851 --> 01:06:28.514
They want to run game shows
and syndicated talk instead.

01:06:30.923 --> 01:06:32.857
For a second,
I thought you might have a shot,

01:06:32.992 --> 01:06:34.721
especially when you got Pomeroy.
But the joke's on me,

01:06:34.861 --> 01:06:37.455
'cause it turns out you failed even more
completely than the network thought.

01:06:37.597 --> 01:06:39.690
In six weeks, they cancel the show.

01:06:39.832 --> 01:06:42.323
Not only will you have significantly
weakened our news division,

01:06:42.468 --> 01:06:44.459
you will have presided over the
demise of a show that's been on the air

01:06:44.604 --> 01:06:46.538
for 47 years! Nice work.

01:06:46.672 --> 01:06:50.039
Why don't you go over to PBS and see
if you can kill Sesame Street.

01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:56.039
Go. You've wasted enough of my time.

01:06:57.917 --> 01:07:01.250
We have six weeks.
Can you just not tell anyone yet?

01:07:01.387 --> 01:07:03.514
Because morale isn't exactly at a peak.

01:07:03.656 --> 01:07:06.420
Fine. Tell 'em when you want to.
It doesn't really matter, does it?

01:07:08.294 --> 01:07:10.592
Piper, get Phil Griffin on the phone.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:12.288
Tell him if I don't hear
from him by 5:00,

01:07:12.431 --> 01:07:15.832
those Super Bowl tickets
go to Phyllis McGrady!

01:07:15.968 --> 01:07:18.095
...joins us
now with details. Roger.

01:07:18.237 --> 01:07:21.331
It certainly is a happy day
here on Lincoln Road

01:07:21.474 --> 01:07:23.465
between Bedford Avenue
and Rogers Avenue.

01:07:23.609 --> 01:07:25.873
This is, yes, officials...

01:07:32.852 --> 01:07:34.149
- We're live at five, people.
- OK.

01:07:34.287 --> 01:07:37.688
Feathery, fleecy, flocculent?

01:07:37.824 --> 01:07:41.851
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- What? What's going on now?

01:07:41.994 --> 01:07:44.861
Mike is offended by a word
in the next story.

01:07:44.997 --> 01:07:47.898
He's offended.
It's about Easter chicks.

01:07:48.034 --> 01:07:49.695
I'm not saying the word "fluffy."

01:07:49.836 --> 01:07:52.236
It's bad enough I have to do
these ridiculous stories.

01:07:52.371 --> 01:07:54.271
You know what, buddy?
Guess what? Last week,

01:07:54.407 --> 01:07:57.205
I had to use the words "rectal"
and "moisture" in the same sentence.

01:07:57.343 --> 01:08:01.074
- Well, first dates can be awkward.
- Mike!

01:08:01.214 --> 01:08:02.238
- Becky...
- That's it!

01:08:02.381 --> 01:08:05.407
- Becky, Becky, what are you doin'?
- I've had enough!

01:08:06.485 --> 01:08:09.181
- Mike? I need to talk to you.
- Becky, we're back in 60.

01:08:09.322 --> 01:08:11.847
I'm sorry, this'll just take a second.

01:08:11.991 --> 01:08:15.051
I've looked up to you all my life.

01:08:15.194 --> 01:08:19.095
You know that? I actually idolized you.
My dad and I used to watch you on TV.

01:08:19.232 --> 01:08:22.462
So just, you know, imagine
my surprise when it turns out

01:08:22.602 --> 01:08:25.765
that you're actually the worst person
in the entire world.

01:08:25.904 --> 01:08:29.738
- Not the third worst! The worst!
- What's goin' on?

01:08:29.876 --> 01:08:33.403
Pomeroy.
He broke the latest Daybreak EP.

01:08:33.546 --> 01:08:35.411
...how lucky we all are
to have these jobs,

01:08:35.548 --> 01:08:37.379
- how quickly that can be taken away.
- We're back in...

01:08:37.515 --> 01:08:40.417
And there's this guy, this really
kind of great, smokin' guy

01:08:40.553 --> 01:08:43.716
who can actually stand me
long enough to have sex with me.

01:08:45.825 --> 01:08:48.817
And you know what? It's all just
a big mess. Because of you!

01:08:48.961 --> 01:08:51.895
You know, nobody can do
their jobs well around here

01:08:52.031 --> 01:08:55.261
because you can't be bothered
to do yours at all!

01:08:55.401 --> 01:08:59.861
And we're back.

01:09:00.006 --> 01:09:03.100
Welcome back to Daybreak. And now,
with a check of the weather,

01:09:03.242 --> 01:09:05.301
- here's Ernie.
- Take Ernie on the plaza.

01:09:05.444 --> 01:09:09.243
Thanks, Colleen. Surprisingly toasty day
out here, isn't it, folks?

01:09:09.381 --> 01:09:12.215
Yeah!

01:09:12.350 --> 01:09:15.684
Good day to break out the bikini.
I know I'm wearing mine right now.

01:09:17.055 --> 01:09:20.651
All right. Well, what do we have here?

01:09:20.792 --> 01:09:22.727
Goodness, honey.
I did not put her up to this.

01:09:22.862 --> 01:09:24.761
- Coke? Diet Coke?
- No, I don't want a Diet Coke.

01:09:24.897 --> 01:09:26.125
Step aside!

01:09:29.402 --> 01:09:33.667
- Jerry, I would like to talk to you.
- You're gonna bust a cap in my ass?

01:09:33.805 --> 01:09:37.742
What if I get the ratings up?
We've got six weeks.

01:09:37.877 --> 01:09:39.742
What if I move that needle just enough?

01:09:39.879 --> 01:09:42.176
- You won't.
- We'II, you're... you don't know that.

01:09:42.314 --> 01:09:43.612
- Becky.
- There's got to be some number

01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:46.741
I can hit that will give us a shot, that
would give us an extra six months,

01:09:46.886 --> 01:09:49.081
- something.
- Sure, if you got over one point five

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:52.587
- or something absurd like that...
- Done! So I've got your word?

01:09:52.725 --> 01:09:54.625
I get those ratings up more
than three quarters of a point,

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:57.092
- you give me more time?
- It won't happen.

01:09:57.229 --> 01:10:00.096
We'll see about that.

01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:02.967
And your girlfriend Lisa?

01:10:03.102 --> 01:10:05.570
Can you get her a dictionary
and stick her on somebody else's show?

01:10:05.705 --> 01:10:07.639
'Cause she's killing me.

01:10:11.444 --> 01:10:15.039
Wow, well, look who the wind blew in!
What happened to you?

01:10:15.181 --> 01:10:17.615
Well, we're gonna change a few things.

01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:19.718
- OK.
- Is Ernie in place?

01:10:19.852 --> 01:10:23.049
Yes, he is. He'll be interviewing people
as they come off the coaster.

01:10:23.189 --> 01:10:27.182
No, he won't. Not anymore, he's not.
We're gonna put him on that coaster.

01:10:27.326 --> 01:10:30.989
We're gonna strap a handheld to the car
in front of him and then go live. Boom.

01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:34.065
It's called "picking up the game,"
people. OK? So from now on,

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.727
every single story that we do,
it's gonna have to be sensational!

01:10:37.870 --> 01:10:40.134
We're gonna be more aggressive.
We're gonna work harder.

01:10:40.272 --> 01:10:41.432
And we're gonna do it right now.

01:10:43.242 --> 01:10:46.109
- Are, are you gonna?
- I'm not gonna sing!

01:10:46.245 --> 01:10:47.678
Why do people ask me that?

01:10:47.813 --> 01:10:50.907
So the big question is,
are we gonna be able to hear his mic?

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.985
Yes, we will.
If he has a heart attack,

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:56.918
we'll be able to capture
every heartrending scream.

01:10:57.056 --> 01:10:59.991
- Really? Great.
- Cue her.

01:11:00.126 --> 01:11:02.356
Thrill-seekers have something to look
forward to this summer

01:11:02.495 --> 01:11:05.589
as Six Flags unveils
a brand-new roller coaster.

01:11:05.731 --> 01:11:08.825
The "Manhandler" is
the fastest coaster in the U.S.

01:11:08.968 --> 01:11:13.029
- With speeds up to 130 miles an hour...
- Stand Ernie by. Here we go.

01:11:13.172 --> 01:11:16.835
...ninety-five degrees. Our own
Ernie Appleby is getting a sneak peek

01:11:16.976 --> 01:11:19.410
at this amazing new ride,
isn't that right, Ernie?

01:11:19.545 --> 01:11:22.343
- Standing by. Open his mic.
- Ernie, can you hear us?

01:11:22.481 --> 01:11:26.383
Yes. Yes, I can. And so far,
it's a beautiful ride.

01:11:26.519 --> 01:11:29.852
Quite an amazing view from up here.

01:11:29.989 --> 01:11:32.651
Mostly blue skies.
Cumulus clouds on the horizon,

01:11:32.792 --> 01:11:34.259
always a good sign this time of year.

01:11:35.394 --> 01:11:37.794
Might be heading into our first dip.

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:42.458
Oh, my. Oh, my.

01:11:42.601 --> 01:11:46.128
Oh, fu...

01:11:54.513 --> 01:11:56.071
No!

01:11:57.616 --> 01:12:00.642
Oh, yeah. No, this is a great idea.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.388
- Please, make it stop!
- Take two.

01:12:13.232 --> 01:12:16.929
What are you gonna do to him next?
Strap electrodes to his balls?

01:12:17.069 --> 01:12:20.800
I actually felt sorry for that
animatronic puppet asshole.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:23.932
Hey, look, we got 80,000 hits
on YouTube already.

01:12:24.076 --> 01:12:26.738
And Ernie is absolutely thrilled.
And by the way,

01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:28.369
we had another bump
in the minute-to-minutes.

01:12:28.514 --> 01:12:32.041
- Becky, good stuff.
- Thank you! Lighten up, Mike.

01:12:32.184 --> 01:12:34.846
You know what I've noticed?
People only say, "Lighten up"

01:12:34.987 --> 01:12:37.285
when they're gonna stick
their fist up your ass.

01:12:37.423 --> 01:12:39.084
Well, you know what?
I hate to break it to you,

01:12:39.225 --> 01:12:41.250
- but the fact is...
- Oh, my God, amazing segment.

01:12:41.393 --> 01:12:46.126
Thank you. The world has been debating
news versus entertainment for years

01:12:46.265 --> 01:12:48.324
and guess what?
Mike, your side lost.

01:12:48.467 --> 01:12:51.766
- You know what?
- What?

01:12:51.904 --> 01:12:55.271
You're wrong. People are smart.

01:12:55.407 --> 01:12:59.366
They want information. Not junk, which
is all you're willing to give them.

01:12:59.512 --> 01:13:02.538
- Junk. Sugar, sugar, sugar.
- Excuse me.

01:13:02.681 --> 01:13:04.376
- OK.
- And more sugar.

01:13:04.517 --> 01:13:07.077
Yeah, well, what would you
have them do, Mike?

01:13:07.219 --> 01:13:13.215
Eat bran all day?
Fiber, fiber, fiber?

01:13:13.359 --> 01:13:15.987
We have to get the ratings up, Mike,

01:13:16.128 --> 01:13:20.861
or we can have a lot of high-minded
ideas and not be on the air.

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:24.128
This show may go down, but it's not
because I'm not trying my hardest.

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:29.173
You hear me? I don't care what you do,
but I'm not giving up.

01:13:32.411 --> 01:13:33.345
I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk
to you right now about Ernie.

01:13:33.345 --> 01:13:35.575
I wanna talk to you. I wanna talk
to you right now about Ernie.

01:13:35.714 --> 01:13:37.147
- Oh, my God, you, too?
- Yes.

01:13:37.283 --> 01:13:39.080
Why is everyone worried about Ernie?
You know, he's a grown man.

01:13:39.218 --> 01:13:40.776
- Worried about Ernie? You kidding me?
- He signed release forms.

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.912
He's a hack.
Look, I see what you're doing.

01:13:44.056 --> 01:13:46.547
I think it's great. It's exactly
what I've been waiting for,

01:13:46.692 --> 01:13:49.024
so just, you know, sign me up, coach.
Put me in.

01:13:49.161 --> 01:13:51.061
- Whatever you want to call it.
- Really?

01:13:51.197 --> 01:13:52.391
Yeah.

01:13:53.465 --> 01:13:55.433
Do you have any preexisting conditions?

01:13:55.568 --> 01:13:58.867
Are you kidding? Look at me.
I'm a rock.

01:14:08.614 --> 01:14:09.876
Would you like to hold him?

01:14:10.015 --> 01:14:12.813
I would love to hold it,
dear little thing.

01:14:12.952 --> 01:14:14.817
Watch it.
Careful he doesn't go in there.

01:14:14.954 --> 01:14:15.943
Can you get it out though?

01:14:17.323 --> 01:14:19.587
Mike wanted to be here for this.
Mike Pomeroy.

01:14:19.725 --> 01:14:23.684
You know how he is.
He loves animals.

01:14:23.829 --> 01:14:25.387
Have you just... You...
And then...

01:14:43.816 --> 01:14:46.478
Those are frog lips.
Does a frog open its lips ever?

01:14:46.619 --> 01:14:48.610
Ready four, take four.
Ready one. Take one.

01:14:48.754 --> 01:14:50.449
Ready one. Take it.

01:14:50.589 --> 01:14:52.250
- I would never do that.
- Kiss it.

01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:54.985
How about a big kiss, sucker?

01:15:00.332 --> 01:15:01.924
That's a little, that's wrong.

01:15:04.236 --> 01:15:06.067
That was so good. Do it again.

01:15:12.444 --> 01:15:15.242
Fitty, Fitty! Mr. Cent?
Hi! Fan.

01:15:15.381 --> 01:15:17.906
Big fan!
Take you to the candy shop

01:15:18.050 --> 01:15:19.813
- Whoa, let you lick
- I heard the song.

01:15:19.952 --> 01:15:22.750
I'm a producer for Daybreak and we
would so love to have you on our show.

01:15:22.888 --> 01:15:24.822
We'd give you twice as much time
as the Today show.

01:15:24.957 --> 01:15:28.723
And you could play four songs from
your new record. Just think about it.

01:15:29.995 --> 01:15:32.225
I'll take you to the candy shop

01:15:32.364 --> 01:15:34.127
I'll let you lick the lollypop

01:15:34.266 --> 01:15:36.700
- Oh!
- Go 'head girl, Don't you stop

01:15:36.835 --> 01:15:37.802
Yeah!

01:15:37.936 --> 01:15:39.801
Keep going 'til you hit the spot, whoa!

01:15:39.938 --> 01:15:42.168
I'll take you to the candy shop

01:15:42.308 --> 01:15:44.037
Boy one taste of what I got

01:15:44.643 --> 01:15:46.133
I'll have you spending all you got...

01:15:46.278 --> 01:15:47.540
Ready one, take one! Ready two!

01:15:59.992 --> 01:16:00.981
Well!

01:16:01.126 --> 01:16:03.754
On the rabbi story, do you want
the transvestite prostitute

01:16:03.896 --> 01:16:06.194
- to be dressed as a man or a woman?
- A man.

01:16:06.332 --> 01:16:07.663
- Man.
- No, a woman.

01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:11.566
No, have him/her start
the segment as a woman and then,

01:16:11.704 --> 01:16:13.899
boom, after the break he/she
comes back as a man!

01:16:14.039 --> 01:16:16.507
- Yes. That's it.
- Yes. Yes.

01:16:23.882 --> 01:16:25.645
Back to you, Colleen.

01:16:28.053 --> 01:16:31.045
- All right! They've cut!
- Both. Emphatically.

01:16:31.190 --> 01:16:32.919
Here are the ratings.

01:16:33.726 --> 01:16:35.887
I know, I know.

01:16:36.962 --> 01:16:38.862
Yes, yes.

01:16:38.997 --> 01:16:41.329
And when we come back,
we'll tell you about

01:16:41.467 --> 01:16:44.459
new ways to cope with menopause.

01:16:49.742 --> 01:16:51.471
New doorknobs.

01:16:53.445 --> 01:16:54.742
OK.

01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.814
- And am I doing it right?
- Yes.

01:16:56.949 --> 01:16:58.246
How do you know?
You're not looking.

01:16:58.384 --> 01:17:03.014
Or we could do a whole series
on senior weight loss. A five-parter.

01:17:04.089 --> 01:17:07.024
We could get that health expert,
you know, the one with the...

01:17:10.796 --> 01:17:13.321
It's good, it's good, it's good.
I'll do it.

01:17:17.803 --> 01:17:18.895
Wait! Wait, look.

01:17:19.872 --> 01:17:23.399
The week-to-weeks are better and
total viewers are up by five percent!

01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:26.067
And those are not good enough!

01:17:26.211 --> 01:17:28.873
Turns out the burger patties were
contaminated with E. Coli,

01:17:29.014 --> 01:17:31.482
which can cause cramping and diarrhea.

01:17:31.617 --> 01:17:34.245
- Lose the ticker, music in...
- We'll be right back on Daybreak.

01:17:34.386 --> 01:17:36.820
Dissolve the logo. And mark.

01:17:37.890 --> 01:17:39.482
And we're out.

01:17:39.625 --> 01:17:42.788
Great, a story about uncontrollable
shitting and look who gets it.

01:17:42.928 --> 01:17:44.919
Well, it's not my sort of thing.

01:17:46.131 --> 01:17:48.565
Can I just say one thing?
That's our job.

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:52.192
I know you think you're above it
and, of course, you were above it

01:17:52.337 --> 01:17:55.465
before you got fired. But now,
guess what, you're down in the muck

01:17:55.607 --> 01:17:56.767
with the rest of us, Mike.

01:17:56.909 --> 01:18:00.072
And yet I still have standards,
unfortunately for you.

01:18:00.212 --> 01:18:02.578
- Suppose I don't have standards?
- Sure, you do.

01:18:02.714 --> 01:18:06.241
When you got your Pap smear on air,
you wore a silk robe.

01:18:06.385 --> 01:18:08.285
- OK!
- Classy touch.

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:09.853
- We're back in five...
- That is it!

01:18:09.988 --> 01:18:11.979
I've had it with you!
I've had it!

01:18:12.124 --> 01:18:14.251
- Three... and two...
- Go, two.

01:18:14.393 --> 01:18:16.327
...one.
- Dissolve and cue.

01:18:16.462 --> 01:18:19.989
Tomorrow on the show, Colleen will
make the British classic bangers

01:18:20.132 --> 01:18:23.624
- and mash, with chef Gordon Ramsay.
- That's right, I will,

01:18:23.769 --> 01:18:27.330
because you refuse to do it, Mike.
Guess it's beneath you.

01:18:27.473 --> 01:18:30.533
Well, that and it's tough to get
between you and a sausage, so...

01:18:30.676 --> 01:18:32.769
Sausage, that's a good one.

01:18:32.911 --> 01:18:37.143
Yes, and also you are
a fatuous, pretentious idiot,

01:18:37.282 --> 01:18:40.183
- so there's that.
- A fatuous idiot who makes

01:18:40.319 --> 01:18:44.016
- three times what you make.
- That's our show for this morning.

01:18:44.156 --> 01:18:48.183
See you tomorrow, folks. Goodbye.

01:18:48.327 --> 01:18:49.851
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:18:49.995 --> 01:18:51.155
- Goodbye.
- And goodbye.

01:18:51.296 --> 01:18:52.422
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

01:18:52.564 --> 01:18:54.088
- Yeah, no, no, no.
- Bye.

01:18:54.233 --> 01:18:56.463
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Bye.

01:18:56.602 --> 01:18:58.536
This is yesterday,

01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:00.501
- after she insulted his tie.
- Right.

01:19:00.639 --> 01:19:04.575
After he asked her if she cries
ice cubes. Huge spike.

01:19:05.143 --> 01:19:06.474
They love it!

01:19:06.612 --> 01:19:10.776
We're so close. I mean, we need this.
We're, we're, we're almost there.

01:19:10.916 --> 01:19:14.477
Coming up in our next hour, we'll be
talking to people who successfully

01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:16.679
completed this innovative
rehab program.

01:19:16.822 --> 01:19:19.382
Might want to pick up
a few tips there, Mike.

01:19:19.525 --> 01:19:24.224
Do they have rehab programs for bitter
beauty queens with self-esteem issues?

01:19:24.363 --> 01:19:26.661
I wonder about that sometimes.

01:19:26.798 --> 01:19:29.062
Sometimes. Well, coming up next...

01:19:29.201 --> 01:19:34.730
But they are way better.
They're way up from last year.

01:19:34.873 --> 01:19:38.707
I'm, I'm almost there.

01:19:38.844 --> 01:19:40.675
So many people rely on this show.
They believe in it.

01:19:40.812 --> 01:19:42.973
You have until Friday.
That's the deal we made.

01:19:43.115 --> 01:19:45.515
And those are still not good enough.

01:19:51.256 --> 01:19:54.692
...so no real flooding to speak of in
the neighborhoods. But the concern is,

01:19:54.826 --> 01:19:57.351
they are prepared...

01:19:57.496 --> 01:20:00.727
...to help folks if necessary, Kitty.
- What?

01:20:00.866 --> 01:20:03.426
Well, the center of
lowa's second biggest city,

01:20:03.569 --> 01:20:05.537
Cedar Rapids, is already underwater.

01:20:08.273 --> 01:20:09.535
Sorry.

01:20:12.144 --> 01:20:14.339
I mean, our demos are getting better.

01:20:14.479 --> 01:20:17.039
But our overall numbers, they're
just not where they should be.

01:20:18.584 --> 01:20:20.916
We're just missing... something.

01:20:21.053 --> 01:20:25.649
Well, maybe it's time for another
eight-part series on the orgasm.

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:28.123
Do you think so? I mean,

01:20:28.260 --> 01:20:31.423
I don't know what else we
would possibly talk about.

01:20:32.431 --> 01:20:34.661
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

01:20:38.604 --> 01:20:39.969
Never mind.

01:20:40.105 --> 01:20:41.902
Just... doesn't matter.

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.975
I'll just deal with it in the morning.

01:20:47.479 --> 01:20:51.609
You look at me like there's something
wrong with me all the time.

01:20:51.750 --> 01:20:53.911
- And I can't, I can't do it.
- What?

01:20:54.052 --> 01:20:56.486
That is the most ridiculous
statement you have ever made.

01:20:56.622 --> 01:20:58.590
I can't let my guard down
for one second, you know.

01:20:58.724 --> 01:21:02.854
I don't look at my BlackBerry and I miss
getting the next big story.

01:21:02.995 --> 01:21:07.261
And I'm tired of feeling guilty
about my work. I can't.

01:21:07.399 --> 01:21:08.798
Becky, wait a second.

01:21:23.382 --> 01:21:27.216
Yeah. OK. Look, that
information's a matter of public record.

01:21:27.352 --> 01:21:29.877
I have a right to see it.
You know that.

01:21:30.022 --> 01:21:32.388
You want me to come on down there
and I'll bring a crew?

01:21:32.524 --> 01:21:34.151
Better yet, a subpoena.

01:21:35.727 --> 01:21:38.059
OK, and I think we
should end the segment

01:21:38.196 --> 01:21:40.460
with Ernie being tarred and feathered
in honor of the anniversary

01:21:40.599 --> 01:21:41.691
of the Boston Tea Party.

01:21:41.833 --> 01:21:44.666
Or I could do my good story
on weathervanes.

01:21:44.803 --> 01:21:47.169
No!

01:21:47.305 --> 01:21:50.001
OK, so great job, everyone.

01:21:50.142 --> 01:21:54.306
Excuse me, excuse me.
Just one, one moment, please.

01:21:59.317 --> 01:22:01.649
I have a story I'd like to do.

01:22:03.889 --> 01:22:05.151
Sauerkraut.

01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:10.155
Sauerkraut?

01:22:11.329 --> 01:22:16.824
Big annual Sauerkraut Festival upstate.

01:22:17.536 --> 01:22:21.131
They bowl with cabbage,

01:22:21.273 --> 01:22:22.831
make a big sauerkraut cake.

01:22:22.974 --> 01:22:27.536
They... have a competition
for the best sauerkraut.

01:22:28.380 --> 01:22:30.848
You want to do that?

01:22:30.982 --> 01:22:33.678
What? Do you have
a problem with that?

01:22:36.388 --> 01:22:37.582
No.

01:22:37.723 --> 01:22:41.056
It's OK? I'm doing the kraut? Right?

01:22:41.193 --> 01:22:45.095
- If you, if you want to.
- Good. Good.

01:22:51.303 --> 01:22:52.292
Hi!

01:22:57.275 --> 01:22:59.209
- Hi!
- Don't really have to go, you know.

01:22:59.344 --> 01:23:01.141
I want to. My goodness.
I wouldn't miss this for...

01:23:01.279 --> 01:23:02.871
- Get in.
- All right.

01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:06.911
Say hello to Joe.

01:23:07.052 --> 01:23:09.850
- Joe, Becky. Becky, Joe. Go.
- Hi, Joe.

01:23:10.589 --> 01:23:14.491
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
This isn't the way. No, no.

01:23:14.626 --> 01:23:17.959
- Mike, where are we going?
- To cover the news.

01:23:18.096 --> 01:23:19.791
- What?
- At 8am this morning,

01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:21.626
- I'm going to cover a story.
- Mike.

01:23:21.767 --> 01:23:25.203
- A real story.
- Are you kidding me?

01:23:25.337 --> 01:23:26.964
- Where are you?
- I don't know.

01:23:27.105 --> 01:23:30.165
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- Well, he won't tell me.

01:23:30.308 --> 01:23:33.038
He's kidnapped me.
He's gone around some kind of bend

01:23:33.178 --> 01:23:35.908
and I need you to get Colleen ready
with a backup story, please!

01:23:36.047 --> 01:23:39.016
- What backup story?
- Let Ernie do the weathervane thing.

01:23:39.151 --> 01:23:41.176
- No, no, no, no. Jesus.
- I need something

01:23:41.319 --> 01:23:43.082
when Mike's story tanks.

01:23:43.989 --> 01:23:45.957
You know, you're a terrible person!

01:23:46.091 --> 01:23:49.788
You baited me with sauerkraut.
That's so low.

01:23:49.928 --> 01:23:52.089
I mean, what the hell
is this story, Mike?!

01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:54.664
- The governor.
- What governor?

01:23:54.800 --> 01:23:57.325
We're not even
anywhere near Albany.

01:23:57.469 --> 01:24:00.802
No, we're not.
It's up here a little further, Joe.

01:24:00.939 --> 01:24:02.873
- A little further.
- Oh, my God,

01:24:03.008 --> 01:24:05.306
this is the governor's country house.
Are you out of your mind?

01:24:05.443 --> 01:24:08.935
You're experiencing a psychotic break.
Are you insane?

01:24:09.948 --> 01:24:14.351
Well, I won't be dragged down with you.
You're gonna get us arrested and fired.

01:24:14.486 --> 01:24:17.512
I get fired, I never work again,
you lunatic.

01:24:17.656 --> 01:24:19.954
I'm not gonna run it, Mike.
I won't, you can't make me.

01:24:20.091 --> 01:24:23.549
I'll run Colleen getting her bikini
line waxed before I run it. Mike!

01:24:23.695 --> 01:24:25.595
They're gonna cancel the show!

01:24:31.002 --> 01:24:33.664
If we don't get our numbers up
by the end of this week, we're toast.

01:24:33.805 --> 01:24:37.673
We're gonna be replaced
by soap operas and... game shows.

01:24:41.379 --> 01:24:42.903
Come on, Joe.

01:24:46.418 --> 01:24:48.215
- Lenny, are you ready?
- Ready?

01:24:48.353 --> 01:24:50.753
- Ready? Ready for what?
- Jesus.

01:24:54.626 --> 01:24:56.093
- Check, check.
- Hey.

01:24:56.228 --> 01:24:58.162
You'll know when to go live.
Get out of my shot.

01:24:58.296 --> 01:25:00.287
Go live with what?

01:25:01.466 --> 01:25:03.195
Pomeroy!

01:25:03.335 --> 01:25:05.735
- Gary, how are ya?
- What the hell are you doin'here?

01:25:05.871 --> 01:25:07.338
I need the weathervanes, Lenny.

01:25:07.472 --> 01:25:09.702
- I need 'em, need...
- So we're goin' with weathervanes.

01:25:09.841 --> 01:25:10.830
- Yes.
- Specifically,

01:25:10.976 --> 01:25:14.434
we'd like to know how you feel about
the Attorney General's filing

01:25:14.579 --> 01:25:16.774
racketeering charges
against you this morning.

01:25:16.915 --> 01:25:19.042
- Charges of corruption...
- No, wait, wait.

01:25:19.184 --> 01:25:22.051
...and steering government contracts.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:25:22.187 --> 01:25:24.587
- We cannot wait!
- Hold your horses.

01:25:24.723 --> 01:25:28.420
And there's a hooker or two...
in there as well, isn't there, sir?

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:29.959
- Oh, my God.
- Becky!

01:25:30.095 --> 01:25:31.653
- What is going on here?
- Comin' through!

01:25:31.796 --> 01:25:34.458
Mike, I don't know where you get
your information. You know I like you.

01:25:34.599 --> 01:25:36.294
- Stand by to go live.
- What?

01:25:36.434 --> 01:25:40.097
...but if you don't leave,
I'm gonna have to call the police.

01:25:40.238 --> 01:25:42.103
- Wait one second.
- I don't think that's gonna

01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:43.798
be necessary, sir.

01:25:44.542 --> 01:25:46.339
Becky!

01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.441
Live! Live!

01:25:50.582 --> 01:25:51.708
Live to Becky, now!

01:25:54.753 --> 01:25:56.414
- Up on rem two!
- Now taking you live

01:25:56.554 --> 01:25:58.454
to Mike Pomeroy for a special report.

01:25:58.590 --> 01:26:02.583
Federal authorities have been
planning this raid for weeks.

01:26:02.727 --> 01:26:06.561
This reporter has learned that
the indictment contains 15 counts

01:26:06.698 --> 01:26:10.293
of racketeering
and using undue influence.

01:26:10.435 --> 01:26:14.462
My sources tell me authorities
have tapped phone calls,

01:26:14.606 --> 01:26:16.801
and incriminating e-mails.

01:26:19.344 --> 01:26:21.835
Mike Pomeroy, Daybreak.

01:26:23.381 --> 01:26:25.372
Back to you in the studio.

01:26:26.718 --> 01:26:28.583
- Take two.
- Thanks, Mike.

01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:30.984
Partly cloudy skies this afternoon
with slight chance...

01:26:31.122 --> 01:26:34.148
You know, you could have told me.
I might have covered it anyway.

01:26:34.292 --> 01:26:35.281
Liar.

01:26:39.631 --> 01:26:41.189
Look, I get it.

01:26:42.634 --> 01:26:45.899
Nobody really cares that
I can do this job, but...

01:26:49.307 --> 01:26:51.241
But I can.

01:26:52.777 --> 01:26:55.075
I wanted you to see that.

01:26:56.247 --> 01:26:57.942
That was a great story, Mike.

01:26:58.083 --> 01:27:00.381
That was...
that was better than a great story,

01:27:00.518 --> 01:27:05.922
that was great television.
I mean, that was bran with a doughnut.

01:27:06.057 --> 01:27:07.922
A bran doughnut.

01:27:11.529 --> 01:27:14.123
I've got a grandkid.

01:27:14.265 --> 01:27:17.098
Did you know that?

01:27:17.235 --> 01:27:18.930
Alexander.

01:27:20.138 --> 01:27:23.403
I haven't seen him since I got fired.

01:27:23.541 --> 01:27:27.409
I was embarrassed...
after all I'd accomplished.

01:27:27.545 --> 01:27:30.571
And then to...

01:27:31.683 --> 01:27:36.143
...come back to the news... this way.

01:27:39.491 --> 01:27:41.686
The truth is, I'd...

01:27:41.826 --> 01:27:44.659
I'd screwed up with my kids

01:27:44.796 --> 01:27:46.855
way before I got canned.

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:52.131
Anyway, I was never at home and...

01:27:53.204 --> 01:27:55.900
...when I was,
I took every phone call,

01:27:56.041 --> 01:27:58.942
watching TV out of the corner of my eye.

01:28:00.979 --> 01:28:06.007
Why am I telling you this?
You're worse than I am.

01:28:06.151 --> 01:28:09.086
You'd sleep at the office if you could.

01:28:13.858 --> 01:28:16.486
Let me tell you how it turns out.

01:28:17.829 --> 01:28:20.992
You end up with... with nothing.

01:28:21.933 --> 01:28:23.525
Nothing.

01:28:26.871 --> 01:28:30.864
Which is... which is what I had...

01:28:31.676 --> 01:28:33.803
...till you came along.

01:28:41.152 --> 01:28:43.382
Wait a second.

01:28:43.521 --> 01:28:46.319
Did you just say something nice to me?

01:28:47.826 --> 01:28:50.351
I told you I could banter.

01:28:53.098 --> 01:28:55.566
Felt like getting a jump on it.

01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:28.089
They're not... awful.

01:29:29.334 --> 01:29:30.858
How much longer can we get?

01:29:31.002 --> 01:29:34.096
Well, I have to check
with upstairs, but...

01:29:34.239 --> 01:29:39.370
with these I can get you a year,
a comfortable year.

01:29:39.511 --> 01:29:41.138
I underestimated you, Becky.

01:29:42.247 --> 01:29:45.375
That's... that's very, very true.

01:29:46.284 --> 01:29:47.945
NBC called.

01:29:49.454 --> 01:29:50.716
NBC?

01:29:51.723 --> 01:29:54.385
Wanted to know how much time
you have on your contract.

01:29:58.263 --> 01:30:00.823
The Today show wants you.

01:30:06.704 --> 01:30:09.730
Well, that's very flattering. I...

01:30:13.511 --> 01:30:15.274
Is that what you want?

01:30:46.277 --> 01:30:48.745
They were gonna cancel the show.

01:30:49.514 --> 01:30:51.277
- OK.
- Yeah.

01:30:51.416 --> 01:30:54.476
And somehow, we saved it.

01:30:54.619 --> 01:30:57.850
And, you know, the thing is...
is that the second I knew

01:30:57.989 --> 01:31:02.722
that everything was gonna be OK, the
person that I wanted to tell was you.

01:31:04.996 --> 01:31:08.329
The Today show? That's huge.

01:31:08.466 --> 01:31:12.027
Yeah, yeah,
it's, it's, it's incredible.

01:31:13.037 --> 01:31:15.562
But I, I have to think about it. I...

01:31:15.707 --> 01:31:18.141
- What?
- Well, yeah, I mean, I...

01:31:18.276 --> 01:31:22.372
Well, the thing is, is that at Daybreak,
everyone's really starting to click.

01:31:22.513 --> 01:31:24.913
Everybody's pitching in
and doing what they're best at.

01:31:25.049 --> 01:31:26.641
- No story too high or low.
- No, hold on,

01:31:26.784 --> 01:31:30.049
you can't say no to this.
When you get an opportunity like this,

01:31:30.188 --> 01:31:33.157
- you have to grab it.
- Even Mike is almost happy.

01:31:33.291 --> 01:31:36.454
And that's a good enough reason to
give up the best job in broadcasting?

01:31:36.594 --> 01:31:38.391
We're...

01:31:39.497 --> 01:31:43.160
Daybreak is a family now.

01:31:44.135 --> 01:31:47.434
Becky, I've known Mike a long time.

01:31:47.572 --> 01:31:49.563
I... It doesn't matter how happy he is.

01:31:49.707 --> 01:31:52.642
He's not just gonna suddenly
change into a different person.

01:31:52.777 --> 01:31:55.405
Well, I think you're wrong.

01:31:55.546 --> 01:31:58.071
I know what I'm doing with him now.

01:31:58.216 --> 01:32:01.652
I do. I do.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.713
It's gonna be great.

01:32:06.524 --> 01:32:09.550
So we've got the Supreme Court
Justice hearings at the top of the hour

01:32:09.694 --> 01:32:12.185
and then... I forgot
to tell you, Anthony Bourdain

01:32:12.330 --> 01:32:16.767
- wants to do a segment with you!
- Bourdain? Love him. Not doin' that.

01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:20.200
But say hi to Tony.
I owe him a bottle of Patron.

01:32:21.706 --> 01:32:24.470
- What?
- What? We do one good story together

01:32:24.609 --> 01:32:28.636
and suddenly I'm your bitch?
Don't think so. Sorry.

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:33.308
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.
You can't do one story for me?

01:32:33.451 --> 01:32:35.146
Oh, my God, what is wrong with me?

01:32:35.286 --> 01:32:37.618
What am I doing here,
beating my head against this wall?

01:32:37.755 --> 01:32:40.246
I might as well go to the Today
show where you don't have to poke

01:32:40.391 --> 01:32:42.655
- Matt Lauer with a stick...
- The Today show?

01:32:42.794 --> 01:32:44.887
- Yes, they offered me a job.
- Of course.

01:32:45.029 --> 01:32:47.520
- But you know what? I said...
- Time to move on.

01:32:47.665 --> 01:32:48.962
You'll love the Today show.

01:32:49.100 --> 01:32:52.263
You and Vieira can do
menopause stories every week!

01:32:52.403 --> 01:32:56.203
You know what's really ridiculous?
Is that until about ten seconds ago,

01:32:56.341 --> 01:32:59.742
I'd actually considered turning my back
on the best job I've ever been offered.

01:32:59.877 --> 01:33:01.742
Isn't that totally absurd?

01:33:03.581 --> 01:33:05.412
What's keeping you?

01:33:06.651 --> 01:33:08.278
OK.

01:33:08.419 --> 01:33:12.753
You know, if you'd ever treated me
with some kind of friendship or loyalty,

01:33:12.890 --> 01:33:16.382
or trust, these things
that you seem incapable of...

01:33:16.527 --> 01:33:20.827
You miserable, Ionely, egotistical,
selfish asshole!

01:33:44.389 --> 01:33:46.118
- Hey, Becky.
- Hi.

01:33:46.257 --> 01:33:49.385
They called again. Today show.

01:33:50.728 --> 01:33:52.286
Thanks.

01:34:53.458 --> 01:34:55.119
Becky Fuller.

01:34:55.259 --> 01:34:58.592
Obviously, we have a long
track record of success here

01:34:58.729 --> 01:35:03.098
at the Today show, but we're
always looking to stay current,

01:35:03.234 --> 01:35:07.034
to get out of our comfort zone,
and we want the show

01:35:07.171 --> 01:35:10.868
to have that youthful energy.
And we are so impressed

01:35:11.008 --> 01:35:13.306
with what you have done
with Daybreak.

01:35:13.878 --> 01:35:17.336
Well, thank you very much.
I appreciate it.

01:35:18.182 --> 01:35:20.480
Everyone is talking about it.
You must know that.

01:35:20.618 --> 01:35:23.781
I mean, you have done an amazing job
of revitalizing a show

01:35:23.921 --> 01:35:26.719
that many people
had just completely written off.

01:35:26.858 --> 01:35:29.053
Well, thank you. Thanks.

01:35:29.193 --> 01:35:30.820
And we're out!

01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:34.630
You did this.

01:35:34.765 --> 01:35:36.460
They're gonna hire her.

01:35:36.601 --> 01:35:39.798
Yeah. She's at the Today show
right now, ding dong.

01:35:39.937 --> 01:35:44.033
Do you have any idea, you know,
what you've done here?

01:35:44.175 --> 01:35:48.441
Because we had a decent producer,
a decent show and,

01:35:48.579 --> 01:35:50.513
God forbid, anyone around here
should be happy,

01:35:50.648 --> 01:35:53.981
but you had to have this happen,
didn't you?

01:35:54.118 --> 01:35:55.244
All right, stand by, folks. Here we go.

01:35:55.386 --> 01:35:57.445
Three, two, one.

01:35:57.588 --> 01:36:01.547
And dissolve two.
And cue 'em! Cue 'em!

01:36:01.692 --> 01:36:04.684
- Welcome back to Daybreak.
- What is wrong?

01:36:04.829 --> 01:36:06.421
...at the nation's
crumbling infrastructure.

01:36:06.564 --> 01:36:07.895
Go to Colleen.
Jesus, jump off Mike.

01:36:08.032 --> 01:36:09.522
- Where the hell is he going?
- Take three, three.

01:36:10.368 --> 01:36:14.304
Cue over to three. Swing her to three,
please. Come on, Jane, over to three.

01:36:14.438 --> 01:36:17.134
Sorry, the... this segment's
usually a two shot

01:36:17.275 --> 01:36:20.176
of Mike and Colleen
and Mike's not there.

01:36:21.546 --> 01:36:24.606
They've probably just
changed something. Sorry.

01:36:25.550 --> 01:36:27.677
I don't know. Where is Mike?

01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:31.188
- I need eggs.
- You need what?

01:36:31.322 --> 01:36:33.722
You know, from chickens. Eggs!

01:36:35.826 --> 01:36:38.556
Really don't enjoy this job.

01:36:38.696 --> 01:36:41.722
Chinese people, move, move, move!

01:36:41.866 --> 01:36:43.925
Thank you!

01:36:44.068 --> 01:36:48.698
Celery. Peppers. Cheese. Cheese.

01:36:52.577 --> 01:36:54.374
Yeah, thank you very much.

01:36:55.212 --> 01:36:57.806
We wanted to know what your plans
are for sports coverage.

01:36:57.949 --> 01:37:00.850
Sports. Great, OK.
Great.

01:37:00.985 --> 01:37:03.749
I love sports.

01:37:03.888 --> 01:37:06.823
Come on, move, move!
Let's go, let's go!

01:37:06.958 --> 01:37:09.483
- Get it in there, slide it in!
- Mike, tell us what you need.

01:37:09.627 --> 01:37:14.655
I need a cutting board, good knife,
nice plate, bowl, whisk.

01:37:14.799 --> 01:37:17.393
What is this, rubber?
Get me a real bowl.

01:37:17.535 --> 01:37:19.127
- Where are my eggs?!
- Cue over to three.

01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:22.239
- Where are my goddamn eggs?!
- Eggs for Mike, please!

01:37:22.373 --> 01:37:25.570
In respect to sports, I think that it's
really important to reach out

01:37:25.710 --> 01:37:28.372
to women through their kids
because it's not that big of a step

01:37:28.512 --> 01:37:32.039
to go from being a soccer mom
to, you know, a...

01:37:33.184 --> 01:37:34.742
Oh, my God. What is he doing?

01:37:38.789 --> 01:37:40.279
Sorry, I just...

01:37:40.424 --> 01:37:44.520
This is... Mike Pomeroy is having
a nervous breakdown on air.

01:37:44.662 --> 01:37:45.993
That's kind of big news.

01:37:46.130 --> 01:37:48.496
...a meal for their afternoon repast,

01:37:48.633 --> 01:37:52.160
something they could make
using whatever ingredients

01:37:52.303 --> 01:37:55.170
- they had available.
- Holy shit.

01:37:55.306 --> 01:38:00.141
I've been making frittata
for about 20 years now,

01:38:00.277 --> 01:38:03.212
ever since I was taught how to,

01:38:03.347 --> 01:38:06.441
on a naked weekend
with a beautiful Italian movie star,

01:38:06.584 --> 01:38:09.883
who shall, of course,
remain nameless.

01:38:10.021 --> 01:38:13.252
Occasionally, I make them at home.

01:38:14.125 --> 01:38:17.322
But only for people that I...

01:38:17.461 --> 01:38:19.053
People I really care about.

01:38:20.931 --> 01:38:24.332
Now the key to a great frittata

01:38:24.468 --> 01:38:26.834
is a very hot pan,

01:38:26.971 --> 01:38:29.769
because that, my friends,

01:38:30.675 --> 01:38:34.975
is what makes it... fluffy.

01:38:37.048 --> 01:38:39.380
We'll let this firm up a little bit.

01:38:43.387 --> 01:38:45.912
- Dash of pepper.
- I'm sorry. I...

01:38:47.992 --> 01:38:49.357
You watchin' this?

01:38:52.229 --> 01:38:56.393
- Becky?
- Yes, I... yeah.

01:38:56.534 --> 01:38:58.434
He is not gonna ask you twice.

01:38:58.569 --> 01:39:01.561
We'll give it a few seconds,
then we'll pop it in the hot oven.

01:39:03.007 --> 01:39:04.599
Bye! Thanks!

01:39:13.150 --> 01:39:14.674
A little pepper.

01:39:25.396 --> 01:39:28.024
Stand by. He's goin' back to the oven.
Ready three.

01:39:36.707 --> 01:39:40.165
A lot of people like a glass of di Gavi.

01:39:40.311 --> 01:39:42.302
Gavi di Gavi, perhaps.

01:39:42.446 --> 01:39:45.904
I, myself, like a... Barolo.

01:39:54.658 --> 01:39:56.853
I'll just free up the edges.

01:40:20.818 --> 01:40:23.719
Next week on the show,
I'll show you how to make

01:40:23.854 --> 01:40:26.414
a fantastic beignet,

01:40:26.557 --> 01:40:28.752
which the rabble like to call...

01:40:30.995 --> 01:40:31.984
...doughnuts.

01:40:37.168 --> 01:40:39.261
The old bastard.

01:40:41.672 --> 01:40:45.631
You know, he's still the
third worst person in the world.

01:40:47.945 --> 01:40:49.879
Yeah, I know.

01:40:53.684 --> 01:40:55.117
That's good.

01:40:58.122 --> 01:41:00.454
That's really good.

01:41:00.591 --> 01:41:03.526
I want a tropical fruit plate.

01:42:04.722 --> 01:42:08.385
"His gravity leavens
the silliness of morning TV,

01:42:08.525 --> 01:42:12.723
making for an incongruous
but somehow perfect match.

01:42:12.863 --> 01:42:15.388
Turns out that after 40 years
in the business,

01:42:15.532 --> 01:42:18.695
the real Mike Pomeroy
has finally arrived."

01:42:18.836 --> 01:42:19.928
Not bad.

01:42:20.070 --> 01:42:23.198
By the way, I'm getting
my prostate checked next week.

01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.331
I thought I'd take a crew with me.

01:42:25.476 --> 01:42:28.172
- That's a great idea. We...
- Jesus, I'm kidding.

01:42:28.312 --> 01:42:31.611
No, seriously, they have these
little teeny, tiny cameras

01:42:31.749 --> 01:42:33.546
- that go right up your...
- No, no, no.

01:42:33.684 --> 01:42:35.675
What if we got you
a body double?

01:42:37.655 --> 01:42:39.054
- No!
- No?

01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:41.316
Not in a thousand years.

01:42:42.305 --> 01:42:48.194
