00:02.961 --> 00:06.755
Why is everybody using
these tiny, little lights nowadays?

00:07.007 --> 00:09.049
I remember when people used big ones.

00:09.259 --> 00:11.760
That's a good story, Grandpa.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.347
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:15.598 --> 00:19.601
Wow. Monica's letting other people
help decorate her tree?

00:19.853 --> 00:22.062
Did someone get her
drunk again, or?

00:23.773 --> 00:26.859
Having a perfect tree is
not what Christmas is about.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.986
It's about being with loved ones.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.697
That is nice. And we're done.
Ta-da!

00:33.867 --> 00:37.036
It just doesn't quite
feel like Christmas to me.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.621
Oh, here.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.668
See, now it feels like Christmas.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.962
And that's the story of the dreidel.

01:31.132 --> 01:35.010
Some people trace the Christmas tree
back to the Egyptians...

01:35.220 --> 01:39.932
...who'd bring palm branches into huts
on the shortest day of the year...

01:40.183 --> 01:42.726
...symbolizing life's
triumph over death.

01:42.977 --> 01:45.896
And that was, like, 4000 years ago.

01:46.147 --> 01:49.775
So around the same time
that you started telling this story.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.364
- Hey, you guys.
- Hey. What's up?

01:55.615 --> 01:59.868
I had to get out of the apartment.
Janine's stretching all over the place.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.121
Everywhere I look she's like...

02:06.417 --> 02:09.002
I can see why that's hard to resist.

02:09.503 --> 02:11.463
I like her so much.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.507
I'm sorry she doesn't feel the same.

02:13.758 --> 02:15.467
I know. And she's so sweet.

02:15.718 --> 02:19.429
I just want to feed her grapes
and brush her hair.

02:20.431 --> 02:23.058
You are aware that she's
not a monkey, right?

02:25.687 --> 02:28.689
I am so over Janine.

02:29.399 --> 02:34.403
Yeah, at first I thought she was hot,
but now she's like old news.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.364
- Hey, guys.
- Janine!

02:39.951 --> 02:42.995
I'm gonna be a dancer on a TV special
for New Year's Eve.

02:43.246 --> 02:47.166
It's called some sort of
Dickin' Rockin' Dicky Eve.

02:50.128 --> 02:51.545
Hold it.

02:52.046 --> 02:55.507
Are you talking about
Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve?

02:55.758 --> 02:57.593
Yeah, that's what I said.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.015
Oh, my God, we love that show!

03:03.266 --> 03:06.268
Ross and I have been watching it
since I can remember.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.897
You're still just a little
fat girl inside, aren't you?

03:12.025 --> 03:14.651
I'm gonna be one of the party people.

03:14.986 --> 03:19.698
You're gonna be a party person?
Those guys rock the most!

03:20.116 --> 03:23.493
They said to bring someone.
Want to be my dance partner?

03:23.745 --> 03:26.455
I would love to spend
New Year's with you.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.458
They're taping tomorrow.
I don't understand why...

03:29.709 --> 03:31.168
Well, how it works is...

03:31.377 --> 03:35.172
...the part with Dick Clark
in Times Square is actually live.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.467
But they tape some of the party stuff
ahead of time.

03:38.718 --> 03:41.053
Not a lot of people know that.

03:42.513 --> 03:44.139
Do you guys want to come too?

03:44.933 --> 03:48.060
- Are you serious?
- We are there!

03:51.564 --> 03:53.232
What are you laughing at?

03:53.483 --> 03:57.402
Well, I used to date him,
but you're still going out with her.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.866
Thanks.
Great, so we can all go together.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.077
I gotta run. I'll catch you later.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.663
Bye, Janine.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.625
Did she just ask me out on a date?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.544
I don't think so.

04:14.837 --> 04:18.173
She invited him to the biggest
party of the millennium.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.926
Yeah, but she also invited
you and Ross.

04:21.177 --> 04:24.388
I'm sorry, I don't think that
that was a romantic thing.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.516
Well, maybe.
But, hey, I know how I can find out.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.476
It's a New Year's Eve party.

04:29.727 --> 04:34.147
So at midnight, I can kiss her.
And if she kisses me back, great.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.192
If she says, "What are you doing?"

04:37.443 --> 04:40.195
I can say, "It wasn't me,
it was New Year's."

04:42.240 --> 04:44.908
That's better than Ross
kissing me in high school...

04:45.159 --> 04:48.745
...and saying that he did it
because he needed Chap Stick.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.874
It was a dry day.

04:56.254 --> 05:00.632
We are going to Dick Clark's
New Year's Rockin' Eve!

05:00.883 --> 05:07.222
Oh, my God!

05:14.564 --> 05:16.606
Okay, I've been on sets before...

05:16.858 --> 05:18.567
...so let me give you some advice.

05:18.776 --> 05:22.154
It's a show, but we're just dancing.
It's no big deal.

05:22.405 --> 05:25.449
Important thing to remember:
Stay cool.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.326
- Got it.
- Okay.

05:27.910 --> 05:30.662
Oh, my God!
It's just like I dreamed it!

05:31.998 --> 05:33.290
Everyone! Gather up!

05:34.167 --> 05:36.293
- Excuse us!
- Excuse us!

05:37.420 --> 05:40.088
The music's gonna start,
you're gonna dance...

05:40.340 --> 05:43.425
...we'll tape it. Don't look
at the camera. Questions?

05:43.676 --> 05:47.346
Uh, yeah, I have a question.
Uh, when is this gonna air?

05:48.806 --> 05:51.350
Yeah. Now, uh, you guys dance
over there...

05:51.601 --> 05:54.353
...you guys, over there.
I want you two here.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.521
- And everyone else, spread out.
- Ross.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.484
So when is it gonna air?

06:05.698 --> 06:07.991
You look in the kitchen,
I got the closet.

06:08.242 --> 06:11.536
I can save you time, ladies.
I'm right here.

06:12.413 --> 06:16.541
Yeah. Why don't you take a walk?
This doesn't concern you.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.087
We're looking for our presents
from Monica.

06:20.338 --> 06:21.588
That's terrible.

06:21.839 --> 06:23.465
No, we do it every year.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.134
Oh, well, that makes it not terrible.

06:27.678 --> 06:29.179
Yeah, we never find them.

06:29.430 --> 06:33.266
She's always bested us,
that wily... minx.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.144
We'll search here for an hour...

06:36.354 --> 06:39.064
...and then we'll go to Joey's
and search, okay?

06:39.315 --> 06:42.651
- You can't look for Monica's presents.
- We have to.

06:42.860 --> 06:46.988
You don't have to. And you can't,
because I live here too.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.826
Well, then you should look with us.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.411
Why?

06:52.662 --> 06:55.372
Aren't you worried about
what to get Monica?

06:55.623 --> 06:57.833
No, I have a great idea
for her present.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.044
Oh, that's it?
A great idea? Oh, yeah?

07:02.213 --> 07:04.840
What if she gets you
a great present...

07:05.091 --> 07:07.217
...two mediums
and lots of little ones...

07:07.427 --> 07:10.595
...and you just get her one present?
She'll feel bad.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.390
Why would you do that to her?
Why? Why?

07:15.393 --> 07:17.519
- If I help, we can find them faster!
- Right!

07:19.147 --> 07:21.189
Ooh! Ooh! We have a live one!

07:21.399 --> 07:24.109
- Oh, it's a Macy's bag!
- Yeah.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.654
- Aw!
- Ooh! Who's it for?

07:29.407 --> 07:33.535
"Dear Losers, do you really think
I'd hide presents under the couch?

07:35.246 --> 07:37.581
P.S. Chandler,
I knew they'd break you."

07:40.918 --> 07:43.503
Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

07:44.380 --> 07:47.382
We are so gonna find them this year.

07:47.633 --> 07:51.428
You said you'd go across the hall
and look. Do you do that every year?

07:51.679 --> 07:52.721
Yeah.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.640
You don't go into the back
of my closet...

07:55.892 --> 07:58.268
...and look under my gym bag
or anything?

07:59.854 --> 08:01.480
- No. Never do that.
- No.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.736
That's where Joey gave me stuff
to store that I've never seen.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.491
Okay, that did not just happen.

08:20.666 --> 08:21.708
Here comes a camera.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.003
Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.722
- Why do they keep doing that?
- Ugh!

08:36.974 --> 08:39.808
We have to get up on one
of those platforms.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.770
They've been taping them all day.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.145
Right.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.362
What'd you guys do
to get up on there?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.155
We learned how to dance.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.118
When you learned to dance, did you
forget how to put on underpants?

08:57.286 --> 08:58.328
Yeah!

09:02.625 --> 09:05.585
- Hey, you're a good dancer.
- Really?

09:05.836 --> 09:08.004
You'd be better if you
loosened your hips.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.882
- What do you mean?
- Like this.

09:12.718 --> 09:16.471
That's it. Feel the rhythm.
That's better.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.973
Uh-huh.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.892
You're dancing with her.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.645
- We're together.
- Yeah, we came together.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.897
I don't see it.

09:26.816 --> 09:30.277
You are dancing with the tall guy.
Tall Guy, raise your hand!

09:31.404 --> 09:36.032
Hey, buddy. Let me dance with her.
I like her and I think I have a shot.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.410
Really, you think so? I don't.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.388
I couldn't find anything...
Hey, wait!

09:58.639 --> 09:59.764
Yeah, we found them.

10:00.016 --> 10:02.058
They were in the guest room closet.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.395
You have nothing to worry about
because they're crap.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.275
Those are mine.
I got those for you.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.947
Oh. Thanks, Chandler, they're great!

10:18.159 --> 10:21.453
Chandler, what is this very weird, um,
metal A-Z thing?

10:21.704 --> 10:24.873
Those are bookends.
That's a great gift.

10:25.124 --> 10:28.293
Oh. Okay, I'm sorry.
Thank you for my "az."

10:31.047 --> 10:33.965
Make sure you put all that stuff
back in the closet.

10:34.216 --> 10:35.467
Yes, okay.

10:35.718 --> 10:40.221
By the way, I think it's really nice
of you that even after you moved...

10:40.473 --> 10:43.224
...you still keep storing
that stuff for Joey.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.825
Hey, dancing girl?

11:02.453 --> 11:04.371
Can I go to the bathroom?

11:06.624 --> 11:08.541
Here we go. Yeah.

11:13.839 --> 11:15.256
Looking good, Gellers!

11:16.467 --> 11:17.926
We know!

11:19.679 --> 11:23.264
That snippy guy's the one who
decides who gets on the platform.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.225
- We should go dance by him.
- Okay.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.235
Okay, everybody, hold!

11:37.071 --> 11:39.823
Next on the platforms are...

11:43.869 --> 11:46.579
- You two! And...
- Yes!

11:48.874 --> 11:50.500
- You two!
- Cool!

11:50.751 --> 11:52.335
Excuse me? Sir?

11:52.586 --> 11:55.255
Would it help if I weren't
wearing underpants?

11:56.173 --> 11:57.215
Would it?

12:04.432 --> 12:07.142
Hey, Tall Guy!

12:08.436 --> 12:11.521
I want to talk to you about that girl
you're dancing with.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.483
She's nice, huh? To think I almost
brought my wife to this.

12:16.193 --> 12:19.154
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.284
Look, I came with that girl, okay?

12:24.535 --> 12:27.203
I plan to kiss her
at the New Year's countdown.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.164
I'm trying to win her over. I...

12:29.415 --> 12:30.915
I don't think so.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.001
You can dance with my partner.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.295
She's real mellow.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.133
Look, you dating this girl
you came with?

12:40.384 --> 12:42.844
I was hoping after tonight
that maybe...

12:43.095 --> 12:46.347
No. No. She's fair game
if you ask me. Sorry, buddy.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.016
All right. Hey.

12:48.434 --> 12:52.604
Fair is fair. When you're right,
you're right. What can I say?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.689
Hey! Oh, no.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.568
Are you in second grade?

12:58.903 --> 13:01.571
Hey, man. You're the one
who wet his pants.

13:02.406 --> 13:03.448
Hey!

13:09.580 --> 13:10.830
Man, this sucks.

13:11.081 --> 13:14.334
If Mom and Dad don't see us
on TV after we made them jealous...

13:14.585 --> 13:16.795
...then who's gonna be
the losers then?

13:18.506 --> 13:22.383
- I know what'll get us up on a platform.
- What?

13:23.135 --> 13:24.677
The routine!

13:26.263 --> 13:29.098
We haven't done the routine
since middle school.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.726
When the snippy guy
sees the routine...

13:31.977 --> 13:34.437
...he'll want to build us
our own platform.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.939
Was it that good?

13:36.190 --> 13:40.276
We got honorable mention in the
brother-sister dance category!

13:40.528 --> 13:44.030
It's almost fake midnight.
Do we really have any other choice?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.450
Okay, let's do it.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.995
Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

13:57.503 --> 13:59.587
Five, six, seven, eight!

14:41.422 --> 14:45.925
So do we really need to ask who's
going up on the platform next?

14:46.218 --> 14:49.137
You get up there and do that
again, exactly like that.

14:49.680 --> 14:50.847
- Yeah!
- Ooh!

14:52.975 --> 14:56.060
Get this. Dick will want
it for the Bloopers show.

14:57.104 --> 14:59.814
All right, cut!
Listen up, everyone!

15:00.024 --> 15:02.191
When we start,
it'll be the countdown...

15:02.443 --> 15:05.445
...so I want to see
everybody's excitement!

15:05.821 --> 15:07.030
Hey, guy!

15:07.281 --> 15:09.282
You got three seconds to get away.

15:09.533 --> 15:10.867
What's going on here?

15:11.118 --> 15:13.244
Take a look at the guy's pants!

15:14.038 --> 15:18.041
You told us to show excitement,
but don't you think he went overboard?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.294
What's the matter with you? Go!

15:21.503 --> 15:23.546
Yeah, take a hike, wet pants!

15:26.175 --> 15:27.467
Can you believe this?

15:27.718 --> 15:29.719
We're on the platform
for the millennial moment!

15:29.887 --> 15:30.929
I know!

15:31.722 --> 15:34.557
You haven't been practicing
the routine, have you?

15:34.934 --> 15:36.517
No.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.228
Me too!

15:40.147 --> 15:41.564
When the music starts...

15:41.815 --> 15:44.859
...I was thinking about maybe
going into the robot.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.783
Ross? We should stick to the routine.
We don't want to look stupid.

15:53.869 --> 15:56.496
All right, we're back!
Ten seconds left.

15:56.747 --> 16:00.875
- Ten.
- Nine, eight, seven.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.461
Okay, it all comes down to this.

16:03.712 --> 16:06.756
Whatever happens, happens.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.050
Destiny.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.303
Three, two, one!

16:12.554 --> 16:14.305
- Cut!
- No!

16:16.517 --> 16:18.267
- Year!

16:18.519 --> 16:21.145
Happy No Year!

16:22.690 --> 16:26.359
Now we go to the live shot
of Times Square. That's a wrap!

16:39.373 --> 16:40.540
Hey, look who I found.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.208
Oh, hi, guys!

16:42.918 --> 16:45.336
Birds have a very good
sense of direction.

16:45.587 --> 16:48.464
I thought maybe they could help us
find the presents.

16:49.550 --> 16:53.052
Yes, if the presents are hidden
south for the winter.

16:53.512 --> 16:57.724
Or we could just follow your clever
jokes. Any ideas? Didn't think so.

16:59.476 --> 17:01.978
Come on, show us where
the presents are.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.189
The duck seems to think that
Monica got me garbage.

17:05.441 --> 17:09.234
I wonder what I could get Monica
that's as good as garbage.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.695
Hmm. How about my "az"?

17:16.367 --> 17:20.079
- Hey. This is hollow.
- What?

17:20.329 --> 17:24.125
This bench, it's hollow.
I can't believe I never knew that!

17:25.877 --> 17:29.047
- Oh, the presents!
- Don't look directly at them!

17:31.050 --> 17:32.091
What?

17:32.342 --> 17:34.761
All right, no, we could look at them.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.429
This one's for me!

17:36.638 --> 17:38.931
This one's for Chandler. Here.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.685
- And the big one's for me!
- Oh, let's open them!

17:43.896 --> 17:47.065
- Wait a minute. We can't do this.
- Why?

17:47.316 --> 17:50.610
I don't want to know
what Monica got me.

17:50.819 --> 17:54.572
I'm sure she worked hard at getting it
and wanting to surprise me.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.783
And you guys are gonna ruin that.

17:57.034 --> 18:00.369
We have to put them back.
This isn't what Christmas is about.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.831
Whatever, Linus.
I'm opening mine.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.004
Nobody is opening anything, okay?

18:10.297 --> 18:14.008
I want to see the look on her face
when I give her my present.

18:14.259 --> 18:17.762
I'm sure she wants to see the look
on my face when I get mine.

18:18.013 --> 18:21.808
So, please, please, can we just?
Can we put them back?

18:22.810 --> 18:25.228
- Will you get us better gifts?
- Fine.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.981
Hey, guys.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.693
You found the presents?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.113
You let them find the presents?

18:35.280 --> 18:36.322
Great.

18:36.490 --> 18:40.451
Do you know how long it took me
to find you that water purifier?

18:41.370 --> 18:44.997
- That's what you got me?
- Yes, I see. That look is priceless.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.798
Home sweet home, huh?

18:54.633 --> 18:57.677
Nice to, uh, get back to reality.

18:59.429 --> 19:02.974
Plus, we, uh, know how the New Year's
gonna go off.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.769
I guess there's no reason for all
that Y2K panic, you know?

19:08.730 --> 19:10.481
Anyway, good night.

19:11.358 --> 19:12.984
- Joey?
- Yeah?

19:15.571 --> 19:16.946
Three...

19:17.406 --> 19:19.448
...two, one.

19:26.957 --> 19:28.374
Happy New Year.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.755
What was that for?

19:35.257 --> 19:38.426
Tonight when they yelled "cut"
and we didn't get to kiss...

19:38.635 --> 19:42.597
...I was really, really disappointed,
and I just...

19:43.098 --> 19:45.099
I just really wanted to kiss you.

19:45.559 --> 19:46.976
Really?

19:48.437 --> 19:52.440
In the moment, I really wanted
to kiss you too. In the moment.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.359
- In the moment.
- But only in the moment.

19:57.487 --> 20:01.616
So do you, uh, want to kiss again?

20:02.451 --> 20:05.536
Sure. New Year's Eve
is only two weeks away.

20:05.954 --> 20:06.996
Can you wait?

20:07.456 --> 20:08.873
No.

20:10.751 --> 20:11.959
Me neither.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.924
Three, two...

20:18.175 --> 20:20.468
You don't have to count down
every time we kiss.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.637
Oh. Okay.

20:23.680 --> 20:28.684
Except I sort of felt like I needed
a couple seconds to get ready.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.920
We were on the platform, ready to
dance into the new millennium...

20:56.129 --> 20:58.839
...and the guy yells "cut!"

20:59.925 --> 21:02.843
So you guys are telling me
that you actually did...

21:03.095 --> 21:05.513
...the routine from eighth grade?

21:06.014 --> 21:09.600
Yeah! But of course we had
to update it a little bit.

21:09.851 --> 21:12.812
Hey, by the way, quick thinking
about catching me.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.691
There's no way you could've
done the end...

21:16.942 --> 21:19.318
...the way you guys did it back then.

21:20.279 --> 21:23.781
What? We could do it.

21:24.032 --> 21:28.995
I don't know. You were a lot bigger...
I mean, stronger back then.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.540
I can do it, okay?

21:33.000 --> 21:35.334
Come on, let's go! Come on.

21:36.586 --> 21:38.296
One, two, three, four...

21:38.964 --> 21:41.090
...five, six, seven, eight.

21:41.341 --> 21:42.508
- I can't do it!
- Ahh!

21:45.178 --> 21:48.472
Now, you do that, you're on TV.
