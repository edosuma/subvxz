00:02.860 --> 00:05.659
(Hoyt)
You're gonna forget about
what you've seen at the plant.

00:05.730 --> 00:07.925
They've got men working
in every department...

00:07.999 --> 00:09.967
forcing them to steal
new car parts.

00:10.035 --> 00:13.664
Yeah, and then they wholesale
them out to car dealers
and auto parts stores, right?

00:13.738 --> 00:15.535
We've got one big problem.

00:15.607 --> 00:17.074
Can l help you
with anything?

00:17.142 --> 00:18.507
We call him Mayhem.

00:18.577 --> 00:20.875
All right. You want a war?
We'll give you a war.

00:20.946 --> 00:22.174
Suit yourself.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.549
Nobody sticks his hand
into my candy jar
and gets away with it.

00:28.620 --> 00:30.679
Okay. You guys ready?
Ready, Hannibal.

00:32.591 --> 00:35.788
Well, l had to look the part.
l didn't want to get picked up
for car theft.

00:35.861 --> 00:37.886
(guard)
You're under arrest
for grand theft.

00:37.963 --> 00:39.487
This is an emergency.

00:40.499 --> 00:42.524
...for a while.
lt's going to get hairy
around here.

00:42.601 --> 00:44.034
He's gonna get us killed!

00:45.570 --> 00:48.004
We really outdid
ourselves this time.

00:49.975 --> 00:52.409
(male narrator)
In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:52.477 --> 00:54.274
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:54.346 --> 00:55.836
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:55.914 --> 00:57.142
These men promptly escaped...

00:57.215 --> 00:58.773
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:58.850 --> 01:00.477
to the Los Angeles
underground.

01:00.552 --> 01:02.179
Today, still wanted
by the government...

01:02.254 --> 01:04.188
they survive
as soldiers of fortune.

01:04.256 --> 01:06.690
If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...

01:06.758 --> 01:08.123
and if you can find them...

01:08.193 --> 01:10.286
maybe you can hire
the A-Team.

04:37.602 --> 04:39.627
(Hoyt)
We've been keeping an eye
on you, Rudy.

04:39.704 --> 04:41.171
You've been real busy.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.400
We did this little search...

04:44.275 --> 04:46.766
found this notebook
in your locker.

04:48.580 --> 04:51.242
lt says that
you're gonna tell
a lot of people...

04:51.316 --> 04:53.807
about what's been goin' on
at the auto plant.

04:53.885 --> 04:54.874
[sighs]

04:54.953 --> 04:56.887
(Rudy)
l got nothing to say.

04:56.955 --> 04:59.480
Well, Rudy, you and l
see things differently.

04:59.557 --> 05:02.185
You see, l think
you got a lot to say.

05:02.627 --> 05:06.529
Like saying
you're gonna forget about
what you've seen at the plant.

05:09.501 --> 05:12.698
l'm the foreman.
l know what you're doing
with the workers.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.296
l know what you did
with Charlie was no accident.

05:15.373 --> 05:17.773
Charlie never learned
to look the other way.

05:17.842 --> 05:18.900
Now he's dead.

05:18.977 --> 05:21.070
Now he's looking
the other way.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.909
[all laughing]

05:25.150 --> 05:26.947
You see what happens?

05:27.452 --> 05:29.283
You take an ex-con
like Rudy here...

05:29.354 --> 05:32.721
you make him a foreman,
suddenly he thinks
he's too good for us.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.884
Probably thinks we're scum.

05:34.993 --> 05:36.585
[all chuckle]

05:39.831 --> 05:41.298
Maybe we are.

05:41.666 --> 05:42.894
[groans]

05:48.573 --> 05:50.768
l want no part of this.

05:52.310 --> 05:53.902
Rudy, Rudy.

05:55.280 --> 05:57.407
And you got
a pretty wife.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.847
l've seen her.

05:59.117 --> 06:03.349
Seen her and the kid
when they come to pick you up
after work sometimes.

06:03.421 --> 06:06.356
That's a cute little girl
you got there, too.
What's her name?

06:06.424 --> 06:09.791
God help you if you put
one finger on her.

06:10.261 --> 06:13.128
Rudy, it's up to you.

06:13.364 --> 06:17.357
You just back off,
be a good little worker,
and nobody gets hurt.

06:17.769 --> 06:22.001
And just to make sure
that you understand
that very clearly....

06:22.507 --> 06:23.735
[groans]

07:12.657 --> 07:14.215
[siren wailing]

07:37.448 --> 07:39.712
See your driver's license
and registration, please?

07:39.784 --> 07:41.046
Yes, sir.

07:45.556 --> 07:46.955
Here you go.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.786
You're Mr. Rudy Garcia?

07:48.860 --> 07:50.122
Yes, sir.

07:50.228 --> 07:52.389
And is this
your current address?

07:52.463 --> 07:53.930
That's right.

07:54.365 --> 07:56.333
And where are you employed,
Mr. Garcia?

07:56.401 --> 07:59.165
At the National Auto Plant
in Van Nuys.

08:02.373 --> 08:04.807
You failed to come
to a complete stop...

08:04.876 --> 08:07.572
at the stop sign
back there on Elm Street.

08:07.779 --> 08:10.475
l never noticed
that sign there before.
Yeah.

08:11.249 --> 08:13.149
That's what
most people say.

08:13.217 --> 08:14.775
Of course, it...

08:15.320 --> 08:18.619
could be taken care of,
if you know what l mean?

08:21.459 --> 08:24.394
l'd rather take the ticket.
Suit yourself.

08:25.830 --> 08:27.923
lf you'd sign here, please?

08:31.970 --> 08:33.494
l don't believe it.

08:33.571 --> 08:35.539
l like an honest man,
Mr. Garcia.

08:50.788 --> 08:52.153
Follow us.

08:54.025 --> 08:57.188
So they killed this guy
in a two ton metal press?

08:57.628 --> 09:01.189
lt was so clean no one
could tell it was anything
but an accident.

09:01.265 --> 09:05.258
l mean,
these guys are real careful,
and l don't know who they are.

09:05.336 --> 09:06.894
l've never seen them before.

09:06.971 --> 09:09.872
But l do know that
they've got men working
in every department...

09:09.941 --> 09:14.207
forcing them to steal
new car parts that are
supposed to go into the cars.

09:14.278 --> 09:18.180
Yeah and then they wholesale
them out to car dealers
and auto parts stores, right?

09:18.249 --> 09:19.477
Clever.

09:21.152 --> 09:24.087
l did some time in jail
on a big mistake l made once.

09:24.155 --> 09:25.850
Now l'm trying
to clean up my act.

09:25.923 --> 09:27.515
So, when l heard
what was going on...

09:27.592 --> 09:30.322
l gathered evidence,
but these guys
were right on me.

09:30.395 --> 09:33.956
They threatened my wife
and my kid,
unless l looked the other way.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.863
And they got
the other workers so scared...

09:35.933 --> 09:38.493
especially after
Charlie's accident.
l don't like it.

09:38.569 --> 09:41.367
These are hardworking men
who are just trying to earn
an honest living.

09:41.439 --> 09:43.498
We have to get jobs
inside your plant...

09:43.574 --> 09:45.769
and work undercover
to find out
who these guys are.

09:45.843 --> 09:47.640
l do the hiring
in my department.

09:47.712 --> 09:49.407
l can get a couple
of you guys inside.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.846
l like that.
lt'd be just like James Bond.

09:51.916 --> 09:54.783
Super-sleuthing
and moving through
the shadows.

09:54.852 --> 09:56.945
But it isn't going to be cheap
to pull this off, Hannibal.

09:57.021 --> 09:59.546
That's why l took up
a collection with the guys
from the plant.

09:59.624 --> 10:01.489
Now they're too scared
to talk.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.993
They just want this thing
to stop.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.531
Listen, the workers
are honest men
with families to support.

10:07.598 --> 10:09.031
They want the nightmare
to end.

10:09.100 --> 10:13.264
Now, we're willing to take up
a collection every week
until your debt is paid off.

10:13.805 --> 10:15.966
Resourceful, l gotta admit.

10:16.074 --> 10:17.939
l'll cover the outside.

10:18.009 --> 10:20.341
A guy like me would look
out of place
on an assembly line.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.539
And l don't have anything
in my wardrobe
to go with grease and grime.

10:23.614 --> 10:25.206
That's all right, Face.

10:25.283 --> 10:27.843
Murdock'll help you
press your overalls.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.918
Mr. Garcia,
you've just hired the A-Team.

10:31.989 --> 10:33.217
Okay.

10:54.178 --> 10:55.873
Good morning.
Good morning.

10:55.947 --> 10:59.110
l have some union documents
for you to fill out.

11:00.084 --> 11:01.779
Follow me down over here.

11:01.853 --> 11:03.787
We're going to put you
on the metal presses.

11:03.855 --> 11:07.291
l think
it'll be a lot easier
for you to pick up on.

11:09.660 --> 11:12.891
Everyone seems
to stick by themselves
around here.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.766
Like l said,
the workers are scared.

11:15.833 --> 11:18.028
They don't know who to trust.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.943
B.A., you wanna paint?

11:30.014 --> 11:31.572
No, man.
l'm working on the molding.

11:31.649 --> 11:32.980
l'll let you paint
for a quarter.

11:33.050 --> 11:34.039
Shut up, fool!

11:34.118 --> 11:35.881
lt's real neat, B.A.

11:37.054 --> 11:41.457
You just let your body flow
with the paint can.

11:41.559 --> 11:44.153
Let flow
with the spray can...

11:44.228 --> 11:46.958
spreading a smooth
and even coat...

11:47.031 --> 11:49.056
over the surface
that you're working on.

11:49.133 --> 11:52.296
lf you don't shut up,
l'm gonna smooth this here
over you--

11:54.205 --> 11:55.672
Look at that.

11:55.740 --> 11:59.176
That's something else
you can do with the paint can.

11:59.243 --> 12:01.473
You can play games with it,
just like we're doing now.

12:01.546 --> 12:04.447
[horn honking]
You wanna play a game?
We can play paint, man.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.245
Murdock'll be the paint man.
Murdock is a dead man!

12:07.885 --> 12:09.045
[honking]

12:13.491 --> 12:15.550
Well, well, well,
isn't this nice?

12:15.626 --> 12:18.720
l'm glad to see the two of you
can get along without
getting into any trouble.

12:18.796 --> 12:21.560
Ain't no trouble.
Just gonna wring his neck.
Save me, Face, man.

12:21.632 --> 12:25.124
Look, B.A., could you wait
a day or two before putting
Murdock out of his misery?

12:25.203 --> 12:27.535
We gotta get this warehouse
into shape by tonight.

12:27.605 --> 12:29.937
Speaking of in shape, man,
what you wearing?

12:30.775 --> 12:31.901
This.

12:35.646 --> 12:37.079
You like it?

12:38.316 --> 12:39.874
l found it in the trunk.

12:39.951 --> 12:41.316
Well, l had to look the part.

12:41.385 --> 12:44.081
l didn't want to get picked up
for car theft.

12:44.155 --> 12:47.056
lt sounds like
it's making all kinds
of funny noises.

12:47.124 --> 12:48.386
(B.A.)
Man, l don't understand.

12:48.459 --> 12:50.950
l thought you was supposed
to be getting a sign
for the store.

12:51.028 --> 12:53.326
B.A., this is the sign.

12:53.397 --> 12:55.831
(Face)
''Otto's Auto Parts Store.''

12:56.400 --> 12:58.163
Get it, Otto's Auto?

12:58.936 --> 13:03.373
You guys think it's easy
getting an auto parts sign
during a lunch break?

13:03.474 --> 13:05.772
Actually, l think it was
pretty ingenious of me.

13:05.843 --> 13:08.937
Now, do you think
it'll fit on top of the roof?

13:10.715 --> 13:13.183
Yeah, l think
it'll fit perfectly.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.488
[whistle blowing]

14:48.245 --> 14:49.473
[thudding]

15:17.475 --> 15:20.308
Boy, it really looked
like they wonked
the old Colonel, didn't it?

15:20.378 --> 15:21.436
Yeah.

15:58.215 --> 15:59.910
[tires screeching]

16:14.331 --> 16:15.662
Look out!

16:15.766 --> 16:17.199
[tires screeching]

16:19.336 --> 16:21.361
(B.A.)
You okay, little brother?

16:31.482 --> 16:32.881
We lost them.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.511
Well, he's on his own now.

16:58.342 --> 17:01.243
(announcer)
Dave Moore, please report
to the used car lot.

17:01.312 --> 17:04.338
Dave Moore, please report
to the used car lot.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.146
[children chattering]

17:35.513 --> 17:36.912
[drilling]

17:50.895 --> 17:52.658
[seagulls squawking]

18:09.346 --> 18:12.008
(Hoyt)
We've been watching you
for close to a week now.

18:12.082 --> 18:13.879
You're a lousy thief.

18:15.419 --> 18:20.015
But even if you were good,
we don't allow anyone
to come into our territory.

18:21.859 --> 18:23.258
Who are you?

18:23.661 --> 18:25.822
l'll tell you when you
can ask the questions.

18:25.896 --> 18:28.126
Who do you work for?
Nobody.

18:29.099 --> 18:30.498
[Hoyt sighs]

18:31.001 --> 18:34.095
(Hoyt)
Nobody carts off 1 2 cases
of the same auto part...

18:34.171 --> 18:36.765
unless he's got
a large-scale buyer.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.808
Now, who you selling to?

18:39.443 --> 18:42.207
The guy gives me
50 cents on the dollar.

18:43.480 --> 18:45.675
You've just been
put out of business.

18:45.749 --> 18:48.411
You see,
we own the auto plant.

18:48.485 --> 18:50.350
We don't allow competition.

18:50.621 --> 18:53.954
Anybody that works there
works for us.
You understand?

18:54.024 --> 18:57.926
Now you go back,
you tell your buyer
that he's closed down.

18:58.829 --> 19:01.992
You tell him that you work
for somebody new now.

19:03.033 --> 19:05.593
Anything you steal,
you sell to us.

19:05.669 --> 19:08.536
We want that message
delivered very clear.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.137
He's not gonna like it.

19:11.976 --> 19:13.534
That's too bad.

19:14.144 --> 19:16.635
Maybe you can help us
convince him.

19:16.814 --> 19:18.076
[gasping]

19:28.192 --> 19:31.525
You said
they'd be tough, Hannibal,
but we didn't expect this.

19:31.595 --> 19:33.495
Yeah.
What did the doctor say?

19:33.564 --> 19:35.828
He said no concussion.

19:35.899 --> 19:38.060
Take two aspirin
and go to bed.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.796
Sounds exactly
what happened to me.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.566
The blindfold,
the bright lights
and then the beating.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.541
Yeah, l figured
they might use the same MO.

19:45.609 --> 19:49.443
But instead of
beating up my face,
they pounded on my kidneys.

19:49.513 --> 19:51.845
lt's a good thing
you had the watch, Colonel.

19:51.915 --> 19:53.212
l know they had you
in the van...

19:53.283 --> 19:55.308
but l hope
you was able to pick up
some sounds.

19:55.386 --> 19:57.513
l don't know, B.A.
l was out cold.

19:57.588 --> 20:00.182
(Face)
Well, l gotta admit analyzing
the sounds on that tape...

20:00.257 --> 20:01.724
that's one of your best yet.

20:01.792 --> 20:03.783
(Murdock)
lt's brilliant.
He's absolutely brilliant.

20:03.861 --> 20:05.385
(Hannibal)
Well, we'll see.

20:05.462 --> 20:08.898
When we got there,
l think we wound up
in a warehouse.

20:08.966 --> 20:12.663
Sure, if they
steal auto parts, they'd
need a place to stash 'em.

20:12.736 --> 20:15.466
Well, how long
is it gonna take, B.A.?

20:15.539 --> 20:18.235
Well, as soon
as l get my hands
on these components...

20:18.308 --> 20:20.833
it shouldn't take
more than an hour.

20:22.046 --> 20:26.449
A multi-switch digital
regulator, one oscillator,
10-point DB overlay...

20:27.217 --> 20:31.051
O and G mode generator,
AC current amplifier...

20:31.121 --> 20:35.217
a bypass switch
for sound readout with
an electrical base relay...

20:35.392 --> 20:38.884
on O and G, point 3 OC 18?

20:40.497 --> 20:41.691
Simple.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.147
(B.A.)
l hear a car agency.

21:03.353 --> 21:06.982
A school yard.
Must be Parkman Elementary.

21:08.192 --> 21:09.921
l got a beach here.

21:12.196 --> 21:14.027
l hear some kind
of construction.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.726
(Face)
There's a high rise
going up on Wilshire.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.665
(Hannibal)
No, Face, that'd be over here.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.363
Waves and kids.

21:21.105 --> 21:22.299
Venice.

21:32.382 --> 21:33.781
An airport.

21:38.822 --> 21:42.087
Stretches all the way
and stops here.

21:42.159 --> 21:43.854
lt's an industrial park
near the harbor.

21:43.927 --> 21:46.691
There's a lot of warehouses
in that area.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.629
Okay, mount up.
Face, bring your camera.

21:48.699 --> 21:50.166
We're gonna pay
these guys a visit.

21:50.234 --> 21:52.225
Rudy, you better
take a vacation for a while.

21:52.302 --> 21:54.702
lt's going to get hairy
around here.
Hannibal...

21:54.905 --> 21:57.533
l'd like to stick this out,
if you don't mind.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.568
Okay.

22:17.694 --> 22:19.457
[camera clicking]

22:37.347 --> 22:39.008
(Hannibal)
You got them all?

22:39.449 --> 22:41.041
Yeah, l got 'em.

22:41.118 --> 22:42.346
Okay, you guys ready?

22:42.419 --> 22:44.080
Ready, Hannibal.

22:51.328 --> 22:53.023
[tires screeching]

22:54.198 --> 22:55.688
[gun firing]

23:05.676 --> 23:06.973
[groaning]

23:10.113 --> 23:13.514
All right,
up against the wall!
Nice and easy.

23:14.718 --> 23:16.652
Who are you?
We can make a deal here.

23:16.720 --> 23:18.517
(B.A.)
Tell us who you work for!
Get lost.

23:18.589 --> 23:20.318
(Hannibal)
The man asked you a question.

23:20.390 --> 23:21.516
(Hoyt)
l got nothin' to say.

23:21.592 --> 23:24.356
We've got enough pictures
of you to put you away
for good.

23:24.428 --> 23:26.828
There's no way
that we're gonna tell you
who we work for.

23:26.897 --> 23:27.989
Okay.

23:28.632 --> 23:30.156
Take the truck.

23:53.023 --> 23:55.617
We gotta find out
who those guys are.

24:02.132 --> 24:03.759
(Hannibal)
Keep up with Murdock, B.A.

24:03.834 --> 24:05.927
We'll stash the truck
at the auto store.

24:06.003 --> 24:08.733
Hannibal, we had 'em
back there red-handed
and you just let 'em go.

24:08.805 --> 24:11.467
That's part of the plan,
right?
Right.

24:11.541 --> 24:13.202
They're working
for some big shot.

24:13.277 --> 24:16.178
They'd rather go to jail
than give his name.

24:16.246 --> 24:18.510
He's gotta be
a real heavyweight.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.140
A real bad dude?

24:20.217 --> 24:22.481
Yeah. We'll let them go
and get 'em all together.

24:22.552 --> 24:25.919
Well, let's go, B.A.
We got some pictures
to develop.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.858
(Hoyt)
l want you to tell me
everything you know.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.870
(Matt)
l swear to you
l know nothing.

24:40.938 --> 24:42.200
l do my job...

24:42.272 --> 24:44.570
and l keep my nose clean.
Hey, man, l got a family!

24:44.641 --> 24:45.903
Man, l don't want trouble.

24:45.976 --> 24:47.773
Well, those guys
had to be hired heat.

24:47.844 --> 24:50.244
l'm going to find out
who is doing
all the talking.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.606
You tell the workers l'm gonna
take it out of their hides.
You understand me?

24:53.684 --> 24:55.652
Yeah, man.
What's going on here?

24:55.719 --> 24:57.016
Nothing.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.422
Just teaching this guy
a couple of lessons.

24:59.489 --> 25:02.014
About, uh, how to drop
a transmission.

25:02.092 --> 25:03.081
[chuckles]

25:04.494 --> 25:06.257
Break was over
a half hour ago.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.026
Oh, yes sir, Mr. Foreman.

25:09.099 --> 25:10.532
Don't push it, Rudy.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.067
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

25:12.135 --> 25:14.330
Get back to your department,
Matt.

25:14.938 --> 25:15.927
Hey.

25:16.039 --> 25:17.836
Everything is busted up
around here.

25:17.908 --> 25:19.842
l said get back to work.

25:19.910 --> 25:22.242
Tell the company
they owe me a quarter.

25:23.013 --> 25:24.002
Matt.

25:24.681 --> 25:25.670
Matt.

25:25.916 --> 25:26.905
Rudy...

25:27.150 --> 25:28.879
why don't you just mind
your business?

25:29.052 --> 25:31.077
What goes down in this plant
is my business.

25:31.154 --> 25:33.987
Now you know
what's going down, half
the work force not coming in.

25:34.057 --> 25:35.490
Yeah, maybe.

25:35.559 --> 25:38.153
But you butting in
is just going
to make matters worse.

25:40.597 --> 25:42.462
Look, l know
you want to help, Rudy.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.400
But just leave
matters alone, all right.

25:45.469 --> 25:46.959
lt's better that way.

25:53.076 --> 25:55.544
(Rudy)
Yeah, l know who they are.
That's Hoyt Plummer.

25:56.580 --> 25:57.877
Williams.

25:58.448 --> 25:59.437
McCormick.

26:01.284 --> 26:03.912
All three work
in the engine department.

26:04.221 --> 26:06.246
l just had
a run-in with them.

26:07.057 --> 26:09.082
Look, you know
it's all starting
to make sense.

26:09.159 --> 26:11.593
l just wonder if we're doing
the right thing here.

26:12.229 --> 26:14.959
Rudy, whenever you stand up
against slimeballs...

26:15.032 --> 26:16.727
you're doing the right thing.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.267
Now we know who they are.

26:18.335 --> 26:20.326
All we got to do
is keep our eye on them...

26:20.404 --> 26:21.871
until they make a move.

26:21.938 --> 26:23.803
Well, they pretty much
keep to themselves...

26:23.874 --> 26:26.536
although they do hang out
a lot in the lunch room.

26:27.244 --> 26:28.302
Yeah? The lunch room.

26:28.845 --> 26:30.335
(Face)
You see, l think...

26:30.414 --> 26:33.941
the real problem here
is wiring connections.

26:34.451 --> 26:36.817
Yeah, that'll get you
every time.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.949
Usually,
it's a loose connection...

26:39.022 --> 26:40.990
or it's corrosion or it's....

26:41.058 --> 26:43.993
You know, it'll run perfectly
for a time
and then all of a sudden...

26:44.227 --> 26:45.956
zappo! Nothing.

26:46.029 --> 26:48.896
(Bobby)
Looks like break time
is over guys.

26:59.576 --> 27:02.807
You, too, pal.
Go work at another machine.

27:02.879 --> 27:04.073
Oh, yeah. Sure. Right.

27:04.147 --> 27:06.445
Well, l think it should work
now anyway, you know.

27:06.516 --> 27:09.952
See, the problem was
a loose connection
in the chute mechanism....

27:10.020 --> 27:12.250
Grab your tools and get.

27:12.322 --> 27:15.485
Oh, yeah, right.
l can tell you about this
some other time.

27:21.031 --> 27:22.589
(Hoyt)
Sweep the area.

27:27.571 --> 27:29.038
[beeping]

27:37.781 --> 27:39.043
How we doing?

27:39.983 --> 27:41.143
Clean.

27:44.921 --> 27:48.550
Okay. Well,
we've got one big problem.

27:49.359 --> 27:52.760
The guys who ripped us off
have got to know a lot
about our operation.

27:52.829 --> 27:53.818
Trouble is...

27:53.897 --> 27:55.922
we don't know who they are
or how much they know.

27:55.999 --> 27:57.626
What are we going to tell
Jimmy Durkee?

27:57.701 --> 28:00.898
l mean, man. He ain't
going to take it too well,
us getting ripped off.

28:02.506 --> 28:05.703
l'm telling you.
The guys who ripped us off
aren't auto workers.

28:06.810 --> 28:09.040
lt's got to be
someone inside.

28:09.379 --> 28:11.313
Someone right here
in this plant...

28:11.815 --> 28:14.750
and we're going
to find out who.

28:16.319 --> 28:17.911
l'm calling Durkee.

28:33.503 --> 28:34.527
Darn machine.

28:34.604 --> 28:36.572
Hey, it dropped
the wrong soda.

28:42.412 --> 28:43.401
Hey.

28:44.014 --> 28:45.982
You know,
you didn't fix the machine.

28:46.049 --> 28:47.539
Gave me the wrong soda.

28:47.617 --> 28:48.777
Oh, it did?

28:48.852 --> 28:50.046
Right. l'll get on it.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.281
l'll go find my partner
and get on it right away.

29:17.814 --> 29:20.715
They found no bugs, sir.
Clean as a whistle.

29:20.784 --> 29:22.513
You gave him the wrong soda.

29:22.586 --> 29:23.780
Yes. But it doesn't matter.

29:23.853 --> 29:25.912
Because l got everything
they said right up here.

29:25.989 --> 29:27.513
And l made 50 cents to boot.

29:27.891 --> 29:30.382
l don't know.
Four guys jump out
with submachine guns...

29:30.460 --> 29:33.258
what am l supposed to do?
Ask 'em their names,
where they live?

29:33.330 --> 29:35.890
(Jimmy)
It was your job to keep
everything clean, Hoyt.

29:35.966 --> 29:38.491
You were supposed to see that
everything ran smooth.

29:38.568 --> 29:41.093
lnstead l got no truck
and no supplies to deliver.

29:41.171 --> 29:42.968
That's very bad
for business, Hoyt.

29:43.039 --> 29:44.563
l know, man. l know.

29:44.641 --> 29:47.337
All right, find out who did
this to us. Find them fast...

29:47.410 --> 29:48.877
and get the stuff back.

29:48.945 --> 29:50.207
Now you got all that?

29:50.413 --> 29:52.244
l got it, Jimmy.
Don't worry. l'm on it.

29:52.315 --> 29:54.215
We'll find them.
l swear to you.

29:55.685 --> 29:57.118
What do you say, Hoyt?

29:57.187 --> 30:00.156
Couldn't help but overhear.
You like to talk about it?

30:00.223 --> 30:01.952
Who are you
to ask me anything?

30:02.025 --> 30:05.222
Well, listen. l might know
what happened to that truck
of yours last night.

30:05.295 --> 30:07.058
Where is it? Where?

30:07.530 --> 30:09.862
Hey, man,
you're wrinkling the threads.

30:11.301 --> 30:13.326
l've got some information
for ya.

30:14.204 --> 30:15.694
You ought to
better listen, huh.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.069
All right, talk.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.272
Well, l got a hunch...

30:20.343 --> 30:22.573
my old boss
Crazy Willy Beano...

30:23.013 --> 30:24.708
ripped off your truck
last night.

30:24.781 --> 30:26.339
When l told him that...

30:26.549 --> 30:27.777
l was leaving his outfit...

30:27.851 --> 30:30.081
to go to work for you,
he went nuts.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.385
Said he was gonna
put you out of business.

30:32.455 --> 30:34.582
And Crazy Willy's
crazy enough to try it.

30:34.658 --> 30:36.956
Well, he don't know
who he ripped off, man.

30:37.027 --> 30:39.962
The guy l work for
handles half the action
in this state.

30:40.297 --> 30:41.924
Nobody messes with him.

30:42.198 --> 30:45.725
Sounds like the kind of guy
that Crazy Willy would
eat for breakfast.

30:46.336 --> 30:47.667
Where is this guy?

30:48.238 --> 30:50.900
He's got an auto parts store
over at Fourth and Central.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.566
l'll show ya where it is.

30:53.476 --> 30:56.070
No, you wait here with Lucas.

30:57.013 --> 30:59.072
Me and Bobby Joe'll
pay this guy a visit.

30:59.149 --> 31:00.844
l think l really ought
to come with ya.

31:00.917 --> 31:04.045
ln case we're not back
in an hour, this is
some kind of a setup...

31:04.354 --> 31:06.879
put this guy's head
in a drill press.
Right.

31:07.424 --> 31:08.413
Fine.

31:11.494 --> 31:13.155
Don't mind if l get a soda,
do you?

31:13.229 --> 31:14.560
Why not?

31:23.907 --> 31:24.965
(Hannibal)
Face.

31:25.675 --> 31:27.700
There's been a change
in plans. l'm staying here.

31:27.777 --> 31:29.745
What did you tell them?
What else.

31:29.813 --> 31:31.246
l got a crazy boss.

31:31.314 --> 31:32.440
(Face)
Oh, great.

31:32.515 --> 31:34.847
And you're not
going to be there
to give the performance.

31:34.918 --> 31:36.545
Who we gonna use?

31:36.619 --> 31:38.143
Well, l told him
he was crazy.

31:38.254 --> 31:40.085
l am Crazy Willy...

31:41.658 --> 31:42.647
Beano.

31:43.626 --> 31:46.459
Beano, you know,
rhymes with Dino.

31:46.529 --> 31:48.588
What's the matter,
you don't understand English?

31:48.665 --> 31:49.689
Dino.

31:49.766 --> 31:52.166
[ Everybody
loves somebody-- [[

31:52.902 --> 31:55.769
What's the matter?
You think l'm wearing a piece?

31:57.707 --> 31:58.935
l'm clean.

32:00.276 --> 32:02.369
l'm running a business here.

32:02.479 --> 32:03.878
Not a shooting gallery.

32:03.947 --> 32:06.643
All right, we're going to
make this nice and simple.

32:06.783 --> 32:10.446
We either get our truck back,
or we bury you
underneath this store.

32:14.190 --> 32:16.055
Forgive me for not laughing...

32:16.760 --> 32:19.456
but l always find
the baby's first step...

32:20.497 --> 32:22.556
to be a very serious thing.

32:25.101 --> 32:29.401
Nobody comes in here
and threatens me
under my own roof...

32:30.707 --> 32:33.175
especially when l'm eating
a tuna fish sandwich.

32:33.243 --> 32:35.905
Smith said this guy
was looney tunes.

32:37.213 --> 32:38.771
Looney Tunes, huh?

32:38.948 --> 32:41.610
What other TV program
do you watch regularly?

32:42.352 --> 32:44.411
All right, l don't know
what your game is...

32:44.487 --> 32:46.216
but we want that truck back.

32:48.725 --> 32:52.422
The only thing
that Crazy Willy
ever gives back...

32:53.363 --> 32:54.625
is trouble.

32:57.200 --> 33:00.135
You mess around

33:01.905 --> 33:03.270

33:03.873 --> 33:05.306

with anything?

33:13.349 --> 33:15.146

This is a friend of mine.

33:15.418 --> 33:16.817
We call him Mayhem.

33:17.387 --> 33:19.855
All right. You want a war?
We'll give you a war.

33:22.525 --> 33:23.753
All right.

33:24.060 --> 33:26.085
Red and you're dead.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.562
Take one off the top.

33:32.735 --> 33:34.430
lt's your lucky day.

33:34.637 --> 33:36.969
You don't even get to bleed
on the carpeting.

33:38.575 --> 33:40.270
Now, you tell your friends...

33:42.111 --> 33:43.703
l sell auto parts.

33:44.147 --> 33:45.580
lf they want some...

33:45.915 --> 33:47.780
they should come down here
and see me.

33:49.085 --> 33:50.518
l'll provide the lunch.

33:53.356 --> 33:56.553
Nobody sticks his hand
into my candy jar
and gets away with it.

33:56.626 --> 33:58.253
You're supposed
to see to that.

33:58.328 --> 34:01.661
Jimmy--
l don't need punks around me
who can't handle things.

34:01.731 --> 34:05.064
Jimmy, l'm telling you,
that Crazy Willy is bananas.

34:05.134 --> 34:06.658
He's liable
to do anything.
No.

34:06.736 --> 34:09.466
The only thing
he is going to do is bleed.
You understand?

34:09.539 --> 34:11.938
Now, get these guys together
and arm them.

34:12.007 --> 34:14.476
We're going to move in
on that auto store today.

34:16.646 --> 34:18.476
And one more thing.

34:19.282 --> 34:21.716
Grab that foreman
who started all this trouble.

34:21.784 --> 34:23.717
We're going to put him
in the ground.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.552
Mommy and l went shopping.
l got a doll.

34:29.626 --> 34:31.184
No kidding.

34:33.496 --> 34:35.293
(Rudy)
Let's see
what kind of a doll--

34:35.364 --> 34:36.889
Get 'em out of here.

34:38.268 --> 34:39.565
(Bobby)
Come on. Let's go.

34:39.636 --> 34:40.864
(Lucas)
Give me the kid.

34:41.471 --> 34:42.460

lt looks good.

34:54.384 --> 34:56.011
l think they're all in there.

35:02.392 --> 35:05.793
Murdock, where were you?
You were supposed
to relieve me back there.

35:05.862 --> 35:07.659
Yeah, but l lost my--
Yes.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.254
l'll go get my gun.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.367
Police officer, freeze.

35:12.435 --> 35:14.801

Up against the wall.

Now look...

35:38.161 --> 35:40.629
you probably
won't believe this,
but what you see is...

35:40.697 --> 35:42.858
really not what you see.
Yeah.

35:43.232 --> 35:44.529
Yeah, right.

35:45.134 --> 35:47.500
All right, let's go.
Hands up against the wall.

35:48.438 --> 35:51.601
We've had you
under surveillance since you
started working at the plant.

35:51.674 --> 35:53.938
l had no idea you had
this big of an operation.

35:54.177 --> 35:56.668
Well now,
if you'd see Rudy Garcia.

35:56.746 --> 35:59.738
l mean,
he's the foreman at the plant.
He can explain a lot of this.

35:59.816 --> 36:01.477
Rudy Garcia, huh?

36:01.985 --> 36:04.078
What are you guys
trying to pull?

36:04.153 --> 36:08.146
We just got word
that Rudy Garcia and his wife
and kid were kidnapped.

36:08.224 --> 36:11.022
And you guys
are the prime suspects.

36:11.094 --> 36:12.959
Look, man,
we didn't kidnap nobody.

36:15.064 --> 36:16.053
Wait a minute.

36:18.201 --> 36:19.862
l've seen you three before.

36:20.203 --> 36:22.103
l've seen
your pictures before.

36:23.039 --> 36:24.529
l don't believe it.

36:25.642 --> 36:27.269
You guys are the A-Team.

36:28.845 --> 36:30.608
l've caught the A-Team.

36:30.713 --> 36:33.375
My lord! The A-Team?

36:33.449 --> 36:37.715
l've heard of them. They're
them fugitives that are wanted
all across the country.

36:37.787 --> 36:40.585
You mean,
l've been standing here
working side by side...

36:40.657 --> 36:42.591
with members of the A-Team?

36:42.659 --> 36:45.150
There's a reward out
for all the guys.

36:45.228 --> 36:48.254
l will never believe it.
Here l am just a dumb clerk.

36:48.331 --> 36:50.595
l wouldn't have believed it.
Never in a million years.

36:50.667 --> 36:52.532
Of course l always
had my suspicions.

36:52.602 --> 36:53.762
Never did trust this one.

36:53.836 --> 36:56.134
lt's them beady eyes.
Hold on, be careful.

36:56.439 --> 36:58.532
l know their reputation.
They're deadly.

36:59.208 --> 37:00.800
We're going to
have to tie them up.

37:01.744 --> 37:02.768
Okay.

l can't walk at all
because of you.

37:45.755 --> 37:48.155
Now you know
it was just an accident.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.486
Now let me see this here.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.652
Let go of my foot.
You're going to
make it worse.

37:51.728 --> 37:54.993
Now listen, l can help you.
But you have to listen to me.
Do you understand?

37:55.064 --> 37:58.761
Pain is in the head.
So if you think it hurts,
it's going to hurt.

37:58.835 --> 38:00.268
Now, you got to think
nice things.

38:00.336 --> 38:02.770
Just think happy thoughts.
Go ahead.
Okay.

38:02.839 --> 38:04.500
l'm thinking
you got hit by a bus.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.599
Well then,
you ought to be
feeling better already.

38:06.676 --> 38:08.439
Now, tell me
when it hurts, all right?

38:08.511 --> 38:11.173
Hey, Hannibal!
Tell this fool
to leave me alone!

38:11.247 --> 38:13.374
Well, that guy's
going to have a headache
when he wakes up.

38:13.449 --> 38:15.610
But right now,
he's sleeping like a baby.

38:15.685 --> 38:17.084
What are we
going to do, Hannibal?

38:17.153 --> 38:18.484
They got Rudy and his family.

38:18.554 --> 38:20.681
We will have to mount
an attack on them right away.

38:20.757 --> 38:21.883
Attack.

38:21.958 --> 38:24.483
What kind of attack?
A classic.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.661
The reverse frontal assault.

38:27.830 --> 38:28.990
That's a great one.

38:29.499 --> 38:32.024
Reverse frontal.
Yeah. Now listen.

38:32.168 --> 38:33.260
Here's the plan.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.844
we really outdid
ourselves this time.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.005
Well, Hannibal, we got
a full supply of ammo...

41:33.082 --> 41:34.913

and ready.
