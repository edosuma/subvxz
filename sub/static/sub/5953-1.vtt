19:01.806 --> 19:05.503
You should put some molasses in that

19:05.577 --> 19:07.511
- Go see daddy.
- Look at you.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.070

Hey, relax.
Thomas likes it, don't you?

No, you don't. No.
I knew you didn't.

the limit is, okay?

19:42.781 --> 19:44.908
I just think we oughta
test it once in a while.

19:44.983 --> 19:48.077
I mean they gotta let us get away
from this tyke sometime.

19:48.153 --> 19:52.283

with a good cookie boy like Thomas.

Hasn't happened to me.
I'm not over there runnin' into walls.

- [Thomas] Hug-a-bug.
- What is that? "Hug-a-bug?"

20:23.421 --> 20:26.948

Um, that's a very good
question, Thomas.

20:46.177 --> 20:49.544

the battle of Gettysburg...

21:13.404 --> 21:18.034

31:10.167 --> 31:12.101
I don't think
they're gonna bother you."

31:12.169 --> 31:15.661
I said, "You're telling me what's
gonna bother me, what I'm allergic to."

31:15.739 --> 31:18.902
- So I ended up getting a dozen pairs...
- Pairs, 25% nylon.

31:18.976 --> 31:23.106
- Have I told you this before?
- When Thomas was about 15.

31:24.682 --> 31:26.616
[Milo]
Where are we, anyway?

31:26.684 --> 31:30.711
Stellar Aviation. Another bankruptcy.
Don't you ever pay attention?

31:30.788 --> 31:33.586
[Penny] I wonder why they
always send Thomas to do this.

31:33.657 --> 31:37.787
- 'Cause it doesn't seem to bother him.
- It does.

31:37.861 --> 31:39.795
- [Tools Drilling]
- Ohh.

31:39.863 --> 31:43.856
- Stop it. You're never gonna catch one.
- [Sighs]

31:45.669 --> 31:49.298
- Hey, look, I'm a man.
- You're a dead man.

31:49.373 --> 31:53.241
You bug my ass. You've been
buggin' my ass since the early '70s.

31:53.310 --> 31:56.245
- This guy chose it.
- [Thomas] Patterson, how you doin'?

31:56.313 --> 31:59.407
Use the same damn parts
if you got to, but get going.

31:59.483 --> 32:02.145
- Dreyfuss!
- Patterson, where you been?

32:02.219 --> 32:04.483
- What are you trying to do, Mr. Reilly?
- I'm trying to contact you.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.785
I phoned, I faxed, I messengered,
I paged. You're very mysterious.

32:06.857 --> 32:09.348
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So get to the point, huh?

32:09.426 --> 32:12.020
[Sighing] You're aware of
the bankruptcy hearing on Monday?

32:12.096 --> 32:14.257
- Yes, of course I'm aware of it.
- Okay. Well,

32:14.331 --> 32:17.823
I just dropped by to tell you my bank...
actually, the rest of your creditors...

32:17.901 --> 32:20.199
have decided to push
for liquidation.

32:20.270 --> 32:23.137
- What?
- [Equipment Drilling Continues]

32:23.207 --> 32:26.404
Look, I'm not bankrupt.
I'm just behind a little.

32:26.477 --> 32:31.141
A little behind,
6.4 million, $6,429,089.

32:31.215 --> 32:35.914
We're gonna reorganize under chapter 11,
so it's gonna take some time.

32:35.986 --> 32:40.480
So you and the others are just
gonna have to wait for your money.

32:40.557 --> 32:42.821
See, we have waited,

32:42.893 --> 32:47.455
and we've watched you drain
more money out of this company.

32:47.531 --> 32:50.295
Think you can
take me on, Reilly?

32:50.367 --> 32:54.326
If you think you have
a case for reorganization,

32:54.405 --> 32:56.498
convince the judge.

32:58.709 --> 33:02.372
[Milo] How many more years of this?
Huh? When's he gonna retire?

33:04.114 --> 33:07.675
It's amazing these things
can get off the ground.

33:13.857 --> 33:17.588
Look, Tim, I paid you 185 bucks
to detail my car, and you know what l...

33:17.661 --> 33:20.789
No. I'm seeing streaks, streaks
on the windshield, streaks on the dash,

33:20.864 --> 33:23.765
so I'm gonna bring it back in
Saturday, waste my weekend...

33:23.834 --> 33:26.200
allowing you to explore
your incompetence, all right?

33:26.270 --> 33:28.602
Oh, by the way...
[Dial Tone]

33:28.672 --> 33:32.904
- I hate that phone. He's always on it.
- Saves him time.

33:32.976 --> 33:35.968
Doesn't save him enough time to call
his mother and his father, does it?

33:36.046 --> 33:38.412
[Telephone Rings, Beeps]

33:38.482 --> 33:40.575
- Yeah?
- Hi, it's Noelle.

33:40.651 --> 33:43.950
- What do ya got for me?
- A staff meeting this afternoon,
and Anne called.

33:44.021 --> 33:46.615
- She cancelled your lunch at Post Trio.
- She did? Why?

33:46.690 --> 33:49.158
She found this great new place,
nobody knows about it.

33:49.226 --> 33:51.558
You should just meet her there.
Here's the address.

33:51.695 --> 33:56.155
[Penny] Oh, I know this place.
I used to come here when I was a kid.

33:56.233 --> 33:59.566
- Isn't it beautiful?
- But it isn't a restaurant, is it?

33:59.636 --> 34:02.264
[Milo] Nah, it's full of plants
and flowers and stuff.

34:02.339 --> 34:06.241
You know what? I broke into this joint.
Mid-50s, Valentine's Day.

34:06.310 --> 34:08.244
My girlfriend needed flowers.

34:08.312 --> 34:11.543
[Harrison] At least it's not crowded.
I hate it when people walk through me.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.879
- Wow!
- [Milo] It depends on who it is.

34:13.951 --> 34:16.545
[Harrison] That's another place
where we're different, Milo.

34:16.620 --> 34:20.283
I always considered it
an invasion of my personal space.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.353
[Thomas]
Sorry I'm late, honey.

34:27.998 --> 34:31.434
- God, how did you get them
to let you use this place?
- They owe me.

34:31.502 --> 34:35.130
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I did the P.R.
For their fund-raiser last year.

34:35.205 --> 34:37.469
Mmm.

34:43.746 --> 34:46.511
Stop it with your
"What's she getting me into?" look.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.279
Oh, come on, Anne. You know,
you're... you're doing something here.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.446
Yeah, lunch.

34:53.123 --> 34:56.058
Well, it looks good.

34:56.126 --> 34:59.289
[Clears Throat, Sighs]

34:59.363 --> 35:03.959
- Ahhh, Barbados.
- Right. Very good.

35:04.034 --> 35:07.162
Yeah, it was the closest
I could come on my lunch break.

35:07.237 --> 35:10.536
[Sighs]
So... relax, eat.

35:11.909 --> 35:14.503
I'm just trying to get us
out of our routine.

35:17.314 --> 35:19.748
- Barbados?
- Where they first met.

35:19.817 --> 35:21.808
Don't you remember anything?

35:24.054 --> 35:28.957
I like this girl. Much better
than little Miss "Look At My Butt.

35:29.026 --> 35:31.756
- Everybody, Thomas, look at my butt."
- [Men Laughing]

35:31.829 --> 35:35.595
What about the other one with the legs?
I'm telling you...

35:35.666 --> 35:38.066
this is the one.

35:38.135 --> 35:41.798
You don't think she's getting
fed up with him already, do you?

35:41.872 --> 35:45.467
Just because we do the same thing over
and over again doesn't, you know...

35:45.542 --> 35:47.567
You call that routine?

35:47.644 --> 35:52.377
Well, yeah, sure, anybody would.
I mean, so would... my parents.

35:52.449 --> 35:54.383
- Speaking of my parents,
- Uh-huh?

35:54.451 --> 35:57.852
They're gonna be in town tomorrow night,
and we'd love you to stop by.

35:57.921 --> 36:02.449
- It's no big deal. If you're around.
- Uh-huh.

36:02.526 --> 36:05.290
Bingo. Thirty seconds,
he's out of here.

36:05.362 --> 36:08.388
No! It's high time
he should meet her parents.

36:08.465 --> 36:10.865
Oh, God.
The parent moment, right?

36:10.934 --> 36:14.836
Come on, Thomas. She's not gonna
wait around forever. Don't blow it.

36:14.905 --> 36:18.397
- Marry her, don't marry her.
- Phone me when it's over.

36:18.475 --> 36:20.841
Okay, the parent moment.

36:23.380 --> 36:27.111
I don't have any problem
with meeting your parents.

36:27.184 --> 36:29.709
- At some point.
- "At some point"?

36:29.786 --> 36:32.277
God, you know,
listen to you.

36:32.356 --> 36:36.383
Any time things get remotely
serious, you start...

36:36.460 --> 36:38.553
I don't know,
wiggling around.

36:40.697 --> 36:42.631
Hmm?

36:42.699 --> 36:45.600
I thought you liked it
when I wiggled around.

36:45.669 --> 36:48.263
God, where did I go wrong?

36:48.338 --> 36:51.705
Guy likes to play the field,
you know. Takes after me.

36:51.775 --> 36:54.209
A baboon in heat
takes after you.

36:54.278 --> 36:56.906
[Laughing]
Oh, Julia, you're killin' me.

36:56.980 --> 36:59.716
[Laughs]

36:59.849 --> 37:03.945
You're killin' me. Oh, yeah,
I'm already dead. I forgot.

37:04.020 --> 37:05.954
Huh.

37:10.493 --> 37:13.121
[Clears Throat]
You guys. Oh.

37:31.481 --> 37:35.941
It... is... time, whoo.

37:36.018 --> 37:39.078
"It's time, whoo"?

37:39.155 --> 37:42.090
All right, all right, all right.
I'm a little late. L...

37:42.158 --> 37:45.150
I should have picked you up
about 15 or 20 years ago,

37:45.228 --> 37:48.459
but, you know, up there,
time's a little relative.

37:54.470 --> 37:56.995
Let's go, dead people.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.444
Time to, you know,
t-t-to go.

38:04.514 --> 38:07.574
[Bus Driver]
I'm taking you onwards.

38:07.650 --> 38:10.141
I know you.

38:10.219 --> 38:12.414
You're the bus driver.

38:12.488 --> 38:15.582
Very good. Now come on.

38:15.658 --> 38:18.149
You're the idiot
that got us all killed.

38:18.227 --> 38:21.685
Yeah.
You lousy bastard.

38:21.764 --> 38:26.428
Because of you,
I've spent the last 30 years...

38:26.502 --> 38:29.437
coolin' my heels
with Mr. Excitement here.

38:29.505 --> 38:32.906
I, I can't get a decent meal,
I can't get a smoke...

38:32.975 --> 38:36.638
and especially,
I can't get laid.

38:36.712 --> 38:39.237
You've turned me
into a goddamn monk!

38:39.315 --> 38:42.113
Hey, back off!
I died in that crash too.

38:42.185 --> 38:44.619
We are so sorry.

38:44.687 --> 38:47.281
Aren't you even gonna
apologize for what you did?

38:47.356 --> 38:51.656
Well, I-I'm doin' penance. I'm drivin'
this bus around for the next 500 years.

38:51.727 --> 38:53.752
Believe me, I'm sorry.

38:53.830 --> 38:58.062
- It's not like they gave me
the opportunities that you got.
- Opportunities?

38:58.134 --> 39:02.901
- For what?
- We know we're not dead.
We know we're not alive.

39:02.972 --> 39:07.170
We know we're not there.
For that matter, we're not here.

39:07.243 --> 39:09.973
We're... what?

39:10.046 --> 39:12.810
- What? What, what?
- What?

39:12.882 --> 39:15.817
What, what is... What is this?
What am I, in the Twilight Zone here?

39:15.885 --> 39:20.322
I'm talking about the opportunity
to resolve your lives.

39:22.692 --> 39:27.720
You know, you get to do the one thing
you would've done before you died...

39:27.797 --> 39:31.358
except you didn't get to do it
on account of some guy...

39:31.434 --> 39:35.268
unintentionally cut your lives
a little... short.

39:35.338 --> 39:40.139
We haven't done anything.
We haven't resolved anything!

39:40.209 --> 39:42.507
You're joking.

39:44.380 --> 39:46.541
I mean, you were told
about this?

39:46.616 --> 39:51.485
The angel, he came down, he explained
it to you? That, that you would...

39:54.824 --> 39:58.487
Okay, hold it.
A-all right, hold it.

39:58.561 --> 40:01.553
All right, back off, back off.
All right, all right! Okay.

40:02.632 --> 40:06.033
[Whispering]

40:06.102 --> 40:09.299
[Stammering] Y-You've been hangin'
around in Limboville there...

40:09.372 --> 40:12.341
since the '50s
just wonderin' what gives?

40:13.843 --> 40:16.641
[Sighs]

40:16.712 --> 40:18.839
Well, you see, what you're
supposed to have done...

40:18.915 --> 40:22.373
is to take care of the one thing that
would have made your lives complete.

40:22.451 --> 40:25.284
You know, I mean I'm not talkin'
about makin' a million dollars,

40:25.354 --> 40:28.551
- or shackin' up with some
pinup girl or something.
- Shackin' up with some pinup...

40:28.624 --> 40:30.558
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

40:30.626 --> 40:32.890
Well, how in the world are we
supposed to do that? We're spirits.

40:32.962 --> 40:34.987
We can't make a phone call.
We can't...

40:35.064 --> 40:38.124
Punch some bus driver
in the chops.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.498
Your corporeal being.

40:42.271 --> 40:45.069
You're supposed to use him
as a vehicle.

40:45.141 --> 40:48.008
And if he won't do it, you enter
his body and you make him do it.

40:48.077 --> 40:51.410
- Enter his body?
- We can take him over?

40:51.480 --> 40:54.643
Well, that would've
been helpful to know.

40:54.717 --> 40:57.845
I knew there was a reason
for all of this.

40:57.920 --> 41:02.789
Yeah, yeah, sure. It's all part
of the grand scheme of things.

41:02.858 --> 41:07.488
Which is worth diddly if someone
doesn't get his halo down here
and tell you what's goin' on.

41:07.563 --> 41:11.329
Oh, thank God. I thought we were
gonna be stuck here forever!

41:11.400 --> 41:13.334
Oh, this is great.

41:13.402 --> 41:15.666
My kids!
I can find out about my kids!

41:15.738 --> 41:18.263
No. No, no. No, no, no.
Wait a second now.

41:18.341 --> 41:20.901
It's too late now. I mean,
I got the bus. It's right here.

41:20.977 --> 41:23.070
What?
You can't take us now.

41:23.145 --> 41:26.376
- Now that we know?
- I gotta take you now. It's time.

41:26.449 --> 41:29.680
And there are new babies on the way,
and you guys are my responsibility.

41:29.752 --> 41:33.279
It's your fault we're here!
I mean, don't you have a conscience?

41:34.724 --> 41:36.749
Everybody gets cancellations.

41:36.826 --> 41:39.351
- Not everybody.
- Oh, come on, please!

41:39.428 --> 41:41.055
Think of your guilt.

41:41.130 --> 41:43.792
Just a little while longer.
You're in charge!

41:43.866 --> 41:45.891
- Look at your schedule.
- Think about your guilt.

41:45.968 --> 41:48.300
All right.
Maybe I can hold off...

41:48.371 --> 41:51.204
until each one of you
is actually needed.

41:51.273 --> 41:53.434
Would you? You would.

41:53.509 --> 41:58.037
I would, but it's not gonna be long,
I'm warning you.

41:58.114 --> 42:02.778
[Groaning] I can't believe
I'm even doing this. It's crazy.

42:02.852 --> 42:05.116
You know, I'm stickin'
my neck out here,

42:05.187 --> 42:08.384
and when I come back for ya,
you better be ready.

42:08.457 --> 42:12.416
- I got first dibs on him.
- [Julia] Oh, no, you don't!

42:14.363 --> 42:16.695
- Hey, Thomas! Hey, man!
- Thomas!

42:16.766 --> 42:20.497
Remember me? It's Milo.
Long time, no see, huh?

42:20.569 --> 42:23.037
...the greatest times of my life.
- Long time, still no see.

42:23.105 --> 42:26.506
[Arguing] You're not
doing it right. Let me try!

42:26.575 --> 42:31.012
- [Arguing Continues]
- When we met, you had this... spark.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.014
- Sure.
- What is she talking about?

42:33.082 --> 42:35.277
- I'm just trying to bring that back.
- Thomas, can you hear us?

42:35.351 --> 42:38.081
- I'll meet your parents tomorrow night.
- We're screwed.

42:38.154 --> 42:40.918
- The guy's brain dead.
- Are you concentrating like we used to?

42:40.990 --> 42:43.481
- [Arguing Continues]
- Yes, I'm concentrating!

42:43.559 --> 42:48.496
- How are we gonna get through to him?
- We don't just scream at him.

42:48.564 --> 42:51.465
Thomas!
Hey, wake up!

42:51.534 --> 42:53.468
- Milo, shhh.
- [Horn Honks]

42:53.536 --> 42:56.130
- Stop it. Sit down!
- You can't just yell at him.

42:56.205 --> 42:58.833
Come on, we have to concentrate
together like we used to.

42:58.908 --> 43:01.775
It's a lot easier
to disappear than to appear.

43:01.844 --> 43:03.937
Sing "Walk Like A Man."

43:04.013 --> 43:06.914
- "Walk Like A Man"?
- Good idea.

43:06.982 --> 43:11.419
- Concentrate.
- Okay. Okay, okay, concentrate.

43:11.487 --> 43:15.924
Walk like a man
Talk like a man

43:15.991 --> 43:20.519
Walk like a man
my son

43:20.596 --> 43:24.555
No woman's worth
crawling on the earth

43:24.633 --> 43:27.227
- So walk like a...
- This isn't working.

43:27.303 --> 43:32.172
Oooh

43:32.241 --> 43:36.905
[Yelling Together]
Thomas! Thomas!

43:37.980 --> 43:42.349
Thomas, it's me.
It's Milo.

43:42.418 --> 43:44.852
It's not, not the radio.
It's me! [Growls]

43:44.920 --> 43:47.115
[Grunting]

43:51.393 --> 43:53.327
Ohhh!

43:53.395 --> 43:56.262
- Contact.
- Hope he doesn't take this badly.

43:56.332 --> 43:59.324

[Tires Screeching]

44:02.605 --> 44:04.869
[Indistinct Shouting]

44:04.974 --> 44:09.206
- You yelled at him in a moving car!
- I did not! I was just a bit loud.

44:09.278 --> 44:12.270
You did. You always
yell everything!

44:12.348 --> 44:15.283
It wasn't even my idea, okay?
It was Penny's. She was the one goin'...

44:15.351 --> 44:17.653
As if... Don't try
to blame me, boy.

44:17.786 --> 44:21.153
- How long's he gonna be out?
- Do I look like an anesthesiologist?

44:21.223 --> 44:24.215
- We've lost a whole night already!
- Nice.

44:25.527 --> 44:28.963
[Groaning]

44:32.701 --> 44:36.137
My car. Uhh,
what happened to my car?

44:36.204 --> 44:39.765
- Thomas?
- Ah, he may be a tad upset.

44:40.842 --> 44:43.310
Thomas?
Sweetie pie,

44:43.378 --> 44:45.312
can you hear us?

44:47.883 --> 44:51.250
We're so sorry, Thomas.
Don't worry, you're gonna be okay.

44:51.319 --> 44:54.345
- What have they got me on?
- How are ya?

44:56.558 --> 44:59.857
You just cracked a couple of ribs,
but you're gonna be okay.

45:06.201 --> 45:09.170
- Oh, my God!
- Thomas, it's been a very long time.

45:09.237 --> 45:12.798
We hope you haven't forgotten us.
We really need your help.

45:12.874 --> 45:15.775
[Gasping]

45:22.184 --> 45:25.176
- God, they're back.
- He remembers us!

45:25.253 --> 45:27.721
- [Shouting]
- He remembers us!

45:27.789 --> 45:30.155
The hallucinations are back.

45:30.225 --> 45:33.023
I never thought of us
as hallucinations.

45:33.095 --> 45:35.495
- Me, neither. Where's he going?
- Wait!

45:35.564 --> 45:37.498
- Thomas?
- Where are you going?

45:37.566 --> 45:40.330
- Bathroom down here?
- We finally figured out
what we're supposed to do.

45:40.402 --> 45:42.563
You're supposed to stay
deep, deep in my subconscious.

45:42.637 --> 45:44.571
Don't run away from us!

45:44.639 --> 45:46.698
- [Arguing]
- Don't jabber at him.

45:46.775 --> 45:50.336
[Arguing Continues]

45:50.412 --> 45:52.346
- [Elevator Bell Rings]
- [Indistinct Chattering]

45:52.414 --> 45:55.349
- He's completely ignoring us!
- Pretending he don't know us.

45:55.417 --> 45:58.318
- [Muttering]
- Oh, straitjacket city!
Thomas, you're not crazy!

45:58.386 --> 46:00.320
- We're real, in our way.
- Hi, guys.

46:00.388 --> 46:03.551
He's a lucky one.
He gets visitors.

46:03.625 --> 46:06.025
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.
- I never get visitors.

46:17.305 --> 46:19.239
[P.A.]
Dr. Singer, please call the operator.

[Sirens Wailing]

46:28.183 --> 46:30.378
Hi.

46:30.452 --> 46:33.387
No, not today.
I'm off medication.

46:40.462 --> 46:43.397
[Sighing, Whispering]
This is gonna sound crazy.

46:43.465 --> 46:45.160
Hmmm?

46:45.233 --> 46:48.361
- Do you see any other people with me?
- No.

46:48.436 --> 46:53.373
- [Sighing]
- Nobody... besides those four.

46:58.046 --> 47:00.037
Do you really see them?

47:00.115 --> 47:02.049
Yes.

47:02.117 --> 47:04.745
What do they look like?

47:06.288 --> 47:10.122
There's a gentleman in a brown hat,
a nice-looking black lady,

47:10.192 --> 47:12.183
a blonde lady
with a pink dooley...

47:12.260 --> 47:14.990
and a young buck
in a leather jacket.

47:15.063 --> 47:18.260
I'm available.

47:18.333 --> 47:21.302
Oh, and the naked guy
with the nose ring.

47:24.206 --> 47:27.937
- Hmmm? No, there's no naked guy...
- I know that!

47:28.009 --> 47:30.204
You double-check me;
I double-check you.

47:30.278 --> 47:33.372
[Laughing]

47:33.448 --> 47:37.976
You're lucky. Well,
the ones I see aren't real.

47:38.053 --> 47:42.319
The ones I see come in the daytime,
and sometimes they stay around.

47:42.390 --> 47:46.793
Like other planets. The stuff they send!
I mean, people from other places.

47:46.862 --> 47:50.764
- Things from other places.
- You're real.

47:50.832 --> 47:52.925
We've always thought so.

47:53.001 --> 47:54.935
Yeah. I mean,
we can't do much.

47:55.003 --> 47:58.097
- We can't do much.
- No.

48:00.175 --> 48:03.872
[Sighing] See, I thought I had
these serious emotional problems.

48:03.945 --> 48:07.073
- So I convinced myself I'd made you up.
- No, no.

48:07.148 --> 48:09.912
We've been here right beside you
all the time, Thomas.

48:09.985 --> 48:13.819
We were supposed to have you help finish
things for us, things we needed to do.

48:17.259 --> 48:19.193
This is so amazing.

48:19.261 --> 48:22.162
- [Laughing]
- Isn't it wonderful, Thomas?

48:22.230 --> 48:25.927
The way the pieces all fit,
you and us... I mean...

48:31.907 --> 48:34.899
What on earth makes you think I
would do anything to help you?

48:34.976 --> 48:37.570
Thomas Kenneth Reilly,
you get back here!

48:37.646 --> 48:41.047
I told ya, I told ya!
Don't leave him, he's gonna be mad!

48:41.116 --> 48:43.880
Whoa! Help me. Oh!

48:43.952 --> 48:47.752
[Milo] I'm real sorry. Really.
You have insurance, right?

48:47.822 --> 48:51.883
- [Thomas] You may not ride in the car.
- [Penny] You drive too fast anyway.

48:51.960 --> 48:54.485
Look, I said I was sorry,
and I have a name, you know.

48:54.562 --> 48:58.157
I am not going to run all over
the place trying to fix things
you should have fixed years ago.

48:58.233 --> 49:02.192
- Find some other kid
and screw up his life.
- Sorry, we're stuck to you.

49:02.270 --> 49:06.104
Where do you get off being so pissed?
We had great times together.

49:06.174 --> 49:08.802
That's true. You did things with us
no other kid ever got to do.

49:08.877 --> 49:10.970
Yeah, right. And then
you left me all alone!

49:11.046 --> 49:13.014
- [Julia] No, we didn't leave you.
- Oh, yeah, well...

49:13.081 --> 49:15.641
you disappeared
when I was seven years old.

49:15.717 --> 49:19.517
- We felt we had to.
- God, I've had no privacy.
You've been with me on my dates.

49:19.587 --> 49:21.521
- Well, we didn't look.
- Yes, we did.

49:21.589 --> 49:24.990
I was in therapy for years trying to
figure out what the hell happened to me.

49:25.060 --> 49:28.359
- We know. We were there.
- I got more out of it that you did.

49:28.430 --> 49:31.160
- You got something out of his therapy?
- That whole "self-esteem" thing.

49:31.232 --> 49:34.133
- I really got in touch...
- Could you not speak for an hour?

49:34.202 --> 49:37.262
- I have a life to lead here.
- Huh, is that what you call it?

49:37.339 --> 49:40.740
Do me a favor,
fade out again.

49:43.745 --> 49:45.679
He's not that
happy to see us.

49:45.814 --> 49:51.309
Let's table that till next week and give
Jim a chance to analyze the prospectus.

49:51.386 --> 49:53.320
Now, Thomas. Thomas!

49:53.388 --> 49:56.118
We're gonna be with you forever
unless you help us!

49:56.191 --> 49:58.455
- He's speaking to you!
- Yeah?

49:58.526 --> 50:02.326
Where are we with Stellar Aviation?
Are we still going for liquidation?

50:02.397 --> 50:05.457
Oh, yeah, well, if we want
to get our money back, yes.

50:05.533 --> 50:09.025
I was actually just going over
the figures that I gave to the judge...

50:09.104 --> 50:11.038
[Papers Ruffling]

50:13.808 --> 50:15.867
The last quarter alone,
Stellar lost $3 million.

50:15.944 --> 50:17.878
These clowns are going down fast.

50:17.946 --> 50:21.143
I can't believe
he won't help us.

50:21.216 --> 50:25.380
You know, the bus driver said
we could just take over his body.

50:25.453 --> 50:28.320
Without his permission?

50:28.390 --> 50:30.984
That's fairly aggressive.
Can we do that?

50:31.059 --> 50:32.993
Let's find out.

50:33.061 --> 50:35.154
The judge is with us on this.
He's a reasonable man.

50:35.230 --> 50:38.063
- Okay, here goes.
- It's the same guy we used
on the MacKenzie liquidation.

50:38.133 --> 50:41.830
He realizes that
the longer we delay...

50:41.903 --> 50:45.100
the worse it is for us...

50:45.173 --> 50:50.611
[Voice Fluctuating]
And... our... creditors.

50:52.313 --> 50:54.804
Ohhh!

50:54.883 --> 50:56.851
But enough about them.

51:01.823 --> 51:05.691
Mmm. Oh, God,
it feels so good.

51:07.529 --> 51:11.829
You know, Mitchell, for an older man,
you really are quite attractive.

51:11.900 --> 51:13.834
[Mumbling]

51:13.902 --> 51:16.632
- [Clears Throat] Thomas!
- I'm sorry.

51:16.704 --> 51:21.164
You know, 11 men
and only one woman?

51:22.944 --> 51:26.710
I think we can do
a little better than that.

51:26.781 --> 51:30.376
- Don't you, Jim?
- Jesus, Thomas, what is this?

51:30.452 --> 51:32.921
[Laughing]

51:35.223 --> 51:37.157
- It works!
- It's nothing.

51:37.225 --> 51:39.785
- We're still going to the game Saturday.
- It feels really weird.

51:39.861 --> 51:42.887
Look, you, this is my livelihood.
You can't do this.

51:42.964 --> 51:45.626
Oh, Thomas, you're so
cute when you get mad.

51:45.700 --> 51:47.895
- Look, this is my livelihood!
- Thomas!

51:47.969 --> 51:50.870
What is going on?

51:52.740 --> 51:56.005
I'm just... I'm sorry.
Just... excuse me.

51:58.880 --> 52:03.374
Look, this is all very illuminating,
all this business mumbo jumbo,

52:03.451 --> 52:05.612
but basically,
who gives a shit...

52:05.687 --> 52:08.918
when there's a beautiful
dish like you in the room?

52:08.990 --> 52:11.857
- [Gasps]
- [Grunts]

52:11.926 --> 52:15.157
You know how long it's been
since I've had sex?

52:15.229 --> 52:18.062
- I'm quite a master.
I'll give you a preview.
- [Screams]

52:18.132 --> 52:20.862
[Grunting, Groaning]

52:22.103 --> 52:24.594
[Laughing]

52:24.672 --> 52:27.835
[Yelling]

52:32.747 --> 52:36.410
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be back in a few.

52:36.484 --> 52:38.782
Ohhh!

52:38.853 --> 52:41.822
Get out of my body!

52:41.889 --> 52:45.848
It's just the beginning, pal.

52:45.927 --> 52:48.259
[Grunts, Groans]

52:48.329 --> 52:51.924
Myself, now I don't
run into walls. It hurts.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.400
Listen, you jerk,
you know that happens to be...

52:54.469 --> 52:57.131
the vice president of corporate finance
you were coming on to in there!

52:57.205 --> 53:01.198
- Oh, yeah? Well, you better help us.
- Thomas, you deserved it.

53:01.275 --> 53:04.972
You're not gonna bully me into this.
You're not gonna push me into anything.

53:05.046 --> 53:08.641
Oh, yeah? It's time you tell your boss
what you think of him. How about that?

53:08.716 --> 53:11.378
- Maybe I'll take your car for a spin.
- Yeah.

53:11.452 --> 53:15.286
- I didn't know you knew how to drive.
- I'll take a shot at it.

53:15.356 --> 53:17.984
Now, listen, listen.
Okay, okay? All right.

53:18.059 --> 53:20.323
We're gonna work something out.
We're gonna work something out.

53:20.395 --> 53:23.330
I am in such trouble. I have no idea how
to explain what just happened in there.

53:23.398 --> 53:25.332
You were in a car accident.

53:25.400 --> 53:29.564
The doctors mistakenly prescribed...
morphine and Percodan...

53:29.637 --> 53:32.663
causing temporary...
uh, ha-hallucinations.

53:32.740 --> 53:34.503
Percodan and morphine, right.

53:34.575 --> 53:38.477
- Could that happen?
- [Harrison] I have no idea.

53:41.816 --> 53:44.649
- [Milo] Turn the page!
- [Thomas] Okay.

53:44.719 --> 53:48.280
So this guy takes you
to heaven on a bus?

53:48.356 --> 53:50.347
A bus. Go figure.

53:50.425 --> 53:54.259
"Marco." Here he is.
Here he is.

53:54.328 --> 53:57.957
The bastard's still alive,
still living at the same address.

53:58.032 --> 54:01.365
- Okay, let's go. Come on, let's go!
- "Let's go"? Wait, wait!

54:01.436 --> 54:05.372
What? Where? When? You know,
what are you getting me into here?

54:05.440 --> 54:07.374
[Sighs]

54:07.442 --> 54:10.309
Okay.

54:10.378 --> 54:14.075
I stole a lot of things in my life.
But just from rich people, you know.

54:14.148 --> 54:17.845
But this one time,
I, um... I went too far.

54:17.919 --> 54:21.582
L... I was doing a job
for this guy, and, uh,

54:21.656 --> 54:24.454
he wanted to buy these stamps
from a ten-year-old kid.

54:24.525 --> 54:27.858
Stamps? This is about postage stamps?
That's great.

54:27.929 --> 54:32.332
Excuse me, the 1930 air mail
zeppelin stamp, full sheet.

54:32.400 --> 54:37.235
- It's gotta be worth $100,000 today.
- Huh.

54:37.305 --> 54:39.296
- See?
- So?

54:39.373 --> 54:42.308
So, um... anyway...

54:44.779 --> 54:47.247
the kid won't sell 'em,
no way, so...

54:47.315 --> 54:50.751
the guy has me go back...
and steal 'em.

54:54.222 --> 54:56.520
Lowest thing I ever did.

54:59.127 --> 55:02.255
Once I gave them back,
I was gonna go straight,

55:02.330 --> 55:06.289
but... next thing I know,
I'm dead.

55:06.367 --> 55:08.562
So...

55:08.636 --> 55:11.070
I'm a bad guy forever.

55:18.813 --> 55:20.906
Let's go.

55:27.021 --> 55:31.515
[Julia] He's coming back.
He looks happy.

55:35.796 --> 55:37.957
- I found them.
He's still got 'em. Let's go.
- Yes!

55:38.032 --> 55:41.399
I c-can't. I'm sorry. You know what
this is? This is grand larceny.

55:41.469 --> 55:44.336
No, it's not. It's breaking and
entering. It's 90 days to a year, max.

55:44.405 --> 55:47.863
Milo, you understand?
If you get caught, Thomas goes to jail.

55:47.942 --> 55:51.537
Well, we're not gonna get caught, okay?
I'm a professional.

55:51.612 --> 55:55.070
All right? Marco's upstairs taking
a shower. That gives us five minutes.

55:55.149 --> 55:57.709
- We're in, we're out. Piece of cake.
- No, I'm... God!

55:57.785 --> 56:00.811
This happened 33 years ago.
Does it even matter now?

56:00.888 --> 56:04.722
Thomas, I gotta
set it right. Okay?

56:04.792 --> 56:08.728
You don't get it?
It matters to me.

56:11.866 --> 56:15.962
Okay, but if I'm gonna let you
in my body, you have to behave.

56:16.037 --> 56:18.130
- I will. Okay.
- Okay.

56:18.206 --> 56:20.197
- And be careful.
- Okay.

56:20.274 --> 56:22.674
- Okay. Okay.
- I will... behave.

56:22.743 --> 56:25.405
Thomas, I want your body.
[Laughs]

56:25.479 --> 56:27.640
It's not funny.
Just get in and get it over with.

56:27.715 --> 56:31.481
Where's that little kid I had so much
fun with, huh? Where did he go?

56:36.357 --> 56:39.121
God, the man's tense,
you know what I mean?

56:39.193 --> 56:43.391
Okay, ah... where's that stuff you...
Oh, I forgot, I'm him.

56:43.464 --> 56:46.627
- [Chuckles]
- Let's go.

56:53.007 --> 56:55.066
Let me go.

56:58.279 --> 57:01.112
Okay, come on.

57:08.789 --> 57:12.782
- [Barking]
- [Screaming]

57:17.865 --> 57:21.266
[Screaming,
Barking Continues]

57:23.904 --> 57:28.034
- Piece of cake? I'm a piece of dog food!
- We're okay.

57:28.109 --> 57:30.737
[Barking Continues]

57:30.811 --> 57:32.904
Hey, shut up,
you little chihuahua!

57:32.980 --> 57:35.676
- Thomas!
- Hey, hey, hey.

57:35.750 --> 57:37.911
What the hell?

57:41.922 --> 57:44.755
Who the hell do you
think you are?

57:44.825 --> 57:47.919
- [Sizzling]
- Hey, hey, watch out! Watch out!

57:49.397 --> 57:51.592
[Grunts]

57:53.768 --> 57:57.602
- Not this time, Marco.
- Who are you?

57:57.672 --> 58:00.163
Oh, it's Milo.
Remember me?

58:00.241 --> 58:03.267
Milo? No,
that guy's dead.

58:03.344 --> 58:06.177
- Well, not at the moment.
- [Grunts]

58:06.247 --> 58:08.579
Milo!

58:08.649 --> 58:12.050
Stealing from a kid?
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

58:12.119 --> 58:14.849
[Barking Continues]

58:31.472 --> 58:33.940
There was a house.
Had a house here.

58:34.008 --> 58:36.169
Is this the way
professionals do it?

58:36.244 --> 58:39.304
Because I have never met a professional
who has fouled up this big!

58:39.380 --> 58:41.575
You didn't see a dog.
You didn't check for a dog!

58:41.649 --> 58:43.674
Don't yell at a man
on a ledge.

58:43.751 --> 58:47.312
Come on, don't get so upset.
I'll just do a... little...

58:47.388 --> 58:50.551
- acrobatic type thing.
- "Acrobatic type thing"?

58:52.126 --> 58:55.493
- What do you think you're doing?
- He's not a Flying Walenda!

58:55.563 --> 58:57.531
Here, you wanna take over,
Harrison?

58:57.598 --> 59:00.362
Oh, I hope you know what you're doing.
That's not your body.

59:00.434 --> 59:03.494
- No problem.
- [Electricity Crackling]

59:06.240 --> 59:08.174
- I'm okay.
- [Screaming]

59:08.242 --> 59:11.939
[Grunts]
I got it. I got it.

59:12.013 --> 59:15.574
[Screaming Continues]

59:18.653 --> 59:22.350
[Grunts] Hey, what'd I tell you?
I'm a professional.

59:22.423 --> 59:26.519
- I got it.
- [Screaming]

59:28.296 --> 59:30.389
[Grunting]

59:30.464 --> 59:35.458
Whew, and not a bruise
on him... mostly.

59:35.536 --> 59:37.163
You're lucky
you're already dead.

59:37.238 --> 59:40.674
- You don't think, Milo.
- Thomas could have been killed!

59:40.741 --> 59:43.403
Let's not kill me until
everyone else has had a chance.

59:43.477 --> 59:46.935
- We didn't get caught.
What's the big deal?
- Excuse me, sir.

59:47.014 --> 59:48.777
Is there a problem,
Officer?

59:48.849 --> 59:51.340
I'd say so.
Doesn't seem to be your day.

59:51.419 --> 59:53.751
You're parked next to
a fire hydrant.

59:53.821 --> 59:56.312
- [Sighs]
- [Laughing]

59:56.390 --> 59:58.324
Is that all?

59:58.392 --> 01:00:03.022
It would be, except for the $2,600
you have in outstanding parking tickets.

01:00:03.097 --> 01:00:05.895
Ya see?
You get in trouble without me too.

01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:07.935
- Shut up.
- What?

01:00:09.603 --> 01:00:12.037
[Harrison] Milo, if it weren't
for you, I would never have...

01:00:12.106 --> 01:00:14.199
- gotten to ride on one of these.
- Ya see?

01:00:14.275 --> 01:00:17.244
Something good
comes outta everything.

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:25.946
[Man] That's $2,600
for the tickets.

01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:30.616
With interest and penalty fees
that comes to $3,228.

01:00:30.691 --> 01:00:33.182
[Thomas] Ten percent interest?
In this economy?

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:36.161
- Just say, "Thank you, Sergeant."
- Thank you, Sergeant.

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:38.095
Thank you
for shopping with us.

01:00:38.165 --> 01:00:40.759
[Milo]
So far, so good, huh?

01:00:40.835 --> 01:00:43.827
[Thomas] Shut up!
I'm out $3,000!

01:00:43.904 --> 01:00:47.533
- [Milo] Put it on my tab, Tommy.
- Tab? What tab?

01:00:47.608 --> 01:00:50.771
By the way, don't call me Tommy!
You are not my friends!

01:00:50.845 --> 01:00:53.643
[Harrison] It's exactly that attitude
that alienates people.

01:00:53.714 --> 01:00:56.182
[Thomas]
I forgot about Anne! Her parents!

01:00:56.250 --> 01:00:59.845
[Harrison] Does it bother anyone else
that this is a one-way street?

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.979
- [Honking, Screeching Continues]
- [Yelling]

01:01:03.557 --> 01:01:05.548
[Anne]
He gets so busy.

01:01:05.626 --> 01:01:08.026
He never knows what
his schedule's gonna be.

01:01:08.095 --> 01:01:12.361
- They really rely on him at work.
- Don't worry about it, darling.

01:01:12.433 --> 01:01:14.424
- Maybe we'll meet him tomorrow.
- Hmm.

01:01:14.502 --> 01:01:16.868
- Bye.
- Yeah, he really wants to meet you.

01:01:16.937 --> 01:01:18.871
- Bye-bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

01:01:18.939 --> 01:01:21.407
It must have been some kind
of emergency at work.

01:01:21.475 --> 01:01:24.410
- Bankruptcies can be unpredictable.
- Relax, honey.

01:01:24.478 --> 01:01:28.471
- We'll give him another chance.
Then we'll kill him.
- [Laughs]

01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:30.483
[Car Engine Starting]

01:01:35.056 --> 01:01:37.957
- [Horns Honking, Tires Screeching]
- [Thomas] You jerk!

01:01:42.163 --> 01:01:44.097
[Milo] How long
is this gonna take?

01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:47.430
Hey. I happen to care about
this woman. Okay?

01:01:47.501 --> 01:01:50.061
Do you mind if I keep
one thing in my life on track?

01:01:50.137 --> 01:01:54.904
Anne!
Hi. I'm sorry.

01:01:54.975 --> 01:01:57.671
- I'm really sorry. You're angry.
- Don't be sorry.

01:01:57.745 --> 01:01:59.679
- I can tell.
- I was angry.

01:01:59.747 --> 01:02:02.341
I've been through concern,
worry, annoyance.

01:02:02.416 --> 01:02:05.249
- Where are you now?
- I'm fine.

01:02:05.319 --> 01:02:08.550
- I had a great time with my parents.
- Uh-huh.

01:02:08.622 --> 01:02:11.250
- You could have called.
- I know, I should have called.

01:02:11.325 --> 01:02:13.623
- I'm sorry I didn't.
- Let's just face it.

01:02:13.694 --> 01:02:16.561
We get along okay,
but things are not going...

01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:19.565
Wait. What do you mean,
"okay"?

01:02:19.633 --> 01:02:22.830
I think there's more here
than just "okay." For me.

01:02:22.903 --> 01:02:24.837
Things aren't
going anywhere.

01:02:24.905 --> 01:02:27.533
Our relationship is not proceeding
along normal lines.

01:02:27.608 --> 01:02:33.240
- What is that supposed to mean?
- When normal people get involved,

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:36.545
they just naturally
take a natural course.

01:02:36.617 --> 01:02:39.814
Yeah.
It's like your keys.

01:02:39.887 --> 01:02:41.821
My keys.

01:02:41.889 --> 01:02:44.119
Yes. I don't even have
the keys to your apartment.

01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:48.457
- Okay, you want my keys.
- No. No, it's a symbol.

01:02:48.529 --> 01:02:51.794
A symbol of a relationship
that is going somewhere.

01:02:51.866 --> 01:02:53.891
- Are you listening?
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:02:53.968 --> 01:02:56.095
[Snaps Fingers]
I'm here, I'm here.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:59.230
We meet,
we are attracted,

01:02:59.306 --> 01:03:01.934
we trade keys
and you meet my parents.

01:03:02.009 --> 01:03:04.341
I'm aware of the significance
of parent-meeting.

01:03:04.411 --> 01:03:09.314
You think that I haven't screwed up
enough relationships to know that?

01:03:11.585 --> 01:03:15.453
- I want to meet your parents.
- You do?

01:03:15.523 --> 01:03:16.956
Mm-hmm.

01:03:17.024 --> 01:03:19.959
They have tickets
to a concert tomorrow night.

01:03:20.027 --> 01:03:21.961
- Great.
- No way. We can't.

01:03:22.029 --> 01:03:25.430
- Thomas, we need you.
- Mmm, I can't do it tomorrow night.

01:03:25.499 --> 01:03:28.400
- Aw, Jesus.
- Anne, please.

01:03:28.469 --> 01:03:31.267
Things are
really complicated for me.

01:03:31.338 --> 01:03:33.306
At work.

01:03:33.374 --> 01:03:35.672
Okay? Th-There are
these people in town.

01:03:35.743 --> 01:03:39.873
Four very pushy and annoying people,
okay, from this damn bankruptcy.

01:03:39.947 --> 01:03:42.211
But I swear to god
I wanna meet your parents.

01:03:42.283 --> 01:03:45.446
I'll walk to San Diego
on my knees to meet them.

01:03:45.519 --> 01:03:48.420
- On your knees?
- Yes.

01:03:48.489 --> 01:03:50.480
In a new suit, I hope?

01:03:50.558 --> 01:03:54.050
Yes, in a new suit. You have no idea.
They're... You know.

01:03:54.128 --> 01:03:57.029
- I'm still mad.
- You have every right to be.

01:03:59.633 --> 01:04:02.898
- Good night.
- Good night. I'll call you.

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:04.904
- Good night.
- 'Night.

01:04:07.474 --> 01:04:11.137
I like her.
She's strong without being pushy.

01:04:11.212 --> 01:04:13.840
I like her too,
but I gotta return these stamps.

01:04:13.914 --> 01:04:17.543
- I'm sorry. Let's go. I'll be brief.
- Very nice.

01:04:25.826 --> 01:04:29.023
- Okay, you stay in bed.
- God, I hope it's the right guy.

01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:32.395
How many Duane Dortmuellers
could there be?

01:04:32.466 --> 01:04:35.594
- Yeah?
- It's him.

01:04:42.943 --> 01:04:45.503
Look down.
Look down, for God's sakes!

- Wha...

01:04:48.382 --> 01:04:50.316
Gimme...

Honey!
Look at this!

01:04:59.727 --> 01:05:02.662
- It's the stamps!
- [Door Closing]

01:05:02.730 --> 01:05:06.689
[Laughing]

01:05:06.767 --> 01:05:10.362
- I did it!
- [Laughing]

01:05:14.508 --> 01:05:17.875
[Laughs] That was great!
Wasn't that great?

01:05:17.945 --> 01:05:21.437
- I'd say... that was great.
- That was great.

01:05:21.515 --> 01:05:24.814
- He looked so happy.
- This is gonna work! We can do this!

01:05:24.885 --> 01:05:28.048
- Oooh
- You did a good thing. Smile!

01:05:28.122 --> 01:05:31.250
You remember smiling?
Open your lips, show your teeth.

01:05:31.325 --> 01:05:34.089
Wa-wa walk

01:05:34.161 --> 01:05:40.031
- Oooh
- Like a man

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.034
- Bye-aye, baby
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:05:42.102 --> 01:05:44.036
- I don't mean maybe
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:05:44.104 --> 01:05:48.006
- Gonna get along somehow
- Ooh-wa-ooh-wa, ooh-wa-ooh

01:05:48.075 --> 01:05:50.009
- Soon you'll be cryin'
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:05:50.077 --> 01:05:52.011
- On account of all your lyin'
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:05:52.079 --> 01:05:54.639
But, yeah, just look
who's laughing now

01:05:54.715 --> 01:06:00.051
- I'm gonna
- Walk like a man, yeah
Fast as I can, yeah

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.920
Walk like a man
from you

01:06:03.991 --> 01:06:08.018
I'll tell the world
forget about it, girl

01:06:08.095 --> 01:06:12.555
And walk like a man
from you

01:06:12.633 --> 01:06:16.569
Oooh

01:06:21.275 --> 01:06:23.209
Oh, my God.

01:06:29.283 --> 01:06:31.274
I need one of you now.

01:06:35.122 --> 01:06:39.218
- Hello!
- Guess we're thinkin' about me, huh?

01:06:41.696 --> 01:06:45.063
[Sighing]

01:06:45.132 --> 01:06:48.966
Hey.
We had fun, huh?

01:06:49.036 --> 01:06:50.970
- Yeah.
- [Laughs]

01:06:51.038 --> 01:06:54.599
Buggin' you is what kept me
goin' all these years.

01:06:54.675 --> 01:06:56.643
[Laughs]

01:07:00.247 --> 01:07:02.909
You're the best mom
I ever knew, Penny.

01:07:02.983 --> 01:07:07.682
- You go find your kids, okay?
- Oh, Milo.

01:07:09.357 --> 01:07:11.325
- [Sighing]
- Milo,

01:07:11.392 --> 01:07:15.954
- try not to...
- What?

01:07:16.030 --> 01:07:18.430
- All of the above.
- [Laughs]

01:07:18.499 --> 01:07:21.491
Hope you meet a good-lookin'
angel up there.

01:07:24.138 --> 01:07:27.335
Go get 'em, buddy.

01:07:32.079 --> 01:07:36.880
Good luck, you know.
I mean, whatever. This is strange.

01:07:38.786 --> 01:07:40.378
I know.
[Laughs]

01:07:40.454 --> 01:07:43.252
[Clears Throat]

01:07:43.324 --> 01:07:46.452
Uh, listen.
[Chuckles]

01:07:46.527 --> 01:07:48.654
Listen to this.
Now.

01:07:48.729 --> 01:07:51.698
Why don't you come back
when we're all done...

01:07:51.766 --> 01:07:54.030
and then you could take us
all at once, you know?

01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:56.661
- Save you a lot of mileage.
- Hey, look, pal.

01:07:56.737 --> 01:07:59.865
I bought you every second I could,
but a new life's being created...

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:01.874
and it needs a soul now!

01:08:05.312 --> 01:08:08.770
You try to be a nice guy.

01:08:08.849 --> 01:08:11.875
I'll be back
for you guys soon.

01:08:14.522 --> 01:08:18.049
Hey, buckaroo.

01:08:18.125 --> 01:08:21.754
You really came through for me
back there. That meant a lot to me.

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:23.888
- Hey, Milo.
- What?

01:08:32.139 --> 01:08:34.073
So who's next?

01:08:34.140 --> 01:08:36.631
Who's next? Excuse me.

01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:40.975
Excuse me. I know I'm in the minority,
being the only living person here,

01:08:41.048 --> 01:08:44.676
but I do have a life and I have a job
that I occasionally go to.

01:08:44.752 --> 01:08:46.685
Thomas Reilly.

01:08:48.656 --> 01:08:51.352
All right. I'll cancel the morning.
I'll cancel the day.

01:08:51.425 --> 01:08:54.689
[Harrison Clears Throat]
I'm, uh... I'm not really comfortable.

01:08:54.761 --> 01:08:57.127
[Julia]
Will you stop making excuses?

01:08:57.198 --> 01:09:00.031
There are plenty of places
to sing.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:03.831
- There's jazz clubs, karaoke.
- [Clearing Throat]

01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:07.169
- Shoot, we could crash a wedding.
- It's 7:30 in the morning.

01:09:07.241 --> 01:09:09.175
The only people singing
are drunk.

01:09:09.243 --> 01:09:12.770
So look, we'll postpone
the singing, all right?

01:09:12.846 --> 01:09:15.212
What about you two?
Penny, Julia?

01:09:15.282 --> 01:09:18.774
John's farm is a couple hours drive.
Let's find Penny's kids.

01:09:18.853 --> 01:09:21.048
- It's okay?
- [Julia] Yeah.

01:09:21.121 --> 01:09:24.682
Okay, let's go for it. Nothing could
be harder than gettin' those stamps.

01:09:24.758 --> 01:09:28.785
Adoption records
from the 1950s are sealed.

01:09:28.863 --> 01:09:31.388
Even the adopted children
themselves...

01:09:31.465 --> 01:09:34.366
need a court order
to open them.

01:09:34.435 --> 01:09:36.960
- If they're lucky.
- A court order.

01:09:37.037 --> 01:09:41.098
- How long does that take?
- Too long.

01:09:41.175 --> 01:09:43.473
Plus a month.

01:09:45.145 --> 01:09:48.511
- [Thomas] Do you live around here?
- Who are you, the man?

01:09:48.582 --> 01:09:52.245
I'm not a cop. I'm trying to
help this lady find her kids.

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:54.252
What lady?

01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:57.654
She lived here in the '50s.
Her name is...

01:09:57.725 --> 01:10:00.717
[Harrison] This is something.
A bunch of people that don't exist...

01:10:00.794 --> 01:10:02.728
Looking for children
that don't exist.

01:10:02.796 --> 01:10:06.789
- We'll never find her kids.
- Here she comes. Shh!

01:10:06.867 --> 01:10:10.701
It's no use. Nobody here will
ever remember me or my children.

01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:12.705
Oh, Penny, come on.
We just started.

01:10:12.773 --> 01:10:14.866
We'll try
a couple of other places.

01:10:14.942 --> 01:10:17.001
Was there a store
you went to a lot?

01:10:17.077 --> 01:10:19.671
We could go by, ask there.
Or church.

01:10:19.747 --> 01:10:22.443
- Did you go to church?
- [Cats Meowing]

01:10:27.555 --> 01:10:30.285
Could she
still be alive?

01:10:34.194 --> 01:10:36.924
I know
where the girls are.

01:10:36.997 --> 01:10:38.862
- [Gasps]
- Where?

01:10:38.933 --> 01:10:42.266
They sent me birthday cards
for a while.

01:10:42.336 --> 01:10:44.896
- What sweet children.
- Yes, they are.

01:10:44.972 --> 01:10:48.066
- Especially Diane. She's so thoughtful.
- Where?

01:10:48.142 --> 01:10:51.236
Oh, they sent them
to Sacramento.

01:10:51.312 --> 01:10:54.076
There was
a nice family there.

01:10:55.482 --> 01:10:57.916
Name of, uh...

01:10:57.985 --> 01:11:00.545
Name of...

01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:03.715
Timmer... Timmerson.
That's it, Timmerson.

01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.887
Little Billy, though,
I lost track of him.

01:11:10.965 --> 01:11:14.401
- They put him in a foster home.
- Oh!

01:11:14.468 --> 01:11:17.335
And then they kept
moving him around.

01:11:17.404 --> 01:11:21.135
Thomas, what are we
gonna do about Billy?

01:11:21.208 --> 01:11:24.302
Those girls might know
where he is, though.

01:11:31.418 --> 01:11:33.352
[Horns Honking]

01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:35.820
I don't believe
this damn traffic!

01:11:38.492 --> 01:11:40.858
- W-Where are they all going?
- [Julia] Don't worry, Penny.

01:11:40.928 --> 01:11:43.021
It's gonna be okay.
We're gonna get there.

01:11:43.097 --> 01:11:47.090
This is silly. We can't drive two hours
to Sacramento. It's not fair to you.

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:51.160
- It's not fair to Harrison.
- Don't worry. I'm happy to go last.

01:11:51.238 --> 01:11:53.502
In fact, I've always
wanted to see Sacramento.

01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:58.477
I can't believe you're trying to wiggle
out of it. Talk about your last chance.

01:11:58.545 --> 01:12:01.070
W-What do you mean?
John's farm is on the way, isn't it?

01:12:01.148 --> 01:12:04.276
- I've always wanted to see John's farm.
- Wait a minute. Thomas.

01:12:04.351 --> 01:12:07.320
Find someplace to pull over.
Come on, pull over.

01:12:07.388 --> 01:12:09.822
Look where
these people are going.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.358
[Harrison] I don't wanna be here.
I don't feel that well.

01:12:12.426 --> 01:12:15.190
I-I think I have
a cold coming on. A flu!

01:12:15.262 --> 01:12:17.992
- [Harrison Clears Throat]
- [Julia] Stop complaining.

01:12:18.065 --> 01:12:20.397
- Nah. They're sold out.
- Oh, sh...

01:12:20.467 --> 01:12:22.435
- That's it, let's go.
- Will you stop it?

01:12:22.503 --> 01:12:26.132
- They're sold out! We can't get in.
- We gotta find another place.

01:12:26.206 --> 01:12:28.572
No, we don't.
No, we don't.

01:12:28.642 --> 01:12:30.576
- You just need a little help.
- No, no, no.

01:12:30.644 --> 01:12:32.612
- Do it!
- Don't look at me like that.

01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.614
- Do it!
- Not without my permission.

01:12:34.682 --> 01:12:37.446
- May I please?
- Oh, God. No!

01:12:37.518 --> 01:12:39.509
- Aaaah!
- It's sold out!

01:12:49.797 --> 01:12:53.096
Excuse me. If you're gonna be back here,
you have to have a pass.

01:12:53.167 --> 01:12:55.328
A pass?

01:12:55.402 --> 01:12:58.064
A pass!

01:12:58.138 --> 01:13:00.129
I'm gonna pass
some information onto you.

01:13:00.207 --> 01:13:04.075
Youse bozos outside got their trucks
blockin' my car in. My Rolls Royce.

01:13:04.144 --> 01:13:07.113
- Where did you park?
- Are you listenin' to me?

01:13:07.181 --> 01:13:11.743
I said I parked between your trucks!
That's why I can't move.

01:13:11.819 --> 01:13:15.516
Don't you give me attitude.
I'm a mother!

01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:19.252
No, I mean, I'm a...
I'm a doctor!

01:13:19.326 --> 01:13:22.955
I'm a surgeon. I come down here
as a favor to Mr. King.

01:13:23.030 --> 01:13:25.965
His hands are insured for $1,000,000.
The insurance company's not gonna...

01:13:26.033 --> 01:13:28.866
let him walk out on stage until
they had him checked out by me!

01:13:28.936 --> 01:13:33.464
Meanwhile, I got a medical emergency,
but I can't get my damn car out!

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:36.065
- Sir, just calm down.
- Calm down? I am calm.

01:13:36.143 --> 01:13:39.601
You want loud?
I will get loud...

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.671
- if you want me to get loud!
- No, no, no! I, uh...

01:13:41.749 --> 01:13:45.742
You get that manager right now, get his
butt down here and I might calm down.

01:13:45.819 --> 01:13:48.617
- Fine. I'll take you to him.
- I'm not goin' anywhere!

01:13:48.689 --> 01:13:52.056
You bring him to me.
I'm a doctor!

01:13:52.126 --> 01:13:55.562
I'll be right back.

01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:57.597
[Laughing]

01:14:06.705 --> 01:14:09.731
- Not bad.
- Drama class, City College.

01:14:09.808 --> 01:14:13.972
- You got us in.
- Harrison, take it away!

01:14:14.046 --> 01:14:17.277
What? You expect me to get up
in front of all those people?

01:14:17.349 --> 01:14:20.785
- They don't wanna see me.
- They can't see you!

01:14:20.853 --> 01:14:24.619
- Yeah, but I can see them!
- Penny, what exactly is your plan?

01:14:24.690 --> 01:14:26.817
My plan was to
get you in here.

01:14:26.892 --> 01:14:29.759
You're in, now you two
get out there and sing!

01:14:29.828 --> 01:14:31.989
The second I walk out there,
they're gonna grab me.

01:14:32.064 --> 01:14:33.998
We should be in Sacramento.

01:14:34.066 --> 01:14:36.626
Thomas, you gotta
make him do it.

01:14:36.702 --> 01:14:39.671
It's very important to him,
whether he admits it or not.

01:14:39.738 --> 01:14:42.002
It's not that important.

01:14:47.413 --> 01:14:50.871
What? No! No!
Ooooh, no!

01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:53.612
- Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
- [Crowd Murmuring]

01:14:53.686 --> 01:14:55.881
Please rise
for our national anthem.

01:14:55.955 --> 01:14:59.220
You gotta be kiddin'!

01:14:59.291 --> 01:15:02.988
Dear God, Thomas, that's
an incredibly difficult piece!

01:15:03.062 --> 01:15:07.055
[Julia] Perfect! Sing it right,
they're gonna know you're good!

01:15:07.132 --> 01:15:10.533
[Murmuring Continues]

01:15:11.470 --> 01:15:13.563
They bought it.

01:15:17.376 --> 01:15:20.174
- You're on.
- Okay, Harrison, I'm all yours.

01:15:20.245 --> 01:15:22.941
- I can't even remember the words.
- Get your butt in there.

01:15:28.554 --> 01:15:32.217
- Come on, man!
- To see B.B. King!

01:15:32.291 --> 01:15:35.226
- Come on, man!
- Let's go!

01:15:35.294 --> 01:15:37.159
I can't.
I can't!

01:15:37.229 --> 01:15:39.629
What are you doing?

01:15:39.698 --> 01:15:43.259
Look at me. I'm not even alive
and I'm perspiring!

01:15:43.335 --> 01:15:46.600
You better not do this, Harrison.
Listen! This is it!

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:49.004
Who came up with this
ridiculous concept anyway?

01:15:49.074 --> 01:15:52.373
Resolve your entire life in
one bold stroke? What if I fail?

01:15:52.444 --> 01:15:56.505
And I will, I'll fail.
I'm telling you, I always fail.

01:15:56.582 --> 01:15:59.779
Then my whole life
will be a complete failure.

01:15:59.852 --> 01:16:03.447
No offense, Harrison, but you died
a failure because you never tried.

01:16:17.002 --> 01:16:20.768
[Murmuring Continues]

01:16:28.447 --> 01:16:33.714
Oh, say, can you see

01:16:33.786 --> 01:16:39.315
By the dawn's early light

01:16:39.391 --> 01:16:41.325
Wha...

01:16:43.629 --> 01:16:45.563
What so proudly we hailed.

01:16:45.631 --> 01:16:49.533
What so proudly we hailed

01:16:49.601 --> 01:16:55.506
At the twilight's
last gleaming

01:16:55.574 --> 01:17:00.773
Whose broad stripes
and bright stars

01:17:00.846 --> 01:17:06.648
Through
the perilous fight

01:17:06.718 --> 01:17:12.281
O'er the ramparts
we watched

01:17:12.357 --> 01:17:18.592
Were so gallantly streaming

01:17:18.664 --> 01:17:24.102
And the rocket's
red glare

01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:28.936

- [Crowd Cheering]

01:17:39.518 --> 01:17:42.715
[Guitar]

01:17:42.788 --> 01:17:49.091
- Gave proof through the night
- [Band]

01:17:49.161 --> 01:17:54.656
- That our flag was still there
- [Band Continues]

01:17:54.733 --> 01:18:01.104
Oh, say, does
that star-spangled

01:18:01.173 --> 01:18:07.601
Banner yet wave

01:18:07.679 --> 01:18:10.011
[Crowd Cheering]

01:18:10.082 --> 01:18:18.456
O'er the land
of the free

01:18:18.524 --> 01:18:21.755
And the home

01:18:21.827 --> 01:18:24.625
Of the

01:18:24.696 --> 01:18:32.398
Brave

01:18:36.909 --> 01:18:39.104
- Bravo!
- Harrison, you did it!

01:18:50.389 --> 01:18:54.018
Bravo!
Bravo, Harrison!

01:19:03.702 --> 01:19:08.036
[Band:
"The Thrill Is Gone"]

01:19:09.374 --> 01:19:13.708
Thank you, Thomas.
Thank you for believing in me.

01:19:33.632 --> 01:19:35.862
I'm going on tour,
you know.

01:19:38.003 --> 01:19:39.937
Thrill is gone

01:19:43.375 --> 01:19:46.071
The thrill is gone away

01:19:49.181 --> 01:19:54.118
The thrill is gone, baby

01:19:54.186 --> 01:19:59.681
The thrill is gone away

01:19:59.758 --> 01:20:03.785
You done me wrong, baby

01:20:03.862 --> 01:20:07.764
You'll be sorry

01:20:07.833 --> 01:20:11.200
Don't get him mad.
Be really nice, Thomas.

01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:14.205
We have to
get out of here fast.

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:19.572
Welcome back, Mr. Reilly.
How's show biz?

01:20:19.645 --> 01:20:23.172
I assure you, Sergeant.
I'm not drunk, I'm not on drugs.

01:20:23.248 --> 01:20:27.048
Your blood test shows that.
So what is wrong with you?

01:20:27.119 --> 01:20:31.579
- [Phone Ringing]
- It was just... somethin' I had to do?

01:20:31.657 --> 01:20:35.184
I'm going to assume that you've gotten
whatever it is out of your system.

01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:38.423
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm gonna release you.

01:20:38.497 --> 01:20:40.632
- Thank you, Sergeant.
It's the last you'll see of me.
- Bail is set at $300.

01:20:40.632 --> 01:20:42.293
- Thank you, Sergeant.
It's the last you'll see of me.
- Bail is set at $300.

01:20:42.367 --> 01:20:46.497
- All right. Can I get something to eat?
- It has to be to go.

01:20:46.571 --> 01:20:48.869
- God!
- Oh, Thomas.

01:20:48.940 --> 01:20:53.138
Anne! Hi!
God, what a night! God...

01:20:53.211 --> 01:20:56.009
- How did you know I was here?
- I saw you get arrested.

01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:59.516
I was at the concert
with my mother and father.

01:20:59.584 --> 01:21:03.020
- This is really unfair.
- How could you do that to me?

01:21:03.087 --> 01:21:05.351
- Baby...
- Don't call me baby.

01:21:05.423 --> 01:21:08.756
- I have hung in there a long time.
- I know!

01:21:08.826 --> 01:21:11.158
- You lied to me!
You said you had to work.
- I'm sorry.

01:21:11.229 --> 01:21:13.754
You didn't say you had to sing
the national anthem and get arrested!

01:21:13.831 --> 01:21:15.765
But I didn't know
I was gonna do that!

01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:18.563
It was just
a spur of the moment thing?

01:21:18.636 --> 01:21:21.230
Yeah! Actually,
actually, it was.

01:21:21.305 --> 01:21:25.139
And how come I don't even know
you can sing like that?

01:21:25.209 --> 01:21:28.337
- You keep that a secret.
- Because, because...

01:21:28.413 --> 01:21:32.816
Because I don't do it
very often. That's why!

01:21:32.884 --> 01:21:37.514
- Was it okay?
- Yeah, it was good. It was really good.

01:21:37.588 --> 01:21:42.355
It's like you're leading a double life:
Banker, lunatic, performance artist.

01:21:42.427 --> 01:21:44.691
Damn it, Anne, are you
gonna let me explain?

01:21:44.762 --> 01:21:47.856
Yes! Explain.
I'm ready.

01:21:52.403 --> 01:21:55.998
- Well, that clears it up for me!
- Anne, come on.

01:21:56.074 --> 01:21:58.406
- Oh, God, I feel like such a jerk.
- Sweetheart.

01:21:58.476 --> 01:22:00.740
You're acting like this is
Days Of Our Lives!

01:22:00.812 --> 01:22:03.212
[Penny] Thomas, do not argue.
Just apologize!

01:22:03.281 --> 01:22:05.442
- Anne, I'm sorry. I apologize.
- Good-bye, Thomas.

01:22:05.516 --> 01:22:09.008
- Yeah, do this to me. Go away. Anne.
- [Car Engine Starting]

01:22:09.087 --> 01:22:11.954
Anne, let's be grown-ups.

01:22:12.023 --> 01:22:14.491
- Anne!
- [Tires Screeching]

01:22:19.564 --> 01:22:21.498
Shit!

01:22:21.566 --> 01:22:23.591
- You let her go.
- I did not let her go.

01:22:23.668 --> 01:22:25.636
- You did.
- You did.

01:22:25.703 --> 01:22:28.570
What am I supposed to do?
Jump in front of the car?

01:22:28.639 --> 01:22:30.869
You guys are a lot of help.
Come on.

01:22:32.443 --> 01:22:35.037
- Maybe you should call her.
- We think you should call her.

01:22:35.113 --> 01:22:37.343
- No. Enough!
- You'd feel better.

01:22:37.415 --> 01:22:40.578
Have you forgotten your basic problem?
We've gotta keep moving.

01:22:43.621 --> 01:22:48.058
- [Gasps]
- Oh, boy. Bad sound.

01:22:48.126 --> 01:22:53.655
That's all right. I'll be quick.
I'll just give him the rest of my money.

01:23:02.473 --> 01:23:06.170
Mr. Reilly, is it
something genetic with you?

01:23:15.019 --> 01:23:18.079
Tell me you're not insured,
and you'll be three for three.

01:23:18.156 --> 01:23:22.252
- No, I'm heavily insured, I promise.
- Ouch! Aaah!

01:23:27.698 --> 01:23:30.724
- Penny, I'll tell him to take me.
- No, no.

01:23:30.802 --> 01:23:32.736
I am so sorry.

01:23:32.804 --> 01:23:35.170
- All right, you're sorry.
Can we get on with this?
- [Baby Crying]

01:23:35.239 --> 01:23:38.436
- [Woman] She wants you.
- It's all right, sweetheart.

01:23:39.744 --> 01:23:41.939
- Mr. Hug-a-bug
- I really have to go.

01:23:42.013 --> 01:23:44.538
- Hug-a-bug, Hug-a-bug Bear
- Can I give you
my license and insurance?

01:23:44.615 --> 01:23:49.314
- You can mail 'em to me.
- When you try and find him

01:23:49.387 --> 01:23:52.413
He won't be there

01:23:52.490 --> 01:23:57.621
But when you're feeling blue
and a little bit scared

01:23:57.695 --> 01:24:00.095
- Thomas! That's...
- He'll be right beside you

01:24:00.164 --> 01:24:02.962
- That's the song
you used to sing to Thomas.
- Mr. Hug-a-bug Bear

01:24:03.034 --> 01:24:06.003
- I remember.
- I-I made that up!

01:24:06.070 --> 01:24:09.233
I used to sing it to my kids before
I put 'em to bed. They loved it.

01:24:09.307 --> 01:24:12.470
- Especially Billy.
- And a little bit scared

01:24:12.543 --> 01:24:16.104
He'll be right beside you

01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.614
Mr. Hug-a-bug Bear

01:24:18.683 --> 01:24:22.084
- Why? Wait a minute. We had a deal.
- Wait.

01:24:22.153 --> 01:24:24.121
- Come on.
- Give her a minute.

01:24:24.188 --> 01:24:28.921
- What is the matter with him?
- I have only myself to blame.

01:24:28.993 --> 01:24:32.656
I put him
back out on the street.

01:24:32.730 --> 01:24:35.426
Ask him.
Ask him if he's Billy!

01:24:35.499 --> 01:24:39.026
Are you... Billy?

01:24:39.103 --> 01:24:43.540
- Is your name Billy? Your first name?
- To my friends.

01:24:43.608 --> 01:24:46.600
Ask him, Thomas.
Ask him if he was adopted.

01:24:46.677 --> 01:24:49.840
Sgt. Barclay, I was wondering if you
ever might happen to, maybe, be adopted.

01:24:49.914 --> 01:24:52.644
If you don't shut up I'm gonna
take you back inside.

01:24:52.717 --> 01:24:57.279
- He was! You can tell, Thomas!
- I know I sound absolutely nuts.

01:24:57.355 --> 01:25:00.620
Was your mother's name
Penny Washington?

01:25:00.691 --> 01:25:04.388
- Billy!
- [Screams]

01:25:04.462 --> 01:25:07.397
This is my...
This is...

01:25:07.465 --> 01:25:08.898
What is this about?

01:25:08.966 --> 01:25:11.867
You've got two older sisters,
Shirley and Diane?

01:25:11.936 --> 01:25:15.633
- Am I right?
- Who are you?

01:25:15.706 --> 01:25:20.837
Is this some sort of sick joke? Did
I lock your brother up or something?

01:25:20.912 --> 01:25:22.846
Do you know where
your sisters are?

01:25:22.914 --> 01:25:25.314
- No.
- I do.

01:25:25.383 --> 01:25:27.317
- That's ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

01:25:27.385 --> 01:25:30.479
I've tried to find my sisters
for 20 years. The records
are sealed, even for a cop.

01:25:30.554 --> 01:25:35.218
But remember this lady? This lady
with a million cats? Agnes Miller?

01:25:35.293 --> 01:25:38.421
She still lives in
your old neighborhood.

01:25:38.496 --> 01:25:41.056
- I do remember a lady with cats.
- I know you remember Agnes.

01:25:41.132 --> 01:25:45.398
Call her. Then call a family
named Timmerson in Sacramento.

01:25:45.469 --> 01:25:47.403
That's where
your sisters grew up.

01:25:47.471 --> 01:25:51.407
- How can you possibly know any of this?
- This is my grandbaby!

01:25:51.475 --> 01:25:54.239
My goodness!
Look at that child.

01:25:54.312 --> 01:25:57.179
- Julia, she's so cute.
- She's adorable.

01:25:57.248 --> 01:25:59.443
That's his wife.
Come here.

01:25:59.517 --> 01:26:02.782
- Come. This is... Come here.
- No, I don't wanna get involved.

01:26:02.853 --> 01:26:05.686
- But this is who l...
- No, really. I'm gonna... Come on.

01:26:05.756 --> 01:26:09.487
Your mother and my mother wound up
in the same emergency room.

01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:12.552
My parents told me
that before she died,

01:26:12.630 --> 01:26:14.962
she was talkin' about
her kids...

01:26:15.032 --> 01:26:18.729
and all she wanted was to make sure
that her kids were all right.

01:26:18.803 --> 01:26:21.397
And she sang that song.

01:26:21.472 --> 01:26:24.066
- I guess she was delirious by then.
- Hug-a-bug

01:26:24.141 --> 01:26:26.666
- But my mom taught it to me.
- Hug-a-bug Bear

01:26:26.744 --> 01:26:29.110
So when I heard you singing it,
I just knew.

01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:33.139
When you try and find him
he won't be there

01:26:33.217 --> 01:26:35.947
Your mother loved you
very much.

01:26:38.022 --> 01:26:40.149
She would have been
real proud of you.

01:26:40.224 --> 01:26:42.818
- Thomas, I have to do this.
- No.

01:26:48.499 --> 01:26:50.899
I never left you.

01:26:57.508 --> 01:27:00.341
Can you just get off of me?

01:27:00.411 --> 01:27:02.709
Yeah, I'm sorry.
That was... Eee.

01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:05.578
It's an emotional time
for us all.

01:27:05.649 --> 01:27:08.174
I'm gonna check this out,
Reilly.

01:27:08.252 --> 01:27:10.584
- And if it isn't true...
- It's true.

01:27:10.654 --> 01:27:14.556
Believe me, it's true.

01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:17.321
Come on, sweetheart.

01:27:18.262 --> 01:27:20.492
He's such a cop!
"I'm gonna check this out."

01:27:20.564 --> 01:27:22.794
That was really humiliating.

01:27:26.704 --> 01:27:29.867
- [Sighing]
- [Car Engine Starting, Revving]

01:27:32.376 --> 01:27:35.277
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Finally.

01:27:35.346 --> 01:27:39.544
- Good-bye, darlin'.
- [Julia Laughing]

01:27:39.617 --> 01:27:42.518
You take care.

01:27:42.586 --> 01:27:46.113
I'll remember you,
Julia.

01:27:47.658 --> 01:27:49.455
I'm really gonna miss you.

01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:55.394
I'm saying good-bye
to both my sons.

01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:05.707
- Thomas, don't work too hard.
- Okay.

01:28:05.776 --> 01:28:09.047
And it's okay
to be a good guy.

01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:12.547
Pay more attention to what
you're eating. Julia, hi to John.

01:28:12.617 --> 01:28:15.745
You stop driving so fast
and call your mother once in a while.

01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:18.618
I love you guys!

01:28:21.859 --> 01:28:24.419
Hit it.

01:28:40.711 --> 01:28:42.645
[Sighing]

01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:47.884
[Rooster Crowing]

01:28:53.458 --> 01:28:55.392
[Thunder Rumbling]

01:29:09.574 --> 01:29:12.566
- Think it's okay?
- Uh, yeah. It's good.

01:29:12.643 --> 01:29:15.635
- He'll believe it?
- He's gotta recognize your handwriting.

01:29:15.713 --> 01:29:19.308
Let's go.

01:29:19.383 --> 01:29:22.648
Here's what we'll do. I'll tell him
that after the bus accident,

01:29:22.720 --> 01:29:26.087
your stuff got mixed up with
my mom's stuff at the hospital, and...

01:29:26.157 --> 01:29:29.126
I just happened
to find this letter.

01:29:31.629 --> 01:29:35.326
- What?
- He'll buy it. I'll be convincing.

01:29:35.399 --> 01:29:38.232
Aw, shit!

01:29:44.075 --> 01:29:46.441
They're trying to lose me?

01:30:07.365 --> 01:30:09.299
Come on.

01:30:15.373 --> 01:30:19.673
- I do you a favor,
you run from me like rabbits.
- Five minutes, okay?

01:30:19.744 --> 01:30:23.180
- Just give us five minutes!
- No! It's time on the big clock.

01:30:23.247 --> 01:30:25.738
- You take her over my dead body!
- Great. I got the bus right here.

01:30:25.816 --> 01:30:29.274
- I don't care. Come on.
- Don't threaten me.
We're talking about right and wrong!

01:30:29.353 --> 01:30:32.413
- Look, you watch it, mortal.
- I can't believe you.

01:30:32.490 --> 01:30:35.687
You've got eternity on your hands,
she's asking for five lousy minutes.

01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:39.196
- I find it hard to believe
you can't find five minutes.
- I don't have the authority.

01:30:39.263 --> 01:30:42.960
- Authority for what?
- I can't just change everything.
How do you think I can do that?

01:30:43.034 --> 01:30:47.903
- Be creative. Stall.
- Stall?

01:30:47.972 --> 01:30:49.997
Stall Him?

01:30:52.677 --> 01:30:54.941
- What?
- He's probably got a wife and kids.

01:30:55.012 --> 01:30:57.947
I don't wanna...
I-I don't wanna cause a problem.

01:30:58.015 --> 01:31:01.212
Come on. He'd still wanna know
that you cared about him.

01:31:01.285 --> 01:31:03.310
He'd wanna know
that you loved him.

01:31:03.387 --> 01:31:06.879
What if he's
forgotten all about me?

01:31:06.958 --> 01:31:11.258
- Julia, no one could forget about you.
- [Door Opening]

01:31:11.329 --> 01:31:14.127
Can I help you?

01:31:14.198 --> 01:31:16.928
My name's Thomas Reilly and I have
a personal letter for John McBride.

01:31:17.001 --> 01:31:20.767
Oh, well... I bought this place
from him seven years ago.

01:31:20.838 --> 01:31:23.739
- Do you know where he is now?
- Sorry to have to say it,

01:31:23.808 --> 01:31:29.303
- but he died
soon after he sold it to me.
- [Thunder Rumbling]

01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:31.507
Are you sure?

01:31:31.582 --> 01:31:33.846
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm sure about that.

01:31:33.918 --> 01:31:37.752
He wasn't well. I guess things
were kinda rough on him.

01:31:37.822 --> 01:31:40.757
This place was kinda
falling apart when I got it.

01:31:40.825 --> 01:31:44.556
Anyway, he moved down to San Leandro
and rented a little apartment.

01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:46.927
Well...
that's where they found him.

01:31:46.998 --> 01:31:51.662
Oh. I, uh...

01:31:51.736 --> 01:31:54.398
- Thanks.
- Sorry.

01:31:57.475 --> 01:32:00.376
[Thunder Rumbling]

01:32:11.622 --> 01:32:14.489
- The rotor. Maybe it's the rotor.
- [Thomas] Hey!

01:32:14.558 --> 01:32:18.289
- What is this crap?
- What? I beg your pardon?

01:32:18.362 --> 01:32:21.490
- It didn't work!
She can't fix anything!
- Go on.

01:32:21.565 --> 01:32:23.692
- It always works.
- No!

01:32:23.768 --> 01:32:27.169
It might seem like these things
are going down to the wire,

01:32:27.238 --> 01:32:29.172
- Wrong!
- But they always work out.

01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:33.142
The guy's dead, all right!
He's been dead for seven years!

01:32:33.210 --> 01:32:36.873
- But... That, that can't be.
- What to you mean, that can't be?

01:32:36.947 --> 01:32:40.246
No, you know what?
Or he had to be the wrong guy.

01:32:40.318 --> 01:32:43.651
No, it's not the wrong guy!
It's not the wrong guy, you idiot!

01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:45.655
- How can it be the wrong guy?
- I don't know.

01:32:45.823 --> 01:32:49.020
Thomas.

01:32:49.093 --> 01:32:51.527
It's you.

01:32:55.866 --> 01:32:59.302
- What's me?
- You and Anne.

01:33:00.971 --> 01:33:04.429
- That's what I'm supposed to do.
- Meaning?

01:33:04.508 --> 01:33:08.569
I made the same mistake with John
that you're making with Anne.

01:33:08.646 --> 01:33:12.412
I pushed him away, kept him at arms
length and finally, he just left.

01:33:12.483 --> 01:33:15.782
Only you've got the chance
to fix it.

01:33:15.853 --> 01:33:18.754
No. See, Julia,
th-this isn't about me.

01:33:18.823 --> 01:33:21.986
Yes, it is.

01:33:22.059 --> 01:33:25.460
I've watched you
all these years.

01:33:25.529 --> 01:33:28.896
You know how painful it's been
to know who you really are,

01:33:28.966 --> 01:33:33.699
and watch you
keep it hidden from people?

01:33:35.339 --> 01:33:38.240
I don't hide. I protect myself.
I'm cautious.

01:33:38.309 --> 01:33:42.370
You're so afraid of being hurt,
you're gonna end up all alone.

01:33:45.383 --> 01:33:48.750
It doesn't matter
if she says yes or no.

01:33:48.819 --> 01:33:53.483
Don't let her go without telling her
how you really feel.

01:33:53.557 --> 01:33:56.287
Promise me
you're gonna go to her.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:34:01.320
Promise me you're gonna live the life
that I didn't get to live.

01:34:09.173 --> 01:34:11.107
I promise.

01:34:13.444 --> 01:34:15.435
Good.

01:34:19.183 --> 01:34:22.175
I like that.
It has unity.

01:34:22.253 --> 01:34:24.778
I can go now.

01:34:26.991 --> 01:34:31.155
Oh! I wish I could
just give you a big hug.

01:34:39.470 --> 01:34:42.030
Oh, wow.

01:34:50.047 --> 01:34:52.777
[Laughing]

01:35:16.407 --> 01:35:17.669
Thanks.

01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:25.510
[Hal]
I'll be back for you...

01:35:26.917 --> 01:35:30.353
in 50, 60 years.

01:36:28.379 --> 01:36:30.813
I was afraid
you weren't gonna come.

01:36:30.881 --> 01:36:33.281
Well,
I wasn't going to...

01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:37.684
but... it was hard to ignore
the three phone messages,

01:36:37.755 --> 01:36:41.987
the fax, telegram,
homing pigeon.

01:36:44.361 --> 01:36:46.795
I, uh,
I got you this.

01:37:07.384 --> 01:37:10.683
I've loved people before
and they went away.

01:37:10.754 --> 01:37:15.885
So a long time ago, I made a decision
that I wasn't gonna need anyone anymore.

01:37:15.959 --> 01:37:19.759
I wasted most of my life
that way.

01:37:19.830 --> 01:37:24.494
And I know I'm late
and I know I don't deserve it.

01:37:27.004 --> 01:37:30.804
I need you.

01:37:30.874 --> 01:37:34.640
And I love you.

01:37:34.711 --> 01:37:36.702
I love you.

01:38:46.650 --> 01:38:50.746
Oooh

01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:54.813
Walk, walk, walk, walk

01:38:54.891 --> 01:38:58.418
Oooh

01:38:58.495 --> 01:39:06.664
Walk like a man

01:39:06.736 --> 01:39:08.670
- Bye-aye, baby
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:39:08.738 --> 01:39:10.865
- I don't mean maybe
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:39:10.941 --> 01:39:14.877
- Gonna get along somehow
- Ooh-wa-ooh-wa, ooh-wa-ooh

01:39:14.945 --> 01:39:16.879
- Soon you'll be cryin'
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:39:16.947 --> 01:39:18.881
- On account of all your lyin'
- Ooh-wa-ooh

01:39:18.949 --> 01:39:21.417
Oh, yeah
just look who's laughing now

01:39:21.484 --> 01:39:24.942
I'm gonna walk like a man

01:39:25.021 --> 01:39:26.955
Fast as I can

01:39:27.023 --> 01:39:30.982
Walk like a man
from you

01:39:31.061 --> 01:39:34.997
I'll tell the world
forget about it, girl

01:39:35.065 --> 01:39:39.559
And walk like a man
from you

01:39:39.636 --> 01:39:41.763
Oooh

01:39:48.745 --> 01:39:51.680
Mmmm

01:39:55.785 --> 01:40:00.552
The years
they come and go

01:40:02.959 --> 01:40:07.623
And change will come
I know

01:40:09.366 --> 01:40:12.699
You won't

01:40:12.769 --> 01:40:16.466
Be there

01:40:16.539 --> 01:40:20.031
My heart

01:40:20.110 --> 01:40:24.547
And soul

01:40:24.614 --> 01:40:29.313
Different time and place

01:40:31.621 --> 01:40:37.287
But time cannot erase

01:40:38.662 --> 01:40:43.656
The smile
that lights your face

01:40:45.368 --> 01:40:49.031
As you gaze in mine

01:40:49.105 --> 01:40:52.370
It will always shine

01:40:52.442 --> 01:40:56.538
And you

01:40:56.613 --> 01:41:00.208
Will always be

01:41:00.283 --> 01:41:03.616
An angel making sure I care

01:41:03.687 --> 01:41:07.248
A memory that's always there

01:41:07.324 --> 01:41:14.025
You dreams won't die
They live inside of me

01:41:14.097 --> 01:41:18.056
You know you'll always be

01:41:18.134 --> 01:41:24.664
My heart and soul

01:41:24.741 --> 01:41:28.074
Oooh

01:41:29.446 --> 01:41:35.646
Oooh

01:41:35.719 --> 01:41:41.282
If the years
can make you wise

01:41:42.826 --> 01:41:48.196
Now I finally realize

01:41:49.933 --> 01:41:55.235
That if I just close my eyes

01:41:57.006 --> 01:42:00.669
I can see you there

01:42:00.744 --> 01:42:03.838
And the love we share

01:42:03.913 --> 01:42:08.043
And you

01:42:08.118 --> 01:42:11.747
Will always be

01:42:11.821 --> 01:42:15.188
A dream so real
it cannot die

01:42:15.258 --> 01:42:18.853
The trust and faith
that lets me fly

01:42:18.928 --> 01:42:25.697
A love so strong
it just belongs to me

01:42:25.769 --> 01:42:29.569
You know you'll always be

01:42:29.639 --> 01:42:36.670
My heart and soul

01:42:36.746 --> 01:42:44.016
Oooh

01:42:44.087 --> 01:42:47.614
An angel making sure I care

01:42:47.690 --> 01:42:51.217
A memory that's always there

01:42:51.294 --> 01:42:55.697
You'll always be my heart

01:42:55.765 --> 01:43:00.566
And soul

01:43:00.637 --> 01:43:05.574
Oooh
Yeah, yeah

01:43:18.637 --> 01:43:21.574
