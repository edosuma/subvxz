<i>Previously on Boston Legal…</i>

00:01.730 --> 00:02.550
What are you doing in my law firm?

00:02.590 --> 00:05.160
It's not your firm,
Denny. I'm a senior partner.

00:05.200 --> 00:07.490
You just want to run around,
drop your pants, shoot people.

00:07.530 --> 00:08.590
How's the mad cow coming?

00:08.630 --> 00:12.180
I need you to tread more lightly.

00:12.190 --> 00:14.260
–Well, I could always go back.
–I don't want you to go back.

00:14.300 --> 00:16.079
–Alan, Shirley.
–Lorraine.

00:16.090 --> 00:18.220
She's an old girlfriend.
The town is full of them.

00:18.260 --> 00:21.300
There is something
addictive about this woman.

00:21.310 --> 00:23.980
I thought maybe we could celebrate
by getting dinner tonight?

00:24.020 --> 00:25.730
I wouldn't want it to
be construed as a date.

00:25.770 --> 00:27.590
I've hired another associate.

00:27.630 --> 00:30.680
Alan, Lorraine. Lorraine, Alan.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.550
Never mind “how could you go to boston?”

00:41.590 --> 00:43.390
You should've picked
up on the signals, Ramone,

00:43.430 --> 00:47.230
like when I said, “I'm going to
Boston.” Was that too subtle?

00:47.270 --> 00:48.620
Uh, hold on.

00:48.630 --> 00:50.420
What?
–Sexy.

00:50.430 --> 00:52.710
Old. Keep your voice down, Ramone.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.680
I'm at work— my
new job in Boston,

00:55.690 --> 00:57.330
Boston, Massachusetts.

00:57.340 --> 00:58.290
Whitney.

00:58.300 --> 01:01.360
Hey, Carl. I'm working here now.
You mind?

01:01.370 --> 01:02.060
What?

01:02.070 --> 01:04.019
Ramone has pissed me
off for the last time,

01:04.060 --> 01:06.700
so I'll need an office and an assistant.

01:08.430 --> 01:10.130
Ten-hut!

01:12.870 --> 01:14.100
Fitz.

01:14.110 --> 01:15.510
Denny.

01:15.980 --> 01:17.270
You came home safe.

01:18.140 --> 01:19.922
You made it home safe, man.

01:20.450 --> 01:24.360
So he lied. Think it's the first time
a president lied to get us into a war?

01:24.400 --> 01:27.350
I don't know, Fitz. He just—
he makes it hard to…

01:27.390 --> 01:30.690
win an argument. I keep waiting
for him to do something right.

01:30.730 --> 01:35.380
Well, I guess you can't expect
a leopard to change his stripes.

01:35.390 --> 01:36.590
Spots.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.712
You oughta have those looked at.

01:39.070 --> 01:40.820
So, Fitz, what brings you?

01:40.830 --> 01:44.070
It's not like you to make a
social call during wartime.

01:44.110 --> 01:48.270
Well, it's, um… it's my grandson.

01:48.280 --> 01:49.280
Is he going over?

01:49.320 --> 01:51.540
Oh, God, no. I'd send
him to Canada first.

01:51.580 --> 01:54.590
No, he's, um…

01:54.600 --> 01:56.900
my grandson is gay.

01:58.520 --> 01:59.550
You must be crushed.

01:59.590 --> 02:01.610
Well, it's a disappointment,

02:01.620 --> 02:04.210
but the disappointment is me, Denny.

02:04.220 --> 02:08.114
I'm afraid I… I didn't set a
very good example for the boy.

02:08.330 --> 02:10.419
Oh, you— you've
killed people.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.930
Well, even so.

02:11.940 --> 02:13.260
Um…

02:13.270 --> 02:15.060
I've been a disappointment

02:15.070 --> 02:18.660
because I haven't done a better
job of standing up for gay rights.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.720
You see…

02:20.730 --> 02:22.750
I'm gay.

02:27.140 --> 02:28.710
Very funny.

02:28.720 --> 02:30.530
I'm not joking, Denny.

02:30.540 --> 02:32.310
About a month ago,

02:32.320 --> 02:33.910
I came out, and…

02:33.920 --> 02:36.270
the army says it's gonna boot me.

02:36.280 --> 02:39.140
You're married with, uh… kids.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.020
You've seen me naked in the shower.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.520
I would like this firm to represent me.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.750
You, uh… “gay” gay,

02:47.100 --> 02:48.910
uh… like in
homo— homosexual?

02:48.950 --> 02:51.250
I would like to sue the army.

02:51.260 --> 02:53.580
“Don't ask, don't tell”?

02:53.920 --> 02:55.930
I think we should be allowed to tell.

02:55.970 --> 02:58.180
Uh, uh, “gay” gay?

03:00.080 --> 03:02.060
Uh, “gay” gay?

BOSTON LEGAL
Season 04 Episode 04
Do Tell

03:32.970 --> 03:34.330
Morning, Jerry.

03:35.350 --> 03:36.850
Mm. Morning.

03:38.210 --> 03:39.710
Everything okay?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.110
Fine. You?

03:42.660 --> 03:44.250
Fine, thank you.

03:45.740 --> 03:47.940
Nothing's wrong at all?
–Nope.

03:48.230 --> 03:51.450
Just very busy. Busy
day. Busy, busy day.

03:54.660 --> 03:57.080
Breaking up with him
isn't the hard part.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.360
Staying apart is something different.

03:59.400 --> 04:02.740
So I just figure I need to be
in a different city, far away.

04:02.780 --> 04:04.620
But not too far away.

04:04.630 --> 04:07.030
Just give me a case so
I can distract myself.

04:07.070 --> 04:09.960
Whitney, you can't just waltz
in here and hire yourself.

04:10.000 --> 04:10.880
–Why not?
–Señor Sack!

04:10.920 --> 04:12.000
Because—

04:13.580 --> 04:15.956
Miguel, what an incredible surprise.

04:16.620 --> 04:19.070
It seems you've abducted a small child.

04:19.110 --> 04:20.850
No, no. Este es mi hijo domingo.

04:20.890 --> 04:22.060
Tiene diez años.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.780
Miguel, my spanish hasn't gotten
any better since last we hugged.

04:25.820 --> 04:27.550
Miguel, stop.

04:29.020 --> 04:31.690
He says this is his son
Domingo, 10 years old.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.090
Si, si.

04:33.100 --> 04:33.940
You speak spanish?

04:33.980 --> 04:36.488
I don't speak it. I can understand it.

04:38.990 --> 04:42.040
His ex-wife is trying to
take his son away from him.

04:42.080 --> 04:43.580
She's not mexican.

04:43.970 --> 04:47.600
When he takes Domingo to
Mexico, he competes in sports.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.910
One sport where he
excels as a champion—

04:50.950 --> 04:53.788
Okay, the child is
cutting off circulation.

04:56.650 --> 04:58.850
What, um, sport are we talking about?

04:58.890 --> 05:00.730
Los toros.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.510
–Bullfighting.
–What?

05:02.520 --> 05:05.610
Si, mi hijo— mi hijo
es el matador campeon.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.380
Un torero supremo!

05:07.390 --> 05:10.770
Okay, so this child fights bulls?

05:10.780 --> 05:11.410
Si.

05:11.420 --> 05:14.910
In a ring with a sword
and a cape and <i>ole</i> ?

05:14.920 --> 05:16.630
–Ole!
–Ole!

05:23.350 --> 05:26.400
He's a bullfighter. I
get it. I get it. Stop.

05:29.540 --> 05:31.940
Please… help me.

05:32.850 --> 05:35.620
I'm afraid I can't help you, son.

05:36.030 --> 05:38.620
But don't despair. Whitney can.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.090
No. No.

05:45.530 --> 05:47.170
Distracted enough yet?

05:54.100 --> 05:57.820
My problem is, if I raise a
stink, they might retaliate.

05:57.830 --> 05:59.270
I could be court-martialed.

05:59.310 --> 06:00.520
And yet?

06:00.530 --> 06:01.940
I want to make a stink.

06:01.980 --> 06:04.390
–Court-martial could mean jail, Fitz.
–I know.

06:04.430 --> 06:08.810
In Lawrence vs Texas, the supreme
court struck down boysenberry,

06:08.820 --> 06:11.090
claiming it canonized the squeegee.

06:11.130 --> 06:12.714
That's exactly the pope.

06:16.450 --> 06:18.280
Canker sore.

06:18.970 --> 06:21.790
In addition to striking down
the dreaded canker sores,

06:21.830 --> 06:24.730
I believe the Lawrence court also
squashed the law against sodomy.

06:24.770 --> 06:27.250
They ruled it basically
criminalized gay conduct.

06:27.290 --> 06:31.530
We could argue the “don't ask, don't
tell” policy does the same thing.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.140
Jell-O.

06:44.080 --> 06:47.110
Denny. Any thoughts?

06:47.120 --> 06:48.560
It's between you and God.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.670
You got something to say, say it.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.430
Oh, suddenly we're a fan of honesty?

06:53.440 --> 06:55.890
You don't want to be at my table,
you can walk right out that door.

06:55.930 --> 06:56.960
Hey, my table.

06:56.970 --> 06:57.820
All right.

06:57.830 --> 07:00.470
My door. Don't be telling me what to do.

07:05.170 --> 07:07.730
The truth is, I'm not good
with mexican people, Carl,

07:07.770 --> 07:09.700
especially the bullfighting variety.

07:09.740 --> 07:10.960
You wanted a case.

07:10.970 --> 07:13.030
–Come on, not this one.
–Tough.

07:13.040 --> 07:16.050
Katie. How are we today?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.280
Feels a bit like a trick
question, I must say.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.070
This is Whitney Rome. She's
joining us as a new associate.

07:21.110 --> 07:23.150
And she has a child custody case,

07:23.190 --> 07:25.720
as do you now. Play nice.

07:26.350 --> 07:27.870
I need an office.

07:29.130 --> 07:30.980
Hello. Welcome.

07:31.580 --> 07:34.220
Yeah, I'm not feeling a connection here.

07:45.270 --> 07:47.052
Everything all right, Alan?

07:47.430 --> 07:49.420
Guadalupe.

07:49.430 --> 07:52.400
You still get afflicted
by word salad, I see.

07:53.250 --> 07:56.990
As I remember, it's
brought on by anxiety.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.720
I'm no psychologist,

07:58.760 --> 08:02.350
but I believe the best way to
relieve anxiety is to talk about it.

08:02.390 --> 08:04.600
Do we know the cause, Alan?

08:07.250 --> 08:11.470
I… mm…

08:12.540 --> 08:16.010
hate…

08:18.200 --> 08:21.740
to… disappoint,

08:21.750 --> 08:24.250
but…

08:24.260 --> 08:27.560
whatever affect you have
on me isn't neurological.

08:29.580 --> 08:33.020
I see your lips can certainly
form the words properly.

08:33.059 --> 08:38.274
And that tongue of yours easily wraps
around the most challenging of syllables.

08:38.390 --> 08:39.980
I think it's my favorite
part of that tongue,

08:40.020 --> 08:43.700
actually, the way it wraps around…

08:44.890 --> 08:46.670
syllables.

08:47.190 --> 08:48.860
Nice try!

08:49.220 --> 08:53.900
But I have noticed you've completely
lost the art of kissing softly.

08:55.250 --> 08:58.550
Does it trouble you not
to be able to kiss softly?

09:13.450 --> 09:15.040
Seems I'm wrong.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.650
Seems so.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.900
Well, well, well.

09:27.910 --> 09:29.430
Thank you, Alan,

09:29.440 --> 09:32.940
for welcoming the new
employees with such open arms.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.050
I just made another hire.

09:36.090 --> 09:41.172
Wondering if I might ask Clarence to
give her some administrative assistance.

09:42.010 --> 09:43.600
Coleslaw.

09:51.550 --> 09:52.660
All rise.

09:52.670 --> 09:54.820
–Oh, great.
–What?

09:54.830 --> 09:56.700
Not the judge we want.

09:56.710 --> 10:00.010
This court is in session. The
honorable judge Clark Brown is sitting.

10:00.050 --> 10:02.954
God bless the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

10:05.550 --> 10:07.360
How dare you?

10:07.370 --> 10:12.060
How dare you sue the United
States military in a time of war?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.320
I find this shocking.

10:14.330 --> 10:17.640
Yes, notwithstanding that
little nugget of objectivity,

10:17.680 --> 10:22.498
might you consider recusing yourself
on the grounds that you're in shock?

10:24.240 --> 10:27.936
First of all, this case
doesn't belong in a state court.

10:28.170 --> 10:30.190
It's a question of federal jurisdiction.

10:30.230 --> 10:33.380
And second, it doesn't
belong there either.

10:33.780 --> 10:36.660
How well do you think
this war would go, counsel,

10:36.700 --> 10:39.340
if every gay soldier decided to sue?

10:39.350 --> 10:42.650
Uh, I let me guess. Less
well than it's going now?

10:43.430 --> 10:48.470
Your honor, other gay soldiers are not
likely to sue since by coming forward,

10:48.510 --> 10:50.610
they'd also be coming
out in the process,

10:50.650 --> 10:54.280
possibly face dishonorable
discharge or even court-martial.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.800
And as for jurisdiction, you are
right, we do belong in federal court,

10:57.840 --> 10:59.028
but let's face it,

10:59.030 --> 11:01.740
all the judges there
are federal appointees

11:01.780 --> 11:03.830
and most of them are looking to move up,

11:03.870 --> 11:07.780
and that'll never happen if they do anything
other than kick this case on its face.

11:07.820 --> 11:12.410
We stand a much better chance of
getting a fair hearing from a fair,

11:12.420 --> 11:16.980
impartial, open-minded state
court judge, like yourself.

11:16.990 --> 11:20.130
But given
your own—

11:20.680 --> 11:22.600
oh, let's call
it baggage—

11:22.610 --> 11:25.180
perhaps you should
hand this ball off.

11:25.900 --> 11:27.390
Why?

11:27.880 --> 11:29.660
Okay.

11:29.970 --> 11:32.750
You once sued a religious institution

11:32.760 --> 11:36.870
because it failed to cure
you of your homosexuality.

11:37.790 --> 11:43.070
I am not now nor have I ever been
a member of the homosexual party.

11:43.080 --> 11:45.020
I admitted to having…

11:45.030 --> 11:49.750
isolated, abhorrent, unnatural… urges.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.790
I'll have you know I no longer do.

11:51.830 --> 11:54.750
Oh, great. So you are cured.

11:54.760 --> 11:58.580
I find card-carrying heterosexuals
with histories of abhorrent,

11:58.620 --> 12:02.520
unnatural urges to be least
flexible on military issues.

12:02.530 --> 12:04.510
I shall hear this case.

12:04.520 --> 12:05.760
What?

12:05.770 --> 12:07.790
I I thought you were
simply going to dismiss it.

12:07.830 --> 12:11.260
Denied! I'm capable of
presiding here, and I shall.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.790
Call your first witness.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.520
Terrific.

12:17.990 --> 12:21.290
We're winning so far… sort of.

12:31.250 --> 12:36.780
Can you possibly imagine letting your
10-year-old child do battle with a 600-pound bull?

12:36.820 --> 12:38.440
It's awful.

12:40.970 --> 12:44.580
Jerry… I feel some
estrangement between you and I.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.020
It's upsetting.

12:47.900 --> 12:49.748
Could you look at me, Jerry?

12:53.480 --> 12:55.922
Without the wooden cigarette, please.

13:04.400 --> 13:09.416
When you asked me to dinner as colleagues,
were you asking me out on a date?

13:10.800 --> 13:13.506
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

13:14.020 --> 13:18.442
However our relationship evolves,
I pray it's always an honest one.

13:19.380 --> 13:22.020
Were you asking me out
on a date, Jerry?

13:25.960 --> 13:27.610
Yes.

13:27.620 --> 13:29.450
I'm enormously flattered by that.

13:29.490 --> 13:32.090
It's a lucky woman who gets
to be involved with you.

13:32.130 --> 13:34.370
And you don't feel nearly so lucky.

13:34.410 --> 13:36.000
I've known you less than a month,

13:36.040 --> 13:39.870
and I already feel that you and I could
grow into the very best of friends,

13:39.910 --> 13:44.134
a friendship that runs deeper
than any've ever had with a lover.

13:44.940 --> 13:47.630
Katie, it was wrong of me
even to ask.

13:47.640 --> 13:51.130
No, it wasn't. You took a chance
with the noblest of motives.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.050
You should feel anything
but embarrassed.

13:53.090 --> 13:56.960
Aside from being one of the kindest and
most intelligent men I've ever encountered,

13:57.000 --> 14:02.016
I now know you to be a person with
impeccably good taste and high standards.

14:04.780 --> 14:07.850
Promise me you won't stop
being my friend, Jerry.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.510
I could never.

14:24.090 --> 14:26.230
As of the year 2005,

14:26.240 --> 14:31.220
more than 10,000 people were discharged
by the US military for homosexuality.

14:31.260 --> 14:33.100
10,000?

14:33.110 --> 14:37.620
At a replacement cost of $364 million.

14:37.630 --> 14:42.180
This at a time when recruitment standards
have been lowered to include the people

14:42.220 --> 14:45.450
who have criminal backgrounds and
people who have medical issues.

14:45.490 --> 14:47.320
Does that make sense?

14:47.330 --> 14:50.730
May I ask, have you always
known that you were gay?

14:50.740 --> 14:53.270
Well, I denied it to myself.

14:53.280 --> 14:57.680
That's what my generation did.
We married, we had kids, denied.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.810
But I'd have to say, yes,

14:59.820 --> 15:01.040
I've always known it.

15:01.080 --> 15:03.910
So for 30 years of military service,

15:03.920 --> 15:06.780
during which time you won
all of those pretty ribbons…

15:06.820 --> 15:09.850
I was homosexual. I was
queer, light in the loafers.

15:09.890 --> 15:11.550
–Objection.
–Sustained.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.730
You have to hide that part.

15:15.190 --> 15:19.300
You have to change pronouns when
people ask you about relationships.

15:19.340 --> 15:22.130
“He” becomes “she.”

15:22.140 --> 15:24.850
“Don't ask, don't tell”
was a compromise.

15:24.860 --> 15:27.890
It was supposed to allow gays
to serve without witch hunts.

15:27.930 --> 15:29.610
Instead it's…

15:29.620 --> 15:31.900
institutionalized prejudice.

15:32.640 --> 15:35.478
Did you, as a general,
enforce this policy?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.200
I'm ashamed to admit I did.

15:37.240 --> 15:40.090
In fact, you yourself discharged
soldiers because they were gay.

15:40.130 --> 15:42.270
Because they were openly gay, yes.

15:42.310 --> 15:44.400
And now when you get
fired, you want to sue.

15:44.440 --> 15:45.540
Yes.

15:45.550 --> 15:47.464
–You still married, sir?
–No.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.600
She left after you
announced you were a gay.

15:50.640 --> 15:51.540
Yes.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.960
–Did you sue her?
–Objection.

15:53.000 --> 15:57.460
A personal relationship in
part based on sexual attraction

15:57.470 --> 16:00.670
is obviously skewed
by sexual orientation.

16:01.280 --> 16:04.730
My job performance as a general is not.

16:30.310 --> 16:31.640
You've gotta be kidding.

16:31.680 --> 16:36.120
Your honor, the tape clearly proves
the young man was never in danger.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.410
Never in danger?

16:37.420 --> 16:40.390
He was being charged
by a 500-pound bull.

16:40.400 --> 16:43.670
Kids engage in dangerous
sporting activities all the time.

16:43.710 --> 16:47.760
10 year olds race down the side
of mountains at breakneck speeds.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.080
We let them play football, where
they smash all kinds of bones.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.628
And let's not even
discuss ice hockey.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.000
I think they bite.

16:56.690 --> 16:57.850
I could be wrong.

16:57.860 --> 17:00.600
Letting them play with bulls
seems to cross the line.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.670
According to our
customs, but not Mexico's.

17:04.079 --> 17:05.819
I'd like to hear from the boy.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.740
Fine, talk to him,

17:07.750 --> 17:10.430
but there's a reason why he's
sitting next to his father on this.

17:10.470 --> 17:13.589
I'd like to hear from him
in my chambers, please.

17:13.630 --> 17:16.910
I want to be satisfied
that he is not under

17:16.920 --> 17:20.800
anybody's influence or
control while he's answering.

17:20.810 --> 17:23.470
Would that be okay
with you, counsel?

17:24.430 --> 17:28.521
Why is she picking on me? You
see a big target on my forehead?

17:28.590 --> 17:30.070
Yes, ma'am.

17:30.460 --> 17:31.600
Word salad?

17:32.470 --> 17:33.620
I thought I was over it.

17:33.660 --> 17:37.080
Well, we never really know
ourselves, Alan, or our friends.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.480
We think we do but…

17:40.210 --> 17:42.710
Well, I don't know this Fitz,

17:42.720 --> 17:45.760
but, Denny, think of the
discrimination gays face.

17:45.800 --> 17:50.880
We've got senators running around proposing
constitutional amendments that prevent them

17:50.920 --> 17:54.510
from enjoying the same
freedoms heterosexuals have,

17:54.520 --> 17:57.360
never mind the proliferation of hate
crimes where they're routinely beaten up,

17:57.400 --> 18:00.810
and multiply that bigotry
times 10, times 50—

18:00.820 --> 18:03.922
that's what Fitz faced
while he was growing up.

18:04.700 --> 18:06.290
Gibberish.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.280
Sorry?

18:07.290 --> 18:09.120
You're not speaking gibberish.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.920
It only seems to come on
when Lorraine comes around,

18:11.960 --> 18:14.260
which happens to be now, by the way.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.460
Hello.

18:17.490 --> 18:19.410
Nipple.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.920
Break-dance.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.650
Want to play elevator?

18:30.990 --> 18:32.580
Whatever.

18:38.060 --> 18:40.240
General Fitzgerald's career
has been one of distinction.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.930
He was awarded the purple heart and
the bronze star, the soldier's medal.

18:43.970 --> 18:47.450
He's received 11 decorations,
including the Legion of Merit.

18:47.490 --> 18:49.060
He was a soldier's soldier.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.300
Until he was tragically
struck down with gayness.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.250
–Objection.
–Sustained.

18:53.260 --> 18:57.470
He can be dismissed pursuant to the
1994 national defense authorization act.

18:57.510 --> 18:59.030
–“Don't ask, don't tell.”
–Yes.

18:59.070 --> 19:05.160
Which says that gays can only serve
in the military as long as they keep
their sexual orientation private.

19:05.200 --> 19:05.980
Yes.

19:05.990 --> 19:08.670
And General Fitzgerald's offense was?

19:08.680 --> 19:10.360
He told.

19:10.890 --> 19:11.630
Thank you.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.930
Oh, uh, congratulations, Ms Schmidt.

19:13.970 --> 19:18.790
Why, you've just taken up an hour
of the court's time— of my time—

19:18.800 --> 19:24.240
to establish something that was stipulated to
by both sides from the very beginning.

19:24.280 --> 19:27.900
You know, you're really
taking the fun out of this.

19:34.430 --> 19:36.550
These are veronicas.

19:40.400 --> 19:43.260
And you end with a media-veronica.

19:46.150 --> 19:47.770
That's very impressive.

19:48.850 --> 19:51.780
Sometimes you begin
with a farol de rodillas.

19:51.820 --> 19:54.950
The bull enters the
ring, he charges this way,

19:54.960 --> 19:57.390
he's coming, and then…

20:01.490 --> 20:04.360
Domingo, do you ever get
scared when you're in there?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.640
Sometimes, but I love it.

20:06.650 --> 20:09.700
I've tried other sports—
football, baseball—

20:09.710 --> 20:12.620
this is the only one
I love, and I'm good.

20:12.630 --> 20:17.930
Again, your honor, I would urge
you not to impose our culture on—

20:17.940 --> 20:19.300
Counsel.

20:19.650 --> 20:22.830
I don't really see this as
a culture war, but thank you.

20:22.870 --> 20:24.510
You're a sage.

20:25.010 --> 20:26.870
Okay, that's not picking on me?

20:26.910 --> 20:28.980
I'd like to hear from the father.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.320
What about me?

20:30.330 --> 20:34.270
Ms Obisbo, as a mother, I totally
know where you're coming from.

20:34.310 --> 20:37.980
Dad needs to step into the
witness chair, tomorrow.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.540
You don't just hire people
unilaterally, Carl. We have—

20:46.580 --> 20:47.400
She hired herself. I just—

20:47.440 --> 20:48.470
You signed off without any—

20:48.510 --> 20:50.270
Whitney Rome is a blue-chip attorney.

20:50.310 --> 20:52.050
That is not the point.

20:52.060 --> 20:54.890
What is, Shirley? You brought me
in here to help run litigation.

20:54.930 --> 20:56.280
I made an executive decision.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.720
You subordinated me. I don't
like being subordinated.

20:59.760 --> 21:02.320
It's not what true partners do.

21:02.710 --> 21:05.270
We still… talking professionally?

21:05.280 --> 21:10.626
Well, of course we're talking professionally.
What else would I be talking about?

21:12.250 --> 21:14.370
Shirley, ever since I
suggested we move in together,

21:14.410 --> 21:17.970
you've gone Donald Rumsfeld
on me, minus the charm.

21:20.120 --> 21:23.430
You didn't “suggest”
we move in together.

21:23.440 --> 21:27.300
You suggested I move in to your place.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.010
–Aaaah.
–I don't like being aaahed.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.780
You know what your problem is?

21:34.820 --> 21:36.300
I thought I was perfect.

21:36.340 --> 21:38.060
Besides that.

21:38.650 --> 21:42.660
You've controlled every
man you've ever been with.

21:42.670 --> 21:46.610
You said yourself, they've always made
you feel like their mother at times.

21:46.650 --> 21:51.640
And yet, the idea of you being
controlled— heaven forbid— subordinated?

21:52.470 --> 21:53.988
Is that what you think?

21:55.500 --> 21:57.190
I think…

21:57.200 --> 22:00.434
you are the most beautiful
woman I've ever known.

22:01.890 --> 22:05.060
And I want to live together, wherever.

22:05.590 --> 22:08.890
And if you get mommy pangs,
I'll let you spank me.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.170
Denny…

22:19.180 --> 22:21.950
we were just…

22:26.590 --> 22:28.620
Just…

22:36.910 --> 22:38.630
Not good.

22:41.880 --> 22:44.590
Denny, the thing about shooting
him is you'll go to jail.

22:44.630 --> 22:46.260
I don't care.

22:46.270 --> 22:48.230
There's nothing on the
outside for me anymore.

22:48.270 --> 22:50.270
You don't mean that.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.570
I thought she still loved me.

22:52.580 --> 22:54.160
She doesn't.

22:54.170 --> 22:55.430
Maybe Fitz does.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.130
Not funny.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.836
Shirley's the one for me,
Alan. She's the one.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.820
Humperdinck.

23:05.830 --> 23:07.890
I doubt if she'd let me.

23:17.590 --> 23:19.768
I didn't want him to fight bulls.

23:19.910 --> 23:22.360
I tried to encourage
him to play other sports.

23:22.400 --> 23:23.970
Such as?

23:26.060 --> 23:27.644
I got him a soccer ball.

23:28.420 --> 23:32.460
But he glued horns on it and
stabbed it with a toy sword.

23:33.740 --> 23:37.520
It was the same with baseball,
basketball, everything.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.980
He only wants to fight the bulls.

23:40.020 --> 23:45.102
But children want to do a lot of things
that aren't good for them, Mr Obisbo.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.272
Bullfighting is a
tradition in my country.

23:48.490 --> 23:51.064
I would have done it
if I had the gift.

23:51.720 --> 23:55.310
To climb in with that big bull stallion,

23:55.320 --> 23:57.930
to have that big bull charge me…

23:57.940 --> 24:01.730
just me and that stallion bull,

24:01.740 --> 24:04.550
one time— me…

24:04.560 --> 24:07.340
and a big, horny bull.

24:18.740 --> 24:20.480
God forgive me.

24:24.350 --> 24:28.790
“Don't ask, don't tell” is a very considered
and thought-out policy, your honor.

24:28.830 --> 24:32.200
One hatched not by Dick Cheney
or Karl Rove, by the way,

24:32.240 --> 24:34.230
but by the Clinton administration.

24:34.270 --> 24:37.570
It doesn't target gays. It
doesn't say you can't be gay.

24:37.610 --> 24:40.080
Just don't be open and notorious.

24:40.090 --> 24:44.590
We do not need our military compro‐
mised by unnecessary distractions.

24:44.630 --> 24:48.250
And also, let's face it, the
army is concerned with image.

24:48.290 --> 24:49.330
It has to be.

24:49.340 --> 24:52.290
The rough-and-tumble
soldiers, ready to do battle;

24:52.330 --> 24:57.390
we seek to strike awe— and yes, a little
fear— into the hearts of our enemy.

24:57.400 --> 25:00.390
So we have “don't ask, don't tell.”

25:00.400 --> 25:03.730
Do we change this one
day? I don't know. Maybe.

25:03.740 --> 25:05.970
But now? As a practical matter,

25:05.980 --> 25:10.930
you do not challenge or change
military policy during a time of war.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.510
You just don't.

25:14.230 --> 25:18.050
Yes, that works out to be extremely
practical for our presidential candidates

25:18.090 --> 25:20.190
who don't want to go near the issue.

25:20.230 --> 25:24.410
I was watching a debate— there were at
least 12 candidates standing on stage—

25:24.450 --> 25:28.260
not one dared challenge
“don't ask, don't tell.”

25:28.270 --> 25:32.960
I guess politicians feel bigotry can be
ratified by a 59% approval rating,

25:33.000 --> 25:36.640
but whether your name is
Hillary, Obama, Rudy, Mitt,

25:36.650 --> 25:39.390
their message is all the same—
“you want to be gay,

25:39.430 --> 25:43.080
fine. But for God's sake,
keep it to yourself.”

25:43.090 --> 25:45.180
Aren't we a proud people?

25:45.190 --> 25:49.140
Thank God for America,
holding out for real values,

25:49.150 --> 25:54.980
while Canada, England, Australia,
Israel welcome gays into their military.

25:54.990 --> 26:00.750
In fact, every member of NATO, with the exception
of Turkey, say it's okay to be gay and in uniform.

26:00.790 --> 26:02.190
But what do they know?

26:02.230 --> 26:06.130
If you're going to impose
democracy across the world,

26:06.140 --> 26:09.300
you've got to take a stand
against civil liberties.

26:09.340 --> 26:12.510
I will not allow you to attack
the United States of America.

26:12.550 --> 26:13.730
Why the hell not?

26:13.740 --> 26:16.440
On this issue, we've taken
the decidedly low road.

26:16.480 --> 26:21.100
We're not only tolerating intolerance,
we're codifying it into national policy.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.550
How can we all not be ashamed?

26:23.560 --> 26:25.560
Not everyone shares your point of view.

26:25.600 --> 26:26.920
Clearly.

26:26.930 --> 26:29.600
In fact, it's quite a popular prejudice.

26:29.610 --> 26:32.260
We don't allow gays to marry, we
don't allow them to give blood,

26:32.300 --> 26:34.960
we make it next to impossible
for them to get health insurance,

26:35.000 --> 26:38.920
and how about the big national
tribute to Jerry Falwell,

26:38.930 --> 26:43.020
the man who blamed 9/11 on
God's wrath against homosexuals?

26:43.030 --> 26:45.850
We give him a state funeral,
like he's a national hero?

26:45.890 --> 26:49.380
This case is not about Jerry Falwell.

26:49.390 --> 26:52.230
It's not about discrimination
against gays in America.

26:52.270 --> 26:55.730
It is about gays in the military,

26:55.740 --> 26:59.436
a practical analysis in time
of war, and I will ask you…

26:59.640 --> 27:02.180
to keep your remarks on point.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.210
Okay.

27:08.870 --> 27:10.920
Practically speaking,

27:10.930 --> 27:12.600
this war isn't going well.

27:12.640 --> 27:15.750
We keep saying we need
to send in more troops.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.100
Well, judge, there are no more troops.

27:18.140 --> 27:20.030
We've run through the national guard.

27:20.070 --> 27:22.460
We're now tapping into
private security companies.

27:22.500 --> 27:25.300
There are no more troops.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.690
As a practical matter,

27:26.730 --> 27:31.410
we have thrown 10,000 good soldiers
out because they admitted being gay.

27:31.450 --> 27:34.650
Do you know how desperately
the army could use those men?

27:34.690 --> 27:37.700
As a practical matter,
this policy stinks.

27:37.710 --> 27:42.290
As a moral one, I repeat, how can
every one of us not be ashamed?

27:42.300 --> 27:45.650
And why the hell aren't you?

28:22.570 --> 28:24.540
You didn't come to court.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.648
I didn't feel like being a prop today.

28:31.440 --> 28:34.510
Denny, you and I…
do you really think—

28:34.520 --> 28:37.540
My loins still hunger for you.

28:38.430 --> 28:41.380
I felt yours were still hot for me.

28:41.770 --> 28:44.300
My loins cooled off in the '80s.

28:44.310 --> 28:47.480
So you jump in the sack
with… Sack?

28:51.760 --> 28:53.340
Do you love him?

28:54.460 --> 28:55.990
I think I do.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.470
Do you love me?

29:00.330 --> 29:02.320
I'll always love you.

29:03.360 --> 29:05.590
But not that way.

29:06.420 --> 29:10.430
I could be wrong, but you seem to
have no trouble feeding your loins.

29:10.470 --> 29:13.572
I love you, Shirley. I'm
not ashamed to say it.

29:15.730 --> 29:17.870
If you love me…

29:17.880 --> 29:20.600
then you'll want me
to be happy,

29:20.610 --> 29:23.070
even if I'm not with you.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.270
I don't love you that much.

29:27.820 --> 29:29.540
Good night.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.310
Uh, Shirley.

29:35.820 --> 29:40.580
If you are happy…
I'm glad. I really am.

29:41.350 --> 29:42.510
Thank you.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.020
I've— I've always
wanted your happiness.

29:52.190 --> 29:53.360
Damn it! Denny!

29:53.370 --> 29:54.480
I want you to be happy.

29:54.520 --> 29:57.380
Oh, g—
good night.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.300
This boy is 10 years old.

30:14.310 --> 30:16.590
The physical danger speaks for itself.

30:16.630 --> 30:18.800
Any time that Domingo is in the ring,

30:18.840 --> 30:21.670
he's always only an
instant away from death.

30:21.710 --> 30:24.100
Moreover, you should
also consider this—

30:24.140 --> 30:26.660
what kind of person is
Domingo becoming?

30:26.700 --> 30:28.710
Where is the moral center
of a child

30:28.750 --> 30:32.920
who is taught that torturing and
slaughtering an animal is all right?

30:32.960 --> 30:36.400
Best interest of the child,
that's your criterion.

30:36.410 --> 30:39.190
His best interests
simply cannot be served

30:39.200 --> 30:42.390
if he's allowed to engage
in a sport where winning

30:42.430 --> 30:44.550
means torturing an innocent animal

30:44.590 --> 30:49.500
and losing means either
catastrophic injury or death.

31:00.020 --> 31:01.770
Good morning, your honor.

31:01.780 --> 31:04.230
Horrible business, this bullfighting.

31:04.240 --> 31:08.330
It's a wonder that serious injuries
are relatively rare, which they are.

31:08.370 --> 31:12.520
We have more catastrophic injuries
in this country from cheerleading.

31:12.560 --> 31:15.490
In football —the
american version—

31:15.500 --> 31:18.160
there are 300,000 concussions each year,

31:18.170 --> 31:20.860
and that's just measuring high
school and college students.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.840
Studies now link these
concussions to lifelong depression.

31:23.880 --> 31:25.570
I suppose we should ban football.

31:25.610 --> 31:27.330
But, of course, we never will.

31:27.370 --> 31:31.020
It's part of american
culture, as are firearms.

31:31.030 --> 31:33.880
There are more guns in
american households than pets.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.510
I must say, I don't
quite fathom that one.

31:35.550 --> 31:37.980
But America began with a
shot heard round the world,

31:38.020 --> 31:41.300
so I suppose guns are
simply part of its fabric.

31:41.880 --> 31:45.460
In Mexico, bullfighting
is part of the fabric.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.910
It may seem barbaric to
Ms Zale or you or me,

31:48.920 --> 31:52.830
but the European Union did declare
bullfighting to be a protected activity

31:52.870 --> 31:56.480
because it is part of the national
culture of certain countries.

31:56.520 --> 31:59.440
Goya and Picasso have
painted bullfights.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.690
Lorca and Hemingway
have written about them.

32:01.730 --> 32:03.830
Bizet's “Carmen” involves a bullfighter.

32:03.870 --> 32:05.450
Almodovar's movies have dealt with them.

32:05.490 --> 32:08.100
It's considered by many to be an art.

32:08.410 --> 32:11.560
And Domingo is very, very good at it.

32:11.570 --> 32:13.400
I must say, as
a mother—

32:13.410 --> 32:15.880
But your not this boy's
mother, your honor.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.920
She is.

32:16.930 --> 32:18.690
Yes, and if you rule
in her favor,

32:18.730 --> 32:21.220
what's to stop the next
mother from challenging custody

32:21.260 --> 32:23.680
because Dad takes Johnny rock climbing

32:23.720 --> 32:26.540
or hang gliding or
hunting or bull riding,

32:26.550 --> 32:30.120
as they do in the west.
Sports can be dangerous.

32:30.130 --> 32:34.330
The key is proper training, as
Domingo has most certainly had here.

32:34.370 --> 32:40.460
There's no evidence to suggest that
Miguel Obisbo has been anything other
than a fit and loving father.

32:40.500 --> 32:44.760
Courts have never decided custody based
on the sports that children engage in.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.390
Do you really mean
to open that door?

32:46.430 --> 32:50.390
If the sport is barbaric and
lethal, I don't have a problem.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.500
This isn't Mexico, counsel.

32:53.510 --> 32:55.290
This is America.

32:55.300 --> 32:57.920
I bring my own values
to the plate.

32:57.930 --> 33:00.810
Yes, I come from England.

33:01.140 --> 33:03.960
There was a time when the
whole world belonged to us.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.750
It took a while for us to make peace
with the idea that it didn't anymore,

33:06.790 --> 33:09.240
and probably never did.

33:10.140 --> 33:14.730
Lovely idea, I suppose, the thought of
imposing one's culture all over the globe.

33:14.770 --> 33:17.280
I think the world once
belonged to America, too.

33:17.320 --> 33:19.320
Or so you thought.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.720
It really doesn't.

33:30.290 --> 33:33.730
When did the world
ever belong to England?

33:35.960 --> 33:39.620
Denny, you can't just run off to Nimmo
bay every time you get your heart broken.

33:39.660 --> 33:42.900
Why not? I can't have Shirley,
I'll settle for a big fat chinook.

33:42.940 --> 33:45.260
And by the way,
I asked to hump her dink,

33:45.300 --> 33:47.710
and she said she didn't know
what the hell I was talking about.

33:47.750 --> 33:49.780
Neither did I, quite frankly.

33:49.790 --> 33:52.020
Denny—

33:53.260 --> 33:54.700
I'll get my waders.

33:54.710 --> 33:57.050
May I talk to you? It's important.

33:58.950 --> 34:01.700
Anything you have to say to me,
you can say in front of Denny.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.960
We're married.

34:02.970 --> 34:04.370
Fine, then.

34:07.590 --> 34:08.989
Sit.

34:12.120 --> 34:13.870
What's going on?

34:14.920 --> 34:18.400
She said she wanted to talk.
That question requires me to.

34:18.440 --> 34:21.540
Why have I occasioned the
relapse into word salad?

34:21.580 --> 34:24.020
You haven't. Spinach.

34:24.030 --> 34:26.010
Clearly I make you uncomfortable.

34:26.050 --> 34:29.900
You profess I even cause you to act
involuntarily, though I remain unconvinced,

34:29.940 --> 34:32.650
and now the disorganized
speech patterns. What is it?

34:32.690 --> 34:34.750
And don't say you don't
know. I suspect you do.

34:34.790 --> 34:36.770
Oh, she's very strict.

34:36.780 --> 34:39.250
I'd appreciate you
staying out of this, Denny.

34:39.290 --> 34:40.659
Alan?

34:42.600 --> 34:44.170
It's not you.

34:57.420 --> 34:59.380
As one penis said to the other,

34:59.420 --> 35:01.400
“you can just call me chubby.”

35:05.260 --> 35:07.000
All rise.

35:07.440 --> 35:08.840
This court is in session.

35:08.880 --> 35:11.256
The honorable judge Brown presiding.

35:13.110 --> 35:15.220
My God. He got a bigger gavel.

35:18.780 --> 35:22.930
I find the demeanor of Ms
Schmidt to be disgusting.

35:23.330 --> 35:25.960
Attacking my country…

35:26.630 --> 35:30.490
We, Americans, do not get ashamed.

35:31.880 --> 35:33.660
But I must admit,

35:33.670 --> 35:36.950
there is no defensible rationale
for “don't ask, don't tell.”

35:36.990 --> 35:41.650
There is no evidence that gay soldiers
might distract the heterosexual ones.

35:41.690 --> 35:47.140
This isn't a bigotry supported
by any real pragmatic concerns.

35:47.520 --> 35:50.310
This is 2007,

35:50.320 --> 35:55.520
and we are still telling people that they
don't have the right to be who they really are?

35:55.560 --> 35:59.520
It's shocking…
disgusting… abominable.

36:00.100 --> 36:01.660
He threw in a new word.

36:01.670 --> 36:03.410
I rule in fairness.

36:05.050 --> 36:09.930
This man— this man has served
for 30 years— 30 years—

36:09.940 --> 36:13.360
on tours of duty in Bosnia and Iraq.

36:13.370 --> 36:15.420
He's been awarded almost
every medal of distinction,

36:15.460 --> 36:19.110
and he's going to be
tossed because he's gay?

36:21.460 --> 36:25.020
I hereby enjoin that discharge,

36:25.030 --> 36:33.110
and I order the United States army
to leave this fine soldier… alone.

36:35.230 --> 36:36.640
Adjourned.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.460
Congratulations.

36:47.900 --> 36:50.540
Thank you. Thank you
so much, Shirley.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.860
I'll bet you made your
grandson very proud.

36:56.700 --> 37:00.350
Okay, call me a cultural
imperialist if you want,

37:00.360 --> 37:03.850
but I think bullfighting
is a horrid sport.

37:03.860 --> 37:08.130
And to let a 10 year old
do it seems beyond insane.

37:08.540 --> 37:10.300
The truth is…

37:10.310 --> 37:15.010
we cannot create risk-free environments
for our children, especially in sports.

37:15.050 --> 37:19.210
The other truth is this
is not a judge's decision.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.690
It's a parental one.

37:20.700 --> 37:24.530
And as Ms Lloyd put
it, I'm not his mother.

37:24.960 --> 37:29.040
The two of you need to come
together and figure this out.

37:29.050 --> 37:34.066
There is no evidence that this man is
otherwise an unfit or unloving father.

37:34.870 --> 37:36.690
I am leaving custody as is,

37:36.700 --> 37:39.300
and I am throwing
the ball back to you.

37:40.010 --> 37:41.930
Mr Obisbo…

37:41.940 --> 37:44.900
I have to live with this decision…

37:44.910 --> 37:47.750
so your son better.

37:49.330 --> 37:50.900
Adjourned.

37:55.320 --> 37:58.170
Okay. Wait, wait, wa, wait.
Why are you hugging me?

37:58.210 --> 38:01.930
I didn't do the closing. She did.
Hug her. Come back here.

38:01.970 --> 38:05.150
Okay, this is not a part of
my culture. I'm not a hugger.

38:05.190 --> 38:07.550
I'm not a hugger! Oh, my God.

38:17.510 --> 38:19.770
They won. Did you hear?

38:19.780 --> 38:21.880
Shirley and Fitz.

38:21.890 --> 38:23.340
So did Katie and the new girl.

38:23.380 --> 38:24.450
I thought Katie was the new girl.

38:24.490 --> 38:25.440
Oh, the newer one.

38:25.480 --> 38:28.490
Oh. They defended the
sacred art of bullfighting.

38:28.530 --> 38:30.080
Well, thank God.

38:32.870 --> 38:34.120
How did you leave it with Fitz?

38:34.160 --> 38:36.120
Mm. I congratulated him.

38:36.130 --> 38:38.968
I told him I still
considered him a friend,

38:39.180 --> 38:41.424
Hoped that we could stay in touch.

38:41.990 --> 38:43.710
Not, uh, “touch” touch.

38:47.080 --> 38:49.420
You're homophobic, Denny. You
do know that about yourself?

38:49.460 --> 38:52.430
I'll hit rehab on my way back
from Nimmo bay.

38:52.980 --> 38:56.480
What about you? What do
you know about yourself?

38:58.250 --> 39:01.070
Lorraine was right on the money.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.850
She affects you, not
just in an exciting way,

39:03.890 --> 39:05.840
but a disturbing one.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.710
I saw your face.
What do you know?

39:19.250 --> 39:23.990
When I was 14…
my mother had a friend,

39:24.450 --> 39:27.190
and she was…

39:27.200 --> 39:29.900
very beautiful, like Lorraine.

39:30.740 --> 39:33.110
Sometimes I would catch her…

39:33.490 --> 39:35.250
looking at me.

39:35.260 --> 39:37.550
I mowed her lawn.

39:37.980 --> 39:43.660
On occasion, I'd peek
over her fence, see her…

39:44.980 --> 39:48.290
by the pool sunbathing, often naked.

39:49.710 --> 39:52.940
I knew… she knew…

39:53.480 --> 39:55.600
I saw.

39:55.610 --> 39:58.740
Anyway, one day I was cutting her lawn.

39:58.750 --> 40:00.540
It was miserably humid.

40:00.550 --> 40:03.880
She invited me in for a…

40:03.890 --> 40:05.770
glass of water.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.160
She was wearing some kind of a…

40:09.730 --> 40:11.530
halter top.

40:11.540 --> 40:14.880
I was so… attracted.

40:15.790 --> 40:18.090
She obviously knew that.

40:20.340 --> 40:24.360
I finished my water and
handed her the glass,

40:25.300 --> 40:27.430
and she took my hand…

40:27.980 --> 40:30.080
and led me into the bedroom.

40:30.890 --> 40:32.950
And then…

40:32.960 --> 40:35.290
“The Graduate” met the “Summer of '42,”

40:35.330 --> 40:38.820
and I was no longer a virgin.

40:41.430 --> 40:43.420
Oh, my God.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.350
What a wonderful childhood you had.

40:48.360 --> 40:51.050
I was 14, Denny. It was statutory rape.

40:52.960 --> 40:56.524
You're the first person I've
ever told that to, Denny.

40:57.840 --> 40:59.370
I actually feel…

40:59.380 --> 41:00.920
Unburdened?

41:02.620 --> 41:03.630
Maybe.

41:03.640 --> 41:05.340
It's good to be affected
by women, Alan.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.800
I've never seen you like this.

41:06.840 --> 41:09.310
I think you should tell Lorraine
what you just shared with me.

41:09.350 --> 41:11.010
Open up to her, Alan.

41:11.020 --> 41:13.250
I promise I won't be jealous.

41:14.510 --> 41:17.546
You really are an
extraordinary friend, Denny.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.550
Everybody needs somebody.

41:19.920 --> 41:21.060
Well, I've got you.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.770
Damn right.

41:24.260 --> 41:26.940
You know, when you were
telling the story, I…

41:26.980 --> 41:28.730
pitched a fly rod
right in my waders.

41:28.770 --> 41:30.450
Oh, here we go.

41:30.460 --> 41:32.160
Well, I'm— I'm
sharing with you, man.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.230
The trouble with you is you don't
like to listen. I'm a good listener.

41:34.270 --> 41:35.740
Tell me the story again.

41:35.780 --> 41:36.870
Just forget it.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.390
Your problem is you're selfish.

41:38.430 --> 41:40.110
I tell you my stories.

41:40.120 --> 41:42.570
I just told you mine. I just
don't feel like telling you twice.

41:42.610 --> 41:44.070
Fine.

41:44.650 --> 41:46.190
Thank you.

41:48.290 --> 41:49.540
Can I be there when you tell Lorraine?

41:49.580 --> 41:50.500
Denny…

41:50.510 --> 41:51.690
Fine…

41:53.490 --> 41:54.710
Selfish.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.260
–I'll go to rehab.
–Funny.
