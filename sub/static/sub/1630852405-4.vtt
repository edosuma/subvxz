00:40.541 --> 00:43.043
Look at the size of that hole.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.796
‐ It's like something
burned its way through.

00:45.796 --> 00:47.756
Like a machine.

00:47.756 --> 00:50.384
‐ Or a dragon.

00:50.384 --> 00:53.512
‐ You're saying a <i>dragon</i>
did all this damage?

00:53.512 --> 00:55.889
‐ I don't know,
and I'm not sure I want to,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.350
so let's get outta here
before it comes back.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.778
You heard that, too, right?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.410
Tom! Look!

01:16.410 --> 01:19.079
It's another Gembreaker!

01:19.705 --> 01:22.624
‐ That one looks hurt.
Come on. Maybe we can help.

01:22.624 --> 01:25.127
‐ What? Help? Tom, no! Wait!

01:26.545 --> 01:28.046
Kullerson!

01:28.046 --> 01:30.716
Gembreakers are not friendly, remember?

01:30.716 --> 01:34.219
‐ I remember. We just fought off three
of them, like, five minutes ago!

01:34.219 --> 01:36.013
But, I can't leave
an injured dragon alone.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.890
Can you?

01:39.016 --> 01:40.184
Ah!

01:41.810 --> 01:44.897
I couldn't leave you trapped under those
rocks either, now could I, pal?

01:44.897 --> 01:47.733
I know you're concerned,
but trust me. I got this.

01:58.410 --> 02:00.662
Okay!

02:00.662 --> 02:02.372
Maybe I don't got this!

02:15.719 --> 02:18.347
‐ Aw, you poor thing.

02:19.598 --> 02:23.143
Okay, okay,
you're right. We should help it.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.270
‐ Rakke Town has a hospital
in the big dome.

02:25.270 --> 02:28.148
Maybe we can find something there.
‐ To help...

02:28.148 --> 02:29.775
a dragon?

02:29.775 --> 02:32.402
‐ I don't know.
Not a lot of other options.

02:37.199 --> 02:40.202
‐ Don't worry, little dragon.
We'll be right back.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.840
‐ What is it, pal?

02:55.008 --> 02:56.051
‐ That sounds like...

02:56.051 --> 02:57.886
An ICARIS drone!

02:57.886 --> 02:59.805
Thunder! Boom!

03:05.269 --> 03:08.105
‐ Did it see us?
‐ I hope not.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.984
‐ Whoa!

03:15.070 --> 03:17.114
‐ Oh, man.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.199
We just lost another drone.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.119
‐ What happened?
‐ Lemme check the footage.

03:22.119 --> 03:25.038
Nothing but fissure, then zap.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.456
See ya.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.542
‐ Perhaps <i>operator</i> error?

03:28.542 --> 03:30.878
‐ Wait, what? Who's an operator?

03:30.878 --> 03:33.213
It's all automatic!
I just push the buttons

03:33.213 --> 03:35.007
people tell me to push.

03:35.007 --> 03:38.552
Ooh, I don't think
I should've pushed that one.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.972
‐ If this is too much responsibility
for you, dear, just say so.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.601
‐ She's doing fine, May.

03:45.601 --> 03:49.313
Something's happening out there,
not in here. See?

03:49.313 --> 03:52.316
There's a flash just before
the drone goes offline.

03:52.316 --> 03:54.276
There's some bizarre electro

03:54.276 --> 03:56.445
and geomagnetic anomalies happening.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.823
What is that?

Remember,
when we get to the hospital,

04:21.595 --> 04:23.805
we can't tell anybody what we're up to.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.517
Ah! Earthquake!

04:26.517 --> 04:28.018

‐ Okay! Stay calm!

04:36.235 --> 04:37.945
‐ That was the biggest one yet.

04:37.945 --> 04:40.864
‐ Easily a seven or more. Come on.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.616
D'Angelo!

04:44.618 --> 04:47.538
D'Angelo?
Over here, Mom!

04:48.455 --> 04:49.289
‐ Are you alright?

04:49.957 --> 04:52.626
‐ Yeah, I'm good. Ow.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.169
Mostly good.

04:54.169 --> 04:57.589
‐ Okay then.
Let's get this place cleaned up.

04:57.589 --> 05:00.592
Box brigade, double time! One, two!

05:00.592 --> 05:03.011
One, two!

05:03.011 --> 05:04.763
By the way, it's Saturday.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.099
How come you're hanging out with
your mom and not the other kids?

05:07.099 --> 05:09.893
‐ I don't think anyone
wants to hang with me.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.396
Tom and Jun are always disappearing.

05:12.396 --> 05:14.606
‐ What about Alex Gonzalez?

05:14.606 --> 05:18.110
‐ She's best friends
with her tablet. I just...

05:18.902 --> 05:21.572
I really thought this place
was gonna be cool.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.534
‐ Honey,

05:25.534 --> 05:28.203
this place is different, yes,

05:28.203 --> 05:29.913
but people are people.

05:29.913 --> 05:33.292
You let down your guard,
and you'll find some way to connect.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.793
You always do.

05:35.711 --> 05:36.879
‐ Thanks, Mom.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.728
‐ What we really need
are some herbal candles, or‐‐

05:52.728 --> 05:55.272
Better yet, healing crystals,

05:55.272 --> 05:56.982
considering the dragon
has crystals in its‐‐

05:56.982 --> 05:59.610
‐ Jun,
just grab a first aid kit, and let's go.

06:03.739 --> 06:05.490
‐ What are you two doing?

06:05.490 --> 06:08.493
‐
Oh! Hey, D'Angelo!

06:08.493 --> 06:11.246
We were just...
‐ We need a first aid kit.

06:11.246 --> 06:14.208
We found an injured lizard
and wanted to help it.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.250
‐ What she said.

06:15.626 --> 06:18.295
‐ An injured lizard...

06:18.295 --> 06:20.422
Aw! I wanna help, too!

06:20.422 --> 06:22.466
Why didn't you ask Dr. D?

06:22.466 --> 06:24.593
Dr. D?

06:24.593 --> 06:27.804
‐ Yeah. I spent my summers with
my grandpop. He's a veterinarian.

06:27.804 --> 06:31.058
I picked up a few vet skills along
the way. I'll come with you!

06:31.058 --> 06:34.061
‐ I don't know if‐‐
‐ I think that's a great idea.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.395
‐ Can you give us a sec?

06:36.563 --> 06:39.525
What are you doing?
We don't need D'Angelo. I got this.

06:39.525 --> 06:42.528
‐ What you got was
almost loogie‐blasted to pieces!

06:42.528 --> 06:45.489
Look, neither of us know
anything about injured animals.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.283
I mean, well, I know a thing
or two about unicorn horns,

06:48.283 --> 06:51.036
but that doesn't really apply right now.
‐ Bad idea.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.705
His dad is the head of security
for the Rakke Corporation.

06:53.705 --> 06:55.374
Remember the secret?

06:55.374 --> 06:59.878
‐ Dragon Club!

06:59.878 --> 07:01.755
‐ Dragon Club...

07:01.755 --> 07:04.341
Ooh! That sounds cool!

07:07.970 --> 07:11.181
‐ Okay, so listen up.
The first rule of Dragon Club

07:11.181 --> 07:12.975
is you don't talk about
Dragon Club.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.309
It's a secret.

07:14.309 --> 07:17.563
Can you keep a secret, D'Angelo?
‐ Can I keep a secret?

07:17.563 --> 07:19.565
Of course I can keep a secret!

07:19.565 --> 07:21.942
I vow
on the Army Rangers.

07:21.942 --> 07:24.236
‐ See, Tom? Nothing to worry about.

07:24.236 --> 07:25.863
He vowed on the Army Rangers.

07:25.863 --> 07:28.866
‐ What does that even mean?
‐ Dude, Rangers are only

07:28.866 --> 07:31.785
the bravest and most
loyal of the airborne units.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.496
You know my Pops was a Ranger.
Our word means a lot.

07:35.914 --> 07:39.668
Oh, but he would <i>not</i> approve of us
being this far beyond our perimeter.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.295
Even to help an injured animal.

07:41.295 --> 07:45.507
It is a violation of <i>numerous</i>
ICARIS safety codes.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.429
The lizard's down the hole?

07:50.429 --> 07:52.431
‐ Oh yeah. Way down.

08:01.106 --> 08:03.317
‐ Oh, man. Pops knew you were trouble.

08:03.942 --> 08:07.404
‐ Oh, he is. With a capital T.
This is worth it.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.492
‐ Ah! What was that? I heard something.

08:12.492 --> 08:15.621
‐ Prepare yourself to never
be the same in three,

08:15.621 --> 08:17.998
two, one.

08:23.587 --> 08:26.673
‐ That is a big lizard.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.302
‐ Yup. This is Thunder, and he's a dragon.

08:30.302 --> 08:34.056
‐ And that's Wu, and Wei.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.518
‐ We're surrounded!

08:44.441 --> 08:46.527
‐ So glad we revealed the secret
to him.

08:46.527 --> 08:48.111
He's been... <i>so</i> helpful.

08:49.446 --> 08:51.490
Hm...

08:55.953 --> 08:58.455
‐ Oh man.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.249
I had the craziest dream.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.503
Ah! Ah! I mean nightmare!

09:04.503 --> 09:06.672
‐ Just relax, D'Angelo.

09:06.672 --> 09:09.091
‐ Relax? I'm on a dragon!

09:09.091 --> 09:12.219
A huge, flying dragon!

09:12.219 --> 09:13.720
Isn't it awesome?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.806
‐ Didn't I mention that
I'm afraid of heights?!

09:15.806 --> 09:19.268
Ah!

09:19.268 --> 09:21.061
Now, I know why no one
talks about Dragon Club

09:21.061 --> 09:23.230
because no one survives Dragon Club!

09:23.230 --> 09:26.316
‐ These dragons are our friends.
They're not gonna hurt you.

09:29.027 --> 09:32.364
‐ This is a direct
violation of...

09:32.364 --> 09:33.282
everything!

09:33.282 --> 09:35.909
I've gotta report this.
‐ No, you can't!

09:35.909 --> 09:39.037
We have to keep this secret to protect
the dragons. If anyone finds out‐‐

09:44.126 --> 09:46.253
H‐hello?
<i>Tom, it's Alex.</i>

09:46.253 --> 09:49.089
I caught an image of
something in the fissure.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.466
Looks kinda... wingy.

09:51.466 --> 09:55.262
‐ Wingy? Uh,
I'm kinda busy right now, Alex,

09:55.262 --> 09:58.682
but I'll come by later,
and we can talk about it. Okay? See ya!

09:58.682 --> 10:01.059
This is starting to get outta hand.

10:12.863 --> 10:15.115
<i>And</i> there he goes again.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.410
‐ D'Angelo! Do not go into the light!

10:18.410 --> 10:21.371
‐ He's passed out, not dead. Thunder?

10:23.790 --> 10:24.833
Give him a little juice.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.800
‐ Where are we?
Same place you were before.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.302
A giant world of dragons.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.304
‐ Now, let's help that
injured dragon before‐‐

10:37.304 --> 10:39.473
‐ Nope! No! No, no. Uh uh.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.391
You said lizard.

10:41.391 --> 10:44.853
You didn't say anything
about an <i>injured dragon!</i>

10:44.853 --> 10:46.230
I knew y'all were crazy.

10:46.230 --> 10:48.732
Why didn't I listen to
that little voice inside?

10:48.732 --> 10:50.692
"Those kids might seem cool, son,

10:50.692 --> 10:52.611
but they're gonna get you killed."

10:52.611 --> 10:55.322
‐ That little voice sounds
an awful lot like your dad.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.783
‐ Please, D'Angelo. You're the only one

10:57.783 --> 11:00.077
who knows anything about injured animals.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.580
‐ Nope. Not it. I'm already trying
to figure out how I'm gonna tell Pop.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.457
‐ I'll help you figure that out!

11:05.457 --> 11:06.917
You're not.

11:06.917 --> 11:09.920
‐ Oh. And how are <i>you</i> gonna stop <i>me</i>?

11:10.963 --> 11:14.174
‐ We could just leave you down here.
‐ Huh?

11:14.174 --> 11:17.636
‐ Come on. The dragon's right over here.
She has a hurt wing.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.473
‐ <i>Was</i> right over here.

11:21.473 --> 11:24.184
‐ She must've... flown away?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.061
‐ Not with a hurt wing she didn't.

11:26.061 --> 11:28.313
An injured animal isn't gonna
lay out here in the open.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.816
It's gonna find cover
from potential predators.

11:42.786 --> 11:44.538
‐ See? There she is.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.207
Oh.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.251
That dragon looks like a wounded warrior.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.799
‐ And she needs your help.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.265
‐ Okay, fine.

12:03.265 --> 12:06.768
The first thing we have to do is triage.
Figure out exactly what's wrong.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.814
Shh. It's okay.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.567
That doesn't sound good!

12:15.485 --> 12:16.862
Run!
Go!

12:17.988 --> 12:20.032
‐ Did you know it could do that?

12:20.032 --> 12:23.702
‐ I mean... yeah. I guess
we kinda knew. Sorry.

12:23.702 --> 12:27.289
‐ I'm sorry, too. Even though
it's more his fault than mine.

12:27.289 --> 12:28.790
‐ Is there anything else I need to know

12:28.790 --> 12:32.085
about the angry, bomb‐blasting,
armored dragon?

12:32.085 --> 12:34.671
‐ Mm, I think that about covers it.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.466
‐ Yup! Yeah, that's the main stuff. Oh!

12:37.466 --> 12:41.053
Uh, they're <i>faster</i> than they look.
Right.

12:41.053 --> 12:43.722
Yep. Important point
for after it gets healed.

12:43.722 --> 12:46.558
‐ Any other ideas on how we
can get close enough to help it?

12:46.558 --> 12:49.645
‐ Uh... double‐flanking maneuver.
Works every time.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.897
Tom, you and Sparky here
cover the right flank.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.317
Jun and I will take the Wonder Twins
and cover left.

12:55.317 --> 12:57.694
We'll overpower the dragon
from both sides,

12:57.694 --> 12:59.363
then, when we have it under control,

12:59.363 --> 13:01.406
we'll administer aid.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.497
‐ I'm with you, pal.

13:08.497 --> 13:10.332
I wanted to keep Dragon Club a secret.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.513
‐ Now!

13:25.430 --> 13:26.473
Huh?

13:28.851 --> 13:29.977
Ah!

13:33.689 --> 13:36.859
‐ Did I mention dragons are also smart?
‐ Fall back! Fall back!

13:41.196 --> 13:42.823
What did you get me into?

13:42.823 --> 13:45.284
‐ We got you <i>into</i>
helping a wounded animal.

13:45.284 --> 13:48.412
‐ Well <i>now</i>, you can get
me back <i>into</i> my home!

13:55.335 --> 13:58.005
‐ So, you're just gonna leave?

14:02.217 --> 14:04.553
‐ Nah, you're right. I'll stay and help.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.055
Nobody, not even a grouchy old dragon,

14:07.055 --> 14:09.433
should be left out here,
injured and alone.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.602
‐ We're gonna need another plan though.

14:11.602 --> 14:13.604
‐ I think I have another plan.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.191
‐ A tranquilizer? Who's gonna do that?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.613
Why didn't I listen
to that little voice inside?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.829
Okay. After I give the injection,

14:30.829 --> 14:34.333
we'll have to work fast to bandage
and splint the wing, so be ready.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.417
‐ We will be.

14:44.301 --> 14:47.387
‐ Alright, you gorgeous dragon.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.182
Time for you to get some D'Angelo!

14:56.355 --> 14:57.856
‐ I can't watch!

14:57.856 --> 15:00.025
‐ How did we ever think
this was a good idea?

15:18.252 --> 15:20.420
‐ Aw, you poor girl.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.590
You've seen your share of battles, huh?
Let's see if I have something here.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.595
There you go.

15:29.805 --> 15:32.349
You're not such a bad girl.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.518
It's just like Momma says.

15:34.518 --> 15:37.521
You just gotta let your guard down,
and you'll find some way to connect.

15:39.690 --> 15:42.442
‐ He made it!
‐ Yeah, and he survived.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.111
His parents'll be so happy.

15:44.111 --> 15:47.114
‐ You hurt your wing?
I'm gonna take a look, okay?

15:49.783 --> 15:50.909
Hm...

15:50.909 --> 15:53.453
Doesn't seem broken.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.663
Ah ha.

15:54.663 --> 15:56.790
I think we found the problem.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.542
Hold still now...

16:08.051 --> 16:08.802
You're all done.

16:10.262 --> 16:12.681
You know, you're not a half bad patient,

16:12.681 --> 16:15.058
but you're lucky I don't have a cone
big enough to put on your head.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.899
‐ You did it!
‐ Nice job!

16:21.899 --> 16:24.568
‐ Dr. D saves the day!

16:26.820 --> 16:29.907
Uh, what does that mean?
‐ It's never good.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.746
‐ Those guys again?
‐ <i>Again</i>?

16:35.746 --> 16:37.456
‐ Yeah, we had a little run‐in before.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.583
They can be a bit territorial.

16:41.293 --> 16:43.587
Wait! They must be
coming back for the little one!

16:43.587 --> 16:45.380
‐ Quick! Hide before they spot us!

16:45.380 --> 16:47.508
We don't want them
rejecting one of their own.

16:47.508 --> 16:50.344
‐ I don't know.
Something doesn't feel right.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.098
‐ Aw, they recognize her!

16:59.561 --> 17:02.272
Oh, man! What are they doing?

17:02.272 --> 17:05.067
‐ Those must be the bullies who
beat her up in the first place!

17:05.067 --> 17:07.027
Hey! Stop that!
‐ No, wait!

17:07.027 --> 17:08.362
‐ Get away from her!

17:10.656 --> 17:12.199
Oops. Ah!

17:14.076 --> 17:15.577
Help me!

17:16.703 --> 17:18.455
Run, D!

17:18.455 --> 17:19.706
Get on with Jun!

17:20.415 --> 17:23.418
‐

17:30.801 --> 17:32.636
Where'd that little Gembreaker go?

17:32.636 --> 17:35.681
‐ She's long gone, and we've
got our own problems!

17:38.725 --> 17:40.227
‐ Jun! Look out!

17:48.193 --> 17:50.195
‐ Okay, Wu, ice 'em up!

17:58.036 --> 18:00.622
Now, Wei, bring the heat!

18:06.879 --> 18:08.213
‐ Yeah, Jun!

18:10.841 --> 18:12.676
Let's crash him into the crystals!

18:17.681 --> 18:18.807
Okay, that didn't work.

18:18.807 --> 18:21.185
Head for the fissure! Whoa!

18:22.102 --> 18:25.939
They're not letting us get away.
Yeah, they're like that.

18:36.617 --> 18:37.367
‐ Watch out!

18:39.703 --> 18:42.080
‐ D'Angelo!

18:51.798 --> 18:55.761
I'm good. She broke my fall! Kinda.

18:57.763 --> 18:59.765
Thanks for trying to save my butt, girl.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.523
Whoa!

19:09.608 --> 19:11.818
‐ Jun! Let's split up and find D'Angelo.

19:18.992 --> 19:20.744
‐ We've gotta help!

19:20.744 --> 19:22.663
What are you doing?

19:22.663 --> 19:25.332
We can't bug out! Our team needs us!

19:25.332 --> 19:27.042
No Ranger left behind.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.589
‐ Tom, think of something!
‐ I'm thinking...

19:32.589 --> 19:34.800
you're the brains of this outfit.

19:34.800 --> 19:37.511
‐ Slow down!
Where's the brakes on this thing?

19:37.511 --> 19:39.555
What are you doing?!

19:46.395 --> 19:50.232
Attacking from above! Ranger style!

19:50.232 --> 19:52.234
I like the way you think, girl.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.527
Hit it again!

20:19.928 --> 20:23.724
And don't come back unless
you want some more D'Angelo!

20:23.724 --> 20:25.309
Woohoo!

20:25.309 --> 20:28.604
Yo! Did you see her out there?

20:28.604 --> 20:30.647
She went full Gemzilla,

20:30.647 --> 20:32.774
just <i>plowed</i> her horn
right into that crystal.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.027
Sent those bullies flying for the hills.

20:35.027 --> 20:38.488
‐ You two were great.
‐ Okay, I have to admit.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.574
You were right.
‐ You said it yourself,

20:40.574 --> 20:43.577
I'm the brains of this outfit.
‐ No argument from me.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.330
Welcome to Dragon Club.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.875
‐ Get in here!
‐ Okay!

20:49.875 --> 20:52.628
You're a hugger... That's cool...
‐ Well,

20:52.628 --> 20:55.756
now that you're bonded,
you have to give her a name.

20:56.298 --> 20:59.843
‐ Plowhorn. Her name is Plowhorn.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.478
Woohoo!

21:09.478 --> 21:11.355
Yeah!

21:17.986 --> 21:20.697
‐ You sure Plowhorn's okay?
‐ Totally.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.491
Thunder and Wu and Wei will make her feel

21:22.491 --> 21:25.536
right at home.
‐ She'll be fine. And remember,

21:25.536 --> 21:27.663
this whole thing is a secret.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.332
‐ Thanks so much for dinner.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.501
‐ Yeah, this is great.

21:32.501 --> 21:34.920
‐ You're always welcome.
‐ Yeah.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.090
We figured with your moms working late,
you could use a home‐cooked meal.

21:38.090 --> 21:41.844
‐ I'm just happy D'Angelo got a chance
to spend some time with you two.

21:45.514 --> 21:49.059
‐ So, what do teenagers do on
a Saturday in the middle of nowhere?

21:49.059 --> 21:52.312
‐ Well, Pop, first I met some dragons,
which was kinda crazy.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.815
Then, we went deep underground
and almost got killed

21:54.815 --> 21:56.650
trying to rescue this other dragon.

21:56.650 --> 21:59.570
Then, we had this insane
dragon sky battle! I mean, it was,

21:59.570 --> 22:02.072
boom! Boom! Explosions everywhere!

22:02.072 --> 22:03.657
It was sick!

22:05.117 --> 22:07.995
‐ What?
‐ It's called Dragon Club, Phil.

22:07.995 --> 22:09.997
It's a role‐playing game, right?

22:13.959 --> 22:15.002
Mm‐hmm!
Uh‐huh.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.880
‐ Oh. Alright, well,

22:17.880 --> 22:20.507
that sounds okay, I guess.

22:20.507 --> 22:23.635
‐ Yeah! Yeah, it's all fun and games,
until you get eaten.

22:33.187 --> 22:35.355
‐ Please pass the potatoes!
