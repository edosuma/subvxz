WEBVTT

00:22.816 --> 00:25.527
Oh,my god,the suspect.

00:26.653 --> 00:28.071
He's your son.

00:42.502 --> 00:45.213
8 hours earlier

00:45.714 --> 00:48.050
Attention all units,we
have a possible barricade.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.385
Suspect is armed and handling a hostage.

00:50.427 --> 00:53.638
Victim is a probation officer
held in his own residence.

01:03.648 --> 01:04.900
I got three other units on the way.

01:04.941 --> 01:05.984
Extended eta'S.

01:06.026 --> 01:08.362
Throw up a containment ou arnd
the house as quick as you can.

01:08.403 --> 01:09.613
Make it quick.

01:09.863 --> 01:10.822
Shots fired?

01:10.864 --> 01:14.159
Yeah,dispatch got a broken
911 call from a guy inside.

01:14.201 --> 01:15.494
We think he's a probation officer.

01:15.535 --> 01:17.120
What happened? You get
knocked back to uniform?

01:17.162 --> 01:18.747
These are stripes,sparky,all right?

01:18.789 --> 01:20.207
You're as dumb as you look.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.209
I just passed the sergeant's exam.

01:24.294 --> 01:25.545
hey,you called in swat?

01:25.587 --> 01:26.838
Well,hell,yeah,I called in swat team.

01:26.880 --> 01:28.674
911 reported a hostage situation.

01:28.715 --> 01:29.508
Any demands?

01:29.549 --> 01:30.425
He's not made any yet.

01:30.467 --> 01:31.301
We need a phone connection.

01:31.343 --> 01:32.094
I've already tried that.

01:32.135 --> 01:33.804
I heard my voice on the machine inside.

01:33.845 --> 01:35.430
I got two units east...

01:35.764 --> 01:38.684
S.R.T. 30,move in now.
S.R.T. 30,move in now.

01:58.328 --> 02:00.205
Man down!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.292
Going around back!

02:17.305 --> 02:20.058
Suspect is on foot
heading towards the canal.

02:30.527 --> 02:32.154
S.R.T. 30 to air ship.

02:32.195 --> 02:35.657
Suspect eastbound in the
canal driving a frauscher 757.

02:55.052 --> 02:56.595
Detective berkeley.

02:56.678 --> 02:58.722
Our victim out front is andrew bennett.

02:58.764 --> 03:00.474
He's a miami-dade probation officer.

03:00.515 --> 03:02.517
He was being held
hostage in his own home.

03:02.559 --> 03:04.853
Till someone decided he was expendable.

03:04.895 --> 03:06.855
We got birds in the air right
now trying to track him down,

03:06.897 --> 03:09.316
but this guy knew how to duck and run.

03:09.358 --> 03:10.984
Who's the young lady?

03:11.109 --> 03:12.736
It's the victim's daughter.

03:12.944 --> 03:15.530
Says her old man used to work
with ex-convicts 24/seven.

03:15.572 --> 03:16.907
Adult and juvie.

03:16.948 --> 03:18.241
Quite the workload.

03:18.325 --> 03:20.702
His file says he has,like,2,000 cases.

03:21.578 --> 03:25.248
2,000 cases,and now 2,000 suspects.

04:35.069 --> 04:36.654
Good morning,alexx.

04:37.488 --> 04:40.241
one of these
days,horatio,that'll be true.

04:40.283 --> 04:43.286
So,this poor guy fell two stories.

04:43.453 --> 04:46.706
Alexx,we had a gunshot
wound to the chest.

04:46.748 --> 04:48.291
Do you have an exit wound?

04:48.333 --> 04:51.753
Two inches to the right of his scapula.

04:51.836 --> 04:56.007
Based on the entrance,strong chance
bullet passed right through his heart.

04:56.049 --> 04:57.133
Death was immediate.

04:57.175 --> 04:59.927
Which would have made
the fall irrelevant.

05:01.304 --> 05:04.724
Maybe the killer used
it as part of his escape.

05:07.685 --> 05:09.812
Diversionary tactic.

05:30.291 --> 05:32.794
Looks like he went
toe-to-toe with his assailant.

05:32.835 --> 05:35.129
Got someone else's skin here.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.757
Get that to dna,please.

05:38.132 --> 05:39.300
Yeah.

05:39.926 --> 05:41.302
Thank you,alexx.

05:44.514 --> 05:46.516
Yeah. Then let's widen the search area.

05:46.557 --> 05:48.476
Include broward county if you have to.

05:49.686 --> 05:51.104
Fine. Let me know.

05:53.523 --> 05:55.274
I'm going to call you back.

05:56.442 --> 05:57.944
Morning,officer pretty.

05:57.985 --> 06:00.154
Did you get a chance to
talk to the victim's wife?

06:00.196 --> 06:01.155
I'm trying.

06:01.197 --> 06:03.157
She's in europe visiting family.

06:03.700 --> 06:06.077
But it sounds like she
was born into some money.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.037
Well,that would explain the house.

06:08.121 --> 06:09.122
Well,I don't get it.

06:09.163 --> 06:13.876
If you're sitting on this kind of dough,why
grind it out as a probation officer?

06:13.918 --> 06:16.629
I don't know. Maybe he
wanted to make a difference.

06:17.547 --> 06:21.676
Well,when I find my sugar mama,I'm
trading in the cruiser for a bentley.

06:24.220 --> 06:26.055
What did you find in the house?

06:26.097 --> 06:27.765
No forced entry.

06:28.307 --> 06:29.934
The victim let the shooter in.

06:29.976 --> 06:32.729
I guess our murder weapon hitched
a ride on the getaway boat.

06:32.770 --> 06:34.772
Tripp's running down a list
of the victim's probationers,

06:34.814 --> 06:37.817
and I'm on my way to find the boat.

06:37.859 --> 06:38.609
All right.

06:38.651 --> 06:40.445
Well,good luck with that.

06:48.077 --> 06:49.245
Hey,eric.

06:50.621 --> 06:51.706
Nice tan.

06:51.789 --> 06:53.041
Five days in antigua.

06:53.082 --> 06:55.418
It's the first vacation
I've had in a long time.

06:55.460 --> 06:57.795
Yeah. I saw jake outside.

06:57.837 --> 06:59.422
He's got the same tan.

07:04.886 --> 07:06.512
What you get from the wall?

07:06.763 --> 07:07.722
Two rounds.

07:07.764 --> 07:10.099
Look like they might be. 45 caliber.

07:11.851 --> 07:13.394
It's a. 40.

07:17.231 --> 07:19.067
no lands and grooves.

07:19.692 --> 07:20.735
Well,what does that mean?

07:20.777 --> 07:23.613
It's either from an H.K. Or a glock.

07:23.654 --> 07:24.864
You don't see it very often.

07:24.906 --> 07:25.990
You find any casings?

07:26.032 --> 07:28.534
No. The shooter must
have scooped them both up.

07:28.576 --> 07:30.745
You brought the
electrostatic dust lifter.

07:30.787 --> 07:34.123
Yeah,there's a decent shoe
print over there by marker three.

07:37.627 --> 07:39.504
Ooh,That is a nice one.

07:40.004 --> 07:42.048
Very clear wear pattern on the heel.

07:42.090 --> 07:43.675
Do you mind if I lift it?

07:43.716 --> 07:45.218
No,go ahead.

07:52.558 --> 07:55.061
So,have you gotdeny I aa who
we're looking at for this?

07:55.103 --> 07:56.270
I mean...

07:57.105 --> 08:01.567
I'm sure the probation officer had
more than a few strained relationships.

08:01.609 --> 08:08.241
Oh,with,uh,all of his ex-cons right here
in the palm of his hand,there's no doubt.

08:08.324 --> 08:10.284
Not to mention,he's judge and jury.

08:10.326 --> 08:13.371
He could send any violator
away for a maximum sentence.

08:13.413 --> 08:16.416
Yeah,I'm sure there's lots
of people want to kill him.

08:22.672 --> 08:25.925
Question is,o whactually
decided to do it?

08:37.227 --> 08:38.604
Stop right there,please.

08:38.645 --> 08:39.813
What?

08:40.481 --> 08:42.567
Okay,come forward.

08:42.775 --> 08:44.235
Have a seat,dylan.

08:46.779 --> 08:48.489
I thought you wanted to talk to me.

08:53.327 --> 08:55.913
No. It's not necessary.

08:56.456 --> 08:57.832
You just spoke to me.

08:57.874 --> 09:02.503
We found these treads and this wear
pattern in your probation officer's house.

09:02.545 --> 09:03.212
What? You can't do that.

09:03.254 --> 09:05.506
Don't you need,like,permission
or something?

09:05.548 --> 09:07.175
You mean,like a warrant?

09:07.216 --> 09:08.051
No,dylan.

09:08.092 --> 09:11.304
We found your skin underneath the
probation officer's fingernails.

09:11.346 --> 09:14.432
We have everything we
need,including permission.

09:14.474 --> 09:16.476
Someone killed andrew bennett.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.561
Right now,you're our primary suspect.

09:18.603 --> 09:20.229
Okay,wait a second.

09:21.064 --> 09:22.732
My P.O. Caught me,okay?

09:22.774 --> 09:24.275
In his house.

09:24.400 --> 09:27.737
I was with his daughter
stephanie in her bedroom.

09:27.904 --> 09:29.405
He was pissed off.

09:29.447 --> 09:30.740
You let him in here?

09:30.782 --> 09:31.491
Dad,stop! It's okay.

09:31.532 --> 09:33.034
- No,it's not okay,stephanie.
- It's okay.

09:33.076 --> 09:34.619
- I'm leaving.
- No,get back here.

09:36.162 --> 09:37.372
Dad! It's okay.

09:37.413 --> 09:39.040
- What were you thinking about,stephanie?
- Why do you have to act like that?

09:39.082 --> 09:41.668
He's one of my probationers.

09:41.793 --> 09:43.044
I didn't shoot him.

09:43.086 --> 09:45.171
I don't even know how to hold a gun.

09:45.797 --> 09:48.299
They busted me for computer hacking.

09:48.925 --> 09:51.427
Look,I've never hurt anybody in my life.

09:51.469 --> 09:53.429
Check with stephanie,all right?

09:53.513 --> 09:55.932
Talk to her. I'm telling you the truth.

10:14.992 --> 10:16.953
I thought I could trust dylan.

10:17.286 --> 10:18.454
He wasn't like the
rest of them,you know?

10:18.496 --> 10:20.081
He was smart.

10:20.999 --> 10:25.253
Stephanie,that may be,but
dylan had a criminal record,

10:25.294 --> 10:28.131
and your dad was making sure
that he fulfilled his probation.

10:28.172 --> 10:29.048
I know.

10:29.507 --> 10:32.051
My dad yelled at me for
bringing him home,but...

10:32.844 --> 10:34.387
I wouldn't listen.

10:37.515 --> 10:39.934
Your father was a good man,stephanie.

10:39.976 --> 10:41.769
We need more like him.

10:42.979 --> 10:45.982
My dad always had this
ability to read people.

10:46.232 --> 10:51.070
He knew who we could trust
and who to look out for.

10:54.991 --> 10:57.035
Did I get my father killed?

10:59.871 --> 11:01.205
Stephanie...

11:01.664 --> 11:05.793
I'm going to find out who
got your dad killed. Okay?

11:09.922 --> 11:11.090
Okay.

11:28.926 --> 11:30.511
Excuse me? Could I get some help?

11:30.553 --> 11:31.721
Yeah.

11:33.097 --> 11:34.515
Natalia?

11:34.766 --> 11:36.517
What are you doing here?

11:36.642 --> 11:39.520
I gotta make a living.

11:39.562 --> 11:41.731
But I helped you with all that
paperwork so you could get reinstated.

11:41.773 --> 11:43.066
Yeah,I submitted all that paperwork.

11:43.107 --> 11:47.653
And now the fdle panel is
going through my paychecks.

11:47.779 --> 11:48.988
To watch for gambling?

11:49.030 --> 11:50.114
Something like that.

11:50.156 --> 11:51.991
Oh,then there's also,uh,psych services,

11:52.033 --> 11:54.827
they're giving me conduct evaluations.

11:54.911 --> 11:57.371
No way,you're kidding. For how long?

11:57.705 --> 11:59.207
Up to a year.

11:59.373 --> 12:02.085
And I don't get paid in the meantime.

12:02.168 --> 12:04.545
I'm sorry. Wow.

12:05.338 --> 12:07.006
Well,how you been?
What are you doing here?

12:07.048 --> 12:08.382
Uh,taking out some aggression?

12:08.424 --> 12:11.385
No,the handgun ppc quals are coming up.

12:11.427 --> 12:14.806
And I've got to pass them to
qualify to carry a firearm.

12:15.181 --> 12:16.349
Well,there's a department range.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.309
What's wrong with that one?

12:18.768 --> 12:22.105
Yeah,'cause,you know,if
I hit the ceiling,

12:22.146 --> 12:23.981
it's not like I'm ever
gonna hear the end of it.

12:24.023 --> 12:25.566
Natalia,plenty of guys hit the ceiling.

12:25.608 --> 12:26.901
Yeah,the guys.

12:26.943 --> 12:28.444
I'm not a guy.

12:28.569 --> 12:30.696
Practice makes perfect,let's go.

12:34.700 --> 12:35.451
I can load that.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.536
I do know how to do that.

12:36.577 --> 12:37.578
Oh,no,I have to do it.

12:37.620 --> 12:40.039
It's,um,it's part of my gig here.

12:40.081 --> 12:41.457
It's the range rules.

12:41.499 --> 12:42.667
Okay.

12:43.418 --> 12:45.920
So,we've got 15 and one in the chamber.

12:48.589 --> 12:49.924
All right.

12:50.174 --> 12:51.384
Distance?

12:52.760 --> 12:55.638
muzzle velocity 1,000 feet per second.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.306
Effective
range- 100 yards.

12:57.348 --> 12:58.307
That's great.

12:58.349 --> 13:01.018
I meant what distance you
want me to put the target at?

13:01.060 --> 13:05.398
Oh,uh... 25 feet?

13:30.715 --> 13:31.507
one hit.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.384
And 14 misses.

13:33.926 --> 13:35.386
Don't tell anybody how bad I am.

13:35.428 --> 13:36.846
Don't tell anybody I work here.

13:36.888 --> 13:39.140
Deal.

13:48.941 --> 13:51.861
hey,what did the computer
hacker have to say?

13:51.944 --> 13:52.904
He admits to being in the house,

13:52.945 --> 13:55.239
but says he was long gone
at the time of the murder.

13:55.281 --> 13:56.115
Can we confirm that?

13:56.157 --> 13:56.866
Not yet.

13:56.908 --> 13:57.992
What have you got?

13:58.034 --> 14:00.495
The victim's blackberry
from the crime scene.

14:00.536 --> 14:01.704
Any recent phone calls?

14:01.746 --> 14:02.789
No,not a phone call.

14:02.872 --> 14:07.668
A violation message from an ankle monitor
on one of his probationers,kyle harmon.

14:15.718 --> 14:18.971
that means our P.O. Would'veen
be sending kyle back to jail.

14:19.305 --> 14:20.765
Sounds like motive.

14:27.438 --> 14:30.650
We have reason to believe you
killed your probation officer.

14:31.359 --> 14:32.652
No,okay...

14:32.735 --> 14:34.904
mr. Bennett got me the job at mist cafe.

14:34.946 --> 14:36.280
He looked out for me.

14:36.364 --> 14:37.698
Why would I want to kill him?

14:37.740 --> 14:40.201
Maybe because you were
his most recent violation.

14:40.284 --> 14:40.910
What?

14:40.952 --> 14:42.328
I didn't even do anything.

14:42.370 --> 14:46.290
You did six months in juvie for
stealing a boat on biscayne bay.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.460
Yeah,and I haven't done anything since.

14:49.502 --> 14:52.171
Well,joyriding in that boat
was an alcohol-related offense.

14:52.213 --> 14:52.964
So?

14:53.005 --> 14:54.966
So,you're 16,kyle.

14:55.007 --> 14:56.342
Drinking is against the law.

14:56.384 --> 14:59.387
It's also a direct violation
of your probation agreement.

14:59.429 --> 15:01.264
Yeah,and I've followed
that to the letter.

15:01.305 --> 15:02.515
No,not quite.

15:04.058 --> 15:07.603
This data was retrieved from your
probation officer's blackberry.

15:11.232 --> 15:14.318
Your ankle bracelet
has a monitoring system.

15:14.444 --> 15:15.653
It tracks alcohol consumption.

15:15.695 --> 15:18.156
And your geographic location.

15:18.865 --> 15:22.910
Yeah,you know,maybe one of my
friends spilled some alcohol on it.

15:22.952 --> 15:24.328
- I don't know.
- I don't think so.

15:24.370 --> 15:29.000
It measures ethanol vapors off
of your skin- after digestion.

15:54.358 --> 15:56.694
you were afraid he was going
to send you back to juvie.

15:56.736 --> 15:58.488
You made sure he couldn't,right?

15:58.571 --> 15:59.906
I'm not afraid.

16:00.073 --> 16:01.657
Hey,and I didn't kill him!

16:01.741 --> 16:03.826
Try to book me for whatever you want.

16:25.139 --> 16:26.849
Okay. You can take him out.

16:31.145 --> 16:33.481
- Could I have a minute,please,ma'am?
- yes,sir

16:34.357 --> 16:36.317
Listen,okay,he heard
everything I have to say.

16:36.359 --> 16:39.404
If you want to throw men ifor
drinking then talk to my new P.O.

16:39.487 --> 16:42.031
I understand that you
were in a foster home.

16:42.573 --> 16:43.282
Yeah,I guess you could say that.

16:43.324 --> 16:45.243
I've been through a few of 'em.

16:45.660 --> 16:46.828
Okay.

16:46.953 --> 16:48.746
When were you born,son?

16:49.956 --> 16:52.333
July 6,1991.

16:53.835 --> 16:56.462
H... everything okay?

16:56.504 --> 16:58.339
Yeah,everything's fine.

16:59.298 --> 17:00.591
Let's go.

17:17.775 --> 17:19.736
Appreciate you being here.

17:19.986 --> 17:21.945
I haven't seen you in awhile.

17:23.114 --> 17:24.198
Besides,I'm a P.I. Now.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.534
I figured you needed some help.

17:29.120 --> 17:31.247
I'm looking at a
16-year-old foster kid.

17:31.289 --> 17:33.666
His name is kyle harmon.

17:33.750 --> 17:34.751
What do you need?

17:34.792 --> 17:35.668
We need everything.

17:35.710 --> 17:37.044
And it might take some digging.

17:37.086 --> 17:38.629
He's bounced around quite a bit.

17:38.671 --> 17:41.007
Oh. Bad foster homes?

17:41.090 --> 17:43.509
He might be living in one right now.

17:47.555 --> 17:50.516
Horatio,is there something more to this?

17:51.684 --> 17:53.352
Could be.

17:55.772 --> 17:57.023
Okay.

18:13.706 --> 18:15.458
yeah,at southwind pier.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.711
We found the getaway boat and
you guys are jerking me around.

18:18.753 --> 18:21.464
Well,you said that the
last time that I called.

18:21.631 --> 18:24.926
Well,my dog could've towed the
thing back to the garage by now.

18:25.009 --> 18:26.177
That the getaway boat?

18:26.219 --> 18:27.428
Okay,fine.

18:27.512 --> 18:28.721
Let me know.

18:28.763 --> 18:29.972
It is.

18:34.143 --> 18:35.895
patrol found it drifting.

18:35.978 --> 18:37.730
No sign of the driver?

18:37.772 --> 18:40.400
Nope- and we're fourth
in line at the tow yard.

18:40.483 --> 18:42.777
So,it's gonna take a couple of hours.

18:42.860 --> 18:44.445
How was antigua?

18:45.780 --> 18:47.281
It was nice.

18:48.950 --> 18:50.159
berkeley.

18:50.284 --> 18:51.035
Yeah.

18:51.077 --> 18:53.246
Calleigh,what've you got?

18:53.329 --> 18:55.373
.40 caliber casing.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.917
Same casing as you pulled from
the wall at the crime scene.

18:57.959 --> 19:01.712
Swat's incident report indicates
he fired one round from this boat.

19:02.422 --> 19:04.090
But what the hell happened to it?

19:04.132 --> 19:04.715
I don't know.

19:04.757 --> 19:06.467
It was crushed by something on the boat.

19:06.509 --> 19:09.554
Only thing that could do that kind
of damage would've been the engine.

19:25.361 --> 19:28.865
Why would you ride with that hatch
open while the engine's running?

19:28.906 --> 19:30.867
It just causex estra drag.

19:33.995 --> 19:35.371
Hey,mama!

19:35.621 --> 19:37.874
Maybe because you need
to get to your drug stash.

19:37.915 --> 19:38.875
Hello.

19:38.916 --> 19:39.751
Hey!

19:39.792 --> 19:41.335
Ran the numbers on our boat.

19:41.377 --> 19:42.920
It's registered to a business.

19:42.962 --> 19:44.714
The mist cafe.

19:44.756 --> 19:48.301
You know,the kid I talked to-
kyle- he got a job at that place.

19:48.551 --> 19:50.595
Maybe the owner believes
in second chances.

19:50.636 --> 19:53.222
Unfortunately,not
everybody deserves one.

19:56.142 --> 19:57.977
I didn't use that boat for any crime.

19:58.019 --> 19:59.604
Especially murder.

19:59.896 --> 20:02.231
I'm not the only probie who works here.

20:02.273 --> 20:03.983
I mean,the boss did time.

20:04.067 --> 20:05.651
Why don't you go check
up on the blond kid?

20:05.693 --> 20:07.236
Just came out of juvie.
Kyle what's-his-name?

20:07.278 --> 20:09.864
Your manager said that
you drive the boat.

20:09.906 --> 20:12.283
So,I'm starting with you,rick.

20:12.366 --> 20:15.036
Not like I could just take it
out for a joyride anytime I want.

20:15.078 --> 20:18.539
I deliver take-out- up and down
the canals during business hours.

20:18.581 --> 20:23.711
That boat fled my crime scene minutes after
your probation officer was shot to death.

20:33.429 --> 20:34.847
look,dude...

20:35.348 --> 20:36.849
I'm on probation.

20:36.933 --> 20:38.559
I can't own a gun.

20:39.435 --> 20:41.187
I'm here working towards rehabilitation.

20:41.229 --> 20:42.271
Why would I kill the guy who set...

20:42.313 --> 20:45.858
- because he discovered that you were selling drugs.
- What?

20:45.942 --> 20:49.445
We found cocaine in the engine
compartment of the boat,rick.

20:49.487 --> 20:52.115
So,andrew bennett,your
probation officer,

20:52.156 --> 20:55.326
was planning to send you
back to jail,wasn't he?

20:59.664 --> 21:01.416
I'm clean,okay?

21:01.499 --> 21:04.585
The drugs probably belonged
to whoever stole the boat.

21:06.003 --> 21:08.756
I know you don't believe me on
this,but I ain't lying to you.

21:10.633 --> 21:12.885
You had your chance,rick.

21:13.511 --> 21:15.012
You had your chance.

21:31.313 --> 21:32.606
You got to be kidding.

21:35.151 --> 21:36.235
hello?

21:38.362 --> 21:40.030
Mr. Barnes?

21:40.156 --> 21:41.824
Mr. Barnes?

21:42.116 --> 21:43.367
Hello?

21:43.909 --> 21:45.411
Can I help you?

21:48.080 --> 21:49.665
Good afternoon,sir.

21:50.207 --> 21:51.876
You from foster placement?

21:51.917 --> 21:54.086
hey,stop your rassling over there.

21:54.462 --> 21:56.046
I'm yelina salas.

21:56.255 --> 21:57.923
Private investigator?

21:58.048 --> 22:01.010
Just asking you a few questions
regarding your foster child.

22:01.093 --> 22:02.595
I covered that open trench last week.

22:02.678 --> 22:03.971
You can look.

22:04.138 --> 22:05.598
Kyle harmon.

22:07.183 --> 22:08.559
Kyle.

22:08.809 --> 22:11.729
Kyle went to juvie. I don't
collect on him no more.

22:12.980 --> 22:14.315
Touching.

22:14.482 --> 22:16.192
You still have his belongings?

22:16.233 --> 22:17.485
Yeah,in a barrel over there.

22:17.526 --> 22:18.986
Help yourself.

22:54.355 --> 22:56.982
You were right- not
a lot of love there.

22:57.024 --> 22:58.067
How do you mean?

22:58.400 --> 23:00.569
The guy's already got
another kid in kyle's room.

23:00.611 --> 23:03.739
And really,all he cares
about is his $500 a month.

23:03.781 --> 23:05.157
So kyle's not staying there?

23:05.199 --> 23:07.243
No. But he did leave some stuff behind.

23:07.284 --> 23:08.410
Mostly paperwork.

23:08.452 --> 23:11.497
You know,like medical
records,school transfers.

23:11.539 --> 23:12.665
Anything of note?

23:12.706 --> 23:14.834
Been in,uh,foster care since age six.

23:14.875 --> 23:17.253
Mother was a nurse in the military.

23:17.294 --> 23:21.090
Name is a julia... something.

23:21.215 --> 23:22.299
Eberly.

23:24.093 --> 23:26.220
Julia eberly.

23:27.096 --> 23:28.514
Yes.

23:28.556 --> 23:29.890
How did you know that?

23:29.932 --> 23:31.434
Is the boy in contact with her?

23:31.475 --> 23:32.726
Not as far as I can tell.

23:32.768 --> 23:34.854
Not with his father,either.

23:36.605 --> 23:38.274
Has the father been named?

23:38.315 --> 23:41.694
Um... yes

23:41.861 --> 23:43.404
John walden.

23:44.780 --> 23:46.115
You know him?

23:47.199 --> 23:49.160
I did once.

23:49.410 --> 23:51.537
What is going on with you and this kid?

23:55.332 --> 23:57.334
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

24:25.905 --> 24:28.365
you getting some background
info on rick bates?

24:28.407 --> 24:29.366
I am.

24:29.450 --> 24:31.243
There was no evidence
of him on the boat,

24:31.285 --> 24:33.287
and we haven't been able
to locate the murder weapon,

24:33.329 --> 24:36.040
so I'm widening our suspect pool.

24:36.081 --> 24:39.001
All the rest of bennett's probies?

24:39.084 --> 24:41.045
Man,that is a lot of bad guys.

24:41.086 --> 24:43.047
It's incredible,isn't it?

24:43.214 --> 24:44.632
But I have a plan.

24:44.673 --> 24:46.425
I'm putting them in
order of release date.

24:46.467 --> 24:49.970
I'm red-flagging any violent criminals
or use of a. 40 caliber weapon.

24:50.012 --> 24:52.014
Take a look at this guy's probation.

24:52.306 --> 24:55.142
He's prohibited from
working at a funeral home.

24:55.184 --> 24:56.685
Necrophiliac.

24:57.228 --> 25:00.022
Sick,but probably not our guy.

25:00.064 --> 25:03.734
This guy beat his girlfriend
until she ended up in a coma. Geez.

25:03.776 --> 25:05.194
How about this guy?

25:05.277 --> 25:07.404
Kidnapped his victims
from their own home.

25:10.866 --> 25:13.744
And then he kept his victim
in the freezer for two years.

25:15.246 --> 25:18.874
Probationer gagged her
until she suffocated.

25:18.958 --> 25:20.376
Hey,wait teminua.

25:20.459 --> 25:21.585
Look at his specialty.

25:21.669 --> 25:25.214
He always took the women to a second
location before he killed them.

25:29.552 --> 25:31.595
he's my number one candidate.

25:48.362 --> 25:50.489
Our victim's name is kathleen newberry.

25:50.531 --> 25:52.116
She was abducted less than an hour ago.

25:52.158 --> 25:53.534
Neighbor called it in.

25:53.576 --> 25:54.660
It's not the guy we thought.

25:54.702 --> 25:55.619
He's back inside.

25:55.661 --> 25:57.079
He was picked up for robbery.

25:57.163 --> 26:00.666
This might be connected to
our,uh,dead probation officer.

26:00.708 --> 26:02.126
I'm listening,frank.

26:02.168 --> 26:05.129
Well,her husband's a
guard at west dade jail.

26:05.212 --> 26:07.173
So,you're thinking maybe inmate revenge?

26:07.214 --> 26:07.965
Maybe.

26:08.007 --> 26:10.718
The P.O. And this guard have
a lot of ex-cons in common.

26:10.760 --> 26:11.469
Where's my wife?

26:11.510 --> 26:12.678
Daddy!

26:12.720 --> 26:14.263
Hey. How you doing?

26:17.099 --> 26:19.685
You stay with that,and I'll
stay with the husband,okay?

26:19.727 --> 26:20.519
All right.

26:22.563 --> 26:25.649
mr. Newberry,I'd like
a word with you,please.

26:25.691 --> 26:28.611
The officer will take the boy. ok?

26:28.652 --> 26:29.904
Right over here.

26:36.035 --> 26:37.453
you know,working with criminals,

26:37.495 --> 26:41.499
I was always afraid something
like this would happen.

26:41.540 --> 26:44.919
You know,inmates- they
threaten me all the time.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.296
You never requested protection.

26:47.421 --> 26:50.257
- There's not enough money in the county to...
- hang on a second.

26:50.508 --> 26:52.259
Is that her number?

26:53.052 --> 26:54.136
Yeah,that's her.

26:54.220 --> 26:57.264
Hang on. Wait. Wait.

26:57.807 --> 26:58.974
Answer it.

27:01.519 --> 27:02.645
hello?

27:02.770 --> 27:04.396
Mike. Oh,my god.

27:04.438 --> 27:06.982
Honey,are you all right?

27:07.024 --> 27:08.025
He wants money,mike.

27:08.067 --> 27:09.568
A lot of money.

27:09.652 --> 27:11.028
Yeah. Don't you worry.

27:11.070 --> 27:12.530
I'm going to take care
of everything. Okay?

27:12.571 --> 27:14.448
He wants $126,000.

27:14.490 --> 27:16.367
We don't have that kind of money.

27:16.408 --> 27:17.785
Get the cash,newberry. Okay?

27:17.827 --> 27:19.411
One-two-six.

27:24.583 --> 27:25.543
Kyle?

27:25.584 --> 27:27.211
Is that you?

27:27.336 --> 27:28.379
This is lieutenant caine.

27:28.420 --> 27:31.006
I want you to stop what
you're doing right now.

27:31.048 --> 27:32.383
Yeah. You don't understand.

27:32.425 --> 27:34.468
I do understand.

27:34.510 --> 27:35.511
I really do.

27:35.553 --> 27:37.096
Yeah. Now you're starting
to sound like my P.O.

27:37.138 --> 27:38.889
This is quite different,son.

27:38.931 --> 27:39.723
Listen to me.

27:39.765 --> 27:40.975
You know what? The guard
knows where the cash is.

27:41.016 --> 27:42.143
Get it!

27:43.310 --> 27:44.645
Come on!

27:48.441 --> 27:51.527
eric,I need gps access
to kyle's ankle monitor.

27:51.569 --> 27:55.156
Send it through the radio frequency
as soon as you get it,okay?

27:55.990 --> 27:57.366
What do I... what do I do now?

27:57.408 --> 27:59.702
You need to get your story straight.

28:36.405 --> 28:37.656

28:52.588 --> 28:53.672
Ma'am?

28:53.756 --> 28:54.840
Oh,thank god.

28:54.882 --> 28:55.424
Okay.

28:55.466 --> 28:57.384
I think i broke my foot.

28:57.426 --> 28:59.303
all right,easy,easy.

28:59.345 --> 29:00.304
I think you're gonna be all right.

29:00.346 --> 29:02.139
Gonna send you to the hospital.

29:03.307 --> 29:05.142
we've got something over here.

29:08.521 --> 29:10.773
Kyle must have ripped
this off his ankle.

29:17.071 --> 29:18.405
We can't track him now.

29:18.447 --> 29:20.116
Ma'am,did he say where he was going?

29:20.157 --> 29:20.908
No.

29:20.950 --> 29:22.660
He just kept apologizing.

29:23.327 --> 29:24.787
I'm sorry.

29:26.497 --> 29:28.082
I- I didn't even...

29:30.417 --> 29:31.710
I'm just...

29:31.794 --> 29:33.003
I'm sorry.

29:34.130 --> 29:35.339
The whole thing was just so random.

29:35.423 --> 29:36.549
Even the money he demanded.

29:36.590 --> 29:38.050
$126,000,right?

29:38.092 --> 29:41.512
- It was such a random number.
- It's not a random number,ma'am.

29:41.595 --> 29:44.557
- What do you mean?
- He knew your husband had the money.

29:44.723 --> 29:46.851
Where would mike get that kind of money?

29:46.934 --> 29:48.436
Very good question.

29:48.477 --> 29:49.937
Gentlemen,please?

29:49.979 --> 29:52.148
You go with them.

29:53.441 --> 29:55.067
Eric,come here,please.

29:57.319 --> 29:59.155
H,something doesn't make sense here.

29:59.238 --> 30:01.407
Why would kyle abandon his
plan before he gets the payoff?

30:01.449 --> 30:04.452
Maybe it wasn't his plan,eric.

30:04.493 --> 30:05.661
Someone else's?

30:05.744 --> 30:07.496
Yeah,that's what it looks like.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.185
I don't know why he
mentioned me on the phone.

30:20.227 --> 30:23.397
Because,according to the
kidnapper,you have the money.

30:25.566 --> 30:27.234
Look,I didn't know he
would go after my family.

30:27.276 --> 30:28.569
What's his name?

30:28.610 --> 30:29.861
I need a name.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.989
Rick bates.

30:32.239 --> 30:33.240
I don't know who the kyle guy...

30:33.282 --> 30:34.074
forget about kyle.

30:34.116 --> 30:35.659
Tell me about rick.

30:35.742 --> 30:39.663
He was an inmate on my cell block.

30:40.706 --> 30:44.042
He was smuggling drugs into
west dade jail and I caught him.

30:44.167 --> 30:46.169
He was making a lot of money and...

30:46.420 --> 30:47.838
he didn't have anywhere to store it.

30:47.879 --> 30:50.090
But you could store it,couldn't you?

30:50.591 --> 30:51.758
Yeah.

30:53.218 --> 30:54.052
I'd get the cash out.

30:54.094 --> 30:55.762
We'd split everything 50-50.

30:55.804 --> 30:58.724
But rick got early release. Didn't he?

31:04.146 --> 31:05.898
You hear I'm getting out tomorrow?

31:06.273 --> 31:08.066
I want my half of the money.

31:08.108 --> 31:09.860
I don't think that's smart.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.236
Why don't you just hold off for a while?

31:11.278 --> 31:13.322
Just have my split ready.

31:16.742 --> 31:19.578
He got impatient,he wanted
to spend all the cash.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.914
I told him it would look suspicious.

31:21.955 --> 31:27.920
Okay,so rick had kyle kidnap your wife in
exchange for the locati oonf the money. Right?

31:27.961 --> 31:30.797
And I couldn't do that with
all the police everywhere.

31:30.839 --> 31:32.633
Where's the money now?

31:33.550 --> 31:34.843
Where is it?

31:40.974 --> 31:42.392
There it is.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.561
$126,000.

31:44.686 --> 31:46.104
- I guess it's all over now.
- Hardly.

31:46.146 --> 31:47.689
Excuse me.

31:47.856 --> 31:50.609
Bates planned the whole kidnapping
and you can't arrest him?

31:50.651 --> 31:52.361
In due time. Stay with him.

31:54.863 --> 31:56.114
We'll take that.

31:59.368 --> 31:59.952
Hey,rick.

31:59.993 --> 32:04.623
Jail guard newbury,he gave you
up,said you split the money with him.

32:04.665 --> 32:06.416
Well,the jail guard is lying.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.834
I didn't split any money with him.

32:07.876 --> 32:11.296
And I suppose you didn't put kyle up to
kidnapping the guy's wife either,right?

32:11.338 --> 32:15.217
No,I didn't,but you do have the
testimony of a crooked jail guard.

32:15.300 --> 32:17.219
That's good detective work.

32:18.345 --> 32:21.139
We still like you for
the murder of yo. P.o

32:21.765 --> 32:23.350
based on what?

32:23.392 --> 32:26.228
Based on a bullet casing
we found on your boat.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.948
If you had anything to tie me to
that,you'd have busted me already.

32:38.865 --> 32:40.325
We'll see.

32:41.368 --> 32:42.744
We'll see.

33:33.503 --> 33:34.671
Check it out.

33:34.713 --> 33:35.547
Nice.

33:35.589 --> 33:38.592
Yeah. I un-mangled it because I
thought there might be a print on it.

33:43.096 --> 33:45.265
okay,I've got my money on rick bates,

33:45.349 --> 33:48.685
'cause I think he's got all the motive in
the world to want his probation officer dead.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.646
I'm thinking the same thing.

33:52.272 --> 33:53.941
ryan wolfe?

33:55.692 --> 33:58.070
He's always stepping in it somehow.

33:58.695 --> 34:00.405
But this is bad,this is bad.

34:00.447 --> 34:01.657
Yeah,really bad.

34:01.698 --> 34:05.494
We got his prints on a
cartridge from the crime scene.

34:06.119 --> 34:08.246
I think I know how this happened.

34:08.871 --> 34:10.791
I got to get ahold of ryan.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.085
I told you,I don't even own a gun.

34:14.670 --> 34:18.047
No,you stole one and
had someone else load it.

34:20.801 --> 34:22.386
Hey there,pal.

34:24.388 --> 34:26.139
Recognize me?

34:27.933 --> 34:29.434
No.

34:30.268 --> 34:31.812
Let me help you out...

34:32.396 --> 34:34.022
refresh your memory.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.734
Ryan wolfe works at the
grovedale firing range

34:37.775 --> 34:40.946
and personally loads every
gun for each customer,

34:41.029 --> 34:44.449
which is why your prints
aren't on the cartridge.

34:53.667 --> 34:56.128
Recognize me now?

34:57.754 --> 34:59.423
Thanks for coming in.

34:59.756 --> 35:01.008
You're welcome.

35:03.427 --> 35:08.807
Look,rick,striations from your glock 24 were
found on the bullet that killed andrew bennett.

35:10.642 --> 35:12.394
Let's start talking.

35:17.232 --> 35:19.484
My P.O. Caught me dealing.

35:20.152 --> 35:22.571
I went over to ask
him to cut me a break.

35:22.946 --> 35:25.282
You've had your share
of last chances,rick.

35:25.532 --> 35:27.701
This time you're going back in.

35:30.454 --> 35:32.497
you sure you can't make an exception?

35:32.539 --> 35:34.041
Just this once?

35:34.791 --> 35:36.585
That's when the cops showed up.

36:15.082 --> 36:16.917
I needed to find a way out.

36:17.209 --> 36:19.795
There was a payday out
there with my name on it.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.256
The cash that you were
splitting with your jail guard.

36:22.297 --> 36:24.925
Yeah,splitting.

36:25.342 --> 36:26.969
He was gonna walk away with all of it.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.471
He's worse than the damn convicts.

36:30.514 --> 36:32.140
I had to remind him who was boss.

36:32.182 --> 36:35.269
By blackmailing a 16-year-old
to kidnap his wife?

36:36.144 --> 36:36.937
Dude,I'm not going to do it.

36:36.979 --> 36:38.480
I'm not going to risk
violating probation.

36:38.522 --> 36:39.982
Look,here's the deal.

36:40.023 --> 36:43.318
Either you kidnap her or I tell the
police you did yoand u serve 30 to life.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.194
They're not going to believe you.

36:44.236 --> 36:47.197
And they're gonna believe some
kid whose own mother bailed on him?

36:51.034 --> 36:53.579
So you... used a child.

36:54.830 --> 36:57.791
I'd get what I want without
getting my hands dirty.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.001
You know what?

36:59.042 --> 37:01.628
Murder,drugs,blackmail.

37:01.670 --> 37:03.672
I would say your hands were filthy.

37:03.714 --> 37:07.134
Why don't you start writing
exactly how you just told us?

37:20.272 --> 37:23.191
You found this ankle monitor
at the kidnapping scene?

37:23.358 --> 37:24.318
We did.

37:24.359 --> 37:26.028
And it belongs to kyle?

37:26.069 --> 37:27.195
That's correct.

37:27.237 --> 37:31.867
So if we already know the epithelials
are his,why am I running them?

37:32.200 --> 37:36.079
Because I want you
to compare it to this.

37:37.915 --> 37:40.751
Horatio,this is your dna profile.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.502
That's correct.

37:49.593 --> 37:52.512
Oh,my god,the suspect...

37:53.180 --> 37:54.765
he's your son.

38:04.524 --> 38:07.903
Orders on the kidnapper
are shoot to kill.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.988
What are you going to do?

38:10.822 --> 38:12.199
Find him.

38:13.784 --> 38:15.577
Are you sure the boy is your son?

38:15.619 --> 38:16.578
I am.

38:16.620 --> 38:19.539
What about the name on
the birth certificate?

38:19.581 --> 38:22.459
John walden is a cover
name I used 16 years ago.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.837
I did some special task
force work in pensacola.

38:26.797 --> 38:28.882
That's when I met julia.

38:30.300 --> 38:33.971
And this julia put it on the birth certificate
because that's the only name she knew you by.

38:34.012 --> 38:35.097
That's exactly right.

38:35.138 --> 38:38.559
She disappeared a few
months after we met.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.395
Was it serious?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.730
It was for me.

38:47.651 --> 38:50.070
And you never knew she was pregnant?

38:51.113 --> 38:52.948
Not until today.

38:57.661 --> 39:00.080
You'd make a great father,horatio.

39:06.044 --> 39:06.670
excuse me.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.005
Yeah.

39:08.589 --> 39:10.048
Where?

39:10.424 --> 39:12.134
Okay,thank you.

39:12.426 --> 39:13.677
They just found kyle.

39:13.719 --> 39:14.428
Is he hurt?

39:14.469 --> 39:16.889
He's running from the coast guard.

39:44.166 --> 39:47.252
I repeat... cut your engine immediately.

40:00.098 --> 40:00.766
Please listen to me.

40:00.807 --> 40:04.770
I need you to patch me through to commander
langdon,U.S. Coast guard,immediately!

40:06.230 --> 40:07.481
Turn off your engine.

40:07.522 --> 40:09.566
This is your last warning.

40:25.499 --> 40:26.792
Commander langdon.

40:26.833 --> 40:28.252
Commander,I need you
to trust me on this one.

40:28.293 --> 40:29.544
This kid wants a chase.

40:29.586 --> 40:30.921
Please don't give it to him,sir.

40:30.963 --> 40:32.005
Stand down.

40:32.047 --> 40:33.340
Stan,downd sir.

40:38.220 --> 40:42.224
c-6214,request you return
to base at this time.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.107
Come on!

40:56.822 --> 40:57.948
Why?

41:24.308 --> 41:26.143
Could I have a minute,gentlemen?

41:34.318 --> 41:36.737
You made a good decision out there,kyle.

41:38.196 --> 41:40.240
They told me that you were
the one who called it off.

41:40.282 --> 41:41.283
That's right.

41:41.325 --> 41:43.285
Could have been a whole lot worse.

41:43.327 --> 41:44.411
Why'd you do that?

41:44.453 --> 41:47.789
I mean,like,why do you even care?

41:52.294 --> 41:54.546
Because it's my job to care,son.

41:54.630 --> 41:56.840
Hey,I'm not your son,all right?

41:56.924 --> 41:58.342
Leave me alone.
