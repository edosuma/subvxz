WEBVTT

02:31.488 --> 02:33.616
Then the doctor.

02:35.058 --> 02:39.758
What if we compare 2016 with 1879,

02:40.330 --> 02:44.597
do you experience social injustice
in Switzerland or anywhere else?

02:44.668 --> 02:46.102
Yes, Roberto?

02:46.169 --> 02:49.196
Yes, often.
When applying for jobs, for example.

02:49.306 --> 02:51.571
If your name ends with "ic"...

02:52.042 --> 02:55.410
Have you experienced that personally?
- Yes.

02:57.013 --> 03:00.711
Yeah, loads of my friends
can't get jobs because of it.

03:01.685 --> 03:04.177
What kind of injustice is that?

03:05.155 --> 03:08.614
Because of the "ic".
- Right, the "ic". So they're...?

03:09.526 --> 03:10.516
Sorry?

03:11.027 --> 03:12.017
They're...

03:13.096 --> 03:14.564
Yugoslavian or whatever.

03:14.664 --> 03:16.530
...discriminated against.
- Yes.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.592
By other people.
- Yes.

03:18.702 --> 03:22.161
Now, let's look at the tests
we did last time.

03:36.620 --> 03:38.111
Hi.
- Hi.

03:38.221 --> 03:40.383
I'm Sophie.
- Mia.

03:40.457 --> 03:42.619
I know, we're in the same class.

03:43.727 --> 03:46.094
Why have you come
in the middle of the year?

03:46.196 --> 03:49.291
Were you being bullied?
- My father got a new job.

03:51.768 --> 03:53.760
They think they're so cool.

03:53.870 --> 03:56.499
They're always messing around in
class.

03:56.973 --> 03:58.566
So immature.

04:03.747 --> 04:05.113
Anyone got a light?

04:05.749 --> 04:07.183
What do you want?

04:07.417 --> 04:10.876
Who said you could talk to us?
- You can't smoke during recess.

04:10.954 --> 04:13.287
I don't care. Anyone got a
light?

04:15.592 --> 04:17.356
Think you're tough, do you?

04:26.936 --> 04:29.701
Hello, darling. Was it alright?
- Great.

04:36.746 --> 04:39.181
Can I come in?
- You already did.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.482
Tell me about it...

04:49.592 --> 04:51.618
are the other children nice?

04:51.695 --> 04:52.958
I think so.

04:55.465 --> 04:57.661
I realize this isn't easy for
you.

05:05.975 --> 05:08.444
Didn't you wash your hair
for your first day?

05:08.511 --> 05:09.604
Mom...

05:09.679 --> 05:11.204
Talk to me.

05:11.314 --> 05:13.783
Mom, please just get out of my
room.

05:13.850 --> 05:15.375
Don't use that tone.

05:15.485 --> 05:16.851
Get out of my room!

05:16.953 --> 05:19.218
Don't talk to me like that.
- Get out!

05:24.327 --> 05:26.193
Mom, I'm sorry.

05:26.296 --> 05:27.628
I'm sorry.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.378
Why did you do it?

05:47.984 --> 05:50.453
You can't attack your mother
like that.

05:56.326 --> 05:57.988
Answer me.

06:02.599 --> 06:04.431
Say something!

06:06.369 --> 06:09.032
You have everything, goddammit!

08:31.314 --> 08:32.679
A cycling tour.

08:32.749 --> 08:35.412
And the last suggestion...
Paris!

08:36.352 --> 08:38.514
Who said Paris? You?

08:38.587 --> 08:40.284
Paris is not an option.
- Why?

08:41.658 --> 08:44.787
The choices are:
Matterhorn, Technorama, cycling tour.

08:44.861 --> 08:46.693
We could go to Connyland.

08:47.530 --> 08:49.328
Connyland, seriously?

08:49.399 --> 08:51.732
When did you last go?
- Three years ago.

08:51.834 --> 08:53.268
Add it to the list!

08:53.536 --> 08:56.802
Isn't it for little kids?
- No, it's a cool idea, add it!

08:56.873 --> 08:58.341
You think so?

08:58.408 --> 09:01.173
We'll get high, it's gonna be
epic.

09:01.244 --> 09:02.234
Connyland!

09:03.613 --> 09:07.311
OK, we'll add Connyland to the
list.

09:10.253 --> 09:13.849
You come up first then, Bjorn,
and then everyone else.

09:16.125 --> 09:19.425
OK, cycling tour is catching up.

09:20.463 --> 09:23.126
Both are on nine.
Someone's missing.

09:26.069 --> 09:27.560
Have you voted yet?

09:28.237 --> 09:30.331
Please come up here.
- Put Connyland.

09:32.208 --> 09:34.404
Vote for Connyland, no shit.

09:40.283 --> 09:42.115
Connyland is the winner.

09:42.218 --> 09:45.814
The entertainment industry
in the pre-digital era.

09:45.888 --> 09:48.483
Have a nice weekend, see you on
Monday.

09:48.558 --> 09:49.719
Chairs on the tables!

10:00.436 --> 10:01.961
Sorry.

10:05.742 --> 10:07.711
Hey, got a smoke?

10:10.747 --> 10:12.409
Got one for me too?

10:13.116 --> 10:14.880
Can I have one too?

10:14.951 --> 10:17.978
Can I have another one?
- Yeah, me too.

10:18.087 --> 10:20.579
And one for later.
- Buy your own.

10:20.656 --> 10:23.353
We never buy our own,
only bimbos do that.

10:23.993 --> 10:25.154
Go fuck yourselves.

10:25.795 --> 10:28.321
Bimbo!
- What's her name anyway?

10:28.431 --> 10:30.297
Her name's Bimbo. No shit.

10:30.366 --> 10:31.390
What's your name?

10:33.503 --> 10:35.699
What's your name?
- What do you want?

10:35.805 --> 10:38.969
To know your name.
- You know damn well what my name is.

10:39.042 --> 10:40.476
I forgot, I swear.

10:41.444 --> 10:44.437
I'm Gianna. Nelly, Vivi.
They're our boys.

10:44.514 --> 10:47.780
Gianna, leave her alone.
- Chill, I just want to know her name.

10:48.451 --> 10:50.113
So, tell her your name.

10:51.187 --> 10:52.951
You dumb or what?

10:53.022 --> 10:54.012
Mia.

10:55.725 --> 10:57.387
OK, Mia,

10:57.493 --> 11:00.361
if you want to hang with us,
you have to be a bimbo.

11:02.498 --> 11:05.161
Everything OK?
- Are you my nanny or what?

11:08.037 --> 11:09.733
Ask if she gets periods yet.

11:10.840 --> 11:13.309
Well, do you?
- What a dumb question.

11:13.876 --> 11:17.472
Can you dance all sexy like Gianna?
- No way, she's got no ass.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.678
Right, we're off to the gym.
- Bye, guys.

11:23.219 --> 11:24.517
See you tomorrow.

11:27.890 --> 11:30.485
You really want
to hang out with us, don't you?

11:32.095 --> 11:33.256
So, come along.

11:33.763 --> 11:35.197
And relax!

11:39.936 --> 11:41.632
Fuck, my Dad's home.

12:02.859 --> 12:05.852
Don't you have school?
- Would I be here if I did?

12:17.573 --> 12:19.201
Can you sign this?

12:28.951 --> 12:30.044
Thanks.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.118
Don't look at her like that.

12:33.222 --> 12:34.815
It's disgusting.

12:34.891 --> 12:36.154
Are you nuts?

12:38.594 --> 12:39.857
You got a ciggie?

12:56.012 --> 12:59.813
Get down lower.
- OK, you're better than me.

13:04.420 --> 13:07.117
Who are you writing to?
- Nobody.

13:07.190 --> 13:08.488
Did he write to you?

13:08.591 --> 13:09.581
No.

13:10.126 --> 13:11.924
Why write to him then?

13:12.862 --> 13:14.990
I'm pretending it was meant for
you.

13:15.097 --> 13:16.963
You're so running after him.

13:18.267 --> 13:20.031
Gianna, what are you doing?

13:20.836 --> 13:24.329
Whose legs are these? They're not shaved.
- They are!

13:31.147 --> 13:34.276
Jim went down on me.
- What? When?

13:35.551 --> 13:37.986
He has no idea what he's doing.

13:38.054 --> 13:40.387
He's crazy about you!
- His problem.

13:40.489 --> 13:43.584
Maybe I'll fuck him
if he's better at going down on me.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.088
Give me the laptop.

13:49.732 --> 13:51.257
Open your mouth.

13:57.039 --> 13:59.201
You're such babies.

13:59.308 --> 14:00.674
Watch this.

14:08.651 --> 14:11.746
Look at her!
- She's never seen it before.

14:15.091 --> 14:17.583
So, Mia, you got a boyfriend?

14:17.693 --> 14:18.820
No.

14:18.894 --> 14:21.557
Ever had one?
- Sure, a few.

14:21.664 --> 14:24.634
You haven't bounced yet,
I can see that a mile off.

14:24.700 --> 14:29.297
Which of our guys do you like?
- Roberto? I saw a spark.

14:29.372 --> 14:32.638
I prefer older guys.
- 18 and up? I understand.

14:33.042 --> 14:34.806
And what kind of guy?

14:36.445 --> 14:39.074
Taller than me, and I find
tattoos sexy.

14:40.249 --> 14:42.878
"I find tattoos sexy." Hair
color?

14:43.419 --> 14:44.887
Don't care.

14:44.954 --> 14:47.321
"Hair color and appearance:
any."

14:47.423 --> 14:49.289
No, he still has to look good.

14:50.192 --> 14:53.526
OK, I'll delete "appearance".
Now we just need a pic.

14:56.299 --> 14:58.234
Look into the light.
- Look sexy.

14:58.301 --> 15:00.964
The light's here.
- Further up, pout.

15:01.470 --> 15:03.268
Pout more.

15:03.372 --> 15:05.739
Show your cheekbones.

15:09.145 --> 15:10.272
Now topless.

15:12.415 --> 15:13.110
No.

15:15.251 --> 15:18.779
You then!
- No, I'm not getting topless.

15:18.888 --> 15:19.912
Take it off.

15:22.291 --> 15:23.987
Stop it, Gianna. No!

15:24.760 --> 15:27.889
Gianna!
- Chill! You do it to me then.

15:27.963 --> 15:29.329
No!
- Do it to me.

15:29.432 --> 15:31.765
Stop this shit.
- What's wrong with you?

15:31.834 --> 15:34.269
What's wrong?
- We're not doing that again.

15:34.337 --> 15:36.829
Nothing can go wrong!
- Quit that shit.

15:36.939 --> 15:38.771
What do you want to do?

15:38.841 --> 15:40.309
Come here.

15:41.944 --> 15:43.139
Shut up.

15:47.249 --> 15:50.117
When I stand up,
squeeze my throat tight, OK?

15:59.362 --> 16:00.455
Harder.

16:03.432 --> 16:04.525
Harder.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.053
Nice.

16:42.405 --> 16:46.240
Try it for yourself before you say no,
it feels so nice.

16:46.342 --> 16:47.537
No, thanks.

16:47.643 --> 16:48.804
I want to try.

17:54.376 --> 17:56.140
I have to go home.

19:03.178 --> 19:04.202
Hello?

19:12.154 --> 19:13.144
Mia?

19:15.691 --> 19:17.660
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

19:18.394 --> 19:20.386
Are you sick?
- No.

19:20.896 --> 19:22.865
It sounded that way.
- No.

20:21.390 --> 20:22.722
Where are you going?

20:22.791 --> 20:24.123
To school.

20:25.728 --> 20:27.663
Can you sign this?

20:27.730 --> 20:29.665
What is it?

20:29.732 --> 20:33.931
We're going to Connyland with school.
- Sure, put it down there.

20:38.574 --> 20:40.099
Bye, take care.

21:13.676 --> 21:15.008
Where are you going?

21:16.845 --> 21:18.677
Wait! What are you up to?

21:19.982 --> 21:21.610
We're going shopping.

21:31.026 --> 21:33.723
Fuck, how does this shit work?

21:33.829 --> 21:36.264
You just piss on it.
- Oh no, really?

21:58.053 --> 21:59.544
It will be fine.

22:08.997 --> 22:10.863
It's negative! It's negative!

22:21.710 --> 22:22.803
Fuck!

22:23.812 --> 22:24.802
Guys...

22:28.150 --> 22:29.482
You son of a bitch!

22:30.052 --> 22:32.886
Fuck you and your bitch too!

22:34.323 --> 22:37.919
Hey, look at her, she's so ugly.

22:37.993 --> 22:42.021
Then look at yourself,
you deserve better than him, hun.

23:39.721 --> 23:41.349
Hey, stop!
- Run!

24:27.302 --> 24:29.430
Hello!

24:56.498 --> 24:58.990
Where did you go?
- We had to get out.

24:59.067 --> 25:00.695
That was so crazy.

25:02.037 --> 25:03.369
Let's go.

25:44.846 --> 25:46.712
YOU WANNA MEET UP?

27:39.161 --> 27:39.924
Mia?

27:40.862 --> 27:42.558
Why did you lock the door?

27:45.967 --> 27:49.062
Jacky and Robby
aren't in the aquarium anymore.

27:50.839 --> 27:52.467
Open up.

27:53.675 --> 27:56.839
Do you know anything?
- No, why should I?

27:57.412 --> 28:00.211
Two fish don't just vanish like
that.

28:01.850 --> 28:04.149
What's going on here, dammit?

28:05.220 --> 28:06.882
What happened to those fish?

28:10.692 --> 28:12.661
I flushed them down the toilet.

28:16.031 --> 28:16.999
Why?

29:18.727 --> 29:20.662
Wakey wakey, sleepyhead.

29:22.397 --> 29:24.423
I'll give you a lift.

29:41.249 --> 29:42.615
So...

29:42.684 --> 29:44.050
how's school going?

29:44.653 --> 29:45.484
Good.

29:48.523 --> 29:50.458
What about in class?

29:50.525 --> 29:52.460
Are you keeping up?

29:52.527 --> 29:54.723
I passed the last math test.

29:59.935 --> 30:02.700
Why did you flush Mom's fish
down the toilet?

30:08.510 --> 30:11.002
You know you're out of line,
don't you?

30:12.647 --> 30:14.639
You know it's not on, don't you?

30:15.383 --> 30:16.578
Yeah...

30:16.685 --> 30:18.620
So why did you do it?

30:20.956 --> 30:21.980
I don't know.

30:22.958 --> 30:24.256
For God's sake.

30:26.394 --> 30:29.330
You can forget about Connyland
right away.

30:49.918 --> 30:51.784
SIHL CITY MEDICAL CENTER

31:00.562 --> 31:02.360
Hello, Mia?

31:02.430 --> 31:03.523
Dr. Mundweiler.

31:07.869 --> 31:11.306
Is there anything particular
that brought you here?

31:12.774 --> 31:15.209
An examination, could you do
that?

31:16.011 --> 31:18.310
What kind of examination do you
want?

31:18.380 --> 31:21.544
Just to check that everything's
alright.

31:21.616 --> 31:23.551
Yes, I can certainly do that.

31:24.185 --> 31:26.313
Mia, you can talk openly to me.

31:27.455 --> 31:30.118
Do you feel something's wrong?

31:31.926 --> 31:33.758
No, I'm fine, sorry.

31:42.637 --> 31:46.267
It's just that... I got my
period.

31:46.374 --> 31:48.468
For the first time?
- Yep.

31:48.543 --> 31:50.478
When?
- Yesterday.

31:50.545 --> 31:51.740
That's nice.

31:51.813 --> 31:54.180
You will of course go through
changes now.

31:54.282 --> 31:55.910
Is it painful?

31:55.984 --> 31:58.010
No, I've just felt different.

31:59.654 --> 32:01.179
Come and sit down again.

32:11.566 --> 32:15.059
Is it different than you expected?
Did it catch you by surprise?

32:15.136 --> 32:16.661
No, it's not that.

32:17.272 --> 32:18.740
It's my feet.

32:19.808 --> 32:21.333
What about your feet?

32:23.678 --> 32:25.704
My toes have grown together.

32:25.814 --> 32:27.282
Your toes?

32:28.983 --> 32:31.452
This isn't really my field.

32:31.519 --> 32:34.284
But it's happened since I got my
period.

32:38.460 --> 32:40.292
Alright, let me take a look.

32:42.130 --> 32:44.827
It's syndactyly. It's not
dangerous.

32:45.166 --> 32:47.499
It can easily be surgically
removed.

32:47.602 --> 32:49.571
Cool. Can you do it right now?

32:49.637 --> 32:53.301
If you see a pediatrician,
they'll send you to an orthopedic surgeon.

32:53.375 --> 32:55.742
And then it'll look the same as
before?

32:55.844 --> 32:57.813
What do you mean by "before"?

32:57.879 --> 33:01.509
I mean normal.
- Syndactyly is a birth defect.

33:01.616 --> 33:05.610
You've had it since you were born.
- I've only had it since yesterday.

33:05.687 --> 33:07.053
That's not possible.

33:07.155 --> 33:10.250
It is! Do you think I'm deformed?
Just get rid of it!

33:12.293 --> 33:13.989
May I take another look?

33:26.641 --> 33:30.271
There's another thin membrane
between the other toes.

33:32.414 --> 33:34.440
This is really very
extraordinary.

33:35.717 --> 33:38.346
We could do some lab tests.
You can get up now.

33:38.420 --> 33:41.185
Does anybody else
in your family have this?

33:43.858 --> 33:45.793
You're going to feel a prick.

33:51.566 --> 33:52.659
Alright?

36:09.037 --> 36:13.304
Why aren't there any photos of you
when you were pregnant with me?

36:13.374 --> 36:16.503
They must be in one of the
boxes.

36:18.813 --> 36:19.803
And...

36:21.482 --> 36:24.145
why do I look so different from
you two?

36:28.923 --> 36:30.619
Don't you have any homework?

36:30.725 --> 36:33.718
The Gnädingers' daughter
is always studying.

36:34.762 --> 36:36.856
I do have some.
- Well then.

37:35.590 --> 37:39.254
YOU WANNA HAVE SEX?

38:13.695 --> 38:14.958
Hey, girls.

38:16.330 --> 38:18.162
I'm doing it with someone later.

38:20.501 --> 38:21.992
Is that his profile?

38:23.037 --> 38:24.335
Let me see.

38:24.939 --> 38:27.272
My God, 35 is real old.

38:27.341 --> 38:29.173
It's fine, I've been there.

38:29.277 --> 38:31.473
It means he has lots of
experience.

38:47.295 --> 38:49.491
I'm wasting my youth on trains.

38:53.067 --> 38:56.094
How much longer is it?
- About ten minutes.

38:56.204 --> 38:57.536
It's so hot.

38:58.740 --> 39:00.936
Ask Mia how much longer it is.

39:07.415 --> 39:09.247
You're really doing this?

39:09.350 --> 39:11.114
Yeah, why?

39:11.185 --> 39:12.517
It's crazy.

39:12.587 --> 39:15.853
Just don't let him
take pictures or shit like that.

39:15.923 --> 39:16.856
Here.

39:43.551 --> 39:45.577
You aren't really 16, are you?

39:46.120 --> 39:48.055
I'm 16 the day after tomorrow.

39:48.589 --> 39:49.955
So you cheated a bit.

39:50.925 --> 39:52.393
Does that bother you?

39:52.960 --> 39:54.792
No. It's fine.

39:57.298 --> 40:00.166
Or am I too old for you?
- No, not at all.

40:01.736 --> 40:03.500
I'm not so young anymore.

40:04.305 --> 40:06.069
It all happens so fast,

40:06.741 --> 40:08.903
you're too young to even imagine
it.

40:12.914 --> 40:14.780
It's a lovely day today.

40:18.619 --> 40:21.088
Don't you want
to be out with your friends?

40:21.155 --> 40:23.590
No, what about you?

40:30.832 --> 40:32.767
It's lovely that you're here.

40:39.640 --> 40:41.836
You want to hear my favorite
song?

41:24.619 --> 41:26.781
I really do like you a lot.

41:29.323 --> 41:31.189
No, seriously,

41:31.292 --> 41:33.056
you're really beautiful.

41:35.830 --> 41:37.628
Stick your tongue out.

41:41.502 --> 41:42.993
Again.

41:46.407 --> 41:49.104
Wow, it makes you even more
beautiful.

41:51.212 --> 41:52.407
Lie down.

42:15.236 --> 42:17.671
What's that? Did someone hit
you?

42:22.510 --> 42:24.536
Hey, everything's OK.
- No!

42:27.014 --> 42:27.879
I'm sorry.

42:41.462 --> 42:43.090
Where are you going?

42:47.034 --> 42:48.866
Did you do it?

42:50.871 --> 42:53.363
Come on, let's go.
- Wait a second.

42:53.441 --> 42:54.966
Did you do it?

42:57.979 --> 42:59.140
Let's go.

42:59.246 --> 43:00.771
Just like I said.

46:20.481 --> 46:23.315
See you later.
- Idiot, I'll be right back.

46:24.118 --> 46:25.780
Shall we go to my room?

46:41.335 --> 46:43.429
Can I ask you something?

46:43.504 --> 46:44.369
Yes.

46:45.839 --> 46:47.501
Do you want something from me?

46:48.976 --> 46:50.842
What should I want?

46:57.218 --> 46:59.016
Ever had a smoke kiss?

47:06.894 --> 47:09.022
Just suck it into your lungs.

47:22.142 --> 47:23.838
You wanna bounce?

47:26.680 --> 47:28.706
I always wanted to do it with
you.

47:29.250 --> 47:30.377
But...

47:30.484 --> 47:34.421
if you don't want to,
I can play video games with my brother.

47:49.903 --> 47:50.927
Shit,

47:52.506 --> 47:54.270
you're driving me crazy.

48:00.881 --> 48:02.406
That was great.

48:02.516 --> 48:04.712
Did you come?
- I think so.

48:06.954 --> 48:10.914
You wanna stay to play some video games?
- No, I have to go home.

48:12.192 --> 48:14.024
OK with you if I go?

48:27.141 --> 48:29.804
There's a party tonight, you
wanna come?

48:33.914 --> 48:35.280
See you there.

51:10.103 --> 51:11.594
How's it going?

51:14.942 --> 51:16.638
Hi, guys.
- This is Mia.

51:16.743 --> 51:17.767
Alex.

51:19.112 --> 51:20.876
Jim.
- Give her some.

51:21.748 --> 51:22.772
Thanks.

51:27.454 --> 51:30.447
Are you two going out?
- No, we're just friends.

51:31.158 --> 51:32.990
Now he knows her inside and out.

51:33.894 --> 51:35.487
Shut it!
- You two bounced?

51:35.562 --> 51:37.053
Let's go get a beer.

51:37.130 --> 51:38.325
You cool bitch.

51:38.432 --> 51:40.958
You two are together?
- I dunno.

51:41.068 --> 51:42.593
Are you in love?

51:50.978 --> 51:52.640
Can I have a swig?

51:53.480 --> 51:54.641
Is it hardcore?

51:57.284 --> 51:59.879
Anyone got a light?

52:00.921 --> 52:02.446
Oh, sorry!

52:06.827 --> 52:08.625
Smoking a doobie...

52:08.695 --> 52:10.561
Cool, chill.

52:11.198 --> 52:12.826
Have a good night, yeah?

53:18.365 --> 53:19.856
You alright?

53:21.401 --> 53:22.733
You drunk?

53:23.437 --> 53:25.429
A bit.
- Me too.

53:26.707 --> 53:28.676
You wanna do it with me too?

53:29.876 --> 53:31.003
Maybe.

53:32.079 --> 53:33.945
Take it easy, I'll call you.

53:51.198 --> 53:53.326
Everything's fine.

53:54.368 --> 53:56.701
Everything's cool.
- Yeah?

53:57.904 --> 53:59.668
I'm feeling great.

54:02.943 --> 54:05.276
Everything out, get it all out.

54:09.316 --> 54:11.148
You want to sit down?

54:20.594 --> 54:22.358
I have to get home now.

54:25.766 --> 54:27.530
Can I sleep at your place?

54:28.435 --> 54:29.562
Sure.

54:58.999 --> 55:00.991
Where's your mom?
- Asleep.

55:01.101 --> 55:04.071
Your parents don't sleep
in the same bed anymore?

55:05.639 --> 55:08.006
And your mom always does the
cooking?

55:08.642 --> 55:09.769
Yes.

55:09.843 --> 55:11.778
Perfect family, huh?

55:12.813 --> 55:13.906
Yes.

55:14.514 --> 55:17.040
Sometimes I get the feeling I'm
adopted.

55:17.150 --> 55:18.641
Wow, really?

55:19.553 --> 55:21.920
So who could your real mother
be?

55:23.356 --> 55:25.291
Someone who didn't want me.

55:27.561 --> 55:28.654
Fuck.

55:29.996 --> 55:31.794
Just like with me.

55:34.000 --> 55:37.368
My mom went to the US
after the divorce.

55:39.539 --> 55:42.703
She said she just
had to arrange a few things,

55:43.310 --> 55:44.903
then I could join her.

55:46.680 --> 55:49.377
She's been saying that for five
years now.

55:50.050 --> 55:51.040
Shit.

55:51.718 --> 55:54.210
And your father?
- You've seen him.

55:55.155 --> 55:58.648
But he's never home,
so I can do whatever I want.

55:59.493 --> 56:01.519
I wish I could do whatever I
want.

56:03.029 --> 56:06.193
I can't even go to Connyland.
- What? Why not?

56:06.833 --> 56:07.960
No idea.

56:08.535 --> 56:11.562
Are you kidding? You have to
come!

56:11.671 --> 56:14.698
Where's the letter for your parents?
- On the desk.

56:17.544 --> 56:19.342
What's your dad's first name?

56:19.412 --> 56:22.940
Michael. But you can't fake his
signature.

56:24.351 --> 56:28.118
You think Eric spends his evenings
comparing signatures?

56:35.462 --> 56:37.954
You do it, it looks cool.

56:39.766 --> 56:41.928
Show me your belly button.

56:42.035 --> 56:44.698
Your belly button is real cute!

56:46.740 --> 56:47.708
Fuck you!

56:59.219 --> 57:00.243
Morning.

57:00.320 --> 57:01.447
Morning.
- Morning.

57:02.155 --> 57:05.922
We've been invited
to the Stockers' wedding. You too.

57:05.992 --> 57:09.485
There's a spa there,
and there'll be other kids too.

57:10.163 --> 57:11.859
I don't feel like going.

57:14.935 --> 57:17.131
Hello.

57:17.237 --> 57:19.365
Morning, Mrs. Lehner.
- Good morning.

57:19.439 --> 57:21.408
Mr. Lehner.
- Hello. And you are?

57:21.474 --> 57:23.841
Gianna, pleased to meet you.

57:23.944 --> 57:26.277
Thanks for letting me stay the
night.

57:26.346 --> 57:27.939
Yes, of course.

57:28.682 --> 57:31.015
Are you in the same class?
- We are.

57:31.117 --> 57:34.417
Do your parents know you slept here?
- They don't give a shit.

57:35.455 --> 57:38.823
Do you happen to have a toothbrush for me?
- Of course.

57:39.426 --> 57:40.621
Thanks.

57:46.933 --> 57:49.801
I stopped smoking.
- Cool.

57:49.870 --> 57:50.997
Piss off.

57:51.104 --> 57:52.436
Mia, come down here!

57:52.939 --> 57:54.805
When did you stop smoking?

57:54.875 --> 57:58.505
Three hours ago or something.
- It seems ages already!

57:59.546 --> 58:03.313
Quiet please.
I need the forms signed by your parents.

58:03.383 --> 58:05.682
Where's yours, Roberto? Thank
you.

58:22.569 --> 58:23.832
What's up?

58:23.904 --> 58:25.839
We forged the signature.

58:26.806 --> 58:28.672
He won't realize.

58:32.913 --> 58:35.747
Look what I have... MDMA!

58:35.849 --> 58:37.545
What's that?
- It's so cool.

58:37.651 --> 58:39.279
It's my favorite drug.

58:44.024 --> 58:45.117
Put it all in.

58:50.664 --> 58:52.030
What now?

59:03.176 --> 59:05.509
Hey, that's enough!

59:05.578 --> 59:06.671
Too much!

59:11.418 --> 59:15.116
What would he be doing in
Connyland?

59:16.022 --> 59:19.515
Why would he be here today?

59:20.527 --> 59:22.689
Gianna, he's definitely not
here.

59:22.762 --> 59:26.597
Yeah, I'm just messing with you.

01:00:19.619 --> 01:00:20.951
Wait.

01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:22.216
Keep going!

01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:24.719
Keep going!

01:00:26.092 --> 01:00:28.357
You alright? What's up with you?

01:00:29.362 --> 01:00:30.386
Nothing.

01:00:41.274 --> 01:00:43.573
Do you just do it with anyone?

01:00:44.477 --> 01:00:46.139
You're a total slut.

01:02:42.462 --> 01:02:44.090
What's with your legs?

01:02:49.068 --> 01:02:51.230
Fuck, she puked.

01:02:51.304 --> 01:02:53.296
You have to drink water, baby.

01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:56.604
She got undressed
and her legs are full of bruises.

01:03:37.450 --> 01:03:39.385
28 MISSED CALLS
MOM

01:04:17.757 --> 01:04:19.385
Sit down.

01:04:28.201 --> 01:04:30.193
What are you playing at?

01:04:30.937 --> 01:04:33.133
Did you think we wouldn't find
out?

01:04:35.241 --> 01:04:39.576
Do you know how lame it is
if everyone can go except the new girl?

01:04:40.079 --> 01:04:43.049
For as long as you live here,
you stick to our rules.

01:04:47.854 --> 01:04:49.652
Just talk to us.

01:04:58.064 --> 01:04:59.589
Listen, Mia.

01:05:00.533 --> 01:05:02.900
We had a little talk earlier
today,

01:05:04.070 --> 01:05:05.766
and we both think

01:05:06.439 --> 01:05:08.931
you should start therapy again.

01:05:17.583 --> 01:05:19.245
I'm tired.

01:06:51.511 --> 01:06:53.673
We're going to make an incision
here.

01:06:53.746 --> 01:06:55.772
You can use the forceps.

01:06:56.649 --> 01:07:00.177
Now you can remove the flesh on
the side.

01:07:06.092 --> 01:07:08.618
Which part is the fish's swim
bladder?

01:07:10.663 --> 01:07:13.929
It's the white thing here, you
see it?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.696
You can take it out now.

01:07:21.541 --> 01:07:23.407
Why does a fish have a swim
bladder?

01:07:23.709 --> 01:07:25.405
To swim and blabber?

01:07:26.579 --> 01:07:29.674
Yes?
- So it can dive up and down.

01:07:29.749 --> 01:07:33.880
To regulate its depth.
- Right. To regulate depth when swimming.

01:07:33.953 --> 01:07:36.548
Now, what's this here, Mia?

01:07:37.623 --> 01:07:41.116
The intestine.
- That's right, you can remove it too.

01:07:47.366 --> 01:07:50.393
OK, please take
your certificates with you.

01:07:50.470 --> 01:07:52.939
Mia, you can take the fish to
Mr. Kunz,

01:07:53.039 --> 01:07:55.838
and please be on time after the
holidays.

01:08:33.779 --> 01:08:37.272
Don't you dare tell anybody,
or else I'll destroy you.

01:09:06.712 --> 01:09:09.078
One question: are you clean?

01:09:10.149 --> 01:09:11.947
What? Why?

01:09:12.018 --> 01:09:15.216
There's a rumor going around
that you're sick.

01:09:15.321 --> 01:09:17.313
Some sort of rash, I heard.

01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:19.652
It's not true.

01:09:19.725 --> 01:09:23.354
So you're not sick?
You haven't infected me with anything?

01:09:23.462 --> 01:09:25.430
No. What about you?

01:09:25.497 --> 01:09:27.194
I'm clean, sure.

01:09:35.241 --> 01:09:38.609
Daddy would be happy
if you came with us to the wedding.

01:09:38.711 --> 01:09:40.907
I don't know anybody there.

01:09:41.013 --> 01:09:42.640
It's his new boss.

01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:45.081
It would be important for us.

01:09:49.322 --> 01:09:51.348
Aren't you going to give me a
kiss?

01:10:00.066 --> 01:10:04.902
Why do you think your parents feel
it's a good idea for you to come here?

01:10:07.006 --> 01:10:09.100
Who says they're my parents?

01:10:11.544 --> 01:10:13.308
Who else would they be?

01:10:15.948 --> 01:10:17.974
Maybe they adopted me.

01:10:20.052 --> 01:10:23.216
Is that something
that's been bothering you lately?

01:10:28.094 --> 01:10:30.359
What's getting you down at the
moment?

01:10:30.863 --> 01:10:33.059
It's just all different. And...

01:10:33.699 --> 01:10:36.567
I do things I don't want to,
it doesn't feel like me.

01:10:39.205 --> 01:10:41.640
It certainly can't be easy for
you.

01:10:42.975 --> 01:10:45.740
But you're not alone.
- No! I'm not normal!

01:10:46.479 --> 01:10:51.247
And my real parents weren't normal either,
I've inherited it from them.

01:10:51.317 --> 01:10:54.082
What is it
that you've inherited from them?

01:10:56.722 --> 01:10:58.054
Can I go please?

01:11:03.062 --> 01:11:05.224
Wow, look.

01:11:05.731 --> 01:11:07.063
Put it back!

01:11:07.133 --> 01:11:08.829
Is your mom in the menopause?

01:11:10.002 --> 01:11:11.436
What's that?

01:11:11.504 --> 01:11:14.997
Hormones, so you don't
change during menopause.

01:11:15.107 --> 01:11:17.872
Appetite suppressants and
benzos...

01:11:17.943 --> 01:11:19.104
they're great.

01:11:33.459 --> 01:11:35.451
Can you read this?

01:11:36.996 --> 01:11:38.794
It's all in French.

01:11:45.705 --> 01:11:48.140
Maybe it's the adoption papers.

01:11:48.207 --> 01:11:49.800
What's this?

01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:51.673
Are you crazy?

01:11:52.511 --> 01:11:55.276
Out, both of you!
- We were just looking for something.

01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:57.980
You can go home now.
- She's staying.

01:11:58.050 --> 01:11:59.916
She's going home.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:03.813
Come to my place if it gets too
much.

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:13.996
Behind my back, what are you
playing at?

01:12:14.066 --> 01:12:16.558
There's not one photo of you
pregnant.

01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:18.865
I want to know who my real
mother is!

01:12:21.507 --> 01:12:24.341
I sometimes can't believe
you're my daughter either.

01:12:49.735 --> 01:12:50.930
Morning.

01:12:51.837 --> 01:12:53.100
Morning.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.568
Here's the address of our hotel.

01:12:57.343 --> 01:12:58.868
Give us a call.

01:14:31.537 --> 01:14:34.564
TONIGHT AT THE LAKE- YOU
COMING?

01:14:34.673 --> 01:14:35.641
YES.

01:15:08.974 --> 01:15:10.465
Mia, hello.

01:15:31.664 --> 01:15:33.496
Sexy bitch.

01:15:43.342 --> 01:15:45.334
You know what would be cool now?

01:15:49.081 --> 01:15:52.245
If we could just press pause,

01:15:52.351 --> 01:15:58.188
and everything would stay
the way it is here and now forever.

01:15:58.857 --> 01:16:00.792
That would be so cool.

01:16:02.094 --> 01:16:04.063
That would be really cool.

01:16:04.129 --> 01:16:05.927
It would be so cool.

01:16:22.581 --> 01:16:23.879
Sorry.

01:16:29.054 --> 01:16:31.649
A friend of mine
is having a party tomorrow.

01:16:32.157 --> 01:16:34.183
You two would fit right in.

01:17:33.819 --> 01:17:34.843
Help!

01:17:35.454 --> 01:17:36.080
Help!

01:17:38.991 --> 01:17:41.085
She didn't come back up!

01:18:41.553 --> 01:18:43.681
Thank you so much.
- I have to go.

01:18:46.592 --> 01:18:47.958
No, Mia!

01:18:50.295 --> 01:18:52.287
Where's she going?

01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:09.972
Fuck.

01:20:11.043 --> 01:20:12.909
What's that?

01:20:14.813 --> 01:20:16.145
Nothing.

01:20:20.152 --> 01:20:22.815
Fuck, you have to see a doctor!

01:20:22.888 --> 01:20:23.878
No...

01:20:24.690 --> 01:20:26.625
I already tried that.

01:20:34.199 --> 01:20:35.565
Shit.
- Just leave it.

01:20:37.002 --> 01:20:38.630
Just leave it.

01:20:38.704 --> 01:20:39.569
Fuck.

01:20:40.973 --> 01:20:43.272
Fuck off, just leave it.

01:20:45.477 --> 01:20:46.501
Go away!

01:25:31.329 --> 01:25:32.262
Mia?

01:25:37.302 --> 01:25:38.565
Fuck.

01:25:38.637 --> 01:25:42.165
Get the fuck out of this room,
got it?

01:25:43.208 --> 01:25:45.040
Mia, can you hear me?

01:25:45.143 --> 01:25:47.442
What are you doing?
- Fuck off.

01:25:47.512 --> 01:25:49.879
What are you doing?
- Mia, hello?

01:25:49.981 --> 01:25:53.577
Mia, stop this shit. You don't want this.
- I do!

01:25:53.652 --> 01:25:54.950
No, you don't!

01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:57.182
Your legs are bleeding.

01:25:57.289 --> 01:25:59.656
What's with her legs?
- You need to see a doctor.

01:25:59.724 --> 01:26:01.716
What's wrong with her legs?
- Nothing.

01:26:01.826 --> 01:26:03.590
Let's take her clothes off!

01:26:03.662 --> 01:26:05.790
No, leave her alone!
- No!

01:26:05.864 --> 01:26:07.662
Leave her alone!

01:26:07.732 --> 01:26:10.327
Get off me.
- Stay still!

01:26:15.173 --> 01:26:16.368
Fuck!

01:26:16.474 --> 01:26:18.602
What kind of freak are you?

01:26:18.677 --> 01:26:20.009
Is that contagious?

01:26:21.379 --> 01:26:23.314
Yes, it's contagious!

01:26:23.882 --> 01:26:25.646
Fuck off, all of you!

01:32:29.681 --> 01:32:31.479
Can I use your phone?

01:32:58.776 --> 01:32:59.903
Mom?

01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:03.744
Yes, I can hear you.

01:33:13.491 --> 01:33:15.187
I miss you both.

01:33:20.064 --> 01:33:25.332
Remember when you drank that punch
but didn't realize how strong it was?

01:33:26.404 --> 01:33:28.100
You were so funny.

01:33:37.682 --> 01:33:38.672
Yep.

01:33:41.119 --> 01:33:42.610
See you then.

01:33:44.422 --> 01:33:45.913
Bye, Mom.

01:34:34.972 --> 01:34:36.736
Aren't you afraid?

01:34:40.011 --> 01:34:41.980
No, I'm not afraid.

01:34:57.195 --> 01:34:59.221
There's no need to be sad.

01:35:01.265 --> 01:35:02.893
Don't be sad.

01:35:07.505 --> 01:35:10.031
Thank you for everything.
