<i>Flight 763 to Istanbul

01:02.262 --> 01:04.572
<i>Passengers who do not yet
have a seat assignment</i>

01:04.730 --> 01:07.405
<i>should check with the agent
at Gate 39.</i>

01:18.645 --> 01:21.285
I'm so sorry, Mr. Wiley,
we've had to bump you.

01:21.448 --> 01:24.224
I can get you on the next non-stop
to Istanbul tomorrow morning.

01:24.384 --> 01:27.558
But I'm told there's a problem
with the server.

01:27.721 --> 01:30.133
- How many bags did you check?
- No baggage.

01:31.658 --> 01:34.104
Oh, here we go.
It looks like the system's back up.

01:34.261 --> 01:37.504
I see your previous reservation
was for a one-way ticket.

01:37.664 --> 01:39.464
Would you like to purchase
the return leg now?

01:39.488 --> 01:41.101
I'm not sure when I'll be back.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.770
You're in luck.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.917
A seat just opened up on a flight
with a stopover in Rome.

01:46.073 --> 01:49.987
- And it's first class.
- Done.

01:50.143 --> 01:53.454
- Gate 33, seat 1D. Enjoy your flight.
- Thank you.

02:07.260 --> 02:10.298
Mr. Wiley, we have some newlyweds
on their honeymoon

02:10.464 --> 02:12.205
who would really love
to sit together.

02:12.366 --> 02:16.212
- Would you mind changing seats?
- Sure... Holly.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.508
I'll show you to your new seat.
Right here.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.213
I'll be the attendant in First Class.

02:24.378 --> 02:26.178
Is there anything
I can get for you right now?

02:26.202 --> 02:27.943
Something to drink?
- No, I'm fine, thanks.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.395
No.

02:32.352 --> 02:35.026
No, I told Jerry to walk away.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.668
Yeah, well, sometimes, you got
to leave the money on the table.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.472
You make them think
you don't need it.

02:40.627 --> 02:42.231
Such a gentlemen, thank you.

02:42.396 --> 02:45.240
Hey, that's my Tumi
that you're sliding over.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.037
Try not to smash it.

02:48.535 --> 02:51.175
Right, basic negotiation tactics.

02:51.338 --> 02:54.342
Used to be, people dressed up to fly.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.886
Gentlemen required
to wear a jacket and tie.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.650
Not that a man
needs to wear a suit but...

02:59.813 --> 03:00.917
Charge!

03:03.250 --> 03:08.097
Holly? On second thought,
scotch rocks would be great.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.235
No problem.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.737
Don't worry about that.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.706
Of course,
Jerry's gonna listen to me.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.503
Because Jerry always listens to me.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.340
<i>A victory for the FBI today</i>

03:22.502 --> 03:25.176
<i>as they busted a major online
drug market.</i>

03:30.510 --> 03:32.012
Sir, the forward door
has been closed.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.579
You'll need to turn off your phone.

03:33.680 --> 03:36.749
One sec.
Listen, sweetheart...

03:36.750 --> 03:39.390
...if you ever bother
to pick up a scientific journal,

03:39.553 --> 03:41.897
you'd know that all this electronic
interference stuff

03:42.055 --> 03:43.625
is really just a bunch of BS.

03:43.790 --> 03:45.701
So why don't you hop yourself
back up there

03:45.859 --> 03:48.703
and tell them that we can go
while I take my call?

03:50.263 --> 03:52.140
Okay-

03:52.299 --> 03:54.745
Sorry, Frank,
some idiot stewardess.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.903
Mind giving me a hand here, Carlos?

03:57.070 --> 04:01.143
Sorry, got my hands full with coach.
You wanted first, remember?

04:07.047 --> 04:08.958
Excuse me, sir...

04:09.583 --> 04:10.584
Oh.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.891
Looks like he talked himself out.
Bet he could use a blanket.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.560
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we have reached 10,000 feet.</i>

04:18.725 --> 04:21.672
<i>It is now safe to use
all approved electronic devices.</i>

04:56.963 --> 04:58.636
Got to hit the head.

05:07.507 --> 05:09.714
Did you need something, Mr. Wiley?

05:10.944 --> 05:12.480
Just stretching my legs.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.879
Guy's been in there a while.
Might wanna try the one in back.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.965
- Yes?
<i>- Finch?</i>

06:29.122 --> 06:33.628
Mr. Reese, where are you?
And why are you calling over VolP?

06:33.793 --> 06:36.569
You tell me.
You're the one who put me here.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.404
- <i>We can't keep doing this, Finch.</i>
- Put you where? Doing what?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.069
Overbooking my flight,
changing my seat.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.578
Are you on a plane?

06:43.737 --> 06:46.581
With two federal marshals
and their transport.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.586
I told you.
No more missions, no more numbers.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.624
While I don't agree
with your decision to leave,

06:52.648 --> 06:54.184
I certainly respect it.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.461
I did not send you on a mission,
Mr. Reese.

07:02.722 --> 07:04.463
Then who put me on this flight?

07:28.848 --> 07:31.419
An incapacitated marshal
with a missing weapon?

07:31.584 --> 07:33.825
That definitely does not look good,
Mr. Reese.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.467
It definitely doesn't look like
a coincidence either.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.296
<i>You're telling me
you didn't get a number?</i>

07:38.458 --> 07:40.836
I didn't. Believe me
when I tell you, Mr. Reese,

07:40.994 --> 07:42.871
I did not put you
in your current predicament.

07:43.029 --> 07:46.374
- Why else would I be on this plane?
<i>- I</i> can only hazard a guess.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.373
You're there
because The Machine put you there.

07:48.501 --> 07:51.778
<i>Guess your machine didn't get
my letter of resignation, Harold.</i>

07:51.938 --> 07:54.942
Give it a message for me, will you?
I quit.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.486
Message received, Mr. Reese.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.524
But what do you plan to do about the
unconscious marshal in the lavatory?

08:00.613 --> 08:02.115
That's not my problem.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.661
A loose firearm in a plane
full of civilians most certainly is.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.899
You said there were two marshals.
Where's the second?

08:09.456 --> 08:10.776
Keeping an eye on their transport

08:10.790 --> 08:13.669
Guy's sitting in 4C,
the same seat The Machine sent me.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.398
It appears there may be an accessory
on that flight,

08:16.563 --> 08:18.702
one who is now armed.
I don't suppose you are too?

08:18.865 --> 08:20.173
Even if I were, I wouldn't risk

08:20.333 --> 08:21.971
firing a weapon
on a commercial flight.

08:22.135 --> 08:24.843
<i>Bullet hits a window,
plane will depressurize in seconds.</i>

08:25.005 --> 08:26.725
So how do you plan
to control the situation?

08:26.873 --> 08:30.082
I don't.
Because I'm not accepting the mission.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.491
<i>I'll tell the marshal
what happened to his co-worker.</i>

08:33.515 --> 08:37.224
Whatever happens next is his problem,
not mine.

08:39.586 --> 08:43.260
- Move it, buddy.
- Titus, come here.

08:49.529 --> 08:53.204
I don't know who this guy is you're
transporting or what he's done...

08:53.366 --> 08:54.936
Hey, what I've allegedly done.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.830
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to
refrain from engaging with this man.

08:58.854 --> 09:00.275
I'm sorry.
He engaged with me.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.943
No, I corrected you.
There's a difference.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.082
Your partner's out cold
in the forward latrine

09:07.247 --> 09:08.453
and his weapons missing.

09:08.615 --> 09:11.721
Someone may be trying to help
your transport here escape.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.458
What's with the conspiracy theories,
Mr. Dark and Stormy?

09:15.622 --> 09:17.465
I am not trying to escape.

09:17.624 --> 09:21.128
Okay, as much as I love sucking
in this re-circulated MRSA air,

09:21.294 --> 09:23.570
- there is nothing I...
- Quiet.

09:23.730 --> 09:27.610
Look, I don't know who you are
or if you're trying to pull something

09:27.767 --> 09:29.207
but I know this isn't your business.

09:29.231 --> 09:33.236
I need you to get your ass up
and return to your seat, immediately.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.418
You're right.

09:36.142 --> 09:38.213
This isn't any of my business.

09:39.946 --> 09:41.653
Have a nice day, Marshal.

09:59.065 --> 10:03.514
Got a message for you, <i>canalla.</i>
Raphael sends his regards.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.481
Agh! He just stabbed me.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.658
Is he...?

10:18.585 --> 10:21.293
Drugged. He'll live.
Here.

10:32.599 --> 10:33.703
"Lanceros."

10:33.867 --> 10:36.006
Everything all right here?

10:36.169 --> 10:39.707
Oh, must've mixed
his anxiety meds with his booze.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.614
Probably dehydrated.

10:41.774 --> 10:46.484
- He'll sleep it off.
- And the marshal is dehydrated too?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.684
Hard for some people to stay awake
on a red-eye.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.192
Wish I had that problem.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.991
- Do you have any more blankets?
- Sure.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.725
And a couple of whiskeys, neat.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.677
Sure, just throw him over there.

11:08.468 --> 11:11.142
Hey, don't take this the wrong way
but who the hell are you?

11:11.304 --> 11:13.079
A concerned frequent flyer.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.809
Here you go.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.515
Thank you, Holly.

11:19.479 --> 11:24.258
- I owe you an apology.
- Owen. Owen Matthews.

11:24.417 --> 11:27.398
- You weren't trying to escape.
- What tipped you off?

11:27.554 --> 11:29.261
Was it my word
or the violent psychopath

11:29.422 --> 11:31.925
who stabbed me with a syringe?

11:32.091 --> 11:35.004
It's a coagulant,
to trigger a pulmonary embolism.

11:35.161 --> 11:38.574
He wanted to make your death
look like deep vein thrombosis.

11:38.731 --> 11:42.440
Natural causes.
He's a pro.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.206
You seem really sure of that.

11:44.370 --> 11:48.011
That's what I would've done
on a plane anyway.

11:48.174 --> 11:51.121
Here, drink these.
It'll thin out your blood.

11:51.277 --> 11:54.087
I don't drink hard alcohol
only red wine and in moderation.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.784
We've got eight hours
before we land this bird.

11:56.950 --> 12:00.295
Someone wants to make sure you
don't make it off this plane alive.

12:00.453 --> 12:03.627
So you might as well
have yourself a couple of drinks.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.236
Yes, Mr. Reese?

12:08.394 --> 12:11.807
Owen Matthews was the intended victim.
I sent you a picture.

12:11.965 --> 12:16.243
Perp's got a tattoo. He's a Lancero,
Colombian paramilitary.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.403
<i>Kind of like our rangers,</i>

12:17.570 --> 12:19.743
only some of them wind up
on the cartel payroll.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.718
Nothing on the guy's cell
identifies his boss.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.151
But I'm sure you'll find out.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.314
The two marshals on board your flight

12:28.481 --> 12:30.984
helped bust an online market
in illegal substances,

12:31.150 --> 12:33.152
called the "Black Market Bazaar."

12:33.319 --> 12:35.993
<i>Think of it as eBay for narcotics
on the Darknet.</i>

12:36.155 --> 12:38.965
Customers could get anything
from a dime bag of marijuana

12:39.125 --> 12:42.402
to a kilogram of heroin delivered
to their door within 24 hours.

12:42.562 --> 12:44.838
Oh, how does everybody
stay out of jail?

12:44.998 --> 12:47.410
<i>The Black Market Bazaar
only accepts Bitcoins,</i>

12:47.567 --> 12:49.569
<i>a digital crypto-currency.</i>

12:49.736 --> 12:52.012
The site was developed
by an unknown mastermind

12:52.171 --> 12:54.447
who calls himself "The Sphinx."

12:54.607 --> 12:56.780
He's still at large and wanted
by every agency

12:56.943 --> 12:58.684
from the DEA to INTERPOL.

12:58.845 --> 13:00.415
Transport must know something.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.151
Owen works for the company
that hosted the site.

13:03.316 --> 13:06.456
It would appear that his job
has placed him in grave danger.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.429
Why were those two marshals
transporting you?

13:12.592 --> 13:13.866
Funny story.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.907
So I'm sitting at my kitchen table
this morning,

13:16.029 --> 13:19.272
having my breakfast, toast, dry.
Butter's bad for your heart.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.207
Almost as bad as a cartel hit man.

13:21.367 --> 13:23.608
Which is no doubt related
to Marshals Crockett and Tubbs

13:23.770 --> 13:26.273
infiltrating my kitchen
to detain me as a critical witness

13:26.439 --> 13:28.009
in this black market case.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.854
Five hours later,
I'm on a flight to Europe

13:30.009 --> 13:31.886
with Mr. Blanket Cover-Up

13:32.045 --> 13:34.218
to testify in some sort
of international court.

13:34.380 --> 13:37.122
So, what do you know
about the Black Market Bazaar?

13:37.283 --> 13:39.320
The company I work for
hosts the site.

13:39.485 --> 13:43.194
But I'm just a programmer.
No bonuses, no benefits.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.894
They don't even pay for my flu shot.
I'm a nobody.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.132
A trained killer
doesn't just go after a nobody.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.617
You better hope he doesn't have
any friends on this flight.

13:54.734 --> 13:56.294
I'm telling you,
they got the wrong guy.

13:56.402 --> 13:58.575
Whatever's going on here,
I'm irrelevant.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.397
You wanted to see me?

14:13.553 --> 14:16.193
Would it be too much to ask you
to snap a twig or...

14:16.356 --> 14:18.029
Not my thing.
We get a new number?

14:18.191 --> 14:22.003
No, but Mr. Reese did.

14:22.161 --> 14:26.439
Owen Matthews.
He's on a plane with him now.

14:26.599 --> 14:29.705
On a plane with a number?
You engineer that, Harold?

14:29.869 --> 14:31.149
I assure you,
I had nothing to do

14:31.173 --> 14:33.914
with his claustrophobic circumstance,
Ms. Shaw,

14:34.073 --> 14:38.920
which presents us
another troubling situation.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.884
What's going on?

14:44.517 --> 14:48.522
You need me to do something
you don't want me to do.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.794
I need you to visit
your former colleagues.

14:54.560 --> 14:55.630
The Activity?

14:57.797 --> 14:59.606
The people that want me dead.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.645
Mind if I ask why?

15:02.802 --> 15:05.976
I fear the number that Mr. Reese
received is relevant.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.586
There's a relevant number
on the plane?

15:11.644 --> 15:13.817
So what's the other side
gonna do about it?

15:13.980 --> 15:17.120
That's exactly what I want to know,
Ms. Shaw.

15:17.283 --> 15:21.925
Perhaps then we can figure out
why The Machine put John there.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.341
Mr. Reese?

15:36.502 --> 15:39.506
Any progress on ID'ing our Colombian
hit man's employer?

15:39.672 --> 15:41.845
<i>I'm afraid not.
I had hoped to hear from Ms. Shaw.</i>

15:42.008 --> 15:44.682
I sent her to visit her former
colleagues with the ISA.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.083
The ISA?
Why?

15:48.181 --> 15:52.027
- It was regarding Owen Matthews.
- Owen Matthews is a relevant number.

15:52.185 --> 15:55.689
- How long have you known?
- I don't know anything for sure.

15:55.855 --> 15:57.815
I just couldn't figure out
why they would consider

15:57.957 --> 16:01.495
a mid-level programmer relevant,
so I sent Ms. Shaw to investigate.

16:01.661 --> 16:05.199
And you didn't tell me anything.
Just like your machine, Finch.

16:05.364 --> 16:09.369
You have all the information,
you just won't share it.

16:15.608 --> 16:17.884
Why are you relevant
to National Security, Owen?

16:18.878 --> 16:21.198
Would you hit your call button?
I really want some almonds.

16:21.314 --> 16:24.386
You're not a nobody.
You're wearing a stun belt.

16:24.550 --> 16:29.124
And a stun belt has a remote.
Hand it over.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.232
Okay, but I'm not kidding
about those almonds though.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.671
At high altitudes, my blood sugar
drops to dangerously low levels...

16:44.337 --> 16:46.749
Why are you relevant
to National Security, Owen?

16:46.906 --> 16:50.149
Funny story, I may have
downplayed my whole role

16:50.309 --> 16:51.629
in the black market thing before.

16:51.793 --> 16:53.673
I might be a little more
than just a programmer.

16:53.697 --> 16:56.056
- Tell me about it.
- I don't like to brag.

16:56.215 --> 16:59.890
No, no, no.
You seem like an angry guy.

17:00.052 --> 17:01.212
Do you wanna talk about that?

17:01.220 --> 17:02.700
I feel like you wanna talk
about that.

17:02.724 --> 17:04.693
Okay, okay, okay.
Fine.

17:04.757 --> 17:08.227
The Black Market Bazaar.
I built it, okay?

17:08.394 --> 17:11.272
I'm a really good designer and the
Sphinx asked for me personally.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.470
He even brought me this coffee
that is so hard to...

17:13.493 --> 17:15.547
- Hold on, hold on.
- You've seen the Sphinx?

17:15.667 --> 17:18.114
Yeah. Smart guy.
Little misunderstood,

17:18.271 --> 17:20.615
- but he has a vision.
- Enlighten me.

17:20.772 --> 17:23.252
He started the site because the
war on drugs was already lost.

17:23.409 --> 17:26.117
Cartels, corner boys, turf wars...

17:26.279 --> 17:27.759
The site just cuts out
the middle man.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.258
- For a price.
- A small transaction fee.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.953
No harm, no foul
and people stop killing each other.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.794
Ever occur to you that the Sphinx
might be the one who wants you dead?

17:36.956 --> 17:40.028
What? No, we're pals.
Why would he wanna kill me?

17:40.192 --> 17:44.436
Because you, my friend, might be
the only one who can identify him.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.273
- Yeah?
- I've identified your hit man's boss.

17:50.436 --> 17:53.280
Raphael Hernandez, cartel kingpin

17:53.439 --> 17:55.783
and one of the Black Market Bazaar's
largest suppliers.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.616
I still can't find Raphael's
connection to Owen.

17:58.778 --> 18:01.258
No need.
Owen built the entire site.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.257
He can identify the Sphinx.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.953
Which means he could also identify
all the Sphinx's accounts.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.462
And if Owen testifies,
he could jeopardize

18:08.621 --> 18:10.157
Raphael's business as well.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.894
None of which explains why
he's relevant to National Security.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.163
Let Shaw worry about that.

18:14.327 --> 18:15.829
Right now,
you and I need to find out

18:15.995 --> 18:18.339
if this Colombian hit man
has a partner in crime.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.953
Hey, where you going?
The ride's getting pretty bumpy.

18:23.002 --> 18:25.042
They're gonna turn the seat belt sign
on any second.

18:25.066 --> 18:27.810
Sorry, Owen. Got to let you
fly solo for a little while.

18:27.974 --> 18:31.353
- But I'm like a sitting duck.
- That's the idea.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.190
Hello, Holly.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.851
Could I get a glass of wine
for our friend in the back?

18:38.017 --> 18:41.021
- He's afraid of flying.
- Yes, of course.

18:44.190 --> 18:46.295
- Is everything okay?
- Fine.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.201
It's just, the marshals.
One of them's out cold,

18:49.362 --> 18:50.962
the other one
hasn't come out of the lav.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.010
And you look like
a nice enough guy, but...

18:53.165 --> 18:56.305
John Wilkinson, Department of
International Homeland Security.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.780
International Home...?
What?

18:59.939 --> 19:02.419
- Do I need to update the captain?
- Oh, no, no, no, you can't.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.350
Right now,
everyone on this plane is a suspect

19:04.510 --> 19:07.150
- and I need your help.
- Help with what?

19:07.313 --> 19:10.453
Keeping everyone calm,
preferably asleep.

19:10.616 --> 19:12.823
Lights out, lots of decaf.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.056
Okay, I can do that.
Anything else?

19:15.221 --> 19:16.700
Keep an eye on the suspect.

19:16.856 --> 19:20.303
If he gets up, just hit this button.
It'll summon me.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.702
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

19:28.868 --> 19:31.041
<i>the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.</i>

19:31.203 --> 19:32.705
<i>Everyone should return to their seats</i>

19:32.872 --> 19:35.011
<i>and remain seated
with their seat belts fastened.</i>

19:58.698 --> 20:01.235
We control the price of X,
not the Sphinx.

20:33.365 --> 20:34.537
Huh?

20:35.768 --> 20:37.475
Guess the honeymoon's over.

20:41.807 --> 20:43.115
Oops.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.836
- We were just closing.
- Of course, you were.

21:00.993 --> 21:04.463
Because who the hell uses
a travel agency anymore?

21:05.998 --> 21:09.502
I must've gotten 100 itineraries
from this place,

21:09.668 --> 21:11.773
but I never actually
thought it existed.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.783
The Activity bothers to keep
a storefront with posters

21:15.941 --> 21:17.614
and dead plants.
Charming.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.915
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about...

21:19.078 --> 21:20.318
Oh, you're right to be afraid.

21:20.479 --> 21:23.153
Because I've done
a little reverse engineering

21:23.315 --> 21:24.953
since Catalyst tried to kill me.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.357
Made a list, checked it twice.
Who's naughty? Who's nice?

21:27.453 --> 21:29.455
And you definitely
haven't played nice.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.861
It's nice to meet you
in person, Foster.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.869
I'd introduce myself
but you already know my name.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.701
Say it.
I'll wait.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.034
- Shaw.
- Good.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.372
And my partner?

21:44.370 --> 21:45.371
Cole.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.540
And you're the facilitating
son of a bitch

21:47.706 --> 21:49.146
who sent us to New York from Berlin.

21:49.170 --> 21:50.681
You booked the reservations

21:50.843 --> 21:53.050
but I'm the only one
who made it back alive.

21:53.212 --> 21:54.732
I don't know
what you're talking about.

21:54.814 --> 21:57.158
What I'm talking about
is you're the one person who knows

21:57.316 --> 21:59.353
where every ISA team is dispatched.

21:59.518 --> 22:03.056
You book their travel.
You sent a team of six after us

22:03.222 --> 22:05.582
and the next trip you booked
had us coming home in a casket.

22:05.606 --> 22:07.232
Except I'm still here.

22:07.393 --> 22:09.737
So, Mr. Facilitator,

22:09.895 --> 22:12.842
when was the last time
you were out from behind the desk?

22:15.534 --> 22:19.004
The way I see it,
you owe me a favor

22:19.171 --> 22:21.412
and I'm calling it in.

22:21.574 --> 22:24.077
Owen Matthews is on a flight
to Rome right now.

22:25.411 --> 22:30.087
Why is this man relevant
to National Security?

22:33.886 --> 22:37.834
You play dumb with me one more time,
I'm gonna make you eat this tie.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.333
Except right before you digest it

22:39.491 --> 22:42.734
I'm gonna pull it back out and
we're gonna do this all over again.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.369
I never know what the target's done,

22:47.533 --> 22:49.740
I just know
that they sent an operative.

22:49.902 --> 22:53.577
- Give me a number.
- Indigo Six Alpha.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.256
Heard a ruckus.
Everything okay?

23:07.353 --> 23:10.129
Newlyweds decided
to join the mile-high club.

23:13.792 --> 23:15.635
First Class problem.
This one's all you.

23:17.029 --> 23:20.636
Let me help you.
Let's get you patched up.

23:20.799 --> 23:24.144
I should notify the pilot.
What if those people wake up?

23:24.303 --> 23:25.304
They won't.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.975
I borrowed some sleeping pills
from the old lady sitting next to me.

23:29.141 --> 23:31.985
Look, I have to take this.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.817
Can you keep an eye on Owen for me?

23:38.784 --> 23:40.821
Colombians aren't the only ones
who want Owen dead.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.990
<i>A couple of ex-Mossad agents
aren't too fond of him either.</i>

23:44.156 --> 23:45.931
I don't suppose they told you why.

23:46.091 --> 23:49.163
Something about the price of ecstasy
and then they stuck a fork in me.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.104
- A fork?
- Any idea why they went after Owen?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.972
<i>Israeli criminals control
Europe's MDMA trade.</i>

23:55.134 --> 23:57.134
I can't imagine
that they would welcome competition

23:57.158 --> 23:58.604
from an online drug market.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.184
Starting to wonder who on this plane
doesn't want Owen dead.

24:02.341 --> 24:05.652
I'm afraid Ms. Shaw
has more bad news.

24:07.846 --> 24:12.022
ISA has an operative on the flight,
Indigo Six Alpha.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.925
You ask your contact what that means?

24:14.086 --> 24:16.692
Didn't have to.
I was Indigo Five Alpha.

24:16.855 --> 24:20.325
That guy has my old job
and he's thereto kill Owen.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.768
You get the operative's description?

24:22.928 --> 24:27.206
Tall, dark, badass in a suit.
Sound familiar?

24:33.372 --> 24:34.817
Got to go.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.454
Oh, God.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.392
Excuse me.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.694
Have a seat.

24:53.859 --> 24:55.998
Whoa.

24:57.563 --> 25:00.407
I need the zip ties
you keep for unruly passengers,

25:00.566 --> 25:01.738
a blanket for this guy

25:01.900 --> 25:04.346
- and a shot of whiskey.
- For who?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.744
Put it in his sippy cup.
One finger.

25:08.907 --> 25:12.013
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Why don't we go find your mommy?

25:14.546 --> 25:15.650
Owen?

25:29.928 --> 25:33.933
The captain says we can't divert.
There's nowhere to land.

25:34.099 --> 25:35.942
Breathe, Holly.
- I can't.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.409
Then drink.

25:43.442 --> 25:44.482
I could've been a teacher.

25:44.610 --> 25:48.456
But, no, I wanted to see the world,
meet interesting people.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.924
There's plenty of interesting people
on this plane.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.283
All trying to kill each other.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.627
Which I get because you know
what this job has taught me?

25:55.788 --> 25:58.462
- That people are horrible.
- I know what you mean.

25:58.624 --> 26:00.900
Even the pilots call me
"Sweetheart, Doll Face."

26:01.060 --> 26:02.733
And the other flight attendants?

26:02.895 --> 26:06.604
Carlos is a selfish idiot who doesn't
know what the hell he's doing.

26:06.765 --> 26:09.302
Whatever happened to people
helping other people?

26:12.604 --> 26:15.141
Holly, I hate to tell you this.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.111
You're good at your job.

26:18.277 --> 26:22.748
That's so nice of you.
Thank you for that.

26:22.915 --> 26:27.830
- And for saving me from that maniac.
- He was just trying to kill Owen.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.626
Where is Owen?
How did he disappear?

26:30.789 --> 26:32.996
He didn't.

26:37.729 --> 26:40.835
Hey, guys. I wasn't trying
to escape or anything.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.275
I was actually trying to sleep
in my seat.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.678
But I got this terrible...
Oh, a pinched nerve in my lower back.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.159
It must be sciatica or something.

26:48.183 --> 26:50.518
It was like someone
was stabbing me in the back.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.678
You can probably relate to...

26:53.846 --> 26:56.019
Sorry, sometimes it's just faster.

26:56.181 --> 27:00.823
- Why does everyone want him dead?
- He's relevant to National Security.

27:00.986 --> 27:03.023
Right, just like you work

27:03.188 --> 27:06.260
for the International Department
of Homeland Security.

27:06.425 --> 27:10.168
- What do you really do?
- Nothing. I quit my job.

27:10.329 --> 27:14.368
- Didn't like your boss?
- I didn't like my boss's boss.

27:15.868 --> 27:20.374
Just take us to the cargo hold
and we won't cause any more problems.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.359
<i>Good evening, Ms. Shaw.</i>

27:35.521 --> 27:38.525
Have you been able to determine
why the ISA wants Owen Matthews dead?

27:43.795 --> 27:48.676
Working on it. Meeting up
with an old friend for coffee.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.917
Oh, damn it.

27:57.576 --> 27:59.816
Hey, going through other people's stuff?
That's not cool.

27:59.912 --> 28:05.191
- What are you looking for?
- A safety razor, maybe. Hair spray.

28:05.350 --> 28:07.023
Dude, your hair looks fine.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.564
That salt and pepper thing's
like catnip to soccer moms.

28:09.721 --> 28:11.200
<i>Go au naturel.</i>

28:12.891 --> 28:14.700
<i>Took care of the ISA operative.</i>

28:14.860 --> 28:16.862
Still not sure
if The Machine sent me

28:17.029 --> 28:19.441
or if this guy's worth saving.

28:19.598 --> 28:22.204
You're scheduled to land
in two hours.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.369
<i>Ms. Shaw is still in the process
of finding out</i>

28:24.536 --> 28:26.709
why ISA wants Owen dead.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.716
ISA, Colombians, Israelis,

28:29.875 --> 28:33.015
all want the head
of a lowly website designer...

28:34.446 --> 28:38.223
...instead of a...
mastermind.

28:40.385 --> 28:43.229
See, I hate it when you look at me
like that. it's not polite.

28:43.388 --> 28:45.800
You didn't just build the site.

28:46.892 --> 28:50.271
You know how it works,
where the money's at.

28:50.429 --> 28:52.636
Okay, look,
I'm not a moron, all right?

28:52.798 --> 28:55.802
I socked away a few funds,
diverted some accounts.

28:58.637 --> 29:01.743
Something else
you wanna tell me, Owen?

29:02.207 --> 29:04.915
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.
Don't tase me, bro.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.647
I didn't just build the site.

29:07.813 --> 29:09.224
I'm the guy-

29:10.148 --> 29:11.786
You're the Sphinx.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.294
I created a business model
from my bedroom

29:14.453 --> 29:16.262
<i>that revolutionized
an international market</i>

29:16.421 --> 29:20.494
and cut violence in the drug trade
by half. You're welcome.

29:20.659 --> 29:22.935
Yeah, people are just lining up
to thank you.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.598
It's okay.
I have a plan.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.643
Okay, I have 100 million bucks
in Bitcoins.

29:28.800 --> 29:32.145
You get me off this plane
and past INTERPOL in one piece,

29:32.304 --> 29:34.978
I'll split it with you.
Good deal, right?

29:35.140 --> 29:37.313
You think you're a mastermind.

29:37.476 --> 29:39.478
Hey, that's the media's word,
not mine.

29:39.645 --> 29:44.355
You computer guys, you build
something you can't control,

29:44.516 --> 29:48.020
<i>and when it backfires,
you won't accept responsibility.</i>

29:48.186 --> 29:49.494
What are we talking about here?

29:49.655 --> 29:51.692
Have you really made anything better?

29:51.857 --> 29:54.133
Does it look like,
you've stopped the violence?

29:55.761 --> 29:57.206
Okay, are we still talking about me?

29:57.496 --> 29:59.772
Because it seems like,
you're mad at somebody else.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.375
I thought you got rid
of that walking steroid.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.041
Guess not.

30:14.846 --> 30:18.055
Dizzy?
Tongue a little itchy?

30:19.051 --> 30:20.052
Shaw.

30:20.218 --> 30:23.131
You once taught me that an operative
should always wet their lips

30:23.288 --> 30:25.791
and wait for symptoms
before drinking anything.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.164
Scopolamine.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.831
Tachycardia will be setting in shortly.
Fatigue, amnesia...

30:31.997 --> 30:33.999
I know what the drug does.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.545
You're conscious but you've been
rendered completely docile.

30:37.703 --> 30:40.741
- I'm on a job right now.
- You were.

30:40.906 --> 30:44.911
Guy with the glasses
and the laptop, right?

30:47.512 --> 30:49.632
That was the number
you were supposed to kill tonight?

30:50.582 --> 30:53.586
I trained you well.
Too well.

30:53.752 --> 30:58.258
I always liked you, Hersh.
Even after you killed me.

31:00.525 --> 31:05.941
You put an ISA operative
on a flight to kill this guy.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.600
Why?

31:09.768 --> 31:12.942
He built the biggest narcotics
marketplace on the Darknet.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.278
Billion dollars in sales.

31:15.440 --> 31:18.546
You can't stop the drug trade
but you can tax it.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.712
Tax it?
Since when?

31:20.879 --> 31:23.587
We were on to the Sphinx a year ago.

31:23.749 --> 31:25.558
But when it comes
to funding our operation,

31:25.717 --> 31:30.132
the black budget only goes so far.
So we took 30 percent off the top.

31:30.288 --> 31:31.961
So why take him out now?

31:32.124 --> 31:34.798
Nobody asks
how we keep the country safe.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.372
But they'll start
if that kid goes public.

31:38.430 --> 31:39.773
National Security risk.

31:39.931 --> 31:43.276
And that flight
is a perfect window of opportunity.

31:43.435 --> 31:48.145
Well, I think you might have
some competition on the plane.

31:48.306 --> 31:52.083
Shaw, your new employers...

31:52.310 --> 31:55.314
- Mm-hm?
- ...are they treating you okay?

31:57.449 --> 31:59.292
They haven't tried to kill me yet.

31:59.451 --> 32:02.330
I could've killed you tonight, Hersh,
and I didn't.

32:02.487 --> 32:05.161
Too bad you won't remember
any of this.

32:19.171 --> 32:20.172
Whoa!

32:34.920 --> 32:36.092
Not the face!

33:01.146 --> 33:02.716
Fore.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.325
Nice shot.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.521
Mr. Reese,
it seems that the ISA

33:09.688 --> 33:11.565
took a mutually beneficial
financial interest

33:11.723 --> 33:12.861
in the Black Market Bazaar

33:13.024 --> 33:15.026
<i>which they could ill afford
to have come out.</i>

33:15.193 --> 33:17.696
Still doesn't explain why
The Machine put me on this plane.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.171
I didn't program The Machine

33:19.331 --> 33:22.073
to detect national embarrassments,
Mr. Reese.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.373
I designed it to prevent
a national tragedy.

33:24.536 --> 33:25.976
You're saying they missed something?

33:26.000 --> 33:28.411
They aren't the only ones
who want Owen dead.

33:28.573 --> 33:32.020
Raphael Hernandez once blew up an
entire floor of a hotel in Medellin

33:32.177 --> 33:33.884
to prevent a witness from testifying.

33:34.045 --> 33:36.685
Well, I already took out
Raphael's hit man.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.589
I've accessed his e-mail.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.492
Raphael has ordered his team
to take out Owen

33:41.653 --> 33:43.724
by any means necessary,

33:43.889 --> 33:45.527
even if it means
taking down the plane.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.068
Well, how many hit squad members
were on that e-mail?

33:48.226 --> 33:49.933
Two.
Colombian paramilitary.

33:50.095 --> 33:52.234
There's another Lancero on board.

33:52.397 --> 33:54.117
But I checked the manifest,
every passenger.

33:54.141 --> 33:56.052
He's not a passenger, Finch.

34:10.047 --> 34:11.721
Good evening, Captain.

35:04.736 --> 35:06.340
He's lost a lot of blood.

35:06.504 --> 35:09.144
If we don't get him to the hospital
in the next hour, he's a goner.

35:09.174 --> 35:11.848
I heard something,
saw Carlos enter the cockpit.

35:12.010 --> 35:14.115
It's locked.
No response from the intercom.

35:14.279 --> 35:18.489
The plane's banking.
We're losing altitude.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.958
And I can't contact the tower.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.359
Knew there was something off
about that guy.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.120
It's because
he's not a flight attendant.

35:24.155 --> 35:26.829
He's a professional assassin,
paratrooper.

35:26.992 --> 35:30.269
- He's taking us down.
- I need you to get me in there now.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.104
He's overridden the code.

35:36.267 --> 35:38.372
The situation's critical, Finch.
Can you help us?

35:38.536 --> 35:40.209
I'm trying to get
into the flight management system

35:40.372 --> 35:41.772
through the plane's satellite link.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.877
- Where is Owen?
- Stashed in the cargo hold.

35:53.685 --> 35:55.392
I'm gonna need to borrow this.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.157
Mr. Reese, I've gotten into the FMS.

35:57.322 --> 35:59.996
It appears that he's disabled
the autopilot.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.798
I can't seem to override
the manual operator.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.565
You ever flown a plane
this size before?

36:04.729 --> 36:07.573
Heavens no, props only.
This is a commercial jumbo jet.

36:07.732 --> 36:09.712
Somebody's gonna have
to stick the landing.

36:09.868 --> 36:11.347
<i>Putting you on speaker.</i>

36:16.708 --> 36:19.245
Excuse me.
Can I have some water, please?

36:31.389 --> 36:32.925
<i>Mr. Reese?</i>

36:33.091 --> 36:35.935
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're experiencing a bit of turbulence.

36:36.094 --> 36:38.597
<i>The captain asks that
everyone remain seated at this time.</i>

36:38.763 --> 36:41.937
<i>Make sure your tray tables are up
and all seat belts are fastened.</i>

36:49.741 --> 36:51.948
Oh, my God!
What's happening?

36:59.551 --> 37:03.863
- Mr. Reese, who's flying the plane?
- Need a little help, Finch.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.536
Oh, dear.

37:19.804 --> 37:24.310
- Finch, we're going down.
- Hold on tight, Mr. Reese.

37:26.945 --> 37:28.345
Stick and rudder, stick and rudder.

37:31.649 --> 37:34.425
Small corrections.
Wings level.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.325
Airspeed and altitude.

37:48.066 --> 37:50.012
<i>Take us home, Finch.</i>

37:51.136 --> 37:54.015
Keep it level.
Keep it level.

37:59.344 --> 38:01.483
<i>I'm coming in too hot.
I'm gonna be long.</i>

38:06.785 --> 38:08.287
<i>There might be a bounce.</i>

38:21.099 --> 38:22.874
You hear that, Finch?

38:23.034 --> 38:26.208
<i>That's for you.
Yeah, you just stuck this bird.</i>

38:26.371 --> 38:28.783
Thank you, Mr. Reese.
How about Owen?

38:28.940 --> 38:31.716
The only relevant number
on this plane is 130 people.

38:35.814 --> 38:38.886
<i>Grazie. Arrivederci</i>

38:41.219 --> 38:46.168
- So what is it you really do again?
- I help people.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.668
You wanna help me get a drink?

39:10.915 --> 39:13.595
Man, do you think you could've
stuffed me into a case that breathed?

39:13.619 --> 39:15.895
Next time, just throw a garbage bag
over my head

39:16.054 --> 39:19.228
- and stick me in a casket.
- Here.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.097
Go to this address.

39:21.259 --> 39:23.261
Stay there until you hear
from a man named Harold.

39:23.428 --> 39:25.203
Harold?
The guy on the phone?

39:25.363 --> 39:28.105
You're out of business.
Stay off the grid.

39:28.266 --> 39:31.008
Do not reach out
to anyone you once knew.

39:31.169 --> 39:32.910
Well, what if I wanna
send you something,

39:33.071 --> 39:35.108
repay you for all you've done?

39:35.273 --> 39:37.378
I'm not in it for the money, Owen.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.786
You almost say that like it's your job,
which would be insane.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.174
Well, whatever you're in it for,
good on you, man.

39:45.198 --> 39:46.478
I appreciate you saving my neck.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.635
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Thanks for the drink.

40:01.799 --> 40:05.440
Well, I hope you get a better crew
to work with on your return flight.

40:06.738 --> 40:10.550
Give me a call
if you're ever back in the city.

40:12.243 --> 40:13.745
<i>- Ciao.
- Ciao.</i>

40:38.336 --> 40:42.842
- She seems nice.
- You track me down, Harold?

40:43.007 --> 40:47.183
Just flew in to get Owen situated
with a new identity and destination.

40:49.480 --> 40:51.687
- Is that it?
- <i>Prego.</i>

40:51.849 --> 40:53.123
<i>Grazie.</i>

40:57.522 --> 40:59.195
Mr. Reese, I understand
your frustration

40:59.357 --> 41:02.099
with the opacity of The Machine.

41:03.027 --> 41:06.372
But there's a reason
I chose to make it that way.

41:07.131 --> 41:10.544
The Machine only gives us numbers

41:10.702 --> 41:14.047
because I would always rather

41:14.205 --> 41:17.709
that a human element remain

41:17.875 --> 41:22.017
in determining something
so critical as someone's fate.

41:23.848 --> 41:25.350
We have free will.

41:25.516 --> 41:29.054
And with that comes
great responsibility...

41:30.021 --> 41:32.365
...and sometimes great loss.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.562
I miss her dearly, too.

41:46.738 --> 41:49.651
- When are you leaving?
- Soon.

41:50.408 --> 41:52.319
I thought I would go see this exhibit

41:52.477 --> 41:55.822
at the Giorgio de Chirico
house museum.

41:57.482 --> 42:00.019
An artist that Grace
was very fond of.

42:03.888 --> 42:05.868
You're welcome to join me.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.731
I'm not sure I can, Finch.

42:14.766 --> 42:18.543
While I'm in Italy, I thought
I'd get fitted for a new suit.

42:24.242 --> 42:27.451
Oh, of course. We should call
my atelier in the via Palestro.

42:27.612 --> 42:30.456
See if Gianni could fit you in after lunch.
He's the best.

42:30.615 --> 42:34.927
I thought maybe,
I could hitch a ride back with you.

42:35.086 --> 42:40.126
I'm not quite ready
to fly commercial yet, so...

42:43.728 --> 42:45.730
But I need to get back to work.

42:46.931 --> 42:48.604
Certainly, Mr. Reese.

42:50.134 --> 42:51.807
I know the pilot.

42:52.537 --> 42:54.813
I think we could delay that flight.
