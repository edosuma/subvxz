Dan: Eyes on each other.
Let's go.

00:38.100 --> 00:39.330
Run it, run it, run it.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.010
Whoo!
Wait. Wait.

00:41.010 --> 00:42.810
All right.

00:42.810 --> 00:43.810
All right.

Let's pick up the pace.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.310
Out of the way.
Out of the way. Come on.

00:46.310 --> 00:48.740
Let's go.
Come on, boys.

00:50.480 --> 00:52.840
Hanson: Dan, we need to
have a conversation,

00:52.850 --> 00:54.510
and, honestly,
it's not a pleasant one.

00:54.520 --> 00:55.650
Dan: Okay.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.190
At the school,
we have a code of conduct.

00:57.190 --> 00:59.830
It's a code we expect
all students to adhere to.

00:59.830 --> 01:03.200
There's an issue we've had to
address involving Rebecca.

01:03.200 --> 01:05.170
Text messages of hers
have been posted online.

01:05.170 --> 01:06.530
Texts of what?

01:06.530 --> 01:07.660
I think you know.

01:07.670 --> 01:09.270
No, I-I don't know.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.840
Messages in which
she's arranging

01:10.840 --> 01:12.510
to sell drugs to other students.

01:12.510 --> 01:14.770
- Who's saying this?
- Including Taylor Blaine.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.300
I want to see what... whatever
supposedly... We're suspending...

01:16.310 --> 01:17.840
We're suspending Rebecca
from school.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.710
Well, you can't... Based
on the nature of the texts,

01:19.710 --> 01:21.010
we're suspending her
indefinitely.

01:21.010 --> 01:22.270
- Well, you can't do that.
- Dan...

01:22.280 --> 01:23.940
Who... Who... Who's putting
these things online?

01:23.950 --> 01:26.460
A flood of personal information about
Leyland families has been made public.

01:26.460 --> 01:27.780
We don't know who's doing it.

01:27.790 --> 01:30.890
Whoever it is, people,
they make things up, you know,

01:30.890 --> 01:32.860
and they put these things online
all the time.

01:32.860 --> 01:36.430
Rebecca's being suspended.
We've contacted the police.

01:58.150 --> 02:01.680
Anne: It's the truth.
It's about the truth.

02:01.690 --> 02:04.430
You don't have to do this.
You do not have to... Sir.

02:06.090 --> 02:09.350
Anne: These people
can't lie anymore.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.860
They can't hide
from what they've done.

02:10.860 --> 02:11.860
Michael...

02:11.870 --> 02:14.270
No one is gonna get off
this time.

02:14.270 --> 02:16.400
Michael!

02:16.400 --> 02:18.360
People know the boy you shot,

02:18.370 --> 02:20.030
the kids
on the basketball team...

02:20.040 --> 02:21.610
They assaulted you.

02:21.610 --> 02:23.250
The coach's daughter
sold you drugs.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.570
How do they know?

02:24.580 --> 02:26.710
E-mails, texts.

02:26.710 --> 02:28.070
There's a lot of
personal information

02:28.080 --> 02:29.880
about Leyland families
up online.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.410
How did it get out there?

02:31.420 --> 02:34.020
Uh, it's just... it's just...
It's just all out there.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.890
Everyone knows the kind of
people they really are,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.030
what we've been dealing with.

02:38.020 --> 02:39.250
I don't understand
what's happening.

02:39.260 --> 02:42.400
It's a good thing.
There's enough in your favor.

02:42.400 --> 02:44.600
We take this to a judge,
it's gonna help at the trial.

02:44.600 --> 02:46.940
You may not even
have to serve time.

02:46.940 --> 02:50.760
Maybe... Maybe they put you
in a psychiatric hospital.

02:52.870 --> 02:55.530
Just hang in there
a little longer.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.420
Rollins: When Taylor
bought the drugs from you,

03:01.420 --> 03:04.040
did he tell you anything
about his plans?

03:04.050 --> 03:06.050
No.

03:06.050 --> 03:08.650
What kinds of drugs
did you sell to Taylor Blaine?

03:08.660 --> 03:12.230
Uh, some weed
and some OxyContin.

03:13.430 --> 03:15.400
Where did you
get the drugs from?

03:15.400 --> 03:19.230
I got the Oxy from a friend
and the weed...

03:19.230 --> 03:21.130
Dan:
We should have a lawyer.

03:21.130 --> 03:22.460
We're entitled to a lawyer.

03:22.470 --> 03:24.170
Just tell her.
No, we...

03:24.170 --> 03:26.140
We... we don't have
to say anything.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.810
She...
She got it from me.

03:27.810 --> 03:31.240
I keep marijuana in the house.

03:31.240 --> 03:33.940
She has it in candy form.
She gets migraines.

03:33.950 --> 03:36.790
Rollins: Marijuana isn't legal
for medicinal use in Indiana.

03:36.790 --> 03:40.310
Right. I'm the reason that
the drugs were in the house.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.190
You should be charging me
and not...

03:42.190 --> 03:44.160
Possessing drugs
is a misdemeanor.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.860
Selling drugs is a felony.

03:45.860 --> 03:47.530
- What do you mean?
- She had them from me.

03:47.530 --> 03:48.800
- What... What are you gonna do?
- If I... If I...

03:48.800 --> 03:52.870
C-Can you just tell us
what happens now?

03:52.870 --> 03:54.840
Rollins: We'll probably
release your daughter

03:54.840 --> 03:56.160
on her own recognizance.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.670
But for a Level 6 felony,

03:57.670 --> 04:00.780
she could be looking at time in
a juvenile-detention facility,

04:00.780 --> 04:03.970
anywhere from 6 months
to 2 1/2 years.

04:03.980 --> 04:05.780
S-She's never
gotten in trouble before.

04:05.780 --> 04:07.480
She's never even
had a speeding ticket.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.020
Her past history will be
taken into consideration,

04:10.020 --> 04:11.520
but so will the fact that

04:11.520 --> 04:14.460
she was tangentially related
to a homicide.

04:14.460 --> 04:16.450
I need to have your daughter
fingerprinted,

04:16.459 --> 04:19.190
and then you can take her home.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.740
Okay, t-t-there...
There are so many people

04:32.740 --> 04:34.580
that can speak to what kind of
person she really is, you know?

04:34.570 --> 04:36.670
And, like, we'll get a lawyer.
That's the first thing.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.850
But like she said,
the judge will...

04:37.850 --> 04:39.740
You know, the more people
we have speaking

04:39.750 --> 04:43.350
to how good Becca is... you
know, this crap that's online...

04:43.350 --> 04:44.520
That won't matter.
They can't prove it.

04:44.520 --> 04:46.890
I told Anne Blaine.

04:48.890 --> 04:51.690
I talked to her about Becca.

04:51.690 --> 04:55.190
I-I was so worried that...
That her son would talk,

04:55.190 --> 04:58.420
and I... I th... I thought
that I could reach out to her

04:58.430 --> 04:59.690
as a mother.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.700
But why... why... why would you
say anything?!

05:02.700 --> 05:04.900
I-I had to do something.

05:04.900 --> 05:07.000
Somebody...
Somebody had to do something.

Ken:
I need you all to listen,

05:51.380 --> 05:53.410
because things are gonna happen
very quickly.

05:53.420 --> 05:54.550

05:54.550 --> 05:56.380

- Okay.

Kevin gave me a statement.
- He did that.

06:00.230 --> 06:01.760
I'm the one who withheld a
statement. I did that on my own.

06:01.760 --> 06:03.150
- No.
- What are you talking about?

06:03.160 --> 06:04.990
And they're going to try to
connect our e-mails

06:05.000 --> 06:06.740
about going after Anne Blaine

06:06.740 --> 06:08.730
and her medical records
getting put online.

06:08.740 --> 06:10.640
Don't say anything about that.

Nothing's gonna happen.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.730

Take care of your son.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.020
Michael, what did you do?

06:26.020 --> 06:27.820
I couldn't let Kevin
take the hit. I'm sorry.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.690
Tell me what you did.

06:31.490 --> 06:33.210
I told him to get rid
of Kevin's confession.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.690
Did you know about this?

06:36.700 --> 06:37.960
No.

06:37.960 --> 06:40.990
We brought Kevin in here
to tell the truth!

06:41.000 --> 06:42.440
What's the truth get us?

06:42.440 --> 06:44.670
It makes Kevin and his friends
look like thugs,

06:44.670 --> 06:46.460
Taylor Blaine
look like a victim.

06:46.470 --> 06:49.130
The boy is a murderer, and I wasn't gonna
help him walk and make Kevin look guilty.

06:49.140 --> 06:50.440
Kevin didn't know
about the beating!

06:50.440 --> 06:52.040
Who's gonna believe that?

06:52.050 --> 06:54.510
Everything that boy's mother
has said about us.

06:54.510 --> 06:56.170
You gonna trust other people to
know, like, lies from the truth?

06:56.180 --> 06:58.010
Well, now Kevin
looks like the liar,

06:58.020 --> 06:59.890
and our friend
is gonna admit to something

06:59.890 --> 07:01.490
just to keep us out of trouble.

07:01.490 --> 07:03.120
So now you want to get religion.
It's not time for religion.

07:03.120 --> 07:05.320
No, it's not about religion.
You're digging Kevin in deeper!

07:05.320 --> 07:06.850
It should have never even
been about him!

07:06.860 --> 07:11.560
Two boys at a party having sex,
and he gets caught up?

07:11.560 --> 07:13.360
Whatever we've done for our son,

07:13.370 --> 07:15.640
it's nothing compared to
what that woman has done.

07:18.540 --> 07:19.970
Did you have anything to do

07:19.970 --> 07:22.010
with that woman's medical
records coming out online?

07:25.240 --> 07:26.570
You know what?

07:26.580 --> 07:28.380
I wish I did.

07:32.390 --> 07:34.560
When you talk to the detectives,

07:34.560 --> 07:37.080
you're gonna tell them
everything you know...

07:37.090 --> 07:38.660
Everything!

07:38.660 --> 07:40.990
You understand?

07:40.990 --> 07:43.720
Yeah.

07:58.180 --> 08:01.380
So...

08:01.380 --> 08:03.180
I resign, and I get...

08:03.180 --> 08:05.710
$75,000.

08:07.420 --> 08:10.190
That's a hell of a settlement.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.290
That's hush-up money.

08:12.290 --> 08:15.720
That's "be quiet and go away"
money.

08:15.730 --> 08:19.800
You've become a problem,
and the board wants you to stop.

08:20.970 --> 08:22.240
Look, I was never a problem

08:22.240 --> 08:24.570
until I started
being your soldier.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.970
You weren't a problem before

08:26.970 --> 08:30.300
because, honest to God, Chris,
you never took a stand before.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.380
The district gave me hell
for things that happened

08:32.380 --> 08:34.409
at some other school...
A private school...

08:34.409 --> 08:35.809
You had a chance
to defend yourself.

08:35.820 --> 08:37.320
You wasted it.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.090
I sat through your review.

08:39.090 --> 08:41.659
I saw you get crushed
by the whites on one side

08:41.659 --> 08:43.110
and the Hispanics on the other.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.280
A kid got beat.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.820
A girl got harassed.

08:46.830 --> 08:48.330
It's not all about race.

08:48.330 --> 08:50.160
A black student got beat.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.790
The Hispanics rallied around
their own.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.470
And the minute
a black administrator

08:54.470 --> 08:55.900
tries to say something about it,

08:55.900 --> 08:58.060
they find a way
to move you out the door.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.670
What do you think
it's all about?

08:59.670 --> 09:00.770
I'm not getting pushed out

09:00.770 --> 09:02.470
because
I was trying to do right.

09:02.480 --> 09:05.310
Do you understand
what's going on here?

09:05.310 --> 09:08.670
You litigate to keep your job.
That costs the district money.

09:08.680 --> 09:10.610
You sign that paper
and take a settlement,

09:10.620 --> 09:12.190
it costs the district, too.

09:12.190 --> 09:14.790
All those things
you wanted to do for the school,

09:14.790 --> 09:19.760
either way, right now you're
just costing the district money.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.360
What do I do?

09:25.360 --> 09:28.060
I really don't know
that it matters anymore.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.540
And everything that's going on
now, it's not right.

09:32.540 --> 09:33.940
You know, the only thing
I was trying to do

09:33.940 --> 09:35.210
was hold The Leyland School
accountable

09:35.210 --> 09:37.140
for the damage they did
to Taylor Blaine.

09:37.140 --> 09:39.370
You know, the people who are putting all
this personal information online now...

09:39.380 --> 09:40.680
They're just going after
anybody.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.850
That's not how it works.
- Since when are there rules?

09:42.850 --> 09:44.550
You went after people.
You put up e-mails.

09:44.550 --> 09:45.690
My...
My thing got hijacked.

09:45.690 --> 09:47.190
I'm not trying to shame people
for no reason.

09:47.190 --> 09:48.890
You... You... You need to
do something about this.

09:48.890 --> 09:51.330
You don't like what's happening,
you need to stop it.

09:51.330 --> 09:52.650
I-I mean,
it's not that easy.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.030
I don't even know
who these people are.

09:54.030 --> 09:55.360
That's a problem, isn't it,

09:55.360 --> 09:56.520
when people
who aren't accountable

09:56.530 --> 09:58.430
start taking control?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.530
It was after a basketball game.

10:05.540 --> 10:08.410
We lost bad,

10:08.410 --> 10:11.180
and everything was just
feeling wrong, you know?

10:11.180 --> 10:13.380
And, uh, we went to eat after,
me and some of the guys,

10:13.380 --> 10:15.480
and I just started jawing on
them, you know...

10:15.480 --> 10:17.410
Taylor Blaine,
how I don't like him,

10:17.420 --> 10:19.520
how I think he lied
about getting raped, and...

10:19.520 --> 10:20.860
Rollins:
You know he was lying?

10:20.860 --> 10:22.550
You know
he was telling the truth?

10:27.060 --> 10:30.500
Anyways, I was going on about
him, talking the talk, right,

10:30.500 --> 10:32.330
and they took it for real.

10:32.330 --> 10:35.160
Some of the guys showed up
at my place,

10:35.170 --> 10:36.600
told me to call Taylor,

10:36.600 --> 10:38.330
tell him to meet me
at the 5th Street Rec Center.

10:38.340 --> 10:40.870
And what they say, you do?

10:40.870 --> 10:43.270
They were looking to
mess somebody up.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.570
It was Taylor or it was me.

10:45.580 --> 10:47.780
As far as they cared,
any fag will do.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.350
What led you to believe that?

10:49.350 --> 10:51.780
I don't believe it.

10:51.780 --> 10:53.010
Wes said it.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.220
Wes Baxter... the same boy
Taylor Blaine shot?

10:55.220 --> 10:56.210
Yeah.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.280
Who else?

10:57.290 --> 10:58.360
LeSean Young.

10:58.360 --> 11:00.530
You and Wes
were the ringleaders.

11:00.530 --> 11:02.930
You pressured Eric
into calling Taylor,

11:02.930 --> 11:05.070
and then you led a little gang
to go beat him.

11:05.070 --> 11:06.290
Really?

11:06.300 --> 11:07.740
I ain't saying nothing to you.

11:07.740 --> 11:09.060
You targeted Taylor Blaine

11:09.070 --> 11:11.210
because of
his sexual orientation.

11:11.210 --> 11:12.900
You know what that is?

11:12.910 --> 11:14.680
That's a hate crime.

11:15.910 --> 11:18.640
You know what?
Man, go... yourself.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.940
Is there anything else
you want to add?

11:24.650 --> 11:26.650
No.

11:26.650 --> 11:30.320
What's going to happen?

11:30.320 --> 11:33.050
Are... Are you going to
arrest him?

11:33.060 --> 11:35.060
We're still investigating,

11:35.060 --> 11:37.790
but if your son
wants to help himself,

11:37.800 --> 11:43.170
he needs to be ready
to repeat all of this in court.

12:00.620 --> 12:03.160
They're gonna put me in jail.

12:03.160 --> 12:05.790
You heard what she said.

12:05.790 --> 12:06.920
If you testify...

12:06.930 --> 12:09.360
I got to go in court

12:09.360 --> 12:11.590
and say that I'm a thug

12:11.600 --> 12:14.170
and that I got the guy who says
I raped him beat up?

12:14.170 --> 12:15.970
Curt:
No. You got to help yourself.

12:15.970 --> 12:18.300
That is helping him.

12:18.300 --> 12:20.530
That's doing for him.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.180
No, you're doing this for you.

12:22.180 --> 12:23.470
He lied about me.

12:23.480 --> 12:25.510
He... He killed Wes.

12:25.510 --> 12:27.610
But he gets to be the victim.

12:27.610 --> 12:28.970
I told the truth.

12:28.980 --> 12:30.780
From the jump, I told the truth.

12:30.780 --> 12:33.380
But the rest of my life, they're
gonna think I attacked him.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.820
Curt:
Look, you're 17, all right?

12:35.820 --> 12:38.120
This isn't
the rest of your life.

12:38.120 --> 12:40.180
Things can change.

12:43.360 --> 12:44.990
Somebody screams rape,

12:45.000 --> 12:48.870
and nobody cares
what really happened.

12:53.410 --> 12:55.780
How does he get to own
that night?

12:59.010 --> 13:00.770
How does he get to own me?

13:26.010 --> 13:28.270
Evans:
Barnsdall Tech Services.

13:28.270 --> 13:31.870
Sebastian: Um, y-yeah, yeah.
I-I-I'm looking for Evans.

13:31.880 --> 13:34.380
This is Evans.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.710
Hello?

13:35.710 --> 13:37.580
I-I-I know who you are.

13:37.580 --> 13:38.880
I'm sorry. I don't...

13:38.880 --> 13:41.750
Listen, I know who you are,
and...

13:41.750 --> 13:44.450
And I know all the crap
you're posting online.

13:44.460 --> 13:45.690
This Leyland thing
is my project,

13:45.690 --> 13:47.850
and going after everybody,
you're making it dirty.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.430
I'm handling it my way.
You need to back off.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.070
You hear me?

13:53.070 --> 13:55.300
Nobody controls
the digital space.

13:56.940 --> 13:59.710
Leave it alone.
You understand?

13:59.710 --> 14:02.780
I can make things...

14:24.460 --> 14:28.790
Chris: I wanted to apologize for
how I handled your situation.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.500
I was more focused on
what happened

14:30.500 --> 14:33.870
between the two boys
than what happened to you.

14:37.580 --> 14:42.780
You know, people are saying
maybe I didn't do this or that

14:42.780 --> 14:48.910
because I favor black students
over Hispanic students.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.320
If you'd come to me, I would
have done everything I could.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.090
I didn't want to talk about it.

14:54.090 --> 14:55.650
You have a right to speak up.

14:55.660 --> 14:56.990
You know what?

14:57.000 --> 15:01.130
This whole thing,
nobody's cared about me.

15:01.130 --> 15:04.330
Tre didn't care about me
when he was grabbing at me.

15:04.340 --> 15:07.670
All I was to Mateo
was something to fight over.

15:07.670 --> 15:09.770
And to all those kids
outside protesting,

15:09.780 --> 15:12.180
I was just
something to get mad about.

15:12.180 --> 15:14.950
And Taylor...

15:14.950 --> 15:16.280
All I was to him

15:16.280 --> 15:18.740
was a way of fooling people
into thinking he's straight.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.780
I thought Taylor was a liar

15:24.790 --> 15:28.130
'cause he didn't tell anybody
about Eric raping him.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.700
All I got was grabbed.

15:32.700 --> 15:35.100
I don't want to say anything
to anybody.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.910
You know what's messed up?

15:42.910 --> 15:47.850
The only people in all this who
did right by me and my family,

15:47.850 --> 15:50.850
The Leyland School.

15:50.850 --> 15:54.060
Leyland? How?

15:56.860 --> 16:00.060
You got to think about yourself
sometimes, you know?

16:00.060 --> 16:02.830
You got to take
what's in front of you.

16:53.950 --> 16:55.210
Dan.

16:55.210 --> 16:56.940
Hmm?

16:56.950 --> 17:00.150
Just so you know, she's only
going to give you 10 minutes.

17:03.560 --> 17:05.089
Can we talk privately?

17:05.089 --> 17:06.430
Leslie:
I'm doing this as a courtesy.

17:06.430 --> 17:08.430
If you've got something to say,
say it.

17:08.430 --> 17:11.000
Uh, my... my daughter... you
know what's going on with her?

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
- Yes.
- You... You know everything

17:13.000 --> 17:15.500
around the whole
Taylor Blaine case.

17:15.500 --> 17:17.329
I mean,
it's just... it's toxic.

17:17.339 --> 17:20.170
And what people think,
what they believe...

17:20.170 --> 17:22.069
It's a whole lot different
than the truth.

17:22.069 --> 17:25.440
The truth is that
Becca's a good girl.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.640
You know, if there's anything...
Maybe she's...

17:27.650 --> 17:30.580
Look, every kid makes mistakes.

17:30.580 --> 17:33.510
But you are so skilled
at teaching right from wrong

17:33.520 --> 17:35.960
and connecting with students
as people,

17:35.960 --> 17:38.150
not just as names on a ledger.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.190
Isn't that what you told me?

17:44.700 --> 17:48.370
My daughter needs help.

17:48.370 --> 17:53.270
I-I need people to speak to what
kind of person she really is.

17:53.270 --> 17:54.870
You know, I mean...

17:54.870 --> 17:56.000
you're in a good position.

17:56.010 --> 17:57.850
You were in a good position
not long ago.

17:57.850 --> 17:59.940
Someone asked you to speak
to what you know.

17:59.950 --> 18:01.680
What did you say about me?

18:01.680 --> 18:05.750
You said you understood why
someone would want to kill me.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.790
Your daughter is a drug dealer.

18:13.790 --> 18:17.220
Your team behaved like a gang.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.870
But you want me to waste what
capital I have attempting to...

18:19.870 --> 18:21.700
Look, I-I helped you get
to where you are.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.870
That means nothing? What you think you
did for me means absolutely nothing.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.210
- You have about five minutes.
- What means something

18:26.210 --> 18:28.540
is being in a position
to accomplish

18:28.540 --> 18:31.110
the things I need to
accomplish here.

18:33.550 --> 18:35.650
You won, Leslie.

18:35.650 --> 18:38.680
I... I-I-I know
what it's like to... to win.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.010
I-I-I know how good
it feels.

18:40.020 --> 18:41.820
And, you know, a lot of times,

18:41.820 --> 18:43.360
it gets in the way
of everything else.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.690
You got in your own way.
You lied.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.850
No, there's a difference
between lying and...

18:47.860 --> 18:48.990
And hiding the truth.

18:48.990 --> 18:50.550
One will get you caught,
the other one won't?

18:50.560 --> 18:52.520
- It's time to wrap this up.
- Shut up!

18:52.530 --> 18:55.760
I'm tr... I'm trying
to save my girl.

18:58.500 --> 19:00.630
I can't help you.

19:35.470 --> 19:36.800
Cammy: Hello.
This is Cammy Ross.

19:36.810 --> 19:39.210
Uh, Cammy, this is Dan Sullivan.

19:39.210 --> 19:41.210
We spoke a couple of weeks ago.

19:41.210 --> 19:43.710
Uh, you interviewed me
about Anne Blaine.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.820
Mm-hmm. What can I do for you,
Mr. Sullivan?

19:45.820 --> 19:47.990
Yeah. I-I've been, uh...
I've been reading these, uh...

19:47.990 --> 19:51.060
These articles that you wrote
about this, uh... this hacker,

19:51.060 --> 19:52.560
the one
who's going after Leyland,

19:52.560 --> 19:55.730
and I wanted to know
if you could, um...

19:55.730 --> 19:58.000
Well, I need to contact him.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.230
I can't really do that.

20:00.230 --> 20:02.490
He spoke to me in confidence.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.900
No.
I-I just need to talk to him.

20:04.900 --> 20:07.900
That's all. That's it.
It's, um...

20:09.010 --> 20:12.640
Look, uh,
you know what's going on.

20:12.640 --> 20:15.470
You know what's happening
with all our families.

20:15.480 --> 20:19.510
I really...
I-I just need to talk to him.

20:19.520 --> 20:23.520
Um, what I can do, I can
give him your contact info,

20:23.520 --> 20:25.780
and he can reach out to you
if he wants.

20:25.790 --> 20:28.950
Yeah, do that.
Yeah, please.

20:28.960 --> 20:30.520
Sebastian:
The stuff that's coming out now,

20:30.530 --> 20:32.870
personal stuff about
your family and others,

20:32.870 --> 20:34.800
I got nothing to do with that.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.930
Dan: Sure.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.930
I'm serious.
I got a code.

20:37.940 --> 20:39.340
I go after institutions.

20:39.340 --> 20:41.670
And, see, I-I-I don't mess
with people

20:41.670 --> 20:44.200
that are messing with my project.
Sebastian, I-I got to be straight with you.

20:44.210 --> 20:46.210
I'm a little tired of, uh, people
talking about their morals.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.170
Everybody's got
their principles,

20:48.180 --> 20:49.380
and their principles

20:49.380 --> 20:52.440
are dragging my daughter
closer to jail.

20:52.450 --> 20:55.480
So, you want to
take your project back?

20:55.490 --> 20:58.090
You want to go after
the people in power?

21:02.830 --> 21:06.100
These are Anne Blaine's
original medical records.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.870
Where did you get these?

21:09.870 --> 21:12.010
Eh, you know,
when they first went online,

21:12.010 --> 21:13.860
Leslie Graham
had me do some interviews.

21:13.870 --> 21:15.700
She basically walked me through
what to say.

21:15.710 --> 21:18.380
And I found it really odd
that she knew so much

21:18.380 --> 21:21.350
about something that had
just gone up online.

21:21.350 --> 21:23.350
And I asked her
about these documents,

21:23.350 --> 21:26.490
and she acted like she didn't
know what I was talking about.

21:26.490 --> 21:29.320
Now... Now,
I'm, um... I'm trusting.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.550
I-I really am.
Very trusting.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.830
But I'm not stupid.

21:33.830 --> 21:38.660
So you know,
Leslie... she's very careful.

21:38.660 --> 21:41.590
Any documents that might be
in her office end of the day,

21:41.600 --> 21:43.740
she'll shred them.

21:43.740 --> 21:45.940
It's an obsession.

21:45.940 --> 21:49.010
But I got my habits, too.

21:50.840 --> 21:53.500
What's that?

21:53.510 --> 21:55.370
I'm patient.

21:55.380 --> 21:57.620
I'm really damn patient.

22:19.810 --> 22:22.310
Peter:
What did the cops say?

22:22.310 --> 22:23.710
Nothing.

22:27.050 --> 22:29.280
Are you gonna go to jail?

22:29.280 --> 22:32.080
I don't know.

22:32.080 --> 22:34.950
If I do for him, maybe not.

22:34.950 --> 22:39.120
If I... I help him,
they'll probably let me off.

22:49.900 --> 22:53.660
So...

22:53.670 --> 22:55.800
what now?

22:55.810 --> 22:58.910
I don't know.

22:58.910 --> 23:01.380
Police are gonna do
what they're gonna do.

23:03.780 --> 23:07.510
I don't mean with them.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.490
What about...

23:09.490 --> 23:11.930
you and me and Dad?

23:13.790 --> 23:15.990
I don't want us to be
like how we are.

23:15.990 --> 23:19.160
Well, there's not much
you can do.

23:19.160 --> 23:22.130
Dad's clueless.
Mom's crazy.

23:22.130 --> 23:24.930
You... You get on
everybody else,

23:24.940 --> 23:26.040
but you're not perfect.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.880
You call me an ass...
'cause I'm gay.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.840
You write stuff about me
on the walls at your school,

23:30.840 --> 23:32.170
but you want what?
Want to hug me now?

23:32.180 --> 23:34.010
When I was with Mom, when
I was scared, you came for me.

23:34.010 --> 23:35.670
You want to tell me how much
you love me and miss me?

23:35.680 --> 23:38.510
You want every day to be like Christmas?
You and Dad, you came.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.850
It can be different.

24:03.010 --> 24:06.380
Remember...

24:06.380 --> 24:08.220
Remember when you and me
were gonna ride our bikes

24:08.220 --> 24:09.840
all the way to Chicago?
- Stop it.

24:09.850 --> 24:11.850
Grabbed a box of cereal,
bottle of water,

24:11.850 --> 24:13.250
threw them in a backpack?

24:15.050 --> 24:16.210
We got about a mile...

24:16.220 --> 24:18.780
Shut up. Shut up.

24:34.110 --> 24:36.010
We got about a mile,

24:36.010 --> 24:40.680
and then it got too dark
for us to see anything,

24:40.680 --> 24:44.120
and you told me to turn around.

24:46.180 --> 24:48.010
And we did.

25:08.910 --> 25:10.780
Eric Tanner's
in a position to testify

25:10.780 --> 25:13.110
that Wes and those other players
assaulted you.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.370
All you have to do
is confirm it in court.

25:17.450 --> 25:19.720
If I do, what happens?

25:19.720 --> 25:21.090
Anne:
Well, a jury hears that,

25:21.090 --> 25:22.790
they're gonna
see things different.

25:25.390 --> 25:27.430
They're gonna let me off?

25:27.430 --> 25:30.060
It'll have more effect
in the sentencing phase.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.660
They're gonna convict me.

25:32.660 --> 25:35.430
You committed
involuntary manslaughter.

25:35.430 --> 25:37.930
But there are clear,
mitigating circumstances

25:37.940 --> 25:41.140
that could reduce your sentence,
maybe remove it.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.240
Eric's testimony is compelling.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.000
What he tells a jury
will matter.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.350
How much time would I get
if I took a plea deal?

25:52.350 --> 25:54.020
- Why? Why would you do...
- How much time?

25:54.020 --> 25:56.060
- You don't need a deal.
- I'm talking to my lawyer.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.520
What's the best deal
you could get?

25:59.520 --> 26:01.020
The best.

26:01.030 --> 26:02.530
Maybe 10 years,

26:02.530 --> 26:04.800
five served,
less with supervision.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.770
That's a guess.

26:06.770 --> 26:08.470
Maybe five years.

26:08.470 --> 26:10.800
Served in prison.

26:10.800 --> 26:13.500
They're trying you as an adult.

26:17.540 --> 26:20.200
Can I talk to my mother, please?

26:32.690 --> 26:35.420
I don't want a trial.
I want to plead guilty.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.620
Taylor, listen to me.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.570
You're... You're...
You're almost there.

26:40.570 --> 26:42.040
All you have to do
is you go into court...

26:42.040 --> 26:45.500
Tell them I got attacked,
that I got beat up?

26:45.500 --> 26:47.200
You were.

26:47.210 --> 26:50.880
I go into that room one more
time and act like a victim.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.050
You were victimized.
That doesn't mean...

26:53.050 --> 26:55.240
How do you think
it makes me feel

26:55.250 --> 26:58.950
to have my future depend
on the guy who raped me?

27:00.320 --> 27:03.320
He raped me, and he...

27:04.520 --> 27:05.880
He gets to be my savior?

27:05.890 --> 27:07.720
He gets to put on a suit
and go into court

27:07.730 --> 27:09.490
and talk about
how he's gonna do right?

27:09.490 --> 27:11.130
Well, he's... he's...
He's gonna help you.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.700
The same guy who held me down
and assaulted me

27:14.700 --> 27:16.270
gets to act like he give a...

27:16.270 --> 27:19.170
He's just
trying to save himself.

27:19.170 --> 27:22.310
Why don't you want him
in court with you?

27:23.940 --> 27:26.940
I mean, are you...

27:28.680 --> 27:30.850
Are you trying to
punish yourself?

27:37.890 --> 27:41.860
The posters in your room,
the e-mails you sent around,

27:41.860 --> 27:44.430
being violent,
being destructive...

27:44.430 --> 27:47.670
Is that really what you want?

27:51.900 --> 27:55.300
You know,
when that gun went off,

27:55.310 --> 27:57.380
for the first time
since that party,

27:57.380 --> 27:59.950
I stopped feeling like a victim.

28:02.950 --> 28:04.750
Did you mean to shoot that boy?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.050
- Doesn't matter.
- Yes, it matters.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.480
No, I'm not talking about
what I was trying to do.

28:07.490 --> 28:09.660
I'm talking about
how I felt after.

28:09.660 --> 28:11.720
I'm standing up,
somebody else is on the ground,

28:11.720 --> 28:13.920
I'm walking away,
not feeling like a victim,

28:13.930 --> 28:17.230
not being the one getting beat,
getting raped.

28:18.760 --> 28:20.790
It felt good.

28:22.670 --> 28:26.470
So not putting this on a jury

28:26.470 --> 28:30.070
or my rapist

28:30.080 --> 28:33.350
and not making it about you,

28:33.350 --> 28:34.510
that feels good.

28:34.510 --> 28:37.740
Serving 10 years
so you can feel good?

28:37.750 --> 28:40.090
I can't let you do that.

28:41.190 --> 28:43.920
None of this is your fault, Mom.

28:46.860 --> 28:50.500
I don't feel guilty.

28:50.500 --> 28:53.030
I'm taking responsibility.

28:53.030 --> 28:55.660
Everyone else is taking theirs.

28:55.670 --> 28:59.340
I know you want to own up
to what is yours,

28:59.340 --> 29:02.540
but you can't go into court
and take the guilt.

29:29.130 --> 29:30.290
Leslie:
It's a lie. This is a lie.

29:30.300 --> 29:31.700
I didn't post that woman's
medical records online.

29:31.700 --> 29:33.960
Dan is saying
they came from your office.

29:33.970 --> 29:36.000
That's not possible.

29:36.010 --> 29:39.540
Dan is being petty.
He's being vindictive.

29:39.540 --> 29:41.570
He's going public.
He's willing to testify.

29:41.580 --> 29:42.650
Well, that means what?

29:42.650 --> 29:44.420
A liar's willing to lie
on the record?

29:44.420 --> 29:47.190
He gives those to some
faceless hacker to post online,

29:47.190 --> 29:48.520
that makes any of it true?

29:48.520 --> 29:50.390
He's just...
He's lashing out.

29:50.390 --> 29:52.390
He doesn't care who he hurts.

29:52.390 --> 29:53.660
We'll investigate that.

29:53.660 --> 29:55.530
Well, you're damn right
we'll investigate it.

29:55.530 --> 29:57.230
If that's how
he wants to play things,

29:57.230 --> 29:58.700
boy, he doesn't know
what hurt is.

29:58.700 --> 30:00.900
Leslie,<i> we'll</i> investigate,

30:00.900 --> 30:03.000
and when we make a determination

30:03.000 --> 30:04.590
about the authenticity
of the material...

30:04.600 --> 30:06.400
W-W-W-W-Wait. Hold on.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.400
The interim trustee's decided
the best thing for the school

30:09.410 --> 30:11.010
would be for you to step down

30:11.010 --> 30:13.880
until we can determine
if Dan's allegations hold merit.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.380
If...

30:15.380 --> 30:16.780
You mean you believe him?

30:18.220 --> 30:20.120
We're concerned
about how this can impact

30:20.120 --> 30:21.960
Anne Blaine's suit
against the school.

30:24.020 --> 30:27.180
Do you really think
I would do anything like this?

30:27.190 --> 30:31.190
I'm careful.
I am <i> very</i> careful.

30:31.200 --> 30:32.530
Are you saying
you wouldn't have done this,

30:32.530 --> 30:35.270
or are you saying
you wouldn't have gotten caught?

30:41.970 --> 30:43.370
May I speak to Dan?

30:43.370 --> 30:44.530
No.

30:44.540 --> 30:45.870
Just for a minute.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.050
If you don't leave right now,
I'll call the police.

30:48.050 --> 30:50.250
Steph.

30:50.250 --> 30:51.720
Let me talk to her.

30:51.720 --> 30:54.220
Not in the house.
She's not coming in the house.

30:59.590 --> 31:02.890
The lawyer thinks Becca
will get 12 months in detention,

31:02.890 --> 31:04.990
probation after that.

31:05.000 --> 31:08.400
Could've been better if we had
more people speaking up for her.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.340
Becca's going to be all right.

31:10.340 --> 31:12.140
She is.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.840
So, what you're doing,

31:14.840 --> 31:16.980
trying to hurt people
indiscriminately...

31:16.980 --> 31:20.050
Oh, I've been very focused
on who I want to hurt.

31:23.010 --> 31:24.510
It's not just me.

31:24.520 --> 31:27.450
You've given that woman
ammunition against Leyland.

31:27.450 --> 31:30.110
It's made it harder for
the whole school to recover,

31:30.120 --> 31:31.480
for every family there to...

31:31.490 --> 31:34.030
Yeah, they'll all be looking at
themselves a whole lot harder.

31:34.030 --> 31:35.360
Maybe if you and me
had done that,

31:35.360 --> 31:37.430
we wouldn't be
standing here now.

31:37.430 --> 31:39.030
You didn't do the right thing.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.100
All you care about is winning.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.000
The story plays really well,
though.

31:47.010 --> 31:50.610
Heartbroken father
who builds ships in a bottle

31:50.610 --> 31:53.140
reconstructs
incriminating evidence

31:53.140 --> 31:56.910
so he may speak truth to power.

31:58.880 --> 32:01.850
But sooner or later,
people are gonna put together

32:01.850 --> 32:04.850
his wife manipulates images
for a living.

32:04.860 --> 32:10.200
So they create some documents,
shred them,

32:10.200 --> 32:14.570
then put them back together.

32:14.570 --> 32:18.000
That is a good story.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.460
That doesn't make it the truth.

32:21.470 --> 32:24.070
Take the blame, Leslie.

32:24.080 --> 32:27.710
Take it with you when you go.

32:27.710 --> 32:30.140
Give the school a fresh start.

32:52.900 --> 32:55.600
Here. Let me see.

32:55.610 --> 32:57.640
All right.

33:00.250 --> 33:01.950
All right, you got it right.

33:01.950 --> 33:03.780
You just got to show me
how you got that, all right?

33:03.780 --> 33:05.380
Okay.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.370
<i>All right, you got it right.</i>

33:19.370 --> 33:21.790
<i>You just got to show me
how you got that, all right?</i>

33:21.800 --> 33:23.140
<i>Okay.</i>

33:28.540 --> 33:29.770
Hey, wait.

33:29.770 --> 33:31.570
Come on, girls. Let's go.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.480
Get your stuff.
Get your boots, and let's go.

33:33.480 --> 33:34.910
Mia, Mercy, hurry up!

33:34.910 --> 33:37.170
Hurry up, now!
Get your bags!

33:55.970 --> 33:58.640
Anderson: This isn't
a comfortable conversation.

33:58.640 --> 34:02.010
We've known each other
a long time.

34:02.010 --> 34:03.340
I want you to know
what's happening now,

34:03.340 --> 34:05.800
it's a business decision.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.780
Your family's gone through
a lot,

34:07.780 --> 34:10.520
but there are things
that have come out online...

34:10.520 --> 34:12.150
Okay, let me stop you.

34:12.150 --> 34:15.690
My son has ben exonerated
in connection with this assault.

34:15.690 --> 34:17.090
- Terri...
- Hold on.

34:17.090 --> 34:19.260
Kevin has been cleared,

34:19.260 --> 34:21.530
and as far as we know,
those medical records,

34:21.530 --> 34:23.159
they came from
The Leyland School.

34:23.159 --> 34:25.020
So anything anybody's saying
about Michael...

34:25.030 --> 34:27.330
This isn't about
your son or your husband.

34:28.870 --> 34:30.940
There are any number
of e-mails out there

34:30.940 --> 34:33.639
where you say some pretty...

34:33.639 --> 34:35.840
They're ugly things
about people,

34:35.840 --> 34:38.840
particularly...

34:38.840 --> 34:40.540
particularly whites.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.880
My family has been through
an ordeal,

34:43.880 --> 34:47.040
and you want to talk to me
about personal e-mails?

34:51.790 --> 34:53.760
Okay.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.660
There are...

35:03.970 --> 35:06.400
For people of color,

35:06.400 --> 35:10.370
there's a world that we live in
that's different than yours.

35:10.380 --> 35:12.880
One you'll never, ever experience.
Terri...

35:12.880 --> 35:17.720
And the way we express those
experiences, out of context,

35:17.720 --> 35:20.650
can be taken to mean something
that they don't.

35:20.650 --> 35:22.910
I wouldn't want anyone
going through my e-mails...

35:24.590 --> 35:26.030
but you talk about white trash,

35:26.030 --> 35:27.680
y-you talk about
white entitlement.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.150
That's nothing compared to
what my family

35:30.160 --> 35:34.060
and families like ours
deal with daily...

35:34.070 --> 35:38.000
Money or not, status or not,
we deal.

35:39.340 --> 35:42.540
And it may not sound correct,

35:42.540 --> 35:44.340
but I have a right
to my privacy.

35:44.340 --> 35:47.500
You do, but this is
a publicly held company.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.370
We told the truth.

35:51.380 --> 35:54.180
You're gonna punish us for that?

35:55.390 --> 35:57.860
No one's talking "punish."

36:01.030 --> 36:03.800
All we're taking about
is giving you and your family

36:03.800 --> 36:06.130
an opportunity to reset.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.530
Where?

36:11.540 --> 36:13.770
St. Louis.

36:13.770 --> 36:18.130
It would be a lateral move
in pay but with a reduced title.

36:18.140 --> 36:21.810
Well...

36:21.810 --> 36:24.610
I don't know
if that's going to work.

36:26.080 --> 36:29.210
It's what's being offered.

36:29.220 --> 36:34.090
The only other thing on the
table is a severance package.

36:34.090 --> 36:36.850
I'm sorry.

36:41.170 --> 36:42.240
Michael: Not happening.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.760
It's not... not going down
like this. No.

36:44.770 --> 36:48.070
Take Kevin out of school
senior year?

36:48.070 --> 36:49.600
No, we're gonna
get our lawyer on it,

36:49.610 --> 36:51.510
and we're gonna fight this.

36:51.510 --> 36:54.650
If these people just think
they can just run us off...

36:56.310 --> 36:59.240
Michael:
And for what? E-mails?

36:59.250 --> 37:01.420
E-mails.

37:02.450 --> 37:04.850
Senior year.

37:04.860 --> 37:07.260
Supposed to be his best one.

37:13.030 --> 37:19.040
Well, what it was
isn't how it is.

37:36.220 --> 37:38.890
Kevin: You okay?

37:41.190 --> 37:43.250
You and Dad okay?

37:46.130 --> 37:50.030
We're going to be okay.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.570
You know, I'm really, uh...

37:54.570 --> 37:58.870
I'm... I'm really sorry...
about everything...

37:58.880 --> 38:02.880
That night, the things I did,
things that happened.

38:04.150 --> 38:06.220
Now everybody's
coming after you.

38:06.220 --> 38:09.220
Mm.
Not coming after.

38:09.220 --> 38:12.390
Things are catching up to us.

38:12.390 --> 38:15.430
Well...
Well, I'm not afraid.

38:15.430 --> 38:18.330
You know, if we got to go to
St. Louis or...

38:18.330 --> 38:20.600
I don't know
what's going to happen.

38:24.100 --> 38:26.600
Dad was telling me one time

38:26.600 --> 38:29.930
why he designs the way he does.

38:29.940 --> 38:32.900
It's... You got to make the most
out of what you have, right?

38:32.910 --> 38:37.210
So I just feel like
whatever we got,

38:37.210 --> 38:39.280
we can handle it.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.200
What?

38:54.200 --> 38:58.100
I love you.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.430
I love you, too.

39:10.450 --> 39:13.820
Butler: There are few people
who possess the traits necessary

39:13.820 --> 39:17.620
to be a leader
in private education.

39:17.620 --> 39:19.380
This is one such person.

39:19.390 --> 39:21.490
I'm proud to say
he's our new Head of School.

39:21.490 --> 39:23.450
Welcome, please,
Dominic Calderon.

39:29.770 --> 39:31.640
Dominic: Thank you, Senator.

39:31.640 --> 39:32.770
I am very thrilled

39:32.770 --> 39:34.970
to be standing here
in front of you all.

39:34.970 --> 39:38.300
The Leyland School is one
that I have admired for years.

39:38.310 --> 39:40.010
So to have been chosen now

39:40.010 --> 39:44.170
as your new Head of School
is truly an honor.

39:44.180 --> 39:46.510
And you all have had to weather

39:46.520 --> 39:49.490
some very difficult times
recently,

39:49.490 --> 39:52.190
but I believe that the character
of The Leyland School

39:52.190 --> 39:55.030
has persevered.

39:55.030 --> 39:57.560
There's a tradition
of excellence here.

39:59.300 --> 40:03.000
A tradition
that can only be enhanced

40:03.000 --> 40:06.270
as the school continues to grow.

40:09.810 --> 40:15.010
The future of The Leyland School
is the future of education,

40:15.010 --> 40:19.580
a future that we can all
arrive at together.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.630
Judge Isaacs: Now is the time,
and this is the place,

40:41.640 --> 40:44.380
for you to be held accountable
for your actions.

40:44.380 --> 40:47.250
Taylor Blaine,
you are charged with murder

40:47.250 --> 40:49.810
by means of
involuntary manslaughter.

40:49.810 --> 40:51.370
This is a Level 1 felony,

40:51.380 --> 40:54.240
punishable
up to 30 years in prison.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.480
Do you understand
the charges you are facing?

40:56.490 --> 40:58.520
I do.

40:58.520 --> 41:00.020
Has your counsel
explained to you

41:00.020 --> 41:01.980
that by accepting
a plea agreement,

41:01.990 --> 41:04.090
you will waive your right
to a jury trial?

41:07.000 --> 41:09.170
She did.

41:09.170 --> 41:12.340
And do you understand that
if you accept this agreement,

41:12.340 --> 41:15.840
you will be sentenced to a term
of no less than 10 years

41:15.840 --> 41:18.480
in a state-mandated facility?

41:21.250 --> 41:24.050
I understand.

41:26.750 --> 41:29.850
♪♪

41:42.870 --> 41:46.970
I ask that you carefully
consider your decision.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.810
Once made,
it cannot be rescinded.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.910
At this time, Taylor,
do you accept or reject

41:55.910 --> 41:58.410
that which has been presented
to you?
