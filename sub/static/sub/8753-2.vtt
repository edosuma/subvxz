WEBVTT

00:10.892 --> 00:14.913
They orchestrate very violent, bad things.

00:14.915 --> 00:17.662
Something's trying to harm my child.

00:17.664 --> 00:20.240
He causes physical pain.

00:20.242 --> 00:22.116
Did you fall down the whole flight?

00:22.218 --> 00:23.521
I was pushed.

00:23.523 --> 00:26.831
It was able to manipulate
people's minds like puppets.

00:26.833 --> 00:30.873
Out of 13 children, only 6
of them lived to adulthood.

00:30.875 --> 00:32.914
These kids... they're from hell.

00:32.916 --> 00:37.674
I don't think this place
is good for anybody.

00:37.676 --> 00:40.178
You're mine. You can't escape.

00:40.180 --> 00:42.217
My name is Amy Allan.

00:43.357 --> 00:45.128
What's happening?

00:45.130 --> 00:46.405
I see dead people.

00:46.407 --> 00:48.851
It seems like a devil.

00:48.853 --> 00:50.896
I speak to dead people.

00:50.898 --> 00:52.366
He's pissed off.

00:52.368 --> 00:53.703
And they speak to me.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.609
I felt real fear.

00:55.611 --> 00:58.857
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.164
I think she's being murdered.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.271
I rely on my partner.

01:02.273 --> 01:03.611
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

01:03.613 --> 01:06.418
I'm a retired New York
City homicide detective.

01:06.420 --> 01:07.787
Serial killer pops in my head.

01:07.789 --> 01:10.897
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:10.899 --> 01:12.101
Nobody believes me.

01:12.103 --> 01:13.642
It's my job to reveal them.

01:13.644 --> 01:15.912
- Do you think there's still bodies there?
- I do.

01:15.914 --> 01:17.519
But Steve and I never speak...

01:17.521 --> 01:19.491
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:19.493 --> 01:20.827
Until the very end.

01:20.829 --> 01:22.699
You got problems. I got news for you.

01:22.701 --> 01:24.707
When we uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:24.709 --> 01:26.711
This is our house, whether
they like it or not.

01:26.713 --> 01:28.650
Or time to get out.

01:28.652 --> 01:30.889
This is their house, the house of the dead.

01:48.995 --> 01:50.930
I'm in St. Louis, Missouri.

01:50.932 --> 01:54.205
A woman named Shanan practically
begged us to come out here.

01:54.207 --> 01:57.878
She told me she lived in a
house that had a ton of activity.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.817
A few months ago, she had enough.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.721
She picked up her four kids
and moved the hell out of there.

02:02.723 --> 02:05.293
Problem is, her sister refuses to leave.

02:05.295 --> 02:06.531
She's there all alone,

02:06.533 --> 02:08.633
and Shanan thinks that
her life is in danger.

02:15.046 --> 02:16.713
Before Amy arrives,

02:16.715 --> 02:19.485
I look for anything that
might influence her findings.

02:20.958 --> 02:23.194
This house has a lot of family photos.

02:23.196 --> 02:25.265
Once they're covered or removed,

02:25.267 --> 02:27.773
the location will be
ready for tonight's walk.

02:43.566 --> 02:45.035
Okay.

02:47.140 --> 02:53.116
Someone here... and I think
it's this tall, scary man...

02:53.118 --> 02:56.687
he's able to manipulate the living body,

02:56.689 --> 03:00.795
like he can cause
physical pain in the body.

03:00.797 --> 03:05.803
He's a real... Freak.

03:13.117 --> 03:14.217
What's wrong?

03:14.219 --> 03:16.787
He is pretty [Bleep] powerful.

03:16.789 --> 03:19.556
Eh, I'm concerned...

03:29.804 --> 03:32.004
Shanan, you sounded
pretty upset on the phone.

03:32.006 --> 03:33.371
- Yes.
- Okay.

03:33.373 --> 03:35.272
So why don't you give me
an idea of what's going on?

03:35.274 --> 03:36.476
Three years ago,

03:36.478 --> 03:39.678
me and my children moved
in the home with my sister,

03:39.680 --> 03:42.080
and little things just started happening...

03:42.082 --> 03:44.585
noises, footsteps,

03:44.587 --> 03:48.386
and then everything just
started to get physical.

03:48.388 --> 03:51.455
Okay, what happened?

03:51.457 --> 03:54.727
Hailey, my 10-year-old,
was hit with an object.

03:54.729 --> 03:55.995
Is this a picture of them?

03:55.997 --> 03:57.597
Yes.

03:57.599 --> 03:58.731
- And that's her?
- Yes.

03:58.733 --> 04:00.166
- This one right here?
- In the purple.

04:00.168 --> 04:05.537
This brush came from nowhere
and just hit her in the back.

04:05.539 --> 04:06.870
And you witnessed this?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.438
We all witnessed it.

04:08.440 --> 04:11.307
After that, I couldn't take any more.

04:11.309 --> 04:12.774
It terrified me,

04:12.776 --> 04:14.842
because something's
trying to harm my child.

04:14.844 --> 04:16.576
That was the last straw.

04:16.577 --> 04:19.576
I just told my sister I
cannot put up with this.

04:19.577 --> 04:21.344
I will not.

04:21.346 --> 04:22.444
That's when you were
like, "I'm out of here."

04:22.446 --> 04:23.812
Yes.

04:23.814 --> 04:25.512
You're picking on a
10-year-old little girl?

04:25.514 --> 04:27.380
I mean, that pisses me
off just thinking about it.

04:27.382 --> 04:28.781
Right. That's why I called you guys.

04:28.783 --> 04:32.650
Since we have moved out,
my sister is in more danger.

04:32.652 --> 04:34.083
It's gotten worse.

04:34.085 --> 04:35.716
She's been pushed down stairs.

04:35.718 --> 04:37.785
Is she all right?

04:37.787 --> 04:39.287
She was hurt.

04:39.289 --> 04:42.856
Like, she had a cast on for weeks.

04:42.858 --> 04:45.057
What do you think's going on?

04:45.059 --> 04:46.790
It might be targeting her,

04:46.792 --> 04:49.755
and I'm worried about
her living here alone.

04:49.757 --> 04:51.255
Okay.

04:52.457 --> 04:54.125
This tall guy...

04:54.127 --> 04:57.458
he's able to interact like a living person.

04:59.092 --> 05:02.760
So, I did see something
with him and a child.

05:02.762 --> 05:09.232
He'll come out of the dark,
and he takes off his skin...

05:09.234 --> 05:11.731
Like reaching for the kid,

05:11.733 --> 05:12.932
and the kid's all, like, scared.

05:12.934 --> 05:14.066
Ugh.

05:25.904 --> 05:28.038
The guy... he's [Bleep] pissed.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.974
He says, "get the [Bleep] out."

05:38.181 --> 05:40.348
Okay, so what's going on in here?

05:40.350 --> 05:42.787
This might sound strange,

05:42.789 --> 05:44.854
but we have all been sitting in this room,

05:44.856 --> 05:46.121
watching television,

05:46.123 --> 05:49.527
and coins would fly out
of nowhere and hit you.

05:49.529 --> 05:50.762
Like quarters, dimes, that type of thing?

05:50.764 --> 05:51.830
Right.

05:51.832 --> 05:52.797
Are you sure it's not the kids

05:52.799 --> 05:53.698
playing around with each other?

05:53.700 --> 05:55.033
Absolutely not.

05:55.035 --> 05:57.033
And why do you say that?

05:57.035 --> 05:58.801
Because we're all together,

05:58.803 --> 06:01.140
and I would be able to see

06:01.142 --> 06:04.808
if someone physically
threw something at someone.

06:04.810 --> 06:05.708
That is strange.

06:05.710 --> 06:06.808
Yes.

06:06.810 --> 06:08.608
Okay. Anything else down here?

06:08.610 --> 06:10.176
This is one thing

06:10.178 --> 06:13.914
that really makes me emotional to this day.

06:13.916 --> 06:16.048
I am sitting here.

06:16.050 --> 06:21.250
As I look toward this way,
apparitions came to me,

06:21.252 --> 06:23.684
one after the other, like a parade,

06:23.686 --> 06:26.185
like they were trying to get to me.

06:26.187 --> 06:29.486
Now, describe the apparitions.

06:29.488 --> 06:31.621
The first one, it was like a gladiator.

06:31.623 --> 06:33.557
After the gladiator,

06:33.559 --> 06:35.995
there was like a...

06:35.997 --> 06:38.695
he was like an Indian,
like an American Indian.

06:38.697 --> 06:41.064
And then there was another one.

06:41.066 --> 06:44.135
It was just a white, like, tall, long mist.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.504
I'm shaking right now. I'm sorry.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.205
No, it's okay. I can see that.

06:48.207 --> 06:53.142
Yeah. I'm shaking because
I'm just remembering this.

06:53.144 --> 06:55.947
And I was crying profusely.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.815
I have to ask, were you
cocktailing that night

06:57.817 --> 06:59.150
- or anything like that?
- No, no.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.719
Were you in and out of dreaming maybe?

07:01.721 --> 07:03.188
No. I was alert.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.957
Now, I know you experienced this.

07:04.959 --> 07:06.559
Now your sister's here alone.

07:06.561 --> 07:08.728
You worried about her going
through that by herself?

07:08.730 --> 07:09.762
Yes, I do,

07:09.764 --> 07:12.832
because I just need her to realize

07:12.834 --> 07:15.002
what's actually going on.

07:15.004 --> 07:16.038
It's not a game.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.072
It's not.

07:22.978 --> 07:25.145
That guy is here.

07:25.147 --> 07:26.178
Who?

07:26.180 --> 07:27.913
The tall one.

07:31.687 --> 07:33.721
Do you know if he
interacts with the living?

07:33.723 --> 07:35.590
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- How?

07:35.592 --> 07:37.493
I would think that the
living would see him.

07:37.495 --> 07:41.829
He's able to manipulate
people's minds like puppets

07:41.831 --> 07:44.531
and cause them to hallucinate.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.503
Don't know what they're seeing.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.971
Are you worried he might be manipulating

07:52.973 --> 07:54.605
what you're perceiving?

07:54.607 --> 07:56.374
I am.

07:57.709 --> 08:01.578
And there is a whole bunch of kids.

08:01.580 --> 08:04.282
And what are they doing?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.517
They make a lot of ruckus.

08:05.519 --> 08:07.117
They're loud. They're annoying.

08:07.119 --> 08:08.685
They're creepy. You hear them.

08:08.687 --> 08:12.125
One weird thing about this guy...

08:12.127 --> 08:14.027
he doesn't like them little things.

08:14.029 --> 08:16.662
-
- He thinks that they're from hell.

08:26.244 --> 08:28.546
So, Hailey, I was talking to mom today,

08:28.548 --> 08:30.414
and she told me about an
incident that happened to you

08:30.416 --> 08:31.015
with the hairbrush.

08:31.017 --> 08:31.686
Yeah.

08:31.688 --> 08:33.187
Can you tell me what happened?

08:33.289 --> 08:36.121
We were on our way to go to school,

08:36.123 --> 08:38.855
and we were all by the front door.

08:38.857 --> 08:42.594
And then a push... it came
and hit me on the side.

08:42.596 --> 08:45.229
And then I thought it was my brother,

08:45.231 --> 08:48.530
and I was yelling at him
and getting mad at him.

08:48.532 --> 08:49.898
And then my teacher...

08:49.900 --> 08:52.768
she said it wasn't him
because he was behind me.

08:52.770 --> 08:54.269
Okay, did it hit you hard?

08:54.271 --> 08:55.137
Yeah.

08:55.139 --> 08:56.905
Did you get scared when that happened?

08:56.907 --> 08:58.073
Yeah.

08:58.075 --> 08:59.942
So, are you worried about your aunt?

08:59.944 --> 09:02.743
She's scared, too.

09:02.745 --> 09:04.312
- But she won't tell you?
- No.

09:04.314 --> 09:05.646
Now, would you come back to live here

09:05.648 --> 09:07.447
if we could figure out what's going on?

09:07.449 --> 09:10.019
Mm... No.

09:10.021 --> 09:11.222
Okay.

09:13.690 --> 09:19.899
These kids orchestrate really
very, very violent, bad things.

09:21.767 --> 09:23.603
They're malicious.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.272
I got to get out of here.

09:25.274 --> 09:28.072
Really weird, and I don't like it.

09:28.074 --> 09:31.576
I don't think this place is good for kids.

09:31.578 --> 09:35.744
I don't think this [Bleep]
place is good for anybody.

09:57.271 --> 09:59.707
Well, Krystal, it's good
to finally talk with you.

09:59.709 --> 10:01.443
I spoke with your sister.

10:01.445 --> 10:03.579
I spoke with some other family members.

10:03.581 --> 10:04.747
They all want you out of here.

10:04.749 --> 10:06.582
Yeah.

10:06.584 --> 10:08.718
They're all gone.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.887
And they feel it's unsafe for you here.

10:10.889 --> 10:13.022
I got to ask you, why are you staying?

10:13.024 --> 10:15.693
What's the draw to the
house that you won't leave?

10:15.695 --> 10:19.398
I've put so much time into this house.

10:19.400 --> 10:23.201
It took me two years to make it livable.

10:23.203 --> 10:25.203
How long ago did you buy it?

10:25.205 --> 10:27.305
It's been about six years now.

10:27.307 --> 10:29.705
Now, do you know any
history about the house?

10:29.707 --> 10:30.373
No.

10:30.375 --> 10:32.041
Your sister mentioned to me

10:32.043 --> 10:33.279
that since she's moved out with the kids

10:33.281 --> 10:35.515
that activity's gotten
worse. Is that right?

10:35.517 --> 10:38.417
Yes. I definitely think
it's gotten a lot worse

10:38.419 --> 10:39.353
since she's been gone.

10:39.355 --> 10:42.523
It's like everything's
being directed at one person

10:42.525 --> 10:45.592
instead of six. There were six of us.

10:45.594 --> 10:47.727
Okay. How is that affecting you?

10:47.729 --> 10:49.295
I just don't feel like myself.

10:49.297 --> 10:51.631
You know, sometimes I'm very moody.

10:51.633 --> 10:54.735
Sometimes I'm very
angry, just for no reason,

10:54.737 --> 10:55.871
or depressed.

10:55.873 --> 10:58.508
When you're away from the house
for a day or two, let's say,

10:58.510 --> 10:59.810
you feel better?

10:59.812 --> 11:01.044
Yeah.

11:07.153 --> 11:10.390
There is this older guy, and he's sick.

11:10.392 --> 11:13.964
He... you feel it.

11:13.966 --> 11:16.600
He died here.

11:16.602 --> 11:22.138
He's very depressed,

11:22.140 --> 11:26.308
very, very, very lonely.

11:27.378 --> 11:32.552
He feels like he was just
abandoned and left to die.

11:32.554 --> 11:34.657
He picks a spot,

11:34.659 --> 11:37.826
and he stays there for a while.

11:37.828 --> 11:41.229
One day this room will be bad,

11:41.231 --> 11:43.798
and then like next week,
it will be downstairs.

11:43.900 --> 11:45.599
Bad?

11:45.601 --> 11:47.464
Yeah. The person will be...

11:47.866 --> 11:49.597
they spend time in there,

11:49.599 --> 11:52.332
they'll feel really, really depressed.

11:59.540 --> 12:01.207
So, what's going on in here?

12:01.209 --> 12:04.141
I have experienced a lot
of scary things in here,

12:04.143 --> 12:07.410
and it keeps me from being able to sleep.

12:07.412 --> 12:11.248
When I close my eyes, I
see really horrible images.

12:11.250 --> 12:13.985
So, what do these images look like?

12:13.987 --> 12:16.521
In each instance, they're black,

12:16.523 --> 12:19.957
like really, really
black, like burned almost.

12:19.959 --> 12:21.524
Now, do you watch horror movies at night?

12:21.526 --> 12:22.525
No, not at night.

12:22.527 --> 12:24.228
And I've never seen anything

12:24.230 --> 12:26.932
like these things that I
see when I close my eyes.

12:26.934 --> 12:28.567
What else is going on up in here?

12:28.569 --> 12:30.970
Oh, my bed shakes.

12:30.972 --> 12:33.510
The first time it happened, I
thought it was an earthquake,

12:33.512 --> 12:35.411
but nothing else was shaking but the bed.

12:35.413 --> 12:38.013
Show me how it shook, how
hard. What are we talking about?

12:38.015 --> 12:39.714
Well, I was kind of sitting like this,

12:39.716 --> 12:41.749
and then I just started moving like this,

12:41.751 --> 12:44.951
like somebody was, like, on the other end,

12:44.953 --> 12:46.389
like pushing it.

12:46.691 --> 12:48.358
I know you have a small dog.

12:48.360 --> 12:50.327
- Any other big animals?
- No.

12:50.329 --> 12:52.796
Is it heavy enough that if
somebody was pushing on the bed,

12:52.798 --> 12:54.496
it would have to be an
adult, or could a kid do it?

12:54.498 --> 12:56.230
It would definitely have to be an adult.

12:56.232 --> 12:58.400
How the hell are you sleeping in here?

12:58.402 --> 13:00.268
I really don't sleep.

13:00.270 --> 13:01.469
That's not good.

13:01.871 --> 13:03.069
That's gonna take its toll eventually.

13:03.071 --> 13:04.834
Mm-hmm. It already has.

13:09.640 --> 13:14.245
This tall, scary man... he does stuff.

13:14.247 --> 13:15.478
You know what I'm saying?

13:15.480 --> 13:17.246
He's super smart.

13:17.248 --> 13:19.116
He can manipulate the body.

13:19.118 --> 13:20.951
He's a very physical presence.

13:20.953 --> 13:25.354
He's able to interact like a living person.

13:25.356 --> 13:28.624
He's like, "I'm the least of the worries."

13:28.626 --> 13:31.959
No, you're a problem.

13:34.426 --> 13:37.990
He's, you know, kind of...

13:37.992 --> 13:40.360
Like torturing people
to get them out of here

13:40.362 --> 13:41.960
because of these kids.

13:41.962 --> 13:43.794
So he thinks he's helping the living

13:43.796 --> 13:46.568
to get them to leave here
before something happens to them?

13:46.570 --> 13:48.371
Yes, he does.

13:48.373 --> 13:51.307
He does believe that.

13:52.642 --> 13:55.176
We haven't talked about
why I'm really here.

13:55.178 --> 13:57.610
- The staircase.
- Yeah.

14:01.617 --> 14:04.284
So, did you fall down the whole flight?

14:04.286 --> 14:05.517
The whole flight.

14:05.519 --> 14:08.452
I usually don't stand here very often,

14:08.454 --> 14:10.621
'cause it's really scary.

14:10.623 --> 14:12.122
Okay, take me through what happened.

14:12.124 --> 14:15.325
So, basically, I just walked up the steps,

14:15.327 --> 14:20.997
and then, all of a sudden,
I... fell down the stairs.

14:20.999 --> 14:24.000
And I apparently did a cartwheel.

14:24.002 --> 14:26.202
You can even see where
the bottom of my shoe

14:26.204 --> 14:27.704
made a mark on the wall.

14:27.706 --> 14:32.510
And then I fractured my elbow
at the bottom of the stairs.

14:32.512 --> 14:34.445
How do you think you fell?

14:34.447 --> 14:36.846
It's hard for me to say this,

14:36.848 --> 14:38.749
but I think that I was pushed...

14:40.955 --> 14:43.054
because I fell really hard.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.255
I'm really concerned for you.

14:44.257 --> 14:46.428
- You're here alone.
- Yeah.

14:46.430 --> 14:48.431
And you're not sleeping.

14:48.433 --> 14:49.734
You're almost killed.

14:49.736 --> 14:50.935
That would have killed most people.

14:50.937 --> 14:54.271
Yeah. One of the kids
probably wouldn't have made it.

14:58.382 --> 15:01.487
These little kids that are here...

15:01.489 --> 15:04.325
they were not right.

15:04.327 --> 15:08.433
They weren't normal when they were alive,

15:08.435 --> 15:14.272
and I think that they...

15:14.274 --> 15:17.411
are really damaged now.

15:23.886 --> 15:26.787
What do these kids do?

15:26.789 --> 15:30.295
They make big things happen...

15:30.297 --> 15:31.894
over time.

15:31.896 --> 15:38.332
They cause really very,
very violent, bad things...

15:38.334 --> 15:40.034
to happen.

15:40.036 --> 15:46.178
"Catastrophe" is the word
that I hear being used.

15:47.546 --> 15:48.713
I don't like this.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.382
I don't like this.

16:04.637 --> 16:06.472
Usually, clients know a little bit

16:06.474 --> 16:08.207
about the history of their property.

16:08.209 --> 16:10.611
Krystal doesn't have a clue.

16:10.613 --> 16:12.148
So I started from the beginning

16:12.150 --> 16:14.546
and tracked down the
original owner of the land,

16:14.548 --> 16:15.881
a guy named B.W. Alexander.

16:15.883 --> 16:18.351
And when I reached out
to one of his descendants,

16:18.353 --> 16:20.453
she said we definitely needed to talk.

16:26.520 --> 16:29.220
Marcia, thanks for meeting
with me. I appreciate that.

16:29.222 --> 16:32.621
Now, you're a descendant of B.W. Alexander.

16:32.723 --> 16:35.789
Basil William Alexander was
my third great grandfather.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.224
What can you tell me about him?

16:37.326 --> 16:39.059
He was a self-made man.

16:39.061 --> 16:41.059
He actually as a young man

16:41.361 --> 16:43.627
was indentured out to a bricklayer

16:43.629 --> 16:46.061
and worked in servant conditions,

16:46.063 --> 16:49.232
worked his way up, got
out of that situation,

16:49.234 --> 16:51.101
and started making his own business

16:51.103 --> 16:54.166
and making a name for himself
and made a lot of money.

16:54.168 --> 16:57.369
He ended up being on the board of directors

16:57.371 --> 16:59.104
of several banks in town,

16:59.206 --> 17:02.637
and he really grew to be
quite an influential man.

17:02.639 --> 17:05.644
This is a picture of him
when he was in his heyday.

17:05.646 --> 17:06.779
Quite a prominent man.

17:06.781 --> 17:08.378
He's a big guy.

17:08.381 --> 17:10.513
Even though this obviously looks like

17:10.516 --> 17:12.482
he's a healthy, well-fed man,

17:12.983 --> 17:15.715
death records show when
he finally died at age 79,

17:15.718 --> 17:18.548
he actually died of marasmus,
which is malnutrition.

17:18.550 --> 17:22.519
He wasted away to nothing.

17:28.658 --> 17:33.730
This tall, scary man.

17:33.732 --> 17:35.599
I wish he would tell me more

17:35.601 --> 17:38.237
about what, like, what his deal was

17:38.239 --> 17:40.239
when he was alive and stuff.

17:40.241 --> 17:41.507
Can you describe him?

17:41.509 --> 17:44.577
He's very thin. He's very lanky.

17:44.579 --> 17:49.111
When he was alive,
like, he still was tough,

17:49.113 --> 17:51.814
like people were afraid of him anyways.

17:51.816 --> 17:56.915
You know, I don't think
he was such a great person

17:56.917 --> 17:58.719
when he was alive, you know?

17:58.721 --> 18:04.726
I think he, you know, kind
of did maybe shady things,

18:04.728 --> 18:06.397
you know, to make money, you know?

18:06.399 --> 18:09.668
He's super smart.

18:09.670 --> 18:15.274
Very smart person and knows
how to, you know, work it.

18:15.276 --> 18:20.178
When I started to get
in there to see things,

18:20.180 --> 18:25.384
he got really sad and was
kind of like vulnerable.

18:25.386 --> 18:26.486
He didn't like that.

18:26.488 --> 18:29.322
But now he's very angry.

18:30.725 --> 18:31.591
During the research,

18:31.593 --> 18:34.028
I found that B.W. was the original owner,

18:34.030 --> 18:36.699
bought the property I'm
investigating back in 1860.

18:36.701 --> 18:38.633
1860 is what we show.

18:38.635 --> 18:39.969
He bought 80 acres.

18:40.171 --> 18:42.506
We have a map here that shows his land.

18:42.508 --> 18:43.340
He had a home there.

18:43.342 --> 18:45.175
He had a rock quarry, a vineyard,

18:45.177 --> 18:46.777
and slaves quarters.

18:47.379 --> 18:49.682
Now, do you know how
many slaves he did have?

18:49.684 --> 18:52.283
Family records show that
during the civil war,

18:52.285 --> 18:53.985
he had up to 23 slaves.

18:53.987 --> 18:56.222
So it was families, you know, men, women,

18:56.224 --> 18:58.124
and, of course, their children.

18:58.126 --> 18:59.860
And, you know, if they died,

18:59.862 --> 19:01.430
they were buried on the property.

19:04.904 --> 19:08.511
The tall, scary man...

19:08.513 --> 19:15.322
he does not want me to seek these...

19:15.324 --> 19:18.526
Things out, you know? But...

19:18.528 --> 19:19.960
the children?

19:19.962 --> 19:21.029
Yeah. But then I'm like,

19:21.031 --> 19:25.829
"well, why don't you just tell
me, you know, what they are?

19:25.831 --> 19:29.365
And then we're good."

19:29.367 --> 19:32.063
The tall man doesn't
want me to know anything

19:32.065 --> 19:33.699
about the kids in the house,

19:33.701 --> 19:36.501
but I'm determined to
find out more about them.

19:36.503 --> 19:39.570
And something is telling
me to head to the basement.

19:43.274 --> 19:45.877
He definitely has a lot of control

19:45.879 --> 19:48.375
over the other dead people here.

19:48.377 --> 19:54.779
Somebody says something about bad kids...

19:54.781 --> 19:56.214
well, bad children.

19:56.216 --> 19:57.982
And then I'm hearing "headmaster."

19:58.184 --> 20:02.887
And then somebody's yelling about justice

20:02.889 --> 20:06.357
and, you know, doing what
needs to be done to them,

20:06.359 --> 20:10.093
you know, that they're like [Bleep] demons,

20:10.095 --> 20:12.598
and, you know, they
don't have souls anyways.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.035
I don't know what's going on here.

20:14.037 --> 20:16.337
This is getting [Bleep] weird, man.

20:18.374 --> 20:20.576
This is going pretty back,

20:20.578 --> 20:24.313
you know, like 1860s.

20:24.315 --> 20:27.985
I don't really want to
be down here anymore.

20:29.653 --> 20:31.253
Marcia, you mentioned on the phone

20:31.255 --> 20:33.355
that B.W. had some tragedy in his life.

20:33.357 --> 20:34.591
What were you talking about?

20:34.593 --> 20:37.331
A lot of people came in and out of his life

20:37.333 --> 20:38.898
and died sad deaths.

20:39.100 --> 20:42.068
He lost his first wife at a very young age.

20:42.070 --> 20:43.271
She was only 22.

20:43.273 --> 20:45.940
Out of his 13 children
that were born to him,

20:45.942 --> 20:48.140
only 6 of them lived to adulthood.

20:48.142 --> 20:51.112
Several of them died as young children.

20:51.114 --> 20:53.516
As a matter of fact, one year,

20:53.518 --> 20:56.920
he lost three children
within a week of each other.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.087
And do we know what they died of?

20:58.389 --> 20:59.657
Probably Scarlet fever.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.460
I don't know if I would have been
able to handle something like that.

21:01.462 --> 21:02.927
I can't imagine.

21:06.631 --> 21:10.601
This tall, scary man...

21:10.603 --> 21:14.905
I want to say that he lost a child.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.038
I think he lost a son.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.776
He believes in heaven and hell and God,

21:19.778 --> 21:21.879
but he denounces them.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.849
He is very confusing.

21:24.851 --> 21:29.453
He might have been summoned to
do some kind of messed up stuff,

21:29.455 --> 21:32.091
'cause he's doing some pretty bad [Bleep]

21:47.362 --> 21:50.766
There's so much death associated
with my client's property,

21:50.768 --> 21:53.702
but I still need to know
if there's anything else.

21:53.704 --> 21:56.472
So I'm hitting the books
at the local library.

21:58.607 --> 21:59.875
Digging through old records,

21:59.877 --> 22:03.681
I uncover a murder/suicide
that happened in 1894,

22:04.283 --> 22:08.051
right across the street
from my client's house.

22:08.153 --> 22:09.051
I'm heading over to meet

22:09.053 --> 22:10.786
with the city's chief medical examiner

22:10.988 --> 22:12.786
so he can help me make sense of it all.

22:21.659 --> 22:22.759
Well, Dr. Graham, thanks for meeting me.

22:22.761 --> 22:23.960
I know you're a busy man.

22:24.662 --> 22:26.760
Now, what can you tell me
about this murder/suicide

22:26.762 --> 22:28.227
that happened across the street

22:28.229 --> 22:29.895
from the property I'm investigating?

22:29.897 --> 22:32.930
Basically, there was
a new house being built

22:32.932 --> 22:35.265
for a construction boss
or a carpenter boss.

22:35.367 --> 22:36.465
Okay.

22:36.467 --> 22:40.203
And he had fired one of his
workers a few days earlier,

22:40.205 --> 22:42.769
probably because of the
worker being a drinker.

22:42.771 --> 22:44.403
- That was a Mr. Stute.
- Okay.

22:45.005 --> 22:47.676
And so Mr. Stute thought
about it for a while

22:47.678 --> 22:49.279
and really got agitated,

22:49.281 --> 22:51.849
brought his double-barreled
shotgun to the work site.

22:51.851 --> 22:53.350
One of the following mornings,

22:53.352 --> 22:55.449
Mr. Wench, who was the carpenter boss,

22:55.651 --> 22:57.948
was on the second story
of this unfinished house.

22:58.050 --> 22:59.281
Okay.

22:59.283 --> 23:02.885
Mr. Stute came in and discharged one barrel

23:03.387 --> 23:06.054
of the double-barreled shotgun

23:06.056 --> 23:09.489
and looks like hit Mr.
Wench in the jaw area,

23:09.491 --> 23:11.089
and then up and out through the face.

23:11.091 --> 23:12.957
And, in fact, I've got a
copy of the newspaper article

23:12.959 --> 23:15.057
and one of the artist's renditions.

23:15.259 --> 23:16.857
Oh. Look at that.

23:16.859 --> 23:20.059
And then as soon as he did that,

23:20.061 --> 23:24.528
Mr. Stute put the stock
of the gun on the floor,

23:24.530 --> 23:27.297
leaned over it with the
muzzle against his belly,

23:27.299 --> 23:31.302
and discharged the second
barrel and took his own life.

23:31.304 --> 23:32.669
Wow.

23:32.671 --> 23:34.839
And I was able to locate the
original coroner's inquest

23:34.841 --> 23:35.874
for each of those deaths.

23:35.876 --> 23:36.876
You're kidding me.

23:36.878 --> 23:38.377
This is the original paperwork?

23:38.379 --> 23:40.746
This is the original paperwork from 1894.

23:44.947 --> 23:46.312
And as it turns out,

23:46.314 --> 23:48.579
Mr. stute did not die right away,

23:48.581 --> 23:51.181
but was taken to the old city hospital,

23:51.183 --> 23:54.983
where he was operated on
and died within a few hours.

23:57.218 --> 24:00.290
I would say that this is a busy area,

24:00.292 --> 24:03.624
and so I don't know

24:03.626 --> 24:09.627
if what I'm getting is site-specific,

24:09.629 --> 24:15.361
but I did have this pain
in my back right here,

24:15.363 --> 24:18.265
and it goes all the way through.

24:18.267 --> 24:21.064
Extremely painful.

24:21.066 --> 24:25.468
So I think that someone maybe got shot.

24:25.470 --> 24:28.901
I don't know front or back.

24:28.903 --> 24:33.474
I think that it was a male.

24:33.476 --> 24:34.909
And the problem is

24:34.911 --> 24:39.209
I don't know if it was murder or suicide.

24:50.243 --> 24:52.811
During my walk, I saw a tall, thin man

24:52.813 --> 24:55.315
who was able to cause hallucinations.

24:55.317 --> 24:57.251
I'm meeting with a sketch artist

24:57.253 --> 24:59.251
to describe how he appeared to me.

24:59.253 --> 25:02.253
He was approximately 6'4",

25:02.255 --> 25:05.488
extremely thin, especially for his height.

25:05.490 --> 25:07.557
His hair goes back.

25:07.559 --> 25:09.861
Very dark eyes.

25:09.863 --> 25:12.362
Next, I described the childlike entities

25:12.364 --> 25:14.929
who are plotting to harm a living person.

25:14.931 --> 25:17.625
So it happened at the top of the stairwell.

25:17.627 --> 25:19.060
They were all together.

25:19.062 --> 25:20.861
There was about three of them,

25:20.863 --> 25:25.526
and they had decided
to do this to this lady.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.166
Is this what you saw?

25:33.967 --> 25:35.701
Yes.

26:00.379 --> 26:03.511
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

26:03.513 --> 26:05.411
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

26:05.413 --> 26:07.478
and our clients for the first time.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.445
Well, Amy, I'd like you
to meet Shanan and Krystal.

26:10.447 --> 26:11.814
Now, they're sisters.

26:11.816 --> 26:15.286
Krystal actually owns this home,

26:15.288 --> 26:17.923
and Shanan was living
here with her four kids.

26:17.925 --> 26:19.324
I actually have a photo.

26:23.565 --> 26:25.033
Aw.

26:25.035 --> 26:28.702
Well, thing is, activity got
so bad here a few months back,

26:28.704 --> 26:31.707
she packed up herself and
the four kids and got out.

26:31.709 --> 26:34.578
Problem we got here is that
Krystal is still in the house,

26:34.580 --> 26:35.713
and she's here alone.

26:38.784 --> 26:40.051
Shanan called us in

26:40.053 --> 26:43.087
'cause she's afraid that
her sister may be in danger.

26:43.089 --> 26:44.622
So with that, I'm gonna ask Amy

26:44.624 --> 26:46.492
to tell us a little bit about her walk.

26:48.762 --> 26:54.362
So, when I was first upstairs,
I met an elderly gentleman,

26:54.364 --> 26:58.097
and he feels very lonely and very sad.

26:58.099 --> 27:02.434
And basically, he's a little scattered,

27:02.436 --> 27:07.306
but what he does mostly
is he'll wander around,

27:07.308 --> 27:09.408
and then he'll, like, settle in a room.

27:09.410 --> 27:12.640
So if you go into that
room and he's in there,

27:12.642 --> 27:14.609
you'll feel sick,

27:14.611 --> 27:18.948
you'll feel depressed, you'll feel lonely.

27:21.017 --> 27:22.084
Yeah, my moods change.

27:22.086 --> 27:25.089
I feel sadness for no reason.

27:25.091 --> 27:26.758
I get angry for no reason.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.429
There are days when I go to work,

27:30.431 --> 27:34.569
and I would just have,
like, the worst attitude.

27:34.571 --> 27:36.906
But then, after I'm there for a while,

27:36.908 --> 27:37.939
then it goes away.

27:37.941 --> 27:42.212
Since I have been here,
I've totally changed.

27:42.214 --> 27:46.886
I can be very mean sometimes,
and that's not my character.

27:48.022 --> 27:50.892
Okay.

27:50.894 --> 27:53.595
There was another person who,

27:53.597 --> 27:55.897
as soon as I was heading up the stairs,

27:55.899 --> 27:57.633
he told me to get the "F" out.

27:57.635 --> 28:00.770
He was very secretive.

28:00.772 --> 28:05.446
He's very capable of
interaction on a physical level.

28:05.448 --> 28:09.187
People definitely see this guy.

28:09.189 --> 28:16.293
I saw this person push
himself out of his skin,

28:16.295 --> 28:21.299
and then he was just like
a skeleton with muscle.

28:21.301 --> 28:26.144
And I saw him standing by
the side of a child's bed.

28:26.146 --> 28:29.147
That's my son.

28:29.149 --> 28:32.983
He told me somebody sits by his bed.

28:32.985 --> 28:36.385
Did you believe him when he told you?

28:36.387 --> 28:40.256
No. I didn't.

28:42.026 --> 28:43.227
Need a minute?

28:43.229 --> 28:45.360
I'm fine.

28:46.997 --> 28:49.099
This man's very intelligent,

28:49.101 --> 28:52.466
very manipulative, very cunning.

28:52.468 --> 28:55.503
He can cause the living
to have hallucinations.

28:55.505 --> 28:57.806
He's so good at this

28:57.808 --> 29:02.442
that there was a lot of
confusion on this walk for me,

29:02.444 --> 29:04.680
because I didn't know what was the truth.

29:04.682 --> 29:07.915
Was he making me hallucinate?

29:07.917 --> 29:10.487
These girls talk about
hallucinations, both of them.

29:10.489 --> 29:12.755
Mm-hmm.

29:12.757 --> 29:15.993
Can you tell Amy about that incident

29:15.995 --> 29:17.364
down here on the couch?

29:20.300 --> 29:25.706
These three images just came
to me, one after another.

29:25.708 --> 29:28.842
The first image is
being the gladiator type.

29:28.844 --> 29:30.576
Mm-hmm.

29:30.578 --> 29:32.944
The second was like an American Indian.

29:32.946 --> 29:37.083
And then the third one, it
was just a white something.

29:37.085 --> 29:38.353
I couldn't tell,

29:38.355 --> 29:41.723
but I was the most
threatened by the last one,

29:41.725 --> 29:43.824
and it terrified me so bad.

29:43.826 --> 29:45.692
You had mentioned to me

29:45.694 --> 29:48.429
you get those images when
your eyes are shut, right?

29:48.431 --> 29:52.566
Yeah. They're like ungodly creatures.

29:52.568 --> 29:55.268
They scare me so bad.

29:55.270 --> 29:57.203
Now, you mentioned this
guy can be physical, right?

29:57.205 --> 29:57.906
Yes.

29:58.408 --> 30:01.373
They got something really
strange going on in this house.

30:01.475 --> 30:05.143
They have coins getting
thrown at them out of nowhere.

30:05.145 --> 30:05.977
I've seen it.

30:05.979 --> 30:08.613
Everyone is in this area.

30:08.615 --> 30:11.517
Everyone is sitting
around, watching television.

30:11.519 --> 30:12.986
No one's moving.

30:12.988 --> 30:14.722
Next thing you know,

30:14.724 --> 30:18.358
my son is, like, saying "ow,"

30:18.360 --> 30:22.395
and then a coin drops to the floor.

30:22.397 --> 30:25.932
They're in physical sight of me.

30:25.934 --> 30:28.499
I know that neither one
of them could do this.

30:31.234 --> 30:32.669
And the reason you left here

30:32.671 --> 30:34.706
is because your daughter
got hit with a brush.

30:34.708 --> 30:36.306
Yes.

30:36.308 --> 30:38.074
Down here, in the back.

30:38.076 --> 30:39.242
And they don't keep any brushes down here.

30:39.244 --> 30:41.980
Mm-hmm. Okay.

30:41.982 --> 30:44.150
Is he capable of doing anything like that?

30:44.152 --> 30:47.021
Yeah. He's able to do that.

30:48.391 --> 30:52.064
Now, did you get any sense of
who this guy might have been

30:52.066 --> 30:53.329
when he was alive?

30:53.331 --> 30:57.702
What I got was that he
was directly connected

30:57.704 --> 30:59.502
to this property.

30:59.504 --> 31:01.638
He was, like, showing himself

31:01.640 --> 31:04.445
to be, like, extremely tall, very thin.

31:04.447 --> 31:06.777
You could really see his bones.

31:06.779 --> 31:09.616
I got that he was a very intimidating guy.

31:09.618 --> 31:12.952
I think it was because he
was really, really smart,

31:12.954 --> 31:15.685
very commanding, and people
were very afraid of him.

31:15.687 --> 31:21.058
But he's actually very sad,
and after quite some time,

31:21.060 --> 31:24.827
I got that he did lose a
child and that it was a son.

31:24.829 --> 31:28.095
After some time of being very sad,

31:28.097 --> 31:32.370
became very angry, he denounced God.

31:33.904 --> 31:36.570
Now, back in 1860,

31:36.572 --> 31:38.005
this property was acquired by a guy

31:38.007 --> 31:39.506
that I think she may be talking about,

31:39.508 --> 31:40.607
is this guy B.W. Alexander.

31:40.609 --> 31:44.009
1861, he moved his entire family here,

31:44.011 --> 31:46.177
along with his 23 slaves.

31:48.312 --> 31:50.979
Now, you said this guy was tough, smart,

31:50.981 --> 31:52.514
and intimidated people.

31:52.516 --> 31:55.249
Well, Alexander was a pretty powerful man

31:55.251 --> 31:56.750
in this neighborhood.

31:56.752 --> 31:59.853
This is a guy that went
from rags to riches.

31:59.855 --> 32:03.353
He was an indentured servant
at one point as a kid,

32:03.355 --> 32:07.150
ran away, and became a
self-made millionaire.

32:07.152 --> 32:08.820
You said he lost a son.

32:08.822 --> 32:09.389
Right.

32:09.391 --> 32:11.557
Now, this guy had 13 children altogether.

32:11.759 --> 32:15.592
Six of them died.

32:15.594 --> 32:17.559
Four of them were boys.

32:20.129 --> 32:21.628
You said he was a big guy,

32:21.630 --> 32:23.627
but then you said he was skinny.

32:23.629 --> 32:24.428
Mm-hmm.

32:24.430 --> 32:27.932
He died of a thing called
marasmus... malnutrition.

32:27.934 --> 32:29.334
Oh.

32:29.336 --> 32:31.135
He died at the age of 79.

32:31.137 --> 32:32.870
He was a big guy,

32:32.872 --> 32:35.707
but by the time he died,
he was pretty emaciated.

32:35.709 --> 32:40.012
I actually have a picture
of B.W. Alexander right here.

32:42.885 --> 32:45.454
So, I don't know if this is
the guy you might have ran into.

32:45.456 --> 32:47.888
Uh... No.

32:47.890 --> 32:52.862
But I did do a sketch of the
tall, thin man I encountered.

32:59.572 --> 33:01.273
Well, that ain't him.

33:01.275 --> 33:02.673
No.

33:11.082 --> 33:13.184
No.

33:15.256 --> 33:19.293
You think it's somebody you might know?

33:19.295 --> 33:22.493
Well, I didn't even think about
this until she said something,

33:22.495 --> 33:25.129
but my son... a long time ago,

33:25.131 --> 33:28.031
he used to tell me that
somebody used to sit by his bed.

33:28.033 --> 33:31.234
And he told me that he looked like daddy,

33:31.236 --> 33:33.535
like his father.

33:33.537 --> 33:34.970
His father is alive,

33:34.972 --> 33:37.904
and he looks something like him.

33:37.906 --> 33:41.477
So he shows himself to be something

33:41.479 --> 33:43.781
that he would be comfortable with.

33:43.783 --> 33:46.849
Actually, I think he might
be showing himself like that

33:46.851 --> 33:48.485
to warn the living here,

33:48.487 --> 33:51.522
because the other thing I got

33:51.524 --> 33:55.658
was these childlike entities,

33:55.660 --> 34:00.931
and the guy I was talking
to became very afraid.

34:00.933 --> 34:04.904
He said that these were evil things.

34:04.906 --> 34:07.741
I went looking for them,

34:07.743 --> 34:11.177
and I ended up in the basement,

34:11.179 --> 34:16.212
where I encountered this other guy.

34:16.214 --> 34:21.188
And the children called him a headmaster,

34:21.190 --> 34:26.091
and this male was definitely
abusive to these children.

34:26.092 --> 34:29.562
It made me extremely uncomfortable.

34:29.563 --> 34:32.897
I got that this was pretty
far back, like 1860s.

34:32.899 --> 34:36.804
You say "headmaster," and
then you're going back in time.

34:36.806 --> 34:38.170
There might have been slave kids

34:38.273 --> 34:39.570
and this guy was mistreating them.

34:39.572 --> 34:41.273
Instead of "headmaster," but "master."

34:41.275 --> 34:43.074
I don't know,

34:43.076 --> 34:45.438
but the living might see them

34:45.440 --> 34:47.342
kind of out of the corner of their eyes.

34:47.344 --> 34:49.744
They cause a lot of ruckus.

34:49.746 --> 34:54.112
You'll hear a lot of,
like, movement or sound.

34:54.114 --> 35:00.019
Also, they like to
orchestrate, like, catastrophes.

35:01.319 --> 35:04.222
What do you mean by that?

35:04.224 --> 35:09.092
Well, I was seeing a lot
of different scenarios

35:09.094 --> 35:12.596
that these kids were planning,

35:12.598 --> 35:17.466
and one of the things was
something that I sketched.

35:17.468 --> 35:18.434
Okay.

35:26.078 --> 35:27.812
Oh

35:34.952 --> 35:36.285
I don't know if I want to show you this.

35:41.857 --> 35:43.958
Oh...

35:47.096 --> 35:49.327
Are you kidding me right now?

36:05.294 --> 36:09.498
I was seeing a lot of different scenarios

36:09.500 --> 36:12.972
that these kids were planning,

36:12.974 --> 36:17.108
and one of the things was
something that I sketched.

36:25.156 --> 36:27.022
Oh

36:28.658 --> 36:30.593
I don't even know if I
want to show you this.

36:37.995 --> 36:39.162
Oh...

36:40.799 --> 36:44.702
Are you kidding me right now?

36:44.704 --> 36:48.874
This is what I was afraid of.

36:52.442 --> 36:54.109
I'm a pretty skeptical guy,

36:54.111 --> 36:56.881
but when Amy comes up
with things like this,

36:56.883 --> 36:58.615
there's just no explanation.

37:06.324 --> 37:12.196
That's almost exactly how I got hurt here.

37:13.531 --> 37:16.765
They already hurt you?

37:18.202 --> 37:19.936
God, stop it.

37:19.938 --> 37:25.377
I was standing on the landing
at the top of the stairs,

37:25.379 --> 37:28.415
and then I felt a push,

37:28.417 --> 37:35.492
and I fell so hard that I
tumbled, like, completely,

37:35.494 --> 37:38.264
and I hit the door with
my back and my head,

37:38.266 --> 37:39.466
and I flew forward.

37:39.468 --> 37:41.902
Ohh.

37:41.904 --> 37:44.709
I fractured my elbow.

37:44.711 --> 37:46.077
That's how hard I fell.

37:46.079 --> 37:48.313
I'm shocked that you're still here.

37:51.983 --> 37:56.188
I can tell you one thing
is that these kids...

37:56.190 --> 37:57.688
they're trying to reorganize

37:57.690 --> 38:01.889
and figure out a better way
to make you hurt yourself.

38:03.091 --> 38:06.924
They're not giving up.

38:06.926 --> 38:09.027
So...

38:15.201 --> 38:18.569
This is what I think is going on here.

38:18.571 --> 38:22.305
The male that I encountered
while he was alive

38:22.307 --> 38:25.677
probably had a fractured sense of self,

38:25.679 --> 38:29.983
possibly having multiple personalities,

38:29.985 --> 38:35.892
and when he died, they kind of separated,

38:35.894 --> 38:39.398
creating many different entities.

38:39.400 --> 38:42.137
So, if I'm reading you right,

38:42.139 --> 38:45.976
is the headmaster and the tall
guy the same person but split?

38:46.078 --> 38:48.146
I think so, yes. I do.

38:48.148 --> 38:50.482
I think it's two aspects of this guy.

38:53.320 --> 38:57.491
Even the elderly man
could also be part of him.

38:57.493 --> 39:02.130
The thing is, is he'll do
anything to make you leave,

39:02.132 --> 39:04.396
even if it is horrifying.

39:04.398 --> 39:10.734
But what he was telling me was
that he was doing these things

39:10.736 --> 39:13.469
to protect the families here...

39:13.471 --> 39:15.205
What?

39:15.507 --> 39:19.076
Because he knew that these children

39:19.078 --> 39:24.516
are here who mean big, big harm.

39:27.355 --> 39:33.094
So, for him to appear as
your son's father makes sense,

39:33.096 --> 39:39.867
because he's trying in his
warped way to be the protector.

39:39.869 --> 39:44.173
But, you know, there
being living children here

39:44.175 --> 39:48.341
is not an option right
now, as you are aware.

39:50.709 --> 39:54.709
It's not a good place for
living people in general,

39:54.711 --> 39:56.544
but very much children.

40:06.221 --> 40:09.088
Well, Shanan, it's very good

40:09.090 --> 40:10.755
that you moved the kids out of here,

40:10.757 --> 40:14.925
and it's even better that
you called us in, all right?

40:14.927 --> 40:16.827
You weren't over-reacting.

40:16.829 --> 40:19.660
Obviously, your sister was in danger.

40:19.662 --> 40:23.964
The big question is,
can she stay here safely?

40:26.869 --> 40:29.806
For that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

40:31.276 --> 40:38.182
Initially, I was thinking
about an exorcism.

40:41.654 --> 40:43.288
But since he's trying to make up

40:43.290 --> 40:45.456
for the evil he's done in the past

40:45.458 --> 40:46.990
and protect you from these things here,

40:47.592 --> 40:49.958
I want to try something else first.

40:49.960 --> 40:54.265
So you need to bring in a chaos magician.

40:54.267 --> 40:58.067
A chaos magician uses anything
from religion, science,

40:58.069 --> 41:01.737
to cultural traditions to
clear an area of the dead.

41:01.739 --> 41:03.271
There's no set formula,

41:03.273 --> 41:05.239
as they work on a
case-by-case basis,

41:05.241 --> 41:06.406
but when they're done,

41:06.408 --> 41:09.175
Krystal's home should be free of the dead.

41:09.977 --> 41:12.144
So, everything would be cleared out, then?

41:12.146 --> 41:13.312
Yes.

41:13.614 --> 41:14.979
Including the kids?

41:14.981 --> 41:16.845
Yeah.

41:17.347 --> 41:22.416
But I do have a concern for
you being here in the meantime,

41:22.418 --> 41:27.586
because they're going to
feel extremely threatened

41:27.588 --> 41:31.188
and very unhappy.

41:31.190 --> 41:32.889
So basically you're telling us

41:32.891 --> 41:36.226
she should go stay someplace
else till she gets this guy in.

41:36.228 --> 41:38.526
I think you should, yes.

41:38.528 --> 41:43.095
Would you be able to swing that?

41:43.097 --> 41:44.730
Definitely.

41:44.732 --> 41:46.264
You don't have to worry about that.

41:46.266 --> 41:50.170
I just wish I could get
it started, like, tonight.

41:50.172 --> 41:52.940
I will call him.

41:55.912 --> 41:58.114
I'm concerned for Krystal,

41:58.116 --> 41:59.948
as the entities within this house

41:59.950 --> 42:02.916
pose a very real physical danger.

42:02.918 --> 42:05.389
But I believe that if
she follows my advice,

42:05.391 --> 42:06.457
she'll remain safe

42:06.459 --> 42:08.426
and be able to lead a peaceful life

42:08.428 --> 42:10.363
in the home she loves so much.
