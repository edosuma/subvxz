00:12.957 --> 00:13.977
Hey.

00:13.988 --> 00:15.607
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

00:15.608 --> 00:17.469
H...

00:17.470 --> 00:20.504
Were you... Were you watching me sleep?

00:20.505 --> 00:22.883
No, I was watching you try to breathe.

00:22.884 --> 00:25.676
I think you have
a... a badly deviated septum.

00:25.677 --> 00:28.055
But it's a damn cute deviated septum.

00:28.056 --> 00:29.814
Aw, thank you.

00:29.815 --> 00:31.469
I got you something.

00:31.470 --> 00:33.538
Okay.

00:33.539 --> 00:36.055
What is it?

00:36.056 --> 00:37.814
Open it.

00:37.815 --> 00:40.469
Wow.

00:40.470 --> 00:42.849
Ah, it's a... it's a little yellow hat.

00:42.850 --> 00:44.469
Try it on.

00:44.470 --> 00:47.642
Oh, I-I'd love to try it on.

00:50.712 --> 00:53.021
I love this.

00:53.022 --> 00:54.302
Really?

00:54.313 --> 00:56.642
Yes. Perfect.

00:56.643 --> 00:59.366
I mean, do you think it fits?

00:59.367 --> 01:00.607
Definitely. Does it feel loose?

01:00.608 --> 01:01.918
I don't know what it is.

01:01.919 --> 01:03.573
Well, you can always put a bobby pin in

01:03.574 --> 01:06.883
to keep it in place,
like they do with the, um...

01:06.884 --> 01:08.435
Yarmulkes? Yes.

01:08.436 --> 01:10.262
Wait.

01:10.263 --> 01:11.918
Why do you know that word?

01:11.919 --> 01:13.435
I'm... I'm Jewish.

01:16.022 --> 01:17.573
Okay.

01:17.574 --> 01:20.055
No. I'm... I'm 100% Jewish.

01:20.056 --> 01:21.918
Well, you are funny.

01:21.919 --> 01:23.780

Mommy!

01:34.367 --> 01:36.297
My Genes&Me results came!

01:36.298 --> 01:38.228
Okay, I am...

01:38.229 --> 01:40.780
100% Ashkenazi Jew.

01:40.781 --> 01:42.466
Yeah, no shit. Ever seen a mirror?

01:42.477 --> 01:45.814
Wow. Okay. We have history of anxiety.

01:45.815 --> 01:47.573
Check. Poor eyesight.

01:47.574 --> 01:49.469
Check.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.262
Yeah, well... Tay-Sachs disease.

01:51.263 --> 01:53.140
- Cystic fibrosis. Fragile X syndrome.
- Uh-huh.

01:53.151 --> 01:55.124
Holy shit. Let me tell
you something, honey.

01:55.125 --> 01:57.676
I could've told you all of that
without your selling

01:57.677 --> 01:59.538
your medical history to the government.

01:59.539 --> 02:01.814
What... What do you mean?

02:01.815 --> 02:05.504
Google owns your DNA,
you naive little bitch!

02:07.470 --> 02:09.780
Well, I'm gonna write all about this

02:09.781 --> 02:11.297
for my grad school personal essay.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.538
"Endophenotypes: The Genetic Inheritance

02:13.539 --> 02:15.676
- "of Mental Disorders."
- Yikes!

02:15.677 --> 02:19.331
Okay, what else does this have
to teach me abo...

02:21.125 --> 02:22.331
Oh, my God.

02:22.332 --> 02:24.814
Oh, my God!!

02:24.815 --> 02:26.574
- Abbi.
- What?

02:26.575 --> 02:28.366
Well, I just found out

02:28.367 --> 02:30.873
that I have the richest history
a millennial Jew can have.

02:30.884 --> 02:34.573
I'm related...
â™ª to a Holocaust survivor â™ª

02:34.574 --> 02:36.124
Yah!

02:43.263 --> 02:44.504
Hey!

02:44.505 --> 02:45.849
Dude, this is incredible.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.538
There's so few left.
There's, like, none.

02:47.539 --> 02:49.021
I know, and I'm 16th cousins

02:49.022 --> 02:51.849
- with one who lives in Manhattan!
- Whoa.

02:51.850 --> 02:53.883
- We have to go right the fuck now.
- Okay.

02:53.884 --> 02:55.366
Dope, because I know that I can learn

02:55.367 --> 02:56.849
so much about my history or whatever,

02:56.850 --> 02:59.366
but also about our shared
mental illness. Shwing!

02:59.367 --> 03:01.193
Maybe I should get my DNA tested.

03:01.194 --> 03:03.504
I could be related to a
Holocaust survivor, too.

03:03.505 --> 03:04.711
Who, a guard?

03:04.712 --> 03:06.228
Come on, Ilana.

03:06.229 --> 03:07.656
I don't mean a full-on Nazi.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.853
I mean like a Polish soldier
who looked the other way.

03:09.864 --> 03:11.504
I am Jewish.

03:11.505 --> 03:13.987
Yeah, emphasis on the "ish."
Come on. Let's go.

03:13.988 --> 03:16.159
So what are we doing, the Q or the F?

03:16.160 --> 03:17.573
Fuck!

03:17.574 --> 03:18.987
What da hat?

03:18.988 --> 03:20.538
Oh, this? Lesley got it for me.

03:20.539 --> 03:22.504
She saw it and thought of me.

03:22.505 --> 03:24.745
It's cute, right? I'm
just giving it a go.

03:24.746 --> 03:25.883
We'll see.

03:25.894 --> 03:28.055
Brave.

03:34.850 --> 03:38.400
Yeah, so she was just, like, out
and saw it in a store

03:38.401 --> 03:40.849
and... and thought of me.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.538
And...

03:42.539 --> 03:44.262
we think she likes you, right?

03:44.263 --> 03:46.159
Yeah. Yeah, I mean...

03:46.160 --> 03:48.262
I think she really likes me.

03:48.263 --> 03:50.883
I'm... I... I really like her, too.

03:52.212 --> 03:53.918
So, you're a hat girl now?

03:53.919 --> 03:56.159
I mean... I mean, maybe.

03:56.160 --> 03:59.400
Is that, um... a problem?

03:59.401 --> 04:02.642
I'm just... I'm surprised.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.711
You know, you've...
you've never expressed

04:04.712 --> 04:06.090
any interest in hats.

04:06.091 --> 04:08.159
I watch your eyes when we walk,
when we talk.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.331
You've never even looked at a hat.

04:10.332 --> 04:13.814
Well, I mean, I guess I never
really considered them.

04:13.815 --> 04:16.192
Right. But Lesley bought it for me,

04:16.194 --> 04:18.607
- so I'm I'm gonna give it a try.
- One last thing...

04:18.608 --> 04:21.538
Do you think you're gonna be a hat
person for the rest of your life?

04:21.539 --> 04:23.849
I don't know.

04:23.850 --> 04:25.676
Are we talking about hats?

04:25.677 --> 04:28.401
Yeah. We're talking about hats.

04:31.224 --> 04:32.952
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:32.953 --> 04:35.435
We are here to visit
my very dear, sweet,

04:35.436 --> 04:39.055
and close 16th cousin Saul Borowitz.

04:39.056 --> 04:42.297
Oh, fantastic. He'll be so
happy to have visitors.

04:42.298 --> 04:43.952
Can I have your licenses?

04:43.953 --> 04:46.469
And you'll get your licenses
back when you leave.

04:46.470 --> 04:47.745
Great.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.573
You can take him to the commissary,

04:49.584 --> 04:52.673
or any of the communal areas
on the third floor.

04:52.684 --> 04:54.676
- Thank you.
- He's in Room 11B.

04:54.677 --> 04:56.124
- Thank you.
- Thanks so much.

04:56.125 --> 04:58.780
- Do not leave the third floor.
- Okay.

05:00.815 --> 05:02.298
Dope.

05:10.539 --> 05:12.331
Maybe he's hard of hearing.

05:16.643 --> 05:18.469
Should we just try to go in?

05:18.470 --> 05:20.229
Let me try something first.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.642
Looks like I'm the magician

05:25.643 --> 05:27.883
even though you're the one
wearing that hat.

05:27.884 --> 05:31.055
Okay, I think the door
was just unlocked.

05:34.802 --> 05:36.952
Saul? Saul Borowitz?

05:36.953 --> 05:38.849
I'm your 16th cousin Ilana Wexler.

05:38.850 --> 05:40.849
Oh, my God.

05:40.850 --> 05:42.435
Oh, my God.

05:42.436 --> 05:43.883
No!

05:43.884 --> 05:45.469
No, no, no, no.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.814
No. Oh, God.

05:47.815 --> 05:51.676
I knew I shouldn't have stopped
at Sephora before I came here!

05:51.677 --> 05:54.849
I'm gonna cover his face up.
This is too weird.

05:54.850 --> 05:57.297
- Gotcha!
- Oh, my God.

05:57.298 --> 05:59.869
Works every time.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.834
You know, you must be
one of those Genes&Me kids.

06:01.845 --> 06:03.883
I can see the resemblance. Look.

06:03.884 --> 06:06.124
That's me as a horny teenager.

06:06.125 --> 06:07.607
See the hair?

06:07.608 --> 06:09.021
I guess.

06:09.022 --> 06:10.573
Have a seat.

06:10.574 --> 06:12.849
- Wow.
- Great fun, huh?

06:12.850 --> 06:15.021
Yes. Wild. Wild.

06:15.022 --> 06:16.883
Very scary.

06:16.884 --> 06:18.193
So, like I said, I'm Ilana.

06:18.194 --> 06:20.124
And this is my, um...

06:20.125 --> 06:21.918
Oh, God. She's my everything.

06:21.919 --> 06:23.618
But, you know what, I'll just
boil it down to soulmate.

06:23.629 --> 06:25.141
Let's... Let's just
leave it at soulmate.

06:25.152 --> 06:26.229
I'm Abbi.

06:26.240 --> 06:27.435
Nice to meet you both.

06:27.436 --> 06:29.538
So, Saul, I'm applying
to graduate school,

06:29.539 --> 06:32.538
and I'm writing my personal essay
about inherited trauma.

06:33.953 --> 06:36.400
For example, I experience
anxiety diarrhea

06:36.401 --> 06:39.297
- three to eight times daily.
- Ay, yi, yi, yi.

06:39.298 --> 06:42.607
Now, do you think
that somatic expression

06:42.608 --> 06:45.849
tracks back to your horrific experience

06:45.850 --> 06:47.400
somehow, for sure?

06:47.401 --> 06:50.055
No.

06:50.056 --> 06:53.952
I'm gonna write "possible connection."

06:53.953 --> 06:55.814
Okay. So, tell me everything.

06:55.815 --> 06:57.883
I want to hear
about mental illness history,

06:57.884 --> 07:00.331
stories from the old country,
Nazi shit, anything.

07:00.332 --> 07:02.814
Tell you what.

07:02.815 --> 07:06.297
I'll tell you everything... the whole
family, relatives, everything...

07:06.298 --> 07:08.538
if you'll take me out of here
for a little while.

07:08.539 --> 07:11.435
I've been cooped up here
so long, and you know what?

07:11.436 --> 07:13.321
The food here is horse shit.

07:13.332 --> 07:15.307
Well, the woman downstairs
said we could take you

07:15.318 --> 07:16.607
wherever you want on this floor.

07:16.608 --> 07:18.814
Ah, come on. It's so strict down there.

07:18.815 --> 07:22.736
I-I'm sorry, Saul. We can't. I
mean, we're just following orders.

07:23.815 --> 07:25.573
Well, I've heard that one before.

07:25.574 --> 07:27.297
Oooooooh!

07:27.298 --> 07:29.435
Okay, okay. We're getting you
out of here right now!

07:29.436 --> 07:31.193
Wow!

07:32.677 --> 07:35.607
Yes! Yes.

07:35.608 --> 07:37.366
Oh, uh... this guy had an accident.

07:37.367 --> 07:39.366
Shit was everywhere.
We gotta get rid of the rug.

07:39.367 --> 07:41.159
Yep. We're doing it.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.574
Getting him out!

07:43.609 --> 07:46.557
Oh, man.

07:46.568 --> 07:48.533
Okay. I got... I can't do this anymore.

07:48.534 --> 07:50.847
- Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Ready?
- Alright. Okay.

07:50.858 --> 07:52.119
- Shit! Shit!
- God...

07:52.120 --> 07:53.498
Saul! Saul! Are you okay?!

07:53.499 --> 07:55.119
Great work, girls.

07:56.706 --> 07:58.464
Smell that New York air.

07:58.465 --> 08:00.222
It's like garbage. I love it!

08:00.223 --> 08:03.429
Oh, come on.

08:03.430 --> 08:06.464
So let's get you some real food and
get into some real family history.

08:06.465 --> 08:07.878
For example, I want to know...

08:07.879 --> 08:10.016
were your parents
mentally ill, like mine?

08:10.017 --> 08:11.705
Listen... Before we get to that...

08:11.706 --> 08:13.567
Could you guys take me to a shoemaker?

08:13.568 --> 08:15.774
- Of course, Saul.
- Good.

08:15.775 --> 08:18.429
We'll do you one better.

08:23.844 --> 08:25.311
Ooh! That looks so nice.

08:25.322 --> 08:27.291
Good.

08:27.292 --> 08:29.912
Okay, Saul, now that
I've got you in pleasure,

08:29.913 --> 08:33.360
interview question number one...
what does post-traumatic

08:33.361 --> 08:35.256
stress disorder mean to you?

08:35.258 --> 08:38.635
Look, they have high tops.
I'll be right back.

08:38.636 --> 08:41.602
He is too cute.

08:41.602 --> 08:42.912
You hear him...

08:42.913 --> 08:44.810
What?

08:44.821 --> 08:46.388
I'm just sending a selfie to Leslie.

08:46.399 --> 08:49.947
Cute. I just, um...

08:49.958 --> 08:53.785
I forgot about, uh... you know, uh...

08:56.356 --> 08:57.528
Girls!

08:57.529 --> 09:00.390
I found it... a dope-ass pair.

09:02.839 --> 09:04.528
I love these shoes.

09:04.529 --> 09:06.390
- I love them, too.
- They look amazing on you.

09:06.401 --> 09:10.148
- You hungry? Where do you want to eat?
- What about Red Hook?

09:10.149 --> 09:11.813
Red Hook is kind of hard
to get to, right?

09:11.824 --> 09:13.805
- Well, we can always take the...
- Shut up, Saul!

09:16.011 --> 09:18.148
â™ª Hello â™ª

09:18.149 --> 09:19.355
What, dude?

09:21.460 --> 09:23.493
Alan motherfucking Cumming.

09:23.494 --> 09:25.459
Oh, my God.

09:25.460 --> 09:26.804
Who is that?

09:26.805 --> 09:28.804
- Alan Cumming!
- Saul!

09:28.805 --> 09:30.666
Alan Cumming... the magical, pansexual,

09:30.667 --> 09:32.148
New York City party boi-nymph

09:32.149 --> 09:33.873
- in the beautiful flesh!
- I have chills.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.804
Okay, should we follow him?

09:35.805 --> 09:37.321
I mean, I think we have to.

09:37.322 --> 09:38.976
What? I'm starving!

09:38.977 --> 09:40.838
Okay, it is not about you
right now, honey.

09:40.839 --> 09:42.838
Saul, we're talking about Alan Cumming

09:42.839 --> 09:44.390
from... from "Romy and Michelle,"

09:44.401 --> 09:46.134
from "The Anniversary Party,"
from "The Good Wife,"

09:46.145 --> 09:48.700
from "Spice World" fame, Saul.

09:48.701 --> 09:51.557
I mean, Alan Cumming created his
own perfume line called "Cumming."

09:51.568 --> 09:53.666
Is that LOL genie or what?

09:53.667 --> 09:55.183
I'm wearing it right now.

09:55.184 --> 09:58.010
Saul, I swear to Adonai,

09:58.011 --> 10:00.010
whatever Alan Cumming has
in store for today,

10:00.011 --> 10:01.504
- you will be titillated by it.
- Yes.

10:01.515 --> 10:03.286
He represents the real New York, okay?

10:03.287 --> 10:05.700
The... The pre-9/11,
pre- "Sex in the City,"

10:05.701 --> 10:08.045
Basquiat, Keith Haring New York.

10:08.046 --> 10:10.355
The only Haring I'm interested
in is pickled herring.

10:10.356 --> 10:12.252
And as soon as we can
get to that, I am fine.

10:12.253 --> 10:14.217
You got yourself a deal.
Got yourself a deal.

10:14.218 --> 10:16.010
- We'll make it happen.
- All right!

10:16.011 --> 10:18.023
Come on, Saul.
We gotta catch up with him. Hurry it up.

10:20.219 --> 10:22.066
- Alright.
- Alright. We're gonna catch up.

10:22.077 --> 10:23.915
Giddy-up, Saul! Come on!
We got it, Saul.

10:23.926 --> 10:25.206
- Shit, shit!
- Here we go.

10:25.217 --> 10:27.010
- We're losing him.
- Okay. Alright.

10:27.011 --> 10:28.355
We got...

10:28.356 --> 10:29.976
Drag brunch! Drag brunch!

10:29.977 --> 10:31.390
- We must! We must!
- We must?

10:31.391 --> 10:32.631
We must! We must!

10:32.632 --> 10:33.838
Okay.

10:33.839 --> 10:35.528
- Come on, brother!
- Here we go.

10:35.529 --> 10:37.528
â™ª You're our guest â™ª

10:37.529 --> 10:38.942
â™ª You're our guest â™ª

10:38.943 --> 10:41.528
â™ª Jiggly Caliente is the best â™ª

10:41.529 --> 10:43.907
â™ª Tuck your dick between your legs â™ª

10:43.908 --> 10:46.735
â™ª And shake those unfeasibly
large breasts â™ª

10:46.736 --> 10:49.390
â™ª A generous pour, contours and curves â™ª

10:49.391 --> 10:52.045
â™ª All the drinks that you deserve â™ª

10:52.046 --> 10:54.528
â™ª We are dressed in all couture â™ª

10:54.529 --> 10:57.252
â™ª Just ask our queen, Sasha Velour â™ª

10:57.253 --> 11:00.079
â™ª Undo your belt, loosen your pants â™ª

11:00.080 --> 11:02.873
â™ª Tip your waitress, she's freelance â™ª

11:02.874 --> 11:08.631
â™ª Our mimosa pours will
always past the test â™ª

11:08.632 --> 11:11.528
â™ª Come on and bring your nephew â™ª

11:11.529 --> 11:14.666
â™ª Apply your blush
and then you'll pass the test â™ª

11:14.667 --> 11:16.079
â™ª Touch my chest â™ª

11:16.080 --> 11:19.217
â™ª You're our guest â™ª

11:22.115 --> 11:23.942
Yes!

11:23.943 --> 11:25.390
Can I take your order, baby?

11:25.391 --> 11:28.217
Yes. Can I get a coffee
with a side of you?

11:28.218 --> 11:29.562
- Wooo!
- Oh!

11:29.563 --> 11:30.976
Sau-ul.

11:30.977 --> 11:33.217
Looks like I got a fresh one, mm-hmm?

11:33.218 --> 11:35.045
- I love this place.
- Thank you.

11:35.046 --> 11:37.942
And I love money,
so make sure y'all tip, okay?

11:37.943 --> 11:39.183
- Yes.
- I'll be back, doll.

11:39.184 --> 11:40.217
Okay. Love it.

11:44.805 --> 11:46.942
Oof! That was good.

11:46.943 --> 11:49.183
Oh, my God, Ilana. He's at the bar.

11:53.563 --> 11:55.666
- We have to go pay our respects.
- Okay.

11:55.667 --> 11:58.424
- Let's vape and loosen up a little bit.
- Okay. Thanks.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.804
Oh, Saul, this is a marijuana pen.

12:03.805 --> 12:06.286
Ooh, sorry.
You probably don't want that.

12:06.287 --> 12:07.700
Why shouldn't I get high?

12:10.425 --> 12:13.321
- Yeah, go for it.
- Get ripped, 'cuz.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.666
You can't get off unless you cough!

12:17.667 --> 12:20.631
That's for damn sure.

12:20.632 --> 12:23.148
Conga time!

12:23.149 --> 12:25.079
Ooh, come on, girls.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.838
Oh, my gosh, Abbi,
his friend just left him,

12:26.839 --> 12:28.285
leaving him all alone at the bar.

12:28.296 --> 12:31.010
Oh, my God. It's now or never, dude.
Come on.

12:39.494 --> 12:41.942
It's a bare... with a hint of lavender.

12:48.062 --> 12:49.387
Hello.

12:49.398 --> 12:51.252
Hi.

12:51.253 --> 12:53.700
Um, Mr. Cumming, um...

12:53.701 --> 12:58.010
we just want to say
how big of fans we are.

12:58.011 --> 13:00.010
- Um...
- Yes.

13:00.011 --> 13:02.804
Thank you so much
for bringing us here today.

13:03.677 --> 13:04.838
For bringing you?

13:04.839 --> 13:06.528
We followed you for, like, 13 blocks.

13:06.529 --> 13:07.638
Cool.

13:07.649 --> 13:09.045
- It's really cool.
- It is cool.

13:09.046 --> 13:10.735
I think it's kind of cool.

13:10.736 --> 13:12.355
So you're a couple?

13:12.356 --> 13:13.528
No.

13:13.529 --> 13:14.907
We're just best friends forever.

13:14.908 --> 13:17.321
Oh, it's just... the hat.

13:17.322 --> 13:20.217
No, we actually just brought
Ilana's 16th cousin,

13:20.218 --> 13:22.528
uh, 'cause he's a Holocaust survivor.

13:22.529 --> 13:24.252
Oh, really? That's incredible.

13:24.253 --> 13:26.631
- My cousin.
- We really need to cherish our elders

13:26.632 --> 13:28.321
and hear their stories.

13:28.322 --> 13:29.424
You want to meet him?

13:29.425 --> 13:30.942
- Sure.
- Yeah, he's here.

13:30.943 --> 13:33.252
You've got to meet
my 16th cousin, Alan Cumming.

13:33.253 --> 13:36.183
- He's great.
- He's right over there.

13:36.184 --> 13:37.602
Where is he?

13:39.322 --> 13:40.735
- Abbi, look!
- No!

13:40.736 --> 13:43.045
Saul! No!

13:46.635 --> 13:48.811
- Saul!
- Saul!

13:48.812 --> 13:50.756
Saul! Saul!

13:50.767 --> 13:52.318
Oh, my God.

13:52.329 --> 13:55.069
- He's gone for fucking ever!
- Okay, okay.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.230
Dude, we'll just see
where the bus stops next.

13:57.241 --> 13:58.617
Okay.

14:03.074 --> 14:05.356
- I can't read a fucking bus map.
- No, me either. Okay.

14:05.367 --> 14:07.038
We cannot be losing Holocaust survivors!

14:07.049 --> 14:09.428
Not now that the world
is gaining Nazis somehow!

14:09.439 --> 14:11.024
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

14:11.035 --> 14:14.214
Where would a Holocaust survivor go?
Um...

14:14.225 --> 14:15.598
Okay, okay. Think, think, think.

14:15.599 --> 14:17.736
Um, pickled herring. Um...

14:17.737 --> 14:19.322
Zabar's!

14:19.323 --> 14:20.632
Yes!

14:20.633 --> 14:21.736
Shit! My hat, dude!

14:21.737 --> 14:23.253
- Leave the hat!
- No!

14:23.254 --> 14:25.080
It's not that simple!

14:29.461 --> 14:32.529
To the mayo-based salads.

14:32.530 --> 14:35.080
Saul? Saul Borowitz?

14:35.081 --> 14:36.425
Oh, excuse me, excuse me.

14:36.426 --> 14:38.322
Have you seen an elderly gentleman,

14:38.323 --> 14:40.942
like yay high?

14:40.943 --> 14:43.667
He's also very high as in stoned.

14:43.668 --> 14:45.425
Oh, he's also wearing brightly colored

14:45.426 --> 14:47.149
- LeBron high tops.
- Yes.

14:47.150 --> 14:49.011
I don't think so. Sorry.

14:49.012 --> 14:50.250
Shit.

14:50.261 --> 14:51.725
Okay. Maybe we check down here...

14:51.736 --> 14:53.149
Wait, Ilana. Okay.

14:53.150 --> 14:56.908
Um, I'm never up here,
and... and the babka is insane.

14:56.909 --> 14:58.667
We got to get some while we're here.

14:58.668 --> 15:00.184
I will get some whitefish salad.

15:00.185 --> 15:02.046
Hey, can I get a pound
of whitefish salad please?

15:02.047 --> 15:04.205
And we'll take that to go. We're
kind of in a hurry. Thank you.

15:04.216 --> 15:06.322
Okay, dude. Where else would
a Holocaust survivor go?

15:15.219 --> 15:17.667
Wow, we really got lost in there.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.736
Well, you can't rush through.

15:19.737 --> 15:21.080
No, no.

15:21.081 --> 15:22.563
The resilience of the Jewish people

15:22.564 --> 15:24.529
- is just astounding.
- Yeah.

15:24.530 --> 15:27.468
We got to keep educating
ourselves, you know.

15:27.479 --> 15:29.701
Truly never forget. Never forget.

15:29.702 --> 15:31.322
- Shit!
- Saul!

15:31.323 --> 15:33.701
Oh, my God. Idiots!

15:33.702 --> 15:35.701
Saul?!

15:35.702 --> 15:37.253
Saul?!

15:37.254 --> 15:40.391
Okay, where else might an old Jew go?

15:40.392 --> 15:41.977
A sale.

15:41.978 --> 15:43.391
Genius. Jew magnet!

15:43.392 --> 15:44.667
Yes!

15:48.737 --> 15:50.303
Just can't pass up a sale like that.

15:50.314 --> 15:51.839
No, I mean, you find the best stuff

15:51.840 --> 15:53.391
- when you're not looking.
- That's right.

15:53.392 --> 15:54.679
I mean, we weren't trying to shop.

15:54.690 --> 15:56.268
- We had to.
- We had to.

15:56.279 --> 15:58.253
You don't find great clothes.
Great clothes find you.

15:58.254 --> 15:59.736
- Exactly.
- Damn it! Saul!

15:59.737 --> 16:01.391
Oh, my God. What is wrong with us?

16:01.392 --> 16:02.942
I don't know.
I think we smoked too much weed.

16:02.943 --> 16:04.638
We got to go back
to the assisted living facility.

16:04.649 --> 16:06.057
It's getting late, it's getting dark.

16:06.068 --> 16:07.816
Yeah, you're right.
Also we need our licenses.

16:07.827 --> 16:09.391
- Ugh. Good point.
- Geez.

16:23.032 --> 16:24.115
Hi...

16:24.116 --> 16:26.391
Doris.

16:26.392 --> 16:29.425
There's no delicate way to put this,

16:29.426 --> 16:31.273
but, um...

16:31.875 --> 16:35.080
we lost Saul, and we can't find him,

16:35.081 --> 16:36.770
and we looked all over,

16:36.771 --> 16:38.770
all the fuck over,
and we can't find him,

16:38.771 --> 16:42.667
and we're really, really, really sorry.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.736
Ooh. No disrespect.

16:45.737 --> 16:48.254
- He's at Ikea.
- What?

16:48.265 --> 16:49.563
How do you... How do you know that?

16:49.564 --> 16:52.046
When he breaks out,
he always goes to IKEA.

16:52.047 --> 16:53.356
That's what he does.

16:53.357 --> 16:54.632
That's... Well...

16:54.633 --> 16:56.287
- That's hilarious.
- Okay.

16:56.288 --> 16:58.839
Didn't I tell you not to leave
the third floor with him?

16:58.840 --> 17:01.391
- You did mention that.
- I didn't really hear it.

17:01.392 --> 17:03.667
I feel like that was
more directed to my...

17:03.668 --> 17:04.805
friend, to be honest.

17:04.806 --> 17:06.287
Okay.

17:06.288 --> 17:10.115
Um, so you guys got it from here or...

17:10.116 --> 17:14.011
And... And... And...
And we could just take...

17:14.012 --> 17:16.115
We'll just take our licenses
back real quick,

17:16.116 --> 17:18.184
and then we'll just be like,
"Great meeting ya".

17:19.494 --> 17:20.737
No.

17:23.633 --> 17:25.425
Go get him.

17:25.425 --> 17:27.115
Okay, um...

17:27.116 --> 17:29.184
Do you think that we
can leave our bags...

17:29.185 --> 17:30.218
Now.

17:30.219 --> 17:32.356
- We'll take them.
- Yeah.

17:32.357 --> 17:33.460
See you later.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.046
Saul?

17:38.527 --> 17:41.123
- Saul?!
- Oh, my God, Abbi. He's here.

17:41.134 --> 17:43.942
Oh, my gosh, Saul, we've been
looking everywhere for you!

17:43.943 --> 17:45.494
God!

17:45.495 --> 17:47.494
Wow.

17:47.495 --> 17:50.701
You know, y-you come in for
one thing, and... and...

17:50.702 --> 17:52.839
Like your cousin,
the Holocaust survivor.

17:55.012 --> 17:56.253
Before you take me back,

17:56.254 --> 17:59.460
how about some Swedish meatballs?

17:59.461 --> 18:02.460
Mm. I mean, you know I'm in.

18:02.461 --> 18:04.356
You can leave the hat in the cart.

18:14.392 --> 18:17.391
- These are so good.
- Told ya.

18:17.392 --> 18:20.356
So what's up with the IKEA fetish, Saul?

18:20.357 --> 18:22.080
Well...

18:22.081 --> 18:24.874
when I escaped from the camp,

18:24.875 --> 18:27.736
I wound up in Sweden,

18:27.737 --> 18:30.287
and those people,
the... the Swedish people,

18:30.288 --> 18:32.253
they were so good to me.

18:32.254 --> 18:35.287
And their furniture was so elegant.

18:35.288 --> 18:38.701
So this is like, um, retail therapy.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.551
Makes sense.

18:40.562 --> 18:43.136
Well, we had a great day with you.
Thanks for sharing it with us.

18:43.147 --> 18:45.011
We learned so much from you, Saul.

18:45.012 --> 18:46.908
And... And also, the, um...

18:46.909 --> 18:48.942
Holocaust Memorial Museum of New York.

18:48.943 --> 18:50.080
We just stopped by.

18:50.081 --> 18:51.391
You know my motto...

18:51.392 --> 18:53.011
Never forget.

18:53.012 --> 18:54.667
Also...

18:54.668 --> 18:56.529
- don't remind me.
- Yeah.

18:56.530 --> 19:00.011
And you look a great deal
like my father.

19:00.012 --> 19:01.701
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

19:01.702 --> 19:04.609
Really? It's all about...
It's all about the eyes...

19:04.620 --> 19:05.793
The moustache.

19:12.297 --> 19:14.572
Oh, my... God.

19:14.583 --> 19:15.911
Okay.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.990
Let me talk to you for one...
one quick sec.

19:18.001 --> 19:19.345
Okay. So, um...

19:19.407 --> 19:24.031
I, um... I feel like I gave, um,

19:24.042 --> 19:27.938
this... this guy, like,
a good go of it today.

19:27.939 --> 19:32.524
And I-I just don't think
that it's really me.

19:32.525 --> 19:34.765
O-Okay.

19:34.766 --> 19:36.972
I mean, I-I-I really
appreciate the gesture.

19:36.973 --> 19:38.593
Like, it was so nice
that you would think of me...

19:38.594 --> 19:40.351
- It's totally fine.
- But, like, it's just not my...

19:40.352 --> 19:42.560
Abbi... Abbi, listen.
I thought it looked cute on you.

19:42.571 --> 19:45.604
But you're much cuter without it.

19:49.214 --> 19:51.076
Sweet relief.

19:51.077 --> 19:53.076
Oh, my God.

19:53.077 --> 19:55.558
I feel so much better.

19:57.043 --> 19:58.704
"It's not about the hideous hat."

19:58.715 --> 20:00.783
It's about the head that wears it.

20:00.794 --> 20:02.621
I couldn't help but wonder,

20:02.632 --> 20:06.739
I used to think being Jewish
meant IBS, Tay-Sachs,

20:06.750 --> 20:11.369
"inherited trauma,
and childhood contact lenses."

20:13.490 --> 20:16.524
"But now I know being Jewish
is about being resilient,"

20:16.525 --> 20:18.593
having the strength
to survive the Holocaust

20:18.594 --> 20:21.685
in perpetual exile,
as well as being able

20:21.696 --> 20:24.413
to carry a stag table
to the parking lot of an IKEA

20:24.424 --> 20:26.027
"at 91 years old."

20:31.214 --> 20:33.593
"And I hope you have the strength"

20:33.594 --> 20:35.524
to accept this little Jew

20:35.525 --> 20:37.765
into your Psychology Gradate program.

20:37.766 --> 20:39.282
"Shalom."

20:47.052 --> 20:48.949
Yeah, I'm getting in.

Oh, my God.

20:53.594 --> 20:55.076
Cute as hell.

21:00.140 --> 21:01.381
Are you performers?

21:01.879 --> 21:02.925
No. Why?

21:02.936 --> 21:04.693
The... hat.

21:04.694 --> 21:07.693
Oh, this? No, this is a style choice.

21:07.694 --> 21:12.313
Usually, I'm pro-choice, but I
would abort this if I could.

21:12.324 --> 21:14.606
The hat... I'd burn it.
