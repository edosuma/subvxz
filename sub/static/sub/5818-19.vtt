00:13.635 --> 00:14.585

00:14.604 --> 00:16.906
I'm not okay with you choosing yourself.

00:16.907 --> 00:20.412

Great.

03:45.073 --> 03:46.506
I have an idea.

03:46.575 --> 03:49.909
No. You don't speak to me.

03:49.978 --> 03:51.044
You speak to Enzo.

03:51.112 --> 03:53.413
If you have any ideas how
to keep me from dying,

03:53.482 --> 03:55.281
I'm sure he'll be happy to hear them,

03:55.350 --> 03:57.950
but I don't want to
hear one word from your mouth

03:58.018 --> 03:59.618
directed at me. You lost the right

03:59.687 --> 04:01.186
to my attention when you decided

04:01.255 --> 04:03.155
to leave without saying good-bye.

04:04.892 --> 04:06.559
You're driving.

04:06.627 --> 04:08.227

04:12.799 --> 04:14.399
Uh...

04:20.072 --> 04:21.005
Hi.

04:21.074 --> 04:24.308
Look, whatever's gone wrong,

04:24.378 --> 04:26.745
I really can't do another
escapade today.

04:26.813 --> 04:28.733
No. No escapades, no
scar, no running from Rayna.

04:28.782 --> 04:31.448
And thank you for your
help with that, by the way.

04:31.517 --> 04:35.285
Not like I had a choice,
but... you're welcome.

04:37.256 --> 04:39.423
So, anyway, I was actually hoping

04:39.492 --> 04:41.558
to, uh, speak to Caroline.

04:41.627 --> 04:43.927

Ah.

04:51.168 --> 04:52.234
Yeah.

04:52.303 --> 04:54.036
Yeah, sure. Come on.

04:54.105 --> 04:55.772
Thanks.

05:01.579 --> 05:04.012
You know, the odds of
us getting through this

05:04.080 --> 05:06.415
without a single word being spoken...

05:06.483 --> 05:08.349
Lots of words can be spoken.

05:08.419 --> 05:10.585
Just don't want him to speak any to me.

05:10.654 --> 05:13.422
(chuckles) I thought we'd gotten
past the anger stage.

05:13.490 --> 05:15.390
We had.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.925
We were blissfully not angry

05:16.993 --> 05:19.895
because we had blissfully
moved on from Damon and his selfish,

05:19.963 --> 05:22.162
narcissistic existence,
but when someone who you have

05:22.231 --> 05:24.832
erased from your mind has the audacity
to show up at your door

05:24.901 --> 05:26.734

05:26.803 --> 05:28.502

Okay.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.371
(sighs)

10:50.440 --> 10:52.273
You've been chasing vampires

10:52.342 --> 10:55.009
every day of your eight lives.

10:55.078 --> 10:56.310
Every day.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.679
Then a couple of renegade heretics went

10:58.749 --> 11:01.314
and blew up the Phoenix
Stone, and now a bunch

11:01.383 --> 11:03.063
of its prisoners are
out in the wind again.

11:03.119 --> 11:06.386
So for the rest of your remaining
days, you will have

11:06.455 --> 11:08.655
to chase those vampires
to the ends of the Earth

11:08.724 --> 11:10.924
until you're too old and too
weak, and, you know what,

11:10.993 --> 11:13.794
you'll probably die before
you can finish the task

11:13.863 --> 11:17.064
you've been compelled
by destiny to complete.

11:17.133 --> 11:19.698
Or you can let us do your
dirty work over the next few days,

11:19.768 --> 11:22.769

11:28.810 --> 11:30.276
Prove what?

psychic connections to conjure up

11:51.631 --> 11:53.697
a Google map or anything, huh?

11:53.766 --> 11:56.333
The way I see it, those
pills you've been using on Bonnie

11:56.402 --> 11:58.169
will wear off in the next 48 hours,

11:58.237 --> 12:00.070

escalate her illness.

12:03.409 --> 12:05.375

12:06.412 --> 12:09.138
You'd better get started.

12:19.422 --> 12:21.187
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:21.256 --> 12:23.256
Look.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.325
The girls are growing up so fast.

12:25.394 --> 12:28.228
They look like
footballs in pumpkin costumes.

12:28.296 --> 12:30.296
(laughs)

12:31.266 --> 12:32.565
What have you got there?

12:32.634 --> 12:35.035
Blueprints of the Armory's
underground levels.

12:35.103 --> 12:36.536
You ever been down there?

12:36.604 --> 12:38.337
(sighs) No, actually.

12:38.406 --> 12:40.805
Uh, Alex said they were all sealed off.

12:40.874 --> 12:43.808
I wonder what's down there.

12:43.877 --> 12:45.197
The Armory collects things, right?

12:45.212 --> 12:46.292
Every museum has an archive

12:46.313 --> 12:47.833
where they keep the really good stuff.

12:47.881 --> 12:49.681
What sort of good stuff?

12:49.750 --> 12:51.383
I don't know. Unique things.

12:51.452 --> 12:53.885
One-of-a-kind things. The
outliers of a collection.

12:53.954 --> 12:56.354
- Outliers?
- Uh-huh.

12:56.423 --> 12:58.556
I mean, maybe that's
why they wanted Elena.

12:58.624 --> 13:00.058
A doppelganger.

13:00.126 --> 13:01.492
And Rayna Cruz.

13:01.561 --> 13:03.428
A shamanic huntress with multiple lives.

13:03.496 --> 13:04.828
And me.

13:04.897 --> 13:06.464
A terrible guitar player.

13:07.667 --> 13:10.568
(chuckles)

13:12.171 --> 13:14.538
You still haven't
burned this bloody letter?

13:14.606 --> 13:18.007
Every day I mean to, and
every day I decide not to.

13:21.813 --> 13:23.780
You know, he left me, too.

13:23.848 --> 13:25.048
Damon.

13:25.117 --> 13:27.750
We were best mates, side by side

13:27.819 --> 13:29.818
in Augustine cells for five years,

13:29.887 --> 13:32.455
each other's only friend.

13:32.523 --> 13:33.922
We gave each other hope.

13:33.991 --> 13:37.326
And then, one day, instead
of implementing an escape plan

13:37.395 --> 13:40.796
we formulated together, he
left me in a burning cage to die.

13:40.864 --> 13:42.465
So... (chuckles)

13:42.533 --> 13:45.600
believe me when I tell
you that I know how you feel.

13:47.770 --> 13:51.973
And, look, let me just spare
you the 50 years of mental anguish.

13:52.041 --> 13:53.174
It's not you, it's him.

13:53.243 --> 13:55.176
It's just who Damon is.

13:55.245 --> 13:57.678
So stop wasting your time

13:57.747 --> 14:00.615
trying to figure out if
it's something you did.

14:02.618 --> 14:04.084
Someone like you,

14:04.153 --> 14:06.853
with all that fire and passion and...

14:06.922 --> 14:10.090
loyalty,

14:10.159 --> 14:13.260
you deserve much, much better than that.

14:18.434 --> 14:20.099
Care and the girls left in a hurry.

14:20.168 --> 14:21.767
Trying to stay under the radar

14:21.836 --> 14:23.302
till this Rayna thing blows over.

14:23.371 --> 14:24.670
No, no, it's, uh... it's nice.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.973
Yeah, thanks. You'd be
amazed what you can accomplish

14:28.042 --> 14:30.276
when your fiancée can
compel an interior designer

14:30.345 --> 14:32.411
and an entire homeowners' association.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.448
Mm. Thought you were,
uh, out of the game.

14:35.517 --> 14:36.848
What do you mean?

14:36.916 --> 14:40.452
Well, the... supernatural world.

14:40.521 --> 14:41.786
Oh, yeah, we are.

14:41.855 --> 14:43.388
But have you ever dealt with
a homeowners' association?

14:43.457 --> 14:47.192
No, no. Can't say that I have.

14:50.597 --> 14:52.397
Uh, look, uh, I'd offer you something,

14:52.466 --> 14:54.365
but I haven't been to
the store in a while,

14:54.433 --> 14:57.168
so unless you want a juice
box or some string cheese,

14:57.236 --> 14:59.102
I suggest we go somewhere else.

14:59.172 --> 15:02.473
I could probably use something stronger.

15:06.312 --> 15:09.446
Ground control to Rayna Cruz.

15:09.515 --> 15:10.846
What's our mission?

15:10.915 --> 15:13.183
I'm sending you back towards Texas,

15:13.251 --> 15:15.218
where the hellstone got destroyed.

15:15.287 --> 15:18.555
Think of that as the...
center of the blast.

15:18.623 --> 15:21.090
Vampire souls scattered
out in all directions,

15:21.159 --> 15:22.592
landing every which way.

15:22.661 --> 15:25.228
I can see the places they go

15:25.297 --> 15:29.565
and the people they kill, things
they see with their eyes.

15:32.636 --> 15:33.868
Your next target is

15:33.937 --> 15:35.671
in Richmond.

15:35.739 --> 15:37.506
Inside a bright, clean room.

15:37.575 --> 15:39.808
Oh, yeah. I know exactly where that is.

15:39.876 --> 15:42.043
Please tell us you're gonna
give us more clues than that.

15:42.112 --> 15:44.312
(sighs) You will, as they come to me.

15:44.380 --> 15:48.282
I... I know it's not a lot to go on,

15:48.351 --> 15:49.951
but I'm hoping we can
put together enough

15:49.952 --> 15:51.552
so that you guys can

15:51.621 --> 15:52.886
prove your effectiveness.

15:52.955 --> 15:55.289
Wow. You guys hearing this?

15:55.358 --> 15:57.991
Sorry, I'm just
having a lot of difficulty

15:58.060 --> 16:00.294
wrapping my head around this new...

16:00.363 --> 16:03.196
cooperative team leader version of you.

16:03.265 --> 16:04.831
You've always hated us.

16:04.899 --> 16:05.832
Yeah,

16:05.900 --> 16:08.101
but I'm tired, you know?

16:08.169 --> 16:10.337
Multiple lifetimes-tired.

16:10.405 --> 16:12.839
You realize that in over
100 years on this planet,

16:12.907 --> 16:16.008
I've never had even one day off.

16:16.077 --> 16:17.944
I just want a day

16:18.012 --> 16:20.746
without vampires.

16:20.814 --> 16:22.981
One free day where I can...

16:23.050 --> 16:26.685
feel the sun on my
face, eat a cheeseburger,

16:26.754 --> 16:29.488
watch the ocean.

16:29.557 --> 16:33.359
Enjoy a few simple pleasures, for once.

16:35.229 --> 16:37.528
And then go to sleep.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.897
Tell you what, why
don't we circle back to

16:39.966 --> 16:40.965
the situation at hand.

16:41.033 --> 16:42.634
Where are you sending us next?

16:42.702 --> 16:44.435
(sniffles)

16:47.307 --> 16:49.940
I'm seeing a lot of teeth.

16:53.845 --> 16:55.512
(bite crunches)

16:55.581 --> 16:57.847
I hope word of this doesn't get out.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.316
(grunts)

16:59.385 --> 17:01.050
(snarling)

17:02.388 --> 17:04.387
People already hate
going to the dentist.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.391
(grunting)

17:14.898 --> 17:16.398
(grunting)

17:22.740 --> 17:23.271
(grunts)

17:23.340 --> 17:25.073
(shouts)

17:25.142 --> 17:26.808
His heart's not in his ankle, Bonnie.

17:26.876 --> 17:28.410
Shut up. This thing has a kick.

17:31.548 --> 17:32.280
(grunts)

17:32.349 --> 17:33.281
Now.

17:36.820 --> 17:38.386
(shouts)

17:43.259 --> 17:45.091
(panting)

17:45.160 --> 17:49.029
Uh, that wasn't so hard.

17:56.198 --> 18:00.173
_

18:07.922 --> 18:09.855
What?

18:09.924 --> 18:13.125
It's New Year's Eve.

18:13.194 --> 18:14.927
Get up. We're having dinner.

18:14.996 --> 18:17.462
Mm. Oh, and for the love of God,

18:17.531 --> 18:20.999
please put on something
besides these abhorrent sweatpants.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.101
What do you care about my sweatpants?

18:23.170 --> 18:25.704
I'm instituting a dress code.

18:25.773 --> 18:28.139
For the holiday.

18:30.210 --> 18:33.345
This is the best I could do...

18:36.683 --> 18:39.550
I thought you
deserved a proper celebration.

18:53.598 --> 18:55.832
If you would've told me a year ago

18:55.900 --> 18:57.534
we would be spending New
Year's Eve together,

18:57.602 --> 18:59.068
I would have called you crazy.

18:59.137 --> 19:00.437
(chuckles)

19:00.505 --> 19:02.706
Well, you've called me far
worse than that in the past.

19:04.008 --> 19:06.509
So I was thinking about your cousin.

19:06.578 --> 19:09.378
Whatever you want to call her... Alex.

19:09.447 --> 19:11.413
How you said she never
wanted to discuss her siblings.

19:11.482 --> 19:12.781
(gentle jazz music playing)

19:12.850 --> 19:14.750
But her sister
Virginia's journal talks about

19:14.819 --> 19:15.917
how close they were.

19:15.986 --> 19:18.053
What else does Virginia say?

19:18.121 --> 19:20.989
Kind of off-balance.

19:22.893 --> 19:24.993
Seems to hate
everything your family stands for.

19:25.062 --> 19:27.628
Well, at least she knows what that is.

19:27.697 --> 19:29.964
I'm still trying to figure it out.

19:30.032 --> 19:31.298
Why do you care?

19:31.368 --> 19:33.100
Hmm?

19:33.169 --> 19:34.569
They abandoned you.

19:34.637 --> 19:36.738
(scoffs) Left you at a workhouse.

19:38.641 --> 19:40.575
You have two parents, right?

19:40.643 --> 19:42.576
Oh, sorry. Um, had.

19:42.644 --> 19:44.745
I know your dad died.

19:44.813 --> 19:47.113
I had none.

19:47.182 --> 19:49.115
Curiosity about what they stand for

19:49.184 --> 19:52.352
is what keeps me from
hating them for leaving me.

19:53.819 --> 19:55.422
What?

19:55.491 --> 19:56.757
Nothing.

19:56.825 --> 19:58.224
- What?
- Nothing.

19:58.293 --> 20:01.427
Just, after all this time,

20:01.496 --> 20:05.731
I think I'm finally
starting to understand you.

20:13.508 --> 20:15.073
(exhales)

20:17.477 --> 20:18.976
May I have this dance?

20:19.045 --> 20:20.845
Really?

20:22.716 --> 20:24.849

Not counting guitar practice.

20:46.939 --> 20:49.239
Eh, getting better.

And the fire-building.

22:16.990 --> 22:18.523
You're not gonna answer that?

22:18.591 --> 22:20.925
Damon and I are on a bit of a time-out.

22:20.994 --> 22:23.027
Really? And after all that trouble

22:23.095 --> 22:25.295
he went through to get that
psychopath out of your body.

Well, he's half the
reason that psychopath

22:27.133 --> 22:29.133
- was in my body in the first place.
- (phone vibrating)

22:29.168 --> 22:32.869
These last few days have
been a painful reminder

22:32.938 --> 22:35.505
of the complicated
nature of our relationship.

22:35.574 --> 22:38.675
Okay, Stefan.

22:38.744 --> 22:39.976
What happened?

22:40.045 --> 22:42.278
Three years ago, you told Caroline

22:42.347 --> 22:44.981
you'd be with her when things were safe.

22:45.050 --> 22:48.451
Rayna got locked
up... and you never showed.

22:48.520 --> 22:52.454
Well, that's not
exactly how it went down.

22:52.523 --> 22:54.489
Well, that's how it
went down for Caroline.

22:54.559 --> 22:56.625
There's more to the story.

22:56.694 --> 22:58.493
Nothing you felt like sharing?

22:58.563 --> 23:01.463
Not at the time, no.

23:01.532 --> 23:04.132
But now... now you're ready.

23:04.201 --> 23:06.801
Right. That's why you're here.

23:06.870 --> 23:08.703
I mean, forget you
couldn't manage even a postcard

23:08.772 --> 23:11.205
these last three years, but
now that she's built a new life,

23:11.274 --> 23:13.174
there's a wedding on the
books, and you're just

23:13.242 --> 23:14.609
popping in to share

23:14.678 --> 23:15.810
your side of the story.

23:15.879 --> 23:17.779
Look, I made a choice back then,

23:17.847 --> 23:21.049
and I think that she
deserves to know what and why.

23:22.218 --> 23:23.451
Wow, that's...

23:23.519 --> 23:26.687
really nice of you, Stefan, you know?

23:26.755 --> 23:30.490
Because I think she
deserved to know the what and why,

23:30.559 --> 23:32.826
you know, before you stopped calling.

23:32.895 --> 23:35.295
- It broke her heart.
- (phone vibrating)

23:35.363 --> 23:37.497
Will you just answer the
damn phone, please?

23:38.567 --> 23:40.333
What?

23:40.402 --> 23:41.366
Where are you?

23:41.435 --> 23:43.268
I'm trying to pick up the pieces

23:43.337 --> 23:45.437
of my broken life, and
something tells me

23:45.506 --> 23:47.039
you're about to disrupt that.

23:47.108 --> 23:48.574
Gold-star guess, brother.

23:48.643 --> 23:50.209
Listen, I need some well-armed backup.

23:50.277 --> 23:52.912
Any chance you can get your
hands on a vamp arsenal?

23:54.782 --> 23:56.248
Probably. Why?

23:56.317 --> 23:58.249
Long story. It involves Rayna

23:58.318 --> 24:01.019
and some pretty
nasty Phoenix Stone vamps

24:01.088 --> 24:03.187
and, uh...

24:03.256 --> 24:05.256
I'm trying to save someone who hates me.

24:05.325 --> 24:07.892
Which one? There are so many.

24:07.961 --> 24:09.961
Bonnie's in trouble, Stefan.

24:11.164 --> 24:12.263
Now, I know you don't

24:12.332 --> 24:14.965
owe me anything, but
I really need the help.

24:19.672 --> 24:22.472
I'm with Ric. Just
tell us what we can do.

24:28.351 --> 24:31.749

Huh. This Bonnie and Clyde
and Clyde routine

25:16.442 --> 25:18.375
is starting to improve your aim.

25:18.444 --> 25:20.611
I just picture your face as the target.

25:20.679 --> 25:22.713
♪ Kiss this. ♪

25:35.693 --> 25:37.359
Been looking for you, cousin.

25:37.429 --> 25:39.161
I'm flattered.

25:39.230 --> 25:41.230
Not too hard to find you,

25:41.299 --> 25:43.599
seeing as you've left a
trail of vampire corpses

25:43.668 --> 25:44.634
across the southeast.

25:44.702 --> 25:47.437
Before you think about hurting me,

25:47.505 --> 25:49.371
my team knows where I am.

25:49.440 --> 25:53.174
One text from me, and
they'll storm the entire building.

25:53.243 --> 25:55.076
Somehow I don't think you want that.

25:55.145 --> 25:57.345
Well, it makes no
difference to me. I'm in here alone.

25:57.414 --> 25:58.513
ALEX: Doing what?

25:58.582 --> 26:00.214
(mouthing)

26:00.283 --> 26:02.784
Shopping for chairs, of course.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.218
You can't keep hiding her from me.

26:04.287 --> 26:05.520
(Enzo sighs)

26:05.589 --> 26:07.588
I don't control Bonnie's movements.

26:07.657 --> 26:09.590
So, it was her idea to go undercover

26:09.659 --> 26:12.893
at the psychiatric ward?

26:12.962 --> 26:16.029
There was an incident at my
sister's hospital yesterday.

26:16.098 --> 26:17.832
I was notified with all the details.

26:17.900 --> 26:21.268
Virginia often has violent episodes.

26:21.337 --> 26:23.603
That's why I had her committed.

26:23.672 --> 26:25.805
After she killed Lucy Bennett.

26:27.476 --> 26:28.575
You didn't know?

26:28.643 --> 26:30.543
Why on earth would I know that?

26:32.013 --> 26:35.314
Four years ago, Virginia
forced Lucy to seal a vault

26:35.383 --> 26:37.450
in the Armory with magic.

26:37.519 --> 26:39.853
Only problem was our other sister Yvette

26:39.921 --> 26:42.053
was still inside when they closed it.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.723
I need to get her out.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.758
Bonnie can help me do that.

26:46.827 --> 26:48.994
I... Sorry, I don't mean to be callous,

26:49.062 --> 26:52.731
but unless that vault has
a well-stocked kitchen,

26:52.800 --> 26:55.400
I'm afraid your sister
has died of starvation.

26:55.469 --> 26:58.068
You're wrong.

26:58.137 --> 27:01.939
Something has kept her alive in there.

27:02.008 --> 27:05.676
I can hear her voice calling
to me for help.

27:05.745 --> 27:08.779
It's my fault that she's suffering.

27:10.583 --> 27:12.717
I know you
understand that kind of guilt.

27:12.785 --> 27:15.284
I am sure that you did
not come here so we could

27:15.353 --> 27:16.452
discuss our feelings.

27:16.522 --> 27:19.422
Your situation is untenable.

27:19.491 --> 27:21.424
You care for a girl that probably

27:21.493 --> 27:22.626
doesn't have long to live.

27:22.694 --> 27:26.329
I need that girl to perform
a simple spell

27:26.398 --> 27:29.566
so I can put our family back together.

27:29.635 --> 27:31.567
I feel like you and I could solve

27:31.636 --> 27:34.703
each other's problems, Lorenzo.

27:34.772 --> 27:37.139
Bring me Bonnie Bennett,

27:37.207 --> 27:41.476
and I will do
everything I can to save her life.

27:44.782 --> 27:47.182
Enzo's a big boy. He
can take care of himself.

27:47.251 --> 27:48.616
I don't want to talk to you.

27:48.685 --> 27:50.885
Look, Bonnie, had Alex seen you,

27:50.954 --> 27:52.787
she would have called in her SWAT team

27:52.856 --> 27:54.522
and all this would
have been for nothing.

27:54.591 --> 27:55.723
We had to jet.

27:55.792 --> 27:57.124
I'm tired, Damon.

27:57.193 --> 27:58.993
And I don't feel good

27:59.062 --> 28:02.329
and I'm worried about Enzo,
so stop trying so hard, okay?

28:02.398 --> 28:04.566
(phone vibrates)

28:04.634 --> 28:06.667
Please tell me you're all right.

28:06.735 --> 28:08.735
Don't worry about me, luv.

28:08.804 --> 28:11.004
Our cousin Alex only
wanted to have a chat,

28:11.073 --> 28:12.205
and then she let me go.

28:12.274 --> 28:13.740
That's not sketchy at all.

28:13.809 --> 28:14.708
Agreed.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.142
Is she still looking for me?

28:16.211 --> 28:17.343
Of course.

28:17.412 --> 28:19.680
Yeah, she's still banging
on about this vault

28:19.748 --> 28:21.949
and how we should both work together.

28:22.017 --> 28:24.550
You know, I actually
think she's being sincere.

28:24.619 --> 28:26.619
And here I thought your new boyfriend

28:26.688 --> 28:28.454
was actually smarter than your last one.

28:28.522 --> 28:29.889
We don't trust her, Damon.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.090
No,

28:31.158 --> 28:33.158
not for a second.

28:33.227 --> 28:35.461
She's closing in.

28:35.529 --> 28:37.196
So, look, after I wrestle myself a car,

28:37.264 --> 28:38.598
I'll meet back up with you

28:38.666 --> 28:40.665
and we'll get back to
Rayna's list, all right?

28:44.571 --> 28:45.937
Hello? You still there?

28:47.708 --> 28:50.541
Yeah. Just one problem.

28:50.611 --> 28:52.143
From what you know about the sickness,

28:52.212 --> 28:55.179
how much time do I
have left after the, uh,

28:55.248 --> 28:56.780
first scab appears?

28:58.117 --> 28:59.683
Um...

28:59.752 --> 29:02.199
a week, maybe less.

29:17.409 --> 29:19.509
(engine stops)

29:25.818 --> 29:28.185
(guitar music playing in distance)

29:36.161 --> 29:38.261
(guitar music continues)

29:49.740 --> 29:51.420
I only heard two
dogs howling at the noise.

29:51.475 --> 29:54.910
Hilarious, as always.

29:54.979 --> 29:56.879
You stayed away long enough.

29:56.947 --> 29:59.348
Yeah. Been busy at work.

29:59.416 --> 30:01.917
Have me traveling more than I hoped.

30:01.986 --> 30:04.486
(sighs)

30:04.554 --> 30:05.634
I trust your other pastimes

30:05.654 --> 30:07.254
have borne more
results than your guitar?

30:08.391 --> 30:12.426
Well, the fireplace
is burning perfectly.

30:12.495 --> 30:16.097
And I found
something in Virginia's diary.

30:16.165 --> 30:17.231
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

30:17.300 --> 30:20.434
She knew my cousin, Lucy Bennett.

30:25.107 --> 30:27.374
It's a bill from a psychiatric hospital

30:27.442 --> 30:30.176
in Asheville, North Carolina.

30:30.245 --> 30:34.915
Virginia's been a patient
there for the past three years.

30:34.983 --> 30:37.217
She might have an idea
about why the Bennett bloodline

30:37.286 --> 30:38.885
is so important to Alex.

30:40.788 --> 30:42.087
Color me impressed.

30:42.156 --> 30:45.090
New year, new me.

30:45.159 --> 30:47.960
A new mastery over an instrument.

30:49.663 --> 30:50.829
No?

30:50.898 --> 30:51.997
Let me show you.

30:52.066 --> 30:53.565
I was doing it.

30:53.634 --> 30:55.067
Not really. Here.

30:55.136 --> 30:56.534
- (laughs)
- This is it.

30:56.602 --> 30:58.970
- Okay.
- You want to loosen up your hands.

30:59.039 --> 31:01.705
In there.

31:01.774 --> 31:03.274
And strum.

31:03.343 --> 31:05.509
(plays a chord)

31:05.578 --> 31:08.512
Yeah, now back to the one chord.

31:08.581 --> 31:10.514
Right. There you go.

31:12.685 --> 31:13.883

BONNIE: Don't be ridiculous.

32:08.237 --> 32:10.570
ENZO: Come now, surely this qualifies
as a date, of a sort.

32:10.639 --> 32:12.272
Nice try. Doesn't count. Doesn't it?

32:12.341 --> 32:13.974
- Not unless...

32:14.043 --> 32:15.575
- Unless what?
- (line ringing)

32:15.644 --> 32:17.411
- STEFAN: Yeah?
- Talk to me.

32:17.480 --> 32:19.613
About anything, please.

32:19.681 --> 32:21.647
I need new pictures in my head.

32:21.716 --> 32:23.082
Trees. Sky.

32:23.151 --> 32:24.817
Vervain grenades.

32:24.886 --> 32:27.120
(sighs) Much better. Thank you.

32:27.188 --> 32:28.988
How's Bonnie doing?

32:29.057 --> 32:30.656
Not as well as she's pretending to be.

32:30.725 --> 32:32.025
How's Ric holding up?

32:32.093 --> 32:34.160
He's circling around the next campsite

32:34.229 --> 32:36.462
to lay cover fire on any egress routes.

32:36.531 --> 32:37.959
I don't know. His words, not mine.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.140
So he's having fun.

32:39.301 --> 32:40.428
He's only tolerating me

32:40.429 --> 32:41.966
because we're doing this for Bonnie.

32:42.036 --> 32:43.368
And if this is how Ric feels,

32:43.437 --> 32:45.437
imagine how much worse it's
gonna be with Caroline.

32:45.439 --> 32:47.105
Lighten up. Anything's possible.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.674
I mean, look, take me
and Bon-Bon, for instance.

32:49.743 --> 32:51.576
Getting better every day.

32:51.645 --> 32:52.944
(phone vibrates)

32:53.013 --> 32:54.812
Whoa, I got to jump.

32:54.881 --> 32:57.614
Rayna's got a bead on
our nasty little runaways.

32:57.683 --> 32:59.383
It's go time.

32:59.452 --> 33:02.119
(crunching)

33:04.623 --> 33:05.789
Let's get 'Er done.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.058
(shouting)

33:09.862 --> 33:11.795
(grunts, shouts)

33:11.864 --> 33:14.030
Lorenzo, don't.

33:14.099 --> 33:15.765
I'm a friend.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.100
Sorry. I don't know you.

33:17.169 --> 33:19.502
Of course you don't
recognize me in this body.

33:19.571 --> 33:20.836
It's me... Beau.

33:23.108 --> 33:25.275
Beau the heretic? Wow.

33:25.343 --> 33:26.409
Small world.

33:26.478 --> 33:27.944
Well, welcome back.

33:28.012 --> 33:28.945
And good-bye.

33:29.013 --> 33:29.978
Don't kill him.

33:30.047 --> 33:31.947
He's on the list, Bonnie.

33:32.015 --> 33:33.215
It's not up for debate.

33:33.284 --> 33:36.251
He helped save Caroline's life.

33:36.320 --> 33:37.786
And her kids.

33:37.854 --> 33:39.354
I'm not gonna let you murder him.

33:39.423 --> 33:41.390
Oh, come on. Really?

33:44.161 --> 33:45.827
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Take a walk.

33:45.896 --> 33:47.895
Get a half-caf soy...

33:47.964 --> 33:49.630
And you still don't even know my drink.

33:49.699 --> 33:50.931
And by the time you get back,

33:51.000 --> 33:53.067
Old Yeller will already
be taken out to the barn.

33:53.267 --> 33:55.836
This is so like you.

33:55.905 --> 33:56.937
Which part?

33:57.006 --> 33:58.473
Classic analogies?

33:59.375 --> 34:00.408
(screams)

34:04.346 --> 34:07.481
Or that I don't ask
permission to do what needs to be done?

34:19.612 --> 34:21.659
What if Bleeding Heart
Bonnie doesn't want

34:21.728 --> 34:22.995
to take out the next one?

34:23.063 --> 34:25.498
Well, this sounds like the
beginning of an accusation.

34:25.565 --> 34:26.599
In case you forgot, sparing Beau

34:26.667 --> 34:27.866
would've been a huge deal breaker.

34:27.935 --> 34:29.935
Well, it's a good thing you
took care of him, then.

34:29.969 --> 34:31.036
That's what I do.

34:31.105 --> 34:33.005
I take care of things. And people.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.639
I don't give them pills that kill them

34:34.708 --> 34:36.074
and let their own stupid judgment

34:36.143 --> 34:37.442
put their lives in danger

34:37.511 --> 34:38.643
even more.

34:38.710 --> 34:41.446
No. No, you're just
gonna lie down in a coffin,

34:41.514 --> 34:42.594
hope that when you wake up,

34:42.616 --> 34:45.416
the mess you made will be cleaned up.

34:46.652 --> 34:48.585
I made a mistake.

34:48.655 --> 34:50.288
You made a choice.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.461
I desiccated because I
didn't want to hurt my friends.

34:57.530 --> 34:59.429
But I am holding you
personally responsible

34:59.498 --> 35:01.632
if anything happens to Bonnie.

35:01.700 --> 35:02.633
I will hunt you down

35:02.701 --> 35:04.701
and rip your heart out of your chest.

35:04.770 --> 35:06.770
BONNIE: Damon!

35:21.118 --> 35:23.118
It's his fault, Bonnie, all of it.

35:23.188 --> 35:24.353
Do you really believe that?

35:24.422 --> 35:26.121
There's no other
factor you can think of?

35:26.191 --> 35:29.824
You want to hear me
say I made a mistake, huh?

35:29.893 --> 35:31.092
Okay, fine.

35:31.161 --> 35:33.428
I made a mistake
three years ago, Bonnie.

35:33.497 --> 35:34.537
I shouldn't have given up.

35:34.598 --> 35:36.631
I shouldn't have run away!

35:36.700 --> 35:39.634
But you did.

35:39.703 --> 35:42.504
And I got over it.

35:42.573 --> 35:45.139
Yet you still carry my letter with you.

35:45.208 --> 35:46.507
Yeah.

35:46.576 --> 35:48.809
Yeah, I keep it.

35:48.877 --> 35:51.778
Keep it as a reminder to
not trust the wrong people.

35:51.847 --> 35:53.614
Well, you're not doing too well, sister.

35:53.683 --> 35:54.415
Enzo here...

35:54.483 --> 35:55.882
Enzo has been there for me!

35:57.720 --> 35:59.486
Every single day.

35:59.555 --> 36:01.088
Hiding me.

36:01.156 --> 36:02.122
Protecting me.

36:02.191 --> 36:03.155
Poisoning you!

36:03.225 --> 36:04.156
He'll figure it out!

36:04.226 --> 36:05.146
And what if he doesn't?

36:05.159 --> 36:06.292
Then I'll die!

36:08.129 --> 36:10.257
But at least I'll do
it with him by my side.

36:10.565 --> 36:12.941
I love him, Damon.

36:13.103 --> 36:14.910
And I know

36:15.052 --> 36:19.676
that no matter what
happens, he won't leave me.

36:35.364 --> 36:37.464
This part I really don't miss.

36:37.533 --> 36:40.300
Yeah, but the part where
you helped Bonnie,

36:40.368 --> 36:42.335
that wasn't too terrible, was it?

36:42.404 --> 36:43.303
Don't.

36:43.371 --> 36:44.704
Don't what?

36:44.773 --> 36:46.640
Don't try to get the band back together.

36:48.076 --> 36:50.176
Yes, all hands are on deck right now,

36:50.245 --> 36:51.711
but that doesn't make us friends

36:51.780 --> 36:54.613
or earn you a place back
in Caroline's life, okay?

36:56.250 --> 36:57.382
Well...

36:57.452 --> 36:59.052
I think that's something
that she's gonna

36:59.053 --> 37:00.986
have to decide for herself.

37:03.123 --> 37:06.124
You know, you're
wasting your time, Stefan.

37:06.193 --> 37:08.527
Let me tell you a little story.

37:08.596 --> 37:11.395
When we moved to Dallas, Caroline
joined a book club.

37:11.465 --> 37:13.030
You know, it seemed like a good idea.

37:13.099 --> 37:16.200
At first, it was once a week.

37:16.269 --> 37:17.502
And then it was twice a week.

37:17.571 --> 37:20.071
Then she started coming
home later and later.

37:20.139 --> 37:21.873
So one night I followed her.

37:21.942 --> 37:24.075
Sounds healthy.

37:24.143 --> 37:25.409
The point is this.

37:25.479 --> 37:27.178
There was no book club.

37:27.246 --> 37:28.579
Turns out, she'd park her car

37:28.647 --> 37:30.948
down by the river so she could cry,

37:31.016 --> 37:33.049
alone.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.919
And then something happened.

37:35.988 --> 37:39.756
She stopped making
excuses to be somewhere else.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.593
And the girls and I stopped
being a placeholder.

37:42.661 --> 37:44.894
And we became her life.

37:46.230 --> 37:47.630
I get all that.

37:47.699 --> 37:48.430
No.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.733
No, you don't, Stefan.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.803
She doesn't want to see you.

37:53.872 --> 37:56.639
Trust me.

37:56.708 --> 37:58.774
You know her pretty well, huh?

38:00.678 --> 38:03.344
Better than anyone now.

38:03.413 --> 38:04.853
So who sleeps in the second bedroom?

38:08.051 --> 38:09.918
Excuse me?

38:09.987 --> 38:11.219
Well, I was at your house.

38:11.287 --> 38:12.921
I saw the nursery for the twins.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.657
And I also saw two separate bedrooms.

38:15.726 --> 38:18.393
And then I saw an
appointment for a justice of the peace,

38:18.461 --> 38:21.128
which doesn't seem very Caroline Forbes.

38:21.196 --> 38:23.531
So tell me.

38:23.599 --> 38:26.667
After you get home
from City Hall on Friday,

38:26.736 --> 38:29.837
is that when she's gonna start
sleeping in your bed?

38:32.174 --> 38:34.441
That's none of your business.

38:34.510 --> 38:37.544
You can make look your relationship
look good on paper,

38:37.612 --> 38:41.347
but deep down, it's a lie.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.921
I know she doesn't love me.

38:47.989 --> 38:51.190
But our life is not a lie.

38:51.259 --> 38:53.692
All I can do is be worthy of her,

38:53.761 --> 38:55.994
Stefan.

38:56.063 --> 38:58.396
Which is more than you've ever been.

39:06.073 --> 39:08.740
(liquid pouring)

39:15.281 --> 39:18.916
Not to be a crybaby, but...

39:18.985 --> 39:22.853
these feel a lot worse than they look.

39:22.922 --> 39:25.255
Don't think I'll get much playing in.

39:25.324 --> 39:27.757
Aw, that's a shame, luv.

39:27.826 --> 39:29.960
You're in dire need of practice.

39:30.028 --> 39:32.361
(chuckles)

39:33.732 --> 39:36.866
(laughs) Go ahead, go ahead.

39:38.937 --> 39:40.870
(Bonnie hums)

39:45.142 --> 39:46.541
No, you're trying to look.

39:46.611 --> 39:47.409
(laughs)

39:47.478 --> 39:48.410
Gonna make you...

39:48.479 --> 39:49.878
Go ahead.

39:49.947 --> 39:51.880
(both laugh)

39:54.151 --> 39:55.117
Impressive.

39:55.185 --> 39:56.351
No, you're peeking!

39:56.420 --> 39:58.453
You're totally peeking.

39:58.522 --> 40:01.555
No, I can see you're
side-eyeing the guitar.

40:01.625 --> 40:03.024
Don't mind me.

40:03.093 --> 40:04.558
I'm just gonna

40:04.628 --> 40:07.361
go get the next name out of the job jar.

40:08.264 --> 40:10.397
(door creaks)

40:13.569 --> 40:15.703
(door closes)

40:19.274 --> 40:20.607
Ric.

40:20.676 --> 40:23.744
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

40:23.812 --> 40:26.647
Look, this didn't go how
I wanted it to, all right?

40:26.715 --> 40:28.815
Really? You think you
can just show up here

40:28.884 --> 40:30.216
and everything's just gonna

40:30.285 --> 40:31.652
magically work itself...?

40:38.960 --> 40:41.393
Caroline.

40:50.138 --> 40:52.070
Uh, hey.

40:52.139 --> 40:53.638
We just got back.

40:53.707 --> 40:55.239
LIZZIE: Mommy, read us a story.

40:55.308 --> 40:57.809
Yeah, in a minute, honey.

40:58.945 --> 41:01.345
I can put them to bed if you want to...

41:01.414 --> 41:02.346
No.

41:02.415 --> 41:03.982
No, I got it.

41:04.051 --> 41:05.650
Happy you're home.

41:17.096 --> 41:19.029
(phone chimes)

41:26.504 --> 41:27.804
What's wrong?

41:27.872 --> 41:29.232
DAMON: Remember how Rayna was gonna

41:29.240 --> 41:32.108
give Bonnie her last life after
we finished her hit list?

41:32.177 --> 41:33.342
Well, the good news is

41:33.411 --> 41:36.245
she finally said yes to that deal.

41:36.314 --> 41:39.315
The not-as-good news is

41:39.383 --> 41:42.518
she added a few more names to the list.
