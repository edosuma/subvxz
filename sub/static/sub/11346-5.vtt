- OKAY, HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN
SINCE YOU SPOKE TO HIM?

04:22.463 --> 04:24.365
- AN HOUR AGO.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.300
HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT--
IT'S ME.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.374
- DID YOU SEE HER BABY?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.876

OUT THE DOOR, IN A HURRY.

04:35.909 --> 04:37.445
SAID THE BABY WAS IN THE CAR.

04:37.478 --> 04:39.012
- DID YOU GET A LOOK
AT THE CAR?

04:39.046 --> 04:42.416
SEE ANYONE DRIVING IT AWAY?

04:42.450 --> 04:43.751
I WAS MAKING CHANGE,
SHE RAN OUT.

AND NATE WAS IN THE BACK SEAT.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.535
I WAS ONLY GONE FOR A MINUTE.

05:01.569 --> 05:03.103
- WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- HE NEEDED DIAPERS!

05:03.136 --> 05:05.373
I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE HIM.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.044
I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN CALM HIM DOWN.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.212
- OKAY, DETECTIVE AMARO'S
PRETTY GOOD AT THAT.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.583
- TIM DOESN'T LIKE COPS--
NOT BECAUSE OF ANYTHING BAD.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.851
WHY ARE YOU ASKING
ALL THESE QUESTIONS?

05:17.885 --> 05:18.952
- BECAUSE THERE MAYBE
SOMETHING THAT YOU KNOW,

05:18.986 --> 05:20.488
THAT YOU DON'T THINK
IS IMPORTANT.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.490

05:28.529 --> 05:30.498
WE SHOW UP--THERE'S SIX
GAY GUYS STAYING THERE.

05:30.531 --> 05:31.632

05:31.665 --> 05:33.033
WE'LL NEED
THE JERK-OFF'S NAME.

05:33.066 --> 05:34.968
- WE WERE A DAY LATE,
WE GOT A SLOW START.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.504
I WAS TOO TIRED TO DRIVE--

05:36.537 --> 05:37.971
WE PULLED OVER,
I SLEPT IN THE CAR.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.773
WHERE'S MY KID?

05:39.807 --> 05:40.941
WHERE'S MY SON?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.877

05:43.911 --> 05:46.113
WE PARKED--
TIM SAID HE'D BE RIGHT BACK.

05:46.146 --> 05:47.848
YOU NEED TO FIND NATE.

05:47.881 --> 05:50.384
HE'S LACTOSE INTOLERANT--
HE NEEDS SOY FORMULA.

05:50.418 --> 05:51.585
WHOEVER TOOK HIM
WON'T KNOW THAT.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.754
- WE'RE GOING

06:29.156 --> 06:31.058
NO WITNESSES TO THE CAR THEFT.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.860
- WE'VE GOT AN ALARM OUT
ON THE ACCORD,

06:32.893 --> 06:34.762
BUT THERE'S BEEN NO HITS
FROM THE TOLL BOOTHS.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.664

- UH, NO, BUT I CAN HAVE
SOMEBODY TAKE YOU OUTSIDE.

06:44.738 --> 06:46.139

NATE, HE STARTED TO GRAB
THE BUTTS OUT OF THE ASHTRAY.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.445
- WHY AM I IN THIS ROOM?

06:51.479 --> 06:53.113
- JUST TO GIVE YOU
SOME PRIVACY.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.915
JUST HAVE A SEAT.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.785
I WANT TO SEE HER.

07:05.626 --> 07:06.727
- THREE HOURS LATER,

07:06.760 --> 07:08.896
AND NO SIGN OF THE CAR
OR THE KID.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.798
LET'S VERIFY
THE PARENTS' VERSION.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.633
PULL SALE RECORDS,
CREDIT CARDS,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.535
AND TRACK THEIR ROUTE
INTO THE CITY.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.669
ANY HOLES
IN THEIR STORY?

07:15.703 --> 07:16.770
- NO, THEY'RE
BACKING EACH OTHER UP,

07:16.804 --> 07:18.005
BUT SHE'S DEFINITELY
AFRAID OF HIM.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.640
- AND HE'S GOT
SOME ISSUES.

07:19.673 --> 07:21.509
- I'LL GET IN TOUCH
WITH BUFFALO,

07:21.542 --> 07:23.010
FIND OUT WHAT'S
NOT ON PAPER.

07:23.043 --> 07:25.245
YOU TWO,
TALK TO THE CRAIGSLIST RENTER.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.749
I WANT TO KNOW THE LAST TIME
ANYONE OTHER THAN THESE TWO

07:28.782 --> 07:31.251
SAW THAT BABY ALIVE.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.620
- WHY ARE YOU STILL UP?

07:32.653 --> 07:33.987
YOU HAD TOO MUCH SUGAR.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.156
I TOLD YOU NOT TO EAT ALL--

07:36.189 --> 07:40.861
ALL RIGHT, ONE LAST PIECE,
THEN YOU BRUSH YOUR TEETH,

07:40.894 --> 07:42.663
AND YOU GO TO SLEEP.

07:42.696 --> 07:43.797
I LOVE YOU TOO.

07:46.700 --> 07:47.868
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.803
EVERYTHING'S A NEGOTIATION.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.172
- GEE, I WONDER WHERE
SHE GETS THAT FROM.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.042
- ANY SIGN OF NATE?

07:55.075 --> 07:57.010
- FROM A TIP LINE,
ON HALLOWEEN?

07:57.044 --> 07:59.179

07:59.212 --> 08:01.148
NO ONE'S SEEN ANYTHING.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.017
- SO WHAT'S YOUR GUT
ON TIM?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.186
- WELL, WE GOT OFF
TO A BAD START.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.589
I GOT IN HIS FACE,
HIS EGO'S UP.

08:08.622 --> 08:11.725
- AND SHE SAW YOU
AS PROTECTING HER.

08:11.759 --> 08:12.860
YOU WANT TO DO-SI-DO?

08:12.893 --> 08:14.595
- THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.

08:14.628 --> 08:18.031

08:27.708 --> 08:29.810
- SO NO CHARGES WERE FILED.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.679
- I'LL SEND FIN AND ROLLINS

- THEY? DID THEY HAVE
A BABY WITH THEM?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.995
[cell phone rings]
- I ONLY MET THE GUY.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.263
I SAID I HAD SOMETHING ELSE,

08:50.297 --> 08:52.600
BUT HE WAS A PAIN IN THE ASS
ABOUT HAVING A CRIB.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.601
WHAT'S THE BIGGY?

08:53.634 --> 08:55.268
KID THAT LITTLE,
YOU PUT IN A LAUNDRY BASKET.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.270
HEY, WE DONE?

08:57.304 --> 08:58.806
I GOT A PARTY.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.140
- IN THAT OUTFIT?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.042
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT LOOKING
TO GET LUCKY TONIGHT.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.343
- WELL, I HOPE YOU LIKE
HOT WINGS.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.879
WE'RE ON THE NEXT PLANE
TO BUFFALO.

09:05.913 --> 09:08.749
- TIM LOVES ME.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.051
HE NEVER HIT ME.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.887
- SO YOUR SISTER CALLED
THE POLICE FOR NO REASON?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.889
- SHE NEVER LIKED HIM.

09:15.923 --> 09:17.090
- ALLIE...

09:17.124 --> 09:19.960
WHAT YOU TELL ME,
IT'S TO HELP FIND NATE.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.262
YOU'RE NOT BEING DISLOYAL.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.799
- TIM'S JEALOUS...

09:25.833 --> 09:27.935
BECAUSE HE LOVES ME SO MUCH.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.804
WHEN I FIRST GOT PREGNANT,

09:30.838 --> 09:32.139
HE DIDN'T THINK
THE BABY WAS HIS.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.041
- ALL RIGHT,
BUT THIS REPORT--

09:34.074 --> 09:35.042
IT'S SIX MONTHS LATER.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.144
- IT'S DUMB.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.179
I HAD A DRINK WITH AN EX.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.681
TIM FOUND OUT,
HE GRABBED MY ARM,

09:40.714 --> 09:42.783
HE SHOOK ME A LITTLE--
MY SISTER OVERREACTED.

09:42.816 --> 09:45.285
- IS THAT WHAT HE SAID?

09:45.318 --> 09:46.754
- I CAN HANDLE TIM.

09:46.787 --> 09:49.757
HE WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR,
HIS MOOD--

09:49.790 --> 09:51.792
IT'S LIKE WAVES
COMING OFF HIM.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.894
I KNOW RIGHT AWAY
IF IT'S GOING TO BE A BAD NIGHT.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.162
- SO YOU CAN
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.631
BUT WHAT ABOUT NATE?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.233
DID TIM EVER
HAVE A BAD NIGHT WITH HIM?

10:00.267 --> 10:02.302
- TIM WOULD NEVER...

10:02.335 --> 10:05.773
WHEN NATE WAS BORN,
HE FELL IN LOVE.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.774
[sniffles]
TIM,

10:06.807 --> 10:09.009
HE TRIES TO BE
ALL TOUGH, BUT...

10:10.744 --> 10:13.613
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM,
HE WAS BAWLING.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.188
- IS THAT WHAT ALLIE SAID?

10:21.221 --> 10:22.756
WHAT?
THAT I HURT HER?

10:22.790 --> 10:26.159
- WELL, NO ONE'S MAKING
ANY ACCUSATIONS, BUT...

10:26.193 --> 10:28.361
WE HAVE THIS REPORT
FROM BUFFALO.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.163
- IT'S A MISUNDERSTANDING.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.364
THERE WERE NO CHARGES.

10:31.398 --> 10:35.368
- WELL, STILL,
I'D LIKE TO GET YOUR SIDE.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.838
- MY SIDE IS...

10:37.871 --> 10:40.273
HER BITCH SISTER HATES ME.

10:41.942 --> 10:43.310
- OKAY.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.679
- I SEE THE WAY THEY LOOK AT ME.

10:45.713 --> 10:46.780
THE TWO OF THEM--

10:46.814 --> 10:48.081
HER MOTHER AND HER SISTER.

10:48.115 --> 10:50.951
'CAUSE THE DAD LEFT
THEY HATE ALL MEN.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.920
- WELL, THAT'S GOT TO BE
FRUSTRATING.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.422
- I LOVE ALLIE.

10:55.455 --> 10:56.824
SHE KNOWS IT.
- WELL, STILL,

10:56.857 --> 10:58.091
PEOPLE YOU LOVE CAN MAKE YOU...

10:58.125 --> 10:59.827
ANGRY.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.795
ESPECIALLY PEOPLE YOU LOVE.

11:01.829 --> 11:03.296
- I APOLOGIZED.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.232
I WAS ON MY KNEES.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.300
- SO IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS?

11:07.334 --> 11:10.337
YOU...GET ANGRY
AND THEN YOU DO THINGS

11:10.370 --> 11:12.906
YOU REGRET?

11:12.940 --> 11:14.374
[knocking on door]

11:19.012 --> 11:20.113
- I WANT TO TALK TO ALLIE.

11:20.147 --> 11:21.782
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
PUTTING IN HER HEAD?

11:21.815 --> 11:23.951
- JUST SIT TIGHT.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.119
- WE MIGHT HAVE A LEAD
ON THE CAR--

11:26.153 --> 11:28.822
ABANDONED, OFF THE
WILLIS AVENUE BRIDGE.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.367
- ANYTHING?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.170
- WINDOW'S BROKEN.
- IS HE IN THERE?

11:43.203 --> 11:45.305
- NO.
POP THE TRUNK.

11:45.338 --> 11:47.040
- GET ME A LOCK PULLER.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.241
A LOCK PULLER--C'MON, C'MON,
C'MON, C'MON, C'MON!

11:48.275 --> 11:50.477
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO,
LET'S GO!

11:50.510 --> 11:52.746
- YOU GOT IT?
- YEAH.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.948
[lock clicks]

11:56.149 --> 11:59.319
- HE'S NOT HERE.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.221
WE NEED A LEVEL-ONE
MOBILIZATION.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.057
CHECK THE HILLSIDE,
CHECK THOSE WOODS.

12:04.091 --> 12:07.027
CHECK THE EMBANKMENT,
GET DIVERS IN THAT RIVER.

12:09.029 --> 12:12.766
- THIS BABY COULD BE OUT HERE.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.308
- 16 HOURS SINCE THE BABY
WAS REPORTED MISSING,

12:21.341 --> 12:22.442
NO LEADS.

12:22.475 --> 12:23.977
I'M NOT FEELING
A HAPPY ENDING.

12:24.011 --> 12:25.946
CSU COME UP WITH ANYTHING
IN THE CAR?

12:25.979 --> 12:28.916
- ASIDE FROM THE BROKEN WINDOW,
THERE'S NO SIGN OF FOUL PLAY.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.083
THERE'S NO BLOOD
IN THE BACK SEAT,

12:30.117 --> 12:32.052
NO BLOOD IN THE TRUNK.
- WHAT ABOUT PRINTS?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.320
- THERE'S NO HITS--
THE ONLY PRINTS

12:33.353 --> 12:34.922
ON THE STEERING WHEEL
WERE TIM'S.

12:34.955 --> 12:37.324
- OKAY, SO EITHER
THE CAR THIEF WORE GLOVES

12:37.357 --> 12:39.192
OR THIS DIDN'T GO DOWN
THE WAY THEY SAY.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.861
KEEP THEM TALKING.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.932
[door closes]

12:44.965 --> 12:46.800
- YOU HAVE SOME NEWS?

12:46.834 --> 12:48.869
- UH...

12:48.902 --> 12:50.403
POLICE FOUND YOUR CAR.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.840
- OH, WELL, THAT'S GOOD,
ISN'T IT?

12:52.873 --> 12:53.841
- YES AND NO.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.876
WE DIDN'T FIND NATE.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.078
- NOW YOU SAID...

12:58.111 --> 12:59.813
NATE WAS IN THE CAR SEAT.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.182
- THAT'S RIGHT--
STRAPPED IN.

13:02.215 --> 13:03.984
- MMM.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.218
- THAT'S A LONG RIDE--

13:05.252 --> 13:06.954
FROM BUFFALO TO NEW YORK--

13:06.987 --> 13:08.388
FOR A LITTLE GUY.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.823
- CARS PUT HIM TO SLEEP.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.459
- SO WHEN DID YOU DECIDE
TO MAKE THE TRIP?

13:12.492 --> 13:14.261
- LAST WEEK.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.463
TIM REALLY WANTED TO SEE
THE HALLOWEEN PARADE.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.933
- WELL, HOW ABOUT YOU?

13:19.967 --> 13:21.134
DID YOU WANT TO COME?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.236
- YEAH, OF COURSE.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.105
- BUT...

13:25.138 --> 13:27.074
- I HAD TO ASK
FOR TIME OFF FROM WORK.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.976
- AND WHERE DO YOU WORK?

13:29.009 --> 13:31.278
- FROM HOME--DEBT COLLECTION.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.379
IT'S NOT BAD.

13:32.412 --> 13:33.981
I GUESS I SOUND NICE
ON THE PHONE.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.983
I DON'T GET HUNG UP ON MUCH.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.921
- SO WHAT ABOUT TIM?

13:40.954 --> 13:42.322
DID HE HAVE A JOB?

13:42.355 --> 13:44.524
- CONSTRUCTION--
DAY LABOR.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.626
NOT A LOT LATELY.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.362
- TOUGH TIMES
CAN BE HARD ON A MAN.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.198
- EVERYONE'S OUT OF WORK
UP THERE.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.934
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

13:53.967 --> 13:58.005
- YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO SET TIM OFF.

13:58.038 --> 13:59.206
MY SISTER'S JUMPING OUT
OF HER SKIN

13:59.239 --> 14:00.974
HALF THE TIME.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.375
- IS SHE SCARED TO LEAVE HIM?

14:02.409 --> 14:03.410
- THEY DON'T LIVE TOGETHER.

14:03.443 --> 14:05.012
- HE'S STILL AT HIS MOM'S,

14:05.045 --> 14:06.379
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.514
SHE STAYS WITH ME.

14:07.547 --> 14:08.315
HE'S OVER A LOT.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.384
EATS MY FOOD
LIKE HE PAID FOR IT.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.221
- YOU EVER SEEN HIM
ABUSIVE TOWARD HIS SON?

14:14.254 --> 14:16.256
- NO...NOT WHEN I'M AROUND.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.858
- THEN WHY'D YOU CALL
THE COPS ON HIM?

14:19.692 --> 14:21.995
- GOING TO TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:22.029 --> 14:25.966
- TIM HAD BEEN POUNDING 40s,
MAKING CRAZY ACCUSATIONS

14:25.999 --> 14:28.335
THAT SHE WAS SNEAKING
OUT ON HIM.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.071
HE TWISTED HER ARM SO BAD
IT WAS PURPLE FOR A WEEK.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.505
- ALLIE DIDN'T WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES?

14:32.539 --> 14:34.942
- HE'S IN HER BLIND SPOT.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.110
SHE WANTED TO NAME THE BABY TY,

14:37.144 --> 14:38.645
BUT HE WANTED NATHAN--

14:38.678 --> 14:40.981
FOR NATHAN GERBY.

14:42.149 --> 14:45.552
- HE LEADS THE SABRES
IN PENALTY MINUTES.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.022
- IS IT OKAY IF WE LOOK
IN NATE'S BEDROOM?

14:49.056 --> 14:52.926
- HE SLEEPS WITH ALLIE.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.298
- WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW NATE?

14:58.331 --> 15:00.400
- SUNDAY, RIGHT BEFORE
THEY LEFT.

15:00.433 --> 15:02.402
- AND WHAT TIME
WAS THAT AGAIN?

15:02.435 --> 15:05.939
- UM, THEY...
GOT A LATE START.

15:05.973 --> 15:09.676
THE CAR NEEDED A NEW FAN BELT--
ABOUT 4:00.

15:09.709 --> 15:12.345
- AND YOU ACTUALLY SAW THEM
PUT NATE IN THE CAR?

15:12.379 --> 15:15.615
- YEP, SUCKING
ON HIS TOY KEYS,

15:15.648 --> 15:17.684
HOLDING HIS DINOSAUR.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.421
YOU'RE GOING
TO FIND HIM, RIGHT?

15:21.454 --> 15:24.391
YOU HEAR ABOUT PEOPLE
GETTING CARJACKED

15:24.424 --> 15:25.959
WITH THE BABY IN THE BACK.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.427
THE BABY'S ALWAYS FINE.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.532
- WHEN ARE YOU
GOING TO FIND MY SON?

15:32.565 --> 15:34.134
WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING
THAT WE CAN.

15:34.167 --> 15:35.368
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I HAVE

15:35.402 --> 15:37.304
TO STAY HERE
AND ANSWER QUESTIONS.

15:37.337 --> 15:39.639
- BECAUSE ANYTHING THAT YOU
REMEMBER MAY HELP US.

15:39.672 --> 15:40.707
- I WASN'T EVEN THERE!

15:40.740 --> 15:41.908
- I UNDERSTAND THAT, TIM.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.643
I KNOW THAT YOU WERE MEETING
ABOUT THE CRAIGSLIST RENTAL.

15:43.676 --> 15:46.113
- DID YOU TALK TO THE GUY?
- WE DID.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.747
- I'M NOT LYING ABOUT THAT.

15:47.780 --> 15:51.651
- I UNDERSTAND HOW--
HOW STRESSFUL THIS IS,

15:51.684 --> 15:52.986
AND HOW PAINFUL THIS IS,

15:53.020 --> 15:54.287
HOW ANGRY YOU ARE--

15:54.321 --> 15:56.356
- YEAH? DO YOU KNOW WHY?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.225
BECAUSE I WASN'T THERE.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.394
I WASN'T THERE
TO PROTECT MY BOY.

16:01.428 --> 16:04.297
[sighs, voice vibrates]
AW, I SCREWED UP.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.299
I SCREWED IT UP.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.101
- IT'S OKAY, TIM,
IT'S OKAY.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.004
- NO, IT'S NOT.

16:11.038 --> 16:13.573
YOU DON'T THINK SO,
AND SHE DOESN'T THINK SO.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.708
- SHE? ALLIE?

16:17.277 --> 16:19.246
YOU THINK ALLIE'S
GOING TO BLAME YOU

16:19.279 --> 16:20.247
BECAUSE YOUR BABY'S MISSING?

16:20.280 --> 16:22.049
- SHE'LL FIND A WAY.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.156
- I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

16:31.591 --> 16:32.792
- WHAT DO YOU GOT THERE?

16:32.825 --> 16:34.994
- I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:36.263 --> 16:37.697
- MR. HERNANDEZ SAYS

16:37.730 --> 16:40.133
HE JUST BOUGHT THE CAR SEAT

16:40.167 --> 16:42.169
FROM A PEDDLER
IN TOMPKINS SQUARE.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.570
HE BROUGHT IT HOME,

16:43.603 --> 16:45.505
HIS WIFE RECOGNIZED IT
FROM THE NEWS.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.639
- SO CAN WE CONFIRM
THAT IT'S NATE'S?

16:46.673 --> 16:49.376
A MODEL NUMBER
OR REGISTRATION NUMBER?

16:49.409 --> 16:52.145
- IT DOES MATCH THEIR PHOTOS,
DOWN TO THE CLIP-ON TOY KEYS.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.381
CSU IS PROCESSING IT NOW.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.649
I HAVE UNIS CANVASSING THE PARK.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.551
YOU TAKE MR. HERNANDEZ

16:58.585 --> 17:01.020
AND FIND THAT PEDDLER.

17:04.724 --> 17:08.428
- HEY, GUYS.
WANNA BUY A RADIO?

17:08.461 --> 17:10.763
WHAT ABOUT SOME...
- THAT'S HIM, THAT'S HIM.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.532

17:14.834 --> 17:16.403
AND I GOT A PERMIT.

17:16.436 --> 17:21.541
AND I AIN'T DOING
ANYTHING ILLEGAL.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.777
- YEAH, WHERE'D YOU GET
ALL THIS STUFF?

17:24.811 --> 17:26.546
- I GOT SUPPLIERS.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.680
- WE'LL NEED THEIR NAMES.

17:27.714 --> 17:29.649
- THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL--

17:29.682 --> 17:31.251
TRADE SECRETS.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.852
- OKAY.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.287
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.555
[handcuffs clink]

17:35.588 --> 17:38.391
MR. COOGAN, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR LARCENY.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.294
- I'M A VIETNAM VET
JUST TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING.

17:41.328 --> 17:43.396
NYPD IS OUT OF CONTROL!

17:43.430 --> 17:45.598
WON'T LET A MAN MAKE A BUCK!

17:45.632 --> 17:49.569
- WE NEED TO PACK THIS UP.

17:49.602 --> 17:50.570
- I DIDN'T SEE ANY BABY.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.804
IF I DID, I WOULD HAVE RUN.

17:51.838 --> 17:53.406
I DON'T LIKE BABIES.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.507
- BUT YOU DID BREAK
INTO THE CAR.

17:54.541 --> 17:55.775
- I AIN'T ADMITTING
TO THAT EITHER.

17:55.808 --> 17:56.643
- WELL, YOUR PRINTS
ARE ALL OVER IT.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.680
- YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO LIE TO ME, RIGHT?

18:00.713 --> 18:03.150
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.651
BACK UP.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.686
YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE STOLEN GOODS.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.288
THIS IS ABOUT A BABY?

18:08.321 --> 18:11.124
- NOW YOU CAN TRUST ME
ON THAT, I SWEAR.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.125
- FINE.

18:12.159 --> 18:14.161
I BROKE THE WINDOW,

18:14.194 --> 18:16.829
TOOK THE STUFF.
NO BABY.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.566
- SO THE CAR WAS LOCKED.
- YEAH.

18:19.599 --> 18:20.567
NOBODY LEAVES THEIR CAR UNLOCKED

18:20.600 --> 18:21.734
WITH ALL THAT STUFF IN IT.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.470
- WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

18:23.503 --> 18:25.338
- JUST GETTING DARK.

18:25.372 --> 18:26.673
CRAZIES IN MASKS RUNNING AROUND.

18:26.706 --> 18:27.674
HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.343
GIVES ME POST-TRAUMATIC.

18:30.377 --> 18:33.146
I WANT MY LAWYER.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.148
- THIS GUY LAWYERS UP?

18:35.182 --> 18:36.583
- UH, HE DIDN'T TAKE THE KID.

18:36.616 --> 18:37.717
- WHERE ARE WE
WITH THE PARENTS?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.253
- WELL, SOMETHING HAPPENED
BETWEEN BUFFALO AND HERE,

18:40.287 --> 18:42.789
BUT I DON'T MAKE EITHER
OF THEM AS HARD-CORE CRIMINALS.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.391
THEY WOULD HAVE COME UP
WITH A BETTER STORY.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.792
- WELL, JUST KEEP THEM TALKING.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.560
WE STILL DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
PROBABLE CAUSE TO ARREST.

18:47.594 --> 18:49.162
- WELL, WE MIGHT NOW.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.398
PRELIM LABS CAME BACK ON
THE ITEMS TAKEN FROM THEIR CAR.

18:51.431 --> 18:52.865
- SOMETHING ON THE CAR SEAT?

18:52.899 --> 18:54.434
- WELL, THE COOLER.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.737
LAB FOUND FECAL MATTER
WITH TRACES OF SOY FORMULA.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.439
[turns page over]

18:59.472 --> 19:01.574
- THEY PUT THEIR BABY
IN THE COOLER?

19:03.376 --> 19:05.878
- THAT BABY'S BODY.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.444
[door clacks]

19:37.477 --> 19:39.279
- WHERE AM I?

19:39.312 --> 19:40.347
OH.

19:42.482 --> 19:43.750
OH.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.985
WHAT TIME IS IT?

19:46.018 --> 19:47.854
- IT'S 8:00 P.M.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.423
[coffee pot clanks]

19:50.457 --> 19:53.326
YOU ALL RIGHT, ALLIE?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.761
YOU WERE DREAMING?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.830
- YES.

19:57.864 --> 20:00.267
- YOU KNOW, I, UH...

20:00.300 --> 20:01.801
NEVER REMEMBER MY DREAMS.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.836
- I DO.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.806
- WELL, YOU REMEMBER

20:06.839 --> 20:11.811
WHAT YOU WERE
DREAMING ABOUT JUST NOW?

20:11.844 --> 20:15.348
- NO.

20:15.382 --> 20:16.983
YOU STILL HAVEN'T FOUND NATE.

20:17.016 --> 20:19.319
YOU WOULD HAVE SAID
RIGHT OUT IF YOU DID.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.324
HE'S DEAD, ISN'T HE?

20:24.357 --> 20:26.626
- IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK?

20:26.659 --> 20:29.896
- YOU WOULD HAVE
FOUND HIM BY NOW.

20:36.336 --> 20:39.439
- LET'S GO BACK
TO SUNDAY--

20:39.472 --> 20:40.573
THE DAY YOU LEFT BUFFALO.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.709
- WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.976
- WELL, MAYBE SOMEBODY
FOLLOWED YOU,

20:44.010 --> 20:44.977
KNEW YOU WERE LEAVING.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.713
SOMETIMES THE SMALLEST DETAIL

20:46.746 --> 20:51.418
MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE, OKAY?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.853
- YEAH--
THOSE ARE OUR SUITCASES.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.722
WHEN CAN I SEE ALLIE?

20:55.755 --> 21:00.360
- YOU KNOW, DETECTIVE AMARO
SAID THAT SHE'S SLEEPING, AND...

21:00.393 --> 21:02.562
SHE PROBABLY NEEDS IT.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.732
IS THIS YOUR SON'S CAR SEAT?

21:05.765 --> 21:07.834
- YES.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.569
- YEAH?
[papers rustle]

21:09.602 --> 21:12.539
- DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS?

21:20.747 --> 21:22.715
IS THAT YOUR COOLER, TIM?

21:22.749 --> 21:26.586
- THOSE COOLERS,
THEY ALL LOOK ALIKE.

21:26.619 --> 21:29.489
- YEAH, SOME OF THEM DO.

21:29.522 --> 21:32.359
- YEAH, SO HOW DO YOU KNOW
THAT ONE'S EVEN OURS?

21:32.392 --> 21:36.796
- BECAUSE THIS ONE HAS
YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON IT.

21:38.465 --> 21:42.735
- WELL, THEN, THERE YOU GO.
- YEAH, YEAH.

21:42.769 --> 21:46.439
THE LAB FOUND
SOMETHING ELSE INSIDE.

21:46.473 --> 21:47.840
FOUND FECAL MATTER,

21:47.874 --> 21:50.577
AND TRACES OF SOY FORMULA,
JUST LIKE NATE DRINKS.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.746
DO YOU...WANT
TO EXPLAIN THAT TO ME?

21:53.780 --> 21:57.016
- I DON'T KNOW.

21:57.049 --> 22:00.119
UH, NATE'S A HANDFUL.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.690
MAYBE...ALLIE WAS BUSY--
SHE PUT A DIAPER IN THERE.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.659
NO MOTHER PUTS DIRTY DIAPERS
IN A COOLER.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.932
SO YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES, TIM.

22:17.136 --> 22:19.439
THE GOOD OUTCOME WOULD BE...

22:19.472 --> 22:22.875
THAT WE FIND OUT THAT THIS
IS AN ACCIDENT.

22:22.909 --> 22:24.844
AND THAT THE BABY FELL
AND HIT HIS HEAD.

22:24.877 --> 22:27.880
- NO.
- AND THE BAD OUTCOME WOULD BE

22:27.914 --> 22:28.881
THAT YOU LOST YOUR TEMPER,

22:28.915 --> 22:30.717
AND MAYBE SHOOK NATE.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.452
- THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED.
- THEN TELL ME

22:32.485 --> 22:33.886
WHAT DID HAPPEN.

22:33.920 --> 22:36.623
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THAT BABY
WASN'T TAKEN FROM--

22:36.656 --> 22:38.958
- DON'T YOU ATTACK ME!

22:41.060 --> 22:43.930
[sighs]

22:47.600 --> 22:49.869
- I'M SORRY.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.007
- THAT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.913
HOW DID NATE...

23:00.947 --> 23:04.751
END UP IN THE COOLER?

23:13.926 --> 23:17.163
TIM'S OVERLOADED--
SHUT DOWN.

23:17.196 --> 23:18.765
AMARO GETTING ANYWHERE?

23:18.798 --> 23:22.469
- THEY HAVEN'T
LEFT BUFFALO YET.

23:22.502 --> 23:26.873
- DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT TIME YOU GOT UP?

23:26.906 --> 23:29.742
- NATE WOKE ME UP.
5:00 A.M.

23:29.776 --> 23:32.979
- MM.
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.

23:33.012 --> 23:35.615
BEING TIRED
ALL THE TIME.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.750
- IF I COULD JUST SLEEP.

23:37.784 --> 23:40.587
TIM, HE TAKES PILLS SOMETIMES,
BUT I'M AFRAID TO--

23:40.620 --> 23:43.623
THAT I WON'T HEAR NATE.

23:43.656 --> 23:47.860
- WELL, YOU'RE
A GOOD MOM.

23:47.894 --> 23:52.064
SO YOU'RE UP AT 5:00.
THEN WHAT HAPPENS?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.000
- I GAVE NATE HIS BOTTLE.

23:54.033 --> 23:56.669
JUST HIM AND ME
IN THE KITCHEN.

23:56.703 --> 23:59.171
IT WAS SO QUIET.

23:59.205 --> 24:00.907
- NATE GETS FED.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.610
THEN WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?

24:03.643 --> 24:06.646
- COFFEE.

24:06.679 --> 24:09.749
- JUST COFFEE?
- YEAH, INSTANT.

24:09.782 --> 24:14.120
- YOU GOTTA TAKE BETTER CARE
OF YOURSELF, ALLIE.

24:14.153 --> 24:16.022
NOT JUST WORRY ABOUT
HOW EVERYONE ELSE

24:16.055 --> 24:20.226
IS DOING ALL THE TIME.
OKAY?

24:22.529 --> 24:25.732
ALL RIGHT,
SO THE FAN BELT'S FIXED.

24:25.765 --> 24:28.000
THEN YOU LEAVE YOUR SISTER'S
ON SUNDAY,

24:28.034 --> 24:29.068
AT AROUND 4:00?

24:29.101 --> 24:31.871
- YEAH.

24:31.904 --> 24:34.040
- BUT...

24:34.073 --> 24:37.544
YOU DON'T GET INTO NEW YORK
TILL MONDAY AFTERNOON.

24:41.113 --> 24:43.616
- TIM WAS TOO TIRED TO DRIVE.

24:43.650 --> 24:45.084
SO WE SLEPT AT A REST STOP.

24:45.117 --> 24:46.686
- STOP IT, ALLIE.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.755
- WHAT?

24:48.788 --> 24:52.058
- SO FAR, YOU'VE BEEN
TELLING THE TRUTH--

24:52.091 --> 24:53.993
HAVING BREAKFAST WITH NATE,
THE LATE START.

24:54.026 --> 24:56.162
BUT THIS THING
WITH SLEEPING IN THE CAR,

24:56.195 --> 24:58.197
THAT'S A LIE.

24:58.230 --> 24:59.899
- NO, IT'S NOT.
- ALLIE...

24:59.932 --> 25:02.068
STOP.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.641
ALLIE?

25:14.647 --> 25:16.015
- WE HAD TO SLEEP AT A MOTEL,

25:16.048 --> 25:19.619
THE BINGHAMTON MOTOR LODGE.

25:19.652 --> 25:22.521
- TIM DIDN'T WANT
MY SISTER TO KNOW.

25:26.659 --> 25:29.295
- SO THAT'S THE FIRST LIE.

25:29.328 --> 25:31.631
FIN, WHERE ARE YOU?

25:31.664 --> 25:35.267
- YEAH, THEY CHECKED IN LATE,

25:35.301 --> 25:36.335
WENT STRAIGHT TO THE BAR--

25:36.368 --> 25:38.037
WELL, OUR BAR AREA.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.139
WILD TURKEY, ROCKS,
AND COORS LIGHT.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.041
THEY GOT PRETTY HAMMERED.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.643
THEY HAVE A BABY WITH THEM?

25:43.676 --> 25:45.277
- WE DON'T LET MINORS IN HERE.

25:45.311 --> 25:47.614
- LISTEN, THEY SAY THEIR BABY
WAS SNATCHED IN NEW YORK CITY.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.782
I'M NOT HERE TO BUST YOU
FOR YOUR LIQUOR LICENSE.

25:49.816 --> 25:51.350
- DID YOU SEE HIM?

25:51.383 --> 25:53.019
- YEAH.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.654
HE WAS IN A CAR SEAT
THE WHOLE TIME.

25:54.687 --> 25:56.155
UNDER THE TABLE.

25:56.188 --> 25:56.956
IT'S REALLY WRONG.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.091
- WERE THEY MISTREATING
THE BABY?

25:59.125 --> 26:00.627
- MORE LIKE FORGETTING
HE WAS EVEN THERE.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.294
THEY WERE LOUD--
ARGUING.

26:02.328 --> 26:03.763
- YOU REMEMBER ABOUT WHAT?

26:03.796 --> 26:05.632
- A HALLOWEEN COSTUME--

26:05.665 --> 26:07.066
SOME PUMPKIN THING.

26:07.099 --> 26:09.101
UH, GUY SAID NO KID OF HIS
WAS GOING TO WEAR THAT,

26:09.135 --> 26:10.670
SO HE THREW IT IN THE TRASH.

26:10.703 --> 26:12.304
- THEY LEFT HERE
WITH THE BABY?

26:12.338 --> 26:13.640
- YEAH.
- WHAT TIME?

26:13.673 --> 26:16.676
- UH, CLOSING TIME--4:00.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.279
- OKAY, ALLIE,
CAN YOU HAVE A SEAT?

26:20.312 --> 26:22.882
- TWO OF OUR DETECTIVES
ARE AT THE MOTEL RIGHT NOW.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.051
NOW YOU TOLD ME
YOU WENT RIGHT TO BED.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.620
BUT PEOPLE I.D.'D YOU,
AT THE BAR.

26:27.654 --> 26:28.921
WITH NATE.

26:32.258 --> 26:33.960
- WE HAD TO BRING HIM IN.

26:33.993 --> 26:37.063
THERE WAS NO ONE
TO WATCH HIM.

26:37.096 --> 26:40.332
- ALLIE, SHE LIES SOMETIMES.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.301
NOT ON PURPOSE,
SHE JUST LIKES

26:42.334 --> 26:45.037
TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT SHE THINKS
THEY WANT TO HEAR.

26:45.071 --> 26:48.107
- SO WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT THE MOTEL?

26:48.140 --> 26:51.778
YOU WERE DRINKING.

26:51.811 --> 26:54.213
- YEAH.
- SO WHATEVER HAPPENED, TIM,

26:54.246 --> 26:56.749
WASN'T YOUR FAULT--

26:56.783 --> 27:00.887
IT WAS THE ALCOHOL.

27:00.920 --> 27:05.057
I DON'T THINK
THAT YOU LEFT THE HOUSE

27:05.091 --> 27:07.660
INTENDING TO HURT YOUR SON.

27:07.694 --> 27:09.829
I THINK WHATEVER HAPPENED,

27:09.862 --> 27:12.799
IT WASN'T INTENTIONAL.

27:12.832 --> 27:16.669
- [sniffles]
I DIDN'T DO IT.

27:16.703 --> 27:18.337
- SO IT WAS ALLIE.

27:18.370 --> 27:20.773
- NO. SHE WOULD NEVER--

27:20.807 --> 27:22.308
- YOU TWO WERE ARGUING
AT THE BAR.

27:22.341 --> 27:25.812
MAYBE SHE GOT UPSET.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.214
- TIM WAS IN SUCH A BAD MOOD,
I THOUGHT,

27:28.247 --> 27:30.917
IF WE HAD A DRINK,
WE COULD MAYBE HAVE SOME FUN--

27:30.950 --> 27:32.351
BE ON VACATION.
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT HAPPENED?

27:32.384 --> 27:33.820
TIM GOT DRUNK?

27:33.853 --> 27:34.954
HE LOST HIS TEMPER WITH YOU?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.188
WITH NATE?
- NO.

27:36.222 --> 27:37.924
HE DOESN'T MEAN
THE THINGS HE DOES!

27:37.957 --> 27:39.225
- YOU TRIED TO STOP HIM,
BUT YOU COULDN'T HELP NATE.

27:39.258 --> 27:40.326
NOW YOU CAN!

27:40.359 --> 27:41.894
YOU'RE NATE'S MOM, ALL RIGHT?

27:41.928 --> 27:43.062
YOU CAN HELP HIM NOW.

27:43.095 --> 27:46.065
- HOW?

27:46.098 --> 27:50.669
I JUST WANT TO GO BACK
AND MAKE IT NOT HAPPEN.

27:54.473 --> 27:56.308
I'M SORRY.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.278
I'M SO SORRY.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.719
- SHE'S, UM,
SMARTER THAN ME.

28:06.753 --> 28:08.354
SHE TALKS FASTER.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.790
SOMETIMES I JUST--
I NEED HER

28:10.823 --> 28:13.492
TO SHUT UP--SO I CAN--
ONE MINUTE.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.962
- YOU GOT ALL THIS
RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU.

28:15.995 --> 28:18.297
YOU'RE EXHAUSTED,
YOU'RE TIRED.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.066
AND SHE JUST WON'T
LEAVE YOU BE

28:20.099 --> 28:24.070
FOR ONE SECOND.

28:24.103 --> 28:27.106
- THAT STUPID COSTUME.

28:27.139 --> 28:30.342
WOULD YOU LET YOUR SON GO OUT
LOOKING LIKE A PUMPKIN?

28:30.376 --> 28:33.179
- YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.481
MAYBE YOU JUST
TOOK THAT OUT ON NATE.

28:35.514 --> 28:37.183
- NO.

28:37.216 --> 28:38.851
NATE WAS IN HIS CAR SEAT.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.086
THE CAR GOT STOLEN,

28:40.119 --> 28:42.121
LIKE ALLIE SAID.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.791
- TIM, YOU JUST SAID

28:44.824 --> 28:46.358
THAT ALLIE IS A LIAR.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.394
YOU CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.729
SO WHICH ONE IS IT?

28:54.166 --> 28:56.202
- WHEN IS THIS GUY
GOING TO GIVE IT UP?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.137
- LIV'S GETTING TO HIM--
HE'S GONNA GO.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.039
- OH, PLEASE TELL ME THEY'VE
BEEN MIRANDIZED.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.308
- EARLY ON.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.276
YOU GOT SOMETHING.

29:05.845 --> 29:10.149
SHE'S GOING TO DRAW A MAP
OF WHERE THEY BURIED THE BABY.

29:19.892 --> 29:23.329
- FOUND SOMETHING.

29:23.362 --> 29:28.034
- [sighs]
THIS NEVER GETS EASY.

29:31.270 --> 29:37.109
- OH.
- OH, LORD.

29:37.143 --> 29:40.779
- WITH HIS BLANKET
AND HIS TOY.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.487
- SHE DIDN'T WANT HIM
TO BE ALONE.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.002
- THIS BABY WAS CARED FOR,
HEALTHY,

30:03.035 --> 30:05.004
WELL-NOURISHED,
WELL-DEVELOPED,

30:05.037 --> 30:08.474
SIZE APPROPRIATE,
NO SIGNS OF ABUSE.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.210
THE WAY HE WAS BURIED--

30:11.243 --> 30:13.179
HE WAS LOVED.

30:15.414 --> 30:17.216
- SO HOW DID HE DIE?

30:17.249 --> 30:18.017
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.119
- COULD IT HAVE BEEN
AN ACCIDENT?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.220
- NO VISIBLE SIGNS OF TRAUMA.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.055
NOTHING IN THE THROAT OR LUNGS.

30:23.089 --> 30:24.857
NOTHING IN THE STOMACH CONTENTS.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.125
NO NEEDLE MARKS.

30:26.158 --> 30:29.628
WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT
FOR THE TOX SCREEN.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.397
IT WOULD HELP TO KNOW
WHERE HE DIED.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.066
- YEAH, WE'RE WORKING ON IT.

30:34.100 --> 30:35.101
THANKS, MELINDA.

30:42.508 --> 30:45.244
- YOU OKAY?

30:47.013 --> 30:48.948
- SO [clears throat]
WHATEVER HAPPENED,

30:48.981 --> 30:53.319
THEY EITHER DID IT TOGETHER,
OR SHE'S COVERING FOR HIM.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.288
- ALLIE AND TIM
AREN'T GOING ANYWHERE.

30:56.322 --> 30:57.289
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,

30:57.323 --> 30:59.892
GO HOME
AND HUG YOUR DAUGHTER.

30:59.926 --> 31:01.660
- UH, SHE'S
TAKING A NAP, SO...

31:01.693 --> 31:04.263
- YOU KNOW, AMARO, SVU...

31:04.296 --> 31:06.632
- YEAH, I KNOW.

31:06.665 --> 31:09.535
- I'M THE LAST PERSON
TO BE GIVING PARENTAL ADVICE.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.337
- NO, RIGHT NOW,

31:11.370 --> 31:15.174
THIS KID--
HE NEEDS US.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.513
- YOU FOUND HIM?

31:23.515 --> 31:26.252
- YEAH.

31:27.419 --> 31:29.989
- HOW WAS HE?
WAS HE OKAY?

31:30.022 --> 31:32.291
- ALLIE...

31:32.324 --> 31:35.561
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

31:35.594 --> 31:38.097
- I DIDN'T KILL MY SON.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.999
- SO YOU'RE SAYING ALLIE DID?

31:40.032 --> 31:43.635
- SHE WOULD NEVER. NO.

31:43.669 --> 31:47.139
- TIM, YOUR SON IS
ON AN AUTOPSY TABLE RIGHT NOW.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.210
TELL US HOW IT HAPPENED.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.479
- I DON'T KNOW.

31:53.512 --> 31:54.947
I DON'T KNOW.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.983
- IF YOU PLEAD GUILTY,

31:57.016 --> 31:58.684
AND SAY THAT ALLIE HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT,

31:58.717 --> 31:59.551
THEN SHE GOES FREE.

31:59.585 --> 32:04.090
NOW I KNOW THAT YOU WANT
TO PROTECT HER

32:04.123 --> 32:05.992
- I WANT TO TALK TO HER.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.995
- I'VE SEEN...
HOW TIM CAN BE,

32:09.028 --> 32:11.363
HOW HE LOSES CONTROL.

32:11.397 --> 32:14.366
- NO, YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT HIM.

32:14.400 --> 32:18.370
- OKAY, YOU WANT TO BE LOYAL,
WE GET THAT.

32:18.404 --> 32:19.972
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO
THE RIGHT THING.

32:20.006 --> 32:22.041
- NO.
- LOOK, ALLIE,

32:22.074 --> 32:23.675
YOU DREW ME THAT MAP.

32:23.709 --> 32:26.112
YOU WANTED US TO FIND NATE,

32:26.145 --> 32:27.513
YOU WANTED US TO KNOW.

32:27.546 --> 32:30.082
- I CAN'T.

32:30.116 --> 32:32.618
- YOU NEED TO MAKE A DECISION
RIGHT NOW.

32:32.651 --> 32:36.022
- MAYBE I SHOULD
CALL A LAWYER?

32:36.055 --> 32:38.757
- ALL A LAWYER'S GOING TO DO
IS TELL YOU TO STOP TALKING,

32:38.790 --> 32:40.626
AND LOOK OUT FOR YOURSELF.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.329
YOU'RE NOT THAT KIND OF MAN,
ARE YOU?

32:47.399 --> 32:53.105
- I ASKED ALLIE TO MARRY ME...

32:53.139 --> 32:55.241
WHEN SHE WAS PREGNANT.

32:55.274 --> 32:58.044
[sniffles]
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T WANT

32:58.077 --> 33:00.779
TO DO IT LIKE THAT,
LIKE I WAS, UH...

33:00.812 --> 33:03.115
COMPLICATED.

33:03.149 --> 33:05.117
BUT I DIDN'T FEEL THAT WAY.

33:05.151 --> 33:06.385
- I KNOW.

33:06.418 --> 33:10.222
YOU LOVE HER.

33:10.256 --> 33:14.693
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GOING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING NOW.

33:17.596 --> 33:20.766
THEN TELL US WHAT HAPPENED
IN THAT MOTEL ROOM.

33:20.799 --> 33:22.768
- [sobs]
I DIDN'T TAKE CARE OF HIM.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.636
- YES, YES, YOU DID.

33:24.670 --> 33:28.374
THE M.E. SAID
HE WAS LOVED AND CARED FOR.

33:28.407 --> 33:30.409
YOU WERE A GOOD MOTHER.

33:30.442 --> 33:31.543
YOU'RE STILL A GOOD MOTHER.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.512
YOU'RE GOING TO TELL US
WHAT TIM DID.

33:33.545 --> 33:36.282
AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT
FOR NATE.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.717
- HE WOULDN'T STOP CRYING.

33:38.750 --> 33:41.120
I JUST WANTED HIM
TO STOP CRYING

33:41.153 --> 33:42.754
SO I COULD CLOSE MY EYES.

33:44.190 --> 33:46.458
- SO WHAT DID YOU DO, TIM?

33:53.432 --> 33:56.502
- I PICKED HIM UP, AND...

33:56.535 --> 33:58.437
I SHOOK HIM.

33:58.470 --> 34:02.508
ALLIE WAS SCREAMING AT ME.

34:02.541 --> 34:06.478
BUT I KEPT SHAKING HIM...

34:07.846 --> 34:10.782
UNTIL HE STOPPED CRYING.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.518
- NO, IT WASN'T TIM.

34:12.551 --> 34:13.552
HE GETS BLAMED FOR EVERYTHING.

34:13.585 --> 34:17.389
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT.

34:17.423 --> 34:19.825
- WHOSE FAULT WAS IT?

34:26.432 --> 34:28.534
- I DID IT.

34:28.567 --> 34:32.771
IT WAS ME.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.112
NATE WAS CRYING.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.314
HE...

34:42.348 --> 34:45.251
I THOUGHT...

34:45.284 --> 34:47.519
IF I GAVE HIM A BATH
HE'D QUIET DOWN.

34:47.553 --> 34:50.556
I PUT HIM IN THE TUB...

34:52.424 --> 34:55.527
AND DOZED OFF.

34:55.561 --> 34:59.231
I WOKE UP--
NATE WAS UNDER WATER.

35:03.702 --> 35:08.707
[sobs]

35:17.183 --> 35:18.850
- THEY'RE STILL
PROTECTING EACH OTHER.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.187
- WARNER SAW NO SIGNS
OF TRAUMA.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.688
- YOU SAYING
THEY MADE THIS ALL UP?

35:22.721 --> 35:24.256
- YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK,

35:24.290 --> 35:25.257
WARNER SAID
NO WATER IN THE LUNGS,

35:25.291 --> 35:27.259
BUT THAT SEEMED REAL.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.427
- COULD BE PLAYING US--

35:28.460 --> 35:30.862
CREATE REASONABLE DOUBT.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.731
- THEY'RE NOT
THAT SOPHISTICATED.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.666
- IT'S FINE.
WE'VE GOT TWO CONFESSIONS,

35:34.700 --> 35:35.801
I'LL CHARGE THEM BOTH
FOR NOW,

35:35.834 --> 35:36.835
AND WE'LL LET A JURY DECIDE.

35:36.868 --> 35:37.936
- ON WHAT?

35:37.969 --> 35:39.438
THERE'S NO CAUSE OF DEATH YET.

35:39.471 --> 35:44.276
YOU WANT TO HELP?
LEAN ON THE M.E.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.711
- IF THAT'S WHAT
THE PARENTS TOLD YOU,

35:45.744 --> 35:46.945
THEY'RE BOTH LYING.

35:46.978 --> 35:49.281
THIS BABY WASN'T
DROPPED, SHAKEN,

35:49.315 --> 35:50.549
DROWNED, OR SMOTHERED.

35:50.582 --> 35:51.950
NOTHING ON THE TOX SCREEN.

35:51.983 --> 35:54.686
IT WASN'T MURDER
OR AN ACCIDENT.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.389
- SO HOW DID HE DIE?
- I NEED TO EXAMINE

35:57.423 --> 35:58.657
THE MOTEL ROOM, THE HOME.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.726
WE KNOW THIS BABY
WASN'T BREAST FED.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.428
IS THE MOTHER A SMOKER?

36:02.461 --> 36:04.530
- YEAH. WHY?

36:04.563 --> 36:05.664
RISK FACTOR FOR SIDS--

36:05.697 --> 36:07.533
SUDDEN INFANT DEATH SYNDROME.

36:07.566 --> 36:09.935
IT'LL TAKE A WHILE TO CONFIRM,

36:09.968 --> 36:12.704
BUT RIGHT NOW, THAT'S WHAT
MY GUT'S TELLING ME.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.679
- SO THEY EACH CONFESSED
TO KILLING NATE

36:20.712 --> 36:22.414
BECAUSE THEY LOVE EACH OTHER.

36:22.448 --> 36:23.949
ALLIE'S TRYING
TO SAVE TIM,

36:23.982 --> 36:27.419
AND TIM IS TRYING
TO PROTECT ALLIE.

36:27.453 --> 36:32.424
DO WE TELL THEM THAT THEIR BABY
DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES?

36:32.458 --> 36:34.826
- NO.
LOOK, M.E.'S NOT POSITIVE.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.895
THEY NEED TO TELL US
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

36:36.928 --> 36:40.799
TILL THEY DO,
WE'LL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE.

36:40.832 --> 36:43.835
- OKAY, I DIDN'T SHAKE HIM.

36:45.637 --> 36:50.709
THE TRUTH...

36:50.742 --> 36:54.946
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.449
I PASSED OUT.

36:57.483 --> 37:01.320
AND WHEN I WOKE UP...

37:01.353 --> 37:05.424
ALLIE WAS HOLDING NATE
ON THE BED.

37:05.457 --> 37:08.594
- NATE WAS FUSSY.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.597
HE WOULDN'T SETTLE.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.465
I WAS AFRAID HE'D WAKE TIM,

37:13.499 --> 37:15.901
SO I PUT HIM IN OUR BED.

37:15.934 --> 37:19.638
ON HIS BACK,
THE WAY YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO.

37:19.671 --> 37:20.806
I WAS CAREFUL.

37:20.839 --> 37:25.977
NO COVERS, NO PILLOWS.

37:27.513 --> 37:30.582
I WOKE UP--
NATE WASN'T BREATHING.

37:32.384 --> 37:34.820
- OKAY.

37:34.853 --> 37:37.456
THEN WHAT'D YOU DO?

37:37.489 --> 37:40.692
- SHE'S ROCKING HIM...

37:40.726 --> 37:43.962
SINGING TO HIM...

37:43.995 --> 37:47.466
YOU ARE MY SUNSHINE.

37:51.370 --> 37:55.441
I ASKED HER WHAT WAS WRONG,

37:55.474 --> 38:00.912
BUT SHE DIDN'T ANSWER ME.

38:00.946 --> 38:04.316
SHE JUST KEPT SINGING.

38:04.350 --> 38:07.686
- I TRIED TO GET HIM
TO WAKE UP--

38:07.719 --> 38:10.088
SINGING, STROKING HIS CHEEK.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.691
I TRIED TO BREATHE
INTO HIS MOUTH.

38:12.724 --> 38:15.827
- WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL FOR HELP?

38:15.861 --> 38:18.630
- WHO WOULD BELIEVE US?

38:33.412 --> 38:35.747
IT WAS MY IDEA.

38:40.085 --> 38:44.122
WE PUT NATE IN THE COOLER.

38:44.155 --> 38:48.026
WE DROVE TO NEW YORK.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.930
WE BURIED HIM.

39:02.674 --> 39:05.844
TIM LEFT THE CAR
UNDER THE BRIDGE.

39:05.877 --> 39:09.481
I TOLD THE POLICE
OUR BABY HAD BEEN TAKEN.

39:09.515 --> 39:11.149
EVERYBODY KNOWS
IN NEW YORK CITY,

39:11.182 --> 39:13.485
BAD THINGS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME.

39:18.490 --> 39:21.026
I DID IT.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.464
I MUST HAVE
ROLLED OVER ON HIM...

39:25.497 --> 39:29.868
OR SOMETHING.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.103
I KILLED HIM.

39:32.137 --> 39:33.572
I KILLED MY BABY.

39:33.605 --> 39:34.573
- NO. ALLIE...

39:34.606 --> 39:37.576
ALLIE...

39:37.609 --> 39:40.879
THE M.E. SAYS THAT NATE...

39:40.912 --> 39:41.980
DIED OF SIDS.

39:42.013 --> 39:44.850
- WHAT?

39:44.883 --> 39:46.485
- YEAH.

39:46.518 --> 39:49.621
SOMETIMES, BABIES...

39:51.790 --> 39:55.594
TH--THEY JUST DIE.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.863
- ARE YOU SURE?

39:57.896 --> 40:01.900
- YEAH.

40:07.573 --> 40:12.010
- THE THREE OF US
LYING IN BED TOGETHER...

40:12.043 --> 40:16.582
TIM SNORING...

40:16.615 --> 40:21.587
IT WASN'T PERFECT,
BUT IT WAS GOOD, YOU KNOW?

40:21.620 --> 40:23.689
I WAS HAPPY.

40:25.757 --> 40:29.495
AND THEN...

40:29.528 --> 40:32.063
WHY?

40:32.097 --> 40:33.899
WHY US?

40:35.233 --> 40:38.604
[sniffles]

40:38.637 --> 40:42.941
WHEN YOU WOKE ME UP BEFORE,

40:42.974 --> 40:46.478
I WAS DREAMING
THAT NATE WAS DEAD.

40:46.512 --> 40:47.613
THEN I WOKE UP.

40:47.646 --> 40:50.516
I THOUGHT IT WAS
JUST A NIGHTMARE--

40:50.549 --> 40:53.585
NATE WAS ASLEEP...

40:53.619 --> 40:56.154
EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

40:59.525 --> 41:01.627
AND THEN I REMEMBERED.

41:13.805 --> 41:16.642
CAN I TALK TO TIM NOW?

41:26.652 --> 41:28.520
[door opens]

41:36.161 --> 41:39.297
- NOW WHAT?

41:39.330 --> 41:42.634
- WE LET THEM GO.

41:42.668 --> 41:44.202
- REALLY?

41:44.235 --> 41:47.873
- AFTER WHAT THEY PUT
THE CITY THROUGH?

41:47.906 --> 41:49.140
- THEY'RE GONNA BE
PAYING FOR THIS

41:49.174 --> 41:52.277
FOR THE REST
OF THEIR LIVES.

41:52.310 --> 41:56.548
- JUST SEND THEM HOME.
