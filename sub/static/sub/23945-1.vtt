15:17.041 --> 15:20.294
I'm Chairman of the Board
of the Flint Police Foundation.

15:20.377 --> 15:24.298
This is a great day for Flint, a great day
for the people of the City of Flint,

15:24.381 --> 15:28.928
and I just want to say
that behind me is a new dog,

15:29.011 --> 15:32.389
provided generously
by the Sonitrol Corporation.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.350
His name is Sonitrol,

15:34.433 --> 15:37.770
and without further ado, I'm going
to turn this over to Chief Tolbert.

15:37.853 --> 15:42.232
Thanks, J.D. This dog is a tracking dog,
as well as a narcotics dog.

15:42.316 --> 15:45.778
So this is something that
the department desperately needs.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.029
We've lost that edge,

15:47.112 --> 15:50.658
and with this dog we're going to be able
to do a lot more things.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.912
[James] <i>We've got to find</i>
<i>innovative ways to do this.</i>

15:54.995 --> 15:57.122
<i>So we did it like the stadiums.</i>

15:57.206 --> 16:00.876
<i>Look, you put five, ten thousand dollars,</i>
<i>you can name the dog.</i>

16:01.669 --> 16:03.087
<i>Name is Sonitrol.</i>

16:03.170 --> 16:05.631
<i>You've got to find</i>
<i>innovative ways to do things,</i>

16:05.714 --> 16:07.091
<i>and it's not costing us a dime.</i>

16:07.549 --> 16:09.343
We're in a shit storm here,

16:09.426 --> 16:12.221

that my work speaks for itself.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.435
[officer] <i>You guys have</i>
<i>a tough job right now.</i>

16:19.019 --> 16:20.604

16:24.066 --> 16:25.109

16:25.192 --> 16:26.860
We're not getting guns.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.489
I did totals last night. We had five
felony arrests for the whole month.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.492
We don't catch people
on B and Es in progress anymore.

16:33.575 --> 16:36.412
That's one I've noticed for a long time.

16:37.162 --> 16:39.081
I appreciate everything you guys do.

16:39.164 --> 16:42.710
We have a tough job in a tough city
with low numbers.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.497

18:07.503 --> 18:09.713

-[Wayne] Anybody see what happened?
-[woman] No.

28:54.983 --> 28:59.028
-[Wayne] Where were you when it happened?
-They were all inside.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.614
-Inside where?
-They were in the house.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.992
-In here? OK.
-Yes, this is my house. -Do you guys know him?
-[mother] This is my son.

29:06.453 --> 29:08.997
OK, this is your boy? Who was he with?

29:09.080 --> 29:11.750
[mother] I don't know.
This is his girlfriend. Who was he with?

29:11.833 --> 29:15.962
-[man] Who was the last person...?
-Were you with him? You were in the house?

29:16.045 --> 29:18.631
OK, where...
You heard how many shots?

29:19.132 --> 29:20.884
[mother] Oh, my God!

29:21.676 --> 29:24.512
[officer] You guys have got to get back.
Let him work.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.265
[Wayne] Let's come up here. I need...

29:27.348 --> 29:30.518
Oh, my God, my son! Please save my son.

29:32.312 --> 29:34.773
He lost his father last December.

29:35.398 --> 29:37.525
[Wayne] They're going to do
everything they can.

29:37.609 --> 29:42.197
-[mother] He tried to move away but...
-They will do everything they can, OK?

29:43.156 --> 29:47.535
They're not working on him.
What's going on? You have to tell me.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.621
-No.
-[sobs] This isn't fucking...

29:50.497 --> 29:51.790
[mother] No, please.

29:51.873 --> 29:55.752
[Wayne] Listen, listen. Get your mom.
We need to preserve this whole area.

29:55.835 --> 29:59.589
I'll help you up.
We've got to save the scene.

29:59.672 --> 30:03.134
-[mother] Please. Please...
-[Wayne] Go up to the house.

30:03.218 --> 30:06.137
[wails] Oh, my God. No!

30:06.679 --> 30:08.139
Come up to the house.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.313
-[Wayne] Come with your mom.
-[mother] This isn't happening.

30:15.396 --> 30:17.398
[soft ambient music playing]

30:25.824 --> 30:29.786
[Wayne] You're looking over there at a kid
who looks younger than my eldest,

30:29.869 --> 30:33.540
who is 15,
and you wonder what can you do

30:33.623 --> 30:37.752
to prevent that happening
from your child any time in his life,

30:37.836 --> 30:39.629
especially when he's 15.

30:41.089 --> 30:44.300
But you can't take that stuff personal
or you couldn't do your job.

30:54.435 --> 30:56.771
[Bridgette] <i>It's not like working</i>
<i>anywhere else.</i>

30:56.855 --> 30:58.273
<i>I don't care what people say.</i>

31:04.612 --> 31:06.656
<i>My whole family has told me</i>
<i>I need to leave.</i>

31:10.702 --> 31:14.205
<i>I think they don't like it</i>
<i>because it's dangerous, and...</i>

31:16.374 --> 31:18.877
<i>they always think</i>
<i>the worst is gonna happen.</i>

31:22.130 --> 31:23.172
Not too bad.

31:26.551 --> 31:30.722
<i>I don't know if, working here,</i>
<i>if I could ever...</i>

31:31.598 --> 31:33.016
<i>have a family.</i>

31:35.476 --> 31:39.689
<i>It's not realistic,</i>
<i>which is sad to think about.</i>

31:50.658 --> 31:52.619
[woman] Colder than a mo-fo!

31:53.703 --> 31:56.623
[Robert] Yep. Just think,
six more months of this.

32:05.673 --> 32:08.843
[Robert] <i>Changing administrations</i>
<i>leaves everything up in the air.</i>

32:08.927 --> 32:10.720
<i>We don't know what's gonna happen.</i>

32:11.679 --> 32:14.807
<i>We've had people in the past</i>
<i>that have not done such a great job</i>

32:14.891 --> 32:17.727
<i>and it results in huge layoffs citywide.</i>

32:19.354 --> 32:21.022
<i>I've been laid off three times.</i>

32:21.105 --> 32:23.816
<i>There has never been</i>
<i>anything more stressful in my life.</i>

32:25.443 --> 32:28.947
The last time I was laid off,
people with 18 years got hit.

32:30.949 --> 32:35.495
It's like, how the fuck do you ever relax
and think, "Alright, I'm secure now"?

32:39.165 --> 32:41.125
<i>That's the reality of this city.</i>

32:41.668 --> 32:43.252
<i>You just never know.</i>

32:57.725 --> 33:03.481
[soft ambient music playing]

33:16.577 --> 33:22.000
[alarm clock beeping]

33:25.461 --> 33:27.672
-[Robert] You gonna get up?
-[Bridgette] Yeah.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.719
[Robert] You want to take this with you
or eat it here?

33:32.802 --> 33:34.095
[Bridgette] I'll eat it here.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.015
[Robert] It's really good.

33:37.598 --> 33:40.518
-Is it?
-Yeah. It's good with the blueberries.

33:41.728 --> 33:44.147
-Do you want a little bit?
-No.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.069
[Bridgette] Thank you.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.407
Do you want to...

33:55.616 --> 33:57.493
finish the Christmas lights tonight?

33:58.619 --> 34:00.872
The windows? Yeah.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.627
[laughter on TV]

34:07.962 --> 34:10.130
[Robert chuckles]

34:33.279 --> 34:37.449
[ominous music playing]

34:44.873 --> 34:47.710
[background chatter]

34:51.589 --> 34:54.257
I call this meeting of the City Council
to order.

34:55.051 --> 34:57.178
Roll call. Madam Clerk?

34:57.261 --> 34:59.931
[Eric] If I may, Mr. President.

35:00.640 --> 35:05.353
Let's get down to the business
which I believe people are here for.

35:05.436 --> 35:08.481
[loud cheering]

35:08.564 --> 35:09.941
[Eric] We'll call him up.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.777
Is Mr. Tim Johnson in the room?

35:12.860 --> 35:15.863
And if so, could he come up
to the microphone?

35:16.489 --> 35:19.325
[loud cheering]

35:20.576 --> 35:23.246
[man boos]

35:29.585 --> 35:32.880
I respect that Mayor Weaver
made a quote as saying,

35:32.964 --> 35:35.842
"My focus is moving
the city of Flint forward,"

35:36.217 --> 35:38.094
but to make this appointment

35:38.177 --> 35:41.973
will cause the city of Flint
Police Department to regress.

35:42.598 --> 35:45.143
[howls of disapproval]

35:47.645 --> 35:51.691
I will not accept
a lower standard qualified candidate

35:51.774 --> 35:53.734
than what we had before.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.695
[Jacqueline] And she basically said

35:56.445 --> 36:02.201
that she was replacing the Chief
with a fresh, new face.

36:02.285 --> 36:03.661
Fine.

36:04.412 --> 36:08.499
Three people that she's replacing,
those are recycled people.

36:09.458 --> 36:12.795
[Eric] I know him -
when he had two guns

36:12.879 --> 36:14.881
and he was pulling out murderers.

36:14.964 --> 36:17.592
I know him, coming up through the ranks,

36:17.675 --> 36:21.596
when he put his life on the line
with these officers

36:21.679 --> 36:25.141
in a high murder-rate community.

36:25.224 --> 36:27.852
The Council says he's volatile.

36:28.269 --> 36:32.231
Trust me, I'm gonna vote for him,
and I will sleep well tonight.

36:33.316 --> 36:36.611
[chairman] We're gonna cease the talking,
and now we're going into voting.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.905
Madam Clerk? Roll call.

36:38.988 --> 36:40.198
For Mr. Johnson?

36:41.908 --> 36:44.076
-[clerk] Miss Monroe?
-[Monroe] Yes.

36:45.077 --> 36:46.579
-[clerk] Mr. Davis?
-Yes.

36:47.997 --> 36:49.790
-[clerk] Mr. Winfrey?
-Yes.

36:50.124 --> 36:51.667
-[clerk] Ms. Galloway?
-No.

36:52.543 --> 36:54.545
-[clerk] Ms. Van Buren?
-No.

36:55.129 --> 36:56.672
[clerk] Mr. Kincaid?

36:59.133 --> 37:00.218
Yes.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.221
[huge cheer]

37:13.856 --> 37:18.694
[ominous music playing]

37:23.491 --> 37:26.744
[Tim] <i>I don't have a problem</i>
<i>fighting crime. I can do that in my sleep.</i>

37:28.829 --> 37:32.083
<i>My problem is, why did you tear</i>
<i>this department down the way you did?</i>

37:34.001 --> 37:35.795
<i>My goal for Flint Police right now</i>

37:35.878 --> 37:39.590
<i>is to restructure the department</i>
<i>and put it back the way it was.</i>

37:41.550 --> 37:45.805
<i>You have to have proactive units out there</i>
<i>going out looking for crime.</i>

37:46.347 --> 37:48.683
<i>The citizens have been</i>
<i>beat down long enough.</i>

37:48.766 --> 37:50.518
<i>We've got to be held accountable.</i>

37:51.060 --> 37:53.271
<i>That's the only way</i>
<i>this city's gonna survive.</i>

37:53.354 --> 37:55.690
