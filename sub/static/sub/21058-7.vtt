01:06.066 --> 01:09.527
VICINITY OF TAPACHULA
CHIAPAS, MEXICO

01:36.179 --> 01:38.139
They're approaching
the Talisman Bridge.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.580
They're here, sir.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.114
Welcome to Mexico.

02:51.087 --> 02:55.425
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:55.508 --> 02:59.762
I feel the fear,
sweat dripping away

02:59.846 --> 03:04.100
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:04.183 --> 03:09.272
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

03:11.274 --> 03:15.153
Even when the clouds drift away

03:15.236 --> 03:19.198
Even when my skin dries away

03:19.282 --> 03:23.286
I'll be back someday

03:24.287 --> 03:28.333
To unleash my return

03:32.337 --> 03:36.966
I have the dust
that protects the road

03:37.050 --> 03:41.346
I have the branches
of a leafless tree

03:41.429 --> 03:45.767
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:45.850 --> 03:51.522
There are silhouettes
that come to meet me

03:52.523 --> 03:56.110
Even when the clouds drift away

03:56.903 --> 04:00.156
Even when my skin dries away

04:00.990 --> 04:05.161
I'll be back someday

04:05.245 --> 04:09.832
To unleash my return

04:19.676 --> 04:21.094
Get him in.

04:30.186 --> 04:33.690
We're grateful for your invaluable help
and for your government's help.

04:33.773 --> 04:37.068
We'll contact you to coordinate
the payment of the reward.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.336
TAPACHULA AIRPORT
CHIAPAS, MEXICO

05:33.416 --> 05:36.252
MEXICO CITY, HEADQUARTERS
OF "EL GLOBAL" NEWSPAPER

05:41.758 --> 05:43.843
Why did you back out?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.596
Stop thinking about it. Forget it.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.805
I have the right to know the reason.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.018
The order came from above.

05:52.101 --> 05:55.229
Someone leaked your article
to someone really powerful.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.108
Who did you share your article with
outside this office?

06:00.068 --> 06:03.237
I'd like to ask you
for a personal favor before leaving.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.871
Now you know who is to blame
for all this, Saavedra.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.542
It's your own fault that your article
didn't get published.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.132
I know I can trust you, Conrado.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.760
I won't let you down, Mr. President.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.350
PRESIDENT'S OFFICE

06:45.238 --> 06:47.490
You'll now be my new advisor.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.120
You'll replace General Blanco

06:52.203 --> 06:54.247
and you'll coordinate our fight
against drug trafficking.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.920
Your first job will be to arrange
a press conference

07:01.003 --> 07:05.091
to introduce El Chapo
as the main drug lord in Mexico.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.307
And let's be clear...

07:14.350 --> 07:17.687
his detention is the result
of my government's actions

07:17.770 --> 07:19.605
in the fight against drug trafficking.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.002
GENERAL BLANCO

07:49.260 --> 07:51.429
This is Conrado Sol speaking.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.806
I need an official bulletin
to inform the media

07:53.890 --> 07:55.308
that El Chapo has been captured.

07:56.142 --> 07:59.979
There'll be a press conference today
in Almoloya Penitentiary.

08:01.397 --> 08:04.692
No, the General
is no longer in charge.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.487
From now on, I'm in charge.

08:24.170 --> 08:27.757
Look, tell your boss not to worry.

08:29.091 --> 08:34.722
I've alway smuggled more blow
than the Avendaños and El Chapo combined.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.016
El Chapo Guzmán won't be missed.

08:37.099 --> 08:38.476
All right.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.805
I need to speak with the General.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.659
Leave us alone.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.675
I want to negotiate.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.722
It's too late, Chapo.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.266
Nothing can save you from prison.

10:01.726 --> 10:05.730
I've got proof that the Deputy
Attorney General is on my payroll.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.817
I don't work
for the Deputy Attorney General.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.986
But you work for the President.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.449
How do you think his image
will be affected if people know

10:16.532 --> 10:21.245
that I paid Pozo $1 million
every two months?

10:21.329 --> 10:24.040
I paid him to protect
my drug shipments.

10:25.666 --> 10:28.294
The Deputy Attorney General
doesn't have a direct relationship

10:28.377 --> 10:29.462
with the President.

10:29.545 --> 10:31.631
You can say whatever you want.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.108
Larrazolo.

10:56.197 --> 10:58.616
A close friend of the President's brother.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.375
Consider that a direct relationship?

11:16.175 --> 11:20.137
Mr. President, we've got a problem.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.269
Be careful that Chapo doesn't open
his mouth until you get to the prison.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.522
I'll give you more instructions
once you get there.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.286
ALMOLOYA PENITENTIARY
MEXICO

12:00.928 --> 12:02.263
Yes, Mr. President.

12:02.346 --> 12:05.349
Don Sol, I have another
urgent task for you.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.701
TOLUCA AIRPORT
MEXICO

13:08.996 --> 13:10.039
Conrado Sol.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.416
-Nice to meet you, Mr.--
-This is a circus, Mr. Sol.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.418
Guzmán Loera
has not been through trial yet,

13:14.502 --> 13:16.879
and you want to leave him in this prison.
You can't break the law.

13:16.962 --> 13:17.963
DE TAVIRA
DIRECTOR OF ALMOLOYA PRISON

13:18.047 --> 13:20.799
This is your prison and you set
the rules in here, we know that.

13:21.675 --> 13:23.886
But Guzmán Loera
is no ordinary criminal.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.854
This is unacceptable,
however special he may be.

13:33.938 --> 13:36.148
The media cannot enter
a supermax prison--

13:36.232 --> 13:38.526
It's a presidential order, Director.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.404
So you'd better calm down

13:42.488 --> 13:45.074
and start preparing everything
for Guzmán's arrival.

15:13.329 --> 15:16.332
FEDERAL PENITENTIARY

15:38.062 --> 15:39.521
Bring them!

16:32.741 --> 16:33.993
Bring them in!

17:14.491 --> 17:15.617
Door!

17:39.933 --> 17:41.351
Unlock him.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.410
Change your clothes.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.996
I need to speak with General Blanco.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.581
Shut up and get changed.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.737
Is everything ready?

18:34.696 --> 18:36.698
The President wants to speak to you.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.372
Sir.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.291
I need you at
Los Pinos immediately.

18:46.375 --> 18:50.003
Yes, sir. I'll go as soon as
the press conference is over.

18:50.087 --> 18:52.589
No, I need you here now.

18:52.673 --> 18:54.758
Mr. Sol will take care
of the press conference.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.477
Thank you.

19:06.603 --> 19:08.230
Thank you.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.773
We'll begin in a minute.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.615
I need to speak to General Blanco.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.992
Move away from the bars.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.535
Please, call him.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.707
Open up.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.848
Please, leave us alone.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.524
I need to speak to your boss.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.360
General Blanco is no longer my boss.

19:58.822 --> 20:00.908
Now you'll have to negotiate with me.

20:00.991 --> 20:02.451
Son of a bitch.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.663
You certainly move faster than I do.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.332
Congratulations.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.834
I don't like to take orders either.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.421
That's why I think
we'll get along just fine.

20:30.145 --> 20:31.480
Listen up.

20:32.439 --> 20:34.191
You are not to say a word

20:34.274 --> 20:36.443
about what you told Blanco
in the airplane.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.820
Well, now you're talking.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.573
What do I get
in exchange for my silence?

20:43.700 --> 20:45.452
Your family.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.163
If you ever mention
one of those names,

20:48.956 --> 20:54.336
your two wives and your children
will suffer the consequences.

20:57.130 --> 20:58.632
And that's not all.

20:58.715 --> 21:01.677
In your statement
to the Public Prosecutor's Office,

21:01.760 --> 21:04.972
you'll make clear that the cardinal died
as a consequence of the crossfire

21:05.055 --> 21:06.556
between you and the Avendaños.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.561
I think you are the ones
that should be in prison.

21:12.980 --> 21:15.107
That's never going to happen.

21:16.316 --> 21:18.277
It's really simple, Chapo.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.739
You mess with us...

21:24.408 --> 21:26.743
and we mess with you
20 times worse.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.414
Don't push your luck.

21:40.048 --> 21:41.425
What's your name?

21:42.926 --> 21:44.511
Conrado.

21:45.429 --> 21:46.930
Listen, Conrado.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.933
I don't want to get in trouble.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.644
I don't want you to get in trouble.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.150
You'll lock me up in here
for the cardinal's death,

21:58.233 --> 22:00.360
and for whatever you want.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.280
But you know very well

22:03.363 --> 22:05.282
that it is better to have me as an ally...

22:06.325 --> 22:08.160
than to leave me here
and forget about me.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.457
Negotiations are done when both sides
have something to offer.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.835
In this case, you have nothing to give.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.837
Information is power.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.799
I'm sorry, Chapo.

22:23.842 --> 22:26.261
I don't think your information
is valuable enough

22:26.344 --> 22:28.221
to get you out of here.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.140
I know something that can destroy

22:30.223 --> 22:32.267
one of the President's worst enemies.

22:35.312 --> 22:38.690
I also like to stay up to date
on my country's politics.

22:50.994 --> 22:52.662
The only thing I can offer you...

22:53.830 --> 22:56.792
is to transfer you
from Almoloya to another prison.

22:57.501 --> 22:58.543
A friendlier prison.

23:00.837 --> 23:02.422
That's a start.

23:03.632 --> 23:04.800
All right, then.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.388
What do you know?

23:10.472 --> 23:12.307
Ernesto Rubio.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.536
The first candidate
of the opposing party

23:32.619 --> 23:33.995
to become governor in 60 years.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.080
GOVERNOR OF
BAJA CALIFORNIA

23:35.163 --> 23:39.167
As I said, that's a start.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.671
While Ernesto celebrated
together with his brother, Claudio,

23:42.754 --> 23:44.756
and his two great friends...

23:45.715 --> 23:47.884
businessman Fernando Gutiérrez,

23:47.968 --> 23:50.095
and Attorney General Pancho Lagos...

23:52.389 --> 23:54.975
Claudio and Fernando were already
planning for their future.

23:55.851 --> 24:00.564
They were planning a great business,
a top-notch shopping center.

24:01.398 --> 24:03.942
Both of them knew they'd need
an investor with lots of money

24:04.025 --> 24:05.402
to chip in on this huge project.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.363
Fernando said he knew
just the right person for that.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.915
Benjamín Avendaño.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.709
The one and only.

24:21.459 --> 24:25.088
They told Benjamín
that they needed $30 million.

24:37.392 --> 24:39.436
Claudio and Fernando promised him

24:39.519 --> 24:41.938
that the shopping center
would be finished in four months.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.316
But so much money in their hands...

24:45.442 --> 24:47.110
proved to be too tempting.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.339
The partners didn't know
that the Avendaños

25:07.422 --> 25:10.091
had a thousand eyes
watching their interests.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.302
They don't like when people
don't honor their word.

25:12.385 --> 25:14.596
And they dislike it even more if it's
their money being wasted.

25:42.832 --> 25:45.585
Benjamín promised Claudio
to spare his life if his brother,

25:45.669 --> 25:47.003
the governor of Baja California,

25:47.087 --> 25:49.506
gave them badges
from the Judiciary Police...

25:50.632 --> 25:53.343
badges to work without
having to worry.

26:07.440 --> 26:10.151
I'm sure Ramón used it to escape
from the cardinal's shooting.

26:14.072 --> 26:16.992
You're going to repeat all this
before the Attorney General.

26:17.075 --> 26:20.203
As long as you can guarantee me
you won't leave me here.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.414
Listen, you just have
to bring Rubio down.

26:22.497 --> 26:25.959
Confirm our version
of the cardinal's death,

26:26.042 --> 26:28.586
and do not say a word
about Pozo and Larrazolo.

26:29.587 --> 26:31.923
Do that, and I'll transfer you
to another prison.

26:35.677 --> 26:37.429
What should I say I do for a living?

26:45.854 --> 26:48.523
My name is Joaquín Guzmán Loera.

26:48.606 --> 26:51.860
I'm 36 years old and people
know me as "El Chapo."

26:52.610 --> 26:57.365
I'm married, I'm a Catholic,
and I'm a family man.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.785
I was born in Culiacán, Sinaloa.

27:01.619 --> 27:04.039
And I studied up to third grade.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.958
Everything that happened
during the shooting in the airport

27:07.042 --> 27:11.713
is just as what the PGR
said in the news.

27:13.506 --> 27:16.343
I don't know what happened
at the Christine nightclub.

27:16.426 --> 27:19.137
I heard about what happened in the news.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.934
-Ernesto Rubio?
-Yes, ma'am.

27:25.018 --> 27:27.771
Ernesto Rubio has business ties
with the Avendaños.

28:24.536 --> 28:25.912
Good afternoon.

28:33.169 --> 28:36.339
GENERAL BLANCO, THE PRESIDENT'S
RIGHT HAND AND UNPUNISHED CRIMINAL

28:36.423 --> 28:39.134
It was the gringos!
They threatened to reveal it.

28:39.217 --> 28:41.302
I don't care who leaked
the information.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.388
What matters here is that now
it's in the hands of a journalist.

28:43.471 --> 28:46.474
-Sir, I can guarantee you--
-You can't promise me a thing.

28:47.308 --> 28:49.978
You promised this wouldn't come out,
and now you see.

28:50.812 --> 28:54.941
I'll find the journalist,
and destroy the original article.

28:55.024 --> 28:57.569
You don't need to worry about it.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.488
No.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.908
It's too dangerous to have you around.

29:05.452 --> 29:08.163
As of now, you're no longer my advisor.

29:13.334 --> 29:15.503
GABRIELA SAAVEDRA

29:25.930 --> 29:30.393
How do you know I'll keep
being loyal to you, Mr. President?

29:35.398 --> 29:37.984
I'll send you to an embassy
far away from here.

29:39.068 --> 29:41.905
Your salary will remain unaltered.

29:47.911 --> 29:49.329
Excuse me.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.248
Blanco!

29:56.419 --> 29:58.254
Do not betray me.

29:59.255 --> 30:02.300
Or else I'll see that your trip
outside Mexico

30:02.383 --> 30:04.093
is a one-way ticket.

30:31.538 --> 30:34.749
Yes, it's me.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.796
I need some information.

31:04.988 --> 31:06.322
We're ready.

31:25.508 --> 31:27.719
Please...

32:08.885 --> 32:11.095
-What happened?
-Here, Guzmán!

32:14.599 --> 32:17.101
Where did all that money come from?

32:19.145 --> 32:20.730
What do you do for a living?

32:22.815 --> 32:24.651
What happened with the cardinal?

32:24.734 --> 32:26.986
In your statement, you say...

32:27.070 --> 32:28.738
What's your relationship
with the Avendaños?

32:29.447 --> 32:31.199
Is that your wife?

32:31.282 --> 32:32.492
What do you do for a living?

32:34.035 --> 32:35.203
I'm a farmer.

32:35.954 --> 32:37.413
What kind of farmer?

32:40.500 --> 32:43.378
I grow corn and beans.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.421
Are you a drug trafficker?

32:47.173 --> 32:48.716
Go play, honey.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.804
No, ma'am--

32:57.392 --> 32:59.268
Where does all
your money come from?

32:59.352 --> 33:01.938
Please, answer us.

33:02.021 --> 33:04.607
Please, answer us.
What were you doing in Guatemala?

33:04.691 --> 33:06.401
Where else have you worked?

33:06.484 --> 33:07.986
What?

33:08.069 --> 33:10.196
Did you have something
to do with the cardinal's death?

33:10.279 --> 33:11.572
No, sir.

33:11.656 --> 33:15.785
Take off your cap!

33:15.868 --> 33:18.496
Please, take off your cap.

33:18.579 --> 33:19.998
What are the guns for?

33:20.999 --> 33:23.001
No, sir, I've never used a gun.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.378
What's your relationship
with the Avendaños?

33:25.461 --> 33:27.714
Where does all your money come from?

33:27.797 --> 33:30.425
What's your relationship
with Amado Castillo?

33:30.508 --> 33:31.968
Is she your wife?

33:32.051 --> 33:34.262
Did you kill the cardinal, Chapo?

33:34.345 --> 33:37.098
Please, answer us.
What were you doing in Guatemala?

33:37.181 --> 33:39.058
Are you tied
to the cardinal's death?

33:39.142 --> 33:40.768
What were you doing in Guatemala?

33:40.852 --> 33:44.188
What's your relation with the Avendaños?
Please, tell us.

36:05.413 --> 36:07.248
Follow the line.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.604
Do not step outside the square.

36:31.689 --> 36:34.567
You've just entered

36:34.650 --> 36:39.405
Federal Penitentiary No.1, La Palma.

36:40.907 --> 36:44.452
You cannot speak directly
to the guards

36:44.535 --> 36:46.370
unless it's for an emergency.

36:47.246 --> 36:49.790
All insubordination will be punished.

36:49.874 --> 36:53.502
In here, all prisoners are equal.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.171
There are no privileges.

36:55.254 --> 36:59.217
Everyone who comes in here
leaves behind his past self.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.136
You'll only obey the authority.

37:02.220 --> 37:03.512
Understood?

37:06.224 --> 37:09.018
-Answer!
-Yes.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.937
Show more respect in your answer!

37:12.313 --> 37:13.648
Yes, sir.

37:13.731 --> 37:14.857
Lower your head.

37:16.984 --> 37:21.072
You are not to look into the eyes
of the guards, understood?

37:21.155 --> 37:22.573
Yes, sir.

37:23.324 --> 37:24.867
Take off your clothes.

38:26.929 --> 38:28.597
Thirty squats.

38:37.898 --> 38:40.067
Hurry up! We don't have all night!

39:08.763 --> 39:11.474
In here you'll learn
to love Mexico, son of a bitch.
