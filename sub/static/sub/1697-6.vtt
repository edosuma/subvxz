<i>You want some toast?</i>
<i>l'll bet you do</i>

00:49.574 --> 00:52.247
<i>Please add some jam and butter, too</i>

00:52.934 --> 00:55.607
<i>We're out of grape</i>
<i>So sad</i>

00:55.654 --> 00:58.168
<i>lt's all your fault, you bad dad</i>

00:59.854 --> 01:01.924
-You know what, Son?
-Yeah, Dad?

01:01.974 --> 01:03.646
You got nerve.

01:06.094 --> 01:11.168
There she is, six encores,
the voice that wouldn't stop.

01:11.614 --> 01:14.651
Well, they were just
such a great audience...

01:15.774 --> 01:18.607
They were such a great audience...

01:18.654 --> 01:22.090
-Well, this isn't good.
-Here, try some of this.

01:25.974 --> 01:29.205
<i>Life's what you make it</i>

01:30.334 --> 01:31.653
Help me.

01:37.614 --> 01:39.206
<i>come on!</i>

01:39.254 --> 01:42.405
<i>You get the limo out front</i>

01:43.254 --> 01:46.803
<i>Hottest styles, every shoe</i>
<i>every colour</i>

01:46.854 --> 01:50.529
<i>Yeah, when you're famous</i>
<i>it can be kind of fun</i>

01:50.574 --> 01:54.533
<i>lt's really you</i>
<i>but no one ever discovers</i>

01:55.654 --> 01:59.010
<i>Who would have thought</i>
<i>that a girl like me</i>

01:59.054 --> 02:04.526
<i>Would double as a superstar?</i>

02:04.574 --> 02:08.453
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:08.494 --> 02:10.371
<i>chill it out, take it slow</i>

02:10.413 --> 02:12.006
<i>Then you rock out the show</i>

02:12.054 --> 02:16.525
<i>You get the best of both worlds</i>

02:16.574 --> 02:18.053
<i>Mix it all together</i>

02:18.094 --> 02:21.245
<i>And you know that</i>
<i>it's the best of both worlds</i>

02:26.534 --> 02:31.688
Do, re, mi, fa, so not working.

02:32.534 --> 02:35.810
And it won't work if you keep talking.
You know, honey,

02:35.854 --> 02:39.130
this used to happen to me all the time
when l was out on tour.

02:39.174 --> 02:41.927
And the only thing that would help was
when your mama made me stop

02:41.974 --> 02:45.125
-and not talk for a while.
-l could do that.

02:45.174 --> 02:46.687
-Mile?
-What?

02:46.734 --> 02:49.487
-You're talking.
-Dang. Dang!

02:51.174 --> 02:53.404
There you go.
Now, listen, keep it like that,

02:53.454 --> 02:57.413
or we're gonna have to cancel
the big concert on Tv Saturday.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:09.854 --> 03:12.288
That's a girl.
Now, if you need to say anything

03:12.334 --> 03:14.325
for the next couple of days,
just use that.

03:14.374 --> 03:16.808
Hannah Montana has never
cancelled a concert before,

03:16.854 --> 03:21.644
and she's not about to start now.
l know that would just break your heart.

03:21.694 --> 03:25.084
And when your heart breaks, baby sis,
so does mine.

03:25.894 --> 03:29.603
''You got a hot date for the concert,
don't you, Jerkson?''

03:30.694 --> 03:32.685
-Dad.
-She wrote it.

03:33.294 --> 03:35.808
l can't believe you think that
l'm that selfish that l'd put my own...

03:35.854 --> 03:39.290
-What's her name, Son?
-Jenny. And she's a total babe.

03:39.814 --> 03:43.443
So put a cork in it, froggy.
l got a lot riding on this.

03:44.014 --> 03:45.652
Use the pad.

03:48.414 --> 03:51.008
Couldn't have said it better myself.

03:56.734 --> 03:58.213
Miley, l know you wanna get better,

03:58.254 --> 04:02.930
but sucking on those lollipops isn't
gonna do anything but rot your teeth.

04:12.654 --> 04:14.246
Miley, release.

04:17.254 --> 04:19.563
Fine. You leave me no choice.

04:20.053 --> 04:23.251
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.452
Wow, a week without talking.

04:30.494 --> 04:32.849
You know, that's gotta be tough
for a girl. Now guys, we're different.

04:32.894 --> 04:35.533
l don't need to talk. l can not talk
for a month, wouldn't bother me at all.

04:35.574 --> 04:37.929
But, girls. Talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.

04:37.974 --> 04:41.091
''Hey, Sally, nice capris.''
''l love your purse.''

04:41.614 --> 04:43.525
Now, that's just rude.

04:44.174 --> 04:47.291
Miley, l know this is gonna be hard,
but you just have to stop fighting it.

04:47.334 --> 04:48.892
And don't worry, we're gonna be
right here for you

04:48.934 --> 04:50.049
until you get your voice back.

04:50.094 --> 04:52.972
-Hey, Lilly, you wanna catch a few?
-Oh, yeah.

04:56.654 --> 04:57.973
Please.

04:59.934 --> 05:01.333
Thank you.

05:04.014 --> 05:05.845
You know, this is nice.

05:05.894 --> 05:09.409
Just sitting here enjoying the sun,
the beach, the fresh air.

05:09.454 --> 05:12.969
That's the thing about nature,
it is just so quiet and peaceful.

05:13.014 --> 05:16.927
Not like the constant noise you get
when you're in the city.

05:17.414 --> 05:21.407
Pull the vehicle over. Pull...
l know, it drives me crazy, too.

05:23.374 --> 05:24.853
-Hey, Oliver.
-What up, Dex?

05:24.894 --> 05:27.613
Hey, Miley. Feeling better? Great.

05:27.654 --> 05:29.804
So, maybe if you're not
busy Friday night

05:29.854 --> 05:32.322
we could go to the movies
or something.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.410
l got this one for you.

05:37.614 --> 05:40.208
ln your dreams, Poindexter.

05:42.214 --> 05:44.330
We're playing hard to get.

05:45.974 --> 05:49.284
Okay, what she meant was,
''Movies, shmovies.''

05:49.334 --> 05:51.973
You should plant one on her
right now, big boy.

05:52.014 --> 05:53.288
Will you make up your mind?

05:53.334 --> 05:56.565
You know, we're sending Dex
mixed signals. And he's...

05:56.814 --> 05:58.327
Maybe another time.

06:06.814 --> 06:09.009
''Four score and seven years ago''

06:09.054 --> 06:11.568
is the beginning
of what famous speech?

06:11.614 --> 06:14.845
Finger on my hand,
find the smartest in the land.

06:15.334 --> 06:18.246
Keep sliding, Oken, l can still see you.

06:19.534 --> 06:21.365
Miley, make me smiley.

06:22.294 --> 06:23.807
l got this one for you.

06:23.854 --> 06:27.051
Miley's answer
is the Bettysburg Address.

06:30.014 --> 06:33.086
l think she means
Betty Burg's address.

06:35.214 --> 06:36.966
Who's Betty Burg?

06:37.494 --> 06:40.292
What? The only other thing on here is
''l heart Dex,''

06:40.334 --> 06:43.485
and l'm not gonna say that
with him sitting right there.

06:55.094 --> 06:59.565
Okay, it'll be one week
in exactly three, two, one.

06:59.934 --> 07:01.162
Speak.

07:04.094 --> 07:07.291
Darling, l know you're scared.
But we gotta find out sooner or later.

07:07.334 --> 07:09.564
Dad's right, Miles. Miles?

07:10.494 --> 07:13.008
Great, now she can't hear either.

07:14.574 --> 07:18.487
You are falling apart just when Jenny
and l need you the most.

07:18.534 --> 07:20.889
-That is so like you.
-Would you shut it already?

07:20.934 --> 07:23.528
l'm nervous enough,
and l don't know if l can...

07:23.574 --> 07:25.087
l can talk.

07:26.094 --> 07:27.288
Yeah.

07:27.694 --> 07:30.686
lt's so good to hear your voice again.

07:30.734 --> 07:32.406
''l heart Dex''?

07:33.214 --> 07:35.250
The last thing you wanna do
is overwork it.

07:35.294 --> 07:37.285
''Betty Burg's address''?

07:38.454 --> 07:41.332
Man, did you make her look dumb.

07:42.614 --> 07:47.005
-''Plant one on her right now, big boy''?
-Like you weren't thinking it.

07:47.054 --> 07:50.683
Okay, now we know Miley can talk.
Let's see if Hannah can sing.

07:50.734 --> 07:55.683
<i>Don't let no small frustration</i>
<i>Ever bring you down</i>

07:55.734 --> 07:56.928
<i>No, no, no, no</i>

07:56.974 --> 08:02.412
<i>Just take a situation</i>
<i>And turn it all around</i>

08:03.734 --> 08:07.090
<i>With a new attitude</i>
<i>everything can change</i>

08:07.134 --> 08:10.285
<i>Make it how you want it to be</i>

08:10.334 --> 08:13.451
<i>Staying mad, why do that?</i>
<i>Give yourself a break</i>

08:13.494 --> 08:16.691
<i>Laugh about it and you'll see</i>

08:16.734 --> 08:19.453
<i>Life's what you make it</i>

08:19.494 --> 08:21.803
<i>So let's make it rock</i>

08:21.854 --> 08:23.128
<i>Make it rock, yeah</i>

08:23.174 --> 08:26.484
<i>Life's what you make it</i>
<i>So come on</i>

08:26.534 --> 08:29.606
-<i>come on</i>
-<i>come on, everybody now</i>

08:31.294 --> 08:33.933
Jenny, isn't the concert wonderful?

08:34.294 --> 08:36.808
What's that? You bad girl.

08:38.894 --> 08:41.772
<i>Life's what you make it</i>

08:41.813 --> 08:44.408
<i>So let's make it rock</i>

08:45.534 --> 08:48.287
<i>Life's what you make it</i>

08:48.334 --> 08:51.724
<i>So come on</i>
<i>come on</i>

08:57.134 --> 09:01.412
l'm sorry, Miley. This problem's
not going to go away on its own.

09:01.454 --> 09:05.811
lf you ever wanna sing again,
l'm afraid you're going to need surgery.

09:15.894 --> 09:17.293
Surgery?

09:18.494 --> 09:19.722
Really?

09:19.774 --> 09:23.130
Trust me, we're talking
about a very minor operation.

09:23.174 --> 09:25.324
l could do it blindfolded.

09:26.014 --> 09:28.812
l won't. l'm just saying that l could.

09:29.654 --> 09:32.805
Not that you'd know.
l mean, you'd be out cold.

09:33.094 --> 09:36.609
Doesn't that make you feel better?
lt doesn't, does it?

09:37.494 --> 09:39.405
l should stop now.

09:39.814 --> 09:41.247
You think?

09:41.814 --> 09:45.727
l'm sorry. l'm just trying to reassure you
that this surgery is no big deal.

09:45.774 --> 09:48.413
One hour in my office,
one week in recovery,

09:48.454 --> 09:50.843
-and you'll be as good as new, okay?
-Okay.

09:50.894 --> 09:53.169
Really, l mean,
the chances of anything going wrong

09:53.214 --> 09:56.365
and you permanently losing
your singing voice are one in a million.

09:56.414 --> 09:57.847
Oh, boy.

09:58.654 --> 10:01.851
One in a million?
Well, what if l'm that one?

10:01.894 --> 10:03.930
Doc, you were this close.

10:04.454 --> 10:08.413
Well, when l say one in a million,
it's just a figure of speech.

10:08.454 --> 10:11.287
l haven't done
anywhere near that many.

10:11.974 --> 10:15.330
Not that l haven't done a lot,
because l have.

10:15.374 --> 10:16.773
l'm going.

10:18.974 --> 10:21.204
Daddy, there was
a one in a million chance

10:21.254 --> 10:23.449
you'd be a rock star,
and that happened.

10:23.494 --> 10:25.371
There was a one in a million chance
l'd be a pop star,

10:25.414 --> 10:26.813
and that happened.

10:26.854 --> 10:30.005
Face it, this family's
one in a million central.

10:30.814 --> 10:33.009
Hey, Mile,
l really think you're overreacting.

10:33.054 --> 10:35.693
This guy's one of the best surgeons
in the country.

10:35.734 --> 10:37.565
Yeah, Dad's right.

10:38.534 --> 10:41.002
Besides, what do you think's
gonna happen?

10:41.054 --> 10:43.170
Just as the surgery's
about ready to start,

10:43.214 --> 10:47.810
a meteor hits a bus.
The bus drives into a hotdog stand,

10:47.854 --> 10:51.210
a giant neon wiener flies
into the power lines,

10:51.254 --> 10:54.132
the lights go off in the operating room,
and the next thing you know,

10:54.174 --> 10:56.404
you're spending the rest of your life
singing like Aunt Pearl

10:56.454 --> 10:59.366
after she swallowed that kazoo.
Remember?

11:02.614 --> 11:05.731
Oh, no. l'm never gonna be
Hannah Montana again

11:05.774 --> 11:07.969
all because of a giant wiener.

11:16.934 --> 11:20.324
<i>Here you go, Miley.</i>
<i>l want you to open this one next.</i>

11:25.414 --> 11:28.690
<i>Yes, just what l wanted.</i>
<i>Now l can be just like Daddy.</i>

11:28.734 --> 11:30.690
<i>Let's hear something.</i>

11:32.414 --> 11:34.644
<i>Rock, rock, rock</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

11:34.694 --> 11:39.245
<i>Rock, rock, rock</i>
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

11:39.294 --> 11:42.604
<i>l love you, Tennessee.</i>
<i>Good night. Drive careful.</i>

11:43.014 --> 11:44.413
<i>Did you hear that, babe?</i>

11:44.454 --> 11:47.127
<i>This little girl might just end up</i>
<i>giving you a run for your money.</i>

11:47.174 --> 11:50.246
<i>Well, maybe one day l might just</i>
<i>have to take you up on stage with me.</i>

11:50.294 --> 11:52.444
<i>Encore, encore, encore.</i>

11:54.254 --> 11:58.247
<i>Jingle bells, Jackson smells</i>
<i>from 1 5 miles away</i>

11:58.294 --> 12:01.923
-<i>l'm gonna get you, runt.</i>
-<i>Help!</i>

12:02.454 --> 12:04.729
<i>Hey, no running in the house.</i>

12:05.854 --> 12:07.924
-<i>He did it.</i>
-<i>She did it.</i>

12:07.974 --> 12:10.283
<i>Don't you just love christmas?</i>

12:11.694 --> 12:13.047
Hey, Mile.

12:13.774 --> 12:17.210
l made you a cup
of my famous loco hot cocoa

12:17.254 --> 12:20.326
with little marshmallows
so you don't choke-o.

12:20.854 --> 12:22.207
Choke-o.

12:22.654 --> 12:24.007
Choke-o.

12:24.254 --> 12:27.485
l'm gonna keep saying it
until you laugh. Choke-o.

12:27.534 --> 12:30.810
Daddy, what if something goes wrong
in the surgery,

12:30.854 --> 12:33.573
and l can't be
Hannah Montana any more?

12:33.934 --> 12:38.132
Well, then, l guess you'll just have
to pack your bags and get out.

12:39.774 --> 12:43.084
Baby, that's not gonna happen.
Everything's gonna be fine.

12:43.134 --> 12:45.728
The only thing you need to worry about
is what flavour ice cream

12:45.774 --> 12:47.969
you're gonna be scarfing down
after it's over.

12:48.014 --> 12:49.129
How do you know that?

12:49.174 --> 12:51.563
'Cause there's some things in life
a daddy just knows.

12:51.614 --> 12:54.367
Like, l know the sun's gonna come up
tomorrow morning.

12:54.414 --> 12:57.884
l know Uncle Earl's never gonna be
an underwear model.

12:58.574 --> 13:01.327
And l know your voice is gonna be fine.

13:02.294 --> 13:04.524
You get some rest now, bud.

13:04.574 --> 13:06.690
-Good night, Dad.
-Night.

13:09.854 --> 13:11.685
-Love you.
-Love you.

13:29.494 --> 13:30.688
Miley!

13:31.654 --> 13:34.248
Where is that useless freeloader?

13:35.934 --> 13:37.731
Right here, Daddy.

13:38.694 --> 13:41.811
l thought l told you to iron these socks.

13:41.854 --> 13:45.051
You know how l like a nice crease
in my hosiery.

13:46.254 --> 13:49.166
Sorry, Daddy,
l'm still cleaning the oven.

13:49.214 --> 13:52.889
Wait a minute, what's that
on the corner of your mouth?

13:54.374 --> 13:58.526
Have you been eating the burnt bits
off the broiler pan again?

13:59.014 --> 14:01.733
Sorry, Daddy. l'm just so hungry.

14:06.854 --> 14:09.573
Month-old trout skin, my favourite.

14:10.414 --> 14:13.724
Well, quit stuffing your face
and get to ironing.

14:14.494 --> 14:17.850
Just because that surgery
caused you to lose your singing voice

14:17.894 --> 14:20.408
doesn't mean you can lay around here
licking up trout drippings

14:20.454 --> 14:22.684
like the Queen of Sheba.

14:22.734 --> 14:26.204
But l can sing, Daddy.
l've been practising. Listen.

14:26.614 --> 14:32.928
<i>This is the life</i>

14:36.214 --> 14:39.251
Don't ever do that again.

14:40.934 --> 14:42.128
Okay.

14:43.014 --> 14:45.812
Now, there's only person
in this house that can sing,

14:45.854 --> 14:48.209
and we all know who that is.

14:48.534 --> 14:50.843
<i>Jingle bells, Miley smells</i>

14:50.894 --> 14:56.207
<i>from 50 miles away, yeah</i>

14:56.254 --> 14:58.449
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:58.494 --> 15:01.884
please welcome Bucky Kentucky.

15:01.934 --> 15:04.084
Thank you. Thank you.

15:05.214 --> 15:09.287
But Jackson could never sing.
And Bucky Kentucky?

15:09.334 --> 15:11.211
That's the dumbest name
l've ever heard.

15:11.254 --> 15:12.403
You're just jealous
'cause you don't have

15:12.454 --> 15:14.490
a state that rhymes
with your name any more,

15:14.534 --> 15:17.492
little miss nobody.

15:19.134 --> 15:22.809
Please, like anyone would
ever be a fan of Bucky Kentucky.

15:23.414 --> 15:26.690
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.
lt's Bucky Kentucky!

15:26.734 --> 15:31.330
-lt's Bucky Kentucky!
-Dude, dude, dude, dude, you rock!

15:31.374 --> 15:33.171
l love you!

15:34.414 --> 15:37.406
Guys, what are you doing?
lt's Jackson.

15:37.454 --> 15:39.046
-l'm sorry, did you hear something?
-Yeah.

15:39.094 --> 15:41.688
lt sounds like a washed-up pop star.

15:42.494 --> 15:45.964
Let's go kids, or we're gonna be late
for Bucky's big concert.

15:46.014 --> 15:49.609
-The limo's waiting.
-Last one in is a Miley.

15:51.734 --> 15:55.488
Guys, what about me?
l should be going to the concert, too.

15:56.374 --> 15:58.444
l was Hannah Montana once.

15:59.294 --> 16:02.843
Please don't treat me like this.
l have feelings.

16:03.494 --> 16:06.691
l'm not a piece of furniture. Guys.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.648
l'm not a piece of furniture.

16:11.774 --> 16:13.526
Okay, maybe l am.

16:14.614 --> 16:18.243
Hang on, kids. l've just gotta grab
my keys and my wallet.

16:18.294 --> 16:19.932
There they are.

16:20.854 --> 16:24.767
Daddy, what happened to me?
l'm nothing but a table.

16:25.854 --> 16:28.368
Honey, you're much more than that.

16:28.814 --> 16:30.850
You're also a coat rack.

16:31.974 --> 16:33.532
Sweet niblets.

16:34.174 --> 16:36.165
We'd love to take you
along with us, Mile,

16:36.214 --> 16:38.853
but you just got too many hang-ups.

16:40.254 --> 16:43.724
-Hey, that's a good one, Daddy.
-See, l told you l was funny.

16:44.654 --> 16:47.122
No, don't leave.

16:47.694 --> 16:50.845
Somebody help me. Please.

16:51.734 --> 16:55.204
Baby girl, you always did have
the strangest dreams.

16:55.254 --> 16:56.528
Mama?

16:58.334 --> 17:00.848
Mom, it is you.

17:03.334 --> 17:04.686
Sorry.

17:05.054 --> 17:07.010
Your daddy gave you
some of his loco hot cocoa

17:07.054 --> 17:10.933
before bed again, didn't he?
He knows what sugar does to you.

17:11.493 --> 17:14.566
l swear, when l'm finished here,
l'm popping in to one of his dreams.

17:14.614 --> 17:16.730
He is gonna get an earful.

17:18.334 --> 17:19.813
Not helping.

17:20.894 --> 17:22.247
lt's your dream, sweet pea.

17:22.294 --> 17:25.047
lf you don't like it,
all you have to do is change it.

17:25.094 --> 17:26.811
lt's not that easy.

17:27.934 --> 17:29.925
Hey, maybe it was.

17:31.214 --> 17:33.853
Where were you
when l was eating trout skin?

17:34.534 --> 17:37.048
All right, baby girl, we both know
you didn't dream me here

17:37.094 --> 17:41.326
to ask me that. Now why don't you
tell me what's really on your mind?

17:41.374 --> 17:43.205
l lost my voice.

17:44.174 --> 17:46.847
And if it doesn't come back, then...

17:48.494 --> 17:51.054
-Then...
-Miley, do you really think

17:51.094 --> 17:55.645
if you're not Hannah Montana, you're
no better than a piece of furniture?

17:57.094 --> 17:59.813
Look at that thing. l swear,
there is nothing more dangerous

17:59.854 --> 18:01.526
than your daddy
with a pocket full of cash

18:01.574 --> 18:04.327
and one of Uncle Earl's garage sales.

18:04.734 --> 18:07.806
Mom, if l can't sing, then l'm just...

18:09.894 --> 18:11.373
l'm just Miley.

18:12.134 --> 18:14.967
And what in the world
is wrong with that?

18:15.014 --> 18:18.006
l think just Miley is pretty darn terrific.

18:18.054 --> 18:21.012
And l know that she is strong enough
to handle anything.

18:21.054 --> 18:22.885
-She is?
-Heck, yeah.

18:22.934 --> 18:26.006
That's the way your daddy
and l raised you.

18:26.054 --> 18:29.603
You're a wonderful girl, and that's why
your friends love you so much.

18:29.654 --> 18:32.771
What friends?
You saw the way they treated me.

18:32.814 --> 18:35.851
For heaven's sake.
Lilly, Oliver, get in here.

18:38.214 --> 18:40.933
lf she wasn't Hannah Montana,
would you still be her friends?

18:40.974 --> 18:44.364
Are you kidding? Of course we would.

18:44.414 --> 18:45.642
Miley, you were my best friend

18:45.694 --> 18:48.447
way before l knew
you were Hannah Montana.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.849
Then why'd you all just walk out
on me?

18:50.894 --> 18:52.930
-lt's your dream.
-lt's your dream.

18:53.294 --> 18:54.773
And it was only scary

18:54.814 --> 18:57.567
because you're so worried
about that surgery tomorrow.

18:57.614 --> 19:01.527
lt's true, Miles.
ln real life, l sing like a starving walrus.

19:03.254 --> 19:06.246
Mom, this is where you say,
''No, you don't, honey.''

19:06.294 --> 19:09.570
No, you don't, honey.
Just a regular walrus.

19:10.014 --> 19:13.006
-A cute, tone-deaf walrus.
-Thanks.

19:13.454 --> 19:16.810
-l like your mom. She's funny.
-She's pretty, too.

19:17.574 --> 19:19.883
That's it. You're out of here.

19:20.294 --> 19:23.525
Hey, why am l leaving?
l don't wanna go. Stop!

19:23.894 --> 19:25.612
This is not fair!

19:26.414 --> 19:29.850
The point is, whether you're
Hannah Montana or just Miley,

19:29.894 --> 19:33.443
you're still gonna be the annoying,
obnoxious little sister.

19:33.494 --> 19:35.212
That l love.

19:40.774 --> 19:44.050
-Okay, you can wake up anytime now.
-l ain't done yet.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.484
You see, no matter what happens
to your voice,

19:46.534 --> 19:48.809
you have the most important thing
a person can have.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.130
-People who care about you.
-You're right, Mommy.

19:52.894 --> 19:54.293
You think?

19:55.694 --> 19:58.208
What the heck?
Oliver, get back in here.

19:58.254 --> 19:59.733
Thank you.

20:01.734 --> 20:03.884
You were loved
before you were Hannah Montana,

20:03.934 --> 20:05.492
and you'll be loved long after

20:05.534 --> 20:08.844
Hannah's on one of those
''Where Are They Now'' shows.

20:09.174 --> 20:11.847
l think you're confusing me with Dad.

20:12.894 --> 20:15.692
l am not worried about you one bit.

20:16.774 --> 20:21.131
-l miss your hugs, Mom.
-Baby girl, they're never far away.

20:22.134 --> 20:24.443
All you have to do is think about me.

20:24.494 --> 20:28.328
Now, listen, say goodbye
to your friends and get some sleep.

20:32.374 --> 20:34.330
You did good, honey.

20:34.374 --> 20:36.968
You're doing
a pretty good job yourself.

20:37.014 --> 20:39.528
Except for that hot chocolate
before bed.

20:39.574 --> 20:43.965
Yeah, about that. l know you always
told me not to do that,

20:44.014 --> 20:48.212
but this was a very emotional...
Miley, you can wake up now.

20:48.494 --> 20:51.008
Robby Ray, how many times
do l have to tell you?

20:51.054 --> 20:53.170
Miley, wakey, wakey.

20:53.414 --> 20:55.564
l cannot believe
you still have that table.

20:55.614 --> 20:58.333
No wonder
the girl's having nightmares.

20:58.534 --> 21:01.970
l'm sorry, darling.
You know l always was a pushover.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.692
That you were.

21:22.494 --> 21:27.727
<i>'cause it's you and me</i>

21:27.774 --> 21:30.368
<i>together</i>

21:30.414 --> 21:33.406
Don't be scared, baby girl.
The surgeon did a wonderful job.

21:33.454 --> 21:36.127
Your voice sounds better than ever.
Come on.

21:36.174 --> 21:42.409
<i>l'm always on your side</i>

21:43.534 --> 21:47.493
<i>No one, no one, no one</i>
<i>can ever change it</i>

21:47.534 --> 21:50.731
<i>come on, let 'em try</i>

21:50.774 --> 21:57.088
-<i>'cause it's you and me together now</i>
-<i>You and me together now</i>

21:57.134 --> 22:01.650
-Jackson, cut it out, boy.
-Hey, it's your dream.

22:02.854 --> 22:04.526
Not this time.

22:04.574 --> 22:08.726
Well, if it's not your dream,
and it's not mine, then whose is it?

22:09.094 --> 22:10.447
l think l know.

22:16.694 --> 22:19.447
Mama was right
about that hot chocolate.
