01:09.861 --> 01:14.230
Jd j

02:47.250 --> 02:48.853
What was your
Tom Brady story again?

02:48.877 --> 02:50.367
That he called me
the greatest person ever.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.744
Oh, 'cause
you're a fucking liar, dude.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.461
What?

02:53.465 --> 02:55.001
- Mm!
- Whoa, Derek, slow down.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.839
- Oh, baby. I'm on fire.
- Oh my god pull over,

02:56.843 --> 02:58.424
there's something seriously
going wrong with your...

02:58.428 --> 03:00.919
Don't you pretend
like you're not into this.

03:02.641 --> 03:04.177
No fucking way, man.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.015
On this week's episode
of "revisionist history"

03:06.019 --> 03:07.759
brought to you by
the grandmaster himself...

03:07.771 --> 03:09.261
I embellish, I don't revise.

03:09.272 --> 03:10.682
Bree, Bree, you better
get used to this,

03:10.691 --> 03:12.147
'cause when dating
my brother, here,

03:12.150 --> 03:13.936
he's got an alternative
sense of reality.

03:13.944 --> 03:16.356
He's also got this other thing,
I can never remember the name,

03:16.363 --> 03:17.899
- oh, here we go.
- It's... herpes!

03:17.906 --> 03:19.271
- No.
- That's right, it's herpes!

03:19.282 --> 03:21.022
Shut up.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.740
Yo, you're the one that
gets that thing every time.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.109
Wait, "alternative sense?
That's like "no sense."

03:24.121 --> 03:25.486
He still believes that
megyn Kelly

03:25.497 --> 03:26.987
was at our rush party
in second year.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.488
- But she was, guys.
- She wasn't!

03:28.500 --> 03:30.081
- She was!
- She wasn't!

03:30.085 --> 03:31.370
I had a whole
conversation with her.

03:31.378 --> 03:33.209
- Dude!
- She's a very nice woman.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.703
I'm the one that convinced her
to shift political views,

03:34.715 --> 03:36.330
- by the way.
- You are in denial.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.706
Yo, Jill.
Jill, you remember megyn, right?

03:37.718 --> 03:38.833
= Jill? Jill. All right, bbabe,

03:38.844 --> 03:40.084
- wait!
- I'm sorry, but we... we're to...

03:40.095 --> 03:41.460
We are in the wilderness!

03:41.471 --> 03:43.052
- We... please!
- Come on. Give it back.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.387
This is so fascinating. They're
calling me a liar back there,

03:44.391 --> 03:45.927
and I can't get a single word
out of you.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.515
"Stakeholder management.”

03:47.519 --> 03:49.350
This is... this is the eighth
edition of this

03:49.354 --> 03:51.436
fascinating document here.
It sounds riveting.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.146
Should we learn?

03:53.150 --> 03:54.356
- Yes.
- Alison? Learn!

03:55.110 --> 03:56.190
Alison.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.398
Guys, I need some knowledge.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.526
Read some, read some.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.323
Uh, okay.
"To classify and prioritize

04:04.327 --> 04:06.409
the value of a contributor
to said fund,"

04:06.413 --> 04:08.278
please, drop more knowledge.

04:08.290 --> 04:11.282
"One must evaluate
risk and reward against..."

04:11.293 --> 04:12.749
Hey Derek, I got a new idea.

04:12.753 --> 04:14.209
- Uh-huh? Huh?
- Roll down the window,

04:14.212 --> 04:15.577
just to get some fresh air
for a second.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.170
All right.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.789
- Where are we going with this?
- Here's my new plan.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.130
We find a bridge, we pull over,

04:20.135 --> 04:21.500
and we just Chuck Jill
right off.

04:21.511 --> 04:22.671
You... hey! Man!

04:22.679 --> 04:24.135
- Funny.
- This is my baby.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.879
- I got your back, babe.
- I know,

04:25.891 --> 04:27.301
but we've gotta save you
from this mind-numbing boredom.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.970
- Oh.
- We could throw the book out.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.638
- Well, okay. Okay.
- Don't you dare. Do not!

04:30.645 --> 04:32.636
Should we throw it out?
Yeah? Can we get a cheer going?

04:32.647 --> 04:35.889
Throw it out! Throw it out!

04:35.901 --> 04:37.812
No don't! Don't, come on!

04:37.819 --> 04:40.356
Hello everyone back here.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.853
Just a joke.

04:41.865 --> 04:43.465
Little jokey-joke.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.825
- Get that phone out of my face!
- Okay, relax.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.034
Relax?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.696
Didn't seem to mind being filmed
last time I checked.

04:50.707 --> 04:52.447
Don't...

04:59.841 --> 05:01.047
What is that?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.291
- Uh...
- Come on, man.

05:06.389 --> 05:08.505
What the fuck?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.935
Hi, officer. What's going on?

05:13.939 --> 05:15.645
Logging truck overturned
about a mile up.

05:16.066 --> 05:19.308
- Road's closed, I'm afraid.
- Closed? For how long?

05:20.070 --> 05:21.651
Few hours, I'm guessing.
Maybe more.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.607
Where ya heading?

05:23.615 --> 05:24.759
- Brook...
- Berkshire north.

05:24.783 --> 05:26.273
Berkshire north ski resort.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.716
And then you
have to loop around from there.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.368
Well, how far is that?

05:33.375 --> 05:34.911
50 miles, give or take.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.159
50 miles?! No fuckin' way, bro.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.915
Dude = bro?

05:40.423 --> 05:41.583
Sorry.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.047
I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep moving.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.507
Yep, ves, sir.

05:44.511 --> 05:46.502
Sure, thing, thank you.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.001
I gotta go. You?

06:17.252 --> 06:18.458
You want me to come with?

06:18.461 --> 06:19.871
- Yeah.
- Okay.

06:19.880 --> 06:21.280
Hello? What? No, I can't talk.

06:22.048 --> 06:24.755
Oh, uh...
Maybe not the best idea.

06:27.012 --> 06:29.549
Who the hell is she, anyway?
= Bree?

06:30.140 --> 06:31.880
Did you hear
what she said to me?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.349
Yeah, I'm sorry alli,
I didn't know she was coming.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.310
Thought I could escape it
for the weekend.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.013
- Look, I know this can't be...
- Easy?

06:41.151 --> 06:42.151
No.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.076
People just want to believe
whatever they need.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.150
- Will you wait for me?
- Yeah, of course.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.131
Hey, have you thought
any more about um...

07:07.844 --> 07:10.836
- You know.
- Yeah.

07:14.726 --> 07:16.341
If I continue with the charges,

07:16.353 --> 07:18.014
they can come after me
even worse.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.813
I'm not sure it's worth it.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.942
Yeah, I mean,
I'm sure that's a risk but...

07:28.073 --> 07:29.938
I feel like you'll regret it
if you don't.

07:34.329 --> 07:36.820
Besides, fuck 'em, right?

07:37.207 --> 07:39.323
What?

07:43.505 --> 07:45.041
Does your mom know
you talk like that?

07:45.590 --> 07:48.081
Oh, come on. I swear.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.341
Sometimes.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.972
I fucking love you, Jill.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.722
Blue 427?

08:39.727 --> 08:41.128
How's your shoulder feeling?

08:42.022 --> 08:43.852
It's fine,
it's still sore as hell.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.972
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:46.651 --> 08:50.064
Is uh... look man,
a couple of the guys are...

08:50.530 --> 08:53.112
Wondering if maybe, uh...

08:54.075 --> 08:55.315
Yeah? = uh...

08:56.036 --> 08:59.574
You were... embellishing?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.408
'Cause, I... I mean, like,
I don't think you were.

09:04.419 --> 09:05.909
I mean, why would you?

09:05.920 --> 09:07.560
- Right? It's just...
- Yeah, why would I?

09:10.216 --> 09:12.628
It's just, okay, man,
we could really use you

09:12.635 --> 09:14.876
if these suspensions hold up,
and you'd probably start, too.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.549
The guys...
They really want you to...

09:16.556 --> 09:17.836
The guys didn't want me to play?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.016
Is that what it is?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.970
All right, Phil,
what happened sucks.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.468
It does, but... = "but" what?

09:24.064 --> 09:26.897
Look, between you and me,
these guys are our friends

09:26.900 --> 09:30.188
and now their careers, their...
Their lives, could be ruined.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.685
For what?

09:31.696 --> 09:33.977
- We don't know what happened...
- They're not my friends.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.277
Phil, I'm sorry man I...

09:37.285 --> 09:38.285
Thank you.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.587
Hey.

09:51.341 --> 09:52.341
What's wrong?

09:54.177 --> 09:56.213
Your friends hate me.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.091
That's impossible.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.139
They just don't know you.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.025
What do you think she did?

10:12.904 --> 10:14.644
Copulated with the devil. = hmm.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.856
That or she spoiled last week's
episode of game of thrones.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.411
They're gonna love you.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.080
Okay.

10:27.961 --> 10:28.961
I'm taking this.

10:30.338 --> 10:31.794
Go. Go.

11:16.467 --> 11:17.467
Jill?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.298
= Jill?

11:19.929 --> 11:20.929
Shit.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.270
Help you with something?

11:34.944 --> 11:36.684
I, um...

11:36.696 --> 11:38.736
I thought that bears were
hibernating in the winter.

11:38.990 --> 11:39.990
Yeah?

11:41.159 --> 11:42.399
Well not that bear.

11:47.916 --> 11:50.373
Claw traps are
illegal in Massachusetts.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.706
What would you know about it?

11:55.673 --> 11:57.538
Well, I... I know it's
against the law,

11:57.550 --> 12:00.041
and I can... prove it. Just...

12:03.431 --> 12:04.796
So, do you know
anything about bears

12:04.807 --> 12:06.013
walking around out there
in the winter

12:06.017 --> 12:07.177
when they should be sleeping?

12:09.479 --> 12:10.844
Why don't you use that
little device

12:10.855 --> 12:12.391
that's glued to your hand there

12:12.398 --> 12:13.998
and look up
"bear attacks, western mass."

12:15.485 --> 12:17.441
- Service sucks.
- Yeah.

12:18.488 --> 12:19.819
Well, not for long.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.693
See the clear-cutting
that they're doing?

12:23.159 --> 12:25.070
Because of that
little computer there.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.406
Well, it's disrupting
the bears' habitat,

12:27.413 --> 12:28.528
messing with its rhythms.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.993
So the bear
thinks that it's spring

12:31.000 --> 12:32.285
and it comes out
looking for food

12:32.293 --> 12:33.499
but there is no food.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.704
So the men working in the trees,
they become the food.

12:39.342 --> 12:41.207
What, so that makes it okay
to just...

12:41.219 --> 12:42.709
A dead bear is a dead bear.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.170
It's better than a dead human.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.548
Well, you can do it in a more
humane way,

12:48.559 --> 12:49.639
it doesn't have to suffer.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.148
You haven't suffered
a day in your life.

13:03.157 --> 13:04.237
Have a nice day.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.695
Hey.

13:06.703 --> 13:08.193
What, does this
make you feel like a man,

13:08.204 --> 13:09.865
- hey, hey. Hey, hey!
- You can just

13:09.872 --> 13:11.578
- kill an innocent animal?
- Come on, come on, Jill.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.947
- Huh?
- Let's go, come on.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.165
- Get off Mel!
- Sorry, okay. Oh...

13:14.168 --> 13:15.328
What's wrong?

13:15.336 --> 13:16.246
I don't need you to...

13:16.254 --> 13:17.118
W-what? Need me to what?

13:17.130 --> 13:18.620
Step in like that!

13:18.631 --> 13:20.212
- Yeah, really.
- What's that supposed to mean?

13:20.216 --> 13:21.831
Jill?

13:21.843 --> 13:23.683
Jill!

13:24.053 --> 13:26.214
Jill?!

13:26.222 --> 13:28.679
Hey, hey. You're okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

13:28.683 --> 13:30.514
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?

13:30.518 --> 13:31.518
I'm sorry.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.731
Let's go, let's go.

13:42.530 --> 13:44.612
Okay.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.575
- You okay?
- I got the directions.

13:50.204 --> 13:51.944
So, what's the plan?

13:51.956 --> 13:54.743
Uh, according to this,
I figured out a quicker route.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.042
- A quicker route?
- That's what I said.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.661
All right, trust me.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.233
We've been coming up here
since we were kids.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.257
Right, Matty?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.218
Matty?

14:06.804 --> 14:08.340
Okay.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.804
- We're good.
- All right, yes!

14:09.807 --> 14:11.447
- All right! Let's do this!
- We are good.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.676
Let's see what this bass can do!

14:35.124 --> 14:38.036
What do you
call two jalapeifos having sex?

14:39.545 --> 14:41.001
Spicy.

14:53.893 --> 14:54.893
You okay?

14:57.647 --> 14:58.647
Yeah.

similar 'symptoms,"

15:49.365 --> 15:51.071
"sparking a ruthless witch hunt

15:51.409 --> 15:54.401
"that resulted in
12 women being convicted

15:54.412 --> 15:56.448
"and hung for witchcraft.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.118
Their anomalous behavior became
attributed to the land itself.”

16:02.753 --> 16:04.118
You're gonna
make a left up here.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.767
Tod, where's the road?

16:25.109 --> 16:26.440
This is it, right there.

16:27.278 --> 16:28.518
Really, this?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.232
Look, I know where I'm going,
all right, just trust me.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.428
Wait, I... I didn't sign up for
any of this off-roading shit.

16:34.452 --> 16:36.363
Jill, do you maybe have a tampon

16:36.370 --> 16:37.860
that you could
lend Philip back there,

16:37.872 --> 16:39.558
preferably one
that's made for a heavy flow?

16:39.582 --> 16:40.662
Gross.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.915
Look, there's a service road,
it's just up a bit,

16:43.920 --> 16:45.376
and then there is a hill,

16:45.379 --> 16:47.165
and that is our spot
right there, okay?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.586
Okay, this is a pretty loose
definition of "road."

16:51.052 --> 16:52.052
Mm-hmm.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.128
What are we waiting for?

16:55.556 --> 16:57.387
Yeah, how far
is that service road, bro?

16:57.391 --> 17:00.053
It's like a mile,
maybe two, okay?

17:00.061 --> 17:01.426
How far if we go back?

17:01.437 --> 17:02.552
We can't...

17:04.022 --> 17:06.103
That's really lame. That's
really, really lame, Jill.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.791
Are you sure
you know where you're going?

17:10.238 --> 17:11.728
We can turn back,
if you want to.

17:11.739 --> 17:13.730
Don't be such a pussy, dude.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.867
What about you, Alison?

17:16.243 --> 17:17.529
What do you wanna do?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.618
Would you rather drive back
two hours the way we came,

17:20.623 --> 17:23.455
or would you rather enjoy the
raw beauty of unbridled nature?

17:23.751 --> 17:24.751
Huh?

17:29.715 --> 17:30.750
We came all this way.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.668
Man, let's just turn back,
she's not gonna... okay?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.389
Gonna what?

17:41.310 --> 17:42.310
Let's go.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.562
Yeah?

17:44.814 --> 17:45.974
Yeah.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.522
Yeah, this is
gonna be fucking awesome!

17:51.237 --> 17:52.693
Nope.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.271
Yup!

17:55.283 --> 17:56.773
Oh, no!

18:01.247 --> 18:03.454
- Derek can drive!
- Let's do this!

18:03.457 --> 18:06.199
To the mountain we go!

18:15.803 --> 18:17.794
Severe weather alert

18:17.805 --> 18:19.761
over the western part
of Massachusetts.

18:19.765 --> 18:22.302
Forest authorities have closed
some highways and Bridges.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.551
Now, we may be
looking at up to a foot of snow

19:08.230 --> 19:10.596
Jd j

19:23.537 --> 19:25.323
Hmm, you decide.

19:25.831 --> 19:26.991
Ti can't choose.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.830
- How much longer?
- It's not long.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.082
All right, we've been driving
this road for well over an hour.

19:38.719 --> 19:39.719
Where are we?

19:40.179 --> 19:41.179
So close.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.635
Anybody have anything to eat?

20:02.159 --> 20:03.519
What?

20:04.829 --> 20:05.829
What, what?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.278
What did you just say to me?

20:09.583 --> 20:10.583
Nothing.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.328
What's going on, alli?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.755
Nothing.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.263
Tod, where the hell
are we going, man?

22:35.271 --> 22:37.057
We're going the
right way now, all right?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.850
- Tod, okay, tod.
- Just listen to me...

22:38.858 --> 22:40.723
Let... just shut up
for a second! Listen to me.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.440
I... I actually don't think you
know where the fuck we're going.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.025
- No, ju...
- Easy.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.439
Okay, dude,
if we don't see this road...

22:45.447 --> 22:47.187
- What's going on?
- We're lost.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.985
Go around this bend.

22:48.993 --> 22:50.779
That's the same path
we went down an hour ago.

22:50.786 --> 22:52.151
You've got to be kidding me.

22:52.162 --> 22:53.368
No, you're
not helping Phil, all right?

22:53.372 --> 22:55.454
Just... go right up there.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.288
This is fuckin®' unbelievable.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.285
There's gonna be a path and
then... there's gonna be a road!

23:00.296 --> 23:01.911
Shit.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.913
Okay, guys. Let's just go back.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.881
I think we are heading back.

23:07.094 --> 23:09.335
I'm telling you guys,
we're driving in circles.

23:09.346 --> 23:10.346
Trust me.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.088
All right, just take this right.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.279
This is the same path.

23:35.623 --> 23:37.830
You really have
no idea where we are, do you?

23:47.051 --> 23:48.916
Un-fucking-real, man!

23:49.970 --> 23:51.756
Fuck.
Does anybody have reception?

23:51.764 --> 23:52.924
= no. - Me neither.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.223
No.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.343
Got one.

23:55.351 --> 23:56.431
Okay, pull up your GPS.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.060
- Jill!
- She's right, man.

24:00.064 --> 24:01.304
You're not helping, Phil.

24:01.315 --> 24:02.875
Guys, can you both just shut up!

24:06.654 --> 24:07.939
Lost it.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.027
Check alli's phone.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.990
Let go!

24:12.993 --> 24:14.233
Whoa, whoa!

24:17.623 --> 24:18.908
Did I do that?

24:20.501 --> 24:22.913
- Jill, I'm so sorry.
- It's okay, it's okay.

24:23.921 --> 24:24.956
W... are you okay?

24:25.547 --> 24:27.128
It's okay. It's okay.

24:27.132 --> 24:28.212
I'm fine. It's okay.

24:28.592 --> 24:29.832
I'm so sorry.

24:38.185 --> 24:39.705
We shouldn't even be here.

24:42.523 --> 24:44.138
Derek, look out!

24:48.529 --> 24:49.529
Fuck!

24:54.368 --> 24:55.368
Everyone okay?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.120
Yeah.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.803
Yeah.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.770
- You stupid fucking idiot!
- You drove us off the road.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.772
"Oh, yeah,
I found a better way, trust me"?

25:35.617 --> 25:37.232
What're you, a fucking dumb-ass?!

25:37.244 --> 25:39.109
Chill, Derek,
it's not all tod's fault.

25:39.121 --> 25:40.531
All right, who's fault is it?!

25:40.539 --> 25:41.824
Maybe if you were watching
the road.

25:41.832 --> 25:43.697
What fucking road, man?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.300
We're gonna have to dig it out.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.309
Yeah... how bad is it?

26:12.154 --> 26:14.019
Well...
We're blocked, we gotta...

26:14.615 --> 26:16.276
- Fuckin' dig it out.
- Oh, it's not that bad.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.739
- I will.
- Okay, all right.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.404
I'll go get the snowboard
and I'll dig it out, okay?

26:19.411 --> 26:20.947
Let's just get this out of here,

26:20.954 --> 26:22.594
maybe we can get there
in time for a beer.

26:31.507 --> 26:32.747
We're not getting out of here.

26:36.053 --> 26:37.053
What?

26:39.056 --> 26:40.896
Hey, everybody out.
We're stuck, we gotta push.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.144
C'mon.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.358
Oh, yeah, sure dude.
Just use my board.

26:59.118 --> 27:00.118
I'm really sorry, Derek.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.161
Alli, I've gotta go pee,
wanna come with?

27:13.132 --> 27:14.132
No.

28:51.355 --> 28:52.845
- Hey.
- Jesus.

28:52.856 --> 28:54.847
- Phil...
- Sorry.

28:58.320 --> 29:00.982
Hey. No. Are you crazy?
Not here.

29:00.989 --> 29:02.570
It's okay, no one can see us.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.701
When are you gonna tell him?

29:14.211 --> 29:16.167
You understand that
my whole life changes, right?

29:16.588 --> 29:18.203
That's exactly what you need,
Jill.

29:19.049 --> 29:21.916
One more person
tells me what I need, I swear.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.098
Hey.

29:27.933 --> 29:28.933
I'll tell him.

29:31.853 --> 29:33.533
I promise, when we get back,
I'll tell him.

29:35.357 --> 29:36.642
I wanna be with you.

29:37.734 --> 29:38.734
Ti do.

29:42.155 --> 29:43.155
Jillh

30:13.812 --> 30:14.847
I'm sorry about earlier.

30:16.398 --> 30:17.398
It's fine.

30:20.277 --> 30:21.312
Where's alli?

30:21.820 --> 30:22.900
I thought she was with you.

30:28.577 --> 30:30.238
Hey, has anybody seen
where alli went?

30:32.122 --> 30:33.202
Alison?

30:46.970 --> 30:48.085
Alison?

30:50.182 --> 30:51.217
Alison?

30:52.100 --> 30:53.135
Alli!

30:56.188 --> 30:57.268
Alli!

30:59.232 --> 31:00.232
Alison!

31:03.403 --> 31:07.521
Jd j

31:09.993 --> 31:11.733
alli!

31:14.164 --> 31:15.244
Alison!

31:21.838 --> 31:22.838
Alli!

31:40.190 --> 31:41.805
Alli?

31:42.275 --> 31:43.685
How come you didn't answer? I...

31:48.073 --> 31:50.234
Jesus, fuck...

31:51.576 --> 31:52.656
What did that?

31:56.790 --> 31:57.790
Alison?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.491
Hey.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.703
It looks like it was
killed for sport, or something.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.459
Alli, what are you doing?

32:13.807 --> 32:14.807
Still warm.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.341
Alli, are you okay?

32:34.494 --> 32:35.614
Let's get out of here, okay?

32:38.039 --> 32:39.799
- C'mon.
- It's not safe here.

32:56.683 --> 32:58.014
What happened?

32:58.018 --> 33:00.134
Nothing, she...
Found a dead animal.

33:00.145 --> 33:02.101
Dead? That thing
was fucking mutilated.

33:02.105 --> 33:03.436
Mutilated?

33:03.440 --> 33:04.930
Yeah, its guts were everywhere.

33:04.941 --> 33:06.477
All right, can we just do this
so we can get out of here?

33:06.485 --> 33:07.725
- Sun's about to set.
- Yeah.

33:07.736 --> 33:09.146
Yeah, yeah. Um, okay one of us
needs to drive

33:09.154 --> 33:10.690
while the rest of us... push.

33:10.697 --> 33:11.897
Are you okay to drive?

33:14.367 --> 33:15.367
Yeah.

33:15.994 --> 33:16.994
Yeah?

33:17.370 --> 33:19.452
Okay. Uh, let's go.

33:26.379 --> 33:28.415
All right. You guys ready?

33:28.423 --> 33:29.913
You ready? Okay.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.920
Give it a little bit of gas,
and...

33:32.928 --> 33:34.384
Push!

33:34.387 --> 33:36.343
- Push! Keep going! Little more!
- Got it!

33:38.016 --> 33:39.552
Good! Keep going! = push!

33:40.602 --> 33:42.388
Stop it! Stop it!
Park it, park it!

33:42.395 --> 33:43.510
Nice.

33:43.522 --> 33:44.522
Nice!

34:01.581 --> 34:03.196
What the fuck was that?!

34:04.125 --> 34:06.537
You did that on purpose!
Get the fuck out of the truck!

34:06.545 --> 34:08.034
Why would you think...

34:08.045 --> 34:09.331
- Could've fucking killed me!
- Relax!

34:09.339 --> 34:10.545
You saw that! She gave it gas!

34:10.549 --> 34:11.755
- Derek!
- She gave it gas!

34:11.757 --> 34:12.757
You fucking saw her!

34:16.763 --> 34:18.299
Get the fuck off me!

34:20.058 --> 34:21.172
Jill.

34:21.184 --> 34:22.469
= fuck.

34:23.895 --> 34:24.895
Shit.

34:25.021 --> 34:26.261
= Jill... - Derek, hey.

34:26.273 --> 34:27.433
Don't touch me! Don't.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.356
Fuck!

34:30.360 --> 34:31.315
Are you okay?

34:31.319 --> 34:32.728
Aah! Fuck!

34:32.737 --> 34:33.737
It's okay.

34:39.661 --> 34:41.242
We need to get out of here, now.

34:47.043 --> 34:48.579
This thing isn't going anywhere.

34:53.049 --> 34:54.539
Your friends are
really fucked up.

34:57.178 --> 34:58.338
It's okay.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.972
Jill, alli, I...

35:02.976 --> 35:04.591
Look, just chill, just chill.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.020
- What?
- Alli...

35:06.563 --> 35:07.563
I'm sorry.

35:11.276 --> 35:13.813
The sun's gonna set soon
and it's gonna get a lot colder.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.026
We need to get moving.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.315
I wanna go home.

35:16.323 --> 35:18.109
- It's okay.
- I wanna go home.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.231
I know, I know. It's okay.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.034
Okay, does anybody
have a signal yet?

35:23.496 --> 35:25.176
We need to let someone know
we're out here.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.038
Should've done that
a long time ago.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.042
Yeah, anyone?

35:29.544 --> 35:31.000
Anything? = Jill.

35:31.796 --> 35:32.831
What?

35:32.839 --> 35:34.670
You had a signal earlier.

35:34.674 --> 35:37.541
Guys look, I... I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.053
Okay?

35:42.223 --> 35:43.223
I'm not dressed for this.

35:44.559 --> 35:46.439
All right everyone,
let's get back in the truck.

35:58.198 --> 35:58.983
Guys, I'm gonna try and
get a bit higher,

35:58.990 --> 36:00.275
see if I can get a signal.

36:01.826 --> 36:02.826
Hey, Philip.

36:04.913 --> 36:05.993
Why don't you come with me?

36:09.125 --> 36:10.205
Yeah, sure.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.456
Jd j

36:27.686 --> 36:29.051
It's starting to snow.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.352
- You getting anything?
- No.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.031
Yo, man!

36:41.324 --> 36:42.359
What the fuck?!

36:48.873 --> 36:49.873
Tell me what?

36:53.169 --> 36:54.659
Nothing? Okay.

36:54.671 --> 36:56.207
You know, I guess I'm gonna go
ask Jill what this means.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.329
- Derek.
- What?!

36:57.340 --> 36:58.340
Derek.

36:59.426 --> 37:01.570
We need to focus on how we're
gonna get out of here, okay?

37:01.594 --> 37:03.084
Okay, yeah. Let's focus, sure.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.632
Right after I have a little chat
with Jill.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.755
Do you remember
what just happened?

37:08.977 --> 37:10.717
You're gonna make this
really easy for me.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.400
So it's true.

37:18.403 --> 37:19.403
Yeah?

37:21.573 --> 37:23.438
You know what,
as soon as we get back home...

37:23.950 --> 37:25.360
I'm getting you
kicked off the team.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.858
Bye-bye scholarship,

37:26.870 --> 37:28.590
one-way ticket
back to Gary fucking Indiana!

37:33.293 --> 37:34.453
I'll tell her you were there.

37:43.219 --> 37:44.219
What?

37:44.512 --> 37:45.592
That night with Alison.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.182
The video.

37:48.850 --> 37:50.841
You were there. Right?

37:57.484 --> 37:58.484
Excuse me?

37:59.402 --> 38:01.563
Some of your friends,
on the team?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.487
They got big mouths.

38:06.034 --> 38:07.034
Who told you?

38:09.662 --> 38:10.902
Well, you just confirmed it.

38:12.540 --> 38:14.155
- I didn't do anything.
- Exactly.

38:15.585 --> 38:16.745
You didn't stop it.

38:18.254 --> 38:19.664
You didn't tell Jill!

38:21.341 --> 38:22.421
The only reason that you are not
suspended with the rest of them

38:22.425 --> 38:23.915
is because they are protecting
you

38:23.927 --> 38:25.258
out of some fucked up
sense of loyalty!

38:25.261 --> 38:26.941
I left...
I didn't know, okay? I...

38:31.142 --> 38:33.053
What do you think you're doing
here anyway?

38:33.061 --> 38:35.421
You really think that they're
gonna believe some hood rat...

38:35.939 --> 38:37.600
- Over me?
- Oh, wow.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.314
True colors, huh?

38:41.778 --> 38:42.778
I guess we'll find out.

38:46.741 --> 38:47.741
Derek.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.275
If we start this right now,

38:51.579 --> 38:54.366
it isn't going to end well
for either of us.

38:55.416 --> 38:57.907
We need to concentrate on how
we're gonna get out of here

38:57.919 --> 38:59.875
or we are gonna
freeze to death, okay?

39:04.717 --> 39:06.253
You and I can
deal with this later.

39:24.195 --> 39:25.195
Anything?

39:25.989 --> 39:26.989
No.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.276
How much gas we got left?

39:34.539 --> 39:36.951
A quarter tank.
That's a few hours at most.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.537
How far could we possibly be
from the main road?

39:41.045 --> 39:44.208
It can't be that far. We could
probably walk to it from here.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.132
I saw we just chill and
wait for someone to find us.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.170
Who knows that we're out here?

39:54.601 --> 39:55.681
Do you have a roadside kit?

39:57.312 --> 40:00.679
Uh... yeah, I think, in the back.
Behind you, Matty.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.195
Derek...

40:14.537 --> 40:15.822
What, I didn't know we'd be

40:15.830 --> 40:17.616
off-roading in a
fucking wasteland.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.955
Guys, I'm sorry.

40:27.675 --> 40:28.915
We can't stay here the night.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.424
Someone has to go for help.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.838
No way, bro,
we'd freeze out there.

40:36.392 --> 40:37.427
We could freeze in here.

40:38.353 --> 40:40.594
Dude, I packed
for a hot tub, man.

40:41.230 --> 40:42.720
Drinking beer, not...

40:43.066 --> 40:45.022
Sleeping out in the woods.

40:46.778 --> 40:47.778
What's your problem?

40:49.405 --> 40:50.405
My problem?

40:54.202 --> 40:57.319
Well, for starters, I'm stuck
god-knows-where

40:57.330 --> 40:59.286
with a bunch of lunatics who,
by the sounds of it,

40:59.290 --> 41:01.030
are the reason
I might freeze to death.

41:02.085 --> 41:03.996
No one
is going to freeze to death.

41:04.003 --> 41:05.003
I'll go.

41:06.214 --> 41:07.579
- What?
- I'll go.

41:10.635 --> 41:11.841
I'll go for help.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.719
It's my fault.

41:17.183 --> 41:19.344
It can't be that far
until I find a signal

41:19.352 --> 41:20.842
and then I'll just, I'll...

41:21.270 --> 41:23.670
I'll call someone and I'll let
them know that we're stranded.

41:26.567 --> 41:28.103
Okay, well, you can't go alone.

41:28.778 --> 41:29.778
- We'll go.
- What?

41:30.571 --> 41:32.402
I'm not going anywhere.

41:32.407 --> 41:33.817
You're definitely not leaving
me here with these people.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.565
= I'll be fine.
I'll go with you.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.365
What?

41:38.663 --> 41:40.324
- No, alli...
- I don't wanna be here anymore.

41:40.331 --> 41:41.946
Alli, listen to me...

41:41.958 --> 41:43.664
I'm not staying in this fucking
place any longer.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.868
- Alli, it should be...
- I'm not a fucking child, Jill!

41:51.426 --> 41:53.291
Well, whoever's going
better get moving.

42:13.072 --> 42:14.437
Hey.

42:16.951 --> 42:18.191
Please be safe man.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.614
T was born for this shit.

42:25.793 --> 42:26.953
You sure you wanna do this?

42:28.421 --> 42:29.421
Yeah.

42:41.726 --> 42:44.183
Alli. C'mon, we should go.

42:46.856 --> 42:48.892
- Yeah. Be safe. Yeah.
- I'll see you.

43:03.039 --> 43:05.872
Jd j

43:50.711 --> 43:51.711
Could you not?

43:53.131 --> 43:54.131
What?

43:57.510 --> 43:59.751
Okay, easy.
I didn't realize I was doing it.

44:01.264 --> 44:02.824
That's a bit of a thing
with you, right?

44:11.190 --> 44:12.771
They've been gone
a really long time.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.398
They'll be back soon.

44:22.243 --> 44:23.243
What was that?

44:29.125 --> 44:30.125
Animal, maybe?

44:44.599 --> 44:46.399
Hey, can we turn up
the heat for a little bit?

44:46.809 --> 44:47.889
I can't feel my toes.

44:49.979 --> 44:50.979
Derek.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.683
Yeah.

45:12.126 --> 45:13.406
Shit, this... shit!

45:39.862 --> 45:40.862
Turn off your light.

45:56.379 --> 45:57.459
Everyone lock your doors.

46:06.389 --> 46:08.389
What the fuck?

46:09.767 --> 46:11.632
- No, I'm just gonna...
- No, don't.

46:25.491 --> 46:26.606
What the hell is that?

46:42.717 --> 46:43.717
Alison?

46:43.801 --> 46:44.801
Oh, my god.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.881
[Moani - caning

46:47.888 --> 46:49.253
alli, are you hurt? What's...?1

46:49.682 --> 46:51.718
c'mon. Let's go, let's go.
= come on. Come on.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.347
Derek, I need my phone
for some light.

46:55.354 --> 46:57.140
- What's wrong with her?
- Derek, the phone!

46:57.148 --> 46:58.729
Alli, what...
What happened, okay?

46:59.150 --> 47:01.232
Oh, shit.

47:01.235 --> 47:02.645
Talk to us.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.297
I don't... I don't see a cut.

47:08.784 --> 47:09.944
Maybe it's not her blood.

47:13.706 --> 47:15.742
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Where's tod?

47:15.750 --> 47:17.081
Wait, hey, where's my brother?

47:17.084 --> 47:18.449
Alison, is he okay?

47:18.461 --> 47:19.871
Matty, don't panic,
just give her a second.

47:19.879 --> 47:21.244
Can you please tell me
where my brother is?

47:21.255 --> 47:22.665
- Is he okay?
- She's in shock.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.433
Can you please talk to us?!
= she's in shock!

47:25.426 --> 47:26.541
What is in her hand?

47:27.762 --> 47:28.877
Oh, shit.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.402
If he's out there,
he could be hurt.

47:34.226 --> 47:35.226
Matty, don't.

47:43.402 --> 47:45.518
God, ow!
Alli, you're hurting me!

47:45.529 --> 47:46.735
Guys, help Mel! Matty!

47:47.365 --> 47:48.980
Derek, Jesus Christ, help!

47:48.991 --> 47:50.276
I'm trying!

47:50.284 --> 47:52.946
Alii...

47:52.953 --> 47:55.740
Her heart is racing.
Has this happened to her before?

47:55.748 --> 47:57.204
I don't know.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.539
Is she on any
medication or anything?

47:58.542 --> 47:59.622
I don't know, I don't know.

47:59.627 --> 48:01.037
Check her bag! = huh?

48:01.045 --> 48:02.501
For medicine!
God, she's burning up.

48:02.505 --> 48:05.087
Alli, wake up.

48:05.091 --> 48:06.547
Please. Please. Please wake up.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.915
Please, can you tell me
where my brother is?

48:07.927 --> 48:09.292
Matty, don't!

48:09.303 --> 48:10.668
Can you tell me
where my brother is?!

48:10.679 --> 48:12.089
Matty, just give her a second!
God!

48:12.723 --> 48:13.758
The fuck is she saying?

48:16.519 --> 48:18.239
Alli...

48:18.646 --> 48:19.646
Here.

48:20.815 --> 48:23.397
- Clonazepam? I don't...
- It's anti-anxiety pills.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.337
They use that on people
who have seizures sometimes.

48:25.361 --> 48:26.441
My brother used to get them.

48:26.445 --> 48:28.310
It calms the nervous system.

48:28.322 --> 48:30.592
Let's just giver her one. Here,
just put it under her tongue.

48:30.616 --> 48:33.449
Okay. Okay.

48:34.578 --> 48:35.578
Okay.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.619
Get her off me!

48:44.630 --> 48:46.461
- Alli!
- Jesus Christ!

48:46.465 --> 48:48.001
- Let go!
- Alli! Alli!

48:48.008 --> 48:49.123
Stop! Stop!

48:51.011 --> 48:52.011
Fuck.

48:54.765 --> 48:55.765
Bree?

48:56.475 --> 48:57.965
Oh, shit.

48:58.269 --> 48:59.269
Fuck.

48:59.562 --> 49:01.393
What's happening?

49:01.397 --> 49:03.137
Okay. Okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay. Just...

49:03.149 --> 49:04.389
Stay still.

49:04.775 --> 49:06.857
Okay? Don't move.

49:14.076 --> 49:15.486
Bree, Bree stop moving!

49:19.623 --> 49:21.033
I said you should stay still!

49:21.041 --> 49:22.041
Stop moving!

49:24.003 --> 49:25.959
- Shit!
- Fuck!

49:25.963 --> 49:27.419
We need to stop the bleeding.

49:27.423 --> 49:29.084
Is there
a first aid kit in the car?

49:29.091 --> 49:30.581
Derek! First aid kit! C'mon!

49:32.511 --> 49:35.048
That's it, take the gauze and
p-put the alcohol on it. Okay?

49:37.433 --> 49:40.425
Matty. Ma... Matty, hey!
Hey, stay with me.

49:40.436 --> 49:42.017
Okay? I need you to take this

49:42.521 --> 49:44.136
and I need you to press it
against her neck.

49:44.148 --> 49:45.263
Press firmly, okay?

49:47.818 --> 49:48.978
All right, gimme your finger.

49:48.986 --> 49:51.147
Oh, fuck.

50:22.353 --> 50:23.353
Is she dead?

50:23.896 --> 50:24.896
No.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.329
No, no, she's just...
She's just in shock.

50:28.734 --> 50:29.894
She fuckin' attacked her.

50:30.778 --> 50:32.268
It was a seizure, Derek!

50:35.407 --> 50:36.522
Violent fits.

50:39.286 --> 50:40.696
It's just like she said.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.328
What are you talking about?

50:43.582 --> 50:45.038
The pamphlet she read.

50:45.709 --> 50:48.746
It's this place.
It's this fucking place.

50:48.754 --> 50:50.954
- Matty, listen to me...
- What happened out there alli?

50:52.174 --> 50:53.294
Where is my brother?

50:55.594 --> 50:57.050
- Get out of my way.
- Matt.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.214
- Out of my way.
- Matty.

51:01.892 --> 51:03.177
Help me.

51:09.233 --> 51:10.313
Matty, where are you going?

51:10.526 --> 51:11.641
Tod is out there.

51:11.986 --> 51:13.476
He needs our help.
I gotta go find him.

51:13.487 --> 51:14.727
- Matty.
- No, I can't...

51:14.738 --> 51:16.148
Matty, we need to stay together.

51:17.199 --> 51:19.030
Matty, wait. What about Bree?

51:22.663 --> 51:24.324
What if it was your brother
out there?

51:25.124 --> 51:26.124
Would you just sit here?

51:29.712 --> 51:31.919
Matty, wait!
We need to wait for someone!

51:34.091 --> 51:35.091
No one is coming.

51:36.844 --> 51:38.300
And I'm not leaving him
out there.

51:42.141 --> 51:43.551
Tod!

51:48.647 --> 51:49.647
How is she?

51:58.365 --> 51:59.775
Looks like
the bleeding has stopped,

51:59.783 --> 52:01.543
but she's gonna be
in a lot of pain if she...

52:06.624 --> 52:07.704
When she wakes up.

52:13.881 --> 52:15.087
She doesn't look good.

52:16.133 --> 52:17.498
We need to get her out of here.

52:17.509 --> 52:19.295
Yeah, I agree,
she's fucking crazy.

52:20.262 --> 52:21.798
Not alli, Bree!

52:26.560 --> 52:28.642
She just attacked me.
She attacked Bree.

52:28.646 --> 52:30.246
Who knows what she did to tod?

52:30.522 --> 52:32.729
Jesus Christ, Derek,
she didn't do anything to tod!

52:33.442 --> 52:34.442
Whose blood is that?

52:36.028 --> 52:37.143
I don't know, hers?

52:37.529 --> 52:39.611
Or... something
probably attacked them!

52:39.615 --> 52:40.730
We should put her outside.

52:41.909 --> 52:44.651
You're kidding, right?
She would die out there!

52:45.204 --> 52:47.240
Philip, you don't
agree with this. I mean...

52:47.247 --> 52:49.767
I don't think that
we should put her outside but...

52:52.169 --> 52:54.410
- Something isn't right, Jill.
- = she's sick!

52:54.421 --> 52:56.628
- She's been traumatized and...
- We'll bundle her up.

52:56.632 --> 52:57.747
We keep an eye on her.

52:59.218 --> 53:01.258
And what, tie her to a fucking
tree? Are you crazy?!

53:01.637 --> 53:03.502
Do I need to remind you
what manslaughter is?

53:03.847 --> 53:05.712
You know what? I'm not even
indulging in this.

53:05.724 --> 53:06.804
This is insane.

53:12.648 --> 53:14.288
My brother
used to have seizures.

53:17.152 --> 53:18.152
Not like that.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.728
We always used to
joke around, that he looked...

53:27.663 --> 53:28.527
Possessed.

53:28.539 --> 53:29.539
Possessed?!

53:30.332 --> 53:31.332
Where's tod?

53:33.127 --> 53:34.333
Why is she covered in blood?

53:36.130 --> 53:37.916
We put her outside
and we watch her.

53:37.923 --> 53:40.164
If she does anything we claim
self-defense. All right?

53:43.220 --> 53:44.220
What about you?

53:45.264 --> 53:47.064
- What about me?
- You attacked Alison.

53:47.433 --> 53:49.298
You crashed the truck,
maybe on purpose.

53:49.309 --> 53:51.174
I didn't crash the truck
on purpose. No.

53:51.186 --> 53:52.596
Well, how do we know that, huh?

53:52.604 --> 53:54.310
Hmm? Maybe you're possessed.

53:54.898 --> 53:56.263
What - yeah, you know what?

53:56.275 --> 53:57.765
I don't feel comfortable
with you in the truck.

53:57.776 --> 53:59.186
Philip, help me tie him up.

54:02.406 --> 54:03.395
You're being ridiculous.

54:03.407 --> 54:04.567
Exactly!

54:08.203 --> 54:09.943
Okay, fine.
But I'm tying her hands up.

54:11.373 --> 54:13.159
She does anything else,
I'm not taking any chances.

54:13.167 --> 54:15.374
She pulls any more of this
Linda Blair bullshit,

54:15.377 --> 54:17.337
I don't care what you do,
I'm putting her outside.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.668
Tod!

54:36.148 --> 54:37.308
Tod!

54:44.615 --> 54:46.071
Tod!

54:50.245 --> 54:52.827
Tod!

54:54.917 --> 54:58.956
Jd j

55:11.391 --> 55:14.007
Tod!

55:16.271 --> 55:17.681
Tod!

55:39.294 --> 55:41.626
Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

55:42.881 --> 55:45.293
What the fuck?!

56:15.455 --> 56:19.118
Jd j

56:22.671 --> 56:25.208
are you kidding me?

56:40.939 --> 56:42.139
I saw you.

56:46.361 --> 56:47.441
What'd you say?

56:53.785 --> 56:55.901
I need to find
a shirt or something.

57:01.668 --> 57:02.828
Where are you going?

57:04.212 --> 57:06.328
I'm gonna... compress some show,
make an ice pack.

57:07.382 --> 57:09.382
Try to bring down the swelling,
maybe that'll help.

57:11.470 --> 57:13.210
Hey. Be careful.

57:27.527 --> 57:30.143
Jd j

57:47.172 --> 57:48.172
Jill.

57:50.050 --> 57:51.050
Look...

57:52.886 --> 57:54.251
I just need you to know that...

57:55.931 --> 57:57.637
I know something's going on.

57:57.975 --> 57:59.055
With you guys.

58:03.689 --> 58:05.520
- Derek.
- He's a liar.

58:08.276 --> 58:09.732
He'll say anything.

58:15.617 --> 58:17.778
He lied to the coaches
about the video.

58:22.249 --> 58:24.160
He was there. He didn't stop it.

58:44.312 --> 58:45.312
What?

58:55.032 --> 58:56.693
No, no, no, no, no, no.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.900
Shit no, c'mon, c'mon.

58:59.703 --> 59:00.783
= fuck!

59:02.622 --> 59:03.622
Fuck!

59:03.665 --> 59:05.030
Fuck!

59:09.046 --> 59:10.081
Fuck.

59:11.214 --> 59:12.875
We're gonna fucking
freeze to death.

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:57.851
We need to use everything
we can to stay warm.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:00:58.852
Okay.

01:00:58.864 --> 01:00:59.864
- Here.
- Okay.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:06.944
Jd j

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.594
Hand me that.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:25.878
= move.

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:27.266
Move!

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:32.188
Here, open this.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:34.388
What do you wanna do with this?

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:35.399
Open it and dump it.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:36.974
Wait, dump it?

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:38.521
Yeah, you can eat it, but you'll
probably die from

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:39.848
food poisoning
before hypothermia.

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.728
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:02:26.826 --> 01:02:29.659
Jd j

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.811
Be, be, be so careful.

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:19.712
Fuck.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.265
Jill, just, slow,

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:35.679
- slow... okay, okay.
- Yeah, I...

01:03:37.147 --> 01:03:38.147
Don't breathe.

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.727
Should give us enough
heat to stay through the night.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.831
Jd j

01:04:27.489 --> 01:04:28.489
Tod?

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:52.172
=tod?

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.093
Why is she doing that?

01:05:41.146 --> 01:05:42.761
I can't fucking stand it
anymore!

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.182
Can you shut her up, please?!

01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:52.729
M-maybe... we should ju...

01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:54.408
What?

01:05:58.246 --> 01:05:59.736
- Don't you dare!
- Fuck this.

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:01.408
- Relax! Shut up!
- You want me to relax!

01:06:01.416 --> 01:06:03.953
- You want me to fucking relax!
- Would you shut up!

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.076
Please,
shut up, I'm so sick of you!

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:07.293
Oh, you are?

01:06:13.344 --> 01:06:14.344
Slut.

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:16.096
What?!

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:18.008
What did you say to me?!

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:21.883
Jesus Christ! What ha... what
happened to you?

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:23.510
Or have you
always been this pathetic?

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:28.188
I can't stop it.

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:31.188
I can't.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.359
You're gonna die.

01:06:37.285 --> 01:06:38.616
Who is she talking to?

01:06:39.537 --> 01:06:40.902
I'm sorry.

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:42.706
Us.

01:06:44.083 --> 01:06:47.951
She is doing this.
She is causing this to happen.

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:49.668
Fuck this! = no!

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:52.834
No. What are you doing?

01:06:52.842 --> 01:06:54.378
She's out! You wanna join her?

01:06:55.094 --> 01:06:56.094
Don't!

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:01.756
Whoa!

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:02.848
- Do it.
- Jill.

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:05.510
Don't do anything crazy, okay?

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:06.637
Help me, then!

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:07.683
Do it!

01:07:12.570 --> 01:07:13.570
Maybe he's right.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:17.991
- Hey!
- Don't.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:19.785
Don't.

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.925
= what's that noise?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:33.713
I don't... I don't hear anything.

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:35.926
Listen.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:40.639
Tod's phone!

01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:42.008
I don't hear anything!

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:43.381
He's got a signal!
He's got a signal!

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:44.883
- We have to find him!
- There's nothing out there!

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:45.633
Hey! Wait, what about...?

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:46.645
Stay with them!

01:08:26.728 --> 01:08:31.438
Jd j

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.379
Jd j

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:27.827
Alison?

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:33.095
You're freezing.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:35.537
What?

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:36.837
What's wrong?

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:38.423
Jillt

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.881
fucking Derek!

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:43.804
Jill!

01:09:44.389 --> 01:09:45.595
He found out about us.

01:09:46.224 --> 01:09:47.680
Okay, he saw your messages.

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:49.475
Jill.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.301
I swear to god,
he is lying to you.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:53.729
Okay?

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:56.358
I gotta go.

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:19.496
Guys I can hear it! It's here.

01:10:22.301 --> 01:10:24.007
C'mon, call again,
call again, call, again.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:26.886
Call again! Fuck me! Fuck!

01:10:30.143 --> 01:10:31.849
Yeah!

01:10:37.525 --> 01:10:39.811
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
No.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.571
Come on, come on.

01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:57.294
Jill?

01:11:01.174 --> 01:11:02.174
Philip?

01:11:06.846 --> 01:11:07.881
Guys?

01:11:20.610 --> 01:11:21.690
Is it locked?

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:30.796
- No! She's in here!
- Open the door!

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:36.948
Does Derek have the keys?

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:39.162
He might.

01:11:41.214 --> 01:11:42.920
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:45.957
Stay here. I'm... I'm gonna
get the keys from Derek, okay?

01:11:49.972 --> 01:11:51.052
Derek?

01:11:52.767 --> 01:11:54.223
Over here!

01:11:57.522 --> 01:12:00.138
Come on. Come on, fuck, come on.

01:12:05.321 --> 01:12:06.356
Ow, fuck.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.318
Fuck.

01:12:12.912 --> 01:12:15.369
Oh, thank god.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:20.658
Tod?

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.070
= hello?

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:23.880
Tod?

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:27.631
You left me.

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:05.085
Shit!

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:20.722
Alli! Alison!

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:03.352
Jill! = Derek!

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.312
Open the door!

01:14:05.316 --> 01:14:06.316
Derek.

01:14:10.696 --> 01:14:11.696
What happened?

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.138
She tried to kill me.

01:14:14.241 --> 01:14:15.697
Alison? She's out there?

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.111
She's gonna kill you, too.

01:14:17.787 --> 01:14:19.368
Derek, that... that's insane!

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.075
It's this place, Jill.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:24.165
No! No, Derek, Derek,
listen to yourself.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:26.659
This doesn't make any sense.
This... this is not possible!

01:14:28.673 --> 01:14:29.788
Whose blood is that?

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:34.546
D-Derek, where's Philip?
Have you... have you seen Philip?!

01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:36.388
Derek!

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:41.393
Okay.

01:14:42.436 --> 01:14:43.916
Where's the screwdriver?

01:14:44.230 --> 01:14:46.972
I mu... I must have dropped it.

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:31.853
Jd j

01:15:54.175 --> 01:15:55.540
= god dammit.

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:10.388
Jd j

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.063
She's punishing us.

01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:22.904
Punishing us?

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.123
What?

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:29.621
I was there.

01:16:31.212 --> 01:16:32.212
T was there.

01:16:32.838 --> 01:16:34.453
I didn't know they'd do that.

01:16:42.556 --> 01:16:43.966
I'm gonna die out here.

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:46.553
We have to keep moving, okay?
We...

01:16:47.103 --> 01:16:50.015
Derek, what are you doing?

01:16:50.022 --> 01:16:51.762
Leave your jacket on! No!

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.514
It's so hot in here.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:55.433
- No, its...
- I can't...

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:57.397
Derek, don't! Leave...

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.814
Derek, stop, please!

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:01.825
Don't, Derek!

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:04.494
Derek!

01:17:05.538 --> 01:17:06.538
Jill?

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:25.765
Her...

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:49.324
Why are you doing this to me?

01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:52.911
How could you do this?!

01:17:52.918 --> 01:17:55.034
What did you do?!

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:59.372
Jill!'! How could you do this?!

01:18:05.431 --> 01:18:08.389
Jd j

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:22.487
There's someone out there.

01:18:26.785 --> 01:18:27.900
Don't, please.

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.632
Derek. I need you to get up,
okay?

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:45.422
We gotta go,
we gotta make a run for it.

01:18:45.429 --> 01:18:46.509
Ti can't.

01:18:46.513 --> 01:18:47.628
Yes. Please.

01:18:48.307 --> 01:18:49.307

That they did that to her.

The guys.

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:03.477

What are you...? No!

01:22:38.579 --> 01:22:40.740
She is causing this to happen.

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.658
Why'd you do it?!

01:22:42.666 --> 01:22:45.157
Possession by the devil
and hung for witchcraft.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:49.378
- Please, I didn't...
- What happened to you?!

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:50.621

- What are you doing?!
- You killed Philip!

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:59.221
No! Jill! Listen to me, listen
to me! I didn't do anything!

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:02.216
Jill! Please!
Please, listen to me!

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:35.630
Possessed.

01:25:37.341 --> 01:25:39.957
What in god's name would make
you believe something like that?
