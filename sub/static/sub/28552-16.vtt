00:09.233 --> 00:10.530
So bad.

00:12.148 --> 00:14.530
I am the terror
that flaps in the night!

00:14.647 --> 00:17.666
I am the pebble in the
penny loafer of depravity!

00:17.756 --> 00:18.834
I am...

00:18.921 --> 00:20.536
Darkwing Duck?

00:20.623 --> 00:22.226
Ah, so you've heard of me.

00:22.335 --> 00:24.833
Let's get dangerous.

00:25.728 --> 00:27.048
Ow!

00:27.249 --> 00:29.054
Dangerous? Aah!

00:30.692 --> 00:32.194
Dangerous...

00:35.104 --> 00:36.590
Oh, my goodness.

00:37.144 --> 00:38.687
OK! You think a few

00:38.774 --> 00:41.480
very painful explosions
can stop me?

00:41.597 --> 00:44.753
Now, let's see
who you really are...

00:47.608 --> 00:48.996
Me?!

00:49.753 --> 00:51.597
Whoa, what a twist!

00:51.686 --> 00:54.102
What?! I never saw
that coming!

00:54.190 --> 00:55.707
Wait, haven't you seen
this episode?

00:55.801 --> 00:58.705
Seventy-five times!
But never in a parking lot.

00:58.793 --> 01:01.299
Sadly, beloved TV show
<i>Darkwing Duck,</i>

01:01.387 --> 01:04.063
starring me, Jim Starling,
was canceled

01:04.152 --> 01:07.470
before we could end this story.
But there's no end

01:07.558 --> 01:10.728
to the savings
at Siesta Rick's Sofa Fiesta!

01:13.425 --> 01:16.036
Let's get comfortable!

01:16.123 --> 01:19.214
Ha-ha! I'll be signing
autographs for one and all!

01:19.363 --> 01:20.584
If one and all want one!

01:20.671 --> 01:22.566
- No!
- Oh, my gosh, no.

01:22.654 --> 01:24.152
Buncha ingrates.

01:24.976 --> 01:27.423
- You good?
- Yep. Totally cool.

01:27.511 --> 01:28.904
Thanks for being here.

01:33.162 --> 01:34.799
OK, keep it together!

01:34.886 --> 01:37.027
"I am your biggest fan!" No.

01:37.115 --> 01:40.152
"I have modeled
my entire life after yours."

01:40.292 --> 01:42.190
"I wanna keep you
in a big jar in my closet!"

01:42.737 --> 01:43.952
Calm down, buddy.

01:44.039 --> 01:46.033
Jim Starling's
just a regular guy.

01:46.121 --> 01:47.642
I've been to plenty
of these signings,

01:47.730 --> 01:49.747
and one day, I'm actually
gonna meet him.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.923
Wait. If you've seen him
so many times,

01:52.011 --> 01:53.190
how come you've never
talked to him?

01:53.277 --> 01:54.384
Next!

01:54.487 --> 01:55.620
Uhh...

01:57.048 --> 01:58.066
This is why.

Great.
Who do I make this out to?

Yeah, yeah. That'll be 15 bucks.

Stay dangerous.

02:32.116 --> 02:33.203
Waaaiiit!

He'd really appreciate it
if you could sign his... poster?

02:51.611 --> 02:54.790
"#DarkwingDuck"...
Whoa! That's weird.

02:54.877 --> 02:57.181
"Darkwing Duck" is trending
number one worldwide.

02:57.268 --> 02:58.596
What?! Gimme!

02:58.971 --> 03:00.820
It says here
they're making a movie

03:00.908 --> 03:03.525
- of <i> Darkwing Duck!</i>
- They are? We am?!

03:04.203 --> 03:06.760
Darkwing Duck is back, baby!

03:06.848 --> 03:07.903
He is?!

03:09.847 --> 03:11.161
It's him! Uhh...

03:16.966 --> 03:19.870
Launchpad! Stop looking
in the rearview mirror.

03:19.957 --> 03:22.955
Yup! Totally profesh.
No problem-ohh...

03:23.770 --> 03:26.076
Hey! Fragile cargo, huh!

03:26.803 --> 03:28.924
Back on top.
Arriving on set

03:29.011 --> 03:33.083
for a big-shot movie in style.
Thanks for the ride, fans.

03:33.170 --> 03:36.899
Wow.<i> I</i> am going
to a real movie studio!

03:36.986 --> 03:39.757
Where larger-than-life
big-screen legends are born!

03:39.844 --> 03:42.963
And you get to ride there
with a real-life movie star!

03:43.926 --> 03:46.275
Musky.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.210
Are we sure about this guy?

03:48.297 --> 03:50.067
Why wouldn't the studio
send a car for him?

03:50.154 --> 03:52.447
Or, you know, tell him
the movie exists?

03:52.534 --> 03:53.993
They couldn't make a movie
without him.

03:54.080 --> 03:56.008
Jim Starling <i> is</i> Darkwing Duck!

03:56.096 --> 03:58.086
Ya dang right he is,
buddy! Heh.

03:58.173 --> 03:59.421
I'm his buddy!

03:59.509 --> 04:00.886
Uhh...

04:03.645 --> 04:06.211
Oh, man. I hope
whoever owns the studio

04:06.299 --> 04:09.955
isn't mad at...
Wait, what the...?!

04:13.127 --> 04:16.314
Sorry, you need
more money for...?

04:16.541 --> 04:18.594
The grand finale of my film.

04:18.682 --> 04:23.145
A psychological examination
of man's inhumanity to man!

04:23.232 --> 04:26.859
Alistair, I haven't
seen a movie since 1938.

04:26.947 --> 04:29.664
This studio was built to make
cheap Office Safety Videos

04:29.752 --> 04:31.041
for my company.

04:31.248 --> 04:33.890
You convinced me
a "fun little action movie"

04:33.978 --> 04:37.092
would double my profits,
but you're already over budget.

04:37.179 --> 04:40.031
If you want one penny more,
I have to be consulted

04:40.119 --> 04:41.094
on all decisions.

04:41.182 --> 04:44.900
How dare you, sir?
An artist's integrity...

04:45.088 --> 04:46.957
Splendid. The movie
should be in color.

04:47.044 --> 04:48.904
Color's all the rage
these days. Oh!

04:48.991 --> 04:51.495
And the villain is going
to need a mustache to twirl

04:51.582 --> 04:53.682
whenever he does
something evil. Heh...

04:56.665 --> 04:58.828
<i>You</i> have a movie studio

04:58.916 --> 05:01.972
that could fulfill a starry-eyed
boy's cinematic dreams.

05:02.059 --> 05:03.774
Why didn't you tell me?!

05:03.861 --> 05:06.283
To avoid
this exact conversation.

05:06.542 --> 05:08.445
OK, yeah, no, I can see that.

05:08.532 --> 05:11.259
I am the terror
that flaps in the night.

05:11.455 --> 05:12.760
I am the comeback

05:12.848 --> 05:14.198
The audience demands!

05:14.302 --> 05:18.229
I am... a huge fan,
Alistair Borswan!

05:18.317 --> 05:19.759
I mean, I've never actually
seen your work,

05:19.846 --> 05:21.462
but you're British,
so I'm sure

05:21.550 --> 05:24.732
that it's very classy,
and... yeah...

05:25.150 --> 05:27.706
Uh, yes. And you are?

05:29.393 --> 05:30.868
British and funny?

05:30.956 --> 05:32.493
Whoa! This feels like
the beginning

05:32.581 --> 05:34.508
of a great
creative partnership!

05:34.596 --> 05:37.985
Aw, cool! A big-budget reboot
of a thing I loved as a kid!

05:38.073 --> 05:39.516
Those are always great!

05:39.604 --> 05:42.220
Is Darkwing's motorcycle in it?
Is he still a noble hero

05:42.308 --> 05:43.511
who gets back up
and fights for right,

05:43.598 --> 05:45.146
no matter what evil
throws at him?

05:45.233 --> 05:47.085
You're keeping
the theme song, right?

05:47.995 --> 05:50.599
Would you like to see
the trailer?

05:50.771 --> 05:52.989
Ooh! Aah!

05:56.935 --> 05:58.505
<i>Within every man,</i>

05:58.780 --> 06:00.737
<i>there is a war.</i>

06:01.131 --> 06:04.979
- <i>Not of action, but of ideas.</i>
- Ugh!

06:05.067 --> 06:06.771
<i> There is no right or wrong.</i>

06:06.858 --> 06:10.768
<i>No heroes or villains.
Only darkness.</i>

06:13.104 --> 06:14.575
<i>There is one man</i>

06:14.662 --> 06:16.604
<i>who can fight the darkness.</i>

06:16.692 --> 06:18.331
Yeah! Here we go, baby!

06:19.450 --> 06:21.026
<i>With more darkness.</i>

06:21.114 --> 06:22.733
What's this, now?

06:26.019 --> 06:28.460
It's the Dark-wing! Run!

06:30.205 --> 06:31.908
You can't just flap around
in the night!

06:31.996 --> 06:33.460
You'll terrify people!

06:33.548 --> 06:35.600
It's too dangerous!

06:36.453 --> 06:38.835
<i>Darkwing: First Darkness.</i>

06:38.970 --> 06:41.055
<i>This film not suitable
for children.</i>

06:45.486 --> 06:46.985
That is <i> not</i> Darkwing Duck!

06:47.073 --> 06:48.641
DW'd never hurt innocent people

06:48.729 --> 06:50.235
or set the city on fire.

06:50.355 --> 06:51.446
Not on purpose.

06:51.542 --> 06:53.168
But are we all not both

06:53.256 --> 06:56.394
the heroes and the villains
of our own story?

06:56.586 --> 06:59.397
What? I don't...
What?!

06:59.485 --> 07:01.455
Well, I kinda like it!
Grim, gritty.

07:01.542 --> 07:04.782
Shows off my dark,
smoldering side. Ooh! Ahh!

07:04.870 --> 07:06.785
- I kinda hated it.
- What?!

07:06.873 --> 07:08.353
I didn't understand
what was happening

07:08.440 --> 07:10.977
or what the bad guy was doing
or even who the bad guy was.

07:11.086 --> 07:12.766
I knew he needed a moustache!

07:12.854 --> 07:15.748
It needs aliens!
Oh! Or ninjas!

07:15.835 --> 07:18.415
Or the streetwise sidekick
who skateboards everywhere

07:18.503 --> 07:21.180
and talks in catchphrases,
like ya Dewey!

07:21.268 --> 07:23.517
This is your main audience.
If this fiasco

07:23.605 --> 07:25.235
is gonna make money,
it has to appeal

07:25.323 --> 07:28.547
to the most childish child
I know. Dewey's in charge.

07:28.635 --> 07:29.665
- What?! No!
- Yes!

07:29.753 --> 07:31.963
Let's talk musical numbers!

07:32.051 --> 07:33.516
How many is not enough?

07:34.381 --> 07:36.318
Don't listen to these yahoos.

07:36.406 --> 07:38.733
We're making art!
When do we start?

07:38.897 --> 07:41.001
Uh, we're almost finished,
actually.

07:41.089 --> 07:44.922
Ah. So we're shooting
the Darkwing scenes last.

07:45.010 --> 07:46.086
No.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.834
Of course! I'll be... be put in
with CGI!

07:48.993 --> 07:52.109
You are not
playing Darkwing Duck.

07:52.260 --> 07:56.244
He is.

07:56.332 --> 07:57.969
- Huh?
- You?!

07:58.177 --> 08:01.735
Mr. Starling!
Uh, we met at the signing.

08:01.823 --> 08:03.671
You fell on me, remember?
It was a huge honor.

08:03.759 --> 08:05.218
Uh, do you have any
words of wisdom

08:05.306 --> 08:07.059
for the man
stepping into your cape?

08:09.000 --> 08:15.074

08:17.390 --> 08:19.790
That is <i> not</i> the Darkwing Duck
I know and love!

08:19.887 --> 08:21.391
Yeah! It's not me!

08:21.479 --> 08:23.352
I wish there was some way
we could show them

08:23.440 --> 08:25.088
- how great the old...
- Original.

08:25.176 --> 08:27.368
Uh,<i> original</i> Darkwing is.

08:27.456 --> 08:30.009
Hey, maybe there is.

08:33.402 --> 08:36.311
Are you with me, sidekick?

08:41.232 --> 08:42.827
OK. What's the plan?

08:42.914 --> 08:44.188
I break onto the set,

08:44.275 --> 08:46.756
you find this new
hack actor's trailer,

08:46.844 --> 08:49.178
lock him up. I replace him
in the finale,

08:49.266 --> 08:52.916
they see I'm obviously better,
I'm back on top! Any questions?

08:53.004 --> 08:54.735
- Seven.
- Pick the most important one.

08:54.891 --> 08:56.476
"Breaking in," "locking up."

08:56.564 --> 08:58.922
Doesn't that sound...
not heroic?

08:59.009 --> 09:01.571
When the chips are down
and everyone's against him,

09:01.659 --> 09:03.593
what does Darkwing Duck do?

09:03.680 --> 09:04.850
Get back up
and fight for right.

09:04.937 --> 09:07.486
And I'm Darkwing Duck,<i> right?</i>

09:07.651 --> 09:08.940
Of course!

09:13.786 --> 09:16.424
I'll have to disguise myself
to get past the guard.

09:16.542 --> 09:19.745
Luckily, I can disappear
into any role.

09:21.898 --> 09:23.934
I am the courier
who delivers the...

09:26.536 --> 09:27.639
Whoo!

09:29.010 --> 09:31.090
What production

09:31.926 --> 09:33.385

09:39.215 --> 09:40.956

locking you in here

10:35.622 --> 10:39.450
to sabotage your movie...
buddy?

10:41.778 --> 10:43.153
Ahh...

10:45.122 --> 10:46.786
Aw, man. I'm sorry.

10:48.129 --> 10:49.806
You will be, villain!

10:52.582 --> 10:53.837
I've just gotta fix the movie

10:53.925 --> 10:55.519
to make Darkwing
look like a hero!

10:55.627 --> 10:57.306
Oh, so what, you're gonna
hold me hostage?

10:57.394 --> 10:59.295
Yeah. Real heroic.

10:59.957 --> 11:01.254
Sorry! Sorry!

11:01.342 --> 11:02.519
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry!

11:04.328 --> 11:05.863
Wait, don't touch that!

11:06.004 --> 11:08.367
Whoa! A vintage
Darkwing Duck Grim Avenger.

11:08.454 --> 11:10.106
Grape Shampoo bottle?!

11:14.980 --> 11:17.306
Oh! My <i> Darkwing Adventures </i> comics!

11:17.394 --> 11:18.847
It's a complete run!

11:22.404 --> 11:23.637
Huh?

11:27.144 --> 11:28.433
Is that...?

11:28.521 --> 11:31.504
A hyper-rare Battle-Hat
Darkwing Duck Action Figure!

11:31.592 --> 11:32.956
I thought these were banned
because they posed

11:33.043 --> 11:35.127
a blinding hazard
for kids! May I?

11:35.292 --> 11:37.667
Ah, a keen eye. I insist.

11:38.745 --> 11:41.558
Ow! Cool!

11:44.501 --> 11:47.816
Gentlemen, thank you for coming
to today's presentation.

11:49.175 --> 11:50.939
What is this?

11:51.027 --> 11:53.207
Oh, you're
in the "Splash Zone."

11:54.019 --> 11:57.228
Sir, you cannot expect me
to hand over the finale

11:57.316 --> 12:00.582
of my grim, complex masterpiece
to this child.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.253
Filmmaking is a team effort!

12:02.341 --> 12:04.214
You've got to be open
to new ideas.

12:04.302 --> 12:07.803
The time: dusk.
Neon! Drama!

12:07.891 --> 12:09.473
Those big lightning tower
things!

12:09.560 --> 12:11.323
An epic showdown
between Darkwing Duck

12:11.411 --> 12:12.893
and the villainous villain
Megavolt!

12:12.981 --> 12:15.224
- Question.
- Who has a moustache.

12:15.421 --> 12:16.778
Question rescinded.

12:16.997 --> 12:21.206
Your pyro-pandemonium
is passé, Hot Couture!

12:21.293 --> 12:23.653
<i>Au contraire,</i> Darkwing.

12:23.740 --> 12:27.089
I'm setting
the fashion world... on fire!

12:28.749 --> 12:29.958
Oh, no!

12:30.514 --> 12:35.058
Aah! Work through the pain.
You got this.

12:36.019 --> 12:37.300
Oops. My bad.

12:37.387 --> 12:40.747
Hey, I had
that same lunchbox as a kid.

12:41.113 --> 12:42.544
Not like this one.

12:42.722 --> 12:44.495
Now, shocking as it may sound,

12:44.583 --> 12:46.591
I was not the coolest kid
growing up.

12:46.785 --> 12:47.862
What? No.

12:47.950 --> 12:49.635
I know, right?
But one day,

12:49.722 --> 12:52.282
I saw this show
about this hero.

12:52.369 --> 12:54.995
<i>He was unstoppable.
No matter how many times</i>

12:55.083 --> 12:57.095
<i>he was beat up or blown up
or electrocuted...</i>

12:57.183 --> 12:58.824
<i> No matter</i>
<i>how many planes he crashed or...</i>

12:58.911 --> 13:00.824
<i>Or how much property damage
he caused...</i>

13:00.911 --> 13:03.192
<i> He always got back up</i>
<i>and fought for what's right.</i>

13:03.346 --> 13:04.828
<i>So you got that lunchbox,</i>

13:04.932 --> 13:06.318
<i>everyone saw how cool you are,</i>

13:06.405 --> 13:07.998
<i>and they stopped
beating you up!</i>

13:08.085 --> 13:10.102
<i> Oh, no. They...</i>
<i>They beat me up much harder.</i>

13:10.189 --> 13:13.572
<i>But I kept... getting... up.</i>

13:17.506 --> 13:19.709
Look, I know
this movie's not perfect.

13:19.796 --> 13:21.099
But I really want
to make it better.

13:21.186 --> 13:22.901
Then, maybe I can be
on the lunchbox

13:22.988 --> 13:25.044
that inspires
some other kid like me.

13:25.402 --> 13:27.105
And a cut of the toy sales
would be nice.

13:27.192 --> 13:30.300
You are a true fan.
We can save this movie!

13:30.388 --> 13:31.743
We gotta tell Mr. Starling.

13:31.919 --> 13:33.178
Yeah, I... I don't know.

13:33.272 --> 13:36.512
He kind of wants to make me
not alive anymore.

13:36.957 --> 13:40.661
Get your cape.
We're gonna save <i> Darkwing Duck.</i>

13:47.524 --> 13:50.117
How hard can it be to find
an idiot in a purple cape?

13:50.305 --> 13:53.443
Follow me, Darkwing Dance Crew.
To stardom!

13:53.530 --> 13:55.124
One, two, three, and four.

13:55.212 --> 13:56.891
Up and down
and left and right.

13:57.079 --> 13:58.715
Left and right
and up and down.

13:58.802 --> 14:00.430
Up and down
and left and right.

14:00.526 --> 14:02.052
It's so easy, it's so right.

14:02.139 --> 14:03.858
Up and down
and left and right.

14:03.946 --> 14:05.555
Up and down and left and right.

14:05.642 --> 14:07.187
Left and right and up and down.

14:07.274 --> 14:08.952
Up and down
and left and right.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.280
Dewey, the actor
playing Darkwing is a big fan,

14:11.368 --> 14:13.915
so Jim can give him pointers
and help make him more heroic,

14:14.003 --> 14:15.721
and together,
we're going to convince Borswan

14:15.808 --> 14:17.467
to fix the movie.
Have you seen Jim?

14:17.555 --> 14:19.085
He might be on my set!
They're letting me do

14:19.172 --> 14:20.770
whatever I want,
and it's crazy and huge,

14:20.857 --> 14:22.943
and I don't even know
if it's any good. Follow me!

14:23.031 --> 14:24.429
Making movies is fun!

14:25.642 --> 14:27.812
Mr. Starling! There you are.

14:27.986 --> 14:31.343
- Mm!
- I am so sorry about... everything.

14:31.535 --> 14:33.560
You helped me
through a really rough time.

14:33.648 --> 14:35.304
Your heart is in my lunchbox.

14:35.882 --> 14:37.710
Come work on the movie
with me.

14:37.879 --> 14:39.405
Together, we can inspire

14:39.531 --> 14:43.804
a new generation and make
the best <i> Darkwing Duck</i> ever!

14:45.549 --> 14:47.734
Yes. I will.

14:49.912 --> 14:52.320
Ow! Oh! Why?

14:52.468 --> 14:56.171
We! Fix movie.
Together. Why?

14:56.259 --> 14:59.872
Stupid. Movie star.
Face. Get. In!

15:02.354 --> 15:04.299
Showtime!

15:24.257 --> 15:25.591
What?! No, no, no,
no, no, no!

15:25.679 --> 15:27.637
Easy, Matthew.
Don't want that baby

15:27.724 --> 15:29.843
out of tune
for the big musical number.

15:29.939 --> 15:33.005
What did you do to my
psychological masterpiece?

15:33.093 --> 15:36.468
I added chainsaw jugglers.
You're welcome.

15:38.602 --> 15:41.184
- I don't know about this.
- Thank you!

15:41.271 --> 15:42.908
The villain's moustache
has to be

15:43.003 --> 15:44.755
at least twice as twirly.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.773
Listen...

15:50.861 --> 15:53.357
Ignore all these distractions.
Stick to our script.

15:53.445 --> 15:57.689
Darkwing confronts Megavolt,
surrenders, then takes a knee.

15:57.776 --> 15:59.419
Excuse me!

15:59.507 --> 16:01.493
I didn't work this hard
to make a comeback

16:01.580 --> 16:03.695
just to lose a fight
to that joker.

16:03.782 --> 16:06.124
Oh! There you are!
Did you find...?

16:06.226 --> 16:09.523
Uh, that actor kid? Yeah.
Said I could film the finale.

16:09.688 --> 16:11.581
- He... did?
- Oh, yeah.

16:11.668 --> 16:14.578
Stubbed his toe
really badly and just quit.

16:14.732 --> 16:18.349
Movie stars. One little boo-boo
and they fall apart.

16:18.475 --> 16:19.984
That doesn't sound like him.

16:20.072 --> 16:22.913
And why are you
saying things all mean?

16:28.585 --> 16:30.893
And... action!

16:34.720 --> 16:37.724
You can't defeat me!
I'm awesome!

16:37.983 --> 16:41.044
Surrender, and do it now!

16:41.578 --> 16:44.841
I've lost... the ability
to surrender

16:44.929 --> 16:48.036
to a two-bit,
ten-watt dim bulb like you!

16:48.124 --> 16:49.519
Wait. Who is that?

16:49.606 --> 16:51.955
Why isn't his robot face
coming off?

16:52.042 --> 16:53.211
Feast on this!

17:01.203 --> 17:02.420
Quick! Cut!

17:02.507 --> 17:03.890
No cuts!

17:05.121 --> 17:07.436
- Jim Starling never cuts!
- Huh?

17:07.523 --> 17:09.715
I'll film
this finale if it kills me.

17:09.804 --> 17:11.896
And everyone on this roof!

17:11.983 --> 17:15.377
I am the terror that
flaps in the night.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.602
I am the overstuffed burrito

17:17.689 --> 17:20.671
that spills
onto the lap of crime.

17:21.093 --> 17:24.554
I am Darkwing Duck!

17:24.695 --> 17:26.640
No,<i> I am!</i>

17:34.141 --> 17:35.977
What is that idiot doing?

17:36.065 --> 17:39.304
Drawing fire.
Get everyone out!

17:42.927 --> 17:43.998
Ugh!

17:45.246 --> 17:46.825
We've gotta stop the flames!

17:46.913 --> 17:49.606
I'll keep him distracted.
You turn on the rain machine.

17:51.508 --> 17:54.023
Let's. Get. Dangerous.

17:54.337 --> 17:56.198
- This is so cool!
- I know!

17:56.286 --> 17:57.642
It feels so right!

18:06.516 --> 18:07.848
Ha-ha!

18:10.130 --> 18:12.333
What?! I knocked you out cold.

18:12.436 --> 18:13.669
Like, a lot!

18:13.757 --> 18:15.036
I don't want to brag,

18:15.124 --> 18:17.997
but I'm incredibly strong
and resilient.

18:18.204 --> 18:20.457
Oh, really?

18:22.132 --> 18:24.083
- Darkwing!
- No!

18:26.887 --> 18:28.144
Uh, what?

18:30.442 --> 18:32.622
Get back up.

18:38.290 --> 18:39.529
Darkwing!

18:39.616 --> 18:41.079
No!

18:45.734 --> 18:49.039
Why won't you stay down?

18:56.321 --> 18:58.574
Keep... getting... up...

19:15.974 --> 19:17.859
Uncle Scrooge,
stop the bad guy!

19:18.010 --> 19:19.648
Which is the bad guy?!

19:19.736 --> 19:22.490
If only one
had a blasted moustache!

19:29.916 --> 19:31.624
Oh!

19:34.192 --> 19:35.503
Aah!

19:40.210 --> 19:43.214
Show's over, Dead Meat Duck.

19:43.301 --> 19:45.254
Stop!

19:45.548 --> 19:47.629
You're not a villain.
You're a hero.

19:47.746 --> 19:49.365
Our hero.

19:49.637 --> 19:51.590
No matter how hopeless
things got,

19:51.678 --> 19:54.629
Darkwing Duck got back up
and did what was right.

19:54.786 --> 19:56.873
For Darkwing Duck
is bigger than one man.

19:57.012 --> 19:58.987
He is the hope
that flaps in the night.

19:59.075 --> 20:01.733
This may be the most eloquent
Launchpad has ever been.

20:01.820 --> 20:03.973
He knows a lot
about this one thing.

20:04.061 --> 20:06.114
But he is light. Just.

20:06.218 --> 20:08.692
And the most tenacious part
of all good men.

20:08.801 --> 20:09.986
Um, Launchpad?

20:10.106 --> 20:11.587
Inspiring the citizenry
to rise

20:11.674 --> 20:12.744
to a new Promethean...

20:12.831 --> 20:14.791
Hey, dummy, it's about to blow!

20:14.878 --> 20:16.948
You really can't stop him
once he gets started.

20:17.035 --> 20:19.028
Well, yeah.
He's your biggest fan.

20:19.116 --> 20:20.387
one who subjugates his will.

20:20.474 --> 20:21.700
To the will
of the common good.

20:21.826 --> 20:23.587
A caring duck of mystery.

20:23.675 --> 20:25.028
A champion of right.

20:25.116 --> 20:28.471
Who is the cunning mind
behind that shadowy disguise?

20:28.558 --> 20:30.283
- I got ya!
- No, I got him!

20:30.371 --> 20:31.963
About ourselv... unh!

20:51.786 --> 20:53.296
That was the perfect end!

20:53.383 --> 20:55.489
A hero grappling
with his dark id.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.828
In a cleansing rain!
Here's the footage.

21:09.048 --> 21:11.358
No! Over the entire fight?

21:11.446 --> 21:13.383
It's... my masterpiece.

21:13.470 --> 21:16.374
Well, this was a disaster.
I'm shutting this down.

21:16.461 --> 21:19.355
There will never be
a <i> Darkwing Duck</i> movie.

21:19.442 --> 21:21.357
Well, there's still
no sign of Starling.

21:21.444 --> 21:23.314
The movie's ruined,
I lost my big break,

21:23.401 --> 21:26.017
my hero tried to kill me, and - oh!
I blew him up.

21:26.104 --> 21:27.552
Oh, what am I gonna do now?

21:27.639 --> 21:30.774
What Darkwing Duck
always does: Get back up.

21:31.230 --> 21:33.246
You know, you could
do this for real.

21:33.490 --> 21:34.600
What? Be a superhero?

21:34.688 --> 21:36.706
I mean sure, I'm scrappy,
I'm brave,

21:36.793 --> 21:37.929
I look great in the cape.

21:38.016 --> 21:39.197
Gizmoduck does it.

21:39.284 --> 21:41.044
I <i> am</i> better than Gizmoduck.

21:41.131 --> 21:42.754
It's one thing
to play a hero.

21:42.842 --> 21:44.905
And it's another thing
to actually be a hero.

21:45.102 --> 21:46.587
Do it for Jim.

21:48.471 --> 21:49.752
I don't know, I...

21:49.839 --> 21:51.629
This whole thing
sounds like it could get...

21:51.717 --> 21:52.818
Dangerous?

21:56.075 --> 21:58.111
You already got one fan.

22:02.183 --> 22:04.771
"Drake Mallard."
Never heard of ya.

22:12.307 --> 22:14.099
It was all a setup.

22:14.287 --> 22:16.433
That hack put my fan
in danger

22:16.521 --> 22:19.715
to steal the glory
and humiliate me.

22:19.927 --> 22:22.073
They want grim
and gritty, huh?

22:22.160 --> 22:24.326
Happy to play the part.
