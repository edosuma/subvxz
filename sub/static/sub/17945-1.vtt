01:48.667 --> 01:50.208
Wot u doing?

01:51.458 --> 01:53.042
I'm waiting! I'm cold!

01:53.125 --> 01:54.875
We shall now look

01:55.375 --> 01:58.083
at the deep meaning of this text...

01:58.375 --> 02:00.917
Stop it and listen to your dad!

02:01.542 --> 02:05.042
We worship You and beseech Your aid.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.208
Guide us on the path of righteousness.

02:32.458 --> 02:34.708
What are you looking at, bastard?

02:35.292 --> 02:36.583
Fuck off!

02:44.250 --> 02:45.542
<i>You looking at me?</i>

02:46.042 --> 02:48.250
<i>Really? You looking at me?</i>

02:50.458 --> 02:52.792
<i>Reckon you'll get married, Dounia?</i>

02:52.875 --> 02:54.417
<i>Are you mental?</i>

02:54.500 --> 02:56.375
<i>Me, get married?</i>

02:56.458 --> 02:58.458
<i>Girl got attitude!</i>

02:58.542 --> 02:59.917
<i>Maimouna!</i>

03:00.000 --> 03:02.458
<i>I want some eye contact, Maimouna!</i>

03:02.542 --> 03:03.458
<i>That's it!</i>

03:03.542 --> 03:06.083
<i>We're at the Roma camp.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

03:14.708 --> 03:16.333
<i>Been up all night.</i>

03:16.417 --> 03:19.083
<i>-Great for school!</i>
<i>-No way!</i>

03:19.375 --> 03:21.750
<i>Mrs. Labutte, we're out of it.</i>

03:23.542 --> 03:24.875
<i>If you're a woman.</i>

03:25.542 --> 03:26.833
<i>If you're a woman, I said.</i>

03:27.292 --> 03:28.583
<i>If you're not...</i>

03:29.292 --> 03:30.500
<i>forget it.</i>

03:35.667 --> 03:37.458
<i>Don't help her!</i>

03:40.375 --> 03:42.250
<i>Push her, push her!</i>

03:48.750 --> 03:51.208
<i>Go, Maimouna, put on a show!</i>

03:54.042 --> 03:55.375
<i>Classy...</i>

04:01.208 --> 04:02.458
<i>She fell!</i>

04:03.958 --> 04:05.583
<i>My, my, my Maimouna!</i>

04:05.667 --> 04:07.458
<i>I said, my Maimouna!</i>

04:08.583 --> 04:10.292
<i>She thinks she's a princess.</i>

04:10.875 --> 04:12.125
<i>Many thanks!</i>

04:16.375 --> 04:17.500
<i>Get off!</i>

04:18.625 --> 04:20.500
<i>-Go on.</i>
<i>-I'm not going in.</i>

04:20.583 --> 04:22.583
<i>We might find something sick.</i>

04:26.417 --> 04:28.208
<i>We are not alone!</i>

04:28.417 --> 04:30.042
<i>We are not alone!</i>

04:31.667 --> 04:33.875
<i>-Look at my hands.</i>
<i>-What?</i>

04:34.042 --> 04:36.625
<i>My hands are made for gold</i>

04:36.708 --> 04:39.375
<i>because I'm the queen of the world!</i>

05:20.583 --> 05:22.083
Keep moving.

06:02.292 --> 06:03.375
Come on.

06:18.542 --> 06:22.667
Why do you want to join us
in this project?

06:23.375 --> 06:26.458
So I can learn new things,

06:26.875 --> 06:28.333
venture into the unknown.

06:29.167 --> 06:32.542
It's a style
completely different from my own.

06:33.583 --> 06:35.792
I've always relished a challenge.

06:43.083 --> 06:44.208
Next!

06:45.000 --> 06:46.042
Hello.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.250
A total lack of technique.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.250
No emotion, darling, no artistry.

07:19.875 --> 07:22.292
It's mechanical, robotic...

07:23.208 --> 07:25.542
There's no soul, I don't feel the soul.

07:25.708 --> 07:26.958
I don't feel the dance!

07:29.125 --> 07:31.167
Come on, let's go.

07:32.292 --> 07:33.292
Come on!

07:36.042 --> 07:39.417
A can, a bar of chocolate
and a lolly, only two euros.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.667
I'll have some.

07:41.250 --> 07:42.208
Here we go.

07:42.292 --> 07:43.333
Chocolate bar...

07:44.500 --> 07:45.417
Lighters?

07:45.500 --> 07:47.542
-They're crap.
-What?

07:47.708 --> 07:48.708
They run out too quick.

07:48.792 --> 07:51.792
These are the best.
What d'you mean, crap?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.875
Bics are shit next to these.
Just one click...

07:54.958 --> 07:58.958
Crickets are the future!
They don't even have these in China yet.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.542
Maimouna, pack up!

08:04.583 --> 08:05.917
Get a move on.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.375
The bell's rung.

08:11.042 --> 08:14.042
It's door 206, second floor, on the right.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.042
-That way?
-Okay.

08:16.125 --> 08:18.750
I'll give you a little leaflet

08:18.833 --> 08:20.000
against racism.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.125
No, thanks.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.917
"Have a good afternoon."

08:23.000 --> 08:23.875
Have a good afternoon.

08:23.958 --> 08:26.000
We'll start again, Dounia.

08:26.083 --> 08:29.083
But this time,
remember something very important.

08:29.250 --> 08:30.375
And that is...?

08:30.875 --> 08:31.833
The smile.

08:31.917 --> 08:33.917
We get it! We've done it ten times!

08:34.000 --> 08:35.458
Dounia, please.

08:35.542 --> 08:36.458
You got it?

08:36.542 --> 08:37.583
I got it.

08:37.667 --> 08:39.208
We'll start again.

08:39.792 --> 08:40.792
Okay.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.667
Stop acting silly.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.083
Stop it, please.

08:48.250 --> 08:49.833
With a smile!

08:51.458 --> 08:53.500
Very funny, everyone's laughing.

08:53.583 --> 08:54.750
This is for an exam!

08:55.292 --> 08:56.458
Okay, start.

08:57.208 --> 09:00.708
Your back against the backrest
and you sit up straight!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.375
That's it. Thank you.

09:05.500 --> 09:07.375
Can I take your name, please?

09:07.458 --> 09:10.167
No, make things difficult for her.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.375
There has to be a conflict.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.500
I want to see her right away!

09:16.792 --> 09:17.917
Deal with it.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.583
Okay, I'll stay calm.

09:20.625 --> 09:21.458
Listen, madam.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.917
That won't be possible because...

09:25.667 --> 09:27.667
-Why'd you do that?
-I didn't mean to.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.917
-I saw you.
-I didn't mean to!

09:30.000 --> 09:33.208
-No need to shout.
-What are you gonna do about it?

09:33.292 --> 09:34.500
I'm being polite!

09:34.583 --> 09:38.458
Stop now.
You're role-playing. It isn't real.

09:38.542 --> 09:40.042
We know it isn't real.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.208
-Sit down.
-Sit down, Jisca.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.042
Dounia, you take her place.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.167
Go on.

09:51.292 --> 09:52.208
So...

09:52.792 --> 09:53.958
What can I do for you?

09:54.542 --> 09:55.583
Well, already...

09:55.750 --> 09:57.792
You've forgotten the first thing.

09:58.167 --> 10:00.833
Unforgivable!
You've forgotten the smile.

10:01.583 --> 10:02.875
The first thing!

10:02.958 --> 10:05.667
-The smile!
-Calm down.

10:05.750 --> 10:06.958
Don't talk to me like that.

10:10.375 --> 10:13.708
You could walk this exam.
Okay, sit down.

10:13.792 --> 10:16.792
My mum's a hostess.
She didn't need your shitty exam.

10:16.875 --> 10:20.042
Oh, yeah? What are you
going to do with your life?

10:20.333 --> 10:21.333
Like everyone.

10:27.458 --> 10:28.500
This isn't a gig!

10:28.583 --> 10:31.750
That's what I'm talking about,
making money.

10:31.833 --> 10:34.000
You see many millionaire receptionists?

10:34.083 --> 10:35.542
Some do very well.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.792
They're not millionaires.
Neither are you.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.250
Can't you see I'm trying to help you?

10:40.333 --> 10:43.042
Help us do what?
Become society's flunkeys?

10:43.125 --> 10:44.292
Rules are necessary.

10:44.375 --> 10:47.208
But you're too stubborn.
You don't want to learn.

10:47.292 --> 10:50.125
So you'll never achieve anything
in your life.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.542
Go and sit down.

10:52.708 --> 10:54.292
What have you achieved?

10:54.458 --> 10:58.083
What the fuck have you achieved?
Look at your clothes!

10:58.167 --> 11:00.208
Go to the principal. That's enough.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.500
What do you earn, 1,500 euros a month?

11:02.583 --> 11:04.875
-Thirteen hundred!
-Eight hundred for your rent.

11:04.958 --> 11:07.500
Three hundred for your shopping
at Leader Price.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.542
She can't afford organic!

11:09.958 --> 11:11.042
One hundred euros...

11:11.125 --> 11:14.500
One hundred for energy,
twenty for Internet...

11:14.583 --> 11:17.125
Your package holidays in Turkey...

11:17.208 --> 11:19.417
Get out of here! Get out!

11:19.500 --> 11:22.333
-Zilch left!
-When she gets to class...

11:22.417 --> 11:24.208
she's like this!

11:24.292 --> 11:26.000
Skint!

11:26.083 --> 11:29.083
I don't wanna beg. I've got my pride!

11:29.667 --> 11:31.500
Get out of my fucking class!

11:31.583 --> 11:34.417
I swear on my mother's life

11:34.500 --> 11:37.667
I'll make more cash
than you've ever dreamed of!

11:37.750 --> 11:39.167
In your entire life!

11:39.250 --> 11:41.625
Even in your wildest dreams!

11:41.708 --> 11:43.875
I'm never coming back
to this shit school!

11:43.958 --> 11:45.083
I'll show you!

12:07.250 --> 12:10.083
<i>I'm gonna kill her.</i>
<i>She's busting my balls.</i>

12:10.167 --> 12:11.375
<i>Come back.</i>

12:11.542 --> 12:12.958
<i>I love you too!</i>

12:13.042 --> 12:15.792
<i>Quitter!</i>

13:20.583 --> 13:22.875
Three vodka and oranges.

13:26.292 --> 13:28.375
Stop drinking.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.167
I'm going soon.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.042
In your dreams.

13:34.583 --> 13:37.083
I have to revise at Maimouna's.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.917
You're not exactly studying for a PhD!

13:42.000 --> 13:44.542
You can go to Maimouna's later.

13:45.208 --> 13:46.625
They go to bed early.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.583
Mum, the boss!

13:57.708 --> 13:58.875
Boss...

13:59.375 --> 14:01.125
you're so handsome!

14:01.708 --> 14:02.583
Where's my drink?

14:16.792 --> 14:18.000
Leave it.

14:18.750 --> 14:21.667
Look how radiant my daughter is.

14:22.083 --> 14:25.208
-Look how beautiful she is.
-Mum, you're embarrassing me!

14:25.292 --> 14:26.292
Stop it!

14:32.333 --> 14:34.083
Get out! Get out!

14:34.167 --> 14:35.583
-Out!
-What are you doing?

14:37.125 --> 14:39.500
Get off my mum! I mean it!

14:39.583 --> 14:41.375
I'm not joking, you pig!

14:41.583 --> 14:44.000
-Are you mad?
-Get out of here!

14:44.083 --> 14:47.208
I'll burn your fucking club down!

14:47.292 --> 14:49.625
You sick fucking pig!

14:49.708 --> 14:51.167
Don't come back!

14:51.250 --> 14:54.083
-I'll burn your club down!
-Don't come back!

14:56.292 --> 14:59.250
You shame me here, at home,
everywhere!

15:00.750 --> 15:02.792
This is work, so we can eat!

15:02.875 --> 15:05.167
Take your mother and go home!

15:06.667 --> 15:08.417
Mum, please behave!

15:11.750 --> 15:13.458
Do you do it on purpose?

15:54.875 --> 15:56.792
Hey, what are you watching?

15:56.875 --> 15:59.792
-Leave him.
-Look away!

16:00.708 --> 16:03.125
Let him look a bit.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.458
That's what nightclubs should be like.

16:05.542 --> 16:07.125
How much did you score?

16:07.208 --> 16:11.083
I was just there on holiday.
And I'm gonna go back to live.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.917
Thailand's in recession!

16:13.000 --> 16:16.125
Not in the sex business.
Sex tourism, she's right.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.792
No one cares about us.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.792
They let us live here like dogs.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.792
It's been like that for 2 years.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.375
Over there you can earn big.

16:24.458 --> 16:27.625
Sex, booze, drugs... Easy money!

16:27.708 --> 16:32.208
I'll open a bar with hookers
and party while making loads of money!

16:34.375 --> 16:36.375
I'll open a little bar,

16:36.458 --> 16:38.667
with a Thai guy, lots of masseuses...

16:38.750 --> 16:39.833
Sweet!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.875
You got it, girl!

17:13.292 --> 17:15.208
-You okay?
-Yeah.

17:15.958 --> 17:18.583
Hey, Alberto! Down, down!

17:19.750 --> 17:22.000
Here, pass it to me! Nutmeg!

17:22.792 --> 17:24.083
Bianca.

17:25.292 --> 17:27.583
All right?
I got some Nutella for you.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.083
Here.

17:31.292 --> 17:32.750
-Thanks.
-No problem.

17:34.958 --> 17:35.958
<i>Salam.</i>

17:36.042 --> 17:37.167
<i>Alaykumu salam.</i>

17:37.250 --> 17:40.500
How could he do that to me?
It's disgusting!

17:40.583 --> 17:42.375
Stop blubbering.

17:42.458 --> 17:43.833
No one's dead.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.083
Amin. Who's Amin?

17:46.167 --> 17:49.250
He's a man, that's all.
Disposable, like a Kleenex.

17:50.792 --> 17:53.208
If only he were handsome.
But he's ugly.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.375
I'm so stupid!

17:59.458 --> 18:01.292
He told me he loved me.

18:01.375 --> 18:02.542
Love?

18:03.375 --> 18:06.000
Men don't think with this,
but with this!

18:08.000 --> 18:12.125
Andrea goes to bed with Rita Hayworth
and wakes up with Coco the Clown!

18:15.250 --> 18:18.000
The more beautiful you are,
the more you suffer.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.792
Eat! Starving won't bring him back.

18:33.083 --> 18:34.708
I'll get the shower ready for you.

19:35.083 --> 19:37.167
-You okay?
-Yeah, and you?

19:38.208 --> 19:39.958
Haven't seen you around.

19:40.042 --> 19:42.167
I've been here, brother.

19:55.458 --> 19:58.708
-Were you asleep?
-Times are hard.

20:49.833 --> 20:51.333
What are you doing here?

20:52.583 --> 20:54.292
Shouldn't you be in school?

20:54.375 --> 20:56.042
I start at one o'clock today.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.417
Where's my daughter?

20:57.500 --> 20:59.917
Maimouna's in group A.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.708
You come to the mosque
when it's empty?

21:04.833 --> 21:08.208
Why don't you pray with us anymore?
You used to like it.

21:10.083 --> 21:12.583
I'd better go, or I'll be late.

21:13.167 --> 21:14.583
Take care of your mum.

21:14.667 --> 21:15.542
Okay.

21:15.625 --> 21:17.833
Paradise lies at the feet of your mother.

21:43.875 --> 21:44.875
Shit!

22:14.083 --> 22:16.042
What if we wake her up?

22:16.208 --> 22:17.875
Ring the bell, who cares?

22:29.375 --> 22:31.875
-Are you mental?
-She won't hear otherwise!

22:34.958 --> 22:36.292
Yeah?

22:38.583 --> 22:39.708
Is Rebecca in?

22:44.375 --> 22:46.000
Rebecca, for you.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.375
What?

22:54.042 --> 22:56.458
Can we talk alone? Please.

22:58.292 --> 22:59.167
Wait for me.

23:08.708 --> 23:09.750
Spit it out.

23:11.583 --> 23:12.917
We want to work for you.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.458
You think I'm the Job Centre?

23:15.542 --> 23:16.375
Piss off!

23:17.375 --> 23:19.708
With me, your dope would be safe.

23:23.708 --> 23:24.875
Come in.

23:29.042 --> 23:30.000
From Samir?

23:30.583 --> 23:31.583
You robbed him?

23:31.667 --> 23:33.625
No, he left it lying around.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.667
You robbed him to get a job with me?

23:38.083 --> 23:39.500
Does he know it was you?

23:43.375 --> 23:44.500
Nice.

23:46.375 --> 23:48.000
You got clitoris... Good!

23:51.000 --> 23:53.375
Come tomorrow.
I'll give you something to do.

24:13.208 --> 24:15.042
Go, "Shit, my mum!"

24:16.792 --> 24:17.833
Shit, my...

24:25.667 --> 24:27.375
Make it tighter.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.083
They're hitting themselves.

24:38.750 --> 24:40.167
The star's here!

24:40.750 --> 24:44.000
-What's the excuse this time?
-I got held up at work.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.292
Djigui, your work is here!

24:46.500 --> 24:48.167
It's the security dog.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.292
You don't have time to change.

24:50.375 --> 24:53.708
-It won't be easy like this.
-You want easy, go home.

24:53.792 --> 24:56.750
-Maybe you're not up to it.
-I wouldn't like that!

24:57.000 --> 24:59.625
-What did you say?
-I don't have time to talk.

24:59.708 --> 25:02.875
Not up to it?
I'm gonna burn up your audition!

25:03.375 --> 25:04.417
Burn it up?

25:04.500 --> 25:06.083
He's bigheaded!

25:06.583 --> 25:08.125
Wanker!

25:21.417 --> 25:24.000
That's not what I want.
Do my<i> </i>moves.

25:24.083 --> 25:25.000
Okay?

25:25.083 --> 25:27.500
It's an audition. You're not in yet.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.417
We've been coming for three weeks.

25:30.042 --> 25:31.375
And what's going on?

25:32.042 --> 25:34.792
I'm leading you
towards something different.

25:34.958 --> 25:36.708
What I see there isn't...

25:36.875 --> 25:37.917
Stop!

25:38.083 --> 25:41.333
Did I go to dance school
to study ballet?

25:41.417 --> 25:44.208
Did I ever tell you that I had?

25:44.292 --> 25:46.500
I danced in the street!

25:46.583 --> 25:50.083
I didn't have someone
sitting at a piano to teach me.

25:50.167 --> 25:52.792
This stuff we're doing isn't even organic!

25:52.875 --> 25:54.667
There's nothing going on!

25:55.083 --> 25:56.458
Can't you see?

25:57.083 --> 26:00.833
Why's he making such a fuss?
Just do the moves!

26:01.500 --> 26:04.792
"I'm from a tough estate..."
Yeah, right!

26:04.875 --> 26:08.083
The problem with you
is that you're afraid.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.583
-Afraid?
-Yes.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.500
-Afraid to come here?
-Yes.

26:11.583 --> 26:14.500
No, I'm not afraid.
I'm not scared of this.

26:14.583 --> 26:17.625
Then stop talking and just do it!

26:17.708 --> 26:18.917
Go on!

26:19.000 --> 26:21.583
If I were the choreographer,
I'd twat him.

26:21.667 --> 26:24.417
"If you don't like it, piss off!"

26:31.667 --> 26:32.958
Longer.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.625
Stretch out your arm.

26:41.667 --> 26:42.750
Longer.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.875
Like that, but more stretched out.

26:45.083 --> 26:48.208
Now that he's let himself go,
it's more fluid.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.875
He was as jerky as a lawnmower!

26:56.500 --> 26:57.458
Shit...

26:57.958 --> 27:00.792
He was taught a fucking lesson there!

27:03.875 --> 27:05.750
I'm gonna teach him a lesson too.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.958
-The first to spit on him...
-You're mental!

27:09.042 --> 27:10.500
What's wrong?

27:11.375 --> 27:13.167
-You chicken?
-No.

27:13.250 --> 27:15.208
-I can see it in your eyes.
-No way.

27:15.292 --> 27:17.875
-Then spit with me.
-Go on, then.

27:32.292 --> 27:34.208
-Not even close!
-Your turn.

27:37.875 --> 27:39.083
Yeah, got him!

27:39.583 --> 27:41.792
-Watch this.
-No, that's enough.

27:41.875 --> 27:44.083
Djigui, what are you doing?

27:46.833 --> 27:48.125
Who are you spitting at?

27:48.708 --> 27:51.083
Is that you doing that? You fucker!

27:51.167 --> 27:52.792
-Go, go!
-Wait there!

27:53.708 --> 27:54.667
Come back.

27:54.750 --> 27:56.000
I'm gonna kill you!

27:56.083 --> 27:57.625
Come back here!

27:57.708 --> 27:58.792
Djigui!

28:02.875 --> 28:03.750
Shit!

28:12.292 --> 28:14.125
Come here!

28:19.000 --> 28:20.500
I'm gonna fuck you up!

28:28.083 --> 28:29.375
Oh, shit!

28:30.083 --> 28:31.500
Djigui, come down!

28:33.333 --> 28:34.500
Stop it, Djigui!

28:34.583 --> 28:35.708
Stay there!

28:37.708 --> 28:39.708
Djigui, don't be stupid!

28:40.292 --> 28:41.750
He was right. You're scared.

28:44.375 --> 28:46.708
-No, Djigui!
-Ciao.

28:46.792 --> 28:48.417
Djigui, it's not worth it!

28:49.000 --> 28:50.083
Stay there!

28:50.792 --> 28:52.208
Don't go any further!

28:52.292 --> 28:53.583
Go on, faster!

28:55.750 --> 28:57.000
Go back!

28:58.417 --> 29:00.417
Stop it, this is stupid!

29:01.208 --> 29:02.417
Are you shaking?

29:07.750 --> 29:08.875
Help!

29:11.875 --> 29:13.583
Call security!

29:13.667 --> 29:14.708
Don't move!

29:15.708 --> 29:16.958
I'm slipping!

29:18.292 --> 29:19.583
Give me your hand.

29:19.875 --> 29:21.375
Get your feet on that.

29:26.292 --> 29:28.708
Now get your other foot on the bar.

29:29.042 --> 29:31.000
Push up with your foot!

29:31.083 --> 29:34.167
Don't look down, look at me.

29:34.250 --> 29:37.417
Look into my eyes
and push up on the bar.

29:43.167 --> 29:44.250
Okay.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.708
You can't fall now.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.625
What's the bastard doing here?

30:28.875 --> 30:31.042
Leave her alone, she's my girl.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.417
I have to pay you back for that dope?

30:34.500 --> 30:35.708
Of course you do.

30:35.792 --> 30:37.708
I thought we were like brothers.

30:37.792 --> 30:39.875
Cash is my only brother.

30:40.667 --> 30:43.000
-Cash is your only brother?
-That's right.

30:50.750 --> 30:52.292
Your shopping.

30:52.833 --> 30:54.917
You've hired all the local losers!

31:10.500 --> 31:11.375
Thanks.

31:12.250 --> 31:15.792
Twenty? I get more from shoplifting!

31:15.958 --> 31:17.833
-Thanks, later.
-Twenty!

31:17.917 --> 31:19.417
-What's your problem?
-Dounia!

31:20.000 --> 31:21.083
Come back.

31:24.958 --> 31:26.500
Can you ride a scooter?

31:28.167 --> 31:29.792
Of course.

31:31.708 --> 31:32.875
Outta the way!

31:32.958 --> 31:35.583
Move, move! You're in my way!

31:35.667 --> 31:38.375
It's not me getting in your<i> </i>way!

31:38.958 --> 31:42.000
You can't accelerate
and brake at the same time.

31:42.083 --> 31:43.292
This is what you're like...

31:46.375 --> 31:48.000
So you're a mechanic now?

31:48.083 --> 31:50.583
I'd forgotten that you were
Maimouna the Mechanic!

31:50.750 --> 31:51.708
Sorry!

31:51.792 --> 31:54.583
-There's broken glass there!
-I see it!

31:54.875 --> 31:56.000
Go on!

31:57.708 --> 32:01.292
-Can't you do a single circuit?
-You're doing my head in!

32:01.500 --> 32:03.292
Hold the handlebars right.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.708
I'm okay, don't touch me!
It's all your fault.

32:07.792 --> 32:10.292
-Why did you say you could?
-Because I can!

32:10.375 --> 32:11.667
-Yeah?
-Yeah!

32:12.167 --> 32:13.417
See you!

32:17.667 --> 32:20.083
Yeah, see what you made me do?

32:23.708 --> 32:24.667
Where are you going?

32:24.750 --> 32:26.917
I'm late. I'll be in trouble.

32:27.083 --> 32:29.500
You can't just leave me!

32:29.667 --> 32:32.000
It won't even start now!

32:32.083 --> 32:33.708
Whose fault is that?

32:38.083 --> 32:39.458
I've done it!

32:39.542 --> 32:42.208
Why keep trying?
You'll never get the hang of it!

32:46.667 --> 32:49.000
I do better when you're not here!

33:12.125 --> 33:14.292
About time! I could get raped here!

33:14.375 --> 33:15.792
"Eleven o'clock, on the dot."

33:15.875 --> 33:17.375
Yeah, okay.

33:21.542 --> 33:22.708
My foot!

33:25.042 --> 33:26.792
That way.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.292
Over here.

33:33.458 --> 33:34.583
Here.

33:37.458 --> 33:38.792
Quiet!

33:55.792 --> 33:59.000
It's to keep the jinns away.
I can feel them around us.

33:59.083 --> 34:03.125
They hide everywhere.
In rats, dogs, snakes...

34:03.208 --> 34:05.792
They don't like being disturbed.

34:46.958 --> 34:48.208
A jinn.

34:48.792 --> 34:50.083
A jinn.

34:52.583 --> 34:53.792
What you talking about?

34:54.000 --> 34:55.500
It's got into you.

34:55.708 --> 34:56.833
Shut up!

35:02.750 --> 35:05.458
The jinns don't like the full moon.

35:06.042 --> 35:07.708
It makes them mad.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.500
Doesn't it look like a face?

35:16.208 --> 35:17.500
It's God watching us.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.708
Like he's got nothing better to do!

35:21.250 --> 35:22.250
<i>Insha'Allah.</i>

35:22.333 --> 35:24.167
He could tell my dad everything.

35:25.375 --> 35:26.708
Don't worry.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.875
We're dust in the cosmos.
To him, we're microbes.

35:31.917 --> 35:33.750
But when you're God,

35:34.042 --> 35:37.125
you have to watch over your children.

35:37.208 --> 35:38.250
It's written.

35:38.833 --> 35:41.875
Yeah, but he hasn't acknowledged us.

35:45.083 --> 35:46.292
Yes, he has.

35:51.292 --> 35:53.417
He talks to me all the time.

35:54.208 --> 35:55.208
When?

35:58.208 --> 35:59.792
In my dreams.

36:03.167 --> 36:04.625
He gives me weird dreams.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.708
Don't you have weird dreams?

36:13.458 --> 36:15.458
Mine are always the same.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.458
I dream that I'm falling.

36:21.208 --> 36:23.042
I try hard to wake up...

36:24.292 --> 36:25.125
but I can't.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.458
I just keep falling.

36:31.292 --> 36:33.667
The further I fall, the more it burns.

36:37.542 --> 36:39.042
In the end,

36:40.667 --> 36:43.000
I'm no longer in pain or afraid.

36:45.958 --> 36:48.583
I just want to crash so it'll end.

36:49.667 --> 36:51.375
But it never does.

36:59.375 --> 37:00.792
What about me?

37:02.042 --> 37:03.667
I'm always here to catch you.

37:19.583 --> 37:20.958
-Here.
-Thanks.

37:24.792 --> 37:26.292
I put everything in the cellar.

37:29.167 --> 37:31.667
Keep them.
You're in charge of the petrol now.

37:35.958 --> 37:37.708
Where do you and your mum live?

37:42.000 --> 37:43.667
The Roma camp, with my aunt.

37:45.708 --> 37:47.583
By the A3 motorway?

37:47.958 --> 37:50.000
You'll catch tetanus there.

37:54.375 --> 37:55.792
So I can find you there?

38:01.667 --> 38:03.250
I'm putting you and Maimouna
in action.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.500
You'll take Samir's patch.

38:09.667 --> 38:10.667
Use this.

38:11.292 --> 38:13.417
If there's any problem,
destroy the SIM card.

38:14.417 --> 38:16.750
It's got fake names,
my number and Samir's.

38:16.833 --> 38:19.042
But don't call me. I'll call you.

38:22.208 --> 38:23.250
Here.

38:24.917 --> 38:25.875
A present.

38:28.208 --> 38:30.458
No way, it's an iPhone 6 Plus!

38:31.500 --> 38:32.458
See you tomorrow.

38:36.958 --> 38:38.500
Why're you spoiling her?

38:41.542 --> 38:43.583
And so...

38:45.167 --> 38:47.500
-Which ones?
-Supras, they're essential.

38:47.583 --> 38:49.000
I'll get Supras,

38:49.083 --> 38:50.667
I'll get Gazelles,

38:50.750 --> 38:52.208
I'll get Reeboks...

38:52.292 --> 38:53.500
I'm gonna get

38:53.583 --> 38:56.292
the two Adidas there...
That's for sure.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.542
Navy blue and grey.

38:58.250 --> 39:00.708
Maybe some Reeboks, just for home.

39:00.792 --> 39:03.167
Let's go and eat
at the supermarket.

39:04.167 --> 39:06.292
-It's the monkey.
-Our pal!

39:09.708 --> 39:11.292
Where are you going?

39:11.792 --> 39:13.792
Why are you stopping us
from coming in?

39:13.875 --> 39:15.333
You're not coming in.

39:18.542 --> 39:20.833
I saved your life
and this is how you thank me?

39:21.375 --> 39:23.458
Okay... Noted.

39:24.583 --> 39:25.458
Djigui...

39:25.542 --> 39:27.167
Where's your tutu?

39:27.250 --> 39:29.625
-And your tights?
-Don't touch me!

39:30.292 --> 39:31.792
My little ballerina!

39:32.375 --> 39:34.500
Cut it out!
What's going on?

39:35.458 --> 39:36.625
Are you flirting?

39:38.083 --> 39:40.000
You're not coming in, cockroaches!

39:40.083 --> 39:42.042
-I need tampons.
-Clear off!

39:42.292 --> 39:43.875
No arguing!

39:44.083 --> 39:46.292
What's going on here?

39:46.500 --> 39:48.500
Are you working or on the pull?

39:49.792 --> 39:51.458
Piss off, you little sluts!

39:51.958 --> 39:53.625
Dance back to your estate!

39:53.708 --> 39:55.375
One, two, three...

40:03.792 --> 40:05.708
Maimouna, every 15 minutes,

40:05.792 --> 40:09.375
you walk all the way around
to see if there's a patrol coming.

40:10.583 --> 40:13.375
Drug squad are always
in a black Citroën C4,

40:13.583 --> 40:15.500
a blue Ford Focus,

40:15.667 --> 40:18.208
or a Peugeot 308.
Keep your eyes peeled.

40:18.375 --> 40:19.500
Hey, pal!

40:20.250 --> 40:22.083
How's it going? The family?

40:22.708 --> 40:25.000
They're my girls, replacing Samir.

40:32.875 --> 40:34.458
Watch that motherfucker!

40:34.542 --> 40:37.125
He tries to nick all my punters.

40:37.208 --> 40:39.375
Cover Dounia
when she goes down to the cellar.

40:47.792 --> 40:49.958
I don't want any fuss.

40:51.375 --> 40:54.208
Any trouble,
I don't know you, you don't know me.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.625
We should do a Snapchat story,

41:27.708 --> 41:29.750
or no one'll know we're selling.

41:30.208 --> 41:32.208
Stop it! We're in with Rebecca now.

41:32.292 --> 41:34.458
The cash'll start pouring in!

41:34.958 --> 41:37.292
All we're getting here is bored!

41:37.792 --> 41:39.625
Try to look ahead a bit.

41:40.583 --> 41:43.792
Just imagine, we're in Phuket...

41:47.292 --> 41:48.875
Blue sky,

41:49.083 --> 41:51.500
turquoise sea, sunshine...

41:52.042 --> 41:54.583
Ferrari, my Ferrari!

41:56.500 --> 41:57.625
Come on.

41:57.792 --> 41:58.875
You go.

41:59.458 --> 42:00.708
You're not coming?

42:00.875 --> 42:02.875
Okay, I'll go without you.

42:03.208 --> 42:04.083
Wait.

42:08.667 --> 42:09.875
There, I'm in.

42:10.083 --> 42:11.500
Put your Ray-Bans on.

42:22.458 --> 42:23.500
Yeah or what?

42:23.583 --> 42:25.375
-Do I put my seat belt on?
-Yeah.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.708
We're off!

42:33.875 --> 42:36.375
The wind in our hair. We slay!

42:36.458 --> 42:38.875
Such a beautiful day.

42:40.583 --> 42:43.458
Not enough hair
for it to blow in the wind!

42:43.542 --> 42:44.792
Never mind.

42:48.083 --> 42:50.042
Shit, watch your speed!

42:50.375 --> 42:52.375
-Don't worry.
-Take the bend!

42:54.792 --> 42:56.500
Watch out in front!

42:56.583 --> 42:58.000
Wait, wait, wait!

42:58.583 --> 43:00.250
Watch out, watch out!

43:01.583 --> 43:03.667
-And straighten up.
-Nice one.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.750
Hang on...

43:07.792 --> 43:09.625
Watch out!

43:09.708 --> 43:12.917
A big blond guy
with a gorgeous booty.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.625
Six foot tall and hot!

43:14.708 --> 43:16.917
He's yours. He's noticed us.

43:17.000 --> 43:20.083
Colgate smile, a six-pack...

43:20.167 --> 43:21.500
Blow him a kiss.

43:23.375 --> 43:24.875
Slap his booty!

43:25.375 --> 43:27.042
He likes it. Get in.

43:27.500 --> 43:28.958
We said get in!

43:30.958 --> 43:32.000
Let's drive.

43:32.167 --> 43:33.583
And we're driving.

43:33.667 --> 43:35.667
-Some music?
-Some music.

43:37.292 --> 43:38.708
We're at the villa.

43:38.792 --> 43:40.708
It's heaving!

43:40.792 --> 43:42.792
Splash your cash around!

43:48.875 --> 43:49.792
Present!

43:49.875 --> 43:51.792
Hey, don't touch the windscreen!

43:52.208 --> 43:53.083
Champagne!

46:29.583 --> 46:30.667
I know you're there.

46:37.792 --> 46:39.125
I can smell you.

47:18.542 --> 47:20.500
Fuck, a punter.

47:23.583 --> 47:25.792
-What do we do?
-Keep cool.

47:33.375 --> 47:34.875
You seen Samir?

47:35.250 --> 47:36.708
We're Samir.

47:37.792 --> 47:39.292
What do you mean?

47:40.250 --> 47:43.042
We're Samir. Do you want something?

47:44.375 --> 47:45.542
For twenty?

47:49.292 --> 47:50.375
Keep an eye out.

47:55.542 --> 47:56.750
Got the cash?

47:56.833 --> 47:58.208
Here.

48:06.167 --> 48:08.625
-What are you doing?
-Give me my money back!

48:08.708 --> 48:11.625
What are you doing?

48:15.292 --> 48:17.750
Open your mouth!
Give me my money!

48:18.208 --> 48:19.292
You think I'm a bitch?

48:20.292 --> 48:22.083
What did I tell you?

48:22.375 --> 48:23.792
Give me my money!

48:25.750 --> 48:27.417
You're messing with Rebecca!

48:27.500 --> 48:29.500
Do you wanna mess with Rebecca?

48:31.958 --> 48:34.000
Take your shit dope!

48:34.167 --> 48:35.000
Give me my money.

48:35.083 --> 48:36.375
Get outta here!

48:37.458 --> 48:40.042
-Give me my money.
-No, you deal with Rebecca now.

49:39.000 --> 49:40.000
Dounia!

49:45.000 --> 49:46.542
Fuck, what did he do to you?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.083
Listen.

49:48.542 --> 49:49.583
Look.

49:51.875 --> 49:53.042
There's no one.

49:55.042 --> 49:57.042
What the fuck did he do to you?

49:58.708 --> 49:59.958
Easy.

50:00.292 --> 50:02.667
-Gently.
-It's not broken.

50:04.500 --> 50:05.792
You did good.

50:13.083 --> 50:14.083
Fuck!

50:14.167 --> 50:15.958
I can't let my mum see me like this.

50:19.708 --> 50:21.333
You can sleep here if you like.

50:23.167 --> 50:25.875
Thanks, but I have to get back.

50:40.583 --> 50:42.375
Your hair's really long.

50:43.708 --> 50:45.000
Why don't you wear it down?

50:47.500 --> 50:49.583
You could be beautiful.

50:52.292 --> 50:54.583
You don't realise, you're still a kid.

50:55.083 --> 50:56.500
I'm not a kid anymore.

51:16.958 --> 51:19.667
Those two marks there are his eyes.

51:21.000 --> 51:22.042
Hit hard!

51:26.292 --> 51:27.542
Go!

51:29.792 --> 51:30.708
I can't.

51:30.792 --> 51:32.083
Go on!

51:33.375 --> 51:35.583
Again! That's it, go for it!

52:13.917 --> 52:14.833
What's that?

52:14.917 --> 52:16.083
For me?

52:16.167 --> 52:17.375
A present.

52:17.458 --> 52:18.792
Where's it from?

52:18.875 --> 52:21.875
-A collection at the mosque.
-For us?

52:21.958 --> 52:23.792
Is it Christmas at the mosque?

52:24.833 --> 52:26.500
This is for the rent.

52:28.708 --> 52:30.000
Where's this money from?

52:30.083 --> 52:31.750
I told you, a collection.

52:31.833 --> 52:33.542
Cartier, from a collection?

52:34.875 --> 52:38.375
Stop worrying.
Make the most of it.

52:38.458 --> 52:41.583
Here, let me smell it.

52:42.292 --> 52:43.500
Swear it's true.

52:43.583 --> 52:45.000
I swear.

52:47.583 --> 52:48.667
I love you!

53:48.458 --> 53:51.375
Lord, forgive me.

54:15.083 --> 54:16.208
Hey, you!

54:16.292 --> 54:17.708
Where's my money?

54:17.875 --> 54:19.708
I don't have time for this.

54:22.583 --> 54:24.875
-I can't get that move.
-Who cares?

54:24.958 --> 54:27.750
-You try it.
-I'm not interested!

54:30.083 --> 54:32.542
Why do you watch me for hours, then?

54:34.000 --> 54:35.208
See...

54:35.375 --> 54:37.000
you haven't got it yet.

54:39.375 --> 54:41.250
Let go... Let go!

54:46.583 --> 54:47.792
What's your game?

54:47.875 --> 54:50.375
Now what will you do?
That all you got?

55:03.250 --> 55:04.500
Where are you going?

55:04.875 --> 55:06.292
That turns you on, right?

55:20.458 --> 55:22.167
You think I left it here?

55:25.667 --> 55:27.042
What are you doing?

55:27.458 --> 55:28.625
Let go of me!

55:28.708 --> 55:30.500
Let go, I'm not playing around!

55:31.708 --> 55:32.792
You're beautiful.

55:37.583 --> 55:39.042
Let go of my hair!

55:39.375 --> 55:40.583
I'm not joking.

55:40.958 --> 55:42.083
Let go!

55:54.583 --> 55:56.750
What do you think?
Am I getting there?

56:08.000 --> 56:09.875
Getting spruced up
for the concierge?

56:10.875 --> 56:14.042
Busted, Jacky! I knew it!

56:17.292 --> 56:19.292
-What are you doing?
-I'm in pain.

56:19.375 --> 56:20.917
I don't care, get up!

56:21.000 --> 56:23.917
-I can't do it.
-I don't care, get up!

56:24.000 --> 56:26.042
-She should wear...
-Shut it and chop!

56:26.792 --> 56:29.167
Do it with the kebab box
on your head.

56:29.250 --> 56:33.583
The police never stop a woman in heels.
So keep trying.

56:33.667 --> 56:36.375
I'm not doing it just to be nasty.

56:36.458 --> 56:38.167
Come on, faster!

56:38.250 --> 56:39.667
For fuck's sake!

56:42.875 --> 56:44.458
Why do the poor stay poor?

56:45.042 --> 56:47.042
Because the rich take it all.

56:47.125 --> 56:48.667
No, because the poor don't dare.

56:48.750 --> 56:53.750
You have to dare to be rich.
Visualise the money and it'll come.

56:53.833 --> 56:55.792
I just visualise it, and it'll come?

56:55.875 --> 56:57.417
Yes, money is an energy.

56:57.500 --> 56:58.458
It's a flow.

56:58.542 --> 57:00.875
You have to demand it.
"I dare to be rich."

57:00.958 --> 57:03.208
I dare to be rich!

57:03.292 --> 57:06.042
I dare to be rich!

57:06.125 --> 57:10.750
Why are we torturing ourselves?
We don't have to do anything.

57:10.833 --> 57:12.792
What are you, a beggar?

57:12.875 --> 57:15.500
Never lose sight of the money.

57:15.583 --> 57:17.000
Do everything to get it.

57:17.083 --> 57:18.958
You, walk and visualise.

57:19.042 --> 57:21.375
You, chop and visualise.

57:22.042 --> 57:26.083
If you can walk in heels,
we'll make 100 grand, easy!

57:28.375 --> 57:29.250
A hundred grand?

57:30.000 --> 57:32.708
-She'll get 100 grand?
-Of course.

57:32.792 --> 57:34.792
Gotta use your brain.

57:35.292 --> 57:36.333
Fetch the iPad.

57:49.375 --> 57:50.875
-Who's that?
-Reda.

57:51.083 --> 57:53.625
My old supplier,
grassed me to the filth.

57:54.208 --> 57:55.292
Fucker!

57:55.375 --> 57:56.708
He's paranoid.

57:56.792 --> 57:58.500
He'd suspect his own mum.

57:58.583 --> 58:03.208
One night, he was totally out of it
and told me where he keeps his cash.

58:03.292 --> 58:05.833
One hundred thousand euros,
always in his flat.

58:07.500 --> 58:09.792
You're gonna get it for me.

58:16.875 --> 58:18.042
How?

58:18.250 --> 58:19.375
With your heels.

58:19.875 --> 58:21.625
He won't be able to resist you.

58:21.708 --> 58:24.000
Hot chicks are his weakness.

58:24.792 --> 58:27.083
He won't even notice me.
Look at them!

58:27.292 --> 58:28.417
They're whores.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.792
But you look different.

58:32.542 --> 58:34.208
He has to take you to his flat.

58:36.542 --> 58:38.083
Guys are like dogs.

58:38.250 --> 58:40.458
They smell fear, they eat you up.

58:41.167 --> 58:42.625
You look scared a lot.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.458
No, I'm not scared.

58:47.875 --> 58:48.917
See, you're scared.

58:49.000 --> 58:50.833
Because you're scary!

58:51.250 --> 58:52.792
It's in the eyes.

58:53.208 --> 58:54.417
The far-away look.

59:08.792 --> 59:10.667
Are you scared? Yes or no?

59:12.167 --> 59:13.125
Open your mouth.

59:13.208 --> 59:14.625
Open your fucking mouth!

59:18.333 --> 59:19.500
Stop it!

59:19.583 --> 59:22.500
-What are you doing?
-Want me to blow your brains out?

59:23.083 --> 59:24.208
To waste you?

59:26.667 --> 59:28.208
Are you scared or not?

59:38.833 --> 59:39.875
You strike!

59:40.583 --> 59:42.083
Then you caress.

59:46.583 --> 59:49.458
I couldn't even fit one tit
into this top.

59:50.792 --> 59:52.083
It's tiny!

59:52.875 --> 59:54.417
I could go like this.

59:54.500 --> 59:55.708
Fit right in!

59:56.083 --> 59:57.292
I come along...

59:57.792 --> 59:59.125
Inspection, sir.

59:59.708 --> 1:00:02.292
I hear there's 100,000 euros hidden here.

1:00:02.792 --> 1:00:04.458
Don't try it on with me!

1:00:04.542 --> 1:00:07.667
A hundred grand, a hundred grand...

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.250
-You don't fool me.
-He'll run a mile!

1:00:16.583 --> 1:00:18.042
Come on, Reda.

1:00:18.583 --> 1:00:20.542
You fancy me, admit it.

1:00:22.083 --> 1:00:23.583
Stop it.

1:00:24.292 --> 1:00:25.792
Come on, just a little kiss.

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:49.000
What you doing?

1:00:49.583 --> 1:00:51.625
You're getting too cocky, bastard.

1:00:51.708 --> 1:00:52.833
Don't call me that!

1:00:52.917 --> 1:00:54.833
You think you're in daddy's car,
or what?

1:00:56.708 --> 1:01:00.208
You're screwed with Rebecca.
If I say we have the top down...

1:01:00.292 --> 1:01:01.458
We have the top down!

1:01:01.542 --> 1:01:02.542
Drive!

1:01:54.375 --> 1:01:55.250
Do you see him?

1:01:55.958 --> 1:01:57.167
No.

1:01:57.250 --> 1:01:59.250
Too many baldies!

1:02:01.375 --> 1:02:03.417
The champagne's flowing! Wicked!

1:02:06.500 --> 1:02:07.792
Hot bitches here!

1:02:07.875 --> 1:02:10.708
Almost showing their minges.
I'm shocked!

1:02:16.583 --> 1:02:18.042
There he is.

1:02:18.583 --> 1:02:19.458
Look.

1:02:19.958 --> 1:02:21.583
Fuck!

1:02:22.208 --> 1:02:23.625
The way he's holding her,

1:02:23.708 --> 1:02:25.292
the dirty old man!

1:02:47.375 --> 1:02:48.417
Stop it!

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:49.792
Wiggle your bum!

1:02:53.250 --> 1:02:55.875
-He'll never notice you.
-Leave me alone!

1:03:11.708 --> 1:03:12.917
You're mental!

1:04:14.083 --> 1:04:15.875
I don't believe it.

1:04:16.250 --> 1:04:19.042
He was looking at you like this...

1:04:20.042 --> 1:04:21.667
I swear.

1:04:21.750 --> 1:04:24.000
He lost interest in all the others.

1:04:24.167 --> 1:04:26.792
He eyed you up
like a Big Mac during Ramadan.

1:04:26.958 --> 1:04:27.958
Where's Samir?

1:04:29.083 --> 1:04:30.042
What?

1:04:30.667 --> 1:04:32.292
We told him here.

1:04:32.458 --> 1:04:34.292
Maybe he's on the other side.

1:04:35.375 --> 1:04:37.792
No, he's not. We said to wait here.

1:04:38.792 --> 1:04:40.500
Call him, he can't be far.

1:04:44.792 --> 1:04:45.667
No answer.

1:04:47.292 --> 1:04:49.792
It's 3:00 a.m. My mum'll kill me!

1:04:49.875 --> 1:04:51.250
Don't worry.

1:04:51.333 --> 1:04:54.583
Don't worry? Let's find a taxi.

1:05:23.042 --> 1:05:25.208
-Do you love me?
-Of course.

1:05:25.292 --> 1:05:27.000
You like that, eh?

1:05:27.792 --> 1:05:29.583
You are hot!

1:05:38.875 --> 1:05:40.792
What you doing with my mum?

1:05:40.875 --> 1:05:42.375
What? You<i> </i>fucked me!

1:05:43.625 --> 1:05:44.792
So I fucked your mum!

1:05:44.875 --> 1:05:47.375
What are you gonna do about it?

1:05:47.458 --> 1:05:48.958
Put that down!

1:05:49.042 --> 1:05:51.500
You wanna hit me? Go ahead!

1:05:51.583 --> 1:05:53.125
You had it coming, bastard!

1:05:53.208 --> 1:05:54.583
What's got into you?

1:05:56.667 --> 1:05:59.500
-What's got into you?
-Don't talk to your mother like that!

1:05:59.583 --> 1:06:01.583
Shagging that piece of shit!

1:06:02.083 --> 1:06:04.167
What the fuck got into you?

1:06:04.250 --> 1:06:05.667
If I want to screw, I screw!

1:06:05.750 --> 1:06:09.083
You're never here,
now you show up and lecture me?

1:06:09.167 --> 1:06:10.208
Fucking hell!

1:06:10.292 --> 1:06:12.083
When will you understand?

1:06:12.167 --> 1:06:13.875
Because of you I'm the bastard!

1:06:13.958 --> 1:06:16.583
My whole life
I've been called the bastard!

1:06:16.667 --> 1:06:18.708
I've done nothing wrong!

1:06:36.875 --> 1:06:39.917
-What's going on?
-Grab a jerry can.

1:06:48.583 --> 1:06:49.792
What are you doing?

1:06:51.542 --> 1:06:53.417
You're mad! Whose car's that?

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.500
Samir's mum's!

1:06:57.875 --> 1:06:59.000
Scumbag!

1:06:59.083 --> 1:07:00.583
Now I'm fucking you!

1:07:29.500 --> 1:07:30.542
A little selfie.

1:07:32.542 --> 1:07:35.042
She's mental. I can't take any more.

1:07:39.083 --> 1:07:40.667
The fuckers!

1:07:42.167 --> 1:07:43.583
Go on, film me.

1:07:45.667 --> 1:07:46.750
What are you doing?

1:07:47.875 --> 1:07:49.208
Perfect.

1:07:51.042 --> 1:07:53.125
Leave those cars alone!

1:07:56.542 --> 1:07:58.833
-Fuck!
-What are you doing?

1:07:59.458 --> 1:08:00.583
I'm talking to you!

1:08:00.667 --> 1:08:02.667
Let them burn!

1:08:04.583 --> 1:08:05.625
It's Dounia!

1:08:07.958 --> 1:08:09.167
It's Dounia!

1:08:13.375 --> 1:08:14.708
Grab some rocks!

1:08:15.292 --> 1:08:17.375
What are you gonna do?

1:08:17.458 --> 1:08:20.708
What are you gonna do?
Yeah, I'm here!

1:08:20.792 --> 1:08:23.375
Hey, let's play police tag!

1:08:23.958 --> 1:08:24.958
No!

1:08:26.292 --> 1:08:28.292
Get going, Maimouna!

1:08:33.917 --> 1:08:35.292
<i>Let's go, Maimouna!</i>

1:08:38.292 --> 1:08:39.708
<i>The fuckers are behind us!</i>

1:08:40.292 --> 1:08:41.583
Faster, faster!

1:08:43.542 --> 1:08:45.250
The police are after us!

1:08:46.042 --> 1:08:47.750
Smile for the camera!

1:08:53.583 --> 1:08:55.792
<i>Go, Maimouna!</i>

1:08:57.625 --> 1:08:58.583
<i>Faster!</i>

1:09:05.875 --> 1:09:07.792
What are you doing? Slow down!

1:09:08.542 --> 1:09:10.250
What the fuck are you doing?

1:09:12.875 --> 1:09:13.708
Get off me!

1:09:14.292 --> 1:09:15.500
Get the fuck off me!

1:09:15.583 --> 1:09:16.500
Don't touch me!

1:09:17.208 --> 1:09:18.917
-Don't touch me!
-Stop it!

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:20.583
I can't breathe!

1:09:20.667 --> 1:09:23.958
Let go of me! Let me go!
Are you mad? Maimouna!

1:09:24.042 --> 1:09:25.208
Shut up!

1:09:25.708 --> 1:09:28.208
What am I to do with you?

1:09:28.292 --> 1:09:30.458
I'm ashamed of you!

1:09:30.542 --> 1:09:33.417
I'm always ashamed!
You don't even know what dignity is.

1:09:33.500 --> 1:09:34.875
Or reputation.

1:09:34.958 --> 1:09:36.375
-The whole neighbourhood...
-Easy.

1:09:36.458 --> 1:09:37.792
Clear off, you!

1:09:37.875 --> 1:09:39.917
You're not even ashamed!

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.583
It's all because of you
that we're in this shit!

1:09:44.500 --> 1:09:46.958
I'm sick to death of you, too!

1:09:47.042 --> 1:09:50.000
You've had no time to raise her,
slut that you are!

1:09:50.083 --> 1:09:52.417
Don't come near my daughter again!

1:09:52.583 --> 1:09:54.792
Move it! Look at you!

1:10:17.375 --> 1:10:18.667
Where are you going?

1:10:19.250 --> 1:10:22.125
You're sober for once,
you can find your way home.

1:10:23.083 --> 1:10:24.792
-Don't...
-Let go of me!

1:10:25.875 --> 1:10:27.875
When did you become a mother?

1:10:28.167 --> 1:10:30.292
Please, Dounia, I'm sorry.

1:10:30.500 --> 1:10:32.000
I know I've messed up,

1:10:32.167 --> 1:10:34.292
but I'm going to change.

1:10:34.583 --> 1:10:37.625
I'll be a good mother to you.
Please, sweetheart!

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.708
Please stay with me. Please...

1:10:49.750 --> 1:10:52.167
No, Dounia! Stay!

1:10:53.042 --> 1:10:55.292
Please stay with me!

1:10:55.375 --> 1:10:57.708
-Drive.
-Don't go with them!

1:10:57.792 --> 1:10:59.208
Get out of the car.

1:10:59.292 --> 1:11:01.625
Leave my daughter alone!

1:11:01.708 --> 1:11:02.875
Dounia!

1:11:03.167 --> 1:11:06.000
Stay with me,
stay with your mum.

1:11:06.792 --> 1:11:07.958
I won't let you go!

1:11:08.042 --> 1:11:09.708
Leave her alone!

1:11:10.042 --> 1:11:11.083
Dounia!

1:11:11.167 --> 1:11:13.792
-Get out of the car!
-Speed up.

1:11:14.292 --> 1:11:15.792
Get out!

1:11:19.667 --> 1:11:23.542
Seeing your mum, I understand
why your head's so fucked up.

1:11:23.625 --> 1:11:25.292
Why'd you play police tag?

1:11:26.292 --> 1:11:27.792
What have I taught you?

1:11:27.875 --> 1:11:29.208
Keep a low profile.

1:11:29.292 --> 1:11:30.667
You have a record now.

1:11:30.750 --> 1:11:33.500
Do you want to ruin my business?

1:11:33.583 --> 1:11:34.958
I warned you about her.

1:11:35.042 --> 1:11:37.583
Give me the keys to the cellar.
Give them to me!

1:11:37.667 --> 1:11:40.375
-I'll make it right.
-Shut your mouth!

1:11:41.042 --> 1:11:43.625
The estate's crawling with cops
because of you.

1:11:43.708 --> 1:11:44.750
The keys!

1:11:46.250 --> 1:11:47.292
Here.

1:11:48.250 --> 1:11:49.833
He fucked my mum!

1:11:49.917 --> 1:11:51.125
Everyone has!

1:11:51.208 --> 1:11:53.250
Everyone's fucked your mother!

1:11:58.583 --> 1:11:59.583
Stop.

1:12:00.250 --> 1:12:01.458
Fucking stop!

1:12:02.208 --> 1:12:03.458
I'll pay you back.

1:12:03.542 --> 1:12:04.917
I swear I'll pay you back.

1:12:05.917 --> 1:12:07.292
Get the fuck outta here!

1:12:08.458 --> 1:12:09.292
Drive.

1:12:14.625 --> 1:12:17.042
It's been an honour working with you.

1:12:17.208 --> 1:12:18.958
This part is less pleasant

1:12:19.042 --> 1:12:21.958
because I have to decide.
I can't take everyone.

1:12:22.042 --> 1:12:24.708
That was the deal from the start.

1:12:24.792 --> 1:12:26.167
Hey, Djigui!

1:12:26.250 --> 1:12:27.708
On your feet!

1:12:27.792 --> 1:12:29.708
My girlfriend, she forgot her keys.

1:12:30.583 --> 1:12:31.542
Her again!

1:12:31.625 --> 1:12:34.625
-No games!
-This is the last audition...

1:12:34.708 --> 1:12:36.167
I don't give a toss!

1:12:36.250 --> 1:12:38.667
I want my money back.

1:12:38.750 --> 1:12:41.292
-Not if you keep shouting.
-You're sick!

1:12:42.083 --> 1:12:43.875
Sit down and watch me.

1:12:45.292 --> 1:12:46.875
Enjoy the show.

1:12:47.292 --> 1:12:48.958
Then I might give it back.

1:12:50.292 --> 1:12:52.042
I'm sure you'll bring me luck.

1:12:52.125 --> 1:12:53.958
Djigui, we're waiting for you.

1:12:54.042 --> 1:12:55.208
Feisty!

1:12:55.292 --> 1:12:56.458
That'll do.

1:13:00.792 --> 1:13:01.708
Right...

1:13:01.792 --> 1:13:04.333
Last piece of advice: be yourself.

1:13:40.875 --> 1:13:41.958
You liked it, eh?

1:13:44.125 --> 1:13:46.542
-Kind of.
-I saw you, you liked it.

1:13:47.375 --> 1:13:49.333
I don't have time for this.
You got my cash?

1:13:53.542 --> 1:13:54.500
I was picked.

1:13:55.875 --> 1:13:57.042
Picked for what?

1:13:57.125 --> 1:13:58.417
For the show.

1:13:58.875 --> 1:14:00.958
The lead role, for the tour.

1:14:03.583 --> 1:14:06.125
You can't imagine
how my life'll change.

1:14:08.292 --> 1:14:10.583
Great. You're not taking my money.

1:14:17.500 --> 1:14:18.542
Here.

1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:22.125
I didn't steal any of it.

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:24.875
I just wanted to lure you down.

1:14:27.417 --> 1:14:29.583
Can we meet?

1:14:30.458 --> 1:14:32.250
I got you a ticket for Saturday night.

1:14:34.583 --> 1:14:36.125
As my guest.

1:14:36.750 --> 1:14:38.083
Because you bring me luck.

1:14:40.792 --> 1:14:42.833
How long did you think
I'd chase after you?

1:14:44.542 --> 1:14:45.833
I don't even know your name.

1:14:48.042 --> 1:14:48.958
Tough.

1:14:52.375 --> 1:14:53.583
Hang on...

1:14:54.292 --> 1:14:56.292
-Aren't you hungry?
-No.

1:15:01.167 --> 1:15:02.458
M&Ms.

1:15:04.375 --> 1:15:05.792
Popcorn.

1:15:08.792 --> 1:15:10.583
Not hungry, then?

1:15:11.500 --> 1:15:13.167
Want to slow down a bit?

1:15:13.542 --> 1:15:15.792
Is this where you always bring
girls you want to shag?

1:15:18.792 --> 1:15:19.792
Only you.

1:15:19.958 --> 1:15:22.000
The others aren't such hard work.

1:15:42.875 --> 1:15:44.208
Shall we go?

1:16:48.458 --> 1:16:50.875
You think it's weird,
a guy who dances?

1:16:56.750 --> 1:16:58.125
When I dance...

1:16:59.083 --> 1:17:01.458
I let everything around me
come inside.

1:17:01.792 --> 1:17:03.208
And I don't cheat.

1:17:08.500 --> 1:17:10.125
Dance doesn't lie.

1:17:13.167 --> 1:17:14.583
It's sacred.

1:17:52.250 --> 1:17:53.958
What's your name?

1:17:57.750 --> 1:18:00.292
Won't you tell me?

1:18:04.208 --> 1:18:06.875
I won't let you go until you tell me.

1:18:09.250 --> 1:18:10.583
Tell me.

1:18:13.542 --> 1:18:15.167
Tell me your name.

1:18:15.875 --> 1:18:17.167
Stop!

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:20.000
-Tell me.
-Stop!

1:18:20.083 --> 1:18:22.125
Dounia... Dounia!

1:18:24.458 --> 1:18:26.542
My name is Dounia!

1:18:39.583 --> 1:18:42.292
I don't know what you did...

1:18:42.458 --> 1:18:44.667
to that motherfucker Reda.
Get in!

1:18:45.250 --> 1:18:47.833
-He was looking for you at the club.
-How's life, Jacky?

1:18:48.750 --> 1:18:49.958
Here, call him.

1:18:54.792 --> 1:18:55.792
Yeah.

1:18:55.875 --> 1:18:58.000
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Yeah, it's Zohra.

1:18:58.083 --> 1:18:59.167
<i>Zohra,</i>

1:18:59.250 --> 1:19:00.208
<i>my princess!</i>

1:19:00.292 --> 1:19:01.542
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

1:19:02.125 --> 1:19:03.417
<i>What are you doing Saturday?</i>

1:19:04.250 --> 1:19:07.458
<i>Fancy going to a gig?</i>
<i>A shit-hot new rap group.</i>

1:19:09.458 --> 1:19:10.708
I got stuff to do.

1:19:11.667 --> 1:19:14.417
What are you doing?
Getting your revenge?

1:19:14.500 --> 1:19:17.458
-You said to strike.
-And then caress!

1:19:18.875 --> 1:19:20.292
<i>Are you there, Zohra?</i>

1:19:20.792 --> 1:19:21.667
Yeah.

1:19:24.167 --> 1:19:26.000
<i>I'd really like to see you.</i>

1:19:26.875 --> 1:19:30.167
<i>Those other girls</i>
<i>were my mates' slags.</i>

1:19:31.792 --> 1:19:33.375
Okay, you're on.

1:19:33.458 --> 1:19:36.000
<i>Saturday at 7:00.</i>
<i>I'll text you the address.</i>

1:19:36.167 --> 1:19:37.333
Okay, ciao.

1:19:37.917 --> 1:19:39.583
Stop sulking.

1:19:40.375 --> 1:19:42.125
I know I'm hard on you.

1:19:42.292 --> 1:19:43.708
I know I made it tough.

1:19:43.792 --> 1:19:46.000
But it's because you've got potential.

1:19:46.458 --> 1:19:47.792
You've proved it.

1:19:50.750 --> 1:19:51.792
Here.

1:19:52.875 --> 1:19:53.750
Your money.

1:19:55.708 --> 1:19:57.250
That's peanuts.

1:19:58.167 --> 1:20:00.625
We'll have that fucker Reda,
eh, Jacky?

1:20:01.125 --> 1:20:02.583
Yeah, we'll have him.

1:20:05.083 --> 1:20:06.583
We'll be rich.

1:20:28.792 --> 1:20:30.708
I thought I'd never see you again.

1:20:30.875 --> 1:20:32.458
I'm here now.

1:20:32.542 --> 1:20:34.875
My mum's put a spell on us.

1:20:34.958 --> 1:20:37.000
I swear she has!

1:20:37.083 --> 1:20:40.375
And my dad
won't even look at me anymore.

1:20:40.458 --> 1:20:41.875
I disgraced him.

1:20:42.792 --> 1:20:44.375
It was my fault, I'm sorry.

1:20:44.792 --> 1:20:45.667
Sorry.

1:20:45.750 --> 1:20:47.042
I'm here.

1:20:47.125 --> 1:20:48.042
I'm here.

1:20:50.375 --> 1:20:51.667
Lie down.

1:21:09.375 --> 1:21:10.958
What did you do today?

1:21:17.292 --> 1:21:18.375
Nothing.

1:21:19.958 --> 1:21:21.458
What's wrong?

1:21:23.792 --> 1:21:24.875
I'm scared.

1:21:30.375 --> 1:21:32.000
I'm scared too.

1:22:23.250 --> 1:22:25.167
All beautiful for me?

1:22:27.667 --> 1:22:28.875
Well, for the show.

1:22:33.083 --> 1:22:34.458
It's all sorted.

1:22:36.167 --> 1:22:38.292
A front-row seat.

1:22:40.583 --> 1:22:42.083
Not way up there.

1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:50.375
Will you come?

1:22:57.792 --> 1:22:59.250
I'll be there.

1:25:01.875 --> 1:25:03.208
I'll take your jacket.

1:25:19.500 --> 1:25:20.458
Where you going?

1:25:30.792 --> 1:25:31.708
Come here.

1:25:31.792 --> 1:25:33.083
You come here.

1:26:22.083 --> 1:26:23.167
Don't you fancy me?

1:26:24.375 --> 1:26:25.542
Yes, I do.

1:26:39.875 --> 1:26:41.375
I'm going for a shower.

1:26:42.292 --> 1:26:43.792
Make yourself comfortable.

1:26:44.292 --> 1:26:45.708
I'll be waiting.

1:27:42.208 --> 1:27:43.583
Can I help you?

1:27:46.292 --> 1:27:47.417
I was looking for cigarettes.

1:27:49.792 --> 1:27:51.125
I don't keep them here.

1:28:03.292 --> 1:28:04.875
You're beautiful.

1:28:21.583 --> 1:28:23.292
What were you looking for?

1:28:26.375 --> 1:28:27.250
As you wish.

1:29:18.292 --> 1:29:20.125
"The Konis Dancers."

1:29:23.375 --> 1:29:24.667
You should have gone.

1:30:57.583 --> 1:30:58.583
No way!

1:30:59.792 --> 1:31:01.042
No way!

1:31:38.458 --> 1:31:40.625
OK? U back at the estate?

1:32:38.958 --> 1:32:40.667
Yeah, Maimouna...

1:32:41.375 --> 1:32:42.583
It's me.

1:32:45.792 --> 1:32:48.042
I wanted to tell you I did it.

1:32:51.292 --> 1:32:52.542
I did it!

1:32:58.167 --> 1:33:01.667
I left your share in the hiding place.

1:33:02.208 --> 1:33:04.792
I just wanted you to know...
I'm leaving.

1:33:07.667 --> 1:33:09.583
But I'll be back soon.

1:33:13.375 --> 1:33:14.792
I miss you.

1:33:17.458 --> 1:33:18.792
I love you.

1:33:54.167 --> 1:33:58.125
<i>-Come back or I'll hurt her bad!</i>
<i>-Don't come, Dounia!</i>

1:33:58.208 --> 1:34:00.583
<i>-Come for your friend!</i>
<i>-Don't come!</i>

1:34:22.792 --> 1:34:24.708
Keep quiet!

1:34:25.042 --> 1:34:27.000
Not a sound. Shut it!

1:34:29.042 --> 1:34:31.875
She's crafty.
You think she'll show up?

1:34:31.958 --> 1:34:34.458
-Shut your mouth!
-She won't come.

1:34:34.542 --> 1:34:36.875
Shut your mouth, I said. Shut it!

1:34:42.750 --> 1:34:44.583
It's me, let me in!

1:34:46.792 --> 1:34:47.708
Where is she?

1:34:51.792 --> 1:34:53.083
Trying to fuck me?

1:34:55.042 --> 1:34:56.000
You okay?

1:34:58.500 --> 1:35:01.875
-Who told you to untie her?
-Keep still!

1:35:02.500 --> 1:35:04.042
She's got her money back!

1:35:07.708 --> 1:35:08.875
It's not all here.

1:35:09.375 --> 1:35:10.583
Where's the rest?

1:35:12.750 --> 1:35:14.458
What did you do with my money?

1:35:16.083 --> 1:35:18.333
I'm talking to you!

1:35:18.917 --> 1:35:21.167
-You whore, just like your mum!
-Shut it!

1:35:21.250 --> 1:35:24.375
Don't tell me to shut it!
You little whore!

1:35:24.458 --> 1:35:26.875
Where is it? Where's my money?

1:35:27.208 --> 1:35:28.667
Where's my money?

1:35:28.750 --> 1:35:29.750
Please tell them.

1:35:29.833 --> 1:35:30.792
Shut it, you!

1:35:31.583 --> 1:35:33.208
What did you do with it?

1:35:37.083 --> 1:35:39.083
-What are you doing?
-No, wait!

1:35:39.833 --> 1:35:41.000
Get outta my way!

1:35:41.083 --> 1:35:42.458
No, don't!

1:35:42.542 --> 1:35:45.750
Tell them, Dounia, please!
You're mad!

1:35:46.958 --> 1:35:48.292
You shut it!

1:35:49.792 --> 1:35:51.750
Is this what you want?

1:35:51.833 --> 1:35:53.708
You wanna go up in flames?

1:35:54.583 --> 1:35:56.167
Where's my money?

1:35:57.167 --> 1:35:58.042
I'm talking to you!

1:35:59.458 --> 1:36:01.417
Dounia, tell her!

1:36:01.500 --> 1:36:03.458
You don't want to die for money!

1:36:03.542 --> 1:36:05.792
Stop playing the gangster!

1:36:05.875 --> 1:36:07.375
I'm gonna burn you!

1:36:07.458 --> 1:36:09.208
Please, Rebecca.

1:36:10.667 --> 1:36:11.750
Go on, do it.

1:36:15.958 --> 1:36:17.083
Are you scared?

1:36:18.042 --> 1:36:19.750
I can see you are.

1:36:21.375 --> 1:36:24.125
-I'll go to her mum's.
-No, you won't!

1:36:25.500 --> 1:36:27.708
It's at her mum's!

1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:28.917
Go, hurry!

1:36:29.500 --> 1:36:30.458
No, don't!

1:36:31.583 --> 1:36:33.625
It's my money! Don't go there!

1:36:33.708 --> 1:36:35.500
-Shut it!
-Don't go!

1:36:35.583 --> 1:36:37.375
It's my money! My money!

1:36:39.250 --> 1:36:41.542
You're gonna die, you bastard!

1:36:41.625 --> 1:36:43.042
My name's Dounia!

1:36:44.458 --> 1:36:46.000
My name's Dounia!

1:36:46.083 --> 1:36:47.458
My name's Dounia!

1:36:48.458 --> 1:36:50.208
Never call me bastard again!

1:36:50.292 --> 1:36:52.708
My name is Dounia!

1:36:53.042 --> 1:36:54.250
Dounia!

1:36:54.875 --> 1:36:55.833
Dounia, watch out!

1:36:59.417 --> 1:37:00.708
Fuck!

1:37:00.792 --> 1:37:02.333
Samir!

1:37:02.417 --> 1:37:04.083
Samir, come back!

1:37:04.167 --> 1:37:06.208
Help! Samir!

1:37:06.292 --> 1:37:07.875
Give me your top!

1:37:07.958 --> 1:37:09.000
Help!

1:37:11.625 --> 1:37:12.708
Here, quick!

1:37:35.375 --> 1:37:37.208
Help! Help!

1:37:39.625 --> 1:37:40.500
Help!

1:37:40.583 --> 1:37:43.208
Please! We're in here!

1:37:44.792 --> 1:37:46.500
It's Gervais! Call for help!

1:37:47.458 --> 1:37:48.875
Call the fire service!

1:37:48.958 --> 1:37:50.375
Call them, quick!

1:37:51.042 --> 1:37:52.208
Hurry!

1:37:52.292 --> 1:37:53.917
Quick, Maimouna!

1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:55.375
Gervais!

1:37:56.542 --> 1:37:59.000
-Give me your hand!
-Go, Maimouna!

1:37:59.792 --> 1:38:00.875
Hurry!

1:38:00.958 --> 1:38:02.708
Quick, Maimouna!

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.375
I can't get through.

1:38:08.875 --> 1:38:10.417
Rebecca, quick!

1:38:11.375 --> 1:38:12.542
Push!

1:38:14.875 --> 1:38:16.250
Dounia, hurry up!

1:38:16.792 --> 1:38:18.000
-Go!
-No.

1:38:18.083 --> 1:38:21.042
You're covered in petrol.
Just go!

1:38:21.125 --> 1:38:22.167
I'm staying here!

1:38:23.417 --> 1:38:25.375
-Get out!
-I'm staying with you.

1:38:25.458 --> 1:38:27.458
-I'm not going.
-Go!

1:38:27.542 --> 1:38:29.083
I don't want to go!

1:38:29.167 --> 1:38:30.708
I'm staying here!

1:38:30.792 --> 1:38:32.417
No, let go of me!

1:38:32.500 --> 1:38:33.500
Let go!

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:37.042
Maimouna...

1:38:37.125 --> 1:38:38.292
Come here.

1:38:39.375 --> 1:38:40.958
Come here.

1:38:41.750 --> 1:38:42.875
Breathe.

1:38:42.958 --> 1:38:44.833
Don't worry, I'm here with you.

1:38:45.500 --> 1:38:47.583
I'm here with you, okay?

1:38:48.875 --> 1:38:50.000
You hear that?

1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:51.583
They're coming!

1:38:52.958 --> 1:38:54.583
They're gonna save you.

1:38:54.667 --> 1:38:56.375
See, I told you!

1:38:58.167 --> 1:39:00.125
Those bastards won't come in.

1:39:00.208 --> 1:39:01.708
What do you mean?

1:39:01.792 --> 1:39:02.958
Go and get them!

1:39:03.042 --> 1:39:05.125
They're afraid of getting attacked.

1:39:05.208 --> 1:39:06.375
Maimouna,

1:39:06.458 --> 1:39:08.083
I'll go and get them, okay?

1:39:08.167 --> 1:39:09.208
I'm scared!

1:39:09.292 --> 1:39:11.958
I'll be right back. Breathe!
Stay with her.

1:39:12.542 --> 1:39:13.750
Look at me.

1:39:14.208 --> 1:39:15.833
Look this way!

1:39:20.208 --> 1:39:22.167
Dad!

1:39:22.875 --> 1:39:24.292
Dad!

1:39:26.208 --> 1:39:27.375
Come here!

1:39:29.208 --> 1:39:31.208
-Please!
-We can't intervene.

1:39:31.292 --> 1:39:33.417
She can't get out, she's all alone.

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:35.750
We have to wait for police back-up.

1:39:35.833 --> 1:39:37.625
It's burning!

1:39:37.708 --> 1:39:39.750
I can't do anything.
They're my orders.

1:39:39.833 --> 1:39:41.917
Orders, to let people die?

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.667
-She can't get out!
-We can't.

1:39:43.750 --> 1:39:45.542
What if it were your child?

1:39:45.625 --> 1:39:48.792
You throw rocks at us.
We're not allowed.

1:39:48.875 --> 1:39:50.667
We won't throw rocks,

1:39:50.750 --> 1:39:52.875
I swear! Please!

1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000
-Do your job!
-Dounia, quick!

1:39:55.083 --> 1:39:57.958
Why aren't you coming?
There's fire everywhere!

1:39:58.458 --> 1:39:59.708
Everywhere!

1:39:59.792 --> 1:40:01.375
She'll die!

1:40:01.458 --> 1:40:03.000
She's going to die!

1:40:30.667 --> 1:40:31.917
No!

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.375
It's not happening!

1:40:35.792 --> 1:40:37.667
No, Maimouna!

1:40:40.458 --> 1:40:42.792
No, I'm begging you, no...

1:40:52.083 --> 1:40:53.292
Forgive me.

1:40:54.792 --> 1:40:56.875
Forgive me, forgive me...

1:41:32.917 --> 1:41:35.167
It's all your fault!

1:42:19.292 --> 1:42:20.292
Dounia.

1:42:22.375 --> 1:42:23.792
Where's Maimouna?

1:42:24.167 --> 1:42:26.667
Where's Maimouna? Tell me!
