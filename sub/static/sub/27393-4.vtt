00:09.968 --> 00:13.930
[Alexa] It had been a week and Gwenny
and Lucas were still Gwencas.

00:14.222 --> 00:18.727
Which was as gross as it sounds.
Luckily, I had the best distraction.

00:18.810 --> 00:19.853
Basketball tryouts.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.396
''After a year on injury reserve,

00:21.479 --> 00:23.732
Alexa Mendoza has been cleared
to return to the court,

00:23.815 --> 00:25.233
and she's taking it by storm!

00:25.316 --> 00:27.610
She cuts left, she spins right,
Mendoza shoots!''

00:27.694 --> 00:29.487
''And Mendoza road checks!''

00:31.281 --> 00:32.699
But Mendoza was fouled!

00:32.824 --> 00:34.909
What? No way. Dad, was that a foul?

00:34.993 --> 00:38.872
Ah, don't look at me. I just want to sit
courtside and enjoy my nachos.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.665
Hot hot hot!

00:41.583 --> 00:44.669
Hey, listen, I'm penciling things
into the family calendar, who's got stuff?

00:45.003 --> 00:47.255
Oh, I'm auditioning guys
for my band this afternoon.

00:47.964 --> 00:51.342
-Oh, Dave, that makes me miss your band.
-Bup bup bup bup.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.386
[audience laughing]

00:53.803 --> 00:56.014
Still not over the... "incident"?

00:56.765 --> 01:00.894
-What are you guys talking about?
-Uh, documentaries, car insurance--

01:01.061 --> 01:02.145
Boring!

01:03.646 --> 01:05.023
Works every time.

01:05.523 --> 01:07.859
Hey, my first shift volunteering
at the hospital's tomorrow.

01:07.942 --> 01:10.236
Wanna come by after tryouts?
They'd be happy to see you.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.530
Sorry, Mom,
but I don't think I'll have time.

01:12.614 --> 01:13.948
I'll be too busy doing this.

01:14.032 --> 01:15.867
''Hoowah! Mendoza steals the ball.''

01:16.493 --> 01:17.869
I had the ball?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.080
-It's a fast break.
-Give that back!

01:20.413 --> 01:22.082
[audience laughing]

01:22.707 --> 01:24.709
[series theme song playing]

01:55.573 --> 01:57.242
Today's my first shift at Wired.

01:58.493 --> 02:01.830
What if a customer asks about
the elevation levels of our Arabica beans

02:01.913 --> 02:05.708
and I can't say it's between four
and six thousand feet above sea level?

02:06.042 --> 02:07.710
I mean I'll look like a fool.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.003
[audience laughing]

02:09.087 --> 02:10.338
You'll be great.

02:10.421 --> 02:12.674
And I really want to be there
to support you.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.593
And score a free Rice Krispie treat.
[chuckles]

02:16.302 --> 02:19.722
I really wanted to be there
for your basketball tryouts.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.933
I know. But this is what it'll look like.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.769
Dribble, dribble. Alley-oop and dunk!

02:24.894 --> 02:28.148
[grunts]
Nice! Check out these latte moves.

02:28.606 --> 02:31.442
Gonna tamp the espresso.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.737
Lock it in! You let it fly...

02:35.864 --> 02:37.073
Uh...

02:41.119 --> 02:43.121
This is never gonna be easy, is it?

02:43.246 --> 02:45.248
[audience laughing]

02:48.418 --> 02:50.545
Why does he always walk up
when we're being weird?

02:50.837 --> 02:53.756
I like it! Cody's the only one
who doesn't know I was sick.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.176
It's nice that there's someone
who thinks that I'm weird,

02:56.259 --> 02:58.219
just because I'm weird. [chuckles]

02:58.553 --> 02:59.888
-Hey, guys!
-Hey.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.599
The student I was tutoring
canceled on me. Wanna hang?

03:02.682 --> 03:03.516
Are you kidding?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.227
I could be. You think it's funny?

03:06.352 --> 03:08.354
[audience laughing]

03:08.479 --> 03:10.690
Dylan. I have basketball tryouts.

03:10.773 --> 03:14.110
Right! Which is why
I canceled the tutoring session,

03:14.235 --> 03:16.154
'cause I'm totally going to come
cheer you on.

03:16.529 --> 03:17.363
Nice save.

03:18.823 --> 03:19.699
Oi!

03:20.325 --> 03:22.327
Hey, I had to bus table nine,

03:23.286 --> 03:27.081
big job, kid threw up everywhere.
It's just... I can't.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.709
[audience laughing]

03:31.502 --> 03:33.421
[sighs] Okay. Post-it reminders,

03:33.630 --> 03:34.547
check.

03:35.006 --> 03:39.344
Checking off the Post-it reminders
"reminder Post-it," check.

03:41.012 --> 03:41.846
Here you go.

03:42.263 --> 03:45.058
Oh, wow! My very first...

03:46.976 --> 03:48.311
used apron.

03:49.646 --> 03:51.397
With the name Ted R. on it.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.358
You don't get a new apron
'til you've earned it.

03:53.775 --> 03:56.486
Then I will be the best Ted R.
you've ever had.

03:56.694 --> 03:59.572
Good! 'Cause the real Ted R.
electrocuted himself.

04:00.657 --> 04:04.160
I'm kidding. Ted R.'s my dad. I fired him
because he was terrible.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.538
Wait, wait! Before you go...

04:08.081 --> 04:11.125
I just have one or two or 17
quick questions.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.794
Just pour coffee.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.879
If anyone says it's cold in here,

04:15.088 --> 04:17.131
tell 'em to put on a sweater, Gerald!

04:17.215 --> 04:19.133
[audience laughing]

04:19.259 --> 04:20.343
Pretty basic stuff.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.762
Yeah, but you're a pro.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.473
It's like you were born to do this.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.394
That's the meanest thing,
anyone has ever said to me.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.896
[audience laughing]

04:36.484 --> 04:37.527
Hey, Alexa!

04:37.610 --> 04:39.654
I'm sups glad you get to tryout this year.

04:39.904 --> 04:40.905
What's your angle?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.741
Just looking out for my biffle sis.

04:44.742 --> 04:45.576
Your what?

04:46.202 --> 04:47.662
Biffle sis.

04:47.996 --> 04:49.914
Boyfriend's little sis.

04:50.748 --> 04:52.959
No hard feelings
on trying to ruin Lucas and me.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.003
Hashtag #Strongerthanever.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.879
[audience laughing]

04:57.338 --> 04:59.215
-We're back!
-[girls giggle]

04:59.674 --> 05:02.135
[blows whistle] Line it up!

05:05.179 --> 05:07.890
All right, ladies...

05:08.641 --> 05:12.395
if you wanna make varsity,
you have got the next two days

05:12.520 --> 05:14.522
to prove you can play with the big dogs.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.899
And if you can't, there's always JV.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.985
Where there's much less pressure
because...

05:19.527 --> 05:21.070
Well, it's JV.

05:22.238 --> 05:24.240
White Fang! I work alone.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.660
All right. [blows whistle]

05:27.744 --> 05:29.787
Let's form two lines. One on each wing.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.622
[shoes squeaking on court]

05:31.748 --> 05:33.958
-Oh, hey, Alexa. I wanted to tell you--
-Please, don't.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.545
I appreciate you checking in,
but just treat me like everybody else.

05:38.087 --> 05:39.339
Yeah. Your shoe's untied.

05:40.548 --> 05:43.885
Hah! Just like that!
Glad we had this talk.

05:47.805 --> 05:51.184
Thanks for your interest in the band,
Steve. But you look a little like me.

05:51.309 --> 05:54.103
Now, do I want someone in the band
who could be my cousin?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.855
[hisses] I think not.

05:56.522 --> 05:59.025
But you could always be
the slightly better looking cousin.

06:00.777 --> 06:01.694
I'll be in touch.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.323
Oh, this is so wrong!

06:05.782 --> 06:08.034
-Don't ask, don't ask.
-What's going on, honey?

06:09.410 --> 06:11.245
Kyle's bedtime got moved to 10,

06:11.329 --> 06:14.040
and my mom said
that's not a reason to move mine.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.875
Let it go, Jack.

06:15.958 --> 06:19.045
The last time I let you stay up past 9:30,
you had a meltdown

06:19.128 --> 06:22.423
about wearing green pajamas,
then tried to crawl up the chimney.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.677
Man, putting together a band is so hard.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.222
People are so many different heights!

06:29.389 --> 06:31.015
[audience laughing]

06:31.265 --> 06:34.018
-Hey, did you tell him we had a grunge--
-Uh bup-bup-bup.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.270
You what?

06:36.521 --> 06:39.023
We had a grunge band in high school.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.025
I said bup-bup.

06:41.859 --> 06:46.447
Ah, and you looked adorable with your
ripped jeans and your long, messy hair.

06:46.948 --> 06:48.491
[chuckles] You looked cute too, Dave.

06:49.617 --> 06:53.704
Oh, it was so fun!
I loved being creative and artsy.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.374
-What if I stay up 'til ten?
-We're on me now.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.752
I want to hear more about this band.

07:00.044 --> 07:02.964
We called ourselves Nobody's Puppets.

07:03.548 --> 07:06.134
We knew the only thing that mattered
was the music.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.303
-Let's hear a song!
-Great idea!

07:09.429 --> 07:10.304
No!

07:10.721 --> 07:14.058
-You're not still embarrassed about the--
-No, I'm not.

07:14.183 --> 07:16.769
[scoffs] I don't even know
what you're talking about.

07:17.186 --> 07:19.063
So let's stop talking about it.

07:19.730 --> 07:24.444
Fine. I get all the creative stimulation
I need from working in HR anyway.

07:24.944 --> 07:29.157
Just yesterday, I had to figure out
if Rhonda White's bunion shaving,

07:29.240 --> 07:32.034
counted as a sick day
or personal day, so...

07:33.870 --> 07:35.329
I'm complete.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.498
[audience laughing]

07:42.253 --> 07:44.672
Oh no! Where's my machiatto Post-it?

07:48.718 --> 07:49.635
I'll be in the back.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.722
Wait, now? But it's the evening rush!

07:54.056 --> 07:54.891
[exhales]

07:57.727 --> 07:58.811
Welcome to Wired.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.229
The usual.

08:01.272 --> 08:05.526
Could you be more specific?
See it's my first day, so...

08:05.985 --> 08:09.655
my usual is not being here.
[chuckles]

08:10.072 --> 08:12.950
Spare me the life story, Ted R.

08:13.743 --> 08:15.912
Coffee black. With a pump of hazelnut.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.371
Lock it in.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.373
Okay.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.001
Coffee.

08:22.793 --> 08:26.214
Black. With a pump of hazelnut.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.800
No tears, no tears, no tears.

08:32.553 --> 08:33.387
[sighs]

08:34.263 --> 08:35.306
Enjoy.

08:37.225 --> 08:40.269
Ahem. Sorry I spilled your last coffee,
but now...

08:40.394 --> 08:41.771
[gasps]

08:43.940 --> 08:46.526
Now, I know not to hold it by the lid.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.320
Done.
[laughs awkwardly]

08:49.904 --> 08:50.947
Third time's a charm.

08:52.573 --> 08:53.533
Sure is.

08:54.659 --> 08:55.618
[sighs]

08:56.577 --> 08:58.746
-Oh.
-Where's my food?

08:59.705 --> 09:02.458
I am so sorry. I...

09:03.709 --> 09:05.836
Wait, you didn't order food.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.880
I'll have my usual.

09:09.090 --> 09:10.132
Of course.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.262
[whimpers] No tears, no tears, no tears.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.891
[Alexa panting]

09:20.351 --> 09:21.394
[whistle blows]

09:23.938 --> 09:27.692
Did the... court get...

09:29.193 --> 09:30.236
longer?

09:37.159 --> 09:39.912
-Hey, you're doing great!
-I was terrible.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.915
Well, just remember:

09:44.292 --> 09:46.127
Basketball is all about the three Hs.

09:46.460 --> 09:48.838
Head, heart and having fun out there.

09:49.922 --> 09:51.424
You just read that off the wall.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.888
Well, it was either that
or Bake Sale this Monday.

09:59.974 --> 10:00.808
Hmm.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.061
Don't stress out too much, okay?
It's just basketball.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.438
Just basketball?

10:06.480 --> 10:07.732
I'm sorry.

10:08.190 --> 10:11.611
Maybe me being here is making you nervous?
I don't want to be a jinx.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.404
No. Stay.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.281
I don't believe in jinxes.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.783
[shoes squeaking on court]

10:35.051 --> 10:37.053
[coach blows whistle]

10:43.309 --> 10:44.352
[grunts]

10:50.524 --> 10:52.068
-You're a jinx! Get out!
-Yeah.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.284
-[sighs] Today was the worst.
-The worst.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.078
[sighs] I was terrible out there.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.121
I was a horrible barista.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.831
[sighs] I couldn't hit a shot!

11:06.082 --> 11:08.000
I couldn't barrist anything.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.713
Look, at least, if I get fired,
I don't have to keep the job a secret

11:12.838 --> 11:13.839
from my mom anymore.

11:14.215 --> 11:16.342
Yeah, that's the spirit. Think positive.

11:17.468 --> 11:20.930
I should have used word associations
to remember the drinks!

11:21.305 --> 11:22.932
God, it was a disaster.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.519
And... a customer yelled at me.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.314
What? Well, next time,
tell 'em to back off.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.358
And be patient with yourself.

11:32.441 --> 11:34.610
You don't have to be perfect.
It takes time.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.321
You know what?

11:38.823 --> 11:40.282
You are right.

11:42.076 --> 11:43.953
I mean, who is perfect on their first day?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.373
[laughs] I'll be perfect tomorrow.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.126
-No, that's not quite what I...
-[slams door]

11:52.336 --> 11:53.170
[grunts]

11:54.588 --> 11:57.550
Ehh... whyyyyyyyy?

11:58.008 --> 12:00.886
Hey, listen, I'm volunteering tomorrow,
but I want to hear how tryouts go.

12:00.970 --> 12:04.306
-So make sure you text me.
-Well, I hope they go better than today.

12:04.807 --> 12:08.060
It's so annoying. Dr. Breitwieser said
I was back to normal again.

12:08.894 --> 12:12.815
Well, he said you were healthy enough
to try out for basketball again.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.736
Do you know how lucky you are,
that he even cleared you to try out?

12:17.027 --> 12:17.945
Lucky?

12:18.112 --> 12:20.614
If I hadn't gotten sick, I would have been
on the team last year,

12:20.740 --> 12:22.491
and now, I'd make varsity easy.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.953
So, no. I'm not feeling lucky right now.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.873
I just want things to be back
to the way they were.

12:29.707 --> 12:32.835
And with more practice,
you're gonna be great again! All right?

12:33.252 --> 12:34.712
You need to be patient with yourself.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.631
You don't have to be perfect.
It takes time.

12:38.299 --> 12:39.133
You're right.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.385
I just need more practice.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.596
I'll be perfect tomorrow.

12:48.851 --> 12:49.810
Yes!

12:50.227 --> 12:52.146
All right, ladies, here it is.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.065
Read it and weep somewhere else.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.817
[audience laughing]

12:56.942 --> 12:58.694
[girl] Yes! Varsity!

12:58.778 --> 13:00.362
[girls chortling]

13:01.322 --> 13:02.573
Oh! Mendoza.

13:03.032 --> 13:05.993
I wanted to tell you myself.
I am going to give you a shot.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.370
-Really?
-Yeah, but you'll be on the bench

13:08.454 --> 13:10.080
until you get more practice with the team.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.750
I don't care.
I'm just so happy to make the team.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.752
Oh, that's a great attitude!

13:15.044 --> 13:18.005
I wish all my girls got this excited
about JV.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.259
JV? But...

13:24.011 --> 13:25.387
[girls chuckle]

13:39.026 --> 13:41.403
I can't decide between these guys
for my band.

13:41.821 --> 13:45.157
Jack, who looks the most like the bad boy?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.578
I need to start penciling more flights
into my schedule.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.122
I've been thinking about it all day.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.167
We're getting the band back together.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.169
I am not taking no for an answer.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.254
No.

13:59.505 --> 14:02.007
-I don't think he'll ever get over it.
-Over what?

14:02.883 --> 14:05.886
Well, there was an incident
at a talent show.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.514
It involved cargo pants that...

14:08.722 --> 14:12.101
may or may not have ripped on an amp.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.478
Just before an enthusiastic stage dive,

14:14.562 --> 14:17.523
which then led to some
very awkward crowd surfing.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.069
And the nickname... Grunge Buns.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.823
Then your dad quit the band.

14:26.156 --> 14:29.869
Oh, I loved it when he played.
We've to think of a way to convince him.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.829
You should do a concert right here!

14:32.121 --> 14:33.080
Great idea!

14:33.372 --> 14:35.499
And it should start at 9:30.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.252
You'll already be in bed.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.671
Too bad you're gonna miss it. Bummer.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.507
-All right, let's do this!
-Yes!

14:43.632 --> 14:45.259
-Yeah!
-[shouts] Who cares!

14:45.509 --> 14:47.511
[audience laughing]

14:48.721 --> 14:51.557
Cappuccino. Huh. Chino.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.811
Choo-choo. Train. Steam.

14:56.020 --> 14:58.188
Foam. Got it! [chuckles]

15:00.691 --> 15:03.694
The usual. Coffee, black.

15:05.195 --> 15:07.656
Pump of hazelnut. Uh-huh.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.535
Everyone knows Fridays are the day
I loosen up and go crazy.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.372
Get me a caramel Americano.

15:15.873 --> 15:20.711
Okay. Okay... Americano.

15:21.879 --> 15:25.925
Avocado, doh, doh bird.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.344
Extinct, no milk.

15:28.802 --> 15:29.678
Pick up the pace.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.973
Ha-ha. Barry, boss, a bitter...

15:34.600 --> 15:36.143
but great!

15:37.645 --> 15:38.687
Uh, here you go.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.190
It's spilling all over the place.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.316
Oh, wow, sorry.

15:43.067 --> 15:45.402
It's just one drop. [chuckles]

15:45.527 --> 15:47.321
So you're proud of mediocrity.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.031
Wow.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.533
You know what, back off!

15:52.159 --> 15:53.243
What did you say?

15:53.661 --> 15:54.995
Back off, I think.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.584
You are the rudest,
most incompetent person I've ever met.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.836
It's only my second day.

16:03.629 --> 16:06.298
Yesterday, I spilled four coffees, so...

16:06.590 --> 16:08.092
one drop isn't so bad.

16:09.259 --> 16:11.053
Look, I'm still learning, like...

16:11.512 --> 16:12.763
like what's in a latte,

16:12.846 --> 16:16.475
and how second degree burns do not
always require hospital visits.

16:18.268 --> 16:20.270
So, yes, I made a mistake.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.356
Let it go, lady.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.025
Hey, that's enough. You're out of here.

16:27.569 --> 16:28.487
Not you.

16:29.154 --> 16:29.989
You.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.533
No one's rude to my employees, but me.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.284
[Katie chuckles]

16:34.660 --> 16:35.619
That's right!

16:35.703 --> 16:38.288
You don't mess with Ted R.! [scoffs]

16:38.372 --> 16:39.498
[audience laughing]

16:40.874 --> 16:41.834
Hey thanks, Barry.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.003
You're abrasive and unprofessional.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.630
You remind me of a young me.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.674
[chuckles]

16:49.008 --> 16:51.343
You know, that's the meanest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

16:53.804 --> 16:54.680
Yes!

16:55.597 --> 16:57.099
Dave, come down here!

16:57.683 --> 16:58.934
Lucas, mic me.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.605

-Is that my guitar?

17:04.231 --> 17:05.899
Fans were calling for an encore.

17:06.108 --> 17:09.069
Of the song. Not the... you know.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.654
[sighs]

17:10.904 --> 17:12.489
Well, I'm not interested.

Ugh! Come on, honey, I've to leave
for the hospital soon. Play something!

Yeah, I am.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.577
Rough day?

19:21.785 --> 19:24.746
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-Let me tell you about my day.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.082
It was horrible! I got pushed around.

Hey, when you're dressed like a giant dog,
you know the risks.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.395
It has been a rough day. [sighs]

19:49.146 --> 19:51.148
[chuckles] Yeah, I was there.

19:51.857 --> 19:52.691
Sorry.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.820
I was good! [huffs]

19:57.821 --> 20:00.157
I just couldn't play last year
because I got...

20:02.826 --> 20:04.828
Well, this thing happened, and...

20:05.329 --> 20:07.164
everything got really weird, and...

20:07.664 --> 20:10.500
I thought things were back to normal,
but they're not.

20:12.085 --> 20:12.920
I'm really...

20:14.379 --> 20:15.589
not following.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.216
[audience laughing]

20:17.341 --> 20:19.218
I wanted to play basketball so bad.

20:19.801 --> 20:22.012
But I'm not riding bench on JV.

20:22.304 --> 20:25.057
You're only a sophomore.
You can play varsity next year.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.059
I'm supposed to be varsity now.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.353
I was told I could play.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.232
[sighs] Why did this have to happen?

20:34.399 --> 20:36.151
Why does anything have to happen?

20:37.527 --> 20:38.946
I mean, no one really knows.

20:40.030 --> 20:40.906
Should I know?

20:42.658 --> 20:43.659
Someone does.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.703
-Hey, where you going?
-To get answers, thanks.

20:50.165 --> 20:52.417
She still makes more sense
than the blond one.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.005
Alexa, how's it going?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.548
I need to talk to Dr. Breitwieser

20:58.632 --> 21:00.592
about when I'm gonna be good
at basketball again.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.637
That is very specific, um...

21:04.137 --> 21:06.056
-Sorry, he's out for a couple of--
-I'll wait.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.557
So, feel free to wait.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.770
Sasha, aren't you supposed to be
in the game room?

21:12.229 --> 21:14.231
That volunteer is super competitive.

21:16.275 --> 21:19.278
Does she have brown hair and told you
to pick any game you want,

21:19.361 --> 21:22.155
over and over again until you pick
the game she wanted?

21:22.864 --> 21:24.574
-Yeah!
-That's my mom.

21:25.534 --> 21:28.537
Careful. She once took a hammer
to the Trouble Bubble.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.832
Are we talking about
how scary your mom is?

21:32.291 --> 21:34.751
Do you think she heard that?
I meant she's lovely!

21:34.835 --> 21:36.169
She's lovely!

21:40.132 --> 21:41.258
Sour gummies, huh?

21:41.383 --> 21:43.218
Is the chemo messing with your taste buds?

21:43.719 --> 21:44.594
Totally.

21:44.845 --> 21:47.806
Only things I can really taste
right now are spicy and sour.

21:48.056 --> 21:49.141
But if you have a brother,

21:49.224 --> 21:51.518
you can challenge him
to a jalapeno eating contest.

21:51.768 --> 21:55.397
You'll get a little flavor,
and he'll cry so hard. [chuckles]

21:55.480 --> 21:56.523
[Sasha laughing]

21:57.190 --> 21:59.109
I am definitely doing that.

21:59.901 --> 22:01.153
How do you know all this?

22:01.236 --> 22:03.155
I had leukemia. I'm in maintenance.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.533
Whoa! You look so normal.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.537
Yeah...

22:11.246 --> 22:13.290
Well, I'm not that normal.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.584
[laughs]

22:16.793 --> 22:18.712
I know cancer changes things.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.630
Some things are still different for me.

22:20.964 --> 22:24.634
Like, today, I thought I'd jump right back
in and make varsity basketball,

22:24.718 --> 22:25.844
but I'm stuck on JV.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.721
You get to play sports?

22:28.388 --> 22:29.514
You're so lucky!

22:30.766 --> 22:31.767
Yeah, well--

22:31.933 --> 22:32.893
Oh, I can't wait!

22:33.352 --> 22:34.770
Just knowing that you can...

22:34.853 --> 22:36.313
Maybe next year I can. And...

22:36.980 --> 22:38.398
Oh, I can't wait!

22:40.025 --> 22:40.859
Yeah.

22:41.610 --> 22:42.861
I am pretty lucky.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.490
Sasha, I thought you were getting water.

22:46.573 --> 22:48.367
Oh, hey, honey, is everything okay?

22:48.617 --> 22:50.118
Yeah, everything's fine.

22:50.952 --> 22:54.164
I just went for a walk to plan
how I'm gonna take Park Place from you.

22:54.414 --> 22:56.375
Heh! No one takes Park Place from me.

22:58.919 --> 23:01.671
When I'm better, I'm taking you,
one on one.

23:01.963 --> 23:02.798
You got it.

23:06.301 --> 23:07.803
How were tryouts?

23:08.470 --> 23:11.181
Well, things are definitely not back
to normal.

23:11.848 --> 23:12.808
But you know what?

23:13.809 --> 23:15.769
-That's okay.
-Yeah.

23:16.311 --> 23:17.646
Can I hang out here for a while?

23:18.688 --> 23:21.191
Yeah, I think the kids would like that.

23:21.608 --> 23:24.444
Plus, Sasha told me
you guys are playing games.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.947
And I know all your weaknesses.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.117
[laughs] I will crush you.

23:30.325 --> 23:32.327
[audience laughing]

23:35.997 --> 23:37.290
I have something to show you.

23:37.374 --> 23:40.794
I already told you,
that bruise does not look like a rabbit.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.881
No, it only took me two weeks
to earn my apron. [chuckles]

23:45.549 --> 23:47.717
Well, I'm not surprised. You're amazing.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.304
I still think foamy milk is hard, and...

23:52.139 --> 23:55.058
I'm not sure how dirty chai isn't
an insult, but...

23:55.725 --> 23:58.019
you know, I'm getting better and better.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.563
[buzzer rings]

23:59.646 --> 24:00.689
[Coach] Mendoza! You're in.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.985
[sighs] Time to be the best JV backup
player that ever came off the bench.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.612
Whoo! Let the legend begin!

24:09.197 --> 24:10.282
That's my kid!

Yeah, go, Alexa!

24:12.659 --> 24:15.704
[Alexa] Playing JV might not have brought
the crowds

24:15.787 --> 24:17.914
or the glory I always dreamed of.

24:18.498 --> 24:19.624
But that's okay.

24:20.041 --> 24:23.378
I finally realized getting to play
basketball, at all,

24:23.462 --> 24:26.006
was proof that some dreams
really do come true.
