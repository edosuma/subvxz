WEBVTT

00:00.023 --> 00:01.906
Previously on "The Magicians"...

00:03.594 --> 00:05.530
They know everything...

00:05.562 --> 00:07.832
who you are, what you have done.

00:07.866 --> 00:09.200
You cannot go back.

00:09.233 --> 00:10.668
What am I supposed to do?

00:10.701 --> 00:12.069
What we all do.

00:12.103 --> 00:13.839
Decide.

00:13.976 --> 00:15.249
_

00:15.351 --> 00:17.608
- Hey, where's Kady?
- Who gives a shit?

00:17.641 --> 00:20.077
I don't think Penny even
cares that she's gone.

00:20.110 --> 00:23.390
Believe me, he does.

00:23.714 --> 00:25.523
We're gonna make another you.

00:25.548 --> 00:28.053
You sleep here, your
mind goes into the golem.

00:33.665 --> 00:35.601
The test was positive.

00:35.626 --> 00:36.760
I want an abortion.

00:36.793 --> 00:38.763
It's a totally mundane procedure.

00:38.796 --> 00:40.019
Is it?

00:40.044 --> 00:43.135
'Cause it might not be a simple,
totally mundane human embryo.

00:43.160 --> 00:45.169
Stop. What are you doing? Stop! Kady!

00:47.134 --> 00:48.969
So sorry about this.

00:49.734 --> 00:51.643
That's my Haxenpaxen!

00:51.675 --> 00:54.328
Just imagine what it's
giving off magically.

00:54.353 --> 00:56.750
We're invisible while we're near him.

00:59.125 --> 01:01.118
- Kady!
- Your magic is no good here.

01:02.620 --> 01:04.796
What's with Stink-master Flash?

01:04.858 --> 01:07.057
- He's coming with us.
- It's my mom's contact.

01:07.090 --> 01:09.059
She could help with the baby situation.

01:09.093 --> 01:11.129
They may be able to help
your friend with her problem,

01:11.161 --> 01:14.074
but listen, I would never,
ever do business with them

01:14.099 --> 01:15.231
if I had a choice.

01:15.256 --> 01:17.902
Your majesties, the
much-venerated Emissaries

01:17.927 --> 01:19.637
of our neighbors to the north.

01:19.670 --> 01:23.232
I present Prince Ess of Loria.

01:25.176 --> 01:28.046
- You fucked with us.
- Mm-hmm. Yes, you did.

01:28.078 --> 01:30.581
- You fucked with our castle.
- Amen, sister.

01:30.614 --> 01:32.807
And now the High King and I

01:32.832 --> 01:36.487
hereby declare war on
the kingdom of Loria.

01:36.512 --> 01:37.784
Yes!

01:37.809 --> 01:40.124
Wait, really?

01:40.158 --> 01:42.561
I cast the niffin summoning,
and you didn't come.

01:42.593 --> 01:45.296
You're wrong. I was right there.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.595
I killed you. My cacodemon...

01:47.620 --> 01:50.393
Your cacodemon wasn't
powerful enough to kill me.

01:50.418 --> 01:51.787
It tried.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.322
But when it saw that it couldn't win,

01:53.355 --> 01:54.790
well, let's just say it

01:54.823 --> 01:57.259
stuffed me in a place most convenient...

01:57.293 --> 02:00.029
that stupid tattoo trap on your back.

02:00.061 --> 02:01.899
We're stuck with each other.

02:01.924 --> 02:03.210
Oh, Quentin.

02:03.235 --> 02:05.368
We're gonna have so much fun.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074

02:14.602 --> 02:17.980
Stop ignoring me! Stop
ignoring me, you pussy!

02:25.080 --> 02:26.955
Pay attention to me,
you miserable sad sack!

02:26.956 --> 02:29.268
- What's wrong with you?
- Stop it!

02:32.100 --> 02:34.471
Are you ready to let me out
of that hairy back of yours?

02:34.504 --> 02:35.780
'Cause I'm never gonna stop.

02:35.805 --> 02:37.508
And sooner or later,
one of these dummies

02:37.542 --> 02:40.295
are gonna call the brain
police, and you got priors.

02:41.416 --> 02:43.319
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

02:43.344 --> 02:45.446
This is not Alice. This is not Alice.

02:45.471 --> 02:47.774
Just keep telling yourself that.

02:47.919 --> 02:49.621
You have got to stop.

02:49.653 --> 02:52.691
Fine. Let me out of
this trap, and I'm gone.

02:52.723 --> 02:55.423
Okay, look, Alice...

02:55.727 --> 02:58.915
Evil Thing Inside of Me
That Used to Be Alice...

02:59.040 --> 03:02.077
I have to say the
words to open the trap.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.269
Of my own volition. Out loud.

03:04.301 --> 03:05.603
And I'm not going to do that

03:05.636 --> 03:07.739
because there is one
policy for you out here,

03:07.771 --> 03:09.441
and it is to box you up for eternity.

03:09.473 --> 03:12.213
I'm kind of boxed up right now, in you.

03:12.238 --> 03:15.377
It's not the same
thing, and you know it.

03:16.014 --> 03:18.752
Block of wood isn't
trying to fix this. I am.

03:18.777 --> 03:22.248
Save me? Is that what
you think you're doing?

03:22.273 --> 03:23.655
You think I want that?

03:23.687 --> 03:25.289
I think if you were
really you right now,

03:25.323 --> 03:26.591
that's all you would want.

03:26.623 --> 03:27.992
Oh, what, and you're the world's

03:28.026 --> 03:29.394
foremost expert on all things me?

03:29.426 --> 03:30.527
Based on what?

03:30.561 --> 03:32.296
Our garbage fire of a relationship

03:32.330 --> 03:34.032
that ended with Eliot's
dick in your mouth?

03:34.064 --> 03:35.466
Look, you came really close

03:35.499 --> 03:36.735
to fixing this once for your brother.

03:36.768 --> 03:38.033
I thought I did.

03:38.058 --> 03:39.471
But I was like you then.

03:39.503 --> 03:41.305
Small yet weirdly arrogant

03:41.347 --> 03:43.417
for somebody who didn't
understand magic at all.

03:43.442 --> 03:46.478
If you would just work with
me instead of jabbing at me,

03:46.510 --> 03:47.912
we could figure out what's missing.

03:47.944 --> 03:49.346
We could make the spell work.

03:49.379 --> 03:50.681
We could do this.

03:50.715 --> 03:51.883
Listen to me.

03:51.915 --> 03:56.257
I promise, the math
will never add up, Q.

03:56.488 --> 03:58.890
You'll never get that girl back.

03:58.955 --> 04:03.027
Everything that's missing
burnt up when I became this.

04:03.061 --> 04:05.796
It's gone forever, Q.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.832
This isn't good for either of us.

04:07.865 --> 04:11.536
No, no, this is making
me saner by the second.

04:11.568 --> 04:12.770
I don't want to hurt you.

04:12.804 --> 04:14.539
I actually don't want to hurt anyone.

04:14.572 --> 04:15.755
Bullshit, you're a niffin.

04:15.780 --> 04:17.190
Q, I'm not bloodthirsty.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.777
I just want to be free.

04:18.809 --> 04:21.879
And I already told you I can't do that.

04:21.922 --> 04:24.125
Fine. Just let me take over your body

04:24.150 --> 04:25.816
for just the tiniest little bit.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.063
I'll be good. I'll be so good.

04:28.179 --> 04:30.133
No, that's crazy.

04:30.158 --> 04:33.109
So I have to be a niffin, yet
I don't even get to be a niffin?

04:33.134 --> 04:34.563
I could travel the universe.

04:34.588 --> 04:35.922
I could see things you
couldn't even imagine,

04:35.947 --> 04:38.997
but instead, I have to be
bored and stuck with you!

04:39.030 --> 04:41.566
I'm sorry that it is torture
to be with the one person

04:41.599 --> 04:42.933
who is trying to help you.

04:42.967 --> 04:46.404
So go back to screaming
until you go insane?

04:46.436 --> 04:48.472
- Is that your choice?
- No.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.224
That's your choice.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.506
Or you could be quiet.

04:58.747 --> 05:01.656
And you can let me try and solve this.

05:16.257 --> 05:18.593
Well, this is the place.

05:19.003 --> 05:21.689
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?

05:21.714 --> 05:24.329
I mean, Goldie said they're legit.

05:25.641 --> 05:27.924
Only one way to find out.

06:06.717 --> 06:08.510
- Problem?
- No problem.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.655
We're just discussing how
to handle your situation.

06:11.688 --> 06:14.291
That's okay. My way is best way.

06:14.625 --> 06:16.628
But you can abort it, right?

06:16.660 --> 06:18.829
This is exorcism.

06:18.863 --> 06:20.799
That thing is not human.

06:20.832 --> 06:22.467
The longer it's inside you,

06:22.500 --> 06:24.169
the more tangled it
gets with your essence

06:24.202 --> 06:25.904
and the harder it is for me to help you,

06:25.936 --> 06:27.579
you understand?

06:28.772 --> 06:29.925
Okay.

06:29.950 --> 06:32.017
Then I exorcise the trickster for you.

06:37.681 --> 06:40.150
After you pay. Thank you.

06:41.867 --> 06:43.504
$1 million?

06:43.529 --> 06:45.222
In gold.

06:45.255 --> 06:47.691
Paper money is for
drug dealers and idiots.

06:47.724 --> 06:49.059
Look, Goldie will tell
you I'm good for it.

06:49.092 --> 06:50.895
Can you just do it now
and we'll pay you later?

06:50.928 --> 06:53.198
Bars. Two big bars.

06:53.231 --> 06:54.822
Maybe 60 pounds.

06:54.847 --> 06:56.155
That's all.

07:00.203 --> 07:02.105
What?

07:02.308 --> 07:03.942
No, I'm just... I'm trying to remember

07:03.974 --> 07:05.676
the last time not having enough money

07:05.710 --> 07:07.378
was one of my biggest problems.

07:07.403 --> 07:10.420
Okay, well, cash won't cut it, so, what,

07:10.607 --> 07:12.049
pawnshops?

07:12.217 --> 07:15.486
A million dollars in
chains and earrings?

07:15.520 --> 07:18.326
I mean, that would
take so many pawnshops.

07:18.562 --> 07:20.756
We might as well rob a bank.

07:22.339 --> 07:24.475
Well, we are Magicians.

07:25.796 --> 07:28.033
Why don't we just rob a bank?

07:35.431 --> 07:39.094
<font color="#007700">Synced and corrected by Aaronnmb</font>
www.addic7ed.com

07:41.712 --> 07:44.437
So there's really no way to just...

07:45.414 --> 07:47.585
take it all back?

07:47.618 --> 07:50.722
Your Majesty, one
cannot simply take back

07:50.747 --> 07:52.812
- a declaration of war.
- Good.

07:52.837 --> 07:54.711
Because I don't.

07:54.991 --> 07:57.594
There are Lorian troops
marching to the border.

07:57.628 --> 07:58.830
They're days away.

07:58.863 --> 08:01.032
We believe they intend
to penetrate Fillory

08:01.065 --> 08:03.001
by way of the Grudge Gap.

08:03.034 --> 08:05.169
And, of course, our
preparation is affected

08:05.202 --> 08:09.140
by the continued...
unsteadiness of the Wellspring.

08:09.172 --> 08:11.306
Okay, well, we've got
literally every engineer

08:11.331 --> 08:14.311
in the kingdom working to
de-shit-inate the Wellspring.

08:14.344 --> 08:17.047
Gonna invent the
guillotine in a hot second

08:17.080 --> 08:18.686
if they don't get their shit together.

08:18.711 --> 08:20.446
Everyone is doing their best, my queen.

08:20.471 --> 08:23.863
We expect to clear said water shortly.

08:23.888 --> 08:25.897
We're excessively optimistic.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.300
Spare no expense.

08:27.325 --> 08:28.960
Which brings me to my point.

08:28.993 --> 08:31.890
Fixing the Wellspring is expensive.

08:32.028 --> 08:33.630
War is expensive.

08:33.663 --> 08:36.999
And at this time, we do not
have the funds necessary...

08:37.024 --> 08:38.491
We're broke?

08:52.148 --> 08:54.045
It's magic residue.

08:54.317 --> 08:57.721
Probably from a ward around
the bank's underground vault.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.599
It's a regular bank.

08:59.990 --> 09:02.593
Regular banks have magical wards?

09:02.627 --> 09:05.427
Ones connected to the
Federal Reserve do, yeah.

09:05.452 --> 09:08.286
Okay, so how do we get past it?

09:10.796 --> 09:13.432
- Shit, it's...
- The Haxenpaxen.

09:19.377 --> 09:21.346
Hey, we can't just let it out.

09:21.378 --> 09:23.080
If...

09:56.719 --> 09:58.115
What the fuck?

10:02.419 --> 10:05.656
Oh, my God. What the hell? A spoon?

10:06.824 --> 10:08.192
I think it's dead.

10:08.224 --> 10:10.889
What the hell was it
besides huge and invisible?

10:11.762 --> 10:14.265
Fuck. We have to stop the bleeding.

10:25.636 --> 10:27.356
We should bury it properly.

10:27.381 --> 10:30.013
Okay, but, Jules, we got to move, okay?

10:30.046 --> 10:32.417
We really need to get somewhere safe.

10:32.450 --> 10:34.334
Okay, like?

10:35.452 --> 10:37.740
You're not gonna like it.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.488
Have you seen. the "Twilight" movies?

10:55.522 --> 10:57.626
Specifically the last one?

10:58.090 --> 10:59.158
No.

10:59.191 --> 11:02.040
Huh. That's probably for the best.

11:03.028 --> 11:06.565
Your problems extend beyond your uterus.

11:06.599 --> 11:10.031
The fetus' élan vital is...

11:10.056 --> 11:13.171
entangled with your soul.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.708
I mean, I have read about this,

11:14.740 --> 11:16.976
but I've... I've never
seen it in person.

11:17.009 --> 11:18.711
You will need to find a Mudang.

11:18.744 --> 11:20.513
It's their area.

11:20.546 --> 11:23.582
Yeah, we did. She was expensive.

11:23.615 --> 11:25.151
Yeah, tell me about it.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.868
I've been trying to get
one on staff for years.

11:38.918 --> 11:41.158
That poor girl is fucked.

11:42.029 --> 11:43.967
And you are suggesting?

11:44.926 --> 11:46.406
Let her stay.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.008
I know that you expelled Kady

11:48.041 --> 11:50.444
and that you are not generally
keen on granting asylum,

11:50.477 --> 11:52.012
especially to hedges.

11:52.052 --> 11:56.557
Yes, well, this is a special case.

11:56.583 --> 11:59.137
Julia and I have a past.

11:59.485 --> 12:03.022
Handle it however you
want, but for the record,

12:03.056 --> 12:05.359
that girl will be safer at Brakebills.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.040
Mm.

12:14.399 --> 12:17.532
"How to transfer the
energy from one being

12:17.557 --> 12:20.895
"and transform it."

12:37.214 --> 12:40.085
Hey, what... what are
you two doing here?

12:43.128 --> 12:44.414
What?

12:53.028 --> 12:55.505
What's this bitch doing in my room?

12:55.740 --> 12:57.232
I know.

12:57.257 --> 12:59.232
This was her room, right?

13:01.314 --> 13:02.907
I guess they haven't
moved her stuff yet,

13:02.932 --> 13:05.869
but Fogg said space was limited, so...

13:07.751 --> 13:09.218
I talked to Kady.

13:09.243 --> 13:11.180
What, no respect for the dead, Q?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.857
You're just gonna let her sit on my bed?

13:14.661 --> 13:16.951
Jules, I don't know what to say.

13:16.976 --> 13:18.630
Say what you're thinking.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.400
That I'm cursed.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.494
Must've been a serial
killer in a past life.

13:22.535 --> 13:24.304
Yeah, raise your hand
if she's the reason

13:24.336 --> 13:26.539
that you fucking exploded in this life.

13:26.573 --> 13:28.443
I'm sorry for everything
that's happened.

13:28.468 --> 13:29.576
Yeah, speak for yourself.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.889
For everything that
you're going through.

13:30.914 --> 13:32.701
Mm, now you're just lying to her, Q.

13:32.726 --> 13:34.786
I'm sorry. I'm just having a hard time.

13:34.811 --> 13:38.482
- Yeah, because you blame her.
- I'm not blaming you for Alice.

13:39.719 --> 13:41.123
If I'm being honest.

13:41.148 --> 13:43.225
No, if I make you feel
so shitty, just go.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.770
- No.
- Why?

13:44.795 --> 13:46.647
I'm the reason. If
I'm the reason, then...

13:46.672 --> 13:48.261
'Cause that doesn't feel right either.

13:48.293 --> 13:50.463
I don't know what's right.

13:51.797 --> 13:54.939
My best friend in the
world does crazy shit

13:54.964 --> 13:56.670
and doesn't trust me
and doesn't listen to me.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.438
It is not that simple, and you know it.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.373
I don't... What am I supposed to do?

14:01.407 --> 14:04.310
You guys are both so goddamn maudlin.

14:16.723 --> 14:19.872
I promised you, in Fillory,

14:20.593 --> 14:23.597
when you told me about Reynard,
that I would help you somehow,

14:23.629 --> 14:26.044
and that is not a promise

14:26.069 --> 14:29.126
that I intend on breaking.

14:34.250 --> 14:36.519
So if there's anything that I can do...

14:36.544 --> 14:38.279
Actually, there is.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.900
Help us rob a bank.

14:42.184 --> 14:43.979
Oh, my God, yes.

14:46.058 --> 14:47.861
You say yes.

14:50.355 --> 14:51.825
It's for Professor Mayakovsky!

14:51.858 --> 14:54.861
It was destroyed by other books.

14:54.893 --> 14:56.595
"Future Movements of Magic"

14:56.628 --> 14:58.197
was written by a Polish scientist

14:58.230 --> 14:59.765
who happened to be a...

14:59.799 --> 15:01.103
What?

15:01.128 --> 15:02.602
Jew.

15:02.634 --> 15:05.171
So the eugenics books came for it.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.473
I'm really sorry.

15:06.506 --> 15:08.183
They've been put in
the restricted section

15:08.208 --> 15:10.183
with the other anti-Semitic texts.

15:19.547 --> 15:20.985
Hey.

15:23.928 --> 15:25.586
I'm...

15:27.727 --> 15:29.558
Long story.

15:32.193 --> 15:34.027
Anyway...

16:25.671 --> 16:27.840
There's our little king.

16:29.405 --> 16:32.626
So how have you been since, um...

16:32.651 --> 16:35.154
Uh, I'm managing.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.564
Um, how are things with you guys?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.625
Glad you asked. We're at war.

16:40.650 --> 16:44.804
Also, Fillory is seriously,
dangerously stone-cold broke.

16:44.836 --> 16:46.605
Wait, how is that even possible?

16:46.638 --> 16:48.440
The Nugget Beetles of the Outer Islands,

16:48.474 --> 16:49.975
they literally shit precious stones.

16:50.008 --> 16:51.744
Going extinct, apparently.

16:51.777 --> 16:54.480
Ember shitting in the
power grid really screwed us

16:54.513 --> 16:56.015
in a cornucopia of ways.

16:56.049 --> 16:59.319
And before you ask, yes,
every alchemist in history

16:59.352 --> 17:02.236
is a lying, cheating illusionist.

17:02.261 --> 17:04.323
They turn lead into gold.
It turns right back in a day.

17:04.357 --> 17:06.760
So we are boned.

17:08.492 --> 17:11.365
How would you guys feel
about robbing a bank?

17:15.032 --> 17:16.654
Whew.

17:18.541 --> 17:20.060
So...

17:21.406 --> 17:23.303
what are you really up to?

17:29.442 --> 17:30.944
We need to rob a bank.

17:33.127 --> 17:36.064
A bank heist. Wow.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.558
Hmm, I think the time
we've invested in him

17:38.590 --> 17:39.892
may actually pay off.

17:39.926 --> 17:41.027
Mm-hmm.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.971
Okay, first, there's
something I have to tell you.

17:43.996 --> 17:46.632
You're not gonna like
it, but hear me out.

17:46.666 --> 17:49.636
For Julia? The psychopath?

17:49.706 --> 17:52.225
The victim of a fucking rape

17:52.250 --> 17:54.836
by a trickster god.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.802
Look, I got to do this, okay? I owe her.

18:03.906 --> 18:05.041
So?

18:05.066 --> 18:08.925
You gonna ask the traveler you
just fucked the shit out of to help?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.425
I mean, no, I didn't really
feel like I had the right.

18:12.457 --> 18:14.058
That's noble.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.621
But ask.

18:17.629 --> 18:20.973
Not gonna lie, I always
wanted to rob a bank.

18:30.112 --> 18:33.282
To our little thievery corporation.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.154
PS, we still hate you.

18:38.209 --> 18:39.618
But it's the 21st century.

18:39.651 --> 18:40.986
Shouldn't be this hard for a girl

18:41.020 --> 18:42.821
to get an evil demigod abortion.

18:42.855 --> 18:44.310
And we're emotionally advanced.

18:44.335 --> 18:47.232
We can hold resentment and sympathy
for a person at the same time.

18:47.257 --> 18:49.079
And Fillory's broke. We need gold.

18:49.104 --> 18:51.964
So lucky you.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.324
Thank you.

18:53.349 --> 18:55.403
Okay, uh...

18:56.135 --> 18:58.438
so if this heist is happening,

18:58.471 --> 19:00.673
any ideas as to how?

19:01.289 --> 19:02.725
Well, we cased the bank.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.383
There was a pretty gnarly
ward around the vault.

19:05.408 --> 19:07.844
Who here's actually robbed a bank?

19:09.514 --> 19:11.063
When was this?

19:11.088 --> 19:12.803
Senior year of high school.

19:14.119 --> 19:15.921
I had some issues.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.358
Okay, listen up,

19:18.383 --> 19:21.193
'cause I'm only gonna go
through this shit once.

19:21.218 --> 19:22.861
Any bank worth robbing

19:22.895 --> 19:25.770
uses one of a handful
of security systems.

19:25.795 --> 19:27.734
All the usual bells and whistles.

19:27.766 --> 19:29.856
But what most idiots don't know

19:29.881 --> 19:32.871
is, those companies are
all owned by Magicians.

19:32.905 --> 19:34.874
Wait, so the people that work there...

19:34.907 --> 19:38.049
Clueless. Tellers,
managers, security guards.

19:38.074 --> 19:39.221
They're all Muggles.

19:39.246 --> 19:42.214
They have no idea the
vault has a secret feature.

19:42.247 --> 19:43.649
Serious wards.

19:43.683 --> 19:47.036
Designed specifically
to keep out Magicians.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.418
Now, in the case of our target,

19:49.443 --> 19:52.419
their fingerprints
control the alarm systems.

19:53.513 --> 19:54.894
It takes two managers

19:54.926 --> 19:57.482
scanning their prints simultaneously

19:57.507 --> 19:58.598
to do this.

19:58.630 --> 20:01.134
Once both the alarms
and the wards go down,

20:01.166 --> 20:03.770
you've got ten minutes
to get downstairs,

20:03.802 --> 20:05.308
past the armed guards,

20:05.333 --> 20:08.181
and enter in the
correct ten-digit combo.

20:08.206 --> 20:10.043
If you screw up the combination

20:10.076 --> 20:12.078
or you take longer than ten minutes,

20:12.110 --> 20:13.261
you're fucked.

20:13.286 --> 20:16.649
Now, basic bitches trip all
the standard alarm systems,

20:16.682 --> 20:18.051
but Magicians?

20:18.083 --> 20:22.254
We also trip the magic
wards, which means...

20:22.279 --> 20:23.907
battle Magicians.

20:23.932 --> 20:27.735
Full-time security employees
on the DL, with benefits.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.762
You see one, run.

20:29.794 --> 20:32.599
They only ask questions post-mortem.

20:32.631 --> 20:34.666
But our ace is you.

20:34.699 --> 20:37.736
Once we nab prints and drop the wards,

20:37.770 --> 20:39.105
you travel straight in.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.507
You really don't think a
bank vault, of all places,

20:41.541 --> 20:43.176
has anti-traveler protection?

20:43.208 --> 20:44.543
Oh, they do.

20:44.577 --> 20:45.857
The entire floor of the vault

20:45.882 --> 20:47.947
is one big anti-traveling sigil.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.817
You get locked in till
you run out of air.

20:50.849 --> 20:53.953
Yeah. Pass. I like air.

20:53.985 --> 20:55.722
Relax, dummy.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.131
You only get stuck if you hit the floor.

20:58.156 --> 21:00.092
Oh, so it's like "Mission: Impossible."

21:00.126 --> 21:02.829
That movie was stupidly unrealistic.

21:02.861 --> 21:05.230
It's so much easier to just levitate.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.096
Yeah, I don't know how,

21:07.121 --> 21:08.854
and in case you guys have all forgotten,

21:08.879 --> 21:10.168
I can't do magic.

21:10.202 --> 21:12.839
Oh, that's fine. This
is gonna get done to you.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.510
It's a little thingy

21:14.535 --> 21:16.242
any Physical Kid can
make in their sleep.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.043
Gravity belt. Exactly.

21:18.077 --> 21:21.314
Once we drop the wards, float Penny,

21:21.347 --> 21:25.594
he zips in, he zips out... payday.

21:27.057 --> 21:28.621
Julia, run!

21:28.711 --> 21:30.447
It's there. You just don't see it. Go!

21:30.472 --> 21:32.291
- I thought it was dead.
- I guess it's got friends.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.126
- Kady, come on.
- No, you go. I'll catch up.

21:34.159 --> 21:35.687
- Kady!
- No! I need to kill it.

21:35.712 --> 21:36.906
- I'll be fine.
- Why?

21:36.937 --> 21:39.164
- I need its spoon.
- Spoon?

21:52.335 --> 21:53.913
This is yours, isn't it?

21:53.945 --> 21:56.332
You sent those things
after Julia, didn't you?

22:00.619 --> 22:02.523
See, this is what happen
when you don't pay.

22:02.548 --> 22:03.687
Jehn-jang.

22:03.712 --> 22:06.259
- Lady, use your words.
- Dak-chuh!

22:06.291 --> 22:08.047
This is for dokkaebi.

22:08.194 --> 22:10.163
How you say... goblin.

22:10.195 --> 22:11.363
Invisible, right?

22:11.397 --> 22:12.961
- Yeah.
- Right.

22:12.986 --> 22:14.521
This is very old magic.

22:14.546 --> 22:16.882
You bring to life using
old, abandoned things,

22:16.907 --> 22:18.909
like this wooden spoon...

22:19.105 --> 22:20.562
and menstrual blood.

22:20.629 --> 22:22.359
Probably Moon's.

22:24.140 --> 22:25.711
These creatures are mercenaries.

22:25.744 --> 22:27.012
They won't stop.

22:27.045 --> 22:30.382
You kill one, another
one grows in its place.

22:30.416 --> 22:31.783
Very fucked up.

22:31.817 --> 22:33.353
Why the hell would she do that?

22:33.386 --> 22:34.753
To kill your friend.

22:34.787 --> 22:36.389
I told Moon to relax,

22:36.422 --> 22:37.890
but she's all, "Baby's too evil.

22:37.923 --> 22:39.913
"It might hurt more people."

22:39.938 --> 22:41.239
She wants to play it safe

22:41.264 --> 22:43.266
and kill both spawn and mom together.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.863
She's so stupid.

22:44.897 --> 22:47.099
You won't pay if your friend is dead.

22:47.132 --> 22:49.746
Listen, we are trying to
get you the money, okay?

22:49.771 --> 22:51.812
If you want to get paid so fucking bad,

22:51.837 --> 22:53.272
tell her to call it off.

22:53.304 --> 22:56.104
Can't. She has a hundred spoons.

22:56.129 --> 22:59.044
Dokkaebi will not stop
until trickster baby is dead,

22:59.078 --> 23:00.847
so you got two options.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.881
I can exorcise for you,

23:02.915 --> 23:05.602
or monster rips your
friend's head off her neck.

23:05.627 --> 23:07.655
So hurry up with my gold.

23:20.366 --> 23:21.938
Hey.

23:23.037 --> 23:24.439
What's that?

23:24.464 --> 23:25.698
You remember that one time

23:25.723 --> 23:27.715
Richard and the Free
Traders rewound time?

23:27.740 --> 23:29.742
- DéjÃ  pizza?
- Yeah.

23:29.774 --> 23:31.824
I think this is how they did it.

23:33.145 --> 23:35.248
That was heavy cooperative magic.

23:35.273 --> 23:38.176
Yeah, well, there are
notes for version 2.0 here.

23:38.216 --> 23:40.820
I mean, it's more
efficient. Takes less juice.

23:40.852 --> 23:42.754
Either one of us could run it.

23:42.788 --> 23:44.452
Let's see.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.730
"The Quarterback"?

23:50.762 --> 23:52.432
Goes back 15 seconds.

23:52.464 --> 23:55.074
Get it? Quarter of a minute?

23:55.801 --> 23:58.457
Yeah, Richard did like his dad jokes.

23:59.687 --> 24:02.049
Anyway, I thought it could be useful,

24:02.074 --> 24:03.810
but at this rate,

24:03.842 --> 24:05.911
I won't actually get
it to work for weeks.

24:05.945 --> 24:07.946
And I guess I'd be weighed
down lugging it anyway.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.916
It's got a pretty small
radius of influence.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.540
Julia, you can't come.

24:14.220 --> 24:15.704
What?

24:16.088 --> 24:17.857
Those invisible blood-goblin things,

24:17.889 --> 24:19.382
they won't stop coming.

24:19.407 --> 24:22.195
I mean, not until your problem's dead,

24:22.649 --> 24:25.618
meaning you are.

24:25.643 --> 24:27.800
If you step out from
under these wards...

24:27.832 --> 24:29.974
It'll find me and all of you.

24:31.209 --> 24:33.806
So I'm supposed to, what, just
wait here, fingers crossed,

24:33.839 --> 24:35.808
while everyone who blames
me for Alice's death

24:35.840 --> 24:36.943
risks their life?

24:36.975 --> 24:38.607
I mean, how does that even make sense?

24:38.632 --> 24:41.503
Just 'cause you can't come
doesn't mean you can't be there.

24:43.381 --> 24:46.218
You can listen in and watch.

24:50.334 --> 24:51.791
All right, but if anything goes wrong...

24:51.823 --> 24:54.037
Nothing will. Okay?

25:05.505 --> 25:08.794
Librarian, Neck Beard,
and White Privilege.

25:08.974 --> 25:12.177
They're the managers. We
need two of their prints.

25:12.211 --> 25:16.489
The good news is, they all go
to the same lame bar after work.

25:17.116 --> 25:20.599
I'll take White Privilege.
Kady, you take Neck Beard.

25:21.005 --> 25:24.122
Oh, nut up. It's just a finger.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.926
Walk up to him, grab his hand,
and say, "Can I borrow this?"

25:27.960 --> 25:29.801
Dip his stupid finger in his drink

25:29.826 --> 25:31.935
to sanitize it, and...

25:33.032 --> 25:36.101
pop it in your mouth, walk away,

25:36.135 --> 25:39.052
yet stay emblazoned on
his heart for a lifetime.

25:39.077 --> 25:41.036
Done and done.

25:41.942 --> 25:42.949
Fine.

25:42.974 --> 25:44.169
Why does it got to be Kady?

25:44.194 --> 25:45.978
It could be Penny or Eliot.

25:46.011 --> 25:47.692
- Or you.
- Yeah.

25:48.028 --> 25:49.881
Sounded like volunteering.

25:49.915 --> 25:52.308
- Okay, fine, I'll take the librarian.
- Ha-ha.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.420
Great. Quentin will go in my place.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.081
Thanks, Q.

26:06.704 --> 26:10.981
So he really just stuck
that in your mouth?

26:11.006 --> 26:12.219
Yup.

26:13.159 --> 26:15.349
That is how the spell works.

26:15.374 --> 26:17.086
Damn.

26:19.978 --> 26:23.515
Unexpectedly, I'm somehow
turned on right now.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.412
Oh, really?

26:25.951 --> 26:28.030
- Look at this idiot.
- Ugh.

26:28.954 --> 26:30.546
Took you long enough.

26:31.815 --> 26:33.818
So show us the goods.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.196
Oh, God.

26:38.230 --> 26:40.066
Oh, that's bad.

26:40.099 --> 26:42.301
How'd you get it in your mouth?

26:43.935 --> 26:46.426
Oh, it wasn't with your mouth, was it?

26:46.489 --> 26:47.724
- Wh...
- Oh!

26:47.749 --> 26:50.168
- Oh, shit!
- Mm-mm.

26:50.541 --> 26:52.778
She went Digital Underground?

26:52.803 --> 26:54.973
- Oh, God.
- Whoo!

26:55.179 --> 26:56.800
What else do we have to do?

26:56.825 --> 26:58.416
With these, we're golden.

26:58.449 --> 27:01.654
Margo and Eliot grabbed everything
else we need for the morning.

27:01.686 --> 27:04.022
So go rest up, Goldwater.

27:04.085 --> 27:05.817
You've earned it.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.002
All right.

27:16.034 --> 27:18.403
Stick to the plan precisely,

27:18.436 --> 27:20.205
and we should be golden.

27:20.239 --> 27:21.507
I'll be right here waiting,

27:21.540 --> 27:22.642
engines running.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.143
Of course you will.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.543
The brains of the operation

27:25.577 --> 27:27.044
drives the getaway.

27:27.069 --> 27:29.536
- Everyone knows that.
- Of course.

27:30.282 --> 27:33.684
Okay, bitches. Let's do this.

27:45.746 --> 27:48.205
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

28:07.549 --> 28:08.860
Ah!

28:27.077 --> 28:28.360
Good luck.

29:11.405 --> 29:14.041
All right. Let's set the clocks.

29:20.222 --> 29:21.434
Okay.

29:22.985 --> 29:24.988
Three, two, one.

29:28.322 --> 29:31.126
Okay. Alarms and wards are down.

29:31.158 --> 29:33.628
It's up to Penny now.

29:34.896 --> 29:36.264
Let's go.

29:45.040 --> 29:48.577
Wait. Oh, shit. Um...

29:54.439 --> 29:55.816
Ha-ha.

30:02.715 --> 30:04.062
Oh, shit.

30:21.165 --> 30:22.374
Shit!

31:00.115 --> 31:02.119
God damn it.

31:02.850 --> 31:04.541
Fuck.

31:05.003 --> 31:06.872
Fucking Physical Kids.

31:09.147 --> 31:11.733
Penny's only got one
minute. Where the hell is he?

31:12.726 --> 31:14.881
Cutting it a little
close, don't you think?

31:14.944 --> 31:16.263
So where's the booty?

31:16.297 --> 31:17.699
Eliot, who are you talking to?

31:17.732 --> 31:19.608
They can't see me. I'm
not technically here.

31:19.633 --> 31:21.002
I'm incepting your ass!

31:21.036 --> 31:23.071
Your head. Your dreams.

31:23.104 --> 31:25.173
You're still asleep
in Fillory, remember?

31:25.205 --> 31:26.974
That is overly complicated.

31:27.008 --> 31:29.473
You know what's not?
The sigil I just touched

31:29.498 --> 31:31.646
'cause someone messed
up the buoyancy math.

31:31.678 --> 31:33.281
Oh, that is not good.

31:33.313 --> 31:34.864
Eliot, what's going on?

31:34.889 --> 31:37.019
How do I put this? Penny fucked up.

31:37.051 --> 31:39.286
No, it's your stupid
device. I'm stuck now.

31:39.319 --> 31:41.155
Penny's incepting my... never mind.

31:41.188 --> 31:43.391
Just trust me, we have to
get him out of that vault now.

31:44.549 --> 31:47.269
Or, say, sometime in
the previous ten minutes.

31:47.294 --> 31:50.131
Fuck. Shit.

31:50.165 --> 31:51.867
Shit, let's go!

31:51.899 --> 31:54.069
Tell her I'm fine. I'm
just... I'm running out of air.

31:54.101 --> 31:55.538
Well, way to mix the message.

31:59.473 --> 32:01.275
Hey, Margo, keep the engine running.

32:01.309 --> 32:02.411
I'll inform the bank manager

32:02.444 --> 32:04.491
the bees are resisting extermination

32:04.516 --> 32:06.380
and everyone needs to
stay clear a little longer.

32:06.414 --> 32:08.849
Let's go, kids. We're going back in.

32:23.197 --> 32:25.183
- Shh. Quiet.
- Stop it.

32:25.965 --> 32:27.533
You...

32:28.120 --> 32:30.683
- you are bad.
- No, you're bad.

32:36.316 --> 32:37.945
- Oh, shit.
- What?

32:37.979 --> 32:40.269
- Guards.
- What? I thought they evacuated.

32:40.294 --> 32:42.730
I got this. I brought
the perfect weapon.

32:42.755 --> 32:43.990
Wait, you're not gonna...

32:44.015 --> 32:45.928
Kill them? God, no.

32:45.953 --> 32:49.027
The Wrecking Ball is a weapon of peace.

32:49.257 --> 32:51.927
Trust me. I'm a genius.

32:53.494 --> 32:55.229
Read the book, and then
you watch the movie,

32:55.262 --> 32:56.464
and it's always just whiny.

32:58.366 --> 33:00.327
I'm totally disappointed in the book.

33:00.352 --> 33:01.677
Mind if I read you?

33:01.702 --> 33:03.101
Stop it.

33:03.126 --> 33:04.227
Stop it!

Whipped that up trying
to get anybody to dance

33:44.913 --> 33:47.883
at our cottage soirees,
but it came on a bit strong.

33:47.915 --> 33:49.217
Shit.

33:55.981 --> 33:57.689
There's no way we can pick this lock.

33:57.714 --> 33:59.261
Maybe we can brute-force it.

33:59.293 --> 34:03.264
Hold on. I think this door
is too thick, even for you.

34:03.298 --> 34:04.623
Okay, just so we're
all on the same page,

34:04.648 --> 34:06.248
we've got less than four minutes.

34:07.335 --> 34:10.099
Penny! We're getting you out!

34:10.219 --> 34:12.755
I don't even think Alice could
do this in under four minutes.

34:12.780 --> 34:15.083
Maybe not then, but
now I could do it in 15.

34:15.108 --> 34:16.411
Seconds.

34:16.444 --> 34:18.466
Oh, well. Rest in peace, Penny.

34:20.047 --> 34:21.896
Well, I guess I could help.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.427
For a price.

34:24.411 --> 34:25.851
I want to drive.

34:25.876 --> 34:28.063
For an hour a day, I
get control of your body.

34:28.088 --> 34:31.092
Okay, okay. Maybe we break
this up. We split up the work.

34:31.125 --> 34:32.460
I don't even know where to start.

34:32.492 --> 34:34.029
Well, we can't just stand here!

34:34.061 --> 34:35.197
I wouldn't hurt anyone.

34:35.230 --> 34:37.965
I just want to stretch the tiniest bit.

34:37.998 --> 34:39.203
Breathe.

34:39.391 --> 34:41.500
You set the terms. We could
even do a "word as bond"

34:41.525 --> 34:43.203
so that I can't break it.

34:45.199 --> 34:47.768
Okay. 30 minutes. That's all you get.

34:47.793 --> 34:50.469
After we hash out the "word as bond."

34:50.993 --> 34:52.179
Great.

34:52.212 --> 34:53.547
You try anything crazy...

34:53.581 --> 34:55.250
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Box.

34:55.282 --> 34:56.518
Is it a deal?

34:56.550 --> 34:57.918
Fine, it's a deal.

34:57.951 --> 34:59.486
Are you talking to yourself?

35:00.176 --> 35:02.792
No. Yes. Uh...

35:04.042 --> 35:06.893
Yes. I'm just... I'm doing
long division in my head.

35:06.918 --> 35:08.839
Move. Move.

35:39.661 --> 35:42.030
I've always been good at math.

35:43.331 --> 35:46.001
- Hi. You okay?
- Oh, shit. Yeah, I'm okay.

35:46.034 --> 35:47.168
- Okay.
- All right.

35:47.201 --> 35:48.683
Princess rescued.

35:48.708 --> 35:51.110
Let's collect our reward and go.

35:57.545 --> 35:59.313
Yes!

36:02.150 --> 36:04.019
Oh, shit.

36:05.258 --> 36:07.227
Q, stop! Oh!

36:07.252 --> 36:08.489
Shit! Oh, no.

36:43.257 --> 36:44.927
- Let's go!
- Come on.

36:45.809 --> 36:47.078
Okay.

36:47.362 --> 36:48.997
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:49.029 --> 36:51.065
Go back! Go back! Go back!

36:58.558 --> 37:00.638
Shit.

37:02.342 --> 37:05.246
Oh, shit, shit, shit!

37:10.505 --> 37:12.057
Well, why should I go out there first?

37:12.082 --> 37:13.698
You're the battle Magician.

37:13.723 --> 37:15.432
What about another Wrecking Ball?

37:15.457 --> 37:17.224
It was a one-off.

37:21.367 --> 37:23.102
Oh, shit.

37:25.953 --> 37:28.690
You're the... the battle Magician.

37:28.715 --> 37:31.108
- Wait, did we just...
- Go back in time?

37:31.133 --> 37:33.140
Yeah. Julia?

37:33.174 --> 37:35.264
I'm outside. I can see
you in the van's mirror.

37:35.289 --> 37:37.428
The effect reaches far enough?

37:37.931 --> 37:39.756
Listen, you only have four rewinds.

37:39.781 --> 37:40.920
Julia's outside.

37:40.945 --> 37:43.347
She's watching with a
machine that can rewind time.

37:53.063 --> 37:54.565
Let's go!

37:58.940 --> 38:00.008
You're the...

38:00.033 --> 38:01.903
Kady, three rewinds left.

38:01.928 --> 38:03.526
She can only go back 15 seconds.

38:03.551 --> 38:04.698
Let's go!

38:12.328 --> 38:14.824
- You're the...
- Two rewinds left.

38:23.403 --> 38:24.675
Penny!

38:25.355 --> 38:26.828
Kady, last rewind.

38:26.860 --> 38:28.292
Okay, look. We need a plan.

38:28.317 --> 38:30.705
Okay. Okay, I'll blast the bitch.

38:30.730 --> 38:32.261
You all run left. She's
always on the right.

38:32.286 --> 38:34.413
Is she? 'Cause the last time, I
thought she was more in the middle.

38:34.438 --> 38:36.240
15 seconds!

38:47.139 --> 38:48.274
Let's go.

38:55.279 --> 38:56.759
Kady!

38:59.947 --> 39:01.321
Julia.

39:02.163 --> 39:03.732
Julia, answer me.

39:04.773 --> 39:06.908
Shit. Let's go.

39:07.675 --> 39:09.142
Q, come on. Grab the bar.

39:09.167 --> 39:11.728
- But...
- Grab the bar! Let's go!

39:11.753 --> 39:13.203
- What about...
- It's clay.

39:13.228 --> 39:14.932
Eliot's fine. Let's go!

39:16.629 --> 39:17.979
Eliot?

39:18.113 --> 39:20.705
Eliot! Eliot!

39:21.307 --> 39:22.650
Guards!

39:40.159 --> 39:41.828
Julia. Are you okay?

39:41.853 --> 39:43.922
Jules. Julia?

39:43.994 --> 39:45.961
- Talk to me.
- Julia, stay with us.

39:45.986 --> 39:47.206
Talk to me. Are you all right?

39:47.231 --> 39:48.399
It's gonna be fine.
We're gonna get help.

39:48.432 --> 39:49.901
- It's gonna be okay.
- Julia.

39:49.934 --> 39:51.402
- Julia.
- Come on. Hey.

39:51.436 --> 39:53.572
- Julia.
- Jules, stay with us. Come on.

39:53.604 --> 39:55.140
Julia?

40:04.538 --> 40:05.873
Hey.

40:08.649 --> 40:10.963
No, don't move around too much.

40:11.182 --> 40:14.205
Sun patched you up, but
it's gonna take a while.

40:16.346 --> 40:18.263
Did she do it?

40:18.994 --> 40:21.408
Did it work? Is it gone?

40:21.944 --> 40:23.680
Yeah.

40:23.705 --> 40:25.533
She did it.

40:26.312 --> 40:28.403
But, Julia...

40:30.317 --> 40:32.364
there was a complication.

40:41.500 --> 40:44.356
- What's wrong with you?
- Lock it up, Q. Seriously!

40:45.012 --> 40:47.382
I can't help Fillory.

40:47.422 --> 40:48.664
I can't help Eliot.

40:48.689 --> 40:50.117
Please, wake up!

40:50.142 --> 40:52.773
- I can't help Julia, and I just want...
