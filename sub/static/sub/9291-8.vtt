00:14.280 --> 00:17.400
- You killed Tariq?
- You can't let Father know.

00:17.480 --> 00:19.640
He wants me dead
because I messed up with Debbie.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.600
You ordered Tariq to kill him.

00:21.680 --> 00:23.480
To kill our own son.

00:23.560 --> 00:26.880
Nothing will stand in the way
of what needs to be done.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.720
Not him, not you.

00:29.800 --> 00:31.680
Your father's following us.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.280
- What?
- It was the only way I could save you.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.280
Mom!

00:39.520 --> 00:42.320
I think I got it.
I can turn off the override

00:42.400 --> 00:45.240
and stop the remaining plants
from melting down.

00:45.320 --> 00:48.120
- I did the best I could, sir. I hope it works.
- So do I.

00:48.200 --> 00:51.800
Edgar, what's going on? Why are some
of the reactors still not shutting down?

00:51.880 --> 00:54.000
Six of them were immune to the kill sequence.

00:54.080 --> 00:59.360
Contact Bauer. Either he finds the people
responsible for planting the override,

00:59.440 --> 01:01.800
or we're looking a nuclear holocaust.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.280
Bauer and Audrey left five minutes ago.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.840
- Where'd they go?
- "Felsted Security."

01:07.640 --> 01:09.920
You're going to need
to set things up on your end.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.840
When Bauer and Audrey Raines are killed,

01:11.920 --> 01:15.440
CTU is going to know
that someone inside leaked their location.

01:15.520 --> 01:17.680
- "Divert suspicion."
- Fine.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.960
The device maintains heat levels
of the reactors.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.920
They can melt down each of those plants.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.720
The man you saw when you
were held captive, he's our only lead.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.280
" Stop. There. I think that's him.

01:29.360 --> 01:31.920
- They're sealing us off.
- Should we call CTU?

01:32.000 --> 01:35.400
No. CTU's been compromised. That's
the only way they'd know we were here.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.040
- Then who are you calling?
- The only person I can trust right now.

01:40.480 --> 01:43.000
I'm empty.

01:46.040 --> 01:47.520
Tony!

01:54.520 --> 01:56.800
Is there any chance this is a mistake,

01:56.880 --> 02:00.320
that the remaining six reactors
are just taking longer to shut down?

02:00.400 --> 02:01.640
No.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.400
Those plants are in the grip of the override,
which has been sealed off.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.920
Did you send the list of cities
to the president?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.160
- Yes.
- What about evacuation procedures?

02:10.240 --> 02:14.480
We alerted the National Guard. We'll see
how the president wants us to proceed.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.440
Ms Driscoll, the president's ready.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.320
OK, put him on. Mr President.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.960
I understand we've been able to shut down
98 nuclear power plants.

02:24.040 --> 02:25.120
Yes, sir.

02:25.200 --> 02:31.400
But it appears that our shutdown will not be
effective with the six remaining reactors.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.640
Not going to be effective?
What exactly does that mean?

02:35.600 --> 02:40.800
I'm afraid it means that we could have
six nuclear disasters on our hands.

02:41.960 --> 02:47.440
What are the casualty projections
if all six plants melt down?

02:47.520 --> 02:52.400
450,000 deaths in the first 24 hours.
Longer-range estimates in the low millions.

02:52.480 --> 02:56.440
And that's not taking into account
the resulting cancers and birth defects.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.680
Why were we able to shut down
the other power plants but not these six?

03:00.760 --> 03:03.720
They're still being controlled by the terrorists.

03:03.800 --> 03:07.400
- Because of the override device?
- Exactly.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.800
We have to find the override device itself.

03:09.880 --> 03:12.520
It's a prototype.
The terrorists have the only one.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.040
Then let's find it.

03:14.400 --> 03:17.120
I'll order the evacuation of those six cities.

03:17.200 --> 03:20.640
- "Jim, keep me posted."
- Yes, Mr President.

03:22.080 --> 03:24.160
All right, let's get back to work.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.240
- Yeah?
- Mr Secretary, it's Jack.

03:28.320 --> 03:31.280
Don't let anyone know it's me.
We've got a problem.

03:31.360 --> 03:34.280
I understand, Marcy.
Let me see what I can do.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.080
- I have to take this call.
- Yes.

03:36.160 --> 03:39.080
" All right.
These are the projected numbers.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
What's going on?

03:40.240 --> 03:44.320
Audrey and I are safe, but there was an
attempt on our lives at Felsted Security.

03:44.400 --> 03:45.400
What?

03:45.480 --> 03:49.320
A group of assassins
took out our entire security detail.

03:49.400 --> 03:53.600
Send a forensic unit to identify the bodies,
but I don't want CTU to know.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.120
Why not?

03:55.200 --> 03:57.880
I think someone at CTU
was complicit in the attack.

03:58.320 --> 03:59.720
How do you know that?

03:59.800 --> 04:05.200
Sir, CTU is the only agency that knew where
we were. No one else had that information.

04:07.080 --> 04:11.600
- Is one of Erin's people with the terrorists?
- I think so. I just don't know who.

04:11.680 --> 04:16.320
But it's clear that they didn't want
Audrey to make the ID of the man she saw.

04:16.399 --> 04:19.240
I'm sending a Secret Service detail
to pick you up.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.520
- Please don't. That's not the right thing to do.
- Why not?

04:22.600 --> 04:26.760
I don't want anyone to know where we are.
That way I know we'll be safe.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.120
How should I handle this?

04:28.200 --> 04:31.200
- Remember the Melbourne situation?
- Yes.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.880
Try that. I think it'll work.

04:33.960 --> 04:34.960
OK.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.800
I've got to go.
I'll get back to you when we're safe.

04:37.880 --> 04:42.160
- Jack, take care of Audrey.
- Yes, sir. I will.

04:48.200 --> 04:52.000
- Are you OK?
- I'm almost getting used to this.

04:53.200 --> 04:54.920
Yeah.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.560
- Is it possible that we've been followed?
- No. We're clear.

04:59.000 --> 05:02.080
- Where are we going?
- We need to lay low for a while.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.000
- What communication do you need?
- A wi-fi and a hardline.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.560
- All right. We'll go back to my place.
- OK.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.720
Thank you, Tony.

05:12.800 --> 05:15.840
Wait till you see it before you thank me.

05:15.920 --> 05:20.000
No, I mean for picking us up,
for saving our lives.

05:22.400 --> 05:27.720
- I'm sure you're wondering what's going on.
- Not really, no.

05:27.800 --> 05:31.120
- Something wrong?
- What could be wrong?

05:31.200 --> 05:34.640
I'm not in federal prison
thanks to you and President Palmer.

05:34.720 --> 05:37.360
Michelle left me. I...

05:38.680 --> 05:43.040
You know what, never mind.
Why don't you tell me what this is all about?

05:43.120 --> 05:45.760
- You heard about Audrey and her father?
- Yeah.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.160
We were at Felsted so Audrey could make an
ID of a man she saw during the kidnapping.

05:50.240 --> 05:53.280
- I don't get it. Why?
- The kidnapping was just a cover.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.800
The terrorists' objective
is to gain control of power plants.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.600
The man that Audrey saw is our only lead.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.640
- I thought you weren't in the field any more.
- I'm not.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.160
The secretary's my responsibility.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.200
I got caught up in it.

06:07.280 --> 06:09.960
Listen to me.
I don't want to get caught up in it.

06:10.040 --> 06:14.360
So you do whatever you need to do
at my place. I'm staying out of it, all right?

06:14.440 --> 06:16.240
Understood.

06:21.040 --> 06:25.720
Today continues to be a challenge
to the strength of the American spirit.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.400
We have a condition in six cities
across the United States

06:29.480 --> 06:33.520
in which nuclear power facilities
may become unstable.

06:33.600 --> 06:36.680
While we work to regain control
over these facilities,

06:36.760 --> 06:40.640
I am also asking our National Guard
to assist local authorities

06:40.720 --> 06:44.480
to effect an immediate evacuation
of those six cities.

06:44.560 --> 06:49.080
This evacuation is only being issued
for all persons living or working within...

06:49.160 --> 06:53.320
The president didn't mention
that there isn't time for complete evacuation.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.840
If those reactors melt down,

06:55.920 --> 06:59.320
there'll be at least 50,000 dead per city.

06:59.400 --> 07:02.200
We still have time
to find a way to prevent that.

07:02.280 --> 07:06.520
I can tell you now, Erin, the chances
of doing that from here are very low.

07:06.600 --> 07:11.400
We have to find the people
who have the override device.

07:11.480 --> 07:14.480
What about the hospitals north of there?

07:15.640 --> 07:17.720
All right. Keep checking.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.680
- I called Dina's sister. There's no answer.
- I'll take care of it.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.960
- You and Ravi check the station again.
- OK.

07:25.840 --> 07:30.000
The Americans have been able
to shut down most of the reactors.

07:30.080 --> 07:33.400
- How many are under our control?
- Six.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.720
More than enough to break their will.

07:35.800 --> 07:41.000
I'll have to manage the override personally.
Make sure those six melt down on schedule.

07:41.080 --> 07:43.840
- Is there anything I can do?
- Yes.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.360
Take care of your mess.

07:46.440 --> 07:48.640
Don't worry, Marwan.
I give you my word.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.720
My wife and son will be dead
by the end of this day.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.120
- We have to get you to a hospital.
- No.

08:06.200 --> 08:10.680
Your father knows I've been shot.
He'll be looking for us in all the hospitals.

08:10.760 --> 08:13.560
We're going to have to take a chance.
You're hurt.

08:13.640 --> 08:15.640
- I'll be OK.
- No, you won't.

08:15.720 --> 08:19.160
You need to get to a doctor.
I'm not afraid of Father.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.240
You should be.

08:21.320 --> 08:24.200
He tried to kill me,
and then he did this to you.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.440
He is not my father any more.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.480
Mom, please.

08:33.559 --> 08:38.760
All right. Drop me off at an emergency room,
but then you have to drive away.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.840
No. Whatever happens,
we're staying together.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.880
I'm running a filter for Driscoll.
Could you baby-sit it?

08:52.960 --> 08:55.160
- Sure.
- Thanks.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.640
- " Yes?"
- I couldn't take your call. I was in a meeting.

09:24.720 --> 09:28.400
- Bauer and Audrey Raines are alive.
- My information was accurate.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.000
Yes. Their location was correct,
but they survived the attack.

09:32.080 --> 09:35.080
- Are they headed back to CTU?
- I haven't heard anything.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.680
- Bauer didn't call in?
- "Not that I'm aware of."

09:38.760 --> 09:41.400
That doesn't make sense.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.080
It makes perfect sense.

09:43.160 --> 09:46.880
He knows there's been a breach
and he's told someone. I gotta get out.

09:46.960 --> 09:50.440
No. You have to stay in
until we take care of Bauer and the woman.

09:50.520 --> 09:53.560
What about me?
I won't spend the rest of my life in jail.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.920
You'll be taken care of.
You know that. Now, go.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.360
There you are.

10:05.440 --> 10:08.400
- What?
- Division's waiting for those projections.

10:08.480 --> 10:11.320
- They're ready to be sent.
- Then send them.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.840
Yeah?

10:22.920 --> 10:26.800
Sir, your assistant Scott Borman just arrived.
Should I send him in?

10:28.120 --> 10:30.520
Thanks.

10:30.600 --> 10:33.800
Mr Secretary,
it's good to see you safe and sound, sir.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.720
Thanks, Scott. Sit down.

10:36.760 --> 10:40.160
- Is there a problem, sir?
- There's a big problem.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.680
Someone inside CTU is leaking information
to someone on the outside.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.960
- What do you need me to do?
- I need you to go to Erin Driscoll.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.360
Tell her that Jack Bauer
is no longer at Felsted Security

10:51.440 --> 10:56.240
and that he's watching surveillance videos
at the old CTU substation in Torrance.

10:56.320 --> 11:00.440
- Anything about when Jack will call?
- When they identify the man Audrey saw.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.680
I take it Jack and Audrey
are nowhere near the substation?

11:03.760 --> 11:06.640
Right. We're trying to flush out the mole.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.640
Then you'll need me to put a DOD Comsat
envelope around this place.

11:10.720 --> 11:14.880
If anyone sends out a communication
containing the information you planted,

11:14.960 --> 11:17.000
that's the spy.

11:17.080 --> 11:20.040
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

11:47.560 --> 11:51.640
Watch your step,
the dog next door likes our yard.

11:59.120 --> 12:02.080
Well, here we are. Home, sweet home.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.720
Just stay here.

12:17.360 --> 12:20.280
- Oh, God! Who the hell are you?
- Jack, it's OK.

12:21.840 --> 12:26.560
- This is my friend, Jen.
- Tell him to play with his guns outside.

12:26.640 --> 12:29.840
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.400
I'm sorry.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.640
- I thought you were working.
- I'm going in late.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.720
This is Jack and his friend Audrey.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.120
This is Jen.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.920
Hi.

12:42.000 --> 12:46.000
I saw you on TV today. You're the daughter
of the secretary of defense.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.840
You and your old man
were kidnapped this morning.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.720
- Yeah.
- What's going on?

12:52.600 --> 12:55.320
- I'm helping them out.
- Could you be more specific?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.360
We need to use Tony's computer.

12:57.440 --> 13:00.480
What, they don't have computers
where you work?

13:01.320 --> 13:06.600
Listen, we have a situation here, all right?
They need to lie low for a little bit.

13:06.680 --> 13:09.400
We can't let anybody know
they're here, all right?

13:09.480 --> 13:12.120
Whatever. I'm leaving, anyway.

13:12.200 --> 13:15.080
- Tony.
- Jen, you can't go anywhere.

13:15.160 --> 13:19.400
- Why not?
- We can't leave till Jack and Audrey take off.

13:19.480 --> 13:23.120
- We can't take a chance.
- What kind of chance? I work at a bar.

13:23.200 --> 13:27.480
- I'm sorry, Jen. We're not gonna be long.
- Stay as long as you want. I have a job.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.840
He doesn't.

13:31.120 --> 13:34.320
Jen, can I talk to you for a second?

13:36.840 --> 13:39.080
Please.

13:43.040 --> 13:44.880
Sorry.

13:44.960 --> 13:47.200
No, she seems real sweet.

13:48.040 --> 13:51.000
Look, we were fighting for our lives
a few minutes ago.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.560
If it hadn't been for Tony,
we'd have been dead.

13:53.640 --> 13:58.480
I've been through a lot today and I'm sure
when this is over, your boss will understand.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.640
And if he doesn't?

14:00.720 --> 14:03.760
I can have him killed.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.920
- Knock yourself out.
- Thank you.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.960
How are you guys making out?

14:11.040 --> 14:13.120
I have to convert this so I can read it,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.920
and then hopefully you can make an ID
from the surveillance video.

14:17.000 --> 14:21.440
- I have some software for that. I'll dig it out.
- Thanks.

14:21.520 --> 14:24.640
You told me about Tony,
but I didn't know Michelle left him.

14:24.720 --> 14:29.400
- Yeah, after he got out of prison.
- I thought he went to prison because of her.

14:29.480 --> 14:32.520
He saved her life
and she paid him back by leaving him?

14:32.600 --> 14:36.960
That's the way Tony sees it too.
It didn't happen exactly like that.

14:37.040 --> 14:42.240
When he got out of prison he was angry. He
couldn't get a job. I don't think he wanted one.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.560
He started drinking.

14:44.640 --> 14:47.280
And he pushed her away.

14:47.360 --> 14:51.440
- What is she doing now?
- She's a deputy director over at Division.

14:51.520 --> 14:55.240
- I hope he can help us.
- If he can, he will.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.280
- Here we go.
- You got it?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.960
Yeah, got it right here.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.200
Thanks.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.600
We're in.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.720
- Did you start the ball rolling with Driscoll?
- Yep. I'm headed to her briefing.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.080
She won't be happy when she knows
we're using her to find the mole.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.280
I'm surprised you felt the need
to keep her in the dark.

15:24.360 --> 15:29.280
As long as there's a leak in CTU,
we keep everyone in the dark.

15:36.200 --> 15:39.120
Make sure you're on line
and your databases are unlocked.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.880
As soon as Jack sends the image, we need to
move as quickly as possible to make this ID.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.360
Why is Jack doing this at the old substation?

15:46.440 --> 15:49.440
There's technical reasons.
I didn't speak with him.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.160
- Who did?
- I did.

15:52.640 --> 15:57.320
He also asked that his whereabouts
be kept strictly internal until he contacts us.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.880
All right. Let's go.

16:31.960 --> 16:35.400
Old CTU substation in Torrance.

16:43.560 --> 16:47.240
I remember this lady.
We saw him around here.

16:48.120 --> 16:50.440
There he is.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.720
- Are you sure that's him?
- Yes.

16:56.800 --> 17:00.400
- I'll route this through the DC office.
- " I was there on Friday."

17:00.480 --> 17:04.920
Tony, she's on the phone.
We can't have her making calls.

17:09.000 --> 17:12.880
- " Give me the phone.
- I can't go to work, I can't talk on the phone?

17:12.960 --> 17:14.760
- Give me the phone.
- Go to hell!

17:14.839 --> 17:17.560
- Give me the damn phone!
- Fine!

17:25.599 --> 17:28.000
- Go ahead.
- Thanks.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.680
- This is Marcy.
- "It's Jack."

17:36.760 --> 17:39.040
I'm sending you the image we need ID'd.

17:39.120 --> 17:41.920
- We're ready to receive.
- OK.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.080
- You're positive this came from her system?
- Yeah.

17:47.160 --> 17:52.160
The voices were digitised, but we were able
to make out the words "CTU substation".

17:52.240 --> 17:53.880
- Where's security?
- On their way.

17:53.960 --> 17:55.960
Thanks, Scott.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.600
Yes, Mr Secretary?

18:01.680 --> 18:05.000
- Erin, there's been a breach in CTU.
- What?

18:05.080 --> 18:09.280
- The information Scott gave you is false.
- What do you mean, false?

18:09.360 --> 18:14.280
Jack and Audrey were ambushed
at Felsted Security. They survived the attack,

18:14.360 --> 18:19.000
but it's clear
that someone in this office gave them up.

18:19.080 --> 18:23.200
With all due respect, sir,
you knew about this and you didn't tell me?

18:23.640 --> 18:27.360
Being left out is not something
you should be concerned about.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.160
I assume you're telling me because
your operation yielded a result.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.360
Yes, it did. Read that.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.160
- Where is she?
- She's about to be taken into custody.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.240
Join me.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.840
- Ms Driscoll, what's going on?
- Go with these men.

19:26.920 --> 19:29.200
- What for?
- You're under arrest, Gavin.

19:29.280 --> 19:33.640
- You've been passing classified information.
- What?

19:33.720 --> 19:36.520
- What are you talking about?
- Take her to holding.

19:36.600 --> 19:39.120
Holding? Ms Driscoll!

19:39.200 --> 19:43.680
What are you doing?
Ms Driscoll, I haven't done anything.

19:43.760 --> 19:46.400
Ms Driscoll, this is a mistake.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.840
What is happening?

19:51.600 --> 19:55.720
Will you tell me what's going on?
I didn't do anything. Please!

19:55.800 --> 19:58.120
Get back to work.

20:15.720 --> 20:20.240
I don't care how you divide up her files. I want
everything off her system and sent to me.

20:20.320 --> 20:24.040
- And enter new pass codes.
- We can'tjust do this on your authority.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.640
Edgar.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.760
- It's OK.
- But he works for DOD, not CTU.

20:28.840 --> 20:31.400
Well, he's the one that found the mole, right?

20:31.480 --> 20:36.120
And Heller wants him to have joint authority.
Finish up here and get back to station two.

20:36.200 --> 20:40.000
The program you set up for the reactors
is almost finished compiling.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.320
- Can I see this?
- Sure.

20:43.800 --> 20:45.960
What makes you so sure Sarah's the mole?

20:46.040 --> 20:48.680
She sent out encoded information
about Bauer.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.920
She wouldn't compromise
Bauer or the investigation.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.520
That's how she fooled us.
She's the last person you'd expect to do it.

20:55.600 --> 20:58.480
All right. Just give me those files.

21:00.720 --> 21:05.600
It's right here. "2:22pm, message sent.
Old CTU substation in Torrance."

21:05.680 --> 21:08.640
It doesn't seem weird
that she'd leave it on her system?

21:08.720 --> 21:11.760
- It was encrypted.
- With a Bainbridge algorithm.

21:11.840 --> 21:15.000
It's so old school it's like saying
"Please decode me".

21:15.080 --> 21:20.160
Let's face it,
Sarah wasn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.

21:24.840 --> 21:28.920
Please, Ms Driscoll. I promise you
there's been some kind of mistake.

21:29.000 --> 21:34.680
How? Your system was isolated, the message
was sent from it while you were there.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.240
Somebody set me up.
It's the only explanation.

21:37.320 --> 21:38.920
Tell me how.

21:39.000 --> 21:42.360
Someone backed into my system,
planted something.

21:42.440 --> 21:45.080
We checked.
None of them were compromised.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.360
Let's stop playing games.

21:47.440 --> 21:52.160
Thousands of lives are at stake. Where
are the people who control the override?

21:52.240 --> 21:55.560
I don't know. That's what I was working on.

21:56.960 --> 22:00.880
- Who did you send the message to?
- I didn't.

22:00.960 --> 22:02.760
Ms Driscoll...

22:03.640 --> 22:07.520
I would never betray our country
or endanger lives. You know that.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.960
Is it the contact who coordinated the attempt
on Jack and Audrey's life at Felsted Security?

22:12.040 --> 22:16.200
- I don't know. It wasn't me.
- I learned my lesson today with Sherek

22:16.280 --> 22:20.880
and I am no longer gonna err
on the side of caution in these interrogations.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.560
Do you get my meaning?

22:25.280 --> 22:27.200
I don't know what to say.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.000
Eric, no!

22:37.080 --> 22:39.440
Please don't do this.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.720
Eric! Ms Driscoll!

22:53.400 --> 22:56.640
- Please stop.
- If you want it to stop,

22:56.720 --> 23:01.280
you tell me
where the Dobson override is and who has it.

23:01.360 --> 23:03.520
I swear I don't know anything.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.200
Wait!

23:14.080 --> 23:20.080
There has got to be an explanation for this.
You've got to give me some time to think.

23:32.520 --> 23:35.960
Talk to me, Sarah. Talk to me.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.840
Ms Driscoll...

23:39.120 --> 23:42.000
I'm not a spy.

23:42.080 --> 23:45.360
I'm not. Please believe me.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.280
Ms Driscoll, please.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.240
- I'm concerned.
- Do you think you can break her in time?

23:56.320 --> 23:59.280
I can break her in time if she's guilty.

24:00.360 --> 24:03.800
According to Scott,
there is no way that this could be a mistake.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.640
I agree it's hard evidence,

24:06.720 --> 24:11.440
but I've known Sarah for eight months
and she doesn't fit the profile.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.480
How do you want to handle it?

24:14.560 --> 24:18.600
I'll watch for a few more minutes,
then I'll go back in.

24:18.680 --> 24:21.200
I'll brief Jack.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.080
Eric, please!

24:24.560 --> 24:27.200
Please!

24:27.280 --> 24:30.400
Eric! Eric, no!

24:30.960 --> 24:33.080
What are you doing?

24:33.160 --> 24:36.440
I'm checking the surveillance
to see who he was talking to.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.440
- Did you find anything?
- No, not yet.

24:40.320 --> 24:43.880
- Anybody want a beer?
- I could use one.

24:49.600 --> 24:51.960
- This is Bauer.
- " We found our mole."

24:52.040 --> 24:55.400
- Who is it?
- Sarah Gavin. Works in comm.

24:55.480 --> 24:58.920
- Is she working alone?
- As far as we know.

24:59.000 --> 25:03.200
I'll call Marcy, tell her the CTU channels
are open. We'll start sharing data.

25:03.280 --> 25:06.200
How's Audrey doing?

25:06.280 --> 25:08.360
She's good. She's resting.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.200
I think now would be a good time
to have her picked up.

25:11.280 --> 25:14.480
We're at 21408, Kipling, North Hollywood.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.440
What's there?

25:16.520 --> 25:18.560
A friend.

25:18.640 --> 25:20.760
I'll send the Secret Service.

25:20.840 --> 25:23.040
Thank you, sir.

25:26.680 --> 25:30.080
Your father's sending someone over
to take you back to CTU.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.320
OK.

25:44.920 --> 25:49.720
Don't you think you've made me
miss enough TV today, Jack?

25:57.120 --> 25:59.800
Why didn't you ever call me?

26:00.560 --> 26:02.440
For what?

26:02.520 --> 26:05.200
I've been there. I could help.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.560
I'm considered a traitor to this country.

26:14.640 --> 26:17.080
My wife left me.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.160
So how are you gonna help me, huh, Jack?

26:21.160 --> 26:23.640
Yeah.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.520
Look...

26:32.000 --> 26:35.200
I owed you for getting me out of prison,

26:36.280 --> 26:38.760
but today I repaid that debt.

26:39.640 --> 26:42.320
To tell you the truth,

26:42.400 --> 26:46.000
all you do is remind me of a past
I'm trying to forget.

26:47.040 --> 26:49.120
So why don't you do me a favour?

26:49.560 --> 26:52.400
Do what you need to do here,

26:52.480 --> 26:54.880
and let's leave it at that.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.960
All right?

26:58.560 --> 27:00.360
Yeah.

27:25.960 --> 27:27.760
How did this happen?

27:27.840 --> 27:33.840
I was working in the yard and backed
into a nail that sticks out of our gate.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.200
Ow.

27:40.440 --> 27:43.200
This looks like a gunshot wound.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.120
I'm afraid it was nothing that exciting, Doctor.

27:47.200 --> 27:52.160
It was my fault.
I was supposed to fix that gate last week.

27:52.960 --> 27:57.320
All right. You're gonna need a tetanus shot.
Then I'll stitch it up.

27:57.400 --> 27:59.440
Thank you, Doctor.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.240
Yeah. I'll be right back.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.320
Go watch him.

28:17.600 --> 28:21.080
- What's going on?
- He said something to the nurse.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.360
Did he make a phone call?

28:24.440 --> 28:27.480
- Not that I could see.
- Did she?

28:27.560 --> 28:30.080
- No.
- Good.

28:34.360 --> 28:37.040
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad
if they called the police.

28:37.120 --> 28:40.520
- The police could protect us from Father.
- It would be bad.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.520
To go to jail for the rest of our lives?

28:43.600 --> 28:46.200
That's what would happen.

28:52.080 --> 28:54.400
Where are we going to go
after we leave here?

28:54.480 --> 28:58.920
If we can get out of the city and stay
somewhere for a couple of days,

28:59.000 --> 29:02.320
I can arrange for us to get out of the country.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.280
- Yeah?
- "Jack, it's Marcy. We got a match."

29:18.360 --> 29:20.440
- Who is it?
- "His name is Henry Powell."

29:20.520 --> 29:25.680
- "I've posted everything on the secure site."
- Hold on a second.

29:27.640 --> 29:28.640
OK. I got it.

29:28.720 --> 29:31.760
He was a computer consultant
for McLennen-Forster.

29:31.840 --> 29:33.080
Wait a second.

29:33.160 --> 29:36.520
They designed the device
controlling the power plants.

29:36.600 --> 29:40.160
He's not there any more,
but he freelances for them. He's in LA.

29:40.240 --> 29:42.560
- How do you know?
- He's trying to leave the city.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.880
He's scheduled a chopper
to meet him in Van Nuys in 15 minutes.

29:45.960 --> 29:50.840
- I thought air traffic had been grounded.
- It is. He got a special clearance.

29:50.920 --> 29:54.920
- Son of a bitch. Where in Van Nuys?
- "The helipad at the Larchmont building."

29:55.000 --> 29:58.240
I want you to ground his flight,
but not until I get there.

29:58.320 --> 30:00.400
- They're here.
- "Can you make it in time?"

30:00.480 --> 30:04.560
I'm gonna try.
Go get your things. We've got to go.

30:09.560 --> 30:11.840
- Davis, Secret Service.
- Jack Bauer.

30:11.920 --> 30:14.920
- Take Audrey back to CTU.
- Those are our orders.

30:15.000 --> 30:18.640
- OK. You got a car for me?
- It's right over there.

30:18.720 --> 30:21.160
Thank you. Audrey, they're ready.

30:21.760 --> 30:25.000
This is Agent Davis.
He's gonna take care of you.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.240
- Be careful.
- I will. You too.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.560
- "CTU."
- It's Jack. Let me speak to Erin Driscoll.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.120
Right away.

30:39.560 --> 30:42.760
I just got the file on Henry Powell.
I'm going through it now.

30:42.840 --> 30:45.280
He's leaving the city.
I have to get to Van Nuys.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.000
- You want air backup?
- No. I want a low profile.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.840
- I don't want to spook him.
- A ground package is gonna be 30 minutes.

30:51.920 --> 30:54.720
- That's too long.
- When is his flight due to take off?

30:54.800 --> 30:57.360
- Less than 15 minutes.
- "What do you want to do?"

30:57.440 --> 31:00.840
He's most likely on his own.
I'll have to handle this myself.

31:00.920 --> 31:04.480
- All right. I'll send a team anyway.
- I'll be in touch.

31:04.560 --> 31:07.520
- What will you handle by yourself?
- It's covered.

31:07.600 --> 31:12.520
It would be pretty stupid of me to let you die
after I risked my life trying to save you.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.200
Could you use my help?

31:17.320 --> 31:19.840
- Yeah.
- All right. Let's go.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.040
- Curtis.
- Yeah, Edgar?

31:52.120 --> 31:54.200
- Has Sarah confessed to anything?
- No.

31:54.280 --> 32:00.280
- What are they doing to her?
- Don't worry about it. Just get back to work.

32:08.400 --> 32:10.880
Curtis, what did Edgar want?

32:10.960 --> 32:13.520
- Why?
- Let him know we need his full attention.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.200
Get back to your station.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.400
What's that?

32:31.480 --> 32:35.840
Just something to numb the arm
so that I can close the wound.

32:35.920 --> 32:38.280
OK.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.360
I really wish you'd let me admit you.

32:40.440 --> 32:44.280
This wound is serious.
There's a chance of an infection here.

32:44.360 --> 32:48.760
No, Doctor, please.
Do whatever you can and we'll leave.

32:48.840 --> 32:53.040
- Behrooz, where are you going?
- I'll be right back, Mom.

33:02.560 --> 33:04.880
- The police are here.
- Did you call them?

33:04.960 --> 33:07.600
- This is a gunshot wound.
- I told you it wasn't.

33:07.680 --> 33:11.560
- Then why are you acting so strangely?
- Let's go.

33:11.640 --> 33:14.160
You shouldn't leave! You need treatment!

33:14.240 --> 33:15.720
Susan! Susan!

33:17.240 --> 33:19.040
Wait.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.640
Let's go.

33:27.560 --> 33:29.880
Come on. Come on.

34:21.600 --> 34:23.679
Marianne?

34:23.760 --> 34:24.760
What is it?

34:24.840 --> 34:27.199
You asked me
to bump up your security clearance.

34:27.280 --> 34:31.159
I was a little busy with the override,
but I finally got it for you.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.239
Great. Thanks.

34:36.600 --> 34:37.639
What?

34:37.719 --> 34:43.120
You'll need to pick a password.
I set up the screen on server five.

34:47.400 --> 34:52.239
There you go. Use the same password
as the one that unlocks your system files.

34:52.320 --> 34:54.040
OK.

35:36.040 --> 35:37.560
Edgar.

35:39.680 --> 35:42.440
- Why do you keep looking at me?
- I don't.

35:42.520 --> 35:44.600
Let's go outside. I want to talk to you.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.680
I don't want to talk to you.
I have a lot of work to do.

35:47.760 --> 35:50.440
It is getting incredibly tedious, Edgar,

35:50.520 --> 35:56.600
to have to remind you repeatedly that I could
step into Driscoll's office and have you fired.

36:03.240 --> 36:06.320
- Curtis. I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

36:06.400 --> 36:09.040
- Walk with me to Driscoll's office.
- Walk with you?

36:09.120 --> 36:11.600
Please, Curtis.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.960
Let's go.

36:24.720 --> 36:27.200
If Sarah is guilty, we shouldn't need...

36:27.280 --> 36:29.080
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What is it?

36:29.160 --> 36:32.600
- You got the wrong one. Sarah's not guilty.
- How do you know?

36:32.680 --> 36:38.520
I just sneaked into Marianne's system. She
used Sarah's to communicate outside of CTU.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.560
Sarah's station was isolated from the subnet.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.920
- She didn't use it.
- How did she do it?

36:44.000 --> 36:47.160
- She use a plain old AC power line.
- What?

36:47.240 --> 36:51.760
That's the last place anybody would
ever look. Plus it has plenty of bandwidth.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.160
Where is she?

36:58.040 --> 37:02.120
She's trying to leave the building.
Lock down the exits!

37:06.360 --> 37:08.520
There she goes!

37:15.000 --> 37:17.960
She's heading out the southwest side door.
Side door.

37:34.120 --> 37:36.520
You're under arrest.

37:38.960 --> 37:42.520
Examine the contents.
Impound the car, strip and search it.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.920
I got her.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.080
- Mr Powell?
- Yeah, let's go.

38:17.160 --> 38:18.960
- We can't.
- What?

38:19.040 --> 38:23.160
- The flight's been grounded.
- McLennen-Forster has special ordinance.

38:23.240 --> 38:26.120
- I know, but the order was superseded.
- By who?

38:26.200 --> 38:29.080
The Department of Defense.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.240
- You're going to fly me out of here.
- Please. Sir!

38:34.320 --> 38:36.640
Now! Get in.

38:47.400 --> 38:52.440
- All right. Where are we going?
- Just get us in the air and fly east.

39:07.440 --> 39:09.200
There it is.

39:27.080 --> 39:29.000
" Do not take off!

39:29.080 --> 39:32.840
- Do not take off!
- Get us in the air! Go! Go!

39:32.920 --> 39:35.160
- Shut it down!
- " I said now!

39:35.240 --> 39:38.120
Come on! Move! Hurry up!

39:38.560 --> 39:41.840
Drop the weapon now! Now!

39:42.920 --> 39:45.640
Step out! Get down! Now!

39:45.720 --> 39:49.080
Get out of the helicopter. Move! Move!

39:49.160 --> 39:51.480
Let me see your hands! Now!

39:52.760 --> 39:54.760
Get up!

39:56.160 --> 39:57.160
Move!

39:57.600 --> 40:01.480
Where are you taking me?
I haven't done anything.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.720
Put your hands on the roof of the truck.

40:03.800 --> 40:07.600
- The people I know, they'll pay you.
- Shut up!

40:10.520 --> 40:13.320
I got his cellphone! Bring me the bag!

40:14.600 --> 40:16.640
Put your hands behind your back.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.720
Who are you guys? Police? FBI?

41:06.120 --> 41:10.280
- Actually, I'm currently unemployed.
- I'll make it worth your while.

41:10.720 --> 41:13.120
- Put him in the back.
- Come on.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.440
He's dead, Jack.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.960
Dammit!

41:55.960 --> 41:59.000
