different level to the rest of us.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.361

03:28.640 --> 03:31.610
For one thing, he's not afraid
of the things that scare most kids.

Did you know the Indians
that used to live around here

03:46.480 --> 03:47.606
thought this place was haunted?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.730
Legend says, that the guardians
of their spirit world

03:51.800 --> 03:53.689
lived in the rocks and the trees,

come back into our world.

the whole world's gonna end.

36:44.360 --> 36:45.441
Yeah?

36:47.120 --> 36:49.441
I think there's something else in the house.

36:50.960 --> 36:52.803
Hold on. Please. Let's not start...

36:52.880 --> 36:55.611
I mean, how do you explain the matches?

36:55.680 --> 36:57.648
How do you explain the smells?

36:57.800 --> 36:59.962
How do you explain the weird noises?

37:00.040 --> 37:01.963
It's not ghosts, honey.

37:02.600 --> 37:07.970
It's just Michael's autism
manifesting itself in a new way.

37:08.120 --> 37:10.487
Stop being a jerk and listen.

37:10.960 --> 37:13.850

37:13.960 --> 37:17.601
Peter, maybe there is something here.

37:17.680 --> 37:22.607
And I don't know.
Maybe it's some kind of karma.

37:24.160 --> 37:27.642
Karma? Karma for what?
Bad things that we've done?

37:29.200 --> 37:32.886

really believe that crap? Do ya?

NARRATOR: The Anasazi were an ancient
culture that lived in the Colorado Plateau.

38:55.560 --> 38:58.484
No one knows why they
built their fortified cities.

38:58.560 --> 39:02.406
But we do know that their entire
civilization ended suddenly

39:02.480 --> 39:04.164
when they abandoned their homes.

39:04.240 --> 39:08.245
Some have speculated that the nature
spirits worshipped by the Anasazi

39:08.320 --> 39:13.168
became destructive demons when the community
ceased to maintain their sacred laws.

39:13.600 --> 39:16.843
These beings appeared in the form
of a coyote, snake,

39:16.920 --> 39:19.491
crow, buffalo and wolf.

39:19.560 --> 39:21.608
They terrorized the population.

39:21.680 --> 39:25.082
Often appearing to children
before taking them away forever.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.081

of the year is going to look like.

at the regular staff meetings.

- This guy on the Internet...
- Honey, can I talk?

44:16.920 --> 44:21.286
He charges women whose husbands have
too much money to stare at them.

44:21.360 --> 44:22.486
- That's what they do.
- No. Seriously?

44:22.560 --> 44:24.688
Yeah, right? I told you
they stare at women. They go...

44:24.760 --> 44:26.649
- "Okay, here's $1,000."
- Yeah, that's all he does.

about all that airy-fairy

59:56.960 --> 01:00:00.923

years back, our little guy was,

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.970

Like we thought we were
going to lose him, sick.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:14.130
So we took him to all kinds of doctors
and specialists and nobody knew anything.

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:15.247
Nothing helped.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.448
So, a friend of our friend...

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.966

she was telling us about, you'd laugh.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.771
and then four weeks later,
he's playing baseball.

It's a very important area.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.890
It's the home of the Anasazi.

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:49.566
The people the Navajo Indians
call the ancient ones.

01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:53.131
It's said they communed
with very powerful spirits.

01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:57.486
Throwers and Forest Dwellers
and Shadow Creatures.

01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.568
And they had rituals
to keep the ancient demons

01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:01.369
trapped in another dimension.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.644
A place called the third world.

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:07.007
Yeah, yeah. I read something about that.

01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:09.082
That is why the Anasazi kept
their rituals hidden

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.080
so no one could open the doorways
and let these beings cross into our world.

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.846
So you're saying that's real?

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.048
(TERESA CONTINUES SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.567
Hmm.

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:32.246
There are five demons
that were mostly feared.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.243
But their name cannot be spoken.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:38.449
It's known that they manifest
physically as a crow,

01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:40.841
a coyote, a snake,

01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.890
a buffalo or a wolf.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:46.764
That's not their true form.

01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:50.448
If all five spirits appear,
it will be disastrous.

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.691
What do they want?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.766
They bring out the darkness within people,

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:58.446
so their victims destroy themselves
or destroy each other.

01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:06.362
(TERESA CONTINUES SPEAKING IN SPANISH)

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:16.289

She says we must hurry.

01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.367
They won't stop until
they get what they want.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:26.730
We'll begin by performing
a clearing of the house.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.043
Closing any portals
and banishing any dark spirits.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:37.801
Dark forces exist everywhere.

01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.882
Do you believe in any higher power?

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.721
Not really.

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.643
Now would be a good time to start.

01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:48.810
Aren't you going to need that?

01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.730
She's sensing older things at work here.

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:57.051

with cannot help you now.
