WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:26.459 --> 01:28.984
Ah, what a perfect day for my birthday.

01:38.037 --> 01:40.096
Hi Teela, terrific day, isn't it?

01:41.607 --> 01:44.701
Yeah, it's a nice day,
nothing special though.

01:46.512 --> 01:47.713
Gotta go now.

01:47.713 --> 01:50.546
I never thought she'd forget my birthday.

01:50.550 --> 01:52.550
She must have something
more important on her mind.

01:52.585 --> 01:54.047
I'll see you later then, my dear.

01:58.624 --> 02:01.961
Good morning, Sire.
Isn't this a beautiful day for a...

02:01.961 --> 02:04.259
Hmm, yes.
Seems like a pleasant enough day.

02:04.463 --> 02:09.481
for a... birthday. I can't believe it.
Someone's gotta remember what today is.

02:09.668 --> 02:11.226
I know! Chef Alan!

02:11.470 --> 02:14.496
He probably will make a birthday
cake for me, right this minute.

02:16.008 --> 02:19.671
No, not right now.
I'm very busy, Orko.

02:19.878 --> 02:21.607
But... but Chef Alan, it... it's my...

02:21.947 --> 02:23.582
I'm sorry, Orko...

02:23.582 --> 02:25.417
I just don't have any time to talk now.

02:25.417 --> 02:27.078
I... I'm very busy... very busy.

02:28.687 --> 02:31.724
Oh...
You'd think someone...

02:31.724 --> 02:35.490
would remember.
[sigh] But no, everybody's busy. No

02:35.630 --> 02:36.630
time for old Orko.

02:38.297 --> 02:41.300
-Happy birthday, Orko.
-Now, that's one beautiful

02:41.300 --> 02:43.996
cake. Chef Alan's outdone himself.

02:45.838 --> 02:48.474
He thinks we've all forgotten his birthday.

02:48.474 --> 02:51.773
-I really think we have Orko fooled.
-Yeah, surprise party and all.

02:52.144 --> 02:54.213
It's gonna be a great birthday for him.

02:54.213 --> 02:57.671
Oh, I thought I'd find you both here.
-Father! What is it?

02:58.317 --> 03:00.979
Well, there are problems in the province of

03:01.186 --> 03:03.017
Basilia. Strange things are happening.

03:03.222 --> 03:05.816
Disrupting the area, destroying property.

03:06.091 --> 03:09.527
I wouldn't be surprised if
Skeletor were at the bottom of all of this.

03:09.862 --> 03:12.626
I'll set up my troops
and get right out there.

03:13.332 --> 03:15.960
I'll contact Ram-Man. He maybe of help.

03:16.168 --> 03:18.762
Thanks, tell him we'll meet in Basilia.

03:20.172 --> 03:23.005
Cringer, we've got work ahead of us.

03:28.681 --> 03:32.117
C'mon, Cringer. We've gotta get to Basilia.

03:33.085 --> 03:36.680
Oh, I... I'd rather stay
back here with that cake.

03:37.423 --> 03:40.187
By the power of Grayskull!

03:46.598 --> 03:50.432
I have the power!

04:05.918 --> 04:07.545
Come on, Battle Cat.

04:08.420 --> 04:12.049
Let's go, but I'd still
like a piece of that cake.

04:15.294 --> 04:18.422
Some friends they are.
They don't even want to see me today...

04:18.630 --> 04:20.392
and it's my birthday.

04:20.565 --> 04:22.193
But does anyone care?

04:22.468 --> 04:24.265
Wait!

04:24.603 --> 04:27.766
The Sorceress! She's always glad to see me.
I'll go visit her.

04:33.278 --> 04:35.647
What's happening?
What's causing this?

04:35.647 --> 04:37.774
C'mon, let's get outta here.

04:51.029 --> 04:52.997
Find cover and stay there.

04:53.332 --> 04:56.790
Phew! That was a little too
close for anyone's comfort.

04:57.603 --> 04:59.537
Oh, I'm glad He-Man's here.

05:00.506 --> 05:02.098
Look, a whirlwind.

05:02.307 --> 05:03.934
Let's just unwind it.

05:20.325 --> 05:21.451
Gotcha.

05:31.303 --> 05:33.430
Uh, I'll get this one.

05:35.207 --> 05:36.572
Way to go!

05:41.046 --> 05:43.105
He-Man, behind you!

05:44.917 --> 05:46.578
I'll take care of it.

05:48.787 --> 05:50.550
Use your sword, He-Man!

05:50.856 --> 05:52.721
I can't! It's gone!

05:53.892 --> 05:56.053
It's coming right at us.
Get out of the way, everyone!

06:00.132 --> 06:01.292
It's stopped!

06:02.301 --> 06:04.667
Uh, It's changing direction.

06:05.070 --> 06:06.371
Look over there!

06:06.371 --> 06:08.464
What do ya think's going on?

06:11.310 --> 06:13.612
I'm not sure, but...

06:13.612 --> 06:15.079
we'll find out, whatever it is.

06:15.581 --> 06:18.641
Duh, I'll stay here and help clean up the

06:19.017 --> 06:20.279
mess.
Good.

06:21.386 --> 06:23.377
Guards, stay and help him.

06:25.257 --> 06:27.493
I'll meet you at Man-At-Arms' workshop.

06:27.493 --> 06:29.290
Fine... and thanks for your help.

06:29.595 --> 06:31.426
Thanks for yours.

06:32.965 --> 06:34.933
It's gone!  Disappeared!

06:44.877 --> 06:46.003
Uh, sorry.

06:48.046 --> 06:50.606
Thank goodness you're here, He-Man.
Wait till I tell ya about...

06:50.883 --> 06:53.044
Woah, Orko, slow down.

06:54.887 --> 06:56.445
What's all the commotion?

06:56.722 --> 06:58.553
It's gone.  Disappeared.

06:59.157 --> 07:02.327
You're right, Duncan.
Something very strange was going on...

07:02.327 --> 07:04.229
in Basillia and I'm not sure it's over yet.

07:04.229 --> 07:05.731
Y - You see...

07:05.731 --> 07:08.666
Wait a minute, Orko, calm yourself first.

07:08.701 --> 07:10.170
The wind stopped as suddenly as they,
You're not listening to me.

07:10.170 --> 07:13.639
started and this incredible whirlwind
came out of nowhere...

07:13.639 --> 07:16.569
sucking in new subjects, like a magnet.
You have to listen to me.

07:17.309 --> 07:18.606
This doesn't help.

07:18.844 --> 07:20.846
D - Don't you understand...

07:20.846 --> 07:22.973
-It's gone...
-Please Orko, not right now.

07:23.215 --> 07:25.513
This is important.
Any sign of Skeletor?

07:26.018 --> 07:28.748
No, no sign of him.
That's one of the mysteries.

07:28.954 --> 07:32.412
The strangest mystery is my sword.
It's gone.

07:32.925 --> 07:34.153
Disappeared.

07:34.426 --> 07:36.587
Why won't anyone listen to me?

07:36.795 --> 07:39.628
All right, Orko.
What are you trying to tell us?

07:39.865 --> 07:41.992
Castle Grayskull.  It's gone!

07:42.200 --> 07:43.064
Gone?

07:43.268 --> 07:45.702
But a castle can't just up and disappear.

07:45.971 --> 07:47.268
Well, this one did.

07:47.439 --> 07:50.875
If what Orko says is true,
it might explain what happened.

07:51.143 --> 07:54.010
Come on. We better check into this.

07:55.814 --> 07:57.543
I've never seen anything like this.

07:57.749 --> 08:00.479
-I told ya! Look.
It's gone alright.

08:00.752 --> 08:03.346
At least it's not here in our dimension.

08:03.555 --> 08:06.786
Odd sort of way,
things are beginning to make sense.

08:08.327 --> 08:10.762
What's that, Duncan?
I think there's a connection...

08:10.762 --> 08:14.163
between your missing sword
and Grayskull's disappearance.

08:14.366 --> 08:17.767
The problems in Basilia
were probably just a side effect.

08:18.403 --> 08:19.927
This is incredible.

08:24.543 --> 08:28.536
This is very rare.
We are looking at a white hole.

08:28.780 --> 08:29.872
A what?

08:30.082 --> 08:33.107
A white hole. It's like a black
hole, only not as dense.

08:33.518 --> 08:36.248
And you think Skeletor's
involved in all of this?

08:36.455 --> 08:37.355
Absolutely.

08:37.389 --> 08:39.583
I suspect he utilized the Council

08:39.725 --> 08:43.256
of Evil.
After he located a dying neutron star...

08:43.294 --> 08:45.430
..and was able to direct it over the

08:45.430 --> 08:48.890
castle to use the tremendous
suction force from the nova,

08:49.134 --> 08:51.403
and pull the castle, with the Sorceress...

08:51.403 --> 08:53.564
into another dimension.

08:53.772 --> 08:55.137
Exactly.

08:55.440 --> 08:57.135
Where are they?

08:58.276 --> 08:59.641
Come on, Battle Cat.

08:59.845 --> 09:02.177
Maybe there's a clue on the other side.

09:05.250 --> 09:07.718
The Sorceress may still be able to help!

09:08.020 --> 09:09.885
Wait, I'm going too!

09:11.123 --> 09:14.422
Don't underestimate the
white hole's strength.

09:15.994 --> 09:17.696
Whatever Skeletor has planned...

09:17.696 --> 09:21.462
for the Sorceress and Castle
Grayskull will take place very soon.

09:21.667 --> 09:23.430
That I'm sure of.

09:23.635 --> 09:26.001
But how do I get there to bring them back?

09:26.938 --> 09:29.873
It feels as if I'm getting
some kind of signal.

09:31.710 --> 09:32.972
It's from the Sorceress.

09:35.714 --> 09:37.115
That's it, Battle Cat.

09:37.115 --> 09:39.709
We'll follow her signals into the vortex.

09:40.352 --> 09:42.217
He-Man?  Battle cat?

09:42.554 --> 09:45.751
Stand back, Teela,
we're going into the white hole.

09:56.802 --> 09:58.269
Help meee!

09:59.304 --> 10:01.295
I'm falling!

10:08.080 --> 10:09.945
Oh, h... how did it happen?

10:10.649 --> 10:13.518
He-Man and Battle Cat must
have set off a reaction...

10:13.518 --> 10:15.315
when they entered the hole.

10:15.554 --> 10:17.255
But, will they be alright?

10:17.255 --> 10:20.281
Let's hope so, Orko.
Let's really hope so.

10:32.104 --> 10:33.405
Where am I?

10:33.405 --> 10:35.134
How do I get out of here?

10:36.441 --> 10:39.103
-He-Man!
-Teela is close behind us,

10:39.211 --> 10:42.408
but she doesn't have the
Sorceress' vibes to follow.

10:42.614 --> 10:44.081
He-Man.

10:44.282 --> 10:46.273
Come on, she's over that way.

10:48.386 --> 10:51.913
If I just had a sense of direction
here, wherever I am...

11:08.507 --> 11:10.270
I've got you, Teela.

11:10.675 --> 11:11.767
He-Man.

11:12.878 --> 11:14.812
You couldn't believe...

11:15.080 --> 11:18.072
Well I, guess you could.

11:18.316 --> 11:19.785
-Thanks.
Save the thanks for...

11:19.785 --> 11:22.754
after we find the Sorceress
and Castle Grayskull.

11:22.954 --> 11:26.117
Now, where are you Sorceress?

11:28.693 --> 11:30.183
I've got her.

11:30.695 --> 11:33.425
Come on, her signal is stronger this way.

11:45.110 --> 11:48.536
We've get around these,
things, to that clearing.

11:55.787 --> 11:57.652
Help!  He-Man!

11:58.190 --> 11:59.452
Help!

12:03.695 --> 12:05.663
My stun ray's not working.

12:05.864 --> 12:07.743
I'm not surprised. I don't think

12:07.768 --> 12:09.881
any of our devices will work here.

12:12.504 --> 12:14.665
Easy, Battle Cat, easy.

12:30.555 --> 12:33.023
-We're in the clear. Keep moving.

12:42.767 --> 12:44.402
We've gotta go through that?!

12:44.402 --> 12:46.893
Yes, we're getting closer.

12:50.475 --> 12:52.739
Get a running start and you can make it.

13:08.193 --> 13:11.185
Stay with me.
We are almost there.

13:11.396 --> 13:13.489
Now where do we go?
-That way.

13:13.732 --> 13:15.597
We need to get over to that funnel.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.028
Lead the way!

13:27.512 --> 13:29.139
This is some place!

13:29.414 --> 13:31.439
Everything's the opposite of Eternia.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.911
The trees grow in.

13:34.886 --> 13:36.854
The waterfall runs up hill.

13:37.255 --> 13:38.688
Come on, Sorceress.

13:39.024 --> 13:40.787
Lead us to you.

13:40.992 --> 13:42.425
We're here, He-Man.

13:42.694 --> 13:45.185
Skeletor has transported
us to this dimension...

13:45.463 --> 13:47.954
where he hopes to learn
the castle's secrets.

13:48.233 --> 13:50.435
My powers are working in reverse here.

13:50.435 --> 13:53.404
So we're trapped, unless you can help.

13:53.605 --> 13:55.698
-Now!
-Come on! This way!

13:59.577 --> 14:01.010
Castle Grayskull.

14:01.246 --> 14:03.043
Just as the Sorceress said.

14:03.281 --> 14:06.444
Hurry, He-Man. Time is running out.

14:07.819 --> 14:10.515
Let's give Skeletor a big surprise.

14:10.755 --> 14:12.279
I'm for that.

14:20.598 --> 14:24.090
Skeletor must be holding the
Sorceress in her chambers.

14:26.972 --> 14:28.200
Skeletor!

14:28.340 --> 14:33.437
He-Man, you're a fool if you
think you can stop me here.

14:35.413 --> 14:40.146
Now we're playing in my dimension
and I make all the rules.

14:40.585 --> 14:43.019
Sorceress,
are you alright? -Yes...

14:43.254 --> 14:46.519
except for this uninvited guest.

14:48.693 --> 14:51.240
I've longed for this moment, because

14:51.265 --> 14:54.087
you're powerless against me now, He-Man.

14:54.432 --> 14:57.230
See if you stand up to my stun ray.

15:16.621 --> 15:18.612
Look closely, Skeletor.

15:18.823 --> 15:20.256
Look at my sword.

15:20.492 --> 15:22.093
Even in this evil dimension...

15:22.093 --> 15:25.927
it can draw power from the good
that lies in Castle Grayskull.

15:26.131 --> 15:28.199
You're a loser, Skeletor!

15:28.199 --> 15:30.258
You'll see who the loser is.

15:35.006 --> 15:37.372
This should stop you for a while.

15:43.882 --> 15:47.285
He-Man, I can use my
powers in reverse...

15:47.285 --> 15:49.549
to keep Skeletor at bay.

15:49.754 --> 15:52.917
Get Skeletor in front of the mirror.

16:01.099 --> 16:04.102
I may not have acquired
the castle's secrets...

16:04.102 --> 16:06.662
but once the white hole is gone...

16:06.771 --> 16:09.638
You, the castle and all
your friends here...

16:09.941 --> 16:12.375
Will never be able to return to Eternia.

16:12.977 --> 16:14.604
Take over, Sorceress.

16:14.846 --> 16:16.245
But first...

16:25.957 --> 16:27.720
What?  You can't...

16:32.697 --> 16:35.291
You're all fools if you
think you can stop me.

16:35.934 --> 16:38.664
How long do you think you can hold me?

16:39.504 --> 16:42.905
Hurry, He-Man,
I'm losing my strength.

16:44.709 --> 16:47.143
I'll make it as fast as I can, Sorceress.

16:47.345 --> 16:49.313
Just hold on a little longer.

16:56.221 --> 16:58.280
That should be the fulcrum point.

17:15.607 --> 17:17.006
Help me, Sorceress.

17:17.275 --> 17:19.641
Give me the strength of
the castle's secrets.

17:19.944 --> 17:22.344
I hear you and I am trying.

17:23.681 --> 17:27.013
He-Man, may you have all the powers.

17:27.318 --> 17:29.339
All the strength that dwell in the

17:29.364 --> 17:31.210
secrets of truth and knowledge.

17:34.225 --> 17:35.192
I...

17:35.426 --> 17:36.324
I...

17:36.461 --> 17:38.793
I can do it!

18:04.189 --> 18:05.247
Look!

18:35.753 --> 18:39.856
You won't get away with this for long.
I'll make you all pay.

18:39.857 --> 18:44.055
This was my chance.
The big chance I waited for.

18:44.262 --> 18:47.527
I will beat you yet, He-Man.

18:50.902 --> 18:53.671
Well, maybe we won't hear
from Skeletor for a while.

18:53.671 --> 18:54.933
I doubt it.

18:55.139 --> 18:57.436
He just won't be able to try anything

18:57.461 --> 18:59.395
this big for a long, long time.

19:02.180 --> 19:04.478
And with that, I'll say goodbye.

19:04.549 --> 19:06.983
Thank you, He-Man.
Thank you all.

19:08.853 --> 19:11.981
Well, this is a real special
day, don't ya think?

19:12.257 --> 19:14.953
Of course,
it already was a very special day for me.

19:15.026 --> 19:16.628
You know what I mean?

19:16.628 --> 19:19.688
I feel strongly about special days. I...

19:19.931 --> 19:23.201
always have. When ya think a
special day only comes...

19:23.201 --> 19:24.691
once a year...

19:25.336 --> 19:29.272
Oh, well, I'll see you guys later.
-He's really gonna be surprised.

19:30.875 --> 19:33.867
So what if they've all
forgotten it's my birthday?

19:34.078 --> 19:35.943
I can still have fun.

19:36.948 --> 19:39.910
Well, celebrating, alone isnt all that bad.

19:42.153 --> 19:44.644
Orko!  There you are.

19:44.989 --> 19:47.048
The king wants to see you right now.

19:47.959 --> 19:50.587
Now?  Oh, I - I can't.

19:50.862 --> 19:54.093
Of course, now.
King Randor has summoned you.

19:58.069 --> 20:00.333
Go ahead, Orko, go on in.

20:01.539 --> 20:02.740
Surprise!

20:02.740 --> 20:04.970
Happy birthday, Orko!
-Surpise!

20:05.376 --> 20:08.675
Well, look what else
we have for you, Orko.

20:09.814 --> 20:14.012
I baked all this especially for you.

20:14.052 --> 20:15.520
my friend, Orko!

20:19.021 --> 20:23.754
Oh no, I should have known my friends
wouldn't forget my birthday.

20:29.067 --> 20:31.895
Oh boy... this time I really over...

20:31.936 --> 20:33.678
did it!
I ate so much I didn't

20:33.703 --> 20:35.396
have any room left in my stomach for...

20:35.606 --> 20:38.632
dinner. In fact,
it maybe days before I'm hungry again!

20:38.776 --> 20:41.538
It really doesn't make sense to eat
too many sweets in between meals.

20:41.779 --> 20:43.770
A litle snack is fine, but don't overdo it.

20:44.015 --> 20:45.528
Because if you do, you won't have

20:45.553 --> 20:47.218
room left for the three healthy meals

20:47.218 --> 20:49.287
which you should have every day.

20:49.287 --> 20:51.687
Don't get carried away with sweets.

20:52.490 --> 20:54.685
Oh, I wish I hadn't.
