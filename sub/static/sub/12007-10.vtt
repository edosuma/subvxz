00:00.133 --> 00:01.533
Previously on Switched at Birth...

00:01.634 --> 00:03.700
- Juanita.
- I can't believe you have the nerve

00:03.735 --> 00:05.385
to show your face.

00:05.421 --> 00:07.588
- I know these people.
- And they don't like you.

00:07.640 --> 00:08.755
I can win them back.

00:08.807 --> 00:10.390
(Laughing)

00:10.426 --> 00:12.643
Does Julian know you have a boyfriend?

00:12.678 --> 00:13.760
I want you to move in with me.

00:13.812 --> 00:16.597
- I have feelings for someone else.
- What?

00:16.649 --> 00:19.516
I did the math. To get
above a "C" in the class...

00:19.568 --> 00:21.602
You'd have to ace everything else.

00:21.654 --> 00:24.354
Do you think I should drop the class?

00:24.356 --> 00:25.739
If the rest of the songs are that good,

00:25.774 --> 00:27.524
you've got a massive hit on your hands.

00:27.576 --> 00:30.410
How do you feel about this
having its world premiere

00:30.446 --> 00:31.695
at the Cracked Mug?

00:31.697 --> 00:34.531
Congratulations! You're making a movie.

00:34.583 --> 00:37.367
You and Emmett... that's the relationship

00:37.419 --> 00:38.869
you should be fighting for.

00:38.921 --> 00:40.704
Hey, dad, do you think that you
could find someone to fill in for me?

00:40.756 --> 00:42.539
You need to get back to that art project?

00:42.591 --> 00:45.375
No, I'm going to L.A.

00:47.546 --> 00:49.596
Okay, how do you say "ocean"?

00:51.550 --> 00:54.384
Okay, so water and then the waves.

00:54.470 --> 00:58.355
Nice. How do you say "kiss"?

01:12.621 --> 01:14.287
Cut!

01:19.411 --> 01:21.461
So this time, at the end,

01:21.497 --> 01:24.414
look into each other's eyes for a beat.

01:27.636 --> 01:29.553
Reset!

01:31.640 --> 01:33.306
Set.

01:37.513 --> 01:39.479
Surprise!

01:44.080 --> 01:45.266
_

01:45.487 --> 01:46.770
Take five, everyone.

01:48.574 --> 01:50.323
Wow!

01:50.359 --> 01:51.575
Look at this place. It's amazing.

01:51.576 --> 01:53.890
_

01:53.896 --> 01:56.613
Well, you posted where
you were on Instagram.

01:56.665 --> 01:58.498
This is okay, right?

01:58.499 --> 02:01.645
_

02:01.687 --> 02:04.287
I hated not talking.

02:04.289 --> 02:06.623
I needed to see you in person

02:06.675 --> 02:09.376
so we could just get over whatever it is

02:09.428 --> 02:11.294
that happened between us and move on.

02:11.295 --> 02:13.599
_

02:13.600 --> 02:20.171
_

02:20.522 --> 02:21.471
Totally get it.

02:21.523 --> 02:23.356
Just do your thing!

02:23.392 --> 02:25.609
Okay, how do you say "ocean"?

02:28.447 --> 02:30.530
Is that supposed to be me and you?

02:30.531 --> 02:35.324
_

02:35.925 --> 02:38.131
_

02:38.490 --> 02:40.490
Wow, that's cool.

02:42.377 --> 02:45.495
Hey, Em? We should really do it again

02:45.547 --> 02:46.797
if you want to finish everything up.

02:46.832 --> 02:48.715
Em?

02:49.716 --> 02:52.600
_

02:52.901 --> 02:55.807
_

02:55.808 --> 02:57.724
Hey, nice to meet you.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.509
You too.

03:03.010 --> 03:05.353
_

03:05.484 --> 03:08.685
Of course. I will just be

03:08.687 --> 03:12.355
sitting over there
watching you work from afar.

03:12.407 --> 03:14.491
Don't worry about me.

03:19.364 --> 03:21.698
Look at me. I'm in L.A.!

03:28.540 --> 03:30.507
<i>(Theme music playing)</i>

03:30.508 --> 03:34.100
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:36.381 --> 03:39.432
Ah, yes! Puts me in the lead.

03:39.468 --> 03:41.768
Are you sure you've never
played frisbee golf before?

03:41.804 --> 03:43.770
Oh, beginner's luck.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.689
Well, don't get too cocky.

03:45.724 --> 03:48.391
(Laughs) This is nice.

03:48.393 --> 03:52.312
The semester is done and
my chemistry test is over.

03:52.364 --> 03:54.781
For the first time in four months,

03:54.817 --> 03:58.568
I don't have to do
anything except have fun.

03:58.570 --> 04:01.738
So you mean I'm not on the clock here?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.573
(Phone beeping)

04:03.625 --> 04:05.575
- Oh, sweet.
- What?

04:05.577 --> 04:09.579
It's Vimla. She got an "A-" in chemistry.

04:09.581 --> 04:11.414
Wait, grades are out?

04:11.416 --> 04:13.416
Yeah, I guess so.

04:13.418 --> 04:15.418
An "A-"? She must be thrilled.

04:15.470 --> 04:17.470
Oh, here they are.

04:32.321 --> 04:35.272
I just don't understand how you got a "D."

04:35.324 --> 04:38.408
I mean, you brought your
midterm grade up to a "C."

04:39.578 --> 04:42.445
I must have bombed the final.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.499
There's no way I'm getting into med school

04:46.535 --> 04:48.752
with a "D" in chemistry.

04:48.787 --> 04:50.620
Probably not.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.625
Oh, god, Bay.

04:55.627 --> 04:58.428
Your sister?

04:58.463 --> 05:00.597
She did something for me

05:00.632 --> 05:02.515
so that I could be a doctor.

05:02.551 --> 05:04.684
Something big.

05:04.720 --> 05:08.471
I just can't believe that it
all boils down to one class.

05:08.523 --> 05:10.724
- So what are you going to do?
- What can I do?

05:10.776 --> 05:14.477
Just accept it and move on.

05:20.369 --> 05:23.486
Thanks again for everything.

05:23.488 --> 05:25.488
I'll see you around.

05:35.467 --> 05:37.467
We kiss pretty good for a couple

05:37.502 --> 05:39.386
that's never been on a real date before.

05:39.421 --> 05:41.504
Well, hey, are you ready for this?

05:41.506 --> 05:43.757
What exactly should I be ready for?

05:43.809 --> 05:47.560
I was thinking that we'd
organize the stock room

05:47.596 --> 05:49.596
and do some inventory.

05:49.648 --> 05:52.349
Okay, don't even joke with me.

05:52.401 --> 05:53.767
(Laughs)

05:59.524 --> 06:00.523
Oh.

06:00.525 --> 06:04.361
We're going horseback riding?

06:04.363 --> 06:06.413
Yes, Ma'am. You said when you were little,

06:06.448 --> 06:08.665
you wish you'd lived on a farm, so...

06:08.700 --> 06:10.533
(Both laughing)

06:10.535 --> 06:13.536
This is amazing. I love you.

06:18.510 --> 06:19.709
Sorry.

06:19.761 --> 06:23.630
Don't be. It's... it's nice to hear.

06:25.550 --> 06:26.683
Well, we should get going.

06:26.718 --> 06:28.385
Yeah.

06:30.522 --> 06:32.605
Of course, I'll call you right after.

06:32.641 --> 06:34.557
- Bye.
- Hey.

06:34.609 --> 06:37.560
Honey, that was Lydia.

06:37.612 --> 06:39.729
She pitched <i> Batter
Up</i> to this big producer.

06:39.781 --> 06:42.649
She has a bunch of obies and three
of her shows have gone to Broadway.

06:42.701 --> 06:45.368
- Uh- huh.
- Yeah, she loved the world

06:45.404 --> 06:47.320
and the fact that we're
a mother-and-son team,

06:47.372 --> 06:50.473
and she's flying out to see the showcase.

06:50.509 --> 06:52.375
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.327
Imagine if we got this thing funded.

06:54.379 --> 06:56.296
I think you're getting a
little ahead of yourself.

06:56.331 --> 06:58.665
I know, I know, I'm just... I'm so excited.

06:58.717 --> 07:00.583
(Laughs)

07:00.585 --> 07:02.419
Aren't you?

07:05.324 --> 07:07.257
Yeah, I am.

07:07.259 --> 07:10.393
This could be awesome. And, uh,

07:10.429 --> 07:12.429
it's exactly what I need right now.

07:18.603 --> 07:21.604
So is it always this nice out?

07:21.606 --> 07:23.440
Pretty much.

07:23.442 --> 07:24.657
How do you know what month it is?

07:24.693 --> 07:27.577
Well, we have calendars.

07:27.612 --> 07:30.280
- I was kidding.
- Right.

07:32.751 --> 07:34.751
I think this is so awesome,

07:34.786 --> 07:37.454
what you guys are doing.
I'm seriously impressed.

07:37.506 --> 07:40.757
Well, it's all Emmett.
He's killing it at school.

07:40.792 --> 07:44.461
He's the only freshman this
year to get his own short made.

07:44.463 --> 07:46.763
Yeah, he is pretty amazing.

07:46.798 --> 07:48.715
He doesn't let being deaf hold him back.

07:48.767 --> 07:51.301
I mean, it's challenging at first, but...

07:51.353 --> 07:52.556
But then everyone adjusts,

07:52.757 --> 07:54.810
and then it becomes really
not a big deal at all.

07:54.823 --> 07:56.639
Yeah.

07:56.741 --> 08:00.610
I think he's going to be working
here for a really long time.

08:02.481 --> 08:05.281
And I guess you'll be here too.

08:05.317 --> 08:07.317
Yep.

08:07.319 --> 08:11.571
Hey! You know what? I
have some stuff to do.

08:11.623 --> 08:14.707
Is it okay if I just meet you
back at your dorm room later?

08:16.378 --> 08:18.411
Oh. Right.

08:21.412 --> 08:23.312
_

08:23.468 --> 08:24.634
Me too.

08:24.669 --> 08:27.504
- Bye, Skye.
- See you later.

08:29.508 --> 08:31.724
(Texting)

08:33.508 --> 08:36.342
She's awesome.

08:36.342 --> 08:39.400
_

08:39.402 --> 08:40.890
_

08:41.566 --> 08:44.567
That's what Professor
Epstein loved about it.

08:44.568 --> 08:51.336
_

08:51.337 --> 08:54.821
_

08:57.222 --> 08:59.962
_

09:00.619 --> 09:03.670
I don't even think you can
change it at this point.

09:03.705 --> 09:06.589
Professor Epstein approved this script.

09:08.343 --> 09:11.678
Don't freak out. Just keep Bay

09:11.713 --> 09:14.430
away from set later today.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.861
You haven't said anything in 20 minutes.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.613
You okay?

09:33.665 --> 09:34.948
I... I'm fine.

09:38.670 --> 09:41.587
It's great. It's so beautiful.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.960
So I got a call yesterday.

09:47.012 --> 09:48.761
Somebody wants to buy the coffeehouse.

09:48.797 --> 09:52.682
Wait, what? Who?

09:52.717 --> 09:54.684
A guy who owns a few
places around the city,

09:54.719 --> 09:56.719
looking to expand to East Riverside.

09:56.721 --> 09:59.555
It's a good offer too... 200 grand, cash.

09:59.607 --> 10:02.642
You told him no, right?

10:02.694 --> 10:05.028
Actually, I'm thinking about it.

10:05.063 --> 10:07.563
Are you serious?

10:07.615 --> 10:10.900
We can't just jump ship. We put so much in.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.952
It's an opportunity that could
be lucrative for both of us.

10:12.988 --> 10:17.707
So that whole "everyone should
have their own mug" thing?

10:17.742 --> 10:19.826
"I want a place where
everyone feels at home"?

10:19.878 --> 10:22.745
Yeah, I meant that. And I'm
proud of what we've made.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.014
But I gotta be practical.

10:26.885 --> 10:28.751
Look, just think about it.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.671
We don't have to give him an
answer until the end of this week.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.641
(Clicks tongue)

10:37.812 --> 10:40.596
Hey, I got a surprise for you.

10:42.597 --> 10:44.286
_

10:50.108 --> 10:52.608
Is it the right color?

10:52.660 --> 10:53.943
I wasn't sure if it mattered.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.965
_

10:56.114 --> 10:58.114
Um, I was looking at apartments,

10:58.116 --> 11:02.001
and I thought, Emmett needs
a chair with his name on it.

11:02.002 --> 11:04.432
_

11:04.656 --> 11:07.790
Yeah, if you're gonna be
here, then I'm gonna be here.

11:08.191 --> 11:09.115
_

11:10.962 --> 11:14.764
We've been planning this for months.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.933
And we hit a bump,

11:16.968 --> 11:20.720
or two. But no more bumps.

11:21.721 --> 11:22.904
_

11:23.641 --> 11:25.058
Are you all right?

11:25.659 --> 11:31.717
_

11:31.950 --> 11:34.033
Oh, can I help? I could
test you or something.

11:34.034 --> 11:35.999
_

11:37.989 --> 11:40.990
Well, I could be your assistant.

11:41.042 --> 11:44.827
Can I get you anything else, Mr. Director?

11:46.828 --> 11:49.943
_

11:59.444 --> 12:00.644
_

12:00.645 --> 12:06.855
_

12:07.068 --> 12:08.768
Not for me.

12:09.069 --> 12:10.832
_

12:11.333 --> 12:14.633
_

12:15.076 --> 12:17.777
Oh. Totally.

12:17.829 --> 12:20.830
Um, okay.

12:20.865 --> 12:24.700
Yeah, I'll just... I'll go to the getty,

12:24.736 --> 12:26.702
or the tar pits,

12:26.754 --> 12:31.040
or one of the many other
amazing Los Angeles sights

12:31.092 --> 12:33.759
that are listed in my trusty guidebook.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.394
_

12:35.395 --> 12:36.820
_

12:39.050 --> 12:42.018
(Crying)

12:52.063 --> 12:54.814
Permission to come aboard?

12:54.866 --> 12:57.700
S... sure.

13:07.629 --> 13:09.579
Did something happen?

13:09.631 --> 13:12.665
We got an offer to buy the Cracked Mug.

13:12.717 --> 13:15.718
Oh, hey, that's great, right?

13:19.007 --> 13:21.674
But you don't want to sell.

13:21.726 --> 13:24.894
I mean, if he is so quick

13:24.929 --> 13:29.899
to bail on something that we just
spent months building together,

13:29.934 --> 13:33.853
how do I know that he is not
just going to up and bail on me?

13:35.740 --> 13:40.860
At first I thought it was because
I was trying to get over Angelo,

13:40.912 --> 13:43.746
dive into something new.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.752
But it's not. It's real.

13:49.787 --> 13:51.671
Sounds like you're in love.

13:52.857 --> 13:54.624
Yeah.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.881
And I actually told him that
for the first time today.

14:03.902 --> 14:06.552
And he didn't say it back.

14:09.073 --> 14:10.840
Yikes.

14:11.859 --> 14:14.977
Look, those are big
words for a guy, you know.

14:16.848 --> 14:18.881
But it's not a good sign, right?

14:18.917 --> 14:22.702
I hate to say it, but no.

14:22.737 --> 14:25.821
Probably not.

14:25.857 --> 14:27.707
Right.

14:31.708 --> 14:36.911
_

14:36.912 --> 14:39.357
_

14:39.758 --> 14:41.952
_

14:41.953 --> 14:43.420
_

14:43.421 --> 14:45.555
_

14:45.856 --> 14:47.097
_

14:48.598 --> 14:51.866
_

14:52.567 --> 14:55.774
_

14:55.937 --> 14:57.920
(Phone vibrating)

14:58.721 --> 15:03.958
_

15:04.259 --> 15:05.322
_

15:05.323 --> 15:09.235
_

15:09.636 --> 15:10.830
_

15:10.831 --> 15:17.058
_

15:17.159 --> 15:18.730
_

15:18.731 --> 15:21.675
_

15:21.976 --> 15:23.145
_

15:26.684 --> 15:28.551
(Knock at door)

15:29.687 --> 15:30.853
Hi.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.938
Hey.

15:37.812 --> 15:39.612
Wow, you seem happy.

15:39.647 --> 15:43.032
I am. I've decided that
guy has got nothing on me.

15:43.067 --> 15:47.987
Guess who's got a Broadway producer
coming to listen to his music tonight?

15:48.039 --> 15:50.956
- You do?
- Yep, this guy.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.626
I'm really excited for you.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.913
- But I don't think I should come.
- Why not?

15:57.915 --> 16:00.633
- I want you there.
- I just don't want to distract you.

16:00.668 --> 16:04.587
You need to focus, and I think I just
need some time to figure this out.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.590
Hey, I may not wear tweed jackets every day

16:07.642 --> 16:11.594
and have nine degrees like
deaf Colin Firth or whatever,

16:11.596 --> 16:14.680
- but I got stuff going on.
- I know.

16:14.732 --> 16:18.017
- I just still feel a bit...
- confused, I know.

16:18.069 --> 16:21.937
But that's why I'm here, to unconfuse you.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.940
Honestly, the whole
thing just snuck up on me.

16:24.942 --> 16:28.828
I swear, it wasn't even something I fully
realized until Kathryn said something.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.780
Wait, what?

16:30.782 --> 16:32.948
- Your mom, she...
- My mom?

16:32.950 --> 16:35.034
Oh god, I assumed she told you.

16:35.086 --> 16:37.620
Told me what?

16:37.672 --> 16:39.755
Well, that she saw me on campus with him

16:39.791 --> 16:42.875
and sensed something... I don't
know... and asked me what was going on.

16:42.927 --> 16:45.628
My mom talked to you about us?

16:45.663 --> 16:48.931
- She said that I owed it to you to...
- Stop.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.800
Please.

16:56.142 --> 16:57.528
Eric: You think 40 is enough?

16:58.320 --> 17:00.770
Yeah, should be.

17:03.108 --> 17:07.777
Look, um, I know you're
upset about the offer.

17:07.829 --> 17:10.195
And about what you said.

17:10.198 --> 17:14.200
When I said, "I love you," and
you looked at me like I was crazy.

17:14.202 --> 17:18.038
- You're not crazy.
- This isn't easy for me either.

17:19.925 --> 17:22.842
I know it's hard to move on.

17:22.877 --> 17:25.762
But I felt like we were
getting closer and...

17:25.797 --> 17:28.131
Regina, I care about you.

17:28.183 --> 17:31.885
But Will comes first.
If we sell this place,

17:31.887 --> 17:34.971
that money is for college. I
have to think about our future.

17:35.023 --> 17:37.891
I wanted to be part of that future.

17:39.945 --> 17:41.194
It's complicated.

17:43.281 --> 17:46.950
Then you're right. We
should sell the place.

17:49.071 --> 17:51.955
Okay, and these are the
Silverlake apartments?

17:51.990 --> 17:56.159
Sounds good. I just need to grab a pen,

17:56.211 --> 17:58.828
one second.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.965
Uh, hmm...

18:02.000 --> 18:04.217
Bingo.

18:07.350 --> 18:10.181
_

18:10.626 --> 18:12.092
Double bingo.

18:12.144 --> 18:16.012
(Chattering, music playing)

18:18.450 --> 18:21.184
- Mom?
- Oh, there you are. Thank god you're here.

18:21.236 --> 18:24.988
Did you talk to my girlfriend
about me and that other guy?

18:25.023 --> 18:28.208
I just thought that if she was
having conflicting feelings,

18:28.243 --> 18:30.193
she owed it to you to tell you the truth.

18:30.245 --> 18:32.779
- Why didn't you talk to me about it?
- Okay, I should have.

18:32.781 --> 18:35.999
It's just after Nikki, I can't bear
to see you get your heart broken again.

18:36.034 --> 18:39.919
Mom, I am a grown-up. I don't need
you to protect me from my girlfriend.

18:39.955 --> 18:41.921
Okay, okay.

18:41.957 --> 18:44.207
I'm sorry. I am. I'm sorry.

18:44.259 --> 18:47.127
You've made this 100 times
worse. You realize that?

18:47.129 --> 18:50.013
I didn't make Lily have
feelings for someone else.

18:50.048 --> 18:52.015
You pushed her into talking about it

18:52.050 --> 18:54.851
and thinking this is some huge deal.

18:54.886 --> 18:56.102
Maybe it would've just blown over.

18:56.138 --> 18:58.271
I think you're being a little unfair, Toby.

18:58.306 --> 19:02.776
I'm not really interested in
singing about baseball right now.

19:02.811 --> 19:04.728
Wait, wait, you're leaving?

19:04.780 --> 19:06.446
Hold on.

19:06.481 --> 19:10.033
If you want to be treated like a grown-up,
then you have to act like a grown-up.

19:10.068 --> 19:13.787
Even if you're mad at me, you
are the composer of a musical

19:13.822 --> 19:16.039
that is going on in three minutes.

19:16.074 --> 19:18.792
Think about the woman that flew
across the country to hear us.

19:18.827 --> 19:20.827
Think about all these people
who came here to see a show.

19:20.829 --> 19:22.996
You can't just walk out.

19:23.048 --> 19:25.048
Guys, guys, she's here.

19:25.083 --> 19:27.050
You ready?

19:36.201 --> 19:40.225
_

19:40.249 --> 19:43.016
No, it wasn't like that.
I'm trying to explain.

19:43.017 --> 19:46.704
_

19:48.857 --> 19:51.024
I need to talk to you now.

19:53.195 --> 19:56.079
Uh, cut, cut. Take five, everyone.

19:56.114 --> 19:58.198
You wrote about me and Tank?

19:59.899 --> 20:05.208
_

20:05.957 --> 20:09.092
You had no right to put this
in front of all of these people

20:09.127 --> 20:11.044
without asking my permission.

20:11.445 --> 20:14.105
_

20:14.266 --> 20:16.800
This is my life that you're drawing from.

20:16.801 --> 20:23.885
_

20:24.160 --> 20:27.811
You have had all this time to think,

20:27.863 --> 20:31.114
and you still feel like
I cheated on you? Really?

20:31.149 --> 20:33.867
- Um, hey, guys?
- Okay, back off!

20:33.902 --> 20:36.236
I'm talking to my boyfriend here.

20:36.238 --> 20:38.238
Okay.

20:45.330 --> 20:48.998
You still think that I
cheated on you with Tank?

20:49.050 --> 20:51.084
That's what you think?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.834
_

20:59.895 --> 21:01.094
(Stammers)

21:09.905 --> 21:12.105
Toby, that's the producer in the front row.

21:12.107 --> 21:14.107
You ready?

21:16.111 --> 21:18.778
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming out tonight.

21:18.830 --> 21:20.997
We are so excited to have you here.

21:21.032 --> 21:24.884
And without further ado,
<i>Batter Up: The Musical.</i>

23:05.937 --> 23:08.021
Hey, you came!

23:08.056 --> 23:10.773
Please tell me you
brought something to torch.

23:10.809 --> 23:12.775
- Nope.
- Oh, come on.

23:12.811 --> 23:15.144
There's a little pyro
in everyone. It's fun.

23:15.196 --> 23:18.064
I got somewhere to be for my family.

23:18.066 --> 23:20.033
- I'm late.
- You sure?

23:20.068 --> 23:23.903
- Yeah, but have a good time.
- Yeah, I'll do my best.

23:30.879 --> 23:33.796
"Once more into the breach, dear friends!"

23:33.832 --> 23:35.798
- "Once more!"
- (All cheering)

23:35.834 --> 23:38.968
Mingo, did you hear? There
was an accident off-campus,

23:39.004 --> 23:40.059
in front of the pizza place.

23:40.060 --> 23:43.096
A couple of deaf kids got
mowed down by a drunk driver.

23:43.174 --> 23:44.807
What?

23:49.931 --> 23:53.099
Daphne? Some kids from your
hall just got hit by a car

23:53.151 --> 23:55.952
in front of Barone's.
Did you hear anything?

23:56.004 --> 23:58.171
- What? I gotta go.
- I'll drive you.

23:59.908 --> 24:01.119
(Music playing)

24:02.308 --> 24:05.175
Will? You okay?

24:05.177 --> 24:06.476
I can't find my gusto.

24:08.514 --> 24:10.230
Mmm, let me see.

24:10.266 --> 24:12.182
Little blue guy about this big?

24:12.234 --> 24:15.018
Cloud wrangler in the thunderclap kingdom?

24:15.070 --> 24:17.104
You know him?

24:17.156 --> 24:18.522
Regina: You told me
about him once or twice.

24:32.254 --> 24:34.421
Hi, I'm Kathryn.

24:34.456 --> 24:36.340
- Hi, Kathryn.
- Hi.

24:36.375 --> 24:38.508
Thank you so much for coming all this way.

24:38.544 --> 24:41.128
Oh, it was just a few blocks.

24:41.180 --> 24:45.215
I am not even a baseball person,
but the songs were so moving.

24:45.284 --> 24:48.218
Thank you. Toby and I are so excited

24:48.270 --> 24:50.387
at the prospect of working with you.

24:50.389 --> 24:54.057
Working with me? Do you need my services?

24:56.128 --> 25:00.230
Uh, I'm sorry. Maybe I'm confused.

25:00.266 --> 25:03.317
I work for the Jackson
county appraisers' office.

25:05.304 --> 25:07.454
Oh, I apologize.

25:07.489 --> 25:10.157
I thought you were someone else.

25:10.209 --> 25:12.242
But thank you so much
for coming, thank you.

25:12.244 --> 25:15.379
- It was just terrific. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

25:15.414 --> 25:17.497
(Phone buzzing)

25:25.391 --> 25:28.058
Toby: So what did she think?

25:29.428 --> 25:31.395
She loved it.

25:31.430 --> 25:34.348
- That's great.
- But she's not the producer.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.100
- What?
- My editor just texted.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.102
Apparently the producer
thought it was flimsy

25:39.104 --> 25:41.238
and she doesn't see how
it could make a musical,

25:41.273 --> 25:45.275
- so she passes.
- Mom.

25:45.327 --> 25:49.196
This whole thing was just silly.
I don't know what I was thinking.

25:49.248 --> 25:51.164
Your book is not silly.

25:51.200 --> 25:54.117
And this is a musical.

25:54.169 --> 25:56.286
She's wrong.

25:56.288 --> 26:00.257
And so is Lily if she doesn't pick you.

26:00.292 --> 26:04.094
No, actually, two failed
relationships in a row,

26:04.129 --> 26:07.264
I think it's pretty clear there
is something wrong with me.

26:07.299 --> 26:10.217
That's not true. I like Lily.

26:10.269 --> 26:13.353
She's just... she's going
through something, honey.

26:17.276 --> 26:20.143
Look at us... a couple of winners.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.483
Eh, it's okay.

26:26.535 --> 26:29.186
(Sighs) You know what they say?

26:29.221 --> 26:33.156
- It ain't over...
- Both: Till it's over.

26:33.208 --> 26:36.076
- (Both laughing)
- That is what they say.

26:42.177 --> 26:45.497
_

26:45.498 --> 26:46.548
_

26:48.149 --> 26:54.271
_

26:54.272 --> 26:56.083
_

26:56.384 --> 27:00.305
_

27:00.306 --> 27:03.171
_

27:06.172 --> 27:07.572
_

27:15.417 --> 27:19.369
(Machine beeping)

27:29.070 --> 27:32.625
_

27:32.626 --> 27:34.479
_

27:34.480 --> 27:38.130
_

27:39.331 --> 27:42.939
_

27:44.109 --> 27:46.944
Who are you? Who are you?

27:46.946 --> 27:49.329
- I'm her friend.
- If you're not family, you can't be back here.

27:49.365 --> 27:51.949
Why haven't you told her what's going on?

27:52.001 --> 27:53.951
She's completely confused.

27:54.003 --> 27:56.086
She's deaf. She needs an interpreter.

27:56.121 --> 27:58.956
Can you do it?

27:59.008 --> 28:01.124
Yes.

28:01.176 --> 28:04.878
Tell her she has a possible
fractured pelvis and she needs an MRI.

28:04.879 --> 28:11.796
_

28:14.107 --> 28:15.901
_

28:16.702 --> 28:18.140
_

28:18.141 --> 28:23.048
_

28:23.249 --> 28:25.140
_

28:26.151 --> 28:28.318
Her back hurts. She's a
seven on the pain scale.

28:28.320 --> 28:30.203
Okay. Tell her I'll give her a painkiller.

28:33.004 --> 28:39.145
_

28:39.146 --> 28:42.689
_

28:43.135 --> 28:44.968
She's allergic to Dilaudid.

28:46.388 --> 28:48.171
Good to know.

28:52.144 --> 28:54.311
What's going on? Why isn't
there an interpreter here?

28:54.346 --> 28:57.097
- We're working on it.
- Excuse me.

28:57.149 --> 28:59.016
You need to face me, please.

28:59.018 --> 29:02.052
We don't have a contract with an
interpreter service on the weekends.

29:02.087 --> 29:06.023
So deaf people shouldn't
get hurt on the weekends?

29:06.075 --> 29:08.025
It's not my policy.

29:08.077 --> 29:10.911
What about a video phone? You're
supposed to have one of those.

29:10.946 --> 29:13.947
We do. We're trying to track it down.

29:13.999 --> 29:17.034
So you just left her completely
in the dark about what's going on?

29:17.036 --> 29:18.368
We're doing the best that we can.

29:18.370 --> 29:20.287
Well, obviously it's not good enough.

29:20.339 --> 29:22.873
I mean, what if you had given her Dilaudid?

29:22.925 --> 29:25.959
- Look, this doesn't happen very often.
- It's happening now.

29:26.011 --> 29:29.346
There are no doctors or nurses
here that know sign language.

29:29.381 --> 29:31.014
All right?

29:32.384 --> 29:33.934
Well, there should be.

29:45.172 --> 29:47.106
You're still here.

29:49.043 --> 29:50.876
Of course.

29:50.878 --> 29:53.178
Are they okay?

30:26.279 --> 30:30.654
_

30:31.955 --> 30:35.441
_

30:35.673 --> 30:38.891
I'm still trying to process

30:38.926 --> 30:41.894
what happened with Tank,

30:41.929 --> 30:44.847
and I know that's hard on you too,

30:44.899 --> 30:46.815
but we're going to get through this.

30:46.816 --> 30:49.760
_

30:51.261 --> 30:54.618
_

30:56.219 --> 30:59.622
_

31:00.648 --> 31:01.781
What's happening here?

31:03.868 --> 31:07.820
Emmett, I flew all the way out here

31:07.872 --> 31:09.655
to make it work.

31:09.656 --> 31:12.850
_

31:13.151 --> 31:17.301
_

31:20.201 --> 31:23.469
You have been begging me

31:23.504 --> 31:25.888
for months to come out here and now I can.

31:25.889 --> 31:28.044
_

31:28.059 --> 31:30.676
What are you saying? That
we've lost our window?

31:30.677 --> 31:31.677
_

31:32.278 --> 31:34.745
_

31:34.822 --> 31:36.689
You just want to blame Daphne

31:36.691 --> 31:38.691
for... for everything.

31:38.743 --> 31:41.327
And you know what? I'm tired of it.

31:41.362 --> 31:43.529
If you don't want me to move out here,

31:43.531 --> 31:44.580
then you need to say it.

31:51.301 --> 31:53.998
_

31:57.599 --> 32:05.255
_

32:05.553 --> 32:07.603
I'll get a job. I'll make friends.

32:07.604 --> 32:12.014
_

32:12.015 --> 32:15.840
_

32:15.841 --> 32:20.151
_

32:20.151 --> 32:21.567
And I'm gonna stop you?

32:21.568 --> 32:24.523
_

32:24.723 --> 32:27.361
It's because of that girl,
isn't it? It's because of Skye.

32:27.362 --> 32:28.362
_

32:29.110 --> 32:31.627
I waited for you to come back to me

32:31.662 --> 32:34.413
to talk through what
had happened with Tank,

32:34.415 --> 32:36.415
and... and I give you space.

32:36.417 --> 32:38.751
And then you just... you
disconnected without telling me.

32:38.753 --> 32:39.752
You moved on!

32:39.753 --> 32:43.659
_

32:44.259 --> 32:47.393
What happened to "I'll
always come find you"?

32:47.428 --> 32:50.763
What happened to every single
thing that you have ever said to me?

32:50.764 --> 32:53.510
_

32:53.518 --> 32:56.268
No! No, you can't mean them

32:56.320 --> 32:57.520
and then not mean them.

32:59.021 --> 33:00.847
_

33:02.848 --> 33:08.968
_

33:14.569 --> 33:17.310
_

33:17.311 --> 33:21.892
_

33:22.597 --> 33:23.629
No.

33:25.466 --> 33:27.349
No, you get this straight.

33:28.436 --> 33:29.769
You do this now...

33:31.773 --> 33:33.439
It's done.

33:33.474 --> 33:34.640
It's forever.

34:10.011 --> 34:13.429
I guess you're going to have
to redo the end of our timeline.

34:35.914 --> 34:39.516
You know, I'm actually
kind of jealous of you.

34:40.585 --> 34:42.851
You know what you want
to do and you're doing it,

34:42.888 --> 34:44.838
and you're really good at it.

34:49.761 --> 34:52.812
I failed my chemistry class.

34:52.848 --> 34:54.797
Like, failed failed?

34:56.768 --> 34:58.685
Well, technically, I got a "D,"

34:58.737 --> 35:01.738
but you can't go to med school
with a "D" in chem. I won't get in.

35:01.773 --> 35:03.807
So...

35:03.842 --> 35:07.694
That whole "me being a
doctor" thing... not happening.

35:07.746 --> 35:10.447
Well, hold on. I don't know about that.

35:10.499 --> 35:13.867
I want to be this, like,

35:13.919 --> 35:17.487
shining star for my community.

35:17.522 --> 35:19.923
Make everyone proud.

35:19.958 --> 35:23.843
But I can't tell if I
failed because of me...

35:25.764 --> 35:28.465
Or my deafness, or what.

35:32.637 --> 35:34.804
Did you know that there's deaf singers?

35:34.806 --> 35:36.973
Like, really good ones.

35:37.008 --> 35:39.876
You can't sing if you're deaf.

35:39.911 --> 35:41.728
It's like the one thing you can't do.

35:41.780 --> 35:43.730
Wrong.

35:43.782 --> 35:46.816
My mom sent me this article
about a girl who was 18.

35:46.852 --> 35:48.785
She was in a music school
and she lost her hearing.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.887
She cried about it for, like, a year,

35:50.922 --> 35:52.822
and then she realized that her brain

35:52.874 --> 35:55.692
and her vocal chords
still remembered the notes.

35:55.710 --> 35:59.596
She finds the tempo by, like,
feeling the vibrations in the floor.

35:59.631 --> 36:02.665
She works through it, or whatever.

36:04.669 --> 36:07.754
Your mom randomly sent you
an article about a deaf girl?

36:07.806 --> 36:10.890
Uh, she knows that...

36:10.926 --> 36:12.809
You talked to your mom about me?

36:12.844 --> 36:15.545
- It came up.
- Aw.

36:15.580 --> 36:18.948
Look, the p... the point... the point is

36:18.984 --> 36:21.951
that you can take that
chemistry class again.

36:21.987 --> 36:23.820
You know that, right?

36:23.855 --> 36:26.606
It wouldn't matter. I'd
still have a "D" on my record.

36:26.658 --> 36:28.525
So what?

36:28.560 --> 36:31.694
If I were a med school, and everybody
who took that class got an "A,"

36:31.730 --> 36:33.863
and then I saw one girl
who retook that class

36:33.865 --> 36:36.699
and took it and took it until
she kicked that class's ass,

36:36.701 --> 36:39.502
I'd want that girl to go to my school.

36:39.538 --> 36:40.703
That girl has character.

36:40.739 --> 36:42.739
That class was hell.

36:42.774 --> 36:44.757
I'd be insane to take it again.

36:44.793 --> 36:48.878
Correction... it would be
very hard to take it again.

36:48.930 --> 36:51.614
It would be very
frustrating to take it again.

36:51.650 --> 36:54.601
But if you really want to be a doctor,

36:54.636 --> 36:56.803
you're going to take that class again.

36:59.591 --> 37:00.857
Oh my god.

37:00.892 --> 37:02.892
What?

37:05.780 --> 37:07.764
I'm taking that class again.

Yes, we do. I'm buying you out.

38:03.622 --> 38:04.754
What?

38:04.789 --> 38:08.458
I can put my old design
studio, K&D, up for sale.

38:08.510 --> 38:10.510
I've wanted to do that for a while now.

38:10.545 --> 38:12.879
And I still have some leftover
from my husband's life insurance.

38:12.931 --> 38:16.466
- Now hold up.
- I will pay you what you would have made on the sale.

38:16.501 --> 38:18.701

Any of it.

38:25.844 --> 38:27.560
What about Will?

38:27.612 --> 38:30.580
I've been spending so much energy
worrying about what he needs...

38:31.716 --> 38:33.900
but what he needs most is you.

38:36.955 --> 38:38.788
What I need is you.

38:40.542 --> 38:42.525
Don't play with my heart,

He was probably just protecting the money.

39:19.831 --> 39:22.865

39:52.630 --> 39:55.565
She's still alive.

40:53.792 --> 40:57.627
the fact that you took the blame
