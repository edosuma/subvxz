00:32.960 --> 00:33.960
I found him.

00:34.640 --> 00:37.600
He's a Professor of Neurogenetics
at the University of London.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.960
We need to get to London.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.480
What's in London?

01:11.360 --> 01:12.920
Him.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.400
Stop the car.

03:23.760 --> 03:24.880
There.

04:01.560 --> 04:02.560
There are too many.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
Are you sick?

12:29.880 --> 12:31.360
I have a headache.

12:31.640 --> 12:32.640
So take the pills.

12:33.560 --> 12:34.560
I'm going to.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.240
Show me. Show me the pills.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.320
What?

12:37.760 --> 12:38.760
You think I'm taking drugs again?

12:39.440 --> 12:42.880
I know you're upset about Theo.
I know how hard that must be for you.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.320
You were doing so well...

12:44.400 --> 12:45.680
I'm pregnant.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.480
Shit.

12:50.000 --> 12:52.280
You're supposed to say congratulations.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.880
Is it Nathan's?

13:09.520 --> 13:11.160
You think I was sleeping with
all the soldiers?

13:11.240 --> 13:12.240
No.

13:20.280 --> 13:21.280
He doesn't know.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.880
I'm not going to keep it.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.680
These are to terminate the pregnancy.

13:31.880 --> 13:33.520
Is that what you want?

13:35.040 --> 13:36.200
I don't know.

13:40.480 --> 13:42.520
I don't know if I can bring a baby...

13:44.160 --> 13:45.440
...into this world.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.880
Not after what happened to Theo.

13:50.880 --> 13:52.280
And to that little girl.

13:58.200 --> 14:00.000
Maybe it's for the best.

14:09.080 --> 14:10.480
I'm sorry.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.200
The stars are so much clearer now.

14:29.240 --> 14:31.240
The galaxies are moving away from us.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.680
They're moving faster and faster.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.560
Eventually they'll reach
the speed of light.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.240
When that happens,
one by one the stars will disappear.

14:41.560 --> 14:43.440
It will be total darkness.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.280
Is that supposed to cheer me up?

14:48.280 --> 14:49.320
Sorry.

14:51.520 --> 14:53.680
How long do we have until it happens?

14:54.920 --> 14:56.120
Millions of years.

14:56.720 --> 14:57.960
That soon?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.160
The man who came to the observatory...

15:10.520 --> 15:12.560
Why did he believe
he could change things?

15:15.720 --> 15:18.880
Surely it's too late?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.080
Perhaps they don't think like that.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.440
What do you mean?

15:26.720 --> 15:29.440
Their understanding of physics
is way beyond ours.

15:30.520 --> 15:33.600
I think they can conceive of a world

15:34.720 --> 15:37.560
where many different realities exist
at the same time.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.680
I struggle to imagine a life different
to the one I have lived.

15:42.680 --> 15:44.080
You have no regrets?

15:46.160 --> 15:48.800
Things you'd change if you could?

15:52.960 --> 15:58.000
Perhaps I would have seen
a little more of the world.

16:00.400 --> 16:05.160
My wife, my children -
they were everything to me.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.160
And you?

16:09.240 --> 16:10.440
I don't know.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.840
Maybe I would try and spend more time
with the people in my life.

16:16.200 --> 16:18.960
But then you might not
have the knowledge

16:19.040 --> 16:22.800
you need to change anything.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.720
That's true.

16:27.880 --> 16:29.480
Perhaps it's not so simple for you.

16:31.960 --> 16:32.960
Cheers.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.200
-It's beautiful.
-Yes.

28:21.280 --> 28:25.400
When I see this, it makes me glad
you stopped me taking my own life.

28:31.400 --> 28:34.120
I spent too much time
looking at the stars.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.240
I didn't see things
that were right in front of me.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.520
We are all guilty of that.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.560
I wish I'd told my wife that I loved her
more often.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.800
I should have told my children
that I was proud of them.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.720
The animals need feeding.
The cows needed milking.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.400
There was always something else to do.

28:59.760 --> 29:00.800
Always.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.120
Did you take the pill?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.320
Not yet.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.840
What?

29:34.000 --> 29:36.520
What are you doing?
You're styling my hair now?

29:37.720 --> 29:40.120
I remember when they brought you home
from the hospital.

29:40.920 --> 29:42.440
You remember that?

29:43.160 --> 29:44.760
Of course.

29:46.120 --> 29:48.080
You were so small.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.520
So beautiful.

29:52.640 --> 29:54.840
I was desperate to hold you...

29:59.320 --> 30:01.440
You should keep the baby.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.520
You said I should get rid of it?

30:05.880 --> 30:07.120
What do I know?

30:08.760 --> 30:14.440
I know about stars, and equations.

30:18.960 --> 30:20.320
What if I can't keep them safe?

30:21.200 --> 30:22.720
We'll go to London.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.000
I'll work out how to change things.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.040
I'll do it for you and your baby.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.720
You don't even know if you can...

30:30.800 --> 30:31.880
I can try.

30:34.160 --> 30:36.080
I want another chance.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.280
What do you mean?

30:39.800 --> 30:41.720
I was a rubbish big sister to you.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.280
Not completely.

30:46.400 --> 30:50.760
I'll try and be a much better aunt.

30:52.880 --> 30:55.760
You should keep the baby.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.280
I want to but...

31:09.000 --> 31:10.480
I'm scared.

31:10.880 --> 31:15.240
I need a reason for doing this.

31:16.880 --> 31:21.160
We'll make a better future for you,
for you and your baby.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.360
Don't make a decision you might regret.

31:37.600 --> 31:38.600
Okay.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.360
You're going to keep it?

31:46.440 --> 31:47.440
Yes.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.440
You're going to be a great mum...

31:52.920 --> 31:54.800
This kid better not take after me.

31:55.280 --> 31:57.440
I hope it's just like you.

31:58.240 --> 31:59.240
What's going on?

32:06.520 --> 32:07.520
What?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.480
I'm pregnant.

32:22.560 --> 32:23.560
How?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.560
You need me to draw you a diagram?

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
I love you.

32:36.960 --> 32:37.960
I love you too.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.400
Ash is dead. Someone stabbed him.

34:30.080 --> 34:31.600
We'll be in Calais around midday.

34:36.640 --> 34:37.640
You think it's safe?

39:37.080 --> 39:40.280
Sorry. I don't think we'll be able to
go much further.

40:01.080 --> 40:02.440
Over there, to the right.

40:04.960 --> 40:05.960
Yes.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.800
I really need to fart.

40:46.480 --> 40:47.520
Fast!

40:47.600 --> 40:48.600
Get out! Is everyone okay?

40:49.040 --> 40:50.440
I didn't see where the shots came from.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.320
Quick!

40:54.920 --> 40:55.920
Come on, faster!

41:10.160 --> 41:11.160
They're on top of the containers.

42:00.520 --> 42:01.520
Wait!

42:24.760 --> 42:26.200
Inside! Go!

42:38.640 --> 42:40.000
We can't stay here!

42:40.920 --> 42:42.560
I'll slow you down. You go.

42:42.640 --> 42:44.280
We're not leaving you.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.600
You cannot change anything
if you are dead.

42:56.520 --> 42:57.520
For the baby.

42:57.600 --> 43:01.000
I know you don't believe.
It's all I have.

43:05.880 --> 43:07.200
-Thank you.
-Help me.

43:16.920 --> 43:19.720
Here. Pull the pin
and release the handle.

43:21.400 --> 43:22.880
-Just like in the movies.
-Like the movies.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.160
Catherine.

43:29.240 --> 43:33.240
Have faith. In whatever you do. Okay?
