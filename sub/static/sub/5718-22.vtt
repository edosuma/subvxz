WEBVTT

00:04.238 --> 00:07.175
Excuse me.
I'm looking
for Dr. Ken Park.

00:07.241 --> 00:08.842
About yea high.

00:08.909 --> 00:12.546
Looks like an Asian lesbian,
acts like an Asian gay man.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.415
Clark, can you call
Tanya at Nail Depot

00:14.482 --> 00:16.117
and tell her next time
there's a bubble
in my top coat,

00:16.184 --> 00:18.452
I'm taking my business
elsewhere.
Absolutely.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.020
Buddy!
Doug!

00:20.088 --> 00:22.056
Oh, my.
Oh, look at you,
Mr. Clean.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.991
You here for a shine?
(IMITATES SQUEAKING)

00:24.058 --> 00:26.694
Look at you. Still working
at Doctors Without
Decorators, huh?

00:26.760 --> 00:27.795
(LAUGHS)

00:29.097 --> 00:30.764
This is my
old buddy Doug.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.434
He's a standup comic,
which means
he's bitter and poor.

00:33.501 --> 00:35.002
Better than being
short and ugly.

00:35.069 --> 00:37.037
Is it, Doug?

00:37.105 --> 00:39.340
You know what?
I'm in town for a couple days
at the Laugh Factory.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.842
Oh, is that no longer
a comedy club?
(LAUGHS)

00:43.277 --> 00:44.578
So, let me guess.

00:44.645 --> 00:46.180
You still don't have
health insurance,

00:46.247 --> 00:48.082
so you dropped by
for a free checkup?

00:48.149 --> 00:49.617
I was hoping
you could fit me in

00:49.683 --> 00:52.420
in between putting
toe tags on the
rest of your patients.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.787
Did he hear
about last week?

00:53.854 --> 00:55.123
(LAUGHS)

00:55.189 --> 00:56.857
Okay, all right,
just shut up, Julie.

00:58.092 --> 00:59.693
Hey, why don't you
talk that woman you duped

00:59.760 --> 01:01.395
into marrying you
to come to my show tonight?

01:01.462 --> 01:03.864
Ooh, yeah,
we'd love to hear
your fresh take

01:03.931 --> 01:08.269
on Internet dating
and how everyone's
eating kale. (CHUCKLES)

01:08.336 --> 01:10.738
I'll leave you
some comp tickets
at the box office.

01:10.804 --> 01:13.006
Comp tickets?
I'm intrigued.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.742
Who are you, friend?

01:14.808 --> 01:16.844
Pat, this is my buddy
Doug from college.
He does standup.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.079
Ah. Well, put me down
for one comp ticket.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.281
You a big comedy guy?

01:20.348 --> 01:23.351
No, I'm more
of a live sex show guy.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.785
But those are
hardly ever free.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.298
You guys,
why are we sitting here?

01:37.365 --> 01:38.899
Surgeons took
our table.

01:38.966 --> 01:41.169
Yeah, they think
they're so much
better than us.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.771
Why? Just 'cause they have
tons more education

01:43.837 --> 01:47.408
and way more money
and are more attractive?

01:47.475 --> 01:48.742
You know what, guys?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.211
They're better than us.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.913
They don't have
more money than me.

01:52.980 --> 01:56.049
I inherited a fortune
after that satellite fell
on my grandma.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.853
What? I never told
y'all that story?
(CHUCKLES)

01:59.920 --> 02:01.522
Craziest thing
I ever seen.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.424
(CLATTERING)

02:03.491 --> 02:05.058
Whoa.
(GROANS)

02:05.125 --> 02:06.460
This is ridiculous.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.761
We don't have
to take this.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.164
You know what?
Julie is right.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.533
We are gonna
march over there confidently,

02:12.600 --> 02:16.204
and Damona is going
to say something.

02:16.270 --> 02:18.339
MAN: Right there,
concierge
is standing there.

02:18.406 --> 02:20.007
I didn't notice at first.
I was there
myself to check...

02:20.073 --> 02:21.342
Excuse me, hi.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.444
I know you don't know this,
but we usually sit here.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.545
And who are you?

02:24.612 --> 02:26.480
Family Medicine.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.948
That's my
low-sodium soy sauce.
I just leave that there.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.284
That is how much
our table this is.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.652
Really enjoyed the chat.

02:31.719 --> 02:32.953
Now leave us alone.

02:33.020 --> 02:35.323
And that's how I met
Stephen Dorff.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.991
Uh, excuse me,
but I don't think
you heard me.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.461
I said this is our table.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.230
Oh, I heard you.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.064
So, what color Tesla
do you think
I should get?

02:44.131 --> 02:47.435
Okay, well,
can I at least get my
low sodium soy sauce back?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.536
This soy sauce?
Yeah.

02:48.602 --> 02:49.603
Right here?
Right there.

02:49.670 --> 02:50.671
Sure.
Thank you.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.806
(DAMONA GASPS)

02:52.873 --> 02:54.408
Your pastry!

02:54.475 --> 02:57.177
No, he did not do that
to your pastry!

03:00.514 --> 03:02.182
No. No.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.788
(DOORBELL RINGS)

03:11.625 --> 03:14.295
Oh, D.K.
Unannounced.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.530
Not unannounced.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.165
I rang doorbell.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.700
Melon ripe.
In season.

03:19.767 --> 03:21.902
Oh, good, another box
of unwanted fruit.

03:21.969 --> 03:24.137
And is it super heavy?

03:24.204 --> 03:25.506
(GRUNTING)
Perfect.

03:26.507 --> 03:27.675
Hey, Dad.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.543
Oh, we don't need those.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.944
Oh, you say that now,

03:31.011 --> 03:34.047
but when melon hunger hits,
best to have melon.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.484
So wise, Papa.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.952
Well, we got to get
to the Laugh Factory.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.754
Doug usually only gets
like five minutes.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.790
That's right.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.525
We missed him last time
because someone refused
to valet park.

03:44.592 --> 03:47.361
Oh, sure,
$20 cover and valet?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.229
Hey, why don't we buy
a tiger while we're at it?

03:49.297 --> 03:51.932
We'll live like rappers.

03:51.999 --> 03:55.569
Mom, Dad, there's this
new video game
that everyone has.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.971
If you really
want me to fit in
like you claim to,

03:58.038 --> 04:00.173
I need it immediately.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.710
Dave, you don't need
another violent video game.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.845
But Bloodlust
is educational.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.580
It's like
an anatomy lesson.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.350
When you win a sword fight,
your victim is cut wide open.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.519
You can see everything.
(LAUGHS)

04:12.486 --> 04:13.754
You want to take
this one?

04:13.821 --> 04:15.222
Fine.

04:15.289 --> 04:16.724
You'll have it
by tomorrow.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.225
No.
No!

04:18.292 --> 04:19.993
What's wrong with you,
Dave?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.194
Geez.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.935
You don't need
video game.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.370
You need exercise.

04:29.437 --> 04:32.072
Kids today just
sit on their butts
staring at screens.

04:32.139 --> 04:33.206
You're soft.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.642
He's not wrong.

04:36.477 --> 04:37.945
I'll make a deal.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.781
I'll buy you that
inappropriate video game

04:40.848 --> 04:43.250
if you can do
more pushups than me
by next week.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.520
Can you do more than zero?
That's his personal best.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.756
Yeah, and that's when
I was working out.

04:53.961 --> 04:56.196
See, Allison?
No valet. Not so bad.

04:56.263 --> 04:58.632
Yeah. I really enjoyed
the eight block
walk uphill.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.200
(LAUGHS)

05:00.267 --> 05:02.870
Well, thanks
for dropping me
off in front. (LAUGHS)

05:02.936 --> 05:05.639
Hey, Parks.
Thanks for saving me
a seat.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.907
We didn't.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.009
So...

05:09.076 --> 05:11.144
I did a little
light Googling
on your friend,

05:11.211 --> 05:13.246
and, uh, apparently
he is blowing up.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.683
Yeah, just recorded
a one hour comedy special

05:15.749 --> 05:19.353
and posted a scathing review
of a carpet store on Yelp.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.589
That's light Googling?

05:21.655 --> 05:22.990
Well, for me, yeah.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.593
When I go deep,
I can tell you
a guy's shoe size,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.060
little miss seven
and a half.

05:28.896 --> 05:30.431
Switch seats with me.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.269
Okay,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:36.336 --> 05:37.838
The Laugh Factory's
proud to present

05:37.905 --> 05:40.240
one of Variety's
top 10 comics to watch.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.975
You'll see him
on Jimmy Kimmel next week.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.444
He's here for you
right now.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.113
How about a big hand
for Mr. Doug Miller!

05:46.179 --> 05:47.415
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

05:49.817 --> 05:51.685
Hey, everybody!

05:51.752 --> 05:53.987
Thanks for coming out.
What's up, cutie?

05:54.054 --> 05:55.823
Thanks for sitting
in the front row.

05:55.889 --> 05:57.525
You brought
your Uber driver, great.

05:57.591 --> 05:59.292
(LAUGHTER)

05:59.359 --> 06:00.928
This girl asked me out
the other day.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.797
She told me
she was an actress
in porno movies.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.467
So, I was like,
"All right, well,
when do you want to go out?"

06:06.534 --> 06:09.236
She goes,
"Well, I'm working
Tuesday and Wednesday.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.004
"How about Thursday?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.807
"Uh... How about Monday?"

06:13.874 --> 06:15.943
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

06:16.009 --> 06:18.378
Yeah, he's been doing
that joke forever.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.714
I'm sorry.
Am I interrupting
your conversation?

06:20.781 --> 06:21.949
Oh, no, no, sorry.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.651
No, no, he was just
telling me

06:23.717 --> 06:25.185
you've been
doing that joke forever.

06:25.252 --> 06:26.353
Oh.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.621
I liked it, though.

06:27.688 --> 06:30.991
And Monday
was the right call.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.294
Folks, this is actually
my buddy Ken
from Duke.

06:34.361 --> 06:35.863
You should've seen
this guy in college.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.231
He really cleaned up
with the sorority girls.

06:38.298 --> 06:41.635
Yeah, his work-study job,
he was janitor for Tri Delt.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.271
(ALL LAUGH)

06:44.337 --> 06:46.807
I'm laughing.
I'm thinking.
I'm having a great time.

06:48.275 --> 06:50.944
You know what?
Every year,
Ken made Dean's list.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.846
Oh.
That's true.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.115
Yeah. Dean was our buddy
who made a list
of all the virgins.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.717
(ALL LAUGH)

06:57.417 --> 06:59.086
(FORCED LAUGHTER)

07:00.488 --> 07:03.056
In fact, Ken's major
was virginity

07:03.123 --> 07:05.092
with a minor
in never losing it.

07:05.158 --> 07:06.694
(LAUGHTER)

07:06.760 --> 07:09.096
No, it was Biochemistry.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.532
I don't get that.

07:11.599 --> 07:13.066
Ken, it's great
to see you.

07:13.133 --> 07:15.168
You have
a beautiful family, too.

07:15.235 --> 07:18.972
Lovely children
and a wife who insists
they're your kids.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.073
I don't know.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.642
(LAUGHS LOUDLY)

07:22.943 --> 07:25.212
Hey, both of our kids
are a product

07:25.278 --> 07:28.181
of the amazing sex
I had with this lady
right here.

07:30.317 --> 07:31.585
Switch seats with me.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.328
I had no idea
he was doing so well.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.631
Did you know back
at Duke,
I was the funny one?

07:43.697 --> 07:45.132
Yeah, it's come up.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.704
I'm sorry,
but if he can do it...

07:50.771 --> 07:52.139
Why didn't you
ever try it?

07:52.205 --> 07:53.807
I almost did.

07:53.874 --> 07:56.744
I mean, there's this bar
at Duke where Doug
was doing open mikes.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.579
I signed up, but when
I told my dad about it,

07:58.646 --> 08:01.014
he was like...
(IMITATING D.K.)
"Oh, you no Steven Wright.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.183
"You Steven Wrong.
(CHUCKLES)

08:03.250 --> 08:04.952
"Oh, there's joke
for you, joke boy.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.487
"Now back to library."

08:07.555 --> 08:10.490
Well, there's no reason
you can't give it
a shot now.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.059
Think so?

08:12.125 --> 08:13.861
Go try an open mike.

08:13.927 --> 08:16.697
Wouldn't that be better
than wondering what if
the rest of your life?

08:16.764 --> 08:17.998
I don't think so, Al.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.968
I've gotten pretty cozy
with what if.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.571
But I've always
had this idea
that I could get up there

08:23.637 --> 08:25.038
and do it, but...

08:25.105 --> 08:28.275
If I can't,
then the dream is gone.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.010
Or what if you can?

08:30.644 --> 08:31.645
(LAUGHS)

08:33.947 --> 08:36.249
That'd be pretty cool,
Allison. (LAUGHS)

08:38.218 --> 08:40.788
You know what?
I think I'm gonna do it.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.756
Yeah, you are!

08:42.823 --> 08:44.925
Oh, so exciting.
(CHUCKLES)

08:44.992 --> 08:46.794
Wait, you sure
you don't want to call
your daddy first

08:46.860 --> 08:48.095
and ask permission?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.630
It's ringing.
I was kidding.

08:49.697 --> 08:51.064
Oh, oh, so was I.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.438
(GRUNTING)

09:06.680 --> 09:10.117
Molly, do you happen
to know where I can find
any steroids?

09:10.718 --> 09:12.219
What?

09:12.285 --> 09:16.223
Zero pushups is hard enough,
but one is impossible.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.992
"Well, you'll get there,"
she said,
not meaning it at all.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.062
Wait, can you train me?

09:22.129 --> 09:24.031
Dave, pushups are like
riding a bike.

09:24.097 --> 09:27.234
You'll never be able
to do either of them.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.569
Oh, yeah?
If you don't help me,
I'll tell Mom and Dad

09:29.637 --> 09:31.705
about the fake ID
I saw in your purse.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.540
You're bluffing.

09:33.607 --> 09:35.575
Am I,
Madonna Bronkowitz?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.378
It's Burkowitz, okay?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.280
If I'm gonna help you,
get my name right.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.051
Hey, guys.

09:44.117 --> 09:45.786
Guess what
your dad's gonna do
Tuesday night.

09:45.853 --> 09:48.656
Finally spend
some quality time
with us?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.490
Nope.
Mol, any guesses?

09:50.557 --> 09:53.293
Something purely for you
that inflates your ego?

09:53.360 --> 09:55.929
Oh, so close!
(LAUGHS)

09:56.630 --> 09:58.165
I'll just say it.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.701
I'm gonna try standup.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.672
That's right!

10:04.738 --> 10:07.207
Your dad's gonna prove
he's not just funny
around the house.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.843
Like when he slammed
the cabinet door
on his thumb.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.112
(BOTH LAUGH)
Yeah.

10:12.179 --> 10:15.282
Okay, you know what?
Just for that,
neither of you are going.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.184
Well, they can't go anyway.
They're not 21.

10:17.250 --> 10:18.719
Yeah, and it's not like
either of us

10:18.786 --> 10:20.187
has a fake ID
in our purse.

10:21.989 --> 10:25.025
Oh, Dave,
you're so funny.
Let's get out of here.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.027
Stop right there,
young lady.

10:27.094 --> 10:29.396
And just why
do you think
Dave's so funny?

10:30.363 --> 10:31.531
Because
he got it from you?

10:31.598 --> 10:33.867
Exactly.
Now go have fun.

10:33.934 --> 10:35.268
Oh, and don't forget
your purse.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.704
Oh.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.547
Guys, guess what
I'm doing Tuesday night.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.183
Oh, finally taking me
to dinner for my birthday
like you've been promising?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.752
Nope.
Anyone else?

10:51.819 --> 10:53.153
Something completely
about yourself

10:53.220 --> 10:54.387
that you're gonna
drag us into?

10:54.454 --> 10:56.857
Oh, you're so close!
(LAUGHS)

10:56.924 --> 10:58.959
All right,
I'll just tell you. Um...

10:59.026 --> 11:02.129
I'm finally doing
an open mike
at the Laugh Factory.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.331
(GASPS)
That's so exciting!

11:04.397 --> 11:07.300
You've been
telling us forever
how funny you are.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.071
You're doing an open mike?
Well, I don't know.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.706
Based on what I witnessed
from you the other night,

11:12.773 --> 11:14.708
they might want to call it
an open grave.

11:14.775 --> 11:16.443
Thanks, Pat.

11:16.509 --> 11:17.878
You know,
'cause you're gonna
die up there.

11:17.945 --> 11:21.148
Got it.
Because you are
not funny.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.985
Oh, he's funny.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.453
Come on, little man.
Give us a taste.

11:26.519 --> 11:27.988

Okay. Okay.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.057
I just came up
with this one. Okay.
(CHUCKLES)

11:30.123 --> 11:31.258
Uh...

11:31.324 --> 11:33.493
Oh, you see
a lot of Asian doctors,

11:33.560 --> 11:36.196
but I've never seen
an Asian veterinarian.

11:36.263 --> 11:38.098

Not gonna happen.

11:39.599 --> 11:41.301
"Your doggie
not make it."

11:45.072 --> 11:47.174
Are you implying
that he ate the dog?

11:47.240 --> 11:48.776
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not implying.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.944
I'm saying
he ate the dog.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.147
Okay, that is
wildly offensive.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.083
Write this down.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.286
Not funny at all.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.521
Horrifying.
Aggressively racist.

12:01.588 --> 12:04.157

More like Setting
Your People Back Factory.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.993

12:06.059 --> 12:07.694
See, Ken,
it's not so hard.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.000
Okay, you guys,
this is really
constructive feedback.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.935
I've got it now,
and I'm gonna run with it.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.236
So thank you.
DAMONA: All right.
Good.

12:16.303 --> 12:17.704
Actually, if it was
a cat instead...

12:17.771 --> 12:19.072
No! Oh, my God!
No!

12:19.139 --> 12:20.908
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Back to work, then.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.780
People.
Hear ye.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.082
The cafeteria wars
will soon be over,

12:29.149 --> 12:33.320
and those surgeons will be
waving the white flag
of surrender.

12:33.386 --> 12:36.423
What in the hell
are you talking about?

12:36.489 --> 12:39.793
Sorry, I've been
kind of bingeing on
Game of Thrones. (CHUCKLES)

12:39.860 --> 12:43.530
Anyhoo, I took
the bolts off the table.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.332
And as soon as those
smug bastards

12:45.398 --> 12:47.267
put any weight on it,
that thing is gonna

12:47.334 --> 12:51.704
come crashing down
like a satellite
on Damona's grandma.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.942
Well, Clark, you know,
we're not up here
because of the surgeons.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.643
Pediatrics is using
the cafeteria.

12:56.709 --> 12:57.811
They're throwing
the kids a party.

12:59.279 --> 13:01.181
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

13:01.248 --> 13:02.782
No!

13:10.457 --> 13:13.626
I thought the balloons...
(PANTING)
Would break my fall.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.400

So, that's what it's gonna
sound like on my end.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.654
Kids, Dad says
he has something important
to talk to us about.

13:41.721 --> 13:45.258
Thanks, Al.
Now, listen up, guys.
This affects all of us.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.227
I was working
on some material
that I realize might be

13:47.294 --> 13:50.063
offensive to Asians,
animals, and Julie,

13:50.130 --> 13:51.364
who had to take
a half day,

13:51.431 --> 13:53.867
so I broke out
some of the stuff I use

13:53.934 --> 13:55.568
when I host
the HMO banquet.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.437
(CLEARS THROAT)

some lazy nurses do
on their day off?

14:00.107 --> 14:02.342
Same thing they do
on their day on.
(CHUCKLES)

14:06.713 --> 14:08.281
You know,
'cause they're lazy.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.050

14:12.285 --> 14:15.188
Now that I understand it,
I love it!

Nurses.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.264
Pap smear. Uh...

14:24.864 --> 14:26.599
Pap smear.

14:26.666 --> 14:29.002
Pap smear campaign.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.337
No, no, no, no.
Too political.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.040
Ken, come to bed.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.775
I appreciate the offer, Al,
but I'm not feeling it
right now.

this weekend.

It's 2:00 in the morning.

14:41.648 --> 14:44.684
I can't.
The open mike's tomorrow,
and I've got nothing.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.419
Okay, let me help you.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.787
Um...

14:47.854 --> 14:49.256
Oh, here's something.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.124
You know how
there's a backup camera
on our car?

14:51.191 --> 14:53.326
Yeah?
Why don't you do
something with that?

14:57.697 --> 15:00.133
Thanks, Al.
That's great.

backup camera bit.

Okay, you don't have
to be nasty about it.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.845
I'm sorry.
I'm just freaking out.

I know you, Ken,
and if you back out now,

15:23.490 --> 15:25.993
it'll eat at you
for the rest of your life.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.996

You can do this.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.497

what we talked about.

into doing this stuff.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.817
It's not like I went
up to my dad and said,

19:44.884 --> 19:46.118
"Gee, Papa,
when I grow up,

19:46.185 --> 19:47.854
"I want to be a doctor
and save lives."

19:47.920 --> 19:49.822
(IMITATING D.K.)
"No, no. You tell joke!"

19:49.889 --> 19:51.658
(LAUGHTER)

19:51.724 --> 19:53.493
I would never say that.

19:55.962 --> 19:58.565
(NORMAL VOICE)
It was really easy for me
to get in med school.

19:58.631 --> 20:01.534
I mean...
I mean, look at me.
It's like my birthright.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.802
Here was my interview.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.637
"So, Ken,
tell me about yourself."

20:04.704 --> 20:05.705
"Well, I'm Korean."

20:05.772 --> 20:07.173
"Stop! Congratulations.
You're in."

20:07.240 --> 20:09.208
That's it. That's it.
(LAUGHTER)

20:10.677 --> 20:11.811
(APPLAUSE)

20:17.484 --> 20:18.918
(LAUGHING)

20:20.320 --> 20:21.621
Dad, you were awesome.

20:21.688 --> 20:22.889
(LAUGHING)

20:22.955 --> 20:24.691
He was amazing.

20:24.757 --> 20:27.260
And I knew you would be.
You're welcome.

20:27.327 --> 20:28.695
(LAUGHS)

20:29.562 --> 20:31.431
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

20:31.498 --> 20:32.799
What's that?

20:32.865 --> 20:36.135
It's Jamie Masada,
owner of the Laugh Factory.

20:36.202 --> 20:37.970
He says he wants
to manage me.

20:39.372 --> 20:42.241
So, are you gonna
do this?

20:42.309 --> 20:46.045
Nah. I just wanted
to prove I could do
standup, that's all.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.747
You know,
you were really good.

20:47.814 --> 20:49.616
Great even,
but come on.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.484
What am I gonna do,

20:51.551 --> 20:54.487
give up being a doctor
and become a comedian?

20:54.554 --> 20:56.789
That is pretty
ridiculous. (LAUGHS)

20:56.856 --> 20:58.090
"No more
medicine for me.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.459
"I'm gonna...
I'm gonna hit the road

20:59.526 --> 21:01.260
"and perform at
the Funny Bone
in El Paso."

21:01.328 --> 21:02.929
(ALL LAUGH)

21:02.995 --> 21:04.997
Hey, maybe they'll
put you in movies.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.766
(ALL LAUGH)

21:06.833 --> 21:08.335
Or your own TV show.

21:08.401 --> 21:10.002
(ALL LAUGH)

21:10.069 --> 21:11.504
I guess you guys
are right.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.139
That's full-on crazy.

21:13.205 --> 21:15.575
(ALL LAUGH)

21:15.642 --> 21:17.777
ALLISON: "I'm just gonna
throw my medical degree
in the street."

21:17.844 --> 21:19.245
(LAUGHTER)
