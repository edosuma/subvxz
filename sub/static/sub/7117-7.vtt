00:24.686 --> 00:27.484

00:27.484 --> 00:31.680

01:06.625 --> 01:10.053

01:32.226 --> 01:35.414
Okay, now shhhh...

It's not that I don't love
running this school. I do.

01:40.211 --> 01:43.798
But I've fallen in love
with a Tahitian woman,

01:44.367 --> 01:46.776

01:51.063 --> 01:53.221

Excuse me!

02:28.455 --> 02:30.984
But you were the one who came
speeding in here like a maniac and...

02:30.984 --> 02:33.881

02:33.881 --> 02:35.480
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

12:26.449 --> 12:29.008

- Shhhhhh.

12:29.008 --> 12:30.906
- B... but, you're in the bathtub...
- Shhhhhh!

12:30.916 --> 12:32.515
Stop it!

12:32.515 --> 12:33.674
Ahhhhhhh!

12:34.104 --> 12:36.792
Pop goes the weasel.

Did you like it?

14:23.674 --> 14:25.603
Next!

14:29.949 --> 14:32.707
So do you feel like you did well?

14:32.717 --> 14:33.847
I think.

14:34.186 --> 14:35.865
I mean, Andre wrote an amazing song,

14:35.915 --> 14:38.093
and he said we sounded great together.

14:38.263 --> 14:39.702
And Trina?

14:39.772 --> 14:41.281
Uhh, not so good.

14:41.451 --> 14:42.650
Oh.

14:44.119 --> 14:46.267
I don't get the point of this exercise.

14:49.365 --> 14:52.933
Oh, I got it. Take a break.

14:55.091 --> 14:57.299
- It's your school.
- Answer it.

14:58.319 --> 15:00.117
Hello?

15:00.117 --> 15:02.686
Yeah, this is she.

15:02.686 --> 15:05.823
Oh! Oh, thank you.
She'll be so happy.

15:05.823 --> 15:08.012
That's great news!

15:08.751 --> 15:10.850
Uh-huh.

15:11.129 --> 15:12.618
What?
But...

15:12.628 --> 15:14.197
Shhhh! Shh! Shh!

15:15.876 --> 15:17.775
Thank you for calling.

15:19.693 --> 15:20.423
Uhhh!

15:20.423 --> 15:22.691
I told Trina to rehearse for our audition.

15:22.691 --> 15:25.259
I told her that our new
principal's really tough,

15:25.259 --> 15:28.757
- but she just didn't...
- Trina passed her audition.

15:29.516 --> 15:30.715
She did?

15:32.704 --> 15:34.023
Then...

15:34.582 --> 15:36.991
You didn't.

15:37.001 --> 15:38.250
I...

15:39.998 --> 15:42.027
They're kicking me out of Hollywood arts?

15:42.027 --> 15:44.675
I am so sorry, baby.

15:46.434 --> 15:48.332
Are you gonna cry?

15:48.702 --> 15:50.800
I dunno.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.799
Do you wanna cry?

15:53.259 --> 15:54.798
I dunno.

15:55.427 --> 15:57.496
- You're gonna cry.
- I know.

16:25.755 --> 16:28.573
- I made it dim...
- I mean, I don't get it.

16:28.573 --> 16:30.671
They can't just kick Tori outta school.

16:30.681 --> 16:32.110
Yeah, they can.

16:32.880 --> 16:34.079
Okay, well.

16:34.079 --> 16:36.007
I'm going home now...

16:36.137 --> 16:37.746
- Forever.
- No.

16:38.676 --> 16:41.134
- You're not leaving this school.
- She has to.

16:43.482 --> 16:48.079
I mean, I feel really bad about
it, seriously, but, y'know...

16:48.828 --> 16:49.997
Bye.

16:51.346 --> 16:53.645
I think I'll miss you least of all.

16:54.084 --> 16:55.943
Wait, what do you mean she's not leavin'?

16:55.943 --> 16:58.391
I mean, we're all gonna talk
to Helen about this right now.

16:58.531 --> 17:00.420
- Yeah, let's.
- Yeah, let's do that.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.959
But what are you guys gonna say?

17:02.588 --> 17:05.226
That if you have to leave
Hollywood arts, I'm leaving too.

17:05.886 --> 17:07.574
You'd do that for me?

17:08.773 --> 17:11.721
Nooooooooo, I really love this school.

17:14.020 --> 17:15.579
Well...

17:15.719 --> 17:17.237
I'm gonna go get some gum.

17:20.055 --> 17:21.824
Come on, let's go find Helen.

17:21.824 --> 17:23.752
- Yeah, let's go.
- Come on.

17:23.762 --> 17:25.761
- Helen... find her.
- We're gonna get that girl!

17:25.761 --> 17:26.960
You know what?
Helen is this way.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.628
- No, it's this way.
- Where is she?

17:33.566 --> 17:35.064
Hey.

17:35.064 --> 17:36.823
Did you all want something?

17:40.361 --> 17:42.999
We don't think Tori should be
kicked out of the school.

17:42.999 --> 17:45.517
- Ahhh, Tori?
- Vega.

17:46.496 --> 17:48.894
Oh, yeah. Tori Vega.

17:48.894 --> 17:53.061
My notes here say she was kicked out
because she's untalented and irritating.

17:53.071 --> 17:56.069
Excuse me, but a lot of people
think that I am talented.

17:56.069 --> 17:58.827
You? Oh, you are.
And pretty as a Pickle.

18:00.066 --> 18:03.004
Now why are you children
asking me about Tori Vega?

18:03.004 --> 18:04.803
I'm Tori Vega.

18:04.803 --> 18:06.631
No, no, no, no.

18:06.641 --> 18:09.329
This is Tori Vega.

18:11.578 --> 18:14.026
Duh duh dunnnn!

18:14.805 --> 18:18.003
No. No, no, no.
That's my older sister, Trina Vega.

18:18.003 --> 18:19.322
Ohhhh.

18:19.492 --> 18:23.609
- You mixed up the names!
- I have personal problems.

18:23.609 --> 18:26.777
- I knew it was a mistake.
- You get to stay!

18:28.446 --> 18:29.874
Yeah. But wait, wait, wait.

18:29.874 --> 18:32.013
You can't kick trina out of Hollywood arts.

18:32.013 --> 18:34.011
Right, guys?

18:34.011 --> 18:35.610
Oooooh...

18:35.610 --> 18:37.159
I'm sorry, what was the question?

18:37.759 --> 18:41.516
Look, I'm sorry. I'll call Trina
myself and give her the new...

18:41.516 --> 18:42.775
No, no, no. Please don't.

18:43.584 --> 18:45.013
I'll tell her.

18:45.013 --> 18:47.612
All right... bye!

18:48.351 --> 18:49.670
Come on!

18:51.479 --> 18:53.417
You guys, I don't wanna be alone

18:53.417 --> 18:55.376
when I tell trina she got kicked out of...

19:00.242 --> 19:05.019
And, um, you know, um,

19:05.019 --> 19:08.666
sometimes when life hands you lemons...

19:10.255 --> 19:12.823
- You, uhhh, you...
- Tori.

19:12.823 --> 19:14.052
What?

19:15.791 --> 19:19.588
- I know what you're trying to say.
- You do?

19:19.588 --> 19:22.756
You're embarrassed that you got
kicked out of Hollywood arts.

19:24.325 --> 19:25.734
Ohhhhh...

19:27.263 --> 19:28.921
It's okay.

19:28.921 --> 19:31.320
It doesn't mean that you have zero talent.

19:33.658 --> 19:37.055
- Trina... I...
- You think this is easy for me?

19:37.065 --> 19:39.444
- 'Cause it's not.
- What's not?

19:39.634 --> 19:42.052
Being the talented one in our family.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.919
That's a lotta pressure.

19:46.429 --> 19:49.726
And you're my baby sister.
It hurts me when you fail.

19:51.995 --> 19:53.134
Oh, man.

19:54.063 --> 19:58.930
And listen... If I could just
somehow suck some talent out of me

19:58.930 --> 20:01.807
and sprinkle it all over you,

20:03.506 --> 20:04.715
I swear...

20:05.365 --> 20:07.393
I would consider doing that.

20:09.402 --> 20:12.070
Now... you want me to make you
some cream of wheat?

20:12.260 --> 20:13.999
I hate cream of wheat.

20:14.009 --> 20:16.027
Yeah, but I love it.

20:19.075 --> 20:21.063
How can you not love cream of wheat?

20:21.063 --> 20:22.213
Rex.

20:23.412 --> 20:26.809
Look. Helen gets to school
at 6:30 every morning.

20:26.809 --> 20:30.007
I'll come up with some reason to get Trina
to school right before Helen shows up.

20:30.007 --> 20:31.276
I love cream of wheat.

20:33.744 --> 20:37.012
You're gonna be dressed
as a robber, with a ski mask.

20:37.012 --> 20:39.230
- I like skiing.
- Yeah, yeah...

20:39.620 --> 20:42.468
So when Helen walks into school,
you attack her.

20:42.468 --> 20:45.446
- Why?
- 'Cause! Trina's taking karate,

20:45.446 --> 20:47.444
so when she sees Helen being attacked,

20:47.444 --> 20:49.882
trina'll jump in, beat you up,
and then Helen'll be grateful

20:49.882 --> 20:51.711
and let Trina stay at Hollywood arts.

20:51.711 --> 20:53.480
But I hate being beaten.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.199
I always have.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.246
I need you to do this.

20:58.246 --> 21:00.305
- No.
- Please?

21:00.405 --> 21:01.744
All right.

21:08.949 --> 21:11.557
Tori?
It's 6:00 in the morning,

21:11.557 --> 21:14.884
I'm at school, and they are not
having a free breakfast buffet.

21:16.593 --> 21:18.022
Call me.

21:18.292 --> 21:20.720
Hello? Anybody here?

21:20.720 --> 21:22.659
Anyone seen a breakfast buffet?

21:22.659 --> 21:24.427
Hello?

21:25.526 --> 21:27.725
Andre just texted me from the parking lot!

21:27.725 --> 21:29.324
Helen is on her way in!

21:29.324 --> 21:30.823
I'm afraid.

21:31.042 --> 21:33.840
It's just a beating.

21:35.259 --> 21:36.289
Put your thing on!

21:45.532 --> 21:48.400
♪ You don't have to be afraid ♪
♪ to put your dreams in action ♪.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.359
Hey, gimme the bag!

21:49.369 --> 21:50.458
Oh! Oh!

21:50.468 --> 21:52.926
- Give me your bag!
- May day! May day!

21:52.936 --> 21:56.834
- Help me!
- Get away from her!

21:56.834 --> 21:58.253
Oh, Jesus!

22:01.230 --> 22:02.569
Hold him still so I can whack him!

22:02.569 --> 22:05.827
Hey! Hey, what's goin' on?!
Hey!

22:06.836 --> 22:09.664
- What happened?!
- Oh, this...

22:09.674 --> 22:12.502
This hooligan came
and tried to bushwhack me!

22:12.502 --> 22:14.271
Ohhhh wow!

22:14.271 --> 22:16.569
I mean what are the odds
of a masked robber...

22:16.569 --> 22:22.175
- Then I... going, going, going.
- Man... it was a good thing that Trina was here to protect you.

22:22.295 --> 22:26.202
Oh! Heck yeah.
Thank you, baby. I owe ya one.

22:26.212 --> 22:27.641
Yeah. Like...

22:27.641 --> 22:29.770
Maybe you wanna reconsider
a decision you made

22:29.780 --> 22:32.458
about someone being kicked out
of Hollywood arts?

22:33.247 --> 22:34.736
Oh.

22:36.715 --> 22:38.873
Mmm-hmm, you right.

22:38.873 --> 22:41.341
- Trina, you can...
- So I can keep going to school here?

22:41.341 --> 22:43.410
You? Yeah, I thought
you were gonna tell Trina she...

22:43.410 --> 22:45.878
Yay, we both get to stay at Hollywood arts!

22:45.878 --> 22:47.577
C'mon Trina, let's go get
some cream of wheat!

22:47.577 --> 22:48.746
I thought you hated cream of wheat.

22:48.746 --> 22:51.414
But now I love it!
This way...

22:51.414 --> 22:53.242
And I thought crazy Steve was crazy.

22:53.882 --> 22:55.871
All right,
better call the police to come get...

22:56.640 --> 22:57.859
All right then.
