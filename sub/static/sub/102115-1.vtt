the club intentionally?

I want you to have a drink.

52:11.737 --> 52:13.391
My wife's coat, her lipstick,
her perfume,

52:13.521 --> 52:15.871
- even her fucking accent!
- You're hurting me!

52:16.002 --> 52:18.047
You tell me what's going on,
or I'll really fucking hurt you.

52:18.178 --> 52:19.571
Then you won't know
what happened.

52:19.701 --> 52:21.573
You won't know what you did.

52:22.704 --> 52:24.141
I know you loved her too.

52:44.552 --> 52:47.468
[moaning]

53:09.925 --> 53:12.450
Did Karim send you?
You have to tell me.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.234
[laughs]

53:14.365 --> 53:16.584
If he had, you'd be dead.

53:16.715 --> 53:18.586
So what do you want?
Just tell me what you want!

53:18.717 --> 53:20.588
I just want you to remember!

53:22.503 --> 53:24.375
I don't wanna remember.

53:24.505 --> 53:26.203
I don't wanna remember!

53:26.333 --> 53:29.206
So I just pull this trigger,
and it ends!

53:30.946 --> 53:33.471
But will it, Jack?

53:33.601 --> 53:34.646
Will it?

53:49.574 --> 53:53.230
Come and see me sing tonight.
I know you like to watch.

54:01.455 --> 54:04.328
JACK: Karim was stealing
from the club.

54:04.458 --> 54:07.156
Way more than the 10 million
we owed him.

54:09.202 --> 54:11.204
But we needed evidence.

54:16.731 --> 54:18.429
It's an old-school method,
Darren.

54:19.821 --> 54:22.084
Nothing high-tech, you know.

54:22.215 --> 54:24.217
You'll scream,

54:24.348 --> 54:26.045
a bit of begging,

54:26.175 --> 54:28.265
then you'll tell Mr. Stracken
over there

54:28.395 --> 54:30.832
everything he wants to know.

54:32.007 --> 54:35.446
Oh, no, no, no, no pressure.

54:35.576 --> 54:38.797
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we...

54:38.927 --> 54:41.930
A few practice go's first,
yeah?

54:42.061 --> 54:44.585
Get you up to speed.

54:44.716 --> 54:46.587
He's ripping us off.

54:47.980 --> 54:49.373
I'm just an agent.

54:49.503 --> 54:52.027
It's Karim, isn't it?

54:57.076 --> 54:59.687
It's funny, Darren.

54:59.818 --> 55:02.429
Calm down, calm down.

55:02.560 --> 55:04.997
That's it.

Never show your weakness.

55:43.775 --> 55:45.516
Close your eyes.

55:51.696 --> 55:53.132
Nothing to worry about,
all right?

55:53.262 --> 55:54.220
JACK: Turn it off.

55:54.351 --> 55:56.875
Watch it.

55:57.005 --> 55:59.747
- Please.

56:09.670 --> 56:12.543
Go to your Australia,
whatever.

56:12.673 --> 56:14.414
Honey, I love you.

56:14.545 --> 56:17.112
I love you too.

56:17.243 --> 56:19.898
But this is not about love.

56:28.210 --> 56:31.779
[bell tolling]

56:42.007 --> 56:44.052
You wanted information
about the stadium deal.

56:44.183 --> 56:45.271
You know I do.

56:45.402 --> 56:46.359
Yeah.

56:46.490 --> 56:50.232
Yeah, so what's it worth?

56:50.363 --> 56:52.583
Oh, come on, Jack.
I'm on your side. You know I am.

56:52.713 --> 56:54.149
Come on, I was the one
who secured the votes.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.586
I paid everyone off, all right?

56:55.716 --> 56:57.414
And then all that stuff
with the council.

56:59.677 --> 57:01.940
I know who's doing
the stealing for Karim.

57:06.466 --> 57:07.467
Beaumont.

57:10.427 --> 57:11.819
Speak to him.

57:16.955 --> 57:19.131
[sobbing]

57:21.699 --> 57:23.048
He said--

57:23.178 --> 57:26.051
No, Benny,
you fucking listen to me.

57:28.575 --> 57:31.186
How long you been
working for him?

57:33.014 --> 57:34.929
I don't know what you're
talking about, Jack.

57:35.060 --> 57:37.236
It's me, Benny!

57:37.366 --> 57:40.195
Please, please.

57:40.326 --> 57:43.634
You'd have your share,
if you'd just been smart enough.

57:43.764 --> 57:47.507
If you hung on
just a little bit longer.

57:47.638 --> 57:51.511
But you always were
a selfish little prick.

57:51.642 --> 57:53.382
Oh, Christ, please.

57:53.513 --> 57:57.038
I'm the one that told you
about the missing money.

57:57.169 --> 58:00.346
I know you too well, Benny.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.262
You did the deal, and when you
got greedy, you asked for more.

58:03.392 --> 58:05.960
Karim said no,
and you bottled it.

58:06.091 --> 58:10.182

58:26.807 --> 58:27.939
What?

58:28.069 --> 58:29.680
I said fucking
plug it in, Grant.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.475
JACK: It's all coming back now.

58:42.606 --> 58:44.782
But if Karim knows
where I am, why send her?

58:44.912 --> 58:46.435

59:05.411 --> 59:08.327
VERONIQUE: He will find us
wherever we go.

He will crush us!

59:26.867 --> 59:28.739
Yeah.

59:28.869 --> 59:31.219
So I've been doing some digging,
and I've got some info for you.

59:31.350 --> 59:33.308
Okay, go on.

59:33.439 --> 59:36.442
Not on the phone, Mr. Grant.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.183
Okay, then where?

59:40.359 --> 59:41.403
Okay, shoot.

59:47.540 --> 59:48.802
[coughs]

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:18.615
Hello?

1:00:34.108 --> 1:00:35.109
Why her?

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:03.050
FLEET: Oh, God. All this again?JACK: Did I kill Ronny?

1:01:03.181 --> 1:01:04.530
I don't know, Jack.
I wasn't there.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.967
But you read
the police report, right?

1:01:07.098 --> 1:01:09.578
I can't remember the details.

1:01:09.709 --> 1:01:12.451
What was the gun?
Was it a Remington?

1:01:12.581 --> 1:01:14.845
Was she shot in the front
or the back?

1:01:14.975 --> 1:01:17.891
I don't know
what gun it was, but...

1:01:18.022 --> 1:01:20.328
[sighs]

1:01:20.459 --> 1:01:22.417
Jack, Ronny was shot
in the front.

1:01:22.548 --> 1:01:24.898
- That means I killed her.
- Don't say that, Jack.

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:26.291
Yes, I did.

1:01:26.421 --> 1:01:29.424
No, okay, well, maybe...

1:01:29.555 --> 1:01:32.210
- You knew and never told me.
- Jack...

1:01:32.340 --> 1:01:33.820
You let me believe
he killed her.

1:01:33.951 --> 1:01:35.692
God, you want to have
all the pressure.

1:01:35.822 --> 1:01:38.172
-Why would you do that for me? -You were aiming at him, right?

1:01:38.303 --> 1:01:40.305
Maybe your finger slipped.

1:01:40.435 --> 1:01:42.481
Maybe it...

1:01:42.611 --> 1:01:44.004
it was easier.

1:01:44.135 --> 1:01:46.006
Easier for who?

1:01:46.137 --> 1:01:49.923
Easier for me to trust you,
to tell you where I was.

1:01:50.054 --> 1:01:53.231
Okay, hang on.
You don't know that, Jack.

1:02:20.171 --> 1:02:22.129
What are you doing here, Tom?

1:02:26.133 --> 1:02:28.875
I'm hunting.

1:02:29.006 --> 1:02:31.356

1:02:31.486 --> 1:02:34.185
This is my cabin.

You are hunting too,
Mr. Leyton?

1:02:40.757 --> 1:02:43.977
That's not a gun
for killing rabbits.

1:02:46.632 --> 1:02:48.677
Hunt somewhere else, Tom.

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:52.812
Wherever you say, Mr. Leyton.

1:03:07.218 --> 1:03:08.610

1:03:59.748 --> 1:04:01.576
You know...

1:04:01.707 --> 1:04:06.668
we made a deal to spare Jack,

1:04:06.799 --> 1:04:11.717
then he goes
and takes my money.

1:04:14.198 --> 1:04:16.896
What do you mean, we?

Karim knew we were onto him.

It's no fucking mystery, Benny.

A pussy.

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:25.399
He's lucky to be paid.

to find another...

1:05:28.489 --> 1:05:31.231
He's just a little fucking...

1:05:31.362 --> 1:05:33.320

You could never run anything

your fucking ass!

It's done.

1:06:55.794 --> 1:06:58.405
Are you fucking stupid?

1:06:58.536 --> 1:07:00.886
You know what he did to me!

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:03.715
You think we can
run away from this?

1:07:03.845 --> 1:07:07.849

1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:10.156

Hey.

In every way.

Why didn't you just leave?

1:10:14.035 --> 1:10:18.126
A street girl
from Saint-Lunaire.

1:10:18.257 --> 1:10:20.825
A fighter struggling, huh?

1:10:20.955 --> 1:10:24.524
You think a girl like that
just gonna settle down for you?

1:10:24.655 --> 1:10:26.265
You can't cage her.

1:10:26.396 --> 1:10:29.137
You don't love her.
You fucking cut her.

1:10:29.268 --> 1:10:30.835
[chuckles]

1:10:30.965 --> 1:10:32.837
Is that what she told you?

1:10:32.967 --> 1:10:36.623
She begs me to hurt her
every time we fucked,

1:10:36.754 --> 1:10:39.931
and whatever I do,
it's never enough.

1:10:53.292 --> 1:10:54.946
[whimpering]

1:10:55.076 --> 1:10:57.818
We convince him
you're going to kill me.

1:10:57.949 --> 1:10:58.993
[chuckles]

1:10:59.124 --> 1:11:00.343
[Veronique screaming]

1:11:00.473 --> 1:11:01.779
What do you want?

1:11:01.909 --> 1:11:04.695
10 million, cash.

1:11:04.825 --> 1:11:06.566
And what if I say no?

1:11:06.697 --> 1:11:10.091
Oh, then you have to
reassemble the parts yourself.

1:11:10.222 --> 1:11:14.400
How am I gonna get 10 million?
You've taken everything.

1:11:14.531 --> 1:11:19.492
Think of it as
full settlement of your debt.

1:11:19.623 --> 1:11:22.669
And, oh, uh...

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:26.412
thank you
for disposing of Beaumont.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.677
Vee...

1:11:30.808 --> 1:11:35.029
Jack will never
appreciate you the way I do.

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:37.162
I get you the cash you need,

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:39.643
you get me onto
the board of directors,

1:11:39.773 --> 1:11:42.863
and you spare Jack's life.

1:11:42.994 --> 1:11:44.865
[chuckles]

1:11:44.996 --> 1:11:50.828
So finally,
the leopard reveals her spots.

1:11:50.958 --> 1:11:52.438
[chuckles]

1:11:52.569 --> 1:11:56.399
Talk to that lawyer, Fleet.

1:11:58.096 --> 1:12:02.187
Let's pretend you can do
what you say you can.

1:12:02.318 --> 1:12:07.105
How can we be sure
that he's going to pay?

1:12:07.235 --> 1:12:09.499
It's my life.

1:12:09.629 --> 1:12:12.458
Jack will pay.

1:12:12.589 --> 1:12:15.287
We got collateral debts to you.

1:12:16.419 --> 1:12:17.681
Well...

1:12:20.727 --> 1:12:23.251
I have three conditions.

1:12:23.382 --> 1:12:28.256
One: 10 million in cash.

1:12:28.387 --> 1:12:32.304
Two: Jack is humiliated,

1:12:32.435 --> 1:12:35.438
and if he ever shows
his face again,

1:12:35.568 --> 1:12:39.703
the heavens plays
for death of a princess.

1:12:39.833 --> 1:12:42.358
What's the third condition?

1:12:50.278 --> 1:12:51.976
You.

1:12:56.154 --> 1:12:59.287
[seagulls squawking]

1:13:16.957 --> 1:13:18.481
On us, Mr. Leyton.

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:33.017
Stay for a few more.
Keep the bar open.

1:13:35.759 --> 1:13:38.065
You look like
you can use it.

1:13:53.559 --> 1:13:56.257
JACK: What did she do
after she killed Benny?

1:14:00.392 --> 1:14:03.439
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:14:03.569 --> 1:14:05.528
I'm here because of you.

1:14:12.578 --> 1:14:13.492
Do you like it?

1:14:14.754 --> 1:14:15.929
Jack, Jack, stop!

1:14:16.060 --> 1:14:17.844
[tires screeching]

1:14:20.368 --> 1:14:21.500
[horn honks]

1:14:21.631 --> 1:14:23.371
Jack, you could have
killed us both!

1:14:23.502 --> 1:14:25.678
Tell me everything you know,
and I'll take you to the money.

1:14:25.809 --> 1:14:27.114
Fuck the money!

1:14:31.510 --> 1:14:34.426
Look, it's not safe
for you here!

1:14:34.557 --> 1:14:36.384
I'm worried about you, Page!

1:14:36.515 --> 1:14:40.127
These people, Zaney, Karim,
you have no fucking idea!

1:14:40.258 --> 1:14:43.957
You're worried about me?
Why'd you put a gun to my head?

1:14:44.088 --> 1:14:46.438
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1:14:48.832 --> 1:14:51.487
I'm losing my fucking mind here.

1:14:53.010 --> 1:14:55.491
Will you please
just get back in the car?

1:14:57.405 --> 1:14:58.711
Please.

1:15:06.632 --> 1:15:07.981
JACK: I realize there are
people out there

1:15:08.112 --> 1:15:09.809
who don't much care about me.

1:15:09.940 --> 1:15:12.464
About us, Page.

1:15:12.595 --> 1:15:15.380
So from now on,
I'm gonna protect you.

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:17.774
PAGE: How will you
protect me, Jack?

1:15:17.904 --> 1:15:20.385
JACK: Look, when this
is all sorted,

1:15:20.516 --> 1:15:22.430
I'm gonna start fresh.

1:15:22.561 --> 1:15:25.129
Australia.

1:15:25.259 --> 1:15:26.478
You should come too.

1:15:34.747 --> 1:15:36.009
Here.

1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:37.663
Merci.

1:15:43.887 --> 1:15:45.932
I want the same, you know.

1:15:46.063 --> 1:15:49.545
Did you tell him
about the money?

1:15:52.896 --> 1:15:55.028
Okay, forget it.
I'll deal with it.

1:15:55.159 --> 1:15:57.030
Tell me about London.

1:16:04.255 --> 1:16:05.996
She put me there.

1:16:08.912 --> 1:16:11.392
I had no idea.

1:16:11.523 --> 1:16:12.916
Ronny?

1:16:15.005 --> 1:16:17.224
So we both lost her.

1:16:20.097 --> 1:16:23.491
Maybe she had more to lose
than either of us.

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:26.494
I just need a minute.

1:16:31.891 --> 1:16:35.547
JACK: I overheard  a conversation, long forgotten.

1:16:35.678 --> 1:16:38.332
Couldn't make sense of it
at the time.

1:16:38.463 --> 1:16:40.465
But now...

1:16:40.596 --> 1:16:43.903
[speaking French]

1:16:53.217 --> 1:16:55.306
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:16:57.177 --> 1:16:59.223
VERONIQUE: You think this is
all about the money?

1:16:59.353 --> 1:17:00.877
Poor Jack.

1:17:03.444 --> 1:17:05.142
[distant gunshot]

1:17:12.062 --> 1:17:13.193
Page?

1:17:29.732 --> 1:17:32.560
Don't let him hurt me.

1:17:32.691 --> 1:17:33.692
[gunshot]

1:17:41.047 --> 1:17:43.746
PAGE: Zaney says
you're sitting on a fortune.

1:17:43.876 --> 1:17:46.226
ZANEY: I'm not the low-life
you think I am.

1:17:46.357 --> 1:17:47.314
[horn honks]

1:17:57.716 --> 1:17:58.935
I'm looking for Zaney.

1:17:59.065 --> 1:18:01.589
Oh, hasn't been in yet.

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:03.722
Are you sure
he's not here, Tom?

1:18:03.853 --> 1:18:05.593
His van's outside.
The door's open.

1:18:05.724 --> 1:18:06.986
Lots of people all day.

1:18:07.117 --> 1:18:10.381
He's never usually late
like this.

1:18:11.469 --> 1:18:12.949
Any message?

1:18:14.254 --> 1:18:16.909
GRANT: Jack, we need to talk.

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:19.738
Lane's alive.  He's got that picture of Ronny,

1:18:19.869 --> 1:18:21.609
the one you said
the girl stole.

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:23.873
Holla back, yeah? ASAP.

1:18:29.574 --> 1:18:31.750
This is Grant. Leave a message. [beep]

1:18:31.881 --> 1:18:33.534
JACK: Grant,
for Christ's sake, call me.

1:18:33.665 --> 1:18:35.188
It's him.

1:18:35.319 --> 1:18:38.104
- [phone buzzing]
- Time to perform, Fleet.

1:18:44.807 --> 1:18:46.634
Fleet, what's going on?
Is Grant there to see you?

1:18:46.765 --> 1:18:49.333
Your friend's disappeared.
Things are going crazy here.

1:18:49.463 --> 1:18:51.335
If Karim's resurfaced,

1:18:51.465 --> 1:18:54.120
it's only a matter of time
before he finds you.

1:18:54.251 --> 1:18:56.296
Someone on your end
must have tipped him off.

1:18:56.427 --> 1:18:58.124
But you've gotta tell me
where you are.

1:18:58.255 --> 1:18:59.343
Hey!

1:18:59.473 --> 1:19:01.519
Jack, are you there?

1:19:01.649 --> 1:19:03.564
I need to talk to you.

1:19:03.695 --> 1:19:04.696
Hey!

1:19:07.177 --> 1:19:08.656
Zaney!

1:19:12.138 --> 1:19:13.270
Zaney!

1:19:15.185 --> 1:19:16.577
Zaney!

1:19:26.022 --> 1:19:27.632
Zaney.

1:19:28.807 --> 1:19:29.808
Hey!

1:19:29.939 --> 1:19:31.854
Come here, you little prick!

1:19:31.984 --> 1:19:34.770
Mr. Leyton, what's going on?
What is this?

1:19:34.900 --> 1:19:36.641
Don't give me
that "Mr. Leyton" shit.

1:19:36.772 --> 1:19:37.816
You know who I am.

1:19:42.212 --> 1:19:45.084
I'm gonna kill Karim, but first,
I'll fucking kill you.

1:19:45.215 --> 1:19:46.694
Should've let Page
out of this, Zaney.

1:19:46.825 --> 1:19:48.435
[gun cocks]

1:19:48.566 --> 1:19:50.437
It's not me she's afraid of.
It's you.

1:19:50.568 --> 1:19:52.178
The fuck does that mean?

1:19:52.309 --> 1:19:56.052
Please, please, it's me,
Steinjo.

1:19:56.182 --> 1:19:57.793
Why are you doing this? Why?

1:20:09.630 --> 1:20:12.808
You're fucking psycho, Leyton!
What you trying to prove?

1:20:14.766 --> 1:20:16.681
You come to my bar every day
with that silly dog

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:18.291
and try to impress Angela.

1:20:18.422 --> 1:20:20.076
- But guess what.
- Aww...

1:20:20.206 --> 1:20:21.947
- Isn't he gorgeous?
- She.

1:20:22.078 --> 1:20:25.298
She only cares about the dog.
She just fucking likes the dog!

1:20:25.429 --> 1:20:26.865
I'm just...

1:20:26.996 --> 1:20:28.475
[mutters]

1:20:29.563 --> 1:20:31.261
Page, Steinjo...

1:20:31.391 --> 1:20:35.874
Zaney, Ronny, Page, Ronny...
[echoing]

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:42.402
ANGELA: Are you okay?
STEINJO: He's got a fucking gun!

1:20:42.533 --> 1:20:44.100
Oh, my God! What?

1:20:44.230 --> 1:20:45.753
Okay, go, go.

1:20:47.016 --> 1:20:49.366
JACK: This can't be happening.

1:20:49.496 --> 1:20:50.802
Page!

1:20:53.631 --> 1:20:56.025
Who is it, Page?

1:20:56.155 --> 1:20:58.505
Who's gonna hurt you?

1:20:58.636 --> 1:21:00.072
Page!

1:21:06.731 --> 1:21:07.950
Page!

1:21:10.082 --> 1:21:11.344
Page!

1:21:18.003 --> 1:21:19.222
Ronny?

1:21:58.783 --> 1:22:00.437
[cocks shotgun]

1:22:00.567 --> 1:22:02.569
Don't let him hurt me.

1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:05.485
[gunshot]

1:22:07.444 --> 1:22:08.749
KARIM: Where's my money, Jack?

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:10.229
I wanna see my wife first.

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:11.883
Just get it done and get out.

1:22:12.014 --> 1:22:13.537
Let's see the money first.

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:27.812
Don't let him hurt me.

1:22:27.943 --> 1:22:28.856
JACK: Ronny, move!

1:22:33.644 --> 1:22:35.254
[tires screeching]

1:22:58.669 --> 1:22:59.713
I killed her.

1:23:02.064 --> 1:23:03.065
She's dead.

1:23:06.024 --> 1:23:09.854
[horn honking]

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:11.029

ANNOUNCER: This is Buck,
laid off for Harry Page.

1:24:32.676 --> 1:24:34.982
Crosses Goode, Murdoch sweeps.

1:24:35.113 --> 1:24:37.115
Jack Stracken scores!

1:24:41.772 --> 1:24:44.079
ANNOUNCER:
Harry Page, Murdoch...

1:24:47.517 --> 1:24:49.606
FLEET: Jack.

1:24:49.736 --> 1:24:52.348
JACK: Fleet,
I remember everything.

1:24:52.478 --> 1:24:54.001
Where are you, Jack?

1:24:55.786 --> 1:24:58.093
Norway. Trondelag.

1:25:00.095 --> 1:25:02.358
Great.

1:25:02.488 --> 1:25:04.969
I'll send someone.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:45.401
FLEET: Jack?

1:25:48.578 --> 1:25:50.493
Jack, are you all right?

1:25:59.458 --> 1:26:01.330
Are your friends
coming to say hello?

1:26:01.460 --> 1:26:05.029
For fuck's sake, Jack,
it's me.

1:26:07.336 --> 1:26:09.555
Why don't you just
give the money back?

1:26:09.686 --> 1:26:11.731
Fuck! Don't blow this up!

1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:18.085

1:26:18.216 --> 1:26:20.131
[gunshots]

1:27:06.482 --> 1:27:08.484
I killed the decoy.

1:27:08.614 --> 1:27:10.529
Which means...

1:27:36.903 --> 1:27:38.383
[coughing]

1:27:38.514 --> 1:27:40.777
Come on out, Jack,
before you burn!

1:27:40.907 --> 1:27:42.779
Money's in here with me, Lane!

1:27:42.909 --> 1:27:44.868
Why don't you
come and get it?

1:27:44.998 --> 1:27:47.349
KARIM: It has never been
about the money, Jack!

1:27:47.479 --> 1:27:49.264
It's the principle!

1:27:52.484 --> 1:27:54.486
You think I don't know that,
you sick fuck?

1:27:56.183 --> 1:27:57.881
Second-rate player
steals your fucking queen,

1:27:58.011 --> 1:27:59.622
you just don't take it.

1:27:59.752 --> 1:28:02.538
KARIM: That queen came running
right back to me, Jack!

1:28:02.668 --> 1:28:03.930
Did she?

1:28:04.061 --> 1:28:06.019
You killed
an innocent girl, Jack.

1:28:06.150 --> 1:28:08.674
You set that whole thing up just
to see me suffer, didn't you?

1:28:08.805 --> 1:28:11.373
Keep telling yourself that
if that makes you--

1:29:26.317 --> 1:29:29.015

Nothing in life becomes so quiet
like the leaving of it.

1:31:54.770 --> 1:31:56.946

That's the look
I wanted to see in London.

fucking you

1:32:19.011 --> 1:32:20.883

my football club in return?

Veronique, I told myself
you were dead.

1:32:46.517 --> 1:32:51.304
And I told myself
that at least you were alive.

1:32:55.918 --> 1:32:57.876
I needed more, Jack.

1:33:08.495 --> 1:33:10.106

1:33:12.499 --> 1:33:14.937
Don't look at me like that.

You wouldn't take care of me,

1:33:17.069 --> 1:33:20.551

have killed me?

1:33:27.993 --> 1:33:31.170
You should have stayed hidden.

1:33:31.301 --> 1:33:33.651
And sending Grant
was a mistake.

1:33:33.782 --> 1:33:34.957
Yeah.

1:33:41.746 --> 1:33:45.576
So what do we do
