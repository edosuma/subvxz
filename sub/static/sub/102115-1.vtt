Come on, Emily.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.820
I know, Emily, I know.

02:04.950 --> 02:07.127
It's just impossible
to sleep here.

02:48.864 --> 02:51.171
[engine revving]

02:51.301 --> 02:54.043
Look, Jack, I know you love her.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.393
I don't wanna fucking hear
about it, Grant, all right?

03:04.836 --> 03:06.534
[line ringing]

03:06.664 --> 03:09.276

03:09.406 --> 03:10.886
MAN: Where's my money, Jack?

03:11.016 --> 03:12.627
I wanna see my wife first.

03:12.757 --> 03:13.802
[hangs up]

03:13.932 --> 03:14.890
Fuck.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.370
Don't play games with him.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.850
Just get it done and get out.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.156

Let's see the money first.

03:46.661 --> 03:47.749
[gun cocks]

04:01.719 --> 04:04.244
She starts walking,
then your man picks up the bag.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.472
All right, pick it up.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.044
Ronny, move.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.051
JACK: Ronny.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.358
GRANT: Something not right here.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.753
JACK: Ronny, move!

04:43.848 --> 04:46.721
JACK: Passed 1,000 days now.

04:46.851 --> 04:50.377
The memories of that night,
still fragments.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.770
Can't make much sense
of any of it.

04:55.425 --> 04:58.080
Veronique, Ronny.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.521
It's still so real.

05:04.652 --> 05:08.046
It's as if she possesses me.

05:08.177 --> 05:09.613
But Ronny is dead.

05:12.268 --> 05:14.879
There's no more now
than a constant echo.

05:16.272 --> 05:18.056
Like an imaginary companion.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.455
Come.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.637
Come on, Emily.

05:37.641 --> 05:39.426
Time stands still,

05:39.556 --> 05:42.080
and I find myself counting  the days stuck on this island.

05:56.834 --> 06:00.098
I've improvised
some kind of life out here,

06:00.229 --> 06:02.405
but she still haunts me.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.323
Could I have done more
to prevent her death?

06:07.454 --> 06:12.067
Can't move on till I can
put the pieces back together.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.331
[barking]

06:32.000 --> 06:32.914
[beep]

06:35.046 --> 06:38.180
WOMAN: Pawn to bishop four.
How's the weather?

06:38.310 --> 06:41.749
JACK: Fleet, my lawyer
in London

06:41.879 --> 06:44.099
and one remaining contact
with the outside world.

06:44.229 --> 06:47.450
She's desperate to know where
I am, but can I trust her?

06:47.581 --> 06:49.800
Can I trust anyone?

06:49.931 --> 06:52.194
It's warmer in Aus.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.109
JACK: Knight to bishop three.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.285
FLEET: It's not
your money, Jack.

07:13.998 --> 07:15.783
VERONIQUE:
Come back to me, Jack.

07:15.913 --> 07:20.091
Wherever we run,
he will always come for us.

07:20.222 --> 07:23.312
TV ANNOUNCER: He's gonna
be shadowed by Kosanovi.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.227
The two number eights
may be seeing

07:25.357 --> 07:27.098
quite a lot of each other.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.274
They had a real battle
in the league match

07:29.405 --> 07:31.451
earlier this season.

07:31.581 --> 07:35.803
Petroskov for Drayton,

07:35.933 --> 07:38.109
Murdoch's on the move,
and he's found him.

07:38.240 --> 07:41.286
This is Buck,
laid off for Harry Page.

07:41.417 --> 07:44.289
Crosses Goode, Murdoch sweeps. Stracken!

07:44.420 --> 07:45.900
Oh, yes!

07:46.030 --> 07:48.163
Jack Stracken scores!

07:48.293 --> 07:50.513
It was a career
cut cruelly short by injury.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.776
Jack Stracken was
never able to realize

07:52.907 --> 07:54.474
his full potential
as a player.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.693
His Cup final winner
for Drayton United,

07:56.824 --> 07:59.087
never forgotten,
but only a memory now.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.611
[phone buzzing]

08:02.743 --> 08:04.179
[sighs]

08:21.196 --> 08:23.590
Up, up, come here, come here.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.292
Hey, get off now.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.514
[ringing]

08:35.645 --> 08:36.777
Hello?

08:36.907 --> 08:38.605
It's me.

08:38.735 --> 08:41.564
It's 5:30
on a Sunday morning, Jack.

08:41.695 --> 08:42.826
I know.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.613
What time is it with you?

08:47.875 --> 08:49.529
What's the latest?

08:49.659 --> 08:52.619
Gosh, Jack, you've been away
three years now.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.621
They bought a new striker,

08:54.751 --> 08:56.753
got a few issues
with the stadium.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.625
They are still assigning Karim,

08:58.755 --> 09:00.757
but he's gotta surface
at some point.

09:00.888 --> 09:04.761
Look, there's nothing new
to report. Just lie low.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.676
I take it the money
is still safe.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.855
- Yeah.
- I can post a man with you.

09:11.986 --> 09:14.031
No, no, I'm fine.

09:14.162 --> 09:18.296
- But it's still all a blur?
- Yeah, I, um...

09:18.427 --> 09:20.081
I remember that smell.

09:20.211 --> 09:22.518
Yeah, well,
smell's the most vivid thing.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.042
Look, you know,
what he did to her,

09:25.173 --> 09:27.218
nothing you could have done
would have made any difference,

09:27.349 --> 09:28.785
money or no money.

09:28.916 --> 09:30.308
So you keep telling me,

09:30.439 --> 09:32.963
I just need to put the pieces
back together.

09:33.094 --> 09:36.358
I can't help you
if you don't trust me.

09:36.488 --> 09:39.187
For God's sake, Jack, you'd be
dead if I hadn't got you out.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.884
You're the only one
I can trust.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.974
So then tell me where you are
and let me help you.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.022
I'm not ready for that yet.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.722
It's not your money, Jack.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.421
JACK: We'd been happy once.

09:56.552 --> 09:58.685
Seems like a lifetime ago.

09:58.815 --> 10:00.687
Almost there.

10:04.212 --> 10:06.606
- Just a couple more.
- It's cold.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.434
[camera clicking]

10:09.565 --> 10:11.741
[speaking French]

10:16.616 --> 10:18.835
Just because I'm French.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.666
That's sweet.
[giggles]

10:23.797 --> 10:24.798
Do you miss it?

10:24.928 --> 10:26.364
Football?

10:26.495 --> 10:27.757
Yes.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.716
I miss scoring.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.414
It's a great feeling.

10:32.544 --> 10:34.155
Better than sex?

10:34.285 --> 10:36.940
No comment.
[chuckles]

10:38.855 --> 10:40.988
But there are other ways
to play the game.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.250
Like what?

10:42.380 --> 10:45.383
Manager, CEO, chairman.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.647
Are you serious?

10:49.300 --> 10:52.129
You're talking about
owning the club.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.655
Is that possible?

10:55.785 --> 10:57.569
Anything's possible.

11:01.748 --> 11:04.402
What about us?

11:04.533 --> 11:07.318
This is all about us, Ronny.

11:07.449 --> 11:10.234
We can roll the dice,
buy a big stake in the club,

11:10.365 --> 11:12.976
climb as high as we can
for a few years,

11:13.107 --> 11:18.155
then we sell out, buy a little
winery in Australia.

11:18.286 --> 11:19.896
Nah.

11:21.550 --> 11:25.597
Penthouses, luxury yachts,
champagne.

11:25.728 --> 11:28.165
Who wouldn't want
a life like that?

11:29.906 --> 11:31.734
Jack Stracken.

12:30.488 --> 12:31.968
[whines]

12:36.538 --> 12:37.931
Are you sure, Mr. Leyton?

12:38.061 --> 12:40.847
Oh, yeah.
In a tall glass.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.197
- What's your story?
- One more, please.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.590
Another one, please.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.679
I'll have another one.

12:47.810 --> 12:49.203
And I'll have another one.

12:49.333 --> 12:50.378
WOMAN: Where are you from,
Angela?

12:50.508 --> 12:51.945
ANGELA: I'm from Dublin.

12:58.342 --> 12:59.735
MAN: Angela.
ANGELA: Hey, senor.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.651
Good news.
So you're hired. Welcome.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.305
- Great.
- Can you start tonight?

13:04.435 --> 13:06.916
- Sure.
- All right, good.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.617
Come on, Emily.

13:17.013 --> 13:19.276
Oh, isn't he gorgeous?

13:19.407 --> 13:20.669
- She.
- Aww.

What's her name?

13:22.497 --> 13:24.586
VERONIQUE:
Drink to remember, Jack.

13:37.860 --> 13:40.297
Are you having fun,
Mr. Leyton?

13:40.428 --> 13:42.212
Yeah, yes, Steinjo, whatever.

13:42.343 --> 13:43.648
Okay.

13:52.570 --> 13:53.484

VERONIQUE:
Drink to remember, Jack.

15:47.163 --> 15:49.861
JACK: I need a change
of atmosphere.

15:49.992 --> 15:53.300
Can't get back those ten years.

15:53.430 --> 15:55.955
I have a vision.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.435
A bar on a lake,

15:58.566 --> 16:00.960
drawing me to it
like a magnet.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.789
I feel like I know this place.

16:28.509 --> 16:30.380
The usual, Mr. Leyton?

16:30.511 --> 16:33.644
- And one for yourself, Tom.
- Thank you very much.

16:34.906 --> 16:36.343
What's all this?

16:36.473 --> 16:39.215
TOM: Zaney's big new draw
for the punters.

16:39.346 --> 16:42.001
- Music and footie.
- You fancy a game?

16:42.131 --> 16:44.264
I would, but Zaney
don't like me playing.

16:44.394 --> 16:45.352
Fair enough.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.144
MAN: Hey.

16:56.276 --> 16:57.929
Yeah, yeah.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.064
- It's a hundred quid.
- You said fifty.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.849
It's a hundred quid.
Take it or leave it.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.026
Is she cool with that?

17:11.769 --> 17:12.727
Hey, Tom.

17:12.857 --> 17:13.989
How's it going, Zaney?

17:14.120 --> 17:16.470
- Good, good. And you?
- Not bad.

17:24.217 --> 17:25.957
What was going on out there?

17:26.088 --> 17:28.960
Just business, Mr. Leyton.
I'm sure you understand.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.356
Fancy a hiding?

17:41.190 --> 17:43.236
All right, ready?

17:47.805 --> 17:49.981
Dropping by
for the show tonight?

17:50.112 --> 17:51.157
Show? What show?

17:51.287 --> 17:53.159
Show. You know the show.

17:53.289 --> 17:54.377
Oh, yeah, yeah, the show.

17:54.508 --> 17:55.857
Come on, come on!

17:58.816 --> 18:00.905
- Zaney.
- Yeah.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.994
I meant to ask. Where'd you get
that name of yours?

18:03.125 --> 18:06.563
School. Girls reckoned
I looked like

18:06.694 --> 18:08.783
that actor in Titanic,
Billy Zane.

18:08.913 --> 18:10.785
- Can't see it.
- Guess it stuck.

18:10.915 --> 18:14.267
Yes! One-nil.
Going for the kill.

18:20.316 --> 18:21.709
Excuse us a minute.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.365
Hey.

18:25.495 --> 18:27.062
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.498
I was just
looking for something.

18:28.629 --> 18:30.761
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.594
- Who's the girl?
- She's here for the holidays.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.380
You know, extra cash,
bar work.

18:40.510 --> 18:42.686
And I got her singing.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.471
Great voice.

18:44.601 --> 18:45.820
Just singing?

18:45.950 --> 18:47.822
Or is she a business too?

18:47.952 --> 18:49.215
What do you take me for,
Mr. Leyton?

18:49.345 --> 18:50.781
WOMAN:
I've got a name, you know.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.225
ZANEY: Mr. Leyton, Page Murdoch.

18:59.355 --> 19:01.923
Page. Nice name.

19:04.055 --> 19:06.536
Aren't you gonna offer
your star-turn a drink?

19:06.667 --> 19:07.972
Sorry.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.887
Vodka with ice and lemon.

19:10.018 --> 19:12.151
ZANEY: You should hear her.
PAGE: Don't forget the lemon.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.327
ZANEY: Shakespeare Sisters,
remember them?

19:14.457 --> 19:15.980
JACK: I know her
from somewhere,

19:16.111 --> 19:17.243
I'm sure we've met before.

19:17.373 --> 19:18.896
If you want me
to set you up...

19:19.027 --> 19:21.247
You're not pimping
her out, Zaney.

19:21.377 --> 19:23.118
Hey!

19:23.249 --> 19:24.685
You understand?

Not much of a guard dog,

23:27.841 --> 23:29.408
How did you know I lived here?

23:29.538 --> 23:31.192
Zaney told me.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.978
Why would he tell you that?

23:35.109 --> 23:36.589
I suppose he felt guilty

23:36.719 --> 23:40.767
after your little intervention
this afternoon.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.030
Very chivalrous, by the away.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.513
I wanted to say thanks.

Are you gonna get me a drink?

How did you get over

Boat.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.855
I didn't see it.

24:31.295 --> 24:34.081
It's not safe to travel

24:34.211 --> 24:36.083
What difference does it make?

Night, day,
it's all the same here.

It's a big lake.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.720
One thing
I've noticed about you.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.595
You drink every drink...

25:11.205 --> 25:14.077
as if it's going to be
your last.

25:15.862 --> 25:18.647
Zaney says
you're into real estate.

25:18.778 --> 25:21.694
Is that right?

25:21.824 --> 25:24.348
Says you're sitting
on a fortune.

25:24.479 --> 25:26.525
Some kind of tax dodge.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.833
What else does he say?

How did you end up

I like it. It's quiet.

Don't you feel the world
is standing still here,

25:42.976 --> 25:45.892

Guess, Jack.

She died.

26:15.922 --> 26:19.926
Why didn't you go to Australia?

26:20.056 --> 26:22.581
Why didn't you
build Jack's Domain?

26:22.711 --> 26:25.279
Force her to go with you?
[echoing]

26:27.150 --> 26:29.283
'Cause you are not
strong enough.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.459
You lied about protecting her.

You broke the contract,

26:33.200 --> 26:35.550
You let her die.

27:13.153 --> 27:16.939
Where else can we
get the money then?

27:17.070 --> 27:18.985
There will be strings.

27:19.115 --> 27:21.378
There are always strings.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.294
Look.

27:26.732 --> 27:29.473
We get the 10 million,

27:29.604 --> 27:32.825
we build the new stadium,

27:32.955 --> 27:34.914
development deal.

27:40.223 --> 27:44.445
We pay him back,
and we never see his face again.

27:44.575 --> 27:45.925
Okay?

27:49.363 --> 27:50.712
Okay.

28:03.377 --> 28:04.770
To ask him about the money.

28:04.900 --> 28:07.033
You want to do it?

28:07.163 --> 28:09.426
I don't see what other
choice we've got.

28:10.950 --> 28:14.388
Okay, but why now?

28:14.518 --> 28:16.782
We could see him anytime.

28:16.912 --> 28:18.784
If I'm gonna borrow money
from someone,

28:18.914 --> 28:21.787
I want to understand
who they are.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.092
He'll be there, right?

28:23.223 --> 28:25.225
Sure. It's his club.

28:29.011 --> 28:30.926
That's where you met him,
isn't it?

28:32.841 --> 28:34.713
You know it is.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.889
Why do you wanna see it?
There'll be--

28:37.019 --> 28:39.021
I know what kind of club
it is.

28:42.633 --> 28:45.593
In a place like that,
you'll have to participate.

28:45.724 --> 28:48.248
I'm cool with it.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.337

Oh!

29:41.692 --> 29:44.043
What an honor this is.

29:44.173 --> 29:48.830
The great Jack Stracken
wants to borrow money from me

29:48.961 --> 29:51.920
to buy into his
old football club.

29:52.051 --> 29:55.358
You know, I'm a big fan
of you and your wife,

29:55.489 --> 29:59.101
about the good memory
of seeing her performing again,

29:59.232 --> 30:01.277
like your goal
in the Cup final.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.758
You always had the knack
for being in the right place

30:03.889 --> 30:05.368
at the right time.

30:05.499 --> 30:07.501

You're proposing
I lend against your stake

30:10.983 --> 30:13.507
in the new stadium.

30:13.637 --> 30:17.859
Share price rises,
you cash in and pay me back.

30:17.990 --> 30:21.558
I like it.
You are a shrewd man, Jack.

30:21.689 --> 30:22.821

30:22.951 --> 30:24.779
50% interest.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.041
JACK: No shit.

30:26.172 --> 30:28.696
It's my usual term.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.438
I'm sure a man
of your means and stature

30:31.568 --> 30:34.180
wouldn't expect anything less.

30:36.008 --> 30:39.446
These terms are not negotiable.

30:39.576 --> 30:41.361
JACK: We invested Karim's money in the football club

30:41.491 --> 30:43.537
as a new stadium was built.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.496
The share price soon went up.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.457
Do you like it?

30:50.587 --> 30:52.459
JACK: I'd never seen
Ronny so happy.

30:52.589 --> 30:53.677
We were killing it.

30:58.682 --> 31:00.510
JACK: I thought maybe
we should cash in,

31:00.641 --> 31:02.599
but Ronny always got her way.

31:02.730 --> 31:05.254
We agreed to build
this club together.

31:05.385 --> 31:07.561
You said you'd
go through with it,

31:07.691 --> 31:09.737
but now you're backing down.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.957
Please, a few more years.

31:12.087 --> 31:15.003
You always said Premier League
is the Holy Grail,

31:15.134 --> 31:18.920
then you can have as many
Jack's Domains as you want.

Oh, your luck's changing then.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.395
This is serious, Fleet.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.528
She know me how?

32:01.658 --> 32:04.618
What, do you need protection
from this girl?

32:04.748 --> 32:07.490
She's taken a picture.

32:07.621 --> 32:09.362
What picture?

32:09.492 --> 32:10.667
Oh, shit, the gun.

32:10.798 --> 32:11.712
What?

32:11.842 --> 32:14.236
The gun. Fuck!

32:14.367 --> 32:16.238
What the hell is
going on there, Jack?

32:17.892 --> 32:19.285
Calm down.

32:19.415 --> 32:20.939
You probably scared
the poor girl.

32:24.159 --> 32:26.074
I don't know
if Karim sent her.

32:26.205 --> 32:27.684
If Karim sent her,
you'd one dead fuck right now.

32:27.815 --> 32:29.382

- Oh, come on, Jack.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.514
You're being paranoid.

32:31.645 --> 32:35.083
But I know
I've seen her before.

32:35.214 --> 32:37.607
Look, Fleet, I need
to ask you something.

32:37.738 --> 32:39.305
It's about Ronny's death.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.138
Was it my fault?

32:47.661 --> 32:49.880
You didn't kill her, did you?
He did.

32:50.011 --> 32:52.579
You get some rest.
You sound awful.

33:08.769 --> 33:11.380
Possibly, but for what?

33:13.121 --> 33:16.124
Did Ronny have a sister?
Maybe it's her.

33:18.039 --> 33:19.693
Blackmail?

33:19.823 --> 33:22.696
She knows about the money,
wants a piece of it.

33:26.091 --> 33:28.397
Did Karim send her?

33:28.528 --> 33:31.052
The bastard

37:19.280 --> 37:20.934
Councilor Lane.

37:21.064 --> 37:24.067
Ah, pleased to meet the one and
only Jack Stracken at last.

37:24.198 --> 37:25.765
I was just saying to Veronique

37:25.895 --> 37:28.376
what a fantastic development
you've made.

37:28.507 --> 37:30.465
Which is going to propel
Drayton United

37:30.596 --> 37:31.597
into the Prime League.

37:31.727 --> 37:32.989
I'll drink to that.

37:33.120 --> 37:36.079
Everyone, to the new stadium.

37:36.210 --> 37:37.646
ALL: New stadium!

37:37.777 --> 37:38.865
Cheers.

37:40.823 --> 37:42.129
Excuse me.

37:49.658 --> 37:50.703
Jack.

37:53.096 --> 37:55.490
You have gone quiet on me.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.492
I need more time.

38:00.016 --> 38:01.627
Ten days.

38:01.757 --> 38:04.064
And that's more than generous.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.589
Don't bite the hand, Jack.

38:18.731 --> 38:21.516
Uh, need a word.
Can't wait.

38:22.865 --> 38:24.911
Yeah.

38:25.041 --> 38:26.391
Stadium payments,
player contracts,

38:26.521 --> 38:27.696
developers, agents' fees.

38:27.827 --> 38:29.437
I've been through
all the figures.

38:29.568 --> 38:31.004
They just don't add up.

38:31.134 --> 38:32.919
What doesn't add up?

38:33.049 --> 38:34.399
Give us a minute, mate.

38:34.529 --> 38:35.617
Sure.

38:39.012 --> 38:40.796
Someone's stealing from us.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.321
And Karim wants his loan back.

38:43.451 --> 38:44.757
What did he say?

38:44.887 --> 38:47.281
What do you fucking think, Jack?

38:47.412 --> 38:49.109
[crowd chatter]

38:52.025 --> 38:54.462
- You--
- Shut up.

38:54.593 --> 38:55.985
Just do your job.

39:07.388 --> 39:08.346
Fuck.

39:11.827 --> 39:13.916
It's the transfer fees.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.440
How's that possible?

39:15.570 --> 39:18.399
20 million skimmed off
the transfer fees.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.054
Come on, Jack.
It's nothing at this level.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.143
He doesn't care about
the money.

39:23.273 --> 39:24.362
This is his game.

39:24.492 --> 39:27.147
- Karim?
- Yeah.

39:27.277 --> 39:29.454
Are you saying he'd bankrupt
the club intentionally?

39:29.584 --> 39:30.933
He'd lose his stake.
It doesn't make any sense.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.066
You don't know him
like I do.

39:33.196 --> 39:35.851
- I gonna fucking talk to him.
- Talk about what?

39:35.982 --> 39:37.418
We can't prove anything.

39:37.549 --> 39:38.985
He's too fucking smart.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.901
Someone is working for him.

39:42.031 --> 39:43.511
Someone here.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.034
Who?

39:45.165 --> 39:46.601
Benny?

39:46.732 --> 39:49.517
No. No fucking way.

39:49.648 --> 39:51.824
Benny's the one
who brought this to us.

39:51.954 --> 39:54.870
Okay, let's start with
the agents then.

39:56.481 --> 40:00.180
It's going to get nasty, Jack.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.835
Are you okay with that?

40:04.097 --> 40:05.751
JACK: Where's Page?

40:05.881 --> 40:07.883
ZANEY: Back home, I guess.

40:08.014 --> 40:09.189
And where's that?

40:09.319 --> 40:10.625
You're a sly one,
Mr. Leyton.

40:10.756 --> 40:13.759
I'm not pissing around, Zaney!

40:13.889 --> 40:15.891

40:23.159 --> 40:25.074
FLEET: When was last time
Ronny was in the news?

40:25.205 --> 40:27.120
Years ago when she was died.

40:27.250 --> 40:30.558
Exactly. But I'll check it out
if it'll make you happy, Jack.

40:30.689 --> 40:33.300
What does she
call herself then?

40:33.431 --> 40:35.128
Her name's Page,

40:35.258 --> 40:37.783

Do it now.

41:02.764 --> 41:05.332
Then I'll forgive you.

to people like you?

41:47.113 --> 41:48.027
Of course I did.

You should be thanking me,

42:12.181 --> 42:15.141
I need a word.
It can't wait.

JACK: Need a word.

44:58.173 --> 44:59.697
It's been a long time, mate.

I wouldn't be calling
if it wasn't important.

I don't know what you're
talking about, mate.

Look, Jack,
I know you love her.

45:08.836 --> 45:11.230
I don't wanna fucking hear
about it, Grant, all right?

45:11.360 --> 45:13.841
I need you to sniff around

45:13.972 --> 45:15.843
see if there's any record
of a Page Murdoch.

45:15.974 --> 45:18.541
- Who?
- French girl, auburn hair.

45:18.672 --> 45:19.760
French girl.

45:19.891 --> 45:22.328
I know. She's got eyes on us.

45:22.458 --> 45:24.330
Check it out. Go right back
to before I went away.

45:24.460 --> 45:26.201
Look, mate,
I never wanna go back there.

who this girl is.

Maybe some connection
with Karim.

45:41.608 --> 45:44.176

You know the one.

Well, look, mate, what--

45:47.570 --> 45:50.486
Why don't you just talk
to Fleet, straight up?

I can trust.

it's been awhile.

46:35.270 --> 46:38.796
So you've been running things
in Mr. Stracken's absence.

46:38.926 --> 46:40.275
We have an agreement.

46:40.406 --> 46:42.800
Until he deems it safe
to come home.

46:42.930 --> 46:44.627
I just wish we knew
where he was.

46:44.758 --> 46:47.587
We'd be far more helpful to him.

46:47.717 --> 46:50.155
How does he seem to you?

46:50.285 --> 46:52.853
He's been a bit...

46:52.984 --> 46:54.899
erratic on the phone.

46:55.029 --> 46:58.163
I know about
as much as you do.

47:02.123 --> 47:03.777
Mm. In your phone call,

47:03.908 --> 47:05.735
you mentioned something
about a girl?

Yes.

Yeah, I forgot you used
to be on the force.

ring any bells.

the big time, haven't you?

47:30.717 --> 47:32.414

47:32.545 --> 47:34.025

of any more help,

I do have rather a lot on.

You really want to have this
conversation in front of Zaney?

52:07.689 --> 52:09.387
Is this about the money?
Is that what you want?

52:09.517 --> 52:11.606
I want you to have a drink.

52:11.737 --> 52:13.391
My wife's coat, her lipstick,
her perfume,

52:13.521 --> 52:15.871
- even her fucking accent!
- You're hurting me!

52:16.002 --> 52:18.047
You tell me what's going on,
or I'll really fucking hurt you.

52:18.178 --> 52:19.571
Then you won't know
what happened.

52:19.701 --> 52:21.573
You won't know what you did.

52:22.704 --> 52:24.141
I know you loved her too.

52:44.552 --> 52:47.468
[moaning]

53:09.925 --> 53:12.450
Did Karim send you?
You have to tell me.

53:12.580 --> 53:14.234
[laughs]

53:14.365 --> 53:16.584
If he had, you'd be dead.

53:16.715 --> 53:18.586
So what do you want?
Just tell me what you want!

53:18.717 --> 53:20.588
I just want you to remember!

53:22.503 --> 53:24.375
I don't wanna remember.

53:24.505 --> 53:26.203
I don't wanna remember!

53:26.333 --> 53:29.206
So I just pull this trigger,
and it ends!

53:30.946 --> 53:33.471
But will it, Jack?

53:33.601 --> 53:34.646
Will it?

53:49.574 --> 53:53.230
Come and see me sing tonight.
I know you like to watch.

54:01.455 --> 54:04.328
JACK: Karim was stealing
from the club.

54:04.458 --> 54:07.156
Way more than the 10 million
we owed him.

54:09.202 --> 54:11.204
But we needed evidence.

54:16.731 --> 54:18.429
It's an old-school method,
Darren.

54:19.821 --> 54:22.084
Nothing high-tech, you know.

54:22.215 --> 54:24.217
You'll scream,

54:24.348 --> 54:26.045
a bit of begging,

54:26.175 --> 54:28.265
then you'll tell Mr. Stracken
over there

54:28.395 --> 54:30.832
everything he wants to know.

54:32.007 --> 54:35.446
Oh, no, no, no, no pressure.

54:35.576 --> 54:38.797
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we...

54:38.927 --> 54:41.930
A few practice go's first,
yeah?

54:42.061 --> 54:44.585
Get you up to speed.

54:44.716 --> 54:46.587
He's ripping us off.

54:47.980 --> 54:49.373
I'm just an agent.

54:49.503 --> 54:52.027
It's Karim, isn't it?

54:57.076 --> 54:59.687
It's funny, Darren.

54:59.818 --> 55:02.429
Calm down, calm down.

55:02.560 --> 55:04.997
That's it.
[laughs]

55:05.127 --> 55:07.521
Nothing to worry about, mate.

55:07.652 --> 55:10.307
[screams]

55:10.437 --> 55:12.700
[vomits]

55:12.831 --> 55:15.050
Nothing to worry about at all.

55:15.181 --> 55:17.705
[whispers]
Never show your weakness.

55:43.775 --> 55:45.516
Close your eyes.

55:51.696 --> 55:53.132
Nothing to worry about,
all right?

55:53.262 --> 55:54.220
JACK: Turn it off.

55:54.351 --> 55:56.875
Watch it.

55:57.005 --> 55:59.747
- Please.
- I want you to watch it.

56:00.879 --> 56:03.708
[screaming]

56:06.711 --> 56:08.147
[rewinding]

56:08.277 --> 56:09.540
VERONIQUE: You're no use to me.

56:09.670 --> 56:12.543
Go to your Australia,
whatever.

56:12.673 --> 56:14.414
Honey, I love you.

56:14.545 --> 56:17.112
I love you too.

56:17.243 --> 56:19.898
But this is not about love.

56:28.210 --> 56:31.779
[bell tolling]

56:42.007 --> 56:44.052
You wanted information
about the stadium deal.

56:44.183 --> 56:45.271
You know I do.

56:45.402 --> 56:46.359
Yeah.

56:46.490 --> 56:50.232
Yeah, so what's it worth?

56:50.363 --> 56:52.583
Oh, come on, Jack.
I'm on your side. You know I am.

56:52.713 --> 56:54.149
Come on, I was the one
who secured the votes.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.586
I paid everyone off, all right?

56:55.716 --> 56:57.414
And then all that stuff
with the council.

56:59.677 --> 57:01.940
I know who's doing
the stealing for Karim.

57:06.466 --> 57:07.467
Beaumont.

57:10.427 --> 57:11.819
Speak to him.

57:16.955 --> 57:19.131
[sobbing]

57:21.699 --> 57:23.048
He said--

57:23.178 --> 57:26.051
No, Benny,
you fucking listen to me.

57:28.575 --> 57:31.186
How long you been
working for him?

57:33.014 --> 57:34.929
I don't know what you're
talking about, Jack.

57:35.060 --> 57:37.236
It's me, Benny!

57:37.366 --> 57:40.195
Please, please.

57:40.326 --> 57:43.634
You'd have your share,
if you'd just been smart enough.

57:43.764 --> 57:47.507
If you hung on
just a little bit longer.

57:47.638 --> 57:51.511
But you always were
a selfish little prick.

57:51.642 --> 57:53.382
Oh, Christ, please.

57:53.513 --> 57:57.038
I'm the one that told you
about the missing money.

57:57.169 --> 58:00.346
I know you too well, Benny.

58:00.477 --> 58:03.262
You did the deal, and when you
got greedy, you asked for more.

58:03.392 --> 58:05.960
Karim said no,
and you bottled it.

58:06.091 --> 58:10.182
[sobbing]

58:10.312 --> 58:12.750
- [crack]
- [crying]

58:15.100 --> 58:16.623
[screams]

58:18.146 --> 58:20.497
[crying continues]

58:24.457 --> 58:25.458
Plug it in.

58:26.807 --> 58:27.939
What?

58:28.069 --> 58:29.680
I said fucking
plug it in, Grant.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.475
JACK: It's all coming back now.

58:42.606 --> 58:44.782
But if Karim knows
where I am, why send her?

58:44.912 --> 58:46.435
[coughing]

59:05.411 --> 59:08.327
VERONIQUE: He will find us
wherever we go.

59:08.457 --> 59:10.982
He will crush us!

59:11.112 --> 59:13.375
[speaking French]

59:23.385 --> 59:24.822
[phone ringing]

59:26.867 --> 59:28.739
Yeah.

59:28.869 --> 59:31.219
So I've been doing some digging,
and I've got some info for you.

59:31.350 --> 59:33.308
Okay, go on.

59:33.439 --> 59:36.442
Not on the phone, Mr. Grant.

59:36.573 --> 59:38.183
Okay, then where?

59:40.359 --> 59:41.403
Okay, shoot.

59:47.540 --> 59:48.802
[coughs]

1:00:17.570 --> 1:00:18.615
Hello?

1:00:34.108 --> 1:00:35.109
Why her?

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:03.050
FLEET: Oh, God. All this again?JACK: Did I kill Ronny?

1:01:03.181 --> 1:01:04.530
I don't know, Jack.
I wasn't there.

1:01:04.661 --> 1:01:06.967
But you read
the police report, right?

1:01:07.098 --> 1:01:09.578
I can't remember the details.

1:01:09.709 --> 1:01:12.451
What was the gun?
Was it a Remington?

1:01:12.581 --> 1:01:14.845
Was she shot in the front
or the back?

1:01:14.975 --> 1:01:17.891
I don't know
what gun it was, but...

1:01:18.022 --> 1:01:20.328
[sighs]

1:01:20.459 --> 1:01:22.417
Jack, Ronny was shot
in the front.

1:01:22.548 --> 1:01:24.898
- That means I killed her.
- Don't say that, Jack.

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:26.291
Yes, I did.

1:01:26.421 --> 1:01:29.424
No, okay, well, maybe...

1:01:29.555 --> 1:01:32.210
- You knew and never told me.
- Jack...

1:01:32.340 --> 1:01:33.820
You let me believe
he killed her.

1:01:33.951 --> 1:01:35.692
God, you want to have
all the pressure.

1:01:35.822 --> 1:01:38.172
-Why would you do that for me? -You were aiming at him, right?

1:01:38.303 --> 1:01:40.305
Maybe your finger slipped.

1:01:40.435 --> 1:01:42.481
Maybe it...

1:01:42.611 --> 1:01:44.004
it was easier.

1:01:44.135 --> 1:01:46.006
Easier for who?

1:01:46.137 --> 1:01:49.923
Easier for me to trust you,
to tell you where I was.

1:01:50.054 --> 1:01:53.231
Okay, hang on.
You don't know that, Jack.

1:02:20.171 --> 1:02:22.129
What are you doing here, Tom?

1:02:26.133 --> 1:02:28.875
I'm hunting.

1:02:29.006 --> 1:02:31.356
What are you doing?

1:02:31.486 --> 1:02:34.185
This is my cabin.

1:02:34.315 --> 1:02:37.579
You are hunting too,
Mr. Leyton?

1:02:40.757 --> 1:02:43.977
That's not a gun
for killing rabbits.

1:02:46.632 --> 1:02:48.677
Hunt somewhere else, Tom.

1:02:49.809 --> 1:02:52.812
Wherever you say, Mr. Leyton.

1:03:07.218 --> 1:03:08.610
FLEET: So I've been doing
some digging,

1:03:08.741 --> 1:03:10.482
and I've got some info for you.

1:03:10.612 --> 1:03:13.920
Upper Nation A13,
back entrance.

1:03:47.127 --> 1:03:50.739
Grant, my friend.

1:03:50.870 --> 1:03:53.786
Jack, where is he?

1:03:53.917 --> 1:03:55.701
I don't know.

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:58.051
[laughing]

1:03:59.748 --> 1:04:01.576
You know...

1:04:01.707 --> 1:04:06.668
we made a deal to spare Jack,

1:04:06.799 --> 1:04:11.717
then he goes
and takes my money.

1:04:14.198 --> 1:04:16.896
What do you mean, we?

1:04:19.333 --> 1:04:20.639
[groans]

1:04:39.092 --> 1:04:40.311
[crying]

1:04:40.441 --> 1:04:43.140
Please, guys!

1:04:43.270 --> 1:04:46.099
As soon as you came running,
Karim knew we were onto him.

1:04:46.230 --> 1:04:48.058
It's no fucking mystery, Benny.

1:04:48.188 --> 1:04:50.277
It's not what you think, Jack.

1:04:50.408 --> 1:04:52.453
How's he moving the cash?

1:04:52.584 --> 1:04:54.542
I want names,
account numbers, passwords

1:04:54.673 --> 1:04:57.197
on fucking everything.

1:04:58.982 --> 1:05:01.680
Please! Please!

1:05:03.290 --> 1:05:04.378
[crack]

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:08.078
[groaning]

1:05:08.208 --> 1:05:10.776
Christ, please.

1:05:10.907 --> 1:05:12.343
Please.

1:05:14.606 --> 1:05:16.651
Last chance, Benny.

1:05:19.567 --> 1:05:22.788
He's a scared pussy.
A pussy.

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:25.399
He's lucky to be paid.

1:05:25.530 --> 1:05:28.359
Like he wanted you
to find another...

1:05:28.489 --> 1:05:31.231
He's just a little fucking...

1:05:31.362 --> 1:05:33.320
I could tell him myself.

1:05:33.451 --> 1:05:37.281
[laughs]

1:05:37.411 --> 1:05:38.760
I think he wants some more.

1:05:43.156 --> 1:05:45.506
[cries]

1:05:50.816 --> 1:05:52.383
Well?

1:05:52.513 --> 1:05:55.255
It should have been me, Jack.

1:05:55.386 --> 1:05:57.257
I was always
a better fucking player

1:05:57.388 --> 1:05:59.390
than you ever fucking were.

1:05:59.520 --> 1:06:01.609
[laughing]

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:09.226
You're a sad little man, Benny.
You always were.

1:06:10.618 --> 1:06:12.794
BENNY: I'm fucking sad?

1:06:12.925 --> 1:06:15.188
The club's going down
like the fucking Titanic,

1:06:15.319 --> 1:06:17.234
and you're calling me sad?

1:06:17.364 --> 1:06:20.106
[laughs]
You could never run anything

1:06:20.237 --> 1:06:22.674
without me wiping
your fucking ass!

1:06:22.804 --> 1:06:27.461
Can't you see
you're a fucking joke, Jack?

1:06:27.592 --> 1:06:29.072
Great.

1:06:29.202 --> 1:06:34.947
Everyone, we're all fucking
your whore wife!

1:06:35.078 --> 1:06:37.341
[Benny laughing]

1:06:37.471 --> 1:06:39.952
[zapping]

1:06:46.306 --> 1:06:47.829
Shut the fuck up!

1:06:52.051 --> 1:06:53.574
Honey, it's done.

1:06:53.705 --> 1:06:55.663
It's done.

1:06:55.794 --> 1:06:58.405
Are you fucking stupid?

1:06:58.536 --> 1:07:00.886
You know what he did to me!

1:07:01.017 --> 1:07:03.715
You think we can
run away from this?

1:07:03.845 --> 1:07:07.849
He will find us
wherever we go.

1:07:07.980 --> 1:07:10.156
He will crush us.

1:07:10.287 --> 1:07:12.593
You do nothing.

1:07:12.724 --> 1:07:15.466
You might as well
kill me yourself!

1:07:16.945 --> 1:07:19.209
[speaking French]

1:07:41.492 --> 1:07:43.711
What did he do to you?

1:07:43.842 --> 1:07:45.409
Karim.

1:07:49.456 --> 1:07:51.763
He hurt me.

1:07:51.893 --> 1:07:54.070
What does that mean?

1:07:57.334 --> 1:07:58.291
Hey.

1:07:59.858 --> 1:08:01.729
In every way.

1:08:03.514 --> 1:08:06.082
Why didn't you just leave?

1:08:06.212 --> 1:08:08.780
Because I got to like it.

1:08:11.130 --> 1:08:14.307
I'm here because of him.

1:08:14.438 --> 1:08:16.222
This ends now.

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:20.531
It ends when he's dead.

1:08:28.539 --> 1:08:29.801
No.

1:08:35.807 --> 1:08:37.069
Jack?

1:08:42.509 --> 1:08:46.600
â™ª [disco]

1:08:54.434 --> 1:08:57.916
â™ª [continues]

1:09:04.270 --> 1:09:05.445
[door opens]

1:09:07.708 --> 1:09:08.709
Vee.

1:09:10.450 --> 1:09:11.408
Ah.

1:09:13.671 --> 1:09:17.414
Still as beautiful
and charming

1:09:17.544 --> 1:09:21.548
as the day I plucked you
out of that Paris ghetto.

1:09:21.679 --> 1:09:24.334
I gave you a new life.

1:09:24.464 --> 1:09:26.814
Surround yourself
with books, Karim.

1:09:26.945 --> 1:09:28.294
It won't mask anything.

1:09:31.036 --> 1:09:34.692
Ah, Vee, what do you want?

1:09:34.822 --> 1:09:37.042
Are you leaving
that loser of husband

1:09:37.173 --> 1:09:39.740
who still owes me
so much money?

1:09:39.871 --> 1:09:41.133
Jack can't pay you.

1:09:42.613 --> 1:09:44.528
I see.

1:09:44.658 --> 1:09:47.095
Poor Jack.

1:09:47.226 --> 1:09:51.622
Your nightclubs
are bleeding you dry.

1:09:51.752 --> 1:09:54.407
We know you're stealing
from the football club.

1:09:56.104 --> 1:09:57.889
I'll get you your money.

1:09:58.019 --> 1:10:01.153
Jack leaves
and never comes back.

1:10:01.284 --> 1:10:04.243
And how are you
going to do that?

1:10:09.770 --> 1:10:11.729
[sighs]

1:10:11.859 --> 1:10:13.905
She's too much for you.

1:10:14.035 --> 1:10:18.126
A street girl
from Saint-Lunaire.

1:10:18.257 --> 1:10:20.825
A fighter struggling, huh?

1:10:20.955 --> 1:10:24.524
You think a girl like that
just gonna settle down for you?

1:10:24.655 --> 1:10:26.265
You can't cage her.

1:10:26.396 --> 1:10:29.137
You don't love her.
You fucking cut her.

1:10:29.268 --> 1:10:30.835
[chuckles]

1:10:30.965 --> 1:10:32.837
Is that what she told you?

1:10:32.967 --> 1:10:36.623
She begs me to hurt her
every time we fucked,

1:10:36.754 --> 1:10:39.931
and whatever I do,
it's never enough.

1:10:53.292 --> 1:10:54.946
[whimpering]

1:10:55.076 --> 1:10:57.818
We convince him
you're going to kill me.

1:10:57.949 --> 1:10:58.993
[chuckles]

1:10:59.124 --> 1:11:00.343
[Veronique screaming]

1:11:00.473 --> 1:11:01.779
What do you want?

1:11:01.909 --> 1:11:04.695
10 million, cash.

1:11:04.825 --> 1:11:06.566
And what if I say no?

1:11:06.697 --> 1:11:10.091
Oh, then you have to
reassemble the parts yourself.

1:11:10.222 --> 1:11:14.400
How am I gonna get 10 million?
You've taken everything.

1:11:14.531 --> 1:11:19.492
Think of it as
full settlement of your debt.

1:11:19.623 --> 1:11:22.669
And, oh, uh...

1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:26.412
thank you
for disposing of Beaumont.

1:11:28.240 --> 1:11:30.677
Vee...

1:11:30.808 --> 1:11:35.029
Jack will never
appreciate you the way I do.

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:37.162
I get you the cash you need,

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:39.643
you get me onto
the board of directors,

1:11:39.773 --> 1:11:42.863
and you spare Jack's life.

1:11:42.994 --> 1:11:44.865
[chuckles]

1:11:44.996 --> 1:11:50.828
So finally,
the leopard reveals her spots.

1:11:50.958 --> 1:11:52.438
[chuckles]

1:11:52.569 --> 1:11:56.399
Talk to that lawyer, Fleet.

1:11:58.096 --> 1:12:02.187
Let's pretend you can do
what you say you can.

1:12:02.318 --> 1:12:07.105
How can we be sure
that he's going to pay?

1:12:07.235 --> 1:12:09.499
It's my life.

1:12:09.629 --> 1:12:12.458
Jack will pay.

1:12:12.589 --> 1:12:15.287
We got collateral debts to you.

1:12:16.419 --> 1:12:17.681
Well...

1:12:20.727 --> 1:12:23.251
I have three conditions.

1:12:23.382 --> 1:12:28.256
One: 10 million in cash.

1:12:28.387 --> 1:12:32.304
Two: Jack is humiliated,

1:12:32.435 --> 1:12:35.438
and if he ever shows
his face again,

1:12:35.568 --> 1:12:39.703
the heavens plays
for death of a princess.

1:12:39.833 --> 1:12:42.358
What's the third condition?

1:12:50.278 --> 1:12:51.976
You.

1:12:56.154 --> 1:12:59.287
[seagulls squawking]

1:13:16.957 --> 1:13:18.481
On us, Mr. Leyton.

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:33.017
Stay for a few more.
Keep the bar open.

1:13:35.759 --> 1:13:38.065
You look like
you can use it.

1:13:53.559 --> 1:13:56.257
JACK: What did she do
after she killed Benny?

1:14:00.392 --> 1:14:03.439
Jesus Christ! What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:14:03.569 --> 1:14:05.528
I'm here because of you.

1:14:12.578 --> 1:14:13.492
Do you like it?

1:14:14.754 --> 1:14:15.929
Jack, Jack, stop!

1:14:16.060 --> 1:14:17.844
[tires screeching]

1:14:20.368 --> 1:14:21.500
[horn honks]

1:14:21.631 --> 1:14:23.371
Jack, you could have
killed us both!

1:14:23.502 --> 1:14:25.678
Tell me everything you know,
and I'll take you to the money.

1:14:25.809 --> 1:14:27.114
Fuck the money!

1:14:31.510 --> 1:14:34.426
Look, it's not safe
for you here!

1:14:34.557 --> 1:14:36.384
I'm worried about you, Page!

1:14:36.515 --> 1:14:40.127
These people, Zaney, Karim,
you have no fucking idea!

1:14:40.258 --> 1:14:43.957
You're worried about me?
Why'd you put a gun to my head?

1:14:44.088 --> 1:14:46.438
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

1:14:48.832 --> 1:14:51.487
I'm losing my fucking mind here.

1:14:53.010 --> 1:14:55.491
Will you please
just get back in the car?

1:14:57.405 --> 1:14:58.711
Please.

1:15:06.632 --> 1:15:07.981
JACK: I realize there are
people out there

1:15:08.112 --> 1:15:09.809
who don't much care about me.

1:15:09.940 --> 1:15:12.464
About us, Page.

1:15:12.595 --> 1:15:15.380
So from now on,
I'm gonna protect you.

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:17.774
PAGE: How will you
protect me, Jack?

1:15:17.904 --> 1:15:20.385
JACK: Look, when this
is all sorted,

1:15:20.516 --> 1:15:22.430
I'm gonna start fresh.

1:15:22.561 --> 1:15:25.129
Australia.

1:15:25.259 --> 1:15:26.478
You should come too.

1:15:34.747 --> 1:15:36.009
Here.

1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:37.663
Merci.

1:15:43.887 --> 1:15:45.932
I want the same, you know.

1:15:46.063 --> 1:15:49.545
Did you tell him
about the money?

1:15:52.896 --> 1:15:55.028
Okay, forget it.
I'll deal with it.

1:15:55.159 --> 1:15:57.030
Tell me about London.

1:16:04.255 --> 1:16:05.996
She put me there.

1:16:08.912 --> 1:16:11.392
I had no idea.

1:16:11.523 --> 1:16:12.916
Ronny?

1:16:15.005 --> 1:16:17.224
So we both lost her.

1:16:20.097 --> 1:16:23.491
Maybe she had more to lose
than either of us.

1:16:24.580 --> 1:16:26.494
I just need a minute.

1:16:31.891 --> 1:16:35.547
JACK: I overheard  a conversation, long forgotten.

1:16:35.678 --> 1:16:38.332
Couldn't make sense of it
at the time.

1:16:38.463 --> 1:16:40.465
But now...

1:16:40.596 --> 1:16:43.903
[speaking French]

1:16:53.217 --> 1:16:55.306
- Okay?
- Okay.

1:16:57.177 --> 1:16:59.223
VERONIQUE: You think this is
all about the money?

1:16:59.353 --> 1:17:00.877
Poor Jack.

1:17:03.444 --> 1:17:05.142
[distant gunshot]

1:17:12.062 --> 1:17:13.193
Page?

1:17:29.732 --> 1:17:32.560
Don't let him hurt me.

1:17:32.691 --> 1:17:33.692
[gunshot]

1:17:41.047 --> 1:17:43.746
PAGE: Zaney says
you're sitting on a fortune.

1:17:43.876 --> 1:17:46.226
ZANEY: I'm not the low-life
you think I am.

1:17:46.357 --> 1:17:47.314
[horn honks]

1:17:57.716 --> 1:17:58.935
I'm looking for Zaney.

1:17:59.065 --> 1:18:01.589
Oh, hasn't been in yet.

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:03.722
Are you sure
he's not here, Tom?

1:18:03.853 --> 1:18:05.593
His van's outside.
The door's open.

1:18:05.724 --> 1:18:06.986
Lots of people all day.

1:18:07.117 --> 1:18:10.381
He's never usually late
like this.

1:18:11.469 --> 1:18:12.949
Any message?

1:18:14.254 --> 1:18:16.909
GRANT: Jack, we need to talk.

1:18:17.040 --> 1:18:19.738
Lane's alive.  He's got that picture of Ronny,

1:18:19.869 --> 1:18:21.609
the one you said
the girl stole.

1:18:21.740 --> 1:18:23.873
Holla back, yeah? ASAP.

1:18:29.574 --> 1:18:31.750
This is Grant. Leave a message. [beep]

1:18:31.881 --> 1:18:33.534
JACK: Grant,
for Christ's sake, call me.

1:18:33.665 --> 1:18:35.188
It's him.

1:18:35.319 --> 1:18:38.104
- [phone buzzing]
- Time to perform, Fleet.

1:18:44.807 --> 1:18:46.634
Fleet, what's going on?
Is Grant there to see you?

1:18:46.765 --> 1:18:49.333
Your friend's disappeared.
Things are going crazy here.

1:18:49.463 --> 1:18:51.335
If Karim's resurfaced,

1:18:51.465 --> 1:18:54.120
it's only a matter of time
before he finds you.

1:18:54.251 --> 1:18:56.296
Someone on your end
must have tipped him off.

1:18:56.427 --> 1:18:58.124
But you've gotta tell me
where you are.

1:18:58.255 --> 1:18:59.343
Hey!

1:18:59.473 --> 1:19:01.519
Jack, are you there?

1:19:01.649 --> 1:19:03.564
I need to talk to you.

1:19:03.695 --> 1:19:04.696
Hey!

1:19:07.177 --> 1:19:08.656
Zaney!

1:19:12.138 --> 1:19:13.270
Zaney!

1:19:15.185 --> 1:19:16.577
Zaney!

1:19:26.022 --> 1:19:27.632
Zaney.

1:19:28.807 --> 1:19:29.808
Hey!

1:19:29.939 --> 1:19:31.854
Come here, you little prick!

1:19:31.984 --> 1:19:34.770
Mr. Leyton, what's going on?
What is this?

1:19:34.900 --> 1:19:36.641
Don't give me
that "Mr. Leyton" shit.

1:19:36.772 --> 1:19:37.816
You know who I am.

1:19:42.212 --> 1:19:45.084
I'm gonna kill Karim, but first,
I'll fucking kill you.

1:19:45.215 --> 1:19:46.694
Should've let Page
out of this, Zaney.

1:19:46.825 --> 1:19:48.435
[gun cocks]

1:19:48.566 --> 1:19:50.437
It's not me she's afraid of.
It's you.

1:19:50.568 --> 1:19:52.178
The fuck does that mean?

1:19:52.309 --> 1:19:56.052
Please, please, it's me,
Steinjo.

1:19:56.182 --> 1:19:57.793
Why are you doing this? Why?

1:20:09.630 --> 1:20:12.808
You're fucking psycho, Leyton!
What you trying to prove?

1:20:14.766 --> 1:20:16.681
You come to my bar every day
with that silly dog

1:20:16.812 --> 1:20:18.291
and try to impress Angela.

1:20:18.422 --> 1:20:20.076
- But guess what.
- Aww...

1:20:20.206 --> 1:20:21.947
- Isn't he gorgeous?
- She.

1:20:22.078 --> 1:20:25.298
She only cares about the dog.
She just fucking likes the dog!

1:20:25.429 --> 1:20:26.865
I'm just...

1:20:26.996 --> 1:20:28.475
[mutters]

1:20:29.563 --> 1:20:31.261
Page, Steinjo...

1:20:31.391 --> 1:20:35.874
Zaney, Ronny, Page, Ronny...
[echoing]

1:20:40.400 --> 1:20:42.402
ANGELA: Are you okay?
STEINJO: He's got a fucking gun!

1:20:42.533 --> 1:20:44.100
Oh, my God! What?

1:20:44.230 --> 1:20:45.753
Okay, go, go.

1:20:47.016 --> 1:20:49.366
JACK: This can't be happening.

1:20:49.496 --> 1:20:50.802
Page!

1:20:53.631 --> 1:20:56.025
Who is it, Page?

1:20:56.155 --> 1:20:58.505
Who's gonna hurt you?

1:20:58.636 --> 1:21:00.072
Page!

1:21:06.731 --> 1:21:07.950
Page!

1:21:10.082 --> 1:21:11.344
Page!

1:21:18.003 --> 1:21:19.222
Ronny?

1:21:58.783 --> 1:22:00.437
[cocks shotgun]

1:22:00.567 --> 1:22:02.569
Don't let him hurt me.

1:22:04.180 --> 1:22:05.485
[gunshot]

1:22:07.444 --> 1:22:08.749
KARIM: Where's my money, Jack?

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:10.229
I wanna see my wife first.

1:22:10.360 --> 1:22:11.883
Just get it done and get out.

1:22:12.014 --> 1:22:13.537
Let's see the money first.

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:27.812
Don't let him hurt me.

1:22:27.943 --> 1:22:28.856
JACK: Ronny, move!

1:22:33.644 --> 1:22:35.254
[tires screeching]

1:22:58.669 --> 1:22:59.713
I killed her.

1:23:02.064 --> 1:23:03.065
She's dead.

1:23:06.024 --> 1:23:09.854
[horn honking]

1:23:09.985 --> 1:23:11.029

ANNOUNCER: This is Buck,
laid off for Harry Page.

1:24:32.676 --> 1:24:34.982
Crosses Goode, Murdoch sweeps.

1:24:35.113 --> 1:24:37.115
Jack Stracken scores!

1:24:41.772 --> 1:24:44.079
ANNOUNCER:
Harry Page, Murdoch...

1:24:47.517 --> 1:24:49.606
FLEET: Jack.

1:24:49.736 --> 1:24:52.348
JACK: Fleet,
I remember everything.

1:24:52.478 --> 1:24:54.001
Where are you, Jack?

1:24:55.786 --> 1:24:58.093
Norway. Trondelag.

1:25:00.095 --> 1:25:02.358
Great.

1:25:02.488 --> 1:25:04.969
I'll send someone.

1:25:44.400 --> 1:25:45.401
FLEET: Jack?

1:25:48.578 --> 1:25:50.493
Jack, are you all right?

1:25:59.458 --> 1:26:01.330
Are your friends
coming to say hello?

1:26:01.460 --> 1:26:05.029
For fuck's sake, Jack,
it's me.

1:26:07.336 --> 1:26:09.555
Why don't you just
give the money back?

1:26:09.686 --> 1:26:11.731
Fuck! Don't blow this up!

1:26:16.780 --> 1:26:18.085
[screams]

1:26:18.216 --> 1:26:20.131
[gunshots]

1:27:06.482 --> 1:27:08.484
I killed the decoy.

1:27:08.614 --> 1:27:10.529
Which means...

1:27:36.903 --> 1:27:38.383
[coughing]

1:27:38.514 --> 1:27:40.777
Come on out, Jack,
before you burn!

1:27:40.907 --> 1:27:42.779
Money's in here with me, Lane!

1:27:42.909 --> 1:27:44.868
Why don't you
come and get it?

1:27:44.998 --> 1:27:47.349
KARIM: It has never been
about the money, Jack!

1:27:47.479 --> 1:27:49.264
It's the principle!

1:27:52.484 --> 1:27:54.486
You think I don't know that,
you sick fuck?

1:27:56.183 --> 1:27:57.881
Second-rate player
steals your fucking queen,

1:27:58.011 --> 1:27:59.622
you just don't take it.

1:27:59.752 --> 1:28:02.538
KARIM: That queen came running
right back to me, Jack!

1:28:02.668 --> 1:28:03.930
Did she?

1:28:04.061 --> 1:28:06.019
You killed
an innocent girl, Jack.

1:28:06.150 --> 1:28:08.674
You set that whole thing up just
to see me suffer, didn't you?

1:28:08.805 --> 1:28:11.373
Keep telling yourself that
if that makes you--

1:29:26.317 --> 1:29:29.015

Nothing in life becomes so quiet
like the leaving of it.

1:31:54.770 --> 1:31:56.946
Eh, Jack?

1:31:57.076 --> 1:32:00.776
That's the look
I wanted to see in London.

1:32:00.906 --> 1:32:02.255
Abject failure.

1:32:02.386 --> 1:32:04.475
Now you know how it feels.

1:32:04.606 --> 1:32:05.520
[gunshot]

1:32:10.263 --> 1:32:11.656
Vee.

1:32:11.787 --> 1:32:14.790
Don't call me that.
You know I hate it.

1:32:16.574 --> 1:32:18.881
You thought I enjoyed
fucking you

1:32:19.011 --> 1:32:20.883
if I wasn't getting
my football club in return?

1:32:22.319 --> 1:32:23.494
[groans]

1:32:23.625 --> 1:32:28.281
Ridiculous men.
All money, sex, and ego.

1:32:30.153 --> 1:32:32.677
Can you walk?

1:32:32.808 --> 1:32:34.287
[seagulls squawking]

1:32:34.418 --> 1:32:35.375
[coughs]

1:32:42.818 --> 1:32:46.386
Veronique, I told myself
you were dead.

1:32:46.517 --> 1:32:51.304
And I told myself
that at least you were alive.

1:32:55.918 --> 1:32:57.876
I needed more, Jack.

1:33:08.495 --> 1:33:10.106
Split it, Jack.

1:33:12.499 --> 1:33:14.937
Don't look at me like that.

1:33:15.067 --> 1:33:16.939
You wouldn't take care of me,

1:33:17.069 --> 1:33:20.551
so I went back to him
and made a deal.

1:33:20.682 --> 1:33:22.988
He wanted to see you
with nothing.

1:33:23.119 --> 1:33:25.425
So you use a girl.

1:33:25.556 --> 1:33:27.863
Would you rather
have killed me?

1:33:27.993 --> 1:33:31.170
You should have stayed hidden.

1:33:31.301 --> 1:33:33.651
And sending Grant
was a mistake.

1:33:33.782 --> 1:33:34.957
Yeah.

1:33:41.746 --> 1:33:45.576
So what do we do
about the money?

1:33:48.666 --> 1:33:50.581
The club is all yours now.

1:34:03.246 --> 1:34:04.943
[motor starts]

1:34:11.210 --> 1:34:12.690
What was her name?

1:34:12.821 --> 1:34:14.736
What difference does it make?

1:34:17.608 --> 1:34:20.567
[motor revs]

1:34:29.664 --> 1:34:32.536
â™ª Up here in the now

1:34:33.972 --> 1:34:36.627
â™ª Where the sky is low

1:34:38.803 --> 1:34:41.763
â™ª Been wondering, lost

1:34:43.939 --> 1:34:47.203
â™ª More unsure than strong

1:34:48.770 --> 1:34:51.468
â™ª Between guilt and doubt

1:34:53.557 --> 1:34:58.170
â™ª What is there to find

1:34:58.301 --> 1:35:00.782
â™ª More than innocence

1:35:00.912 --> 1:35:04.089
â™ª I been drowning in dreams

1:35:04.220 --> 1:35:06.918
â™ª And crying

1:35:07.049 --> 1:35:12.619
â™ª So I drink, drink

1:35:12.750 --> 1:35:16.101
â™ª Drink to remember

1:35:16.232 --> 1:35:21.716
â™ª And I drink, drink

1:35:21.846 --> 1:35:27.678
â™ª Drink to dream

1:35:27.809 --> 1:35:31.769
â™ª There's fog on the river

1:35:31.900 --> 1:35:36.600
â™ª And the world stands still

1:35:36.731 --> 1:35:40.386
â™ª You're my shadow

1:35:40.517 --> 1:35:46.218
â™ª And all my sins

1:35:46.349 --> 1:35:51.093
â™ª I won't surrender

1:35:51.223 --> 1:35:55.706
â™ª Jailing you morning

1:35:55.837 --> 1:36:00.755
â™ª Comes to take me back

1:36:00.885 --> 1:36:04.323
â™ª Into their new light

1:36:04.454 --> 1:36:10.242
â™ª And I drink, drink

1:36:10.373 --> 1:36:14.116
â™ª Drink to remember

1:36:14.246 --> 1:36:19.338
â™ª And I drink, drink

1:36:19.469 --> 1:36:23.386
â™ª Drink to dream

1:36:43.232 --> 1:36:48.715
â™ª And I drink, drink

1:36:48.846 --> 1:36:52.415
â™ª Drink now to wonder

1:36:52.545 --> 1:36:58.334
â™ª And I drink, drink

1:36:58.464 --> 1:37:02.077
â™ª To see there

1:37:02.207 --> 1:37:07.473
â™ª And I drink, drink

1:37:07.604 --> 1:37:11.564
â™ª Drink to remember

1:37:11.695 --> 1:37:17.005
â™ª And I drink, drink

1:37:17.135 --> 1:37:21.487
â™ª Drink

1:37:21.618 --> 1:37:24.012
â™ª To dream
