02:22.987 --> 02:26.322

Congratulations, Blake,
you just finished that crossword puzzle

03:15.506 --> 03:16.889
in 7 minutes.

03:16.891 --> 03:18.991
I mean,
you could do it, too.

03:18.993 --> 03:20.492
I've done it in 5 1/2,
actually.

03:20.494 --> 03:21.961
There's a theory about
pattern recognition

03:21.963 --> 03:23.829
where you don't even
have to look at the clues anymore,

03:23.831 --> 03:25.664
but I found that going across
instead of down helps

03:25.666 --> 03:28.467
because the sequence of saccades
and fixations in traditional reading

03:28.469 --> 03:31.320
assist with other oculomotor
tasks such as solving crossword puzzles.

03:31.322 --> 03:33.222
Happy Wednesday, my nerds.

03:33.224 --> 03:34.506

you're here early.

03:34.508 --> 03:36.192
Well, apparently
not early enough.

03:56.714 --> 03:59.081
Oi! Let's do this.

04:01.701 --> 04:04.303
Garcia: Hi. Good morning.
No real time to get comfortable.

04:04.305 --> 04:05.755
Hotch: An hour ago,
the man on your tablets

04:05.757 --> 04:08.758
was found wandering the streets
of Baltimore before he collapsed.

04:08.760 --> 04:09.598
He is unconscious,

04:09.623 --> 04:11.623
he has no I.D. on him,
so we don't know his name.

04:12.480 --> 04:13.979
He's got ligature marks
on his wrists,

04:13.981 --> 04:16.048
and it's impossible to tell
how long he's been missing.

04:16.050 --> 04:18.517
Are those puncture wounds
in the corner of his eyes?

04:18.519 --> 04:22.154
Yes, and an MRI confirmed
that fibers in his brain had been severed.

04:22.156 --> 04:23.656
He had a lobotomy?

04:23.658 --> 04:25.491
There was hemorrhaging
and foreign object splinters

04:25.493 --> 04:26.909
imbedded behind
his right eye.

04:26.911 --> 04:28.778
Most likely from whatever
tool the unsub used.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.312
My guess would be
an icepick.

04:30.314 --> 04:32.281
The guy's still alive.
Can we talk to him?

04:32.283 --> 04:33.482
You should try.

04:33.484 --> 04:35.000
Someone with such
a specific M.O.

04:35.002 --> 04:36.485
has probably
done this before.

04:36.487 --> 04:38.003
We just don't know
about it yet.

04:38.005 --> 04:39.455
It's all being
run through ViCAP.

04:39.457 --> 04:40.456
Yes, it is.

04:40.458 --> 04:41.674
The entry points in his eyes

04:41.676 --> 04:44.126
are from an outpatient-style
traditional lobotomy.

04:44.128 --> 04:46.463
Less mess than drilling holes
like Dahmer did.

04:46.464 --> 04:48.464
And Dahmer's method killed.
This didn't.

04:48.466 --> 04:50.983
So either the unsub
is lucky or he has medical training.

04:50.985 --> 04:53.019
He wanted his victim
to survive.

04:53.021 --> 04:54.570
We need to canvass the area
where he was found.

04:54.572 --> 04:56.822
He wouldn't have walked
very far in this condition.

04:56.824 --> 04:58.991
Well, lobotomies are considered
to be the surgery of the soul.

04:58.993 --> 05:01.360
Doctors like Walter Freeman
claimed they could cure

05:01.362 --> 05:02.444
a number of mental illnesses.

05:02.469 --> 05:04.495
He believed the procedure
could relieve suffering.

05:04.599 --> 05:06.749
Excuse me, Agent Hotchner.
Agent Cruz is here.

05:06.751 --> 05:09.001
Oh. Everyone, this is
our new section chief.

05:09.003 --> 05:11.454
This is Agent Mateo Cruz.
These are agents Blake--

05:11.456 --> 05:12.955
Blake, Dr. Reid, Morgan,

05:12.957 --> 05:15.041
Jareau, and Rossi.

05:15.043 --> 05:16.759

05:16.761 --> 05:19.378
Oh, and Penelope Garcia.

05:19.380 --> 05:21.514
Erin Strauss always spoke
very highly of you.

05:21.516 --> 05:23.499
Oh. Thank you.

05:23.501 --> 05:25.518
I spoke to the Baltimore office.
Seems like like they're at a loss.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.852
When the identity
of the victim is unknown,

05:26.854 --> 05:29.522
it makes everything
that much harder.

05:29.524 --> 05:32.508
I'd like to join you.
It's not every day

05:32.510 --> 05:34.393
that these cases take you
an hour away from home, so...

05:34.395 --> 05:36.195
Hotch: We leave
in 20 minutes.

05:44.854 --> 05:47.206
You could have
mentioned this.

05:47.208 --> 05:49.358
I thought
you liked surprises.

05:49.360 --> 05:54.046

06:14.652 --> 06:16.352

to the police.

06:16.354 --> 06:18.053
I just heard
the FBI is coming.

06:18.055 --> 06:19.722
Good. When will they get here?

06:19.724 --> 06:21.857
Can you turn those down?
It's hot.

06:21.859 --> 06:23.025
How are you doing?

06:23.027 --> 06:24.560
My head hurts
worse than it was.

06:24.562 --> 06:26.078
Can you just...

06:26.080 --> 06:27.530
Thanks, that's better.

06:27.532 --> 06:29.915
You have an I.V.
to keep you hydrated.

06:29.917 --> 06:33.369
And I've prescribed propofol
to help with any discomfort.

06:33.371 --> 06:35.738
Good, 'cause my head's
gonna explode.

06:35.740 --> 06:37.707
Can you take this thing off?

06:37.709 --> 06:39.175
Get that started.
Yes, doctor.

06:39.177 --> 06:42.678
Please, turn those down.
It's too bright.

06:42.680 --> 06:44.463
Wait, what's going on?

06:44.465 --> 06:46.549

A lobotomy is supposed to

But it's hard to know if
that's what he was trying to do

Jeffrey Dahmer fantasized about men

chose a victim who won't be missed.

in his hunting,

09:08.151 --> 09:09.652
He's been in and out

09:09.654 --> 09:11.153
I've had to stabilize
his head,

09:11.155 --> 09:12.655
given the extent
of the injuries.

09:12.657 --> 09:13.989
He's sedated
to help with the pain.

09:13.991 --> 09:15.491
But don't those meds
cause amnesia?

09:15.493 --> 09:16.992
Sometimes. But I don't
have a choice.

09:16.994 --> 09:18.661

he'll be miserable.

09:50.928 --> 09:52.695
Look, you gotta help me.

09:52.697 --> 09:55.180
I'm probably not the first
person to ask you that, am I?

09:55.182 --> 09:56.899
More like the tenth.

09:59.319 --> 10:01.870
There are ways to figure
things out without words.

10:01.872 --> 10:03.405
I'd like to try that
with you, ok?

10:03.407 --> 10:04.540
Ok.

10:04.542 --> 10:06.408
For example, can you blink
if you understand?

10:06.410 --> 10:07.576
Would that work for you?

10:07.578 --> 10:09.578
Blink once if it does.

10:09.580 --> 10:10.846
Ok.

10:10.848 --> 10:12.915
Perfect.

10:12.917 --> 10:15.050

10:15.052 --> 10:16.218
No.

10:50.254 --> 10:53.172
There were a bunch
of warehouses.

10:56.459 --> 10:58.544
I'm sorry, man.

10:59.896 --> 11:01.880
That's not what I wrote.

11:04.717 --> 11:06.885
Look, the person
who did is to you

11:06.887 --> 11:08.387
messed up your ability
to talk,

11:08.389 --> 11:10.889
but we're gonna
get through it, all right?

11:10.891 --> 11:13.442
What happened to me?

11:13.444 --> 11:15.310
What's happening?

11:15.312 --> 11:16.528
Ok, here.

11:16.530 --> 11:18.030
I need you to try
and stay calm,

11:18.032 --> 11:20.532
but I can show you
what you look like if you want.

11:20.534 --> 11:22.584
You sure you want to see?

11:22.586 --> 11:24.286
Yeah. Show me.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.490
Oh...

11:28.492 --> 11:31.894
Oh, my God.

11:31.896 --> 11:34.196
The victim was found
just after dawn.

11:34.198 --> 11:36.882
It could mean the unsub has a job
that requires him to leave early.

11:36.884 --> 11:39.551
My guess is his social
skills are lacking,

11:39.553 --> 11:41.536
and that'll be reflected
in his type of work.

11:41.538 --> 11:44.539
S.A.C. is in the field but called
to say whatever you need, you got it.

11:44.541 --> 11:47.142
The recovery site's
surrounded by abandoned warehouses.

11:47.144 --> 11:49.628
He needs the desolation to
enforce his power and control.

11:49.630 --> 11:51.096
There's a team looking
through the building now.

11:51.098 --> 11:53.348
This unsub doesn't leave
anything to luck.

11:53.350 --> 11:56.768
There was a garbage truck
that sticks to a schedule.

11:56.770 --> 11:57.769
Hey, Hotch.

11:57.771 --> 11:59.087
Did you talk to the driver?

11:59.089 --> 12:00.589
Yeah, according to him,
the victim

12:00.591 --> 12:02.090
looked and sounded
like a zombie.

12:02.092 --> 12:03.809
There's no way
he made it far.

12:03.811 --> 12:05.844
Most of the buildings
down here are boarded up.

12:05.846 --> 12:07.946
We're starting with
the closest one.

12:07.948 --> 12:09.681
The victim
was in such bad shape,

12:09.683 --> 12:11.566
he probably didn't
walk the stairs by himself.

12:11.568 --> 12:14.036
He was either held
on the first floor

12:14.038 --> 12:15.487
and luckily
made it out...

12:15.489 --> 12:18.524
Or he didn't escape at all.
The unsub let him go.

12:20.193 --> 12:22.744
[Train whistle blowing]

12:28.401 --> 12:31.720
[Indistinct chatter]

12:53.076 --> 12:54.376
[Gasping]

12:55.444 --> 12:57.129
[Moans]

13:05.205 --> 13:06.889
Come on, stay with me.

13:06.891 --> 13:08.557
I'm just so tired.

13:08.559 --> 13:10.108
Let me get this right.

13:10.110 --> 13:12.344
He's working alone?

13:12.346 --> 13:13.679
Yes.

13:13.681 --> 13:15.731
But what?

13:15.733 --> 13:18.400
Was it more than
one of you there?

13:18.402 --> 13:20.502
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

13:20.504 --> 13:22.221
We gotta figure out
another way to do this.

13:22.223 --> 13:23.739
My eyes are killing me.

13:23.741 --> 13:25.290
Was it another guy?

13:25.292 --> 13:27.559
No.

13:28.578 --> 13:30.629
Was it a girl?

13:30.631 --> 13:32.764
Yes.

13:32.766 --> 13:34.116
Do you know her?

13:34.118 --> 13:36.785
Yes, I know her.

13:36.787 --> 13:39.871
Dana? Dana!

13:39.873 --> 13:42.374
Dana...

13:45.094 --> 13:46.395
Here's where he held him.

13:46.397 --> 13:48.931
Why would he
let this guy go?

13:48.933 --> 13:51.550
He wants him to suffer.

13:54.287 --> 13:55.854
Whoa!

13:55.856 --> 13:56.855
Ooh.

13:56.857 --> 13:57.856
Oh...

13:57.858 --> 13:59.474
What the hell is that?

14:01.277 --> 14:03.528
Adult diapers.

14:03.530 --> 14:05.697
Medical soap.

14:05.699 --> 14:07.182
Toothbrushes.

14:07.184 --> 14:09.034
He took care
of this victim.

14:09.036 --> 14:11.954
Only to ensure
he'd stay alive.

14:14.040 --> 14:17.125
This looks small.

14:18.211 --> 14:20.912
Why would he leave
these behind?

14:20.914 --> 14:23.582
'Cause he wants us
to know something.

14:23.584 --> 14:28.420
Hotch, the unsub also
had a female victim.

14:43.486 --> 14:45.153
They ran
the victim's prints,

14:45.155 --> 14:46.721
but he wasn't
in any database.

14:46.723 --> 14:48.723
He doesn't have
any track marks,

14:48.725 --> 14:50.392
and the tox screen
is clean.

14:50.394 --> 14:53.362
This isn't the kind of guy who would
hang out in that neighborhood.

14:53.364 --> 14:55.197
It rules out the
high-risk behavior theory,

14:55.199 --> 14:56.898
but it doesn't answer
why he wouldn't be missed.

14:56.900 --> 14:58.250
That's what we're
working on right now.

14:58.252 --> 15:00.535
What 20-something nowadays
wouldn't be missed?

15:00.537 --> 15:03.672
I mean, with social media alone,
there's constant contact.

15:03.674 --> 15:04.840
What's this?

15:04.842 --> 15:06.174
Over 50 universities
in the state,

15:06.176 --> 15:07.676
50 more if you add
D.C. and Virginia.

15:07.678 --> 15:09.961
The students are the most
socially active of all.

15:09.963 --> 15:12.597
Why aren't we looking into someone
with a more isolated existence?

15:12.599 --> 15:15.300
The low-risk behavior of the victim
tells us a lot about his lifestyle.

15:15.302 --> 15:18.103
He might stalk the most isolated victims
knowing that they won't be missed.

15:18.105 --> 15:20.972
That's smart.
Campuses are a great place to blend in,

15:20.974 --> 15:23.191
and all of those schools
look within a two-hour drive.

15:23.193 --> 15:24.643
[Ring]
Go ahead, Garcia.

15:24.645 --> 15:28.596
There are over 100,000 kids enrolled
in Maryland colleges alone,

15:28.598 --> 15:31.283
another hundred in Northern Virginia
and the district.

15:31.285 --> 15:33.001
All right, send out a photo of the victim
to all the campuses.

15:33.003 --> 15:34.469
Somebody's going
to recognize him.

15:34.471 --> 15:36.371
And, sir, I did that search
through ViCAP.

15:36.373 --> 15:37.839
Nothing in the states.

15:37.841 --> 15:39.541
So I figured it'd be ok
to cast a wider net,

15:39.543 --> 15:41.376
and I asked a brilliant
ex-coworker of ours,

15:41.378 --> 15:44.379
and guess what--Emily found
a single incident on Interpol.

15:44.381 --> 15:45.964
It looked like a one-hit
wonder until now.

15:45.966 --> 15:47.132
Where?

15:48.835 --> 15:50.302
Berlin.

15:50.304 --> 15:51.486
Germany?

15:51.488 --> 15:52.838
Germany?
What about Germany?

15:52.840 --> 15:54.990
A male victim.

15:54.992 --> 15:57.225
Come here. Come here.

15:58.494 --> 16:00.062
Come here.

16:00.930 --> 16:03.098
Hotch, I gotta go.

16:07.970 --> 16:11.022
Does Germany
mean something to you?

16:11.024 --> 16:12.324
Dana lived there. Yes.

16:12.326 --> 16:14.092
Yes, it means something.

16:14.094 --> 16:16.978
Ok, this is good.
We're getting somewhere.

16:16.980 --> 16:18.851
Doc, when he's awake,

16:18.876 --> 16:20.199
he definitely knows
what's going on.

16:20.200 --> 16:21.366
I'd like you to get me

16:21.368 --> 16:22.501
a communication board.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.169
I want to get him to
spell some things out.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.204
That's great. I'll
get one in here.

16:26.206 --> 16:28.039
I'm just checking
your eyes again.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.108
The swelling's gone down.

16:30.110 --> 16:32.544
Cranial nerves and pupil
reflex looks normal,

16:32.546 --> 16:34.129
considering the trauma.

16:35.882 --> 16:38.683
This isn't right.

16:38.685 --> 16:41.937
What is it? What's wrong?
What do you see?

16:41.939 --> 16:45.307
Open your eyes wide as you can.

16:53.682 --> 16:55.617
Hello.

17:12.253 --> 17:14.955
The doctor's gonna see
if he can remove the camera.

17:14.958 --> 17:17.157
He was blinking the whole time.
It's how he communicated,

17:17.160 --> 17:19.094
but I don't know how
I didn't see this sooner.

17:19.096 --> 17:20.962
The eye is the most
confined space in the body,

17:20.964 --> 17:23.314
which means the camera's
probably 3 to 4 millimeters long

17:23.316 --> 17:25.684
and difficult to see
without a microscopic lens.

17:25.685 --> 17:27.352
Is it a prosthetic eye?

17:27.354 --> 17:29.303
No. It's right next
to the pupil.

17:29.305 --> 17:32.907
That must be the unidentified
splinter the MRI showed.

17:32.909 --> 17:35.944
It's an ocular nano-implant.

17:35.946 --> 17:37.185
All right, thanks.

17:37.210 --> 17:38.480
Garcia's searching
for the transmission

17:38.481 --> 17:40.198
but it's bouncing
all over the city.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.816
They're usually controlled
by cell phone,

17:41.818 --> 17:45.136
which needs to be within
a specific distance, so he's close.

17:45.138 --> 17:46.538
I know they've developed
the technology,

17:46.540 --> 17:47.756
but it isn't widely known.

17:47.758 --> 17:49.424
Actually it is,
if you know who to call.

17:49.426 --> 17:51.092
Everything's
on the black market.

17:51.094 --> 17:52.894
It's expensive
but not high-tech.

17:52.896 --> 17:54.879
Should we be looking
at micro surgeons?

17:54.881 --> 17:56.097
There's no need.
The camera itself

17:56.099 --> 17:57.298
is smaller than
the point of a needle.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.695
That's usually
how they inject it.

17:58.696 --> 17:59.426
That's weird.

17:59.451 --> 18:01.612
He fancied an old-fashioned
technique for the lobotomy,

18:01.638 --> 18:04.039
but the camera tells us
that he's technically inclined.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.691
What about this German victim?
How does he tie in?

18:06.693 --> 18:09.060
The M.E. report says that
he survived the lobotomy

18:09.062 --> 18:10.762
but was later
shot in the head.

18:10.764 --> 18:11.896
Why?

18:11.898 --> 18:14.399
He was a test run
for the current victim.

18:14.401 --> 18:16.201
Once the theory was proved
he was no longer needed.

18:16.203 --> 18:18.453
Cruz: Did he install a camera
in that victim's eye, too?

18:18.455 --> 18:19.520
Hotch: No.

18:19.522 --> 18:20.855
There's something special
about this guy.

18:20.857 --> 18:22.190
Where did their paths cross?

18:22.192 --> 18:24.375
Garcia's compiling a list
of foreign exchange students.

18:24.377 --> 18:26.127
That should be a more
manageable number.

18:26.129 --> 18:27.746
You would think so, but D.C.
has the highest concentration

18:27.748 --> 18:29.197
of exchange students
in the nation,

18:29.199 --> 18:30.882
which means we're
still looking at tens of thousands.

18:30.884 --> 18:34.085
And we're also running
facial recognition on student visas.

18:34.087 --> 18:35.837
That's all good,
but now what?

18:35.839 --> 18:38.973
We figure out why
he's doing it.

18:38.975 --> 18:42.844
[Whimpering, moaning]

18:43.763 --> 18:46.097
This escalation could be
the unsub's message

18:46.099 --> 18:48.149
about the eyes being
windows to the soul.

18:48.151 --> 18:49.267
There's something to that.

18:49.269 --> 18:50.819
The same genes
that develop the iris

18:50.821 --> 18:52.270
also shape the frontal lobe,

18:52.272 --> 18:53.655
which influences personality.

18:53.657 --> 18:55.657
Why is this part of his ritual now
but it wasn't in Berlin?

18:55.659 --> 18:57.776
Well, that's unclear,
but his first kill in Berlin

18:57.778 --> 18:59.727
means he has a significant
connection there.

18:59.729 --> 19:03.164
He's likely visiting the U.S.
and he feels out of place.

19:03.166 --> 19:05.500
And that may be how he
connected with his victims.

19:05.502 --> 19:07.401
He's definitely
had medical training.

19:07.403 --> 19:08.903
His German victim
was a student,

19:08.905 --> 19:10.905
and the unsub may also
be in those circles.

19:10.907 --> 19:12.740
We need to check currently
enrolled medical students

19:12.742 --> 19:15.093
as well as recent dropouts,
both here and abroad.

19:15.095 --> 19:17.078
Blake: He's clearly
bright and capable.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.531
His torture suggests
he's experimenting,

19:19.533 --> 19:21.099
which could mean
he's bored.

19:21.101 --> 19:23.351
But with his intelligence
comes a dark side.

19:23.353 --> 19:26.254
And that's where his psychology
and genetics come into play.

19:26.256 --> 19:27.989
[Screaming]

19:27.991 --> 19:29.390
How do you know
those characteristics?

19:29.392 --> 19:32.560
We can only speculate,
but if his victims do represent him,

19:32.562 --> 19:34.629
then he's telling us that he feels
lobotomized and powerless.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.364
This could mean
he was raised in a strict home

19:36.366 --> 19:38.399
or one where he
didn't have a voice.

19:38.401 --> 19:40.485
[Gasps]

19:40.487 --> 19:41.703
Aah!

19:41.705 --> 19:43.855
Aah! Aah...

19:43.857 --> 19:47.192
Do you think he was heavily
medicated or institutionalized?

19:47.194 --> 19:49.110
Maybe. A majority of the lobotomy
patients in the 1940s

19:49.112 --> 19:51.246
were mentally ill and resided
in state-run institutions.

19:51.248 --> 19:54.249
The doctors there felt they were
providing mercy to the patients,

19:54.251 --> 19:55.439
but the use of the camera

19:55.464 --> 19:57.544
tells us that this unsub
wants his victims to suffer.

19:58.121 --> 20:00.171
And the emotional torture
of being left paralyzed

20:00.173 --> 20:00.972
is a kind of overkill,

20:00.997 --> 20:02.897
and that occurs when
there's a personal connection

20:02.909 --> 20:04.475
between the offender
and the victims.

20:04.477 --> 20:06.344
Reid: He wants them to suffer,
but he also wants to witness

20:06.346 --> 20:07.812
what it's like to be them.

20:07.814 --> 20:10.464
Blake: He's given himself
a front-row seat.

20:10.466 --> 20:12.150
And now that he knows
we're on the case,

20:12.152 --> 20:13.985
that kind of attention
could cause him to escalate.

20:13.987 --> 20:15.069
How so?

20:15.071 --> 20:18.089
He may want us to see
what he sees.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.774
So what did he say
when you asked

20:19.776 --> 20:21.659
if there was a woman
held with him?

20:21.661 --> 20:23.311
He didn't say a word.

20:23.313 --> 20:24.979
The guy's brain
got scrambled.

20:24.981 --> 20:26.981
I can't imagine
knowing what's going on

20:26.983 --> 20:28.816
but not being able
to say anything.

20:28.818 --> 20:30.652
I know he's only got
minimal gestures,

20:30.654 --> 20:32.837
but did he give you
any indication he knew her?

20:32.839 --> 20:34.488
Just shut his eyes,
the same way he did

20:34.490 --> 20:36.090
when he realized
he was paralyzed.

20:36.092 --> 20:37.759
Well, that's definitely
a sign.

20:37.761 --> 20:39.894
An emotional one.

20:39.896 --> 20:42.830
Well, if we say we have
a missing couple

20:42.832 --> 20:45.133
and we put his photo
around campuses,

20:45.135 --> 20:47.685
we might be able
to figure out who she is, too.

20:47.687 --> 20:49.888
Any word on the camera?

20:49.890 --> 20:51.339
Doctor's checking
the x-rays now

20:51.341 --> 20:52.690
to see if
he can get it out.

20:52.692 --> 20:54.559
If it's the nano-tech
I think it is,

20:54.561 --> 20:56.611
removing the piece could be
dangerous for the victim.

20:56.613 --> 20:58.413
At the very least
he could lose his eye.

20:58.415 --> 21:00.014
You've seen
this stuff before.

21:00.016 --> 21:01.347
Not quite like this,

21:01.372 --> 21:03.477
but it's used for foreign
counterintelligence.

21:03.753 --> 21:05.670
So then where
did he get it?

21:05.672 --> 21:08.239
It's like back-alley lasik.

21:08.241 --> 21:09.674
You're kidding me.

21:10.626 --> 21:12.577
We should just
shut his eyes.

21:12.579 --> 21:14.295
Show's over.

21:15.164 --> 21:18.416
Or we could play his game.

21:20.185 --> 21:22.136
They can't take it out.

21:22.138 --> 21:24.005
Not yet.

21:24.007 --> 21:25.498
Or I'll die, right?

21:25.499 --> 21:26.823
So why don't we try to focus

21:26.848 --> 21:28.568
on something that we can
control, all right?

21:32.064 --> 21:33.948
I'm going to point
to some rows,

21:33.950 --> 21:38.503
and I want you to tell me
if the letter that you need is in it.

21:38.505 --> 21:40.154
What's your name?

21:40.156 --> 21:41.139
Sam.

21:41.141 --> 21:42.173
First row.

21:42.175 --> 21:46.027
Second row.

21:46.029 --> 21:47.111
Third.

21:47.113 --> 21:48.146
Yes.

21:48.148 --> 21:50.381
Ok. Ok, that's good.
That's good.

21:52.785 --> 21:53.751
Yes.

21:53.753 --> 21:55.736
Yes.
"S"? Ok.

21:56.839 --> 21:59.841
What's the second letter?

21:59.843 --> 22:02.377
"A".

22:02.379 --> 22:04.228
"A".

22:04.230 --> 22:05.579
Ok.

22:05.581 --> 22:07.181
S-a...

22:07.183 --> 22:09.267
Sam.

22:09.269 --> 22:12.353
Sam C. I know he hasn't
spelled his whole name yet,

22:12.355 --> 22:14.205
but here he is.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.640
[Ring]
What have you got, Garcia?

22:15.642 --> 22:17.191
Victim's name is Sam Carter,

22:17.193 --> 22:19.093
and he's a grad student at...

22:19.095 --> 22:20.812
Morgan:
Johns Hopkins.

22:20.814 --> 22:22.847
This is great, Sam.
You're doing really great.

22:22.849 --> 22:25.950
Who is the woman
that was with you?

22:25.952 --> 22:28.236
Dana.

22:28.238 --> 22:30.571
Ok.

22:30.573 --> 22:32.156
No, "D".

22:32.158 --> 22:34.409
No.

22:35.311 --> 22:36.294
"D".

22:36.296 --> 22:38.162
Ok.
Yes.

22:38.164 --> 22:39.380
"D".

22:39.382 --> 22:42.083
What's the second letter?

22:45.054 --> 22:46.587
Yes.

22:46.589 --> 22:47.722
"A".
"A".

22:47.724 --> 22:49.440
Ok. D-a...

22:49.442 --> 22:50.791
Now the third letter.

22:50.793 --> 22:52.093
No, second row.

22:52.095 --> 22:53.344
Yes.

22:53.346 --> 22:54.345
Ok.

22:54.347 --> 22:56.397
It's "N", come on.

22:58.367 --> 23:00.134
"N", yes.

23:00.136 --> 23:01.936
"N". Ok.

23:01.938 --> 23:03.855
D-a-n...

23:03.857 --> 23:05.406
Keep going, Sam.

23:05.408 --> 23:06.374
First row.

23:06.376 --> 23:07.442
"A".
Sam.

23:07.444 --> 23:09.110
The medicine's
making me so drowsy.

23:09.112 --> 23:10.811
No--
"I"? Dani?

23:10.813 --> 23:12.447
Is it Danielle?

23:12.449 --> 23:14.982
I meant "A", not "I".
It's D-A-N-A.

23:14.984 --> 23:16.284
Go up a row.

23:16.286 --> 23:18.403
We're gonna look for all
the Danis that we can.

23:18.405 --> 23:21.205
But I need you to save
your strength for this next part.

23:21.207 --> 23:23.491
What next part?

23:23.493 --> 23:24.625
What now?

23:24.627 --> 23:26.761
We're gonna try to talk
to him through you.

23:26.763 --> 23:29.547
Just get Dana.
Don't let this happen to Dana.

23:29.549 --> 23:32.100
Yes, yes, talk to him.

23:32.102 --> 23:33.618
Now, are you sure
that you don't know him?

23:33.620 --> 23:35.136
I don't know him.
I'm sure.

23:35.138 --> 23:37.722
Ok. Just bear with me.

23:44.229 --> 23:46.647
Sam, the person
who did this to you

23:46.649 --> 23:50.868
is challenging us,
so sometimes we have to bluff.

23:50.870 --> 23:54.622
I don't think he can hear us,
but he's definitely watching.

23:54.624 --> 23:57.208
Come on--
No, no, Sam, Sam.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.659
Sam!

23:58.661 --> 23:59.961
I know you're tired.

23:59.963 --> 24:03.998
But I need you to try
and keep your eyes open.

24:08.137 --> 24:13.591
[Screaming]

24:15.644 --> 24:19.263
[Crying]

24:20.315 --> 24:22.150
Cheese.

24:25.654 --> 24:28.356
[Sobbing]

24:36.782 --> 24:38.699
Kevin, I cannot talk
right now. I'm swamped.

24:38.701 --> 24:39.667
Do you see it?

24:39.669 --> 24:41.285
Yes, I saw that you sent me
and email,

24:41.287 --> 24:42.837
Morgan's everywhere.
But I can't read it right--

24:42.839 --> 24:44.489
you gotta look.
Wait, what?

24:44.491 --> 24:46.340
What do you an, Morgan?

24:49.845 --> 24:52.430
I gotta go.

24:52.432 --> 24:54.465
The unsub is posting us
on the web.

24:54.467 --> 24:55.583
Yeah, we're seeing it, too.

24:55.585 --> 24:57.185
I can't shut it down.
It's going viral.

24:57.187 --> 24:59.003
It's streaming
all over the globe.

24:59.005 --> 25:00.021
Hey, Rossi.

25:00.023 --> 25:02.640
Ok, we got it.

25:02.642 --> 25:03.774
Sam, close your eyes.

25:03.776 --> 25:04.876
What? Why?
What's going on?

25:04.878 --> 25:07.578
The unsub's posting this.
Where?

25:07.580 --> 25:10.081
All over the world--live.

25:10.083 --> 25:11.949
Sam, close your eyes.

25:11.951 --> 25:13.267
Oh, God.

25:22.878 --> 25:26.780
[Gasping, crying out]

25:30.469 --> 25:32.487
You said he wanted us
to see.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.338
So why not go to the media?
Why the Internet?

25:34.340 --> 25:37.175
The media edits the message.
The Internet doesn't.

25:37.177 --> 25:38.442
He's calling our bluff.

25:38.444 --> 25:41.345
If we know who he is,
we should come and get him.

25:41.347 --> 25:44.098
[Whimpering]

26:01.816 --> 26:03.284
Use that board again.

26:03.286 --> 26:05.097
It's D-A-N-A.

26:05.098 --> 26:06.291
Please, pick it up.

26:06.292 --> 26:08.402
Sam, I know it's hard,

26:08.427 --> 26:10.327
but you gotta keep
your eyes closed.

26:10.426 --> 26:11.943
Just find her.

26:11.945 --> 26:15.279
Don't let them do this
to Dana.

26:15.281 --> 26:20.017
[Dana screaming]

26:24.806 --> 26:28.476
[Sobbing]

26:28.478 --> 26:32.480
[Screaming]

26:32.482 --> 26:35.349
[Continues screaming
and sobbing]

26:36.652 --> 26:38.736
Please, save me.

26:38.738 --> 26:40.488
[Whimpers]

26:41.873 --> 26:44.575
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
Oh, God.

26:50.666 --> 26:52.500
Hotch: There's light
coming from above.

26:52.502 --> 26:54.151
Reid: The ceiling's low.
It could be a basement.

26:54.153 --> 26:56.087
What's he doing?

27:00.525 --> 27:02.727
Taunting us.

27:09.101 --> 27:11.636
6 locks on the inside.

27:11.638 --> 27:14.855
He's barricading them in.

27:40.472 --> 27:41.606
We know what he looks like.

27:41.608 --> 27:43.299
We have not found him
in any database yet.

27:43.451 --> 27:45.084
I want all of your agents
to spread out

27:45.085 --> 27:46.785
and comb a 5-mile radius
from the hospital

27:46.787 --> 27:48.870
where Sam Carter was found.

27:48.872 --> 27:50.272
All right.
Yes, sir.

27:50.494 --> 27:52.527
I told the Director
you're doing everything you can.

27:52.529 --> 27:54.329
Do you want me to get
a joint taskforce started?

27:54.331 --> 27:57.148
If Garcia can't shut the site down,
I don't think anybody can.

27:57.150 --> 27:58.516
If this woman dies
on the Internet

27:58.518 --> 28:00.301
and we didn't do everything
in our power to save her--

28:00.303 --> 28:02.303
We've got agents who know
this city best in the field.

28:02.305 --> 28:05.740
My team is doing everything we can.
You do what you have to do.

28:08.277 --> 28:10.245
[Sighs] This guy
doesn't seem to care

28:10.247 --> 28:12.864
that we know what he looks like.
It's like he wants to get caught.

28:12.866 --> 28:13.832
He does.

28:13.834 --> 28:15.667
He waited till
we were all watching

28:15.669 --> 28:17.202
to lobotomize this girl.
Why?

28:17.204 --> 28:19.604
Because he's punishing her,
and he wants everyone to see it.

28:19.606 --> 28:21.289
Morgan: Garcia,
you can't block it?

28:21.291 --> 28:23.725
He's got multiple-core
servers.

28:23.727 --> 28:25.928
Come on, baby girl. I know
you can shut this thing down.

28:25.929 --> 28:28.096
I am trying my hardest.

28:28.098 --> 28:30.382
It is no joke.
It's a premium network

28:30.384 --> 28:32.467
bounced between Germany,
Denmark, Indonesia,

28:32.469 --> 28:35.854
Panama, and the U.S.,
and his firewall is hard-core.

28:35.856 --> 28:38.440
Well, can you at least
figure out the U.S. angle?

28:38.442 --> 28:41.443
I am trying as hard as I can.

28:43.279 --> 28:46.531
Nothing he's doing
has a sexual component,

28:46.533 --> 28:48.066
that we know of, anyway.

28:48.068 --> 28:50.685
If he wanted to kill Sam,
he had every chance to do it,

28:50.687 --> 28:51.987
but instead he let Sam go.

28:51.989 --> 28:54.155
Both of these victims
are significant to him.

28:54.157 --> 28:55.657
It looks like
he's playing a game,

28:55.659 --> 28:57.759
not just with us,
but with all of them.

28:57.761 --> 29:01.379
If it isn't sexual but still
has incredible stakes to him,

29:01.381 --> 29:02.520
maybe it's familial.

29:02.545 --> 29:04.100
I mean, he could be
related to one of them.

29:04.101 --> 29:08.503
He's not just punishing her,
he's torturing her family.

29:26.572 --> 29:28.323
He has her
in a straitjacket.

29:28.325 --> 29:29.658
What's that about?

29:29.660 --> 29:31.743
This message is
personally specific.

29:31.745 --> 29:34.446
She restrained
and emotionally paralyzed.

29:34.448 --> 29:37.999
She's in no condition
to run away.

29:51.630 --> 29:54.966
So those locks
are to keep others out.

29:54.968 --> 29:57.802
Because he's in
another bad area.

29:57.804 --> 30:01.439
Probably close to where
he kept them before.

30:01.441 --> 30:02.643
Garcia, we need the location

30:02.668 --> 30:04.527
of every cell tower where
the signal's bouncing.

30:04.528 --> 30:05.927
That's a lot, sir,
but I'm sending them now.

30:05.929 --> 30:09.948
What about the name Dani?
Does it cross with Sam in any way?

30:09.950 --> 30:13.151
There's a Dana Harris.

30:13.153 --> 30:16.171
It's not Dani,
but he's called Dana Harris

30:16.173 --> 30:17.288
a dozen times,

30:17.290 --> 30:19.874
and she is on a student visa
at Johns Hopkins,

30:19.876 --> 30:21.476
and, oh, my God,
she's from Berlin.

30:21.478 --> 30:24.145
Does she have a connection
to Baltimore other than school?

30:24.147 --> 30:26.831
Digging...Yes, yes.
Her father is a partner

30:26.833 --> 30:28.950
at Strauss and Harris
commercial real estate.

30:28.952 --> 30:30.473
They specialize in converting

30:30.498 --> 30:32.688
warehouses in port cities
all over they world.

30:32.689 --> 30:34.288
They own one
in Northern Baltimore.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.457
And wouldn't you know it?
There's a cell phone tower

30:36.459 --> 30:38.893
right by there that
that signal is bouncing from.

30:38.895 --> 30:39.894
What's the address?

30:39.896 --> 30:42.063
Sending it to your phones now.

30:54.744 --> 30:59.414
[Speaking German]

30:59.416 --> 31:00.832
There she is.
That's definitely Dana.

31:00.834 --> 31:03.151
I've got eyes on her.
She's getting into a white van.

31:06.255 --> 31:07.872
Do we have cross streets?

31:07.874 --> 31:11.209
Not yet. But it looks
like she's in an alley.

31:11.211 --> 31:13.344
Why would he want us
to see where they're going?

31:13.346 --> 31:14.629
Because he's arrogant.

31:14.631 --> 31:16.598
This is the end of his plan
and we're a part of it.

31:16.600 --> 31:19.768
Garcia, we think the unsub
could be related to Sam or Dana.

31:19.770 --> 31:23.438
The Harris family
has a son, Anton, 29.

31:23.440 --> 31:24.773
History of violent outbursts

31:24.775 --> 31:26.975
had him bouncing between
boarding schools all over Europe.

31:26.977 --> 31:28.893
While Dana stayed close to home.

31:28.895 --> 31:30.361
How'd you know?

31:30.363 --> 31:32.847
He blames Dana for his rejection
and abandonment issues.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.149
It's a classic
universal wound.

31:34.151 --> 31:36.017
Left untreated and combined with
the psychopathic urges,

31:36.019 --> 31:37.435
that trauma led
to extreme aggression.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.987
And a desperate need
for attention.

31:38.989 --> 31:42.073
Let me guess, Garcia--
one of the parents is a medical doctor.

31:42.075 --> 31:43.491
Mom was before she died.

31:43.493 --> 31:45.660
It looks like young Anton
was studying to be a veterinarian.

31:45.662 --> 31:48.713
Little sister trumped him
by attending medical school at Hopkins.

31:48.715 --> 31:51.866
He did all this
to get on his parents' radar.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.818
How long has Anton
been in the states?

31:55.154 --> 31:57.205
A month into his 3-month visa.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.152
He waited until Dana

31:58.177 --> 31:59.897
was away from the family
before he attacked.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.811
JJ: All right, we got the van.
It's parked in the alley

32:02.813 --> 32:05.346
behind Greenmount at 25th.

32:20.112 --> 32:22.063
He's gone.

32:41.449 --> 32:43.083
This isn't good.

32:43.752 --> 32:45.611
All right. Let's split up
and search the building.

32:45.612 --> 32:47.112
Cruz, come with me.

33:09.535 --> 33:11.786
Hands where I can see them.

33:11.788 --> 33:13.772
I will if you answer
something.

33:13.774 --> 33:16.975
It doesn't work like that.
Show me your hands.

33:16.977 --> 33:18.827
Hands!

33:18.829 --> 33:21.379
Aren't you the one
who's supposed to ask me

33:21.381 --> 33:22.998
why I do what I do?

33:23.000 --> 33:24.766
I would if I didn't
already know.

33:24.768 --> 33:29.554
You're patient,
but you also take risks.

33:29.556 --> 33:33.224
It's why you leave
nothing to chance.

33:33.226 --> 33:35.226
I wondered why you hadn't
practiced on the eyes

33:35.228 --> 33:36.861
of the man you killed
in Berlin.

33:36.863 --> 33:40.065
It's because you'd already
tried it on yourself.

33:40.067 --> 33:42.851
You're recording
all of this right now,

33:42.853 --> 33:43.949
because you want everyone
out there to know

33:43.974 --> 33:45.401
what it's like to be you.

33:45.939 --> 33:47.973
Maybe they'll understand.

33:47.975 --> 33:50.158
Maybe they'll even
feel sorry for you.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.493
But they won't.

33:51.495 --> 33:53.278
Because we've intercepted
your transmission

33:53.280 --> 33:54.946
and shut it down.

34:01.921 --> 34:03.788
Go ahead, see for yourself.

34:09.462 --> 34:11.513
So they aren't
watching me anymore.

34:11.514 --> 34:13.982
What else is new?

34:13.984 --> 34:17.802
My father sent me away
because I humiliated him.

34:17.804 --> 34:20.005
He said I brought shame
to our family.

34:20.007 --> 34:21.906
Your father sent you away
because you're sick

34:21.908 --> 34:23.491
and he wanted to protect Dana.

34:23.493 --> 34:26.962
He was right.
But he couldn't stop me.

34:26.964 --> 34:30.165
Your father's on his way.
But of course you knew that.

34:30.167 --> 34:33.735
That's why you showed
everyone your face.

34:33.737 --> 34:36.204
You wanted him to know
that you'd won.

34:36.206 --> 34:37.755
And it worked.

34:37.757 --> 34:39.873
But you have to admit,

34:39.876 --> 34:42.744
what I've done
is extraordinary.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.946
My father
will never forget it.

34:44.947 --> 34:47.565
Certainly Dana won't.

34:47.567 --> 34:49.434
Or maybe she will.

34:49.436 --> 34:50.668
Will you?

34:50.670 --> 34:52.337
I already have.

34:52.339 --> 34:53.638
Cuff him.

35:11.190 --> 35:14.943
Garcia didn't shut down
his signal, did she?

35:14.945 --> 35:16.895
Well, he didn't know that.

35:18.364 --> 35:21.833
I can see why they didn't
want you out of the field.

35:24.537 --> 35:27.422
Yes, sir, right away.
Get her on now!

35:37.316 --> 35:40.435
[Cell phone rings]

35:40.437 --> 35:41.603
Cruz.

35:43.105 --> 35:45.273
Copy that.

35:46.108 --> 35:48.843
He's driving back with us.

35:56.619 --> 35:59.287
You're getting stronger.

35:59.289 --> 36:01.706
I knew you would.

36:01.708 --> 36:03.408
Can you guys
hold up for a second?

36:03.410 --> 36:04.793
Yes, sir.

36:08.130 --> 36:10.865
Hey, Dana. I'm Derek.

36:10.867 --> 36:14.002
Sam here is very happy
to see you.

36:19.725 --> 36:22.260
D-Dana.

36:42.064 --> 36:44.599
Dr. Hoshino:
Her vitals are strong.

36:44.601 --> 36:46.618
I should have her back
in an hour.

36:46.620 --> 36:50.004
You want to go with
her, don't you, Sam?

36:50.006 --> 36:52.290
Yes.

36:54.176 --> 36:56.211
You got it.

37:08.974 --> 37:10.809
They gonna be ok?

37:11.644 --> 37:13.228
Maybe.

37:13.230 --> 37:15.196
Eventually.

37:15.198 --> 37:18.750
Worst case of sibling rivalry
I've ever seen.

37:18.752 --> 37:20.869
Yeah.

37:35.084 --> 37:37.418
Do you have kids?

37:37.420 --> 37:39.170
No.

37:40.589 --> 37:42.891
Do you?

37:42.893 --> 37:44.008
Yes.

37:44.010 --> 37:46.227
My father named me Anton

37:46.229 --> 37:49.347
because it means
"invaluable."

37:49.349 --> 37:52.150
Do you think
he ever believed that?

37:52.152 --> 37:54.435
Why don't you ask him?

37:54.437 --> 37:56.654
I will.

38:02.862 --> 38:04.162
You sure about that?

38:04.164 --> 38:06.948
Absolutely. Come on,
it's not a problem.

38:22.014 --> 38:24.665
Hotch: "Death is not
the greatest loss in life.

38:24.667 --> 38:28.720
The greatest loss is what dies
inside of us while we live."

38:28.722 --> 38:30.504
Norman Cousins.

38:32.191 --> 38:34.809
[Knock on door]

38:35.861 --> 38:38.196
Mr. Harris has
diplomatic connections

38:38.198 --> 38:40.982
and wanted to have
Anton extradited.

38:40.984 --> 38:44.702
After all that he's still trying
to protect him.

38:44.704 --> 38:46.871
Tell me you didn't
let that happen.

38:46.873 --> 38:48.706
I called in a favor
from the State Department.

38:48.708 --> 38:50.825
He's being charged
and tried right here.

38:50.827 --> 38:53.077
Good.

38:54.580 --> 38:56.314
You got a good team.

38:56.316 --> 38:59.300
We do.

39:01.921 --> 39:04.422
Welcome.

39:04.424 --> 39:07.208
Thanks.

39:13.849 --> 39:15.716
You always here
this late?

39:16.819 --> 39:18.770
Pretty much, yeah.

39:18.772 --> 39:20.989
Every time your name
was mentioned today

39:20.991 --> 39:24.075
and every time I didn't say,
hey, yeah, I know him, I'm lying.

39:24.077 --> 39:27.362
I know it's not easy.
I don't like it either.

39:27.364 --> 39:30.431
We're surrounded
by profilers, Matt.

39:30.433 --> 39:33.151
One side glance and they're
gonna figure it all out.

39:33.153 --> 39:35.069
Well, separating us
in the field was smart.

39:35.071 --> 39:36.454
It was the only way.

39:36.456 --> 39:38.906
Look, I--I know why
we can't tell them.

39:38.908 --> 39:40.425
I get that, but...

39:40.427 --> 39:43.795
We can't have too many
of these conversations either.

39:43.797 --> 39:46.798
That case could stay open
for a couple years.

39:46.800 --> 39:49.183
It's already been
almost 3.

39:50.052 --> 39:53.438
Did you take this
position because of me?

39:53.440 --> 39:55.189
No.

39:55.191 --> 39:58.693
Trust me, I walked into
the Hoover building this morning

39:58.695 --> 40:01.112
and was told to drive
out to Quantico immediately.

40:01.114 --> 40:04.265
So someone put this
transfer on the fast track.

40:04.267 --> 40:05.533
State?

40:05.535 --> 40:07.118
They wouldn't admit it
if they did.

40:07.120 --> 40:08.369
True.

40:08.371 --> 40:13.241
This, um...us...

40:13.243 --> 40:15.460
We're good, right?

40:16.945 --> 40:18.563
Yeah.

40:18.565 --> 40:20.498
Ok.

40:21.717 --> 40:24.268
You want to meet at the
Air and Space in the morning,

40:24.270 --> 40:25.970
run some sprints?

40:25.972 --> 40:29.724
I'm going to make breakfast
for my boys.

40:29.726 --> 40:31.426
Great plan.

40:39.435 --> 40:40.902
Going home?

40:40.904 --> 40:41.903
Yeah.

40:41.905 --> 40:42.854
Cruz?

40:42.856 --> 40:44.856
I've got some work
to do. Good night.

40:44.858 --> 40:45.823
JJ: Good night.

40:45.825 --> 40:47.475
Good night.
Cruz: Good night.

40:53.916 --> 40:56.250
You good?

40:56.252 --> 40:59.203
Yeah. All good.
