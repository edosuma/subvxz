Our undergrad
student body at brown

01:42.035 --> 01:44.037
only numbers
about 6, 000 people.

01:44.537 --> 01:46.039
That's from every state
in this country

01:46.039 --> 01:49.042
and from over 60 countries
in the world.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.044
Admission is
extremely selective.

01:51.044 --> 01:54.047
So, again, get all
of your academic

01:54.047 --> 01:56.549
and extracurricular
ducks in a row.

01:56.549 --> 01:58.551
Leave nothing to chance.

02:05.558 --> 02:08.061
Hey, buddy.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.562
Davie.

02:09.562 --> 02:11.564
Saw your wife
out there alone.

02:11.564 --> 02:13.066
I figured you
for the trotters.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.067
Not tonight.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.069
Had a customer
i couldn't shake.

02:16.569 --> 02:18.571
Guy spends a half hour
deciding between

02:18.571 --> 02:20.573
a $20 soccer ball
and a $22 soccer ball.

02:21.074 --> 02:24.077
So, who do you like?

02:24.077 --> 02:25.578
I don't know.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.580
That guy from bowdoin seems to
be making some sense, i guess.

02:27.580 --> 02:30.083
No, i mean
the game tonight.

02:30.583 --> 02:31.584
Whoa!

02:31.584 --> 02:34.087
You guys want
to be alone?

02:34.087 --> 02:36.089
I saw that refreshment
table out there.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.091
I knew you'd be lurkin
g around here somewhere.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.093
I don't know how i always
get roped into this shit.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.594
Charmaine's no fool.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.096
She's knows one of your
shfooyadell in the right mouth

02:43.096 --> 02:44.597
and her daughter can go
anywhere she wants to go.

02:44.597 --> 02:46.599
So far, the janitor's
the only one going near them.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.602
Well, that's a nice
career path for a young lady.

02:49.602 --> 02:51.104
Fuck you.

02:51.604 --> 02:53.106
I want to go get one
of them belly bombs.

02:53.606 --> 02:56.109
Have i said
"fuck you" yet?

03:01.114 --> 03:02.615
Freakin' delicious, artie.

03:02.615 --> 03:04.117
Glad i didn't
eat tonight.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.118
Thanks, davie.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.120
It's nice to be appreciated
by your friends.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.122
Oh, the sensitive chef.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.623
Hey, eric,
they all done?

03:10.623 --> 03:12.125
Yeah, i guess.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.626
Um, dad,
can i have 20 bucks?

03:13.626 --> 03:15.128
Are you like this?

03:15.128 --> 03:16.629
What, did you think
he was coming over to say,

03:17.130 --> 03:18.131
"gee, dad, thanks for
taking the time

03:18.631 --> 03:20.133
to come to
this important event."

03:20.133 --> 03:21.134
Ha, ha.

03:21.134 --> 03:22.635
How you doing, eric?

03:22.635 --> 03:23.636
Pretty good,
mr. Soprano.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.138
You guys want
something to eat?

03:25.138 --> 03:27.140
Ah, no, we're going
to starbucks.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.642
I hear you're thinking
of going to brown, right?

03:29.642 --> 03:31.644
Yeah, it's a good school.

03:31.644 --> 03:33.146
Lot of star fucking,
though.

03:33.146 --> 03:34.647
Hey, latrine lip...

03:34.647 --> 03:36.149
he's right.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.650
This jamoke'll go
wherever his mother tells him.

03:37.650 --> 03:38.151
No different than
his old man.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.152
You, too?

03:39.152 --> 03:40.653
You know, in high school,

03:40.653 --> 03:42.155
these guys were like
joe namath and y. A. Tittle.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.656
Yeah, i've heard.

03:43.656 --> 03:52.165
And now, they're like
phil donahue and alan alda.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.166
Listen, uh...

03:53.666 --> 03:54.667
i heard through
the grapevine

03:54.667 --> 03:56.169
that you're taking over
your uncle's game.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.171
You know,
the big one.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.173
Grapevine.

04:00.173 --> 04:01.174
Yeah.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.176
You know, if you listen
close to that song,

04:03.176 --> 04:05.178
it says believe none of
what you hear and a
half of what you see.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.180
No, it's just,
you know me...

04:07.180 --> 04:08.181
i like to play a little.

04:08.681 --> 04:09.182
A little.

04:09.682 --> 04:10.683
Forget it.

04:10.683 --> 04:12.185
This game'
s not for you.

04:12.185 --> 04:15.188
No, it's just, you know, i was
thinking it would be a kick.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.190
David.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.692
You're a nice guy,
i like you, okay.

04:19.692 --> 04:21.694
But trust me,
this game's not for you.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.696
I don't want to
see you get hurt.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.698
These guys,
they play deep.

04:25.698 --> 04:29.702
You know how many jockstraps
i sold last week.

04:29.702 --> 04:31.704
Not enough for
this game, okay.

04:31.704 --> 04:32.705
Forget it.

04:33.206 --> 04:34.707
C'mon.

04:34.707 --> 04:42.215
Let's go see what the wayo
from bucknell's got to say.

04:42.215 --> 04:44.217
Do you want to tell me
what you're thinking?

04:44.217 --> 04:47.720
Believe me, you don't
want to know.

04:54.227 --> 04:56.229
You want to know
what i'm thinking?

04:56.229 --> 04:57.730
Seriously?

04:57.730 --> 05:00.233
I'm thinking i'd like
to take a brick

05:00.233 --> 05:02.235
and smash your fucking face
into fucking hamburger.

05:02.735 --> 05:05.738
Okay.

05:05.738 --> 05:09.242
I'm not--

05:09.242 --> 05:11.744
don't worry.

05:11.744 --> 05:18.751
I know i broke your
coffee table and it's
not gonna happen again.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.753
You asked, i told.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.755
But you'd like to
smash my face.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.257
Not really.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.759
It's just the way of
describing how i'm feeling.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.262
Do you think making
hamburger out of me

05:29.262 --> 05:30.263
would make you
feel better?

05:30.263 --> 05:31.764
Mother of christ,
is this a woman thing?

05:31.764 --> 05:33.266
You asked me
how i'm feeling.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.268
I tell you
how i'm feeling.

05:35.768 --> 05:37.270
And now, you're gonna
torture me with it.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.272
I don't know who
the fuck i'm angry at.

05:39.272 --> 05:46.279
I'm just angry, okay.

05:46.279 --> 05:47.280
Why the fuck
am i here?

05:47.780 --> 05:49.782
I even asked
to come back.

05:49.782 --> 05:51.284
I got the world
by the balls

05:51.284 --> 05:53.286
and i can't stop feeling
like i'm a fucking loser.

05:53.286 --> 05:55.788
Who makes you feel like
a loser, your mother?

05:56.289 --> 05:58.291
Oh, please, we wasted
enough oxygen on that one.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.294
It's everythin
g and everybody.

06:01.294 --> 06:04.797
I see some guy walking
down the street,

06:04.797 --> 06:05.798
you know,
with a clear head.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.800
You know the type.

06:07.800 --> 06:09.802
He's always fucking
whistling like the
happy fucking wanderer.

06:09.802 --> 06:11.304
I just want to
go up to him

06:11.304 --> 06:12.805
and i just want to
rip his throat open.

06:13.306 --> 06:14.807
I want to fucking
grab him and pummel him

06:14.807 --> 06:17.310
right there for
no reason.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.313
Why should i give a shit
if a guy's got a clear head?

06:20.813 --> 06:22.315
I should say "a salut",
good for you.

06:22.315 --> 06:25.818
Let's get back to
smashing my face.

06:25.818 --> 06:27.320
Jesus christ.

06:27.320 --> 06:28.821
Oh!

06:28.821 --> 06:35.828
No, i think it
all ties in.

06:36.329 --> 06:37.330
Alright.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.832
Sometimes i resent you
making me a victim,

06:39.832 --> 06:41.334
that's all.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.336
I make you feel
like a victim.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.337
Yeah.

06:44.837 --> 06:45.838
Remember the first
time i came here?

06:45.838 --> 06:49.342
I said the kind of man
i admire is gary cooper,

06:49.342 --> 06:50.843
the strong, silent type.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.845
And how all americans,

06:52.845 --> 06:55.348
all they're doing is crying
and confessing and complaining.

06:55.348 --> 06:56.849
A bunch of
fucking pussies.

06:56.849 --> 06:58.351
Fuck'em!

06:58.351 --> 07:00.353
And now, i'm one of them,
a patient.

07:00.353 --> 07:03.356
Your parents made it impossible
for you to experience joy.

07:03.356 --> 07:04.857
Yeah, see,
there you go again.

07:04.857 --> 07:07.360
You said yourself you're
not the happy wanderer.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.362
Well, i'm more like
one of those assholes

07:09.362 --> 07:11.364
than i am the fucking
jerkoffs and douchebags

07:11.364 --> 07:14.867
i see leaving this office.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.370
Stop with the faces already,
what do you got?

07:17.370 --> 07:19.372
Three eights full.

07:19.372 --> 07:20.373
Santa maria, yes!

07:20.873 --> 07:21.874
Santa maria.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.876
More like fucking
santa claus.

07:23.876 --> 07:24.877
Did you cut the pot?

07:24.877 --> 07:25.878
Twice.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.380
Here.

07:27.380 --> 07:29.382
Make sure you spend it in
my restaurant, you prick.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.383
One chip.

07:30.883 --> 07:32.385
Ah, va'napola.

07:32.385 --> 07:33.886
He can't even buy
mcdonalds with that.

07:33.886 --> 07:34.887
No, no, that's it,
i got to go.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.389
Oh, c'mon, artie,
another hour.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.890
I can't.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.392
Charmaine'll have my balls
on the menu tomorrow.

07:39.392 --> 07:40.393
Cash me out.

07:40.893 --> 07:41.894
Look at all the money.

07:41.894 --> 07:43.396
Hey, rich,
can i get another dime?

07:43.396 --> 07:44.897
We only got
three players left.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.399
So, what,
vito's up for it, right?

07:46.399 --> 07:48.401
Where the fuck
do i got to be?

07:48.901 --> 07:49.402
Only...

07:49.402 --> 07:50.903
let's up the ante.

07:51.404 --> 07:52.905
Are you sure?

07:52.905 --> 07:54.407
You're into me for
seven g's already.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.908
Is that all?

07:55.908 --> 07:56.909
I'll make that back
from vito in an hour.

07:57.410 --> 08:03.916
Count this chooch
out another dime.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.448
Well...

08:36.948 --> 08:37.950
we have our work
cut out for us.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.952
Gudren?

08:58.471 --> 08:59.472
Meadow.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.974
I'd like to talk to
you for a second.

09:01.974 --> 09:04.977
It's really sounding
pretty good.

09:04.977 --> 09:06.979
I know you're
disappointed, but...

09:06.979 --> 09:08.481
it's just when you try
out for cabaret night,

09:08.481 --> 09:09.982
the form asked,
what you want to do,

09:09.982 --> 09:11.484
and i checked off solo.

09:11.484 --> 09:12.485
You're seniors.

09:12.485 --> 09:14.487
This is your last
chance at cabaret.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.489
Gudren hasn't had
a solo in four years here.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.990
I'd like to give
everybody a shot.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.494
Mrs. Gaetano, i was a sophomore
when i did "spider woman".

09:21.994 --> 09:28.000
Now, it's important
because of college and all.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.001
You okay with this?

09:29.001 --> 09:30.503
Do i have a choice?

09:30.503 --> 09:31.504
Yeah, you got a choice.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.005
You can continue
to run the game.

09:33.005 --> 09:36.509
You know i'm under fucking
house arrest, you cute fuck.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.511
Then take the bite
i give you and be happy.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.514
Either way, i'm having
the executive game.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.516
You know, your father and me
started that game

09:43.516 --> 09:45.017
over 30 years ago.

09:45.017 --> 09:47.520
We were talking one day about
how the credit card companies,

09:47.520 --> 09:49.522
you know,
they work their angle.

09:49.522 --> 09:51.023
They didn't care
what the fuck you bought

09:51.524 --> 09:53.025
as long as you didn't
pay all at once.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.527
They juice you to death.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.529
And you thank them for letting
you have a card.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.531
You'd rather be juiced
then pay all at once.

09:59.031 --> 10:01.033
That's a certain
kind of player.

10:01.033 --> 10:04.036
That's why we call it
the executive game.

10:04.036 --> 10:06.539
My brother, johnny,
was one keen motherfucker.

10:06.539 --> 10:10.543
Oh, yeah, that's why he
left us with chi- chi beans.

10:10.543 --> 10:12.545
You don't know what
you're talking about.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.548
Your father left livia
with a fuckin' package

10:15.548 --> 10:17.550
that could choke
a fucking elephant.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.552
I got to tell you?

10:19.552 --> 10:22.555
She's like a woman with
a virginia ham under her arm,

10:22.555 --> 10:25.057
crying the blues
'cause she has no bread.

10:25.057 --> 10:26.058
Please...

10:26.559 --> 10:28.561
they don't make'em
like johnny.

10:29.061 --> 10:30.563
And keep in mind that
he paid the freight

10:30.563 --> 10:31.564
for your uncle eckley.

10:31.564 --> 10:34.066
That was a major
fucking nut.

10:34.066 --> 10:35.067
Who?

10:35.067 --> 10:36.569
Who the fuck is eckle?

10:36.569 --> 10:37.570
Forget it.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.071
Keep thinking
you know everything.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.073
Some people are so far
behind in the race

10:41.574 --> 10:43.075
that they actually
believe they're leading.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.076
Yeah, that's cute.

10:44.076 --> 10:45.578
Who the fuck is eckle?

10:45.578 --> 10:46.579
Eckley, eckley.

10:46.579 --> 10:48.080
Let's talk about
something else.

10:48.080 --> 10:49.582
No, you opened this clam,
my friend.

10:49.582 --> 10:50.583
Who is he?

10:50.583 --> 10:51.584
You don't know him.

10:52.084 --> 10:53.085
It's water
under the bridge.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.588
Just know that me and your
father looked out for him.

10:55.588 --> 10:57.089
He wanted
for nothing.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.090
Fuck you, fuck eckle.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.592
I don't got time
for this shit.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.093
He was my younger brother.

11:01.093 --> 11:02.595
He was between me
and your father in age.

11:03.095 --> 11:03.596
His name was eckley.

11:03.596 --> 11:07.600
Actually, ercoli-- hercules.

11:07.600 --> 11:12.605
Named after
my grandfather.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.106
What are you saying?

11:14.607 --> 11:16.609
I got another uncle?

11:16.609 --> 11:18.110
Sharp as a fucking
cue ball.

11:18.611 --> 11:20.112
Yeah, i'm saying.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.614
Your father and
me had a brother you
didn't know about.

11:22.114 --> 11:27.119
'Cause he was...

11:27.119 --> 11:29.121
it was different
in those days.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.624
Mother and father didn't
even speak the language.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.626
They couldn't take
care of a kid like that.

11:33.626 --> 11:37.129
God bless your grandmother.

11:37.129 --> 11:41.133
She went to every charity home
in this fucking state

11:41.133 --> 11:44.136
till she found one
that she felt would
take good care of him.

11:44.136 --> 11:45.638
What are you saying,
he was retarded?

11:45.638 --> 11:47.640
Why don't you
go fuck yourself.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.642
He was slow.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.645
He was strong
as a fucking bull,
handsome like george raft.

11:52.645 --> 11:56.148
If it was today, they migh
t have trained him to be a...

11:56.148 --> 11:58.651
whatever or something.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.152
Get him a job.

12:00.152 --> 12:03.656
They didn't understand
these things back then.

12:03.656 --> 12:06.158
Jesus.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.661
What were we thinking?

12:09.161 --> 12:10.663
Un- fucking- believable.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.165
I remember my mother
and my father arguing about--

12:13.165 --> 12:14.667
something, i don't know.

12:14.667 --> 12:16.168
And, uh...

12:16.168 --> 12:20.172
she kept talking about my
father's feeble- minded brother,

12:20.172 --> 12:24.677
but i always thought
she meant you.

12:24.677 --> 12:28.180
What a kick
in the balls.

12:28.180 --> 12:30.182
When did he die?

12:30.182 --> 12:31.684
Not long before
your father.

12:32.184 --> 12:35.187
Past is the past,
this is the present.

12:35.187 --> 12:37.189
Let's talk about
this game.

12:37.189 --> 12:38.691
What's my end?

12:38.691 --> 12:41.193
I don't know.

12:41.193 --> 12:42.194
Ten percent.

12:42.695 --> 12:43.696
20.

12:43.696 --> 12:46.198
15.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.200
Call your friends.

12:48.701 --> 12:51.704
Let them know
the game's happening.

13:03.215 --> 13:05.217
Can i help you
with something, sir?

13:05.217 --> 13:07.720
Yeah, i want to buy
a boat with three propellers.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.722
What?

13:09.722 --> 13:12.224
Kid, you see m
e here every week.

13:12.224 --> 13:14.226
When are you
gonna stop asking?

13:14.226 --> 13:15.728
Ho, rich.

13:15.728 --> 13:18.230
There a problem?

13:18.230 --> 13:21.233
No, i'm just breaking
your kid's balls.

13:27.740 --> 13:31.243
Like the pimp says to his'hos,
"keep'em coming."

13:31.243 --> 13:32.244
Hey, rich.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.246
That envelope's
two c shy.

13:34.246 --> 13:35.748
I'll catch up on
it next week.

13:35.748 --> 13:37.249
It's no problem.

13:37.249 --> 13:39.251
I just got caught a little
off guard this month.

13:39.251 --> 13:40.252
You know, i took
a second on the house,

13:40.252 --> 13:42.254
didn't calculate
into my budget.

13:42.254 --> 13:43.255
No biggie.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.256
No good, davie.

13:44.256 --> 13:45.257
It's just a stutter step.

13:45.257 --> 13:46.759
Like i said,
it's no biggie.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.260
The difference gets
tacked onto the principle.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.262
And you know that.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.764
Yeah, i understand.

13:51.764 --> 13:54.266
Don't take
this personally.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.770
But i don't want to see
your face at any of my games

13:57.770 --> 13:59.772
until you're caught up.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.273
C'mon, rich,
that's not necessary.

14:01.774 --> 14:04.777
Kid, you think i started
this life ten minutes ago?

14:04.777 --> 14:07.279
A guy hands you
a light envelope,

14:07.279 --> 14:11.283
it's just the beginning,
nothing personal.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.285
Yeah, i know,
but it's just this week--

14:13.285 --> 14:14.286
i know.

14:14.286 --> 14:16.288
It's just a stutter step.

14:24.296 --> 14:25.798
What kind is that?

14:25.798 --> 14:26.799
Brazilian snapper.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.300
Is it fishy?

14:28.300 --> 14:29.301
It's fish.

14:29.802 --> 14:30.803
You know what i mean.

14:30.803 --> 14:31.303
It's for pizziola.

14:31.804 --> 14:36.809
Let me smell it.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.310
You want something
or what?

14:38.310 --> 14:40.813
Yeah, give me some of that,
enough for 15 people,

14:40.813 --> 14:42.314
10 pounds of shrimp.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.823
It's gonna be some
serious money there.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.325
This is no
nickel- and- dime shit.

14:53.325 --> 14:56.829
These motherfuckers
can play for two
days straight sometimes.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.330
Now, once you start work,

14:58.831 --> 15:00.833
you don't go till
the game breaks up

15:00.833 --> 15:03.836
and that fucking place looks
like an operating room.

15:03.836 --> 15:08.340
You mean, we're like
cleaning guys.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.342
Oh, what the fuck
are you doing?

15:10.843 --> 15:11.844
Something ain't right.

15:11.844 --> 15:13.345
Fucking "a".

15:13.345 --> 15:14.847
I just saw you put
your finger on the scale.

15:14.847 --> 15:15.848
No, i didn't.

15:16.348 --> 15:16.849
You pull that shit with
the old ladies, not with me,

15:16.849 --> 15:18.350
you fucking hump.

15:18.350 --> 15:19.351
I didn't put my finger
on the scale.

15:19.852 --> 15:21.353
I don't believe this shit.

15:21.854 --> 15:22.855
Where are you going?

15:22.855 --> 15:23.856
Wrap that up.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.357
I got to weigh it.

15:25.357 --> 15:25.858
You got to what?

15:26.358 --> 15:33.365
You got to rob me.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.869
Yeah, you serve some booze,
empty the ashtrays.

15:36.869 --> 15:38.871
Oh, oh, that reminds me.

15:38.871 --> 15:42.374
Whatever you do, don't engage
silvio in conversation.

15:42.374 --> 15:44.877
He can be a sick fuck
when he's gambling.

15:44.877 --> 15:46.879
One night, he was
down like 50 large.

15:46.879 --> 15:50.883
At some point he sneezes,
fritzi says "salut".

15:50.883 --> 15:52.384
Fritzi neste
from hoboken?

15:52.384 --> 15:53.385
Yeah, you know him?

15:53.385 --> 15:54.887
No--

15:54.887 --> 15:56.388
then shut the fuck up
and let me finish, alright.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.890
Anyway, fritzi says,"salut",

15:57.890 --> 15:59.892
silvio thinks he says
something else,

15:59.892 --> 16:00.893
forget it.

16:00.893 --> 16:01.894
For the rest of the night,

16:01.894 --> 16:04.396
silvio's blaming fritz
i for his losing streak,

16:04.396 --> 16:05.397
the fucking nut.

16:05.397 --> 16:06.398
What do you
think he said?

16:06.899 --> 16:07.900
Are you listening
to me or what?

16:07.900 --> 16:12.905
He's a fucking nut,
who knows?

16:12.905 --> 16:14.406
Here.

16:14.406 --> 16:17.409
But i didn't put my finger
on no fucking scale.

16:17.409 --> 16:20.913
Put that shit in the trunk
so it don't stink up the car.

16:20.913 --> 16:25.918
Pay for the fish.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.419
This guy for real
or what?

16:27.419 --> 16:28.921
What, are we
fucking piss boys?

16:28.921 --> 16:31.423
C'mon, let's get
the fuck out of here.

16:48.941 --> 16:52.444
We want the room with
the stove and the refrigerator.

16:52.444 --> 16:55.447
The efficiencies have been
booked to paying customers.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.449
Muovono.

16:57.449 --> 16:58.951
And the two rooms
on the sides.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.452
We may be here
for some days.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.954
You people are ruining
this place.

17:02.454 --> 17:03.455
That's your father fault.

17:03.455 --> 17:04.957
He made it
a business deal.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.459
We want a lot
of clean towels

17:07.459 --> 17:09.962
and the bathroom's
fresh- smelling.

17:10.462 --> 17:14.465
I should work
for nothing?

17:14.465 --> 17:18.971
Guernica.

17:19.471 --> 17:21.973
You ever
suck his dick?

17:21.973 --> 17:27.980
I make that beanie spi
n when i work his thing.

17:27.980 --> 17:33.485
Am i right?

17:33.485 --> 17:38.991
Don't bitch to me.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.014
What do you hear?
What do you say?

18:02.014 --> 18:05.517
License and registration.

18:05.517 --> 18:07.519
How about if i give you
one of these instead.

18:07.519 --> 18:08.520
I'm wearing a vest.

18:08.520 --> 18:10.022
Oh, yeah?

18:10.022 --> 18:12.024
If i shoot,
it's going in your brajol.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.526
You're a real sick fuck,
you know that?

18:16.028 --> 18:17.529
Danny boy.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.531
How's your family?

18:20.032 --> 18:21.033
Not bad, paulie.

18:21.033 --> 18:23.535
We had to move my father
to another old folks' home--

18:23.535 --> 18:26.538
hey, i got my own
fucking problems.

18:26.538 --> 18:29.041
You're a fucking hard- on,
you know that?

18:29.041 --> 18:31.043
How many times am
i gonna fall for that?

18:31.043 --> 18:32.544
Here.

18:33.045 --> 18:35.047
Hey, listen,
do me a favor, alright.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.049
Your friends,
players or no,

18:37.549 --> 18:40.052
they don't fuck
with the tourists

18:40.052 --> 18:41.053
and the hotel guests,

18:41.553 --> 18:42.554
keep the noise down
and no gunshots

18:43.055 --> 18:44.056
or we got to
take the call.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.057
Yeah, yeah.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.060
Go play cops
and robbers.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.061
Make it four.

18:49.061 --> 18:50.062
Change coming.

18:50.062 --> 18:53.065
To you.

18:53.065 --> 18:54.566
Mike.

18:54.566 --> 18:55.567
Hey, mike!

18:55.567 --> 18:56.568
Matt.

18:56.568 --> 18:59.571
Tony wants you.

18:59.571 --> 19:00.572
Yeah, t.

19:00.572 --> 19:02.574
Tony.

19:02.574 --> 19:03.575
You got the macanudos?

19:03.575 --> 19:04.576
Yeah, you want one?

19:05.077 --> 19:06.578
Yeah, give one to me
and one to dr. Fried.

19:06.578 --> 19:07.579
Alright.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.086
Alright, gentlemen, frank.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.087
Yeah, i'm in.

19:15.587 --> 19:19.091
Me, too.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.092
Thanks.

19:20.092 --> 19:22.094
$400 to you, sil.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.096
What's in the pot?

19:24.096 --> 19:28.600
About $2400.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.102
Too early to chase
an inside straight.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.103
Doc.

19:31.103 --> 19:35.107
Call'em.

19:35.607 --> 19:36.608
Macanudos,
you want one?

19:36.608 --> 19:38.110
Go ahead,
take a walk.

19:38.110 --> 19:39.111
Don't let him scare you.

19:39.111 --> 19:41.113
He's not really
a nasty fuck.

19:41.113 --> 19:43.115
He's an incredibly
nasty fuck.

19:43.615 --> 19:44.616
Hey, chair boy
of the board,

19:44.616 --> 19:46.618
read your
fucking cards.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.120
$400 to you, john.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.622
Shakespeare
straightening out.

19:50.622 --> 19:52.624
Paulie doesn't
have shit as usual.

19:52.624 --> 19:56.628
And the prick doctor
may be flushing.

19:56.628 --> 19:58.630
Put the tv trays out,
one between two players.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.632
And put some of
this shit on them.

20:00.632 --> 20:03.635
Don't give anybody booze unless
they ask for it, alright?

20:03.635 --> 20:09.641
Okay.

20:09.641 --> 20:10.142
Yeah.

20:10.642 --> 20:11.143
I heard tony was here.

20:11.143 --> 20:12.144
Soprano.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.145
I'm a friend of his.

20:13.145 --> 20:13.645
Do i know you?

20:14.146 --> 20:15.147
Yeah, you know me.

20:15.647 --> 20:19.651
I own "ramsey's sports
and outdoor".

20:19.651 --> 20:20.652
Doc.

20:20.652 --> 20:23.155
And you, sir.

20:33.665 --> 20:34.666
Davie.

20:34.666 --> 20:35.667
What the hell
you doing here?

20:35.667 --> 20:36.668
Hey, i was just driving by,

20:37.169 --> 20:39.171
i thought i'd stop
and say hello.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.672
Some place
you got here.

20:40.672 --> 20:42.674
Yeah, regular taj mahal.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.676
So, have you heard
the kids, not bad?

20:44.676 --> 20:46.178
Bad enough carmela
dragged me to that play.

20:46.178 --> 20:48.180
If i never hear
that song again,
it'll be too soon.

20:48.180 --> 20:50.182
The only area eric's light
in is the arts.

20:50.182 --> 20:52.184
This performance stuff's gonna
put him over the goal line.

20:52.184 --> 20:56.688
Most schools
he's applying to.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.690
So, what's the game?

20:58.690 --> 21:00.192
7 card.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.693
Was that frank sinatra, jr.
In there?

21:01.693 --> 21:02.694
Yeah.

21:02.694 --> 21:04.196
He's a friend
of my uncle's.

21:04.196 --> 21:05.197
He flies in.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.699
Wow, this really i
s an executive game.

21:07.699 --> 21:10.202
So, what do you think?

21:10.202 --> 21:11.703
There's a resemblance.

21:11.703 --> 21:13.205
No, no, no,
i mean the game.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.706
You think i can take
these guys or what?

21:14.706 --> 21:15.707
Davie.

21:15.707 --> 21:17.209
This isn't
a game for you.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.710
Oh, c'mon.

21:18.710 --> 21:19.711
What are the chances of me
getting close to a game

21:19.711 --> 21:20.712
like this again?

21:20.712 --> 21:22.214
C'mon, anthony,
let me sit in just once.

21:22.214 --> 21:23.715
I don't do business
with outside friends,

21:23.715 --> 21:25.217
you understand.

21:25.217 --> 21:27.219
Hey, do i have to show
your high school prom picture

21:27.219 --> 21:28.220
to these guys?

21:28.220 --> 21:29.721
All kidding aside,

21:29.721 --> 21:32.224
i appreciate your position, but
c'mon, tony, i'm a big boy.

21:32.224 --> 21:33.725
What are you holding?

21:33.725 --> 21:35.227
I didn't really
expect to gamble tonight.

21:35.227 --> 21:36.728
You need five g's
just to sit in this game.

21:36.728 --> 21:38.230
Oh, c'mon,
can't you float me?

21:38.230 --> 21:39.731
You know, short term.

21:39.731 --> 21:42.234
Davie, don't say short
if you don't mean short.

21:42.234 --> 21:44.236
All kidding aside.

21:44.736 --> 21:46.238
You understand
what i'm sayin' to you?

21:46.238 --> 21:47.739
Yeah, of course.

21:47.739 --> 21:50.742
Hey, you don't have to
explain business to me.

21:57.749 --> 21:59.751
I got no business
in this game.

21:59.751 --> 22:03.755
$800.

22:03.755 --> 22:05.257
Christopher.

22:05.257 --> 22:07.259
Say hello to
davie scatino.

22:07.259 --> 22:08.260
How you doing?

22:08.260 --> 22:09.761
Give him five
boxes of ziti.

22:09.761 --> 22:13.265
Good luck.

22:13.265 --> 22:14.766
Okay, fella's,
make room.

22:14.766 --> 22:18.270
New blood coming in.

22:24.776 --> 22:27.279
So, there's a lot of money
in sporting goods, huh.

22:27.279 --> 22:28.780
Yeah, frank,
but i tell you, you know,

22:28.780 --> 22:31.783
nike has its stores,
the nba has its own stores.

22:31.783 --> 22:32.784
It cuts in.

22:32.784 --> 22:34.286
It's just
temporary though.

22:34.786 --> 22:37.289
I got some ideas
for next year.

22:37.289 --> 22:39.791
Hey, davie, ask the do
c what his specialty is.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.793
Hard- ons.

22:41.793 --> 22:43.295
I wanted him to ask.

22:43.795 --> 22:44.796
Really?

22:44.796 --> 22:45.797
Penile implants.

22:45.797 --> 22:46.798
Hey, doc.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.300
Please, i've heard
all the jokes.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.301
Pot's right.

22:49.801 --> 22:51.303
Sixth street,
here we come.

22:51.303 --> 22:53.305
No help.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.307
Mysteries abound.

22:55.307 --> 22:57.309
Shut the fuck up
and deal, will you.

22:57.309 --> 22:59.311
Nine of spades,
thank you.

22:59.311 --> 23:01.313
Six clubs.

23:01.313 --> 23:03.815
Get a broom and sweep up some
of that shit over there,

23:03.815 --> 23:05.817
especially under
silvio, alright?

23:06.318 --> 23:07.319
Pair of kings.

23:07.319 --> 23:08.820
What's the bet?

23:08.820 --> 23:10.322
$800.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.824
What the fuck could
you possibly have?

23:12.824 --> 23:14.326
Incredible luck.

23:14.326 --> 23:16.328
You're telling me,
you miserable fuck.

23:16.328 --> 23:18.330
Bet or check.

23:18.330 --> 23:19.331
Don't rush me, sunshine.

23:19.831 --> 23:21.333
You've been rushing me
all fucking night!

23:21.333 --> 23:22.334
He didn't study this
hard in school.

23:22.834 --> 23:24.336
John, please,
the bet's not to you.

23:24.336 --> 23:25.337
Good.

23:25.337 --> 23:26.838
Dealer controls
the game.

23:27.339 --> 23:27.839
Thank you.

23:28.340 --> 23:29.841
Do you fucking mind?

23:29.841 --> 23:31.343
Jesus, do you ever
shut the fuck up?

23:31.343 --> 23:36.848
And blow that fucking
smoke somewhere else!

23:36.848 --> 23:37.849
What the fuck
are you doing?

23:38.350 --> 23:39.351
Sil, take it easy.

23:39.351 --> 23:40.852
I'm losing
my balls over here!

23:40.852 --> 23:42.354
This fucking moron's
playing hazel.

23:42.854 --> 23:44.356
Get the fuck
out of here!

23:44.356 --> 23:45.857
I was just trying to
sweep the cheese away--

23:46.358 --> 23:46.858
why?

23:46.858 --> 23:47.859
Why now?

23:48.360 --> 23:49.361
Leave it there.

23:49.361 --> 23:50.362
I don't know,
i was just--

23:50.862 --> 23:51.863
what?

23:52.364 --> 23:53.865
Where do you get
these fuckin' idiots, huh?

23:54.366 --> 23:55.367
Where do you get them?

23:55.367 --> 23:57.369
He's sweeping the cheese,
i'm trying to get--

23:57.369 --> 23:59.371
leave the fucking cheese
there, alright!

23:59.871 --> 24:01.373
I love fucking cheese
at my feet!

24:01.373 --> 24:03.375
I stick motherfuckin'
provolone in my socks at night,

24:03.875 --> 24:06.378
so they smell
like your sister's
crotch in the morning.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.879
Alright?

24:07.879 --> 24:10.882
Leave the fucking
cock- sucking cheese
where it is!

24:10.882 --> 24:12.884
Here, here, here.

24:12.884 --> 24:13.885
Go ahead.

24:14.386 --> 24:20.392
Have a good time.

24:20.392 --> 24:20.892
$800.

24:20.892 --> 24:22.394
Call.

24:22.394 --> 24:23.395
Hey, why don't you go
fix a fucking dick

24:23.395 --> 24:25.397
or whatever the fuck
it is you do.

24:25.397 --> 24:27.899
Hey, dr. Fried, you know
about that viagra shit?

24:27.899 --> 24:29.401
He won't quit,
this fucking guy.

24:29.401 --> 24:31.403
Go ahead.

24:31.403 --> 24:32.404
I heard they were
sinking a crate of it

24:32.904 --> 24:34.406
down to the titani
c to try and raise it.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.907
Very good, very good.

24:36.408 --> 24:37.909
Alright, down and dirty.

24:37.909 --> 24:41.913
Last card,
automatic $1200 bump.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.915
Kings rule the realm.

24:43.915 --> 24:48.420
Kings talk.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.421
Check.

24:49.921 --> 24:52.424
Door's wide open,
dr. Fried.

24:52.424 --> 24:53.925
Check.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.427
David.

24:55.427 --> 24:59.431
He checks.

24:59.431 --> 25:01.433
Bet $1200.

25:01.433 --> 25:03.435
I'm gonna call.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.937
Because you ain't
got dick.

25:05.937 --> 25:07.439
Can i steal
this fucking hand?

25:07.939 --> 25:09.441
I think i can.

25:09.441 --> 25:10.942
I'll raise 12.

25:10.942 --> 25:12.944
See, you should
have checked.

25:12.944 --> 25:13.945
You got shit.

25:13.945 --> 25:17.449
Now it's gonna cost
you another bet.

25:17.449 --> 25:19.451
Call'em.

25:19.451 --> 25:23.955
Oh, fuck.

25:24.456 --> 25:26.458
Let's see'em, boys.

25:26.458 --> 25:27.959
Trips.

25:27.959 --> 25:28.460
Three deuces.

25:28.960 --> 25:29.961
Cry me a river.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.464
Three beautiful kings.

25:32.464 --> 25:34.466
Flush.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.468
You motherfucker.

25:36.468 --> 25:38.470
You slow rolled me.

25:38.470 --> 25:39.971
What the fuck were
you doing in that hand?

25:40.472 --> 25:41.473
His money's good.

25:41.473 --> 25:43.475
He wants to sail,
it's his business.

25:43.475 --> 25:44.976
Fuck you, too.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.978
I should have stayed
with my goomah tonight.

25:46.978 --> 25:50.482
Hey, cheese fuck,
get me some food.

26:11.002 --> 26:12.003
I'm so pissed.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.004
Good morning.

26:13.004 --> 26:14.506
Hunter just called me

26:14.506 --> 26:17.509
and told me rachel weiss got an
early acceptance to wesleyan.

26:17.509 --> 26:19.010
And you didn't
expect it?

26:19.010 --> 26:20.512
No.

26:20.512 --> 26:21.513
Think about it.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.014
Did you ever
see her mom?

26:23.014 --> 26:25.016
Please, i'm blacker
than her mother.

26:25.517 --> 26:26.518
Well.

26:27.018 --> 26:29.521
Should have mentioned
that on your application.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.543
What time is it?

26:51.543 --> 26:52.544
It's almost nine.

26:53.044 --> 26:54.546
How we doing?

26:54.546 --> 26:56.548
Slowing down.

26:56.548 --> 27:04.055
Alright, see if they want
to close the lights.

27:04.556 --> 27:10.562
Thanks.

27:11.062 --> 27:13.064
Anybody want
more coffee?

27:13.064 --> 27:14.566
Yeah, please, tony.

27:14.566 --> 27:19.070
Put a little'buca in it
for me, would you?

27:19.070 --> 27:20.071
Anyone want to
close the lights?

27:20.572 --> 27:21.573
Is that a game?

27:21.573 --> 27:23.575
He's a pisser, this kid,
is it a game?

27:24.075 --> 27:25.577
Closing the lights means--

27:25.577 --> 27:28.079
it means, do you want to admit
that you lost and pack it in.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.080
Me?

27:29.080 --> 27:30.081
No.

27:30.081 --> 27:31.082
Alright, cut please.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.083
Here you go.

27:32.083 --> 27:33.585
Thank you, francis.

27:33.585 --> 27:34.586
Coming out.

27:35.086 --> 27:39.591
To sil, to the doctor,
how about a winner this time?

27:39.591 --> 27:42.093
How much is he
into us for?

27:42.093 --> 27:44.596
About 45 boxes of ziti.

27:45.096 --> 27:46.097
What?

27:46.598 --> 27:47.599
He grabbed another ten
while you were asleep.

27:47.599 --> 27:49.601
He said you okayed it.

27:51.102 --> 27:53.104
Go get that.

28:04.616 --> 28:10.622
Look at this
fuckin' line up.

28:10.622 --> 28:12.123
Ho, johnny sack.

28:12.624 --> 28:15.126
Must've had free
tokens at the tunnel.

28:15.126 --> 28:19.631
How'd you expect to make a dim
with this fuckin' stonewaller.

28:25.637 --> 28:27.639
How did you
get in here?

28:27.639 --> 28:29.140
Same as you.

28:29.140 --> 28:31.142
Through the front door.

28:31.142 --> 28:32.644
Hi, rich.

28:32.644 --> 28:33.645
Hi, rich?

28:34.145 --> 28:35.647
You want some lox.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.148
I got some nice,
fresh lox.

28:37.649 --> 28:39.150
You got some fucking balls,
you know that?

28:39.150 --> 28:40.652
What'd i do?

28:40.652 --> 28:45.156
I should stab you in
the fucking eye.

28:45.156 --> 28:46.157
Hey, c'mon, rich.

28:46.157 --> 28:46.658
Get your hand off of me.

28:47.158 --> 28:48.660
I'll put one in your head.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.161
Hey, don't fucking
threaten me, richie.

28:50.161 --> 28:51.663
Don't threaten you?

28:51.663 --> 28:53.665
I got a hard- on
for you already.

28:53.665 --> 28:58.670
Give me a reason.

28:58.670 --> 29:00.171
Don't let me fucking
embarrass you.

29:00.171 --> 29:05.677
Outside now,
i want to talk!

29:05.677 --> 29:07.679
Christopher,
get everybody a drink,

29:07.679 --> 29:09.180
i'll be right back.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.682
That's it, cash me out.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.684
No, c'mon, frank, doc.

29:12.684 --> 29:14.185
Sit down.

29:14.185 --> 29:15.687
You know,
it's a misunderstanding,

29:15.687 --> 29:16.688
right, richie?

29:16.688 --> 29:17.689
No, no, tony, i'm wiped.

29:17.689 --> 29:19.190
I'll settle up
with you next game.

29:19.190 --> 29:21.192
Give my regard
s to your uncle.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.694
Let me get you a little
breakfast, c'mon.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.195
Nah, no really.

29:24.195 --> 29:26.698
I got tickets for
the rueles- harris
fight tonight.

29:27.198 --> 29:28.199
Oh, yeah.

29:28.199 --> 29:30.201
Matt, thanks a lot.

29:30.201 --> 29:31.202
Here's one
for your pal.

29:31.703 --> 29:32.704
Cash me out,
will ya, sunshine?

29:32.704 --> 29:34.706
Thank you,
mr. Sinatra, jr. , sir.

29:34.706 --> 29:37.208
I shut him
the fuck down.

29:37.208 --> 29:40.211
He comes here
and he sticks it up my ass!

29:40.211 --> 29:42.213
What's that got to do with you
disrespecting my game?

29:42.213 --> 29:44.215
Like you wouldn't do
anything different?

29:44.716 --> 29:46.217
You're fucking right.

29:46.217 --> 29:49.721
You know, tony,
i'm getting sick of this
"holier than thou" act.

29:49.721 --> 29:51.222
And i'm not the only one.

29:51.222 --> 29:52.223
Oh, really.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.225
If anybody wants
to make a move...

29:54.225 --> 29:55.727
c'mon, tony.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.228
Don't get so
fucking dramatic.

29:57.729 --> 29:58.730
All i'm saying
is sometimes you act

29:58.730 --> 30:00.231
like you're in
a different business.

30:00.732 --> 30:02.233
Now, send that
little prick out, so
i can talk to him.

30:02.734 --> 30:03.735
No.

30:03.735 --> 30:07.238
Do you realize
this motherless fuck

30:07.238 --> 30:10.241
is into me for
over eight large?

30:10.241 --> 30:11.743
He's got money
to play here?

30:11.743 --> 30:14.746
Let him pay me my money.

30:14.746 --> 30:16.247
Send him out.

30:16.247 --> 30:17.749
You go home, richie.

30:17.749 --> 30:20.251
This ain't gonna happen
to one of my players.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.769
Everything alright?

30:43.775 --> 30:45.276
He was pissed.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.779
I'm gonna let
you sleep one day.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.781
Then you're gonna
get the fuck up

30:49.781 --> 30:51.783
and you're gonna
go get my $45, 000.

30:51.783 --> 30:53.785
Hey, no problem.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.787
Jesus, how about the luck
on that silvio, huh?

30:56.287 --> 31:00.792
Why don't you
shut the fuck up?

31:01.292 --> 31:02.794
I could use a schvitz.

31:02.794 --> 31:05.797
You want to
go for a schvitz?

31:05.797 --> 31:10.301
If after one day,
you don't give me every penny,

31:10.301 --> 31:11.803
i'm gonna send somebody
down to your joint

31:11.803 --> 31:14.806
every saturday for
five percent interest.

31:15.306 --> 31:16.307
If you don't have it,

31:16.808 --> 31:17.809
it gets tacked onto
the principle.

31:17.809 --> 31:19.310
Do you understand?

31:19.811 --> 31:23.815
Listen, tony, i had a good
run there for a while.

31:23.815 --> 31:30.822
I should have quit
then though, huh.

31:30.822 --> 31:33.324
So, you never told me how
your kid made out at bowdoin.

31:33.324 --> 31:38.830
How my what?

31:39.330 --> 31:44.836
How your daughter
made out at bowdoin.

31:44.836 --> 31:47.338
Would you like
anything else?

31:47.338 --> 31:51.342
No.

31:51.342 --> 31:55.847
Tony, did i do
something to insult you?

31:55.847 --> 31:59.350
Two days.

32:23.374 --> 32:25.877
How'd we do?

32:26.377 --> 32:28.379
Not finished countin',
but it's up there.

32:28.379 --> 32:31.382
At least 80 boxes of zitis
after expenses.

32:31.382 --> 32:33.384
Two boxes came
out of my pocket.

32:33.384 --> 32:34.886
Fellas.

32:34.886 --> 32:36.888
Salut.

32:36.888 --> 32:37.889
Salut.

32:37.889 --> 32:43.895
Salut.

32:43.895 --> 32:45.396
You fuckin
g believe it?

32:45.396 --> 32:47.398
We now run
the executive game.

32:47.398 --> 32:48.399
Oh, yeah.

32:48.399 --> 32:49.901
Sil, you remember
when me and you

32:49.901 --> 32:52.403
used to look through that
crack in that painted door

32:52.403 --> 32:54.906
while my old man and
uncle junior had it?

32:54.906 --> 32:56.407
Yeah, i remember.

32:56.407 --> 32:57.909
Junior was a fucking prick
even then.

32:57.909 --> 33:02.413
He'd come out and
he'd chase us down the street.

33:02.413 --> 33:06.918
Executive game.

33:48.459 --> 33:48.960
Do you mind?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.461
God.

33:50.461 --> 33:51.963
Trying to get some sleep,
i've been working all night.

33:51.963 --> 33:54.966
How you doing, eric?

33:54.966 --> 33:56.467
Pretty good.

33:56.467 --> 33:57.969
Sounds good.

33:57.969 --> 33:58.970
Thanks.

33:59.470 --> 34:00.972
Are you awake now?

34:00.972 --> 34:01.973
Yeah.

34:01.973 --> 34:02.473
Good.

34:02.974 --> 34:03.474
Close the door.

34:03.975 --> 34:04.976
Hey.

34:04.976 --> 34:05.977
Where's your mother?

34:06.477 --> 34:09.480
The store.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.982
Oh, aunt barb called.

34:10.982 --> 34:12.984
Uncle tom'
s father died.

34:12.984 --> 34:14.985
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

34:15.485 --> 34:18.489
Tom, sr.?

34:18.489 --> 34:19.489
When?

34:19.489 --> 34:20.992
I don't know.

34:20.992 --> 34:21.993
What the hell happened?

34:21.993 --> 34:23.494
I don't know.

34:23.494 --> 34:26.496
The guy's here almost every
christmas eve, you don't ask?

34:26.496 --> 34:30.001
Somebody says,
"joe blow died,"
normal people ask,

34:30.501 --> 34:35.005
"how? What happened?"

34:35.005 --> 34:39.010
Jesus.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.512
This gust of wind comes,
knocks him off the roof.

34:41.512 --> 34:44.514
All for a satellite dish.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.016
That's very sad.

34:46.016 --> 34:47.518
Yeah.

34:47.518 --> 34:49.520
How old?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.022
65.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.523
Guy works his whole life,
takes care of his family,

34:53.024 --> 34:53.524
does the right thing.

34:53.524 --> 34:55.025
One day after he retires.

34:55.525 --> 35:01.032
One day.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.033
It's freaky.

35:02.533 --> 35:04.535
Carlos casteneda said,

35:05.036 --> 35:09.540
"live every moment
as if it were your
last dance on earth."

35:09.540 --> 35:10.541
Who the fuck listens
to prize fighters?

35:11.042 --> 35:12.543
Ali, maybe.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.545
He had a little wisdom.

35:14.545 --> 35:19.050
Well, at least tom, sr. Isn't
the happy wanderer anymore.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.052
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean?

35:21.052 --> 35:22.053
He got his.

35:22.053 --> 35:24.555
You don't have
to pummel his ass.

35:24.555 --> 35:27.058
He's joined the ranks
of the unlucky.

35:27.058 --> 35:31.562
Maybe you know what you're
talking about, but i don't.

35:37.568 --> 35:39.070
Found out i ha
d another uncle.

35:39.070 --> 35:40.571
A retarded uncle.

35:40.571 --> 35:43.574
My father's brother,
that nobody told me about.

35:43.574 --> 35:45.576
You believe this shit.

35:45.576 --> 35:50.581
Was he seriously
developmentally disabled?

35:51.082 --> 35:59.090
Serious, no, he had everybody
in stitches back then.

35:59.090 --> 36:02.593
Now that you found
out that you have a
retarded family member,

36:03.094 --> 36:05.096
do you feel better
about coming here?

36:05.096 --> 36:06.097
What?

36:06.097 --> 36:08.099
Is it permissible now?

36:08.099 --> 36:10.601
Is it enough of
a sad tragedy

36:10.601 --> 36:14.105
that you can join
the rest of the douchebags?

36:21.612 --> 36:24.615
I was just talking to him
a couple days ago.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.617
Yes, he was
a wonderful man.

36:26.617 --> 36:29.620
We're here
for you, barbara.

36:37.628 --> 36:39.630
Va f'ancula tu.

36:39.630 --> 36:42.133
You knew we were bound to
see them at some function.

36:42.133 --> 36:46.637
Just relax.

36:46.637 --> 36:51.142
Oh.

36:51.642 --> 36:53.144
Fuckin' betty davis
back there.

36:53.144 --> 36:57.148
No scenes.

36:57.648 --> 37:00.651
Oh.

37:00.651 --> 37:02.153
C'mon, get up,
we're leaving.

37:02.653 --> 37:04.155
Thank you, god.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.656
I will fucking
kill you!

37:05.656 --> 37:07.158
We paid our respects,
now, we're leaving.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.659
This may come as
a surprise to you,

37:08.659 --> 37:09.660
but these people
are not here

37:10.161 --> 37:11.662
to see the sopranos
kill each other.

37:11.662 --> 37:13.664
Now, show respect
for tom's father,
will you, please?

37:14.165 --> 37:15.166
Hi, carm.

37:15.666 --> 37:17.168
Hi, richie.

37:17.168 --> 37:19.670
Do i give the boost
to your sister?

37:19.670 --> 37:23.174
C'mon, i gotta
give mine too.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.175
How you doing?

37:24.675 --> 37:25.676
I'm sorry.

37:25.676 --> 37:28.179
Appreciate it.

37:46.197 --> 37:50.201
How many rooms
this place got?

37:50.201 --> 37:52.703
It's a big joint.

37:52.703 --> 37:57.708
Pretty good racket.

37:58.209 --> 38:00.211
I don't think you
can smoke in here.

38:00.211 --> 38:02.213
Who's gonna complain, huh?

38:02.213 --> 38:03.714
Him?

38:04.215 --> 38:05.216
Hey.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.717
You mind?

38:06.717 --> 38:12.723
He don't mind.

38:12.723 --> 38:17.728
Listen, anthony, i'm sorry
about blowing up in your game.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.235
You were out of line.

38:24.235 --> 38:26.237
What am i supposed
to do with you?

38:26.737 --> 38:27.738
What?

38:27.738 --> 38:30.741
Back off and respect the title,
you fucking jerkoff.

38:30.741 --> 38:32.243
It's your ball.

38:32.243 --> 38:33.744
You make the rules.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.246
No, no.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.248
I don't make'em,
they've always been there.

38:37.748 --> 38:39.750
Now, you get this.

38:39.750 --> 38:41.252
David scatino doesn't
pay you a fuckin' penny

38:41.252 --> 38:42.753
until i get mine first.

38:42.753 --> 38:45.256
That's the tax you get for
raising your hands in my game.

38:45.756 --> 38:47.758
I get mine first,
then you get yours.

38:47.758 --> 38:49.260
That's the way
it's gonna be.

38:49.260 --> 38:52.763
I don't do something,
how's it gonna look?

38:58.769 --> 38:59.770
If everyone could please
take their seats,

39:00.271 --> 39:03.774
we are about to begin.

39:04.275 --> 39:05.776
In the name of the father
and of the son

39:05.776 --> 39:12.283
and of the holy ghost, amen.

39:12.283 --> 39:15.286
Since it has pleased all mighty
god to call back our brother

39:15.286 --> 39:17.288
from this life to himself,

39:17.288 --> 39:19.290
we commit his body
to the earth,

39:19.290 --> 39:21.292
that it may return to that
from which it was made.

39:21.292 --> 39:28.299
Christ was the first to
rise from the dead...

39:28.299 --> 39:29.800
i'm just saying,

39:29.800 --> 39:31.302
i don't think you should
take any shit from him.

39:31.302 --> 39:32.303
I heard you
the first time.

39:32.303 --> 39:33.804
Let's drop the subject.

39:33.804 --> 39:41.812
Alright.

39:41.812 --> 39:44.315
Tony put me back
in action.

39:44.315 --> 39:46.317
He gave me 50 g's
to put out on the street.

39:46.817 --> 39:48.319
What is that, nothing?

39:48.319 --> 39:50.321
Please, i know
how things work.

39:50.821 --> 39:55.326
Don't forget, i wa
s daddy's little girl.

39:55.826 --> 39:56.827
What the fuck are
you talking about?

39:56.827 --> 39:58.329
You're his responsibility.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.831
He didn't do you
any favor.

40:00.831 --> 40:03.334
When my father was
in tony's position,

40:03.834 --> 40:07.338
he gave romeo martin $50, 000
when he got out of jail.

40:07.338 --> 40:10.341
I'm talking about
30 years ago.

40:10.341 --> 40:13.344
30 years ago.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.346
Today, that's half
a million dollars.

40:15.846 --> 40:19.350
$50, 000, hmm...

40:19.350 --> 40:21.852
mailmen make
more than that.

40:38.369 --> 40:40.371
So, what's this fucking
doctor's appointment you had

40:40.371 --> 40:42.373
all of a sudden when
my friend comes
to see you, huh.

40:42.373 --> 40:43.874
What do you think?

40:43.874 --> 40:45.376
I'm still the kid
on the school bus.

40:45.376 --> 40:47.378
Please, tony,
i'm doing my best here.

40:47.378 --> 40:49.380
I fucked up, okay.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.882
I'm gonna make it all work
out somehow, i swear.

40:51.882 --> 40:53.384
What do yo
u got for me?

40:53.384 --> 40:54.385
I'm tapped.

40:54.885 --> 40:55.886
Stand up.

40:56.387 --> 40:56.887
Why?

40:56.887 --> 40:58.389
'Cause i just said so.

40:58.389 --> 40:59.890
Get up.

41:00.391 --> 41:01.892
Get up or i'm gonna ri
p your fucking head off.

41:01.892 --> 41:03.394
Get up.

41:03.894 --> 41:05.396
C'mon.

41:05.896 --> 41:09.900
I'm sorry, tony, i wouldn't
do anything to insult you.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.903
Our kids go to the same
school together.

41:12.903 --> 41:16.907
Ah!

41:16.907 --> 41:20.411
Tony, i'm sorry, i'm sorry,
i'm just having some bad luck!

41:20.411 --> 41:23.914
Yeah, it just
got worse.

41:24.415 --> 41:25.416
I'm gonna come back.

41:25.416 --> 41:28.919
My luck's gonna change.

41:28.919 --> 41:29.920
Tomorrow.

41:30.421 --> 41:32.423
I want something tomorrow,
you understand me?

41:47.438 --> 41:49.440
Whoa, david.

41:49.940 --> 41:50.941
Hey.

41:50.941 --> 41:52.443
Where's the wife?

41:52.443 --> 41:53.944
She's home.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.946
Can i talk to you?

41:55.946 --> 41:57.448
You alright?

41:57.448 --> 41:59.450
Sit down.

41:59.450 --> 42:00.951
Sit down.

42:07.958 --> 42:10.461
Talk to me.

42:10.461 --> 42:12.963
I got myself
in a little bind.

42:12.963 --> 42:16.967
Jesus, i feel ashamed.

42:17.468 --> 42:18.969
What's going on?

42:18.969 --> 42:19.970
What happened?

42:19.970 --> 42:23.974
I'm in a jam,
artie, a bad one.

42:23.974 --> 42:26.977
This could cost me big,
my marriage, my business.

42:26.977 --> 42:28.479
Alright, alright, relax.

42:28.479 --> 42:29.480
I'm sure there's
something we can do.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.482
What kind of jam?

42:31.482 --> 42:33.484
Oh, jeez, you didn't
knock up that tae- bo broad

42:33.484 --> 42:34.485
you had working,
did you?

42:34.985 --> 42:36.987
God, no, artie.

42:37.488 --> 42:38.989
Talk to me,
i'm your friend.

42:39.490 --> 42:41.492
I need money.

42:41.492 --> 42:44.495
Money, artie.

42:44.495 --> 42:46.497
Not much, just...

42:46.497 --> 42:48.999
i swear on my kid,

42:48.999 --> 42:51.001
i'll get it back to yo
u before you even miss it.

42:51.001 --> 42:52.503
How much money
we talkin'?

42:52.503 --> 42:54.505
Not much, just enough...

42:54.505 --> 42:56.006
to give me
some breathing room

42:56.006 --> 42:59.510
till i can get
the rest together.

42:59.510 --> 43:04.515
It's $20, 000.

43:05.015 --> 43:07.518
Davie.

43:07.518 --> 43:10.020
Shit.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.021
Bad timing.

43:11.522 --> 43:13.023
Man.

43:13.023 --> 43:14.024
You're not gonna
believe this.

43:14.024 --> 43:17.027
I got to put a new roof
on this place.

43:22.032 --> 43:23.033
God forgive me
for sayin' this,

43:23.033 --> 43:25.035
but did you consider
chapter 11?

43:25.035 --> 43:27.037
I don't think tony
soprano's gonna buy that.

43:27.037 --> 43:29.039
Tony.

43:29.039 --> 43:32.042
Oh, jeez, davie.

43:32.042 --> 43:34.044
Jesus christ.

44:13.083 --> 44:16.086
Eric, give me
your keys.

44:16.086 --> 44:17.087
Why?

44:17.087 --> 44:18.088
There's mud al
l over the tires.

44:18.088 --> 44:19.590
Dave, what's wrong?

44:20.090 --> 44:21.091
Say good- bye
to your truck.

44:21.091 --> 44:22.092
What?

44:22.593 --> 44:23.093
Dave.

44:23.594 --> 44:24.595
This is bullshit.

44:25.095 --> 44:26.096
Eric, eric,
get back in the house.

44:26.597 --> 44:27.598
I warned you.

44:27.598 --> 44:29.099
No off- roading,
i gave you enough chances.

44:29.099 --> 44:30.601
Dave, this is
not the place.

44:30.601 --> 44:32.102
Dad, i didn't
do anything.

44:32.102 --> 44:33.604
Eric, accountability
is everything.

44:33.604 --> 44:34.605
Off- roading!

44:35.105 --> 44:36.106
I drove it onto
the field at school

44:36.106 --> 44:37.608
to bring some girls to
cheerleading practice.

44:38.108 --> 44:39.109
There's mud al
l over the doors!

44:39.109 --> 44:41.111
I warned you
and warned you, eric.

44:41.612 --> 44:42.613
I didn't do anything!

44:42.613 --> 44:44.114
I didn't do
anything, mom.

44:44.114 --> 44:45.616
Eric, get in the house!

44:46.116 --> 44:47.117
I fucking hate
all of you!

44:47.117 --> 44:49.119
You apologize right now.

44:49.620 --> 44:52.623
Jesus.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.124
Open'em.

44:54.124 --> 44:56.627
I knew it was a car.

44:56.627 --> 45:03.133
It's a sports
utility vehicle.

45:03.133 --> 45:07.638
You like it?

45:07.638 --> 45:10.140
This is eric's jeep.

45:10.140 --> 45:11.642
Oh, my god.

45:11.642 --> 45:13.644
Is this eric scatino's jeep?

45:13.644 --> 45:15.145
Yeah, but it's
yours now.

45:15.646 --> 45:17.147
His dad sold
it to you?

45:17.147 --> 45:18.148
Yeah, you know.

45:18.148 --> 45:20.150
Something like that.

45:20.150 --> 45:22.653
What do you mean,
something like that?

45:22.653 --> 45:25.155
You know.

45:33.163 --> 45:34.164
Jesus, tony.

45:34.665 --> 45:35.666
She don't want it, fine!

45:35.666 --> 45:37.167
Don't take it!

45:37.167 --> 45:38.669
But i'll eat it
before i give it back.

45:39.169 --> 45:40.170
What am i, a sucker?

45:40.671 --> 45:41.672
What does eric have to do
with his asshole father?

45:42.172 --> 45:43.173
He didn't do
anything to you.

45:43.674 --> 45:45.175
The guy owed me money,
and he did the right thing.

45:45.175 --> 45:46.677
He offered that car up
as partial payment.

45:46.677 --> 45:47.678
Yeah, right.

45:47.678 --> 45:48.679
You see this?

45:48.679 --> 45:49.680
You see,
this is you talking.

45:50.180 --> 45:51.181
I just hope you know

45:51.181 --> 45:52.683
his wife is very close
to the brother- in- law

45:52.683 --> 45:54.184
of a provost at georgetown.

45:54.184 --> 45:55.185
The who?

45:55.185 --> 45:56.186
Oh, great.

45:56.687 --> 45:57.688
Go ahead, you want to act
"holier than thou"?

45:57.688 --> 45:59.189
You go right ahead,
but i'm not giving it back.

45:59.189 --> 46:00.691
I'm gonna take that car
and sell it to pussy

46:00.691 --> 46:03.193
and i'm gonna buy clothes
and food and shoes

46:03.694 --> 46:05.195
and cd players and all
the rest of the shit

46:05.195 --> 46:07.698
that i've been buying since
the day you were born.

46:07.698 --> 46:10.701
Everything this family has
comes from the work i do.

46:10.701 --> 46:12.202
Alright, tony,
that's enough.

46:12.202 --> 46:15.205
A grown man made a wager.

46:15.205 --> 46:16.707
He lost.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.208
He made another one.

46:18.208 --> 46:18.709
He lost again.

46:19.209 --> 46:20.210
End of story.

46:20.210 --> 46:21.712
So, take that
high moral ground

46:21.712 --> 46:24.214
and go sleep in the fucking
bus station if you want!

47:06.256 --> 47:09.760
Oh, jesus.

47:09.760 --> 47:11.261
Where?

47:11.261 --> 47:18.268
A few rows back.

47:18.268 --> 47:19.770
Tony...

47:19.770 --> 47:22.272
almost didn't make it.

47:22.272 --> 47:23.774
Where's janice?

47:23.774 --> 47:25.275
Didn't i see those at
the wake the other day?

47:25.275 --> 47:26.777
That's funny.

47:26.777 --> 47:28.779
They're behind.

47:29.279 --> 47:31.281
I'll see you
after the show.

47:56.306 --> 48:01.311
Just keep
thinking "meadow."

48:01.311 --> 48:03.313
Eric, c'mon,
let's talk.

48:03.313 --> 48:04.815
You're gonna
leave me here.

48:04.815 --> 48:06.316
I thought you
were my friend.

48:06.316 --> 48:07.317
I am.

48:07.818 --> 48:09.319
I can't stop my dad
from selling it.

48:09.319 --> 48:10.821
Yeah, well,
your dad's a fucking asshole.

48:11.321 --> 48:12.322
You know that?

48:12.322 --> 48:14.324
He's a real low- life
fucking asshole!

48:14.324 --> 48:15.826
And i suppose yours is
innocent in all this.

48:15.826 --> 48:17.327
For your information,

48:17.327 --> 48:18.829
he gave it to my dad.

48:18.829 --> 48:19.830
It's not like
my dad stole it!

48:20.330 --> 48:21.832
You know what, meadow?

48:21.832 --> 48:25.836
Fuck you, fuck your gangster
father and fuck this!

48:34.344 --> 48:37.848
Welcome, everyone, to verbum dei
high school's "cabaret night."

48:37.848 --> 48:39.850
As we are recording
tonight's performance,

48:39.850 --> 48:41.852
we'd like to
remind everyone,

48:41.852 --> 48:45.355
please, no talking,
no pictures or videotaping.

48:45.355 --> 48:48.859
And please remember to turn off
those pagers and cell phones.

48:48.859 --> 48:49.860
If you're worried
about coughing

48:50.360 --> 48:51.862
and feel a nice
lozenge might help,

48:51.862 --> 48:55.365
may we suggest that now would
be the time to unwrap it

48:55.365 --> 48:57.367
as opposed to
during the performance.

48:59.369 --> 49:00.370
A program note:

49:00.871 --> 49:01.872
In the second act,
"sun and moon"

49:02.372 --> 49:05.375
to performed by eric scatino
and meadow soprano

49:05.375 --> 49:07.878
has been canceled.

49:07.878 --> 49:10.881
Regretfully, mr. Scatino will
not be performing tonight.

49:11.381 --> 49:14.384
Instead miss soprano
will perform a solo, singing,

49:14.885 --> 49:16.386
"my heart will go on",

49:16.386 --> 49:18.388
the theme song from "titanic".

49:18.388 --> 49:20.390
Enjoy the show.

49:20.390 --> 49:21.892
Well, that's a lucky break.

49:21.892 --> 49:23.894
I wonder what happened.
