00:16.540 --> 00:18.460
KC, you've been listening?

00:18.460 --> 00:19.830
Oh, yeah, sorry.
I'm sorry.

00:19.830 --> 00:21.420
I'm just still
kind of freaked out

00:21.420 --> 00:22.750
about my mission
last night.

00:22.750 --> 00:24.830
I mean, I actually thought
that I was going to die,

00:24.830 --> 00:29.290
and it made me realize
the one thing
I'm missing in my life

00:29.290 --> 00:30.710
-is Darien.
-A manicure!

00:32.170 --> 00:35.960
Darien. Wait, what, Darien?

00:35.960 --> 00:38.830
Yeah, I mean, I still
have feelings for him.

00:38.830 --> 00:41.040
What? Then why are you
telling me this?

00:41.040 --> 00:42.380
You should be telling him.

00:42.380 --> 00:43.710
You know what,
you're right.

00:43.710 --> 00:44.960
You're right.

00:44.960 --> 00:46.460
I have wasted way
too much time.

00:46.460 --> 00:47.710
I'm gonna go
tell him right now.

00:47.710 --> 00:49.460
-Good. He's right there.
-He's right there.

-Pineapple.
-Pineapple.

00:56.670 --> 00:59.540
I feel like you're just stalling
by repeating what I say.

I feel like I'm just stalling
by repeating what you say.

01:01.460 --> 01:04.120
He is leaving. Go!

01:04.120 --> 01:05.170
Okay, okay. Okay!

Darien.

What's up? It's been
a while since we talked,
you know?

01:12.210 --> 01:14.960
Probably because you
told me you didn't want
to talk to me anymore...

01:14.960 --> 01:17.000
while I was laying
in a hospital bed...

01:17.000 --> 01:20.710
with broken ribs,
then a broken heart.

01:21.790 --> 01:23.500

We're fin-nin-nin-nin-ished

04:09.960 --> 04:12.040
You know, fine!
Who needs you!

04:12.040 --> 04:15.000
I'll ask someone else
to be my assistant.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.500
Judy, you weren't
very nice to Petey.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.420
Now, go and apologize
and tell him you're
gonna be his assistant.

04:23.420 --> 04:25.170
-Why should I?
-Because I'm your mother

04:25.170 --> 04:26.710
and your superior officer.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.710
Boom! Double whammy.
Got you again.

04:40.750 --> 04:43.540
What's with the dress,
and are you wearing lipstick?

04:46.040 --> 04:48.330
How did you know that?
You didn't even turn around.

04:48.330 --> 04:52.290
Honey, I'm your mom.
I know everything.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.620
So, what are you
all dressed up for?

04:54.620 --> 04:56.710
Can't a girl just get
all pretty 'cause she
feels like it?

04:56.710 --> 04:59.790
Mm-hmm. What's his name?

05:01.580 --> 05:02.710
Darien.

05:02.710 --> 05:03.620
Interesting!

05:03.620 --> 05:04.880
He has the same name

05:04.880 --> 05:06.830
as the boy I said
you can't date.

05:06.830 --> 05:08.670
-It's different now.
-How?

05:08.670 --> 05:10.710
Abby, Erica, and Richard
are all behind bars,

05:10.710 --> 05:12.620
so nobody's out
to get him...

05:12.620 --> 05:15.290
except for me.

05:16.670 --> 05:18.880
Look, Mom,
I really like him, okay,

05:18.880 --> 05:20.830
and I'm a girl, okay?

05:20.830 --> 05:22.670
I'm not just a spy,
and at some point

05:22.670 --> 05:25.620
I'm gonna have a boyfriend
whether you or the organization

05:25.620 --> 05:27.080
or the entire world
want me to or not.

05:27.080 --> 05:28.670
KC, as your ranking officer,

05:28.670 --> 05:31.500
I'm saying you
absolutely cannot do this.

05:31.500 --> 05:35.210
But as your mom I'm saying
go get 'em, baby!

05:41.170 --> 05:45.170
Hey, KC, this is
my girlfriend, Bianca.

05:45.170 --> 05:46.620
-Nice to meet you.
-You too!

05:46.620 --> 05:48.790
Sorry we're late.
Totally my fault.

05:48.790 --> 05:50.500
The blood drive I was running
ran overtime

05:50.500 --> 05:51.960
because there were
so many donors.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.290
I broke a new record!

05:54.790 --> 05:56.960
And then on the way here
someone had car trouble,

05:56.960 --> 05:59.500
so I pushed them
to the nearest gas station.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.420
My little do-gooder.
Isn't she perfect?

06:02.420 --> 06:04.250
Yeah! Yeah, she sure is.

06:04.250 --> 06:06.540
Um, speaking of perfect,
this is my man--

06:06.540 --> 06:09.580
Trey Appleton Jr.!

06:11.080 --> 06:13.080
I can't tell you
how happy I am to finally

06:13.080 --> 06:16.120
meet the guy who couldn't
hold on to my gal's heart.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.120
Well, your loss is
Trey Appleton Jr.'s gain!

06:21.120 --> 06:23.040
Am I right, pumpkin?

06:23.040 --> 06:25.250
(giggles cheerlessly)

06:27.080 --> 06:29.210
Anyway, how 'bout you guys
get your shoes on

06:29.210 --> 06:31.040
and we'll start bowling.

06:31.040 --> 06:32.670
Okay.

06:32.670 --> 06:35.670
Hey, Trey, I never see you
around school.

06:35.670 --> 06:37.540
That's because he
doesn't go to Hamilton.

06:37.540 --> 06:39.880
-He goes to, um--
-American University.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.880
Yeah, that's right,
KC's dating a college man!

06:42.880 --> 06:45.790
I know, quelle scandal!

06:48.120 --> 06:49.120
Anyway.

06:51.670 --> 06:54.170
Why don't we, uh,
break into teams?

06:54.170 --> 06:56.920
Maybe we should make it
interesting and, like,
mix up the couples.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.750
Love it! Let's do
boys versus girls.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.170
Oh, actually,
I was thinking--

07:00.170 --> 07:02.170
Boys versus girls it is!

07:04.500 --> 07:05.750
You're lucky, Darien.

07:05.750 --> 07:07.750
This one can't bowl
for beans!

07:09.330 --> 07:10.580
Last time we went,

07:10.580 --> 07:12.620
she took a toddler out
five lanes over.

07:13.920 --> 07:15.000
That's so funny!

07:15.000 --> 07:16.620
I started
a fundraising campaign

07:16.620 --> 07:18.040
for victims
of athletic injuries.

07:18.040 --> 07:20.000
Oh, of course you did!

07:20.000 --> 07:21.920
Didn't I tell you
Bianca was the best?

07:21.920 --> 07:23.460
Yeah, well,
I don't know.

07:23.460 --> 07:24.790
May be a tie.

07:28.170 --> 07:33.120
This one can't keep his hands
off of me, can he?

07:37.880 --> 07:41.540
The whole thing was awkward
and just horrible,

07:41.540 --> 07:43.920
and the worst part is
Bianca might be the nicest girl

07:43.920 --> 07:46.380
I have ever met
in my entire life.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.750
I've gotta get rid of her.

07:48.750 --> 07:52.790
Uh, okay, KC, I realize that
is acceptable in the spy world,

07:52.790 --> 07:58.380
but here on Planet Normal People
that will get you 15 to life.

07:58.380 --> 08:00.750
Marisa, I don't mean
"get rid of her" get rid of her.

08:00.750 --> 08:03.620
I mean... you know...

08:03.620 --> 08:05.500
get them to break up!

08:05.500 --> 08:07.420
Me-ow!

08:07.420 --> 08:08.880
No, I mean, look.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.620
Darien and I are destined
to be together, right?

08:11.620 --> 08:13.920
So, if you think about it,
really what I'm doing

08:13.920 --> 08:16.500
is saving her heartache
in the future

08:16.500 --> 08:20.460
by making this "meant to be"
be right now.

08:20.460 --> 08:23.580
(chuckles) All right, sold.
So, what's the plan?

08:23.580 --> 08:26.170
All we have to do is find
someone new for Bianca,

08:26.170 --> 08:29.620
you know, someone
who's totally amazing
and totally available.

08:29.620 --> 08:31.960
Has anyone seen
my foot fungus cream?

08:33.790 --> 08:35.460
Or my pimple cream?

08:35.460 --> 08:37.710
Or my butt rash cream?

08:37.710 --> 08:41.960
I guess what I'm asking is
has anyone seen my cream box?

08:44.040 --> 08:47.620
Well, he may not be amazing,
but he is available.

08:53.380 --> 08:55.460
Tah-dah!

08:55.460 --> 08:56.960
What's that?

08:56.960 --> 08:58.620
A magician's box!

08:58.620 --> 09:00.040
You grab that saw
and split me in half.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.620
I'm afraid
I'll hurt you.

09:01.620 --> 09:03.040
You're the Great Pete-dini.

09:03.040 --> 09:04.250
I'm sure you can do it.

09:04.250 --> 09:05.460
Well, I'll try.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.380
Fin-nin-nin-nin-nin!

09:24.460 --> 09:28.080
I did it!
I really can do magic!

09:28.080 --> 09:31.250
I am the Great Pete-dini!

09:31.250 --> 09:34.880
And I am the Great Ju-dini!

09:34.880 --> 09:37.880
Yeah, no one cares
about the assistant.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.460
The assistant does!

09:42.790 --> 09:45.380
Besides, you're nothing
without me.

09:45.380 --> 09:48.880
You know what?
I don't like your attitude.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.620
(grunts)

09:54.620 --> 09:59.040
Probably should've insulted him
after he put me back together.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.920
Yeah, there's just
one little wrinkle

10:05.920 --> 10:10.080
in the whole put-Ernie-
and-the-perfect-Bianca-
together plan,

10:10.080 --> 10:11.880
and that wrinkle
would be Ernie.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.250
You're right.
You're right, there's no way

10:15.250 --> 10:17.080
he's gonna steal
the quarterback's girlfriend.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.290
Yeah, he would have
to save her life

10:19.290 --> 10:21.920
in a daring feat of heroism.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.080
What? I read a lot
of romance novels.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.120
Okay, I look at the covers.

10:30.710 --> 10:32.290
You may be
on to something.

10:32.290 --> 10:36.000
Who wouldn't fall
for their knight
in shining armor?

10:36.000 --> 10:38.040
We can work with this.
We can work with this.

10:38.040 --> 10:40.040
How are we gonna get Ernie
to save Bianca's life?

10:40.040 --> 10:42.500
(gasps) Oh, I know!

10:46.290 --> 10:48.120
Oh, heavens!

10:48.120 --> 10:51.170
There was an odorless,
tasteless element to this pizza,

10:51.170 --> 10:54.790
and now I fear my life is
in great... peril.

10:56.210 --> 10:59.250
ERNIE: Don't worry, Bianca,
I'll save you!

10:59.250 --> 11:00.880
I've got the antidote!

11:09.170 --> 11:10.500
(grunts)

11:12.120 --> 11:15.580
Well, I had the antidote.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.120
What else you got?

11:23.120 --> 11:26.170
Hmm, how about...

11:26.170 --> 11:31.000
Help! Help! I'm tied up,
and if that wasn't bad enough,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.830
I'm at the edge of the roof!

11:34.170 --> 11:37.750
ERNIE: Don't worry, Bianca,
I'll save you!

11:40.120 --> 11:43.500
(screams, scream fades)

11:48.120 --> 11:51.920
Sorry, Bianca!
I'll pray for you!

11:54.500 --> 11:58.000
Okay. Um. There are
no bad ideas,

11:58.000 --> 11:59.750
but that one
is pretty close.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.000
Fine. How about...

12:05.000 --> 12:08.040
BIANCA: Help!
I didn't notice this well

12:08.040 --> 12:11.250
while I was carrying
my macaroni and cheese
to the table,

12:11.250 --> 12:13.460
and now
I've fallen into it!

12:13.460 --> 12:16.580
ERNIE: Don't worry, Bianca,
I'll save you!

12:19.670 --> 12:21.580
Aah!

12:21.580 --> 12:23.290
Ow!

12:25.170 --> 12:28.460
ERNIE: Help! Help us!
We've fallen in the well!

12:28.460 --> 12:31.380
Ooh, you gonna finish
that mac and cheese?

12:33.830 --> 12:38.960
Um, you know, there are
just a few problems
with that scenario,

12:38.960 --> 12:44.750
one being that there is
no well in the middle
of the cafeteria.

12:44.750 --> 12:47.960
Fine, Shoot-Down Sally.

12:49.210 --> 12:51.380
You got a better idea
to put 'em together?

12:51.380 --> 12:54.420
You know what,
actually, I do.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.040
No, no, no, no, no.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.170
I am not going
to embarrass myself

12:58.170 --> 13:00.380
by trying to steal
the quarterback's girlfriend.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.620
Come on, Ernie, have
a little faith in yourself.

13:02.620 --> 13:06.380
I have total faith that I do
not measure up to Darien.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.750
That guy is fun
and studly and athletic...

13:11.750 --> 13:15.080
Heck, even I'd go out with him
before I'd go out with me.

13:16.210 --> 13:19.080
Do not forget, okay,
you are a total catch.

13:19.080 --> 13:21.710
All you need is a little bit
of confidence, right?

13:21.710 --> 13:24.830
And stay hydrated.
Here, drink this.

13:24.830 --> 13:27.170
That tastes weird.
What is it?

13:27.170 --> 13:28.290
It's confidence serum.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.670
Howard's been
working on it.

13:29.670 --> 13:31.290
It's to help
new agents in the field.

13:31.290 --> 13:33.880
It gives you
a temporary boost
of confidence...

13:33.880 --> 13:36.500
and a couple days of diarrhea,
but you know what,

13:36.500 --> 13:38.500
we'll deal with that later.
Here you go.

13:45.750 --> 13:48.250
Hey, Petey,
sorry I'm late. I was...

13:49.120 --> 13:53.540
Diane! What are you
doing here?

13:53.540 --> 13:54.920
What does it look like?

13:54.920 --> 13:57.460
I'm here to practice
our magic routine.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.120
Don't you mean
our magic routine?

14:00.120 --> 14:01.330
(scoffs)

14:01.330 --> 14:02.500
Pete-dini, work your magic

14:02.500 --> 14:04.500
and make this one disappear,

14:04.500 --> 14:08.000
starting with her big mouth.

14:09.710 --> 14:11.960
I think all those sequins
are cutting off

14:11.960 --> 14:13.830
the circulation
to your brain.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.420
Tell her who
your assistant is, Petey.

14:18.790 --> 14:22.620
Judy, there's
no easy way to say this.

14:22.620 --> 14:24.000
You're out, she's in.

14:25.290 --> 14:29.120
Hey, I guess there is
an easy way to say it.

14:30.290 --> 14:32.960
You're kicking me
out of our magic act?

14:32.960 --> 14:35.750
Yeah, I'm about
that life.

14:35.750 --> 14:39.000
Your negativity
was just bringing me down!

14:39.000 --> 14:40.380
Fine. Who needs you?

14:40.380 --> 14:42.250
As far as I'm concerned,
you can stick it

14:42.250 --> 14:43.380
in your fin-nin-nin-nin-nin!

15:08.500 --> 15:10.000
Hello, there.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.290
-What's your name?
-Bianca.

15:12.290 --> 15:14.330
Well, I'm gonna call
you Booger,

15:14.330 --> 15:18.250
because, baby,
I pick you.

15:20.290 --> 15:23.250
-Ernest.
-I'm not touching that!

15:24.620 --> 15:27.290
What's wrong? Did
you hit your head

15:27.290 --> 15:29.250
when you fell
out of heaven?

15:29.250 --> 15:32.380
Because, baby,
you're an angel.

15:32.380 --> 15:35.420
Yeah, I got the implication.

15:35.420 --> 15:38.210
Look, if you want a girl
to like you,

15:38.210 --> 15:40.500
you can't just spout out
lame pickup lines.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.670
And besides,
I'm already seeing someone.

15:42.670 --> 15:45.620
Why didn't you say so?

15:53.170 --> 15:55.580
Well, hello, there.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.460
Is your name Wi-Fi?

15:58.460 --> 16:02.040
Because, baby, I am feeling
the connection.

16:02.040 --> 16:04.920
Uh-oh. Now I'm feeling
the diarrhea.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.960
At least he wasn't
in a well when it happened.

16:17.500 --> 16:19.540
Look, KC, we tried,
but I don't see

16:19.540 --> 16:22.580
anyone coming in between
Bianca and Darien.

16:23.670 --> 16:24.960
Bianca!

16:24.960 --> 16:26.250
Hey, Trey!

16:29.670 --> 16:34.330
Oh, no! Trey Appleton Jr.
is cheating on you!

16:35.960 --> 16:37.170
I'm sorry.

16:43.290 --> 16:46.500
So, what did you
do last night?

16:46.500 --> 16:50.330
I was just at home
all alone, catching up
on my reality TV.

16:50.330 --> 16:52.500
Guilty pleasures.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.040
I saw you with Bianca.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.330
Uh, fine. The truth is

16:57.330 --> 16:59.460
when we went
on our double date,

16:59.460 --> 17:01.290
you spent so much time
talking to Darien

17:01.290 --> 17:03.380
that Bianca and I got
to know each other.

17:03.380 --> 17:05.250
Long story short,
we're soulmates

17:05.250 --> 17:07.380
who have been secretly dating
ever since.

17:07.380 --> 17:10.120
What, are you telling me
Bianca is cheating on Darien?

17:10.120 --> 17:14.170
I guess he just doesn't fulfill
her the way Trey Appleton does!

17:15.500 --> 17:17.750
Great, well, now I need
to tell Darien the truth

17:17.750 --> 17:19.250
before he gets hurt again.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.170
And you know what,
Howard, you do realize

17:21.170 --> 17:24.330
that she doesn't like you,
she likes Trey Appleton Jr.,

17:24.330 --> 17:27.460
somebody who doesn't
actually exist?

17:27.460 --> 17:30.500
Every relationship
has issues, KC.

17:34.670 --> 17:37.540
Behold, the Great Pete-dini

17:37.540 --> 17:42.670
will now pull a live rabbit
out of his hat.

17:42.670 --> 17:46.540
Fin-nin-nin-nin-nin!

17:46.540 --> 17:49.040
Ew. Poor Mr. Fluffy.

17:49.040 --> 17:51.750
Uh, moving right along.

17:53.120 --> 17:57.250
I will now saw
Diane in half!

17:57.250 --> 17:59.460
I can't let him
go through with this.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.540
He could seriously hurt her.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.830
Wait! You can't do this.

18:03.830 --> 18:08.500
Judy, stop trying to ruin my act
'cause you're jealous!

18:08.500 --> 18:10.960
I'm not jealous.
It's just that--

18:15.420 --> 18:18.460
Okay, I am jealous.

18:18.460 --> 18:21.380
Petey, you're my best friend.

18:21.380 --> 18:23.830
I wanna be your assistant.

18:23.830 --> 18:25.620
I wanna be sawed in half.

18:25.620 --> 18:28.250
If that's okay with Diane.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.500
Are you kidding me?
That was my rabbit!

18:30.500 --> 18:33.620
I'm not letting him near me
with that saw.

18:33.620 --> 18:36.460
Diane, there's no easy way
to say this.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.460
(cheering, laughing)

18:46.460 --> 18:48.580
Hey, uh, Darien,
can I talk to you
for a second?

18:48.580 --> 18:51.500
(muffled)
Not a good time.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.000
Uh, yeah, I can't
really understand you

18:53.000 --> 18:54.790
with the fries
in your mouth,

18:54.790 --> 18:57.380
so I'm just gonna assume
you said, "Sure, let's talk."

19:02.460 --> 19:04.880
Look, I really need
to talk to you about some stuff.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.460
KC, stop. You and I
are not together.

19:07.460 --> 19:09.420
We're not even
really friends.

19:09.420 --> 19:10.920
I don't need to know
anything, right?

19:10.920 --> 19:12.540
Trey's not my boyfriend.

19:14.960 --> 19:16.330
I pretended that he was

19:16.330 --> 19:18.460
because I wanted
to hang out with you,

19:18.460 --> 19:19.710
and you said that you
had a girlfriend,

19:19.710 --> 19:21.170
so then I said
I had a boyfriend.

19:21.170 --> 19:22.830
And the next thing you know
we're having

19:22.830 --> 19:25.250
the most awkward double date
in the whole world,

19:25.250 --> 19:28.960
and, at least,
I know it was for me,

19:28.960 --> 19:31.750
because I still like you.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.750
KC, I should probably
tell you that--

19:35.750 --> 19:37.290
No-- Let me finish, okay?

19:37.290 --> 19:40.120
The worst part is
Trey and Bianca...

19:41.670 --> 19:43.380
they're cheating on us.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.120
Well, I mean...

19:45.120 --> 19:47.040
technically Bianca's
cheating on you

19:47.040 --> 19:49.460
because I'm
not really with Trey,
but that's not the point.

19:49.460 --> 19:53.460
The point is it's my fault
because I introduced them,

19:53.460 --> 19:54.920
and now once again
I hurt you,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.670
and you probably
hate my guts

19:56.670 --> 19:59.670
because you're
probably heartbroken.

19:59.670 --> 20:02.540
(hissing laughter)

20:02.540 --> 20:04.580
Okay, you cry funny.

20:06.710 --> 20:09.580
KC, I've gotta tell
you something.

20:09.580 --> 20:12.330
Bianca is my cousin.

20:12.330 --> 20:15.170
Ew, you're dating
your cousin?

20:15.170 --> 20:17.170
No. No, of course not.

20:17.170 --> 20:19.460
She was pretending
to be my girlfriend.

20:19.460 --> 20:21.460
Ew, that's still gross.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.880
When you told me you
wanted to hang out again,

20:25.880 --> 20:27.540
I guess I panicked.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.500
The last time, KC...

20:31.710 --> 20:33.380
you really hurt me,

20:33.380 --> 20:35.830
so I just said I was
with someone else.

20:35.830 --> 20:39.290
Wow, I cannot believe
you lied to me about Bianca.

20:40.710 --> 20:43.380
Really, KC? Really?

20:45.040 --> 20:47.620
Okay, I forgive you.

20:47.620 --> 20:50.170
I'm sorry
about the Trey thing.

20:50.170 --> 20:52.620
Well, in retrospect,
I guess it makes sense.

20:52.620 --> 20:55.920
But he didn't really
seem like your type.

20:57.670 --> 21:00.830
That's 'cause he's not,
but you are.

21:05.170 --> 21:08.580
Okay, so you really don't
want to have anything
to do with me, do you?

21:08.580 --> 21:11.710
(sighs)
That's the problem.

21:11.710 --> 21:14.920
I can't help it,
but I do.

21:16.210 --> 21:18.330
But I'm also scared.

21:18.330 --> 21:21.420
So maybe
we can take it slow,

21:21.420 --> 21:22.830
like, real slow.

21:22.830 --> 21:26.000
Like, maybe we can
just try being friends,

21:26.000 --> 21:28.790
and then we'll see
how that goes. Hmm?

21:28.790 --> 21:31.540
All right, yeah,
I'm cool with that.

21:31.540 --> 21:34.540
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:34.540 --> 21:36.750
(whooping)

21:36.750 --> 21:37.750
Cut it out!

21:40.710 --> 21:41.750
Rob, your name's on TV.
