12:24.047 --> 12:26.962
she covers the eggs
in a protective sac

12:27.006 --> 12:30.183
and attaches it to a leaf
or twig out of danger.

12:30.226 --> 12:32.490
Now, if she's done
her job correctly,

12:32.533 --> 12:36.668
in few months, she'll have
several hundred offspring.

12:36.711 --> 12:39.496
You know, we should
make some model egg sacs

12:39.540 --> 12:41.238
for the science fair.

12:41.282 --> 12:43.500
Who would like to help me
do that after school?

12:43.544 --> 12:44.546
Oh!
Oh!
Oh! Oh!

12:47.984 --> 12:49.332
Good.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.730
Hot dog surprise.
Be still my heart.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.341
Call me old-fashioned--

12:57.384 --> 12:59.691
I don't want any more
surprises in my hot dogs.

12:59.735 --> 13:01.389
I wonder what
she sees in me.

13:01.432 --> 13:02.956
It's probably
the quiet good looks

13:02.999 --> 13:04.566
coupled with a certain
smoky magnetism.

13:06.001 --> 13:07.524
Miss French.

13:07.568 --> 13:09.004
You two are probably
a little too young to understand

13:09.048 --> 13:11.051
what an older woman
would see in a younger man.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.486
Oh, I understand.

13:12.529 --> 13:14.053
Good.

13:14.096 --> 13:15.359
A younger man is
too dumb to wonder

13:15.403 --> 13:17.578
why an older woman can't
find someone her own age

13:17.621 --> 13:20.364
and too desperate to care about
the surgical improvements.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.844
What surgical improvements?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.846
Well, he is young.

13:23.889 --> 13:26.022
And so terribly innocent.

13:26.066 --> 13:28.328
Hey, those that can, do.

13:28.371 --> 13:32.768
Those that can't,
laugh at those who can do.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.118
Got to carb up for my one-on-one
with Miss French today.

13:35.162 --> 13:37.686
When's yours?
Oh, right, tomorrow.

13:37.729 --> 13:40.863
You came in second.
I came in first.

13:40.907 --> 13:44.432
Guess that's what they call
natural selection.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.433
Guess it's what
they call a rehearsal.

13:46.476 --> 13:47.565
Rehearsal. [chuckles]

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
Excuse you!

13:52.918 --> 13:54.355
Medically prescribed lunch.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.835
My doctor ships it daily.

13:55.878 --> 13:58.663
I'll only be here as long
as I can hold my breath.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.100
[screams]

14:02.841 --> 14:04.495
His head! His head!

14:04.538 --> 14:06.453
Oh, my God,
where's his head?

14:16.551 --> 14:18.945
Here.

14:18.988 --> 14:20.860
Drink this.

14:20.903 --> 14:22.034
No, thank you.

14:23.078 --> 14:24.254
XANDER:
I've never seen--

14:24.298 --> 14:28.823
I mean, I've never seen
anything like--

14:28.868 --> 14:30.173
That was new.

14:30.216 --> 14:32.044
Who'd want to hurt
Dr. Gregory?

14:32.087 --> 14:35.482
Uh, he didn't have
any enemies on the staff

14:35.525 --> 14:36.701
that I'm aware of.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.921
He was a... a civilized man.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.618
I liked him.

14:40.662 --> 14:43.011
So did I.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.927
Well, we're going to find
out who did this.

14:44.971 --> 14:47.495
We'll find them,
and we'll stop them.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.888
Count on it.

14:48.931 --> 14:50.411
What do we know?

14:50.453 --> 14:53.413
Oh, not a lot.
Um, he was killed on campus.

14:53.456 --> 14:54.894
I'm guessing
the last day we saw him.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.504
How do you work that out?

14:56.547 --> 14:58.461
He didn't change
his clothing.

14:58.505 --> 15:01.465
This is a question that no one
particularly wants to hear,

15:01.509 --> 15:03.640
but where did
they put his head?

15:03.684 --> 15:06.861
Good point. I didn't
want to hear that.

15:06.905 --> 15:08.645
Angel.

15:08.690 --> 15:09.951
He warned me that
something was coming.

15:09.995 --> 15:12.302
Yes. Yes, he did,
didn't he?

15:12.346 --> 15:13.650
I wish I knew
what he meant.

15:13.695 --> 15:14.652
I've been trying to gather
more information

15:14.696 --> 15:15.740
about the master,

15:15.783 --> 15:19.004
our, uh, local vampire king.

15:19.048 --> 15:21.658
There was one oblique reference
to a... a-a vampire

15:21.702 --> 15:24.619
who displeased the master and
cut his hand off in penance.

15:24.662 --> 15:27.187
Cut off his hand and
replaced it with a fork?

15:27.230 --> 15:28.623
I don't know what
he replaced it with.

15:28.666 --> 15:30.232
So why would he come
after a teacher?

15:30.277 --> 15:32.495
I'm not certain he did.

15:32.539 --> 15:35.803
There was an incident
two nights ago

15:35.846 --> 15:39.111
involving a homeless person
in Weatherly Park.

15:39.154 --> 15:40.243
He was practically
shredded,

15:40.287 --> 15:43.681
but, uh, nothing
like Dr. Gregory.

15:43.725 --> 15:45.552
Fork guy doesn't do heads.

15:45.596 --> 15:47.423
Not historically.

15:47.467 --> 15:49.077
And Dr. Gregory's
blood wasn't drained.

15:49.121 --> 15:50.384
So, there's something else
out there

15:50.427 --> 15:52.515
besides Silverware Man?

15:52.559 --> 15:54.996
Oh, this is fun.
We're on Monster Island.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.606
We're on a hellmouth.

15:56.650 --> 15:59.306
It's a center of
mystical convergence.

15:59.349 --> 16:00.784
Guess it's the same thing.

16:00.828 --> 16:03.918
Well, unpleasant things do
gravitate here, it's true,

16:03.962 --> 16:06.269
but we don't know that there's
anything besides this chap.

16:06.312 --> 16:07.618
He's still a likely suspect.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.317
Where was that guy killed,
Weatherly Park?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.884
Buffy,
I know you're upset,

16:12.927 --> 16:14.408
but this is no time
to go hunting.

16:14.451 --> 16:15.756
Not until we know more.

16:15.799 --> 16:17.715
Please promise me
you won't do anything rash.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.153
Cross my heart.

16:28.943 --> 16:29.945
[grunts]

16:56.971 --> 16:59.582
[slurring]: Shouldn't be out
here at night, little lady.

16:59.626 --> 17:00.671
It's dangerous.

17:14.597 --> 17:15.945
[snoring, quiet grunting]

17:36.142 --> 17:40.319
[dog barks in distance]

17:54.376 --> 17:55.335
[growls]

17:55.377 --> 17:57.902
[screams]

17:57.945 --> 17:58.859
[grunting]

17:58.903 --> 18:00.252
Oh!

18:00.296 --> 18:00.817
Ahh!

18:00.862 --> 18:02.080
[blows thudding]

18:06.172 --> 18:08.260
[grunts]Aah!

18:11.133 --> 18:12.874
[grunting]

18:12.916 --> 18:14.135
[snarling]

18:14.180 --> 18:15.789
[grunts]

18:15.833 --> 18:17.530
MAN:
Hold it! Police!

18:17.574 --> 18:18.792
Did you see that?

18:18.836 --> 18:20.098
I got nothin' here.

18:21.883 --> 18:23.363
MAN: I heard him.
Spread out.

18:23.405 --> 18:24.406
Let's go over here.
This way. This way.

18:27.192 --> 18:28.280
[raspy, low breathing]

18:40.902 --> 18:41.945
[grunts]

18:46.125 --> 18:48.387
[hissing]

18:50.172 --> 18:52.869
[low, raspy breathing]

19:12.151 --> 19:13.673
GILES:
You went hunting last night?

19:13.717 --> 19:15.762
Yes.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.286
When you assured me
you wouldn't.

19:17.329 --> 19:19.680
Yes. I lied. I'm a bad person.
Let's move on.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.117
Did you see someone
with a fork?

19:23.162 --> 19:25.163
More like a jumbo claw.

19:26.643 --> 19:27.904
Oh.

19:27.949 --> 19:30.038
Well, at least you're not hurt.

19:30.080 --> 19:31.386
And I saw something else,

19:31.431 --> 19:32.823
something
much more interesting

19:32.866 --> 19:34.825
than your average
run-of-the-mill killer vampire.

19:34.868 --> 19:36.131
Oh?

19:36.174 --> 19:37.349
Do you know Miss French,

19:37.393 --> 19:38.438
the teacher that's
subbing for Dr. Gregory?

19:38.480 --> 19:40.527
Yes. Yes, she's lovely.

19:40.569 --> 19:43.921
Well, in a-a... a common,
extremely well-proportioned way.

19:43.964 --> 19:45.967
Well, I'm chasing
Claw Guy last night,

19:46.009 --> 19:48.143
and Miss Well-Proportioned
is heading home.

19:48.186 --> 19:50.101
Well, Claw Guy takes
one look at her

19:50.144 --> 19:51.232
and runs screaming
for cover.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.669
He what?

19:52.712 --> 19:53.844
Ran away?

19:53.887 --> 19:54.932
He was petrified.

19:54.976 --> 19:55.932
Of Miss French?

19:55.977 --> 19:57.107
Uh-huh.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.719
So I'm an undead monster

19:58.761 --> 20:01.112
that can shave
with my hand...

20:01.155 --> 20:02.592
How many things
am I afraid of?

20:02.635 --> 20:05.334
Not many. And not substitute
teachers, as a rule.

20:05.377 --> 20:06.814
So what's her deal?

20:06.856 --> 20:08.729
I think perhaps it
would be a good idea

20:08.771 --> 20:10.251
if we kept an eye on her.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.079
And I better get to class.

20:17.040 --> 20:19.305
You were there.
You saw Dr. Gregory, didn't you?

20:19.347 --> 20:21.480
Um, you mean yesterday
in the cafeteria

20:21.523 --> 20:22.960
when we found him...

20:23.003 --> 20:25.484
Don't say dead or decapitated
or decomposing.

20:25.528 --> 20:26.963
I'd stay away from
"d" words altogether,

20:27.008 --> 20:28.096
but you witnessed the event,
so this way, please.

20:28.138 --> 20:29.618
Oh, no. I'm gonna be
late for biology.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.142
Extremely late.

20:31.185 --> 20:32.448
You have to see
a counselor.

20:32.491 --> 20:34.015
Everyone who saw the body

20:34.057 --> 20:35.277
has to see
a crisis counselor.

20:35.320 --> 20:36.278
But I really don't--

20:36.322 --> 20:38.148
We all need help
with our feelings,

20:38.192 --> 20:39.412
otherwise we bottle them up,

20:39.454 --> 20:40.500
and before you know it,

20:40.542 --> 20:42.109
powerful laxatives
are involved.

20:42.153 --> 20:44.765
I really believe if we all
reach out to one another,

20:44.807 --> 20:45.940
we can beat this thing.

20:45.982 --> 20:47.594
I'm always here
if you need a hug--

20:47.636 --> 20:49.029
but not a real hug,

20:49.073 --> 20:50.465
because there's no
touching in this school.

20:50.509 --> 20:51.641
We're sensitive
to wrong touching.

20:51.684 --> 20:52.816
But I really, really--

20:52.859 --> 20:55.297
No. You have to talk
to a counselor

20:55.340 --> 20:56.777
and start the healing.
You have to heal.

20:56.819 --> 20:58.125
But Mr. Flutie, I d--Heal.

21:03.479 --> 21:04.698
I don't know
what to say.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.134
It was really, I mean...

21:06.176 --> 21:08.309
one minute you're
in your normal life,

21:08.354 --> 21:10.311
and then who's
in the fridge?

21:10.355 --> 21:12.314
It really gets to you,
a thing like that.

21:12.357 --> 21:14.010
It was...

21:14.055 --> 21:15.535
Let's just say

21:15.577 --> 21:18.319
I haven't been able to eat
a thing since yesterday.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.583
I think I lost,
like, 7.5 ounces--

21:20.626 --> 21:22.150
Way swifter than
that so-called diet

21:22.192 --> 21:23.846
that quack put me on.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.807
Oh, I'm not saying that we
should kill a teacher every day,

21:26.849 --> 21:28.025
just so I can lose weight,

21:28.068 --> 21:30.332
I'm just saying
when tragedy strikes,

21:30.375 --> 21:32.726
we have to look on the
bright side, you know?

21:32.769 --> 21:36.295
Like, how even used Mercedes
still have leather seats.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.252
NATALIE:
Keep your eyes

21:38.297 --> 21:39.732
straight ahead...

21:39.776 --> 21:41.256
on your own test.

21:48.394 --> 21:52.180
I think you meant
"pollination" for number 14.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.838
I'll see you here
after school.

22:01.406 --> 22:03.233
Oh, great.
A pop quiz.

22:17.030 --> 22:19.032
No, I'm not saying
she craned her neck.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.339
We are talking full-on
Exorcisttwist.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.515
Ouch.

22:22.557 --> 22:24.255
Which reminds me--

22:24.298 --> 22:25.821
how come Blayne, who worked
with her one-one-one yesterday,

22:25.865 --> 22:27.606
isn't here today?

22:27.650 --> 22:28.955
Inquiring minds
want to know.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.000
Hm. Any luck?

22:31.219 --> 22:32.741
Um, I've not found
any creature, as yet,

22:32.786 --> 22:35.179
that strikes terror
in a vampire's heart.

22:35.222 --> 22:36.702
Try looking under things

22:36.746 --> 22:38.269
that can turn their heads
all the way around.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.576
Nothing human
can do that.

22:40.619 --> 22:42.403
No. Nothing human.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.406
But there are some
insects that can.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.887
Whatever she is,
I'm gonna be ready for her.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.238
What are you going to do?

22:50.280 --> 22:52.066
My homework.

22:58.811 --> 23:01.291
Where are the books on bugs?

23:04.948 --> 23:06.340
[door closes]

23:06.384 --> 23:08.169
Hi.
Oh, hi.

23:08.211 --> 23:10.605
I was just
grabbing a snack.

23:10.650 --> 23:11.780
Can I fix you
something?

23:11.825 --> 23:12.826
No, thanks.

23:12.868 --> 23:14.871
I never eat when I'm
making egg sacs.

23:14.914 --> 23:16.089
[laughs]

23:16.133 --> 23:17.439
Wow. If this were real,
the bugs would be--

23:17.482 --> 23:18.440
Big as you.

23:18.483 --> 23:19.962
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

23:20.007 --> 23:21.922
So where do we start?

23:21.964 --> 23:23.227
Oh, Xander...

23:23.270 --> 23:26.491
I've done something
really stupid.

23:26.535 --> 23:27.753
I hope you can forgive me.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.625
Oh, forgiveness
is my middle name.

23:29.669 --> 23:31.018
Actually, it's Lavelle,

23:31.060 --> 23:32.411
and I'd appreciate it
if you guard that secret

23:32.453 --> 23:33.586
with your life.

23:33.628 --> 23:35.457
[chuckles]

23:35.500 --> 23:38.112
I have a teachers' conference
in half an hour,

23:38.154 --> 23:41.984
and I left the paint
and papier-maché at home.

23:42.028 --> 23:44.727
I don't suppose you'd like
to come to my place tonight

23:44.770 --> 23:46.119
to work on it there?

23:46.163 --> 23:47.121
[gulps]

23:47.163 --> 23:49.123
Come to, uh...

23:49.165 --> 23:50.471
your place?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.996
[rock guitar wailing]

23:53.039 --> 23:54.911
7:30?

23:54.954 --> 23:55.912
Here's my address.

23:55.955 --> 23:57.740
[pencil scribbling]

23:59.699 --> 24:01.656
I'll see you tonight.

24:01.701 --> 24:02.701
Yeah.

24:08.403 --> 24:10.012
Ooh, yes!

24:13.799 --> 24:16.237
[crickets chirping]

24:23.766 --> 24:25.201
[crunching]

24:30.685 --> 24:32.296
Dig this.

24:32.339 --> 24:34.864
"The praying mantis can
rotate its head 180 degrees

24:34.907 --> 24:36.865
while waiting for
its next meal to walk by."

24:36.910 --> 24:38.040
Hah!

24:40.566 --> 24:41.740
Well, come on, guys...

24:41.784 --> 24:43.220
Hah.

24:43.263 --> 24:46.528
Well, Miss French
is sort of big for a bug.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.226
And she is by and large
woman-shaped.

24:49.269 --> 24:51.532
Okay. Factoid one:

24:51.576 --> 24:54.536
Only the praying mantis can
rotate its head like that.

24:54.579 --> 24:56.494
Factoid two:
A pretty whacked-out vampire

24:56.538 --> 24:58.060
is scared to death of her.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.541
Factoid three: Her fashion
sense screams predator.

25:00.586 --> 25:02.718
It's the shoulder pads.

25:02.761 --> 25:04.240
Exactly.If you're right,

25:04.285 --> 25:05.241
then she'd have
to be a shape shifter

25:05.286 --> 25:06.634
or a perception
distorter.

25:06.679 --> 25:08.636
Wait a half a mo...

25:08.681 --> 25:10.160
I had a chum at Oxford--
Carlyle.

25:10.203 --> 25:11.509
Advanced degrees

25:11.553 --> 25:13.076
in entomology
and mythology.

25:13.119 --> 25:14.295
Entomo--who?

25:14.337 --> 25:16.252
Bugs and fairy tales.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.516
I knew that.

25:17.558 --> 25:18.820
If I recall correctly,

25:18.865 --> 25:21.737
poor old Carlyle--
just before he went mad--

25:21.780 --> 25:23.086
claimed there was
some beast--
[beeping]

25:23.130 --> 25:25.087
Buffy, 911.

25:25.132 --> 25:26.088
Blayne's mom
called the school.

25:26.133 --> 25:27.438
He never came home
last night.

25:27.481 --> 25:29.396
The boy who worked with
Miss French yesterday?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.834
Yeah. If Miss French
is responsible for--

25:31.877 --> 25:34.270
Xander's supposed to be
helping her right now.

25:34.315 --> 25:36.490
He's got a crush
on a giant insect.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.318
BUFFY: Okay, don't panic.
I'll warn him,

25:38.362 --> 25:40.364
but I need you to hack onto
the coroner's office for me.

25:40.407 --> 25:41.974
Well, what are we
looking for?

25:42.018 --> 25:43.585
Autopsy on Dr. Gregory.

25:43.628 --> 25:44.978
I've been trying to
figure out these marks

25:45.020 --> 25:46.240
that I saw on his corpse.

25:46.282 --> 25:47.546
I'm thinking they were teeth,

25:47.588 --> 25:49.634
and, uh, these cuddlies

25:49.677 --> 25:52.159
should definitely be
brushing after every meal.

25:53.508 --> 25:55.770
And you were saying
something about a beast?

25:55.815 --> 25:57.643
Oh, uh, yeah,
I just need to make

25:57.685 --> 26:00.297
one transatlantic
telephone call.

26:00.340 --> 26:02.865
Um, this computer invasion

26:02.909 --> 26:04.998
that Willow's performing
on the coroner's office.

26:05.040 --> 26:07.042
One assumes
it is entirely legal.

26:07.086 --> 26:08.087
Entirely.
Of course.

26:08.131 --> 26:09.349
Right.

26:09.393 --> 26:11.613
Wasn't here...
Didn't see it...

26:11.656 --> 26:13.483
Couldn't
have stopped you.

26:13.528 --> 26:14.573
Good idea.

26:18.619 --> 26:19.577
Hey...

26:19.621 --> 26:20.578
Hey.

26:20.622 --> 26:23.016
So, how'd it go
with Miss French?

26:23.058 --> 26:24.365
Oh, it's a bit demanding

26:24.407 --> 26:25.496
being her absolute favorite
guy in the universe,

26:25.539 --> 26:27.367
but I'll muddle through.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.195
Xander, she's not
what she seems.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.589
I know.
She's so much more.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.503
Okay, um, I'm gonna
have to tell you

26:33.548 --> 26:34.809
something about her,

26:34.854 --> 26:37.726
and I'm gonna need you
to really listen, okay?

26:37.769 --> 26:39.118
Okay.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.730
I don't think she's human.

26:41.773 --> 26:42.862
I see.

26:42.904 --> 26:44.819
So if she's not
human, she's...

26:44.864 --> 26:46.692
Technically... a big bug.

26:46.734 --> 26:47.953
[laughs]

26:47.997 --> 26:48.911
This sounds really weird.
I'm aware of that--

26:48.954 --> 26:50.259
It doesn't sound
weird at all.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.392
I completely understand.

26:51.434 --> 26:53.612
I've met someone
and you're jealous.

26:53.654 --> 26:54.829
What?

26:54.874 --> 26:55.961
Look, there's nothing
I can do about it.

26:56.005 --> 26:56.962
There's just a
certain chemical thing

26:57.006 --> 26:58.311
between Miss French and me.

26:58.355 --> 26:59.313
I know. I read
all about it.

26:59.355 --> 27:00.880
It's called, um,
a pheromone.

27:00.923 --> 27:03.883
It's a chemical attractant
that insects give off.

27:03.925 --> 27:04.884
She's not an insect.

27:04.926 --> 27:06.232
She's a woman, okay?

27:06.276 --> 27:08.017
And hard as that may be
for you to conceive,

27:08.060 --> 27:10.628
an actual woman
finds me attractive.

27:10.672 --> 27:13.153
I realize it's no mystery guy
handing out leather jackets.

27:13.195 --> 27:15.067
And while we're
on the subject,

27:15.111 --> 27:17.417
what kind of a girly
name is Angel, anyway?

27:17.461 --> 27:18.810
What does that have to do--Nothing!

27:18.854 --> 27:20.463
It just kind of bugs me.

27:20.508 --> 27:22.336
Look, I really gotta...

27:22.378 --> 27:23.380
Wha...?

27:25.686 --> 27:28.037
[sighs]

27:28.080 --> 27:30.083
[mellow jazz music playing]

27:33.781 --> 27:35.305
[doorbell rings]

27:43.923 --> 27:45.358
Hi.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.099
Come on in.

27:47.143 --> 27:48.404
Should I change?

27:48.449 --> 27:49.624
Is-is this too...?

27:49.667 --> 27:52.192
No, no. It's the most
beautiful chest--

27:52.234 --> 27:54.846
dress I've ever seen.

27:54.890 --> 27:55.978
Thank you.

27:56.021 --> 27:57.806
That's sweet.

27:57.849 --> 27:59.067
Martini?

28:02.288 --> 28:04.813
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you like something else?

28:04.856 --> 28:06.380
[chuckles]

28:06.423 --> 28:07.685
I just need
to relax a little.

28:07.729 --> 28:09.688
I'm kind of nervous
around you.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.907
You're probably cool
as a cucumber.

28:12.951 --> 28:15.127
I like cucumbers,
like in that

28:15.171 --> 28:17.086
Greek salad thing
with the yogurt.

28:17.130 --> 28:18.131
You like Greek food?

28:18.173 --> 28:19.522
I'm exempting
shwarma, of course.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.089
I mean, what's that all about?
It's a big meat hive.

28:21.134 --> 28:22.265
[both laugh]

28:24.746 --> 28:26.400
[slurps]

28:26.442 --> 28:29.619
[exhales]

28:29.663 --> 28:31.012
Hell-o!

28:31.057 --> 28:32.188
Cheers.

28:32.231 --> 28:33.537
[glasses clink]

28:34.799 --> 28:36.626
Can I ask you
a personal question?

28:43.460 --> 28:46.462
Have you ever been
with a woman before?

28:46.507 --> 28:49.770
You mean like in,
uh, the same room?

28:49.815 --> 28:51.817
You know what I mean.

28:51.859 --> 28:54.253
Oh, that. Uh...

28:54.297 --> 28:55.733
Well, let me think. Um...

28:55.777 --> 28:59.259
Yeah, there was,
uh, several.

28:59.301 --> 29:01.173
I mean, and, uh...

29:01.217 --> 29:02.784
Quite a few times...

29:02.827 --> 29:08.615
A-And then there was,
uh, oh, she was incredibly...

29:08.659 --> 29:09.790
No. Uh-uh.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.662
I know.

29:11.705 --> 29:13.838
I can tell.

29:13.882 --> 29:14.839
You can?

29:14.883 --> 29:16.363
Oh, I like it.

29:16.405 --> 29:19.713
You might say I need it.

29:19.758 --> 29:21.803
Oh. Well,
needs should, uh...

29:21.846 --> 29:24.326
MAN: Somebody help me!You know, needs
should definitely be met,

29:24.371 --> 29:26.634
I'm down here! Do you hear me?as long as it doesn't require
ointments the next day or...

29:26.676 --> 29:28.330
[chuckles]
Do you hear...

29:28.375 --> 29:29.810
No.

29:29.855 --> 29:30.811
It sounds like
someone crying.

29:30.855 --> 29:32.030
I don't hear anything.

29:33.902 --> 29:37.252
Your hands are so hot.

29:37.297 --> 29:38.993
Ooh, you hurt your hand.

29:40.604 --> 29:43.390
[sighs]

29:43.432 --> 29:44.433
Buffy.

29:46.087 --> 29:48.481
I love Buffy.

29:48.525 --> 29:49.830
Wow.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.876
So that's a martini, huh?

29:51.920 --> 29:53.226
Mm-hmm.

29:54.749 --> 29:55.968
Do you hear--

29:56.010 --> 29:58.665
Would you like to touch me
with those hands?

29:58.709 --> 30:00.667
MAN: I'm down here!
Help me!

30:00.711 --> 30:03.713
Your hands are s...

30:03.758 --> 30:06.805
Really... serrated.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.981
Oh, wow, that martini. I...

30:10.025 --> 30:11.983
Really think I have to...

30:40.403 --> 30:43.842
[chirring, crackling
in distance]

31:02.382 --> 31:04.557
Miss...

31:04.601 --> 31:05.558
French?

31:05.602 --> 31:06.865
[growling]

31:06.907 --> 31:08.736
Please, call me Natalie.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.173
Frankly, madam, I haven't
the faintest idea

31:12.218 --> 31:13.914
what time it is,
nor do I care.

31:13.959 --> 31:15.438
Now, unlock his cell,
unstrap him,

31:15.481 --> 31:16.743
and bring him to the
telephone immediately.

31:16.787 --> 31:18.397
This is a matter
of life and death.

31:18.441 --> 31:19.355
[computer beeps]

31:19.398 --> 31:20.442
WILLOW:
Got it.

31:20.487 --> 31:21.704
Coroner's report...

31:21.749 --> 31:25.361
Complete with-- yuck--
color pictures.

31:25.404 --> 31:27.276
There areteeth marks...

31:27.319 --> 31:29.060
Which match perfectly
the one insect

31:29.104 --> 31:30.452
that nips off
its prey's head.

31:30.497 --> 31:32.280
Okay, I-I don't like this.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.587
[sighs] That's the way
they feed-- head first.

31:34.631 --> 31:35.980
It's also
the way they mate.

31:36.023 --> 31:38.634
The female bites off
the male's head while they're...

31:38.679 --> 31:39.722
No, no, no, see...

31:39.767 --> 31:42.203
Xander is-- I like his head.

31:42.248 --> 31:44.423
It's where you find
his eyes and his hair

31:44.467 --> 31:46.251
and his adorable smile.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.644
Hey, hey,
take it easy, Will.

31:47.688 --> 31:49.907
Xander is not in
any immediate danger.

31:49.951 --> 31:51.473
I saw him leave school.

31:51.518 --> 31:54.520
He's probably safe
at home right now.

32:00.482 --> 32:01.657
Blayne!

32:01.701 --> 32:02.833
Oh, God. Oh, God...

32:02.876 --> 32:04.748
Are you all right?

32:04.791 --> 32:05.967
You gotta
get me outta here.

32:06.010 --> 32:07.750
You gotta. She, she...

32:07.795 --> 32:08.883
she gets you, and, uh...

32:08.926 --> 32:10.666
She... she...What? What does she do?

32:11.711 --> 32:14.019
Oh, God... Oh, no...

32:14.061 --> 32:16.281
Blayne... what does she do?

32:16.325 --> 32:19.372
She, she, she, she takes
you out of the cage,

32:19.414 --> 32:21.200
and she ties you up,
and-and...

32:21.242 --> 32:25.203
she... she starts
moving and throbbing,

32:25.247 --> 32:27.467
and these eggs come
shooting out of her,

32:27.509 --> 32:29.556
and then, and then...What? Then what?

32:29.598 --> 32:31.297
She mates with you.

32:31.339 --> 32:32.993
[panting]

32:33.038 --> 32:34.299
She...

32:34.343 --> 32:36.084
That's not the worst part.That's not?

32:36.127 --> 32:37.999
You seen her teeth? Huh?

32:38.042 --> 32:39.260
Right while she's,
you know,

32:39.305 --> 32:40.871
right-right in the middle of...

32:40.914 --> 32:43.569
I saw her do it.

32:43.613 --> 32:44.614
I don't want to
die like that.

32:44.657 --> 32:47.182
Blayne, Blayne, chill.

32:47.226 --> 32:49.531
It's okay.
It's gonna be okay.

32:49.576 --> 32:50.663
We're getting out of this.

32:50.707 --> 32:52.491
You got a plan?
What is it?

32:53.840 --> 32:55.364
Just, uh,
let me perfect it.

32:55.407 --> 32:56.365
Oh, God.

32:56.409 --> 32:57.410
Oh, God.

32:58.411 --> 32:59.759
Oh, God...

33:01.500 --> 33:03.198
I-I understand, Carlyle.

33:03.241 --> 33:06.288
Yes, I'll take
every precaution.

33:06.332 --> 33:07.681
Absolutely.

33:07.723 --> 33:10.640
No, it sounds exactly like
the creature you describe.

33:10.683 --> 33:14.862
You-you were right,
all along, about everything.

33:14.904 --> 33:16.516

33:27.614 --> 33:29.963

33:30.008 --> 33:31.922
What he discovered,
he kept to himself

33:31.965 --> 33:35.403
until several teenage boys were
murdered in The Cotswolds.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.363

33:37.405 --> 33:38.580

This type of creature, the
kleptes-virgo or virgin-thief,

33:44.631 --> 33:46.633

33:46.675 --> 33:48.677

the Celtic sea-maidens,

33:48.721 --> 33:50.723

from the bones of, uh...

33:50.767 --> 33:52.203
Giles, while we're young.

33:52.247 --> 33:55.510
Well, basically,
the she-mantis

33:55.555 --> 33:57.904
assumes the form
of a beautiful woman

33:57.948 --> 34:00.777
