00:05.680 --> 00:08.880
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:08.960 --> 00:13.480
(Carter) This is Prometheus,
otherwise known as the X-303.

00:14.040 --> 00:17.320
Sir, there's an energy build-up
in the naquadria cells.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.760
The jump must've triggered a surge
that overloaded the control systems.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.280
Stand by to jettison the reactor module.

00:25.640 --> 00:29.400
Even if we plotted a course for Earth
using maximum sublight thrust,

00:29.480 --> 00:30.640
it'd take years.

00:30.720 --> 00:32.240
P3X-744.

00:32.320 --> 00:35.760
If we can gate home from there, we can
get what we need to repair the ship.

00:43.640 --> 00:46.440
So this thing is different
from a nebula. How?

00:46.520 --> 00:49.640
That's why it's so exciting, sir.
We don't know exactly.

00:49.720 --> 00:54.120
And this formation just happens to be
near our next cool-down coordinates?

00:54.200 --> 00:58.280
It'll only be a little bit out of our way,
Colonel. All I ask is two hours, tops.

00:58.360 --> 01:01.200
If only to see the expression
on your face first-hand.

01:01.280 --> 01:04.959
- "Kid" and "candy store" come to mind.
- I'll try to retain my composure.

01:05.040 --> 01:08.960
Just keep in mind that our mission
is to get this bird home in one piece.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.240
(PA) Colonel Ronson, report to the bridge.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.040
Must be time. After you, Major.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.680
Sir, the hyperdrive engines
are at maximum safe temperature.

01:23.760 --> 01:27.720
- Shut 'em down, Major Gant.
- Yes, sir. Dropping out of hyperspace.

01:31.640 --> 01:34.000
Major Carter, what's our progress?

01:34.080 --> 01:37.480
Well, sir, we covered 49 light years
in the last leg.

01:37.560 --> 01:41.400
Considering the hyperdrive was lifted
from an Alkesh, that's pretty good.

01:41.480 --> 01:44.800
It was originally designed
for a ship one-tenth this size.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.840
Only five more of these pit stops
and we're home.

01:47.920 --> 01:49.720
(beeping)

01:49.800 --> 01:53.800
Colonel, a bogey just appeared on
our sensors. Dead ahead, 3,000 clicks.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.040
- Can't you identify it?
- Negative, sir.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.560
It's closing in on us very quickly.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.240
Sound general quarters.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.960
(alarm)

02:05.800 --> 02:10.199
- Bogey's now at 2,000 clicks.
- Raise shields. Arm weapons.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:33.760 --> 03:37.520
Bogey is now at 900 clicks.
It's not slowing down, sir.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.120
How long till we can
jump to hyperspace again?

03:40.200 --> 03:44.080
The hyperdrive needs two hours to cool
down before attempting another jump.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.640
If we try one before that, it could overload.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.840
Colonel, I'm getting some unusual
readings from the alien vessel.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.240
They're scanning us, sir.

04:01.320 --> 04:06.440
Major Gant, set up a wide-frequency
broadcast. I wanna talk to them.

04:07.880 --> 04:09.680
Go ahead, sir.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.120
This is Colonel William Ronson,
commander of the Prometheus.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.480
- Please respond.
- (static)

04:17.880 --> 04:22.560
If you can hear me,
I offer you peaceful greetings.

04:22.640 --> 04:26.480
Bogey is now at 400 clicks and
continuing to gain on our position, sir.

04:26.560 --> 04:30.560
Sir, thermographic sensors are showing
a build-up of energy within the ship.

04:36.400 --> 04:40.400
- Energy build-up is continuing, sir.
- Colonel, we have to get out of here.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.720
Major Gant, initiate
evasive manoeuvre Delta now.

04:43.800 --> 04:45.520
Yes, sir. Executing Delta.

04:59.040 --> 05:02.200
- Major Gant, report.
- Shields are down 69%.

05:02.280 --> 05:04.840
Their weapons are draining our shields.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.960
- 53%.
- Reroute auxiliary power to shields.

05:11.040 --> 05:13.840
Weapons Officer, prepare
to return fire on my command.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.400
Aft missile bays
one through six ready, sir.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.680
Fire one through four now.

05:25.640 --> 05:29.080
Sir, missiles destroyed
before reaching the target.

05:30.800 --> 05:35.680
Alien vessel is still gaining on us, sir.
Shield strength is at 32%.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.840
Fire all missiles at will.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.760
Wait. Suggest diverting auxiliary power
back to the sublight engines.

05:42.840 --> 05:43.640
Major?

05:43.720 --> 05:48.520
The gas cloud. If we can get inside it, it
might make it harder for them to track us.

05:50.920 --> 05:53.040
Shields are below 15%.

05:53.120 --> 05:56.040
Even with engines at full strength,
we'll never make it.

05:56.120 --> 05:59.360
We might be able to make a small
hyperspace jump into the cloud.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.960
Give me a few minutes
to override the safeguards.

06:02.040 --> 06:04.080
You have two.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.200
Come on. One jump.

06:29.000 --> 06:32.920
- Weapon systems no longer operational.
- Shields are below 10%.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.040
Receiving ship-wide
damage reports, Colonel.

07:22.120 --> 07:25.120
This is Major Carter calling the bridge.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.640
Bridge, please respond.

08:14.400 --> 08:17.560
This is the bridge calling all decks.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.640
Please respond.

08:46.360 --> 08:50.800
This is Major Samantha Carter of
the US Air Force vessel Prometheus.

08:50.880 --> 08:56.000
As the sole remaining crew member, I feel
compelled to keep a log of these events.

08:56.080 --> 08:58.400
After being attacked
by a hostile alien ship,

08:58.480 --> 09:01.120
I sustained an injury
and lost consciousness.

09:01.200 --> 09:05.400
When I awoke,
I found the ship devoid of all crew.

09:05.480 --> 09:09.280
An initial systems review indicated
the hyperdrive to be operational.

09:09.360 --> 09:14.560
But the sublight engines remain offline,
possibly due to damage from the attack.

09:14.640 --> 09:19.920
I am hopeful further investigation
will provide more answers.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.440
However, my first priority
is to find out what happened to the crew.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.000
Having searched the ship
and found no one,

09:29.080 --> 09:33.760
only one possibility remains
to explain their disappearance.

09:53.360 --> 09:56.200
Since all the ship's escape pods
have been jettisoned,

09:56.280 --> 10:00.240
I must assume an evacuation order
was given after my losing consciousness.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.120
In the chaos that must have ensued,
I was left behind.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.800
(engines start up)

10:12.080 --> 10:13.600
(engines shut down)

10:14.080 --> 10:16.080
The sublight engines remain offline.

10:16.160 --> 10:20.000
I guess something about the gas cloud
is prohibiting restart procedures.

10:20.080 --> 10:23.440
Thus far, I have been unable
to find a way around this problem.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.560
Without sublight engine power
to manoeuvre the ship,

10:27.640 --> 10:30.640
I'm left with only one other option.

10:56.120 --> 10:58.120
Damn it.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.720
Major Carter.

11:05.800 --> 11:08.360
- Teal'c?
- Hear me.

11:08.440 --> 11:11.840
You must remain conscious at all costs.

11:13.120 --> 11:16.600
- I just need to rest for a while.
- You cannot.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.600
Listen to me.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.680
You are injured.
If you sleep, you will die.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.760
Do you understand?

11:27.080 --> 11:29.320
I know...

11:29.400 --> 11:33.920
If you sleep, you will die.

12:05.040 --> 12:10.760
(child) * Twinkle, twinkle, little star

12:11.400 --> 12:17.080
* How I wonder what you are

12:17.360 --> 12:22.720
* Up above the world so high

12:24.040 --> 12:29.760
- Is someone there?
- * Like a diamond in the sky

12:30.680 --> 12:35.280
* Twinkle, twinkle, little star

12:35.360 --> 12:36.160
Hello?

12:36.240 --> 12:41.840
* How I wonder what you are

12:41.920 --> 12:43.920
(footsteps)

12:50.840 --> 12:52.400
OK...

12:57.040 --> 13:00.560
I have sent out a distress signal
detailing Prometheus's situation

13:00.640 --> 13:02.880
and our last known position in space.

13:02.960 --> 13:05.600
I know it may be hundreds of years
before it is heard.

13:07.600 --> 13:10.280
That said, Stargate Command
was aware of our route

13:10.360 --> 13:14.520
and will undoubtedly do
everything they can to mount a rescue.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.800
And if any of the crew survived,

13:16.880 --> 13:20.040
I can only hope they will
eventually send help as well.

13:20.120 --> 13:25.520
Therefore I feel my best course of action
is to settle in for the long haul.

13:30.400 --> 13:34.360
By my calculations, I have enough
food and water to last several months.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.920
With further rationing,
it might be possible to double that.

13:44.680 --> 13:47.520
Play with me.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.640
I've been trying to understand why
the ship is unable to jump hyperspace.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.320
During my last attempt,

14:10.400 --> 14:14.120
the hyperspace window seemed
too unstable for the ship to enter it.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.840
Thus far, sensors have been unable
to identify the content of the cloud itself.

14:18.920 --> 14:24.120
It's more likely made up of a denser group
of gases than that of a typical nebula.

14:24.200 --> 14:29.000
It's preventing the hyperdrive emitter
from transferring power at an even rate.

14:29.080 --> 14:33.200
Until that changes, the Prometheus
will remain trapped here indefinitely.

14:33.280 --> 14:37.080
(Daniel) Yep! I'd say you're stuck all right.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.600
You've been running the same
diagnostic program for four hours.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.360
What makes you think the results
are suddenly gonna change?

14:51.440 --> 14:53.840
Sam! Hello?

14:54.600 --> 14:56.880
Were you this annoying
when you were ascended?

14:56.960 --> 15:02.360
Depends who you ask. I thought I had a
certain je ne sais quoi. Timing was so-so.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.280
No offence, but I really
don't have time for this.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.240
This is ridiculous. You aren't even real.

15:14.320 --> 15:18.520
Well, I'm not so much me
as I am... you, really.

15:18.600 --> 15:21.120
I mean, part of your subconscious mind.

15:21.200 --> 15:23.400
So am I real?

15:23.480 --> 15:28.440
That's up to you, I guess. The Socratic
implications are quite fascinating.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.200
- Daniel...
- You just need some help, that's all.

15:32.280 --> 15:34.880
Can't you just try to go along with this?

15:37.520 --> 15:40.080
You're me, talking to me.

15:40.960 --> 15:43.080
Yeah, basically.

15:44.960 --> 15:48.040
All right. You have a point.
I could use some help.

15:48.120 --> 15:50.120
Thank you.

15:53.080 --> 15:56.920
OK, what do you... I want?

15:57.000 --> 15:58.680
Well...

15:58.760 --> 16:01.840
- I think you're going about this all wrong.
- This is helping?

16:01.920 --> 16:04.400
You've waited weeks
to study this gas cloud.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.440
Isn't that the real reason
you volunteered for this job?

16:07.520 --> 16:09.520
Now you're here, finally here,

16:09.600 --> 16:12.880
and you're wasting your time
running hyperdrive simulations.

16:12.960 --> 16:18.080
In case you hadn't noticed, I've got
a small problem, Daniel. I'm stranded.

16:18.160 --> 16:21.360
Inside the thing you've looked at
through a telescope for years.

16:21.440 --> 16:26.000
It's a chance to study something rare
and exciting up close. Seize the moment!

16:26.080 --> 16:27.480
Seize the moment?

16:27.560 --> 16:31.240
It's something new
that we've never encountered before...

16:31.320 --> 16:34.040
You're ignoring it.

16:34.120 --> 16:36.200
Does that sound like you?

16:38.280 --> 16:42.760
Daniel, I can't even think straight,
let alone stay awake.

16:44.240 --> 16:47.600
Sam... you have to check this out.

16:47.680 --> 16:50.440
Trust me. It's important.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.760
(ship creaking)

17:18.480 --> 17:20.480
(creaking)

17:39.520 --> 17:41.520
Oh, my God...

17:59.840 --> 18:01.640
Oh!

18:08.880 --> 18:11.200
- You hear about Sam?
- Yeah.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.280
Doesn't sound good.

18:14.800 --> 18:20.640
18 hours past due for contact.
Yeah, I'd say something went wrong.

18:23.040 --> 18:26.440
I made a list of planets with Stargates
in range of the Prometheus route.

18:26.520 --> 18:30.600
General Hammond has agreed to send
SG teams to all of them, including us.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.640
Why?

18:32.720 --> 18:36.800
If something went wrong, they might
be able to make it to a planet with a gate.

18:36.880 --> 18:40.440
At which time, they would gate home,
wouldn't they?

18:40.520 --> 18:43.040
When the hyperdrive failed
on the maiden voyage,

18:43.120 --> 18:47.640
you were nearly stranded on P7X-009.
They didn't know where the gate was.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.960
Sounds like a long shot.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.840
Unfortunately the Tok'ra
are unable to send a ship now.

18:52.920 --> 18:57.040
They promise to retrace the route as soon
as they can, but visiting these planets is...

18:57.120 --> 18:58.520
What?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.880
Is what?

19:01.320 --> 19:03.360
Is something.

19:06.320 --> 19:07.720
Yeah.

19:16.800 --> 19:19.120
Ship's log update.
I have discovered

19:19.200 --> 19:23.840
that sections of the hull are being
corroded by the gases in this cloud.

19:23.920 --> 19:26.720
Although I have boosted
power to our shields,

19:26.800 --> 19:30.000
it has had little effect
on protecting the ship.

19:30.080 --> 19:32.600
(creaking)

19:34.840 --> 19:37.840
I've sealed off those sections
affected by the corrosion,

19:37.920 --> 19:40.160
but it's only a stopgap measure.

19:40.240 --> 19:44.080
All I know for certain is, if I can't
find a way to stop it from spreading,

19:44.160 --> 19:47.960
the ship's hull will
eventually be breached.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.960
"When the blazing sun is gone,

19:51.040 --> 19:53.960
when he nothing shines upon..."

19:57.360 --> 20:00.560
Who are you? What do you want?

20:00.640 --> 20:02.520
"Then you show your little light,

20:02.600 --> 20:05.280
twinkle, twinkle, all the night."

20:05.360 --> 20:07.600
Come on. This way.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.840
Wait...

20:13.720 --> 20:15.960
Samantha.

20:16.040 --> 20:18.240
Teal'c, did you see...

20:19.800 --> 20:23.000
- Of course you didn't.
- I'm here to warn you.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.680
- I know. I have to stay awake.
- That's not all.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.200
Everything may not be as it seems.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.520
The fact that I'm talking to someone
who isn't really here kinda speaks to that.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.840
On the contrary.
I think it's you that's not here.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.360
What?

20:41.440 --> 20:46.680
I believe you and the other crew members
are being held aboard the alien vessel.

20:46.760 --> 20:50.840
- How do you know?
- It is possible they are probing your mind.

20:50.920 --> 20:55.120
If so, any information obtained
may be used to attack Earth.

20:55.200 --> 20:57.200
Hold on...

20:58.440 --> 21:01.720
Even if you're right
and I'm not really here,

21:01.800 --> 21:04.160
what am I supposed to do about it?

21:04.240 --> 21:06.000
Nothing.

21:06.080 --> 21:08.160
Teal'c, give me something here.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.160
Very well.

21:10.240 --> 21:12.600
As you attempt to repair
the ship's engines,

21:12.680 --> 21:18.640
you may inadvertently be divulging vital
information on Prometheus technology.

21:18.720 --> 21:22.120
I do believe it would be
prudent to do nothing.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.600
I can't do that, Teal'c.

21:28.040 --> 21:30.040
Be careful, Samantha.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.520
Wait! Where are you going?

21:33.800 --> 21:37.520
You're wrong, Teal'c.
I'm not on an alien ship.

21:37.600 --> 21:39.600
I'm right here.

21:45.800 --> 21:47.800
(groans)

21:49.200 --> 21:51.400
This is real.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.960
Ow! This is real.

22:07.520 --> 22:10.520
The effects of my head injury
are getting worse.

22:10.600 --> 22:13.400
I'm not sure how much longer I can last.

22:14.360 --> 22:19.400
My only hope of survival is to somehow
free the Prometheus from this gas cloud

22:19.480 --> 22:23.720
without using either
the sublight or hyperdrive engines.

22:23.800 --> 22:28.080
I think I've come up with a way.
It has its risks.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.840
(alarm)

22:37.800 --> 22:40.560
By venting several levels
of pressurised atmosphere,

22:40.640 --> 22:43.920
I am hoping to generate enough
propulsion to move the ship.

22:51.520 --> 22:53.480
(creaking)

22:57.640 --> 23:00.000
Come on.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.080
No!

23:17.840 --> 23:19.840
Hello?

23:21.080 --> 23:23.080
Are you here?

23:30.680 --> 23:32.960
Hey!

23:33.040 --> 23:36.120
Have I told you my latest theory?
It's really cool.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.080
Lose something?

23:42.160 --> 23:43.800
- Did you see a...
- Little girl?

23:43.880 --> 23:45.640
- Yeah.
- No.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.920
- You know, you don't look so good.
- Yeah.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.720
Anyway, about my theory.

23:52.800 --> 23:57.080
What if this cloud isn't so much
a collection of corrosive gases

23:57.160 --> 24:00.040
as it is a sentient being?

24:00.120 --> 24:03.000
I'm saying the cloud is alive, Sam.

24:05.320 --> 24:08.200
- The cloud is alive?
- Yeah. It's a sentient being,

24:08.280 --> 24:13.440
like... feelings, memories.
A space-borne alien entity, if you will.

24:14.880 --> 24:18.920
- That's crazy.
- Why else would it be corroding the ship?

24:19.000 --> 24:20.920
Because the gases are corrosive.

24:21.000 --> 24:24.760
Or maybe we somehow offended it
when we flew inside of it.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.000
The point is, if we talk to it...

24:28.080 --> 24:30.880
maybe it'll let us go.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.320
You want me to talk to the cloud?

24:34.480 --> 24:36.680
Would it kill you to try?

24:36.760 --> 24:41.040
- How would I do that?
- You said there's a little girl on the ship.

24:41.120 --> 24:45.800
Maybe that little girl is the physical
personification of the cloud.

24:45.880 --> 24:50.400
Just go with me on this. Maybe that's
its way of trying to communicate with us.

24:50.480 --> 24:53.440
Daniel...

24:53.520 --> 24:55.520
This isn't helping.

24:57.760 --> 25:00.200
Talk to her, Sam.

25:01.040 --> 25:06.080
(girl) * Like a diamond in the sky

25:06.680 --> 25:12.400
* Twinkle, twinkle, little star

25:12.480 --> 25:18.480
* How I wonder what you are

25:25.280 --> 25:29.280
- My mother used to sing that to me.
- How obscure.

25:31.000 --> 25:35.440
- I'm so tired.
- You can't sleep. Not yet.

25:35.520 --> 25:38.440
- Why?
- Because we need to talk.

25:55.240 --> 25:58.440
Eat. You need to keep your strength up.

26:00.600 --> 26:04.600
- Do you have a name?
- I'm Grace.

26:06.120 --> 26:08.560
- Who are you?
- You know.

26:09.880 --> 26:11.880
No, I don't know.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.360
I'm your father.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.120
Dad?

26:18.200 --> 26:22.200
I know it sounds corny,
but you get to an age...

26:25.160 --> 26:31.560
You get to an age where you think about
everything you did wrong as a parent.

26:34.600 --> 26:39.480
- Don't take this the wrong way...
- I know. I don't look so good.

26:42.040 --> 26:45.120
I wanted so many things for you, Sam,

26:45.200 --> 26:47.520
and look what it's brought you instead.

26:47.600 --> 26:52.600
Sure. But the massive headache
really takes the edge off it all.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.800
Are you happy, Sam?

26:56.880 --> 26:58.160
What?

26:58.240 --> 27:01.120
Just answer the question.

27:01.200 --> 27:06.640
Well, at the moment things are a little
rough, but in general, sure, I'm happy.

27:06.720 --> 27:11.440
No, you're not.
You're content. You're satisfied.

27:12.400 --> 27:14.520
You're in control.

27:14.600 --> 27:19.800
- And that's the problem.
- OK. I'm really not following here.

27:19.880 --> 27:24.240
I'm saying you're missing
something vital from your life.

27:24.320 --> 27:26.840
The sad part is you have
no idea what I mean.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.280
Dad, I am happy.

27:30.280 --> 27:33.920
I've seen and done things
most people couldn't even dream of.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.560
- I have an incredible life.
- And yet you're alone.

27:38.640 --> 27:43.480
Well, lately the dating scene's
been a little stale, but...

27:43.560 --> 27:45.680
then again I am marooned on a spaceship.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.040
No. Always.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.280
For as long as she was alive,

27:52.360 --> 27:56.960
your mother showed me a world
beyond just ambition and career.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.280
She gave my life meaning and balance.

28:00.360 --> 28:03.880
It was my honour to love her
for the short time she was with me.

28:03.960 --> 28:07.520
And if I were young again
and I met her for the first time,

28:07.600 --> 28:09.920
even knowing her fate,

28:10.000 --> 28:12.360
I would do it all over again.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.120
That is love.

28:18.680 --> 28:22.720
Sam, I know you've denied yourself
the experience

28:22.800 --> 28:28.680
because you think it must inevitably
end in pain and loneliness.

28:35.120 --> 28:40.840
It's time to let go of the things that
prevent you from finding happiness.

28:40.920 --> 28:44.360
You deserve to love someone...

28:46.000 --> 28:48.040
and be loved in return.

29:14.360 --> 29:15.600
Report, Colonel.

29:15.680 --> 29:20.160
This one was a bust too. These folks
were more in the dark than the first bunch.

29:20.240 --> 29:23.000
They were indeed a primitive society.

29:23.080 --> 29:28.560
Whatever. They hadn't seen any sign
of the ship. We're oh-for-seven on this, sir.

29:28.640 --> 29:30.520
You heard from the Tok'ra?

29:30.600 --> 29:33.520
They've made an initial trace
of the Prometheus's route.

29:33.600 --> 29:37.320
There's no sign of it at any of
the designated cool-down coordinates.

29:37.400 --> 29:40.840
- Assuming they stayed on course.
- They're expanding the search,

29:40.920 --> 29:44.280
conducting long-range scans of systems
adjacent to the route home.

29:44.360 --> 29:48.440
Hopefully, we'll hear
something from them soon.

30:08.120 --> 30:10.120
I don't wanna hear it.

30:13.320 --> 30:15.720
Good. Cos I'm not in the mood.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.320
All right. What?

30:21.400 --> 30:24.560
When Colonel Maybourne and you
were stranded offworld,

30:24.640 --> 30:28.400
Major Carter felt
a similar sense of frustration.

30:28.480 --> 30:32.280
She despaired at the thought
of never seeing you again.

30:33.760 --> 30:36.520
- Not you?
- Indeed.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.920
You are like a brother to me, O'Neill.

30:40.000 --> 30:43.400
You're like, what, 140?

30:43.480 --> 30:47.640
A younger brother perhaps.
But that is not my point.

30:48.640 --> 30:51.920
Look, T, I know what you're trying to do.

30:54.960 --> 30:57.160
And I appreciate it.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.360
Wanna try?

31:14.080 --> 31:16.000
It's fun.

31:18.800 --> 31:23.320
I remember when I was a little girl, I used
to wonder how a bubble could exist.

31:23.400 --> 31:27.320
There's this thing called surface tension.
When molecules bind together...

31:27.400 --> 31:29.080
Boring.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.560
Here, just try.

31:36.240 --> 31:38.320
See? Fun.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.960
Yeah.

31:40.040 --> 31:42.680
All right, Carter. On your feet. Let's go.

31:43.680 --> 31:46.840
I was wondering
when you were gonna show up.

31:46.920 --> 31:50.240
- You just gonna sit there?
- Too tired, sir.

32:01.680 --> 32:04.120
Samantha...

32:04.200 --> 32:08.960
I'm a figment of your imagination.
You're gonna call me "sir"?

32:09.880 --> 32:11.680
Old habit. Sorry.

32:11.760 --> 32:15.200
- Are you gonna save yourself or what?
- I've tried.

32:15.280 --> 32:19.080
- Just giving up, then?
- I don't know what else to do right now.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.920
You'll think of something.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.720
You came to give me a pep talk?

32:24.800 --> 32:27.440
That's what friends are for.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.680
- Friends.
- Hey!

32:29.760 --> 32:33.040
This is you talking here.
Might as well be honest.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.040
What if I quit the air force?

32:37.120 --> 32:41.320
Would that change anything
or is it just an excuse?

32:41.400 --> 32:45.240
- I'd never ask you to give up your career.
- Cos you don't feel anything for me?

32:45.320 --> 32:47.760
- Carter...
- I'd let you go right now if I knew.

32:47.840 --> 32:51.680
- That easy?
- I didn't say it would be easy.

32:51.760 --> 32:54.960
Then what's stopping you,
if you really wanna know?

32:55.040 --> 32:57.040
I'm trying.

32:57.120 --> 32:59.800
Maybe it's not me that's the problem here.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.800
Let's face it, I'm not that complex.

33:04.760 --> 33:07.560
- Me?
- Sam...

33:08.080 --> 33:10.080
I'm a safe bet.

33:12.920 --> 33:17.720
As long as I'm thinking about you, setting
my sights on what I think is unattainable,

33:17.800 --> 33:21.200
there's no chance
of being hurt by someone else.

33:21.280 --> 33:24.400
Jacob was right.

33:24.480 --> 33:26.880
You deserve more.

33:30.480 --> 33:34.680
I will always be there for you,
no matter what.

33:37.280 --> 33:39.280
Believe me.

33:42.960 --> 33:45.240
So what now?

33:45.320 --> 33:47.320
Go save your ass.

33:48.360 --> 33:49.920
One last thing.

34:00.240 --> 34:01.480
Never mind.

34:01.560 --> 34:03.560
(loud creaking)

34:09.159 --> 34:11.159
(alarm)

34:22.440 --> 34:25.679
- What do you want?
- What do you mean?

34:26.440 --> 34:30.480
Whoever you are, I know why everyone
else has shown up. Why are you here?

34:30.560 --> 34:32.440
What do you want from me?

34:33.040 --> 34:36.159
I don't want anything, but you do.

34:36.239 --> 34:40.360
"Then the traveller in the dark
thanks you for your tiny spark."

34:40.440 --> 34:44.920
"How could he see where to go
if you did not twinkle so?"

35:00.960 --> 35:03.760
- What you looking at?
- It's complicated.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.240
Try me.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.480
I'm gonna try to save myself
with a bubble.

35:07.560 --> 35:09.000
How?

35:09.080 --> 35:12.880
The hyperdrive won't fully engage,
but maybe it doesn't have to.

35:12.960 --> 35:17.880
If I can dial down the power flow, I should
cause a partial shift into hyperspace,

35:17.960 --> 35:20.320
taking the ship out of
the cloud's space-time.

35:20.400 --> 35:23.760
Hopefully, enough to cancel
its effects on the sublight engines.

35:23.840 --> 35:26.240
- Neat.
- Yeah.

36:12.520 --> 36:14.720
Sam, what are you doing?

36:17.360 --> 36:20.200
She's attempting to rescue
her fellow crew members.

36:20.280 --> 36:23.440
That's crazy. Get back to Earth
and then bring in the cavalry.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.200
- There's no time.
- I agree.

36:25.280 --> 36:30.680
- The alien vessel is too formidable.
- Will you guys shut up? Just let her work.

36:49.720 --> 36:54.200
This is Major Samantha Carter
of the US Air Force vessel Prometheus.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.760
- Can you hear me?
- (static)

37:00.160 --> 37:03.320
I'm thinking you've been stuck in here
as long as I have.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.160
The only difference is,
I've found a way out.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.000
(static)

37:12.520 --> 37:19.120
Here's the deal. Return my crew -
everyone, intact - and let us go,

37:19.200 --> 37:23.400
and I'll help you get outta here.
Do we have a deal?

37:41.320 --> 37:43.480
What the hell just happened?

37:43.560 --> 37:46.960
It's a long story, sir. Just bear with me.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.920
I'm activating a hyperspace bubble
to include the alien vessel.

37:52.000 --> 37:55.280
- We're gonna bring it out of the cloud.
- Major?

37:56.160 --> 37:59.760
I'll explain everything soon enough, sir.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.800
Now what?

38:13.880 --> 38:17.120
We see if they keep
their end of the bargain.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.400
Well done, Major.

38:32.480 --> 38:35.080
Sir, I'd like to relieve myself of duty now.

38:35.160 --> 38:36.920
Easy.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.080
Get her to the infirmary.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.880
Hey.

39:14.960 --> 39:16.960
Jack?

39:17.840 --> 39:19.840
Excuse me?

39:23.320 --> 39:25.400
Sorry, sir.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.480
Yes, well...

39:28.320 --> 39:33.080
A massive concussion
will tend to disorient one.

39:34.840 --> 39:36.640
How long was I out there?

39:36.720 --> 39:39.560
It's all relative,
that time-space continuum thing.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.280
- Sir.
- Four days.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.000
I could have sworn it was weeks.

39:48.080 --> 39:50.920
Teal'c and Daniel say hi.

39:51.000 --> 39:54.560
They're planning a bit of a shindig
for when you're up and around.

39:54.640 --> 39:57.600
There's talk of cake.

39:57.680 --> 40:00.240
- A cake?
- My idea.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.680
Can't wait.

40:06.760 --> 40:10.360
Need anything? Magazine? Yo-yo?

40:11.640 --> 40:13.720
I'm fine.

40:13.800 --> 40:16.600
Yes, you are.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.680
Thank you, sir.

40:19.640 --> 40:21.640
For what?

40:24.320 --> 40:26.160
Nothing.

40:26.240 --> 40:29.400
Think nothing of it. I've got plenty of that.

40:40.680 --> 40:45.960
(girl) * Twinkle, twinkle, little star

40:46.520 --> 40:52.960
* How I wonder what you are
