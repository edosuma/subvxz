S-o-l-d-i-e-r.

01:25.253 --> 01:28.654
Service to the country, occupation
and career enhancement,

01:28.689 --> 01:30.890
leadership, diversity,

01:30.925 --> 01:33.459
income, excitement and respect.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.595
They're all great reasons
to join the army.

01:35.630 --> 01:37.763
Which would you say
is your number one priority?

01:37.798 --> 01:39.399
- Excitement.
- Occupation.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.968
What are you naturally good at?

01:42.003 --> 01:43.636
I uh, I'm good at fixing cars.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.572
Like the old diesel engines
not the new computerized ones.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.474
I'll tell you what.
You take the Asvab.

01:48.509 --> 01:50.754
We schedule the physical and
then we three will have another

01:50.778 --> 01:52.612
little sit down and seal the deal.
All right?

01:52.647 --> 01:53.847
All right.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.343
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.847
Excuse me.
Your change.

03:49.664 --> 03:51.831
You'd totally get a guy
who'd do it for free.

03:51.866 --> 03:53.366
Yeah, but I didn't
know any better.

03:53.401 --> 03:54.567
I wanted to test it out.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.973
I didn't think
anyone was looking.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.042
Ice cream time, ladies.

04:17.291 --> 04:20.927
So what do I need to do to get
my friend here some ice cream?

04:22.196 --> 04:23.629
I'm all closed up.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.365
Pretty please.

04:33.841 --> 04:34.974
Got some chocolate sauce?

04:43.150 --> 04:44.784
Are you working here
all weekend?

04:45.286 --> 04:46.919
I am.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.454
I bet you could use a beer.

04:51.025 --> 04:52.358
Or two.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.995
There's plenty
of beer at my house.

04:57.331 --> 04:58.664
Rayna!

04:58.699 --> 05:01.634
I'm playing music
with some friends later.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.040
Play music with my friends.

06:24.885 --> 06:27.387
Okay, let's keep
this party going.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.131
Recycle.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.802
You've been cradling
that same beer all night.

06:42.837 --> 06:44.704
I bet you haven't
taken two swigs.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.643
Flat.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.478
Sorry.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.946
Don't be sorry, baby girl.

06:53.981 --> 06:55.848
- Let's catch up.
- -Rayna.

06:55.883 --> 06:56.883
We're taking off.

06:56.918 --> 06:59.351
Oh, I should probably see
if I can get a ride.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.920
They're not going anywhere.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.181
All right.

07:30.217 --> 07:33.252
I pour, you drink.

07:44.031 --> 07:45.731
You don't want
to be rude. Do you?

07:56.443 --> 07:57.643
You like me, huh?

07:59.213 --> 08:00.213
What?

08:25.506 --> 08:27.073
Nailed it.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.075
I knew it.

08:59.073 --> 08:59.972
Mom.

09:00.007 --> 09:01.541
Hannah, Sadie.

09:01.942 --> 09:02.942
Hello.

09:02.977 --> 09:03.977
Hi, gram.

09:05.079 --> 09:06.612
Oh.

09:06.647 --> 09:08.748
You girls want some
Mac and cheese?

09:09.883 --> 09:10.883
Huh?

09:11.352 --> 09:12.585
Mommy.

09:12.620 --> 09:13.863
I said you guys want
some Mac and cheese?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.632
You're gonna break
that horse if you sit there.

09:15.656 --> 09:16.689
All right, Sadie.

09:16.724 --> 09:18.357
Who wants some Mac and cheese?

09:18.392 --> 09:20.170
You want to go ask mommy's friend
if she wants some Mac and cheese?

09:20.194 --> 09:20.993
Who is she?

09:21.028 --> 09:22.761
- What?
- -Who is she?

09:22.796 --> 09:24.697
I don't know.
You've got to ask her.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.231
Hi.

09:26.266 --> 09:27.299
What's your name?

09:27.334 --> 09:28.300
Sadie.

09:28.335 --> 09:29.335
I like that name.

09:29.370 --> 09:30.703
You wanna ask mommy's friend

09:30.738 --> 09:33.072
if she wants some
delicious Mac and cheese?

09:33.107 --> 09:33.839
You want some of this?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.541
- For lunch.
- Want some?

09:35.576 --> 09:37.076
You can stay if you want to.

09:37.111 --> 09:38.111
Um...

09:39.213 --> 09:40.679
I'm, uh...

09:40.714 --> 09:42.148
Half an hour late for work.

09:46.453 --> 09:47.920
Hey, gram!

09:47.955 --> 09:50.522
Could you drop my friend off
on your way home?

09:50.557 --> 09:51.924
All right.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.628
Joey.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.440
This is just between us,
you know that, right?

09:57.464 --> 09:58.664
Okay.

10:01.902 --> 10:02.902
Okay, bye.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.370
Bye.

10:04.405 --> 10:06.472
Girls you wanna say goodbye
to mommy's friend, Joey?

10:06.507 --> 10:08.073
Bye, Joey.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.308
Bye, Joey.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.695
Sorry.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.111
When you finish, you
better call your mom

10:35.135 --> 10:36.736
because she was here
looking for you.

10:37.438 --> 10:38.771
- You hear me?
- Mm-hmm.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.435
Sounds good.

11:09.470 --> 11:11.437
And where were you last night?

11:11.472 --> 11:12.504
At a friend's party.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.472
What friend?

11:13.507 --> 11:15.107
No one you know.

11:15.609 --> 11:16.876
I know everyone.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.278
Can I, uh,

11:19.313 --> 11:20.646
borrow your Van?

11:21.715 --> 11:22.715
What friend?

11:22.750 --> 11:24.483
A girl named Rayna.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.618
Rayna hooks up chicks?

11:26.653 --> 11:27.853
I said I was at her party.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.788
Yeah, but you didn't
come home last night.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.290
She knows you're my sister.

11:31.325 --> 11:32.424
You know her too?

11:32.459 --> 11:34.193
She's trash, Joey.

11:34.228 --> 11:37.196
She's one of those girls
who'll just keep having babies

11:37.231 --> 11:39.264
so she can get
a fatter welfare check.

11:39.299 --> 11:42.534
Seriously, Joey, her husband
is an asshole.

11:42.569 --> 11:43.902
Doesn't even drive a truck.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.405
Well, he doesn't seem to be
around that much anyhow.

11:47.508 --> 11:48.508
Whoops!

11:49.576 --> 11:51.310
Started out this morning so...

11:51.345 --> 11:54.046
Did you check the battery
before you took the starter out?

11:55.182 --> 11:57.149
Your husband's
on the road a lot.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.420
You wanna take a shot?

12:02.689 --> 12:04.056
Yeah, I will.

12:04.091 --> 12:06.592
Can we have two wild turkeys?

12:06.627 --> 12:08.627
Oh, my god.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.763
So you kind of have
the voice of an angel.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.500
Just sweet, beautiful.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.023
So, how long you been playing
with Pete and them?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.407
Uh, like, since
graduation I guess.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.442
Oh.

12:24.812 --> 12:26.112
Which was...

12:27.047 --> 12:28.748
Like a couple of months ago.

12:29.483 --> 12:31.150
Okay.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.818
Baby.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.822
You're getting out of here?

12:37.591 --> 12:39.324
Uh...

12:39.359 --> 12:42.294
I'm not going to scoop ice
cream for the rest of my life.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.030
Oh.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.966
Big muscles, big dreams.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.936
Yeah, my mom says
I'm army material.

12:53.574 --> 12:55.174
That's a good place to meet men.

12:55.776 --> 12:56.675
The army.

12:56.710 --> 12:58.043
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.045
I don't know if I should do it.

13:00.080 --> 13:03.149
My sister is having a baby
and I wanna stick around.

13:03.717 --> 13:05.083
Help her out so...

13:05.118 --> 13:06.896
No, you should get out of
here when you can, soldier.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.053
Yeah, where we going?

13:12.693 --> 13:14.660
I am never leaving.

13:14.695 --> 13:15.695
But...

13:17.631 --> 13:19.398
We're gonna have
a very good time

13:19.433 --> 13:21.167
before you get out of here.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.303
What are we gonna do?

13:24.338 --> 13:25.938
I don't know,
I have a few ideas.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.539
Probably starting with shots.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.241
William, two shots.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.742
A brown stuff.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.258
Oh, my god.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.161
Is that you wearing
a Bon Jovi T-Shirt?

13:50.864 --> 13:52.965
My mom and one of her
Creepo boyfriends

13:53.000 --> 13:55.334
took me to a concert in Jersey,

13:55.369 --> 13:57.936
for the one and only time I've
ever been out of Pennsylvania.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.005
Your mom was cool though.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.207
She was flying, Joey.

14:02.242 --> 14:04.843
Passed out before
the concert even started.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.712
Scumbag fingered me
under the bleachers

14:06.747 --> 14:08.513
while they played
"livin' on a prayer".

14:10.550 --> 14:13.052
Don't look at me like that.
I ain't gonna tell you nothing.

14:21.828 --> 14:22.861
Let me show you.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.140
I went to this rainbow gathering

14:24.164 --> 14:25.931
on the other side
of Pennsylvania.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.067
Trippy amazing.

14:30.404 --> 14:31.404
Ah!

14:32.306 --> 14:34.473
There's the grateful dead
and still,

14:34.508 --> 14:36.108
still going and Jerry Garcia...

14:38.345 --> 14:40.112
We could go on tour.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.881
I bet they've got
a real nice bus.

14:42.916 --> 14:45.317
And we can get fake boyfriends.

14:45.352 --> 14:47.352
So that
no one will be suspicious.

14:47.387 --> 14:49.154
I don't care what people think.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.292
Yeah, right.

14:59.633 --> 15:02.201
There are these girls
at the rainbow gathering...

15:05.939 --> 15:08.874
and they were all
lovey-dovey and shit,

15:08.909 --> 15:11.076
and they shared a tent,

15:11.111 --> 15:14.446
and nobody in their crew

15:15.849 --> 15:17.349
said nothing about it.

15:18.151 --> 15:20.152
Where were they from?

15:20.187 --> 15:22.288
I asked them.
Burlington, Vermont.

15:23.557 --> 15:24.557
Oh.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.094
I took off next Wednesday

15:29.129 --> 15:31.263
to take you to that
army physical.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.302
Okay.

15:39.740 --> 15:41.173
Keep those on,

15:41.208 --> 15:43.008
and try the blouse with them.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.644
Mary's niece, Kelly,
you remember her?

15:46.580 --> 15:47.879
Kind of.

15:47.914 --> 15:49.614
Bonnie's older sister.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.949
She was in the service,

15:50.984 --> 15:52.484
and she went to college,

15:52.519 --> 15:55.787
and now she's teaching fifth
grade over in Tunkhannock.

15:56.857 --> 15:58.890
Mary says she loved the army.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.225
Made lots of friends.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.829
Yeah, um...

16:03.864 --> 16:06.598
I don't know, ma, Chet said
that I could keep my hours

16:06.633 --> 16:07.844
and just start doing cow chores

16:07.868 --> 16:10.202
once the ice cream
season slows down.

16:10.904 --> 16:11.970
Hmm.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.272
And the band's got gigs.

16:17.677 --> 16:18.711
Tuck it in.

16:24.618 --> 16:28.553
I think Pete and Kris are probably
gonna need help with the baby too.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.589
Oh, Kristen's got my help.

16:30.624 --> 16:33.726
You need to start thinking
about your own future, honey.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.128
And I think...

16:36.163 --> 16:40.298
Kristen is fixing to ask you about
turning your room into the baby's room,

16:40.333 --> 16:43.035
so, well, we're gonna
have to figure that out.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.970
Now...

16:45.005 --> 16:47.339
That's a church outfit.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.712
After dinner, could you
give me a ride to Noxen?

16:55.649 --> 16:57.382
Fair season is over, honey.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.184
Why do you need to go out there?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.755
Just visiting a friend.

17:04.991 --> 17:08.560
People make crystal methane
at Noxen.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.130
I saw it on the news.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.665
She's nice, ma.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.069
Pete and Kristen know her.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.316
<i>The law that has been known
as "don't ask, don't tell..."</i>

17:20.339 --> 17:23.608
Please tell me you are not
gonna try and stay around here

17:23.643 --> 17:27.345
and let Pete and Kristen's friends
have a bad influence on you.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.713
It's not gonna be like that.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.750
<i>Sexual orientation,
with our fear of reprisal.</i>

17:39.259 --> 17:41.760
So do you water
the cows every night?

17:41.795 --> 17:43.562
- Yeah.
- Do you milk the cows?

17:43.597 --> 17:44.597
No.

17:45.565 --> 17:46.565
One sec.

18:53.033 --> 18:55.000
- Who the hell is up there?
- Oh, fuck.

18:56.803 --> 19:00.172
I'm gonna perforate that loft with
buckshots in about 30 seconds

19:00.207 --> 19:01.373
if you don't come down.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.709
Oh, hey, Chet, just me.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.547
I was watering the cows and I noticed
they could use a little bit more hay.

19:08.582 --> 19:11.917
Sorry, Chet, I didn't
mean to scare you.

19:11.952 --> 19:14.853
I think it's about time your
boyfriend came down from up there.

19:14.888 --> 19:15.921
There's no one up there.

19:15.956 --> 19:17.022
Hah!

19:17.057 --> 19:18.557
You're looking for me?

19:18.592 --> 19:20.792
Do you think that
you could help me down?

19:20.827 --> 19:23.662
I'm a little bit scared
of rickety old ladders.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.511
Thank you.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.831
Could they make like a
hemp-flavored ice cream?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.200
I think that would be cool.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.303
I got fired.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.505
From the dairy?

20:09.576 --> 20:11.743
What did you do? Gave away
too many free scoops?

20:14.881 --> 20:16.548
No, you, uh...

20:16.583 --> 20:19.451
You dipped the chocolate
with the strawberry scooper?

20:22.122 --> 20:23.122
No.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.025
You got caught doing
the nasty at work?

20:27.060 --> 20:28.293
Not nasty.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.961
You did.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.998
So, like, what? Did you go muff
diving in the back cooler?

20:33.033 --> 20:34.533
Don't be a pig, Pete, come on.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.334
You're a champ.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.503
You're a fucking champ, Joey.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.316
I don't know what your mom's
always talking about,

20:40.340 --> 20:41.806
you not living up
to your potential.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.943
You're like a carpet-munching
superhero.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.012
Hot.

20:47.047 --> 20:48.446
What's that supposed to mean?

20:48.481 --> 20:49.347
What?

20:49.382 --> 20:51.516
That I'm not living up
to my potential?

20:58.692 --> 21:01.593
Why isn't Kristen living
up to her potential?

21:01.628 --> 21:02.838
She's the one who's
about to be a mom.

21:02.862 --> 21:05.497
Yeah, well we're
already lost causes.

21:06.099 --> 21:07.466
You're the hope, sister.

21:09.102 --> 21:10.435
Let's go.

21:16.109 --> 21:17.275
I'm coming in with you.

21:17.310 --> 21:18.943
I don't mind seeing
how Rayna's looking.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.846
- Nope.
- First time I ate my shrimps was with her.

21:21.881 --> 21:22.881
Did you know that?

21:23.650 --> 21:25.817
Hey, Hannah.
Hey, Sadie.

21:25.852 --> 21:26.985
Hi, Joey.

21:41.434 --> 21:44.402
Rayna, I love you
and I want to be with you.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.604
Let's go to Vermont.

21:46.239 --> 21:47.739
Who is it?

21:47.774 --> 21:51.076
It's Joey. Uh, she babysits the
girls and I owe her some money.

21:51.111 --> 21:52.510
Joey, come to the club.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.512
Oh, no, that's okay.
I'll just come back tomorrow.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.848
Well, did you walk?
Where's your car?

21:56.883 --> 21:58.083
It's down the road.

21:58.118 --> 21:59.918
Well, come on in if you're in.

21:59.953 --> 22:02.020
Come, Rayna, let's get
the baby sitter...

22:02.055 --> 22:03.722
What kind of beer do you drink?

22:03.757 --> 22:04.757
Oh, I'm okay.

22:04.791 --> 22:05.924
Get her a beer.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.831
Right.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.400
You look after my girls?

22:16.002 --> 22:17.002
Sometimes.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.371
Let me ask you something, Joey,

22:19.406 --> 22:22.341
since you know I'm not someone who
knows what goes on around here.

22:24.711 --> 22:27.412
Where has she been when you're
doing all this babysitting?

22:29.516 --> 22:31.550
I don't know,
shopping and stuff.

22:34.621 --> 22:36.454
Get the fuck out of here.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.089
- All right.
- Shut up.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.492
This was seriously...

22:40.527 --> 22:42.928
What's your damn business?
What do I owe you?

22:43.930 --> 22:45.931
Uh, thirty bucks.

22:47.167 --> 22:48.367
That much?

22:48.802 --> 22:49.701
I think so.

22:49.736 --> 22:51.536
You want to get my wallet, baby?

22:52.105 --> 22:54.706
Shit. Oh...

23:06.386 --> 23:07.552
Thirty...

23:09.522 --> 23:11.790
All right, service is rendered.

23:11.825 --> 23:13.658
- It's okay, don't worry about it.
- No.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.693
Take it.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.529
I'll call you if I need you.

23:22.335 --> 23:23.635
Give me a hand.

23:42.522 --> 23:43.688
Where is he now?

23:44.557 --> 23:46.091
Passed out on the couch
till morning.

23:47.060 --> 23:48.060
The girls, they're...

23:48.962 --> 23:49.962
In the car.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.132
Jesus, Joey, I'm kidding.
They're with their gram.

23:54.167 --> 23:55.801
- I hate this.
- Joey.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.106
You're not the only one
that feels something.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.742
I don't understand you.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.288
If you fell like having sex
with him so much,

24:06.312 --> 24:07.746
what are you doing with me?

24:08.348 --> 24:09.681
What am I supposed to do?

24:10.416 --> 24:11.550
Leave Roy?

24:13.586 --> 24:15.320
- Yeah.
- And then what? And then what?

24:15.355 --> 24:16.499
- You tell me?
- We can get a place.

24:16.523 --> 24:17.823
You, me, and the girls.

24:25.999 --> 24:28.467
Being with you,
I feel like I'm...

24:29.502 --> 24:31.013
You know, I'm gonna
have to start over.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.136
You are, we can.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.538
No, Joey.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.707
I can't. I can't.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.381
Well, don't worry.

24:43.416 --> 24:46.718
I won't come by again, if that's
what you came here to tell me.

26:04.897 --> 26:06.865
<i>I took the Asvab,
that army test.</i>

26:07.834 --> 26:09.701
Still thinking
of joining the army?

26:11.904 --> 26:14.806
I can't afford
all that by myself.

26:14.841 --> 26:17.175
So you do want to go to
college, you just can't cut it.

26:18.378 --> 26:22.247
Well, let's say I did,
which, I'm not saying I do,

26:23.850 --> 26:25.650
the army will
help me pay for it.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.352
Free.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.622
Yeah, well...

26:30.657 --> 26:32.123
There ain't
nothing for free, Joey.

26:46.372 --> 26:47.772
Here they go.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.947
Hannah, come
get your pumpkin, sweetie.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.549
Hannah, is this what you want?

26:58.584 --> 27:00.462
- What about that one?
- Hannah, come over here.

27:00.486 --> 27:01.486
No?

27:02.488 --> 27:04.555
What about that one over there?

27:04.590 --> 27:06.191
This one, okay.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.929
- Roy?
- Yeah, babe.

27:11.964 --> 27:15.433
Here, I'll pay, you go
and put the girls in the car.

27:15.468 --> 27:16.501
- Yeah?
- All right.

27:16.536 --> 27:19.170
Oh, look at that pumpkin.
I love it.

27:19.872 --> 27:20.872
Okay.

27:26.913 --> 27:29.947
The girls keep asking me
to take 'em to Joey's ice cream.

27:36.322 --> 27:37.422
How much do I owe you?

27:42.061 --> 27:43.328
I've got to give you something.

27:44.230 --> 27:46.097
Otherwise my hubby
will get suspicious.

27:51.971 --> 27:53.238
You working here tomorrow?

27:54.607 --> 27:55.707
Yup.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.008
What time you get off?

27:58.544 --> 28:01.045
Ooh, attitude.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.415
Just run out of places
for you to get me fired from.

28:08.521 --> 28:09.921
Little miss trouble.

28:13.726 --> 28:16.027
I think you like
my kind of trouble.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.898
You ever been to giants' spear?

28:23.636 --> 28:24.936
No, ma'am.

28:26.639 --> 28:28.172
Five.

28:28.207 --> 28:29.407
I get off work at five.

28:32.311 --> 28:33.411
Note taken.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.748
We wanna get out.

28:38.551 --> 28:40.118
We wanna get out.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.220
Joey's pumpkins.

29:00.873 --> 29:04.108
<i>There was this horse,
and it was going blind.</i>

29:04.143 --> 29:06.344
<i>It had this big field
all around him.</i>

29:06.379 --> 29:10.615
<i>But it always just stayed right
close to this other horse.</i>

29:10.650 --> 29:14.519
<i>Turns out the other horse
had a bell around its neck.</i>

29:14.554 --> 29:18.389
<i>And the blind horse followed
this horse wherever it went.</i>

29:18.424 --> 29:19.957
<i>They became almost inseparable.</i>

29:19.992 --> 29:21.860
Just the sound of it was enough.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.404
So what are you
saying, that I'm...

29:34.640 --> 29:37.008
Lost and you're gonna
show me the way?

29:40.680 --> 29:42.313
Or am I the horse with the bell?

29:44.150 --> 29:46.751
I'm just saying
that sometimes...

29:46.786 --> 29:48.686
God brings people
into our lives,

29:48.721 --> 29:51.489
and what we thought was our fate

29:51.524 --> 29:52.924
really isn't anymore.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.269
Whoa!

30:42.141 --> 30:44.008
You really believe
all that hoopla?

30:46.646 --> 30:47.979
What hoopla?

30:48.014 --> 30:49.581
The Bible bangin' hoopla.

30:53.419 --> 30:55.887
You know, all preachers
are perverts, Joey.

31:06.666 --> 31:08.966
You act like the way things
are for you and the girls

31:09.001 --> 31:10.602
is the only way that it can be.

31:12.038 --> 31:13.238
But it's not.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.181
You wanna

31:24.216 --> 31:26.384
make a family
with me and my girls?

31:28.421 --> 31:29.320
Then join the army

31:29.356 --> 31:31.389
and get yourself some
skills and some money.

31:33.893 --> 31:35.026
Forget it.

32:02.521 --> 32:03.554
Sing a song.

32:09.328 --> 32:10.361
Come on.

32:11.464 --> 32:13.130
Sing a song.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.032
Now I know
you don't like gospel.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.434
Oh, I said I didn't like church.

32:16.469 --> 32:18.336
I never said
I didn't like gospel.

32:54.273 --> 32:55.740
Now I'm gonna keep going,

32:55.775 --> 32:57.108
and you're gonna do your thing.

32:59.845 --> 33:01.712
No.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.213
I'm not singing all alone.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.325
- Oh, you're so good.
- Oh, come on.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.061
You are, you know that.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.364
- One more time.
- All right.

34:19.324 --> 34:21.125
Roy lost his job, Joey.

34:25.598 --> 34:28.132
He gets back from
his run tonight and that's it.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.341
Last time he was unemployed, he was
home for four and a half months.

34:45.518 --> 34:49.053
I'm not gonna let you
blow your future,

34:49.088 --> 34:52.824
sticking around here and
making $7.25 an hour,

34:53.826 --> 34:55.426
sneaking around with some...

34:57.229 --> 34:58.863
Married woman from the sticks.

35:00.099 --> 35:01.899
Are you?

35:01.934 --> 35:03.401
- I don't...
- now get in there.

35:04.470 --> 35:06.504
I don't mind
sticking around here.

35:07.940 --> 35:09.440
I don't mind waiting for you.

35:14.380 --> 35:16.214
Pumpkins will be done, Joey.

35:18.317 --> 35:20.217
You're gonna make
your mama real proud

35:20.252 --> 35:21.819
loafing around here in welfare.

35:27.593 --> 35:30.628
Just 'cause I stay here doesn't
mean I have to end up like you.

35:33.933 --> 35:34.933
Nice.

36:08.968 --> 36:09.968
Fuck!

36:39.632 --> 36:42.700
But I'm still gonna be
right here when you get back.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.270
Do this for us, Joey.

37:26.378 --> 37:27.811
Baby's room.

37:27.846 --> 37:29.046
Looks great, kiddo.

37:29.081 --> 37:30.481
I signed up for the army.

37:30.883 --> 37:32.283
You did?

37:32.318 --> 37:34.952
I haven't heard any talk
about the army for weeks.

37:34.987 --> 37:40.491
Three years in, and I kind of
qualified to fix APCs and Rhinos

37:40.526 --> 37:41.926
and all the big stuff.

37:43.128 --> 37:46.363
You signed up tonight?

37:46.398 --> 37:49.767
Yeah, I signed up
tonight or this afternoon.

37:49.802 --> 37:51.780
I have three years of service,
I wanna go to college,

37:51.804 --> 37:54.739
and if I do, the army will help
me pay for a good chunk of it.

37:56.542 --> 38:00.177
Well, put that roller down
and give your mom a hug, honey.

38:00.212 --> 38:03.414
- This is big news.
- I've got wet paint all over me, mom.

38:27.339 --> 38:30.808
Right face, left face.

38:31.844 --> 38:33.711
Present arm.

38:33.746 --> 38:37.348
<i>The diagnostics tool is the most
important tool that you're gonna have.</i>

38:37.383 --> 38:40.584
So, we would like to have each
one of you mechanics in the shop

38:40.619 --> 38:42.886
to come up and use this
diagnostics tool

38:42.921 --> 38:45.289
instead of trying
to just figure out by head.

38:45.324 --> 38:46.824
Hut! Attention.

38:47.326 --> 38:49.259
Right face.

38:49.294 --> 38:51.995
If we have a vacuum leak,
where do we find it?

38:52.030 --> 38:54.264
If you have a vacuum leak,
what you're gonna do is...

38:54.299 --> 38:56.133
<i>Look at the air
in the induction system.</i>

38:56.168 --> 38:57.801
<i>The induction system
that you got.</i>

38:57.836 --> 39:00.304
And Joey, you're doing a good job.
I really appreciate that.

39:00.339 --> 39:01.839
Attention.

39:02.441 --> 39:04.141
Right face.

39:04.176 --> 39:06.310
- One, two, three.
- -One.

39:06.345 --> 39:08.312
- One, two, three.
- -Two.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.547
<i>All soldiers be advised,</i>

39:10.582 --> 39:13.817
<i>bus departs post in 1400 hours.</i>

39:13.852 --> 39:15.119
<i>Final boarding call.</i>

39:43.882 --> 39:45.783
- You've got to pay for it.
- -What?

39:45.818 --> 39:47.685
- I did.
- Did you make the beans?

39:48.420 --> 39:49.787
I opened the can.

39:50.722 --> 39:52.990
That's making beans, right?

39:53.025 --> 39:54.125
That's what the extent is.

39:54.960 --> 39:55.926
Culinary master.

39:55.961 --> 39:57.705
Joey, your mom told me
they've been having you

39:57.729 --> 39:59.663
fixing some tanks
down there in Virginia.

39:59.698 --> 40:00.864
Texas.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.133
Is that what they're gonna
have you do in Iraq?

40:03.168 --> 40:04.501
Afghanistan.

40:04.536 --> 40:07.438
Uh, it's more like fixing
armored covered vehicles.

40:07.473 --> 40:08.839
They're called rhinos.

40:08.874 --> 40:11.575
That right, they're gonna
have you fix rhinos under fire?

40:11.610 --> 40:14.645
Yeah, and I'm gonna be worried
about her night and day.

40:15.848 --> 40:17.514
Pete, I heard
you got yourself a new job.

40:17.549 --> 40:20.217
Uh, actually it was last month,
this month he got a raise.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.351
Anyone wants soda?

40:21.386 --> 40:22.664
Joey, you're gonna be filling in

40:22.688 --> 40:24.432
for that shitty singer
Pete's been playing with?

40:24.456 --> 40:25.556
If he wants me to.

40:25.591 --> 40:27.658
Yeah, of course, she is.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.493
- All right.
- We're practicing tonight.

40:29.528 --> 40:31.128
Tomorrow should probably do.

40:32.331 --> 40:33.997
Tomorrow works.

40:34.032 --> 40:38.001
Oh, finally here. It feels like I've
been waiting for you for hours.

40:38.036 --> 40:40.737
Beard! Since when
did you have that too?

40:40.772 --> 40:42.473
Since I heard you liked it.

40:46.578 --> 40:50.681
Is that enough to buy you
a shot or what?

40:52.684 --> 40:53.684
Can I?

40:56.989 --> 40:58.021
- Here.
- No.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.056
Here's one on the house.

41:00.292 --> 41:02.159
Uh, no.

41:02.194 --> 41:03.194
You like it?

41:05.531 --> 41:07.464
- What?
- Working in there.

41:07.499 --> 41:08.766
Do you like it?

41:11.537 --> 41:14.872
Pays better than Wendy's and I don't
smell like a fryer when I get home.

41:19.645 --> 41:22.880
I don't know.
Looks like you're on display.

41:26.885 --> 41:29.053
That's how I make
my tips, baby girl.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.158
You could serve people drinks

41:35.193 --> 41:36.927
without flashing your boobs.

41:39.097 --> 41:42.833
Don't give me that fucking
possessive husband shit, Joey.

41:45.404 --> 41:46.303
Fuck!

41:46.338 --> 41:47.605
I don't need two of you.

42:12.397 --> 42:13.664
I'm sorry.

42:17.769 --> 42:19.970
I have some fun, Joey.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.841
Just a little fucking fun.

42:25.611 --> 42:27.044
I want to have fun too.

42:59.144 --> 43:01.679
- The girls are sleeping so we have to be quiet, okay?
- Okay.

43:43.055 --> 43:44.221
I love you, Joey.

43:45.257 --> 43:46.357
I love you, Rayna.

44:06.678 --> 44:07.878
Oh, baby.

44:16.588 --> 44:18.155
I wanna run away with you.

44:20.492 --> 44:21.959
I hate life without you.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.295
Come live on the post with me.

44:26.398 --> 44:27.865
Be my army wife.

44:30.769 --> 44:33.137
- In Afghanistan?
- Mm-hmm.

44:34.940 --> 44:39.309
I'm just gonna pretend for
now that you're not leaving.

44:43.014 --> 44:44.014
Me too.

44:55.293 --> 44:57.327
Voila, you have light.

44:57.963 --> 44:59.863
You're chipper these days.

45:00.866 --> 45:02.366
You're not on drugs, are you?

45:02.634 --> 45:03.834
Gram!

45:03.869 --> 45:06.069
Well, your ma didn't
start on all that

45:06.104 --> 45:08.672
till you were already
in grade school.

45:08.707 --> 45:10.107
So I gotta check.

45:11.710 --> 45:13.543
All right, what's the
story with the stove?

45:13.578 --> 45:15.913
Only one of them
burners is working.

45:17.082 --> 45:19.983
If Roy gets you a new stove,
are you gonna keep it clean?

45:20.018 --> 45:22.486
Oh, what do I need
with a new stove?

45:22.521 --> 45:24.554
I'm gonna die this year.

45:24.589 --> 45:28.091
I just want one of them
big burners to work.

45:28.126 --> 45:29.993
You should ask Roy
for a new stove.

45:30.996 --> 45:32.429
Better take it while you can,

45:32.464 --> 45:34.865
'cause who know how long
he's gonna be in the picture.

45:34.900 --> 45:37.034
Don't you start that nonsense.

45:38.203 --> 45:40.838
You've been taking up
with them town boys again?

45:43.008 --> 45:45.008
Don't you want me to be happy?

45:45.043 --> 45:48.011
You're not gonna be happy
when all the kids in school

45:48.046 --> 45:49.880
are beating up on your girls.

45:50.982 --> 45:53.016
They're not babies
no more, Rayna.

46:04.529 --> 46:06.696
This stove is not broken, gram.

46:06.731 --> 46:08.132
You just got to clean it.

46:10.402 --> 46:13.971
You know, your Roy treats be better
than any of my kids ever did.

46:17.075 --> 46:19.009
That's setting
the bar real high.

46:25.784 --> 46:27.984
I'm gonna surprise mom
on Christmas morning

46:28.019 --> 46:30.620
with a fixed up car.

46:30.655 --> 46:33.957
Motor oil, spark plugs,
antifreeze.

46:33.992 --> 46:35.458
I'm gonna have that dog singin'.

46:35.493 --> 46:38.595
That's after you get mine
and Kristen's singin', right?

46:38.630 --> 46:40.063
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

46:40.098 --> 46:42.499
This amazing engine diagnostics
tool that I brought back,

46:42.534 --> 46:45.635
it's worth, like, I don't know, 3000 bucks.
It tells you everything.

46:45.670 --> 46:47.604
They let you to do that?
Just like...

46:47.639 --> 46:49.506
Borrow a $3000 tool?

46:49.541 --> 46:51.074
Well, I mean...

46:51.109 --> 46:52.375
The check-in counter
was closed,

46:52.410 --> 46:53.777
and I wasn't going
to miss my bus.

46:53.812 --> 46:55.278
God forbid!

46:55.313 --> 46:58.315
Not another second without
my beautiful Rayna!

46:58.350 --> 46:59.482
Oh, god!

47:00.619 --> 47:01.852
She's a good person, Pete.

47:01.887 --> 47:03.420
Let me ask you something, Joey.

47:04.222 --> 47:05.054
Yeah?

47:05.090 --> 47:06.690
You think the day
is ever gonna come

47:06.725 --> 47:09.205
when she's gonna leave that husband
and go and be gay with you?

47:09.594 --> 47:11.161
Yeah, I do.

47:11.196 --> 47:13.496
I mean, I support you,
I do. I support you.

47:13.531 --> 47:15.098
It's just, you know, it's...

47:17.969 --> 47:20.170
Shit, this was on sale
last week.

47:20.906 --> 47:23.140
Same... hey, you...

47:24.376 --> 47:26.009
Are you that babysitter

47:26.044 --> 47:28.078
my little girls have been
talking so much about?

47:28.113 --> 47:29.746
The one with the boy name?

47:29.781 --> 47:31.014
Yeah, Joey. Hi.

47:31.049 --> 47:32.582
Hello, hey.

47:32.617 --> 47:37.220
Yeah, she's over heating right
smack in the middle of winter.

47:37.255 --> 47:39.189
You should check the antifreeze.

47:40.091 --> 47:41.091
Hm?

47:41.726 --> 47:43.193
So you fixes cars, huh?

47:43.228 --> 47:45.896
Uh, I fix trucks in the army.

47:45.931 --> 47:48.198
No, in the army?
I was in the army too.

47:48.233 --> 47:49.599
Oh, shit.

47:49.634 --> 47:51.746
You know, Rayna used to write
me the sweetest letters.

47:51.770 --> 47:52.770
It really kept me going.

47:52.804 --> 47:54.104
Hey, Joey.

47:54.139 --> 47:56.473
- Yeah.
- Think we're gonna be late.

47:56.508 --> 48:00.077
Yeah. Um, tell Sadie
and Hannah I said hi.

48:00.478 --> 48:01.478
Yeah.

48:22.968 --> 48:25.435
- Hey.
- There's my girl.

48:25.470 --> 48:26.736
Fifteen minutes, honey.

48:26.771 --> 48:27.771
All right.

48:27.806 --> 48:29.039
Room three is empty,

48:29.074 --> 48:31.308
if you wanna put a little
color in those cheeks.

48:31.343 --> 48:32.476
Hmm, I'm fine.

48:37.782 --> 48:39.382
How can I help you, honey?

48:39.417 --> 48:41.518
You know a better
Mani-pedi special?

48:44.522 --> 48:45.522
Fuck Roy.

48:47.892 --> 48:49.293
Fuck the army.

48:51.763 --> 48:54.064
Let's start over
like you said, Joey.

49:37.776 --> 49:41.811
What's your ma gonna say when you
bring home a bloody carcass?

49:43.815 --> 49:45.281
Uh, hell no.

49:45.316 --> 49:47.684
My mom's already got 500
questions she's dying to ask

49:47.719 --> 49:51.188
without suspicious dead animals who
knocks around in our doorstep.

50:04.436 --> 50:08.071
<i>You could, uh,
dry up some deer jerky.</i>

50:09.240 --> 50:11.441
Eat it on your way to Vermont.

50:11.476 --> 50:14.244
Let's bring it back to your
place and butcher it ourselves.

50:18.616 --> 50:19.616
No.

50:20.251 --> 50:21.585
Roy is coming home.

50:22.987 --> 50:24.388
Roy is always coming home.

50:26.691 --> 50:29.192
Yeah, well, that's the way it
works when you're married, Joey.

50:29.227 --> 50:31.161
That's the way it works
when you're too afraid

50:31.196 --> 50:33.596
of the unknown to change
your life for the better.

50:33.631 --> 50:34.797
I'm sitting here,

50:34.832 --> 50:38.101
telling you I want to change
my life for the better.

50:39.637 --> 50:40.970
I think it's you.

50:41.005 --> 50:42.672
You're the one
who's too afraid now.

50:42.707 --> 50:43.940
It's not legal.

50:43.975 --> 50:45.675
I signed something
that said three years

50:45.710 --> 50:48.512
because you took me to the
recruiting center and told me to.

50:53.518 --> 50:54.518
Rayna!

50:58.389 --> 51:00.790
Rayna, let's wait and do
it right, like you said.

51:00.825 --> 51:03.493
You're fuckin' full of shit, Joey.
You know that?

51:07.465 --> 51:09.032
I don't think you have any plans

51:09.067 --> 51:11.101
of ever really being
with me ever.

51:11.136 --> 51:14.337
I'm just your goddamn
Christmas vacation.

51:14.372 --> 51:16.473
So let's just leave it at that.

51:16.508 --> 51:18.119
You better hurry up
if you want a ride home.

51:18.143 --> 51:20.110
I'm taking this deer
to gram's house.

51:51.910 --> 51:53.510
When you headed out, Roy?

51:58.783 --> 52:00.183
You used to like it.

52:30.315 --> 52:31.915
Excuse me, how much is this?

52:33.718 --> 52:35.519
You were in the salon
the other day.

52:37.188 --> 52:39.923
Oh, uh, yeah.

52:39.958 --> 52:41.357
My mom works there.

52:41.392 --> 52:43.126
Well, that's cute,

52:43.161 --> 52:44.627
hanging at the mall
with your mom.

52:45.930 --> 52:49.165
Well, I'm only back for a
few days, I'm in the army.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.700
Shouldn't think
that's hot but I do.

52:52.003 --> 52:53.970
Men in uniform.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.472
Got to do what I got to do.

52:56.674 --> 52:57.674
I'm Haley.

52:58.509 --> 52:59.909
I'm Joey.

52:59.944 --> 53:01.311
That's your given name?

53:02.447 --> 53:03.447
Joanna.

53:08.753 --> 53:11.888
Ew, Haley picked
her up at the mall.

53:11.923 --> 53:13.290
Joey, you're in the army?

53:14.292 --> 53:15.759
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

53:16.995 --> 53:18.428
Yeah, you guys, um...

53:18.463 --> 53:20.029
You all go to college?

53:20.064 --> 53:22.799
Oberlin, Wesley, and Smith.

53:24.702 --> 53:26.803
So, um, post
"don't ask, don't tell,"

53:26.838 --> 53:28.338
is it the dawn of a new era,

53:28.373 --> 53:30.740
or an even more precarious
situation for lesbians?

53:30.775 --> 53:33.443
- Well...
- I'm sure it's the same fuckin' shit.

53:33.478 --> 53:36.679
Women's sexual harassment
complaints are rarely pursued,

53:36.714 --> 53:39.882
while charges of homosexuality
made by the same men

53:39.917 --> 53:41.784
are almost always investigated.

53:41.819 --> 53:43.019
Wait. What?

53:43.054 --> 53:45.222
Hello, can Joey answer
my question please?

53:46.524 --> 53:49.459
I mean, yeah, the army
is just like regular life.

53:49.494 --> 53:51.861
Some people are cool.
Some people are assholes.

53:57.935 --> 53:58.969
So what are you into?

54:00.004 --> 54:01.471
Girls, clearly.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.374
I think the term "girl"

54:04.409 --> 54:06.276
is really derogatory,

54:06.311 --> 54:09.045
unless you literally mean
underage young women,

54:09.080 --> 54:11.581
in which case you should
probably keep that to yourself.

54:11.616 --> 54:13.583
Oh, that's not what I meant.

54:14.252 --> 54:15.952
It's cool. I like you.

54:16.821 --> 54:18.555
Yeah, you don't know me.

54:22.360 --> 54:23.893
So tell me something.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.328
Like what?

54:25.363 --> 54:26.696
Are you out to your family?

54:27.765 --> 54:29.766
Kinda. Are you?

54:30.268 --> 54:31.334
Really?

54:34.706 --> 54:36.940
If you were rich would you
still be in the army?

54:37.975 --> 54:38.975
Doubt it.

54:39.644 --> 54:41.378
I do look good in Camo though.

54:43.281 --> 54:45.982
Have you ever been
with a woman before?

54:46.617 --> 54:47.950
Are we gonna do this or what?

54:47.985 --> 54:50.453
- Have you ever been with a woman?
- Yes, have you?

54:51.656 --> 54:52.656
Yeah.

54:53.291 --> 54:54.357
How many?

54:55.259 --> 54:56.292
Three.

54:56.327 --> 54:58.027
And a trans man.

54:58.062 --> 54:59.262
Your twenty questions are up.

54:59.297 --> 55:02.098
- That was five.
- All right.

55:02.133 --> 55:05.702
For every five questions, I get to
take off a piece of your clothing.

55:36.167 --> 55:37.434
Hey, Joey.

55:37.802 --> 55:38.802
Yeah.

55:39.137 --> 55:40.503
Do you like toys?

55:43.574 --> 55:45.442
Put on these boots,
private Gibbons.

55:50.281 --> 55:51.448
And this.

56:22.914 --> 56:24.881
- Hey, girls.
- -Uh-huh.

56:25.983 --> 56:28.117
Silly grandma forgot
to leave the lights on.

56:28.152 --> 56:30.753
So Hannah, I just want you
to stay in the car, okay?

56:30.788 --> 56:32.389
Gram?

56:33.658 --> 56:34.658
Gram?

56:45.536 --> 56:49.772
Rayna is so skanky, Joey.

56:49.807 --> 56:53.676
Her littlest one was downstairs
picking gum drops one by one

56:53.711 --> 56:55.745
off my gingerbread house

56:55.780 --> 56:58.748
with her snot-covered fingers,
and Rayna...

56:59.250 --> 57:00.516
Just stood there.

57:00.551 --> 57:02.485
Wait, Rayna's here?

57:02.520 --> 57:04.954
Came and went. I told
her you were sleeping.

57:04.989 --> 57:08.658
She's crazy, Joey.

57:08.693 --> 57:12.729
Kept going on and on
about her dead gram.

57:13.898 --> 57:14.964
What time is it?

57:14.999 --> 57:18.100
5:30. You've been
sleeping all day.

57:18.135 --> 57:21.004
Everybody knows you're leaving soon.
They want to say bye.

57:27.111 --> 57:29.012
Then my mom's gonna come back.

57:30.014 --> 57:31.781
I give her one week

57:31.816 --> 57:35.518
until she turns this
house into a meth lab.

57:51.435 --> 57:52.869
I'm gonna pack up,
me and the girls,

57:52.904 --> 57:55.572
and I'm gonna be long on the
road before Roy gets back.

57:56.374 --> 57:57.807
What about the funeral?

57:57.842 --> 57:59.720
I don't need some drunk-ass
preacher to stand in the field

57:59.744 --> 58:01.644
and tell me that gram
was a good person.

58:03.848 --> 58:04.848
What about Roy?

58:05.483 --> 58:08.051
Roy is on to us, Joey.

58:30.875 --> 58:32.175
I'm coming with you.

58:40.284 --> 58:41.284
No.

58:44.155 --> 58:45.922
I can't make you a criminal.

58:47.725 --> 58:50.560
I'm just gonna make it through
while you finish your service.

58:54.765 --> 58:56.065
I'm coming with you.

59:08.045 --> 59:10.813
How much money
you got saved up by now?

59:10.848 --> 59:12.582
Uh, about 1000 bucks,

59:12.617 --> 59:14.383
but it's in a savings account.

59:14.418 --> 59:17.486
Do you think your ma's planning
to give you money tomorrow?

59:17.521 --> 59:19.022
We're not gonna
be here tomorrow.

59:31.268 --> 59:34.337
Hi, I'm looking for my mom.
Her name is Ruthie.

59:34.372 --> 59:35.838
I think she's working here.

59:35.873 --> 59:38.641
- I think she's in the kitchen.
- Okay, cool. Thanks.

59:43.080 --> 59:44.847
Hey, mom.

59:44.882 --> 59:46.916
- Mom.
- Is everything okay?

59:46.951 --> 59:50.319
I was just wondering will you
give me money for Christmas?

59:50.354 --> 59:52.588
What has gotten
into you, Joanne?

59:52.623 --> 59:54.290
I'm working.

59:54.325 --> 59:57.493
It's just that if you were gonna
give me money for Christmas,

59:57.528 --> 59:59.028
it would be great
to have it now,

59:59.063 --> 01:00:00.730
because I could
use it for gifts.

01:00:00.765 --> 01:00:03.232
Hun, you've come with me
to the mall how many times

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:06.736
and now you're buying Christmas
presents on Christmas Eve?

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:09.105
Rayna put you up to this?

01:00:10.408 --> 01:00:11.874
No.

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:14.711
That Rayna is married, Joanna.

01:00:16.914 --> 01:00:18.047
Mary sue.

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:20.783
You've met my youngest, Joanna?

01:00:20.818 --> 01:00:22.018
Nice to meet you.

01:00:22.053 --> 01:00:22.885
Likewise.

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:25.054
Your mom's so very proud of you.

01:00:28.325 --> 01:00:31.427
Where are you gonna buy
presents on Christmas Eve?

01:00:31.462 --> 01:00:33.029
Walmart.

01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:34.797
You're coming to midnight mass?

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:39.301
I got a gift card for you
in your stocking.

01:00:39.336 --> 01:00:41.937
Go ahead and take it out
tonight if you need to.

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:43.973
But don't be whining
tomorrow morning

01:00:44.008 --> 01:00:46.442
that there's more in your
sister's stocking than yours.

01:00:46.477 --> 01:00:47.944
I could use some cash too, ma.

01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:52.982
Jesus works in mysterious ways.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.151
The army is sending you overseas

01:00:55.186 --> 01:00:58.321
'cause that Rayna
is a bad influence, honey.

01:00:59.523 --> 01:01:01.691
Those ready, Ruthie?

01:01:01.726 --> 01:01:03.159
Coming right up.

01:01:03.194 --> 01:01:05.127
The natives
are getting restless.

01:01:05.162 --> 01:01:08.865
Okay. You can get plenty of presents
with that Walmart card, honey.

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:15.504
Um, I need to get something
from my mom's coat.

01:01:15.539 --> 01:01:18.674
She said that
it was somewhere...

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.309
The first bedroom on the left.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:44.767
Oh, my gosh, really?

01:01:50.674 --> 01:01:52.174
All coins,

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:53.275
and, hundred bucks,

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:56.979
and there's a Walmart gift card
in my stocking.

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:58.815
You should ask Pete
for money too.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:02.651
You should ask,
he thinks you're hot.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:05.221
Mm, once upon a time,
he was hot too.

01:02:06.023 --> 01:02:07.723
But he's got a small cock.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:09.425
You fucked
my brother-in-law?

01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:12.261
Oh, come on!
That was like 15 years ago.

01:02:12.296 --> 01:02:14.296
No wonder my sister
thinks you're skanky.

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:16.032
Yeah, well,
she went back for more.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.701
I'm gonna go fill up,

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:20.669
and I'll be right back.

01:02:22.273 --> 01:02:24.507
Just give Hannah the ball
if she wants to try it.

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:27.210
I need gas money.

01:02:31.315 --> 01:02:32.315
Bring back change.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:35.952
Joey?

01:02:41.692 --> 01:02:43.126
It's you I wanna be with.

01:02:44.295 --> 01:02:45.995
Not Roy, not Pete.

01:02:46.831 --> 01:02:49.498
Not nobody but you and my girls.

01:02:49.533 --> 01:02:53.202
It never even crossed my mind to
start a new life until I met you.

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:55.337
And you came along,

01:02:55.372 --> 01:02:57.239
little miss big dreams.

01:02:58.676 --> 01:03:00.910
All right, quit dilly-dallying.
Let's hit the road.

01:03:02.046 --> 01:03:03.412
Before I get cold feet.

01:03:04.148 --> 01:03:05.181
Hey, moneybags.

01:03:05.216 --> 01:03:06.282
Well, moneybags.

01:03:06.317 --> 01:03:08.317
So that's what happens
when you get a raise, huh?

01:03:08.719 --> 01:03:09.685
Uh, yeah.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.086
Um...

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:14.323
I was wondering, if I could
maybe borrow a little cash.

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:15.891
How much are we talking?

01:03:15.926 --> 01:03:18.394
Like... 200 bucks.

01:03:18.429 --> 01:03:19.495
200 bucks?

01:03:20.598 --> 01:03:22.064
Rayna put you up to this?

01:03:22.099 --> 01:03:23.199
Mm-mm.

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.408
- You're not gonna go do anything stupid, are you?
- No.

01:03:33.444 --> 01:03:35.110
Give you a hundred bucks.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.214
Do not tell your sister.

01:03:38.249 --> 01:03:40.182
Okay. Thank you.

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:42.985
Let me ask you something, Joey.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.888
What is it that you don't
like about guys, huh?

01:03:45.923 --> 01:03:49.191
I mean how do you know you don't
like cock if you've never tried it?

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.795
I was just telling
your sister here

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:55.364
how she's way too pretty
to be a lesbian.

01:03:55.399 --> 01:03:58.334
Come on, Joey, don't go
off being mad at me.

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:18.054
Where were you?

01:04:18.088 --> 01:04:19.922
Making us some money.

01:04:19.957 --> 01:04:23.826
Sold gram's painkillers
for $147.

01:04:23.861 --> 01:04:24.994
I got a hundred out of Pete.

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:26.896
Oh, yeah, and also...
a hundred?

01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:28.797
Damn. I should have asked him.

01:04:30.534 --> 01:04:32.201
Let's hit the road!

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:34.036
You girls ready
for an adventure?

01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:35.538
I am, you know.

01:04:45.282 --> 01:04:46.982
When are we going home?

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:51.654
Do you girls like Joey?

01:04:52.823 --> 01:04:53.823
Oh, yeah.

01:04:53.857 --> 01:04:55.391
I do, too.

01:04:55.426 --> 01:04:57.894
When are we gonna see grandma?

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:11.907
Are they gonna give me
four stamps in Vermont?

01:05:11.942 --> 01:05:12.975
You're not gonna leave.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:14.321
They have school and
I gotta work.

01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:17.012
How are you gonna work
if you're running from the man?

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:19.448
Could do a lot of things.
Just under the table.

01:05:23.721 --> 01:05:25.688
I'm scared.

01:05:25.723 --> 01:05:27.556
Don't be.
We're almost there.

01:06:07.865 --> 01:06:09.131
Okay, thank you.

01:06:09.533 --> 01:06:10.533
Thanks, we will.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:15.671
What?

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:18.640
It's like a freaking
rainbow gathering in there.

01:06:18.675 --> 01:06:20.976
Everybody is so nice here.

01:06:21.011 --> 01:06:22.578
We got invited
to a party already.

01:06:22.613 --> 01:06:25.748
- No way!
- Yeah, I think so. What's a potluck?

01:06:47.204 --> 01:06:49.171
- So you're new to town?
- Yeah.

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:50.283
You need a place
to stay tonight?

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:52.274
We do. We need
a place. Period.

01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:55.544
Some rooms are opening up
at our house nearby in Johnson.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:57.679
It's kid-friendly,
but you got to be into pets.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:58.947
- She loves pets.
- Yeah.

01:06:58.982 --> 01:07:00.416
I have so many pets.

01:07:00.451 --> 01:07:03.619
I mean I don't have any pets,
whatever is good for the place.

01:07:03.654 --> 01:07:04.820
How much is it?

01:07:04.855 --> 01:07:06.488
Only $700 a month.

01:07:06.523 --> 01:07:08.190
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah?

01:07:08.225 --> 01:07:09.825
- Yeah, we could do that, right?
- -Yeah?

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.529
Can we do that?
Can we do that?

01:07:13.564 --> 01:07:14.564
Can we do that?

01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.837
That's cheap.

01:07:21.872 --> 01:07:26.675
That's... that's Joey's,
that's Joey's stage name.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:28.177
Ms. cheap.

01:07:30.214 --> 01:07:31.658
All right, wonder if we're
gonna have the money

01:07:31.682 --> 01:07:33.693
to get the girls' their bunk
beds after we pay rent.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:35.918
Yeah and they'll be fighting
over who sleeps on top.

01:07:35.953 --> 01:07:37.686
They're gonna be so excited.

01:07:39.022 --> 01:07:40.589
Hannah, look after your sister.

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:43.292
It's not working.

01:07:43.327 --> 01:07:44.426
Why isn't it working?

01:07:47.865 --> 01:07:49.598
You think your mom told them?

01:07:49.633 --> 01:07:51.578
I don't know, I'm not even due back
to the base until tomorrow morning.

01:07:51.602 --> 01:07:52.668
What are we gonna do?

01:07:52.703 --> 01:07:54.136
Thank god I sold that tool.

01:07:54.938 --> 01:07:56.638
Okay, we're just gonna...

01:07:56.673 --> 01:07:59.708
Put the deposit down and we'll lay
low and we'll figure out a plan.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:02.411
What do you mean, you sold that tool?
What tool?

01:08:02.446 --> 01:08:04.480
The computer fixing thingy tool.

01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:06.382
I pawned it when
I sold gram's pills.

01:08:07.651 --> 01:08:08.584
We got 600 bucks for it.

01:08:08.619 --> 01:08:10.586
It's a stolen property
of the us army.

01:08:12.322 --> 01:08:13.722
We got to get out of here.

01:08:15.325 --> 01:08:16.457
What are you gonna do?

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:18.760
We are gonna cross
the border, that's what.

01:08:18.795 --> 01:08:20.429
Come on, girls. Girls?

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:34.743
- Hello, sir, hey.
- Happy holidays

01:08:34.778 --> 01:08:35.911
passports, please.

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:38.113
Uh, I got my military ID.

01:08:41.118 --> 01:08:42.417
I need passports.

01:08:44.488 --> 01:08:46.321
Well, we didn't think
that you needed those.

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:47.790
Since 2001, ma'am.

01:08:48.825 --> 01:08:49.892
Whose children are those?

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.127
They're mine.

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:54.563
You have a driver's license?

01:09:01.205 --> 01:09:02.805
There's a line
behind you, ma'am.

01:09:06.109 --> 01:09:07.408
Shit!

01:09:13.617 --> 01:09:14.850
Don't be nervous.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.990
Nobody's wanted
for anything. That's good.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.959
All right.

01:09:23.993 --> 01:09:27.696
Your military ID is okay, but I can't let
you or the kids through without passports.

01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.666
Okay, well, how do we get those?

01:09:30.701 --> 01:09:31.867
Not my job, ma'am.

01:09:31.902 --> 01:09:35.337
Pull up here, turn around,
head back towards the states.

01:09:35.372 --> 01:09:37.706
- What now?
- -I don't know.

01:09:37.741 --> 01:09:38.607
Be careful.

01:09:38.642 --> 01:09:39.942
- Okay.
- -Thank you.

01:09:56.627 --> 01:10:00.028
Everyone had nap time
except Joey.

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:01.496
I'm good.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:03.599
Quit your pouting and lay down.

01:10:28.025 --> 01:10:29.458
How did you know
I had that tool?

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:37.766
What?

01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:39.835
I didn't tell anyone
about it except Pete.

01:10:44.308 --> 01:10:45.674
You told Roy.

01:10:46.777 --> 01:10:48.677
That day that you
met him downtown.

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:51.981
I did?

01:10:53.684 --> 01:10:54.684
Uh-huh.

01:11:25.315 --> 01:11:28.484
Okay, okay, I got to go.

01:11:29.152 --> 01:11:30.452
Who are you talking to?

01:11:32.989 --> 01:11:34.056
My uncle Gary.

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:39.995
He's making all
the funeral arrangements.

01:11:54.277 --> 01:11:56.011
Let's go for omelets
in the morning.

01:11:56.046 --> 01:11:57.079
Anything you want.

01:12:37.053 --> 01:12:38.286
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Mom?

01:12:38.321 --> 01:12:41.323
<i>Oh, thank the lord, Joanna.
Where are you?</i>

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:42.691
<i>I'm coming to pick you up.</i>

01:12:42.726 --> 01:12:45.193
No, no, no, I'm okay, I'm...

01:12:45.228 --> 01:12:48.997
I'm with Rayna right now and she
really needs me 'cause her gram died.

01:12:49.032 --> 01:12:52.868
<i>Bring her here with them kids
if you have to, honey.</i>

01:12:52.903 --> 01:12:57.873
<i>And what is that platoon
sergeant talking about, Joanna?</i>

01:12:57.908 --> 01:12:59.241
<i>Stolen goods?</i>

01:12:59.276 --> 01:13:03.678
<i>I wrote it down
he called it a... 15-6.</i>

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:05.747
I told him it's all a mistake.

01:13:05.782 --> 01:13:08.450
<i>Told him I was home
all day Christmas</i>

01:13:08.485 --> 01:13:11.019
<i>so that I could
take you to the bus myself.</i>

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:13.221
<i>And you must have
mixed up your days.</i>

01:13:13.256 --> 01:13:15.190
Mom, I love you.

01:13:15.225 --> 01:13:16.925
I'm really,
really sorry. Okay?

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:19.194
I'll call you soon.

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:22.598
<i>Spend some time with your ma this
afternoon before you ship off.</i>

01:13:25.469 --> 01:13:26.735
I love you, mom.

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.938
<i>God bless that Rayna
but she is not...</i>

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:32.240
- Sadie?
- -Daddy, look at it.

01:13:33.677 --> 01:13:37.379
She did.
Daddy, do they have chocolate milk?

01:13:37.414 --> 01:13:39.181
Excuse me, ma'am.
Middle of a call.

01:13:39.216 --> 01:13:41.116
Excuse me, Princess.

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:44.186
Do you have any chocolate
cows in this establishment?

01:13:44.788 --> 01:13:46.721
Daddy!

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:48.991
Lot of flexibility
here really like that.

01:13:51.361 --> 01:13:54.095
Oh, wow.
When I move my foot around...

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:56.965
Roy, you remember Joanna.

01:14:00.203 --> 01:14:04.339
Awfully nice of you to drive my family
all the way up here to see me like this.

01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:08.443
Bastards sent me driving all the
way from Florida to New York state

01:14:08.478 --> 01:14:09.945
on Christmas day.

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:15.383
And when Rayna
called me last night

01:14:15.418 --> 01:14:17.553
to tell me about
gram's funeral, well...

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:21.323
Sometimes you just
got to risk the job

01:14:21.358 --> 01:14:22.825
to take care of your family.

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:28.630
I told Roy that, uh,
you should, uh...

01:14:30.267 --> 01:14:31.567
Take my truck,

01:14:32.569 --> 01:14:35.837
and, uh... have a little

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:37.806
peace and quiet
on your ride home.

01:14:39.509 --> 01:14:41.243
And we're gonna
jump in with him.

01:14:42.212 --> 01:14:43.578
Rayna.

01:14:43.613 --> 01:14:45.647
Joey's about
to leave, girls, uh...

01:14:45.682 --> 01:14:48.316
So, you wanna give her a hug?

01:14:49.553 --> 01:14:51.419
No.

01:14:51.454 --> 01:14:54.055
Sweetie, please
go give Joey a hug.

01:14:54.090 --> 01:14:55.090
No.

01:14:56.493 --> 01:14:57.559
Rayna.

01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:02.831
Get going.

01:15:05.135 --> 01:15:06.135
Drive safe.

01:16:10.533 --> 01:16:13.735
Excuse me.
Excuse me!

01:16:15.739 --> 01:16:17.205
Passport, please.

01:21:29.652 --> 01:21:32.220
<i>Ah, now.</i>

01:21:32.255 --> 01:21:34.656
<i>I keep going, you do your thing.</i>

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:38.994
<i>- No.
- I'm not singing alone.</i>

01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:46.768
<i>Come on.</i>

01:21:52.275 --> 01:21:54.175
<i>Now there up top one more time.</i>

01:21:54.210 --> 01:21:55.643
<i>Come on.</i>

01:22:01.951 --> 01:22:03.118
<i>Wow.</i>

01:22:04.305 --> 01:22:10.829
