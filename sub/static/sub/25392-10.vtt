00:19.950 --> 00:20.950
Yo, Luke!

00:21.750 --> 00:23.960
Yo! Bushmaster whooped your ass again,
didn't he?

00:24.040 --> 00:25.620
It was the other way around, my man.

00:25.710 --> 00:27.590
Oh. Then where's the video of that shit?

00:27.670 --> 00:29.350
You still the Hero of Harlem, right?

00:29.380 --> 00:32.420
My cousin's getting smacked around
by the cops 'cause he has dreads.

00:32.509 --> 00:34.680
Every Jamaican ain't down with Bushmaster.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.800
Hey, hey. You need to handle this, Luke.

00:36.890 --> 00:39.100
My little sister
can't even sleep at night.

00:39.180 --> 00:40.680
What are you gonna do?

00:40.770 --> 00:43.270
Yo, I'm doing the best I can. Okay?

00:43.350 --> 00:47.020
Look, I'm sorry about your bredren.

00:47.900 --> 00:50.270
And I'mma handle Bushmaster. A'ight?

00:50.360 --> 00:53.570
And young lady, I promise,
I'm gonna put a stop to all of this.

00:53.650 --> 00:54.650
No, you ain't.

00:54.740 --> 00:57.070
You ain't no better than the damn cops.

00:57.160 --> 01:00.200
Ooh, damn. She got you.
That's some cold shit.

01:00.280 --> 01:01.290
Let's go.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.870
Man. See, you ain't
using your powers right.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.370
Excuse me?

01:06.460 --> 01:08.960
If I was bulletproof and strong,
I'd be running shit.

01:09.040 --> 01:12.130
I'd be like, "Either you bend a knee,
or you lay down, bitch."

01:12.210 --> 01:16.180
And if they didn't? Dracarys!
Like straight flames for them niggas.

01:16.260 --> 01:19.930
State Property and Game of Thrones
do not mix.

01:20.010 --> 01:22.520
Nah, when you high,
that shit sounds right.

01:25.640 --> 01:26.770
Man, you coming in?

01:26.850 --> 01:29.190
Thought you'd never ask.

01:30.940 --> 01:33.980
No one from Rand will comment
on why the skirmish happened,

01:34.070 --> 01:38.780
if anything was stolen, or what
Luke Cage's rumored involvement was.

01:38.860 --> 01:42.830
The police continue to search for McIver,
also known as Bushmaster,

01:42.910 --> 01:45.410
who escaped police custody three days ago

01:45.500 --> 01:49.420
after setting off an explosive device
inside a police armored van.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.090
Three officers were
severely injured in the blast,

01:53.170 --> 01:55.210
but McIver's body was never recovered.

01:57.130 --> 01:58.220
You see this?

01:58.300 --> 02:01.510
"Sweet Christmas." Money green.

02:02.510 --> 02:03.510
Huh?

02:03.600 --> 02:07.730
"Sweet sister." For the ladies. And...

02:08.350 --> 02:11.650
Power Man yellow. That's where it's at.

02:11.730 --> 02:15.360
All of these would be sold out
if Harlem hadn't turned on you.

02:15.440 --> 02:17.700
Yeah, like you ain't a part of that.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.610
That ambush out there
was your fault, D-Dub.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.950
Everything went downhill
after you sold that video to ESPN.

02:23.030 --> 02:25.740
That was all you. You're the one
talking about, "Step to me,"

02:25.830 --> 02:27.580
throwing tires 30 feet
and hitting the dab.

02:27.660 --> 02:29.670
And you go out there
to capture it all, right?

02:29.750 --> 02:33.420
Look, that's my job.
I catch you as you are.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.170
If your friends can't show you
the truth about yourself,

02:36.260 --> 02:37.760
what good are they?

02:37.840 --> 02:40.590
Bushmaster
got in your head, didn't he, boy?

02:40.680 --> 02:43.760
I whooped his ass, D.W. I broke him down.

02:43.850 --> 02:45.140
And he's still a ghost.

02:45.850 --> 02:47.180
Well, shit happens.

02:47.270 --> 02:49.020
Yeah, especially to me.

02:49.100 --> 02:50.100
I feel like a fireman.

02:50.190 --> 02:51.980
Always putting out fires.
Never enough water.

02:52.060 --> 02:54.190
You're a black man
trying to make a difference.

02:54.270 --> 02:57.780
No black man has ever stepped forward
in service without sacrifice.

02:58.610 --> 03:01.160
You know what? That was halfway deep.

03:02.660 --> 03:05.160
No way. Is that the Luke Cage?

03:06.910 --> 03:09.620
My boy, Danny Rand.

03:09.710 --> 03:11.870
What's up, man? You got time for a selfie?

03:11.960 --> 03:13.380
Whatever, man.

03:13.460 --> 03:16.630
Oh, snap!
Mr. Rand, let me hold your dollar.

03:18.550 --> 03:22.760
No, no, no. I'm playing.
I'm playing. But really, though...

03:22.840 --> 03:24.510
Misty tell you where I was?

03:24.600 --> 03:27.220
Oh, look, man,
I'm so sorry about the office.

03:27.310 --> 03:31.560
Oh, seriously, don't worry about it.
It's not even mine anymore.

03:31.640 --> 03:36.150
I mean, it is, but I'm not running
the day-to-day, so it's fine.

03:36.230 --> 03:37.650
So how'd you find me?

03:38.900 --> 03:40.400
Harlem's Hero app.

03:40.490 --> 03:43.490
I told you
to copyright that shit.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.950
- Tsk.
- Yeah, so you really work out of here?

03:46.530 --> 03:47.790
This place is cool.

03:48.830 --> 03:50.500
Yeah. Thanks.

03:50.580 --> 03:53.040
I'm glad you approve of my lair.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.880
So what's up, Danny? What's good?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Bushmaster.

03:57.960 --> 04:01.550
Yeah. That's my fight, not yours.

04:01.630 --> 04:04.430
When someone comes after my friends,
I make it my fight.

04:04.510 --> 04:07.760
"I make it my fight."
This white boy got swagger, yo.

04:07.850 --> 04:09.270
He's got to.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.850
He calls himself the Immortal Iron Fist.

04:11.930 --> 04:15.310
Yo, that's hot! This cat understands
the power of a brand.

04:15.400 --> 04:19.779
See? Finally somebody gets it.
What's your name?

04:19.860 --> 04:22.110
D.W. Friends call me D-Dub.

04:22.190 --> 04:26.120
See, I became the Fist
when I defeated Shou-Lao. It's a dragon.

04:26.200 --> 04:29.540
Wait! Time out. You fought Bruce Lee?

04:29.620 --> 04:32.160
- You don't look that old.
- No, not Bruce Lee, a real...

04:32.250 --> 04:36.130
I really appreciate you coming by, Danny,
but I'm good. Really.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.670
No, you're not.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.210
You read minds, too?

04:39.300 --> 04:41.760
D.W., seriously, shut up.

04:42.550 --> 04:49.180
Look, Harlem is a part of the city, right?
And we agreed to defend Manhattan.

04:49.260 --> 04:54.350
No. Harlem is Harlem. This ain't Shaolin.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.600
K'un-Lun.

04:59.230 --> 05:00.870
You're not gonna leave me alone, are you?

05:01.860 --> 05:02.860
No.

05:04.860 --> 05:08.950
Whatever, man.
If you stay, you play by my rules.

05:10.160 --> 05:13.410
Come on, man. You know me.
I love a good fight.

05:13.500 --> 05:17.370
"Power Man and Iron Fist."
That's got a ring to it.

05:17.460 --> 05:19.750
That's going on a T-shirt for real.

05:22.840 --> 05:25.340
What do you say? You in?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.940
Nandi, where are you?

07:17.040 --> 07:20.120
Somebody needs to clean up
all this voodoo shit.

07:26.130 --> 07:28.380
This is your fault
it happened in the first place.

07:28.460 --> 07:32.930
That's why I called you.
I'm here to rectify the situation.

07:33.010 --> 07:36.890
You are here because you got
gypped by a Rasta nig.

07:36.970 --> 07:40.060
I'm here because
it's the right thing to do.

07:40.140 --> 07:43.980
All of your holdings,
Harlem's Paradise, your cash,

07:44.060 --> 07:45.650
everything has been restored.

07:48.190 --> 07:49.360
Check your phone.

07:51.400 --> 07:52.400
It's real.

08:01.120 --> 08:02.500
How?

08:02.580 --> 08:06.080
One cannot sign a contract
under extreme duress.

08:08.630 --> 08:09.800
That's ironic.

08:10.840 --> 08:15.390
It's been documented that Mr. McIver
tortured Raymond "Piranha" Jones.

08:16.640 --> 08:20.060
The asset transfer, therefore,
was not legally binding.

08:20.140 --> 08:24.350
I got it expedited.
That's what I do for my clients.

08:24.440 --> 08:26.940
- What about the police?
- What about them?

08:27.900 --> 08:31.400
They'll roll around in litigation
for years and still lose.

08:31.490 --> 08:35.159
Until then, your money is yours.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.659
Your club. Everything.

08:39.950 --> 08:42.700
I hope this settles matters between us.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.880
Not by a damn sight.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.710
Ahhh!

08:53.380 --> 08:55.840
Did you skim money off me?

08:55.930 --> 08:57.260
No.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.140
No.

09:01.720 --> 09:02.720
Good.

09:07.810 --> 09:11.820
I thought they called you Big Ben.

09:28.540 --> 09:30.590
Call everyone home.

09:32.050 --> 09:36.010
It's good to have the money,
but we need the streets back.

09:36.970 --> 09:41.220
I want Bushmaster's head
on a goddamn platter.

09:41.310 --> 09:42.810
We just have to find him.

09:43.850 --> 09:46.730
Oh, we have help on that front.

09:47.270 --> 09:48.310
Hmm.

10:26.980 --> 10:28.520
Y'all meditating or something?

10:29.940 --> 10:33.900
Sometimes in silence, you can find
the best ways to communicate.

10:33.980 --> 10:38.070
Yeah, you should speak less, D.W.
You might learn something.

10:38.150 --> 10:41.990
But for real. What do you think?
Why hasn't Bushmaster come back yet?

10:43.990 --> 10:47.040
Tell me about the fight again.
Step by step.

10:48.250 --> 10:52.170
I don't know. We went at it.
Toe-to-toe. Blow-for...

10:53.040 --> 10:56.920
Man, who am I, Larry Merchant?
I whooped his ass. End of story.

10:57.010 --> 11:00.220
It's not the end of the story
if he's still out there, is it?

11:02.180 --> 11:03.470
Did he bleed?

11:04.050 --> 11:05.680
Yeah. So?

11:05.760 --> 11:06.970
Well, you don't.

11:07.060 --> 11:09.640
Not even after I clocked you
with this bad boy.

11:09.730 --> 11:11.650
You got lucky.

11:11.730 --> 11:14.270
Whatever, man. That's beside the point.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.610
The fact is, is that you don't bleed.

11:16.690 --> 11:20.030
And if he did, then maybe he's injured.

11:21.150 --> 11:22.320
You say he escaped?

11:23.240 --> 11:26.910
Yeah, he blew himself up.
Snuck a Hammer weapon into a paddy wagon.

11:27.740 --> 11:31.420
Okay. So, imagine the blast.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.130
You could take the hit

11:33.210 --> 11:35.460
because the shrapnel
would bounce right off of you.

11:35.540 --> 11:38.170
You told me
about your cellular regeneration.

11:38.260 --> 11:39.670
Yeah. I heal incredibly quickly.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.140
My skin hardens, strengthens my muscles.
Something like that.

11:43.220 --> 11:46.350
All right. Doesn't sound like he has that,
so if he is injured,

11:46.430 --> 11:50.480
then he'd probably have to go
to a hospital or a doctor or something.

11:50.560 --> 11:53.850
Yeah. He would need a doctor.

11:54.440 --> 11:57.230
Someone special. Off the books.

11:57.940 --> 12:02.530
Why didn't I think of that?
You're right. Let's go.

12:02.610 --> 12:04.950
- Where're we going?
- I'll tell you on the way.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.290
Okay. Let's do it.

12:09.950 --> 12:11.910
See? Silence is golden.

12:18.340 --> 12:19.590
I wasn't completely kidding.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.510
Silence was good.
I've been a little distracted lately.

12:23.590 --> 12:25.680
Yeah, I use it all the time.

12:26.340 --> 12:27.600
Where do you find it?

12:28.510 --> 12:31.270
In my head. My heart.

12:32.980 --> 12:35.270
Man, I love these streets.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.400
You can feel 'em, you know?
They make you focus.

12:40.530 --> 12:41.530
Not me.

12:43.950 --> 12:45.070
You seem different.

12:45.820 --> 12:47.950
Yeah. Guess I am different.

12:49.450 --> 12:51.040
Yeah, you seem settled.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.500
I'm still.

12:54.410 --> 12:58.340
You know, power comes
from stillness, Luke.

12:59.130 --> 13:02.760
No. Power comes
from getting shit done, Danny.

13:04.010 --> 13:05.220
We're almost there.

13:08.260 --> 13:11.180
Hey. Have you seen Nandi?

13:12.220 --> 13:14.980
No, but I, uh... I usually beat her in.
What's up?

13:16.060 --> 13:18.400
I wanna show you something. Over here.

13:19.650 --> 13:21.320
Come on, Bailey.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.410
This is dramatic.

13:35.160 --> 13:36.670
You talk to Nandi this morning?

13:38.000 --> 13:40.170
- Chief, what is this?
- Answer the question, Bailey.

13:41.800 --> 13:44.460
No, I haven't seen her. What's going on?

13:47.630 --> 13:49.260
When I left Nandi at Mother's Touch,

13:49.340 --> 13:51.220
she didn't know
where Luke and I were going.

13:51.300 --> 13:53.220
We didn't tell anyone.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.890
To keep the safe house
that Danny provided safe.

13:55.980 --> 13:59.520
To make sure that Mariah and Tilda
survived the bounty.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.270
I had no clue where you guys were going.

14:02.360 --> 14:03.360
And neither did Nandi.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.530
Until I came back to broker Mariah's deal.

14:06.610 --> 14:09.610
I came into this room,
and I told Ridley where we were.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.700
When someone uses their key card
to get in the room

14:11.780 --> 14:13.060
on the other side of this glass,

14:13.120 --> 14:15.410
there is a record of it.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.120
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, well, no one did.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.630
Internal Affairs installed it
two weeks ago.

14:20.710 --> 14:26.590
And Nandi used her card
at the same time Misty and I were in here.

14:28.840 --> 14:32.050
We have other investigations.
She could've left something behind.

14:34.720 --> 14:37.140
Luke could have called someone. Or Mariah.

14:37.230 --> 14:38.980
Mariah doesn't have a death wish.

14:40.020 --> 14:41.980
And Luke isn't careless.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.190
- Look, Bailey, my gut...
- Your gut? Your...

14:45.820 --> 14:47.440
Your gut trusted Scarfe, right?

14:48.030 --> 14:49.780
Wow. That was low.

14:51.950 --> 14:55.330
Nandi's right. You never liked her.
You never trusted her.

14:55.410 --> 14:57.000
But I trust you.

14:57.580 --> 14:59.460
Look, I don't wanna be right about this.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.880
Nandi deserves the benefit of the doubt.

15:01.960 --> 15:05.130
Well, then help us clear her.
Or bring her in.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.880
Because she might have
a direct line to Bushmaster.

15:14.760 --> 15:17.100
So this is why
you needed a safe house?

15:25.650 --> 15:27.360
Something bad happened here.

15:29.070 --> 15:31.320
Looks like something he was wearing
when I fought him.

15:33.740 --> 15:36.160
He must have come back here
after he escaped.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.450
Probably came here looking for her.

15:39.540 --> 15:43.080
Not just her. It. Nightshade.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.090
What's nightshade?

15:46.170 --> 15:49.970
It's a plant Tilda sold Bushmaster
before he attacked me the first time.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.430
She thinks it has something
to do with his healing,

15:52.510 --> 15:54.010
which gives him his strength.

15:54.090 --> 15:57.600
This place kinda reminds me
of an old apothecary back in K'un-Lun.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.770
Any sickness, any pain,

16:01.350 --> 16:04.060
Old Ming would have a leaf
or a remedy for it.

16:04.150 --> 16:06.230
Sound like Ming had the K-Town chronic.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.070
What do you know about The Chronic?

16:11.820 --> 16:15.950
Which one? I mean, I know
I'm supposed to say the original,

16:16.030 --> 16:18.450
but Chronic 2001 was kinda my favorite.

16:18.540 --> 16:20.660
Really? Why that one?

16:22.080 --> 16:24.960
Uh, it was the last album I got
from Tower Records

16:25.040 --> 16:26.710
before we boarded the plane.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.930
In K'un-Lun, our healers defined the body

16:40.020 --> 16:43.060
in terms of balancing
the three principles of function.

16:43.140 --> 16:46.690
There's Loong, mKhris-pa, Bad-Kan.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.770
Circulation, heat and cold.

16:48.860 --> 16:51.530
Now, you see, the last function, Bad-Kan,

16:51.610 --> 16:55.280
it encompasses our physical structure
and our mental stability.

16:56.320 --> 16:59.950
And if you manipulate it too much,
then you could lose your mind.

17:00.540 --> 17:02.750
Maybe that's what's going on
with Bushmaster.

17:07.420 --> 17:09.089
What is that? Grasshopper root?

17:09.170 --> 17:13.210
It says that nightshade is highly toxic.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.130
That the more you take it,
the less effective it is.

17:16.220 --> 17:20.180
Bad-Kan. You need more,
more frequently, and it's less effective.

17:20.760 --> 17:23.180
Like heroin. Chasing the dragon.

17:23.270 --> 17:24.270
Hmm.

17:25.230 --> 17:27.599
You think this is the only source?

17:27.690 --> 17:30.570
Well, her notes say
it only grows in Jamaica.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.820
There are many strains of this plant,

17:32.900 --> 17:35.780
but the only one with the healing mojo
is very distinctive.

17:35.860 --> 17:37.410
Couldn't it be replicated?

17:38.530 --> 17:41.280
I don't know. We have to ask Tilda.

17:42.120 --> 17:45.540
All right. How are we gonna find her?

17:46.460 --> 17:48.370
We gotta talk to her mother.

17:54.380 --> 17:55.880
What are you thinking about?

17:58.840 --> 18:00.100
My grandmother.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.220
My cousin.

18:03.310 --> 18:08.350
Everyone who has ever stood
on this very spot.

18:13.360 --> 18:16.030
It really is the best spot
in the whole club.

18:16.110 --> 18:17.900
It's the roost.

18:19.360 --> 18:21.530
Harlem is ruled from here.

18:22.620 --> 18:26.250
And when it's right,
it's like ruling the world.

18:40.890 --> 18:42.470
You had it the whole time?

18:44.890 --> 18:47.230
I had to make sure
that I could trust you again.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.900
Buggy gave this to my grandmother.

19:01.660 --> 19:03.200
She gave it to Cornell.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.120
Peasant.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.220
Wah gwaan?

19:43.240 --> 19:45.330
Hey, stop. Run it back.

19:49.410 --> 19:50.410
Right there.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.130
Shit.

20:05.850 --> 20:07.310
Why would she do this?

20:07.390 --> 20:09.270
I got a few million ideas.

20:11.560 --> 20:14.940
- What you got?
- Something. Show her.

20:16.190 --> 20:17.610
Yeah.

20:20.110 --> 20:22.070
I talked to the DA's office.

20:22.150 --> 20:24.570
We have a search warrant for her apartment

20:24.660 --> 20:26.120
and PC for an arrest.

20:26.200 --> 20:27.200
Close it down.

20:28.530 --> 20:31.120
You run her credit card numbers,
her phone numbers?

20:31.200 --> 20:32.910
Awaiting your permission.

20:37.590 --> 20:40.760
Got an Uber hit. Select Black.

20:40.840 --> 20:41.970
Where?

20:51.220 --> 20:52.480
You don't scare me.

20:52.560 --> 20:53.560
Ha!

20:55.440 --> 20:57.440
You're consumed with fear.

20:58.020 --> 21:00.360
You've been scared your whole life.

21:01.150 --> 21:06.030
You're like a frightened fowl
waiting for your neck to get cut.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.290
Oh, this place is nice.

21:16.330 --> 21:19.040
It's also pretty dangerous, Luke.

21:25.300 --> 21:26.970
Luke Cage is here...

21:28.140 --> 21:29.430
with Danny Rand.

21:31.220 --> 21:33.730
- I'm going out there.
- Why?

21:34.350 --> 21:36.100
So they won't come upstairs.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.320
Not gonna tell me this place reminds you
of some teahouse in K'un-Lun?

21:46.400 --> 21:50.120
Funny. You got a plan
if this goes sideways?

21:50.200 --> 21:55.080
I don't think I need one. Look at 'em.
I don't think they want it.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.080
Because you're bulletproof?

21:58.170 --> 22:01.710
Nah. 'Cause I just walked in here
with a billion dollars.

22:01.790 --> 22:05.170
I'm not so sure anybody wants
to bust a cap in Steve Jobs.

22:05.260 --> 22:08.720
Come on, dude. You always have to
make this about my money.

22:08.800 --> 22:11.470
I told you,
I don't even live off it anymore.

22:11.550 --> 22:14.140
You don't get it, do you?

22:14.220 --> 22:16.430
The glowing fist
is the least powerful thing about you.

22:16.520 --> 22:17.890
Especially up here.

22:19.100 --> 22:22.610
Stillness is power? No, money is power.

22:22.690 --> 22:23.780
That's what flows.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.610
That's the one thing they respect.
Trust me.

22:26.990 --> 22:29.320
Ah, Sugar.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.660
Fell back, huh?

22:31.740 --> 22:34.910
My car was damaged.
Didn't leave me much of a choice.

22:34.990 --> 22:39.290
We're not open till next week.
We have some cleaning to do.

22:40.580 --> 22:41.750
I'm looking for Bushmaster.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.050
Looks like you are, too.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.590
I've moved on. What you doing?

22:47.670 --> 22:48.970
No, you haven't.

22:49.930 --> 22:51.590
You need to chill.

22:51.680 --> 22:55.430
When you walked away from Rand,
you walked away from your immunity deal.

22:55.520 --> 22:56.560
Don't tear up the streets.

22:56.600 --> 22:58.730
That man came at my family.

22:58.810 --> 23:01.600
I will cut a mother
when it comes to my family.

23:02.730 --> 23:05.650
Speaking of... Where's Tilda?

23:06.400 --> 23:08.690
She's not here.

23:08.780 --> 23:10.110
What do you mean she's not here?

23:11.860 --> 23:15.540
Did you even go to Mother's Touch?
Do you even care if she's safe?

23:16.120 --> 23:21.120
She's gone her own way.
Children do that eventually.

23:21.210 --> 23:23.250
It's the curse of parenthood.

23:24.790 --> 23:27.960
So how's that fine-ass daddy of yours?

23:28.050 --> 23:32.050
You know,
there was something fun about him.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.430
There's nothing fun about you.

23:36.930 --> 23:40.180
I could have given your daddy
something to pray about.

23:41.850 --> 23:45.650
I'm sorry, Mr. Rand.
May I offer you something to drink?

23:45.730 --> 23:47.900
I'm good. Thanks.

23:49.440 --> 23:52.780
You can tear shit up if you want to.
It's just gonna waste time.

23:52.860 --> 23:55.120
You better find Bushmaster before I do.

23:56.080 --> 23:58.040
Don't do anything stupid, Mariah.

24:00.370 --> 24:04.960
Or actually, please, do something stupid.

24:05.840 --> 24:07.750
So I can take this whole thing down.

24:09.130 --> 24:10.720
Do your best.

24:12.430 --> 24:15.300
You should call Tilda. She might need you.

24:15.390 --> 24:18.350
You stay out of my business, hero.

24:19.890 --> 24:22.980
You just gave me an idea.
I wanna show you something.

24:27.610 --> 24:29.070
You surprised me.

24:29.150 --> 24:31.440
You're not even gagged.

24:31.530 --> 24:34.110
One peep and he would've been up here.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.200
My fate is sealed.

24:38.530 --> 24:39.540
Yours, too.

24:42.410 --> 24:47.040
There's nothing you can do
to make me give away Johnny.

24:49.420 --> 24:50.590
Ever.

24:52.720 --> 24:54.840
Don't be so sure, rude boy.

25:02.020 --> 25:03.020
Freeze!

25:09.730 --> 25:11.730
Misty.

25:13.150 --> 25:16.570
Bailey... I'm sorry, Mark,
this wasn't about you.

25:16.660 --> 25:17.660
Why?

25:17.740 --> 25:21.120
Look, y'all can talk about that shit
back at the precinct.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.120
You have the right to remain silent.

25:23.750 --> 25:27.580
- What? You not gonna turn around?
- Sure.

25:31.090 --> 25:32.550
- Freeze!
- I got her.

25:33.340 --> 25:34.700
Move in! Move in!

25:40.550 --> 25:41.550
Come on.

25:50.940 --> 25:51.940
Get up!

25:52.860 --> 25:54.570
Get up and take this ass-whoopin'.

25:56.860 --> 26:00.280
You are under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.450
I hate to admit it...

26:04.950 --> 26:06.370
I've never been up here.

26:07.670 --> 26:11.500
My father went to Columbia.
He used to bring me here all the time.

26:13.380 --> 26:14.510
It's beautiful.

26:16.300 --> 26:19.050
Hmm. It's still.

26:24.680 --> 26:25.810
What are you doing?

26:25.890 --> 26:29.350
That was good. Held your ground.

26:29.440 --> 26:31.150
Dude, we don't have time for this.

26:34.070 --> 26:37.190
Yeah, we do. Now come on, hit me.

26:37.280 --> 26:38.280
No.

26:54.170 --> 26:56.800
See? You're off-balance
because you're angry.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.130
- Hell yeah, I'm angry.
- About what?

26:59.220 --> 27:01.340
What does it
have to do with anything?

27:01.430 --> 27:02.430
Everything.

27:05.430 --> 27:06.720
We got a job to do, man.

27:06.810 --> 27:10.020
Yeah, don't you see? We're doing it.
You gotta rebalance your chi.

27:10.100 --> 27:11.400
Oh, come on, Danny.

27:12.230 --> 27:16.820
Power is stillness.
And stillness comes from effortless flow.

27:18.110 --> 27:21.070
You need to be relaxed within.
Even when you're going full force.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.870
When you clear your mind,
everything comes into focus.

27:27.410 --> 27:28.700
That's why we came up high.

27:31.250 --> 27:35.500
Mariah... she likes that perch
because she can see everything.

27:35.590 --> 27:36.960
Like a hawk.

27:40.420 --> 27:42.090
But Bushmaster's laying low.

27:43.340 --> 27:46.720
We don't need a bird's-eye view.
We need the perspective of a rat.

27:48.970 --> 27:52.810
All right.
So who's the biggest rat you know?

27:56.360 --> 27:57.900
That one's easy.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.330
You think you're better than me?

28:09.410 --> 28:12.540
You remember when Tasha Bowles
stole that iPod?

28:13.960 --> 28:16.090
When we were
at that away tournament in Philly?

28:16.170 --> 28:19.300
Of course I remember Tash.
She was our leading scorer.

28:19.380 --> 28:23.550
You could've let that slide,
but you didn't.

28:23.630 --> 28:26.850
You told Coach Shaw.
And Tasha got kicked off the team.

28:26.930 --> 28:32.390
And we got our asses
handed to us without her.

28:33.440 --> 28:37.110
No snitch. That was the rule,
but you didn't care.

28:37.610 --> 28:40.070
And everybody respected you for that.

28:40.940 --> 28:46.030
Especially a shy 14-year-old player
coming off the bench behind you.

28:46.120 --> 28:48.160
You gotta trust your teammates.

28:48.950 --> 28:51.620
Nothing is bigger than the team.

28:52.370 --> 28:53.830
Not even friendship.

28:55.080 --> 28:56.210
Or ego.

28:57.040 --> 28:59.250
That's funny.

29:00.090 --> 29:04.590
You know, I talked to Tasha
when we got back from Philly.

29:04.680 --> 29:07.890
Something about what went down
just always bothered me,

29:08.720 --> 29:10.930
'cause Tasha was good people.

29:11.020 --> 29:13.850
So I reached out,
and you know what she told me?

29:13.930 --> 29:16.940
She said that you and her made a deal.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.320
She would steal the iPod,

29:20.270 --> 29:22.440
and you were gonna hit some wallets.

29:23.990 --> 29:27.320
Except... you never did.

29:27.910 --> 29:31.450
Of course not. I'm smarter than that.

29:32.370 --> 29:36.250
You set her up
so that she would get kicked off the team,

29:36.330 --> 29:40.750
so that our one-two punch
would just be one. You.

29:41.340 --> 29:44.970
With her gone, the Temple
and La Salle scouts would just see you.

29:45.050 --> 29:48.180
We would lose, but you would shine.

29:48.260 --> 29:51.060
And even now it's still the same.

29:51.140 --> 29:53.770
And you have the nerve to sit up here

29:53.850 --> 29:57.060
and talk to me about
"nothing is bigger than the team"?

29:57.140 --> 29:58.770
Why are you still mad?

29:58.850 --> 30:01.320
I got injured in the third quarter.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.190
You came off the bench. You took my spot.

30:04.280 --> 30:07.700
I earned that spot.

30:08.280 --> 30:11.830
You looking down on me all saditty,
but what about you?

30:11.910 --> 30:13.870
Excuse me?

30:13.950 --> 30:17.670
You sold us out when you came in here
asking for immunity for Mariah.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.960
Like I said, I stepped up.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.130
There is a bigger threat out there
than just Mariah.

30:23.210 --> 30:27.420
Ridenhour's dead because of that woman.
She's a cancer to Harlem.

30:27.510 --> 30:30.470
Laundering gun money
to finance her campaign.

30:30.550 --> 30:34.560
Or killing her cousin Cottonmouth.
What about Candace?

30:40.230 --> 30:45.440
I read Candace's file. Silly girl.
She never should've trusted you.

30:45.530 --> 30:47.360
That was entirely your fault.

30:47.950 --> 30:50.320
After all of that,
you still wanna let that bitch walk?

30:50.410 --> 30:54.830
You sold us out to Bushmaster.
He is a homicidal maniac.

30:54.910 --> 30:59.580
Bushmaster just wants justice from Mariah.
Real justice.

30:59.670 --> 31:02.670
Mariah doesn't get to win. She's gotta go.

31:02.750 --> 31:05.960
And if somebody wants to take her out
and there's some cash left over?

31:06.050 --> 31:07.760
C'est la vie, bitch.

31:07.840 --> 31:09.720
I got my spot back. One way...

31:09.760 --> 31:12.010
This isn't some high-school bullshit!

31:12.600 --> 31:16.270
You almost had our blood on your hands,
and look at you.

31:16.350 --> 31:18.680
Even now you won't own your shit.

31:20.190 --> 31:22.270
And maybe you never will.

31:25.520 --> 31:27.030
You're not even worth it.

31:36.410 --> 31:41.040
Untie him. If he was gonna buck,
he would've done it already.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.000
He still could.

31:43.580 --> 31:45.170
Then you'll have to shoot him.

31:47.460 --> 31:50.760
Care for a drink? Rum perhaps?

31:52.550 --> 31:55.350
Nah. I lost my taste for it.

31:55.430 --> 31:57.510
Some things are
worth fighting for.

31:58.140 --> 32:00.430
I understand my grandfather.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.560
This is the smoothest rum
I've ever tasted.

32:03.650 --> 32:04.650
Enjoy.

32:05.980 --> 32:08.030
Prison or death are watching you.

32:08.110 --> 32:10.320
You don't have long
to experience such things.

32:11.200 --> 32:12.610
Longer than you.

32:14.570 --> 32:16.240
I lied to your friend.

32:17.450 --> 32:21.790
My grandfather built the distillery
based on Quincy's formula.

32:23.960 --> 32:27.290
Some of my earliest memories
of my grandfather

32:27.380 --> 32:31.340
are stories my grandmother told
about two dishwashers

32:31.420 --> 32:36.390
and their crazy dream of making
their own rum and owning a nightclub.

32:37.680 --> 32:41.230
Why do you think we fought so hard
for Harlem's Paradise?

32:42.850 --> 32:45.980
The Italian gangsters took the liquor.

32:46.060 --> 32:49.020
The Irish cops, protection.

32:49.110 --> 32:51.440
But we kept the real estate.

32:51.530 --> 32:54.070
Your grandfather was a slave.

32:56.410 --> 32:59.330
Buggy Stokes was freer
than you will ever be.

33:00.240 --> 33:02.410
That's the problem with you Yankees.

33:04.460 --> 33:07.040
You didn't have the strength to fight
your masters then.

33:07.130 --> 33:09.670
You're lazy.
You're content with the scraps.

33:09.750 --> 33:11.840
You're happy to sing and dance for them.

33:11.920 --> 33:17.220
Oh, please. Every Jamaican
talks that Maroon bullshit.

33:18.180 --> 33:22.310
What, y'all didn't get your freedom...
What? 1962.

33:22.980 --> 33:25.940
And then you got enslaved
by the World Bank.

33:26.020 --> 33:30.110
All you're known for is Marley,
marijuana and murder.

33:30.190 --> 33:33.400
Quincy McIver wanted to fight
the Italians and the Irish.

33:33.490 --> 33:35.110
He thought Buggy would've had his back.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.530
Buggy could only fight for one family.
And he chose the right one.

33:39.620 --> 33:42.200
He should've finished off
the whole raasclaat McIver family

33:42.290 --> 33:43.660
when he had the chance.

33:45.710 --> 33:47.920
What? You think this is funny?

33:48.000 --> 33:51.460
I laugh at my own folly.

33:52.460 --> 33:56.050
When Johnny declared war on you,
I felt sorry for you.

33:56.130 --> 33:59.640
I didn't want him to destroy you
the way the Stokes destroyed his family.

34:00.850 --> 34:06.390
But now I see you with my own two eyes,
and I understand the temptation.

34:08.400 --> 34:10.940
Your darkness matching his.

34:11.020 --> 34:14.110
You deserve all the brimstone
he's gonna bring upon you.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.820
Where is he?

34:20.909 --> 34:25.500
I don't know.
And I wouldn't tell you even if I did.

34:25.580 --> 34:27.710
But I'll tell you like I tell him.

34:28.290 --> 34:33.500
When one seek vengeance,
he must dig two graves.

34:34.210 --> 34:37.300
That's not enough holes for me.

34:43.760 --> 34:44.770
Turk.

34:49.480 --> 34:51.520
Come on, man. Not tonight.

34:52.230 --> 34:54.110
Yep, tonight.

34:54.820 --> 34:56.820
It's not what you think.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.780
God damn! And you brought him, too?

35:00.110 --> 35:01.120
It's Danny.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.870
Yeah, I know who you are.

35:02.950 --> 35:05.450
Madame Gao was no joke.
I heard how you got in the mix

35:05.540 --> 35:08.330
and got my Asian brothers
all shook and shit.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.790
So you opened a head shop, huh?

35:09.870 --> 35:11.580
Hey, I followed the money, baby.

35:11.670 --> 35:17.260
Colorado. California. Washington.
My cousin started this shit.

35:17.710 --> 35:22.890
We're making so much money selling
legal gear to all the dispensaries,

35:22.970 --> 35:25.010
I haven't done any crooked shit in months.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.270
Why'd I have to go
through all this drama to find you?

35:27.350 --> 35:32.400
I have a reputation to uphold.
Being nefarious is good for business.

35:33.020 --> 35:37.070
Hey, Luke... I like this one.

35:37.150 --> 35:38.530
You smoke?

35:38.610 --> 35:42.910
You looking for Bushmaster?
I heard he kicked your ass and bounced.

35:42.990 --> 35:45.410
Hey, for the last time, man,
it was the other way around.

35:46.120 --> 35:47.370
Kicked my ass...

35:55.210 --> 35:56.210
Wow.

35:56.300 --> 35:59.630
Yeah. That's a nice one, right?

35:59.720 --> 36:01.930
- Got a lot of nice glass.
- Yeah.

36:02.010 --> 36:03.840
Mmm-hmm.

36:03.930 --> 36:05.300
Oops

36:06.310 --> 36:08.350
So you gonna tell me what I need to know?

36:11.190 --> 36:12.690
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:13.810 --> 36:14.810
Okay.

36:15.900 --> 36:18.860
Word on the street
is that the gangs are pissed

36:18.940 --> 36:21.900
that the Jamaicans are driving everyone
out of the weed business.

36:21.990 --> 36:23.200
- Why?
- I don't know.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.280
But they've taken over

36:24.360 --> 36:26.280
one of the biggest grow houses
in the city.

36:27.410 --> 36:28.410
Nightshade.

36:30.580 --> 36:32.120
Where is this grow house?

36:32.830 --> 36:34.960
Abandoned warehouse out near Rucker Park.

36:35.750 --> 36:36.920
That's all I got.

36:39.550 --> 36:42.800
Your aura's dope. Who you train with?

36:43.760 --> 36:45.520
- I trained with Master...
- Let's go, Danny.

36:46.470 --> 36:48.600
Hey, you gonna pay for that?

36:48.680 --> 36:49.720
Bill me!

36:58.020 --> 36:59.150
Hurry up!

36:59.230 --> 37:01.650
We're definitely in the right spot.

37:01.740 --> 37:03.610
Bet this place is a fortress.

37:05.530 --> 37:08.370
- Do I look fazed?
- Do I?

39:22.830 --> 39:23.840
Patty-cake.

39:24.880 --> 39:25.880
What?

39:25.960 --> 39:29.550
Fire it up and hit my hands.
I'm ready this time.

40:15.180 --> 40:16.180
Luke.

40:25.310 --> 40:26.650
Stillness.

40:51.170 --> 40:52.340
Where's Bushmaster?

40:52.420 --> 40:54.840
Look, man,
I don't know where he is.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.640
- You're kidding me?
- It's just us.

40:56.720 --> 40:59.760
- Bushmaster doesn't come in here.
- You're growing all this nightshade,

40:59.850 --> 41:01.770
all this firepower,
and he's never been here?

41:01.850 --> 41:04.140
We work on the plants, that's all.

41:04.230 --> 41:07.020
Everything we do
is to cultivate and protect this.

41:08.480 --> 41:10.160
Where's the rest of the nightshade?

41:10.230 --> 41:11.940
There's no more. I swear.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.070
Could he use this?

41:15.910 --> 41:17.910
- Answer him!
- Not like that!

41:18.450 --> 41:20.790
He'd need the mature flower
before he could use it.

41:20.870 --> 41:25.290
But the plant can't grow properly
without Jamaican soil or sunlight.

41:25.370 --> 41:27.460
It just withers.

41:34.090 --> 41:35.180
Come on, man.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.090
Get outta here now.

41:40.260 --> 41:41.390
This whole room is a nursery

41:41.470 --> 41:44.180
so he can have a never-ending supply
to power himself up.

41:44.270 --> 41:46.350
Well, not anymore.

41:51.360 --> 41:52.800
Well, that's the end of that.

41:55.110 --> 41:57.410
A bit much to burn the whole thing down,
don't you think?

41:57.490 --> 41:59.240
Eh. Only way to be sure.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.870
Besides, I got Rand
to purchase the building

42:01.950 --> 42:05.000
and the lot underneath it,
so no harm done.

42:05.080 --> 42:08.080
I mean, it's not like I'm gonna
pursue a complaint, is it?

42:10.880 --> 42:12.750
You're right, though.

42:13.880 --> 42:15.470
Money is power.

42:16.050 --> 42:18.430
I hate to admit it, but it's true.

42:18.510 --> 42:21.760
Yeah, well, real power
comes from someplace else, right?

42:26.310 --> 42:27.770
Chi?

42:27.850 --> 42:29.480
You said it, not me.

42:29.560 --> 42:30.560
Let's go.

42:48.500 --> 42:52.670
IA is gonna be up our asses
all over again for that one.

42:52.750 --> 42:55.670
She's going to prison.
That's all that matters.

42:55.760 --> 42:59.970
No, that's not all that matters.
Detective Knight, my office.

43:09.020 --> 43:12.360
IA investigation notwithstanding,
I was very impressed

43:12.440 --> 43:16.030
with how you handled the situation
with Detective Tyler.

43:17.360 --> 43:19.320
Thank you, Deputy Chief.

43:21.740 --> 43:23.280
You and I have had our differences.

43:23.910 --> 43:25.700
Still do.

43:27.750 --> 43:29.660
But I respect your sacrifice,

43:31.290 --> 43:33.590
even if the rest of the world
doesn't know.

43:37.710 --> 43:40.050
I was briefed on what really happened
at Midland Circle.

43:40.130 --> 43:42.800
And your work ethic,

43:42.890 --> 43:46.430
your determination to do right by Harlem,

43:47.520 --> 43:49.350
it should be rewarded.

43:49.430 --> 43:51.900
Especially seeing how
my tenure here is temporary.

43:54.190 --> 43:57.280
I'm sorry, Priscilla.
What is it exactly you're getting at?

43:57.900 --> 44:01.400
Harlem deserves a legitimate champion,
not just a vigilante.

44:02.200 --> 44:05.950
And once I return to One Police Plaza,
this precinct will need a new commander.

44:07.290 --> 44:08.660
I think it should be you.

44:15.790 --> 44:17.210
But I'm just a detective.

44:17.300 --> 44:20.880
Detective first grade.
Best I've ever seen.

44:20.970 --> 44:21.970
Still.

44:25.140 --> 44:27.390
I mean, has that ever
even happened before?

44:29.560 --> 44:33.440
We now live in a world
with bulletproof black men, Mercedes.

44:34.980 --> 44:36.940
There's no such thing as precedent.

44:42.280 --> 44:45.370
The largest grow house in Harlem
just went up in flames.

44:45.450 --> 44:47.080
No sign of Bushmaster.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.870
Luke Cage is doing our dirty work for us.

44:49.950 --> 44:52.370
Now is the time to strike.

44:52.460 --> 44:55.670
Right through Bushmaster's
bumboclaat heart.

44:55.750 --> 44:57.960
This is a good leverage play.

44:58.040 --> 45:01.550
We're gonna go in
and give Bushmaster's people an ultimatum.

45:01.630 --> 45:04.180
It's all about the message. No doubt.

45:04.260 --> 45:08.180
Whatever you're gonna do to me,
just do it.

45:08.260 --> 45:09.640
This don't feel right.

45:10.270 --> 45:13.980
Ain't supposed to feel.
You just do. We soldiers.

45:15.150 --> 45:16.480
This feels right to you?

45:16.560 --> 45:19.070
Marching a dude down the block
as we head to a restaurant?

45:19.150 --> 45:20.280
This is off.

45:21.400 --> 45:22.900
I ain't doing this shit.

45:23.740 --> 45:24.740
What?

45:26.360 --> 45:28.780
Shoot me. I don't care.

45:29.410 --> 45:30.620
We ain't got time for this.

45:30.700 --> 45:33.160
You pull out,
she gonna come looking for you.

45:33.250 --> 45:35.830
Let her come. I'm done.

45:58.350 --> 46:00.110
Easy, people. Easy.

46:01.110 --> 46:02.190
Don't move.

46:04.240 --> 46:08.360
Listen, we don't have much money.
Just take what you want and go.

46:08.450 --> 46:10.570
Sit your ass down. This ain't no robbery!

46:16.870 --> 46:19.290
Sit down. Shut up.

46:23.000 --> 46:24.880
Ingrid!

46:29.800 --> 46:31.640
Please don't do this.

46:32.470 --> 46:35.770
Billie, it was you.

46:37.730 --> 46:40.270
That's how he knew about Piranha.

46:41.440 --> 46:45.360
That's how he knew how to get to me.
And where.

46:47.030 --> 46:49.700
Ms. Dillard, please.

46:51.990 --> 46:57.000
The name is Stokes. Mariah Stokes.

46:57.910 --> 46:59.170
No...

47:02.460 --> 47:04.460
Please, sir! Please.

47:04.550 --> 47:07.220
No! No! No! Ah!

47:07.300 --> 47:09.050
Please, sir! Please!

47:57.140 --> 47:58.180
Ingrid?

48:01.190 --> 48:02.190
Ingrid...

48:05.230 --> 48:06.270
I'm sorry.

48:10.650 --> 48:12.490
This is not what we talked about.

48:12.570 --> 48:15.910
We're sending a message.
Just like we said.

48:19.120 --> 48:20.290
I'm so sorry.

48:21.910 --> 48:23.120
I'm sorry.

48:28.420 --> 48:33.890
Let's see if your nephew is right
about the cleansing power of fire.

48:35.640 --> 48:39.020
I'm gonna haunt you
for the rest of your days.

48:40.020 --> 48:43.390
You're gonna eat, but you won't taste.

48:44.940 --> 48:48.020
You're gonna sleep, but you won't rest.

48:51.280 --> 48:55.070
Everything you love, you gonna lose!
You hear me?

49:01.370 --> 49:04.500
You hear me? You hear me?

49:22.480 --> 49:24.480
Jesus! Die already!

49:28.520 --> 49:30.530
Bushmaster will come to us now.

49:32.490 --> 49:33.950
He has to.

49:37.160 --> 49:38.910
He was wrong, Hernan.

49:40.990 --> 49:42.580
I'm no one's slave.

49:43.960 --> 49:45.160
I'm free.

52:05.300 --> 52:06.970
More sweet and sour chicken?

52:07.060 --> 52:10.980
Mmm-mmm. No thanks, Connie. I'm good.

52:11.060 --> 52:12.850
Do you have any more of this mu shu pork?

52:12.940 --> 52:15.940
I've been everywhere,
but this is by far the best I've ever had.

52:16.020 --> 52:18.610
You guys certainly worked up an appetite.

52:18.690 --> 52:20.190
Most definitely.

52:21.570 --> 52:22.740
You okay?

52:23.660 --> 52:25.950
Yeah, everyone keeps asking me that.

52:26.030 --> 52:27.290
I'm fine.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.750
We have more places to rent
if you need a place.

52:30.830 --> 52:33.420
Yeah, so I can
blow that one up, too?

52:33.500 --> 52:34.830
No, I can't take the risk.

52:34.920 --> 52:37.590
Don't worry about it. We're insured.

52:43.590 --> 52:46.600
Uh-oh.
You have that look in your eye again.

52:47.890 --> 52:49.600
You got some Zen shit to say?

52:49.680 --> 52:51.020
Nah, dude.

52:51.100 --> 52:54.650
Look, I just wanna eat my mu shu
and take a long-ass nap.

52:54.730 --> 52:55.860
Good.

52:56.440 --> 53:00.230
'Cause there's no way you can convince me
that there's some mystical force within

53:00.320 --> 53:03.990
that I can channel to solve
all the problems that we've talked about.

53:04.070 --> 53:06.200
Come on. Are you kidding me?

53:06.280 --> 53:08.280
Even after the way you fought?

53:09.580 --> 53:10.750
I saw it.

53:10.830 --> 53:13.660
You had this... this look on your face.

53:13.750 --> 53:14.750
This flow.

53:15.960 --> 53:18.920
I was in the zone, man.
It was like a runner's high.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.340
Nah.

53:20.420 --> 53:22.420
You had everything aligned.

53:22.510 --> 53:24.880
Mind, body, spirit.

53:26.550 --> 53:30.680
Look, I know it can be a lot,
taking on everything by yourself.

53:30.770 --> 53:32.350
But you need to realize

53:33.180 --> 53:35.730
Harlem was here long before you.

53:35.810 --> 53:38.940
And it will still stand long after you.

53:39.020 --> 53:40.690
Easy for you to say.

53:40.780 --> 53:43.030
People always talking to me
about walking away.

53:43.110 --> 53:46.240
But nobody understands
what it's like to have these abilities.

53:47.070 --> 53:48.070
I get it.

53:49.080 --> 53:51.620
But you don't have to carry
this burden by yourself.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.290
Yeah.

53:53.370 --> 53:55.580
You're downtown. I'm uptown.

53:55.670 --> 53:58.460
Same island. Same city.

53:58.540 --> 54:02.420
We're just defending
different neighborhoods, together.

54:02.510 --> 54:04.550
You're on that Matt Murdock shit.

54:05.090 --> 54:08.300
Look, I'm just living my life day to day.
In Harlem.

54:08.390 --> 54:10.390
Come on, man. That's bullshit.

54:10.470 --> 54:11.810
You know it.

54:11.890 --> 54:15.350
You heard the call just like I did,
from inside.

54:16.600 --> 54:19.110
You don't run from sirens.

54:19.190 --> 54:20.690
You run towards them.

54:21.440 --> 54:25.110
And that? That, my friend,
is what makes a hero.

54:27.030 --> 54:28.030
Maybe.

54:29.490 --> 54:32.490
Not too long ago
someone told me that, uh,

54:32.580 --> 54:35.000
"Not every siren is for you."

54:35.080 --> 54:39.540
Yeah.
It sounds like Claire all day.

54:42.290 --> 54:45.050
Look, dude,
I'm gonna be honest with you.

54:45.130 --> 54:48.130
Claire, she asked me
to come and check on you.

54:48.220 --> 54:49.970
You talked to Claire?

54:50.760 --> 54:52.470
She's worried about you.

54:53.060 --> 54:55.310
About your anger. What it's doing to you.

54:56.640 --> 55:01.310
How do you expect to defend a city
if you're at war with yourself?

55:03.690 --> 55:05.610
Why didn't she call me?

55:06.360 --> 55:07.490
You know why.

55:11.240 --> 55:15.290
At least that's what she told me to say
in case you asked. I...

55:15.370 --> 55:16.910
I didn't ask her why.

55:19.330 --> 55:21.330
Look, Luke...

55:22.670 --> 55:23.920
you're not alone.

55:25.000 --> 55:26.130
I've got your back.

55:26.840 --> 55:29.050
So does Misty. So does Jessica.

55:29.130 --> 55:30.970
And I know
it doesn't feel like it right now,

55:31.050 --> 55:33.390
but Claire...

55:35.220 --> 55:36.770
she's got your back, too.

55:38.770 --> 55:42.860
Yeah, well, sometimes you...
you gotta face things head on.

55:43.690 --> 55:44.820
On your own.

55:45.900 --> 55:47.530
Oh, boy.

55:48.900 --> 55:51.200
You're starting to sound like I did.
It's not good.

55:52.570 --> 55:53.950
Stubborn.

55:54.030 --> 55:55.030
No.

55:55.620 --> 55:58.040
I'm focused.

56:01.120 --> 56:04.790
Well, as you think, so you shall become.

56:04.880 --> 56:06.920
- Hmm, Claire again?
- Nah.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.340
Well, close. Bruce Lee.

56:09.840 --> 56:13.800
Yeah, yeah.
D.W.'s gonna like that one.

56:13.890 --> 56:14.720
Yep.

56:14.800 --> 56:16.180
Definitely going on a T-shirt.

56:16.260 --> 56:17.300
Uh-huh.

56:18.430 --> 56:21.600
Hey, look, man... between me and you,

56:22.810 --> 56:25.270
that dragon that you fought...

56:25.360 --> 56:27.150
that was metaphorical, right?

56:28.480 --> 56:29.610
It wasn't actually real?

56:30.780 --> 56:33.280
Man, I don't get you.

56:36.580 --> 56:39.370
You can accept
that you're bulletproof, right?

56:40.200 --> 56:43.870
And you can accept that my hand
it... it glows?

56:46.590 --> 56:47.880
But you can't accept a dragon?

56:48.460 --> 56:49.590
Hell no.

56:51.510 --> 56:52.630
Whatever, man.

56:52.720 --> 56:54.180
- And I'm crazy?
- Yep.

56:54.260 --> 56:56.800
- You're the one seeing dragons, man.
- Come on.

56:57.390 --> 56:59.430
One day, I'm gonna take you to K'un-Lun.

56:59.520 --> 57:02.810
I'm gonna introduce you to Shou-Lao.

57:02.890 --> 57:05.520
"K'un-Lun." "Shou-Lao."
Where do you get these names from?

57:05.600 --> 57:07.360
Dude, have some respect.

57:07.440 --> 57:08.820
- Okay.
- It's my history.

57:08.900 --> 57:10.190
Okay, it's your history.
