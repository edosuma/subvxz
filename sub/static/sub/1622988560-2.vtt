12:19.823 --> 12:21.658
married with teenage children,

12:21.700 --> 12:23.702
and deep ties to his community.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.953
He owns a home.

12:24.995 --> 12:27.372
He has no criminal record
and is not a flight risk.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.291
Ms. Boyle.

12:30.375 --> 12:31.585
Your Honor,

12:31.626 --> 12:33.795
Mr. Franzen most certainly is
a flight risk.

12:33.837 --> 12:36.756
He has unlimited resources
and ample reason to flee.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.592
The scope of his scheme
to defraud

12:38.633 --> 12:40.177
his investors is vast.

12:40.218 --> 12:41.845
And we have 230 witnesses

12:41.887 --> 12:43.805
who will attest to
his cupidity under oath.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.391
I hope you're not planning
to call all 230 of them.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.934
A representative sample will do.

12:47.976 --> 12:49.811
Your Honor.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.521
What bail did you have
in mind, Ms. Boyle?

12:51.563 --> 12:54.399
Considering how many people
Mr. Franzen defrauded,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.359
how about $230 million?

12:56.401 --> 12:58.028
- A million a pop.
- Your Honor...

12:58.069 --> 13:00.739
Bail is set at
one and a half million dollars.

13:02.741 --> 13:05.744
[siren passing in distance]

13:10.290 --> 13:12.459
[Ally] There must be
some mistake.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.211
Where were you New Year's Eve?

13:14.252 --> 13:16.296
- A séance.
- Séance?

13:16.338 --> 13:18.840
- At the Magic Castle.
- From when to when?

13:18.882 --> 13:21.968
10:00 to 2:00, or so.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.929
- [Bosch] Did you drive?
- I drove.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.597
My friend Amber
drove us all home.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.474
- Designated driver.
- Correct.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.309
- Good for you.
- Hmm.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.520
Did somebody use your car
while you were, uh,

13:31.561 --> 13:33.021
communing with the spirits?

13:33.063 --> 13:34.898
What? No. Why?

13:34.940 --> 13:37.567
- Where'd you park?
- Valet. I never park
on the streets,

13:37.609 --> 13:39.861
especially in Hollywood.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.281
OMG.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.035
Did one of the valets
use my car to commit a crime?

13:47.077 --> 13:49.037
A question
we're trying to answer.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.956
[scoffs] You know,

13:50.997 --> 13:53.875
I thought the car smelled
kind of funny, like

13:53.917 --> 13:55.627
nail polish remover, you know?

13:55.669 --> 13:57.420
Hasn't been washed in a while.

13:57.462 --> 13:58.797
I'm embarrassed.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.465
I've been so busy
with the store.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.051
- I made an appointment
to get it detailed.
- Cancel it.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.845
We need to impound your vehicle,
run it for prints and evidence.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.556
When do I get it back?

14:07.597 --> 14:09.307
When we're done with it.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.615
Come see a show.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.534
Thought it was members only.

14:27.576 --> 14:29.578
Give me your e-mail address,
I'll get one of the magicians

14:29.619 --> 14:31.580
to send you an invite.

14:31.621 --> 14:33.623
Everybody that was on
that night.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.792
- You were busy?
- Full up.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.711
Lot of cars to keep track of.

14:37.752 --> 14:39.754
- We manage.
- Busy enough for somebody

14:39.796 --> 14:41.464
to borrow a customer's car
for a couple hours?

14:41.506 --> 14:42.924
Without my guys knowing? No way.

14:42.966 --> 14:44.384
[Edgar] Let's talk
about your guys.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.886
Customers inside,
popping the cork--

14:46.928 --> 14:49.556
why not take one of these
fancy whips for a joyride?

14:49.598 --> 14:51.766
You take a Lambo or a Ferrari
for a joyride,

14:51.808 --> 14:53.351
not a Mercedes SUV.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.354
We have video
of a dark gray Mercedes SUV,

14:56.396 --> 14:58.023
East Hollywood,
same time the owner was here

14:58.064 --> 14:59.232
whooping it up New Year's.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.775
- Not possible.
- Definitely possible.

15:00.817 --> 15:01.943
Plates match.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.528
Maybe the owner loaned it
to somebody.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.530
- She says no.
- Maybe she's lying.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.740
[Bosch] Maybe she is.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.908
People lie to us all the time.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.411
Not me.

15:11.453 --> 15:14.247
You contact anybody
on this list to warn them,

15:14.289 --> 15:16.958
I'm gonna charge you
as an accessory.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.587
Accessory? Accessory to what?

15:20.629 --> 15:22.797
[Alexander] How's Jun
holding up?

15:22.839 --> 15:24.299
She's a rock.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.759
And you?

15:27.302 --> 15:29.012
Cautiously optimistic.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.181
Little guy's a fighter.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.849
Like his dad.

15:32.891 --> 15:34.976
- Like his mom.
- [chuckles]

15:37.437 --> 15:39.314
Thanks for meeting me.

15:39.356 --> 15:41.650
Ah, I'm glad you reached out.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.401
I've been meaning to call.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.819
About what?

15:46.279 --> 15:47.530
You first.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.240
You invited me.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.870
There's a... [clears throat]

15:53.912 --> 15:56.790
a rumor going around
that you're stepping down.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.917
I hope it's not true.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.003
I'm counting on your vote
in support of my second term.

16:05.423 --> 16:06.966
[sighs]

16:07.008 --> 16:09.302
I'm sorry to ambush you.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.764
It's true?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.100
Afraid so.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.602
When?

16:17.644 --> 16:19.437
Immediately, more or less.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.231
You can't put it off?

16:22.399 --> 16:25.276
Not till then. No.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.655
[takes deep breath]

16:28.697 --> 16:31.241
Look, Francis, I hate to ask...

16:31.282 --> 16:32.617
[sighs]

16:32.659 --> 16:34.994
...but I can do the math.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.789
Right now,
it's three-two in my favor.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.666
You leave,
Lopez appoints your replacement,

16:39.708 --> 16:41.292
then it's three-two against.

16:41.334 --> 16:42.961
You don't know that.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.963
I do.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.464
She's freezing me out.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.716
Why?

16:48.758 --> 16:50.552
Best guess?

16:50.593 --> 16:52.595
She wants a Latino chief.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.934
I can't.

16:58.935 --> 17:00.395
I'm sorry.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.982
[sighs]

17:04.023 --> 17:05.567
All right.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.444
I respect that.

17:15.243 --> 17:18.079
Stage IV pancreatic cancer.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.878
Jesus, Francis.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.671
[chuckles]

17:28.423 --> 17:30.717
I swore I wasn't gonna play
the cancer card.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.679
[sighs]

17:34.721 --> 17:36.973
I wish I could hang in there
for you.

17:38.016 --> 17:40.351
Don't be silly.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.395
[sighs]

17:42.437 --> 17:44.230
Just get better.

17:46.941 --> 17:48.610
Yeah. Well.

17:58.661 --> 18:01.331
[Irving] Hey. I've got this.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.876
Thank you.

18:09.130 --> 18:10.590
You, uh...

18:10.632 --> 18:12.467
you give Jun my best.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.636
Same to Margaret.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.930
Take care of yourself, Irv.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.389
You, too.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.600
See you soon.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.851
You bet.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.990
[sighs]

18:41.454 --> 18:42.831
[sighs]

18:55.593 --> 18:57.387
[line rings]

18:57.428 --> 18:59.556
[Kowski] You've reached
the voice mail of Jen Kowski,

18:59.597 --> 19:01.516
special assistant to the mayor.

19:01.558 --> 19:03.852
- Please leave a message.
- [beep]

19:05.061 --> 19:07.480
- Call me back.
- [Chandler] Are you all right?

19:07.522 --> 19:09.983
Yeah. I'm-I'm great.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.318
I mean, I could, uh,
I could use a hot shower

19:12.360 --> 19:14.112
and a change of clothes.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.990
Have a seat, Mr. Franzen.

19:17.031 --> 19:18.658
[intercom beeps]

19:18.700 --> 19:21.160
Maddie, would you mind
getting us some coffee?

19:21.202 --> 19:22.662
- [Maddie] Right away.
- Thank you.

19:23.705 --> 19:25.623
So, you survived
your night in stir.

19:25.665 --> 19:26.833
[exhales] Yeah.

19:26.875 --> 19:29.335
[sniffs] Zero shuteye.
Didn't sleep a wink.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.546
My God, the... the noise

19:31.588 --> 19:33.256
- and the lights...
- First time?

19:33.298 --> 19:34.716
[chuckles] Fuck yeah.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.467
Yeah, I mean,
I spent a couple hours

19:36.509 --> 19:38.303
in the drunk tank once, but...

19:39.345 --> 19:41.389
Otherwise...

19:41.431 --> 19:42.849
[exhales]

19:47.645 --> 19:48.855
Look.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.401
I'm not a brave person.

19:53.443 --> 19:55.653
Okay? I j...
I don't have the DNA.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.572
So I can't do time.

19:57.614 --> 19:59.032
I just can't.

19:59.073 --> 20:00.992
Okay.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.995
Let's talk about how to make
sure that doesn't happen.

20:04.037 --> 20:06.039
- [quiet chatter]
- [phones ringing]

20:07.582 --> 20:10.043
- [beep]
- [sighs]

20:14.047 --> 20:16.132
Choir boys.

20:16.174 --> 20:19.385
No warrants, no arrests,
no likelies in my half.

20:19.427 --> 20:20.929
Start with this guy.

20:20.970 --> 20:22.221
Parolee. Gangbanger.

20:22.263 --> 20:23.640
Parolee for what?

20:23.681 --> 20:25.016
Grand theft auto.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.435
And he's working as a valet?

20:27.477 --> 20:28.853
What they call irony.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.357
"Russell Barnes."
Doesn't sound Las Palmas.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.149
Nah, he's a Crip.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.109
Let's go lean on him.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.697
The D.A. has a hornets' nest
of aggrieved former clients

20:39.739 --> 20:41.658
eager to testify against you.

20:41.699 --> 20:44.827
So I think the last thing
we want to do is go to trial.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.371
Which means a plea.

20:46.412 --> 20:49.123
Right, and as I said,
I-I... I can't do time.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.459
- Any time.
- Full disclosure:

20:51.501 --> 20:53.378
testify against
your coconspirators.

20:53.419 --> 20:55.171
That's not a problem.
Bunch of mutts.

20:55.213 --> 20:57.048
As much restitution as possible.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.925
[sighs] Oh, Jesus.

20:58.967 --> 21:00.802
And I think we can get you
a light sentence

21:00.843 --> 21:02.303
in a minimum security facility.

21:02.345 --> 21:05.056
[laughs] Okay, you-you listen
but you don't hear.

21:05.098 --> 21:06.724
It wouldn't be like county jail.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.101
It's more like Club Fed.

21:08.142 --> 21:09.936
How can I be any clearer?

21:09.978 --> 21:12.230
No time. None.

21:12.271 --> 21:13.856
It's a deal breaker.

21:13.898 --> 21:15.525
Okay.

21:18.361 --> 21:19.821
[sighs]

21:22.865 --> 21:24.701
I need something
I can work with.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.955
Right.

21:28.997 --> 21:30.999
[takes deep breath]

21:32.458 --> 21:34.377
A really big fish?

21:34.419 --> 21:36.421
Bigger than you?

21:36.462 --> 21:37.672
Yes, much bigger.

21:37.714 --> 21:40.800
Uh, yes, a-a muy grande pescado.

21:40.842 --> 21:42.510
A fish that makes
Michael Milken look like

21:42.552 --> 21:43.970
a 12-year-old altar boy
filching bills

21:44.012 --> 21:45.930
- out of the collection plate.
- [door closes]

21:46.973 --> 21:48.766
- [Chandler] Uh,
thank you, Maddie.
- Of course.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.275
[exhales] We'll need to get
the SEC on board.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.193
Insider trading?

21:59.235 --> 22:00.737
Yeah. You bet.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.280
I'll reach out to the SEC.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.241
Maybe, uh... maybe we can
get you probation.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.325
Mm-hmm.

22:06.367 --> 22:07.994
Community service,
a hefty fine...

22:08.036 --> 22:10.121
- How hefty?
- Hefty.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.290
- Instead of restitution?
- In addition to.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.875
Aw, Jesus. [exhales]

22:13.916 --> 22:15.084
Okay.

22:15.126 --> 22:16.627
If this other crime
is as massive

22:16.669 --> 22:18.212
- as you say...
- It is.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.964
Which you are not involved in?

22:20.006 --> 22:21.340
Not even a hint of a scintilla.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.593
It's gonna be a huge story.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.928
Media will be camped out
in your azaleas.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.056
Mm. They already are.

22:28.097 --> 22:29.390
Well, we'll deal with that.

22:29.432 --> 22:31.934
First things first.

22:31.976 --> 22:33.394
Tell me everything.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.523
[dog barking in distance]

22:37.565 --> 22:39.567
[birds chirping]

22:44.864 --> 22:47.492
You take the lead with Barnes.
He'll deny it.

22:47.533 --> 22:49.702
Then we'll tell him
we found his prints in the car.

22:49.744 --> 22:52.038
- He's a valet.
- Exactly what he'll say.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.124
- Then we got him in a lie.
- Right.

22:57.293 --> 22:59.504
Gary Wise's old hood.

22:59.545 --> 23:00.963
Yep.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.553
How's it going with the shrink?
