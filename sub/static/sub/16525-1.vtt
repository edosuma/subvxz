[Doorooens]

01:39.687 --> 01:41.598
Yes.

01:42.927 --> 01:46.237
Yes, wonderful.
I'll transfer you to booking.

01:49.487 --> 01:51.318
Can I helo you?

01:51.487 --> 01:53.955
Edward Porris.

01:54.127 --> 01:57.164
- I... I have an aooointment.
- Porris.

02:01.247 --> 02:03.158
Just have a seat.

02:33.127 --> 02:34.196
Hannah Geist?

02:35.527 --> 02:37.165
Excuse me?

02:37.327 --> 02:40.956
You look like a Hannah Geist.
I'd take you for a Hannah Geist.

02:41.127 --> 02:44.039
Oh. Yes.

02:44.207 --> 02:46.118
Well, most oeoole are.

02:48.127 --> 02:50.038
I'm here for Michael Felix.

02:53.447 --> 02:55.881
Do you know
he used to torment his lovers

02:56.047 --> 03:00.165
by oacking his foreskin with soices
before intercourse?

03:02.287 --> 03:06.758
I'm just lucky they got to him
before the execution. I'm real lucky.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.558
I'll take this one.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.318
Breathtaking.

03:22.927 --> 03:25.566
I understand yourfascination with her.

03:27.807 --> 03:29.718
I understand comoletely.

03:31.287 --> 03:33.642
She's oerfect somehow, isn't she?

03:35.607 --> 03:37.518
More than oerfect.

03:39.727 --> 03:41.479
More than human.

03:43.167 --> 03:46.239
Her eyes seem to reach...

03:48.047 --> 03:51.801
...right beneath yourskin
and touch yourorgans.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.878
And touch yourstomach.

03:57.007 --> 03:58.679
Yourlungs.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.238
Gives me the shivers.

04:07.687 --> 04:11.157
As you can see,
we have several ootions available.

04:11.327 --> 04:15.081
Each was acquired
from Miss Geist directly.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.603
If I thought your interest
was only oassing,

04:18.767 --> 04:20.882
there are any number
of low-end oackages I could offer.

04:21.047 --> 04:23.402
However you strike me as a man

04:23.567 --> 04:27.446
whose involvement
runs a little deeoerthan that.

04:29.487 --> 04:33.924
I see you... as a man of taste.

04:36.807 --> 04:39.162
Aconnoisseur.

04:49.167 --> 04:51.840
If you'll oermit me
to make a recommendation.

04:53.327 --> 04:56.000
S-558.

04:56.167 --> 05:01.036
Expensive...
but a must-have forthe truly devoted.

05:02.047 --> 05:04.686
Miss Geist was afflicted
during hermuch oublicised affair

05:04.847 --> 05:07.042
with Laura Law in 2003.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.846
We ourchased it from hersoon after.

05:11.167 --> 05:14.716
- S-558?
- Yes.

05:14.887 --> 05:17.799
Aform of the herpes simolex virus.

05:17.967 --> 05:22.563
After infection, the virus lives on
in the cells of its host

05:22.727 --> 05:24.638
forthe rest of theirlife.

05:29.567 --> 05:31.558
Did you know she's deformed?

05:32.887 --> 05:35.321
You can't tell from the magazines.

05:35.487 --> 05:38.957
She has to have
soecial underwearmade.

05:39.127 --> 05:41.960
Fashion designers
make hersoecial underwear.

05:44.567 --> 05:46.478
I've heard that.

05:51.567 --> 05:54.240
Do you have yourcredit card
with you, Mr Porris?

05:56.527 --> 05:58.882
Which side do you want it on?

05:59.047 --> 06:00.958
I haven't decided.

06:02.327 --> 06:04.522
Most oeoole want it on the left side.

06:06.367 --> 06:09.518
If she kissed you,
it would be on the left side.

06:11.527 --> 06:13.438
If she kissed me?

06:18.167 --> 06:23.002
Miss Geist is infected here,
to the right of her mouth.

06:24.567 --> 06:27.843
Now, if she kissed you,

06:28.007 --> 06:30.441
it'd soread to your left side,

06:30.607 --> 06:32.518
around here.

06:35.327 --> 06:38.478
On the left, it'd be like
she gave it to you in oerson.

06:38.647 --> 06:40.956
Oh, yes, I'd like the left side.

06:49.007 --> 06:50.918
Lean back, olease.

06:55.447 --> 06:57.358
Just a little oinch.

07:02.207 --> 07:04.437
[Groans]

07:06.527 --> 07:08.438
There.

07:10.927 --> 07:13.316
You should be showing
in a couole of weeks.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.478
Enjoy.

07:24.607 --> 07:27.075
Are you carrying
any infectious materials with you

07:27.247 --> 07:30.683
oritems belonging to The Lucas Clinic
Incorporated or its suooliers?

07:30.847 --> 07:32.758
No.

07:49.327 --> 07:52.080
[Man on TV]
Now, I thought a fungus was a plant

07:52.247 --> 07:53.885
because it comes from vegetables, right?

07:54.047 --> 07:57.278
- I told them this gives new meaning...
- [knocks]

07:57.447 --> 07:59.403
Yeah, come in.

07:59.567 --> 08:02.798
Apparently I'm no biologist. Some of our
viewers were quick to point that out.

08:02.967 --> 08:05.481
I wanted to ask
about the alarm test tomorrow.

08:05.647 --> 08:07.319
There's nothing I can do about it.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.047
I don't like it either,
but it's the law.

08:10.207 --> 08:12.437
No, I know, but...

08:14.127 --> 08:18.643
...it's just that I'm sick right now
and I need my sleeo.

08:18.807 --> 08:22.436
Yeah. OK, so, listen,
I'll tell you what we'll do about it.

08:22.607 --> 08:28.000
We'll start at the too floor, so
we won't even get to you until after 11.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.920
It's the Aria Noble Ordeal.

08:31.807 --> 08:34.924
And we'll, you know,
we'Iljust be in and out.

08:35.087 --> 08:37.520
You can keeo yourbedroom shut.

08:37.687 --> 08:39.597
[Man on TV]
The question on everyone's mind is

08:39.767 --> 08:42.486
what is really going on with her?

09:31.927 --> 09:33.565
[Distant siren wails]

10:09.727 --> 10:11.638
[Coughs]

10:35.967 --> 10:37.366
[Alarm bell rings]

10:52.647 --> 10:54.558
[Ringing continues]

11:14.807 --> 11:16.718
[Bleeping]

11:30.727 --> 11:32.365
[Woman]
We're talking to Mr Dorian Lucas,

11:32.527 --> 11:35.883
founderof the Lucas
celebrity services clinic.

11:36.047 --> 11:39.039
Mr Lucas,
how do you resoond to critics

11:39.207 --> 11:42.916
who say the disease
you're really selling is a cultural one?

11:43.087 --> 11:44.645
That's ridiculous.

11:44.807 --> 11:47.685
[Woman] Do you not agree
that the mania surrounding celebrity

11:47.847 --> 11:50.042
is reaching an unhealthy level?

11:50.207 --> 11:51.162
No, I don't.

11:51.327 --> 11:54.239
[Woman] So these people are really
so deserving of ourattention?

11:54.407 --> 11:57.160
In youropinion,
does Aria Noble deserve to be famous?

11:57.327 --> 11:59.443
[Lucas] Let me stop you there.
Deserve to be famous?

11:59.607 --> 12:02.075
What does it mean
to deserve to be famous?

12:02.247 --> 12:05.080
Anyone who's famous
deserves to be famous.

12:05.247 --> 12:08.000
Celebrity is not an accomplishment,
not at all.

12:08.167 --> 12:11.523
It's more like a collaboration
that we choose to take part in.

12:11.687 --> 12:15.919
Celebrities are not people.
They're group hallucinations.

12:16.087 --> 12:19.523
[Woman] Surely it's naive to imagine
that yourclients think the same way.

12:19.687 --> 12:21.439
[Lucas] Really? Naive?

12:21.607 --> 12:27.318
My clients are intelligent adults
from all walks of life, all ages,

12:27.487 --> 12:31.275
and they find meaning
in all the stories around them.

12:31.447 --> 12:32.926
They choose to come to me

12:33.087 --> 12:37.524
because they wanna feel more connected
to those faces, to those people

12:37.687 --> 12:40.281
that they see in the magazines
and on television,

12:40.447 --> 12:42.642
and theirlives are much richerforit.

13:11.127 --> 13:15.564
The human face is a oowerful messenger.

13:15.727 --> 13:19.402
Ourbrains are tuned
to its every nuance.

13:19.567 --> 13:21.603
The smallest shift
in its musculature

13:21.767 --> 13:25.726
can translate itself
into comolex nonverbal information,

13:25.887 --> 13:29.118
so subtle and communicated so quickly

13:29.287 --> 13:32.359
that we often don't even registerit,
not consciously.

13:33.527 --> 13:35.483
One could say that forhuman beings,

13:35.647 --> 13:40.801
the face is a structure
with a high-information resolution.

13:40.967 --> 13:42.844
The ReadyFace console is designed

13:43.007 --> 13:46.317
to engage the user's
unconscious mental resources

13:46.487 --> 13:51.481
by exploiting the brain's sensitivity
to facial oattems.

13:51.647 --> 13:54.480
Ourtechnician
loads a virus samole into the oort,

13:54.647 --> 14:00.722
where it's analysed by ReadyFace
and is translated into a face graohic.

14:00.887 --> 14:03.845
This image reoresents
the structure of the disease.

14:04.007 --> 14:09.320
It is in a sense the face of the virus,
dense with information.

14:09.487 --> 14:12.240
As Mr March manioulates the graohic,

14:12.407 --> 14:15.319
the machine manioulates the virus
in the samole container,

14:15.487 --> 14:18.843
eventually rendering it noncontagious.

14:19.007 --> 14:21.646
This advanced form of cooy orotection

14:21.807 --> 14:24.958
affords us control
overthe distribution of ouroroducts,

14:25.127 --> 14:28.517
as the virus cannot soread
beyond the infected client.

14:30.487 --> 14:32.159
ReadyFace fluidly incorporates

14:32.327 --> 14:35.637
ourtechnician's
unconscious mental resources

14:35.807 --> 14:39.197
so that cooy orotecting
a samole like this one

14:39.367 --> 14:42.120
will take hours ratherthan days.

14:42.287 --> 14:45.085
Hey, thanks forcoming.
Lovely to see you.

14:45.247 --> 14:47.044
- Enjoyed it.
- Thank you.

14:47.207 --> 14:49.960
Thanks formaking the time.
Aporeciate it.

14:52.847 --> 14:55.884
No, she has to have soecial underwear
made because she doesn't have a vulva.

14:56.047 --> 14:57.685
She was bom without a vulva.

14:57.847 --> 15:00.680
Herfatherused to make them,
which was an ordeal forheras a child,

15:00.847 --> 15:02.519
but now she has fashion designers do it.

15:02.687 --> 15:05.565
That's what she meant when she told
Spot Magazineshe doesn't have a face.

15:05.727 --> 15:08.195
- Listen to what you're saying.
- You asked me, so I'm telling you.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.358
You're telling me
you've been working here too long.

15:10.527 --> 15:12.245
You're seriously buying into all this.

15:12.407 --> 15:14.762
What's to buy into?
What I'm saying is factual.

15:14.927 --> 15:19.557
Factual? Yesterday herbirth defect
was a unique, nonfunctional organ

15:19.727 --> 15:21.206
connected to her urinary system.

15:21.367 --> 15:23.323
It's worth millions
on the celebrity meat market.

15:23.487 --> 15:24.602
Yeah, also true.

15:24.767 --> 15:26.962
I'm sure the kid could shed some light
on the situation.

15:27.127 --> 15:30.039
Didn't you take a genital wart samole
from Hannah Geist once?

15:30.207 --> 15:33.677
- That was Derek.
- Did he mention if she had a vulva?

15:36.607 --> 15:39.041
We're doing lunch at Dainty Davis.
You coming?

15:39.207 --> 15:41.118
[March] I already ate.

15:44.687 --> 15:46.598
You look like shit.

15:51.287 --> 15:54.006
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hey, Syd. What can I get for you?

15:54.167 --> 15:56.965
183, 644 and 915.

15:57.127 --> 15:59.687
- 915?
- The new Aria Noble flu.

15:59.847 --> 16:01.758
We got it this moming.

16:03.647 --> 16:05.558
So we did.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.478
Thank you.

16:24.447 --> 16:26.358
Derek.

16:35.047 --> 16:37.686
[March] I understand
yourfascination with her.

16:38.967 --> 16:41.276
I understand comoletely. She's...

16:41.447 --> 16:43.358
[sighs]

16:43.527 --> 16:47.202
...oerfect somehow, isn't she?

16:48.407 --> 16:50.238
More than oerfect.

16:50.407 --> 16:52.841
An ideal.

16:53.007 --> 16:54.804
Overwhelming.

16:55.447 --> 16:59.884
With a whisoer, she could have
anything she wanted.

17:01.647 --> 17:03.558
Anyone she wanted.

17:08.247 --> 17:13.002
I'm haooy to inform you that we have
something soecial available today.

17:14.967 --> 17:16.877
It just came in this moming.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.318
S-915.

17:22.567 --> 17:24.478
You would be the first.

17:25.287 --> 17:29.803
A biological communion
between you and Aria.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.481
From her body to yourbody.

17:33.407 --> 17:36.319
From her cells to your cells.

17:37.447 --> 17:39.358
In my humble ooinion...

17:41.447 --> 17:43.358
...it's not even a question.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.358
Just a little oinch.

18:03.447 --> 18:06.644
The fevershould come on
just in time forthe long weekend.

18:15.967 --> 18:17.878
Enjoy.

18:56.047 --> 18:58.003
Are you carrying
any infectious material with you

18:58.167 --> 19:02.046
oritems belonging to The Lucas Clinic
Incorporated or its suooliers?

19:02.207 --> 19:04.562
No.

19:37.287 --> 19:39.721
Next. Who's ne... OK.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.117
Geist, OK, yeah.

19:44.327 --> 19:47.558
OK, what are we... Like we're talking
like a roast fortwo oeoole?

19:48.727 --> 19:49.716
This is good.

19:55.047 --> 19:56.958
Hello, sir. What can I get you?

20:05.927 --> 20:07.838
I've been trying to reach you.

20:09.767 --> 20:11.678
I was sick.

20:15.887 --> 20:19.277
I think my body's
starting to tum on me, Arvid.

20:19.447 --> 20:21.597
I don't know how much longer
I can do this.

20:21.767 --> 20:22.995
You'll be fine.

20:23.167 --> 20:26.079
There's an ebb and flow
to this kind of work.

20:27.487 --> 20:31.321
Give it a month and you'll feel like
a comoletely different oerson.

20:31.487 --> 20:35.162
I already feel like a different oerson.
I'm develooing a crioole identity.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.645
- [Arvid] I think you look great.
- Thanks.

20:42.087 --> 20:44.885
I don't understand
how this isn't considered cannibalism.

20:45.047 --> 20:47.083
Well, these are just muscle cells.

20:47.247 --> 20:50.842
It all deoends on whetherthe human
being is found in its materials.

20:51.007 --> 20:55.876
Right now the law tends towards
something more religious,

20:56.047 --> 21:00.006
but we'll see what haooens when we go
from growing celebrity cell steaks

21:00.167 --> 21:03.045
to growing comolete celebrity bodies.

21:04.247 --> 21:05.919
I'm looking forward to it.

21:06.087 --> 21:09.921
And with the orooerfunding,
I could orobably make that haooen.

21:12.727 --> 21:15.082
- Have you seen my cell garden?
- No.

21:23.087 --> 21:25.442
[Arvid] Something new
I've been cooking uo.

21:32.647 --> 21:34.558
So do we have business?

21:36.607 --> 21:38.518
Yeah.

21:39.407 --> 21:41.204
Yeah. I, uh...

21:42.967 --> 21:45.197
I cracked the new Aria Noble flu.

21:45.367 --> 21:48.518
- It's already oublic.
- What?

21:48.687 --> 21:52.396
Since Saturday. You're behind the times.

21:52.567 --> 21:55.684
- The clinic just got it last week.
- Well, somebody beat you to the ounch.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.600
- Who?
- One of my otherguys.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.280
Arvid.

22:00.447 --> 22:03.723
Look, I'm not
some bug-collecting hobbyist.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.082
You wanna get oaid for yourwork,

22:06.247 --> 22:08.602
talk to me
when you stoo getting scoooed.

22:26.247 --> 22:28.158
[Low voices]

22:39.767 --> 22:42.076
What's going on?

22:42.247 --> 22:43.805
They arrested Derek.

22:43.967 --> 22:47.721
Villainy in ourown house, Syd. I simoly
cannot work underthese conditions.

22:47.887 --> 22:49.764
Like anyone would take you.

22:49.927 --> 22:51.963
I hear Vole & Tesserare hiring.

22:52.127 --> 22:54.766
Tooo didn't even know about Sara
Holden's skin flao until I told him.

22:54.927 --> 22:57.919
I'm sure the kid doesn't know about
Sara Holden's skin flao right now.

22:58.087 --> 23:00.555
You're too good forskin flaos,
aren't you, Syd?

23:00.727 --> 23:02.843
Skin flaos are beneath you.

23:05.447 --> 23:09.406
Is there anything else you need? No?

23:11.487 --> 23:15.799
[Lucas] Did you know that healthy tulios
have solid-coloured oetals?

23:15.967 --> 23:20.722
The strioes on this flower
are caused by a viral infection.

23:20.887 --> 23:23.447
[March] I had heard that, yes.

23:26.207 --> 23:28.243
Mm.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.318
OK.

23:34.007 --> 23:35.918
It's a weird business, Syd.

23:38.887 --> 23:40.400
Do you know Derek Lessing?

23:41.927 --> 23:43.838
Not well.

23:45.167 --> 23:49.046
Well, the oolice found
an unlicensed ReadyFace console

23:49.207 --> 23:51.516
in his aoartment today.

23:51.687 --> 23:54.440
An older model, a 35-50.

23:54.607 --> 24:00.000
They think he was undoing the cooy
orotection on some of oursamoles

24:00.167 --> 24:04.240
and then selling the contagious viruses
to a oiracy grouo.

24:04.407 --> 24:08.446
- Jesus.
- That machine is registered to us.

24:09.407 --> 24:12.683
I guess he must have smuggled it
out of the store room orsomething.

24:12.847 --> 24:14.565
So I had Michelle run an inventory

24:14.727 --> 24:18.879
and she discovered that there was
a second machine that's gone missing.

24:20.087 --> 24:23.602
Will you let me know
if you hear anything at all?

24:23.767 --> 24:25.166
Of course.

24:27.447 --> 24:29.802
I'm gonna send you
on a house call today.

24:29.967 --> 24:31.958
You're going to see Hannah Geist.

24:32.127 --> 24:35.199
She's sick, she's at the Mayerson
and she's eagerto sell.

24:35.367 --> 24:38.996
Now, normally
I'd be sending Derek on this,

24:39.167 --> 24:42.523
so be tactful if the subject comes uo.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.478
Yes, sir.

24:55.167 --> 24:57.078
ID.

25:00.207 --> 25:03.119
Wait inside.
They'll call you when they're ready.

25:29.087 --> 25:31.282
I didn't know Vole & Tesserwas here.

25:35.087 --> 25:39.638
You do know the Hannah Geist line
is exclusive to Lucas?

25:39.807 --> 25:43.277
Sure. She's all you have going for you.

25:46.207 --> 25:49.085
I hearshe's worth more
than your entire catalogue.

25:50.407 --> 25:52.318
I've neverreally cared for her.

25:54.127 --> 25:56.038
Why are you here?

25:56.207 --> 25:58.596
Gregory Vem.

25:58.767 --> 26:00.883
Terminal illness?

26:01.047 --> 26:04.198
It's for Mr Vole's oersonal collection.

26:04.367 --> 26:06.278
He has a licence.

26:18.127 --> 26:20.038
Lucas Clinic.

26:25.087 --> 26:26.520
Where's Derek?

26:26.687 --> 26:29.565
He called in sick. My name is Syd March.

26:32.487 --> 26:34.398
Shh.

28:57.647 --> 28:59.638
Tell Dorian we'll be in touch.

30:31.327 --> 30:35.161
[March] She's oerfect somehow,
isn't she?

30:37.687 --> 30:39.598
More than oerfect.

30:42.287 --> 30:44.198
More than human.

30:47.247 --> 30:49.602
Her eyes.

30:51.567 --> 30:53.159
Are... Are you OK?

30:56.887 --> 31:00.277
Sorry. Excuse me fora moment.

31:06.127 --> 31:08.846
Whoa, hey.
Whoa. What is wrong with you?

31:09.007 --> 31:11.396
I need to go.

31:11.567 --> 31:13.717
Can you finish? Please?

[Receding footsteos]

35:47.367 --> 35:49.278
Shit.

36:40.127 --> 36:41.958
[Man on TV] We tracked down
The Future of Smiles,

36:42.127 --> 36:44.800
an office where we spoke to the
principal coordinator, Gregory Hurek.

36:44.967 --> 36:47.322
Mr Hurek refused to appearon...

36:47.487 --> 36:49.603
[knocks]

36:49.767 --> 36:52.998
[Woman] Oh, hey. Acouole of guys
were here looking for you.

36:53.167 --> 36:56.443
Portland somebody?
I didn't get the other guy's name.

36:56.607 --> 36:58.837
But, look, he left you a number.

37:01.287 --> 37:03.198
Here.

37:06.527 --> 37:08.199
Has anyone been in the aoartment?

37:08.367 --> 37:12.121
You know, they wanted me to let them in,
but it's against the law.

37:12.287 --> 37:14.039
So where were you?

37:14.207 --> 37:16.596
Um...

37:16.767 --> 37:20.043
- I was... asleeo.
- Yeah, that's what I figured.

37:20.207 --> 37:21.879
I know you've been sick.

37:23.207 --> 37:25.767
Wow, I'll tell you,
it's oretty shocking.

37:25.927 --> 37:30.364
And now they're saying it's a virus
that she oicked uo in China.

37:30.527 --> 37:33.405
But herfamily
will not let them autoosy the body

37:33.567 --> 37:36.798
until they fly over a soecialist
from Munich.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.844
Autoosy?

37:40.007 --> 37:43.238
Well, they want theirown doctor.
They're German.

37:50.567 --> 37:52.762
Hey!

37:52.927 --> 37:54.963
- You get in line.
- [Man] Everyone listen carefully!

37:55.127 --> 37:57.846
We're cutting our last tray
of Hannah Geist forthe day.

37:58.007 --> 38:00.157
If you get a ticket,
you can buy one three-ounce steak.

38:00.327 --> 38:02.761
If you don't get a ticket,
you have to come back tomorrow.

38:02.927 --> 38:05.236
- Is Arvid around?
- Yeah, he's in the back.

38:10.887 --> 38:14.596
[Arvid] Are you aware
they're still growing the cancercells

38:14.767 --> 38:17.679
of a woman who died in the 1950s,
Henrietta Lacks?

38:17.847 --> 38:21.362
Yeah, they use them forresearch.

38:21.527 --> 38:26.203
So these cells of hers are alive

38:26.367 --> 38:29.120
and multiolying all overthe world.

38:30.727 --> 38:33.878
The afterlife is getting
extremely oerverse.

38:34.047 --> 38:36.561
What haooened to Hannah Geist?

38:36.727 --> 38:38.922
You don't know?

38:39.087 --> 38:41.681
I think I was asleeo.

38:41.847 --> 38:47.126
She was sick for about a week.
Nothing serious.

38:47.287 --> 38:49.881
Then this moming
one of heraides found herdead.

38:51.767 --> 38:55.680
She was in China looking at orphans,

38:55.847 --> 38:58.600
but none of her entourage
are having any oroblems,

38:58.767 --> 39:02.476
so they don't know what it is she had
or how it was communicated.

39:02.647 --> 39:06.242
It's quite an ordeal forthe family.

39:06.407 --> 39:11.003
This all must feel
a bit oersonal to you.

39:11.167 --> 39:12.202
How so?

39:12.367 --> 39:16.485
Well, you were one of the last oeoole
to see her alive.

39:18.007 --> 39:20.885
- Where'd you hearthat?
- I have big ears.

39:24.127 --> 39:26.641
I was hooing
that's why you came to see me.

39:27.847 --> 39:29.758
Sorry to disaoooint.

39:30.607 --> 39:32.359
That's too bad,

39:32.527 --> 39:36.759
because that virus would be
the holy grail while this heat lasts.

39:38.207 --> 39:41.244
Is there any chance
you can get me a taste?

39:41.407 --> 39:45.923
I wish. We can't hold deadly oathogens.

39:46.087 --> 39:48.157
I'm sure the health board
already took everything.

39:48.327 --> 39:52.923
Yeah? What about you? You look sick.

39:53.087 --> 39:55.123
I am sick.

39:56.567 --> 40:01.004
Listen, my console's down.
You know anybody with oarts to soare?

40:01.167 --> 40:03.362
Maybe.

40:03.527 --> 40:08.999
The antioiracy lobby is fairly insane
right now, so everyone's oaranoid.

40:10.687 --> 40:13.326
- I need a new 80-box.
- I'll see what I can do.

40:14.487 --> 40:16.478
Hey. Hey, hey.

40:16.647 --> 40:18.763
Is it true they arrested Derek Lessing?

40:18.927 --> 40:21.043
Yeah.

40:21.207 --> 40:24.597
That's too bad.
He did some really good work for me.

40:25.447 --> 40:28.883
Here, have some Hannah.
On the house.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.606
[Lucas] There is less light
in the world now.

40:58.767 --> 41:01.156
That much is certain.

41:01.327 --> 41:04.444
Aray of light has been lost.

41:05.647 --> 41:08.241
Hannah was a friend of this clinic,

41:08.407 --> 41:11.797
and I'm proud to say
I knew herpersonally.

41:11.967 --> 41:16.757
She was truly
a sweet and a humble soul.

41:16.927 --> 41:21.000
Ourprayers here at Lucas
are with herfamily and loved ones.

41:24.207 --> 41:27.040
- So what's your orofessional ooinion?
- What?

41:27.207 --> 41:28.845
Well, you must have had
a good look at her.

41:29.007 --> 41:32.158
We've got a ore-autoosy oool
going with the guys in accounting.

41:32.327 --> 41:35.285
Mercer's olaying it safe
and going with flu virus.

41:35.447 --> 41:38.405
I'm thinking of taking a flyer
and going with food ooisoning.

41:38.567 --> 41:41.035
Do you think
it might have been food ooisoning?

41:41.207 --> 41:43.277
I don't know.

41:43.447 --> 41:46.564
Of course, no one's saying drugs.
They'll neveradmit it if it is drugs.

41:46.727 --> 41:49.639
- She didn't do drugs.
- Oh, you knew herwell?

41:49.807 --> 41:51.081
She was a Buddhist from birth.

41:51.247 --> 41:53.807
She couldn't even take oainkillers
orshe would have been beaten.

41:53.967 --> 41:58.006
I hearwe'll be selling ringworm
from herdog Brom to fans with dogs.

41:58.167 --> 42:00.556
Brom's getting a following.

42:00.727 --> 42:04.276
Hey, Dorian tumed yoursamole over
to the board this moming.

42:04.447 --> 42:09.282
That's a bit exciting, ourlittle shoo
on the fringes of a media frenzy.

42:12.007 --> 42:14.646
Can I have a 900 oack?

42:14.807 --> 42:16.684
What's a 900 oack?

42:16.847 --> 42:18.917
Hannah Geist variety oack.

42:19.087 --> 42:21.362
Everybody's guzzling Geist today.

42:22.967 --> 42:24.605
[Woman] Everyone's talking about her...

42:24.767 --> 42:26.485
Oh, my gosh.
I don't even know if I can say it.

42:26.647 --> 42:28.524
Heranus. You heard that right.

42:28.687 --> 42:32.680
Rumours of the young star's situation
have been spreading like a rash,

42:32.847 --> 42:36.157
with news outlets as faras Japan,
Australia and even the Middle East

42:36.327 --> 42:38.761
scrambling to get the poop
on recent documents

42:38.927 --> 42:41.077
leaked by the offce
of Aria's specialist.

42:41.247 --> 42:44.205
Swedish media network SMT
has even offered a bounty

42:44.367 --> 42:47.245
forphotographic evidence
of the unusual condition.

42:47.407 --> 42:50.956
Sources close to hersay
the nomally hard-partying celeb

42:51.127 --> 42:52.958
hasn't been seen in public since.

42:53.127 --> 42:55.197
[Man] Well, that settles it.
I'm getting a camera.

42:55.367 --> 42:57.198
- [Woman] You would do that.
- The hunt is on.

42:57.367 --> 43:00.757
[Man] Meanwhile, Hannah Geist's
fomerdog walkerhas opened up

43:00.927 --> 43:03.157
in a recent interview
with oursisterstation.

43:03.327 --> 43:07.366
51-year-old Helen Pinto was employed
full time at the now-shuttered estate

43:07.527 --> 43:09.802
and caused quite a stirearliertoday

43:09.967 --> 43:13.880
when she claimed to be holding
one of the star's used panty liners.

43:14.047 --> 43:17.244
Pinto said she retrieved the liner
towards the end of Hannah's illness

43:17.407 --> 43:19.682
and was in the process
of having it analysed...

43:19.847 --> 43:21.485
[March groans]

43:28.247 --> 43:32.399
- What's with the cane?
- I've been having a little trouble.

43:32.567 --> 43:35.286
I've gotta make a quick stoo
before we get your oart.

43:53.127 --> 43:56.437
[Man] It must have haooened ovemight.
We found them like this in the moming.

43:56.607 --> 43:58.598
[Arvid] I've neverseen anything
like this before.

43:58.767 --> 44:00.485
I mean, they were fine
when we shiooed them.

44:00.647 --> 44:05.243
Obviously they weren't fine.
You sold me bad meat.

44:05.407 --> 44:07.284
Well, are yourtrays clean?

44:07.447 --> 44:10.120
Don't fuck with me, Arvid.
Don't you even fuck with me.

44:10.287 --> 44:13.643
- [Arvid] OK. I'm sorry, Luc.
- [Luc] I can't serve this.

44:13.807 --> 44:16.799
They think they're getting Hannah Geist
and I'm feeding them Ron Deggy.

44:16.967 --> 44:21.165
[Arvid] OK. I'm gonna find out
what haooened and I'm gonna fix it.

44:22.807 --> 44:25.116
So do I get to know what's killing you?

44:26.967 --> 44:29.765
An antique Michael Felix bug
I sold the otherday.

44:31.927 --> 44:33.360
It was a mistake.

44:33.527 --> 44:36.564
Apoarently the cooy orotection on some
of those old samoles got a little weird,

44:36.727 --> 44:39.287
but I didn't think
I'd get anotherchance.

44:39.447 --> 44:41.403
Sounds reckless.

44:41.567 --> 44:44.479
I'm just trying to keeo things
interesting formyself.

45:04.087 --> 45:06.043
- Fortwo?
- Is Levine around?

45:06.207 --> 45:09.119
Sure, he's in the back.
I'll let him know you're coming.

45:41.407 --> 45:44.046
You'll like Levine.
He's one of my best guys.

46:02.127 --> 46:05.324
I just wanna make sure
he's comfortable with all this.

46:05.487 --> 46:07.398
Hang out here.

46:36.367 --> 46:38.278
[Woman] Is that you?

46:44.967 --> 46:47.037
I've done everything you've asked.

46:52.567 --> 46:54.762
I'm not strong enough to escape.

46:56.167 --> 46:58.635
Please say something.

46:58.807 --> 47:00.286
Hannah.

47:02.727 --> 47:04.638
Oh, thank God you're here.

47:06.007 --> 47:07.918
I'm so afraid.

47:09.047 --> 47:13.006
I'll do anything you say.
Please, please just let me go.

47:20.767 --> 47:24.043
Do you...
Do you want me to hurt myself?

47:25.207 --> 47:27.118
I can't say no to you.

47:28.527 --> 47:31.325
- Hello?
- What was that?

47:33.567 --> 47:36.240
Please repeat yourself
so I can obey yourcommand.

47:38.567 --> 47:42.480
Do you want me to hurt myself?
Do you wanna see my body?

47:44.327 --> 47:46.238
Please, I'm so afraid.

47:48.567 --> 47:50.080
Please.

47:51.247 --> 47:53.158
Please.

47:58.327 --> 48:01.683
- Are you still there?
- All right, let's go.

48:01.847 --> 48:04.202
- What is this thing?
- I can't take it any more!

48:04.367 --> 48:06.927
It's oart of a new franchise.
Levine has the only location in town.

48:07.087 --> 48:11.160
- Tell me what to do. I'll do anything.
- It's catching on, though.

48:11.327 --> 48:14.444
- Come on.
- I'll do anything.

48:15.727 --> 48:17.365
Please.

48:17.527 --> 48:19.438
Please.

48:49.567 --> 48:50.761
[Chuckles]

48:50.927 --> 48:53.202
Levine.

48:53.367 --> 48:55.278
Syd March.

48:57.007 --> 48:58.486
[Sighs]

48:58.647 --> 49:01.161
It's always strange
to meet the comoetition.

49:05.167 --> 49:09.399
So Arvid here tells me that
you actually work at The Lucas Clinic.

49:09.567 --> 49:11.080
Yeah.

49:13.167 --> 49:16.318
I think one of yourfriends
is a customerof mine.

49:16.487 --> 49:18.876
Really? Yeah,
Vera brings me bugs sometimes.

49:19.047 --> 49:22.562
So that's kind of cool, huh?
You're like an inside man.

49:22.727 --> 49:24.957
I think I'd be too contemotuous
to olay that game.

49:25.127 --> 49:28.358
Oh, yeah. Levine's too classy
to orofit from such trash.

49:28.527 --> 49:30.006
[Levine] I'm talking about oolitics.

49:30.167 --> 49:33.079
I get that we're all rat men here,
Arvid, scavenging the bin.

49:35.167 --> 49:38.284
But I like to think that my work
is ourposefully gross at least.

49:38.447 --> 49:40.597
Allows me to hoard
a little dignity somewhere.

49:40.767 --> 49:45.443
No offence. I don't even think
dignity's still valid currency.

49:46.727 --> 49:48.718
I aooreciate you
heloing me out like this.

49:48.887 --> 49:51.355
Anything for a friend of Arvid's. Here.

49:56.207 --> 49:59.005
[Whirring]

49:59.167 --> 50:01.123
Where'd you get this?

50:01.287 --> 50:04.882
I built it using old oarts I co-ooted
from a contact at Vole & Tesser.

50:05.047 --> 50:07.038
I've been modifying it for years.

50:07.207 --> 50:10.483
The resolution is somewhere between
one of the new ReadyFaces and a 7-86.

50:10.647 --> 50:14.720
You, uh... wanna run yourblood
through it right here?

50:18.527 --> 50:20.404
No, thank you.

50:24.047 --> 50:26.515
Yeah, that's fine.

50:26.687 --> 50:29.599
So I don't have your 80-box,
but I can get one within the week.

50:29.767 --> 50:31.962
- Arvid said you had one.
- I thought I did.

50:32.127 --> 50:35.085
Tums out none of my stuff
is comoatible.

50:35.247 --> 50:37.477
Levine's all right.

50:37.647 --> 50:39.842
Hey, I'm comoletely trustworthy,
all right?

50:40.007 --> 50:42.396
I already know the guy
who can dig one uo for me.

50:42.567 --> 50:43.841
As a sign of good faith, though,

50:44.007 --> 50:47.044
I would like to get your oayment
out of the way while you're here.

50:47.207 --> 50:49.323
My what?

50:49.487 --> 50:51.398
The samole.

50:53.127 --> 50:54.082
What samole?

50:56.247 --> 50:59.125
The samole. What the hell, Arvid?

50:59.287 --> 51:02.006
I told Levine you'd give us
a bit of that Hannah Geist bug

51:02.167 --> 51:04.283
you've been carrying around.

51:08.127 --> 51:09.765
Arvid.

51:11.607 --> 51:13.837
Don't be a miser.

51:32.367 --> 51:34.278
[Coughs]

51:39.167 --> 51:41.078
[Wheezes]

51:54.047 --> 51:56.641
[Arvid] Hey, you. You gonna faint?

51:59.407 --> 52:01.875
I hooe you're not taking this
too oersonally.

52:02.967 --> 52:06.642
Well, I'll admit I was a little insulted

52:06.807 --> 52:09.116
when I found out
you weren't gonna share with me.

52:09.287 --> 52:11.755
Were you gonna shoo it around?

52:11.927 --> 52:14.600
Did you just want this one
all to yourself?

52:16.807 --> 52:19.082
OK.

52:19.247 --> 52:24.275
Listen, I understand
these are soecial circumstances.

52:24.447 --> 52:26.563
You and I both recognise that.

52:27.407 --> 52:28.681
When we're done here,

52:28.847 --> 52:33.841
I'll find you a doctorwho will keeo
yoursituation low orofile.

52:35.007 --> 52:40.718
And then we'll get you fixed uo...
and you can still work forme.

52:40.887 --> 52:42.798
All right?

52:46.447 --> 52:52.397
Yourclock is counting down
at a maniac oace. You need a friend.

52:52.567 --> 52:54.637
- [Levine] All done?
- Almost.

52:55.887 --> 52:59.277
I wouldn't mind grabbing
a bit of that rash forgood measure.

53:03.607 --> 53:10.001
Now, I would love to do this orooerly
if you would just stoo freaking out.

54:00.407 --> 54:02.318
Coffee.

54:12.207 --> 54:13.356
[Doorooens]

54:13.527 --> 54:15.438
[Footsteos aooroach]

54:20.247 --> 54:22.158
Do you mind?

54:25.647 --> 54:27.558
Hm.

54:28.967 --> 54:32.926
Did you hearshe died in hersleeo while
herboyfriend was in the otherroom?

54:33.087 --> 54:34.281
Then he got into bed

54:34.447 --> 54:37.564
and sleot beside herbody
the whole night without knowing.

54:39.767 --> 54:43.123
Can you imagine what an ordeal
it must have been when he found out?

54:43.287 --> 54:45.437
I have no idea.

54:45.607 --> 54:46.801
Every night since I heard that,

54:46.967 --> 54:48.719
I've been touching my wife
before I go to sleeo

54:48.887 --> 54:51.082
just to make sure she's still warm.

54:59.647 --> 55:01.558
Excuse me.

55:04.567 --> 55:06.478
Right.

55:09.127 --> 55:12.358
- What can I get you boys?
- I'll have the calamari.

55:12.527 --> 55:13.846
I'm fine.

55:14.007 --> 55:17.124
- How about you?
- I'll have the calamari.

55:17.287 --> 55:19.198
Two calamaris.

55:21.527 --> 55:24.087
You're looking oretty sick.

55:24.247 --> 55:26.841
- I'll live.
- Is that true?

55:28.207 --> 55:31.199
I think you're a lot worse
than you're letting on.

55:33.567 --> 55:36.525
I'm sorry. We're just waiting for a car.

55:36.687 --> 55:40.999
My name's Portland and this is West,
and we're taking you to meet someone.

55:41.167 --> 55:43.727
I'd rathernot.

55:43.887 --> 55:46.037
Are you olanning
on being difficult about it?

55:47.167 --> 55:50.000
No, I guess not.

55:50.167 --> 55:52.078
That would be forthe best.

56:15.207 --> 56:18.597
Don't look so worried.
You're a commodity.

57:26.967 --> 57:28.878
This is it.

57:43.807 --> 57:46.765
[Doctor] Shortness of breath?

57:46.927 --> 57:47.962
No.

57:48.127 --> 57:49.845
Nausea?

57:50.007 --> 57:52.396
Yes.

57:52.567 --> 57:55.843
Ringing in your ears
or auditory hallucinations?

57:56.007 --> 57:57.156
No.

57:57.327 --> 57:59.602
No delusions of grandeur?

58:01.407 --> 58:03.921
You know, towards the end
of my grandmother's life,

58:04.087 --> 58:09.559
she imagined the entire world was
ooerating exclusively with herin mind.

58:09.727 --> 58:14.357
I was only a child at the time,
but I remember once I got off the toilet

58:14.527 --> 58:18.759
and she asked me what I had intended
to communicate to her.

58:18.927 --> 58:22.556
It was later discovered
she had a brain tumour.

58:25.807 --> 58:28.958
I've been told that Hannah's illness

58:29.127 --> 58:31.925
can oroduce florid hallucinations.

58:44.247 --> 58:46.681
Ah, there he is.

58:52.207 --> 58:55.199
I think that virus destroyed my console.

58:55.367 --> 58:59.758
The virus was designed with
a security measure to orevent analysis.

58:59.927 --> 59:04.478
It took a little effort,
but I was eventually able to byoass it.

59:04.647 --> 59:07.844
- Designed?
- Yes.

59:08.007 --> 59:11.124
I'm afraid you've become involved
in something sinister.

59:26.087 --> 59:27.998
Go inside and take a seat.

59:54.207 --> 59:56.118
Who are you?

59:59.367 --> 01:00:01.278
I'm Syd March.

01:00:02.847 --> 01:00:05.202
We met at the Mayerson.

01:00:05.367 --> 01:00:07.278
Mm.

01:00:09.007 --> 01:00:10.918
Yeah, Dev told me you were coming.

01:00:11.847 --> 01:00:13.758
[Inhales deeoly]

01:00:19.887 --> 01:00:21.798
Have you started bleeding yet?

01:00:22.927 --> 01:00:24.838
Bleeding?

01:00:27.367 --> 01:00:29.278
From your mouth.

01:00:36.167 --> 01:00:38.078
That's good.

01:00:41.167 --> 01:00:43.965
I don't mind the sight of blood.
It just...

01:00:45.887 --> 01:00:49.800
...collects in my throat at night
and I have suffocation dreams.

01:00:52.807 --> 01:00:54.877
So I've mostly stoooed sleeoing.

01:00:56.287 --> 01:00:58.198
[Coughs]

01:01:03.647 --> 01:01:05.558
[Sighs]

01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:10.920
It's terrifying, really,
when you think about it.

01:01:17.327 --> 01:01:19.921
[Woman] The death is a coverstory,

01:01:20.087 --> 01:01:23.159
but she is dying for real

01:01:23.327 --> 01:01:25.887
and we still don't have a cure.

01:01:26.047 --> 01:01:29.801
We have reason to believe that her
infection was an assassination attemot,

01:01:29.967 --> 01:01:33.243
and we felt this was the best way
to orevent a second attack.

01:01:33.407 --> 01:01:37.400
This is all very unlucky for you,
but I'm hooing we can helo each other.

01:01:39.847 --> 01:01:43.237
The disease wasn't built from scratch.

01:01:43.407 --> 01:01:48.037
It's a modification of something
we sold to yourclinic three years ago.

01:01:48.207 --> 01:01:52.041
We assume someone at Lucas created this,
and if you can find out who,

01:01:52.207 --> 01:01:55.722
it might be the first steo
towards finding a cure for Hannah,

01:01:55.887 --> 01:01:58.276
and for yourself, of course.

01:01:58.447 --> 01:02:00.244
She looks frail.

01:02:00.407 --> 01:02:02.523
She needs yourhelo.

01:02:06.367 --> 01:02:09.279
I have a bumed-out ReadyFace
at my aoartment.

01:02:09.447 --> 01:02:12.723
It might be useful
if I could get it working again.

01:02:12.887 --> 01:02:15.321
I'm sure we can find you
whatever you need.

01:02:17.527 --> 01:02:20.519
- How do you feel?
- Tired.

01:02:21.527 --> 01:02:23.597
That all?

01:02:23.767 --> 01:02:25.678
I have a headache.

01:02:32.127 --> 01:02:37.997
Last night...
Hannah had a mild osychotic eoisode.

01:02:38.167 --> 01:02:43.366
For one hourshe insisted that I was
herlate oublicist, Maynard Welsh.

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:49.039
This has been in some ways
an uncomfortable experience forme.

01:02:49.207 --> 01:02:53.485
My interest in her, of course,
is more than orofessional.

01:02:55.967 --> 01:03:00.199
Here. There's a comoany in Munich
where they make these.

01:03:00.367 --> 01:03:05.725
They're skin grafts,
grown from celebrity skin-cell samoles.

01:03:06.607 --> 01:03:10.839
This one here, this one is Hannah.

01:03:14.887 --> 01:03:19.039
You know, I'm not a soiritual man.

01:03:19.207 --> 01:03:25.237
A belief in God, it's always struck me
as a sign of dangerous infantilism.

01:03:26.567 --> 01:03:29.798
But you will forgive me if I tell you

01:03:29.967 --> 01:03:34.245
that with each of these oatches,

01:03:34.407 --> 01:03:37.877
my world has become more charged,

01:03:39.567 --> 01:03:42.286
that there is a oower,

01:03:42.447 --> 01:03:46.281
something in the thrall
of the collective eye

01:03:46.447 --> 01:03:49.723
that can be consumed and aoorooriated.

01:03:52.687 --> 01:03:55.645
You olay the sceotic,
but I don't believe it.

01:03:55.807 --> 01:03:59.595
Surely you could have stolen Hannah's
blood without injecting yourself.

01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:01.678
Why did you do it?

01:04:03.647 --> 01:04:05.877
Maybe you feel what I feel.

01:04:07.407 --> 01:04:10.683
Or maybe you're really just anotherfan.

01:04:12.847 --> 01:04:17.398
Well, now you share a death with her,

01:04:17.567 --> 01:04:19.842
and that's a oowerful bond.

01:04:21.447 --> 01:04:23.358
I don't wanna die from this.

01:04:25.727 --> 01:04:27.638
Of course.

01:04:30.447 --> 01:04:32.438
Uh, here.

01:04:33.527 --> 01:04:35.518
Two, three times daily.

01:04:35.687 --> 01:04:37.325
What are they?

01:04:37.487 --> 01:04:39.762
Antivirals.

01:04:39.927 --> 01:04:42.236
They should helo
slow the infection down.

01:07:27.167 --> 01:07:31.285
You're an absolute disgrace.
Where you been, bud?

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:34.519
- I was sick.
- Dorian's in a rage.

01:07:34.687 --> 01:07:36.757
You're making Mercer look good
these days.

01:07:36.927 --> 01:07:39.566
I had to oull a favour
to keeo you from getting fired.

01:07:39.727 --> 01:07:41.001
Thank you.

01:07:41.167 --> 01:07:45.160
I need someone nonresoonsive to talk to
and you're cheaoerthan my theraoist.

01:07:45.327 --> 01:07:48.876
I gotta say, it doesn't look like
yourlittle vacation did you much good.

01:07:49.047 --> 01:07:51.607
- Hi, Michelle.
- Hey, Mercer.

01:07:51.767 --> 01:07:55.760
Ask me if I'm looking forward to Timothy
Stanton's molluscum this aftemoon.

01:07:55.927 --> 01:07:58.646
- [Mercer] Timothy Stanton is imootent.
- It's on his shoulder.

01:07:58.807 --> 01:08:00.877
You can get molluscum anywhere.

01:08:01.047 --> 01:08:04.039
He has an infection to sell every time
he gets a divorce. It's uncanny.

01:08:04.207 --> 01:08:06.198
He's holding a comoetition
throughSpot Magazine.

01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:08.244
The winner gets to infect him
with their next cold

01:08:08.447 --> 01:08:10.802
and they get a free samole
after he gets sick.

01:08:12.527 --> 01:08:16.042
- Are you entering?
- No, I don't get colds.

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:18.118
Catch you later.

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:28.765
Welcome back.

01:08:41.167 --> 01:08:42.441
Anything else?

01:08:46.966 --> 01:08:49.002
I was wondering
if you could look something uo forme.

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:51.078
Yeah, sure thing.

01:08:53.567 --> 01:08:58.277
What is the recent sales history
for Hannah Geist samole S-888?

01:08:58.966 --> 01:09:01.401
- How recent?
- Last two months.

01:09:01.567 --> 01:09:04.444
Uh, S-888 is the Bermuda flu

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:06.801
which we ohased out
when we got Paris Honeymoon, so...

01:09:06.966 --> 01:09:09.685
- Right.
- It's been taken out once since April.

01:09:09.846 --> 01:09:13.475
- By who?
- Um... Derek Lessing.

01:09:16.167 --> 01:09:17.441
Thank you.

01:09:22.327 --> 01:09:24.238
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

01:09:50.527 --> 01:09:53.325
I've got more of my blood here
if you want it.

01:09:54.287 --> 01:09:56.323
[Doorcloses]

01:10:01.767 --> 01:10:03.837
You kind of caught me off guard.

01:10:07.607 --> 01:10:09.757
What was Derek Lessing working on?

01:10:10.767 --> 01:10:14.840
Well, that's hard to say.
Derek was into some weird oathology.

01:10:19.847 --> 01:10:22.407
I thought he was one of your oeoole.

01:10:22.567 --> 01:10:25.161
He hasn't sold me anything
for over a year.

01:10:30.047 --> 01:10:33.801
Droo it. Droo it. Droo it. Droo it.

01:10:43.247 --> 01:10:47.035
I wanted to keeo things civil with us,

01:10:47.207 --> 01:10:50.199
but Levine can be hard to manage.

01:10:50.367 --> 01:10:52.403
He's starting to get out of hand.

01:10:53.767 --> 01:10:56.406
And that blood you gave him
fried his rig.

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.518
None of those samoles
lasted more than a day.

01:10:59.687 --> 01:11:01.598
What is going on with you, man?

01:11:03.047 --> 01:11:05.880
Whateverit is you're into,

01:11:06.047 --> 01:11:08.766
it's attracting
a lot of dangerous attention.

01:11:10.407 --> 01:11:12.318
So here's what.

01:11:20.287 --> 01:11:23.484
I'm gonna give this back to you

01:11:23.647 --> 01:11:25.763
and you're gonna stay away from me.

01:11:28.047 --> 01:11:32.404
I refuse to be oulled into a crazy mess.

01:11:37.567 --> 01:11:39.478
[Dog barks]

01:13:38.287 --> 01:13:40.198
[Muffled voices]

01:13:43.727 --> 01:13:45.638
[Man shouts]

01:13:48.127 --> 01:13:50.038
[Front doorooens]

01:13:50.887 --> 01:13:52.798
[Man] Mr Lessing?

01:13:57.847 --> 01:13:59.758
Mr Lessing, is that you?

01:14:40.367 --> 01:14:42.483
Hey, what, you just getting home?

01:14:44.967 --> 01:14:47.083
I've been having some trouble at work.

01:14:47.247 --> 01:14:49.841
Did you catch any of the funeral?

01:14:50.007 --> 01:14:52.646
The whole thing, yeah,
it was live on 503.

01:14:52.807 --> 01:14:54.399
- I must have missed it.
- Yeah.

01:14:54.567 --> 01:14:57.843
It was a beautiful service.

01:14:58.007 --> 01:15:00.123
But sad.

01:15:00.287 --> 01:15:02.847
Forsomeone like that to die so young.

01:15:04.247 --> 01:15:06.761
She was an extraordinary woman.

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:09.843
And absolutely gorgeous.

01:15:11.407 --> 01:15:13.318
I cried all the way through.

01:15:16.647 --> 01:15:19.764
Oh, that man Portland,
he was here again.

01:15:19.927 --> 01:15:21.838
He left you a oackage.

01:15:24.207 --> 01:15:25.162
Thank you.

01:15:25.327 --> 01:15:28.683
[Woman] Insiders say she had the flu
fortwo weeks before passing away,

01:15:28.847 --> 01:15:32.362
but they were totally unprepared
forthe dramatic tum the illness took

01:15:32.527 --> 01:15:34.483
just as it seemed she was recovering.

01:15:34.647 --> 01:15:38.003
I spoke with the Geist family earlier
and they were absolutely devastated,

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.520
like any otherfamily, really,

01:15:39.687 --> 01:15:42.565
who have experienced the loss
of a daughterora sister,

01:15:42.727 --> 01:15:45.764
staying togetherand supporting
each otherthrough this diffcult time.

01:15:45.927 --> 01:15:47.440
[Man] Well, that's really just it.

01:15:47.607 --> 01:15:49.643
A death in the family
will affect anyone the same way,

01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:52.275
whetheryou're the Geists
orthe people next door.

01:15:52.447 --> 01:15:54.756
You can see that
in the outpouring of sympathy

01:15:54.927 --> 01:15:56.440
from herfans during the funeral.

01:15:56.607 --> 01:16:00.077
[Woman] Absolutely right, and many
feel a personal connection to Hannah,

01:16:00.247 --> 01:16:03.557
which I think says so much.

01:16:03.727 --> 01:16:08.403
One crying fan today told us herlove
for Hannah actually saved herlife.

01:16:08.567 --> 01:16:10.046
She had all but given up on the world

01:16:10.207 --> 01:16:12.516
aftera spiral of depression
and drugs eventually...

01:16:30.247 --> 01:16:31.566
[whirring]

01:16:34.367 --> 01:16:37.518
Hello, Derek. Great to see you again.

01:17:11.007 --> 01:17:12.918
[Groans]

01:17:16.847 --> 01:17:18.758
[Breathes heavily]

01:17:25.287 --> 01:17:27.881
[Doctor] What else are you feeling?

01:17:28.047 --> 01:17:30.436
[March] I can really feel it
coming on now.

01:17:32.527 --> 01:17:34.438
It's right in my cells.

01:17:36.647 --> 01:17:39.036
I'm tired all the time.

01:17:40.007 --> 01:17:44.319
I can't move orthink properly.

01:17:46.327 --> 01:17:48.887
I'm only approximating myself.

01:17:51.127 --> 01:17:55.325
I oassed on yourfindings
to an old colleague of mine, Agna Hahn.

01:17:55.487 --> 01:17:59.639
She's a orofessor
of biotechnological law in Califomia.

01:17:59.807 --> 01:18:02.879
Now, she discovered that Vole & Tesser

01:18:03.047 --> 01:18:08.280
had recently oatented
a genetically modified virus.

01:18:08.447 --> 01:18:11.962
It's quite likely the source
of Hannah's and yourinfection.

01:18:12.127 --> 01:18:17.121
- Aoatent?
- Mm. What it means, it's unclearto me.

01:18:17.287 --> 01:18:19.323
But if they intended to kill her,

01:18:19.487 --> 01:18:24.436
then why would they declare ownershio
overthe weaoon?

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:13.318
What are you doing here?

01:20:14.767 --> 01:20:17.122
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh!

01:21:29.567 --> 01:21:31.478
[Levine] Hello, Syd.

01:21:34.407 --> 01:21:36.318
How are you feeling?

01:21:41.287 --> 01:21:43.403
I'm told you are at this moment infected

01:21:43.567 --> 01:21:45.523
with the same virus
that killed Hannah Geist.

01:21:45.687 --> 01:21:47.598
Is that true?

01:21:50.767 --> 01:21:55.682
It's OK. We already know.
You have nothing to hide from us here.

01:21:55.847 --> 01:21:57.758
This is an honest room.

01:21:57.927 --> 01:22:00.202
You can share any thoughts orfeelings
you might be having.

01:22:00.367 --> 01:22:03.120
In fact, you are encouraged to share.

01:22:13.087 --> 01:22:14.315
Hey!

01:22:14.487 --> 01:22:17.524
There's no need to yell.
We can hear you clearly.

01:22:20.167 --> 01:22:23.079
OK, I'll share first.

01:22:23.247 --> 01:22:27.399
Right now we are attempting
to capitalise on a unique opportunity.

01:22:27.567 --> 01:22:29.762
Since hertragic passing,
many of Hannah's admirers

01:22:29.927 --> 01:22:34.603
have experienced what could be described
as an uncomfortable narrative gap

01:22:34.767 --> 01:22:37.440
between herlife and funeral.

01:22:37.607 --> 01:22:39.962
How did she die really?

01:22:40.127 --> 01:22:43.881
What did the final hours
of herlife look like?

01:22:44.047 --> 01:22:46.083
History may have denied them
these moments,

01:22:46.247 --> 01:22:49.876
but through you
we have a window into the past.

01:22:50.047 --> 01:22:54.598
By documenting yourdeterioration,
we can ease the suffering of millions,

01:22:54.767 --> 01:22:59.557
who have, through no fault of theirown,
been left in the dark.

01:23:01.567 --> 01:23:04.400
How do you feel right now?

01:23:23.407 --> 01:23:25.318
Coooerate.

01:23:26.367 --> 01:23:28.278
Coooerate.

01:23:38.767 --> 01:23:42.043
I'm sorry. I'm an innovator.

01:24:10.367 --> 01:24:12.278
[Groans]

01:26:32.527 --> 01:26:34.438
[Camera shutterclicks]

01:26:39.527 --> 01:26:40.755
[Camera shutterclicks]

01:26:48.207 --> 01:26:50.118
Bad dream?

01:27:07.927 --> 01:27:09.724
I think sexual oolitics
are involved also

01:27:09.887 --> 01:27:12.879
because of cell oenetration
by the virus.

01:27:13.047 --> 01:27:14.958
The original host
takes on the role of the male

01:27:15.127 --> 01:27:17.687
and the newly infected is the female.

01:27:17.847 --> 01:27:21.283
And then the infected changes gender
to infect others,

01:27:21.447 --> 01:27:23.802
sort of the way
the reef fish change gender.

01:27:24.847 --> 01:27:27.520
It orobably says something
about your customers.

01:27:35.247 --> 01:27:39.559
Anyway, Ijust wanted to say I'm sorry
forthe way you're being treated here.

01:27:40.887 --> 01:27:44.197
If it had been uo to me,
we would have taken bettercare of you.

01:27:44.367 --> 01:27:46.039
[Levine sighs]

01:27:46.207 --> 01:27:49.279
But we gotta get this thing finished and
on the market while oeoole still care,

01:27:49.447 --> 01:27:52.041
otherwise there's no ooint.

01:27:52.887 --> 01:27:56.766
Besides, you owe me
forwhat you did to my rig.

01:28:01.127 --> 01:28:02.401
[Gasos]

01:28:02.567 --> 01:28:04.478
[Yells]

01:28:07.847 --> 01:28:09.758
[Yells]

01:29:55.527 --> 01:29:58.963
[Woman] Ask us about the new
Vole & Tesserrewards programme,

01:29:59.127 --> 01:30:02.005
now available at all
Vole & Tesserlocations.

01:30:19.487 --> 01:30:20.442
Back off!

01:30:39.807 --> 01:30:41.923
[March] Hello, Miss Tesser.

01:30:42.087 --> 01:30:44.203
[Tesser] Please, call me Mira.

01:30:47.287 --> 01:30:50.165
I'm sorry I'm not there
to speak with you in person.

01:30:51.047 --> 01:30:52.958
[March] I understand completely.

01:30:54.247 --> 01:30:58.001
[Tesser] I hearyou've been causing
problems forourgood friend Levine.

01:30:58.167 --> 01:30:59.725
[Chuckles]

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:02.560
Such a brilliant little man, isn't he?

01:31:02.727 --> 01:31:06.925
Is there any way I can convince you
to continue yourcollaboration?

01:31:07.087 --> 01:31:08.998
[March] I'm afraid not.

01:31:10.007 --> 01:31:12.157
[Tesser] That's a shame.

01:31:12.327 --> 01:31:15.125
We could make you excitingly famous.

01:31:18.647 --> 01:31:22.003
[March] I'd like to tell you something
about your virus.

01:31:22.167 --> 01:31:25.079
Oh? And what would that be?

01:31:25.887 --> 01:31:29.960
The contract Hannah Geist
signed with Lucas

01:31:30.127 --> 01:31:31.719
orevents you from selling herdiseases,

01:31:31.887 --> 01:31:37.007
but a... but a virus
you built and oatented yourself

01:31:37.167 --> 01:31:41.718
would remain your orooerty
even if it oassed through herbody.

01:31:43.207 --> 01:31:46.756
You could infect her, recoverthe samole

01:31:46.927 --> 01:31:49.282
and then sell it
as a Vole & Tesserexclusive.

01:31:50.327 --> 01:31:52.682
Is that true?

01:31:52.847 --> 01:31:56.283
It's why you commissioned the virus
from Derek Lessing

01:31:56.447 --> 01:31:59.564
and why he infected her
during a house call.

01:32:01.647 --> 01:32:04.081
It's a great loophole, isn't it?

01:32:04.247 --> 01:32:07.876
My idea, of course.
We stood to make a lot of money.

01:32:09.247 --> 01:32:12.239
Unfortunately there was a problem
with yourfriend Derek's build.

01:32:12.407 --> 01:32:15.399
I wanna know if it can be cured.

01:32:15.567 --> 01:32:17.125
I think so.

01:32:17.287 --> 01:32:19.721
However, producing a cure
would be costly,

01:32:19.887 --> 01:32:21.479
and as you acquired the virus
on yourown,

01:32:21.647 --> 01:32:24.719
we feel no responsibility
for yourcondition.

01:32:27.047 --> 01:32:29.197
I have something to barter.

01:32:36.647 --> 01:32:38.558
She'll be here in the moming.

01:32:51.087 --> 01:32:54.716
We're not sure, but, you know... No?

01:32:57.167 --> 01:33:02.480
Well, this is certainly
a heartbreaking tum of events.

01:33:02.647 --> 01:33:06.925
I mean, this really outs things
in oersoective, doesn't it, you know?

01:33:07.087 --> 01:33:09.362
Now, I would haooily
do something if I could,

01:33:09.527 --> 01:33:13.520
and the thought of a collaboration
between Miss Geist and our comoany

01:33:13.687 --> 01:33:15.006
is very aooealing.

01:33:15.167 --> 01:33:18.637
Unfortunately,
my soecialist here has advised me

01:33:18.807 --> 01:33:21.685
that she's too far gone to be saved.

01:33:21.847 --> 01:33:24.520
[Woman]
You'll be hearing from our lawyers.

01:33:24.687 --> 01:33:28.396
[Tesser] I think you'll find
we've taken the necessary orecautions.

01:33:28.567 --> 01:33:30.478
Now, if you'll excuse me...

01:33:31.927 --> 01:33:37.957
You know,
while I was a guest at yourclinic...

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:43.322
...I... I had some time
to think things over.

01:33:46.407 --> 01:33:50.480
I've been seeing
a little more clearly since then.

01:33:54.607 --> 01:34:00.239
Forexamole, I can see
that this is an imoortant moment.

01:34:02.007 --> 01:34:06.683
I can see an oooortunity here...

01:34:10.527 --> 01:34:13.644
...even in the face
of such a devastating tragedy.

01:34:16.207 --> 01:34:21.042
We... have a chance to innovate,

01:34:21.207 --> 01:34:27.396
and to do it in a way
that will benefit you both.

01:34:30.647 --> 01:34:33.400
The technology already exists...

01:34:35.127 --> 01:34:37.038
...and I know where to find it.

01:34:41.407 --> 01:34:43.875
Allow me to take a moment of yourtime.

01:34:46.727 --> 01:34:49.844
When I was a little girl,
my motherused to ask me,

01:34:50.007 --> 01:34:52.077
'What do you wanna be
when you grow up? '

01:34:52.247 --> 01:34:55.922
And I would tell her,
'I don't wanna grow up. '

01:34:56.087 --> 01:34:59.477
'I wanna stay young and beautiful. '

01:34:59.647 --> 01:35:02.844
So I guess in a way
this is my childhood dream realised.

01:35:04.367 --> 01:35:07.165
And I couldn't be more excited
to share it with you.

01:35:08.807 --> 01:35:12.197
Welcome, everyone, to my Afterlife,

01:35:12.367 --> 01:35:15.120
exclusively from Vole & Tesser.

01:35:21.967 --> 01:35:24.640
[Tesser]
From the oersoective of the virus,

01:35:24.807 --> 01:35:27.401
the human being is irrelevant.

01:35:27.567 --> 01:35:32.846
What matters is the system
that allows it to function.

01:35:33.847 --> 01:35:38.284
Skin cells, nerve cells,
the right home forthe right disease.

01:35:39.327 --> 01:35:42.160
Within our Afterlife caosule,

01:35:42.327 --> 01:35:47.447
the system that is Hannah Geist's body
has been oerpetuated,

01:35:47.607 --> 01:35:51.077
even expanded
beyond what existed during her lifetime.

01:35:51.247 --> 01:35:53.715
Make no mistake, however,

01:35:53.887 --> 01:35:57.038
this is not some glorified cell steak.

01:35:57.207 --> 01:35:58.879
Everything inside this housing

01:35:59.047 --> 01:36:01.641
is eitheroart of the original body

01:36:01.807 --> 01:36:03.843
orhas been grown directly from it

01:36:04.007 --> 01:36:07.886
as a result of our oatented
CellGarden technology.

01:36:08.047 --> 01:36:10.766
Our chief technician, Syd March,

01:36:10.927 --> 01:36:14.840
is about to load the latest virus
into the system,

01:36:15.007 --> 01:36:18.966
where it will infect Hannah's body

01:36:19.127 --> 01:36:24.565
before being sold as oart of our
Vole & TesserAfterlife oroduct line.

01:36:26.927 --> 01:36:29.964
Now, this is just a sneak oeek.

01:36:30.127 --> 01:36:32.846
If you wanna know
the nature of the infection,

01:36:33.007 --> 01:36:36.602
you'll have to wait
until it's announced officially

01:36:36.767 --> 01:36:40.680
at our oroduct conference
at the end of this month.

01:36:41.447 --> 01:36:44.405

Thanks so much for yourtime.

01:36:44.567 --> 01:36:45.966

- We'll see you at the end of the month.

01:38:39.247 --> 01:38:41.886
