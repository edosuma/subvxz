00:03.602 --> 00:05.901
A vessel has been detected.

00:05.971 --> 00:09.408
Unimatrix 424, grid 1 16.

00:09.476 --> 00:11.273
Activate.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.974
Alter course to intercept.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

00:47.113 --> 00:49.343
Vessel identified.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.544
Federation Starfleet;
lntrepid-class.

00:52.619 --> 00:56.350
143 life-forms.
Prepare for assimilation.

01:03.363 --> 01:05.297
We are the Borg.

01:05.364 --> 01:06.992
You will be assimilated.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.295
Resistance is futile.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.427
Break off your pursuit
or we'll open fire.

01:11.538 --> 01:12.470
lrrelevant.

01:12.539 --> 01:13.471
ls it?

01:13.540 --> 01:14.837
You've scanned our vessel.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.376
You know we can match
your firepower.

01:17.444 --> 01:19.139
You will be assimilated.

01:29.689 --> 01:32.157
Regenerate
primary shield matrix.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.250
Remodulate weapons.

01:44.070 --> 01:45.935
Security breach.

01:46.005 --> 01:47.939
Starfleet photon torpedo.

01:48.007 --> 01:49.372
Disarm weapon.

02:09.829 --> 02:11.956
l thought we were trying
to disable it.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.829
The torpedo detonated
near the power matrix.

02:14.901 --> 02:17.028
lt caused a chain reaction.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.069
Survivors?

02:19.139 --> 02:20.538
None.

02:20.607 --> 02:21.631
Debris status?

02:21.741 --> 02:23.436
There's a few
components intact,

02:23.510 --> 02:25.273
but they're badly damaged.

02:25.345 --> 02:27.711
Begin a salvage operation.

02:27.780 --> 02:28.769
Captain?

02:28.848 --> 02:30.907
There might be something
we can use--

02:30.984 --> 02:33.145
weapons, a transwarp coil...

02:33.219 --> 02:37.747
l don't know
about the rest of you...

02:37.824 --> 02:40.554
but l feel lucky today.

04:55.328 --> 04:59.560
Now, this is how l prefer
the Borg-- in pieces.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.090
Eight kilotons of debris--
most of it hull fragments.

05:03.202 --> 05:05.397
So far, we've recovered
two power nodes

05:05.505 --> 05:08.474
and a dozen plasma conduits,
all in working order.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.872
Their propulsion system--
anything left?

05:10.977 --> 05:13.377
B'Elanna found a transwarp coil.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.809
lt's lighter than l expected.

05:17.884 --> 05:21.718
Must be some kind
of polytrinic alloy.

05:21.788 --> 05:22.846
Let's hope our little

05:22.922 --> 05:24.412
skirmish got back
to the hive mind.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.653
Maybe they'll think twice
before they attack us again.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.126
lt was only a probe.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.129
Next time,
we might not be so lucky.

05:31.197 --> 05:32.994
Captain!

05:33.066 --> 05:34.431
Don't touch that.

05:34.534 --> 05:35.899
What is it?

05:36.002 --> 05:38.061
l don't know,
but a few minutes ago,

05:38.171 --> 05:40.162
it was crawling
around the floor.

05:40.273 --> 05:42.707
l think it's some kind
of auto-regeneration unit.

05:42.775 --> 05:44.936
Thanks for the warning.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.308
By my count, we've added
at least two years

05:47.380 --> 05:49.575
to our journey
by avoiding the Borg.

05:49.649 --> 05:52.140
l'm tired of turning tail
every time we detect a cube.

05:52.218 --> 05:54.277
Better safe than assimilated.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.548
Mmm...

05:55.621 --> 05:58.590
Maybe l should go to Red Alert
and get it over with.

05:58.658 --> 05:59.784
Commander?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.850
You're about to drop
one of your bombshells.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.656
Now, what makes you say that?

06:03.696 --> 06:05.493
The way you fiddle
with your combadge.

06:07.467 --> 06:08.991
You do it every time.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.569
Well, l'll have to keep
an eye on that.

06:10.670 --> 06:12.638
Eureka!

06:12.739 --> 06:14.832
l was hoping to find
one of these.

06:15.007 --> 06:18.602
lt's a servo-armature
from a medical repair drone--

06:18.678 --> 06:19.872
laser scalpel,

06:20.012 --> 06:21.980
biomolecular scanner,
microsuture--

06:22.048 --> 06:23.515
all rolled into one instrument.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.575
No Federation Sick Bay
should be without one.

06:27.653 --> 06:29.348
This could
revolutionize the way

06:29.422 --> 06:30.684
that l perform surgery.

06:30.757 --> 06:31.849
Excellent.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.859
Why don't you deactivate
it for now, hmm?

06:34.927 --> 06:37.225
Remodulate the coil frequency.

06:40.032 --> 06:41.795
No effect.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.368
Try again.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.797
The field regulator is fused.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.808
What seems to be the problem?

06:50.877 --> 06:53.141
We can't activate
the transwarp coil.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.680
When a Borg vessel
is critically damaged,

06:55.748 --> 06:57.943
all of its vital technology
self-destructs.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.279
The coil is beyond repair.

07:00.353 --> 07:02.821
At least the Doctor
found a new toy.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.889
Captain.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.753
Data nodes.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.297
One of them
is a drone manifest.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.299
The other contains
tactical information.

07:14.400 --> 07:15.389
Specifically?

07:15.501 --> 07:17.469
Long-range sensor telemetry,
assimilation logistics

07:17.570 --> 07:20.266
and vessel movements
for a radius of 30 light-years.

07:20.373 --> 07:21.203
Well, let's take a look.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.571
l'll need to convert
the information

07:22.642 --> 07:23.574
to Starfleet parameters.

07:23.643 --> 07:24.575
Time?

07:24.644 --> 07:25.611
Two hours.

07:25.678 --> 07:26.645
Do it.

07:36.255 --> 07:38.723
After nine hours
of staring at that debris,

07:38.791 --> 07:41.259
l was beginning
to feel like a drone.

07:41.327 --> 07:43.124
l could use a shower.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.130
Do Borgs shower?

07:45.198 --> 07:46.893
Neelix?

07:46.966 --> 07:48.763
We need a couple of beers.

07:48.868 --> 07:49.892
Name your malt.

07:50.002 --> 07:51.936
Ktarian and replicate
a pint for yourself

07:52.071 --> 07:54.938
because we are going to toast
the man of the hour.

07:55.007 --> 07:56.099
Oh.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.074
Yeah, it was Harry's idea
to beam over a photon torpedo

07:58.144 --> 07:59.975
while they were remodulating
their shields.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.674
l didn't think
they'd fall for it.

08:02.748 --> 08:04.716
Ah, but they did,
hook, line and sinker.

08:06.118 --> 08:09.178
l would have loved to have seen
the look on their faces. Boom!

08:09.255 --> 08:10.517
Well, to be honest,

08:10.590 --> 08:12.615
l wish the boom would
have been a bit smaller.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.455
We were only trying
to disable them.

08:14.527 --> 08:15.585
They were drones, Harry.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.425
Mindless automatons.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.965
We did them a favor.

08:21.868 --> 08:22.994
Seven.

08:24.604 --> 08:26.037
Um...

08:26.105 --> 08:28.539
Look, l, l didn't mean
anything by that.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.699
Your apology is irrelevant.

08:30.810 --> 08:34.177
lt's impossible to offend
a mindless drone.

08:38.784 --> 08:40.615
Cheers.

08:49.295 --> 08:52.492
l was able to recover
62 percent of the data.

08:52.565 --> 08:54.328
This is an iso-grid of Borg

08:54.400 --> 08:57.369
tactical movements
across 25 sectors.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.063
Are there any dangers
along our present course?

09:00.806 --> 09:02.171
There are three cubes

09:02.241 --> 09:04.937
approximately nine light-years
away, traveling

09:05.011 --> 09:06.478
on a trajectory
parallel to our own.

09:06.579 --> 09:07.637
They do not pose a threat.

09:07.713 --> 09:08.873
What about that vessel?

09:11.117 --> 09:12.744
lt's a scout ship

09:12.818 --> 09:14.683
eight light-years away,
traveling at warp 2.

09:14.754 --> 09:17.484
The ship is heavily damaged.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.752
Was it attacked?

09:19.825 --> 09:21.816
No. An ion storm.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.361
The sphere is presently
regenerating.

09:23.429 --> 09:26.159
That explains why it's
traveling at low warp.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.563
Limping home.

09:27.633 --> 09:29.191
ln a manner of speaking.

09:29.302 --> 09:32.237
l want a detailed schematic
of this vessel,

09:32.305 --> 09:36.605
down to the power
distribution nodes.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.110
l think we've just struck gold.

09:40.613 --> 09:43.844
So what we have here
in two simple words is...

09:45.551 --> 09:47.519
Fort Knox.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.781
Captain?

09:48.854 --> 09:50.879
Tom, translate?

09:50.990 --> 09:56.189
Fort Knox-- the largest
repository of gold bullion

09:56.262 --> 09:57.991
in Earth's history.

09:58.064 --> 09:59.895
Over 50 metric tons

09:59.999 --> 10:01.899
worth over $9 trillion
US dollars.

10:02.068 --> 10:03.592
Keep going.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.866
Well, uh,
when the new world economy

10:06.973 --> 10:08.998
took shape
in the late 22nd century

10:09.108 --> 10:11.406
and money went
the way of the dinosaur,

10:11.477 --> 10:13.945
Fort Knox was turned
into a museum.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.174
And no one ever managed to break
into that facility, right?

10:17.249 --> 10:21.185
Well, a couple of Ferengi tried
about ten years ago,

10:21.253 --> 10:23.619
but other than that,
it's considered impenetrable.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.520
Are you planning a heist?

10:25.591 --> 10:27.456
As a matter of fact.

10:27.526 --> 10:29.960
Except we're not chasing gold.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.054
We're going to steal
a transwarp coil.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.429
Think it might come in handy?

10:34.500 --> 10:36.661
lf l could equip our engines
with even one coil,

10:36.769 --> 10:38.862
we could shave about 20 years
off this trip.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.565
Do you believe the Borg sphere
is damaged enough

10:41.674 --> 10:43.403
for us to penetrate
its defenses?

10:43.476 --> 10:46.206
Long enough to take what we want
and get out in one piece,

10:46.278 --> 10:47.939
but we'd have to plan
this operation

10:48.014 --> 10:49.106
down to the millisecond.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.808
There would be no margin
for error.

10:50.883 --> 10:53.249
As l see it, we plan
an intercept course

10:53.319 --> 10:55.344
that won't attract
their attention,

10:55.421 --> 10:57.355
then create a diversion
to keep them occupied,

10:57.423 --> 10:59.891
so we can send in an away team
to obtain the technology.

10:59.959 --> 11:02.018
l'd like to see the data
on that sphere.

11:02.128 --> 11:04.926
We might be able to re-create
parts of it on the holodeck,

11:04.997 --> 11:06.362
run a few tactical simulations.

11:06.432 --> 11:07.626
lt's all yours.

11:07.700 --> 11:09.497
We need to mask
our warp signature.

11:09.602 --> 11:11.729
l've got a few Maquis tricks
up my sleeve.

11:11.837 --> 11:15.295
They're not exactly
Starfleet-approved, but...

11:15.408 --> 11:18.377
This is no time for protocol.
Get started.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.638
The sphere is three days away
by maximum warp.

11:20.713 --> 11:22.203
Set a course.

11:22.281 --> 11:24.408
Chakotay, l want an outline
for our heist

11:24.483 --> 11:25.541
by tomorrow morning.

11:25.618 --> 11:27.916
We've proven ourselves
against the Borg

11:27.987 --> 11:29.921
once before-- twice before--

11:29.989 --> 11:32.253
but we're always the ones
under attack.

11:32.324 --> 11:33.484
l think it's time to do

11:33.559 --> 11:35.527
a little assimilating
of our own, hmm?

11:35.594 --> 11:36.720
Dismissed.

11:44.403 --> 11:46.462
l was hoping you'd be
a little more vocal.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.972
Any thoughts?

11:49.041 --> 11:50.872
Your plan is ambitious.

11:50.943 --> 11:54.504
There are many variables,
but it can succeed.

11:54.580 --> 11:57.572
l'd like to narrow
that list of variables.

11:57.650 --> 12:00.676
l was hoping your parents
might provide us

12:00.753 --> 12:02.345
with a few insights.

12:02.421 --> 12:05.754
l've been looking over
the records we found

12:05.825 --> 12:07.452
on the USS Raven.

12:07.526 --> 12:10.324
Your parents kept
extensive field notes--

12:10.396 --> 12:11.624
detailed journals.

12:11.697 --> 12:14.291
There are over 9,000
log entries alone.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.061
The information is irrelevant.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.999
On the contrary, Seven.

12:18.104 --> 12:21.596
They spent their careers
studying the Borg.

12:21.707 --> 12:23.800
They tracked a cube
at close range

12:23.909 --> 12:25.206
for what-- two years?

12:25.277 --> 12:26.505
Three.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.479
Well, l'd say
that made them experts.

12:30.483 --> 12:33.213
l want you
to study their research.

12:33.285 --> 12:37.483
Look for any data that might
give us a tactical edge.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.524
My parents were assimilated.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.083
Obviously,
their tactics were flawed.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.822
Look...

12:45.998 --> 12:48.728
these records have been
collecting dust in our database

12:48.834 --> 12:49.823
for over a year.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.062
You say they're irrelevant,

12:52.171 --> 12:55.470
and l say
you've been avoiding them.

12:55.541 --> 12:57.304
You're the best person
for the job,

12:57.376 --> 12:59.367
but l'll assign it
to Chakotay if...

12:59.445 --> 13:00.469
No.

13:00.579 --> 13:03.275
The information belongs to me.

13:03.315 --> 13:06.113
l will read it.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.627
You're late.

13:20.699 --> 13:21.825
Sorry.

13:21.901 --> 13:25.337
lt took longer than l expected
to download these records.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.372
This is only the first batch.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.998
Your parents sure had
a lot to say.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.942
l organized the information
by category--

13:33.078 --> 13:38.539
field notes, personal logs,
biokinetic analyses.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.244
l don't mean to pry,

13:40.319 --> 13:44.187
but is it true your parents
were studying the Borg?

13:44.256 --> 13:47.657
Yes. The Hansens
were exobiologists.

13:47.726 --> 13:48.954
Fascinating.

13:49.028 --> 13:51.053
They must have been
very courageous.

13:51.130 --> 13:53.257
They were misguided.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.535
A faded holo-image.

14:00.039 --> 14:02.906
That's all l've got left
of my family.

14:02.942 --> 14:06.207
A picture of my sister.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.542
Except, of course,
what l keep in here.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.814
What l wouldn't give
for a treasure trove like this.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.385
Well...

14:22.461 --> 14:25.157
l'd better get started
on the rest of those files.

14:31.937 --> 14:36.636
Field notes, USS Raven,
Stardate 3261 1.4.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.540
lt's about time.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.340
The Federation Council
on Exobiology

14:40.412 --> 14:42.312
has given us final approval.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.576
Starfleet's still concerned
about security issues,

14:44.650 --> 14:46.709
but they've agreed
not to stand in our way.

14:46.785 --> 14:48.912
We've said our good-byes,
and we're ready

14:48.988 --> 14:50.956
to start chasing
our theories about the Borg.

14:51.056 --> 14:56.494
Zoom... zoom...

14:57.663 --> 15:00.188
Ah... put down the cube, muffin.

15:00.266 --> 15:01.597
lt's not a toy.

15:01.667 --> 15:02.861
l won't crash it.

15:04.837 --> 15:05.804
Come here.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.805
Daddy wants to talk to you.

15:07.873 --> 15:08.840
Come here.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.370
Now...

15:12.444 --> 15:14.878
remember when l said
that you, me and mommy

15:14.980 --> 15:16.641
were going
on a very long voyage?

15:16.715 --> 15:18.012
Uh-huh.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.883
Well, we're leaving tomorrow

15:21.954 --> 15:24.479
and we won't see Earth
for quite a while.

15:24.556 --> 15:26.717
Are we going to see the Borg?

15:26.792 --> 15:28.487
lf we're lucky.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.653
Do the Borg have kids, too?

15:30.729 --> 15:32.663
Well, nobody knows.

15:32.731 --> 15:35.791
We'll be the first humans
to study them up close.

15:35.901 --> 15:37.801
What do they look like?

15:37.870 --> 15:40.202
Well, we're not sure, exactly,

15:40.272 --> 15:43.298
but we think they might
look a lot like us,

15:43.409 --> 15:47.345
but with technology
inside their bodies.

15:47.413 --> 15:51.213
Cy-ber-netic?

15:53.252 --> 15:54.947
Mm-hmm.

15:55.020 --> 15:56.146
Are they friendly?

15:56.221 --> 15:59.622
Well, they're different.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.159
They don't talk like us,

16:01.260 --> 16:03.285
or even think like us, but...

16:03.329 --> 16:05.661
we're hoping to make
friends one day.

16:05.731 --> 16:07.392
l hope so, too, Daddy.

16:11.403 --> 16:15.339
Field notes, USS Raven,
Stardate 32623.5.

16:15.441 --> 16:17.136
We've been tracking
stray readings

16:17.209 --> 16:18.642
for nearly eight months now,

16:18.711 --> 16:21.043
but there's still
no sign of a vessel.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.410
l'm beginning to wonder

16:22.481 --> 16:25.541
if the Borg are nothing more
than rumor and sensor echoes.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.209
Magnus?

16:27.286 --> 16:28.776
We have to keep moving.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.981
lf we take
the replicators off-line

16:31.056 --> 16:32.785
and run environmental systems
at half power,

16:32.858 --> 16:35.088
we can go another 20 light-years
before refueling.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.388
We should refuel now.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.726
The nearest dilithium
is in an asteroid field

16:38.797 --> 16:40.526
just ten days from here.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.659
That's ten days
we can't afford to lose.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.638
We're getting close.

16:47.706 --> 16:50.174
lf we stop now,
we might as well

16:50.275 --> 16:52.334
just turn around and go home.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.572
Home? To what?

16:54.646 --> 16:56.944
We have deviated
from our flight plan,

16:57.082 --> 16:58.845
crossed the Neutral Zone,

16:58.917 --> 17:01.579
disobeyed a direct order
to return.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.679
Our colleagues obviously
think we are insane.

17:04.757 --> 17:07.487
We have burned
our bridges, Magnus.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.525
l can't sleep.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.296
Come here.

17:23.008 --> 17:26.307
Why can't Annika sleep?

17:26.377 --> 17:28.436
The greatest scientific
mystery of our time.

17:28.513 --> 17:31.540
l have a hypothesis.

17:31.617 --> 17:34.381
Her noisy parents
are keeping her up.

17:34.453 --> 17:35.385
Hmm.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.581
Sounds plausible.

17:42.494 --> 17:46.931
Triquantum waves-- 600,000
kilometers off the port bow.

17:49.835 --> 17:51.530
Subspace disruptions.

17:51.637 --> 17:54.435
Field magnitude
2.9 teracochranes and rising.

17:54.506 --> 17:55.837
Annika, bed.

17:59.311 --> 18:01.711
Power utilization curve
is highly symmetric.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.282
Artificial source
probability .98.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.045
Now.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.089
lt's got to be
a transwarp conduit.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.921
Nothing else could
generate these readings.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.824
l'm taking us closer.

18:23.001 --> 18:27.335
lt's a Borg cube--
2,000 kilometers starboard.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.966
l've got a visual.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.873
lt's massive.

18:40.119 --> 18:46.251
28 cubic kilometers,
129,000 life-forms on board.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.756
We're being scanned.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.390
They haven't altered course.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.457
This could prove our theory.

18:56.535 --> 19:00.528
They ignore any life-form
until they consider it a threat,

19:00.639 --> 19:03.733
or a target.

19:05.344 --> 19:07.574
They're moving off.

19:07.646 --> 19:10.206
Let's match
their course and speed.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.773
Keep a distance
of five million kilometers.

19:27.633 --> 19:30.124
Seven of Nine to the Bridge.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.837
On my way.

19:34.439 --> 19:36.031
Have we been detected?

19:36.141 --> 19:37.403
No, ma'am.

19:37.476 --> 19:39.034
l have a visual.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.976
On screen.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.676
Magnify.

19:44.750 --> 19:47.583
Looks like they took
a real beating.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.314
They could still pose a threat.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.151
Let's not get too close.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.155
Match their course and speed.

19:52.224 --> 19:53.885
Keep a distance
of ten million kilometers.

19:54.026 --> 19:54.890
Aye, Captain.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.051
Seven, scan the vessel.

19:56.128 --> 19:57.652
l want to know
their current status.

20:02.801 --> 20:04.792
Their weapons array
is regenerating,

20:04.870 --> 20:07.430
but shields and transwarp drive
are still off-line.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.336
How long
until they have transwarp?

20:09.408 --> 20:11.376
Approximately 72 hours.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.775
We may not get
this opportunity again

20:13.845 --> 20:15.813
and l don't intend to miss it,
whatever it takes.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.542
Double shifts,
'round-the-clock simulations.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.709
l want to be ready.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.281
Bridge to away teams.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.180
You're six seconds
behind schedule.

21:31.256 --> 21:33.190
We are at the shield matrix.

21:33.258 --> 21:34.885
Stand by.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.292
Primary shield generator--
l've got it.

21:37.362 --> 21:41.594
Spatial charges--
here, there and there.

22:09.928 --> 22:11.520
You've got 55 seconds.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.499
Tuvok to Janeway.
Charges set.

22:23.608 --> 22:25.906
We are returning to the
transport coordinates.

22:28.146 --> 22:30.080
The transwarp coil is off-line.

22:30.148 --> 22:31.945
Tuvok, now.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.985
Activate the charges.

22:37.389 --> 22:39.380
Bridge, their shields are down.

22:39.458 --> 22:40.755
Energize.

22:40.826 --> 22:42.316
Tom?

22:44.563 --> 22:46.531
l've got a lock.

22:48.300 --> 22:50.291
Target obtained.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.221
You're out of time.

23:47.559 --> 23:48.958
They've adapted.

23:49.060 --> 23:50.357
This way.

23:53.532 --> 23:54.499
Seven!

24:08.513 --> 24:10.913
Bridge, stand by for transport.

24:12.751 --> 24:13.581
Hurry!

24:17.122 --> 24:18.589
Energize.

24:20.659 --> 24:23.355
l've got them.
Transporter Room 1.

24:25.063 --> 24:26.223
Beam them out of here.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.560
l can't get a lock.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.226
They've adapted
to our transport frequencies.

24:30.335 --> 24:32.428
Computer, freeze program,
both holodecks.

24:34.873 --> 24:36.306
What happened?

24:37.375 --> 24:39.843
They tapped
into our transporter beam.

24:39.911 --> 24:41.435
Chakotay to Holodeck 2.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.310
We got the transwarp coil,

24:43.381 --> 24:45.542
but we also picked up
some uninvited guests.

24:45.617 --> 24:46.879
What was our time?

24:46.952 --> 24:48.214
Two minutes, 12 seconds.

24:48.286 --> 24:49.548
12 seconds too late.

24:49.621 --> 24:50.952
Once we disable
their sensor grid,

24:51.022 --> 24:52.956
we only have two minutes
until it regenerates.

24:53.024 --> 24:54.491
Did you run into any problems?

24:54.559 --> 24:55.389
None.

24:55.460 --> 24:56.620
We were efficient.

24:56.695 --> 24:58.890
What if we try to beam directly
into the transwarp chamber?

24:58.964 --> 25:00.158
There's too much shielding.

25:00.265 --> 25:02.597
Perhaps we could
modify our transporters.

25:02.667 --> 25:03.929
l've already explored
that option.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.468
lt won't work.

25:05.537 --> 25:07.505
12 seconds... might
as well be an eternity.

25:07.572 --> 25:10.871
The Hansens... they were able
to remain inside a Borg cube

25:10.942 --> 25:13.308
for several hours
without being detected.

25:13.378 --> 25:14.174
How?

25:14.246 --> 25:15.713
l'm not certain.

25:15.780 --> 25:17.145
Well, keep investigating.

25:17.215 --> 25:18.876
Yes, Captain.

25:18.950 --> 25:20.815
We've run enough simulations
for one day.

25:20.886 --> 25:22.478
Let's work
on refining our tactics.

25:22.554 --> 25:24.852
Anything we can do to shave
a few more seconds

25:24.923 --> 25:26.322
off our little heist.

25:26.391 --> 25:27.983
Computer, end program.

25:30.695 --> 25:31.753
l don't know about you,

25:31.830 --> 25:33.127
but l'm glad
to be back on Voyager.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.325
Borg vessels make my skin crawl.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.265
lt was a holodeck re-creation.

25:37.369 --> 25:38.666
Close enough.

25:38.770 --> 25:41.898
We've just spent the last
three hours dodging drones.

25:42.073 --> 25:43.370
lt didn't bother you?

25:43.441 --> 25:44.703
Your point?

25:44.776 --> 25:47.370
You seemed a little nervous
in there.

25:47.445 --> 25:51.711
The last time l was on
a Borg vessel, l was a drone.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.217
The re-creation was unsettling.

25:54.286 --> 25:56.880
You were reluctant to look
at your parents' research,

25:56.955 --> 25:58.923
and now l sense
you're a little reluctant

25:58.990 --> 26:00.184
to go on this mission.

26:00.292 --> 26:01.623
Maybe l'm pushing you too fast.

26:01.660 --> 26:02.922
l'll adapt.

26:02.994 --> 26:04.256
lt's easier said than done.

26:04.329 --> 26:05.591
lt's been over two years

26:05.664 --> 26:07.598
since you came face-to-face
with the collective.

26:07.666 --> 26:09.133
Are you sure you're up to it?

26:09.234 --> 26:11.134
l need everybody working
at peak efficiency.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.760
You doubt my ability
to function?

26:12.871 --> 26:14.805
No. l'm simply
voicing my concerns.

26:14.873 --> 26:16.431
They are unjustified.

26:16.541 --> 26:17.974
l hope so,

26:18.043 --> 26:20.637
because the next time,
we won't be on the holodeck.

26:20.712 --> 26:22.339
Understood.

26:41.766 --> 26:44.291
Naomi Wildman.

26:45.403 --> 26:47.371
l had a bad dream.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.270
Can l stay with you for a while?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.673
Where is your mother?

26:51.743 --> 26:53.711
She's working in Engineering,

26:53.778 --> 26:56.440
and Neelix is on a duty shift.

26:56.514 --> 26:57.776
Please?

26:57.849 --> 26:59.817
l won't bother you.

27:01.152 --> 27:02.847
Very well.

27:05.490 --> 27:07.583
lt looked just like this.

27:07.659 --> 27:09.251
What did?

27:09.327 --> 27:10.817
ln my dream.

27:10.929 --> 27:12.897
There was Borg stuff everywhere.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.558
Elaborate.

27:16.668 --> 27:18.363
l went on the mission--

27:18.470 --> 27:22.270
the one my mom told me about,
the Borg sphere--

27:22.340 --> 27:23.807
but it didn't work.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.968
Everybody got assimilated.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.638
Nightmares are caused
by irrational fear.

27:28.713 --> 27:29.975
They're not real.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.515
They can't damage you.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.845
Try to ignore it.

27:32.917 --> 27:36.318
Mom said we're going
to steal something.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.855
A transwarp coil.

27:37.922 --> 27:40.186
Will you be on the sphere?

27:40.258 --> 27:41.748
Yes.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.521
Are you scared?

27:43.595 --> 27:46.120
We will succeed.

27:46.197 --> 27:47.892
But what if you don't?

27:47.999 --> 27:49.796
What if they make you
a drone again?

27:49.901 --> 27:52.131
Naomi Wildman,
you agreed not to bother me.

27:52.237 --> 27:55.035
What's it like to be a drone?

27:55.106 --> 27:56.505
Does it hurt?

27:56.574 --> 27:58.940
You will terminate
this line of questioning.

27:59.044 --> 28:01.171
Do the Borg have kids?

28:03.314 --> 28:05.179
What do they look like?

28:05.250 --> 28:07.445
Are they friendly?

28:10.155 --> 28:13.090
Return to your quarters
immediately.

28:13.158 --> 28:15.319
Resistance is futile.

28:26.404 --> 28:28.133
Seven of Nine to Security.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.639
lntruder alert.

28:29.708 --> 28:32.643
They can't hear you.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.645
Who are you?

28:34.713 --> 28:36.647
l am the Borg.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.979
Seven of Nine, Tertiary Adjunct

28:39.050 --> 28:43.487
of Unimatrix Zero One,
you've become weak.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.648
This is a dream.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.988
l'm regenerating.

28:48.059 --> 28:49.492
lt's not a dream.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.825
We've accessed
your neural transceiver.

28:51.896 --> 28:54.330
Our thoughts are one.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.096
We know about Voyager's plan
to invade the sphere.

28:58.203 --> 28:59.636
lt will fail.

28:59.704 --> 29:03.071
lf that's true, then why
haven't you assimilated them?

29:03.174 --> 29:05.938
We've come to make you an offer.

29:05.977 --> 29:09.174
Rejoin the collective
and we'll spare Voyager.

29:11.316 --> 29:13.409
Why me?

29:13.485 --> 29:16.477
Because... you are unique.

29:33.004 --> 29:36.838
Field notes, USS Raven,
Stardate 32629.4.

29:36.908 --> 29:39.604
After three months of tracking
our Borg cube,

29:39.677 --> 29:41.702
the vessel entered
a transwarp conduit.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.611
We followed in its wake.

29:43.681 --> 29:45.774
Our sensors tell us
we've traveled all the way

29:45.850 --> 29:50.150
to the Delta Quadrant,
the Borg's native territory.

29:50.221 --> 29:52.416
Magnus, you're breaking up.

29:52.490 --> 29:55.459
lt's just some bioelectric
interference. Stand by.

29:55.527 --> 29:56.619
ls that better?

29:56.694 --> 29:58.252
Much.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.388
How's Junior?

30:00.465 --> 30:04.424
He took a real beating when
that plasma conduit blew out.

30:15.513 --> 30:17.140
He's regenerating.

30:21.419 --> 30:22.408
Wait a minute.

30:22.487 --> 30:24.114
Something's happening.

30:24.189 --> 30:28.353
Bill and Needle Fingers
just arrived.

30:32.530 --> 30:33.622
This is odd.

30:33.698 --> 30:36.292
They're making repairs
to Junior.

30:36.367 --> 30:37.459
l thought drones

30:37.569 --> 30:39.730
from different subunits
didn't interact.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.305
Looks like we were wrong.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.669
They deactivated him.

30:47.745 --> 30:49.508
Why?

30:49.581 --> 30:51.549
Maybe he was too badly damaged.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.749
They're dismantling him.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.813
They must be salvaging
the components.

31:07.665 --> 31:09.360
Your biodampener
is losing power.

31:09.434 --> 31:10.662
lt's time to come home.

31:10.768 --> 31:12.235
l've got another minute or so.

31:12.303 --> 31:13.235
Stand by.

31:13.304 --> 31:15.135
We may not get another chance

31:15.206 --> 31:16.798
to observe this behavior.

31:22.013 --> 31:24.607
lt prevented the Borg
from detecting them.

31:24.682 --> 31:27.116
They referred to it
as a biodampener.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.948
The device creates
a field around the body

31:29.087 --> 31:31.078
which simulates
the physiometric conditions

31:31.155 --> 31:32.144
within a Borg vessel.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.155
Camouflage.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.282
Precisely.

31:34.359 --> 31:35.951
We need four of these devices.

31:36.027 --> 31:37.790
How soon can you replicate them?

31:37.862 --> 31:40.797
l'll have to tailor each unit
to its user's physiology.

31:40.865 --> 31:41.957
A few hours at least.

31:42.033 --> 31:43.091
Begin immediately.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.668
l'll inform the Captain.

31:46.571 --> 31:47.731
lngenious design.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.932
The Hansens were resourceful.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.475
Sounds like you're
warming up to your folks.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.101
lt was merely an observation.

31:54.178 --> 31:55.543
This is an important stage

31:55.613 --> 31:57.740
of your social development,
Seven.

31:57.815 --> 32:00.943
Try not to think of it
as simply a research project,

32:01.085 --> 32:03.883
but as an exploration
of how you were raised.

32:03.955 --> 32:06.549
My parents underestimated
the collective.

32:06.624 --> 32:08.216
They were destroyed.

32:08.293 --> 32:11.353
Because of their arrogance,
l was raised by Borg.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.652
Captain's Log, supplemental.

32:34.719 --> 32:37.654
Operation Fort Knox is ready
to proceed.

32:37.722 --> 32:39.952
All departments are standing by

32:40.058 --> 32:43.585
and l've given the order
to begin at 0600 hours.

32:43.661 --> 32:44.923
Coffee?

32:44.996 --> 32:47.760
You look like you
could use some.

32:47.832 --> 32:48.821
No.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.562
lt's a human vice
you might want to try one day.

32:51.669 --> 32:52.601
Keeps you sharp.

32:52.670 --> 32:54.467
One day.

32:55.707 --> 32:57.698
l've been fine-tuning
our game plan

32:57.809 --> 32:59.174
for tomorrow morning...

32:59.243 --> 33:01.973
and l've decided to reassign you
to the Bridge.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.604
Captain...

33:03.648 --> 33:05.775
l'm concerned
about Voyager's safety

33:05.850 --> 33:07.511
and if the sphere decides
to attack,

33:07.585 --> 33:09.382
l'll need your expertise
at tactical.

33:09.454 --> 33:11.012
l should be on the away team.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.489
B'Elanna will do just fine
in your place.

33:13.558 --> 33:16.425
You may encounter unexpected
obstacles-- force fields,

33:16.494 --> 33:17.426
encryption codes.

33:17.495 --> 33:18.519
l'm the only member

33:18.596 --> 33:20.188
of this crew
who can anticipate them.

33:20.264 --> 33:22.892
You underestimate
the rest of us?

33:23.034 --> 33:25.594
And you underestimate the Borg.

33:29.173 --> 33:33.269
This is more than just
a question of tactics.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.802
l'm concerned
about your well-being...

33:36.881 --> 33:40.942
and your ability to perform
on this mission.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.351
Your concern is unwarranted.

33:43.421 --> 33:44.615
ls it?

33:44.689 --> 33:47.055
l'm not the only one
who's worried about you.

33:47.125 --> 33:48.752
Chakotay, Neelix, the Doctor--

33:48.826 --> 33:51.124
we've all noticed changes
in your behavior.

33:51.195 --> 33:54.358
You are preoccupied, agitated,

33:54.432 --> 33:57.367
and you're making mistakes.

33:57.468 --> 33:59.595
Don't get me wrong.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.103
l appreciate your efforts

34:01.205 --> 34:04.174
and we couldn't have come
this far without your help...

34:04.208 --> 34:08.201
but it's obviously taken
its toll.

34:08.279 --> 34:09.303
lf l'd realized

34:09.380 --> 34:11.109
how those journals were going
to affect you,

34:11.181 --> 34:12.877
l never would have pushed you
to read them,

34:12.949 --> 34:14.143
and l'm not about to ask you

34:14.217 --> 34:17.085
to face the collective
in your present frame of mind.

34:18.188 --> 34:21.487
The past several days
have been difficult,

34:21.559 --> 34:23.618
but l must join the away team,

34:23.694 --> 34:27.094
and l assure you
l will not make another mistake.

34:30.101 --> 34:33.036
l've made my decision, Seven.

34:33.103 --> 34:37.040
lf l don't go,
this mission will fail.

34:37.141 --> 34:40.201
You sound awfully
certain about that.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.643
l know the Borg.

34:42.713 --> 34:43.940
And l know you.

34:44.081 --> 34:47.108
There's more
to what you're saying.

34:47.185 --> 34:48.344
What's wrong?

34:52.857 --> 34:55.223
Over the past two years,
l have become familiar

34:55.293 --> 34:57.659
with the individuals
on this vessel.

34:57.728 --> 35:00.390
Voyager is my collective now.

35:02.433 --> 35:05.266
Your survival
is important to me.

35:05.369 --> 35:08.497
l am willing to risk
my own well-being,

35:08.606 --> 35:10.506
if it increases
our chances of success.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.969
Assign me to the away team...

35:18.916 --> 35:21.180
please.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.098
Thank you.

35:44.175 --> 35:45.472
Seven.

35:50.515 --> 35:54.713
You've made remarkable progress
as an individual

35:54.785 --> 35:57.219
and as a member of this crew.

35:57.288 --> 35:59.381
For what it's worth...

35:59.457 --> 36:03.188
Voyager wouldn't be
the same without you.

36:15.439 --> 36:17.498
A vessel has been detected.

36:17.608 --> 36:21.044
Unimatrix 424, grid 03.

36:21.112 --> 36:22.670
Activate.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.900
Vessel identified.

36:49.040 --> 36:52.441
Federation Starfleet
class-2 shuttlecraft.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.068
Three life-forms.

36:54.145 --> 36:57.114
The sphere's maintaining course.

36:57.181 --> 36:59.809
Move the shuttle in closer.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.185
The Borg
are still ignoring it.

37:07.792 --> 37:09.726
Bridge to Transporter Room 2.

37:09.794 --> 37:11.125
They're not taking the bait.

37:11.195 --> 37:12.127
Shuttle status?

37:12.196 --> 37:13.356
All systems go.

37:13.431 --> 37:15.160
False bio-readings
are holding steady.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.224
How about a phaser shot
across their bow?

37:17.335 --> 37:18.666
Might grab their attention.

37:18.769 --> 37:20.464
No. The shuttle
would be perceived

37:20.571 --> 37:22.368
as a threat
and they'd destroy it.

37:22.440 --> 37:24.499
Commander, increase
the energy output

37:24.609 --> 37:26.270
of the shuttle's warp profile.

37:26.344 --> 37:29.745
That should present
a more inviting target.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.885
Warp signature detected.

37:35.987 --> 37:39.013
Prepare for assimilation.
Relevant technology.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.684
Engage tractor pulse.

37:41.759 --> 37:43.351
They've got it.

37:43.427 --> 37:46.590
They're pulling it in
toward a docking port

37:46.664 --> 37:48.188
along the central radius.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.358
500 meters...

37:49.433 --> 37:50.764
200...

37:50.868 --> 37:52.802
They're dropping shields.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.838
Energize.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.103
They're in.

38:00.211 --> 38:01.508
Biodampeners are stable.

38:01.545 --> 38:02.978
They're as good as invisible.

38:03.047 --> 38:04.139
The sphere?

38:04.215 --> 38:06.445
The shields are back up.

38:06.517 --> 38:08.075
They're assimilating
the shuttle.

38:08.152 --> 38:10.143
Keep a sensor lock
on the away team.

38:10.221 --> 38:11.279
Maintain course.

38:47.124 --> 38:51.060
Never forget who you are.

38:51.128 --> 38:53.221
Seven...

38:54.298 --> 38:55.526
Are you all right?

38:56.901 --> 38:58.027
Proceed.

39:04.408 --> 39:06.706
Primary shield generator--
got it.

39:06.777 --> 39:09.803
Spatial charges--
here, there and there.

39:48.119 --> 39:50.485
Tuvok to Janeway.
Charges set.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.647
Returning
to transport coordinates.

39:53.624 --> 39:55.421
The transwarp coil is off-line.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.484
Tuvok, now.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.223
Activate the charges.

40:02.633 --> 40:05.033
Their shields are down.

40:05.136 --> 40:08.469
Lock onto the coil and energize.

40:10.841 --> 40:12.638
Target obtained.

40:26.524 --> 40:29.049
Seven of Nine...

40:30.428 --> 40:31.952
Seven, keep moving!

40:34.198 --> 40:35.460
No.

40:35.533 --> 40:37.467
l wish to stay.

40:38.969 --> 40:41.938
l intend to rejoin
the collective.

40:42.006 --> 40:43.439
l can't let you do that.

40:43.507 --> 40:45.566
You have no choice.

40:46.744 --> 40:47.711
Keep moving.

40:47.812 --> 40:48.904
That's an order.

40:50.948 --> 40:52.176
Go!

40:52.249 --> 40:54.183
Chakotay to away team.

40:54.251 --> 40:55.582
The sphere
has detected Voyager.

40:55.653 --> 40:57.120
They've altered course
to intercept

40:57.188 --> 40:58.416
and they're charging weapons.

40:58.489 --> 41:00.047
We've got to get you
out of there now.

41:00.157 --> 41:01.920
400,000 kilometers and closing.

41:01.959 --> 41:04.189
Full power to weapons.

41:04.261 --> 41:06.161
l'm not leaving without you.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.198
Then you will be assimilated.

41:28.419 --> 41:30.410
They can see us.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.581
How?

41:32.656 --> 41:34.146
l don't know.

41:46.570 --> 41:47.628
Bridge, we're in position.

41:47.738 --> 41:48.670
Three to beam up.

41:48.739 --> 41:49.671
Three?

41:49.740 --> 41:51.207
Energize!

41:57.081 --> 41:58.241
Where's Seven?

41:58.315 --> 42:00.078
She had a change of heart.
Report.

42:00.184 --> 42:01.310
The sphere's changing course.

42:01.352 --> 42:02.341
They're retreating.

42:02.419 --> 42:04.284
They're bringing their remaining
transwarp coils on-line.

42:04.355 --> 42:05.287
Pursuit course.

42:05.356 --> 42:07.415
Target their propulsion system.

42:15.633 --> 42:17.294
They're gone, Captain.

44:37.841 --> 44:39.308
Welcome home.

44:50.287 --> 44:52.255
You've changed.

44:53.457 --> 44:55.357
Your exo-plating...

44:55.426 --> 44:58.224
your ocular implant.

44:58.295 --> 45:01.423
They've taken you apart...

45:02.499 --> 45:05.957
and they've re-created
you in their own image.

45:09.973 --> 45:13.909
Hair... garments...

45:13.977 --> 45:18.641
but at the core,
you are still mine.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.980
The Borg have changed as well.

45:21.051 --> 45:23.952
l expected reassimilation,
not conversation.

45:24.021 --> 45:27.047
l see they've also given you
a sense of humor.

45:27.124 --> 45:29.058
My humor is my own.

45:29.126 --> 45:32.152
Spoken like a true individual.

45:34.264 --> 45:38.928
The last two years must have
been a remarkable experience.

45:42.773 --> 45:45.071
You are unique.

45:45.142 --> 45:48.475
My experience will add
to your perfection.

45:48.545 --> 45:50.035
Yes.

45:50.180 --> 45:52.944
That is why you removed me
from Voyager.

45:55.619 --> 45:58.782
That is why we put you there
in the first place.

45:58.856 --> 46:01.290
You believe that Voyager
liberated you

46:01.391 --> 46:03.552
from the collective.

46:03.594 --> 46:07.792
Did you really think we would
surrender you so easily?

46:07.865 --> 46:09.833
Explain.

46:12.069 --> 46:15.300
You must be tired.

46:15.405 --> 46:18.704
lt's time to regenerate.

46:18.776 --> 46:21.870
We've adapted an alcove
just for you.

46:22.946 --> 46:26.712
Go. lt will help
order your thoughts.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.753
When your cycle is complete,
we will continue

46:29.820 --> 46:31.617
our conversation.

46:34.358 --> 46:35.484
Comply.

47:08.792 --> 47:10.259
Progress?

47:10.327 --> 47:11.555
We were having trouble

47:11.628 --> 47:13.789
modulating the coil
to our warp field.

47:13.864 --> 47:17.300
But l had an inspiration
this morning.

47:17.401 --> 47:21.303
lnstead of trying to adapt
the coil to our technology,

47:21.371 --> 47:23.896
we should be adapting
our systems to theirs.

47:24.007 --> 47:27.909
With any luck, we should have
transwarp capability by 0600.

47:27.978 --> 47:28.910
lmpressive.

47:28.979 --> 47:30.310
Actually l can't
take all the credit.

47:30.380 --> 47:32.610
l did some digging in Seven
of Nine's personal database

47:32.683 --> 47:35.015
and l found some designs
she'd been working on

47:35.085 --> 47:36.450
to enhance the warp drive.

47:36.520 --> 47:39.011
With a few adjustments...

47:39.089 --> 47:40.784
Work with Mr. Paris
on a flight plan.

47:40.858 --> 47:43.326
l want to make our first
trial run tomorrow afternoon.

47:43.393 --> 47:44.758
Right.

47:44.828 --> 47:45.920
And B'Elanna...

47:47.698 --> 47:50.997
don't access personal databases
without my authorization.

47:51.168 --> 47:52.601
Captain?

47:52.669 --> 47:55.866
There are protocols for
observing privacy on this ship.

47:57.107 --> 48:01.601
No offense, but Seven of Nine's
not on this ship anymore.

48:01.678 --> 48:05.546
l realize the two of you
weren't exactly close.

48:05.616 --> 48:09.177
Regardless, we just lost
one of our own.

48:09.253 --> 48:12.120
She was never
one of our own, Captain.

48:12.189 --> 48:14.487
Didn't she just prove that?

48:14.558 --> 48:17.288
l don't know what happened
on that sphere,

48:17.361 --> 48:20.228
and neither do you, Lieutenant.

48:20.297 --> 48:21.525
Carry on.

48:33.510 --> 48:35.273
No sign of Borg activity.

48:35.345 --> 48:36.369
We made a clean getaway.

48:36.446 --> 48:37.378
The sphere?

48:37.447 --> 48:39.381
lt hasn't shown up
on long-range sensors

48:39.449 --> 48:40.916
or subspace telemetry.

48:40.984 --> 48:42.645
lt could be anywhere
in the Quadrant by now.

48:42.719 --> 48:44.346
Launch a class-5 probe.

48:44.421 --> 48:46.389
Scan for residual
transwarp signatures.

48:46.456 --> 48:47.582
Understood.

48:49.326 --> 48:52.124
Why choose this moment
to rejoin the collective?

48:52.195 --> 48:55.392
Maybe she'd been
planning it all along.

48:55.465 --> 48:56.864
She's had any number
of opportunities

48:56.934 --> 48:58.629
to leave before now.

48:58.735 --> 49:01.135
But never direct access
to a Borg vessel.

49:01.238 --> 49:03.536
''l will betray you.''

49:03.607 --> 49:05.939
That's what she said
two years ago

49:06.009 --> 49:07.909
when you disconnected
her from the hive.

49:07.978 --> 49:09.809
Two days ago, she told me

49:09.880 --> 49:12.178
Voyager had become
her collective.

49:12.249 --> 49:14.513
Captain...
we've cleared out

49:14.584 --> 49:16.518
most of the debris,
but before we vaporize it,

49:16.586 --> 49:18.383
l'd like to melt down
the larger fragments

49:18.455 --> 49:20.252
and extract
the polytrinic compounds.

49:20.324 --> 49:21.222
Makes sense.

49:21.291 --> 49:24.089
That leaves just one item--

49:24.161 --> 49:26.095
Seven of Nine's alcove.

49:26.163 --> 49:29.621
lt requires a lot of power--
over 30 megawatts.

49:32.035 --> 49:33.434
Should l deactivate it?

49:34.705 --> 49:36.400
No, leave it alone.

49:52.322 --> 49:54.290
Computer,
isolate the sensor readings

49:54.358 --> 49:56.952
for time index 1 14.6.

49:57.027 --> 49:58.756
ldentify source.

49:58.829 --> 50:02.697
Random subspace
energy fluctuations.

50:02.766 --> 50:08.227
lsolate the sensor readings
for time index 166.2. Source?

50:08.305 --> 50:12.241
Random subspace
energy fluctuations.

50:12.309 --> 50:14.971
Computer,
run a transpectral analysis

50:15.045 --> 50:17.707
on all subspace fluctuations.

50:18.882 --> 50:19.849
Yes?

50:21.284 --> 50:24.219
A member of the crew
has requested an appointment

50:24.287 --> 50:25.379
with the Captain.

50:25.455 --> 50:26.387
l informed her

50:26.456 --> 50:28.754
that you were occupied,
but she was insistent.

50:28.825 --> 50:31.020
Whatever it is,
l'm sure Commander Chakotay

50:31.094 --> 50:32.425
can handle...

50:36.967 --> 50:39.561
Request granted.
Send her in.

50:43.573 --> 50:46.440
Permission to submit a proposal
for your review.

50:46.510 --> 50:47.772
Proposal?

50:47.844 --> 50:51.075
lt's a rescue operation
for Seven of Nine.

50:54.418 --> 50:55.578
Oh...

50:56.987 --> 50:59.751
You created this plan
all by yourself?

50:59.823 --> 51:01.222
Yes, ma'am.

51:01.324 --> 51:03.849
You see, if we change
our long-range sensors

51:03.894 --> 51:05.987
to Seven's
cortical implant frequency,

51:06.096 --> 51:07.688
maybe we can find her.

51:10.267 --> 51:12.360
The Delta Quadrant
is a very big place

51:12.469 --> 51:15.529
and Seven could be thousands
of light-years from here.

51:17.941 --> 51:20.136
What if we boosted
our sensor range

51:20.210 --> 51:22.440
with power
from the main deflector?

51:23.914 --> 51:27.975
You've been spending
too much time in Engineering.

51:28.051 --> 51:30.884
l'm afraid
it's not quite that simple,

51:30.954 --> 51:32.888
but thank you, crewman.

51:32.956 --> 51:35.720
Your initiative is duly noted.

51:38.361 --> 51:39.419
Captain?

51:40.831 --> 51:43.095
You're not going
to give up, are you?

51:51.708 --> 51:53.437
There are three things
to remember

51:53.510 --> 51:55.137
about being a Starship Captain--

51:55.212 --> 51:56.804
keep your shirt tucked in,

51:56.880 --> 51:59.075
go down with the ship...

52:00.717 --> 52:04.414
and never abandon
a member of your crew.

52:06.623 --> 52:09.717
Transpectral analysis complete.

52:10.927 --> 52:12.417
Take a look at this, Naomi.

52:12.496 --> 52:14.760
What do you see?

52:14.831 --> 52:16.162
Sensor logs.

52:16.233 --> 52:20.567
These aren't random
energy fluctuations.

52:20.670 --> 52:22.035
They're Borg com signals

52:22.172 --> 52:25.141
and they were all
directed at Cargo Bay 2.

52:25.208 --> 52:28.268
You mean the Borg were
talking to Seven of Nine?

52:28.345 --> 52:30.404
lt sure looks that way.
Come on.

52:44.794 --> 52:46.785
Good morning.

52:48.865 --> 52:52.096
My visual cortex...
it's been altered.

52:52.202 --> 52:56.036
We've enhanced it
with Borg technology.

52:56.106 --> 53:00.202
You've seen through
human eyes long enough.

53:00.277 --> 53:02.245
lt's a neural processing adjunct

53:02.312 --> 53:05.145
designed to increase
your synaptic efficiency.

53:05.215 --> 53:07.115
Remove it.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.709
You prefer to remain small.

53:09.786 --> 53:11.845
l prefer to remain unique.

53:12.923 --> 53:14.413
Don't be afraid.

53:15.458 --> 53:17.983
We won't turn you into a drone.

53:18.094 --> 53:22.622
You're much too valuable to us
with your individuality intact,

53:22.699 --> 53:25.327
but you've left humanity behind.

53:25.435 --> 53:30.372
Try to abandon
their petty emotions as well.

53:30.440 --> 53:35.844
Fear... anger... vanity.

53:37.614 --> 53:40.606
They've corrupted you...

53:40.684 --> 53:43.744
but the damage can be repaired.

53:45.288 --> 53:49.019
You've expended significant
resources to capture me.

53:49.092 --> 53:50.354
Why?

53:50.427 --> 53:53.555
lsn't it obvious?

53:53.630 --> 53:56.793
You're going to help us
assimilate humanity.

53:56.866 --> 53:59.426
We failed in our first attempt

53:59.536 --> 54:02.300
to assimilate Earth and we
won't succeed the next time

54:02.405 --> 54:05.397
unless we understand
the nature of their resistance.

54:05.475 --> 54:09.639
We want you to be our eyes.

54:09.713 --> 54:12.614
Let us see humanity.

54:14.150 --> 54:18.177
While l was regenerating,
you assimilated my memories.

54:18.255 --> 54:20.416
Our thoughts are one.

54:20.490 --> 54:22.856
Then you already possess
all of my knowledge.

54:22.926 --> 54:24.086
What more do you want?

54:24.160 --> 54:25.525
You are the only Borg

54:25.595 --> 54:29.395
that has ever returned
to a state of individuality.

54:29.466 --> 54:32.560
We want to keep you
exactly the way you are.

54:32.669 --> 54:36.765
Otherwise, you would lose
your human perspective.

54:36.873 --> 54:40.309
We don't want another drone.

54:40.377 --> 54:42.641
We want you.

54:44.314 --> 54:46.305
l will resist.

54:47.917 --> 54:49.384
l know.

54:52.756 --> 54:54.053
What's happening?

54:54.157 --> 54:57.649
Our vessel is disengaging
from the Unicomplex.

54:57.727 --> 55:00.594
We're setting a course
for grid 532.

55:00.697 --> 55:03.495
State our purpose.

55:03.533 --> 55:05.694
Assimilation.

55:05.802 --> 55:08.737
Our presence is not required,

55:08.805 --> 55:10.329
but l thought the experience
would be

55:10.440 --> 55:12.840
a rewarding one for you.

55:19.649 --> 55:23.551
Species 10026.

55:23.620 --> 55:26.646
How many life-forms?

55:26.723 --> 55:28.520
392,000.

55:30.126 --> 55:33.186
You're experiencing compassion--

55:33.263 --> 55:35.857
a human impulse.

55:35.932 --> 55:39.265
You've forgotten
what it means to be Borg.

55:39.369 --> 55:42.805
Those lives will be added
to our own.

55:58.455 --> 56:01.447
Field notes, USS Raven,
supplemental.

56:01.558 --> 56:03.185
lt's been a busy week.

56:03.226 --> 56:04.989
The cube linked
with another Borg vessel

56:05.128 --> 56:07.392
and received
over 50,000 new drones.

56:07.464 --> 56:10.456
We now begin the dangerous task
of identifying the newcomers.

56:11.568 --> 56:14.093
Species 6961...

56:14.204 --> 56:15.694
Ktarian.

56:15.805 --> 56:18.273
Tritanium infrastructure.

56:18.375 --> 56:20.809
He's a tactical drone.

56:20.877 --> 56:23.937
Take a look
at his proximity transceiver.

56:24.013 --> 56:26.538
Let's check
his previous designation.

56:26.616 --> 56:28.345
Three of Five.

56:28.418 --> 56:31.854
Tertiary Adjunct of...

56:31.921 --> 56:34.185
Unimatrix One.

56:36.459 --> 56:38.825
l want to keep an eye
on this one.

56:38.895 --> 56:40.624
Let's tag him.

56:40.697 --> 56:43.689
Bring me the subdermal probe,
will you?

56:43.767 --> 56:44.995
ls he special?

56:45.101 --> 56:46.193
Very special.

56:46.302 --> 56:49.669
We think he used to work
near the Borg queen.

56:49.739 --> 56:51.707
lf he ever goes back there...

56:51.775 --> 56:53.936
we'll be able to track him now.

56:54.010 --> 56:55.944
Does the queen have a throne?

56:56.012 --> 56:57.036
Nobody knows.

56:57.147 --> 57:00.674
We think she's more like
the queen of an insect colony.

57:00.784 --> 57:02.718
She helps coordinate
all the other drones.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.180
His regeneration cycle's
almost complete.

57:06.256 --> 57:07.484
We better get him back.

57:12.262 --> 57:13.388
Bye.

57:16.699 --> 57:18.132
He's in his alcove.

57:18.234 --> 57:19.792
Nobody missed him.

57:19.903 --> 57:21.461
Enough drones for one day.

57:21.571 --> 57:23.004
Anybody hungry?

57:23.072 --> 57:24.004
Me.

57:24.073 --> 57:25.097
You two go ahead.

57:25.208 --> 57:28.177
l want to read through his
cranial transceiver logs,

57:28.244 --> 57:29.336
see if he was ever

57:29.412 --> 57:31.175
in direct contact
with the queen.

57:31.247 --> 57:32.874
Don't be long.

57:43.293 --> 57:45.193
lt turns out
his hunch was right--

57:45.261 --> 57:47.286
the drone had been receiving
direct commands

57:47.363 --> 57:49.092
from this... Borg queen.

57:49.165 --> 57:50.598
l analyzed the com signals.

57:50.667 --> 57:52.897
Look at the transpectral
frequencies.

57:54.003 --> 57:56.699
They match the ones
that were sent to Seven.

57:56.806 --> 58:00.242
What did the Hansens learn
about this queen?

58:00.343 --> 58:02.208
l'm afraid they never got
a chance to find out.

58:02.278 --> 58:04.974
One thing is certain,
she contacted Seven of Nine,

58:05.114 --> 58:07.708
and the next day,
Seven rejoined the Borg.

58:07.784 --> 58:10.685
Obviously,
she exerts some influence.

58:10.753 --> 58:12.778
You think Seven was instructed
to leave Voyager?.

58:12.856 --> 58:14.187
lnstructed...

58:14.257 --> 58:16.851
coerced.

58:16.926 --> 58:18.951
She insisted
she join the away team.

58:19.028 --> 58:21.462
She was adamant that if she
didn't board that sphere,

58:21.531 --> 58:22.964
our mission would fail.

58:23.032 --> 58:25.227
Sounds to me like she
was being threatened.

58:25.335 --> 58:27.633
My instincts told me she was
holding something back,

58:27.737 --> 58:28.897
but l...

58:29.005 --> 58:31.735
l didn't pursue it.

58:31.808 --> 58:33.173
l let her go.

58:33.243 --> 58:35.768
lf you hadn't,
we might all be drones by now.

58:39.015 --> 58:41.813
What's running through
that collective mind of yours?

58:41.885 --> 58:44.615
You've got thousands of species
to choose from,

58:44.687 --> 58:46.052
billions of individuals.

58:46.122 --> 58:48.147
Why Seven of Nine?

58:48.224 --> 58:51.318
You should've assimilated us
while you had the chance.

58:51.394 --> 58:52.952
Captain?

58:54.898 --> 58:57.890
l want you to keep analyzing
the Hansens' database.

58:58.001 --> 59:01.061
Compile a list
of every technology they created

59:01.170 --> 59:02.728
to track the Borg.

59:02.839 --> 59:04.932
Assemble a team of engineers
to assist you.

59:05.041 --> 59:06.508
lf you're planning
a rescue mission,

59:06.576 --> 59:08.737
that research
will only take us so far.

59:08.811 --> 59:09.869
Oh?

59:09.946 --> 59:12.073
l've studied their log entries
long enough to realize

59:12.148 --> 59:14.139
that as brilliant
as the Hansens were,

59:14.217 --> 59:16.151
they made a fatal mistake.

59:16.219 --> 59:18.585
They became overconfident.

59:18.655 --> 59:20.782
We won't make the same mistake.

59:29.365 --> 59:32.823
This will be a long-range
tactical rescue.

59:32.936 --> 59:34.631
lt could take days, even weeks,

59:34.737 --> 59:36.705
before we find
our missing crewman.

59:36.806 --> 59:38.899
Lieutenant Torres is equipping
the Delta Flyer

59:39.008 --> 59:40.737
with the transwarp coil.

59:40.810 --> 59:43.005
lt'll allow us
to cover more territory.

59:43.079 --> 59:45.138
An away team will take it
into transwarp space,

59:45.214 --> 59:47.148
where Tuvok believes
we can track the sphere

59:47.216 --> 59:48.877
that abducted Seven of Nine.

59:48.952 --> 59:50.852
Thanks to the Hansens, we'll be

59:50.920 --> 59:52.888
well-prepared
for an encounter with the Borg.

59:52.956 --> 59:55.390
Their multiadaptive shielding
will make the Flyer

59:55.458 --> 59:58.086
virtually invisible
to Borg sensors,

59:58.161 --> 59:59.287
and narrow-beam transporters

59:59.362 --> 01:00:01.592
will allow us
to penetrate the sphere.

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:03.325
Mr. Paris, you'll man the helm.

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:04.866
Commander Tuvok, tactical.

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:06.868
Doctor, there's no telling
what condition

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:08.267
Seven will be in
when we find her.

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:09.270
You'll come along.

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:10.271
Yes, Captain.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.864
l'll be leading the away team.

01:00:11.975 --> 01:00:13.738
The rest of you will
remain on Voyager

01:00:13.810 --> 01:00:14.777
and maintain position

01:00:14.844 --> 01:00:17.312
at the threshold
of our transwarp conduit.

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.575
We may need tactical support
when we return.

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:22.743
You'll be taking your orders
from Commander Chakotay.

01:00:22.819 --> 01:00:25.652
We'll be searching
for one individual

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.587
among thousands of drones...

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.758
But she's one of us...

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:33.159
and l'm not about to let her go.

01:00:33.229 --> 01:00:35.595
Let's get started.

01:00:42.105 --> 01:00:43.572
All systems go.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:46.108
We're ready for the jump.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.301
Bring the coil on line.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.605
Prepare for transwarp.

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.809
Power output fluctuating.

01:00:52.882 --> 01:00:54.008
Compensating.

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:57.181
We're at critical velocity.

01:00:57.253 --> 01:00:59.187
Engage, Mr. Paris.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.621
Transwarp in four...

01:01:01.724 --> 01:01:02.986
three...

01:01:03.026 --> 01:01:04.391
two...

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:16.933
We've crossed the threshold.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.440
Steady as she goes.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.668
Doctor...

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.179
are you all right?

01:01:25.248 --> 01:01:27.148
Just a little motion sickness.

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.047
l'll need to adjust my matrix

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.484
to accommodate
for extreme velocity.

01:01:31.554 --> 01:01:34.887
l'm detecting
residual transwarp signatures.

01:01:34.957 --> 01:01:36.447
They match the Borg sphere.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.720
Adjust our course and follow it,

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.352
Mr. Paris.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:46.391
l believe the Captain's order
was ''steady as she goes.''

01:01:48.271 --> 01:01:49.568
Full speed ahead.

01:02:02.318 --> 01:02:04.513
We've arrived.

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:06.851
Are you ready?

01:02:06.923 --> 01:02:09.653
l have familiarized
myself with the species.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:10.988
Tactical weakness?

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:13.528
Their vessels lack
maneuverability.

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:14.893
Tactical strength?

01:02:14.964 --> 01:02:17.159
They've developed
a modulating phaser pulse

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:18.825
that can penetrate our shields.

01:02:18.935 --> 01:02:21.130
How do you propose we adapt?

01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:23.137
You are the Borg.

01:02:23.206 --> 01:02:24.605
You tell me.

01:02:26.042 --> 01:02:29.478
39 of their vessels
are converging on our position.

01:02:29.545 --> 01:02:31.206
They're firing weapons.

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:35.278
Our shields are failing.

01:02:35.351 --> 01:02:37.717
We will be destroyed.

01:02:37.787 --> 01:02:39.687
How do you propose we adapt?

01:02:44.927 --> 01:02:48.693
Triaxillate our shield geometry
to absorb their phaser pulses.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.791
l was thinking the same thing.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.766
Adaptation complete.

01:02:57.874 --> 01:03:01.207
They're no longer a threat.

01:03:01.310 --> 01:03:03.778
Go to the primary
assimilation chamber.

01:03:03.813 --> 01:03:06.748
You'll monitor
the bio-extraction process.

01:03:09.152 --> 01:03:11.211
You look reluctant.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:15.682
Maybe l've been
pushing you too quickly.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.587
You can assist with the repairs
to our shield matrix instead.

01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:26.365
Seven of Nine...

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.473
be efficient.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.319
Assist me.

01:05:59.388 --> 01:06:00.980
l am not Borg.

01:06:01.123 --> 01:06:03.387
l will help you escape.

01:06:03.459 --> 01:06:05.086
Assist me.

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:12.995
l'm detecting
one of your vessels.

01:06:13.135 --> 01:06:14.363
lt's heavily damaged.

01:06:14.470 --> 01:06:15.459
The crew is dead.

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.732
The Borg are ignoring it.

01:06:21.610 --> 01:06:23.703
lts propulsion system
is still functioning.

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:25.178
l will transport you aboard.

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:27.181
Remain there
until the Borg leave orbit.

01:06:27.249 --> 01:06:30.218
Then set a course on a heading
of 121 mark 9.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.083
Do you understand?

01:06:58.414 --> 01:07:00.109
Congratulations.

01:07:01.517 --> 01:07:03.109
Regarding?

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:05.244
Assimilation is complete.

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.312
300,000 individuals

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.450
have been transformed
into drones.

01:07:10.526 --> 01:07:13.495
Should they be congratulated
as well?

01:07:13.562 --> 01:07:15.154
They should be.

01:07:15.231 --> 01:07:18.394
They've left behind their
trivial, selfish lives

01:07:18.501 --> 01:07:21.993
and they've been reborn
with a greater purpose.

01:07:22.104 --> 01:07:27.007
We've delivered them
from chaos... into order.

01:07:27.076 --> 01:07:28.668
Comforting words.

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:31.907
Use them next time instead
of ''resistance is futile.''

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:33.846
You may elicit
a few volunteers.

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.349
You cling to sarcasm

01:07:35.418 --> 01:07:38.285
because you are afraid
to see the truth.

01:07:38.354 --> 01:07:41.221
Species 10026

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:43.724
is already adding
to our perfection.

01:07:43.793 --> 01:07:46.819
You can feel
their distinctiveness coursing

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:49.057
through us...

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:51.122
enhancing us.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.497
Stop resisting.

01:07:54.570 --> 01:07:56.401
Take pleasure in this.

01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.808
l will not take pleasure
in the destruction of a race.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:03.470
Human sentiment...

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:05.377
compassion...

01:08:05.448 --> 01:08:07.473
guilt... empathy...

01:08:07.550 --> 01:08:08.482
they're irrelevant.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:10.143
Not to me.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.151
''Me''?

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.949
There is no me.

01:08:13.022 --> 01:08:15.286
There is only us...

01:08:15.357 --> 01:08:16.688
one mind.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:19.227
My thoughts are my own.

01:08:21.529 --> 01:08:23.327
We've overlooked something--

01:08:24.867 --> 01:08:26.357
a ship...

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:30.394
four life-forms.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:33.031
They're trying to escape.

01:08:35.176 --> 01:08:38.544
How do you suggest we proceed?

01:08:38.613 --> 01:08:40.548
Destroy the vessel

01:08:40.616 --> 01:08:42.243
or assimilate it?

01:08:44.252 --> 01:08:45.515
Neither.

01:08:45.587 --> 01:08:47.555
There are only four life-forms

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.853
and the vessel
is heavily damaged.

01:08:49.925 --> 01:08:53.156
lt would be an inefficient
use of our resources.

01:08:53.229 --> 01:08:54.627
We should ignore it.

01:08:56.232 --> 01:08:59.133
ln this case,
our thoughts are not one.

01:08:59.234 --> 01:09:02.398
lf those individuals
are allowed to survive,

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:06.839
Species 10026 will survive
and continue to resist us...

01:09:06.908 --> 01:09:10.504
but that's what you were
hoping for, wasn't it?

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:16.578
You tried to mask
their life signs...

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.779
but l detected them.

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:26.287
Release the vessel.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:29.819
l'm sorry this lesson has
to be so painful for you,

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:31.957
but you are a difficult pupil.

01:09:32.067 --> 01:09:34.035
Abandon your human frailties.

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:36.298
They are the cause of your pain.

01:09:39.341 --> 01:09:41.901
Let them go.

01:09:41.977 --> 01:09:43.238
Please.

01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.124
l thought compassion
was irrelevant.

01:10:19.114 --> 01:10:23.050
Field notes, USS Raven,
Stardate 32634.9.

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:25.450
The Raven was hit
by a subspace particle storm.

01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.455
We took heavy damage and
our multiadaptive shielding

01:10:27.523 --> 01:10:29.787
went off-line for 13.2 seconds.

01:10:29.858 --> 01:10:31.485
Unfortunately,
it was long enough

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:33.391
for the Borg to perceive us
as a threat.

01:10:33.462 --> 01:10:35.657
l found something-- a nebula.

01:10:35.731 --> 01:10:36.459
Class?

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:38.295
Mutara.
Distance: three light-years.

01:10:38.367 --> 01:10:40.198
l'm setting a course.

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:41.860
The particle density's too high.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:42.733
Our hull would breach.

01:10:42.838 --> 01:10:44.100
We can reinforce
structural integrity.

01:10:44.173 --> 01:10:45.231
We'll find somewhere else
to hide.

01:10:45.341 --> 01:10:46.330
There's no time.

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:47.966
lt's been three hours

01:10:48.077 --> 01:10:49.669
and the cube
hasn't found us yet.

01:10:49.745 --> 01:10:52.043
As long as we can keep
masking our warp trail...

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.046
The entire collective
knows about us by now.

01:10:54.149 --> 01:10:55.411
They'll send more ships.

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:56.883
The nebula's too dangerous!

01:10:56.952 --> 01:10:59.352
We've had close calls before.

01:10:59.421 --> 01:11:01.116
This is no different.

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:03.589
Remember when
the transporters failed?

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:05.355
And you had to spend the night

01:11:05.427 --> 01:11:08.362
in the maturation chamber
with 52 neonatal drones?

01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:14.331
A transwarp conduit,
2.3 light-years starboard.

01:11:14.436 --> 01:11:17.428
lt's a cube
heading right for us.

01:11:17.539 --> 01:11:19.006
Time to intercept?

01:11:19.141 --> 01:11:20.972
One hour, maybe less.

01:11:21.043 --> 01:11:22.237
Papa?

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.677
Be right there, Annika.

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:27.238
Start looking
for an M-Class planet.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:30.308
We'll abandon ship
if we have to.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:36.648
Hey.

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:39.626
Are we going to be a-simulated?

01:11:39.695 --> 01:11:42.357
Not if l can help it.

01:11:42.431 --> 01:11:44.058
Go back to sleep.

01:11:44.133 --> 01:11:45.862
Your mother and l
have work to do.

01:11:45.934 --> 01:11:47.925
Are the Borg mad at us?

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.470
No.

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:51.631
Then why are they chasing
our ship?

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.469
They're curious about us...

01:11:53.542 --> 01:11:55.601
like we are about them,

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.441
but don't worry.

01:11:57.513 --> 01:11:59.947
We won't let them get too close.

01:12:00.015 --> 01:12:01.380
l want to go home.

01:12:01.483 --> 01:12:03.280
Soon.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:09.958
Papa?

01:12:11.694 --> 01:12:14.060
Will it hurt to be a drone?

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.620
Sleep.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:34.539
Captain.

01:12:34.616 --> 01:12:35.674
Hmm?

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:37.719
l'd like to suggest
a few modifications

01:12:37.786 --> 01:12:38.718
to the com array.

01:12:38.787 --> 01:12:39.845
Yes?

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.651
l've been studying
Seven's cranial schematics,

01:12:41.724 --> 01:12:44.352
and l've isolated the frequency
of her interplexing beacon.

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:46.189
When we catch up
with the sphere,

01:12:46.261 --> 01:12:48.161
we might be able
to send her a brief message.

01:12:48.230 --> 01:12:50.790
What if she's already been
linked to the hive mind?

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:53.630
Every drone has
its own translink signature.

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:56.500
Only Seven will be able
to hear our message.

01:12:56.605 --> 01:12:59.039
l'll give you a hand.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:05.346
The Hansen diaries--

01:13:05.414 --> 01:13:06.904
not exactly light reading.

01:13:06.982 --> 01:13:08.847
l've been poring over
their last log entries

01:13:08.917 --> 01:13:10.509
for any details
we might have missed.

01:13:10.586 --> 01:13:13.282
l want to make sure history
doesn't repeat itself.

01:13:13.355 --> 01:13:15.323
They should have quit
while they were ahead.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:18.360
Ten million teraquads of data,
three years in the wild.

01:13:18.427 --> 01:13:21.328
They could have studied the Borg
for another three decades

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.331
and still have barely
scratched the surface.

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.765
l agree their methods
were unorthodox,

01:13:25.868 --> 01:13:28.803
but that's been true
of most great explorers.

01:13:28.871 --> 01:13:30.304
Most explorers don't take

01:13:30.372 --> 01:13:32.431
their four-year-old daughter
along for the ride.

01:13:32.541 --> 01:13:34.441
We'll get her back, Doctor...

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.569
with her parents' help.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:41.273
Captain, l've got a fix
on the sphere's location.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.410
lt's in a region
about 200 light-years from here.

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:46.954
Red Alert. Bring the multi-
adaptive shielding on line.

01:13:47.022 --> 01:13:48.819
Set a course
for those coordinates,

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:50.222
and prepare to disengage

01:13:50.292 --> 01:13:52.089
transwarp drive.

01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:03.164
Report.

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.763
l'm detecting thousands
of integrated substructures,

01:14:05.874 --> 01:14:07.307
trillions of life-forms...

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:08.468
all Borg.

01:14:08.544 --> 01:14:11.342
There's a cube coming up fast
off our port bow.

01:14:15.584 --> 01:14:16.881
Did they detect us?

01:14:16.952 --> 01:14:18.852
l don't believe so.

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.718
Any sign of our sphere?

01:14:20.789 --> 01:14:22.222
Yes, ma'am.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:26.352
lts ion signature leads directly
to that... whatever it is.

01:14:26.428 --> 01:14:27.918
Take us in, Mr. Paris.

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.258
Minimum thrusters.

01:14:29.331 --> 01:14:31.595
Begin scanning for Seven, Tuvok.

01:14:31.667 --> 01:14:33.328
Aye, Captain.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:39.601
l have a task for you.

01:14:39.675 --> 01:14:44.044
We're planning to deploy
a new mode of assimilation,

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:47.012
designed for highly
resistant species.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:50.381
l want you to program
the nanoprobes.

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:53.512
Your technology has changed
since l left the collective.

01:14:53.589 --> 01:14:56.319
My knowledge is insufficient.

01:14:56.391 --> 01:15:01.260
Your knowledge for the target
species is invaluable.

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:03.695
Species 5618.

01:15:03.732 --> 01:15:07.429
Human. Warp-capable.

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.197
Origin: Grid 325.

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:11.431
Physiology: lnefficient.

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.509
Below-average cranial capacity.

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:17.170
Minimal redundant systems.

01:15:17.246 --> 01:15:19.874
Limited regenerative abilities.

01:15:19.948 --> 01:15:22.576
Our previous attempts
to assimilate them

01:15:22.651 --> 01:15:24.516
were all direct assaults.

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:26.053
They failed,

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:29.648
so we've created a more
surreptitious strategy.

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:32.660
You intend to detonate
a biogenic charge

01:15:32.728 --> 01:15:34.389
in Earth's atmosphere.

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:38.058
lt would infect all life-forms
with nanoprobe viruses.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:40.532
Assimilation would be gradual.

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:44.072
By the time they realized
what was happening,

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:47.107
half their population
would be drones.

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:48.972
lnefficient.

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:51.569
The virus would take
years to proliferate.

01:15:51.647 --> 01:15:54.445
We've waited this long.

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:58.776
lnterface
with the central alcove.

01:15:58.854 --> 01:16:01.322
Begin programming
the nanoprobes.

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:05.883
Be sure to enhance
the viral sequencers.

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:09.557
You've been involved
in hundreds of assimilations.

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.223
This is no different.

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:12.995
To you, perhaps.

01:16:13.168 --> 01:16:14.635
Part of me is still human.

01:16:14.736 --> 01:16:17.034
l will not assist
in their destruction.

01:16:17.105 --> 01:16:20.632
We all originated
from lesser species.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:23.575
l myself came from Species 125,

01:16:23.645 --> 01:16:25.670
but that's irrelevant now.

01:16:25.747 --> 01:16:27.305
We are Borg.

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:29.976
l am an individual.

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:32.282
You're only repeating
their words.

01:16:32.354 --> 01:16:34.845
You sound like
a mindless automaton.

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:39.826
Comply or we will
turn you into a drone.

01:16:40.896 --> 01:16:44.161
Proceed if you wish.

01:16:48.537 --> 01:16:53.270
You're torn between your desire
to be one with us,

01:16:53.342 --> 01:16:55.708
and your loyalty to them.

01:16:55.777 --> 01:16:59.713
lt's time for you
to complete your task.

01:17:03.218 --> 01:17:09.646
All of your emotions--
grief, guilt,

01:17:09.725 --> 01:17:13.855
remorse, compassion--

01:17:13.929 --> 01:17:18.662
will be irrelevant
once humanity is assimilated.

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.463
Forget Voyager.

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:24.198
They were never your collective.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:27.537
l am Annika Hansen, human.

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:29.702
l remember Annika.

01:17:31.346 --> 01:17:33.337
Does she remember us?

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.377
She wasn't afraid.

01:17:38.453 --> 01:17:40.887
Why are you?

01:17:42.257 --> 01:17:46.956
You attacked us.

01:17:47.029 --> 01:17:48.519
You murdered my family!

01:17:48.597 --> 01:17:50.258
We did no such thing.

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:52.892
We gave them perfection.

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.669
Papa?

01:18:02.744 --> 01:18:04.609
Your family's here.

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.240
You're here.

01:18:10.085 --> 01:18:12.178
Be one with us again.

01:18:12.254 --> 01:18:14.586
Seven of Nine,
we're searching for you.

01:18:14.656 --> 01:18:16.089
Try to hang on.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:17.090
Captain.

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.059
What did you say?

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:23.426
Nothing.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.800
Janeway.

01:18:41.850 --> 01:18:44.045
Our transmission's
being deflected.

01:18:44.119 --> 01:18:45.586
By whom?

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:46.621
l'm not certain.

01:18:46.688 --> 01:18:48.622
l've isolated Seven's position.

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:50.851
She's inside
a large infrastructure,

01:18:50.926 --> 01:18:52.985
approximately
600 kilometers away.

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.392
Set a course, Mr. Paris.

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:57.859
She's close.

01:19:00.035 --> 01:19:03.368
Her com signal originated
within this spatial grid,

01:19:03.438 --> 01:19:07.306
but we can't detect her vessel.

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:11.807
He knows why.

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.871
Your father designed
the technology

01:19:13.949 --> 01:19:15.974
Captain Janeway's using--

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:18.178
multiadaptive shielding--

01:19:18.253 --> 01:19:21.279
your perfect defense
against the Borg,

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:25.292
but we assimilated
that knowledge, didn't we?

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:30.756
We will adapt easily.

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:36.835
A cube has altered course.

01:19:36.905 --> 01:19:38.463
lt's heading straight for us.

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:39.801
They've detected us.

01:19:39.875 --> 01:19:41.672
Remodulate the shields,
evasive maneuvers.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.551
lt flew right past us.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:52.814
We won't fool their sensors
much longer.

01:19:52.888 --> 01:19:53.820
Tuvok?

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.652
Seven is inside a large chamber.

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:57.157
Can you get a lock on her?

01:19:57.225 --> 01:19:58.783
Not at this distance.

01:19:58.860 --> 01:20:02.489
Take us
to within transporter range.

01:20:02.564 --> 01:20:07.729
We have their ship--
a Federation shuttlecraft--

01:20:07.836 --> 01:20:09.997
three life-forms, one hologram.

01:20:10.172 --> 01:20:14.040
lf you've captured their vessel,
you've assimilated them by now.

01:20:14.142 --> 01:20:17.043
l would sense their presence
in the collective.

01:20:17.145 --> 01:20:19.705
Captain Janeway is eluding you.

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:24.918
The chamber is
too heavily shielded.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:26.385
l can't get a lock on her.

01:20:26.454 --> 01:20:29.048
Can we beam into one of
these adjoining corridors?

01:20:29.191 --> 01:20:30.590
l believe so.

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.559
Time for the biodampeners.

01:20:32.627 --> 01:20:33.685
Tom, hold our position.

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:36.697
Target that chamber
with full weapons.

01:20:36.765 --> 01:20:39.063
Stand by to fire on my command.

01:20:39.201 --> 01:20:41.567
Ma'am, won't you be down there?

01:20:41.670 --> 01:20:43.228
Do it.

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.013
This way.

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:08.789
Try to locate the shield matrix.

01:21:10.332 --> 01:21:11.321
Tuvok?

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:15.735
l can disable the force field,

01:21:15.804 --> 01:21:17.396
but it will take
several minutes.

01:21:17.505 --> 01:21:18.472
Do it.

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:25.210
Tuvok, give me
the subdermal probe.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:31.481
lt's not too late to save them.

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:40.886
As you wish.

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:45.462
They've isolated
our shields again.

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:47.524
Three vessels are converging.

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.502
l'm remodulating.

01:21:56.778 --> 01:21:59.110
You underestimate them.

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:04.819
lt's time for a more
aggressive approach.

01:22:05.887 --> 01:22:07.411
l thought they couldn't see us.

01:22:07.489 --> 01:22:09.548
They can't.
They're firing blind.

01:22:14.062 --> 01:22:16.053
Wake him.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:24.534
lt's transmitting.

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:28.800
l've got it.

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:31.674
Field modulation is 324.95.

01:22:33.949 --> 01:22:35.041
Proceed.

01:22:36.618 --> 01:22:37.550
lt's off-line.

01:22:37.619 --> 01:22:38.551
You'll be detected.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:39.746
Then l'd better hurry.

01:22:39.821 --> 01:22:40.845
You've got to disable

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:43.550
the shield matrix
around that chamber.

01:22:45.293 --> 01:22:46.351
lt's no use.

01:22:46.428 --> 01:22:47.759
They've locked on
to our shield modulators.

01:22:47.829 --> 01:22:50.491
They're adapting the second
we change frequencies.

01:22:50.565 --> 01:22:53.159
We are the Borg.
You will be assimilated.

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:55.395
Resistance is futile.

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:00.468
You have failed them.

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.941
No.

01:23:04.212 --> 01:23:06.646
We believed you
would be an asset to us.

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:09.650
We were wrong.

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:10.810
You are weak.

01:23:10.885 --> 01:23:12.352
Don't listen to her, Seven.

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:14.149
She's irrelevant.

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:19.660
Call them off
or l'll destroy you.

01:23:26.801 --> 01:23:28.769
Your weapons are useless.

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:29.996
Don't be so sure.

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:34.337
My Tactical Officer is disabling
the shields around this room.

01:23:34.409 --> 01:23:35.341
Tom, status.

01:23:35.410 --> 01:23:38.345
We've targeted the chamber,
Captain.

01:23:38.413 --> 01:23:41.712
Let her go,
or l'll give the order to fire.

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:45.947
You would be destroyed as well,
along with your crewman.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:48.785
Better than being one of you.

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.957
Tom, high-yield torpedoes,
full spread.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.997
Fire on my command.

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:03.565
Captain, they've disengaged
the tractor.

01:24:03.671 --> 01:24:05.832
Hold your fire.
Beam us out of here.

01:24:08.576 --> 01:24:11.374
A dispersal field just activated
around the chamber you're in.

01:24:11.446 --> 01:24:13.573
We can't get a lock.

01:24:16.851 --> 01:24:20.651
Seven, shut down that field.

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.713
Don't listen to her.

01:24:22.791 --> 01:24:25.385
She's poisoned your thoughts
long enough.

01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:27.451
l'm giving you an order.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:29.793
One order, one voice.

01:24:29.864 --> 01:24:32.492
lnsignificant.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:46.975
Tom, energize.

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.685
She's adapting.

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:53.914
The field went up again,
Captain.

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:55.455
l can't beam you out.

01:24:55.523 --> 01:24:58.356
You will assist the collective
as drones.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:24:59.950
Assimilate them.

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:03.656
Captain, target the power node
directly above this alcove.

01:25:03.698 --> 01:25:05.723
lt will disrupt
her command interface.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:09.760
Our thoughts are one.

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:33.193
Welcome back.

01:25:35.463 --> 01:25:38.489
Three vessels closing fast.

01:25:39.601 --> 01:25:41.296
Direct hit
to our tactical array.

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:42.892
Weapons are down.

01:25:43.004 --> 01:25:43.993
Bring the coil on line.

01:25:44.105 --> 01:25:45.197
Prepare for transwarp.

01:25:51.312 --> 01:25:52.244
Tom?

01:25:52.313 --> 01:25:54.713
Transwarp in four...

01:25:54.782 --> 01:25:56.044
three...

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:57.583
two...

01:26:09.631 --> 01:26:13.158
A vessel entered the conduit
with us just before it closed.

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.395
They're targeting our engines.

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:16.697
Maintain course.

01:26:23.144 --> 01:26:25.339
Direct hit on the port nacelle.

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:27.040
We're venting plasma.

01:26:27.148 --> 01:26:28.342
Rerouting emergency power.

01:26:30.852 --> 01:26:31.784
lt's not enough.

01:26:31.853 --> 01:26:33.377
l'll need 30 teradynes at least,

01:26:33.454 --> 01:26:34.785
or we'll lose transwarp.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:36.551
How long
to the rendezvous coordinates?

01:26:36.624 --> 01:26:40.685
2.4 minutes, but we'll drop out
of transwarp in less than one.

01:26:40.762 --> 01:26:43.060
Reroute power from life support.

01:26:43.164 --> 01:26:44.256
Captain?

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:46.129
l'd rather suffocate
than vaporize. Do it.

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:54.366
l'm picking up
transwarp signatures.

01:26:54.475 --> 01:26:56.670
There's a conduit approaching--

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:58.644
30,000 kilometers
off our port bow.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:00.510
Battle stations.

01:27:07.589 --> 01:27:09.887
We're 20 seconds
from normal space.

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:10.982
The Borg vessel?

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:13.252
Still in pursuit,
closing rapidly.

01:27:13.328 --> 01:27:15.626
15 seconds.

01:27:17.865 --> 01:27:19.196
They're trying to lock
on with a tractor beam.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.995
Remodulate shields.

01:27:21.135 --> 01:27:22.227
Threshold in eight...

01:27:22.337 --> 01:27:25.306
seven... six...

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:26.431
They're locking on.

01:27:26.541 --> 01:27:28.008
l've repolarized the shields.

01:27:28.076 --> 01:27:29.338
lt's being deflected.

01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.775
Three, two...

01:27:34.582 --> 01:27:35.776
They're through.

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:37.875
Voyager to Delta Flyer.
Report.

01:27:37.952 --> 01:27:38.941
We've got Seven,

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.749
but there's a Borg vessel
right behind us.

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:44.155
B'Elanna, target
the threshold perimeter.

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:45.852
Photon torpedoes, full spread.

01:27:45.927 --> 01:27:47.155
Commander?

01:27:47.228 --> 01:27:49.423
lt should destabilize
the matter stream

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:52.295
and implode the conduit
for at least a light-year.

01:27:52.367 --> 01:27:54.699
Torpedoes locked.

01:27:54.802 --> 01:27:56.633
Fire!

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:05.644
Voyager, report.

01:28:05.713 --> 01:28:07.738
We collapsed the conduit.

01:28:07.815 --> 01:28:09.146
No sign of Borg activity.

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:10.616
Clear us for docking.

01:28:10.685 --> 01:28:11.913
We're coming home.

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:19.156
Commander, l'm picking up
Borg signatures--

01:28:19.227 --> 01:28:20.194
lots of them.

01:28:20.261 --> 01:28:21.193
Source?

01:28:21.262 --> 01:28:22.194
The conduit.

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:23.287
l thought you collapsed it.

01:28:23.364 --> 01:28:24.296
So did l.

01:28:24.365 --> 01:28:25.297
Stand by weapons.

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:27.493
Captain, raise shields.

01:28:27.602 --> 01:28:28.864
We've got company.

01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:30.494
Here they come.

01:28:46.287 --> 01:28:50.417
Captain's Log, Stardate 52619.2.

01:28:50.491 --> 01:28:52.686
We got
another 20,000 light-years

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.524
out of the transwarp coil
before it gave out.

01:28:55.596 --> 01:28:58.997
l figure we're
a good 15 years closer to home.

01:29:06.207 --> 01:29:08.675
l see you picked up
some bad habits.

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.334
Captain?

01:29:12.046 --> 01:29:12.978
The Doctor told you

01:29:13.047 --> 01:29:14.810
to regenerate
for at least two days.

01:29:14.882 --> 01:29:17.077
You're violating
a direct medical command.

01:29:17.151 --> 01:29:19.619
l will comply
when my work is completed.

01:29:21.723 --> 01:29:23.452
Borg tactical data?

01:29:23.524 --> 01:29:25.992
During my time at Unimatrix One,

01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:27.687
l acquired
a vast amount of knowledge.

01:29:27.762 --> 01:29:29.821
lt may prove useful
in our future encounters

01:29:29.897 --> 01:29:31.421
with the Borg.

01:29:31.499 --> 01:29:34.263
l am downloading it
into Voyager's database.

01:29:41.943 --> 01:29:44.275
The Borg believed l was unique,

01:29:44.345 --> 01:29:47.246
that l understood humanity.

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:50.910
They were obviously mistaken.

01:29:50.985 --> 01:29:52.577
How so?

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:54.848
l betrayed the crew of Voyager,

01:29:54.922 --> 01:29:56.913
threatened you
with assimilation.

01:29:56.991 --> 01:30:00.324
l did not expect you
to return for me.

01:30:01.429 --> 01:30:04.330
Looks like you still have
a few things to learn.

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:08.564
Time to regenerate.

01:30:08.669 --> 01:30:10.899
When l am finished.

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.199
No.

01:30:12.306 --> 01:30:13.534
Now.

01:30:13.608 --> 01:30:16.304
That's an order.

01:30:16.377 --> 01:30:18.402
Yes, Captain.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.258
Sweet dreams.
