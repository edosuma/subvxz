WEBVTT

00:03.786 --> 00:06.093
Hey.

00:10.532 --> 00:11.576
Yeah?
Can we get a laugh?

00:11.620 --> 00:14.579
Come on, Luna.

00:16.712 --> 00:17.800
How about a giggle?

00:17.843 --> 00:21.151
No? Nothing?

00:21.195 --> 00:25.155
- Maybe try your dance moves.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.158
- You wanna see some moves?

00:28.202 --> 00:29.681
Okay.

00:31.074 --> 00:32.815
Okay, yeah.
- ♪ Oh, whoo!

00:32.858 --> 00:35.165
♪ Say it now!

00:35.209 --> 00:37.080
- ♪ Get up off of that thing

00:37.124 --> 00:38.690
♪ And dance
until you feel better ♪

00:38.734 --> 00:41.171
- Oh, yeah.
- ♪ Get up off of that thing

00:41.215 --> 00:42.651
♪ And dance until you,
sing it now! ♪

00:42.694 --> 00:45.088
all:
♪ Get up off of that thing

00:45.132 --> 00:46.829
- Spin move.

00:46.872 --> 00:48.483
Nothing.

00:50.093 --> 00:52.791
Yeah? Is this--

00:52.835 --> 00:54.576
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm sorry.

00:54.619 --> 00:55.664
That was bad.
I know.

00:55.707 --> 00:57.666
I deserve that.
I deserve that.

00:57.709 --> 00:59.798
- You know she'll laugh
when she's ready.

00:59.842 --> 01:02.627
- Aww, baby.

01:02.671 --> 01:04.455
You know,
Mommy used to dance--

01:04.499 --> 01:07.241
yeah, not better than Daddy.

01:07.284 --> 01:09.156
She used to float on the air
like this.

01:09.199 --> 01:12.202
She was luminous.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.204
- Stop.

01:14.248 --> 01:16.163
- You were.

01:25.389 --> 01:27.739
She was.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.181
- And this is for you.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.878
- Thanks.
- No.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.619
I'm not just
giving you a dollar.

01:37.662 --> 01:41.188
This is also to ensure
doctor-patient confidentiality.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.364
- Okay, but you know my rates

01:43.407 --> 01:44.974
are considerably higher
than that, right?

01:45.017 --> 01:46.715
- Remember I told you that
I am going to be a grandfather?

01:46.758 --> 01:47.846
- Mm-hmm.

01:47.890 --> 01:49.500
- I was not supposed
to tell you that.

01:49.544 --> 01:51.415
- Why, because it's
the first trimester?

01:51.459 --> 01:53.461
- No, because Ella
may not keep it.

01:53.504 --> 01:55.245
- Uh, what--what?

01:55.289 --> 01:57.204
Okay.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.728
How do you feel about that?

01:59.771 --> 02:01.208
Like--

02:01.251 --> 02:02.426
- Helpless?
- Yes.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.602
- Yeah.
- And I don't like it.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.604
I'm going to talk to her.
- What? No.

02:06.648 --> 02:09.520
No, no, no, no, you can't--
you can't talk to her.

02:09.564 --> 02:12.175
Ella's about to make
a profoundly personal decision,

02:12.219 --> 02:13.350
one that is only hers to make.

02:13.394 --> 02:14.830
- Yeah, but--
- Ah-ah, no "buts."

02:14.873 --> 02:17.441
No meddling, no prying.

02:17.485 --> 02:18.790
You can't even ask.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.618
- So,

02:20.662 --> 02:22.185
what can I do?

02:22.229 --> 02:25.449
- Whatever you need to do
to not talk to her about it,

02:25.493 --> 02:28.322
you should do that.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.588
- There you are.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.677
- Sorry I didn't call you back.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.635
It's been a crazy morning.

02:37.679 --> 02:38.897
- Seems like
all your mornings are crazy.

02:40.290 --> 02:42.205
- How Memorial thought
that they can restructure

02:42.249 --> 02:45.687
their entire legal department
in just two months is...

02:45.730 --> 02:48.559
- Hey, well, in two days,
you get to walk away from it

02:48.603 --> 02:51.301
and I get to have you
back home in my arms

02:51.345 --> 02:52.650
while we plan
our wedding together.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.305
- Can't wait.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.307
- Well, sounds like you can.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.396
- No.
I'm sorry.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.964
I just really want to leave
the team in good shape,

03:02.007 --> 03:03.661
and we're pretty far from that.

03:05.750 --> 03:07.448
You've got this.

03:09.363 --> 03:11.234
- Babe, I--I gotta go.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.845
- Love you.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.761
- Don't look so worried, Paz.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.285
You're just here
for your routine scan

03:18.328 --> 03:21.201
to check on the progress
of your tumor.

03:21.244 --> 03:22.376
Did your sister tell you

03:22.419 --> 03:23.855
how promising
her last PET scan was?

03:23.899 --> 03:26.902
- That's not why she's upset.

03:26.945 --> 03:29.861
Sorry, but you should tell her.
- Paz?

03:29.905 --> 03:32.777
- As you know...

03:32.821 --> 03:36.216
when uterine cancer
threw a wrench

03:36.259 --> 03:38.609
into my IVF plan, I mean,

03:38.653 --> 03:41.482
Jasmine stepped up
to be my surrogate.

03:41.525 --> 03:44.702
And she did months of testing
and hormone injections...

03:44.746 --> 03:46.661
- I was going to be implanted
next week.

03:46.704 --> 03:49.272
- But our insurance company
suddenly changed the rule.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.492
Now they won't cover surrogacy
of any kind.

03:51.535 --> 03:54.364
- That's insane.
When did they change the rules?

03:54.408 --> 03:55.844
Three weeks ago, Max.

03:55.887 --> 03:58.368
They basically stopped
covering surrogacy overnight.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.370
- Even though both sisters
are with the same company.

04:00.414 --> 04:02.329
- Barcroft,
who will cover Jasmine

04:02.372 --> 04:03.373
if she wants to have a baby

04:03.417 --> 04:05.070
and Paz if she could
have a baby,

04:05.114 --> 04:06.768
but they won't cover Jasmine if
she wants to have Paz's baby.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.553
I mean, it's not as if Paz's
embryo inside Jasmine's womb

04:09.597 --> 04:11.076
is gonna cost them
any more money.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.383
- Right, but having no baby
saves them a lot of money.

04:13.427 --> 04:15.298
- Adoption agencies
aren't exactly queuing up

04:15.342 --> 04:18.345
to give kids to women
with cancer, so what now?

04:18.388 --> 04:19.998
I mean, Paz waits three years

04:20.042 --> 04:21.739
to see if her uterus
is still "hospitable"

04:21.783 --> 04:23.001
after all the radiation?

04:23.045 --> 04:24.742
That's her only shot
of becoming a mother?

04:24.786 --> 04:27.919
- Helen, if Barcroft
changed the rule overnight,

04:27.963 --> 04:31.401
then let's get them
to change it right back.

04:34.361 --> 04:35.579
- Dr. Ligon isn't back yet?

04:35.623 --> 04:37.668
- Not only is he
still on vacation,

04:37.712 --> 04:39.627
he is also the kind of person
who turns his phone off

04:39.670 --> 04:41.193
while on vacation.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.804
Who does that to an addict?
- Use someone else already.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.719
I heard great things
about Dr. Parsons.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.939
- Seven-year-old
accidental choking victim.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.376
Got caught in window blinds.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.682
Heart rate 118.
BP 110 over 78.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.859
18 respirations per minute.
Setting 98% on nasal cannula.

04:54.903 --> 04:56.034
- Okay, let's get him
to trauma one.

04:56.078 --> 04:59.603
We're gonna take
good care of you, okay?

04:59.647 --> 05:00.909
- That's our son.
- Yeah, you can see him

05:00.952 --> 05:02.432
once the doctors get him
stabilized, okay?

05:02.476 --> 05:04.086
But let me show you
where the waiting room...

05:04.129 --> 05:05.609
- It's gonna be okay.

05:05.653 --> 05:07.742
- Hey, hey, come with me.

05:10.614 --> 05:11.876
- Sweetie, come on.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.709
- Look straight ahead.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.581
That's it, Calvin.

05:20.624 --> 05:22.104
Good job.

05:30.982 --> 05:34.116
Can you tell me what kind
of blinds you got caught in?

05:34.159 --> 05:35.944
- I don't know.

05:44.518 --> 05:47.390
-  Let's get Iggy and
Child Services down here now.

05:47.434 --> 05:50.132
- What do you think?
- Let's just hope I'm wrong.

05:54.397 --> 05:57.444
- I was, uh, cooking breakfast.

05:57.487 --> 06:00.969
Calvin was in his room playing,
and it was quiet.

06:01.012 --> 06:03.667
It's never quiet,
so I went to check in on him

06:03.711 --> 06:07.845
and I saw a cord, uh,

06:07.889 --> 06:09.412
wrapped around his little neck.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.415
And I tried to rip it off,

06:12.459 --> 06:13.721
but it was all knotted up,

06:13.764 --> 06:16.854
so I started screaming
for Alana.

06:16.898 --> 06:18.987
- I turned the house
upside down

06:19.030 --> 06:20.510
trying to find scissors.

06:20.554 --> 06:24.384
By the time I got them,
Calvin was turning blue.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.691
He was thrashing,
so Ethan had to hold him still.

06:27.735 --> 06:31.086
You know, I--I was
scared I was gonna cut him.

06:31.129 --> 06:34.916
But I got them off
and we called 911.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.833
- Now, if the police were
to come to your home--

06:38.876 --> 06:41.009
- The police?
- Yeah, the police.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.140
If they were to come
to your home, they would see

06:42.184 --> 06:43.794
a piece of cord
lying on the floor

06:43.838 --> 06:46.188
where your wife cut it, right?

06:46.231 --> 06:49.713
- You know,
I think I threw it away.

06:49.757 --> 06:50.888
- You threw it away?

06:50.932 --> 06:53.587
- Yes, after we got him loose.

06:53.630 --> 06:55.153
- But the rest of the cord

06:55.197 --> 06:58.069
would still be dangling there,
severed.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.723
That's what the police
would see.

07:02.683 --> 07:03.727
- And--and they would also see

07:03.771 --> 07:05.163
the scissors
lying on the floor.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.730
And the drawers that
Alana looked through,

07:06.774 --> 07:08.428
they would all be open.

07:08.471 --> 07:09.907
And the breakfast
that you were cooking

07:09.951 --> 07:12.040
would still be...

07:12.083 --> 07:14.216
on the stove.

07:14.259 --> 07:16.784
- Th-there were no scissors.

07:16.827 --> 07:19.613
Um, there was no cord.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.486
It was, uh...

07:26.620 --> 07:28.099
Just me.

07:28.143 --> 07:29.753
But I swear,
it'll never happen again.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.103
Please don't--
please don't take him away.

07:32.147 --> 07:36.891
- So what are you saying,
that I'm lying?

07:36.934 --> 07:40.460
- The marks on Calvin's neck
aren't abrasions.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.592
They're bruises.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.465
A cord didn't do it.
Hands did.

07:51.296 --> 07:53.516
It was me.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.866
He was having a tantrum.

07:55.910 --> 07:57.520
I just snapped.

07:57.564 --> 08:00.958
I didn't know I was choking him.
I just wanted him to stop.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.091
- Ethan, I don't think
that your son

08:03.134 --> 08:06.921
was choked by a man.

08:06.964 --> 08:09.532
The wounds on his neck
were far too small.

08:09.576 --> 08:12.187
- May I see your hands?

08:16.191 --> 08:18.019
- A person who chokes someone

08:18.062 --> 08:21.065
often has defensive wounds
on their hands

08:21.109 --> 08:23.807
from the fingernails
of the person they're choking.

08:23.851 --> 08:25.069
You don't.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.036
- What happened
to your brother, Juliet?

08:38.082 --> 08:40.998
- I wanted his phone,

08:41.042 --> 08:43.261
so I took it.

08:45.655 --> 08:48.484
- Thank you for choosing
Barcroft insurance.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.616
This is Jonathan, how can I
be of service to you today?

08:49.659 --> 08:50.834
- Uh, Jonathan, hi.

08:50.878 --> 08:53.533
This is, uh, Dr. Max Goodwin,

08:53.576 --> 08:56.187
uh, calling about
a recent policy change.

08:56.231 --> 08:58.886
No, no, I don't need billing.
Operator.

08:58.929 --> 09:01.410
- I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.803
- Operator!

09:02.846 --> 09:05.545
- This is regarding
account number 42118?

09:05.588 --> 09:07.068
- No, it's regarding Paz Aquino.

09:07.111 --> 09:09.461
She's not a number.
She's a person.

09:09.505 --> 09:11.594
I know this is
the wrong department, Frank,

09:11.638 --> 09:13.509
but it seems to be
the only department

09:13.553 --> 09:15.903
populated by people.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.165
- Our call center's
in Bangalore.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.558
- Bangalore, wow.

09:18.601 --> 09:20.690
Uh, is there any way
you could connect me

09:20.734 --> 09:23.084
to someone a little closer
to this side of the Earth?

09:23.127 --> 09:25.869
- Good afternoon.
- Mm, is it?

09:25.913 --> 09:28.524
I have a question for you:
you don't happen to be located

09:28.568 --> 09:31.527
anywhere in the
Western Hemisphere, do you?

09:31.571 --> 09:33.747
- I'm in Kuala Lumpur.
- Kuala Lumpur.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.139
Um, forgive my ignorance.

09:35.183 --> 09:38.012
Is that closer to New York City
than Bangalore?

09:38.055 --> 09:40.101
- Please hold.
Let me check on that.

09:40.144 --> 09:42.625
- Happy to.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.630
- How do you think Calvin felt
when you hurt him?

09:50.851 --> 09:53.941
- Well, you know,
if I had to take a guess--

09:53.984 --> 09:56.683
which I don't,
but I'm going to--

09:56.726 --> 10:00.687
I would say that
he was probably afraid.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.210
- I don't know.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.952
- Hey, I am going
to say a sentence,

10:04.995 --> 10:06.954
and then you tell me
if it describes you.

10:06.997 --> 10:08.520
Can we do that?

10:08.564 --> 10:09.696
Okay, cool.

10:09.739 --> 10:14.526
"I think that
most other people are stupid."

10:14.570 --> 10:16.224
- I don't think that.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.008
- All right,
what about this one.

10:18.052 --> 10:20.184
"I manipulate people
to get what I want."

10:20.228 --> 10:21.969
- No.

10:24.014 --> 10:26.843
- Juliet, come on.

10:26.887 --> 10:28.497
It's okay.
It's just me and you in here.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.759
Right?

10:29.803 --> 10:31.674
I've seen tons of kids
come through here.

10:31.718 --> 10:36.287
It's obvious to me that
you are, like, mega smart.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.550
I'll bet you're the best
at manipulating people.

10:41.031 --> 10:42.293
- I'm really good at it.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.686
- Why?

10:43.730 --> 10:45.601
Why do you think
you're so good at it?

10:45.645 --> 10:49.692
- It's--it's kind of like
when I draw.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.999
- You mean manipulating people
makes you feel in control?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.870
- No.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.916
I mean, it's just really easy.

11:01.748 --> 11:03.619
- Mackenzie Adams?
- Yeah, hi.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.665
- Hi.
- This is my husband, John.

11:05.708 --> 11:06.883
both: Hi.

11:06.927 --> 11:08.145
- I'm Dr. Reynolds,
cardiothoracic surgery.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.191
- Cardio?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.019
- Uh, we came here because

11:12.062 --> 11:14.674
my wife, uh,
lost control of her bladder.

11:14.717 --> 11:15.979
- I'm sure it's just a UTI.

11:16.023 --> 11:17.546
- Well, no.

11:17.589 --> 11:18.982
The urologist said that all of
your tests came back negative,

11:19.026 --> 11:20.680
so cardio's the next step
in the workup.

11:20.723 --> 11:21.985
- Well, my heart is fine.

11:22.029 --> 11:23.857
- Well, heart issues
can affect bladder control,

11:23.900 --> 11:25.728
so we'll just do an EKG to
measure your heart's activity.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.296
- We're not even from New York.
We're just visiting.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.735
- It's a simple test,
Mrs. Adams.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.171
- Colonel Adams.

11:34.215 --> 11:36.304
She's an astronaut.
- Oh.

11:36.347 --> 11:38.959
- I'm scheduled to fly out
on Expedition 64

11:39.002 --> 11:40.264
to the
International Space Station

11:40.308 --> 11:42.223
in 58 weeks.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.747
I've been working toward this
my entire life.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.707
This is my first space mission,

11:47.750 --> 11:50.274
so nothing can be wrong
with my heart.

12:02.112 --> 12:05.072
Uh, what are you doing?

12:05.115 --> 12:06.769
- Mm.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.858
- Earth to Vijay.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.774
- I am meditating.

12:11.818 --> 12:14.603
- Okay.
Why?

12:14.646 --> 12:17.040
- To control
the chaos in my mind.

12:17.084 --> 12:19.173
Because I cannot
talk to someone

12:19.216 --> 12:22.829
I desperately want to talk to.

12:22.872 --> 12:24.395
- Well, that sounds
completely pointless,

12:24.439 --> 12:25.788
but you know what?

12:25.832 --> 12:28.095
I am desperate,
so I'm gonna give it a go.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.662
Come on, help me up here.

12:35.972 --> 12:38.801
- Okay, now fold your legs.
Sorry.

12:38.845 --> 12:41.761
Close your eyes and breathe.

12:46.983 --> 12:48.724
- I'm sorry, do you have
to breathe so loud?

12:48.768 --> 12:50.291
- Mm!

12:57.864 --> 12:59.126
- Hello, this is Aneel.

12:59.169 --> 13:02.085
- Aneel Jay who works
in the East 34th offices

13:02.129 --> 13:03.260
of Barcroft Insurance?

13:03.304 --> 13:04.696
- Uh, yes.

13:04.740 --> 13:05.785
- Who works
in the appeals department

13:05.828 --> 13:06.829
on the seventh floor?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.352
- Can I help you
with something?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.180
- Yeah, uh, could you remind me
of your office number?

13:10.224 --> 13:13.227
- 728.
What is this regarding?

13:13.270 --> 13:15.098
Hold on.
Yeah?

13:15.142 --> 13:17.361
- Hey, it's regarding the
extremely impersonal practice

13:17.405 --> 13:19.146
of trying to help someone
over the phone.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.843
I just think nothing
really gets done

13:20.887 --> 13:22.149
until you sit down with someone
face to face.

13:22.192 --> 13:23.715
You know what I mean?

13:23.759 --> 13:25.282
- I was just leaving for lunch.
- Were you?

13:25.326 --> 13:26.849
I know a great place.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.112
The honey yogurt's really good
if you want to try it.

13:29.156 --> 13:32.028
- Look, it was
an abrupt change, I know,

13:32.072 --> 13:33.856
but last year,
Barcroft hemorrhaged

13:33.900 --> 13:36.859
an unprecedented $80 million
in surrogacy coverage.

13:36.903 --> 13:40.080
- Sure, but how many babies did
you help bring into the world?

13:40.123 --> 13:41.211
- We don't track
that kind of data.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.909
- Mm.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.215
That's why I brought you here.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.261
Your company gives you data.

13:47.304 --> 13:49.176
You get case numbers
instead of stories.

13:49.219 --> 13:53.397
You get account numbers
instead of people.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.012
- What is this?

13:59.055 --> 14:02.058
- This is account number 42118.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.844
- Her name is Paz Aquino.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.760
- Excuse me.

14:12.242 --> 14:14.723
- Hey, Aneel?

14:14.766 --> 14:16.377
- And people say
insurance companies are cruel?

14:16.420 --> 14:19.467
- I'm just trying to show you--
- Human suffering?

14:19.510 --> 14:20.903
Thanks,

14:20.947 --> 14:23.384
but I hear heartbreaking
stories every day.

14:23.427 --> 14:25.777
Along with the carpal tunnel
and the crappy paycheck,

14:25.821 --> 14:27.214
it comes with the job.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.911
- Then why don't you help me
do something about it?

14:28.955 --> 14:30.739
- I may have a title
that sounds effectual,

14:30.782 --> 14:33.394
but I have absolutely no power.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.223
I can't help you do anything.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.798
- "I think that tears
are a sign of weakness."

14:46.842 --> 14:48.322
- Agree.

14:48.365 --> 14:51.803
- "I think that other people's
feelings are not important."

14:51.847 --> 14:52.979
- Agree.

14:55.285 --> 14:58.071
- "I think about
hurting my family."

14:58.114 --> 14:59.768
- Agree.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.773
- Just your brother?

15:04.816 --> 15:06.818
Who else?

15:06.862 --> 15:09.082
- My mom and dad.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.561
- Why do you want to hurt them?

15:13.477 --> 15:14.957
- Because I can.

15:24.314 --> 15:26.055
- You know, I mean, it's early,

15:26.099 --> 15:29.537
and one session
is a small sample, but, uh,

15:29.580 --> 15:32.453
Juliet does present
as callous-unemotional.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.109
- You're saying
she's a psychopath.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.942
- She's been to dozens
of doctors.

15:42.985 --> 15:46.032
We've heard schizophrenia,
ADHD, RAD.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.730
No one's ever said "psychopath."

15:48.773 --> 15:50.862
- Callous-unemotional.

15:50.906 --> 15:52.473
It's, um--it's not a diagnosis

15:52.516 --> 15:54.170
that doctors really
like to give because,

15:54.214 --> 15:56.433
historically speaking,

15:56.477 --> 15:58.827
there is no cure.

15:58.870 --> 16:01.134
- Then what do we do?
- Well...

16:01.177 --> 16:03.701
- She'll go into
an inpatient facility

16:03.745 --> 16:06.748
run by
the corrections department.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.707
- Jail?
She's 11.

16:09.751 --> 16:13.233
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.
There is one other possibility.

16:13.276 --> 16:17.759
Um, punishment bounces off
of callous-unemotional kids

16:17.802 --> 16:20.022
because they can't feel shame,

16:20.066 --> 16:22.807
but there has been some very
promising behavioral therapy

16:22.851 --> 16:24.984
based on a reward system.

16:25.027 --> 16:26.942
I'm sure you've noticed
Juliet's reward drive

16:26.986 --> 16:28.248
is extremely high.

16:28.291 --> 16:31.120
That's why she takes
whatever she wants.

16:31.164 --> 16:35.255
So if I can demonstrate
some progress with Juliet,

16:35.298 --> 16:37.039
we can admit her here.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.302
She could be an inpatient
at New Amsterdam.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.089
- Dr. Frome?
- Yeah.

16:43.132 --> 16:46.266
- Have you ever had success
with a child like Juliet?

16:52.881 --> 16:54.143
- No.

17:06.112 --> 17:07.200
- You okay?

17:07.243 --> 17:10.420
- Sex.

17:10.464 --> 17:14.381
I just replaced pills with sex.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.948
I would say that
I make the worst decisions,

17:16.992 --> 17:18.167
but you know what?

17:18.211 --> 17:19.908
I'm not even sure
that I make decisions.

17:19.951 --> 17:21.214
I just do things.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.433
- Why is that bad?

17:23.477 --> 17:26.262
If all of your instincts
tell you to do something,

17:26.306 --> 17:27.785
why shouldn't you do that?

17:27.829 --> 17:30.049
My instincts told me

17:30.092 --> 17:33.922
to bang my physical therapist,
and it is not going well.

17:33.965 --> 17:36.142
I thought I was
distracting myself

17:36.185 --> 17:39.101
from the pain,
but you know, actually,

17:39.145 --> 17:42.931
I think I was distracting
myself from being sober.

17:44.280 --> 17:46.456
You know what?
Enough is enough.

17:46.500 --> 17:50.286
God, it is time
to face reality--

17:50.330 --> 17:53.289
to stop avoiding
and start making decisions

17:53.333 --> 17:55.248
that are actually good for me,

17:55.291 --> 17:58.120
like go to an NA meeting.

17:58.164 --> 18:02.298
- You just got
all of that from meditating?

18:02.342 --> 18:04.126
- Yeah.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.954
That is how it works, right?

18:14.354 --> 18:15.964
- Yeah?

18:16.007 --> 18:17.444
No.

18:17.487 --> 18:20.360
- Not here to harass you.
I'm just here to apologize.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.145
- You are?
- Yes.

18:23.189 --> 18:26.322
And to find out
what office your boss is in.

18:26.366 --> 18:28.629
- You can't be serious.
-  Face to face.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.500
It's gotta be worth something.

18:30.544 --> 18:32.894
- Tenth floor, 1021.
- 1021?

18:32.937 --> 18:34.548
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.334
So at New Amsterdam,
we run into

18:38.378 --> 18:41.250
arcane policy inconsistencies
all the time.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.513
For example, Frances--
may I call you Frances?

18:43.557 --> 18:45.472
- I'd rather you didn't.
- Okay, sure.

18:45.515 --> 18:49.389
For example, there is
a very expensive spinal surgery

18:49.432 --> 18:51.173
that is covered
by your base policy,

18:51.217 --> 18:54.916
yet there is another procedure
that is less expensive

18:54.959 --> 18:58.180
and less invasive that is not.

18:58.224 --> 19:00.400
And that means that
Barcroft is, in turn,

19:00.443 --> 19:03.533
shelling out more money
than it has to.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.188
My patient, Paz Aquino--
- Account number?

19:06.232 --> 19:09.191
- It's 42118.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.065
- Her claim was denied

19:14.109 --> 19:16.372
because Barcroft
no longer covers surrogacy.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.374
- So I've heard,
but Barcroft will cover

19:18.418 --> 19:20.071
a uterus transplant for her,

19:20.115 --> 19:23.379
which is a procedure
that will cost ten times more.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.207
So, uh,
I guess what I'm saying is,

19:25.251 --> 19:28.645
if Barcroft doesn't want to
reverse its policy on surrogacy,

19:28.689 --> 19:31.257
then I am gonna have
to advise all of my patients

19:31.300 --> 19:34.216
to consider
uterine transplants instead.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.262
And how do you think that's
gonna affect your bottom line?

19:36.305 --> 19:37.698
- That's a good point.

19:37.741 --> 19:40.962
Maybe we should stop covering
uterine transplants

19:41.005 --> 19:42.398
starting now.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.533
Hm.

19:46.576 --> 19:49.231
- No, it is not covered--
- Hi, so sorry.

19:49.275 --> 19:51.538
Can you tell me who her boss is?

19:52.974 --> 19:55.977
- You have a condition called
supraventricular tachycardia.

19:56.020 --> 19:58.284
It's an atypically fast
heartbeat that develops when

19:58.327 --> 20:01.243
the heart's normal electrical
impulses are disrupted,

20:01.287 --> 20:03.550
and the frequency
of the palpitations

20:03.593 --> 20:05.116
forced your kidneys
into overdrive,

20:05.160 --> 20:06.466
which overwhelmed your bladder.

20:06.509 --> 20:07.945
- How do we fix it?

20:07.989 --> 20:09.991
- Well, I can do
a catheter ablation.

20:10.034 --> 20:11.297
It'll destroy the source
of the problem.

20:11.340 --> 20:12.428
It's non-surgical.

20:12.472 --> 20:13.603
You won't even have
to be put under.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.388
- NASA has run
hundreds of tests on me.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.128
How did they miss this?

20:17.172 --> 20:19.130
- It might be the first time
it happened.

20:19.174 --> 20:20.610
- Will it happen again?

20:20.654 --> 20:22.264
- It's hard to tell.
It might.

20:22.308 --> 20:23.439
- It won't.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.702
We came here last-minute
for family.

20:25.746 --> 20:28.575
I just need to get back
to Houston, back to training.

20:28.618 --> 20:30.054
- Mack.

20:30.098 --> 20:32.274
- NASA said I'm fine,
so I'm fine.

20:34.624 --> 20:37.148
- Um, Mackenzie,

20:37.192 --> 20:41.152
the attack you had today
probably lasted a few seconds,

20:41.196 --> 20:44.199
but a serious one
could last a few minutes,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.288
maybe even hours.

20:46.332 --> 20:47.768
And instead of losing control
of your bladder,

20:47.811 --> 20:50.336
you could lose consciousness.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.555
If that happens
while you're in space,

20:52.599 --> 20:55.210
your whole mission
could be compromised.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.473
You could risk the lives
of your crew.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.519
- I would never do that.

20:59.562 --> 21:01.651
- Then don't walk out of here.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.396
- If I do this procedure,
will I still be cleared to fly?

21:07.440 --> 21:08.789
- If it's successful,

21:08.832 --> 21:11.313
this will take care
of the problem permanently.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.706
After a period of observation,

21:12.749 --> 21:14.360
I don't see a reason why
you'd be grounded.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.755
- You got this.

21:21.541 --> 21:24.761
- Paz, I have your scan results

21:24.805 --> 21:26.633
from this morning.

21:26.676 --> 21:29.418
Your tumor has stopped
responding to the chemo.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.075
To prevent it from spreading,

21:34.118 --> 21:36.295
you'll need to have
a full hysterectomy.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.517
Once we remove the cancer
from your body,

21:41.561 --> 21:45.608
you will enter remission faster
and you will survive.

21:45.652 --> 21:47.393
- But...

21:49.395 --> 21:53.573
Then there--there's no way....

21:53.616 --> 21:55.618
I'm never gonna have a baby.

21:55.662 --> 21:58.142
- Hey, look at me.

21:58.186 --> 21:59.709
We will find a way.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.370
- Sorry.

22:08.414 --> 22:11.373
I know that there are more
important things than--

22:11.417 --> 22:15.334
but I always dreamed
of having a child.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.248
Yeah, I know that sounds
old-fashioned and--

22:17.292 --> 22:18.815
- No, no, no.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.340
No, it doesn't.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.385
It sounds human.

22:30.436 --> 22:33.177
- Okay, let's play a game.

22:33.221 --> 22:35.484
I will set a task,

22:35.528 --> 22:38.748
and if you complete it,
you win.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.489
- What do I win?

22:40.533 --> 22:42.665
- I am gonna give you

22:42.709 --> 22:45.407
Iggy Bucks.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.149
- Those look lame.
- Well, I'm not done.

22:48.192 --> 22:51.500
Iggy Bucks are how you get
to the real prize.

22:51.544 --> 22:55.548
50 of these earns one hour

22:55.591 --> 22:58.246
with this bad boy.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.900
All right?

22:59.943 --> 23:02.903
It just so happens that
this first task can earn you

23:02.946 --> 23:06.515
all 50 Iggy Bucks in one go.

23:06.559 --> 23:08.648
- What's the task?

23:08.691 --> 23:10.432
- You apologize to your brother.

23:10.476 --> 23:11.825
- No.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.435
- Why not?

23:13.479 --> 23:15.742
- He deserved it.

23:15.785 --> 23:17.657
- Juliet, I know that
you don't feel sorry,

23:17.700 --> 23:21.443
and I know that you may
never feel sorry,

23:21.487 --> 23:24.533
but hurting Calvin
was a big deal.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.666
And a big deal
means a big apology,

23:26.709 --> 23:30.800
but it also means
a big reward.

23:30.844 --> 23:34.151
You in?

23:34.195 --> 23:38.460
- If a big apology
means a big reward...

23:38.504 --> 23:41.158
what about a small apology?

23:41.202 --> 23:43.465
- Yeah, sure, okay.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.641
We'll start small.

23:45.685 --> 23:48.470
One small apology,
10 Iggy Bucks.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.388
- What's that?

23:53.432 --> 23:56.870
- Oh, um, that's something
that one of my kids made me.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.310
- It's ugly.
Is your kid stupid?

24:04.704 --> 24:07.837
I'm--I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.753
Small apology.
10 bucks.

24:12.363 --> 24:15.584
- Oh, okay.
Um, that is not--wow.

24:15.628 --> 24:18.500
I--I didn't, um--
- Okay, golly gee.

24:18.544 --> 24:20.328
Wow, hoop-dee-doo.

24:21.982 --> 24:24.506
- Is that supposed to be me?

24:24.550 --> 24:26.943
- I'm so sorry.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.728
20 bucks.

24:30.338 --> 24:32.296
- All right, I didn't say
that I was playing.

24:32.340 --> 24:34.516
- You never said
you weren't, Fat Face.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.518
Were you fat as a kid?

24:36.562 --> 24:38.607
Did other kids make fun of you
because you were fat?

24:38.651 --> 24:41.392
I'm so sorry.
30 bucks.

24:41.436 --> 24:43.525
- Okay, Juliet, why don't we
go over the rules of the game--

24:43.569 --> 24:45.396
- You sweat.
You're sweaty.

24:45.440 --> 24:46.833
You have sweat stains
under your arms.

24:46.876 --> 24:48.269
That's gross.
I'm sorry.

24:48.312 --> 24:49.488
40 bucks.

24:49.531 --> 24:51.402
- Okay, I'm not playing.

24:51.446 --> 24:52.795
I--

25:00.281 --> 25:03.023
Dr. Frome,

25:03.066 --> 25:04.764
I'm really sorry.

25:06.592 --> 25:10.552
50 bucks.
I win.

25:21.258 --> 25:23.347
- Okay, take it easy, man.
I'm just trying to help out.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.045
Aneel? Aneel?
- Come on.

25:25.088 --> 25:26.568
- Hey, this is my friend Aneel.
He's gonna explain everything.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.787
Could you explain to them that
we're just trying...

25:27.830 --> 25:29.266
- Come on.
- To help people?

25:29.310 --> 25:30.354
That we're trying
to do the right thing?

25:30.398 --> 25:32.400
Aneel?

25:32.443 --> 25:33.706
- Ella?

25:35.969 --> 25:39.799
I have been trying to fight
my instinct the whole day

25:39.842 --> 25:42.715
and I have finally decided
to come to you.

25:44.499 --> 25:47.720
For a cup of coffee.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.505
- Coffee.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.986
- I do not want to discuss
your personal matters,

25:53.029 --> 25:55.989
but I...

25:56.032 --> 25:58.513
I do want...

25:58.557 --> 26:01.690
Yes, I do want cream and sugar.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.387
Okay.

26:03.431 --> 26:05.389
- I do not want to pry, meddle,

26:05.433 --> 26:08.915
or counsel you in any way.

26:08.958 --> 26:11.570
So from now on,
for my cup of coffee,

26:11.613 --> 26:14.398
I will go
to the other coffee shop

26:14.442 --> 26:19.490
so no unintentional or
misconstrued advice slips out.

26:19.534 --> 26:22.232
But for now...

26:22.276 --> 26:25.279
I do want a croissant.

26:26.715 --> 26:28.412
No.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.936
Chocolate one, please.

26:42.949 --> 26:44.864
- Dr. Bloom.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.561
Dr. Ligon is back tomorrow

26:46.605 --> 26:47.997
and can see you
at the usual time.

26:48.041 --> 26:50.260
- No, actually, I would like
to book an appointment

26:50.304 --> 26:52.393
with Dr. Parsons
for tomorrow morning.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.917
- Mm, Dr. Parsons'
all booked up tomorrow morning,

26:54.961 --> 26:56.571
but Dr. Ligon is free.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.051
- What about tomorrow afternoon?

26:58.094 --> 27:02.446
- Dr. Ligon
has an opening at noon.

27:02.490 --> 27:04.318
- Parsons.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.757
- I'll squeeze you right in.

27:08.801 --> 27:10.933
- Thank you.

27:13.806 --> 27:16.896
- I see the aberrant pathway.

27:16.939 --> 27:19.028
Hmm.

27:19.072 --> 27:21.727
Well, there's a second pathway.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.685
- What does that mean?

27:23.729 --> 27:25.687
- All right, if do more
than one ablation,

27:25.731 --> 27:27.907
it could weaken your heart

27:27.950 --> 27:30.387
and increase the chance
of recurrence.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.478
- I'm sorry, Mackenzie.
You need surgery.

27:34.522 --> 27:37.003
- That will ground me.

27:37.046 --> 27:40.484
- Well, so will a fragile heart.

27:43.966 --> 27:47.013
When I was little,
I used to sneak out of the house

27:47.056 --> 27:49.711
when everyone was asleep.

27:49.755 --> 27:53.672
I would lie in the yard
and feel the dark all around me,

27:53.715 --> 27:58.589
and I would look up
at the stars and I knew...

27:58.633 --> 28:00.940
that someday,
I would be up there with them.

28:04.683 --> 28:06.902
I really
thought I would get there.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.387
All right, I don't like it,

28:13.430 --> 28:16.520
but I can do two ablations.

28:16.564 --> 28:19.872
It will destroy
all the damage, but...

28:19.915 --> 28:21.787
after the procedure,
you have to let me

28:21.830 --> 28:23.919
put your heart through
a stress test.

28:23.963 --> 28:26.443
- Is that dangerous?

28:26.487 --> 28:29.359
- Well, if the ablations
are insufficient,

28:29.403 --> 28:31.840
it could push Mackenzie
into cardiac arrest.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.846
You could die.
- I won't.

28:39.761 --> 28:41.023
I won't.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.599
- So, Mackenzie's resting.

28:51.642 --> 28:53.775
We'll do the stress test
in the morning.

28:53.819 --> 28:56.038
Thank you.

28:58.780 --> 29:01.783
- Can I ask you something?

29:01.827 --> 29:04.873
- How can I be
married to someone

29:04.917 --> 29:08.747
who loves space
more than she loves me?

29:08.790 --> 29:12.098
- Well, I wasn't gonna
put it like that.

29:12.141 --> 29:13.969
- I love Mackenzie

29:14.013 --> 29:17.494
the way she loves the stars.

29:17.538 --> 29:21.542
She loves me more
than anything on Earth.

29:21.585 --> 29:24.066
Can't ask for more than that.

29:24.110 --> 29:25.807
- Could ask her to stay.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.505
- Uh, you think
John Glenn's wife

29:28.549 --> 29:30.072
ever asked him to stay?

29:30.116 --> 29:32.509
- I wouldn't blame her
if she had.

29:34.947 --> 29:38.167
You know what
the Kármán line is?

29:38.211 --> 29:41.867
It's the boundary
where Earth ends

29:41.910 --> 29:44.608
and space begins.

29:44.652 --> 29:47.176
Loving Mack means

29:47.220 --> 29:50.876
helping her cross that line,

29:50.919 --> 29:54.793
even if she's leaving me
on the other side of it.

30:11.070 --> 30:14.203
- I really thought
that face to face...

30:15.944 --> 30:17.816
How could they say no?

30:25.693 --> 30:28.739
- But it's so unfair.

30:28.783 --> 30:30.132
- Yeah.

30:30.176 --> 30:33.614
- I mean, even without
the financial issues,

30:33.657 --> 30:36.008
IVF is--

30:36.051 --> 30:38.837
it's so fraught.

30:38.880 --> 30:43.711
It's just so filled with hope
and with...

30:43.754 --> 30:46.540
despair, and--

30:46.583 --> 30:48.803
and blame.

30:51.545 --> 30:53.939
- Helen?

30:53.982 --> 30:56.767
Did you...

30:59.161 --> 31:03.035
- After the accident,

31:03.078 --> 31:06.299
everything just seemed so....

31:06.342 --> 31:07.866
fragile.

31:13.001 --> 31:14.829
I don't really know
what I was waiting for.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.961
It's what I've always wanted,

31:16.004 --> 31:20.139
so I just went
and I made it happen.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.793
And the minute that I did it,

31:22.837 --> 31:26.885
I knew that I'd made a mistake.

31:26.928 --> 31:30.714
Because I want to be a mum,

31:30.758 --> 31:33.979
but I realized that
I don't want to do it alone.

31:39.941 --> 31:41.987
And luckily, it didn't take.

31:45.338 --> 31:48.254
- We can't let Paz lose.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.695
- Juliet, grab a seat.

31:54.738 --> 31:58.829
So, you were really
very good at my game.

31:58.873 --> 32:00.353
- Your game was easy.

32:00.396 --> 32:03.356
- Yeah, you kicked my butt good.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.271
But I'm not so sure

32:05.314 --> 32:07.969
if you're ready
for the harder version.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.058
Expert level.

32:10.102 --> 32:12.191
- I'm great at games.
- You are.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.976
Yeah, you're great at games
because you like winning,

32:15.020 --> 32:17.283
but also because

32:17.326 --> 32:20.286
you like making
other people lose.

32:20.329 --> 32:22.244
You made me lose emotionally.

32:22.288 --> 32:24.768
You made Calvin lose physically.

32:24.812 --> 32:28.903
Whenever you win,
someone else has to lose.

32:28.947 --> 32:30.731
- That's how winning works.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.777
- Yes, but not in expert level.

32:33.821 --> 32:36.258
In expert level,
you have to win

32:36.302 --> 32:39.348
without the other person
ever knowing that they lost.

32:40.697 --> 32:43.874
You make somebody angry,
you upset them, that's it.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.702
Game over.

32:45.746 --> 32:48.270
You lose.

32:48.314 --> 32:50.707
- What do I get if I win?

32:53.667 --> 32:55.234
- Calvin's phone.

32:57.671 --> 33:00.979
- So...

33:01.022 --> 33:03.633
when do we start?

33:03.677 --> 33:05.244
- Right now.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.164
- All right, Mackenzie,

33:12.207 --> 33:14.949
I'm going to inject your IV
with enough adrenaline

33:14.993 --> 33:17.734
to simulate
the stress of launch

33:17.778 --> 33:20.041
and reentry, all right?

33:20.085 --> 33:23.697
Now, it's going to be
extremely intense, all right?

33:23.740 --> 33:25.177
It's gonna feel like
your heart's pounding

33:25.220 --> 33:27.962
right out of your chest,
but the first sign of trouble,

33:28.006 --> 33:31.313
I'm gonna stop the test
and intervene.

33:31.357 --> 33:33.141
-  Okay.

33:38.059 --> 33:41.802
- Now, the target
is 195 beats per minute.

33:41.845 --> 33:45.806
If you can achieve that
without any cardiac event,

33:45.849 --> 33:47.982
you should be clear to fly.

33:51.986 --> 33:53.248
Ready when you are.

34:10.135 --> 34:12.006
Faster.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.312
Breathe.

34:41.035 --> 34:44.082
Mackenzie? Mackenzie?

34:45.779 --> 34:48.086
- Come on back.

34:57.921 --> 35:00.010
- Congratulations.
You passed.

35:00.054 --> 35:01.708
- You did it.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.971
You did it.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.929
- We did it?

35:13.067 --> 35:15.939
Oh...

35:19.160 --> 35:21.162
- Hey, sweetie.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.512
- Hey, Dad.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.993
Hey, Cal.

35:26.036 --> 35:28.430
- Hey.

35:28.474 --> 35:31.825
- I'm sorry I hurt you

35:31.868 --> 35:35.176
for a stupid phone.

35:35.220 --> 35:40.094
I really didn't mean to...

35:40.138 --> 35:42.140
and I'm...

35:42.183 --> 35:45.404
really sorry.

35:45.447 --> 35:47.928
- Okay.

35:49.451 --> 35:52.280
- Can I--can I play
with your phone?

35:52.324 --> 35:54.413
- I'm not done.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.328
- But I apologized.

36:02.943 --> 36:05.859
Here.
Trade.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.208
- No.
- I want it.

36:07.252 --> 36:08.949
I apologized.
- Juliet--

36:08.992 --> 36:10.255
- I think we're done here.
- I want it!

36:10.298 --> 36:12.257
I want it!
I want it! I want it!

36:12.300 --> 36:15.347
- Shh.

36:22.005 --> 36:24.356
I don't know why
I get so angry,

36:24.399 --> 36:26.009
and I wish I did,
because everyone thinks

36:26.053 --> 36:28.229
I don't care about anyone,
but I do!

36:28.273 --> 36:29.970
I care about you.

36:30.013 --> 36:32.538
And I want your phone because
when we play the same games,

36:32.581 --> 36:35.845
that's the only way
I know how to be close to you.

36:37.499 --> 36:41.851
- I thought you hated me.

36:41.895 --> 36:44.550
- I hate that I'm...

36:44.593 --> 36:46.987
different from you.

36:59.434 --> 37:01.393
Thank you.

37:11.359 --> 37:13.405
- You call that progress?
That was terrifying.

37:13.448 --> 37:15.842
She manipulated them.
- Okay, yeah.

37:15.885 --> 37:17.496
I mean, I'll give you
that it wasn't exactly

37:17.539 --> 37:19.280
a Hallmark moment, but come on.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.456
We all operate on
a reward system of some kind.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.110
You know, you do good in school,
you get good grades,

37:23.153 --> 37:24.372
your parents buy you a car.

37:24.416 --> 37:26.461
You hold down a job
and you get money.

37:26.505 --> 37:29.029
We'll spend the next few years
shifting Juliet's prizes

37:29.072 --> 37:31.205
from phones to real-world things
and then who knows?

37:31.249 --> 37:33.468
If she can learn to always
play on expert level,

37:33.512 --> 37:35.644
maybe she'll win the big prize--
a normal life.

37:35.688 --> 37:37.559
- But...

37:37.603 --> 37:40.083
there will always be something
missing with her.

37:40.127 --> 37:41.911
- Yes, empathy.

37:41.955 --> 37:46.264
She'll never have it,
so we have to have it for her.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.399
- Thank you for choosing
Marcos Insurance.

37:51.443 --> 37:52.661
This is Melissa.

37:52.705 --> 37:54.010
How can I be of service
to you today?

37:54.054 --> 37:56.317
- Hi, Melissa,
I'm just calling to see

37:56.361 --> 38:00.147
if your company provides
coverage for surrogacy.

38:00.190 --> 38:01.366
- Well, I'm sorry, sir.

38:01.409 --> 38:03.063
Unfortunately,
Marcos Insurance

38:03.106 --> 38:04.499
does not cover surrogacy
of any--

38:08.634 --> 38:11.289
- I wanted to be a doctor.

38:13.421 --> 38:15.075
- You did?

38:15.118 --> 38:17.425
- I did a year of med school,

38:17.469 --> 38:19.514
but I couldn't cut it,

38:19.558 --> 38:23.083
and I've spent
the last ten years

38:23.126 --> 38:25.215
kind of numb

38:25.259 --> 38:27.348
because instead
of helping people,

38:27.392 --> 38:29.394
I ended up doing
the exact opposite.

38:33.049 --> 38:34.964
Until today.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.363
- Trustee exemption?

38:42.407 --> 38:43.625
- Anyone on
the board of trustees

38:43.669 --> 38:45.279
can override a policy claim

38:45.323 --> 38:47.629
without changing
the policy itself.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.675
- Then you found a trustee

38:49.718 --> 38:52.330
and got them to make
an exception for 42118?

38:52.373 --> 38:54.070
- No.

38:54.114 --> 38:57.335
I got them to make an exception
for Paz Aquino.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.467
She and her sister
can proceed with IVF.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.602
- Aneel?
- No.

39:03.645 --> 39:06.431
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39:06.474 --> 39:08.041
- How did you pull this off?

39:08.084 --> 39:11.174
- I talked to someone
at the top, face to face.

39:12.654 --> 39:14.743
- Yes.

39:14.787 --> 39:16.615

I didn't mean to--

- Think things come out, uh--

41:51.639 --> 41:53.380
- I know.

41:53.423 --> 41:56.644
- We have a, uh,

42:11.485 --> 42:13.313
Okay.
