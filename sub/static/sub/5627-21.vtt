WEBVTT

00:07.330 --> 00:11.250
Fletcham Correctional Center
TROY, VIRGINIA

00:11.540 --> 00:13.120
Oh, no, no, no.

00:13.120 --> 00:16.710
People, when are you gonna learn the
white power speak just ain't gonna fly?

00:17.460 --> 00:19.380
The Viscount and the Maiden?

00:19.380 --> 00:21.170
-What's a viscount?
-I think it's like a pirate.

00:21.960 --> 00:24.290
I should get a copy of this,
read it to my lady Friday night.

00:24.290 --> 00:26.500
- -You got plans this weekend?

00:26.500 --> 00:28.460
Ah, watch the game, chill with Jasmine.

00:28.460 --> 00:30.040
Jasmine

00:30.380 --> 00:31.500
What the hell?

00:35.380 --> 00:37.790
Two years ago,
12-year-old Adam Morrissey

00:37.790 --> 00:41.330
vanished on his way home from school
from Franklin, Virginia.

00:41.710 --> 00:43.170
At the time,
he was living with his mother,

00:43.170 --> 00:44.880
who had just gone through
a bitter divorce.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.000
I remember this.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.460
His mother and local authorities

00:47.460 --> 00:50.620
believed he was abducted
by his father and taken to Mexico.

00:50.620 --> 00:52.330
Yes. And then three months after that,

00:52.330 --> 00:54.500
13-year-old Jimmy Bennett
went missing

00:54.500 --> 00:56.830
from Richmond, Virginia,
75 miles away.

00:56.830 --> 00:59.620
He was in foster care because
both of his parents were drug addicts.

00:59.620 --> 01:02.120
He had run away once before, so police
assumed that it happened again.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.460
The cases were thought
to be unrelated until last night.

01:04.460 --> 01:07.290
That is when prison guards
at Fletcham Correctional Center

01:07.290 --> 01:10.500
intercepted an incoming package
containing the clothes

01:10.500 --> 01:11.670
both boys were last seen in.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.290
DNA samples from skin cells
found on the clothing

01:14.290 --> 01:16.000
were confirmed to match
the missing boys,

01:16.000 --> 01:17.210
so we know the items are authentic.

01:17.460 --> 01:19.420
And there's dried blood on the clothes.

01:19.420 --> 01:20.540
That's not a good sign.

01:20.540 --> 01:21.960
Who was the package
being sent to?

01:21.960 --> 01:23.210
Antonia Slade.

01:23.880 --> 01:25.000
You don't say.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.540
She was a serial killer
captured fifteen years ago, right?

01:27.540 --> 01:30.290
The runaway killer.
She was a clinical social worker

01:30.290 --> 01:32.120
and she started this runaway hotline

01:32.120 --> 01:35.120
in order to lure her preferred victims,
young teens, to her home.

01:35.960 --> 01:37.210
Gideon was on that case.

01:37.210 --> 01:39.290
It says here that she lived
with her long-time lover,

01:39.290 --> 01:41.580
Phil Garmin, who shot
himself when police arrived.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.830
They found nine bodies.
Five girls, four boys.

01:44.830 --> 01:47.580
Wrapped in plastic, encased behind
the drywall of her basement.

01:47.580 --> 01:49.380
All the victims had been
shot in the back of the head.

01:49.830 --> 01:51.750
It drove Gideon crazy
that she never

01:51.750 --> 01:53.960
talked about the murders
after her arrest.

01:53.960 --> 01:56.580
-She never explained why she did it.
-And she never has.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.460
Any information
on the package itself?

01:58.460 --> 02:00.460
The package was postmarked
in Roanoke.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.580
The return address was the prison.

02:02.580 --> 02:03.960
When police went to
question the post office,

02:03.960 --> 02:05.250
no one could recall who sent it.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.000
Okay, I'm going to ask
the obvious question here,

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
but do we really think
these boys are still alive?

02:11.000 --> 02:13.380
Based on the clothes, I'd
say it doesn't bode well.

02:13.380 --> 02:14.920
Well, there is the timing of the package.

02:14.920 --> 02:17.420
I mean, why send it now,
two years after the kidnappings,

02:17.420 --> 02:18.960
if the boys have long been dead?

02:19.210 --> 02:22.080
Someone might be trying to replicate
one of Antonia's crimes.

02:22.380 --> 02:24.210
Well, the boys were too young
when they were taken,

02:24.210 --> 02:25.790
but they'd be the right age now.

02:25.790 --> 02:28.920
What if Antonia's orchestrating
this entire thing from behind bars?

02:28.920 --> 02:30.290
We need to talk to her.

02:31.790 --> 02:33.750
Get up, Antonia.

02:33.750 --> 02:35.170
FBI's coming to question you.

02:35.960 --> 02:37.330
Would you like to know why?

02:37.330 --> 02:39.210
All right, I'll play.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.710
I'd like to tell you,
but nothing comes for free.

02:42.460 --> 02:44.120
-Name your price.
-Information.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.580
Look at you chomping at the bit,
waiting for your next promotion.

02:50.210 --> 02:52.500
Would my first confession do?

02:53.080 --> 02:54.500
Or better yet...

02:55.580 --> 02:57.460
My first explanation.

02:58.330 --> 02:59.380
That'll work.

03:01.920 --> 03:04.080
Well, let me tell you about Helen McGill.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.880
Victim number four,
as the police called her.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.710
She'd been living in my house a week

03:09.710 --> 03:13.080
when the poor lamb
complained of a tummy ache one night.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.790
She said she needed to throw up.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.670
Oh, my God. It hurts so much.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.460
I held her hand...

03:23.460 --> 03:25.790
What is that

03:25.790 --> 03:28.000
No, please don't do that.
I'll follow the rules.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.790
- -

03:31.080 --> 03:32.960
I gave her a cup of mint tea.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.290
You think that's funny?

03:35.710 --> 03:38.380
I do. Because now you won't
know why the FBI's coming.

03:38.830 --> 03:41.290
And I'm keeping you
in solitary at least an extra month.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.670
I already know why.

03:46.380 --> 03:49.540
It's about the package of bloody clothes
from those missing boys.

03:51.750 --> 03:54.250
Send the FBI in when they arrive,

03:55.040 --> 03:57.540
you tell them I got certain requirements.

04:33.710 --> 04:35.580
"Don't you know there comes
a midnight hour

04:35.580 --> 04:37.960
"when everyone has
to take off his mask?"

04:38.460 --> 04:39.500
Soren Kierkegaard.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.080
You must be Agent Hotchner.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.420
Yes, sir. This is Agent Jareau.

04:45.620 --> 04:47.710
Pleasure. I'm the warden here.
Bart Shulman.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.670
How long has Antonia Slade
been in solitary?

04:50.670 --> 04:53.580
Four weeks. We found
a road map of the state in her cell.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.580
She claims that a groupie sent it and
we missed it during mail inspection.

04:57.210 --> 04:58.830
Would you send a copy of her mail and

04:58.830 --> 05:00.960
visitor log to our analyst
in Quantico, please?

05:00.960 --> 05:02.080
-No problem.
-Thanks.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.580
Does she have a lot of groupies?

05:03.580 --> 05:06.080
More than you'd think. But
every so often some sick son of a bitch

05:06.080 --> 05:08.250
shows up outside our gates
hoping she'll see him.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.380
And does she?

05:09.380 --> 05:12.380
No. No, other than her lawyer
when she was first incarcerated,

05:12.380 --> 05:14.210
she refused to see anyone till now.

05:15.670 --> 05:17.580
Open the gate.
-

05:19.250 --> 05:21.460
Did she say anything
when she agreed to see us?

05:21.960 --> 05:24.080
Yes. She'll only see you one at a time.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.380
She insisted on it. She says too many
people make her feel claustrophobic.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.210
-She's in C-306.
-

05:30.210 --> 05:33.290
And you remember not to take anything
from her or give her anything.

05:41.790 --> 05:42.960
Open 306.

05:57.540 --> 05:58.920
Ms. Slade?

05:59.880 --> 06:01.710
I'm Aaron Hotchner. I'm with the FBI.

06:05.920 --> 06:08.000
There are two boys missing in Virginia.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
Adam Morrissey and Jimmy Bennett.

06:11.710 --> 06:13.330
Do you know anything about them?

06:14.960 --> 06:17.830
A box with some of their clothes
was delivered here addressed to you.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.790
Do you know who sent it?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.500
Antonia, I realize
you have no reason to help us.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.960
But you did agree to see me, and that
tells me you have something to say.

06:37.460 --> 06:39.210
Right now you hold all the cards.

06:40.380 --> 06:43.290
You're the only one who can break
this case open, and we need your help.

07:02.790 --> 07:07.500
"All work and no play
makes Agent Hotchner a dull boy."

07:08.330 --> 07:11.960
She's always refused visitors until now.
So why play a mind game?

07:11.960 --> 07:14.670
Well, to be honest, did she really have
a choice with us showing up?

07:14.670 --> 07:16.790
Maybe her silence
was a form of protest.

07:16.790 --> 07:19.540
It could be a gender bias. And Hotch
represents the establishment.

07:19.540 --> 07:22.080
Plus I'm sure she hasn't
forgotten that the BAU put her away.

07:22.380 --> 07:24.460
It could simply be about
power and control.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.170
Now, that's true. I mean, she chose
victims she could easily dominate,

07:27.170 --> 07:28.420
and even after she was arrested,

07:28.420 --> 07:30.620
she withheld information
to maintain control.

07:30.620 --> 07:32.380
So she needs to feel important.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.210
What are you thinking, Hotch?

07:38.580 --> 07:40.710
She was writing in a notebook
when I walked in.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.920
And after I introduced myself,
she turned the page and wrote this.

07:44.250 --> 07:47.330
There's an imprint of what
she was writing before on that note.

07:47.330 --> 07:48.460
Get that to the lab.

07:51.790 --> 07:53.790
I don't know why
I had to see it with my own eyes.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.460
It's completely understandable.

07:58.380 --> 07:59.830
Adam was a midfielder.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.380
Whenever there wasn't
practice or a game,

08:02.380 --> 08:04.920
he'd kick the soccer ball
by himself in the backyard.

08:07.290 --> 08:10.040
The other boy, Jimmy Bennett's family,
did they come, too?

08:10.420 --> 08:11.750
His father's on the way.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.500
I wonder if he feels as guilty as I do.

08:16.920 --> 08:19.420
-I didn't even...
-Don't beat yourself up.

08:20.580 --> 08:22.580
And don't give up hope.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.790
Hope he's still alive?

08:25.460 --> 08:27.620
Or hope you'll find a body?

08:28.670 --> 08:30.460
Hope we get some answers.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.330
Hi, Antonia.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.710
I'm agent Jennifer Jareau from the BAU.

08:38.080 --> 08:40.330
This ulcer is from diabetes.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.540
Had it over a year.

08:42.540 --> 08:44.210
Just won't heal.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.620
Doc says if it gets infected,

08:48.500 --> 08:52.830
I might just have to have my foot cut off.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.170
So, what can I do for you,

08:56.750 --> 08:59.580
Agent Jareau from the BAU?

08:59.580 --> 09:02.330
I think you know.
Will you tell me about the missing boys

09:02.330 --> 09:03.790
and who sent their clothes to you?

09:03.790 --> 09:06.580
Well, that's a heavy subject.
We just met.

09:07.710 --> 09:10.290
Why don't you tell me
something about yourself first.

09:10.920 --> 09:13.170
-What would you like to know

09:13.170 --> 09:15.380
-Western Pennsylvania.
-A country girl.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.750
-Grew up on a farm?
-Mmm-hmm.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.500
Uh-huh. Me, too.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.790
You an only child?

09:22.330 --> 09:23.420
No.

09:24.290 --> 09:25.500
I was.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.670
But I suppose it was good training
for solitary confinement.

09:29.210 --> 09:31.500
So about those clothes
that were sent to you.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.250
Those clothes. Everybody's asking me
about those clothes.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.500
It gets so tedious.

09:37.670 --> 09:39.750
They were sent by a zealous fan.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.420
Do you have any idea
how much mail I get?

09:42.670 --> 09:45.120
Ridiculous, fawning letters.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.460
I barely read 'em before I toss 'em.

09:47.460 --> 09:51.080
Well, you must have some idea
who sent the clothes to you.

09:51.500 --> 09:53.580
Did he tell you
a package was on its way?

09:54.040 --> 09:56.080
He? Well...

09:56.790 --> 09:59.120
Well, now that you mention it,
it could be Steven.

10:00.210 --> 10:02.460
Or John. Yeah. He had a crush on me.

10:03.120 --> 10:05.170
Or maybe it was Edward.

10:05.540 --> 10:07.380
Tom, Dick, or Harry.

10:09.880 --> 10:13.380
-Look, the missing boys were taken...
-How long've you been with the BAU?

10:14.330 --> 10:15.500
Eleven years.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.250
Are you respected
as much as Agent Hotchner?

10:19.960 --> 10:21.080
Yes.

10:21.330 --> 10:22.420
Really?

10:22.830 --> 10:25.040
You and he are treated
just exactly the same?

10:25.790 --> 10:28.880
Other than the fact
that he's the head of the team, yes.

10:29.120 --> 10:31.040
Well, Agent Jareau,

10:31.040 --> 10:32.830
just in the short time
that we've been speaking,

10:32.830 --> 10:36.960
I can tell that you're
very capable and intelligent.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.580
I have no doubt in my mind that
you are smarter than Agent Hotchner,

10:41.580 --> 10:44.620
so therefore you should be
head of the BAU.

10:45.830 --> 10:47.290
But you're not, are you?

10:47.960 --> 10:52.330
Because the world first and foremost
sees you as a young, attractive woman.

10:52.750 --> 10:54.120
Am I right?

10:54.790 --> 10:56.540
But if I were you,

10:57.790 --> 11:03.120
I'd just stop worrying about being nice
and well-liked and just take charge.

11:04.540 --> 11:05.830
But you're not me.

11:06.790 --> 11:09.290
No, unfortunately I'm not.

11:09.290 --> 11:13.080
I'm just old and withering
on the vine and I can barely walk.

11:14.420 --> 11:16.710
Do you know what I crave now?

11:17.420 --> 11:19.500
Comfort and familiarity.

11:20.170 --> 11:24.380
And if you do something for me,
I think I can do something for you.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.250
And what's that?

11:26.250 --> 11:30.120
Now, I know
I'm never gonna be released,

11:30.420 --> 11:35.250
but I would like a transfer back home
to a prison in Kentucky,

11:35.250 --> 11:37.790
so I can smell the bluegrass hills again.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.380
It's not possible.

11:39.790 --> 11:44.210
Well, until you can step up
and make that possible,

11:44.460 --> 11:46.710
I got nothing more to say to you.

11:52.460 --> 11:54.500
One thing I learned,
she likes being in solitary.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.620
I'm pretty sure she tries
to get sent there.

11:57.040 --> 12:00.080
So why ask for a transfer now?
She never has before.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.920
She knows she has leverage.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.880
What if it's to escape?
I mean, she had a road map in her cell.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.290
Well, she'd need outside help.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.460
Given her devotees,
that isn't hard to find.

12:08.460 --> 12:11.080
She even had inside help
when she tried escaping before,

12:11.080 --> 12:13.000
from two other inmates
and a new prison guard.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.830
-This could be another attempt.
-

12:14.830 --> 12:16.580
Penelope.
-At your service.

12:16.920 --> 12:20.380
Oh. Hey, uh, did you get the mail
and visitor records from the prison?

12:20.380 --> 12:24.250
Yeah. She was not lying when she said
she has mucho numeros fans.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.290
She gets about four to five letters
a week, mostly from men.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.290
Who knew there were
so many male hybristophiles?

12:28.290 --> 12:29.710
Has she ever written any of them back?

12:29.710 --> 12:32.120
No. She's only written one letter,
back in 2000,

12:32.120 --> 12:35.380
to the editor of a newspaper,
claiming libel.

12:35.710 --> 12:39.420
Apparently they claimed she admitted
to killing those runaway teens,

12:39.420 --> 12:41.500
saying they were a scourge to society.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.120
So she's an extreme narcissist.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.620
She wants to control
exactly how she's perceived.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.420
Female narcissists have a need
to feel superior to others.

12:48.420 --> 12:50.790
I'd expect her to love
the adulation from the groupies,

12:50.790 --> 12:52.880
so it's sort of shocking
that she's ignored them all.

12:53.210 --> 12:54.330
What if she hasn't?

12:54.330 --> 12:57.710
Maybe she has sent letters back
but not through official channels

12:57.710 --> 12:59.500
because she knew there'd be a record.

12:59.500 --> 13:03.580
We need a list of everyone in the prison
who's had regular contact with Antonia.

13:03.920 --> 13:06.420
Guards, medical personnel,
other inmates before she was

13:06.420 --> 13:07.830
-in solitary confinement.
-

13:07.830 --> 13:08.920
I'm on that.

13:09.290 --> 13:12.960
Lab has an imprint of the letter Antonia
was writing when Hotch showed up.

13:14.080 --> 13:17.080
"When I think that proof alone
will never beat faulty logic,

13:17.080 --> 13:19.580
"I bleed twice, once for myself

13:19.580 --> 13:21.750
"and once for the others
who suffer beside me.

13:22.290 --> 13:26.880
"So I rely on the sound of rain
to relieve the monotony of my days."

13:28.460 --> 13:30.540
I gotta say, it sounds pretty innocuous.

13:30.540 --> 13:33.380
Well, one thing is certain.
She's writing to someone.

13:33.710 --> 13:35.580
Her letters are leaving
the prison somehow.

13:35.580 --> 13:37.170
There's something
strange about this.

13:37.170 --> 13:39.460
The language feels
stilted and too formal.

13:39.460 --> 13:40.620
It could be a code.

13:40.620 --> 13:43.710
I agree, although it's more likely
a cipher with a symmetrical key.

13:43.710 --> 13:44.960
You think you could break it?

13:45.540 --> 13:47.380
Not yet. I'm gonna talk to her.

13:56.040 --> 13:57.830
My name is Dr. Spencer Reid.

13:57.830 --> 14:00.040
This is a copy of a letter
you wrote earlier.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.710
What happened to the original?

14:01.710 --> 14:03.040
Oh, my.

14:03.040 --> 14:04.830
You're not terribly bright, are you?

14:05.420 --> 14:08.750
I threw it out.
It's been incinerated by now. Poof.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.460
I know there's a cipher in it.

14:10.460 --> 14:12.420
You wouldn't have gone
to that much trouble to destroy it...

14:12.420 --> 14:16.080
You've got everyone fooled,
don't you, calling yourself doctor?

14:16.080 --> 14:18.250
Who is this for,
and who helped you send it?

14:18.250 --> 14:21.000
You're really a phony,
a puffed up little fraud.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.210
Is that why you're sad?

14:24.500 --> 14:26.540
I know what you're doing
and it won't work.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.040
You're treating us all
in the opposite way

14:29.040 --> 14:30.210
that we're used to being treated

14:30.210 --> 14:32.080
because you want to throw
my team off balance.

14:32.080 --> 14:33.580
You're not a complete idiot.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.960
I still think you look sad. Why is that?

14:36.380 --> 14:38.670
-Because two boys are missing.
-No.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.670
It goes deeper than that.

14:41.750 --> 14:45.710
I haven't seen it in a while,
but it looks very much like... Grief?

14:47.040 --> 14:48.460
Who'd you lose?

14:49.170 --> 14:50.620
Someone in your family?

14:51.920 --> 14:53.170
A good friend?

14:54.750 --> 14:55.830
Ah.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.750
What's your friend's name?

15:02.710 --> 15:04.880
Don't you want to know
about the missing boys?

15:06.920 --> 15:08.960
Derek Morgan. We worked together.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.460
Derek Morgan.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.830
I'm guessing you have to suppress
your grief around your teammates

15:15.830 --> 15:18.290
because they aren't quite as affected.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.120
They didn't lose a protector, did they?

15:22.420 --> 15:23.790
What about the boys?

15:23.790 --> 15:26.710
You've lost protectors before,
haven't you?

15:28.620 --> 15:31.710
That's what makes it so hard,
history repeating itself.

15:32.920 --> 15:36.540
Well, now we got
that out of the way...

15:37.500 --> 15:39.330
Give me the letter.

15:40.750 --> 15:42.170
Don't you want to know the cipher key?

15:42.420 --> 15:43.670
I'll show you.

15:46.250 --> 15:48.830
It's okay. Relax.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.210
They took away my pencils.

15:59.790 --> 16:02.380
This is the man you're looking for.

16:10.000 --> 16:12.500
And by the way, in case
you were wondering,

16:12.920 --> 16:16.500
those boys are still alive.
But for how long?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.620
Off you go, little Spencer.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.210
Adam, wake up.

16:30.670 --> 16:31.830
Adam!

16:32.960 --> 16:34.210
You okay?

16:36.080 --> 16:37.620
It's so cold.

16:39.210 --> 16:40.710
I'm digging a tunnel, okay?

16:41.540 --> 16:42.830
I'm gonna get us out of here.

16:43.290 --> 16:44.670
- -

16:45.540 --> 16:46.960
He's coming.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.290
- -

17:16.960 --> 17:18.670
She wrote "CH" in my hand,

17:18.670 --> 17:21.210
but there's no one in the mail
or visitor logs with those initials.

17:21.210 --> 17:22.540
We were talking
about the letter at the time,

17:22.540 --> 17:24.540
so it could have something
to do with the cipher.

17:24.540 --> 17:27.000
Hey, so we checked
with the Roanoke post office.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.670
We showed them photos of Antonia's
Virginia-based fans. Still nothing.

17:30.790 --> 17:32.420
Let's think about the UnSub.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.460
We know he's one of her followers.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.830
It's plausible he sent
the clothes to impress her.

17:36.830 --> 17:38.790
He kidnapped the boys
just to get her attention?

17:38.790 --> 17:41.380
We talked about someone
trying to replicate one of her crimes.

17:41.380 --> 17:43.750
She never held two boys
captive for a long period, though.

17:44.080 --> 17:48.170
No, but Antonia picked up
two boys at the same time.

17:48.750 --> 17:49.960
One of them escaped.

17:50.420 --> 17:51.670
Hector Ramon.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.080
He and another runaway
he befriended, Sam Meckler,

17:54.080 --> 17:55.960
called a hotline one night

17:55.960 --> 17:58.120
when the temperature
dropped below freezing.

17:58.120 --> 18:01.170
Yeah. It says Hector described her
as a loving mother at first.

18:01.170 --> 18:03.580
Uh, she made soup and sandwiches...

18:05.080 --> 18:08.500
"I had a warm bed
to sleep in for the first time in a year."

18:08.750 --> 18:11.250
But after a week or so,
she changed.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.880
She would get mad about small things.

18:13.880 --> 18:15.790
If we left the cap off the toothpaste,

18:15.790 --> 18:17.880
or spilled something, she would say,

18:17.880 --> 18:19.830
"You're old enough
to understand the rules.

18:20.380 --> 18:22.750
"You must atone when you break them."

18:23.920 --> 18:26.750
"Pretty soon I knew she wasn't
the nice lady she pretended to be,

18:26.750 --> 18:28.250
"and she wouldn't let us leave."

18:28.250 --> 18:29.380
When did he escape?

18:29.380 --> 18:30.750
Three weeks after they arrived.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.380
His friend Sam
was too scared to leave with him

18:32.380 --> 18:34.880
and ended up being
Antonia's last victim.

18:35.170 --> 18:37.170
We need to talk to Antonia again,

18:37.540 --> 18:39.330
but I think we've been
approaching this wrong.

18:39.330 --> 18:42.250
It's time we use her rules against her.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.670
I just talked to the prison.

18:44.670 --> 18:46.460
They're looking at inmates
and personnel who've had

18:46.460 --> 18:48.290
regular contact with Antonia Slade.

18:48.290 --> 18:52.120
One guard in particular, Orel Wilbur,
has had more contact than anyone.

18:52.120 --> 18:55.960
He's picked up extra shifts
in units where Antonia has been held,

18:55.960 --> 18:59.790
and this week he volunteered
to fill in for a sick guard in solitary.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.170
That can't be a coincidence.

19:02.420 --> 19:05.580
Antonia Slade sent mail
out of prison that was never logged.

19:05.580 --> 19:07.170
Someone had to help her do that.

19:08.710 --> 19:12.080
We have video footage
of you outside of her cell yesterday,

19:12.080 --> 19:15.170
and it looks to me like you purposely
blocked her from view of the camera.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.830
Was that so she could slip you a letter?

19:19.290 --> 19:20.580
It's not what you think.

19:20.830 --> 19:23.000
Her letters were all harmless.
I read them.

19:23.460 --> 19:25.210
I wouldn't send them
if I thought they were dangerous.

19:25.210 --> 19:26.460
Who were the letters for?

19:27.420 --> 19:29.750
Different men. Her fans, I guess.

19:29.750 --> 19:30.960
Why did you help her?

19:31.380 --> 19:33.710
-Do you like her, romantically?
-No.

19:34.210 --> 19:36.080
I'm not one of those sickos
who idolize her.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.620
Well, then why do it

19:41.290 --> 19:43.540
-It's complicated.
-I think I can keep up.

19:46.880 --> 19:50.620
Antonia has a lot of influence
in the prison.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.620
Other inmates respect her.
They're also scared of her.

19:54.620 --> 19:55.960
Do you know what I think?

19:55.960 --> 19:58.330
I think there is another
inmate that you do like,

19:58.580 --> 20:01.500
and Antonia protects your friend
as long as you send her mail.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.420
Am I right?

20:05.460 --> 20:08.040
Yesterday you sent a letter.
Who was it for?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.380
John Smith.

20:17.540 --> 20:20.380
Good afternoon. I'm FBI Agent Rossi.

20:20.380 --> 20:23.080
This is Dr. Lewis. We're with the BAU.

20:25.170 --> 20:26.920
Midday slump, huh?

20:27.380 --> 20:28.710
Yeah, I get that, too.

20:28.960 --> 20:31.170
Right about the time of day
I need a gallon of coffee.

20:31.460 --> 20:35.120
What is so difficult about
following one simple rule?

20:35.540 --> 20:38.250
Oh, you mean seeing us one at a time?

20:38.250 --> 20:40.920
Yeah. Sorry.
That's not gonna work for us anymore.

20:41.500 --> 20:44.000
We're here because we have
just one question for you.

20:45.420 --> 20:47.170
Who is John Smith?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.420
Hmm.

20:50.460 --> 20:52.250
I don't think she's gonna talk to us.

20:53.460 --> 20:54.670
Guard!

20:55.170 --> 20:56.540
I'm not surprised.

20:56.540 --> 20:59.080
Gideon said the reason
she never spoke about the murders

20:59.080 --> 21:02.380
was that she was all hat, no cattle.

21:02.790 --> 21:04.040
Hmm. How so?

21:04.710 --> 21:08.040
Well, her lover, Phil Garmin,
was the brains behind the operation.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.920
The runaway hotline was all his idea.

21:10.170 --> 21:12.040
Hmm. Pedophile?

21:12.330 --> 21:15.000
Gideon thought so.
Antonia was just a helper.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.830
She'd bring him victims.

21:17.250 --> 21:18.540
Why not just admit that?

21:18.540 --> 21:20.670
Well, she'd lose her power
and mystique.

21:21.290 --> 21:23.580
That's all she has, especially now.

21:23.580 --> 21:27.380
She protects herself by making
people think she's dangerous.

21:27.830 --> 21:30.580
I should include that in my
research paper on vicarious killers.

21:31.830 --> 21:33.290
What is taking so long?

21:36.460 --> 21:37.960
Gideon was a fool.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.380
Excuse me?

21:42.250 --> 21:43.920
Phil was not a pedophile.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.790
He had nothing to do
with those children.

21:48.540 --> 21:49.670
Oh.

21:50.210 --> 21:51.710
I know who you are now.

21:52.040 --> 21:54.710
You're David Rossi. You started BAU.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.000
I read your books.
You're a bigger fool than Gideon was.

21:58.880 --> 22:00.380
And Dr. Lewis,

22:00.380 --> 22:03.170
what are you, some sort
of forensic psychologist?

22:03.170 --> 22:05.420
Yes. I study serial killers.

22:05.750 --> 22:07.540
I bet you'd love to interview me.

22:07.540 --> 22:08.920
Actually, no.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.290
I mean, I do want to find out
as much as I can about this case,

22:11.290 --> 22:14.420
but as a research subject,
you don't interest me.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.000
No offense.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.420
You intrigue me.

22:19.790 --> 22:22.880
If you get me a transfer to Kentucky,
I will reveal all to you.

22:23.120 --> 22:24.670
I don't think so.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.710
You tell us where
those missing boys are

22:26.710 --> 22:28.880
and then maybe
we can talk about a transfer.

22:29.330 --> 22:32.790
Dr. Lewis, why don't you
and I talk alone.

22:32.790 --> 22:34.790
I think we can work something out.

22:38.120 --> 22:40.830
It's important for Antonia
to feel dominant.

22:40.830 --> 22:43.670
She establishes this
by setting precise rules.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.710
It means she wouldn't engage in a
long-term relationship with the UnSub

22:46.710 --> 22:50.540
if he wasn't submissive or detail-
oriented enough to follow these rules.

22:50.540 --> 22:53.000
Her former partner Phil Garmin
fit that model perfectly.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.710
He was an accountant, who, according
to acquaintances, was robotic.

22:56.120 --> 22:58.790
After he met Antonia,
he had no other social contacts.

22:58.790 --> 23:01.830
So the UnSub we're looking for
is very similar to Phil,

23:02.250 --> 23:05.960
a loner who is emotionally dependent
on Antonia and waits for her direction.

23:06.330 --> 23:11.670
Okay. I have managed to narrow down
the John Smiths in Virginia

23:12.080 --> 23:15.620
from 2,780 people

23:15.620 --> 23:20.170
down to 1,900 by eliminating
anyone over the age of 70

23:20.170 --> 23:23.580
and anyone under the age of 18.
But I still need more parameters.

23:24.330 --> 23:26.000
John Smith has to be a pseudonym.

23:26.420 --> 23:28.330
The guard said that Antonia
wrote to different men,

23:28.330 --> 23:31.460
but what if it was
the same man using different aliases?

23:31.460 --> 23:33.960
That's possible,
but it doesn't hurt to keep looking.

23:34.790 --> 23:37.040
Garcia, try single men who live alone

23:37.040 --> 23:40.080
and have a profession that
requires attention to detail.

23:40.710 --> 23:42.960
Healthcare, science, math.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.920
Forging ahead with surgical precision.

24:07.080 --> 24:10.000
Now that I have you alone,
tell me something about yourself.

24:10.620 --> 24:12.250
-Such as?
-I don't know.

24:12.670 --> 24:14.420
A little morsel from your childhood.

24:15.670 --> 24:16.830
Okay.

24:18.540 --> 24:22.380
When I was nine and my father was still
in the army, we moved to Germany.

24:23.380 --> 24:26.000
A lot of kids there
had never seen a black child before.

24:26.380 --> 24:30.670
One of them was a bully who used to
follow me and taunt me in the halls.

24:31.420 --> 24:34.960
One day I got to school and I saw he
had drawn a swastika on my locker.

24:36.420 --> 24:39.330
I reported him to the principal,
and because of that,

24:39.330 --> 24:41.620
him and two of his buddies jumped me
the next day after school.

24:42.710 --> 24:47.790
And I was in the hospital for three days
with a concussion and broken ribs.

24:50.040 --> 24:53.330
That is a very compelling
piece of fiction.

24:55.120 --> 24:59.540
I believe you lived in Germany, but I
don't think that story happened to you.

25:01.040 --> 25:05.040
Why would a bully need two more
people to beat up on one little girl?

25:06.540 --> 25:08.250
See, when I was a therapist,

25:08.250 --> 25:11.710
I learned that when somebody's
story doesn't make sense,

25:11.710 --> 25:13.170
it's because they're lying.

25:14.330 --> 25:15.960
All right, let's cut to the chase.

25:16.460 --> 25:19.210
I need information that only you have.

25:19.620 --> 25:21.380
So what do you really want from me?

25:21.380 --> 25:23.790
Now there's the real Dr. Lewis.

25:24.330 --> 25:27.170
Someone who's not afraid,
who was never bullied.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.750
What do I want from you? The truth.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.330
I'll give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

25:36.170 --> 25:39.500
A version of that story
happened to somebody close to you.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.920
Who was it?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.750
You're wasting time.

25:47.170 --> 25:50.040
I don't know how much longer
those boys are gonna last.

25:53.120 --> 25:54.380
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.920
Lab says the dried blood is canine
and the stains are about five days old.

25:58.580 --> 25:59.960
So the UnSub staged it.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.790
Was it to impress Antonia
or was it at her behest?

26:02.790 --> 26:03.960
Well, if the UnSub did it,

26:03.960 --> 26:05.330
it would be a dramatic way
to get her attention.

26:05.330 --> 26:07.460
If she did it, it would
be a way to get ours.

26:08.670 --> 26:10.330
Adam's mother wanted to stay,

26:10.330 --> 26:12.460
and I didn't have the heart
to ask her to leave.

26:12.460 --> 26:14.420
I figured no one's using
Morgan's old office yet.

26:14.420 --> 26:15.920
- -Good idea.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.830
Reid just broke the cipher.

26:20.790 --> 26:23.790
I thought that Antonia
had written the initials "CH" in my hand.

26:24.210 --> 26:27.880
What she actually wrote was "C++",
which is a programming language

26:27.880 --> 26:30.080
that uses hexadecimal code,
or base sixteen,

26:30.380 --> 26:32.420
now, that means that
the UnSub is most likely

26:32.420 --> 26:34.580
a programmer or at least
someone who works with computers.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.000
Anyway, using an ASCII chart,
you can translate

26:37.000 --> 26:38.920
between hexadecimal code
and character equivalents,

26:38.920 --> 26:41.920
but the interesting thing
is the entire letter isn't the message.

26:41.920 --> 26:44.500
The actual message is hidden
in a single sentence

26:44.500 --> 26:46.920
that's indicated by
the number underlined in the date.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.000
So the fourth sentence.
REID: Exactly.

26:49.000 --> 26:54.250
"When I think that truth alone will
never beat faulty logic, I bleed twice."

26:54.500 --> 26:55.880
Now, if you count the letters
in each word,

26:55.880 --> 26:58.460
you get a hexadecimal code which
can then be translated into characters.

26:58.830 --> 27:01.210
Kid, just tell us what it says.

27:02.000 --> 27:04.460
"Atone full moon."

27:04.460 --> 27:06.290
Atone on the full moon?

27:06.290 --> 27:07.500
The full moon is tonight.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.790
36 p.m., which means
we have less than five hours.

27:11.290 --> 27:14.330
-The UnSub's gonna kill those kids.
-We have no idea where he is.

27:14.790 --> 27:16.290
Antonia does.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.500
We have to give her what she wants.

27:24.710 --> 27:25.960
Get up!

27:28.960 --> 27:30.290
-You, too.
-Adam's sick.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.500
-He can die here, then.
-No! He's okay.

27:35.210 --> 27:36.830
Come on, Adam, get up.

27:38.710 --> 27:40.830
Let's go! We're leaving!

28:25.460 --> 28:28.380
So is this the private jet
for all inmates or just me?

28:29.750 --> 28:32.380
Well, you're not special,
if that's what you're asking.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.830
I don't want you to think that I'm
ungrateful for this prison transfer,

28:36.830 --> 28:38.460
so I'm gonna share something with you.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.750
The man you're looking for
is trying to duplicate the circumstances

28:44.750 --> 28:46.750
of the two boys I crossed paths with.

28:47.330 --> 28:49.040
Yeah, we figured that out already.

28:50.620 --> 28:53.500
You told us you'd give us
his location if we transferred you.

28:55.080 --> 28:58.580
Ah, I don't know exactly
where he is at the moment.

29:00.790 --> 29:03.380
Other than mentioning
the Bluegrass Hills,

29:03.830 --> 29:06.830
did she talk about
any other connection to Kentucky?

29:06.830 --> 29:08.880
She told JJ she grew up on a farm.

29:09.420 --> 29:11.750
She said she wants to go home,
but somehow,

29:12.040 --> 29:14.620
she doesn't strike me
as the sentimental type.

29:15.500 --> 29:17.000
Why the transfer?

29:18.080 --> 29:19.620
What if that's where the UnSub is?

29:20.170 --> 29:21.880
She wants to witness the murders.

29:33.380 --> 29:35.880
Mister. Mister.

29:36.380 --> 29:37.920
Adam threw up.

29:53.670 --> 29:54.920
All right, thanks, Reid.

29:55.170 --> 29:57.290
The UnSub's on his way
to Kentucky or he's already there.

29:57.750 --> 30:00.250
What if the UnSub is someone
from her earlier life in Kentucky,

30:00.250 --> 30:03.000
back when she was a social
worker or maybe even her childhood?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.960
But the letters were sent
to the UnSub in Roanoke.

30:05.960 --> 30:08.420
The package with the clothes
came from Roanoke.

30:08.420 --> 30:11.170
Well, it's possible that he moved
to western Virginia to be close to her.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.920
Look into all of her past relationships,
professional and personal.

30:13.920 --> 30:15.040
Copy that.

30:17.080 --> 30:19.000
You single, Dr. Lewis?

30:20.290 --> 30:21.620
Why do you want to know?

30:22.080 --> 30:25.120
Just wondering if there was
anybody you share everything with.

30:28.790 --> 30:31.460
I think you're like me.
Nobody really knows us.

30:52.290 --> 30:57.040
He's bringing the children to Kentucky,
right outside Lexington.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.960
Yes, yes, yes. I got a name.

31:05.250 --> 31:07.580
-It is one of Antonia's early patients
-

31:07.580 --> 31:09.750
when she first started
as a social worker in Kentucky.

31:09.750 --> 31:12.580
Claude Barlow. He saw her
twice a week for three years.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.830
Then she moved to Virginia.
He followed her here.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.750
He showed up at her
new place of employment,

31:17.750 --> 31:21.540
the Center for Social Services,
multiple times, hoping to speak to her.

31:21.540 --> 31:23.170
-And did he?
-Uh, that's unclear.

31:23.170 --> 31:25.460
The center filed a restraining order
barring him from the premises

31:25.460 --> 31:26.670
for threatening and erratic behavior.

31:26.670 --> 31:28.000
And that seemed to work,
'cause he disappeared

31:28.000 --> 31:29.880
until a month after
her murder conviction.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.830
Then, she showed up at the prison
under the alias Peter Evans,

31:32.830 --> 31:34.500
hoping to speak to her but she refused.

31:34.500 --> 31:35.920
This could be extreme transference.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.500
As a patient, he had a pathological
attachment to his therapist.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.880
And he couldn't move on
after she terminated the therapy.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.460
I'm guessing Antonia
encouraged the dependence.

31:43.710 --> 31:46.170
Not only that, he has a history
of dangerous behavior.

31:46.420 --> 31:48.710
She could be purposely fueling that.

31:53.250 --> 31:55.250
Okay, Aaron, we're about to land.

31:57.210 --> 31:59.040
Where's Claude Barlow going?

31:59.040 --> 32:00.750
Oh, good, you know his real name.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.920
I wasn't quite sure
what he goes by these days.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.080
It's always changing.

32:04.080 --> 32:05.880
41. We don't have time for games.

32:08.210 --> 32:10.920
There's no address where Claude is,
but I can take you there.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.540
However, I do have one more request.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.580
Check this out.

32:19.580 --> 32:21.670
It's a home business run by
Peter Evans,

32:21.670 --> 32:23.830
AKA Claude Barlow, in Roanoke.

32:23.830 --> 32:25.580
Didn't boy wonder say
he'd worked with computers?

32:25.580 --> 32:26.830
-That's gotta be him.
-

32:26.830 --> 32:28.750
I'll go check it out,
see if he left any clues behind.

32:29.000 --> 32:30.170
What have you got, Dave?

32:31.040 --> 32:33.290
Undo my chains, Agent Rossi.

32:35.330 --> 32:37.040
Look at me. I can't run away.

32:37.540 --> 32:39.040
Why is it so important to you?

32:39.710 --> 32:41.380
A little taste of freedom.-

32:42.170 --> 32:44.170
Probably the last one I'll ever have.

32:46.880 --> 32:48.290
And if we don't?

32:50.380 --> 32:53.290
Well, you can take me
straight to the new prison.

32:53.290 --> 32:55.380
I'll leave the heroics to you.

32:57.830 --> 32:58.920
Stand by, Dave.

32:59.540 --> 33:01.250
Do you have an address in
Kentucky for Claude Barlow?

33:01.250 --> 33:02.290
Uh...

33:03.210 --> 33:06.620
The house he grew up in
has changed owners twice since he left,

33:06.620 --> 33:08.290
and I have nothing for Antonia either.

33:09.380 --> 33:10.750
Dave, do what she says.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.210
Understood.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.880
Don't get comfortable.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.460
My Glock's gonna be on you
the entire time.

33:27.880 --> 33:30.000
I wouldn't have it any other way.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.330
Out.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.620
It's time to meet your master.

33:50.500 --> 33:52.790
Well, you got your wish. Where to?

33:52.790 --> 33:54.500
Take Highway 60 and head east.

33:57.710 --> 34:00.670
This is so exciting,
I feel like one of the team right now.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.210
You shouldn't.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.620
Maybe I can replace Agent Morgan.

34:10.830 --> 34:12.210
All right, thanks, JJ.

34:12.460 --> 34:13.830
Peter Evans' place was empty,

34:13.830 --> 34:15.540
but it looks like he was
holding the boys there.

34:15.540 --> 34:17.250
Okay. And I looked into
the New Days clinic.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.920
That's where Antonia
first met Claude Barlow.

34:19.250 --> 34:20.420
It's been shut down for years,

34:20.420 --> 34:22.210
but the building has never
been leased since

34:22.210 --> 34:23.960
because of a radon leak underground.

34:24.290 --> 34:26.000
-So it's empty.
-Yeah.

34:26.000 --> 34:29.080
Well, it has significance to the UnSub.
It's likely he would take the boys there.

34:32.420 --> 34:33.580
What do you have, Hotch?

34:33.580 --> 34:36.880
We think he's taking them
to 8879 Rincon Street.

34:37.540 --> 34:42.540
There's a possible address
for Claude Barlow. 8879 Rincon Street.

34:42.540 --> 34:45.170
The New Days Clinic? He's not there.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.250
They're driving in
the opposite direction of that building.

34:49.120 --> 34:50.500
She could be playing us.

34:50.500 --> 34:52.250
Pull over. We need to turn around.

34:54.170 --> 34:56.960
You better keep going.
I'm telling you, he's not at the clinic.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.250
We used to take walks
during our sessions.

34:59.540 --> 35:02.170
I'm taking you to his favorite place.

35:02.170 --> 35:03.920
55.

35:04.540 --> 35:06.830
If you go to the clinic,
you're gonna miss saving those kids.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.830
Maybe that's been
your intention all along.

35:10.830 --> 35:14.460
Just ahead there's a dirt road
on the right. You better take that road.

35:15.750 --> 35:18.290
If you all thought I was coming
here to witness the murders,

35:18.290 --> 35:20.670
why would I be going
to so much trouble to miss it?

35:22.540 --> 35:24.040
We're gonna keep going, Hotch.

36:02.250 --> 36:04.040
You're okay. You're okay.
We've got you.

36:04.040 --> 36:05.380
There's no one else here.

36:05.380 --> 36:06.960
He took Adam.

36:10.580 --> 36:12.290
Okay. Okay. Okay.

36:15.580 --> 36:17.380
Show us where you would take Claude.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.210
Let's go.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.620
There's a trail...
Devil's Backbone.

36:32.420 --> 36:33.580
Wait!

36:34.500 --> 36:36.040
It's that way.

36:45.750 --> 36:47.750
Let's go!

36:47.750 --> 36:50.000
Claude Barlow, FBI,
drop the weapon!

36:50.330 --> 36:52.380
-Where's Antonia?
-Let the boy go.

36:52.710 --> 36:53.880
Did you bring her?

36:53.880 --> 36:56.620
She led us to you in order to stop you.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.880
Put the gun down.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.670
Shut up! Where is she?

37:00.670 --> 37:02.380
Antonia!

37:02.380 --> 37:04.120
No.

37:04.120 --> 37:07.670
We don't want to hurt you, Claude.
Let Adam go.

37:08.620 --> 37:10.790
He's dead unless I see her.

37:23.580 --> 37:25.250
Hey, Claude.

37:27.500 --> 37:28.830
You came.

37:32.710 --> 37:34.380
I want you to listen real carefully.

37:34.620 --> 37:36.040
I got something to tell you.

37:37.670 --> 37:39.170
But first...

37:44.120 --> 37:45.420
It was all for you.

37:45.710 --> 37:47.830
-I did everything you said.
-I know.

38:53.250 --> 38:56.420
"No man really knows
about other human beings.

38:56.670 --> 38:59.960
"The best he can do is
to suppose that they are like himself."

39:00.330 --> 39:01.920
John Steinbeck.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.120
I think I smell the cherry blossoms.

39:07.040 --> 39:08.380
Yeah, me, too.

39:09.250 --> 39:11.880
You were never really
gonna transfer me, were you?

39:12.120 --> 39:15.120
No. But you knew that, didn't you?

39:18.290 --> 39:20.540
I hope they haven't changed
my old cell.

39:23.670 --> 39:26.210
Jimmy Bennett's father beat the odds
and actually got off drugs.

39:26.210 --> 39:28.330
He's petitioning the court
to regain full custody.

39:29.420 --> 39:31.960
So there's still one thing
I don't understand.

39:31.960 --> 39:35.580
We know Antonia told Claude
to send the clothes,

39:35.580 --> 39:37.420
which then got our
attention, but why now?

39:37.750 --> 39:40.080
The boys were getting older.
He couldn't hold them much longer.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.540
And don't forget boredom.

39:41.540 --> 39:43.670
I mean, she had a really
exciting couple of days there.

39:44.120 --> 39:45.960
Not to brag, but we are
more scintillating

39:45.960 --> 39:47.750
company than most
inmates and guards.

39:48.000 --> 39:50.330
I overheard the arrangement
you made with Antonia in German.

39:50.330 --> 39:53.380
You promised to tell her the truth after
the case was over if she helped us out.

39:53.830 --> 39:55.500
-You gonna follow through?
-Hell, no.

39:55.830 --> 39:58.460
Look, of all the serial killer types,
the ones I find most dangerous

39:58.460 --> 40:01.120
are the hyper-intelligent ones
that get off more on the mind games

40:01.120 --> 40:02.290
than the killing.

40:02.290 --> 40:05.120
They're like vampires
ready to suck your soul dry

40:05.120 --> 40:06.920
and file your information
away for a rainy day.

40:07.420 --> 40:08.620
That's Antonia.

40:08.620 --> 40:10.210
Well, we got what we wanted from her.

40:10.210 --> 40:11.920
I say we move on.

40:18.330 --> 40:19.920
Agent Hotchner.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.380
Hello, Antonia.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.080
Well, this is a surprise.

40:23.540 --> 40:26.080
You here to give me a medal
for helping you save those boys?

40:26.080 --> 40:27.250
No.

40:27.250 --> 40:30.380
That must be because
you can't stand being ignored, is that it?

40:30.960 --> 40:33.120
-That's not it.
-I don't believe you.

40:33.380 --> 40:36.580
You know what everyone in this world
wants even more than love?

40:37.790 --> 40:39.080
Respect.

40:39.460 --> 40:41.580
Claude may have kidnapped
those boys on his own,

40:42.670 --> 40:45.540
but you set the events of the last few
days in motion for a reason.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.710
And you want me to tell you what it is.

40:47.710 --> 40:48.960
Well...

40:49.790 --> 40:52.540
You're gonna have to prove you
got a little bit more going on

40:52.540 --> 40:55.880
than a fancy title and nice suits
to deserve an answer.

40:59.920 --> 41:01.210
When you were fourteen,

41:02.830 --> 41:06.670
you missed almost a year of school
due to an unspecified illness.

41:08.670 --> 41:09.790
During the same year,

41:09.790 --> 41:11.580
a 15-year-old boy
on a neighboring farm

41:11.580 --> 41:13.040
was killed in a hunting accident.

41:14.380 --> 41:16.170
I think these two events were related.

41:18.210 --> 41:20.580
You weren't ill, you were pregnant.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.080
And the neighbor boy
was the father of your child.

41:25.580 --> 41:28.290
Your father, the German minister,
the authoritarian,

41:28.290 --> 41:30.540
punished you for breaking the rules.

41:32.210 --> 41:34.000
He made you have the baby at home,

41:35.790 --> 41:37.500
and he murdered your boyfriend.

41:39.380 --> 41:40.580
Go on.

41:40.960 --> 41:44.460
At first we profiled you as an extreme
narcissist, but that's just a cover.

41:46.670 --> 41:48.500
You're actually full of self-loathing.

41:49.750 --> 41:52.000
And every time you killed
a runaway teen,

41:52.000 --> 41:56.210
you were killing yourself
or your boyfriend for lacking discipline.

41:58.920 --> 42:00.580
What happened to your baby, Antonia?

42:01.040 --> 42:02.750
I can't tell you that.

42:02.750 --> 42:05.960
But as a reward for being so clever,
I will tell you this.

42:08.830 --> 42:11.170
There's a storm coming,
Agent Hotchner.

42:12.830 --> 42:15.330
And you're about to be swept away.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.330
TO BE CONTINUED...
