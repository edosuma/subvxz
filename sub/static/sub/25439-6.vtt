00:10.866 --> 00:13.900
You were sippin' suds
with your buds
the other day...

00:13.933 --> 00:15.133
WAYNE: Hey, Dary,
real quick.

00:15.166 --> 00:17.000
"Blank, lunch and dinner."

00:17.033 --> 00:18.566
Breh‐fekst.
Oh, boy.

00:18.600 --> 00:19.966
Can I be honest
with you guys
for a sec?

00:20.000 --> 00:21.300
Oh, careful, Dary.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.700
DAN: I'd suggest
everything you've said

00:22.733 --> 00:23.900
up until now
has been a lie.

00:23.933 --> 00:25.566
And you've said
lots of things.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.000
Like, when someone
starts a sentence

00:27.033 --> 00:28.900
with "Don't take this
the wrong way..."

00:28.933 --> 00:30.200
Guess what?
I already did.

00:30.233 --> 00:31.833
Yeah, the same thing
if people start a sentence

00:31.866 --> 00:33.766
by saying, "You're gonna
hate me for saying this..."

00:33.800 --> 00:35.300
Guess what? I already do.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.666
Or, when people
start a sentence
by saying,

00:37.700 --> 00:38.900
"You're not gonna
wanna hear this..."

00:38.933 --> 00:40.033
Guess what?
I already don't.

00:40.066 --> 00:41.766
No, it's just
an observation.

00:41.800 --> 00:43.100
Well I'm curious as to know
why you thought

00:43.133 --> 00:44.933
it required a preface.

00:44.966 --> 00:47.033
Well, because I'm aware
of how it might sound.

00:47.066 --> 00:48.500
Quit beatin'
around the bush, Dary.

00:48.533 --> 00:50.766
Yeah, Dary, I don't remember
you been such an
around‐the‐bush beater.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.300
Oh, fine, now
I'm not even gonna say it.

00:52.333 --> 00:53.866
ALL: Say it.

00:53.900 --> 00:55.633
The only thing
worse than saying,

00:55.666 --> 00:56.700
"You're not gonna
wanna hear this,"

00:56.733 --> 00:58.800
is when someone says
they have something to say,

00:58.833 --> 01:00.000
and they don't say it.

01:00.033 --> 01:02.166
You're digging
your heels in like
a 12‐year‐old girl.

01:02.200 --> 01:04.200
When in doubt, spit's it out.

01:04.233 --> 01:06.500
Okay, fine,
I'm gonna say it.
Okay, here goes.

01:07.800 --> 01:08.900
You know micro‐brewing?

01:10.566 --> 01:12.833
Like, craft beer?

01:12.866 --> 01:14.100
Yeah.

01:14.133 --> 01:17.066
I always thought
it was "craft beard,"

01:17.100 --> 01:19.600
on account of the guys
who make it always have beards.

01:21.033 --> 01:23.233
So, it was all that
for just this then, eh?

01:23.266 --> 01:26.200
Thank you for inviting us
into the circle of trust, Dary.

01:26.233 --> 01:27.800
I believe the
preferred term is,

01:27.833 --> 01:28.933
"lumbersexuals."

01:28.966 --> 01:31.133
Well, "craft beard" makes
a pocket‐load more sense.

01:31.166 --> 01:33.166
DAN: You know, craft beards
doesn't really bother me.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.566
But it's the clever wordplay
that goes into
the naming of it

01:35.600 --> 01:36.733
that I finds hard to swallow.

01:36.766 --> 01:38.966
Like, "So hoppy together,"

01:39.000 --> 01:41.066
or "Barley breathing."

01:41.100 --> 01:42.800
Now, why don't you
just call them what it is?

01:42.833 --> 01:44.300
It's fuckin' beer.
"Beer and headlights."

01:44.333 --> 01:45.766
Yeah. I'll contribute.

01:45.800 --> 01:47.033
"Ale by comparison."

01:47.066 --> 01:48.066
Stout and about.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.900
Sounds actually pretty good,
"Stout and about."

01:49.933 --> 01:51.000
Stout and about's
not bad at all, actually.

01:51.033 --> 01:52.233
I'd drink some
stout and about.

01:52.266 --> 01:54.266
I'm surprised
we're not drinking a
stout and about right now.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.833
I think what you wanna do is
you wanna put

01:55.866 --> 01:58.166
an animal in the name
'cause people love animals.

01:58.200 --> 02:00.033
Like, "Cute Koala Cream,"

02:00.066 --> 02:01.933
or "Happy Hamster Honey."

02:01.966 --> 02:03.566
No, no. What you wanna do is
you wanna put

02:03.600 --> 02:05.600
a berry in the name
'cause people love berries.

02:06.766 --> 02:08.533
"Partridge Berry Pilsner,"

02:08.566 --> 02:10.733
or "Alderberry Ale."

02:10.766 --> 02:12.833
Pleasing to the ears
and the mouth.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.200
No, Dary.
Dary, no.

02:14.233 --> 02:16.633
No, Dan. Dan, no.
No, Katy. Katy, no.

02:16.666 --> 02:17.866
What you're exposed to do,

02:17.900 --> 02:19.233
is put something
cozy in the names

02:19.266 --> 02:20.966
'cuz people like
being cozy, right?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.566
Like "toque" or "mittens."

02:22.600 --> 02:24.166
And then, if you really wanna
double down on it,

02:24.200 --> 02:25.800
you put something
outdoorsy in the name

02:25.833 --> 02:27.533
because people love
being outdoors.

02:27.566 --> 02:29.766
Like, "lake,"
or "mountains."

02:29.800 --> 02:31.300
So what it's really
gonna boil down to

02:31.333 --> 02:33.766
is "Toque Lake Brew co,"

02:33.800 --> 02:36.100
or "Mountain Mittens
Alpine Ale."

02:36.133 --> 02:38.933
"Blanket Fire Light."
There you go, Dary.

02:38.966 --> 02:40.300
The other ways
to go is to use

02:40.333 --> 02:41.800
a clever,
but ironical statement.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.500
Like, "I'm bitters."

02:44.200 --> 02:46.133
See, I'd go suggestive.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.833
Like, "Slip‐it‐in cider."

02:48.866 --> 02:50.500
Katy.
What?
