<i> East Mission, Oregon, remains under
evacuation orders at this hour,</i>

04:52.857 --> 04:54.288
<i> Just moments ago,</i>

04:54.323 --> 04:57.474
<i> the President authorized FEZA
to declare East Mission...</i>

04:57.506 --> 04:59.181
<i> a quarantine zone.</i>

04:59.358 --> 05:02.134
<i> At 10:31 this morning East Mission police...</i>

05:02.234 --> 05:05.560
<i> discovered a number a suspected
of zombie attacks,</i>

05:05.611 --> 05:08.853
<i> in separate, but contiguous locations.</i>

05:08.945 --> 05:11.560
<i> Per standard operating procedure...</i>

05:11.654 --> 05:15.005
<i> a containment wall was erected within 12 hours...</i>

05:15.170 --> 05:17.583
<i> a new FEZA record,</i>

05:17.696 --> 05:21.796
<i> This is the third zombie outbreak in
the United States in the last 10 years,</i>

05:21.820 --> 05:23.860
<i> Most residents have evacuated the city...</i>

05:23.951 --> 05:25.719
<i> as well as most civil authorities.</i>

05:25.783 --> 05:28.791
<i> Unfortunately, looting has been reported...</i>

05:28.815 --> 05:30.568
<i> inside the quarantine zone.</i>

05:31.928 --> 05:35.282
<i> At least one biker gang is operating
in East Mission.</i>

05:35.306 --> 05:38.872
<i> They are thought to be heavily armed
and extremely dangerous.</i>

05:39.305 --> 05:42.844
<i> FEZA's directing all residents
who don't own cars...</i>

05:43.001 --> 05:44.777
<i> to the East Mission Mega Dome...</i>

05:44.790 --> 05:47.041
<i> ... where they will be evacuated by bus.</i>

05:47.065 --> 05:49.855
<i> Many of them are survivors of past outbreaks...</i>

05:49.879 --> 05:51.668
<i> ... and carry the zombie virus.</i>

05:51.668 --> 05:52.949
<i> I'm gonna tell it like it is...</i>

05:52.949 --> 05:55.214
<i> No, I don't want those people
getting out of there.</i>

05:55.253 --> 05:56.824
<i> I don't want to be infected.</i>

06:03.547 --> 06:05.650
<i> We apologize for the delay.</i>

06:05.674 --> 06:07.690
<i> All individuals requiring Zombrex,</i>

06:07.840 --> 06:11.558
<i> please line at least up one hour before
your scheduled injection.</i>

06:14.050 --> 06:17.196
<i> Evacuation buses are expected shortly.</i>

06:17.220 --> 06:20.805
<i> Again, we apologize for the delay
and thank you for your patience.</i>

06:20.805 --> 06:27.800
(No dialog)

06:29.952 --> 06:31.759
Not a goddamn zombie in sight.

06:32.302 --> 06:34.088
This is Chase Carter,

06:34.180 --> 06:35.990
his wasting time and yours...

06:36.466 --> 06:38.680
from False Alarmville, USA...

06:41.232 --> 06:42.600
<i> Any time now.</i>

06:44.091 --> 06:45.880
OK, let's do this.

06:47.296 --> 06:48.292
You look beautiful.

06:50.712 --> 06:52.646
<i> Chase Carter here
for Hit Point Digital</i>

06:52.670 --> 06:55.222
<i> reporting from inside
the quarantine zone.</i>

06:55.246 --> 06:58.528
<i> Now this may well be the worst run
government operation since Katrina,</i>

06:58.552 --> 07:00.800
We're here at the Mega Dome
evacuation center,

07:00.822 --> 07:02.535
<i> where there are no buses,</i>

07:02.559 --> 07:04.119
<i> no food, and no water.</i>

07:04.143 --> 07:06.286
<i> The only thing people here
can be thankful for...</i>

07:06.310 --> 07:08.541
<i> ...is that there are as yet,
zombies don't either.</i>

07:08.565 --> 07:10.472
<i> Now, many of those abandoned here...</i>

07:10.496 --> 07:11.976
<i> ... are survivors of past outbreaks,</i>

07:12.000 --> 07:12.671
Excuse me.

07:12.693 --> 07:15.520
For them, East Mission
is a kind of community for people...

07:15.544 --> 07:17.280
... infected with the zombie virus.

07:17.304 --> 07:18.984
With no evacuation in sight,

07:19.025 --> 07:21.100
<i> they depend on the tents
behind this fence...</i>

07:21.273 --> 07:22.958
... and the drugs inside,

07:23.233 --> 07:25.640
<i> to quite literally remain human.</i>

07:27.181 --> 07:28.966
<i> I'm putting myself asleep.</i>

07:28.990 --> 07:30.746
<i> This story has been done.</i>

07:30.770 --> 07:32.986
We're not going to get a million plus hits
talking about tents.

07:33.010 --> 07:36.103
Alright, then so let's talk about people.
Let's tell their story.

07:36.127 --> 07:37.934
Nobody cares about these people...

07:37.958 --> 07:39.310
... unless they're eating other people.

07:39.810 --> 07:40.960
Fine,

07:41.316 --> 07:44.825
You look like shit, man.
Whatever.

07:46.509 --> 07:47.671
Mind you...

07:48.775 --> 07:50.281
They might care about her.

07:50.758 --> 07:52.467
Oh, com'on!

07:52.640 --> 07:54.602
Watch me take this chick viral.

07:55.664 --> 07:57.241
<i> Yeah, It's always the pretty ones,</i>

07:57.563 --> 07:59.407
Excuse me.
Hi.

07:59.431 --> 08:01.130
Chase Carter, Hit Point Digital.

08:02.227 --> 08:03.591
Can I ask you a few questions?

08:03.717 --> 08:06.303
- On camera?
-I'm not interested.

08:06.327 --> 08:07.505
Really?

08:07.634 --> 08:09.659
This is your chance to tell your government...

08:09.683 --> 08:11.147
... How you feel about being abandoned.

08:11.371 --> 08:12.566
Stuck here...

08:12.957 --> 08:14.151
... next to them.

08:16.165 --> 08:17.811
Anything you want to say.

08:21.662 --> 08:22.870
Alright, fine.

08:23.094 --> 08:25.119
Great. What's your name, again?

08:25.370 --> 08:26.954
- Crystal.
- Crystal.

08:26.978 --> 08:28.404
- You ready?
- I'm ready.

08:28.844 --> 08:31.443
Crystal, do you feel your government
abandoned you?

08:32.010 --> 08:35.440
What I think is if all these
people were not infected,

08:35.466 --> 08:36.606
we would all be on the
bus right now.

08:37.049 --> 08:40.193
But this is what happens.
They mess up, and we get screwed.

08:40.549 --> 08:43.241
And then guys like you
come down here with your cameras...

08:43.246 --> 08:45.600
... and film it make money selling
commercials. It's awesome.

08:46.721 --> 08:49.880
Don't you think that the American people
deserve to know the truth?

08:49.921 --> 08:52.107
The American people
don't give a shit.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.402
Right.

08:54.460 --> 08:57.348
You don't seem too
concerned about zombies, themselves.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.069
You serious?

09:02.248 --> 09:03.609
They terrify me.

09:05.288 --> 09:07.346
Only an idiot wants to see a zombie.

09:13.453 --> 09:14.989
That went really, really well.

09:14.992 --> 09:16.463
I'll totally will send.

09:16.487 --> 09:19.519
Laugh it up, but we are
the only ones with the balls...

09:19.699 --> 09:21.263
... to cover this
thing from the inside.

09:21.287 --> 09:23.094
So, what does that make you,
the next Frank West?

09:23.406 --> 09:24.235
Why not?

09:24.947 --> 09:26.467
Because he almost died.

09:26.488 --> 09:28.826
You're gonna risk your life for this story?

09:28.850 --> 09:29.927
- No.
- No.

09:29.951 --> 09:31.348
But I'm willing to risk yours...

09:34.072 --> 09:35.310
I've got an idea.

09:35.544 --> 09:36.839
- Come on.
- God...

09:37.027 --> 09:38.027
Com'on.

09:43.192 --> 09:44.131
Follow me.

09:47.975 --> 09:49.817
Shit.
Chase, no.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.642
We are not going to get anything
from these people by embarrassing them.

09:52.814 --> 09:54.206
We want drama,

09:54.314 --> 09:55.995
we've got to get the needles.

09:56.062 --> 09:59.814
No, no. I didn't come here
to explore people.

09:59.838 --> 10:02.303
This is how we are going
to make a name for ourselves.

10:08.556 --> 10:09.669
You know what?

10:09.932 --> 10:10.991
Here.

10:13.429 --> 10:14.634
What's this?

10:15.429 --> 10:17.564
Remind yourself what real news looks like.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.136
What it use to look like.

10:22.386 --> 10:23.982
<i> Real News!</i>

10:28.182 --> 10:29.409

11:50.450 --> 11:51.410
I did.

11:56.585 --> 11:57.863
Back, back!

12:28.288 --> 12:30.202

13:54.834 --> 13:55.964
Wait!

13:56.288 --> 13:57.406

14:54.318 --> 14:56.501
<i> Frank West, famously survived...</i>

14:56.633 --> 14:58.726
<i> ... the first zombie outbreak
in US history.</i>

<i> He then rose to fame with his reporting...</i>

15:00.883 --> 15:04.459
<i> ...on the 2006 outbreak in
Willamette, Colorado.</i>

15:04.797 --> 15:07.909
<i> Frank, we don't know what's going on...</i>

15:07.933 --> 15:09.814
<i> ...inside East Mission yet.</i>

15:09.963 --> 15:11.756
<i> How bad will it get?</i>

15:11.880 --> 15:13.343
<i> Well...</i>

15:14.335 --> 15:16.736
<i> Bad, Sue.
Very bad.</i>

15:16.760 --> 15:18.373
<i> What do you mean by that?</i>

15:19.082 --> 15:20.333
<i> Uh... I don't know,</i>

15:20.357 --> 15:21.898
<i> people are going to get eaten,</i>

15:22.000 --> 15:23.882
<i> faces chewed off.</i>

<i> Screaming, as they go down.</i>

15:26.137 --> 15:28.548
<i> Their hands, arms,
guts ripped out.</i>

15:28.622 --> 15:30.761
<i> People are going to be
gnawing on each other.</i>

15:30.796 --> 15:32.900
<i> Eating flesh, that's what
zombies do.</i>

15:32.924 --> 15:34.773
<i> Am I the only one who knows
about zombies around here?</i>

15:35.138 --> 15:37.000
<i> - Yes,
- Zombies, they eat people...</i>

15:37.024 --> 15:38.449
<i> Usually they start on the extremities,</i>

15:38.473 --> 15:39.951
<i> usually with your fingers, hands...</i>

15:39.975 --> 15:41.082
<i> - Yes, Okay?

15:41.495 --> 15:43.557
<i> We'll be right back.</i>

15:58.673 --> 15:59.795

Hey!

16:54.158 --> 16:55.735
Hey!
Is this your van?

17:04.237 --> 17:05.303
Yes.

17:06.153 --> 17:07.124
Yes, it is.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.791
Okay, listen...

17:09.816 --> 17:11.656
We need to go, now.
Now!

17:15.442 --> 17:16.945
But my daughter.

17:19.522 --> 17:20.820
Jesus Christ.

17:22.397 --> 17:23.442
Did she bit you?

17:24.397 --> 17:25.702
She tried.

17:26.811 --> 17:28.680
- Come on,
- She tried.

17:33.394 --> 17:34.358
Com'on.

17:35.353 --> 17:36.314
No no no,

17:36.338 --> 17:37.884
We need to leave now,
We need to leave now.

17:37.908 --> 17:40.984
- Give me the keys!
- Come on!

17:41.008 --> 17:41.893
Let's go!

17:45.507 --> 17:47.520
Okay, let's go.

17:50.262 --> 17:52.497
Oh shit! Get the gate!
Get the gate!

17:52.888 --> 17:54.706
Go! Start! Go!

17:56.339 --> 17:57.239
Drive!

17:59.592 --> 18:00.784
Go!

18:35.124 --> 18:36.686
What the hell happened back there?

18:37.792 --> 18:39.328
The drug stopped working.

18:43.621 --> 18:44.817
Who are you calling?

18:44.954 --> 18:46.125
My ex-boss.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.308
I'm gonna break this story.

18:48.399 --> 18:51.529
So the zombie body count
is up to 2,500 now.

18:52.023 --> 18:54.632
There would be more if the golf club
hadn't broken.

18:56.979 --> 18:57.842
Hey.

18:58.687 --> 19:00.164
I've covered wars, you know.

19:00.810 --> 19:02.771
And saved a lot of people in Willamette.

19:02.933 --> 19:04.485
- Excuse me.
- Kids, mainly.

19:04.765 --> 19:08.290
Chase, I told you, St, Louis
was a one time thing.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.957
Screw St. Louis.

19:10.348 --> 19:11.598
I just left the Mega Dome,

19:11.890 --> 19:14.549
and it's funny, I didn't see any
UBN reporters around.

19:14.724 --> 19:16.126
You're inside?

19:16.138 --> 19:18.975
<i> - Yeah, I am.
- UBN exclusive?</i>

19:19.470 --> 19:20.519
No way.

19:20.543 --> 19:22.904
Look, I want your audience, but you've gonna
to link it back to Hit Point.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.616
I need graphics,
now.

19:26.384 --> 19:28.244
Stand by,
I want you live.

19:31.257 --> 19:33.954
Hey, was your daughter taking Zombrex?

19:33.978 --> 19:35.251
- Oh my God!
- Yes.

19:35.672 --> 19:37.892
I make sure she takes it every single day.

19:43.876 --> 19:46.800
<i> Chase, did they run out of Zombrex?</i>

19:46.916 --> 19:48.678
<i> No, there was plenty of Zombrex.</i>

19:48.789 --> 19:50.940
I saw them take it,
but they turned anyway.

19:51.665 --> 19:54.396
I'm telling you that
Zombrex didn't work.

19:55.748 --> 19:58.544
<i> Startling, live reporting from Chase Carter.</i>

19:58.573 --> 20:00.374
<i> Contributing reporter for...</i>

20:00.828 --> 20:02.278
<i> ... Hit Point Digital.</i>

20:10.360 --> 20:11.730
Do you know a way out?

20:11.826 --> 20:13.359
Casey has a map.

20:17.031 --> 20:18.178
Casey?

20:18.202 --> 20:19.612
Casey was your daughter?

20:20.322 --> 20:22.012
Do you think she's gonna be alright?

20:28.277 --> 20:30.052
- Hey, watch the road!
- Look out!

20:55.059 --> 20:57.690
Come on.

20:57.934 --> 20:59.647
- Come on!
- Idiots.

21:22.416 --> 21:25.980
- Hey, it's dead, it's dead.
- No! No!

21:26.939 --> 21:28.391
Wait! Wait!

21:54.831 --> 21:57.363
No! No!

22:01.484 --> 22:02.947
Hey, open the gate.

22:04.158 --> 22:05.350
Open the gate!

22:06.031 --> 22:07.894
Open the goddamn gate!

22:51.625 --> 22:53.660
Com'on, Jordan, pick up
the goddamn phone!

23:17.589 --> 23:20.265
You know, instead of just standing around,
you should be looking for weapons.

23:21.378 --> 23:23.586
A weapon?
What weapon?

23:23.619 --> 23:24.824
This place is full of junk.

23:28.376 --> 23:30.139
Do you need me to hold your
hand for everything?

23:30.243 --> 23:31.112
Make one.

23:57.329 --> 23:59.480
<i> - Use lethal force if necessary. 
- What?</i>

23:59.769 --> 24:01.265
<i> The virus could be airborne.</i>

24:01.302 --> 24:02.396
Airborne?

24:02.468 --> 24:04.606
<i> If anyone gets out,
it can kill millions.</i>

24:04.708 --> 24:05.690
Jesus.

24:12.157 --> 24:13.252
Are you crazy?

24:14.323 --> 24:16.980
You, go back.
You can't come out.

24:17.097 --> 24:18.647
What? No.

24:18.730 --> 24:19.961
Turn around now.

24:20.278 --> 24:21.403
No.

24:21.737 --> 24:22.818
Walk.

24:23.026 --> 24:24.220
- Now.
- Come on.

24:25.776 --> 24:28.344
Listen, I'm not going back out there.

24:32.150 --> 24:33.256
Help!

24:33.667 --> 24:36.050
- Help!
- Wait! Let us in!

24:38.063 --> 24:39.194
Shit.

24:40.606 --> 24:42.898
Close the gate!
Watch her.

24:51.845 --> 24:54.902
- No! No!
- Wait! Help us!

24:58.600 --> 25:00.540
- Let me in!
- Come on, let us out!

25:01.434 --> 25:03.015
<i> Come on, open the gate.</i>

25:03.050 --> 25:05.486
<i> - Please, let us in!
- Now!</i>

25:05.932 --> 25:08.546
Chase, where the hell were you?

25:08.565 --> 25:11.110
I was 15 feet from the goddamn car.
You left me.

25:11.134 --> 25:14.310
No, listen, they were all over me.
I couldn't see you.

25:14.431 --> 25:15.562
Where are you now?

25:15.848 --> 25:17.688
In some pawnshop downtown.

25:18.439 --> 25:20.442
- Are you out?
- Come on, let us in!

25:21.555 --> 25:22.868
- Please!
- Open the gate!

25:22.920 --> 25:24.110
Yes, I just got through.

25:26.677 --> 25:29.482
<i> - Help!
- Help!</i>

25:38.921 --> 25:40.948
Jo?
What's going on?

25:41.581 --> 25:42.586
I don't know.

25:44.303 --> 25:45.260
Turn back!

25:46.297 --> 25:47.347
Open up the gate.

25:48.130 --> 25:50.642
Get away from the wall, now,
I have orders to shoot.

25:51.045 --> 25:53.540
- Open up this goddamn thing now!
- Let us in!

25:53.876 --> 25:55.519
Come on! This is my family right here.

25:56.794 --> 25:59.260
Jesus, What are you doing?

25:59.302 --> 26:01.302
The virus is airborne,
they could kill us,

26:01.385 --> 26:03.602
This is your last chance,
get away from the wall.

26:04.874 --> 26:07.273
Open up, please. Open up the gate!

26:08.498 --> 26:10.028
Take her to quarantine.

26:11.855 --> 26:13.360
Wait! What does he mean?

26:16.162 --> 26:18.569
Com'on, please,
my family, save us.

26:20.245 --> 26:21.244
Dad!

26:31.366 --> 26:32.360
Wait!

26:38.615 --> 26:40.542
<i> Jo, you still there?</i>

26:42.822 --> 26:43.997
Chase,

26:46.611 --> 26:47.844
Chase...

26:51.152 --> 26:53.390
They shot people.

26:54.526 --> 26:56.012
They're shooting people.

26:57.569 --> 27:00.098
Listen, you gotta get me out.

27:07.607 --> 27:09.495
I don't...
I don't think I can.

27:16.644 --> 27:17.562
Wait.

27:18.278 --> 27:19.887
We should stay here tonight.

27:21.354 --> 27:22.882
There's no where to go, anyway.

27:23.218 --> 27:24.223
Why not?

27:25.102 --> 27:26.836
They're shooting people at the wall.

27:28.759 --> 27:29.948
We're trapped.

27:32.316 --> 27:35.430
<i> Authorities now suspect that
the East Mission virus is...</i>

27:35.513 --> 27:37.550
<i> ... resistance to Zombrex.</i>

27:37.554 --> 27:41.013
<i> Some media outlets are reporting
that may communicable ...</i>

27:41.037 --> 27:43.863
<i> ... through touch or some kind
of airborne contact.</i>

27:43.889 --> 27:47.313
<i> In response FEZA stopped all
evacuation efforts...</i>

27:47.337 --> 27:48.834
<i> ... and have sealed the city.</i>

27:48.858 --> 27:50.828
<i> For a view from inside,</i>

27:50.852 --> 27:53.500
<i> go again by
Hit Point's, Chase Carter.</i>

27:53.524 --> 27:54.499
<i> Chase,</i>

27:54.523 --> 27:56.812
<i> Those rumors are
completely false, Susan.</i>

27:56.847 --> 27:57.996
<i> I'm with a small group...</i>

27:58.020 --> 27:59.211
<i> ... right now, and we're all fine.</i>

27:59.344 --> 28:01.420
<i> If you can pass
the virus by touch...</i>

28:01.514 --> 28:03.652
<i> ... or by some airborne transmission,
we'd know it.</i>

28:03.761 --> 28:05.987
<i> Are you sure you're not infected?</i>

28:06.760 --> 28:10.151
I have no symptoms, the people
I'm with have no symptoms, we're fine.

28:10.177 --> 28:13.080
<i>Do you feel the  government
has abandoned you?</i>

28:14.014 --> 28:15.397
You're damn right I do.

28:15.513 --> 28:17.175
What right do they have
to keep us here?

28:17.592 --> 28:20.601
<i> Frank, does the Government have
the right...</i>

28:20.625 --> 28:21.961
<i> ... quarantine our corespondent?</i>

28:22.053 --> 28:24.897
<i> It's a zombie apocalypse,
And you're talking about right?</i>

28:24.921 --> 28:26.662
<i> Jesus Christ!</i>

28:26.760 --> 28:29.019
<i> Chase, Where I'm I look...? Chase.</i>

28:29.043 --> 28:30.828
<i> Hey, listen,</i>

28:30.852 --> 28:32.931
<i>you just keep reporting, OK?</i>

28:33.136 --> 28:34.781
<i> You're doing a good
job in there, my man.</i>

28:35.178 --> 28:36.747
<i> Alright, Frank, let's get back...</i>

28:36.868 --> 28:38.998
<i> ... to the topic at hand.</i>

28:39.022 --> 28:40.830
<i> I'm sure that the government is...</i>

28:40.854 --> 28:43.077
<i> ... working hard on a fix.</i>

28:43.100 --> 28:45.540
<i> The government is working hard
on not shitting it's pants.</i>

28:45.632 --> 28:47.697
<i>If this is a resistant strain...</i>

28:47.721 --> 28:49.242
<i> ... they're going to burn everyone.</i>

28:49.266 --> 28:51.817
<i> OK, we don't know that
they are going to burn anyone.</i>

28:51.841 --> 28:53.969
<i> - No...
- We don't want to cause panic out there  ,</i>

28:53.993 --> 28:55.250
<i> What are you talking about?</i>

28:55.274 --> 28:57.906
<i> If you're on the inside of this one, ah, shit,</i>

28:57.930 --> 29:00.010
<i>You are really fucked.</i>

29:00.034 --> 29:01.457
<i> OK. Fantastic.</i>

29:04.005 --> 29:05.871
Celebrity isn't going to
get you out of here.

29:08.090 --> 29:09.697
Making people care might.

29:16.715 --> 29:17.908
Drink.

29:18.466 --> 29:19.699
Thanks.

29:22.505 --> 29:23.729
Hey, Maggie.

29:24.920 --> 29:26.552
Look,  know it might be hard.

29:26.920 --> 29:28.480
But can I interview you?

29:30.586 --> 29:31.838
I don't know...

29:32.503 --> 29:34.228
I don't think that I have anything to say.

29:38.254 --> 29:40.874
Well you know,
sharing your story...

29:42.003 --> 29:44.317
... it might help you with
what happened to your daughter.

29:50.418 --> 29:51.650
OK.

29:52.292 --> 29:53.505
Great.

29:55.418 --> 29:56.644
OK.

29:58.337 --> 29:59.511
Go ahead.

30:01.951 --> 30:03.399
Casey, she...

30:04.709 --> 30:06.599
You have to understand that her dad...

30:06.623 --> 30:08.063
... left us right after she was bitten.

30:08.457 --> 30:09.589
He...

30:10.165 --> 30:12.374
...blamed me, I guess.

30:13.543 --> 30:16.311
I was in the kitchen when it happened.

30:17.041 --> 30:18.687
I got two of them.

30:20.293 --> 30:21.867
But the third one...

30:23.583 --> 30:25.351
... got to her crib.

30:26.998 --> 30:30.531
It didn't do much damage.
You can barely see the scar,

30:30.873 --> 30:32.249
I just...

30:34.415 --> 30:38.121
I don't get to her in time.

30:40.164 --> 30:43.058
So, it's just her and me now.

30:44.705 --> 30:46.707
And she's not lust my daughter,

30:46.743 --> 30:48.367
she is my best friend,

30:49.404 --> 30:52.676
And we struggled...
Well we still struggle.

30:54.285 --> 30:55.940
But we get by.

30:57.235 --> 31:01.511
And it makes us stronger.

31:01.535 --> 31:03.540
You know, closer.

31:05.027 --> 31:07.543
Even when she isn't in
the same room as me...

31:08.994 --> 31:12.590
She is all I can think of.

31:14.696 --> 31:16.891
I can't wait for you to met her.

31:19.535 --> 31:22.239
She is such a wonderful little child.

31:24.757 --> 31:28.080
I'm going to feel much better
when I get to her.

31:38.067 --> 31:39.290
You should eat.

31:41.564 --> 31:43.018
You've got to keep up your strength.

32:16.440 --> 32:19.098
Turn around, and put
your hands on your head.

32:19.647 --> 32:21.674
- Okay, just calm down,
- Do it now!

32:21.698 --> 32:23.010
I'm not infected!

32:23.034 --> 32:24.865
Turn around, and put
your hands on your head.

32:24.896 --> 32:26.139
- OK!
- Now!

32:26.603 --> 32:27.780
Stop.

32:28.145 --> 32:29.637
Just relax.

32:29.969 --> 32:32.282
I would like to save at
least one person today.

32:32.306 --> 32:34.442
Hey, you know how to use one of these?

32:35.101 --> 32:36.151
Yeah.

32:39.550 --> 32:41.219
You want to tell me what's going on?

32:42.894 --> 32:44.814
We think it is a resistant strain.

32:45.392 --> 32:48.341
The evacuation is closed
until we know for sure.

32:48.640 --> 32:51.034
You were the last person
through the gate

32:57.389 --> 32:58.999
And if it is positive?

33:02.260 --> 33:03.995
Let's hope that's not the case.

35:43.528 --> 35:45.266
- Hey.
- Jordan...

35:45.290 --> 35:48.498
...I'm with a girl,
and she is infected.

35:49.235 --> 35:51.736
Well, I'm sitting in a
plastic room...

35:51.760 --> 35:54.711
... waiting for them to decide if
they are going to shoot me or not.

35:55.275 --> 35:57.700
Is she showing symptoms?

35:57.735 --> 35:59.758
I saw her shooting up Zombrex.

36:02.525 --> 36:03.761
And it worked.

36:05.441 --> 36:07.787
That proves that
it isn't a resistant strain.

36:08.939 --> 36:10.805
So, her drug is different?

36:10.938 --> 36:12.091
She's different?

36:12.645 --> 36:15.737
Either way, that girl is evidence.

36:15.761 --> 36:17.042
It's a huge story.

36:17.066 --> 36:19.179
A story that could kill me in my sleep.

36:19.203 --> 36:21.691
Oh come Chase!
She is still human.

36:22.353 --> 36:23.977
She's probably terrified.

36:24.847 --> 36:27.451
And given the panic here, she
is your best shot...

36:27.475 --> 36:30.763
... To convince FEZA to left her out.
Then, you need to stay with her.

36:31.850 --> 36:33.899
All I have to do is get her on camera.

36:34.519 --> 36:36.776
If I can get something,
can you get me out?

36:38.717 --> 36:39.806
Yeah.

36:39.808 --> 36:41.737
Yeah, I'll do everything I can.

36:42.765 --> 36:43.963
And Chase...

36:44.850 --> 36:48.601
... just make sure you know how
exactly how much she has left, okay?

36:49.908 --> 36:51.135
Yeah.

37:15.014 --> 37:16.160
Hey?

37:16.759 --> 37:19.063
Hi.
Here.

37:26.268 --> 37:27.413
Thank you.

37:29.185 --> 37:31.113
My daughter has one just like it.

37:35.290 --> 37:36.387
Yeah.

37:37.641 --> 37:39.070
Yeah, I know.

37:39.765 --> 37:41.352
Don't worry, I'm going.

37:41.376 --> 37:42.556
It's OK.

37:43.639 --> 37:45.120
I know how it feels.

37:46.178 --> 37:48.245
Casey and I have to
deal with it every day.

37:49.887 --> 37:51.110
But you're not alone.

37:52.261 --> 37:54.934
I always tell Casey that
in situations like these...

37:55.054 --> 37:57.518
...that you have to
hold on to your friends.

37:59.387 --> 38:00.908
They're not easy to find.

38:06.134 --> 38:07.299
Well...

38:08.507 --> 38:09.705
Thank you, but...

38:11.923 --> 38:12.944
...I've got to go.

38:13.881 --> 38:15.393
I'm almost out of time.

38:39.252 --> 38:40.454
You're clear.

38:42.709 --> 38:46.089
And I'm guessing that it's your truck,
messing up my camp.

38:52.705 --> 38:53.815
Hey!

38:55.288 --> 38:57.030
It's not a resistant strain.

38:57.494 --> 38:59.495
Yeah, where did you go to medical school?

38:59.530 --> 39:00.873
My partner is in there.

39:00.897 --> 39:03.522
One of the people he's with has her
own Zombrex and she is fine.

39:03.661 --> 39:04.766
How do I know that?

39:04.993 --> 39:06.944
Send a copter,
bring them out and test her.

39:06.968 --> 39:08.751
Meanwhile...
I have a whole quarantine to run.

39:08.775 --> 39:10.608
Researchers across the country
are working on that.

39:10.951 --> 39:12.900
Meanwhile you are shooting people.

39:12.924 --> 39:15.055
- Healthy people.
- You think I like that?

39:15.079 --> 39:16.172
You think I want that?

39:16.283 --> 39:18.769
I am responsible for the
safety of the entire country.

39:20.866 --> 39:22.393
I can't take a chance,

39:22.417 --> 39:24.064
... on them,
on your friend.

39:26.997 --> 39:28.301
You want to give me proof?

39:28.325 --> 39:29.533
You better make it quick.

39:55.191 --> 39:56.512
Go, go, go!

39:56.567 --> 39:58.319
<i> - Yes, sir,
- On the left side  ,</i>

39:59.067 --> 40:00.337
<i> - On me.
- Yes sir, </i>

40:13.825 --> 40:16.698
<i> New developments in the
Mission East quarantine...</i>

40:16.724 --> 40:19.253
<i> The US military arrived,</i>

40:19.277 --> 40:21.783
<i> and we go now live
to a press conference.</i>

40:21.807 --> 40:23.102
<i> already in progress,</i>

40:23.400 --> 40:27.732
Citizens, we are here to
support FEZA in any way we can.

40:28.651 --> 40:30.438
This is a serious situation,

40:31.313 --> 40:32.706
but there is no need to panic,

40:33.021 --> 40:34.337
It is true,

40:35.146 --> 40:36.716
tough choices have to be made.

40:37.479 --> 40:38.450
and they will be taken,

40:39.144 --> 40:41.320
and they will be made decisively.

40:42.269 --> 40:44.102
I have been authorized
by the White House...

40:44.520 --> 40:47.175
... to destroy the threat,
through military action.

40:48.266 --> 40:51.762
This country is and will remain safe,

40:52.599 --> 40:54.494
I expect fire bombing to commence...

40:55.224 --> 40:56.382
... within 48 hours,

40:57.597 --> 40:58.630
Thank you for your time.

41:09.932 --> 41:13.332
<i> Frank, what advice do you have...</i>

41:13.425 --> 41:16.597
<i> ... for those trapped in
inside the quarantine zone?</i>

41:17.140 --> 41:18.598
<i> Turn off your television.</i>

41:18.806 --> 41:21.489
<i> Put down your phones and
run for your goddamn life.</i>

41:22.473 --> 41:24.015
<i> Run where?</i>

41:24.348 --> 41:26.855
<i> The quarantine is sealed,
there is nowhere to go.</i>

41:26.957 --> 41:28.183
<i> What the hell are you talking about?</i>

41:28.514 --> 41:29.855
<i> Fine, Let me tell you something.</i>

41:29.971 --> 41:32.272
<i> - Read my book.
- Oh, Jesus  ,</i>

41:32.345 --> 41:34.576
<i> Chapter 5,
I specifically tell you that...</i>

41:34.680 --> 41:36.768
<i> ... can't worry about technicalities.</i>

41:36.972 --> 41:38.805
<i> Okay? Screw the rules.</i>

41:38.848 --> 41:40.952
<i> You have to improvise,
think on your feet...</i>

41:41.179 --> 41:42.112
<i> ... use what you can,</i>

41:42.264 --> 41:44.014
<i>where you can.</i>

41:44.222 --> 41:46.531
<i> Maybe you shoot you down
like a dog, maybe not,</i>

41:46.552 --> 41:47.799
<i> But I'll tell you one thing...</i>

41:48.136 --> 41:49.929
<i> Talking to us,
ain't going to help you at all.</i>

42:14.716 --> 42:15.801
Sorry.

42:16.757 --> 42:17.920
I didn't realize.

42:18.717 --> 42:19.971
You don't owe me anything.

42:22.967 --> 42:24.917
How are you feeling?

42:27.217 --> 42:28.355
Hey?

42:28.549 --> 42:30.364
Why do your drugs work and theirs didn't?

42:39.965 --> 42:41.933
I have a dealer.

42:43.839 --> 42:45.717
I hate those goddamn clinics.

42:47.169 --> 42:48.278
You have any left?

42:53.005 --> 42:53.993
Just one.

42:55.254 --> 42:56.687
Do you know where to get more?

43:10.501 --> 43:11.902
Oh thank God!

43:15.625 --> 43:17.018
I thought you left me here.

43:18.500 --> 43:22.108
Look, We need to stick together and
come up with some kind of plan.

43:22.128 --> 43:23.964
Yeah, well, I don't have time, so...

43:24.127 --> 43:25.798
... I have to find some Zombrex...

43:26.247 --> 43:27.238
... out there.

43:28.958 --> 43:30.096
<i> is true.</i>

43:30.708 --> 43:32.595
<i> Tough choices must be made.</i>

43:33.288 --> 43:34.352
<i> Will be made.</i>

43:34.957 --> 43:37.211
<i> And they will be made decisively.</i>

43:37.539 --> 43:39.505
<i> I have been authorized
by the White House...</i>

43:39.790 --> 43:42.504
<i> ... to destroy the threat,
through military action.</i>

43:42.624 --> 43:45.758
<i> I expect firebombing
to commence within 48 hours.</i>

44:20.324 --> 44:21.235
Come on.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.888
We've got five minutes, boys!

44:34.908 --> 44:36.468
Get what you can!

44:36.574 --> 44:37.983
Let's go shopping.

44:38.282 --> 44:39.563
Yeah!

44:39.825 --> 44:41.140
Take everything!

45:45.359 --> 45:46.514
Yeah.

46:10.187 --> 46:11.580
You're gonna get us killed.

46:47.392 --> 46:49.762
You're a bad girl, huh?

46:50.641 --> 46:52.178
Look at you.

46:53.595 --> 46:56.705
Yeah. Okay, okay...

46:56.729 --> 47:00.175
- You've got me.
- Leave the sword.

47:05.173 --> 47:06.271
Logan!

47:07.014 --> 47:08.358
Logan!

47:09.391 --> 47:10.379
Now.

47:26.200 --> 47:27.133
Move.

47:41.198 --> 47:42.302
Yeah.

47:57.277 --> 47:58.443
I found my sword.

48:11.443 --> 48:12.660
Maybe they can help us.

48:12.857 --> 48:15.131
- I don`t believe...
- You can trust me, I've got this.

48:15.355 --> 48:16.580
- Honey, wait!
- Hey...

48:16.938 --> 48:18.032
Hey, hold up!

48:18.648 --> 48:20.334
Hey, guys.

48:20.811 --> 48:23.133
Oh, Jesus.
Thank God.

48:23.395 --> 48:24.942
We can go with you guys?
Please man, just...

48:25.312 --> 48:26.715
We need help, man.

48:28.102 --> 48:29.211
It's OK, yeah, yeah.

48:31.688 --> 48:33.244
Ten grand, one way.

48:34.310 --> 48:35.090
What?

48:35.975 --> 48:37.394
I don't have $10,000.

48:46.058 --> 48:48.997
You should have just offered me the girl.

48:51.515 --> 48:53.174
Now I get her for free.

48:54.471 --> 48:56.030
- Fuck,
- Run!

48:57.177 --> 48:59.437
Run! Run!

49:10.384 --> 49:12.041
Oh shit.

49:26.757 --> 49:27.925
Get off me!

49:28.170 --> 49:30.370
Yeah!

49:34.840 --> 49:37.588
No! No! Come back!

49:37.834 --> 49:40.531
Stop! Get off of me!

49:45.504 --> 49:47.301
- You want a ride?
- Yes!

49:47.628 --> 49:49.365
Help! Please help me!

49:49.417 --> 49:50.435
You should have ran.

49:51.209 --> 49:52.088
No!

49:52.874 --> 49:55.205
No!

49:55.750 --> 49:58.612
No! Help me!

49:59.204 --> 50:01.300
Please don't leave me!

50:12.995 --> 50:15.370
<i> Frank, our producers
would like to know...</i>

50:15.445 --> 50:17.568
<i> ...If you can give
our viewers...</i>

50:17.880 --> 50:20.136
<i> ... especially, our
younger viewers...</i>

50:20.251 --> 50:21.790
<i> Yeah, word up.</i>

50:21.852 --> 50:25.038
<i> Some tips on
how to deal with zombies,</i>

50:25.334 --> 50:26.771
<i> - Of course,
- Before you answer,</i>

50:26.818 --> 50:28.224
<i> let's go back to Willamette.</i>

50:28.337 --> 50:29.565
<i> What you saw,</i>

50:29.875 --> 50:31.225
<i> what you felt,</i>

50:31.315 --> 50:32.916
<i> what did you do...</i>

50:33.089 --> 50:36.600
<i> ... when you were confronted
for many zombies at once?</i>

50:38.239 --> 50:40.799
<i>Well the first thing you want to do is
take out as many as possible,</i>

50:40.855 --> 50:41.961
<i> Early.</i>

50:42.106 --> 50:43.902
<i> So go for the weak ones first.</i>

50:44.356 --> 50:45.476
<i> Grandma...</i>

50:46.438 --> 50:48.175
<i> ... take her out, grandpa too.</i>

50:48.189 --> 50:49.531
<i> You've got siblings?</i>

50:49.871 --> 50:51.139
<i> They're going to be easier.</i>

50:51.271 --> 50:52.990
<i> Save your parents for the last.</i>

50:55.231 --> 50:56.718
<i> Remember to breathe,</i>

50:58.063 --> 50:59.558
<i> Take short breaks...</i>

50:59.936 --> 51:01.710
<i> ... to recover your stamina.</i>

51:02.935 --> 51:05.014
<i> And then when you get down to the last one...</i>

51:05.227 --> 51:06.496
<i> ... or two...</i>

51:07.598 --> 51:09.288
<i> ... probably your mom or dad...</i>

51:11.222 --> 51:12.662
<i> You should be OK.</i>

51:15.143 --> 51:17.050
<i> Just make sure you finish the job.</i>

51:19.770 --> 51:20.970
<i> Frank, that's...</i>

51:21.099 --> 51:23.189
<i> Wow, thank you. That was great.</i>

51:23.723 --> 51:25.427
<i> Hey, and one more thing, kids.</i>

51:26.473 --> 51:28.022
<i> Remember to build weapons.</i>

51:28.222 --> 51:29.442
<i>Lots of weapons.</i>

51:32.506 --> 51:34.091
Maggie, would you get some tape?

51:37.715 --> 51:39.100
Help me.

51:47.252 --> 51:48.351
You coming?

51:50.336 --> 51:51.338
Listen.

51:51.462 --> 51:54.204
The only reason they are bombing
is they don't know you exist.

51:54.499 --> 51:56.022
They didn't know your drugs is working.

51:58.170 --> 52:00.139
We don't need to go out there.

52:01.001 --> 52:02.535
We just need to get you on camera.

52:05.916 --> 52:07.092
Not happening.

52:25.285 --> 52:26.850
Your daughter isn't out there.

52:35.285 --> 52:36.578
Good luck.

52:40.117 --> 52:41.182
Damn!

52:51.690 --> 52:53.644
Jordan,I have an idea.

52:54.033 --> 52:55.626
Now, listen to me.

52:56.075 --> 52:57.794
I need you to find some Zombrex.

52:59.778 --> 53:01.007
Great.

53:15.736 --> 53:16.946
Shit.

53:23.657 --> 53:24.867
Goddammit!

53:29.182 --> 53:31.598
Okay, we have to
do it quietly.

53:31.939 --> 53:32.983
It's okay,

53:41.721 --> 53:42.789
Hey!

53:44.499 --> 53:47.797
You ready to die,
you brain dead zombies fucks?

53:47.821 --> 53:49.124
Come and get it!

54:35.643 --> 54:37.726
Chase! That's enough.
Follow us.

54:48.377 --> 54:49.716
Motherfucker!

54:58.553 --> 54:59.546
Com'on.

58:36.571 --> 58:37.743
Thanks.

58:38.970 --> 58:39.973
Get in.

59:01.756 --> 59:04.479
<i> Hey, right now,
real quick, pop quiz.</i>

59:04.623 --> 59:05.897
<i> How would you kill me
if you could?</i>

59:06.105 --> 59:07.239
<i> Oh my God!</i>

59:07.382 --> 59:09.363
<i> Right now, with my bare hands.</i>

59:11.128 --> 59:12.973
<i> You would lose against a zombie.</i>

59:12.997 --> 59:15.536
<i> BAd advice, don't try it with
bare hands, grab a weapon.</i>

59:15.835 --> 59:17.366
<i>Can I tell you how I would kill you?</i>

59:17.672 --> 59:19.622
<i> - I wouldn't
- You're killing me right now.  ,</i>

59:19.646 --> 59:21.221
<i> Wouldn't, I wouldn't kill you.</i>

59:22.253 --> 59:24.045
<i> If you were a zombie, I'd let you eat me.</i>

59:24.253 --> 59:25.373
<i> Oh God!</i>

59:26.413 --> 59:28.798
<i> - This seems like a great place to...
- I'm kidding!</i>

59:28.822 --> 59:30.447
<i> I'm kidding. I would smash your
head in with a television.</i>

59:31.249 --> 59:33.149
<i> I would smash your head in with that television right there.</i>

59:33.335 --> 59:35.604
<i> I may be begging you to do that shortly.</i>

59:40.001 --> 59:42.554
Do you still have Zombrex
stored inside the city?

59:42.578 --> 59:44.698
- I'm very busy.
- Do you have supplies in there or not?

59:44.722 --> 59:46.243
Why? So you can blame this on us?

59:46.456 --> 59:48.321
So I can save lives.

59:50.871 --> 59:52.124
How are you going to do that?

59:53.083 --> 59:55.598
I need to get some Zombrex
to a guy inside.

59:55.622 --> 59:57.453
I can prove that it's
not a resistant strain.

01:00:00.912 --> 01:00:02.451
Counts and estimates.

01:00:03.577 --> 01:00:04.703
We show have a look,

01:00:06.539 --> 01:00:09.591
- But General, she's not...
- Don't worry.

01:00:10.542 --> 01:00:11.764
I was here.

01:00:14.735 --> 01:00:16.114
- Listen...
- No!

01:00:18.405 --> 01:00:20.694
Norton, you've got to help me out.

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:23.897
Excuse me.

01:00:34.967 --> 01:00:36.134
Jesus.

01:01:22.943 --> 01:01:24.392
Thank you, Norton.

01:01:46.888 --> 01:01:48.019
Got it.

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.968
Hey, I think I can get them to let us out.

01:01:52.405 --> 01:01:53.534
Hey, did you hear me?

01:02:17.149 --> 01:02:18.206
Okay.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:27.733
They've all been looted.

01:02:28.008 --> 01:02:29.620
Jordan found something.

01:02:29.644 --> 01:02:31.887
A storage facility. There should be Zombrex there.

01:02:33.925 --> 01:02:35.152
Come on, let's go.

01:03:04.879 --> 01:03:06.240
Who the hell did this?

01:03:06.445 --> 01:03:07.576
I don't know.

01:03:08.878 --> 01:03:10.498
Think they're still home?

01:03:26.149 --> 01:03:27.341
Thanks.

01:03:46.188 --> 01:03:47.852
Jesus Christ.

01:03:48.832 --> 01:03:50.815
How are we supposed to find
anything in here?

01:03:51.472 --> 01:03:52.598
Come on.

01:03:56.076 --> 01:03:58.003
<i> You be my friend?</i>

01:04:15.119 --> 01:04:17.188
<i> You be my friend?</i>

01:04:22.019 --> 01:04:24.723
<i> You want to be my friend...
My friend?</i>

01:04:24.899 --> 01:04:26.144
<i> My friend?</i>

01:04:28.249 --> 01:04:30.402
<i> Let's play a game.</i>

01:04:43.522 --> 01:04:44.971
Hey where's Maggie?

01:04:51.525 --> 01:04:52.694
Okay, let's go,

01:04:56.855 --> 01:04:58.071
Is anyone living here?

01:05:23.343 --> 01:05:24.504
Son of a bitch.

01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.446
It's the same shit
from the stadium.

01:05:45.836 --> 01:05:47.690
We still have to prove
the problem is with the drugs.

01:05:48.335 --> 01:05:49.750
and not a new strain
of the virus.

01:05:50.542 --> 01:05:51.623
Really, how?

01:05:53.503 --> 01:05:54.743
You take a dose.

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:58.307
If symptoms come on, we know
it doesn't work.

01:05:58.331 --> 01:05:59.799
and then you can take
good stuff right away.

01:06:00.821 --> 01:06:01.931
Are you kidding?

01:06:01.955 --> 01:06:03.551
If we can prove the drugs is bad,

01:06:03.662 --> 01:06:05.683
and go public,
they will have to let us out.

01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:08.733
Yeah, go public.

01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:10.814
Look, we can search every
drug store in town.

01:06:11.413 --> 01:06:13.186
We still get firebombed tomorrow.

01:06:15.034 --> 01:06:16.262
It's the only way.

01:07:08.016 --> 01:07:09.152
Take your camera.

01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.749
<i> My friend... My friend.</i>

01:07:19.555 --> 01:07:21.451
<i> Let's play a game.</i>

01:07:21.679 --> 01:07:25.225
<i> Game... Game... Game,
my friend.</i>

01:07:27.178 --> 01:07:29.813
<i> Will you be my friend...
My friend?</i>

01:07:38.428 --> 01:07:40.444
<i> Will you be my friend?</i>

01:07:41.219 --> 01:07:42.543
<i> Be My Friend?</i>

01:07:50.046 --> 01:07:51.862
<i> Will you be my friend?</i>

01:07:51.886 --> 01:07:52.644
<i> Be My Friend?</i>

01:08:00.708 --> 01:08:02.812
<i> Be my friend...
Be My Friend?</i>

01:08:13.328 --> 01:08:15.017
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.090
Mommy's here.

01:08:22.825 --> 01:08:25.149
Oh baby, I'm sorry.

01:08:29.657 --> 01:08:32.117
<i> I love you.</i>

01:08:35.778 --> 01:08:37.665
<i> You're my friend.</i>

01:09:00.064 --> 01:09:03.247
This is Chase Carter,
recording Crystal LaRourke.

01:09:05.325 --> 01:09:06.491
Crystal,

01:09:06.515 --> 01:09:08.300
can you bring the vial to the camera?

01:09:10.185 --> 01:09:13.063
This is the same batch that
they were using tn the Mega Dome yesterday.

01:09:19.207 --> 01:09:20.673
As you can see...

01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:23.888
... it has no effect.

01:09:26.087 --> 01:09:28.178
Now this is her personal supply.

01:09:28.202 --> 01:09:29.524
not government issue.

01:09:34.595 --> 01:09:35.658
Go ahead, Crystal.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:41.787
Crystal!

01:09:43.008 --> 01:09:44.252
Help me.

01:09:44.277 --> 01:09:45.121
Shit.

01:10:04.218 --> 01:10:05.319
You alright?

01:10:07.551 --> 01:10:08.559
Yeah.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:18.800
Oh shit!

01:10:19.712 --> 01:10:20.720
What?

01:10:48.695 --> 01:10:49.816
We're trapped.

01:11:02.399 --> 01:11:03.364
<i> Frank...</i>

01:11:04.359 --> 01:11:07.774
<i> We are here to talk about your
experience at Willamette...</i>

01:11:07.798 --> 01:11:11.302
<i> and to hopefully offer people some kind of advice,</i>

01:11:11.326 --> 01:11:13.766
<i> - or hope...
- How much hope do they have?</i>

01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:14.926
<i> You're basically, are fucked.</i>

01:11:15.526 --> 01:11:17.664
<i> I'm sorry, but you are...</i>

01:11:17.688 --> 01:11:19.003
<i> That's great.</i>

01:11:19.027 --> 01:11:21.536
<i> Your book must have been one page.</i>

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:24.153
<i> "You're basically fucked" is
all it said.</i>

01:11:24.177 --> 01:11:26.118
<i> No, it's a lot of pages.</i>

01:11:26.142 --> 01:11:28.326
<i> You must be  "fucked" a hundred times?</i>

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:31.106
<i> -It's...
- Okay, so that's it  ,</i>

01:11:31.146 --> 01:11:33.450
<i> Let's take a break...</i>

01:11:33.474 --> 01:11:36.871
<i> ... this informative chat with Frank West.</i>

01:11:36.943 --> 01:11:39.903
<i> has a lot more pages, it doesn't
say that. It has tons of words.</i>

01:11:49.414 --> 01:11:50.890
You think Maggies OK?

01:12:04.306 --> 01:12:05.395
There you go.

01:12:09.077 --> 01:12:10.394
Give me your phone.

01:12:11.906 --> 01:12:12.788
Why?

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.296
Hey wait, don't have to do that.

01:12:28.039 --> 01:12:29.605
You know, after Fortune City,

01:12:30.577 --> 01:12:33.190
everyone was so happy
me that I had survived, you know?

01:12:35.676 --> 01:12:36.720
But...

01:12:38.803 --> 01:12:40.523
... that all change really quickly.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.606
My friends started avoiding me,

01:12:44.133 --> 01:12:46.879
my coworkers,

01:12:50.382 --> 01:12:51.649
I was clerking at
a law firm,

01:12:51.697 --> 01:12:55.060
and I spent my
last week in the basement.

01:12:57.049 --> 01:12:58.393
My fiance,

01:12:59.088 --> 01:13:01.952
he stuck around for 33 days.

01:13:04.963 --> 01:13:06.458
That was when I started hiding.

01:13:09.711 --> 01:13:10.955
I feel like that's...

01:13:12.088 --> 01:13:14.119
all I've done in
the last five years.

01:13:18.378 --> 01:13:21.623
Stay alive,
but not really living.

01:13:24.084 --> 01:13:27.735
There is no point to hiding it now,
so maybe it will help someone.

01:13:36.119 --> 01:13:37.077
Who's...

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:39.234
Chris Krabowski?

01:13:42.958 --> 01:13:44.725
I changed my name.

01:13:50.830 --> 01:13:51.712
Yeah, I...

01:13:52.164 --> 01:13:55.289
figured if I wanted to get famous,
I needed to change my name.

01:13:55.702 --> 01:13:58.126
Not many stars out
there named Krabowski.

01:13:58.203 --> 01:13:59.356
Oh my God!

01:14:02.119 --> 01:14:03.033
Well...

01:14:03.911 --> 01:14:06.782
Since you fought off a horde
of zombies single handily,

01:14:08.368 --> 01:14:10.022
you'll gonna be bigger than Frank West.

01:14:11.787 --> 01:14:12.927
Yeah.

01:14:20.156 --> 01:14:23.081
<i> This is Chase Carter,
recording Crystal LaRourke.</i>

01:14:27.326 --> 01:14:31.304
<i> The dramatic video by UBN correspondent, Chase Carter...</i>

01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:35.191
<i> ... raises serious questions about
government management of this disaster.</i>

01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.524
<i> Oh my God!</i>

01:14:51.651 --> 01:14:53.485
That video is amazing.

01:14:53.691 --> 01:14:55.277
We have 3 million hits already...

01:14:55.301 --> 01:14:57.287
UBN is running it like every 3 minutes.

01:14:57.357 --> 01:14:58.813
<i> Are they letting people out?</i>

01:14:58.814 --> 01:15:01.172
I'm going to talk to FEZA about it,
right now.

01:15:01.734 --> 01:15:03.139
Doesn't matter.

01:15:03.358 --> 01:15:05.863
At least I don't think it's going to matter.

01:15:06.417 --> 01:15:09.508
What? No, listen,
listen, Just hang in there.

01:15:09.532 --> 01:15:10.703
We're trapped.

01:15:11.608 --> 01:15:13.326
I don't know how much time we have left.

01:15:14.608 --> 01:15:16.553
Don't you give up on me, Chase.

01:15:18.231 --> 01:15:19.831
Listen, no matter what happens.

01:15:21.106 --> 01:15:22.669
Don't beat yourself up, OK?

01:15:24.522 --> 01:15:26.054
<i> You're a good friend, Jordan.</i>

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:28.845
You bastard, don't
even think about it.

01:15:32.488 --> 01:15:33.545
Chase?

01:15:34.644 --> 01:15:36.044
Goodbye, Jo.

01:15:52.425 --> 01:15:53.699
You want to call someone?

01:16:10.210 --> 01:16:11.565
Come on, let's go, boys.

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:37.083
Who left open the goddamn
zombie room open?

01:16:49.796 --> 01:16:51.297
Any last words?

01:16:52.463 --> 01:16:54.622
You've got to be kidding me.

01:16:54.996 --> 01:16:56.515
The drugs don't work.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:17:00.143
I mean, I could chain you up there with Larry.

01:17:01.626 --> 01:17:04.226
- Son of...
- Yeah, I know.

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.157
Would you can clean up this mess?

01:17:17.094 --> 01:17:19.075
I'm sorry, sir, but
I can't confirm that.

01:17:19.082 --> 01:17:20.670
Get the hell out of my tent.

01:17:21.522 --> 01:17:23.409
My guy is
trapped in your warehouse.

01:17:23.433 --> 01:17:24.361
He needs help right away,

01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:28.032
Yeah Yeah, screw your guy and his help.

01:17:28.103 --> 01:17:29.975
I'm buried under 10 tons of shit...

01:17:30.029 --> 01:17:31.423
... you guys stirred up with that video.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:33.526
They're going kill him,

01:17:33.563 --> 01:17:35.817
Yes, and not just him.

01:17:36.310 --> 01:17:37.957
Get the hell out. Go.

01:17:38.769 --> 01:17:40.563
If he dies, I'm coming for you.

01:17:58.544 --> 01:17:59.285
Hey!

01:17:59.309 --> 01:18:00.195
Don't worry, I'm from the press.

01:18:00.219 --> 01:18:00.959
Hey!

01:18:02.836 --> 01:18:05.583
<i> - Crystal?
- I don't think we should...</i>

01:18:13.091 --> 01:18:15.303
This proves that it is safe
to let people out.

01:18:17.838 --> 01:18:19.227
Okay.

01:18:19.673 --> 01:18:21.520
But I'm not running this quarantine.

01:18:22.454 --> 01:18:23.729
Not yet, anyway.

01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:27.730
What do we have to do
to get him out?

01:18:28.122 --> 01:18:29.153
Personally,

01:18:29.456 --> 01:18:32.232
I'm more concerned the thousands of
people trapped in there with him.

01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:34.705
People that I
have been ordered to kill.

01:18:35.867 --> 01:18:37.123
What are you suggesting?

01:18:37.785 --> 01:18:38.939
Nothing.

01:18:40.035 --> 01:18:42.299
- Okay.
- Mind you...

01:18:44.579 --> 01:18:46.253
...If I was in charge,

01:18:46.705 --> 01:18:49.991
my first order would be to
send in a combat team...

01:18:50.022 --> 01:18:51.943
... to rescue that girl
and anyone with her.

01:18:55.001 --> 01:18:56.455
Now if you'll excuse me.

01:18:56.959 --> 01:18:58.608
I have a press conference.

01:19:33.836 --> 01:19:34.643
Shit.

01:19:54.168 --> 01:19:56.087
Well, well, well.

01:19:57.044 --> 01:19:59.399
There's my little bad girl.

01:20:02.130 --> 01:20:03.750
Bring that ass to me.

01:20:03.774 --> 01:20:04.524
Hey!

01:20:20.776 --> 01:20:24.704
<i> The dramatic video by
UBN correspondent, Chase Carter...</i>

01:20:24.745 --> 01:20:26.551
<i> ... raises serious questions about...</i>

01:20:26.606 --> 01:20:28.647
<i> ... FEZA's management of the disaster.</i>

01:20:29.072 --> 01:20:31.561
<i> We now go live to a
joint press conference...</i>

01:20:31.649 --> 01:20:33.599
<i> ... just outside the quarantine wall.</i>

01:20:34.075 --> 01:20:38.593
We are presently conducting an exhaustive audit...

01:20:38.702 --> 01:20:40.159
... on our supply system.

01:20:40.161 --> 01:20:42.875
So far we have
no reason to suspect...

01:20:43.035 --> 01:20:45.251
In spite of the evidence,
you deny your drugs are bad?

01:20:46.829 --> 01:20:48.560
<i> We're still investigating that video.</i>

01:20:48.584 --> 01:20:51.195
You are perfectly aware
the veracity of that video.

01:20:51.791 --> 01:20:53.557
You asked for proof, and Chase Carter...

01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:55.169
... risked his life
to get you that proof.

01:20:55.629 --> 01:20:57.959
And now you would rather let
a lot of innocent people die,

01:20:58.070 --> 01:20:59.960
- to admit you screwed up.
- My priority...

01:21:00.129 --> 01:21:01.665
...is the safety of this country.

01:21:01.881 --> 01:21:03.595
<i> We contained an outbreak.</i>

01:21:04.216 --> 01:21:06.369
<i> This quarantine is a success.</i>

01:21:07.132 --> 01:21:08.163
<i>General...</i>

01:21:08.631 --> 01:21:10.339
... does this look like a success to you,?

01:21:10.922 --> 01:21:13.314
Miss, when knee deep in shit,

01:21:13.385 --> 01:21:15.380
you should be happy
it's not up to your neck...

01:21:15.805 --> 01:21:17.511
... But you're still knee deep in shit.

01:21:18.472 --> 01:21:20.025
Tonight we bear witness ...

01:21:20.054 --> 01:21:22.679
... to the death of a great American city.

01:21:23.261 --> 01:21:25.717
A city that was your job to save.

01:21:27.055 --> 01:21:30.257
Yes, I can think of a lot of words
to describe this situation,

01:21:30.517 --> 01:21:33.453
but "success", is not one of them.

01:21:41.314 --> 01:21:43.931
How was the outbreak spread?
Was it airborne?

01:21:55.445 --> 01:21:56.533
What the hell?

01:21:59.448 --> 01:22:00.295
Hey...

01:22:01.950 --> 01:22:03.609
You can't leave me here like this!

01:22:11.829 --> 01:22:12.844
Hey!

01:22:46.387 --> 01:22:49.103
Turn that up, pretty boy.
That's my jam!

01:22:49.764 --> 01:22:51.033
Son of a bitch!

01:23:09.522 --> 01:23:11.864
This is good,
this is good!

01:23:13.228 --> 01:23:14.357
Shut up!

01:23:43.788 --> 01:23:44.994
Son of a bitch.

01:23:54.042 --> 01:23:55.759
Seriously,
come on.

01:23:56.834 --> 01:23:58.237
Come on, Chase,
you can you do this.

01:24:04.797 --> 01:24:05.693
Yes.

01:24:06.464 --> 01:24:07.847
Come here, stupid zombie.

01:24:08.099 --> 01:24:09.482
Yes, Are you hungry?

01:24:11.886 --> 01:24:12.949
Here you go.

01:24:37.105 --> 01:24:38.736
You're ruining it.

01:24:39.646 --> 01:24:41.105
Eat him.

01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:18.409
<i> The Congress today passed Bill HR251...</i>

01:25:18.444 --> 01:25:21.127
<i> ... handing complete control
to the East Mission quarantine ...</i>

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:22.239
<i> ... to the military.</i>

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:25.863
<i> Some Congressmen are already
calling for an investigation...</i>

01:25:25.994 --> 01:25:28.256
<i> ... into FEZA's embarrassing performance.</i>

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:34.009
We have sent a team to the warehouse.

01:25:35.127 --> 01:25:36.801
There's nobody there but zombies.

01:25:38.289 --> 01:25:39.052
What?

01:25:39.417 --> 01:25:40.614
You did your best.

01:25:41.042 --> 01:25:42.509
More than most people would.

01:25:43.299 --> 01:25:44.475
I'm sorry.

01:25:45.921 --> 01:25:47.257
For what it's worth...

01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:50.905
... we're restarting the evacuation.

01:25:52.095 --> 01:25:53.762
You have saved a lot of lives.

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:55.760
(No Dialog)

01:27:00.896 --> 01:27:02.018
Chase?

01:27:03.900 --> 01:27:06.826
Chase! Oh my God!
Where were you?

01:27:06.850 --> 01:27:08.736
- Are you here?
- I'm at the warehouse.

01:27:09.030 --> 01:27:10.210
I got out.

01:27:10.612 --> 01:27:12.682
At the...
but they said...

01:27:16.327 --> 01:27:18.927
Helicopters, did you see any helicopter?

01:27:19.415 --> 01:27:21.557
No, I didn't see any helicopter.

01:27:24.249 --> 01:27:26.556
The army was suppose to go
in there and get you out.

01:27:26.580 --> 01:27:28.043
Yeah, well obviously they don't care.

01:27:28.625 --> 01:27:31.719
Look, If I can make it to
the wall, can I get out?

01:27:31.753 --> 01:27:32.986
Yeah, you can get out.

01:27:35.592 --> 01:27:37.472
Something is not alright here.

01:27:38.468 --> 01:27:40.452
- What isn't?
- Just trust me...

01:27:40.476 --> 01:27:42.533
When you get here, don't tell anyone
who you are, you understand?

01:27:42.599 --> 01:27:45.296
Not you, not that girl.

01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:11.771
... You, you've got balls,
I'll give you that.

01:28:12.699 --> 01:28:14.498
A man needs
a girl to point...

01:28:14.533 --> 01:28:16.081
... a gun to his head every once in awhile.

01:28:16.105 --> 01:28:18.670
Yeah? Lend me yours and
I can do it again.

01:28:24.127 --> 01:28:25.753
This is gonna hurt.

01:28:27.377 --> 01:28:28.480
Yes? Good,

01:28:28.841 --> 01:28:30.046
I like it rough.

01:28:51.483 --> 01:28:53.444
You know, I saw you on the news.

01:28:54.402 --> 01:28:56.763
You came in here after
the wall went up.

01:28:58.235 --> 01:29:00.121
That takes balls.

01:29:01.612 --> 01:29:02.787
There's no law.

01:29:03.111 --> 01:29:04.135
No order.

01:29:05.284 --> 01:29:07.221
The place was practically begging me.

01:29:12.665 --> 01:29:14.905
And the zombies, don't scare you?

01:29:15.002 --> 01:29:16.227
Brother Z?
No.

01:29:16.379 --> 01:29:19.539
No, I've got pit bulls that cause me
more trouble than that.

01:29:23.676 --> 01:29:24.844
Help!

01:29:25.301 --> 01:29:29.205
You think I'm that stupid?
You think I'm that stupid?

01:29:30.135 --> 01:29:31.804
You gonna wish I killed you.

01:29:32.886 --> 01:29:34.411
Look around.

01:29:34.518 --> 01:29:36.006
You're are already dead.

01:29:44.979 --> 01:29:46.029
Not me.

01:29:59.368 --> 01:30:01.188
What, you're gonna blow us all up?

01:30:01.997 --> 01:30:03.207
Maybe...

01:30:03.496 --> 01:30:05.000
Maybe I will,

01:30:05.535 --> 01:30:06.914
or maybe...

01:30:07.036 --> 01:30:09.154
I'll just blow up that wall out there.

01:30:10.206 --> 01:30:11.906
And that's your plan to get out?

01:30:13.503 --> 01:30:15.222
Who said I wanted out?

01:30:17.712 --> 01:30:20.461
I'm king of this shit,

01:30:21.718 --> 01:30:23.153
Before all this,

01:30:23.178 --> 01:30:25.064
I was just a nine to fiver...

01:30:25.095 --> 01:30:28.383
... I was trying to
get through the goddamn day.

01:30:28.638 --> 01:30:30.152
My life meant nothing.

01:30:31.974 --> 01:30:33.805
I was nothing.

01:30:35.519 --> 01:30:37.870
But now...
Now?

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:42.245
It's a paradise,

01:30:44.023 --> 01:30:45.368
But now...

01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:48.708
... now they want to go, and bomb it.

01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:49.980
Right?

01:30:52.034 --> 01:30:53.176
But...

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:57.793
What if it is too
big to bomb?

01:30:59.118 --> 01:31:00.693
See, it got me thinking.

01:31:01.537 --> 01:31:03.177
What if...?

01:31:03.201 --> 01:31:06.477
Mr. Z out for a walk.

01:31:07.378 --> 01:31:10.347
Expand his horizons.

01:31:10.378 --> 01:31:11.486
But...

01:31:11.587 --> 01:31:12.842
See now...

01:31:13.380 --> 01:31:17.359
The old Z...
old Z can't do it on his own.

01:31:17.552 --> 01:31:18.804
No no no no,

01:31:18.828 --> 01:31:20.227
But me and Z?

01:31:21.929 --> 01:31:26.452
Me and Z, got what you
call "a mutual interest".

01:31:26.476 --> 01:31:29.440
So, no!
No! No!

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.272
I don't want out of this shit!

01:31:32.354 --> 01:31:35.872
I'm taking this shit with me!

01:31:46.658 --> 01:31:48.205
Get on your knees...

01:31:48.406 --> 01:31:49.557
Now!

01:31:55.828 --> 01:31:57.252
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:14.718 --> 01:32:15.988
What are you going to do?

01:32:16.295 --> 01:32:18.250
Huh? What are you going to do?

01:32:35.027 --> 01:32:37.378
King of the fucking Zombies!

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:43.749
No! No!

01:32:44.074 --> 01:32:45.488
No!

01:33:04.382 --> 01:33:05.920
Todd get that bitch!

01:33:06.718 --> 01:33:10.042
Where are you going? Huh?
Where are you going?

01:33:11.926 --> 01:33:13.273
You bitch!

01:33:20.728 --> 01:33:21.620
What are you doing?

01:33:21.793 --> 01:33:25.172
Oh, no.

01:33:25.196 --> 01:33:26.536
- Come on.
- Yes!

01:33:44.453 --> 01:33:45.565
No!

01:33:45.997 --> 01:33:47.664
What? You're not done
with her yet?

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:51.164
No, I'm not done with her yet.

01:33:51.293 --> 01:33:53.789
I'm gonna rip every little piece...

01:34:23.863 --> 01:34:26.052
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

01:34:33.203 --> 01:34:34.313
Kill her.

01:35:37.831 --> 01:35:39.007
Come on.

01:35:49.631 --> 01:35:52.273
Get off!
Get off!

01:35:52.512 --> 01:35:53.774
No!

01:36:01.309 --> 01:36:04.308
<i> Nooooooo!</i>

01:36:06.143 --> 01:36:07.504
Nice swing.

01:36:07.528 --> 01:36:09.183
Drive, Krabowski.

01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:20.874
<i> As we count down the hours...</i>

01:36:20.898 --> 01:36:24.306
<i> ... for the inevitable, tragic
firebombing of Mission East...</i>

01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:26.271
<i> ...we now join General Lyons...</i>

01:36:26.295 --> 01:36:27.898
<i> ... for this important update.</i>

01:36:27.922 --> 01:36:29.260
For more than a year,

01:36:29.286 --> 01:36:31.155
we have worked very closely
with Phenotrans...

01:36:31.179 --> 01:36:33.792
... to improve how we treat infected people.

01:36:34.286 --> 01:36:36.806
When survivors pass
through this gate,

01:36:37.127 --> 01:36:39.241
we will implant them with these.

01:36:40.211 --> 01:36:42.754
This chip contains year supply...

01:36:42.833 --> 01:36:44.537
... of highly concentrated Zombrex.

01:36:45.676 --> 01:36:48.049
No more daily shots.

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:49.631
No more human error.

01:36:50.427 --> 01:36:53.251
No more tragedies like this one.

01:36:53.306 --> 01:36:55.171
<i> - Is Phenotrans involved?
- Thank you. </i>

01:36:58.978 --> 01:37:00.974
<i> - You use Zombrex every day?
- Every day. </i>

01:37:01.911 --> 01:37:04.988
<i>I want you to take
this and wait over there.</i>

01:37:06.855 --> 01:37:08.421
Get the hell away from me.

01:37:08.445 --> 01:37:10.076
I know you're pissed at
me, and you have every right to be.

01:37:10.100 --> 01:37:11.869
I did what I did to save my friend.

01:37:11.986 --> 01:37:15.356
Oh, you lied on national TV,
and you cost me my career.

01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:16.762
Why would I be pissed?

01:37:16.863 --> 01:37:18.362
I didn't lie.

01:37:18.567 --> 01:37:20.652
I never sent you to that warehouse.

01:37:20.676 --> 01:37:22.517
You put a note on my car.

01:37:23.246 --> 01:37:24.832
No, I didn't.

01:37:26.163 --> 01:37:28.019
Son of a bitch.

01:37:28.121 --> 01:37:29.437
Lyons...

01:37:29.622 --> 01:37:31.212
- He screwed us both.
- Yeah.

01:37:31.247 --> 01:37:32.491
Me, more than you...

01:37:32.515 --> 01:37:34.303
So what the hell is going on?

01:37:34.878 --> 01:37:36.168
Okay, look...

01:37:36.192 --> 01:37:38.873
Phenotrans came to us
years ago with these chips.

01:37:38.897 --> 01:37:41.725
It was a civil rights nightmare,
obviously.

01:37:41.801 --> 01:37:44.115
So we passed.
Now look what's happened.

01:37:44.137 --> 01:37:46.880
The Army has been set up to
take over Homeland Defense.

01:37:46.887 --> 01:37:49.580
Lyons is a frick'in hero.

01:37:49.934 --> 01:37:53.198
and they can put these computer chips
in who ever they feel like.

01:37:57.604 --> 01:37:59.128
How do I fix this?

01:38:04.233 --> 01:38:05.381
Okay, look.

01:38:05.484 --> 01:38:09.114
Does your kid have any
other information from the warehouse?

01:38:10.281 --> 01:38:11.724
He's got pictures.

01:38:15.448 --> 01:38:16.665
Wait a minute.

01:38:19.871 --> 01:38:21.041
Check it out,

01:38:22.206 --> 01:38:25.349
The Army already had those chips
on their trucks when they arrived.

01:38:27.544 --> 01:38:29.551
That's not even the half of it.

01:38:37.124 --> 01:38:38.224
It's okay.

01:38:39.260 --> 01:38:40.359
Thanks.

01:38:42.386 --> 01:38:43.266
Hey,

01:38:43.638 --> 01:38:46.430
I'm leaving and I just thought
maybe I could...

01:38:46.454 --> 01:38:48.552
... get some closure on
Chase before I left.

01:38:48.576 --> 01:38:49.914
I'm sorry about him.

01:38:51.023 --> 01:38:52.191
Thanks.

01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:55.486
Listen, can  I talk to the
officer who led that mission?

01:38:55.510 --> 01:38:59.018
I think it would make me feel better
knowing what he saw.

01:38:59.527 --> 01:39:02.212
That off the books mission
I did it as a favor...

01:39:03.152 --> 01:39:04.852
I'm sorry, I can't do that.

01:39:05.696 --> 01:39:06.842
I know.

01:39:06.988 --> 01:39:11.175
I'm just trying to make sure
I did everything I could,

01:39:12.241 --> 01:39:14.322
But you said he did make
a difference and I think...

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:16.557
I think he would
like that.

01:39:17.207 --> 01:39:20.107
That line of survivors out there
proves that.

01:39:20.791 --> 01:39:22.563
Let me add something personal.

01:39:22.708 --> 01:39:25.707
I came here with orders
to wipe this place out.

01:39:25.964 --> 01:39:27.248
But instead...

01:39:27.756 --> 01:39:29.016
... my boys...

01:39:29.422 --> 01:39:31.756
...are out there handing out blankets!

01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:33.273
And hot meals.

01:39:33.425 --> 01:39:36.112
Every one of them,
me in particular...

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:37.295
...owe that to him.

01:39:38.137 --> 01:39:39.168
And you.

01:39:42.099 --> 01:39:45.420
You've had enough time to get
the new chips here?

01:39:45.634 --> 01:39:47.589
This is the US Army,
darling.

01:39:47.732 --> 01:39:50.561
When lives are on the line,
we move pretty damn fast.

01:39:51.234 --> 01:39:52.733
That's a welcome change.

01:39:52.735 --> 01:39:55.296
And Phenotrans, they can move up?

01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:57.790
Well, they are not military,
they're not bad.

01:39:58.157 --> 01:39:59.929
With three or four days warning.

01:40:00.030 --> 01:40:01.422
They get the job done.

01:40:02.698 --> 01:40:04.043
Three or four days?

01:40:08.118 --> 01:40:09.295
Thanks.

01:40:18.445 --> 01:40:20.095
<i> Survivors would
only need...</i>

01:40:20.123 --> 01:40:22.550
<i> ... to refill the drug
once a year,</i>

01:40:22.574 --> 01:40:25.166
<i> Would anyone who has this
disease not want that?</i>

01:40:25.201 --> 01:40:26.606
<i> Maybe they wouldn't want to be tracked...</i>

01:40:26.630 --> 01:40:27.702
<i> ... by the army 24/7.</i>

01:40:28.126 --> 01:40:30.628
<i> Reading their vital signs,
tracking their movements.</i>

01:40:30.962 --> 01:40:32.591
<i> You want the
Army to know...</i>

01:40:32.615 --> 01:40:34.166
<i> ... every time you're
taking a dump, Sue? Come on!</i>

01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:37.510
<i> The Army is not tracking
every time I take a dump, Frank.</i>

01:40:37.534 --> 01:40:39.518
<i> - You don't know that.
- This is ridiculous. </i>

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:42.299
<i> The only thing they will be tracking...</i>

01:40:42.323 --> 01:40:43.772
<i> ...is if you need more drugs,</i>

01:40:43.796 --> 01:40:44.668
<i> - Really?
- Yes. </i>

01:40:44.792 --> 01:40:45.706
<i> Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:46.859
<i> Because most people...</i>

01:40:46.883 --> 01:40:47.841
<i> ... can't be trusted to remember...</i>

01:40:47.865 --> 01:40:49.012
<i> ... when their life saving drug,</i>

01:40:49.173 --> 01:40:50.079
<i> is about to run out.</i>

01:40:50.237 --> 01:40:51.547
<i> But what if does more than that?</i>

01:40:51.574 --> 01:40:53.148
<i> What if it listens to your
phone calls?</i>

01:40:53.161 --> 01:40:56.052
<i> Knows who you're talking too,
knows what you are talking about?</i>

01:40:56.290 --> 01:40:58.612
<i> - Knows if you're about to protest something,
- You're crazy.</i>

01:40:58.636 --> 01:41:00.420
<i> What happens when they don't like
what you're doing,</i>

01:41:00.501 --> 01:41:02.716
<i> come to your house in
a unmarked van...</i>

01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:05.940
<i> throw you in the back and take you
to a secret base in Uzbekistan...</i>

01:41:05.964 --> 01:41:09.012
<i> ... where they will hook up
electrodes to your ball sack...</i>

01:41:09.929 --> 01:41:11.316
<i> ... and make you talk?</i>

01:41:11.351 --> 01:41:12.922
<i> - Frank...
- That's a fact  ,</i>

01:41:12.946 --> 01:41:14.098
<i> - No
- Google it...</i>

01:41:14.143 --> 01:41:17.614
<i> That's is simply, bat shit crazy.</i>

01:41:17.638 --> 01:41:20.010
<i> Well, they've called me
that since Willamette.</i>

01:41:20.234 --> 01:41:21.358
<i> But guess what?</i>

01:41:21.364 --> 01:41:22.620
<i> I'm still here.</i>

01:41:29.373 --> 01:41:32.786
We have Bravo team
guest estimate at one kilometer.

01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:34.586
Make sure we have
some guys on roofs.

01:41:34.610 --> 01:41:36.987
Okay, we have a lookout
in the northwest corner too.

01:41:40.268 --> 01:41:41.108
Hey.

01:41:41.558 --> 01:41:44.099
So, Phenotrans need
three or four days...

01:41:44.562 --> 01:41:46.112
... to get those
chips to the military.

01:41:46.810 --> 01:41:49.284
So, how did the bastards have
them when they arrived?

01:41:49.308 --> 01:41:50.547
Exactly.

01:41:50.567 --> 01:41:53.710
Wait, your friend
has got the FEZA waybill...

01:41:53.745 --> 01:41:54.918
...straight to the warehouse.

01:41:54.942 --> 01:41:56.530
But no one at FEZA
has heard of him.

01:41:59.330 --> 01:42:01.274
Let's see if the military has.

01:42:02.921 --> 01:42:04.486
Norton,
look at you.

01:42:05.631 --> 01:42:07.417
Yeah,
show me that waybill.

01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:18.455
Those fuckers!

01:42:18.479 --> 01:42:20.103
The shipment came from Fort Carson.

01:42:20.150 --> 01:42:21.520
That's General Lyons base.

01:42:23.738 --> 01:42:25.968
Sit tight, The world got to see this.

01:42:29.623 --> 01:42:30.426
Hey, wait...

01:42:32.335 --> 01:42:34.004
No! No!
Please! Please!

01:42:34.028 --> 01:42:35.247
Shit.

01:42:42.722 --> 01:42:44.503
Tear it apart, if you have too.

01:42:44.603 --> 01:42:45.920
Check everywhere.

01:42:56.869 --> 01:42:57.966
Chase,

01:42:58.454 --> 01:43:01.468
<i> the army planted
the bad Zombrex in there.</i>

01:43:01.747 --> 01:43:05.073
So track the label of that case
you took the picture of.

01:43:05.086 --> 01:43:06.866
If you can't find me,
it will lead to them.

01:43:25.196 --> 01:43:27.608
Halt! Get down! Get down!

01:43:27.701 --> 01:43:28.905
On the ground, now!

01:43:29.248 --> 01:43:30.687
Check her out, check her!

01:43:44.098 --> 01:43:46.458
<i> Leave your vehicle.</i>

01:43:49.771 --> 01:43:52.971
<i> Walk towards the wall, slowly.</i>

01:43:57.283 --> 01:43:59.890
<i> Keep your hands where
we can see them.</i>

01:44:02.164 --> 01:44:03.312
They're not going to shoot us?

01:44:04.374 --> 01:44:05.839
No, we're gonna be fine.

01:44:15.265 --> 01:44:17.145
Oh, shit.
Come on!

01:44:28.325 --> 01:44:30.664
<i> Turn down the radio.</i>

01:44:32.789 --> 01:44:34.171
I'm sorry, what?

01:44:34.624 --> 01:44:37.665
<i> Turn off the radio now!</i>

01:44:38.294 --> 01:44:39.534
Okay.

01:44:44.221 --> 01:44:46.017
We need to see those hands.

01:44:47.266 --> 01:44:49.598
<i> Your hands, let me see them.</i>

01:44:52.982 --> 01:44:55.462
<i> Step away from the vehicle.</i>

01:44:55.528 --> 01:44:57.621
- Is everything OK?

01:44:57.726 --> 01:44:58.694
Yeah, Yeah.

<i> Step away from the vehicle, now!</i>

01:45:02.245 --> 01:45:03.570
No problem!

01:45:04.456 --> 01:45:05.853
No problem!

01:45:21.438 --> 01:45:23.907
I lost the target!
I can't see!

01:45:29.948 --> 01:45:33.023
Conserve your ammo,
wait for targets.

01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:41.727
Come on,
boys and girls.

01:46:02.575 --> 01:46:04.345
Welcome...

01:46:04.371 --> 01:46:07.694
... to the after party,
to the party!

01:46:15.219 --> 01:46:16.573
Is that's a fucking bomb?

01:46:16.844 --> 01:46:17.990
Son of a bitch.

01:46:23.099 --> 01:46:24.138
Go.

01:46:44.506 --> 01:46:47.025
<i> - I think I see movement.
- Open fire!</i>

01:48:24.852 --> 01:48:25.823
Come on!

01:48:40.042 --> 01:48:41.038
Crystal!

01:49:16.208 --> 01:49:17.060
Bomb!

01:49:21.430 --> 01:49:22.411
Clear the area.

01:49:26.684 --> 01:49:28.692
Crystal!
The bomb!

01:49:30.230 --> 01:49:31.110
Go!

01:49:51.762 --> 01:49:53.055
This is gonna hurt!

01:50:18.839 --> 01:50:19.822
Run!

01:51:01.941 --> 01:51:03.282
<i> Is this a secure line?</i>

01:51:03.443 --> 01:51:04.563
Yes, sir,It is,

01:51:04.821 --> 01:51:06.078
<i> You've done well, General.</i>

01:51:06.322 --> 01:51:08.646
<i> Public pressure has worked
just as you predicted.</i>

01:51:09.491 --> 01:51:12.305
I believe we have help
congress and the press...

01:51:12.618 --> 01:51:14.217
... To better understand
their priorities, sir,

01:51:15.082 --> 01:51:16.861
<i> I have the go order in my hand.</i>

01:51:17.375 --> 01:51:18.829
<i> You have your green light, Lyons.</i>

01:51:19.213 --> 01:51:20.550
Thank you, General Hemlock.

01:51:30.601 --> 01:51:33.226
We are T minus five minutes.

01:51:46.955 --> 01:51:47.827
You okay?

01:51:49.001 --> 01:51:50.747
Yeah, are we done?

01:51:50.752 --> 01:51:51.782
Almost.

01:51:54.052 --> 01:51:55.429
Hey, you mind if I plug this in?

01:51:56.013 --> 01:51:57.374
The battery is low.

01:52:02.437 --> 01:52:05.933
Well, I guess you must
be pretty happy.

01:52:06.692 --> 01:52:08.304
Finally got your big story.

01:52:11.327 --> 01:52:12.870
I'm happy we got out alive.

Thank you,

Sorry, I've gotta...

I haven't been able to find Jordan nowhere.

01:52:37.192 --> 01:52:38.118
Yeah, Go.

01:52:38.358 --> 01:52:39.521
I wanted to thank her.

01:52:41.071 --> 01:52:42.173
I'll be right back.

01:52:46.079 --> 01:52:47.496
This will only sting for a moment.

01:52:50.548 --> 01:52:51.531
What?

01:52:55.467 --> 01:52:58.488
And in three, two, one.

01:52:59.968 --> 01:53:00.837
We're up.

a sigh of relief.</i>

01:53:21.169 --> 01:53:22.452
<i> We survived.</i>

01:53:22.711 --> 01:53:24.598
<i> And there is every reason to hope...</i>

01:53:24.833 --> 01:53:28.209
<i> ... this is the last time
we will face such a crisis.</i>

01:53:28.384 --> 01:53:30.312
<i> There is no reason
to believe that at all.</i>

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:32.646
<i> The zombie virus is out there...</i>

01:53:33.181 --> 01:53:36.623
<i> ...waiting, resting,
rethinking it's strategy.</i>

01:53:39.358 --> 01:53:40.534
<i> When it's ready,</i>

01:53:41.070 --> 01:53:42.224
<i> it will be back.</i>

01:53:43.239 --> 01:53:44.787
<i> All we can do is...</i>

01:53:46.243 --> 01:53:47.690
<i> ... hope we are ready too.</i>

<i> The army planted
bad Zombrex in there.</i>

01:54:55.922 --> 01:54:58.399
<i> The tracking label on that crate
you took a picture of.</i>

01:54:58.416 --> 01:55:00.209
<i> If you can't find me,
will lead you to them.</i>

01:55:16.624 --> 01:55:19.306
