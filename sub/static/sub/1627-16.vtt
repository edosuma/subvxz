Once upon a time, an evil queen

00:04.380 --> 00:09.215
banished every storybook character
you’ve ever known to our world.

and who can break the spell?

There is no place for us together.

00:17.727 --> 00:19.183
If I drink that,
PM no longer love him.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.727
You won't even remember who he is.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.141
I told them they should be together.

since Kathryn went missing.

00:27.570 --> 00:30.277
EMMA: There's a human heart inside it.
We found fingerprints.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.353
They were Mary Margaret's.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.768
Go. I'll take care of them.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.012
Red, I'm not leaving you.

01:01.103 --> 01:03.845
Find Snow. That's all that matters.
Find her.

01:03.940 --> 01:04.929
What are you gonna do?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.901
I'm giving you a head start.

01:34.637 --> 01:35.877
Please turn to the right.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.136
Emma, this is a mistake.
I didn't kill Kathryn!

01:38.224 --> 01:39.634
Of course you didn't.

01:39.725 --> 01:41.761
But while I am your friend,
I am also the Sheriff,

01:41.852 --> 01:43.308
and I have to go
where the evidence leads.

01:43.396 --> 01:45.512
Which points to me?

01:45.606 --> 01:49.895
Emma, yesterday, it was David.
There's something not right here.

01:49.986 --> 01:54.571
I know. But your fingerprints
are on that box. And his are not.

01:54.657 --> 01:57.194
And so now we have to deal with this.

01:57.285 --> 02:01.153
Evidence that says
I cut out Kathryn's heart

02:01.247 --> 02:04.614
and buried it in the woods.
This is insane.

02:04.709 --> 02:09.078
If I don't book you, with all this
evidence, it's gonna look like favoritism.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.957
And then Regina will have cause
and she will fire me.

02:11.048 --> 02:12.037
And then you know what she'll do?

02:12.133 --> 02:14.920
She'll bring in someone
who will railroad you.

02:15.011 --> 02:17.172
So please,
just try to be patient and trust me.

02:17.263 --> 02:20.505
We can't even move forward till we
verify the heart belonged to Kathryn.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.511
And I'm still waiting
for the DNA test results.

02:23.602 --> 02:26.969
But in the meantime,
you need to bear with me.

02:27.064 --> 02:28.929
I have to ask you a few questions.

02:31.110 --> 02:34.477

to be here tonight.

I've changed?

You broke my mug!

04:26.183 --> 04:28.390
You're lucky
it wasn't that mug you call a face.

(SNOW WHITE SIGHS)

04:37.027 --> 04:38.563
That potion you took,

04:38.654 --> 04:40.155
the one that erased the Prince
from your mind,

04:40.239 --> 04:42.605
you haven't been the same
since you drank it.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.817
That helped me forget whatever
or whomever I needed to forget,

04:45.911 --> 04:48.163
and I'm clearly better off for it.

04:49.206 --> 04:52.744
That potion was the solution,
not the problem.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.292
The problem is that I'm living here,

04:55.379 --> 04:58.587
in a house full of dwarfs

04:58.674 --> 05:01.916
instead of in my palace,
with my father as a princess.

05:02.011 --> 05:04.593
But I can't do that anymore, can I?
Because he was murdered.

05:04.680 --> 05:08.298
Murdered by the same woman
who sent a huntsman to kill me.

05:08.392 --> 05:11.634
Snow, your anger towards the Queen
is understandable.

05:11.729 --> 05:14.562
It's just not fair to take it out
on your friends.

05:21.739 --> 05:22.728
You're right.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.564
I should be taking it out on her.

05:27.453 --> 05:29.489
Oh, wait. No, revenge is not the answer.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.660
No, it's gonna change you.

It'll turn you into something darker
than you can imagine.

because I'm leaving.

To kill the Queen.

06:04.406 --> 06:05.907
Hello, Ms. Blanchard.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.148
What is she doing here?

06:08.244 --> 06:12.078
She asked to be here as a third party
to make sure that I stay impartial.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.120
It can only help you.

06:16.627 --> 06:17.616
I have nothing to hide.

06:19.421 --> 06:20.706
Ask me anything.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.258
(CLICKS)

06:24.885 --> 06:27.342
The heart was found buried
near the old toll bridge.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.717
And it had been cut out by what
appears to be a hunting knife.

that bridge before?

06:33.102 --> 06:35.388

We were having an affair.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.660
I'm not proud of what happened.
And I'm sorry.

But that doesn't change the fact
that I did not kill Kathryn.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.549
Yes, it's myjewelry box.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.509
Don't you see what's happening here?

07:14.143 --> 07:15.883
Someone stole that box
and put the heart in it.

07:15.978 --> 07:18.219
I didn't have anything to do with it!
I'm innocent!

MS. Blanchard. It's okay.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.356
I know what you're going through.

07:23.444 --> 07:27.983
I know what it's like to lose someone
you love, to be publicly humiliated.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.450
Put me in a very dark place.

07:30.993 --> 07:31.982
Changed me.

07:33.329 --> 07:36.036
I can only imagine what losing
David Nolan did to you.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.078
I haven't changed.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.122
I'm still the same person
I've always been.

07:39.209 --> 07:40.335
A good person.

07:40.419 --> 07:42.580
I did not do this.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.680
How do you know she didn't do it?

07:59.688 --> 08:01.770
If that box was stolen from her
as she claims,

08:01.857 --> 08:04.849
don't you think
there'd be signs of a break-in?

08:05.861 --> 08:08.227
You're her roommate.
Tell me, has there been a break-in?

08:09.406 --> 08:13.115
She is a woman
who's had her heart broken.

aren't you?

13:09.373 --> 13:12.706

13:25.180 --> 13:26.761
You know I'm a writer.

13:26.848 --> 13:30.386
So I'm partial to finding my answers
in a literary form.

13:31.186 --> 13:32.392
It's just a book.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.469
Is it?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.304
Yeah.

Let's just say that I'm a believer.

I'm here for Emma.

Why don't you just tell her?

14:23.405 --> 14:28.741
Well, there are some people,
like you and me, we can go on faith.

14:28.827 --> 14:32.240
But others, like Emma,
they need proof.

14:32.456 --> 14:35.243

I got trapped in a sinkhole.

I've never seen someone
so bloodthirsty.

She is not a killer. I know her.

Mary Margaret,

16:03.213 --> 16:04.999
they have been gnawing away at me.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.588
She didn't do this.

16:10.846 --> 16:12.962
I understand
what you're going through.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.798
It's painful when someone
we care about betrays us.

She's a good person. I know her.

Maybe you don't.
Maybe you just want to.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.188
Everyone has a dark side, David.

16:24.317 --> 16:29.437
Yeah, sure. But having a dark side
and doing something so evil,

16:29.531 --> 16:31.613
that's a different thing.
That's not what she is.

16:31.700 --> 16:32.940
Perhaps.

16:33.034 --> 16:37.778
I always believe that evil
isn't born. It's made.

16:37.873 --> 16:39.579
All due respect, Regina,

16:40.167 --> 16:42.328
I don't think you know much about evil.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.416
Well, if she didn't do it, then who did?

16:47.507 --> 16:49.589
I don't know, that's what
I've been trying to figure out.

16:50.177 --> 16:53.419
But those blackouts I've been having,
they've made everything so hazy.

16:54.222 --> 16:56.338
Please tell me
you're not accusing yourself.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.549
You know, maybe if
I can clear up my missing time,

16:58.643 --> 17:00.975
I could prove
Mary Margaret's innocence.

17:01.062 --> 17:02.598
You're very sweet, David.

17:03.273 --> 17:05.059

the heating vent in my bedroom is!

Well, someone did. And they put
a hunting knife in there.

17:23.251 --> 17:26.368
I checked for signs of a break-in.
But there weren't any.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.666
You don't believe me?

17:29.758 --> 17:30.838
Of course I do.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.812

why I was so adept at contracts?

I've been following the details
of your case, Ms. Blanchard.

17:52.530 --> 17:54.907
And I think you'd be well-advised
to bring me on as your counsel.

17:54.991 --> 17:56.447
And why is that?

17:56.534 --> 17:58.866
Because the Sheriff had me arrested
for nearly beating a man to death,

17:58.954 --> 18:02.367
and I managed to persuade thejudge
to drop the charges.

18:02.457 --> 18:03.617

isn't what's needed here.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.749
Exerting influence may be exactly
what's needed here.

What's needed here
is for me to do myjob.

I'm invested in your future.

19:08.273 --> 19:12.642
That potion you gave Snow,
it changed her. She's not the same.

19:13.153 --> 19:16.987
Well, of course it changed her.
It took away her love.

there's no way to bring her back.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.799

I haven't been able to bottle.

If you can bottle love,

19:45.435 --> 19:47.050
you can do anything.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.353
But you don't care about that, do you?

19:52.734 --> 19:55.771
Now, what is it you really want?

19:55.862 --> 19:59.696
I want your help. To kill the Queen.

This is how you kill the Queen!

20:15.256 --> 20:17.292
How will that help me
get into the castle?

20:17.425 --> 20:20.007
No, no, no, that's impossible.

to the Summer Palace.

and you'll be hidden from Sight.

that weapon, you do it alone.

to do anything, dearie.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.038

what happened during them.

You mean, what did you do to her?

22:17.253 --> 22:18.914
You caused her pain.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.120
Without that pain,

22:20.215 --> 22:22.957
she would never have drank
my potion to forget about you.

22:23.051 --> 22:25.884
That's what changed her.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.970
Undo the potion.
All magic can be broken.

22:29.057 --> 22:32.470
Oh, yes, with "twoo wuv."

22:32.560 --> 22:35.176
So that's it, then.
True love's kiss will awaken her?

22:35.271 --> 22:37.057
Most certainly.

But you better be quick.

23:20.483 --> 23:22.144

23:22.235 --> 23:26.854
she becomes as evil
as the woman whose life she takes.

She can never become that evil.

25:53.469 --> 25:54.970
"Charming"?

25:55.221 --> 25:58.008
(SCOFFS) Beginning to see
why I drank that potion.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.014
This doesn't make any sense.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.388
True love's kiss should
have restored your memories.

26:03.479 --> 26:06.846
It's not true love
because I don't love you.

26:06.941 --> 26:10.604
Yes, you do. You just don't remember.
You love me and I love you.

26:10.862 --> 26:15.322
Words, words, words.
That's all that love is.

26:15.408 --> 26:19.367
And unfortunately for you,
words don't mean anything to me.

26:19.454 --> 26:21.570
You know what does
mean something to me?

26:21.664 --> 26:24.781
Taking action and that's exactly
what I'm going to go do.

26:25.168 --> 26:28.205
Snow. Snow! Listen to me.

26:28.296 --> 26:30.457
You can't do this.

26:30.548 --> 26:33.290
It's not who you want to be.
You can't kill her.

26:33.593 --> 26:36.835
Really? Watch me.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.513
Don't do it! Snow!

26:41.142 --> 26:42.131
Snow!

26:44.437 --> 26:46.974
ARCHIE: David, listen very closely.
Can you hear me?

26:47.064 --> 26:48.645
-Yes.
-Good.

26:49.150 --> 26:51.892
Okay, lwant you
to go back in your memory.

26:51.986 --> 26:55.023
Back to the last time
you and Kathryn spoke.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.320
Last thing you remember.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.072
Tell me, where are you?

27:00.453 --> 27:02.034
In my bedroom.

27:02.705 --> 27:03.865
VVhen?

27:04.916 --> 27:06.497
The night she left.

27:06.751 --> 27:08.161
And what were you doing?

27:09.086 --> 27:11.293
I called her on her cell.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.416
What did you talk about?

27:14.008 --> 27:17.171
She said she realized
she needed to start a new life.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.511
Without me.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.519
And she thought Mary Margaret
and I should be together.

27:27.438 --> 27:29.349
And how did that conversation end?

27:29.732 --> 27:31.814
She said she was hurt.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.434
But she wanted me to be happy.

27:36.531 --> 27:39.022
And do you remember
anything after that?

27:39.116 --> 27:43.075
Yes. I saw Mary Margaret in the woods.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.618
And what was she doing there?

27:45.706 --> 27:47.367
(WHOOSHING)

27:53.881 --> 27:55.462
PRINCE CHARMING: You can't kill her.

27:55.550 --> 27:57.632
Really? Watch me.

27:57.718 --> 27:58.753
PRINCE CHARMING: Don't do it!

27:58.845 --> 27:59.800
ARCHIE: David.

27:59.887 --> 28:01.047

-(GASPS)

28:01.222 --> 28:02.211
What happened?

28:02.306 --> 28:05.048
I had to wake you up.
You went too deep into hypnosis.

28:05.142 --> 28:07.633
Something was disturbing you.
What did you see?

28:07.728 --> 28:09.309
It was...

28:11.274 --> 28:12.810
What?

28:12.900 --> 28:14.856
Tell me, David, I can help you.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.902
David! David, tell me, what did
you see? I can help you.

28:19.156 --> 28:20.692
No, you can't.

28:21.868 --> 28:22.903
David!

28:23.494 --> 28:25.735

28:31.836 --> 28:33.246

28:33.546 --> 28:34.752
You must be James.

28:35.715 --> 28:36.795
You can talk?

28:36.966 --> 28:39.582
Yeah, and you can listen.
Name's Jiminy.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.381
When Snow began acting differently,

28:43.472 --> 28:45.087
her friends, the dwarfs,
asked me to intervene.

28:45.182 --> 28:48.094
But I'm afraid Iwasn't much help.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.559
I didn't do any better.

28:51.689 --> 28:54.146
Can you get me out of here?
I have to stop her.

28:54.442 --> 28:55.602
I'll try.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.934
(SPITS) What's your plan?

28:59.071 --> 29:00.186
I don't know.

29:00.281 --> 29:02.272
I tried everything to make her
remember who I am.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.857
-But nothing worked.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.203
It sounds like you're approaching
this the wrong way.

29:13.294 --> 29:18.084
How can she remember who you are
when she's lost sight of who she is?

Dr. Hopper helped me remember

what happened during my blackouts.

And?

33:07.695 --> 33:08.810
Uh...

33:09.238 --> 33:14.232
I only got pieces of the memory.

33:16.620 --> 33:17.700
We were in the woods.

33:19.081 --> 33:21.367
And I kept saying, "Don't do it."

33:22.001 --> 33:23.116
Don't do what?

33:23.836 --> 33:25.326
"Don't kill her."

That's what I kept saying.

You think you remember me
wanting to kill Kathryn?

33:37.391 --> 33:39.473
Can you explain
why I have that memory?

33:41.770 --> 33:45.388
David, are you asking me

33:45.524 --> 33:48.482
if I had something to do
with Kathryn's murder?

33:48.777 --> 33:52.235
The Sheriff found a heart in our spot.

33:53.449 --> 33:56.987
It was in yourjewelry box, the
weapon was found in your apartment,

33:57.077 --> 33:59.568
I have these memories.

34:01.290 --> 34:02.780

When your phone records came back,

34:08.547 --> 34:11.038
when I found you
wandering in the woods,

34:11.133 --> 34:14.125
when everyone thought
you killed Kathryn,

34:14.803 --> 34:16.589
I stood by you.

34:18.724 --> 34:22.091
I never once doubted you.

34:23.646 --> 34:26.103
And now that everything
is pointing to me,

34:27.733 --> 34:32.818
you actually think I am capable
of that kind of evil?

No, Snow. You can't do it.

I can't let the King just kill him.

came back on the heart.

38:12.875 --> 38:14.957
And the DNA was a match for Kathryn.

38:18.005 --> 38:19.085

proof of the death,

38:33.854 --> 38:37.267
we have enough evidence to move
forward with the case against you.

38:46.116 --> 38:47.105
Yeah.

one thing for certain.

Why don't you confront her?

I suspect anything.
