WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:02.039
But I just need to know if
you'll give me another chance.

00:02.047 --> 00:04.966
No. Maybe after the movie wraps.

00:06.426 --> 00:08.219
- Dammit, Rainer.
- Relax, Alan.

00:08.220 --> 00:10.179
It's in my blood. My dad was a stuntman.

00:10.180 --> 00:12.807
He worked on that movie with
you and my mom. Back in '93.

00:12.808 --> 00:14.725
Okay, you've been right, so what?

00:14.726 --> 00:17.395
So I can get you back
on this movie is what.

00:17.396 --> 00:19.981
We all agree that the script
needs a little more work

00:19.982 --> 00:21.524
before we can move to
green-light the project.

00:21.525 --> 00:22.858
I thought Mike Tanen loved the script?

00:22.859 --> 00:23.943
I've got Kevin O'Hare

00:23.944 --> 00:25.653
the Pulitzer Prize winning playwright

00:25.654 --> 00:27.530
to agree to do a full rewrite.

00:27.531 --> 00:28.781
Why are you dealing with Aidan's bookie?

00:28.782 --> 00:31.367
Because every debt
Aidan owed, I now owe.

00:31.368 --> 00:33.327
And if I don't pay back all the money

00:33.328 --> 00:34.620
they're gonna kill me.

00:34.621 --> 00:35.872
When Brandy Michaels needed bail money

00:35.873 --> 00:37.331
she was pretty eager to chat.

00:37.332 --> 00:39.500
So, what, you're just gonna
hate your best friend now

00:39.501 --> 00:40.585
that I-I got it?

00:40.586 --> 00:42.253
Because I didn't think that you would

00:42.254 --> 00:44.088
but you just waltzed right in

00:44.089 --> 00:46.173
and you got it, like everything you do.

00:46.174 --> 00:47.968
It's just so easy.

01:23.712 --> 01:25.755
Still looking for him, sweetheart?

01:25.756 --> 01:26.798
Mmm.

01:27.507 --> 01:29.675
Well, I think I see him

01:29.676 --> 01:32.595
hiding right over there.

01:32.596 --> 01:34.514
Go get him.

01:37.351 --> 01:38.518
August...

01:39.603 --> 01:41.647
we have to talk about this.

01:43.732 --> 01:46.026
- You can't keep avoiding me.
- I'm not going back.

01:46.652 --> 01:48.319
We've built a life here.

01:48.320 --> 01:50.655
These are our children.

01:50.656 --> 01:52.615
Go back and ask Leila again, okay?

01:52.616 --> 01:54.785
- There has to be another way.
- It's not up to us.

01:57.162 --> 02:00.540
At least, this way,
I'll be here with them.

02:02.709 --> 02:04.461
But I'm their mother.

02:09.424 --> 02:10.883
Cut! Cut! Cut!

02:12.636 --> 02:14.553
- Go in close on Rainer.
- Going in tighter.

02:14.554 --> 02:16.263
Make it quick, folks.

02:16.264 --> 02:18.432
Still dry, Townsen?

02:18.433 --> 02:19.725
You couldn't shut off
the waterworks before.

02:19.726 --> 02:21.519
What gives, Paige?

02:21.520 --> 02:23.771
You know, Wyatt, you have
a real way with actors.

02:23.772 --> 02:25.147
You really speak our language.

02:25.148 --> 02:26.566
Get lost, Devon.

02:33.281 --> 02:34.740
What's the problem?

02:34.741 --> 02:37.743
I'm sorry, I, I got a
little distracted, I guess.

02:37.744 --> 02:39.412
A little?

02:39.413 --> 02:40.871
You're leaving your
children for God's sake.

02:40.872 --> 02:42.164
I need to see you moved.

02:42.165 --> 02:44.583
Whatever it is you're dealing with

02:44.584 --> 02:45.752
deal with it.

03:13.502 --> 03:15.503
- Hey.
- Hey, Jake. How's it going?

03:15.504 --> 03:17.422
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I'm still
working on the script.

03:17.423 --> 03:20.341
- What's up?
- Uh, did, did Cassie call you?

03:20.342 --> 03:22.135
Oh, she's fine. She's at her grandma's.

03:22.136 --> 03:24.137
- Wait, her Ohio grandma?
- San Diego.

03:24.138 --> 03:26.431
Hey, can I call you back?
I'm in the zone here.

03:26.432 --> 03:29.268
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah. Of course.

03:31.437 --> 03:32.437
- You okay?
- Great.

03:32.438 --> 03:34.023
Better get back to it, Jake.

03:35.274 --> 03:37.984
Hey, want to run some lines or...

03:37.985 --> 03:40.404
I know the lines, that's not my problem.

03:41.030 --> 03:42.114
So, what is it?

03:43.324 --> 03:46.701
If I tell you, I'll sound
like I'm in high school.

03:46.702 --> 03:48.703
Well, I skipped most of high school

03:48.704 --> 03:50.705
so, it'll all be new to me.

03:50.706 --> 03:53.416
Well, uh...

03:53.417 --> 03:54.876
Cassie and I got into a huge fight

03:54.877 --> 03:57.211
and she won't talk to me now.

03:57.212 --> 03:58.797
I can't stop thinking about it.

03:59.454 --> 04:00.806
It happens.

04:01.508 --> 04:02.717
But relax.

04:02.718 --> 04:05.428
You have a lot of other
emotional scenes in the movie.

04:05.429 --> 04:07.263
By the time you get to
those, you'll be ready.

04:07.264 --> 04:08.598
I hope so.

04:08.599 --> 04:10.808
If not, I've got a few
tricks up my sleeve.

04:10.809 --> 04:12.977
- Happy to share them with you.
- Tricks, huh?

04:12.978 --> 04:15.647
But not here, too risky.

04:15.648 --> 04:18.232
Okay. So when and where then?

04:18.233 --> 04:21.527
The caterers are serving
hammered chicken again.

04:21.528 --> 04:24.614
Or I know this great little
Italian place close by.

04:24.615 --> 04:26.950
I do love carbs.

04:26.951 --> 04:29.995
Well, I have a meeting,
but I can meet you later.

04:30.579 --> 04:32.163
Great.

04:40.506 --> 04:41.798
Hello.

04:41.799 --> 04:44.050
Jordan, I've got Curtis
from TCA on the line.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.635
Yeah. Put him on.

04:45.636 --> 04:47.011
I'm sure you slept
through the announcement

04:47.012 --> 04:49.222
but you snagged a
Golden Globe nomination.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.556
Can you believe it? Congrats.

04:50.557 --> 04:52.141
Listen, I've got a
million phone calls to make

04:52.142 --> 04:54.227
but I'll call you back later, okay?

04:54.228 --> 04:55.270
Thank you.

04:56.146 --> 04:57.189
Thank...

05:09.785 --> 05:11.369
Call Helene, my neck has been killing me

05:11.370 --> 05:12.453
since I got off the plane.

05:12.454 --> 05:13.788
Done, there's the breakfast meeting

05:13.789 --> 05:15.707
with the Weinstein's tomorrow.

05:15.708 --> 05:18.626
Oh, and we lost the Bradbury Building.

05:18.627 --> 05:19.627
Are you kidding me?

05:19.628 --> 05:20.753
Okay, we're supposed to shoot

05:20.754 --> 05:22.005
the New Year's scene there on Thursday.

05:22.006 --> 05:25.091
Um, Wednesday actually,
things got moved around.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.135
Okay, just get me
tomorrow's prelim call sheet

05:27.136 --> 05:29.595
and, uh, make sure to send a gift basket

05:29.596 --> 05:30.763
over for Jordan for his nomination.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.558
On it. Oh, and Xu Yifei's
entire family is coming to visit.

05:33.559 --> 05:36.561
She wants to know if they can
do the lot tour next Thursday.

05:36.562 --> 05:38.230
You backstabbing bitch.

05:39.606 --> 05:41.566
Didn't see you on my schedule, Ida.

05:41.567 --> 05:43.317
Sorry, she was next on my list...

05:43.318 --> 05:44.569
Just go.

05:44.570 --> 05:47.196
Ida, you were going to be my first call.

05:47.197 --> 05:48.531
Oh, well, now you can tell me

05:48.532 --> 05:50.324
to my face what the hell happened?

05:50.325 --> 05:52.160
Listen, I understand
why you're upset, but...

05:52.161 --> 05:55.038
Upset? Try furious, Nina.

05:55.039 --> 05:56.456
We had a deal.

05:56.457 --> 05:58.875
And then you go behind
my back and fire Tangey.

05:58.876 --> 06:00.126
After everything we've been through

06:00.127 --> 06:01.502
with these kids over the years?

06:01.503 --> 06:03.713
Can we please sit down
and talk about this?

06:03.714 --> 06:04.714
Let me explain.

06:04.715 --> 06:06.924
I'm fine right where I am. Thank you.

06:06.925 --> 06:09.510
The Chinese pulled their
distribution deal on "Locked."

06:09.511 --> 06:12.013
I fought for Tangey, and it didn't work.

06:12.014 --> 06:14.265
But we are going to
pay out her contract.

06:14.266 --> 06:17.810
I don't give a rat's ass
about China or the money.

06:17.811 --> 06:20.146
"Locked" was supposed to
launch Tangey's acting career.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.565
- You know that!
- She's still doing the music.

06:22.566 --> 06:24.317
You damn straight she
is, and you will be paying

06:24.318 --> 06:25.651
through the nose for that now.

06:25.652 --> 06:27.862
We can discuss possible
points on the back end, or...

06:27.863 --> 06:29.655
I'm done dealing with you, Nina.

06:29.656 --> 06:31.949
You'll be hearing from our attorneys.

06:36.538 --> 06:37.915
Okay, bye, Mike.

06:39.291 --> 06:42.627
Mike got held up, maybe we
should reschedule this meeting.

06:42.628 --> 06:45.630
No. I-I wanna talk about this now.

06:45.631 --> 06:47.131
Oh. Okay.

06:47.132 --> 06:48.758
What's going on?

06:48.759 --> 06:50.301
I don't think that we need to bring

06:50.302 --> 06:51.719
another writer on "No Place Like You."

06:51.720 --> 06:54.555
It's not "Another writer." It's
Kevin O'Hare. He's a Puli...

06:54.556 --> 06:57.850
Pulitzer Prize winning
playwright. I know.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.477
But you didn't even consult with me

06:59.478 --> 07:01.103
and I'm a producer on this project.

07:01.104 --> 07:02.688
Then you should be thrilled.

07:02.689 --> 07:05.526
Kevin's got real heat
coming off his Broadway hit.

07:09.363 --> 07:11.030
What about Jake?

07:11.031 --> 07:13.616
He's been working his
butt off on our notes.

07:13.617 --> 07:15.326
You couldn't wait for his rewrite?

07:15.327 --> 07:19.372
Newcastle bought Jake's script
based on concept, not execution.

07:19.373 --> 07:20.998
You're gonna love Kevin,
he's coming in tomorrow

07:20.999 --> 07:22.917
to pitch us his take.

07:22.918 --> 07:25.002
Well, if we're gonna have two drafts

07:25.003 --> 07:26.963
can you at least
consider Jake's version?

07:26.964 --> 07:28.589
Maybe we could pick the best script.

07:28.590 --> 07:30.758
That's not the way it works, Alexis.

07:30.759 --> 07:33.762
I'm sorry, but this decision
is above your pay grade.

07:37.099 --> 07:39.726
When are you guys letting
Jake know he's off the project?

07:40.686 --> 07:42.186
Actually, Mike and I thought

07:42.187 --> 07:44.189
it would be best coming from you.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.804
So you're the guy who's
been threatening my mom?

08:16.805 --> 08:19.473
Don Oxley. I don't make threats.

08:19.474 --> 08:22.226
If someone owes me money,
I get paid no matter what.

08:22.227 --> 08:24.770
You must know that, otherwise
you wouldn't be here.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.857
Are you ready to settle up?

08:27.858 --> 08:30.651
- Brandy doesn't have that...
- Then you're wasting my time.

08:30.652 --> 08:33.447
Unless you came to tell me
you're assuming her debts?

08:35.657 --> 08:37.741
Will you leave my mom alone?

08:37.743 --> 08:39.284
If we're dealing with you,
we won't have any issues

08:39.285 --> 08:41.288
with your mom, now, will we?

08:44.791 --> 08:47.376
Okay. Yes, I'll assume her debts.

08:47.377 --> 08:49.962
Then I'll expect you
here on Friday, same time

08:49.963 --> 08:51.965
so we can resolve the matter.

09:20.786 --> 09:22.119
Oh, hey, you wouldn't happen to know

09:22.120 --> 09:23.829
where, uh, Rainer is, would you?

09:23.830 --> 09:25.873
Uh, he just left, like, a second ago.

09:25.874 --> 09:27.959
Okay. Nice.

09:27.960 --> 09:31.003
Um, good luck at your Newcastle meeting.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.298
Oh, how, uh... How did
you know about that?

09:34.299 --> 09:36.968
- I know everything.
- Oh, of course you do.

09:36.969 --> 09:39.637
You know, my agents have
been really hounding me

09:39.638 --> 09:41.806
about what I'm gonna
take after "Locked," so...

09:41.807 --> 09:43.516
Dance with whoever you want.

09:43.517 --> 09:46.520
Just don't forget, uh, who
brought you to the party.

10:00.492 --> 10:02.285
Hey. Nice one.

10:02.286 --> 10:05.080
Hey, Steve, Wyatt needs
you at video village.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.529
- Hey.
- Take it.

10:09.751 --> 10:12.920
Oh. You've got a good arm.

10:12.921 --> 10:14.922
Oh, this old man was
once the star quarterback

10:14.923 --> 10:16.508
at West Valley High.

10:17.301 --> 10:18.719
You play sports?

10:20.095 --> 10:22.179
Nah, didn't attend a regular school

10:22.180 --> 10:24.056
long enough to be on the team.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.058
Well, but you surf.

10:26.059 --> 10:27.685
See, you got a thruster.

10:27.686 --> 10:29.895
- You're a surfer too?
- Yeah.

10:29.896 --> 10:32.315
Since I was about your age.

10:32.316 --> 10:35.693
I kinda prefer a quad.
Like the way it rides.

10:35.694 --> 10:37.820
Loose and fast.

10:37.821 --> 10:39.530
Where do you hit the waves?

10:39.531 --> 10:41.533
I have a house in Broad Beach.

10:43.910 --> 10:45.036
So, Trancas Point?

10:45.037 --> 10:46.620
- Yes.
- Cool.

10:46.621 --> 10:48.664
Hey, there's a big south
at Little Dume tomorrow

10:48.665 --> 10:50.041
right in front of my house.

10:50.042 --> 10:52.043
- You in?
- I'm in.

10:53.462 --> 10:55.838
- Great.
- Alright. Watch out.

10:55.839 --> 10:57.882
I'm giving this one the
Mills signature spiral.

10:57.883 --> 10:59.468
Go up. Here you go, baby!

11:00.594 --> 11:02.094
Oh! Boom!

11:09.436 --> 11:11.103
So, your agents tell
me you're interested

11:11.104 --> 11:12.897
in our Margaret Sanger biopic.

11:12.898 --> 11:14.148
I am. I-I love her.

11:14.149 --> 11:16.025
She's progressive and fearless.

11:16.026 --> 11:18.069
I also love how she really fought

11:18.070 --> 11:19.487
for women's reproductive rights

11:19.488 --> 11:22.073
during a time when it was just so taboo.

11:22.074 --> 11:24.325
- You'd make a great Margaret.
- Thank you.

11:24.326 --> 11:25.701
I just wish you would've told us sooner.

11:25.702 --> 11:27.119
We're out to a few
other actresses already.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.081
Oh! Okay, well, I still love the role.

11:30.082 --> 11:31.332
We'll see how it all plays out.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.750
But, since you're here, let me tell you

11:32.751 --> 11:34.210
about some of our other projects.

11:34.211 --> 11:36.796
We've got Clive
Barker's "Damnation Game"

11:36.797 --> 11:38.381
with Christophe Arnold directing.

11:38.382 --> 11:39.965
- Are you a horror fan?
- Yeah. Sure.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.093
I mean, who doesn't
love a good scary movie?

11:42.094 --> 11:43.844
Then we'll send you the script.

11:43.845 --> 11:47.014
And you might also
like our latest project

11:47.015 --> 11:48.057
"No Place Like You."

11:48.058 --> 11:50.101
This is a beautiful, little dramedy

11:50.102 --> 11:52.228
set in Detroit in the 1950s

11:52.229 --> 11:54.980
since you are interested
in period pieces.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.149
Yeah, I'd be so
interested in reading this.

11:57.150 --> 11:59.193
Um, I hear it's pretty great.

11:59.194 --> 12:01.112
Do you mind if I just
take this home with me?

12:01.113 --> 12:02.738
Uh, not yet, we bought that

12:02.739 --> 12:04.615
from some baby writer, a college kid.

12:04.616 --> 12:07.076
Honestly, we just really love the story.

12:07.077 --> 12:10.663
But good news, we locked
in playwright Kevin O'Hare

12:10.664 --> 12:12.082
to do the rewrite.

12:13.375 --> 12:15.918
That's great. How... um...

12:15.919 --> 12:18.295
Uh, what about the original writer?

12:18.296 --> 12:20.131
Jake Salt?

12:20.132 --> 12:22.133
O'Hare won the Pulitzer

12:22.134 --> 12:24.176
and his take on the
story is spectacular.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.137
We'll get it to you
as soon as it's done.

12:26.138 --> 12:27.681
Right. Right. Of course.

12:34.601 --> 12:36.060
Come on, Cassie.

12:36.061 --> 12:37.687
Please, will you pick
up the phone already?

12:37.688 --> 12:39.190
It's about Jake. I just found...

12:39.215 --> 12:41.089
If you're satisfied with your message,

12:41.114 --> 12:42.734
press one now.

12:42.735 --> 12:45.111
_

13:14.892 --> 13:16.893
Congrats on the big news this morning.

13:16.895 --> 13:20.355
- Thanks.
- You don't sound very excited.

13:20.356 --> 13:23.860
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, just...

13:25.156 --> 13:27.695
You didn't happen to say anything
to Barrett Hopper about me, did you?

13:27.696 --> 13:30.531
Why on earth would I talk
to that troll about you?

13:30.532 --> 13:33.576
I don't know, but he's
just been on my ass lately.

13:33.577 --> 13:35.953
I thought maybe you
wanted to get back at me.

13:35.955 --> 13:38.039
- Back at you?
- Over Tangey.

13:38.040 --> 13:39.499
Did you let her go because of us?

13:39.500 --> 13:41.000
Because I couldn't bear that.

13:41.001 --> 13:43.187
Wait. Do you think...

13:43.212 --> 13:46.065
- That's not why we let her go.
- What happened?

13:46.136 --> 13:49.139
Our investors were about to
pull out. We had to negotiate.

13:49.806 --> 13:51.807
That's all it was.

13:51.808 --> 13:54.894
But don't worry, I'm working
on a solution to get her back.

13:56.396 --> 13:57.605
Hope so.

13:58.606 --> 14:00.191
Her scenes are really good.

14:01.359 --> 14:03.110
Are you okay?

14:03.111 --> 14:05.487
Is there something else
you wanna talk about?

14:05.488 --> 14:07.197
More Brandy drama.

14:07.198 --> 14:09.325
I don't wanna bother you with it.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.994
Who else can you confide in?

14:13.330 --> 14:16.332
After Aidan died, she
owed a lot of money.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.876
- And now it's on me.
- Well, that sounds serious.

14:18.877 --> 14:20.252
Wouldn't be so bad.

14:20.253 --> 14:23.255
But I haven't got paid for "Locked" yet.

14:23.256 --> 14:25.424
Rainer wanted to float me, but
that just didn't seem right.

14:25.425 --> 14:28.135
What if I could get you
an advance on your fee?

14:28.136 --> 14:30.889
Don't answer that. I'm
gonna take care of it.

14:32.599 --> 14:34.767
I'd never do anything
to hurt you, Jordan.

14:34.768 --> 14:37.187
You mean more to me
than you'll ever know.

14:48.323 --> 14:49.615
Did Mike and Orly set that meeting?

14:49.616 --> 14:52.201
Yeah, uh, it's tomorrow,
but I don't think

14:52.202 --> 14:55.162
that we'll need you, it's just
like production stuff, so...

14:55.163 --> 14:57.331
But I know production stuff, remember?

14:57.332 --> 14:59.249
Because I can miss my biology class.

14:59.250 --> 15:01.377
Jake, I need to talk
to you about something.

15:01.378 --> 15:02.961
Wait. There's something
I wanna show you first.

15:02.962 --> 15:04.380
So I haven't been sleeping much

15:04.381 --> 15:07.592
so I pulled a few
all-nighters, and, um...

15:09.135 --> 15:11.512
You're finished with the draft already?

15:11.513 --> 15:14.807
- Okay. So, about the scripts...
- Wait, one more thing.

15:14.808 --> 15:16.393
Can I take you out to Nobu this weekend?

15:17.310 --> 15:18.852
But that's so expensive.

15:18.853 --> 15:21.230
I'm about to get my first check.

15:21.231 --> 15:23.899
Yeah, but, Jake, it's
like an indie movie, so...

15:23.900 --> 15:25.693
I want to. Okay?

15:26.236 --> 15:27.862
Please, let me.

15:30.365 --> 15:32.199
Good.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.618
Now, what did you want to say?

15:36.037 --> 15:37.247
Nothing.

15:38.623 --> 15:40.834
Just that I love Nobu.

15:43.711 --> 15:46.422
Yo, Lexie.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.090
Small world! Heh.

15:48.091 --> 15:49.883
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:49.884 --> 15:52.803
- Uh, how's the script?
- It's, it's great.

15:52.804 --> 15:55.180
Alexis is producing the
hell out of this movie.

15:55.181 --> 15:57.224
We're fast-tracked at Newcastle.

15:57.225 --> 15:58.600
Congratulations.

15:58.601 --> 16:00.477
That's so great.

16:00.478 --> 16:02.354
Who knew a year ago,
I-I'd be writing "Fade In"

16:02.355 --> 16:03.772
at the CMU library?

16:03.773 --> 16:05.358
We'd be green-light a year later.

16:07.110 --> 16:10.280
Yeah, you know it's amazing
how quickly things can change.

16:13.408 --> 16:15.075
Looks like our table's ready

16:15.076 --> 16:17.703
so we're gonna... go eat.

16:17.704 --> 16:19.122
See you guys.

16:21.416 --> 16:22.584
Thank you.

16:32.343 --> 16:34.261
- You wanna go somewhere else?
- Hm?

16:34.262 --> 16:35.929
Is this weird for you? Them?

16:35.930 --> 16:37.265
Uh, no.

16:39.309 --> 16:41.143
No, what's weird is

16:41.144 --> 16:43.729
I had a meeting today at Newcastle

16:43.730 --> 16:46.690
and they told me they're
firing Jake off his movie.

16:46.691 --> 16:48.275
I'm pretty sure he doesn't know.

16:48.276 --> 16:51.445
I mean, I should tell him
right? Should I tell him?

16:51.446 --> 16:52.613
No. Don't.

16:52.614 --> 16:55.991
- Don't tell him?
- That's Mike Tanen's job.

16:55.992 --> 16:57.951
Or Alexis', not yours.

16:57.952 --> 17:01.038
Well, clearly she hasn't said anything.

17:01.039 --> 17:02.456
Maybe she doesn't know yet either.

17:02.457 --> 17:03.790
She doesn't look like
someone who's about

17:03.791 --> 17:05.709
to knife her boyfriend in the back.

17:05.710 --> 17:07.877
But then, you're talking about Alexis.

17:07.878 --> 17:10.297
Oh, my God, this is so terrible.

17:10.298 --> 17:12.215
What am I gonna do?

17:12.217 --> 17:14.384
If there's one thing I've learned

17:14.385 --> 17:17.347
it's keep business
and personal separate.

17:18.431 --> 17:20.557
So, in this case, do nothing.

17:20.558 --> 17:22.476
Let the producers handle it.

17:22.477 --> 17:23.727
I don't understand, how do you deal with

17:23.728 --> 17:26.563
how cut-throat people are in this town?

17:26.564 --> 17:29.233
Okay, here's a more positive
way of looking at it.

17:29.234 --> 17:31.527
It's like a roller coaster.
You can't control it.

17:31.528 --> 17:32.736
You just got to find a way to hang on

17:32.737 --> 17:36.156
and enjoy the thrill of the ride.

17:36.157 --> 17:38.993
It's not so bad when you
have someone to share it with.

17:43.373 --> 17:46.376
Keeping business and
personal separate, huh?

17:47.126 --> 17:48.419
Could've fooled me.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.509
Let's get the techno crane set up.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.307
Congratulations.

18:43.308 --> 18:45.976
We are all so proud of you, Jordan.

18:45.977 --> 18:47.603
Thanks.

18:47.604 --> 18:48.896
I'm still in shock.

18:48.897 --> 18:50.355
Well, you deserve it.

18:50.356 --> 18:52.649
Which one of these
gift baskets is for me?

18:52.650 --> 18:55.027
- The biggest one, I hope.
- Of course.

18:55.028 --> 18:57.529
- Thank you.
- Looks like Christmas in here.

18:57.530 --> 19:00.365
That's what happens when
you're a Golden Globe nominee.

19:00.366 --> 19:02.409
Uh, I'll catch you both later.

19:02.410 --> 19:05.078
- Got to hit the gym.
- Later, buddy.

19:05.079 --> 19:07.539
- How was the rest of your trip?
- Exhausting.

19:07.540 --> 19:10.126
And I have jet lag, so I'll
probably be up all night.

19:11.252 --> 19:12.377
Is that a new surfboard?

19:12.378 --> 19:13.921
No. Alan dropped off his board.

19:13.922 --> 19:15.255
We were surfing in the morning.

19:15.256 --> 19:16.673
Alan? Alan who?

19:16.674 --> 19:19.509
You know, Alan-Alan. Your boss.

19:19.510 --> 19:21.678
Why are you surfing with Alan Mills?

19:21.679 --> 19:23.680
He was hanging on set all
day, we got to talking...

19:23.681 --> 19:25.099
Why was he on set?

19:26.434 --> 19:29.269
Maybe because he's
the head of the studio.

19:29.270 --> 19:31.605
What? Did you two have it
out in China or something?

19:31.606 --> 19:33.482
Not at all. I...

19:33.483 --> 19:35.233
Alan doesn't go to set.

19:35.234 --> 19:37.152
So, I'm just making sure that

19:37.153 --> 19:39.529
they're no fires that I wasn't aware of.

19:39.530 --> 19:41.615
Nope. He's a cool guy.

19:41.616 --> 19:43.284
We actually have a lot in common.

19:45.495 --> 19:48.747
- Is everything okay?
- No.

19:48.748 --> 19:51.750
Solving one problem in China
has created five more here.

19:51.751 --> 19:54.545
Ida's giving me hell over Tangey
losing her role in "Locked."

19:56.255 --> 19:58.382
Can't you shoot two versions?

19:58.383 --> 20:00.592
One with Tangey and one with Xu Yifei?

20:00.593 --> 20:02.010
Well, that would be expensive.

20:02.011 --> 20:03.596
Not as much as a lawsuit.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.642
- Actually...
- What?

20:09.060 --> 20:12.270
- I think it's brilliant.
- Really?

20:12.271 --> 20:14.982
It's the one solution that
will make everybody happy.

20:14.983 --> 20:16.900
- Mmm.
- Look at you!

20:16.901 --> 20:18.318
Producing is in your blood.

20:19.696 --> 20:20.822
Wow.

20:30.081 --> 20:31.248
Jake...

20:31.249 --> 20:32.667
Alexis?

20:33.835 --> 20:35.752
What? Um, where's Jake?

20:35.753 --> 20:37.713
What are you, what are you doing here?

20:37.714 --> 20:39.716
We're working. He's in the bathroom.

20:40.758 --> 20:41.926
Want some?

20:43.720 --> 20:45.053
No.

20:45.054 --> 20:48.640
So, I had a meeting at Newcastle today.

20:48.641 --> 20:52.153
Did you know Jake was being
replaced on his own film?

20:52.937 --> 20:55.814
So-so you did know. Well,
did you tell him yet?

20:55.815 --> 20:58.525
Okay. You don't understand
what's happening.

20:58.526 --> 21:00.193
What I do understand

21:00.194 --> 21:01.820
is that Jake has been glued

21:01.821 --> 21:04.614
to his desk, 24/7, busting his ass

21:04.615 --> 21:06.742
on a rewrite that nobody wants.

21:06.743 --> 21:08.493
Okay. Well, the rewrite
is in his contract.

21:08.494 --> 21:09.619
He's still getting paid for it.

21:09.620 --> 21:12.289
Stop! Stop trying to spin this.

21:12.290 --> 21:15.625
That is my best friend over there...

21:15.626 --> 21:17.002
that's about to have one of the most

21:17.003 --> 21:19.087
disappointing moments of his life.

21:19.088 --> 21:21.256
All because you sold him out.

21:21.257 --> 21:23.633
Whoa! This is not my fault.

21:23.634 --> 21:25.427
Well, why does everyone
assume that if it's evil

21:25.428 --> 21:27.846
and if it's happening to
Hollywood, it's all me?

21:27.847 --> 21:31.767
Alexis, Jake deserves to know the truth.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.769
If you don't tell him tonight, I will.

21:33.770 --> 21:37.606
Okay, I'm going to tell
him, okay? It's just, it's...

21:37.607 --> 21:40.650
It's not easy telling someone
that they've been fired.

21:40.651 --> 21:42.028
I've been fired?

21:44.614 --> 21:46.032
Alexis...

21:49.660 --> 21:53.081
I'm, I'm gonna give you guys a moment.

22:00.838 --> 22:02.465
I'm sorry.

22:03.716 --> 22:06.051
- I really am.
- How long have you known?

22:06.052 --> 22:08.762
Since this morning, but I kept
trying to bring it up to you...

22:08.763 --> 22:10.306
You should've tried harder.

22:11.766 --> 22:14.768
Okay, I-I know that you're upset.

22:14.769 --> 22:17.771
And I'm sorry, but I-I tried, Jake.

22:17.772 --> 22:19.773
There wasn't anything that I could do.

22:19.774 --> 22:23.276
It's normal for feature films
to go through multiple writers

22:23.277 --> 22:24.861
dozens sometimes.

22:24.862 --> 22:26.404
It's part of the process.

22:26.405 --> 22:27.739
And even if you're getting rewritten

22:27.740 --> 22:28.990
you're probably still gonna get credit.

22:28.991 --> 22:30.660
Probably?

22:31.702 --> 22:33.495
Wow.

22:33.496 --> 22:35.665
Thanks a lot. I feel much better.

22:36.707 --> 22:38.041
It's not that bad.

22:38.042 --> 22:40.627
You sold a script. You're getting paid.

22:40.628 --> 22:42.379
Don't you get it?

22:42.380 --> 22:44.757
This story is personal to me.

22:46.300 --> 22:48.051
You think I'm not smart
enough to know this is

22:48.052 --> 22:51.763
your big unrequited
love story with Paige?

22:51.764 --> 22:52.973
You can't fool me just because

22:52.974 --> 22:55.643
you're set in Detroit in the 1950s.

22:59.188 --> 23:00.356
Jake...

23:01.232 --> 23:04.317
Hey, look...

23:04.318 --> 23:07.154
We'll go to Nobu, a-and, and sip sake

23:07.155 --> 23:08.905
and talk about your next idea

23:08.906 --> 23:10.907
and it'll be o-okay.

23:10.908 --> 23:12.076
Forget it.

23:12.910 --> 23:14.328
We're done.

23:23.629 --> 23:25.755
Jake...

23:25.756 --> 23:27.841
I care about you...

23:27.842 --> 23:29.468
a lot.

23:59.684 --> 24:01.102
You okay?

24:02.854 --> 24:04.230
Not really.

24:04.605 --> 24:06.440
I'm sorry.

24:06.441 --> 24:07.899
How did you find out about this?

24:07.900 --> 24:11.486
I had a general meeting
today with Newcastle

24:11.487 --> 24:13.530
and I tried to call you after, but...

24:13.531 --> 24:15.407
Great.

24:15.408 --> 24:16.658
When I was working.

24:16.659 --> 24:19.662
I feel like such an idiot.

24:21.164 --> 24:23.790
I trusted her. I-I trusted them.

24:23.791 --> 24:25.417
And the whole time, they were telling me

24:25.418 --> 24:26.460
what I wanted to hear

24:26.461 --> 24:28.045
so I would...

24:29.255 --> 24:30.881
hand it over.

24:30.882 --> 24:33.468
Hey, you are not an idiot, Jake.

24:34.469 --> 24:36.344
You're beyond talented.

24:36.345 --> 24:39.014
It is not your fault
they screwed you over.

24:39.015 --> 24:40.391
It's just...

24:41.517 --> 24:43.936
just so unfair.

24:45.521 --> 24:47.899
This is how it works, I guess.

24:50.318 --> 24:53.570
What if... there was a way

24:53.571 --> 24:55.572
to get your script back?

24:55.573 --> 24:57.866
I mean, they haven't
paid you for it, right?

24:57.867 --> 25:00.328
What if you...

25:00.953 --> 25:02.537
you do a Kickstarter?

25:02.538 --> 25:03.622
Yeah.

25:03.623 --> 25:05.707
You, me, Cassie. I mean, we've...

25:05.708 --> 25:08.835
We've always wanted to
make a-a movie one summer.

25:08.836 --> 25:10.545
Yeah, I-I could direct the thing myself.

25:10.546 --> 25:12.422
Just tell them the deal is off.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.801
I can't do that right now, but, um...

25:16.093 --> 25:17.844
But there's a meeting tomorrow morning.

25:17.845 --> 25:21.015
Go to that meeting and...

25:24.352 --> 25:26.354
Go get your movie back.

25:28.481 --> 25:29.773
Thank you.

25:29.774 --> 25:31.066
Of course.

25:50.737 --> 25:53.252
Ida. She's in a meeting.

25:53.277 --> 25:55.820
So, should I call my attorney?

25:55.845 --> 25:59.182
Or did you figure out how to get
Tangey back where she belongs?

25:59.190 --> 26:00.816
So sorry, Nina. I tried to stop her.

26:00.817 --> 26:02.567
- Try harder next time.
- I did, but she...

26:02.568 --> 26:03.736
Just go.

26:05.287 --> 26:06.945
Now, put your phone away.

26:07.342 --> 26:10.004
I knew I could count on you.

26:10.596 --> 26:14.140
Oh, I'm just finalizing
the details now, but...

26:14.141 --> 26:15.766
The new plan is to shoot two versions

26:15.767 --> 26:17.268
of the "Time Sorceress."

26:17.269 --> 26:19.353
One for the American market
and one for the Chinese.

26:19.354 --> 26:22.315
- So, Tangey...
- Is our American "Leila."

26:22.316 --> 26:24.066
- She's back in "Locked."
- Brilliant!

26:24.067 --> 26:27.653
- I will call her right now.
- Not so fast.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.072
- I have one condition.
- Of course you do.

26:30.073 --> 26:32.617
You tipped Barrett Hopper
off about Brandy Michaels

26:32.618 --> 26:34.076
and now he's harassing Jordan.

26:34.077 --> 26:35.620
Why do you care?

26:35.621 --> 26:37.997
You're the one who told me
about Brandy in the first place.

26:37.998 --> 26:39.457
So, what if Barrett knows?

26:39.458 --> 26:41.709
I wanted the truth to break
up Jordan and Tangey, but...

26:41.710 --> 26:43.711
But they're not together anymore.

26:43.712 --> 26:46.130
So call off your dog, or
you and I are gonna have

26:46.131 --> 26:49.091
much bigger problems than
keeping your daughter employed.

26:49.092 --> 26:50.927
I can lose the additional
financing to shoot

26:50.928 --> 26:54.431
the two versions just
as easily as I found it.

26:55.265 --> 26:58.561
Fine. You have a deal.

27:04.483 --> 27:06.525
And then Virginia drives off the lot

27:06.526 --> 27:08.694
in the very car Frank's just finished

27:08.695 --> 27:10.529
putting the shiniest chrome rims on.

27:10.530 --> 27:12.615
In that moment

27:12.616 --> 27:16.411
Frank realizes he'd give up
the entire factory for her.

27:17.496 --> 27:19.080
Jake?

27:19.081 --> 27:21.582
- You must be the new writer?
- Yeah.

27:21.583 --> 27:23.125
Kevin O' Hare.

27:23.126 --> 27:25.754
Maybe you can take Kevin to your
office, Orly, we need a moment.

27:30.092 --> 27:31.467
I'm sure Alexis told you

27:31.468 --> 27:33.219
we decided to go in a new direction.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.637
We think bringing in a fresh vision

27:34.638 --> 27:35.930
will help elevate the material.

27:35.931 --> 27:37.807
If you want to tell a
different story, go ahead

27:37.808 --> 27:39.642
but don't screw up mine.

27:39.643 --> 27:40.726
I want my script back.

27:40.727 --> 27:42.895
Well, I'm sorry, kid, but
we own the property now.

27:42.896 --> 27:44.772
Now, you haven't paid me a dime yet.

27:44.773 --> 27:46.732
So, give me my script back.

27:46.733 --> 27:48.567
The deal's already closed.

27:48.568 --> 27:50.236
Mike...

27:50.237 --> 27:52.405
I think we can work something out.

27:52.406 --> 27:53.781
Well, if you'd like, I
can have one of my lawyers

27:53.782 --> 27:56.701
come and clarify the
details for the both of you.

27:56.702 --> 27:59.287
It's all in the contract you signed.

28:02.624 --> 28:04.668
How do you sleep at night?

28:21.476 --> 28:25.230
Well, I'd say nice surprise,
but that would be a lie.

28:27.566 --> 28:30.317
I drove an hour to get here.

28:30.318 --> 28:32.027
The least you could
do is offer me a drink.

28:32.028 --> 28:33.654
This is either bad news about "Locked"

28:33.655 --> 28:37.116
or a social visit, I'm
not sure which is worse.

28:37.117 --> 28:41.537
Oh, I'm here because I
think Rainer is my son.

28:44.040 --> 28:46.500
Don't flatter yourself,
Alan. That's ridiculous.

28:46.501 --> 28:48.210
Well, first, it was the motion sickness.

28:48.211 --> 28:51.088
Then finding out he's 23, not 21.

28:51.089 --> 28:54.341
I saw his birth certificate.
"Father Unknown?"

28:54.342 --> 28:56.719
His father's identity
is none of your business.

28:56.720 --> 28:59.931
You can tell me the truth now
or I'll find out in a few weeks.

29:01.683 --> 29:06.062
I already sent out our hair
samples for DNA testing.

29:11.735 --> 29:13.778
So I'm right?

29:13.779 --> 29:14.946
'It's true?'

29:16.740 --> 29:17.949
Yes.

29:21.203 --> 29:23.954
How could you deny him
a chance to know his dad?

29:23.955 --> 29:26.248
Are you that selfish?

29:26.249 --> 29:28.876
Well, you kept promising
to leave your wife.

29:28.877 --> 29:31.212
And in case you forgot,
that never happened.

29:31.213 --> 29:33.506
Instead you fired me,
and then two weeks later

29:33.507 --> 29:35.216
I found out I was pregnant.

29:35.217 --> 29:37.760
So don't talk to me about being selfish.

29:37.761 --> 29:39.887
You still should've told me.

29:39.888 --> 29:41.222
You never even gave me a chance.

29:41.223 --> 29:43.808
I didn't choose to be a single mother.

29:43.809 --> 29:45.893
Nobody chooses that.

29:45.894 --> 29:48.229
But Rainer is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

29:48.230 --> 29:50.397
And I wasn't the monster
you made me out to be.

29:50.398 --> 29:52.274
I had a right to know.

29:52.275 --> 29:54.860
You didn't want kids back then,
and you don't have them now.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.196
That doesn't mean he wouldn't
have been the best thing

29:57.197 --> 29:59.199
that ever happened to me, too.

30:03.829 --> 30:05.329
Rainer can't find out.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.332
You don't get to make that decision.

30:08.750 --> 30:10.209
He's my son!

30:10.210 --> 30:13.295
I've missed 23 years.

30:13.296 --> 30:15.465
I'm not waiting another minute.

30:16.341 --> 30:19.426
No, okay! Alan! I-I will tell him.

30:19.427 --> 30:22.721
Just let me be the
one to break the news.

30:22.722 --> 30:24.932
I have to go to New York
tomorrow to secure locations.

30:24.933 --> 30:26.559
I...

30:26.560 --> 30:30.104
Just give me a few days to
work out what I'm gonna say.

30:30.105 --> 30:31.898
I will tell him when I get home.

30:32.899 --> 30:34.526
I promise.

30:36.027 --> 30:38.654
I'll have to think about that.

30:57.213 --> 30:59.089
We missed you last night. How did it go?

30:59.090 --> 31:02.300
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Hey, what's wrong? Talk to me.

31:02.301 --> 31:04.010
Some guy was pitching his version

31:04.011 --> 31:05.387
of my script when I went down there.

31:05.388 --> 31:07.472
I-I made a complete ass of myself.

31:07.473 --> 31:08.973
I mean, they threatened lawyers.

31:08.974 --> 31:10.809
So, no, I didn't get my script back.

31:10.810 --> 31:12.435
And once word gets out about this

31:12.436 --> 31:13.812
I'll never work in this town again.

31:13.813 --> 31:17.233
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Jake. I...

31:18.901 --> 31:20.402
I gave you really bad advice. I-I...

31:20.403 --> 31:22.278
Paige, come on. This isn't your fault.

31:22.279 --> 31:25.156
Well, screw 'em, okay?
You'll write another one.

31:25.157 --> 31:26.783
I-I don't feel much like writing.

31:26.784 --> 31:29.494
Maybe you can take your
rewrite money and you know

31:29.495 --> 31:30.954
pour it into your thesis film.

31:30.955 --> 31:33.373
Whatever I need to be learning

31:33.374 --> 31:35.041
I'm not learning in film school.

31:35.042 --> 31:37.043
You're being way too hard on yourself.

31:37.044 --> 31:38.796
- Am I?
- Yes.

31:40.381 --> 31:43.716
I got an interview to PA
on a Richard Linklater film.

31:43.717 --> 31:46.845
Uh, maybe I just need to get
out of here and learn something.

31:46.846 --> 31:50.223
- Y-you can't just drop out.
- Why not?

31:50.224 --> 31:52.308
Richard Linklater never
went to film school.

31:52.309 --> 31:55.145
Uh, John Hughes, Oliver Stone.

31:55.146 --> 31:57.272
I mean, Woody Allen. They made movies.

31:57.273 --> 31:59.357
Something I'm not doing in school.

31:59.358 --> 32:01.359
- For how long?
- Three months.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.069
Uh, maybe longer, if
I work through post.

32:03.070 --> 32:05.447
Look, I don't know. Maybe
I'll like it more in Austin.

32:05.448 --> 32:07.907
Austin, Texas?

32:07.908 --> 32:09.909
No, no. Jake, come-come on.

32:09.910 --> 32:12.245
Y-you can't just give up on Hollywood.

32:12.246 --> 32:14.289
You're still a film student.

32:14.290 --> 32:15.707
Things are gonna get better for you.

32:15.708 --> 32:18.711
I mean, they're not really that bad.

32:20.379 --> 32:22.005
You're right.

32:22.006 --> 32:24.467
Hey, I'm still learning.

32:25.634 --> 32:28.637
Which is exactly why
I want to go to Texas.

32:30.556 --> 32:31.931
Jake, I really...

32:31.932 --> 32:34.059
Uh, sorry.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.520
I, I have to go right now

32:37.521 --> 32:39.814
or I'm gonna be really late to set.

32:39.815 --> 32:43.485
I'm sorry. But I'm gonna
order us Pad Thai later.

32:43.486 --> 32:45.069
I'll pick it up on the way home.

32:45.070 --> 32:47.071
And you have to wait
for me until I get home

32:47.072 --> 32:48.364
to make any decisions, okay?

32:48.365 --> 32:51.243
We're gonna talk this out. Okay?

33:01.170 --> 33:02.504
How was the breakfast with Weinstein's?

33:02.505 --> 33:04.881
Well, I wouldn't know because
you gave me the wrong time.

33:04.882 --> 33:06.508
And Hilary at New Line had no idea

33:06.509 --> 33:08.259
what I was talking about
on our conference call

33:08.260 --> 33:10.553
because she never received the package.

33:10.554 --> 33:12.013
But I sent it, I sw...

33:12.014 --> 33:13.681
You are never going
to be a good executive

33:13.682 --> 33:16.559
if you can't be a competent assistant.

33:16.560 --> 33:17.728
You're fired.

33:19.522 --> 33:22.482
I know I screwed up,
Nina. And I'm sorry.

33:22.483 --> 33:25.610
Oh, by the way, I got the
Bradbury Building back.

33:25.611 --> 33:27.070
I spoke to the LA Film Commission.

33:27.071 --> 33:29.906
They were instrumental
in working things out.

33:29.907 --> 33:31.283
We can shoot there on Friday.

33:32.910 --> 33:34.744
Well, good work, Eva.

33:34.745 --> 33:37.413
A problem solver is exactly
the kind of person I need.

33:37.414 --> 33:40.584
In fact, keep it up, and you
might even get yourself a raise.

33:46.840 --> 33:48.384
Come in.

33:49.593 --> 33:52.136
Chocolate glazed or sprinkles?

33:52.137 --> 33:54.722
Whatever will help me get
through this emotional scene.

33:54.723 --> 33:57.142
I hear Meryl Streep with
sprinkles all the way.

33:59.311 --> 34:00.812
Thank you.

34:00.813 --> 34:02.439
You still worried about it?

34:03.566 --> 34:07.193
Yeah, still very distracted,
and no word from Cassie.

34:07.194 --> 34:08.485
What about Jake?

34:08.487 --> 34:11.907
Yeah, he knows. It was... pretty awful.

34:12.908 --> 34:15.868
And I know now I'm supposed to...

34:15.869 --> 34:17.954
you know, get my head into this

34:17.955 --> 34:21.208
but I'm just not sure I can.

34:22.376 --> 34:24.210
We'll do it.

34:24.210 --> 34:26.545
- As August and Noah.
- I know. I just...

34:26.547 --> 34:28.547
Crying's never been a
problem for me before.

34:28.549 --> 34:31.467
And here I have this heartbreaking scene

34:31.467 --> 34:35.444
right in front of me and... nothing.

34:36.181 --> 34:39.183
So, when am I gonna learn
these tricks of yours, huh?

34:39.184 --> 34:41.643
The truth is, there are no tricks.

34:41.645 --> 34:43.521
Acting's a lot of hard work.

34:43.522 --> 34:45.733
I focus on a sad memory.

34:47.025 --> 34:48.027
Like...

34:49.027 --> 34:51.487
the reason why I am sober.

34:51.487 --> 34:53.197
When I was on "Backsplash"

34:53.197 --> 34:55.867
my mom was off on location

34:55.868 --> 34:58.202
a lot and...

34:58.203 --> 34:59.829
I wound up at parties drinking

34:59.830 --> 35:02.291
when I was too young to
know how to handle it.

35:03.959 --> 35:07.379
I had a car accident
on PCH when I was 16.

35:10.674 --> 35:12.212
I was wasted.

35:12.968 --> 35:15.387
There was a family in the other car.

35:18.015 --> 35:19.600
Everyone survived.

35:20.684 --> 35:22.560
But...

35:22.561 --> 35:26.148
I never hated myself so much, so...

35:27.274 --> 35:28.651
I quit.

35:30.569 --> 35:33.696
It's hard to admit to yourself

35:33.697 --> 35:36.659
that you're not strong
enough to handle something.

35:38.744 --> 35:41.704
So, when I need to dig deep

35:41.705 --> 35:43.707
and really feel something...

35:44.959 --> 35:47.962
I just stop trying to control it.

35:55.511 --> 35:57.471
I'm so sorry, Rain.

36:05.317 --> 36:07.588
Thank you for sharing that with me.

36:15.823 --> 36:17.241
You're ready?

36:45.927 --> 36:48.888
Uh, hey, Wyatt. Can I
talk to you for a sec?

36:48.889 --> 36:51.140
Sure. What's up?

36:51.141 --> 36:53.309
Well, I've thought a lot about scene 61

36:53.310 --> 36:56.187
and I know I can give
you a better performance.

36:56.188 --> 36:58.105
I'd like another chance in my close-ups.

36:58.106 --> 36:59.398
We're past that, Townsen.

36:59.399 --> 37:01.692
Like I said, we'll be
on Rainer's coverage.

37:01.693 --> 37:03.361
Right, because you have to cut around me

37:03.362 --> 37:05.446
'cause I didn't deliver.

37:05.447 --> 37:08.241
Wyatt, look, I know I can
do so much better than that.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.079
Please, just give me another chance.

37:15.123 --> 37:16.166
Okay.

37:17.793 --> 37:19.210
Let's do it.

37:19.211 --> 37:20.379
Thank you.

37:23.340 --> 37:26.343
August, we have to talk about this.

37:27.928 --> 37:30.680
- You can't keep avoiding me.
- I'm not going back.

37:30.681 --> 37:34.392
We've built a life here.
These are our children.

37:34.393 --> 37:36.394
Go back and ask Leila again, okay?

37:36.395 --> 37:39.022
- There has to be another way.
- It's not up to us.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.611
At least, this way,
I'll be here with them.

37:46.446 --> 37:48.323
But I'm their mother.

37:49.324 --> 37:50.700
Please!

37:56.081 --> 37:58.083
I want to stay with them.

38:01.461 --> 38:03.672
Don't make me leave.

38:08.343 --> 38:10.303
- And, cut!
- Cutting.

38:14.099 --> 38:15.267
You nailed it.

38:16.977 --> 38:19.311
So, you did have
something to think about.

38:19.312 --> 38:21.480
I guess there's still a
lot about me you don't know.

38:21.481 --> 38:24.400
Wow! Thank you for talking me into that.

38:24.401 --> 38:26.152
So worth it. Loved it.

38:26.153 --> 38:28.405
- Nice job, Townsen.
- Thank you.

38:30.282 --> 38:32.242
I think that was my first compliment.

38:58.185 --> 39:00.187
Nice doing business with you.

39:01.521 --> 39:03.105
You don't want to count it?

39:03.106 --> 39:05.275
I know where to find
you if there's a problem.

39:18.079 --> 39:20.414
Hey, Jake, um, I'm home. Where are you?

39:20.415 --> 39:23.375
Austin. Sorry, I couldn't wait.

39:23.376 --> 39:26.420
Oh! Uh, okay.

39:26.421 --> 39:29.590
I needed to clear my head,
and it's just an interview.

39:29.591 --> 39:30.800
Okay, well...

39:30.801 --> 39:33.385
Hey, listen, I-I've
been thinking all day

39:33.386 --> 39:37.973
and what if I attach
myself to your script

39:37.974 --> 39:39.517
and then I tell Mike Tanen

39:39.518 --> 39:42.102
that I'm only gonna do it
if you stay on as the writer.

39:42.103 --> 39:43.938
Have you read it, the script?

39:43.939 --> 39:46.440
No! But I mean, I-I know it's amazing.

39:46.441 --> 39:49.026
Okay, now I know how Cassie felt.

39:49.027 --> 39:51.320
Um, that was very different.

39:51.321 --> 39:52.613
Why would you attach yourself

39:52.614 --> 39:54.448
to a script you haven't read, Paige?

39:54.449 --> 39:56.409
Unless you felt sorry for me.

39:57.577 --> 39:59.203
I don't need your pity.

39:59.204 --> 40:01.914
I'm trying to help, Jake. I...

40:01.915 --> 40:03.749
And I don't need you
to solve my problems.

40:03.750 --> 40:06.585
And, Paige, if I get
this job, I'm taking it.

40:06.586 --> 40:08.629
Come on! Jake, at least...

40:08.630 --> 40:10.464
Hey, Richard's ready for you.

40:10.465 --> 40:12.550
Uh, look, I gotta go.

40:33.029 --> 40:36.448
Tell me. How did it go? Did Nina buy it?

40:36.449 --> 40:38.534
One hundred percent.

40:38.535 --> 40:41.370
Boy, did I sell it. I
should've stuck with acting.

40:41.371 --> 40:42.788
Impressive.

40:42.789 --> 40:44.582
I knew I picked the
right girl for the job.

40:44.583 --> 40:47.210
So, what did you find?
I'm dying to know.

40:48.461 --> 40:50.254
Every email, every text

40:50.255 --> 40:52.882
Nina Devon's ever received
or sent, it's all here.

40:52.883 --> 40:54.884
James Bond has nothing on you, does he?

40:54.885 --> 40:57.303
I didn't get a chance to
look through everything

40:57.304 --> 41:00.764
but from what I did see,
you won't be disappointed.

41:00.765 --> 41:02.767
And there's something else.

41:09.190 --> 41:12.902
Oh, wow. This looks compromising.

41:12.903 --> 41:15.779
Trust me, their story alone
will make your toes curl

41:15.780 --> 41:18.783
but there's juicy dirt
on the entire cast.

41:19.492 --> 41:20.866
Thank you.

41:22.287 --> 41:24.705
Sounds like I'll finally
be able to go national

41:24.706 --> 41:26.625
and destroy Nina Devon.

41:27.667 --> 41:30.170
It'll sure be fun
taking this bitch down.
