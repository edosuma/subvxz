00:00.059 --> 00:01.177
Previously on The O.C.:

00:01.315 --> 00:05.102
- Carter Buckley, what's he done before?
- He self-published a magazine called Revolution.

00:05.298 --> 00:07.305
I read it religiously. I'd love to meet him.

00:07.368 --> 00:10.467
- Where'd you find this ?
- My husband.
- Well, I'll have to meet him.

00:10.756 --> 00:13.717
LANCE: This is not the moment when you want your somehow perfect reputation undone.

00:13.818 --> 00:18.468
You got three days to give me my money, or everyone in Newport's gonna see a lot more than your face.

00:18.600 --> 00:21.335
- I can't do it. I'm really sorry.
- You can't fight fate.

00:21.536 --> 00:25.665
Now that you and I are back together, and Lindsay's out of the picture, maybe Marissa and Ryan might get it together.

00:25.778 --> 00:29.016
- So, who are you ?
- Whoever you want me to be.

00:30.834 --> 00:33.910
All right, dinner time !
How do you feel about chicken parm ?

00:34.011 --> 00:35.756
That is simply unacceptable.

00:36.005 --> 00:38.077
Hey, don't look at me.
I'm the one who wanted Thai.

00:38.165 --> 00:40.938
Carter, I-I'm gonna have to call you back.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.675
You're off the phone. I barely recognize you without a wire coming out of your ear.

00:46.763 --> 00:48.293
I'm sorry, honey.

00:48.418 --> 00:52.248
It's just we're unveiling the magazine to advertisers in exactly 67 hours,

00:52.324 --> 00:54.696
at which point, I will have some semblance of a life back.

00:54.770 --> 00:56.353
Oh, well, here's hoping.

00:59.590 --> 01:02.027
SETH : Mmm. I thought I smelled Alforno's.

01:02.152 --> 01:04.275
- Thank you, I'm starving.
- Thanks.

01:04.372 --> 01:06.243
Nice. See you later.

01:06.356 --> 01:08.124
Whoa, no, no, no. Sorry !

01:08.401 --> 01:10.234
This is a family dinner.

01:11.176 --> 01:14.715
Uh, the sneak-attack family dinner, dude.
We walked right into it.

01:14.803 --> 01:18.810
- I have to work.
- Yeah, and Ryan and I are in the middle of a very crucial PlayStation game.

01:18.907 --> 01:20.851
- It's kind of like our Super Bowl.
- I don't care.

01:20.952 --> 01:23.777
Nobody here eats tonight unless we sit down and eat as a family.

01:24.041 --> 01:28.169
No excuses. Tonight and together.
Now sit down, everybody, come on.

01:33.101 --> 01:36.049
Family time's always best when it's forced.

01:36.401 --> 01:39.438
You're not gonna be invited on the family trip I'm planning.

01:39.915 --> 01:42.073
Ryan... you ever seen Mount Rushmore ?

01:42.949 --> 01:45.762
- Oh, that could be work.
- Summer gets really mad if I'm not available.

01:45.988 --> 01:48.623
- Marissa's supposed to call me back.
- I will get the phone.

01:48.723 --> 01:51.295
Nobody's taking any calls.
It is dinner time.

01:54.671 --> 01:57.637
Just a second... It's for you.

01:58.794 --> 02:02.552
What ?! How come Ryan gets to talk on the phone during dinner, and I can't play a little PlayStation ?

02:06.326 --> 02:07.618
Hello?

02:10.126 --> 02:11.149
Hey.

02:12.982 --> 02:14.776
Really ! When ?

02:16.161 --> 02:18.456
Yeah. No. All right.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.935
See you then.

02:29.467 --> 02:32.400
- That was Trey.
- Your brother ?

02:33.075 --> 02:36.660
Yeah. He's getting out of jail tomorrow.

02:40.229 --> 02:44.180
- Wants me to pick him up in Chino.
- Well, there's that family trip you wanted.

02:46.000 --> 02:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:25.311 --> 03:29.429
What are you doing in here?
There's bagels and cream cheese to be had in the kitchen.

03:29.546 --> 03:31.870
- Yeah, I'm coming.
- And yet you're sitting.

03:32.652 --> 03:35.884
I guess I just needed a second to brace myself for today.

03:36.024 --> 03:41.021
Yeah. Uh... picking up your brother from prison. That is not, not intense.

03:42.949 --> 03:47.878
- Have you talked to him at all, since...
- Last Thanksgiving when he tried to get me to steal a car, no.

03:50.456 --> 03:54.604
- I kind of thought he was out of my life for good.
- Well, do you want him out of your life?

03:58.906 --> 04:03.431
I don't know. Maybe.
He's my brother, but... the guy's trouble

04:04.164 --> 04:06.668
If you want my advice, I mean, I-I-I...

04:07.208 --> 04:09.909
Who am I kidding ?
I'm totally out of my league on this one.

04:10.102 --> 04:14.633
I will say this, though. As your brother, your other brother, who is less related to you,

04:14.883 --> 04:16.986
- I officially have your back.
- Thanks, man.

04:17.216 --> 04:20.836
- All right. Let's go. Put your shoes on.
Bagels are waiting.
- Yes.

04:20.975 --> 04:23.946
I know Trey is the only family that Ryan has.

04:24.043 --> 04:27.242
- And I do think we should help him.
- But you're scared I'm going to want to adopt him ?

04:28.052 --> 04:31.399
Honey? Don't worry. Trey is 20 years old and an ex-con.

04:31.553 --> 04:35.315
I don't think he wants to be adopted.
But don't you think we got to help him ?

04:35.540 --> 04:39.707
It's just that we don't know what kind of effect this is going to have on Ryan and he's been doing so well this year.

04:40.109 --> 04:42.733
'Morning. You might want to switch to a more neutral topic.

04:42.964 --> 04:46.282
- Yeah, I was just about to come and get you. You ready ?
- Sure.

04:46.572 --> 04:51.802
I appreciate you driving me down to Chino,
but I can take care of this myself.
This shouldn't have to be your problem.

04:51.995 --> 04:54.692
Hey, if it's a Ryan problem,
it's a Cohen problem.

04:55.117 --> 04:57.065
- Here you go. For the road.
- Thanks.

04:59.303 --> 05:04.105
Dad? I think I should head down to prison with you guys and take the day off school

05:04.445 --> 05:09.484
We all know I've had some, well, behavioral issues this year and I think prison might be

05:09.940 --> 05:12.776
- just the thing to scare me straight.
- Nice try.

05:13.933 --> 05:14.956
Get to school.

05:18.665 --> 05:22.344
I don't know any details. Seth just said that Ryan went to go pick up Trey from jail.

05:22.576 --> 05:24.280
Oh, my God, I wish I had known.

05:24.354 --> 05:27.945
So you could have gone with him ?
Because last time you two went to jail,
it did not go so well.

05:28.056 --> 05:30.019
Well, at least I could be there for him.

05:30.179 --> 05:32.963
You sound extremely girlfriendy right now.

05:33.041 --> 05:37.030
Hey, I'm just trying to be his friend,
which is the part we skipped over last time.

05:37.311 --> 05:40.708
Besides, Ryan and Trey have a very complicated relationship.

05:41.035 --> 05:43.357
Speaking of which...

05:44.060 --> 05:45.530
Zach ?

05:46.024 --> 05:48.849
- Oh, my God, I'm having a panic spiral.
- Wait, that's Zach on the Vespa ?

05:49.242 --> 05:53.650
Yeah, I didn't think he'd come back. He was in Italy for so long, I assumed he bought a villa and opened an espresso bar.

05:53.848 --> 05:55.821
- Well, are you gonna say hello ?
- Oh, no, no. I can't.

05:55.920 --> 05:58.945
Last time I saw him is when I ditched him at the airport in front of his family.

05:59.056 --> 06:01.881
- Oh, well, you better say something 'cause he's coming over here.
- I'm about to get bitch-slapped.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.974
- Hi, Zach. Welcome back.
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

06:05.803 --> 06:07.728
Or wait... Buon Giorno.

06:07.866 --> 06:09.899
- Ooh.
- How was Italy ?

06:09.978 --> 06:12.940
Oh, it was amazing. It was probably the best vacation of my life.

06:13.246 --> 06:17.156
Oh, I'm gonna be late.
Listen, great to see you guys.
Just catch up with me at lunch, okay ?

06:17.255 --> 06:20.039
- I've got some awesome pictures to show you
- Okay.

06:20.177 --> 06:23.060
- Great. All right, later.
- Cool, bye.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.088
Ok, somebody totally spiked that guy's gelato

06:26.189 --> 06:28.904
I guess you don't have to worry, Summ.
He seems pretty okay.

06:28.963 --> 06:30.939
Yeah, a little too okay.

06:31.059 --> 06:33.311
I'm not buying it. He's hiding something.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.360
Flashback ?

06:59.800 --> 07:00.961
A little bit.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.853
- It feels like 100 years since I got you out of juvie. Doesn't it ?
- Yeah.

07:08.318 --> 07:11.077
And he's been in there the whole time.

07:14.607 --> 07:18.292
What would you say if Trey stayed with us?
At least for a little while.

07:23.314 --> 07:25.919
I-I don't know.

07:26.401 --> 07:30.337
You know, if no one helps him, statistics say he's back in jail within a year.

07:30.491 --> 07:33.914
Trey's old enough to take care of himself.

07:53.143 --> 07:54.957
Little brother.

07:55.825 --> 07:58.217
Good to see you, man.

08:17.285 --> 08:20.256
- I'm Sandy Cohen.
- Nice to finally meet you.

08:20.815 --> 08:22.972
- You hungry ?
- Starving.

08:23.107 --> 08:25.422
All right. Let's go.

08:49.692 --> 08:52.235
So, I think we hold on this shot of the coast

08:52.370 --> 08:55.592
just a bit longer, just until...
see into this shot.

08:55.746 --> 09:01.020
- What are you two doing ?
- Cutting a video for the showcase,
"An Introduction To Newport Living."

09:01.850 --> 09:04.751
Your magazine?
The one with you on the cover.

09:05.184 --> 09:08.579
Right, right. I'm sorry.
I'm just a little distracted.

09:08.811 --> 09:12.320
Kirsten, could I talk to you for a moment in private ?

09:12.408 --> 09:14.112
I'm going to get some air.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.273
I made a mistake, Kiki.

09:26.466 --> 09:29.147
- A naked mistake.
- Excuse me ?

09:29.861 --> 09:32.389
100 years ago, a boyfriend

09:32.558 --> 09:36.513
convinced me to let him film me in the act.

09:37.073 --> 09:39.899
I was young, living on ramen, I needed the money. Then I totally freaked.

09:40.034 --> 09:44.974
I told him he could never show it to anyone, let alone release it, which he didn't. Un-until now...

09:45.181 --> 09:48.480
- unless I give him half a million dollars.
- Did you talk to a lawyer ?

09:48.905 --> 09:53.253
Sandy was able to negotiate the rights from him, but we still need to come up with the money.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.891
Well, if Sandy can't help you, you're going to have to tell my dad.

09:59.502 --> 10:01.856
TREY : This is it. Right here.

10:12.091 --> 10:14.387
- Now, who are you staying with again ?
- It's my buddy, Rick.

10:14.522 --> 10:18.275
Well, I think it's his brother's house.
But they said it's cool if I stay there.

10:28.011 --> 10:30.789
- Good to see ya.
- Take care of yourself, Ry.

10:32.853 --> 10:35.859
- Thanks for lunch again, Mr. Cohen.
- Take care.

10:37.306 --> 10:38.984
I'll call ya.

11:01.363 --> 11:04.566
What do you say we give it a try ?
Just for a few days.

11:08.825 --> 11:12.535
Hey, Trey? Want to come with us ?

11:24.226 --> 11:28.229
Hey, man, you came back.
People never leave and come back.

11:28.480 --> 11:31.014
How you doing, man ? Long time no see.
How you been ?

11:31.144 --> 11:33.972
Good. Dude, things are really good.

11:34.474 --> 11:38.444
Listen, about what happened with you,
me and Summer...

11:38.560 --> 11:42.901
Don't worry about it, man.
You and Summer belong together.
I should have clued in to that a while ago.

11:43.075 --> 11:46.216
Actually, I did clue into that a while ago.

11:46.698 --> 11:49.814
- Whatever, man. I'm fine with it.
- Yeah ?
- Yeah.

11:50.094 --> 11:54.274
- You seem different. You seem like you're
- Operating at a very high frequency ?

11:54.728 --> 11:58.664
- If I tell you something, you promise not to tell Summer?
- Yeah, okay.

11:58.992 --> 12:03.992
I know my track record with secret keeping hasn't been that good, but it's got to turn around sometime.

12:04.178 --> 12:08.191
Look, man, when I was in Italy,
I met someone. Her name's Francesca.

12:08.442 --> 12:11.276
- Yeah ? What's she like ?
- Tall, blonde, gorgeous.

12:11.409 --> 12:13.763
Doesn't speak much English,
but she's learning.

12:13.859 --> 12:16.618
When we met, it was like... we just clicked.

12:16.773 --> 12:19.090
Yeah? Are you guys still clicking, though?
I mean, across the globe ?

12:19.239 --> 12:22.923
Dude, we got webcam, we got e-mail,
we got instant-message date.

12:23.116 --> 12:27.166
- Wow, long-distance dating is so hot.
- Do me a favor, all right ?

12:27.357 --> 12:30.443
Don't tell Summer. It might hurt her feelings that I moved on so quickly.

12:30.810 --> 12:33.951
- Yeah, yeah. My lips are sealed.
- Cool.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.437
Well, this is the crib.

12:53.541 --> 12:56.589
- You've got to be kidding me.
- You know, if it's any consolation,

12:56.744 --> 12:58.962
I felt the same way the first time I saw it.

12:59.811 --> 13:01.895
Bet you get used to it, huh ?

13:03.763 --> 13:07.844
Trey, why don't you stay in the pool house?
Ryan, why don't you take the guest room?

13:08.104 --> 13:11.712
- Uh, yeah, okay.
- Wait, did he just say pool house ?

13:19.721 --> 13:22.244
This is where you've been living ?

13:24.444 --> 13:27.203
Oh, you got hooked up.

13:32.109 --> 13:35.987
Towels are in the linen closet, and you can borrow whatever shower stuff you need.

13:36.161 --> 13:38.106
Thanks.

13:39.225 --> 13:42.678
And, uh, sorry I'm kicking you out of your little cabana mansion here.

13:43.006 --> 13:45.553
It's only for a few days.

13:47.221 --> 13:49.536
Don't worry. I won't get too comfortable.

13:49.787 --> 13:54.147
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean...
- No, I know I'm crashing your party here.

13:54.417 --> 13:57.870
But you've got a good thing going on here,

13:58.611 --> 14:00.108
and I'm not going to screw it up.

14:02.577 --> 14:04.182
I promise.

14:07.170 --> 14:10.390
- Uh, see you later.
- See you later.

14:29.838 --> 14:32.196
Hey, man, I want some details.

14:32.418 --> 14:34.674
Does Trey seem different to you ? I mean,

14:34.934 --> 14:39.191
Has he found Jesus ? Does he have a Chinese tattoo ? Did he shave his head ?

14:41.041 --> 14:44.128
- 0 for 3.
- Oh, hi. You're, uh, not Ryan.

14:44.459 --> 14:45.838
Nope. Trey.

14:45.904 --> 14:49.126
Yeah, well, I was close.
You're still an Atwood.

14:49.208 --> 14:53.122
Only a slightly more edgy,
darker version, I think.

14:53.304 --> 14:57.233
- But some people think Ryan's gotten
a little softer.
- Ryan said you talk a lot.

14:57.366 --> 15:01.617
Yeah, it's kind of a problem, but hopefully one you'll come to find endearing.

15:02.760 --> 15:06.348
How's it, you know, feel to be, like, out?

15:08.284 --> 15:12.895
- Good.
- Yeah, cool, monosyllables run in the family. That's awesome... Hey.

15:13.358 --> 15:18.012
- Good, you two have already met.
Trey's going to be staying with us.
- Just until I can find my own place.

15:19.633 --> 15:22.837
I thought you might need to do a little shopping. This is just enough to get you started.

15:23.069 --> 15:25.673
For clothing, toiletries, all the basics.

15:26.908 --> 15:28.313
- You sure ?
- Of course.

15:28.563 --> 15:31.573
- Ryan, you can show Trey where to go ?
- Yeah.

15:36.315 --> 15:39.556
You want me to come ? I've got a knack
for picking out the post-prison wardrobe.

15:40.002 --> 15:43.839
TREY : You coming ?
- Yeah. You know what ?
Call Marissa. Have her meet us.

15:44.066 --> 15:46.839
Yeah, it's probably a better job for
Cosmo girl.

15:47.927 --> 15:51.086
Not like you  to drop in for lunch.
To what do I owe the pleasure ?

15:51.273 --> 15:54.694
Well, with all the hustle and bustle of this showcase, I've barely seen you.

15:54.814 --> 15:56.608
It's crawfish, your favorite.

15:56.841 --> 15:59.474
I just thought we should check in.
You know, have a State of the Union.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.807
Sounds fair enough. What's on the agenda?

16:03.024 --> 16:06.491
I think we ought to replace the showerhead in the one guest bathroom upstairs.

16:06.658 --> 16:11.936
Oh, and you really have to fire that new gardener. Those are some sorry-looking hydrangea bushes out front.

16:12.458 --> 16:15.175
Fine. Is there anything else ?

16:16.941 --> 16:19.532
I made an adult film in the '80s
with an ex-boyfriend

16:19.650 --> 16:23.125
who's now threatening to release it on the Internet unless I pay him half a million dollars.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.466
And I really would like to redo the kitchen.

16:26.950 --> 16:30.633
- Are you saying you did porn ?
- It was erotica. Tasteful, at times.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.942
You've got yourself in quite a bind.

16:33.038 --> 16:36.541
See, I knew it. I knew that you would react this way. Absolutely no sympathy.

16:36.625 --> 16:39.633
And this from a man who kept an illegitimate child hidden from me...

16:39.740 --> 16:41.692
All right, I'll pay the money.

16:42.641 --> 16:46.214
- You will ?
- Well, your dignity is at stake. I'd say that's worth half a million dollars.

16:49.527 --> 16:50.991
Oh, thank God.

16:51.625 --> 16:55.892
You have no idea how much damage this could have caused the magazine, Marissa, me.

16:56.025 --> 17:00.008
I'll call my financial advisor.
You should go back to work.

17:00.192 --> 17:03.290
Right, because I have a magazine to launch.

17:08.142 --> 17:10.790
Cal... thank you.

17:30.064 --> 17:33.981
- How can Zach act so normal around me ?
- And here we are again.

17:34.514 --> 17:38.414
No, I mean I ditched him at the airport.
It's not what you call letting him down easy

17:38.514 --> 17:41.997
I'm not certain on this, but I thought you and I were dating.

17:42.081 --> 17:45.692
I know. I just didn't expect him to get over me so fast.

17:45.848 --> 17:50.148
Yeah, well, Zach's resilient. I mean, under all that floppy hair and goofy smile,

17:50.514 --> 17:52.804
- there's like a layer of steel.
- You talked to him today, right ?

17:53.514 --> 17:56.814
Well, did he say anything ? Any footnotes to the whole "I Love Italy" story ?

17:58.797 --> 18:01.414
- No. I mean, I...
- Spill it, Cohen.

18:01.597 --> 18:05.164
- He made me promise to keep it a secret.
- Have you ever kept one in your life ?

18:05.364 --> 18:09.181
- He has a girlfriend.
- Already ? He's only been back
like one day.

18:09.364 --> 18:11.497
He met her in Italy. Her name's Francesca.

18:11.647 --> 18:15.614
And she's tall and beautiful and he's way into her, okay ? Great.

18:16.714 --> 18:19.674
I say we get burgers and two vanilla milkshakes and fries.

18:21.298 --> 18:22.792
She's tall ?

18:23.658 --> 18:27.828
- $200 for this watch ? You believe that ?
- I know. These stores are kind of pricey.

18:28.062 --> 18:30.645
Yeah, bet you've got a closet full of this stuff, huh ?

18:30.762 --> 18:34.245
Shirts with alligators, top siders,
the whole deal?

18:37.928 --> 18:40.345
Maybe we should go. You know, you're not going to find anything you need here.

18:40.478 --> 18:43.112
What are you kidding ? I've got cash to spend. I'm not going anywhere.

18:43.945 --> 18:47.595
- Hey, I found you.
- Hey, Marissa. Trey.

18:48.928 --> 18:54.111
- We've met before. Marissa Cooper.
- Oh, yeah. You're Ry's girlfriend.

18:55.511 --> 18:59.011
- Oh, well, no, well, not anymore.
- We're just friends.

19:00.894 --> 19:04.144
Not just friends, but... friends. Right ?

19:04.311 --> 19:09.228
Right. I heard Ryan was taking you shopping, so I figured you probably need some help.

19:09.344 --> 19:12.444
Here, why don't you try this, and I'll grab you some more stuff.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.772
- Seth said you might need some backup.
- Yeah, thanks for coming.

19:21.589 --> 19:24.839
Wow, look at this.
Yeah, this has you written all over it.

19:25.905 --> 19:28.689
Yeah, that looks really adorable on you.

19:29.239 --> 19:32.548
- 'cause you're so cute.
- Really, I thought ugly hats were your thing

19:32.672 --> 19:35.289
It looks really good on you.
Honestly, you should look at you...

19:37.772 --> 19:42.239
So, to my utter shock, he agreed to pay in full. Crisis averted.

19:43.072 --> 19:45.339
I guess my dad's softening in his old age.

19:45.489 --> 19:48.746
That or he has a porn tape buried in his past, too.

19:49.113 --> 19:51.363
Speaking metaphorically, of course.

19:53.330 --> 19:56.396
Hello, Kiki ? I'm talking about erotica.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.197
I'm sorry. What were you saying ?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.525
- You like Carter.
- Excuse me?

20:06.634 --> 20:10.025
You have a thing for Carter.
Kirsten Cohen crushes Carter.

20:10.159 --> 20:14.672
- That's ridiculous.
- Here I have been so preoccupied with my own sex scandal, I hadn't noticed yours.

20:14.977 --> 20:17.465
- That's enough.
- Sandy's off in strange motels with

20:17.544 --> 20:20.953
that fugitive ex-girlfriend of his, so you
decide to turn up the heat at the office ?

20:21.197 --> 20:24.662
Stop it. I do not have feelings for...

20:24.935 --> 20:26.907
- Sandy !
- Surprise.

20:28.204 --> 20:30.939
Julie and I were just going over some magazine stuff.

20:31.205 --> 20:34.639
Launch fever. Well, I'll let you two talk.

20:40.890 --> 20:43.406
So, what's up ?

20:43.840 --> 20:46.973
- I invited Trey to stay with us for a few days.
- Okay, sounds good.

20:47.165 --> 20:50.365
Sounds good ? I thought you were going to have a five-alarm freak-out.

20:50.465 --> 20:54.433
Well, I trust you. I mean, you were right about Ryan, after all.

20:55.165 --> 20:57.348
I-I'll see you tonight.

20:57.565 --> 21:00.686
Hey, wait, now where's this famous Carter Buckley ? I'd love to meet him.

21:02.435 --> 21:05.247
Oh, uh, toni... it's-it's not a good time.

21:05.422 --> 21:08.430
He's up, uh... up to his ears in the launch.

21:08.761 --> 21:11.619
All right, some other time, then.
I'll see you tonight.

21:14.009 --> 21:15.844
Man, am I tired.

21:15.950 --> 21:19.897
That's shopper's fatigue. Shop enough and you'll become immune. Trust me.

21:19.981 --> 21:22.579
- If anyone should know.
- Hmm ! That's funny.

21:22.646 --> 21:24.896
Excuse me? Can I check your bag?

21:25.496 --> 21:28.913
- Why ? I didn't do anything wrong.
- I saw you handling that watch before.

21:30.413 --> 21:33.696
- I didn't take your damn watch.
- We have the right to look through your bag. Just hand it over.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.322
I see other people with bags here,
I don't see you giving them a hard time.

21:36.450 --> 21:39.881
- Look, he didn't take anything.
- Just let him check through your bag.
- Hey, man, I'll handle this.

21:42.540 --> 21:45.707
- Why don't you get out of my face ?
- Send someone to the front entrance.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.860
You know what ? Don't bother.

21:49.210 --> 21:51.227
I paid... for all of this.

22:06.776 --> 22:10.643
If we hadn't gotten Trey out of the store,
I swear he would have taken the guy out.

22:10.859 --> 22:14.326
So he's got rage issues.
Like, uh, like Summer, or...?

22:14.459 --> 22:17.026
He's just got a lot of pride, you know ?

22:17.126 --> 22:20.392
And a short fuse. When something sets him off, it's like he can't control himself.

22:20.609 --> 22:23.392
Well, it's comforting to have him staying here.

22:23.526 --> 22:25.642
- Have you told my parents ?
- No, I can't.

22:26.026 --> 22:30.692
- I know I should, but...
- Hey, Ryan. I finally met your brother.

22:31.326 --> 22:34.609
- He seems to be adjusting well.
- Yeah, smooth sailing.

22:34.959 --> 22:37.959
Here's one. A barista at a local coffee joint

22:38.359 --> 22:41.293
- Barista ?
- Oh, that's a fancy word for a guy who makes coffee.

22:41.407 --> 22:43.060
That I can do.

22:43.327 --> 22:45.887
We were just checking out the classifieds.

22:46.047 --> 22:50.004
- Job hunt begins today.
Feel like coming with me ?
- I'll pass, thanks.

22:52.223 --> 22:54.506
Seth, why don't you come out and

22:54.900 --> 22:57.130
clear the patio furniture with me for the party ?

22:57.236 --> 22:59.569
I believe, son, that's code for
"Let's get out of here."

22:59.903 --> 23:02.570
If I help clear it, can I skip it ?

23:08.687 --> 23:10.728
Again, I'm sorry about yesterday.

23:10.837 --> 23:14.154
- I just didn't like the way the guy was looking at me.
- So you trashed the store.

23:15.732 --> 23:19.349
My old ways aren't gonna work here.
I need to change.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.271
Do it soon.

23:35.538 --> 23:37.436
- Zach.
- Hey. Uh...

23:37.721 --> 23:39.771
I brought over some of your stuff.

23:40.333 --> 23:45.458
- Things you left at my house.
- Post-breakup stuff exchange.

23:45.750 --> 23:48.292
I won this for you at the Kick-off Carnival.
It was a gift.

23:48.438 --> 23:51.104
And I'll always remember how you owned that Whack-a-Mole.

23:52.792 --> 23:55.646
I don't feel like it's a good idea to have reminders of you lying around.

23:55.958 --> 24:00.312
- Look, I get that you moved on, but do you have to, like, totally erase me ?
- What do you mean, "moved on" ?

24:02.760 --> 24:04.792
- Cohen.
- He let it slip, okay?

24:05.026 --> 24:08.724
- I just, I didn't want you to know, in case it hurt your feelings.
- Why would it hurt my feelings ?

24:08.932 --> 24:14.177
Just because 20 minutes after we broke up you're scootering around Italy with some six-foot-two Euro-chick ?

24:14.294 --> 24:17.864
- Hey, you left me.
- I know. I know that, but...

24:19.729 --> 24:23.224
The entire cast of The Valley are guest VJ's on Music Video Nation

24:23.374 --> 24:25.674
and I kind of have to see that. So I will drop off your stuff soon.

24:25.758 --> 24:27.941
- Summer, wait !
- Arrivederci.

24:35.399 --> 24:37.716
Well, how do you like this ?

24:38.182 --> 24:40.799
Caleb Nichol showing up at my lowly hotel room.

24:40.949 --> 24:43.116
Let's get this over with.

24:45.349 --> 24:46.982
Thank you.

24:47.816 --> 24:51.332
Video's right here. It's all yours if the money's in that case.

24:52.899 --> 24:57.233
$500,000. As requested.
I'm assured this is the only copy ?

24:58.399 --> 24:59.999
This is it.

25:01.661 --> 25:04.077
So how's it feel ?

25:04.227 --> 25:06.727
Get a little glimpse into your wife's past.

25:07.311 --> 25:10.277
I didn't get where I am today by being a fool

25:10.411 --> 25:12.811
I knew what I was getting into when
I married Julie Cooper.

25:12.944 --> 25:17.778
So you expect me to believe that she told you about this ? Because Julie keeps her past pretty tight to the vest.

25:18.178 --> 25:22.170
I have some very thorough and talented P.I.'s on my staff.

25:22.878 --> 25:25.961
I venture to say there's nothing Julie's ever done that I don't know about.

25:27.411 --> 25:28.922
Allow me.

25:34.936 --> 25:36.443
Oh, what the hell is this ?

25:36.830 --> 25:39.870
- These are some friends of mine looking forward to getting to know you.
- You son of a bitch.

25:40.230 --> 25:42.670
That's your cue to hand me the briefcase.

25:47.243 --> 25:49.150
Lance ?

25:52.483 --> 25:54.763
Pleasure doing business with you.
Thanks for the tape.

26:00.267 --> 26:03.521
I'd like those flowers delivered by 5:00.
Thank you.

26:04.227 --> 26:05.827
Hey, what do you think?
For tonight?

26:06.001 --> 26:09.094
I wanted Donatella Versace meets
Martha Stewart before the scandal.

26:09.534 --> 26:11.681
Oh, don't look now. Boyfriend, 2:00.

26:11.801 --> 26:15.627
Hey! Brought you something. Pinot noir.
Russian River Valley. Hi.

26:15.787 --> 26:18.237
- Hey.
- The one you said you loved.

26:20.107 --> 26:24.940
- Thank you, Carter. How thoughtful.
- I thought we'd, pop the top, have a few glasses before the madness begins.

26:25.240 --> 26:29.840
We have a lot riding on this presentation.
I think it would be unprofessional to drink wine beforehand.

26:30.890 --> 26:33.773
Are you kidding ?
We average a bottle a night around here.

26:35.492 --> 26:38.658
- You can celebrate at the party tonight.
- Okay.

26:40.125 --> 26:44.475
Okay. I'll see you later.
Completely focused and totally sober.

26:48.142 --> 26:51.133
"Kirsten and Carter
Sitting in a tree..."

26:52.233 --> 26:55.883
I'm just kidding. Unless... I'm not.

26:57.150 --> 26:59.800
Julie: "K-I-S-S-I-N-G".

27:05.592 --> 27:09.508
Oh... Summer.
I thought we'd seen the last of you.

27:09.708 --> 27:13.169
- Is Zach home ?
- He's at water polo practice.
He'll be home in a few minutes.

27:13.358 --> 27:17.141
Can I leave this stuff with you ?
He left it at my house when we were dating

27:20.157 --> 27:22.724
So it's really over between the two of you?

27:23.941 --> 27:27.891
- Mrs. Stevens, I am so sorry about what happened at the airport.
- You should be.

27:28.707 --> 27:30.940
But at least something good came out of it, right ?

27:31.174 --> 27:33.557
- I mean, Zach met Francesca.
- Who ?

27:33.940 --> 27:37.490
You know, six-foot-two, Italian supermodel.
Zach's new girlfriend ?

27:37.841 --> 27:41.591
And when would this have happened?
While he was sulking over you?

27:42.024 --> 27:44.090
He never left the hotel room, Summer.

27:55.734 --> 27:58.217
How'd the job hunt go today ?

27:58.967 --> 28:00.800
Not so good.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.667
Tried five or six places...

28:03.984 --> 28:06.879
They all turned me down on the spot.

28:08.467 --> 28:09.584
Sucks.

28:13.401 --> 28:16.377
You hungry ? Grab a bite ? Catch up ?

28:20.018 --> 28:21.818
Yeah. That'd be great.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.370
Cool.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.770
We should head by the pier. You'll like it.

28:27.954 --> 28:30.637
They got, you know, boats and stuff.

28:32.220 --> 28:35.520
After you clean this place up. Geez, man.

28:35.803 --> 28:39.370
You do have closets, you know.
Look who's funny...

28:51.819 --> 28:55.502
- This is the watch from that store.
- Yeah, I went back today and bought it.
- Don't lie to me.

28:57.186 --> 29:00.552
- I'm not.
- You're never gonna change.

29:01.753 --> 29:05.019
- This family is taking a chance on you.
- You know what ?

29:06.236 --> 29:10.269
It makes no difference what I tell you, 'cause you're only going to believe the worst about me, no matter what I do.

29:10.420 --> 29:14.186
- Can you blame me ?
- Guess I don't. So why don't I do us both a favor and just take off ?

29:14.353 --> 29:18.036
- Fine !
- Oh, and I bought it as a gift for you.

29:18.620 --> 29:22.667
To thank you for helping me out, and, before you go calling the cops on me...

29:24.303 --> 29:26.603
here's the receipt.

29:36.193 --> 29:39.326
Well, the party's starting soon.
Are you hiding out in here ?

29:39.509 --> 29:41.843
- Yeah, good guess.
- Where's Trey ?

29:43.893 --> 29:47.576
I see. We knew it was gonna be bumpy.

29:49.293 --> 29:51.659
- This is harder than I thought it'd be.
- Is there anything I can do ?

29:53.732 --> 29:56.399
Can I borrow the car ?

29:57.799 --> 29:59.465
Be careful.

30:05.269 --> 30:09.335
Zach. Hey ! I realize I forgot to give you your sweatshirt back.

30:09.485 --> 30:12.619
- You know, and I was going to.
- I know you talked to my mom today.

30:12.752 --> 30:15.169
Brief conversation... Brief.

30:15.252 --> 30:19.385
And I know she told you about Francesca,
or, lack thereof.

30:20.802 --> 30:22.752
- You don't need to explain.
- No, I do.

30:22.902 --> 30:26.419
When I came home, I knew that I was going to see you and Cohen,

30:26.586 --> 30:28.919
and I didn't want things to be tense between us,

30:29.552 --> 30:33.369
and I figured the only way to do that was
if I was with someone, too.

30:36.119 --> 30:37.985
Zach, I'm sorry.

30:38.835 --> 30:41.619
And you told Cohen because...

30:41.885 --> 30:44.719
- you knew that it would get back to me.
- Within minutes.

30:46.035 --> 30:50.776
God, that is so typical of Cohen. I mean, he knew that it would make me jealous.

30:51.010 --> 30:53.779
- Summer, remember, she's a fake.
- Yeah, but still.

30:53.927 --> 30:56.793
Cohen could not wait to tell me about your smoking new girlfriend.

30:56.877 --> 30:59.777
This is between you and Cohen.

31:00.972 --> 31:03.506
Which has nothing to do with me.

31:04.372 --> 31:05.622
Finally.

31:08.856 --> 31:12.706
I am so sorry that I made a mess of everything.

31:14.472 --> 31:17.872
As for Francesca,
unlike some loudmouth geeks,

31:19.122 --> 31:21.922
I can keep a secret.

31:25.514 --> 31:28.314
- Hey, Ryan, where you going ?
- To get Trey. He took off.

31:28.497 --> 31:30.197
Well, I'll go with you.

31:30.331 --> 31:34.264
- Remember what happened last time you came to Chino ?
- Yeah, I saved your ass. Come on.

31:34.597 --> 31:37.847
Do you realize that in a couple of days your face will be on

31:37.964 --> 31:40.138
every coffee table in this town ?

31:40.280 --> 31:42.914
Well, frankly, I'm surprised we even got it off the ground.

31:43.088 --> 31:45.575
- Well, I'm not surprised at all.
- Hi, Dad.

31:46.771 --> 31:50.483
- I know this magazine is going to be
an enormous success.
- Absolutely.

31:50.563 --> 31:54.646
- I take it everything went smoothly ?
- Everything's taken care of, JuJu.

31:58.654 --> 32:02.104
Hey! You made it.
I was starting to get worried. Thank you.

32:02.187 --> 32:04.570
Well, I came for Newport Living.
I do live in Newport.

32:05.504 --> 32:07.954
Oh, is that what this party's for? I didn't

32:10.287 --> 32:13.804
- What's the deal ? Is it something I said ?
- Something you weren't supposed to say ?

32:15.509 --> 32:17.926
Right. I guess I did something wrong,

32:18.043 --> 32:20.809
so I should probably just apologize.

32:21.026 --> 32:24.684
- Yeah, if you mean it.
- It's kind of hard to mean it if I don't know what it is.

32:24.910 --> 32:29.360
It's kind of hard to forgive you if you don't mean it, 'cause you don't know what you're supposed to be apologizing for.

32:29.570 --> 32:32.504
I'm going to wait in your room for 20 minutes. If you can't figure it out by then, I'm gone.

32:34.387 --> 32:37.370
- Hello, everybody. Julie, congratulations
- Thank you.

32:37.587 --> 32:39.487
- May I speak with you for a moment ?
- Sure.

32:41.670 --> 32:45.154
- What is it ?
- Have I said something to you ?

32:45.287 --> 32:49.336
Have I done something wrong? 'Cause all
day you have seemed angry at me

32:52.370 --> 32:55.207
Look, whatever it is, I hope you can talk to me about it,

32:55.271 --> 32:58.428
because we are liable to be working
together for a long time,
so I don't want to...

33:04.567 --> 33:08.130
On second thought, let's just focus on the presentation.

33:09.627 --> 33:11.611
I hope it goes without a hitch.

33:17.503 --> 33:20.991
- Excuse me, is that chardonnay ?
- Yes, ma'am, it is.
- Thank you.

33:28.162 --> 33:30.529
We used to hang out at this place all the time.

33:38.270 --> 33:39.849
I'll be back in a second.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.454
What the hell are you doing here, man ?

33:53.745 --> 33:55.924
- I came to find you.
- I'm not looking to be found.

33:56.049 --> 33:58.652
- Trey, listen...
- Beat it, little brother.

34:01.712 --> 34:05.158
- I just want to talk to you, all right ?
- Why, man? You're in your pool house, and

34:05.691 --> 34:09.036
- and I'm here. I'm sorry, all right ?
- Why are we kidding ourselves here, Ry ?

34:09.594 --> 34:13.300
You knew it couldn't work.
We are who we are.

34:15.989 --> 34:19.051
- I'm not going back to Newport
without you.
- Fine.

34:21.152 --> 34:22.420
Stay here.

34:22.507 --> 34:26.443
See how well you fit in after being away two years. I'm going to go out for some air.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.159
Okay,

34:45.088 --> 34:47.092
I thought about it.
I thought about why you're angry.

34:47.188 --> 34:49.163
- And ?
- I have nothing.

34:49.440 --> 34:51.995
I do not know what I did wrong.

34:52.139 --> 34:55.456
Summer, but listen, I'm totally willing to apologize, extremely, sincerely.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.387
Why did you tell me about Francesca ?

34:58.922 --> 35:03.114
- because you begged me to.
- That is not why, Cohen. I have begged you to do plenty of stuff.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.337
Like give up comic books, stop mumbling, and you don't do any of that.

35:06.442 --> 35:09.407
Are you actually angry with me for being jealous of you

35:09.482 --> 35:11.583
- being jealous of Zach ?
- No.

35:12.298 --> 35:14.975
- You were jealous ?
- Gee, why would that be, Summer ?

35:15.178 --> 35:19.368
- Hearing you go on and on about Zach's new woman.
- Because you told me about her.

35:19.455 --> 35:23.637
Yeah, I did. I saw the high road there and I just did not take it on that one. You want to know why ?

35:25.679 --> 35:27.346
I was a little bit worried.

35:27.479 --> 35:31.313
Here we have this big great kiss in the rain upside down, and I don't know,

35:31.546 --> 35:34.529
I thought, maybe what if after that, everything was a letdown for you ?

35:34.763 --> 35:36.779
You had buyer's remorse or something?

35:40.096 --> 35:41.246
Cohen...

35:42.746 --> 35:47.155
- You are so neurotic.
- Exactly.

35:47.571 --> 35:51.054
Unlike Zach, who's anxiety-free with
his big smile

35:51.404 --> 35:53.571
and natural athleticism.

35:53.854 --> 35:57.504
- That guy makes me feel very Jewish.
- Look, I know Zach looks great on paper :

35:57.706 --> 36:03.048
the son of a congressman, sweet, selfless, and even, well, boring.

36:03.181 --> 36:06.281
- Yeah, he's a touch bland.
- Yeah... And you,

36:06.748 --> 36:09.864
with all your little flaws and your little quirks,

36:10.398 --> 36:12.848
somehow you keep drawing me back in.

36:14.468 --> 36:16.918
Yeah? So what you're saying to me is then,

36:17.185 --> 36:20.135
that the more neurotic and insecure I am,

36:20.351 --> 36:22.568
- the more you're attracted to me ?
- Hmm ?

36:22.768 --> 36:25.285
Well, then, do I look fat in these pants ?

36:27.051 --> 36:30.568
Hello, everyone. I'm Carter Buckley,
managing editor.

36:30.651 --> 36:35.684
And on behalf of everyone at Newport Living, I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight.

36:37.986 --> 36:42.270
Now I would like to introduce the woman who has made all of this possible...

36:43.053 --> 36:45.770
Julie Cooper Nichol.

36:47.520 --> 36:50.836
Thank you, Carter. I can't believe this night is finally here.

36:51.986 --> 36:54.653
Well, what is Newport Living ?

36:54.986 --> 36:58.059
- Wow, so that's Carter Buckley ?
- You haven't met him yet ?

36:58.203 --> 37:00.986
No, he's been more of a phantom presence

37:01.169 --> 37:04.103
- I thought he'd look more like Jerry Garcia.
- Who ?

37:04.353 --> 37:09.033
But if you really want to know what Newport Living is all about, take a look at this.

37:11.836 --> 37:13.986
"If I'd never had sex before..."

37:14.742 --> 37:17.359
"why do I feel so horny ?"

37:18.176 --> 37:19.959
"You're turning me on."
Dear God.

37:20.142 --> 37:22.142
- Oh, my God.
- Julie, give me the remote.

37:22.325 --> 37:24.309
"Come over here, pizza boy."

37:45.096 --> 37:48.212
- Oh, you son of a...
- Sorry about that, everyone.
- Julie, let's get you out of here.

37:48.338 --> 37:52.938
technical difficulties. Please, everyone, help themselves to a drink...

37:53.172 --> 37:56.672
or two. Lord knows... I'm going to.

38:06.688 --> 38:10.105
Don't worry, Ju-Ju. It'll all blow over.

38:10.988 --> 38:14.005
I don't understand. I mean, you gave him his damn money.

38:14.788 --> 38:17.738
It just goes to show, it doesn't pay to give in to these people.

38:18.638 --> 38:21.838
You meet their every demand,
and they ruin you, anyway.

38:22.105 --> 38:24.588
Well, "ruin's" the wrong word.

38:24.738 --> 38:27.971
You can go on with your life, Cal,
but I am never leaving this room.

38:28.390 --> 38:31.607
My Howard Hughes phase starts now.

38:32.223 --> 38:36.690
We could go to Europe. Paris, Vienna,
anywhere you like.

38:36.923 --> 38:41.656
By the time we get back, something else will have exploded to make this whole thing look silly.

38:43.390 --> 38:46.640
I guess you can always count on this town for a new scandal.

38:49.045 --> 38:50.662
Paris ?

38:51.629 --> 38:55.095
Carter ? Sandy Cohen.
You throw a hell of a party.

38:55.195 --> 38:57.295
- Sandy, it's great to finally meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

38:57.428 --> 39:00.562
- I'm so sorry I haven't introduced you two.
- Oh, no problem.

39:00.945 --> 39:05.312
- You sound like you have a wonderful family
- I do. Thank you. Including my mother-in-law, the porn star.

39:06.162 --> 39:08.428
Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I think it kind of livened things up.

39:08.628 --> 39:13.004
Yeah, well, here's hoping everyone was drunk enough they black out and don't remember anything tomorrow.

39:13.328 --> 39:17.145
- Here's hoping. Can I get you two anything?
- Oh, no thanks, I'm fine.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.642
Listen... about before,

39:24.109 --> 39:26.642
- I have to apologize.
- You do ?

39:26.776 --> 39:29.809
Yeah, you know, we have been working together for a few weeks now,

39:29.976 --> 39:33.719
and I just want you to know that if
there has been a...

39:34.493 --> 39:38.359
- tension between us...
- I don't know what you're talking about.

39:38.642 --> 39:42.207
If there's been a... vibe, between us...

39:43.842 --> 39:46.776
...it's me, okay ? And I'm sorry.

39:47.342 --> 39:50.075
- Carter...
- Let's just leave it at that, all right ?

39:59.746 --> 40:02.513
Ryan, I don't think he's coming back.

40:06.229 --> 40:10.013
You're right. Let's go.

40:13.564 --> 40:16.213
- Hey, you feel like playing some pool ?
- No, thanks.

40:16.494 --> 40:18.544
- All right, then let me buy you a drink.
- Hey, I don't think

40:18.744 --> 40:20.828
- She wants anything.
- Was I talking to you ?

40:21.028 --> 40:24.661
- Know what ? We should get out of here.
- What ? I just want to buy you a drink.
Why you being rude ?

40:24.928 --> 40:27.128
- I don't want anything to drink.
- Hey, leave her alone, all right ?

40:27.378 --> 40:30.295
Listen, rich boy, I ain't buying the act, all right? Let's get out of here.

40:31.545 --> 40:34.478
- Let go of her.
- Come on. You want some more ?

40:44.504 --> 40:46.750
Stop it, please!

40:49.954 --> 40:52.221
Can I help you ?

40:54.021 --> 40:56.238
Tell your friends to let go of my brother !

40:58.021 --> 40:59.471
Let him go.

41:01.454 --> 41:04.087
Yeah, come on. Let's go.

41:23.190 --> 41:27.056
Wow, kid ! I haven't done that in a while. Looked good.

41:27.256 --> 41:29.190
Thanks for coming back for us.

41:29.456 --> 41:33.273
Yeah? Well, I was gonna say the same thing to you guys.

41:34.556 --> 41:36.540
You want a ride ?

41:39.302 --> 41:42.269
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, where are we dropping you ?

41:45.452 --> 41:47.852
Just come home with us, man.

41:48.807 --> 41:52.874
- I thought you didn't want me over there.
- eah, well, people change.

41:56.290 --> 41:59.174
All right. But I get to drive.

41:59.573 --> 42:02.390
Oh, no, no. I've seen you drive.
You're in the back seat.

42:04.107 --> 42:07.373
- Can't touch this, you can't touch this!
- I'll drive.

42:17.866 --> 42:21.716
Hey ! You guys were gone a while.
Everything okay ?

42:22.216 --> 42:25.033
- Fine.
- Yeah, nothing to report.
- How was the party ?

42:25.249 --> 42:27.366
- Good.
- Uneventful.

42:30.696 --> 42:34.079
Hey, guys. Great party, okay ?

42:34.429 --> 42:37.313
Well, if you're hungry, we got leftovers.

42:38.812 --> 42:43.612
- Dad. We're all having a family dinner.
- You know, how about that ? Look at that.

42:43.812 --> 42:47.162
- Now this is not so painful.
- I got to tell you, seems pretty great.

42:47.378 --> 42:50.095
Yeah, wait till the novelty wears off, right, Ryan ?

42:50.245 --> 42:52.711
You know what? It still works for me.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.369
That's very...
