WEBVTT

00:45.171 --> 00:46.331
(Laughing)

00:52.511 --> 00:54.502
I'm lighting a candle for David.

00:56.015 --> 00:58.006
All right, Mama.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.356
(Annie and Sonny)
J‘ Must have been a VIP

01:04.482 --> 01:06.939
J‘ For the second line is wild

01:07.068 --> 01:09.650
J‘ The CBD, Bourbon Street

01:09.779 --> 01:12.145
J‘ Cable and Ursuline

01:12.281 --> 01:14.943
J‘ You can join on any corner

01:15.076 --> 01:17.237
J‘ Enjoy it as it pass

01:17.370 --> 01:20.203
J‘ It's the second line on Monday

01:20.331 --> 01:23.073
J‘ And boy, the crowd is fast

01:23.209 --> 01:28.044
J‘ Oh, over in the...
J‘ Glory land

01:28.172 --> 01:33.462
J‘ He's gone to meet the holy man

01:33.594 --> 01:37.633
J‘ Over in the glory land

01:38.724 --> 01:41.841
J‘ Yeah, sadness on the rise

01:49.610 --> 01:51.942
J‘ Second line's in order

01:52.071 --> 01:54.608
J‘ They'll be dancing all the way

01:54.740 --> 01:57.277
J‘ When the preacher cut loose the body

01:57.410 --> 01:59.571
J‘ And the band begins to play J‘

02:21.100 --> 02:23.967
— Y'all sound fantastic together.
- Thank you.

02:24.103 --> 02:25.843
| used to hear that tune on OZ.

02:25.980 --> 02:27.971
Yeah, it's Chuck Carbo. You from here?

02:28.107 --> 02:30.143
Lakeview.

02:30.276 --> 02:32.312
Lost my house.

02:32.445 --> 02:35.357
Three of my neighbors
drowned on my block.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.606
Uh, been living in St. Louis with my in—laws.

02:41.078 --> 02:44.070
But I'm home for Mardi Gras, baby, huh?

02:44.206 --> 02:45.912
(Voice breaking) Home for Mardi Gras.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.329
Happy Mardi Gras, honey.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.054
Two days to get a fuckin' phone call.

04:30.187 --> 04:33.600
- Two days.
— You hit that cop, right?

04:33.732 --> 04:36.895
You were all in his face.
What he supposed to do, ignore it?

04:38.946 --> 04:41.232
(Laughs)

04:43.033 --> 04:45.024
I appreciate you coming down.

04:47.413 --> 04:50.029
- Talk to that lawyer?
— Bail hearing tomorrow afternoon.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.782
— Be home before dinner.
— A lot to do before Tuesday.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.707
You're still gonna mask?

04:59.091 --> 05:02.254
Never mind.
I heard you twice the first time.

05:03.929 --> 05:05.920
Now do me a favor.

05:06.056 --> 05:09.264
Go down to Poke's,
and tell 'em "keep sewing."

05:16.984 --> 05:21.694
Bro, if you'd taken Jefferson Highway
to Magazine to get into town like I told you,

05:21.822 --> 05:24.985
- it woulda been cheaper.
— You're killing me, dawg. 28 on the meter.

05:25.117 --> 05:29.076
I'm good for it, man. Just pick me up at two right here,
baby, take me home.

05:29.205 --> 05:31.321
And you owe me six
from the last time I picked you up.

05:31.457 --> 05:34.870
- (Laughing)
— Ha ha! You think | forgot?

05:35.002 --> 05:37.334
- (Laughing)
— (Chuckles) Yeah!

05:37.463 --> 05:39.419
No, man, no, no. I got you, baby.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.664
— I got you.
- All right.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.336
— Two o'clock, now.
- All right.

05:43.469 --> 05:45.460
— Two.
- OK.

05:48.641 --> 05:51.223
You know my dad.
He ain't leaving Valence Street, ever.

05:51.352 --> 05:53.343
I heard Cyril was in Austin.

05:53.479 --> 05:56.346
— And Aaron's in Nashville.
— Oh, there he is!

05:56.482 --> 05:59.098
— Hey, man, what's happening?
— lvan.

05:59.235 --> 06:02.648
— Your daddy coming back?
— Not till the air gets better, man.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.271
— He got that asthma thing.
— Aw, man, I hope they do.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.022
New Orleans without the Nevilles?

06:07.159 --> 06:09.445
— Got two Nevilles right here.
- True dat.

06:09.578 --> 06:13.162
- You working on Mardi Gras?
— Oh, uh—uh. I do not work on Mardi Gras day.

06:13.290 --> 06:16.202
Oh, no, no. Under no circumstances. Especially this one.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.576
— People coming home for this.
- You're right.

06:18.712 --> 06:21.454
— No doubt, man. Let's do this, bro.
— All right, bro.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.546
(Crowd whooping, cheering)

06:27.429 --> 06:29.385
We're Dumpstaphunk,
and we back in the NOLA.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.562
J‘ Baby girl

06:55.291 --> 06:57.907
J‘ They actin' the fool on Capitol Hill

06:58.043 --> 07:01.001
J‘ Bombs over Baghdad, business as usual

07:01.130 --> 07:03.837
J‘ A single battle can't pay the bill

07:03.966 --> 07:06.924
J‘ Some American Idol
singin' We The Beautiful

07:07.052 --> 07:10.840
J‘ Meanwhile
J‘ Six months since Katrina hit

07:10.973 --> 07:13.715
J‘ I still ain't got my FEMA check

07:13.851 --> 07:16.012
J‘ Got a trailer, no electric

07:16.145 --> 07:18.807
J‘ And I can't seem to find my keys

07:18.939 --> 07:20.804
J‘ Meanwhile

07:20.941 --> 07:23.648
J‘ You might as well have a good time

07:25.279 --> 07:27.019
J‘ Meanwhile

07:27.156 --> 07:31.616
J‘ Gonna shake your pretty booty, baby

07:31.744 --> 07:33.280
J‘ Meanwhile

07:33.412 --> 07:36.449
J‘ 'Cause there might not be a next time

07:37.791 --> 07:39.247
J‘ Meanwhile...

07:51.013 --> 07:52.423
Hey, honey.

07:53.057 --> 07:55.218
When's Daddy moving back in?

07:55.351 --> 07:57.512
When he finishes what he's writing.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.393
He seems so bummed.

08:01.273 --> 08:03.104
Mardi Gras always cheers him up.

08:08.489 --> 08:12.698
(Janette) Thank you for yesterday.
That was nice. I needed a real day off.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.203
Yeah, that's pretty much
a normal day for me.

08:15.329 --> 08:16.910
(Laughs) I know.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.872
That's the problem with New Orleans.
Too many people live like you.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.458
Au contraire. Not enough people do.

08:24.546 --> 08:28.209
- Speaking of work, I gotta go.
— Uh, do you need help tomorrow?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.173
— I already asked Jacques.
— Aw.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.011
I know you mean it,
but asking you to work Mardi Gras,

08:34.139 --> 08:39.008
that's like asking Paul Prudhomme
not to use fat, salt and cayenne pepper.

08:39.144 --> 08:43.228
You know, I gotta say this.
I'm concerned about your eternal soul.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.356
I'm not positive,

08:46.485 --> 08:49.693
but it may be a mortal sin
to work Mardi Gras.

08:49.822 --> 08:52.279
Just the morning.

08:52.408 --> 08:55.150
That would be venial.
All right, ten Hail Marys.

08:55.285 --> 08:58.413
Go forth, my child, and sin no more.

08:58.539 --> 09:00.325
— Have a good one.
- Yep.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.164
— (Starts engine)
— Maybe we'll run into each other.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.419
— Fuck off.
— Yeah.

09:04.545 --> 09:06.536
(Both laugh)

09:12.511 --> 09:14.126
(Ticking)

09:14.263 --> 09:16.879
- (Sighs)
— Any minute, Mama.

09:17.015 --> 09:20.553
Shoulda put the gumbo on,
but I can't till they get here.

09:20.686 --> 09:24.053
Once I get started with that roux, I'm stuck.

09:24.189 --> 09:27.397
You don't need to be standing
over a stove all morning.

09:27.526 --> 09:29.858
— (Chuckles)
— Just let me help you out here.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.773
- (Snorts)
— (Doorbell rings)

09:31.905 --> 09:34.237
— They're here.
- (Both giggle)

09:34.366 --> 09:37.028
- Hey!
— Mommy!

09:37.161 --> 09:39.243
— Hey, baby!
- Grandma!

09:39.371 --> 09:41.407
Hey, mother—in—law.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.405
— How are you doing?
— Mm.

09:44.543 --> 09:48.786
— Come on in the kitchen. You hungry?
- We're always hungry, Grandma.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.715
You OK?

09:54.887 --> 09:56.252
I'm fine.

09:56.388 --> 09:58.595
— How was the drive?
- Well, no traffic.

09:58.724 --> 10:00.885
— Come get something to eat.
- All right.

10:03.353 --> 10:06.140
- Morning.
— Hey, stranger.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.935
— Or is it afternoon?
- Just barely.

10:09.067 --> 10:13.106
— Looking for some lunch?
— I'm good. What are you working on?

10:13.238 --> 10:16.321
Oh, the next step. A proper autopsy.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.658
— I thought that was on hold.
— Oh, yeah, until after the holiday.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.903
The family can't focus right now.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.787
How's it going?

10:24.917 --> 10:27.533
— I'm seeing light at the end of the tunnel.
— Oh, that's great.

10:27.669 --> 10:30.911
As long as it's not the proverbial
oncoming high-speed light rail.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.049
- Daddy!
— True about absence and a fonder heart.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.258
— Hi, sweet pea.
— Hey.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.515
— Sure you don't want some lunch?
— l was gonna take a ride.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.802
Clear my head, get a coffee.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.891
Can I come?

10:45.020 --> 10:47.181
- Please?
— Yeah, sure.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.305
Let's go.

10:52.945 --> 10:54.105
(Ringing)

10:57.866 --> 11:00.482
— Mr. Foster.
— Hey, Delmond.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.530
Listen, I'm sorry to tell you this.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.496
The hearing's been postponed now
till Wednesday.

11:05.624 --> 11:08.036
Aw, fuck. You can't be serious.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.625
I don't know exactly
what's going on down there.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.995
I do. They're sending him a message.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.508
— I suppose they are.
— Bet your ass.

11:15.634 --> 11:19.468
You keep a Big Chief locked up
on Mardi Gras day, that's a message.

11:19.596 --> 11:22.929
— I don't know if you can change your plans...
— I guess I have to.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.516
All right. Sorry about this, man.
Have a good Mardi Gras.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.181
Yeah, I'll see you Wednesday.

11:28.313 --> 11:30.474
All right, I'll see you then.

11:33.402 --> 11:35.734
Anything else I can get you?

11:35.863 --> 11:38.855
- A hotel room.
— Good luck with that, brother.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.320
It's like seeing an ancient ruin.

11:48.876 --> 11:51.333
That's where Jaeger's used to be.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.543
Fitzgerald's.

11:53.672 --> 11:55.788
Bruning's, both of 'em.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.373
The new one and the original,

11:58.510 --> 12:00.796
which was wrecked by Hurricane Georges.

12:01.763 --> 12:03.970
The third oldest restaurant in the city

12:04.099 --> 12:07.933
after Antoine's and Tujague's, 1859.

12:08.061 --> 12:12.555
Back in the day it was a cabaret.
They had slot machines, dancing girls.

12:12.691 --> 12:14.477
All kinds of mischief.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.357
Over there, that was a footbridge
to the Bruning home,

12:19.489 --> 12:21.150
the one they used in The Big Easy.

12:21.283 --> 12:24.366
- Hey, Cher?
— Fais do—do, baby.

12:24.494 --> 12:26.075
And then also over to Sid—Mar's.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.365
Where was Sid—Mar's?

12:28.498 --> 12:30.580
See the pumping station?

12:30.709 --> 12:32.745
— Wow.
— Gone.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.414
(Sighs)

12:34.546 --> 12:36.537
Like it never existed.

12:37.883 --> 12:40.545
— It's really creepy.
— Yeah.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.544
It's good to get out and see the destruction.

12:45.307 --> 12:49.641
It's good. Get off the isle of denial
every once in a while

12:49.770 --> 12:52.637
and be reminded how much
of the city is still wrecked.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.480
- I know, but...
— Yeah, tomorrow, Fat Tuesday.

12:55.609 --> 12:57.145
You know the exact date?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.438
February 28th.

12:59.571 --> 13:02.904
Six months almost to the day.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.739
Six months.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.826
And we're gonna party like we know how,

13:07.955 --> 13:10.241
second—line like there's no tomorrow,

13:11.416 --> 13:15.284
Mardi Gras our asses off
in the ruins of the Crescent City.

13:17.005 --> 13:18.381
And we should.

13:19.758 --> 13:22.420
But it's good to keep this in mind too.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.962
I know.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.008
l'm bumming you out, aren't I?

13:31.144 --> 13:33.351
Kinda, yeah.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.562
Let's go catch a parade.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.649
Oh shit!

13:47.786 --> 13:50.072
— (Laughing)
— What the fuck?

13:50.205 --> 13:52.821
Y'all wanna see a grown man cry?

13:52.958 --> 13:54.914
That shit ain't funny, man.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.914
I'm afraid I got some bad news, y'all.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.627
(All groan)

14:03.635 --> 14:06.843
You sure you don't need a place to stay?
I got the room.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.714
Thanks, I got a friend in the Quarter.
I can stay with him.

14:09.850 --> 14:11.465
Tell your father I'm thinking of him.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.058
Wish I could.
I won't see him till Wednesday either.

14:14.187 --> 14:17.805
I hate to think of him all alone on Mardi Gras, of all days.

14:18.650 --> 14:21.027
It is his sacred holiday, all right.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.018
— Not you?
— To be honest,

14:23.155 --> 14:25.646
in my opinion,
New Orleans better off without it.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.613
— Really?
— Why not put all that time,

14:27.743 --> 14:30.200
energy and money into fixing up the place?

14:31.121 --> 14:33.703
Well, excuse me.
I got a little more work to do.

14:33.832 --> 14:36.448
St. Joseph's less than three weeks away.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.329
Right.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.290
(Music playing)

15:04.696 --> 15:06.732
(Crowd cheering)

15:06.865 --> 15:08.571
Leon "Kid Chocolate" Brown!

15:09.534 --> 15:12.276
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.788
My name is Bob French.

15:13.914 --> 15:16.326
We gonna take a slight pause
for a very worthy cause.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.074
We'll be back in a little bit.
Don't you go nowhere, hear?

15:19.211 --> 15:20.667
(Crowd) Yeah!

15:23.256 --> 15:25.247
Al Johnson. It must be carnival time.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.795
Antoine Batiste,
you tore it up, man, tore it up.

15:27.928 --> 15:30.590
— It's good to see you, man.
- Same here.

15:30.722 --> 15:33.930
— Awesome, Batiste. Just awesome.
— Thank you, man.

15:34.059 --> 15:35.890
— You good?
- I'm good.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.010
I'm better than good.

15:38.146 --> 15:39.761
— See you, man.
— All right.

15:41.983 --> 15:44.065
— Antoine Batiste?
— Whoa!

15:44.194 --> 15:46.480
Ho, ho! Mr. Toyama!

15:46.613 --> 15:49.275
— What you doing here?
- Mardi Gras.

15:49.407 --> 15:52.444
I thought this year, this would be the year.

15:52.577 --> 15:55.114
Yeah, it's good to see you.
It's good to see you.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.863
- Let me buy you a drink.
— It would be my honor to buy you a drink.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.786
Oh, no, God damn it.
I'm gonna buy you a drink, all right?

16:00.919 --> 16:03.877
— Take yes for an answer.
- I accept.

16:04.005 --> 16:05.506
— All right.
— Thank you.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.588
— Two Jameson and Cokes.
— You got it.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.753
A Mardi Gras drink. You'll like it.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.547
Milenberg Joys,
one of my favorite Jelly Roll Morton songs.

16:14.683 --> 16:15.798
Yeah?

16:15.934 --> 16:18.095
You know what Milneburg was, huh?

16:18.228 --> 16:20.970
The red—light district. Yeah, out by the lake.

16:21.106 --> 16:23.688
Before Storyville. Long gone now.

16:23.817 --> 16:26.559
Milenberg Joys. Original recording,

16:26.695 --> 16:29.858
New Orleans Rhythm Kings, 1923.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.855
George Brunies on trombone.

16:32.742 --> 16:34.903
All right, I'll take your word for it.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.287
(Both laugh)

16:38.165 --> 16:39.530
Cheers.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.282
— Happy Mardi Gras.
— Happy Mardi Gras.

16:46.590 --> 16:49.206
- Very sweet.
— That's why I like it.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.341
Now listen, uh...

16:52.470 --> 16:55.553
you may have noticed
I'm playing my old trombone.

16:55.682 --> 16:59.095
— Oh, please, no need to explain.
- No, it's an interesting story.

16:59.227 --> 17:02.264
See, I found my old one,
in a pawnshop, as a matter of fact.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.012
A pawnshop? Really?

17:04.149 --> 17:05.855
So I gave the one you bought me

17:05.984 --> 17:08.396
to my teacher, Danny Nelson.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.440
He lost all of his in the storm,

17:11.573 --> 17:15.816
including the 'bone Kid Ory gave him
when they were gigging on the West Coast...

17:15.952 --> 17:19.661
l was very sorry to hear
of Mr. Nelson's passing.

17:20.832 --> 17:24.165
- You heard?
— It was big news in Japan.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.034
Really?

17:26.171 --> 17:30.084
Well, among fans of traditional
New Orleans jazz music, yes.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.590
That's good to hear.

17:33.762 --> 17:34.717
Pfft!

17:34.846 --> 17:37.713
'Cause it should have been bigger news here.

17:37.849 --> 17:39.635
- Hm.
— So, anyway,

17:39.768 --> 17:42.384
it was passed on...
to his grandson.

17:43.230 --> 17:45.266
That's how we do it in New Orleans,

17:45.398 --> 17:47.684
how a tradition lives on.

17:48.818 --> 17:50.945
— Very Japanese.
- No kidding?

17:51.071 --> 17:52.686
Grandfather to grandson.

17:53.615 --> 17:56.197
That pleases me very much.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.153
To Danny Nelson.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.279
(Slaps bar)

18:03.416 --> 18:05.247
To Danny Nelson.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.504
- Good parade, sweetie?
— I love the night parades.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.125
Momus, that was my favorite night parade. You're too
young to remember.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.173
You were about two
when they stopped rolling.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.889
Momus, the god of mockery.
The parades were political, satirical...

18:21.017 --> 18:24.430
I can't believe you're waxing nostalgic
about the Knights of Momus.

18:24.562 --> 18:26.848
Masked riders on horseback
with pointy hoods?

18:26.982 --> 18:29.143
— Hello?
— The parades were beautiful.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.641
The floats, the flambeaux.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.143
Black men carrying flaming propane torches

18:33.280 --> 18:35.862
and scrambling for change
tossed in the street.

18:35.991 --> 18:39.279
It had its antebellum aspects, I'll admit.
That's part of Carnival.

18:39.411 --> 18:41.572
I hate the flambeaux
and the hooded masked riders.

18:41.705 --> 18:43.696
| wish they'd do away with all that.

18:43.832 --> 18:46.118
I wouldn't miss
the old line Carnival stuff at all.

18:46.251 --> 18:48.287
— I would.
— That's 'cause you're not from here.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.628
When you grow up with it,
it has a whole other meaning.

18:51.756 --> 18:55.214
Sometimes they throw
the baby out with the king cake.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.254
I like Endymion. That's my favorite.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.127
(Fakes choking)

18:59.264 --> 19:00.800
Super Krewes!

19:00.932 --> 19:03.514
B—list celebrities, tons of plastic beads.

19:03.643 --> 19:08.137
Like everything else in American culture —
cheap, mass-produced, made in China.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.434
Well, thanks for raining on my parade.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.182
You're welcome. Mwah.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.684
— Good night, honey.
— Night.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.811
— Night, Mama.
- Night night.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.114
I've gotta go to bed too.

19:20.243 --> 19:22.700
Don't you stay up too late.

19:22.829 --> 19:24.330
— Big day tomorrow.
- Don't I know it?

19:24.456 --> 19:26.071
Mm—hm.

19:49.230 --> 19:52.643
— Where are you going?
— lt's Mardi Gras, darling.

19:53.276 --> 19:56.814
I know. I thought we were spending
the day together.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.897
You know, I think I need a day apart.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.743
Like the Rebirth says...
J‘ Do whatcha wanna J‘

20:04.871 --> 20:07.157
That's what today's all about, right?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.247
You just wanna get high.

20:13.380 --> 20:15.587
That's what you wanna do.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.595
Be good...or don't.

20:27.602 --> 20:29.433
Fucking asshole.

20:36.236 --> 20:39.228
(J‘ Professor Longhair: Go To The Mardi Gras)

20:39.364 --> 20:41.571
This should be our national anthem.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.655
Sounds kinda like a national anthem.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.902
Bobby Short said Satin Doll
should be our national anthem.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.619
Oh, what does he know?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.660
l'd cast a vote for It Ain't Necessarily So.

20:51.793 --> 20:53.374
That'd be my second choice.

20:56.506 --> 20:57.996
Well, let's go.

20:58.133 --> 21:01.500
— You gonna turn that off?
— No, no, no. It's bad luck to turn it off.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.922
It's on repeat.
lt'll stay on till we get home.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.137
- Hup-hup.
— Whoo—hoo!

21:06.224 --> 21:08.715
Whoo—hoo! Come on, y'all!

21:09.561 --> 21:11.768
— Bye, Grandma.
— Bye, Grandma.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.636
Bye. (Chuckles)

21:13.773 --> 21:16.936
— Y'all have fun.
— Man, | wish you were coming, Grandma.

21:17.068 --> 21:20.435
— Oh, baby, Grandma too old for the parades.
— No, you're not.

21:20.572 --> 21:23.405
Tell you what, maybe I'll go next Mardi Gras,

21:23.533 --> 21:26.115
— when we're all together again.
— All right!

21:26.244 --> 21:29.236
(Larry) We'll be back for that gumbo.
(Mrs. Brooks) Have a blessed day.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.112
Later, Grandma.

21:39.591 --> 21:40.922
(Clatters)

21:47.932 --> 21:50.799
Get out ofjail free card, yes.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.021
(Shower running)

22:56.000 --> 22:59.367
— Happy Mardi Gras, baby.
— Aw, thank you, baby.

22:59.504 --> 23:01.995
— I hope this is a good spot.
— It's where we always come.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.873
Yeah, but with Zulu not rolling
all the way up this year...

23:05.009 --> 23:06.465
Folks will be here, you'll see.

23:06.594 --> 23:09.131
Driving up from Florida, Texas.

23:09.264 --> 23:12.301
— Yeah, you're right.
— (Both laughing)

23:12.433 --> 23:14.719
Give me one more. Mwah!

23:14.852 --> 23:18.470
— Happy Mardi Gras.
— Happy Mardi Gras, baby. That's how we do it.

23:36.666 --> 23:38.076
(Crowd shouting)

23:51.973 --> 23:53.429
(Cheering)

24:56.996 --> 24:59.954
— Mm, Davis!
— Daddy!

25:00.083 --> 25:02.950
- Happy Mardi Gras, y'all.
— How about a bloody Mary?

25:03.086 --> 25:07.079
— Is the sun over the yardarm?
— Ooh, I think it is, Captain Hook.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.206
No, Jean Lafitte!

25:09.342 --> 25:11.754
Ooh, you are such a hypocrite.

25:11.886 --> 25:13.842
Lafitte was a slave—trader, you know.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.347
— He was?
— Mm—hm.

25:15.473 --> 25:16.838
— He was not.
— He was.

25:16.974 --> 25:18.180
— He was?
- (Grunts)

25:18.309 --> 25:20.516
Oh well, I'll do my research next time.

25:20.645 --> 25:23.136
Besides, I prefer to emphasize his role

25:23.272 --> 25:26.014
— in the Battle of New Orleans.
— Oh, that's convenient.

25:26.150 --> 25:28.892
J‘ In 1814 we took a little trip

25:29.028 --> 25:31.519
J‘ Along with Colonel Jackson
down the mighty Mississip

25:31.656 --> 25:33.692
J‘ We took a little bacon
and we took a little beans

25:33.825 --> 25:35.361
J‘ And we caught the bloody British

25:35.493 --> 25:36.858
J‘ In the town of New Orleans

25:36.994 --> 25:39.701
J‘ Well, we fired our guns

25:39.831 --> 25:41.196
J‘ And the British kept a—comin'

25:41.332 --> 25:43.789
J‘ There wasn't nigh as many
as there was a while ago

25:43.918 --> 25:46.580
J‘ We fired once more
and they began to runnin'

25:46.713 --> 25:49.546
J‘ On down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico J‘

25:49.674 --> 25:51.210
- Whoo!
— (Cheering)

25:51.342 --> 25:54.880
- Yeah!
— | always liked that verse about the alligator.

25:55.012 --> 25:56.388
How's that go?

25:56.514 --> 25:59.472
Gator lost his mind, powder up his ass.

25:59.600 --> 26:01.136
- Mimi!
— Close enough.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.884
Spare us, Mimi. Spare us.

26:03.020 --> 26:04.681
Are you staying for Rex, darling?

26:04.814 --> 26:07.271
| just stopped by to use the facilities.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.563
- You know what they say...
— Ain't no place to pee on Mardi Gras day.

26:10.695 --> 26:14.279
"But, ossifer, I thought the sign
said Facilities Street."

26:14.407 --> 26:16.944
— Now that's funny!
- Still?

26:17.076 --> 26:19.909
Oh my God! McAlarys.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.164
l rue the day I married into this family.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.451
- (All) Aw!
— Y'all are incorrigible.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.417
The same jokes every year
and they don't get better with age.

26:27.545 --> 26:29.410
— Beautiful day though, huh?
- Perfect.

26:29.547 --> 26:32.505
- Zulu was out of sight.
— They were tremendous as usual.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.498
— I love Zulu.
— I know you do, Mother.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.593
— It's one of your redeeming characteristics.
— I got a coconut.

26:37.722 --> 26:40.088
— Don't you always?
- Pretty much.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.967
I'm serving a light buffet.
You sure you won't stay for Rex?

26:44.103 --> 26:46.094
Formaldehyde on wheels? No, thank you.

26:46.230 --> 26:50.348
Need to bop down to Frenchmen.
Later, gator. Be good, girls.

26:52.403 --> 26:55.361
J‘ And they ran through the briars
and they ran through the brambles

26:55.490 --> 26:58.607
J‘ And they ran through the bushes
where the rabbits couldn't go

26:58.743 --> 27:00.950
J‘ They ran so fast
that the hounds couldn't catch 'em

27:01.078 --> 27:04.206
J‘ Down the Mississippi
to the Gulf of Mexico J‘

27:04.332 --> 27:06.323
(All whooping)

27:08.169 --> 27:09.579
Two for five.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.378
That's 15.

27:15.092 --> 27:17.799
Hey! I like the blue tarp.

27:17.929 --> 27:19.635
Yeah, it's a theme this year.

27:19.764 --> 27:22.050
Oh, we heard about your restaurant.
So sorry.

27:22.183 --> 27:24.174
What you gonna do? Life goes on.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.676
— And it's a beautiful day.
- It certainly is.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.519
— What are you gonna have?
— What do you got?

27:28.648 --> 27:30.980
Chicken and andouille gumbo,
crawfish beignets.

27:31.108 --> 27:34.350
— Beignets sound like breakfast. I'll have those. — (Toni) Me
too. Sofia?

27:34.487 --> 27:36.227
- I'm good.
— You gotta eat.

27:36.364 --> 27:38.696
Three orders of beignets
in case she changes her mind.

27:38.825 --> 27:39.940
Coming right up.

27:49.335 --> 27:51.371
(Renee) Miss Brooks, right?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.711
Williams.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.798
I guess we, uh,
didn't ever exactly meet in court.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.463
Renee Dufossat.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.880
LaDonna.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.179
— What a day, huh?
- Whoo.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.768
I'm seeing so many people
I haven't seen since the storm.

28:09.897 --> 28:10.932
Me too.

28:11.065 --> 28:14.478
Just in for the day,
all the way from Houston, Atlanta...

28:14.610 --> 28:15.941
Uh—huh.

28:17.029 --> 28:21.193
Look, I hope you know,
in court we have to represent the office,

28:21.325 --> 28:24.988
- what it thinks is necessary.
— Just doing yourjob. Yeah, I know.

28:26.080 --> 28:28.696
Me, I'm glad the judge ruled the way he did.

28:29.250 --> 28:31.366
I hope you find your brother soon.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.876
— Happy Mardi Gras.
— Happy Mardi Gras.

28:35.006 --> 28:36.997
Jasmine! (Laughing)

28:41.888 --> 28:43.970
What a day, huh?

28:44.098 --> 28:45.838
You couldn't ask for better.

28:46.684 --> 28:48.766
ljust hate that we can't go up on Claiborne.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.102
They got all them flooded cars still there.

28:51.230 --> 28:53.516
They shoulda got them gone for today.

28:53.649 --> 28:58.313
— Antoine, l have to take the baby home.
- What, already? It ain't even noon.

28:58.446 --> 29:01.654
I thought we'd walk over
to the mother—in—law,

29:01.782 --> 29:03.397
maybe catch the Baby Dolls.

29:03.534 --> 29:05.399
Or Hunter's Field, see some lnjuns.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.276
— She won't last.
- Aw.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.404
l'll walk up to Galvez, call a cab.

29:09.540 --> 29:12.247
Well, all right. Here.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.832
I won't be late now.

29:13.961 --> 29:16.168
— Stay out as long as you want.
- What?

29:16.297 --> 29:19.414
lt's Mardi Gras. Go and have your fun.

29:19.550 --> 29:21.927
— You saying what I think you're saying?
- No!

29:22.053 --> 29:24.510
- (Laughs)
— Ha ha. Yeah.

29:24.639 --> 29:26.675
| just wanna know what the perimeters are.

29:26.807 --> 29:29.514
— You know damn well what the perimeters are. — All right.

29:29.644 --> 29:31.384
— You get home safe.
— You too.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.683
Bye, boo—boo.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.226
— (Horn honking)
- (Music plays)

29:58.422 --> 30:00.128
(Car horn honking)

30:03.177 --> 30:05.964
Why would anyone try to drive
on Mardi Gras day?

32:53.180 --> 32:57.674
Pete's not out, the crowds are small,

32:57.810 --> 32:59.675
The Buzzards are coming.

32:59.812 --> 33:02.770
I like the smaller crowds.
Not as many drunk college kids.

33:02.898 --> 33:06.061

l'll heat up the gumbo when we get home.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.340
It's not like your father to quit on Mardi Gras.

33:35.472 --> 33:37.804
Maybe he's coming down with something.

33:44.565 --> 33:48.649
Ah, a pirate wench! Just what I need!

33:48.777 --> 33:51.109

chopping my way out of my attic.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.699
No water.

36:44.828 --> 36:47.035
You took me off my rooftop.

36:47.164 --> 36:48.904
That was you, right?

36:49.041 --> 36:51.908
Lizardi Street? Yeah, it was.

36:52.044 --> 36:55.002
Oh, man, am I glad to see you.

37:30.833 --> 37:33.245
I didn't know he was your boyfriend.

37:34.962 --> 37:37.044
Where is he today?

37:37.172 --> 37:39.584
You know, Do Whatcha Wanna.

37:41.427 --> 37:44.260
I do know. I've been there, done that.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.049
You got a girlfriend?

37:53.355 --> 37:55.812
I'm not really sure, but...

37:59.570 --> 38:02.607

"FEMA says the beads will be here in April."

38:36.440 --> 38:39.432
By the time he came along in his boat,

38:39.568 --> 38:41.399
l was about ready to give up.

38:42.321 --> 38:44.312
If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here.

38:44.448 --> 38:46.530
— Is that right?
— I don't know. I guess.

38:46.658 --> 38:49.991

— You're right.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.671
Nice place.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.665
What, you're kidding, right?

39:05.802 --> 39:07.793
This place is a dump.

39:50.514 --> 39:51.720

Oh my God, oh my God. I'm gonna cry.

40:10.534 --> 40:14.573

40:14.705 --> 40:17.162

— Thank you.

41:10.844 --> 41:13.085
Y'all go on and eat without me.

41:14.306 --> 41:16.137

41:16.266 --> 41:18.473
No, Clarence left early.

41:18.602 --> 41:21.935

You'll really like him.
He writes for the Times—Picayune.

(Chuckles)

45:13.670 --> 45:15.706
Oh, damn, LaDonna.

45:17.173 --> 45:19.209
You're carrying it all right here.

45:24.890 --> 45:27.051
Let me work that out.

45:33.023 --> 45:35.014
Oh.

45:36.860 --> 45:38.851
(Cell phone ringing)

45:43.199 --> 45:44.860
(Ringing stops)

46:14.481 --> 46:17.063
— Oh, boy, that was fun.
- (Randy) Yeah.

46:18.318 --> 46:20.855
- Aw, man.
— I had a good time. Thank you.

46:20.987 --> 46:23.399
— You did?
- Yeah.

46:25.992 --> 46:27.948
Aw, what the hell?

46:39.923 --> 46:41.379
(Randy laughs)

46:47.555 --> 46:49.216
(Randy) Wow, that's mysterious.

46:49.349 --> 46:51.965
You have no idea.

46:53.853 --> 46:55.809
(J‘ Funk on stereo)

47:08.451 --> 47:10.612
No, baby. Hep C.

47:24.676 --> 47:26.667
(Helicopter overhead)

47:28.638 --> 47:30.674
So what do you say?

47:30.807 --> 47:32.798
More of where that came from?

47:43.862 --> 47:46.695
First let's fuck.

47:46.823 --> 47:48.814
Oh, baby.

47:57.292 --> 47:59.203
(J‘ Funk)

48:01.504 --> 48:03.369
— (Tune ends)
— All right. All right!

48:03.506 --> 48:05.212
Yeah! Thank you. Thank y'all.

48:05.341 --> 48:07.923
- Thank you so much.
— Y'all having a good Mardi Gras?

48:08.053 --> 48:09.884
(Crowd) Yeah!

48:10.013 --> 48:12.550
— How about you?
— Hell, yeah!

48:13.349 --> 48:15.010
Thanks for asking, bro.

48:16.186 --> 48:19.223
— Saw me some lndians tonight.
— (Crowd) Yeah!

48:19.355 --> 48:22.267
Forgot what a thrill that was, man.
I got goosebumps.

48:22.400 --> 48:24.106
- Yeah!
— I still got goosebumps.

48:24.235 --> 48:26.100
- Yeah!
— (Mouthing)

48:26.237 --> 48:27.773
lndians on Mardi Gras day, man.

48:27.906 --> 48:31.819
Kind of makes you think, uh,
New Orleans just might make it.

48:31.951 --> 48:33.737
(Man) Yeah.
(Delmond) You know?

48:33.870 --> 48:35.576
It might just come back.

48:35.705 --> 48:38.082
(Crowd) Yeah.
(Man) Right on.

48:38.208 --> 48:39.823
(Woman) Bring it back!

48:39.959 --> 48:41.950
- Right, Sam?
— You're right. You already know.

48:42.087 --> 48:44.123
Tell the people the name
of this next tune, bro.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.632
This next tune right here's
Come Down To New Orleans!

48:46.758 --> 48:48.248
— Yeah!
— (Crowd) Yeah!

48:48.384 --> 48:49.885
Desitively.

49:08.863 --> 49:11.525
J‘ When you wanna have a good time

49:11.658 --> 49:14.570
J‘ Come on down to New Orleans

49:15.120 --> 49:17.907
J‘ Come on down to New Orleans

49:18.289 --> 49:21.122
J‘ Come on down to New Orleans

49:21.251 --> 49:24.459
J‘ When you wanna have a good time

49:24.587 --> 49:26.873
J‘ Come on down to New Orleans

49:27.006 --> 49:28.837
J‘ It's the prettiest

49:28.967 --> 49:32.380
J‘ It's the prettiest little thing
you've ever seen...

49:32.512 --> 49:36.881
(Woman on TV) ..we will see the Captain
of Comus, the Mistick Krewe of Comus.

49:37.016 --> 49:40.474
And that's M—l—S—T—l—C—K, we should say.

49:40.603 --> 49:43.640
Lots of people put that Y in,
but you're not supposed to.

49:43.773 --> 49:47.607
(Man) ljust had a horrible thought about the Captain of
Comus getting stuck in the elevator.

49:47.735 --> 49:50.192
— We're on the fifth floor.
— There are escalators too.

49:50.321 --> 49:54.234
- If you'd still like to go to the store...
— Here we are, the Captain of Comus.

49:55.618 --> 49:58.155
That would put me to sleep too.

49:58.288 --> 50:00.153
(Whistle trills)

50:00.290 --> 50:02.997
(Announcer) The Captain
of the Mistick Krewe of Comus

50:03.126 --> 50:05.663
has arrived to present an invitation

50:05.795 --> 50:09.413
to His Majesty Rex to visit the Comus Ball.

50:09.924 --> 50:12.666
(Man over megaphone)
Mardi Gras 2006 is officially over.

50:12.802 --> 50:14.463
— Wow.
— Please clear the streets.

50:14.596 --> 50:17.258
(Annie) I've never seen anything like this.

50:17.390 --> 50:21.133
(Davis) It's one thing NOPD is good at.
Crowd control.

50:21.269 --> 50:23.476
The best in the world.

50:23.605 --> 50:26.563
At the stroke of midnight, it's over.

50:27.692 --> 50:32.402
(Policeman) Mardi Gras 2006 is officially over.
Please clear the streets.

50:32.530 --> 50:34.486
It's been wonderful.

50:35.658 --> 50:37.159
Thank you.

50:37.994 --> 50:39.655
Thank you.

50:39.787 --> 50:43.905
Mardi Gras 2006 is officially over.
Please clear the streets.

50:44.042 --> 50:45.623
(Davis) We should get going.

50:45.752 --> 50:47.208
(Man) Whoo!

50:48.087 --> 50:50.794
- My turn?
— Lead the way.

50:50.924 --> 50:53.791
Mardi Gras 2006 is officially over.

50:53.927 --> 50:55.007
(Murmuring)

50:56.304 --> 50:57.669
(Door opens)

51:00.516 --> 51:01.892
You still up?

51:02.018 --> 51:04.555
— You know I don't sleep.
— (Door closes)

51:04.687 --> 51:06.518
What time did Larry and the boys leave?

51:06.648 --> 51:10.812
About eight. He tried to call you, but...

51:12.862 --> 51:14.602
I must have been in the back.

51:15.531 --> 51:18.489
Been having trouble with my phone all day.

51:18.618 --> 51:21.030
- They OK?
— They're fine.

51:22.580 --> 51:25.322
Did you eat?
Plenty of gumbo left. I can heat it up.

51:25.458 --> 51:27.449
I'll do it. You've done enough, Mama.

51:28.753 --> 51:31.210
LaDonna, everything OK?

51:32.048 --> 51:34.630
— What do you mean?
— Between you and Larry.

51:34.759 --> 51:37.216
Everything's fine, Mama.

51:38.388 --> 51:39.468
All right.

51:40.723 --> 51:42.714
Everything's fine.

51:45.061 --> 51:46.926
(Music on stereo)

51:47.063 --> 51:49.975
J‘ It's sad but it's pretty like New Orleans

51:52.402 --> 51:55.485
J‘ I hate to see it come apart at the seams

51:57.490 --> 51:59.196
J‘ Is this love?

51:59.784 --> 52:01.285
J‘ This lonely love

52:02.620 --> 52:04.576
J‘ Is this love...

52:04.706 --> 52:07.948
"Sad but pretty like New Orleans.

52:08.084 --> 52:11.326
"Hate to see it come apart at the seams."

52:13.840 --> 52:15.546
Carnival's done.

52:15.675 --> 52:17.211
Farewell to flesh.

52:18.136 --> 52:20.172
In the land of dreams

52:21.306 --> 52:23.547
In the land of dreamy dreams

52:24.600 --> 52:28.092
Way down yonder, heaven on earth

52:28.229 --> 52:30.936
They called it New Orleans

52:32.191 --> 52:34.443
Living here now is like a dream,

52:36.070 --> 52:41.030
the way that everything in a dream
is the same yet not the same.

52:41.159 --> 52:43.241
Familiar yet strange.

52:44.620 --> 52:49.114
Not quite right,
but you just can't put your finger on it.

52:51.753 --> 52:54.085
New Orleans was a soap bubble.

52:55.882 --> 52:58.339
A soap bubble borne on a zephyr.

53:00.136 --> 53:02.297
And it had a hell of a run.

53:04.557 --> 53:05.967
But now it's done.

53:07.810 --> 53:10.301
Whatever comes next...

53:12.648 --> 53:15.185
is just a dream of what used to be.

53:33.878 --> 53:37.996
I wonder when they stopped
doing midnight Mass for Ash Wednesday.

53:38.132 --> 53:40.589
We could come back at seven am.

53:40.718 --> 53:43.004
Nah...| don't think so.

53:45.515 --> 53:47.506
All right, ready?

53:51.104 --> 53:53.220
There.

54:08.287 --> 54:09.788
What do you think?

54:12.041 --> 54:14.748
I think burned Gambit pages
work pretty well.

54:32.228 --> 54:34.219
(Coughing)

54:37.442 --> 54:40.934
What? I didn't give up weed for Lent.

54:41.070 --> 54:42.776
Oh, what did you give up?

54:43.990 --> 54:46.902
— I'll have to get back to you on that.
—(Laughs)

54:49.245 --> 54:51.236
What about you?

54:52.498 --> 54:55.990
I'm thinking about going home,
maybe, for a while.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.664
- Home?
— New York.

54:58.796 --> 55:01.833
Wow!
You're giving up New Orleans for Lent?

55:01.966 --> 55:04.252
— That's radical.
- (Chuckles)

55:04.385 --> 55:06.341
I don't know. Maybe.

55:10.725 --> 55:13.558
l'm anticipating munchies momentarily.

55:14.353 --> 55:15.729
Beignets?

55:17.023 --> 55:18.979
Beignet, done that.

55:19.108 --> 55:21.019
(Annie laughs)

56:04.987 --> 56:06.397
(Radio chatter)

56:10.743 --> 56:12.244
Well...

56:14.664 --> 56:16.154
Well...

56:36.894 --> 56:38.009
Good night.

56:40.356 --> 56:42.563
Good night, Davis.

56:52.827 --> 56:55.193
(Engine starts)

57:24.191 --> 57:25.226
Cray?

57:28.571 --> 57:29.902
Cray, wake up!

57:31.657 --> 57:35.115
Get up!
You want Sofia to find you like this?

57:37.246 --> 57:38.747
Pull yourself together.

58:00.269 --> 58:01.850
Remember that you are dust

58:01.979 --> 58:04.470
and to dust you shall return.

58:04.607 --> 58:06.598
Thank you.

58:12.615 --> 58:14.947
How was your Mardi Gras?

58:15.076 --> 58:18.034
It was good. It was real good, actually.

58:18.162 --> 58:19.993
It was a beautiful day.

58:20.122 --> 58:22.613
I met a girl, | sat in on a gig...

58:23.542 --> 58:25.533
and I saw some lndians.

58:25.670 --> 58:28.582
— Sounds a perfect day.
— It was.

58:28.714 --> 58:30.375
Sorry I missed it.

58:31.676 --> 58:34.634
— Which gang?
— Creole Osceola.

58:34.762 --> 58:37.378
— They pretty?
— Real pretty.

58:38.391 --> 58:41.633
Not as pretty as y'all would've been,
but pretty.

58:41.769 --> 58:44.226
St. Joseph's coming. You'll be out there.

58:44.355 --> 58:46.346
You'll be the prettiest.

58:48.317 --> 58:50.308
Yeah, you're right.

59:02.998 --> 59:05.284
(Door opens)

59:05.418 --> 59:07.409
Mrs. Williams.
