WEBVTT

00:01.088 --> 00:03.264
Previously on Van Helsing...

00:03.307 --> 00:04.482
Good evening,

00:04.526 --> 00:06.528
I'm Edward Hawkins,
and this is my wife.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.356
Lillian Van Helsing.

00:08.399 --> 00:11.489
Give this to our daughter
for safe keeping.

00:11.533 --> 00:12.664
That's so strange.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.449
She looks like
she died yesterday.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.538
These other elders,
tell me about them.

00:16.581 --> 00:18.844
There are others that guard
the pathway to the dark one.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.281
They have something.

00:20.324 --> 00:21.412
A totem.

00:21.456 --> 00:22.457
Is that right?

00:22.500 --> 00:23.458
Yes.

00:23.501 --> 00:24.328
My totem!

00:24.372 --> 00:25.634
Get back!

00:25.677 --> 00:26.548
Give it back to me.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.202
It's mine.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.334
She must have fought the B'ah
at some point in her short life.

00:30.378 --> 00:31.248
What's the B'ah?

00:31.292 --> 00:32.989
Oh, not what, but who.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.992
The B'ah is one of the great
elders you will face,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.690
and for that there is much
you don't understand.

00:38.734 --> 00:39.778
Then teach me.

00:39.822 --> 00:41.824
Better still I will show you.

01:18.034 --> 01:19.209
[faint clang]

01:21.211 --> 01:25.781
[distant fighting sounds]

01:49.239 --> 01:51.111
Damn robe!

01:54.331 --> 01:55.289
Wake me up!

01:55.332 --> 01:57.117
Please, Lady Van Helsing!

01:57.160 --> 01:58.466
Who is this, huh?

01:58.509 --> 01:59.989
Tired of pretending to be Susan?

02:00.032 --> 02:02.296
My lady, I- I was merely
unpacking your weapons-

02:02.339 --> 02:03.427
your trunk!

02:03.471 --> 02:05.473
Please don't strike me
with that vase!

02:05.516 --> 02:09.041
If you're not then how
do you know my name?

02:09.085 --> 02:11.261
I am your new servant,
my lady.

02:11.305 --> 02:13.350
Siobhan.

02:13.394 --> 02:16.701
Are you saying you don't
remember me, Miss Lily?

02:16.745 --> 02:17.789
What did you call me?

02:17.833 --> 02:18.964
Apologies, Lady Van Helsing,

02:19.008 --> 02:22.054
I should not address you
so informally.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.388
What have you done?

02:51.432 --> 02:52.737
I think the journey's left you
quite out of sorts, my lady.

02:52.781 --> 02:53.956
It's to be expected,
I suppose.

02:53.999 --> 02:56.393
I want this to end now.

02:56.437 --> 02:58.874
My lady, would you mind terribly
if I got up?

02:58.917 --> 03:01.311
I could fetch a tonic
to ease your anxiety.

03:22.332 --> 03:24.552
Where are we?

03:24.595 --> 03:26.206
When?

03:26.249 --> 03:28.947
We arrived in Hong Kong by
steamer just this morning.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.863
By now it must be uh,
quarter past two.

03:31.907 --> 03:33.865
The year.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.999
Should I send for a doctor,
my lady?

03:37.042 --> 03:38.043
If you don't mind me sayin',

03:38.087 --> 03:40.002
your behaviour is
quite peculiar.

03:40.045 --> 03:41.873
1896!

03:41.917 --> 03:43.658
June the 14th as I do recall.

03:43.701 --> 03:46.226
You're making me truly anxious.

04:11.207 --> 04:12.643
What colour is my hair?

04:12.687 --> 04:13.862
What do you see?

04:13.905 --> 04:17.518
Strawberry blonde,
like it's always been.

04:20.129 --> 04:23.611
If this is just a dream
then why am I her?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.396
Why here?

04:28.920 --> 04:30.879
This is my doing.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.707
You asked for a laudanum
to help you sleep,

04:32.750 --> 04:34.099
I must have mixed it
too strong

04:34.143 --> 04:37.146
and now it's caused you
these delusions.

04:39.931 --> 04:41.977
So I'm Lillian Van Helsing?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.674
Indeed, my lady.

04:43.718 --> 04:47.156
Proud granddaughter of
Abraham Van Helsing and...

04:47.199 --> 04:49.724
third generation vampire hunter.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.857
So this is... the elder,

04:52.901 --> 04:54.163
he said I had something
to learn.

04:54.206 --> 04:57.253
That the past informs
the future.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.863
No, but I couldn't
have travelled in time.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.083
The elder, is that one
of the vampires

05:01.126 --> 05:03.651
we're here to kill?

05:03.694 --> 05:05.392
Vampires? Here?

05:05.435 --> 05:07.698
Oh, it is coming back to you.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.961
That is why you brought
your weapons.

05:10.005 --> 05:11.354
You received a telegram.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.095
You told me to keep it a secret

05:13.138 --> 05:18.230
but I must say this is all
terribly exciting.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.145
Never had a job quite like it.

05:22.670 --> 05:26.543
Lily Van Helsing, 1896.

05:26.587 --> 05:28.893
China.

05:28.937 --> 05:31.592
Oh, thank goodness the fog's
clearing for you.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.289
Not a moment too soon.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.073
For what?

05:35.117 --> 05:37.641
Tea.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.164
With the governor's wife?

05:40.862 --> 05:50.872
[Chinese instrumental music]
â™ª

07:17.785 --> 07:18.960
Mrs. Fontleroy.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.528
What a great pleasure
to meet you.

07:21.571 --> 07:23.007
I am Agnes.

07:23.051 --> 07:25.793
May I call you Lily?

07:25.836 --> 07:27.185
Mmmhmm.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.797
I do apologize for requesting
you meet me here.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.799
A journey through the shanties
by rickshaw

07:31.842 --> 07:37.152
can leave one rather...
disoriented.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.023
But...

07:40.547 --> 07:43.941
To the matter at hand.

07:43.985 --> 07:49.947
I am here quite covertly at
the request of Master Tsui,

07:49.991 --> 07:53.951
a Chinese gentleman
who apparently has ominous

07:53.995 --> 07:57.955
and important things
to share with you.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.087
Why?

07:59.130 --> 08:01.829
Oh, come, my dear.

08:01.872 --> 08:05.572
We've never met but I do know
your secret.

08:05.615 --> 08:10.141
After all, my maiden name
is Seward.

08:10.185 --> 08:13.536
My father was a faithful servant
to your grandfather, Abraham,

08:13.580 --> 08:17.322
and although I've never
seen one myself

08:17.366 --> 08:19.542
I've heard many tales
of vampires

08:19.586 --> 08:22.371
and of your family's efforts
to purge them.

08:22.414 --> 08:25.330
When Master Tsui heard you were
due to arrive in Hong Kong

08:25.374 --> 08:27.245
he revealed to me quite
in confidence

08:27.289 --> 08:31.946
that he, too, knows of vampires.

08:31.989 --> 08:36.037
So they're here, even now.

08:36.080 --> 08:39.475
Perhaps this is where
they began.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.390
Maybe that's what I'm here
to find out.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.479
Recently there have been reports
of bodies

08:43.523 --> 08:46.438
drained of all their blood,
one found just this morning

08:46.482 --> 08:48.484
in an alley off the market.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.486
The locals assumed
it had something to do

08:50.530 --> 08:55.752
with botched attempts to cure
the outbreak of bubonic plague.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.014
Plague?

08:57.058 --> 09:01.758
Oh, surely you've heard
of it... in Chicago.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.847
Oh, terrible death toll.

09:03.891 --> 09:07.111
But with all the fatalities
it makes a perfect cover

09:07.155 --> 09:10.332
for the vampires to hide
their victims.

09:10.375 --> 09:11.986
Mmm.

09:15.729 --> 09:19.210
So where might I find
this Master Tsui?

09:19.254 --> 09:23.084
Well, he has a curious
little shop in Tai Ping Shan.

09:25.216 --> 09:28.045
You will find him here.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.878
Do you trust this Master Tsui?

09:34.922 --> 09:37.185
I don't trust anything.

09:37.228 --> 09:40.014
Yet, here I am.

09:40.057 --> 09:42.233
And what about these vampires?

09:42.277 --> 09:46.673
They're likely- different than
any you've encountered before.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.239
Yeah, I think that's
the whole point.

09:48.283 --> 09:51.286
It's- it's like the history of
vampires being played out

09:51.329 --> 09:52.374
in my subconscious.

09:52.417 --> 09:54.724
What, m'lady?

09:54.768 --> 09:56.770
Never mind.

10:07.041 --> 10:08.869
Once you're ready I should be
able to create

10:08.912 --> 10:11.132
a distraction that will allow
you to slip away.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.176
Slip away from what?

10:12.220 --> 10:16.528
From who, not what.

10:16.572 --> 10:18.269
Who the hell are you?

10:18.313 --> 10:21.011
I beg your pardon?

10:21.055 --> 10:22.012
Of course.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.361
Lillian was married.

10:23.405 --> 10:26.451
Why are you speaking
in third person?

10:26.495 --> 10:28.149
Are you feeling unwell again?

10:28.192 --> 10:29.280
It is my fault, sir.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.152
I gave m'lady some
sleeping medicine-

10:31.195 --> 10:34.329
I beg you, Siobhan, do not make
excuses for my wife.

10:34.372 --> 10:39.029
I distinctly overheard the two
of you discussing an escape.

10:39.073 --> 10:41.989
Does this have something
to do with vampires?

10:42.032 --> 10:43.425
What do you know about it?

10:43.468 --> 10:44.905
Other than this strange
delusion of yours

10:44.948 --> 10:46.297
that such things are real,

10:46.341 --> 10:48.952
flatly nothing, but I'd rather
thought you'd put

10:48.996 --> 10:52.216
these silly fancies behind you.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.002
We cannot afford a relapse,
Lily.

10:55.045 --> 10:58.353
I need you to maintain
a grasp on reality.

10:58.396 --> 10:59.746
You looked at me just now

10:59.789 --> 11:01.835
as though you'd never
laid eyes on me before.

11:01.878 --> 11:04.576
I'm feeling a little
disoriented.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.318
Well, then might I suggest
you take some time to recover,

11:07.362 --> 11:08.755
gather yourself.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.974
You're of no use to me
in a state like this.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.584
Use?

11:12.628 --> 11:15.892
We are having dinner
with Cyril Abernathy.

11:15.936 --> 11:19.504
The head of the East Asia
Trading Company.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.289
Sometimes I wonder
what gets into you,

11:21.332 --> 11:23.204
this headstrong nature.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.684
I had hoped it would be tamed.

11:24.727 --> 11:26.207
Tamed?

11:26.250 --> 11:27.251
Like an animal?

11:27.295 --> 11:28.296
[snickers]

11:29.645 --> 11:31.038
Please, Lily.

11:31.081 --> 11:33.693
Let us avoid the suffragette
debate again, shall we?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.523
I cannot have you embarrass
yourself or me

11:38.567 --> 11:41.178
with talk of vampires tonight.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.184
I think it'd be best for you
to remain here.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.666
As you wish.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.460
[laughing]

12:02.504 --> 12:03.766
I must say, Abernathy,

12:03.810 --> 12:05.855
I am rather looking forward
to this evening.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.117
Yes.

12:07.161 --> 12:11.600
Oh, is your wife
not coming with us?

12:11.643 --> 12:12.906
Unfortunately, no.

12:12.949 --> 12:14.908
She has been rather overwhelmed
by the journey.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.387
You know how fragile
women can be.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.519
Yes, indeed.

12:17.562 --> 12:18.563
Yes.

12:18.607 --> 12:19.782
Shall we?

12:19.826 --> 12:20.783
Yes.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.831
I see you.

13:08.875 --> 13:09.876
Come out.

13:13.401 --> 13:15.011
Madam Van Helsing.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.710
I've been expecting you.

13:18.754 --> 13:20.147
I am Master Tsui.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.891
Master Tsui.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.370
How do I know that's
who you really are?

13:26.414 --> 13:27.458
Mrs. Fontleroy.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.852
You received my message?

13:36.119 --> 13:37.599
That thing just disappeared.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.861
What was it?

13:38.905 --> 13:41.559
A Goeng Si, also known as
a shadow walker.

13:41.603 --> 13:43.213
Very dangerous.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.693
We should not linger here.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.738
More will come
with the darkness.

13:49.916 --> 13:52.962
So these shadow walkers
are servants to a B'ah?

13:53.006 --> 13:54.485
Yes.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.836
Ancient type of vampire.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.707
Very dangerous.

13:58.750 --> 14:02.189
They move faster than
the human eye can track.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.712
Hide in shadows.

14:03.755 --> 14:04.887
You said they've changed.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.671
How?

14:06.715 --> 14:10.414
Shadow walkers were rarely seen
inside the city.

14:10.458 --> 14:12.373
They kept mostly
to the countryside

14:12.416 --> 14:16.029
where it was easier to feed.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.857
Small villages.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.686
People disappear,
never investigated.

14:21.730 --> 14:24.341
But now they're in Hong Kong.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.821
Why?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.432
I believe it has something to do
with the outbreak.

14:28.476 --> 14:29.651
Bubonic plague.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.348
Yes.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.655
Tens of thousands dead.

14:33.698 --> 14:37.398
Mostly Chinese outside the city.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.923
If the illness spoils the blood-

14:40.967 --> 14:43.665
Then they'd risk coming into
the city for a clean supply.

14:43.708 --> 14:47.147
Exactly so.

14:47.190 --> 14:52.065
You Van Helsings have
superior instincts.

14:52.108 --> 14:53.588
What do you know
about my family?

14:53.631 --> 14:58.332
Only that you share
similar ambitions to my own.

14:58.375 --> 15:02.553
It is why I wanted us to meet.

15:02.597 --> 15:07.907
But now that you are here
I am concerned.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.561
You do not seem ready.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.955
This is starting to sound like
a bad Kung-Fu movie.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.739
What is a movie?

15:14.783 --> 15:16.350
It doesn't matter.

15:16.393 --> 15:18.700
What I really care about is
that spear you just picked up.

15:18.743 --> 15:21.921
Didn't think I'd notice?

15:21.964 --> 15:24.140
I was counting on it.

15:24.184 --> 15:25.925
So is that why I'm here?

15:25.968 --> 15:27.448
So you can train me up?

15:27.491 --> 15:31.669
And the idea of that amuses you?

15:31.713 --> 15:33.454
Actually, it's pretty insulting.

15:33.497 --> 15:36.718
[groans]

15:36.761 --> 15:39.286
Your fighting style is fuelled
by anger.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.244
Anger works.

15:41.288 --> 15:46.554
[grunts]

15:52.864 --> 15:55.998
Not if it blinds you
to your true purpose.

15:56.042 --> 16:01.612
Now, calm yourself
and we will begin again.

16:10.795 --> 16:11.796
Good.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.624
Good.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.235
Remain focused.

16:15.278 --> 16:17.367
Do not let your anger
consume you.

16:17.411 --> 16:18.586
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.849
Wax on, wax off, right?

16:20.892 --> 16:23.156
You like to speak in riddles,

16:23.199 --> 16:26.637
but they only mask
your uncertainty.

16:36.082 --> 16:39.650
[grunts]

16:49.182 --> 16:50.357
[click-click]

16:50.400 --> 16:52.315
Ahhhhh!!!

16:58.278 --> 17:03.413
I'm done with this,
sensei Yoda shit.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.242
You're lucky I didn't knock you
on your ass.

17:06.286 --> 17:09.854
But instead you controlled
your temper.

17:09.898 --> 17:12.292
Maybe you can be taught
after all.

17:14.642 --> 17:17.166
This taxes you.

17:17.210 --> 17:19.864
Perhaps a rest
will bring you clarity.

17:19.908 --> 17:20.909
Go.

17:20.952 --> 17:23.390
Please.

17:23.433 --> 17:28.917
The only clarity I need is where
the B'ah is so I can kill it.

17:32.747 --> 17:35.271
Or be killed.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.367
Thank my stars,
I was so worried!

17:44.411 --> 17:46.282
Lord Edward is on his way up.

17:46.326 --> 17:47.370
So?

17:47.414 --> 17:49.546
He can't see you like this.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.461
Help me get out
of these clothes.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.118
[knocking]

17:56.162 --> 17:59.426
Lillian, are you decent?

18:01.602 --> 18:03.604
Get the sword!
Get the sword!

18:06.172 --> 18:08.174
Did I wake you?

18:09.305 --> 18:11.742
Something terrible has happened.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.702
Come downstairs
when you're dressed.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.144
Cyril Abernathy's been murdered.

18:22.188 --> 18:23.232
It makes no sense.

18:23.276 --> 18:26.192
Why would anyone want
to kill him?

18:26.235 --> 18:28.107
Unless there was something
else you two were involved in.

18:28.150 --> 18:30.109
He was excited
about new clients.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.936
A large shipment
to the Americas.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.504
He wanted me to broker
the thing.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.115
Were you the last
person to see him alive?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.333
What is this?

18:37.377 --> 18:40.075
Interrogation by my own wife?

18:40.119 --> 18:43.383
I'm just trying to help.

18:43.426 --> 18:45.211
A little early, isn't it?

18:45.254 --> 18:46.560
My nerves are shattered.

18:46.603 --> 18:49.345
That's reason enough.

18:56.222 --> 18:59.834
What happened after you
and Abernathy parted ways?

18:59.877 --> 19:01.705
We finished dinner a little
after midnight,

19:01.749 --> 19:04.055
I took a rickshaw home.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.667
He insisted on walking,
damn fool.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.451
What about the police?
What're they saying?

19:08.495 --> 19:13.543
Wealthy westerner falls prey to
the murderous Chinese thieves.

19:13.587 --> 19:17.025
They ripped open his neck.

19:17.068 --> 19:18.853
Drained his blood?

19:18.896 --> 19:20.159
And what would you know of it?

19:20.202 --> 19:21.160
Or, allow me to guess.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.162
You suspect murder by vampire.

19:23.205 --> 19:25.468
Please spare me your
hysterical nonsense.

19:25.512 --> 19:27.253
This is a serious matter
you cannot fully comprehend.

19:27.296 --> 19:29.342
Try me.

19:29.385 --> 19:31.648
Let me look at your paperwork,
see if I can figure out

19:31.692 --> 19:32.823
who Abernathy-

19:32.867 --> 19:33.694
My god lady, who do
you think you are,

19:33.737 --> 19:34.738
Sherlock Holmes?

19:36.305 --> 19:37.306
You need to calm down.

19:37.350 --> 19:39.439
You need to know your place!

19:41.832 --> 19:44.444
I'll tie up my affairs

19:44.487 --> 19:47.403
and make arrangements for us
to travel home.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.377
You're right, my dear.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.423
This... this must be very
distressing for you.

20:07.467 --> 20:08.990
Quite.

20:09.033 --> 20:12.211
Why don't you have
another drink

20:12.254 --> 20:13.777
and a little lie down?

20:13.821 --> 20:14.691
No, but I must-

20:14.735 --> 20:15.736
I insist.

20:20.175 --> 20:25.180
Let me take care of you
the way any good wife would.

20:28.488 --> 20:30.490
Have Siobhan pack your things.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.143
I'll make arrangements,
book travel for us

20:32.187 --> 20:36.931
to get out of this godforsaken
place.

20:37.975 --> 20:39.847
Bottom's up.

20:48.638 --> 20:53.817
Thank you, Lily, dear,
for coming to your senses.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.211
You are...

20:58.126 --> 21:01.260
I think I'll have that lie down
after all.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.740
I'm- I'm not feeling
quite myself.

21:03.784 --> 21:06.569
That makes two of us.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.181
My goodness, my lady,
what have you done?

21:10.225 --> 21:12.227
I bought myself some time.

21:13.576 --> 21:18.407
I don't think that Abernathy's
death was a coincidence.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.757
It might even have something
to do with why I'm here.

21:20.801 --> 21:24.544
Here it is, East Asia
Trading Company.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.589
What are you up to?

22:08.501 --> 22:11.155
[fire crackling]

22:23.429 --> 22:24.995
[fighting grunts]

22:28.216 --> 22:31.088
Coming here was a mistake.

22:31.132 --> 22:32.829
Not my choice.

22:32.873 --> 22:34.962
I had to meet the B'ah.

22:35.005 --> 22:36.180
Now I have.

22:36.224 --> 22:38.226
You think that I am the B'ah?

22:40.359 --> 22:41.664
[fighting grunts]

22:48.367 --> 22:51.761
[fighting grunts]

22:55.112 --> 22:58.768
You are not worthy of our time.

22:58.812 --> 22:59.943
Why don't you take me to her?

22:59.987 --> 23:02.337
Let her decide.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.557
She has acquired a taste
for western blood,

23:04.600 --> 23:05.601
as have I.

23:05.645 --> 23:08.865
So what are you waiting for?

23:08.909 --> 23:10.258
You are not what you seem.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.651
No shit.

23:12.173 --> 23:14.741
[gasps]

23:14.784 --> 23:17.308
You can't defeat me.

23:17.352 --> 23:21.095
You cannot kill
what you cannot see.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.358
Then come out.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.534
As you wish.

23:25.578 --> 23:28.145
Strike where he is not.

23:32.889 --> 23:34.543
[groans]

23:41.898 --> 23:43.334
You are wounded.

23:43.378 --> 23:44.684
I'll heal.

23:44.727 --> 23:45.815
Only with stitches.

23:45.859 --> 23:47.077
What're you doing here?

23:47.121 --> 23:48.339
I was fortunate.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.037
Tracked Yang Shi.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.386
He lead me to this place.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.648
Yang Shi?

23:52.692 --> 23:54.607
Is that the name of the thing
I just killed?

23:54.650 --> 23:55.825
We killed.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.000
Yes.

23:57.044 --> 23:58.611
Second to the B'ah.

23:58.654 --> 23:59.525
Very-

23:59.568 --> 24:04.355
Dangerous? And also very dead.

24:04.399 --> 24:06.532
What was it doing?

24:06.575 --> 24:08.272
Burning all these papers?

24:08.316 --> 24:10.361
Covering tracks.

24:15.062 --> 24:18.282
East Asia Trading Company.

24:18.326 --> 24:20.502
What would a vampire care
about this for?

24:20.546 --> 24:22.591
They killed the man
in charge last night.

24:22.635 --> 24:25.899
Maybe they're involved
in something together.

24:25.942 --> 24:30.730
They care only for blood
and keeping themselves safe.

24:30.773 --> 24:33.210
What could a mortal provide
in that regard?

24:36.953 --> 24:39.521
You must tend to that injury.

24:39.565 --> 24:45.701
I told you, I'll... heal.

24:45.745 --> 24:47.529
I'm not healing.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.796
That's because I'm a--

24:53.840 --> 24:56.103
You are what?

24:56.146 --> 24:57.844
We need to find the B'ah.

24:57.887 --> 25:00.150
She's the answer to all this.

25:00.194 --> 25:01.935
I will find out what I can.

25:01.978 --> 25:04.503
Send word once I do.

25:04.546 --> 25:08.376
In the meanwhile, please.

25:11.031 --> 25:14.034
You are clearly blessed,
my lady.

25:14.077 --> 25:16.079
One inch to the left and it
would have cut the artery.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.385
I need to remember who I am.

25:17.428 --> 25:20.083
What my weaknesses are.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.436
I am a seamstress,
not a surgeon.

25:25.480 --> 25:28.091
I'll take another shot
of that whiskey.

25:36.578 --> 25:39.189
This all feels so real.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.888
The burn of the booze,
the sting of the wound.

25:41.931 --> 25:43.150
What do you mean?

25:43.193 --> 25:47.546
It is real and still bleeding.

25:47.589 --> 25:52.333
Just do it.

25:52.376 --> 25:55.205
I- I'm sorry.

25:55.249 --> 25:59.427
I've felt worse.

25:59.470 --> 26:05.085
If- if you don't mind me sayin',
m'lady...

26:05.128 --> 26:08.218
there's something about you
that's different.

26:08.262 --> 26:12.309
The way you talk,
the language you use.

26:12.353 --> 26:14.007
It seems as though
you are...

26:14.050 --> 26:17.750
Somebody else?

26:17.793 --> 26:21.144
Yeah, that might be close
to the truth.

26:21.188 --> 26:23.669
A vampire did this to you?

26:23.712 --> 26:26.367
Yeah.

26:26.410 --> 26:32.112
I must say, I'm-
I'm a little envious.

26:32.155 --> 26:33.374
Of getting hurt?

26:33.417 --> 26:35.768
No, no.

26:35.811 --> 26:38.118
The adventure of it all.

26:38.161 --> 26:41.512
The way you, as a woman,
are embracing danger.

26:41.556 --> 26:44.515
Fighting against evil.

26:44.559 --> 26:49.564
I wish I could know
what that felt like.

26:49.608 --> 26:56.266
One day, a long time from now,
women will have power.

26:56.310 --> 26:58.834
A voice.

26:58.878 --> 27:04.144
We'll chart our own courses
and make our own decisions.

27:04.187 --> 27:08.148
Really?

27:08.191 --> 27:10.019
When on earth will that be?

27:11.630 --> 27:13.327
What the devil is going on here?

27:13.370 --> 27:14.415
What happened to your neck?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.634
It's not what you think.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.505
Who did this to you?

27:18.811 --> 27:21.030
Have you been-

27:27.384 --> 27:29.648
Oh, this is so much worse
than I thought.

27:29.691 --> 27:30.649
You don't understand.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.999
Sadly, my dear, I think I do.

27:33.042 --> 27:34.783
The doctors warned me
of a relapse.

27:34.827 --> 27:35.697
Relapse?

27:35.741 --> 27:37.133
Of your psychosis, my dear.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.396
This desperate delusion
that affects you.

27:39.440 --> 27:40.615
And now, to make things
more real,

27:40.659 --> 27:42.617
you have hurt yourself.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.097
This is my fault.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.272
It's my fault.

27:45.315 --> 27:46.665
I never should have
brought you here.

27:46.708 --> 27:49.711
I need you to recover, Lily,

27:49.755 --> 27:53.672
so we can start a family
as we planned.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.238
I cannot lose you.

27:55.282 --> 27:59.721
Uh, there's um... there's
some things I need to explain.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.723
I'm not who you think I am.

28:01.767 --> 28:03.899
No, Lily.

28:03.943 --> 28:07.033
I cannot hear anymore.

28:07.076 --> 28:09.339
I blame you for keeping
the severity of this from me.

28:09.383 --> 28:10.601
For indulging my wife-

28:10.645 --> 28:11.385
Sir-

28:11.428 --> 28:12.995
Now, you listen to me!

28:13.039 --> 28:14.431
She is to be kept here until
our departure tomorrow morning.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.564
No more flights of fancy,
no more escapades,

28:16.607 --> 28:19.654
and no more sword,
is that clear?

28:19.698 --> 28:23.266
Anything else happens to her
and I will hold you responsible.

28:23.310 --> 28:24.615
Edward, wait.

28:24.659 --> 28:25.442
I-

28:25.486 --> 28:26.966
[slam]

28:35.888 --> 28:37.411
A message came, sir.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.935
For your wife.

28:45.854 --> 28:50.163
Whoever this Master Tsui is,
he's feeding my wife's delusion.

28:50.206 --> 28:52.643
I will put a stop to this
once and for all.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.733
Those women are not
to leave that bedroom

28:54.776 --> 28:56.996
under any circumstances,
understood?

28:57.039 --> 28:58.693
Yes, sir.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.271
I'll break the window.

29:11.314 --> 29:12.881
Mr. Edward has left a guard.

29:12.925 --> 29:14.535
He will surely hear.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.451
[sighs]

29:20.497 --> 29:22.804
Well, then let's give him
something to listen to.

29:37.906 --> 29:41.997
[muffled screams]

29:43.303 --> 29:46.175
[sobbing]

29:46.219 --> 29:48.961
[fighting grunts]

29:58.144 --> 29:59.841
[smashes vase]

30:02.801 --> 30:05.455
Edward!

30:05.499 --> 30:08.458
Siobhan, come on!

30:09.503 --> 30:11.897
I must say, this is all
so exciting!

30:11.940 --> 30:12.941
What now?

30:15.422 --> 30:18.120
If Edward read this he's getting
into something he can't handle.

30:18.164 --> 30:20.079
We should make chase before
anything unfortunate happens to-

30:20.122 --> 30:20.993
No, you're staying here.

30:21.036 --> 30:21.994
It's far too dangerous.

30:22.037 --> 30:23.256
Dangerous?

30:23.299 --> 30:25.084
Isn't that exactly what
Lord Edward would say?

30:25.127 --> 30:28.304
Such a frail and naive woman.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.698
Fine, but you're
staying outside.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.269
How can you be sure?

30:36.312 --> 30:37.705
Yang Shi.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.621
I examined his body more
carefully after you left.

30:40.664 --> 30:44.625
Black opium tar
underneath the fingernails.

30:44.668 --> 30:47.106
Stay here.

30:47.149 --> 30:49.282
This is what they have been
doing to feed in secrecy

30:49.325 --> 30:54.417
and darkness, luring victims
to them with the drugs.

30:54.461 --> 30:56.419
What about the other murders?

30:56.463 --> 31:00.249
That part I have
not yet uncovered.

31:00.293 --> 31:01.685
Something else.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.992
Edward, he intercepted the note
before I got it.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.428
Ah.

31:05.472 --> 31:09.128
I pray we are not too late.

31:09.171 --> 31:13.784
Now I fear my wife has gone
quite mad.

31:13.828 --> 31:17.353
Something to do
with a local gentleman.

31:17.397 --> 31:20.008
He directed her to here.

31:20.052 --> 31:24.360
I wonder if you might help me
to locate him.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.841
What is his name?

31:26.885 --> 31:32.020
I believe it is Master Tsui.

31:32.064 --> 31:36.155
I know him only too well.

31:36.198 --> 31:43.249
What is his connection
to your wife?

31:43.292 --> 31:49.820
I'm not really sure,
but I intend to find out.

31:49.864 --> 31:51.866
All her ramblings of vampires.

31:55.739 --> 31:58.133
What of them?

31:58.177 --> 32:03.269
I blame my wife's malady
on that wretched ancestry.

32:03.312 --> 32:06.750
Generations of delusion
passed down

32:06.794 --> 32:10.885
by those damned Van Helsings.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.938
If the B'ah can take any form
how do we know who it is?

32:24.551 --> 32:27.946
I feel we need look no further.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.996
East meets west.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.999
Two legacies of vampire killers.

32:38.043 --> 32:40.001
This should be quite a fight.

32:40.045 --> 32:41.437
You know who I am?

32:41.481 --> 32:46.355
I know of your kind,
spawn of Abraham.

32:46.399 --> 32:50.490
Years ago he nearly took
my head.

32:50.533 --> 32:52.666
And now here you are.

32:52.709 --> 32:54.668
Here to finish what he didn't.

32:57.627 --> 32:59.803
I doubt that.

32:59.847 --> 33:02.197
[gasps]

33:11.641 --> 33:14.253
Impressive for a mortal.

33:14.296 --> 33:17.299
I'm a little more than that.

33:19.823 --> 33:21.738
You bleed like a human.

33:21.782 --> 33:26.961
There is something different
about you.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.571
Why don't you come
a little closer?

33:28.615 --> 33:33.620
I think I will wait for the
poison to start to take effect.

33:33.663 --> 33:36.666
We are outnumbered and you're
in grave danger from the poison.

33:36.710 --> 33:37.580
We should retreat.

33:37.624 --> 33:42.629
Lily? What're you doing here?

33:46.111 --> 33:48.113
You run, he dies.

33:48.156 --> 33:49.244
Slowly.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.029
Unless you die first.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.422
We cannot save both him
and yourself.

33:53.466 --> 33:55.381
No, he doesn't die. He can't.

33:55.424 --> 33:57.513
Ten years from now he signs
Lily's committal papers

33:57.557 --> 33:59.124
to Renfield House.

33:59.167 --> 34:00.038
The poison.

34:00.081 --> 34:01.256
You are becoming delirious.

34:01.300 --> 34:02.779
There is only one cure.

34:02.823 --> 34:06.522
No, unless somehow him dying
wakes me from this dream.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.829
Dream?

34:08.872 --> 34:12.702
Then you, too,
are not really here?

34:12.746 --> 34:14.748
Are you someone else?

34:17.751 --> 34:21.537
This is a however created
by another elder.

34:21.581 --> 34:22.669
Why?

34:22.712 --> 34:25.106
So I could learn how
to destroy you.

34:27.587 --> 34:32.113
But if we die here what happens
to us in reality?

34:32.157 --> 34:35.073
Only one way to find out.

34:35.116 --> 34:37.988
No escape now.

34:43.429 --> 34:53.439
[fighting grunts]

35:18.986 --> 35:21.075
Do not let the rage consume you.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.250
Channel it.

35:22.294 --> 35:23.599
Control it.

35:23.643 --> 35:26.254
Only light can
drive out darkness.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.299
Light.

35:27.342 --> 35:28.256
Light.

35:28.300 --> 35:30.737
We need light.

35:34.262 --> 35:44.272
[fighting grunts]

36:33.669 --> 36:41.590
I am certain we will meet again, but next time not in dreams.

36:43.113 --> 36:44.114
Edward.

36:50.033 --> 36:53.211
How can such monsters
be real?

36:53.254 --> 36:55.300
The dark sleep.

36:55.343 --> 36:58.564
Her kind take it for hundreds
of years.

36:58.607 --> 37:00.653
That is why the shipping
company...

37:00.696 --> 37:02.220
Abernathy.

37:03.656 --> 37:05.310
She's trying to leave China.

37:05.353 --> 37:06.789
Some place safer
so she can return

37:06.833 --> 37:08.791
and hunt again in my time.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.967
I don't understand.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.274
But know this.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.363
[groans]

37:17.104 --> 37:23.023
Only the blood of the B'ah
can stop the poison.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.177
[groans]

38:03.803 --> 38:05.718
You are so much
more than I realized,

38:05.761 --> 38:08.677
Lily Van Helsing.

38:08.721 --> 38:12.464
I'm sorry I doubted you.

38:12.507 --> 38:15.641
From this day forth I swear
I will help you

38:15.684 --> 38:18.948
as much as I can.

38:24.127 --> 38:28.131
Rest now, you.

38:28.175 --> 38:31.570
[knocking]

38:35.095 --> 38:36.618
Did you find anything?

38:36.662 --> 38:39.969
My husband acquired the shipment
manifest for the harbour.

38:40.013 --> 38:43.799
Indeed there is a freighter
leaving this evening.

38:43.843 --> 38:48.761
A dozen unusual crates from
the East Asia Trading Company.

38:48.804 --> 38:50.806
Headed where?

38:50.850 --> 38:53.592
San Francisco.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.637
We have to stop that ship.

38:55.681 --> 39:00.990
I am afraid we are already
too late.

39:44.164 --> 39:48.734
You made it back.

39:48.777 --> 39:51.780
Not what you were expecting?

39:53.608 --> 39:55.305
How long was I gone for?

39:55.349 --> 39:57.699
A blink of an eye.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.919
That's not...

39:59.962 --> 40:01.311
But now you know.

40:01.355 --> 40:03.270
Did you see it?
The B'ah?

40:03.313 --> 40:05.228
It's totem?

40:05.272 --> 40:08.318
Did you claim it?

40:08.362 --> 40:11.800
Not exactly.

40:11.844 --> 40:15.108
But I know where it is.

40:15.151 --> 40:15.674
Let's go.

40:15.717 --> 40:16.718
Where?

40:18.720 --> 40:21.114
San Francisco.

40:21.157 --> 40:22.985
That's where it went
all these years ago.

40:23.029 --> 40:26.859
And what will you do
if you find it?

40:26.902 --> 40:29.165
You know what I'll do.

40:29.209 --> 40:31.733
But first, you.

40:31.777 --> 40:35.998
I'm gonna do what you asked.

40:36.042 --> 40:40.699
I'm gonna release you from your
obligation to the Van Helsings.

40:40.742 --> 40:43.484
You are too kind.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.964
And wise.

40:45.007 --> 40:46.182
Yes.

40:46.226 --> 40:47.836
Wise enough to know
that you were hoping

40:47.880 --> 40:50.143
I wouldn't return
from that vision.

40:50.186 --> 40:54.190
No, I... I was sworn to-

40:54.234 --> 40:55.801
Obey me, yes.

40:55.844 --> 41:00.501
Until I release you or I die.

41:00.545 --> 41:04.157
If you couldn't do it you
were hoping the B'ah could.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.816
My mother told me
to destroy these.

41:10.859 --> 41:14.733
No, you must not,
it's mine.

41:30.139 --> 41:33.578
The more elders there are the
greater chance I'll be betrayed.

41:33.621 --> 41:35.884
[grunt]

41:37.625 --> 41:39.279
I release you.
