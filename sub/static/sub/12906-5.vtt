another wonderful afternoon.

prima ballerina came out

10:06.636 --> 10:08.870
Well, if I were you,
I would go upstairs right now

10:08.906 --> 10:10.505

our little adventures.

from his window,

11:15.424 --> 11:16.490
I don't want to know that.

11:16.526 --> 11:18.726
Long story short, I got
roped into a date with Adrian,

11:18.761 --> 11:19.960
a one-time thing.

11:19.996 --> 11:21.829
Obviously, I'm not
interested in him.

I didn't say anything.

Because.

12:30.562 --> 12:32.028
Even Danni didn't know.

And when she found out, she...

12:33.998 --> 12:35.397
she ran away.

12:35.432 --> 12:37.499
But that's why
I needed to talk to you.

13:07.863 --> 13:10.897
You know how Ben was
always bringing you coffee?

13:10.933 --> 13:12.899
Mm-hmm, that's probably
how he drugged me.

13:12.935 --> 13:14.567
Exactly.

13:14.603 --> 13:17.504
So I was thinking if we can get
him to do it again,

13:17.539 --> 13:20.040
maybe we could catch him
in the act.

13:20.075 --> 13:21.942

18:09.776 --> 18:12.076
and... and you're there alone,
you'll be horribly embarrassed.

18:12.111 --> 18:14.111
Well, how very considerate.

18:14.147 --> 18:15.512
So you won't be attending?

18:15.547 --> 18:17.581
I will not.

18:17.616 --> 18:19.449
You have my word.
Mm.

[Laughing] Bartholomew.

18:27.525 --> 18:29.092
Fabian kissed me.

18:29.127 --> 18:31.694
Fabian your hairdresser?

18:31.729 --> 18:33.629
Square on the mouth.

18:33.665 --> 18:36.332
With lots of intention
and passion.

18:36.367 --> 18:38.367
Well, I'm confused.

18:38.403 --> 18:40.269
I-Isn't he gay?

18:40.304 --> 18:42.204
Apparently not all the way.

18:42.239 --> 18:44.539
He seemed all the way to me.

18:44.574 --> 18:47.276
Is it possible I'm so beautiful

18:47.311 --> 18:48.844
that I turned him straight?

18:48.879 --> 18:51.613
I don't think that happens.

18:51.648 --> 18:54.283
I always saw Fabian
as my fabulous friend.

18:54.318 --> 18:56.650
It never occurred to me
that he'd want more.

18:56.686 --> 18:58.719
I wouldn't worry about
what Fabian wants.

18:58.754 --> 19:00.688
Are <i> you</i> attracted to him?

19:00.723 --> 19:02.656
I don't think so.

19:02.692 --> 19:04.792
I mean, the kiss was enjoyable,

19:04.828 --> 19:08.462
but I think he was wearing
more lip gloss than I was.

19:08.497 --> 19:11.632
Then there you go.

19:17.272 --> 19:20.340
I just wanted to say goodbye.
I'm going back to the island.

19:32.419 --> 19:34.419
She meant what she said.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.661
All her life, I worried
that this would happen.

19:42.696 --> 19:44.563
That she'd find out.

19:46.700 --> 19:49.200
And that she would pick you
over me.

19:49.236 --> 19:50.768
She didn't pick me.

19:50.803 --> 19:52.503
Of course she did.

19:52.538 --> 19:53.838
Look at you.

19:53.874 --> 19:56.574
You were always
the pretty one...

19:56.609 --> 19:58.376
the talented one.

19:58.411 --> 20:00.444

20:05.384 --> 20:07.617
From the moment
she heard the truth,

20:07.652 --> 20:09.552
she cut me out of her life.

20:11.891 --> 20:14.191
Josefina,<i> espérate.</i>

You can't leave me
all alone with her.

20:17.562 --> 20:19.930

this will finally
make Daniela happy.

I drop by unannounced.

your phone number.

give it to you.

I've attended with my wife,

20:59.535 --> 21:02.336

"Why not enjoy myself?"

Would you move a little?
The sun's in my eyes.

21:04.606 --> 21:06.273

can be a bit tedious.

whale or manatee

21:18.853 --> 21:20.320

You're in an evening gown!
