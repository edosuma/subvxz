WEBVTT

00:06.644 --> 00:08.093
Previously on E.R.

00:08.095 --> 00:10.547
So the surgical sub-I is left open.

00:10.582 --> 00:12.621
- You want it or not?
- In the ER?

00:12.904 --> 00:15.195
- Yeah. I'm in a hurry. Yes or no?
- I got it?

00:15.792 --> 00:17.769
Yeah, I definitely want it.

00:19.700 --> 00:22.594
- You're gonna make a good doctor.
- Thanks.

00:23.253 --> 00:26.361
- I'm not strong enough, Susie.
- Chloe, you're doing great.

00:27.043 --> 00:30.077
I've decided to sign off on
you as attending for next year.

00:30.078 --> 00:31.211
You get my messages?

00:31.212 --> 00:33.677
Yeah. Sorry, I've been working a lot.

00:34.109 --> 00:36.825
And you really shouldn't
call me at home.

00:37.167 --> 00:40.832
"Welcome Back Carter!"

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.103 --> 01:37.510
Oh, my God!

01:37.605 --> 01:41.850
Help me!

01:45.943 --> 01:49.061
- Whoa! I got a pumper!
- He's gonna need an airway.

01:49.237 --> 01:52.438
- Stop moving around. Now!
- Scissors!

01:52.614 --> 01:56.823
- We got a pressure?
- 70/40. Pulse weak and thready at 150.

01:56.991 --> 02:00.359
Buddy, you see who shot you?
You get a plate number?

02:00.535 --> 02:02.491
He's not talking right now.

02:02.661 --> 02:06.029
Start the O-neg on an infuser.
Somebody find Lewis.

02:07.414 --> 02:09.453
- I feel the bullet.
- I don't wanna die.

02:09.624 --> 02:12.410
- You'll be fine. Let's get a head CT.
- Where's Lewis?

02:12.584 --> 02:17.291
- Please don't let me die.
- Tetanus booster and get Radiology.

02:17.712 --> 02:19.289
Jerry!

02:19.463 --> 02:23.246
- Jerry, have you seen Dr. Lewis?
- Curtain 3 with a heart attack.

02:26.926 --> 02:30.376
Get Benton. Pregnant woman
coming in, shot in the abdomen.

02:30.553 --> 02:32.877
- How far out?
- Two minutes or less.

02:33.055 --> 02:34.714
Got it.

02:35.556 --> 02:40.347
Your tests are normal, but your history
suggests the pain may be heart-related.

02:40.518 --> 02:43.268
Mark needs you.
Gunshot wound to the neck.

02:43.436 --> 02:45.593
- Does CCU have any beds?
- Still backed up.

02:45.771 --> 02:49.897
We have to hold you here until there's
a bed in the Cardiac Care Unit.

02:50.065 --> 02:52.733
Then we'll send you up
as soon as we can.

02:53.609 --> 02:56.099
Whoa, whoa! Go, go, go!

02:56.277 --> 02:59.645
BP is 90/60 and pulse is 120.

03:01.489 --> 03:05.532
She's full-term. I need a fetal monitor
and a doctor's scope.

03:06.783 --> 03:09.736
- Peter, are you okay?
- Watch the damn gurney. Damn!

03:09.910 --> 03:13.906
- Type and cross four units.
- Valenzala? With a "V" or a "B"?

03:14.079 --> 03:18.076
Get ultrasound. Do the paperwork later.
CBC, type and cross four units.

03:18.249 --> 03:22.115
- Is my baby all right?
- Uterus tender. No exit wound.

03:22.293 --> 03:24.201
Let's prep for a pelvic. Call OB.

03:25.503 --> 03:29.250
- We need a type and cross four units.
- Where's everybody?

03:29.422 --> 03:32.872
Twelve GSWs, four critical.
Glass is flying. It's a real mess.

03:33.049 --> 03:35.919
Pulse ox 95. BP 90/60. Pulse 120.

03:36.093 --> 03:37.717
- Two hours late.
- What?

03:37.886 --> 03:41.716
- Carter.
- I have to run the blood up myself.

03:41.888 --> 03:44.556
Not dilated. Vertex presentation.

03:44.723 --> 03:47.094
Fetal heart rate, 145. That's good.

03:47.266 --> 03:50.883
- Lydia, stay put. We need you.
- I'm not done next door.

03:51.060 --> 03:53.099
Where the hell is Carter?!

04:02.025 --> 04:03.816
Oh, God.

04:06.278 --> 04:07.985
Oh, God.

04:09.113 --> 04:12.196
- Oh, God! What is all this?
- Traffic.

04:12.365 --> 04:15.567
- Can't you do something?
- Like what?

04:18.577 --> 04:21.327
- Stop the cab.
- No problem.

04:22.287 --> 04:23.947
Keep the change.

04:48.386 --> 04:51.470
Oh, God. Oh, God.

05:40.042 --> 05:45.330
It hurts so bad. It started in the
store. My children... Grandchildren...

05:45.503 --> 05:49.369
Would you like to see pictures
of my grandchildren?

05:49.547 --> 05:52.915
I have four sons and three
grandchildren. Let me show you.

05:53.091 --> 05:56.126
- Here's Tony. Isn't he a darling?
- Yeah, I'll hold.

05:56.301 --> 05:58.210
- Excuse me.
- Here's Jeff and Harold.

05:58.386 --> 06:00.710
- Where the hell is Psych?
- They're all blond...

06:00.888 --> 06:03.378
- Excuse me.
- Hang on, will you, please?

06:07.141 --> 06:10.888
I miss them so much! I miss them!

06:11.060 --> 06:14.926
Dr. Lewis. Bipolar. I called Psych,
but something's wrong with her leg.

06:15.104 --> 06:18.686
Another gunshot coming in. Put her
on the board and hope Psych shows up.

06:18.857 --> 06:21.773
That son-of-a-bitch cardiologist!
My sister met the president...

06:21.942 --> 06:23.934
- Excuse me.
- What?!

06:24.110 --> 06:27.774
Thank you. We're the new third-year
students looking for Dr. Greene.

06:27.946 --> 06:29.523
- You're a med student?
- Yeah.

06:29.697 --> 06:33.029
- Anybody know how to take a history?
- Sure.

06:35.575 --> 06:37.899
- I was not a cat person...
- Mrs. Constantine?

06:38.077 --> 06:40.567
- This is...
- Harper. Harper Tracy.

06:40.745 --> 06:46.283
Harper? I played with someone called
Harper in the New York Philharmonic.

06:46.457 --> 06:50.073
- Go to Exam 2, right over there.
- He was just like Paul Newman.

06:50.292 --> 06:53.162
Do you like Paul Newman?
I love those blue eyes.

06:54.253 --> 06:57.621
- Hang two units. Where are you?
- Peter, what have you got?

06:57.797 --> 06:59.753
Full-term abdominal GSW,
no exit wound.

06:59.923 --> 07:02.330
Baby's moving. Bullet's in the uterus.

07:02.508 --> 07:05.923
- Sounds like a section.
- Fetal heart rate is falling, 100.

07:06.094 --> 07:09.793
- How is Mom?
- 80/50, pulse 140 and climbing.

07:09.971 --> 07:11.797
We're moving her now.

07:11.972 --> 07:16.134
Call the O.R. For an emergency
section and get OB.

07:16.308 --> 07:18.181
- Peter, what happened to you?
- Don't ask.

07:18.351 --> 07:21.683
- Can you handle this?
- Yeah, I'll just need to walk it out.

07:37.613 --> 07:38.987
Oh, no.

07:40.489 --> 07:42.944
GSW to the head. Two large-bore IVs.

07:43.116 --> 07:45.985
- Pressure's 60/40, bradycardic at 50.
- Trauma 1.

07:46.159 --> 07:48.116
- What happened?
- Gang fight. Nice shirt.

07:48.286 --> 07:50.954
- I'm a dead man.
- Hey, welcome back, Carter.

07:55.874 --> 07:58.790
- Dr. Carter, I presume?
- Great tan.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.793
Where's Dr. Benton,
and has he been asking about me?

08:01.961 --> 08:04.581
Once or twice.
He's doing a crash section.

08:04.754 --> 08:07.837
Pregnant woman got shot.
He just limped up.

08:08.756 --> 08:11.081
- Hi, Dr. Greene.
- Who is that?

08:11.258 --> 08:14.672
- Carter, I think. Dr. Benton's student.
- Tell him to slow down.

08:14.843 --> 08:18.840
I am on the phone with Cardiology
every day. They claim the CCU's full.

08:19.013 --> 08:22.878
I go up and there are empty beds.
We had a rule-out MI here for two days.

08:23.057 --> 08:26.010
You're an Attending now. Got a
problem with another department...

08:26.184 --> 08:29.136
...you solve it. And you've got
new third-years coming in today.

08:29.311 --> 08:31.302
- Today?
- Four of them, bright-eyed.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.265
Staff meeting at 4:00. Don't forget.

08:35.063 --> 08:38.063
- Forget what?
- My first staff meeting's today.

08:38.232 --> 08:39.975
Little boss, what did big boss want?

08:40.150 --> 08:43.102
Something about me accepting
the heavy mantel of my new position.

08:43.277 --> 08:46.396
- You set the tone, right?
- How are you set for cash?

08:46.571 --> 08:49.357
If you need the 200 bucks,
I'm strapped for cash right now.

08:49.531 --> 08:51.523
No, I'm making up a schedule
for next week.

08:51.699 --> 08:56.110
Maybe you could pull a graveyard
Attending shift, get extra cash.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.491
- Consider it done.
- Dr. Greene?

08:58.662 --> 09:01.033
Three lost sheep claiming to be
med students.

09:01.205 --> 09:02.995
I thought there were four of them.

09:03.164 --> 09:06.781
One's doing a history of a bipolar.
She'll be done by next Tuesday.

09:06.958 --> 09:08.701
- This way, guys.
- Jerry?

09:08.876 --> 09:11.710
Anything of the pediatric persuasion
up there?

09:11.878 --> 09:16.205
I've got a Scandinavian flight attendant
with a bum ankle and an earache.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.752
And you saved her all for me?

09:18.924 --> 09:21.081
I love you, big man. You know that.

09:23.010 --> 09:25.334
Nine months pregnant.
Couldn't find the bullet?

09:25.511 --> 09:27.254
Gotta be in the uterus somewhere.

09:27.429 --> 09:29.421
Pressure barely holding.
No time to waste.

09:29.597 --> 09:32.169
- Dr. Benton?
- Carter, don't bother coming in here.

09:32.349 --> 09:34.720
I'm sorry. I came straight
from the airport.

09:34.892 --> 09:37.180
- Hurricane Phyllis in the Gulf.
- Your student?

09:37.352 --> 09:39.889
- Don't remind me.
- Nice tan.

09:40.854 --> 09:44.387
Student, what is the most important
anatomical structure to identify?

09:44.564 --> 09:47.481
- The uterus?
- Ureter.

09:47.649 --> 09:50.186
You cut that and you're in big trouble.
She can't pee.

09:50.359 --> 09:52.316
- What's its name?
- Carter.

09:52.486 --> 09:56.813
Basic anatomy. What muscle forms
the floor of the pelvis?

09:57.656 --> 09:59.030
Levator ani.

09:59.198 --> 10:02.281
The ovarian artery comes off the aorta
just above the...

10:02.450 --> 10:07.240
- Comes off the aorta to...
- Inferior mesenteric artery.

10:07.411 --> 10:11.704
Doesn't the word "student" imply that
you should be teaching him something?

10:26.965 --> 10:31.506
- Hello.
- I'm Dr. Ross, and you must be...

10:31.676 --> 10:34.213
- Hulda.
- Hulda.

10:34.386 --> 10:38.429
What a beautiful name, Hulda.
What seems to be the problem?

10:38.597 --> 10:42.095
- I hurt my ankle. It hurts very much.
- Let's take a look at it.

10:42.266 --> 10:46.262
A man dropped his little vodka bottle
in the aisle and she slipped.

10:46.435 --> 10:48.676
It tickles.

10:50.229 --> 10:53.679
Haleh, lateral AP
and oblique views, please.

10:55.065 --> 10:57.555
It doesn't seem to be broken.

10:57.733 --> 11:02.310
We're gonna get some x-rays and
may consider a cast, just to be safe.

11:03.570 --> 11:07.020
Oh, and my ear is very sore.
For many months.

11:07.198 --> 11:12.949
All this going up and coming down,
I think. Yes?

11:18.204 --> 11:21.239
Look, we're really busy today
and I didn't know you were coming.

11:21.414 --> 11:27.036
Park yourselves in here, and I'll come
round you up when I get a minute.

11:27.210 --> 11:31.076
Here you go. And Harrison's Principles
of Internal Medicine.

11:31.254 --> 11:34.704
Rosen's, volumes one, two and three.
Start reading.

11:35.673 --> 11:39.716
- Hey, who's that?
- Med students. Gave them Harrison's.

11:39.884 --> 11:43.631
Wow, that'll keep them busy.
I need you in Curtain 2.

11:43.803 --> 11:47.253
There's another student
floating around with a bipolar.

11:47.430 --> 11:48.972
Could you try and find them?

11:49.140 --> 11:51.926
- So who's gonna be the new chief?
- You?

11:52.100 --> 11:55.432
- Maybe next year when I'm eligible.
- Who do you think it should be?

11:55.602 --> 12:00.938
Jane Pratt. She's smart, nice, easy
to work with. Your decision, right?

12:01.105 --> 12:05.397
I'll find out this afternoon. You guys
were roommates for a while, right?

12:06.608 --> 12:08.185
Me.

12:08.359 --> 12:10.731
How are you doing, sir?

12:10.903 --> 12:14.152
- Not so good. I got a headache.
- Probably the nitro.

12:14.321 --> 12:17.570
- Why is he down here?
- CCU is full again.

12:17.740 --> 12:20.823
Sir, you're gonna have to stay down
here for a little longer.

12:20.992 --> 12:24.940
So you can just relax
and enjoy the peace and quiet...

12:25.120 --> 12:28.452
Jerry, for God's sake, shut him up!
Will you, please?

12:31.457 --> 12:34.125
- I'll try Cardiology again.
- Thanks.

12:34.292 --> 12:37.126
- So it's Jane for chief resident?
- Why not?

12:38.461 --> 12:40.951
Carter, get ready to suction.
Here she comes.

12:43.381 --> 12:47.708
- How does she look?
- She's breathing. Color, tone: Fair.

12:48.717 --> 12:49.962
Apgar?

12:52.136 --> 12:55.835
- Eight.
- Cord's cut. Carter, come with me.

12:59.182 --> 13:01.174
No exit wound in the uterus.

13:01.350 --> 13:04.848
- Okay, Carter, see the holes?
- Oh, yes. Thighs.

13:05.019 --> 13:09.975
We've got through-and-through
gunshot wounds to both thighs.

13:10.147 --> 13:13.349
- Got it! In the placenta.
- Prep for an umbilical line.

13:15.066 --> 13:19.810
Carter, start dressing the wounds.
Rocephin and oxacillin, 250 mg each.

13:19.986 --> 13:24.148
Displace the uterus anteriorly. Check
the other organs for penetrating injury.

13:24.322 --> 13:27.405
- You're gonna be just fine, Mom.
- Hell of a way to make an entrance.

13:27.574 --> 13:32.364
- This is your lucky day.
- Oh, you're gonna be fine. Just fine.

13:43.750 --> 13:45.541
- You jet-ski?
- That's me.

13:45.710 --> 13:48.579
- Haleh, diet or regular?
- Unleaded.

13:48.753 --> 13:51.753
Hey, hey! Listen up, everybody.
We don't have a lot of time.

13:51.922 --> 13:54.756
Admin sent us another action memo.

13:54.924 --> 13:58.173
"Excessive use of surgical supplies.

13:58.343 --> 14:01.093
Personnel must exercise prudence
in the use of expendables...

14:01.261 --> 14:04.925
...i. e. 4x4s, gloves, surgical tape,
suture kits. "

14:05.097 --> 14:07.717
Why don't I just bring a needle
and thread from home?

14:07.890 --> 14:11.838
"And alcohol wipes. " Next, ACLS.

14:12.018 --> 14:16.594
Steph, you're up October 1.
And, Wendy, you've never certified.

14:16.770 --> 14:19.640
- What is it?
- Don't worry, you're gonna love it.

14:19.814 --> 14:24.640
CPR re-certification.
Lily, Lydia, Haleh.

14:24.817 --> 14:30.355
- Saturday afternoon, 1:00.
- This week? Man, I've got Sox tickets.

14:30.529 --> 14:35.983
MICN ride-alongs. Joanie, you've got
to get your hours in before Halloween.

14:36.157 --> 14:38.908
Lily, if it makes you feel any better,
I've procrastinated.

14:39.076 --> 14:43.024
Now I have to do a paramedic
ride-along or I lose my certification.

14:43.203 --> 14:45.527
Are you happy?

14:45.705 --> 14:49.866
Last, but not least, the hated peach.

14:50.040 --> 14:53.124
They have stopped making this
particularly delightful shade.

14:57.545 --> 15:00.877
Take a look at the catalog
and get back to me with your choice.

15:01.047 --> 15:02.327
I look bad in that green.

15:02.506 --> 15:05.340
Carol, 47's three minutes out,
and they're in trouble.

15:05.508 --> 15:09.421
I need your picks by the end of the day.
Most votes wins, unless I hate it.

15:09.594 --> 15:11.918
And then, whatever I like goes.

15:13.388 --> 15:15.960
- What is this all about?
- Air conditioning repairs.

15:16.140 --> 15:19.388
- Mark? Hi.
- Hi, Jane. How are you doing?

15:19.558 --> 15:23.305
Susan told me that she talked to you
about my becoming chief resident.

15:23.477 --> 15:25.386
I didn't put her up to it.

15:25.562 --> 15:28.597
I really want the job,
but I didn't ask her to approach you.

15:28.772 --> 15:32.638
- No, I didn't think you had.
- I hear Kerry Weaver's interested.

15:32.816 --> 15:36.647
- Weaver? Really? Over at Mount Sinai?
- She'd do a good job.

15:36.819 --> 15:40.151
- I'll do it better.
- All right, thanks.

15:40.988 --> 15:43.774
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:46.074 --> 15:49.407
- I thought I'd left enough time.
- You get here an hour before me.

15:49.576 --> 15:53.869
You pre-round my patients.
You order tomorrow's labs after I leave.

15:54.037 --> 15:58.579
You check out my surgical schedule
and study the cases the night before.

15:58.749 --> 16:02.412
What did you get read this summer?
Schwartz's Principles of Surgery?

16:02.584 --> 16:04.244
Sabiston's Essentials?

16:05.503 --> 16:07.827
Surgical Secrets?

16:08.880 --> 16:12.247
Let me get a turkey breast on whole
grain, lettuce, tomato, extra sprouts.

16:12.424 --> 16:17.416
No mayo.
Carter, you reflect on me now.

16:17.593 --> 16:19.419
You screw up, I screw up.

16:19.595 --> 16:22.594
If you don't know an answer,
that's because I didn't teach you.

16:22.763 --> 16:25.218
No mayo.
What do you want, Carter?

16:25.390 --> 16:29.966
Can I get a Polish dog with extra
onions, extra peppers, and cheese.

16:30.143 --> 16:31.636
A lot of cheese. Please.

16:33.436 --> 16:35.594
Surgery is the most difficult
specialty of all.

16:35.771 --> 16:40.099
Fifteen students wanted this spot
and 100 will want the surgical residency.

16:40.274 --> 16:42.562
Now, do you wanna be a surgeon?

16:42.734 --> 16:45.899
Well, then you start acting
like a surgeon.

16:46.069 --> 16:48.144
We've got a thyroidectomy
this afternoon.

16:48.320 --> 16:51.273
What do you know about the arteries
in the neck?

16:51.447 --> 16:53.356
There's a lot of them.

16:55.116 --> 16:58.116
You have an hour and 25 minutes.
I suggest you locate a Gray's...

16:58.285 --> 17:00.111
...and start memorizing it.

17:03.955 --> 17:05.614
Hi. I'm Dr. Greene.

17:05.789 --> 17:08.789
- What seems to be the problem?
- I have a rash on my thighs.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.163
- Anywhere else?
- Not this time.

17:11.334 --> 17:15.165
Why don't you hop up on the bed,
and I'll take a look.

17:15.337 --> 17:19.333
- Ms...
- Sweet. Loretta Sweet.

17:20.381 --> 17:24.164
- Are you sexually active?
- No, mostly I just lie there.

17:26.510 --> 17:30.672
- Do you use condoms?
- Lf I owned the factory I'd be rich.

17:31.805 --> 17:34.176
- Looks like contact dermatitis.
- Is that bad?

17:34.348 --> 17:37.383
No. A little cortisone cream
will clear it right up.

17:37.558 --> 17:40.131
You're allergic to something
you came in contact with.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.218
Right.

17:42.395 --> 17:47.220
I'd try and avoid coming into contact
with it again in the future.

17:47.398 --> 17:49.804
I've got two kids at home, you know.

17:55.861 --> 17:59.525
- Anything else I can do for you?
- No, thanks.

18:03.574 --> 18:05.233
Anytime.

18:12.496 --> 18:14.618
Adult male found passed out
in his own vomit.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.864
- BP 80/50 on arrival, pulse 132.
- Daddy!

18:17.041 --> 18:21.084
Resps shallow at 24. Tremulous.
Stopped breathing two minutes out.

18:21.251 --> 18:23.741
I can't ventilate him. Cyanotic.
Pulse up to 170.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.955
There's airway obstruction.
We gotta move him fast.

18:27.130 --> 18:29.003
- He's had glucose and Narcan.
- Daddy!

18:29.173 --> 18:31.627
- The kid found him. Called 911.
- Daddy!

18:31.799 --> 18:33.423
- Out of the way!
- Daddy!

18:35.510 --> 18:37.301
Nope. Damn it!

18:37.886 --> 18:40.756
Somebody get Mark.
We need a crike tray, now!

18:40.930 --> 18:44.463
Pupils are four millimeters,
equally reactive.

18:44.641 --> 18:47.842
No sign of trauma. Two IVs with saline
wide open, one liter so far.

18:48.018 --> 18:51.017
We've sucked 500 cc's of blood
from his upper airway.

18:51.186 --> 18:53.510
- Two, three...
- Again!

18:53.688 --> 18:55.679
- How much time?
- Almost three minutes.

18:55.856 --> 18:57.646
- Where's the damn doctor?
- Daddy!

18:57.815 --> 19:00.103
- Again!
- One, two, three.

19:00.275 --> 19:03.061
- We're out of time. Crike him!
- Again. Harder!

19:03.235 --> 19:04.859
Get this kid out of here!

19:05.028 --> 19:10.233
You're not gonna die on my shift, you
son of a bitch. Come on. Come on.

19:10.406 --> 19:11.816
I got it!

19:12.532 --> 19:14.608
All right, hyperventilate him.

19:16.576 --> 19:18.734
- Daddy!
- Out of the way!

19:18.911 --> 19:23.157
- All right, what have we got?
- Airway obstruction, male.

19:23.331 --> 19:25.737
Approximately 35 years old.
Tremulous.

19:25.915 --> 19:30.955
Possible impending D.T.'s, maybe septic,
maybe stroke, metabolic derangement.

19:31.711 --> 19:35.837
CBC, Chem-19, coag panel,
UA and a chest.

19:36.047 --> 19:39.461
Push D5 normal saline. He's
dehydrated. Get a banana bag going.

19:39.632 --> 19:41.588
- Carol, get a blood gas.
- Coming up.

19:41.758 --> 19:45.505
Doctor! Doctor!

19:45.677 --> 19:49.839
- Who the hell is that?
- Some drunk looking for a hot meal.

19:50.013 --> 19:52.966
- How long he been at it?
- About an hour.

19:54.183 --> 19:55.842
Damn irritating, isn't it?

19:56.017 --> 19:58.851
At least he hasn't learned
to say "nurse" yet.

20:00.103 --> 20:01.929
- Nice tan.
- Thanks.

20:02.104 --> 20:04.345
- What's that?
- Anatomy of the neck.

20:04.522 --> 20:06.893
- Forget it. Too many arteries.
- Exactly.

20:07.065 --> 20:11.144
- I thought this year would be easier.
- Wait till you start your residency.

20:11.318 --> 20:13.440
Want to show a third-year
how to start an IV?

20:13.611 --> 20:16.860
- No.
- You haven't seen her yet.

20:19.198 --> 20:22.565
I shave my legs. I used to wax them,
but that hurt so much.

20:22.741 --> 20:26.785
I love candlelight and Christmas music.
And the smells.

20:26.952 --> 20:30.450
Mulled cider and chestnuts.
I haven't had a chestnut in years.

20:30.621 --> 20:33.290
- Hi. You're the new med student?
- Yes. Thank you.

20:33.456 --> 20:35.448
- Harper Tracy.
- John Carter. How's it going?

20:35.624 --> 20:40.783
Well, I've tried to take her history,
but we didn't pass the Crimean War.

20:40.961 --> 20:45.039
You are very handsome.
Are you a doctor? My son's a doctor.

20:45.213 --> 20:48.581
- I play the cello. Do you like music?
- Yes, sometimes.

20:48.757 --> 20:53.133
This is Mrs. Constantine. I think she
has cellulitis, left lower extremity.

20:53.302 --> 20:58.377
- It's swollen, warm and tender.
- Haydn, Bach, Saint-Saëns...

20:58.555 --> 21:01.804
I'd say you're right. Sounds right.
Are you in any pain, ma'am?

21:01.973 --> 21:03.800
The pain?

21:09.770 --> 21:12.342
- She's also clearly bipolar.
- Right.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.846
Dr. Lewis wanted me to show you
how to start an IV.

21:15.023 --> 21:17.643
Pull this little gizmo out.

21:17.816 --> 21:21.978
- Find your vein. Go in bevel up.
- I play the cello...

21:22.152 --> 21:25.935
Advancing slowly until you see
a flash. Needle out, cath in.

21:26.113 --> 21:28.864
- Thanks. Got it.
- Really?

21:29.032 --> 21:32.280
Madrid, Tokyo, Milano...

21:32.450 --> 21:35.071
...Buenos Aires, Barcelona...

21:35.244 --> 21:38.030
- Ow!
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

21:38.204 --> 21:41.239
- Wow, you hit it the first time.
- The Pittsburgh Youth Symphony.

21:41.414 --> 21:44.782
Second chair. I should've been first
chair, but the conductor, bastard...

21:44.958 --> 21:48.740
...was sleeping with a fat Italian girl
who couldn't carry a tune.

21:48.919 --> 21:50.293
Sex, sex, sex!

21:50.461 --> 21:52.916
Same with my husband.
He doesn't care if I'm tired.

21:53.088 --> 21:55.625
- Thanks, John. I can take it from here.
- Day or night.

21:55.798 --> 21:58.632
- But I could dance all night...
- Okay, then.

21:58.799 --> 22:02.132
I would like to put the moon
under my heels...

22:02.302 --> 22:05.171
...and go flying up, up into the sky.

22:05.345 --> 22:07.052
Hey, Jerry.

22:07.221 --> 22:10.838
Do you know where the kid is,
from that alcoholic airway obstruction?

22:14.351 --> 22:15.974
Thanks.

22:18.770 --> 22:20.561
Sure it's not that one?

22:21.230 --> 22:23.850
- Nice shirt.
- That's all I had.

22:24.732 --> 22:27.850
- What are you doing?
- Noah's fixing the VCR.

22:28.025 --> 22:29.768
It has a tape stuck in it.

22:30.569 --> 22:32.726
You be cool now, Noah, you hear?

22:38.407 --> 22:41.572
- Your dad's gonna be okay.
- I know.

22:43.326 --> 22:47.369
He's gonna have to stay with us
for a while. Is your mom coming?

22:47.537 --> 22:49.576
She lives in Florida.

22:49.747 --> 22:52.415
Is there someone else
who could come get you?

22:52.582 --> 22:57.372
My dad will take me home in a while.
He never stays in the hospital.

22:58.419 --> 23:00.743
He's done this before?

23:03.589 --> 23:06.458
And you called 911.
That was very smart.

23:06.632 --> 23:09.585
Have you done that before too?

23:11.677 --> 23:13.254
Lots of times?

23:16.263 --> 23:18.421
Do you have a Phillips head?

23:21.558 --> 23:22.933
Sure.

23:27.103 --> 23:29.593
You really know what you're doing.

23:41.611 --> 23:44.610
- She's still down here?
- Kayson says he has no new beds.

23:44.779 --> 23:47.399
- I think we're being followed.
- Student.

23:47.572 --> 23:51.154
- Harper Tracy.
- Greene, Mark.

23:51.325 --> 23:54.692
- No, actually, my first name is Harper.
- The bipolar?

23:54.869 --> 23:59.161
Off her meds. Psych got her back on
lithium, admitted her for IV antibiotics.

23:59.330 --> 24:02.993
- How's the Jell-O, Mr. Kuzner?
- Delightful.

24:03.165 --> 24:06.118
We're gonna have you out of here
as soon as we can.

24:07.126 --> 24:11.204
Jerry? How long is it gonna be until
we get this air conditioning fixed?

24:11.379 --> 24:13.370
A week ago Thursday.

24:16.256 --> 24:20.881
Didn't they find asbestos in this
building a couple of years ago?

24:21.051 --> 24:22.710
No, not again.

24:22.885 --> 24:25.173
- Kiss little Susie for me.
- Yeah.

24:26.721 --> 24:28.298
Dr. Lewis. Pour vous.

24:28.472 --> 24:31.970
- A taste from the islands.
- Well, thank you.

24:32.141 --> 24:34.382
- Dr. Greene.
- Yeah?

24:34.559 --> 24:36.302
I have something for you.

24:38.020 --> 24:39.976
- There you go.
- Thank you.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.853
Carol.

24:42.356 --> 24:46.221
Carter, it's beautiful. Thank you.

24:50.611 --> 24:53.361
- All right.
- Carter!

24:53.529 --> 24:55.521
Where are my charts?

24:59.616 --> 25:02.616
Maybe you should've saved
one of these for yourself.

25:02.785 --> 25:04.658
Oh, but I did.

25:15.751 --> 25:17.161
Here you go.

25:19.295 --> 25:20.669
Jerry?

25:20.837 --> 25:26.624
Why are there three kids in cheap ties
reading textbooks in Exam 3?

25:26.799 --> 25:31.376
- Damn. The med students. I forgot.
- Dr. Greene, staff meeting's in five.

25:31.552 --> 25:34.920
Could you see if they need anything
and tell them I'll be back in an hour?

25:35.096 --> 25:36.637
Sure. Right.

25:36.805 --> 25:40.588
- Dr. Ross, a little taste of the islands.
- Carter, you shouldn't have.

25:40.766 --> 25:43.801
- It's Wondoa, the god of fertility.
- Just what you need, Doug.

25:43.976 --> 25:46.644
- Come on, Mark. I'll walk with you.
- To the staff meeting?

25:46.811 --> 25:50.226
Yeah, I'm nurse manager. I always go.
Nice hat.

25:52.982 --> 25:55.602
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

25:56.442 --> 25:59.525
Carter, O.R. Let's go.

25:59.694 --> 26:01.852
- You should put some ice on that.
- I'm fine.

26:02.029 --> 26:05.692
I think I got the neck arteries down.
The common carotid, superior thyroid...

26:05.864 --> 26:08.105
Thyroidectomy is called off.
We're doing a hernia.

26:08.282 --> 26:11.484
I hope you know your way around
Hesselbach's triangle.

26:18.956 --> 26:23.117
Folks, can we get started?
Please, can we start on time?

26:23.292 --> 26:26.291
Mark Greene is joining us
as an Attending...

26:26.460 --> 26:28.499
...now that he has completed
his residency.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.623
Mark, any thought as to who should
succeed you as chief resident?

26:31.838 --> 26:34.791
I was thinking Jane Pratt would be
an excellent choice.

26:34.965 --> 26:37.634
Is she that blond
who always wears sweaters?

26:37.800 --> 26:40.966
No. Brunette, tall.

26:41.136 --> 26:45.463
She's very smart. Well-liked.
Easy to get along with. Very competent.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.180
That's how I would describe you.

26:47.348 --> 26:51.593
You might want someone who'd
complement your weaknesses.

26:51.767 --> 26:57.104
- Which are...?
- Discipline, paperwork, administration.

26:57.270 --> 27:00.685
- Any other candidates?
- She'd be my first choice.

27:02.315 --> 27:03.690
Carol, any thoughts?

27:03.858 --> 27:07.806
Pratt's the best of this year's crop.
She'd take the least babysitting.

27:07.985 --> 27:10.191
Do you know Kerry Weaver
over at Mount Sinai?

27:10.362 --> 27:12.686
- Only by reputation.
- I'd like you to meet her.

27:13.155 --> 27:14.353
Okay.

27:14.531 --> 27:17.317
Can we get this Ross thing
finally resolved today?

27:17.491 --> 27:21.819
Nobody thinks this is important,
but why is my Pediatric budget...

27:21.994 --> 27:24.697
...carrying the cost
of an ER fellowship for Doug Ross?

27:24.870 --> 27:27.989
It's an ER Pediatrics fellowship, Neal.

27:28.164 --> 27:30.322
Then put him under my supervision.

27:30.499 --> 27:33.748
I'll keep him in the clinic
where I'm severely understaffed.

27:33.918 --> 27:36.917
When there's a real pediatrics
emergency, you can call him down.

27:37.086 --> 27:39.872
- They need him in the ER full-time.
- Then let them pay!

27:40.046 --> 27:42.999
They're severely under-budgeted,
and you know it.

27:43.173 --> 27:46.623
- I like him, but he's a bit of a cowboy.
- A bit?!

27:46.800 --> 27:49.670
David, he's arrogant and dismissive
of my authority.

27:49.844 --> 27:51.551
Now, I'm warning you right now.

27:51.720 --> 27:55.004
When his fellowship comes up
for renewal in November...

27:55.180 --> 27:59.223
...I'm not gonna sign off on it. You
want him, you find the money for him.

27:59.391 --> 28:01.466
Let's jump off that bridge
when we get to it.

28:03.644 --> 28:07.510
Mark, we need to talk about who gets
to cover the Attending swing shifts.

28:07.688 --> 28:10.012
It's a nice piece of change.
Any thoughts?

28:10.189 --> 28:11.731
No. I'II...

28:11.899 --> 28:13.974
I'll get you some names later.

28:14.150 --> 28:18.016
Next on the agenda, we've got
a JCAH inspection coming up.

28:18.194 --> 28:21.811
Come on, people. This is what allows
us to call ourselves a hospital.

28:21.988 --> 28:25.687
Help me!
Please, somebody help me!

28:25.866 --> 28:28.356
It's my brother! Please!
He fell off the boat!

28:28.534 --> 28:30.407
Grab the gurney on the side.

28:30.577 --> 28:33.363
- Come on, man. Please.
- No spontaneous resps.

28:34.871 --> 28:36.827
Get an ambu-bag and set up suction.

28:36.997 --> 28:40.282
- Jerry, Trauma 1 open?
- No, air conditioning guys are there.

28:40.458 --> 28:43.493
- Curtain 2.
- Get Respiratory down here, stat.

28:43.668 --> 28:45.541
Stop. Lily, we're gonna need a scribe.

28:46.378 --> 28:49.876
- Pulse ox is 80. He's hypoxic.
- ET tray, seven and a half.

28:50.047 --> 28:53.047
- Please, what's happening?
- Sir, you have to wait outside.

28:53.215 --> 28:55.884
Get these air conditioning guys
out of here now!

28:56.050 --> 28:58.042
Anybody get a blood gas?

28:59.553 --> 29:01.591
Please, please...

29:01.762 --> 29:06.054
- Tracy, come here where you can see.
- Oh, God. Don't do this, man.

29:06.223 --> 29:09.472
- Core temp's at 82.
- CBC, Chem-7, coag panel.

29:09.642 --> 29:11.301
Don't die. Please.

29:11.810 --> 29:14.726
- Are those meetings always that fun?
- Kind of boring this week.

29:14.895 --> 29:16.353
Nobody took a swing at anybody.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.596
Do they always talk about residents
like that?

29:18.773 --> 29:21.642
- Wanna hear what they said about you?
- That drunk with the kid...

29:21.816 --> 29:23.689
...he's trying to check himself out AMA.

29:23.859 --> 29:27.807
It's none of my business, but Jane
Pratt? I think Morgenstern has a point.

29:27.986 --> 29:32.445
I didn't get a chance to thank you
for the Attending shifts.

29:32.614 --> 29:35.069
I'm kind of behind on my car payments,
you know?

29:35.241 --> 29:38.490
- You've worked with Kerry Weaver?
- Yeah, we've crossed paths.

29:38.660 --> 29:41.410
Morgenstern wants me
to consider her for chief.

29:41.578 --> 29:44.531
- Really?
- That bad?

29:44.705 --> 29:46.946
Did you ever see Cuckoo's Nest?

29:50.792 --> 29:54.409
- I hear you're going someplace.
- Yeah. Where's my kid?

29:54.586 --> 29:58.452
- Noah's in the lounge watching cartoons.
- Well, get him. We're going home.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.416
You're suffering from severe
electrolyte imbalance.

30:01.590 --> 30:04.625
Your white blood count is high,
and you probably have pneumonia.

30:04.800 --> 30:06.424
I just need to sleep it off.

30:06.593 --> 30:09.593
You need to be admitted for fluids
and IV antibiotics.

30:09.762 --> 30:11.884
So you can charge me 5000
bucks like last time?

30:12.055 --> 30:13.963
Let's talk about last time.

30:14.139 --> 30:18.764
You were drowning in your own vomit.
Your son called it in. Just like today.

30:18.934 --> 30:21.506
- Where's my damn shirt?
- We had to cut it off you.

30:21.686 --> 30:24.851
I paid 30 bucks for that shirt!
Who's gonna pay me? You?!

30:26.772 --> 30:29.807
Somebody... I swear to God,
somebody's gonna pay for that...

30:29.982 --> 30:33.397
...if I don't find that shirt.
Where the hell...?

30:59.292 --> 31:00.666
You're not going anyplace.

31:04.920 --> 31:08.252
I don't know why, but for some reason
that boy cares about you.

31:08.422 --> 31:13.378
Stay and get straightened out.
Give Noah something to be proud of.

31:18.136 --> 31:20.970
- He's not warming up fast enough.
- He's in V-fib.

31:21.138 --> 31:23.545
Damn it, let's shock him. Two hundred.

31:25.724 --> 31:28.131
Clear. Harper, clear.

31:29.143 --> 31:32.262
- Nothing.
- Three hundred. Clear.

31:32.437 --> 31:36.646
- Someone get them out of there.
- Hey! Get down out of there!

31:36.814 --> 31:39.684
- What?
- Come down now!

31:40.567 --> 31:43.436
Three-sixty. Clear.

31:52.782 --> 31:55.533
Hey, we've got a beat.

31:56.660 --> 31:59.150
Hey, Davey, are you okay?

32:04.206 --> 32:06.328
What are the borders
of Hesselbach's triangle?

32:06.499 --> 32:08.656
- Some kind of vessel.
- Deep inferior epigastric.

32:08.834 --> 32:11.240
- And a ligament. Poupon.
- That's a mustard, Carter.

32:11.419 --> 32:13.873
Poupart's ligament
and the rectus sheath.

32:14.045 --> 32:16.286
You didn't get one of Dr. Hicks'
questions right.

32:16.463 --> 32:18.502
You told me we were doing
a thyroidectomy...

32:18.673 --> 32:22.337
Embarrass me in front of another surgeon
and you'll spend the rest of your Sub-I...

32:22.509 --> 32:25.508
...suturing bagel cuts and baby falls.
- Rescue 47's on its way.

32:25.677 --> 32:28.167
The gang shooting?
Somebody shot the shooter.

32:39.310 --> 32:43.686
Dr. Greene? Heard a lot of great things
about you.

32:43.855 --> 32:45.562
I'm Kerry Weaver.

32:45.731 --> 32:50.640
- Oh, hi. I'm Mark. Sit down.
- Thank you.

32:52.819 --> 32:55.522
Just eating something.

32:55.695 --> 33:00.154
So Morgenstern says you're gonna
need a lot of help around here.

33:00.323 --> 33:01.982
Really?

33:03.575 --> 33:07.523
- Gonna finish those fries?
- No.

33:09.287 --> 33:12.405
So when do I start?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.992
- Are we all set for this guy's airway?
- Yep.

33:20.168 --> 33:22.326
- What happened?
- Guy fell through the ceiling.

33:22.503 --> 33:24.246
- Landed on a patient.
- You're kidding.

33:24.421 --> 33:26.329
Broke the patient's ribs and his own leg.

33:26.506 --> 33:29.624
15-year-old male.
Shotgun to the chest at close range.

33:29.799 --> 33:32.254
- No vitals. No pulses. Nothing.
- Welcome back, guys.

33:32.426 --> 33:35.710
- This the shooter of the pregnant lady?
- So they say.

33:35.886 --> 33:39.585
- His chest is a mess, you guys.
- Carter, CPR. Six units O-neg.

33:42.807 --> 33:44.514
- Tube's leaking.
- Asystole.

33:44.683 --> 33:47.054
Man, I think I just punched
right through his ribs.

33:47.226 --> 33:50.428
Skip it. Let's tube him! Amp of epi.

33:53.897 --> 33:56.767
- Seven and a half.
- Kind of rusty at this.

33:56.941 --> 33:59.609
- Find the cords and thread it through.
- Do it now, Carter.

34:00.860 --> 34:03.147
- Let's crack him.
- I got it.

34:06.154 --> 34:07.897
Spreader!

34:12.949 --> 34:16.697
Carter, retract that lung. Here we go.

34:16.869 --> 34:19.952
- Whoa, man...
- Just take a deep breath, all right?

34:21.539 --> 34:23.909
I need you to stay on your feet here.

34:24.081 --> 34:26.702
He's totally dry. Trendelenberg!

34:27.876 --> 34:31.409
- Think I'm gonna be sick.
- No, you're not. Come on, internal CPR.

34:32.170 --> 34:36.498
- Fibrillating!
- Damn! His right ventricle is hit.

34:38.674 --> 34:40.962
Twenty-five. Clear!

34:43.510 --> 34:45.797
We got a beat! Nope, it's gone.

34:45.969 --> 34:47.428
Fifty! Clear!

34:49.389 --> 34:51.545
- Asystole!
- Well, that helped a lot.

34:51.724 --> 34:54.639
Man, smells kind of like a barbecue
in here, huh?

34:54.809 --> 34:56.266
Oh, God...

35:00.729 --> 35:02.436
Welcome back, Carter.

35:07.984 --> 35:11.517
- Oh, no. Please...
- He's gonna be okay.

35:13.487 --> 35:16.819
Thank you. Thank you.

35:16.989 --> 35:21.982
He does have
a couple of broken ribs.

35:30.747 --> 35:32.620
All right, that's it.

35:33.582 --> 35:35.076
Good try, people.

35:35.250 --> 35:37.123
He was dead
before he came in the door.

35:37.293 --> 35:39.664
- Who's got the death bundle?
- I'll get it.

35:39.836 --> 35:41.246
You all right?

35:42.254 --> 35:46.085
Good. Sew him back up. Nothing fancy.
I'll see you at 6 a. m. Sharp.

35:46.257 --> 35:49.256
And, Carter. Prostatectomy
in the morning.

35:49.425 --> 35:52.460
Adrenalectomy for a
pheochromocytoma in the afternoon.

35:59.014 --> 36:01.469
- Hey, guys. Here's your equipment.
- Excuse me.

36:01.641 --> 36:03.384
- The kid make it?
- No.

36:03.559 --> 36:05.930
- It's Hathaway, right?
- Yeah.

36:06.102 --> 36:08.094
This is Shep. Raul.

36:08.270 --> 36:11.768
- Well, see you around, Hathaway.
- Oh, hey, guys.

36:12.147 --> 36:15.349
I have to do a ride-along
for my MICN re-certification.

36:15.524 --> 36:17.682
Mind if I tag along with you next week?

36:17.859 --> 36:20.527
Sure. You bet. Anytime, Hathaway.

36:27.240 --> 36:28.947
- What?
- Nothing.

36:29.116 --> 36:32.982
- It's not like that.
- I didn't say a thing.

36:34.411 --> 36:36.403
Nurse Hathaway,
what are you doing tonight?

36:36.579 --> 36:39.033
I thought maybe I'd rent a movie.
Make some popcorn.

36:39.205 --> 36:41.874
- Maybe I'll bring a pizza.
- I don't remember inviting you.

36:42.040 --> 36:45.739
- You didn't. I invited myself.
- Good night.

36:46.543 --> 36:50.160
- My rule-out MI is still not in CCU.
- I can't miss the train.

36:50.337 --> 36:53.870
What's the point of having a CCU
if you can never get anyone into it?

36:54.048 --> 36:56.419
If I don't make it to Union Station
in 25 minutes...

36:56.591 --> 36:58.832
...I'm gonna be walking to Milwaukee.

36:59.009 --> 37:03.550
- Mark, you need to do something.
- I will. I promise, first thing Monday.

37:03.720 --> 37:06.008
Hey, I heard you hired Kerry Weaver
as chief.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.385
That's definitely a move
in the right direction.

37:08.556 --> 37:10.548
- You didn't hire Jane?
- No, I didn't.

37:10.724 --> 37:13.214
Were you planning on letting me
read it off the board?

37:13.393 --> 37:15.799
It was my decision. I made it.

37:17.645 --> 37:19.851
I gotta pick Susie up from daycare.

37:21.231 --> 37:22.689
Hey, Dr. Greene...

37:22.857 --> 37:24.599
Those medical students
are still in Exam 3.

37:24.774 --> 37:26.932
Want me to send them home?

37:33.863 --> 37:36.188
Excuse me. Excuse me.

37:36.365 --> 37:39.982
Yes, yes, you're the young lady
who helped me earlier today, aren't you?

37:40.159 --> 37:42.530
Mrs. Constantine,
are you feeling better?

37:42.702 --> 37:44.326
Well, I'm a bit tired.

37:44.495 --> 37:47.945
Did I tell you that I play the cello?

37:48.122 --> 37:51.655
- Once or twice.
- Sorry.

37:51.832 --> 37:55.532
Well, I would like to play something
for you as a kind of thank-you.

37:56.335 --> 37:57.959
I don't think that's necessary.

37:58.128 --> 38:00.618
My son brought my cello to me.

38:00.796 --> 38:03.417
It helps me pass the time
until I get better.

38:03.590 --> 38:06.542
Really. You don't have to do this.

38:06.716 --> 38:09.633
I mean, maybe you shouldn't do this.

39:24.305 --> 39:26.427
Hey, are you okay?

39:27.682 --> 39:29.425
Yeah.

39:30.475 --> 39:31.969
No, I'm fine.

39:33.602 --> 39:36.685
- Tough first day back, huh?
- Yeah.

39:37.771 --> 39:42.977
Some days, like today, I have to forget
or I'd never come back.

39:46.860 --> 39:52.149
- So did you have a good summer?
- Yeah, it was great.

39:52.822 --> 39:54.280
Really.

39:54.448 --> 39:57.318
I did a pedes rotation
over at Children's...

39:57.492 --> 40:00.064
...and spent about five weeks kicking
around St. Bart's.

40:00.243 --> 40:03.777
Really? I always wanted to go.
Was it nice?

40:03.954 --> 40:05.448
Yeah.

40:08.165 --> 40:10.737
Hey, Doc! Doc!
Can you give us a hand?

40:10.916 --> 40:13.122
Kid on a bike got hit by a car.
Full arrest.

40:14.961 --> 40:18.624
- I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
- Yeah, see you tomorrow.

40:20.339 --> 40:22.165
Okay, give me the bullet!

40:37.933 --> 40:39.177
Sorry.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.478
Hold on!

40:57.486 --> 40:59.811
No, hold it. Thanks.

41:17.874 --> 41:22.249
Chloe? Is dinner almost ready?
I am starving.

41:22.418 --> 41:25.418
Yeah, all we gotta do is drop in
the pasta and we're all set.

41:25.587 --> 41:28.919
Hello, my beautiful girl.

41:30.048 --> 41:34.672
Hi. Hi, prettiest girl.

41:34.842 --> 41:37.877
- How was school today?
- Great.

41:38.052 --> 41:42.428
They're teaching us how to use Word
and the spreadsheets.

41:42.597 --> 41:45.051
Honey, you wanna come up
and say hi to Mommy?

41:45.223 --> 41:47.927
Okay, here we go.
Let me get your head there.

41:49.059 --> 41:50.304
There we go.

41:50.477 --> 41:52.219
Oh, no.

41:54.521 --> 41:58.683
Whoops. There we go,
there we go. That's good.

42:01.900 --> 42:04.473
Yes, you're okay.

42:04.652 --> 42:08.944
Yes. Oh, no, no. It's okay.

42:10.114 --> 42:12.485
Okay.

42:12.657 --> 42:14.447
It's okay.

42:14.616 --> 42:18.114
I missed you. Yeah.

42:35.504 --> 42:36.748
Oh, God...

42:37.880 --> 42:39.540
What time is it?

42:41.466 --> 42:43.256
Oh, God.

42:51.180 --> 42:52.757
Oh, man.

42:54.891 --> 42:56.681
Peter?

42:57.517 --> 42:59.509
- Peter, hey, wake up.
- What?

43:00.310 --> 43:01.934
We fell asleep.

43:02.103 --> 43:04.391
It's almost midnight.

43:04.563 --> 43:06.222
Oh, man...

43:07.481 --> 43:09.390
What time does he get off work?

43:09.566 --> 43:11.890
In 10 minutes.

43:16.904 --> 43:18.528
Hey...

43:19.530 --> 43:21.273
Why don't you stay?

43:23.199 --> 43:25.072
You know I can't.

43:29.745 --> 43:31.571
I love you.

43:38.125 --> 43:39.784
I'll see you tomorrow.
