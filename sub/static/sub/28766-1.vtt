00:22.005 --> 00:23.005
Hello.

00:32.255 --> 00:34.713
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:34.796 --> 00:36.755
THE LAME PLAN

00:36.838 --> 00:38.505
THE CRAZY PLAN

00:38.588 --> 00:41.130
THE BOOTY PLAN

00:41.213 --> 00:43.088
THE HOOK-UP PLAN

00:48.713 --> 00:49.713
Elsa? Elsa?

00:54.005 --> 00:55.005
Elsa... Morning, darling.

00:59.546 --> 01:00.963
It's 9:30, sweetheart.

01:01.546 --> 01:02.380
Huh?

01:03.213 --> 01:04.338
9:30.

01:04.921 --> 01:05.921
9:30?

01:06.338 --> 01:08.046
Oh, shit!

01:08.463 --> 01:09.463
Dad!

01:10.213 --> 01:11.588
I'm so late for work.

01:11.671 --> 01:15.255
But why didn't my phone ring?

01:15.338 --> 01:18.171
-Oh, yeah...
-You left the front door open.

01:18.671 --> 01:20.713
-Good night, I'm guessing?
-No, horrible.

01:21.255 --> 01:22.963
What time's your first patient?

01:23.046 --> 01:25.171
-Five minutes ago.
-What?

01:25.255 --> 01:26.588
PSYCHOLOGIES: CREATIVITY

01:26.671 --> 01:28.880
Sorry, it's my daughter.
She's living at home.

01:28.963 --> 01:29.796
Hello.

01:31.588 --> 01:33.005
No, no, no...

01:35.296 --> 01:36.546
-Elsa!
-Yes?

01:37.630 --> 01:38.713
Here, take this.

01:42.255 --> 01:44.755
Oh, shit! What a pain!

01:45.546 --> 01:47.421
I'm sick of living out of boxes!

01:57.213 --> 01:58.255
Excuse me, sorry!

02:00.838 --> 02:02.130
Oh, no, no, no!

02:05.630 --> 02:06.630
Hey, Victor! Hello.

02:29.171 --> 02:30.713
-Hi, Chantal.
-Six years?

02:31.963 --> 02:33.296
Yes, I understand. Yes.

02:34.380 --> 02:36.505
Social housing requires
a lot of paperwork,

02:36.588 --> 02:38.421
but you do have the option...

02:39.338 --> 02:40.171
Hello?

02:43.755 --> 02:44.755
Hey, you. Hey.

02:47.255 --> 02:48.588
You look like hell.

02:49.130 --> 02:50.796
-Tell me everything.
-I can't.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.796
-Total blackout.
-Oh, right!

02:54.171 --> 02:55.963
A really big night, then.

02:57.338 --> 02:58.713
I need to call my phone.

03:03.213 --> 03:05.255
Oh, time for the PR asshole?

03:13.755 --> 03:16.213
-So? Feeling better?
-What?

03:21.713 --> 03:25.088
23:05. "Hey, Max, where are you?
Did you leave the party?"

03:25.838 --> 03:29.796
-I texted you?
-23:10. "You left with Gaia the whore."

03:30.421 --> 03:31.713
23:12.

03:31.796 --> 03:34.255
"Sorry, not the whore,
she's probably nice."

03:34.838 --> 03:37.213
23:13. "Except that she's a slut...

03:37.755 --> 03:39.588
who stole my man. Bye."

03:40.505 --> 03:42.171
Are you sure that's from me?

03:42.255 --> 03:43.463
23:18.

03:45.463 --> 03:47.171
"Blow yourself tomorrow."

03:55.921 --> 03:57.213
Oh, no, no, no!

03:57.296 --> 03:59.296
No, no, no, stupid autocorrect.

03:59.380 --> 04:00.671
I WILL BLOW YOU TOMORROW.

04:00.755 --> 04:03.005
<i>-Confiscado!</i>
-Hey, I was texting!

04:03.088 --> 04:06.296
-Were you sexting Max?
-Yes, but it was a work thing.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.713
You have to stop this.

04:08.296 --> 04:12.005
-But why isn't he here?
-To avoid this.

04:12.088 --> 04:14.380
-He left before you arrived.
-What?

04:14.463 --> 04:17.130
-Come on, let's dance!
-He was here?

04:17.213 --> 04:19.796
Let's dance. And stop drinking!

04:24.421 --> 04:25.921
1 o'clock. Checking you out.

04:29.963 --> 04:30.963
No, no, no...

04:31.546 --> 04:33.463
-He's checking <i>you</i> out.
-Rubbish!

04:33.546 --> 04:36.421
I'm pregnant to my ears
so apart from perverts and gynos...

04:38.255 --> 04:39.755
He's coming over. Smile.

04:40.630 --> 04:41.630
No, don't smile.

04:43.421 --> 04:44.255
Hey.

04:44.963 --> 04:45.796
Hey.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.630
-How's it going?
-Good.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.296
Pervert!

04:49.380 --> 04:50.671
-Stop it!
-Pervy gyno!

04:50.755 --> 04:52.880
-Pervert!
-Not at all!

04:52.963 --> 04:55.338
-Pervert! Go away!
-Stop it! No!

04:55.421 --> 04:57.046
Go away! Go away!

04:58.505 --> 04:59.755
For once...

05:00.296 --> 05:02.296
-What did he want?
-Huh? Nothing.

05:05.338 --> 05:07.963
Oh, Matthieu! King of <i>choux!</i>

05:08.046 --> 05:09.171
-How's it going?
-Good!

05:09.255 --> 05:10.880
-Having fun, princesses?
-Yes!

05:10.963 --> 05:13.213
Long live French <i>choux</i> in Paris!

05:13.296 --> 05:14.380
Long live France!

05:14.755 --> 05:15.838
Long live us!

05:17.046 --> 05:18.088
Shall we dance?

05:18.380 --> 05:19.963
She's enjoying the open bar.

05:24.380 --> 05:26.213
She can't get over Max.

05:26.296 --> 05:29.755
When she finds out he's getting married
and you're the groomsmen...

05:31.463 --> 05:33.588
Right, Milou, shall we?

05:33.671 --> 05:36.921
-I'm back at the hospital in five hours.
-I'll order you a taxi.

05:37.005 --> 05:38.588
You work such shitty shifts.

05:40.296 --> 05:42.171
I can't. I can't leave now.

05:43.046 --> 05:44.463
I'm babysitting.

05:44.546 --> 05:46.421
-OK, don't come home too late.
-OK.

05:47.505 --> 05:49.630
Shots!

05:49.713 --> 05:52.421
Was there anything else?
I need to call Charlotte.

05:52.505 --> 05:54.713
I mean, the cell she stole off me.

05:54.796 --> 05:56.796
I mean, not stole, whatever.

05:57.421 --> 05:58.421
Elsa...

05:59.630 --> 06:00.880
you're a great girl.

06:01.546 --> 06:03.505
I mean, you're smart,

06:04.171 --> 06:05.213
you're beautiful.

06:06.796 --> 06:07.921
But you're such a pain.

06:08.505 --> 06:11.088
Seriously, you have to stop.
I've been understanding.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.880
-Gaia has been too.
-No... No!

06:12.963 --> 06:13.963
Elsa!

06:14.046 --> 06:17.630
Elsa, we loved each other enough
not to ruin everything, didn't we?

06:20.838 --> 06:21.838
Have a good day.

06:27.463 --> 06:29.005
"Blow yourself tomorrow"?

06:29.671 --> 06:31.838
He loves himself so much
he's probably tried.

06:32.796 --> 06:34.213
I never want to drink again.

06:34.296 --> 06:36.463
Fuck, I'm out of control!

06:46.255 --> 06:48.338
-Do you want some fresh air?
-I'm fine.

06:49.838 --> 06:50.880
I'm sorry, girls.

06:51.921 --> 06:55.213
-I totally ruined the evening.
-Are you joking, sweetie?

06:55.296 --> 06:57.505
-We just want you to be happy.
-Yeah...

06:59.421 --> 07:00.963
When did you last have sex?

07:01.546 --> 07:04.088
-Not sure it's the right time...
-25 months ago.

07:04.796 --> 07:07.088
Who knows, it might have closed up. Gross!

07:07.171 --> 07:09.630
-What?!
-Yeah, like when you pierce your ears.

07:09.713 --> 07:11.630
When you lose the earring, it closes up.

07:12.338 --> 07:15.755
You're stuck on Maxime's dick print.
You need to free yourself!

07:15.838 --> 07:17.963
You're stuck on his frequency,
it's science!

07:18.046 --> 07:20.296
OK, great analysis. Thanks, Dr Vagina.

07:20.380 --> 07:23.171
We're in 2018.
She doesn't need a man to get a grip.

07:23.255 --> 07:26.088
Not a man!
Just a regular penis in her vagina.

07:26.171 --> 07:27.880
-Nonsense!
-It's true!

07:27.963 --> 07:30.880
-There's so much more to being happy.
-Oh, yeah?

07:30.963 --> 07:35.213
-Traveling, friends, work...
-Sex.

07:35.880 --> 07:36.880
No, but...

07:37.255 --> 07:40.130
I don't want a guy for the sake of it.

07:40.713 --> 07:41.796
I want something real.

07:42.755 --> 07:44.630
Something extraordinary...

07:46.421 --> 07:47.963
like I had with Maxime.

07:48.046 --> 07:49.421
-No.
-Yes!

07:49.505 --> 07:51.880
-No. No.
-But yes!

07:52.713 --> 07:53.755
Oh, I love you.

07:54.963 --> 07:55.963
We love you too.

08:01.921 --> 08:03.796
I have to get up in three hours...

08:05.255 --> 08:06.255
Good night!

08:10.838 --> 08:13.880
Poor thing. She's so insecure
she doesn't believe in anything.

08:13.963 --> 08:15.505
There must be a way we can help.

08:16.213 --> 08:17.630
I'd even pay for it!

08:23.630 --> 08:25.380
Come on, Charlotte, pick up. Yeah, Charlotte, pick up.

08:38.921 --> 08:41.880
Well, well, Moules-Frites. You dig kebabs!

08:41.963 --> 08:44.338
Yes, you do, just like your mommy.

08:45.671 --> 08:47.546
You do. Come on, home time.

08:52.421 --> 08:55.630
Come on! Hey, wake up.
No work today, Mr. Choux?

08:55.713 --> 08:57.630
-Huh? What?
-No work?

08:57.713 --> 08:58.880
-Yes...
-So?

08:58.963 --> 09:00.213
What time is it?

09:02.880 --> 09:04.880
What's vibrating like that?

09:05.546 --> 09:07.088
Elsa. She won't stop calling.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.713
Why don't you pick up?

09:08.796 --> 09:11.171
Having sex twice
doesn't mean I'll listen to you.

09:11.421 --> 09:13.213
Oh, yeah? What about three times? There'll be no third time.

09:17.130 --> 09:20.130
You live in London
and you're best mates with my brother.

09:20.213 --> 09:21.046
Hey!

09:21.338 --> 09:24.880
Shit. Speak of the devil.
Getting out of here won't be easy.

09:24.963 --> 09:27.130
Wait till he's asleep or go via the roof.

09:28.421 --> 09:30.088
-Via the roof?
-Yeah!

09:30.171 --> 09:31.796
How did you get in yesterday?

09:32.213 --> 09:33.213
Come on.

09:33.755 --> 09:34.921
Back to stealth mode.

09:36.046 --> 09:37.963
-How did it go last night?
-Great!

09:38.630 --> 09:40.671
I'm off to prenatal yoga to get a spot.

09:41.505 --> 09:42.963
Mat leave is pretty sweet.

09:43.963 --> 09:47.255
-It'll be good for you two.
-Yes. And for you two, no?

09:49.171 --> 09:50.630
I printed you a new list. Sleep well. Love you!

09:56.546 --> 09:57.546
Love you!

10:00.588 --> 10:02.671
Tidy kitchen, dust...

10:05.213 --> 10:07.380
disinfect the toilet brush?!

10:10.505 --> 10:12.505
She's nesting, it's great.

10:12.588 --> 10:14.963
She's great, it's all good,
we're having a baby. In two months,
everything will be back to normal.

10:19.463 --> 10:21.088
Come on, buddy, be strong!

10:41.796 --> 10:43.046
Hey, guys, I'm here!

10:43.671 --> 10:44.671
Hey, boss!

10:54.380 --> 10:56.005
It's OK, come down.

10:57.130 --> 10:58.421
Come on, quickly!

10:58.505 --> 10:59.505
Hurry up! <i>Hello?</i>

11:17.088 --> 11:18.130
Hello?

11:18.213 --> 11:19.213
Uh...

11:20.005 --> 11:21.963
Could I speak to Charlotte, please?

11:22.630 --> 11:23.671
<i>-Charlotte?</i>
-Yes.

11:23.755 --> 11:25.963
The girl you spent the night with,
apparently.

11:26.046 --> 11:28.505
<i>I don't know who you're talking about.</i>
<i>I was alone.</i>

11:28.796 --> 11:31.546
If you didn't go home with her,
why do you have my phone?

11:31.630 --> 11:33.880
-Did you steal it? Asshole!
<i>-Whoa!</i>

11:33.963 --> 11:35.380
<i>I didn't steal it, I found it.</i>

11:36.588 --> 11:39.296
Yeah, right, you found it.
In Charlotte's bag.

11:39.671 --> 11:42.296
<i>No, on the bar at the party.</i>

11:43.005 --> 11:44.380
Oh, shit. What a jerk.

11:45.921 --> 11:47.046
Right, uh...

11:47.338 --> 11:48.338
I'm sorry.

11:49.380 --> 11:50.963
Where are you? Can I pick it up?

11:51.338 --> 11:52.671
<i>I could drop it off.</i>

11:52.755 --> 11:54.255
<i>I'd be happy to see you again.</i>

11:54.338 --> 11:56.755
-We've seen each other before?
<i>-I saw you.</i>

11:56.838 --> 11:58.880
<i>I ran after you and...</i>

11:58.963 --> 12:00.921
<i>you left in an Uber with your friends.</i> And how do you know which one I am?

12:03.380 --> 12:07.213
<i>The others were taking pictures of you</i>
<i>while you were sick out of the window.</i>

12:07.296 --> 12:10.296
Oh, no, no. I wasn't sick,
I was getting some fresh air.

12:10.380 --> 12:13.796
<i>You looked beautiful.</i>
<i>Where do you work? I could drop it off.</i>

12:14.338 --> 12:15.338
-Yes!
<i>-City Hall.</i>

12:16.255 --> 12:19.546
<i>-City Hall. 6 p.m.?</i>
-6 p.m. OK.

12:20.588 --> 12:21.505
Carousel.

12:21.588 --> 12:23.380
-By the carousel?
<i>-Perfect.</i>

12:24.088 --> 12:25.380
<i>-See you.</i>
-See you later.

12:29.046 --> 12:30.046
Oh, shit!

12:30.505 --> 12:31.921
Hey, maybe he's the one!

12:33.005 --> 12:34.921
Rubbish!

12:35.005 --> 12:37.421
Guys who flirt on the phone
like that are toads.

12:38.546 --> 12:40.671
Otherwise, they wouldn't need a phone.

12:40.755 --> 12:41.755
I know my shit. Hey.

13:05.255 --> 13:06.255
Hey.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.255
Here you go. In one piece.

13:10.630 --> 13:11.630
Thanks.

13:16.088 --> 13:19.546
-And sorry about earlier, on the phone.
-Don't worry about it.

13:20.588 --> 13:21.588
I'm Jules. Jules Dupont.

13:24.380 --> 13:25.630
Is that a pseudonym?

13:26.046 --> 13:26.880
Sorry.

13:26.963 --> 13:27.796
Elsa.

13:27.880 --> 13:28.880
Elsa Elsa. Elsa Elsa?

13:30.963 --> 13:31.963
OK.

13:33.255 --> 13:36.463
-So, you work at City Hall?
-Yeah, hence the...

13:36.963 --> 13:38.296
-Cool.
-Yeah, cool.

13:40.588 --> 13:42.088
Well, thanks, I...

13:43.463 --> 13:45.713
-I'll be off.
-Don't you have time to...

13:48.421 --> 13:50.046
have a go on the carousel?

13:50.546 --> 13:51.963
You want me to be sick again?

13:55.130 --> 13:57.255
Pleasure to meet you, Jules Dupont.

13:59.338 --> 14:00.338
Later, alligator. I hope so.

14:08.255 --> 14:09.296
" Later, alligator?"

14:09.380 --> 14:11.463
-Yeah.
-Who says that? -Well, no one.
-Think you're a comedian?

14:14.005 --> 14:14.838
No...

14:14.921 --> 14:16.963
-You don't even have an answer.
-No...

14:17.046 --> 14:18.046
How's it going?

14:18.880 --> 14:20.838
Sorry, girls, I got pulled over.

14:20.921 --> 14:23.505
-Nearly lost my license.
-How did you get away with it?

14:23.588 --> 14:25.463
-I don't want to know.
-Chill out!

14:25.546 --> 14:28.046
Just because <i>I</i> have sex
doesn't mean I'm a whore.

14:29.046 --> 14:31.338
Did you thank Matthieu
for the job at the party?

14:31.963 --> 14:34.921
Yeah, yeah. You know,
sometimes, between friends...

14:35.880 --> 14:37.963
-What's that look for?
-Elsa...

14:38.046 --> 14:41.546
A beautiful man returned her phone,
offered her a carousel ride.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.630
This idiot refused.

14:43.380 --> 14:44.755
Lost her tongue, too?

14:44.838 --> 14:46.880
Can we Google him? Facebook?

14:46.963 --> 14:47.963
-No...
-Twitter!

14:48.046 --> 14:50.255
No, his name is Jules Dupont.

14:50.338 --> 14:52.088
-There are thousands of them!
-Shit.

14:52.171 --> 14:53.963
We'll find him, I know it.

14:54.671 --> 14:56.546
-He was at the party, right?
-So?

14:57.046 --> 14:59.088
He didn't come alone. Check your photos.

14:59.588 --> 15:01.213
Maybe he was with someone we know.

15:01.755 --> 15:03.338
-Yeah...
-Come on!

15:05.963 --> 15:07.880
We'll never find him.

15:08.380 --> 15:10.046
-It's him!
-What?

15:10.505 --> 15:11.505
What?

15:13.713 --> 15:17.171
"Dinner Friday night.
Roger la Grenouille, 8 p.m.?"

15:18.088 --> 15:19.880
And his phone number!

15:19.963 --> 15:21.713
It's like <i>Amélie.</i> Lucky you!

15:22.255 --> 15:23.588
Yeah, but no. No.

15:23.671 --> 15:25.338
-No, no, no.
-What do you mean?

15:25.421 --> 15:26.421
I won't go because...

15:26.505 --> 15:27.838
-I'm sorry?
-What's that?

15:27.921 --> 15:29.338
...because the guy looks...

15:29.796 --> 15:31.505
like a GQ model.

15:31.588 --> 15:33.796
Like he does sunbeds,
gets his teeth whitened.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.755
The whole thing is really awkward.

15:35.838 --> 15:37.338
-I quite like it.
-No...

15:37.421 --> 15:39.880
-I bet he wears tighty-whities.
-Let me explain.

15:39.963 --> 15:41.463
-You're going.
-Oh, yes.

15:41.796 --> 15:43.671
You're going, and I'm warning you.

15:43.755 --> 15:48.005
If you mention your ex's name once,
I will kill you. Got it?

15:53.796 --> 15:57.046
You see,
Maxime was a narcissistic pervert.

15:57.838 --> 16:00.213
You know about narcissistic perverts?

16:00.296 --> 16:02.630
They have nothing to do
with sexual perverts.

16:02.713 --> 16:05.421
Even though the sex was really...

16:06.255 --> 16:07.838
it was really unique.

16:07.921 --> 16:10.630
But Maxime wasn't a pervert all the time.

16:10.713 --> 16:12.380
No, he wasn't.

16:12.463 --> 16:13.755
The problem is that, today,

16:14.171 --> 16:16.421
the term is overused, you see?

16:16.880 --> 16:18.255
Yeah, totally.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.546
-Look at me.
-Yes?

16:24.630 --> 16:26.505
There we go. I wanted to see your eyes.

16:26.588 --> 16:29.588
-I can't see anything without glasses.
-Oh, yeah?

16:31.588 --> 16:32.588
Shall we order?

16:34.213 --> 16:36.338
-Yeah...
-I'm starving!

16:36.421 --> 16:37.421
The bill, buddy?

16:38.171 --> 16:39.505
No, we're going to...

16:40.046 --> 16:41.338
we'll have a snack.

16:41.421 --> 16:45.505
The house specials are
the andouillette and foie-gras platters.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.130
Shit... Are you vegan?

16:47.213 --> 16:49.796
Oh, no. Not at all!

16:49.880 --> 16:51.671
No, my friends call me Miss Piggy.

16:54.130 --> 16:56.921
I mean not in a sexual way,
just like the animal.

16:57.338 --> 16:59.421
Yeah. Nothing to do with...

17:02.713 --> 17:05.046
-Mixed platter?
-Mixed platter.

17:05.130 --> 17:07.671
One mixed platter coming up
for the lovebirds!

17:13.338 --> 17:15.046
And what about you?

17:15.963 --> 17:17.255
Tell me about yourself.

17:18.671 --> 17:19.505
OK.

17:19.963 --> 17:22.755
You're the boss.
What do you want to know?

17:24.338 --> 17:26.338
Well, what do you do?

17:28.505 --> 17:29.505
I'm a teacher. Oh, yeah?

17:31.588 --> 17:35.380
-You look nothing like a teacher.
-Oh, it's just preschool.

17:36.130 --> 17:38.796
Older than seven and I'm lost,
intellectually.

17:44.130 --> 17:45.171
That was a joke.

17:45.255 --> 17:47.046
-Shit, I thought...
-You thought?

17:48.296 --> 17:50.713
I actually thought you were really thick.

17:53.755 --> 17:55.463
No, it's great.

17:55.880 --> 17:56.880
It's great.

17:57.338 --> 17:58.588
She's stopped replying.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.755
Do you think he killed her? It happens.

18:02.671 --> 18:05.796
-Trust her! Stop hassling her.
-It's stressing me out.

18:05.880 --> 18:08.880
-I don't want her to be set back.
-No chance.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.671
-How's it going?
-Hey.

18:11.880 --> 18:14.046
-Talking about me?
-Of course, what else?

18:15.088 --> 18:17.296
When Elsa isn't here,
we change the subject.

18:19.213 --> 18:20.921
What can I tell you about myself?

18:21.005 --> 18:26.421
I love my job, I have a great flat
and I have amazing friends.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.546
I'm currently single by choice.

18:29.088 --> 18:32.463
A woman doesn't need a man
to feel good or be happy.

18:32.546 --> 18:33.546
I completely agree.

18:33.921 --> 18:34.963
What about you?

18:35.046 --> 18:37.505
Same. I don't need a man
to feel good or be happy.

18:45.380 --> 18:48.171
<i>As his Katie, his pretty Katie</i>

18:48.255 --> 18:50.671
<i>She just chucked him out</i>
<i>His Katie chucked him out</i>

18:50.755 --> 18:52.463
<i>And he's drawn a blank</i>

18:52.546 --> 18:56.880
<i>This old grand duke with his schemes</i>
<i>And his white Russian tips and tricks</i>

18:56.963 --> 18:59.630
<i>My tactic was tacky</i>
<i>Says Igor in a snore</i>

18:59.713 --> 19:02.421
<i>Blind drunk on the bar counter</i>

19:02.505 --> 19:03.921
<i>A white Russian feeling blue</i>

19:04.005 --> 19:06.671
<i>Strange stroke of fate!</i>
<i>The ribald revelers chuckle away</i>

19:06.755 --> 19:09.755
<i>Igor, once more, emits a snore</i>
<i>But here by his ear</i>

19:09.838 --> 19:12.713
<i>Marvel! It's a silver clock</i>
<i>Giving him hints and tips</i>

19:12.796 --> 19:14.296
<i>In his deep slumber</i>

19:14.380 --> 19:16.755
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock</i>
<i>Your Katie chucked you out</i>

19:16.838 --> 19:19.588
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock</i>
<i>Your Katie chucked you out</i>

19:19.671 --> 19:21.255
<i>Tick-tock, tick-tock...</i>

19:22.630 --> 19:24.255
It's crazy you know this song!

19:24.338 --> 19:25.296
Yeah?

19:25.380 --> 19:26.546
I love Boby Lapointe.

19:26.630 --> 19:27.630
I didn't know.

19:31.213 --> 19:34.130
Hurry up, it's freezing.
Enough with your cigarettes.

19:34.213 --> 19:35.213
All right!

19:39.088 --> 19:40.505
The guy knows Boby Lapointe.

19:40.588 --> 19:42.588
-Is he her secret brother?
-Huh?

19:43.213 --> 19:44.796
-What?
-I didn't know.

19:45.421 --> 19:47.713
-How would you?
-Yeah, no.

19:49.630 --> 19:52.546
Would you have sex on her dad's couch?
In the waiting room.

19:53.630 --> 19:55.255
-I don't know.
-Yes or no?

19:56.421 --> 19:58.505
-Yeah. After the consultations.
-Yeah?

19:58.588 --> 20:00.046
OK, perfect.

20:00.755 --> 20:04.005
Elsa won't have sex on the first date.
I told her not to.

20:04.088 --> 20:06.880
I'm sorry but not having sex
on the first date is whorish.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.380
It is.

20:08.463 --> 20:10.213
I'm freezing. Can we ditch the guys?

20:10.296 --> 20:11.671
-I'm shattered.
-Let's go.

20:18.838 --> 20:19.838
Sorry.

20:20.171 --> 20:21.880
Please. Shall I walk you home?

20:23.671 --> 20:25.463
No, I'm OK, I...

20:26.630 --> 20:29.713
-I can get home on my own, I'm a big girl.
-Are you sure?

20:30.713 --> 20:31.713
Was it that bad? I survived.

20:35.171 --> 20:36.296
No, but...

20:36.588 --> 20:37.630
let's speak soon?

20:38.838 --> 20:40.463
If you give me your number.

20:42.713 --> 20:44.463
It might use up too much space.

20:45.630 --> 20:48.130
-I've got yours, I'll call you.
-OK.

20:49.713 --> 20:50.921
Good night, Jules Dupont.

20:53.255 --> 20:54.505
Good night, Miss Piggy.

21:04.880 --> 21:06.171
Don't go that way!

21:06.796 --> 21:08.213
Are you thick, Amine? Why is he going that way?

21:10.963 --> 21:13.380
Look!
He's literally going around in circles!

21:13.463 --> 21:14.588
Look at that!

21:15.255 --> 21:17.546
Lighting a cigarette might make him come.

21:19.255 --> 21:21.755
-Crazy about the Nokia, right?
-Yeah.

21:21.838 --> 21:23.713
She went on about no iPhones and bam!

21:25.421 --> 21:28.130
He let her go so at least
he's not a psychopath.

21:29.963 --> 21:31.380
Ah, well done, Amine!

21:31.713 --> 21:32.796
Right, come on.

21:40.921 --> 21:43.171
No way. Such an idiot.

21:44.921 --> 21:45.921
Are you Emilie?

21:47.213 --> 21:48.671
About time, I don't have keys.

21:49.838 --> 21:52.630
Yeah, I had three castings in a day,
it's not...

21:53.171 --> 21:56.005
it's pretty intense but that's the job.

21:56.546 --> 21:59.213
Yeah. And I'm teaching drama in prisons.

22:00.796 --> 22:03.338
I'm a sponge so, emotionally, it's tough.

22:04.338 --> 22:06.755
The guys are scary but they have a heart.

22:07.921 --> 22:11.255
OK, I'll tell you all about it. See you!

22:13.130 --> 22:14.130
She's so silly. It was your mum.

22:16.838 --> 22:19.380
-She didn't want to talk to me?
-She likes me better.

22:19.921 --> 22:21.838
-Weren't you working tonight?
-Yes.

22:22.338 --> 22:23.796
-You're home early.
-Yeah.

22:24.921 --> 22:26.963
-Can you believe it?
-What?

22:27.671 --> 22:30.296
Well, nothing for two years...

22:30.838 --> 22:35.255
and the first guy who sticks around
for two minutes ticks all the boxes.

22:35.338 --> 22:37.296
Avoid the station. Waze isn't God.

22:39.046 --> 22:40.630
It's too good to be true.

22:41.630 --> 22:42.630
Right?

22:43.338 --> 22:45.921
Who knows where Cupid's arrows
will end up?

22:48.380 --> 22:49.755
Charlotte, look at me.

22:50.921 --> 22:53.880
-This traffic is such <i>mierda.</i>
-Charlotte, turn around.

22:54.338 --> 22:55.338
What? Spit it out.

22:58.255 --> 23:00.546
-Spit what out?
-I know you're lying.

23:01.921 --> 23:03.255
You're hiding something.

23:04.171 --> 23:05.380
You're being sneaky.

23:09.546 --> 23:11.171
You gave me a genius idea!

23:12.505 --> 23:14.921
<i>You</i> had a genius idea? OK, I'm scared.

23:15.005 --> 23:18.088
Remember when you said
you'd pay for Elsa to feel better?

23:19.255 --> 23:20.421
What have you done?

23:22.380 --> 23:23.380
A whore.

23:24.755 --> 23:27.130
-Who are we talking about?
-Jules! The guy.

23:27.213 --> 23:28.338
He's a man-whore.

23:30.130 --> 23:33.005
-I don't get it.
-He's here to save her. Shag her.

23:34.630 --> 23:38.046
Tell me you're joking. Now.
You're joking, right?

23:38.130 --> 23:39.130
You're joking?

23:39.213 --> 23:40.671
No, why?

23:41.088 --> 23:44.130
Hang on, he's not a real hooker.

23:44.588 --> 23:46.630
He's a high-class hooker.

23:46.713 --> 23:49.171
Maybe even a super-high-class hooker.
