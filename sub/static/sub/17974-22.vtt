(chuckles)

00:35.702 --> 00:37.202
What are you doing here?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.738
Had to return
some of mom's clothes.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.874
Me and the guys had some
high jinks that got canceled.

00:41.876 --> 00:42.975
Car looks good.

00:42.977 --> 00:45.978
It better.
Lowrider show's next weekend.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.813
The How Low Can You Low
Lowrider Convention?

00:47.815 --> 00:48.847
That's right.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.349
And this year, I think

00:50.351 --> 00:51.984
I'm gonna get a chance
to meet Diselle.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.318
Who's Diselle?

00:53.320 --> 00:54.853
Only the greatest
bikini car model

00:54.855 --> 00:56.021
to ever lean on a lowrider.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.257
She practically invented
bending over the hood.

00:58.259 --> 01:01.326
She sounds beautiful.

01:01.328 --> 01:03.562
I remember
the first time you went.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.865
Seems like it was
just yesterday.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.735
Dad, can I go with you
to the car show?

01:09.737 --> 01:11.537
No.
Okay.

01:11.539 --> 01:13.105
Can I help you
fix the car?

01:13.107 --> 01:14.173
No.

01:15.442 --> 01:16.875
Who's he?

01:16.877 --> 01:18.444
That's you when
you get older.

01:18.446 --> 01:19.878
Hi.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.080
Wait a minute.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.681
I'm talking to myself in 1977.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.217
Listen to me:
take $1,000--

01:25.219 --> 01:26.351
steal it if you have to--

01:26.353 --> 01:27.019
and buy Apple stock.

01:27.021 --> 01:28.187
Applesauce?

01:28.189 --> 01:30.856
No! Stock in Apple.

01:30.858 --> 01:31.957
It's a company.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.125
I'm buying applesauce.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.393
No!

01:34.395 --> 01:36.095
Dang.

01:36.097 --> 01:37.963
But I do like applesauce.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.865
Either way, good investment.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.133
Hand me that socket
wrench on the bench.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.401
Really?

01:42.403 --> 01:43.502
Just grab it for me.

01:47.307 --> 01:51.310
No, that's the bang-bang one.

01:54.080 --> 01:54.880
(sucking air through teeth)

01:58.151 --> 01:58.817
Thanks.

02:00.820 --> 02:01.587
He said, "Thanks"!

02:01.589 --> 02:04.723
And then?
And then?

02:04.725 --> 02:06.992
It's the first time
he's ever let me in.

02:06.994 --> 02:10.429
Not just into his garage
but into his life.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.065
We were building
that car together.

02:13.067 --> 02:16.635
If I didn't so expertly
hand him that socket wrench,

02:16.637 --> 02:18.804
who knows what would
have happened?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.506
Nothing?
Who cares?
Something?

02:20.508 --> 02:21.640
Look, I think it's nice

02:21.642 --> 02:22.341
that you two had
a moment today,

02:22.343 --> 02:24.409
but I don't want you...

02:24.411 --> 02:25.444
(cell phone rings)

02:25.446 --> 02:26.145
Oh, hey, Dad.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.947
I had fun today.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.015
I see.

02:30.017 --> 02:33.152
I am.

02:33.154 --> 02:34.419
I will.

02:34.421 --> 02:36.155
I were. Good-bye.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.456
(phone beeps)

02:37.458 --> 02:38.657
Oh, baby, what did he say?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.627
He was calling
to let me know

02:41.629 --> 02:44.530
(begins to yell):
that he's going
to the junkyard today

02:44.532 --> 02:45.764
and he wants me
to come along with him

02:45.766 --> 02:48.867
to help find parts
for the car,

02:48.869 --> 02:51.203
and I probably should have
started being louder

02:51.205 --> 02:53.472
later in the sentence,
but I don't care

02:53.474 --> 02:55.908
because in your face!

02:57.377 --> 03:00.512
Junior, it's pretty creepy

03:00.514 --> 03:01.647
that you still
come to this park.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.383
I like to come
for the 30 or 40

03:04.385 --> 03:06.885
simultaneous <i>quinceañeras</i>
<i>each weekend.</i>

03:06.887 --> 03:08.620
You'd be surprised
how much ownership

03:08.622 --> 03:10.656
they take
of a public space.

03:10.658 --> 03:11.390
(festive music playing)

03:11.392 --> 03:13.659
(grunting)

03:13.661 --> 03:15.294
(clanking and beeping
in distance)

03:15.296 --> 03:16.762
(beeping, whirring)

03:17.530 --> 03:19.831
Look at that dump truck.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.567
Look at that cement mixer.

03:21.569 --> 03:23.902
Oh, they got a
Broderson IC-80?

03:23.904 --> 03:25.404
(whistles)

03:25.406 --> 03:26.171
This is a big-money project.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.973
(glass breaks)

03:29.008 --> 03:30.876
(laughing)

03:30.878 --> 03:32.744
Why are you picking
on that one?

03:32.746 --> 03:34.580
That thing broke down
for the last time.

03:34.582 --> 03:36.248
We're getting rid of it.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.749
Now, if you'll excuse
us, we've got some

03:37.751 --> 03:40.786
late '80s <i>Playboys</i>
<i>to look at.</i>

03:42.488 --> 03:43.155
This is pretty cool.

03:43.157 --> 03:44.189
(engine starts)

03:44.191 --> 03:47.426
(screaming)

03:47.428 --> 03:48.093
Calm down, dumb-ass.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.195
I fixed it.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.830
Oh, no, no, yeah, yeah.

03:51.832 --> 03:53.265
So, how'd you do it?

03:53.267 --> 03:55.200
Every boy under
the age of seven

03:55.202 --> 03:58.503
knows everything about trucks
and dinosaurs.

03:58.505 --> 04:00.539
And then we forget it all
when we discover <i>Star Wars.</i>

04:00.541 --> 04:03.275
And later, boobies.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.243
Let's take it for a spin.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.511
But how do we get it
out of here?

04:06.513 --> 04:07.746
Leave that to me.

04:07.748 --> 04:08.513
I've got what doctors call

04:08.515 --> 04:10.616
a "fat, middle-aged,

04:10.618 --> 04:11.950
construction worker build."

04:14.721 --> 04:17.923
Hey, Mack.
Hey, Bub.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.025
I'm gonna take this
to get washed.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.760
Great. I'm gonna
sweat profusely

04:21.762 --> 04:23.128
and get very little done.

04:25.131 --> 04:27.633
(whooping)

04:27.635 --> 04:30.702
(laughing)

04:30.704 --> 04:32.771
(cat meows)

04:32.773 --> 04:34.539
A cat stuck in a tree?

04:34.541 --> 04:35.240
Aw, it looks scared.

04:35.242 --> 04:37.743
It's a scaredy cat.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.479
Oh, that's what that means.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.647
(meows)

04:41.649 --> 04:42.881
(cries)

04:45.585 --> 04:47.986
(Cleveland Jr. meowing)

04:50.556 --> 04:52.090
(meows)

04:52.092 --> 04:54.860
(both chuckle)

04:57.263 --> 04:58.230
Thank you, magical giraffe.

04:58.232 --> 05:00.999
(chuckling)

05:01.001 --> 05:02.801
Now, let's get this back
to the site and see

05:02.803 --> 05:05.804
if there's a jackhammer
we can pogo around town on.

05:05.806 --> 05:08.006
We're not taking
old Cherry back.

05:08.008 --> 05:10.809
You saw what she did.
She can help people!

05:10.811 --> 05:12.744
And I know exactly where
to hide her.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.182
Hey, Junior, now hide me!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.352
(chuckles)

05:20.354 --> 05:23.455
(sniffs)

05:23.457 --> 05:25.123
Aw, come on, dog.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.659
Why you gotta do me like that?

05:29.462 --> 05:30.495
Hello, Donna.

05:30.497 --> 05:33.365
I take it you two had
a good time?

05:33.367 --> 05:34.533
Who? My father and I?

05:34.535 --> 05:38.103
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
I suppose it was fun.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.540
But not as fun as we'll be
having next weekend

05:41.542 --> 05:45.677
when we go to the lowrider
convention together!

05:45.679 --> 05:47.145
Paced it right that time.

05:47.147 --> 05:48.647
He invited you?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.816
Something's real fishy here.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.883
This is the new
Freight Train.

05:51.885 --> 05:54.119
You're like a
stripper, Donna;

05:54.121 --> 05:56.054
you just won't
accept change.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.456
Dad! You want to come sit
in our marital bed?

05:57.458 --> 05:59.057
Scooch, woman!

05:59.059 --> 06:01.860
I hope I wasn't interrupting
anything.

06:01.862 --> 06:04.329
Nah. It's not Thursday evening
or Saturday after cartoons.

06:04.331 --> 06:05.530
You got any
peanut butter?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.633
Your mother won't let me keep
any in the house.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.335
Mom's stupid.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.971
I hate her and like you now.
Take what you want.

06:12.973 --> 06:14.806
Why didn't you just go
to the store?

06:14.808 --> 06:16.007
There's a peanut
butter store?

06:16.009 --> 06:17.976
Them squirrels
lied to me.

06:21.347 --> 06:24.583
Cleveland, your father's
acting very odd.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.885
Acting odd is what
made Jim Carrey a star

06:26.887 --> 06:27.319
for five years.

06:27.321 --> 06:29.654
Who?

06:29.656 --> 06:31.656
(phone rings)

06:31.658 --> 06:33.658
Hello? One second.

06:33.660 --> 06:35.093
Cleveland, wake up.

06:35.095 --> 06:39.030
Is it Saturday?!
Did I miss the cartoons?!

06:39.032 --> 06:39.598
I'm ready!

06:39.600 --> 06:40.832
It's your mother.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.734
Well, there goes
the 'rection.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.703
(sweetly):
Hi, Mommy.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.171
We'll be right there!

06:46.173 --> 06:47.773
(tires screech)

06:47.775 --> 06:48.874
Oh, thank God!
He's crazy!

06:48.876 --> 06:51.676
I don't know how he got
the peanut butter.

06:51.678 --> 06:53.111
I threw it all out.

06:53.113 --> 06:55.113
What's the peanut butter
all about?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.681
It's about protection!

06:56.683 --> 06:58.583
So they can't get
into my memories.

06:58.585 --> 07:00.185
Peanut butter
is nature's tinfoil.

07:00.187 --> 07:01.453
Who's they?

07:01.455 --> 07:03.922
Those damn octopuses
on the sky chariots.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.458
I don't see 'em.

07:06.460 --> 07:08.727
That's because there's
nothing there.

07:08.729 --> 07:11.129
Oh, thank God.
I thought I needed glasses.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.631
How stupid would
I look in glasses?

07:12.633 --> 07:17.269
(nerdy voice):
Uh, I added more RAM
to my floppy drive.

07:17.271 --> 07:19.237
I told you he was
acting crazy!

07:19.239 --> 07:20.372
Being so nice to you.

07:20.374 --> 07:21.406
LAVAR:
Watch out!

07:21.408 --> 07:23.875
Here come the octo-chariots
from Targzissia!

07:23.877 --> 07:27.078
Daddy gone Bonanzas.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.447
I'll blast 'em for you, Dad!

07:28.449 --> 07:30.415
Pyoo! Pyoo! I got 'em!

07:30.417 --> 07:32.050
You can come down now.

07:32.052 --> 07:33.785
Thank you
for saving my life.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.755
I love you, son.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.224
(Cleveland hums happily)

07:39.226 --> 07:42.761
Did you hear that?!
My dad says he loves me!

07:42.763 --> 07:46.431
All right, gotta go
light up my butt fuse
for extra power.

07:46.433 --> 07:47.966
Light it!

07:47.968 --> 07:49.301
I'm never gonna forget
this night.

07:55.274 --> 07:58.577
Well, as you can see,
the wall is blocked.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.278
That's why we're
not getting any flow.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.513
Could you remove the wall?

08:01.515 --> 08:04.115
Oh, I've thought of that,
but it's too risky.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.585
Unless I put
the steam shower here.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.787
Dr. Fist, can we talk about
Freight Train for a moment?

08:08.789 --> 08:11.690
Oh, I guess I'll continue

08:11.692 --> 08:14.793
to take regular showers
like some fat woman.

08:14.795 --> 08:18.096
His brain looks fine, so we
can rule out anything serious.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.931
That's good, right?
Oh, definitely.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.701
It means you can laugh out
loud at his mental illness

08:22.703 --> 08:25.036
and not have
to try to hide it.

08:25.038 --> 08:28.006
(EKG beeping)
Yeah, blow that jazz, daddy-o.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.474
(laughs)

08:29.476 --> 08:31.476
You see? What a lunatic.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.478
So then he can
come home?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.480
Unfortunately, we won't know
what's causing this

08:35.482 --> 08:38.016
until we get back
his toxicology report.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.151
Ah, here it is.
Thank you, Freddy.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.287
(reads to himself)

08:42.289 --> 08:45.323
Mr. Brown, were you
on heart medication?

08:45.325 --> 08:47.392
Yeah.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.561
And were you taking anything
for erectile dysfunction?

08:49.563 --> 08:50.996
I was ordering pills
online from Canada.

08:50.998 --> 08:53.064
Viagr-ehses.

08:53.066 --> 08:56.535
Uh-huh. And what about
the male enhancement
supplement ExtenZe?

08:56.537 --> 08:59.304
No. But I was taking the
generic version, LongerZe.

08:59.306 --> 09:01.640
I've also been taking
prenatal vitamins

09:01.642 --> 09:03.875
to make me younger,
stem cells from a shark,

09:03.877 --> 09:07.045
like Jason Street, and I ate
the DVD of  <i>Limitless.</i>

09:07.047 --> 09:09.347
Now I'm a karate man!
Hyuh! Wha-ah!

09:09.349 --> 09:11.049
Taxi!

09:11.051 --> 09:13.051
(EKG steady tone)

09:13.053 --> 09:14.853
Well, it's just
as I suspected.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.989
Your father created
a dangerous cocktail of drugs.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.691
You see, they're like
22-year-old girls;

09:19.693 --> 09:21.359
individually they'll do
wonders for you,

09:21.361 --> 09:23.828
but when you put them all
together in the back

09:23.830 --> 09:26.197
of a limo to Atlantic City,
you're liable to go crazy.

09:26.199 --> 09:26.865
Do you do that?

09:26.867 --> 09:30.068
I make a lot of money.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.070
Well, from now on,
he can't take any
more medication.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.073
That should get him
back to normal.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.043
So, if he stops now, how long
till he's back to normal?

09:38.045 --> 09:40.278
Two or three days.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.049
Until then, I recommend he be
placed in, oh, you know, um...

09:44.051 --> 09:46.551
Do you remember, in the  <i>Batman</i>
<i>movies, where the Joker lived?</i>

09:46.553 --> 09:49.120
We never saw
his primary residence.

09:49.122 --> 09:51.089
He's talking about
the nuthouse, Cleveland.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.224
No! No nut!

09:53.226 --> 09:55.293
I'll take care of
him in my house.

09:55.295 --> 09:56.461
What?!

09:56.463 --> 09:58.129
No what!
Don't you see?

09:58.131 --> 09:59.097
I've got to cram all
the father-son bonding

09:59.099 --> 10:02.100
we never had
into three days,

10:02.102 --> 10:04.135
and then when he's
back to normal,

10:04.137 --> 10:05.070
he'll remember
how good it felt.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.538
Let's get back
to our game.

10:06.540 --> 10:07.939
Duck. Duck.

10:07.941 --> 10:11.476
Duck. Duck.
Goose!

10:11.478 --> 10:14.079
(yelling gibberish)

10:14.081 --> 10:15.714
(laughs)
Can't be beat!

10:15.716 --> 10:17.949
25 and six!

10:22.421 --> 10:24.723
Rallo, this town needs us.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.327
See that right there?

10:29.329 --> 10:31.262
That's a Frisbee-brand
flying disc

10:31.264 --> 10:33.732
a boy probably lost
two years ago.

10:33.734 --> 10:34.966
And there's a teddy bear,
no doubt thrown up there

10:34.968 --> 10:37.636
by a mean older brother.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.070
And isn't that
your friend Murray?

10:39.072 --> 10:40.939
Hey, Rallo!

10:40.941 --> 10:44.509
Yeah, he likes to stare at
the college dorms
from up there.

10:44.511 --> 10:46.411
We're the only ones
who can help them.

10:46.413 --> 10:49.481
And we've got nothing...
else... to do.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.120
I'm back!

10:55.122 --> 10:56.354
(in deep voice):
For revenge!

10:56.356 --> 10:57.455
(gasps)

10:57.457 --> 10:58.590
(giggling)

10:58.592 --> 11:00.358
I'm kidding.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.327
I've been to Heaven.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.362
It's beautiful!

11:11.637 --> 11:13.938
GIRL:
My Frisbee!

11:13.940 --> 11:17.042
And broken glass!

11:17.044 --> 11:19.611
Thank you, Magical Giraffe!

11:19.613 --> 11:23.782
(laughs)
I, uh, I-I was
waving my wiener

11:23.784 --> 11:27.018
at police helicopters,
and I fell asleep.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.267
(engine idling)

11:46.839 --> 11:50.308
(engine revving)

11:54.146 --> 11:57.582
How's it going
with your dad?

11:57.584 --> 12:00.018
Why don't you check the
video I posted to UTube

12:00.020 --> 12:02.320
just now and see?

12:04.690 --> 12:06.825
Nice throw, son!

12:06.827 --> 12:09.427
Thanks, Dad!

12:09.429 --> 12:11.596
(cooing)

12:18.704 --> 12:20.972
They're gaining on us!
Here, I'll help you!

12:23.242 --> 12:24.242
Now we shave down there.

12:26.445 --> 12:28.213
Wow, this has
10,000 views?

12:28.215 --> 12:30.048
I can't stop
watching it.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.716
FREIGHT TRAIN:
Look out the window!

12:31.718 --> 12:32.751
Rallo and Junior are
riding a magical giraffe!

12:32.753 --> 12:34.986
Love you, Crazy!

12:36.522 --> 12:37.521
That's right.

12:37.523 --> 12:39.591
You get a shiny coat this way.

12:39.593 --> 12:41.559
You know
who else has a shiny coat?

12:41.561 --> 12:44.863
Steve Harvey. Mm-hmm.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.765
And I bought you a lifetime
supply of Turtle Wax--

12:46.767 --> 12:49.734
one bottle.

12:49.736 --> 12:50.935
(truck engine approaching)

12:50.937 --> 12:52.771
We got company.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.773
The construction company,
specifically.

12:57.243 --> 13:00.278
Those big hairy brutes
want to take my Cherry!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.280
Hold on, let's see if
it's just two kids
who stole a truck.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.449
Nope. Uh-oh.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.085
Yes?

13:07.087 --> 13:09.053
Good afternoon, ma'am.

13:09.055 --> 13:11.756
I'm a construction worker,
so first of all,
nice cans, toots.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.958
Well, thank you.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.494
Second of all,
are these your sons?

13:16.496 --> 13:18.830
Son and stepson, yes. Why?

13:18.832 --> 13:21.065
They stole a cherry picker
from our site,

13:21.067 --> 13:23.802
and we need it back
so we can junk it. (chuckles)

13:23.804 --> 13:25.570
That thing's worth more
scrapped than alive.

13:25.572 --> 13:29.007
I think I'd notice
a stolen truck around here.

13:29.009 --> 13:31.509
I'm the head of this
household, and
I pay attention to...

13:31.511 --> 13:33.578
Bye, Mom.
Off to the library.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.346
Study hard.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.514
Look, lady,
where are your boys right now?

13:36.516 --> 13:39.017
Well, they're out back
playing in the tree house

13:39.019 --> 13:40.819
that we've never had.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.854
And now it's gone!

13:42.856 --> 13:43.521
(grunting)

13:47.293 --> 13:49.027
Drive, Rallo!

13:49.029 --> 13:52.030
Drive till your thumb
and forefinger ache!

13:53.599 --> 13:54.999
I'm up high!

13:55.001 --> 13:56.568
BOTH:
So are we!

13:58.604 --> 14:00.772

14:03.777 --> 14:05.844

14:05.846 --> 14:08.112
I didn't know any songs
with "lowrider" in it.

14:08.114 --> 14:11.816
But, re-irregardless,
the car show is today.

14:11.818 --> 14:14.419
And don't worry. I got
plenty of peanut butter
for protection.

14:15.888 --> 14:19.324
Peanut butter?! Do I look
like George Washington Carver?

14:19.326 --> 14:20.959
I don't know.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.661
Hmm. Kind of.

14:23.663 --> 14:25.396
Huh. I should remember
that for Halloween.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.899
Out of my way, dummy.
Dummy?!

14:27.901 --> 14:29.868
Why are you repeating
what I'm saying, fatty?

14:29.870 --> 14:31.870
Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fuh-Fatty?!
Oh, no!

14:31.872 --> 14:37.075
My fuh-fuh-fuh-father's
regained his
fuh-fuh-fuh-fuh sanity.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.076
Well, this is not going
to make our trip

14:38.078 --> 14:39.377
as much fun, but...

14:39.379 --> 14:42.213

14:55.662 --> 14:58.396
all the brothers and sisters
and that one white guy,

14:58.398 --> 14:59.597
who are competing
for the chance

14:59.599 --> 15:02.867
to be crowned
the Lowest of the Low.

15:02.869 --> 15:06.838
If you think that's you, then
raise 'em where I can see 'em.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.190
Broke the door.

15:26.192 --> 15:28.293
Got to Luke Duke it
in and out of here.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.794
Cleveland, what the
hell are you doing here?

15:29.796 --> 15:30.862
I'm entering my car.

15:30.864 --> 15:34.132
Check out my grill--
George Foreman.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.934
Plugged it into the battery.

15:35.936 --> 15:38.069
Hit a couple rabbits
on the way here.

15:38.071 --> 15:40.204
Ate 'em.
Don't feel well.

15:40.206 --> 15:42.240
What is tetanus?

15:42.242 --> 15:43.942
You don't belong here.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.444
But I love lowriders,
just like you.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.414
Matter of fact,
I hope we see a Highyunday,

15:49.416 --> 15:52.216
a K.I.A., a Chee-vai...

15:52.218 --> 15:53.451
(grunts)
Yeah, yeah.

15:53.453 --> 15:57.422
Or maybe a Mazz-da,
or a Fard,

15:57.424 --> 16:00.158
a Cahdillick,
a Suh-tern,

16:00.160 --> 16:02.927

how to say "pickup truck!"

16:05.265 --> 16:07.632
Look at all those corses.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.167
Cleveland, I don't
want you here.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.169
I came here without
you for a reason.

16:11.171 --> 16:13.237
You suck and I
can't stand you.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.672
That's two reasons.

I don't know.

16:30.356 --> 16:31.522

What?

16:31.524 --> 16:34.625

Oh, God, they found us.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.434
Those blue-collar maniacs
are after the property

16:43.436 --> 16:45.470
we stole from them!

16:45.472 --> 16:47.572

are coming after us! Let's go!

17:07.293 --> 17:09.627
What's happening?
We're running
out of gas.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.996
If only that would happen
to you.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.364
I know.

Hey, Jack, quick
cost-benefit analysis.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.241
What happens if
we crush the kids?

17:57.243 --> 17:58.843
PR nightmare
for two weeks,

17:58.845 --> 18:01.079
then America returns
to watching <i>The Voice.</i>

18:01.081 --> 18:03.781
Still, some
of those kids are ours.

18:03.783 --> 18:04.949
All right, kids, you've
got your Magical Giraffe.

18:04.951 --> 18:10.621

18:10.623 --> 18:13.891

18:13.893 --> 18:17.895
It was a long, short
road to get here, but we
did something.

18:17.897 --> 18:21.199
You're right, Junior.
We really...

18:21.201 --> 18:22.667
did something.

18:26.638 --> 18:31.409
All right, give it up
for Gus the Bartender!

18:31.411 --> 18:33.377
I don't have hydraulics.

18:33.379 --> 18:35.480
Those were ghosts in there.

18:35.482 --> 18:40.418
Now give it up
for our next contestant,
Mr. Cleveland Brown!

18:40.420 --> 18:42.386

Cleveland, what
are you doing here?

18:42.388 --> 18:44.288
I thought I told
you to go home.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.592
Yeah, well, my lowrider's
gonna beat your lowrider.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.161
I paid a couple
of laughing Mexican guys

18:50.163 --> 18:52.630
to soup up my Dadge Strotus.

18:52.632 --> 18:53.831
Huh? How about that?

18:53.833 --> 18:58.569

"The Sports Bra." Bounce!

18:58.571 --> 19:01.339

19:38.344 --> 19:40.144
I ain't waiting on them!

19:40.146 --> 19:42.180
Oh, but, Freight Train,
if you leave now,

19:42.182 --> 19:44.649
you'll be
disqualified!

19:44.651 --> 19:46.717
I was almost
disqualified already,

19:46.719 --> 19:49.187
but my boy didn't give up on
me and put me in the nuthouse.

19:49.189 --> 19:51.689
He took me into his home,
cared for me,

19:51.691 --> 19:53.891
bath'd me, washed
what made him.

19:53.893 --> 19:57.361
And I'm not
gonna give up on him.

19:57.363 --> 19:59.063
This is the first time
I've ever picked up my boy.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.232
(grunting)

20:01.234 --> 20:02.967
(panting)

20:02.969 --> 20:04.235
Damn, he's fat!

20:04.237 --> 20:05.770
(grunting)

20:08.006 --> 20:09.507
Is this the lowrider?

20:09.509 --> 20:12.910
But... but it's a show car.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.245
Then let's show 'em
what it can do.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.748
(tires squealing)

20:17.750 --> 20:19.417
Diselle!

20:19.419 --> 20:21.219
I finally got
her on my hood.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.221
Oh, well.

20:23.223 --> 20:25.456
(whimpering, panting)

20:29.695 --> 20:31.062
(boing)

20:34.733 --> 20:37.235
(rhythmic beeping)
Where am I?

20:37.237 --> 20:38.936
In the hospital.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.205
Good. How did I get here?

20:41.207 --> 20:43.207
Wait. Did you drive me here?

20:43.209 --> 20:44.942
What?! That's plumb dumb.

20:44.944 --> 20:47.111
I had a auto show to win. See?

20:47.113 --> 20:51.115
If I drove you,
how could I have won this?

20:51.117 --> 20:53.684
That's clearly
a homemade prize you made.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.420
Shut up, fool!
You drove me.
