.

00:01.302 --> 00:02.136
- Been trying to figure out
how to tell you

00:03.337 --> 00:05.639
that I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

00:05.639 --> 00:06.640
- Olinsky here.

00:06.640 --> 00:07.675
- My name's Michelle.

00:07.675 --> 00:08.909
My mom's Linda Sovana.

00:08.909 --> 00:10.111
Said you could help.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.212
- I don't know
what Linda told you.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.314
- I guess you're my dad.

00:13.314 --> 00:16.384
- Every cop I know
goes through a bad patch.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.253
- All I did was party
a little too hard.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.488
- Whatever you got going on,

00:20.488 --> 00:22.156
know that I'm looking
out for you.

00:22.156 --> 00:26.694
- Be a good thing for you
to give Erin some space.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.329
- Let's go to work.

00:28.329 --> 00:29.763
- Actually, I quit.

- Bianca.

00:45.746 --> 00:49.083
I came
as soon as you called.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.985
- Shouldn't have called you.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.623
Don't know what I was thinking.

00:58.126 --> 01:01.929
I just know he doesn't
want me no more.

01:01.929 --> 01:05.266
- If Benji's cheating on you
with someone else, forget him.

01:07.568 --> 01:10.271
- I'm tired of this life,
Antonio.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.474
- I can help you.

01:13.474 --> 01:16.677
But you got to help me
and tell me where Benji is.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.046
- Just so you can
go after his brother?

01:19.046 --> 01:20.047
Then what?

01:20.047 --> 01:22.316
- Then they both go away
for a long time.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.784
We'll help you start over.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.591
- You telling the truth?

01:30.591 --> 01:33.261
- I swear.

01:38.199 --> 01:39.567
That's it.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.602
One step at a time.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.637
- [crying]

01:45.773 --> 01:47.040
- Good morning, ladies.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.242
This is Benji Keyes,

01:48.242 --> 01:49.943
known on the street
as Benji Bones.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.612
Priors for possession
with intent to distribute,

01:51.612 --> 01:52.946
concealed weapon,

01:52.946 --> 01:55.416
and has been ID'd as a
street captain for his brother.

01:55.416 --> 01:57.185
- Derek Keyes:

01:57.185 --> 01:59.187
number one
on Chicago's most wanted.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.988
Narcotics estimates

02:00.988 --> 02:03.457
that over half the city's
heroin comes from Keyes.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.393
Been after him for years.

02:05.393 --> 02:07.094
Every time
they send in undercovers,

02:07.094 --> 02:08.196
they hit a wall.

02:08.196 --> 02:10.464
- CI of mine gave up
a location on Benji Bones.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.366
We grab him,
he'll lead us to Derek.

02:12.366 --> 02:14.535
- This can't
be a typical grab,

02:14.535 --> 02:16.404
'cause if Derek finds out
we're onto him,

02:16.404 --> 02:18.105
he'll dive deeper underground.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.773
So we got to extract
Benji Bones

02:19.773 --> 02:22.543
without anybody knowing.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.945
That means everybody
gets blacked out.

02:24.945 --> 02:26.480
- Sarge.
- Yeah?

02:26.480 --> 02:29.016
- Curious, have you--
- No.

02:29.016 --> 02:32.019
- We traded a few texts
a couple weeks back.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.987
You think
I should reach out?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.923
- She made her choice.

- Who's that?

04:52.393 --> 04:52.526
.

04:53.794 --> 04:54.495
- You know what I see
sitting there?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.499
That's enough pure,
uncut H

04:58.499 --> 05:02.102
to send you downstate
for a class X.

05:02.102 --> 05:03.804
That's 30 years.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.606
- You know what
I haven't seen yet?

05:05.606 --> 05:06.807
A warrant.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.076
- Listen, Benji.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.578
I can put a case on you,

05:10.578 --> 05:12.913
make a lot of people
who sign my checks happy.

05:12.913 --> 05:16.016
You're a big catch.

05:16.016 --> 05:18.519
We're looking
to hook a whale.

05:18.519 --> 05:21.722
- Your brother Derek's a real
old-school gangster, isn't he?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.757
Doesn't use phones,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.192
only does business
face-to-face,

05:25.192 --> 05:26.894
and that's if you're
in his inner circle.

05:26.894 --> 05:30.263
- Like you are.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.766
- You hear that?

05:32.766 --> 05:34.234
Sounds like I ain't got
nothing to say

05:34.234 --> 05:35.769
until my lawyer shows up.

05:35.769 --> 05:38.472
- What about
your companion?

05:38.472 --> 05:41.409
Maybe he'll talk.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.478
- Nah, man,
he don't know nothing.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.616
- Oh, Aaron Whittles.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.518
You are 25.

05:50.518 --> 05:53.220
Priors for possession
and misdemeanor theft.

05:53.220 --> 05:54.455
[chuckles]

05:54.455 --> 05:56.289
I...

05:56.289 --> 05:57.658
I'm a little confused.

05:57.658 --> 06:00.193
These are bad decisions
anyone could have made, Aaron.

06:00.193 --> 06:04.498
So why did we snag you up
with Benji Keyes?

06:04.498 --> 06:05.833
- We're just friends.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.300
- Ah, well...

06:07.300 --> 06:09.236
I think you're more than that.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.576
Listen...

06:15.576 --> 06:18.946
I'm not one to judge.

06:18.946 --> 06:22.450
You know, if I knew anything
about relationships,

06:22.450 --> 06:25.118
I wouldn't have lived
in my garage ten years.

06:27.054 --> 06:31.492
So there's no--
no need to feel ashamed.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.468
- I'm not.

06:40.468 --> 06:41.735
He is.

06:41.735 --> 06:42.736
- Listen, Benji.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.337
I got no problem,
you want to step out

06:44.337 --> 06:47.875
on your old lady
with another guy.

06:47.875 --> 06:49.643
I only care--hey.

06:49.643 --> 06:52.045
I only care
about one thing.

06:52.045 --> 06:56.283
You serve up Derek,

06:56.283 --> 06:58.351
I'll let Aaron walk.

07:05.659 --> 07:10.163
- If I serve up Derek,
you let both of us walk.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.608
- Oh, man.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.909
- Ah.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.545
[indistinct chatter]

07:32.385 --> 07:36.356
Let me guess,
you had Mouse ping my phone?

07:36.356 --> 07:38.692
- You know Voight put you
on three weeks furlough, right?

07:38.692 --> 07:40.594
In case you change your mind.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.030
That ends tomorrow.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.870
- What do you want, Jay?

07:49.870 --> 07:53.641
- I want to hear you
say it.

07:53.641 --> 07:54.875
- Say what?

08:00.147 --> 08:03.016
- That you're
no longer my partner,

08:03.016 --> 08:07.120
that you're
throwing it all away.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.922
Look me in the eye.
Tell me it's over.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.965
- Are you done talking?

08:20.367 --> 08:22.435
- I don't know
who you are,

08:22.435 --> 08:25.573
but tell Lindsay
she made me a better cop,

08:25.573 --> 08:27.675
if you ever see her again.

08:41.453 --> 08:45.425
- Hey, Olinsky,
you got a sec?

08:45.425 --> 08:46.927
Okay, so I got
my cup of coffee.

08:46.927 --> 08:47.995
I got my "Times."

08:47.995 --> 08:49.096
And like every morning,

08:49.096 --> 08:50.764
I like to read
the sports page

08:50.764 --> 08:53.333
before the calls come
pouring in.

08:53.333 --> 08:56.203
But today I can
barely read a word,

08:56.203 --> 08:57.671
because this girl,

08:57.671 --> 09:00.140
Michelle Sovana
from juvenile detention,

09:00.140 --> 09:02.242
keeps calling for you.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.243
- Just give me the number.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.377
I'll take care of it.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.713
- Al, she's been
calling for weeks.

09:05.713 --> 09:06.980
Obviously you don't
want to handle it.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.348
What's going on?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.317
It can't be that bad.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.288
- A long time ago,
I slept with this woman

09:15.288 --> 09:17.057
when I was undercover.

09:17.057 --> 09:21.061
Turns out
this Michelle is...

09:21.061 --> 09:24.665
my daughter.

09:24.665 --> 09:25.899
- Wow.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.068
- And the mom
is about to do four years

09:28.068 --> 09:30.638
for embezzlement.

09:30.638 --> 09:35.475
And I don't know
what to do with her.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.477
- Wow.

09:37.477 --> 09:39.847
- Yeah.

09:42.382 --> 09:45.452
You have a friend who works
in juvenile detention, right?

09:45.452 --> 09:48.455
- Yeah, Beatrice Mulaney.
- Good.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.157
- I'll--I'll take care of it.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.261
- What's up, Sarge?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.664
- Nothing.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.766
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask.

09:58.766 --> 09:59.900
You and Boy Wonder,

09:59.900 --> 10:02.035
you settle
on a wedding planner yet?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.637
- Oh, uh, no.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.972
I mean,
I've been asking around.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.373
I haven't found anybody yet,
so it's--

10:06.373 --> 10:09.843
- Good, I'll do it.

10:09.843 --> 10:10.911
- What the hell is that?

10:10.911 --> 10:13.847
- My wedding planner
from when I was engaged.

10:13.847 --> 10:16.616
- To what?

10:16.616 --> 10:17.918
- Tiger Beat,
go get some coffee.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.153
This is girl talk.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.154
- Have fun.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.589
- Hey--

10:22.589 --> 10:23.791
- Look at this dress.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.593
Isn't it gorgeous?

10:26.593 --> 10:28.862
- It's beautiful.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.798
The ad says Woolworth's.

10:30.798 --> 10:32.532
I think they went
out of business.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.702
- Burgess, dreams never
go out of business.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.738
Ever.

10:37.738 --> 10:38.739
Go ahead, take this.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.773
We'll talk later.

10:39.773 --> 10:40.974
- I couldn't possibly--
- Take it.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.310
- No, I could--it's so--
- Take it, Burgess.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.179
- Thanks.

10:48.381 --> 10:49.683
- [exhales]

10:49.683 --> 10:52.352
Okay, here we go.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.987
Who is
that handsome devil?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.622
- All right, 100 grand
in small bills

10:55.622 --> 10:57.958
from the 1505 fund, baby.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.259
- I look like Mr. Uptown
or what?

10:59.259 --> 11:00.527
- You look the part.

11:00.527 --> 11:01.829
- Yo, Adam.
- Yeah.

11:01.829 --> 11:02.996
- How come I ain't
heard nothing

11:02.996 --> 11:04.297
about a bachelor party yet?

11:04.297 --> 11:06.199
- Burgess and I haven't
even set a date yet, Kev.

11:06.199 --> 11:08.301
- That's because
you need a party.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.738
The party's
the most important part.

11:10.738 --> 11:11.905
- Correction:
nothing happens

11:11.905 --> 11:14.107
without a best man.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.110
What do you say?

11:17.110 --> 11:18.611
- Wait, like, me?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.580
- Yeah, why not?

11:20.580 --> 11:22.015
- I'd be honored, bro.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.016
- All right.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.051
- For real, man.

11:24.051 --> 11:25.786
- It's on, all right.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.588
- Okay, here we go.

11:28.588 --> 11:31.458
Benji just confirmed
the location of the meet.

11:31.458 --> 11:34.394
He's gonna intro Halstead
to Derek as a potential buyer

11:34.394 --> 11:36.864
who can expand his market
into the North Side.

11:36.864 --> 11:40.167
We get a deal on camera,
we'll move in.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.534
- Where's the meet?

11:41.534 --> 11:43.236
- Main terminal at Midway.

11:43.236 --> 11:44.371
- That's a lot of moving parts.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.073
Planes, trains, vehicles,

11:46.073 --> 11:48.008
and the no-fly zone
over the airport.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.409
- Hey, it's Derek Keyes.

11:49.409 --> 11:50.543
We'll make it work.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.779
- That's right.

11:51.779 --> 11:53.446
Let's do it.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.348
- Your brother better be here.

11:55.348 --> 11:56.483
- My man, he will.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.485
- All right, let's go.

12:08.628 --> 12:11.431
- Is that camera
up and running yet?

12:11.431 --> 12:12.432
- Yeah, sir.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.868
We got audiovisual
up and running.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.455
- Who was that?

12:35.455 --> 12:36.990
- Sarge, you want
one of us to follow that guy?

12:36.990 --> 12:39.126
- No, stay with Halstead.

12:39.126 --> 12:42.162
[indistinct chatter]

12:55.508 --> 12:56.643
- Yo, this wasn't the plan.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.348
- Listen.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.649
You want to meet Derek.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.852
It could be now or never.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.422

I'm rolling with this.

- Yeah.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.188
Like I said,
he got heavy paper.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.893
- Benji says you used to ride
with the Belz brothers.

13:45.893 --> 13:47.060
- For a minute,

13:47.060 --> 13:49.096
up in Bucktown.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.331
- Those crazy white boys
still riding around

13:51.331 --> 13:54.201
with chainsaws in their trunks?

13:54.201 --> 13:55.735
- That's, uh, tradition.

13:55.735 --> 13:56.904
But I'm looking to stake

13:56.904 --> 13:58.906
a little piece of the world
for myself.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.311
- Where'd you disappear to
last night?

14:04.311 --> 14:06.146
- What?

14:06.146 --> 14:08.448
I was home, man.

14:08.448 --> 14:10.517
- This one told
a different story.

14:10.517 --> 14:13.620
[man groaning]

14:13.620 --> 14:17.057
- Your bodyguard says you
disappeared for a couple hours.

14:19.326 --> 14:23.296
Funny thing is,
you forgot to put your shoes on.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.731
- Are we gonna do
business here,

14:24.731 --> 14:27.200
or are we gonna settle
a family dispute?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.943
- Come on, man,
what, are you gonna rob me?

14:35.943 --> 14:37.344
- We got a gun.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.018
- Come on, brother.

15:14.414 --> 15:16.416
- Listen, listen,
we're CPD intelligence.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.752
We got a guy
beyond this checkpoint.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.254
- We got to get through now.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.689
Now!

15:22.689 --> 15:24.224
- Let them through.

15:36.136 --> 15:37.404
- Body!

- Central CPD Intelligence,

15:43.210 --> 15:45.212
we got a DOA.

- Sarge.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.295
- Yeah.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.396
- This came from my CI.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.431
I'll take the hit.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.066
- Where we at
with the SUV?

16:06.066 --> 16:08.135
- We've got all available
patrol units searching.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.636
Problem is,
there's no plates.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.404
- Well, what about
the TSA badges

16:11.404 --> 16:13.073
they used
to get past security?

16:13.073 --> 16:15.742
- The badges were stolen from
several employees yesterday.

16:15.742 --> 16:19.479
TSA didn't report them missing
until this morning.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.947
- Keyes shot and killed
his own brother.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.882
What do you think
he's gonna do to Halstead?

16:27.387 --> 16:29.389
- Man, this thing
with Halstead.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.891
You imagine
if it was Adam?

16:31.891 --> 16:32.892
- No.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.861
Roman, why would you
even ask that?

16:34.861 --> 16:36.296
- Look, I know
since you put the ring on,

16:36.296 --> 16:37.964
it's been all high fives
and congrats,

16:37.964 --> 16:40.733
but you really think
this is smart?

16:40.733 --> 16:41.901

16:41.901 --> 16:43.603
who fell in love
with three ex-partners, right?

16:43.603 --> 16:45.638
- Exactly,
ex being the operative word.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.108
You got to be half nuts
to do this job to begin with.

in his own brother's head.

He won't think twice
about killing you.

for this to happen.

where Derek Keyes is.

I never met him.

- Hank.

I'm sorry,
I don't mean to interrupt,

to give this to you.

that doesn't get found.

you can give me

23:42.922 --> 23:45.324

you something, Hank.

every morning,

23:54.166 --> 23:58.204
do you thank God or me?

23:58.204 --> 24:00.507
- I haven't forgotten
what you did for me.

24:00.507 --> 24:03.242
- What I did was make
a lot of enemies,

24:03.242 --> 24:04.911
protecting a cop.

24:04.911 --> 24:06.579

you'd want more

than a carton
of cigarettes.

that we talked about...

- Okay.

Let me ask around,

24:38.377 --> 24:40.613

dig up for you on Keyes.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.019

with the CI files?

24:47.019 --> 24:50.422
- All set, bogus CI numbers
and criminal histories.

We used photographs
of inmates

till the drop.

- Keyes requested
a female officer

25:13.746 --> 25:16.448
deliver the files.

25:16.448 --> 25:20.319
- No, you find somebody else.

25:20.319 --> 25:22.254
- You got a funny way
of saying, "Yes, sir."

25:22.254 --> 25:24.356
- There is no way
I'm losing a partner

25:24.356 --> 25:25.357
and my fiancÃ©e
on the same day--

25:25.357 --> 25:27.393
- I said, get Burgess.

25:27.393 --> 25:30.296
- Hey, I'll pull up Rivera
from patrol.

25:30.296 --> 25:32.031
- I'll do it.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.270
- Get her out of here.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.271
- Hank...

25:39.271 --> 25:40.506
- You gave your star back.

25:40.506 --> 25:41.741
Or don't you remember?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.375
- Can we talk?

25:43.375 --> 25:44.744
- You know, you made it clear
which direction

25:44.744 --> 25:47.246
you want to go in,
which is down.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.480
I've accepted that.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.481
Now get out.

25:49.481 --> 25:51.217
- This isn't about me.

25:51.217 --> 25:54.654
This is about
getting Jay back.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.222
This guy wants
a female courier.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.325
You and I both know
it should be me.

25:59.325 --> 26:04.664
- You here as a cop
or to save your boyfriend?

26:04.664 --> 26:06.699
- Does it matter?

26:26.719 --> 26:28.988
- I keep thinking--

26:28.988 --> 26:32.692
I mean, I keep--
I keep thinking...

26:35.461 --> 26:38.330
This never
would have happened

26:38.330 --> 26:43.435
if I had another pair of eyes
at Midway, your eyes.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.503
Then I'm not watching Halstead

26:44.503 --> 26:46.773
being tortured
like an animal.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.142
- I'm asking you.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.044
Let me make this right.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.384
I will do the drop.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.095
- This isn't you reinstated.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.597
You understand?

27:11.597 --> 27:14.266
This is just for today.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.346
Gear up.

27:34.787 --> 27:37.724
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.391
- It's ceramic.

27:39.391 --> 27:40.727
It's not much, but, you know,

27:40.727 --> 27:42.895
at least you won't be
going in naked.

27:42.895 --> 27:46.032
And it won't set off
any detectors if they wand you.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.134
- Al, thank you.

27:48.134 --> 27:49.601
- Yeah.

27:54.140 --> 27:57.143
[dramatic music]

27:57.143 --> 28:05.251
*

28:30.309 --> 28:32.078
- All right,
target's on scene.

28:32.078 --> 28:33.379
Stay cool.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.296
- You got what Derek wants?

28:50.296 --> 28:53.032
- That's all
of the Intelligence CI files.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.333
Where's Jay?

28:54.333 --> 28:56.335
- Let's say you hand over
those files.

28:56.335 --> 28:57.937
We verify them.

28:57.937 --> 28:59.806
Then we'll
cut your boy loose.

28:59.806 --> 29:02.341
- That wasn't the deal.

29:02.341 --> 29:04.110
Derek said the files
for our guy.

29:04.110 --> 29:05.577
He said a straight trade.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.182
[gun clicks]

29:10.182 --> 29:12.384
- Hey, we got a gun,
passenger side.

29:12.384 --> 29:13.385
We got a gun.

29:13.385 --> 29:16.555
- Hold steady until I say.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.557
- If I don't see Jay
alive right now,

29:18.557 --> 29:20.359
I'm walking with the box.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.198
- Guess you're going
for a ride.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.481
- Should we move in?

29:42.481 --> 29:43.649
- Negative.

29:43.649 --> 29:44.984
There's no Halstead.

29:44.984 --> 29:46.652
- All right, all right, copy,
we'll pursue.

29:46.652 --> 29:50.156
- No, I said we hold back.

29:56.963 --> 29:57.096
.

29:57.897 --> 29:58.330
- Talk to me, Mouse.

29:59.731 --> 30:01.400
- I was able to pick up the SUV
on several plate readers,

30:01.400 --> 30:02.869
but because the vehicle
is moving,

30:02.869 --> 30:04.203
the updates are coming in
five minutes behind.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.637
- What about Air One?

30:05.637 --> 30:07.773
- They positively ID'd
the SUV on Mouse's intel,

30:07.773 --> 30:09.909
but the signal got lost
under the Wabash L train.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.844
- Look, it's not gonna be long
before Derek figures out

30:11.844 --> 30:14.413
the files I made are fake.

30:14.413 --> 30:17.449
[phone buzzing]

30:19.551 --> 30:20.987
- Voight.

30:20.987 --> 30:23.122
This is a call from Stateville
Correctional Facility.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.123
Will you accept?

30:24.123 --> 30:25.691
- Yes, I will.

30:27.359 --> 30:29.728
- Go ahead, please.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.663
- Tell me you got something,
Eddie.

30:31.663 --> 30:33.332
- Turns out there's a guy
in the next block

30:33.332 --> 30:34.867
named Tyrell Chase.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.035
- Okay.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.004
Con named Tyrell Chase.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.538
All right, go ahead.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.507
- Screws tell me
that he used to be

30:41.507 --> 30:44.076
a street captain for Keyes,

30:44.076 --> 30:46.445
till he got popped for murder;
now he's doing life.

30:46.445 --> 30:50.950
Supposedly, one of Keyes' men
comes by every few months,

30:50.950 --> 30:53.352
drops a couple grand
in his canteen account.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.221
Payoff money.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.822
- Thanks, Eddie.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.627
[dramatic music]

31:01.627 --> 31:09.735
*

31:11.403 --> 31:13.105
- Boss.

31:14.440 --> 31:17.443
We got a guest.

31:17.443 --> 31:18.945
She wouldn't hand over
the files

31:18.945 --> 31:21.080
unless she saw her boy.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.251
- Welcome.

31:25.251 --> 31:26.652
- Tyrell Chase.

31:26.652 --> 31:28.387
Visitors list includes
his mother, sister,

31:28.387 --> 31:30.422
and a guy listed
as his cousin,

31:30.422 --> 31:34.026
a Kris Dunning.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.294
- He was at Midway.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.629
- Okay, so he did three years
for aggravated assault.

31:37.629 --> 31:39.531
He skipped out on parole
and went off--

31:39.531 --> 31:42.101
- Mouse, do a deed search,
see if he owns any property.

31:42.101 --> 31:45.404
- Gotcha.
Kris Dunning deed search.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.772
Nothing.

31:53.179 --> 31:55.547
- We held up our end.

31:57.116 --> 31:58.817
- Go get him.

32:00.319 --> 32:03.422
[sniffing]

32:05.757 --> 32:07.259
Sure you don't want
to do a little bit bump,

32:07.259 --> 32:08.760
put you in a better mood?

32:08.760 --> 32:11.363
- I'm good.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.034
- [grunts]

32:15.034 --> 32:17.603
- Jay.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.637
It's okay.

32:18.637 --> 32:21.207
- Erin.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.209
- All right, come on,
we're getting out of here.

32:23.209 --> 32:24.210
- Hold up.

32:24.210 --> 32:25.377
Ain't no way

32:25.377 --> 32:27.046
either one of you
is walking out of here,

32:27.046 --> 32:29.248
not until these files check out.

32:35.654 --> 32:36.755
- You got his mother's name?

32:36.755 --> 32:38.324
Cross-reference it
with his mother's name.

32:38.324 --> 32:42.928
- Okay, Kris Dunning,
his mother is Jill Dunning.

32:42.928 --> 32:44.296
All right, Jill Dunning.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.499
Says here she owns
a '96 four-door beige compact.

32:47.499 --> 32:48.567
She had a house Englewood

32:48.567 --> 32:50.036
foreclosed on
a couple years back.

32:50.036 --> 32:51.537
Hold on.

32:51.537 --> 32:53.405
She bought a house
in Hyde Park

32:53.405 --> 32:55.307
for over $2 million
less than a year ago.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.709
It sounds a little
rags-to-riches, don't it?

32:57.709 --> 32:59.778
- Text me the address.

32:59.778 --> 33:01.747
- I got you now.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.049
- I just got to ask,

33:03.049 --> 33:05.484
how did you think
this was gonna play out?

33:05.484 --> 33:07.219
You kidnap
a Chicago police officer?

33:07.219 --> 33:09.721
It just doesn't seem
like a smart business move.

33:09.721 --> 33:14.626
- I got what I asked for,
didn't I?

33:14.626 --> 33:16.595
And what do you know
about my business?

33:20.066 --> 33:21.433
- I know that if you're worried

33:21.433 --> 33:23.269
about a rat
in your organization,

33:23.269 --> 33:25.471
it's already too late.

33:25.471 --> 33:26.772
- Derek.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.174
You're not gonna like this.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.308
- What?

33:29.308 --> 33:31.143
- Been through a dozen
of these so far.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.745
Not finding much that lines up.

33:33.745 --> 33:36.982
This guy, he's doing time
in Michigan,

33:36.982 --> 33:40.252
but his photo
doesn't match his name.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.287
This one,

33:41.287 --> 33:44.390
he's on parole
in Indiana for a DUI,

33:44.390 --> 33:46.758
when the report says
he's supposed to be

33:46.758 --> 33:48.694
some heavy hitter
with the cartels.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.961
- So what, you thought
you could bring me

33:49.961 --> 33:52.264
a box full of lies?

33:52.264 --> 33:53.799
- Look, I brought
the box that they gave me.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.534
If you want, I'll make a call.

33:59.505 --> 34:01.607
- I'm done making calls.

34:13.219 --> 34:13.351
.

34:14.719 --> 34:15.420
- All right,
it's two blocks over.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.724
[engines revving]

34:18.724 --> 34:20.726
- Hey, come here.

34:20.726 --> 34:22.761
- [groaning]
- All right, okay!

- [grunting]

- Don't shoot!

35:16.215 --> 35:17.249
Don't move.

35:17.249 --> 35:19.451
You're under arrest.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.519

35:55.221 --> 35:56.688
- Yeah.

[police radio chatter]

36:30.489 --> 36:32.057
You okay?

36:38.163 --> 36:40.699
- I'm just glad it was you
that they sent in.

36:52.311 --> 36:54.145
- I got to go wash this off.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.670
- Hey.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.541
I'm Alvin.

- Hey, um...

37:24.910 --> 37:26.378
- Dad.

37:26.378 --> 37:28.314
- Hey. Come here.

37:28.314 --> 37:29.915
- Um...

37:31.983 --> 37:34.920
- Uh, look,
your mom's not gonna be--

37:34.920 --> 37:36.322
she's gonna be
out of town for a while.

37:36.322 --> 37:38.056
- Yeah, I know.

37:38.056 --> 37:42.561
Vacationing at a facility
downstate for four to six.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.897
- Yeah, so I got a place
lined up for you to stay at.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.969
- I'm--I'm good
with all that.

37:53.204 --> 37:56.508
But I do need 80 bucks.

37:56.508 --> 37:58.910
- 80 b--

37:58.910 --> 38:00.111
All right.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.050
[horn honks]

38:05.050 --> 38:06.918
- Michelle!

38:08.420 --> 38:12.123

38:12.123 --> 38:13.492
40.

38:16.928 --> 38:19.465
[gentle music]

38:19.465 --> 38:22.601
- Hey, uh...

38:22.601 --> 38:26.372
I appreciate
you getting me out.

38:26.372 --> 38:28.374
I'll see you around.

38:50.496 --> 38:52.764
- Here, sign this.

38:52.764 --> 38:53.999
It's your statement
from the scene.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.702
I got to kick it up
to Fischer.

38:56.702 --> 38:59.237
That you acted
in self-defense.

38:59.237 --> 39:01.172
- I did what I had to do
to get Jay back.

39:01.172 --> 39:02.408
- I know.

39:18.590 --> 39:19.991
- Um...

39:22.461 --> 39:26.297
Hank, I think I'd like
to hang on to this.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.302
Listen, I'm sorry
if it took Jay being taken

39:31.302 --> 39:33.138
for me to realize
how much this means to me, but--

39:33.138 --> 39:34.205
- Listen, Erin.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.574
You want to hold on
to your badge,

39:35.574 --> 39:37.876
there's conditions.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.445
For starters,
you're gonna live with me

39:39.445 --> 39:41.613
and take weekly drug tests.

39:41.613 --> 39:42.614
- I can do that.

39:42.614 --> 39:43.982
- And there's one more thing.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.818
- What's that?

39:46.818 --> 39:49.488
- I want you to sever
all ties with your mother.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.959
Bunny is the cancer
in your life,

39:53.959 --> 39:55.927
and we both know it.

40:03.802 --> 40:05.904
Take it or leave it.

40:15.380 --> 40:16.381
- How you doing, doc?

40:16.381 --> 40:17.783
Got you a shot
and a beer.

40:17.783 --> 40:19.551
- Oh, too kind.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.419
- Thanks, Otis.
- You got it.

40:21.419 --> 40:25.223
- Hey, so...
Jay's gonna be all right?

40:25.223 --> 40:27.459
- Guys, don't worry.
Jay's gonna be fine.

40:27.459 --> 40:29.027
He'll be discharged
from Chicago Med tomorrow

40:29.027 --> 40:31.162
on medical leave, yeah.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.998
- I tell you,
what Jay went through,

40:32.998 --> 40:34.900
it's a hell of a way
to get a week off.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.301
[both chuckle]

40:36.301 --> 40:38.737
- He knew it.
He knew what he was doing.

40:38.737 --> 40:40.405
- Hey.
All right, to Halstead.

40:40.405 --> 40:41.840
- Mm.
- To Halstead.

40:41.840 --> 40:43.709
all: Halstead.

40:46.311 --> 40:48.346
- Get a couple more?
- Sure.

40:50.516 --> 40:53.084
- Listen, what I said to you

40:53.084 --> 40:55.587
about you and Adam
getting hitched,

40:55.587 --> 40:58.289
it was none of my business.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.559
- No, I get it.

41:00.559 --> 41:01.827
You know,
you're looking out for me.

41:01.827 --> 41:03.929
I appreciate that.

41:03.929 --> 41:04.930
But...

41:04.930 --> 41:06.632
[laughter]

41:06.632 --> 41:11.369
I mean, no risk,
no reward, right?

41:11.369 --> 41:13.772
- Right.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.440
I got to go see a man
about a dog.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.276
- [laughs]

41:18.276 --> 41:19.845
- Hey.
- Otis.

41:19.845 --> 41:21.813
- Heard somebody
got engaged?

41:21.813 --> 41:23.849
- Yeah, whoomp,
there it is.

41:23.849 --> 41:26.117
Ah!
- Oh-ho-ho.

41:26.117 --> 41:28.086
- Yeah, Adam was so romantic.

41:28.086 --> 41:29.588
He proposed
in the locker room.

41:29.588 --> 41:30.756
- Oh, nice.

41:30.756 --> 41:31.890
Oop.

41:31.890 --> 41:33.191
- Oh.
- Sorry.

41:33.191 --> 41:34.359
- It's okay.
Roman won't mind.

41:34.359 --> 41:35.727
- Hey, you know...
- Yeah.

41:35.727 --> 41:38.564
- Simple is good, because
last month I went on a call

41:38.564 --> 41:40.198
where a guy tried
to propose to his girl

41:40.198 --> 41:42.167
by parachuting
into her backyard,

41:42.167 --> 41:44.736
but he hit some power lines
on the way down,

41:44.736 --> 41:48.039
so let's say...

41:48.039 --> 41:50.776
there was never
a honeymoon.

41:50.776 --> 41:52.911
Anyway, congratulations.

41:52.911 --> 41:55.581
- Thanks.
Thanks, Otis.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.588
- Let's party.
- Okay.

42:02.588 --> 42:03.689
- Indeed, indeed.

42:03.689 --> 42:05.090
You kids look like
you need some shots.

42:05.090 --> 42:06.091
Baby.

42:06.091 --> 42:07.425
- Thanks.
- There you go.

42:07.425 --> 42:09.160
- Hey, to partners.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.229
- To partners.
both: To partners.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.466
- Whew!

42:54.740 --> 42:57.743
