- What's very good about it?
- Eight pounds and four shillings.

39:25.880 --> 39:29.839
- Ooh, that's not very good, is it?
- Borderline mediocre, if you ask me.

39:29.920 --> 39:32.912

- Yeah.

- Sounds sexy. Thanks, John.

53:55.240 --> 53:57.276

53:57.360 --> 53:59.191
Abracadabra eh, John?

54:05.160 --> 54:07.469
<i>(people chatter)</i>

54:09.560 --> 54:11.710
<i>(woman)</i> Gorgeous, isn't he?

54:15.560 --> 54:20.111
<i>(Julia)</i> I need to calm down now.
I'm embarrassing myself.

54:20.600 --> 54:22.795
- That was brilliant.
- Wasn't bad, was it?

54:22.880 --> 54:23.915
It was so good.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.798
We need to celebrate... everything.

54:33.720 --> 54:38.350
It's John's birthday soon so let's have
a party, at mine, Saturday. OK?

54:38.440 --> 54:41.796
- Can we get boozed up?
- Only if I can.

54:41.880 --> 54:45.998
- What about birds, Mrs Lennon?
- Let's just keep them in their cages.

54:47.600 --> 54:49.795
What do you reckon then, Johnny boy?

54:50.240 --> 54:54.518
- I think... I need a piss.
- <i>(boys laugh)</i>

55:02.240 --> 55:04.231
Who has got a light for a lady?

55:06.160 --> 55:08.151
<i>(toilet flushes)</i>

55:09.160 --> 55:11.151
Have you got a ticket?

55:12.800 --> 55:16.429
If you don't want her hanging
around the band, do something about it.

55:21.600 --> 55:23.397
It's my fucking band.

55:28.440 --> 55:30.590
John, the driver's not stopping.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.999
Thanks for that. Give us a ciggie.

55:37.960 --> 55:40.918
<i>(classical music plays softly)</i>

55:44.800 --> 55:47.678
Excuse me. That's very cosy.

55:53.440 --> 55:55.431
<i>(door shuts)</i>

56:00.600 --> 56:03.353
<i>(Pete)</i>
He said it's the police or the navy.

56:03.440 --> 56:05.749
My old man's giving me no other choice.

56:08.600 --> 56:12.195
Imagine me in a copper's uniform,
nicking people.

56:13.600 --> 56:15.591
Nicking you.

56:20.200 --> 56:22.395
I sometimes wish I had tits, you know?

56:23.560 --> 56:27.075
Not in a weird way,
just to have a little mess around with.

56:31.200 --> 56:33.316
- Hey, Winston?
- What?

56:33.400 --> 56:35.277
- This party.
- Yeah.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.952
We don't have to go.

56:37.840 --> 56:40.638
# <i>You ain't nothing but a hound dog</i>

56:42.000 --> 56:43.991
# <i>Been snooping round my door</i>

56:45.080 --> 56:47.674
# <i>You ain't nothing but a hound dog</i>

- <i>(boy)</i> Alright, John?

56:54.440 --> 56:56.908
# <i>But I ain't gonna feed you no more</i>

56:57.000 --> 56:58.991
Hi, John. How's it going, mate?

57:00.000 --> 57:02.673
<i>(Paul)</i> # <i>Love me true</i>

57:02.760 --> 57:06.639
# <i>All my dreams fulfil</i>

# <i>For my darling, I love you</i>

57:15.800 --> 57:20.999
# <i>And I always will</i>

57:22.640 --> 57:24.995
That was for her, wasn't it? Your mum.

57:26.880 --> 57:31.032
It was awful. Taken away from you...
It's not fair.

57:32.200 --> 57:34.350
She had cancer.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.792
What's your excuse?

57:46.040 --> 57:48.076
Nice.

57:48.160 --> 57:51.391
# <i>You wag your tail</i>

Can someone turn that bloody record off
before I start crying... in pain?

58:32.040 --> 58:34.759
- <i>(all laugh)</i>
- <i>(boy)</i> Give us a few words, Johnny boy.

58:34.840 --> 58:38.310
Cock, balls, fuck.

58:38.400 --> 58:41.597
- <i>(John)</i> Is that allowed?
- <i>(all)</i> Speech! Speech!

58:42.520 --> 58:45.796
<i>(John)</i> Well, ta, for turning up.
You're very special to me...

58:45.880 --> 58:48.952
<i>(posh accent)</i>
...in that I hate you all equally.

58:49.040 --> 58:54.319
- <i>(all laugh)</i>
- Apart from you, Mum, obviously.

58:54.400 --> 58:56.391
Thanks for all this.

58:56.480 --> 58:58.835
Well, big clap, folks,
you know, for Julia.

58:58.920 --> 59:00.353
<i>(all cheer)</i>

59:01.840 --> 59:04.229
And my band. What can I say?

59:05.160 --> 59:09.278
You really are there for me. Never
on time, usually looking like shite,

59:09.360 --> 59:11.920
but, nevertheless,
you're there or thereabouts.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.831
Speak for yourself, eh, Lennon!

59:13.920 --> 59:17.310
- So, where are we going, boys?
- To the toppity top, Johnny.

59:17.400 --> 59:21.188
That's right. <i>(posh accent)</i>
To the toppity of one's topness.

59:21.280 --> 59:23.953
- Except the boy Shotton wants out.
- <i>(all groan)</i>

59:24.040 --> 59:27.635
I know. Apparently, washboard players
don't get enough chicks

59:27.720 --> 59:31.508
and he feels like a pansy
in his mum's sewing thimbles.

59:31.600 --> 59:34.353
- Come here, spunkhead.
- Ow!

59:34.440 --> 59:35.475
Ooh!

59:36.680 --> 59:38.636
Worth a few bob when we're famous.

59:38.720 --> 59:40.517
He's alright.

- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a ciggie.

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:02.278
Have one here.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:21.591
I wonder if someone's up there on Mars,
having a quick cigarette like me.

01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:23.079
Where's Dad?

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:27.670
They're called dads, right?
Most people I know have got one.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.355
- I don't think...
- Oh, don't you, Mum? Well, I do.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:34.829
Think, think, think. That's all I do.

01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:40.793
Where's Daddy, Mummy?
Alf, that's his name, right?

01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:46.793
- Where's fucking Alf?
- Please don't swear, John.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.552
Make you feel uncomfortable?

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:52.428
Try being me for 17 years when everyone
asks why your auntie is your mum.

01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.795
Now, that's uncomfortable.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:00.509
Oh, here we go.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.473
Who turned the taps on?

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.076
- Please don't be horrible to me, John.
- Oh! Me being horrible to you?

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:12.948
Oh, I see. Horrible John,
naughty John, poor Julia.

01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:16.919
No, no. No walking away. I know
you're good at it, but not tonight.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.195
- Where is he?
- Oh!

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:26.155
- New Zealand, maybe. I don't know.
- Not round the corner, like you?

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:30.395
He was in the merchant navy.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.314
No letters, no money. He abandoned us.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.277
Then you abandoned me!

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.079
It was a temporary thing. Mimi agreed.

01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:41.515
Temporary? I'm still living with her.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.388
- I always wanted you back.
- Oh, I believe you. Honest.

01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:47.948
She never gave you back.

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.237
But surely I'm not Mimi's to give.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.197
You're my mum.

01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.753
She... She loves you so much.

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:02.397
Yeah, more than you.

01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.676
<i>(girl)</i> Mummy? I'm tired now.

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:13.358
- Are you sad again?
- Mummy's not sad. Look.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.795
I'm coming in now, honey.

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:18.472
Go on.

01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:26.318
I do love you. Believe me.

01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.073
Believe me, I would love to.

01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.555
- John, where are you going?
- Away from you.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.034
- <i>(door shuts)</i>
- <i>(John)</i> Mimi.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.991
You said you'd be back.

01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:28.071
I think I'll just...
I've got some work to finish.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.470
It was meant to be a surprise.

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.029
A Hoffner!

01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:46.553
Mimi.

01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.909
Ooh, you stink of alcohol.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.195
Mum threw a party for me.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:55.792
Oh.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.995
That's a waste, isn't it?

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:06.394
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:09.358
<i>(Mimi)</i>
Tell your friends the party's over.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:19.191
No, thanks.

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:23.394
- We've got a gatecrasher.
- I need to talk to John.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.471
Oh, more talking? Wow!

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.358
You see, me and Mum
have had a bit of a heart-to-heart.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.353
Yes, she told me things about...
Oh, what's his name...? Alf.

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.716
Oh, and about you, funnily enough.
Yeah, she said you stole me.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.792
- What do you reckon, Mimi?
- I never said that.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.270
You said, quote, "She," as in you,
Mimi, "never gave you back."

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.955
When I don't give things back,
I've got to admit, I'm usually stealing.

01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:48.918
What on earth have you
been telling him, Julia?

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.195
Did she say why I stole you?

01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.669
Well, there she is. Ask her yourself.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.116
Did she mention having another man's
child to deal with? A daughter?

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.394
Mimi, please.

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.075
<i>(Mimi)</i> Please what? Stop? Look at him.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.673
Do you think we can stop now?

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.192
Whose child?

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.549
<i>(Mimi)</i> Go on, tell him, as you're
so keen for him to know the truth.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.356
What daughter?

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:27.072
Your mother has always needed company.
Do you understand what I mean?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.911
Rock'n'roll, eh, Mum?

01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:38.237
And she found it, with a young soldier
whilst your father was away at sea.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.675
You have another sister. Victoria.

01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.597
Where is she? Where?

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:50.275
We don't know. Salvation Army took her.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.992
<i>(sobs)</i>

01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:57.877
<i>(Mimi)</i> Then, after that,

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.238
your mother decides to shack up
with another fancy man, Bobby.

01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:05.515
Still married to your father,
I might add,

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:09.036
and then bring you up as if that was
acceptable, as if that was normal.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:12.235
When your father came home
after the war,

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:16.108
he wanted to try and save the marriage,
but she'd have none of it.

01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:18.191
She told him to get lost.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.033
But Alf wasn't giving up that easily.
Was he, Julia?

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.510
Hmm? Oh, feel free
to join the conversation.

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.391
No, I didn't think she would.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:38.597
You were staying here with me
at Mendips

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:40.875
when Alf turned up out of the blue.

01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:44.789
He said he wanted to take you
into Liverpool.

01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:48.714
I thought he was genuine but he took you
to Blackpool instead. He kidnapped you.

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.553
Turned out he'd organised
a passage to New Zealand.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:55.030
Got himself a job out there.
Wanted to take you with him.

01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.958
We hadn't a clue where you were.
I was distraught!

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:02.677
The Seaman's Mission had an address
for a relative in Blackpool

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.796
so we went to find you,
to bring you back.

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:12.159
<i>(Mimi) Alf wouldn't let me in. Said</i>
<i>it was between him and your mother.</i>

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:15.118
<i>He pleaded with her</i>
<i>to give the marriage another chance,</i>

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:19.159
<i>to keep the family together,</i>
<i>but, again, it was of no use.</i>

01:07:22.480 --> 01:07:24.755
But what to do with you?

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:27.277
So, in all their great wisdom...

01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:30.238
Who do you want to be with,
me or your mum?

01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.273
<i>(Mimi)</i>... they decided to ask you,
a five-year-old boy,

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:38.158
who you wanted to spend
the rest of your life with.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.708
And you said...

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:42.755
My daddy.

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:45.039
Daddy.

01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:58.510
<i>(Mimi) So knowing that Alf was planning</i>
<i>to take you to New Zealand</i>

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:01.273
<i>and knowing she</i>
<i>would probably never see you again,</i>

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.793
your mother walked out.

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:09.113
Mum! Please! Stop.

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:13.278
<i>(Mimi) And that is when I stole you!</i>

01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:17.189
And if that's stealing, I'm a thief!

01:08:19.279 --> 01:08:21.270
I had no choice!

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:24.876
Oh, you had a choice.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.828
You chose to take my son.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.109
Oh, John,
I was never going to leave you.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.192
You walked out the fucking house,
down the street!

01:08:34.279 --> 01:08:36.555
Yes, yes, I did, but I was ill.

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:38.948
- I get ill.
- You left because you were ill?

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.429
I don't think straight. I don't sleep.

01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:44.033
I've seen doctors
but they don't understand.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.917
I don't understand.
But I am here now.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.354
I am here. I never meant to leave you.

01:08:49.439 --> 01:08:53.433
Please, John, please. I love you, John.
I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.475
- No... No!
- Please, John.

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:56.959
I said no!

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:04.118
Can't you see what you're doing to me?

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.398
I'm going out of my brain
and that's not fair!

01:09:11.279 --> 01:09:12.917
Is it?

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:17.675
This is your fault and yours.

01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.871
So, why should I go mad?

01:09:24.040 --> 01:09:25.598
Fuck it, it's over!

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:54.198
Go home, Julia.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.598
No chance. Get to fuck.

- <i>(gasps)</i> Oh!

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.073
- You frightened me to death.
- Right place for it.

01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:59.397
Did you?

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.869
Well, that's a horrible thing to say.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:05.157
- You never showed it.
- <i>(Mimi)</i> You just didn't see it.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.630
With my eyesight, possibly.

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:16.591
I'm not going to hold it against her,
what she did in Blackpool.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.478
- Forgive and forget, I suppose.
- <i>(John)</i> Forget?

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.633
I wish.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.474
There's just no point
hating someone you love.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:29.791
I mean, really love. Is there, Mimi?

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:41.434
- I should move out.
- <i>(Mimi)</i> What?

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:43.988
The house seems a bit crowded
all of a sudden.

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:46.914
Who knows, with me gone,

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.549
maybe you and Mum might remember
you were sisters once.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.589
- Have you ordered?
- Yes, tea.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.313
It's good to see you.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.995
- Here you are.
- Oh, lovely. Do you have any Earl Grey?

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.868
You're confusing us with Buckingham
Palace, love. It's easily done.

01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:03.592
I am not here to say I was wrong, Julia.
Not about John.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:05.671
I want that to be perfectly clear.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.599
But...

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.595
Perhaps I haven't always been right.

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.074
I do love you.

01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:33.156
I hope you know that.

<i>(John)</i> Do you own a licence
for those legs, ladies?

It's a nice day for it, then.

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.753
Everything feels so different
in the sunshine.

01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:48.229
Yes, usually warmer.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.392
How was college?

01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.597
A woman came in, took her kit off
and we painted her breasts.

01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:55.989
- Not actually physically.
- <i>(laughs)</i>

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:00.160
I've got my eye on you two.

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.313
<i>(Mimi)</i> Where are you going?

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.675
<i>(John)</i> Paul's waiting for me at his.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.149
- What about dinner?
- <i>(John)</i> I'm not hungry.

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:13.232
- Well, you will be.
- He could have his dinner at my house.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:16.312
Just with him being near,
you know, at Paul's.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.597
I mean, if you're not making
anything special, Mimi.

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:22.672

Tell him I've got a new booking.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.359
- The Stanley Abattoir Social Club.
- Oh, not there.
