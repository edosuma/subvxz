WEBVTT

00:02.203 --> 00:05.306
I have good news
for the women of Los Angeles.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.474
Dr. Will Stokes...

00:06.507 --> 00:08.409
back on the market.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.146
I thought I heard rain.

00:12.180 --> 00:15.416
But it must've been the sound
of panties dropping.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.085
It's been four months
to the day

00:17.118 --> 00:18.319
since I signed
my divorce papers,

00:18.352 --> 00:20.088
and I have decided

00:20.121 --> 00:21.989
to dive back in.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.324
Awesome!
Good for you.
Congratulations.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.425
I feel like I've aged

00:24.458 --> 00:25.493
in my oak barrel long enough.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.594
I think it's time to uncork

00:26.627 --> 00:28.396
this bottle of Will.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.431
"Bottle of Will." Uh-huh.

00:30.464 --> 00:33.601
When was the last time you asked
a woman out on a date?

00:33.634 --> 00:35.903
Uh, 1998.

00:35.936 --> 00:38.739
Okay, well,
I don't foresee any problems.

00:38.772 --> 00:42.009
Actually, Kate, we were quite
the dating duo in college.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.011
They used to call us
Pippen and Jordan.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.414
No, we were more like,
uh, Kobe and Shaq.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.449
Yeah, okay, I get it.
You were two overgrown men

00:48.482 --> 00:50.318
who liked to play
with your balls.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.587
Look, you're gonna
need some help,

00:53.621 --> 00:54.955
so we'll go to a bar together.

00:54.988 --> 00:56.124
I'll help you talk to girls.

00:56.157 --> 00:57.291
I don't need your help.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.127
You do, and lucky for you,

00:59.160 --> 01:00.294
I've got some free time.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.430
I'm gonna make you
my next project.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.198
Kate, I can meet women
on my own.

01:04.232 --> 01:06.066
I'm a 35-year-old single doctor.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.601
I mean,
women will-will come to me

01:07.635 --> 01:10.471
like moths to a... doctor.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.106
I think this ends
with you crying

01:12.140 --> 01:14.275
in the shower
while masturbating.

01:28.489 --> 01:31.091
Okay, pepperoni pizza
for everyone.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.326
All right.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.727
Except for Jules and Lowell,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.729
who get meat-free,
cheese-free,

01:35.763 --> 01:37.131
fun-free soy lover's pizza.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.799
Ah, thank you.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.635
Why don't you just eat the box?

01:41.669 --> 01:44.372
Well, I'm just gonna
grab a drink.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.042
Let me smell your meat.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.513
Jules, please.

01:52.546 --> 01:55.082
My wife is sitting
three feet away.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.320
That's me.

01:59.353 --> 02:01.422
Jules, why don't you
just have a slice?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.191
Because Lowell and I
are vegetarians.

02:03.224 --> 02:05.426
I just like the smell of meat.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.494
Oh, my God...

02:06.527 --> 02:07.595
You weren't a vegetarian

02:07.628 --> 02:08.862
before you met Lowell.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.097
You know, you always do this.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.199
Do what?

02:11.232 --> 02:13.033
Turn into your boyfriend.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.368
Oh, that is ridiculous.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.036
Name one time that I did that.

02:16.069 --> 02:19.373
Uh, when you dated that Canadian
and started saying "aboot."

02:20.741 --> 02:21.875
Or when you dated
the British guy

02:21.909 --> 02:23.577
and you started
a soccer riot.
Uh-huh.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.380
Or when you dated that pothead
and all you did

02:26.414 --> 02:29.783
was eat Hot Pockets
and not follow conversations.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.786
Okay, so-so I'm open
to learning new things.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.456
Lowell is turning me on
to a healthier lifestyle

02:35.489 --> 02:38.025
and I like that.
Babe, look,

02:38.058 --> 02:41.128
kombucha for two.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.197
What exactly is kombucha?

02:43.231 --> 02:45.799
Uh, it's just a tea made
with a symbiotic culture

02:45.833 --> 02:50.604
of bacteria and yeast that grows
a delicious drinkable fungus.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.575
Oh, my God, it started.
I can smell everything.

02:54.608 --> 02:55.876
That pizza smells gross.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.379
That diarrhea
you're drinking smells gross.

02:58.412 --> 03:00.147
And, Bobby,

03:00.180 --> 03:02.816
you smell really, really gross.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.084
No, he doesn't.

03:04.117 --> 03:05.886
He smells like cinnamon.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.588
Oh, boy. It's back.

03:07.621 --> 03:08.656
What's back?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.190
The Super Smell phase.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.925
Her pregnancy hormones
have kicked in.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.761
Now she can
smell everything.

03:13.794 --> 03:17.130
Which one of you dudes went
to a strip club today?

03:24.472 --> 03:26.640
I like looking at dongs.

03:38.486 --> 03:41.121
I see you're checking out
the Uniekaas Robusto.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.790
What?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.625
It's an aged goat cheese
with a nutty flavor.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.594
Pairs nicely with a Pinot Noir.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.296
Do you work here?

03:48.329 --> 03:50.664
No, I'm just a lover of cheese.

03:51.965 --> 03:53.301
And women.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.935
Can I start over?

03:57.338 --> 03:58.639
Hi.
Hi.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.541
Allow me to begin by saying
I'm a fellow shopper

04:00.574 --> 04:02.109
and a bit of a foodie.

04:02.142 --> 04:04.111
Might I recommend
the Chabichou?

04:04.144 --> 04:05.813
It's a creamy
natural-rind cheese

04:05.846 --> 04:07.981
that pairs beautifully
with a Chenin Blanc.

04:08.015 --> 04:09.950
Why are you telling me this?

04:09.983 --> 04:11.985
I'm a doctor.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.822
Why are you telling me this,
Doctor?

04:14.855 --> 04:18.025
Why is it so hard
to meet people?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.495
Hi, I'm a wealthy doctor.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.596
Well, not-not wealthy.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.164
I mean, comfortable.

04:24.197 --> 04:27.134
Yeah. My wife left me so I'm-I'm
staying with some friends,

04:27.167 --> 04:28.802
which is really
what I need right now.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.504
You know, I'm...
I'm healing.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.306
Bottom line, I am

04:32.340 --> 04:34.675
looking to meet a nice girl
in the cheese section.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.010
Sometimes I talk too
much when I'm nervous.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.178
Like now.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.348
And now.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.816
And just then.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.524
So I said to my assistant, if
you're gonna have a C-section,

04:50.558 --> 04:53.293
have it on the weekend,
you know what I mean?

04:53.327 --> 04:55.496
Thank you.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.331
You, uh... you want a bite?

04:57.365 --> 04:58.666
I won't tell anyone.

04:58.699 --> 05:00.501
I really shouldn't.

05:00.534 --> 05:02.503
Maybe just a little one.
Yeah.

05:02.536 --> 05:04.772
Just...

05:04.805 --> 05:05.873
Yeah.

05:11.579 --> 05:14.515
That is so freakin' good.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.049
Mm-hmm.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.586
Well, you can have
another bite if you w... Oh.
Mmm.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.918
I think that burger
might be enjoying this

05:50.951 --> 05:52.252
as much as you are.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.893
Maybe more.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.703
Anybody want to order food
from Poquito Mas?

06:09.737 --> 06:11.605
Hey, uh, my restaurant's
still open.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.843
Anybody want to order food
from Poquito Mas?

06:15.876 --> 06:18.412
I'm not hungry because
I ate a big giant salad.

06:18.446 --> 06:20.781
Sunflower seeds
and garbanzo beans

06:20.814 --> 06:22.616
and super yummy
alfalfa sprouts...

06:22.650 --> 06:25.285
You're overcorrecting.
Shut it down.

06:25.318 --> 06:26.454
I'm good.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.590
So, uh, Kate,

06:29.623 --> 06:31.525
I was thinking
maybe you and I could, uh,

06:31.559 --> 06:32.860
go to a bar this weekend.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.528
You know, just for fun.

06:34.562 --> 06:36.163
Hmm. Interesting.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.366
What?

06:39.399 --> 06:41.769
I thought Dr. Stokes
had it covered.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.971
Thought he was gonna
uncork himself

06:44.004 --> 06:46.039
all over the ladies
of Los Angeles.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.709
That is all... in process.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.911
I just thought, in the meantime,
it would be fun to hang

06:50.944 --> 06:52.312
with one of my closest friends.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.314
And, yet, what I'm hearing is,

06:54.347 --> 06:56.316
"Please, please, please help me.

06:56.349 --> 06:58.285
I'm a loser."

06:58.318 --> 07:00.821
All right, look, maybe I could
use a wingman, all right?

07:00.854 --> 07:04.324
I mean, Red here used to be my
wingman but he's out of the game

07:04.357 --> 07:07.327
and even when he was in the
game, he didn't have much game.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.996
What are you talking about?

07:09.029 --> 07:11.465
I used to do my magic tricks
for chicks at bars.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.600
They loved it.

07:12.633 --> 07:13.801
What's that
behind your ear?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.103
Oh, it's my phone number.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.140
Wow.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.309
And you're married.

07:22.342 --> 07:23.644
Okay, you know what?

07:23.677 --> 07:26.847
Congratulations-- you're
officially my project.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.016
Never wear that shirt again.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.819
This shirt is very this season.

07:31.852 --> 07:34.522
You look like the end
of a roll of Scotch Tape.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.160
Okay, I smell bacon.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.829
And not just bacon

07:41.862 --> 07:43.831
but a bacon cheeseburger,

07:43.864 --> 07:45.065
possibly a double.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.435
Ugh! Which one of you

07:48.468 --> 07:50.671
had a big, gross
bacon cheeseburger?

07:52.405 --> 07:54.041
Okay, one of you did.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.581
Oh, no. I was wrong.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.085
No burger here.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.389
It couldn't have been Jules.
Uh, she's a vegetarian.

08:09.422 --> 08:12.392
Right, Jules?

08:12.425 --> 08:13.827
Okay, it was me!

08:13.861 --> 08:15.395
I ate a burger.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.030
With bacon.

08:17.064 --> 08:18.699
And I loved it.

08:21.501 --> 08:24.738
All right, I don't want
to make a scene...

08:24.772 --> 08:28.075
but my world
has just been rocked.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.411
I am sorry.

08:31.444 --> 08:32.580
I love meat.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.715
I love it so freakin' hard.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.118
It's not that you ate the meat.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.154
It's that you lied.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.592
You're right. I'm really sorry.

08:44.625 --> 08:48.261
I receive that.

08:49.630 --> 08:51.565
Okay.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.834
From now on,
let's just be

08:53.867 --> 08:55.903
completely honest
with each other.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.237
Absolutely.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.606
Oh, it's our first fight.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.273
I know. It was touch and go
there for a while,

09:00.307 --> 09:02.976
but we made it
through, baby.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.113
Bobby.

09:06.146 --> 09:09.617
Bobby, come here.
What's up?

09:09.650 --> 09:12.786
I have entered a new phase.

09:12.820 --> 09:13.854
What is it?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.056
The Super Horny...

09:16.089 --> 09:18.859
"I Want You to Do Me
Right Now" phase.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.861
That is new.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.129
I like it.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.464
So, get rid of everyone,

09:24.497 --> 09:26.466
meet me upstairs,
I'll get started?

09:26.499 --> 09:27.968
Yeah, but how you gonna
get started with...

09:28.001 --> 09:29.102
Oh...

09:29.136 --> 09:30.771
Yes.

09:30.804 --> 09:32.205
Okay.

09:32.239 --> 09:33.607
Everyone get the hell out.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.275
Now.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.811
Let's go.

09:41.481 --> 09:44.317
Okay, a woman decides
if she wants to sleep with you

09:44.351 --> 09:45.819
in the first five seconds.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.655
Whatever you say in that first
moment clinches the deal.

09:47.688 --> 09:49.389
I'll lead, you follow.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.824
See her?

09:50.858 --> 09:52.860
Catch her beer.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.629
Oh, my gosh.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.631
Thanks.

09:57.665 --> 09:58.666
Thank you.

09:58.699 --> 09:59.667
For what?

09:59.700 --> 10:02.970
For...

10:03.003 --> 10:06.206
uh, being alone in a bar.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.177
Have you ever been married?
I've been married.

10:11.278 --> 10:14.014
Um, I'm gonna go find
my friends.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.315
I thought you were alone.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.650
I am.

10:18.886 --> 10:23.090
Wow. That was like watching
a gazelle eat a lion.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.825
Don't blame me, okay?
You freaked me out

10:24.858 --> 10:26.694
with the whole first
five seconds thing.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.528
Okay, okay, I'll start
the conversation this time.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.497
Let's try again with Fake Boobs

10:30.530 --> 10:32.499
over here, okay?
Hopefully,

10:32.532 --> 10:35.168
her low self-esteem
will cloud her judgment.

10:36.203 --> 10:37.871
Hey, love your shoes.

10:37.905 --> 10:39.106
Oh, thanks!

10:39.139 --> 10:40.440
This is my friend, Will.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.875
He's a doctor.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.711
Really? That's cool.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.478
It is cool.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.950
Uh, this one time in med school,
my, uh, my buddies and I--

10:49.983 --> 10:51.551
we took a liver from a cadaver,

10:51.584 --> 10:53.653
and we... and we threw it
off the roof.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.888
It was...

10:54.922 --> 10:56.890
That's disgusting.

10:58.759 --> 11:00.894
How can I be
so bad at this?

11:00.928 --> 11:02.896
Uh, well, you got
married young,

11:02.930 --> 11:04.732
you never really
dated as an adult,

11:04.765 --> 11:06.834
and I've seen your
high school yearbook.

11:06.867 --> 11:08.902
Nobody was
touching you then.

11:08.936 --> 11:10.804
Kate, I'm all up in my head!

11:10.838 --> 11:12.039
Okay, new strategy.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.807
You say as little
as possible,

11:13.841 --> 11:14.975
I'll get you laid.

11:15.008 --> 11:16.810
I like it.
That-that makes a lot of...

11:16.844 --> 11:18.812
Too much.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.751
Hi. I'm Kate.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.753
You're obviously
the hottest girl in here,

11:25.786 --> 11:28.255
and my friend Will
is pretty much the cutest guy,

11:28.288 --> 11:29.890
so I figured
I'd introduce you two.

11:29.923 --> 11:30.991
I'm Jess.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.026
Speak. Speak now.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.329
I am Will.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.431
I hail from...

11:38.465 --> 11:40.433
Three beers. Go.

11:41.802 --> 11:45.338
He's a man of few words,
but check out that ass.

11:45.372 --> 11:48.408
It's like those butt cheeks are
storing nuts for the winter.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.412
You didn't have
to sell me on him.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.281
I knew in the
first five seconds.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.515
I like you.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.017
You remind me of myself.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.952
Except you have
those amazing eyes.

11:58.986 --> 12:01.121
You suddenly seem
smarter to me.

12:02.823 --> 12:05.025
Okay, I'm going to go
to the ladies' room.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.994
Man... of... few... words.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.964
So...

12:10.998 --> 12:13.633
So...

12:13.666 --> 12:15.803
You're shy.

12:15.836 --> 12:18.872
Shy.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.573
That's sweet.

12:20.607 --> 12:23.010
And your friend's great,
stepping up for you like that.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.313
Friend.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.482
This might be the
tequila talking,

12:29.516 --> 12:31.518
but should we just
get out of here?

12:34.855 --> 12:37.124
Great. Get your friend.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.959
Uh... why?

12:38.992 --> 12:41.394
Because I'm into
both of you.

12:41.428 --> 12:42.830
Pardon?

12:42.863 --> 12:45.232
I want to have sex
with both of you.

12:48.001 --> 12:50.537
Yeah, I don't...
I don't think that's gonna...

12:55.542 --> 12:57.744
Okay, then, the three of us.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.379
Sounds good.
Sounds like a plan.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.024
Hi.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.259
Whoa. Oh, my God.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.861
How did you strike out again?

13:13.894 --> 13:15.362
I set you up perfectly.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.831
What, do I need to take
her clothes off for you, too?

13:17.865 --> 13:20.533
Uh, I didn't strike
out, actually.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.202
She wants me to
go home with her.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.537
Oh, great. Good-bye. Uncork.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.439
Uh, uh, no, no, not...

13:26.473 --> 13:28.541
not-not good-bye,
uh, because...

13:28.575 --> 13:30.443
because you drove me here.

13:30.477 --> 13:33.680
And we can't let Jess drive
because she's already had a few.

13:33.713 --> 13:36.783
And I'm pretty sure she
wants to have two more.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.186
Oh.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.621
Fine. I am such a good friend.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.423
It's like there's nothing
I won't do.

13:46.259 --> 13:48.261
That's what I'm hoping.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.138
Oh, my God.

13:58.171 --> 14:00.040
That was amazing.

14:00.073 --> 14:02.575
I feel like I could sleep
for 12 hours.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.344
What do you mean,
go to sleep?

14:04.377 --> 14:06.246
I want to do it again.

14:06.279 --> 14:09.082
But didn't you just
have a massive...?

14:09.116 --> 14:12.886
Yeah! Why would
I want to stop?

14:12.920 --> 14:14.354
Well, honey, it's just,

14:14.387 --> 14:17.925
it's been a couple of nights of
this marathon sex, and I, uh...

14:17.958 --> 14:21.328
I need a breather.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.363
Or an ice pack.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.734
You'll stop when I
tell you to stop.

14:32.605 --> 14:36.676
I know you're a man of
few words, but don't worry.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.812
Tonight, you won't be using
your mouth for talking.

14:40.981 --> 14:44.417
That makes me want
to raise my eyebrow like this.

14:45.986 --> 14:48.421
Thanks for letting me
use your bathroom.

14:48.455 --> 14:49.789
Stay.

14:49.822 --> 14:51.791
What? Why?

14:55.162 --> 14:58.131
Look, the truth is, on my own,
I struck out non-stop.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.133
Okay, clearly,
you're my good luck charm.

15:00.167 --> 15:01.468
My rabbit's foot.

15:01.501 --> 15:04.137
And I honestly think
for this to happen,

15:04.171 --> 15:06.506
we're gonna have
to rub your fur a little bit.

15:08.241 --> 15:09.977
Please?

15:10.010 --> 15:13.146
Well, I don't like leaving
projects unfinished.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.048
Great! I'm gonna
go get some wine.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.217
Hey.

15:17.250 --> 15:21.288
Hey. So, um, just so you know,
Will's a little nervous.

15:21.321 --> 15:22.889
So I hope you don't think
it's too forward,

15:22.922 --> 15:24.491
but I think
you should make the first move.

15:24.524 --> 15:25.959
My pleasure.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.028
Great. So, just
make it happen...

15:35.702 --> 15:38.571
Be right back.

15:38.605 --> 15:40.073
We have a problem.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.841
Turns out,
I am too good at this.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.011
She doesn't want you,
she wants me!

15:44.044 --> 15:45.845
She just kissed me!

15:45.878 --> 15:48.248
Yeah, about that.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.350
Uh, she's looking
for a two-fer.

15:50.383 --> 15:54.087
I don't...

15:54.121 --> 15:55.955
And you knew?!
That's the whole reason

15:55.989 --> 15:58.158
you got me
to come back here, isn't it?!

15:58.191 --> 16:00.860
Come on, Kate, I'm asking
you for one little favor.

16:00.893 --> 16:04.031
Remember the time I drove
you to the airport?

16:04.064 --> 16:07.167
How is this the same?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.169
It was rush hour.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.006
You can not seriously
expect me to do this.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.442
I'm just asking you to play
along for a little bit.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.378
A little ear nibbling, a little
under-the-shirt, over-the-bra.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.080
PG-13.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.350
And then, you go to the
bathroom or whatever,

16:23.383 --> 16:25.718
and then, 20 minutes, I'm done,
dressed and ready to go.

16:25.752 --> 16:28.555
What a lucky girl.

16:28.588 --> 16:31.124
Forget it.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.426
I've only ever
slept with Val!

16:34.827 --> 16:36.563
What?!

16:36.596 --> 16:40.633
I've only slept with one
person my entire life, okay?

16:40.667 --> 16:45.038
How is that even possible?

16:45.072 --> 16:47.040
We met when I was 19.

16:47.074 --> 16:49.876
Got engaged at 21, and got
divorced four months ago.

16:49.909 --> 16:52.745
Oh, my God, yes, this is all
starting to make sense.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.247
The-the lack of game,

16:54.281 --> 16:57.584
the pathetic blend
of awkwardness and urgency.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.087
You're an almost-virgin.

17:02.122 --> 17:04.091
I am.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.425
Okay, I am that.

17:05.458 --> 17:09.529
So, please, help Little Will
make a second friend.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.735
Fine. I'll do it.

17:15.768 --> 17:17.437
You will?!
I can't believe

17:17.470 --> 17:18.705
I'm saying this, but yes.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.107
It's an important step for you.

17:20.140 --> 17:22.775
And, you know, it can't be
any worse than that time

17:22.809 --> 17:24.944
I accidentally had sex
with my cousin.

17:24.977 --> 17:27.347
Awesome! That's the
attitude I'm looking for!

17:27.380 --> 17:29.082
But my clothes stay on.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.684
Also, I'm upstairs,
you're downstairs,

17:31.718 --> 17:34.121
and never the twain shall meet.

17:34.154 --> 17:36.756
She's not gonna be
focusing on you anyway.

17:36.789 --> 17:38.258
What? Why?

17:38.291 --> 17:39.426
'Cause, obviously,

17:39.459 --> 17:40.760
you're the appetizer,
I'm the entree.

17:40.793 --> 17:42.895
Okay.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.897
The appetizer.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.300
Oh...

17:47.334 --> 17:50.637
Oh, my God,
I'm having a real orgasm.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.140
Wow!

17:53.173 --> 17:55.642
Good night.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.944
You just faked an orgasm.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.980
What?
Yeah.

18:01.013 --> 18:03.283
Those are the sounds
of my passion.

18:03.316 --> 18:06.386
And I am hurt and offended
that you would mock them.

18:06.419 --> 18:08.121
I've been with
you for ten years.

18:08.155 --> 18:10.089
I've never once heard
you make that noise.

18:10.123 --> 18:12.325
What kind of a man
fakes an orgasm?

18:12.359 --> 18:14.594
A man who's tired.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.131
Who's been wrung dry.

18:19.332 --> 18:21.401
I just can't do it anymore.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.970
Oh. It's okay, I get it.

18:24.003 --> 18:28.408
I'm not, you know, that
appealing in my current state.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.177
What are you talking about?

18:30.210 --> 18:32.512
I understand why you wouldn't
want to have sex with me.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.581
I'm like a big,
giant pregnant woman.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.083
One of my boobs is
bigger than your head.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.986
Honey, you are
absolutely gorgeous.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.621
No, I'm not. I'm huge.

18:41.654 --> 18:44.291
I look like a sea lion
with lipstick.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.361
Andi, every time
you smile at me,

18:48.395 --> 18:51.498
I have to pinch myself
that you chose me.

18:51.531 --> 18:54.367
Really?
Yes.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.437
I just can't have sex
a million times in three days.

18:57.470 --> 19:00.307
I literally
have nothing left.

19:00.340 --> 19:04.211
I tried to cry in the middle,
and no tears came out.

19:06.313 --> 19:10.617
Do you want to maybe-- I don't
know-- cuddle or something?

19:10.650 --> 19:12.519
Nothing would make me happier.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.587
Okay.

19:22.229 --> 19:25.031
You know what? I'm gonna
go sit on the dryer.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.805
Excuse me.

19:32.839 --> 19:34.607
Excuse me.

19:35.608 --> 19:37.143
Can I ask you
a question?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.747
Which one of us were you
attracted to initially?

19:40.780 --> 19:43.483
Like, if we
were a meal,

19:43.516 --> 19:46.286
which one of us
would you eat first?

19:47.354 --> 19:49.522
I don't know.

19:49.556 --> 19:53.393
There is something about
the sensual softness of a woman.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.428
Oh. Okay.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.464
Ha, ha.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.935
Excuse me? Excuse me?

20:02.969 --> 20:05.071
Yeah, uh, softness
is-is one thing,

20:05.104 --> 20:06.739
but-but feel
these abs, huh?

20:06.773 --> 20:09.108
How'd you like
to crack open this six pack?

20:09.141 --> 20:11.611
I have great boobs.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.746
I have an ass
of steel.
I'm bendy.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.448
I will do some seriously
messed-up stuff.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.016
I have no
self-respect.

20:17.049 --> 20:19.786
I have the penis. Touchdown!

20:19.819 --> 20:21.788
Wow.

20:21.821 --> 20:25.358
The sexual tension
between you guys is amazing.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.960
I'd really like
to see you two kiss.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.799
Yeah, we're out.
That just ruined it.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.774
Okay.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.810
I've had 24 hours.

20:43.843 --> 20:46.313
I'm replenished, refreshed
and ready to go.

20:46.346 --> 20:48.247
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

20:48.281 --> 20:50.650
I've, uh... I've
entered a new...

20:53.152 --> 20:55.322
...phase.

20:55.355 --> 20:57.457
But the fact that
you still want me--

20:57.490 --> 21:00.026
it makes me feel very
good about myself.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.463
I love you.

21:03.496 --> 21:05.064
I'm gonna fart.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.467
Okay.

21:07.767 --> 21:11.270
