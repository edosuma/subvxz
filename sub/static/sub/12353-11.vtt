WEBVTT

00:05.411 --> 00:07.044
Stella McCartney
scoop-neck sweater

00:07.079 --> 00:09.111
and a nice pair
of wide-leg slacks.

00:09.231 --> 00:11.063
You know what would make it all
really fierce?

00:11.097 --> 00:12.631
Crocs.

00:12.665 --> 00:14.533
I'm just gonna come right out
and say it--

00:14.567 --> 00:16.938
the movie version of <i>Rent,</i>
way better than the play.

00:16.972 --> 00:18.206
Way better.

00:18.240 --> 00:19.173
Nicki Minaj

00:19.293 --> 00:21.239
strangles puppies.

00:21.359 --> 00:23.078
Now that's going too far.

00:23.198 --> 00:24.859
Too far.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.845
All right, you're not
going to talk to me,

00:27.965 --> 00:29.944
I'm not gonna talk to you.

00:29.979 --> 00:32.244
Two can play at that--
you have to talk to me!

00:32.280 --> 00:33.434
I'm your father!

00:33.554 --> 00:35.853
Look, I'm not happy about
how this whole April thing went down,

00:35.973 --> 00:37.099
but she's gone, all right?

00:37.219 --> 00:38.358
You gotta talk to me, Roscoe.

00:38.478 --> 00:39.782
You hear me?

00:46.509 --> 00:48.095
What?

00:53.283 --> 00:55.083
JEREMIAH: I think you're just
gonna have to back up

00:55.118 --> 00:57.119
and give Roscoe his space.

00:57.154 --> 00:58.354
Respect his silence.

00:58.389 --> 00:59.856
Respect his right to individuate.

00:59.891 --> 01:01.424
Oh, I think he's individuated.

01:01.458 --> 01:03.993
Hey, Grandpa, can you move
your doctor's appointment?

01:04.027 --> 01:06.761
I don't want him
picking me up from school today.

01:06.795 --> 01:08.463
(laughs)

01:08.497 --> 01:10.198
Oh, "him" is gonna pick you up
from school today.

01:10.233 --> 01:12.167
You can count on that.
Okay, okay.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.336
Roscoe, I think you need
to speak to your father.

01:14.370 --> 01:16.872
Let him know what
you're feeling, okay?

01:16.906 --> 01:18.673
That's the same thing Aaron said.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.508
If I talk to Dad, he's gonna
think everything's okay,

01:20.543 --> 01:21.510
and nothing will ever change.

01:21.544 --> 01:23.645
Who's Aaron?

01:26.549 --> 01:27.849
Fuck is Aaron?

01:27.883 --> 01:29.984
It's Monica's new friend.

01:30.018 --> 01:32.520
Oh, so Monica's new boy toy

01:32.554 --> 01:36.024
is giving my son parental advice now?

01:36.058 --> 01:37.058
That how that works?

01:37.093 --> 01:38.626
(phone chiming)

01:38.660 --> 01:41.496
You get that out of your
thought right now, son.

01:41.530 --> 01:44.065
Hey, what's up?

01:44.099 --> 01:46.100
Till when?

01:47.368 --> 01:48.735
Yeah. Shit.

01:51.205 --> 01:52.772
Fix it.
Yeah.

01:54.842 --> 01:57.176
"Total Eclipse of the Heart"...

01:57.210 --> 01:59.812
Ugh, Doug--
"Dust in the Wind"? No.

01:59.846 --> 02:00.979
Two tracks from Jackson Browne.

02:01.013 --> 02:02.847
You need to put two tracks on here.

02:02.881 --> 02:05.182
Yeah, I don't expect a layman
to get it, all right?

02:05.216 --> 02:09.384
Making a great mix CD requires
a level of guile and-and wit

02:09.419 --> 02:11.420
that you could not possibly
understand, okay?

02:11.455 --> 02:13.189
No, you could-- please
don't touch that.

02:13.223 --> 02:14.757
You have to make an order.

02:14.792 --> 02:16.659
You gotta find the right
balance of fast and slow.

02:16.693 --> 02:21.429
Bolting upright at 3:00 a.m.,
haunted by that one track

02:21.464 --> 02:23.531
you know did not fit
the unifying motif.

02:23.565 --> 02:25.399
Doug, you're fucking insane.

02:25.433 --> 02:26.666
I disagree.

02:26.701 --> 02:28.101
Now, let me tell you something.

02:28.135 --> 02:30.036
I happen to think that
earnest songs scare you.

02:30.070 --> 02:31.604
That's right. I think that
you're afraid to feel something.

02:31.639 --> 02:33.673
I think that I'm afraid of
listening to total crap.

02:33.708 --> 02:36.943
Clyde, you are an emotional infant.

02:36.977 --> 02:39.712
Doug, you have
horse-shit taste in music.

02:39.746 --> 02:41.447
Did you not hear?
What?

02:41.481 --> 02:42.948
The merger vote has been moved up.

02:42.982 --> 02:45.384
The partners are assembling
tonight at 7:00.

02:45.418 --> 02:46.585
Fuck.
Yeah.

02:46.619 --> 02:49.387
You know, people love my mix CDs.

02:49.421 --> 02:51.422
Doug, did you hear
what Jeannie just said?

02:51.456 --> 02:52.456
I did, yes.

02:52.491 --> 02:53.858
We are hours away from getting

02:53.892 --> 02:55.359
our professional assholes jackhammered

02:55.393 --> 02:58.095
by Metro Capital's Milton
Berle-size cock.

02:58.130 --> 02:59.897
Well, this is perfect timing, then.

02:59.931 --> 03:01.431
People say my mixes are
a great source of comfort

03:01.466 --> 03:02.899
in difficult times.

03:02.934 --> 03:04.234
You know, when I was
making my 9/11 mix--

03:04.268 --> 03:06.469
You made a 9/11 mix? So...

03:06.504 --> 03:09.273
Yeah, it's when I first
discovered my, uh, my gift.

03:09.307 --> 03:10.741
CLYDE: The terrorists
have truly won.

03:10.775 --> 03:12.543
You like, uh, Buddhism, right?

03:12.577 --> 03:15.312
I haven't given it much thought.

03:15.347 --> 03:16.747
Actually, I've studied
Buddhism for years.

03:16.782 --> 03:18.383
Really?

03:18.417 --> 03:20.952
Well, I, uh, recently discovered
the teachings of Buddha.

03:20.987 --> 03:23.322
Huge fan. Love that
little fat man.

03:23.356 --> 03:25.390
So there's this Buddhist
retreat up in Santa Cruz.

03:25.424 --> 03:27.458
Yoga, meditation, snacks--
hoping for raita--

03:27.493 --> 03:30.261
yogurt and cucumbers, yum!

03:30.296 --> 03:32.230
Is it an open invitation?
Oh, it's couples only.

03:32.265 --> 03:34.466
Well, you guys could--if you want--
We're not a couple.

03:34.500 --> 03:35.800
You know, I think I'm gonna pass.

03:35.835 --> 03:37.068
If this is about the merger,
you should know

03:37.102 --> 03:38.403
I feel bad about

03:38.437 --> 03:41.339
the small role I played in that.

03:41.374 --> 03:44.276
The small role you played, Greg,
was making the merger happen.

03:44.310 --> 03:46.279
Right there.
Right there. This.

03:46.313 --> 03:48.348
This is what makes us great.

03:48.382 --> 03:50.250
The back and forth,
the he said, she said.

03:50.284 --> 03:51.517
Boom-boom, boom-boom!
It's so, it's screwball.

03:51.552 --> 03:53.085
(chuckles)

03:53.120 --> 03:54.821
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee
from downstairs.

03:54.855 --> 03:56.757
Smart.
More banter.

03:56.791 --> 03:59.258
(chuckles)
I love this! It's great!

03:59.293 --> 04:02.829
Never say die, Marty, but as of
now, we do not have the votes.

04:02.863 --> 04:04.931
What about Millar and Calhoun?
Who?

04:04.965 --> 04:07.100
Eyebrows and ink stain.

04:07.134 --> 04:09.169
You want to take a run at those
ancient fucks, be my guest.

04:09.204 --> 04:11.438
If you can pry 'em away
from the Bingo table.

04:11.473 --> 04:15.175
They survived this long 'cause they
know which way the wind blows.

04:15.209 --> 04:17.812
The guy with the power is
pro-merger, they're pro-merger.

04:17.846 --> 04:21.382
And right now, Skip is the guy
with the power.

04:21.416 --> 04:22.818
And what the fuck is up
with your white knight?

04:22.852 --> 04:23.819
You know, when they moved up the vote,

04:23.853 --> 04:25.554
it threw Cazuelas as well.

04:25.589 --> 04:28.458
(phone chiming)
He's getting his ducks in a row.

04:31.596 --> 04:33.030
Hey, Roscoe.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.035
Roscoe...

04:40.606 --> 04:43.976
I know you're there;
I can hear you breathing.

04:44.010 --> 04:47.045
Yeah, okay, I'm hanging up now.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.248
Man, he picked the perfect time
to become a teenager.

04:49.282 --> 04:52.318
You ain't seen nothin' yet.

04:52.352 --> 04:54.987
You know, around Roscoe's age,

04:55.022 --> 04:59.559
my sweet daughter metamorphosed
into a she-beast.

04:59.593 --> 05:01.828
Ugh...
But the good news

05:01.863 --> 05:05.032
is it doesn't last--
four years, five, tops.

05:05.066 --> 05:07.234
Now she's Daddy's little girl again.

05:07.269 --> 05:09.770
Five years? That's all?
That's fantastic.

05:09.804 --> 05:11.171
They come around.

05:11.206 --> 05:12.840
It's incredible.

05:12.874 --> 05:14.442
Whatever happens here, today,

05:14.476 --> 05:15.776
just hang on to that.

05:17.000 --> 05:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:25.120 --> 05:27.488
You left this the other night.

05:32.828 --> 05:34.227
These aren't mine.

05:34.262 --> 05:35.696
I'm sure you have a lot of jewelry;

05:35.730 --> 05:36.864
maybe you just forgot.

05:36.898 --> 05:39.199
Can we just not, please?

05:39.233 --> 05:40.934
I wasn't operating
under the assumption

05:40.968 --> 05:42.135
that you weren't...

05:42.169 --> 05:43.803
Oh, that's good.

05:43.837 --> 05:45.638
Good.

05:45.672 --> 05:48.641
Not like you can stake out the
moral high ground, anyway.

05:48.675 --> 05:50.576
Nope.

05:51.912 --> 05:52.945
Hi, Greg.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.213
Rainman.

05:54.248 --> 05:56.549
Uh... maker.
Rainmaker.

05:56.584 --> 05:57.851
Uh, Marco.

06:00.088 --> 06:01.255
(sighs)

06:01.289 --> 06:03.591
(meditative hum)

06:06.996 --> 06:08.296
(buzzes, bell rings)

06:08.330 --> 06:09.631
(elevator whirrs, powers down)

06:09.665 --> 06:10.898
Seriously?

06:10.933 --> 06:12.433
I've hit rock bottom.

06:12.467 --> 06:13.935
I'm really sorry to hear that,
Greg, but...

06:13.969 --> 06:15.269
Funny thing is, you know,

06:15.304 --> 06:17.305
you spend your life
circling the bottom,

06:17.340 --> 06:19.174
fooling yourself that you're not
actually circling the bottom,

06:19.209 --> 06:20.576
clinging to those parts
of your existence

06:20.610 --> 06:22.511
you think you need to survive,

06:22.546 --> 06:24.513
but are, in fact, the very
reason you're circling...

06:24.548 --> 06:26.448
the bottom.

06:26.483 --> 06:28.450
(laughs) Human nature, right?

06:28.485 --> 06:29.985
Who the fuck designed us, right?

06:30.019 --> 06:32.788
I don't know, Greg.

06:34.624 --> 06:36.692
I'd kill that merger for you.

06:36.726 --> 06:38.761
Kill it dead.

06:38.795 --> 06:40.429
What?!

06:40.464 --> 06:43.365
I'd choke the life out of
that thing for you.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.437
H-How exactly would
you do that?

06:48.472 --> 06:50.973
You know Fresh and Tinies,
those little breath strips

06:51.007 --> 06:52.841
that, uh, they make your breath
fresh, and they're really...

06:52.875 --> 06:54.009
Tiny? Yeah.
Right.

06:54.043 --> 06:56.678
I go through like three packs a day.

06:56.712 --> 07:00.214
Fresh breath is, uh...

07:00.249 --> 07:01.549
an obsession.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.784
(blows air)

07:03.818 --> 07:04.885
Minty.

07:04.919 --> 07:06.853
Oh... right.

07:06.888 --> 07:08.488
Major cash cow for ConHealth.

07:08.522 --> 07:11.858
Half a billion in sales
in the first year alone.

07:11.892 --> 07:13.292
And the patent is priceless.

07:13.327 --> 07:14.660
Where is this going, Greg?

07:14.695 --> 07:16.296
Skip helped bring them to market.

07:16.330 --> 07:18.297
In fact, that fancy beach house
in sunny Laguna

07:18.331 --> 07:19.665
was bought and paid for

07:19.699 --> 07:22.134
in no small part by
the ten-mill ConHealth

07:22.168 --> 07:25.505
deposited in Skip's
passbook savings account.

07:25.539 --> 07:28.074
Are you saying ConHealth paid
Skip ten million in fees?

07:28.109 --> 07:29.842
(laughing)

07:29.877 --> 07:31.811
That would be... that would be
excessive, wouldn't it?

07:31.845 --> 07:35.014
Especially because Skip
wasn't consulting ConHealth.

07:35.049 --> 07:36.917
Not officially, anyway.

07:36.951 --> 07:39.886
(slaps button, elevator whirrs)

07:39.921 --> 07:42.856
He was, however,
consulting Rogers & Rogers...

07:42.890 --> 07:45.658
their arch-rival.

07:49.262 --> 07:50.930
Skip sold the technology.

07:50.964 --> 07:53.532
Boom.

07:53.566 --> 07:55.934
(laughs)

07:58.405 --> 08:00.206
Daddy...

08:00.240 --> 08:02.241
we have something that's going
to make you very happy.

08:02.275 --> 08:03.776
Well, two things, actually.

08:03.811 --> 08:06.379
Doug, nobody gives a fuck
about your mix CD.

08:06.413 --> 08:07.447
Okay.

08:09.549 --> 08:10.582
No.

08:12.585 --> 08:15.353
Holy shit.

08:15.388 --> 08:16.454
Are you fucking...

08:16.489 --> 08:18.289
Where did you get this?

08:18.324 --> 08:20.124
I was tipped off by Norbert.

08:20.159 --> 08:22.626
What, he gave you this out
of the goodness of his heart?

08:22.661 --> 08:24.862
Turns out Norbert wants to fuck Jeannie.

08:24.896 --> 08:28.131
Preferably in Santa Cruz
in a big pool of cucumber dip.

08:28.165 --> 08:29.766
Whatever. Something's going on

08:29.800 --> 08:31.768
with Norbert, okay?
He's changed. I don't know.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.936
He's not the same guy
that we met in New York.

08:33.970 --> 08:35.736
Wow.
All that information,

08:35.772 --> 08:37.639
has been independently verified.

08:37.674 --> 08:39.307
CLYDE:
That's real, Daddy.

08:39.342 --> 08:41.808
Go away, go away.
So you're good? You're good, right?

08:41.844 --> 08:44.412
Yeah, and thanks.
You're welcome.

08:45.980 --> 08:48.581
Okay.

08:54.187 --> 08:56.888
A little early
for the vote, aren't you?

08:56.923 --> 08:58.924
Or were you trying
to move it up again?

08:58.958 --> 09:00.625
Fuck me up in some way?

09:00.659 --> 09:02.927
Suck my dick.

09:02.961 --> 09:05.563
Skippy, language.

09:05.597 --> 09:07.464
No, suck my dick.

09:07.499 --> 09:10.267
I'm not trying to be crude or anything.
It's a serious offer.

09:10.302 --> 09:13.271
If you fellate me,
I will change my vote.

09:13.305 --> 09:15.006
How's that?
Don't get me wrong--

09:15.040 --> 09:16.907
I'm not gay or anything, never had

09:16.942 --> 09:19.276
a gay thought really.
Certainly not, uh...

09:19.310 --> 09:21.612
(laughing) attracted to you.

09:21.646 --> 09:23.346
It's just the thought

09:23.381 --> 09:25.449
of Marty Kaan getting
down on his knees

09:25.483 --> 09:28.953
and you know, doing what he's
got to do to save his skin.

09:28.987 --> 09:31.355
I don't know--
it's very arousing.

09:31.389 --> 09:33.924
You know what, maybe
I should suck your dick.

09:33.958 --> 09:36.527
I've already got your balls
in my hand.

09:36.561 --> 09:39.630
You're going to want to look at that.

09:39.664 --> 09:41.699
I've highlighted the real tasty bits.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.675
Now I know you wanted a seat
at the big boy table

09:50.710 --> 09:52.777
and all of the goodies
that go along with it.

09:52.811 --> 09:55.679
And it's going to be hard,
oh, so very hard for you,

09:55.714 --> 09:58.048
but you're going to vote
to kill the merger.

10:03.522 --> 10:05.956
No. Not going to happen.

10:05.991 --> 10:07.825
You know, if this were
to be disseminated,

10:07.860 --> 10:09.460
you'd be through here.

10:09.495 --> 10:11.062
I mean, Jesus Christ,
you'd be through everywhere.

10:11.096 --> 10:12.630
And where would you be?

10:12.665 --> 10:14.632
In this little world
that we operate in,

10:14.667 --> 10:16.400
there isn't a very generous spirit

10:16.434 --> 10:17.634
to whistle-blowers.

10:17.669 --> 10:18.969
Go ahead, make it public.

10:19.003 --> 10:21.204
Mutually-assured destruction.

10:21.239 --> 10:22.839
You're a student of the Cold War.

10:22.874 --> 10:24.575
Oh, God, I love the Cold War!
It's fascinating, isn't it?

10:24.609 --> 10:27.678
I am a big fan.
Yeah. Well, then I'm sure you're also aware

10:27.712 --> 10:30.547
that the deterrent aspect of
mutually-assured destruction

10:30.581 --> 10:33.217
is predicated on the assumption
that both parties are rational.

10:33.251 --> 10:35.485
Yeah.
Now, you, while not being

10:35.519 --> 10:38.088
a good person by any stretch,

10:38.122 --> 10:40.557
are at least a rational individual.

10:40.591 --> 10:43.593
I, on the other hand--

10:43.627 --> 10:46.396
I'm a goddamn terrorist.

10:46.430 --> 10:49.700
And I will crash my 767--

10:49.734 --> 10:51.035
phew--

10:51.069 --> 10:53.804
right into your prodigious
fucking forehead.

10:55.140 --> 10:56.908
(boxing bell ringing) (crowd roaring)

11:00.546 --> 11:02.748
- So Skip thought he had
me on the ropes, right? - Uh-huh. Yeah.

11:02.782 --> 11:04.082
And then I turned.

11:04.117 --> 11:07.119
And I carried him for about six seconds.
Uh-huh.

11:07.154 --> 11:09.088
And then bang!
Whoa!

11:09.122 --> 11:10.255
Down goes...

11:10.290 --> 11:11.857
Frazier!
...Frazier!

11:11.891 --> 11:13.725
Oh, man, you are the king,
man. You're a god.

11:13.760 --> 11:15.259
Ooh!

11:15.294 --> 11:17.728
Holy shit, shit!

11:20.332 --> 11:22.599
I am so sorry.

11:22.634 --> 11:25.102
Well, you should have seen
him outside that school today.

11:25.136 --> 11:26.636
He was scared and alone.
I know.

11:26.671 --> 11:30.073
Thank God he called me.
Monica, take it easy. Okay.

11:30.108 --> 11:34.478
Listen, I-- I got
caught up at work, okay?

11:34.512 --> 11:36.780
It's-It's never going to happen
again, I promise.

11:36.814 --> 11:38.248
Roscoe?

11:42.920 --> 11:45.422
MAN: Roscoe's a sweet kid.
He'll come around.

11:45.457 --> 11:48.058
Marty, there's somebody
that I want you to meet.

11:48.092 --> 11:49.626
Aaron Matthews.

11:49.661 --> 11:51.428
Aaron.
Yeah.

11:51.462 --> 11:53.497
I was having the most
horrible migraines,

11:53.531 --> 11:57.301
so I went in to get an MRI,
and Aaron was my radiologist.

11:57.335 --> 11:59.303
Oh! It was kismet.

11:59.337 --> 12:01.404
Wow, he's seen the inside of your head

12:01.439 --> 12:03.273
and he still wants to date you.

12:03.307 --> 12:06.109
Ah, that's cute.
Yeah. (laughing weakly)

12:06.144 --> 12:08.612
So in regards to, uh, Roscoe...
Yeah?

12:08.646 --> 12:10.113
My sense--

12:10.148 --> 12:13.317
he just wants to feel like you put him

12:13.351 --> 12:14.451
first occasionally.

12:14.486 --> 12:16.353
You're a clinical psychologist?

12:16.388 --> 12:18.155
Radiologist. Radiologist.
Oh, radiologist.

12:18.190 --> 12:19.824
Oh, it's Aaron, right?
Right.

12:19.858 --> 12:21.259
Yeah, shut the fuck up!

12:21.293 --> 12:23.594
Can I talk to you over here for a second?
Wow.

12:23.629 --> 12:25.363
Give me one second.

12:25.398 --> 12:27.032
Wow, he's great, isn't he?

12:27.066 --> 12:28.667
Oh, he is a dreamboat.

12:28.701 --> 12:31.269
But listen, it's not me
you need to convince

12:31.304 --> 12:34.373
that you and Johnny X-Ray would make
a wonderful home for Roscoe.

12:34.408 --> 12:35.775
No, it's the family court judge.

12:35.809 --> 12:36.776
It's not about custody.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.444
No?
Uh-uh.

12:38.479 --> 12:41.548
I think he might actually be the...
Don't. Don't say "the one."

12:41.582 --> 12:44.685
- I hope that you can find someone
emotionally healthy... - Wait a minute.

12:44.719 --> 12:47.221
You should find somebody that
can nurture you and care for you

12:47.255 --> 12:49.123
like Aaron cares for me.
What's happening here?

12:49.157 --> 12:51.392
Are you giving me relationship advice?
'Cause that's fucking bananas.

12:51.427 --> 12:53.494
I think you need it.

12:53.529 --> 12:55.363
MARTY:
Hey, Pop.

12:55.397 --> 12:57.865
Hey, that's Aaron.

12:57.900 --> 12:58.967
How you doing?

12:59.001 --> 13:01.603
Aw, hell.

13:02.671 --> 13:04.572
Hey, Tara.
What up, Tara?

13:04.606 --> 13:07.042
Hey, guys.

13:08.277 --> 13:11.579
Hey, Jeannie.
Hey.

13:14.417 --> 13:17.252
I like your earrings.

13:18.521 --> 13:19.888
Oh, thanks.

13:25.428 --> 13:26.595
No.

13:26.629 --> 13:28.230
Fuck, she's hot.
Yeah.

13:28.264 --> 13:30.198
She's so hot.
God.

13:30.233 --> 13:33.401
I just want to encase her in wax
and put her in a glass box,

13:33.436 --> 13:35.604
you know what I mean...?
Oh, shit.

13:35.638 --> 13:37.939
Doug is now giving me $20
every time he says something

13:37.973 --> 13:40.108
that makes him sound
like a serial killer.

13:40.142 --> 13:41.609
Thank you, Douglas.

13:41.644 --> 13:43.578
Tara's fine, I guess.

13:43.613 --> 13:45.713
Fine? Jeannie, that's what
you think fine looks like?

13:45.748 --> 13:49.517
Maybe she means foiiin!
Jeannie, do you mean foiiin?

13:49.552 --> 13:53.689
She's got the kind of looks you can
tell aren't going to age well.

13:53.723 --> 13:55.591
Oh, my God, Jeannie, you're right.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.427
I didn't notice it before,
but she's fucking heinous.

13:58.461 --> 14:01.029
You know, Tara is
fucking the Rainmaker.

14:01.064 --> 14:02.231
Shut up.

14:02.265 --> 14:04.199
What?
Mm-hmm.

14:04.234 --> 14:06.368
No. He's, like, a thousand.

14:06.403 --> 14:07.736
He's not a thousand.

14:07.771 --> 14:10.072
That Tara? She could
get anyone she wants.

14:10.106 --> 14:11.707
Why would she...?
With the Rainmaker?

14:11.741 --> 14:13.976
McFly, she's fucking her way
to the top.

14:14.010 --> 14:15.978
And honestly, if I thought it
would grease the wheels,

14:16.012 --> 14:17.646
I would run a train on Eyebrows

14:17.681 --> 14:20.283
and Ink Stain. No, I get it.
Me, too.

14:20.317 --> 14:22.385
You know, to grease my wheels,
I'd watch those old coots

14:22.419 --> 14:25.155
sex up their wives, you know.
Hell, I'd film it.

14:25.189 --> 14:26.122
(imitating electronic tones)

14:26.157 --> 14:27.757
Now what happened? Yeah!
Shit.

14:27.792 --> 14:29.626
I want to bank some.
Smart.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.995
I'm sure her reasons
are more complicated than that.

14:32.029 --> 14:34.264
Complicated how?
JEANNIE: I don't know, Clyde.

14:34.298 --> 14:37.767
I'm not a fucking Tara expert!
CLYDE: What the fuck just happened?

14:37.801 --> 14:39.802
Hey, guys, guys.

14:43.140 --> 14:44.174
JEANNIE:
Is he...?

14:44.208 --> 14:45.709
Oh, my God.

14:51.649 --> 14:53.349
What the hell are you doing?

14:55.052 --> 14:58.688
What? Just leaving you
a little present.

14:58.722 --> 15:00.456
You know, to remember me by.

15:00.490 --> 15:02.591
It's not an Almond Joy.

15:02.626 --> 15:04.293
So don't eat it.

15:04.327 --> 15:05.527
Or do. You know, your call.

15:05.562 --> 15:08.030
Just couldn't resist

15:08.064 --> 15:11.133
leaking our little secret
to the senior partners, huh?

15:11.168 --> 15:13.703
What are you... I didn't leak
any secret to the senior...

15:13.737 --> 15:15.505
I'm out, Marty!
I am out!

15:15.539 --> 15:17.541
You happy?

15:17.575 --> 15:20.944
The firm has put my shares in escrow

15:20.979 --> 15:23.481
pending a criminal investigation.

15:23.515 --> 15:26.150
Jesus, Skip, I didn't
leak anything, okay?

15:26.184 --> 15:27.685
Why would I do that?

15:27.719 --> 15:28.986
I don't know--
because your buddy

15:29.021 --> 15:30.788
the Rainmaker
now sits atop the throne.

15:30.823 --> 15:34.858
Because you're a fucking
sociopath! I don't know

15:34.893 --> 15:36.226
why you do anything you do!

15:36.261 --> 15:39.529
In about five minutes, a
security guard will emerge

15:39.564 --> 15:42.499
from that elevator and escort
me... (laughing)

15:42.533 --> 15:44.001
out of my own building.

15:44.035 --> 15:47.404
I'll pass those big letters out
front-- Galweather Stearn.

15:47.438 --> 15:49.072
I don't own my own name.

15:49.107 --> 15:52.409
You ripped away my name from me!

15:56.113 --> 15:57.881
You just started World War III, pal.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.316
You better nuke up.

16:01.353 --> 16:05.489
Oh, by the way, I left another couple of
little presents around here somewhere.

16:05.524 --> 16:07.492
Good luck finding them.

16:23.575 --> 16:25.409
Oh, yeah.
What was that about?

16:25.443 --> 16:27.111
That's... Yeah.
Oh, my God.

16:27.145 --> 16:28.946
(whistles) That is about somebody

16:28.980 --> 16:30.914
leaked the info.

16:30.949 --> 16:32.416
Turns out soul suckers

16:32.450 --> 16:35.286
like Greg Norbert don't have
any hidden depths, Jeannie.

16:35.321 --> 16:37.856
I thought he...

16:37.890 --> 16:39.591
I'm sorry.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.627
DOUG: Yeah, you know, it doesn't
seem that bad to me.

16:42.662 --> 16:45.297
Hey, Doug, Skip just dropped a couple
of Jackson Brownes inside Marty's briefcase.

16:45.331 --> 16:47.198
So I kind of think...
How dare you!

16:47.233 --> 16:49.701
- Jackson Browne is not only
a terrific songwriter... - Shut the fuck up.

16:49.735 --> 16:51.937
...he is a committed environmentalist, who...
Doug, shut the fuck up!

16:51.971 --> 16:53.705
It's okay.
Okay, it's fine, I'm fine. (clears throat)

16:53.740 --> 16:55.274
I'm digressing.

16:55.308 --> 16:57.643
Look, what I'm trying to say is
that I-I don't understand

16:57.678 --> 16:59.779
why everyone's acting like
it's the end of the world.

16:59.813 --> 17:03.250
Honestly, Eyebrows and Ink Stain
will line up

17:03.284 --> 17:05.719
behind the Rainmaker, because he's
the most powerful man in the room.

17:05.753 --> 17:07.954
Which means the votes are there
to kill the merger.

17:07.989 --> 17:10.124
Now correct me if I'm wrong,
but that was the goal.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.794
Wasn't it?

17:12.828 --> 17:16.329
Come on, so you got
a little blindsided.

17:16.365 --> 17:19.467
So there's some caca
in your Hermes bag.

17:19.501 --> 17:21.068
Big whoop.

17:21.103 --> 17:23.137
You know, if someone
had told us three months ago

17:23.171 --> 17:25.005
that we'd be standing here,
a little dinged up,

17:25.039 --> 17:27.107
a few sleepless nights
under our belts, but alive,

17:27.142 --> 17:29.076
hey, you got to turn that frown

17:29.110 --> 17:30.310
upside down.

17:30.345 --> 17:31.745
We should be celebrating,

17:31.780 --> 17:33.847
I think.

17:33.882 --> 17:35.816
I mean, right?

17:39.287 --> 17:41.255
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

17:41.289 --> 17:42.823
So what?

17:42.858 --> 17:44.091
Harrison Galweather the Third

17:44.125 --> 17:46.127
took a big shit in my briefcase.

17:46.161 --> 17:48.196
That case was getting
pretty banged up anyway.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.665
Yes, it was.
Yeah. If you're getting a new one,

17:50.699 --> 17:51.932
um, I'll have that one.

17:51.967 --> 17:54.135
Doug!
(laughter)

17:54.169 --> 17:56.671
Why are you... why are you
laughing? I'm serious.

17:56.705 --> 17:58.473
Oh, you can have it.
Really?

18:01.309 --> 18:03.310
Eyebrows and Ink Stain are here.

18:03.344 --> 18:06.446
A yes vote indicates
a preference for the merger.

18:06.481 --> 18:08.015
Sorry we're late.

18:08.049 --> 18:10.450
I-I couldn't find my car.

18:10.484 --> 18:11.885
RAINMAKER:
Welcome, gentlemen.

18:11.919 --> 18:13.454
Have a seat.

18:13.488 --> 18:15.823
And a no vote indicates...

18:15.857 --> 18:17.224
You get it.

18:17.259 --> 18:19.794
Oh, for the love of Mike.

18:19.829 --> 18:23.165
RAINMAKER: Stuart, you
want to start us off?

18:23.199 --> 18:25.501
I vote yes.

18:25.535 --> 18:28.338
No.
I vote no.

18:28.372 --> 18:29.839
Yes.

18:30.908 --> 18:32.175
Uh, yes.

18:32.209 --> 18:33.710
Yes.

18:33.744 --> 18:35.645
Yes.

18:35.679 --> 18:37.714
Yes.

18:37.748 --> 18:39.182
Yes.

18:39.217 --> 18:40.817
Yes.

18:40.852 --> 18:42.319
I vote yes.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.002
Hey, buddy.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.271
What do you want me to say, Marty?
How about,

19:00.306 --> 19:02.073
"Whoo! Did it.

19:02.107 --> 19:04.742
"Finally got my seat
at the big boy table.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.177
Didn't even get my hands dirty."

19:06.211 --> 19:07.612
You know what else you could say?

19:07.646 --> 19:09.548
"Hey, you ever hear the one
about the sap

19:09.582 --> 19:11.683
who fucking trusted
everything I said?"

19:11.717 --> 19:13.552
Look, will you sit down?

19:13.586 --> 19:15.587
Come on. Let's talk.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.722
I'd love to do that, but I got to go

19:17.757 --> 19:19.224
down the hall
and congratulate Norbert.

19:19.258 --> 19:21.226
Norbert didn't know anything.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.262
What do you mean,
he didn't know anything?

19:23.296 --> 19:24.530
He didn't.

19:24.565 --> 19:27.701
He knew what I put there
for him to see.

19:27.735 --> 19:30.404
When he told Jeannie what he told her,

19:30.438 --> 19:32.573
he really thought
he was killing the merger.

19:32.607 --> 19:34.775
You know he had a genuine epiphany?

19:34.809 --> 19:36.711
I mean, like, he was reborn.

19:36.745 --> 19:39.213
I can't believe this shit, man.

19:39.248 --> 19:41.315
This is the kind of shit
we do to other people.

19:42.484 --> 19:44.385
You hate my guts.
I get it.

19:44.420 --> 19:46.788
Go fuck yourself, man.

19:48.524 --> 19:51.092
Look, this is not personal.

19:51.127 --> 19:52.860
It... it's...

19:54.363 --> 19:56.331
I know. Forget it.

20:02.939 --> 20:04.606
No. No.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.875
Marty.
No! What's going on?

20:17.487 --> 20:18.955
MARTY: Okay, hold it.
That was really close.

20:18.989 --> 20:20.457
This one's going in, though.

20:20.491 --> 20:21.691
Oh, is it?
On, no, no! It's a numbers game.

20:21.726 --> 20:23.360
Oh, what...

20:23.394 --> 20:24.761
Dude!

20:24.796 --> 20:26.263
My bad, man.

20:26.297 --> 20:28.465
Three out of 24 ain't bad.
These are not

20:28.499 --> 20:29.699
regulation peanuts.
Good point-- if they had

20:29.734 --> 20:31.435
been properly dimensioned peanuts...

20:31.469 --> 20:33.437
That whole handful would have gone in.
Absolutely.

20:33.471 --> 20:34.871
Really?
Last call.

20:34.906 --> 20:36.306
I don't have to go home,

20:36.340 --> 20:38.608
but I got to get
the hell out of here, right?

20:38.643 --> 20:40.277
Are you okay?

20:40.311 --> 20:42.279
Yeah. No, I'm fine.

20:42.313 --> 20:45.449
Yeah? Why don't you stick around
and tell me what's wrong?

20:45.483 --> 20:46.850
I've had a great time.

20:46.885 --> 20:48.118
This has been so much fun.

20:48.153 --> 20:49.553
It's exactly what I needed--

20:49.588 --> 20:52.122
you pouring me drinks,
me drinking the drinks.

20:52.157 --> 20:54.224
(both chuckling)

20:54.259 --> 20:55.792
But I don't really know you.

20:55.827 --> 20:57.160
I don't want to be rude--
it's just,

20:57.195 --> 20:58.395
I don't think I should start...

20:58.429 --> 20:59.663
Why don't I catch you up?

20:59.697 --> 21:01.297
I'm 26 years old.

21:01.332 --> 21:03.466
Uh, hold on a second.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.834
(clears throat)

21:04.868 --> 21:06.302
Oh, you're going to take notes.

21:06.336 --> 21:08.303
I got to get this down.
Yeah.

21:08.338 --> 21:10.539
26 years old.
26.

21:10.574 --> 21:12.208
I was born and raised in L.A.

21:12.242 --> 21:13.976
Divorced parents.

21:14.011 --> 21:15.345
Uh, lived with my mom.

21:15.379 --> 21:17.180
That old chestnut.
Mm-hmm.

21:17.215 --> 21:20.150
I've had three serious relationships.

21:20.185 --> 21:22.153
Wow.
Two I ended,

21:22.187 --> 21:24.222
one who broke my heart.

21:24.256 --> 21:26.525
Like the bumper sticker says,
I'd rather be surfing.

21:26.559 --> 21:28.494
Dogs, not cats.

21:28.528 --> 21:30.429
Fuck cats. Hate cats.
Yeah.

21:30.463 --> 21:32.331
Gross.
Why'd God make them?

21:32.365 --> 21:37.103
Uh, my favorite Bronte sister
is, uh, Charlotte.

21:37.137 --> 21:38.838
You have a favorite Bronte sister?

21:38.873 --> 21:40.507
That's 'cause I was
a lit major at Yale.

21:40.541 --> 21:41.842
But it does raise
an interesting question.

21:41.876 --> 21:43.277
Why is an Ivy League grad

21:43.312 --> 21:45.213
hawking drinks
at a dive bar in Mar Vista?

21:45.247 --> 21:46.681
You've been asked this before.

21:46.715 --> 21:48.750
Yes, I have-- a lot.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.719
And you answer...?

21:50.754 --> 21:53.088
I say that I don't know.

21:53.122 --> 21:54.890
But I'm happy.

21:54.924 --> 21:56.792
That's emotionally healthy.
Yeah.

21:56.826 --> 21:59.228
Thank you. You say it
like it's a bad thing.

21:59.262 --> 22:00.929
No, no, no. I was...

22:00.964 --> 22:03.065
I'm... somebody said something
earlier to me today,

22:03.099 --> 22:05.101
and th-that's...
that's a good answer.

22:05.135 --> 22:06.602
It's-it's a very good thing.

22:06.636 --> 22:08.938
Emotionally healthy.
Thank you.

22:08.972 --> 22:10.539
Enough stalling.

22:10.574 --> 22:12.241
Bare your soul.

22:12.275 --> 22:13.476
(laughs)

22:13.510 --> 22:14.977
I don't want to play.

22:15.012 --> 22:16.612
Why?

22:16.647 --> 22:18.714
I think the only reason
you've been talking to me

22:18.749 --> 22:20.550
is because you think
I'm a decent person,

22:20.584 --> 22:22.585
and if I start unpacking my soul,

22:22.619 --> 22:24.887
you're going to...
you're going to hate me.

22:24.921 --> 22:28.057
I'll hate you
if you don't bare your soul.

22:31.928 --> 22:34.063
(sighs)

22:34.098 --> 22:36.733
Um...

22:36.768 --> 22:38.802
I had a huge
professional setback today.

22:38.836 --> 22:40.437
Somebody who I trusted,

22:40.471 --> 22:43.140
somebody who I respected,
singled me out

22:43.175 --> 22:46.077
and spun me around and
stabbed me right in the back.

22:46.111 --> 22:48.680
God, that's awful.
I'm sorry.

22:48.714 --> 22:50.782
Yeah, shit, I probably deserved it.

22:50.817 --> 22:52.651
Have a ten-year-old
who hasn't spoken

22:52.686 --> 22:55.821
to me in four days.

22:55.856 --> 22:58.424
I made a bad decision, and...

22:58.458 --> 23:01.595
there are consequences, right?

23:01.629 --> 23:05.132
His childhood has just...

23:05.166 --> 23:07.868
he's had so much shit thrown at him,

23:07.903 --> 23:09.870
and he's always
just taken it in stride.

23:09.904 --> 23:11.205
You know, with a smile,

23:11.239 --> 23:12.673
a little...
a little song and dance.

23:12.707 --> 23:14.108
He's a musical theater geek.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.376
That's very cute.

23:15.410 --> 23:16.877
He didn't really shrug this one off

23:16.912 --> 23:20.715
like I'd hoped, and, um...

23:20.749 --> 23:24.484
I-I haven't really been able
to... to... to help,

23:24.519 --> 23:27.020
because I'm so dug in at work.

23:27.054 --> 23:28.521
Fathers get busy--
it doesn't mean

23:28.556 --> 23:30.189
that they don't want
to be with their...

23:30.224 --> 23:31.491
No, it's not...
it's not...

23:31.525 --> 23:32.959
No, I was busy.
I was busy.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.361
I am busy.

23:34.395 --> 23:36.563
You know, work...

23:36.597 --> 23:38.398
there's a lot of
pressing issues at work.

23:38.433 --> 23:39.800
But that's how I want it,

23:39.835 --> 23:44.672
because I know what I'm doing at work.

23:44.707 --> 23:48.209
And at home, with him...

23:48.244 --> 23:50.612
I don't have a fucking clue.

23:54.084 --> 23:55.351
And I love him.

23:55.385 --> 23:56.919
I really do.

23:56.953 --> 24:01.490
I love him so fucking much,
and I'm just...

24:01.525 --> 24:03.660
I'm failing him,

24:03.694 --> 24:05.562
and I know it.

24:05.596 --> 24:08.433
And I can't stop it.

24:10.936 --> 24:12.570
And I've said too much.

24:12.604 --> 24:14.539
No. No. Not at all.
Yes, I did.

24:14.573 --> 24:16.541
Look, thank you.
I'm going to take off.

24:16.575 --> 24:18.509
I appreciate it.
Uh, wait.

24:18.543 --> 24:20.678
Actually, are you hungry at all?

24:20.713 --> 24:22.213
Am I hungry?
Yeah,

24:22.247 --> 24:23.748
because I'm starving.

24:23.783 --> 24:25.617
And I don't know your stance
on hamburgers,

24:25.652 --> 24:28.120
but I know a place where you can get,

24:28.154 --> 24:30.556
like, the best hamburger of your life.

24:30.591 --> 24:33.392
(heavy breathing, moaning)

24:36.762 --> 24:39.130
(both chuckling)

24:40.600 --> 24:42.400
Wow. That was a great hamburger.

24:42.435 --> 24:43.702
You, too.

24:43.736 --> 24:45.871
(laughs)

24:45.905 --> 24:48.072
Um, a cigarette?

24:48.107 --> 24:50.208
Uh, no, thank you.

24:50.242 --> 24:51.976
All right.

24:52.010 --> 24:53.878
I'm out.

24:53.912 --> 24:55.580
I know, I'm a total poseur.

24:57.516 --> 24:59.751
Hey, Rosie.

24:59.785 --> 25:01.720
This you and your dad?

25:01.754 --> 25:03.889
Don't look at that.

25:03.923 --> 25:05.291
Why not?

25:05.325 --> 25:07.593
It's embarrassing.
No, it's not.

25:07.628 --> 25:09.128
It's sweet.

25:09.163 --> 25:11.063
Daddy's little girl, huh?

25:11.098 --> 25:12.665
I like that.

25:17.471 --> 25:19.805
No fucking way.
What?

25:19.840 --> 25:21.140
That is fucking crazy.

25:21.174 --> 25:22.574
I know this guy.

25:22.609 --> 25:24.076
How do you know my dad?

25:24.110 --> 25:26.311
Uh, our... our paths crossed
in business.

25:26.346 --> 25:27.579
Small world.

25:27.613 --> 25:30.982
Um... you can stay if you want.

25:31.017 --> 25:33.785
I would love to,
but I got to get home to my kid.

25:33.820 --> 25:35.120
Right.

25:35.154 --> 25:36.662
Okay.

25:36.782 --> 25:38.680
Hold on one second.

25:50.334 --> 25:52.135
Call me.

25:52.170 --> 25:54.138
Okay.

26:01.047 --> 26:02.281
Hey.

26:02.315 --> 26:04.116
Tell your dad
next time you talk to him

26:04.150 --> 26:05.685
that Marty Kaan says hello.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.522
Bye, Marty.

26:19.065 --> 26:21.366
