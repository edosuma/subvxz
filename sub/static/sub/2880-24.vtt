WEBVTT

00:03.864 --> 00:05.965
How's your mom
holding up?

00:05.967 --> 00:09.135
She's doing okay, but we just
lost another nurse.

00:09.137 --> 00:10.370
How many is that now?

00:10.372 --> 00:12.038
Two, and I know what
you're thinking--

00:12.040 --> 00:14.207
she's eating them.

00:16.277 --> 00:18.544
She's just so impossible,
they keep quitting.

00:18.546 --> 00:20.146
So, who's
watching her now?

00:20.148 --> 00:23.750
A bowl full of M&M's with
a few Ambien tossed in.

00:23.752 --> 00:25.318
What up, guys?

00:25.320 --> 00:26.586
Hello. - Hey.  -Hello.

00:26.588 --> 00:28.621
Okay.

00:28.623 --> 00:30.123
Well, now that
everyone's here,

00:30.125 --> 00:32.759
Penny and I have
some big news.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.560
We're engaged!

00:41.035 --> 00:43.236
And I thought me having sex with
Emily was gonna be the big news.

00:47.108 --> 00:48.775
Hey! Hey!

00:49.943 --> 00:51.978
What the hell!

00:51.980 --> 00:53.780
You guys propose all the time.

00:53.782 --> 00:56.082
This never happens.

00:56.084 --> 00:57.550

01:29.588 --> 01:32.490
Boy, I'm so
hungry today.

01:32.492 --> 01:35.259
I wonder why?

01:36.629 --> 01:38.496
Because you had sex
the other night?

01:38.698 --> 01:40.665
You know what?

01:40.667 --> 01:43.368
That may be it.

01:44.770 --> 01:46.938
By the way,
it isn't like riding a bike.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.107
Like, I fell off a few times.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.276
Hey, buddy.

01:52.278 --> 01:54.112
Hello.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.380
You okay?

01:55.382 --> 01:57.148
I just got called

01:57.150 --> 01:59.517
into President Siebert's office.

01:59.519 --> 02:01.052
The university

02:01.054 --> 02:04.922
won't let me switch my field of
study to inflationary cosmology.

02:04.924 --> 02:08.059
They're forcing me
to continue with string theory.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.693
Why?

02:09.696 --> 02:11.162
He said it's why they hired me,

02:11.164 --> 02:13.398
it's-it's what my grant
was designated for,

02:13.400 --> 02:16.968
and that everybody has to do
things they don't want to do.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.303
He then gave an example
of something he had to do,

02:19.305 --> 02:20.438
even though he didn't want to,

02:20.440 --> 02:23.508
which was look
at my stupid face.

02:23.510 --> 02:25.676
That's a rude thing to say.

02:25.678 --> 02:28.045
Out loud.

02:30.282 --> 02:31.716
It's an outrage.

02:31.718 --> 02:34.051
Honestly, I'm tempted
to leave the university.

02:34.053 --> 02:36.120
You know, if you're really
serious about that,

02:36.122 --> 02:38.523
I hear there are
some exciting opportunities

02:38.525 --> 02:41.859
in home care
for the old and fat.

02:41.861 --> 02:45.296
Whatever you do, just don't
make any rash decisions.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.531
I don't know.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.266
I am really aggravated.

02:49.568 --> 02:52.136
When I'm feeling low,
I have sex with a girl.

02:53.405 --> 02:55.706
But that's just me.

02:58.277 --> 03:01.345
Oh, come on, give her a chance.
No.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.080
Life, it is too short.

03:03.082 --> 03:06.184
I know you've only been
here a day and a half,

03:06.186 --> 03:07.819
but you're like
part of the family!

03:09.956 --> 03:13.591
I don't think the service is
gonna send any more people.

03:13.593 --> 03:18.863
Yeah, maybe it's time we just
release Ma back into the sea.

03:20.999 --> 03:22.767
That's not helpful.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.703
Well, then, we may need
to get used to the idea

03:25.705 --> 03:29.207
that we're gonna be living
here the next few months.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.475
But we have jobs.

03:30.477 --> 03:32.610
We can't baby-sit her
24 hours a day.

03:32.612 --> 03:35.413
Well, what if we use
our vacation time?

03:35.415 --> 03:39.350
I wanted to go to Hawaii,
not Hell.

03:39.352 --> 03:41.419
I don't know
what else we can do.

03:41.421 --> 03:44.989
Howie, I love you,

03:44.991 --> 03:47.124
and as your wife, your
mother is every bit

03:47.126 --> 03:50.094
as much my problem as
she is yours, so...

03:50.096 --> 03:53.498
I want a divorce.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.469
Hello, Leonard.

03:58.471 --> 03:59.937
Hi, Mom.

03:59.939 --> 04:02.006
I have some exciting news.

04:02.008 --> 04:04.775
I'm listening.

04:04.777 --> 04:07.578
Before I tell you,
will you promise to try

04:07.580 --> 04:11.582
and be happy for me and keep any
concerns you have to yourself?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.618
No.

04:13.620 --> 04:18.856
Let me save you
all of your hemming and hawing.

04:18.858 --> 04:22.293
Sheldon already told me
that you and Penny are engaged.

04:22.295 --> 04:26.564
I-I hate that you talk to him
more than you talk to me.

04:26.566 --> 04:29.433
Would you <i>like</i> for you and me
to talk more?

04:31.470 --> 04:33.804
You know what?
It's probably fine.

04:33.806 --> 04:37.842
In any event, while I've had
my misgivings about...

04:37.844 --> 04:40.044
Penny...

04:41.313 --> 04:43.381
...Sheldon spoke
very fondly of her,

04:43.383 --> 04:45.616
and if she is good enough
for him,

04:45.618 --> 04:47.885
then she's good enough for me.

04:49.755 --> 04:51.222
I'm your son.

04:51.224 --> 04:54.191
What about the fact
that she's good enough for me?

04:55.761 --> 04:57.662
Sure.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.664
Thanks, Mom.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.666
Leonard,
would it make you feel better

05:01.668 --> 05:06.504
to hear that your mother
approved of your life choices?

05:06.506 --> 05:09.473
Yes, it would.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.177
Yeah. Well,
you should work on that.

05:16.782 --> 05:18.649
No, Mom, it's the same guy

05:18.651 --> 05:21.385
I've been going out with
for the past two years.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.454
Yeah, the scientist.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.822
Well, it's complicated.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.326
I mean, he works with lasers
and atomic magnets.

05:30.262 --> 05:33.197
No, I did not see it coming.

05:33.199 --> 05:37.401
No, we did not set a date.

05:38.670 --> 05:40.705
Yeah, this is a first
for our family.

05:40.707 --> 05:42.573
All right, tell Dad I love him.

05:42.575 --> 05:43.608
I gotta go.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.709
All right, bye.

05:44.711 --> 05:45.810
Atomic magnets?

05:45.812 --> 05:46.944
Shut up.

05:48.247 --> 05:50.081
Sorry I'm late.

05:50.083 --> 05:53.884
The leaf blower broke, so I had
to hand-dry my mother-in-law.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.387
You want some wine?

05:56.389 --> 05:57.321
Thanks.

05:57.323 --> 05:59.090
Little warning
before you jump into

05:59.092 --> 06:00.091
this marriage business:

06:00.093 --> 06:01.392
You're not just marrying him,

06:01.394 --> 06:02.660
you're marrying his family.

06:02.662 --> 06:05.062
I think Leonard's mom's okay
with me.

06:05.064 --> 06:06.397
It doesn't matter
if she's okay with you.

06:06.399 --> 06:08.833
The question is: Can she go
to the bathroom by herself?

06:13.538 --> 06:16.140
Hit me again.

06:17.576 --> 06:20.544
So, what are the living
arrangements gonna be?

06:20.546 --> 06:22.747
Well, haven't really talked
about it yet, but I figure,

06:22.749 --> 06:25.416
at some point, I'll move in with
him, or he'll move in with me.

06:25.418 --> 06:28.152
Well, with you not working,
that makes financial sense.

06:28.154 --> 06:29.487
You're not working!

06:29.489 --> 06:32.056
How would you like a job
in home health care?

06:32.058 --> 06:34.158
Not a chance.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.860
Please. I'm desperate.
No.

06:35.862 --> 06:38.295
I'll pay you anything you want.
Okay, then, yeah.

06:39.264 --> 06:41.999
No! Keep your money!

06:45.837 --> 06:48.973
I could've ridden a bull
longer than that.

06:51.376 --> 06:53.844
What you working on?

06:53.846 --> 06:55.846
I'm writing an appeal

06:55.848 --> 06:57.081
to the Faculty Senate,

06:57.083 --> 06:59.050
so that I can move on
from string theory.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.518
Oh. How's it going?

07:00.520 --> 07:02.987
You tell me.

07:04.190 --> 07:05.890
"Dear Esteemed Colleagues,

07:05.892 --> 07:07.658
"As you may know,
I have requested

07:07.660 --> 07:09.293
"to change my field of study.

07:09.295 --> 07:10.795
"My decision
to do so

07:10.797 --> 07:13.130
"is, I believe,
in the best interest of science.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.200
"At your convenience, I'd be
happy to explain it to you

07:16.202 --> 07:19.036
in words you'll understand."

07:20.072 --> 07:23.107
It's nice
that you called them "esteemed."

07:23.109 --> 07:25.743
You're right.
I'll take that out.

07:27.212 --> 07:30.648
So, listen, there was something
I was hoping to float past you.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.349
Mm.
Now that Penny and I are engaged,

07:32.351 --> 07:35.619
I thought we might want to talk
about our living arrangements.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.655
Of course.

07:37.657 --> 07:40.424
She's spent many nights here,
and you're worried

07:40.426 --> 07:45.029
about preserving the myth of her
virginity before the wedding.

07:46.898 --> 07:48.799
I'm not.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.735
Good, because not only has
that ship sailed,

07:50.737 --> 07:54.271
if it hit an iceberg,
countless men would perish.

07:54.273 --> 07:58.175
Actually, this is about where
she and I are going to live.

07:58.177 --> 07:59.677
What do you mean?

07:59.679 --> 08:02.747
Well... well, we might want
to live together.

08:02.749 --> 08:06.150
Oh, yeah, well, I've already
given this some thought,

08:06.152 --> 08:07.318
and...

08:07.320 --> 08:10.387
I'm willing
to let Penny live with us

08:10.389 --> 08:13.524
one day a week
for a trial period.

08:15.127 --> 08:18.129
Now, obviously,
not when she's made cranky

08:18.131 --> 08:21.332
by the shedding
of her uterine lining.

08:23.001 --> 08:24.368
That's very sweet.

08:25.937 --> 08:30.307
But we were thinking more of us
maybe living together with...

08:30.309 --> 08:32.510
not you.

08:35.212 --> 08:37.381
I don't understand.

08:38.549 --> 08:41.818
How could we all live together
if I'm not there?

08:42.721 --> 08:44.889
Look, I-I know
this is... this is change,

08:44.891 --> 08:46.891
and that sounds scary, but...

08:46.893 --> 08:48.526
Where are you going to go?

08:48.528 --> 08:50.094
I don't know.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.962
We just started
to think about this.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.497
Maybe I'll move
in with Penny,

08:53.499 --> 08:55.599
or maybe she and
I'll take this place,

08:55.601 --> 08:56.901
and you can move
across the hall.

08:56.903 --> 08:59.236
Move across the hall?!

08:59.838 --> 09:02.706
Did you take a marijuana?!

09:04.943 --> 09:06.911
No, I did not.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.647
Did you get hit
on the head with a coconut?

09:09.649 --> 09:11.482
No.
Well, then,

09:11.484 --> 09:12.917
I'm all out of guesses.

09:12.919 --> 09:14.285
What? Me move across the hall--

09:14.287 --> 09:16.420
Why would you even suggest
such a thing?

09:16.422 --> 09:17.788
Because I love Penny,

09:17.790 --> 09:20.224
and want to give her
the life she deserves.

09:20.226 --> 09:22.193
I see.

09:22.195 --> 09:25.462
You're putting your future
bride's happiness above mine.

09:27.365 --> 09:30.201
Well, yeah.

09:30.203 --> 09:32.636
Wow.

09:34.000 --> 09:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:42.137 --> 09:46.040
How dare the university force me
to go back to string theory!

09:46.042 --> 09:47.775
They just don't appreciate you.

09:47.777 --> 09:50.245
Yeah, and on top of that,
Leonard has the audacity

09:50.247 --> 09:52.747
to suggest that now
that he and Penny are engaged,

09:52.749 --> 09:54.883
he may not want
to live with me anymore.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.051
Here, I made you some
Strawberry Quik.

09:57.053 --> 09:58.887
I have real problems here, Amy.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.756
I can't be mollified with a
beverage designed for children.

10:02.726 --> 10:04.225
Mmm! Yummy.

10:05.594 --> 10:07.996
You know, this might
work out for the best.

10:07.998 --> 10:09.564
I mean, you're
always complaining

10:09.566 --> 10:11.499
about what a terrible
roommate Leonard is.

10:11.501 --> 10:12.800
Like how he turns up

10:12.802 --> 10:14.202
the thermostat when
you're not there.

10:14.204 --> 10:17.372
Ugh! It's like walking
into the Amazon.

10:17.374 --> 10:19.874
And not the good Amazon
with one-day shipping.

10:19.876 --> 10:23.144
The awful one
with birds and snakes.

10:23.146 --> 10:26.180
You hate the sound of all
those keys on his key chain.

10:26.182 --> 10:28.216
Four keys!

10:28.218 --> 10:30.351
Who does he think
he is, a warden?

10:31.453 --> 10:34.322
See? Maybe you'll
love living alone.

10:34.324 --> 10:37.025
I don't know. Perhaps.

10:37.027 --> 10:39.494
And if it turns
out you don't...

10:39.496 --> 10:41.396
you and I could
live together.

10:41.398 --> 10:43.831
You and... Oh, sure.

10:43.833 --> 10:45.266
And while we're at it,

10:45.268 --> 10:46.768
why don't we get engaged, too?

10:46.770 --> 10:49.003
Why don't we get a little house,
start a family?

10:49.005 --> 10:50.438
Enjoy our sunset years together?

10:50.440 --> 10:53.341
Do you hear yourself, woman?!

10:53.343 --> 10:56.177
Sheldon, it was just a thought.
No.

10:56.179 --> 10:57.178
Here's a thought.

10:57.180 --> 10:58.246
You're not moving in,

10:58.248 --> 10:59.347
Leonard's not moving out,

10:59.349 --> 11:05.186
everything stays
exactly the way it is.

11:05.188 --> 11:06.821
and you're supposed
to use the powder!

11:07.790 --> 11:09.190
It tastes the same.

11:09.192 --> 11:11.693
No. The syrup tastes better
and I don't like it.

11:15.264 --> 11:16.898
This is so sweet!

11:16.900 --> 11:18.666
You never cook for me.
Well...

11:18.668 --> 11:21.636
you cook for me
all the time and...

11:21.638 --> 11:24.172
Ugh.

11:24.174 --> 11:25.673
If you don't like my cooking,

11:25.675 --> 11:27.075
why haven't you ever
said anything?

11:27.077 --> 11:31.112
It's hard to talk with
so much heavy chewing to do.

11:31.114 --> 11:33.214
Sorry. I'll get better.

11:33.216 --> 11:37.018
I know you'll try.

11:37.020 --> 11:39.954
So, should we talk
about setting a date?

11:39.956 --> 11:41.623
Well, I'd like
to pick one that works

11:41.625 --> 11:42.690
with my brother's schedule.

11:42.692 --> 11:44.325
Okay.
And when would that be?

11:44.327 --> 11:47.729
Uh, 12 to 18 months from now,
depending on good behavior.

11:49.566 --> 11:51.766
Hi, is Sheldon here?

11:51.768 --> 11:53.134
No, I thought he was with you.

11:53.136 --> 11:55.036
He was, but he stormed off

11:55.038 --> 11:57.472
and now he isn't answering his phone.
What happened?

11:57.474 --> 11:59.674
He was really angry
that you suggested he move out.

11:59.676 --> 12:01.075
Oh.

12:01.077 --> 12:02.644
I also mentioned that he and I
could live together

12:02.646 --> 12:04.178
but he was too mad at you
to realize

12:04.180 --> 12:06.080
what a great idea that is.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.485
Well, he's been having
a couple of tough days.

12:10.487 --> 12:11.686
I'm sure he's fine.
He probably just

12:11.688 --> 12:13.488
needs a little alone
time to decompress.

12:13.490 --> 12:15.490
You're probably right.

12:16.558 --> 12:18.092
So, what are you guys doing?

12:20.162 --> 12:22.897
Well, Leonard cooked for me
and now we're just having

12:22.899 --> 12:27.035
a nice dinner, you know,
as a newly engaged couple.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.437
That's nice.

12:34.209 --> 12:35.977
Anyway, as I was saying,

12:35.979 --> 12:39.280
Sheldon probably just needs
a little alone time.

12:40.315 --> 12:41.275
'Cause that's important.

12:45.487 --> 12:48.456
Not just for him, but for...

12:48.458 --> 12:50.725
most anybody, really.

12:50.727 --> 12:52.560
Don't I know it.

12:52.562 --> 12:53.695
What is that, polenta?

12:53.697 --> 12:55.329
Amy, get out.
Right.

13:01.437 --> 13:02.837
No.

13:05.808 --> 13:07.809
Hey, Sheldon.

13:07.811 --> 13:09.477
What happened?

13:09.479 --> 13:11.345
I was cooking
in the back room last night

13:11.347 --> 13:12.980
and the hot plate
caught on fire.

13:12.982 --> 13:15.683
And you couldn't put it out?

13:15.685 --> 13:16.918
I was across the street

13:16.920 --> 13:19.620
at the do-it-yourself car wash,
taking a shower.

13:22.991 --> 13:24.726
So when will you reopen?

13:24.728 --> 13:26.060
Um, I don't know.

13:26.062 --> 13:29.497
I'm waiting to hear back
from the insurance company.

13:29.499 --> 13:32.066
So, tomorrow?

13:32.068 --> 13:35.203
I don't mean to be rude,
Sheldon, but, uh,

13:35.205 --> 13:37.105
my life is kind of
falling apart right now.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.006
<i>Your</i> life?

13:39.008 --> 13:41.542
The university is making
me do string theory

13:41.544 --> 13:45.246
and my girlfriend loves me so
much she wants to live with me.

13:45.248 --> 13:46.948
And now,

13:46.950 --> 13:51.085
the place I need to go when I'm
sad is damp and smells funny.

13:52.755 --> 13:54.789
Well, sorry I let you down.

13:54.791 --> 13:56.090
No.

13:56.092 --> 13:57.525
I do not accept this.

13:57.527 --> 13:59.794
Everything is changing
and I hate it.

13:59.796 --> 14:01.028
It stops now.

14:01.030 --> 14:02.930
I'm helping you
get back on your feet.

14:04.967 --> 14:08.703
I would like to purchase
this comic book, please.

14:09.705 --> 14:11.072
That'll be $2.99.

14:11.074 --> 14:13.775
Really? It's soaking wet.

14:13.777 --> 14:15.977
Fine, a dollar.

14:19.181 --> 14:20.314
Can you break a 20?

14:20.316 --> 14:22.383
No, I only have hundreds.

14:23.852 --> 14:25.653
You know what?

14:25.655 --> 14:28.189
I don't always recognize
sarcasm, but I do right now,

14:28.191 --> 14:30.358
and I don't appreciate it.

14:30.360 --> 14:31.793
I'm sorry for your loss.

14:31.795 --> 14:34.562
But you're not the only one
whose day has been a disaster.

14:41.970 --> 14:44.872
That could have killed me.

14:44.874 --> 14:48.109
I can't catch a break.

14:50.379 --> 14:51.946
I haven't heard
from Sheldon in a while.

14:51.948 --> 14:53.147
You think he's okay?

14:53.149 --> 14:54.482
Oh, I'm sure he's fine.

14:54.484 --> 14:56.417
I'm gonna see where he is.

14:56.419 --> 14:58.519
How?

14:58.521 --> 15:00.922
Oh, I know his password,
so I can track his phone.

15:00.924 --> 15:02.523
You do that?

15:02.525 --> 15:05.493
Not always, but ever since he
wandered off at the swap meet

15:05.495 --> 15:08.830
chasing a balloon,
I get worried.

15:08.832 --> 15:10.331
He can take care of himself.

15:10.333 --> 15:11.799
Look, we went over
stranger danger

15:11.801 --> 15:14.335
and gave him that whistle.

15:14.337 --> 15:16.470
That's weird.

15:16.472 --> 15:19.040
What?
He's at the train station.

15:19.042 --> 15:20.608
So? He loves trains.

15:20.610 --> 15:22.610
It's dark out and he's
alone, I don't like it.

15:22.612 --> 15:23.845
Let's go get him.

15:23.847 --> 15:26.013
Oh, it's sweet how you
look out for him.

15:26.015 --> 15:27.181
You're a good guy.

15:27.183 --> 15:28.449
It's not just that.

15:28.451 --> 15:31.152
My mother would kill me if I let
something happen to him.

15:35.390 --> 15:38.459
Dude, I'm so sorry.

15:38.461 --> 15:39.760
Don't take this
the wrong way,

15:39.762 --> 15:42.530
but did you do this
for the insurance money?

15:42.532 --> 15:45.867
No. God, you sound like
the police, the firemen,

15:45.869 --> 15:48.970
my parents, my therapist
and the insurance company.

15:50.372 --> 15:52.607
We're here for you, man.
Whatever you need, okay?

15:52.609 --> 15:53.908
Uh, actually, I was
wondering if I could

15:53.910 --> 15:55.610
crash at your place
for a few nights.

15:55.612 --> 15:57.044
Sure, of course.

15:57.046 --> 15:58.779
Oh, actually, Emily was
gonna spend the night.

15:58.781 --> 16:01.716
You slept with her? Nice.

16:01.718 --> 16:03.484
Well, I can't take
all the credit.

16:03.486 --> 16:05.653
She let me do it
to her, but...

16:06.922 --> 16:10.191
Uh, but I can always
call her and cancel.

16:10.193 --> 16:12.627
Hang on. I know
a place you can stay

16:12.629 --> 16:14.795
and earn some money
at the same time.

16:14.797 --> 16:16.898
Great.
I just have to warn you,

16:16.900 --> 16:21.068
it'll involve humiliation,
degradation and verbal abuse.

16:22.037 --> 16:24.438
So what's the catch?

16:30.012 --> 16:32.179
Sheldon.

16:32.181 --> 16:34.015
You tracked my phone?

16:34.017 --> 16:35.349
Yeah.

16:35.351 --> 16:39.353
Boy, you chase one balloon
for three miles.

16:41.356 --> 16:43.424
We were worried
about you.

16:43.426 --> 16:45.459
Don't be melodramatic.

16:45.461 --> 16:48.763
I'm just getting on a train
and leaving forever.

16:48.765 --> 16:50.765
Seriously?

16:50.767 --> 16:52.166
You don't even have
a change of clothes

16:52.168 --> 16:53.534
or a toothbrush.

16:53.536 --> 16:56.504
My plan is to stop at malls
and buy what I need.

16:56.506 --> 16:58.673
It's called
living off the land.

16:58.675 --> 17:01.042
Okay, I know you're upset

17:01.044 --> 17:03.010
and there's a lot
of stuff going on,

17:03.012 --> 17:04.645
but it's nothing
we can't work out.

17:04.646 --> 17:06.113
Come on, let's get you home.

17:06.115 --> 17:08.148
No. I've reached
my breaking point.

17:08.151 --> 17:10.117
I need to leave. Now.

17:10.118 --> 17:11.519
And go where?

17:11.521 --> 17:12.887
It doesn't matter.

17:12.888 --> 17:16.123
So a few things
don't go your way

17:16.125 --> 17:20.261
and your best decision is to
ride the rails like a hobo?

17:21.863 --> 17:23.798
I suppose it is.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.866
Except I have a credit card.

17:25.867 --> 17:29.337
And I refuse to carry
my laptop at the end of a stick.

17:31.239 --> 17:35.142
And I'd sooner die
than eat beans out of a can.

17:35.144 --> 17:37.611
Come on, come home with us

17:37.613 --> 17:39.347
and tomorrow I'll-I'll
take you to Legoland.

17:39.349 --> 17:42.350
Legoland is not
the solution to everything.

17:43.151 --> 17:44.552
And it's too much of a scene

17:44.554 --> 17:46.754
since that movie came out.

17:47.756 --> 17:49.790
Then what can I do?

17:49.792 --> 17:52.126
Leonard, I am overwhelmed.

17:52.128 --> 17:55.896
Everything is changing
and it's simply too much.

17:55.898 --> 17:57.498
I need to get away and think.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.433
Oh, c-come on, you know
you're overreacting.

17:59.435 --> 18:00.935
Leonard, hang on.

18:00.937 --> 18:04.105
Just... come here
for a second.

18:05.807 --> 18:07.341
Maybe we need to let him go.

18:07.343 --> 18:09.143
What?! Why?

18:09.145 --> 18:10.411
It might be good for him.

18:10.413 --> 18:11.345
Y-You know he can't

18:11.347 --> 18:13.347
take a trip like this
by himself.

18:13.349 --> 18:14.648
He's a grown man.

18:14.650 --> 18:17.218
No, he <i>looks</i> like a grown man.

18:18.887 --> 18:20.554
You've seen
<i>Freaky Friday,</i> sometimes

18:20.556 --> 18:23.657
little kids end up
in big person bodies.

18:24.726 --> 18:26.761
Leonard, we can't
protect him forever.

18:26.763 --> 18:28.262
I know, but...

18:28.264 --> 18:29.830
He'll be okay.

18:29.832 --> 18:31.198
You taught him
well, Padawan.

18:31.200 --> 18:32.900
Good Lord!

18:32.902 --> 18:36.637
Padawan's the student,
not the teacher.

18:38.206 --> 18:40.207
Seriously, let him go.

18:45.347 --> 18:47.648
Sheldon, if you really
need to do this,

18:47.650 --> 18:49.183
I'm not gonna
stand in your way.

18:49.185 --> 18:51.552
I do.

18:51.554 --> 18:54.255
Okay.

18:54.257 --> 18:55.856
Good luck.

18:59.895 --> 19:02.897
Be safe and call us.

19:05.067 --> 19:06.534
I will.

19:07.836 --> 19:10.004
Bye, buddy.

19:14.209 --> 19:15.443
Sheldon...

19:15.445 --> 19:17.511
Yes?

19:17.513 --> 19:20.181
I'm gonna miss you.

19:21.416 --> 19:23.717
Of course you are.

19:25.754 --> 19:28.689
He just made that easier.
Mm.

19:39.287 --> 19:41.453
Hey!

19:43.056 --> 19:45.324
What are you guys
still doing here?

19:45.326 --> 19:46.992
I got this, go. Go home.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.729
You sure?

19:51.765 --> 19:53.232
Yeah, she's fed,
she took her pills,

19:53.234 --> 19:54.634
she's all tucked in
and watching TV.

19:54.635 --> 19:56.869
So, she's not
too much for you?

19:56.871 --> 19:59.805
Are you kidding?
I love her, she's great.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.374
Stewie, you gonna watch

20:02.376 --> 20:04.043
<i>Wheel of Fortune</i> with me?

20:04.045 --> 20:06.312
Coming, Debbie.

20:07.781 --> 20:09.415
You call her Debbie?

20:09.417 --> 20:10.849
She insisted.

20:10.851 --> 20:13.485
So, hey, guys,
thank you so much.

20:13.487 --> 20:15.688
This job is a dream come true.

20:22.128 --> 20:24.196
Was that a little weird?

20:24.198 --> 20:26.065
Yeah. I don't know why,

20:26.067 --> 20:28.901
but something
about it feels...

20:28.903 --> 20:32.838
unnatural.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.975
Okay, let's go.
Yep.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.645
Okay, Sheldon,
thanks for checking in.

20:39.647 --> 20:41.580
Talk to you tomorrow?

20:41.582 --> 20:44.283
O-Okay, bye.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.818
He's okay?

20:45.820 --> 20:47.820
Actually sounds like
he's doing pretty well.

20:47.822 --> 20:50.322
I really think
this is gonna be for the best.

20:50.324 --> 20:51.757
Me, too.

20:51.759 --> 20:53.792
And he was able
to take a sabbatical from...

20:53.794 --> 20:55.698
How could you let him go?!
