Stewie, what are
you doing?

00:40.941 --> 00:42.508
Oh, just doing a
little tai chi.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.943
You know how the Asians
look 30 until they're 60?

00:44.945 --> 00:46.011
This is why.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.946
Of course, then they
suddenly look 100,

00:47.948 --> 00:49.014
but cross that
bridge, you know?

00:49.016 --> 00:50.182
Is this a Japanese thing?

00:50.184 --> 00:51.517
No, Chinese.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.252
The Japanese have a whole
other thing going on.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.620
Hey, you want
to see a movie?

00:54.622 --> 00:55.788
Nah, we're Japanese;

00:55.790 --> 00:57.489
let's go watch
a schoolgirl bang an octopus.

00:57.491 --> 00:58.490
BOTH:
Yeah!

00:58.492 --> 01:00.793
(speaking Japanese)

01:00.795 --> 01:02.961
Suction cup feel good!

01:02.963 --> 01:06.131
(octopus and girl giggling)

01:06.133 --> 01:08.667
And of course the most
important part of any workout

01:08.669 --> 01:11.136
is a proper cool
down and a stretch.

01:11.138 --> 01:12.137
(screams)

01:12.139 --> 01:13.138
What? What is it?

01:13.140 --> 01:14.973
I got a splinter!

01:14.975 --> 01:17.042
(crying)

01:19.179 --> 01:20.946
Oh, my God, Stewie, what is it?!

01:20.948 --> 01:22.347
Oh, he's just
got a splinter.

01:22.349 --> 01:23.849
Oh, my poor baby.

01:23.851 --> 01:26.118
It's 'cause these old stairs
are just falling apart.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.419
It's not just the stairs.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.855
Meg has spent two days
pinned under a roof beam.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.792
Let's just focus
on the stairs, Brian.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.530
Morning, Opie.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.532
Hey, what's going on?
You going somewhere?

01:40.534 --> 01:42.167
(babbling)

01:42.169 --> 01:43.936
You got fired? Why?!

01:43.938 --> 01:45.971
(babbling)

01:45.973 --> 01:47.272
Oh, well, it's no wonder

01:47.274 --> 01:48.941
they finally caught you
doing that in here.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.542
I mean, the underside
of your desk

01:50.544 --> 01:52.144
looks like Carlsbad Caverns.

01:52.146 --> 01:53.846
(babbling)

01:54.948 --> 01:57.749
Griffin, say hello
to Opie's replacement, Stella.

01:57.751 --> 01:59.118
Nice to meet you.

01:59.120 --> 02:01.920
We doing a new
secret handshake now?

02:01.922 --> 02:03.822
No, Griffin, she's deaf.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.691
Oh. Can she
read lips?

02:05.693 --> 02:06.959
Yes, I can.

02:06.961 --> 02:10.162
So if I do this, I can talk
about what a sweet rack she has?

02:10.164 --> 02:12.965
Yes, but try not to make
a boob-honking gesture

02:12.967 --> 02:14.633
with your other hand
while you're saying it.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.168
Sorry.
It's okay.

02:16.170 --> 02:17.669
I'm used to people being

02:17.671 --> 02:20.372
a little uncomfortable
with me at first.

02:20.374 --> 02:23.375
If you have any questions,
feel free to ask.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.843
Yeah, actually, I do.

02:24.845 --> 02:28.113
Are your other senses better
on account of you can't hear?

02:28.115 --> 02:30.782
Like, can you smell my farts
before they even come out?

02:30.784 --> 02:32.684
'Cause I got one
in the pocket right now,

02:32.686 --> 02:35.487
and I want to know if I need
to feel self-conscious about it.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.256
I can't smell it, no.

02:37.258 --> 02:39.358
I might be able
to see it, though.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.095
A lot of people make small
movements when they fart.

02:43.097 --> 02:45.364
They twitch their
eye or something.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.366
Oh, like subtle
giveaways, huh?

02:47.368 --> 02:50.669
All right, well, t-tell me
if you can see when it happens.

02:50.671 --> 02:51.970
(farts)

02:51.972 --> 02:53.005
You just farted.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.373
Oh, my God,
you saw that?!

02:54.375 --> 02:57.109
You can see all my tiny,
subtle movements?

02:57.111 --> 02:58.277
(farts)

02:58.279 --> 02:59.845
You just did it again.

02:59.847 --> 03:01.480
Well, this is
gonna be a delight!

03:01.482 --> 03:03.048
I don't know
why Lois always said

03:03.050 --> 03:05.017
she had problems
with female coworkers.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.853
So Abby, Elaine and Janet have
their little lunch clique,

03:07.855 --> 03:09.021
and of course
I'm not invited.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.289
Seems like
you're doing everything

03:10.291 --> 03:11.590
and they're doing nothing.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.358
Well, I don't know,
but what I do know is

03:13.360 --> 03:14.960
that in the
staff meeting,
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.328
Christina said my inventory
system wasn't feasible.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.763
She's obviously
threatened by you.

03:17.765 --> 03:19.631
But when the associate sales
manager came back in the room...

03:19.633 --> 03:20.866
It's ridiculous,
and I support you fully.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.334
...she told him the idea
as if it was hers...

03:22.336 --> 03:23.468
You can't let them
get to you.

03:23.470 --> 03:25.003
They're jealous
of what you have.

03:25.005 --> 03:27.005
It's nothing to do with you,
and everything to do with them.

03:27.007 --> 03:29.074
Only you can
prevent forest fires.

03:32.312 --> 03:34.980
Hey, Peter, you ready
to go to the Clam?

03:34.982 --> 03:36.582
(quietly):
Whoa, who's the hot chick?

03:36.584 --> 03:37.816
Oh, that's Stella.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.017
You don't have to whisper;
she's deaf.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.018
Really?

03:40.020 --> 03:41.286
Oh, my God, that's hot.

03:41.288 --> 03:43.088
I didn't know you had
a thing for deaf chicks.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.289
Any kind of disabled
chick, Peter.

03:44.291 --> 03:45.691
They can do
things to you

03:45.693 --> 03:47.326
that regular chicks
don't even think of.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.660
Besides, you know me.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.329
I'm into a lot of
different stuff.

03:54.033 --> 03:55.667
What, did you hear something?

03:55.669 --> 03:56.768
No, it's all good.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.936
All right.

04:05.011 --> 04:07.613
You know, Chris,
a little friendly advice.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.181
Uh, you're gonna
start dating soon;

04:09.183 --> 04:10.983
probably good
to get in the habit

04:10.985 --> 04:12.417
of chewing
with your mouth closed.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.087
Doesn't bother me, I'm just--
you know, one friend to another.

04:15.089 --> 04:16.922
Oh, what, you got
a problem with me?

04:16.924 --> 04:19.491
You think I'm gross?

04:19.493 --> 04:22.561
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

04:24.530 --> 04:28.166
Yeah. This is what you are
and this is what I am.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.002
Peter, hurry up!

04:30.004 --> 04:31.036
You're missing dinner.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.140
(grunting, screaming)

04:35.142 --> 04:38.877
(bleeping)

04:38.879 --> 04:40.279
Lois, what the hell?!

04:40.281 --> 04:42.014
Oh, my God, Peter,
are you okay?!

04:42.016 --> 04:43.448
What the hell happened
to the stairs?!

04:43.450 --> 04:44.583
They're all
slippery now!

04:44.585 --> 04:46.184
I had them replaced,
remember?

04:46.186 --> 04:48.920
The old ones were so rough,
and Stewie got that splinter,

04:48.922 --> 04:51.490
so I thought replacing
the wood was the best way to go.

04:51.492 --> 04:52.958
When'd you do that?!

04:52.960 --> 04:55.294
The other day, when you spent
all that time at the drugstore.

04:55.296 --> 04:56.595
Oh, yeah.

04:56.597 --> 04:57.929
Couldn't figure out
if that Hispanic lady

04:57.931 --> 04:58.997
worked there or not.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.770
Um... excuse me.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.508
Excuse me.

05:09.510 --> 05:13.011
Boy, I wonder where the
shampoos are around here.

05:14.514 --> 05:18.583
I said, "I wonder where the
shampoos are around here."

05:20.486 --> 05:22.020
Oh, for God's sake,
I almost thought

05:22.022 --> 05:22.954
you were a
regular person.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.289
Where's the shampoo?!

05:24.291 --> 05:27.292
(rock music playing inside)

05:27.294 --> 05:29.461
What the hell?

05:29.463 --> 05:32.364
(people chattering)

05:34.334 --> 05:36.468
Hey, guys,
all the action's over here!

05:36.470 --> 05:39.104
Quagmire, what
is all this?

05:39.106 --> 05:41.039
Peter's new coworker
gave me an idea.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.442
Welcome to
Disabled Ladies Night.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.043
Mine are made
from teak.

05:45.045 --> 05:49.314
Yeah, mine are actually just
pressboard with wood veneer.

05:49.316 --> 05:50.816
I can't get wet.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.919
Oh. I think I
see my friends.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.757
Hey, uh, you guys
enjoy the carnival.

05:58.759 --> 06:01.593
I'm gonna get
a drink at the bar.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.662
Hey, uh, anyone
sitting here?

06:03.664 --> 06:04.930
No, go ahead.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.098
Thanks.

06:06.100 --> 06:08.100
Hey, would you like
to go out sometime?

06:08.102 --> 06:09.501
Wow, that was fast.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.703
Yeah, well, you know, I read
somewhere that women decide

06:11.705 --> 06:14.005
within the first seven seconds
if they're interested in you

06:14.007 --> 06:16.007
or not, so I figured I
wouldn't waste anybody's time.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.008
Fair enough.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.310
Sure, let's go out.

06:18.312 --> 06:19.478
Really?
Yeah.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.380
Like you said,
I've already decided.

06:21.382 --> 06:22.381
I'm Kate.

06:22.383 --> 06:23.582
I'm Brian.

06:23.584 --> 06:25.517
Hey, uh, you want
to go outside?

06:25.519 --> 06:26.685
Maybe a little
quieter.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.186
Sure.

06:32.425 --> 06:34.025
Oh, my God, I...

06:34.027 --> 06:36.094
Hey, check out Brian
with the blind chick.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.129
Hey, don't worry, Brian,

06:37.131 --> 06:38.797
you're still doing
better than Quagmire.

06:38.799 --> 06:39.998
He got a hooker.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.700
Ha!

06:41.702 --> 06:43.368
No, no, but she is
a prostitute.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.647
Listen, you know, we can do
something else if you want.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.082
Why? I'm having a good time.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.417
Well, I mean, I
just don't know

06:58.419 --> 07:01.420
how much fun it is for a blind
person to go to the movies.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.955
Brian, blind people
go to the movies all the time.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.290
We just listen.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.926
I might be blind, but my brain
has been trained to listen

07:07.928 --> 07:11.363
to any movie and know exactly
what's happening on screen.

07:11.365 --> 07:13.432
Like, I loved <i>Titanic.</i>

07:13.434 --> 07:16.034
I'm the king of the world!

07:16.036 --> 07:17.669
(orchestral music playing)

07:17.671 --> 07:21.006
(whooping)

07:24.510 --> 07:26.978
So you sure you don't
need me to come in?

07:26.980 --> 07:29.047
Maybe show you
to your bed.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.283
Pretty sure I can
find it, thanks.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.118
Maybe next time I'll
have trouble, though.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.253
You might have to help
me find it next time.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.855
So there's a next time.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.789
Definitely.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.790
Great.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.126
Well, all right, good night.

07:41.128 --> 07:42.461
(dog barking)

07:42.463 --> 07:45.197
Ugh! Our stupid
neighbor's dog barks 24/7.

07:45.199 --> 07:47.032
God, I hate dogs.

07:47.034 --> 07:48.333
Y-You do?

07:48.335 --> 07:52.137
Yeah, they're just slobbery,
annoying, needy little bastards.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.439
I'm just not really a
dog person, I guess.

07:54.441 --> 07:56.842
Oh. Uh, yeah, me neither.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.610
Dog people can get
pretty annoying.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.712
Wow, this is
a nice apartment you have.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.147
Is this your dog?

08:02.149 --> 08:05.250
Yes. Isn't he the cutest
little cutie wutie?

08:05.252 --> 08:06.918
Look how cute he is.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.119
Yes, he's very cute.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.521
Yes, he's cute.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.523
Yes, he's cute,
cute, cute, cute.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.492
Look at him. Look
at him. Look at him.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.659
(chuckles):
Okay.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.862
Look at it! Look at
that face! Come on!

08:16.864 --> 08:18.630
Look at that face!
You look at him!

08:18.632 --> 08:20.398
Look at that
(bleep) face!

08:22.034 --> 08:24.769
PETER:
Hey, guys, this is
driving me nuts.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.705
Was one of the dwarves
named Snappy?

08:26.707 --> 08:27.973
Kind of well dressed?

08:27.975 --> 08:29.474
Or am I-I just making that up?

08:29.476 --> 08:31.109
(grunting, screaming)

08:31.111 --> 08:34.513
(bleeping)

08:34.515 --> 08:35.981
Oh, my God, Dad!

08:35.983 --> 08:37.082
Dad, are you okay?!

08:37.084 --> 08:39.017
Damn it, I hate
these new stairs!

08:39.019 --> 08:39.985
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:39.987 --> 08:41.253
I'll just--
I'm-I'm just gonna

08:41.255 --> 08:43.121
lie here until the
pain goes away.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.656
What are you
guys watching?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.958
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to
the first time travel movie

08:46.960 --> 08:48.994
with a perfectly functioning
time machine.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.529
All right, if I'm correct,

08:50.531 --> 08:53.265
this should land us
in six million B.C.

08:55.201 --> 08:57.002
Quick!
Get us out of here!

08:58.938 --> 09:00.171
Boy, that was close.

09:00.173 --> 09:01.806
Oh, my God,
where's Frank?!

09:01.808 --> 09:03.141
I'm over here.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.376
Oh, okay.

09:10.616 --> 09:13.018
Brian, if I ever
take up roller derby,

09:13.020 --> 09:14.619
what do you think
my name should be?

09:14.621 --> 09:17.989
Bruisin' B. Anthony,
Alicia Sleaze or Quahag?

09:17.991 --> 09:19.591
How about Harlot O'Scara?

09:19.593 --> 09:21.126
Aw, you dick,
that's genius.

09:21.128 --> 09:22.093
How'd your date go?

09:22.095 --> 09:24.129
Aw, went great.
We had an awesome time.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.797
She's really smart,
really funny.

09:25.799 --> 09:26.932
Cute?
Yeah, hot, actually.

09:26.934 --> 09:28.500
I don't know
how she does it,

09:28.502 --> 09:30.435
but she dresses really well
for a blind girl.

09:30.437 --> 09:32.103
I mean, like,
her body is just...

09:32.105 --> 09:34.873
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.874
What?

09:35.876 --> 09:36.875
Don't "what" me.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.043
You just said
she's blind.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.210
You just said it.

09:39.212 --> 09:40.779
You totally
buried the lead.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.180
Yeah, well, it's not
that important.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.682
So what if she can't see?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.350
She's amazing
in every other way.

09:45.352 --> 09:47.118
Okay, if you say so.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.588
Hey, does she have really
weird, messed-up eyes?

09:49.590 --> 09:50.956
No, her eyes are normal.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.358
They're beautiful, actually.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.993
Bet they're not.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.996
Bet they look like
bowls of milk.
Shut up.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.464
You sure she isn't
just using you?

09:59.466 --> 10:00.699
Seeing-eye dogs are expensive;

10:00.701 --> 10:03.101
she may just be trying
to get one for free.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.970
No, actually, she doesn't
want a seeing-eye dog.

10:04.972 --> 10:07.272
She hates dogs.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.440
What?

10:08.442 --> 10:09.608
She doesn't like dogs.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.109
She's just not a dog person.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.944
What? Does she not
know you're a dog?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.145
How is that possible?

10:14.147 --> 10:16.681
Well, we-we haven't
done anything yet.

10:16.683 --> 10:18.917
So I'm-I'm just gonna, I'm just
gonna avoid touching her

10:18.919 --> 10:20.485
until a little more time
has passed.

10:20.487 --> 10:23.121
And by the time I tell her,
I'll have impressed her so much

10:23.123 --> 10:24.689
that the dog thing
won't even matter.

10:24.691 --> 10:26.091
Yeah, well, good
luck with that.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.126
You know, I like
your delusion, Brian.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.662
Most people would say,
"I lost, I give up,"

10:30.664 --> 10:32.631
but you, you just
keep trying.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.366
You're like the
Dominican Republic.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.468
Always killing the guy
in charge and saying,

10:36.470 --> 10:39.504
"Oh, this new guy, this new
guy's gonna get it right."

10:39.506 --> 10:41.106
Well, that's just because
I have confidence

10:41.108 --> 10:42.374
that I'll find happiness.

10:42.376 --> 10:43.975
Hey, anything's
possible, right?

10:43.977 --> 10:45.644
I mean, I once
found the Batcave.

10:45.646 --> 10:48.146
Look, you can't expect
to hire 60 workers

10:48.148 --> 10:51.116
to dig a cave under your house
and then keep it a secret.

10:51.118 --> 10:52.851
I mean, those men
live in this town.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.520
Yeah, but I told them it was
part of a geological survey.

10:55.522 --> 10:56.988
Batman, Batman.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.458
They built a lazy Susan
for your nuclear car.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.761
That's something they consider
conversation-worthy.

11:06.599 --> 11:09.034
Gosh, this has been
an amazing week, Brian.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.802
I still can't believe
you beat up

11:10.804 --> 11:12.170
that guy
who tried to mug us.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.605
That was a great dinner.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.473
Yeah, I really liked that
salmon you recommended.

11:15.475 --> 11:17.042
Yes. May I help
you gentlemen?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.943
(disguised voice):
"Hey, you're in a
tough part of town.

11:18.945 --> 11:20.445
Now, give me your
purse, doll face."

11:20.447 --> 11:21.846
Hey, you get your
hands off that!

11:21.848 --> 11:23.148
I don't care how many
of you there are--

11:23.150 --> 11:24.516
you're not taking
this purse!

11:24.518 --> 11:26.284
"Ah, the hell we aren't.
Let's get him, boys!"

11:26.286 --> 11:27.919
Brian?
Stay right there, Kate.

11:27.921 --> 11:29.120
I'll handle this.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.522
(grunting)

11:30.524 --> 11:32.157
Yeah, you like
that, huh?

11:32.159 --> 11:33.491
"Ooh! This
guy's tough!"

11:33.493 --> 11:34.759
(grunting)

11:34.761 --> 11:36.027
"No fair. He
knows karate.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.663
Usually, handsome guys ain't
so good with their fists."

11:38.665 --> 11:39.931
(grunting)

11:39.933 --> 11:41.800
And stay away from
my girlfriend.

11:41.802 --> 11:42.967
Brian, I know
karate, too.

11:42.969 --> 11:44.169
I can help you.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.770
"You stay out
of this, lady!"

11:45.772 --> 11:47.272
(groaning)

11:47.274 --> 11:49.607
I got one!
I think I got one!

11:49.609 --> 11:51.710
Yeah, yeah, but I-I
got the other four.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.178
They're-they're
gone now.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.446
They're gone.

11:54.448 --> 11:56.247
Well, they took the
gift I had for you,

11:56.249 --> 11:57.515
but at least
you're okay.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.284
And that trip
to the Eiffel Tower

11:59.286 --> 12:01.019
was just amazing.

12:02.788 --> 12:03.922
(panting)

12:03.924 --> 12:05.857
Are we almost
at the top?

12:05.859 --> 12:07.759
Yeah, just a
few more steps.

12:07.761 --> 12:09.661
Here we are.

12:09.663 --> 12:11.963
Ah, the winds of Paris.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.498
Isn't that what they say?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.633
Oh, that breeze
is gorgeous.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.002
And I think I smell...
croissants?

12:18.004 --> 12:19.304
Do you?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.172
You have an amazing
sense of smell.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.373
Oh, there it is.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.775
There's what?
Oh, nothing.

12:23.777 --> 12:25.009
Just the, uh,
Goodyear blimp.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.679
It says, "I love you,
Kate," all in lights.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.314
(gasps)
Here in Paris?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.850
Yeah, it's... it's here for
Wimbledon or something.

12:31.852 --> 12:32.951
Oh, my God.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.119
That's the most
romantic thing

12:34.121 --> 12:35.653
anybody's ever
done for me.

12:35.655 --> 12:36.955
Well, get used to it.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.523
You're going to be
hearing a lot of things

12:38.525 --> 12:39.124
I've done for you.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.996
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>True Blood.</i>

12:44.998 --> 12:46.865
Hi. I'm a nude vampire.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.000
Hi. I'm a nude werewolf.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.635
And that's the show!

12:50.637 --> 12:52.036
Peter, come downstairs.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.772
That gay show you like is on.

12:53.774 --> 12:55.006
PETER:
Coming!

13:10.456 --> 13:13.024
(screaming)

13:13.026 --> 13:15.426
(repeated bleeping)

13:15.428 --> 13:16.828
Damn it!

13:16.830 --> 13:18.463
Oh, my God, Peter.
Are you okay?

13:18.465 --> 13:19.964
No, I am not okay!

13:19.966 --> 13:21.933
Nothing about this
is okay!

13:21.935 --> 13:23.768
You just need
to be more careful

13:23.770 --> 13:25.103
coming down the stairs.
That's all.

13:25.105 --> 13:27.038
(grunts)
Easy for you to say.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.207
This is stressing
the crap out of me.

13:29.209 --> 13:32.043
Like when we had that
easily startled wallpaper.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.513
(voices screaming)
Aah!

13:42.655 --> 13:43.922
Well, it's getting late.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.123
I should probably go.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.525
Brian, this is like
our sixth date.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.993
I'm beginning to feel
like you're not

13:48.995 --> 13:50.328
attracted to me
or something.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.996
No, I... Oh,
my God, I'm...

13:51.998 --> 13:53.631
I'm so attracted
to you. I...

13:53.633 --> 13:56.301
So why haven't we
done anything about it?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.002
I-I just... you
know, sometimes

13:58.004 --> 13:59.804
taking things
slower is better.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.506
Just ask any sloth.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.176
MALE VOICE:
<i>Hey, is sometimes</i>
<i>taking things slower better?</i>

14:10.916 --> 14:12.650
Yeah.

14:12.652 --> 14:16.020
I just... I like
you a lot, and I...

14:16.022 --> 14:17.422
I don't want to
ruin anything

14:17.424 --> 14:18.857
by moving too
fast, you know?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.192
'Cause sometimes,
when you...

14:23.028 --> 14:25.630
Brian, you never told me
you had a beard.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.931
I love beards.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.266
Oh. Yeah.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.602
No, hey, I'm bearding
it up over here.

14:30.604 --> 14:34.439
Hey, Brian, would you be cool
with meeting my parents?

14:34.441 --> 14:35.840
They're in town
this weekend,

14:35.842 --> 14:37.375
and I thought we
could all have dinner.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.977
Uh... sure.

14:38.979 --> 14:42.113
Are they... are they
driving themselves?

14:42.115 --> 14:45.583
If you're asking
if they can see, yes.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.919
And since you can see...

14:47.921 --> 14:50.755
why don't you tell me
how these look?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.690
Uh... they look
pretty damn great.

14:52.692 --> 14:55.126
Then why don't you
tell me how they feel?

14:55.128 --> 14:56.361
Uh, next time.

14:56.363 --> 14:58.363
Some things are
worth waiting for.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.965
Wow. You're really
a true gentleman.

15:00.967 --> 15:02.500
Yep, not too
many of us left.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.002
(coughing over
shutter clicking)

15:11.010 --> 15:12.043
Stewie,
I need your help.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.111
What? What is it?

15:13.113 --> 15:14.345
I have a crisis situation here.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.947
Kate wants me
to meet her parents.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.949
Hey, guys.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.352
Just gonna...
gonna take this.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.621
Thank you.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.156
What the hell
am I going to do?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.658
All right, all right,
just calm down.

15:26.660 --> 15:28.126
Calm down?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.661
We're all supposed to have
dinner tomorrow night,

15:29.663 --> 15:31.996
and her parents
are going to see that I'm a dog.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.865
(screaming
and groaning)

15:33.867 --> 15:37.001
(repeated bleeping)

15:37.003 --> 15:38.136
Don't worry, Brian.

15:38.138 --> 15:39.437
I'll come up
with something.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.939
Remember, I'm the
guy who came up

15:40.941 --> 15:42.774
with the choreography
to <i>Showgirls.</i>

15:42.776 --> 15:45.109
♪

15:45.111 --> 15:47.111
Okay, stop.
Stop. Stop.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.580
Elizabeth, darling,
too much hands, not enough hips.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.015
Can I just show you?

15:52.451 --> 15:54.519
One, two, three, four.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.788
I'm dancing from my vagina.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.489
One, two, three, four.

15:58.491 --> 16:00.458
I'm grinding, I'm grinding.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.660
Orgasm eyes, orgasm eyes.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.862
And we're done.

16:04.864 --> 16:08.499
You do 20% that,
and we got a movie.

16:12.471 --> 16:14.639
Peter, what
is all this?

16:14.641 --> 16:15.773
Oh, hi, Lois.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.008
I live upstairs now.

16:17.010 --> 16:18.142
What?
That's right.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.944
I made a nest
of my old underwears

16:19.946 --> 16:21.546
on which
to lay my eggs,

16:21.548 --> 16:24.082
and I shall raise my young
in this room alone.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.183
Peter, you're being an idiot.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.284
Oh, really?

16:26.286 --> 16:27.585
Would an idiot
have been able

16:27.587 --> 16:29.187
to rig this rig
to that rig?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.089
Peter, that's nothing.

16:31.091 --> 16:33.191
Oh, is it?

16:36.695 --> 16:39.263
I died! I died!

16:47.973 --> 16:50.174
Oh, hi.
You must be Kate.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.509
I'm Brian's nurse.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.144
He's had a little accident,
I'm afraid.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.113
Oh, my God, Brian!
Are you okay?

16:55.115 --> 16:56.414
Ah, don't worry.
I'm fine.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.282
I'm just sort of
bandaged up right now.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.751
You must be Kate's parents.

16:59.753 --> 17:00.985
It's so nice
to meet you.

17:00.987 --> 17:02.854
Well, it's lovely
to meet you, too.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.322
So what happened?

17:04.324 --> 17:07.025
What happened is this one's
a hero, is what happened.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.193
Rescued two children
from a burning building.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.695
Can you imagine?

17:10.697 --> 17:12.864
Not quite in time-- they
were both horribly burned.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.465
Have that sort of
crème brûlée face

17:14.467 --> 17:16.267
going on now, but he
saved their lives.

17:16.269 --> 17:17.535
Oh, my God, Brian.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.203
I know, right?
So noble.

17:19.205 --> 17:21.172
Plus he's the only
one of my patients

17:21.174 --> 17:23.441
to never ask me
for hand work.

17:23.443 --> 17:25.043
Such a gentleman.

17:25.045 --> 17:26.177
Never even
tried anything

17:26.179 --> 17:28.112
when I'm giving
him a sponge bath.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.113
And I'm very
thorough.

17:29.115 --> 17:30.815
I will wash the
abdominals.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.316
Not all nurses
do, but I do.

17:32.318 --> 17:33.751
And yes, sometimes
I graze it,

17:33.753 --> 17:34.786
but you know what?

17:34.788 --> 17:35.920
I'm a healthcare
professional.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.321
It's what I do.
It's my work.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.489
It's important
to me,

17:38.491 --> 17:40.258
and this one
respects that.

17:40.260 --> 17:43.294
And I'm very
grateful.

17:43.296 --> 17:45.063
Why are you here again?

17:46.365 --> 17:48.166
Oh, my God!
I am so, so sorry.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.034
Uh, it's no problem.
Don't worry about it.

17:50.036 --> 17:51.135
(sniffing)

17:51.137 --> 17:52.603
What's that smell?

17:52.605 --> 17:54.705
It smells like
wet dog in here.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.943
That is the... the
smell of backed up,

17:58.945 --> 18:01.045
unreleased
genital essence.

18:01.047 --> 18:03.948
As I said, he's been
an amazing gentleman.

18:03.950 --> 18:06.084
Well, I'd like
to propose a toast.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.919
To Brian and Kate.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.821
I know we just met,
but you seem

18:09.823 --> 18:11.489
like you're really good
for our daughter.

18:11.491 --> 18:13.091
And risking your
life for those kids?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.525
You're a good
guy, Brian.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.260
A really good guy.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.728
Wow. Thanks.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.298
(rapid thumping)

18:20.300 --> 18:22.100
What's that
thumping noise?

18:22.102 --> 18:23.801
(softly): It's your tail.
Stop wagging your tail.

18:23.803 --> 18:25.570
I can't help it.
Do something.

18:26.505 --> 18:28.539
(groans)

18:28.541 --> 18:30.108
(groaning):
Oh... oh, damn it.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.976
I meant hold it,
not cut it off.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.044
You weren't specific.

18:33.046 --> 18:34.112
I've never done
this before.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.480
Are you okay, Brian?

18:35.482 --> 18:38.049
Yeah, I'm just so happy
to meet you both.

18:38.984 --> 18:40.118
(sizzling)

18:40.120 --> 18:41.752
What the hell
are you...

18:41.754 --> 18:44.088
I'm cauterizing your tail.
Trust me, I'm a nurse.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.089
(stifled groaning)

18:45.091 --> 18:46.090
Brian?

18:46.092 --> 18:47.291
What's going on
over there?

18:47.293 --> 18:49.460
(sniffs) I think
they burned our dinner.

18:49.462 --> 18:50.962
Oh, God, it hurts.
It hurts, Stewie.

18:50.964 --> 18:52.497
Here's a little
morphine.

18:52.499 --> 18:55.099
What the hell? You're not
gonna stick me with that thing.

18:55.101 --> 18:56.801
KATE'S DAD:
I don't think
that's a real nurse.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.302
Just hold still.
Pretend you're at the vet.

18:58.304 --> 18:59.704
Vet?
I hate the vet!

18:59.706 --> 19:01.005
(barking angrily)

19:01.007 --> 19:02.940
There's a dog
in here!

19:04.443 --> 19:06.110
Yes! Okay?

19:06.112 --> 19:08.346
There's a dog in here.
I'm a dog!

19:08.348 --> 19:09.780
(gasping)

19:13.685 --> 19:15.286
I'm so sorry, Kate.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.121
I-I know you hate
dogs, and I...

19:17.123 --> 19:19.957
I wanted to tell you--
I-I really did--

19:19.959 --> 19:21.592
but I-I just thought...

19:21.594 --> 19:24.028
I thought, if we got to know
each other better first,

19:24.030 --> 19:26.097
you would eventually
be able to see past it.

19:26.099 --> 19:29.133
And I... I just... I
really care about you,

19:29.135 --> 19:30.968
and I really want this
to work, and I'm...

19:30.970 --> 19:32.937
I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you before.

19:32.939 --> 19:35.173
Can you ever forgive me?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.508
Do you think that you
can still be with me?

19:37.510 --> 19:39.810
(sighs)
You know what, Brian?

19:39.812 --> 19:41.913
I could have gotten over
the fact that you're a dog,

19:41.915 --> 19:43.814
because I really do
care about you

19:43.816 --> 19:45.449
and I feel like we had
a connection,

19:45.451 --> 19:48.019
but I can't get over the fact
that you lied to me.

19:48.021 --> 19:49.020
You screwed up, Brian.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.922
And now you're
going to have to watch me

19:50.924 --> 19:52.657
walk out that door.

20:00.799 --> 20:03.167
(alarm blaring)

20:03.169 --> 20:04.702
(horn honking, man screaming)

20:04.704 --> 20:05.970
(tires screeching)

20:05.972 --> 20:07.305
(crashing)

20:07.307 --> 20:10.441
Well, it sounds
like I'm needed outside.

20:15.180 --> 20:16.981
Mom, what were
all those carpenters

20:16.983 --> 20:18.082
doing here today?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.984
Putting back our old
crappy stairs, Meg.

20:19.986 --> 20:21.619
I didn't have a choice.

20:21.621 --> 20:23.287
Yay! I love my old stairs!

20:23.289 --> 20:25.256
(giggling)

20:25.258 --> 20:28.025
Uh-oh,
I forgot to cut Joe down.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.528
Joe, what are you
doing up there?

20:30.530 --> 20:32.263
Enjoying Heaven, Bonnie.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.864
Come join me.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.234
There's a gun in
my nightstand.

20:38.770 --> 20:40.104
Brian, I know
you're upset

20:40.106 --> 20:41.439
about what happened with
Kate and everything,

20:41.441 --> 20:43.140
but I did have
one more thought.

20:43.142 --> 20:44.308
Yeah, what's that?

20:44.310 --> 20:45.610
Well, since Kate is blind,

20:45.612 --> 20:47.211
you could probably just
do a different voice

20:47.213 --> 20:49.180
and go out with her
all over again.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.483
BRIAN (nasally):
Hey. Are you Kate?
Yes.

20:52.485 --> 20:54.485
Hey, it's Noah
from JDate.
Oh, my God! Hi!
