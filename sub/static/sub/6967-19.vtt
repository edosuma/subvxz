02:54.007 --> 02:57.966
I'm not a killer.
And I never meant to hurt no one.

02:58.077 --> 03:02.878
But I'm tired of my cattle being butchered
a hundred miles from the slaughterhouse.

03:02.949 --> 03:05.008
That's the fourth one this month.

03:05.118 --> 03:10.579
- Who or what do you think was responsible?
- That cow was like a shredded piece of paper.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.953
No animal could have done that.

03:13.026 --> 03:17.224
Then are you saying that a person,
or persons, was responsible for this?

03:17.330 --> 03:21.528
I want to remind you that
Mr Parker is free on bond, pending trial.

03:21.601 --> 03:25.230
He's speaking with you
solely in regards to this incident

03:25.338 --> 03:27.932
and not about any other pending litigation.

03:28.007 --> 03:32.205
So we can't talk about his court case
against the Trego Indian Reservation?

03:32.312 --> 03:34.007
That's exactly what I mean.

03:34.113 --> 03:36.547
- Wait a damn second!
- Jim, don't say a word.

03:36.649 --> 03:39.982
Forget that lawyer crap.
I wanna get this out in the open!

03:40.053 --> 03:42.021
You think I killed an Indian

03:42.121 --> 03:47.787
- just because we're arguing about land!
- We wanna settle that peacefully, in court.

03:47.860 --> 03:51.921
Well, Joseph Goodensnake is dead
with a wound from your shotgun.

03:53.466 --> 03:56.924
All I'm saying,
it was no kind of animal that I know of.

03:57.937 --> 04:00.132
It damn well didn't seem human neither!

04:00.206 --> 04:02.265
Take a look at my boy's scars.

04:05.778 --> 04:07.405
It was dark.

04:07.480 --> 04:10.381
We heard a growl.
We went out to protect the cattle.

04:10.450 --> 04:12.543
I could've swore I saw

04:13.286 --> 04:15.379
red eyes and fangs.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.450
I thought my boy Lyle was...

04:22.462 --> 04:24.953
Look, nobody, nobody

04:25.031 --> 04:29.832
was more shocked and upset than I was
to find out it was that young Indian boy.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.836
But if he killed our cattle,

04:31.904 --> 04:35.704
I'm very, very sorry that
we had to find out about it that way.

04:35.808 --> 04:38.436
But as far as I'm concerned,
that's the end of it!

04:39.912 --> 04:43.075
- Can we see the corral?
- I'll take you out there.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.182
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah?

04:49.255 --> 04:50.916
Agent Scully?

04:51.024 --> 04:54.187
I suppose if I were hearin'
our side of the story,

04:54.260 --> 04:56.524
it might not hold up too well.

04:57.397 --> 05:03.063
Parts of it I don't understand myself, things
my father could never explain to a stranger.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.502
What kinds of things?

05:06.439 --> 05:10.637
For the last few months, whenever we'd
go out at night and check on the cattle,

05:10.743 --> 05:14.873
we never saw anything out of the ordinary -
not a mountain lion, not a coyote.

05:14.947 --> 05:18.041
Not even any Tregos, Agent Scully.

05:20.753 --> 05:22.880
But I could feel it,

05:22.955 --> 05:25.048
something not human...

05:25.858 --> 05:28.019
out there,

05:28.094 --> 05:30.153
watching me.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.129
The air was more still

05:34.233 --> 05:36.531
and the night animals more quiet.

05:37.303 --> 05:40.363
It was like nature herself was terrified.

05:41.307 --> 05:43.775
It gave me the creeps.

05:43.876 --> 05:45.104
The creeps?

05:45.178 --> 05:46.975
Yeah.

05:47.080 --> 05:50.481
The creeps. Don't you ever get the creeps?

06:00.493 --> 06:02.552
The victim was shot there.

06:03.329 --> 06:06.196
About three meters from where Parker fired.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.128
There's no way he could have
mistaken a person for an animal.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.297
It's open and shut, Mulder.

06:14.907 --> 06:18.934
You know, I'm surprised
you volunteered for this assignment.

06:19.679 --> 06:23.274
Any Bureau agent could have
investigated this homicide.

06:23.349 --> 06:25.340
Why are you interested?

06:51.310 --> 06:55.041
Well, there seems to be nothing
unexplainable about this case.

06:55.148 --> 06:56.843
Nope.

06:56.949 --> 06:59.008
Not a thing.

07:04.123 --> 07:08.184
Mulder, this is so odd.
It's almost like a snakeskin that's been shed.

07:08.261 --> 07:14.359
I suspect the Parkers killed Goodensnake, but
they don't seem the type to skin their victim.

07:14.801 --> 07:18.396
Besides which, police and coroner's report
make no mention of it.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.964
We're going to have to
take a look at the body ourselves.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.010
The body's with the reservation authorities.

07:25.077 --> 07:27.409
We're supposed to get in touch with

07:27.480 --> 07:29.573
Sheriff Charlie Tskany.

08:11.324 --> 08:15.385
Excuse me, we're not from around here.
We're looking for Sheriff Tskany.

08:23.069 --> 08:25.799
Anyone know Charlie Tskany?

08:26.706 --> 08:29.266
Go home, FBI.

08:31.143 --> 08:33.441
How'd you know?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.913
I could smell you a mile away.

08:36.015 --> 08:41.214
They told me that even though my deodorant
is for a woman, it's strong enough for a man.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.322
I was at Wounded Knee in 1973.

08:50.897 --> 08:53.491
And what I learned fighting the FBI is

08:53.566 --> 08:57.468
you don't believe in us...
and we don't believe in you.

08:58.571 --> 09:00.664
I want to believe.

09:02.508 --> 09:06.171
Why are you here? What are you looking for?

09:06.279 --> 09:08.577
You already know what we're looking for.

09:08.681 --> 09:12.139
- You tell me what I know.
- We're looking for any individuals

09:12.251 --> 09:14.947
who have information on the homicide of...

09:15.054 --> 09:18.785
We're looking for anything
that can create human tracks in one step

09:18.891 --> 09:21.155
and animal tracks in the next.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.161
Parker...

09:24.263 --> 09:26.788
He found what you're looking for.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.925
He killed what you're looking for, FBI.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.930
What Parker and his kid killed
was my brother!

09:33.005 --> 09:37.374
And you're all too afraid of some stupid
Indian legend to do anything! I hate it!

09:37.476 --> 09:38.966
Gwen!

09:39.078 --> 09:42.946
I hate suits who are here when they
want something, but if we need help

09:43.716 --> 09:45.809
they're nowhere to be found.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.084
Sheriff Tskany?

09:55.328 --> 09:58.627
I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.531
Goodensnake's body is in my office.

10:22.054 --> 10:23.351
Bill, Tom,

10:24.824 --> 10:26.155
let 'em through.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.519
Come on, boys, let 'em through.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.572
- Who are they?
- Guardians of the dead.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.939
They escort the deceased spirits
to the new world.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.535
I only let them as far as the front door.

10:47.613 --> 10:51.481
I keep the ancient beliefs out there
and the police work in here.

10:51.584 --> 10:55.680
The woman in the pool hall said that
people were afraid of some Indian legend.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.154
What do they believe about the Parker case?

10:58.891 --> 11:02.088
I'm not a park ranger here
to answer all your questions about Indians.

11:02.194 --> 11:05.220
Whenever I need federal help, I never get it!

11:06.165 --> 11:11.501
Since this case falls under the jurisdiction of
the FBI, you're entitled to examine the body.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.630
So let's get it over with.

11:19.879 --> 11:23.042
- Was the woman in the pool hall his sister?
- Gwen.

11:23.115 --> 11:28.018
She and Joe were primarily responsible for
fueling the boundary dispute with Parker.

11:28.087 --> 11:32.456
They felt that he'd been grazing his cattle
too far onto the reservation.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.790
Parker probably told you
he wanted to settle in court,

11:35.895 --> 11:38.056
but Joe and Gwen filed the suit.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.059
Take a look at that scar tissue.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.466
Yeah.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.028
Looks like an animal attack as well.

11:47.106 --> 11:49.472
Could Joe have been attacked?

11:50.509 --> 11:53.945
- Maybe the Parkers did see an animal.
- No.

11:54.046 --> 11:57.447
Those wounds have been healing
for quite some time.

11:57.516 --> 12:00.883
The shotgun wound
indicates point-blank range.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.922
The pellets entered the body in a single mass.

12:04.023 --> 12:07.823
The assailant couldn't have been
more than three feet away.

12:07.927 --> 12:11.021
We need to take a look at
Joe Goodensnake's dental records.

12:26.545 --> 12:29.275
These are the canine cuspids. They're normal.

12:29.348 --> 12:32.181
Maybe his records
were switched or misplaced.

12:32.284 --> 12:36.050
The second incisor is chipped,
just like the ones in his mouth.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.181
These match Joe Goodensnake's.

12:38.290 --> 12:43.455
There are cases of calcium phosphate salts
developing abnormally with age, but...

12:43.529 --> 12:48.159
That could account for what Jim Parker
claims to have seen. He was out that night

12:48.267 --> 12:53.933
expecting to see a mountain lion. He gets
rattled and the flashlight catches Joe here.

12:54.006 --> 12:56.600
So Parker saw what he wanted to see -
an animal.

12:56.709 --> 13:01.078
Lyle was attacked. He has scars just like Joe.
Is there a facility where we can

13:01.147 --> 13:03.206
- perform an autopsy?
- Why?

13:03.315 --> 13:08.776
If Joe's teeth are abnormal, an autopsy might
reveal abnormalities in his internal anatomy.

13:10.122 --> 13:12.750
I can't allow that.

13:22.768 --> 13:25.999
- I'm fully qualified.
- No, I can't let you do an autopsy.

13:26.105 --> 13:30.201
- The funeral is tonight.
- It's a cremation. Then we'll have nothing.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.939
The Tregos believe that the recent dead are
unsettled by their new condition as spirits.

13:35.014 --> 13:39.781
Any desecration of the body angers the spirit
and keeps it haunting this world.

13:39.852 --> 13:42.980
But as a law enforcement officer,
you can't destroy evidence.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.421
Don't tell me what I can't do.

13:45.524 --> 13:50.052
Native Americans believe there are laws
greater than that of the US Government.

13:50.763 --> 13:55.200
If they want Joe at rest, rather than used as
a piece of evidence, that's how it's gonna be.

13:56.202 --> 14:00.468
If you want to make an issue out of it
to your higher authority, go right ahead.

14:01.140 --> 14:02.767
Charlie?

14:03.676 --> 14:07.578
Do you believe that the spirit of
Joe Goodensnake is in that room?

14:11.951 --> 14:14.010
All I know is

14:14.086 --> 14:16.179
tomorrow, the day after,

14:16.255 --> 14:18.382
you're gonna leave.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.791
But I have to stay here.

14:20.860 --> 14:23.158
I've gotta answer to these people.

14:24.230 --> 14:28.997
You can continue your investigation,
but without Joe Goodensnake's body.

14:57.696 --> 14:59.789
Mulder, since we've been here

14:59.865 --> 15:04.234
you've acted as if you've expected to find
all the evidence that we've come across.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.103
What aren't you telling me?

15:08.140 --> 15:09.198
Why are we here?

15:12.077 --> 15:14.136
A true piece of history, Scully.

15:16.849 --> 15:22.685
The very first X-File.
Initiated by J Edgar Hoover himself in 1946.

15:25.224 --> 15:30.890
In World War II, a series of murders occurred
in the Northwest, seven here in Browning.

15:31.697 --> 15:36.066
Each victim was basically ripped to shreds
and eaten as if by a wild animal.

15:36.735 --> 15:41.866
However, many of the victims were found at
home, as if they allowed their killer to enter.

15:43.742 --> 15:48.907
In 1946, police cornered what they
believed to be such an animal in a cabin

15:49.048 --> 15:51.312
in Glacier National Park.

15:51.383 --> 15:53.146
They shot it.

15:53.252 --> 15:58.349
But when they went in to retrieve the carcass,
they found only the body of Richard Watkins.

15:59.258 --> 16:02.750
- Sounds like the Parker scenario.
- The murders stopped that year.

16:03.462 --> 16:06.295
Because the cases were unsolved
and considered so bizarre,

16:06.365 --> 16:10.199
Hoover locked them away,
hoping that they would be forgotten.

16:10.903 --> 16:15.135
This file indicates that
they started again in 1954.

16:15.207 --> 16:18.472
And '59, '64, '78,

16:18.544 --> 16:20.774
and now again in '94.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.814
- But...
- Here it comes.

16:23.916 --> 16:28.376
These animal-man related murders
predate the oldest X-File by 150 years.

16:28.487 --> 16:32.389
Members of the Lewis and Clark expedition
wrote of Indian men

16:32.491 --> 16:34.584
who could change into a wolf.

16:36.996 --> 16:41.194
Mulder, what this... what this folder describes
is called lycanthropy.

16:41.300 --> 16:43.734
It's a type of insanity in which

16:43.802 --> 16:47.329
an individual believes
that he can turn into a wolf.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.899
I mean, no one

16:50.009 --> 16:52.603
can physically change into an animal!

17:02.121 --> 17:05.852
What about the evidence?
Tracks in the mud, the shredded skin,

17:05.958 --> 17:09.450
- a man with the teeth of an animal.
- Even if you're right

17:09.560 --> 17:15.157
and Joe Goodensnake did have the ability
to transform physically into an animal,

17:15.233 --> 17:18.601
he's dead! Jim Parker shot him

17:18.670 --> 17:21.638
and in a couple of moments
his body will be burned.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.470
End of mystery.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.171
Let's hope so.

17:47.866 --> 17:49.959
You don't belong here.

17:50.803 --> 17:54.239
- Gwen...
- You're only around to wrap up your case.

17:57.609 --> 18:01.101
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry about your brother.

18:01.847 --> 18:05.112
I feel sad for anyone
who loses a part of their family.

18:05.217 --> 18:07.378
A part?

18:07.453 --> 18:09.512
He was my whole family.

18:11.223 --> 18:13.282
I'm it now.

18:16.328 --> 18:18.489
As a demonstration of sorrow

18:19.531 --> 18:23.126
I'm supposed to give away
all my brother's possessions.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.199
Gwen, I don't know what to say.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.402
It's no big deal.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.743
He had more possessions
than he had friends.

19:01.940 --> 19:06.877
I read the report of your investigation into
the Goodensnake homicide. It was very good.

19:06.945 --> 19:09.072
It was thorough, professional.

19:10.282 --> 19:12.773
But what I want to know is off the record.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.516
What do you think really happened?

19:17.322 --> 19:21.088
Your explanation, Agent Mulder,
is lying on that burial platform.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.856
Why don't you just accept that and go home?

19:26.665 --> 19:30.123
Charlie, do you believe in shape-shifting?

19:30.202 --> 19:32.295
This is a funeral.

21:32.924 --> 21:35.893
- Get out of here!
- Please, I want to show my respects.

21:35.994 --> 21:40.294
I don't want your respects!
I want your heart to grow cold.

21:40.399 --> 21:42.629
I want you to feel what I'm feeling!

21:46.605 --> 21:49.597
I think you'd better leave, Mr Parker.

21:52.711 --> 21:57.239
I wish your brother could be here.
I wish that more than anything else.

24:16.054 --> 24:20.423
The body's been mutilated. I'd say
he's been attacked by a large predator.

24:20.492 --> 24:22.983
Or somebody wanted it to look that way.

24:23.061 --> 24:26.258
Do you think this is retaliation
for Joe Goodensnake?

24:27.466 --> 24:28.831
I don't know.

24:30.635 --> 24:33.798
Have you talked to Gwen Goodensnake?
She seemed pretty upset last night.

24:34.639 --> 24:38.803
She's gone. Nobody's seen her since
the funeral. I've put an APB out on her.

24:40.011 --> 24:42.070
And what about Lyle Parker?

24:42.214 --> 24:44.910
We can't find him either.

24:45.016 --> 24:47.075
He could be dead as well.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.247
I'll take a look around.

26:17.342 --> 26:20.573
That's not from any animal I've ever seen.

26:20.679 --> 26:23.477
Sheriff, I think it's time we had a talk.

26:25.750 --> 26:27.809
An exchange of ideas?

26:27.919 --> 26:29.784
Mulder!

26:34.726 --> 26:37.524
Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital.

26:42.801 --> 26:47.534
He's suffering from exposure. When he's
been checked out, I'm going to question him.

26:58.516 --> 26:59.813
What are you hiding?

27:00.919 --> 27:02.978
- I thought it was over.
- Over?

27:03.054 --> 27:07.115
Is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy
on Joe Goodensnake's body?

27:07.926 --> 27:09.985
You thought it would all end
when he was cremated?

27:10.962 --> 27:12.452
What were you afraid we'd find?

27:12.564 --> 27:14.794
I can't tell you,

27:14.866 --> 27:17.664
but I'll take you to somebody who can.

27:34.986 --> 27:37.648
I'm ashamed to say it
after what happened at the funeral.

27:39.257 --> 27:42.988
I picked up some bourbon
and I don't remember a thing after that.

27:47.599 --> 27:52.696
When I'm down, I go out to where we keep
stray animals that wander in on the ranch.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.600
I just watch 'em, you know.
It keeps things in perspective.

27:59.444 --> 28:01.071
Anyway,

28:02.080 --> 28:07.484
my mom, when she was alive, was the one
that started keeping those animals.

28:07.585 --> 28:10.452
I guess I go out there and think about her too.

28:12.857 --> 28:16.816
God, I must have been really wasted
to run around there naked.

28:17.429 --> 28:20.398
I must have thought
I was one of those animals.

28:23.401 --> 28:27.633
When you did go home,
did you talk to your father?

28:28.840 --> 28:31.741
No, he'd have been mad
I even went to the funeral.

28:33.111 --> 28:34.135
I...

28:34.245 --> 28:36.338
I have an image of him...

28:38.049 --> 28:40.483
sitting on the front porch, but

28:40.552 --> 28:42.952
I don't remember talking to him. Why?

28:45.356 --> 28:47.449
Your father's dead.

28:52.363 --> 28:54.456
I'm sorry.

29:01.372 --> 29:03.465
It appears as if he's been...

29:04.776 --> 29:06.869
attacked by an animal, but...

29:07.846 --> 29:10.246
I suspect it may be homicide.

29:10.915 --> 29:15.318
Lyle... I lost my father recently
and I know how overwhelming...

29:15.386 --> 29:17.479
Was it my fault?

29:21.392 --> 29:25.590
By going to the funeral,
did it anger them into killing my father?

29:27.499 --> 29:29.160
I don't know.

29:32.704 --> 29:38.199
I can deal with death, you know. Livin'
on the ranch, being close to nature and all,

29:38.877 --> 29:44.611
you see how it all works. Things are born,
things die. Everything else falls in-between.

29:49.220 --> 29:51.347
But if I caused it...

29:52.557 --> 29:54.616
If I brought it on...

29:55.527 --> 29:57.586
I couldn't... I...

30:14.546 --> 30:16.810
I saw it once with my own eyes.

30:19.017 --> 30:21.110
It was a long time ago.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.245
It seemed like a dream.

30:23.955 --> 30:26.014
I was a boy.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.850
Was that 1946?

30:28.960 --> 30:31.019
The Watkins case?

30:32.263 --> 30:34.390
I sense you are different, FBI.

30:34.465 --> 30:39.061
You're more open to Native American belief
than some Native Americans.

30:42.941 --> 30:45.273
You even have an Indian name.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.401
Fox.

30:47.478 --> 30:51.209
You should be "Running Fox"
or "Sneaky Fox".

30:52.584 --> 30:54.984
Just as long as it's not "Spooky Fox".

30:55.954 --> 30:59.390
Now tell me, Ish, what did you see?

31:02.961 --> 31:05.657
Watkins had been attacked by an animal

31:07.232 --> 31:09.393
when he was alone in the woods.

31:11.469 --> 31:14.233
His scars healed. It was forgotten.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.704
Then... the murders began.

31:19.010 --> 31:20.170
The Tregos...

31:21.112 --> 31:26.516
we realized that Watkins had been attacked
by what the Algonquians call

31:26.618 --> 31:28.677
the manitou.

31:30.455 --> 31:34.983
An evil spirit capable of
changing a man into a beast.

31:36.794 --> 31:41.629
To be attacked by a manitou
causes the victim to become one.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.826
The healed scars
on Joe Goodensnake's body.

31:45.904 --> 31:48.896
The manitou overtakes a man by night,

31:49.007 --> 31:51.441
not by full moon,

31:51.509 --> 31:55.468
but when its blood lust
builds to uncontrollable level,

31:55.546 --> 31:58.310
the man changes to a sickening creature.

31:59.217 --> 32:03.244
It kills, releasing the savage energy.

32:04.889 --> 32:07.824
The man returns to his true self,

32:07.892 --> 32:10.622
unaware of what has happened.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.726
The cycle begins anew the next day.

32:16.234 --> 32:18.293
This continues until death.

32:19.737 --> 32:21.432
One night,

32:22.507 --> 32:24.839
when I was 16 years old,

32:25.176 --> 32:28.873
I was coming back from fishing
at the Cut Bank Creek.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.575
I knew a shortcut behind Watkins' house.

32:33.651 --> 32:35.915
There was a... a groan...

32:37.388 --> 32:39.083
not animal,

32:39.157 --> 32:41.250
but not human.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.519
I looked into his window.

32:45.730 --> 32:47.891
He was covered in sweat and blood.

32:50.335 --> 32:52.462
He was in a great,

32:52.537 --> 32:54.596
great pain.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.502
His arm, the skin ripped...

33:02.714 --> 33:04.944
it tore off and fell to the floor.

33:06.017 --> 33:08.349
Claws sprang from his fingernails.

33:09.320 --> 33:11.413
He turned, screaming...

33:13.424 --> 33:15.517
and he saw me.

33:15.593 --> 33:17.618
His eyes...

33:18.496 --> 33:21.158
His eyes were still human.

33:21.232 --> 33:23.325
They begged me to kill him.

33:24.535 --> 33:29.529
If I had been hunting and had my gun,
I'd have done it without a second thought.

33:30.241 --> 33:32.505
But being a boy...

33:33.411 --> 33:35.971
and scared to death,

33:36.047 --> 33:38.572
I ran away.

33:38.649 --> 33:41.117
Shortly after, the police killed him.

33:41.185 --> 33:43.449
But the manitou rose again.

33:44.756 --> 33:47.452
Eight years later.

33:47.558 --> 33:51.858
But with Watkins dead, how could there
have been an attack by a manitou?

33:53.131 --> 33:55.190
Watkins had a son.

33:56.667 --> 33:59.067
It can be passed along bloodlines.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.762
Gwen!

34:03.474 --> 34:05.567
If Joe Goodensnake was this creature,

34:05.643 --> 34:09.010
perhaps it didn't originate in him
by the first attack,

34:09.080 --> 34:11.674
but was handed down
through the bloodlines.

34:11.783 --> 34:14.809
Gwen could have it also.
Gwen could have killed Parker.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.103
Gwen!

34:41.179 --> 34:42.668
Hey!

34:46.684 --> 34:48.777
No! No! No!

34:51.222 --> 34:54.385
You're under arrest, Gwen,
for stealing Ish's car!

34:56.194 --> 34:58.628
What are you running away from?

34:59.397 --> 35:00.921
I saw it!

35:01.032 --> 35:03.626
I... I saw it kill Parker.

35:04.602 --> 35:06.229
Let her up.

35:11.876 --> 35:14.401
I went there... after the funeral.

35:15.079 --> 35:17.138
I was gonna mess up the kid,

35:17.248 --> 35:19.546
so I waited,

35:19.650 --> 35:22.118
but Parker was on the porch.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.247
And then this thing,

35:25.323 --> 35:28.224
this animal... Oh, my God!

35:29.327 --> 35:32.319
I've never been so scared.

35:32.463 --> 35:34.829
I ran and I hid in the woods all day!

35:35.900 --> 35:39.131
I wanted to get out!
I wanted to get outta here!

35:39.770 --> 35:42.568
I wanted to get outta here!

35:42.673 --> 35:44.300
Bring her inside.

35:58.122 --> 35:59.521
Thank you.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.683
Hello, this is Dr Joseph.

36:01.759 --> 36:06.526
This is Agent Mulder, FBI. I was told
I could reach Agent Scully at this number.

36:06.597 --> 36:11.000
Oh, yes. We released Lyle Parker
and she's taking him back to the ranch.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.730
- I can reach her there?
- They just left.

36:15.339 --> 36:18.103
Agent Mulder,
there's something you should know.

36:18.176 --> 36:22.340
I received the blood test performed on Lyle.
Something's rather unsettling.

36:22.413 --> 36:23.710
What's that?

36:23.781 --> 36:28.184
Traces of his father's blood type.
It can only be there through ingestion.

37:13.598 --> 37:16.362
- The power's out.
- It happens to us all the time

37:16.434 --> 37:20.234
being out here in the sticks.
I'll fire up the generator.

37:23.774 --> 37:25.833
Are you OK?

37:25.943 --> 37:28.969
I feel sick. Please, help me into the bathroom.

37:41.559 --> 37:44.960
Damn! It keeps disconnecting.
The mountains must be blocking the signal.

37:45.029 --> 37:47.589
- How much farther?
- About seven miles.

37:52.570 --> 37:55.232
Lyle? Let me come in.

37:58.309 --> 38:00.709
Lyle, I want to take you
back to the hospital, OK?

38:00.811 --> 38:02.608
No!

38:02.680 --> 38:04.773
I'll be all right.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.521
Lyle?

38:16.627 --> 38:18.026
Lyle, answer me.

38:19.130 --> 38:21.223
Lyle, are you all right?

40:17.448 --> 40:18.938
Scully!

41:23.414 --> 41:26.076
It's OK, it's me. It's me. OK.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.778
I don't know what happened.
Something jumped me downstairs.

41:28.853 --> 41:31.321
- I lost my gun.
- I heard it come up here.

41:31.989 --> 41:34.048
- Come on.
- OK.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.924
Are you all right?

42:55.406 --> 42:56.771
Oh, my God!

42:58.008 --> 43:00.101
He was in the bathroom, sick.

43:00.177 --> 43:03.544
The next thing I knew
we were attacked by the mountain lion.

43:03.681 --> 43:07.981
- It wasn't the mountain lion.
- It's still in the cage out back.

43:28.806 --> 43:32.640
Where's Gwen?
She said she'd come see us before we left.

43:32.743 --> 43:36.975
She left last night. Gave away
all her possessions to her friends.

43:37.047 --> 43:39.914
She just pulled up and left?
Why would she do that?

43:39.984 --> 43:44.546
Her brother's gone, no family,
the trouble with Parker is all over.

43:46.156 --> 43:49.319
Maybe she saw something
that she wasn't ready to understand.

43:51.996 --> 43:53.327
Maybe.

43:58.035 --> 44:00.128
Well, thank you.

44:10.214 --> 44:11.875
FBI!

44:14.051 --> 44:18.044
See you in about... eight years.

44:18.989 --> 44:20.479
I hope not.
