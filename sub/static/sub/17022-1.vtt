VIVIAN: I read this somewhere,
and it stuck with me ever since.

01:30.435 --> 01:32.571
It's the first sentence
of a really thick book...

01:32.603 --> 01:33.805
that was assigned reading...

01:33.837 --> 01:36.309
for the advanced placement
English class at my school.

01:36.340 --> 01:38.777
I wasn't in the class.
I'm not advanced.

01:38.809 --> 01:42.080
My body, on the other hand...
that's a different story.

01:42.113 --> 01:43.446
SALESLADY:
Bit of a tomboy, isn't she?

01:43.478 --> 01:45.515
MURRAY: Any suggestions?
It's her first one.

01:45.547 --> 01:48.887
SALESLADY: First? She needs
more than a training bra.

01:48.918 --> 01:50.688
MURRAY: It happened,
I tell you, overnight.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.122
She got stacked
just like her mother.

01:53.154 --> 01:54.289
VIVIAN: God.

01:54.322 --> 01:56.860
SALESLADY:
She wants with the underwire?

01:56.891 --> 01:59.863
VIVIAN: Just a normal one
that doesn't point.

01:59.894 --> 02:02.999
SALESLADY: I'll need to measure her.
We need to find out her cup size.

02:03.030 --> 02:04.831
MURRAY: Right, OK.
I'll take a walk.

02:04.863 --> 02:06.933
SALESLADY:
You'll need to lift your arms.

02:06.966 --> 02:08.668
That a girl.

02:08.701 --> 02:12.840
Usually girls come in here
much younger... for their first bra

02:12.872 --> 02:14.773
when they're developed like you are.

02:14.806 --> 02:18.211
VIVIAN: I've been hiding them.
SALESLADY: Can't go on hiding them forever.

02:18.242 --> 02:19.678
You can't stop nature.

02:19.711 --> 02:24.017
VIVIAN: My brother stares.
SALESLADY: Is that your grandfather?

02:24.048 --> 02:26.882
VIVIAN: Father.
SALESLADY: Ah.

02:32.189 --> 02:35.226
SALESLADY: There you go.
Now how does that feel?

02:35.256 --> 02:36.692
VIVIAN: It's pointy.

02:36.725 --> 02:38.795
SALESLADY:
You've gotta put yourself in it.

02:38.827 --> 02:42.801
Bend over, lift the breast,
then drop it back into the cup.

02:42.831 --> 02:43.966
Like this?

02:43.998 --> 02:46.266
That's right.
Now do the other one.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.205
And stand up straight.

02:49.236 --> 02:50.471
Nice.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.807
Doesn't that feel secure?

02:52.839 --> 02:54.542
You're a perfect "C."

02:55.673 --> 02:59.079
VIVIAN: Look at me.
I'm, like, deformed.

02:59.111 --> 03:01.348
What are you talking?
You're healthy.

03:01.380 --> 03:04.486
Some girls have one breast
one size and one another.

03:04.516 --> 03:06.283
Have to get them custom made.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.153
Specialty stores.
That's expensive.

03:08.184 --> 03:10.455
You've been blessed.

03:10.487 --> 03:12.390
Breasts are wonderful.

04:27.420 --> 04:29.321
Come on. We're moving.

04:29.353 --> 04:33.092
VIVIAN: Again? We just got here.
MURRAY: Pack your bag.

04:33.124 --> 04:34.392
VIVIAN: What time is it?

04:34.425 --> 04:37.430
MURRAY: Let's go, let's go.
Your brothers are up already.

04:37.462 --> 04:40.032
Here. Put your stuff in here.

04:40.062 --> 04:43.101
What are you doing? Not that.
Pack the important stuff.

04:43.132 --> 04:44.869
Pack good stuff.
Pack your clothes.

04:44.900 --> 04:46.803
Come on.
We gotta get out of here.

04:46.836 --> 04:47.971
VIVIAN: What's going on?

04:48.003 --> 04:50.773
MURRAY: I found a better place.
I'll tell you in the car.

04:50.804 --> 04:53.809

another night in this shithole.

05:11.289 --> 05:14.528
- We're going on vacation.
- What about this month's rent?

05:14.558 --> 05:17.096
MURRAY: Going to Disneyland
to ride the Matterhorn.

05:17.128 --> 05:19.765
WOMAN:
You come back here, you bum!

05:20.332 --> 05:23.269
WOMAN: I knew you were a flake
when you moved in here!

06:43.135 --> 06:44.536
I'm sick of moving.

06:44.569 --> 06:46.706
Why can't we ever stay put?

06:46.736 --> 06:49.541
It's not normal
to move every three months.

06:49.574 --> 06:51.210
BEN: It's normal
in some cultures.

06:51.242 --> 06:53.446
Nomads, they move.

06:53.477 --> 06:55.545
It's stupid, Ben.
We're not nomads.

06:55.578 --> 06:56.948
We're Americans.

06:56.979 --> 06:59.984

this time?

It's just too early to show up.

07:03.319 --> 07:05.220
We wanna make a good impression.

07:05.252 --> 07:07.189
We want to show up

out of someplace.

MURRAY: We made a choice.
We moved like people.

07:20.170 --> 07:23.175
That place was a shithole.
Highway robbery.

07:23.207 --> 07:24.442
VIVIAN: Fine.

07:24.475 --> 07:26.611
A lot of famous people
live on this street.

07:31.514 --> 07:32.682
VIVIAN: Does not. Who says?

07:32.714 --> 07:35.651
A friend of mine from Beverly,
this rich kid. He told me.

07:35.682 --> 07:37.519
Why would he live here?
It's not so great.

07:37.551 --> 07:39.154

07:50.062 --> 07:51.999
Why would Lucy live in that?

07:52.030 --> 07:55.637
BEN: She's supposed to be
really old and mean now.

07:55.667 --> 07:58.904
And on Halloween, her butler
stands in front of the gates...

07:58.935 --> 08:00.405
and he says
to the little kids...

08:00.438 --> 08:04.814
"Miss Ball is issuing no treats
this year."

08:04.842 --> 08:06.810

off the upholstery.

to tell you? It's a demo.

09:23.741 --> 09:25.711
You want service?
It's an expression for service.

09:25.743 --> 09:27.847
BEN: You can't say it.
It's racist.

09:27.879 --> 09:30.515

I'm tying to get his attention.

09:30.547 --> 09:32.450

from the track.

Maybe she'll look for you.

01:19:15.651 --> 01:19:17.154
You're learning about wrists?

01:19:18.989 --> 01:19:21.126
RITA: Pulse. How to take
someone's pulse.

01:19:21.158 --> 01:19:22.660
That's great, honey.

01:19:22.692 --> 01:19:23.993
isn't that something, Mick?

01:19:26.161 --> 01:19:28.398
- Take my pulse.
- What?

01:19:28.429 --> 01:19:29.799
Come on, take my pulse.

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:32.135
I want to see what my little
girl's learning over there.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:33.570
She doesn't have a watch.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:35.002
You need a watch to do it.

01:19:35.034 --> 01:19:36.971
Here. Take mine.

01:19:37.003 --> 01:19:38.439
RITA: Dad.

01:19:38.471 --> 01:19:41.109
Cartier. That's an excellent
timepiece, Uncle Mickey.

01:19:41.141 --> 01:19:42.109
It's excellent.

01:19:42.142 --> 01:19:43.844
Take my pulse.
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:19:43.876 --> 01:19:46.279
OK. You ready?

01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:49.884
Ready? Shouldn't I be
pulsing automatically?

01:19:51.315 --> 01:19:52.751
What the hell are you doing?

01:19:52.784 --> 01:19:53.986
I'm looking, Dad.

01:19:54.019 --> 01:19:56.422
You have to look that hard,
I can't be doing too good.

01:19:56.453 --> 01:20:00.794
Is there a doctor in the house?
We got a dead man in this booth.

01:20:02.959 --> 01:20:04.662
Dead.

01:20:04.694 --> 01:20:05.927
Get one off once in a while.

01:20:05.961 --> 01:20:07.096
BEN: Good one.

01:20:07.129 --> 01:20:08.932
Yeah, you're a riot, Uncle Mickey.

01:20:08.964 --> 01:20:11.467
Come on, let me--
[VIVIAN COUGHING]

01:20:11.499 --> 01:20:13.837
BELLE:
Oh, honey, are you all right?

01:20:13.869 --> 01:20:15.037
Oh, Viv.

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:17.905
BELLE:
This girl needs some water.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:19.941
Somebody get some water!

01:20:19.973 --> 01:20:22.043
MURRAY: Can we get water?
Can't you see the kid's choking?

01:20:23.977 --> 01:20:25.112
MICKEY: What is that?

01:20:25.146 --> 01:20:27.948
Must've swallowed a hairball
from all that hair in her face.

01:20:27.979 --> 01:20:29.282
BELLE:
Shh. Stop it.

01:20:31.984 --> 01:20:34.221
WAITRESS:
Can I take your order?

01:20:35.721 --> 01:20:37.555
MICKEY: Yeah, yeah,
we'll order something.

01:20:39.156 --> 01:20:40.626
OK.

01:20:46.928 --> 01:20:49.266
Uh, can we get the check?

01:20:49.299 --> 01:20:51.836
BELLE: And I'd like
a little more water, please.

01:20:51.867 --> 01:20:53.804
It was very salty.

01:20:53.835 --> 01:20:55.805
MICKEY: So how's
the new apartment working out?

01:20:55.837 --> 01:20:58.106
Oh, it's beautiful.
You gotta come see it.

01:20:58.139 --> 01:21:00.644
It's really nice, Uncle Mickey.
We love it.

01:21:00.675 --> 01:21:03.814
Mickey, you didn't forget the monthly?

01:21:03.844 --> 01:21:05.914
I already sent you for this month.

01:21:05.946 --> 01:21:08.516
What are you doing,
blowing my money at the track?

01:21:08.547 --> 01:21:10.149
No. That was for last month.

01:21:10.182 --> 01:21:11.451
Tomorrow's the first again.

01:21:11.483 --> 01:21:14.956
How many times I gotta tell you?
You gotta learn to budget.

01:21:14.987 --> 01:21:16.390
You're a 65-year-old man.

01:21:16.422 --> 01:21:19.659
Map it out so you don't run out
the end of every month.

01:21:19.690 --> 01:21:21.360
No, that's not it.
I--I need it.

01:21:21.391 --> 01:21:22.459
It's been tight.

01:21:22.492 --> 01:21:25.197
Going off my shift,
so if you don't mind...

01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:27.534
- I'll take care of it.
- I got it.

01:21:27.565 --> 01:21:29.365
- Give me the check.
- It's on me.

01:21:29.397 --> 01:21:30.566
What are you doing?

01:21:30.599 --> 01:21:32.268
I'm paying for breakfast.

01:21:32.302 --> 01:21:34.272
You acting the big shot?

01:21:34.304 --> 01:21:37.243
Let me just pay for breakfast
in front of my kids.

01:21:37.274 --> 01:21:39.476
You haven't paid for anything
your whole goddamn life.

01:21:40.175 --> 01:21:43.281
BELLE: Mickey, sweetheart,
stop it. Let him pay.

01:21:43.311 --> 01:21:45.381
- Belle, it's the principle.
- I know.

01:21:45.412 --> 01:21:47.182
If he pays the check, it's still me.

01:21:47.215 --> 01:21:48.383
Let's not play games.

01:21:48.438 --> 01:21:51.341
I've been paying for you
for 50 years, Murray.

01:21:54.058 --> 01:21:55.428
Not in front of the kids, Mick.

01:21:55.459 --> 01:21:57.061
You think
they're mental midgets?

01:21:57.094 --> 01:21:58.997
You're not fooling anybody.

01:21:59.029 --> 01:22:00.897
Ask your daughter
who pays the bills...

01:22:00.929 --> 01:22:02.832
who bought the clothes
on her back...

01:22:02.865 --> 01:22:04.368
the shoes on her feet.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.938
I'll tell you what.
I'll take care of the check.

01:22:06.970 --> 01:22:08.172
Where's the girl? Miss!

01:22:08.204 --> 01:22:10.506
Belle, put your money away.
He needs to hear this.

01:22:10.537 --> 01:22:13.409
Who's keeping your kids
in Beverly Hills? Who, you?

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:14.576
Come on.

01:22:14.609 --> 01:22:16.411
They're not stupid, Murray.
They know.

01:22:16.444 --> 01:22:19.483
The money in your pocket comes
from my goddamn bank account.

01:22:19.514 --> 01:22:21.515
Let's put our cards on the table.

01:22:21.547 --> 01:22:23.884
Let 'em know who their real father is.

01:22:23.916 --> 01:22:25.386
I'm their father.

01:22:25.418 --> 01:22:27.455
I'm supporting your
fucking family their whole life!

01:22:27.486 --> 01:22:29.256
What are you doing?!

01:22:30.257 --> 01:22:31.657
Aah!

01:22:31.688 --> 01:22:33.425
BELLE: Oh, God.

01:22:33.457 --> 01:22:38.799
[GASPING] She--she--she--
Poppy...

01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:41.332
I'm pregnant.

01:22:41.364 --> 01:22:44.002
Takes a fork
and stabs me in the leg.

01:22:44.033 --> 01:22:45.302
BELLE:
I know, darling. I know.

01:22:45.335 --> 01:22:46.603
That's the thanks I get.

01:22:46.636 --> 01:22:47.771
Please!

01:22:47.803 --> 01:22:49.606
Can you give us a ride?!

01:22:49.639 --> 01:22:51.142
My husband is wounded!

01:22:52.274 --> 01:22:54.711
MURRAY: Mickey!

01:22:54.742 --> 01:22:56.145
Mickey!

01:22:56.177 --> 01:22:57.145
VIVIAN: Dad!

01:22:57.178 --> 01:22:58.681
Mickey!

01:22:58.713 --> 01:23:00.015
Let them go!

01:23:00.048 --> 01:23:01.883
Goes to detox and gets pregnant.

01:23:01.915 --> 01:23:03.050
What is this?

01:23:03.082 --> 01:23:04.250
MURRAY: Mickey!

01:23:05.318 --> 01:23:06.788
Mickey!

01:23:06.819 --> 01:23:07.954
VIVIAN: Dad!

01:23:11.591 --> 01:23:13.693
Let them go.

01:23:15.893 --> 01:23:18.098
MURRAY:
I don't have anything.

01:23:18.130 --> 01:23:19.699
I got nothing left.

01:23:19.730 --> 01:23:21.133
RICKEY: Dad.

01:23:21.166 --> 01:23:23.501
VIVIAN: You got us, Dad.

01:23:23.532 --> 01:23:24.701
Dad.

01:23:49.856 --> 01:23:51.291
VIVIAN: With Rita gone...

01:23:51.325 --> 01:23:53.961
there'd be no more monthlies
from Uncle Mickey.

01:23:53.992 --> 01:23:55.729
No more plush shag carpeting...

01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:58.132
fancy dinette sets,
or swimming pools.

01:23:58.164 --> 01:24:00.767
No more Camelot...
of Beverly Hills.

01:24:00.799 --> 01:24:03.604
Just a future filled
with cheap rents and dingbats.

01:24:03.635 --> 01:24:05.938
ELIOT: So, what is it,
like, over between us?

01:24:05.970 --> 01:24:07.105
Is that it?

01:24:07.137 --> 01:24:09.407
VIVIAN: I told you.
It was a building thing.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:12.012
Oh, great. So you used me?

01:24:12.042 --> 01:24:15.146
For my car, to lose
your virginity? W-what?

01:24:15.177 --> 01:24:18.116
I liked you, OK?

01:24:19.748 --> 01:24:21.050
I like you.

01:24:22.084 --> 01:24:23.787
I just can't get attached.

01:24:23.819 --> 01:24:28.324
Why not?
My family. I can't.

01:24:29.756 --> 01:24:31.493
We're nomads.

01:24:36.729 --> 01:24:39.468
Better get out of here.

01:25:19.499 --> 01:25:21.002
MURRAY: OK, everybody in?

01:26:02.369 --> 01:26:04.874
Hey, doesn't Eva Gabor
live around here?

01:26:07.541 --> 01:26:09.376
Ben, doesn't she?

01:26:09.407 --> 01:26:12.146
I don't know, Viv.

01:26:13.546 --> 01:26:15.716
Thought someone told me that.

01:26:18.083 --> 01:26:20.386
Hey, that's it. Right there.

01:26:20.417 --> 01:26:22.954
Rickey, look.
That's Eva Gabor's house.

01:26:22.985 --> 01:26:24.121
Who?

01:26:24.154 --> 01:26:27.026
Eva Gabor, from "Green Acres."

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:29.094
Where's Eva Gabor?

01:26:29.126 --> 01:26:31.896
That one. You see it?
With the marble portico.

01:26:31.927 --> 01:26:33.529
That's hers.

01:26:33.563 --> 01:26:34.865
Whoa.

01:26:34.896 --> 01:26:37.267
Yeah, uh, you know, she--

01:26:37.299 --> 01:26:40.303
she's supposed to have
this weird thing for poodles.

01:26:40.334 --> 01:26:42.204
She, like, breeds them
or something like--

01:26:42.236 --> 01:26:44.707
like a poodle farm in her backyard.

01:26:44.738 --> 01:26:46.975
Whoa, weird.

01:26:49.143 --> 01:26:52.146
Dad, what do you say
we get some steak...

01:26:52.177 --> 01:26:53.947
we get some steak
for lunch?

01:26:53.979 --> 01:26:57.485
Not today.
I'm not in the mood.

01:26:57.516 --> 01:26:59.152
You know, I could eat.

01:26:59.184 --> 01:27:00.952
I mean, I need to beef up
for my role.

01:27:00.984 --> 01:27:04.324
You know, I got the part, Dad.
Sky Masterson is mine!

01:27:04.355 --> 01:27:07.325
Brando played him in the movie, right?
That's right.

01:27:07.358 --> 01:27:09.695
Yeah. "Guys and Dolls."

01:27:09.726 --> 01:27:11.360
Terrific picture.

01:27:11.393 --> 01:27:14.565
Frank Sinatra--Nathan Detroit.

01:27:14.597 --> 01:27:16.534
VIVIAN:
Come on, Dad. It'll be fun.

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:20.172
We'll eat steak, get our strength up.

01:27:20.202 --> 01:27:23.839
Then we can look for our new place.
What do you say, Dad?

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:25.441
We'll get 'em
how you used to serve them--

01:27:25.473 --> 01:27:28.478
this thick, seasoned, rare...
and bloody.

01:27:28.510 --> 01:27:29.678
BEN:
Yeah, Dad.

01:27:29.710 --> 01:27:31.745
MURRAY: All right.
Who's hungry?

01:27:31.777 --> 01:27:33.514
RICKEY:
I am.

01:27:33.546 --> 01:27:35.716
MURRAY:
OK. Let's go to Sizzler.

01:27:35.747 --> 01:27:38.252
Yes! Yeah!

01:27:43.087 --> 01:27:44.522
VIVIAN: I used to think
the good life...

01:27:44.556 --> 01:27:47.662
was somewhere just outside
the window of my father's car...

01:27:47.692 --> 01:27:50.364
but now I see it's on the inside.

01:27:50.395 --> 01:27:52.330
Sure, we didn't know where
we were going to live...

01:27:52.362 --> 01:27:54.532
but we knew where we were going.

01:27:54.564 --> 01:27:57.469
For us, the Abramowitzes
of Beverly Hills...

01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:00.806
a meal at Sizzler
meant that we were halfway home.
